BUT THERE WAS A SHARE I TO I AM PROUD TO PRESENT THREE ALONGSIDE MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION LAURA FRIEDMAN HI FI FIRST LIKE TO OFFER THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF THE ACLU AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSIONS ULTIMATELY LED TO THIS APPROACH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. HAS BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR ROAD SAFETY SAFETY AND HAS LED THE CHARGE INTERESTING SIDESHOWS AND STREET RACING WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY LED TO DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR PEDESTRIANS AND DRIVERS STATEWIDE I AM HONORED TO LEND MY TIMES ARE FOR HER TO PRESENT TODAY. I WANT TO THANK A ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU MR- THAT MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL IN YOUR ASSISTANCE AND THAT OF YOUR STAFF. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY TO BRING OUR SIDE SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH OUR- TRAFFIC LAWS ABOUT SPEED CONTESTS. SIDESHOWS REFORM OF ORCHESTRATED SPEED EXHIBITION THAT OCCURS. WHEN TWO OR MORE VEHICLES WORKTOGETHER TO BLOCK TRAFFIC. TO DO THE VEHICLE STANDS TO DO SPEED CONTESTS- ON OUR PUBLIC STREETS. PUTTING THE PUBLIC A GREAT JEOPARDY. NOW WE HAVE LAWS- DEALING WITH SPEED CONTESTSWERE TWO CARS ARE RACING SIDE TO SIDE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME LAWS IF SOMEONE'S DOING IF WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR VEHICLES DOING DONUTS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. DOING RACING ONE BY ONE AND OTHER DANGEROUS AND RECKLESS BEHAVIOR. SO THE ATTEMPT OF THIS BILL IS TO GIVE. THOSE JUST AS DANGEROUS- CONTESTS THE SAME GRAVITY UNDER THE LAW. AS STREET RACING. NOW WE KNOW THAT IN LOS ANGELES THIS IS A HUGE AND GROWING PROBLEM. AS MOVIES ENGINE UP THE IDEA OF THESE TYPES OF CONTESTS WE HAVE SEEN DEADLY RESULTS. WITH PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN OUR DISADVANTAGED IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE DEATHS AND INJURIES. BECAUSE OF THESE BE CONTESTS. ARE THE MY DEATH IN TWO THOUSAND ROAD BY 24% AS LESS PEOPLE WERE DRIVING ON THE ROAD WHICH IS THE SINGLE GREATEST INCREASE YEAR INCREASE IN NINETY SIX YEARS. CHP RESPONDED TO OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALLS PER SPEED CONTESTS AND MOTOR VEHICLE EXHIBITIONS OF SPEED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. NEARLY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE CHP HAS DETERMINED THAT SPEEDING IT KILLED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND BECAUSE ALMOST SIXTY THOUSAND INJURIES. SPEEDING IS RESPONSIBLE 431% OF ALL TRAFFIC FATALITIES. IN THIS COUNTRY. AND MOTOR VEHICLES EXHIBITIONS OF SPEED LIKE SPEAK CONTACTS ADDED EXTRA LAYER OF OFFENSIVENESS. TO SPEEDING IT'S NOT JUST GOING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU MAYBE DIDN'T NOTICE EARLY TO WORK IT'S DOING IT JUST TO SHOW OFF FOR OTHER PEOPLE. THESE DANGEROUS SIDE JOBS ARE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGAL ENTERTAINMENT AND WE NEED THE DISCRETION. TO HIT PEOPLE WHERE THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT WHICH IS SUSPENDING THEIR LICENSE FOR A SHORT TIME TO BASICALLY SHOW THEM. THAT DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT AND THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO USE THAT CAR AS A TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE NOT AS A WEAPON. WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- TO THE CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION I- YOU KNOW I GENERALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT BILLS LIKE THIS- WILL I WILL I LET ME REPHRASE THAT I THINK FOLKS ARE ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR PROBABLY NOT CHECKING THE PENAL CODE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY THEY SHOULD BE DOING WHEN THEY DECIDE TO STREET RACE- SO I AM WONDERING IF THERE IS. ANY DATA ON- IF THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED AND ENACTED IN OTHER STATES AND IF SO WHAT'S BEEN ITS RATE OF AFFECTED BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO CURB THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY. CONTRA APPRECIATE QUESTION UP. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA FOR- REMOVING ARE SUSPENDING SOMEONE'S LICENSE WHEN IT COMES TO DO EYES OR TO ACTUALLY TO STREET RACING SPECIFICALLY IT'S BECAUSE AS- DETERRENCE RATE IS ACTUALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT- I WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE CHP HERE- FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC DATA BUT- THE REDUCTION OF- RECIDIVISM. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO- DO YOU EYES ABOUT 65% AND THE REDUCTION IN RECIDIVISM WHEN IT COMES TO- STREET RACING THIS BE CONTACTED SO IT'S ACTUALLY OVER THE CBS BUT- CERTAINLY DIFFERS THIS DISEASE BE IF THEY'RE HERE. HAPPY TO LEND. ABOVE THEN THE MY TIME. IF HAVE. I AM SURE THAT THE SUPPORT BY JUNE KAMARG VIA DE TO ADDRESS THAT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY COVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL- ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL. HI THIS IS V. IS AWARE THAT- THAT SPOT EXHIBITION SPEED. DOES PRESENT A UBIQUITOUS PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS- TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO RECIDIVISM. I YES WE DO HAVE DATA WITH RESPECT TO RECIDIVISM RATES. TO FOR A SPEECH CONTEST CURRENTLY. LAW DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS ARE STATUTORILY AUTHORIZED- FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A SPEED CONTEST- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL THE COURT CASES ADJUDICATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA COURTS BORDER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE DRIVER LICENSE SUSPENSIONS. AFTER SPEED CONTEST CONVICTIONS. AND RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM RATE DROPPED A NINETY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA COURTS ORDER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY DEAL SUSPENSIONS. AND THE RECIDIVISM RATE DROP NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT PERCENT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CALIFORNIA COURTS ORDERED THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DRIVER LICENSE SUSPENSIONS AFTER CONVICTIONS. AND THE RECIDIVISM RATE A RATE DROP NINETY NINE POINT FOUR PERCENT. OF THE TWENTY TWENTY CASES THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED THUS FAR. OF THE RECIDIVISM RATE DROPPED THERE ARE NO CONVICTED OFFENDERS. THAT HAVE BEEN A RE CONVICTED. FOR A SPEED CONTEST VIOLATION. I THINK THE QUESTION ALSO WAS IS THERE ANY STATES THAT HAVE ENACTED LAWS SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THIS- ST EXHIBITIONS AND- OCCUPYING INTERSECTIONS AT THIS BILL IS REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER STATE DATA ARE READILY AVAILABLE FOR THAT. OKAY THE CONGRESS. YOU'RE RIGHT. SENATOR I'M TROUBLED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THIS C. H. P. REPRESENTATIVE- THROUGH THE CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE ACLU AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO- ADDRESSED THE- OR HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONSIDER HOW THE LOSS CAN AFFECT DISPROPORTIONATELY- CERTAIN COMMIT. A COMMUNITIES THAT THE CHP HAVE ANY DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON THE INDIVIDUAL CITED FOR EXHIBITION OF SPEED. YES MA'AM- SO THIS ISSUE DOES PRACTICALLY TRACK. DATA WITH RESPECT TO EXHIBITION BE. INCLUDED IN THAT THAT DATA TRACKING IS A DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF ALL CG CITATIONS AND ARRESTS. I'M SO OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR A VIOLATION OF EXHIBITION S. B. HISPANICS LATINOS REPRESENTED FORTY SIX POINT 4% OF ALL HIS FEET ARRESTS AND CITATIONS. WHITES REPRESENTED THIRTY EIGHT POINT CITATIONS. ASIANS REPRESENTED FOUR POINT 5% OF ALL SEIZE PEREZ AND CITATIONS. OF BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. REPRESENTED FOUR POINT 4% NATIVE A REP- POINT 4% OF ALL ARRESTS AND CITATIONS. AND THE REMAINING FIVE POINT 8% REPRESENT- AND ETHNICITY OR RACE THAT WAS QUOTED AS EITHER OTHER OR UNKNOWN. OF THOSE ARRESTS AND CITATIONS OVER 96% MORE- WERE MALES. WHEN COMPARED TO EITHER FEMALES TRANS GENDER OR- GENDER NON CONFORMING. MANY DISCUSSIONS NO ONE OF- SENATOR ASSEMBLY MINIMUM FONG I APPRECIATE ARE YOU WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE I TO HEAR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO- THIS BILL- AND I. AGREE THERE IS A GROWING PROBLEM WITH EXHIBITIONS- SPEED IN THE THREAT THAT IT PUTS THE GENERAL PUBLIC NOT ONLY DRIVING PUBLIC A WALKING AS WELL AND I'VE SEEN WHAT IT DOES AND- OCCUPYING INTERSECTIONS FOR. SOMETIMES HOURS AT A TIME- WITHOUT ANY RESPONSE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND IT IS A GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT YEAH I WOULD I TOO WAS QUESTIONING- ANY. HISTORICAL DATA OF HOW THIS IS WORKED IN OTHER STATES FOR OTHER. AREAS AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NEW TO FALL FOR ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S A GROWING PHENOMENON. OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BUT IT'S ONE THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY GOTTEN OUT OF HAND EVEN TO THE POINT OF. JUST WHAT IT DOES TO THE STREET HIS OWN TEARING UP ASPHALT AND- LEAVING BEHIND ON TO SCREECH MARKS ALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TO- I JUST WANT TO KNOW- YOUR CURRENT ADDRESS STOOD- I WILL SEE THREE DID. BUT OUR- FULL FOLLOW AREA ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ANYTHING OR CLOSE. BY THE CERTAINLY THIS THAT THE RATE OF INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS HAVE HAVE HAVE RISEN- CERTAINLY WELL AWARE OPENED AT SEIZE PLEASE OPEN TO COLLECTING THE DATA AS WE MOVE FORWARD- BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE- AS THE CHAIR TRANSPORTATION INDICATED- THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM STATEWIDE AS AS AS YOU SAID MISTER CAIR- THE DATA THAT SHOWS. THE SAME TYPES OF- WHO WOULD THAT WE LOOK AT SUSPENSIONS OF LICENSES FOR OTHER TYPES OF A SIMILAR ACTIVITIES THAT THE REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM IS SIGNIFICANT- SO- THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL BRINGS THE PARITY- THE TWO BEHAVIORS THAT ARE RELATED A NUMBER OF TIMES IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE. IN SPEECH CONTESTS THEY ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN SUCH AS SO THIS BILL VERY NARROWLY DEFINES WHAT A SIDE SHOW IS AND APPLIES- THAT PARITY- SIMILAR TO- ST CONTEST. A TO THAT BEHAVIOR. I'M A BIG BIG GREAT COURTROOM JUST OUR SYSTEM. IN LIEU OF LICENSE SUSPENSION HAD BEEN CONSIDERED HAVING AN INDIVIDUAL- BEAR THE COST OF ST REPAIRER ANY DAMAGES THAT WERE DONE FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES. BUT WELL MOST OF THE- THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT ATTEMPTS AT LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN IMPOUNDMENTS OR- AND ENHANCED FOUNDRIES HE FELT THAT THIS WAS- SOMETHING THAT CREATED PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BEHAVIORS- WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO THAT IDEA- MAYBE IN THE FUTURE BUT NO THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU- WE TALKED CLOSE DIED I JUST WANNA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK I WANT TO THANK US HERE IN OUR FAMILY FROM TRAVELING ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM BIGGER STILL TO SHARE HER STORY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE.

I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH INCLUDE CLARIFICATION OF THE PRINT AND RADIO MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO BRING AWARENESS TO THE EDUCATION DEGREE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM. I AM PROUD TO PRESENT% AB EIGHTY NINE TO PEACE OFFICER EDUCATION AND AGE CONDITIONS PROCLAIMING ACT PART PIECE ACT. THE PEACE AT FIRST INCREASES THE MINIMUM AGE FROM EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE ALIGNING WITH THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND LEGAL AGE TO POSSESS A FIREARM IN THE STATE. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES POST HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS FACULTY MEMBERS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DEVELOP AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE FOR TRANSFER INTO MODERN POLICING. THE NEWLY DEVELOPED A WILL INCLUDE COURSES IN PSYCHOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS HISTORY ETHNIC STUDIES AND THOSE IN CRITICAL THINKING AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. AND EARNING THIS DEGREE INCOMING PEACE OFFICERS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED IN SKILLS NECESSARY FOR DE ESCALATION WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY OF COMMUNITIES OF VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS. WITH ONE OF THE BEST TUITION COMMUNITY TUITION FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS IN THE NATION THIS MODERN POLICING NAY WILL BECOME AN ASSESSABLE OPTION TOWARDS A CAREER IN POLICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST DIVERSE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT POPULATION. AFTER A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO PROVIDE TIME FOR THE DEGREE TO BE OFFERED ALL CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS MUST BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE THAT CAME EITHER TO NEWLY CREATED DEGREE IN MODERN POLICING. OUR PASTORS DEGREE IN THE DISCIPLINE OF THEIR CHOOSING THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I HAVE HAD IT ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND EFFORT TO CONCERNS REGARDING THE IMPACT THIS BILL MAY HAVE. A RECRUITMENT TO RECRUITMENT POOL POOL ESPECIALLY OUR RECRUITS OF COLOR IN RESPONSE THE PIECE THAT ALSO REQUIRES POST TO DEVELOP A FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS COMMITTED TO THE NEW AGE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION. AND A MEDIA PROMOTION TO BRING AWARENESS TO THOSE WITH ACCESS BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION WHEN ELEVATED EDUCATION ENTRY STANDARDS ARE EXPECTED OF OUR EDUCATORS. AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE ALSO DEMAND THE BEST OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS IMPROVING. CONDITIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT WILL STRENGTHEN CAN MANY TRUST ALOFT. AND ENSURE SAFETY ESPECIALLY CAN MEMBERS OF. WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY VICTIM TO EXCESSIVE FORCE AT THE HANDS OF PEACE OFFICERS THE PIECE THAT WILL PROFESSIONALISE POLICING BY ENSURING A MORE MATURE. AND BETTER EDUCATED WORK FORCE AS WELL AS TRANSFORM DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. MARKING A TRANSITION IN ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES BEHIND EXCESSIVE FORCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL R. ESTEBAN NOON YES ON BEHALF OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. COALITION CO SPONSOR OF THE PEACE ACT AND JENNIFER FELDMAN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. THEY WERE BOTH TESTIFIED VIA REMOTE TELECONFERENCING LINE. IT WILL GIVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES A TO MINUTE HAVE EACH TO MAKE YOUR TESTIMONY SO MISSING KNOWING US IF YOU'RE READY YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER MODERATOR. THANK YOU SIR KAREN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS THAT BY NOON AS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS ARC. ARC MEMBERS KNOW VERY WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING PEACE OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT WORK WITHIN CORRECTIONS. TO HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO MAKE OBJECTIVE DECISIONS IN HIGH STRESS HIGH STAKES SITUATION. WE MUST CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZING HAVE POLICIES THAT REFLECT BRAIN. THE PREFRONTAL. WHICH GOVERNS EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF REASONING ADVANCED DOT AND IMPULSE CONTROL IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL THE MID TWENTY. NINE SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE POLICY THAT GUIDES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. I MEAN PROPER EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. OR IF FULLY DEVELOPED BRAIN HELPS INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY DEVELOP A DEEPENED UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO CRIMINALITY SUCH AS TRAUMA. THIS REDUCES THE RISK OF UNLAWFUL OR IMPULSIVE USE OF FORCE AND INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF REHABILITATION FOR THOSE INCARCERATED. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ON THE INCARCERATED I SPENT SIX YEARS IN PRISON FOR THE TRAGIC ANIMATRONIC VERSION THAT MADE MY USE. DURING MY INCARCERATION I WORKED IN MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND MY DECISION BEHIND MY DECISION. IN DOING SO I THOUGHT SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM MY FAMILY PEERS AND EVEN CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. IN MY EXPERIENCE IT WAS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO ACHIEVED A DEGREE IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAT TREATED ME AND THOSE INCARCERATED AROUND. NEED A HOPE AND COURAGE TO WORK TOO MUCH PROBLEM. I ALSO FOUND THOSE WITH NO HIGHER EDUCATION OR MARKET TO SPEAK TO US YET QUICK TO FOLLOW IN THE LEADERSHIP OF OTHERS. WHO REGULARLY DEMEANED AND BELITTLED. WITH NO REGARD FOR REHABILITATION OF SUPPORT. CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY BUT ALSO IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO GUIDE. OUR INCARCERATED COMMUNITY THROUGH THE REHABILITATION PROCESS. THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE CARCERAL SYSTEM RELIES ON OFFICERS WHO CAN OPERATE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY WHILE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE INFLUENCE OF TRAUMA. THE DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN MATURATION FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO THE SYSTEM BEFORE THE MID TWENTIES. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE WE BELIEVE AND IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE. THAT BOTH EXIST. HELLO HELPED SHAPE A CALL SHIFT BY DEEP AND- TO YOU. HELPING TO PROMOTE POSITIVE. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE ABOUT ON A. B. EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY GOODNESS.

YOU KNOW I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE THAT- BOOK SMARTS- AND AKADEMI ARE THE ONLY ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW I'M- ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. IS THAT IT PROVIDES YOU THE SPACE. TO LEARN SKILLS- PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS DECISION MAKING SKILLS- TIME MANAGEMENT- IT PROMOTES DISCIPLINE- AND ALLOWS YOU THE SPACE THE SAFE SPACE. TO EXPERIMENT WITH THOSE SKILL SETS AND FAIL. AND THEN LEARN NEW TOOLS AND SKILLS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS BILL HOW DO WE- CREATE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. BY ENCOURAGING- THESE RECRUITS. WHO HAVE THESE KINDS OF SKILLS BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING- ON THE NEWS AND IN REPORTS AROUND- POLICE MISCONDUCT. REALLY HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF FAULTY DECISION MAKING OR FAULTY PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS- AND SO I THINK THIS IS- AN ELEGANT APPROACH AND YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IF NOTHING ELSE IT MIGHT ATTRACT A DIFFERENT CALIBER OF RECRUITS AND I THINK ULTIMATELY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT WE WANT TO SEE SO I THINK YOU AGAIN I'M FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK CENTER CENTER TROUBLE. SEVERAL CLARIFICATION PURPOSES- WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ARE TAKING YOU ARE ACCEPTING TO LOWER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE SO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION HAD BEEN- HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR. AGE OUR AGE AND THEN NUMBER TWO JUST- SO NOW IT IS I UNDERSTAND IT'S TWENTY ONE YEARS WITH A DEGREE OR BY COMPLETING THE NEW DEGREE PROGRAM OUR CHURCH ON SEPT I POSTED AND THAT'S THE STANDARD TRAINING RIGHT RIGHT CORRECT WITH THE NAY GOSH SO HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE- TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN WE TALK TO THE PROFESSIONALS. THE SPECTER AS FOR SHIA. ONE OF. THAT ARE CAL STATEFULLERTON DR CHRISTINE GARDNER SHE RECOMMENDED TWENTY FIVE- AND AS I ALSO DID MY OWN IT IS OBVIOUS IS NOT. EMPIRICAL WORK IN ANY WAY BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK TO A LOT OF. WOMEN WHO Nó MEN A LOT OF THEM WILL SAY THAT MOST MENTAL MATURING JULY THIRTY SO TWENTY FIVE SEEM LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO START. THAT DISCUSSION BUT THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT- GIVEN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. A GUN AND A LICENSE TO KILL AND THEN PUT HIM OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE STREET JUST I THINK IT WAS APPARENT EVEN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THAT BECAME A GOOD COMPROMISE ALSO SINCE A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALREADY KIND OF STIPULATE TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO STARTS. IS MATURE ENOUGH AND WIDE ENOUGH THIS IS ABOUT. QUALITY OFFICERS GOING AND NOT QUANTITY OF OFFICERS GOING TO. AND DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW THE PROFESSOR I CAME UP WITH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE BUT STATE DOES SO OUR DOCTOR CHRISTINE GARTNER RESEARCH FROM CAL STATE FULLERTON SHOWCASE THAT INCREASE EDUCATION REQUIREMENT. DOES NOT NECESSITATE A GROUP TYPE REDUCTION AND THAT'S IT ELIGIBILITY OF MINORITY CAN IN FACT NATIONAL RATE THE SERVICE SHOWN THAT- ROLE THAT THE RECRUITMENT CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS HAVE OFTEN REQUIRE THAT SO SHE ALSO DID STUDIES ON THE FRONTAL LOBE AND I THINK YOU I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THE COMMITTEE BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF- STUDIES. ON PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF CRIMES IN FACT IF YOU'RE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE'VE SAID THEY MAY NOT BEEN TO MATURE ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE DONE A HEINOUS CRIME THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE MENTAL CAPACITY OR THE MATURITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING SO WE'VE WE AS A AS A STATE WE'VE LOWERED THAT BECAUSE OF NOT JUST HER BUT OTHERS HAVE COME IN. AND TESTIFIED THAT- OLDER BUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS SEEM TO BE THE AGE WHERE WE WOULD SAY LOOK AT THAT AGE AND OLDER THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND SO WE'VE WE'VE ALLOW PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE SOMETHING YOUNGER TO GET OUT EARLIER FOR A FEDERAL CRIMINAL SIDE SO WHY AREN'T WE DOING THAT ON. THE ON THE POLICE ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU HAVE SOME JONES SAWYER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA HI TO- THE LESSER ME BELIEVE. A- COLLEGE DEGREE IN IT OF ITSELF GOING TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE- MORE WORLD EXPERIENCE MORE- KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS GOOD- AND WE KNOW THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS. IN THIS COUNTRY IN IN STATE- OVER DIPLOMA THOMAS SO. I THINK IT WOULD BE- WE ALL WOULD ALL BE BETTER SERVED IN WILL CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF A GREATER DEGREE IN TRUSTING CONFIDENCE IF- THEY DID HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPOSURE- TO THE WORLD AND IF THAT'S TO THE COLLEGE DEGREE THEN I'M ALL FOR THAT- SO I WANT TO. THANK YOU FOR. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND BRING THIS MATER FORD AND- FOREIGN. ALL WHO ARE YOU CLOSE. BUT WHEN THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE FOR. AMENDMENTS FOR. HAVING THIS SPACE. TO DIVE IN AND ADVERTISED FOR PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND MINORITIES I THINK WILL ALSO. HELP BRING THIS IS A CLASSIFICATION OFFICERS TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIVERSE. SILENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR AMENDMENT BECAUSE I. THINK IT WAS A BRILLIANT WAY. TO EXPAND THAT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A TO PASS AS AMENDED TO COAX A SENATE APPROPRIATIONS OR CHICKEN AMID- MOTION ON AV EIGHTY NINE. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CALM WATER COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THE V. EIGHTY NINE AB EIGHTY NINE BRADFORD BY APHRODITE CHOI BOGUE I. HELLO GUYS DURAZO COM LOGGER NINE. ONE MARKER I SKINNER. THE MEASURE OF THREE VOTES WILL LIBERAL OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS SHOT OFF. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO FOLLOW NUMBER THREE AB TWO TO THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD AFTER WE DO OUR HOUSE. KEEPING WILL YOU CAN GET IN YOUR TESTIMONY. THEY MEDICARE MEMBERS ARE I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF WITH OFFERING PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO AB TWO TO THREE THAT CHANGES THE MINIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND OFFENSE BY POACHING DUDLEYA CAPS THE MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR FINES AND CHANGE THE PENALTY FROM A PER PLANTED TO RESTRICT DOLLAR VALUE VIOLATION THE MOMENTS WILL ALSO CREATE AN EXEMPTION FROM THE PENALTIES FOR PURCHASING OR SELLING DUDLEYA. UNDER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN VALUE TO ENSURE THAT THE FOCUS IS ON THE LARGE POACHERS AND NOT SOMEONE WHO MISTAKENLY FIND THEMSELVES IN POSSESSION OF A FEW ILLEGALLY HARVESTED PLANTS THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS COME OUT OF DISCUSSIONS YESTERDAY WITH THE ACLU AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND I UNDERSTAND WITH THESE MEMBERS OF THE ECL WOULD REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. BUT WHAT IS AB TWO TO THREE IT MAKES IT UNLAWFUL TO TAKE DE LEON FROM ITS NATURAL HABITAT ON LAND OWNED BY THAT STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR ON PROPERTY THAT'S NOT ONE'S OWN DUDLEY IS A GENUS OFSUCCULENTS THAT INCLUDES FORTY SEVEN SPECIES TWENTY SIX OF WHICH ARE FOUND IN NATIVE HABITATS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RECENTLY THIS GENUS HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY POPULAR AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES A SINGLE PLANT A TYPICALLY SELL FOR FIFTY TO EIGHTY DOLLARS AND SOMETIMES UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A LARGER MATURE DUDLEYA PLANTS AS A RESULT POACHERS HAVE BEEN HARVESTING DUDLEY ABOUT THE THOUSANDS TARGETING THESE LARGER MORE MATURE PLANTS ALONG OUR COAST AND THEN SHIPPING THEM OVERSEAS AND SELLING THEM ELSEWHERE. WHILE THE COURTS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN PENALIZING POACHERS THE FINE AMOUNTS THAT CAN BE LEVIED ARE MINUSCULE WHEN COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY POACHERS COULD MAKE SELLING THE PLANTS ON THE UNDERGROUND MARKET THE PENALTIES ESTABLISHED THROUGH TV BE TWO TO THREE ARE ANALOGOUS WITH RECENT LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS IVORY AND SHARK FIN POACHING. SO BY EXPLICITLY MAKING IT UNLAWFUL TO POACH DUDLEYA AND ESTABLISHING STRONGER PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS AB TWO TO THREE WILL HELP DETER THIS POACHING AND PROMOTE EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE LINE TODAY I HAD NICK JENSEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY TO TESTIFY BY PHONE IN SUPPORT AND.

TIM GRAYSON HAS MR HOLDEN JUST WALKED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LAST SESSION I AUTHORED A SIMILAR BILL BUT AND I ALSO STATED THAT MY INTENT TO FIND A LONG TERM FUNDING SOLUTION FOR AIR MBULANCE PROVIDERS- WOULD BE MIGHT WITH WOULD BE MY GOAL AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FOUND A LONG TERM SOLUTION. EMERGENCY ERR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM EMS THEY ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN HOMELAND SECURITY AND DISASTER RESPONSE INCLUDING THE EVACUATING OF HOSPITALS IN THE PATH OF WILD FIRES AND RESPONDING TO COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS EVERY YEAR THAT THE PROVISIONS OF A MODEL MUST BE EXTENDED BECAUSE THE A GREAT DEAL OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR AROUND FOUR AND LET'S PROVIDERS EXIST FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR. TO THE LEGISLATORS LIMITED ABILITY TO MEET BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS THE PROVISIONS OF AMADA EXPIRED AND THE PROVISIONS OF A MODEL AGAIN EXPIRED. ON JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. EDIT CAL AIR AMBULANCE RATES HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THEY WERE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED IN JULY OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE. AND AS WITH OTHER EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS IS PLACED AN ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC STRAIN ON PROVIDERS. THE US ANY REDUCTION OF FUNDING PROVIDED BY A MODEL AT THIS TIME WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY PLEASE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF MANY EMERGENCY HELICOPTER BASES. AT RISK OF CLOSING PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS AND THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL TO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MEDIC CAL UTILIZATION. AB ELEVEN OH FOUR WILL PROVIDE A TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF A MODEL TO ALLOW THE AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS TO CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE LIFESAVING SERVICES IN THE INTERIM AFTER THAT THE MODEL WILL BE PHASED OUT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WILL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT. A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PROGRAM PROVIDE A LONG TERM OVERDUE RATE INCREASE. MY WITNESS TODAY IS CHRIS KELLER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF AIR MEDICAL SERVICES.

TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT COUNTS SIX PRESTON BMP. I ACCEPT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE AGREED UPON AND I HOPE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS SATISFY YOUR SENATE COLLEAGUES. THAT WANTED TO SEE US COME TO A RESOLUTION ON THE TRAINING AND REPORTING ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. TURN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWENTY NINE A BILL THAT PROHIBITS A PERSON REQUIRED. TO BE REGISTERED AS A SECURITY GUARD FROM CARRYING OR USING A FIRE ARM OR BATON UNLESS THE SECURITY GUARD IS AN EMPLOYEE. OF A PRIVATE PATROL OPERATOR LICENSEE HARM POORLY OF THE STATE. MEMBERS AS THE COUNTRY WHAT'S THE TRIAL OF DIRECTOR CHILDREN. THE EX POLICE OFFICER CHARGED WITH THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. THERE WAS A SIMULTANEOUS DISCUSSION REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE TRAINING OF THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. THE CONVICTION OF THEIR CHILDREN WAS THE FIRST STEP IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD NOW THE NATION SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE OTHER THREE OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT FAILED TO INTERVENE AND ULTIMATELY WATCHED. AS GEORGE FLOYDS FINAL MOMENTS ON EARTH EXPIRED. BUT TODAY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BRING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT THERE. ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT CARRY FIREARMS OF THE TAUNTS. THEIR EMPLOYEE TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROPERTY SAFE AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL DEALINGS. OF BUSINESS BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY ARE HARD TO KEEP THE PEACE AT SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS. THEY ARE OUR PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS. WHILE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS DIFFER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY OFTEN FACE SIMILAR SITUATIONS EVEN TRAGIC ONES. MEMBERS MARIO MATTHEWS WAS A MEXICAN AMERICAN WHO WORKED AS A WAREHOUSE WORKER. ACCORDING TO A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS PARENTS ON JULY SECOND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT AROUND THREE THIRTY AM AFTER ATTENDING AN OUTDOOR CONCERT FOLLOWING TO IN THE ACCIDENT NBA EXPERT TO EXHIBITION GAMES. MARIO ENTER THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. UP TO OPEN DOOR WHICH WAS PART OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SHOWED MARIO RUNNING AROUND THE COURT AND DRIBBLING AS IF HE WAS PLAYING BASKETBALL. INTO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL BEGAN SIXTY MARIO AND EVENTUALLY DETAINED HIM. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT MARIO WAS SLAMMED FACE FIRST INTO A WALL TACKLED AND RESTRAINED FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR. WHEN THE BILL'S HANDS WERE HANDCUFFED BEHIND HIS BACK AND THE TWO SECURITY PERSONNEL GOT ON TOP OF HIS BACK. WHILE SECURITY GUARDS USE HIS RIGHT KNEE TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE SIDE OF MARIO'S MAC. MAXIMALLY FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. IN ADDITION TO THE IITIAL TO UNIVERSAL PROTECTION SECURITY PERSONNEL A THIRD SECURITY OFFICER PLACED HIMSELF ON MORROW'S BACK. LARA BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. HE PASSED AWAY TWO DAYS LATER THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THAT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY CORONER KNOWLEDGE THAT RESTRAINT WAS A CAUSE OF MORROW'S DEATH. ADDITIONALLY THE CORONER'S PATHOLOGIST NOTED DEEP BRUISING TOMORROW'S BACK AS A RESULT OF THE WEIGHT AND PRESSURE THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON HIM. MARIO WEIGHED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS. WELL THE NATION DEBATES LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING AND THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS CURRENTLY HAVE NO TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR COURSES ON THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. AB TWO TWENTY NINE WOULD ADD THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE TO THE TRAINING COURSES WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES ACT INCLUDING TRAINING ON THE USE OF OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE FORCE. DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE COURSE IN THE CARRYING AND USE OF FIREARMS TO INCLUDE TRAINING IN THE APPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD HELP SAVE OTHERS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THIS STUART KATZ AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FAMILY OF MARIO MATTHEWS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. YOUR PRIMARY WITNESSES PREPARED YOU MAY BEGIN ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SHARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TO WORK AT. FAMILY OF MERRILL MATTHEWS AFTER THAT CASE ARE EERILY PRESCIENT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOYD IN TERMS OF THE PRESSURE FROM THE NECK. BUT SENATE PRETTY I WOULD NEED AND THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE I DON'T LIKE WITH GEORGE FLOYD THESE INDIVIDUALS DID NOT HAVE THE TRAINING THAT INDICATED THAT. WHAT THEY WERE DOING WHAT IMPACT LIFE THREATENING. BOB ACCOUNT IN THE COURSE OF MY THIRTY PLUS YEAR CAREER MULTIPLE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THE REALLY TRAGIC. ANNIVERSARY OUTCOMES WITH SECURITY GUARDS WHO SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING COOLEY ONE CASE WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL ARE ALMOST. 11% OF BODY YOU SUFFERED THIRD DEGREE BURNS FROM BEING CHALLENGED. ON A PARKING LOT. NECESSARY IN OF FACT THERE ARE MORE SWEET WHITE RICHARD GUARD IN THE WORK OFFICERS. INTERSTATE CAL. APRIL INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC PAPER GLENROCK WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WHO HAVE VERY FORMS OF DISABILITY IS OF A MENTAL NATURE OF PRIMARILY IN IMPORTS OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. AND INTERACTION WHERE YOU BRING GET A TRAGIC CON. AND THESE POSTERS DON'T HAVE ANY TRAINING- THE ROLE OF BENEFIT THIS TRAIN WILL PROVIDE GOING FROM ZERO TO AT LEAST TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES AN HOUR IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAV- THERE'S NO COST REALLY IS TRYING TO RESTORE CORD OUT OF TRAINING IT IS ADDITIONALLY NOT TO HAVE REQUIRED OF TRAINING REGARDING THE USE OF FORCE. WHICH WE PROMOTE CREDIT CONSEQUENCES I WOULD URGE AND REQUEST THAT YOU DO APPROVE THE- BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE ROOM MOVES HERE TO SUPPORT. AB. TWO TWO NINE. IF YOU ARE A WE NEED TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION. ON ITS PART OF OUR AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE HERE IN TWO TWO NINE C. I MEAN TO FORTY TWO OH THREE C. NINE NOW WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM OF. TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE MODERATOR OTHER CALLERS IN Q. WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWO NINE. IF YOU WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWO NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. PICTURE NONI QUEUING UP IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. OKAY NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE A ALEX HAD X. THE CORRECT WHO'S HERE IN OPPOSITION OR TESTIFYING TELEPHONICALLY. YES SIR IF YOU THIRTY MAYBE GAINES TESTIMONY US THROUGH MOST. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ALEX HADDOCK'S AND I'M A CO OWNER OF SECURITY TRAINING CENTER WHERE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES JOB TRAINING FOR THE PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY. WE DO NOT OFFER PHYSICAL SECURE SECURITY SERVICES WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON NEW JOB TRAINING AND CONTINUED SECURITY EDUCATION ASK PRESCRIBED BY THE B. S. I. S. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO NINE. THE PROVISION IN AB TWO TWO NINE THAT MAKES THE INITIAL EIGHT HOURS OF TRAINING CALL THE POWERS TO ARREST COURSE EXCLUSIVELY LIVE CLASSROOM TRAINING IS TERRIBLE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND DISENFRANCHISED IN FOR THE WORKING POOR AND UNDER EMPLOYED. IT WILL COST PEOPLE LIFE CHANGING JOB OPPORTUNITIES WHICH BASE TO REALLY NEED NOW MORE THAN EVER. OUR PRIVATE SECURITY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED THEY ARE NOT GRANTED SPECIAL POLICE POWERS THEY HAVE NO MORE SPORTY THAN YOU OR I DO. SECURITY GUARDS ARE CIVILIANS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO OBSERVE AND REPORT. THEY'RE INSTRUCTED TO INTERVENE IN EXTREMELY LIMITED PASSIVITY AND CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN APPROPRIATE. HOW TO RISK COURSES NOT JUST THE FIRST COURSE STERN A SECURITY GUARD LICENCE IT IS THE COURSE WHERE THE LIMITATIONS ON AUTHORITY ARE TAUGHT. MOST SECURED EMPLOYERS WILL NOT INTERVIEW A CANDIDATE UNLESS THEY'VE ALREADY COMPLETED THE POWERS TO ARREST CORPORIS AND HOLD A SECURITY GUARD LICENSE. ALL EMPLOYMENT AND FUTURE TRAINING PROHIBITS ON THIS ONE COURSE. TALENT COULD LIMIT DISCOURSES ACCESSIBILITY TO ONLY THOSE WHO CANAFFORD TO TRAVEL TO A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM CREATES AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS SEEKING BETTER JOBS. USING OUR COMPANY AS AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE TWO FACILITIES IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA. SO FAR THIS YEAR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE TRAINED ELEVEN PEOPLE ON THE POWER TO ARREST. DURING THE IDENTICAL PERIOD WE HAVE TAUGHT THE SAME COURSE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX TIMES ONLINE. ELEVEN VERSES ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX. THAT'S OVER A THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN CALIFORNIA USING ONLINE JOB TRAINING. THE FLEXIBILITY OF ONLINE TRAINING ALLOWS THE UNDER EMPLOYED AND WORKING POOR TO GET THE CRITICAL JOB TRAINING THEY NEED TO RESTART THEIR LIVES. THE SAME GROUP OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD A PERSONAL CAR THEY MUST RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS DO NOT HAVE LOCAL TRAINING FACILITIES. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FACILITY CAN BE A HUGE BURDEN OR INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER. BUT AGAIN ONLINE TRAINING IS THE BEST SOLUTION HERE NO TRAVELS NEEDED. THE TRAINING CAN BE KEEP COMPLETED ON A SMARTPHONE TABLET OR COMPUTER FROM A HOME OR SHELTER. IF NONE OF THESE DEVICES ARE OWNED OR CAN'T BE BORROWED THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE USED. EVERY TOWN HAS A PUBLIC LIBRARY BUT NOT EVERY TOWN HAS A SECURITY GUARD TRAINING FACILITY. THE BETTER JOB INSECURITY OR A SECOND PART TIME JOB AND SECURITY CAN HELP LIFT THE WORKING POOR AND UNDER EMPLOYED OUT OF POVERTY. THE FLEXIBILITY THAT ONLINE JOB TRAINING OFFERS SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED. NOT ONLY CAN THE TRYING TO BE COMPLETED FROM HOME BUT IT CAN ALSO BE COMPLETED AT ANY HOUR. RATHER THAN SIX TWO BUSINESS HOURS ONLINE TRAINING ALLOWS A CANDIDATE TO COMPLETE THE COURSE WORK DAY OR NIGHT. DON'T AFTER A LONG DAY THE WORKING PARENT CAN COME HOME SPEND TIME WITH THE FAMILY AND THEN COMPLETE THE JOB TRAINING AFTER THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP. JUST AS IMPORTANT THE ONLINE JOB TRAINING DOES NOT FORCE THE WORKING PARENT TO SKIP A DAY OF WORK TO ATTEND TRAINING FOR A SECOND OR BETTER JOB. BUT LEGISLATION IS CURRENTLY POSED BUT PROPOSED SHOULD BE AMENDED TO PERMIT ONLINE TRAINING TO CONTINUE AS IT IS PRESENTLY AUTHORIZED BY THE BSS. IN ADDITION I SUPPORT THE STRENGTHENING OF THE BASIC TRAININGS- TRAINING AS SET FORTH IN PROPOSED LEGISLATION. AND OFFER MY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN FURTHER INTO THE SCHOOL. WE NEED TO KEEP HIS JOB TRAINING ACCESSIBLE AND KEEP IT AFFORDABLE TO ALL- ACCESS TO ONLINE JOB TRAINING WILL UNFAIRLY AFFECTED THE ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHY SIMPLY BILL TWO TWO NINE CANNOT PASS AT AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. ONLINE TRAINING MUST BE PRESERVED. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO THE HEARING ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE ARE THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO TWO NINE. SHE NINE WILL GO TO R. OR FLOOR ROOM AND THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL MODERATOR DO WE HAVE CALLERS DESIRING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO TO KNOCK. IF YOU LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE DO HAVE ONE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THAT'S ONE A TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. LOCHER AND MEMBERS JERRY DESMOND ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED INVESTIGATORS. NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THAT ARE WERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT. THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE IN ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY AS A- AND A AND A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESS SOME ARCANE PROVISION IN THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ACT. SINCE PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS DO NOT HELP THE- STATUTORY POWER TO ARREST. OR TO USE FORCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS CLARIFIED IN THE LAW. THAT LACK OF POWER AND THAT THE APPLICATION THE BILL. NECESSARY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR SURE NO ONE ELSE IS QUEUED UP IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME RIGHT- BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR AS SOON HOLDEN AS IT RELATES TO AB TWO TWO NINE. YES CENTER TROUBLE. I JUST HAD A QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED EARLIER- WITH THE- THE FORMER EDUCATOR I'M ALL ABOUT CHOICES AND OPTIONS- BUT YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING AN ONLINE. COMPONENT YES THE BILL PART OF WHAT WE ADDRESSING OUT OF THE BMP DISCUSSION COMMITTEE DISCUSSION WAS THAT THE BILL WOULD HAVE 50% CLASSROOMS 50% ONLINE. BECAUSE OF SOME OF WHAT IS BEING EXPECTED TO RAISE THE GOING TO PROBABLY REQUIRE IN PERSON TECHNIQUE TRAINING SIMULATION AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND BUT NO THIS IS NOT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF HOW THESE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE TRYING TO BE- SECURITY PERSONNEL THEY CAN BE DONE ONLINE AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND SO THE BILL STILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT. TO OCCUR. AND HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE- THE IN PERSON- COMPONENT THAT IS REQUIRED CURRENTLY AND IT'S- ITS ABILITY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT COULD QUALIFY TO- ATTEND OR PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CARL SAGAN TO ADDRESS THESE TYPE OF ISSUES AND I MEAN I TERMS OF IN A CLASSROOM THERE ARE- LOCATIONS AND IT'S MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH A PROGRAM THROUGH- EXISTING. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH KOUSEI GOOD TO KIND OF INSTRUCTORS AND SHOW US HOW THIS WOULD BE WORKING OUT AS WELL BUT WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING THEY SUPPORT. HERE WE ARE. BECAUSE I THINK CLEARLY THIS IS- AS WE'VE SEEN NOT ONLY IN THE INSTANCE THAT I. RECITED AND MY PRESENTATION BUT WE'VE SEEN IT IN SAN DIEGO. WHERE OUR SECURITY PERSONNEL BASICALLY NOT EXACTLY KNOWING HOW TO USE TECHNIQUE APPROPRIATELY. KILLED AN INDIVIDUAL DOWN IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA- AND SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE AND MORE INSTANCES WHERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE OF GREATER FOCUS. ON THESE HOW THESE TECHNIQUES ARE USED DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES IN THE LIGHT BECAUSE THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC AS WELL. AND SO TO HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING THAT IN SOME INSTANCES REQUIRE IN PERSON. IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING. THAT THE ONLINE IS A PORTENT- VEHICLE THAT CAN STILL BE ACCESSED FOR PEOPLE TO. TO GET THE TRAINING OFFERED AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATURE. THE LAST SPEAKER WHO. MADE REFERENCE TO SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WE ARE WORKING. WITH AND THAT JUST CAME OUT RECENTLY. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO- GARON'S AROUND ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK THEY'RE ALL TECHNICAL AS HE SAID AND WE'RE- WILL BE COMFORTABLE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I'M UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE MEMBERS THAT YOU AGREE TO AND BMP AND THAT WILL WORK AS IT REGIS COMMITTEE TO GONNA THAT'S CORRECT OKAY HOW COULD NOT I'M TO THE POINT. THE SAME ISSUES WERE BROUGHT UP AND THOSE ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE 50% FINALIZATION AREN'T BURKE SHINO FOR THE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS- MISTRAL WHICH ELECT CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. ARE WE WERE SEEKING A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED OR WILL BE AMENDED AND GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS MOST MOTION BY SENATOR COM LONGER. COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB TWO TWO NINE. AB TWO TO NINE BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE CHOI BOGUE I DROBO GUIDE TERRAZZO COM LONGER. COME UNDER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER I. BUDGET COMMITTEE. THANK YOU WE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER SIX EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY TWO WHICH FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER LACKEY AND ONCE WE HAVE PREPARED THE PODIUM WITH PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHTY TWO. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE BILL WHICH WAS AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM. THE AUTHORIZED VERSION FOR ALL MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES EXCEPT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING. CRIMES THAT WOULD REQUIRE A PERSON TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER. HOWEVER THIS BILL CREATED AMBIGUITY AND POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH SPLIT STATE LAW BECAUSE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE SECTION TWENTY THREE SIX FORTY. ALREADY PROHIBITS DO YOU EYES AND DELAYS WITH INJURY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION. FURTHERMORE THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZED THIS COMPLEX LAST YEAR SIGNING MESSAGE WHICH HE STATED HE WANTED TO REVISIT THIS POLICY AND QUOTE UNQUOTE EXPLICITLY. HOW DO YOU AYE CRIMES TO THE INELIGIBLE LIST FOR DIVERSION. WELL THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS DIY APPROACHES FROM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION. THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES ANY AMBIGUITY THAT COULD ARISE WITH LAST YEAR'S AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR THE STATION ALL THE LIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION. DIVERSION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR OFFENDERS. IT ALLOWS OFFENDERS TO ESCAPE CONVICTION AVOID JAIL TIME AND HAVE THE REST RECORDS RELATED TO THE CRIME HE RACED. FURTHER ALLOWS DANGEROUS OFFENDERS TO AVOID LIMITS ON FIREARMS POSSESSION AND DENIES VICTIMS COMPENSATION. FOR THEIR INJURIES OR LOSS. DURING MY TIME AS A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THE WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE SCENE OF A COLLISION THAT INVOLVED A FATALITY. AND THE DRIVER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLISION WAS AN IMPAIRED DRIVER. IT'S A TRUE TRAGEDY ON ALL ASPECTS. MY AGE I FELT DISHEARTENED ALSO FOR THE DRIVER. THEY WERE UNAWARE OF THE TRUE. DANGER THEY POSE TO THE PUBLIC. HARDEST PART IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO NOTIFY A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAT- THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS NEVER GONE HOME AND I DID THAT OVER FORTY TIMES ANYWAYS. DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. AS PART OF MY LIFE. AND I CAN'T ERASE THE MEMORIES THAT I HAVE OF THE TRAGEDY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. PROBLEM IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH WITH ME TODAY IS NINA SOLARO MUSSELMAN WITH CRIMES I'M SORRY WITH CRIME VICTIMS UNITED AND AMANDA WITH AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE. WE HAVE A K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> LEAD WITNESS ON THE ONLINE. YEAH THE REPORT OF THE SMOKER AND ATTENTION AT IT. PLEASE PROCEED MA'AM. I WANT TO THANK. THE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS OF CALIFORNIA. WHY WE SUPPORT REHABILITATIVE MEASURES FOR THOSE WHO HAVE- OFFENDED AND HURT OTHERS IN SOCIETY WE ALSO ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE COUNT ABILITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ALLOWING DIVERSIONS FOR UNDER THE INFLUENCE DRIVERS IS. CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY CALIFORNIA HAS A POINTED OUT BY THE ASSEMBLY MEANT. DO YOU LIVE PLAGUE OUR STATE THEY TAKE LIVES STATE NAME PEOPLE WE- THIS PROCESS IS GREAT MORE PEOPLE DIE FROM DIY INJURIES. AND IF WE ALLOW FOR DIVERSION WE ARE THEN NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO TEACH THEM WHEN SOMEBODY IS CONVICTED OF A FIRST TIME DUI OFFENSE. THEY ARE MANDATED TO GO TO DO YOU AYE SCHOOL THEY ARE MANDATED TO TAKE VICTIM IMPACT PROGRAMS THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED THAT ALLOWED PER DIVERSION. IT DOESN'T STATE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THESE OFFENDERS WOULD DO FOR DIVERSION AND THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO WHOEVER THE SENTENCING COURT WAS SO COULD BE VERY WELL AND VERY WELL MEANING BUT THAT SOMEBODY THAT HAS COMMITTED A FIRST TIME OFFENSE UNDER G. WHY WOULD NO LONGER BE MANDATED TO TAKE THE VICTIM IMPACT PROGRAM. YOUR PARTICIPATE IN THE LIVE CALL PARTICIPATE NAY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TRUTH OF THE PROBLEM IS ADDICTION AND IF WE ALLOW TO VERSION TWO X. EIGHT ALLOW PEOPLE TO SKATE PERHAPS LEARNING FROM THE ABILITY TO MEASURES THAT WE ARE JUST DOING A REPETITIVE PROBLEM. THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH- ALLOWING PER DIVERSION HAS POINTED OUT. BY ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY. THE VICTIMS COMP IN THE VICTIMS WHO WAS KILLED WHAT YEAR IS INJURE. THEY HAVE A TO FREE- RECOUP SOME OF THEIR LOSSES AND IF DIVERT PEOPLE ADAM. THEM IT EIGHT FROM THE ABILITY. TO INTO THE COMED. THE OLD. IT IS VICTOR. THAT IS HARMED BY ALLOWING THE CUSTOMER. AS WELL SAFETY ON THE OF CAL. BECOMES THE CRIME AND I'M OF CRIME VICTIMS.

ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL VEHICLE CRASH FATALITIES AND DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING IS QUICKLY ON THE RISE. A VERSION PREVENT GENERALLY LEAD TO DISMISSAL OF THE CONNECTION AFTER COMPLETION OF AN EDUCATION OR TREATMENT PROGRAM AND CAN PREVENT THE OFFENSE FROM APPEARING ON OFFENDERS PUBLIC DRIVING RECORD. RESEARCH SHOWS FIRST LAND CONVICTIONS ON DRIVING RECORD OFTEN DO NOT REFLECT FIRST TIME OCCURRENCES. AND MANY LOCAL BIRTH CAN DELAY UNDER ALREADY HAD EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING BY THE TIME THEY'RE CONSIDERED DOCUMENTED ON THE PUBLIC DRIVING RECORDS.

THANK YOU MR MODERATOR HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FROM ANY OPPOSITION. WE DO HAVE TO LEAD- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE JOSH WERE PRICE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA D. Y. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. IN PERSON WE. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOSH FOR PRICE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU AYE LAWYERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY TO EIGHTY TWO UNLESS AMENDED TO INCLUDE FIRST OFFENSE MISDEMEANOR THE WIVES. I'M NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE Y. DRIVERS I'M NOT IN SUPPORT OF NOT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS WHAT I AM IN SUPPORT OF IS GIVING WELL DESERVING INDIVIDUALS A SECOND OPPORTUNITY FOR. PEOPLE TO GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND RIGHT THE SHIP SO THEY'RE NEVER BACK BEFORE THE COURT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE IS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. REPEAT DIY OFFENDERS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER TO ZERO OR CLOSE THEIR TO. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE I PRACTICE WE HAD A TERRIFIC JUDGE THE LATE HONORABLE ROGER CROUSE. HE HEADED VETERANS COURT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS THAN HE DID MILITARY MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION FOR OVER SIX YEARS. OVER 90% OF HIS CASELOAD. WAS THE WIFE ENTERS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH RECIDIVISM HE HAD OVER SIX PLUS YEARS ZERO. PERSONALLY PRACTICING D. Y. DEFENSE AND DOING DIVERSION FOR DIY OFFENDERS FOR OVER SIX YEARS I'VE HAD ZERO RECIDIVISM. AND PEOPLE PENAL CODE SECTION ONE THOUSAND ONE NINETY FIVE PASSED THIS YEAR THERE IS DISPUTE AMONG COURTS AT FIFTY WISER ELIGIBLE BUT IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT THE WHITES HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE THERE'S BEEN ZERO RECIDIVISM AS FAR AS MY KNOWLEDGE TODAY. DIVERSION WORKS AND I THINK THERE'S A BIG MESS PER DAY MISCONCEPTION THIS IS FOR MISDEMEANOR FENCES NOT FELONY THE WHY IS NOT MANSLAUGHTER D. WHY IS THE RESULT IN DEATH. OR SERIOUS INJURY THIS IS MISDEMEANOR FIRST OFFENSE D. WHY IS. WHERE PEOPLE ARE SUPPORT ADVERSELY AFFECTED YOU HAVE ONE OUT OF FOUR OCCUPATIONS THAT REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL LICENSE THAT'S A LICENSING BOARD THEY HAVE THAT THEY GET PUNISHED BY. YOU HAVE. DACA RECIPIENTS. THAT WILL BE DEPORTED NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR DACA ON A FIRST OFFENSE. DUI CONVICTION. YOU HAVE MILITARY PEOPLE THAT OTHERWISE DON'T QUALIFY FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR G. JUDICIAL DIVERSION- THAT MAY GET KICKED OUT OF THE MILITARY. AND SO IT GIVES THESE PEOPLE A SECOND OPPORTUNITY AND JUDGES ARE GOING TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES HERE OKAY IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET SOMEBODY INTO A DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND AS THE ATTORNEY YOU WORK WITH THE COURT WITH THE PROSECUTOR AND SET UP. THINGS ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THEY WOULD DO THE OFFENDER WOULD DO IF THEY WERE CONVICTED IN COURT. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALMOST A QUARTER OF FIRST OFFENDERS REOFFEND EVERY YEAR. DIVERSION A FULL LOWER THAT FREE AND I'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND. SO SOMEONE GOES INTO PLEADS GUILTY YES THEY HAVE TO DO A FIRST CONVICTION PROGRAM VICTIM IMPACT PANEL PAY A FINE THEY'RE ON SUMMARY PROBATION NO OVERSIGHT WITH THE VERSION OFFERS UP TO TWO YEARS UNDER THE THUMB. OF A JUDGE. WHERE DEFENDANTS ARE COMING BEFORE THE COURT. EVERY THIRTY TO NINETY DAYS. WRITING LETTERS ON SELF REFLECTION. DOING TREATMENT OR WHATEVER THE COURT ORDERS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL CASE. AND IT PROVIDES CALIFORNIAN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAFER. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES THERE'S AT LEAST TEN OTHER STATES OFFER SIMILAR DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR A FIRST OFFENSE D. Y. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE ON A MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE GIVE HAVE FAITH IN THE JUDICIARY AS THE GATEKEEPERS. TO MAKE THAT DECISION BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO QUALIFY FOR DIVERSION ALL RIGHT BUT THOSE THAT DO SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHANCE AT REDEMPTION TO MAKE OUR STATE SAFER TO EDUCATE THEM SO THEY CAN TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. AND I WOULD ASK FOR A NAY VOTE ON. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY TWO. UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PRICE WE ALSO HAVE ROSE CON SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER AND SHE I BELIEVE SHOULD BE ONLINE MODERATOR. YES AND HERE. MY NAME IS ROSE CON AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER RIGHT DIRECTOR WORK AT THE INTERSECTION OF CRIMINAL ON IMMIGRATION LAW. WE HAVE BEEN DEEPLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS LEGISLATURE CONSISTENT RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR CREE CREE DIVERSION UNDERSTANDING THAT TREATMENT NOT CAGES ARE ESSENTIAL TO APPROVING THE CAUSES OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT. ENDING THE CYCLE OF HARM AND IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS CELL WHICH WOULD LIMIT A JUDGE'S DISCRETION TO GRANT DIVERSION IS THE MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR MANY REASONS. BUT I CALLING TODAY TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DAMAGE THIS BILL WILL COST AND THEN. THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HOLDS OVER A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY IMMIGRANT POPULATION AND OVER A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY DACA APPLICANTS. I THINK HUNDRED INSIDE CONVICTIONS ARE TREATED PARTICULARLY HARSHLY UNDER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION. FOR EXAMPLE. DACA IS BARRED THEY HAVE A SINGLE E. Y. CONVICTION ON THEIR RECORD SIMILARLY A LONGTIME GREEN CARD HOLDERS SEEKING TO OBTAIN U. S. CITIZENSHIP WILL BE BARRED FROM DOING SO IF THEY WERE TWICE CONVICTED OF THE D. Y. WITHIN THE PAST TEN YEARS. UNDER CURRENT. DIVERSION PROGRAMS ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO ACCESS NECESSARY TREATMENT WHILE PROVIDING A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE ELIGIBILITY FOR SOME FUTURE FORM OF IMMIGRATION EIGHT. IF THE CURRENT LAW IS AMENDED SO THAT INDIVIDUAL CHARGE NOT CONVICTED YOU Y. OFFENSIVE CANNOT ACCESS BY VERSION NONCITIZEN DEFENDANTS WILL HAVE NO IMPACT IT SHOULD. BE AND WILL INSTEAD HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO TAKE THEIR CASE TO TRIAL BY THE CHANCE OF A DEPLORABLE CONVICTION COSTING THE STATE MORE MONEY ONE TIME. RIGHT HOW CAL WITH THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT BY VERSION A JUDGE DECLINE TO A DIVERSION AND OR TO GRANT ALL BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT. LUXURY THE CASE BY CASE JUDICIAL ECONOMY THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL. AND AVOID ADOPTING HARMFUL BRIGHTLINE PROBATION. PLEASE VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL WILL GO TO WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM ARE THERE WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM WHEN HE XIN TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO EIGHT TWO. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HI MY NAME IS LINDA AROUND LIKE AND I'M A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY- FROM BERKELEY CALIFORNIA. I STRONGLY OPPOSE AB TWO EIGHTY TWO UNLESS IT IS AMENDED. AB TWO READY TO PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THE Y. CASES FROM CONSIDERATION FOR MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION THE AMENDMENT WHICH IS A WELL REASONED APPROACH WOULD ALLOW CONSIDERATION A DIVERSION FOR FIRST TIME D. Y. CASES IN VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE THE JUDICIARY TREMENDOUS LEEWAY IN TERMS OF THEIR ANALYSIS OF WHO WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND WHO WOULD NOT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRST TIME DO YOU LIVE IN IS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FELONIES WERE CAUGHT NOT TALKING ABOUT MAN'S EYES WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU.

TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THAT'S TWO SEVEN ONE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JAY BASKET ON THE HEALTH COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPPOSE. Q. AND WE HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES THANK YOU WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BUT IT'S COMING. RELATES TO. HE TO A TWO. SENATE SKINNER- I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY WERE LUCKY LUCKY YOU CITED A REFERENCE- FROM THE GOVERNOR AROUND- MAYBE IT WAS A VETO MESSAGE I'M NOT SURE- NO NOT AS APPROVAL- IS AN APPROVAL WHERE OKAY- HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO GOT COURT CASES THAT INDICATE WE HAVE TO THAT WE. WHEN WE MAKE CHANGES TO THE PENAL CODE INTO CERTAIN ALLOWING FOR DIVERSION FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TO APPLY IT FAIRLY AND THAT WE HAVE A- I SHOULD READ DIRECTLY FROM THE HOUSES ANYWAY. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE CONFRONTED IN THE PAST CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. WE HAVE MADE EXCLUSIONS THAT WERE THEN RULED TO BE NOT A FEAR APPLICATION. AND SO. THERE THAT ASPECT OF THE- ANALYSIS. MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME BUT IN ADDITION THOSE WITNESSES WHO TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO. NOT ONLY MONITOR THE PERSON BUT TO ALSO IN EFFECT BE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF THE- PROGRAMMING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY DO TO ADDRESS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED. TO THE D. Y. N. IS. WELL NOT EVERY D. WHY IS SOMEONE WHO IS AN ALCOHOLIC IS VERY COMMONLY AND ALCOHOLISM AS WE KNOW IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM THAT IT IS NOT AN EASY. IT'S AN EASY THING TO OVERCOME AND SO WELL I DO NOT WANT. I DO NOT WANT DRUNK DRIVERS AND I DO NOT WANT THE CONSEQUENCES OF DRUNK DRIVERS BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS CAN SOMETIMES RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY- REDUCING THE END IN THE NUMBER OF DRUNK DRIVERS AND THE INTERESTING THING I FOUND IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN INCREASING. A LOT OF OUR PENALTIES TOWARDS DRUNK DRIVING WHICH AGAIN IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING AND YET WE'VE OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS. ONLY SEEN A THE WHITES. I'VE NOT YET SEEN ANY KIND OF STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT THE DIVERSIONS ARE LESS EFFECTVE IN TERMS OF THE REDUCTION OF THE D. WEISS. AND THERE IS IT WE OBVIOUSLY NEED MORE DATA TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT BUT THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT SOME OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE SO I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL IN THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED- SO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AS AS- AN- AS WRITTEN TODAY. AT YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS VIA COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO. I TO- SOON MARK YOU HAVE CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THE RIVER DIVERSION SPECIALLY FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS AND MISDEMEANORS I THINK- FIRST CALLING FROM BERKELEY. CLEARLY STATED- THE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN BY OFFERING SUCH DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND ARE GIVING PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO- CHANGE REALIZE VERSUS LOSING THEIR LICENSE OR GOING TO JAIL AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE- FLEXIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR QUITE SOME TIME- FOR THE FOR THE MISDEMEANOR FIRST ON FENCES SO. I TO HAVE CHALLENGES SO WE OFFERED UP SOME AMENDMENTS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE MOMENTS ARE NOT CORRECT YOU ARE CORRECT. OKAY ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT SO THAT THE TO CLOSE YEAH WITHOUT. OPPORTUNITY CLOSE YOU MAY CLOSE. FIRST OF ALL- I WANT TO TAKE A THE COMMITTEE WITH OLDER SOME HARSH DISAGREEMENT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND WHETHER YOU ACCEPT OR REJECT THE FACT THAT THE ALLIES ARE AS DANGEROUS AS I CLAIM THEY ARE. DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE LIVES LOST EVEN TODAY AS WE SPEAK BECAUSE OF AN IMPAIRED DRIVER. SPEAKING OF SENATOR SKINNER TO YOUR POINT. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM IS THIS PART OF THE IMPORTANT REMEDY TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND TO ADDRESS APPROPRIATELY NO MATTER WHAT LEGISLATION WE PASSED HERE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE IMPAIRED DRIVING BY THE VERY NATURE OF ALCOHOL. THE GOAL IS TO LIMIT THOSE THOSE TRAGEDIES. AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL CLEARLY. DO THAT AND THE REASON WHY WILL DO IT IS BECAUSE IT WILL. EIGHT AWARENESS DIVERSION DIMINISHES AWARENESS OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT RACES AT- AND THAT THE AMENDMENT FIRST OF ALL THE FIRST TIME CONVICTION IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS THE SECOND OR THIRD. AND I WOULD SAY THAT- IT'S TRAGIC IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC THE SERIOUSNESS OF DIY AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE MANY OF US HAVE FRIENDS WHO PROBABLY. BY LATE THIS LAW AND THEY'VE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF NEGATIVE ENCOUNTER. BUT I PROMISE YOU IT'S LIKE. A RUSSIAN ROULETTE EVENTUALLY THE BULLETS GOING TO SHOW UP. AT IT'S VERY TRAGIC WHEN IT DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I COME FROM A PLACE OF NOT. GETTING ANY INCITEMENT ABOUT. TAKEN SOMEBODY INTO CUSTODY IT'S A COMPASSIONATE MOVE BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU. THE NUMBER OF THOSE DO YOU AYE TRAGEDIES OFTEN WERE SOLO COLLISIONS. SO GUESS WHO THE VICTIM WAS WAS ALSO THE PERPETRATOR OF THE PROBLEM. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO GO OUT AND GET TO THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS AWARENESS. AND WE DIMINISH AWARENESS WE DID MANAGE OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS. THIS PROBLEM FOR WHAT IT TRULY TRULY IS NOT A TRAGIC TRAGIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- I MEAN IT'S LIKE SHOOTING A WEAPON INTO A GATHERING OF PEOPLE AND HOPE THAT THE BALL IT DOESN'T HIT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH FOLKS AND I'M TRYING TO BRING REMEDY TO THIS PROBLEM AND I HOPE I GET YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE SEEKING A MOTION ON. AB TWO EIGHT TWO THE MOVED IT IS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR REPORT THE TROUBLE- THERE IS A- TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS.

RESTRAINTS. THE CALLS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA IS A DEADLY CONDITION. THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN A PERSON IS RESTRAINED AND CANNOT BREED. AFTER THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOOR LAST YEAR I AUTHORED LANDMARK LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY SIX TO BANLAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING CHILL CALLS. THE OFFICER WHO KNEELED ON FLOYD'S NECK DID SO FOR MORE THAN NINE MINUTES. AND TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS. UNTIL HIS BODY LAID LIFELESS. BUT ALSO IN DECEMBER. BUT LAST YEAR AND LOOKING TO. BY UNITED STATES NAVY MEANT FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S ALSO TRAGICALLY KILLED AT THE HANDS OF POLICE. ANGELO HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH EPISODE.

ANGELO KATO SAID PLEASE DON'T KILL ME PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLANKS. IT'S NOT ABOUT TWO WEEKS. IT'S NOT ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THIS. THIS IS ABOUT LIVES. THERE ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL CONTINUES TO STATE THAT THIS BILL REMOVES AN OFFICER'S ABILITY. AND I WANT TO QUOTE. FROM ONCE. RESTRAINING BUT INDIVIDUAL LET ME SIMPLY SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU CAN STILL RESTRAIN AN INDIVIDUAL WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS YOU CANNOT CUT SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO BRIEF. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE THAT TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM WHILE IN CUSTODY. IT STATES THAT NGUYEN PRESSURE OR BODY WEIGHT IS BEING PLACED ON SOMEONE AND UNDER REASONABLE POSITION. IT CUTS OFF SOME OF THE BILITY TO BRIEF. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AND LOOKING SO. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE FLOORED LET ME BE CLEAR THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN NOT YOU CAN NO LONGER. JEFF CUT OFF SOMEONE'S EAR WAY WITHOUT CARING. FOR THEM YOU CANNOT CUT SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO BREED OFF YOU CAN STILL ARREST HIM YOU CAN STILL DETAINED THEM. BUT NOT CUT SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO BREATHE AB FOUR NINETY THE COMMONSENSE POLICY. THAT IS NEEDED NOW TO CLOSE A LEGAL LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW USING. THE USE OF FORCE THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IT WILL PLACE A LIMIT ON RESTRAINTS USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE THAT THESE RESTRAINTS DO NOT TURN TO BE UNNECESSARILY DANGEROUS AND DEADLY. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY.

ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS HERE ARE REGARDING AB FOR NINETY CENTER SKINNER. I WILL MOVE THE BILL HI- THANK YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF FRIENDS WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE- KING TO A FAMILY AND WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS INCIDENT WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF ITS OCCURRENCE- AND IT WAS TRULY HORRIFIC I MEAN THAT. THE ME BEFORE I SAY MORE. THIS BILL IS NEEDED INDEPENDENT OF THE HORRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT THE KING TO FAMILY FACED I AGREE AND THE BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE SUCH A RESTRAINT. CAN KILL PEOPLE AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AS WAS DESCRIBED IN BY THE AUTHOR AND THE WITNESSES. IT WAS A MENTAL HEALTH CALL. AND THE FAMILY WAS. I DIDN'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO WITH THE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BUT BY THE TIME THE OFFICERS ARRIVED THE FAMILY MEMBER HAD. IT MORE OR LESS CALM DOWN. AND- WAS NOT ARMED AS WAS DESCRIBED AND YET WAS PUT IN A HOLD. THAT TEN BECAUSE THIS CONSEQUENCE WHERE I DID THIS FAMILY NO LONGER HAS THEIR LOVED ONES SO THEY DID WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT AND YET THEN THIS OCCURS SO. I'M SURE THE OFFICERS DID NOT INTEND TO KILL. ANGELO CANTO AND YET THE HOLD THAT THE USED BECAUSE THAT SO. WE HOPE THERE'S NOT APPROPRIATE TIME TO USE SUCH A HOLD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LEARNING THAT'S WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO USE THAT TO HOLD IT IS TO LEGAL. AND SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL I REALLY- MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY BUT TO ANY. ANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE. FIVE REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE HAD THE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH A HOLD BECAUSE A PATH TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBER- SO APPRECIATE DIFFERENT BILL BEING BROUGHT AND- OF IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER I TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORTH WHAT IS USUALLY CONSIDERED COMMONSENSE MEASURES- WE'VE LEARNED FROM EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE THAT SUCH RESTRAINT AREN'T NECESSARY STRUCTURE THEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS NOT ARMED NONVIOLENT HAVING A- MENTAL ISSUE THAT REQUIRES. SOMETHING LESS THAN- DEADLY FORCE TO- CONTROL FOUR INTERVENE AT AT THAT SITUATION AND I THINK IT'S CLEARLY ANOTHER THIS- EXAMPLE OF THE LACK OF. REVERENCE FOR LIFE WHEN IT COMES TO. THE POOR AND BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AGAIN A LOT OF- MORE FEDERATION CONSTRAINT ISSUES BEFORE APPLYING THESE THESE TECHNIQUES AND MORE- FLUENT COMMUNITY SO I THINK IT'S CLEARLY- NOT ONE OF TRAIN MANY PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO THROW IT BACK TO TRAINING BUT- THEY SEEM TO GET IT RIGHT IN THE RIGHT COMMUNITIES BUT WHEN YOU'RE- ARE YOU SEE IN A POOR MINORITY COMMUNITY WITH THE SEEM TO RESPOND WITH SUCH ACTIONS SUCH AS THESE SO I THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH EXAMPLES FROM THEIR GARDENS OF THE WORLD TO. THE GEORGE FOR ITS TO MISTER KING TO HEAR SO ARE A TOTALLY SUPPORT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND I THINK YOU AN INCH. IF YOU'RE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE CALLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TO SENATORS FOR YOUR KIND COMMENTS WE REALLY PREACH I WANT TO THANK. BECAUSE IT TAKES A VERY STRONG CURRENTS- FOR THE MOTHER OF ANGELO TO TESTIFY- AND THE SISTER WHO ACTUALLY MADE THE CALL- TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION.

UNDER CURRENT LAW OUR COURTS CAN ISSUE PROTECTIVE ORDERS AGAINST PERPETRATORS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF STALKING THEIR CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR PERPETRATORS TO CONTACT A TRIP SURVIVOR DIRECTLY BY TELEPHONE OR USING PHYSICAL MAIL IN VIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER. HOWEVER THE REALITY OF OUR MODERN WORLD IS THAT IT'S INCREASINGLY LIKELY FOR STOCKING TO OCCUR OVER SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET. UNFORTUNATELY UNDER CURRENT LAW CONVICTED STALKER MAY GO UNPUNISHED FOR CONTACTING A SURVIVOR USING SOCIAL MEDIA OR THE INTERNET EVEN OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER IS IN PLACE AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR CLOSE LOOPHOLE BY ADDING CONTACT OVER SOCIAL MEDIA OR ELECTRONIC MEANS TO LIST OF PROHIBITED FORMS OF ACTIVITY.

MAKES IT A MISDEMEANOR FOR PERSON PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF STALKING TO WILLFULLY VIOLATE A COURT ORDER BY CONTACTING THE VICTIM BY TELEPHONE OR BY MAIL SB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR SIMPLY UPDATES A LOT TO KEEP UP WITH THE CURRENT CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. I DON'T SIDE THIS VERY COMMITTEE ROOM THERE IS AN EMPTY PHONE BILLS AND THAT ILLUSTRATES HOW OUR METHODS OF GENE COMMUNICATION. EXPANDED BEYOND THE TELEPHONE AND MAIL. MODERN FORMS OF COMMUNICATION INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION DEVICES AB SEVEN SIXTY FOUR DOES NOT CREATE A NEW CRIME THAT MILLION UPDATES EXISTING LAW TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE WAY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE AND WITH THAT WE BOURGEON I TOLD.

I'M NOT THE FORMAL CARE I COULD MOVE THE BILL COULD NOT HIRE NOTE I AM MODERATING NOW SO I HAVE TO WAIT SO WE CAN DESTROY MOTION. WHICH AGAIN WE CAN DO. WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK OKAY. I BELIEVE YOU'RE PRESENTING A SECOND BILL. HEY I AM AB WHAT WE'LL DO IS JUST OKAY HOLD ON THE MOTION FOR THIS ONE. AND ALLOW YOU 2% THE SECOND OKAY THANK YOU. AB NINE THIRTY NINE- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT- ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID ABOUT THIS. EVERY YEAR WE DRESSED IN JEANS TO PROTEST AN ITALIAN SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH HELD THAT THE SURVIVORS CLOTHING COULD BE USED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE. YET DESPITE A POP PROCLAMATIONS TO THE CONTRARY ARE EVIDENCE CODE LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN TO CONTINUE TO VICTIM BLAME IN A POLL THAT AN OUTFIT CAN GIVE CONSENT. UNDER CURRENT LAW SURVIVORS MANNER OF DRESS CAN BE ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN A CASE INVOLVING SEXUAL ASSAULT IF IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. THIS MEANS THAT THE JUDGE OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY MAKE A RULING ABOUT WHETHER TO ADMIT THE EVIDENCE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY MADE A DECISION TO EXCLUDE SOME FORMS OF EVENTS FROM BEING CONSIDERED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT INCLUDING DATING OR MARITAL RELATIONSHIP OR REQUEST OF THE PERPETRATOR HE'S A CONDOM OR BIRTH CONTROL DEVICE. SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THE MOST UNDER REPORTED AND UNDER PROSECUTED TYPE OF CRIME WE MUST MAKE SURE THE SURVIVORS ARE NOT RE VICTIMIZED AND RE TRAUMATIZED BY OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. CONTINUING TO ALLOW THE MANNER OF DRESS AS EVIDENCE FOR CONSENT IMPLIES A VICTIM'S PROVOKED THEIR OWN SEXUAL ASSAULT. IF OUR STATE LAW MAINTAINS THESE HARMFUL POLICIES IT IS ENABLING VIOLENCE SILENCING SURVIVORS REDUCING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. EIGHTY NINE THIRTY NINE FOR FILLS THE PREMISE OF DENIM DAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BY MAKING IT CLEAR THEY HAD A SURVIVOR'S MANNER OF DRESS CAN NEVER BE USED AS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT TO SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE BUT FLORIDA NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE ALREADY ENACTED LEGISLATION SIMILAR.

WELL THE VOTER. ECONOMIC BY. HOME ADULT WOMEN IN HOME LGBT. I A PLAY WE- WHEN ACTORS THEY'RE AWARE OKAY PATTERN LOADING OVER FIVE. LAYERED FOLDING INTO NOT BAY BREAK. BLACK RISK OF VIOLENT BIG THEY FROM WOMEN 90% MAKING SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE STATE BUT AS FAR. THE WAY SOMEONE IS DRESSED AS MAKES MORE LESS LIKE TO FOCUS ON CONSIDERING IN DOESN'T HAVE WAY OF THEIR BUSINESS PROVIDER RATHER THAN BELIEVING. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE MADE WEARING IS LOT OF IMPORTANT PIECE IN CONVENTIONAL. BY QUESTIONING WHETHER SURVIVORS WE ARE FINE THAT WOULD WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU TO WRITE TESTIMONY PLAY I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT WE'RE GOING TO YOU. INCLUDE YEAH PROBLEM A LOT. SOMEONE CAN BE NAKED IN SAY NO TO THAT SOMEONE CAN BEGIN HAVE SEX BY THEY KNOW WANT THAT ONE INCIDENT THANK YOU THE LOW. IF DID NOT GIVE. READ OF WHAT WEARING AND THEY BOTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK NOW WE'RE MORE TO A MAKE IN WARNER PLEASE ARE BOTH. YES THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MEGAN WARNER AND I LOOK CANDIDATE SEXUAL AT STANFORD BONTA RESURGENCE OF WITH THE CENTER INSTITUTIONAL COURAGE RESEARCH CENTER SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR INSTITUTION CAN FACILITATE JUSTICE. URGENTLY INSTITUTIONAL BETRAYAL NOT COURAGE IT'S FAR MORE COMMON. GOOD NUTRITIONAL BETRAYAL CCURS WHEN AN INSTITUTION HARM SOMEONE WHO DEPEND ON IT SOMETIMES WORKING POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS. BUT SOME REPORTS THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO AUTHORITIES THEY PLACE THEIR TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS THAT TOO OFTEN FAIL THEM. FOR EXAMPLE PLEASE MAKE BELT UNDERGO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BASED ON THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE SURVIVORS CREDIBILITY USING A NARAL AND OUTDATED UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. VERY FEW SURVIVORS WHO CASES GO TO TRIAL MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNNECESSARY AND HARMFUL QUESTIONING BASED ON OUTDATED BELIEFS ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. ONE SUCH BELIEVE INCLUDES THE IDEA THAT THE WAY SOMEONE IS DRESSED IS RELEVANT TO DETERMINING WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED. THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW SURVIVORS WERE ASKING FOR IT WITH THEIR CLOTHING CONTRIBUTE TO HELP PLANE. MUCH RESEARCH FINDS THAT SURVIVORS BLAME THEMSELVES FOR THE ASSAULT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY WERE DRINKING WHO THEY WERE WITH WHAT THEY WERE WEARING TO NAME A FEW. DON'T BLAME CONTRIBUTE TO GREATER ISOLATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS VIOLENT. PEOPLE WHO BLAME THEMSELVES ARE PULLING ON COMMON CULTURAL SCRIPT ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS REINFORCED. EXCUSE PERPETRATORS AND GOING BACK DOWN FOR THE VIOLENCE. WHEN THE COURT IS VICTIMS TIRE IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE IDEA BACK HELP HOMEOWNERS TRUST COULD BE EVIDENCE. THAT EVEN CONSIDERING WHETHER THEY'RE AT HIGHER IS QUOTE IN THE INTEREST OF JOBS THAT. INVOLVE UNNECESSARY AND HARMFUL QUESTIONING OF THE VICTIM. ALSO MISTRUST IF NOT BECAUSE OF THE FAULT AND IT'S TIME TO ALIGN OUR LAWS WITH OUR STATED GOAL OF SUPPORTING SURVIVORS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK IN FAVOR OF AB NINE THREE NINE. THANK YOU NOW WILL COME BACK TO FORTY TWO OLD THREE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE THREE NINE. C. NINE WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL. MISTER MODERATOR CAN WE GO TO OUR PHONE LINES AND SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE THREE NINE.

THIS IS LESLIE I'M PREPARED THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF THANK YOU. THERE THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES SOUND LIKE THE PRIMARY SUPPORT WITNESSES DON'T UNDERSTAND EXISTING LAW AB NINE THREE NINE IS UNNECESSARY AS APPLEGATE'S JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND WOULD PREVENT A FAIR TRIAL TO BOTH PROS PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE UNDER EXISTING LAW. EVIDENCE CODE SECTION. ELEVEN OH THREE SEVEN THREE SEVEN TWO- EVIDENCE OF THAT THE MANNER OF DRESS IS INADMISSIBLE UNLESS THE JUDGE FINDS THAT IT IS RELEVANT AND IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY THE JUDGE IS LISTENING TO BOTH PARTIES AS TO WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS. WHETHER IT'S AN DETERMINES WHETHER IT'S RELEVANT AND WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO ADMIT. THE JUDGE DECIDE STATING THEIR REASONS FOR THE RECORD. THIS IS A FAIR AND BALANCED PROCESS. THAT'S AB NINE THREE NINE IS NOT NECESSARY AB NINE THREE NINE AB AGAINST YOUR GEAR SO THIS QUESTION AND THE FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR CALIFORNIA JUDGES UNDER THE LAW WAVY OF THE DAM BALANCE THE COMPETING RIGHTS OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM AND THE DEFENDANT. OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS WE REPRESENTED MAN ACCUSED OF RAPE WHO REFUSED TO PAY IS THE GRADE AFTER THE FACT ONLY TWO DAYS. GREAT CHARGES RATHER THAN THEFT OF SERVICES. AND THAT IN A- SEX WORK SITUATION LIKE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE- YEAH NAKED WOMEN CAN BE GREAT HOWEVER I HAVE A CASE WHERE. THE COMPLAINING WITNESS WAS WEARING ONLY HIGH HEELS AND A G. STRING WALKING DOWN THE STREET KNOWN FOR SEX WORK ON MANY OCCASIONS. MY CLIENT WAS. CHARGED WITH RAPE AFTER REFUSING TO PAY IN DRUGS I WANTED TO PAY CASH INSTEAD. THE COMPLAINING WITNESS DEFINE DOES GIVE- DENIED. RESTITUTION MARC UNDER THESE AND MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION THAT THE EVIDENCE OF HOW A VICTIM WAS DRESSED MIGHT BE ESSENTIAL FOR A FAIR AND JUST TRIAL. BONTA MEDICALLY EXCLUDING SUCH EVIDENCE COULD DEPRIVE THE DEFENDANT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND CROSS EXAMINE FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOT TO THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON KATHY SURFER ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION WE RESPECTFULLY NOT SUPPOSED AB NINE THIRTY NINE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES IN EVERY CASE EVIDENCE THAT IS FOUND TO BE RELEVANT AND IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. AT LEAST CALDWELL HAS ALREADY DESCRIBED EXISTING LAW STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ENSURING THAT THE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE NOT BLAMED FOR THE CRIMES AGAINST THEM WHILE ALLOWING THOSE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME. YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY TO SEEK TO HAVE EVIDENCE OF MANNER OF DRESS CONSIDERED IN THOSE RARE CASES WHERE IT IS NECESSARY FOR JUSTICE PREVAIL. IT IS RARE FOR EITHER SIDE TO SEEK ADMISSION FOR THIS TYPE OF EVIDENCE AND RARER STILL FOR IT TO BE ADMITTED. WHERE JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOULD BE ADMITTED OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE SHOULD ALLOW THE JUDGE TO MAKE THAT CALL. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU. NOW WILL BRING HIM BACK TO ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE ARE THERE WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION TO. AB NINE THREE NINE. SHE NINE WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM AND THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL MODERATOR WE'LL GO TO OUR PHONE LINE TO SEE IF THERE ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB. NINE THREE NINE. YOU LIKE TO COME IN OPPOSITION OF AB NINE THREE NINE. PRESS ONE ZERO. FIRST WE'LL GO TO LINE THREE SEVENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. CANACCORD ARMAND THE HALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER IN OPPOSITION. I HAVE ONE MORE JUST A MOMENT. SHE. MEXICO TO LINE THREE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. DOES YOUR DEBATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- NOW LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS A RELIGIOUS AB NINE THREE NINE. SENATOR GRAHAM WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WAS JUST WONDERING IS MISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ I GUESS AND- IN LIEU OF THE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. DROVE IT HOME- IT DOES NOT MATTER IF A WOMAN IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN A G. STRING AND HIGH HEELS WITH A T. SHIRT THAT SAYS PLEASE RATE ME. THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE OF CONSENT. AND SO THERE IS NO SITUATION THAT I WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE TO COME UP WITH WHERE WHAT SOMEBODY IS WEARING IS EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IT IS TIME TO TAKE THAT OUT OF. THE DISCUSSION IT IS A BARRIER TO A WOMAN IF SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S GOING TO BE BLAMED OR THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME UP EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE JURY IS A BARRIER TO IT TO HER. OR HIM ASSERTING THE RIGHTS. AND SO I YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY I CAN'T BELIEVE IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IT IS A SUGGESTS THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOMEBODY IT'S EVIDENCE OF BEING A SEX WORKER I. I CAN'T EVEN WRAP MY ARMS AROUND WHAT WAS JUST SAT. IN IT SHOWS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THIS PROHIBITION. NO MAN OR WOMAN. SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR WHAT THEY WORE AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE EVER RELEVANT AS A MATTER OF CONSENT IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. SO MY FELLOW QUESTION IS THIS- THIS IS ONLY PERTAIN TO- RAPE CRIMES AND CRIMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR EXISTS FOR ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AT TWO SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES SEX CRIMES. YOU IN CRIMINAL CASES INVOLVING SEXUAL ASSAULT- THE MICHIGAN WHICH OF COURSE. NOT A QUESTION PER SE BUT I YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH WHETHER THIS REALLY DOES REDUCE JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS WE HAVE WHERE WE LITERALLY TAKE AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND WE JUST SAY. THE JUDGE MUST IF THEY DEFINE TEXAS CRIME THE MOST SENSITIVE CERTAIN WAY. AND I THINK THIS IS A BIT DIFFERENT I DO APPRECIATE. THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED THAT IT'S TAKING AWAY SOME FACTORS THE JUDGE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE HOWEVER WE KNOW JUDGES LIKE ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT BIASES. AND IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A BIAS THAT. THE PERSON IN QUESTIONS DRESS SOMEHOW PLAYED A FACTOR IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE CRIME AND SO. AND I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION BY THE PRESENTER THAT YOU KNOW THAT REALLY CANNOT MATTER AND I GUESS. WHILE I APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FACED WHEN DESCRIBING THAT CLIENT I THINK THE MORE RELEVANT WAS TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT THAT CLIENT. I WAS ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN A. FIVE IN A TRANSACTION WHERE THEN THE CHANGE B. B. R. DEMAND WAS CHANGED AS TO THE PAYMENT ON THE TRANSACTION- AND SO NOT KNOWING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT CASE I CAN'T IN ANY WAY SPEAK TO WHY OR WHY NOT IT WAS UNABLE TO BE DEFENDED AS A NON RATE. HOWEVER I THINK THAT AGAIN D. D. YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE SEX WORKERS WHO ARE NOT DRESSED IN A PROVOCATIVE MANNER SO IT SEEMED- AGAIN I CAN'T YOU KNOW USING EXAMPLE PROBABLY. IT WAS IT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADD CLARITY TO US IN TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE IT VERY WELL COULD BE THE CASE THAT THAT PARTICULAR SEX WORKER- WAS NOT RAPED AND SO THE PERSON THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER WAS DEFENDING YOU KNOW MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. GUILTY OF RAPE EVER THAT PARTICULAR YEAH I DESCRIPTION OF JUST THE CLONING SHOULD NOT REALLY BE A FACTOR SO. I THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CORRECT FOR THE VARIOUS BIASES THAT WE KNOW EXIST RACIAL BIAS SEES THESE GENDER BIAS SEES. AND SO. IT DID. YOU KNOW THIS ONE IS- IT COULD BE A GRAY AREA THOUGH I WOULD TRY HERE ON SAYING IT SHOULDN'T BE A FACTOR SO I'LL I THINK I MEAN I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THERE COME UNDER. HE I APPRECIATE NINE SENATOR SKINNER'S- COMMENTS YOU KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT. CASES THAT ARE NOT SO CUT AND DRY WHERE SOMEONE WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND THEN YOU KNOW. THE DEFENDANT YOU KNOW. KNOCK SOMEBODY IN THE HEAD AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTS THEM VERY RARELY ARE THE CASES THAT- THE SIMPLE. I'M WONDERING ABOUT CASES WHERE- THE- VICTIM WORD IS ALSO PART OF IT WERE ENGAGED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND WHERE THE MANNER OF THEIR DRESS OR WHAT THEY ARE WEARING- IT PLAYS A ROLE IN EITHER. WEAPONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE OR THAT ARE BEING CONDEMNING THERE LIKE ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS AND I'M JUST THINKING BACK TO THE NUMBER OF CASES AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT AND OFTEN TIMES AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS DO A DISSERVICE WHEN THEY COME BECAUSE THEY KIND OF SHARE VERY ON SIMPLE EXAMPLES- BUT OFTEN TIMES. THE NOT HOW PROVOCATIVE SOMEONE IS DRESSED BUT HOW THEY pARE DRESSED BUT MAYBE WHAT THEY ARE WEARING MAY PLAY A ROLE IN SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE CONCEALING MAYBE SOMETHING THAT SOME WEAPON THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE AND THAT DOES BECOME PART OF EVIDENCE AND THAT DOES BECOME PART OF- WHAT IS REVEALED. AND SHARED EITHER YOU KNOW DURING TRIAL OR OR WITH CHARGES AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT NGUYEN SOMETHING WHEN CLOTHING IS RELEVANT. TO THE CASE IN THAT WAY DOES THIS MAKE THAT INADMISSIBLE SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT SOMEONE WAS PROVOCATIVELY DRESSED BUT YOU KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE RAZOR BLADE OR WHATEVER. WHAT IS THE AND- YOU KNOW- SO THAT'S MY CAN AND I WANT TO AND I'M DON'T KNOW IF THIS ADDRESSES THOSE KINDS OF SCENARIOS. SO THAT WAS WHY I ACTUALLY ASKED M ORIGINAL QUESTION BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET AT IF THIS PREVENT CERTAIN EVIDENCE- FROM BEING ADMISSIBLE. SENATOR IF I MAY. THROUGH THE CHAIR AT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS THAT IT CANNOT BE USED FOR EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT NOT THAT IT CAN'T BE USED- FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE WHEN THAT TYPE OF THE TYPE OF SCENARIO YOU'RE GOING THRILLED WOULD. PROBABLY INVOLVE MORE THAN A RAPE HARGE IN OUR ASSAULT CHARGE RIGHT THERE'S OTHER THINGS GOING ON SO THIS PARTICULAR- PROHIBITION WOULD BE UTILIZING WHAT THE VICTIM WAS WEARING FOR EVIDENCE OF CONSENT. AND AGAIN I CHALLENGE ANYONE BECAUSE- LITERALLY YOU COULD WEAR A SHIRT THAT SAYS PLEASE WRITE ME AND THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE OF CONSENT SO I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T THINK. I LIVE RIGHT WHEN I SAW THIS I JUST WENT ROUND AND ROUND OF LIKE YOU PROBABLY ARE DOING LIKE WHAT IN WHAT WORLD. SHOULD THE JUDGE EVER. STATE OKAY IN THE INTEREST OF JUDGE OF. JUSTICE WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THIS IN THAT SHOWS YOU THE DANGER THAT THESE VICTIMS EVEN FACE COMING FOR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT SO. I JUST. FOR THE LIFE OF ME CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WHAT SOMEBODY WAS WEARING HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH CONSENT. I GUESS. THOSE ALONG. THE QUESTIONS ARE HERE TO THAT THIS BILL. DEALS STRICTLY WITH CONSENT- AND NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE TO I CAN. TELL YOU HAVE MANY SCENARIOS WORD DRESS WAS A FACTOR IN A CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED. TO LURE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE I I'VE WITNESSED IT YOU KNOW CHAU. I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN YOU CHOOSE AND YOU. MADE IT CLEAR YES IF YOU'RE WALKING ON THE STREET AND SAYS. NO PLEASE TICK THAT'S NOT. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I'M THE ENEMY DOESN'T GIVE JUSTIFICATION TO ANYTHING- YOU KNOW TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ANYBODY MALE OR WOMAN BUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT OTHER CRIMES ARE COULD BE COMMITTED BASED ON WHAT YOU LEARN IS NOT INCLUDED HERE AND WHAT WE'RE- DEALING WITH TODAY. YES AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL I HATE YOU KNOW THE YOU ALWAYS RUN INTO DANGER WHEN YOU'RE PRESENTING SOMEBODY ELSE'S BILL. I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTHOR AND IF IT NEEDS- AT IF THEY SHOULD GO OUT TODAY AND THEY NEEDS FURTHER CLARIFICATION TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS I'M SURE SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO WE GET THE LETTER. TO THE JOURNAL- COUNSELOR STATING THAT ARE. DESERVE SOME SAFEGUARDS THAT WE NEED TO. BE SURE THAT. I JUST QUESTION ON THE ARM CHAIR I DID SEE ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS IT DOES SAY THAT THE BILL RETAINS THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THIS EVIDENCE. ON IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BECAUSE I DON'T I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PENAL CODE IN RELATIONSHIP TO IT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IF THOSE PARTS THEY WERE REPAINTED ARE ADEQUATE. AND LIMIT AND THAT IT DOES DO THE LIMITING THAT EVERYONE'S DESCRIBING THAT WERE. IT THIS IS THIS IS EXPRESSLY ONE- ON THE CONSENSUS THAT'S EXPRESSLY ON THE ISSUE OF CONSENT SUCKER. SKINNER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YEAH IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IT IS RIGHT OKAY. SOON GONZALEZ FLETCHER LOOKED CLOSE M. I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO BELIEVE THIS WAS THE LAW BEFORE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT IT AS IF IT IS WE CELEBRATE DENIM DAY AS IF THAT IS THE LAW HERE AND IT IT I SHOULD BE WE YOU KNOW WE DO WANT JUDGES TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY- BUT THERE ARE INITIAL BIASES THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THRILLED AND I THINK- HOW IN PARTICULAR WOMEN DRESS COULD RESULT IN SOME OF SPICES IS I THINK WE HEARD IN THIS ROOM TODAY SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK CAN I PUT. WE WERE SEEKING A- ON A. B. THREE NINE. THREE I MEAN I'M SIX NINE THREE NINE I'M SORRY. I DO PASS ZERO EMOTION ON AB NINE THREE NINE.

WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR PRESENTING AB NINE THREE SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD 2% ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THREE SEVEN THE VISION ACT. WHICH WOULD PROTECT REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE FROM BEING FUNNELED INTO IMMIGRATION DETENTION BY CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL JAIL FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TIME EARNED PAROLE AND HAVE HAD THEIR SENTENCE COMMUTED BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER A CLOSE REVIEW OF THE CLEMENCY APPLICATION. WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ASSIST WITH TRANSFERS OF THESE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ICE THEY IGNORE THEIR RECORD OF REHABILITATION THEIR STABLE RE ENTRY PLANS AND THEIR NETWORK OF COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORT. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO HUMBLE TOWN JOAQUIN SANTA CRUZ CONTRA COSTA HAVE ALREADY RECOGNIZED THIS AND HAVE ENDED ALL TRANSFERS TO ICE. MEMBERS IF NOT FOR WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE BORN THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE MASS INCARCERATION. HOWEVER FOR IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE EARNED RELEASED THIS JUST MEANS THEY'RE GOING TO BE HANDED OVER TO ICE AND FACE PERMANENT SEPARATION FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES. LET ME BE CLEAR. CALIFORNIA IS UNDER NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO ASSIST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH DEPORTATIONS. THE BILL ALSO DOESN'T PRECLUDE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM RESPONDING TO A CRIMINAL WARRANT. OR PARTICIPATING IN JOINT TASK FORCES FOR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE TASK FORCE IS CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS NOT THEIR JOB. ON MARCH THIRTIETH A WOMAN FROM OMANI NAME GABBY SOLANO. WAS TRANSFERRED BY CDCR TO ICE. GETTY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AT AGE AT THE AGE OF TWO. AS A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT. GABBY IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR AND SPENT HALF HER LIFE BEHIND BARS FOR A CRIME. COMMITTED BY HER EX ABUSIVE PARTNER. AFTER SERVING TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTED HER SENTENCE IN RECOGNITION OF HER DEMONSTRATED RECORD OF COMMITMENT TO SERVICE. MENTORSHIP AND REHABILITATION. HOWEVER RATHER THAN ALLOW GABBY TO RETURN HOME TO HER FAMILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A PRIVATE COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH ICE PICKED HER UP FROM THE CDC OUR FACILITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TRANSPORTED HER TO A DETENTION CENTER IN COLORADO. ICE INCARCERATION WAS SO EXCRUCIATING BUT GABBY DECIDED TO SIGN HER OWN DEPORTATION ORDER RATHER THAN CONTINUE PURSUING HER LEGAL CASE MANY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE AN INTER MINUTE SENTENCE MEANING THAT THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER GOING THROUGH THE RIGOROUS PEARL PROCESS WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR CASE AND THE RECORD OF REHABILITATION ARE CLOSELY REVIEWED. IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAS SERVED OUT THEIR SENTENCES OR HAVE RECEIVED TO PAROLE SHOULD NOT FACE A SECOND PUNISHMENT WE SHOULD NOT FUNNEL THEM TO ICE DETENTION WERE SYSTEMATIC ABUSES IN INCOMING INTO MAIN CONDITIONS ARE VERY WELL DOCUMENTED. THE VISION ACT WILL END ICE TRANSFERS FROM OUR LOCAL JAILS AND CDCR A PRACTICE THAT TREATS PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON WHERE THEY WERE BORN.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY SOCIAL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AB NINE THIRTY SEVEN. AS WE STATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEBATE ABOUT SB FIFTY FOUR SHARES DO NOT UNDERTAKE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THAT SAID MANY COUNTIES MADE PUBLIC CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION ABOUT PERSONS DETAINED IN JAILS FOR SUMMER REASONS. ALSO STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MAY BE ASKED TO PROVIDE SAFETY BY OTHER AGENCIES. AB NINE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS. IF THE ACTION HAPPEN TO INCLUDE AN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE. ON THE PART OF THE OTHER AGENCY. FURTHER ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFENDERS PLACE OF BIRTH BE INCLUDED IN BASIC INFORMATION STORED IN STATE OR LOCAL CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WILL MAKE THAT INFORMATION LESS ACCURATE AND LESS USEFUL TO THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT RELY UPON THAT INFORMATION. ACTIVE OF WHETHER THE PERSON IS SUBJECT TO ANY IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTION. FOR THESE REASONS AND THOSE- PREVIOUSLY STATED CSSA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB NINE THREE SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THIS. MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION- IN OPPOSITION AS THE MEASURE OF BRIDGES SOME OF THE NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE THAT WE- WORK TO THE COMPROMISE INTO SB FIFTY FOUR AND THOSE REASONS WE ARE POSED IN ASKING ABOUT. THANK YOU. NOPE MOVING BACK TO THE KING ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE OTHER WITNESSES HERE AND OPPOSITION- AB NINE THREE SEVEN. C. NINE IN OUR OVERFLOW ROOM IN TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL MODERATOR. THERE ARE OTHER CALLERS IN Q. WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB NINE THREE SEVEN.IT WAS TESTIFYING OPPOSITION OF AB NINE THREE SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THE TIME. AND WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY THE COMMITTEE. CENTER TROUBLED I JUST HAVE A COUPLE STEPS- SOME COMMENTS ON THIS ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO. SOME OF YOU KNOW I'M A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS HANNAH ANDERSON FIRSTHAND AND I'M SENSITIVE TO THE STRUGGLES THAT IMMIGRANTS FACE. HOWEVER I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STATE HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE. SB FIFTY FOUR FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTY ALREADY PROHIBITED LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM COOPERATING WITH IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS WHEN IT CAME TO A LONG LIST OF OFFENSES. BUT EVEN THOSE WHO BROUGHT THAT BILL FORWARD ULTIMATELY UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN MORE HEINOUS OFFENSES THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COOPERATE WITH IMMIGRATIONS. OFFICIALS ON. THOSE ITEMS THAT WERE EXCLUDED FROM THAT BILL INCLUDED SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES. AMONG OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES. NOW WITH THIS BILL- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXTENDING THAT PROTECTION TO CASES THAT INVOLVE THINGS LIKE MURDER. FORCIBLE RAPE TORTURE HE CRIMES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ARE CRIMES AT THE STORE THE LIVES OF THEIR VICTIMS AND THOSE THAT LOVE THEM. IT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. IN ADDITION QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS IN REGARDS CENTER COMMON IN DO I WANNA. I THINK THE OTHER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. KERN SAID ASSEMBLY WOMAN. CARRILLO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MAY I ASK A QUESTION TO THE SENATOR. THE ISSUE WILL YOU TAKE A QUESTION SENATOR OTRO BOOK- HOPEFULLY I CAN ANSWER. DO YOU THE TEACHER THANK YOU DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WHO HAS. BEEN INCARCERATED WHO HAS SERVED THEIR TIME WHO HAS GONE BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD IN THE PAROLE BOARD SAYS. YES YOU ARE REHABILITATED TO RETURN TO YOUR HOME. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A PERSON THAT IS INCARCERATED HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHABILITATED. I'M NOT AN EXPERT AND NOT. IN THAT FIELD SITE I DON'T FEEL PREPARED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT- PERSONAL NOTE I WOULD HOPE. THAT THEY WOULD BE A AT THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK IT IT VARIES- AND SO FORTH BUT I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THAT FIELD SO I CAN'T SAY ONE WAYOR ANOTHER BUT PERSONALLY I WOULD HOPE. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AND I GUESS MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS. DO YOU BELIEVE THE PAROLE BOARD THE THIRD JOB ACCORDINGLY TO THE LAW TO BE ABLE TO SAY YES THIS PERSON AS WE HAVE ALLOCATED BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FACT THE EXPERTS. I WOULD HOPE SO BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE PAROLE BOARD IT DOES NOT CHANGE SENTENCING IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE INCARCERATION PROCESS IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE RESPONSIBILITY AN OBLIGATION OF THE PAROLE BOARD TO DO THEIR JOB ITSIMPLY SAYS IF YOU HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME. IF YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR TIME IF YOU GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD IN THE PAROLE BOARD TO YOUR POINT ARE THE EXPERTS AND THEY SAY YES YOU ARE REHABILITATED AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN A RIGHT TO RETURN HOME AND BE WITH YOUR FAMILY. IF THE ANSWER IS YES. AND THAT'S ALL WE NEED. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WERE BORN WHETHER YOU ARE A CITIZEN OR RESIDENT OR A TPS HOLDER OR UNDOCUMENTED. WE HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT UNFORTUNATELY. TREATS PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN DIFFERENTLY AND UNEQUAL. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. I'M NOT OKAY WITH CALIFORNIA CREATING A JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT TREATS PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. AND WHERE THEY WERE BORN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY I'LL JUST CLOSE FAR WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAKE YOUR CLOSE THANK YOU I WANT TO BRING INTO THE SPACE. THE INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAD BEEN DETAINED BY ICE AND ARE FACING DEPORTATION THE VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY WELL AND PERHAPS AFTER PTSD AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE CREATED A CRIME AND HAVE ALSO FACED ICE ATTENTION AND DEPORTATION. I WANT TO BRING INTO THE SPACE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY. AND THAT IS WHY THE VISION ACT IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE TO ENSURE. THAT JUSTICE PREVAILS AND THAT ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR WHERE THEY WERE BORN. ARE TREATED EQUALLY IN THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

AMONG- I SKINNER. MEASURE HAS THREE VOTERS. I WILL LEAVE ROQUE FOR APTIMA. NEXT UP HAVE. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE BY SENATOR ASSEMBLY LUMBERTON CRISTINA GARCIA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD REPEAL THE EXISTING SPOUSAL RAPE PROVISION IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND WILL PROVIDE EQUITY VICTIMIZATION NOT BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR MARCH STATUS KRYLOV MINIMIZES THE IMPACT OF RAPE AND HAVE HOUSE ON MARRIED INDIVIDUALS IN THIS BILL ALLOWS SIMILAR OUTCOMES FOR BOTH MARRIED AND UNMARRIED BIG BANDS THERE ARE NOW ONLY NINE STATES THAT DISTINGUISHED ALSO RAPE FROM NORTH SOUTH OF RAPE IN THE UNITED STATES. I AM I ENOUGH. IF AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT BY A STRANGER OR EVEN THEIR PARTNER WHICH WITH THEY HAVE FOUGHT FOR A YEARS LONG RELATIONSHIP THE ACT THIS DRAMATIC AND IS CARRIED ON FOR A LIFETIME IT'S NO DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE MADE BY SPELLS SPELLS EXPERIENCE RAPE EXPERIENCE RAPE SUFFER FROM LONG LASTING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE. A HANDFUL STUDIES HAVE FOUND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER FEAR ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SEXUAL FUNCTION TO BE CONSEQUENCES AMID A WAVE. OF MY CHOICE AND DOESN'T MAKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF RAPE ANY LESS SEVERE. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WAS SIMPLY FOR FIGHT PARITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IT WOULD REQUIRE THIS THING SANDERS A SELF RATE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PENAL CODE FOR NON SPOUSAL. RAPE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE TIME FRANCISCO DISTRIBUTORS THE ATTORNEY. SAYS THAT THE DEAN AND THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. FOR WOMEN HOLIKA SIEGEL. ESPECIALLY I VOTE. THANK YOU ARE. D. A. BUILDING. THANK YOU CHAIR BRADFORD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I ALSO WANT TO SPECIALLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA PROVIDING THE- SPEAK TODAY. ALSO SPECIAL THANKS ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND SENATOR CORTEZ BEFORE SERVING AS CHAMPIONS FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ROSTERING THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW. AS OUR COMMUNITIES CALL FOR RAISING VICTIMAS REVIVAL VOICES FOR HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE CALIFORNIA LAW CONTINUES TO PERPETUATE CENTURIES OLD INHUMAN IN IN AQABA PRACTICES THAT REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT A SPOUSE IS SEXUAL PROPERTY AND PROVIDE THEIR VOCAL CONSENT WHICH IS WRONG. IT MUST BE CORRECTED AND THIS LAW WOULD CORRECT IT AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE PROVIDES PARITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW IT WOULD REQUIRE THE SAME STANDARDS FOR SPOUSAL RAPE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PENAL CODE. FOR RAPE. RATED UNIVERSE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A CRIME OF VIOLENCE THAT IS BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARMFUL TO THE VICTIM. CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WORKING TO GET UNDER SPECIAL RAPE LAWS MAY FACE LESS SEVERE SENTENCING AND OTHER- SENTENCING REQUIREMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE EGAL RELATIONSHIP IN OTHER WORDS THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO GET MARRIED WHETHER BECAUSE OF CLASS SEXUAL ORIENTATION RELIGIOUS OBSTACLES OR WHATEVER ELSE. ARE DENIED THE PRIVILEGE AND- EQUAL TREATMENT. AS COMPARED. TO THOSE WHO ARE MARRIED. WHEN MERYL IS NOT TREATED AS SERIOUSLY AS OTHER FORMS ARE GREAT IT INVALIDATES THE VICTIMS PROMETIC EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE RAPE CULTURE. CRIMES INVOLVING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE HAVE A UNIQUE IMPACT ON SURVIVORS OFTEN LAYERED WITH EXTENSIVE TRAUMA RESPONSES THAT CAN LAST A LIFETIME. LONG LASTING IMPACTS OCCUR REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP STATUS. I'VE BEEN A SILENT WITH A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHETHER THEY HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE WHETHER THEY'RE ON A FIRST DATE WHETHER THEY'RE IN A NON- OUR LEGAL MARRIAGE AT ROCK- HABITATION WELL WHEN THEY ARE LEGALLY MARRIED. THE IMPACTS ARE- ALL THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE LONG LASTING NATURE OF THE HARM CAUSED MOREOVER A PERSON WHO COMMITS RAPE SHOULD NOT BE SHIELDED ACCOUNTABILITY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LEGALLY MARRIED TO THE VICTIM CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE COULD NOT PROVIDE FOR MORE LENIENT OR DESPERATE CRIMINAL LEGAL OUTCOMES. REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP GREAT IS GREAT. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE ELIMINATES THE DISTINCTION SO WE CAN ENSURE JUSTICE FOR ALL VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT REGARDLESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE TO THE PERSON WHO HARM THEM. SPECIFICALLY AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE REPEALS PENAL CODE SECTION TWO SIX TWO AND DELETE QUOTE NOT THE SPOUSE OF THE PERPETRATOR AND QUOTE FROM PEOPLE CODE SECTION TWO SIXTY ONE. WORDS FREE TRADE THAT'S GREAT THIS IS A PRACTICAL AND NECESSARY CHANGE IN THE LAW TO ADDRESS AN ARCHAIC PROVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. THAT DOES NOT PROTECT ALL SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THAT TREATS WOMEN AS THE PROPERTY OF THEIR SPOUSES. THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR MANY OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW IT WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PENAL CODE. IT WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT PROSECUTORS LIKE MYSELF WOULD HAVE TO MEET IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE SECURING A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE- MANY STATES THAT HAVE MADE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA REMAINS ONE. OF VERY VERY FEW. THAT FAILS TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION OR THAT THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION I SHOULD SAY BETWEEN SPOUSAL RAPE AND NON SPOUSAL RAPE. THEY COMMONSENSE REFORM CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF OUR VALUES- EIGHT REFORM THAT IS NECESSARY TO TREAT. ALL WOMEN EQUALLY AND TO CREATE ALL GREAT EQUALLY. THESE REASONS I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TO REPAIR AND INEXCUSABLE WRONG. THAT LANGUISHES IN OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AS A LEGACY THANK YOU THEY- BY LAW THEY ARE- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANKS WITH HIS. A SINGLE. GOOD EVENING- I WANT TO START BY THANKING EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEMBERS- INTO THE CHAIRS AND THE BRADFORD FOR GRANTING US IF HEARING ARE TO BE OUT THERE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA I WANT TO THANK HER AND DINNER OR GET ME AND ALL OF THE SENATORS THAT MYSELF AND DOCTOR DAWBER HAVE SPOKEN WITH OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY AND FOR TAKING UP THIS VERY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. MY NAME IS KANIKA SIEGEL AND I'M THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL DIVISION FOR WOMEN AND SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR CORE A SHE- BUT THE DEGREE CAL. NOW HAS BEEN AT THE FOR. OF THE SPELL THE RAPE ISSUE. SAID THAT EARLIER INTEGRATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. SO FOR US IT'S A LONG OVERDUE. THE RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE ONE SEVENTY ONE. A CALL FOR AN END TO THIS PROBLEM A BIG SECTION IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE HEARD THE STORIES FROM SURVIVORS THROUGHOUT OUR MEMBERSHIP ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I'M HERE TODAY IN GEAR SUPPORTING THEM. WE ARRIVED TODAY FOR THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF THE MARRIED WOMAN JUST AS WE WOULD IN SUPPORT OF THE SINGLE ONE OF THIS CRIME AND THE IMPACT ON THE SAME. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE SEE HERE IS THE ANTIQUATED THINKING SURROUNDING SEXUAL ASSAULT AN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. OUR COLLECTIVE IGNORANCE. AROUND HOW WE DEFINE AND YOU MAKE THEM AND THE DISREGARD FOR THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF CONSENT. I WANT TO ADD THE INABILITY TO JUST CALL A SPADE A SPADE. MY MESSAGE TODAY IS VERY SIMPLE THAT RAPE IS RAPE IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT WITH THE GRADE IF YOU'RE A WOMAN OF COLOR WE'VE BEEN RAISED IF YOU'RE A TRANS WOMAN WAIT FOR THE RAIN IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY AND RAPE IS RAPE. IF YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT. WE A CALIFORNIA NOW ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE WOMAN'S AND THE WHOLE. AND ACROSS THEIR INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES. WE ASK THAT YOU STAND WITH SURVIVORS AND WE CALL AN END TO THE SITUATIONAL SUPPORT THE VICTIM. AND AB ONE ONE SEVENTY ONE DOES JUST THAT AND IT WOULD PROVIDE A PARITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRED THE SAME STANDARDS FOR THE RAPE OF THE SPOUSE. THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PINOCHLE PENAL CODE FOR THE RAPE OF A NON SPOUSE. WE WERE CONVICTED UNDER SMALL THE RED LINE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY. FACE LESS SEVERE SEVENTEEN WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE FULL STOP. WHEN MARITAL RAPE IS NOT TREATED AS SERIOUSLY AS NON METAL MARITAL RAPE IT INVALIDATES THE DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE SURVIVORS WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU TO CONCLUDE. ONLY PLEASE. OKAY REVERSIONARY BE SHIELDED WHICH TRICKS VESSEL TREATMENT WITHIN THE MOBILE AND THAT INCLUDES BEING REQUIRED TO REJECT REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF SUCH A HEINOUS CRIME OF RAPE IS RAPE REGARDLESS IN AB ONE SEVENTY ONE ELIMINATES THAT DISTINCTION AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH.

SO WILL HAMPER THE JUDGE IN PUNISHING THE DEFENDANT THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE AND CONSIDERATION AND INPUT FROM THE VICTIM. ALTHOUGH RATED DIFFERENT WITHOUT THE RATE THERE'S A SEXUAL HISTORY AND INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS AT PLAY. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND VICTIM INPUT NECESSARY. AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WE'RE MAYES JUDICIAL DISCRETION WHEN REQUIRES CHRISTMAS IN FACT OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND ALL CASES HOWEVER ALL CASES MAY NOT WARRANT THAT SEVERE OF A PUNISHMENT. FAMILY AND CHILDREN MAY BE A PART OF THE SENTENCING TEAM CURRENTLY THE JUDGE HAS THE TOOLS TO FASHION A PUNISHMENT TO ALLOW FOR A CHANCE TO WORK FOR- FAMILY REUNIFICATION OR HAVING THE OFFENDER PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT THE GREAT FROM ONE. NOT EVERY CASE IS THE CLAIM. ACTUALLY DEALING CLIENTS FAMILY THAT. THE LEGISLATURE NOT BE THE JUDICIAL OFFICER WHO IS AND THE FACT THE VISION TO RENDER THE MOST APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT GIVEN ALL THE VARIABLES IN EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE. A. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE IS NOT THE ANSWER. WOW YEAH THANK. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IT. THANK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS THIS IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ALL THERE HAS BEEN DIALOGUE WITH THE OFFERING OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WE BELIEVE MORE TIME IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE BILL'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT SPELLS WILL RATE IS ALREADY A CRIME. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE TAKES DISCRETION FROM JUDGES DISMISSALS BUT DESIRES AND NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND STRIPS DEVELOPMENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED CALIFORNIANS FROM THE CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH THEIR SPOUSES. ON A PERSONAL NOTE AS THE RAPE SURVIVOR MYSELF AND THE MOTHER OF A RAPE SURVIVOR AS WELL AS THE CAREER LONG DISTANCE AND TURNING I CAN SAY WE ALL WANT TO EMIGRATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE SEX LIVES OF MEMORY DEVELOPMENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY DISABLED BROWSERS JIM FENDER PANEL CODE SECTION TWO SIXTY ONE SUB A SUB ONE THEY WOULD BE DEEMED INCAPABLE. OF CONSENTING TO SET. ALTHOUGH CPD UNDER THE DESIGN. TO RECOGNIZE THE TRAUMA DISPOSAL RATE AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY IN THAT IT TAKES AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND IMPOSES A ONE SIZE FITS ALL CENTERED. ON INDIVIDUALS BY TAKING AWAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION AB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE FORCES COURTS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE STATE PRISON EVEN IF THE VICTIM EXPLICITLY STATE THEY DO NOT NOT WANT PRESENT OR REGISTRATION BOTH OF WHICH TAKE AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO FIND OR KEEP EMPLOYMENT.

THIRTY ONE IN Q. THERE'S NO ONE IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS ARE CONCERNED CENTER PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA- I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- BEING THIS BILL FORWARD I- ACTUALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK ABOUT SEX- FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT AS A CULTURE WE- EXHIBIT INCREDIBLE SCHIZOPHRENIA- WHAT WE DO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IS INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ESPOUSE IN PUBLIC- AND WE ARE- INCREDIBLY PROVINCIAL- AS A- COUNTRY. WHEN IT COMES TO SEX BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE THE REAL DEAL- YOU HEAR STORIES AND- ABOUT THE BEHAVIORS AND PREFERENCES THAT ARE- VERY FAR FROM THAT. AND I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE MORE AND MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SEX- WE CAN ERASE THE- STIGMAS THEN WE HAVE PLACED ON IT. AND HOPEFULLY ENTER INTO A DISCUSSION THAT IS FAR MORE HONEST- THEN WHAT WE TRY TO PORTRAY- I THINK AS A RESULT OF THAT. SCHIZOPHRENIA WE HAVE CREATED A VERY BROKEN SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO OUR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY AND HOW THAT AND HOW SEX IS WEAPONIZED BY OUR D. A.'S. TOM OFTENTIMES AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY SEX IS TALK ABOUT SEX AND PEOPLE GET NERVOUS AND IT IS UNFAIR. BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT S REALLY REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME. AND I SAY THAT ALSO AS A SURVIVOR- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. NUMBER ONE IS DOES THIS BILL SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW CONSENTING ACTS. OF ROLE PLAY AND ROUGH PLAY THAT OFTEN TIMES CAN HAPPEN- BETWEEN CONSULTING CONSENTING- AND PROBABLY CONSULTING ADULTS WHO ARE MARRIED- BECAUSE I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT- EIGHT YOU KNOW IF THIS IS SILENT ON THAT AND THEN HOW THAT IS EITHER USED OR MISCONSTRUED OR MISUSED OR- BECAUSE I THINK CRIMINAL CHARGES OF ANY NATURE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE- YOU KNOW THOUGHT ABOUT VERY CAREFULLY. BEFORE LEVIED AGAINST SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE- TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- THOSE COULD COME INTO INTO PLAY- IF ALLEGATIONS OF- OF SPOUSAL RAPE- WERE LEVIED- PHIL LET ME START OFF BY- IF THE SPELL THE ROLE PLAY IS CONSENSUAL WHETHER YOU'RE MARRIED OR NOT. I WOULD SAY THAT. THAT'S NOT RAPE AND- WE HAVE A VERY DETAILED IN THE LAST QUESTION THAT I DON'T WANT TO SAY YES FOR SURE THIS ISWHAT THE BILL SAYS OR THE LAW THE PENAL CODE SECTION OF SPACE SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OUT OF PLACE IT WOULD BE MY ASSUMPTION BUT I'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. AND SO I DON'T KNOW OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT I HAD THE DAC ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU IN A BETTER WAY AND IF THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BY THE CHAIR YOURSELF FOR FINANCER. I DON'T SPEAK OUT OF PLACE- ARM. AGAIN OPEN TO. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN ASK MY SECOND QUESTION. OKAY AND THEN MAYBE. THE WITNESSES CAN- RESPOND TO BOTH OF THEM. SO I. AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHY DISABILITY RIGHTS HAS A NEUTRAL POSITION ON THIS. I WILL ALSO SHARE THAT- I AM THE- CO PARENT OF A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES AND I AM INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY- AND WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A COUPLE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE IN MY DISTRICT. AND I TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THIS BILL. AND- HAPPY TO REPORT THAT- OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS SEXUALLY ACTIVE AND THRIVING- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT OUR DOMINANT CULTURE HAS A VERY CONDESCENDING AND PATRONIZING- ATTITUDE TOWARDS OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY- ONE THAT IS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON. PROGRAMS DESIGNED AROUND SELF DETERMINATION SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FULLY EXPRESS WHO THEY ARE. AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THIS BILL SPELLS OUT WHAT LEGAL CONSENT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND THE REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE IN MY INTERACTIONS WITH MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER FOLKS- WHO ARE DISABLED- YOU KNOW FOLKS HAVE TICKS. FOLKS MAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOUNDS FOLKS HAVE THE REGULATED AND UNREGULATED BODIES. WINDOWS DON'T ALWAYS ALIGN WITH WHAT THE DOMINANT CULTURE CONSTRUES AS BEING NORMAL. AND SO IN THE HEIGHT OF A DISCUSSION AROUND FREE BRITNEY AND CONSERVATORSHIP AND SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEA OF WHAT NORMAL IS FOR A PARTICULAR PERSON. OR WHAT SORT OF. MENTAL ACUITY INSTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR FOLKS YOU KNOW IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY FOLKS WITH DOWN SYNDROME- AND SO I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT DOES THIS SPELL OUT WHAT LEGAL CONSENT LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM BECAUSE WHAT I SEE AND WHAT I HEAR. RIGHT WITH TWO CONSENTING WHO ARE ALSO WHO IN AND THE MANY INSTANCES SOMEONE WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME IS MARRIED TO SOMEONE WHO HAS DOWN SYNDROME NOT ALWAYS THESE ARE SOME GENERALIZATIONS BUT- I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I MAY SEE SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING AND SAY OH MY GOODNESS. THIS PERSON IS BEING RAPED. BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE IT'S JUST A SOUND THAT MAYBE I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH YOU KNOW WHAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN I'M HAVING SEX. SO I'M CURIOUS WHAT HOW THE WHAT THIS IS THE SILENT ON THAT OR ARE THERE SOME SPECIFICS ON THAT BECAUSE I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT US CRIMINALISING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND BEHAVIOR- BETWEEN FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK. WE I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO CREATE THE SPACE AND BE BETTER TOWARD DISABLED COMMUNITY X. X. I THINK WE IMPOSE NORMS ON FAIR THERE. AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE WILL AND ABILITY THE FREE WILL TO SAY YES AND ALSO TO STAY NOW- AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT OFTEN TEND TO MISCONSTRUE THAT AND WE- WE ARE NOT ALWAYS FOR IN THAT SPACE. IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COALITION- WE STARTED TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION OF A HIGHLY MAKE SURE THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY YES AND ABLE TO SAY NO. AND I WOULD SAY THAT AT THIS POINT THE BILL ISN'T CLEAR ON THAT SPACE AND AMENDMENT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY A COMMITTEE. AND IT IT DOES IT IT ALLOWS FOR YES BUT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR NOW. OUT THERE I WOULD SAY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT WHETHER IT'S- BEFORE THIS MOVES- TO OUT OF DISPENSED OR A NEW BILL MAKE SURE THAT'S IN THE COMMITMENT WITH THE DISABILITIES RIGHTS GROUPS. THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT I. BECAUSE THE AMENDMENT OFFERED ONLY ALLOWS FOR YES AN OFFER NO IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IT I'M WILLING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT'S HOW I NEED TO MOVE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. BUT EITHER WAY MY COMMITMENT IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ALLOW FLEXIBLE SAY YES AND I'LL ND IN A WAY WHAT THE DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS ARE ABLE TO COME IN AND HELP DEFINE WHAT THAT IS. AND THE ANSWER HAS BEEN THAT AT THIS POINT THEY HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME. TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEY HAVE ASKED FOR MORE. TIME UNTIL I THINK THE INITIALS ASIAN FROM MY AND THEIR- THIS. WHETHER IT'S THE BILL OR THE BILL WITH THE M. WAS HAVE THAT WORK TO DO AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK. WITH THEM- BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY BOTH YES AND I'LL- SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT- I DON'T WANT TO GET EMOTIONAL BUT I HAVE BEEN TO SO MANY. MEETINGS AT MY REGIONAL CENTER WHERE- FOLKS TO LABEL WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING PART OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY ARE FIGHTING THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR SELF DETERMINATION. AND SO MANY TIMES IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THEY ARE MET WITH RESISTANCE FROM A DOMINANT SOCIETY THAT IS PROJECTING NORMS ONTO THEM WITH OUT THEIR INPUT AND WITHOUT. FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE AND THE VIBRANCY AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS COMMUNITY AND WE SHUT THEM DOWN WE SHUT THEM DOWN WHEN THEY'RE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT WE SHUT THEM DOWN WHEN THEY ARE ASKING TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN WE SHUT THEM DOWN WHEN THEY'RE ASKING OR LOOKING TO BE INVOLVED IN. ADULT RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THERE'S THIS PAROCHIAL. PATRONIZING ASSUMPTION. THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT US. OVERSEEING HOW THEY LIVE AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT- AND I EXPERIENCE OUT EVERY DAY IN MY OWN HOUSEHOLD HAVING TO. RE LEARN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT TICKS AND TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS MEAN TO SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE SPECTRUM AND NOT IN WORKING TO NOT IMPOSE MY RATIONALE OF WHAT IS NORMAL AND WHAT IS OKAY AND SO. VERY RARELY DO WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IN ANY OF THESE CHAMBERS- AND SO I'M I'M- REALLY ASKING THAT YOU CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE- AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RATE BUT IT IS ABOUT SEX. AND THEY DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT SEX IS FOR THEM. I TOTALLY GET WHEN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS NOT DISABLED IMPOSING I MEAN I AM I MEAN I KNOW WHAT RAPE IS. AND THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT THESE NEW ONES SEASON NUANCES AND CREVICES THAT GENERALLY DON'T GET THE LIGHT WHICH IS WHY I DO APPRECIATE THIS BILL. COMING FORWARD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT VERY OFTEN SO I AM ASKING THAT YOU CONTINUE TO. WE ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH ARM. THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON. THAN BECAUSE THIS SENATOR HAS A CHILD. WHO DESERVES TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WHEN DISCUSSING HOW HE- IS ABLE TO LIVE AND I WOULD SAY- I THINK WE ALL MAYBE NEED TO GET A LITTLE MORE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS THAT TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND WE DO NEED TO HAVE THIS IS THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THIS AFFECTS OUT THERE- I AGREE THAT WE MUST UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS TRUE AND- I SURE WOULD DO THE FRUSTRATIONS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS WITH OUR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND- THERE HAS TO BE A SPACE FOR MYSELF DETERMINATION AND THAT SPACE I FULLY BELIEVE IN THAT. I THINK IN GENERAL- TAKING THIS ATTITUDE OF PUTTING PEOPLE AWAY AND HIDING THEM IN AND NOT ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION OVER TO BE FAIR- TO ALL INDIVIDUALS TO BE INCLUSIVE TELEVISION COMPLETED ADDING CIRCLE HERE I AM VERY COMMITTED TO THAT DISCUSSION WHETHER IT'S A DISCUSSION BEFORE THIS BILL IF I EVER GET TO THE GOVERNOR THIS YEAR OR A NEW BILL NEXT CHECK ME THAT COME IN THAT COMMITMENT TO- THE DISABILITY GROUPS US THAT WHATEVER WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LESSONS THEY BOTH YES. AND NO- AND IT'S FAIR THAT WE HAVE IN FIGURE THAT OUT AT THIS POINT AND THE LAST THE IN MY DISCUSSION THE SAID WE'RE OKAY WITH THIS BILL MOVING WITH THAT WHAT THE COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FOR THIS TO BUY THEIR TEN AMENDMENT DOWN THE ROAD ARE YOU BILL MAKE SURE SPECIFIC TO THE SPACE I AM VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO THAT- AND THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR NINE YEARS AND I THINK WHEN I SOME COMMITTED SOMETHING I WORK ON IT FOR YEARS ON END UNTIL IT GETS DONE RIGHT I'M NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT COMMITMENT. BUT I ALSO FEEL IT'S A HAVE TO DO IT ON HUNDRED TERMS AND NOT MY TERMS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE NEUTRAL POSITIONS COMING FROM FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM UP UNTIL THIS MORNING OUT THERE INTO MY COMMITMENT IS GENUINE I DON'T PRETEND TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND ALL THE ANSWERS OTHER THAN THAT I DO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND ALLOWING SELF DETERMINATION FOR INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AND SO- WHATEVER THE DISABILITY IS THIS I MEAN THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HIMSELF WITH TERMINATION OFTEN. SO I DO APPRECIATE YOU SHOW YOUR PERSONAL STORY WE US- AND- I HOPE. IN MY LIFETIME MY TEN YEAR NOT MY- BECAUSE FIGURE OUT A BETTER SPACE AND IS NOT JUST. ON ISSUES OF SEX BUT JUST IN GENERAL- HOW WE TREAT THIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THAT SPACE. THIS IS DIFFICULT VERY CAPABLE GAIN IF I COULD BRIEFLY RESPOND TO THE VERY IMPORTANT AND PERSONAL- QUESTIONS AND STORIES THAT THAT CENTER CAMARGO SHARED- BECAUSE I THINK SHE REYES REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEM THANK HER. AS WELL FOR SHARING AND HER CONTRIBUTION ON THESE ISSUES- AND ALSO EXPRESSED BY COMMITMENT TO SELF DETERMINATION I HAVE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS AND STAFF MEMBERS IN MY OFFICE AS WELL WHO ARE DISABLED- AND I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT IS. AS YOU SAY OFTEN OVERLOOKED GETTING EXCLUDED FROM THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SEXUAL IDENTITY AND SEXUAL CONSENT AND BEYOND- I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR AND TRY TO FOCUS ON WHY HE IS THE REAL QUESTION WHEN IT COMES TO- THIS ASSMBLY BILL. THIS IS NOT AN ASSEMBLY BILL THAT OULD IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR WHAT PROSECUTORS IN A COURT OF LAW HAVE TO PROVE. TO SECURE A CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR RAPE IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. AND IT WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY ALTER. OR ELIMINATE. A VERY LONGSTANDING WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL DEFENSE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE MAYBERRY THANKS TO THE FENCE WHICH- ESSENTIALLY- REQUIRES PROSECUTORS. TO ELIMINATE THE REASONABLE POSSIBILITY. THAT THE PERSON ACCUSED THOUGHT. THE VICTIM CONSENTED. IT IS OUR BURDEN AS PROSECUTORS IN EVERY SINGLE CASE WITH OR WITHOUT THIS CHANGE IN A LONG. TO ESTABLISH BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THERE WAS NO CONSENT AND THAT THE PERSON ACCUSED COULD NOT HAVE REASONABLY BELIEVED THERE WAS CONSENT. MEETING THAT BURDEN IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT THANKS MANY ARGUE MANY BELIEVE IT'S TOO DIFFICULT AND THAT'S WHY SO MUCH SEXUAL ASSAULT GOES ON PUNISHED BUT WHAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE IS IT IS UNIQUELY DIFFICULT IN CASES. WHERE BOTH PEOPLE ENGAGING IN SEX ACTS ARE DISABLED ESTABLISHING. A JURY THAT. BACKS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NON CONSENSUAL AND ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL IS OFTEN AN INSURMOUNTABLE BURDEN THIS LAW WOULD NOT THIS PROPOSAL THIS ASSEMBLY BILL WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THAT LOFTY BURDEN SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT DO I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH SENATOR TOM LONGER AND THE SENATE IN GENERAL ON. HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BRING IT OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INCLUDING- DISABLED MEMBERS OUR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH YOU TO THE TABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FOR THIS CORRECT. WELL I I'D- M. THE THANKFUL AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND FULL DISCLOSURE THAT I ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE DA OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THIS BILL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT RENEGADES THE ABILITY FOR CALM. FOLKS WITH DIFF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FROM CONSENTING AND SO MY CONCERN IS IT TOO LATE WHERE ESPOUSES INCAPABLE OF GIVING LEGAL CONSENT DUE TO A DISABILITY DO YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT THE STANDARD IS SO BECAUSE- ONCE AGAIN IN MANY INSTANCES. THE COUPLE BOTH OF THEM. CAN HAVE IF THEY BOTH HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT. SENATOR THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT IN ANY CRIMINAL CASE CERTAINLY INCLUDING THESE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS THE BURDEN OF THE PROSECUTOR THE BURDEN OF FOR EXAMPLE THE LAWYERS MY OFFICE OR ANY OTHER DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN FILING A CRIMINAL CASE IT IS OUR BURDEN TO ESTABLISH EACH AND EVERY ELEMENT OF. THE PARTICULAR CRIME CHARGED BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPE FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE OUR BURDEN TO PROVE THE TEXAS COURT IT WILL BE OUR BURDEN OF PROOF TO PROVE THAT THE SEX WAS NON CONSENSUAL IT WILL BE OUR BURDEN TO PROVE. THAT NOT ONLY WAS NON CONSENSUAL SEX BUT THAT THE PERSON ACCUSED COULD NOT HAVE REASONABLY BELIEVES. THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL SEX. IN MANY INSTANCES EVEN IF THERE'S A CONSERVATORSHIP IN PLACE FOR ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE THE VERY DIFFICULT OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN AS PROSECUTORS IF WE CHOOSE TO FILE RAPE CHARGES. OTHER SALVAGING THAT A PERSON EVEN A PERSON WAS SEVERE DISABILITIES COULD NOT HAVE REASONABLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT THE PERSON THEY HAD SEX WITH- WHO WAS CONTENT. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THE REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ALLEGED VICTIM COULD HAVE BEEN. IN CENTER. A DIFFICULT BURDEN IT'S ACTUALLY MORE DIFFICULT IN CASES WHERE DISABILITIES ARE INVOLVED NOT BECAUSE WE UNDERMINE THE SEXUAL IDENTITY OR SEXUAL AUTONOMY OF DISABLED PEOPLE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE DO AS A SOCIETY BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THIS LEGAL REFORM LEGAL REFORM IS REALLY JUST LOOKING AT. WHETHER RAPE IS RAPE IT DOESN'T. THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR PROVING IT IF IT'S IF IT'S A LEAD. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO ALLEGED CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF RESPONSE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN RATE. CAN BE PROVED IT. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS FAR FAR FAR MORE OFTEN. THAT IT CAN BE PROVEN BY PROSECUTORS. WELL NO I THINK YOU FOR THAT BUT I WE WERE TALKING I WAS THINKING BACK TO A CASE THAT WAS- TRIED IN MY COUNTY- FROM- A FORMER DA- AND- THE PERSON THE YOUNG MAN DID HAVE A DEBOUT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND WAS CHARGED WITH RAPE AND HE THEN THAT WAS NOT WHAT HAPPENED- AND IN FACT THE- THE PROSECUTION SAID. WE KNOW HE DOESN'T NEED JAIL- BECAUSE WE KNOW HE HAS A MENTAL- DISABILITY- BUT WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE HIM ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS IS AN EASY WIN. ARM AND SO I E. II DO WHAT AID YOU KNOW I DID IT SO I MEAN THAT'S JUST THAT'S THE REAL STORY SO I'M AS AND I WOULD HATE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO BE PREDICATED ON WHO THE D. EIGHT IS- BECAUSE AND WE'RE PUTTING OUR EGGS YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY IN YOUR BASKET IN IN A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S BASKETS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN. THERE ARE AND I APPRECIATE THAT BATES SENATOR AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THIS LAW WOULD CHANGE THE STORY THAT YOU DESCRIBE. I MEAN IF THEY WERE LEGALLY MARRIED. OUR GALLAGHER WE'RE GOOD AT MAYBE IT WOULD BE. WELL I THINK HI G. OF COURSE ON THE CENTER. TROUBLE CONDUCTOR CENTER SKINNER. OKAY RIGHT WILL LOOK LET ME LET ME GO ON RECORD I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THEY ARE AMENDMENTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PUT FORTH AND I WILL CLEARLY STATE ON BECAUSE THE AMENDMENT DEFINITELY SPEAK TO THE BILITY OF DISABLED PEOPLE TO SAY YES AND TO SIGNAL AND CONSENTING TO EIGHTY SIX AND AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE BILL THAT THE BILL WOULD CRIMINALIZE WILL FULL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN MARRIED COUPLES OR ONE OR BOTH. ARE DISABLED. THE BILL WHICH DEAL TOTALLY DELETE AND LET ME STATE AGAIN TOTALLY THE LEAKED AND PARTY. OF SECTION CODE I MEAN SECTION- WHAT I TO SAY SECTION. STE. TWO SIX TWO. WHICH WOULD REMOVE SPOUSAL RAPE AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO REMOVE THAT COLD AND EVERYONE HERE SUPPORTS THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THIS. BILL AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE- THE MEMBERS SHOULD NOT ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WE'RE NOT HERE TO SAY THAT IT DOES BUT THIS BILL REMOVES DISCRETION OF JUDGES TO GRANT PROBATION OR TO NOT REQUIRE MANDATORY LIFETIME SEX REGISTRATION AND AGAIN IT'S NOT A SINGLE PERSON HERE WHO CONDONES RAPE- I HOPE IT'S NO ONE IN THIS BUILDING AND I'LL NO ONE ANYWHERE AROUND HERE WOULD DO THAT BUT I THINK THE- BILL ALSO A SILENT ON THE FACT THAT. MEN ARE REAP TO. AND ALL THE TESTIMONY ONLY SPEAKS TO WOMEN BEING RAPED AND MEN ARE BEING RAPED EVERY DAY. IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT SPEAKS NOTHING THIS AWARD IS A STAND AS IT RELATES TO MEN BEING HURT. A CASE LET MYSELF WITH. MEN ARE DEFINITELY RATES AS WELL IT'S THIS IS AN THE GENDER DOESN'T MATTER AND IT'S ABOUT POWER OUR NEXT. AND SO IT'S NOT MY INTENT TO THAT ONLY A IT'S ONLY IF YOU KNOW FOR WOMEN I THINK IT SPEAKS BILL OR THE GENDER ROLLED IN THE PAR THEN I MIX THAT WE'RE WORKING TO BRING PARITY. TO AND THE WORDS THAT WE USE THAT TIME SO I WOULD START WITH THAT PIECE THE SECOND PIECE I WOULD SAY WITH THE AMENDMENT. THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED I THINK IT DEFINITELY ALLOWS FOR YES- AND A SEARCH TO ADDRESS HALF OF THE ISSUE AND PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BUT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR NOW YES HE DOES. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO DISAGREE ON THAT IT DEFINITELY LAWS FOR NOW. IT'S A- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND TALKING TO FOLKS AND IN TALKING TO THE DISABILITIES GROUPS THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR NOEL. LET THE COUNCIL TWENTY. IT WOULD STILL ALLOW FOR SOMEONE TO BE RAPED SO JUST SO IF THE MAN IT MAKES IT SO THAT A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES IS NOT PRESUME TO NOT BE ABLE TO CONSENT WITHIN A MARRIAGE WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT MAKES IT STATUTORILY JUST AS WE SAY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T CONSENT. UNLESS THEY'RE MARRIED. IF THEY'RE MARRIED THEY CAN. BUT IT DOES IT DOES NOT CHANGE RATE A PERSON CAN STILL BE CHARGED WITH RAPE IF THE IF THE IF THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY SAYS. I DIDN'T CONSENT I A T. ATTACKED ME THIS OR ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS IF THE PERSON IS DISABILITY SAYS I DIDN'T CONSENT IT'S STILL GREAT EVEN UNDER THE AMENDMENT WHAT THE SOME BUT WHAT YOUR BILL CURRENTLY SAYS THE PERSON WITH DISABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED TO CONSENT EVEN IN THE PICTURE OF MARCH. AND SO THIS JUST REMAINS REMOVES FAT JUST AS A FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CANNOT CONSENT BUT IF THEY'RE MARRIED LAW RECOGNIZES. THEM IN MARRIAGE AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CONSENT. BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY THEY GET MARRIED SO THIS IS THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS REMOVE. THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EVEN WITHIN MARRIAGE CANNOT CONSENT IF THE PERSON SAYS MY HUSBAND RAPED ME. THEY CAN STILL BE CHARGED WITH RAPE JUST LIKE THEY CAN UNDER EXISTING LAW. SO IT JUST SAYS IT JUST TAKES AWAY THE PRESUMPTION THAT THERE IS NOT CONSENT. I WOULD SAY THAT IN MY DISCUSSIONS UP UNTIL THIS MORNING INCLUDING LIKE THE DISABILITY RIGHTS ATTORNEYS THAT. THEY FEEL THAT IT DOES ADDRESS THE OF THE YES SIDE OF THE EQUATION BUT NOT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHY THEY'VE ASKED FOR MORE TIME GIVE US FOR THERE TO BE A DISCUSSION THAT'S- YOU KNOW SPECIFIC HERE AND AN ADDITIONAL BILL TO TRY TO ADDRESS. THOSE ISSUES- I AM FULLY COMMITTED. TO GETTING IT RIGHT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND- AT ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING A BETTER SYSTEM THERE ARE AND I HAD IF THE AMENDMENT TO SET THOSE WITH US I AM WILLING TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENTS- IN IF IT DOESN'T I WANTED TO FIND A SOLUTION WHETHER IT'S AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DISABILITY RIGHTS STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH BUT THAT THAT'S IT IT DOES TAKE IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH. GREAT IT JUST DEALS WITH THE IT JUST TAKES OUT THE OF THE STATEMENT IN YOUR BILL THAT SAYS A PERSON WITH DISABILITY IS NOT CAPABLE OF CONSENT. SO THIS A PERSON CAN. THAT IT DOES THAT HAVE TO BE CAPABLE TO. I'M SORRY I JUST I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PRESUMPTION IN THE LAW THE DISABLED PEOPLE CANNOT CONSENT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IF I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THAT THAT IS WHAT THAT ARE. KERN SO I HAVE NOT MADE ANY HEADWAY WITH IT IS IN THE LAW STATES THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN. IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY EXACTLY ALL RIGHT WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BACK AND FORTH WITH WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO UNDERSTANDING THAT. AGAIN MY COMMITMENT IS THAT IF THAT IS. THAT IT GIVE IF THE AMENDMENT. ALLOWS FOR YES AND NO. IT DOES AND- IT'S FAIR AT THIS POINT THAT'S NOT MY YOU'RE TAKING THE MOMENTUM. IF IT'S FROM MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS. RUPE IT'S NOT CLEAR TO THEM THAT THIS AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR SNL WE'VE TALKED TO WILL WE MUST B TALKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS BECAUSE DISABILITY GROUPS SO WE'VE TALKED TO ARM APPROVED THIS LANGUAGE SO MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE DISABILITY RIGHT COMMUNITY BUT I THINK WE'VE CRAFTED AN AMENDMENT THAT ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL IT'S- I THINK IT'S NOT NOT A MORE VILE DISGUSTING ACT. THAT YOU CAN COMMIT ON SOMEBODY RATE ABSENT MURDER ANYWAYS RAPE IS WORSE TO MURDER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT TRAUMA FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND I HAVE. GIRLFRIEND EX GIRLFRIEND IN COLLEGE WHO WAS RAPED BY KNOW THE TORMENT THAT IT PUT ON HER AND SHE STILL SUFFERS FROM THAT. TODAY BUT I ALSO HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE DISABLED AND HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE DISABLED COURT IN LOVING CARING RELATIONSHIPS AND I'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS OF THEM INTERACTING. AND LEGACY IT'S NOT ARE TRADITIONALLY INTERACTION BUT- THEY COMMUNICATE. AND LOVE IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM EACH AND WHAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO DENY THEM. THAT OPPORTUNITY AGAIN WE'RE HERE TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOAL OF. ELIMINATING SPOUSAL RAPE WHICH YOU CAN'T RAPE IS RAPE. NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT BUT I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF CONSIDERATION AND- WHO. CONSIDER THAT WHICH DISABLED COMMUNITY HAS TO DEAL WITH AND I THINK THIS AMENDMENT GIVES YOU TO. GIVE US JUST THAT AND GIVE YOU THE BILL THAT YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. SKINNER APOLOGIES THAT I WASN'T HERE FOR THE WHOLE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A BUDET BRIEFING AT TIMING IS TERRIBLE THE WHAT. I OBVIOUSLY WAS HERE FOR MOST THE COMMITTEE UP UNTIL THAT POINT- I WONDER DID ANY OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS GROUPS TESTIFY HAVE WE HEARD FROM THEM DIRECTLY AND I DON'T MEAN YOU OF COURSE HAVE TO COMMIT BUT DID. WAS THERE ANY TESTIMONY PRESENTED IN. I THINK ONE STATED THEY WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AS OF TODAY. YES THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME A SLIGHT PAUSE. BY COMPLETELY APPRECIATE. SHARE WHAT YOU AND STAFFORD TRYING TO DO HERE I ALSO HEAR. THAT OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS THAT WHAT ONE MAN PUBLIC DEFENDERS SAYING THAT- DA SAYING THAT THAT- WHATEVER THE BILL DOESN'T HOWEVER WE HAVE ANOTHER THE CHECK SO I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT IN FACT. THE WAY THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED NOW IS HAS A FLAW IN THAT WE HAVE TO FIX THE FLAW SO AND I'VE HEARD DOCTORS SAY SHE'S ALSO WILLING TO FIX THE FLAW. NO I ALSO KNOWN AS BEING THE FORMER CHAIR FOLK SAFETY THAT OUR STAFF ARE REALLY GOOD. BUT OF COURSE WE ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO FIX A FLAW FOR A SPECIFIC COMMUNITY WHICH IS THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE. ALSO COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHICH WAY WE WERE SORRY WITH THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED- I KNOW THAT'S HARD THIS OUR LAST DAY HAVE COMMITTEE AND SUCH- BUT WE- COULD BE BE WILLING MEAN SHE'S COMMITTED TO TAKING THE AMENDMENT. BUT CAN WE GET A- CAN WE GET SOME INFORMATION FROM THE PRIMARY THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COALITION THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT. YES MEANING THAT IT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW ACHIEVES THE SAME OBJECTIVE THAT THE COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE IT HERE TODAY AND- IF GOING FORWARD THEY HAVE THE- PROBLEM WITH THE MOMENT THAT WE PUT FORTH THEN WE CAN ADDRESS A GOING FORWARD BUT- TO TAKE IT HERE TODAY TO. GET MY SUPPORT AND AN ADDRESS IT IN AND LEAVE THE- ROOM OPEN TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT IF. THEY COME BACK WITH OPPOSITION WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ADDRESS AT THE- AT THANK YOU CHAIR I THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME GOAL ONSELEN OF THE STATE THAT FOR THE RECORD I THINK ON THE SAME TEAM. HERE AND SO- WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL AND I THINK. ASKING ME TO TAKE A MOMENT AND OF THIS THE COMMUNITY HAS AN ISSUE WITH THAT TO COME BACK AND ADDRESS IT LOOKS I THINK THIS RIGHT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE LEAVING OUT. THE DOOR OPEN FOR US I WOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT AND SO I I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TODAY- AND ADDRESSING IT AT THE END THE DAY I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE OR DISABILITY. STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WHEREVER WE LAND AND IS. AN AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A REALIZATION AND BEING ME OVER HERE IS SAYING THAT THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT RIGHT AND SO VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO THE TO THAT WORK AND I IS ON THE FOR ME THAT- WE ARE GOING TO KEEP WORKING. TOGETHER AND IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS WE WILL ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND IF NOT WE WILL WE WILL LET IT BE THE BUT THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE STAFF YOURSELF IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE PUTTING INTO THIS OTHER WAY TRYING TO GET IT BUT I DO. FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE HERETHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING THAT BETTER FOR DISABILITIES COMMUNITY. YES THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY.

YEAH IT WAS A- BKD AMENDMENTS TO CHANGE THE BILL'S REPORTING DATE TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT WE CAN GET A REPORT BACK. REALLY BEFORE THE PILOT SUNSETS ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT LOOKS AT AN EXISTING. PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS AUTHORIZED LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED IN SIX COUNTIES ALAMEDA BUTTE NAPA. NEVADA SANTA CLARA AND VENTURA. AND IT ALLOWS ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE. TO VOLUNTARILY OPT INTO PROGRAMS THAT ARE AGE APPROPRIATE SO THAT THEY ARE SERVED IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO THE ADULT FACILITY. INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE PILOT IS WORKING HOWEVER. BECAUSE OF COVERED IN SOME OTHER RESTRICTIONS WE JUST NEED TO EXTEND THE SUNSET A LITTLE BIT LONGER I SUPPOSE SURE THAT WE GET APPROPRIATE REPORTS BACK. THAT IS WHAT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN DOES IS EXTEND THE SUNSET AND CLEAN UP THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIMING OF GETTING REPORT BACK. WITH ME I HAVE DANIEL SANTOS OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU. WE CAN START WITH YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS- DANIEL CENTERS.

I THINK THAT'S FULLY ON THE PATHWAY THEN IN TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE SYSTEM I'M AS STATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE THIS WOULD EXTEND THE CURRENT SENSE THAT FOR TWO YEARS WHICH WE BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT- IN PROGRAM CONTINUITY I WOULD JUST BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT A FEW IMPORTANT FACTORS OF THE PROGRAM IT BRIDGES THE NEEDS AND PROGRAMMING SPECIFIC TO YOUNG ADULTS THAT THE JUVENILE SYSTEM PROVIDES WITH THE- GOAL OF HELPING TRANSITION THESE YOUNG ADULTS PERMANENTLY OUT OF THE SYSTEM. IT REQUIRES THE INDIVIDUALS AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IT'S BASED ON A LOCAL MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM APPROACH TO ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM AND DISCUSS OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM THE INDIVIDUAL HAD THEIR CHARGES DISMISSED AND THE RECORD CLEARED AND IT REQUIRES RE ENTRY PLANNING AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF EDUCATION HOUSING AND RELATED SUPPORT. SO WE SEE THIS AS AN IMPORTANT- EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET ON- TO CONTINUE CONTINUITY IN PROGRAMMING FOR THESE YOUNG ADULTS AND WE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS ARE LOW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY NINE NINETY WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS IT RELATES TO COUNTY JAIL VISITATION. SHERIFF'S UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF VISITATION FOR INCARCERATED PERSONS AND THEIR VISITORS BUT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR MANDATING VISITATION AT THE EXPENSE OF SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. BY LIMITING THE ABILITY TO SUSPEND VISITATION TO ISSUES RELATED TO SECURITY JAIL AUTHORITIES WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM CONDITIONING VISITATION TERMS OF VISITATION ON BEHAVIOR AND DISCIPLINE CONSIDERATIONS. THIS LANGUAGE WOULD ALSO PRECLUDE THE SUSPENSION OF VISITATION THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY PRISON THE MOST JAILED BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH NECESSITATED LIMITING ACCESS TO AND MOVEMENT WITHIN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. FOR THE MEDICAL SAFETY OF INMATES AND STAFF. CHALLENGES LIKE OTHER PANDEMICS NATURAL DISASTERS AND EVEN LOGISTICAL REALITIES LIKE POWER OUTAGES AND HVAC BREAKDOWNS. WOULD NOT SUFFICE AS LEGITIMATE REASONS TO CANCEL OR POSTPONE VISITATION UNDER THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY SOME JAIL FACILITIES PROVIDE VISITATION VIA VIDEO TECHNOLOGY. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN PERMITTED UNDER STATUTE AND REGULATION IN PLACE AT THE TIME. AND AB NINE NINETY WERE OSTENSIBLY IMPOSE MASSIVE MANDATED COSTS. IN PERSON VISITATION WERE REQUIRED BY THIS BILL. FOR THESE REASONS AND AS PREVIOUSLY STATED CSSA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY NINE NINETY THANK YOU.
