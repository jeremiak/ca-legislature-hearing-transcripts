UP LEARNING IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.856
ON LEARNING CONTEXT. AND THE

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:39.557
SHIFT TO PEOPLE'S HOME

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.626
ENVIRONMENT WAS AN EVENLY

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.362
EXPERIENCED BY OUR STUDENTS NOT

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:46.297
EVERYBODY'S HOME ENVIRONMENT

COULD BE ADAPTED TO OUR AND

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.902
EFFECTIVE AND CONDUCIVE.

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.303
ENVIRONMENTS FOR OPTIMAL

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.140
LEARNING AND- AND MANY OF US

00:27:55.206 --> 00:28:01.646
KNOW ALSO THAT WE'RE. HAVING ON

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:03.515
OUR CAMPUS NOW- FOR EXAMPLE AS-

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.616
FOLKS THAT ARE ARE BEING ON THE

K. FOR TO TIME. AND OUR AND

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.654
SOME OF OUR FRESHMEN HAD FOR

HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IN PERSON

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:23.268
LEARNING SO IT'S AN ADJUSTMENT.

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:26.271
PERIOD- AND OUR END WE WERE IN

00:28:26.337 --> 00:28:29.340
A GLOBAL. AND SOAK EVEN THOUGH

00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:30.308
THERE WAS CONTINUITY OF

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.845
LEARNING. THE ROUTE THE SAME

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:37.449
PROCESSES WORK THE SECOND. IN

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:39.984
REMOTE SO WE'RE ALL HAVING TO

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:42.187

BEING ON CAMPUS AND OUR

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:47.292
CAMPUSES ARE LEARNING FROM EVEN

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:50.295
AS THEY HAVE PREPARED TO DEAL

WITH THAT- ALL RIGHT ATTY AND I

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.902

PROGRAMS DURING THE SUMMER WE

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.380
THINK THOSE WERE. VERY

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.815
IMPORTANT TO MITIGATE THOSE

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:13.418
LEARNING LOSSES WE DO THINK

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:16.488

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.141
EQUITY GAPS THAT WE HAVE TO.

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.199
SUPPORT IS GETTING THE LOWEST

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.667
FUNDING AND THIS THE LOWEST

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.036
STAFFED. WHEN WE REALLY IF WE

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:28.103
REALLY WANT TO GET SERIOUS

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.506
ABOUT EDUCATION EQUITY. AND FOR

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.674

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.442
ALSO CAN LEAD TO HEALTHIER

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.077
INDIVIDUALS AND HEALTHIER

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.247
COMMUNITIES IN THE FUTURE. THEN

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:38.881
WE REALLY NEED TO START GETTING

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.149
SERIOUS ABOUT. FINDING THOSE

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:44.386
AREAS EQUITABLY AS WELL. I HAVE

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:48.657
TWO QUESTIONS- SO YOU KNOW THE

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.626
FIRST QUESTION IS THIS PANDEMIC

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.061
IS HAS SHOWN ALL OF US IN

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.063
DIFFERENT AREAS THAT WE DON'T

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.264
ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THINGS THE

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.633
SAME AND I THINK THAT- EACH OF

TEACHING DIFFERENT MODELS OF

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.472
LEARNING. SO MY QUESTION FOR

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:04.707
YOU MY FIRST QUESTION IS

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.208
WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:08.744
ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT. CHANGING

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:11.113
THAT TUITION STRUCTURE. FOR

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.716
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE DOING.

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:16.185
EITHER HYBRID OR ALL. DISTANCE

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:24.260
LEARNING IN THE FUTURE. THAT

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.295
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:26.962

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:30.533
FIRST- RESPONSE THERE- YOU KNOW

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:33.302
I THINK CERTAINLY- IN THE LAST

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:34.703
YEAR AND A HALF WITH THE

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.439
TRANSITION TO- ONLINE REMOTE

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.276
INSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW OUR OUR

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.844
INSTITUTIONS PIVOTED QUICKLY.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.013
AND I THINK YOU KNOW EVERYONE

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:47.383
RESPONDED- ENACTED- ADMIRABLY

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:48.217
AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:49.718
ADJUSTMENT QUICKLY ESPECIALLY

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.053
FOR RELEASED MANY OF OUR

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.454
INSTITUTIONS WILL THAT ARE MORE

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:55.558
THE- SMALLER CLASSES LIBERAL

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:56.425
ARTS MODEL RIGHT THERE AREN'T

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.327
IS. RELEASED BY THE PANDEMIC

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.430
DID NOT USE ONLINE VIRTUAL-

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.632
CLASSES AND IS MUCH ABUNDANCES

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.635
PERHAPS OTHER INSTITUTIONS- I

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:11.340
AM NOT AWARE OF- MANY IF ANY

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.908
DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW AROUND

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.009
TUITION RESETS OR THINGS LIKE

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.011
THAT- CERTAINLY SEVERAL YEARS

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:16.912
AGO I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR%

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.514
WITH THE MILLS COLLEGE TUITION

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.649
RESET THAT THEY WENT THROUGH- I

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.417
DO KNOW THAT DURING THE

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:22.685
PANDEMIC THAT SEVERAL OF OUR

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:26.388
INSTITUTIONS- IMPLEMENTED-

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:27.489
ADDITIONAL TUITION DISCOUNT

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.425
MEASURES. PARTICULARLY FOR

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.727
REGIONAL STUDENTS BECAUSE MANY

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:32.227
OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.730
REGIONALLY SERVING- WHERE FOR

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.600
EXAMPLE- IT MIGHT EVEN SAN

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.101
DIEGO CHRISTIAN COLLEGE AND IN

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.469
YOUR AREA OF THE STATE THAT

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:43.005
OFFERED ESSENTIALLY- FINANCIAL

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.341
AID- MATCH IF A STUDENT'S CAL

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.842
GRANT ELIGIBLE IN THE REGION

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:47.776
AND THAT THEY WOULD BASICALLY

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:50.512
OFFER A COMPARABLE- ACCESS

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.548
POINT FOR. STUDENTS TO IF THEY

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.917
WERE TO ATTEND THE CSU- I THINK

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.753
CERTAINLY WITH THE CHANGE AND-

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.154
THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS OF SEEN

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.624
AND IN OUR SURVEY WE DID FIND

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.725
THAT A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.026
ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.296
CONTINUE USING- ONLINE LEARNING

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.297
IN SOME FORM THAT MAYBE THEY

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.232
DIDN'T BEFORE- THEY'LL CONTINUE

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.734
TO EVALUATE THAT IN THE CONTEXT

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.039
OF THEIR OPERATIONAL- BUDGETS

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:17.539
AND NEEDS TO SERVE THEIR

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.675
MISSION. IT'S THANK YOU. THANK

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:20.809
YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I'D

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:24.213
LIKE TO ANSWER THROUGH THE CSU

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.415
LANCE AND SHARE WITH YOU THAT.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.117
WE'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC AND

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:31.387
COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.889
TUITION FEES FLAT. AND WE'VE

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.958
BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:39.128
SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND ONE OF

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:40.362
THE MAJOR REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.498
ABLE TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE OF

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:44.400
THE SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVED

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.402
FROM THE STATE TO ROUND OUT R.

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:50.773
OR **** SO WE DO NOT HAVE PLANS

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.741
TO INCREASE OUR TUITION FEES.

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:54.677
ALL THE WHILE WE KNOW THAT

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.512
COSTS ARE ALSO ACCELERATING

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.113
INCLUDING THE COST OF

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.315
TECHNOLOGY- PROFESSIONAL

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.685
DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.653
THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO OFFER.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.722
QUALITY ONLINE DIGITAL

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.857
EXPERIENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS. I

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:11.493
DO WANT TO REFLECT ON SOME WAYS

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.929
IN WHICH WE TRY TO EXPAND-

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.464
ECONOMIC RELIEF TO STUDENTS

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.433
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IN

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.735
PARTICULAR. WHEN I WAS AT THE

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:24.506
POMONA CAMPUS WE- WEIGHT OF ALL

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.942
COURSE FEES WHERE STUDENTS PAID

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.011
ADDITIONAL COURSE FEES BECAUSE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.547
THEY WERE IN A- IN A LAB FOR A

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.582
STUDIO WHERE THERE WERE

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:34.850
CONSUMABLE MATERIALS THAT

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.752
NEEDED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.654
THE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:39.488
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T COMING TO

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.923
THE LAB THROUGH THE STUDIOS

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:43.358
THOSE FEES WERE WAIVED AND NOT

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.794
CHARGE THE STUDENTS. SEMELE

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:46.662
BECAUSE STUDENTS WERE NOT

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.063
COMING ON TO THE CAMPUS IS

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.599
THINGS LIKE THE RECREATION FEE

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.501
A STUDENT FEES TO USE THAT

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:53.836
ATHLETIC FACILITIES ALL OF

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.071
THOSE WERE REIMBURSED BACK TO

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:59.041
THE STUDENTS. SO WE TRY TO LOOK

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.175
TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:15.124
OPPORTUNITIES TO- BUT THE

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:15.657
REIMBURSEMENT BACK TO THE

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:20.496
STUDENTS. THANK YOU I'M NOT

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.930

ARE NOT NECESSARILY CHEAPER

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:26.995
THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE

EXPENSIVE. SO HI WE HAVEN'T

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.535

RESOURCES SO WE'RE WE'RE WE

PHILLY THERE'S SOCIAL ISOLATION

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.383
ACCOUNT ACCOMPANYING THOSE

NEIGHBORING CSU CAMPUSES. THE

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:45.887
IMPORTANCE OF ADDING CULTURALLY

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.402
INVESTMENT WILL MAKE IMPORTANT

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.437
INROADS IN EXPANDING THAT T.

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.540
WORK FORCE BUT IN ADDITION TO

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.042
PERSONALITY THINK IT'S REALLY

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.645
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:13.081
STUDENTS SHOW UP ALONG THE

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:15.817

IMMEDIATE- ASSISTANCE BUT WE

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.756

STRATEGIES AT THEIR UNFOLDING

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:35.203
ON THE CAMPUSES. AND SO IT IN

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.038
ADDITION TO THAT CONTINUUM I

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:38.006
THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I'M

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.209
SEEING. IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:44.179

THEN RESPOND TO THE COMPLEXITY

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:09.538
OF THE ISSUES THAT STUDENTS

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.940
HAVE TO THIS COORDINATED CARE

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.775
MODEL IS SOMETHING WOULD WE

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.911
WANT TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.780

SALOMEA A YEAR I THINK IT'S A

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.678
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IN

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.081
TERMS OF BOTH. BEING ON THE

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:15.850
SAME PAGE AND IN HOW WE DEFINE

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:17.519
THESE CONCEPTS BUT ALSO HOW

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.320
WE'D GO ABOUT MEASURING THEM

WHEN WE WERE FOR TO LEARNING

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.229
GAPS THROUGH S. WHEN I REFER TO

IT IN MY PRESENTATION. I WAS

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:33.802
NOT MAKING A COMPARISON OF

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.273
WAY I WAS USING LEARNING GAPS

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:41.309
WAS WHAT WHAT EXPERIENCE WHAT

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.178

KNOW SEVERAL YEARS AGO MADE A

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:55.223
COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATE

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:58.092
REMEDIAL EDUCATION. WE MEET THE

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.328
STUDENTS WHERE THEIR ACT AND

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:01.996
DETERMINE WHERE THEY'RE AT

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.933
USING A STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:06.601
ARE ADMINISTERED IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:09.204
TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.804
READINESS IN MATH AND ENGLISH

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:11.940
THERE IN. AND ONE OF THINGS

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:14.409
THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THESE

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:15.310
MORE RECENT INCOMING CALL

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:19.113
FORTH. IS THE SLIGHT INCREASE

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:22.617
IN STUDENTS WHO ARE BASED ON

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.152

FULL LOWER LEVEL ON THAT

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.261
CONTINUUM. WHAT THAT MEANS THEN

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.562
IS THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.598

TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.073

TRANSITION BACK BUT IT OUT BUT

DOCTOR BROWN HAS UNDER IS

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.179
REALLY THE KEY POINT IN THAT IS

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:07.047
THAT THIS IS AN ACCESS AND

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:09.450
EQUITY ISSUE. AND THAT STUDENTS

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:12.052
WHO COME TO US WITH A VARIETY

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:14.355

CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR THEIR

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.425
ABILITY TO ACCESS LEARNING IN

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:20.227
THE QUOTE TRADITIONAL WAY. WE

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:21.829
NEED TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY'RE

01:38:21.895 --> 01:38:22.963
AT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:25.032
FINDING FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:26.734
WHEN WE STARTED TO PLAN FOR THE

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.669
RE POPULATION OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:31.138
WE HAVE TO INVEST IN DIFFERENT

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:33.607
TYPES OF MASS FOR OF

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.843
INSTRUCTORS WHO NEED HELP

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:37.411
STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:39.613
THEIR CLASSROOM NEEDED TO READ

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.384
THEIR LIPS. OR ON TRANSLATORS

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:44.718
SO IT'S A REALLY THINKING ABOUT

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.287
THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THOSE

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:49.923
STUDENTS. BUT ALSO. RECOGNIZING

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.892
AS WAS POINTED OUT THAT THERE

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.627
MAY BE SOME STUDENTS WHO. WHO

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:56.830
MAY HAVE. MOBILITY CHALLENGES

01:38:56.897 --> 01:38:59.466

DIGITAL MEDIATED FORMATS SO I

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.140
THINK THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:10.311
HIGHER IT HAS. IS TO PROVIDE.

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:13.347

INSTRUCTION. AND THOSE

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.752

THAT I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS

01:40:01.428 --> 01:40:03.097

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:47.741

ECHO MUCH OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES

01:40:58.919 --> 01:40:59.887
HAVE SAID I THINK THE ONLY

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:02.823
THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT- FOR

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:04.892
DISABLED STUDENTS AT FACULTY

COMPROMISED STUDENTS FACULTY

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:09.797

WHATEVER REASON- OR IT'S EASIER

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:22.543
FOR THEM TO ACCESS THEIR

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:23.811
COURSES OR OTHER SERVICES FROM

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:25.045

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.753
COMPROMISED OR OTHERWISE- AND I

OF OUR ANSWER. OF A- AS A

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:47.734
STRATEGY. AND SO I THINK YOU

01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:48.869
KNOW THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.871
LAYER OF- NOT ONLY MODALITY

IMPRESSIONS OF THE STUDENT

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:27.874

VERY GOOD. FRANKLY REPORTED

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.224
THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.226
IF STUDENTS IN MEDIUM SIZED AND

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:47.928
LARGER UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.996
WERE PRESENT BECAUSE MANY

01:47:50.063 --> 01:47:52.933
STUDENTS KEPT THEIR CAMERAS OFF

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:53.433
THROUGH THE ENTIRE CLASS

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.836
SESSIONS. MANY FACULTY WROTE

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:57.304
THAT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:59.339
SEEMED LESS ENGAGED WITH CLASS

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:01.241
MATERIALS AND THEY ARE IN

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.343
PERSON INSTRUCTION. STUDENT

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.478
ENGAGEMENT OR PRECISELY THE

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:07.380
LACK THEREOF WAS PERHAPS THE

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:09.082
SINGLE MOST MENTIONED

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:11.384
OBSERVATION AND THE SURVEY

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:13.019
QUESTIONS ABOUT INSTRUCTION.

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:16.957
IT'S ONE INSTRUCTOR WROTE QUOTE.

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:18.391
STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN CLASS

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:20.627
HAS OVERALL DRAMATICALLY

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.796
DECREASED IN JUST ONE YEAR IT

01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:24.664
BECAME A HABIT TO NEVER JOIN A

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:27.701
CLASS WITH A CAMERA ON AND TO

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:28.368
REALLY ALMOST NEVER ASK

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:32.405
QUESTIONS IN CLASS AND QUOTE.

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:35.442
ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME OF

01:48:35.508 --> 01:48:37.344
THE SITUATION IS THAT. THOSE

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:39.412
THINGS VERY WELL. MANY FACULTY

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:42.515
COMMENTED THAT THEY FOUND IT

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.917
DIFFICULT TO WRITE THE TYPE OF.

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:45.452
DETAILED HIGH QUALITY LETTERS

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:47.087
OF RECOMMENDATION IT HELPS

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:49.155
STUDENTS OBTAINING COMPETITIVE

01:48:49.222 --> 01:48:52.659
POSITIONS INTERNSHIPS AND OFFER

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:53.260
FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:56.196
SCHOOL. THE SURVEY RESULTS

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:58.098
SUGGEST THAT REMOTE INSTRUCTION

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.833
AT LEAST UNDER PANDEMIC

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.936
CONDITIONS WHAT'S LESS

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:03.436
EFFECTIVE THAN IN PERSON

01:49:03.503 --> 01:49:07.240
INSTRUCTION. 42% OF FACULTY

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:08.808
INDICATED THEY BELIEVED THAT

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.677
STUDENTS HAVE LESS

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:11.244
UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURSE

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:14.581
MATERIAL. 31% BELIEVE STUDENTS

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:16.549
HAD MORE ACADEMIC DIFFICULTY IN

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:18.652
REMOTE INSTRUCTION COMPARED TO

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:21.488
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THE

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:22.856
SURVEY ALSO TRIED TO GET IN

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.357
ANOTHER DEFEAT THE MENTION OF

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:25.992
THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.928
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY AMONG

01:49:27.994 --> 01:49:31.231
STUDENTS WE ASK THIS BECAUSE

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:32.432
THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:33.833
AMONG COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.169
ACROSS THE NATION ABOUT

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:39.139
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY. GRADUATES

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:40.006
SEEMINGLY IN EVER LARGER

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:42.575
NUMBERS ARE USING EXTERNAL

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:44.978
STUDENT TUTORING WEBSITES TO

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:45.879
GET ANSWERS TO HOMEWORK

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:48.648
ASSIGNMENTS AND TEST QUESTIONS.

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:51.318
THIS CONCERN INTENSIFIED DURING

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:52.519
THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE ALL

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.287
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND TESTS

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:56.957
AND PAPERS AND STUFF WE'RE DONE

01:49:57.023 --> 01:50:01.127
REMOTELY. 54% OF FACULTY.

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:02.395
REPORTED THAT THEY PERCEIVED

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.230
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY TO BE

01:50:04.297 --> 01:50:06.232
HIGHER OR MUCH HIGHER DURING

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:08.268
THAT STRETCH. BOB LET ME NOT

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:10.203
CONVEY AN IMPRESSION OF BLAMING

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:13.106
STUDENTS THE PANDEMIC AND

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:14.708
LOCKED THEM OR HARD ON EVERYONE

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.710
AND MOST POIGNANT ASPECT OF

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:18.645
FACTLY RESPONSES WAS THEIR

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:21.247
SENSE OF STUDENTS EXPRESSED

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.615
ABOUT HARDSHIP. STUDENTS

01:50:22.682 --> 01:50:24.617
EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSORS WIDE

01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:26.653
RANGE OF PROBLEMS FOR COURSE

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.888
RELATED DIFFICULTIES TO

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:29.756
OVERWHELMING PERSONAL

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:32.359
CHALLENGES INCLUDING HIGH RATES

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:32.959
OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:36.029
DISTRESS. IN MANY OF THE OPEN

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:38.298
ENDED COMMENTS ON THE SURVEY IT

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.500
WAS CLEAR HOW DIFFICULT THE

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:44.671
SITUATION WAS FOR EVERYONE. AS

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:47.440
ONE PROFESSOR WROTE QUOTE.

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.041
EVERYTHING WAS TERRIBLE FOR MY

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:51.578
STUDENTS. IT WAS AWFUL OPENING

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:53.847
MY EMAILS AND QUOTE.

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:55.849
NOTWITHSTANDING IT IS IMPORTANT

01:50:55.915 --> 01:50:56.683
TO CELEBRATE THAT THE

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:58.485
UNIVERSITY DID ITS JOB

01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:01.521
FACTORYTALK COURSES STUDENT.

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.156
CHRIS WORK PASSED AND MOVED TO

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:06.292
HAD DEGREES WERE CONFERRED.

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:08.628
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION OUT THERE

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.463
THAT NOT MUCH WAS LEARNED AT

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.665
UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:14.667
BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S TOO EARLY

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:16.703
TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION. OR

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.271
WHETHER LEARNING LOSS IT'S

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:20.040
BEING CALLED WAS DIFFERENT

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:21.841
ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS OF

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:24.177
STUDENTS AND WHAT THE LONG

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:26.513
RANGE EFFECTS. WILL BE THAT

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:29.049
SAD. THE CONCEPT OF LEARNING

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:30.350
WERE ALL LOST HAS ALREADY

01:51:30.417 --> 01:51:32.118
ENTERED THE LEXICON AND WILL BE

01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:34.187
TALKED ABOUT EVEN WITHOUT REAL

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:37.190
DATA I THINK WE NEED THE DATA.

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:38.825
TO THAT END WE SHOULD LOOK

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:41.928
CLOSELY AT HOW THE NEXT YEAR

01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:44.264
UNFOLDS AND WHAT MIGHT BE KEY

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:46.099
INDICES TO TRACK WE MIGHT

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:47.934
EXAMINE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.302
CONCEPTS COVERED IN A

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:51.171
PRELIMINARY COURSE ARE

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:53.206
INTEGRATED AND USED BY STUDENTS

01:51:53.273 --> 01:51:56.376
AS THEY MOVE INTO THE NEXT

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:57.444
COURSE IN THE SEQUENCE. MY OWN

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.846
SENSE OF THE WAY TO RECOVER

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:02.182
WITH EQUITY IS TO GET STUDENTS

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:04.317
AND FACULTY AND STAFF BACK TO

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:06.786
CAMPUS. BACK TO IN PERSON

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.655
INSTRUCTION BACKED INTO OUR

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:10.990
LIVING BACK TO THE INTERNET

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:13.560
PRESS. FOUND SOCIAL

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:15.962
INTERACTIONS THAT FUEL LEARNING

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:17.831
AND PERSONAL GROWTH. WITHOUT

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.265
HICCUPS OF CAMPUS RE OPENING

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:23.002

PALPABLE AND LEARNING. FOUND

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:34.614
DEEP LEARNING IS HAPPENING. AND

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:36.850
THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:37.317

MONTHS. I WILL TALK A LITTLE

01:53:48.454 --> 01:53:49.255
BIT ABOUT MY PERSONAL

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:50.523
PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH ME THE

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:53.660
BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES ABOUT

RETURNING TO CAMPUS- TALKING

SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE ACADEMIC

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:58.131
AND PROFESSIONAL MATTERS.

01:53:58.198 --> 01:53:59.132
RATHER THAN WORKPLACE

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.934
CONDITIONS AND THEN FINALLY A

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.101
LITTLE BIT ABOUT RECOVERY WITH

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:03.369
EQUITY IN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

01:54:03.436 --> 01:54:05.238
FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO FIRST OF

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:08.007
ALL WE OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED- A

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.209
SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE NUMBER

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:10.443
OF STUDENTS THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:12.946
TAKE CLASSES FULL TIME- ONE OF

01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:14.180
THE THINGS THAT I WAS ABLE TO

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:15.682
DO IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:16.849
TWENTY WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:17.917
FOR AN ACADEMIC SENATE VICE

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.686
PRESIDENT. IS TO ACTUALLY TEACH

01:54:19.752 --> 01:54:23.156
A CLASS- NORMALLY WE ARE NOT

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:24.557
ALLOWED TO TEACH OUR SCHEDULES

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:26.626
ARE TOO CRAZY BUT- I HAD BEEN

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:28.194
PERMITTED TO TEACH ONE ONLINE

01:54:28.261 --> 01:54:30.597
CLASS IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:31.231
TWENTY ONE THING I SHOULD POINT

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:32.465
OUT IS THAT I'VE TAUGHT ONLINE

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:34.667
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THIS

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:35.702
WAS NOT A DIFFICULT TRANSITION

01:54:35.768 --> 01:54:39.339
FOR ME- I HAD BEEN DOING THIS

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:40.006
FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES TO AND-

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.941
HALF DECADE. AT THAT POINT. AND

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:42.609
ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED

01:54:42.675 --> 01:54:43.776
IMMEDIATELY WAS THAT THE

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:44.944
MAJORITY OF MY STUDENTS WERE

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:45.845
NOT PREPARED FOR THE

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:47.480
TRANSITION. MANY OF THEM

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:50.016
STRUGGLED WITH A WIDE VARIETY

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.884
OF ISSUES INCLUDING THEIR OWN.

01:54:51.951 --> 01:54:53.753
LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. THEIR

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.556
INABILITY TO ACCESS MATERIALS.

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:59.125
THEIR LACK OF TECHNOLOGY- AND

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.727
QUITE FRANKLY IT MADE ME MORE

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:02.729
COMPASSIONATE. IT'S MADE ME A

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:04.230
BETTER TEACHER. WITH WHAT I

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:05.932
WENT THROUGH- DURING THAT

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.800
SPRING TWENTY TWENTY. ONE OF

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:08.701
THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:11.070
CLEARLY ABOUT THE EQUITY GAPS

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:12.905
AND THE NEED TO MITIGATE THE

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:13.673
LEARNING LOSS IS THAT WE NEED

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:15.808
MORE DATA- WE NEED TO SHARE

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:17.910
STUDENT SURVEY DATA. THE

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:19.812
STUDENT SENATE DID A TOWN HALL

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:21.881
IN A SERIES OF SURVEYS IN TWO

01:55:21.948 --> 01:55:22.949
THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE.

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:25.518
WE NEED THAT TO BE EXPANDED- AS

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:27.620
YOU'RE WELL AWARE WE COVER A

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:29.289
HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES.

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:30.890
IN ALL BUT ONE COUNTY OF THE

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:33.259
STATE. WE DO NOT HEAR FROM SOME

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:34.394
OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.862
HEAR FROM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:55:35.928 --> 01:55:37.530
PARTICIPATE OR THEY'RE UNABLE

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:39.399
TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO A

01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:41.267
BROADER RANGE OF SURVEY DATA

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:42.535
AND MORE INFORMATION FROM

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:43.836
STUDENTS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:46.072
NECESSARY. WE ALSO NEED SOME

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:48.174
DISAGGREGATED DATA THERE'S A

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:49.409
TENDENCY TO LUMP A LOT OF

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:51.744
GROUPS TOGETHER OUR API FACULTY

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:53.279
OR STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ALL

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:55.348
LUMPED INTO ONE CATEGORY. WE

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:56.916
NEED TO DISAGGREGATE THAT

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:59.319
INFORMATION- ALL OF THIS WILL

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:01.154
HELP TO IDENTIFY COLLEGES

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.755
DISTRICTS AND EVEN INDIVIDUAL

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:04.223
FACULTY THAT ARE DOING GOOD

01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:05.892
WORK AND ENABLE US TO SHARE

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.794
THOSE PRACTICES. ESPECIALLY

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.429
WORK AROUND ENGAGING STUDENTS

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:11.297
MAKING CAMPUS MORE WELCOMING

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:12.465
WHETHER IT'S IN PERSON OR

01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:15.368
ONLINE. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:16.169
INCREASED PROFESSIONAL

01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:17.904
DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY ON HOW

01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:19.639
TO ENGAGE STUDENTS BEST

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:21.641
PRACTICES FOR DOING SO AND

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:23.543
PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.345
WHO CONTINUE TO TEACH ONLINE.

01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:26.479
ALL OF THESE THINGS OF COURSE

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:28.748
REQUIRE FUNDING AS WELL AS

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:31.184
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. THE

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:33.119
TRANSITION ONLINE WAS NOT EASY

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.021
IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY I AM

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:36.255
FROM DISTRICT WHICH PRIDES

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.890
ITSELF ON ITS ONLINE CLASSES

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:40.393
AND YET WE STRUGGLED- AND SO I

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.894
CAN'T IMAGINE CAMPUSES ARE

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.262
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VIRTUALLY

01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:46.132
NO ONLINE PREVIOUSLY. I WORKED

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:48.534
CLOSELY WITH NURSING FACULTY-

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.103
WHICH IS QUITE AN EXCEPTIONAL

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:51.604
ACCOMPLISHMENT SINCE I AM

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:53.072
MYSELF A HISTORIAN AND TEACH

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.174
WOMEN'S STUDIES- BUT I WORKED

01:56:55.241 --> 01:56:56.042
WITH THE NURSING FACULTY TO

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:58.277
WORK ON. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:56:58.344 --> 01:56:59.512
WEBINARS AND WAYS THAT THEY CAN

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:01.447
USE SIMULATION IN THEIR CLASSES

01:57:01.514 --> 01:57:02.815
I LEARNED A LOT INCLUDING THAT

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:03.916
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE AN ALLIED

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:05.551
HEALTH FACULTY MEMBER. BECAUSE

01:57:05.618 --> 01:57:06.886
I WAS TERRIFIED THAT THE FAKE

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:07.920
BABY WAS GOING TO DIE AND I

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:09.222
ALMOST BURST INTO TEARS DURING

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:11.391
ONE OF THE SIMULATIONS. NOT A

01:57:11.457 --> 01:57:13.926
GOOD PLAYER. HOWEVER ONE OF THE

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:15.161
THINGS WE NOTICED WAS THAT THIS

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:17.029
WAS NOT A SYSTEMIC OR A

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:20.299
WIDESPREAD USE OF TOOLS. WE SAW

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:23.002
SOME CAMPUSES PROVIDE THEIR ALL

01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:23.903
THEIR FACULTY WITH WIFI

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:26.172
HOTSPOTS WITH COMPUTERS WITH.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:27.874
ALL KINDS OF THINGS OTHER

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.475
CAMPUSES DID NOT. WE

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:30.877
PARTICULARLY SOUGHT IN OUR

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:32.712
ADJUNCT AND PART TIME FACULTY

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:34.480
WHO STRUGGLED MANY OF WHOM HAVE

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.716
LOST CLASSES. C. AND REDUCED

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.851
THE SCENE REDUCED INCOMES. AND

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:40.953
ARE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.356
THEIR STATUS ON OUR CAMPUSES-

01:57:43.423 --> 01:57:44.557
DEPENDING ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS

01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:45.992
OR DISTRICT IN SOME CASES

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.560
ADDITIONAL FACULTY AND STAFF

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:49.395
WERE HIRED TO HELP FACULTY

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:51.464
TRANSITION. THERE WERE STIPENDS

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.399
PROVIDED AT SOME DISTRICTS.

01:57:53.466 --> 01:57:55.201
SUPPORT SERVICES WERE ALSO SET

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:57.470
UP. BUT SYSTEMICALLY THE MAJOR

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.272
SOURCE OF HELP CAME FROM THE

01:57:59.338 --> 01:58:01.307
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WITH THE

01:58:01.374 --> 01:58:02.508
NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OF THE

01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:03.943
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PURCHASED

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:06.112
WITH THEIR PURCHASING POWER. TO

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:07.613
ENABLE CLASSES TO TRANSLATE THE

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.582
SPECIALLY LAB CLASSES INTO AN

01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:11.984
ONLINE FORMAT- THEY ALSO

01:58:12.051 --> 01:58:13.686
ASSISTED WITH CHANGES IN

01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:15.922
GRADING POLICIES. ARE EXTENDING

01:58:15.988 --> 01:58:17.423
THE PERIOD DURING WHICH PASS NO

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.158
PASS COULD BE USED EXTENDING

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.893
THE PERIOD DURING WHICH EXCUSED

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.695
WITHDRAWAL COULD BE USED. AND

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:24.063
THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.832
STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.133
HAVE STRUGGLED OR WOULD NOT

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:28.100
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:30.303
THEIR CLASSES. OR DECIDED THAT

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:31.504
THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE THE

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.805
CLASS BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:37.210
RISK A VERY LOW GRADE- AND SO

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.044
THEY TO PASS NO PASS INSTEAD-

01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:39.412
IN ADDITION ABOUT MY PERSONAL

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:40.947
PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL SAY IT

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.248
DID MAKE ME MORE COMPASSIONATE

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.950
I THINK I'M MUCH NICER NOW

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:46.319
WHICH- I GUESS IS A GOOD THING-

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:47.787
I WAS MORE FLEXIBLE WITH

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:49.355
ASSESSMENTS I WAS MORE FLEXIBLE

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:51.123
WITH DUE DATES. MY COLLEGE

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:53.259
HAPPENS TO BE ON QUARTERS SO.

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:55.228
THEY'RE SUPER FAST ANYWAY AND

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:57.163
SO WHEN YOU THROW IN A GLOBAL

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:59.899
PANDEMIC- WE WERE FORTUNATE WE

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.300
WERE FINISHING OUR WINTER

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.768
QUARTER WHEN THE PANDEMIC IN

01:59:02.835 --> 01:59:04.737
THE SHUTDOWN STARTED. AND SO WE

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:06.339
WERE ABLE TO TAKE AN EXTRA WEEK

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:08.407
OF SPRING BREAK TO PREPARING

01:59:08.474 --> 01:59:10.243
FOR EVERYONE AND TO GET.

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:10.910
ACCLIMATED TO THE NEW

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:13.546
ENVIRONMENT- BUT I WILL SAY

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:14.480
THAT I HAD STUDENTS WHO

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:15.781
ACTUALLY STARTED REACHING OUT

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:17.116
TO ME AND I STARTED DOING A LOT

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:19.218
OF. ONLINE INVOLVEMENT WITH

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:20.987
ZOOM AND TALKING TO STUDENTS

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.154
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE

01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:25.057
OKAY AND- HEARING THEIR STORIES

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.926
AND- ONE OF MY STUDENTS REACH

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.094
OUT TO ME AFTER ABOUT THE THIRD

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.428
WEEK AND SAID I'M A MINUTE A

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:31.564
MINUTE COMPROMISED. I AM LIKELY

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:32.532
GOING TO HAVE TO DROP YOUR

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:34.267
CLASS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.502
TO. NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:38.404
ANYTHING. ANYTHING AND SHE WAS

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.906
BRILLIANT SHE WAS THE BEST IN

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:41.541
THE CLASS AT THAT POINT. I

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.309
BEGGED HER TO STAY SHE SAID NOT

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:44.410
HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL I

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:47.313
CAN'T DO THIS I'M SORRY AND SHE

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:47.914
CAME BACK ABOUT TEN DAYS LATER

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.181
AND SAID. HEY THEY LET ME OUT

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:50.716
OF THE HOSPITAL I'M IN THE SAFE

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:52.718
ENVIRONMENT. CAN I JOIN YOUR

01:59:52.785 --> 01:59:54.053
CLASS AGAIN AND I SAID THE

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.154
ABSOLUTELY YOU WERE DOING A

01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:56.455
GREAT JOB I HAVE NO PROBLEM

01:59:56.522 --> 01:59:57.757
WITH THIS AT ALL. SHE GOT THE

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:58.891
HIGHEST GRADE IN THE CLASS

01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:01.060
SHE'S GOING TO STANFORD. SO

02:00:01.127 --> 02:00:03.329
THOSE KINDS OF SUCCESSES ARE

02:00:03.396 --> 02:00:05.698
WHAT KEEP US GOING- MY

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:08.234
COLLEAGUE ROBERT. A REFERENCE

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.268
TO THE EXHAUSTION WE'RE ALL

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:11.304
EXHAUSTED. EVERY FACULTY MEMBER

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.673
I SPEAK TO IS EXHAUSTED. WE'RE

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.875
ABSOLUTELY TIRED. MORE

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:17.410
INITIATIVES NOT THE WAY TO GO

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.211
AT THIS POINT. LET US JUST.

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.179
PLEASE TRY TO GET THROUGH ALL

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:22.048
THIS- BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:22.915
BARRIERS FOR US GOING BACK

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:26.352
CAMPUS. UP ALL I BELIEVE OF OUR

02:00:26.419 --> 02:00:27.253
SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS HAVE

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.387
CLASSES BACK ON CAMPUS AT THIS

02:00:28.454 --> 02:00:31.457
POINT- AS DAVID O'BRIEN POINTED

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:33.492
OUT WE NEVER CLOSED- WE NEVER

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.595
SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY. OTHER

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:36.963
WERE SOME CAMPUSES WERE FACULTY

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:38.264
WERE BACK ON CAMPUS WITHIN

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:39.599
WEEKS OF THE INITIAL SHUTDOWN

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:41.734
TEACHING OUR CTE COURSES. OUR

02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:44.070
FIRST RESPONDER COURSES AND THE

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:46.105
LIKE- BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:00:46.172 --> 02:00:47.540
CHALLENGES A LOT OF THEM AROUND

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:50.176
WORKING CONDITIONS- AROUND MASK

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:51.043
MANDATES AROUND EXCEED

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:55.314
MANDATES- BUT- THERE ARE ALSO

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:58.050
ISSUES AROUND THINGS LIKE.

02:00:58.117 --> 02:01:00.620
MATERIALS ON CAMPUS- IT'S

02:01:00.686 --> 02:01:02.254
DIFFICULT TO TEACH SOME CLASSES

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.756
ONLINE THEY NEED TO BE TAUGHT

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.858
IN PERSON DO WE HAVE ENOUGH PP

02:01:05.925 --> 02:01:08.861
FOR THE FACULTY TO TEACH- DO WE

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:09.762
HAVE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.298
CAN MAKE- I REALLY APPRECIATED

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:13.666
THE QUESTION ABOUT DISABLED

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:16.702
STUDENTS- DORADO AND I ARE ON

02:01:16.769 --> 02:01:17.803
THE STUDENTS HUNDRED LISTENING

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:19.839
TOUR WHICH IS TRAVELING TO

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:21.340
SEVEN COLLEGES THIS QUARTER.

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:24.644
SORRY THIS TERM CAN'T HELP BUT-

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:26.212
AND LISTENING TO STUDENTS ABOUT

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:27.346
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT OUR

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:30.016
LAST TOUR WE HAD A- A MOTHER OF

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.083
A STUDENT WHO IS DISABLED

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:32.518
TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH HAD BEEN

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.720
CLOSE TO THEM DURING THE

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:36.822
PANDEMIC IT WAS HEARTBREAKING-

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:39.025
AS SOMEONE WHO IS ENGAGED TO A

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.726
MAN WHO HAS MOBILITY ISSUES

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:41.827
WALKING AROUND A COUPLE OF THE

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:43.896
CAMPUSES HAS BEEN. A CLEAR

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:45.431
INDICATOR THAT THEY ARE NOT

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.333
DESIGNED FOR OUR STUDENTS AND

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.734
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.703
OTHER ISSUES HAVE MADE THEM

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:53.039
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT- FINALLY

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:54.140
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:55.975
RECOVERY WITH THE EQUITY. WE

02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:57.977
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE CAN'T

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:00.279
PLACE BLAME ON ANY ONE GROUP OR

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:02.014
ANYONE SET OF PEOPLE FOR WHAT

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:03.849
HAS HAPPENED. THERE ARE SO MANY

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.418
VARIABLES AND CIRCUMSTANCES TO

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:07.153
CONSIDER. THAT IT'S REALLY

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.554
IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:10.456
HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:12.191
AND- THE NEEDS THAT WE'RE

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:13.459
HEARING FROM FACULTY AND

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:15.428
STUDENTS AND STAFF. ESPECIALLY

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.862
IN AREAS WHERE THERE MAY BE AN

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:19.465
INCREASE OF EQUITY GAPS- ALONG

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:20.332
WITH DIVERSITY CUT

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:21.901
DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FACULTY

02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:23.202
AND THE STUDENTS ARE SYSTEM

02:02:23.269 --> 02:02:26.072
COMES THE NEED. FOR A DIVERSITY

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:28.107
IN SOLUTIONS TO NAVIGATE

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:31.844
LEARNING AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WE

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:32.978
ALSO REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:34.880
MENTAL HEALTH POST PANDEMIC I

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:36.282
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:38.150
THAT- OUR FACULTY AND STAFF

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:39.318
NEED THAT ESPECIALLY OUR

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:42.388
ADJUNCT FACULTY- WHO IN MANY

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:42.855
CASES AS I SAID BEFORE

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:45.257
STRUGGLING. AND FINALLY I JUST

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:46.358
WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S BECOME

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:48.527
MORE CLEAR THAT SOLUTIONS

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:50.930
AROUND THIS NEED TO COME. FROM

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:52.298
THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:53.332
STUDENTS THAT IS THE

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:55.968
PRACTITIONERS ON THE CAMPUSES.

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.304
OF FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS

02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:00.239
AND THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES-

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.607
THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR MORE

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:02.842
COUNSELLING SUPPORT FOR

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:04.343
STUDENTS THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:06.312
FOR OTHER PIECES THE DORADO AND

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:08.781
I BOTH HEARD ABOUT- ALLOWING

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:10.549
STUDENTS TO STAY ON THEIR PATH

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:11.684

BUT GETTING STUDENTS IN AND OUT

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:21.694

PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO MEET

02:03:26.132 --> 02:03:27.867

COLLEGES. THE STUDENT SENATE IS

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:54.894
UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT WE

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.395
REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.464
POPULATION. OF STUDENTS IN THE

MILLION STUDENTS AND IT'S

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.005
REALLY HARD TO GAUGE STUDENT

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:08.340

02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:12.778
DIVERSE. POPULATION BUT- THANK

ME IN OUR STATE IS RE OPENING-

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:19.151
BECAUSE WE ARE VISITING OUR

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:20.920
STUDENTS. WERE COMING TO THEM.

02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:22.188
ARE WE ARE LEADING THE SYSTEM

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:23.355
BY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:25.991
CALLING TO THE STUDENTS AND THE

02:04:26.058 --> 02:04:28.194
STUDENTS ARE NOT COMING TO US-

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.195
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.330
WANT TO ADDRESS IS THE IMPACT.

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:32.298
OF THE PANDEMIC TO OUR

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:34.533
STUDENTS. ARE FAR BEYOND SOCIAL

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.102
ECONOMIC IMPACTS ABOUT FOCUS ON

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:37.903
THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.605
STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS SENATE

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:40.873
CONDUCTED A SURVEY THAT

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:44.343
COLLECTED THE STORIES OF FIVE

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:44.910
HUNDRED AND THIRTY STUDENTS

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:46.545
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND A

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:49.381
COMMON THING THAT WE SEE IS-

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:50.950
THE EXHAUSTION OF THE MENTAL

02:04:51.016 --> 02:04:53.152
EXHAUSTION IN THE EMOTIONAL

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:53.719
EXHAUSTION THAT OUR STUDENTS

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:55.855
ARE IN DURING. IN THAT LEADS

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:59.491
TO. LEARNING LOSS ARE THAT THAT

02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:01.126
LEADS INTO OUR DECLINE

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.829
ENROLLMENT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:06.465
STUDENTS FEEL- HOPELESS. I HAVE

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:07.867
TO SAY THE LEAST THEY FEEL

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:10.236
HOPELESS BY CONTINUING. THIS IS

02:05:10.302 --> 02:05:14.006
EDUCATION- IN THERE'S NO.

02:05:14.073 --> 02:05:16.742
CONSENSUS ON DISTANCE EDUCATION

02:05:16.809 --> 02:05:20.279
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A-

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:22.514
DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS.

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:24.350
AND ONLINE EDUCATION HAS BEEN

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.819
HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.254
FOR SOME POPULATIONS IT HAS

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.788
BEEN IT HAS BECOME A BURDEN AND

02:05:29.855 --> 02:05:31.657
HAS BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:34.960
THEIR SUCCESS. IN WITHIN THOSE

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:35.461
FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX-

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:37.730
STORIES THAT WE SAW. THERE'S

02:05:37.796 --> 02:05:40.065
ONE STORY THAT- REALLY

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:43.669
HIGHLIGHTS HOW FAR CAN DEPEND

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:44.370
THAT MAY GO TO AFFECT OUR

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:46.305
STUDENTS. THERE WAS A STORY

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:49.241
THAT A STUDENT- SHE'S MARRIED-

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.143
IN DURING THE PANDEMIC. I SEE

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:52.711
HAD ANNOUNCED SAFE ENVIRONMENT

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:56.815
AT HOME- SHE EXPERIENCED ABUSE.

02:05:56.882 --> 02:06:01.053
PHYSICAL. ABUSE FROM HER SPOUSE-

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.187
IS SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NO ONE

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:03.155
TO TURN TO SO SHE BECAME

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:06.091
HOMELESS. THIS JUST PROVES THAT

02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:10.396
ARE COLLEGES ARE MORE THAN- OF

02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:12.698
THE CITIZENS OF LEARNING. I

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:13.866
COLLEGES HAVE BECOME A SECOND

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:16.201
HOME FOR STUDENTS THEY HAVE

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:16.802
BECOME IT'S THE SPACE FOR OUR

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:19.038
STUDENTS. AND WE'RE TALKING

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:21.273
ABOUT EQUITY GAPS. EQUITY GAPS

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.175
HAVE BEEN THERE- YOU KNOW SINCE

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:24.810
THE BEGINNING OF OUR

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:28.814
INSTITUTION- BUT THE THING THAT

02:06:28.881 --> 02:06:31.650
WE SEE IN THE PANDEMIC IS- ARE

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:32.418
YOU SEPARATE STUDENTS FROM THE

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.386
CAMPUS AND THAT IS WHERE WE

02:06:34.453 --> 02:06:36.722
START SEEING THE HOUSING

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.524
SECURITY THE FOOD AND SECURITY.

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.459
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ESPECIALLY

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.727
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BECAUSE MANY

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.395
OF OUR STUDENTS RELIED ON OUR

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:46.265
CAMPUS FOR LIBRARIES ARE

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:47.800
WRITING CENTERS THE COMPUTERS

02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:51.403
ARE ARE AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS.

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:54.340
AND WHEN WE WENT HOME BECAUSE

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:56.942
CAMPUS CLOSE IN MARCH TWENTY

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:57.609
TWENTY WE SAW HOW STUDENTS WERE

02:06:57.676 --> 02:06:59.345
STRUGGLING AND WE SAW HOW

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:01.280
STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE THE

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:04.083
TECHNOLOGY OR THE BROADBAND IN

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:06.518
ORDER TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR

02:07:06.585 --> 02:07:08.654
EDUCATION. SO WHAT ARE ONE

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:10.889
THINGS THAT I SAW IS A LOT OF

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:11.724
STUDENTS SIMPLY JUST DROPPED

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:14.460
OUT- I LIVE IN THE L. EMPIRE

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:16.462
ENSURE YOU MAY KNOW THAT WE

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:18.030
HAVE A LOT OF WAREHOUSES. IN

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:20.099
THE L. IMPAIRED- IN

02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:22.267
UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF MY PEERS

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:23.168
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:25.671
FRIENDS. ARE DECIDED TO PUT

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:27.873
ASIDE THEIR MISSIONS- OF

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:30.376
PURSUING EDUCATION. AND WENT TO

02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:32.378
THE WORK FORCE. ARE THEY

02:07:32.444 --> 02:07:33.879
DROPPED OUT COMPLETELY AND WENT

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.180
TO THE WAREHOUSE- AMAZON

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:36.782
WAREHOUSES THAT WE HAVE IN THE-

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:40.519
EMPIRE- IN THOSE ARE SIMILAR

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:41.153
STORIES THAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.188
THE STATE- MANY OF STUDENTS

02:07:43.255 --> 02:07:44.957
THAT- ONE OF THE FAMILY

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:47.626
MEMBERS. DIED ONE OF THE FAMILY

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:53.532
MEMBERS. BUY FOOD FOR THEIR

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:54.933
HOME FOR THEIR HOUSE ONLY MORE

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.035
SO THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO PUT

02:07:56.101 --> 02:07:57.970
AWAY THEIR AMBITION AND ENTER

02:07:58.037 --> 02:08:00.339
THE WORKFORCE TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:02.474
PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. ONE

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.542
OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO SEE

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:05.444
WHAT THE PANDEMIC. IS THAT IS

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:06.979
THE FINE CLASSISM IN OUR

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:09.948
SYSTEM. UNDERLYING CLASSES AND

02:08:10.015 --> 02:08:12.384
THAT WAS OFTEN IGNORED-

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:13.719
COMMITTEE CLOSE IS NO LONGER

02:08:13.786 --> 02:08:15.054
JUST FOR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS AND

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.555
TWENTY YEAR OLDS. WE SEE THIRTY

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:19.124
YEAR OLDS FORTY OR FIFTY YEAR

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:19.691
OLD EVEN SIX AND SEVEN YEAR

02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:21.860
OLDS. AND WE SEE THEIR SYSTEM

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:23.695
WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THEM. HOW

02:08:23.762 --> 02:08:25.964
DO WE SEE THAT- LIKE I SAID

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:28.067
WE'VE BEEN VISITING CAMPUSES.

02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:30.102
AND TO STUDENTS APPROACH ME AND

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:30.936
THEIR STUDENT PARENTS AND THEY

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:34.206
SAID. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:35.874
AREAS THAT I FACE AS A STUDENT

02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:38.010
PARENT IS THAT'S HEALTHCARE.

02:08:38.077 --> 02:08:40.045
ARTS HEALTHCARE HAS BECOME AN

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:43.248
IMPEDIMENT TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS-

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:45.017
JUST TO BE MORE SPECIFIC GOALS

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:47.219
TO STUDENTS THAT CHILD CARE

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:48.620
ENDS AT THREE PM. MY CLASSES

02:08:48.687 --> 02:08:51.090
UNTIL FIVE PM. WHAT DO YOU DO

02:08:51.156 --> 02:08:53.725
THEN- THEY SAID I HAD TO LEAVE

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.294
EARLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.330
CLASS EARLY- AND THAT IS HOW WE

02:08:58.397 --> 02:08:59.798
SEE THE EQUITY GAPS IN OUR

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:01.733
SYSTEM AND- HOW CAN WE ADDRESS

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:04.570
THAT. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:05.070
LISTENING TO THE STUDENT

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:07.573
EXPERIENCE- WE HELP OVER TWO

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:09.074
POINT MILLION STUDENTS AND EACH

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:11.176
OF THEM HAS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:14.012
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU.

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:15.547
WHAT THE PREVENTIVE COSTS DOWN

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:17.983
FOR THEM. WHAT HOW THE HEALTH

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:20.486
OF CONDEMNING AFFECTED THEM-

02:09:20.552 --> 02:09:21.887
BUT WE ALSO WOULD DEPEND THAT

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:23.589
MAKE WE HAVE SEEN INCREASE IN

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:25.724
ACCESSIBILITY. WE HAVE SEEN

02:09:25.791 --> 02:09:28.393
THAT ARE FOR ADULT LEARNERS OR

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.761
STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO MY

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:31.897
CLASSES. WE HAVE SEEN AN

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:33.932
EXPANSION OF OURS FOR

02:09:33.999 --> 02:09:38.036
COUNSELING- WE HAVE SEEN THAT.

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:39.805
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND EDUCATION

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:42.441
HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.443
MORE CONVENIENT FOR STUDENTS-

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:45.511
THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS

02:09:45.577 --> 02:09:47.312
WHERE STUDENTS TELL ME THAT IT

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:48.714
WAS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:49.848
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RETURN TO

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:51.683
CAMPUS BECAUSE OF DISTANCE

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.886
LEARNING. OTHERWISE THEY WOULD

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:57.923
HAVE COME BACK TO COLLEGE OR

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.291
START THE ACADEMIC JOURNEY. SO

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:01.126
THAT'S A POSITIVE IMPACT THAT

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:04.396
WE HAVE SEEN. BUT REGARDLESS OF

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:05.898
THE NEGATIVE ALWAYS THE

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:08.033
POSITIVE UNFORTUNATELY. AND ONE

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.034
OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:14.006
TO- ADDRESS- SPECIALLY WITH-

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:15.207
WHAT WAS STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:10:15.274 --> 02:10:18.177
TRANSFERRING- ONE OF THE THINGS

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.779
THAT WE DID SEE AND OUR SURVEY.

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:22.481
IS THAT STUDENTS HOW TO DELAY.

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:24.283
THE TRANSFER PROCESS I

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:26.285
PERSONALLY HAVE TO DELAYED MY

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:29.555
TRANSFER- BECAUSE OF THE-

02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:31.390
UNCERTAINTY WHETHER IN OTHER

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:33.425
THAT UNIVERSITY THAT I WAS

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:34.760
APPLYING WAS GOING TO RE OPEN.

02:10:34.826 --> 02:10:36.595
IN MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DON'T

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:40.966
HAVE THE MEANS TO. WASTE MONEY-

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:44.336
SO WHY GO TO A FOUR YEAR- WHEN

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:46.538
I'M GOING TO WIN THIS DISTANCE

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:47.039
LEARNING WHEN I'M DOING

A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:10:49.942 --> 02:10:52.711

HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:58.844
ACROSS THE STATE. TODAY I'D

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.178
LIKE TO SHARE HOW CSU STUDENTS

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:01.913
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE MANAGED

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.748
TO DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:04.383
PANDEMIC WHILE STILL TRYING TO

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:05.717
ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION AND

02:12:05.784 --> 02:12:08.553
GRADUATE ON TIME. FIRSTLY WE

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:09.454
NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:10.656
STUDENTS HAVE FACED ALL OF THE

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:11.957
SAME CHALLENGES THAT YOU ALL

02:12:12.024 --> 02:12:13.625
HAVE FACED HERE. WETHERBY

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:15.894
ISOLATION ILLNESS OR LOSS OF

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:18.263
FAMILY AND FRIENDS. STUDENTS

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:19.464
ALSO HAD MORE OF A UNIQUE

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:21.900
CHALLENGE WHERE WE HAD TO

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:22.534
STRUGGLE WITH THE TRANSITION TO

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:25.037
ONLINE LEARNING. THIS RESULTED

02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:26.104
IN LEARNING LOSS AND

02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:28.473
PERPETUATED EQUITY GAPS EVEN

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.074
MORE THAN WE COULD'VE IMAGINED

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:32.110
BEFORE. THE PANDEMIC HAS

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:34.046
EXACERBATED OTHER PRE EXISTING

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:36.014
ISSUES AS WELL LIKE MENTAL

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:36.515
HEALTH HOUSING AND FOOD

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:39.451
INSECURITY. NOBODY WAS PREPARED

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:41.520
FOR THIS PANDEMIC NOT THE STATE

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:43.188
NOT THE CSU AND DEFINITELY NOT

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:45.457
OUR STUDENTS. THIS LED TO A

02:12:45.524 --> 02:12:47.359
HUGE SCRAMBLE IN MARCH TWENTY

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:48.327
TWENTY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:49.127
COULD TRANSITION TO BEING

02:12:49.194 --> 02:12:51.163
VIRTUAL. AND IN THE BEGINNING

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:52.030
MOST OF THE EFFORTS WERE

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:53.432
CENTERED AROUND ENSURING

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:54.566
STUDENTS COULD ACCESS THEIR

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:56.501
CLASSES- WHILE THEY'RE ONLINE

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:59.671
AT HOME. CAMPUSES DID THEIR

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:01.039
BEST AT THE TIME TO ADDRESS THE

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:02.708
DIGITAL DIVIDE WEATHER WAS

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:03.842
PROVIDING HOT SPOTS ARE

02:13:03.909 --> 02:13:05.177
CREATING PARTNERSHIP WITH BROAD

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:07.179
BAND- PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:08.046
STUDENTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:09.915
INTERNET. BUT EVEN WITH THOSE

02:13:09.981 --> 02:13:11.983
EFFORTS STUDENTS STRUGGLED AND

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:12.984
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO THIS

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:15.787
DAY- WITH HAVING A STABLE AND

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:16.388
RELIABLE CONNECTION FOR THEIR

02:13:16.455 --> 02:13:18.724
CLASSES. FOR THOSE WITHOUT A

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:20.592
LAPTOP CAMPUSES ALSO PROVIDED

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:22.861
LONERS- AND YOU KNOW THIS WAS

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:23.395
LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF

02:13:23.462 --> 02:13:25.997
CAMPUSES- THE ABOUT A LAPTOP

02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:28.266
THAT CAMPUS HAD- UNFORTUNATELY

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.801
LIKE YOU HEARD EARLIER WITH NEW

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:31.336
PROGRAMS LIKE C. SUCCESS.

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:32.704
FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS

02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:34.473
ARE PROVIDED WITH A TABLET AND

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:36.875
KEYBOARD AND APPLE. PENCIL AND

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:37.943
SO STRIDES ARE BEING MADE TO

02:13:38.009 --> 02:13:39.544
EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE

02:13:39.611 --> 02:13:41.913
HOPING FOR MORE FUNDING. AND IT

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:43.548
CAN HELP US MOVE CLOSE EQUITY

02:13:43.615 --> 02:13:46.451
GAPS MOVING FORWARD. AS YOU ALL

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:47.986
KNOW ALSO SITUATIONS VARY

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.755
GREATLY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS

02:13:49.821 --> 02:13:50.956
AND BUT GENERALLY THERE HAS

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:53.291
BEEN A LACK OF FEELING. OF

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:54.960
SUPPORT AND EMPATHY TO THE

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:57.229
STRUGGLES THAT OUR STUDENTS

02:13:57.295 --> 02:13:57.829
HAVE FACED IN THE LAST TWENTY

02:13:57.896 --> 02:14:00.065
ONE MONTHS. ASSUMPTIONS WERE

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.400
MADE THAT VIRTUAL LEARNING AND

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:03.135
ONLINE COURSES ARE EXACTLY THE

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:04.102
SAME AS THEY WOULD BE IN

02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:05.637
PERSON. AND THAT'S THE FURTHEST

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:08.340
THING FROM THE TRUTH. VIRTUAL

02:14:08.407 --> 02:14:09.941
LEARNING IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.443
AND EVEN TO THIS DAY OUR

02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:13.145
STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:15.847
BURNOUT ENGINE FATIGUE. THERE

02:14:15.914 --> 02:14:17.482
ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGES AS WE ALL

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:19.451
KNOW VERY FIRST HAND BUT I FEEL

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:20.752
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT

02:14:20.819 --> 02:14:22.821
SOME OF THE POSITIVE AS WELL.

02:14:22.888 --> 02:14:24.055
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT STUDENT

02:14:24.122 --> 02:14:25.690
SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE ACADEMIC

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:27.058
ADVISING IN MENTAL HEALTH

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.326
COUNSELLING HAD MOVED TO AN

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:30.862
ONLINE AND NOW A HYBRID MODEL

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:32.564
SO STUDENTS COULD CONTINUE TO

02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:34.466
RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES. BECAUSE

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.134
OF THIS SHIFT MORE STUDENTS ARE

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.636
ABLE TO USE THE SERVICES

02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:38.203
WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL TO

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:41.039
CAMPUS. WHICH IS GREAT AND

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:41.673
MAKES IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR US

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:44.376
ALL. STUDENTS ARE ALSO HAPPY TO

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:45.911
SEE THE CSU TEMPORARILY SUSPEND

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:48.413
THE ACT AND SAT AS EMISSIONS

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:48.847
REQUIREMENTS TO ITS

02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:50.682
UNIVERSITIES. AND HOPE THIS

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:52.717
BECOMES A PERMANENT- HOPE THIS

02:14:52.784 --> 02:14:53.385
BECOMES PERMANENT AYE

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:55.187
STANDARDIZED TESTING POSES

02:14:55.253 --> 02:14:57.756
DOWNSIDE OF EQUITY CONCERNS.

02:14:57.823 --> 02:14:58.857
ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT STUDENTS

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:00.525
OF LIGHT IS THE FLEXIBILITY OF

02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:02.594
ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE COURSES.

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:03.795
THESE COURSES ALLOW FOR

02:15:03.862 --> 02:15:05.564
STUDENTS TO LEARN ON THEIR OWN

02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:08.033
AT THEIR OWN PACE- WHILE

02:15:08.099 --> 02:15:08.500
BALANCING THEIR OTHER

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:10.869
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND STUDENTS

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:12.070
HAVE VOICED THEIR SUPPORT FOR

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:13.738
THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT MAKES A

02:15:13.805 --> 02:15:15.941
DEGREE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. JUST

02:15:16.007 --> 02:15:19.244
BECAUSE THE TIMING AVAILABILITY.

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.812
NOW AS WE CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.147
RETURNING TO CAMPUS STUDENTS

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:23.248
ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE A WORLD

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:25.417
THE VACCINE REQUIREMENTS MASKS

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:27.118
AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CONCERNS.

02:15:27.185 --> 02:15:28.520
WELL THE CSU DOES HAVE A

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:29.955
VACCINE MATTER- REQUIREMENT TO

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:31.690
LOWER THE RISK OF IN NINETEEN

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.325
TRANSITION- TRANSMISSION SORRY

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:35.460
SAFETY IS STILL A BIG CONCERN

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:36.962
FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS.

02:15:37.028 --> 02:15:38.063
STUDENTS ARE FILLED STILL

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.064
FEELING THE IMPACT OF THE

02:15:39.130 --> 02:15:40.232
PANDEMIC AND I STRUGGLING TO

02:15:40.298 --> 02:15:41.399
NAVIGATE RETURNING TO CAMPUS

02:15:41.466 --> 02:15:42.868
WHILE FINDING CHILD CARE.

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:43.969
TAKING CARE OF SICK FAMILY

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:46.538
MEMBERS AND A HUGE VARIANCE IN

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:47.105
GUIDELINES FROM CITY TO CITY

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.174
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. SOMETHING

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:50.709
AS SIMPLE AS PARKING AND

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:52.711
ALREADY INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE

02:15:52.777 --> 02:15:54.045
SERVICE HAS HINDERED STUDENTS

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:56.114
ABILITY TO RETURN TO CAMPUS. SO

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:57.382
FAR ANSWER IS GOING BACK TO

02:15:57.449 --> 02:15:58.550
CAMPUS WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:15:58.617 --> 02:16:02.521
WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK. THE

02:16:02.587 --> 02:16:04.189
PANDEMIC ALSO RESULTED IN JOB

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:05.724
LOSS FOR COUNTLESS STUDENTS AND

02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:06.591
THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ONLY

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:08.260
EXACERBATED. PRE EXISTING

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:10.595
FINANCIAL STRUGGLES AND HINDER

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:11.162
THE STUDENTS ABILITY TO FOR

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:13.431
THEIR DEGREE. MOVING FORWARD

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:14.966
INCREASES AND REFORMS OF

02:16:15.033 --> 02:16:16.635
FINANCIAL AID ARE CRITICAL TO

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:17.602
ENSURING STUDENTS CAN STILL

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.704
GRADUATE- AND THE EQUITY GAPS

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:22.073
ARE ELIMINATED. EMILY AND I

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.942
KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:25.544
SUPPORT FOR BASIC NEEDS IS ALSO

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:26.411
A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF

02:16:26.478 --> 02:16:27.512
RECOVERY AND IT'S IMPORTANT

02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:28.747
THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:29.948
INVEST IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:31.583
FOOD INSECURITY HOMELESSNESS

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:33.618
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS.

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:34.953
INTERNET ACCESS AND TECHNOLOGY

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.988
WILL ALSO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:37.989
THROUGH THE STATE TO ENSURE

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:39.491
THAT STUDENTS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:41.693
IN FUTURE COURSES. REGARDLESS

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:42.327
OF WHAT MENTALITY THEY'RE BEING

02:16:42.394 --> 02:16:45.263
TAUGHT IN. STUDENTS WOULD LIKE

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:46.865
TO CONTINUE TO SEE CHOICES AND

02:16:46.932 --> 02:16:48.466
HOW AND WHERE THEY CAN ATTEND

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:50.035
CLASSES OR RECEIVE SERVICES.

02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:52.404
HAVING OPTIONS- FOR STUDENTS TO

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:53.672
ATTEND EITHER IN PERSON OR

02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:55.307
ONLINE ALLOWS A STUDENT TO HAVE

02:16:55.373 --> 02:16:56.641
THE CHOICE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS

02:16:56.708 --> 02:16:58.076
BEST FOR THEIR LEARNING STYLE

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.978

OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:03.548
RESPONSIBILITIES. IN CONCLUSION

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:04.883
OUR STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.384
OUR STUDENTS AND HIGHER

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:07.919

STRUGGLING. THIS STATE OUR

02:17:13.525 --> 02:17:15.293

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.795
TO MITIGATE THE HORRIBLE IMPACT

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.196
THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD AND I HOPE

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:20.298
THAT WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER.

ON. A YET IN ORDER TO DO SO I

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:29.768
HAD TO BE HONEST WITH MYSELF.

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.302
AND WE NEED TO BE HONEST WITH

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:34.339
OURSELVES. I WHEN WE ALLOCATE

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:35.974
THE BLAME OF LEARNING LOSS AND

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:37.208
EQUITY CHASMS AND HIGHER

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:39.210
EDUCATION HOLY. TO THE

02:18:39.277 --> 02:18:41.646
PANDEMIC. WE AS INSTITUTIONS

02:18:41.713 --> 02:18:43.415
AND INDIVIDUALS HIDE OUR GAZE

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:44.949
FROM THE STARK REALITY WE MUST

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:46.985
ADMIT TO OURSELVES. THE

02:18:47.052 --> 02:18:48.953
PANDEMIC ONLY HIGHLIGHTED AND

02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:51.923
EXAGGERATED ALREADY VISCERAL

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.524
DISPARITIES PRESENT IN HIGHER

UNIVERSITY PRESENT HERE TODAY

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:00.699
KNOWS WE HAVE A FRAGMENT OF

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:03.401
BLAME TO SHARE FOR THIS FACT.

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:04.969
KOPEN NINETEEN BECAUSE THIS ALL

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:07.005
ITS INSTITUTIONS TO IMPARTIALLY

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:08.506
LOOK AT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:10.709
AND ASK ARE WE GIVING EVERYONE

02:19:10.775 --> 02:19:12.711
A FAIR CHANCE- THIS IS A

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:14.846
DIFFICULT QUESTION TO PONDER

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:15.747
WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:17.482
IMPERATIVE- TO CULTIVATE

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:19.384
EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF TRUE

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:22.554
EQUITY. THE CHALLENGE OF

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.355
LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC

02:19:24.422 --> 02:19:26.558
WAS HAVING THE PRESENCE OF MIND

02:19:26.624 --> 02:19:28.727
TO LEARN- MISS SOCIAL UPHEAVAL

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:30.228
AND TAKING ON ADDITIONAL

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:33.431
RESPONSIBILITIES. I STUDENTS WE

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:34.699
WERE ATTENDING CLASSES WITH

02:19:34.766 --> 02:19:36.201
UNEXPLAINABLE AMOUNTS OF

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:37.869
COGNITIVE SHRAPNEL CAUSED BY

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:40.105
SOCIETY AND NECESSARY

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:42.373
ADJUSTMENTS TO ONLINE LEARNING-

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.242
WHILE WE HAD TO ADJUST OUR

02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:46.211
EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILED AT

02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:48.646
TIMES TO JUST WITH US. SOME

02:19:48.713 --> 02:19:49.881
STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO THRIVE

02:19:49.948 --> 02:19:50.915
DURING THE ONLINE ERROR OF

02:19:50.982 --> 02:19:52.650
SCHOOLING- MAINTAIN A STEADY

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:54.085
SCHEDULE EVEN INCREASE THEIR

02:19:54.152 --> 02:19:57.455
GPA. HOWEVER FAR TOO MANY

02:19:57.522 --> 02:20:00.358
STUDENTS SPOKE OF WORKING FORTY

02:20:00.425 --> 02:20:02.393
HOUR WEEKS. BABYSITTING AND

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:05.363
LONG ON TO ZOOM ONLY FOR THE

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:05.897
COURSE MATERIAL TO GO OVER

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:08.333
THEIR HEADS. NOW BY NO MEANS IN

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:10.702
MY SIGNING THE BLAME- TO

02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:12.403
ADMINISTRATORS OR PROFESSORS

02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:14.038
FOR THIS CAUSALITY I NEVER THE

02:20:14.105 --> 02:20:15.406
LESS I BIGGEST ALL TO LOOK

02:20:15.473 --> 02:20:17.108
COMPREHENSIVELY AT THAT JARRING

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:20.512
CONTRAST- ANECDOTES ASIDE ASIDE

02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:21.546
DATA WOULD SUGGEST THAT

02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:23.281
STUDENTS LOGGING FORTY HOUR

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:25.850
WEEKS AND- IN ADDITION TO

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:28.019
EIGHTEEN CREDIT. CLASSES WERE

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.554
PRIMARILY PERSONS OF COLOR. I'M

02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:30.822
MORE ALREADY KNEE DEEP IN

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:33.158
STUDENT LOANS. STUDENTS WHO

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:34.759
MADE THEIR WAY INTO HIGHER

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.694
EDUCATION SYSTEMS- BY SHEER

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:39.264
FORCE OF WILL ONLY FOR THE RUG

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:42.000
TO BE PULLED UP ANYTHING. THE

02:20:42.066 --> 02:20:43.635
MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF THIS

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.103
PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.838
EVEN BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THE

02:20:46.905 --> 02:20:48.173
STUDENTS HAD THEIR BACKS TO THE

02:20:48.239 --> 02:20:50.241
WALL FINANCIALLY. OF THE

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:52.043
PANDEMIC FORCE THESE DARK SHOES

02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:55.713
INTO THE OPEN. HOWEVER THERE

02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:57.982
STOOD A BRILLIANT FEW- WHO

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:58.950
ACTED AS A LIGHT BEARS IN THIS

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:00.985
DARKNESS THOSE WHO WISH TO SEE

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.954
STUDENTS SUCCEED REGARDLESS OF

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.956
SOCIETAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.424
ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

02:21:06.491 --> 02:21:08.827
PROFESSORS FACULTY AND STAFF

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:10.195
WHO STOOD IN THE GAP FOR

02:21:10.261 --> 02:21:11.729
STUDENTS WHEN THEY COULD NOT

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:14.365
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. AT TIMES

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:15.667
NUMEROUS PROFESSORS SHIFTED

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.402
THEIR ENTIRE LESSON PLANS AND

02:21:17.468 --> 02:21:19.404
LEARNING OUTCOMES TO FACILITATE

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:21.372
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE-

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:24.275
CONDUCIVE TO STUDENT SUCCESS.

02:21:24.342 --> 02:21:25.977
WEATHER WAS INCORPORATING-

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:27.512
EXPERIENCE- WHETHER IT WAS

02:21:27.579 --> 02:21:29.280
INCORPORATING MORE ASYNCHRONOUS

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:31.149
CLASSES GIVING STUDENTS THE

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:33.251
ABILITY TO GO AHEAD OR

02:21:33.318 --> 02:21:34.619
EXTENDING GRACE TO STUDENTS

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:36.754
WITH LIFE ALTERING-

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:37.322
CIRCUMSTANCES ON A PERSONAL

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:40.825
LEVEL. THESE INDIVIDUALS GAVE

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:43.161
HOPE WHEN IT WAS IN LOW SUPPLY.

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.562
ON A UNIVERSITY LEVEL I CAN

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:46.698
SPEAK PERSONALLY TO- LAST YEAR

02:21:46.764 --> 02:21:48.433
AS WELLNESS DEPARTMENT REMOVING

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:49.567
THE LIMIT OF COUNSELING

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.736
SESSIONS ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS

02:21:51.803 --> 02:21:53.037
AND TRANSITIONING THE ENTIRE

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.873
DEPARTMENT ONLINE IN ORDER TO

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:56.808
MEET THE READILY APPARENT NEED

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.843
FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT.

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:00.411
DECISIONS LIKE BEES MADE THE

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:01.913
TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.615
EASIER WHEN EVERYTHING IN THE

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.216
WORLD SUGGESTED DESPAIR WAS THE

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:07.752
ONLY AVAILABLE OPTION. MY

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:09.520
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER IS

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:11.189
ONE I'LL CARRY WITH ME TO ALL

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:12.790
MY FUTURE ENDEAVORS- BECAUSE

02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:14.225
BEFORE THE CALL THE NINETEEN

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:15.860
PANDEMIC I SERVED AS A

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:16.995
RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT IN THE

02:22:17.061 --> 02:22:19.097
DORM. AND DURING THE RISE-

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:20.965
DURING THE PANDEMIC I SERVED AS

02:22:21.032 --> 02:22:21.766
A STUDENT DEAN FOR THE

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:24.302
RESIDENCE HALL- AS AN RA I WAS

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:25.270
PART OF THE TEAM THAT

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:26.804
FACILITATED THE MASSIE

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:29.040
TRANSITION IN CLEARING OUT THE

02:22:29.107 --> 02:22:30.742
DORMS. IN LESS THAN A WEEK-

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:31.976
THERE WAS AN INHERENTLY

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:33.945
HARROWING NATURE TO TELLING

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.280
STUDENTS TO PACK THEIR

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:37.815
BELONGINGS. AND NOT BEING ABLE

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:38.449
TO CONFIDENTLY TELL THEM WHEN

02:22:38.516 --> 02:22:41.019
THEY BE BACK- I REMEMBER

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:42.320
CONSOLING INTERNATIONAL

02:22:42.387 --> 02:22:44.022
RESIDENTS WHO WERE UNSURE WHEN

02:22:44.088 --> 02:22:44.622
THEY WOULD SEE THEIR FAMILIES

02:22:44.689 --> 02:22:46.591
AGAIN- DUE TO TRAVEL

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:48.092
RESTRICTIONS. I REMEMBER

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:49.327
REASSURING STUDENTS WITH

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:50.862
UNHEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENTS

02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:51.996
AT HOME THAT THEY WOULD

02:22:52.063 --> 02:22:53.698
PREVAIL. THAT WE WOULD SEE EACH

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:56.434
OTHER AGAIN- AS A STUDENT IN

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:57.835
YOUR ONE OF THE PANDEMIC I

02:22:57.902 --> 02:22:59.470
RECALL COUNTLESS PEERS TELLING

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:00.972
ME THEY CAN'T AFFORD COLLEGE

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:03.875
ANYMORE DUE TO THEM HAVING TO

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:04.475
PICK UP MORE WORK SINCE THEIR

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:06.311
PARENT WAS LAID OFF. ALL THIS

02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:08.146
BEING SAID- MY PERSPECTIVE

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.647
DURING THE PANDEMIC ALSO

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:11.916
GRANTED ME INSIGHT. INTO THE

02:23:11.983 --> 02:23:13.484
INGENUITY AND RESILIENCE OF THE

02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:16.087
MODERN STANDARD. I SAW STUDENTS

02:23:16.154 --> 02:23:18.289
FIND THEIR VOICE APPEARS TO

02:23:18.356 --> 02:23:20.792
REALIZE THAT THEIR VOICES CAN

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:21.392
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN JOINED

02:23:21.459 --> 02:23:23.428
TOGETHER. OF THE PANDEMIC

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:25.730
SHOWED ME A GLIMPSE OF HOPE FOR

02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:28.933
WHAT MY GENERATION CAN AND WILL

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:29.467
ACCOMPLISH IF WE STAY THE

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:32.070
COURSE. THE PANDEMIC SHOWED US

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.805
ALL THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.707
TO BE RADICALLY INTENTIONAL IN

02:23:35.773 --> 02:23:38.176
CHANGING SYSTEMS IF. WE ALLOW

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:39.510
OURSELVES TO THINK BEYOND

THE EQUITY GAP IN EDUCATION-

THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE. I

02:23:52.623 --> 02:23:53.858
CAN ALWAYS THIS IS NOT AN EASY

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:57.161
TASK- BUT IT IS A NECESSARY ONE.

02:23:57.228 --> 02:23:58.997

THE SAME EXACT RESULTS. ARE

RECOVERY AND RESTORATION WILL

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:07.005
REQUIRE RE EXAMINATION AND

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:08.973
AUTHENTIC ANALYSIS OF

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.209
UNIVERSITY POLICY AND WHOM IT

02:24:11.275 --> 02:24:13.211
MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT. SHUTTING

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:15.146
THE DOOR TO PANDEMIC INEQUALITY

02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:16.914
IN EDUCATION WILL REQUIRE

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:18.983
MONUMENTAL STEPS LIKE EXTENDING

STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:30.561
RECOVERY WILL REQUIRE TIME. IT

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:32.897

COLLEGES- I HAVE TALKED TO MY

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:27.218

KNOW IT'S JUGGLING THE-

02:25:34.826 --> 02:25:36.828
CONTAMINATED EIFFEL BECAUSE

02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:38.663
MOST OF MOST OF THE STUDENTS

02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:40.064
SO. THAT THE COMMUNITY

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:41.899
COLLEGES- FROM MAJORITY

02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:45.236
MAJORITY OUR ADULT POPULATION

02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:47.538
AND THEN ALSO ATTENDING THE

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:52.143
CLASSES SO BUT THE- I'VE BEEN

02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:56.247
I'VE BEEN THINKING. SOME STILL

02:25:56.314 --> 02:25:58.049
SOME UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE

02:25:58.116 --> 02:26:02.887
BEEN OPERATING- ESPECIALLY

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:05.690
AFTER HIGHER LEARNING EDUCATION

02:26:05.756 --> 02:26:16.968
ON ON OUR WAY BEFORE. THIS

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:21.239
FUNDAMENTAL. I IN MOST PART IF

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:24.208
NOT ELEMENTARY LEVEL LONG

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:30.214
ENOUGH- I'M NOT LOADING AND-

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:34.085
USED TO THE ONLINE LEARNING.

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.820
AND THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:41.025
PLAN- ONE OF YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:42.793
THE ONE NINE LOOTING FOR MYSELF

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.962
LESS ABILITY AND I DON'T HOLD

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:47.031
YOUR OWN PAYS OUT AND TAKING

02:26:47.098 --> 02:26:49.267
CARE OF ALL. IN ALL HOUSE

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:51.169
CHORES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:52.370
WHEN YOU HAVE TIME AT THE

02:26:52.436 --> 02:26:54.038
EVENING TIMES YOU CAN OPEN UP A

02:26:54.105 --> 02:26:55.406
CAN MONNING STILL NOT WELL

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:57.008
ATTENDED TO SAY EVEN THOUGHT

02:26:57.074 --> 02:27:01.812
THERE ARE SOME. OF THE PROBLEMS.

02:27:01.879 --> 02:27:03.181
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THE- I'VE

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:08.152
BEEN THINKING. IF IN THE FUTURE

02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:12.657
IF WE CAN- BUT VALUES TO

02:27:12.723 --> 02:27:18.729
TECHNOLOGY. AND MANY MINUS. THE

02:27:18.796 --> 02:27:23.301
DIFFICULTIES OF ONLINE LEARNING.

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:25.403
AMADOR SAID IMPROVE WHAT THE

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:29.674
TECHNOLOGY- FOR ONLINE LEARNING.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:33.010
AND NOT. TOTALLY ELIMINATE THE

02:27:33.077 --> 02:27:35.646
COLLEGE CAMPUSES DO YOU THINK

02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:39.350
OF AS A PHYSICAL IDEA. WELL LET

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:40.818
THE STUDENT CENTER THAT WOULD

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:42.253
BE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD A

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.621
GREAT POINT VICE CHAIR TO AYE

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:44.956
AYE I'M JOHN I'M NOT SURE THAT

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:46.691
THAT WOULD WORK FOR ALL OF OUR

02:27:46.757 --> 02:27:48.926
MAJORS AND PROGRAMS THOUGH- I

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.561
THINK THE BENEFIT OF ONLINE

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:51.495
LEARNING IS THAT IT PROVIDES

02:27:51.562 --> 02:27:53.497
THE FLEXIBILITY. TO THE PEOPLE

02:27:53.564 --> 02:27:54.699
WHOSE LEARNING STYLE THAT

02:27:54.765 --> 02:27:58.469
ONLINE LEARNING- MEETS. HOWEVER

02:27:58.536 --> 02:27:59.370
THERE ARE CERTAIN STUDENTS WHO

02:27:59.437 --> 02:28:01.138
HAVE A HARD TIME LEARNING IF

02:28:01.205 --> 02:28:02.673
THEY'RE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.475
AND I'VE SEEN ON MY CAMPUS I

02:28:04.542 --> 02:28:05.343
WALKED AROUND SOME OF THE

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:07.178
BUILDINGS AND THERE'S A LIFE

02:28:07.245 --> 02:28:09.614
SIZE DUMMIES AND DOLLS OF FOR

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.115
NURSING PROGRAMS THAT. THEY

02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:12.984
TERRIFY ME BUT THEY NEED THAT

02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:15.253
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE- ONCE THEY

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:17.088
GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR TO THE

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:19.390
FACILITY TO WORK SO. I THINK

02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:20.758
FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WORKS FOR

02:28:20.825 --> 02:28:22.226
WE SHOULD LET IT WORK FOR THEM

02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:23.594
AND FOR THE REST OF US AND THEN

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:24.328
FOR THE REST OF THE OTHER

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:25.930
STUDENTS THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:29.433
SPACE TO RETURN TO CAMPUS

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:29.900
WHETHER THAT'S NOW OR-

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:31.836
EVENTUALLY. IN ONE EXAMPLE I

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.137
THOUGHT THE- ONLY ONE OF THE

02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:36.207
MORE DIFFICULT TO STUDY IS SO-

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:40.511
THE- OF THE DISCIPLINE OF

02:28:40.578 --> 02:28:41.946
THROUGH ONLINE LEARNING WITH

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:43.881
THE NURSING BECAUSE A

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:45.750
NOURISHING ORDER ORDER HAVE TO

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:48.586
SHOW DEMONSTRATE THAT OFF IN A

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:50.054
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY AND

02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:52.857
THE HOW TO INTERACT WITH THE

02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:53.324
PATIENTS OR WHATEVER.

02:28:53.391 --> 02:28:57.728
SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH- MY- OUR

02:28:57.795 --> 02:29:00.398
DAUGHTER IN ALL. HAS BEEN

02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:04.435
ENROLLED IN ONE CLASS AT

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:05.269
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. IN

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:08.372
NOURISHING AND THE NEXT MONTH

02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:11.842
SUCH AS CAN I GET THE DOCTORATE

02:29:11.909 --> 02:29:14.011
DEGREE IN NURSING-

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:17.014
PRACTITIONERS- DISCIPLINE AND

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:17.481
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

02:29:17.548 --> 02:29:19.517
CONGRATULATE. AND THAT DOESN'T

02:29:19.583 --> 02:29:23.888
ACCEPT FOR IF A NURSING CAN BE.

02:29:23.954 --> 02:29:26.691
ARCHTOP ONLINE HOW COME THEY

02:29:26.757 --> 02:29:28.926
DON'T REST OF THE- SUBJECTS I'M

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.561
SURE THAT THE SOMETHING

02:29:30.628 --> 02:29:32.263
SOMETHING CLASS TO SOME.

02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:35.499
INVOLVE OUR LAB WORK ETCETERA

02:29:35.566 --> 02:29:36.967
SO. I THINK THAT THAT CAN

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:39.870
SOFTEN MASTABA ISSUES HAS TO

02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:41.939
ADDRESS US SUBJECT TO I GUESS

02:29:42.006 --> 02:29:44.709
UP EDUCATIONAL EXPERT EXPLOSIVE

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.644
TO RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENT

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:47.978
EXPERIMENT THE WEATHER THAT

02:29:48.045 --> 02:29:49.280
WILL PROVIDE THE MORE

02:29:49.347 --> 02:29:51.148
CONVENIENT SELF ASSURANCE UP TO

02:29:51.215 --> 02:29:54.151
LEARN. AND IS A STRONGER TO

02:29:54.218 --> 02:29:56.454
PARKER THEY'LL PAY PARKING FEES

02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:59.957
AND THE CHILD CARE BY A- ON A

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:01.692
FULL IN PERSON RUNNING ON

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.928
CAMPUS HAS A LOT OF A DRAWBACK

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.062
TO SO I THINK THAT'S THE ONE

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:07.064
AREA I'M THINKING WE CAN WE

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:12.636
SHOULD EXPLORE. THAT'S A JUST A

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:15.239
COMMENT. IF MAY MATCH IT IF I

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.140
COULD ADD A DO ALSO BELIEVE IT

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:18.376
IS A- INSTANCE OF BOTH AND IT

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:19.977
REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE-

02:30:20.044 --> 02:30:21.512
EITHER OR BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:23.481
THOSE WONDERFUL STORIES OF

02:30:23.547 --> 02:30:24.815
PROGRAMS BEING ABLE TO ADJUST

02:30:24.882 --> 02:30:26.217
AND STILL BE AFFECTED IN THEIR

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:28.753
LEARNING OUTCOMES- HOWEVER

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:30.054
THERE ARE. YOU KNOW ON THE FLIP

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:31.889
SIDE SO FOR INSTANCE LAST YEAR

02:30:31.956 --> 02:30:33.190
I WAS DOING MY RESEARCH

02:30:33.257 --> 02:30:34.892
SEQUENCE FOR MY METHODS AND

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:37.328
RESEARCH STATISTICS COURSE. AND

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:39.196
IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO A

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:41.799
STUDY ONLINE- ONLY BECAUSE YOU

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:43.834
MISS OUT ON SO MUCH IN PERSON

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:46.270
RECRUITING- HOWEVER. WE WERE

02:30:46.337 --> 02:30:48.205
ABLE TO PUT THE SURVEY ONLINE

02:30:48.272 --> 02:30:49.807
AND RECRUIT THROUGH THAT AND WE

02:30:49.874 --> 02:30:51.041
GOT A DECENT AMOUNT OF

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:53.277
PARTICIPANTS SO. I THINK WE

02:30:53.344 --> 02:30:54.745
SHOULD AND CAN KEEP BOTH

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:56.547
SYSTEMS AND THEY CAN STILL BE

02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:58.883
EFFECTIVE AND WE SHOULD. BUT

02:30:58.949 --> 02:31:00.684
THAT THAT WOULD BE MY TAKE ON

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:03.154
IT THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WANT

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:04.889
