GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR WILL BE DEEMED READ MESSAGES FROM THE ASSEMBLY WILL BE DEEMED READ REPORTS OF COMMITTEE WILL BE DEEMED RED AND AMENDMENTS ADOPTED MEMBERS WERE MOVING TO MOTIONS RESOLUTIONS AND NOTICES I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT A RECOGNIZED META PRO TEM SENATOR ATKINS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD REQUEST UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO TAKE UP SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EIGHTY TWO WITHOUT REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE OR FILE. IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING UNANIMOUS CONSENT. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. MRS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EIGHTY TWO BY SENATOR ATKINS RELATIVE TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CURRENT RULES OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO REGULAR SESSIONS. CENTER ACTIONS COLLEAGUES. S. C. R. EIGHTY TWO WILL ADOPT THE JOINT RULES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SESSION. TRADITIONALLY THE TWO HOUSES UP JOINT RULES TO STANDARDIZE MANY PROCESSES BETWEEN OUR TWO HOUSES. DURING SOME SESSIONS THE TWO HOUSES DON'T REACH AN AGREEMENT AND WE OPERATE USING CUSTOM AND PRACTICE. BUT IT IS THE BEST PRACTICE TO ADOPT NEW JOINT RULES WITH SOME REGULARITY. THE RULES IN S. C. R. EIGHTY TO R. SENSUALLY THE SAME IN MOST RESPECTS AS PASSED SENATE RULES AND TRADITIONS. BUT AMONG THE CHANGES TO THE JOINT RULES ARE USING GENDER NEUTRAL TERMINOLOGY. CLARIFYING THAT BILL HEARINGS CAN BE HELD IN THE- STREET BUILDING NOT JUST THE CAPITAL. MODERNIZING OUR BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS TO ALLOW GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND INPUT. CODIFYING OUR LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES THERE ARE SOME OTHER MINOR CHANGES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR SENATE RULES. SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM- PROTEST MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. OH SORRY SENATOR NELSON AND MATTER PRESENT LATE MARTIN AND I COULDN'T SEE IT. SENATOR NELSON AND THEN SENATOR WILK. META PRESENTATIONS ON THE SENATE THIS IS A RARE OCCASION FOR ME BUT I WILL OPPOSE THESE RULE CHANGES. IN MANY WAYS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE HAVE SEEN DELIBERATE ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DIMINISH PUBLIC INPUT IN THE PROCESS. ALTHOUGH MOST EGREGIOUS IS THE PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH IS VIRTUALLY A JOKE. PEOPLE GET THE CALL IN AND SAY I'M JANE I LIKE IT- BILL AND I DON'T THAT'S NOT PUBLIC INPUT PLEASED THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THIS YEAR WE CAN HIT ROCK BOTTOM BUT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BEFORE FOR A YEAR TO. BUT I THINK IT'S UNWIELDY. I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL. IT SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE DIFFERENCES. IN THE TWO SEPARATE VERSIONS OF THE BUDGET. NOT NECESSARILY A FREE FOR ALL. EVEN NASH STRUCTURALLY HOW THE BUILDING WORKS NOW. THE CITIZENS HAVE LESSER INPUT. INDEED THIS INSTITUTION. I THINK SOME OF IT MAY WELL BE BY DESIGN I DO NOT ACCUSE NOT NECESSARILY THESE RULES ARE SUCH AN EXERCISE. BUT TO STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THEN JUST STEP THAT MAKES THE SENATE. MUCH MORE CAN. THE CONDUCT AN OPERATION OF THE ASSEMBLY. AND THAT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT BOON OVER THE DECADES IN THIS INSTITUTION. WE'VE HAD SENATE RULES WITHOUT ASSEMBLY RULES. WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE THOUGH THAT'S DIFFERENT THAT'S BEEN SENATORIAL COURTESY. THAT'S BEEN SOMEWHAT PRESERVED. MY LAST DAY HERE I MAY SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS AGAIN GONE EIGHTEEN AND I CAME BACK AND PEOPLE SAY JIM WHAT'S DIFFERENT. WELL I SAID IT'S SOCIETAL IT IS NOT JUST. IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER AND RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION AND ITS RULES HAVE GREATLY DIMINISHED. I BEMOAN THAT AND IN PART BECAUSE OF THAT I WILL VOTE NO ON THESE RULES. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR WILK I DO APOLOGIZE BUT YOUR MICROPHONE WAS RIGHT IN THE DARK PART OF YOUR SUIT AND I CANNOT SEE YOU BUT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. MY NUMBER TEN WHEN YOU TAKE A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M JUST INTERESTED ON FIFTEEN MONTHS INTO THE SESSION WHY WE HAVE TO WAR FOR THIS TO THE FLOOR I'M NOT I I'D LIKE TO KNOW. THE THINKING OF WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE REGULAR PROCESS MEMBER TIM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. IT HAS BEEN OUR DESIRE TO GET THE JOINT RULES- DONE OF COURSE BEFORE NOW- IT'S A NEGOTIATION WITH THE ASSEMBLY THERE WERE SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES. ARE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO WORK WITH HIM IN TERMS OF COMMITTEE SELECTIONS WHO CHAIRS WHAT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY OR THE- SENATE. WE NEGOTIATED- AT SOME POINT- WE REALIZE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE RULES IN PLACE WHILE WE DO HAVE SENATE RULES- WE NOW HAVE A SECOND BUILDING- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. THE ASSEMBLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WE AGREED ON IN THE JOINT RULES WAS FOR EXAMPLE. HOLDING HEARINGS IN THE- STREET BUILDING SO- THERE WAS NO EFFORT NOT TO GET THEM DONE THERE WAS A CONTINUED EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE ON SOME ITEMS THAT WE FELT ARE I FELT. AND WE FELT WOULD GIVE THE SENATE- MAYBE- I'M SURE IT DIPLOMATICALLY LET ME SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE OUR BALANCE IN TERMS OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IF YOU SERVE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE. AND A NUMBER OF MEMBERS IN THIS HOUSE SERVE ON THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE BETWEEN THE HOUSES. AND SO THE ADDITIONAL TIME WE TOOK ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC AND WE PASSED RULS OF THE SENATE. THAT REFLECTED SOME EMERGENCY MEASURES THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE AND BE ABLE TO PIVOT AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SENATE. WE REALLY WANTED TO PUSH AND TRY TO GET SOME MORE AGREEMENTS WITH THE ASSEMBLY ON OTHER THINGS BUT AT THIS POINT- IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO HAVE JOINT RULES SO. WE DIDN'T RUSH BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO GET MORE THINGS DONE BUT WE WERE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC AND WE STILL ARE WE WILL SEE HOW. WE CONTINUE TO FARE. ON AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT MONTH AS THESE CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED SO. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM SENATOR WILK I THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME. NEVER REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY WERE WORKING IT- WHEN WE'VE BEEN FIFTEEN MONTHS INTO THIS HI HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD SAY- LOG. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THESE THINGS WE NEED TO BE UPDATED HAVE NOPE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WHY DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM HOWEVER IS I HAVE SERVED AS VICE CHAIR OF RULES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN VICE CHAIR OF RULES IN THE SENATE. IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY IT'S A COMPLETE JOKE ALL THE POWER IS IN THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE AND THERE'S NO CLAPPER COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AT ALL ONE OF THINGS THAT I VALUE ABOUT THIS AND IT IS WORKING COLLABORATIVE LEE AND THE RULES COMMITTEE IN MY TIME THERE I REALLY ENJOYED IT. FELT LIKE THE MINORITY HAD INPUT- THIS IS TAKING A LOT OF PROVISIONS AND PUTTING IT IN THE OFFICE OF THE PROTEST I VERY MUCH LIKE A RESPECT OUR CURRENT PRO TEM BUT SHE'S NOT GOING TO ALWAYS BE PRO TEM. I HAVE A REAL CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU BUT AT LEAST BY MEMBERS TO VOTE NO ON THE RULE CHANGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WELL. SIR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JENNIFER I JUST BROUGHT RISE IN SUPPORT- AND JUST A BIASING CALLING. FROM TO HEMA- THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE DESPITE BEING HERE FOR. MY TENTH YEAR NOW ELEVEN SOMETHING. UP IT'S MY FIRST TIME SERVING ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT COME IN WITH OUR OUR NEW. WAY OF DOING THAT I THINK EXPANDS THE REACH. TO THE PUBLIC AND WE'RE IN WAYS THAT WE NEVER DREAMED OF BEFORE I KNOW. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SPEND MY BIRTHDAY AND BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS LAST THURSDAY. AND OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE CALLED TO WISH ME A HAPPY BIRTHDAY. DURING A PUBLIC COMMENT SO I CAN JUST WANT TO JUST WANT TO. INSURE THAT THE PUBLIC'S MIND THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DO WORK AND I THINK PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE OUR TELEPHONIC SYSTEMS. LONG AFTER. WE ARE WE ARE ALL BACK. AND WITH OUR OUR LOVELY SMILING FACES AS A WAY. TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC COMMENT INTO OUR PROCESS THANK YOU. THE USER EDMUNDSON HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE A- I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN MANY OF THESE VARIOUS CAPACITIES AND HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO SHE- THESE TYPES OF JOINT RULES IN THE PAST AND THE CHALLENGES FACING THE HOUSES. IS QUITE DELICATE AND- I CURRENTLY SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRO TEM IS THE VICE CHAIR REPRESENTING THE SENATE ON THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD MY VOICE. TO THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND I KNOW THERE'S OFTEN ISSUES BACK AND FORTH BUT AGAIN THESE ARE HARD THINGS TO DO AND I THINK THAT THE PRO TEM AND THE TEAM HAS REALLY STRUCK AN INTELLIGENT BALANCE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SHOW- ESSERE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR WIENER I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THESE RULES AND I SEE THIS THERE ARE SOME GOOD MODERNIZATION CHANGES IN HIS ROLES AS A SENATOR FROM STOCKTON MENTION ANOTHER ONE- IS THE ABILITY TO BE MUCH MORE NIMBLE WHEN A MEMBER IS OUT FOR EXAMPLE SEX- NOT BEING SHORT HANDED ON A COMMITTEE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PUT THE POTEMKIN PUT A REPLACEMENT MEMBER ON THAT COMMITTEE- WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE CENTER I WAS TOLD BY MY SUPERSTAR. THAT IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING FOR LET'S SAY A FIVE PERSON COMMITTEE AND SOMEONE AT THE LAST MINUTE GET SACKED THIS IS GOING TO BE A VACANCY ON THAT COMMITTEE AND YOUR BILL MIGHT DIE FOR BECAUSE WE'RE SHORT ONE MEMBER ON A SMALL COMMITTEE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE UNLIKE THE ASSEMBLY WE HAD A VERY MORE ALIVE OR PROCESS TO ACTUALLY REPLACE A MEMBER BURLY PARTICULARLY WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF I GET SICK AT THE LAST MINUTE. AND THIS IS OUR LEADER PRO TEM THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THESE COMMITTEES ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND FULLY STAFFED AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT CHANGE OCCURS AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER CORTESE. OF THANK YOU MAYOR OF. MADAM I WANTED TO CHIME IN- IN AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND I'VE BEEN HERE- JUST A SHORT THIRTEEN MONTHS AND I'VE ALREADY HAD AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS TO. TO PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE THE NEED. FOR THE- FOR A PRO TEM TO BE ABLE TO- TO APPOINT. SOMEBODY ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE- TO KEEP THE BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES- I THINK GOING FORWARD- PANDEMIC OR NOT WE NEVER KNOW WHAT CHALLENGES THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT FACE IN. AND WHY A MEMBER CAN'T BE HERE FOR SESSION- OR WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS FOR SOMEBODY. TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A QUORUM PRESENT. THERE BEEN NUMEROUS INSTANCES WHERE WE FOUND OUT THAT A MEMBERS UNABLE TO CHEER- AS A SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO JUST SAID. WITH VERY SHORT NOTICE- IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN ONE AHEAD. BUT WHAT ELSE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO- WITH THE URGENCY OF THE BUSINESS TRYING TO GET BILLS OUT ON TIME- HEAD. OF OUR PRO TEM NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE- A SUDDEN. ABOUT APPROPRIATE MOVE ONE EMPHASIZE. THAT THIS. RULE DOESN'T REMOVE THE RULES COMMITTEE FROM CONSIDERING APPOINTMENTS UNDER TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE DONE. MERELY PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY IN THOSE EXIGENT URGENT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE PROTEIN TO DO SO WHEN SUCH SITUATIONS ARISE IN MACON AND FEASIBLE. THE CONVENE THE RULES COMMITTEE UNDER SHORT NOTICE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MATTER PRESIDENT. AND I'D URGE AND I VOTE. ON THESE RULES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE'S SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. I AM SECRETARY EXCUSE ME MADAM HOTEL YOU MAY CLOSE. MAN PRESIDENT THANK YOU AND TO MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR DISCOURSE AND COMMENTS. I WOULD MAKE ONLY A COUPLE OF POINTS- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WE ARE GOING INTO TWO- TO THE POINT THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON MADE. AS WE'RE GETTING FURTHER INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS WITH MORE AT STAKE AND MORE RESOURCES. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE CHANGES REFLECTED IN THESE ROLES ARE GOING TO ALLOW FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MORE PARTICIPATION. ON PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE WAS PASSED AND THEN FOLLOWING UP THAT THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE. IT REALLY JAMMED THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAD TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND OF COURSE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HAD A PANDEMIC. I AND FEWER ABILITIES TO HAVE THE EXTENSIVE HEARING PROCESS IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THAT WE WANT THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT- LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUE AND- I FROM SANTA CLARITA. MY APOLOGIES- WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE IS. WHAT WE HAVE AS OUR- IT AT OUR DISPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE SOMETHING QUICKLY SO TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN ADVANCE OF DEEPER DISCUSSIONS FOR THE BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO APPOINT AS NEED BE. I APPRECIATE AND I WILL SAY THE RULES ARE DONE EVERY TWO YEAR SESSION THE SENATE RULES HAVE TO BE APPROVED THE JOINT ROLES ARE DO NOT HAVE TO BE DONE AS OFTEN BUT THE DESIRE IS TO DO THAT. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO THAT NOW I WILL ALSO LASTLY SAY- I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT I PREFER- THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE GO THROUGH THE RULES COMMITTEE I'VE SERVED WITH. A NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE RULES COMMITTEE WHEN I CAME INTO THE SENATE I WAS ON THE RULES COMMITTEE WITH MADAM PRESIDENT. OUR PRESIDING TODAY. AND I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH OUR FOUR DIFFERENT VICE CHAIRS WHICH ARE FROM THE OTHER. PARTY AND I THINK- IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESPECT THE RULES AND THE RULES COMMITTEE. AND BECAUSE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE FLOOR I REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT I BELIEVE COLLEGIALITY IS IMPORTANT I BELIEVE THE RESPECT TO EVERY MEMBER. ANNA IS IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF PARTY. AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRACTICE IN THAT REGARD BUT I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TO GET THESE JOINT ROLLS PAST. AND ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL.
