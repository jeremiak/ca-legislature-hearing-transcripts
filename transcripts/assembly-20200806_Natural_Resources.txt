I'M PUSHING THE ONLY BUTTON I HOP WAIT OKAY ONE MORE TESTING GOT IT THERE YOU GO WELL LET ME. REPEAT MY THANK YOUS TO YOU MADAM CHAIR- FOR LETTING ME GIVE ME THE COURTESY TO GO FIRST I APPRECIATE IT A GREAT DEAL SO MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT SB NINE NINE FIVE WHICH EXTENDS THE SUNSET OF EXISTING CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OR SEQUESTERING MINING PROVISIONS AND ENABLE SMALL SCALE HOUSING PROJECTS TO BENEFIT FROM THE STREAMLINING AS WE- THAT'S BEEN. NINE FIVE AS PART THE WORK DONE ON A HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE OF BILLS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPLY. AND PRODUCTION IN OUR STATE. I WANT TO THANK THE GROUP OF LEAD SENATORS ARE SENATORS MCGUIRE WHO IS. WITH ME TODAY AND WILL BE COMMENTING AND- HERE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AS THE LEADER OF THE GROUP. ALONG WITH SENATORS CABALLERO DIRECTED TO SORROW. TO ROSS SO- GONZALEZ HILL ROTH AND RUBIO THEY STEPPED UP TO LEAD THE DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF YOU MADAM CHAIR- YOUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MR CHIU ASSEMBLY HOUSING CHAIR REGARDING THE LEGISLATION THE ASSEMBLY HAS PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. SB NINE NINE FIVE IS A KEY PART OF THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS. IN THAT IT ENSURE SMALL SCALE HOUSING PROJECTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AB NINE HUNDRED PROGRAM RELIEF. AND IT PUTS IN PLACE TOOLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONDUCT-MORE EFFICIENT SEQUEL REVIEWS. BY UTILIZING THE MASTER AND FOCUSED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. FOR THE POLICY WALKS IN THE ROOM TO ME I ARE IN THE FEI ARE PROCESS. FIRST I WANT TO. ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT DO THE FOLLOWING. INCORPORATE A STATUTORY DEFINITION OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE NEW STREAMLINING PROVISIONS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS BETWEEN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARSAND A HUNDRED MILLION. IT CLAY IF. LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THE NEW STANDARDS IN THE BILL WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW PROJECTS AT OR ABOVE THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD. BUT RETAIN THE CURRENT BILL PROVISIONS FOR THE HOUSING PROJECTS BELOW THE THRESHOLD. AND ABOVE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. FURTHER TO ADDRESS GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION ISSUES THE FIRST PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO MITIGATION THAT PROVIDES DIRECT ONSITE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. IF THAT IS NOT FEASIBLE MITIGATION MUST PROVIDE LOCALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA. IT ALL IF OFFSETS ARE USE THE FIRST PRIORITY FOR OFFSETS WOULD BE ONES THAT AR ON SITE. OR IN THE SAME COMMUNITY AS THE PROPOSED PROJECT IF THAT IS NOT FEASIBLE OFFSETS MUST BE IN SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES OR THE OFFSETS MUST PROVIDE LOCALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA. FURTHER AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT IF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE PROJECT IS LOCATED HAS AN INCLUSIONARY ZONING ORDINANCE. THAT ORDINANCE WOULD PREVAIL AND GOVERN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STANDARD REQUIRED IN THE BILL. FURTHER pEXPRESSLY STATING THE SEQUEL ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE FOR PROJECTS WILL BE THE SAME AS UNDER SEQUEL GUIDELINES AS THEY EXIST TODAY. FURTHER ADDS LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THAT BOTH SUPERIOR AND APPELLATE COURT COSTS WILL BE PAID BY THE APPLICANT. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN HER INCREDIBLE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVING. THE AB NINE HUNDRED PROGRAM. AS A MANY- RECALL IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB NINE HUNDRED THAT ESTABLISHED. A NEW PROCESS UNDER SEQUEL TO STREAMLINE COULD MEAN RECORD PAPERWORK. AN EXPEDITED LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR LARGE MULTI BENEFIT HOUSING CLEAN ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING PROJECTS THAT HAVE A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AB NINE HUNDRED SUNSETS ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS BILL EXTENDS AB NINE HUNDRED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IT EXPERIENCE IT SO THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO MUCH SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS. AND THIS IS REALLY SO THAT ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF THIS TOOL NOT JUST THE LARGER CITIES BUT RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. FOR CURRENT AB NINE HUNDRED LAW NOW SAYS ONLY PROJECTS OF A HUNDRED MILLION AS I SAID. SB NINE NINE FIVE LOWERED THAT THRESHOLD TO FIFTEEN MILLION SO THAT THOSE SMALLER HOUSING PROJECTS QUALIFY. LIKEWISE THE BILL REQUIRES. THAT HOUSING PROJECTS HAVE AT LEAST 15% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE REQUIRED IN STATE LAW TODAY. AND TODAY AB NINE HUNDRED HAS RESULTED IN AT LEAST FOURTEEN SEPARATE MEGA PROJECTS REPRESENTING ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT OUR STATE. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH. THESE PROJECTS ARE PROVIDED OVER TEN THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS. CREATED THOUSANDS OF NEW HIGH WAGE CONSTRUCTION AND PERMANENT JOBS. I UNDERSTAND THAT STAKEHOLDERS WOULD LIKE TO MODIFY THIS PROGRAM TO ENACT WHAT THEY ARGUE ARE NECESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL UPDATES I BELIEVE AMENDMENTS WERE. DAY ARE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WHILE PRESERVING THE IMPORTANT BENEFITS OF THE EXISTING AB NINE HUNDRED PROGRAM. I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW- BALANCING THE INTERESTS OF DEVELOPERS THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY THE LABOR COMMUNITY AND OTHERS. ISN'T EASY BUT AB NINE HUNDRED AND THE PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHILE STILL PROVERBIAL. REVIEW I MEAN IN FACT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT- MOST OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE HAD TO CLEAR THE HURDLE OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH. SO CAN BE LOOKED AT THAT THERE IS A HIGH HURDLE AS IT SHOULD BE THAT THESE PROJECTS HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO BE SUPPORTED I TAKE IT IN ADDITION ADDING TO HOUSING PROJECTS TO THIS PROGRAM WILL GIVE US ANOTHER TOOL TO TACKLE OUR STATES LONG STANDING HOUSING PRODUCTION DEFICIT. EARLIER THIS YEAR AS I CLOSE. I WOULD DIE. POINT OUT THAT I MADE A PLEDGE THAT THERE WOULD BE HOUSING PRODUCTION COMING OUT OF OUR HOUSE I KNOW IT'S A HUGE CONCERN IN THIS HOUSE. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN OUR STATE PRIOR TO CODED AND SO REMAINS. IS THE HOUSING ISSUE. WE HAVE LESS MONEY TO PUT FORWARD WHICH ALL OF US WERE CONSIDERING PRE MARCH AND KOBE ED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORWARD. TO HELP ON THE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SIDE. THIS WILL BE A TOOL. SB NINE NINE FIVE IS A KEY PART IN FULFILLING THIS PLEDGE TO SPURRING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. SO I LOOK FORWARD MISTER REQUIRE. CLOSE FOR TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MADAM PRETEND I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO. RUN THE LEGISLATURE- BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR REALLY HARD WORK AND DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE. AND I ALSO WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITH THAT. WE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SENATOR MCGUIRE I APPRECIATE YOUR STAYING HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR THE BILL. SO WITHOUT ANY COMMITTEE MEMBER HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR SENATOR MCGUIRE OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES. YES MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE FOR US BEING HERE TO. ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL- WAS IT WAS AN AMENDMENT TAKEN TO DEFINE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PROJECT THAT HAS TO BE DEVOTED TO HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT REGARDING THE ISSUE OF HOUSING WE'RE SAYING THAT ANY HOUSING IS BUILT AT LEAST WITHIN THE- UNDER- 99515% WOULD BE AFFORDABLE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC. IF SB THIRTY FIVE X. IN- IT'S A TWO THIRDS ONE THIRD MIX- IN THAT IS TWO THIRDS- HOUSING WINTER COMMERCIL BUT IF THERE IS ANY SB THIRTY FIVE PROVISION THAT WOULD KICK IN REGARDS TO MONEY. AND COULD YOU REMIND ME. SO THE SB THIRTY FIVE PROVISION THAT WAS THE- THE SCOTT WINNER BILL FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT. IT'S SO RIGHT NOW IT IT IS JUST THE FIFTEEN FOR. 15% AFFORDABLE I'M IN SO WILL TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF LIKE A AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A LARGE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THAT- WHETHER TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR CITY COUNCIL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE MIX OF COMMERCIAL HOUSING MAY BE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN REGARDS TO THE HOUSING COMPONENT THIS ISSUE IS THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO SAY THAT THERE'S GONNA BE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRWOMAN BECAUSE THE CHAIRWOMAN IS SAYING- ON HE HOUSING PIECE. IS THAT- THE INCLUSIONARY ZONING ORDINANCE WOULD- TRUMP THE 15% AFFORDABLE SO WE ALSO RESPECT THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED BY GERMAN FRIEDMAN IN INDIA IT REALLY MAKES SENSE TO ALLOW THAT FOR THAT LOCAL CONTROL ESPECIALLY. IF IT'S A STRONGER PROVISION- ABOVE AND BEYOND THE LIKE SAY A PROJECT THAT THE PROPOSES TO YOU KNOW WHAT 95% COMMERCIAL AND 5% HOUSING- TO QUALIFY A 5% OF THE HOUSING IS DEVOTED TO IT MEETS THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENT. WELL NO THAT THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENT WOULD BE THAT THAT'S JUST GONNA BE BASED ON WHATEVER THE LOCAL HATS- SO THAT'S THAT'S STRICTLY BASED OFF OF LOCAL SO IF THERE IS IN PLEASE SHERMAN PUSH BACK ON IF YOU THINK COMING CORRECT ON THIS. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING WITHIN THIS BILL NOW. WE'VE CREATED A SECOND CATEGORY SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY FOR THOSE LARGE- PROJECTS LIKE WE SEEN WITH. STADIUMS SO- UNDER THESE PROJECTS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THERE BEEN TEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS SINCE AB NINE HUNDRED IS ADOPTED TEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS HAVE EITHER BEEN BUILT. INDOOR APPROVED OR GETTING BUILT NOW IN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES NUMBER ONE- THE SECOND A NEW CATEGORY THAT WE'RE ADDING IS WE'RE ACTUALLY ADDING THE SAME JUDICIAL REVIEW SHOT CLOCK OF THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. FOR HOUSING PRICE. AT MILLION DOLLARS GROSS COSTS OR MORE. IN WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE 15% OF THE ENTIRE STOCK. AS AFFORDABLE- AND- IF THERE'S INCLUDE YOUR HOUSING- ZONING ORDINANCE. WHETHER IT'S LA OR SMALL COMMUNITIES WELL. THAT WOULD BUT IF IT'S- MORE AGGRESSIVE NOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THAT BUT THAT MIGHT. MY CONCERN IS THAT- THIS CAN BE- AMENDED TOUTED AS A HOUSING PRODUCTION BILL YEAH BUT IF THIS IS. YOU KNOW ONE GIANT LOOPHOLE TO. TO GET- 95% COMMERCIAL PROJECT WITH A- VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE SHOULD DEVOTE THE HOUSING- THAT'S THE THAT'S THE SB THIRTY FIVE. WILL MEETING S. B. FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY THIRTY FIVE THE PROVISION THERE IS IF YOU HAVE TO RESEARCH HOW. DOES TO THIRTY HOUSING ONE. AT COMMERCIAL AND- WILL BE ALLOWED TO. I THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. THE SECOND IS HOW. A IN TERMS OF THE 15% INCLUSIONARY- HOUSE HAVE FORMAL TO FIND. WE JUST SAY FOR HOUSING SO THAT WOULD BE WITHIN OUR THREE CATEGORIES OF MIND A MODERATE LOW AND VERY LOW. BUT WE DO NOT DISTINGUISH- WHICH CATEGORY WOULD BE THAT WOULD RECEIVE PREFERENCE WITHIN NINE NINE FIVE. SO. THE MODERATE. YEAH THE MODERATE TO INCOME- WOULD QUALIFY FOR YEAH MADRE YEAH WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES AND I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER IMPORTANT PIECE ABOUT THIS IT WOULD ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT- DEALING WITH THAT 15% TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHATEVER THEIR NUMBERS MAY BE WHERE THEY NEED SHORT AND ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO- WORK THAT 15% DEPENDING ON WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS. RELATED TO AFFORDABLE OKAY I MEAN I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT I THINK A- CENTER YOU YOU HAVE A- COMMUNITIES ARE SIMILAR TO MY COMMUNITIES WHERE. MY COMMUNITIES THEY'RE THEY'RE COMPLAINING THAT THE- THAT THE THAT THE STATE IS TALKING ABOUT THE- BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALL THEY SEE IS- A LUXURY HOUSING BEING BUILT. ON AND- YOU KNOW WHY MODERATE TO MODERATELY AFFORDABLE IS BETTER THAN LUXURY. THE CONCERN IS THAT. YOU KNOW THESE BILLS THAT ARE BEING TOUTED AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS ARE NOT. MORE DIRECTLY- AND TO A GREATER EXTENT- FOCUSING ON THE LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME- SITES I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT THINKING WHO DOES HAVE A VERY I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT WITH THAT IN REGARDS TO THIS POINT IS THAT. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT- ARE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE- EIGHT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE CALL THE CRISIS IN IT IS MORE EXASPERATED NOW IS IN REGARDS TO THE ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. WHAT I'LL SAY IS- THAT THERE'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN REGARD TO ADDING THAT 50% AFFORDABLE INTO THIS MIX- THIS- WE HAVE NEVER TOUTED THIS IS A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL BUT- THIS YOU WILL SEE HOUSING PRODUCTION AS PART OF THIS BILL I DIDN'T SEE NINE. WAS FOR. PASS IT WAS PASS BY THE STATE. APPROXIMATELY TEN TO TWO HUNDRED UNITS HAVE EITHER BEEN BUILT. PERMITTED AND OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION- AND NOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE NEED TO BE A STRENGTH IN THIS- BY ADDING IT CAN PERCENT OF- AFFORDABLE COMPONENT. BUT I DO HEAR YOU CENTER MURATSUCHI YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT IN REGARDS TO THE CRISIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. LAST QUESTION IS- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT THE PRO TEM IS NOT ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENT AS IT RELATES TO THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED REDUCTION- IF THAT IS CORRECT YOU WILL. EXPLAIN WHY. LOOK I THINK THAT HERE'S WHERE WE ENDED UP I THINK WE THROUGH THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CHAIRWOMAN- COMMITTEE STAFF INTO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PRO TEAM I THINK THAT- WE HAVE- A BILL THAT IS MUCH MORE FOCUS ON METRICS RELATED TO I. GHG. REDUCTIONS AND- MISTER SOLOMON YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WOULD AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT WE ARE NOT. MOVING FORWARD ON THAT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT I THINK ON AB EIGHT NINE HUNDRED AND NOW SB NINE NINE FIVE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE BALANCING ACT- AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN- PROTEIN MACHEN'S AS WELL AS THE CHAIRWOMAN. IS A BILL THAT- BRINGS FORWARD A MORE AGGRESSIVE. A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO- WAYNE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE POTENTIAL PROJECTS. AND LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL ECONOMIC REALITY THAT WE'RE IN NOW OF TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET- BOTH COMMERCIAL. RETAIL AS WELL AS HOUSING BILLS- IN FOLKS HIRED- AND THAT'S THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL. IS THAT- IT IS FOCUSING ON GETTING FOLKS CONNECTED TO FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES- IN WHAT WE KNOW IS SINCE THIS AB NINE HUNDRED. APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND JOBS BEEN CREATED ON THESE PROJECTS- BUT- AND THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF. F. A STRIP SEAT BASED IN. THANKS TO AGREEMENT I'D IS STRUCK TODAY WE ENHANCED WHEN IT COMESTO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION MITIGATION SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP PRIORITY WHEN IT COMES TO MITIGATION WILL THOSE MEDICATIONS. SIDE THEN A FEW. OF THE MANY CONTENT SITE WILL BE NEXT YEAR AND COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT IT WOULD BE WITH THE STATE OKAY IN THE OTHER SICKENING. PIECES ON THE HOUSING. WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW. STANDARDS AGAIN. MUCH IMPROVED FROM THE ORIGINAL AB NINE HUNDRED- YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND OTHER ISSUES. CERTAINLY I MEAN I APPRECIATE TO. YOU KNOW THAT THAT- WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RAISE THE STANDARDS ON- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL. CONSIDERATIONS SINCE AB NINE HUNDRED WAS WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED HI I JUST WANTED TO ASK ONE LAST. THE QUESTION WHICH IS SAID TO BE ON. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CITES A TWENTY NINETEENTH SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH REPORT- THAT. THAT TALKS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF REVIEWS OF PAST AB NINE HUNDRED PROJECTS- DISCUSSES DISCUSSES THE OF A PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF HOW IT LOOKS LIKE. THE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MANIPULATE MANIPULATION- AND THAT- YOU KNOW YOUR OWN SENATE ALSO RESEARCH ACTUALLY RECOMMENDS THE ELIMINATION OF THE USE OF GAC BASELINES AT TO PROVIDE MORE ROBUST- LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WITH ONE OF THE OPTIONS BEING RECOMMENDED THE VEHICLE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TO THAT THRESHOLD- COULD YOU COULD YOU- RESPOND TO WHY THIS THIS BILL IS NOT. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT- THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH- RECOMMENDED 100% SO I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- I THINK THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE SEEN- IMPROVEMENTS AND ENHANCEMENTS UNDER SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY THREE- IN AS YOU ALL KNOW THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH. HAS ALSO BEEN FOCUS ON THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ON THE ISSUE OF THE STUDY- I WILL GO BACK TO MR SOMEONE IN IN READ- THE STUDY I HAVE NOT READ JUST BE VERY CANDID WITH YOU THE ENTIRE STUDY. I THINK THAT IS CRITICAL. WHAT IS IN FRONT OF TODAY IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AB NINE HUNDRED WAS- A FEW YEARS AGO. AND IT'S THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE- IS WELL AS THE COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP APPROACH. AMERICANS AGAIN WERE MOVING NEEDLE SO. ON CREATING A NEW BASELINE WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE SECRET STANDARDS TO THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ENHANCED- ENFORCEABLE STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO GHG MITIGATION WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- AND WE ARE SUBJECTING HIGHER SECRET STANDARDS TO HOUSING PROJECTS AS WELL. BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO TACKLE- YOU KNOW THAT THE PROTEIN IS ONE OF THE LEADING VIRAL VOICES- AS WELL AS VOICES FOR. HOUSING IN THIS LEGISLATURE- AND THIS MOVES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION KNOWING THAT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE WORK WHEN IT COMES TO- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR TO CONTINUE. ACCENT NO THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER AND REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COMMENTS. IN LEADERSHIP ARE TRULY. OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO ONE ELSE- SO I WILL I CLOSE BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH ME YESTERDAY AND THE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND THE PRO TEM- AND THE HARD WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS BILL IT'S A COMPLICATED POLICY- AND I THINK THAT THE BILL DOES GO A LONG WAY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE LOOPHOLES AND FIXES AN OLD AB NINE HUNDRED. AND TO TRY TO STRIKE THE BALANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A- BENEFIT FOR PROJECTS THAT DEMONSTRATE REAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND WELL I THINK THAT THE- MEMONS. GOAL OF A LONG WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE VERY ALIGNED IN TERMS OF THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE I DO THINK THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE WITH THE DRAFTING AND- MAKING SURE THAT. THE DETAILS ARE ARE REALLY IN THE BILL SO THAT. THEY GIVE THE OF CERTAINTY TO COMMUNITIES THAT. DEVELOPERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE TRUNCATED PROCESS. TO SHORT CHANGE- WITH THE VERY LARGE PROJECTS- I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT I SEE IS A LITTLE BIT OF VAGUENESS WITH THE WORDS LIKE USABLE BEST EFFORTS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE GO FORWARD. THAT THERE'S REALLY A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT DEVELOPERS CHOOSE THAT MITIGATION FOR INSTANCE ONSITE REAL WHEN FEASIBLE. AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHO DECIDES WHAT'S FEASIBLE AND- TO THAT END I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME- AGREEMENT HERE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GIVE INPUT AND- HAVE THAT DISCUSSION SO THAT AT THE END WE ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE. THAT WE SAFE GOING TO DO THE MITIGATION THAT'S FEASIBLE THAT THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN WE GO OUT AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW I'M NOT FEASIBLE WE'RE GONNA GO DO SOMETHING CHEAPER SOMEWHERE ELSE. I THINK THAT REALLY NAILING DOWN. HOW IT WILL WORK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT NEIGHBORHOODS THEMSELVES GET THE MEDICATION THAT THEY DESERVE. ALONG WITH EXCELLENT PROJECTS SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU- AND THE PROTON ARE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A KEEPING US INVOLVED IN JUST. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED SO I THINK THE- AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT YOUR HOME IS COMING FROM IS THAT THE WORD FEASIBLE IS ACTUALLY IN LOVE WITH SEQUEL- IN UNDERSTAND THAT IT SOUNDS SQUISHY. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CASE LAW AROUND IT CANDIDLY AND AS YOU KNOW MEDICARE WE'RE WILLING TO SIT DOWN ANY TIME IN EVERY TIME YOU WOULD LIKE TO TODAY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON IT WAS COMMITMENT THAT. THE PRO TEN EIGHT AND AGAIN THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN VERY GREAT IT DOWN YESTERDAY AND HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AGAIN YOU CAN SEE. COME AND I SAID I. THE GOAL TO MAKE THAT WE GIVE NUMBER FOR WORK. INSPECTION DON'T GO TO PROVING IS A- SO I APPRECIATE IN THE SECOND THIS AS THE MOVES TO THE PROCESS. I'VE MOSTLY A- THE WILL TO TAKE THEM. AND TO HAVE THE AT THAT SORT OF THIS LATE TIME IN THIS TRUNCATED SCHEDULE THAT WE HAVE- SO THANK YOU I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AND WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE SIR THANK YOU I'LL BE VERY QUICK IN ON BEHALF OF- PROTEIN AMERICANS AGAIN I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR WOMAN SHE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH. YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH. I THINK THAT WHERE WE HAVE LANDED TODAY IS A MUCH STRONGER PRODUCT MUCH LONGER PRODUCT IN BRINGING BALANCE ONE STRONGER WORK PRODUCT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF. STRICTER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS NUMBER TWO CREATING A CATEGORY- WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING TO BE ABLE TO HELP SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN BIG COMMUNITIES AND SMALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN NUMBER THREE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN CHALLENGE NUMBER TIME'S MANAGER HAD TO BE ABLE TO CAL.

ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO JULY TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TO REMOVE THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY EXPEDITED REVIEW PROVISION- PLEASE NOTE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DOES NOT A PINE ON THE MERITS WELL YOU ARE IMPORTANT TO ME OF THE- JACK. THE COUNCIL ROCK THE ONE YEAR DEAL IN EMPLOYMENT OF ANY LETTER. THAT THE COUNCIL AMEND OR DRAFT NEW WILL THE COURT. JUST DELAY ENSURES THAT THE COUNCIL MAY FAITHFULLY UNDERTAKE THE MONTHLONG INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PUBLIC REVIEW AND FEEDBACK PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR THE ADOPTION. OF NEW OR MODIFIED RULES. AND IN THE CASE OF SB SEVEN FIVE SEVEN THE PROPOSAL I WON TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEADLINE FOR ENACTING RULES SIMPLY IS NOT ACHIEVABLE THE IMPOSITION OF A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY TIMELINE FOR REVIEW OF THE TWENTY EIGHT BY TWENTY EIGHT HELLER PROJECT. ON TOP OF EXISTING CALENDAR PREFERENCES THAT EXISTENCE EQUAL CASES IS UNREALISTICALLY SHORT- FOR THAT TRIAL COURT IN LOS ANGELES TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT EACH OF THE CASES IS LIKELY TO PREVENT. ESPECIALLY RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. EVEN WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT REFERENCES TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. AND IN FACT-THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE TIME FRAME IS FROM THE VERY OUTSET NOT YOU THE BALL. THE FIRST IS THAT HE COULD CASES ARE INHERENTLY TIME CONSUMING IN MOST CASES THERE ARE PARTIES ON EITHER SIDE MANY. ARE FOR DELAY OR CAN YOU IN THIS EVEN IN THOSE. WHERE THAT AND- TO HAPPEN. THERE'S ARE GOING TO BE MAYBE FIVE TO SIX MONTHS BEFORE A CASE. GET GET TO TRY A LITTLE TO ADDRESS. AND THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WHAT X. FACTOR IT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DATE ALL INCLUDES OKAY TWEET THANK YOU UNREAL OF. US I CAN LEE ACTIVE OKAY ALL AND AN AREA. AND NON D. COULD YOU DO REVIEW OR APPEALED THE MIDST OF THE CASES BOTH CASES WILL REQUIRE A STAY AT THE INITIAL. AND THEN TO MAKE THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DATE TIMELINE ON FEASIBLE. AND THEN FINALLY GIVEN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE THE PANDEMIC THE COURTS AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO ANTICIPATED A SIGNIFICANT PANDEMIC WITH MEDIC GEN. RELATED TO UNLAWFUL. ACTION HELLO. DO YOU WANT THEM TO QUEUE UP BY PRESSING ONE THEN ZERO HOWEVER THEY QUEUE UP THEY CAN QUEUE UP BUT IT'S TIME FOR ALL OPPOSITION OKAY IS TO SB SEVEN FIVE SEVEN.

SENATE ALLEN COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CONCERNS THAT THAT SHE RAISED REGARDING GOT. THE RESOLUTION THE IN HER OPINION THE UNREALISTICALLY SHORT TO IN A SEVENTY DAY. TIME PERIOD FOR BUT I MEAN I KNOW THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT'S THERE WAS PROP IN THE LAST BILL I MEAN I THINK THE ONE I SUPPOSE THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAST ON THIS ONE IS THAT. WERE REALLY THERE ARE VRY FEW PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS- THEY'RE BEING YOU KNOW CARRIED OUT BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT HAVE YEAH THAT IS WHOSE PROCESSES ARE FULLY.

THEY STILL TO GO THROUGH A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AS PART OF THIS BILL BUT BUT WE'RE NOT TAUGHT THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO. CREATE A WHOLE NEW SLEW OF EXPEDITED REVIEW PROJECTS AND WE'RE WE'RE- WE'RE TALK ABOUT MAJOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS- FIVE TEN. PROJECTS HERE A STATEWIDE- AND MAYBE FIFTEEN THAT WILL BE COVERED UNDER THE PARAMETERS OF THIS BILL. SO I APPRECIATE THE ARGUMENTS I'VE HEARD THEM FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I ONLY THINK WE OUGHT TO BETTER FIND OUR COURT SYSTEM. WE PUT THEM IN A AND IN A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE. BUT YOU KNOW- WITH RESPECT HIM DEEP RESPECT TO THE COUNCIL I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE CAMEL'S BACK THAT'S RIGHT WE DON'T HEAR FROM HER ON THE LAST ALRIGHT.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY. MY TRANSMITTING HERE YES YOU ARE COULD VERY WELL GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENTES BE THIRTEEN OH ONE. I'D LIKE TO GIVE SPECIAL THANKS TO YOU MISTER WOMAN FOR AND OF COURSE YOUR STAFF FOR THE NORMANS HELP IN HELPING US TO IRON OUT. OF THIS BILL TO A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING.THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF. A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY. POLLUTION AND OF RAW SEWAGE FLOWS THAT COME INTO NOT ONLY IS COMMUNITY SUPPORTED TO THE OCEAN OF COURSE AFFECT SO MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES AND CITIES AROUND THE COAST OF SAN DIEGO ON AN AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED GALLONS OF SEWAGE FLOW FROM MEXICO INTO THE QUAN A RIVER VALLEY TO INACTION AND RAM PROBLEMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HERE IN THE US AND THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I OFFERED SB FIVE OH SEVEN WHICH AUTHORIZES ANNUAL COUNTY TO CONDUCT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT- ON ON THE CUENTA RIVER VALLEY THAT REPORT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED AND INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IDENTIFYING TWENTY SEVEN PROJECTS WHICH WILL GREATLY REDUCE IMPACTS- TO THE RIVER VALLEY. FROM TRANS BOUNDARY FLOWS BASED ON STUDY- BASED ON THIS STUDY USMC RECENTLY ALLOCATED THREE HUNDRED MILLION. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY- THE PROJECT HOWEVER I HAS IDENTIFIED THAT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WE NEED. A FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS DIVERTER THAT WILL CAPTURE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE PER DAY. THIS WILL ESSENTIALLY STOP POLLUTION AFTER AFTER ALMOST FORTY YEARS BUT- UNFORTUNATELY ONLY PARTIALLY. SO WHILE WE HAVE SOME RESOURCES IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND IN ORDER FOR US TO. DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY WE REALLY HAVE TO GO BEYOND WHAT A ONE SINGLE PROJECT CAN ACCOMPLISH AND I'M WORKING VERY HARD TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO AND WITH THE STATE ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ALL THE OFFICIAL BUT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SEWAGE TREATMENT. OUR SYSTEM AT THE QUANAH TO SEE WHAT ELSE THAT WE CAN DO THAT- IS MORE FEASIBLE. WELL WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THE MAJORITY OF THIS THESE PROBLEMS. THE CITY OF TIJUANA WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. AND OFTENTIMES THAT GROWTH COMES WITH DISCONNECTION TO THE SEWER SYSTEM. AND WE COULD EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS THE CITY GROWS THIS PROBLEM CONTINUE TO GROW LYSIS ADDRESSED. SO WE HAVE INTRODUCED THIS BILL. WHICH WOULD CREATE A- A MITIGATION PROGRAM- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THAT WOULD OF AN ESSENCE CREATE A WATERSHED STE. MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT AS OF THE CITY OF TIJUANA CONTINUES TO GROW. THAT. THEY TAKE MEASURES TO PREVENT RUN OFF AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WELL HOW COULD WE WRITE A BILL THAT WILL COMPEL MEXICO TO DO ANYTHING WE REALLY CAT BUT WHAT WE CAN. DO IS PUT UP CALIFORNIA AND IN A POSITION. TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS PROBLEM. AND AS WE ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SOME OF THAT MONEY MAY GO. TO BE SPENT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THAT'S WHY THE TIME THE BILL IS ESSENTIAL TO GETTING THIS BILL OUT. IN THE NEXT A FEW MONTHS. IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE MAINTAINING. SUIT TO GIVING CALIFORNIA LEVERAGE ON HOW THOSE FUNDS FUNDS ARE SPENT. AND ADDING THIS TO ANY WORK PLAN THAT WE CAN AGREE TO WITH MEXICO WITH THROUGH THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS. SO IF I CAN IT RE EXPLAIN THAT. IN BEFORE WE INVEST A PENNY I'D LIKE THERE TO BE A COMMITMENT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER TO RESOLVE THISPROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL TO A LONG TERM STRATEGY AND THIS BILL ESSENTIAL IT WILL GIVE CALIFORNIA THEM GOSHI EIGHTY POWER JUST DOWN WITH WHAT THE- REPRESENTATIVES MEXICO AND EAT AND INCLUDE THIS IN A PACKAGE OF A- OF RELIEF TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. AND RIGHT NOW IF WE WAIT ANOTHER YEAR WE'RE GONNA LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND POSSIBLY NOW REALLY DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN EVER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THREE HUNDRED MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY. AND AT ANY COULD GO ENORMOUS OF WAY TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT IF WE DO IT RIGHT WE CAN SOLVE THE ENTIRE PROBLEM WITH THESE FUNDS AND ADDING THIS. ADDING THIS BILL TO THAT NEGOTIATION WILL REALLY HELP US SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL SO I WE DIDN'T WE HAVE A SUPPORTERS BUT BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS WE'VE WE'VE- WE HAVE TO. DECIDED NOT TO HAVE THEM- PRESENT. AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS REPORT LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP NOT ONLY ONE OF THE MOST TREASURED. ECOLOGICAL AREAS IN OUR COUNTRY TO DECLARE VALLEY A RAMSAR SITE. AND HELP TO- IT CLEANER OCEANS BEACHES THERE ARE CLOSED. TO AND FIFTY OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS RUNOFF.

THANK YOU MEMBERS BILL MAKES MULTIPLE CHANGE IN STATE LAW TO AN THE BILL THE STATE FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS THE BILL EXPANDS THE AREA WHERE FIRE SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS APPLY BEYOND THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES IN THE LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREA. MAJOR FIRES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES SUCH AS THE TUBBS FIRE THAT DEVASTATED FOLKY PARKINSON ON THE COUNTY. CURRENTLY BUILDING STANDARDS ARE NOT REQUIRED IN THOSE AREAS. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HEADWATERS ECONOMICS REPORT FOUND NEGLIGIBLE COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A TYPICAL HOME AND HOME CONSTRUCTED USING WILD FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS AND DESIGN FEATURES. DECADES OF RESEARCH AND POST FIRE ASSESSMENT TO PROVIDE A CLEAR EVIDENCE OF BUILDING MATERIALS AND DESIGN. COUPLED WITH LANDSCAPING ON THE PROPERTY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR HOMES ABILITY TO SURVIVE A WILDFIRE. STAFF IS WORKING ON AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL DISCRETION ON WHAT PARTS OF THE MODERATE FIRE HAZARDS ON TO EXPAND THE STANDARDS TO. THE SUPPORTS THE BILL AND THESE CHANGES. THIS BILL MAKES IT EASIER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT INCLUDE PROVISIONS COVERING ADJACENT PROPERTIES REMOVING RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE ORDINANCES AND INCLUDING PROVISIONS ON ADJACENT PROPERTY FUEL MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S MODEL ORDINANCE. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THAT THE ONE HUNDRED FEET OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE FROM A STRUCTURE WHEN THE PARCEL LINE IS LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET AWAY. THIS BILL CREATES A TRAINING PROGRAM TO UTILIZE VOLUNTEERS TO DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING ASSESSMENTS. WHICH WILL HELP UTILIZED HELLFIRE DEFENSIBLE SPACE RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND TUITION ENSURE VOLUNTEERS AND HOW FAR ARE SHARING A CONSISTENT MESSAGE ON DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES A REPORT FROM CAL FIRE ON THE STATUS BENEFITS AND SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS COMMITTED BY SB NINE OH ONE. WHICH APPROXIMATELY HALF IS ALREADY BEEN SPENT. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LOSE FOUGHT FOR US FORSBERG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND PAUL MANSON FROM THE PACIFIC FOREST TRUST. RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE WITH OUR FIRST WITNESS LIST BY PHONE. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT LEAD FOURTH BURKE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BAKE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE STATE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK. INCLUDING A ONE BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO FOUR TOP AND FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. HOWEVER WE CAN DO MORE TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATURE IN THE FACE OF QUALIFIERS BY TOLERATING FOREST RESTORATION IN CREATING FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITY. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE AKE CALIFORNIA'S FIRE PRONE REGIONS MORE RESILIENT BY CREATING AND MAINTAINING DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND HELP. SB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO IMPROVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS AND HIGH FIRE RISK AREA WE CREATING A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR VOLUNTEER. HELP SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET WILL BE THE FACT THAT AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORT. WE MUST ALSO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH. SB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WOULD FURTHER FORCE RESTORATION THE STATE BY ADOPTING A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS LANDSCAPE SCALE PROJECTS TO HAPPEN ON NATIONAL FOREST LAND. IN FACT IN OUR FEDERAL COURTS TO RESTORATION WILL NOT ONLY REDUCE FIRE RISK BUT ALSO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF OUR COURTS PROVIDE VALUABLE PUBLIC BENEFITS. INCLUDING WATER SUPPLY CARBON RICH WILDLIFE HABITAT AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WILL ALSO SUPPORTING LOCAL JOBS AND KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WITH A CUTTER STERN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITH THIS PLEASE. THANK YOU AT THE PALMETTO DESERVE FOREST I REALLY LIKE THIS ECHO MUCH OF WHAT BOB IS FORT BURKE IS ALREADY SAID WHAT THE WITH THE TRIGGER HAS ALREADY CONVEYED ABOUT THE BILL.

GET BETTER. AFFECTIONATE FOR WITH SOME OF INVESTMENT THAT WE ARE MAY TOWARD MAKING. AND COMMUNITIES MORE SAFE WITH SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING. PURSUANT TO THE BILLION DOLLARS FROM SB NINE A ONE WAS MADE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. SO IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE ARRIVAL THANK YOU.

MADAM CHAIR RICHARD MARCUSSEN FOR THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. WE CERTAINLY DON'T OPPOSE CENTER HER TODDLER'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE A CLEAN WATER OR THE STATUTORY EXEMPTION UNDER CYCLIC. OF FOR THESE PROJECTS HOWEVER. THE LANGUAGE THAT QUITE FRANKLY WAS IMPOSED UPON HER- WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY THE THIS THE STRONG SUPPORT THAT THE BILL HAS RECEIVED FROM ORGANIZED LABOR WILL MAKE IT. VERY DIFFICULT WE BELIEVE OF FOR THE WATER DISTRICTS BUT TO COMPLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMPLISTIC TO SAY THAT THE BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. HOWEVER THAT IS DEFINED IN THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE. AS REQUIRING THAT 60% OF THE JOURNEY WORKERS WHO WERE EMPLOYED ON THESE PROJECTSMUST HAVE GRADUATED FROM AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- WE THINK THAT THIS PROVISION IN ITSELF IS GOING TO RESULT IN. THE LOSS OF A JOB SUPPORT DURING WORKERS- THE LOSS OF CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES OF FOR LOCAL CONTRACTORS AND THAT ALL THE WORK FOR DOING THESE PROJECTS IS GOING TO GO TO BAY AREA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS. WHO CAN COMPLY WITH THE 60% GRADUATION RATE- AS MR OWN POINTED OUT THERE IS ALSO- PILLAY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WE OPPOSED TO WE'VE ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO SEVERAL WATER OF PROVIDERS- IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS AND SAID THAT- THE ADVANTAGES FROM HAVING THE STATUTORY EXEMPTION FROM SEEK WORK. WILL BE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE WORK FOR REQUIRE. AND FOR THAT REASON. WE COULD IS A TO THE MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN TWELVE WHICH IS STEP WHICH IS A PROGRAM FOR THE PLUGIN AND ABANDONING OF HAZARDOUS OR IDLE DESERTED WELLS THE COMMISSION TO ASSOCIATE FACILITIES IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY- THIS YEAR I SAT WITH CONSTITUENTS DOWN AND KERN COUNTY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF RESOURCES IN OUR REGION. AND YOU KNOW LOCAL LEADERS AND ADVOCATES SHARED THEIR STORIES ABOUT HOW UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO BE NEGLECTED WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION JOBS AND MOST OF ALL PUBLIC HEALTH WITH YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT AS HIGH AS SIX POINT FOR WHEN THE REST OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THREE PERCENT- THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- THAT THE RESIDENTS OF KERN COUNTY FEEL REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT. I'VE HAD HONEST CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW TO TACKLE ONE THINK A PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IN ADDITION TO OUR CONVERSATIONS THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY REPORTED THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE AND IDLE OIL AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS INCLUDES FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY WALLS IT MAY HAVE NO VIABLE OPERATOR. OR AT HIGH RISK OF BECOMING ORPHANED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ARE THESE IDLE AN ORPHAN WELLS CAN RELEASE TOXIC EMISSIONS TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES CREATING HEALTH CONCERNS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITHIN THAT AREA. TODAY AS WE ARE FACING A WORLD HEALTH CRISIS TOGETHER DUE TO COVER NINETY. THE ISSUE STILL OCCURS OVER COMMUNITIES OF KERN COUNTY AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. SB TEN TWELVE REQUIRES CALCIUM TO PARTICIPATIF OF OUR COMMUNITIES WILL TAKING REASONABLE STEPS TO RECOVER PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT COST ASSOCIATED WITH DECOMMISSIONING ATTENDED FACILITIES.

SB TEN TWELVE ALL REQUIRES CALCIUM INCLUDE IN THEIR ANGER REPORT AN UPDATE TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH INCLUDE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS OF CAPITAL WEALTH AND FACILITIES THE REGISTERED OPERATOR AND WHETHER THE OPERATORS ARE COMPLYING. WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAW. AND TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR DEBTS IN OUR END- THE MAYOR OF OUR BEEN WHO SIT JOSE COROLLA AT THAT ARE HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE QUEUE UP THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND BRING THE ARE AT THE A DR. BOOM HOWEVER- ON TO THE LINE. YEAH AND DOCTOR DOOM HOLLERED AT MINUS OPEN. WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HONORING ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. MY NAME IS JORDAN HOW ARE AND I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. I'VE BEEN STUDYING ORGAN AND I DON'T WELL IT'S USED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY A POST DOCTORAL SCHOLAR CANTERED. AND NOW A MEMBER OF THE UCSD FACULTY. I WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY REPORT WORKING WELDING. AN INITIAL OF THE STATE'S POTENTIAL. TO PLUG COMMISSION WORKS IN OIL AND GAS WELLS I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TODAY. I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I'M NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR OR AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR BILL- BUT I WAS INVITED TO PROVIDE EXPERT INPUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO DO THAT- AND TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE IF I CAN IF I CAN BE HELPFUL. SO ROUGHLY SPEAKING THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE AND IDLE OIL AND NATURAL GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. EACH OF THESE WELLS WILL EVENTUALLY NEED TO BE PLUGGED WITH CEMENT ANY ASSOCIATED SIR. MEDIATED ACTIVITIES PERFORMED ONE WELL THE NO LONGER BE USED IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE RISK OF GROUND AND- METHANE WE AND OTHER IN AND HEALTH COSTS. THESE ARE CALLED PLUGGING AND STEPS REQUIRED BY LAW. HOWEVER IN CASES WHERE THE RESPONSIBLE OPERATORS HAVE BECOME FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT OR SIMPLY CAN NO LONGER BE LOCATED. IDYLLWILD MAY BECOME ORPHANED WELLS OR WELLS WITH NO RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR PLUGGING AND DECOMMISSIONING. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES OPERATORS TO POST BONDS THAT CAN BE USED TOWARDS CLOSING COSTS WHEN WELL THEY'RE OPEN. IN GENERAL THE AMOUNTS OF THESE BONDS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER THAN PLUGGING AND DECOMMISSIONING COSTS. THE RISK OF BECOMING AN ORPHAN WELL AS HISTORICALLY THE HIGHEST FOR WELLS OPERATED BY SMALL FINANCIALLY WEAK COMPANIES. AT THE SAME TIME TO RETHINK COLLAPSE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES TO COVER NINETEEN AT ILLUSTRATED HOW INDUSTRYWIDE SHOCKS CAN THREATEN THE FINANCIAL HELP WITH EVEN VERY LARGE OPERATORS. IN OUR REPORT MY CCSD CO AUTHORS AND I PERFORMED AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF WATER WELL IN CHOOSING CALIFORNIA. BASED ON READILY AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT OURS CAL JAM. THIS ANALYSIS WOULD BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

INTERESTED BECAUSE I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU CLARIFY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL OF THE INMATES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN AND WHY THEY NOW HAVE CONCERNS. WELL FIRST OF ALL SAID WHAT. RUSSIAN OF THE CHAIR. FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL IS NOT SPONSORED BY ANY PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION AT THIS IS. A BILL THAT IS SPONSORED BY- BY ME AT RIGHT AND- IT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE YOU KNOW THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING I WANTED TO CLARIFY THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. ARE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS- THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE DEFEATED AND SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M ABOUT IN TERMS OF. WHY DOES IT WORK IN SUPPORT NOW IN THIS THEY DON'T FIT WITH THE AMENDMENT I'M TAKING HERE TODAY. OKAY. YES CENTER- I SHADOWS BILLS BEEN INTERESTING FOR YOU BUT IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL DID A ONE EIGHTY. PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY THAT WAS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE NOW COMING OFF ORIGINALLY RIGHT BECAUSE OF THESE AMENDMENTS GOING TO POSE IT EVERYBODY WAS OPPOSED BECAUSE THE MINISTER NOW SUPPORT. SO FEELS LIKE. WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO IS NOT GETTING WHEN I GET IN THERE. IS THAT CORRECT. WELL I MEAN THE VERSION THAT I MOVED FORWARD IS NOT MOVING FORWARD BUT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY TO ME WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT AND ALTHOUGH IT'S THAT. THAT WE REPRESENT TRAIT THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT REPRESENTS AT PEOPLE THAT ARE NEAR IDLE BALLS AND SO. I THINK- THAT THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TAKEN AND THEN TRYING TO MOVE. THE CONVERSATION FORWARD AND SO HAVING THAT IN MIND. I JUST. OKAY THANK YOU QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW IF I HAD THE SUPPORT TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON WITH COBIT AND- AND WITH VALLEY FEVER JUST RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND THESE THINGS THAT ARE JUST COMING TOGETHER I MEAN. TO DO I MEAN I WANTED TRY TO MAKE IT TO IN ANY POSSIBLE AND SO WANTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION- EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE MOMENTS THAT I BROUGHT FORTH. OUT OF. MAKE YOUR HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT SPOT WITH TWENTY TO HELP. TODAY I THINK IT'S JUST A BIT THIS. THAT IT JUST FEELS KIND OF HAVING TO LOOK MEMBERS DISPLAY THE GAME AT THIS BILL GOT FLIPPED ON ITS HEAD. SO I APPRECIATE YOU AND I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT EARLIER AND I'M JUST NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO. CHECK THAT. ANYONE ELSE COMMITTEE. I'LL JUST SAY I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH ON THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT AREA TO TRY TO LEGISLATE IN AND CERTAINLY HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACTS. A FROM IDLE WELLS. AND WE HAVE IMPACTS MODEL ROLLS AROUND THE STATE THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT TAXPAYERS ARE IN ON THE LINE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I DON'T WELL. CREATES AN ISSUE OR EVEN WHEN I TO WELCH'S LEFT BEHIND IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN OF. GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH US I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT PLACE TO BE WHEN YOU HAVE A BILL THAT HAS OPPOSITION. AND THE POSITION. PLACE BUT AT THE SAME TIME- THIS COMMITTEE FELT THAT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A BILL THAT DIDN'T INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY SHIFTING. FROM OIL PRODUCERS TO TAXPAYERS AND THAT'S WHY THE AMENDMENTS WERE PUT INTO PLACE AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL INDUSTRY. IS HAVING CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL AS WRITTEN. THIS COMMITTEE'S JOB THOUGH IS TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYERS. AND THE FOR THE RESIDENTS- AND SO THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE- POSITION THAT WETAKE AND KIND OF THE SIDE THAT WE TAKE. AND THAT'S WHY THE AMENDMENTS ARE THERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- BEING WILLING TO. I TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS. AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOR YOUR COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. SO WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION. HEY WE HAVE A MOTOR AND WE HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE TAKEN TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS. IMPORTANT BILL FOR MY DISTRICT AND FOR CALIFORNIANS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. GOT A CALL PLEASE SB TEN TWELVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AMENDED AND PREFERRED APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN HI FLORA. ANOTHER CHAO CHAO I COMING. EGGMAN EGGMAN I. GARCIA MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY. MCCARTY ALL RIGHT MATTEUCCI. RIVAS RIVAS AYE STONE. BILL BILL AS SIX SIX VOTES LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN PERHAPS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE MOVING ON TO. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY I'LL BE PRESENTING FOR MR STERN OPERATE IF YOU CAN PLEASE QUEUE THE WITNESSES UP. AND ALSO- CENTER WINNERS HERE I KNOW- SENATORS TURNS ON HE LINE RIGHT NOW. SO WE'VE ALREADY A- AND HE'S GOING TO OKAY A MOMENT BUT THANK YOU AND ARE WE PASSING THE GAVEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THAT PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MEMBERS AS CALIFORNIA SEEKS TO NAVIGATE ITS PRESENT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WERE ALSO STARING DOWN ANOTHER CRISIS. THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT THREATENS VIRTUALLY A CORNER OF OUR LIVES. THE EFFECTS HAVEBEEN WILL COME IN EVERY. LEVEL WE SEE THEM INTERNATIONALLY WERE RECENT RESEARCH RECENTLY RESEARCHERS FOUND OUT THAT ONE BILLION PEOPLE WILL BE DISPLACED OR FORCED TO INDOOR INSEPARABLE HE FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL 1 DEGREES CELSIUS TEMPERATURE RISE. WE SEE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL WHERE RISKY BUSINESS PROJECT ESTIMATES EIGHT TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF EXISTING PROPERTY WILL BE UNDER WATER. BY TWENTY FIFTY WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIX BILLION TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS AT RISK DURING HIGH TIDE. AND WE SEE THEM AT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE RISKY BUSINESS ESTIMATES THE INLAND EMPIRE WILL LOSE UP TO THIRTY EIGHT MILLION PER YEAR. AND ON DECLINES IN COTTON YIELDS. WHAT THE AVAIL RESEARCH THROUGH PROJECTS LIKE RISKY BUSINESS CLEAR IS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY CORNER OF OUR LIVES WILL BE UPENDED BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BUT DESPITE THE VALUE RESEARCH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REQUIRE A SYSTEMIC REVIEW OF OUR CLIMATE LIABILITIES. THESE OUT ANALYSES ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CRITICAL SO THAT WE CAN PINPOINT PRECISELY WHERE WE HAD MOST VULNERABLE ACT AGGRESSIVELY TO REDUCE RISK. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY WILL FILL THIS GAP BY PROVIDING FOR THE REGULAR PRODUCTION OF OUR CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. REQUIRING THAT THE ASSESSMENT STUDIES IMPACT ECONOMIC IMPACTS ALONGSIDE THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE. TO OUR STATE'S BUILT NATURAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL REQUIRE OPR TO ASSESS POTENTIAL ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION RESPONSES AND THE FINANCIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACTION READ REPORT. EXAMINATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND THE UNIQUE RISK POSED TO TRAVEL COMMUNITIES AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR PLANNERS AND DECISION MAKERS. ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT DROPPING THE REPORTS ON THEIR DESK WITHOUT GUIDELINES OF HOW TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE ACTION. THE BILL ALSO ENSURE OPR WILL COORDINATE WITH REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THIS YEAR WE'RE EXPERIENCING A FISCAL SHOCK THAT REQUIRES US TO SPEND MORE AS WE TAKE IN LESS REVENUE. THAT CHALLENGE OF A CONTRACTING ECONOMY AND EXPANDING NEED FOR COLLECTIVE IN STATE ACTION IS ALSO CENTRAL TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS THE BY UNDERSTANDING WHERE RISK LIES WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO INVEST BOLDLY TO AVOID THAT HAUNTED FUTURE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES TO SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. NOT A MODERATOR I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MISTER PARKER FREE ON THE PHONE. SENATOR AND THERE'S ONE OTHER. AND THE SENATOR PER. THANK YOU- JONATHAN PARKER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE RESOLVE HEADQUARTERED LOS ANGELES AND I DO NEED TO DISCLOSE AND I'M ALSO AN APPOINTED MEMBER THE GOVERNOR'S TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND NOT I AM NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THAT. AT ONE OF SENATOR STORER FOR TWENTY TWO MOM. IN STATUTE I CAN TO SETTLEMENTS THESE ASSESSMENT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN BY IT MINISTRY OF ACTIONS ABOUT. THOUSAND THE- MEMORIALIZATION OF THESE CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS. OF CLIMATE RESULT OF WAS THE SISTER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND ENACTING THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT. AND WE'VE SEEN HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. I AM THE DATA THAT THEY PRODUCE GET USED- ALMOST EVERY SINGLE AGENCY- HAS PASSED THE THIRTY EIGHT WITH CONCRETE CHANGE AND THEY USE THE DATA FROM. THE START. IN THEIR PLANNING THE COW ADAPT. I HOPE YOU'RE FROM WITH THE HAS THE VERY DATA FROM BEFORE ASSESSMENT THAT GETS USED BY BUT SAY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN THE RECENT PROCEEDING RELATED TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- RANKING CLIMB AT RISK AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THIS DATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS AND PLANS- FOR EXAMPLE OUR ORGANIZATION. IF YOU THINK THIS DATA IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE L. A. COUNTY ACCOUNTABLE IF DOCUMENT AND BY STATUTE WHAT EVER MANAGE TO UPDATE THEIR LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AND THEIR NO PLANS. AND STATED. NOW I WANT TO CALL TO SECTION FOUR. **** THEN APPLY PERCENT YEARS UP FOR THE CLIMATE IS TOUGH TWENTY TWO FIFTY TWENTY HUNDRED. AND FRANK HAD WE TRIED TO CHECK CERTAIN PATH AND PRIOR VERSIONS AND THIS IS THE FAULT CLIMATE IS THE AVERAGE OF WEATHER- EXPRESSED IN A POX NOT IN SPECIFIC YEARS. AND WE WERE HOPING THAT THE LINK WHICH WOULD BE CHANGED EVERY FOR. THIRTY YEAR TIME PLACES RATHER THAN SPECIFIC YEARS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT THE. WEATHER WOULD BE LIKE. AFTER YEARS BUT YOU. OPT WITH MUCH GREATER ACCURACY TRY TO DEPICT WHAT THE FUTURE CRIME THE AVERAGE APPEARS WITH THE FAMILY TO ONE ALSO CALL ATTENTION TO SECTION FORTY WHERE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE- ACTUALLY MAINTAIN SENATOR STERN TO RITUAL INTENT FOR THE STATE TO PERFORM ECONOMIC ANALYSES- AND WITH THAT WE- CHAIR UP. AND THE FOLLOWING TO BE. THE BEST SELLING BOOK ON INHABITABLE EARTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL KNOW INTERACTION NEEDED DAVID. MISTER DAVID WALLACE WELLS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. LET ME CHECK TO SEE IF HE'S ON THE LINE JUST ONE MOMENT. IT'S NOT METAL MODERATORS CENTER STERN ON THE LINE. I'M HERE WITH YOU. THE AREAS. I'LL HANG TIGHT.

EVEN THE TRANSFORMATIONS ALREADY UNFOLDING BEFORE THEIR EYES. THE COLORATIONS MAASTRICHT WITH WILD- HER. BACKYARD PERGOLA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI THE YEAR HE WAS BORN TIRES BURNED THROUGH SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES IN THE STATE YOUR HE WAS ELECTED IT WAS. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ATTEND TOLD INCREASE REELECTED IT WAS ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND YOUR BEFORE WE SPOKE TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. A 50% INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR RELEASING ENOUGH CARBON FREE ATMOSPHERE ENTIRELY WIPED OUT THE PROGRESS THE STATE HAD MADE WITH ALL ITS GREEN ENERGY AND FUEL EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AND TODAY BILLIONS OF POINTS ARE ALREADY LIVING IN BUILDING HOUSING IN VERY HIGH. WHAT PART AREAS. THE LONGTIME ADVOCATE OF CONNECTION SPOKE ABOUT IT IS A MORAL ISSUE NOT A MATERIAL ONE AN OPPONENT SPOKE ONLY ABOUT THE COST OF ACTION NOT ITS BENEFITS THAT MEANT ALMOST NO ONE IN THE PUBLIC. APPRECIATED JUST HOW ENORMOUS THE BENEFITS THE END ARE ENORMOUS. SOMETIMES THANKLESS BELIEVE WARMING COULD REDUCE GLOBAL DP BY AS MUCH AS CENTURY. AND DECARBONIZING THE ECONOMY COULD ADD AS MUCH AS TWENTY TRILLION TRIPLE GDP BY THE TWENTY THIRD INTO ANOTHER START THE CAR. JUST PMR ELECTRIC JUST COULD ADD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION JOBS OVER THE NEXT. DECADE VERY LONG TIME WE HAVE RALLIED TO TRY TO AVID WARMING TO LIMIT EMISSIONS OF THE DAMAGES THAT INEVITABLY COME FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT% DRAMATIC CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE AND THERE'S MORE WARMING COMING WE CAN'T CONTINUE LIVING IN IGNORANCE. AND HOPING FOR THE BEST AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO BELIEVE. THAT CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE AVOIDED WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO ADAPT AND THAT REQUIRES SEEING THE PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING THE THREAT AND RESPONDING WITH KNOWLEDGE. THAT KNOWLEDGE ON THE FORECHECK THE COMES WITH IT IS WHAT THIS BILL PROMISES WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE.

PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ROOM SEEN NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YES I THANK YOU I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I THINK. HAVING AN ASSESSMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT I DO WANT TO URGE THE DOCTOR. I TO THINK ABOUT BEING MORE INTENTIONAL OR TALKING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE- WE BEAR THE BURDEN ON POLLUTION ALREADY AND WE KNOW THAT AS TIME MACHINE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE. THESE P. ALLEN'S GOING TO WORST IN THESE COMMUNITY I THINK IS THE EASY THING TO. ARE EIGHT ARE GOING LEAD ON THE- I WITHOUT A BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT IT TYPE THAT'S WHAT. ON THESE PA HAVE WE HAVE. A RESPONSIBILITY TO LAY IT OUT THERE MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED SEEN. THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND HAVING ASSESSMENTS- THAT SUFFICE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE. EVEN MORE BURDEN THAT I THINK IS OUT THERE IN SUCH AS LANKFORD. WORK WILL FIND THAT THIS BILL WHICH IS BUILT IN GENERAL AS WE TALK ABOUT. AS WE TALK ABOUT PRETTY MORE EQUITY IN OUR POLICIES AND OUR INSTITUTIONS OUT THERE BEING INTENTIONAL AND SO THE CURRENT CULTURE- IF WE LOOK AT THE PATTERN. WE ARE OFTEN AFTER THOUGHTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND WE DO THE MINIMUM- UNTIL. JUSTICE WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMUNIST AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL BUT- I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT. TIME BEFORE THE DISCUSS THE FLORAL HAS. NOT TOO LITTLE BY SPECIFIC FOR. ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITIES AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU SENATOR SINCE YOU'RE ON THE PHONE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES ALSO DOING ASSESSMENTS. HOW DOES THIS ASK FIT IN WITH ALL THOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO DECIDE LOW A LOT OF THE ANALYSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING ON SAY WITHIN AN AGENCY LIKE CALTRANS OR THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY OF OUR ENERGY GRID OR OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OR IT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT- NAGRA CULTURE IMPACT ON OUR CROSSES TO. OR W. THE RISKS TO OUR STATE. I THINK IT'S SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BILL DOLLAR ARCS TO PASTA IN ONE YEAR SUPER DISASTER POSSIBILITY- ALL THE ALL THE MASSES THAT EACH OF THOSE% AGENCIES DO DON'T END UP IN ONE INTEGRATED FORMAT AND REALLY DON'T APPEAR ON OUR BOOKS IN THE BUDGET. SO THESE ARE UNFORESEEN OFTEN LIABILITIES THAT WITHIN THEIR SILOS THEY ARE FORESEEN SOMEWHAT BUT I'M REALLY HOPING THAT INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT- PUTS THAT MATH TOGETHER SO WE DON'T GET BLINDSIDED IN A IN A BUDGET WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR HIT COMES THAT WE DIDN'T SEE COMING IN WE'VE GOT TO CUT. OUTPUT AND MEDICARE AL BECAUSE THAT WE GOT IT WITH A FIRE IN A FLOOD THE SENIOR. BUT THE GOAL HERE IS TO. TRY TO GO LEVEL TO REALLY FOR SOME OF THAT MATH IN YOUR DECISION MAKING IT INTEGRATED BASIS. OKAY SO THIS DOES SOUND LIKE A GOOD PLACE THEN TO INJECT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR ADDRESS IN AN OVER ARCHING WHY WITH ALL OF THE- OTHER AGENCIES BECAUSE THE AGENCIES HAVEN'T REALLY. BEEN WILLING ALWAYS TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND IN THE SAME WAY SO THAT WOULD BE I THINK A VERY GOOD CONCEPT TO AND INCLUDING. WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THAT AND WELCOME THIS COMMITTEE OR SIMILAR IN REGARDS TO YOUR OR YOUR- SUGGESTIONS OR THE COMMUNITY ITSELF- I KNOW THERE'S A LINE IN THERE. THE EMIGRATE VIEWS RIGHT IT JUST SAYS REPORT ON ISSUES OF STATEWIDE SIGNIFICANCE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS BUT- I THINK WE COULD BE MORE POINTED AND MAKE CLEAR TO THE- THE VULNERABLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE HIT SO. I WOULD WELCOME THE SUGGESTION EVEN BEFORE THE FLOOR OKAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE TO. TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU SO THE RESURGENT. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN THANK YOU FOR A- JOINING US TELEPHONICALLY I KNOW YOU HAVE A SOME PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENT YOU FROM BEING A BOTH HERE YESTERDAY AS WELL AS TODAY- YOU KNOW I WAS. IN MY OFFICE EATING MY LUNCH AND I WAS INSPIRED TO ASK THIS QUESTION THAT- YOU KNOW JUST CAME OUT OF THE BLUE BUT- YOU KNOW DOES YOUR BILL WELL WILL IT. THE SECTOR TO DO. ENOUGH DETAILED INFORMATION SO THAT WE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE STAKE IN OF OUR CLIMATE CHALLENGES I MEAN I AM THINKING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR INVESTMENTS. AND CALPERS AND CAL. AND HOW WE NEED TO HAVE. A MORE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF- PRIVATE EQUITY- EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOUR BILL WILL BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO GET US BETTER INFORMATION. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANKS FOR. TAKING TO COME BACK TO COMEDIAN DIGGIN ON THIS- I THINK THE BILL COULD BE. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC IN THAT REGARD- SO I'M OPENING I'M OPEN TO YOU TO MAKING THE BILL A LITTLE MORE GRANULAR ABOUT TRYING TO. ACCESS THAT KIND OF DATA WE KNOW THAT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR CALPERS AND CAL STIRS ARE STARTING TO DO SOME OF THEIR WORK AS SHAREHOLDERS IN CORPORATIONS AND TRYING TO PUSH FOR MORE DISCLOSURE OF CLIMATE RISK IN A NUMBER OF. LARGE MULTINATIONALS NOT JUST THOSE BASED IN CALIFORNIA BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THOSE PENSION FUNDS THAT ARE AT RISK BUT IT'S YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO HAD A FIRE INSURANCE POLICY WE WANT TO BETTER RIGHT. AND OUTSIDE. INCH MORE WE WANT TO KNOW. HE KNOW WHAT KIND OF A- SOME OF OUR LARGEST CORPORATIONS HAVE AND WHETHER THERE WE CAN KEEP LEANING ON THEM OR WHETHER THEY HAVE UNFORESEEN RISKS SO I THINK. I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MORE WE CAN DO- TO INSURE THAT WE GET NOT JUST THE PUBLIC SECTOR DATA FROM THE AGENCIES BUT ALSO- MAKING SURE GETTING THAT FULL SORT OF PICTURE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. C. NINE SIX ABOUT IT SHOWED LIKE CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE FOR MR STERN THANK YOU A SECTOR PLEASE CALL.

IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T AFFORD TO THE LAKE COMMONSENSE PROJECTS THAT CREATE JOBS REVIVE LOCAL ECONOMIES IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION CONNECT COMMUNITIES IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH. AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE TERM PANDEMIC HAS LEFT OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND FINANCIAL RUIN- WITH SYSTEMS EXPERIENCING DRAMATIC DROPS WE NEED TO TAKE A CREATIVE APPROACH INSURANCE TO ENSURING THAT PUBLIC MONEY GOING INTO TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

ARE THE BILL EXPEDITE APPROVAL OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS BY STREAMLINING THEM- TO SEE WHAT- INCLUDING PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE FACILITIES INCLUDING BIKE SHARE- INFORMATION DISCOVERY FOR PEOPLE WHO WALK BIKE OR TAKE TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY ENTRANCE A PRIORITIZATION FOR EXISTING SYSTEMS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS FLOOR TOTAL COSTS I'M HERE FOR SB Q. EIGHTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE BILL CO SPONSORED. BY THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND THE TELECOM BALLY LEADERSHIP GROUP. WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE SALE. OVER HERE THINKING HAVE TO TABLE AND TIME SENSITIVE PROJECTS ARE OFTEN DELAYED EXACTLY WHEN WE NEED THEM MOST. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE LITIGATION I'M TEMPTED TO CUT BY CLAN HELD UP THIRTY FOUR MILES OF BIKE LANES OVER FOUR YEARS. DURING THAT TIME NINE PEOPLE DIED AND OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE INJURED WHILE RIDING THEIR BIKES IN THE CITY. TODAY THE CITY FLOW AND PASTRY PROGRAM IS APPEALED EVEN THOUGH IT IS A CORNERSTONE IN THE CITY'S COVERT NINETEEN RECOVERY PLAN. BOTH OF THESE ARE NOT BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BUT ON PARKING AND TRAFFIC IMPACTS. SORRY LIKE THESE ALL OVER CAL. MORE THAN TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE I UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY AND THE COR AT B. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. I THINK IT'S VERY OPEN WE ARE THINKING A MAJOR UPTICK IN DRIVING AND CONGESTION NOW IS THE TIME TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN AND BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES IT SAFE AND CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE TO WALK BIKE AND TAKE A BATH IN THE BIKE ROUTE. OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR HEALTH AND OUR ECONOMY DEPEND ON IT. IF WE DON'T IT WILL CONTINUE TO HUNT STATES BLACK AND LATINO POPULATION- ALREADY SHOULDER DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF THE STATE AIR POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES. AND HAVE HIGHER RATES OF THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE. COVERT NINETEEN ACTUALLY DANGEROUS. IN AREAS WHERE TRAFFIC CONGESTION IS RAPIDLY RETURNING BUT THEY'RE STUCK IN TRAFFIC OR PACKING PEOPLE UP T THE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS UNFAIRLY IMPACT ESSENTIAL WORKERS ON WHOM WE DEPEND. IN CALIFORNIA THIRD OF ALL POTENTIAL WORKERS RELY ON TRANSIT TO GET WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT THE COURT CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY BY PROVIDING TARGETED EXEMPTIONS ARE TO GO UP TO COMMONSENSE PROJECT. I THINK YOU EIGHTY EIGHT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT PROJECT THAT TRULY BENEFIT THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT IT INCLUDES IMPORTANT NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMUNITY LED DECISION MAKING ON LARGER PROJECTS. LIKE ENSURING THAT PRODUCT BY THIRTY EIGHT COMMUNITY EARLY AND ANALYZE DISPROPORTIONATE BENEFITS AND BURDENS OF THE PROJECT THROUGH RACIAL EQUITY ANALYSIS. INCLUDE HIGH STANDARDS FOR LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SB TWO EDA AND NO COCKTAIL LED TO THE STATE SB TWO A COMPLETE PROJECT MONEY AND PUT PUT DOLLARS AND PEOPLE TO WORK MORE QUICKLY. HE DID BACK MAKE THEIR JOBS AND HAVE A FIVE TO AN ECONOMIC RETURN AND DIRECT AND INDIRECT SPENDING. WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR WIENER THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR WORK TO BE CALIFORNIA OUT OF THIS CRISIS.

THE HOBBIT OPPOSED TO SB TWO WOULD BE A ELECTED AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW LARGE SCALE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

WE REALLY APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS. YOU FIND WAYS TO MINIMIZE SB JUDY IT HARMS HOWEVER THINK I WILL JUST BE THE TRANSPORTATION JUST ADVOCATE. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE FEW LEGAL TOOL THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUTER CALLER HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT WILL NOT BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ANOTHER IMPACT. WE'RE CONCERNED. IT WOULD CREATE A TROUBLING PRECEDENT FOR ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT WE KEEP THAT PROJECT THAT SHOULD IN FACT UNDERGO FULL AND ROBUST PEOPLE PROCESS. THE POLITICAL PROPAGANDA THERE BECAUSE ALLOWED AJ COMMUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT. PARTICIPATE IN AND IMPROVE THIS PROJECT THAT WILL LIKELY IMPACT THEIR FAMILY HEALTH. AND THEIR ABILITY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CALL READY. A PUBLIC. AND VETTING PROCESS. WE DO NOT SEE THE NEED TO CREATE A SEPARATE PUBLIC PROCESS. MOREOVER A PUBLIC PROPERTY FORTY CENTER PROJECT ALMOST MEANINGLESS SENATE THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PROS AND CONS OF THE PROJECT. SIMILARLY ALL THE PREVIOUS AUTHORED ADDITION OF A RACIAL EQUITY ANALYSIS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CHANNEL COULD NOT BE ENFORCEABLE BY LAW IT CANNOT REPLACE. A PROCESS. OR STOP POTENTIAL DISPLACEMENT OF LOW INCOME CREATING COMMIT THE COLOR. WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS WITH AMENDMENT TO LIMIT THE PROJECT THAT COULD LEAD TO SOME OF THE GREATEST HARM. WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR SB THREE.

I WITHOUT WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER SAID THANK YOU. THANK CENTER WIENER FOR NOT ONLY. PRESENTING YOUR BILL BUT- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU BRIEFLY LAST NIGHT I RAISE MY CONCERN- SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT NOT ONLY. FOR POSES EXEMPTIONS FROM SEQUEL FOR PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE PLANS. BUT FOR POTENTIALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT PLANS. THAT SAY HA- ALSO HIGHLIGHTED- PROJECTS FOR THE INSTITUTION OR INCREASE OF. A NEW BUS TRENT TRANSIT. OR LIGHT RAIL SERVICE INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE WOULD BE RAIL STATIONS. IF THEY'RE ON EXISTING PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY- SO FIRST I WANT TO ASK. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN IN MY DISTRICT I I'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF EXTENDING THE L. A. METRO TO THE CITY OF TORRANCE ONE OF THE- UP POSIBLES AND PERHAPS A MISTER TURNER WITH L. A. METRO IF HE'S STILL. AVAILABLE YOU CAN CONFIRM THIS BUT THAT ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS TO EXTEND THE METRO LIGHT RAIL ON THE EXISTING. ARE RIGHT AWAY- TO GOING TO TORRANCE BUT OF COURSE. THAT WOULD RAISE SIGNIFICANT. CONCERNS IN THE COMMUNITY NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF. THE EXTENSION THE LIGHT RAIL BUT ALSO THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATIONS WHICH I WOULD ASSUME WOULD BE A- HUGE PROJECT- IN IN OUR COMMUNITY AND TO HAVE A WHOLESALE. SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR- THESE POTENTIALLY LARGE PROJECT. ON HI I'M- ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT IT INTO EITHER I'M MISUNDERSTANDING AND OR- OR I'M SURPRISED THAT IT IT. WASN'T RAISED AS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE- BY THIS COMMITTEE OR BY THE SENATE SO I WANT TO ASK THEM. IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY AND- AND- SO- TO THE CHAIR YES PLEASE YOU CAN THANK YOU I THANK YOU- SOME REMEMBER AFTER THE QUESTION OF F. SHOT. LAST NIGHT SO COUPLE THINGS ARE FIRST OF ALL THE BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO HEAVY RAIL JUST TO BE CLEAR- AND THEN IN TERMS OF LIGHT RAIL IT HAS TO BE AN EXISTING RIGHT AWAY. SO THIS IS NOT LIGHT RAIL WHERE YOU'RE YOU KNOW CREATING A NEW RIGHT OF WAY HICH YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY BACK CAN CREATE CONCERNS WOULD BE MUCH MORE DESTRUCTIVE IN TERMS OF OTHERS EXISTING USES. EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY ALL BY. AND IF THE PROJECT IS AT A HUNDRED MILLION OR MORE AND FRANKLY HAVING BEEN AROUND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS FOR A LONG TIME. ANY DIFFERENT THAN LIGHT RAIL PROJECT YEAH AND YOU. YOU KNOW IS. TRAGICALLY GOING TO PAST SEVERAL AND SO IF SO THEN IT HAS TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED WITH A E. I. R. AS PART OF A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN OAKLAND DOCUMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD PUBLIC PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THE I. R. AND POTENTIALLY LAWSUITS IN ADDITION THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE NEED FOR FORMAL APPROVAL SO L. A. METRO WHICH OF COURSE IS A PUBLIC BODY COMPRISES I UNDERSTAND THAT OF. A LOT LARGE ELECTED OFFICIALS WORSE IT WILL STILL HAVE TO APPROVE THE PROJECT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MULTIPLE PUBLIC MEETINGS AT A TIME THIRTY ONE FOCUSED ON A RACIAL EQUITY AND THEN TO PUBLIC MEDIA PER YEAR FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SO THERE ARE A LOT OF GUARDRAILS AROUND US AT IT I JUST A LITTLE IT WAS KIND OF SITUATION- AND I ALSO PURCHASED- PENSION I'VE WE'VE WE'VE SPENT ALL TOP SE HAN I RESPECT THE ORGANS AND TAKING THEIR BACK AND TRYING TO. MEET THEIR CONCERNS THE BILL HAS STRAINED WRIST I'M CANNOT TEAR DOWN WERE FROM PORTABLE HOUSING RENT CONTROLLED HOUSING- HOUSING- THAT IS RENTAL WERE YOU HAVE OF WORDS OCTOBER THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS WE DON'T BE A DISPLACING OUR PEOPLE OUR SERVER WHICH OF THOSE ARE CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY WILL CONTINUE OF COURSE TO LOG. SO THE- YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON SO. THE PROCESS THAT YOU DESCRIBE HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A MIGHT OKAY SENT INTO IN REDONDO BEACH- MULTIPLE HEARINGS ARE BEING HELD BY L. A. METRO BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN OF YOUR BILL HERE IS SET UP. IS THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC HAS HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO- TO HEAR PRESENTATIONS AND TO COMMENT ON THE PRESENTATIONS THAT YOUR YOUR BILL WOULD WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO CHALLENGE. THE PROJECT- BY EXEMPTING ARMED IF V. HELP METRO EXTENSION GOES ALONG THE EXISTING RIGHT AWAY YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN FOR ANY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CONSTRUCTING- LIGHT RAIL STATION IN. LIGHT RAIL STATIONS ACTUALLY THE TWO THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN AND IN MY EXAMPLE IN REDONDO BEACH AND IN TORRANCE- DONE THAT AGAIN IT IT SEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT- TAKE AWAY OF A LEGAL RIGHTS THAT. THAT THAT MY CONSTITUENTS CURRENTLY HAVE. TO BE A CHALLENGE- THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THESE PROPOSED PRICES. YEAH TO THE CHAIR- A COUPLE THINGS- THE GREEN LINE PROJECT- SOMEONE JUST EMIND ME AS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY EASILY GOING TO CATEGORY WHERE IT NEEDS TO OPEN A VIRAL CLEAR- AS PART OF A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN WITH FULL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS. AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A LAWSUIT IN ADDITION THIS IS A COURTESY CALL EXEMPTION IT DOESN'T BUY IT'S NOT A NEW PROJECT SEACOR CHANGE AND SO YOU CAN STILL APPEAL A SIMPLE EXEMPTION. YOU CAN ALSO FILE A LAWSUIT WANT TO SEE WHAT EXEMPTION AND THIS ALSO DOES NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AIR QUALITY STANDARDS- ANY OTHER EXISTING REGULATORY OR STATUTORY ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND IF THOSE ARE BEING VIOLATED YOU CAN SUE ON THOSE- SO THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO CHALLENGE PROJECTS WOULD THINK THAT THERE ARE ISSUES- AND BUT IT DOES MAKE THAT CHANGE- IN TERMS OF THE- THE WAY THE SICKLE PROCESS WORKS. I THOUGHT AN EXEMPTION TO SEQUEL. MEANS THAT IT'S NOT COVERED BY SEQUEL SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND I AND I- UGH GOING BACK TO MY DAYS ON THE SAN FRANCISCO WERE SUPERVISORS WE HEARD. PLENTY OF SYKORA APPEALS BASED ON EXEMPTIONS YOU CAN APPEAL TO YOUR ELECTED BODY BASED ON EXEMPTION BASED MEGA DOGLE CENTER BASED ON A FULL YEAR BY ALL AND THEN YOU IF YOU THINK THAT THE LAW WAS VIOLATED YOU CAN FILE. A LAWSUIT AND COURSE. PROJECT IF YOU BELIEVE INVITE VIOLATES SUBSTANTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL. STANDARDS IN OUR WATER. YOU CAN OF COURSE ALWAYS TO ON THAT SO. THEY BILL EVEN THOUGH IT'S A- ITS STILL PRESERVES A LOT OF THE POCKETS OF RESERVE POWER PROCESS- AND IT STILL GIVES PEOPLE- THEIR DAY AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE. INPUT OR TO CHALLENGE THE DECISION IF THEY THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH IT. THANK THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MATHIS.
