00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:23.621
WE DO THAT WE'RE NOT DOING AND

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:26.357
WHAT ARE BEST PRACTICES. BUT

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:28.259
WHAT I WILL SAY IS RIGHT NOW.

ALLOWS PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.235
HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO IF

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:39.437
SOMEBODY IS FACING A HEALTH

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.972
CRISIS AND WHEN THEY ARE

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:55.720
TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO AS WE-

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.655
START TO FOCUS IN ON THESE

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.657
BILLIONS OF HOUSING DOLLARS. I

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:01.759
THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS HAS TO

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:05.029
BE HOW DO WE TRACK USE DATA TO

00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:07.065
FIND OUT THE BEST WAYS TO NOT

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.666
ONLY SERVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.735
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:12.870
ALSO THE NEXT STEPS FOR THEM

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:14.639
AND RECUPERATIVE CARE CERTAINLY

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.274
IS PART OF THAT. SO I'M REALLY
