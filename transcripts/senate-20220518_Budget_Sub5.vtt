THINK FOLLOWING ALONG WITH WITH

THE L. A. O. OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:46.595

STILL BEING WORKED OUT AND IT.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.735
COVERS AND CROSSES ON A NUMBER

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:56.372
OF DIFFERENT AREAS- I THINK WHAT

IS BEFORE US MIGHT BE JUST A

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:00.242

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:20.129

HOW MANY PETITIONS DO YOU

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:31.073

SOME LEVEL THIS IS INTENDED TO-

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.889
HE BEAT THE FACT TO EXTENSION OF

PART ABOUT EDT NEXT IT IS AN I.

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.349
T. EFFORT AS AS LBO MENTION

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.717
THERE'S ALSO. A CHANGE

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.652
MANAGEMENT SIDE OF IT BUT THE

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.988
MOST. EXCITING PART OF IT I

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.823
THINK IS THAT WHERE IT'S GOING

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.625
TO BE MUCH MORE NIMBLE SO YOU

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.660
KNOW NEW PROGRAMS LIKE PULL UP

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:20.695
THAT CAME INTO PLACE NEW

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.297
REGULATIONS POLICY CHANGES. WE

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:26.267
WILL BE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENT THOSE

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.803
MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO IN TIMES

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.438
LIKE WE HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.506
THAT ASPECT WAS IS REALLY KEY I

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.508
MEAN THAT WAS. PART OF THE ISSUE

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.177
TO YOUR POINT THAT YOU MENTION

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.511
IS THAT WE COULDN'T PROGRAM

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:39.046
THINGS SUCH AS QUICKLY AS WE

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:41.082
COULD AND THAT'S WE HAD YOU KNOW

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:43.284
THE- THE WORD BACKLOG A WE HAD

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:46.320
BACKLOG ON. YOU KNOW FOR A FOR A

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:48.522
BIT- BEFORE WE COULD ACTUALLY-

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.658
RUN THROUGH IT SO. THAT IS

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:53.561
REALLY GOING TO BE THE- THE

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:56.397
MOST- I THINK EXCITING PART

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.632
ABOUT EDP. JERRY AND I AM THREE

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.267
FIVE FRAZIER THAT SO THE- THE

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.903
CONCERN I GUESS IS THAT WE DON'T

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.272
FIND OURSELVES. IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.474
THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS AND

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.476
THEN FACING ANOTHER SEARCH SO.

01:34:08.542 --> 01:34:10.578
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE KIND OF NOT

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:13.047
LATER THAN DATE DID DID WE USE

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:15.416
THE LEISURE YOU CAN ASSUME. THAT

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:17.284
THIS WORK COULD BE DONE TO AS WE

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:19.120
LOOK TOWARD YOU KNOW- AS I THINK

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.187
SOMEBODY EARLIER. IN THE

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:22.156

INDICATORS AROUND RECESSIONS WE

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:34.068
YOU KNOW NOT UNLIKELY WILL HAVE.

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.536
SOME LEVEL SURGE IN THE NEXT TWO

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.371

COSTING- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.144
THAT THE COSTS WERE ESTIMATED TO

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.012

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:34.281
ERRED ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION-

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.916
AND KNOWING BECAUSE THE PROJECT

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:40.120
BE A PHASE PROCESS WE HAVE MORE

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:42.990

DONE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.563
INTERPRETIVE PROCESS- SO WE'LL

BE ABLE TO MONITOR EACH OF THE-

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.002

CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:42.616
HEARD A LOT ABOUT DURING THE

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:43.917

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.097
WE ARE THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:58.198
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA

01:38:58.265 --> 01:39:00.067
DEFINITELY ROLLING DDT NEXT-

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.902
JUST MAKING IT EASIER MAKING IT

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:04.405
SO- PEOPLE RELY LESS ON THE CALL

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.073

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.241
LINKING INSTANCE THAT WE'RE

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:09.410

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:11.211
STOP SHOP FOR PEOPLE OF

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.814
REGARDLESS OF WHICH- PROGRAM

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.749
THEIR BENEFITS THEY'RE LOOKING

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:16.517

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.924
THAT BEING SAID- LANGUAGE ACCESS

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:27.461
IS STILL A HUGE. DEAL FOR ME-

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:28.195
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:30.931
BEEN WORKING ON SINCE I STARTED

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:33.133
AT EDS I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW-

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.135
AND THAT IS ALSO GOING TO- WE

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.204
ARE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:38.505
FOR CLAIMANTS WE ARE DOING FOR

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:40.307
EVERYONE TO MEET EVERYONE SHOULD

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:43.043

ABLE TO ACCESS OUR BENEFITS AND-

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:49.983
I THINK THAT'S THAT IS LIKE OUR

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:52.319
FIRST YEAR GOAL IT'S A BIG GOAL

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.021
BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:56.290
DEDICATED PEOPLE HERE EDT THAT'S

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:58.025
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:39:58.092 --> 01:39:59.793
HAPPENS. OKAY AND I'M SORRY IF

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.195
THIS ALREADY- I'M SURE THIS

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:03.764
ALREADY EXISTS BUT TO PROVIDE US

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.500
YOUR MENTION OF- MILESTONES AND

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:09.269
METRICS- I THINK YOU'D BE REALLY

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:14.708
GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATURE- A-

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:15.976
MAYBE YOU'VE- WE'VE ALL. AGREED

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:18.011
THIS A TO THIS BUT IT WOULD BE

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.780
REALLY GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:20.914
TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE CAN

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:22.883
EXPECT THE FIRST YEAR THE SECOND

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.652
YEAR. AND BY THE END OF THE OF

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.389
THE FIVE YEARS- BECAUSE I THINK

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:31.558
OTHERWISE WE HAVE A SENSE OF.

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:34.728

WHEN AND HOW WE GONNA GET

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:38.832
THROUGH THEM AND- I THINK IS

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:41.001
STILL ON EVERYBODY'S MINDS. AND

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:42.703
SENATOR JUST TO NOT POINT OUT

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.405

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:48.041
EXCITING PROJECT BUT- TO THAT

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:50.177

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:37.924
BE POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THIS

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:40.527
FUNDING THERE ARE ALREADY TWO

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:41.795
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN REGISTERED

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:43.363
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:44.431
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

01:51:44.497 --> 01:51:48.034
FUNDING BUT THE MEAN NUMBER OF

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.903
APPRENTICES IMAMS IS TWELVE.

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:51.271
WHICH BUT THAT SHOULD TELL YOU

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:52.872
IS THAT WOULD BE ILLUSTRATED

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.774
PROOF OF CONCEPT BUT WE REALLY

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.309
NEED FUNDING TO HELP THESE

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:58.078
PROGRAMS FAIL AND THAT'S WHAT

01:51:58.144 --> 01:51:59.412
WE'VE REALLY HEARD FROM THESE

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:02.048
PROGRAMS IS THAT HAVING ON GOING

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:04.417
FUNDING TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:04.984
AND SOMETIMES TO COVER THE

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.353
TRAINING CLASS IS A REAL CHEAP

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.722
BARRIER TO SCALING- AND THIS

01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:13.393
FUNDING IS ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.829
CHALLENGE GREAT OKAY WELL- YOU

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.764
DIDN'T MENTION SPECIFICALLY BUT

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:22.335
WOMEN AND YOUTH- I SHOULD

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.237
DEFINITELY BE A PART OF THE-

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:26.840
NONTRADITIONAL SIDE OF WHO GETS

01:52:26.906 --> 01:52:28.908
TARGETED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:31.010
APPRENTICES OF FRIENDSHIPS EVEN

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:33.613
WITHIN THE- BUILDING AND FIRE

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.116
TREATS. SO NONTRADITIONAL IS

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:38.485
BOTH THE WORK ON THE CAREER AS

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:40.520
WELL AS THE COMMUNITY FROM WHICH

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:46.059
WE ARE LOOKING TO RECRUIT- SO WE

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:48.128
HAVE ALL OVER SEVERAL YEARS FOR

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:49.796

FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS IT HAS

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:16.709
THE ON THE JOB LEARNING WHICH IS

01:55:16.776 --> 01:55:19.445
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND HOURS OF ON

ABOUT QUALITY OF. AND AS WE

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:52.078
REQUESTED FUNDING TO BE

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:54.080
INVESTING IN CREATING NEW

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:55.815
PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OF THESE

01:55:55.882 --> 01:55:57.050
DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT I ALREADY

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:59.085
TALKED ABOUT. WE WANT TO BE

01:55:59.152 --> 01:56:00.687
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:02.822
PROGRAMS THAT CREATE THAT

01:56:02.889 --> 01:56:05.658
ACCESSIBLE ON RAMP. TO WOMEN

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.593
MINORITIES FOLKS JUSTICE

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:08.328
INVOLVED PEOPLE WITH

01:56:08.394 --> 01:56:10.196
DISABILITIES AND OTHERS BUT

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:12.932
BASS. REALLY DEGREE BARRIERS TO

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:15.501
EMPLOYMENT AND SO. IN I MEAN

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:17.337
THIS IS WHY I DO THIS WORK I'M

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:18.905
REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT CREATING

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:20.807
THIS DIFFERENT ON RAMP INTO A

01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:23.376
CAREER. AND I THINK I. DS WE'RE

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:24.477
REALLY WELL POSITIONED TO MAKE

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:27.714
SURE THAT WE'RE CREATING QUALITY

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.216
PROGRAMS AND PART OF THAT IS

01:56:30.283 --> 01:56:32.418
CERTAINLY IN. SO HOW WE

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:34.454
STRATEGICALLY INVEST OUR TIME

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.655
AND ENERGY IN DEVELOPING

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:37.490
PROGRAMS I MEAN I GAVE YOU A FEW

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:41.627
EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS- AND- WE

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:43.162
WANT TO BE FOCUSING IN AREAS

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:45.064
LIKE HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC

01:56:45.131 --> 01:56:47.500
SECTOR AND EDUCATION. WHERE WE

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:50.503
KNOW THAT THERE ARE-

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:52.071
HISTORICALLY MORE WOMEN THAN

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:54.540
PEOPLE. OPEN WE'D BE USING THE

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:56.609
APPRENTICESHIP MECHANISM TO

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:59.245
PROCREATE ON RAMPS BUT ALSO

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:00.913
UPSKILLING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.148
EXAMPLE THAT PROGRAM I WAS

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.883

UPSKILLING OPPORTUNITIES SO IT'S

01:57:08.087 --> 01:57:10.056
NOT JUST ABOUT THE ENTRY LEVEL

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.224
IT'S ALSO SOMETIMES ABOUT.

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:14.193
CREATING MOUTHWATERING WITHIN- A

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.863
CAREER SO I THINK. THAT'S

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:17.930
SOMETHING TAT WE'RE DEFINITELY

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:20.133
MINDFUL OF AND JUST FINALLY TO

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:26.105
COMMENT. ON THAT POPULATIONS

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:27.106
THAT WE WANT TO BE HE'S- WERE

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.008
ALL OVER DOING A LOT OF. AROUND

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:31.844
THE I DON'T REACH COME AND WE'RE

01:57:31.911 --> 01:57:32.445
MAKING SURE THAT CREATING IS

01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:33.946
PASS FOR THE FOLKS. WE WANT TO

01:57:34.013 --> 01:57:35.148
BE SERVING THROUGH

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:35.715
APPRENTICESHIP- FOR EXAMPLE

01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:36.349
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:38.418
DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:39.285
ELEVATE A PARTNERSHIP

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:40.453
OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE FOLKS

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.055
THAT THEY'RE SERVING- ANOTHER

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:45.625
EXAMPLE IS LAST YEAR. SHOT D. A.

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:48.528
S. RECEIVED A GRANT FROM A TEN

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:49.429
MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM DEAL

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:53.299
WELL. AND HOW WE CHOSE TO DEPLOY

01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:54.300
THAT EQUITABLE APPRENTICESHIP

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.836
BRANDS WAS TO. CREATE A

01:57:56.903 --> 01:57:59.238
SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS TO

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.640
ENCOURAGE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:02.775
BOARDS AND THESE APPRENTICESHIP

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:04.343
INTERMEDIARIES TO WORK TOGETHER

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:06.245
WE JUST ANNOUNCED ON MAY FOURTH

01:58:06.312 --> 01:58:08.781
THE RECIPIENT ABOUT SO- WERE

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.082
LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING SURE

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:11.584
THAT. THOSE WORKFORCE

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:13.152
DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ARE ALSO

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:15.121
INCLUDED IN THIS MIX OF NEW

01:58:15.188 --> 01:58:16.289
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO THAT

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.890
WE'RE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING IS

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.959
OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. TO

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:21.828
THOSE FOLKS THAT REALLY THINK

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.362
WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THIS

01:58:23.429 --> 01:58:24.897
APPRENTICESHIP PATHWAY. I'M

01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:26.566
SORRY IN JUST THE FINAL-

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:30.303
QUESTION ON THIS IS HOW DO YOU-

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:32.238
HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT-

01:58:32.305 --> 01:58:34.240
THESE RAMPS APPRENTICESHIP

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:35.641
PROGRAMS ARE MEETING THE

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:39.645
REQUIREMENTS OF. OF HIGH ROAD

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:42.615
STANDARDS. YEAH I WAS THE BEARS-

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:44.016
THERE'S FEW DIFFERENT WAYS I

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.585
THINK I WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:47.186
TO YOU A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE SOME

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:48.287
ABOUT WILL COME INTO THE

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:49.856
IMPLEMENTATION LIKE THE DETAIL

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:51.824
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDS

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:53.359
BUT I THINK ARE REALLY KEY

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:55.127
COMPONENT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.496
FUNDING LANDSCAPE FOR

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:58.364
FRIENDSHIPS IS THAT THERE'S

01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:00.500
START UP FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:02.635
AND THEN THERE'S- ON GOING

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:03.736
FUNDING AND THERE'S REALLY BEEN

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:06.205
A LACK OF THAT THE ON GOING

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:08.074
FUNDING TO HELP PROGRAM SCALE.

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.942
AND ONE WAY TO STRATEGICALLY

OFTEN HOSTILE. YOU KNOW AND IT'S

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:03.527
