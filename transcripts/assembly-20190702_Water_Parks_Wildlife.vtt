00:43:59.203 --> 00:43:59.770
DIFFERENT.

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.639
THAN THOSE THAT WERE DONE IN --

RULES THROUGH THE BOARD OF

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.012

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:10.948
WHAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE TODAY.

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:12.116

RESPECT TO OCEAN RESILIENCY.

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.562

ARE NOT OPPOSING THOSE

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:27.998
PROVISIONS IT IS THE SPECIFIC

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:29.600

RAISE THIS NOW.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.745
BECAUSE WE THINK THESE ARE VERY

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:43.347
SUBSTANTIAL PROVISIONS NOT JUST

ORDER.

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:09.440
SO CALLED REDDITOR GAPS.

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.074
THIS COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.809
TRUTH THE T. H. P. PROCESS

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:12.976
REQUIRES REGISTER PROFESSIONAL

WE DON'T WATER QUALITY CONTROL

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.220
BOARD AND APARTMENT CONSERVATION.

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.855
THESE TEACH PEACE LAST BETWEEN

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:32.396
FIVE AND SEVEN YEARS COST ABOUT

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:33.831
DOLLARS EACH.

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.132
SOLD THEIR NOT INSIGNIFICANT AND

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:35.666
THEY MUST BE REVIEWED AND

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:37.000
RENEWED EVERY FIVE SEVEN YEARS.

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:37.868
THERE'S ANOTHER PROCESS CAUGHT

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.369
THE NON TIMBER.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.104
MANAGEMENT PLAN THESE ARE FOR

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.105
NON INDUSTRIAL CAM IMAGINE PLANS

00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:42.372
EITHER FOR SMALL LANDOWNERS

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:43.674
WHICH ALSO REPRESENT.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.976
THESE ARE MORE -- OF TIMBER

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:46.844
HARVEST PLANS ARE DONE FOR FOLKS

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.378
THERE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:50.347
BUSINESS OF HARVESTING TREES FOR

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.682
FOR PROFIT OR PRODUCTS.

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.217
THEY DON'T TO MANAGE THE LANDS

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:54.852
THEN USUALLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:55.619
HUNDRED ACRES OR LESS.

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:57.287
AND ASSEMBLY THESE LANDOWNERS

00:45:57.354 --> 00:45:59.089
ARE ARE LAND RICH BUT THERE CASH

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.557
PORCELAIN HAVE RESOURCES.

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:03.093
TO SPEND THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.496
DOLLARS ON T. H. P. SO THEY GO

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:06.597
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:07.531
DIFFERENCE THOUGH IS THAT THE IN

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.432
TEAM P. AS A ONE TIME APPROVAL

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.400
PROCESS IT LASTS FOR THE

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.402
ENTIRETY OF THE OF THE PROJECT.

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.704
AND LESS LANDER SUCH ACTION

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.072
HARPER STREETS THEN THEY GO

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:17.541
THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE T. H.

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.442
P. R. OR I NOTICED OPERATE.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.110
THE PROCESS DOESN'T END JUST

00:46:20.177 --> 00:46:21.278
WITH THE T. H. P. OR THE NTP THE

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:22.579
BORDER FORESTRY HAS DONE

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.181
NUMEROUS THINGS OF THE LAST TEN

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.916
YEARS INCLUDING THE THE SUMMIT

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:26.950
PROTECTION RULES.

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.519
THE ROAD RULES WHICH GET AT SOME

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.553
OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK THE

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.722
SPONSORS TRYING ADDRESS WITH

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.123
RESPECT THE SALMON PROTECTION.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.124
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN ISSUES

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.126
THAT ARE UNRELATED FORESTRY AS

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.295
WE KNOW WITH WITH DROUGHT.

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:39.329
THE MORE WATER WE HAVE THE

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:40.864
SYSTEM THE BETTER IS FISH

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:43.100
SPECIES AND THE DROUGHT WHILE

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.034
STILL A CONCERN.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.402
AND WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.603
THAT IT HAS IMPROVED THIS

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.605
SPECIES IN THE OCEAN.

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.240

PIECE IN THE BILL.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.055
BECAUSE THEY SAID THE T. H. P.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:40.837
AGREEMENT THAT HAVE IS IS IN AND

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.439
AND MAYBE SOMETHING TO THINK

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:43.340
ABOUT AS YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.975
IS.

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:47.944
ON THIS RE USE OF SETTLEMENT --

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:50.647
AB I WAS TALKING WITH THIS FROM

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:51.782
MY COLLEAGUE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:54.084
MULLIN LAST YEAR ABOUT WE HAVE A

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.819
HUGE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT BUILDUP

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:58.155
IN THE FEATHER RIVER. FOR

00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:00.757
INSTANCE -- OVER THE YEARS BUT

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.159
WE HAD A BIG IMPACT AS A RESULT

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:04.361
OF THE ORVILLE DISASTER.

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.062
AND I AND I THOUGHT THAT THERE

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:08.098
IS A REALLY BIG WIN WIN IF WE

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:09.566
CAN SOMEHOW GET OUT THAT

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.067
SEDIMENT BUILDUP.

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:12.502
THIS BEEN GOING ON IN OUR AND

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.872
AND SOME OF OUR RIVER SYSTEMS --

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.574
AND AND THEN RE USE THAT

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:19.176
SETTLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:22.312
BUILDING YOU KNOW UP COASTLINES.

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:23.747
YOU KNOW BEACH IS OVERSEEN THAT

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:26.650
SIGNIFICANT EROSION -- THE OTHER

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:29.586
IS EITHER A QUICK BARGE TRIP

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.955
DOWN TO THE BAY OR YOU KNOW SOME

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.056
WAY OF DOING THAT.

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.591
WOULD IT WOULD ALSO BE A WIN FOR

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:35.959
SALMON BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.728
PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS THE

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.630
SEDIMENTATION -- YOU KNOW IS

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:42.666
COVERING UP SALMON SPAWNING BEDS

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:45.936
RIGHT -- AND SO.

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:46.736
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE YOU

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:47.737
KNOW HAVE YOU HAD ANY

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:49.539
CONVERSATIONS ON THAT FRONT OF

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.675
REUSING I SEE THAT IS USING IT

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:54.778
FROM THE REDWOOD CITY -- BAY.

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.180
THERE BUT IF HAVE YOU CONSIDERED

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.949
CONNECTING THIS TO LIKE REDUCE

00:51:59.015 --> 00:51:59.916
OF SENTIMENT THAT.

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:01.918
YOU SAID IT MEANT -- REMEDIATION

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.187
PROCESS IS -- PROJECTS IN RIVERS

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:06.456
IN THE NORTH STATE FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.525
AND USING THAT AS AS RECESS AT

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:09.993
IMITATION IS THAT SOMETHING YOU

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.162
GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:13.430
IF I'M IN THIS VENTURE --

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.498
BENEFICIAL REUSE IS A IS A

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.433
TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR PROGRAM

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.801
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:19.135
PREVENTING COASTAL EROSION IT'S

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:20.670
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE WATER

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:22.439
BOARDS BEEN WORKING ON FOR SOME

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.941
TIME IN TERMS OF THE INLAND TO

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.443
COASTAL CONNECTIVITY FROM AREAS

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.811
AS FAR AWAY AS THE FEATHER.

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.346
UNDER FOR KTRE STICKS AND

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:30.780
UNFORTUNATELY AND KIND OF TOUGH

00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:32.382
TO ACCESS FROM A REGULATORY

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.384
PERSPECTIVE IT'S IT'S A DAUNTING

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:35.785
CHALLENGE ONE THAT WE CERTAINLY

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:39.523
SUPPORT I MEAN.

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.024
THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.225
CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN RIGHT

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:43.326
PERRIN INTEREST REAL AREAS AND

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:45.128
COASTAL ECONOMIES THAT THOSE

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:45.795
CONNECTIONS ARE DEEP THEIR THEIR

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.097
COMPLEX AND WE NEED TO BE DOING

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.266
BETTER -- I WOULD SAY THAT IS

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.434
THE THE HISTORY OF THIS BILL HAS

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.068
BEEN.

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:55.539
FOCUS AND AND AND REFINEMENTS

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.841
RATHER THAN EXPANSION BUT I'D I

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:00.510
THINK THIS IS IDENTIFYING A KEY

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.444
ISSUE.

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.580
AND ONE THAT WOULD CERTAINLY

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.314
LOVE TO WORK WITH THE ANA BUT

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:05.916
AND THEN I HAD ASKED THE LOOK AT

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.484
THE LOWER FOR THERIVER CORRIDOR

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.652
MANAGEMENT.

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.654
PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY IDW

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.989
ARE -- SO THERE'S ALREADY A PLAN

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:14.224
ON THE BOOKS ABOUT DOING SAID IN

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:15.959
A MANAGEMENT IN THE LOWER

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.561
FEATHER RIVER AND SO.

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:18.562
MAYBE IT'S JUST A CONVERSATION

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.931
AS AS MS FORD LIKE TRYING TO

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:21.531
MAYBE SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:24.467
CONNECT. TO SOME OF THOSE PLANS

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:27.604
THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE HAPPY

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:31.374
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION -- ALSO --

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:31.975
YOU KNOW ON THE HATCHERIES I

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:32.842
MEAN I THINK THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.911
WE NEED TO I THINK THERE'S MORE

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:37.080
WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE.

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.249
YOU KNOW BOTH -- YOU KNOW THE

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.051
THE SALMON POPULATION USING

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.552
HATCHERY.

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:44.654
USING THE HATCHERIES AND ALSO

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.956
BETTER.

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:46.957
YEAH -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN AND

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.491
THERE'S SOME MUCH NEEDED

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.193
IMPROVEMENT ON WHERE WE'RE

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.261
RELEASING.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.963
JUVENILE SALMON AND WHEN WE'RE

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.732
DOING IT -- AND AND AND MANY

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.334
PEOPLE IN MY AREA BEEN VERY

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.803
CRITICAL -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.805
THE THIS THE SPORTS FISHERMAN'S

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:05.875
ASSOCIATION OTHERS ABOUT THESE

00:54:05.942 --> 00:54:06.476
WHEN THESE ARE BEING RELEASED

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:07.077
HIS LIKE.

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:08.011
AT A TIME WHEN PREDATORS ARE AT

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.779
AN ALL TIME HIGH -- ME OF FOR

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:12.415
EXAMPLE IS STRIPER -- AND SO WE

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.184
YEAH WE LOSE A SIGNIFICANT

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.353
POPULATION THERE JUST BASED ON

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:16.987
WHEN THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.455
SO IF WE CAN DO THINGS TO

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:20.223
IMPROVE THAT I THINK THAT'S VERY

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.525
KEY.

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:25.562
AS THIS MOVES FORWARD -- ON THE

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.097
ON THE FORESTRY SIDE AND I THINK

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:29.232
ALL THIS ALL THIS COMES TO THIS

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.967
COMMITTEE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:31.935
WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON HERE IS

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:35.171
SALMON AND OUR WATER WAYS RIGHT --

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.840
AND HOW THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED.

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:37.774
RIGHT ALL COME YOU KNOW FROM THE

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.743
UPPER WATERSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:42.479
INTO THE BAY IS -- YOU KNOW

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.080
THERE IS THAT CONNECTIVITY.

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.949
WHAT I THINK WHERE THE A LOT OF

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:46.983
THAT WHERE THE OPPOSITION IS

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.351
COMING FROM?

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:50.453
IS THAT THE SEDIMENTATION ISSUE

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.322
IS NOT THERE'S NO DATA THAT

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:54.824
SUGGESTS IS REALLY COMING FROM

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:57.527
FORESTRY PRACTICES ANYMORE.

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.863
WHEN WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF?

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:01.398
NO TIMBER HARVEST.

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:02.032
YOU KNOW THERE WAS STUDY SHOWING

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.333
THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN A

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.268
LOT OF CHANGES.

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:08.004
AN WELL RESTRICTIONS LIMITATIONS

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.674
ON TIMBER HARVEST.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.275
AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.110
OTHER SOURCES FOR THAT

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:16.579
SEDIMENTATION TODAY -- YOU KNOW

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.847
ONE OF THEM BEING JUST YOU KNOW

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:19.049
LIKE WE SAID WE HAD THIS

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.850
DISASTER ON OROVILLE DAM WHERE

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.419
OR LIKE MILLIONS OF CUBIC YARDS

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:25.155
OF OF MATERIAL WERE DUMPED INTO

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:26.156
THE FEATHER RIVER.

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.757
RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:28.625
DIFFERENT.

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.427
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT --

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.695
CONTRIBUTED TO AND THERE'S NO.

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.763
DATA HERE RECENTLY SUGGESTING

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.599
THIS COMING FROM TIMBER HARVEST

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:37.267
AND SO.

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.002
I THINK ONE OF THE THOUGHTS WAS

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:42.105
WHY NOT DO A NEW STUDY.

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.573
YOUR OF HER KIND OF FORCE --

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.108
DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY TO DO A

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.843
NEW STUDY TO SEE IF THAT IS IN

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.279
FACT THE CASE AND OTHERWISE

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:51.915
THERE IS A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN.

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:53.750
PROSTHESES YOU KNOW PROCESS IS

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:54.751
ALREADY IN PLACE I THINK THAT'S

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.186
WHAT WAS BEING SAID A LOT ABOUT

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:57.387
POSITION.

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.788
THAT DOES CONSIDER ALL THESE

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.356
ASPECTS.

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.659
BEFORE TIMBER HARVEST PANT PLAN

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:06.162
IS APPROVED -- AND AND UNLESS

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.731
THERE'S LIKE A A REALLY STRONG

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.966
JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.301
YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE CHANGE

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.435
THAT MAYBE THE FIRST THING FIRST

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.870
AS A SAY HEY WHERE'S THE

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:15.004
SEDIMENTATION.

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:16.806
ISSUE COMING FROM RAY AND DO

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.742
THIS AND MAKE THIS MORE FOCUSED

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.210
ON THE STUDY OF THAT.

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:21.611
FIRST.

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.346
AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT THE

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.647
POLICY SHOULD BE.

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.816
ASSOCIATED THEIR WITH NOW I I I

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.218
SEE THAT YOU DID CHANGE THAT.

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:30.253
IN THE SAID.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.588
NO THERE WILL BE A STUDY IN A

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:32.655
WILL BE UPDATED.

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.991
ACCORDINGLY -- I THINK THERE'S

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.359
MAYBE SOME QUIBBLING OVER THAT

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:38.795
LANGUAGE BUT I THINK THE BIGGER

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:39.195
ISSUE IS.

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:41.397
THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:43.933
HAVE TO HAVE A EROSION CONTROL

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.337
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN -- SEPARATE

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.905
AND APART FROM WHAT'S ALREADY

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.841
INCLUDED IN THE T. H. P. PROCESS.

00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:53.176
RIGHT NOW AND MAYBE MAYBE COULD

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:54.577
ADDRESS I MEAN I I THINK.

00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:56.246
WE'RE NOT HERE TO CLAIM THAT THE

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.947
TIMBER INDUSTRY IS LIKE THE SOLE

00:56:58.014 --> 00:57:01.117
SOURCE OF OF SEGMENTATION OF

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:03.686
REMEMBER SAID THAT AND BUT I I

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.921
ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S THE CASE

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:07.891
THAT IT'S NOT A FACTOR -- AT ALL.

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:10.326
A AND SO AS YOU NOTED WE HAVE.

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:12.796
MADE SOME CHANGES IN THAT IN

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.864
THAT SECTION WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.432
THERE WAS OF THE ISSUE ABOUT THE

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.467
REORDERING.

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.202
OF WHICH AGENCIES WE'RE GONNA BE

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:22.739
IN CONTROL WE TOOK THAT AL -- WE

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:24.541
TOOK THAT SECTION AL AND IN THE

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:25.642
LAST.

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.644
AMENDMENTS.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:28.378
AND WE PUT OTHER MOMENTS IN

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:29.746
THERE ARE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THAT.

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:31.147
BUT I THINK I EVEN THOUGH WE

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.315
STILL HAVE OPPOSITION IS NOW

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:34.184
GONE FROM.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.152
OPPOSED TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.655
THAT'S PROGRESS -- AND WE HAVE

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:40.590
YOU KNOW BEEN WILLING TO MAKE.

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.859
A HAVE DIALOGUE AND MAKE AMENDS

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.994
YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN AGREE.

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:48.464
TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT --

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.632
BUT YOU KNOW.

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:54.737
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.673
DIALOGUE AND THAT OPEN DOOR.

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:57.707
RIGHT NOW AND I RESPECT THAT BUT

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:58.675
IT A WHAT MY MY CONCERN IS THEY

00:57:58.741 --> 00:57:59.409
SEEM TO BE THE ONLY INDUSTRY

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:00.376
THIS REALLY AFFECTED THOUGH

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:00.877
THAT'S WERE HAVING THESE

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:01.511
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ON TOP OF

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.246
WHAT THEY ALREADYHAVE TO DO AS

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.414
PART OF A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.982
LIKE FOR INSTANCE I DON'T SEE

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.217
ANYWHERE IN HERE.

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:08.318
NEW REGULATIONS ON THE

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.019
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.421
AND HOW THEY OPERATE.

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:12.889
ORVILLE.

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.824
WHEN I WAS A HUGE INCREASE TO

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.092
THE AMOUNT OF SEDIMENTATION THAT

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.694
WE SAW IN THE FEATHER RIVER FOR

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.663
EXAMPLE -- I DON'T SEE LIKE

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:21.764
ADDITIONAL REGULATION ON ON

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.967
THESE OTHER SOURCES RIGHT THAT

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.869
THEY'RE PART OF THE SOURCE OF

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.237
SEDIMENTATION THAT WERE SEEN.

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.738
IT JUST SEEMS THAT THEY'RE THE

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:31.975
ONLY ONE THAT HAS AN ADDITIONAL.

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:33.409
REGULAR WITHOUT REALLY HAVING

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:36.312
ANY NEW DATA. TO SUPPORT THAT I

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.014
THINK THAT'S MY CONCERN I THINK.

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.315
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAYING HEY

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.550
THAT THEY SHOULD BE REVIEWED IN

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.619
THE SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT OF WHAT

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:43.720
THEY'RE DOING.

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:47.824
IN TERMS OF THEIR TIMBER HARVEST --

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:48.691
I THINK THEY'RE JUST SAYING AND

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:49.759
AN EIGHT AND I THINK THEY WOULD

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:51.394
ARGUE THERE ALREADY IS A LOT OF

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.263
THAT GOES INTO THAT PLAN THAT

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:56.065
THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER -- BUT

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.433
BEFORE WE ADD A NEW REQUIREMENT

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.236
ON THEM.

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.738
YOU KNOW SHOULD WE HAVE A STUDY

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:03.473
THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:04.440
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE A SOURCE OF

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.175
INCREASED SEDIMENTATION OR THAT

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:08.678
THERE'S YOU KNOW A MORE RECENT

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:09.913
STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT.

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.881
IF I MAY THANK YOU FOR THE

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:12.482
QUESTION MISTER VICE CHAIR AT

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:16.552
THE THE FACT THAT.

00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:18.821
NEARLY EVERY SINGLE MAJOR AND

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.657
SIGNIFICANT SALMONBERRY WATER

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:22.692
COURSE ON THE NORTH COAST IS

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.961
LISTED FOR STATEMENT POLLUTION

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.195
ON THE THREE A THREE D. LIST.

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.197
IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.699
THERE ARE LINGERING ONGOING

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.100
PROBLEMS WHETHER THERE'D.

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:34.504
CAUSED BY LEGACY PRACTICES.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.272
OR BUY NEW OPERATIONS THAT

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:37.874
OCCURRED IN THE RECENT PAST THE

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.075
FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.743
AREAS ARE IMPAIRED AND

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:44.147
REMEDIATION NEEDS TO OCCUR.

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.748
WITH RESPECT TO THE POINTS THAT

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.850
THE WITNESSES MADE ABOUT SECTION

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:49.485
NINE ABOUT THE EXTREME HAZARD

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:51.154
RATING AND APPROVAL BY

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.455
GEOLOGICAL.

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.524
SURVEY THOSE IN MY VIEW OUR

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.326
TECHNICAL AND WE'RE I'M

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:57.627
PERFECTLY WILLING TO SAY THAT

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.028
WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.096
COMMITTEE STAFF.

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.931
AND THE OTHERS OFFICE TO ADDRESS

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.766
THOSE PARTICULAR CONCERNS BUT TO

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.435
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT EROSION

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.937
CONTROL PLANS OR ROAD IN CONTROL

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.172
IMPLEMENTATION PLANS.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.040
EROSION CONTROL IS IN MY VIEW A

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.208
CRITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.044
OPERATIONS THE REGION ONE BOARD

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.879
IS ALREADY MOVING.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.948
TOWARD THE PROCESS FOR EROSION

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.451
CONTROL PLANS IN.

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.753
TIMBER OPERATIONS BEYOND THE

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.387
SCOPE OF WHAT'S ENVISIONED IN

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.388
THIS BILL.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.689
SO THERE'S THERE'S ALREADY A

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.825
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD FOR THIS

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:31.961
APPROACH AND FRANKLY IN MY VIEW.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:35.131
THESE THESE PLANS ARE A CRITICAL

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.432
PART OF RESTORING AND

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.734
REMEDIATING.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.535
THESE IMPAIRED WATERSHEDS AGAIN

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:42.038
IT'S A SURGICAL APPROACH TO ONLY

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.940
THE AREAS WE KNOW WHICH SEMINAR

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:44.874
WHERE WE KNOW THEIR SENTIMENT

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:45.742
PROBLEMS.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.610
AND THAT'S IT THE HUGE

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.078
CONSOLIDATION REFINEMENT FROM

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.813
PREVIOUS LANGUAGE WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.049
CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE CONTINUE

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.284
THE DISCOURSE AS WE MOVE THE

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.519
PROCESS ALONG IN THERE JUST ONE

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:57.687
FINAL QUESTION ISN'T EROSION

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.922
CONTROL ALREADY CAN BE REQUIRED

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.091
UNDER A T. H. P..

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.292
RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT.

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:04.293
SO I MEAN DON'T THEY ALREADY

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.061
HAVE THAT TOOL IS WHAT I'M

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.997
SAYING SO WHY ADD ANOTHER.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.565
WELL IT WOULD IT IF I MAY.

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:10.666
MISTER RUSSIA I BELIEVE THESE

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.934
EROSION CONTROL PLANS WOULD LOOK

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.337
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S ALREADY

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.172
IN MANY T. H. PEAS BUT THERE ARE

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.907
MANY OTHERS THAT.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.575
COULD IN OUR VIEW -- HAVE THAT

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.711
ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF PROTECTIONS

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.246
AGAIN FOR THIS.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.848
VERY SMALL SET OF PHP IS THAT

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.317
ARE AROUND -- ADJACENT TO THESE

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.153
IMPAIRED SENATE BEARING

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:33.589
WATERCOURSES.

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.424
THANK YOU WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.526
SOME MEMBER GARCIA PAULA BY

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:37.760
MISTER MATHIS.

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:39.062
THANK YOUNG GONNA CONTINUE WITH

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.797

JUST SAID THAT.

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:43.066
THEY'RE READY IN THE PROCESS OF

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.101
THEIR READY DEVELOPING A PROCESS

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.602
AROUND AND THERE WAS IN CONTROL

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.771
AND SO ARE WE GETTING AHEAD OF

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.573
THAT WITH THIS BILL WOULD BE MY

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.275
FIRST QUESTION WHY DO WE NEED TO

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.409
GET AHEAD OF THAT -- THERE'S

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.845
SOMETHING OUT THAT'S ALREADY

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.281
BEING WORKED ON THANK YOU FOR

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.215
THE QUESTION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:01:59.282 --> 01:01:59.749
I'D I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.417
GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THE

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.286
REGIONAL BOARDS PROCESS BECAUSE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.955
THEY WILL IN REGULATION BRING

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.090
ABOUT THIS.

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.858
SAME REQUIREMENT FOR A BROADER

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.127
SCOPE OF OF POTENTIAL TIMBER

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.162
HARVESTING OPERATIONS BUT THESE

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.730
CHANGES IN OUR VIEW NEED TO

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:17.967
OCCUR NOW THE REGION FOR THE

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:18.901
REGIONAL BOARD IS.

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:21.304
DOING GOOD WORK -- BUT I THINK

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.206
THE LEGISLATURE BY WEIGHING IN

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.807
HERE AND PRIORITIZING THESE

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:26.375
SALMONBERRY WATER COURSES THAT

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.543
ARE ALREADY IMPAIRED SHOWING

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.645
THAT PROGRESS CAN MOVE IN A

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.680
PARTICULAR DIRECTION.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:31.981
WHAT'S THE TIMELINE THAT THEY'RE

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.749
EXPECTED TO BE DONE WITH THAT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.285
ASIS I'M NOT CERTAIN THERE IS AN

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.353
ESTABLISHED.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.521
TIMELINE FOR COMPLETING THE

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.589
PROCESS [inaudible]

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:42.024
AND SO.

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.060
YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT SOME OF

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:46.395
THESE -- HARVEST PLANS ALREADY

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.865
HAVE THIS EROSION CONTROL.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.899
PART OF THE PLAN IN THERE

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:52.568
ALREADY BUT SOME DON'T WHY IS IT

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:55.204
THAT SOME DO AND SOME DON'T.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.305
I'M NOT.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:59.909
AN EXPERT ON EXACTLY WHAT WHICH

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:01.677
THP USER TIMBER HARVESTING PLANS

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:04.213
HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN EROSION

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.382
CONTROL REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.485
SPEAKING THERE THEIR SPECIFIC TO

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.487
THE THE AREA THAT'S ENVISIONED

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:13.022
FOR HARVEST OF COURSE THERE ARE

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:14.590
THE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:15.958
TIMBER HARVESTING PLANTS THE

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.427
THEN TNT'S THE WORKING FORCE

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:18.961
MANAGEMENT PLANS.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.296
IN THIS TIMBER HARVESTING PLANTS

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.631
EACH HAVE THEIR OWN --

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.399
SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.300
UNDER THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:27.970
BOARDS I'M SURE THE QUESTION

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:28.571
WOULD BE TO WRITE ARE ANSWERED

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.939
BY.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.141
THE THE OPPOSITION.

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.676
YES THANK UP SOME IMPRESSIVE

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.912
SOLD THE IN TEMPE NON INDUSTRIAL

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:36.712
TO MOMENTUM PLANT DOES HAVE.

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:37.547
A LOOK AT A RUSSIAN AS WELL BUT

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:38.147
IT LOOKS AT IT AS A ONE TIME

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.549
BASIS IN THE ONE TIME APPROVAL

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:41.384
AND LESS THAT LANDOWNER DECIDES

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.985
TO THEN HARVEST TREES.

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.787
THEN IT HAS TO GO BACK AND REDO

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.790
THE PLAN TO CONSIDER EROSION

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.425
AGAIN BUT IT IT IS LOOKED AT

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.461
TEACH BILL LOOKED AT ALL THE

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.497
TIME PERIOD.

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:55.998
I THINK OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:58.100
T. H. P. ALL TEACH PLEASE HAVE

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.402
THE RUSSIAN CONTROL PLAN.

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:00.636
BUT TEACH PEAS COVER A FEW

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.004
HUNDRED ACRES FOR GIVEN PROJECT

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.006
THEY DON'T COVER ALL OF AN OF A

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.274
LANDOWNER'S PROPERTY.

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.411
AN NCMP COVERS UP TO TWENTY FIVE

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.111
HUNDRED ACRES AND A WORKING

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.747
FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN COVERS UP

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:12.448
TO TEN THOUSAND ACRES.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.083
SO YOU WOULD NOT DO AN EROSION

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:17.253
CONTROL PLAN TO COVER TEN

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.387
THOUSAND ACRES IT WOULD BE A

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.323
MASSIVE UNDERTAKING A LOT OF

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.158
COSTS WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS AN

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.659
EROSION CONTROL PLAN. FOR

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:25.861
PROJECT WITHIN THE INDIAN P. OR

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:28.097
WITHIN THE WFMT AND THAT'S WHAT

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.466
WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH IT NEEDS

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.867
TO BE CHANGES BECAUSE AGAIN.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.202
WHAT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT IS

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.904
HAVING FOLKS THAT ARE EXPERTS IN

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.339
FORESTRY TELLING US WHAT THE

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.841
RULES SHOULD BE WHEN THEY DON'T

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:39.542
KNOW THE RULES IN THE FIRST

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.810

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.360
I'VE SEEN THESE THESE PLANS AND

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:58.527
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.762
THE MALL BUT I KNOW A LOT OF

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.063
WORK GOES INTO THEN WE HAVE A

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.698
LOT OF EACH IS IS INCLUDED IN

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:05.067
THERE WE COULD IN THE GEOLOGIST --

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.669
THAT THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE AND

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.738
IT'S A PROCESS THAT WAS CREATED

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.640
BY HUMANS ARE BY NO MEANS DO I

PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE.

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.448
AND THERE MAY BE A ROOMS THAT

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.416
NEED TO BE MADE IN THERE BUT I I

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.051
DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:23.819
WE NEED TO SWITCH WHO IS THE

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:25.755
LEAD AGENCY WHERE THE GEOLOGIST

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:26.722
HAS.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:27.657

ABOUT HOW ABOUT THE ROLE THAT

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.544
THE STATE GEOLOGIST WOULD PLAY

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.547
IN THIS REVIEW OF LOGGING

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.417
OPERATIONS ON EXTREME -- OCEAN

ARE THESE ARE THE THE TERM IS.

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:02.458
DODD NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT

THE FACT IS THESE ARE AREAS THAT

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:04.093
HAVE AN EXTREME EROSION

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.529
POTENTIAL IF THE GEOLOGISTS

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:07.997
LICENSED BY THE STATE ARE

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.266

THIS BILL THAT YOU KNOW IS IT.

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:28.496
INTERESTING BUT ALL IT IT'S

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:29.964
DEALING WITH A REAL ISSUE I'VE

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.832
GOT MY OWN CONCERNS ABOUT IT

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.367
THAT I'VE I'VE SHARED WITH YOUR

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:35.069
YOUR STAFF -- I APPRECIATE THE

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.737
WORK THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO IT

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.774
I THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT APPS --

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.909
ARE OUT THERE THAT MAKE IT EASY

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:42.543
TO REPORT THINGS HAPPEN ON THE

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.311
ROADWAY.

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:45.079
YOU KNOW SAID ON WAYS AND THERE

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:46.680
ARE SO MANY OTHER WAYS TO DO

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:48.115
THAT AND AND SO I THINK THIS IS

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:49.817
A POSITIVE THING BECAUSE WE DO

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:52.253
WANT TO KNOW WHERE ANIMALS ARE

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.321
BEING HIT -- TO TO HELP WITH

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:55.523
WILDLIFE CROSSINGS AND AND

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.824
WILDLIFE CORRIDORS WHICH I CARE

01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:59.927
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT -- I DO SHARE

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:02.930
THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- WHETHER

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.632
THIS INCENTIVIZE IS ANY TYPE OF

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:05.766
BEHAVIOR I KNOW THAT YOU'VE

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:07.635
STATED -- IN OTHER STATES THAT

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:08.869
HASN'T BEEN.

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:11.338
A PROBLEM -- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:13.507
THAT A TAKING IS NECESSARY FOR

01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:15.009
DOING THE REPORTING.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:16.444
AND I THINK THAT THE REPORTING

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:17.344
CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:20.748
ANIMAL IS SAFELY -- TAKEN FROM

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.516
WHEREVER IT'S BEEN HIT -- AND

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.518
ALSO COULD BE -- IF IT IS

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:26.454
MORTALLY WOUNDED -- MAYBE COULD

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:30.291
GET BETTER CARE OR TREATMENT

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.525

NOT -- IF IT'S DONE BY BY

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.499
EVEN SAFER FOR PEOPLE ON THE

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.701

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.961
THIS BILL GO FORWARD BECAUSE OF

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.596
THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.031
KILLED OUR HIGHWAYS AND I CAN

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:44.798
IMAGINE.

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:47.368
OF A VAN FULL OF OF KIDS IN THE

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.637
FAMILY IN AND OUT JUMP TO DEAR

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:51.405
AND IT GOES OFF THE HIGHWAY AND

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:54.008
DOWN THE ROADWAY -- ANY COULD

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.976
ABORT BEEN AVOIDED PERHAPS WITH

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.511
SIGNAGE IT COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.079
WITH THE LIGHTING IT COULD HAVE

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:02.016
BEEN AVOIDED WITH EVEN EVEN A AN

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:04.485
ALERT ON A RADIO -- SOME WAY TO

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:05.619
ALERT THE FAMILIES AND AS YOU

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.554
KNOW WE'RE APPROACHING THE

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.290
FOURTH OF JULY AND AND FAMILIES

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.324
TO BE OUT.

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:10.891
IN AND OUT IN THE WILDERNESS

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.193
AREA SO IT'S IMPORTANT

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:14.895
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A PUBLIC

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:16.864
SAFETY ISSUE -- BUT ALONG WITH

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:19.200
THAT WE FIND THAT -- THERE'S

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:22.703
REASON TO TO TAKE IN AND TO FEED

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:23.504
A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE OUT

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:25.940
THERE AND IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.508
OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT.

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.577
FAMILY AFTER FAMILY -- IT'S BEEN

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.579
PROVIDED FOOD THAT THEY WOULD

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:33.681
NORMALLY HAVE SO THAT SHE ISSUE

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.349
THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I WAS

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.284
CONCERNED ABOUT AND I'M SURE YOU

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.786
ARE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POACHING.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:44.959
THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW THIS

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.760
BILL ADDRESSED THAT BECAUSE THE

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:47.695
COMMISSION THEMSELVES WILL BE

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:48.362
ABLE TO PIGGY BACK ON THIS THING

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:49.496
AND MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:49.964
HAPPEN.

01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.864
SO THE LARGER THERE SO WE TRY TO

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.600
GET ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT THAT --

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.134
OPPOSITIONS BROUGHT THAT'S WHY

01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:55.703
WE WORK WITH THE THE AMENDMENTS

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:57.504
AND SO ON AND SO I'M HOPING IN

01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:59.273
THE FUTURE WHEN IT DOES I HIT

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.674
THE FLOOR YOU'LL YOU'LL BE WITH

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.076
THAT ON ON THE ON THAT.

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.510
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:04.111
SINGLE BILL OUT THERE THAT'S

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:06.247
PERFECT BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.715
CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ARE PLUS A

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:08.949
COUPLE OF THAT OUR MINUS.

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.551
AND WHEN THE PLUS OUTWEIGH AND

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:12.786
THAT FOR YOUR VOTE COMES ACROSS

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.989
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

THANK YOU WE HAVE A DOCTOR YOU

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:18.025
HAVE QUESTION FOLLOWED BY MY

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:18.292
QUESTION.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.059
THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE THING

BILL -- BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:26.200
QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE IS THAT THE

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:33.340
WHEN THE THE ANYMORE SO -- HIT.

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:34.608
CAN BE SALVAGED BY.

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.677
UP.

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.479
THE A MORE TO RESTORE ANYBODY

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:40.848
ELSE WHO HAPPENED.

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.316
TO DISCOVER WHAT THE THE THE THE

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:43.417
ISSUE IMAGINED THE HACKED AND

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:44.852
TAKES PLACE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:46.487
THAT BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST.

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.055
IS THE TRAFFIC BACKS UP TO GET

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.556
IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR YOU TO

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:51.792
GET OUT OF YOUR CAR YEAH IN DRAG

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.127
THE ANIMAL ACROSS THE ROAD WHEN

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.061
THERE'S TRAFFIC COMING ON BOTH

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.664
SIDES YES THAT IS AGAINST THE

01:38:56.730 --> 01:38:58.232
LAW I WROTE SAID THAT.

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.234
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS SAID IT

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:03.537
AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SO --

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.806
THAT'S WHY -- IF WE CAN AVERT

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.641
THE ACTION WOULD BE PROACTIVE

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:09.410
HERE SO IF THE CITED WAS THERE

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:11.211
IN ULTIMATELY THIS IS THE GOAL

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.579
THIS IS THE GOAL. TO GATHER

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.481
ENOUGH DATA SO WE CAN CREATE A

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.784
BRIDGE WAY SO IF WE KNOW THAT

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.485
THIS HERDS OF DEER AND ELK

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:19.586
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE.

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.588
YOU CAN IMAGINE A V. SHAPED --

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.657
FENCING THAT WILL TAKE THAT THE

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.994
ANIMALS OVER THE THE ROADWAY AND

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.796
ON TO THE OTHER SIDE.

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:31.065
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MONEY

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:33.033
WE HAVE A TAPPED INTO IT TO

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.035
CREATE THAT BRIDGE WAY AND SO

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.804
WITH THE DATA THE INFORMATION WE

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.305
COULD SAY SPECIFICALLY.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:39.840
THIS IS WHERE IT'S HAPPENING AND

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:40.708
EVENTUALLY WE COULD HAVE THESE

01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:43.610
BRIDGE WAYS ACROSS THE STATE --

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:44.678
WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:46.480
WILL HELP FINANCE AND IT DOESN'T

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.782
AFFECT US BECAUSE IT IS PUBLIC

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:51.452
SAFETY AND IT'S HAZARDOUS AND SO

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:52.286
THAT'S WHY CALTRANS HIGH WITH

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.854
THE TROUT EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:54.421
WITH THIS.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:56.523
AND WE'RE GOING TO AVOID A LOT

01:39:56.590 --> 01:40:01.995
OF FATALITIES AND A LOT OF

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:03.964
INJURIES WITH THIS.

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:04.498
YES.

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:05.899
I DO REALIZE THAT THAT THE VALUE

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:08.202
OF THE DATA THAT THE LOCATION

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:09.336
AND ALL KIND OF BY ANIMALS AS A

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.004
TRUST SO SO THAT YOU CAN.

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:13.741
CREATE -- HIGH -- EXTEND EXTENT

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:15.709
AREAS -- CAM THE CONSIDERED

01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:18.979
DUFFEL WAR GREETINGS AND SUCH --

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:19.880
CROSSED ROLLED WHAT PAST

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.048
PASSAGEWAY FOR THE ANIMALS --

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:23.016
HOWEVER I'M SPEAKING NOW WHY

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:25.185
HERE THAT THE IT IS ILLEGAL FOR

01:40:25.252 --> 01:40:26.620
THE MORE THERE IS TO GET OUT AND

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.055
TRY TO MOVE US ALL I WOULD NOT

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:29.456
BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:30.758
THE IF I HIT IT.

01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:32.126
IN ALL.

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.895
BLOODY THING -- IRAQ KERRY SO

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.630
THAT'S WHY WHO SCHOOL NOSTALGIE

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.766
THAT ANYMORE AND THE COMMITTEE

01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:39.366
TO EAT.

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.834
ON SOME WILL CONSUME WELL IT

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.002
IMMEDIATE -- WOULD HAPPEN IT'D

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.470
GO TO YOUR CELLPHONE REPORT THE

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:45.873
COLLISION CALTRANS ALERTED HIGH

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.508
WITH CHOCOLATE AND ALERTED

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:48.776
FACIAL WELL GAME OF THE GAME'S

01:40:48.842 --> 01:40:49.276
ALERTED.

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.178
AND THEY WOULD COME OUT AND AND

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:54.515
THEY WOULD TAKE THE THE REMAINS --

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.583
FOR FOR THE CHARITABLE CITED IN

01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:57.651
FEEDING FAB CASTLE FIGHT HAS

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.887
BEEN IT WAS SELF PROHIBITED THAT

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:02.656
KIND OF ACTION WAS -- NOT ALLOW

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.625
THAT IS CORRECT I SEE OKAY NOW

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.260
SECOND QUESTION IS THAT THE UP

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:11.799
WITH THE A POTENTIAL -- DATA.

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:14.601
WITH THE LIMITED THE ABILITY

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:18.238
WITH THE NO FOUR ON ALL WHILE --

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:20.374
DEAL ONE NIGHT REPORTING

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:22.876
MECHANISM MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:25.846
LITTLE BIT THE US FLOOR WHILE

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:40.060
LAST AND ACCURATE THE HOWEVER --

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.763
THROUGH ROOMREMOVE ALL OF THOSE

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:46.200
SO NOT ANYMORE SO -- HIGHWAY

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:49.269
PATROL WAR WOULD OF HAD THE

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.804
ALREADY.

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:53.807
OUR INFORMATION OF WHERE THOSE

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:54.441
ACCIDENTS SO.

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:57.411
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:41:57.478 --> 01:42:00.347
HUMAN -- OF FATALITIES WHEN THEY

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:02.549
HIT THE ANIMALS SO IGHT IN ALL

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:03.984
THE YOU MENTIONED THAT OF TAR

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.953
PAPER WILL KILL THE IN A YEAR IS

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:08.322
THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER NAM NUMBER

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:14.928
OF A WAS SELF FOR ITO ONE MONTH

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:16.063
THOUGH.

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.698
OUR REPORT WAS OVER OAK SHOVEL

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:20.567
YEARS BUT ONE TO TELL IS ONE TOO

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:23.670
MANY.

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:26.139
YES -- ARE AND AND THEN ON WHY

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:30.611
NOT -- IF WE A NEW WE DIDN'T

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.112
HAVE THE DATA WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:32.946
SYSTEM THE COMMISSION DIDN'T

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:34.381
HAVE THE INFORMATION WE DIDN'T

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:35.048
HAVE THE BILL.

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.650
SO NOW WE GO FORWARD WITH THIS

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:38.418
AND THIS IS BEING PROACTIVE IN A

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:40.454
LOT OF A LOT OF RESPONSES BUT

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.322
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE THE BILL

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:44.658
WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR. TO BRING

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:45.826
AWARENESS HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:47.261
CALIFORNIA TO THIS TYPE OF

01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:48.996
FIDELITY AND I'VE GOTTEN A LOT

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.464
OF CALLS FROM MY DISTRICT WHICH

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:51.798
IS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES

01:42:51.865 --> 01:42:53.267
ORANGE COUNTY AREA.

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.002
THEY ASKED AGAIN WHY DID I GET

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:56.336
INVOLVED I GO BACK TO PUBLIC

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:58.305
SAFETY BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:00.274
AND AND THIS PILOT PROGRAM BY

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.909
THE WAY IT'S GONNA TOUCH SOME OF

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.977
THE AFFECTED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:04.711
MORE SO.

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.680
THAN THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.882
AND SO ON BUT SO IT'S NOT ACROSS

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:10.751
THE STATE TO THE COMMISSION WILL

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:11.985
BE ABLE TO CHOOSE.

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:13.520
THE AREAS WHERE THEY'VE HAD DATA

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:16.390
FROM THE PAST AND AND GO ON TOP

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:17.124
OF THAT.

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.659
SO THIS WAY IT'LL BE EFFECTIVE

01:43:18.725 --> 01:43:20.894
IT WILL BE UPDATED AND THE OTHER

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:23.297
THING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER IT --

01:43:23.363 --> 01:43:24.831
BRINGS A COMMUNICATIONS CLOSER

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:26.500
TOGETHER SO THEN WHEN THAT ONE

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:27.768
CALL GOES OUT IT AFFECTS

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:30.237
EVERYONE AND TO EVERYONE WILL BE

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:31.872
ACTING QUICKLY.

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:33.540
OKAY HELLO MY FINAL QUESTION IS

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:35.108
THAT THE IN THE STATE SO WHERE

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:37.144
ARE THEY HAVE ALREADY COLLECTED

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:41.748
THE DATA AND UP. TO A AND MORE

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:43.617
ARE COSTING COOLEY BRIDGES AND

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.218
THE SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.588
ABOUT FENCING AROUND US SO THAT

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:48.722
THE ONLY PASSAGE WAY SO.

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:50.157
YOU KNOW THEY FIND THAT THEY

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:52.793
MAKE CROSS SO -- DO YOU KNOW

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:56.897
THROUGH THE ANIMAL BEHAVIOR WITH

01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:58.599
A DOSE OF BREACHES SO -- ACROSS

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:05.739
WASTE WERE SUCCESSFULLY USED BY

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:11.011
THE ANYMORE.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.080
BUT WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'LL

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:14.348
ANSWER THAT.

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:14.915
AND THAT IS A IT IS A VERY

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:16.717
SUCCESSFUL MITIGATION APPROACH

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:17.818
IS TO BUILD LAND BRIDGES

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:19.720
WILDLIFE OVER CROSSINGS THEY

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:20.287
COME WITH DIFFERENT NAMES.

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:20.921
ARE THE FIRST ONE WAS BUILT IN

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:21.855
CALIFORNIA IN SOUTHERN

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:22.923
CALIFORNIA LAST OCTOBER -- VERY

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:25.292
MUCH UNDER THE RADAR BUT THERE'S

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.093
SO FAR THERE'S NO BIG ONE OVER A

01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:26.693
HIGHWAY BUT IN OTHER WESTERN

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.561
STATES ACTUALLY A PRETTY MUCH

01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:28.762
EVERY OTHER WESTERN STATE.

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:29.630
SET MAYBE ORGAN THERE ARE

01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:30.897
WILDLIFE OVER CROSSINGS BECAUSE

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.265
THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE FROM A

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:34.468
WHILE LIKE BEHAVIOR POINT OF

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:35.569
VIEW SO THERE THEY DO WORK

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:35.869
[inaudible]

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:39.272
THANK YOU.

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:41.208
IF I MAY ASK -- MISTER BILL

GATES TO ALSO CUT THAT PLEASE.

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:46.413
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ON ON WHAT

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.481
DOCTOR FRAZIER WAS COMMENTING ON

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:48.148
BUT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:48.782
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:50.317
AGENCIES CALTRANS C. H. B. AND

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:51.485

NOT REQUIRED REPORT AND OFTEN

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:56.590
THEY DON'T REPORT ON WHERE THOSE

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.258
COLLISIONS ARE TAKING PLACE.

01:44:58.325 --> 01:44:59.393
THIS BILL WILL HELP FIX THAT BY

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.061
REQUIRING AGENCIES THAT IF THERE

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.963
ARE THE ONES TO PICK UP THE

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.097
ANIMAL THE REPORT.

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:05.899
FROM WHERE THOSE SPOTS A RAT AS

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:07.434
WELL SO AND IT WOULD ALLOW

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:10.003
EITHER THE THE THE MOTORIST THAT

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.204
STRUCK THE ANIMAL.

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.607
IF IT'S SAFE FOR HIM OR HER TO

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:15.509
GO OUT AND AND TO SALVAGE AT

01:45:15.575 --> 01:45:16.943
ANIMAL ALLOW THEM TO BUT THEY

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.512
DON'T HAVE TO BE THE ONE THAT

01:45:18.578 --> 01:45:20.647
STRUCK IT IF THERE'S A A A A OF

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:21.948
FRESH ADAM ON THE SIDE OF THE

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.483
ROAD THAT THAT ANOTHER MOTORIST

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.651
COMES ACROSS.

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:25.919
YOU KNOW THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.120
SALAS AT ANIMALS WELL OF COURSE

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.056
BUT THEY HAVE TO GET THE PERMITS

01:45:29.122 --> 01:45:31.792
WHICH IS WHERE WE GET THE DATA.

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:33.960
RIGHT.

01:45:34.027 --> 01:45:35.595
WE HAVE QUESTION FROM US SOME

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.397

THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:39.866
ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRYING

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:41.134
TO IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS WHERE WE

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:41.968
MIGHT.

01:45:42.035 --> 01:45:45.872
SEE A SPIKE IN THESE ACCIDENTS --

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:46.907
MUCH IS THE ANIMAL LIFE THAT

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:49.342
WE'RE LOSING BUT THE HUMAN LIFE

01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:50.811
WE HAVE AN ELK AND A CAR

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:53.947
COLLIDED TO PRETTY BAD SITUATION

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:55.048
THE OUT THERE.

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:56.550
OFTENTIMES.

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:58.719
IN SO BUT THIS BILL GOES BE ON

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:00.220
COLLECTING DATA AND I THINK THAT

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.521
THAT PIECE AND HAVING THE AGENCY

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.956
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER IS.

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:04.424
AN IMPORTANT PIECE BUT THAT

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:06.793
INCLUDES THE TAKE PART THERE

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.095
WHICH I HAVE.

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:11.264
CONCERNS WITH AS WELL AS SIMILAR

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:12.666
TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.968
ITERATED EARLIER AND SO WHY ARE

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:16.670
WE NOT LIMITING THIS BILL TO THE

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:18.972
PUBLIC SAFETY PART OF THE DATA.

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:20.607
ON AND THE AGENCY SPEAKING TO

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.476
EACH OTHER I AND WHERE WE

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.578
INCLUDING THAT THE TAKE IN HERE

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:26.012
AND I'VE NO I'VE HEARD THAT

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:27.114
CHARITABLE.

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.316
DISCUSSION COME IN HERE BUT THAT

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:30.317
THAT'S NOT SUFFICE TO ME THERE'S

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:31.885
LOTS OF OTHER WAYS I WOULD LIKE

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.153
TO MAKE SURE HOUSING THE

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:33.720
HOMELESS AND HELPING TO TAKE

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:34.855
CARE OF THEM ARE.

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:35.756
PROVIDING THEM WITH JOBS THAT

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.357
PAY THEM A LITTLE WEIGHT AND SO

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:39.526
FORTH BUT WHY WHY NOT JUST

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:41.695
LIMITED. TO TO THE AGENCIES TO

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.130
TALKING TO EACH OTHER TO THE

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:44.865
DATA BEING COLLECTED.

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:45.999
AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY SAFETY

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.068
ASPECT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:49.903
CREATE BETTER PLANS FOR THE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:53.907
HUMANS AND THE ANIMALS ON THE

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.308
ROADS.

01:46:55.375 --> 01:46:56.343
WHAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:57.244
BILL IS THERE ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:58.612
BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.280
BRING AWARENESS TO IT IMAGES

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.349
OPENS THE DOOR SO AS I SAID IT'S

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:03.784
NOT A PERFECT BILL BUT IT'S A

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.986
DOOR OPENER? TO SAVE LIVES

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:07.687
PREVENT ACCIDENTS AND THIS IS

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:10.190
THE FIRST STEP AND SO IT IS A

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.558
COMBINATION OF THINGS BUT THE

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:12.826
COMMISSION AS I HAD MENTIONED

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.561
THE COMMISSION THAT WILL BE IN

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:16.096
CHARGE OF OVERSEEING THIS.

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:17.497
AND THAT'S A PILOT PROGRAM SO

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.633
THEY'LL THEY HAVE THE POWER TO

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:22.135
EXPAND IT -- IN AND SHUT IT DOWN

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:23.470
ON SOME AREAS AND EXPANDED TO

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:24.771
SOME AREAS WHO HAVE GOT TO GIVE

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:26.239
THE COMMISSION THAT OPPORTUNITY

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:27.040
TO DO THAT.

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.775
AND WITH THE DATA THAT COMES AND

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.110
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.812
US IN A REPORT BACK TO US AND

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:33.513
SEE HOW WE CAN EXPAND IT. TO GET

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.782
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.117
CERTAIN AREAS.

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:38.718
KING ANSWER DOUBLE WIRE WE

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.020
INCLUDING THE TAKE WHY IS THAT

01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:41.388
TAKE PART IMPORTANT THIS BILL

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:44.324
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIMITING IT. TO

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:44.891
DATA.

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:45.592
INTO CHILD HAVE TO HAVE TWO

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:49.062
SEPARATE BILLS -- AND THEY WOULD

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:51.498
EVENTUALLY JOIN TOGETHER YOU GET

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:52.132
PRETTY HARD TO HAVE ONE WITHOUT

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.033
THE OTHER.

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:54.067
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT PART

01:47:54.134 --> 01:48:00.040
THING TO ME WHY I NEED TO TAKE

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:03.677
FOR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:03.977
[inaudible]

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:05.245
MONITOR.

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.479
SO -- MOST OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:48:06.546 --> 01:48:07.480
ABOUT THE TERMS WERE USING

01:48:07.547 --> 01:48:08.315
CALTRANS HEATS P. IS REFERRING

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:09.015
TO STATE HIGHWAYS BUT THE

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:09.916
MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTS A PROBABLY

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:10.417
A NON STATE HIGHWAYS.

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:11.818
AND WE STILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:13.753
THOSE AREAS.

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.222
ARE IN THE MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTS

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.056
WHERE COLLISION WITH WILDLIFE

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:17.324
AREN'T REPORTED.

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:20.160
AND SO IF WE WANT TO FIND OUT

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:21.928
WHERE THOSE ARE IN TO DISCOVER

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:25.498
THE THE LEVEL OF IMPACT WE NEED

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:26.299
THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT.

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:27.234
AND THERE'S OTHER WAYS -- IN

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.369
SWEDEN THEY REQUIRE THE PUBLIC

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:30.003
TO REPORT A COLLISION WITH AN

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:32.339
ANIMAL BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:33.506
THAT IS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE A

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.908
VOLUNTARY REPORTING.

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:37.777
AND THIS IS ONE WAY -- I'M NOT

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:38.812
SURE WHAT OTHER WAYS THERE ARE

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:41.047
BUT THIS IS ONE WAY IS TO REWARD

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:44.651
WITH MEAT SALVAGING FROM THE

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:45.752
ANIMAL IT'S BEEN HIT.

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.053
AND WHY NOT JUST FOLLOW THE

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.154
SIMILAR PROGRAM ASSN FOOD AND

01:48:48.221 --> 01:48:50.724
JUST TO MANDATE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:54.861
REPORT -- I'M I WOULD THINK THAT

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.296
WAS FINE THAT'S A DIFFERENT ROAD

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:59.032
TO CLIMB -- AND MAYBE THAT'S THE

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:00.567
END OF NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.602
BUT IN IN OTHER WESTERN STATES

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.170
PROVIDING THIS KIND OF REWARD

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:05.639
FOR REPORTING HAS DOUBLED THEIR

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:08.942
RATE OF OF DATA COLLECTION FOR

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:10.277
COLLISIONS WITH LARGE ANIMALS

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.511
THAT CAN BE SALVAGED.

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.480
THIS IS TRUE IN IDAHO -- I'M NOT

01:49:13.546 --> 01:49:14.281
SURE ISSUE IN WASHINGTON BUT

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:16.516
CERTAINLY IN IDAHO WHICH IS THE

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:19.452
LONGEST RUNNING PROGRAM.

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:22.522
IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:24.758
OFTENTIMES LOOKED LIKE DOCTOR

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:25.959
SELLING MENTIONS.

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:27.494
YOU KNOW ON ON THE MAJOR

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.995
THOROUGHFARES ANIMALS ARE PICKED

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:30.330
UP PRETTY QUICKLY BY C. H. BEING

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.766
CALTRANS BOUGHT ON A LOT OF THE

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:34.367
ROADS AWAY FROM THE MAJOR

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:35.702
THOROUGHFARES I LIVE UP AND AND

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:37.370
ALTERADO COUNTY AND A DEAR WILL

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.538
LAY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:40.340
SOMETIMES FOR WEEK TEN DAYS AND

01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:41.374
SIMPLY ROT.

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:42.575
BUT WHEN THOSE ANIMALS ARE

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:43.743
LAYING OUT THERE THE ATTRACT

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:45.312
OTHER PREDATORS WHICH OFTEN

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:47.247
TIMES CAN CAN RESULT IN

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:49.282
ADDITIONAL ACCIDENTS AND SO

01:49:49.349 --> 01:49:49.816
FORTH.

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:52.552
SO GIVING THE THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:53.820
THE ABILITY TO SALVAGE THE

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:54.888
EDIBLE PORTIONS OF WHAT HELP

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:56.423
CLEAN THOSE ATOMS UP SPECIALLY

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:57.757
IN THE AREAS THAT ARE OFTEN THE

01:49:57.824 --> 01:49:58.792
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:00.694
SO THAT CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.628
BENEFITS THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:03.330
BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE ANIMALS OUT

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.965
OF THERE AND ELIMINATING THE

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:09.135
POSSIBILITY OF PRINTERS COMING

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:14.541

YOU KNOW QUESTIONS.

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:16.977
STREAMING.

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.678
NOT A QUESTION I JUST A COMMENT

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:19.846
PLEASE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.480
VARIOUS ATTEMPTS OVER THE YEARS

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:21.448
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:22.449
ANALYSIS -- FOR RELATED

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:24.317
LEGISLATION NOT NOT LEGISLATION

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:25.752
THAT DOES EXACTLY WHAT THIS DOES

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:28.121
BUT LEGISLATION THAT TRIES TO

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.490
HAVE CALTRANS TAKE THE REDUCTION

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:33.360
OF ANIMAL KERR COLLISIONS MORE

01:50:33.426 --> 01:50:35.929
SERIOUSLY. TO INCENTIVIZE THE

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:39.666
BUILDING OF THE BOMB WILDLIFE

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:42.969
CORRIDORS AND THE OVERPASSES AND

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.805
GIVEN THAT THESE COLLISIONS --

01:50:45.872 --> 01:50:47.307
CAN CERTAINLY LEAD TO HUMAN

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:48.908
DEATH AS WELL AS ANIMAL DOT THAT

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:50.443
SEEMS THAT THAT SHOULD BE.

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.945
THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE AS A

01:50:52.012 --> 01:50:53.113
LEGISLATURE ARE TRYING TO

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:55.115
ACCOMPLISH IS MAKING SURE THAT

WE DO BILL THE OVERPASSES AND

01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:58.952
THAT WE DO LOOK AT IT -- AT THE

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:00.587
DATA THAT TALKS ABOUT WHERE WE

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:02.188
HAVE MORE ANIMAL COLLISIONS AND

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.857
EITHER SLOW TRAFFIC DOWN OR RE

01:51:03.923 --> 01:51:05.592
ROUTE TRAFFIC OR DO WHATEVER WE

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:08.762
NEED TO DO TO MAKE IT SAFER. FOR

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.830
YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE IN CARS AND

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.799

ONE OH ONE IN LOS ANGELES WE'VE

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.701
HAD AT LEAST THREE MOUNTAIN

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:15.869
LIONS KILLED.

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:16.970
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.938
ALONE AND YET THEY'RE STILL NO

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.840
OVER PASS IN THAT AREA -- YOU

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:22.275

NOW DIVIDES TO SORT OF PUBLIC

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:26.112
WILDERNESS AREAS.

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:29.449
SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND

WITHOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:41.461

CAT THE CANALS BURTON FROM MORE

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:07.152
THAN JUST AGRICULTURE.

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:08.553
IT'S PART OF A STATEWIDE WATER

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:09.254
INFRASTRUCTURE AND DELIVERY

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.290
SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE AUTHORIZED

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:12.524
PURPOSES FOR THE CANAL IS STILL

WATER FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE.

02:12:17.429 --> 02:12:18.330
IN MOST YEARS MORE THAN HALF THE

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:19.464
WATER THE CANAL DELIVERS A

02:12:19.531 --> 02:12:21.033
SPECIFICALLY USED TO RECHARGE

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.100
GROUNDWATER AND NOT THE WATER

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.869
THAT'S BEEN BEING UNABLE TO BE

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:24.903
DELIVERED BECAUSE OF THIS

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:27.172
SUBSIDENCE PROBLEM UP TO THREE

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:30.742
WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF THE SIZE

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.110
OF MILLERTON LAKE FOR EXAMPLE.

02:12:32.177 --> 02:12:33.011
YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR TODAY THAT

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:34.546
THE STATE SHOULD INVEST IN THIS

02:12:34.613 --> 02:12:35.847
PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S A FEDERAL

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:38.050
RESPONSIBILITY IT'S ACTUALLY A

02:12:38.116 --> 02:12:39.985
LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY.

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:41.053

RECLAMATION SINCE.

02:12:52.964 --> 02:12:53.665
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT HOLDS TITLE TO THE

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:56.835
CANAL LIKE THE PINK SLIP -- BUT

02:12:56.902 --> 02:12:57.903
WE PAID OFF MORE WORKING

02:12:57.969 --> 02:12:59.504
AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS OBTAINING

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:00.739
TITLE FOR THE FACILITY SO WILL

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:03.408
BE FULLY LOCALLY OWNED AND

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.609
CONTROLLED.

02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:05.277
YOU MAY ALSO HEAR THAT THE CANAL

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:05.911
DOESN'T BENEFIT BENEFIT ANYONE

02:13:05.977 --> 02:13:07.312
BUT FARMERS.

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:08.914
THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER MOST OF

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:09.715
THE EAST SIDE COMMUNITIES AND

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:11.350
HOUSEHOLDS RELY ON THE SAME

FURTHER SUPPLY THAT THE CANAL

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.320
WAS BUILT TO HELP MORE THAN

02:13:15.387 --> 02:13:16.688
SEVENTY YEARS AGO.

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:17.522
THEY'RE ALSO AFFECTED BY THIS

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:18.924
PROBLEM AND WOULD BE HELPED BY

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:20.292
THE SOLUTION.

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:22.361
AS AN EXAMPLE TULAREID IS ONE

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.995
OF THE THE CANAL USERS.

02:13:24.062 --> 02:13:26.398
THEY NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE

02:13:26.465 --> 02:13:27.766
GROUND WATER QUALITY IN THE

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.201
NEARBY COMMUNITY FOLKY FEEL WAS

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:30.035
MUCH BETTER NEAR THE GROUND

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:31.403
WATER RECHARGE BASIN.

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.237
AND SO THEY PARTNERED WITH SELF

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:33.605
HELP ENTERPRISES TO PURCHASE

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:35.607
SOME LAND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:36.842
OKEY BILL TO ESTABLISH A NEW

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:38.243
GROUND WATER RECHARGE BASE AND

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:39.578
TO HOPEFULLY ACHIEVE THE SAME

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:40.278
BENEFITS THAT THEY'VE SEEN

02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:41.079
ELSEWHERE.

02:13:41.146 --> 02:13:42.247
THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF PROJECTS

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:43.448
THAT ARE POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW BUT

02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:44.983
WILL BE LESS POSSIBLE UNLESS

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.318
THIS PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED.

02:13:46.385 --> 02:13:47.452
FINALLY SOME CRITICS SAY THAT IS

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.254
THE STATE SHOULDN'T OR CAN'T OR

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:51.256
DOESN'T INVEST IN FEDERAL

02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:52.491
PROJECTS.

02:23:05.376 --> 02:23:07.578
CANAL IS USED ALMOST ENTIRELY.

02:23:07.645 --> 02:23:09.113
BY TWENTY AGRICULTURAL WATER

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.815
AGENCIES WHICH COLLECTIVELY --

02:23:10.882 --> 02:23:13.785
GATE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:17.855
NINE THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND --

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:18.523
AND THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:19.624
IT'S THOSE SUBJECTS AND THE FIRE

02:23:19.691 --> 02:23:20.825
WATER AUTHORITY THAT SHOULD

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:22.093
SHARE THE COST OF REPAIRING THE

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.195
CANAL NOT THE STATE REPAIRS.

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.596
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:26.564
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:27.498
THEIR DRINKING WATER BUT THE

02:23:27.565 --> 02:23:28.900
ANALYSIS IS PAINTING A PICTURE

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.436
OF A CANAL THAT'S BEING USE COME

02:23:31.502 --> 02:23:33.571
COMPLETELY BY AGRICULTURAL --

02:23:33.638 --> 02:23:35.106
CONCERNS NOT BY.

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:36.507
YOU KNOW MAYBE THOSE ARE

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:37.809
DOWNSTREAM USERS.

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:39.677
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY ARE

02:23:39.744 --> 02:23:41.079
WE TALKING WHY ARE WE NOT

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:42.480
TALKING ABOUT THOE AGRICULTURAL

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:44.015
USE WHERE WE TALKING KEEP

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:45.583
TALKING ABOUT DISADVANTAGED

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:46.684
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHEN THEY'RE

02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:48.052
NOT USING THE CANAL ACCORDING TO

02:23:48.119 --> 02:23:48.886
THE ANALYSIS.

02:23:48.953 --> 02:23:50.254
AND THEN SECONDLY WHY SHOULDN'T

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:52.690
THOSE AGRICULTURAL USERS BE

02:23:52.757 --> 02:23:54.158
PAYING FOR THE PROJECT.

02:23:54.225 --> 02:23:55.259
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH

02:23:55.326 --> 02:23:56.761
OWNS THE PROJECT SO WHY ARE WE

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:57.628
LETTING THE GOT FEDERAL

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:58.896
GOVERNMENT OFF THE HOOK WHEN

02:23:58.963 --> 02:23:59.864
THEY SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THIS

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:00.999
THERE THE OWNER OF IT.

02:24:01.065 --> 02:24:02.166
WHY ARE WE DIPPING INTO THE

02:24:02.233 --> 02:24:03.534
GENERAL FUND FOR THE REST OF THE

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:05.870
REPAIRS TO PAY FOR AN

02:24:05.937 --> 02:24:07.171
AGRICULTURAL WATER PROJECT?

02:24:07.238 --> 02:24:08.906
IF I MAY I'D ACTUALLY REALLY

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:10.375
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BUT I'M

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:12.176
NOT SURE THAT WE WROTE THE

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:14.178
ANALYSIS AND WHILE I TRULY DO

02:24:14.245 --> 02:24:17.115
RESPECT -- THE COMMITTEE'S WORK

02:24:17.181 --> 02:24:18.883
ON THIS BILL I WOULD HAVE

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.818
DISAGREED AND SAID THAT IT'S

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:23.221
BOTH THAT WE BOTH HAVE FARM LAND

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:24.756
AND FARM WORKERS WHO.

02:24:24.822 --> 02:24:26.824
ARE IMPACTED BY WHAT HAPPENS ON

02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:28.059
THE FRONT KERN CANAL AS

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:30.128
TESTIFIED.

02:24:30.194 --> 02:24:31.496
BY THOSE IN OUR BEEN EDISON BUT

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:32.263
IS NOW THEY'RE GETTING THEIR

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:33.631
WATER FROM THE CANAL SO WHAT

02:24:33.698 --> 02:24:35.299
HAPPENS IS THERE'S A HUNDRED AND

02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:37.402
FIFTY MILE CANAL TO GET FROM

02:24:37.468 --> 02:24:38.903
MILLER TEN LAKE DOWN TO

02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:40.638
BAKERSFIELD WHERE OUR COLLEAGUE

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:42.507
IN THE SOUTH IS FROM.

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:44.208
AND ROUGHLY ABOUT AT ABOUT MILE

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:45.343
MARKER ONE HUNDRED THERE

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:47.078
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH SUBSIDENCE

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:48.780
THAT IT'S DECREASING CAPACITY

02:24:48.846 --> 02:24:50.048
DUE.

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:51.649
TO THE COUNTY ROADS THAT ARE

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:54.385
OVER LYING AT NOT ALLOWING IT TO

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:56.621
BE FILLED FULLY NOW I WOULD LOVE

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:58.189
TO INVITE YOU DOWN AND SHOW YOU

02:24:58.256 --> 02:24:59.757
AT FIRST HAND BECAUSE WHAT

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:02.160
OCCURS IS BY THE DECREASE IN

02:25:02.226 --> 02:25:03.661
CAPACITY IT LEADS TO US NOT

02:25:03.728 --> 02:25:04.862
BEING ABLE TO HAVE

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:06.230
SUSTAINABILITY.

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:09.967
IF I CAN'T GET THE WATER TURNED

02:25:10.034 --> 02:25:10.968
TO WHERE WE'RE DOING RECHARGE.

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.770
I CAN'T HAVE LONG TERM

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:18.176
SUSTAINABILITY IN THE VALLEY BUT

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:18.709
AND THAT'S IT THIS IS THE

02:25:18.776 --> 02:25:19.343
PROJECT GOING TO NOW BRING CLEAN

02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:20.178
WATER TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:21.012
KEEP MENTIONING BECAUSE IT'S

02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:22.547
READS AS THOUGH THIS IS GOING TO

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:23.714
FARMS NO THIS IS

02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:24.449
YET AND WE TALKED ABOUT ORANGE

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:25.283
COVE AND THE MAYOR OF ORANGE

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:26.651
COVE IS WHICH IS ON THE EAST

02:25:26.717 --> 02:25:27.819
SIDE IS.

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:30.488
MAYOR VICTOR LOPEZ DAME RELY

02:25:30.555 --> 02:25:31.989
UPON THE WATER FROM THE FRONT

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:33.758
KERN CANAL FOR THEIR CLEAN

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.193
DRINKING WATER.

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:37.462
WITHOUT THAT ABILITY OF HAVING

02:25:37.528 --> 02:25:38.930
THE FRONT KERN CANAL IN THAT

02:25:38.996 --> 02:25:40.598
CAPACITY WE'RE GOING TO AFFECT

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:41.432
AREAS.

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:44.936
LIKE EAST PORTER FELL AND OTHER

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:47.538
AREAS IN THE VALLEY AND SO I'M --

02:25:47.605 --> 02:25:48.573
I'LL PROBABLY TO STOP SERAPHINA

02:25:48.639 --> 02:25:49.874
MIGHT FOR THEN I WOULD ASK --

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:52.877
STAFF TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:53.778
IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEIR

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:57.682
ANALYSIS IS AND CRACKED I'D LIKE

02:25:57.748 --> 02:25:58.850
TO COME HERE THEIR RESPONSE TO

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.151
THAT.

02:26:00.218 --> 02:26:01.752
OKAY AND THEN AND THEN I WILL

02:26:01.819 --> 02:26:03.087
ALSO -- ASKED IF I MAY MISTER

02:26:03.154 --> 02:26:05.289
CHAIR MAYBE COULD ANSWER SOME A

02:26:05.356 --> 02:26:06.757
MISREAD BINS CONCERNS IT'S LOW

02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:08.459
LET'S FINISH YOUR QUESTIONS AND

02:26:08.526 --> 02:26:10.928
THEN I'LL ALLOW EITHER THE

02:26:10.995 --> 02:26:11.562
WITNESSES ARE YOURSELF AND THEN

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:12.497
AND I'M GONNA READ AGAIN FROM

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.332
THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

02:26:14.398 --> 02:26:15.867
I HAVE YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW TO

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:16.767
BASE MY DECISION.

02:26:16.834 --> 02:26:18.936
ON IT SAYS THE FRONT WATER

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:20.438
AUTHORITY HAS A CONTRACT WITH

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:22.006
THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:23.474
TO MAINTAIN THE CANAL INCLUDING

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:24.075
HEAVY MAINTENANCE OF THE KIND

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:24.675
NEEDED.

02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:26.210
CURRENT PULMONARY ESTIMATES FOR

02:26:26.277 --> 02:26:27.478
THE FULL RESTORATION OF THE

02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:28.379
CANNELLA ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:29.547
MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE FRYING

02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:31.249
DIVISION OF THE CV P. AMOUNTS

02:26:31.315 --> 02:26:32.416
FOR MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:33.551
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:34.218
ACRE.

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:35.453
THIS IS NOT A HEAVY BURDEN I

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:37.021
WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LIGHT BURDEN

02:26:37.088 --> 02:26:38.623
FOR REGION GROWING HIGH VALUE

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:40.224
ORCHARDS AND OTHER CROPS IT IS

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:41.792
MORE THAN REASONABLE TO REQUEST

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:43.494
THAT YOU SB ARE IN FRONT WORK

02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:44.795
TOGETHER TO RESTORE THE FRANK

02:26:44.862 --> 02:26:45.930
KERN CANAL.

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:47.165
ANY DELAY.

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.167
OR AVOIDANCE UNDERTAKING THE

02:26:49.233 --> 02:26:49.600
RIGHT.

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.269
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CANAL

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:52.870
UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:53.905
TAB MILLION MERELY ILLUSTRATES

02:26:53.971 --> 02:26:55.373
THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

02:26:55.439 --> 02:26:55.940
NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO WITH

02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:57.441
URGENCY NOW THAT THEY'RE SAYING

02:26:57.508 --> 02:27:00.578
THAT THE ARGUMENT IN OPPOSITION --

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:01.712
I THINK STAFF IS JUST.

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:02.747
I DON'T IN THAT THEY'RE ARGUING

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:04.081
THAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT'S WHAT

02:27:04.148 --> 02:27:04.949
PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED AGAINST IT

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:06.217
THAT'S GREAT SO I AM CONCERNED

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:08.019
THAT WERE NOW USING TAXPAYER

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:09.921
MONEY. TO BAIL OUT THESE VERY

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:12.590
LARGE AGRICULTURAL AND I LOVE I

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:14.125
LOVE CROPS AND I LOVE FARMS BUT

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:15.092
IF THEY'RE GROWING HIGH VALUE

02:27:15.159 --> 02:27:16.360
CROPS AND ARE CAPABLE OF DOING

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:18.095
THIS FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

02:27:18.162 --> 02:27:21.265
ACRE -- WHY DO WE THEN HAVE TO

02:27:21.332 --> 02:27:23.467
TAKE MONEY FROM THE TAXPAYERS

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:24.735
WHO COULD BE INVESTING IN AREAS

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:25.870
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:27.471
ABILITY TO HAVE YOU KNOW LARGE

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:29.140
INDUSTRY COME IN AND HELP THEM

02:27:29.207 --> 02:27:31.509
AND IF IF I MAY AND?

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:37.315
CANNOT KEEP PACE THROUGH YOU

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:38.883
MISTER CHAIR -- I THINK THERE

02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.785
NEEDS TO BE COLLABORATION AND

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:41.385
FOR US TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WE

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:42.486
CAN'T KEEP KICKING THIS CAN DOWN

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:45.656
THE ROAD AND FOR TOO MANY YEARS

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:47.325
WE HAVE SPENT.

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:50.428
MONEY LOCALLY UP TO A BILLION

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:52.029
DOLLARS TO HELP TO REPAIR IT.

02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:53.664
THERE LOCAL LEGISLATORS ARE NOW

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:55.466
ASKING FOR SOME STATE SUPPORT AS

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:57.802
WELL BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT

02:27:57.868 --> 02:27:59.203
WE'RE CURRENTLY AND SO THE

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:01.439
AGRICULTURAL THOSE FARMS AND FRY

02:28:01.505 --> 02:28:02.540
AND IT'S ALL FOR THEY ALSO

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:04.942
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD OR

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:06.344
THE INVESTING.

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:07.878
I'M HAPPY TO STEP IN HERE AND

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:10.748
ADD A COUPLE DATA POINTS -- SO I

02:28:10.815 --> 02:28:11.749
JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO ONE

02:28:11.816 --> 02:28:13.251
THING THAT YOU SAID EARLIER

02:28:13.317 --> 02:28:14.452
MISTER YOU'RE NOT MISS FRIEDMAN

02:28:14.518 --> 02:28:16.120
ABOUT -- YOUR QUESTION ON WHO IS

02:28:16.187 --> 02:28:18.322
REALLY BENEFITING AND DOES THIS

02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:20.424
ACTUALLY HELP -- COMMUNITIES

02:28:20.491 --> 02:28:21.959
THERE AND HOW THEY RELATE AND

02:28:22.026 --> 02:28:22.560
GROUND WATER.

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:24.295
THE ONE OF THE GREATEST

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:25.830
TRAGEDIES OF THIS PROBLEM RIGHT

02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:26.964
NOW IS THAT.

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:28.599
THE WATER THAT CAN'T BE

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:31.802
DELIVERED IS ENTIRELY TO BE USED

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:33.237
FOR RECHARGE SO.

02:28:33.304 --> 02:28:34.538
ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR

02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:36.240
RELYING ON GROUNDWATER AQUIFER'S

02:28:36.307 --> 02:28:38.009
THAT THIS CANNELLA SUSTAIN FOR

02:28:38.075 --> 02:28:38.976
SEVENTY YEARS.

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:40.878
ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BECAUSE

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:41.979
THAT'S THE WATER THEY CAN'T BE

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:43.014
DELIVERED SO THERE'S STILL SOME

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.382
WATER IS BEING DELIVERED FOR AG

02:28:44.448 --> 02:28:45.616
USERS.

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:46.450
BUT THE WATER THAT THEY WOULD

02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:47.685
GENERALLY TAKE WHEN IT'S A

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:48.686
REALLY HIGH FLOW CONDITION AND

02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:50.221
JUST SINK DOWN TO THE GROUND

02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:51.455
THEY CAN'T TAKE.

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:52.890

OUT HOW TO PAY FOR REPAIRS TO

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:28.565
THAT WE ARE NOT LOSING 60% BUT

02:38:28.632 --> 02:38:30.300
WHATEVER WE'RE LOSING.

02:38:30.367 --> 02:38:31.702
OUT THEIR OWN AND THAT WE DON'T

02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:32.803
RUN INTO THIS CONSERVE INTO WE

02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:33.437
DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS

02:38:33.503 --> 02:38:34.838
ANYMORE.

02:38:34.905 --> 02:38:36.807

THE COMMUNITIES KIND OF AT THE

02:38:43.313 --> 02:38:44.414

FOR STRUCTURE -- AND I THINK

02:38:53.824 --> 02:38:55.025
IT'S THE BIGGER DISCUSSION OF

02:38:55.092 --> 02:38:57.094
