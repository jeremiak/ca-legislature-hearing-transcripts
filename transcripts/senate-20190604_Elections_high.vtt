HERTZBERG AND WILL TAKE IT OFF

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:11.857
THERE'S JUST A MOST OF OUR

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:12.992
HISTORY PEOPLE DID LIVE WITH

00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:15.861
THEIR WORK YOU KNOW THE WALK UPS

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.229
AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.964
HE WAS DESTINY IS BORN INTO

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.266
PLACES EMPHASIS GOERS PARENTS

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:23.302
LIVED IN THE ON THE SAME SIDE

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.970
THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY -- I'M

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:25.604
JUST WONDER WHAT THE REASON FOR

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:26.405
THE RULE WAS TO SEPARATE AS LONG

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.275
AS YOU LIVE IN THE SAME

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.609
JURISDICTION I EAT ARE QUITE

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.111
FRANKLY USED TO REGISTER MY LAW

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:32.811
OFFICE.

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.380
BUT MY LAW OFFICES TWO BLOCKS

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:37.683
AWAY FROM WHERE BY APARTMENT WAS

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.085
AND IT WAS THE SAME JURISDICTION

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:41.487
SO I JUST MAYES SAMPRAS LIKE

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:42.721
GETTING ALL MY MAIL IN ONE PLACE.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:44.523
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE AS

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.525
LONG AS YOU'RE NOT?

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.993
MR DISTINCTION -- DIFFERENCES

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.228
SEEMS TO ME AND AND YOU KNOW

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.429
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE FUTURE

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.764
IN A SENSE OF THESE THINGS WE

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.865
MAKE THESE EXAMPLES I MEAN THIS

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:54.900
IS BEEN SO MUCH OF HOW WE'VE

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.336
LIVED OUR LIVES AS ONE WHEN THE

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.271
LAW WAS CHANGED IS KIND OF

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.774
INTERESTING TO ME.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.510
WE ARE TRYING TO PHONY ANYBODY

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:04.977

SO WHILE I DON'T WANNA --

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:07.947
SUGGEST TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT A

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.315

ESPECIALLY TO RUN FOR OFFICE

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.632
BECAUSE OUR BUSINESSES THERE BUT

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.400
THE REALITIES OF TODAY'S WORLD

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:31.837
IS THAT WE DO ONCE AGAIN -- AT

SIX NINETY SIX SEVENTY NINE WE

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.397
BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD FACILITATE

00:14:58.464 --> 00:14:59.965
UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:28.927
THOSE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.562
WHEN A PERSON SEPARATES FROM THE
