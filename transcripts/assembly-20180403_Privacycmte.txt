DESPITE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIREMENT THAT SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES BE AFFIXED TO NEW MOTORCYCLE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO STANDARD PRACTICE FOR HER MOTORCYCLE PRICES PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC. AS A RESULT PRICES OF MOTORCYCLE MAKE AND MODEL CAN VARY GREATLY FROM DEALERSHIP TO DEALERSHIPS STATEWIDE. AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN IS SPONSORED BY THE MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S A BENEFIT TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND TO THE DEALERS FOR THE MANUFACTURER'S PRICE AND A DEALERS OUT ON SUBJECT TO BE DISPLAYED.

STATUTORY ABILITY TO REGULATE AND TO REQUIRE THIS SO WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THEY WOULDN'T OF HAD THE ABILITY TO TAKE ACTION BUT WITHOUT I'LL JUST SAY I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE HAVE CONSISTENCY FOR THE CONSUMER SO THAT THERE'S A STANDARD.

THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION TASK FORCE ISSUED A REPORT DECLARING THAT THIS PRACTICE. POSES A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISK AND CONTRIBUTES TO ANTI LGBT STIGMA. THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION THEM NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALL OPPOSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INTERRUPTION LET'S NOW GO TO OUR FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR DOUGLAS HALDEMAN I AM THE IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AND PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE DOCTORAL PROGRAM IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. AT JOHN F. KENNEDY UNIVERSITY IN PLEASANT HILL THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO BASIS FOR ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION FOR FOUR MAIN REASONS. FIRST THAT SAME SEX ATTRACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ARE NOT A FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS REQUIRING TREATMENT. SECONDLY THAT SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY IS NOT REALLY A LEGITIMATE FORM OF THERAPY GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SUPPORTING IT. THREE THAT THESE METHODS POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FERRIC UNIQUELY LEGITIMATE METHODS FOR ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE QUESTIONING THEIR SEARCH SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO CONVERSION THERAPY. FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I HAVE CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND WRITTEN POLICY IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS HAVING MAINTAINED A CLINICAL PRACTICE. THAT INCLUDED HUNDREDS OF BOYS AND MEN WHO HAD GOT UNDERGONE SOME FORM OF SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY INCLUDING AVERSIVE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS GENERAL ELECTRIC SHOCK AND NAUSEA INDUCING DRUGS. VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL METHODS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENTS INVOLVING FORCED ISOLATION FROM FAMILIES HUMILIATION AND SO FORTH. NONE OF THESE METHODS WERE AFFECTED IT CHANGING ONE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IN FACT USUALLY EXACERBATED THE PERSON'S ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL GUILT AND SELF LOATHING. IT'S DIFFICULT TO DOCUMENT ALL OF THE HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE METHODS THAT I HAVE OBSERVED OVER THE YEARS IN SHORT TIME. BUT ONE PATIENT STANDS OUT. WHO WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH GUILT FOR HIS INABILITY TO CHANGE AS WELL AS THE GRIEF THAT CAME FROM HAVING BEEN OSTRACIZED BY HIS FAMILY AND COMMUNITY? THAT HE STRUGGLED WITH CHRONIC DEPRESSION SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION FOR YEARS. WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE HAD TRIED SO HARD TO CHANGE TWO YEARS HE REPLIED QUOTE. IN MY WORLD I FELT IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO STAY ALIVE. ALTHOUGH WHAT I'M LIVING NOW DOESN'T FEEL LIKE MUCH OF A LIFE. EFFORTS TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION DON'T WORK AND THEY POSE SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO VULNERABLE PERSONS ACCORDINGLY CPA BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE. IN FACT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THESE PRACTICES AS CONSUMER FRAUD. PLACING SUCH ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT SERVES TO PUT THE PURVEYORS OF CONVERSION THERAPIES ON NOTICE. THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER GET AWAY WITH MARKETING THESE DANGEROUS PRACTICES. BUT IT SERVES ANOTHER EQUALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION SENDING A MESSAGE TO LGBT AND QUESTIONING PERSONS OF ALL AGES. BUT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. IT IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONCE AND FOR ALL TO PUT AN END TO THESE DECEPTIVE AND DANGEROUS PRACTICES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIR INTO THE HONOR WILL MEMBERS OF THIS ASSEMBLY. I SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO SHARE A PART OF MY STORY WITH YOU MY NAME IS MICHAEL FERGUSON AND I'M A SURVIVOR OF THE SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY PRACTICES. BUT WE PERSONAL INTRODUCTION PLEASE LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I'M A LIFELONG STUDENT OF THE SCIENCES. I RECEIVED MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN BIOCHEMISTRY MY PHD IN BIOENGINEERING SPECIALIZING IN FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING. UPON COMPLETION Y. PHD I DID MY FIRST POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. AND I'M CURRENTLY DOING A SECOND POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN COGNITIVE NEUROLOGY AT A TEACHING HOSPITAL FOR HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL. I SHARE ALL OF THIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMPHASIZING THAT I'VE BEEN LIFELONG COMMITTED TO THE SCIENCES AND TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AS IT'S APPLIED TO HUMAN NATURE. YET IN SPITE OF MY SCIENTIFIC LIFE RESUME I AM SORRY I'M FRANKLY EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I WAS SUCKED IN AND DO. BY THE CHARLATANS OF CONVERSION THERAPY. AS A YOUNG MAN I GREW UP WITH THE CLOSE FAMILY CONNECTION TO MY PARENTS AND MY SIBLINGS. HOWEVER CONVERSION THERAPISTS SHATTERED THESE RELATIONSHIPS. CONVERSION THERAPIST TOLD ME THAT MY PARENTS WERE AT FAULT FOR MY HOMOSEXUAL NATURE THIS IN MY FATHER FAILED ME BY BEING TOO DISTANT MY MOTHER FAMILY BY BEING TOO CLOSE. AT A TIME MY LIFE WHEN I NEEDED MORE THAN EVER TO RUN TOWARD. AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT MY FAMILY COULD HAVE PROVIDED TO ME. I WAS INSTEAD ADMINISTERED EMOTIONAL POISON. AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FEEL OUTRAGE HOSTILITY AND ANGER TOWARD MY FAMILY MEMBERS FOR SUPPOSEDLY MAKING ME GAY. BECAUSE OF THE LIES OF CONVERSION THERAPY. I BECAME FILLED WITH BITTERNESS TOWARD MY PARENTS MY FAMILY OF BITTERNESS AT A STRANGE TO US. BUT MULTIPLIED OUR SORROWS AND THE PUSHED ME FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THE DARK NIGHT OF PATHOLOGICAL LONELINESS EMOTIONAL ISOLATION AND YES. SELF HATRED. I AM TRULY BLESSED. BUT AFTER NEARLY A DECADE I WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL THE CONVERSION THERAPY CREATES AND TO REBUILD MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY FAMILY. TOO MANY ARE NOT AS LUCKY. CONVERSION THERAPIST SYSTEMATICALLY PRAY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AND THE SELF LOATHING THE EXACT MONETARY PROFITS FROM THEM AND THEY LEAD THEM FURTHER AWAY FROM THE AUTHENTIC HELP AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. SOME OF ITS MISGUIDED ADVOCATES WE'LL TELL YOU THE CONVERSION THERAPY AS A MATTER OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF. WELL. IF CONVERSION THERAPIES ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELIEF THEN WHY IS THERE A LUCRATIVE INDUSTRY PROFITING OFF OF IT. ANYONE MAKING MONEY AND PROFITEERING UNDER THE BANNER OF RELIGIOUS FAITH. BLASPHEME THE RELIGIOUS FAITH. I WISH THAT I HAD KNOWN HOW DANGEROUS AN OUTRIGHT FRAUDULENT CONVERSION THERAPY WAS BEFORE I STARTED ON THAT PATH. I AM PLOY YOU. PLEASE PROTECT MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY LIKE ME. FROM BEING DEFRAUDED AND PROFOUNDLY HARMED BY THE PSEUDO SCIENCE AND THE JUNK THERAPY. SO CALLED CONVERSION METHODS BY PASSING THIS BILL AND MAKING A CLEAR STATEMENT. SALE OF CONVERSION THERAPY WHATEVER YOU MAY CALL IT. IS FRAUD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. AND YES IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND ALSO THE ORGANIZATION AND THAT YOU'RE AFFILIATED WITH AS WELL AS YOUR POSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOE MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE TREVOR PROJECT TO ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE THEIR SUPPORT TIME THROUGH ME SO I. WE ARE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL BECAUSE. THE PRACTICE IS YOU HEARD ABOUT TODAY OUR TREMENDOUSLY DANGEROUS AND DAMAGING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LGBTQ CONVERSION THERAPY AS IT IS OFTEN CALLED DOES NOT WORK. AND IT DAMAGES PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPOSED TO IT AYE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA STATUTE BE CLEAR ON THIS ISSUE SO WE URGE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SEEING NONE LET'S GO TO OPPOSITION. FOR. DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CHAIR ON. IF NOT MAYBE THREE OF YOU CAN SET UP HERE FOR NOW AND. OKAY WE. THAT WORKS WELCOME THANK YOU OFFER BEING HERE CELL S. LA. WARNING YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. SO WITH THE FIRST WITNESS. I LAYS IN GERMAN IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE I'M DOCTOR JOSEPH NICOLOSI JUNIOR LICENSE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AM I RECEIVE MY PHD FROM THE CHICAGO SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY. AND I'M HERE WITH THE NATIONAL TASK FORCE FOR THERAPY EQUALITY. FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS HAVE OFFERED THERAPY TO COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE SEEKING THERAPEUTIC HELP TO FIND ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS OVER SAME SEX ATTRACTION AND GENDER IDENTITY CONFUSION? MY PRACTICE WAS FOUNDED BY MY FATHER WHO HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE FORTY YEAR SPAN OF HIS CAREER. IN OUR WORK THE CLIENT IS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. HE SETS HIS OWN GOALS WHICH THE THERAPIST HELPED HIM ACHIEVE WE USE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS THE SAME METHODS USED BY OTHER CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO TREAT TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ADDICTION. AS THOSE UNDERLYING DYNAMICS OUR RESOLVE THE CLIENT'S UNWANTED SAME SEX FEELINGS OFTEN DIMINISH AS A RESULT. BUT AB TWO NINE FOUR THREE THREATENS THE ABILITY OF MY CLIENTS TO CONTINUE TO SEEK AND OBTAIN THE HELP THEY WANT. THROUGH ITS BAN ON THE VAGUELY DEFINED PRACTICE OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS OR CONVERSION THERAPY. THE BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZE THE WELL RESPECTED AND SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND TREATMENTS THAT MYSELF AND MANY LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. HAVE BEEN OFFERING TO WILLING ADULTS FOR DECADES. THE BILL IS PREMISED ON INACCURATE CLAIMS A MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS OF THE TYPE OF WORK I DO FOR EXAMPLE. THE BILL INCLUDES IN SECTION ONE LETTER BE. THAT THE APA TASK FORCE QUOTE CONCLUDED THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS COMPOSE CRITICAL HEALTH RISKS. BUT THE VERY REPORT FROM WHICH THESE CONCLUSIONS IS DRAWN ACTUALLY STATES THAT THOSE HEALTH. RISK CONCERNS ARE NOT BASED UPON VERIFIABLE EMPIRICAL DATA. AND IN THAT PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE RECORD REPORT IT SAYS IT IS QUOTE ANECDOTAL UNPROVABLE STORIES AND EVEN THE REPORT ITSELF CONCEDES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN QUOTE TENTATIVELY. IN FACT THAT TASK FORCE REPORT DETAILS EXAMPLES OF CLIENTS WHO RECEIVED BENEFITS FROM THE THERAPIES BANNED BY AB TWO NINE FOUR THREE. FURTHER MULTIPLE PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF PUBLICLY COME FORWARD STATING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THERAPY BANDS SAYING THEY VIOLATE PATIENT RIGHTS. YOU'LL FIND THE FULL REFERENCES IN THE THERAPY QUALITY HAND OUT REFERENCE NUMBER THIRTEEN. THIS BILL ARGUABLY COMPELS THE THERAPIST TO VIOLATE THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. BY PROHIBITING A THERAPIST FROM OFFERING CERTAIN SERVICES TEN LGBT INDIVIDUALS THAT HE OFFERS TO HETEROSEXUAL CLIENTS. IN THIS SENSE THE LEGISLATION DEMANDS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION. HOW ABOUT WE LET ADULTS MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THEY WANT TO PURSUE IN THERAPY? STATE HAS NO BUSINESS TELLING SOMEONE THAT THEIR THERAPY GOALS ARE ILLEGAL AND AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRMAN CHAU AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ON AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE. I CURRENTLY LIVE IN OREGON BUT WHEN I WAS A YOUTH. SIXTH GRADE ON I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH. TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND IT WAS DURING THAT TIME I STRUGGLED WITH SAME SEX ATTRACTION AND. EMBRACE HOMOSEXUALITY GOING INTO COLLEGE AT UC SANTA BARBARA. EMBRACE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY OWN SENSE OF WELL BEING DECLINE AS I FOUND PEOPLE TO SUPPORT MY HOMOSEXUAL DESIRE MY HOMOSEXUAL IDENTITY. I FELT LESS STABLE THAN PRIOR. AND THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME TO RESTORED HOPE WHICH IRAN NOW I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RESTORED HOPE NETWORK. WHICH IS A COALITION OF MINISTRIES ALL ACROSS THE U. S.. THIRTEEN OF WHICH ARE HERE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES DEALING WITH UNWANTED. SAME SEX ATTRACTION. THEN I FIND THAT TO BE A SUBSET OF THE OVERALL GLBT COMMUNITY IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THEIR OWN SAME SEX ATTRACTION. AND. SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF WITNESSES THAT SAY YOU MUST EMBRACE THIS THEY FEEL DESPONDENT. AND SUICIDAL. I'VE HAD THREE SUCH INDIVIDUALS RECENTLY COME TO ME SAYING. YOU KNOW YOU GAVE US THE FIRST HOPE IN A LONG TIME. AND IT'S A HOPE THAT I PERSONALLY OF EXPERIENCED BECAUSE OF DEALING WITH MY OWN UNWANTED SAME SEX ATTRACTION. I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BECOME A MOTHER OF THREE SONS YOUR NOTE TWENTY ONE EIGHTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. AND THEY'RE DOING QUITE WELL BUT WHAT A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULD HAVE FORFEITED HAD I PURSUE THE ROUTE I WAS GOING AND. HASN'T STABLE AS I WAS PERHAPS COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WAS VERY TROUBLED BY WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. AND EVERYBODY AROUND ME WAS AFFIRMING IT. IT WAS IN A MATTER OF LACK OF AFFIRMATION. SO AGAIN WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS ALL THESE RESOURCES THAT WERE. SOME OF WHICH WERE AROUND BUT MOST WERE NOT. THESE WOULD BE BANNED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THOSE WHO ACTUALLY ARE TROUBLED BY THEIR UNWANTED SAME SEX ATTRACTION. ALL OF THESE BOOKS SOME REPRESENT THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST COMMUNITY SOME FROM REGULAR. CONSERVATIVE BAPTIST FROM SOME FROM ALL SORTS OF. ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WHO DEALT WITH HOMOSEXUALITY IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY AND FOUND AFFIRMING AND KIND CARE. NOT COERCIVE NOT AVERSION NONE OF THE ABOVE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS. ALL THOSE MATERIALS AND THIS IS A SMALL SUBSET OF MY BOOKS SHELF IN MY OFFICE. WOULD BE BANNED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT A VERY SPECIAL BOOK TO ME. THE BIBLE WHICH DECLARE SUCH WERE SOME OF YOU IN FIRST CORINTHIANS SIX. CHAPTER SIX VERSE ELEVEN. STILL THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BEING PURCHASED IF IT WERE IN RESPONSE TO. I'M DEALING WITH UNWANTED SAME SEX ATTRACTION WHERE CAN I FIND HOPE IF SOMEBODY SUGGESTED ACROSS OFFENSE YOU SHOULD GO BUY A BIBLE AND READ FIRST CORINTHIANS. GUESS WHAT THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS BILL. SO RESPECTFULLY. I FIND THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY TO BE DRACONIAN IN THIS MEASURES IT'S AN OVER REACH IT NO LONGER IT DOESN'T RESPECT THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH HOMOSEXUALITY. AS MUCH AS A DISRESPECT THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO EMBRACE HOMOSEXUAL DESIRE. PEOPLE LIKE ME AND OTHERS ALONG THE LINE SO. ALTHOUGH THE INDIVIDUALS WE HEARD EARLIER. DID NOT IN THE AND WISH TO PURSUE SUCH CARE AS AN ADULT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO NO LONGER DO SO THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR GOAL IF THEY SO WISH. WHAT WERE PROHIBITING IS THE GOAL OF LEAVING HOMOSEXUALITY WITH AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH? THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID PICK UP. I'M A LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPIST ALMOST ALL MY CLIENTS ARE RECEIVING THERAPY FOR UNWANTED SAME SEX ATTRACTIONS BECAUSE BY EMOTIONAL AND OR SEXUAL ABUSE. IN CHILDHOOD AND BEYOND. I AM GREATLY SADDENED TODAY BECAUSE THIS BILL SAYS THAT MY CLIENTS DON'T EXIST. THIS BILL SAYS THAT I DON'T EXIST. THIS BILL SAYS WHAT I DO IS FRAUD AND DOESN'T WORK. AND WORSE THIS BILL AND THE WITNESSES YOU'VE HEARD JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO INTIMATE OR ACTUALLY CLAIMED THAT WE USE ELECTROSHOCK AND SHAMING THERAPIES WHICH IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE. IT'S LUDICROUS AT BEST YOU'LL NOTICE THEY DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY NAMES OF THESE PEOPLE WHO SUPPOSEDLY CREATED THESE HORRORS. I WOULD ASK RESPECTFULLY THE COMMITTEE TO ASK FOR PEOPLE SO WE CAN GET RID OF THOSE LICENSED THERAPIST IF THEY EXIST AND TAKE WHERE THEIR LICENSES OR THROW THEM INTO JAIL FOR DOING SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS. WE DON'T DO THIS JUNK. OFTEN IT REPAIRED IF THERE BE HELPED SAVE. MY LIFE. I'M A HETEROSEXUAL MAN BUT AT FIVE YEARS OLD I WAS PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK WITH NEIGHBORS WHEN I WAS DRAWN INTO A TENT BY A YOUNG MAN WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A PET A FILE. MY SEXUAL ORGANS WERE STIMULATED AND I WAS INVITED TO STIMULATE HIS ORGANS. THESE EXPERIENCES WERE ONLY ONE OF THE ABUSES THAT LED TO HOMOSEXUAL FEELINGS AND AS AN ADULT WHEN I ENTERED INTO PROFESSIONAL THERAPY MY HOMOSEXUAL FEELINGS DISAPPEARED OVER PER PERIOD OF YEARS. AND MY SEXUAL FEELINGS FOR WOMEN GREATLY INCREASED DUE LICENSE PSYCHOTHERAPY. I'M NO LONGER AROUSED BY MEN'S BODIES BECAUSE THERAPY RESOLVE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE FEELINGS WHICH IS THE CASE FOR EVERY SINGLE REAL CLIENT WHO IDENTIFIES WITH THIS THERAPY. THIS IS NOT IN BORN FOR THESE FOLKS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MEN WHO HAVE FACED THE SAME BASIC ISSUES AN EXPERIENCED ACTUAL EMOTIONAL CHANGE NOT JUST BEHAVIORAL CHANGE. EVERY SINGLE CLIENT WHO COMES OUR OFFICE FEELS AND BELIEVE THAT THEIR HOMOSEXUALITY WAS NOT GENETIC. ALSO I'M DEEPLY OFFENDED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M DEEPLY OFFENDED BECAUSE THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. AND THIS COMMITTING THESE WITNESSES HAVE NEVER CONTACTED REAL REPAIRED OF THERAPISTS OR THEIR CLIENTS TO ASK THEM HOW THERAPEUTIC CHANGE WORKS AND TO AT LEAST KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO MAKE ILLEGAL. WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE THAT? WITHOUT QUESTION IF OUR CLIENTS WHO REPORT CHANGE IN SEXUAL FEELINGS. REPORT DISSIPATION OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY. REPORT FEELING WONDERFUL BECAUSE THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES HAVE ARISEN THROUGH THERAPY THEY WILL NO DOUBT EXPERIENCE MORE DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SUICIDAL IDEATION WHICH IS OF COURSE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU HEARD THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES SAY. THE CRIME HERE AS THAT THE INTOLERANCE PRESENTED HERE BY TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS FOR THERAPY WILL DESTROY THEIR LIVES. EVERYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION RESPECTS VERY MUCH SPECS LGBT PERSONS FOR HAVING THE RIGHT TO BELIEVE IN LIVE AUTHENTICALLY. THIS BILL ROBS ALL THE REST OF US. THE SAME RESPECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A A JUST A REMINDER THAT WE'RE AT THE TEN MINUTE MARK RIGHT NOW SO IF I COULD ASK THE LAST ONE IS TO MAKE IT BRIEF ONE MINUTE OKAY.

GREG BYRD CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE BIGELOW FROM REDDING CALIFORNIA. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES YES PLEASE COMPORT BY AND CALLIE ALLEN WITH MORAL REVOLUTION AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. ANYMORE INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SEEING AND HEARING NINE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL AS HARD TO. OUR PRESENTERS. FROM ON BOTH SITES OBZIRA FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND BEFORE WE DO THAT. CAN WE HAVE TWO CHAIRS MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE OPPONENTS AS WELL IF YOU CAN HAVE TEACHERS IT MADE AVAILABLE TO. AND YOU CAN HAVE TWO INTO HOW THAT. BUT WITHOUT A THE OTHER ADDITIONAL OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THAT HELP YES MS BAKER. AS SOON AS THEY'RE SITUATED THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF ALL TRY TO BE I MIGHT BE RESPECTFUL OF THE COLLEAGUES TIME. ONE BE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS AND IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE STATUTE ARE UNDER THIS BILL. AND I HAVE BECAUSE I HAVE LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY AT THE DEFINITIONS AND I'M APOLOGIZE THE IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE I MISTER INTRODUCTORY POINT SO YOU NEVER TO COVER THIS IN DETAIL. BUT. IF IT AND IF YOU CAN ANSWER IN THE CONTEXT OF. IF I HAVE A CONSTITUENTS. TO WHAT ON WHATEVER JOURNEY THERE ON IN UNDERSTANDING THEMSELVES BETTER. WHEREVER THEY ARE IN LIFE. IS INTERESTED IN EXPLORING A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE ABOUT EFFORTS TO CHANGE BEHAVIORS. OR JUST WANTS TO REACH OUT TO SOMEONE. THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER BY DEFINITION COVERED BY THIS WHAT OPTIONS DO THEY STILL HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM UNDER THE SPELL. SHOULD IT PASS. SURE I A GIFT SEES ME AGAIN. ANTHONY SAMPSON WITH ARLEN PORTER. I THINK THAT THAT ONE THING THAT NEEDS TO BE SORT OF MADE CLEAR HERE THAT IS. THE LIMITED APPLICABILITY REALLY OF OF THE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL HERE. THAT IT APPLIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT WHICH REQUIRES A TRANSACTION TO OCCUR. I'M FOR SERVICES AND. OF COURSE ADVERTISING OFFERING. TO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL. EXCHANGE FOR DOLLARS. WOULD BE PRECLUDED. UNDER THIS BILL. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IS WHAT THE DEFINITION IS IN THAT DEFINITION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS. IS ONE THAT SEEKS TO CHANGE AN INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION. SO IN YOUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISSUE. AND ONCE DESIRE TO TALK ABOUT IT AS AN APPROPRIATE PRACTICE. ONE'S DESIRE TO TALK ABOUT IT IN A BOOK AND ENDORSE IT IN A BOOK. WOULD NOT FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION. THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD NEED TO SEEK TO CHANGE AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND SO IF THERE. IF THAT INDIVIDUAL YOUR CONSTITUENT THAT YOU MENTIONED MERELY WANTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHAT IT IS. THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE HAD. BUT IT'S THE MOMENT WHERE THEY CROSS THAT THRESHOLD OF SEEKING TO CHANGE AN INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR DOLLARS. ALRIGHT IF THIS IS A FREE SERVICE. IT WOULD NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IT'S LIMITED UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT WHICH AGAIN REQUIRES THAT TRANSACTION TO TAKE PLACE. SO. IF AN INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO DO MORE THAN JUST HAVE INITIAL CONVERSATION BUT WANTS TO TRY. AND PERHAPS THAT ONE OF THE LOCATION SIR. PRACTICES OR. ENTITIES THAT HERE IN OPPOSITION TO DEVELOP SELF DESCRIBED IS CARRYING AND SUPPORTIVE. WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO DO THAT UNDER THE SPELL. WITH. THE IF THEY SOUGHT OUT. SERVICES FOR THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION ISSUE AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED ARE ONE TO COPE WITH THAT. AND TO TO DEAL WITH IT. THAT IS OKAY IN FACT. IT CLICKS UNDER THE BILL. ITSELF EXCLUDE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION EFFORT TO DOES NOT INCLUDE PSYCHOTHERAPIES. THAT INCLUDE COPING SOCIAL SUPPORT IDENTITY IDENTITY EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT. INCLUDING SEXUAL ORIENTATION NEUTRAL INTERVENTIONS. AND SO. THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN BE HAD BETWEEN YOUR CONSTITUENT AND THE THERAPISTS BUT THE MOMENT THE THERAPISTS SEEKS TO CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION. EVEN IF IT'S AT THE REQUEST. OF THE PATIENT. THAT'S WHERE THIS. A BILL WOULD APPLY. AND AGAIN THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE ABLE TO SEEK RESTITUTION MEANING RECOVERY. OF THE A OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THEY SPENT FOR THOSE SERVICES AND SO AND YOUR BELIEF THIS IS NARROW THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED THAT THAT IT'S JUST IF THERE IS ANY. EFFORT TO ENGAGE IN. FULL CHANGE. BUT OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ALREADY IN STATUTE IS ACCEPTED I'M INSIDE ACTUALLY AN AMENDMENT YOUR BILL ISN'T CHANGES IS A CURRENT DEFINITION OF COPING. DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR EXPLORING. AND THAT IS ALL STILL ALLOWED AS A TRANSACTION UNDER YOUR BELT. THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S UNDER AN EXEC YOU I THINK I THINK STATURE OKAY AND AND AND YOU KNOW TO GO EVEN. FURTHER AGAIN A A LOT OF. OF THE OPPOSITION REYES FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES. AND THOSE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES TO RAISE YES OTHER SIGNIFICANT. AND THE THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY BUT I THINK WHEN THEY DO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. THEY WILL FIND THAT WHEN. THE OPPOSITION'S YOU KNOW STOP BOOKS UP FOR EXAMPLE. AGAIN INDIVIDUALS CAN EXPRESS THEIR OPINION. ABOUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY CAN IN DORSET IF THEY SO CHOOSE IN A PUBLISHED BOOK. PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO SELL BOOKS BUT THE MOMENT AGAIN THAT DEFINITION OF SEEKING TO CHANGE AN INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION. TRIGGERS. THEN. THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL AGAIN WOULD APPLY. SO HE SIMPLY SPEAKING ABOUT YOUR POSITION ON THE ISSUE IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. AND THAT'S ONE'S ABILITY TO EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OKAY BECAUSE THAT WAS ANYONE MY QUESTIONS IS. AND IF I HAD A CONSTITUENT WHO WANTED TO JUST. HAVE ACCESS TO. THOSE BOOKS IN ARE ON THE TABLE I'M NOT MAKING YOU I'M LOATH TO MAKE CHOICES FOR PEOPLE. BUT IF THEY WOULD STILL HAVE UNDER YOU YOUR UNDERSTAND IN THE STATUTE THEY WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO. BOOKS ABOUT THIS RIGHT THE LID THE LITERATURE ON SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY CAN STILL EXIST. UNDER THIS BILL PEOPLE CAN PURCHASE. LITERATURE ABOUT CONVERSION THERAPY IT IS THE MOMENT THAT. THAT AND THE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WRITING THE BOOK OR THE INDIVIDUAL THE THERAPIST AGAIN MEETING WITH THE PATIENT. SEEK TO CHANGE THE INDIVIDUAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THAT'S AGAIN WHERE THE THE BILL TRIGGERS. SO. I THINK IT IS A VERY OVERLY BROAD POSITION TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THE LITERATURE ON SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY IS GONNA BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES AS A RESULT. IN IT THERE'S A I I DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH. YOU KNOW THE THERAPY I DO HAVE WITH WITH THE STATUTE IT DIDN'T AS A LAWYER AND THIS PARTICULAR STATUTE AT. THERE ARE SOME THAT ARGUE. WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED UNDER EXISTING LAW BECAUSE THE STATUTE IN CALIFORNIA? PROHIBITS IF. BASICALLY SAYING YOU'RE GONNA ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. THAT YOU CAN'T A IN A IN A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION AS A FOR A BECOMES A FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION. SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THE REASONS AYE I'LL AYE WAS LOOKING INTO THIS WHY THIS IS NECESSARY. TO PUT THIS IN THAT LEGISLATION AS OPPOSED TO THE EXISTING STATUTE WHICH BY THE WAY. WHEN THERE ARE LAWSUITS. IT'S ONE OF THE THREE OR FOUR STATUTES THAT'S ALWAYS CHARGED AT IT YOU ALWAYS AND MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT. AND. SO WE WILL SEE A LOT OF CASES POTENTIALLY. WHY IT'S NECESSARY? TO HAVE THIS PARTICULAR AT M. AMENDMENT TO IT GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARGUE IT ALREADY CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME YOU TRY TO. TO DO SOMETHING AND AND AND MARKET AND SELL SOMETHING IN THE CONSUMER TRANSACTION THAT YOU BELIEVE IS FRAUDULENT. DO YOU ARE OPEN TO. BEING SUED UNDER THE STATUTE RIGHT AND SO FROM THERE WOULD HAVE TO ENSUE EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO. SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY. AND EXPERT TESTIMONY THE QUESTION I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS WHETHER. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHETHER THAT SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY. OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE A DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. BY THE VERY TERMS UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING TODAY. I'M AND YOU SAID THE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION IS SURE. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND WIN OR LOSE IN COURT. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LITIGATION PROCESS. BUT BECAUSE SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY IS NOT CALLED OUT AS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE. IN THE LAW. TODAY THAT DEBATE WOULD HAVE TO BE HAD IN LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS WEARS UNDER THIS ON THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE FRAUDULENT UNDER THE LAW MEASURE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN AND LIKE TO LOOK INTO THIS BUT YOU CAN GET ATTORNEY'S FEES. AND THINK UNDER SEAL ARE A. THAT THEY'RE SITTING UP YOU CAN GET PUNITIVE DAMAGES. RIGHT NOT SHOULDN'T OF UNITIVE AND YOU CAN SEE CONDUCT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THE WAY OF TAILORED THIS. TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO A IN A VERY SAYS SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO CHANGE. AS A BECAUSE I WANT I WANT A CONSTITUENT MIGHT HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT AS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH WHATEVER THEY ARE TRYING TO EXPLORE. WE DON'T WANT THE JUST THE OPPOSITE TO HAPPEN WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T. GO TO SOMEONE WHO IS AT LEAST BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS OR FOR THE PROFESSIONAL. REPUTABLE THERAPISTS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. AND SAID THE IMPORTANCE OF TRYING TO HAVE THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED AS POSSIBLE IS IS KEY. AND I THINK THERE ARE DEFINITIONS ALREADY IN EXISTING LAW THAT HAVE BEEN DECIDED BY. THE SUPREME COURT. OF I BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST IN AFFIRMING THE NIGHT ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE NIGHT CIRCUIT'S DECISION. THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT OPTION TO CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE. SO I I AM COMFORTED BY THAT. ESPECIALLY IS THAT YOU HAVE ADULT CONSTITUENTS TO. SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AS THEY GO THROUGH A JOURNEY I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH BUT I DON'T WANT TO TIE THEIR HANDS. SO MY FINAL QUESTION GOES TO THE RELIGIOUS CONSTRUED THE CONCERNS THAT THIS WILL. SQUELCH RELIGIOUS SPEECH. AND I I WOULD LOVE THAT IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THIS DOESN'T HAVE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE AT SOME POINT BECAUSE HE'S A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. IF ANY OF THE PROPONENTS CAN ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT MY UNDERSTANDING IS SOMEONE CAN STILL GO TO CLERGY. OR A OUR ANYONE WHO DOES NOT CHARGE. TO HAVE HAD THIS THEY CAN STILL HAVE THAT. SO THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO CLERGY THEY CAN STILL GO TO SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT POINT I WOULD BE GRATEFUL. IF THEY IF A CHURCH. AS PART OF THE SERVICES THAT IT PROVIDES TO ITS MEMBERS INCLUDES CONVERSION THERAPY. THEY MAY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE UNDER. THIS LAW. AGAIN IT. BECAUSE THAT TRANSACTION HAVE TO TAKE PLACE. RIGHT THE THAT THE TRANSACTION OF HAVING TO PAY FOR THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE UNDERSTOOD RIGHT AND SO AGAIN IF IT IS FREE CONVERSION THERAPY. IF IT IS PROVIDED TO ITS MEMBERSHIP. AND THEN THAT IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE. UNDER THE LAW IN ORDER FOR THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT APPLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT EXCHANGE. IN. YET AT THAT TRANSACTION AND IN MANY CHURCHES PROVIDE MINISTRY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS SO THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T BE IMPORTANT AS WELL THAT YOU DON'T LIMIT IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST MEMBERS AT YOU BUT YEAH EXACTLY I. AM. YOU KNOW I FINALLY AYE AYE SORT OF THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD NOT WANT A PERSON WHO IS EXPLORING OPTIONS OF THEIR. GENDER IDENTITY TO BE FINE THE ONLY AVENUE THEY CAN GO TO IS ONE THAT IS FAITH BASED. SO FOR MY CONSTITUENT WHO DOES NOT WANT TO GO TO A FAITH BASED. PERSON FOR CONVERSATION AND COUNSELING. ON THIS WHAT DOES THAT PERSON DO IF THIS BILL PASSES I'M JUST LOOKING OUT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS HERE SO. I NEVER OF A MIGHT TO THAT OF THE CHAIR RECOGNITION THAT DOCTOR HOLDEN FORMER PRESIDENT OF THIS AYE KHALFAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION IS ALSO HERE. TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I MIGHT THINK OF SNOW. ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU SAID SOMETHING A A FEW MOMENTS AGO THAT REALLY BELONGS IN THIS CONVERSATION I THINK YOU SAID WORDS TO THE EFFECT OF I AM LOATH TO MAKE CHOICES FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEM. THAT FITS HERE BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE ADDRESSING IS NOT. NECESSARILY AT ALL OF THE THERAPIST WO IS ENTERTAINING CONVERSATION WITH REFLECTIVE INQUIRY FOR ALL THE COMPLEX REASONS SOMEONE WOULD WANT. TO CONSIDER CHANGING THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION BUT RATHER. THIS FOCUSES ON THE ROLL OF THE THERAPIST WHO IS MARKETING SOMETHING THAT OP PRIORI. IS SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO CHANGE YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS AND SO THE ONUS REALLY IS ON THE PRACTITIONER TO TO. DEMONSTRATE THAT SHE OR HE IS ABLE TO FOUGHT FULLY ENGAGE THE PERSON ALL OF THAT THAT WHO CRIES RATHER THAN A KNEE JERK. REFLEXIVE REACTION BECOMES FROM THIS LONG DISCREDITED NOTION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING PATHOLOGICAL OR WRONG ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THAT. ONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION DERIVES FROM EARLY LIFE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES THAT IS SO OLD AND DISCREDITED BY THE PROFESSION I'M SURPRISED IT EVEN COMES. INTO THIS ROOM TODAY BUT THE REALLY THE FOCUS IS ON AND SO IF YOU HAVE A CONSTITUENT. WHO? PRESS HERE SAYING GEE I REALLY CAN'T FIND ANYBODY WHO'S IN THE EAST BAY HERE IS WILLING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS THIS LAW DOES NOT. AFFECT THAT AS LONG AS THE PERSON IS IS NOT MARKETING HER OR HIMSELF AS A PURVEYOR. OF. CHANGING YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THINK YOU I'M. I'VE STATUS VERY VERY CAREFULLY WITH NO PARTICULARLY IDEOLOGY IDEOLOGICAL WINDOW ON HERE. AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE GOING THROUGH A JOURNEY THAT I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED. AND. I BELIEVE THIS IS MUCH MORE NARROWLY TAILORED THAN EVEN THE FIRST TIME I READ IT I THOUGHT THE FIRST TIME I READ. THAT IS ONE OF THE BROADEST OVERBROAD THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN. A PARTICULAR FOR A STATUTE THAT HAS VERY BROAD REMEDIES AND IS USED ALMOST IS LIKE THE KITCHEN SINK THAT YOU THROW IT IN COURT. I BELIEVE IT DOES PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE IN OUR WORLD WHO ARE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR OPTIONS FOR HIM THEY NEED TO SEEK DIFFERENT THERAPY AND CONVERSATIONS WITH. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULLY ANSWERING QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FOR THE BILL. AND IT'S IT'S NOT A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE AND THERE SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS HERE BUT I AM. I APPRECIATE YOUR. FOLK TRYING TO KEEP IT AS FOCUSED AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER OBERNOLTE AND THEN FOLLOWED BY MISTER CALDERON. YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SOMEONE LOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT BECAUSE OF THE RESPECT I HAVE FOR YOU. AND THE CO AUTHORS ON THE BILL I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A MINUTE AND EXPLAIN WHY. SO. TO ME WHEN I READ THROUGH THE BILL THE OPERATIVE PARTS OF THE BILL IS THAT SEEKS TO. ESTABLISH SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY AS WHAT IT CALLS A QUESTIONABLE. PRACTICE OF QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY. AND OUT THERE FOR A FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES. AND WE HAD A SPIRITED DISCUSSION HERE OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY IS OF QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY. BUT TO ME THAT ENTIRE DISCUSSION IS MISPLACED BECAUSE THE OPERATIVE POINT OF THE BILL IN MY OPINION. IS IF A HEALTH RELATED PRACTICE IS OF COURSE QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY SHOULD IT BE AGAINST THE LAW. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT SEXUAL CONVERSION THERAPY. THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH PRINT PRACTICES. THAT ARE PRACTICED BY MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT NINETY PERCENT OF US HERE IN THE ROOM WOULD AGREE ARE OF QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY AND YET WE RESPECT THE RIGHTS. FOR CONSENTING ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN THOSE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED LEVEL OUR SOCIETY BELIEVES IN FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. SO IF WE ARE GOING TO SAY. THAT THIS IS OF QUESTIONABLE SCIENTIFIC ABILITY AND SHOULD BE OUTLAWED WORD WE STOPPED WE CALL THESE PRACTICES. INTO THIS CHAMBER ONE BY ONE AN OUTLAW THEM DECLARE THAT THEIR KIDS AGAINST THE LAW REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THEIR PRACTICE BY MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO ME THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE BILL AND. THAT'S WHY I'M ON BILL TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ARE MISTER CALDERON. YOU MAKE THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND THINK YOU. ARE SOMEONE MEMBER LAW FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO THE COMMITTEE ALSO THANK ALL OF OUR WITNESSES AND SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION FOR YOUR TIME AND. INCOME IT'S TO SPEAK TO US I MEAN JUST TO GO OVER. ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILLS THAT WOULD ONLY BAN ADVERTISING OR ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE THERAPY WHERE THERE IS A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION WITH THE GOAL OF CHANGING A PERSON'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION. IT WOULD NOT IMPACT INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO SEEK COUNSEL FROM FAITH LEADERS OR EVEN THERAPY FROM RELIGIOUS GROUPS SO LONG AS. THE GOAL IS NOT TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THERE IS NO TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THERAPIES THAT PROVIDE ACCEPTANCE SUPPORTER FACILITATE COPING. IDENTITY EXPLORATION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION NEUTRAL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND. DO NOT SEEK TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THERE IS COURT PRECEDENT THAT HAS UPHELD THE CALIFORNIA LAW. BANNING CONVERSION THERAPY FOR MINORS MAKING IT UNLIKELY IN MY OPINION A THAT COURTS WOULD FIND THIS BILL. NOT TO INFRINGE ON FREE SPEECH OR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS I'M I I I THINK YOU KNOW. IS SLIPPERY SLOPE BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF ARGUMENT BECAUSE IT IS SEEN THE BILL THE REALITY IS IS THAT THE MESSAGE TO US IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE NO TOMORROW IF THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS OR OF THIS BILL DOES PASS. AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO MAKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW ARE YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT I THINK FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THIS WAS POTENTIALLY GONNA. GONNA LEAD TO OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CAN THAT THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET OUT WELL I THINK THIS BILL IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFIC PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO. SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND. CONVERSION THERAPY AS A MEANS TO FIX IT WHICH I'M NOT EVEN SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS OR THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE I DON'T SEE THAT THIS BILL WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ME. ARE PROHIBITS ANY INDIVIDUAL FROM SEEKING OUT ANY TYPE OF OF HELP OR OR. TIME TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH THAT WITH A A THERAPIST IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. AND SO I THINK THAT. YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME TO TOO NARROWLY TAILOR THE BILL TO STE TO AFFECT A SPECIFIC. ARE ISSUE I AND AND AND AND THAT'S AN ISSUE LIKE INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS IDEA OF CONVERSION THERAPY I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT. OUR A OUR AND BE. I I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. WHEN I LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL GROUPS THAT ARE IN. OPPOSITION. IT DOES IT DOES SADDEN ME I MEAN I I THINK. THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THE BIBLE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF SOMEHOW THIS BILL'S GOING BRAVE I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS CLAIM. AND. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF CHURCH FIRST I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW. WE ARE ALL CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE WILL GO BROKE IMAGE REGARDLESS OF HOW WE ARE. BORN WHETHER THAT IS WORK DAY STRAIGHT TRANSGENDER BISEXUAL WHATEVER I THINK IT IS ALL PURPOSEFUL. I THINK IT IS ALL MEANT TO BE. THAT THAT WAS ALL BY DESIGN. I AND AND TO SEE SO MANY RELIGIOUS GROUPS. IN OPPOSITION IT. IT DOES MAKE ME SAD BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HURT. ARE BY THESE TYPES OF THERAPIES RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE WE HAVE BETTER ACTORS I MEAN WE HAVE MORE GENTLE ACTORS IN INDIVIDUALS TAKING THE TIME. OUT TO CONDUCT THIS THERAPY IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF IT IN OTHER AREAS I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT SHIRT CONVERSION THERAPY PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY LODGE EVERYTHING CONVERSION THERAPIES. PER AND PRACTICES IN THE SOUTH SO. YA I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE. THE TIME THAT EVERYBODY HAS TAKEN TO TRY TO CRAFT THIS BILL IN A NARROWLY TAILORED WAY. AND. LOOK FOR TO VOTING AYE AND MISTER CHAIR I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER TAINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A FIRST FOR ME THINK THE THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I I DID WANT TO GO BACK TO JUST THE THE ANALYSIS WHERE. WE DID TALK ABOUT. A CONVERSION THERAPY CONVERSION THERAPY WE HAD A NUMBER OF. ORGANIZATIONS THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN PSYCHO PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE AMERICAN. MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE AYE ALL OPPOSED TO PRACTICE OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS. ON THE BASIS THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED AND IS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL. TO A PATIENT'S MENTAL HEALTH. WE ALSO HAVE OUR COURT SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S RECOGNIZE THE PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THERAPY. AS A DECEPTIVE PRACTICE EXIST IN THAT VIOLATE EXISTING CONSUMER FRAUD LOS. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT REALLY ABOUT SCIENCE WE HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS. PIPER THERAPY. ACTUALLY. A COULD BE HARMFUL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MARKET THIS. TYPE OF. ASSISTANCE TWO CONSUMER SO IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR DON'T BELIEVE IT. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT US PROTECTING CONSUMERS WHICH IS MUCH OF WHAT WE WE DO IN THE PRIVACY AND BMP AND MET MANY OF THE COMMITTEES HERE. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE. THAT INFORMATION IS BEING GIVEN TO THOSE OF US THAT ARE CONSTANTLY CONSUMING IN THAT IT'S. THAT'S FAIR ITS OPENNESS TRANSPARENT AND THAT IT REALLY. MEETS A MEASURE OF. CONSUMER EDUCATION. SO ON WITH THESE TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS AND AGAIN ON THESE ARE ALL THE THE PRIMARY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT I THINK WE WOULD LOOK TO. WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS EFFECTIVE SOMETHING IS WORKING SOMETHING IT'S OKAY TO MARKET. TO US AS CONSUMERS OF HEALTH CARE. PRODUCTS I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE BASED ON BASED ON THE COURT'S BASED ON THESE A MAJOR HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE STAND WITH THEM. THAT WE SAY THAT THIS IN THIS KIND OF WORK SHOULDN'T BE MARKETED TO CONSUMERS. SHOULDN'T BE A PUT OUT FOR FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION AND THAT IT SHOULD BE CONCERT NOW. AGAIN I THINK WE'VE COVERED THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WE'VE COVERED THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RIGHTS THERE IS NO INFRINGEMENT ON FREE SPEECH THERE'S NO AYE INFRINGEMENT ON PEOPLE TO SAY BUT THEY BELIEVE. TO EXPRESS THAT VIEW POINT BUT THIS IS ABOUT A CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ADVERTISE. THIS TYPE OF SERVICE AND WE HAVE AGAIN EVERY MAJOR HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION. ALL SAYING THE SAME THING TO US HOUSE A LEGISLATIVE BODY. SO AGAIN I I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR FOR BRING IN THIS A BILL FOR ALL BE HAPPINESS BE HARDER TO THE SECOND THIS BILL AND ALSO PROBABLY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY IS SOMETHING A VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DELIVER THIS MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS ARE ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND FOR EVERYONE CAN TODAY. TO. TESTIFYING BOTH SIDES I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES AND THINKING THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THIS ISN'T. A A KIND A BLUNT INSTRUMENT THIS IS A AS A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED A VERY NEARLY CRAFTED PIECE OF OF LEGISLATION. THAT IS MEANT TO TAKE. RESEARCH DONE BY MEDICAL EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE FIELD AND THE COLLEGE OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. TAKE ALL THAT RESEARCH. AND APPLY IT TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO PASS A ITS EXECUTABLE DECISION I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW CONVERSION THERAPY. IS A SET OF WIDELY DISCREDITED PRACTICES OF THE CRIME TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE A PERSON'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND CHANGE THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION OR LESSEN THEIR SAME SEX SEXUAL ATTRACTION. AND ALL THIS RESEARCH RD HAS IDENTIFIED THAT'S HARMFUL OF FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL THE DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR. FOR BEING HERE TODAY I THINK IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH ARMS REPEATING. THE BILL DOES NOT BAN ANY THERAPIES DATA DO NOT SEEK TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ARE DOES NOT BAN ANY THERAPIES THAT PROVIDE ACCEPTANCE SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENTS. OR THE FACILITATION OF CLIENTS COPING SOCIAL SUPPORT IN IDENTITY EXPLORATION. ALL AND DEVELOPMENT. INCLUDING SEXUAL ORIENTATION NEUTRAL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT OR DRESS UNLAWFUL CONDUCT. WHO UNSAFE SEXUAL PRACTICES? OF FREE THERAPIES ARE NOT COVER ON THIS THIS BILL. AND DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN CLERGY AND THEIR PARISH ARE NOT COVERED. ON SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. REPEAT DOES AND DOT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN ALSO MENTION THAT THE. THIS BILL IS SO NARROWER THAN NOW SP ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH HAS. BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT TO NUMEROUS TIMES AND HAS SURVIVED ALL OF THE LAST BEING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DOT TWICE. AND THE LOWER COURT'S RULING WAS BASED ON ARE THE FACT THAT THE LAW REGULATED CONDUCT AS OPPOSED TO FIRST AMENDMENT RELIGIOUS. FREEDOM OR FREEDOM OF SPEECH SO I AM COMFORTABLE A SUPPORTING THE BILL. ARM BUT I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THIS VERY ON. HA HA ROBUST DISCUSSION. SO ON IT HAS BEEN ROBUST WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU HAVE NOT ASKED A POINT OF ORDER. QUESTIONS ORNAMENTS THE CHERRIES OUT OF LINE ZERO RESPECT THE PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND I THINK TODAY WE'VE HAD WHEN YOU IMAGINE YOUR SON GOING UP TO ORDER ME WHOSE HAIR SEXUALLY ABUSED Y.

THE CONVERSATION. AND THE DIALOGUE. WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THIS NOTION OF CONVERSION THERAPY. VERY TROUBLING. CHILDHOOD OF MINE. WHAT ABOUT THAT SIR SIR? SIR IF I COULD ASK YOU TO. SIR PLEASE PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A CAN BE SEEN AS A POLITICAL ISSUE BUT IF YOU EMPLOYMENT FOR ONE MOMENT. AS I WORKED WITH MANY OF YOU ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS I TRIED TO EXERCISE SO. RESPECT AND LOVE. AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PRESENT THIS BILL. BECAUSE WOMEN. THINKING ABOUT CHILDHOOD. AND THAT. WOULD NOT BE OKAY TO BE YOURSELF. AND YOU HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. I HAVE ALSO HAVE THAT. AND THAT COULD CONVERSION THERAPY HELPED ME. A. AND THE AND. AYE CRIES A MILLENNIA I GREW UP IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH. THERE WAS SO MUCH HATE TOWARDS. MY IDENTITY.

A GOOD HOST A BLOOD DRIVE BUT COULD NOT DONATE BLOOD MYSELF. I CAN LOOK IN THE BOY SCOUTS TO CITY HOLDER IN THE MERIT BADGE BUT CANNOT SERVE MYSELF. IN THE BOY SCOUTS. AND SO WHEN HEARING ABOUT THE. THE PAIN SUFFERING OF. WITH THESE PRACTICES WILL DO TO INDIVIDUALS. I'VE. EVER CALLED A VERY DARK DAY FOR ME. IN WHICH I LIVED. THE SAME SENTIMENT AND FEELING. AND THE AYE. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I STAND BEFORE YOU AS A STRONGER PERSON. BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS AND THE RECOGNITION THAT WE ARE ALSO EQUAL PEOPLE. AND THAT THERE'S A LITTLE NOTION THAT YOU NEED TO CONVERT. PROUD OF YOUR IDENTITY. SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE THAT WE CELEBRATE. YOURSELF. BUT YOU CELEBRATE. YOURSELF. AND. THIS RECOGNITION OF THIS IS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE. HELPS RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR STATE IS DOING. AND PROTECTING OUR CONSUMERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND I ASK FOR YOUR. KIND CONSIDERATION.

HAVE SOME CHALLENGES AND STRUGGLES OF THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR JOURNEY IN LIFE THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION TO DO SO. AFTER IT'S BEEN PREVIOUSLY. STATED. AT AND SO WITH THAT I DIDN'T. WANT TO JUST SHARE THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE TO. ME INTO MANY OTHER.

SIX PROHIBITING THE USE OF THE TERM FREE IN THE SUBJECT LINE IF THERE ARE CONDITIONS THAT APPLY UNLESS THE SUBJECT LINE CLEARLY. INDICATES CONDITIONS APPLY. AND SEVEN AUTHORIZING THE COURTS TO IMPOSE INJUNCTIONS TO STOP UNLAWFUL SPAMMING AND FINALLY ALLOWING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEYS AND PERSONS OR ENTITY WHOSE NAME USER NAME EMAIL ADDRESS OR DOMAIN NAME APPEARS. IN THE FROM NAME OR THE SENDER'S EMAIL ADDRESS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION TO BRING THE ACTION AGAINST THE LAW UNLAWFUL SPAMMING. SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED I MISSED THAT ABOUT THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TERM INTERFERE WITH THE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. A BUSINESS AND IT'S OUR CUSTOMERS UNCOMMITTED SIR. TO ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE AS THE BILL MOVES TO LOOK FORWARD AND. WILLING TO TAKE ANY AMENDMENT BEFORE THE NEXT THE COMMITTEE ON THAT LIMITS THOSE PROVISIONS TO SPECIFICALLY ARE ONLY STE UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL EMAIL SO SO I HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE ON TODAY WITH ME I LIKE TO ARM HAD. ASKING THEIR SELF INTRODUCED THEMSELVES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAN BALSAM I'M A CONSUMER PROTECTION ATTORNEY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. BEFORE BECAME AN ATTORNEY I WOULD HAVE WORKED IN MARKETING HAVE AN MBA FROM UCLA AND I WORKED ON ADVERTISING FOR PROCTER AND GAMBLE FED EX VISA AND EIGHTEEN T.. I LIKE EMAIL MARKETING BUT I DON'T LIKE IS WHEN IS FALSE AND DECEPTIVE SPAMMING. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST ANTI SPAM LAWS IN THE COUNTRY ARE EFFECTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. THERE WAS A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE INTENT AT THAT TIME TO PROHIBIT ALL SPAMMING. BUT DUE TO PARTIAL FEDERAL PREEMPTION CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY REGULATE FALSITY IN DECEPTION. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX IS JUST AN AMENDMENT TO THE EXISTING LAW TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE LOOPHOLES AND PROVIDE CLARIFICATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S NO SOCIAL VALUE IN FALSE AND DECEPTIVE SPAMMING. THIS LAW ANY AMENDMENTS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS CANNOT SUE UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW THERE'S NO STANDING. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WHO RECEIVED THE SPAMS ALSO CANNOT SUE UNDER THE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW AND THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO PROVE UP ACTUAL DAMAGES FROM RECEIVING THESE SPAMS. THE CURRENT STATUTE ALREADY HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR RECIPIENTS AND. ARE ALL THIS DOES IS SEEK TO PROVIDE TWO MAIN POINTS I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH OUR THAT THE STATUTE AND THIS AMENDMENT THE BILL. ONLY PROHIBITS FALSELY DECEPTION AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO UNSOLICITED EMAILS SO IT'S NOT GOING AFFECT COMPANIES ABILITIES TO TALK TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE LAW DOES DO RIGHT NOW. IT DOES ADDRESS SPAMS THAT ARE FORGED WITH HEADERS ARE FORGED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SAY THE NEW YORK TIMES IS STANDING IT WHEN THAT'S NOT TRUE. MAYBE THE CURRENT LAW ADDRESSES FROM NAMES THAT ARE GENERIC THE DON'T REPRESENT WHO IT REALLY IS FROM OR PROVIDE FALSE NAMES. SUBJECT LINES ARE CLEARLY FALL SUBJECT LINES ARE CLEARLY PROHIBITED BUT AS MR CHOW MENTIONED SANDERS THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO BY THE LISTS ON THE DARK WEB WHO FORGED HEADERS TO SEE HIT THE SEND BUTTON. THEY'RE NOT LIABLE UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JACOB PARKER I AM IN A. CALIFORNIA CONSUMER ATTORNEY AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS SPACE. SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH UNLAWFUL EMAIL ADVERTISEMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND. CURRENTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE IN FALSE AND DECEPTIVE EMAIL ADVERTISING AND THEY EXPLOIT THE LOOPHOLES IN THE EXISTING LAW TO CAN YOU THAT PRACTICE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONE OF THE LOOPHOLES IN THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT. SOME OF THESE ADVERTISE SOME OF THESE ADVERTISERS HAVE ARGUED THAT. TRUTH IN ONE PORTION OF AN EMAIL CAN CURE FALSITY IN ANOTHER SO TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE. AN EMAIL COULD BE SENT FROM. ANYONE OF YOU COULD APPEAR TO BE SENT FROM ANY ONE OF YOUR. EMAIL ADDRESSES IT COULD IT COULD IN FACT SAY YOUR NAME YOUR ACTUAL EMAIL ADDRESS. AND ONCE YOU OPEN EMAIL YOU'D FIND THAT IT WAS A AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR. CAR LOAN AND. IF. IN THE BODY OF THE EMAIL. IT SAID THIS IS NOT FROM. YOU THIS IS FROM. I. THIS CAR LOAN ENTITY. THEY'RE ARGUING THAT. THE TRUTH IN THE BODY CAN CURE THE FALSITY IN THE FROM NAME. AND THIS BILL WILL CHANGE THAT AND IT'LL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. ANOTHER LOOPHOLE AS THE BILL DOESN'T A DRAFT OF THE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ADDRESS FALSITY IN THE BODY SO YOU COULD HAVE. OUTRIGHT FALSE ADVERTISING IN THE BODY OF AN EMAIL AND THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT AT ALL. SO THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT AND MAKE FALSITY IN THE BODY. UNLAWFUL JUST AS FALSITY IN THE HEADERS OF AN EMAIL IS UNLAWFUL. ANOTHER. AS A MISTER CHAO SAID INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ADDED. TO ALLOW QUARTS TO STOP BAD ACTORS. PEOPLE USING FAKE FROM NAMES. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM USING. MADE UP FROM NAMES THAT ARE MADE TO SOUND LIKE THEY'RE FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT EXIST. AND. THIS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE. EMBEDDED TAX THAT'S DESIGNED TO DECEIVE SPAM FILTERS ON WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ADDRESSED BY THE CURRENT LAW WOULD THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS. AYE AND LEGITIMATE EMAIL ADVERTISERS. OUR ARE ACTUALLY HARM TO BUY. WEEK CALIFORNIA SPAM I THINK PLEASE WRAP UP SIR THANK YOU OKAY. I JUST GONNA SAY. THE JIMMY EMAIL ADVERTISERS ARE HURT BY WEAK CALIFORNIA SPAM LAWS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO COMPETE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO LIE AND DECEIVE. I ENDED ALSO REDUCES THE PUBLIC TRUST IN EMAIL MARKETING IN GENERAL. AND. LEGITIMATE ADVERTISERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY. BEING SOUGHT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR ODD THIS THIS. BILL IS DESIGNED TO SHORE UP THE LOOPHOLES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE ARE AYE. THE BAD ACTORS. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION CHAIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF STEEP CARLSON FOR THE UPDATE AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION DIEM A AND A COALITION OF COMPANIES. AND ASSOCIATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR FIVE FORTY SIX. AMONG THE FACTS MISSING FROM THIS DISCUSSION IS OR ARE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND USEFULNESS OF EMAIL MARKETING BY A BROAD SEGMENT OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. MANY OF WHOM HAVE RAISED CONCERNS OVER THE BREADTH OF THE BILL INCLUDING INSURERS RETAILERS BANKERS GROCERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS. THAT'S NOT JUST HAPPENSTANCE. WE I THINK WE DISAGREE. WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF. LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW. THAT ARE BEING FILLED BY THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT. VIRTUALLY ALL AND AND I AM NOT A TOTAL EXPERT ON THIS ISSUE BUT OF OF THE. ISSUES COVERED BY THE BILL. ARE ALSO COVERED BY. THE FEDERAL LAW THE CAN SPAM ACT. THE YOU HAVE TO SEE IS A VIGOROUS AND FORCE OF THE LAW. WHICH CAN ALSO BE ENFORCED BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL UNDER EXISTING STATE LAW. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL INADVERTENTLY BUT WE BELIEVE IT WILL. PENALIZE LEGITIMATE MARKETERS AND MARKETING. AND AS WILL BE POINTED OUT LATER. WILL INVITE EXCESSIVE LITIGATION BY ADDING AMONG OTHER THINGS. A PRIVATE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR WHICH NO DAMAGES NEED BE SHALL. A THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT. WE IN THIS LEGISLATURE NECESSARILY FAVOR IN MOST CASES. AS I MENTIONED THE BILL'S DONE NECESSARY AS I KNOW THAT FEDERAL LAW LARGELY PREEMPTS THE FIELD AND THERE IS AMPLE ENFORCEMENT. WHILE WE MAY NOT QUARREL THAT SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE BILL ARE. IN FACT CHAU FALSITY AND DECEPTION. AGAIN. THAT BAY TRIGGER A VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CAN'T SPAM LAW OR THE FEDERAL CAMPS PAM LA BECAUSE THEY SAID THERE. GENERALLY COVERED IN SEVERAL CASES OVER BROAD SUCH AS THE MERE MENTION OF A THIRD PARTIES DOMAIN NAME. WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION AND AN EMAIL. THAT COULD BE AS WELL AS. DE AS INNOCENT AS AND SENDING A NEWSLETTER AND. A DOMAIN NAME OF OF SOME OTHER ORGANIZATION IS IS IS COVERED. SO WE NEVER CHAO. REFERRED TO THE THE ISSUE OF FREE WHICH IS A A A REAL CONCERN TO US AND OTHERS I THINK YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER WITNESSES. RIGHT NOW WOULD IT IS ILLEGAL. TO OFFER FREE PRODUCT OF SERVICE AND NOT HAVE THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS DISCLOSED CLEARLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY. OUR THE FTC GUIDES ENFORCES THIS BAT ASPECT OF THE LAW. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL CREATES CONDITIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE TOOL THAT'S VERY POPULAR WITH CONSUMERS NOT JUST MARKETERS. AS MATCHING MENTIONED ADDING NEW. TRIGGERS FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW. THE THAT ARE ARE LARGELY COVERED BY THE FEDERAL LAW SEEMS UNNECESSARY. WITH THE STATE SHOULD NOT DO IS TO ADD A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. THAT NEEDS NOT CHAU DAMAGES AND POTENTIAL ENFORCEMENT BY FIFTY EIGHT D. A.'S AND FOUR HUNDRED PLUS IT CITY ATTORNEYS. WE CAN'T SPAM LAW WAS WOODS MADE A FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO HAVE A CONSISTENT MEANS OF DEALING WITH THIS UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING HERE IS IS SORT OF THE EXCEPTION IN THE LAW THAT DEALS WITH FALSITY IN DECEPTION. BUT. WE GOT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT ADDING THESE THERE WILL LIKELY BE A FLOOD OF LITIGATION THAT YOU CAN SEE THE. PEOPLE UP TESTIFYING WHERE MEMBERS OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS. AND WILL PENALIZE THE GOOD ACTORS MOREOVER ADDING THESE REMEDIES. WE BELIEVE IS ALSO PREEMPTED BY THE CANCER. CAN'T SPAM LAW AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SARAH BOOT I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL AS OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED. WE PRESENTED A DRAFT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO MISTER CHAO'S OFFICE AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS STAFF WE APPRECIATE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS PUT FORWARD AND WE HOPE. ON THAT WE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSS AND SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME MORE COMMON GROUND. WE SHARE THE AUTHORS CONCERNED ABOUT BAD ACTORS PERPETUATING SPAM EMAIL THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE TRUE ABOUT ACTORS. AND HAS WRITTEN WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENHANCED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL WOULD ENSNARE TOO MANY LEGITIMATE COMPANIES AND LITIGATION AND NOT DO ENOUGH TO GO AFTER THE SHADY. COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE SHADOWS THERE REALLY TEND TO BE THE TRUE BAD ACTORS PERPETUATING THIS BEHAVIOR. SO THE AMENDMENTS WE SEEK WOULD BETTER EMPOWER LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES TO GO AFTER THE TRUE ABOUT ACTORS. AND CURTAIL THIS ADDITIONAL EXPANSIVE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE JUST ASK STATE YOUR NAME AND POSITION. AND OF THE WELSH. DRAW COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WHERE OPPOSE THE MOST AMENDED. MARGARET CLASS STAMP I HAVE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED MUST MANAGE. A MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CHRIS MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER. BE HAVE A COMP TIA. WE ALSO SHARE THE SAME OPPOSE UNLESS I'M IN A POSITION AS OUTLINED BY THE CHAMBER. LARA BUT IT WITH TECHNO OPPOSED WITH AMENDED. CROSSTALK WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION I WOULDN'T CARE LETTER IN TIME BUT WOULD ALSO SHARE THE POST LISTEN AND. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I I THINK THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW. CALIFORNIA STATUTE REGARDING SPAM EMAIL BUT. WHAT YOU PROPOSED IS SOME COMMON SENSE IN MY OPINION? OUR AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW THAT ALREADY EXIST SO. I ACTUALLY AM INCLINED TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I'VE A COUPLE CONCERNS THAT I WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU. ONE OF THEM IS. IN SECTION B. SIX OF THE BILL HOW JUST READ DESCENDS IT SAYS THE EMAIL ADVERTISEMENTS HEADERS SHOW. THAT IT WAS SENT FROM. OR PURPORTEDLY SENT FROM A DOMAIN NAME THAT WAS PROXY REGISTERED FOR FALSELY REGISTERED SO THAT A PERSON SEARCHING A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA BASE. SUCH AS WHO IS CANNOT READILY DETERMINE THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE PARTY WHO INITIATED THE EMAIL. SO CAN CAN YOU JUST TELL US WHY THAT SECTION AS IN THE BILL. AND I TURNED OVER TO MY NGUYEN IS HERE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I'M THAT ARE BE SIX THERE'S ACTUALLY MERELY CODIFYING EXISTING CASE LAW. THERE THERE'S A CASE OUT THERE WHERE THE. COURT OF APPEAL SPECIFICALLY TALKED ABOUT. BUT I REFER TO AS GENERIC FROM NAMES ON FROM CHRISTIAN DATING YOUR BUSINESS. CAR INSURANCE I IN COMBINATION WITH A PROXY REGISTER DOMAIN NAME. I'M. AT THE RISK GETTING VERY TECHNICAL AND PLEASE STOP ME IF THIS IS TOO DETAILED THERE IS A PUBLIC DATABASE WE CAN LOOK UP TO SEE WHO OWNS A DOMAIN NAME. AND SPAMMERS DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY DO WHAT'S CALLED PROXY REGISTRATION. THEY TURN OVER LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THEIR DOMAIN NAME TO A PROXY SERVICE WHICH THEN LICENSES USE OF THE DOMAIN NAME BACK TO THE ACTUAL SPAMMER. THE RESULT IS THAT THE SPAMMER CAN SPAM AWAY BUT A PERSON CLEARING THE DATABASE DOESN'T SEE THE SPAMMER THAT THEY SEE AS THE PROXY SERVICE PONDERS CASE LAW ON POINT. THIS MERELY CODIFIES OKAY WELL THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION BUT MY PROBLEM WITH THIS SECTION IS THIS. IF. SOMEONE SPOOFS THE FROM ADDRESS TO IT WILL BAN THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY SENT FROM. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT IS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE AND SHOULD BE OUTLAWED BUT OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL ALREADY DO THAT. BY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE ABLE TO. LOOK UP THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO OWNS A DOMAIN USING A REGISTRATION SERVICE SUCH AS WHO IS. AND. MY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT MOST COMMERCIAL REGISTRATION SERVICES. BY DEFAULT ALREADY PROXY THOSE ARE REGISTRATION NAMES IF YOU USE REGISTER DOT COM TODAY TO GO REGISTER A NEW DOMAIN NAME BY DEFAULT UNLESS YOU UNCHECK THE BOX WILL BE PROXY THROUGH THEM SO. ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO OWN DOMAINS HELP PRIVACY REASONS WHY THEY DON'T PUBLISH THE THOUGH THERE IF THERE ARE OWNERSHIP LISTINGS OF REMAINS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A FRAUDULENT INTENT SO. I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU MISTER CHAIR AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT WHY THAT PROVISIONS IN HERE. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT THAT IT BELONGS HERE. BUT I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN WITH SECTION BE NINE OF THE BILL CONCERNING THE USE OF THE WORD FREE AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT HERE. BUT I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO. DO SOME SERIOUS. SOUL SEARCHING ABOUT WHAT THE. WELL WHAT THE GOAL IS AND HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE IT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IN A SUBJECT LINE I DON'T THINK IT'S. A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT SOMEONE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER. AND USE EXPLICITLY SAID THE LANGUAGE YOU CAN'T PUT AN ABSTRACT AND EXPLAIN IT ELSEWHERE SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS NOT SAYING THE FREE HAS TO BE EXPLAINED YOU'RE SAYING. THAT FREE IS OUTLAWED. BUT I WHICH I DON'T THINK IS A REASONABLE THING TO DO IN A SUBJECT LINE AND ALSO I THINK YOU ALSO NEED TO CLARIFY. WHAT EXACTLY? THE CONTEXT OF FREE THAT YOU'RE OUT LONG IS BECAUSE IF YOU SAID SOMETHING LIKE SUGAR FREE. OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD NOT MEET THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND YET. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEGAL DEFINITION RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT A TERM THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE USED SO I WOULD ASK IF YOU WOULD. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY WILL DO JUST THAT IN FACT. WELL WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE WORD FREED INTENT OBVIOUSLY IS TO STOP THE USE OF THE WORD FREE IF THE ITEM IS NOT FREE. SO. THE. I THINK A. YOU KNOW EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT WOULD. BUT YOU KNOW BASICALLY BE OKAY WOULD BE FREE IF I IF WE KNEW ALL FREE IF YOU DO ACTS IN ON THE SUBJECT LINE I THINK THOSE WOULD BE ALLOWABLE ACCEPTABLE UNDER THE LAW. AND BUT WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK TAKE A LOOK AT IT AS WELL ARE WE WERE GONNA AT THE WORD UNSOLICITED IN FRONT OF THE WORD FREE OR IN. TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT WILL TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THE UP DISSECTION THAT'S A. SECTION SIX AS YOU MENTIONED ARE MORE CLOSELY AS WE GO BUT I DO WANT ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND. AND ALL ONE AT A TIME AND A WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF PREEMPTION. OF FEDERAL LAWS PRETTY CLEAR IN FACT A FEDERAL LAW SAYS THAT THERE IS A% THERE'S A PREAMP THERE DURING SPRING I'M XIN OF STATE LAW EXCEPT. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH STATUTE REGULATION OR RULE PROHIBITS FALSE THE OR DECEPTION IN ANY PORTION OF THE COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC EMAIL. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX IS OPERATING UNDER IN FACT THAT'S TOTALLY CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW AND NOT SO. YOU KNOW THE THE THE CODE SECTION THAT I CITED EARLIER AW IS IN FACT A WITHIN THE CONFINES OF DOT TO EXCEPTION. NOW WITH RESPECT ALSO WE HOW THE SEVERABILITY CLAUSE IN THERE ARE THAT'S BILLION SO IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS ANY QUESTIONS ARE WE COULD. A TAKE OUT ANY PROVISIONS THAT MAY BE DEEMED A PREEMPTIVE. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF DUPLICATION. OB THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY ARE CURRENTLY. YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO STANDING TO BRING AN ACTION ARE ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD DO THAT. AND. AND IN FACT DID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NOT BROUGHT FORTH A LOT OF CASES OVER THE YEARS AND THE FTC HAS ALSO BEEN MISSION. ONLY BRINGS A HANDFUL OF CASES EVERY YEAR SO THIS LAW WILL GIVE THE INDIVIDUAL OR THAT THE VICTIM OF THE YOU KNOW STANDING TO BRING A LAWSUIT. TO RECOVER DAMAGES NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT IS ALREADY EXISTING LAW I MEAN WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO. TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE NOW TO THE POINT BEING. AT SEA. THERE WAS A FOURTH POINT OF THE OUR. IMPACT ON THE. OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS FOCUSING ON THE UNSOLICITED EMAILS NOT NOT SO MUCH THE SOLICITED ONES. ARE NOW IN FACT I THINK GO BACK A TWO YEARS AGO THE IT. SIDE THEY DID A STUDY I THINK OF ALL THE EMAIL TRAFFIC SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TRAFFIC CONSTITUTE A SPAM EMAIL. SO THAT GOES TO SPEAK TO THE OUR. PROBLEM THAT WE STILL HAVE ON OUR HANDS. AND. I THINK. DOES BUT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE IN THE MONTHS TO COME SO. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE POINT ABOUT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE. OF THE I REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION AND IF THAT HAD BEEN SOMETHING NEW. THAT YOU WERE ADDED I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY A PART OF STATE LAW TO ME THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING BUT. I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING AT THOSE TWO ISSUES PARTICULARLY THE USE OF THE WORD FREE IN THE SUBJECT LINE. ABSOLUTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER BERMAN. THE MISTER CARE AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRING THE BILL. DON'T WANT TO BELABOR A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE I THINK A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT. MISTER WANT OBERNOLTE MADE. WERE VERY VALID I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK THAT A LOT SOME THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. ARE VALID. AND SO. WHILE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY IF THIS WERE THE VERSION ON THE FLOOR I PROBABLY WOULDN'T. AND SO REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH. IN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO HEAR THEM OUT AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO TO ALLEVIATE. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED WILL DO JUST THAT AND WILL REACH OUT YOUR OFFICE AS WELL PERFECT THAT THANK YOU* THANK YOU. ONE CLARIFICATION SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER THIS BILL CREATES A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING MR CHOW THAT IT. THAT IT DOES. NO IT DOES NOT THAT'S IN EXISTING LAW. MINE DOES MY UNDERSTANDING AND THE OPPOSITION DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT OR NOT. I MEAN I THINK THAT IT IN MY VIEW OF AS WE LOOK AT IT. RIGHT NOW THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED THROUGH EXISTING STATE LAW SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS. FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHAT? I THINK THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ON HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR WHICH NO DAMAGES NEED. PROVEN. UNDER SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED YOU HAVE TO SHOW DAMAGE. SO THAT THE WELL I'M WRESTLING WITH THAT NIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A CONCERN THAT THAT SEE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ADDS STATUTORY DAMAGES TO AN EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHERE THOSE DAMAGES ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE. AND YOU KNOW THAT MR TRUMP WE ARE GIVING STANDING TO INDIVIDUALS ON THE LAW AND THE CURRENT LAW WOULD NOT ADDING ANY PRIOR WRITER ACTION TO. TO THE BILL I MEAN YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN NOTICING THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOR RIGHT NOW PRIDE RIGHT I THINK HIS POINT IS THAT THIS ABOUT CREATES A NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES AYE EE. DAMAGES THAT PROOF OF HARM EITHER NOT AVAILABLE UNDER THE EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I. I CAN LOOK INTO SOME MORE BUT I I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE BUT THAT THAT SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED IS A. IS. WHAT GIVES? DID YOU HAVE THE PROGRAM AGES. RIGHT PASSED SO DOES THAT RESOLVE YOUR CONCERNS OF THAT WERE. OUR CONCERN IS WHAT WE'VE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF A CALIFORNIA CANSPAM ACT FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT MAKE BY ADDING THAT A LOT OF WORK TRIGGERS RIGHT WHICH. AGAIN WE BELIEVE IT IS ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW MOVIE THINK THOSE THINGS ARE COVERED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. MY CONCERN IS THAT RIGHT NOW. IT CAN ONLY BE ENFORCED UNDER. UNDER. AND UNDER THE CAN SPAM ACT BY THE AG EMAIL PROVIDER AND A RECIPIENT OF THE EMAIL THIS EXPANDS THE UNIVERSE OF THOSE WHO CAN BRING ACTIONS. NOW I THINK THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BRING ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES STATUTES SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED WHICH REQUIRES A SHOWING OF DAMAGES MIGHT. CONCERN HERE IS THAT THIS NEW THIS. LANGUAGE HERE ALLOWS AN ACTION TO BE BROUGHT WITHOUT. HIM THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M WRESTLING WITH THE LIGHT. IF I COULD ASK MY WHEN IT'S TAKEN REFUSER US I TWENTY BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT EXISTING LAW ALREADY HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES IT'S ALREADY THERE. WHAT THIS AMENDMENT DOES IT DOES NOT ADD STANDING IT DOES NOT ADD STATUTORY DAMAGES THE ONLY THING IT DOES IS PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES AND CLARIFICATIONS OF WHAT WOULD VIOLATE THE STATUTE? ARM AND IT HOLDS THE SENDER'S LIABLE FOR ACTUALLY HITTING THE SEND BUTTON WITH THESE FALSE DIDN'T DECEPTIVE CLAIMS. THERE'S SIMPLY NO ADDITIONAL STANDING. BEING PUT INTO PLACE BY THE SPELL. I I I UNDERSTAND THAT POINT I DO. THINK IT'S. PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE BILL WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF POTENTIAL LITIGATION. ALLEGATION. HAVING NO CONSUMER ATTORNEYS USUALLY DON'T SHOPPERS FOR THINGS THE RESULT IN LESS LITIGATION AND. YOU KNOW EVEN IF THIS DOES NOT CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OR EVEN IF IT DOESN'T CREATE A NEW TYPE OF DAMAGES IT DOES. WHY DID THE AMBIT OF THE EXISTING CAUSE OF ACTION? AND THAT SO MISTER I CHAO FROM A YOU KNOW. ONE SHARE TO ANOTHER I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN FOR OUR OUR OUR IN BOXES. ALTHOUGH MY G. MALES SPAM FILTER SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL. BUT I I YOU KNOW AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF NICE LITTLE HOOKS ALREADY IN THE LAW FOR AND YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS TO GO OUT THERE AND MAKE MONEY OFF OF SPAM I'VE SEEN AT THERE'S A COTTAGE INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP AROUND IT. AYE THEY GO OUT THERE AND SEARCH FOR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO A POTENTIAL VIOLATION AND THEY SAY WITHOUT ANY NEED TO REALLY PROVE THERE'S BEEN. THIS PERSON A SUFFRAGAN ANYWAY AND I REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HAVE SOME. CRISIS OF OF PEOPLE BEING DEFRAUDED BY BY SPAM GOING ON IN THE STATE SO WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PROOF OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS I'M PRETTY WARY. TO OPEN UP EVEN MORE AVENUES FOR OUR WHAT IS OFTEN QUITE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION SO I DO APPRECIATE. THE INTENT OF THE BILL UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND A NO VOTE AND. IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL SINCE. JUST INCLUDING AYE AYE IT MAYBE JUST TO HAVE. I JOIN A SURE THE NUMBERS WITH YOU BEFORE I BEFORE I CLOSE AND. IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S THE ESTIMATED THAT. O. SPAM EMAIL THAT WOULD CAUSE CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS WELL OVER A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE NEXT THERE A YEAR OR SO SO SO THAT'S THE BASED ON THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE. ON FILE SO THAT THERE IS A ECONOMIC GO COMPONENT TO IT TO THIS. AS WELL SO WE GOT AYE I RESPECTFULLY ASK BRAG. I THIS IS A MOTION. AND A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CHAO. CHAU I KILEY KILEY NO BAKER. BERMAN A BERMAN AYE CALDERON CALDERON AYE IRWIN MULLIN OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE AYE RESTS TING. TING AYE. THE BILL IS ON CALL I DON'T REALLY SEE THE. RIGHT. NOT A PROBLEM. DOT. OKAY WELL THAT'S. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT ARE DEBORAH THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AND THAT'S AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY NINE. AND DOWN BEFORE BEFORE ON THE AUTHOR PRESENTS I'D LIKE TO CONFIRM THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY NINE. OFFERED HEARING TODAY THIS MARCO WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS I BELIEVE. ABOUT THE MARKET A COPY OF THE MARKET IS BEING CIRCULATED. I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERY MEMBER HOUSE THE COPY. ONCE THAT OCCURS IN WILL BE KIAN. YES PLEASE UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I YES WE ARE AGREEING TO THE AMENDMENTS IN THE MOCK UP. THAT'S BEFORE YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND ALSO THE MEMBERS WHO. KNOW SEVERAL EXPRESSED INTEREST IN AND HAD SOME INPUT. I THINK WE'VE INCLUDED THAT IN THIS MOCK UP. S. SO I APPRECIATE THE THE DISCUSSION THAT MY BILL HAS. GENERATE EVEN BEFORE WE GOT TO THIS HEARING TODAY. SO. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR FOR THEIR HELP IN THEIR INPUT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT NOT SOMETHING THAT AS THIS BILL. HOPEFULLY IF IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT PROCESS AND WORKING FORWARD SO. CALIFORNIA THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO FREE SPEECH. WITH THAT IN MIND I BELIEVE THE STATE SHOULD URGE A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES A. WHERE THESE PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME VERY LARGE VERY INFLUENTIAL? AND WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVITED ON TO EXPRESS ALL SORTS OF VIEWS. THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S THE FREE SPEECH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS PROTECTED. UNDER MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS OR AFFILIATIONS AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY NINE WOULD PROHIBIT ANY PERSON WHO OPERATES A SOCIAL MEDIA. INTERNET WEBSITE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA FROM REMOVING OR MANIPULATING CONTENT ON THE BASIS OF THE POLITICAL AFFILIATION OR POLITICAL VIEWPOINT. OF THE CONTACT OF THE CONTENT EXCEPT AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE. MOCKUP EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNET WEBSITES TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE. ABOUT THE BILL ALSO DEFINED SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE PURPOSES. AS ANY ELECTRONIC SERVICE YOUR ACCOUNT HELD OPEN. TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. A POST AND EITHER A PUBLIC OR SEMI PUBLIC PAGE DEDICATED TO A PARTICULAR USER ELECTRONIC CONTENT OR COMMUNICATION. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO VIDEOS THAT STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OR MESSAGES INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE SHARING OF INFORMATION. IDEAS PERSONAL MESSAGES OR OTHER CONTENT. THIS DEFICIT THIS DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PUBLIC OR SEMI PUBLIC PAGE OF A PERSON AN INDIVIDUAL. WERE ANY POSTED ELECTRONIC CONTENT OR COMMUNICATION MAY REASONABLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THAT PERSON. THAT TO WHOM THAT PAGE BELONGS OR IS ASSIGNED. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT STORIES COMING UP WHERE THERE'S AT LEAST BEEN ALLEGATION OF. VIEW POINTS BEING SUPPRESSED OR REMOVED. FROM. SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES BASED ON THE VIEWPOINT OF THE PERSON POSTING THAT THING SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET THAT. WITH. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY NINE CERTAINLY WE WILL THIS WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. TO NEO ONLY ALLOW THEIR VIEW POINTS TO BE EXPRESSED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE GROUPS ARE BEING FORMED FOR. BUT THE PLATFORM ITSELF. HAS ESSENTIALLY INVITED THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO COME ON IS BECOME A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM AS AS THAT. CONCEPT HAS BEEN DEFINED BY CASE LAW. AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN THAT LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM VIEWPOINTS ARE PROTECTED. I COULD GET INTO SOME OF THAT CASE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OF. THE. MAYBE SAVE THAT FOR A QUESTION IF SOMEBODY HAS A BETTER. I WOULD AYE BUGGIN AYE I WELCOME THE INPUT ON THIS I YOU KNOW I I KNOW THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN I THINK SOME VERY HELPFUL AMENDMENTS I THINK HELP US. THAT I GET THIS BILL TO THE RIGHT SPOT TO THAT SWEET SPOT. WERE WERE NOT NEO INFRINGING ON A PRIVATE BUSINESSES. RIGHTS. BUT ALSO ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF. PRIVATE FTA SPEECH RIGHTS. IN MEDIUMS THAT. PREVIOUSLY WOULD IN NO RIGHT TO ME NOW. YOU KNOW HOLD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SOMETIMES HINGE ON. FACEBOOK RIGHT. YEAH TERMS OF THINGS YOU KNOW TARGETING VOTERS AND DOING THINGS LIKE THAT IN A WORLD WHERE. INCREASINGLY OUR IDEAS ARE EXPRESSED IN THIS MEDIUM. HOW DO WE ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLES? SPEECH RIGHTS A THE IN THE MARKETPLACE. OF IDEA SO THAT'S OR TRYING TO GET AT I WOULD I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT ALREADY AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THAT TODAY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THINKS THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY HAVE SELLING ITEMS KEVIN MCKINLEY AND THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR AFFAIRS FOR THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FORTY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INTERNET COMPANIES. THE INTERNET HAS BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY BECAUSE THE FACT OF ITS FREE AND OPEN AND ACCEPTING OF ALL VIEWPOINTS FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN PEOPLE FOR EVERY POLITICAL WALK OF LIFE CONFINED COMMUNITY. TO SHARE CONTENT THAT INTEREST THEM. AND INTERNET PLATFORMS ENABLE EVERYONE TO LEARN SHARE AND DEBATE THE DIVERSITY OF VIEWS. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR SENTIMENT OF ENSURING THAT THESE PLATFORMS REMAIN OPEN TO EVERYONE. AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS ITS IMPRINT THE NEW MARK UP THAT YOU SEE TODAY. CIRCULATED THIS MORNING AND WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO FULLY VET. EVERY PIECE OF THAT MARKUP. AND THE NEW FOCUS IS MORE ON THE TERMS OF SERVICE OF WHAT THE SENATE PLATFORMS DO. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THE COMPANIES CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR VIOLATING THEIR TERMS OF SERVICE. WHICH IS ALSO WITH THIS VERSION PROPOSES TO DO SO THAT'S ALREADY CURRENT LAW. IN FURTHER. THIS APPROACH OF FOCUSING ON TERMS OF SERVICE MAY FORCE. THESE. POLICIES TO BE LONGER AND WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THAT WILL REALLY RESULT MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS. SO WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO BE OPEN WORK ON THE LANGUAGE GOING FORWARD. BUT WE REMAIN OPPOSED APPROACH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING. GOD. BRIEFLY UP CEREBRAL WOULD AYE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OUR INTENTION WAS TO IMPOSE OPPOSE THIS BILL AS IT IS IN PRINT TODAY HOWEVER. WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF MISTER GALLAGHER TO DO SUCH SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS. I WILL BE REVIEWING THEM WITH OUR MEMBERS WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS WERE AS WHETHER THEY WILL WORK FOR THEM OR NOT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. QUESTION OF MISTER QADER. THANK YOU. JAMES I. APPRECIATE YOU WAITING IN THIS CONVERSATION IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I WHAT I WILL SAY THAT THIS BILL RAISES. THIS NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. WE NEED A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ROLE WEBSITES A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SHOULD PLAY IN MAINTAINING PUBLIC FORMS. OF WHAT RESPONSIBILITY DO THEY HAVE FOR FALSE OR MISLEADING CONTENT WHAT RESPONSIBILITY DO THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE SPACE FOR THOUGHTFUL FACT BASED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POLITICS AND POLICY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR CONTENT THAT DISTRACTS FROM? THAT DISCUSSION OR IS FALSE OBSCENE OR IS BASED ON HATRED. THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. WHICH I DO HOPE THAT THIS BILL. LEADS TO PASS SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT WHEN IT COMES THAT CONVERSATION IS THIS BILL ADVANCING THAT CONVERSATION AND SO I WHILE I PREVIOUS. APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT REMOVE SEARCH ENGINES. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IT'S SIMILARLY ON WORKABLE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND SO MY FEAR IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ACTUALLY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE OBSCENE HATEFUL OR VIOLENT OR. A VIOLENT OR OTHER CONTENT THAT VIOLATES PLATFORMS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT THIS MEASURE COULD FORCE PLATFORMS TO MAINTAIN CONTENT THAT THEY DISAGREE WITH. WHICH WOULD SEEM TO ME AT GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF SPEECH AND SO I THINK THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE FREEDOM. YOU KNOW THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE WHAT WE LIKE THERE'S ALSO A FREE SPEECH SSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE COMPANIES IN THESE PLATFORMS BEING ABLE TO. ARE NOT. LET THEIR PLATFORM PROMOTE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T JUST THAT THAT THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. IN THAT I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT WHEN ITCOMES TO BULLYING THREATS. HATE SPEECH. WHAT I DON'T ONE IS I I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE IN THIS ROOM YOU INCLUDED THAT? WE DON'T WANT OUR TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD THESE PLATFORMS COULD BE SUED. BOB BECAUSE THEY REMOVED CONTENT THAT WAS A SPECIFICALLY MEANT TO BE A SOME TYPE OF HATE SPEECH WILL MORE THREATENING OR WAS. WAS A BULLYING. INCIDENT I AND SO THAT IS A MAJOR CONCERN THAT I HAVE. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS. YOU KNOW THE WHAT ABOUT ALL THE POSITIVE STUFF ON TRUMP OUT THERE JUST KEEPS GETTING VERY BLACK TIGHTS NOT THERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST BUT. I WILL SAY THAT. YOU SAY SO THAT. THAT. BUT BUT IF YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT IDEA OR THAT QUESTION OF POLITICAL. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT POLITICAL RELEVANCE THAT POLITICAL SPEECH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW WHO IS IS ENGAGING IN HATE SPEECH OR OR RHETORIC THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE. YOU KNOW WHERE THIS PLATFORM MAY THINK OKAY THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOVED BECAUSE THERE CAN BE HARM A NOW THEY'RE. THEY'RE LIABLE WILL THERE'D LARA LIABLE FOR LITIGATION BECAUSE I THINK IT COULD BE ARGUED WHILE I'M EXERCISING MY FREE. MY RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH IN THIS IS POLITICAL SPEAK FOR ME BECAUSE THIS WAS POLITICALLY WHAT I BELIEVE IN AND WHAT I THINK. AND SO I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE. I MEAN. I THINK OF WAGING A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HERE MY ONLY CONCERN IS. THAT BULLYING IN THE THREATS ASPECT I DON'T WANT TO OPEN THAT UP TO LITIGATION WHERE WE CAN'T REMOVE THAT. THAT CONTENT OR YOU KNOW OR DEAD PLATFORM IF IT JUST IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THAT AND THEY BELIEVE IT INFRINGES ON THEIR FOR THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. WANT TO REMOVE THAT FOR SAFETY REASONS OR WHATEVER OTHER REASONS. THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT I'LL HAVE TO LOOK IN TO SEE YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT THE EXCLUSION OF THE. THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE TERMS AND SERVICES AGREEMENT. THAT WOULD COVER IT. BUT I'M A BIG QUESTION MARK RIGHT NOW AS TO ALL OF THAT AND SO. I DON'T WANT TO VOTE NO ON YOUR BILL I WANNA GIVE ME TIME TO WORK ON IT AS OF RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE A ONE OF STAINED IS BECAUSE ON HOW BIG THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION. BUT I AM STAYING OPEN TO BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK YOU ARE IMPOSING AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IS ONLINE MEDIA WITH ITS IT. WITH WHEAT WHAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN. YOU KNOW WITH WITH THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS AND AND AND OTHER ONLINE TOOLS ABILITY TO BE ABLE THEM TO MANIPULATE. A CONVERSATION THAT'S REALLY DANGEROUS FOR OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A SEARCH ENGINE OR MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM YOU KNOW USING INFORMATION FROM A SEARCH ENGINE. IT'S. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU ALREADY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING UP WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE ALRIGHT WAS INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE ALREADY SEEKING AND IT'S TO GIVE YOU MORE THAT SAME INFORMATION. I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE GETTING MORE OF THAT SAME INFORMATION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET. WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S OUT THERE THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW FOCUSING TAYLOR TOWARDS YOU I UNDERSTAND OF THE POINT OF WHY IT THAT. THAT THAT THEY DO THAT TO ME MAKES SENSE OF FUN SEARCHING HO YOU KNOW. COOL NIKE SHOES THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET ADS FOR COOL NIKE SHOES BUT WHEN YOU ARE GOOGLING HATE SPEECH YOUR GOOGLING OTHER GROUPS. THAT ARE PROMOTING HATE THAT COULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE GETTING MORE OF THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE COMING FROM A POSITION OF IGNORANCE YOU SHOULDN'T BE GIVING MORE THINGS TO MAKE YOU MORE IGNORANT. AND SO. YOU KNOW I I I JUST I FIND THAT TO BE VERY DANGEROUS TO OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE I THINK REGARDLESS OF THE SITE WHAT WHAT POLITICAL. SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM YOU RESIDE ON THERE HAS TO BE FAITH IN OUR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT I LIKED OFFICIALS TO DO THE JOB TO PROTECT PEOPLE. ABA WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY. YOU KNOW SPOON FED ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT THAT IS THAT'S DISINFORMATION AYE AND MAKES YOU FEEL A CERTAIN WAY. THAT'S DANGEROUS ARE AND AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL IS IS A WAY IT IS A START TO THAT CONVERSATION WHICH I THINK IS IT'S LARGER CONVERSATION BUT MAYBE IT IS AND I WANT TO STAY OPEN TO THAT. BUT AGAIN ANYTHING I CAN DO THAT TEAR TORQUE WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THOUGHT THAT. JUST A LITTLE RISK BY PETRUS Y. PRESHEAF THAT YEAH I MEAN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS IS OPEN UP A CONVERSATION. ABOUT YOU KNOW IN THIS NEW MEDIUM THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT. WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE RIGHT. IT YOU KNOW FROM FROM A SPEECH IN AND AND FROM OTHER. AVENUES RIGHT. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT? YOU ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WENT WITH THE TERMS OF. CAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OF USE IS ALREADY THE PLATFORMS ARE ADOPTING AND INCORPORATE INTO THEIR TERMS AND USES SERVICES THINGS LIKE BULLYING AND THEY WILL. YOU KNOW WE WOULD TAKE DOWN SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW. THAT IS SEEN AS CEO BULLYING TOWARDS A AN INDIVIDUAL. SARTI SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE MARKETPLACE RIGHT AND THOSE CAN BE BUILT INTO THE TERMS. OF SERVICE THE OTHER THING THAT'S THERE IS. ALREADY IN CASE LAW WE DO HAVE BUILT IN PROTECTIONS IT. YOU KNOW IT INCITEMENT SPEECHES NOT PROTECTED SPEECH. THAT UNDER THE LAW IF A IF IF THIS AT THE. IF SOMETHING IS BEING SAID IN ORDER TO INCITE PEOPLE TO VIOLENCE IMMEDIATELY THAT'S NOT PROTECTED SCHOOL BUT THAT BUT AGAIN A THAT'S A GOOD POINT. BUT A SHOOTING THAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY YOU TO. I AND OUR A PUTS OUT A VIDEO COPY WEEKS AGO SAYING. YOU KNOW FIGHT BACK AGAINST YOU TO FOR CENSORING US. COULD THAT BE CONSTRUED AS AS INSIGHTFUL SPEECH EVEN OTHER SAYING FIGHT SO WHERE IS THE LINE SO MY CONCERN IS WHERE IS THE LINE. AND THAT I MEAN AND AND AND I DID SEE THAT TRAGIC EVENT TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS BECAUSE FROM THAT OR NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IT WAS. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT SO I SEE THE ISSUE AND THAT'S AND THAT IS WHAT. WE'VE ACTUALLY GRAPPLED WITH FOR YEARS YOU KNOW FOR. NOW DECADES YOU KNOW IN THE FREE SPEECH DISCUSSIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT IS WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT AND SITES TO VIOLENCE RIGHT YOU KNOW. IS ORGANIZING AT A COMMUNIST RALLY. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE OLD CASES IS JUST ORGANIZE HAS THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS THAT INCITING REVOLUTION AND LEADING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVENTUALLY WE SAID. NOTS NOT REALLY ENOUGH GUYS RIGHT. YEAH YOU KNOW THERE'S SO THERE IS SOME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THOSE LINES ARE CONTINUALLY BEING DRAWN RIGHT. BUT WHAT WE DO OPEN UP A PUBLIC FORUM WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT SPEECH IS PROTECTED. AND WE ALSO ALREADY HAVE THE LEGAL PARAMETERS IN PLACE TO TO PROHIBIT THINGS AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES WOULD BE. WELL WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO PROHIBIT THINGS THAT ARE INCITEMENT OBSCENITY. AND DEFAMATION. RIGHT SO THERE'S THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE NOT PROTECTED SPEECH THE PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO PROHIBIT. AND THEN THEY CAN ALSO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS INTO THEIR TERMS. A OF SERVICES LONG AS THAT'S CLEAR SO THE CONSUMER KNOWS HEY WHEN I'M USING THIS. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROHIBITED. RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE IS AN OPEN FORUM BUT THEN IF WE DON'T LIKE IN CERTAIN CASES MAYBE IF WE DON'T LIKE YOUR SPEECH. WILL SUPPRESS IT AND THAT BECOMES DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN OUR MODERN ERA. WELL WE WANT A FREE FLOWING DEBATE RIGHT WE WANT TO HAVE A BUNCH OF IDEAS EXPRESSED. AND WE ARE THOSE THAT ARE NOT GOOD IDEAS CAN ALSO BE CALLED OUT RIGHT IN THE MARKETPLACE OF ABOUT A OF IDEAS WILL FIND THE FALSE. I AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S ALSO THE PROBLEM OF PEOPLE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE INSULAR ON BOTH SIDES RIGHT YEAH LIKE THEY WERE ONLY WANT TO HEAR THIS. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS MORE LAUGHTER IT'S MORE RIGHT. AT LEAST ONE THING THAT WE SAW WITH THE WHOLE. NOT YOU KNOW THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IS A DATE THEY FOOLED PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES RIGHT WITH WITH FALSE STORIES THEY GOT PEOPLE FIRED UP ON THE LEFT AND THEY GOT PEOPLE FIRED UP. ON THE RIGHT IN AND SEVERAL OUT OF WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF HALEY SINGS ARE BEING USED TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE. RIGHT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS PROTECT A FREE FLOWING. DEBATE OF IDEAS AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GO AT THIS BILL. WHILE ALSO PROTECTING AGAINST THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW OUR ARE NOT PROTECTED SPEECH. YOU KNOW MAYBE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION YOU DON'T MIND AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MONOPOLIZING THE TIME HERE FROM THE UP TO THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW WHAT WITH WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE TERMS AND USES. YOU KNOW THAT THE SERVICE AGREEMENT. YOU DON'T DOES THAT CHANGE THE CALCULUS WHEN IT COMES TO BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO EXAMINE THIS MORE I MEAN. YOU KNOW WHERE DOES THAT PUT YOU GUYS. YOU KNOW MOST LIKELY ON THE BILL. YOU KNOW CONSIDERING THAT. WELL THE. THE FOLKS ON TERMS SERVICE I THINK IS A POSITIVE CHANGE FOR THE BILL. THERE'S TWO PIECES OF THE BILL ONE ON CENSORING REMOVING CONTENT WHICH SEEMS TO BE MOST OF THE DISCUSSION DAYS FOCUSED ON. THE SECOND PIECE IS MANIPULATING THE CONTENT AND THAT'S A PART OF HIM STILL THINK. HAS AN ISSUE. WITH THE TERMS OF SERVICE BECAUSE MANIPULATING CAN MEAN ONE THING FOR THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BY I THINK WHERE HE'S GOING. BUT IT ALSO COULD BE JUST WHAT THE PLATFORM SHOW CUSTOMERS WHAT THESE USES THE PLATFORM'S WANT TO SEE HOW THE ALGORITHMS WORK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I SEEN. SO. I DON'T THINK THE TERMS OF SERVICE TODAY REALLY GET INTO ALL THAT. AND SO THAT'S THE THING I MOVED TO MY OPENING. THAT. THE TERMS OF SERVICE MAY HAVE TO BECOME MUCH LONGER WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY. HAS. HAD ISSUES WITH IN THE PAST. AND WE'RE NOT SURE THAT REALLY ACCOMPLISHED TRANSPARENCY I THINK THE AUTHORS GOING AFTER SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD. MARIAH AT MA'AM I IT I KEEP GETTING HUNG UP ON YOU KNOW POLITICAL SPEECH WHAT IS THAT WHAT QUALIFIES UNDER POLITICAL SPEECH AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY BROAD. AND OPENS UP A LOT OF CONVERSATION. OR A POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW I LITIGATION THAT AND THAT IS MY CONCERN I'D LIKE I JUST I DON'T WANT US TO HANDCUFF OURSELVES. AND HANDCUFF OUR STATE IN PARTICULAR. FOR BEING ABLE TO REMOVE ATTENTION A DANGEROUS. INFORMATION ONLINE I AM WITH YOU I DON'T THINK WE'RE GODLESS OF WHAT SIDE IT'S ON YOU SHOULDN'T BE SUPPRESSING. ANY TYPE OF. YOU KNOW INFORMATION JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH IT BEING WHAT YOU KNOW RIGHT OR LEFT. BUT I MEAN THAT BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT MY CONCERN IS IT'S MORE ARE WE HANDCUFFING OURSELVES FROM BEING ABLE TO TO REMOVE. THAT TYPE OF SPEECH ARE THAT THAT COULD CAUSE HARM. I THINK EVERY TIME IT WAS BERMAN. YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU. MISTER GALLAGHER FOR BRING THE BILL IT'S IT IS A CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION AND I AND ONE THAT'S. STILL VERY CONFUSING. IN TERMS OF HOW WE ADDRESS A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE YOUR RIGHT ARM. CHAIR OF THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE HAD THAT. JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING WITH THE SENATE SIDE ON CYBERSECURITY ISSUES AROUND ELECTIONS AND A LOT OF THAT IS THE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. THAT VARIOUS NEFARIOUS ACTORS ARE CONDUCTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS. THE HIGH LEVEL CONCERN I HAVE IS I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY DIGEST THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE THIS MORNING. AND AND THAT GETS ME A LITTLE BIT A PAUSE. ON SUPPORTING SOMETHING TODAY. BUT THEN IT'S UP. IT'S ALSO. HOW CAN WE I AGREE WITH THE GOAL OF NOT WANTING TO? INFRINGE ON ON POLITICAL SPEECH. I STILL NEED TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS IDEA THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE IS A PUBLIC FORUM. AND AND I DON'T YEAH IT IT'S A CONVERSATION I'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE OF AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'M FULLY THERE YET. BY BUT THEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ARE ASKING OUR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO BE MORE DISCERNING. IN IN THAT TYPES OF OF POSTS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING ON THEIR PLATFORMS AND BOOSTING ON THEIR PLATFORMS BECAUSE WE SAW. ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT. YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS MANIPULATION OF VOTERS ON BOTH SIDES. AND. IN THEORY I LOVE THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW IF HE GETS OUT THERE THAN PEOPLE WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG. BUT I THINK THAT THAT WASN'T BORN OUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN RESULTS AND AND A LOT OF THE. THINGS WE'VE LEARNED AFTER THE FACT AND SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET AND I THINK. MORE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANIES. TO BETTER. KIND OF REVIEW AND REGULATE. SOME OF THE POSTS THAT ARE BEING MADE THAT ARE WHO THAT I MADE SOLELY WITH THE GOAL OF CONFUSING PEOPLE. AND AND YOU KNOW MISINFORMING THE PUBLIC SO. AND THEN THE OTHER SAYS WELL YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN'T. DIE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT TERMINOLOGY TO CHANGE SOMETHING OR PULL IT DOWN BY SOME POLITICAL SPEECH SO WHAT IF THE YOU KNOW THESE NEFARIOUS ACTOR START EVERY POST WITH I'M A DEMOCRAT. AND AND THEN THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IDEA HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STILL ON ABILITY AND MAYBE THAT'S ADDRESSED IN HERE. AND SO I ASK THAT THE AUTHOR BUT YEAH THESE ARE JUST CONCERNS AND AN OPEN QUESTIONS THAT I STILL HAVE THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE. TO TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT AND AND REALLY GET ANSWERS TO. YEAH ME AND AND IT IS TOUGH I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT DISCERNMENT RIGHT AND AND I GUESS. RIGHT NOW THE STATUS QUO IS IS REALLY THAT DID THE COMPLETE AND TOTAL THE SERMON IS IN THE HANDS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE COMPANY. RAY I MEAN THEY DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO EITHER REMOVE. OR DELETE OR YEAH. SO IS IS IS THAT WE WANT THE DISCERNMENT DO YOU. DO YOU WANT AND THEY HAD THE GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT CAN BE IS THAT AS YOU KNOW A STICKY WHEN YOU WRITE AND YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINING. WHAT IS NEFARIOUS SPEECH AND WHAT IS NOT RIGHT? I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE TRADITIONALLY YOU KNOW IN OUR SYSTEM IS THAT WOULD WE ALLOW FREE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS SO THAT THE THE FREE MARKETPLACE WILL EXPOSE THOSE IDEAS THAT. ARE LESSER THEN AND WILL PROMOTE THOSE THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. YOU THE GREATER GOOD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ULTIMATELY PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT THESE ARE THE. THESE ARE THE BETTER IDEAS IN THE WORKABLE IDEAS. AND YOU KNOW THOSE WHEN THE DAY HOWEVER. YOU KNOW YES WE HAVE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE FALSE THINGS HAVE BEEN PUT OUT THERE. I AM POLITICS THAT CERTAINLY NOTHING NEW RIGHT I MEAN WE'VE SEEN OF. AYE I THINK GOING BACK TO OUR FOUNDERS WE HAD LETTER WRITERS WHO WOULD WRITE THINGS THAT WERE. NOT TRUE ABOUT CANDIDATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT NOW EXISTS IN THIS NEW WORLD OF. A OF YOU KNOW FACEBOOK AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES WHERE YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THINGS BUT THE OTHER GET OUT THERE WITH MAYBE MUCH MORE EXPOSURE RIGHT. AND AND THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS LIKE IN IN TERMS OF A PUBLIC FORUM. BUT IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW LIKE FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE IS MUCH MORE OF A PUBLIC FORUM. PROBABLY THEN THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL RIGHT. THE PEOPLE HAVE RALLIES HERE ALL THE TIME BUT YOU PROBABLY SEE A LOT MORE DIFFERENT. IDEAS BEING EXPRESSED AND THINK COMING BACK AND FORTH MORE SO IN THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD AND INFLUENCING WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT. POLITICS AND ISSUES MUCH MORE SO THAN PEOPLE HOLDING A RALLY. NOW ON THE CAPITOL STEPS RIGHT I MEAN. AND SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT AND I MEAN THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHERE DO. BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EVENTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THIS IN THE MODERN WORLD HOW WE PROTECT SPEECH RIGHTS THAT'S KIND OF MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE HERE. YOU KNOW IN THIS KIND A NEW MODERN WORLD WHERE THIS IS HOW PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR IDEAS IN A IN A FORUM YEAH NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THAT I. MIGHT MIGHT YOU KNOW WINNING LOTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS IN AND. PROTECTING SPEECH RIGHT AND I I STILL ALSO I NEED TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OF. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE. DONE WHERE IS HARM BEING DONE CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF OF. RESTRICTING SPEECH RIGHTS. BECAUSE. IT'S IF THAT'S NOT REALLY HAPPENING AND WE TAKE ACTIONS THAT INHIBIT THE COMPANY'S ABILITIES. INTO TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE POST IN TERMS OF THE MISINFORMATION AND YOU KNOW THEN WE'VE KIND OF SHOT HERSELF IN THE FOOT IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING WHAT I THINK IS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE FACE GOING INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS. SO VERY FUN PHILOSOPHICAL LEGAL CONVERSATIONS I DIDN'T US UP MY CONLON TEXTBOOKS I'M GONNA HAVE TO. BUT. I IT'S I I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M AT NOW I'M LEANING TOWARDS OF STANDING. BUT DO YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW THAT IN THE THIS TO MORE TIME AFTER TODAY IN ONE HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS I GET A LITTLE BIT ARE STANDING OF THINGS. WHICH ARE OPEN NOT. SHARE FIVE MISTER GALLAGHER VERY APPRECIATIVE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. I HAD MEASURE WHERE SOME SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE BILL HAD DEFINED SOCIAL MEDIA. AND YOU'VE ADDRESSED A LOT OF THOSE IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUT I JUST SAW THIS AFTERNOON. I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN FREE SPEECH YEAH AND COMMERCIALISM. BECAUSE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW SOCIAL MEDIA SITES LIKE FACEBOOK OR THE NEW TOWN SQUARE. AND THAT'S WHERE PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS OCCUR BUT. OUR THE WAY THAT YOU DID EVEN THE AMENDMENTS TO FIND. THE SOCIAL MEDIA. LEAVES ME OPEN THE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE A COMPANY AND YOU HAVE A PUBLIC FORUM TO DISCUSS YOUR PRODUCTS. AND THE CUSTOMER GETS ON THERE AND SAYS YOUR PRODUCT STINK I'M NEVER BUYING THEM I URGE EVERYONE ELSE STOPPED BY THE MID YOU HAVE A RIGHT. TO CENSOR THAT CONTENT BECAUSE UNDER THE NEW THE AMENDED DEFINITION I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER NOT YOU DO I MEAN I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE INTERPRETED AS FREE SPEECH WHAT EFFORTS. PATENTLY FALSE SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE ABOUT YOUR PRODUCTS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CENSOR THAT I JUST THINK IT'S A VERY. KIND OF ARE INTERESTING BUT DICEY ISSUE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY DELIBERATE ABOUT BECAUSE. OF THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO IS BE AMBIGUOUS WHEN WE WRITE LANGUAGE LIKE THIS AND JUST THROW IT OPEN TO THE COURTS. IT I THINK WE WE OWE IT REAL A DUTY TO TO BE SAYS SPECIFIC AS WE CARE AND I FEEL LIKE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS HERE TO NON FISCAL BILL AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU BECAUSE I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE YOU. TO TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH PEOPLE IS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE. IN I'D I JUST DON'T THINK IS THERE YET AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S VERY RUSHED. LIKE TELL YOU WHAT MY INTENT IS IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LET'S SAY YOU CREATED A PAGE ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT. RIGHT. CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE CREATING A PAGE LIKE WE ALL CREATE PAGES FOR OUR. A NEO FOR OURSELVES RIGHT AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE RUNNING THAT PAID YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO. DETERMINE WHAT CONTENTS GOING TO BE ON THAT PAGE YOU KNOW AND AND PEOPLE EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. OUT OF THE GAME BUT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. IT'S REALLY ABOUT. THE THE. THE HOST OF THE FORUM. YEAH THE PIECE MEAL LARGER COMPANIES WHO ARE HOSTING THESE FORMS THEN DETERMINING WELL I DON'T. EITHER SUPPRESSING NEO THINGS THAT ARE ON YOUR PAGE OR THINGS THAT ARE ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PAGES OR THINGS THAT ARE BEING SHARED. IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE SUPPRESSING THE SPEECH RIGHT TO THE PERSON THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT I'M GOING NOT TO WHERE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL. KINDA CONTROL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS OR THEIR IDEAS THAT THERE. THAT ARE PART OF THEIR GROUP. AND I THINK WE'VE GOT OUT OF THAT A LITTLE BIT WITH THE LANGUAGE BUT I REALIZE IT'S NOT PERFECT AND SO THE THING I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE. HIS I I YOU KNOW. I'M NOT GOING TO STEAMROLL THIS THING. I THINK LOOK I CAN'T SCHEME DISSIPATE RIGHT AND HIM AND. FLAWS AS A REALITY RIGHT. WHAT I WANNA DO IS CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT AND EVEN IF WE DON'T GET THERE THIS YEAR WE WILL WILL HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION MAY WE CAN MOVE NET IN THE NEXT YEAR? CONTINUED ON THAT BUT I WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE ITS I'D ASK THAT WE'D. YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT OF ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION I'D ADDED NO THEIR OPPOSITION UNTIL YESTERDAY YOU KNOW SO. I I WENT. AFTER I HEARD THAT AND TRY TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TOOK IT BUT TOOK INPUT FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO WE'RE ALL WORKING KIND OF. ON A QUICK TIMEFRAME. BUT AS WE MOVE IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE ITS TOSS TO GO TO ANOTHER POLICY COMMITTEE. WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE TIME SO I MEAN IT'S A. SO TO ME I WOULD ASKS IT LEAST THE THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE IN MOVING THE BILL FOR WE HAVE MADE CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE. AND NOBODY'S GONNA JUST YOU KNOW. PUSH THIS THING THROUGH WITHOUT A LOT OF FURTHER DISCUSSION. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR. QUESTIONS SEEING NINE. LET ME. ME SAY. A COUPLE REMARKS ARE WE DO LIVE IN THE IN A A TIME IN WHICH. THE MORE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC FORUM MORE FOR. BEING GRADUALLY REPLACE WITH PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER'S AND AND THE LIKE AND AND THAT'S WHERE THE DEBATES AND. DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HELD. SO I THINK WE WANT APPROACH OUR. PROCESS OR A LAW MAKING PROCESSES OF FROM A DIFFERENT WITH A DIFFERENT MINDSET AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW ON THE SURFACE THE BILL SEEMS TO BE ARM. CONTINUE TRUMP SO THAT'S WHAT KIND OF PROMPTED ME TO KIND OF CONTINUE ON WITH IT. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING. A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS ON THE LAST MINUTE. OF REQUEST AND AND I HOPE THIS IS THE IN OPPORTUNITY FOR IS TO BASICALLY CONTINUE A DIALOGUE THAT WHICH WE STARTED TODAY. AND AND I THINK WE WANT TO EXPLORE IDEAS THAT YOU KNOW COULD FINE TUNE THIS THIS BILL. SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY AND I'M HOME HOPING TO MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU CONTINUOUSLY A IN THE MONTHS TO COME SO. SO WITH THAT DA HELL IDENTITY IN MOTION. OKAY DO I HAVE A SECOND. WE DO HAVE A. MOTION AND SECOND. SO. SO WITH THAT THE AYE. I'M GONNA ASK. AND SECRETARY TO. THE LOCAL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ARTS ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS TOURISM AND INTERNET MEDIA COMMITTEE. CHAO HELD BY CHILD BY KILEY. BAKER. BERMAN. CALDERON. IRWIN. MULLIN. OBERNOLTE. REST. TING. IT YOU NEED A FEW MORE. THANK YOU IS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WITH THAT MISTER CALDERON YOU HAVE A BILL. ITEM. THREE HATS AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT. ELECTRONIC RECORDS WELL MY. WITNESSES MAKE THEIR WAY UP UNDER GO AHEAD GET AND START GET STARTED THAT ARE YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT% COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS I'D ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS BILLS WORK IN PROGRESS AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING. WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER. REFINE THE LANGUAGE AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS GRANTED IS. AN ISSUE ARE A VERY NEW. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THIS HOUSE. THIS BILL WILL DEFINE AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT WILL DEFINE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN STATUTE AND WILL PROVIDE A GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY FOR THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATION ECONOMY. A BLOCKCHAIN IS A TYPE OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGER THAT KEEPS CONTINUOUSLY UPDATING DIGITAL RECORDS AS A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER IT DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRAL ADMINISTRATOR. BUT RATHER A NETWORK OF REPLICATED DATABASES WHICH ARE SYNCHRONIZED VIA THE INTERNET. THE INNOVATION A BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS THAT TRANSACTION TRANSACTIONS ARE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEERS NO LONGER NEED A CENTRAL AUTHORITY TO VALIDATE THEM LIKE A BANK. BLOCKCHAIN ALLOWS. PARTIES WHO HAVE NEVER MET AND HAVE LITTLE REASON TO TRUST EACH OTHER TO CONDUCT SENSITIVE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY EXCUSE ME EFFICIENTLY. THIS PROVIDES BOTH SECURITY AND EFFICIENCY BENEFITS TO POTENTIAL USERS BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES. DEFINING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN STATUTE WILL PROVIDE BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY GREATER CERTAINTY SUCH THAT IF THEY DECIDE TO UTILIZE THE SAKE TECHNOLOGY IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS AN ELECTRONIC RECORD UNDER THE UNIFORM ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACT. WITHOUT KNOWING THE LEGAL STANDARD STANDING A BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY MIGHT AVOID INNOVATING OR UTILIZING BLOCKCHAIN AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY DEFINES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE THAT CERTAINTY AND TO FOSTER INNOVATION WITH BLOCKCHAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA STILL ULTIMATELY THE BOB THE POINT OF THE BILL IS TO DEFINE. BLOCKCHAIN BUT ALSO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO BE AN INNOVATOR. IN ALL THINGS TECHNOLOGY AND SPECIFIC TO THIS CONVERSATION A BLOCKING WE WE WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST. TO DO THIS AND WE KEEP OURSELVES OPEN TO THIS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DAYS IT DAVID. GRASS BLACK UP FROM FOUNDERS DOJO ALONG WITH SOME OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS SIDE WHEN HIS PLACE. MY NAME IS GOING OTHER MOST STORY AND THE COFOUNDER AND THE C. E. O. OF OVERCLOCK LABS. OUR AUGUST NETWORK IS A BLOCKCHAIN BASED OPEN MARKETPLACE FOR CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT. I LIKE TO THANK MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON. GERMAN CHILD VICE CHAIRMAN KILEY AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT AREA OF TECHNOLOGICAL. DEVELOPMENT. BLOCKING TECHNOLOGY IS IT IS IN ITS INFANCY. BUT ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON BENEFITS FOR THE COMMERCE RIVALS THAT OF THE WORLDWIDE WEB ITSELF. AS WITH WEB TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA IS OF THE FOUR MOST FOREFRONT OF INNOVATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE OF FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTING IT EDUCATING CONSUMERS. AS INNOVATION PROCEEDS AT ARE EVER INCREASING US BEAT. IN MY OPINION EXPANDING YOU ETS DEFINITION OFF THAT TRACK RECORD AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TO INCLUDE AND RECORD OUR SIGNATURE THAT IS SECURE THROUGH THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. THE NO BRAINER. WIFE BECAUSE BLOCKCHAIN IS INHERENTLY IMMUTABLE AND AUDITABLE. IN OTHER WORDS ONCE A WRECK IT IS WRITTEN TO A BLOCKCHAIN. IT IS THEREFORE EVER. IT CANNOT BE ALTERED AND IT IS VISIBLE TO ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO THE CHASE. A BLOCKCHAIN IS A DATABASE THAT GOD BE HACKED. FURTHERMORE SECURITY IS BAKED INTO THE CRYPTOGRAPHY. WHEN I SIGNED THE RECORD WITH MY PUBLIC KEY IT IS UNALTERABLY ATTRIBUTE IT TO ME ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. THIS IS BECAUSE A CRYPTOGRAPHY KEY IS ACTUALLY A PAIR OF KEYS. A PUBLIC KEY SEEN BY EVERYONE GIANT MATHEMATICALLY TO A PRIVATE KEY. SEEN ONLY BY ME. SO I BAD ACTOR CANNOT HACKETT DATABASES TO MY PASTOR BECAUSE MY PRIVATE KEY NEVER LEAVES MY COMPUTER. HOWEVER. I SUGGEST CAUTION REGARDING SMALL CONTRACTS. WRITTEN CONTRACTS ARE ALL OFTEN ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BUT THERE. BERKELEY ASSEMBLY THEORETICALLY HUMAN READABLE. SMART CONTRACTS ON THE OTHER HAND. ARE WRITTEN IN COMPUTER CODE. AS A PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER. IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE. TO SAY NOTHING OFTEN. ABILITY TO DO SO. AND OF COURSE COURT OFTEN HAS BUGS WHICH CAUSED UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR. AS A RESULT THERE'S A GREATER RISK FOR IT OFFICE PERSON COMMITTING TO ESPOT CONTRACT THAT HAS PROVISIONS THAT THERE ARE EVEN THE CONTRACT WE SURE DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND. IN MY OPINION LEGISLATION REGARDS WHAT CONTRACTS MUST. CONSIDER THESE IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS SO I SUPPORT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. AGAIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I REPORT TO COLLABORATE IN THE FUTURE AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE LIMITING SMART CONTRACTS FROM THE BILL AND JUST TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF THE BLOCKCHAIN IT IS ELECTRONIC LEDGER. THAT CANNOT BE HACKED A ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO AYE IT'S AN AUDITABLE AUDITABLE THE CONTRACT WHERE YOU WHICH PROVIDES THAT CERTAINTY OF DOING THAT TRANSACTION THEN THAT BUSINESS. BUT IT'S NOT EASILY HACKED OR NOT POSSIBLE TO HACK BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO HACK JUST ONE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT GROUPS. INFORMATION YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HACK EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION AYE AN ORDER TO DO IT AND THAT IS CONSTANTLY VERIFYING CONSTANTLY BUILDING AND THAT'S WHY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HACK THIS AND THAT'S WILL PROVIDE THAT CERTAINTY. OF THIS BLOCKING TECHNOLOGY WHAT'S WERE PROVIDES A CERTAINTY OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A A DECENTRALIZED APPROACH TO. VIA THAT THIS TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS WE STEPPED AYE TRANSACTIONS ONLINE.

THE AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS TAMPON FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT WE'VE BEEN SHARING WITH AUTHORED STAFF. HERE POLICY COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE FOR YOU. A UNDERSTAND IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH US AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. I'M JUST REAL QUICKLY IS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY HOWEVER THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE RESPECTFULLY. SUGGESTS THAT IT DOES NOT DO THAT FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS AS THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A AND A UNIFORM ESTABLISHED. STANDARD FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES PLOTTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE SIX OR SEVEN BILLS. THAT OTHER STATES HAVE HAVE STARTED DOWN THIS ROAD THEY USE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGIES THE UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION IS NOT. ENGAGE IN THIS EFFORT. AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH. TO. TO DEFINE THE TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THAT IS ONE OF OUR CONCERNS ANOTHER IS THAT. IN VERMONT IN PARTICULAR WHERE. WHERE ELISE THAT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE IDEA BEHIND THE LEGISLATION THAT? THE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED THERE FOLLOWING ABOUT A TWO YEAR. UNSTEADY WE'D WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHEN YOU JUST LOOK UP RESEARCH AROUND BLOCKCHAIN. YOU SEE THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF PROPONENTS OF COURSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS INCLUDING PRIVACY CONCERNS. BECAUSE OF THE IMMUTABLE NATURE. OF IT I'M. MY COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED THE BILL IS MADE UP OF COMPLEX LITIGATION JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS VERY SOPHISTICATED THESE ARE NOT LET AYE IT'S. AND THEY LOOK AT THE CURRENT DEFINITION AND DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO IMPLEMENT THAT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TERMS OF THE. THE DEFINITION TO TO TO MEET THE GOAL. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT WE'VE NOT HEARD YET ANY REAL WORLD EXAMPLES OF HEARING CALIFORNIA A CASE. THAT WAS NOT ABLE TO BE BROADER HAD SOME CONFUSION IN TERMS OF HOW WAS LITIGATED BECAUSE OF THE LACK. OF A DEFINITION OF WHAT TRAIN TECHNOLOGY IF WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE. OF WHAT THEIR REAL CONCERN IS IN THE LEGAL WORLD. A ABOUT THAT. ABOUT THE NEED THEN PERHAPS WE COULD HELP WITH WHERE IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE CODES HOW TO BETTER DEFINE IT. TO PROVIDE THE CERTAINTY THAT THAT WE KNOW THAT YEAR. SEEKING THE FINAL THING THAT M. THAT MY FOLKS WANTED TO BRING OUT IS THAT THAT WE KNOW THIS IS AN EMERGING IN REALLY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE SOMEONE TOLD ME I SHOULD MENTION. CUBIT WHICH I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW EVEN WHAT IT MEANS BUT I'M TOLD THAT IT COULD REPLACE OR BE A NEW AND DIFFERENT. WAY OF ADDRESSING YOU KNOW THESE KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS ARE WE GOING TO UPDATE OUR CODES. EVERYTIME THERE IS ONE OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD. TO TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF YOUR POLICY COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS AS THE BILL MOVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OF IF I JUST TO MAKE SURE OF IS THAT OUR FI I RESPECT THE POSITION. JUDICIAL COUNCIL I ABSOLUTELY AM GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM I MEAN APART THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF LANGUAGE OUT THERE WITH REGARDS THIS TECHNOLOGY WE'RE TRYING TO DO WAS. AS HONE IN ON AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO WAS ALSO CREATED A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN UNABLE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO AT LEAST YOU KNOW BE. BE WORKED ON HERE CREATED HERE AND CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE APPARENTLY DOESN'T EXIST ONE THERE THERE'S NOT ONE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO SET A STANDARD. I'M NOT JUST NATIONALLY BUT WORLDWIDE BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS NO FRAMEWORK WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE REASON WHY WE ARE FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CHARACTER CURRENCY AS AS A BIT BIT POINT. IS BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL MARKET WHERE A LOT OF DOLLARS AND A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION IS BEING PLACE TO IT AND SO. YOU KNOW IF THE IF YOU KNOW IF IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE THIS INNOVATION HA BAY INNOVATION HUB WE NEED TO START COMING UP WITH THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ABOUT THE DEFINITIONS ARE KIND OF THE START OF THAT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND AGAIN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OUGHT TO HELP US KIND OF HONE IN ON THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE. TO GET BACK IS AGAIN THAT THERE'S THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE FOR US TO LOOK TO TRY TO DEFINE WHAT THAT IS IT'S WHAT WE YOU KNOW WE ARE CREATING AN. ABSOLUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION OR NEUTRAL. YES I HAD. HIGH ON MY NAME IS ANDREW CLINTON. I REPRESENT A BLOCKCHAIN AT BERKELEY LAW. I AM THE HEAD OF LEGAL RESEARCH THERE. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF. AN INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP. ON. DISTRIBUTE LEISURE TECHNOLOGY ALSO KNOWN AS BITCOIN PARA BLOCKCHAIN. AND. I I'M RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT I OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE I VERY MUCH. SUPPORT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATION IN UP PROMOTING. LEGAL AND REGULATORY CERTAINTY. SURROUNDING THIS TECHNOLOGY. BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BILL. AM FIRST AND FOREMOST A LOT OF THE. LEGAL CHALLENGES. THAT DIGITAL ASSETS FACE. ARE NOT PRIMARILY AT THE STATE LEVEL. THEY THERE ARE CERTAINLY SO IT IS KIND OF A MYTH THAT. DECLINE IS UNREGULATED IT IT IS ACTUALLY REGULATED. PRIMARILY UNDER MONEY TRANSMISSION STATUTES. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF FINS AND. AND UNDER THE BANK SECRECY ACT. HOWEVER THAT HAS RESULTED IN THE REGULATORY REGIME ARE BEING VERY FRACTURED THE PATCHWORK OF STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION. INVOLVING FENCE AND THE CFTC THE SEC THE IRA S.. AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES AND SO. ARE THE BASIC CONCERN IS THEY THE YOUNG THE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY THAT EXISTS IS PRIMARILY NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL NOW I THINK THERE ARE THINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT CAN BE DONE. BUT HONESTLY DEFINING A BLOCKCHAIN IS NOT REALLY THAT THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE. THE ELECTRONIC RECORDS ACT AS IT CURRENTLY ALREADY EXISTS. IS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. AND I THINK THAT THAT THE DEFINITION IS VERY. CONCERNING TO ME. BECAUSE IT USES TERMINOLOGY LIKE A A DECENTRALIZED SHARED AND RECIPROCAL LEDGER. WELL DECENTRALIZATION CAN IS A PARAMETER THAT IS EXIST ON A SPECTRUM ITS NOT A BINARY IT'S NOT IT IS DECENTRALIZED OR IT'S NOT. IT IS. IF THINGS CAN BE MORE OR LESS CENTRALIZED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. SIMILARLY. I AM NOT QUITE CLEAR ON WHAT A RECIPROCAL LEDGER MEANS. THE BILL SAYS THAT A BOXING IS DRIVEN BY TALKING I SCRIPT OF ECONOMICS. THE TERM CRYPTO ECONOMICS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS EVER BEEN. HOUSTON AS STATUTE I'M NOT SURE ANYONE KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS TO BE HONEST. AND THEN FINALLY IN THE IN THE SECOND SENTENCE ARE DESCRIBING BLOCKING TECHNOLOGY. IT SAYS THE DATA ON THE LEDGER IS PROTECTED WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY. IT'S NOT. IS IMMUTABLE. IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY. IS AUDITABLE IT MAY NOT BE THERE ARE A PROTOCOL SUCH AS HE CASH IN THE NARROW WHICH OUR PRIVACY PRESERVING. AND WHICH ARE NOT IN FACT AUDITABLE. AND PROVIDES AN UNCENSORED TRUTH AND I THINK THAT IT CAN BE VERY MISLEADING BECAUSE A BLOCKCHAIN CAN RECORD. CAN RECORD THAT A STATEMENT OR TRANSACTION WAS MADE BUT NOT THE TRUTH NOT THE UNDERLYING TRUTH OF THAT. SO I CAN SAY THE SKY IS PURPLE AND A BLOCKING CAN RECORD THAT IN ALMOST PERPETUITY. THAT I SAID THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT. IN FACT MAKE THE SKY PURPLE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS. WITH THAT. AND I A I HEARD THAT THE BIT ABOUT SMART CONTRACTS. WAS WAS STRUCK SO I I GUESS I WANT. COME INTO THAT. BUT I DO HAVE ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE. THAT THAT COULD BE ADOPTED. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. I AM ABLE TO IDENTIFY ABOUT A HALF DOZEN. AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THAT COULD BE AMENDED THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE. SIGNIFICANT CLARITY AND BENEFITS. FOR THE INDUSTRY ON WHICH I'M HAPPY GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON ALL OF THOSE. SHOULD THE COMMITTEE WISH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO INVITE YOU TO. CONTINUE CONTACTING THE AUTHORS OFFICER WITH YOUR INPUT AND SUGGESTIONS AND THE MONTHS TO COME. ARM CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST MEDIA THAT THE BILLS ARE HURT THE BILL AND. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO MOVE A FORCE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND. AND. S. B. NATION BLOCKCHAIN IS INDEED TO THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GONNA. RECEIVE A LOT OF ATTENTION IN IN IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME IN AND TALK THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY. PICKLING IS BASED ON. WATCHING AND I'M. DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR STAYING AHEAD OF THE CURVE OR STAYING WITH THE CURVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE OF THINGS ARE GOING TO. SO IN FACT MY TEAM ARE HAS LOOKED AT. BLOCKCHAIN ALSO IN A LITTLE BIT SO I'M I I'M THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE. THE LEADERSHIP AND INITIATIVE AND AND. DOING BUILT SO. SO WITH THAT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL OP OPPOSITION INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT OKAY GET PLEASE. I'LL TAKE IT. OKAY ABOVE I PAUSES RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF CIRCLE PAY WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. TIME IN THE STAFF WORK WITH US. UNDERSTANDING THE BILL. WERE SUPER SUPPORTIVE WE'RE GLAD THE CONVERSATION'S GETTING STARTED HERE AND THIS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF. DOT TIME IN LANGUAGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN THANK YOU ABSOLUTE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS OR OPPONENTS. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE. MISTER OBERNOLTE PLACE THANK YOU SHARE OUT SOMEONE CALDERON OF THANK YOU FOR DON'T BRING THE BILL FORWARD I'M EXTREMELY JEALOUS THAT I DIDN'T THINK OF IT FIRST. BOB I TOGETHER. WHAT SURE PEPPY CO AUTHOR FEEL I'D? LIKE ARCHITECT I'M AUTHORS DONE. I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY RELIES APOLOGIST TOOK THE DEFINITION OF THE ARIZONA BILL. A BUT I THINK IT DOES NEED SOME REFINEMENT PARTICULARLY IN THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS TO MAKE IT MAKE SURE THAT WERE BEING VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN. WHEN WE SAY BLOCKCHAIN BUT I WITH THAT COPY OUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THANK YOU AND ANNA AND I DO COMMIT TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT. TAKING THE TIME TO TRY TO DEVELOP A BETTER PROGRAM OR A BETTER DEFINITION WHEN IT COMES TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS MICHAEL. AND YOU KNOW TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WE EXPECT THAT TO BE TAKEN NEW AMENDMENTS IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AYE I WILL ABSOLUTELY DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT WE STRUCK RIGHT BALLOTS. THANK YOU MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SCENE NINE. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. I THINK YOU MEMBERS APPRECIATE YOUR TIME HOUSE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THOSE THAT SPOKEN SUPPORT AS WELL AS OPPOSITION I TAKE ALL. CRITICISMS. SERIOUSLY NOW AFFORD TO WORKING ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE KALRA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED HIS UNIT JUDICIARY. CHAO HIGH SO I KILEY BAKER. BERMAN I'VE BERMAN AYE CALDERON AYE CALDERON AYE IRWIN. IRWIN AYE MULLIN. MULLIN AYE OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE I REST RAVES I TING. TING AYE. YOUR BILL IS OUT. THANK CONGRATULATIONS IN THAT LEAVES OF. ONE BILL AND THAT'S MY BILL I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO MY VICE CHAIRS ON HERE SO. MISS OBERNOLTE WHICH LIKE THE CHAIR. REST OF THE MEETING. NTIA. WE THEN THAT IF YOU CAN SAID SHE TOLD ME. SHE. SHE DEAD. OKAY PENETRATE SHALL BELIEVE YOU'RE PRESENTING ON AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY TWO PLEASE RC THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER AND A MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY TWO WILL ESTABLISH AND FUND A PROGRAM TO STUDY THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. TO DATE THERE ARE NOT MUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THE EXTENDED USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA. AND THE EFFECTS IT CAN HAVE ON THE COGNITIVE PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. AND ADOLESCENTS ADDITIONALLY NOT MUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO MORE THOROUGHLY EXAMINE THE USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA TO SUPPORT HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME STATISTICS TODAY EIGHTY ARE NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF CHILDREN IN AMERICA ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT. HAVE ACCESS TO A MOBILE DEVICE AT HOME. SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF TEENAGERS CHECK THEIR DIGITAL DEVICES AT LEAST HOURLY. AND FIFTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS REPORTED FEELING ADDICTED TO THEIR MOTHER MOBILE DEVICES. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE BRAINS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH INTERNET ADDICTION. CHAU SIGNIFICANT ALL LESS GRAY MATTER DENSITY WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH PLANNING DECISION MAKING AND IMPOSE CONTROL. THE RAPID RISE OF TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL DEVICE USE AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS HAVE HAS CREATED A PRESSING NEED. TO EXPAND RESEARCH INTO THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF TECHNOLOGY USE AND ALSO POSSIBLE DIGITAL ADDICTIONS. AND THE IMPACT IT IS HAVING ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. THANK YOU AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY TWO WILL ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO ENSURE EXPERTS STUDY ARE TO STUDY THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO WITHOUT I HAVE ONE WITNESS SO. THEY KNOW OUR KAISER WITH COMMONSENSE KITS. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL KAISER ON BEHALF OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION. COMMONSENSE SEEKS TO PROVIDE PARENTS AND EDUCATORS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE MEDIA THAT THEIR CHILDREN USE. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SUPPORTED IN AT INNOVATIVE RESEARCH INCLUDING REPORTS LIKE CENSUS ON MEDIA USE BY TWEENS AND TEENS. VIRTUAL REALITY ONE A ONE WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT KIDS AND BE OUR AND MOST RECENTLY TRUTH ABOUT TACK A ROAD MAP TO. A A ROADMAP FOR KIDS DIGITAL WELL BEING. HOWEVER IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION TO TAKE ON THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH RATHER WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE LONGITUDINAL LONGITUDINAL INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW THE UNSEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AYE AFFECTS OF MEDIA ARE AFFECTING OUR CHILDREN AS THEY CONSUME THOSE. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY TWO WOULD ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH ON DUTCH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF KITS. SUCH INFORMATION WILL HELP WILL HELP PARENTS EDUCATORS POLICYMAKERS AND THE TECH INDUSTRY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE INNOVATIONS ON TECHNOLOGY. ON CHU ON CHILDREN OF FAMILIES AND HOW TO MAXIMIZE THESE TOOLS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL. AS WE'RE LOOKING TO HOW OUR CHILDREN WILL MATURE INTO ADULTS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BETTER PLAN FOR THEM AS THEY GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE AND BEYOND. AS NATIONAL LEADERS IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION AND IT'S APPROPRIATE THE CALIFORNIA TAKE ON THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION THAT'S COMING TO OUR CHILDREN. WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TOPS ARE GOING. GOD. KEVIN MCKINLEY ON HALF THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION NO POSITION ON THE BILL WE COMMEND AUTHORS. GOALS WITH THE BILL AND WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE TWEAKS TO THE BILL. ABOUT WHAT EXPERTS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH. RIGHT TRIBAL CANTINA WORK WITH YOU THANKS ABSOLUTELY. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRIGADE BACK COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR MISTER KILEY. I'M SORRY TO MISS YOUR TEST MEANS TO SHARE JUST TAP COME BACK FROM HIS IN MY OWN DEL I. SO FORGIVE ME IF YOU COVERED THIS ALREADY I AM BUT I IS THIS AIMING TO HAVE. OUR STATE AGENCIES SORT OF. PROMPTS FRESH RESEARCH TO BE DONE OR IS THE PURPOSE TO. AG LATE IN THE ANALYZE EXISTING RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE AND THEN I YOU KNOW I'VE TRIED TO DRIVE INSIGHTS FOR. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC PUBLIC POLICY BUT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF OUR PLANNING AND. RESEARCH UP BASICALLY CONTACT AND CONTRACT WITH CONTRACT WITH OUR THIRD PARTIES FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCHER. EXPERTS TO CONDUCT OUR RESEARCH IN THIS BUT THE OTHER WEEK RECALL ISN'T WHETHER OR NOT THE USE. EXISTING STATISTICS ON SO YOU KNOW WHO THEY COULD BUILD ON WHAT'S OUT THERE ALREADY BUT ESSENTIALLY THIS IS YOU KNOW AN AREA THAT WE WANT TO CUT IT. KINDA UNTIL NEW LAUNCH BASICALLY. SO IT SEEMS TO ME OF THAT GOAL IS TO DO NEW RESEARCH MAYBE WE'RE NOT THE BEST AND THE DEED TO BE. YOU KNOW. MAKING THAT HAPPENED I I MEAN JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SITUATIONS YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THERE'S BEEN WORK DONE ALREADY SO. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO THAT WHATEVER PROFESSORS AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE DOING ON THIS IF WE COULD AGGREGATE WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND THEN SORT OF MAKE IT USEFUL FOR US THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DATE FUNCTION? NOW I'M GONNA ASK MY NGUYEN IS TO ADD TO THAT AGAIN THIS COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION HAS DONE A. QUITE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND PULLED ON RESEARCH THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING. THIS THIS RESEARCH HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN DONE SO WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING WHAT WE FEEL THAT THE BILL WOULD DO IS TO LOOK AT CURRENT RESEARCH EXPAND UPON NOT. AND LOOK AT THAT LONGITUDINAL DATA WE CAN'T JUST RELY ON DATA THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE. SO SHE IS TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPING KIDS ARE USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY MORE AND MORE OF IT. SO AGAIN NOT LONGITUDINAL DATA IS WHAT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT. YEAH. OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. I HAVE ONE A. MISTER CHOW I'M GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL A AND I AM. VERY THANKFUL THAT IN THE PREAMBLE YOU POINTED OUT THAT THE PURPOSE THE REPORT IS TO ADDRESS BOTH. NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES EXOTIC IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE UNBIASED AND NOT SEEK A A PREDETERMINED CONCLUSION WHEN WE ADDRESS REPORT LIKE THIS HOWEVER. IT IN THAT VEIN I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER PUTTING IN SOME ADDITIONAL TOPICS TO RESEARCH BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING INTO. PARKED IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IN A SENSE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO SINCE WE'RE IN FOR BEING UNBIASED WE ALSO NEED TO WEIGH THINGS LIKE. OF THE EFFECT OF INTERACTION WITH DIGITAL DEVICES AS CHILDREN ON LIFETIME EARNINGS ON PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY MAKE. AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT BOTH THE DANGERS AND THE ASSETS OF THAT TYPE OF INTERSECTION AS A CHILD. YES ACTUALLY THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION IN FACT OF THE LANGUAGE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THAT WE CAN STUDY BOTH THE POSITIVE NEGATIVE ROSE. ALL THAT'S IN THE SECTION SIX AYE VOTE FOR TO A FOUR ZERO POINT ONE SIX BE. SO WE WILL LOOK AT BOTH BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN AND ALSO LOOK AT. HERE IS THAT. YOU KNOW MAY NEED ME DEMAND MORE MORE RESEARCH I THOUGHT I SAW THAT IN THE THE LANGUAGE BUT THEN WHEN WE. WHEN WE ITEMIZE ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A REPORT IS GOING TO LOOK INTO TRAIN. I'M SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE WE ADD SOME AVENUES OF RESEARCH THAT COULD YIELD SOME POSITIVE DATA HERE INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON THE ONES THAT POTENTIAL YIELD NEGATIVE HERE JUST TO BE UNBIASED ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE IT JUST AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL. TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. RIGHT SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION BY SOME WOMEN CALDERON SECOND BY SOMEONE IN BERMAN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
