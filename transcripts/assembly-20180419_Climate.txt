GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HERE WITH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. MEMES EDUARDO GARCIA I'M THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THAT WE'LL GET STARTED DEL LASKAR. FIRST PANEL. TO COME UP BUBBA AMANDA MONACO LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IS A BIT ROADS LOS ANGELES COUNTY APARTMENT A PUBLIC CAL. LAWRENCE GOLD BAND WITH THE STEP DESCRIBING CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR JOINING US. I'D. TODAY'S HEARING ON BUILDING A HEALTHY AND RESILIENT TWO THOUSAND FIFTY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THESE IMPACTS WILL ONLY GET MORE EXTREME. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE THE SALTON SEA CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE FOR STATE. THAT IS RECEDING AND CAUSING SEVERE SOCIAL HOW. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THE SOONER WE IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. THE BETTER. TODAY'S HEARING IS BROKEN INTO TWO PANELS THE FIRST WHAT IS CURRENTLY. IS WHAT CURRENTLY THE CERTAIN. CONDITIONS AND AT WHAT IS BEING DONE ON THE GROUND. AND. THE SECOND IS ON ASSESSING THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THOSE. SITUATIONS. MY HOPE THAT WE LEAVE TODAY'S HEARING WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO ENSURE OUR COMMUNITIES. CAN ADAPT. AND THRIVE IN OUR STATE. IT WE GET TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTY. PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR AGAIN DEBT BEING HERE IN WILL JUMP RIGHT INTO THE FIRST A SPEAKER IN THE ORDER THAT WE CALL THEM UP. AMEND. WELCOME. I DIDN'T THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MY NAME IS AMANDA MONICA I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE ORGANIZATION CALLED LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITIES AFFECTED. BY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND ISKRATEL OF ALLEY. SO WE WORK ON A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES RANGING FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO AND. TED POLLUTION AND INDUSTRY CITING AND. DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER ISSUES. UP SO FIRST I'D LIKE. I'D LIKE TO KIND OF GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF GENERAL TRENDS REGARDING DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA'S BETTER. SO AS WE KNOW THERE ARE ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT ACCESS TO A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER TODAY AND THAT'S ONLY. ON ON PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING FOLKS ON DOMESTIC WELLS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. AND THERE AS AS AS WE KNOW THERE TWO SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER. SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER AND THE DROUGHT. HAS EXACERBATED OUR LACK OF ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER FROM BOTH SOURCES AND WE HAVE LESS REPORT RELIABLE SUPPLY AID TO TO OVER PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER IN LESS SURFACE WATER. ON. AND. AS A RESULT MORE CONCENTRATION OF CONTAMINANTS AS OFTEN AQUIFER IS OURS ARE DEPLETED. AND THIS LEADS TO AT THIS AND OTHER ISSUES LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OF WATER DUE TO LACK OF SUPPLY AND CONTAMINATION OF WATER. AND. SO THAT THE HISTORICAL KEPT THE CONTEXT IN THE CITY AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND OF DRINKING WATER AND CLAIM ISSUES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. IS THAT LAND USING GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT HAVE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ARM OR WATER RESOURCES OR CLIMATE CHANGE AND AS THEY SHOULD. SO WE HAVE DEPLETED GROUND WATER SUPPLIES AND FROM AN INCREASED FOCUS AS CONTINUED FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DRINKING WATER NEEDS AND WHAT. THAT VITAL WATER RESOURCES. AND NOW THAT LEADS TO A SITUATION WHERE MANY CITIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR LIMITED WATER CAPACITY THAT GIVES THEM LESS OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THEIR WATER SYSTEMS OUT TO CAN USE TO. LACK CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND. AND THERE HAS BEEN REALLY IN THE PAST VERY LITTLE CONTROLS ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING. AND ONLY A VOLUNTARY GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE IRWIN PROCESS. AND. AS NOTED BEFORE THE COMMUTE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE CONTINUALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE MUNICIPAL DRINKING WATER SERVICES. AND I'D LIKE TO KIND OF BRING THIS DOWN TO A LEVEL OF COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH THAT I WORKED DIRECTLY WITH IN THE COUNTY OF. FRESNO AND FIRST TOMBSTONE TERRITORY. IS A COMMUNITY JUST SOUTH OF THE CITY OF SAYING. A THEY ARE ON DOMESTIC WELLS AND THEIR DOMESTIC WELLS ARE CONTAMINATED WITH NITRATES AND ONE TWO THREE TCP IT AS WELL AS BACK TO CHLOROFORM BACTERIA. AND MANY OF THEIR HOMES HAVE ACTUALLY. UNFORTUNATELY LACKED A ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER SOAKED THEIR WEALTH OF GONE DRIVE. CONSISTENTLY OVER THE LAST. THREE OUR YEARS AND MANY FOLKS HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COMMUNITIES AND MANY HAVE HAD TO GET WATER FROM HOSES FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS. AND. SINCE THERE IS A LIMITED GROUND WATER SUPPLY IN THE VALLEY OF THE NEIGHBORING CITY OF SANGER IS VERY HESITANT TO EXTEND THEIR WATER SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED WATER CAPACITY. THEN ANOTHER COMMUNITY CALLED COME TO A CREEK. AND AND IT'S NEARING ITS NEIGHBORS AND AND PUT AN EVEN ARE ALSO ON A THEY'RE ON A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. THAT ACTUALLY RECEIVES THEIR SOURCE OF WATER FROM THEM WHAT FUNDS WATER DISTRICT AT THROUGH THEIR SURFACE WATER CANALS. AND DUE TO THE DROUGHT AND DUE TO FLATTEN THAT DO THE DROUGHT THERE'S BEEN MANY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF WATER. LEADING TO SOME FAMILIES HAVING TO PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THEIR WATER BILLS. AND IN TWENTY TEN THEIR BILLS INCREASED DRASTICALLY AND THEY COULDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS THE COUNTY OF FRESNO ACTUALLY AND. THAT THREATENED TO CUT OFF THEIR WATER SUPPLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PAY THEIR THEIR WATER BILLS AND THEN THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY WAS ABLE TO INTERVENE. GAVE THE COMMUNITY A GRANT AND THE COUNTY STARTED LOOKING INTO DEVELOPING A NEW GROUND WATER WATER SYSTEM WHICH LATER I'LL GET INTO SOME COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT COME FROM THAT. SO THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE SEE GIVEN THE PROBLEMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED SO FAR ARE FIVE. ONE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. WE KNOW THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OVER GROUNDWATER PUMPING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE REALLY KNOW THAT WE NEED TO. TO SCALE IT BACK AND LOOK AT OUR OUR WATER SUPPLY AND HOW WE CAN AND IS THAT BETTER. ALSO ACT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SIGMA. AND GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN DEVELOPMENT. WE NEED TO ENSURE AS A STATE BUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NEEDS ARE TAKEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT OUT OF MUNICIPAL DRINKING WATER SERVICES. AND THEY'RE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET BY SUSTAINABILITY COUNTY SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. BUT THERE'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT THEY WON'T BE. IMPACTED BY CLIMATE IN THE FUTURE. SECOND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WERE INCORPORATING PLANNING FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND CLIMB ADAPTATION AND WATER PLANNING INTO LOCAL AND REGIONAL. PLANNING FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH GENERAL PLANS A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS AND LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION COMMISSION POLICY IS. WHEN THEY ACT TO MODIFY LOCAL DISTRICT OR CITY BOUNDARY IS. THESE PLANTS IN ADDITION MUST COORDINATE WITH. GROUND OR TO SING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY PLANS IN ORDER AND TO ENSURE. THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WON'T BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE SO AFFECT ON THEIR WATER SUPPLY. A THIRD. WE NEED TO ENSURE AS A STATE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE. ACTION TAKEN TO CONSOLIDATE SMALL COMMUNITY SMALL DISADVANTAGED WE WATER SYSTEMS INTO LARGER WATER SYSTEMS AND. THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN EXPANSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES WERE ON DOMESTIC WELLS IN OUR LOW INCOME AND I AM ABLE TO. RUN. ADDRESS THEIR. WATER CONTAMINATION ISSUES AND WATER SUPPLY ISSUES IN THERE ON INCOME FROM THEIR WELLS. FOURTH IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE AND IS ABLE TO BE. OPERATED IN THE LONG TERM ISN'T SUBJECT TO. CLIMATE VULNERABILITY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR WATER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. AND FIFTH GENERALLY AS WE GO FORWARD IN MAKING POLICY AND PLANNING DECISIONS. AT A LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT DEMOCRATIC IT WOULD TO AND THAT WE DEMOCRATIZE DECISION MAKING AND ALL OF THE SPACES ENSURING THAT. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NEEDS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND WHEN THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR MOST ROLE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS FOR THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON WATER SUPPLY. AND. SO JUST TO WRAP UP SOME BRIGHT SPOTS SOME SPIKE SPOTS OF HOPE. ON OUR THAT INCOME TO A CREEK. AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THEIR SURFACE WATER SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE FOR THEM AND SUBJECT TO. FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE BECAUSE OF DROUGHT THEIR TRANSITIONING TO A GROUND WATER SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD HAVE A MORE SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF WATER. IF THE GROUNDWATER IS MANAGED SUSTAINABLY THEIR NEEDS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND. TWO IN TOMBSTONE TERRITORY SHANKER IS CONSIDERING EXTENDING THEIR WATER SYSTEM OUT TO TOMBSTONE TERRITORY GIVEN AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS SUIT THAT A DIVISION OF. OF WATER RESOURCES. HOWEVER. THAT'S IT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT SO THAT. THE SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE. I. SO THOSE ARE SOME SOME INSIGHT THAT SOME INSIGHT FROM MY WORK ON IN FRESNO COUNTY AND ARTWORK IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY NEWS COACHELLA VALLEY ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON WATER SUPPLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND AND I'M OF COURSE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMEND WILL LOOK MOVE ONTO THE NEXT STEP PRESENTER ELIZABETH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE AND. FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AND THE BURGEONING CRITICAL NEED TO ADDRESS THEM. SO I'M I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND MY RESEARCH BACKGROUND IS IN THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND IN MY CURRENT ROLE. AYE AYE PROVIDE A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTY. AT PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS BRING CLIMATE CHANGE CONSIDERATIONS INTO PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN BASS PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I AM AND I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH THE FOCUS ON EXTREME HEAT. AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS AND OUR WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I WANTED TO START OUT WITH A FEW POINTS ON WHY PUBLIC HEALTH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN CLIMATE CHANGE WORK. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGES ALL DESCRIBED. AND AND ALSO RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE IT SO THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IT. AND CONCERN OVER HEALTH IS UNIVERSAL AND IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL. AND OFTENTIMES CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE PAST HAS HAS BEEN PORTRAYED AS RELATING TO YOU ICE CAPS AND SAT AND POLAR BEARS AND. THOSE WALL SAT AREN'T IN MEDIA AND PERSONAL TO MOST PEOPLE ON HEALTH IS BOTH IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL. ANOTHER REASON AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT I IN THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTIONS BRING ABOUT POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS. AND SO CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ARE AT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY TO CREATE A HEALTHIER MORE RESILIENT AND MORE EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES. SO BROADLY IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION OUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE'RE EXPECTING INCLUDE HOTTER TEMPERATURES. WORST AIR QUALITY AND MORE ACRES BURNED BY WILDFIRES MORE FLOODING AND WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND VECTOR BORNE DISEASE. HAS ASKED TO FOCUS ON EXTREME HEAT AS AN EXAMPLE. AND WE'RE EXPECTING THE NUMBER OF EXTREME HEAT DAYS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO INCREASE BY ABOUT TWO TO FOUR TIMES BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY. THOSE ARE DEFINED AS STAYS OVER NINETY FIVE DEGREES SO WE'LL SEE TWO TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY DAYS OVER NINETY FIVE DEGREES. BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY AS WE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE. AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN BECAUSE EXTREME HEAT OF FUNDS ALREADY IN THE U. S. CAUSE MORE DEATHS EACH YEAR THAN FLOODS STORMS AND LIGHTNING COMBINES. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIA HAD A HEAT WAVE THAT LED TO OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEATHS. AND AND BECAUSE HE ALSO PLACES STRESS ON THE BODY IT EXACERBATES EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. AYE RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES SO WE TYPICALLY SEE MORE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS DURING EXTREME HEAT OF FANS. AND DURING CALIFORNIA'S TWO THOUSAND SIX HEATWAVE WE SAW MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACCESS EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS ACROSS THE STATE. MORE THAN A THOUSAND ACCESS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION AND HEALTH RELATED COSTS. WE ALSO I HAVE NOTED AT THAT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE SEEING AND NON FATAL EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS FOR HEAT RELATED ILLNESS. INCREASING NOT SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE. AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROJECTS I HEAT RELATED ILLNESS IMPACTS FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS. A PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO AIR CONDITIONING ACCLIMATISATION ABOUT RESEARCH IT CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT WELL THAT WE'LL BE SEEING MORE HE RELATED ILLNESSES AND DEATHS IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND AS YOU KNOW AND MANY PARTS OF LOS ANGELES AND CALIFORNIA OVERALL OUR HEAVILY URBANIZED AND THESE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WITH. YOU KNOW PAVED SURFACES LIKE GROUPS AND SOME AND PAVEMENTS AND. AND LAST TREE CANOPY LAST GREEN SPACE CRATE AND URBAN HEAT ISLANDS THAT LEADS TO TEMPERATURES IN CITIES THAT ARE ABOUT FIVE DEGREES HOTTER DURING THE DAYTIME THAN SURROUNDING RURAL AREAS. AND EVEN HOTTER AT NIGHTS AND THAT THIS URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT ACTUALLY MAGNIFIES I DURING. DURING HEAT WAVES AND DUE TO THEN THAT'S URBAN HEAT ISLAND A FACTS PEOPLE LIVING IN AREAS THAT HAVE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF PAVED. SURFACES AND LOW TREE CANOPY ARE BASICALLY SUFFERING FROM. ARTIFICIALLY HOTTER TEMPERATURES AND BECAUSE OF THIS BELT ENVIRONMENTS. I IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE ONLY ABOUT HALF OF OUR HOMES HAVE A CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING SO MANY OF THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIVING IN URBAN HEAT ISLANDS. I WOULD ALSO LACKEY AIR CONDITIONING. EXTREME HEAT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HEAT RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATH NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT EXACERBATES EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES TO OTHER AND NEGATIVE HEALTH RELATED IMPACTS SO. STREAM HEAT INCREASES THE CONCENTRATIONS OF GROUND LEVEL OZONE WHICH IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF SMOG THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH POOR RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES. SO EXTREME HEAT CONTRIBUTES TO DECLINING AIR QUALITY. AND EXTREME HE COMBINED WITH DROUGHT ALSO DECREASE SOIL MOISTURE INCREASED CLAMOR PTOLEMY AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TO LARGER WILD FIRES WHICH IN TURN FURTHER DID AND DETERIORATE OUR AIR QUALITY. OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT UP LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF EXTREME HEAT PAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN URBAN HEAT ISLANDS THAT EXPERIENCE HOTTER TEMPERATURES. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PRE EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM SENSITIVE TO HEAT I LIKE DIABETES. AND THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. TO ADAPT TO EXTREME HEAT OF FANS AND THAT THESE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THAT ARE FACED BY A LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE GOING TO FURTHER. FURTHER WHITE AND EXISTING HEALTH AND OTHER DISPARITIES. SO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING AND THE PUBLIC FROM THE HEALTH IMPACTS IT HEATS. UP SOME OF THE THINGS WE ALREADY DO AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE WE ISSUE HE'D ALERTS ADVISORIES AND EMERGENCIES. WE CONVENE OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS DURING A HEAT WAVE AND TO ORGANIZE THE OPENING OF COOLING CENTERS AND WE DISTRIBUTE PUBLIC INFORMATION. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT UP THAT HE NEEDS TO BE TACKLED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS IN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING MORE EXTREME HEAT LEAN INTO. CONTINUE TO DO MORE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND SO I DISCUSS THE FACT THAT THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND IS ARTIFICIALLY INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND CITIES. SO ONE THING THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN DOING IS WORKING WITH OUR FELLOW COUNTY DEPARTMENTS LIKE PUBLIC WORKS AND REGIONAL PLANNING. AND PARKS AND RECREATION ON AN URBAN HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION PLAN. AND FATS HAS VARIOUS ACTION ITEMS THAT HELP REDUCE THE URBAN HEAT ISLANDS OF FACTS AND ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THIS PLAN IS COMPOSED OF FOUR STRATEGIES. SO COOL ROOFS QUAN PAVEMENTS TREES AND GREEN SPACE. WHEN URBAN HEAT ISLAND IT ACTION IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STRATEGY THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT'S AN UPS SORT OF AN UPSTREAM BUILT ENVIRONMENT SOLUTION THAT HELPS PROMOTE EQUITY FOR EXAMPLE BY. INCREASING TREE CANOPY AND AND I COMMUNITIES THAT THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TREE CANOPY AND GREEN SPACE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ON THE LANCET COMMISSION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH CALLS AND NO REGRET. OPTION THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY TO CREATE A HEALTHIER MORE RESILIENT AND MORE EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I WE HAS A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON INTO IN TERMS OF TACKLING EXTREME HEAT URBAN HEAT ISLAND ACTION WILL HELP COOLER NEIGHBORHOODS. SHALL HELP UP LASSEN THAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS FROM HEATS HELP REDUCE ENERGY USAGE AND HOPEFULLY OFFSET SOME OF THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES THAT WERE EXPECTING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN PLAY MANY ROLES IN CLIMATE CHANGE. AND OR AND GENERALLY AMONG OTHER THINGS WE TRACTATE DATA ON DISEASE OCCURRENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WE PROVIDE RISK ASSESSMENTS. WHERE A TRUSTED SOURCE OF HEALTH INFORMATION SO WE INFORM EDUCATE AND EMPOWER COMMUNITIES AND DECISION MAKERS? WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A CONVENE AND FACILITATOR LIKE WE'RE DOING WITH THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION. SO WHAT OTHER CAN I GOVERNMENT AGENCIES NON PROFITS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SAP PLANS FOR RESPONDING TO HEALTH THREATS WE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS FELLOW AND IMPLEMENT. POLICIES THAT PROTECT AND PROMOTE HEALTH WE WORK A LOT WITH PARTNERS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY BUILT ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE ACTIVE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND WE IMPLEMENT TERRAX INTERVENTIONS TO RESPOND TO HEALTH THREATS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE TRUSTED AND WE'RE REALLY ON THE FRONT LINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR WELL SITUATED TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN MITIGATING AND ADAPTING. AT TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN WAYS THAT PROMOTE RESILIENCE AND HEALTH UP BUT IN MANY CASES LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY STAFFED AND RESORTS. AND TO UNDERTAKE THESE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE DONE AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC OR NEED TO BE EXPANDED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. AND CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO TRACK DATA ON CLIMATE RELATED INDICATORS HAVE BOTH RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTS AND DISEASE INCIDENCE. WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY FOR MODELING AND FORECASTING HEALTH IMPACTS AND THEN. UP PLANNING FOR THOSE IMPACTS. GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE NEED TO COPE WITH EXTREME HEAT AND THEN IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THAT ASSISTS PEOPLE IN COPING WITH EXTREME HEATS. WE WANT TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND REACH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH MESSAGING AND CONDUCT MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS. WE WANT TO TRAIN PHYSICIANS ON HOW TO SPEAK TO THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IMPROVE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLANS FOR CLIMATE IMPACTS. I CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT ON A LARGER SCALE AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT SOLUTIONS LIKE URBAN HEAT ISLAND ACTION. AND REALLY PROMOTE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFER CLAIMANT LETTER IT AND ARE TRAINED. AND TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO CLIMATE CHANGE PRESENTS YOU KNOW SO MANY THREATS AND CHALLENGES VOTE WE BELIEVE IT ALSO PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES. OPPORTUNITIES SAID TRANSFORM COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE BELTS ENVIRONMENTS. TO IMPROVE OUR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND TO INCREASE OUR MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS. AND SO THE ISRAELI ARE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND TO IMPLEMENT THOSE NO REGRETS OPTIONS THAT CREATE HEALTHIER MORE RESILIENT AND MORE EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES. COME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. BUT I WANT TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION MY NAME IS LARRY GOLD SPAN I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION WHICH BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS THE STATE AGENCY. ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OLD AND WE WERE CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TO THE MAC AT YOUR PETROUS ACT. AND DC DC IS THE NATION'S OLDEST COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT AGENCY. ACTUALLY DEVELOPED TO SUCH DUE TO THE FILLING OF THE BAY AND THE DUMPING ALONG THE BAY AND WITH NINE COUNTIES IN FORTY ONE CITIES EACH HAVING THEIR OWN LITTLE FIEFDOMS IT WAS DECIDED BY THE STATE THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE A. COALESCING AROUND ONE TYPE OF AUTHORITY AND THAT'S HOW THE CDC CREATED. OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY IS PRODUCTIVE IN ALL RESPECTS ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. IT HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF SHORELINE IS ACTUALLY LARGER THAN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ITSELF. BUT IT'S ALSO VERY SHALLOW AND IS SURROUNDED BY HILLS SO FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF HOW WATER WORKS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN HERE. IT'S REALLY JUST A BIG BATHTUB WHICH CAN OVERFLOW PRETTY EASILY. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT WE THINK ABOUT IS FLOODING JUST LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT HEAT AND YOU THINK ABOUT WATER WE THINK ABOUT WATER COMING INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES. INTO PEOPLE'S BUSINESSES PLACES OF WORSHIP AND THE LIKE. AND THAT FLOODING IS EXACERBATED BY RISING SEA LEVEL IN ADDITION TO THAT WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE STORMS TIDES KING TIDES AND THE LIKE. SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCIENCE IN THE SCIENCE AS WELL. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY LATEST REPORT. WE BASICALLY NEED THE PLAN FOR TWO FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL IN THE BAY BY TWENTY FIFTY. AND FOUR FEET BY THE END OF THE CENTURY ALTHOUGH IT CERTAINLY CAN GO HIGHER DEPENDING UPON HOW THE ICE SHEETS ACTUALLY WORK. AND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT ARE PRETTY DRASTIC. I WOULD URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK IN YOUR LITTLE BLUE FOLDER. ONE PAGE AT A TIME IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE TEST THAT YOU TOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO FREE THAT LED TO GO AHEAD. THIS IS A VERY BASIC MAP OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF THE BAY WERE ALL OF A SUDDEN TWO FEET HIGHER. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF BLUE AN AWFUL LOT OF GREEN AROUND THE BAY WHICH IS NOW DRY. AND THIS IS ON A PRETTY SUNNY BEAUTIFUL WINDLESS DAY WITHOUT A HIGH TIDE THAT IS A KING TIED. AND THE KEY HERE IS THAT SCORES OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP IN HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS. ARE GOING TO BE HIT BY FLOODS. AND FLOODING IS NOT SIMPLY A NUISANCE. FLOODING HAS TREMENDOUS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS IT HAS TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISLOCATION IMPLICATIONS. SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE NINE COUNTIES IN FORTY ONE CITIES LED BY BC DC BECOME MORE RESILIENT SO THAT THEIR PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BECOME MORE RECENTLY. AND TO PUT AN EVEN FINER POINT ON IT. WHILE MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO BAY NOW AND ADMIRE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS WHEN BC DC WAS CREATED THE BAY WAS NOT EVERYBODY'S FRONT YARD. HE WAS EVERYBODY'S BACKYARD PEOPLE DUMPED IN THE BAY. THERE IT THERE ARE ARE JUST AND LARGE NUMBER OF DUMPS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN CAPPED WHICH MEANS THAT IS FLAT MORE AND MORE FLOODING OCCURS SLOWLY MORE AND MORE HEALTH RISKS. SO WATER BE CDCS TASKS WELL WE'RE HERE TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS REDUCE THAT RISK OF FLOODING THROUGH BOTH PLANNING AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BAY AND WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE. SO THERE THREE ON THE GROUND WAYS IN WHICH BE CDC IS HELPING THE FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA. THE FIRST THIS THROUGH PLANNING ARE ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES PROGRAM WHICH IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PROGRAM OF PLANNING WHICH PUTS PEOPLE FIRST. NOT HIGHWAYS. NOT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS BUT ACTUALLY PEOPLE AND WE WORK WITHIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO THEM TO REDUCE THEIR RISK OF FLOODING. AND THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPED FUND BY CALTRANS AND THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. BECAUSE CALTRANS RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S HIGHWAYS AS LONG WITH BART'S IN ALL THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS AND THE PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT AREAS IN THE COMMUNITIES AT RISK. MANY OF WHICH ARE LOW INCOME MANY OF WHICH ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NEED THE ASSISTANCE. SO THERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES IF YOU LOOK AT THE SECOND PAGE YOU'LL SEE A BRIDGE THAT LOOKS PRETTY OLD. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BRIDGE RIGHT BEHIND EIGHTEEN T. BALLPARK THAT'S THE LEFTY O. DUAL BRIDGE WHICH IS YOU CAN SEE ON. A BASIC NICE DAY IS NOT THAT FAR ABOVE WHERE THE WATER HITS. SO IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS IN TWENTY FIFTY WITH YOU HAVE TO FOUR FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL PLUS A STORM. PLUS A KING TIED WHICH IS GOING TO RAISE WHICH IS GOING TO RAISE THE HIGH TIDE EN EL NINO WHICH CAN RAISE THE ELEVATION OF THE BAY BY AS MUCH AS TWO FEET. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT PICTURE THAT'S HAYWARD RIGHT NEXT TO THE DUMBARTON BRIDGE APPROACH ON THE BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS CLEAR BLUE SKY DAY AND IT'S FLOODED. THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT FOUR SLIDES WHICH ARE ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE IN WILL MOURN HAPPY TO TALK TO STAFF IN YOU AND WHOEVER ABOUT IT. ABOUT HOW HE WOULD RESIDENTS USING BC DC IN OUR APPROACH WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT FOR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO MAKE HAY WORD RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS FAR MORE RESILIENT EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE SLIDE YOU JUST SAW. SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDE IT'S SIMPLY A DESCRIPTION OF THE ART BAY AREA PROJECT WITH CALTRANS THE MTC THE FIRST EVER VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE BAY AREA WITH REGARD TO ACTUAL RISING SEA. AND IT'S IT WILL HAVE THAT COMPLETED NEXT JUNE AND THAT WILL BECOME THE BASIS OF THE NEXUS STABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY AS WELL. TO ENSURE THAT THAT THEN GETS PUT INTO THE INTO THE STRATEGY HOW DO WE BECOME MORE RESILIENT. THE SECOND WAY WE HELP IS TO PERMITTING. WE ACTUALLY PERMIT NEW STRUCTURES. THE CDC ISN'T AFRAID TO PERMIT NEW STRUCTURES BECAUSE WE WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE RESILIENT TO SEA LEVEL RISE. AND WE MAKE SURE. THAT WE BUT PROVE BOTH HARDSCAPE WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS SAY BUILDINGS AND THE LIKE AND WALLS. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT MARSHLAND ENTRY AND WETLANDS BECAUSE THOSE PROVIDE A SPONGE AFFECT ESPECIALLY IN THE SHALLOWER AREAS WHICH CAN REDUCE FLOODING AND ALSO CREATE HABITAT. AND MOST IMPORTANT WE'RE LEARNING WITH THE PERMIT APPLICANTS HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ADAPT TO THOSE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. WE CAN SAY TO FEET BY TWENTY FIFTY BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE TWO FEET BY TWENTY FIFTH YEAR FOUR FEET BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. IT COULD BE MORE IT COULD BE LESS WHICH MEANS THAT WE REQUIRED THOSE PERMIT APPLICANTS TO HAVE AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO THAT THEY CAN QUICKLY ADAPT A CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCE. AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WERE WORKING WITH. THE PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY LOOK INTERNAL TO BE CDC AND CHANGE OUR OWN POLICIES AND DO IT TRANSPARENTLY WITH WORKSHOPS AND WITH PUBLIC INPUT. TO THE WAY TO IN THE TO THE ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH ARE THE NEXT TWO PAGES. THE FIRST IS PHIL BC DC WAS CREATED TO REDUCE THE FILL IN THE BAY MAKE THE BAY BIGGER. BUT IF WE WANT TO IF WE WANT TO BOLSTER CREATE AND PROTECT WETLANDS. WE HAVE TO PUT. IN THE BANG WE HAVE TO CREATE THE WETLANDS SO HOW DO WE CHANGE OUR HOW DO WE CHANGE OUR PROCESS IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT DIRT. AND DIRT IN THE BAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND THE WETLANDS TO VERY TECHNICAL ISSUE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND WE'RE DOING A PRETTY WELL WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSED AND AND DEBATED IN DONE WITHIN. EIGHT EIGHT TO NINE MONTHS. SECOND WERE ALSO LOOKING COURSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL EQUITY BECAUSE AS I SAID SO MUCH OF THE BAYS SHORELINE WHICH HAVE RESIDENTS ON IT ARE IN PLACES LIKE THE CANAL DISTRICT IN SANDRA FELL. BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT SAN FRAN. EAST PALO ALTO AL WEISEL. WEST OAKLAND AND GOING UP TO RICHMOND. VERY VERY DIFFICULT PLACES IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE AND LIVE WITH FAMILIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE AREAS ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. JUST LIKE THEY WERE IN MANY WERE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND TIMES IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY SOLUTION FOR THE BAY WORKS FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST SOME PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHAT WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IS TO CHANGE NEAR TERM AND THIS IS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE'RE SMALL STATE AGENCY WHERE FORTY PEOPLE BUDGETS LESS THAN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS I WAS JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS MORNING WORKING WITH THEM. AND THEY UNDERSTAND THESE KINDS OF CHALLENGES SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO HOW BE CDC WORKS. JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THAT HOWEVER WHERE THE GTR A FUNDS THAT YOU ALL SUPPLIED FOR ADAPTATION FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS PAST YEAR. WERE THE RECIPIENT OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF THE STATE BUDGET BUT IT'S A LOT TO BE CDC. AND ENABLES US TO WORK EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE KINDS OF NEIGHBORHOODS. AND OF COURSE THOSE FUNDS ALSO WANTS THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN THE COSTA CONSERVANCY WHICH MAKE GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO WORK ON THEIR OWN. AND WORK WITH US. SO WHAT'S TO KEEP MOST UPPERMOST IN MINE. WE NEED TO HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT PROTECT WHOLE COMMUNITIES FROM FLOODING. AND FROM INUNDATION BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE COMMON WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS CAN KEEP HOLE IN THE NEAR TERM. YOU CAN'T HAVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISLOCATION BECAUSE THAT DISRUPTS EVERYTHING. AND AS SANDY KIND OF STORM WHICH WE HAVEN'T HAD YET COULD CAUSE UP TO SAY TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC DAMAGE TO THE BAY AREA ACCORDING TO THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. AND SO WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT TYPE OF OCCURRENCE FLOODING HAPPENS NOW SO LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST THREE SLIDES AND I'LL SHOW YOU. THE FIRST IS AND YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT BEHIND YOU. THE SAN FRANCISCO EMBARCADERO. THAT'S THE BAY BRIDGE RIGHT BEHIND THAT TO THE KING TIED. THAT HAPPENS TWICE A YEAR NOW. ON A CLEAR DAY NOT ON A STORMY DAY. THE NEXT PICTURE SOUTHERN MARIN. THAT'S HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE ABOVE THAT WHERE YOU SEE THE BUS. RIGHT BELOW IT IS THE ON RAMP AN OFF RAMP MONEY. TIED BEAUTIFUL DAY IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY THE FLOODING OCCURS ALREADY. AND THEN FINALLY THE NEXT YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE FLOODING OF STATE HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN WHICH CONNECTS FOR COUNTIES IN NORTH BAY AREA. THIS IS AN INTERSECTION JUST AFTER THAT FLOODING. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WE CAN DISRUPT GOODS AND JUST AS IMPORTANT PEOPLE MOVEMENT. SO THAT WAS OF THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT WERE DEALING WITH AND WE'RE SOLVING WITH OUR PARTNERS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO ALL THREE OF YOU THERE. I THINK HAS BEEN A PRESENTATION THAT. ADDRESSES SOME OF THE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS A STATE AGENCY. WHAT IS BEING DONE AND REGION AND THEN OF COURSE THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I? GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE. IF WE COULD BEGIN TO MAYBE FILL IN SOME GAPS. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE AREAS RIGHT THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO LOOK AT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL. THAT ALLOW US TO BEGIN TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS KEEPING IN MIND WITH. I THINK ALL OF YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON. THESE UP COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY CLAIMING THAT CHANGE AND SO WE CAN GO DOWN. THE PANELIST AS HE PRESENTED TO JUST KIND OF REYES PROFOUND SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO. FILL IN GAPS ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS. OOPS. IS THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THE QUESTION RIGHT. IS HERE ARE YOU WANTS TO KNOW KIND OF FROM A STATE LEVEL HOW YOU CAN CONNECT. WATER ISSUES ACROSS CALIFORNIA OR BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENCE I THINK BETWEEN BETWEEN THE KIND OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT RIGHT. THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD BACK TO THE POPULATIONS THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON. WHETHER BE IN THE EASTERN PECHELL VALUE OR CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK. AS I MENTIONED. I'VE. AT LEAST REGARDING WATER SUPPLY ACROSS THE STATE I DO THINK THAT. OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE THAT. I ENTIRE STATE COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO ADDRESS WATER SUPPLY IS REALLY NECESSARY AND THAT SPANS ALL THE SOLUTIONS THAT I SPOKE ABOUT. FROM LOCAL GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT TO ENSURING THAT THERE'S A STATE FUND FOR INSURING FOR. ESTABLISHING A RELIABLE DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND THEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE PLANNING THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CLIMATE CHANGE WATER SUPPLY ESPECIALLY FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE AT LOW INCOME AND. COMMITTEES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO WE KNOW THERE'S A AN EFFORT UNDER WAY. A CONVERSATION THAT THERE'S ALSO MADE IT TO. AND THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND AND NOW INCORPORATED INTO A BUDGET. CONVERSATION ABOUT THEY FUND RIGHT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AREAS THAT MANY OF SAID THAT THAT. CERTAINLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ALPHA THESE REGIONS THAT. FUNDS ONLY ONLY TOUCHES JUST A TINY BIT BUT WE KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE ON A RECURRING BASIS. THAT THAT FUND COULD POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE. I GUESS SOME WHAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING AS. YOU KNOW BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. DURING MY TENURE THERE TO UPDATE THE GENERAL PLAN. AND INCORPORATE YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH ELEMENTS. TO THE GENERAL PLAN WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO INCORPORATE CLIMATE CHANGE. ADAPTATION PLANS. THERE'S A CONVERSATION OF INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. ELEMENTS TO THE PLAN I MEAN WHAT DO YOU SEE. THOSE EFFORTS. ULTIMATELY PRODUCING AND WHETHER OR NOT AT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL ONE THING AS SAYING HERE WE HAVE THIS PLAN THAT'S IN CORPORATE JOB PLAN. THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY AT BEING CARRIED OUT. IN NO. COLLECTIVELY BY OUR LOCAL LEADERS AND DO YOU SEE BABY. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LOS ANGELES. AREA. CHALLENGES OPPORTUNITIES I COME THAT IF YOU CAN COMMENT JUST ADD TO THAT. CONVERSATION ABSOLUTELY AT TO KIND OF ADDRESS THAT THE GAPS AND THEN AND THAT'S. I'M ISSUE I THINK. I. THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE SO MUCH SOME POTENTIAL FOR HOW THEY CAN. ENGAGE AND THAT ARE REALLY LIMITED AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF OF STAFF AND RESOURCES. AND AND SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE BIG GAPS AND IT IT MEANS THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF THE BANDWIDTH TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS. AND AND THEN SAID. TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT KIND OF DOING A BETTER JOB OF ENGAGING. COMMUNITIES AND WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIE TO IMPLEMENT ON SOME OF THESE PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES. HAVING NOT HAVING. KIND OF AT THE MOMENT. LOCAL A LOT OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THAT'S THE STAFF CAPACITY AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE. TO TO KIND OF DO THAT SO AT WITH MORE CAPACITY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BE INVOLVED IN MORE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. BUT pALSO TO REALLY DO MEANINGFUL LIKE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES TRAINING THIS IS SO CRITICAL TO SEE THOSE PLANS I'M KIND OF. CARRIED OUT. THANK YOU PROJECT ADD FOR IT BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL SORT OF SAYING THE SAME THING FROM SORT OF TEN DEGREES OFF BECAUSE WE ALL WORK WITH LOCAL. PLANNERS AND WE ALL WORK WITH LOCAL. COMMUNITY GROUPS WELL LOOK WORK WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE CANDIDLY AND YOU COME FROM THAT WORLD THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD. AND I THINK THAT IN MANY RESPECTS WHAT THE CDC DOES AS A STATE AGENCY CAN BE A MODEL. AND HOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY CAN BE A MODEL BECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE NINE COUNTIES AND FORTY ONE CITIES. AND THEY COULD EACH HAVE THEIR OWN POLICIES. IN IT AND THEY DO. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS THAT A. AND IS IS A FLOODING POLICY A RESILIENCE POLICY FOR ONE COUNTY DOESN'T ADVERSELY AFFECT ANOTHER COUNTY BY CAUSING MORE FLOODING OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAY FOR EXAMPLE. SO WHAT WE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IN IN IN IN OUR SET UP. REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES AND WE WORK ON A CONSENSUS BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT THE BAY AS A WHOLE. AND AS WE PLAN WE BRING IN THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS AND TEACH THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS HOW TO THINK ABOUT NOT ONLY THEIR WORK UT HOW THEIR WORK AFFECTS THE FOLKS NEXT DOOR. AND AS WE PERMIT WE WORK WITH THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY DO ALSO ENSURE SOME LEVEL A PAVE VERY LARGE REVOLUTE A LEVEL OF RESILIENCE AS WELL. SO IT COMES DOWN TO ACTUALLY WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE A POSITIVE ROLE TO PLAY AND THE SHOULDN'T BE SCARED ABOUT. THE HEAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE SCARED ABOUT THE WATER AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN ALL FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT BETTER. AND ALL THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE POLLYANNA ASH BUT FROM A PLANNERS PERSPECTIVE AND I'M NOT A PLANNER BUT FROM A PLANNERS PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S HOW YOU GET SOME KIND OF POSITIVE CHANGE. THANK YOU I THINK I'M YOU CAN SHED LIGHT TO I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF. AND THE ROLE THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES PLAY. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE CLOSING. COMMENT ABOUT PLANNING I THINK MUCH OF IT. REALLY BOILS DOWN TO. YOU KNOW THE PLANNING. OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THERE ARE SOME. LOCATIONS THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE I CAN SPEAK FOR THE REGION THAT I REPRESENT THAT IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE. TO SEE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN THOSE AREAS AND YOU HAVE THESE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES. AND GET AHEAD OF MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CAUSING SOME CHALLENGES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU SHEDDING LIGHT ON THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO. JUST MAYBE CLOSE. AND THIS PANEL BY ADDING YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT THAT US HERE AT THE STATE POLICY LEVEL. ASIDE FROM THE NEED FOR. BUILDING GREATER CAPACITY IN. OF COURSE THE INVESTMENT INTO WELL I'M. AND THE RESOURCES NEEDED ARE THERE SOME POLICIES THAT THAT YOU THINK. THE STATE COULD ADAPT. OR ADOPT AND. WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL PARTNERS. TO HELP CARRY OUT SOME OF THESE OBJECTIVES. SURE I'LL GO FIRST. OF A SO I. AND. TO KIND OF ADD ON TO THE LAST COMMENTS ABOUT LOCAL PLANNING I THINK. YOU NO TAXES THAT IN ADDITION TO MORE FUNDING FOR RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WATER SUPPLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND MORE EFFECTIVE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. JUST WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE. PLANNING FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL WITHSTAND KLEIN CLIMATE IMPACTS. AS OF NOW THEY'RE THE MOST VULNERABLE UNTIL TERMS OF HEALTH BACK IMPACTS FROM PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING BUT IF YOU ADD ON TO THAT OUR FUTURE ROOF CLIMATE. VARIABILITY THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN. MORE EGREGIOUSLY IMPACTING AND EQUITABLY IMPACTING THIS THAT YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO WORK ALONGSIDE AT. WORK ALONGSIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO. FURTHER DEVELOP THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN SET OUT AND SP TWO FORTY FOUR SP ONE THOUSAND. WHERE? GENERAL PLANS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING DOES NEED TO TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS INTO ACCOUNT. AND PLAN FOR ALLEN HOW IT WILL GET EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHAT WATER WASTE WATERS. STORM WATER PROTECTION FIRE PROTECTION. AND AND FURTHER. FURTHER DEVELOP THAT AS FAR INSOFAR AS IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CLIMATE THAT ADAPTATION. THANK YOU. I THINK I'M AS AS WE WORK AND I WOULD ECHO AMANDA SUGGESTIONS AROUND KIND OF. INCREASING CAPACITY AROUND. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND. AND I THINK THAT KIND OF PROVIDE A CONTINUING TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THROUGH. THROUGH KIND OF POLICY SETTING THAT HELPS US. KIND OF HAVE STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE WORKING ON URBAN HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION. YOU KNOW HAD THINKING THROUGH COOL PAVEMENTS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T IT STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR FOR COOL PAVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHERE. THAT THE STATE CAN GET GET OUT AHEAD OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND. AND HELP. PROVIDE PROVIDE US KIND OF STANDARDS THAT THAT WE CAN ADOPT HAS ALWAYS REALLY HELPFUL IN THAT AREA AS WELL. EXAMPLE THANK YOU. THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS TO SAY THAT NOBODY NEEDS MORE RESOURCES. BECAUSE WE EVERYBODY DOES. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STEAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY BRIGHTS THUNDER WHO COMES UP RIGHT AFTER ME ABOUT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY BUT I THINK THE RESOURCE AGENCY HAS A REALLY GOOD IDEA ABOUT HOW. ON THE FLOODING IN RESILIENCE SIDE WE CAN WORK. WHICH IS TO ISSUE GUIDANCE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE TO HELP THEMSELVES FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S MORE RESILIENCE AND TO CREATE WORKSHOPS AND TO. BE DOWN THERE WITH THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT HOW ALL OF THAT WORKS. BECAUSE THE MORE THEY ACTUALLY SEE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY HAS THE ABILITY TO HELP FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE ARE. AND I THINK THAT THE RESOURCES AGENCY IS AS IS IS DOING A PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF THAT. I WOULD I WOULD END BY SAYING THAT I AM OF THE GENERATION. WHICH REMEMBERS. THE FRAM OIL FILTER COMPANY WHICH PROBABLY NOBODY ELSE DOES BUT IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR OIL FILTER. YOUR YOUR ENGINE BLOWS UP RIGHT. THEY USED TO HAVE A MARVELOUS COMMERCIAL THAT ALWAYS ENDED WITH THE SAYING. YOU CAN PAY ME NOW. OR YOU CAN PAY ME LATER. AND THE KEY THERE IS SPEND LESS MONEY NOW ON PREVENTION IN ORDER TO AVOID SPENDING MORE MONEY LATER ON CLEANING IT UP. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MAN. ANALOGY OR STATEMENT TO MAKE A. THAT IS OPERABLE TO A LOT OF WHAT WE DO. AND GOVERNMENT AND EVEN IN OUR OWN. PERSONAL. FINANCIAL ENDEAVORS THAT WHETHER IT'S A TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN HOME. ALRIGHT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE ROOF. THE OTHER THINGS KIND OF FOLLOWING THINK THE GOVERNOR DID A GOOD JOB IN USING THOSE TYPES OF. COMPARISONS WHEN HE WAS PUSHING HIS AGENDA I AS A RELEASE INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK IT'S APPLICABLE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL SO THANK YOU. TO ALL THREE OF YOU. FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WE APPRECIATE. THE INDULGENCE AND DALMA CALL UP THE NEXT THREE SPEAKERS THANK YOU YOU. KALEY BRIGHTWOOD CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. LOIS BED'S WORTH WITH GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PAIN RESURGENT KAREN SMITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS SIZE A PRESENTATION ON STATE EFFORTS TO GUIDE. THE ADAPTATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S START WITH THE UNDERSECRETARY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU I. THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. STAFF WE. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THIS HEARING AND INVITING US TO TESTIFY. IN. TO JUST INTRODUCE MYSELF MY NAME IS CALEY BRIGHT AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND. I MANAGE THAT CAN A PORTFOLIO OF MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION PROGRAMS UNDERNEATH THE AGENCY. SO JUMPING. A LITTLE BIT TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED THAT TO LARRY. FROM THE CDC AT THE END OF HIS TESTIMONY. I JUST WANTED OPEN UP BY SAYING PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL PLANNING IS GREAT. LOCALS NEED A LOTTA HELP PLANNING. BUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OTHER STATE PROGRAMS ARE PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL AND THAT'S GREAT NOT ALL LOCALS AND NOT ALL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGE VOLUNTARILY ENGAGING. IN PLANNING AFFRONT AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO. DRAG THEM ALONG. IT SOMETIMES LOCALS ENGAGE IN PLANNING AND DO THE RIGHT PLANS BUT THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE PLANS AND SOMETIMES ME LEVERAGE TO MAKE SURE THEY DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WANT TO DO. WE HAVE AT THIS MOMENT MORE RESOURCES IN OUR STATE BUDGET AND MORE RESOURCES ON THE BALLOT TO BE INCLUDED INTO THE STATE BUDGET. TIAS LEVERAGE TO FOR TO. INCENTIVIZE. ALL OF. THE ACTORS TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS WITH REGARDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE GOING FORWARD AND IN THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE MISTER CHAIR AND WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. REALLY A SET US UP IN A BETTER POSITION THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN AND. TO TAKE THIS WORK ON SO. YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOUR YOUR. YOUR WORK IS STARTING FROM A FROM A VERY SOUND AND HEALTHY FISCAL PLACE BUT WE ALSO HAVE. ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED IN THE POLICY TOOL BOXES WELL MAYBE NOT BUT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VERY GREAT WARD JUST A POLICY TOOLS TO TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. AND. YOU KNOW A LOT TO MOVE FORWARD ON SO TODAY YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA TALK I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE. STATES ACTIONS AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE FOR STATE PROGRAMS. IN HOW WE CAN MOBILIZE THE EFFORTS OF ALL OF ARE STATE PROGRAMS TOWARDS MEETING THESE GOALS THAT TRANSIT ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT POLICY AREAS. THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA. PLAN IS ESSENTIALLY THE BLUEPRINT FOR HOW THE STATE PLANS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IT IS A CATALOG OF THE ACTIONS THAT WERE DOING AT THE STATE. BUT ALSO A AND THAT KNOWLEDGE ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO SO YOU ASKED THE QUESTION OF WHAT ARE THE GAPS. THE BOOK THAT WE TODAY HEDGES SENSUALLY AS A BOOK OF IT SHOULD BE YOUR CHEAT SHEET FOR THESE OF THE GAPS THAT THE PROGRAM MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP OF OUR STATE. HAVE IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE YOU KNOW SPAN A BROAD SPECTRUM OF OF OF COST AND SIZE AND AND. DETAIL BUT THEY REALLY ARE MEANT TO GIVE THE POLICY THAT THAT'S IT'S QUITE IT'S QUITE A THREE DOCUMENT. THE REALLY MEANT TO GIVE YOU THE POLICY MAKERS AND. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH AND IN FUTURE. FUTURE LEADERS JUST THIS THIS CLEAR CLEAN BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT TO DO AND WHERE TO ACT ON. THE SCOPE OF THE PLAN IS DELIBERATELY CONSTRAINED AROUND STATE. GOVERNMENT AND ITS FUNCTIONS IN THE PAST THE PLAN HAS. WOVEN IN CLIMATE IMPACTS AND MORE CALLS TO ACTION BUT WE WERE VERY DELIBERATE AND AND AND AND DESIGNING THE PLAN AROUND. JUST THOSE SPECIFIC STEPS THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AS NECESSARY AND WE THOUGHT IT MADE A VERY MUCH CLEANER. PRESENTATION AND GAVE POLICYMAKERS MORE TO ACT ON. THE. SO WE ORGANIZED A PLAN. MUCH LIKE THE POLICY COMMITTEES IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEES ORGANIZED IN THE STATE. AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE YOU YOU NEED WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF IT IS NOT JUST ONE COMMITTEE. IT IS NOTS ONE DEPARTMENT ITS SUB THAT YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IMPACTS. EVERY AGENCY STATE GOVERNMENT AND EVERY PROGRAM SHOULD BE TUNING THEIR BASS LINES TO ADDRESS THESE. IMPACTS LIKE. HEAT ISLAND FACT SEA LEVEL RISE AT CETERA. WE HAVE ELEVEN DIFFERENT CHAPTERS IN THE PLAN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ENERGY LAND USE PUBLIC HEALTH TRANSPORTATION AGRICULTURE BIODIVERSITY FOREST'S. OCEAN COAST. WATER AND PARKS AND RECREATION IN CALIFORNIA CULTURE. IT'S ORGANIZED WITH ONE HIGH LEVEL RECOMMENDATION AT THE TOP OF EACH CHAPTER AND THEN CAPTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS UNDERNEATH THAT THAT SPELL OUT HOW TO GET TO THE HIGHER LEVEL RECOMMENDATION. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT I'VE PULLED OUT JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT BUT YOU CAN READ THROUGH THE PLAN LATER. ONE THAT TRANSLATES ACROSS MOST OF THE CHAPTERS IN IS INCORPORATE CLIMATE CONSIDERATIONS INTO PLANNING AT ALL LEVELS THIS WAS COVERED BY THE LAST PANEL. PRETTY IN DEPTH BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IS ESPECIALLY. IMPORTANT FOR AGENCIES LIKE CALTRANS TO WHO HAVE INCREDIBLE MANDATES TO DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE WITH NEW FUNDING IN THE NEXT COMING YEARS. CALTRAIN SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW SET UP AS A AS A REAL GOOD MODEL OF WHAT WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO THEY HAVE RECENTLY ENGAGED IN. VULNERABILITY REPORTS FOR THEIR ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND THEN ONCE THOSE REPORTS ARE DONE IT'LL BE VERY FASCINATING AND SOMETIMES POLITICAL TO SEE HOW THOSE REPORTS TRANSLATE TO THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PROCESS THAT IS CONTROLLED BY MANY DIFFERENT SIDES AS IT GOES DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE'LL BE WATCHING HOW THOSE PLANS DEVELOP AND THEY WILL ALSO BE WATCHING HOW THOSE THOSE. FUNDING DECISIONS ARE MADE DOWN TO THE GROUND. AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT. WHO CAN JUMP THROUGH SOME OF THESE? INCREASING WATER CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE NOT ONLY THROUGH. NOT ONLY THROUGH THE IRRIGATION SYSTEMS BUT ALSO THROUGH INCREASING THE SLOW CONTENT OF THE. OF OF OF THE SOIL ITSELF TO THE OF THE THE CARBON CONTENT OF THE SOIL ITSELF. I'M THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT JUST NOT ONLY AS A MITIGATION SOLUTION BUT ALSO AS AND. AS A PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTION FOR. FOOD PRODUCTION AND. IT IS REALLY EMERGING IN THE IN THE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS SPACE AS ONE OF THE KEY OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE USE OF OUR. WORKING LANDS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASE FOOD SECURITY IN THE PROCESS. ONE OF THE FINAL IN EXAMPLES OF RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY CAME FROM. OUR OUR MEETINGS IN YOUR DISTRICT WHEN WE MET WITH IN IN THE IN COACHELLA WE WERE TALKING TO HIM RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO SEE IN THIS PLAN. AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THE BACKGROUND BUT REALLY JUST CAME OUT FROM ALMOST EVERY ASIDE FROM YOUR. FROM YOUR RESIDENCE WAS THEY WANTED TO SEE HOW WE COULD SAFEGUARD RECREATIONAL RESOURCES. AND ACCESS TO NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE PUBLIC IN LIGHT OF CHANGING BOTH CHANGING IMPACTS TO THOSE RESOURCES ON THE BIODIVERSITY SIDE BUT ALSO INCREASED HEAT. AND AN ABILITY TO GO OUT IN THOSE HOT DAYS AND TO ENJOY THEMSELVES. AND YOU KNOW IT WAS REALLY TELLING YOU KNOW THEY WERE JUST THAT THAT. THAT SECTION IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE RESIDENTS WAS IT WAS REALLY TELLING THAT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THEY WANT TO SEE GOVERNMENT RESPOND IN WAYS THAT ARE IN OF COURSE MEANINGFUL AND IMPACTFUL TO THEM IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. ME THEY WANT THEIR ROADS THEY WANT THEIR MAJOR INTERSECTION BE PROTECTED. WITHIN THE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GO UP TO. THE WHITEWATER PRESERVE AND AND GO INTO THE DENOUNCED GO TO THE COOL WATER WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES IN THE VALLEY. WE. SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE PUT IN A CHAPTER ON ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECREATION HERE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH STATE PARKS. THROUGH TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU CREATE THOSE. THOSE THOSE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES STATEWIDE EVEN IN LIGHT OF THESE IMPACTS. WHICH GET EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WITH SEA LEVEL RISE CMAS FOR COASTAL RESOURCES ARE VERY LOW TO THE GROUND NEXT TO THE COAST AND WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE CAMPGROUNDS IT. MAY NOT BE CAMPGROUNDS. NEXT WE WE WORKED VERY HARD TO INCORPORATE A CLIMATE JUSTICE CHAPTER INTO THIS REPORT. IT WAS. TO TO TO BE HONEST IT WAS. IT'S NOT EASY TO SO WE WORKED PRESS THIRTY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IT'S NOT EASY TO TAKE THIRTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES INTO A CLIMATE JUSTICE CONVERSATION. AND REALLY GET A MEANINGFUL INTERACTION THAT IN THE END RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT REPRESENT WHAT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THOSE NONPROFITS WRITER CALLING FOR. WHEN. WE DID THIS WE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS HELP FROM THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT PARTICIPANTS FROM NONPROFIT GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE. AND. WE WENT TO A VERY. INTENSIVE BACK AND FORTH PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THOSE ACTUAL HOW WE COULD TO THE EXISTING RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PUBLIC DRAFT BUT ALSO. BRING IN NEW RECOMMENDATIONS TO REPRESENT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT THAT. THAT THAT ARE FACED AND IN A IN THE AND WE FEEL VERY PROUD OF. OF THE CLIMATE EQUITY CHAPTER THAT WE HAVE IN THE FRONT OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT AND THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO SHOWCASE NOT ONLY THAT. THESE ROOM YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES BUT IT'S THE ONE PLACE IN THE DOCUMENT YOU CAN SEE HOW EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER INTO ONE COHESIVE PACKAGE IT'S NOT. BROKEN INTO DIFFERENT POLICY AREA SILOS SO. FOR THIS FOR US THAT'S GOING TO BE. A REALLY IMPORTANT BLUEPRINT FOR JUST ADDRESSING THE EQUITY ISSUES ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT WORK IN THE NEXT VERSIONS OF MATURING THAT WORK. WITH THE SAME NETWORKS BECAUSE THAT WAS JUST INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. THE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN ITSELF IS IS IS IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY IT CAN BE IT'S MORE BEHIND THE SCENES AND PROCESS ORIENTED. WE. SO AS I MENTIONED WE WORKED WITH OVER THIRTY INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO DEVELOP THE PLAN. WE WORKED FROM THE BOTTOM UP FROM THE PROGRAM LEVEL UP TO THE EXECUTIVE TO IDENTIFY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. GENERALLY SPEAKING PROGRAM YOU KNOW. THOSE WHO THE PROGRAMS ARE IN THE LATER STAGES OF THEIR CAREERS AND HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS THE SAME WAY FOR MANY. FOR MANY YEARS AND AREN'T ALWAYS AS WELCOME TO CHANGES WE WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW WE WOULD ALL LIKE. AND AND THE. THE STAFF THAT WERE PUT IN CHARGE OF DRIVING THE. PLAN AND AND I THINK THERE THINK ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF THE PLAN. YOU KNOW THEY REALLY REPRESENT A NEW GENERATION OF STATE CIVIL SERVANTS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE. AND THEY WERE GIVEN THE VERY UNPLEASANT TASK OF. KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF THE OF THE OF THE PROGRAM MANAGER WHO ME WHO'S FAIRLY SEND THEIR WAYS AND TELLING THEM HE GOTTA YOU GOTTA YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONSIDER CW X. Y. AND Z. AND. CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE DOING AND AND IT WAS IT WAS. VERY PROMISING TO SEE THAT WILLINGNESS BY THOSE PROGRAM MANAGERS TAKE THE STEPS THAT THEY RECOMMENDED. IT WAS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE. IN THE PAST I THINK THIS MORE IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT BUT. THIS TIME AROUND OF SIP IT WAS ENCOURAGING HOW LITTLE WE HAD TO PUSH THESE AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS SO. WE FEEL WE YOU KNOW THAT PROCESSES SOCIALIZING CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES IN THE END WE REALLY HOPE THAT YOU DON'T NEED AN AGENCY TO COORDINATE CLIMATE CHANGE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS I MEAN THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING OURSELVES OUT OF A. OUT OF A JOB IN MANY WAYS HE'S JUST BE BASELINE CONSIDERATIONS THE PROGRAMS. THINK ABOUT INCORPORATE INTO THEIR INTO THEIR INTO THEIR ACTIONS. THE NEXT PIECE THAT I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON IS THAT WE'VE WE WERE WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO DEVELOP. METRICS. IN WAYS TO TRACK PROGRESS ON THE DOCUMENT ITSELF. WE WANT. SAFEGUARDING TO TO BE A TRANSPARENT. ACCOUNTABILITY TOOL FOR FOR FOR OUR FOR OURSELVES BUT ALSO FOR EVERYBODY WATCHING GOVERNMENT I MEAN IT SHOULD BE THE THING THAT PEOPLE GRAB IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH TRANSPORTATION OR WHATNOT. YOU SHOULD USE THAT AND THEN REALLY PUSHED. GOVERNMENT ON ARE YOU ACHIEVING THESE GOALS THAT YOU SET OUT. AND. YOU KNOW WE KINDA EXPOSED HERSELF IN MANY WAYS THERE BY PUTTING THAT OUT THERE BUT IT'S IT IT WAS INTENTIONAL BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO WE CAN BE PUSHED HARDER. AND AND MAKE THIS PROGRESS. WE WILL GO FORWARD AND PUT OUT REPORTS BY THE END OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND. THEN LATER ON ON HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN AND MEETING THESE GOALS BUT. NEED I THINK WITH THE METRICS IN A PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL THAT WE TRACK. TRACK THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON POPULATION BUT ALSO THAT IN THAT CAN HELP US FIND TO NO RESPONSE. THE. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY KIND OF WRAP THIS UP IS. WE'RE SEEING AS SINCE WE RELEASED AS PLANNED. THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO BUT IT'S ALSO THE SAME TYPE OF EXERCISE THE LOCALS NEED TO DO AS WELL. AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF INTERESTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE PRODUCT THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER. THEY THEY THEY'RE USING IT AS A MODEL IN MANY CASE WORK WERE WORKING WITH THEM. AND WE REALLY HELP THAT THOUGH THEY'LL TAKE WHAT WE DID IMPROVE UPON IT AND SOAP AND RELIEF LEAPFROG THE STATE SO WE CAN COME OUT. NEXT TIME WE WRITE THIS PLAN AND AND AND DO IT IN A YOU KNOW JUST KEEP INFORMING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THIS IS ALL. THIS IS A BRAND NEW AND AND AND REALLY FIRST OF ITS KIND WORK IN THE COUNTRY AND AND AND. THE CROSS COUNTRY SO WERE. WERE OR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HELP FOR TRYING TO PUT A MODEL OUT THERE AND WE GLADLY ACCEPT PEOPLE'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO DO DO IT BETTER THE NEXT TIME. I THINK WE ALL ARE IN A BETTER PLACE IF WE DO. FINAL FULL FINAL FINAL COMMENT IS ALL OF THIS WORK ON WHAT WE WILL DO WILL BE BACKED UP BY THE SCIENCE OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT. CLIMATE CHANGE THE SUMMER WE WILL BE RELEASING THEM THE CALIFORNIA OF THE FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. BY THE STATE IN WHICH WILL INCLUDE ABOUT FIFTY DIFFERENT. REPORTS ON ACTUAL CLIMATE IMPACTS FOR FOR FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS IN OUR IN OUR STATE IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. THOSE REPORTS WILL GET DOWN TO THE FINE GRAIN DETAIL OF HOW MANY. HOW MUCH? YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT FIRE SEVERITY WILL BE WHAT. HOW HOW FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE IMPACTED THAT CETERA AND THEN THEY'LL WE WRAPPED INTO REGIONALIZED REGIONAL REPORTS AND TOPICAL REPORT SO? IN IN EACH REGION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A REALLY CRYSTAL CLEAR SNAPSHOT OF WHAT IS THAT IMPACT GOING TO BE IN THAT REGION. AND THEN THAT CAN THEN TRANSLATE INTO THE SAFEGUARDING PLAN ON HOW TO THOSE PROGRAMS CONNECT TO THOSE IMPACTS. AND. SO WITH THAT WE I THINK ALL A PAUSE AND AND AND AND LET MY COLLEAGUES GO PORTER TAKE QUESTIONS HOW DO YOU THINK YOU WILL COME BACK TO KOREA QUESTIONS I WAS INTERESTED IN THE. AND WE'LL GET TO DETAILS OF. BUT THERE NAY AGENCY THAT DIDN'T PARTICIPATE AND IF SO WAS IT JUST. NO INTERSECTION OF THE ISSUE BUT WE CAN GO BACK TO THAT WILL WANT AN ACCREDITATION. AND THAT CAN THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LOUISE BED'S WORTH ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. AND I WILL PICK UP REALLY I AM ON THE THE PLANNING ELEMENTS AROUND ADAPTATION AND SOME OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING AT OPR. BOWS TO WORK ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES BUT REALLY TO SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN WORKING AROUND. AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. INSULTS CERTAIN. WITH TALKING ABOUT THE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES POTATO CAME UP EARLIER. SO LAST YEAR PARA COMPLETED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE UPDATES THE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES IN OVER A DECADE. AND THAT BEGAN WITH I JUST THE FACT THAT IT NEEDED THING THEY NEEDED TO BE UPDATED BUT WITH SEVERAL GOALS IN MIND ONE WAYS TO INTEGRATE CLIMATE CHANGE CONSIDERATIONS THROUGHOUT. THAT DOCUMENT AND INTO THAT PROCESS OVERALL. ENDED IDEALLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO. TO ALIGN THEIR GENERAL PLAN WITH CLIMATE ACTION PLANS AND OTHER CLIMATE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE UNDERTAKING. WHILE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THAT UPDATE SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY NINE. WAS SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTEGRATE CLIMATE RISK INTO THE SAFETY ELEMENT OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN. AND SO WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES RIGHT NOW OF IT WE HAVE PROVIDED GUIDANCE. BOTH. IN HOW TO DO THAT IN THE SAFETY ELEMENT BUT THEN ALSO HOW TO REALLY THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GENERAL PLAN. WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION AND WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE. IMPLEMENTING SP THREE SEVENTY NINE AND GOING THROUGH THE SAFETY ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS NOW SINGLE MORTAR REPORT ON THAT BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK HIS HANDS ON HIS WE CAN WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION WE POINT TO THE SCIENCE IN THE TOOLS AT THE STATE HAS PRODUCED SOME CLUED IN THE ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE IN KALIDAS. AND OTHER TOOLS TO SUPPORT THAT WORK. ANOTHER OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE WE HAD WE UNDERTOOK THE UPDATE WAS TO INTEGRATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY INTO THE DOCUMENT OVERALL. AGAIN EYES SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND PASSED WHILE WE WERE OUT WORKING ON THE UPDATE. AND SO FOLLOWING WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF DOING A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC OUTREACH AROUND THAT AND WILL BE RELEASING AND BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. REVISED GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION. I MENTAL JUSTICE. I SHOULD SAY THAT GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES UPDATE PROCESS. TOOK A NUMBER TOOK SEVERAL YEARS TO DO IT WAS BASED ON A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. AND INPUT. AND WE'VE CREATED A DOCUMENT THAT I WE HOPE IS SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO ONE THAT WE CAN UPDATE AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE WHAT DOING THEIR GENERAL PLAN WORK. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OF HOW WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS ALSO THROUGH. A GROUP CALLED THE ALLIANCE OF REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION OR ARCA. AND THIS IS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO WORK WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IS PORT. CLIMATE ADAPTATION THEY ARE ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE UPDATING THEIR GENERAL PLANS. BUT ARCA INCLUDES MEMBERS FROM SEVERAL MAJOR REGIONS AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING. SACRAMENTO THE BAY AREA A LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO THERE ARE. COLLABORATIVE SWARMING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE INLAND EMPIRE AYE AND THE CENTRAL COAST. AND THIS IS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORK WE'RE DOING CAN SUPPORT WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'M AND REALLY. CREATE BETTER ALIGNMENT. ANOTHER AND IT INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE BEEN UNDERTAKING AT OPR IS THIS THEN THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM. AND THIS IS CREATED THROUGH LEGISLATION THROUGH SENATE BILL TWO FOUR SIX SIX WHICH WAS CITED A LOT IN AYE. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WHAT YOU CALL THIS AYE CARP BECAUSE WE NEED AN ACRONYM FOR EVERYTHING. THEIR TWO PRIMARY ELEMENTS TO THIS PROGRAM ONE IS A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL. THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT INCLUDES STATE REPRESENTATION LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS AND PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBERS. BUT IT WAS REALLY ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE COORDINATION ACROSS STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS AROUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION. WE MEET QUARTERLY. IN A PUBLIC VENUES WE HAVE PUBLICLY NOTICE AND I MEETINGS AND. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE PUBLICLY NOTICE WORKGROUP MEETING. THEY WERE EVEN MEETING AROUND THE STATE AYE WE JUST STARTED LAST YEAR SO WE'VE HAD FIVE MEETINGS TO DATE. AND WE'VE TAKEN ON A SEVERAL TASKS AS A GROUP. THE FIRST WAS THAT ADOPTED THE ADOPTION OF A VISION AND SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR ADAPTATION ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT TECHNICAL VICE THREE COUNCIL NOTED. WAS WE ALL WANT TO SUPPORT ADAPTATION BUT WE NEED A BETTER IDEA AND RESILIENCE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS. AND IT'S HARD TO SET A QUANTITATIVE TARGET FOR THAT AND SO WE AS A GROUP DID WAS ADOPTED A VISION AND A SET OF PRINCIPLES FOR ACHIEVING THAT VISION. AND THAT VISION REALLY LOOKS AT A VERY HOLISTIC. APPROACH WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RESILIENCE OF NOT JUST OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT OF OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AND OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS. AND HOW DOES ALL WORK TOGETHER AND ULTIMATELY TO ACHIEVE A STATE OF RESILIENCE WE NEED TO THINK ACROSS ALL OF THOSE. PIECES. AND THEN. AND THEN WITH THAT WE'VE IN THING ABOUT HOW IS IT THAT WE TRACK OUR PROGRESS OF BUILDING OFF OF SAFEGUARDING US WORK AND THOSE ACTIONS. HOW IS IT THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING FROM PLANNING THROUGH TO IMPLEMENTATION? ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THAT WORK HAS BEEN AROUND PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS CALLED OUT. IN EXECUTIVE ORDER B. THIRTY FIFTEEN WHICH GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED IN APRIL TWENTY FIFTEEN SO I CALLED OUT AND SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA MENTIONED IN THE PANEL PREVIOUSLY BUT. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE REALLY PRIORITIZE PROTECTION OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA? AND SO RECENTLY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO DEFINE WHATTHAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO WHAT IS IT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO VULNERABILITY IT'S NOT JUST EXPOSURE TO CLIMB AT RISK. SOME OF THE INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULATIONS IN LOCATIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO VULNERABILITY. AND SO WE ARE WORKING TO FINALIZE SOME RESOURCE MATERIALS THAT CAN HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND THAT WILL FEED INTO THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE AYE CAR PROGRAM WHICH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE. AND SO. I THE CLEARINGHOUSE IS BASICALLY IS A A RESOURCE THAT'S DESIGNED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING AND DOING ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE WORK ON THE GROUND. IS INTENDED TO BRING TO A CENTRALIZED. PORTAL ITS ONLINE TOOL. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INFO. SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ACCESS OR STATE AGENCIES ARE REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS. SO IT'S WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UC BERKELEY TO DEVELOP THIS TOOL IT'S REALLY USER FRIENDLY DATABASE. THAT YOU CAN SEARCH THROUGH DEBT NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEANS YOU CAN GO IN AND LOOK AT A TOPIC. YOU COULD LOOK AT A CERTAIN IMPACT IMPACT YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS ALL THE INFORMATION THROUGH A MAP INTERFACE IF YOU WANTED TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR REGION OR IN YOUR COUNTY. YOU CAN DO THAT. THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESOURCES IN THE CLEARING HOUSE INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS GENERAL PLANS GUIDANCE COMMUNICATION EDUCATION MATERIALS. CASE STUDIES AND OTHER EXAMPLES IN ADDITION WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING A SET OF SMALL FIRST PERSON NARRATIVES. THAT JUST EXPLAIN HOW PEOPLE ORDERED ARE DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE EITHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL OR WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S CLEARING HOUSE WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO HIGHLIGHT RESORT AND CONNECT THESE RESOURCES SO IT TIES DIRECTLY INTO CAL ADOPT WHICH HOUSES ALL OF THE CLIMATE DATA INFORMATION FOR. THE SAME AS WELL AS THE ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE AND OTHER. SUMMARIZE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES ETCETERA I THE CLEARINGHOUSE IS CURRENTLY IN A BETA TESTING PHASE II AND THE WEBSITE IS RESILIENCY A DOT ORG. AND SO. WE DOES DESIGNED IT AFTER A NUMBER OF USER NEEDS WORKSHOPS AROUND THE STATE AND WITH STATE AGENCIES AS WELL. AND UTILITIES AND OTHERS ARE AS OF TODAY ARMS THROUGH MID MARCH WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY RESOURCES IN THAT. CLEARING HOUSE AND THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW FOR EVERY SECTOR EVERY REGION AND EVERY IMPACT AREA. THE LARGEST NUMBER OF RESOURCES AT THIS POINT ARE AVAILABLE FOR CHO SIN OCEANS AND SEA LEVEL RISE GUIDANCE. AYE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WHO HAD A SIMILAR DIRECTIVE TO MAKE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SEA LEVEL RISE PLANNING. SO RATHER THAN BUILD TWO SEPARATE DATABASES WE DECIDED TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE ONE. AND SO THAT IS ALL HOUSED IN THIS CLEARING HOUSE. LOOKING AHEAD WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THAT RESOURCE. AND THE UTILITY OF THE CLEARING HOUSE SINCE THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE THE INTEGRATION OF NEW MATERIAL AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE INCLUDING ALL OF THE STUDIES FROM THE FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. LINKING IT TO STATE INVESTMENTS AS APPROPRIATE SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CALTRANS TO BRING IN INFORMATION ON THE SP ONE ADAPTATION PLANNING GRANTS EVERY GRANTEE WILL BE. SUBMITTING CASE STUDIES THAT WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE CLEARING HOUSE. WILL ALSO BE JUST REGULARLY CURATING AND UPDATING IT SO THAT WE GET RID OF OUT OF DATE MATERIALS. AND MAKE SURE THAT IN THE NEWEST INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. I'M IN THAT TOOL. AND SO OVER ALL OUR EFFORTS HAVE REALLY BEEN AROUND ENSURING AND MAKING OUT TO MAKE RESOURCES AND TOOLS AVAILABLE AND TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY ARE UNDERTAKING THE WORK TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SO I'LL CONCLUDE THERE AND THEN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LATER. YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GARCIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I'M DOCTOR KAREN SMITH THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT. THEY THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH THE PREVIOUS PANEL ALSO TOUCHED ON BUT ALSO WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING IN THIS AREA. COMEY CHANGE REALLY DOES POSE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH INCLUDING DIRECT EFFECTS LIKE SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER INCREASES IN AS MY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE FROM INCREASING AIR POLLUTION. INJURIES. DEATH AND. OTHER IMPACTS OF SEVERE CLIMATE EVENTS BUT ALSO TO. IMPACTS ON MENTAL HEALTH OF INCREASING A CLIMATE EVENTS AS WELL PARTICULARLY SEVERE STORMS AND THINGS ACROSS DISPLACEMENT. OTHER LESS OBVIOUS THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH FROM GLOBAL WARMING IN PARTICULAR THOSE LIKE CHANGES IN VECTOR ECOLOGY WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN THE MIGRATION OF. EIGHTIES EGYPT I MOSQUITO THE CARRIER OF BOTH SEEK A VIRUS BUT ALSO YELLOW FEVER A MUCH MORE SERIOUS VIRUS. INTO THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES INCLUDING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THESE SAME ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS ARE ON HUMAN HEALTH WILL HAVE MUCH MORE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD OBVIOUSLY WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SHORTAGE. AND. DIFFICULTY. WITH CLEAN WATER MALNUTRITION DOTS AND SO ON. CLIMATE CHANGE THOUGH IS AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS THAT I THE PREVIOUS PANEL SPOKE ABOUT THIS BUT I THOUGHT WHAT I WOULD DO IS GIVE YOU A FEW NUMBERS JUST TO PROVIDE SOME. CONTEXT IT WITH IN CALIFORNIA. DOCTOR RICH SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT EXTREME HEAT AND THE CHALLENGES OF EXTREME HEAT. THAT'S PROBABLY AREA WHICH IN CALIFORNIA WE SEE THE GREATEST DIRECT LOSS OF LIFE AND ILLNESS. THERE ARE TWENTY TO SIXTY HEAT RELATED DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WERE FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HEAT RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS THESE ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT NUMBERS. HE ILLNESS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS PEOPLE WHO WORK OUTDOORS AND THE ELDERLY AND IS ALSO HAS. BEGINNING CHAU IAN LINKS TO INFANT MORTALITY THAT'S AN AREA THAT NEEDS MORE DATA THAT WERE WORKING ON. LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRES OBVIOUSLY ALSO LEAD TO INJURIES DEATHS AND INCREASED RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR ILLNESSES. AND COMMUNITIES ALSO SUFFERED FROM IMPORTANT INDIRECT IMPACTS OF OF FIRES INCLUDING PROPERTY LOSS RESIDENTIAL DISPLACEMENT LOSS OF JOBS. IT'S OVER AND THIS HAS. UMPS PROFOUND IMPACT NOT JUST ON THE INDIVIDUALS BUT THEN ON THEIR FAMILIES MOVING FORWARD THROUGH TIME. PEOPLE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING. INCREASING. MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS FROM. FROM CLIMATE EVENTS. LET'S SEE HIM. WE DID A SURVEY. IT OF RESIDENTS AMERICA CENTRAL LARRY COUNTY DURING. AND AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FOUR YEAR DROUGHT THE JETS KIND OF THE REALLY INTERESTING CASE STUDY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A LONG AND DRAWN OUT EVENT. IN SAVED WE WE'VE SURVEYED RESIDENTS IN MARIPOSA AND TULARE COUNTY AND FOUND THAT BETWEEN SIXTEEN TO FORTY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. EXIT EXACERBATE HAD EXACERBATIONS OF THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS DURING THE DROUGHT AND OVER A QUARTER HAD NEGATIVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THEIR PROPERTY AND FINANCES WHICH HAS EVEN GREATER. LONG TERM. EFFECTS ON THE ENTIRE FAMILY I'M WE'VE ALSO SEEN WORSENING AIR QUALITY AND INCREASE RISK RELATED TO WEST NILE VIRUS HANTAVIRUS AND VALLEY FEVER. AS WELL AS I'M EXHILARATED SALTWATER INTRUSION ON FRESH WATER SOURCES. I THIS IS BEEN MENTIONED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT FOR US AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OUR FOCUSES ON HEALTH EQUITY IN ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE AND AND WITH. THE GREATEST WELLNESS POSSIBLE INCREASINGLY THOUGH WHAT WERE SO WE SEE THAT THE RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED SOME POPULATIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE AND IN PARTICULAR. THOSE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES YOUNG CHILDREN OLDER ADULTS PREGNANT WOMEN OUTDOOR WORKERS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED. OR WITH WHO HAVE CHRONIC MEDICAL TO CONDITIONS INCLUDING MENTAL ILLNESS. THESE ARE POPULATIONS THAT ARE FACING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THAT EXACERBATE ALL OF THOSE SAME VULNERABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COMMUNITIES COLOR MORE LIKELY TO RESIDE IN AREAS WITH MORE PAYMENT LESS PARKS ENTRY CANOPY WE'VE HAD AN EXCELLENT DISCUSSION BY DOCTOR ROADS FOR URBAN HEAT ISLANDS. THE EXISTING INEQUITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE IN WHICH MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES LIVE. ARE THEN JUST EXACERBATED. I'M THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT THAT. ARE SO PREVALENT IN OUR COMMUNITY. YEAH DPH WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZE THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND. ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THAT THEY WILL WORSEN THE EXISTING HEALTH INEQUITIES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY PROGRAM. IS ACTUALLY HOUSED IN OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY BECAUSE EQUITY IS AT THE HEART OF FOR US. OUR WORK AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE PROGRAM TOUCHES. OVER IT VIRTUALLY EVERY OF OUR TWO HUNDRED PLUS PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT. ARE BUT OUR EFFORTS ARE LARGELY FOCUSED AROUND MITIGATION ADAPTATION OF A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR STATE AGENCY PARTNERS I'M OUR HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES PROGRAM ALSO DOES IT A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I WANTED IS HIGHLIGHT ONE EXAMPLE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND THAT'S THE CAL GRACE CALIFORNIA BREAK. BUILDING RESILIENCE AGAINST CLIMATE AFFECTS PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED BY A GRANT FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND THAT WITHOUT TO. WORK IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. IN PARTICULAR TO BUILD CLOUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION CAPACITY AND ENHANCE RESILIENCE BOTH AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS THE TOOLS THAT CAO BREEZE I AM HAS DEVELOPED. ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO INCORPORATE BOTH CLIMATE PROJECTIONS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY DATA WE WORK IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA AT NEAR DISEASE DISTRICTS DISTRIBUTIONS ETCETERA ALL THE TIME IT'S AT THE CORE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH DOES. WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WITH CAL BRACES THAT ALSO OVERLAY THAT WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING COMMUNITIES WHICH ALLOWS US TO BETTER? CREATE TOOLS THAT THAT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CAN USE THAT 沇A ADAPTATION PLANTS OR MITIGATION PLANS FOR THEIR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. WE CREATED CLIMATE VULNERABILITY PROFILES FOR EVERY. COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE THAT I'M BEING USED BY LOCAL CULTURE STATIONS. TO HELP. TO A UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE IMPACTS ARE AND BE WHERE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES THOUGH IN THOSE IMPACTS ARE LIKELY TO BE GREATEST. THEY ALSO OVERLAPS SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TRAIN. PROGRAMS BOTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL AS WITHIN PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF FEMA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR EMERGENCY. PLANS YOUR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THESE KINDS OF OF EVENTS HE'S KIND OF CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES. AND SO WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES TO I'M TRYING TO HELP THEM. YUM WE ALSO LEVERAGE SOME OF THEIR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SPENDING WHICH THEY GOT THROUGH CDC VIA THIS THE DEPARTMENT. TO WORK ON SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THESE CLIMATE. VULNERABILITIES. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT CAO BRACES ALSO DEVELOPED. SOME NEW DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS USING GIS MAPPING TO REALLY HONE DOWN WITHIN COMMUNITIES WHERE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE LIKELY TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IN TERMS OF. WHETHER IT'S URBAN GREENING OR OTHER KINDS OF. IMPACTS WEEK IN SOME WAYS HAVE A LEG UP IN PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE VIRTUALLY. EVERYTHING THAT WE DO TO. COMBAT A CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS OBESITY HYPERTENSION AT CETERA ARE THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU DO IN ORDER TO MAKE HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT AND. TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE SO. I'M ALL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ALL OF GO BACK TO YEAH UNDERSECRETARY TERMS OF THE. FULL PARTICIPATION OF OLIVER AGENCIES DID WORK WHERE THERE ANY OF THE. AGENCIES THAT PERHAPS DIDN'T. SEE FIT AND YOU KNOW THERE. SITEMINIS COLLINS KATE THAT IT'S HARD SO THERE MAY BE RIGHT THERE MAY BE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO. THEY'RE SO SO WITHIN EACH AGENCY AYE I CAN SAY THAT THERE WERE THERE WERE DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW THE THAT. AGENCIES THINK ABOUT THEIR THEIR MISSION AND THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR DAY TO DAY JOBS IN TERMS OF WHAT OF WHAT DO THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE. TO TO TALK TO MISSION SO IF YOU'RE WORKING IN WATER FLOODING THE DO WITH LEVEES. YOU KNOW AS AN EXAMPLE D. W. OURS DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF OF BRINGING IN CLIMATE. CLIMATE INFORMATION TO INFORM HOW THEY PLANNED FOR FLOODING IN THEIR MODEL FOR THIS. OTHER OTHER AGENCIES. YOU KNOW ARE DOING A GREAT JOB THINKING ABOUT. WHAT'S THE COME TO THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THEY JUST THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. WHAT KIND OF PAVEMENT DO WE NEED TO APPLY IN THIS REGION SINCE WE KNOW THE TEMPERATURE MIGHT BE GOING UP? IN THAT PAVEMENT MIGHT NEED TO BE REQUIRED JUST SO YOU KNOW I CAN'T. I CAN'T YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT ONE AGENCY THAT REALLY DIDN'T DIDN'T RESPOND TO US BUT I AM OF THE BEAUTY OF THE PLANET YOU CAN YOU CAN LOOK AT AND STAKEHOLDERS CAN LOOK AT AND SAY. THIS IS COMPLETELY DEFICIENT DO YOU NEED TO DO THIS THE SURPRISE IT'S A SO THAT'S ACCOUNTABILITY OR THIS IS GREAT. OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING THIS THIS AND THIS ITS AND I I JUST I JUST LOOK AT IT FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK IT'S VERY RELEVANT BUT I STILL. HAVE TO WORK ON CONNECTING THE DOTS TO FOLKS. MY CONSTITUENCY ON WHY MATTER EDUARDO IS WORKING ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES. RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND. THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DEGREE DAYS. YOU KNOW DURING THE SUMMERTIME CLEARLY CAN THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THAT RIGHT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN OUR DISTRICT AND CERTAINLY. ADDING TO THE ANOTHER JUSTIFICATION Y.. AT THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO ME AND SHOULD BE TO EVERYONE IN THE DISTRICTS SO. YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE AN AGENCY THAT SAYS YOU KNOW I. PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY IT COULD SAY. HEY YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY DEAL WITH THAT BUT YET THERE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE. YOU KNOW. ELEMENTS TO HAVING TO ADDRESS THE FLOODING ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER RIGHT OR THE. YOU KNOW THE HEAT STROKE. COMPONENTS RIGHT THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WILL INCREASE. THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES AT A HOSPITAL SO I JUST. CURIOUS WHY BECAUSE THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO MAY LOOK AT IT FROM A PERSPECTIVE. OF WHAT THEY DO AND ONLY WHAT THEY DO AND SAY. THAT DOES NOT REALLY AFFECT US AND SO WE'RE NOT. NEEDING TO PARTICIPATE BUT I APPRECIATE THEM THE ANSWER IN. I GUESS ALL OF YOUR PARTNERS THAT THE AGENCY SHOULD FEEL GOOD THAT THEY HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU NOT THAT NINE THEM UNDER US. SO. KUDOS TO YOU HOW HARD. I WANT TO. TO YOU KNOW THE AND MENTIONED EARLIER COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE RECOGNIZE AND AS I'VE BEEN UP HERE THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND WE PASS POLICIES TO GIVE OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MORE TOOLS RIGHT COME MORE TOOLS TO DO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHETHER IT BE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS OR OTHER. ELEMENTS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND SELDOM REALLY. DO ANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS AND I CAN SPEAK FOR THE ONES IN MY DISTRICT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM SO I'M WONDERING. HOW ARE WE DETERMINING IF IN FACT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS? TO QUESTION FOUR OP ARIAS'S AYE WE SEEN. FOLKS ACTUALLY GONNA COME AND. BEGIN USING THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING YOUR SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ENERGY AND RESOURCES AND REALLY CONSOLIDATING. TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. AND TOOLS. ARE WE LOOKING AT THIS AT THE END OF THE YEAR EVERY TWO YEARS AND SAYING. OKAY PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES. YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE DO TRACK OUR PROGRESS AND OF HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING IN OF COURSE. WITH THAT AS WITH STATE AGENCIES THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND HOW THEY APPROACH IT THIS SUMMER. GOING OUT. VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN AND SOME YOU HAVE TO PULL ALONG A LITTLE MORE I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT. NOTE IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS ALSO DO WE DON'T WANT TO JUST PUSH INFORMATION OUT. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE CAN'T JUST THROW INFORMATION AND TOOLS OUT THERE AND EXPECT FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN UP. IT'S A TWO WAY STREET AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THROUGH. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES THROUGH THE INTEGRATED CRIME ADAPTATION RESILIENCY PROGRAM IS CREATE MORE OF THAT BACK AND FORTH SO. IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF OUR TIME AND RESOURCES OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TIME AND RESOURCES IF WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER. SO I THINK. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARE THEY USING TOOLS WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO. SO WE CAN BETTER PROVIDE INFORMATION RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. YOU KNOW AND THEN AND CREATE A VENUE TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT WE CAN LEARN FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THAT'S WHY IT WOULD I MENTION THE REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. SO I I THINK WE ARE THE ANSWER IS YES WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS WE'RE SEEING INFORMATION BEING TAKEN UP BUT THERE'S WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER AND CONTINUING TO PREP PROVIDING. YOU KNOW THE RIGHT SUPPORT AND AND HEAR WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO. YEAH PLEASE ADDED AND I PUT THIS IN THE BEGINNING OF MY POINTS AND I THINK YOU ALSO NEED. USE YOUR LITTLE YOUR LEVERS TO PUSH CERTAIN LOCALS TO DO THESE THINGS OUT AND AND WITH OUR WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET IN THE STATE IS AND WITH THESE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH. YOU KNOW S. B. ONE FUNDS POTENTIAL PROP SIXTY EIGHT PRIOR BOND FUNDS DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISMS HERE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO. TO TO PUSH AND PULL THESE GUYS EVEN. AGREED RIGHT I THINK FOR FOR US A. AND THE LIGHT BULB GOES ON RIGHT WITH MY FORMER COLLEAGUES. THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING ALLOCATED IN THE SPECIFIC AREAS. WHAT COMES TO MIND IS YOU KNOW A CITY THAT'S IT WILL SAY YOU KNOW WE WE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE OF? X. Y. AND Z. REASONS IN PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ASSERTIVE. PLANNING. GOING INTO A LINING WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNING AS A. PLANNING EFFORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO THEN. ALIGN THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS RIGHT FOR. THESE OPPORTUNITIES IS. AS SIMPLE AS YOU KNOW UPDATING THE GENERAL PLANS IN INTEGRATING THESE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COULD POTENTIALLY. LEAD TO SOME OF THESE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AYE THAT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT SO. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO STILL. IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OUR REGIONAL. COGS OUT THERE THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY I MEAN YOU KNOW I SIT ON THE. A ARE BE BORED AND WE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES TO HELP IN THIS MEET SOME OF OUR REDUCTION GOALS. OVERALL IN THINK THIS ALL FALLS IN LINE WITH THE CONVERSATION. THE WAR HAVE BEEN. NUMBER ONE TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH THE EXTREME HERE YOU KNOW FOR US. BEING ABLE TO MEASURE YOU KNOW OUR EFFORTS INVESTMENTS IN A PLACE LIKE IMPERIAL COUNTY THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY. A POOR AIR QUALITY AND THE HIGH LEVELS OF COURSE THE OUTCOME OF THAT MEANING HIGH LEVELS OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE. PROBLEMS AMONGST CHILDREN AND ADULTS YOU KNOW WE'D LOVE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE INFORMATION GAP AS IT RELATES TO THE INVESTMENTS MEAN MADE AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE OUTCOMES THAT REDUCING. YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BAD THAT ARE RELEVANT TO RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS ARE MAKING YOU KINDA MAYBE ELABORATE AND SEE. WHAT OTHER WAYS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO INTEGRATE SOME KIND OF BENCHMARKS FOR US TO BE ABLE? TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW OUTCOMES OF OUR EFFORTS. I THINK THAT. WE DID AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES TO WE DO HAVE. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON HEALTH ON PARTICULAR HEALTH INDICATORS AND. SUE AND WE HAVE SOME TOOLS TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THOSE OUT BUT UNFORTUNATELY RA AD IN CURRENT STATE SO FOR EXAMPLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS WERE. ACTIVELY WORKING RIGHT NOW TO PURSUE THE. THE IT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MUCH MORE REAL TIME CURRENTLY WE'RE SORT OF ALWAYS WORKING. ANYWHERE FROM. IF WE'RE LUCKY A MONTH TO SIX MONTHS BEHIND TO WE CAN DO LOTS OF RETROSPECTIVE LOOKING AT. TRENDS OVER TIME AND TRYING TO DRAW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT. AN ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE IS WITH OF THE VARIOUS NOW METRICS OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER BOTH. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BUT ALSO HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER OTHER. ASPECTS THAT WE KNOW CONTRIBUTE TO OVERALL HEALTH THINGS LIKE. ECONOMICS IN EDUCATION AS WE'VE BUILT THESE SORT OF COMPOUNDED INDICATORS OF HEALTH WE CAN BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES THAT MAY MOVE THAT OVER ON THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE CRAPPIE CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS TOO. FOR. FOR EXAMPLE. MONITORING HOW COMMUNITIES ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR CHRONIC DISEASE AFTER OF AFTER ACUTE EVENTS IS HELPING US TO PREDICT WHAT WE MIGHT SEE. IN COMMUNITIES AFTER NOON KNEW ABOUT SO EVERYTHING WE LEARNED ABOUT THE TROUT FOR EXAMPLE WE NOW HAVE IDEAS OF WHAT THINGS NEED TO BE IN PLACE. AND THEN WE CAN MEASURE THAT PROACTIVELY THROUGH A NEW EVENTS BUT REALLY IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE. I THINK WE'RE SORT OF THREE YEARS THREE TO FIVE YEARS FROM REALLY MAXIMIZING THE DATA THAT'S INTERIOR AVAILABLE. I'M SO THAT WE CAN. GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO TIE AT LEAST HEALTH A FAX. TO. THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENCY OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE. YOU IF WE CAN PROJECT WHAT WE THINK WE MIGHT SEE AND WE SEE LASSEN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS INVESTED A LOT IN RESILIENCE WE MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TIE SOME OF THAT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. DATA. AREAS THAT WE NEED TO BE. FOCUSING ON THAT WE MAY NOT BE. SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW AYE IN THESE QUESTIONS THAT THEY. ARE ASKED BY A TOOL MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT THEY ARE BE. YEAH AS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS MORE SPECIFICALLY. IT IN AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WHERE QUALITY IS POOR WE. HAVE NOW PUSH FORWARD THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE LOCAL IT QUITE DISTRICTS TO DO JUST A LITTLE MORE. RIGHT WITH THE ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SEVENTEEN. AM. BUT THEY'RE WANTING TO SEE HOW WE GOING DETERMINE YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THESE EFFORTS SO. SO. IN SOME WAYS AND AS FAR AS HEALTH OUTCOMES. AIR QUALITY IS ALMOST THE EASIEST TOO BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU SEE VERY IMMEDIATE EFFECTS SO WITH AS WITH AS MAY EXACERBATIONS BUT. ALSO AS WE BUILD OUT OUR ABILITY TO GET MY CLOSE TO REAL TIME INFORMATION FROM OUTPATIENT CLINICAL SETTINGS NOW WE CAN START LOOKING OUT. EXACERBATIONS VERB IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEART DISEASE FOR EXAMPLE. WE KNOW THE EFFECT IS A LARGE BUT WE HAVEN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE IT AND SO I THINK THAT AND THOSE ARE SPECIFIC VERY SPECIFIC TO PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE TYPE. EVENTS AND PATTERNS OVER TIME SO. IT IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY BOTH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTERS ARE OVER TIME. AND WE CAN MAP CERTAIN HEALTH INDICATORS SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS ETCETERA WE MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE MUCH GREATER INFORMATION AND MORE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON. WHAT INTERVENTIONS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING IN THOSE CAN IT IN THOSE SITUATIONS? THANK YOU OTHER THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. AS THIS CONVERSATION IS A VERY FRESH AND RELEVANT ONE THAT. AIR RESOURCES BOARD. CONSIDERING THE LEVEL OF TENSION AND INVESTMENTS. THAT WILL BE PUT INTO THIS PARTICULAR AREA. ANY CLOSING. COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS ON ON YOUR AND UNDERSECRETARIES. AND A WRAP UP THIS HEARING ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. NO I AMENDING THE MESSES THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT. ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND. BUT WE SHOULDN'T FEEL SATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MORE ANSWERS AND MORE YOU KNOW CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS. WE WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS ALL VERY NEW IS USE IS YOU SAID THIS IS THIS IS NEW WORK AND WE'RE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER SO. BEING AS HONEST AS WE CAN ABOUT. BEING OPEN TO CRITICISM AND EVALUATION IS IS IS HEALTHY AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AND. YOU KNOW I'D WE JUST APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT WE GET FROM. FROM LEGISLATURE AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN THE WORK THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING UP TO TO TO PUSH IT FURTHER SO. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN OUR DISTRICT ALONG NOT. EYES OF RELEASES SOLVENCY THAT INTERSECT WITH ALL OF THESE TOPICS THAT WE DISCOVERED TODAY. AT ENDING ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH NO I THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS RAISED. THE PROFILE OF THIS ISSUE. STATEWIDE IN HAS HELPED US MOVE THE NEEDLE ON SOME OF THE WEATHER BE POLICY. RELATED MATTERS WE WORKED ON OR FOR THAT MATTER THE FUNDING. COMPONENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE SECRETARY AS WELL. I THINK ANY THOUGHTS ON YOUR. NO I THINK I MEG KALE AND ECHO CAYLEY'S POINTS AND I THINK THE KEY IS IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT FUTURE AND WE KNOW THE FUTURE'S GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE PAST AND TODAY. BUT IS ALSO THAT WERE PLANNING DIFFERENTLY AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN HOW WERE COORDINATED AND WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS STATE AGENCIES BUT ALSO. ACROSS THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL AND WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AS WELL AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BECOME. EVEN MORE CRITICAL. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. SEARCHES OF AN ECHO THE AND THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS AT THE STATE HAVE AGENCIES WORK AS CLOSELY TOGETHER AS THEY DO. AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO EACH OTHER ON VARIOUS ASPECTS AND THAT REALLY IS MODELING I THINK FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO. SIMILARLY CREATE THESE KINDS OF CROSS SECTORAL COLLABORATIVE'S IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. KIND A RACE PROFILE ON THESE ISSUES. I THINK IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW ALONE AND THAT'S PROBABLY HEARING ON ITS OWN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE RECENT FIRES IN THE IMPACTS. SPECIFIC A PARTS OF THE STATE BUT. THE OVERALL IMPACTS IN THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE BRING BACK THE. SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BUT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE HEARING. AND THAT THIS TIME I'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO ADDRESS. THE COMMITTEE OF ONE TODAY. MA ALL EARS. THERE'S REALLY NOT A REASON TO SET A TIME LIMIT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE. SO PLEASE. STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION. AND. EXECUTIVE ADDRESS YOUR COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU. I KNOW I WILL BE. AND I CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND STAFF ARE RICO MUSTERED ANOTHER WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND TALKING ABOUT ADAPTATION I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THIS ISSUE. OF RESILIENCE AN ADAPTATION IS GETTING IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AT ALL SO BRINGS TO MIND THAT THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE DOING THROUGH THE BUDGET TO A TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE. INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT BY THE PANELISTS HAVING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STAND OUT TO ME FROM LISTENING TO THE PANELISTS THIS AFTERNOON. ARE. FIRST OF ALL THE INTERSECTION MENTALITY OF OF ALL THESE INVESTMENTS IN AND WHEN YOU. RESTORE YOUR FOREST'S YOU IMPROVE YOUR WATER SUPPLY WATER QUALITY AND. SPECIES DIVERSE CITY WHERE YOU GET A LOT OF BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I THINK WE WHEN WE LOOK AT INVESTMENTS. ON ANY KIND OF INVESTMENT REALLY BUT CERTAINLYCLIMATE INVESTMENTS THING EVERYONE OF THEM NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THROUGH A SOCIAL EQUITY LINES. WE'VE HEARD FROM YOU VIRTUALLY EVERYONE THAT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND MAKE INVESTMENTS ACCORDINGLY. AND. YOU KNOW THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC% LAND WORKS AND. BOTH AND WILD LANDSCAPES IN THE SIERRAS AND OTHER PLACES BUT WE DO A LOT OF WORK AND THE URBAN LANDSCAPE. AND WE KNOW WHEN YOU. YOU KNOW BUILD IN URBAN GREENING PROJECT AND. YOU KNOW YOU PICK THE PLACE BUT CLIMATE SOUTH LOS ANGELES COACHELLA. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ONLY REDUCING HEAT MITIGATION OR. HEAT ISLANDS WHICH I THINK ARE. THE MOST URGENT. SORT OF HEALTH IMPACT WE HAVE LOOKING AT OUR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND BUT YOU GET ALL THESE CALL BENEFITS AS WELL YOU KNOW YOU GET THE HEAT REDUCTION BUT YOU ALSO GET PERMEABLE PAVERS AND YOU GO OUT. CAPTURE STORM WATER YOU HAVE A PLACE TO WRECK RATE SO KIDS CAN BE YOU KNOW HAVE A HEALTHY YOU. OUTDOOR LIFE IN AND OUT BETTER CHANCE OF OF OF OF FLOM BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO I YOU KNOW I THINK NATURAL RESOURCE INVESTMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY AT LEAST THROUGH THE GDR AFGHAN. UNDER RESOURCE TO YOU NOW I THINK WE'VE GOT MAYBE TEN PERCENT OF THE GTR A FUNDS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF URGENCY TO TO. PIECE INVESTMENTS NOW WE CANNOT WAIT WE CAN. YOU KNOW THERE'S ARE THEREOF LITERALLY LIVES AT STAKE SO. AT ANY RATE I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR GREAT STAFF AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN. ABOUT PAUL MASON PACIFIC FOREST TRUST ALL ECHO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM TRUST FOR PUBLIC LANDS ACCOLADES IN APPRECIATION FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND IN THE BUDGET AND THE GOOD WORK OF YOUR STAFF ON ALL THE. SUPPORT WORK FOR ALL THOSE ACTIVITIES. I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK AROUND TWO WEEKS AND THEN A FAIR AMOUNT TIME EARLIER TALKING ABOUT WATER AND WATER AT THIS FOR THE CONSUMER AND OF THE SPECTRUM. BUT I THINK IT COULD BE TERRIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE START LOOKING OUT TO MID CENTURY AND LATER. TO BE. PLANNING NOW FOR THAT WATER IS GOING TO BE COMING FROM. BECAUSE AS YOU LOOK AT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKELY TO AFFECT CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING COULD BE HOTTER AND DRIER IN THE SOUTH STAY RELATIVELY SPEAKING. MOISTER AND RELATIVELY SPEAKING COOLER AND THE NORTH WHICH IS GOING TO REALLY. INCREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE WATERSHEDS IN THOSE SOURCE WATER AREAS WHERE SO MUCH OF THE. ON THE WATER THAT WE END UP UTILIZING FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOR URBAN USE FARTHER SOUTH. YOU KNOW COMES FROM OROVILLE SHASTA IN THE WATERSHEDS DEFEAT IN THERE AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SIERRA. AND AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. INVESTMENTS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THOSE WATERSHEDS BACK INTO THE SORT OF CONDITION WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IS GONNA REQUIRE FRANKLY THIRTY YEARS OF WORK TO GET THERE BECAUSE THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGES JUST SO. EXTENSIVE BUT IT PAYS A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIVIDENDS YOU MENTIONED. YOU KNOW THE. CONVERSATION WITH HUNGER ON FIRE AND FOREST CONDITIONS A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES AND. YOU KNOW FOR KATIE SAKE I WON'T TALK ABOUT THOSE TOO MUCH. RIGHT NOW BUT WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN OUR WATERSHED RESTORATION GOES BEYOND JUST WE NEED TO DO FOR OUR FORESTS IT'S ALSO RESTORING MEADOWS AND. STREAM CHANNELS AND REALLY TRYING TO GET US BACK TO THE. RESILIENT CONDITION WHERE WATER IS RELEASED FROM THOSE AREAS. LOOKING FARTHER OUT INTO THE SUMMERTIME AND MORE EVENLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE THESE BIG FLUSHES COMING DOWN FRANKLY RIGHT ABOUT NOW. AS WEARING THESE WARM DAYS BUT THAT WATER IS METERED OUT LATER INTO THE YEAR. THAT AMOUNTS TO CREATING AN. ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL STORAGE. FOR OUR WATER BECAUSE WATER COMING INTO OUR RESERVOIRS LATER INTO THE YEAR IS JUST AS GOOD IS HAVING A BIGGER RESERVOIR. AND SAW AS I WAS NOW LOOKING AT THE NEWS EARLIER I SAW. AND KNEW OP ED FROM SECRETARY LAIRD TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD ON STORAGE I WOULD JUST REALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT TO BE HAD IN THE WATERSHED RESTORATION. TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND IMPROVE TIMING. FOR WATER THERE. AND NOT SOLELY AND BUILD STORAGE. SO ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS COMMITTEE TO THEM OVER TIMES WE CAN ACTUALLY PLAN TO BE GETTING TO SCALE ACROSS MILLIONS OF ACRES CENTER AND PART OF OUR WATER SUPPLIES. SMEAR REALLY IMPORTANT. STEP TOWARDS GETTING. WORK DONE AT THE LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO OVER THE NEXT DECADE. CAPTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANONYMOUS BRANCH OF OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AGRICULTURE NETWORK. AND. SECTOR I JUST FIRST ONE OF THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR. LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND NOTE THAT PERSONALLY YOUR ELOQUENT DISCUSSION OF CLIMATE IMPACTS IN YOUR DISTRICT. WHETHER THE COURSE OF MANY HEARINGS LAST YEAR INSPIRED ME TO COME VISIT YOUR DISTRICT LAST DECEMBER. AND THERE'S REALLY NO. BETTER PLACE TO LOOK AT AND THINK ABOUT COMING IMPACTS THAN MARKING ON THE SALTON SEA. AND THINKING ABOUT THE WATER AND HE WAVED CHALLENGES THAT FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS NEAR DISTRICT FACE. SO APPRECIATE CONVENING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW FINDINGS FROM A RECENT STUDY THAT CAME OUT ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS A IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THIS WAS DONE BY FIVE YOU SEE PROFESSORS. AND. THERE'S A LOT BUT JUST A COUPLE. IT HIGHLIGHTS A WERE EXPECTING A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN SEVERE DROUGHTS BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. HEAT WAVES WE KNOW WILL DECREASE YIELDS AND TOMATOES FOR A RICE AND WINE GRAPES. I WILL ALSO EXPECT REDUCE QUALITY AND. STRAWBERRIES AND GRAPES IN TERMS OF THE FRUIT. AND THEN. MILDER WINTERS WILL INCREASE PASSED RANGING REPRODUCTION AFFECTING A NUMBER OF KEY CROPS IN THE STATE. SO THE REPORT ALSO HELPFULLY LISTS ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR A LOT OF THOSE CHALLENGES. BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THE PRACTICE IS FUNDED BY THE HEALTHY SOILS AND THE SWEET PROGRAM. ARE LISTED IN EVERYONE OF THE CATEGORIES OF CLIMATE IMPACT SINCE AND ASSOCIATED STRATEGIES. AND SO. I'D I JUST REALLY WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR AG RECOGNITION OF THAT NEXUS BETWEEN SWEEPING HEALTHY SWELLS. KINDA CHANGE IMPACTS NOTATION I IN YOUR FIGHTS FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE CABIN TRADE. PROGRAMS AND OF THE BOND OF THE DOLLARS. HE DID ASK ABOUT GAPS. IN SORT OF PLANNING. AND ONE THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT I'M IS TALKED ABOUT IN THAT REPORT THAT THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY STATE POLICY FOR. IS TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND. DO YOU BUSINESS PLANNING AND LAND SUCCESSION PLANNING. AROUND THE ISSUE OF CHANGING CROP AND. RANGES SO WE KNOW THAT COPS ARE GONNA GENTLY AFTER SHIFT NORTH. AND. SO FARMERS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO CHANGE. BOTH CROPS AND PRODUCTION METHODS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FOR FARMERS. ESPECIALLY THOSE LOOKING TO HER LIKE RETIRED THEY MADE THEY MAY END UP JUST DECIDING TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS AND SELL THEIR LAND OVERALL. AND THAT WOULD HAVE BIG LAND USE IMPACTS SO. I'M WE ARE INTERESTED IN A CONVERSATION AROUND HOW TO ASSIST THE PRIVATE SECTOR AG INDUSTRY IN. PLANNING FOR. SUCCESSION OF CROPS AND LAND. BUT THANK YOU OVER OFFICE. GOTTEN IN CHAIR AND. COMMITTEE STAFFS AND FOR OTHER OF ON THE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RELIEF. I MEAN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE IT REALLY KIND OF. VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED ALL THE REASONS WHY WE'RE ALL SUPPORTING. THIS DISCUSSION REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THE CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING. AND YOU KNOW FROM IRVING GRADING TERM FORESTRY TO WETLANDS RESTORATION EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THAT YOU'RE CHAMPIONING TO YOUR BUDGET REQUEST. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE THESE GROUPS YOU PREACH ACQUIRE MANY WAYS. BUT GETTING BACK TO THE QUESTION OF GAPS. THAT YOU RAISED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WITHIN THE RIBBON FOR CHIC. BUT THURMOND AND COMMUNITY FORCE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THROUGH LEADERSHIP OF. LEARNING GONZALEZ FLETCHER. UPDATING THAT URBAN FORESTRY ACT TO INCLUDE ALL THE THE DIVISIONAL COURT BENEFITS NOT JUST FOCUSED ON CARBON SEQUESTRATION BUT. THE STORM WATER CAPTURE AND IN THE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT ASPECTS OF URBAN FORESTRY IN URBAN GREENING. EVEN GOING TO SOME OF THE THE DISCUSSION AROUND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND HOW YOU YOU ENSURE THAT AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING DISCREET PROGRAMS MAKING IS GREAT INVESTMENTS. THE THE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT IS GOING TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY BUT EVEN BETTER WOULD BE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IT THEMSELVES. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW. THEY HOPE I'M ICED I MISS THE AGENCY DISCUSSION I HAD TO STEP UP A LITTLE BIT BUT. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THEY'RE CONSIDERING AND AND AND AND ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW AS YOU HEARD FROM CALIFORNIA RELIEF. DURING THE LAST HEARING. THERE IS A LOT OF COOL WORK BEING DONE ALREADY IF THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS ARE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ARE ARE BEING FULLY FLESHED OUT AND IMPLEMENTED. SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON HOT I MEAN I KNOW WITHOUT A BY CALIFORNIA SAME. AS MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE I WANNA ECHO EVERYTHING THAT MARK EVERY SPEAKER BEFORE ME HAD SAID OF. OUR ORGANIZATION REALLY WORKS ROUTE ACROSS THE STATE FROM EVERYWHERE FROM THE SOUND SEE ALL THE WAY TO YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND AND WETLANDS AT RESTORATION WITH FARMERS. TRYING TO. APPLY FOR A FARM FAMILY PRACTICES THAT I HAVE CO BENEFITS THAT ALLOW A BIRD POPULATIONS TO. ADAPT AND. HOPEFULLY SURVIVE THE AYE AYE CHENEY CLIMATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE WOULD. REALLY LIKE IT THE. NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN A AND WE'VE HAD SOME LEVEL OF DISCUSSION AROUND THIS IS THAT ARE HAVING AN INVENTORY OF LANDS A PUBLIC LINES TO SEE. HOW? THOSE AGENCIES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. IN MANAGING THEM ARE. ADAPTING. FOR. CHANGING CLIMATE AS WE AS WE START TO SEE OF THE POPULATION. AS WE SAW. IN ONE OF OUR RECENT STUDIES. THE HABITAT.
