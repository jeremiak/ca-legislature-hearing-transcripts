00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:46.858
ARE DEMONSTRATING VARIOUS

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:48.626
HIGHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS AND

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.595
I WANT TO WALK THROUGH THOSE.

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:53.031
VERY BRIEFLY. ONE EACH OF THE

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.866
CITIES IS FACING INCREASING

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.769
PENSION COSTS NOT ONLY THAT BUT

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:58.670
THESE PENSION COSTS ARE VERY

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:02.073
HIGH RELATIVE TO THE ANNUAL

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.441
REVENUES IN EACH CITY COLLECTS.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.076

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:20.625
SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW PROBLEMS

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:23.161
AN INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:23.862
PAY THEIR BILLS IN THE NEAR

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:26.998
TERM. RELATED TO THAT MANY OF

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.333
THESE CITIES HAVE INSUFFICIENT

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.535
FINANCIAL RESERVES THAT THEY

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:31.536
COULD USE TO FUND THEIR

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.104
OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.306
FISCAL EMERGENCY OR ANY KIND OF

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:38.276

CITIES THAT RANK VERY HIGH AS

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:11.215

THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ANYBODY'S

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.225

THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.342
BIG RED FLAG WE'VE NOT GONE

00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:27.077

TO CLEANING UP OUR NEIGHBOR. I

00:52:59.242 --> 00:52:59.743
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT IME AND

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:00.944
QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:01.578
LITTLE BIT LATE THAT WERE HERE.

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.446
ASKING FOR NOT A FEW YEARS

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.848
LATER IN. BY CERTAINLY

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.750
APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:10.387
CRISIS AS YOU DESCRIBED ITS-

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.254
CALIFORNIA'S PLANT.

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.222
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.124
CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEMS

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.292
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:17.227
ALSO CALIFORNIA'S FLINT RIGHT.

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:19.296
ARM ONE OF MY CONCERNS WE'VE

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:23.600
ALLOCATED- GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:25.569
FOR THIS CLEANUP WHEN. WHAT'S

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:28.471
THE STE. WASN'T EXCITED PAYING

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:29.940
FOR THIS CLEANUP. THEY ARE WHAT

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:31.441
WILL BE WILL BE I MEAN I'LL

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:32.142
I'LL GIVE YOU THE VERY HIGH

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.810
LEVEL UNDERSTANDING. THERE WAS

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.412
A NON PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.080
THAT WAS SIGNED BACK I BELIEVE

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.616
IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND- FIFTEEN.

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:42.185
THAT AT SOME POINT ONE FOUND

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:44.621
CULPABLE- THE X. EXCITE WOULD

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.890
BE RESPONSIBLE THE DOLLARS TO.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:47.857
BUT FOR THE DOLLARS OF CLEAN UP

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:48.825
IN WOULD REIMBURSE THE STATE

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.460
NOW IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:52.395
THERE THERE IS A SECOND. A IT

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:53.663
WAS A SECOND BILL TO ADDRESS

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.098
THAT ISSUE BUT AT THE END OF

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.232
THE DAY WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:58.368
RIGHT NOW IS CLEANING UP. WITH

00:53:58.435 --> 00:53:59.903
THE WITH THE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.138
ALLOCATED. AND I THINK THAT'S I

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:04.040
THINK THAT'S A VERY HIGH LEVEL-

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:05.275
YEAH BUT IF I CAN JUST ADD ON

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.843

WE'RE NOT GONNA ACCEPT THAT

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:32.035

00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:54.931
MEMBERS TO ADD ON- WITH THAT

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.532
WILL GO TO RETURN BACK TO THE

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.134
SANTIAGO IS ITEM I BELIEVE

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.070
SENATOR GONZALEZ HAS QUESTION

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:02.005
THEN MOVED TO CENTER ARTS FOR.

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:03.373
I MORE OF JUST A COMMENT I JUST

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:05.074
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU BOTH

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.009
FOR CONTINUING TO KEEP THE

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:09.012
ISSUE ALIVE I KNOW- FURNACE IN

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:10.546
MY BACKYARD AS WELL AND I'M

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:13.149
NEWER TO THE ISSUE BUT- WITH

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.751
ALL DUE. RESPECT THIS IS JUST

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:16.152
IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.888
CONTINUING THE DISCUSSIONS- I

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:21.824
THINK THE ONLY. QUESTION I HAD

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:24.494
WAS IT SAYS IT'S- THE TSC IS

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.528
UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW MANY

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.096
PARCELS WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.264
BE CLEANED UP EVEN AS A

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.565
LEGISLATOR I FEEL LIKE I CAN

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.000
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT DO WE

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.502
HAVE ANY GUESSTIMATES ON WHAT.

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:34.137
PERCENTAGE IS. CLEANED UP

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:37.674
ALREADY. YEAH SINCE THE CLEANUP

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.542
PLAN WAS ISSUED IN TWENTY

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:40.543
SEVENTEEN THE LATTER HALF OF

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.145
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE CLING OF

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:43.913
ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS.

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.548
THAT BRINGS THE ENTIRE AMOUNT A

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.550
NUMBER PARTIALS CLEANED UP TO

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.152
OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY.

00:59:49.218 --> 00:59:50.253
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AN

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.587
UNPRECEDENTED CLEAN UP IN THE

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:52.455
HISTORY THE STATE IN TERMS

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.190
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.959
TECHNIQUES TO BE DONE AS WELL

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:57.193
SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE SO THE

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.127
LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY PROVIDED

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.796
THE MONEY. SAID CLEAN UP

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:00.763
ACCORDING TO THE THREAT

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.298
REPRESENTED BY THE MATERIAL ON

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.500
THE PARTIALS. AND THE POTENTIAL

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.502
FOR ACTUALLY- THAT THAT HAS A

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:08.204
SUBSTANCE THE LEAD IMPACTING

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.640
HUMAN HEALTH. SO THERE'S NO SET

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.742
NUMBER OF PARCELS. THAT IS

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:15.244
ESTABLISHED IN LAW. WHAT WE

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.347
THINK WE CAN DO THAT BASICALLY

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:20.049
OUR ENGINEERS ESTIMATE SAYS.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:20.717
SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.884
AVERAGE PER PARTIALS ABOUT HOW

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.386
MUCH IT SHOULD COST WE'VE GOT

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.421
ONE CONTRACTORS SIXTY THOUSAND

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:26.055
ANOTHER CONTRACTOR OVER EIGHTY

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.790
THOUSAND. SO WE WERE STARTING

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:30.159
TO SHIFT MORE PROPERTIES TO THE

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.428
LOWER COST ONE. IN AN EFFORT TO

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:32.895
ACTUALLY CLEAN UP MORE

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:36.165
PROPERTIES OVER TIME. WITH WE

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:38.267
THINK WE CAN GET TO AROUND

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.204
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. BUT

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.339
THAT'S GONNA VERY A LOT ON THE

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:44.674
TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF ACTUAL

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.376
CLEANING UP INDIVIDUAL PARCELS

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.343
THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TAKEN

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.746
OUT OF EACH PARCEL IT THE WE

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:50.546

DOCUMENT FOR YOU. THERE'S A LOT

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:52.915
OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO EACH

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.617
INDIVIDUAL PARCEL ACTUALLY THE

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.786

I THINK AT THAT RATE AT WHICH

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.837
THE GROWTH IS HAPPENING. I WANT

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.272
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ASK THE

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:05.707

THOSE PRACTICES AND THEY WERE

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:16.551
NOT. THAT WE EARLY ON THE SIDE

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.852
OKAY THIS IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:19.220
BE YOU KNOW LET'S FIX IT. SO

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.088
THAT I CITIES ARE LOOKING TO

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.255
EACH OTHER TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:23.057

PRACTICES AND- YOU KNOW IF THE

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.070
CITIES ARE DOING THAT THEN THEY

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:37.205
CREATE A MODEL FOR OTHER

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:39.073
CITIES. ARE NOW QUICKLY LOOKING

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.341

WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.692
REGION AND I THINK THAT IT'S

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.927
IMPORTANT FOR US TO SIT DOWN.

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:56.330
FIRST WITH ME THEM MANY OF

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:57.598
THESE CITIES TO ENSURE THAT

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.500
WERE CAPTURING ALL. KIND OF

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:00.901
FEEL THAT THIS WAS YOU KNOW

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.102
SORT OF AN ARBITRARY LIKE WE'RE

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:03.837

TO AUDIT THAT MAKES ME FEEL AN

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.245
EASY. I'M BUT A QUESTION FOR

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:13.514
THE AUDITOR IS THERE WAS A AN

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.482
AUDIT THAT OCCURRED I THINK IT

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:18.152
WAS IT DIDN'T GET COMPLETED IN

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:19.153
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE CITY

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:21.021

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.756
MENTION IT WAS A REGARDING

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.358
FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:25.793
AND SORT OF A POTENTIAL HIGH

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:27.761
RISK IT DID MENTION CONTRACTING

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:29.897
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU. I DON'T

01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:31.799
KNOW WHERE THAT WS AT AND SO I

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:33.033
WANT TO KNOW WHERE THAT WAS AT

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.568
RELATIVE TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.770
WITH THIS AUDIT RIGHT AND I

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:37.905
MIGHT HAVE A MISTER TILDEN

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.740
ASSIST ME WITH THIS. BUT WHAT

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.709
WHAT THE CITY IS REFERRING TO

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:42.276
WHEN YOU WERE REFERRING TO

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.178
SENATOR IS WHEN WE WHEN WE

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:45.813
CONDUCT THE ANALYSIS THE HIGH

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:47.181
LEVEL ANALYSIS SAYS MR CHILDREN

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:49.583
WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER. AND

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:50.217
WE'RE LOOKING AT FISCAL

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.986
INDICATORS- YEAH- AS FAR AS YOU

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:55.122
KNOW ABILITY TO PAY THEIR BILLS

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.956
AND SHORT TERM LONG TERM DO

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:57.224
THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.092
RESERVE. AND OF THOSE

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.661
INDICATORS APPEAR TO US TO

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.896
SUGGEST THAT THE CITY IS UNDER

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.998
FISCAL. CONSTRAINT THEN WE WILL

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:07.267
GO OUT COCKED AN ASSESSMENT IT

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.602
IS NOT AN AUDIT WE DO NOT A

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.104
STATUTORY STODDARD AUTHORITY TO

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:13.273
RISK PROGRAM UNTIL THIS

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.509
COMMITTEE APPROVES IT SO WHAT

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:17.244
WE DID IS WE WENT OUT AND

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.345
CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:20.848
ESSENTIALLY WHAT AN ASSESSMENT

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:24.385
IS GOING OUT MEET. IF IT PULLS

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:26.620
IT DOING SO FOLKS LOOKING AT

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.922
SOME DOCUMENTS BUT ONE. THING

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.190
BUT IT WORKS WELL TEST CONTRA.

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:31.125
WE'RE NOT TESTING EXPENDITURES

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.059
THOSE ARE THINGS WERE JUST

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:34.862
HAVING. BILLY AKON. OUGHT TO

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:39.666
GET A FEEL FOR WHETHER OR NOT

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:40.501
WE THINK THE CITY HAS. PLUS

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.702
PLACE IF THERE IN IN OUR

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.573
OVER THERE EXPENDITURES ARE ARE

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.909
TOO HIGH EACH YEAR- SO. ONCE WE

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.477
COMPLETE THAT ASSESSMENT THEN

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:53.714
WE HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:54.348
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SUFFICIENT

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:55.616
CONCERN. TO COME TO THIS

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.418
COMMITTEE AND ASK FOR AN AUDIT.

01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:59.319
IN THE CASE OF HUNTINGTON PARK

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:00.487
WE DID THE ASSESSMENT. IT

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:02.623
COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES THAT

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:03.624
WE HAD LOOKED AT IT DIDN'T RISE

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.125
TO THE LEVEL OF SOMETHING WE

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.427
THOUGHT WE SHOULD COME TO THIS

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:07.895
COMMITTEE. SO WE MAY HAVE

01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:09.329
LOOKED AT CONTRA I'M SORRY I

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.465
DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS- WE

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:13.534
MAY HAVE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.636
THEIR CONTRACTING. DISS BUT WE

THAT THEY WANT TO AUDIT IT JUST

LIKE MOST OF THE OTHER

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:20.914
COMMITTEE SO I UNDERSTAND WHY

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:21.848
WAITING TO AUGUST WOULD BE A

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:24.651
DIFFICULT- I THINK WE CAN COME

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.553
TO MIDDLE GROUND- TO ADDRESS

01:50:26.619 --> 01:50:28.121

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.358
DON'T KNOW WHICH QUESTIONS TO

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:34.260
ASK IF I WENT TO A CITY- AND OR

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:36.663
WHEN I HAVE ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:38.965

GIVE YOU WILL- EXAMPLES OF WHY

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:54.280

CONDUCTED BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:58.018

01:50:58.084 --> 01:50:59.486
IN TERMS OF MEETING WITH THE

APPROVE AN AUDIT AND POSTPONE

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:04.791

FOR POSTPONING WOULD BE THAT-

01:51:26.913 --> 01:51:27.981
WE DON'T MEET ON A REGULAR

IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:04.417
DISCUSSION NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:06.719
THIS- FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT LET'S

01:52:06.786 --> 01:52:08.721
GO AHEAD AND I DIDN'T HEAR A

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:10.590
QUESTION THERE SO LET'S GO TO.

01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:13.193
PLEASE ATWATER SO IF THE

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:14.694
COMMITTEE APPROVES AND AGAIN

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.262
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS ALLEGE

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:18.198
COUNSEL TO ADVISE ON COMMITTEE

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:20.200
RULES BUT THE WHAT THE

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:22.802
COMMITTEE APPROVES TODAY- WOULD

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:23.870
BE THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THAT

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.672
WE WOULD DO- IF THERE'S

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:26.573
SOMETHING THAT COMES TO OUR

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:27.740
ATTENTION DURING THE COURSE OF

01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:28.875
THE AUDIT LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:30.810
THE PREVIOUS AUDIT ON ON TOXICS

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:31.744
WHERE WE WOULD LOOK AT COST

01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.279
RECOVERY IF SOMETHING CAME TO

01:52:33.346 --> 01:52:34.481
OUR ATTENTION WE COULD EXPAND

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:36.282
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT BUT WHAT

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.952
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO IS.

01:52:39.018 --> 01:52:40.720
IF THIS AUDIT GETS APPROVED-

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:42.322
PERHAPS IT'S DELAYED WE DON'T

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:43.890
START UNTIL JUNE THIS WOULD BE

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:45.925
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT NOW WE

01:52:45.992 --> 01:52:47.627
WOULD BENEFIT FROM IF THE CITY

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:48.962
BELIEVES THEY HAVE A LOT OF

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:50.730
ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS THAT

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.298
WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:53.199
IT WOULD TAKE US TO CONDUCT THE

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:55.168
AUDIT IT WOULD REDUCE THE COST

01:52:55.235 --> 01:52:56.870
OBVIOUSLY- BUT WE WOULDN'T

01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:59.038
NECESSARILY BE ENGAGING WITH MS

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:02.942
GARCIA- AS FAR AS OKAY THEY

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:03.710
CITY HAS TOLD US THIS DO YOU

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:04.911
HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:06.880
THAT NOT HOW THE PROCESS WORKS

01:53:06.946 --> 01:53:08.982
ONCE THIS. THIS PROPOSAL THAT

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.517
WE PUT TOGETHER ANALYSIS THAT

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:11.217
WE PUT TOGETHER FOR THE

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:15.155
COMMITTEE HAS APPROVED. THIS-BASICALLY DICTATES. THE WORK

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:16.723
THAT WE WOULD DO WE CERTAINLY

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.057
CAN DELAY COMMENCING THE AUDIT

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:20.193
AND AGAIN. IF THE CITY'S

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:22.395
RESPECTFULLY HAVE INFORMATION

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:24.430
THAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD.

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:25.798
CONVINCE US THAT ALL OF THESE

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.834
PROCESSES ARE TERRIFIC THEN WE

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.202
WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO WHEN WE

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:30.670
CONDUCTED NOT IF WE GET INTO AN

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:31.704
ENTITY AND WE SAY WE'RE GONNA

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:34.040
TEST THIRTY ITEMS. AND WE TEST

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:35.141
FIFTEEN WE FIND NO PROBLEMS

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.176
IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:37.944
WASTE TIME TESTING ANOTHER

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:38.912
FIFTEEN WE WANT TO KEEP THESE

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:40.079
AUDITS AS COST EFFECTIVE AS

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:42.015
POSSIBLE SO THAT'S THE APPROACH

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:43.416
WE WOULD TAKE IN CONDUCTING THE

01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:44.284
ON IT TRYING TO REDUCE THE

01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:45.919
AMOUNT OF. A COST BECAUSE WE

01:53:45.985 --> 01:53:47.787
ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO YOU KNOW

01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:49.489
THE EXPENSE OF THESE AUDITS ON

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:50.323
WE THINK THEY'RE VALUABLE

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:52.592
OBVIOUSLY- BUT THAT'S THAT'S

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:53.927
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE AUDITS

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:56.563
APPROVED THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY

01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:57.163
BE THE SCOPE OF THE WORK. THAT

01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:01.701
WE WOULD DO. CUT. YEAH AND

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:02.936
TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO IN

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:04.737
COMMITTEE IS- WILL WE MAKE THE

01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:06.339
MOTION WE WOULD ASK FOR A

01:54:06.406 --> 01:54:08.841
DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:09.442
STATE AUDITOR MOVING IN WHICH

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:12.145
WILL. MOST LIKELY DO WITH ONE

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:12.712
ANOTHER ITEM THAT'S ALREADY

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.147
BEEN AGREED TO LATER ON IN OUR

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:17.016
AGENDA. SO WITH THAT WE'RE

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:18.284
GOING TO MOVE TO CENTER BORE

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:21.087
JUST REPLACE THANK CHAIRMAN WAS

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:22.722
ANTICIPATING A COMMENTING ON

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.457
THIS BUT THERE. WERE IN THERE'S

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:26.092
BEEN A NUMBER OF ISSUES PUT

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:28.027
FORWARD THAT I THINK. HAS

01:54:28.094 --> 01:54:30.463
CAUSED ME TO QUESTION. THE ROLE

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.932
OF THIS BODY AND WHAT THE

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:35.168
APPROPRIATE PROCESS SEES ARE.

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:37.570
INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK THAT

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:40.707
AN AUDIT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:41.941
WHEN AT A COUPLE THINGS HAVE

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:44.344
ALREADY OCCURRED NAMELY THAT

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:47.847
INFORMATION SAW IT HAS NOT BEEN

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:50.650
PRODUCED. ANSWER QUESTIONS

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:54.320
POSED HAVE NOT ALLOWED FOR-

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:58.091
COMPETENT ANSWERS. OR A LAYER

01:54:58.157 --> 01:55:00.593
OF SURFACE- CERTAIN LAYERS OF

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.795
SOPHISTICATION ARE REQUIRED ON

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:06.933
THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE DOMAIN OF

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.068
A GIVEN LEGISLATIVE OFFICE I

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.737
THINK THAT'S ON THOSE ARE NOT

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:13.373
ON FAIR I THINK. PRESUMPTIONS

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:16.009
TO MAKE BEFORE IT ELEVATES TOOL

01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:17.944
FOR FULL FLEDGED USE OF

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:19.612
TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO REVIEW

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:22.215
SOMETHING IN IN DETAIL AND I

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:24.217
COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON

01:55:24.284 --> 01:55:27.153
BEFORE I- BEFORE I CAME TO THE

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:29.489
SENATE. AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:55:29.555 --> 01:55:31.157
IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.526
RESPECTING. IN GOING THROUGH A

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:36.029
PROCESS OF A WIN- CERTAIN

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:38.765
INDIVIDUALS REPRESENT AREAS

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:39.632
THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:44.070
SUBJECT OF AN AUDIT ON. NOT

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:45.305
JUST WITH THIS ISSUE I MEAN

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.706
THERE'S ONE THAT'S GONNA BE

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.741
COMING UP ON ITEM ONE OH TWO

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:50.543
THAT WE WERE ONLY RECENTLY MADE

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:54.080
AWARE OF ON THAT MY- THE AREA

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:55.481
THAT I REPRESENT WILL BE THE

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.550
SUBJECT OF AN AUDIT. I THINK WE

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.686
HEARD FROM THE SENATOR A MOMENT

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:00.753
AGO THAT SAID IT WOULD HAVE

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.355
BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:04.691
GOTTEN A HEADS UP AND MAYBE

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:05.525
QUESTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:08.161
POSED. PRIOR TO THAT IN ANSWERS

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:11.264
GOTTEN- SO I THINK THE WRIST

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:12.699
THERE'S A DUE PROCESS RESPECT

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.434
FACTOR THAT I THINK IS

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.735
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:17.503
OVERLOOKED. BUT ALSO GIVEN THE

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:19.272
FACT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:20.740
ELEVATE SOMETHING TO AN AUDIT

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:22.475
IT SAYS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:24.243
REQUESTING IT OR THE OFFICE

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:25.945
REQUESTING IT. WITH A GROUP OF

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:27.914
INDIVIDUALS REQUESTING IT THAT

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.282
THEY PUT FORWARD THE DUE

01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:32.118
DILIGENCE TO GET ANSWERS TO

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.986
THEIR QUESTIONS SPEAK WITH YOUR

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:35.555
WITH ALL PARTIES IN THIS IS A

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:37.790
CITY OR TWO. AND IF THEY CAN'T

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:40.126
GET IT THEN IT BATES WORE THE

01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:44.364
LAYER OVER THE AMOUNT OF CITY

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:46.065
CATION ON THE ISSUE REQUIRES

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:48.768
THE INVOCATION OF ODD THE

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:51.371
DEPARTMENT ON THOSE HERE SO

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:52.071
WITH THAT BEING SAID. I'M

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:55.074
SENSITIVE TO THE IDEA THAT-

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:57.143
THERE MIGHT BE A TIMING ISSUE

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:59.145
BUT BEAUSE IT THERE IS A DUE

01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:00.980
PROCESS THAT I THINK IS NOT

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.916
BEEN FOLLOWED HERE JUST YET THE

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:06.352
IDEA OF LAYING OUT. ON LIVE

01:57:06.419 --> 01:57:07.353
AGAIN SUMS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:12.492

IN ALL. IF THE DO YOU DILIGENCE

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:22.468
THAT SHOULD PUT FOR INTO INTO

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:23.669

WHICH WAS THE BROWN VERSUS PLOT

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:55.139
THAT CASE- WHAT'S- AB ONE

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.975
ANNISE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT. AS A

02:21:57.041 --> 02:21:57.675
STRATEGY TO REDUCE

02:21:57.742 --> 02:21:59.277

THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.561
WE HAVE TO ASK AN ADDRESS IS

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:18.897
HOW WE HAVE MOVED RESOURCES. ON

02:22:18.963 --> 02:22:20.098

SYSTEM FOR THAT VERY. REASON

02:22:32.176 --> 02:22:33.378

MOST PRESSING IN CLEAR CUT

AND IT'S EVEN NAME EVEN IN OUR

02:36:35.719 --> 02:36:38.255
OWN COMMITTEE PROCESS SO MY

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:41.258
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

TWO OF THE LEADERS ARE ALREADY

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:53.270
HERE IS THAT A REASONABLE

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:57.007
REQUEST I WOULD I THINK SO

02:36:57.074 --> 02:36:57.641
UNDER THE MICE YOU KNOW FOR MY

02:36:57.708 --> 02:37:00.511
STANDPOINT. AS WE WERE ASKING

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:01.011

02:37:01.078 --> 02:37:02.646
THOUSAND DOLLARS TWENTY SIX

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:04.948
HUNDRED WORK HOURS WORTH TWENTY

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:05.716
TWO HUNDRED HOURS WORTH OF

INVESTMENT. BINDING ON THE

02:37:08.786 --> 02:37:10.721
AUDIT DEPARTMENT I THINK IT

02:37:10.788 --> 02:37:12.790
NEEDS TO RISE TO A LEVEL THAT

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:14.958
EITHER. YOU'VE DONE THE DUE

02:37:15.025 --> 02:37:16.660

INFORMATION YOU WANTED OR THE

02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:19.863
LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IS JUST

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.832
TOO MUCH WHEN YOU NEED A THIRD

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:24.401
PARTY TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES.

02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:24.968
BUT I THINK HAVING NOT DONE

02:37:25.035 --> 02:37:28.071
THAT. I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:37:28.138 --> 02:37:30.374
EARLY PREMATURE MIGHT IN MY

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.408
OPINION AND RESPECTFULLY WOULD

02:37:31.475 --> 02:37:34.912

CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE

AUDITOR'S OFFICE SO IT WASN'T

02:45:29.286 --> 02:45:31.454
AS IF THIS OFFICE JUST DECIDED

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:32.155
TO ASK A BUNCH OF RANDOM

02:45:32.222 --> 02:45:34.691
QUESTIONS. WITHOUT SEEKING ANY

02:45:34.758 --> 02:45:35.959

LEAST AND WE HAVE SEEN AND

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:45.235
HEARD OF THE STRUGGLES THAT THE

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:47.170

THIS INFORMATION AND SO OFTEN

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:52.609
TIMES. IT'S NOT ABOUT RUBBER

02:45:52.676 --> 02:45:54.144
STAMPING BUT IT'S ABOUT

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:56.346
PROVIDING THE WEIGHT. AND THE

02:45:56.413 --> 02:45:59.115
OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE TO SAY

BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LEGISLATORS.

AND IT DID COME TO THIS BODY

02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:32.522
THAT'S THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT

02:50:32.589 --> 02:50:35.892
I THINK WE HAVE TO. AND HERE TO

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:38.294
IN ORDER TO BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR

02:50:38.361 --> 02:50:39.862
THAT THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:42.332
BEING REQUIRE ARE REQUESTED TO

OPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING. WAY

02:50:48.237 --> 02:50:51.240
PRIOR TO A NOTIFICATION OR WAY

02:50:51.307 --> 02:50:52.875
PRACTICE AS HAVING TO SIT

02:50:52.942 --> 02:50:55.979
THROUGH THIS. AND I REALLY AM.

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:59.649

02:51:01.184 --> 02:51:05.388
HAD THIS. REALLY SERIOUS UNDER

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:09.959
CURRENT OF DREAD THAT THIS BODY

02:51:10.026 --> 02:51:11.594
IS ALLOWING ITSELF TO BE

02:51:11.661 --> 02:51:14.831
POLITICIZED AND I WANT TO WARN

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:17.967
AGAINST THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF

02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:20.536
THIS GROUP IS AT STAKE I AM NOT

02:51:20.603 --> 02:51:21.904
SUGGESTING THAT WE DON'T DO

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:24.507
ANYTHING. WHAT I'M SUGGESTING

02:51:24.574 --> 02:51:26.943
IS THERE IS NO NECESSITY TO

02:51:27.010 --> 02:51:29.379
RUSH INTO THIS PARTICULARLY

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.914
GIVEN THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY OF

AT LEAST ONE AGENCY THAT HAS

02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:35.685
LEGITIMATE CLEAR INFORMATION

02:51:35.752 --> 02:51:37.353

TO HAVE TO VOTE NO ON THIS- BUT

02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:46.162
I DO THINK THAT IT IS A

02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:48.698
APPROPRIATE WARNING THAT OTHERS

02:51:48.765 --> 02:51:51.034
HAVE BEEN GIVEN HERE. THAT WE

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:53.102
HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:51:53.169 --> 02:51:54.804
AGENCIES THAT ARE COMING UNDER

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:56.506

02:51:56.572 --> 02:52:00.209
REQUEST. BE GIVEN A DUE PROCESS

02:52:00.276 --> 02:52:03.146
OPPORTUNITY OF ENOUGH TIME TO

AGO. SOME CAR PROGRAMS HAVE

03:19:46.708 --> 03:19:48.976
BEEN SCOPED INTO MULTI AGENCY

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:51.279
AUDITS BUT NOT A SIMILAR AUDIT

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:54.215
AS IT RELATES TO CARPET SO. IN

03:19:54.282 --> 03:19:54.849
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SENATE

COMMITTEE ATTEMPTED TO ASSESS

03:19:57.685 --> 03:19:59.520
THE COST IN GOLD THE VARIOUS

03:19:59.587 --> 03:20:01.255
CAR PROGRAMS BY THE END OF THE

03:20:01.322 --> 03:20:02.757
YEAR THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE

03:20:02.824 --> 03:20:04.859
ABLE TO DO SO TO JUST FIVE OF

03:20:04.926 --> 03:20:06.194
THOSE PROGRAMS. FOUR YEARS

03:20:06.260 --> 03:20:09.063
LATER THEY'RE STILL NOT BEEN AN

03:20:09.130 --> 03:20:11.065
OVER ARCHING REVIEW OF ALL

03:20:11.132 --> 03:20:13.067
THESE PROGRAMS AND THEIR

03:20:13.134 --> 03:20:16.137
AGGREGATED A FAX AS A RESULT.

03:20:16.204 --> 03:20:18.172
AND AS OF- THE LEGISLATIVE

03:20:18.239 --> 03:20:20.675
ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS TOLD US WE

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:22.777
DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE. A

03:20:22.844 --> 03:20:24.379
COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:27.749
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE VARIOUS

PROGRAMS AND AS LEGISLATORS I

03:20:29.317 --> 03:20:30.985
THINK WE WOULD ALL WANT TO KNOW

03:20:31.052 --> 03:20:32.520
THE ANSWERS TO THAT. THE

03:20:32.587 --> 03:20:33.955
REQUEST IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:20:34.021 --> 03:20:36.157
PUT THIS QUESTION TO BED ONCE

03:20:36.224 --> 03:20:38.359
AND FOR ALL A MOVE FOR WHAT A

03:20:38.426 --> 03:20:39.961
COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

03:20:40.027 --> 03:20:41.963
WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. THE

03:20:42.029 --> 03:20:43.664
ONLY GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA YOU

03:20:43.731 --> 03:20:45.366

03:20:45.433 --> 03:20:47.602
WE CAN ASSESS. THESE PROGRAMS

03:20:47.668 --> 03:20:49.237
BASED ON THE COST OF EACH

03:20:49.303 --> 03:20:51.973
METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE

03:20:52.039 --> 03:20:54.108
THE REDUCE. AND THAT MEASURE

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:56.077
VERY SIGNIFICANTLY SOME

03:20:56.144 --> 03:20:58.713
PROGRAMS COSTS. LESS IS HUNDRED

03:20:58.780 --> 03:21:00.114
ALL THE TIME WELL THERE'S OTHER

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:02.150
PROGRAMS IT'S COST AS MUCH AS

03:21:02.216 --> 03:21:03.017
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A TODD

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:05.086
AGAIN WE SHOULD WANT TO KNOW

03:21:05.153 --> 03:21:07.822
THOSE COST. BUT A FEW METRICS

03:21:07.889 --> 03:21:09.891
DOESN'T GET THE UNDERSTANDING

03:21:09.957 --> 03:21:12.927
TO THE QUESTIONS HERE. WHICH IS

03:21:12.994 --> 03:21:13.428
HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THESE

03:21:13.494 --> 03:21:15.396

RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATIVE

03:21:30.144 --> 03:21:32.013

THAT THE LA AUDIT REPORT IS

03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:07.601

AGENCY QUITE FRANKLY- AND- I

03:30:47.768 --> 03:30:50.170

SOAP BOX HERE BUT- I REPRESENT

03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:57.711
SOME OF SOME POOR COMMUNITIES

03:30:57.778 --> 03:30:59.546
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE

03:30:59.613 --> 03:31:01.148
DON'T QUALIFY UNDER YOUR AND

03:31:01.215 --> 03:31:02.816
YOUR DEFINITION OF ENVIRO OF

03:31:02.883 --> 03:31:03.951
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

03:31:04.018 --> 03:31:06.353
BECAUSE IN GENERAL MOST OF THE

03:31:06.420 --> 03:31:07.821
YEAR UNLESS WE HAVE A WILD FIRE

03:31:07.888 --> 03:31:08.922
WHICH YOU GUYS DON'T WANT TO

03:31:08.989 --> 03:31:11.992
MEASURE THAT BY THE WAY- WE

03:31:12.059 --> 03:31:14.728
DON'T WE HAVE CLEAN AIR WE ALSO

03:31:14.795 --> 03:31:16.597
HAVE CLEAN WATER BECAUSE WE

03:31:16.663 --> 03:31:17.231
SUPPLY WATER TO A HUGE PART OF

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:18.866
THE STATE. WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:31:18.932 --> 03:31:19.967
TREES AND THEY HAD TEND TO BE

03:31:20.034 --> 03:31:21.902
CARBON SINKS WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:31:21.969 --> 03:31:23.971
PEOPLE AND MARK COMMUNITY THAT

03:31:24.038 --> 03:31:26.440
ARE- THAT HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES

03:31:26.507 --> 03:31:28.342
THAT HAVE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS

03:31:28.409 --> 03:31:31.345
FOR TRACTORS FOR TRUCKS AND SO

03:31:31.412 --> 03:31:32.679
ONE AND THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR

03:31:32.746 --> 03:31:34.348
A LOT OF PROGRAMS AND OTHER

03:31:34.415 --> 03:31:35.315
PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES THAT

03:31:35.382 --> 03:31:36.850
PART THE STATE DO AND WE'RE

03:31:36.917 --> 03:31:39.887
LOOKING AT G. H. G. PRODUCTION

03:31:39.953 --> 03:31:42.322
AS A STATEWIDE ISSUE WHY ARE

03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:44.992
YOU GUYS DISADVANTAGED PUTTING

03:31:45.059 --> 03:31:46.326
OUR COMMUNITIES AT A

03:31:46.393 --> 03:31:48.328
DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE G. H. G.

03:31:48.395 --> 03:31:50.597
IS A G. H. G WORDS GENERATED

03:31:50.664 --> 03:31:52.499
IN. THROUGHOUT AND I THINK

03:31:52.566 --> 03:31:53.801
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S A

03:31:53.867 --> 03:31:56.170
DISSERVICE TO- TO A LOT OF US

03:31:56.236 --> 03:31:58.172
IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M

03:31:58.238 --> 03:31:59.473
NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS THIS

03:31:59.540 --> 03:32:01.208
WAY THE WHOLE COALITION OF

03:32:01.275 --> 03:32:03.477
FOLKS WITH THE BAY AREA- CAUCUS

03:32:03.544 --> 03:32:05.746
THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY AND I

03:32:05.813 --> 03:32:07.147
GET THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

03:32:07.214 --> 03:32:09.216
THE COMMUNITIES THAT MAYBE NEED

03:32:09.283 --> 03:32:11.485
SOME OF THIS THE MOST BUT- I

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:14.321
WOULD SAY THERE'S AN IN EQUITY

03:32:14.388 --> 03:32:17.758
FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WE

03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:18.859
GIVE AN EXAMPLE EVERYBODY FOR

03:32:18.926 --> 03:32:19.460
X. THAT RURAL COMMUNITY. IT'S

03:32:19.526 --> 03:32:21.228
THE TO LIVE IS LOW THEIR- IT'S

03:32:21.295 --> 03:32:23.097
NOT. THE WE HAVE TO TRY. BY

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:25.699
TRUCK. EVERYTHING INTO MY

03:32:25.766 --> 03:32:28.068
DISTRICT BECAUSE WE DON'T WE

03:32:28.135 --> 03:32:29.670
DON'T HAVE A REAL PORT THAT

03:32:29.736 --> 03:32:31.305
THAT BRINGS GOODSAND SERVICES

03:32:31.371 --> 03:32:33.574
AND SO WE ARE INFLUENCED BY THE

03:32:33.640 --> 03:32:36.610
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR SIX IT

03:32:36.677 --> 03:32:37.778
MAY NOT BE SO THAT THE AIR IS

03:32:37.845 --> 03:32:40.013
BROWN VISIBLY BROWN BUT WE ARE

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:43.150
INFLUENCED BY THAT. AND SO. YOU

03:32:43.217 --> 03:32:44.985
THERE IS A FRUSTRATION AND IN

03:32:45.052 --> 03:32:46.286
EQUITY PART OF THIS THAT

03:32:46.353 --> 03:32:49.256
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. AND IN IF

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:51.458

EVEN ESTIMATES BECAUSE THE

03:43:15.315 --> 03:43:17.117
BREADTH OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST.

03:43:17.183 --> 03:43:20.320

03:43:20.386 --> 03:43:22.989
FOUR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS.

BENEFITS IT'S A CO BENEFIT IS

03:43:49.115 --> 03:43:50.850
GOING TO BE PRETTY TECHNICALLY

03:43:50.917 --> 03:43:54.287
DIFFICULT- FOR AN AUDIT BUREAU.

03:43:54.354 --> 03:43:55.188
UNLESS YOU'RE BRINGING IN

03:43:55.255 --> 03:43:58.091

POLICY AT THE TRANSPORTATION

03:44:07.033 --> 03:44:09.035
POLICY. BUT I'D LIKE TO NOTE

03:44:09.102 --> 03:44:12.505
SOMETHING ELSE. RIGHT NOW. THIS

03:44:12.572 --> 03:44:15.809
IS MINUTES THIS THE TRUMP

03:44:15.875 --> 03:44:16.810
ADMINISTRATION. IS SPENDING AN

03:44:16.876 --> 03:44:20.413
AWFUL LOT OF TIME. IN OF IN

03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:21.514
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OIL AND

03:44:21.581 --> 03:44:23.183

03:44:25.985 --> 03:44:27.420
AUTOMAKERS THEY'RE SPENDING A

03:44:27.487 --> 03:44:28.555
LOT OF TIME GOING AFTER

03:44:28.621 --> 03:44:31.257
CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO CONTROL

03:44:31.324 --> 03:44:32.926
AIR POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES.

03:44:32.992 --> 03:44:35.028
AND THE WAIVER THAT ALLOWS

03:44:35.094 --> 03:44:38.198
THIS. STATE THE CONTROL IS HERE

03:44:38.264 --> 03:44:39.098
POLLUTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC

HEALTH IS BEING CHALLENGED. AND

03:44:42.735 --> 03:44:45.805
MY CONCERN IS THAT ONCE MORE

03:44:45.872 --> 03:44:48.708
WE'RE GOING TO BE PUT INTO A

03:44:48.775 --> 03:44:51.010

TALKING POINT BECAUSE THAT'S

03:45:09.996 --> 03:45:11.865
WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING. AND

03:45:11.931 --> 03:45:13.233
THIS IS NOT THE YEAR TO DO THIS

03:45:13.299 --> 03:45:15.501

03:47:03.476 --> 03:47:04.711
PROGRAMS THAT WERE SEEN FROM

03:47:04.777 --> 03:47:06.646
WASHINGTON DC OR THE STOP GAP

03:47:06.713 --> 03:47:07.714
MEASURES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

03:47:07.780 --> 03:47:09.949
PUT FORTH. SO AUDIT HELPS

03:47:10.016 --> 03:47:11.751
CONTINUE THE GREAT WORK THAT

03:47:11.818 --> 03:47:13.786
THIS AGENCY CLAIMS TO BE DOING

03:47:13.853 --> 03:47:15.221
BUT AGAIN I WANT TO SPEAK TO

03:47:15.288 --> 03:47:17.156

03:47:17.223 --> 03:47:19.759
ABOUT. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

03:47:19.826 --> 03:47:21.194
AN IMPACT TO COMMUNITIES

03:47:21.260 --> 03:47:22.729
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MONOLITHIC

03:47:22.795 --> 03:47:24.831
THEY DON'T LOOK ALIKE. AT I AM

03:47:24.897 --> 03:47:26.733
REALLY TIRED OF CARP TALKING

03:47:26.799 --> 03:47:28.501
ABOUT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHEN

03:47:28.568 --> 03:47:30.870
VERY FEW OF THOSE PROGRAMS EVER

03:47:30.937 --> 03:47:32.438
REACHED THOSE COMMUNITIES

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:33.673
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE MONEY

03:47:33.740 --> 03:47:36.609
IS BEING SPENT. AND I TOO WAS

03:47:36.676 --> 03:47:38.745
AT A CONFERENCE AND WE HEARD

03:47:38.811 --> 03:47:40.847
THE DIRECTOR STATE THAT. LOW

03:47:40.913 --> 03:47:42.582
INCOME PEOPLE WANT ZERO

03:47:42.648 --> 03:47:44.684
EMISSION VEHICLES. LOW INCOME

03:47:44.751 --> 03:47:46.452
PEOPLE WANT CLEAN AIR THEY WANT

03:47:46.519 --> 03:47:47.487
CLEAN WATER THEY WANT CLING

03:47:47.553 --> 03:47:48.921
SOIL BUT I'VE YET TO HEAR ONE

03:47:48.988 --> 03:47:50.656
SAY I WANTED ZERO EMISSION.

03:47:50.723 --> 03:47:53.126
VEHICLE THEY SAID I WANT A JOB

03:47:53.192 --> 03:47:55.028
SO IF THAT IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE

03:47:55.094 --> 03:47:56.195
WERE SEEING WERE IS THE DATA

03:47:56.262 --> 03:47:58.197
FROM THOSE SURVEYS THAT SAY

03:47:58.264 --> 03:47:59.499
THIS IS WHAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE

03:47:59.565 --> 03:48:01.401

03:48:05.004 --> 03:48:06.706
HEARD LOW INCOME FOLKS IN THE

03:48:06.773 --> 03:48:08.374
REASON I DRIVE MY TWENTY YEAR

03:48:08.441 --> 03:48:10.076

ALL. AND THEY WON'T FIT INTO A

03:48:15.214 --> 03:48:18.918
PRIUS. SO CONTINUE TO USE POOR

03:48:18.985 --> 03:48:20.553

04:30:10.561 --> 04:30:11.228
IT HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE KEY

04:30:11.295 --> 04:30:12.996
ISSUES WORK THAT WE IDENTIFIED

04:30:13.063 --> 04:30:15.065
AND WHY WE STILL BELIEVE THAT

04:30:15.132 --> 04:30:16.600
IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR.

04:30:16.667 --> 04:30:18.569
THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE NOT

04:30:18.635 --> 04:30:22.005

04:30:22.072 --> 04:30:22.573
AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

04:30:23.206 --> 04:30:23.707
THE RECORD MY NAME IS. STILL

04:30:23.774 --> 04:30:26.343
NOT. PARTNER SO IS MISS HOW

04:30:26.410 --> 04:30:28.378
INDICATED WE ANALYZE THE CITY

04:30:28.445 --> 04:30:29.580
LYNSEY'S FINANCES WHEN WE

04:30:29.646 --> 04:30:30.747
ISSUED OUR DASHBOARD AND WE

04:30:30.814 --> 04:30:31.615
DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE THE

04:30:31.682 --> 04:30:33.483
FOURTH. MOST FISCALLY

04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:35.485
CHALLENGED CITY IN THE STATE

04:30:35.552 --> 04:30:36.019
AND ESSENTIALLY THAT WAS

04:30:36.086 --> 04:30:37.888
BECAUSE- THEY ARE HAVING

04:30:37.955 --> 04:30:39.222
DIFFICULTIES IN TERMS OF THEIR

04:30:39.289 --> 04:30:41.158
CASH POSITION AND RESERVE TO

04:30:41.224 --> 04:30:42.926
PAY THEIR BILLS. AND THEY ALSO

04:30:42.993 --> 04:30:43.894
HAVE INCREASING RETIREMENT

04:30:43.961 --> 04:30:46.096
COSTS. SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE

04:30:46.163 --> 04:30:47.397
IS THEY'VE BASICALLY BEEN

04:30:47.464 --> 04:30:51.802
INCURRING- REGULAR OPERATING

04:30:51.868 --> 04:30:52.836
LOSSES AND SEVERAL OF THEIR FOR.

04:30:52.903 --> 04:30:53.570
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THEY- IS

04:30:53.637 --> 04:30:55.973
THAT THE GENERAL FUND HAS LOAN

04:30:56.039 --> 04:30:56.707
SAID STANGEL AMOUNTS OF MONEY

04:30:56.773 --> 04:30:58.141
TO OTHER FUNDS INCLUDING

04:30:58.208 --> 04:30:59.776
SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO

04:30:59.843 --> 04:31:00.844
ANOTHER FUND TO BUILD AN INDOOR

04:31:00.911 --> 04:31:03.113
SPORTS COMPLEX. BECAUSE THAT

04:31:03.180 --> 04:31:04.181
COMPLEX DIDN'T GENERATE ENOUGH

04:31:04.247 --> 04:31:05.616
REVENUE TO BASICALLY TO PAY THE

04:31:05.682 --> 04:31:07.651
LOAN OFF. CITY COUNCIL FOR GAVE

04:31:07.718 --> 04:31:09.820
THAT LOAN WHICH RESULT IN A

04:31:09.886 --> 04:31:10.988
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL HIT THE

04:31:11.054 --> 04:31:13.256
GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE OF THAT

04:31:13.323 --> 04:31:14.591
AT THE OPERATING LOSSES THE

04:31:14.658 --> 04:31:16.526
LOANS THAT WERE WRITTEN OFF.

04:31:16.593 --> 04:31:18.261
THE CITY WHEN'S THE GENERAL HAS

04:31:18.328 --> 04:31:20.364
A VERY SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT.

04:31:20.430 --> 04:31:21.632
GENERAL RESERVES. I AND FROM WE

04:31:21.698 --> 04:31:23.600
TO THE DASHBOARD THE CITY OF

04:31:23.667 --> 04:31:26.603
LINDSEY'S. NEGATIVE FIVE.

04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:28.238
GENERAL FUND RESERVE WAS THE

04:31:28.305 --> 04:31:30.974
SECOND LARGEST IN. THE ENTIRE

04:31:31.041 --> 04:31:31.975
STATE AT NINE POINT FOUR

04:31:32.042 --> 04:31:34.478
MILLION. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES

04:31:34.544 --> 04:31:35.278
THIS THESE EXTERNAL HAS A-

04:31:35.345 --> 04:31:37.981
GOING. ABOUT AND BASICALLY HAS

04:31:38.048 --> 04:31:40.250
SAID THE CITY HAS SUBSTANTIAL

04:31:40.317 --> 04:31:43.120
DOUBT ABOUT THE CITY'S ABILITY

04:31:43.186 --> 04:31:45.222
TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.

04:31:45.288 --> 04:31:46.823
IN THE MOST RECENT AUTO REPORT

04:31:46.890 --> 04:31:48.225
THE ORDER WENT SO FAR AS TO

04:31:48.291 --> 04:31:49.693
CALL THE CITY FUNCTIONALLY

04:31:49.760 --> 04:31:52.429
BANKRUPT- SO WE HAVE A NUMBER

04:31:52.496 --> 04:31:54.398
OF DIFFERENT- AUDIT OBJECTIVES

04:31:54.464 --> 04:31:55.666
BUT TO KEEP IT BRIEF

04:31:55.732 --> 04:31:57.567
ESSENTIALLY IF THE AUDIT IS

04:31:57.634 --> 04:31:59.770
APPROVED- THAT WOULD GIVE US AN

04:31:59.836 --> 04:32:01.638
OPPORTUNITY TO DO A DEEPER DIVE

04:32:01.705 --> 04:32:03.573
AND REALLY- PUT TOGETHER A FULL

04:32:03.640 --> 04:32:04.808
ACCOUNTING OF THE CITY'S

04:32:04.875 --> 04:32:06.476
FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL

04:32:06.543 --> 04:32:08.545
MANAGEMENT RISKS. AND MORE

04:32:08.612 --> 04:32:09.713
IMPORTANTLY WE GIVE US AN

04:32:09.780 --> 04:32:11.114
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE DETAILED

04:32:11.181 --> 04:32:12.849
AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

04:32:12.916 --> 04:32:14.451
TO THE CITY THAT WOULD ALLOW

04:32:14.518 --> 04:32:15.419
THEM TO CREATE A CORRECTIVE

04:32:15.485 --> 04:32:17.954
ACTION PLAN ESSENTIALLY TO

04:32:18.021 --> 04:32:20.123
ADDRESS THE FINDINGS. AND WE

04:32:20.190 --> 04:32:21.358
HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE ART IT

04:32:21.425 --> 04:32:24.061
WOULD TAKE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND

04:32:24.127 --> 04:32:24.661
NINE HUNDRED NINETY SIX HOURS

04:32:24.728 --> 04:32:25.729
TO COMPLETE. AND THAT WOULD

04:32:25.796 --> 04:32:27.197
EQUATE TO ROUGHLY FOUR FIVE

04:32:27.264 --> 04:32:33.036
MONTHS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

FINANCES. AS A SMALL VERY

04:32:56.993 --> 04:32:59.596
DISADVANTAGED. OF AG BASED

04:32:59.663 --> 04:33:01.064
COMMUNITY WE HAVE BUILT MOSTLY

04:33:01.131 --> 04:33:03.700
ALONE AND- DEALING WITH OUR

04:33:03.767 --> 04:33:07.571
WITH OUR DEEP CHALLENGES. AND

04:33:07.637 --> 04:33:10.741
THEY'VE GONE BACK FOR DECADES-

04:33:10.807 --> 04:33:12.275
WE ARE IN THE CITRUS SPELLED WE

04:33:12.342 --> 04:33:13.844
FACED A NUMBER OF DEVASTATING

04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:15.946
FREEZES WE'VE HAD BUSINESSES

04:33:16.012 --> 04:33:18.281
CLOSE AND LEAVE WE- ARE

04:33:18.348 --> 04:33:21.585
POPULATION IS PRIMARILY-

04:33:21.651 --> 04:33:25.155
HISPANIC FARM WORKER. WE HAVE

04:33:25.222 --> 04:33:27.124
LOW GROWTH THERE'S A FEW WAYS

04:33:27.190 --> 04:33:29.226
TO RAISE FUNDS IN OUR IN OUR

04:33:29.292 --> 04:33:32.262
COMMUNITY BUT- WE DON'T THINK

04:33:32.329 --> 04:33:33.530
OUR STRUGGLES ARE THAT UNIQUE

04:33:33.597 --> 04:33:35.198
TO US THEIR SHARED BY MOST

04:33:35.265 --> 04:33:37.100
CITIES IN OUR AREA WITH THE

04:33:37.167 --> 04:33:38.969
EXCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT WE

04:33:39.035 --> 04:33:41.772
DID. HAVE A MAJOR EFFORT

04:33:41.838 --> 04:33:44.274
UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO RISE ABOVE

04:33:44.341 --> 04:33:46.443
OUR POVERTY. ABOUT FIFTEEN

04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:50.347
YEARS AGO IN CREATING THIS.

04:33:50.413 --> 04:33:51.882
REGIONAL SPORTS AND RECREATION

04:33:51.948 --> 04:33:53.550
FACILITY IN AN OLD ABANDONED

04:33:53.617 --> 04:33:55.952
PACKING HOMES. AND AT THE SAME

04:33:56.019 --> 04:33:57.320
TIME WE DID DOWNTOWN

04:33:57.387 --> 04:33:59.222
IMPROVEMENTS TRYING TO INVITE.

04:33:59.289 --> 04:34:01.725
PEOPLE BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY-

04:34:01.792 --> 04:34:02.859
FOR VARIOUS REASONS THIS MAJOR

04:34:02.926 --> 04:34:08.598
EFFORT. WAS DID FAIL- SOME OF

04:34:08.665 --> 04:34:10.367
THEM ARE CALDERON WEAKNESSES

04:34:10.433 --> 04:34:11.234
AND SOME OF THEM WERE THINGS

04:34:11.301 --> 04:34:12.402
LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION THAT

04:34:12.469 --> 04:34:14.504
HIT OUR AREA VERY HARD AND WE

04:34:14.571 --> 04:34:15.405
WERE A LONG TIME CLIMBING OUT

04:34:15.472 --> 04:34:17.808
OF. OF THE RE SENDING A

04:34:17.874 --> 04:34:19.242
REDEVELOPMENT WHICH WE HAD

04:34:19.309 --> 04:34:21.611
RELIED UPON AND THINGS LIKE

04:34:21.678 --> 04:34:22.746
THAT THAT WERE SOMEONE OUT OF

04:34:22.813 --> 04:34:24.080
OUR CONTROL BUT IT LEFT US WITH

04:34:24.147 --> 04:34:27.951
A BIG HOLE ULTIMATELY- WHICH WE

04:34:28.018 --> 04:34:30.520
HAVE ADMITTED TO IN OUR GENERAL

04:34:30.587 --> 04:34:32.556
FUND. AND I BELIEVE MADE THE

04:34:32.622 --> 04:34:34.925
RIGHT DECISION IN. FORGIVING

04:34:34.991 --> 04:34:36.159
ORLEANS TO OURSELVES SO THAT WE

04:34:36.226 --> 04:34:38.428
CAN MOVE FORWARD WE BELIEVE

04:34:38.495 --> 04:34:40.230
THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION WE

04:34:40.297 --> 04:34:41.998
HAVE OTHER HELLO THAT WE'VE HAD

04:34:42.065 --> 04:34:46.636
TO. PAY BACK ON SOME GRANTS

04:34:46.703 --> 04:34:47.337
THAT WERE DEEMED BY THE STATE

04:34:47.404 --> 04:34:49.139
TO BE. NOT PROPERLY

04:34:49.206 --> 04:34:51.474
ADMINISTERED AND WE HAVE WORKED

04:34:51.541 --> 04:34:52.709
THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AS WELL

04:34:52.776 --> 04:34:53.977
AND MAYES SETTLEMENTS ARE A

04:34:54.044 --> 04:34:55.712
REALLY CLOSE TO SETTLING WITH.

04:34:55.779 --> 04:34:57.314
IN AND ALL OF THOSE INSTANCES

04:34:57.380 --> 04:34:59.449
SO WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE. TAKEN

04:34:59.516 --> 04:35:01.384
THE STEPS WE NEED TO CLIMB OUT

04:35:01.451 --> 04:35:03.019
OF THIS SITUATION WE HAVE

04:35:03.086 --> 04:35:04.654
MANAGED TO AVOID BANKRUPTCY

04:35:04.721 --> 04:35:06.089
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S

04:35:06.156 --> 04:35:07.757
BEEN HARD WORK WE'VE DONE.

04:35:07.824 --> 04:35:09.693
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE MADE CUTS

04:35:09.759 --> 04:35:11.695
TO THE BONE WE HAVE RAISED

04:35:11.761 --> 04:35:13.697
REVENUES THROUGH A ONE CENT

04:35:13.763 --> 04:35:16.733
SALES TAX THAT WE WERE.

04:35:16.800 --> 04:35:19.369
SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING. ON BUT

04:35:19.436 --> 04:35:21.071
WE ARE A POOR COMMUNITY AND

04:35:21.137 --> 04:35:22.138
THERE'S LIMITS TO REVENUES THAT

04:35:22.205 --> 04:35:24.507
WE CAN REYES AND THERE'S LIMITS

04:35:24.574 --> 04:35:25.909
TO SERVICES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

04:35:25.976 --> 04:35:29.145
SO BUT WE FEEL WE MOVED IN THE

04:35:29.212 --> 04:35:31.381
RIGHT DIRECTION WE DON'T

04:35:31.448 --> 04:35:33.583
DISPUTE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE

04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:35.051
AUDITOR'S REPORT NECESSARILY

04:35:35.118 --> 04:35:37.888
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THAT V. I

04:35:37.954 --> 04:35:40.090
REQUEST LETTER DOES NOT

04:35:40.156 --> 04:35:40.824
ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR CURRENT

04:35:40.891 --> 04:35:44.094
SITUATION AND EFFORTS THAT WE

04:35:44.160 --> 04:35:46.997
HAVE MADE. THE PAST WE THINK

04:35:47.063 --> 04:35:48.298
WE'VE OVERCOME BUT WE HAVE MANY

04:35:48.365 --> 04:35:51.268
CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE WE

04:35:51.334 --> 04:35:51.868
HAVE MANY NEEDS FOR THE FUTURE

04:35:51.935 --> 04:35:53.003
THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE

04:35:53.069 --> 04:35:54.771
GOING TO MEET SO WE'RE STILL IN

04:35:54.838 --> 04:35:56.473
A PRECARIOUS SITUATION. FOR

04:35:56.539 --> 04:35:57.340
EXAMPLE OUR WATER

04:35:57.407 --> 04:35:59.776
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A BIG CONCERN

04:35:59.843 --> 04:36:02.212
FOR US THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED

04:36:02.279 --> 04:36:03.780
A NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT FOR

04:36:03.847 --> 04:36:05.148
EXAMPLE AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO

04:36:05.215 --> 04:36:09.119
FIND IT- STIGMA IS EVEN A BIG

04:36:09.185 --> 04:36:10.186
BURDEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

04:36:10.253 --> 04:36:13.356
HOW TO. PAY FOR PLANS THAT WILL

04:36:13.423 --> 04:36:15.125
ULTIMATELY HURT OUR AG ECONOMY

04:36:15.191 --> 04:36:17.761
AND THOSE ARE ON CITY FINANCES.

04:36:17.827 --> 04:36:19.562
SO IT'S THINGS LIKE THIS OF

04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:24.334
DESERT AREA STRUCK THE SHOWING

04:36:24.401 --> 04:36:26.903
WITH ADEQUATELY STAFFING PUBLIC

04:36:26.970 --> 04:36:29.906
SAFETY DEPARTMENTS. WE DO THE

04:36:29.973 --> 04:36:32.409
BEST WE CAN WE OUT OF NECESSITY

04:36:32.475 --> 04:36:34.544
COMBINED POLICE AND FIRE AND

04:36:34.611 --> 04:36:36.846
CROSS TRAIN THOSE OFFICERS JUST

04:36:36.913 --> 04:36:39.082
SO THAT WE COULD HANDLE THESE

04:36:39.149 --> 04:36:42.018

IDEAS ON HOW TO DO THINGS

BETTER THANK GOD I THINK-

04:36:47.824 --> 04:36:49.693
THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE HEAR

04:36:49.759 --> 04:36:50.927
ABOUT AS WELL AS WE FIND BEST

04:36:50.994 --> 04:36:52.462
PRACTICES. SO THE STATE

04:36:52.529 --> 04:36:54.397
AUDITOR'S LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF

04:36:54.464 --> 04:36:55.098
CITIES ALREADY UNDER THE HIGH

04:36:55.165 --> 04:36:57.801
RISK SO PERHAPS IT. IDEAS THERE

04:36:57.867 --> 04:37:00.236
THAT MIGHT BENEFIT THE CITY OF

04:37:00.303 --> 04:37:01.871
LINDSAY AND ONE OF THE THINGS

04:37:01.938 --> 04:37:02.505
ABOUT HAVING AN AUDITOR GOODWIN

04:37:02.572 --> 04:37:03.807
IS LOOK AT SEE WHAT CITY OF

04:37:03.873 --> 04:37:05.241
LINDSAY FOR INSTANCE IN THIS

04:37:05.308 --> 04:37:08.078
CASE IS DOING SAYING OUR FAXES

04:37:08.144 --> 04:37:10.146
MADE ANOTHER SMALL CITY OR CITY

04:37:10.213 --> 04:37:11.414
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ACTUAL

04:37:11.481 --> 04:37:13.416
SOMETHING MAYBE YOU MIGHT NOT

04:37:13.483 --> 04:37:14.918

FINANCE MECHANISM. HELPED A OUT.

04:37:20.457 --> 04:37:22.659

04:37:22.726 --> 04:37:23.960
IF YOU WANT TO HONOR WE HOPE

04:37:24.027 --> 04:37:24.995

REVIEWED YOUR KAFIRS. AND JUST

04:37:56.326 --> 04:37:58.628
DID A SIMPLE METRIC AND- THE

04:37:58.695 --> 04:38:00.730
STATE AUDITOR HAS HER OWN DEEP

04:38:00.797 --> 04:38:02.732
DIVE SHE LOOKS AT ABOUT TEN

04:38:02.799 --> 04:38:05.235
CRITERIA I ONLY LOOK AT ONE-

04:38:05.301 --> 04:38:06.169
AND THAT IS YOUR OWN RESTRICTED

04:38:06.236 --> 04:38:08.171
NEXT POSITION WHICH CURRENTLY

04:38:08.238 --> 04:38:12.075
IS A DEFICIT- BUT I DIVIDE THAT

04:38:12.142 --> 04:38:15.345
BY YOUR POPULATION. AND OF THE

04:38:15.412 --> 04:38:17.781
FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES-

04:38:17.847 --> 04:38:21.084
YOUR IN- THREE HUNDRED AND

04:38:21.151 --> 04:38:22.685
THIRTY ONE. THAT'S FOR YOUR

04:38:22.752 --> 04:38:24.554
RANK TO THE OTHER CITIES AT

04:38:24.621 --> 04:38:26.656
TODAY THE OTHER FOUR ARE

04:38:26.723 --> 04:38:29.392
ACTUALLY IN WORSE SHAPE. THAN

04:38:29.459 --> 04:38:34.364
YOU ARE BASED ON MY METRICS.

04:38:34.431 --> 04:38:38.168
BLYTH IS AT THREE SEVENTY SIX

FIVE FIVE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

04:38:49.279 --> 04:38:52.749
CITIES. IN YOUR POSITION AND

04:38:52.816 --> 04:38:54.551
WORSE AND SO YOU CAN LOOK AT

04:38:54.617 --> 04:38:56.052
ALL THE OTHER CITIES AND HOW

04:38:56.119 --> 04:38:59.456
THEY RANK ON MY WEBSITE. BUT

04:38:59.522 --> 04:39:01.891
IT'S SYSTEMIC OF WHAT'S GOING

04:39:01.958 --> 04:39:03.626
ON IN THE STATE AND IT'S BEEN

04:39:03.693 --> 04:39:05.361
FRUSTRATING FOR ME MISTER CHAIR

04:39:05.428 --> 04:39:07.897
AS A SENATOR IN THE LEGISLATURE

04:39:07.964 --> 04:39:09.432
THAT WERE SET NOT TWENTY ONE

04:39:09.499 --> 04:39:10.900
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE SURPLUS.

04:39:10.967 --> 04:39:12.635
IN OUR CITIES HAVE NO WAY OF

04:39:12.702 --> 04:39:14.704
RAISING REVENUES YOU CAN'T

04:39:14.771 --> 04:39:16.473
TOUCH THE PROPERTY TAX YOU

04:39:16.539 --> 04:39:17.707
COULD TRY DO AN ASSESSMENT OR

04:39:17.774 --> 04:39:19.609
PARTIAL TO ACT YOU CAN DO A

04:39:19.676 --> 04:39:21.010
SALES TAX INCREASE BUT WE'VE

04:39:21.077 --> 04:39:21.711
GOT CITIES COMING HERE ASKING

04:39:21.778 --> 04:39:24.447
TO GO WELL BEYOND THE 2% THAT.

04:39:24.514 --> 04:39:26.483
WE CAP THE MAT SO- THE DESERT

04:39:26.549 --> 04:39:28.284
RELISHING TIMES FOR OUR CITIES

04:39:28.351 --> 04:39:30.520
AND OUR COUNTIES- OUR SCHOOL

04:39:30.587 --> 04:39:31.855
DISTRICTS THAT DON'T EVEN GET

04:39:32.722 --> 04:39:34.791
AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

04:39:34.858 --> 04:39:38.995
BUT- I'M JUST CURIOUS AS HOW-

04:39:39.062 --> 04:39:40.897
HOW MANY OF THESE TYPES OF

04:39:40.964 --> 04:39:43.633
AUDITS HAVE YOU DONE. HIGHER

04:39:43.700 --> 04:39:45.368
YEARS FOR CITIES. IN A AND

04:39:45.435 --> 04:39:48.404

WERE THE CITY OF HAMILTON CITY

04:40:05.788 --> 04:40:07.357
MAY WOULD. THEN WE ALSO LOOKED

04:40:07.423 --> 04:40:08.925
AT THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO AND

04:40:08.992 --> 04:40:10.860

WITH RESPECT TO- OPPORTUNITIES

04:40:18.601 --> 04:40:19.869
TO RAISE REVENUE AREAS WHERE

04:40:19.936 --> 04:40:23.439
THEY CAN CUT COSTS- LOOKING FOR

04:40:23.506 --> 04:40:24.874
EFFICIENCIES HELPING THEM WITH

04:40:24.941 --> 04:40:26.409
JUST. BASIC MANAGEMENT

04:40:26.476 --> 04:40:28.678
PRACTICES INTERNAL CONTROLS THE

04:40:28.745 --> 04:40:31.047
BASIC FUNDAMENTALS ARE AND NO

04:40:31.114 --> 04:40:32.315
DISRESPECT TO THE C. ANY THE

04:40:49.732 --> 04:40:51.034
BACKGROUND SO WE THINK WE

04:40:51.100 --> 04:40:52.502

COLLATERAL FOR THE LOAN FOR TEN

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN RESPONSE

05:09:20.942 --> 05:09:23.578
TO. THESE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

05:09:23.645 --> 05:09:25.446
THE CITY'S EXTERNAL AUDITOR HAS

05:09:25.513 --> 05:09:26.581
EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS

05:09:26.648 --> 05:09:28.216
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE CITY'S

05:09:28.283 --> 05:09:30.018
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WITH

05:09:30.084 --> 05:09:32.420
ITS CONSTITUENTS OUR ABILITY TO

05:09:32.487 --> 05:09:34.422
CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.

05:09:34.489 --> 05:09:35.823
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

05:09:35.890 --> 05:09:37.325
CITY'S RESPONSE TO THAT IS THEY

05:09:37.392 --> 05:09:39.260
ARE RELYING ON THE VOTERS TO

05:09:39.327 --> 05:09:41.562
PASS. A NEW TAX MEASURE NEXT

05:09:41.629 --> 05:09:43.698
MONTH AND ALSO RECEIVING

05:09:43.765 --> 05:09:44.966
INCREASE REVENUE FROM A NEW

05:09:45.033 --> 05:09:46.734
HOTEL THAT'S IN THE PROCESS OF

05:09:46.801 --> 05:09:48.636
BEING BUILT. SO BASED ON THAT

05:09:48.703 --> 05:09:49.938
WE LOOKED AT THE CITY'S

05:09:50.004 --> 05:09:51.806
HISTORIC REVENUES AND

05:09:51.873 --> 05:09:53.942
EXPENDITURES AND WE PROJECTED

05:09:54.008 --> 05:09:56.344
THOSE OUT INTO THE FUTURE FOR

05:09:56.411 --> 05:09:57.445
THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND WHEN WE

05:09:57.512 --> 05:09:59.881
DID THAT. WE ALSO FACTORED IN

05:09:59.948 --> 05:10:02.183
SAN GABRIELS OWN TESTAMENTS OF

05:10:02.250 --> 05:10:04.185
THE NEW REVENUE THAT THE SALES

05:10:04.252 --> 05:10:05.987
TAX MEASURE WOULD GENERATE IF

05:10:06.054 --> 05:10:08.957
IT ACTUALLY PASSES. IN THE NEW

05:10:09.023 --> 05:10:10.858
HOTEL AND WHEN WE DID THAT. OUR

05:10:10.925 --> 05:10:12.927
ESTIMATE SHOWS THAT THE CITY'S

05:10:12.994 --> 05:10:14.595
GENERAL FUND WOULD STILL HAVE A

05:10:14.662 --> 05:10:16.464
NEGATIVE RESERVE BALANCE IN

05:10:16.531 --> 05:10:18.166
FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY

05:10:18.232 --> 05:10:20.702
FOUR. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE

05:10:20.768 --> 05:10:22.770
CITY'S BUDGETING PROCESS SEES

05:10:22.837 --> 05:10:24.372
AND BASICALLY WE FOUND THAT

05:10:24.439 --> 05:10:26.374
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE

05:10:26.441 --> 05:10:27.208
BUDGETS HAVE AN OVERLY

05:10:27.275 --> 05:10:29.277
OPTIMISTIC. AND THAT'S RESULTED

05:10:29.344 --> 05:10:30.411
IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE

05:10:30.478 --> 05:10:34.515
SHORTFALLS AND- EXPENDITURE

05:10:34.582 --> 05:10:36.117
OVERRUNS. THIS IS A QUICK

05:10:36.184 --> 05:10:37.552
EXAMPLE THERE NINETEEN TWENTY
