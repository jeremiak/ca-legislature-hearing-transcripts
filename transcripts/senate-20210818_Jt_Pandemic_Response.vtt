00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:36.640

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.476

WAYS THAT WE CAN MEASURE

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:56.160
PROGRESS. I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.027
OF DEBATE NATIONALLY ABOUT HOW

00:39:57.094 --> 00:40:01.398

ELLIE GAYS IN THE MIDST OF THIS

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:06.103
PANDEMIC SPIN TO REACT TO THE

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.071
PANDEMIC IN THE NEEDS OF

SQUARE STUDENTS FALL ON A

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.579
CONTINUUM OF SUPPORTS A

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.714
NATIONAL YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.115
DEBATES AROUND THAT I THINK BUT

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:23.921
OUR EFFORTS. WILL BE TO- AT THE

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:26.023
TIME. WERE OURS. ACROSS STATE.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.858
IT'S TOO BAD- IDENTIFY HOW WE

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.360
CAN DO THIS MORE EFFECTIVELY SO

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.796
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. FOR YOU

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.997

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:41.071
IS- WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:41.605

MOVE FORWARD AND- AS I'M

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:11.881
REMINDED THERE ARE MANY EFFORTS

FORWARD IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.469

FOR THE QUESTION CENTER AND-

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.514
IT'S COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT BUT

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.549
I'M GONNA SPEAK PLAIN AND TELL

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:27.483

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.252
THERE'S GOOD OPPORTUNITY AND

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.353
WHETHER SOME CHALLENGES HAT WE

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.022
NEED TO MANAGE AND STRATEGIZE

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.223
BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.358
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:37.593
BONDS I REMIND FULL OF THE FACT

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.963
THAT- THOSE GREAT PROGRAMS.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.131
GREW OUT OF YOUR CHAMBER GREW

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.200
OUT OF THE SENATE- AND-

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:46.469
CONTINUE TO LIVE ON WITH US-

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.172
BUT THEY HAD BEEN- YOU KNOW

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:51.107
PRIOR TO NOW BOTTLENECKS FOR

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.842
SOME COUNTIES AND IT'S BEEN

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.978
HARD TO MOVE THOSE DOLLARS-

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.246
IT'S BEEN HARD TO MOVE SOME OF

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.381
THOSE DOLLARS THE COMMUNITY

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.582
PRIOR TO THE END AND I THINK

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.451
WE'RE SEEING. GREAT MOVEMENT

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.519

RECOGNIZE IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.055
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:07.623
HEALTH DOLLARS THEIR FOCUS ON

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.425
SCHOOLS BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.127
WAY THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.929
FAMILIES ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.730
YEAH WE HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

ALLIANCE IN EVERY COUNTY HAS A

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.968
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ORGANIZATION

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.837
WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH THEM SO

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:23.473
GRADE AND- BLAND TOGETHER EVERY

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.608
SINGLE DOLLAR- THAT'S AVAILABLE

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.210
BECAUSE AS I POINTED OUT A LOT

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.244
OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.412
ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS ONE TIME

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.414
MONEY YEAH AND I THINK WE'LL GO

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.450
SYSTEMS BUT WE MAY ONLY GET A

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.952
LIFT FOR FEW YEARS UNLESS YOU

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.887

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.989
THAT CARRIES US BEYOND THE

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.624
INITIAL THREE OR FOUR YEAR-

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.226
THAT I THINK THESE DOLLARS CAN

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.827
PROVIDE INVESTMENT FOR I WOULD

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.996

NOT JUST IN RELATION TO MENTAL

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.590

SOME OF THESE DUMB. A GROUP A

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.666
GREAT DEAL OF THAT IS OUT OF

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.568
CONCERN ABOUT THE ONE TIME

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.303

IS BEST FOR KIDS DIRECTLY

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.778
IMPACT US ON A DAY TO DAY

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:20.081
BASIS- WE I'M VERY FORTUNATE TO

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.483

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.756
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:28.723
HAVE HERE IN IN IN OUR

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.158
DISTRICT. WE ARE LOW

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.261
SOCIOECONOMIC DISTRICT. AND WE

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.829
AS YOU KNOW WE SHUT DOWN ON

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:36.831
MARCH THIRTEENTH THINKING THAT

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:37.766
WE WERE GOING TO COME BACK TO

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:40.569
EDUCATION. AND WE HAD TO SHIFT

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.404
INTO EDUCATION VERY DIFFERENTLY

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.872
WE WENT INTO A DISTANCE

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:45.707
LEARNING AND WE STARTED SCHOOL

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:48.143
IN OCTOBER WE BROUGHT OVER

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:48.677
STUDENTS BACK IN A HYBRID

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.112
MODEL. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.248
DECIDED TO STAY IN DISTANCE

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:54.983
LEARNING. WE SHUT DOWN AGAIN

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.651
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH POSITIVITY

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:58.620
RATES IN LA HABRA. AND THEN WE

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.955
BROUGHT OUR STUDENTS BACK IN

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.524

EXPERIENCING WITH THE ANXIETY

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:12.100
AND THE FEAR IN THE

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.469
ANXIOUSNESS. WE DEAL WITH THAT

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.304
EVERY EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT I

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.973
HAVE TO TELL THE PANEL AND THE

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.941

WE SIMPLY JUST HAD TO TARGET

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:03.051
THE STUDENTS WITH THE LOWEST.

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.719
LEVEL OF ACADEMICS AND THIS

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:06.154
YEAR WE GET SOMETHING VERY

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.889

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:14.929
THREE WEEKS OF SUMMER SCHOOL

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.965
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPACT

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.333
SIXTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.934

SCHOOLS ALL NINE OF OUR

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:24.606
SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE PARTNERED

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.074
WITH THE CITY AND THEY

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:27.475
BASICALLY BROUGHT THEIR

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.244
EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO OUR

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.713

WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:52.000
I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THE

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:55.070
CONCERN THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.404

WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MONEY IS

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:41.950
GOING TO BE A SUSTAINABLE FOR

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.451
NEXT YEAR. THE OTHER THING THAT

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:44.919
WE ARE STILL GETTING ON WITH

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.688
THAT MENTAL HEALTH PIECE OF IT

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.656
IS THAT I'M A- FIRM BELIEVER IN

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:50.525
PHYSICAL FITNESS WITH OUR

ISSUES HAVE BEEN- ASTRID I HAVE

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.795
JUST BEEN HUGE. WE HAVE HAD TO

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:28.730
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.638
THE CONTACT TRACING AND THE-

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.872
ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE HAVE TO

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:56.825
WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IN THE

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:57.859
HARBOR IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.394
THAT WE KNOW OUR STUDENTS BY

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:01.696
NAME BY FACE AND BY STORY.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.698
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. OUR

DISTRICT AND SO FOR US TO FOCUS

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:13.641
ON THE ACADEMICS. IS CRITICAL

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.244
BUT WE ARE MORE FOCUSED THIS

WITH OUR VIRTUAL PROGRAM

NOT HAVE A VIRTUAL PROGRAM

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.557

VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE FOR OUR

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:49.103

STUDENT'S LICENSE SOMETIMES IT

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:54.715
JUST DOESN'T PRESENT ITSELF. IN

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:55.349
A WAY THAT'S REALLY EVIDENT IN

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:58.152
THE CLASSROOM- THERE WAS A

01:30:58.219 --> 01:31:00.254
SURVEY THAT WAS DONE RECENTLY.

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.156
AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE ACLU

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.325
WITH STUDENTS AND THEY DID ONE

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:05.626
IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:06.828
ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:08.896
IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. AND

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:10.331
WITH THAT SURVEY WHAT ARE THE

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:12.466
THINGS THAT THEY CAME UP WITH.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.035
AND WHAT THEY DETERMINED WAS

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.570
THAT STUDENTS SAD THAT WHAT

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:17.471
THEY NEED IS THEY NEED PEOPLE.

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:20.441
ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT THEY CAN

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.976
TRUST. AND THEN THAT TRUSTING

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.144
SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW AND THEY

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.745
CAN COUNT ON IT THEY CAN SHARE

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.314
WITH AND TALK THROUGH THINGS

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.050
WITH STRONG. AGAIN THAT MEANS

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.085
WE NEED MORE PERSONNEL SO. I

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.887
JUST WANT TO SAY AND I AND I

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:34.555
KIND OF. TOOK SOME NOTES OF

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.257
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.192
ASKED TO THE LAST- AGAIN I WANT

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.827

WHAT ARE THINGS ABOUT WORK

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.263
FORCE AND I THINK IT'S SO

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.599
IMPORTANT IS THAT- THERE ARE.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.567
PROBABLY THE ONLY WORK FORCE

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:48.135
GROUP THAT HAS ENOUGH PEOPLE

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:49.570

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:51.472
ROLES AS SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND-

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:53.274
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIRTY

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.242
EIGHT TRAINING INSTITUTIONS IN

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.043

FEEL ALL ROLES EXCEPT FOR THE

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.465
FACT THAT SOMETIMES THE RULER

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:18.633
IS IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.334
THAT. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY I

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:22.169

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:06.874
I'LL SOURCE WITH TO- HIGHLIGHT

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:07.842
ALL OF CREDIT COMMENTS- THE

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:09.477
STATE OR SHOULD- WE ALREADY

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.479
MOMENT TIME- IS TRUE THAT OUR

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.314
SYSTEM HAS STRUGGLED- IN FACT

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:16.751
WE ARE THE STATE'S LARGEST OF

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.318
THE NATION'S LARGEST MEDICAL

01:34:17.385 --> 01:34:19.186
PROGRAM AMONG WORST- BUT I ALSO

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:19.854
THINK THAT THE WINDS OF CHANGE

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.323
ARE BLOWING. SO WITH BOTH- WHAT

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.025
REALISTIC REVIEW OF WHERE WE

01:34:24.091 --> 01:34:24.759
STAND BUT ALSO SOME REAL

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.494
HOPEFULNESS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.162
YOU THROUGH SOME KEY PRINCIPLES

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.164
AND A LITTLE BIT OF DATA. SO

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.166
FIRST HIS WHILE TODAY'S HEARING

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.968
IS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF COLD IT.

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.636
IT MUST BE NAMED THAT YOUNG

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.171
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WERE IN

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.240
THE MIDST OF A CRISIS BEFORE

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:41.175
THE PANDEMIC. IN THE DECADE

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.144
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC TWICE AS

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.612
MANY CHILDREN WERE ADMITTED TO

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:45.613
SELF INJURY THROUGH EMERGENCY

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.681
DEPARTMENTS. WE SAW A 50%

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.550
INCREASE IN HOSPITALIZATION FOR

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.318
PAEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH.

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:52.887
DURING A TIME WHEN THE REST OF

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:55.456
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.024
DRAMATIC DECLINE IN BAD TASTE.

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.259
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING

01:34:58.325 --> 01:35:00.528
US SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:02.696
CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY.

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:03.297
THAT THEY NEED A LOT MORE THAN

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:05.466
THEY'RE GETTING. AND

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:06.901
UNFORTUNATELY WE RANK FORTY

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.102
EIGHTH IN THE NATION AND ACCESS

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:10.071
TO CARE FOR MEDICAID POPULATION

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:12.006
WHICH REPRESENTS SIX OUT OF TEN

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:14.241
CHILDREN IN THE STATE. AND

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:15.743
BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER ALL OF

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.478
THESE NUMBERS MEAN SOMETHING TO

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:17.945
ME BOTH PERSONALLY AND

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.714
PROFESSIONALLY. I HAVE WORKED

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:21.615
AS A THERAPIST AND YOGA PUBLIC

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:23.651
SCHOOLS. I WAS EMERGENCY ROOM

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:24.952
SOCIAL WORKER AND I LET ONE OF

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:27.021
THE STATE'S LARGEST. HEALTH

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.123
CARE SYSTEMS I KNOW THIS WORK

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.858
FROM ACTUALLY BILLING SERVICES

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:33.360
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND SCHOOLS

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:35.329
ARE ESSENTIAL FACTORS AT ANY

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.298
RESPONSE TO SCALE. BUT IT'S

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:40.201
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT KOBE

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:41.068
THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN

01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:43.270
GROWING IN OUR SOCIETY. MAYBE

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:44.305
FROM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.407
STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY MAYBE

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:48.109
FROM ONE SOCIAL MEDIA BECAME

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:50.311
AVAILABLE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:51.212
MAYBE FROM A PERPETUAL NEWS

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.913
CYCLE. THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.281
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSUME

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.016
WHATEVER THE REASONS SOMETHING

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:56.917
IS HAPPENING IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:58.752
LIVES AND WHETHER YOU EVER WERE

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:01.021
A CHILD OR HOW. YOU'RE PROBABLY

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.456
WORRIED ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:05.226
EMOTIONAL WELFARE CHILDREN AND

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:05.826
SCHOOLS ARE ON THE FRONTLINES

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.495
OF THAT CHALLENGE. AND YOU HAVE

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.729
TO DECIDE TO GET THIS DATA BY

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:13.601
RACE REALLY APPRECIATE THE.

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.001
QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:14.635
REPRESENTATIVE FROM LONG BEACH.

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:15.369
BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN. A

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.270
MUCH HIGHER PRICE. FOR THE

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.471
FAILURE OF OUR ABILITY TO

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:18.339
SUPPORT THEIR SOCIAL AND

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.574
EMOTIONAL WELFARE. MAKING

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.143
HEALING CENTER SCHOOLS ISN'T

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.544
JUST A QUESTION OF GETTING THE

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.279
MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.515
BUT THAT'S A BIG PART. IT'S WE

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:28.549
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:29.550
EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:31.185
SURGEON GENERAL WHO'S BRINGING

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:33.354
A BROAD CONSENSUS TO THE

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.589
REALITY THAT RACE AND CLASS

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:38.125
MATTER. THE EXPERIENCE FOR

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.426
YOUNG PEOPLE AND I CAN SEE THIS

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:40.828
FROM HAVING BUILD LITERALLY

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:42.630
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A SAFETY

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:44.598
THAT NORMAL SERVICES THE VAST

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:45.633
MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN AND

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:47.134
FAMILIES I SERVED WE'RE NOT

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:49.069
PATHOLOGICAL. THEY WERE DEALING

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.671
WITH LIVING IN A CULTURE THAT

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:51.639
TOLD THEM THEY WEREN'T WORTH

01:36:51.705 --> 01:36:53.541
ANYTHING OR STRUGGLING WITH THE

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.743
IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.511
AND POVERTY ON THEIR WELFARE.

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:58.646
AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.915
TODAY HAS LARGELY FALLEN DRIVES

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:03.017
THAT EXPERIENCE AND SO AS WE

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.451
INVEST THESE DOLLARS AS WE

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:06.187
BUILD THE CAPACITY OF SCHOOLS

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.988
TO DO THIS WORK. WE MUST ALSO

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:10.024
WE IMAGINE OURSELVES NOT AS A

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:14.295
RESPONSE TO BEST OLOGY. BUT AS

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:14.762
A SUPPORT FOR HEALTHY

01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:15.529
DEVELOPMENT. FOR THOSE OF YOU

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.631
WANT TO MASK THE IMPACT OF KOBE

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:18.899
EVERYTHING HERE IS COMING TO

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.234
PASS DRAMATIC INCREASES IN

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:20.968
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.603
UTILIZATION FOR YOUNGER AND

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.139
YOUNGER AGES. IN FACT IF YOU

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.173
HAD WITH THE IMPACT OF THE

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.609
PANDEMIC TO THE DATA I SHOULD

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.211
JOIN THE FIRST SLIDE. RADY

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.512
CHILDREN'S AS ONE EXAMPLE HAS

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:35.716
SEEN 17100% INCREASE IN

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:36.317
EMERGING FROM UTILIZATION FOR

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:36.951
CHILDREN. AND IN FACT WHEN YOU

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:37.985
DECIDE TO GET JUST THE LAST

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:41.755
YEAR. WE HAVE SEEN 34% FEWER

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:43.924
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THEN

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:46.660
AGAIN DESPITE THESE DRAMATIC

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:48.796
INCREASES IN UTILITY. SO IF

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:50.664
YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE BIT SCARED

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:51.232
OR DEPRESSED THEN YOU'RE NOT

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.767
LISTENING. AND SCHOOLS HAVE TO

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:55.603
BE ESSENTIAL ACTORS THE DOCTOR

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.670
PAM'S QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:58.005
ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PEDIATRIC

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.873
PRIMARY CARE. THAT'S REALLY

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.409
ESSENTIAL FOR LITTLE CHILDREN

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:03.577
ZERO TO FIVE ZERO EIGHT. WHEN

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:04.712
KIDS GET TO BE ABOUT EIGHT

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.413
YEARS OLD THEIR PERIODICITY

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.015
MEANING HOW OFTEN THEY GO TO

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:08.983
THE DOCTOR DECLINES

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.085
DRAMATICALLY MANY CHILDREN IN

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.519
THE MEDICAID SYSTEM BETWEEN THE

01:38:12.586 --> 01:38:14.255
AGE OF TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR.

01:38:14.321 --> 01:38:16.056
GO TO THE DOCTOR ONCE OR TWICE

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:18.626
FOR THEIR WHOLE ADOLESCENCE. SO

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:20.461
SCHOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL ACTORS

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:21.795
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE KIDS ARE

01:38:21.862 --> 01:38:23.931
AND DOCTORS MARCH DURING THE

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:27.101
TIME THAT 75% OF MUSLIMS

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.202
MANIFESTS. AND I'M NOT GONNA DO

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:29.203
A BIG MEDICAID PIECE BECAUSE

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.471
THAT'S THE WHOLE MEDICARE

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:31.605
REFORM LANDSCAPE THAT'S A WHOLE

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:33.540
SEPARATE PRESENTATION. WE HAVE

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:35.042
UNIQUE LEADERSHIP AND INDIRECT

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:36.543
LIKE PORN AND MARK GALLI WHO

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.679
WORK INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.080
NEW TUNE TO THIS ISSUE. BUT THE

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:41.649
FINANCES ALIGNED THERE'S REASON

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:44.818
THAT'S THE SCHOOLS AND MEDICARE

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:45.352
ARE LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.920
CHOCOLATE. SOME OF THE

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.389
UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IS

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:49.356
SOMETIMES SO MUCH IT'S HARD TO

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:51.258
TRACK. BUT I TRY TO ORGANIZE IT

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.459
IN A FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION

01:38:52.526 --> 01:38:53.427
DOLLAR USE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:55.396
INITIATIVE. THE FIFTEEN PLUS

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.230
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:57.631
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE

01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.166
FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS WHICH

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.568
CAN'T BE EXCLUDED. IN ORDER TO

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.037
UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE INVESTING

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:04.638
IN SCHOOLS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.840
ALL THREE OF THESE TOGETHER. IN

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:09.543
THE CONTEXT OF THE REFORM OF

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.178
OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. SO WHY IS

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:13.047
MEDICARE ALSO IMPORTANT. IT

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.315
COVERS ALMOST SIX OUT OF TEN

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:16.317
KIDS MORE INVOLVED IN EDUCATION

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.352
PROBABLY SEVEN OUT OF TEN. AND

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:19.920
UNFORTUNATELY LESS THAN 5% OF

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:20.821
THOSE CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.556
ANY CARE AT ALL LESS THAN THREE

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.425
PERCENT. ARE AN ONGOING CARE AS

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.393
MEASURED BY FIVE OR MORE VISITS

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.929
IN A CALENDAR YEAR. SO LET ME

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:31.098
END WITH A SLIDE. IN WE HAVE A

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:31.865
ONCE IN A. GENERATION

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.200
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.302
CRISIS THAT IS A SOCIALLY

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:38.339
CONSTRUCTED EPIDEMIC OF DESPAIR.

01:39:38.405 --> 01:39:39.873
WE DIDN'T JUST CHANGE SOMETHING

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.642
IN THE WATER IN THE EARLY TWO

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:42.609
THOUSANDS ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.445
SPIKED TWICE AS MANY KIDS

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.946
DIDN'T GET ADMITTED FOR SELF

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.481
INJURY JUST BECAUSE- OF

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:49.383
SOMETHING IN THE WATER. WE ARE

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:51.118
SO SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:51.652
OUR CULTURE WE ARE MAKING

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:53.921
CHILDREN SICK. WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.489
THE COURAGE TO REIMAGINE TO

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:56.757
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.325
AND REDEFINE WHAT MENTAL HEALTH

01:39:58.392 --> 01:40:00.527
THIS IS NOT SIMPLY RESPONSIBLE

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:02.563
POLICY. IT'S A SUPPORT FOR

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.498
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. AND IT IS

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:06.033
BASED ON THE BELIEF IN THE

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.601
WISDOM AND INTELLIGENCE OF LOW%

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.569
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:10.971
FAMILIES. I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:12.740
HUMAN SUFFERING. AND WHILE

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:16.110
THOSE EXPERIENCES HAVE MARQUEE.

01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:18.746
MY LARGEST TAKEAWAY IS A BEAUTY

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.414
AND WISDOM AND ABILITY TO

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:22.483
SURVIVE AND EVEN THRIVE IN THE

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:23.984
FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES. SO

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:26.653
THIS REDEFINITION OF MENTAL

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.221
HEALTH HAS TO BE PART OF THE

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.390
SOLUTION. WE HAVE TO HELP

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:30.591
SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE

01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:32.459
THE NEXUS OF HEALTH AND

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.293
EDUCATION WHICH MEANS

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.729
UNDERSTANDING A COMPLEX AND

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.564
EXTREMELY TROUBLED MEDICAID

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:39.566
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:40.768
TO TEACH SCHOOLS TO PARTNER

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:42.136
WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WHO

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.303
ALREADY CAN NAVIGATE THE

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.606
SYSTEM. YES WE SHOULD BE

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.307
INVESTING IN THEIR OWN CAPACITY

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.642
BUT THE ANALOGY I LIKE TO GIVE

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:51.545
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE EDUCATION

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:52.579
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO OWN ALL

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:54.014
THE FURNITURE IN IT. EVEN

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:54.615
THOUGH YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:56.817
IT IS. SO THE ESSENTIAL FOR

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:58.485
SCHOOLS IS TO COORDINATE OLD

01:40:58.552 --> 01:41:01.321
UNDERSTAND MANAGE NOT

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:03.891
NECESSARILY DO. AND FINALLY.

01:41:03.957 --> 01:41:05.726
THAT LIST OF DOLLARS I GAVE.

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:06.827
SCHOOLS HAVE TO SPEND THOSE

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:09.096
DOLLARS STRATEGICALLY TO BUILD

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.098
SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS BASED ON

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.800

SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

ONE OF THINGS I HAVEN'T HEARD.

01:56:50.236 --> 01:56:51.604
DISCUSSED AS MUCH AS I WOULD

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:53.239

OF STUDENTS. BUT HOW IMPORTANT

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.084
IS THAT WE PROMOTE THE WELL

01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:08.488
BEING OF TEACHERS- WE KNOW THAT

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.690
RIGHT NOW WITH THE- RECENT RAND

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:12.892
STUDY. FOUND THAT- WITH THE

01:57:12.959 --> 01:57:14.594
PANDEMIC THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:16.162
IN FOUR TEACHERS WERE PLANNING

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:18.064
ON LEAVING THE PROFESSION.

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:18.998
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE

01:57:19.065 --> 01:57:20.533
TEACHER SHORTAGE AND HOW CAN

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.668
YOU HAD THAT OFF- AND WHAT WE

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:24.237
KNOW IT'S UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS

01:57:24.303 --> 01:57:26.506
OF STRESS. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:27.807
JUST MENTION THE STUDY THAT WE

01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:29.742
DID. A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:30.510
STRESS CONTAGION IN THE

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:32.245
CLASSROOM YES STRESS IS

01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:34.046
CONTAGIOUS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:35.648
NOT STRESSED. IF YOU'RE AROUND

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.116
PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHLY STRESSED

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.551
YOU WILL CATCH IT. AND HAVE THE

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:39.619
NEGATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:41.821
CONSEQUENCES. EXAMINE THIS IN

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:43.256
THE CLASSROOM WE LOOKED AT PORT

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:44.757
THE SEVENTH GRADE CLASSROOMS.

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:46.058
AND HEAD TEACHERS COMPLETE A

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:47.660
MEASURE OF STRESS AND BURNOUT.

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:49.095
AND THEN FOR THE STUDENTS WE

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:53.499
WANT. TO GET THEIR STRESS UNDER

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:54.133
THE SKIN TO SEE. HOW WERE THEY

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:54.767
TO AND THERE'S A HORMONE

01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:56.202
CORTISOL. WHICH YOU CAN COLLECT

01:57:56.269 --> 01:57:57.770
AND SALIVA SO WE WENT TO THE

01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.238
STUDENTS AND WE YES WE DID

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.940
COLLECT THEIR SALIVA AND JUST

01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:02.308
SO YOU KNOW FOR THE SEVENTH

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:03.176
GRADE KIDS LIKE TO GIVE YOU

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:05.211
THEIR SPENT- AND SHIPPED TO

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.779
REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR STRESS

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:08.681
PHYSIOLOGY. WHAT WE FOUND WAS

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.283
FASCINATING WE FOUND THOSE

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.250
CLASSROOMS IN WHICH THE

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:12.552
TEACHERS REPORTED THE HIGHEST

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.187
LEVELS OF STRESS AND BURNOUT.

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:15.488
HAD STUDENTS WITH THE HIGHEST

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.557
LEVEL OF STRESS. SO WHAT WE

01:58:17.623 --> 01:58:18.825
KNOW NOW IS THAT IF YOU

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:21.627
ACTUALLY- HELP THE TEACHERS AND

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:22.962
HELP THEIR WELL BEING. THERE

01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:25.531
WILL BE A- A RIPPLE EFFECT INTO

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:27.467
THE CLASSROOM FOR THE POSITIVE

01:58:27.533 --> 01:58:29.368
WELL BEING OF STUDENTS. SO I

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:30.636
THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:31.637
TO REALLY THINK OF OUR

01:58:31.704 --> 01:58:33.606

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:41.113
REALLY WANT TO HAVE A WIDE

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.449
SCALE- UPTAKE ACROSS. YOUR

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:45.518
ENTIRE STATE HOW IMPORTANT IT

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.587
IS TO ACTUALLY INTEGRATE- THE

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:49.489
PROMOTION OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

PROCESS I CAN BE A LARGE

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:15.454
CHALLENGE SO. AFTER OVER A YEAR

SAID I. WANT EVERYONE TO KEEP

02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:22.888
IN MIND THAT THIS IS A- A

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.123
CENTRALLY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:25.557
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN USED TO IT

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:28.694
FOR. ALMOST TWO YEARS. AND YEAH

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.062
IT'S IMPORTANT TO VALIDATE YOU

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:31.964
THREE YEARS FOUND THIS

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:34.500
TRANSITION IS INTIMIDATING. AND

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:35.667
PLEASE BE OKAY REGARDLESS OF

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:36.768

OKAY WITH BEING. PERFORMING AT

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:44.710
A DIFFERENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:45.344
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:46.912
ENVIRONMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.847

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:49.882
TO LOOK FORWARD TO IS HOW WE'RE

02:09:49.948 --> 02:09:51.483
GOING TO. MAKE THIS TRANSITION

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:53.852
LESS OF A BLIND JUMP INTO A

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.187
COMPLETELY NEW ENVIRONMENT

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:56.922
WHERE WE FEEL INSECURE. AND

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:58.624
MORE OF A SMOOTH PATH WHERE WE

02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:00.425
HAVE RESOURCES TO FALL BACK ON.

02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:02.794
WHEREVER YOU ARE OR WE FORCE IT

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:04.429
RESOURCES TO LOOK FORWARD TO

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:06.198
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. SO IN

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:07.332
ORDER TO FEEL SECURE I FEEL

02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:11.236
LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING.

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:11.837
FOR EVERYONE TO LOOK TOWARDS-

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:15.908
I'D ALSO LIKE SAY. ON OF

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:19.344

KNOW THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.213
IMPROVING THIS YEAR AND I'VE

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.382
SEEN THAT IN MY OWN SCHOOL.

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:24.583
SCHOOLS MUST BE DOING BETTER

02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:26.518
THAN JUST FOR EXAMPLE PRINTING

02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:27.886
A SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.454
NUMBER ON THE BACK OF STUDENT

02:10:29.521 --> 02:10:31.590
ID CARDS THAT'S VERY PASSIVE WE

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:33.192
DON'T SEE IT OFTEN DEPENDING ON

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:34.493
WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO TO YOU MIGHT

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.394
NOT USE YOUR ID CARDS VERY

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:37.696
OFTEN. AND IT JUST BEING THERE

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:39.631

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:41.633
WHAT IS ON THOSE CARDS WHAT

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:43.335
EXACTLY THAT ENTAILS IF I WERE

02:10:43.402 --> 02:10:44.636
TO CALL THIS NUMBER WHAT HOPE

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:47.172
WHAT I RECEIVED OR- WHEN THEY

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:48.740
ACTUALLY PICK UP OR WOULD THEY

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:50.342
ACT WHEN THEY PUT ME ON HOLD

02:10:50.409 --> 02:10:52.678
WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT RESOURCES

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:53.979
WHEN THEY BE OFFERING TO ANSWER

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:55.247
THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT AND

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.382
THIS OCCASION ABOUT THESE MEN

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:58.684
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:00.419
HEALTH RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:01.920
CURRENTLY ACCESS AND WHAT WE'RE

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:03.255
WORKING TOWARDS MUST BE

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:05.123
NORMALIZED SO THAT TEACHERS AND

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:06.692
STUDENTS ALIKE CAN FEEL SECURE

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:11.763
ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE. AT.

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:12.898

THAT. REGARDLESS OF IF YOU'RE

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:22.040
THINKING ABOUT MORE OF THE ACT

MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WE'VE

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:26.211

STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE SO I

02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:29.014
CAN BE AN ACADEMIC SENSE FOR

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:30.549
EXAMPLE OFFERING MORE OFFICE

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.637
THAT IT'S BECOMING MORE AND

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:53.171
MORE POPULAR RECENTLY WHICH I'M

02:11:53.238 --> 02:11:54.873

JUST. EARLY MENTAL HEALTH AND

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:07.352
EDUCATION WILL REALLY BENEFIT.

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:09.321
BECAUSE WE WELL UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:11.390
WORK RACE AND WILL KNOW. THAT

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:13.525
IT'S NOT IT'S VALID BECAUSE-

EVERYONE HAS MENTAL HEALTH AND-

02:12:15.927 --> 02:12:17.396
WE I THINK WE HAVE THE SUBWAY

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:19.698
FROM THE IDEA THAT- MENTAL

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:20.832
HEALTH HAS ONE STRICT

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:22.934
DEFINITION OR ABOUT IT LIKE IF

IT. FITS INTO THIS ONE SPECIFIC

02:12:24.836 --> 02:12:26.104
BOX BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T

02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:27.739
BECAUSE IT CAN. COME IN MANY

02:12:27.806 --> 02:12:29.074
SHAPES AND FORMS DEPENDING ON

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:30.976

AND PERHAPS MORE A COMMENT AND

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:05.143
A QUESTION- I WOULD MAKE NOTE

02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:07.779
OF THAT- MR OF THE ATI

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.548
LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS THAT-

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:11.917
WINDOWS THAT ACTUALLY- ASIAN

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:13.251
AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE FAR MORE

02:13:13.318 --> 02:13:16.355
LIKELY TO BE LEARNING REMOTELY-

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:17.489
THAN ANY OTHER RACIAL ETHNIC

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:18.790
GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.592
ISN'T BORN OUT OF THE DATA.

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:21.593
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID FREIGHT OF

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.229
COVETED- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:25.397
COVE IT HAS LIKE MANY OTHER

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:27.799
PARENTS- ALSO BECAUSE OF THE

02:13:27.866 --> 02:13:30.168
HATE DIRECTED TOWARD. ATI

02:13:30.235 --> 02:13:31.837
STUDENTS SENT IT AND H. I.

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:33.839
COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK AS

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:35.674
WE'RE LOOKING AT- PROVIDING

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:36.341
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:38.543
RESOURCES. WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:40.379
THINK ABOUT IT'S NOT ONLY FOR

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:41.613
THE STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY SHOP

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:42.914
FOR IN PERSON LEARNING IT'S

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:44.449
ALSO OPTIONS FOR DISTANCE

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:45.884
LEARNING AND ALSO PROVIDING

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:46.718
THOSE SUPPORTS FOR DISTANCE

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.687
LEARNING AS WELL. AND CREATING

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:49.921
A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

02:13:49.988 --> 02:13:52.491
SCHOOLS SO- IN TERMS OF THE

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:54.760
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. WHEAT

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.595
AND FORTUNE WE DON'T ONLY HAVE

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:59.097
A VIRAL PANDEMIC WE ALSO HAVE A

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:04.936
HEAT CAN DAMAGE. AND FOR CITY

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.037
H. I. COMMUNE'S PARTICULARLY

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:09.541
BEEN TARGETED- AS AND UNFAIRLY

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:11.410
BLAMED US FOR THIS PANDEIC AND

02:14:11.476 --> 02:14:13.879
SO THIS IS CAUSING. IT AND THIS

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:16.081
IS IN A GROUP OF. PEOPLE WHO

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:18.116
USUALLY YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:18.950
ALL THERE TO WANT TO ALWAYS

02:14:19.017 --> 02:14:20.986
WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THE

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:23.021
FACT IS THE DATA SHOWS THAT

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:24.890
MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY GO

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.558
TO IN PERSON LEARNING SO I HOPE

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:29.127
THAT- I KNOW WE'RE VERY SHORT

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:31.062
TIME BUT I HOPE THAT- I KNOW

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:32.631
OUR PANELISTS AND EDUCATION

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:34.433
COMMITTEE WILL BE THINKING VERY

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:35.767
CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE CAN

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:37.302
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:38.703
THAT OUR STATE BUDGET WE AS

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:39.871
PART OF THE THAI EQUITY BUDGET

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:42.407
AS WELL- ALLOCATE SOME MONEY.

02:14:42.474 --> 02:14:43.742
THAT'S RIGHT THE DIRECT MENTAL

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:44.676
HEALTH SERVICES BUT TO HELP

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.845
SCHOOLS I FIGURE THIS OUT AND

02:14:46.912 --> 02:14:47.913
THEY GET SOME RESOURCES THERE

02:14:47.979 --> 02:14:49.581
AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:53.018

YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK THAT WAS

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.161
OUTSTANDING OBVIOUSLY NO

02:15:03.228 --> 02:15:04.796
ISOLATION IS THE NUMBER ONE ONE

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.765
OF THE NUMBER ONE REASONS FOR A

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:08.533
DEPRESSION AND THE LIKE SO-

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.902
ALCO IS IT A GREAT ORGANIZATION

02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:12.838
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:14.906
MY QUESTION IS TO AND I WAS

02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:16.341
REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE SLIDES

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:18.210
THAT ALEX I BELIEVE WAS ALEX

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:19.845
THAT 2% OF THOSE SLIDES VERY

02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:21.246
IMPRESSED BY THAT IN YOUR

02:15:21.313 --> 02:15:23.548
HISTORY OF SHOWING US THAT EVEN

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:26.284
PRIOR PANDEMIC WE HAD LOTS OF

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:27.185
ISSUES THAT- WE SHOULD'VE BEEN

02:15:27.252 --> 02:15:30.722
ADDRESSING. AS LEGISLATORS WE

02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:32.224
ALLOCATE MONEY THAT'S REALLY

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:33.425
WHAT WE DO WE ALLOCATE THE

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:34.793
MONEY AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.395
THE POLICY BUT WE'RE REALLY.

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:39.664
NOT EXPERTS IN ALL FIELDS WERE

02:15:39.731 --> 02:15:40.899
WERE JACKS OF ALL TRADES WE

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:41.900
KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A LOT

02:15:41.967 --> 02:15:43.134
OF THINGS AND SOME OF US ARE

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:45.871
EXPERTS IN ONE AREA BUT FOR

02:15:45.937 --> 02:15:48.573
THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AN

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.742
EXPERT IN- THE HEALTH- ONLY. BY

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:52.811
OBSERVANCE OR DEALING WITH OUR

02:15:52.878 --> 02:15:53.278
OWN FAMILY MEMBERS ARE

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:56.147
CONSTITUENTS. IF MONEY WAS NOT

02:15:56.214 --> 02:16:00.418
A FACTOR. AND PAUL AS IT WERE-

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:03.021
IS THERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT YOU

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:04.523
COULD POINT US TO AND I THINK

02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:05.924
ALEX MIGHT BE THE BEST ONE TO

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:07.492
ANSWER THIS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:09.027
THAT WE WERE WE ACTUALLY HEAL

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:12.030
PEOPLE- AND THERE'S A FORMULA

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:18.803
I'M LOOKING FOR- SOMETHING WE

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:19.804
IS WHAT WORKS IF WE HAD ALL

02:16:19.871 --> 02:16:21.473
THE- IF WE HAD EVERYTHING WE

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:22.941
NEEDED THIS IS HOW THIS WOULD

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:24.209
BE THE PERFECT MODEL DO YOU

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:26.211
HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SO THAT

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:27.879
WE COULD THEN ANALYZE AND

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:30.315
FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD THEN.

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:30.916
ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES TO GET

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:36.388
THERE. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF BUT

02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:40.358
THE ANSWER IS YES YES YES. WE

02:16:40.425 --> 02:16:42.460
KNOW THAT CULTURALLY RELEVANT

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:43.962
BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS THAT A

02:16:44.029 --> 02:16:46.932
RELATIONSHIP BASED. IMPROVE

02:16:46.998 --> 02:16:49.501
SCHOOL SUCCESS. IMPROVE

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:52.404
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IMPROVE

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:55.206
LIFE OUTCOMES AND ARE ESSENTIAL

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:55.674
TO HEALTHY GROWTH AND

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.709
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. I WILL

02:16:57.776 --> 02:16:59.044
SEND A COUPLE SLIDES TO THE

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.612
STAFF AND INTERACTING WITH JUST

02:17:00.679 --> 02:17:02.480
SO YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF FOUR

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:05.317
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. HOW

02:17:05.383 --> 02:17:07.619
COOL IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:08.553
OF THESE TYPE OF SERVICES THE

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:09.988
CHALLENGE AND I THINK IT WAS

02:17:10.055 --> 02:17:11.590
NAMED BY EMILY AND SOME OF THE

02:17:11.656 --> 02:17:14.025
OTHER SPEAKERS WHAT WE SAY IS

02:17:14.092 --> 02:17:15.827
THERAPIST IS ALL THERAPEUTIC

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:18.863
GAME PRESUPPOSES THERAPEUTIC

02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:21.967
ALLIANCE. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:22.534
GOOD IF THEY'RE TOO SHORT TO

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.102
KEEP ONE TALK TO YOU. SO THE

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.670
ESSENTIAL CHALLENGE FOR US IS

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:27.806
IN DO WE HAVE MODELS THAT WORK.

02:17:27.872 --> 02:17:29.975
IS CAN WE FINANCE THEM. AND

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.476
PLACE THEM WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE

02:17:31.543 --> 02:17:33.445
WILL ACCESS SEVEN. DELIVERED BY

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:35.013
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEM AND

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.982
YOU CAN GENERATE TRUST AN

02:17:37.048 --> 02:17:39.651
ALLIANCE WITH THEM. AWESOME I

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:41.186
WOULD REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:43.054
SEEING THAT SO THAT WE AS

02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:45.590
LEGISLATORS CAN. RESEARCH THAT

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:47.459
INFORMATION. AND PUT IN A MALL

02:17:47.525 --> 02:17:48.693
I'M A FARMER I KNOW IF YOU HAVE

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.595
SUNLIGHT WATER AND GET SO-

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:51.830
YOU'RE GONNA GROW CROP DOWN

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:52.597
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:53.965
VARIABLES IN THERE. AND

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:55.033
ANOTHER'S VARIABLES IN

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:56.368
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:57.902
BUT IF WE HAVE THOSE BASIC

02:17:57.969 --> 02:18:00.038
THINGS AS LEGISLATORS THEN WE

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:01.406
CAN THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:03.575
TO GET THOSE TOOLS. RESOURCES

02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:04.776
