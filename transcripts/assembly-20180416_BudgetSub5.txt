BOB SUB FIVE OF THEM UP PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET IS SO CALLED ORDER WE'RE GOING TO BEGAN BECAUSE. CLEARLY A WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON TODAY EVERYONE'S IN A IN A SEPARATE MEETINGS WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE A QUORUM HERE FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO ANY. A VOTE ITEMS UNTIL THERE IS A QUORUM. UP BUT WE CAN BEGIN WITH THE INFORMATION ITEM SINCE WE HAVE AT LEAST A ONE MEMBER OF THE OTHER PARTY PRESIDENT AND. SHE'S GIVEN US PERMISSION BUT NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE KITCHEN. OF NON VOTING ITEMS OUT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN BECAUSE ONE OF THE ITEMS IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN THE OTHER SO WE WILL BEGIN TO ITEM FIFTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH IS THE BOARD OF STAVING COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS BUT HAS A OVERVIEW OF PROP FORTY SEVEN WITHIN TO BEGIN WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOLMAN. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THAT THE SEC. AND. HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN I'M GOING TO START WITH A VERY GENERAL OVERVIEW. WE'RE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. SO IT UP REAL HIGH ALTITUDE I THINK AS MEMBERS ARE WELL AWARE. PROP FORTY SEVEN WAS A VOTER INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND IT RECLASSIFIED VARIOUS LOWER LEVEL FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS. AS A RESULT OF THOSE CHANGES STATE SAVINGS WERE CALCULATED AND A GRANT PROGRAM. A SIGNIFICANT GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE B. SEC WITH LAUNCHED THE STATE SAVINGS WERE DIVIDED UP INTO THREE POTS. THE FIVE PERCENT OF THE SAVINGS WOULD TO THE B. SEC'S OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT I'LL FOCUS ON. THE PURPOSE OF THAT GRANT IS. I TREATMENT SERVICES BOTH MENTAL HEALTH FOCUSED AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER FOCUSED FOR THE POPULATIONS. AFFECTED BY PART FORTY SEVEN AREN'T WE HAD THE MOST. INCLUSIVE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE EVER ENGAGED IN IN THE FORMATION OF AN EGG AND EXECUTIVES DURING COMMITTEE THE MOST ON DIVERSE COMMITTEE WE'VE HAD IN TERMS OF. GEOGRAPHY BACKGROUND WHO LIVED EXPERIENCE IT WAS A COMMITTEE OF EIGHTEEN MEMBERS. SIX OF THOSE WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE ON IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DIRECT EXPERIENCE IN THAT REALLY TRULY HELPED INFORM THE PROCESS WEALTHY DID PUBLIC HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE. ON I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTIONS MAY BE RELATED TO THE DEPOSIT SO ALL PAUSE THERE AND HAPPY TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY WANT TO ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE GRANTS. THE FUNDING AND SO FORTH ON THE SHORT VERSION IS THAT THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF SAVINGS WERE ARE COMBINED TOGETHER INTO A POT OF JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE COMPETITIVELY AWARDED. THOSE GRANTS BEGAN IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE PROJECTS. ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF UP AND RUNNING ACROSS THE STATE WE PROVIDED TO THE STAFF A SHORT SUMMARY HAND OUT OF THOSE GRANT DESCRIPTIONS AND. ON YOU HAVE THAT THERE. AND ALSO APPEARANCE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. JAMIE COMES FROM FINANCE. HELLO INCOME BRACKET ANNEAL LA OWED I JUST KNOW THAT THE PAST OUR OFFICE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CALCULATE THE SAVINGS. HOWEVER THE STATE AT THAT TIME CHOSE TO EMPLOY THEIR APPROACH AYE THIS YEAR'S CUT CALCULATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT METHODOLOGY. POWER OF THE EVER IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE FILE ITEM. THE DETAILS OF OUR CONCERNS FURTHER PLEASE DO. I THE MEASURE DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW THE DEPOSIT MUST BE CALCULATED SO THERE'S NO CORRECT WAY TO MEET ITS FISCAL REQUIREMENT. HOWEVER IN OUR VIEW THE ADMINISTRATION LIKELY UNDERESTIMATES THE SAVINGS FOR VARIOUS REASONS. OF FOR EXAMPLE ONE KEY ACT COMPONENT COMPONENT OF THE SAVINGS ARE THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH. I'M HAVING A LOWER PRISON POPULATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE IF PROP FORTY SEVEN HADN'T PASSED. I'M USING OUR APPROACH WE ESTIMATE THAT THE PRISON POPULATION SAVINGS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO BE DEPOSITED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE'RE LIKELY TENS OF MILLIONS HIGHER THAN OR ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF OF ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION. HOW WOULD WE ARE? WELL I'LL I'LL SEE IF ANYONE IS SENDING QUESTIONS THIS IS TONY JUDD EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS. HOW DO WE DISCERN WHO'S METHODOLOGY IS CORRECT? TERMS OF. TELLING US ABOUT THE MONEY BECAUSE I I YOU HEAR FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THAT. IT'S AN UNDER ESTIMATE THE SHOULD BE MORE DATA OUT OF THAT. AND. HOW DO WE DISCERN THAT IT WOULD WE DISCERN AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN AS EXTRA MONEY IN THE BANK I MEAN? HOW WOULD WE DISARM WHOSE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT? BUT MADELINE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE INITIATIVE ACTUALLY GIVES THE AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE THE CALCULATION. AND ONCE THE CALCULATION IS SET THAT AMOUNT IS NOT ADJUSTED SO AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY. SINCE PROP PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN WAS IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE COMPLETED THAT CALCULATION WITH SAME METHODOLOGY EACH YEAR. IS THERE ANY ANY EXTRA MONEY LEFT OVER. OR IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE. YOU SAY IT IS IT MUST BE. WHAT THE CALCULATION AGAIN IS SET BY A CERTAIN PARAMETERS WHICH I CAN? WHEN HAPPY TO PROVIDE DETAILS TO STAFF ON EXACTLY HOW WE DO THE CALCULATION I BELIEVE THE MAIN POINT OF CONCERN BETWEEN US AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS. A RATE. THAT AMOUNT TO SEE OF SAVINGS ATTRIBUTABLE AT THE CONTRACT BED RATE VERSES THE MARGINAL RATE. AGAIN WE HAVE A MORE DETAILED A BREAKDOWN WHERE WE HAVE TO ATTRIBUTE SAVINGS TO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT POPULATION REDUCTION MEASURES AND THEREFORE WE APPLY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. OF THE AMOUNT THAT SPECIFIC TO PROP FOR FORTY SEVEN WHEN WE DO OUR CALCULATIONS SO AGAIN ONCE THE CALCULATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THAT IS NOT AMENDED FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR. I WILL KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID. DO A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION AND THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE WAS OFFSETTING COSTS RELATED TO COURT WORKLOAD AND FULL WORKLOAD. OKAY AND YOU SAYING THAT THE NUMBER IS A HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID THAT WAS THE TOTAL OVER THREE YEARS THE NUMBERS HAVE VARIED OVER THE YEARS WE CAN BREAK IT DOWN YEAR BY YEAR. BUT OVER THE LAST THREE HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION JUST PERFECTLY FOR BSE SEE EXCUSE ME THERE WAS OTHER. SO THIS YEAR THAT THE AMOUNT IS OF ROUGHLY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS IT WAS. OF FORTY MILLION AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THAT SUITED ME THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FORTY FIVE MILLION AND. SUPPORT YOURSELF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE SAVINGS THE PORTABILITY SEC WAS JUST THE HUNDRED THREE. OKAY ALRIGHT TO. FOR THE ANY. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE ANYONE. HAVING ANY COMMENT STATEMENT THAT THEY LIKE. TO MAKE IT THIS TIME. OKAY NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT ALRIGHT THANK YOU. COMICS OF IN THAT SPOT. SINCE WE STILL HAVE A QUORUM LET'S MOVE BACK TO OUR OTHER ITEM. I WHICH IS THE. THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WHEN IT STARTED WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEPHANIE RUMORS RICH MAN CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUBURN WITH ME AS PRINCIPAL AUDITOR BOB HARRIS. WHILE WE WERE ASKED TO COME IN AND SHARE WITH YOU OUR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW WE A HAVE PROGRESSED IN OUR LITIGATION WITH C. JP AT THIS POINT UP TO THIS POINT IN TIME. AS TODAY'S AGENDA INDICATES ARE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SIXTEEN JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVED AN AUDIT OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL THE AUDIT APPROVED OF THE APPROVED AUDIT DIRECTED OUR AUDIT TO OUR OFFICE TO INDEPENDENTLY. TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED AND VERIFIED INFORMATION RELATED TO THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT CGP FOR HANDLING IN RESOLVING COMPLAINTS. AGAINST JUDGES IT INCLUDED NINETEEN OBJECTIVES AND HAD AN ESTIMATED COST OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS IS OUR USUAL USUAL PRACTICE WE. SENT TO SEE JP. ARE DO NOT DESTRUCT LETTER ASKING THEM TO MAINTAIN THE RECORDS THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR. OUR WORK AYE BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A TEAM THAT WAS PREPARED TO IMMEDIATELY START THE WORK AND SO. ON OCTOBER THIRD WE ACTUALLY SENATE JOB START LETTER TO SEE JP. ASKING AT LETTING THEM KNOW THAT WE WOULD SOON BE OF HAVE HOLDING OUR ENTRANCE CONFERENCE AND WOULD SOON COMMENCE THE AUDIT WORKING IT UP UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME WE HADN'T HEARD FROM CGP AT ALL IN TERMS OF. OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE AUDIT OR CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE RECORDS THAT WE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE WORK. ON OCTOBER THIRD THE FORMER CGP DIRECTOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL. EMAILED MISTER HARRIS TO INFORM HIM THAT CTP HAD SOUGHT OUTSIDE OF THE TOP THE ADVICE ABOUT SITE COUNCIL WITH REGARD TO ITS OBLIGATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE AUDIT AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF C. JP'S RECORDS. ON. OCTOBER FOURTEENTH WE RECEIVED A LENGTHY LETTER FROM C. JP INFORMING US THAT IT HAD A CONCERNS ABOUT OUR RIGHT TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION IN FACT. A WE WERE TOLD THAT ONLY CGP HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT'S HE JP RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT SHE JP IS RULE ONE OH TO. DOES NOT PERMIT THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO ACCESS THE JP IS CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. IF YOU GET CLEAN IS TO JP ALSO INFORMED US THAT OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL HAD ADVISED THAT THE COMMISSION. IS NOT REQUIRED TO AND COULD NOT PROVIDE OUR OFFICE WITH ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL FILES AND PROCEEDINGS. IT WENT ON TO CLAIM THAT UNDER THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE THE LEGISLATURE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO AUTHORIZE OUR OFFICE TO PERFORM. THE AUDIT AND TO REVIEW THE COMMISSION'S DELIBERATE OF FILES. NEVERTHELESS THE DAY BECAUSE THAT LETTER BY SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO WORK WITH US AND WERE EAGER TO HAVE THE INFERENCE CONFERENCE THE BETRAYED WORK OUT THESE ACCESS ISSUES. ABOUT HEARTENED US MISTER HARRIS CONFIRMED THAT OUR INTERESTS CONFERENCE WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH SHOULD PROCEED AND SO THE TEAM OF LED BY MISTER HARRIS AND SOME. OTHER FOLKS FROM OUR OFFICE WENT OVER TO HAVE OUR ENTRANCE CONFERENCE WITH C. JP. I'M IT WAS A TENSE MEETING. AND AFTER THE ENTRANCE CONFERENCE. MISTER HARRIS AND HIS TEAM. ASKED TO DO SOME SCOPING WORK WHICH WAS SOME INITIAL WORK THAT WE DO ON EVERY AUDIT. TO FORGET THE LAY OF THE LAND AND UNDERSTAND THE PROPHECIES THAT ARE IN PLACE AT THE PLACE THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO EXAMINE. MR OUGHT MISTER HARRISON IS AN IS AUDIT TEAM WERE PLACED A SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM WERE TOLD THEY COULD NOT LEAVE THE ROOM. AND ONE BY ONE SEE JP EMPLOYEES BROUGHT TO THEM CERTAIN RECORDS ON FILES MOST OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. TO EXAMINE TO LOOK AT. BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DO WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO WHICH IS GOING IN AND EXAMINE ALL THE RECORDS THAT WE NEED TO PERFORM OUR WORK IN GAME AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK THAT. CGP DOES. WHILE THE TEAM WAS. IN THIS CONFERENCE ROOM TRYING TO DO SOME WORK AT C. JP OUR LEGAL OFFICE SENATE RESPONSIVE LETTER TO SEE JP EXPLAINING THAT. DESPITE SEE JP'S ASSERTIONS WE FEEL THAT THE LAW PERMITS US TO ACCESS SEE JP IS CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS AND ALSO IMPOSES ON US A DUTY TO PROTECT THOSE RECORDS. WE EXPLAIN THAT NO YOU SAW KNOW OUR CONFLICT WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT YOU JP. RELIES ON FOR ITS AUTHORITY IN FACT WE ARGUED THAT WE NEED TO HARMONIZE THOSE PROVISIONS IN THAT ONCE WE HARMONIZE THOSE PROVISIONS WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR US TO ACCESS THE WORK. AND ALSO PROTECTED AS WE DO IN EVERY AUDIT WITH EVERY AUDIT T.. I'M. NEVERTHELESS AFTER SOME. BACK AND FORTH. WE WERE ULTIMATELY NEED TURNED AWAY TOLD THAT WE COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY CONFIDENTIAL FILES. AND WE WERE SURPRISED A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER ON OCTOBER TWENTIETH NGUYEN CGP FILE OR A WRIT WHEN THE SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT. TO PROHIBIT US FROM ACCESSING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO PROHIBIT US FROM AUDITING ITS CORE JUDICIAL FUNCTION AND IT FROM CHARGING CGP FOR THE COST OF THE AUDIT. ON NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN WE FILE OUR ANSWER TO SEE GPS PETITION. OF THE THE MATTER WAS SHIFTED BETWEEN JUDGE JUST A FEW TIMES BUT ULTIMATELY. WE HAD OUR FIRST ORAL ARGUMENT ON AUGUST SEVENTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AFTER THAT HEARING THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE ASKED BOTH PARTIES TO SUPPLEMENT ONLY BRIEF THE MEANING OF THE WORD CONFIDENTIAL AS USED IN THE LAW. WE COMPLETED THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFINGS SUBMITTED THAT I AM AND. HAD OUR SECOND ORAL ARGUMENT ON FRIDAY NOVEMBER THIRD OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH. SUPERIOR COURT GRANTED SEE JP IS RICK. HOLDING THAT COMMISSION RULE ONE OH TO HOUSE CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINS AND THEREFORE SEE JP IS THE ONLY ENTITY. THAT CAN DETERMINE WHAT RECORDS IT WILL RELEASE. AND. THAT THE STATE AUDITOR'S ACCESS STATUTE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE POINT TWO IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS APPLIED TO SEE JP AND THEREFORE WE COULD NOT ACCESS THE JP'S RECORDS. THE COURT THE COURT FURTHER HELD THAT WE. COULD NOT PERFORM WORK ON AUDIT OBJECTIVES TO FIVE AND TWELVE BECAUSE THAT WORK WOULD ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE INTERFERE WITH C. JP'S CORE FUNCTION. AND THAT IT THERE FOR WOULD VIOLATE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE. WE DISAGREE WITH THE LOWER COURT HEARING WE HAVE APPEALED THAT DECISION WE IMMEDIATELY FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL IT TOOK. THE LOWER COURT A FEW WEEKS TO. WORK THROUGH ITS BACKLOG AND IT EVENTUALLY SENT OUR NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL IN FEBRUARY. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE FILED OUR OPENING BRIEF WITH THE COURT WILL ALSO FILED A PETITION TO TRANSFER THE MATTER DIRECTLY TO THE SUPREME COURT AND SEE JP. DID NOT OBJECT TO THAT PROCESS NEVERTHELESS THE THE US SUPREME COURT DENIED THAT PETITION FOR TRANSFER LAST WEDNESDAY ON APRIL ELEVENTH. SO THIS MEANS THAT THE CASE MUST BE HEARD IN THE COURT OF APPEAL BEFORE EITHER PARTY COULD ASK THE SUPREME COURT TO HEAR IT. OF THAT PROCESS TYPICALLY TAKES A YEAR AND A HALF TO THREE YEARS. C. JP'S APPELLATE BRIEF IS DUE TO BE FILED ON APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH. I HAVE SPOKEN RECENTLY WITH C. JP'S NEW CHIEF COUNSEL DIRECTOR MISTER DRESSER. HE CONTINUES TO INVITE US TO PERFORM THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE AUDIT. NEVERTHELESS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM OUR WORK PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS THAT. ARE PUT OUT BY THE U. S. COMPTROLLER. FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS WE WON'T BORE YOU WITH UNLESS YOU LIKE THE DETAILS IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO PERFORM THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK FILL BOTH NINETEEN OBJECTIVES. AND ONLY LOOK AT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FINANCIAL RECORDS. SO AT THE PRESENT TIME WE ARE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE COURT OF APPEAL AND WE INTEND TO ASK THE LOOK THE COURT OF APPEAL TO EXPEDITE THE CASE HOPEFULLY THE COURT WILL DO THAT. UNTIL THEN WE WAIT FOR THE COURT'S RULING AND MISTER HARRIS MEYER HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE US. ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS FROM. BERMAN FINANCE A LA O. OR. THEY'RE NOT HERE PART OF THIS OKAY SO THE INNING. ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS HERE FROM LEGACY JP. WE ARE WE DO A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OTHER. OF MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I I HAVE A PREPARED SPEECH LIVES IN NAME TO YES MY NAME IS GREGORY DRESSER I'M THE DIRECTOR CHEAT THE NEW DIRECTOR CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AGREES THAT IT SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND HAD AND HAS NEVER CONTENDED THAT IT ISN'T SUBJECT TO AUDIT. THE COMMISSION HAS SIMPLY SOUGHT TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY OF CERTAIN COMMISSION RECORDS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND COMMISSION RULE. THE SUCH CONFIDENTIALITY ALLOWS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LAWYERS COURT STAFF. AND ARM OTHER JUDGES TO MAKE COMPLAINTS TO THE COMMISSION WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION OR REPRISAL. CONFIDENTIALITY ALSO PROTECTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE REPUTATIONS OF JUDGES WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE. UNFOUNDED OR DO NOT HAVE FACTUAL SUPPORT. IT IN FACT IN ITS DECLARATORY RELIEF COMPLAIN THE COMMISSION STATED. MANY OF THE TOPICS IN THE AUDIT ARE CLEARLY APPROPRIATE AREAS OF INQUIRY FOR THE STATE AUDITOR. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE AUDITOR WANTS TO EXAMINE THE CDP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS WORKLOAD STATISTICS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF STAFF. ALL OF THESE TOPICS ARE CLEARLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S LEGITIMATE INTEREST AS THE ENTITY AUTHORIZING THE CJ PIECE BUDGET. BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WILLING TO MAKE AVAILABLE ALL RECORDS RELATED TO THESE TOPICS FOR THE AUDITOR FOR APPROPRIATE EVALUATION. AT THAT TIME THE COMMISSION OFFERED TO PROCEED WITH THOSE PORTIONS OF THE AUDIT IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE FISCAL AUDIT. PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE OTHER ISSUES. THE COMMISSION REPEATED THAT OFFER TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK. IN A STATEMENT OF DECISION THE SUPERIOR COURT CONFIRMED THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS THAT THE AUDITOR SOUGHT TO REVIEW. I WAS A PART OF ITS RULING THE SUPERIOR COURT AGREED WITH THE COMMISSION THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. PROVIDES THAT CERTAIN RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND GIVES THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CONFIDENTIALITY FOR COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS. AS MENTIONED THE COMMISSION SINCE CONFIDENTIALITY RULE PROTECTS COMPLAINANTS AND WITNESSES IN ADDITION TO JUDGES. THE SUPERIOR COURT RESOLVED. THAT THE COMMISSION'S RECORDS HAVE TOOK THAT HOW CLOSE TO SHORE PROTECTION ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE AUDITOR. NONE THE LESS THE COMMISSION REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO ACHIEVE A RESOLUTION THAT WILL PERMIT THE AUDITOR'S STAFF. TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE RECORDS IT NEEDS TO AUDIT THE COMMISSION. WHILE PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF COMMISSION RECORDS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND COMMISSION RULES. I'M AS WAS MENTIONED IN AN EFFORT TO EXPEDITE THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE THE COMMISSION DID NOT OPPOSE THE AUDITOR'S PETITION. SEEKING REVIEW AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING A DECISION FROM THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL ALTHOUGH THE SUPREME COURT DENIED THAT PETITION LAST WEEK. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT RECORDS IN POSSESSION OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WOULD CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM FOR THE COMMISSION. IF IT HAD TO DISCLOSE ITS CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS TO THE AUDITOR. ALTHOUGH THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDITOR'S STAFF SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT PUBLISH THE COMMISSION'S CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. THEY CANNOT ASSURE THAT THE COMMISSION'S CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO REQUEST UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. GIVEN THIS POSSIBILITY AND THE COMMISSION'S OBLIGATIONS TO VARIOUS CONSTITUENCIES WHO RELIED ON AND CONTINUE TO RELY ON. THE COMMISSION'S CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS THE COMMISSION WAS COMPELLED TO FILE AN ACTION TO SEEK JUDICIAL GUIDANCE. WITH AN ALREADY STRAINED BUDGET THE COST OF OBTAINING A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION WAS BURDENSOME TO THE COMMISSION. BUT PROCEEDING WITHOUT A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COSTLY HOWEVER BOWLS TO THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THE COMMISSION. AND FOR THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR FAILING TO SAFEGUARD THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE COMMISSION IS CONFIDENT IN ITS ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEMBERS AND STAFF. IT BUT ITS MEMBERS AND STAFF HAVE BEEN GOOD STEWARDS OF THE STATE'S BONDS. EVEN WHEN OPERATING ON A REDUCED BUDGET FOR MANY YEARS. SINCE. SINCE GAINING BUT IT BUDGET INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE COMMISSION HAS RETURNED MORE THAN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS COULD TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND I HAVE LOVED BREAKDOWN OF EACH OF THEM FISCAL YEAR FROM. OP FROM BAND TO TOOK PRESIDENT TOOK SHOWS TO SHOW THE AMOUNTS RETURNED IN EACH BUDGET YEAR. FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS THE COMMISSION STAFF WAS REDUCED BY TWENTY PERCENT TO MEET A SERIES OF BUDGET CUTS. TODAY THE COMMISSION CONTINUES TO OPERATE WITH TEN PERCENT LESS AGO. ESPY INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT COMMISSION STAFF. THAT COMMISSION STAFF HANDLES. THIS AFFECTS THE COMMISSION'S MISSION AND ITS ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED STAFF. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO MAINTAIN THE COMMISSION'S BUDGET AT ITS CURRENT LEVEL TO SUPPORT ITS MISSION AND TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC AND SAFEGUARD THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. UP OF COURSE THE COMMISSION WELCOMES ANY SUGGESTIONS THE AUDITOR MAY HAVE AS TO HOW THE COMMISSION CAN IMPROVE. ITS EFFICIENCY GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF ITS BUDGET AND I JUST WANTED TO A. COMMENT ON. THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT JUST A LITTLE BIT ARM I WORRY WHEN PEOPLE SAY OUR. RECORDS THAT THE COMMISSION DECIDES ARE CONFIDENTIAL AS IF DOTS AND AT THAT IS A DECISION MADE AD HOCIN ORDER TO. SAY THAT CERTAIN RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL IN CERTAIN ARE NOT IT'S WELL DEFINED THE RECORDS THAT ARE CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC ARE CONFIDENTIAL. INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL IF ARM IF A JUDGE'S CHARGED WITH ETHICAL VIOLATIONS IN FORMAL PROCEEDINGS THE CHARGES ARE PUBLIC AND ALL DOCUMENTS FILED AFTER THAT OUR PUBLIC SO IT'S NOT A DEFINITION. THAT IS USED FOR HIDE THINGS IT IT'S COOLEY YEAR AND. AND IT'S AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WELL DEFINED FOR A LONG TIME ON HIM AND IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DONE ON A AND ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN AN ATTEMPT TO. HIDE THINGS OF MY GOING ON FOR QUITE A WHILE I'M HERE WITH. TWO COMMISSION MEMBERS ERICA YOU WHO IS A JUDICIAL NUMBER OF THE COMMISSION AND ALSO MARY LOU OUR ANGER AND WHO IS A PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS. OF MY COLLEAGUE. JANICE PRICKLY WHO IS THE LEGAL ADVISER TO THE COMMISSION CAT WILL BE GOING TO FURTHER ONE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WEBER HERE. JONES SAWYER. LACKEY HERE MOMENTOUS. STONE. FIND PERFORMANCE BUT ESTABLISH OKAY IT COULD GET REALLY HAVING OF THE COMMENTS FROM THOSE OF YOU YES YES IF YOU HAVE TIME MY NAME'S ERICA YOU I'M A JUDGE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND I'M A. FORMER CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION AND ALSO STILL SIT ON THE COMMISSION. I HAVE JUST SOME BRIEF COMMENTS A WING WE KNOW THAT THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE COMMISSION IS SECRETIVE AND. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS DONE IN CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY SEEKS TO PROTECT THE BENCH OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING INVESTIGATED. BUT ACTUALLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF CONFIDENTIALITY IS A BALANCE IT PROTECTS THE COMPLAINANTS WITNESSES AS WELL AS THOSE ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT. AND THE. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THIS BALANCE SHOWS THAT THIS WAS DEEPLY CONSIDERED AND THOUGHT ABOUT BY THE LEGISLATURE BYTHE COURT BY EMPLOYERS THE BAR. AND BY THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY PASSED PROPOSITION ONE NINETY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SO IT'S NOT REALLY JUST THE COMMISSION COMING UP WITH SOMETHING OUT OF THIN AIR THIS WAS. YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT CONFIDENTIALITY IS TRULY IMPORTANT. THERE'S. IT'S EVEN SUCH A CONCEPT RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE STATE IN THE IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T GIVE CONFIDENTIALITY TO COMPLAINANTS AND THAT'S THE STATE OF ALABAMA. WOULD HAPPEN IS FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE ROY MOORE INSTITUTED A RULE THAT WAS PUNITIVE TO TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT HIM AND HE MADE IT RETROACTIVE ANY DID NOT SEND IT OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SO IN IN THAT STATE THERE IS NO CONFIDENTIALITY THE ABA STUDY THAT SIT AND FOUND THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS NOW A MASS. WHAT HAPPENED IS LAW ENFORCEMENT REFUSES TO WORK THAT COMMISSION IN THAT STATE NOW BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF VICTIMS? OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. AND COMPLAINANTS ERRORS IN A MISSION CARRIERS WHO. PROVIDE LEGAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE FOR LAWYERS ADVICE THE ALABAMA STATE BAR AND ALL THE LAWYERS WHO PRACTICE THERE THAT EVER IF EVER A LAWYER COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR JUDGE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALL PUBLIC. THAT LAWYER AND THAT LAWYERS LAW FIRM HAS TO ADVISE THAT LAW FIRM IN THAT LAWYERS ALL THEIR CLIENTS EVEN ONE UP BEFORE THE JUDGE. THAT THAT LAWYER MADE A COMPLAINT SO TO SUCH A CHILLING EFFECT. AND PRESIDING JUDGES IN SUPERVISING JUDGES IN ALABAMA AND COURT STAFF NO LONGER FILE COMPLAINTS ABOUT JUDGES BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH FEAR OF RETRIBUTION. AND THAT WHAT WE FOUND IN TWENTY YEARS OF LOOKING AT COMMISSION DATA IS THAT THERE'S A VERY HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPLAINTS MADE BY JUDGES AND COURT STAFF AND CALIFORNIA. AN ACTUAL DISCIPLINE GIVEN TO BENCH OFFICERS AND THAT'S BECAUSE. THOSE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE CA CANNONS REQUIRE OF US JUDGES IN TERMS OF BEING ETHICAL. AND THERE THEY HERE VARIED THERE EVERY DAY SO THEY SEE IT AND SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT I THINK TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENTIALITY. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE STILL WORKING COURT HOUSES WHERE THE JUDGES STILL SET. AND SO MY COLLEAGUE MS AYE AIRING DURING WILL TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPLAINANTS AND COURT EMPLOYEES. OKAY. BIT. GOOD AFTERNOON MARY LOU ANGER AND I'M A CERTIFIED SPANISH INTERPRETER HAVE WORKED IN THE COURT SYSTEM IN COURTS ALL OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. ANIMAL SO PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF INTERPRETERS I JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BUT MORE PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN THE COURT SYSTEM ND REPRESENTS COURT EMPLOYEES. I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AND WORKED WITH OTHER WORKERS AS A WIN I'VE WITNESSED IT AND I'M A PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION I'VE SERVED ON THE COMMISSION FOR SEVEN YEARS. AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I'VE REALLY SEEN HOW INTIMIDATED PEOPLE ARE AT THE. REAL A KIND OF AWESOME POWER THAT JUDGES HOLD AND THEY THE AUTHORITY THAT THEY HOLD SO OF COURT WORKERS. ARE WORKING IN COURTROOMS WHERE JUDGES ARE DOING THEIR JOB AND TO. YOU KNOW HAVE THIS POWER AND THEY'RE ALSO TO THEIR EMPLOYERS AND SO I'VE SEEN. COURT WORKERS WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ARE TOO AFRAID TO REPORT IT TO THE COURT ADMINISTRATION OR IN SOME CASES EVEN HAVE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE COURT ADMINISTRATION. AND IT'S BEEN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE C. JP'S COMPLAINT PROCESS AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAS MADE THESE WORKERS FEEL CONFIDENT AND SAFE REALLY TO STEP FORWARD AND SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY WITNESS EITHER THEMSELVES OR. WITH OTHER WORKERS OR WITH LITIGANTS AND WITH THE PUBLIC SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY IS A VERY REAL. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THIS CGP PROCESS THANK YOU. IT DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YOU'RE VERY VERY BRIGHT ARE WHICH IS MY MY NAME IS JANICE PRICKLY AND THE LEGAL ADVISER TO THE COMMISSIONERS I THINK THE LEGAL POINTS HAVE BEEN COVERED BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE TWO BRIEF COMMENTS. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STAFFS ARM OF THE COMMISSION ONE IS THAT. BEFORE I WAS HIRED AS THE LEGAL ADVISER I WORK IS INVESTIGATING ATTORNEY. AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT WHEN I WOULD CALL WITNESSES OR EVEN COMPLAINANTS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASE THEY WERE VERY OFTEN RELUCTANT TO TALK UNTIL THEY WERE ASSURED. THAT THEIR STATEMENTS WOULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL AND LESS THE CASE WENT TO FORMAL PROCEEDING WHICH IS VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES. HE'S OFTEN ATTORNEYS WHO CONTINUE TO APPEAR BEFORE THESE JUDGES. COURT STAFF AS WAS MENTIONED AND LED AGAINST WHAT I'M GOING CASES. THE OTHER BRIEF POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. STAFF IN OUR OFFICE WORKS VERY VERY HARD THEY HAVE HEAVY CASELOADS. A HOT DAY ARE COMMITTED TO THE MISSION OF THE COMMISSION WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF JUDICIARY. AND. ANY CUT IN OUR BUDGET WOULD NECESSARILY MEAN MUCH HEAVIER CASELOADS BACKLOG DELAY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS IT WOULD HINDER THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. NO I DIDN'T HAVE REQUEST. THIS WAS THE STONE. THANK YOU. HERE'S THE DILEMMA. THE QUESTION REALLY IS AND. WHETHER NOT. WE AGREE THAT THE RECORDS ARE TO BE HELD CONFIDENCE. THE QUESTIONS WHETHER. THE AUDITOR. PERFORMING A FUNCTION ASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WILL HOLD THOSE RECORDS CONFIDENTIAL AND THE OUTER SAYING YES THEY WELL. AND THAT'S SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. SHOULD VIOLATE. YOUR OBLIGATIONS OF OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT'S THE PIECE THAT REALLY ULTIMATELY NEEDS TO GET WORKED OUT HERE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN THE EDUCATION AND FORTUNATELY IT MAY TAKE US AWHILE TO GET TO SOME RESOLUTION AND IN THE MEANTIME. THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE. WE TAKE AR OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE DO THAT A COUPLE OF WAYS AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT IS ASKING THE AUDITOR TO GO IN AND AUDIT. NOT JUST THE FINANCIALS BUT THE FUNCTION OF ORGANIZATION THIS HAPPENS TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY ACTUALLY CAN HOLD THINGS CONFIDENTIAL WEARS IF WE'RE DOING IT IT'S NOT HELD. SO WE DO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. MY COMMITTEE OR HERE THROUGH THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. WE CAN ASK PEOPLE TO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS. SO. FOR US TO WEIGH IN ON A BUDGET ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO UNDER. IS. HOW WOULD ORGANIZATIONS FUNCTIONING? WHAT THE INTERNAL RULES ARE? HOW DO RESPONSIVE THEY ARE OR AREN'T IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY THE PUBLIC? AND. NOT WANTING TO BREAK THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN. YOU DESCRIBED ALABAMA WHERE THERE'S NO TRUST ACCOUNTANTS IN THE SYSTEM WE KEEP HEARING I KEEP HEARING. CONCERNS ABOUT HOW SEE JP IS IS FUNCTIONING AND AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TO FERRET OUT AND FIGURE OU WHAT'S REAL WHAT'S NOT REAL. AND HOW WE DO THAT IT WOULD AND YES WE ARE. SEPARATE YOUR GOVERNMENT AND SO WE WE WOULD HAVE TO PASS LAWS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN OR SEEK CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT WE CAN'T IF WE THOUGHT THERE WAS. AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED IT TO RESOLVE BUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHERE THE ISSUES ARE. AND THAT'S WHY WE ASK THE AUDITOR TO GO DO THAT FUNCTION. AND I WORRY THAT THE LAWSUIT. AND EVERY SIDES AND TELL ME WHAT WE'RE RIGHT WE'RE RIGHT. TEN CHILE. AND FLICKS OR INFRINGES ON OUR ABILITY TO DO OUR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AND AND GO GET INFORMATION. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED THROUGH THE OUTER. HOLD IT CONFIDENTIAL SO THAT YOU'RE SATISFIED THAT THAT THE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT THE PUBLIC MARKET HAPPEN. LET US POTENTIALLY FROM EITHER POLICIES EMPLOYED AND OR BUDGET STANDPOINT. REVIEW AND LOOK AT. THE SYSTEM THAT TGP USES TO HOLD JUDGES ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. AND IN THE MEANTIME BE ABLE TO MAKE. LEGITIMATE BUDGET. DECISIONS THAT. THAT GET YOU THE MONEY THE RESOURCES TO GO DO THE FUNCTION THAT THAT YOU NEED TO BEFORE. THAT SORT OF WHERE WE ARE AND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT NOW A COUPLE YEARS I THINK THAT'S CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING. FOR EVERYBODY IF THIS ENDS UP WITH OUR WITH. PUTTING SOME LIMITS. ON OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM OVERSIGHT FUNCTION. THE COURTS DECIDE THAT THE COURTS DECIDE THAT BUT IT WILL NOT GO VERY WELL WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE ASKING US TO PERFORMANCE? WE'RE COMING OUT OF A HORT TERM LIMITED ERA AND I THINK THE ASSEMBLY ESPECIALLY HAD NOT REALLY DONE ITS JOB FOR A LONG TIME. WITH THAT OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION. THOSE OF US HERE NOW HAVE A LITTLE LONGER HORIZON AND ARE TRYING TO TAKE SOME OF THAT SERIOUSLY SO WE'RE LEARNING. WHICH AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO OUR JOBS NOT JUST PASSED BILLS WHICH OF WE IF NOTHING ELSE TO DO WE'RE GONNA PASSED BILLS AND WE DO THAT AD NAUSEUM AND WE PASS BILLS THAT DON'T. ALWAYS MAKE MUCH SENSE BUT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN WE DON'T OR OVERSIGHT THAN THEY WERE SORT OF LEAVING BEHIND PART OF PART OF OUR OBLIGATION. SO I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THERE'S. A PATH HERE. THAT WE CAN GET SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS ALL. BUT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THIS IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO FOR US TO BUILD TO A BUDGET WE DO NEED. TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT YOU FACE. BUDGET RESOURCE CHALLENGES BUT FUNCTIONS HOW THINGS WORK HOW THINGS AREN'T WORKING. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS OF WHETHER WE THINK THAT'S GOOD BAD DIFFERENT AYE I DON'T REALLY KNOW IT THIS. AND. DON'T WANT OPEN UP SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO OPEN UP. BUT I ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE FEW WE WE SHOULD. AND SO THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE HERE. AND THE THE AUDITOR'S PERFORMING THEIR FUNCTION BECAUSE WE ASK THEM. AND THAT'S SORT OF A NORMAL WAY FOR US TO DO IT AND. BEFORE GONNA FIGHT OVER SEPARATE BRANCHES OF FOR UNIFIED OVER AUTHORITIES YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BY THAT LEAVES US WITH OUT MUCH TO WORK WITH AS WE TRY TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN WHERE. DECIDING. HOW TO HOW TO FUND THINGS HOW DO YOU OUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT A THREAT? OTHER BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY TAKE YOUR BUDGET BUDGET REQUESTS AT FACE VALUE. BUT I'M ASKING FOR HELP. HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR FUNCTIONS HOW YOU WORK. ASIDE SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHERE CONTROVERSY IS OR ISN'T AND? AND SO NOW YOU'RE LITIGANTS AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT THAT OUT IN THAT. THAT MAKES OUR JOB A WHOLE LOT HARDER HERE. TRY TO SORT THIS THROW. SO THAT'S I DON'T NO WHERE THIS LEAVES US SHORT TERM MAYBE WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS THING NOW TO BE RESOLVED IN COURT I AM I HAD HEARD BEEN DISAPPOINTED SUPREME COURT DID TAKE THIS UP AS I THOUGHT. THAT WOULD BE A FASTER PATH TO RESOLUTION. OF THESE QUESTIONS AND GET US TO PUT THIS THIS ULTIMATELY BEHIND US BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH JUST AS WE DO OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THEIR LITTLE MORE YOU DON'T LIKE IT EITHER BUT THERE THE MORE USE TO US PERFORMING SOME OF THAT FUNCTION AND WE GET GOOD ANSWERS AND WE HAVE. BUILT GOOD RELATIONSHIPS AND I AM BOUND AND DETERMINED TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JUDICIAL GRADS RECOGNIZING. SEPARATE CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. AS ARE WEAK AND AND WE HAVE OUR OBLIGATIONS OF. LEGISLATION YES BUT OVERSIGHT. GETTING QUESTIONS RAISED GETTING QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND FIGURING IT OUT AND WE EITHER DO THAT OPEN HEARINGS LIKE THIS. WE DO IT THROUGH THE AUDITOR WHICH CAN'T HOLD INFORMATION A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENTIAL. OR WERE SORT OF LEFT NOT KNOWING QUITE WHAT TO DO. SO MY PLEA IS LET'S FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS LET'S BY THE WAY TO GET MOVING FOR LET'S GET THE INFORMATION. INTO THE LEGISLATIVE CONTACTS PROTECT THE INFORMATION IS CONFIDENTIAL. AND IF WE DISAGREE WITH THAT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER SUBJECT WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATION AROUND. BUT HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTION OF OF THE C. JP AND THEN EITHER DEFEND WHAT YOU DO. WHICH I'D BE HAPPY TO DO. TO THE EXTENT I UNDERSTAND IT OR SEEK POLICY CHANGES. THAT ADDRESS LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS THAT THAT ULTIMATELY BE MAYBE REYES. BUT AS A POLICYMAKER EVEN SITTING ON OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HERE HAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THIS. AND I'M FRUSTRATED HAVING TWO WAY BUT EVEN IF WE WAIT A COUPLE YEARS ALSO BE HERE. AS ARE WILL STILL BE HERE SO WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO GET THERE BUT SO WE'LL GET THERE EVENTUALLY BUT LET'S GET THERE. FIND A WAY TO GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. TONY COMES MISTER LACKEY. ON SOME. SO HOPE YOU UNDER MISTER STONE WAS VERY ELOQUENT AND SHARING WITH YOU THE DILEMMA WE FACE ARE AS WE TALK ABOUT. OF C. JP AND AND WE'VE HAD SOMETIMES SIMILAR ISSUES OF FOLKS NINE ONE TO SHARE INFORMATION AND OWN WE DID A LOT GANG LIST WE ALMOST HAVE TO GO TO COURT ON THAT. BUT IT IT BUT THE. THE AUDITORS ARE ARE I REALLY. IS IT DOG REALLY AN ARM OF US IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED. OF KNOWING THAT THEY AND NONE OF US DOUBT THE ROLE OF EUROPE OF CONFIDENTIALITY. WITH REGARDS TO WHY YOU WANT TO KEEP CERTAIN THINGS CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT THE AUDITORS ARE ALSO INDIVIDUAL SWORN TO SOME LEVEL OF SICK OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AND HANDLING THE MATERIAL THAT'S THERE. ARE IN ORDER FOR US TO GET. THE PERSPECTIVE WE NEED ON HOW THINGS OPERATE I THINK THE THIS ALL UP COMMISSIONS EXIST AND CERTAIN SINCE WHAT SIXTY ONE OF SOMETHING. AND YOU NOT HAVE AN AUDIT DONE AT ALL. AND TO HAVE INTERNAL AUDITS OF THE WORDS YOU ARE ADDING YOURSELF WE FOUND THAT DOES DOESN'T WORK WELL I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE. SOME OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE WITH REGARD TO THE INFORMATION IS THERE NOW I KNOW THAT THE ALL MEMBERS OF THE C. JP CAN ALWAYS VOTE TO AMEND THE RULES IN ORDER TO ALLOW. THIS STATE AUDITOR'S TO BASICALLY LOOK AT THAT THE MATERIAL RULE ONE OUT TO MY UNDERSTANDING I WAS TOLD. AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU IF THE AS IT IS AN ORGANIZATION ONE EVEN DISCUSS THAT AS WITH THE NOT THAT WOULD BE. A AN OPTION AVAILABLE TO ALL TOO MANY RULES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS AMENDING THE RULES AS WELL TEN. A TEN POINT FIVE TO DISCLOSE PAYMENTS MADE BY. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO SETTLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES SO THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT DO EXIST IN AND AND AND. IN THIS SO IT ARENA AND I WOULD IMAGINE HAVING NEVER BEEN ASKED TO DO AN AUDIT IN WHAT'S IN SIXTY ONE. WHICH IS A VERY LONG TIME. WHAT ALMOST FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FIFTY YEARS OF FIFTY YEARS NEVER HAVING AN AUDIT PROBLEM NOBODY ASKED TO? WEAR THE RULES. APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY ENTITY THAT ASK THAT NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO DATA THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THAT YOU HAVE. SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR OUR ISSUES MEGA SAID IN AND AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS AMENDING ITS RULESBECAUSE THIS OTHER PIECE IN TERMS OF PAYMENTS. THAT WENT OUT ON ISSUES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT TRADITIONALLY WOULD NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE THIS. A RULE CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AND WOULD NOT WANT YOU NOT TO HAVE IT. HAVING NEVER BEEN ASKED TO DO AN AUDIT YOU PROBABLY NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. AND. AFTER FIFTY SOME ODD YEARS OF TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE IN A LEGITIMATE POSITION LIKE THE LEGISLATURE THAT BASICALLY IS OVERSIGHT BODY. OF THAT FUNDS ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE WE OFTEN CALL FOUGHT IT'S ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO. A NOW BECAUSE OF THE FACT pMUCH MORE. A RESPONSIVE TO THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHEN TRYING TO COME WATCH OR SPONSORED TO THE BUDGET THAT THEY REQUEST AND MAKE YOU SHOULD NOT THAT WE CUT BUDGETS WOULD BE IF WE CAN AUGMENT BUDGETS AND GOOD TIMES. IT'S IMPORTED DO THAT TO YOU YOU MENTION THAT YOU'VE GOT A BACKLOG A YOU'VE BEEN CUT TEN PERCENT. HAVE A BACKLOG OF CASES MAY NOW BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW OF A IF WHETHER NOT TO AND AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE IS ABOUT. NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT I THINK IN THE REPORT FATHER EITHER CLOSED AFTER INITIAL REVIEW A CLOSE WITH THAT THIS POSITION. AFTER INVESTIGATION SO I'M NOT AND I ASSUME THAT'S A GOOD THING I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD OF ME WE OFTEN HAVE. FOLKS WHO. WOULD HAVE THESE HIGH NUMBERS IN THOSE NOT GOOD NUMBERS. AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. YOU HAVE NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE COMPLAINTS BEING FILED. HAVING NO RESOLUTION TO A MORE NEEDS NO ONE NO ACTION TAKEN BY IN THAT SAME SET SO. HAS YOUR ORGANIZATION THOUGHT ABOUT WAVING THE RULES I SHOULD GUESS I SHOULD ASK ALL SINCE YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. JUST A. JUST BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR BUT THERE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE STATUTORY SCHEME ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS. ONCE THEY'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE AUDITOR. AND SECTION EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE STATES THAT. RECORDS IN THE HANDS OF THE AUDITOR ARE PUBLIC RECORDS AND EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE C. TALKS ABOUT. DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE BUT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN RELIED UPON FOR REPORTS THAT THE AUDITOR. R. RENDERS ARE SUBJECT ARE SUBJECT TO. DISCLOSURE THROUGH. THROUGH RECORD REQUESTS UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND SO EVEN IT AND I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS AN AT BEST AMBIGUOUS. AND THEN WOULD PUT CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS IN THE HANDS OF THE AUDITOR AT RISK OF REQUEST AND DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO. THAT WHAT THE COMMISSION NEEDS IS IT NEED CERTAINTY THAT ALL CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS IN THE HANDS OF AUDITOR COULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. AND THEN. AND AND ALONG WITH THAT YES THE THERE COULD BE ARE AT IT AN AMENDMENT TO RULE ONE NO TWO BUT THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD HAVE TO GO TOGETHER. MADAM CHAIR IF I MONEY. IT'S ARMS. DOES IT THAT'S IT TO TO GET THAT AT THE END OF. WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH IN IN THE BACK AND FORTH BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND I THINK THE AUDITOR CAN HELP. EXPLAIN AND I DON'T NOT SURE THAT. THE RULES NEED TO BE CHANGED I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. DIRECT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. REQUIRES WHAT SOME THE EXEMPTIONS ARE BECAUSE OTHERWISE. THE OTTER COULD NOT PERFORM THEIR FUNCTION THAT WE ASK THEM TO ON A REGULAR BASIS IS WE'RE NOT. IN INSTRUCTING THE AUDITOR TO GO GET RECORDS WHETHER IT'S FROM TGP OR ANYBODY ELSE IN ORDER TO VIOLATE CONFIDENTIALITY OR MAKE RECORDS. PUBLIC THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE PUBLIC THAT'S THAT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE LEGISLATURE OR ANYONE HERE AND SO YEAH FOR ME I THINK THESE MECHANISMS EXIST OUT LIKE TO GET THE AUDITOR TO RESPOND. THANK YOU OF THEY ABSOLUTELY EXIST EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE POINT TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. THAT HANDING US CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS OR PRIVILEGED RECORDS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVILEGE. AB FIVE FORTY FIVE POINT TWO MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AS WELL THAT WE STAND IN THE SHOES OF OUR ODDITY WHICH MEANS THAT FOR PURPOSES OF ACCESS WE ARE JUST LIKE ANY OF YOU. AND WE HAVE A COMPANION DUTY TO PROTECT THAT INFORMATION THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DO. THEREFORE IF WE GOT US A SUPER REQUEST FOR YOUR CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. FIRST THING THAT WOULD WE WOULD DO IF WE DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THE RECORDS WERE CONFIDENTIAL IS TO COMPARE WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RECORDS IN QUESTION. CAN BE RELEASED AND IF NOT WE WOULD ASSERT BE EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE LAW ALL THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US TO PROTECT THOSE THAT THAT INFORMATION WE WOULD INVITE YOU TO PARTICIPATE AS THE REAL PARTY OF INTEREST IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE SUED. WE OBTAIN THOUSANDS OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE RECORDS AND PRIVILEGED CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LETTER LEVEL IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE DO NOT RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. WE WOULD NOT RELEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS WE COULDN'T IT WOULD BE A CRIME. NOBODY WANTS COMMIT A CRIME AGAINST AND JUDGE THIS VISION. SO I. I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A FORM TO GO BACK FOR THAT WITHIN CITY I JUST WANTED TO GET THE TWO PERSPECTIVES OUT THERE YEAH BECAUSE THIS THIS IS. THIS IS OUR FRUSTRATION IF WE WANT TO COMPLETE OUR WORK OF GETTING AN AUDIT DONE. BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT SEE JP WHETHER THEY'RE REAL WHETHER THEY'RE NOT REAL THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS ABOUT AND WHETHER. WE NEED TO WEIGH IN OR NOT. FOR ONE I'M NOT CONVINCED WE NEED TO CHANGE THINGS. I'M HOPING THAT. ABSENT THE LAWSUIT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PARTIES COULD FIGURE THIS OUT. AND BUT BECAUSE A LAWSUIT IS THERE. YOU ARE ALSO LITIGANTS AND ACTING LIKE LITIGANTS AS AS I WOULD EXPECT BUT THAT IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FRUSTRATE. OUR GOAL HERE WHICH IS TO GET. RELIABLE INFORMATION THIRD PARTY INFORMATION THE AUDITOR. ABOUT THAT THE WAY THAT CGP OPERATES IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE BUDGETARY AND POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOT WORRY ABOUT. SO OUR GOAL IS NOT TO VARIOUS. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO. FORCE YOU TO RELEASE RECORDS OF PUBLIC IT SEE THAT THAT YOU WOULD WANT. NOT WHAT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. OUR GOAL IS TO GET INFORMATION WE FEW WE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT THAT ARE BEFORE US AND WHETHER IT'S BUDGETARY DECISIONS. WHICH IS HERE OR ITS POLICY DECISIONS WHICH WOULD GO THROUGH MY COMMITTEE SEPARATE FROM. THIS THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'S. THAT'S THE GOAL HERE AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING. WHAT I'M ASKING FELLOW SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR WERE FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IS? HOW DO WE GET THERE AND THE LOOK FOR AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S OUR? GOAL IS LET'S GET US THERE. LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT WE CAN DO OUR JOB. AND LET'S SEE JP DO ITS JOB LET THE ODDITY. OKAY DO IN A PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS MATTER OH BOY IT WE DO GOOD. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOU EACH HAVE A MINUTE TO. BUT THEN IF YOU WITHIN YOUR POSITION AND WALKED. MY NAME IS STEVE RUSSELL'S I'M A LOCAL ATTORNEY. MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE STATE BAR HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I'VE BEEN THE VICTIM OF ABUSE BY A LOCAL JUDGE. HE WAS EVENTUALLY SANCTIONED BY THE C. JP. BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. THE STATEMENTS HE MADE TO THE CPAP WERE NOT TRUTHFUL. AND IF I HAD BEEN CALLED TO TESTIFY WITH MY RECORD SHE WOULD BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS ROPE. MANY GROSS VIOLATIONS ON AT LEAST FIVE OF MY CASES ALONE. MORE THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS MY WASTED TIME. FIFTEEN TWENTY THOUSAND CASH OUT OF POCKET JUST IN THOSE CASES. I WISHED I TALKED TO A SYMBIOTIC KP INVESTIGATORWAS TOLD WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO GET COPIES OF THESE RECORDS OF THESE CASES. THAT LEAVES IT TO ME. I DID I'M SINGLE PLAYER I DON'T HAVE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF TRYING. THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF CASH OUT OF POCKET TO GO GET CERTIFIED COPIES OF THESE RECORDS SO THAT I CAN EVEN PRESENTER CASE IN THE C. JP. AND THAT'S ONLY ONE JUDGE OF SEVERAL THAT HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN INVOLVED WITH. ANOTHER LOCAL JUDGE STILL SITTING TODAY SCREAMED AT ME DURING A CHILD SUPPORT HEARING INSTEAD. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH. TRUTH IS NOT RELEVANT IN MY COURTROOM. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS COMPROMISE FOR EXPEDIENCY I BASE MY DECISIONS ON WHO I BELIEVE IS THE BEST LIAR. I CHALLENGED HIM ON THIS WITH SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DISQUALIFY ME SAYS I DON'T REMEMBER IT. WELL I DO HE COULD'VE SLAPPED ME ACROSS THE FACE AND DOUGLAS SHOCK. MY BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE CJ P. NEEDS THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT THESE VALID INVESTIGATIONS. I COULD SUPPLY THEM WITH TEN OR TWELVE CASES BUT THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RICK SIMPSON. A RECENT RETIRED ME FROM THE LEGISLATURE ARM AND UP UNTIL JANUARY IT WAS A PUBLIC MEMBER. OF THE C. JP I WAS A SPEAKERS APPOINTEE FOR ABOUT ONE HALF YEARS. AND SERVED AS ITS VICE CHAIR AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I'M I THINK MR STONE. CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL. PARENT CONFLICT WITH IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE THAT THAT GOVERNS THE CGP. ARM THAT THE EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE POINT TO THE AUDITOR REFERENCE SPEECH TO THE INABILITY OF AUDIT STAFF THAT THEY STAND THE SHOES OF THE AGENCY. ARM. THE AGENCY IS NOT SUBJECT THE SUBJECT IS NOT SUBJECT TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WITH RESPECT THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. AND THERE IS A THERE ARE THE OTHER SECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE SAYS EXPLICITLY AS MR DRESSER SAID. THAT ALL BOOKS PAPERS RECORDS CORRESPONDENCE OF THE OFFICE PERTAINING TO HIS WORK ARE PUBLIC RECORD SUBJECT TO THAN THE REFERENCE OF PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THERE ARE FOUR EXCEPTIONS IN THE CODE SECTION NOT A PUSHED APPLY. BJP'S TYPE RECORD SO THERE IS A AN APPARENT. CONFLICT BETWEEN THE THE AUDITOR'S STAFF OBLIGATION TO NOT DISCLOSE MATERIAL ON THE ONE HAND VERSUS THE AGENCIES OBLIGATIONS OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION I THINK THAT'S. THE THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF THE CONFLICT. AND I THINK OF WOULD CONCUR WITH MISTER STONE THAT. RESOLVING THAT. NO OF DIFFERENCE OF VIEW ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CODE DOESN'T DOESN'T REQUIRE. IS IS WHAT WOULD WOULD HELP MITNICK THIS MOVES ON THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRPERSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEVIN LITTLE I'M AN ATTORNEY FROM FRESNO CALIFORNIA. THE REASON I'M HERE TO SPEAK TODAY IS BECAUSE I AM AND WHAT I THINK IS A SOMEWHAT UNIQUE POSITION THAT I HAVE REPRESENTED. A COMPLAINANT. IN A MATTER PENDING WITH THE C. JP AND I ALSO HAVE BEEN. IN ANOTHER INSTANCE A POTENTIAL WITNESS. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVES THAT. I IT IS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. TWO HALF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ARE REPRESENT SOMEONE. WHO IS PROVIDED INFORMATION REGARDING A JUDICIAL OFFICER BECAUSE OF THE AWESOME POWER? THAT JUDICIAL OFFICERS HOLE. COMPLAINANTS. PROVIDE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC CASE. VERY DETAILED INFORMATION TWO INVESTIGATORS INCLUDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION ALL HEALTH INFORMATION. PHYSICAL HEALTH INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION TO HELP SUBSTANTIATE THEIR COMPLAINTS. THOSE COMPLAINANTS DO NOT WANT TO. BE TOLD. THAT. THERE INFORMATION WILL LIKELY BE HELD CONFIDENTIAL. IN RESPONSE TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE TOLD. THAT. WHAT THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF LITIGATION REGARDING SUCH RECORDS IS THEY WANT TO BE TOLD THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE? THAT THEIR INFORMATION COULD BE TURNED OVER. I I CANNOT TELL YOU HAVING STOOD IN ISSUES OF BOTH A POTENTIAL WITNESS AND A REPRESENT OF OF THE COMPLAINANT. THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT WOULD OCCUR. I IF. THERE WERE. NO ABSOLUTE LUKE CONFIDENTIALITY THAT COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED TO COMPLAINANTS AND UNDER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW. THERE SIMPLY IS NOT. THANK YOU THINKING IF YOU. HI MY NAME IS CONNIE VALENTINE AND FROM CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION. AND THE TAXPAYER ALONG WITH CALIFANO THE REST THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. AND FUNDING THE CJ P. AND FINDING THE PSA. AND FUNDING THE LITIGATION AND I'M PUTTING THE LEGISLATURE. IT'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF EMPLOYEES ON MY PAYROLL. I'M THE LEGISLATURE AS THE ESTATE OF AUDIT THE CIVIC PETE. BJP SUED THE BSA. I THINK THAT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. IT WAS ALARMING TO HERE TODAY. ABOUT HOW FRIGHTENED EVERYONE IS OF JUDGES THAT ALARMS ME. BUT IS A SOLUTION I'M THINKING MAYBE BOTH PARTIES COULD GO TO MEDIATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON KATHLEEN RUSSELL WITH THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE WE. A WORD INITIALLY THE GROUP THAT BROUGHT THIS AUDIT ALONG WITH TWENTY ONE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE PUBLIC. SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO GET LOST IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION. THAT OWNS ASCII YOU CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEN DOUBLE ACP. SACRAMENTO CHAPTER AMONG OTHER GROUPS JOINED US IN SAYING THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ITS JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT AGENCY. AND THE C. JP MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND YET AS MADAM CHAIR POINTED OUT LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT. PUBLIC LITIGANT COMPLAINTS AND UP IN ANY SORT OF JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE. THE C. JP IS DIRECTED MUCH TOO FAR OVER THE FIFTY SIX YEARS OF NOT BEING AUDITED. TO ITS MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN. THAT NEEDS TO STOP AND JUST TO. WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF JUDICIAL ARROGANCE AND OBFUSCATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE SENATOR LENO PUT THROUGH AN AUDIT OF TO. FAMILY COURT SACRAMENTO IN MARIN COUNTY THE AUDITOR WAS KEPT FOR TEN MONTHS FROM GETTING IN TO DO HER JOB AND NOT AUDIT THEY HAD TO THREATEN SUBPOENAS. IN ORDER TO ACCESS THOSE RECORDS AND IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE SHREDDING PARTY DURING THOSE TEN MONTHS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ACTUALLY WROTE A REPORT. BASICALLY SAYING IN RETROSPECT THAT IT WAS ALL OKAY WITH THEM THAT THESE DOCUMENTS WERE DESTROYED AND THESE WERE. COURT RECORDS THAT WERE ROUTINELY SUBPOENAED IN ON LEGAL MATTERS SO THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HIDING AN OBFUSCATING AND THIS NOTION THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY. FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE LONG HISTORY OF JUDICIAL. YOU KNOW SECRECY THANK YOU THANK YOU YEAH. I GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M THOMAS A CURRY. I'M A COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM SPEAKING AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN TODAY. I'M FIRST ALERT VERY MUCH AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. HE WAS RIGHT ON POINT AND I JUST WANT TO BRING UP A FEW ADDITIONAL POINTS OUT BUT BUT I'D PARTICULARLY WANT TO COMMEND HIM FOR HIS COME ABOUT OVERSIGHT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE WITH RESPECT TO OVERSIGHT. AS WELL AS ITS INVESTIGATIVE CAPACITY NOT ONLY ITS LEAD ITS LAWMAKING CAPACITY. YOU KNOW JUDGE YOU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT PERCEPTION THAT THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION IS THAT THE C. JP IS SECRETIVE. WHY WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT? THEY ARE IN FACT SECRETIVE AN EXCESSIVELY SECRETIVE OF THEIR NOT SUBJECT AS WE LEARN TODAY IF TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ARE NOT SUBJECT THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT. THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE A TEN POINT FIVE HUNDRED WHICH YOU MENTIONED MADAM CHAIR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS ACQUITTED OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. I COULD GO ON WITH ALL THE THINGS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SUNSHINE ACT PROP FIFTY NINE ARTICLE ONE SECTION THREE BE. SO. YOU KNOW IT OFTEN JUDGE YOU PERCEPTION AS YOU KNOW IS IS REALITY OFTEN. AND SO I'M I WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMENT THE OTHER THING IS THE TAXPAYER MONEY THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS AYE AYE TOUMA TAXPAYER. ON ONLY POINT OUT THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE HIRED HIGH POWERED A LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS IS COST THE TAXPAYERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. ON BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR AS WELL AS THE C. JP IS A WELL RESPECTED APPELLATE ATTORNEYS AND HERE WE HAVE ONGOING LITIGATION I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE EXACT. AMOUNT THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO COST THE TAXPAYERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THIS LAWSUIT COME UP PLEASE YES I'LL BE HAPPY TO ARM. AND AND FINALLY. IT SEEMS AS IF HE'S ASKING FOR TWO AND FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS. BUDGET CYCLE ARM AND I PERSONALLY WOULD WOULD SUPPORT AT THAT AND IT EVEN ADDITIONAL MONEY BUT WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY. ARE MEETING AND THEIR GOALS AND THEIR AM ACTING EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. AND IN FULLY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND I JUST WILL ALSO SAY THAT IT'S FIFTY SEVEN YEARS I THINK THE CTP BUT EXISTENCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU WHO. YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE HOPEFULLY. THANK YOU. KATHERINE CAMPBELL I'M WITH CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION BUT I'M HERE TODAY AS A CITIZEN. IT IS CHILLING TO STAND IN A COURT IN HERE A JUDGE. GIVE CUSTODY. OF A CHILD TO AN ABUSER. THAT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME. AND AS MS RUSSELL SPOKE. THAT THIS ODYSSEUS BROUGHT TOGETHER. BECAUSE PEOPLE CAME FORWARD AND SAID THIS ISN'T WORKING. PUBLIC CAME FORWARD TO SAY. OUR CHILDREN ARE BEING HURT. AND THERE IS SECRECY. YOU IN MY OPINION THIS IS HIDING. AND IN MY OPINION I HEARD THAT THE AUDITORS SAID THAT THAT YOUR RECORDS ARE COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL. TODAY. SO I'M CONCERNED IF WE WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM AND NUMBER ONE. IF YOU DON'T SUMMIT. TO HAVING ALL THE COMPLAINTS BE SHOWN TO THE AUDITOR. I FEEL AS IF YOU ARE WASTING TAXPAYERS MONEY AT THIS POINT NOT ESPECIALLY WHAT WE HEARD TODAY. AND I FEEL IS IF WE DO NOT MOVE FORWARD AYE WITH A DECISION TO GET ALL THESE COMPLAINTS I DON'T FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BE. FUNDED UNTIL WE. ATTACKED THE PEOPLE I'VE HEARD YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AND I CAN TELL YOU WE HEAR PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED THEY GET A FORM LETTER BACK. IT SAYS THIS WAS DISMISSED AND THEY HAD VERY VERY. PERFECT INFORMATION TO SHOW WHY THIS JUDGE WAS AN ERROR. AND WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO CONTINUE WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE STRONG WE WANT STRONG JUDGES. AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT JUDGES STRONG AT THIS POINT YOU'RE ALLOWING THEM. TO BE THE WILD WEST AND THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. I THINK WE'VE HAD. WIDE RANGE OF COMMENTS CONCERNING IT OF. OUR OUR CONCERN AS WE POINTED OUT AS MISTER STONE POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE. POINT OUT THAT OF WHICH. I WASN'T ON THE COMMITTEE THAT TIME THIS WAS DONE THE REQUEST FOR THE AUDIT. BUT SURELY IF WE ARE. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OVERSIGHT. WE HAVE THE PUBLIC WHO COMES AND BRINGS ISSUES TO US AND AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY REQUEST AN AUDIT. OF TO CONTINUE THE FUN THINGS THAT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF CERTAINTY THAT. IT'S OPERATING IN AND IN A MANNER THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT. OF WE REQUEST AUDITS OF ALL KINDS OF THINGS. AND. BUT I HAVE YET TO HAVE ANYONE REPORT THAT ALL THE MATERIAL AN AUDIT GOT OUT IN THE PUBLIC AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND WE'VE HAD SOME SENSITIVE AUDITS. AUDITOR'S GENERALLY A VERY PROOF EFFICIENT AND PROFICIENT WHAT THEY DO SO UP AS POINT MRS DON'T WE WOULD LOVE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT A CONCLUSION. THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AUDIT AND THE FACT THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS AND WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THE AUDIT TO TO MAKE THE ORGANIZATION BETTER? THAT THAT THE THAT THE. THE UP COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING THOSE ITEMS SO I THINK OF THE ISSUES A CLEAR. WHAT WE WANT DONE WE WANT TO TRY TO GET THIS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE? OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR NOT GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR AGENDA WHICH OF THE VOTE ONLY ITEMS. AND.
