THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PRESENTING AB THREE THREE FOUR AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD MELANOMA I KNOW HOW SCARY THAT DIAGNOSIS CAN BE. THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE HITS HOME FOR ME AB THREE THIRTY FOUR WILL ESTABLISH A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS SKIN CANCER DEVELOP I CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE OFFICERS AND PARK RANGERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE TO THE SUN DURING THEIR EMPLOYMENT. IT WOULD REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS FOR CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE OFFICERS A PARK RANGERS TO QUALIFY FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH SKIN CANCER IT WOULD REDUCE THE DEPARTMENTS OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL AS PARKS AND RECREATION'S EFFORTS TO INITIATE AND COMPLETE A WORKERS COMPENSATION. INVESTIGATION ON ITS CLAIMS. DOUG HAWKINS RETIRED FISH AND WILDLIFE ASSISTANT CHIEF WHO HAS HAD TO HAVE THREE SKIN CANCER SURGERIES EXPLAINS THE NECESSITY OF THIS BILL WELL. HE WRITES SKIN CANCER WAS ALWAYS A CONCERN TO ME BOTH DURING AND AFTER MY THIRTY TWO YEARS AS A WARDEN ESPECIALLY HAVING SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS DAYS AND WEEKS AT SEA ON PATROL. I REGULARLY APPLIED SUNBLOCK AT THE SHEER AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN THE SUN JUST SEEMS TO OVERWHELM EFFORTS TO KEEP SKIN CANCER AT BAY. AS YOU KNOW WARDEN'S HIKE SWEAT AND OPERATE A VERY DIRTY ENVIRONMENTS FOR ENDLESS HOURS AS A RESULT BOTH SKIN BLOCK CREAM SEEM TO HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF REMAINING IN PLACE THROUGHOUT A PATROL. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT GOOD DATA IS ANYTIME A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION IS BEING DISCUSSED LAST FEBRUARY I REQUESTED A COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION CHISWICK STUDY ON THE PREVALENCE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR SKIN CANCER FOR WILDLIFE OFFICERS A PARK RANGERS. AND WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCEPTED CLAIMS VERSUS DENIED CLAIMS WERE AND HOW EXCESSIVE SUN EXPOSURE MAY INCREASE THE INCIDENCE OF SKIN CANCER AMONG THESE PARTICULAR WORKERS. UNFORTUNATELY WE ALL KNOW HOW LAST YEAR TURNED OUT AND SO THE STUDY HAS BEEN DELAYED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN MY OFFICE HAS SPOKEN TO THE DIRECTOR CHISWICK SEVERAL TIMES AND HE'S ASSURED US THAT THE STUDY IS A PRIORITY FOR THEM. AND THAT THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO COMPLETE IT IN DUE TIME. SO I AM COMMITTING MISTER CHAIR SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY BUT I WILL NOT MOVE IT OUT OF THE SENATE WITHOUT THAT STUDY. IN HAND I TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ONLY MOVING FORWARD WITH A BILL THAT THE SCIENCE BACKS UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE. A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF ALLEN FOUGHT MELANOMA AND THEN HE ALSO FOUGHT THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND HE THANKFULLY WAS ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN THAT EFFORT AND THAT DECISION TO DENY THE WORKERS COMP COVERAGE WAS OVERTURNED. JUST ONLY WEEKS BEFORE HE LOST HIS LIFE TO MELANOMA BUT HE DID KNOW THAT HIS- HIS WIFE AND SURVIVING CHILDREN WERE GOING TO RECEIVE BETTER BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THAT. DECISION ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I COULD PERSONALLY NO LONGER IGNORE THE SCALY LESIONS ON MY ARMS THAT JUST WOULDN'T GO AWAY I NOW HAVE A RECORD OF FIVE- SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS IN ONE BASAL CELL CARCINOMA REMOVED OFF OF MY- ARMS MY FACE AND MY NECK.

I'M ONE OF MANY FELLOW WILDLIFE OFFICERS OR EXPERIENCE THE SAME- WE HAVE PROVIDED SEVERAL PUBLISHED STUDIES TO SUPPORT OCCUPATIONAL SUN EXPOSURE AND- TO. THAT IT CONTRIBUTES TO SKIN CANCER.

GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THAT CONCLUDES OUR- WITNESS TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSE TESTIMONY COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL MR FRAZIER AS QUESTION. YES MATURE THANK YOU QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WHEREAS WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXPOSURE LEVELS THAT THE WARDENS ARE TAKING. AS WHICH IS YOU KNOW. UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY'VE BEEN HIT WITH A SELECTION WHAT IS THE AGENCY DOING AS A RISK MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE OR TRY TO HELP THIS AS A PREVENTION MEASURE- GOING FORWARD SO THE YOU KNOW. WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PRESUMPTION WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM BEING AFFLICTED. WHAT WHAT CAN THE AGENCY DO TO BETTER PROTECT. THE WARDENS. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- NEVER FRAZIER- I DON'T HAVE A PRECISE ANSWER FOR YOU NOT KNOWING THOSE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS I DO KNOW THERE IS AN INTERNAL EVIDENCE THAT HAS PROMPTED THIS DISCUSSION THAT HAS PROMPTED THIS THERE'S A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS WITHIN THESE DEPARTMENTS AMONG THESE OFFICERS THAT THIS IS INDEED A RISK THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING. CHALLENGE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEIR- IT'S VERY MUCH- WHILE THERE'S AN AWARENESS THERE IT'S VERY MUCH UP TO THESE OFFICES ON THEIR OWN TO TAKE A SERIES OF PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE AGAINST THE UV RAYS SELL- CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA BUT- IT IN MY WAY OF THINKING IT JUST STANDS TO REASON. THAT THIS HEIGHTENED RISK OF HAS LED TO THIS BILL BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS BASED IN SCIENCE AS THE CHAIR IS INDICATED AS I'VE INDICATED OF AND WE WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD UNLESS THE SCIENCE BACKS UP. THIS INTERNAL EVIDENCE. WHAT MISTER LOAN SO WHAT AND I AGREE WITH YOU I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT AFFECTION FOR AFFECTED BY THEIR THEIR WORK THAT THEY SHOULD BE COVERED ABSOLUTELY I'VE BEEN A HUNTER FOR FIFTY ONE YEARS AND HAVE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES IN THE OUTDOORS BECAUSE OF THIS AGENCY. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS. HOW PROACTIVE IN OUR ROLE AS OVERSIGHT OF THIS AGENCY CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROTECT THESE PUBLIC SERVICE. ADMINISTRATOR I MISS CHAIR IF I MAY UM IF PAT COULD MORE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED- THAT QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE FOR THE BASIC THINGS LIKE HATS BUT IT HITS REALLY VERY MUCH A TO THE WORKERS THEMSELVES FOR CERTAIN PROTECTIONS BUT PAT DO YOU HAVE A AN ADDITIONAL ANSWER ON THAT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR UNIFORM POLICY ON COURSE AUTHORIZES LONG SLEEVES WHICH MANY OF US I'VE BEEN WEARING LONG SLEEVES FOR OUTDOOR WORK FOR YEARS NOW. ADD I CERTAINLY HATS- BUT SUNSCREEN IS REALLY THE PRIMARY TOOL WE HAVE BUT THE PROBLEM WITH SUNSCREEN IS THAT SALT SPRAY- JUST DIRT GRIME SWEAT- WEARING LONG SLEEVES IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER IS IT JUST MISERABLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THEN IT WASHES OFF IT GETS WASHED UP WITH THE DIRT AND SWEAT. AND DEFINITELY THE SALT SPRAY SO IT'S JUST IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL ARE AWARE OF THE DEPARTMENT DOES. THEY MAKE SURE WE ARE AWARE OF THAT AUTHORIZING THE HATS AUTHORIZING LONG SLEEVES BUT IT JUST IT USUALLY JUST NOT ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT. MR FRAZIER. ARE YOU. GOOD GOOD AND- MISTER COOPER- GOOD GOOD ANY OTHER COMMITTEE COMMENTS- WELL TO THE MEMBER FROM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO- WE'VE HAD A PRETTY THOROUGH DISCUSSION IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD AND CLOSING- NOVATION CHAIR JUST APPRECIATE YOU ENTERTAINING- THIS POLICY AND AGAIN THAT- REITERATE THE COMMITMENT ABOUT THE STUDY ON THE SENATE SIDE.

GRAYSON AYE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE VOEPEL VOEPEL I WOULD. TEN ZERO. THERE WAS A TEN ZERO VOTE WITH A FEW MEMBERS YET TO ADD ON WITH THEIR VOTE THANK YOU. MISTER MOLOT. THE NEXT BILL IS- AB ONE TEN BY MISS PETRI NORRIS. THE MEMBER FROM LAGUNA BEACH CALIFORNIA. PART OF THE OC DELEGATION LIKE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB ONE TEN WHICH IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT Q. CROSS CHECK UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST INCARCERATION. CONSTITUENTS HAVE WATCHED WITH HORROR AND OUTRAGE THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH I CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS FAILED CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES WAS THE- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ESTIMATED NOW TO BE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FRAUD RELATED TO PAYMENTS TO. IN THE NAMES OF INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS IN A RECENT STATE AUDIT BY THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED THE FACT THAT THE REASON THAT THIS FAILURE OCCURRED IS THAT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO CROSS CHECK CLAIMS AGAINST INCARCERATION RECORDS SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO CLOSE THAT CRITICAL GAP AND ENSURE THAT TAX WE AVOID A FRAUD TO BOTTLE LIKE THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN IT'S A SIMPLE AND COMMON SENSE APPROACH AND DATA. COMMONSENSE STEP WITH THAT I AM PLEASED. TO INTRODUCE FOR TESTIMONY. LESLIE YOUNG WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ORANGE COUNTY. GOOD THANK YOU. MS YOUNG ARE YOU ON THE PHONE LINE. YES I AM YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LESLIE YOUNG ORANGE COUNTY ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CHARGE OF MAJOR FRAUD ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODD SPITZER I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB ONE TEN. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPENCER DIRECTED THE MAJORITY OF OUR FRAUD UNITS RESOURCES BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BY INMATES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS OUR OFFICE UNCOVERED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PAID TO THE INMATES COCONSPIRATORS IN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE. WE FILED MULTIPLE FELONY CHARGES AGAINST EIGHT INDIVIDUALS IN THE SCHEME BUT DESPITE NUMEROUS BANK SEARCH WARRANTS AND OTHER INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS TO FRAUDULENTLY DIVERTED FUNDS HAD VANISHED. ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE OBTAINING RESTITUTION ORDERS ON BEHALF OF EDT THE REALITY IS THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF THAT MONEY WILL NEVER BE RETURNED TO TAXPAYERS. DURING OUR EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION WE LEARNED THAT THESE EIGHT SUSPECTS BY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF A RAMPANT STATEWIDE FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS SCHEME INVOLVING STATE PRISONER APPLICANTS. HAD A MECHANISM BEEN IN PLACE TO BLOCK THIS MONEY FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INELIGIBLE PRISON INMATES UNTOLD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFEGUARDED AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES DEVOTED ELSEWHERE. AB ONE TEN IS A COMMONSENSE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN MINIMIZING THE LOSS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FRAUD. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO HELP OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS NOT TO ENRICH INCARCERATED CRIMINALS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES. WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB ONE TEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS YOUNG- DOES THE MEMBER FROM LAGUNA BEACH HAVE ANY OTHER SUPPORT WITNESSES- WE DO NOT. THANK YOU. THEN THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPPOSE A WITNESS WHO HAS NOTIFIED US IN ADVANCE- MISS KATIE DIXON ARE YOU ON THE PHONE. YES GOOD MORNING I'M HERE. GO AHEAD MYSTICS IN. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRED DALY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALIKE AND THANK YOU AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS AND ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ARE CALLED SPONSORING OR CO AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. MY NAME IS KATIE DIXON I'M A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK I'M A FORMERLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY HERE TO OPPOSE AB ONE FAN. LEGAL AID AT WORK IS A NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION I HAVE BEEN ASSISTING LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. AND AS A PART OF OUR SERVICES WE INVITE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALSO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS ARE WRONGFULLY DENIED THESE BENEFITS. WE APOLOGIZE AB ONE FAN WHICH REQUIRES ACROSS MATCH AND VERIFICATION SYSTEM BY SHARING THE NINETY FOUR SECURITY NUMBER OF PEOPLE BETWEEN CDC ARE. AN EDT BEFORE MAKING ANY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS THAT THE CLAIMANT IS NOT CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PERSON. WE ARE ALL TROUBLED BY THE RECENT INCIDENTS OF FRAUD. BUT I ALSO WANT FOLKS TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT INCARCERATED PEOPLE WERE VICTIMS OF THIS FRAUD AND HAD THEIR INFORMATION USED TO APPLY FOR THESE BENEFITS WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT. DESPITE THE TROUBLING NATURE OF THIS RECENT ACTIVITY BCFS WERE FAR LARGELY LIMITED TO THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT THE EDT ITSELF IS ESTIMATED AT ROUGHLY 95% OF BROUGHT WERE PAID OUT WITH THIS PROGRAM. THE REMAINING 5% HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE REGULAR U. Y. PROGRAM. WOW WE DO WANT TO SEE THIS IF THIS BUSY BENEFITS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA. NEVER THE LESS PROVIDING EDT ACCESS TO INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF YOU WHY PROGRAM VERIFICATION IS NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL MAY PREVENT LEGITIMATE CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND LEAD TO THE WRONGFUL DENIAL OF A CRITICAL SAFETY NET FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. WHO ALREADY FACE PARTICULARLY HARDSHIP WHEN GETTING BACK INTO THE LABOR MARKET INTO THE LABOR MARKET EXCUSE ME. WHAT CONCERNS THE BILL WILL LEAD TO THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE DELAYS ARE PORTING AND OR ERRORS. RECORDKEEPING ERRORS IN OUR IN OUR STATE- JUSTICE SYSTEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED. THE NUMBER OF INACCURACIES INCOMPLETE BALLOT IN A LACK OF CONTINUUM OF CARE. IS THE AS HIS FRIENDS MADE ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PLATFORMS IS A SOUND. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STUDY REPORT. THE AVERAGE OF AND A MISSING DISPOSITION INFORMATION. THAT THE HIGH NUMBER. THE REQUIREMENT THAT HE BE NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT CDC ARE WHEN THEY DETERMINE OR THINK OF CLAIMING IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. IT'S ALSO TROUBLING TO US AS IT IS ALSO READY AS THEY ALSO CALLED FOR AN ADDITIONAL USE OF ALREADY LIMITED EDT RESOURCES AND MAKE FURTHER CRIMINALIZE FORMALLY INCARCERATED OR CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. MYSTICS IN THE NATION ARE YOU CURRENTLY pWRAP IT UP PLEASE. THAT THEY THINK OUR I WAS IT UP I JUST WANTED TO ENOUGH AND THAT THE DISSEMINATION OF OUR RECORDS. THESE RECORDS ARE ALREADY ALL OVER THE PLACE WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO KEEP A HOLD OF THESE RECORDS. AND WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S WHICH IS ALSO LEAD TO OUR INFORMATION THE APARTMENT USE THAT METHOD BE. THEY YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB ONE FAN. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH EVERYONE ON THIS. IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISS DICKSON THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE HEARING IN- FOR YOUR- YOUR SUMMARY OF- OF WHY YOU'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL- ARE THERE ANY OTHER PERSONS ARE WISHING TO OPPOSE THIS BILL.

INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THIS WOULD ALSO BE PROTECTED BY THIS MEASURE ON AND SECONDLY AT MYSTICS AND RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT DATA INTEGRITY ACROSS OUR STATE AGENCIES AND I KNOW THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS A THE TERROR OF THE ASSEMBLY ACCUNTABILITY COMMITTEE AN AREA OF FOCUS FOR ME AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. ENSURE THAT WE ROUTE WE HAVE THAT WE RECTIFY ANY GAPS AND ISSUES BUT- I THINK POINTING TO EXISTING FAILURES IN STATE AGENCIES AS A RATIONALE FOR PILING ON EVEN MORE ABOUT POLICY DOES NOT SEEM LOGICAL ON SO I WOULD WOULD ALSO JUST AT ANYTHING CLOSE I KNEW ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEN HE'S PART OF THIS COMMITTEE IT INTRODUCED AT A SIMILAR MEASURE AND ON HIS NOW SIGNED ON AS A DOING AUTHOR THIS TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE.
