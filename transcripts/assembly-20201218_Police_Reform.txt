HEY DAN MY NAME IS ERIC NINE YEARS AND I AM THE PROUD I'M I'M ACTUALLY THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY OF LOS ALAMEDA STEINORTH COUNTY I WAS AT A PALM AND MOVED OVER FIVE YEARS AGO I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND REPRESENT ALL THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MINUTES VOTE PLEASE CHOOSE. A CALIFORNIA- I'VE ENJOYED THE CONVERSATION WE SHARED DURING THE EARLIER SELECT COMMITTEE. HEARING ON THE HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM- THOROUGHLY. AND AND I REALLY RESPECT THE WORK THAT THE PANEL IS DOING- THE COMMITTEE IS DOING AND I'M GLAD TO BE BACK AGAIN. SPEAKING WITH YOU AT THIS TIME. ON THE MATTER OF- PLEASE DISCIPLINE AND ACCOUNTBILITY- BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION AS MANY OF THE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES WE WILL BE DISCUSSING. THIS YEAR I WAS ASSOCIATION SUCH AS THESE CERTIFICATION ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE TOPICS. I CAN TELL YOU THE POLICE- AS POLICE CHIEFS IT IS OUR JOB. TO HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND THEIR CONTACT. WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR OFFICERS ENSURING THAT. THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE TRAINS AND MEET THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND SHARING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR. EVERY OUTCOME. ALL OF ALL OF THIS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF. THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO MUCH. DESERVED AND- ARE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OF A CHEAP AND ONE THAT WE TAKE SERIOUSLY. WELL TO THIS- IT SIGNIFICANCE THE CURRENT SCRUTINY REGARDING POLICE CONDUCT. IN THIS ROLE BECOMES EVEN MORE VITAL. PRIORITY HEARING PRIOR TO THIS HEARING I HAVE ASKED YEAH EACH OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS. OF THIS WEEK- TO PROVIDE ME WITH SOME FEEDBACK REGARDING. THESE MATTERS TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU- IN GENERAL THE COMMENTS AT AROUND TWO THINGS. FIRST THAT TEAMS DO IN FACT HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR INITIATING BY INITIATING ABOUT PERSONNEL DESTINATIONS WHEN A VIOLATION OF POLICY OR LAW HAS BEEN ALLEGED. AND THEY TAKE THE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES AFTER AND- INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN. COMPLETED AND SUSTAINED. SECOND THE PUBLIC RARELY SEES THESE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND THOSE OF THEM WHICH CREATES A SENSE OF SECRECY OR PERCEPTION OF PERHAPS INACTION. AND WE KNOW THIS. TO THE FIRST POINT POLICE CHIEFS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE. ANY OFFICER FOR MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATIONS DEPARTMENT POLICIES IN ADDITION. TO THE OFFICER POTENTIALLY FACING CRIMINAL PENALTIES. OR LEGAL LACKS IT IS IMPORTANT. FOR ME TO KNOW THAT SINCE THE SIGNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF OUR SPONSORED LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SENATE BILL ON TWO THIRTY BY SENATOR- CABALLERO. ANY I'M YOU CALL AUTHORED EVERY SINGLE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. NOW I THE USE FORCE BY THAT REQUIRES DE ESCALATION RENDERING MEDICAL AID. HE- DUTY TO INTERCEDE AND MORE ALL OF WHICH AN OFFICER CAN BE DISCIPLINED HI POTENTIALLY TERMINATED. FOR FAILING TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND- IN THIS NEW STATEWIDE STANDARD. THE PROCESS OF PERSISTENT COMPLAINTS OR VIOLATIONS DOES REQUIRE CONFRONTING THE ACCUSED WITH ALLEGATIONS- ALLOWANCES FOR REPRESENTATION APPEALS EXCHANGING INFORMATION REVIEW AND XCERRA A PROPOSAL OR UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WE ALL HOLD TO BE FAIR IN OUR COUNTRY. IS A FORM OF DUE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE FOR EVERYONE ACCUSED MISCONDUCT FOR CRIME. THEY'RE ALSO PROCESS IS THERE ESTABLISHED THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING YEAH THAT INSTITUTE THE METHOD OF RESOLVING CONFLICT AND DISPUTE. HAS DONE FOR MANY OTHER- PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. ULTIMATELY THESE SYSTEMS ENSURE BOTH SIDES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR CASE AND DECISIONS. ARE MADE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN FACT. WHEN THE DECISION ARE MADE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CONSEQUENCES MATCH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE. WHEN I BELIEVE COMES THE NEED FOR THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. OFFICERS WHO COMMIT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT WHICH WE WOULD ALL AGREE SHOULD DISQUALIFY HIM FROM HOLDING A POSITION IN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY REMOVED. FROM ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. THIS IS IN THE POSITION OF C. P. C. A. PRIOR TO INTRODUCTION OF ANY- DECERTIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN OUR ASSOCIATIONS PLATFORM ON POLICE REFORM IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY OF THAT AS WELL AS A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AS WE ROLL INTO IT. THAT'S JUST AND SHOULD USE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY. THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE TO INVESTIGATE IDENTIFYING TRACT- JUDICATA REMOVE THOSE BAD OFFICERS THAT STAY IN OUR PROFESSION AND HAVE LOST THE HONOR OF SERVING OUR PUBLIC TRUST. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS A SYSTEM THAT OFFICERS ARE INVESTIGATED FOR MINOR OFFENSES BY AGENCIES WITH NO REAL FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE INCIDENT WHERE VANCE. WE NEED THOSE WHO CONDUCTED THESE INVESTIGATIONS BE PROFESSIONALS. ARE WITH ENOUGH EXPERTISE TO DO A THOROUGH AND SOUND JOB WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THOSE MAKING THE DECISIONS TO. END SOMEONE'S CAREER. THAT THEY HAVE RELEVANT- EXPERIENCE UNDERSTAND LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICY AND RELEVANT LEGAL CASES AND CAN MAKE FAIR DECISIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATOR THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON LEGISLATION THIS. COMING YEAR IN THAT REGARD. ADDITIONALLY TO THE SECOND POINT MADE BY THE BOARD MEMBERS WE NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT REGARDING OUR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. CBCA WAS THE ONLY- FONG COARSENESS OF STATION TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BY SENATOR SKINNER WHICH TOOK A MAJOR STEP TOWARD ALLOWING THE RELEASE OF POLICE PERSONNEL FILES. AND ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATION HAD INITIALLY UPON IMPLEMENTATION. IT DID FINALLY ALLOW CHIEFS TO SHARE AND THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE GOOD WORK OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS DO YOU JUST SEARCH. OF THOSE ANSWERS- AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HOWEVER LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO BETTER- YOU WE KNOW THIS WEEK- ENSURE THAT DO BETTER. IN WHAT WE SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC IN BECOMING MORE TRANSPARENT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX. ALSO BY CENTERS SKINNER SUCH EXPAND- WHAT WE CAN RELEASE UNFORTUNATELY- WE COULDN'T FIND A COMPROMISE AND CIVIL PENALTIES- DEFINITELY THE RETENTION PERIODS THAT CONSIDER THE COST FOR THE- CITIES AND TOWNS- AGENCY IS ALREADY FACING MAJOR BUDGET DEFICITS. BUT WE HAVE ALREADY READING GATES IN THOSE- OBSERVATIONS WITH THE HOPES OF FINDING AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT. A SUCH A MEASURE AGAIN. WE ALSO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB FOR THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ITSELF. AND HOW THEY CAN STAY INFORMED AND THEN PARTICIPATE WITH THAT PROCESS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL FINDS OF FILES A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT COMPLAINT AND. HOW THE CASE WAS RESOLVED. HOW CAN WE EXPECT YOU KNOW OUR P. ARE HOW CAN EXPECT TO TRUST A PROCESS THAT THEY DON'T SEE. OR DON'T HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART OF AND HELPING TO MAKE MORE TRANSPARENT. HE'S OUR SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN AND WILL MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE. BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU PROVIDING FEEDBACK SPEAK WITH YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF KNOWN AS WE REALLY APPRECIATE. ARE YOU APPEARING A SECOND TIME- TO THIS- TO THIS HEARING PROVIDING- YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND REPRESENTING THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND. AND WE DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE VISUAL PART WE COULDN'T SEE WHAT WE CAN WE HEARD YOU. LOUD AND CLEAR- AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ADDRESS THAT AT SOME POINT TIME. WITH THAT BEING SAID IT WANT TO- GO OUT OF ORDER. FOR BRIEFLY ONE CALLED MR PAUL HENDERSON- MISTER HENDERSON IS WOULD SET THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT- ACCOUNTABILITY- AND SO WE APPRECIATE MISTER HENDERSON PLEASE COME ON UP. AND PLEASED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AGAIN REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. MISTER HENDERSON WHEN YOU SETTLE IN AND YOU HAVE A SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES- TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY IN PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF- AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR LENDING YOUR VOICE IN THIS PROCESS AND SHARING WITH US TODAY. WELL MISTER HENDERSON IS PREPARING HIMSELF ALONE ALSO- ALSO WANT TO- SHOULD FOLLOW MY NOTES I WANT TO CERTAINLY THANK OUR SPEAKER FOR ALLOWING US TO ONE HAVE SUCH A COMMITTEE AGAIN IS CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATES- SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON I'M COMMITMENT AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON POLICE REFORM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WANNA- CERTAINLY THANK OUR SPEAKER FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE THIS SPACE IN THIS TIME SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- MISTER ANDERSON YOU ARE UP TO BATCH. THANK YOU. HELLO OKAY WORKING THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO BE ADDRESSING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC- MY NAME IS PAUL HENDERSON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IN SAN FRANCISCO I'D JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND- I SPENT ALMOST TWO DECADES AS A PROSECUTOR AND ACTUALLY I WAS- CHIEF- OF ADMINISTRATION UNDER COMELEC HARRIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND THEN I WORKED WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND SO THE WORK THAT I DO NOW. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S- ONE OF THE LARGEST CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES HERE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DOES INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND SO I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT WORK AND I'M EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT WORK IS ON THE SET MY TIMER TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW YELL AT BANK- YES YOU WOULD NOT. IT'S NOT MY FIRST RODEO WHEN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE EVERYTHING SET. UP AND I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT- SOME OF THESE TOPICS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ADDRESSING OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS BUT REALLY ARE REFLECTIVE OF SOME OF THE BIGGER PROBLEMS ARE HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. AND WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH PUBLIC TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AS INTERPRETED BY THE COMMUNITIES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS DESIGNED TO SERVE AND SO. THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL COMING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SOLUTIONS IS A VERY BIG DEAL. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE. RIGHT NOW- BEYOND JUST A MOMENT IN TIME AN ENTIRE MOVEMENT ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE SEE SO MUCH CIVIL UNREST ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES DIRECTLY. I WILL SAY- I'M HOPEFUL THAT SOLUTIONS ARE IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME GUIDELINES ALREADY THAT EXIST- ONE OF THE BIGGEST I THINK THAT EXIST IS. THAT THE ISSUED. THEY ISSUED RULES FROM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING THAT WE'VE HAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT CAME OUT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM- WITH THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CENTURY POLICING IS THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE ENCOURAGED AND NOT MANDATORY. AND THEY ARE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND THAT GOES BEYOND JUST LOCAL IT GOES TO STATE AS WELL AND CERTAINLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE HAD SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE POLICIES SHOULD BE MANDATED AND ENFORCED- TO HAVE HIGHER ACCOUNTABILITY SPECIFICALLY. FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND LIKE I SAID I YOU KNOW SOMETIMES. PEOPLE CHALLENGE ME ON MY OPINIONS AND THAT'S FINE BUT YOU DON'T GET TO CHALLENGE ME ON FACTS AND YOU DON'T GET THE CHALLENGE ON STATISTICS THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR ABSOLUTE. THAT CONFIRM REYES DISPARITIES AND POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THESE ARE JUST FACTS- AND I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS GENERALLY BECAUSE- IT'S HARD WHEN FOLKS AREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE AND ARE CHALLENGED WITH OUT A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THAT RACE DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY EXISTING AND MOST IF NOT ALL JURISDICTIONS. AND TO THE DEGREE THAT'S AN ISSUE I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THEIR USE OF FOR STATISTICS AND OVERLAY THEM WITH RACE ANALYSIS AND YOU'LL SEE- AND HAVE IT CONFIRMED. THAT OVER 19% OF USE OF FORCE RECORDS ARE HIGHER FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE AGAIN THESE ARE JUST FACTS- AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN SPECIFICALLY ARE TWENTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE. KILLED WITH INTERACTIONS. WITH LAW COURSE AGAIN FEES ARE JUST FACTS BUT THEY GIVE US THE GROUNDWORK AND A FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DISPARITIES AND NOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO SOLVENTS AT TO SOLVE THEM. HOW DO WE REBUILD PUBLIC TRUST AND HOW DO WE HAVE ACTUAL POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. AGAIN WE ALREADY KNOW NOT ALL COPS ARE BAD BUT THE INSTITUTION OF POLICING HAS TO CHANGE TO BE RACE NEUTRAL. WE ARE PAYING OUR TAX DOLLARS WE ARE ENTITLED TO PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL COMMUNITIES THAT IS RACE NEUTRAL AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE. RACE DISPARITIES- THE BEST PRACTICES AS DEFINED BY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING OUR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY EVALUATING LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES WE'VE GOT OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THIS COUNTRY. AND JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AND I AM THE HEAD OF ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT MEANS THAT MY INFORMATION IS EVIDENCE BASED IT IS BASED ON THE TRANSGRESSIONS AND THE COMPLAINTS THAT COME INTO MY OFFICE THAT I SEE. BEYOND JUST WHAT MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN GROWING UP IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE- AS WELL. SO KNOWING THAT INFORMATION I WOULD SAY. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH- AS A PRIORITY IS ADDRESSING PUBLIC TRUST AND WHY IT'S BROKEN AND WHAT SOME OF THOSE SOLUTIONS ARE AND I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT OR SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. WE SHOULD START WITH OUR WE COULD START WITH ARE MAKING SURE THAT POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT JUST INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES. THAT HAS NOT PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT PROVEN TO SPEAK TO THE LACK OF PUBLIC TRUST ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESSES ARE THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AS LEADERS AND AS LEGISLATORS. TO MAKE SURE THAT SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. ARE SIMILAR FOR THE PUBLIC AS THEY ARE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT ACCOUNTABLE IN THE SAME WAYS. AND SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK WE CAN START DEALING WITH IS THAT SINGULAR ISSUE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. WHERE INDEPENDENT JURISDICTIONS ARE FORCED TO RELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES THAT IS NOT PROVEN RELIABLE NOR HAS IT PROVEN. NOR HAS IT BEEN PROVEN TO BE A TOOL THAT COMMUNITIES ARE COMFORTABLE RELYING ON- AND I WOULD TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER THAT JUSTICE INDEPENDENTLY SHOULD NOT REST ENTIRELY ON THOSE LOCAL PROSECUTORS TO EVALUATE EVIDENCE OR INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT THEY WORK WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS. THERE SHOULD BE STANDARDS WHERE DOES INTERACTION SPECIFICALLY WHEN THEY INVOLVED LETHAL FORCE WERE OUTSIDE AGENCIES ARE EVALUATING WHAT THOSE INCIDENTS ARE THAT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC CAN RELY UPON AND TRUST AS OBJECTIVE. OBJECTIVE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S GOING ON I MEAN THIS ALL SPEAKS OF THINGS I'M GOING TO CLOSE OUT WITH IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND DATA BUT THAT'S THE FOUNDATION OF IT I THINK WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS NOW. AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT JUST- MOMENT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS IS AN ENTIRE NEW MOVEMENT AND WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING RACE DISPARITIES IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR DECADES NOW BUT NOW I THINK WE'RE AT A TIME WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE INFORMED AND HAVE SPECIFIC DEMANDS. ON WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEM WHAT OUR EADERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING SOLUTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN RELY ON YOU CANNOT HAVE PUBLIC TRUST WITH INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED. WHICH GETS ME TO THE DATA POINT THAT THE PART THAT THINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING IN TERMS OF DATA WHERE THE DATA SHARING IS ENCOURAGED THAT NEEDS TO BE MANDATED WE SHOULD HAVE RULES DEFINING DATA COLLECTION. DATA TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THE DATA AND ANALYSIS IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO JUST COLLECT THE DATA AND ISSUE TEN THOUSAND PAGES OF CHARTS AND GRAPHS AND NUMBERS WITHOUT INFORMATION AND SOME OF THAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE. DEFINED WITH RACE THAT INFORMATION IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO SOLVE THINGS BECAUSE WE CAN'T FX WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT AND WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND IF WE'RE NOT COLLECTING THE DATA TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT AND SHARING IT WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITIES. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS AND WE'RE NOT SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC TRUST THAT WE HAVE TO CULTIVATE. AND THAT WE HAVE TO DEVELOP. I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL ALREADY IN THIS STATE LIKE THE NINETY SIX A. REPORTS IN THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE REPORT. THEY'RE STILL BEST PRACTICES THAT NEED TO BE SHARED IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT IT'S A CATCH AS CATCH CAN BUY JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION WHO'S DOING IT WELL. AND WHO HAS RELIABLE INFORMATION THAT'S BOTH SHARED. MAY TRANSPARENT AND ANALYZED THERE SHOULD BE STANDARDS THAT WHERE EVER YOU GO SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATE. BUT THAT'S TAKING PLACE BECAUSE IF WE BUILD IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER STATES WILL FOLLOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE ALL COMMUNITIES ARE DEMANDING THAT ESPECIALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE RACE DESPERATE OUTCOMES THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR WITH THEIR TAX DOLLARS. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY IS SIGNED AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THOSE SOLUTIONS. MEASURES ANDERSON ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS ALL OKAY. THE OTHER TWO IMPORTANT THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR POLICIES POLICIES HAVE TO BE EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES. DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT SO THEY'RE NOT BE A RADICAL SOLUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE DEFINED BY THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED. AND THEN THE LAST THING THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS MAKING SURE THAT ONCE WE'VE COME UP WITH THOSE- POLICY SUGGESTIONS THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TIED TO TRAINING WE HAVE TO REFORM AND ADDRESS TRADING WE HAVE TO REFORM AND ADDRESS BIAS AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. I BELIEVE IS BY HAVING. NEW AND BROADER MEASURES OF INDEPENDENCE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CYCLES TO EVALUATE AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS MANDATES AND POLICIES FOR THOSE SAME AGENCIES TO MAKE THEM MORE COUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TEST YOUR TESTIMONY WE REALLY APPRECIATE- WE'LL JUST ASK IF YOU CAN JUST. SIT TIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE. BECAUSE THAT WILL HAVE MEMBERS WHO ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY COME BACK UP AND POSSIBLY INCORPORATE WHICH YOU DIDN'T FINISH THE HOBBIT INTO- YOUR REBUTTAL OR REMARKS THAT- RESPONSE FROM OUR MEMBERS OF THANK YOU. VERY VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF ORDER ONCE AGAIN WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR- OUR DEAN OF OUR LAW SCHOOL UC BERKELEY TO JOIN US TO BE JOINING US. IS BEING DELAYED A LITTLE BIT SO NEXT UP WE WANT TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANELIST RETIRED LIEUTENANT- THE- GHOST. SHE'S A CURRENT BOARD CHAIR- IT INCOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE LOSS AT THE LOCALLAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION PARTNERSHIP SO SHE WILL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY ARE YOU WITH US. MS GHOSTING I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF THIS ESTEEMED PANEL. I AND MY COLLEAGUES- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT MYSELF HAVING SPENT MY CAREER AS A POLICE OFFICER IN REDONDO BEACH CALIFORNIA AND AS THE CHILDREN NOTED THE CURRENT BOARD CHAIR AND INCOMING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION PARTNERSHIP. ALSO KNOWN AS LEAP LEAP IS A NONPROFIT GROUP A PULL BASED PROSECUTORS JUDGES AND OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS WHO SPEAK FROM MISSION IS TO MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER BY FOCUSING LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ON THE GREATEST THREATS TO. PUBLIC SAFETY PROMOTING ALTERNATIVES TO ARREST NEW CAR SERRATION ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME. AND BRIDGING THE GAP AND KILLING A POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS STATE THAT POLICING NEEDS MAJOR CHANGES AND THEY SUPPORT WIDESPREAD REFORMS. WHICH INCLUDE CHANGING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO OFFICER ABUSES ARE PUNISHED. BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALSO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WHAT THE DEMAND IS PROFESSIONAL AND GOOD POLICING. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER WAS TO LOOK AT THIS VERY COMPLEX AND LAYERED CONVERSATION AND TO SEE YOU KNOW. ARE THERE HURDLES ENOUGH HOLDING OFF SERVICE RIGHTS WHILE SEEKING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISCONDUCT AND- WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IT IS I FULLY SUPPORT AND UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR ENSURING THAT POLICE OFFICER PROCEDURAL RIGHTS ARE UPHELD. AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED PEACE PROCESS SAYS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO TALK IN DEPTH ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AND THE APPEALS PROCESS BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE THAT SPEAKS TO THE INTERSECTION OF HOW POLICE MEMORANDUMS THE POLICE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS. AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS CAN'T CONTRIBUTE BOTH TO THE PERCEPTION THAT OFFICERS ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CREATE BARRIERS FOR OFFICERS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO FOR A FUTURE DISCUSSION A TOPIC I THINK THAT THERE ARE PLACES THAT WE CAN. POTENTIALLY AGREED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TWEAKING OF THESE SYSTEMS. BUT THE LARGER QUESTION IS HOW WE IMPROVE A SYSTEM OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT PROCESS AND POLICIES CAN HELP US BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE. IN THIS DISCIPLINE PROCESS. SO. BUT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SPEAK TO IS AS WE LOOK AT THIS DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS LICENSE IN A REPLICATION PROCESS THAT THERE ARE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THEIR ARBITRATION PROCESS IN SO FOURTEEN AS AN EXAMPLE BARS AN ARBITRATOR FROM OVERRULING OR MODIFYING PUNISHMENT HANDED DOWN AGAINST AN OFFICER UNLESS ARBITRATOR FINDS THE PUNISHMENT TO BE ARBITRARY CAPRICIOUS DISCRIMINATORY OR OTHERWISE. UNREASONABLE AND IT'S THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE THAT PROTECTS BOTH THE OFFICER AND THE COMMUNITY BUT WHAT IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING CALIFORNIA'S ALSO LACK OF THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. POLICE DECERTIFICATION IS AN INTUITIVE AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE ESCALATING POLICE COMMUNITY RELATION CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY. PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER NOTED WERE PREDICTABLE RESPONSE HER ABJECT FAILURE TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS WITHIN THE PROFESSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE THE LAST PROCESS IN THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONALISM ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT INCLUDES THE ENGAGEMENT. OF ALL COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. SYSTEMIC APPROACHES TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND PREVENT MISCONDUCT MUST INCLUDE CLEAR POLICIES TRAINING AFFECTED SUPERVISION CIVILIAN REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT ROBUST EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS NATIONAL STATE LEVEL PROCEDURAL JUSTICE STANDARDS. AN INDEPENDENT SENTINEL EVENT REVIEW SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO REVIEW FATAL SHOOTINGS AND ERRORS OF JUSTICE IN THE EVENT OF MISTAKES. D. CERTIFICATES THOUGH WILL ALSO REQUIRES TO SUPPORT OF FEDERAL RESPONSE TO CREATE A BETTER FUNDED AND MORE ROBUST NATIONAL DECERTIFICATION INDEX AS NOTED BY THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WE NEED A NATIONAL REGISTER OF DECERTIFIED OFFICERS THAT AGGREGATES UP TO DATE DATA. OF THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LICENSES ARE BEEN DISSED THE CERTIFIED PREVENTING THEM FROM BEING HIRED ANOTHER JURISDICTIONS. BUT CLEARLY THE QUESTION FOR DECERTIFICATION FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR THE- FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION IS HOW DO WE DESIGN THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA. INVESTORS FOR BASIC QUESTIONS WHAT RESPECT YOU PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF. AS I STATED BEFORE NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT OUR COMMUNITY VOICES AS WELL. AND BY CLEARLY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS YOU CAN HELP REMOVE OBSTACLES TO SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST DECERTIFICATION PROCESS AND SUPPORT POLICE LEGITIMACY THAT HELPS RESTORE COMMUNITY TRUST. AND THE FOUR QUESTIONS THAT I BELIEVE ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OUR WHICH CRIMINAL JUSTICE OFFICERS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO DECERTIFICATION. WHO WHO ELSE DOES IMPACT YOU CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS POLICE OFFICERS COMMUNITY SERVICE OPS SERVERS- DOES IT IMPACT PRIVATE SECURITY. WHAT KINDS OF MISCONDUCT SHOULD RESULT IN DECERTIFICATION WHAT MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION BY EVERY DEPARTMENT IN THE CERTIFICATION. AND AS WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN OTHER MODELS. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE PERSISTENT LACK OF COMPLIANCE TO REPORT AND INVESTIGATE MISCONDUCT BY AGENCIES AND RECORDING TWO COMMISSIONS THAT DECERTIFYING REVOKE LICENSING. I'M I KNOW I. PROBABLY COULD SPEAK MORE BUT I'D LIKE TO ALSO STATE SOME TIME FOR QUESTIONS SO- I WANT TO THANK OUR BOPPARD I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERTISE AND I LOOK FORWARD FOR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE COMMUNITY AND WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO FIND A PROCESS. THAT IS FAIR AND BALANCED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE SENATE GHOSTING WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND PLEASE IF YOU CAN JUST- STICK AROUND WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- FOR YOU- FROM OUR MEMBERS AND WITH THAT BEING SAID WE WANT TO GO INTO- WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR MR. ASSUME RISKY TO JOIN US- WITHOUT NO FURTHER DO WILL GO RIGHT INTO OUR QUEUE IN A- PORTION SO MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY OR VIRTUALLY IF YOU CAN PLEASE TEXT ME IF IN FACT YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE WANT TO- TAKE. YOUR QUESTIONS- AND I'LL START WITH ANY MEMBERS OF THE PANEL FIRST- BEFORE WE DO THAT WE HAVE- MISTER MCCARTY WHOSE JOIN AS YOU SAY LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND THEY WILL GO TO MISTER CHAD MAYES- LAST. YOU WERE TO ASK A QUESTION GREAT FANTASTIC- WELL YOU WANT US OF COURSE YOU KNOW. EAST YEAH CERTAINLY MISTER CHAT THANKS FOR HAVING US AGAIN TODAY AND I THINK THAT LEGISLATION THAT WE PUT FORWARD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONLY BE BETTER. BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO DIG IN HERE AND THIS OF COURSE WAS SOME OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS FROM TWENTY. TWENTY AS WE KNOW IT'S OUT OF THE GATE IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED AS A TOP PRIORITY OF BOTH OUR SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY ANTHONY RENDON. AS WELL AS THE PRO TEN WHO'S A JOINT AUTHOR ON I THINK IT'S ASSEMBLY BILL ONE OR 2% OF BILL ONE OR TWO. COMING OUT ON THIS TOPIC SO I WANTED TO ENGAGE AND I DID HERE- THE MINISTER MARVEL PORAC AND- THE CHIEF MISTER NUNEZ- WHO'S THE PRESIDENT SHE'S ASSOCIATION I HEARD THEM- HEARD THE PRESENTATION EVEN I WASN'T HERE- AND I WANTED TO. ASK THEM. THAT KIND OF TO. AND ACT I KNOW WE'RE NOT. VOTING ON THE BILL BUT BUT IN GENERAL- WHAT HAVE BEEN THE IMPEDIMENTS OF PUTTING FORWARD A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS ALL THESE YEARS I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW- WE HAVE A COUNTER PROPOSAL FROM LINE FOR SPIN WE HAVE A MORE. AGGRESSIVE PROPOSAL FOR MISTER BRADFORD THEIR OPINION WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE ANYTHING TO DATE IF IT IS INADEQUATE AND DO THEY THINK THE SECOND QUESTION DO THEY THINK THAT THERE. ARE OFFICERS THAT SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY- EMPLOYED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT- BECAUSE THEY THEY RESIGN BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION IS FINALIZED. MAYBE THERE ISN'T A CRIMINAL ACTION BUT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR PEOPLE TO- SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS AND- CONTINUE WITH OTHER THAT DEPARTMENT OR NEW JASON DEPARTMENT SO. THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHIEF NUNEZ WAS IT. NEW YES AND MARBLE. MISTER MOORE OFFICER MARVEL. I MISS NEW YEAR'S PLEASE ON MUTE YOURSELF AND YOU CAN PROCEED WITH. SURE THIS IS A G. IN HIS ARMS. YEAH OF THAT REALLY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ARE YOU WAS ASKING THAT QUESTION I THINK THERE ARE NO DOUBT THERE ARE OFFICERS THAT I HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS AND I THINK FOR THE VERY REASON THAT HE- INDICATED WHICH WAS THAT- WELL ONE OF THE REASONS. IS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- POSTED HAVE- YOU KNOW RESIGNED- BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF A AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION BUT WE CAUGHT OUR FIRST NOW THAT'S THE ASIAN. AND AS A RESULT- THEY AREN'T- DISCIPLINE BY THAT AGENCY THAT WAS- THERE AT WORK FOR PREVIOUSLY- AND SO THE TRACKING OF THAT INFORMATION THEY DO- BACKGROUNDS ON OFFICERS TO GO TO THOSE POLICE DEPARTMENTS BUT- WHEN THEY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME THERE WAS NO OUTCOME RIGHT BECAUSE- THE INVESTIGATION WASN'T COMPLETED- AND- BECAUSE THEY HAD LEFT- PREVIOUS TO IT HAPPENED I'M COMING TO COMPLETION SO. I THINK- THOSE INSTANCES OF THAT THOUGH NOT- NUMEROUS THEY ARE THEY ARE THERE AND THAT'S REALITY AND- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO- TO FIX OUR WAS- WITH THAT THE CERTIFICATION LANGUAGE. AND GETTING THAT FIXED NOW TO THE VERY FIRST PART OF THAT WERE. WHY HAVE WE DONE THIS SOONER I REALLY CAN'T ANSWER TO THAT OTHER THAN I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT TELL CHEESE FOR A WHILE- THE END- IN. WE INITIALLY. WERE- INDOORS THE OR SUPPORTIVE OF- OF THE FIRST BILL THAT CAME OUT WITH BRAD ONE RAPPER CAME. OUT WITH THE BILLS AND BRADFORD AND WE- IT WAS THOUGH THERE WAS SOME LANGUAGE ISSUES THAT WE- I PROBLEMS WITHIN SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT- THE WEEK- THAT MADE IT SO THAT WE COULD NOTE- COULDN'T SUPPORT IT. BUT WE DO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT WE DO SUPPORT- MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT- AND HAVING AND HAVE I THINK OUR WHO WAS- PRESENT MARBLE THAT IT'S STATED- THAT- HAVING POSED TO THE SINCE THEY DO THE CERTIFICATION. OF OFFICERS BE THE BODY THAT D. CERTIFIES THEM. AND THAT WAS A AN IMPORTANT ASPECT. OF THAT FOR US- CHEAP NEW YEAR'S WHAT I HAVE FOLLOW FOR YOU SO. DID I HEAR CORRECTLY WHEN YOU SAID THAT- THE INVESTIGATION STOPS IF AN OFFICER- RESIGN. AND YOU DON'T GO FOR TO CONCLUDE WHETHER NOT THAT PERSON WAS ACTUALLY- COMMITTED TO WHATEVER THAT PERSON WAS ALLEGED TO COMMIT SO THAT JUST STOPS IT IS NOT A WAY FOR AN OFFICER TO. IT TOO- GO TO ANOTHER POLICE DEPARTMENT SAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PROSECUTOR OR FOUND GUILTY OR WHATEVER ALLEGATIONS MAYBE. AS CHAIR THERE ARE SOME INVESTIGATIONS WERE SOME AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE. AND DO THAT BUT FOR IF IN PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION IS INTERVIEWING THAT OFFICER GETTING THEIR TESTIMONY. AND GETTING THAT AS PART OF THE EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT IT'S HARD TO COME TO THE- CONCLUSION- YOU KNOW HOW WITH THAT INVESTIGATION. AND AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS- REFERENCING. SO THEY CAN PICK IT IS ACTUALLY YOU HAVE AN INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT. OKAY SO ANYONE COULD USE THAT METHOD TO- TO EVADE OR TO AVOID BEING OF FIRED A BLEMISH ON A PERSON'S RECORD- AND SO DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IN YOUR OPINION. HE NO I DO NOT THINK IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND THEN THE LATE AS I SAID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW BAD APPLES IN MOST POLICE OFFICERS ARE GONNA WANT THAT DUE PROCESS. AND BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND END UP FIGHTING FOR THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR THEIR GOOD NAME AND- AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE A PROPERTY RIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT- ITS THE- THOSE FEW BAD APPLES WITHIN OUR PROFESSION. THAT ARE GONNA PROBABLY OPT FOR THAT- A RESIGNATION AND THEN HOPE TO ESCAPE THE COMPLETION OF THAT INVESTIGATION- SO YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT- YOU KNOW COME BE ABLE TO COMPLETE. SOMEHOW COMPLETE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS OR AT LEAST THAT'S PART OF THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT GOES ON RECORD WITH- POSTED THESE. FOLKS HAVE BEEN LEAVING. IN LIEU OF- RESIDENT NOW RESIDING IN LIEU OF GERMANTOWN TERMINATION OR DISCIPLINE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISS MCCARTY- YOU COMPLETE YEAH I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT MISTER HENDERSON A POLICE JUMPED UP HERE SO THOUGHT HE WANTED TO. ENGAGE IN THIS PLEASE DO SO PLEASE. CATCHER MICROPHONE ON MISSING YOU REMEMBER THAT THEY DID TO ISSUES. I DO I WAS JUST GOING TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH THE- LACK OF DISCIPLINE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUE OF THE OFFICERS LEAVING. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS AND THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS SPEAKING WESTERN UNION WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE DIFFERENT. LANES OF ACCOUNTABILITY I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE. SO SAFE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A TRANSGRESSION INVOLVING- LETHAL INCIDENT- AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THERE ALL THESE INDEPENDENT TRACKS THAT COME OUT TO DO AN EVALUATION. SO INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT- THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IS LOOKING AN EVALUATION- AND IF THERE IS AN OUTSIDE LIKE CIVILIAN AGENCY THAT'S A DIRT TRACK AND THOSE ARE THE PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT SPEAK TO THE OFFICERS RIGHT TO HAVE HIS EMPLOYMENT AND THE JOB. AND ONE OF THE THINGS SO WHEN HE HE SAID THAT- DISCIPLINE CAN CONTINUE. THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S AGENCY CAN CONTINUE BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE BLOCKED OFF ARE FREE. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION AND THE OUTSIDE AND WERE CIVILIAN AGENCY THAT COULD HAVE. DISCIPLINE ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS SEPARATE FROM THE CERTIFICATION ISSUE THAT JURISDICTION CAN BE EXPANDED TO THOSE AGENCIES. TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION TO CONTINUE THEIR PROCESS FOR DISCIPLINE. INDEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE MEMBERS ARE RETIRED LEAVE QUIT. REMOVED MOVE AWAY OR DO WHATEVER SO THAT THOSE FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT AND THOSE FINDINGS FROM THOSE INVESTIGATIONS CAN BE USED. EVEN IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE USED FOR THOSE OFFICERS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE OR FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY THEY QUIT OR THEY RESIGNED. THE INFORMATION IS OFTENTIMES EVEN MORRELL AND THOSE INVEST. GET CONCLUDE AND THAT THOSE FINDINGS DO GET A FIRM SUSTAINED OR REVEALED SO THAT WE CAN USE THOSE DATA POINTS TO IMPROVE POLICING. SO THE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION AND OFTEN TIMES IT'S THOSE VERY INCIDENTS WHERE WE NEED THAT DATA THE MOST. WE NEED THOSE FINDINGS THE MOST AND I KEEP REFERRING TO THESE AS- CONCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION TO THE POINT OF HAVING FINDINGS BECAUSE THE FINDINGS ARE MOST OFTEN WHAT GETS REVEALED. THE FINDINGS ARE WHAT CAN BECOME TRANSPARENT AND THE FINDINGS ARE WHAT WE CAN USE TO CONFLATE OUR DATA TO EVALUATE TRENDS AND TO IMPROVE POLICING AND TO ADDRESS THE TRANSGRESSIONS THAT APPLY THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP. AND ALLOWS A LOT I'M MEAN THE LECTURE EVERYBODY BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THE POLICING STUFF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S PRETTY ESOTERIC WILL MISTER HENDERSON MAYBE I CAN NOW YES TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THERE IS A COUNTER PROPOSALS TODAY LAST YEAR. THE HOT AND HEAVY ON THIS TOPIC. WHY HASN'T LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM. PURSUE THIS AND PUSH THIS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT. SOME BAD APPLES MAKE MISTER LACKING AND COLLEAGUES LOOK BAD THE CHP NEVER HURTS. EVERYBODY YOU MEANT THAT PEOPLE SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS WERE SAYING THEY DO NOW SO WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A PUSH TO DO SO. AND DO YOU THINK THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE PLENTY OF. INDIVIDUALS IN THE EXAMPLES WHO. RESIGNED BEFORE AND I A INVESTIGATION IS A JUDICATA PERSONAL MATTERS TAKEN CARE OF. AND THEN GO ON TO WORK IN. THE EXAMPLES LIKE MAKE CITY MCFARLAND LIKE MR SALAS. THE SANGER OF ELSEWHERE AROUND THE STATE. OKAY SO. I GOT IT SO IT'S FOR ME TO- TO GAUGE WHY- THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL- POLICE REPRESENTATIVES HAVE NOT- EMBRACE THIS OR HAVE NOT- PUSHED IT FORWARD ARE COME UP WITH THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS INDEPENDENTLY. I JUST KNOW THAT YOU'RE TO FOR IT HAS NOT HAPPENED BUT TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT. THIS IS A REAL THING AND DOESN'T EXIST. THAT'S AN IRREFUTABLE YES ACT I MEAN THERE ARE RECORDS OF THAT EVEN FROM MY OWN AGENCY WITH A VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN STALLED DECLINED OR- MARGINALIZED BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LEFT THE DEPARTMENT- IN THE MIDDLE OF INVESTIGATIONS OR BEFORE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED. AND JUST IN REFERENCE TO THE BANK AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT WELL IT'S ONE OR TWO BAD APPLES HAVE YOU EVER HAD A BAD APPLE. YOU HAVE A BAD APPLE NINE. ONE BAD APPLE AND AFTER YOU'VE HAD THAT ONE BAD APPLE EVERY TIME SOMEONE BRINGS YOU AN APPLE OR AN APPLE COMES UP. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT. IS I HAD THAT BAD APPLE AND THE IMPACT THAT THESE TRANSGRESSIONS HAVE ON THE DEPARTMENT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE IMPACT THAT THESE BAD APPLES OR BAD TRANSGRESSIONS HAVE ON A COMMUNITY. IS WHAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND I WILL SAY WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND THE BAD APPLES TO SEE. DO WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE BAD APPLES CREATION. AND THE SUSTAINING OF THOSE BAD APPLES THROUGH BAD POLICIES. AND I'D I'D I DON'T MEAN INTENTIONALLY BAD POLICIES I MEAN POLICIES THAT WE'VE CREATED THAT HAVE AGGREGATE IMPACTS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES. THAT HERETOFORE HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED BY OUR PROCESSES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE DATA WE'RE NOT ANALYZING THE DATA WE'RE NOT. PAYING ATTENTION TO THE COMPLAINTS WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BAD APPLES AS IN THE DATA PERSPECTIVE AND ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE CAN WE MAKE POLICING BETTER. BY FOLLOWING THESE COMPLAINTS AND CREATING RULES THAT ARE MANDATORY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE BETTER ABLE TO SERVE IN A RACE NEUTRAL AWAY ALL COMMUNITIES THAT TO ME THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE. CAN CAN WE ARE- I THINK IT'S A GREAT DISCUSSION I WANT TO GO TO. A LAW PROFESSOR MISTER OF- IRWIN JIM RISKY WHOSE HAS JOINED US A LITTLE THE DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL- WOULD YOU PLEASE- MISTER SUMMERS GIVE YOU THEIR. YEAH I DID I DID MR SCHIRMER IS SCARY THERE. OKAY SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER ANDERSON- MISTER- MCCARTY WAS YOU COMPLETE YEAH OKAY VERY GOOD HOW DO WE BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS I'M CONCERNED HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THE TRUST I'VE BEEN HEARING IT REPEATEDLY AND A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS HERE TODAY AND ALSO- THIS WEEK TRUST TRUST TRUST HOW DO WE TRUST US WELL DO NOT GO THERE HOW DO WE TRUST SOMEONE WHO HAVE WHO HAVE- WHOSE TRUST HAVE BEEN- DISTORTED- WHO HAS- BROKEN ONES TRUST AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVING TO GRAPPLE WITH RIGHT NOW HOW DO WE RESTORE. THE TRUST BETWEEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT THOSE WHO SERVE AND PROTECT US AND THE COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY HAVING- I DON'T THINK IN LOOKING COMPLETELY TRUST ANYONE BUT HAVE THAT TRUST- BEING RESTORED- BACK IN OURS- IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE YOUR OATH OF OFFICE TO- TO SEEK TO SERVE AND PROTECT HOT WHAT IN YOUR OPINION BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO AS EXACT DIRECTOR FOR SAN FRANCISCO- HOW DO YOU LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND OUR SUGGESTIONS YOU CAN GIVE THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN- BRING BACK TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA. WELL I THINK WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO HAVE POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THAT TRANSGRESSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THAT ARE KNOWN- AND THESE TYPES OF TRANSGRESSIONS ARE KNOWN IN EVERY COMMUNITY THAT YOU GO AND WHERE THEY SAY LIKE OH THEY'RE THESE INCIDENTS ARE- THERE THESE EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD AND I MYSELF HAVE HAD SOME REALLY BAD EXPERIENCES THOSE ARE REAL AND THEY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY THE ONES THAT DEAL WITH AND ENCOMPASS RACE WE CAN'T BE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT RACE AS IT RELATES TO POLICING AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TOPIC AND IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE TOPIC BUT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE. TOPIC IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK THE PUBLIC TRY YOU HAVE TO ABOUT WHERE. YOU MUST ADDRESS THE RACE DISPARITIES AND YOU MUST MAKE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS RACE DISPARITIES IN POLICING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S THAT'S STEP ONE THE SECONDARY STEP IS BEYOND JUST THE DISCUSSION THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAS TO BE BOTH KNOWN AND MEASURED. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THE SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN'T SEE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRUST A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T HAVE RESULTS. WHERE THERE ARE LOOPHOLES OR WHERE THERE IS DISCRETIONARY- ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CHANGES FROM. BLOCK TO BLOCK CITY TO CITY COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND SO TO THE DEGREE WE HAVE BROAD- BROAD MEASURES IN PLACE AND ONE CITY OR ONE COUNTY. IT'S AN UNFAIR EVALUATION TO HAVE THOSE SAME TRANSGRESSIONS TAKE PLACE IN THE CITY RIGHT NEXT DOOR. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME SYSTEM I THINK INSTITUTIONALIZE. THE SOLUTION IN A WAY. BY WORKING WITH A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES DEVELOPING SO CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES BY HAVING STRONGER LEGISLATION THAT IS INFORMED BY THE DATA. INFORMED BY COMPLAINTS AND INFORMED BY SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF TRANSGRESSIONS THAT'S THE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD AND THOSE ARE SOLUTIONS. THAT YOU CAN BUILD OUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL IF THAT WORK ISN'T BEING DONE ARE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. BUT THAT'S ALSO WORK THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN BE TAKEN AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HOPE WE HAVE IN THIS CONVERSATION SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE SOLUTIONS CAN LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ANDERSON I WANT TO GO TO OUR A DEAN OF OUR LAW SCHOOL. AT BERKELEY- INSURE MORESCHI THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH SIR FOR BEING A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A FEW MOMENTS IN ADDITION SELVES AND GO RIGHT INTO YOUR PRESENTATION WE'VE ALREADY STARTED WE HAVE SOME TIME. AND WE HAVE MEMBERS WHO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- TO CONTINUE SO PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD SIR. OKAY SO MUCH I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU MY NAME IS OR WHEN CHEN RENTS CAN I AM THE DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. IN THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE THE COMMUNITY AS A GREAT INTEREST TO ME. IN TWO THOUSAND I WAS ASKED BY THE POLICE PROTECTIVELY. ONE WITH THE SOLE RIGHTS LAWYERS TO STUDY OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT IN LIGHT OF THE RAMPART SCANDAL. IS A LAWYER I'VE HANDLED MANY APPEALS GUARD TO PLACE EXCESSIVE FORCE CASES. AND I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME NOW IN A BOOK THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT THIS SUMMER THE FOCUS ON THE. SUPREME COURT RACE IN POLICING. THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOW. BROUGHT PUBLIC ATTENTION THE LONG STANDING ENORMOUS PROBLEMS. OF EXCESSIVE FORCE IN RACE AND POLICING. AS PRESIDENT BAACK OBAMA SAID A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH FINDS THE FOR SIMILAR OFFENSES MEMBERS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. I'M MORE LIKELY STOPPED SEARCHED ARRESTED VICTIMS SENTENCES HARSHER PENALTIES. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS BLACK MALES AGED FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR ARE NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN OTHER AMERICANS TO BE KILLED BY THE POLICE. BLACK AMERICANS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY OVERALL BECAUSE BY THE PLEASE. BUT ALL OTHERS IN SOCIETY SPANDEX ARE TWICE AS LIKELY KILLED BY POLICE THAN WHITE INDIVIDUALS. THE UNITED STATES CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION FOUND THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR 438% OF THE POPULATION. BUT 63% OF THOSE KILLED BY POLICE. WHAT I WANT TO TALK WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THIS MORNING IS WHITE WHICH HASN'T BEEN SOLVED. AND I THINK IT'S BEEN FOUNDER FEDERAL OR STATE LAW PROVIDES SUFFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE POLICE. THIS IS MY EXPERTISE LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW WHAT I'D URGE YOU TO CONSIDER HIS REFORMS OF STATE LAW TO ENHANCE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE PRIMARY FEDERAL STATUTE I'M SURE THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THIS FORTY TWO UNITED STATES CODE SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. THE LAWS IN ACTION AGAINST ANY STATE OR LOCAL OFFICER. OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT VIOLATES CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS THE UNITED STATES. BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS LIABLE WHEN THEY USE EXCESSIVE FORCE. EVEN DEADLY FORCE AND VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BILL LIABLE ONLY IF THEIR POLICIES AND CUSTOMS VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. THIS COURT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT THIS WILL POLICY CUSTOM. THE COURT IS SAID THAT A SINGLE INCIDENT CAN NEVER PROVE A POLICY. WHAT IS ALSO SAD THERE'S A STRICTCAUSATION REQUIREMENT IN THE POLICY IN THE INJURIES IN ORDER FOR THE RECOVERY. I BELIEVE I COULD CHANGE ANY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE LAW THE INCREASE THE ABILITY TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S LIABLE. WHEN OFFICERS USED. FORCE VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. AT THE SAME SABRINA COULD HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT VIEW SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE JUST SO INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS. ANY INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS SUED FOR MONEY DAMAGES. EVEN IF THERE'S INDEMNIFICATION. CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE UNLESS ABSOLUTE QUALIFIED IMMUNITIES OVERCOME. YEAH ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY IS RELEVANT WITH REGARD TO POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE A POLICE OFFICER CAN NEVER BE HELD LIABLE FOR TESTIMONY GIVEN AS A WITNESS EVEN IF THE OFFICER COMMITS PERJURY. IN DISCOVERS LOW WHO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE SUPREME COURT SAID NO POLICE OFFICERS CAN EVER BE SOLICITED FOR MONEY DAMAGES PROTEST OF THE GIFT EVEN AS PERJURIOUS. AND EVEN APART FROM ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY ALL OFFICE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. THE SUPREME COURT SAID JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY QUOTE FITS ALL BUT THE PLAINLY INCOMPETENT FOR THOSE UNITS KNOWINGLY VIOLATE THE LAW. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID POLICE OFFICER LIABLE ONLY IF THE OFFICER VIOLATES CLEARLY ESTABLISHED LAW THAT EVERY OFFICER WOULD NOW. GIVE THIS SPRING. THIS WAS NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SO THE HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE IN CALIFORNIA IS BROKE FIRED STATE WHAT CHANGES. THE PRIMARY STATE LAW WITH REGARD TO HOLDING LEAST LIABLE. FOR MORE GENERALLY READING CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THE TOM BAIN SOUL RIGHTS ACT. NORMATIVELY IMPORTANT STATUTE WHAT REVISIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE IMPORTANT REVISIONS ARE DISCUSS THE HEARING THAT'S TO PROVIDE FOR DECERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF FIVE STATES THERE'S NO PROCEDURE THE CERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS. IT TOO EASILY FACILITATES AN OFFICER IS REMOVED MISCONDUCT. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST A VERY SPECIFIC CHANGES TO THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER CLEANING HANDS POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE IS TO CLARIFY THE INTENT REQUIREMENT UNDER THE BANYAN. WORDS TO RECENTLY INTERPRETED THE BANE ACT TO REQUIRE A DEGREE OF SPECIFIC INTENT THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO RECOVER. SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT THERE IS THE TRADITIONAL INTENT REQUIRED FOR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS THIS WOULD OVER. WHARTON DECISION JOYO COUNTY OF WHICH COUNTY LET'S SEE WHAT WAS THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE- IT MISCONSTRUE IS THE BANE ACT REPORTER THREAT. INTIMIDATION OR COERCION. INDEPENDENT A VIOLATION OF RIGHTS. IT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT UNDER THE BANKING ACT IS AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF RIGHTS BY A POLICE OFFICER OR ANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL TO CREATE LIABILITY. SECOND THE DANGER SHOULD BE ADVISED. TO LIMIT STATE LONG UNITIES. IN RECENT YEARS COURTS AND IN ORDER TO STAY LONG IT IS AN OFFENCE TO THE BANYAK. THAT'S GOOD. THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE AS A DEFENSE THE STATE LAW- UNITIES. AND SO IN RECENT YEARS THE COURT HAS SAID THAT JAIL STAFF CAN'T BE SUED ARE THE BANE ACT EVEN WHEN THEY DELIBERATELY INDIFFERENT TO INMATES IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION ON. WHERE TO SET THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE IMMUNE FROM MALICIOUS PROSECUTION. AND THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED SO THAT THERE ISN'T THE ABILITY TO USE THESE IMMUNITIES DEFENSE THE BANG AT. FINALLY IT SHOULD BE A PLAN ALLOWED FOR WRONGFUL DEATH THE DEBATE ACT WRONGFUL DEATH ACTIONS SHOULD BE PERMISSIBLE THE POLICE OFFICERS RATHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. CLAUSE TO MISCONDUCT AND THAT SHOULD BE THE MILLION LIABILITY. I THINK IF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES DECERTIFICATION CHANGING THE INTENT REQUIREMENT LIMITING ST ONE UNIT IS ALLOWING CLIENTS WRONGFUL DEATH WYCHECK NORMA STEPS TO INCREASING POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR pTESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE- WE STILL WANT TO GO TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE WHO'S JOINING US VIRTUALLY MISTER RUDY SALAS. TO ASK A QUESTION AND MISTER SUMMERS SKEPTICAL PLEASE STAY ON STAY ON SO THAT WE CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF YOU FROM MY COLLEAGUES SO MISTER SALAS WOULD YOU PLEASE MOVE FOR WITH YOUR QUESTION. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON PRECIADO WAS CHAIRMAN I JUST A QUICK QUESTION BASED OFF THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS A CURRENT PREVIOUSLY. ABOUT YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE INTRODUCED SOME WIGGLE TWELVE NINETY NINE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO FINISH THEIR INVESTIGATIONS. THAT'S MISCONDUCT AND WE WANT TO THOSE RECORDINGS ON THOSE FINDINGS TO GO TO POST. I WANTED TO JUST ASK OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS IF THAT WAS THE CORRECT. WAY TO GO TO HAVE THAT ALL REPORTED TO COME SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE. RESIGNING IN LIEU OF TERMINATIONS AND THEN. ACTUALLY SHIFTING- THESE OFFICERS WITH QUESTIONABLE- HISTORIES ARE TO. THAT SEEMS TO BE INTO A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS IF THEY GO TO COMMUNITIES UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SO I JUST WANTED TO GET- SOME EXPERTISE ADVICE ON THAT. ANYONE WANT TO TAKE THAT- THIS IS YES PLEASE MESSAGE YES. VALIDA GHOSTING. YEAH I THINK THAT- THOSE FINDINGS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ONE PART OF THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT IN FACT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITHIN THE LEGISLATION AIR AND YES AND THAT HELPS AND SUPPORTS AND PROPS UP THE IN LIEU RESIGNATION THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY PROVOKE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO OPINE ON THAT YOU KNOW THE FUTURE YES PLEASE. THIS IS CHEATING YEARS I I'VE- I BELIEVE THE- CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF A ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAUCES BILLS SO YES WE DID SUPPORT- THE BILL LAST SESSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING US KNOW THAT WE WANT TO GO TO- YOU CAN HOLD YOUR QUESTION MISTER ANDERSON WILL GO TO DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND THEY WILL GO TO MISTER. YES I WANT I WANT IT- THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO OBVIOUSLY HAVE- I DON'T TESTIFIED TODAY THIS MORNING IT'S BEEN REALLY. INFORMATIVE IT SEEMS THAT AS I'M LISTENING TO THIS HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THAT AT THAT ADDRESS VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD THAT. WE'RE WITH THE COMPUTER CAMERAS HAVE BEEN SEE YOU I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T TURN IT ON SORRY IDEA THAT I HAD BUT I WOULD LIKE TO- GET SOME GET SOME RESPONSE TO- PIECES OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT APPEARS AS IF. AS I'M LISTENING TO- MISTER I THINK IT IS MISTER HENDERSON- AND LISTING TO ALSO WHICH TO MARVEL AT NOON YES. THAT A PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE FACE THE CRUX OF THE SITUATION REST IN. IN BASICALLY COMMUNITY- AS WELL AS AS YOU ASKED MISTER CHAIR. HOW DO WE RESTORE CONFIDENCE- IT SEEMS ADDRESSES IN IN IN WHO'S ACTUALLY GOING TO. GET THE INFORMATION MAKE THE KIND OF DECISIONS WHAT ROLE DOES THE COMMUNITY PLAY. IN ALL OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE. WHERE WE ARE- WITH REGARDS TO EVEN IF WE GET DATA- DOESN'T GO TO THE COMMUNITY IF THERE'S A HEARING IT HOW. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE COMMUNITY'S ROLE IN THAT HEARING I KNOW WHAT SEVEN THREE ONE LAST. YEAR THAT THE BANE ACT WAS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE AND NOW I'M LISTENING TO. THE PROFESSOR FROM A LAW SCHOOL SAYING THAT YOU KNOW DOING THAT WORK THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DO. IS CRITICAL TO BASICALLY RESTORING CONFIDENCE AND GET INTO A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE AND THAT THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES IS SIGNIFICANT SO. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM- MR MARBLE AS WELL AS OF MISTER NUNEZ CONCERNING THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT I KNOW THERE WAS A BIG DEBATE ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THE COMMITTEE WHO'S ACTUALLY MAKING THE DECISION. AND I'M LISTENING TO OTHERS THEY WOULD NEED TO GO BACK THE POOR ACTED NEED TO GO TO. POST WORLD ENFORCEMENT AND THEY HAVE THEY THE CHAO THAT WE BECAUSE TOO OFTEN I HEAR IN THE- WHEN WE SAY WELL THAT WAS A HEARING TOOK PLACE AND THE DECISION WAS MADE. SO FORTH AND SO ON THE COMMUNITY COMPLETELY DISMISSES THAT THE CONCLUSION BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S A FOX WHAT. YOU'RE WATCHING HIM HOUSE IT'S YOU KNOW A LAW ENFORCEMENT VALUE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF FAIRNESS. AND THE RESULTS AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S ALWAYS CENTRAL SO I LIKE TO HEAR. YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSE TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE- PROFESSOR OF LAW AS WELL AS MISTER HENDERSON. IN TERMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. RECENTLY IN SAN DIEGO WE JUST PASSED A BILL TO ASICALLY- TO- ENFORCE COMMUNITY- PLEASE PUBLIC COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TERMS OF A POLICE REVIEW BOARD THAT REALLY HAD YOU'VE COOKED SUBPOENA POWER. AND ENGAGES PEOPLE AT A HIGHER LEVEL WHICH IS WHAT ONE OF THE DEMANDS WAS- THAT WAS THEN WE HAD TO GO TO COURT IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE. BUT BOB I'LL GO TO THE POLLS I GUESS IT IS TO GET IT DONE SO WHAT IS THEIR RESPONSE FROM THAT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE AS WE TALK ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CENTER AND THE CRUX OF IT IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION. YOU KNOW WHO'S MAKING WHO ARE YOU KNOW WHO'S ACCOUNTABLE CAN WE ACTUALLY CAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE INPUT IN TERMS OF DETERMINING. WHO NEEDS TO BE JUST CERTIFIED- AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SEEM TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE TALKING AROUND THE EDGES AND THEN WHEN HE GETS TO LEGISLATION. IT BECOMES A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WHEREVER- I THINK YOU MADE MENTION OF- BROWN MARVEL AND ALSO- CHEAP NOON YES. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AND THEY WILL GO TO MISTER HENDERSON AND ALSO- MR SHIMMERY SKI. THANKS GIPSON- DOCTOR WHATEVER. SHOULD QUITE- YOU KNOW I SOME OF THE- ISSUES THAT WE FACE LAST YEAR REGARDING THE SOME OF THE LEGISLATION WAS THE- WAS THE FAIRNESS IN THE DUE PROCESS PIECE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR US IT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR ALL. LABOR UNIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE. THAT EVERYBODY HAS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE DUE PROCESS IN REGARDS TO- HOW THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE METED OUT. WHAT THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. WE'VE ALWAYS APPROACHED- ANY TYPE OF LEGISLATION AND- YOU'RE VERY FAR OR VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT IN REGARDS TO YOU- THE LEGISLATION IN REGARDS TO EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO. WE REALLY RESPECT A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WERE WERE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO. HELP MARKET WHAT. AND HOW WE DEAL IN REGARDS TO YOU HOW THIS PROCESS WILL PLAY OUT- ALWAYS- DEPOSED IN A SENSE THAT BECAUSE IT IS THE LICENSING YOU'RE NOT REALLY LICENSING IT IS THE- PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. WITHIN THE STATE. I THINK THE MAKE UP OF THE POST THE COMMISSION HAD WITH ITS EXPANSION. TO ADDITIONAL SEATS. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. MEMBERS TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS- AND ALSO ALLOWING CLOSE TO MISSION TO DETERMINE. WHAT THE MAKE UP OF THAT LICENSING AGREEMENTS. I DON'T THINK IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE NORM I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER PROFESSIONS AND HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR LICENSING- YOU LOOK. AT SAPER TURNS- YOU KNOW THE LAWYERS ARE USING LAWYERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR LICENSE. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF BOUNDS TO EXPECT THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONG FOR PERFECTION. THAT POST IS THE DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER THAT OFFICERS TO KEEP THEIR. WHAT'S NOT. LARGE TO DISCUSS. SENATOR BRAD WELL I WE REALLY WANTED SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CAR. WITH REGARD TO WHAT YOU PROPOSE. WE FEEL THAT THERE WAS A ADEQUATE I. TO HAVE A- PROCESS. WHICH HAVE THAT DISCUSSION BECAUSE OF THE TRUCK IT'S- WE WILL COVER. NINETEEN WE TO. WITH THE PARTS BEING ACTIVELY IN. SIMILAR TO THE PRE YEARS. EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO. SB TWO THIRTY- I FEEL WILL HELP VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MUCH MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WHEN DETERMINING WHAT THE LICENSING LOOKS LIKE AND HOW TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES. WHATEVER BROUGHT UP BY SOME OF THE OTHER NASTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACHIEVING AS YOU WANT TO- WEIGH IN ON THAT'S DISCUSSION. IT THIS. THIS CHAIR YEAH I ARE I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT- HEARING OF DR WEBER'S COMMENTS ON IT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW IT IT'S THE PUBLIC FEELING LIKE THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN GETTING INVOLVED IN M. OR SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE DO ON OUR PERSONNEL THERE ARE LIKE ALL OTHER PERSONNEL INVESTIGATIONS. BAKER PRESENT MARVELED REMARK ABOUT THAT THAT THAT THE DUE PROCESS IS SIMILAR TO ALL THE DUE PROCESS AT EVERY OTHER EMPLOYEE GROUPS ESSENTIALLY FACE- CROWDER STATE- BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS- IS GETTING YOU KNOW THE I. THINK COST BECAUSE FOR ME. THEY ISSUE OR STE YES THESE MAKING THE SURFACE OF THESE FOLKS BEING PLACE OFFICERS AS THEY DO WITH POLICE ACADEMIES. AN ADVOCATE FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SO THEY REALLY TO ME THAT THE GOVERNING BOARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THERE IT IS AN APPOINTMENT OF THE GOVERNOR SO I THINK HAVING THE TRUST IN THEM. AND HAVING THE TRUST IN THE IN THE IN THE APARTMENT OF THEIR DIRECTOR AND IN THE PROCESS THAT'S PUT IN PLACE. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND I THINK THAT- AND I THINK THAT THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING. AN INDIE CERTIFICATION. I FEEL IS GOING TO- RESOLVE A NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES AND CONCERNS. BECAUSE MUCH LIKE MISTER HENDERSON I TALKED ABOUT ERECTOR HENDERSON. TALKED ABOUT HAVING THE BAD APPLE. YOU KNOW MAKES YOU THINK ALL APPLES MIGHT BE BETTER YOUR WARY OF THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE HAVE. BELIEVE ME THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT- THAT IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. OFFICERS THEN THE ACTUAL OFFICERS THAT WORK WITHIN THAT- A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND EVEN THEY AREN'T PRIVY TO THE INFORMATION THAT I THINK. THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THAT PERSON THAT WAS DISCIPLINED. FOR THE LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE THEY RECEIVED OR IF THEY RECEIVED ANY DISCIPLINE BECAUSE- IT SENDS THE RIGHT IT SENDS A MESSAGE. OF WHAT WE- WHAT WE STAND FOR WHAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE AND- THE MISCONDUCT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE CANNOT. A TOLERATE THANK YOU BRING YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT TO MOVE TO- PROFESSORS SOME RISKY. AND THEN WE WANT TO GO TO MISTER HENDERSON AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A- ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES- ELOISE REYES QUEUED UP TO ASK A QUESTION. SO IN THAT ORDER. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD VERY MUCH AGREE WITH THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER WAS SAYING. CIVIL LIABILITY FOR OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS WHEN THIS VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS TRULY ESSENTIAL. ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE POLICE TO KNOW THAT WHEN AN OFFICER VIOLATE SOMEBODY'S RIGHTS THE OFFICE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. ALSO FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER INJURIES THEY NEED COMPENSATION FOR THOSE INJURIES. AND I'VE ALSO SEEN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT CIVIL LIABILITY FOR DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICERS DOES CREATE THE INCENTIVE TO BETTER CONTROL POLICE BEHAVIOR. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE SPENT THE VOLATILITY IT'S GOING TO COME FROM REVISING THE BANYAK. IT'S NOT GOING TO COME FROM FEDERAL LAW. AND I'VE SEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OFTEN WILL NOT REFORM THEMSELVES IT'S THE EXTERNAL THREAT OF LITIGATION WITH THE REALITY OF LITIGATION THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT COURTS IN CALIFORNIA IF TO LIMITED DEBATE ACT BUT IT'S IN YOUR HANDS IS THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SOME SIMPLE. CHANGES THAT MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU MISTER HENDERSON OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND I WOULD SAY THAT AND THAT I AGREE A 100% WITH THE COMMENTS FROM DANGER MARIN SKI AND IS BRILLIANT INSIGHT AND ANALYSIS AND HOW THE LAW WORKS AND PART OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALK ABOUT WHY PUBLIC TRUST IS DIMINISHED ARE EXACTLY THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING IN TERMS OF DEFENSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE TO ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO. BUT WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE BENEFITS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHEN CHALLENGED ON TRANSGRESSIONS IT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF WHY PUBLIC TRUST HAS BEEN ERODED AND IN SPEAKING ABOUT THESE THINGS YOU KNOW FROM THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE CHANGE MARIN SKI OUTLINED VERY WELL HOW THE LAW WORKS AND PROTECTING- MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE LEGAL FAILED BUT EVEN THIS. INTERPRETATION OF CHALLENGES FOR OFFICERS IS A PART OF THE PUBLIC TRUST BEING ERODED AND I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW IF ANY- AN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISES LETHAL FORCE THEY ARE EVALUATED BY A PROSTITUTE REAL AGENCY INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN OFTEN CASES WE'LL SEE THOSE SAME ACTIONS WHEN THEY ARE USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT EVALUATED WITH A GRAND JURY AND GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THAT'S INDEPENDENT FROM AN AGENCY OR AN AGENT ACTING AS A PROSPECT FOR REAL AGE AND. TO EVALUATE BEHAVIOR THOUGH THOSE. SUBJECTIVE INTRANSIGENT DIFFERENCES WHEN WE E. VALUE WEIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOR SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF WHY THE PUBLIC HAS MISTRUST AND IT HAS ERODED THEIR TRUST AND WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE'RE EFINING WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE AND TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER THAT SHE POSED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY CAN DO AND WHAT ROLE THEY PLAY. AND I BELIEVE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MEASURE B. THAT SHE HAD TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS GOING AND I THINK IT'S BETTER BE THIS YEAR'S REFERENCING FROM SAN DIEGO THAT WAS JUST PASSED. THE ABSOLUTE ROLE SHOULD BE THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE INFORMED COMMUNITY CAN START BY GOING TO THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION AND ASKING WHAT IS OUR USE OF FORCE POLICY WHAT ARE OUR STATISTICS HOW IS THAT COMPARED WITH A RACE OVERLAY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SO THEY CAN SEE AND LEARN AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT POLICIES FROM CITY TO CITY I THINK THE REAL SOLUTION IS. I THINK SOLUTION IS TO PART ONE I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE FACING. POLICE REFORMS AND JUSTICE REFORMS AND A NEW DAY GOVERNMENT IS CHANGING AND COMMUNITIES ARE CHANGING ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE COMIN OUT OF. HOPEFULLY THE THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE ARE LIKELY TO FACE UNPRECEDENTED- FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS- NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT IN GENERAL BUT THERE ARE TOOLS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US ALL AROUND US THAT I THINK CAN BE BETTER USED AND I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT IN THIS SPEAKS A LITTLE BIT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LAW. AND THE CIVIL CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE THERE ARE ALREADY SOME CIVIL CHALLENGES THAT COME THROUGH OUR CITIES AND STATES VERY FREQUENTLY. THAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED AND A LOT OF PLACES AND A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS ARE NECESSARILY DOING THAT. THE SAME THING FOR INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS NOT JUST THE ALLEGATIONS BUT THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THEY FOUND THAT DATA NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED AS WELL. CONFLATED WITH THE INVEST THE INFORMATION THAT COMES FROM THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCIES THAT DO EXIST. I'VE SUBMITTED AND IF YOU GUYS DIDN'T GET COPIES JUST A RECORD OF SOME OF THE RECORDS THAT MY AGENCY RELEASES EVERY YEAR. THROUGH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ANALYZING EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT THAT COMES IN AND CLASSIFYING IT AS WELL AS THE SUSTAIN CASES. AND THE CASES THAT ARE CHALLENGED WHERE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE DISCIPLINE OR ACCOUNTABILITY RECORDS ARE. A LOT OF THESE THINGS ALREADY EXIST IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE USE OF IT I WILL SAY. THAT THAT- THE KEY TO ALL OF THAT IS WHO MAKES THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT AND IS ARE THOSE DECISIONS BEING MADE IN THIS THAT WORK BEING MADE. BY AND I THINK THIS WAS REFERENCE SEVERAL TIMES BY AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY AND THAT SHOULD E. A CIVILIAN AGENCY OUTSIDE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES AND IF THAT AGENCY DOES NOT EXIST THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO EXIST IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS BUT TO THE DEGREE THERE'S A GAP. OR A LACK OF FUNDING ARE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE PLAYING A ROLE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE PLAYING ABOUT- ROLE AND THAT'S EXPANDED UPON. TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT INDEPENDENT EVALUATION SHOULDN'T BE ASPIRATIONAL. AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PUBLIC TRUST WITHOUT HAVING INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE AGENCIES HAD I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE SOLUTION I THINK THE SOLUTION IS TO DEVELOP AND CULTIVATE. AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS- AND THAT INDEPENDENT PROCESS NEEDS TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN RELY UPON IT AND THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE PUBLIC CAN MEASURE AT THE PUBLIC CAN SEE IT. AND AGAIN THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE EVIDENCE BASED ON BASED ON THE DATA THAT GETS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR WORDS I COMPLETE YOUR QUESTION. YES AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M AND I'M HOPING THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE LISTENING BECAUSE MANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BEFORE MEMBERSHIP BEFORE- IN SOME FORM AND- AND WE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. WHAT ROLE DO WE PLAY BUT I WHAT I'M AS I'M LISTENING TO OF THE GENTLEMAN IT'S CLEAR THAT THAT THE ROLE WE PLAY OBVIOUSLY IS THAT WE MUST HAVE POLICY THAT IS UNIFORM. STATEWIDE WE TRIED THAT WOULD BODY CAMERAS AND I HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BODY CAMERAS YET WE HAVE NO STATE WIDE BODY CAMERA POLICY. AND IF YOU REMEMBER WE TRIED TO DO THAT AND IT WAS KILLED AND SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK BECAUSE- THEY SIMPLY IF AND THE SENATE HAVE TRIED TO DO MANY OF THESE THINGS AND I THINK AS OUR- AS OUR COMMISSION MEETINGS. AS THIS COMMITTEE MEETS WE PROBABLY NEED TO GO LOOK AT ALL THE BILLS AND WE HAVE SOME KIND OF THE NOT. A SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS THAT REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BECAUSE MANY OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE AND THAT MANY OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO ARE HERE- ON THESE PANELS HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND ONCE WE DECIDE THAT THESE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE HARD ISSUE OF ADDRESSING. THAT ISSUE- AS WELL AS A DRESSING IS AS SOMEONE IS MENTION THE IN THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF MUCH OF THE DISPARITY IN POLICING WHICH IS RACISM. AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT IN TERMS OF THE HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT LEADS US TO LOOKING AT A JOINT FLOYD THAT COMES OUT OF OUR WHOLE HISTORY OF LYNCHINGS AND BURNINGS AND- AND DISREGARD FOR THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND IT HAS RESULTED OVER THE YEARS AS WE HAVE NO IN THE DISK IN THE TREATMENT OF THEM IN BEING LESS THAN HUMAN SELF I THINK WE HAVE A BIG CHALLENGE AND I HOPE THAT WERE UP TO THE CHALLENGE IS THAT LEGISLATORS BUT THOSE OF US. ONE THIS PANEL WHO WANTED TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION I HOPE WERE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE AND- AND THAT WE LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE BEEN BUT DEAR THANK THEM THANK EVERYONE FOR THE V. INPUT I I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IN THE CONVERSATION. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP IN ITS PHASES AS AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO GO THANK YOU MISS IT HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ARE UP TO THE CHALLENGE I THINK EVERYONE IS COMMITTED TO DOING THE WORK TO- MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR BUT ALSO. CREATE A POLICY THAT SPEAKS TO- CHU. RIAM LAW. IS THAT CALIFORNIA THAT SAID. WE HAVE- A MEMBER L. RAMOS ON THE LINE. PLEASE OPEN YOUR MICROPHONE OR CAMERA AND YOU CAN PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE. DR WEBER FOR HER COMMENTS. I THINK BACK TO TWO AB THREE NINETY TWO AND ALL OF THE DISCUSSION REGARDING EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATED THAT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO VOTE AFTER ALL THE DISCUSSION OF AND- HAVE BEEN HAD. WE RECEIVED THE NOTICE FROM PORAC THAT THEY HAD WITHDRAWN THEIR- THEIR THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THEY HAD ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH DR WEBBER WHICH WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I REALLY I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- BUT MR TEACHER I THE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE TITLE OF TODAY'S. HEARING WHY IS IT SO HARD TO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT THAT IS THE PERFECT QUESTION TO BE ASKED AND I THINK THAT. AS AN ATTORNEY IN THIRTY YEARS AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF SO MANY. IT IS WHAT WE NEED IS TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES IT'S TOO EASY TO SAY. NOBODY WANTS THE BAD APPLES NOBODY WANTS WE ALL WANT TO HOLD OUR POLICE ACCOUNTABLE WE THEY THEY GO TO THE GOOD POLICE DO NOT WANT TO THE BALLOT POLICE GETTING AWAY WITH THINGS. SOMEHOW THEY DO THEY DO GET AWAY WITH IT- SO CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- DEAN CHAMBER IN SKI I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE NOT JUST ON THIS TOPIC BUT ON SO MANY OTHERS- I SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR VOICE. AND I AM SO GLAD THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE CHAIR GIPSON- INVITED YOU TO BE PART OF THIS PANEL BECAUSE YOUR VOICE WAS NEEDED HERE IT ABSOLUTELY WAS NEEDED HERE AND I THINK THAT. THE YEARS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A VERY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT REVISING THE PAIN ACT IS SOMETHING THAT- DR WEBER'S TALKED ABOUT. AND HAS- BROUGHT THIS TO ON MANY OF. AND I THINK HEARING YOUR VOICE ON THIS- REMINDS US. THAT THAT IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE OTHER PART IS AS IS THE MATH MUCH OF BY SOMEBODY IS EXPANDING TRUST. SO WE HAVE T CLOSE LOOPHOLES WITH EXPAND THE TRUST AND THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY ANSWER BUT IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT. ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT IS THAT WE HEAR OPPOSING VIEWS REGARDING THE COMMUNITY AND CIVILIAN- PURCHASE A PATIENT. IN THE OVERSIGHT ON THE ONE HAND WE TALK ABOUT CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT OF AGENCIES BEING PART OF THE EVALUATION ON THE OTHER HAND WE HEAR THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE WHO HAVE THE TRAINING WHICH- NECESSARILY EXCLUDES OUR COMMUNITY. THAT ONLY THOSE WHO HAD THE POLICE TRAINING TO BE PART OF THE VALUATION ON POLICEMEN MISCONDUCT. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS. SHE IS THE REASON THE QUESTION SHOULD THE COMMUNITY- SHOULD BE USED SO BILLION OUT PARTICIPATION BE PART OF THE EVALUATION WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICE MISCONDUCT. MISTER HENDERSON WANTS TO TAKE THE QUESTION FOLLOW WITH- DEAN SOME RISKY SURE SO I WILL JUST SAY JUST SPEAKING TO THAT QUESTION SPECIFICALLY HAVING CIVILIANS AND HAVING TRAINED PROFESSIONALS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE I THINK THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CREDIBILITY THAT WE HAVE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS SET ON SOME OF THESE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS REVIEW SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS EXAMINE AND BE A PART OF THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS AND THAT'S INFORMED BY IT LED BY OR PARTNERED WITH. TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT DO INVESTIGATIONS TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT DO HAVE LEGAL BACKGROUNDS TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCIPLINE THAT'S MADE IT SO DIFFICULT PART OF THE CHALLENGE I THINK IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY INDEPENDENT TRACKS. THAT DISAPPOINT THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF WHAT DISCIPLINE COULD LOOK LIKE AND IT'S SEPARATED FROM WHAT THE PUBLIC BELIEVES DISCIPLINE SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND TO THE DEGREE WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY TODAY WE CAN REDUCE AND ELIMINATE OR LOWER SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS BY HAVING AN INTENTIONALITY. OF SHARING INFORMATION MORE BROADLY WITH THE PUBLIC AND HAVING THEM SIT AT THE TABLE I DON'T THINK- THAT WE SPEAK TO OUR DEAL WITH OR ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC TRUST. BY THAT NOT HAVING THE COMMUNITY AT LEAST BE INVITED OR HAVING A DIRECT SEAT AND PART OF THE PROCESS. TO UNDERSTAND OR AT LEAST HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS THAT WE END UP PUTTING TOGETHER. TO SHAPE OR IMPROVE THE SYSTEM THAT WORK WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT COMING UP WITH SOME OF THOSE SOLUTIONS I DO. I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY. HAS IT AT THE VERY LEAST ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. AND AT THE BEST END OF THE SCALE HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE OF PARTICIPATION AND WHAT THOSE PROCESSES COULD LOOK LIKE AT I THINK HAVING THOSE DOORS BE OPEN IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT. AND AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AS TO WHAT THIS CAN LOOK LIKE A LOT OF THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC WAY TO HAVE. A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY I WILL SAY THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN NOT FOR- AN OUTLINE. OF WHAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THESE AGENCIES SO THAT WE ALL KNOW AND IT'S NOT A CATCH AS CATCH CAN COUNTY TO COUNTY WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED WHAT TYPES OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION WILL THEY BE LOOKING AT. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MOVEMENT'S THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WHEN WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT- LIKE THE MEASURE B. AND SAN DIEGO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY FOCUSED ON WAYS. SPECIFICALLY EXPANDING THEIR JURISDICTION AN ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND THAT'S OF MOVEMENT THAT'S TAKING PLACE JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION BUT THOSE ARE LOCAL EXPANSIONS THAT'S LOCAL LEGISLATION. IF WE HAD FEDERAL I MEAN FOR A STATE LEGISLATION TAKING THE PLAY AND DEFINING WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED WITH AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE TRANSPARENT TO CIVILIAN AGENCIES. THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES ALL COMMUNITIES HAD ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AND I WILL SAY IS THAT A FINAL CABBIE OUT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT TODAY. THE ROLE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO PLAY IN PURSUING THAT ROLE AND SHARING THAT INFORMATION THIS PAST ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TRANSGRESSIONS WE TALKED ABOUT. AND A LOT OF THE FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE ALLUDED TO AND MANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS TYPICALLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THE MOST THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. ALL WOULD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN PLAY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION THAT WAS THE AGENCY WHERE WE SEE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING. THAT'S THE AGENCY THAT EVALUATES THE PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF VALUATION. THAT IS THE AGENCY OF THOSE O THE LAWYERS THAT HAVE BEEN CUT TO LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT THEY WERE. FROM THE OBAMA LEFT A GLARING HOLE AND AN OPPORTUNITY FALLING BACK FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE WORK. WITH OUT LEADERSHIP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO FIX SOME OF THESE ISSUES. MY POINT IS BEING TO BRING IT FULL CIRCLE TO WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. RATHER THAN HAVE A SOLUTION COME UP AND PALM SPRINGS. THAT DOESN'T EXIST AND SAN JOSE ARE HAVE A MODEL AND LOS ANGELES THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN FRESNO. WE CAN INSTITUTIONALIZE WHAT ACCESS LOOKS LIKE WHAT- AND WHAT DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION LOOKS LIKE WHAT DATA LOOKS LIKE. AT THE STATE LEVEL THROUGH LEGISLATION ABSOLUE ACTION THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO EVERYONE THAT WOULD LIFT ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES HERE IF THEY HAD STANDARDS TO EXPECT. THAT WOULD BE SHARED WITH THEM THAT DAY THEMSELVES IF THERE WEREN'T MEASURES ALREADY PUT IN PLACE TO BOTH ANALYZE AND TAKE ACTION ON TO INFORM THE POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT RACE NEUTRAL. POLICING AT AND THAT WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT CORNERSTONE I THINK TO JUSTICE REFORMS CAN I AM PLEASE GO TO- DEAN I'M SURE MARIN SKI FOR A FOLLOW UP FOR THAT- TO EXPOUND THE QUESTION AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE- MEMBER- REBECCA BAUER K. HAD ON THE LINE TO ASK A QUESTION. SO DEAN'S IMMERSED GEAR USED TO WITH THE SECOND I AM. I WANT TO TALK AGREE WITH MR HENDERSON IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. IT'S NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN CIVILIAN PARTICIPATION AND ONLY PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION IT HAS TO BE A SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES CIVILIAN INVOLVEMENT. IN PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION. CIVILIAN COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IN ORDER FOR THE PROCESS TO HAVE CREDIBILITY. BUT ALSO CIVILIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BRING A PERSPECTIVE IT'S ESSENTIAL IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE JUST DECISIONS. I THINK IT'S MISTER HENDERSON SAID IT THE VERY LEAST THIS HAS TO BE WITH REGARD TO INFORMATION BEING AVAILABLE. SO I MADE IT MORE STRONG AND SAYING THAT HAS TO BE WITH THE GUARD TO PARTICIPATION IN TERMS OF DECISION MAKING. I DON'T THINK AT THIS MOMENT TIME OR MAYBE EVER THEY'LL BE CREDIBILITY. OR JUST DECISIONS UNLESS YOU HAVE CIVILIANS WORKING WITH PROFESSIONALS. IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU MISS REYES ARE YOU COMPLETE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH NEXT WE WANT TO GO TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN- REBEKAH BAUR CARED FOR HER QUESTION SHE'S ON THE LINE. YEAH IF YOU COULD THANK YOU YES GREAT HIT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR THIS REALLY ENLIGHTENING CONVERSATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED MY COLLEAGUE MISTER S. MENTIONED WHICH IS IT'S IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND WHY ALTHOUGH WE WANT THE BAD APPLES TO BE REMOVED FROM. THE POLICE FORCES IT IS SO DIFFICULT AND I'M NOT I WANT TO ASK A REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTION TO MISTER HENDERSON INDIAN CHAMBER AND SKI ABOUT POPE ARE THE POLICE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE ROLE I PLAYS OBVIOUSLY OF MANY PEOPLE MENTION TAKING SOMEBODY'S LIVELIHOOD AWAY IS A VERY SERIOUS THING AND DUE PROCESS. IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US HOLD DEAR AS LOVERS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RIGHTS INSTILLED IN EACH US BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM SO BURDENSOME THAT DUE PROCESS GOES A STEP TOO FAR MAKES IT TOO DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FAT OFFICERS SO I WANT TO ASK. WHAT. ROLE DOES WHO ARE PLAYING THAT'S- AND WHAT THE ZIP. ARE THERE PRINCIPLE OF OUR- THAT ARE SO BURDENSOME THAT THEY STAND IN THE WAY OF DISCIPLINING OFFICERS AND DON'T ADD MUCH TO THAT RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. I WILL SAY IF I CAN JUST JUMP IN JUST- FOR THAT THE WHOLE BAR PLAYS AND ABSOLUE ROLE IN HELPING TO FIND THE THINGS THAT WE ALLUDED TO BEFORE AND BOTH. SPECIAL DEFENSES AND BENEFITS THAT ARE ALLUDED TO THE PROFESSION OF POLICING AND SO. EIGHT A GAIN I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGES ARE AND HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED. IT THERE THERE ARE NO MANDATES AND POOL BAR THAT HELP IN CAR OR THEY'RE NOT MANY- EDICTS AND PROBAR THAT HELP ENCOURAGE SUPPORT- THE WORK BEING DONE FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY IN TERMS OF COLLECTING DATA. SHARING DATA AND ANALYZING DATA AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THOSE ARE. EASY AND MAYBE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO LOOK TO PULL BAR TO DO THOSE THINGS WHICH IS WHY IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEADERSHIP TO TAKE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT THEY ARE. ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS AND POPE ARE ABOUT HOW- AT LEAST FOR MYSELF AS A CIVILIAN AGENCY. IS LIMITED AND- IN THE TRACK THAT I HAVE TO PURSUE TO GET ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE CASE OF THE COMING BASED ON COMPLAINTS THAT COME IN POPE ARE LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I CAN CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION COBAR LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT I CAN SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE DEMANDS THAT I GET. REGULARLY I MEAN SEPARATE FROM THE DEMANDS THAT ARE ALREADY BUILT INTO THE LAW INCLUDING FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DEMANDS THAT COME IN ALL THE TIME ABOUT MY RECORD I HEAR FROM AGENCIES LIKE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AT ACE LOCAL AND FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL ALL THE TIME. ASKING MORE ABOUT MY INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT I'M BARRED FROM SHARING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT AND THE CRIMINAL COURTS I'M I'M ASKED FREQUENTLY FOR INFORMATION THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT AND THE CIVIL COURTS FROM AGENCIES THAT ARE ARE PURSUING- NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE CLAIMS THAT I'M RESTRICTED FROM SHARING EVEN WHEN BEYOND JUST AN INVESTIGATION I HAVE ACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUSTAINED FINDINGS. FOR BEHAVIOR I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF WHAT POOL BAR IS AND IT'S USED HAS- SHIELD AND A SWORD FOR SOME OF THE WORK BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN START UNPACKING IT AND I'M I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THE INSURANCE HE'S GOING TO SAY HAS A WELL ABOUT SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED AT THE STATE LEVEL TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. WERE GREAT GREAT- DANGEROUS GAVE YOU CAN WEIGH IN BECAUSE WE HAVE ABOUT TO GET ABOUT TEN MINUTES WILL GO RIGHT AHEAD PLEASE WELL IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE AND FORCING YOU TO EXCUSE MYSELF BUT I WILL MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE COMMITTEE IN ANYWAY I NEED ASSISTANCE I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT OFFICER SHE RECEIVED TWO PROCESS BEFORE THEIR DISCIPLINE. HOWEVER MUCH OF HOBART DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH DUE PROCESS FOR OFFICERS I WOULD FOCUS ON WHAT MISTER HENDERSON WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH- BAR AT. LIMITS THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION BUT- BY OFFICER. THEN CONFRONTS. CIVIL SUITS TO POLICE. EITHER SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHERE THE BANYAK AND JUST TO FOCUS ON THAT ONE ASPECT OF OUR- RESTRICTIONS ON INFORMATION BEING ABLE TO BE AVAILABLE IN THIS WITH MISCONDUCT. COULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY ACT WHEN ASSEMBLY ONCE EARLIER AND HELPFUL IN THE QUEUE. LOOPHOLE IT WOULD REALLY MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY TO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN HIS MISCONDUCT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RPK YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION ARE YOU COMPLETE. I AM COMPLETELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO OTHER MEMBERS IN THE QUEUE- SO THAT LIVE HERE I WANT TO SUGGEST SEN YES MR SEN. IT'S CUNNINGHAM MISTER CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US APPRECIATE IT- PLEASE PROCEED WE HAVE ALL THESE ATTORNEYS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I TELL YOU. MISTER CUTTING HIM PLEASE- YEAH SO THIS IS SOMETHING OF A STATEMENT SOMETHING OF A QUESTION ON THE ISSUE OF CLOSING LOOPHOLES. AND LIKE MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS- I HAD MY OWN BILL LAST. SESSION AB FIFTEEN NINETY NINE THAT WOULD THAT WAS SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE ACCUSED OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. LETHAL FORCE LYING ON THE JOB SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON THE JOB- WE HAVE SEEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR RARE FORTUNATELY BUT THEY HAPPEN WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO RESIGN BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION- WHETHER IT'S AND I A OR A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. AND ESSENTIALLY BURIED THE RECORDS FROM EVER COMING TO LIGHT OF DAY THEY'RE NOT TOUCHABLE WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST I YOU CAN'T GET THEM- SO MY BILL MADE IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR STALLED OUT IN THE SENATE- I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE WE SHOULD. THINK ABOUT REVISITING WITH LEGISLATION- AND WE HAD WORK SOMETHING OUT THERE WAS A FRAMEWORK THERE THAT HAD BEEN WORKED OUT WITH- WITH POLICE CHIEFS WERE SHARES AND WITH PORAC- THAT WOULD PROTECT THE OFFICERS FROM HAVING RECORDS RELEASED THAT MADE THEM LOOK BAD. WHERE THE INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY- WAS ON SUSTAIN OR- RESULTED IN EXONERATIONS THE OFFICER. SO I MEAN WE'RE TALKING A VERY NARROW SLICE OF THINGS HERE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT IS INVESTIGATED- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S. COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION AND ARE NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXPLOIT THIS LOOPHOLE WHERE THEY THEY CAN RESIGN AND ESSENTIALLY STOPPED INVESTIGATION AND THEN YOU DON'T. HAVE ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER A FINDING AT ALL WHETHER SUSTAINED MISCONDUCT FINDING OR EXONERATED FINDING OR AND I'M SUSTAIN THE EVIDENCE WASN'T CLEAR TO SAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER- SO I THINK THAT'S- AND THAT FITS RIGHT INTO THE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FRAMEWORK FROM SKINNER'S BILL FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IT IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE- THAT HAS BEEN EXPLOITED AND IT ALSO PROTECTS THE OFFICERS BECAUSE IT IT WOULD CLARIFY ALSO. THAT IF YOU. ARE IF THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE AND YOU WERE EXONERATED OR THERE WASN'T ASSISTING FINDING MISCONDUCT- THEY COULD REST ASSURED THAT THOSE RECORDS WOULD NOT COME OUT IN THE PUBLIC. AND SUBJECT THEM TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY THAT WAS ON WARRANT SO I THINK WE CAN PICK UP ON THAT I'M JUST MORE THROWING THIS OUT THERE I DON'T NEED. NECESSARILY UNLESS SOMEBODY'S GOT A COMMENT FROM THE PANEL APPRECIATE DETERRENCE KEY DATA MY- ALMA MATER THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. IF YOU STILL AROUND BUT- I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE IS AN IDEA FOR. SOMETHING THAT WE COULD WORK ON THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE. A BIPARTISAN- SUPPORT AND IT'S A IT'S A LEGISLATIVE. FIX TO A LOOPHOLE THAT THAT RESULTS IN- OFFICERS BEING ABLE TO RESIGN UNDER A CLOUD OF STREET NEAR INVESTIGATION FROM ONE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN GO TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT- AND THE PUBLIC NEVER KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IT'S HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT SEVERAL TIMES. ALREADY WE'VE RECEIVED OFFICERS THAT LEFT OTHER DEPARTMENTS- THEY HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT THEY COMMITTED SIMILAR MISCONDUCT. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A 1% OF OF BAD APPLES I TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS QUITE SMALL- BUT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE TRUST. AND TRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOLKS THAT SERVE THE COMMUNITY- WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW OF TO RESTORE THAT TRUST. SO YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMENT I APPRECIATE THE TIME THANK YOU HAVE- MISTER HENDERSON WANT TO RESPOND AND THEN WE HAVE ABOUT- FOUR MINUTES BEFORE WE START GOING ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL DELIBERATIONS. SO MR ANDERSON YEAH I WAS GONNA AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MAYBE SOME WOMEN SAID BUT ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT THE OTHER- AGENCY I JUST WANNA KEEP REITERATING THAT THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHTS THAT DO THE ACCOUNTABILITY ARE ALSO RESTRICTED WHEN THAT PROCESS HAPPENS MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE. JURISDICTION TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS EVEN THOUGH THEY OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND THAT JUST EXACERBATES THE NEED TO HAVE. SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE MORE DIRECTLY I WILL SAY THERE ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AND AGGRESSIVE ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THESE-TRANSGRESSIONS THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEASUREMENTS AND MARKERS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON TO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THIS WHILE WE'RE ALL HAVING A CONVERSATION. SOME OF THOSE CAN BE FOUND IN RECORDS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND I WILL SAY IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CONFLATION OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN. THROWN OUT AND MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS THEIR OFTENTIMES RECORDS IN THERE THAT INDICATE BAD BEHAVIORS FROM OFFICERS THAT CAN BE EVALUATED ALSO IN THE CIVIL LAWSUITS THAT TAKE PLACE. SO EVEN WHEN AN OFFICER IS ALLOWED TO GET OUT FROM A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION THAT RESULTS AND CRIMINAL ACCOUNTABILITY ARE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS- ACCOUNTABILITY OR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THEY'VE LEFT. THERE'S OFTENTIMES A LAWSUIT THAT SOMETIMES RESULTS AND FINDINGS AND INFORMATION THAT SHINES THE LIGHT ON MANY OF THESE TRANSGRESSIONS AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND BUDGET. WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT WHERE THOSE RECORDS ARE BEING CREATED THAT ARE SHINING THE LIGHT ON WHO THOSE BAD ACTORS ARE. WHERE THOSE TRANSGRESSIONS ARE. AND I THINK CONNECTING THE DOTS THAT THAT THOSE TRANSGRESSIONS. DON'T KEEP REOCCURRING HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AT A BROADER LEVEL TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE PATTERNS ARE TO INFORM POLICY. DECISIONS THAT NEED TO CHANGE THAT OFTENTIMES IS USED AS A SHIELD AND I'M RELY. TO BAD BEHAVIORS WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT. OBVIOUSLY AGAIN HAS DISPARATE IMPACT ON COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIEUTENANT- GHOSTING ARE YOU STILL WITH US. I AM DO YOU WANT TO WAY AND WE HAVE ABOUT THREE MINUTES AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU WE'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE SO. DO YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON ANY ASPECT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'VE HEARD THUS FAR. FOR FINAL COST SURE AYE AYE. YEAH I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR- THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY ENGAGE IN A PROCESS THAT LOOKS AT EVERYTHING. OUR THAT IS BEEN SAID HERE TODAY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE ISSUE OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE HOW TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES BUT- I WANNA GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO MY INITIAL COMMENTS ABOUT ARBITRATION. AND HAL HELLO THE ARBITRATION PROCESS ITSELF CAN ALSO CREATE OBSTACLES TO AFFECTED- DECERTIFICATION AND SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION OFFICERS. THAT HAPPENED BACK BEEN FIRED. AND THEN ARBITRATORS HAVE REINSTATED THEM AGAINST THE WILL OF THE CITY AND THE POLICE. AND THE ADMINISTRATOR AND SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX AND LAYERED- SITUATE WHERE WE TO LOOK AT HOW NOT JUST POPE MARKETS SERVICE STATUES. ARBITRATION COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. ALL CAN IMPACT A ROBUST DECERTIFICATION PROCESS IN BUT WE CAN'TDEAL WITH OUT CIVILIAN. INPUT I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WHETHER YOU HAVE A LEGISLATION THAT I THINK IS MISTER HENDERSON HAS STATED THAT GIVES GUIDANCE TO EVERY. AGENCY THAT FORMS THEIR OWN CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT REVIEW BOARD THAT THAT CAN MAKE RECOMMEND ATIONS TOWARDS DECERTIFICATION AND THAT PROCESS AS WELL. THIS IS A THIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT WORK BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DISPARITIES IN POLICING WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THE HISTORY OF POLICING. IN OUR COUNTRY THAT GOES BACK NOT JUST YOU KNOW TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT THE IT BUT ITS ENTIRETY AND HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN USED. IN IN MANY ASPECTS IN THE WRONG WAY WHETHER IT WAS AN AS SLAVE CATCHERS IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW OR WHETHER IT'S THE DISPARITIES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR DRUG LAWS WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE. LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITY AND ZAYN OPEN ACCESS ENGAGING DATA COLLECTION THAT PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAYS OF DOING IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TENER FOR YOUR COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL- THIS WILL CONCLUDE- THIS PANEL IN THIS SEGMENT. OF POLICE DISCIPLINE AND SO WE WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL DEAL LITIGATION BUT ALSO WANT TO. MAKE A POINT THAT. ALL OF OUR THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAFFS ARE WATCHING THESE HEARINGS AND THEY'RE TAKING COPIOUS NOTES AND THEY WILL GET TOGETHER AND SHARE ALL THE INFORMATION ALL THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT SOMEONE LET PEOPLE KNOW. THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE RECORDING TO REFER BACK TO WILL ALSO HAVE TO- SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TEAMS THAT ARE WATCHING THESE HEARINGS IN TAKING COPIOUS NOTES TO HELP US- AND REFLECTING BACK ON SOME OF THE VERY POIGNANT- ASPECTS OF TODAY'S HEARING SOMEONE SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ANDERSON. FOR YOU BEING HERE PERSONALLY AND THANK ALL OUR FOR ALL OF OUR OTHER PANELS. OF PANELISTS TO BEING HERE I'M DOING SOME RISKY- THE TENANTS- DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; GOLDSTINE AND ALSO CHIEF&lt;/c&gt; NOON YES AND ALSO BRIAN MARVEL- THANK YOU ALL IS BEEN A LIGHTNING CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. AND OUR NEXT PANEL WE WILL BE DEALING WITH- POLICE LITIGATION EACH PANEL WILL HAVE UP TO SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES- AND- WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES WITH IN THAT SIXTY EIGHT MINUTES WHO YOU ARE AND- AND- YOUR BACKGROUND AND THEY MOVE RIGHT INTO YOUR PRESENTATION. THE FIRST PERSON GONNA HAVE DAVID EATEN A STAGNANT- WHO WILL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY. MISTER MISTER ACNE ARE YOU WITH US. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US AND YOU MAY PROCEED- WHEN READY AND YOU HAVE EIGHT SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON AND% THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR. MY NAME IS DAVID MISS STAGNATE MY PRACTICE FOCUSES. ON REPRESENTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS MY LAW ENFORCEMENT CLIENTS UNDERSTAND THE CONTINUING NEED FOR POLICE REFORM. KELLY AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. ORDING LEAVE WE HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEADERSHIP TO MODERNIZE USED TO FORCE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED STATEWIDE USE OF FORCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS AND TRAINING AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO AND I WILL EXPLAIN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AFFORDED ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. MY TIME IS SHORT BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MY CLIENTS SUPPORT A LICENSING REVOCATION PROCESS TO ASSIST IN STRIKING THE PROPER BALANCE THAT ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE SHARED CONCERNS OVER BAD OFFICERS AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY. WHILE MAINTAINING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS FOR INNOCENT OFFICERS. WITH RESPECT TO THAT DO I'D THAT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. IT'S FIRST IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT OFFICERS ARE SUBJECTED TO GREATER SCRUTINY AND HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. THE PENAL CODE MANDATES THAT EVERY AGENCY ESTABLISH AND PUBLICIZE A PROCESS FOR ACCEPTING COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT AGAINST OFFICERS AND ALSO MANDATES THE INVESTIGATION OF THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT'S NOT TRUE IN EVERY STATE. THE PROCESS COMMENCES WHEN A COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT IS RECEIVED. IMPORTANTLY INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT LIMITED TO COMPLAINTS BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND IN FACT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT A MAJORITY OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION ARE GENERATED BY COMPLAINTS FROM SUPERVISORS OR MANAGERS. THE AGENCY THEN BEGAN INTERVIEWING WITNESSES AND INVESTIGATING THE CASE IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE ACCUSED OFFICERS INTERROGATED LAST. THE ACCUSED IS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE INVESTIGATION TYPICALLY UNTIL A FEW DAYS BEFORE HIS OR HER INTERROGATION. THE INTERROGATION PROCEDURES MAYOR THE PROCEDURES AFFORDED UNDER WHAT'S CALLED WEINGARTEN RIGHTS AND ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL UNION MEMBERS BOTH UNDER THE MYERS MALAISE BROWN ACT AND UNDER THE NLRB. THE POLICE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN THE FIREFIGHTER BILL OF RIGHTS LARGELY JUST CODIFIED THESE WEINGARTEN RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT HAPPENS AT THE INTERROGATION GIVES BASIC. REQUIREMENTS SAID OFFICERS HAVE A RIGHT TO A REPRESENTATIVE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO RECORD THE INTERROGATION THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO USE THE RESTROOM. THE NOTICE IS ALSO SIMILAR UNDER POOL BAR AND WINE GARDEN. ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEE AND OFFICERS ARE ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS THIS IS VERY LIMITED INFORMATION OUR SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT OF ACCESS TO ANY OF THE INVESTIGATION INFORMATION IS MERELY THINGS LIKE YOU'RE CHARGED WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE FROM THIS PARTICULAR DATE OR THIS PARTICULAR CASE. AND IT'S INTENDED TO GIVE THEM NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THAT OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE THEY CAN BE COMPELLED EVEN WENT AND CRIMINAL JEOPARDY ATTACH IS TO THE ALLEGATIONS. ONCE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED THE AGENCY RENTER'S FINDINGS THESE ARE TYPICALLY EITHER FRIVOLOUS EXONERATED UNFOUNDED NOT SUSTAINED OR SUSTAINED. IF IT'S SUSTAINED THEN A CORRECTIVE OR DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS PROPOSED IF IT'S ANY OF THE OTHER FINDINGS THEN OBVIOUSLY NO ACTION IS TAKEN. THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDE ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA A PROPERTY INTEREST IN THEIR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AD A DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO APPEAL ANY DEPRIVATION OF THAT PROPERTY INTEREST. THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS DELEGATES THE AUTHORITY TO THE EMPLOYING AGENCY TO ESTABLISH WHAT THAT ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL PROCEDURE IS FOR THE STATE IT'S MOSTLY THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THE PROCESS VARIES GREATLY. MOST HAVE SOME FORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION OR A CIVIL SERVICE BOARD THAT OFTEN EMPLOY HEARING OFFICERS OR ARBITRATORS TO MAKE ADVISORY DECISIONS SOME AGENCIES HAVE ARBITRATION. UNDER ANOTHER SUPREME COURT CASE SKELLY VERSUS STATE PERSONNEL BOARD PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HAVE A RIGHT TO RESPOND PRIOR TO THE IMPOSITION OF DISCIPLINE TO ANY PROPOSED ACTION OF A FIVE DAY SUSPENSION OR GREATER. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE AND THEN AFTER THIS KELLY HEARING WHICH IS REALLY TYPICALLY A MEETING. I LIKE A SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING THIS EVIDENTIARY OR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE DISPUTED FACTS AND RENDER LEGAL DETERMINATIONS BASED UPON THE FACTUAL FINDINGS. IF CHARGES ARE SUSTAINED GREAT DEFERENCE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCY PENALTY DETERMINATION AND THE FOCUS IS ON THE HARM TO THE PUBLIC AND THE LIKELY HAD A REOCCURRENCE THE FINAL APPEAL IS TO SUPERIOR COURT. I'VE HEARD COMPLAINTS THAT IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIRE ABOUT OFFICERS. THAT'S SIMPLY UNTRUE BUT HOPEFULLY THE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ALREADY ENACTED WILL BETTER INFORM THE PUBLIC. SUSTAIN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT NEARLY ALWAYS RESULT IN TERMINATION IN FACT PUBLISHED CASE LAW HOLDS THAT-IT'S AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION TO REINSTATE AN OFFICER WITH SUSTAINED. SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IN COAL LANDER THE COURT EXPLAINED THAT THE JOB IS A POSITION OF TRUST AND THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF BEHAVIOR FROM THOSE THEY INVESTED WITH THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF AN OFFICER'S DUTY THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT DISHONESTY IS BEING COMPATIBLE WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST. IN TERMS OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO WEEDING OUT BAD OFFICERS WE BELIEVE IT'S THE LACK OF A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. TO PREVENT AN OFFICER WHO ENGAGED IN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT FROM OBTAINING EMPLOYMENT AS A PEACE OFFICER IN ANOTHER AGENCY. THIS PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED WHEN OFFICERS RESIGNED PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF AN INVESTIGATION. INTO SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BECAUSE THE FORMER AGENCY WILL OFTEN SIMPLY CLOSED THE INVESTIGATION. WITHOUT COMPLETING IT. WE SUPPORT A SYSTEM WHERE AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE OFFICER RESIGNED BEFORE ITS CONCLUSION. WHERE THE AGENCY DETERMINATION AS REPORTED THE POST TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT CERTIFICATION SHOULD BE REVOKED. AND AS A MATTER OF DUE PROCESS AND THOROUGHNESS. WE BELIEVE THAT ANY DECISION ON DECERTIFICATION SHOULD BE. DEFERRED UNTIL AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL IS COMPLETED THE US POST HAS A COMPLETE RECORD TO CONSIDER AT THE REVO CATION STABBED AND WE AVOID. DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND INCONSISTENT FACTUAL AND LEGAL DETERMINATIONS. I KNOW MY TIME IS ABOUT UP I WILL TOO MANY QUESTIONS DURING THE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION REGARDING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND A DECERTIFICATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STAGNATE WE APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND ALSO REPRESENTING PUBLIC SAFETY UNIONS WE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. NEXT WE WANT TO MOVE. QUICKLY TO OUR NEXT- PRESENTER AND THAT'S JAMES ARE A TOUCHSTONE PARTNER AT JAMES EXCUSE ME JONES AND MAYER IS LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA. POLICE OFFERED POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION ARE YOU WITH US IS A TOUCHSTONE. YES I AM SIR. I CAN HEAR YOU VERY WELL AND WE CAN SEE YOU NOW SO PLEASE PROCEED YES- SIXTY EIGHT MINUTES- TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY. AND YOUR TIME IS STARTING WHEN YOU SAY YES. YES. THANK YOU YES MY NAME IS JIM TOUCHSTONE OF BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION SO IN THAT REGARD I KINDA HAVE A FINGER ON THE PULSE OF SO TO SPEAK- FOR THE STATEWIDE ON FORCING PRACTICES AND- CERTAINLY OPINIONS OF POLICE MANAGEMENT- MY FIRM- WE REPRESENT MANAGEMENT IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS IN FACT- MISTER MISDIAGNOSIS MIND MY COLLEAGUE YOU JUST HEARD FROM- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE TABLE ON. ON SOME ISSUES AND IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT MATTERS IN ADDITION I DEFEND- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND USE POLITICIAN SECTION. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE CASES. IN FEDERAL COURT. AND THROUGH MY- GENERAL COUNTS WORK FOR THESE VARIOUS ASSOCIATE OF HOW THE DISTINCT OF WAR ON SOME THE ALLEGED ACTIONS WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY INCLUDING SB FORTY TWENTY ONE THE PROVIDING MY OPINIONS AT LEAST FOR HOPEFULLY FOR CORPORATIONS- OR IS BILL AS FAR WHERE WE SHOULD GO WITHOUT. IN ADDITION CAL CHIEF SPONSOR THE SB TWO THIRTY WHICH OF COURSE UP. FOR OTHER MUNICIPALITIES AND THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE USE OF FORCE POLICIES COVERING VARIOUS TOPICS. AND SO- THAT OF COURSE IF A POLICY IS COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE PROVIDES FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IF OFFICERS VIOLATE THOSE POLICIES. NOW UNDER SPECIFICALLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT MANAGEMENT HAS WAS- HER THROUGH CHIEF NUNEZ EARLIER TODAY- IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND WITHOUT REGARD WE- WE ALSO SUPPORTED- AB TWELVE NINETY NINE TO DECERTIFICATION BILL SPONSORED BY SOMEONE SALAS LAST YEAR FOUND THAT ALSO PROVIDED. AND I THINK I WILL DEAL WITH SOME OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY AS FAR AS FAILING TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS AND SO FORTH ONE OFFICER LEAVES ONE AGENTS INDUSTRY ANOTHER. SALAS WILL DEAL WITH. SKEWS ME STREET RACING. AND I'M ALSO PERSON SUPPORT WITHOUT FACT I ADVISED AGE AND THAT I WHICH IS NOT YES THROUGH THE STATE. THAT THE PROPER METHOD TO ENGAGE IN IS TO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS EVEN IF AN OFFICER RESIGNS WHILE THOSE SPECIFIC CHARGES ARE PENDING. AND THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT OFFICER IS NOT SIMPLY MOVING ON TO ANOTHER AGENCY IN GOING DOWNSTREAM AND COMMITTING. OTHER OTHER SERIOUS FORMS OF MISCONDUCT AND SO FORTH. I WANTED TO KNOW FOR THE RECORD QUITE FRANKLY THAT IF A POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS A ROBUST BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. SYSTEM WHICH MOST DO IN MY EXPERIENCE THEN THOSE. WHEN THOSE FORMS OF MISCONDUCT ARE GOING TO BE DETERMINED THROUGH THE BACKGROUND PROCESS AND TYPICALLY THAT OFFICER IS NOT GOING TO BE HIRED ANYWAY THAT BEING SAID IT DOES HAPPEN IN A MINOR VERY MINIMAL I THINK I'M ONE OF THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S MENTIONED EARLIER OF 1% 1% IT DOES HAPPEN IN A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEREFORE THANK. ANPING THAT ISSUE UP BY WAY OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE DECERTIFICATION BILL WHICH REQUIRES COMPLETION OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. IT'S CERTAINLY A PROPER WAY TO GO IN ORDER TO AMELIORATE THAT KIND OF CONCERN. THAT IS WELL FOUNDED AND FRANKLY NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I CAN TELL YOU THE POLICE MANAGEMENT ARE GENERALLY SUPPORT OF THAT AS NOTED WE SUPPORTED TWELVE NINETY NINE OR WORKING ON BILLS. AS WE SPEAK- THAT HOPEFULLY WILL CLOSE THOSE MINOR RIPPLES ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY SOME OFFICERS. YEAH I'M NOT TO KIND OF GO BACK OVER THE NUTS BOLTS OF THE DISCIPLINARY. MY COLLEAGUES FROM STAGNANT COVERED OUT OF. VERY THOROUGH MANNER- I DIDN'T HAVE ANY DISTRICT WITH HIS. WAY THAT HE DESCRIBED. BUT- I WOULD ALSO KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW. AS MENTIONED MY- DOES JUST MANY. JUST MANY PROCEEDINGS ON BEHALF OF. AND SPECIFICALLY WE PROCESS LITTLE HUNDRED OF LOS OF ACTIONS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS SAID MANY OF WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN TERMINATION OF OFFICERS. FROM FAT HAVE SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT AND SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE A SUCCESS RATE OF ABOUT PROCEEDINGS SO. I DON'T REALLY SEE A HUGE OBSTACLE TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS FRANKLY I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMENTARY THAT THAT IS NOT IN FACT HAPPENING ON A REGULAR BASIS I WILL TELL YOU THAT'S TO THE CONTRARY OF MY EXPERIENCE IN PRACTICING LAW FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND WHAT THE STATISTICS THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO YOU SO. THAT BEING SAID OF COURSE ARE ALWAYS OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THE DECERTIFICATION BILL WAS ONE I THANK US CERTAINLY FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE ACCOUNT YOU SUPPORT THAT AS WELL AS ON THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE TO- CERTAINLY- I THINK THE VICE PUBLIC OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH RESPECT TO SERVICE- TYPES MISCONDUCT SO THAT THEY ARE WELL INFORMED. AND CAN HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE ENGAGING IN ROBUST INVESTIGATIONS AND TAKING APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AND UP SPECIFICALLY OVER THERE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT WE CAN IMPROVE ON WELL ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPROVED UPON. CLOSE WAS I THINK INADVERTENTLY CREATED BY SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IT IS A CODE SECTION EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN SUBDIVISION SEVEN SEAT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I THINK- IT ALLOWS. FOR THE SCHOOL. OF ADMINISTRATOR- THEN WE HUNDRED DAYS SO ON ONE ONE ITS- EIGHT PEACE OFFICER WHO IS THE- OF AN INTERN AFFAIRS. COULD GO TO ROCK A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION UP UNTIL THAT POINT AS IT MAY HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. YEAH THAT OF COURSE I THINK WE CONTRADICTS A SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. BECAUSE OF THE OFFICER IS MISTER STAGNANT INDICATED TYPICALLY INTERVIEWED LAST. AND CERTAINLY DURING THE PROCESS OF THE INVESTIGATION YOU DON'T SHOW YOUR HAND TO THE OTHER SIDE. OF THE INSULAR CONCLUSION OF IT THAT'S JUST BASICS ON INVESTIGATIVE. PROCESS SEES AND THAT HAS BEEN ON A KIND OF COMPLAINT OKAY DID IN THE LAW THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISIONS. PASADENA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION VERSUS THE CITY OF PASADENA. WHICH WAS HANDED DOWN IN NINETEEN NINETY- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE FURTHER PROLIFERATION OF BODY WORN CAMERAS. I RECOMMEND MY CLIENTS. ENGAGING IN RANDOM AUDIT. THE BOTTOM CAMERA FOOTAGE OF. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO ARE COMES WITH. POLICY AND ALSO COULD WITH LONG. BEYOND OUR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCREASE FUNDING FOR THAT FRANKLY MMHM I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE FURTHER PROLIFERATION OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS TRACKING PROGRAMS AS IT PROWER BOOTY. AND SPECIFICALLY- FUNDING FOR THAT B. I THINK HELPFUL AND- I MUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH- JEAN SHEMENSKI. I IS FOR IS APPROACHING POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY I DON'T THINK THAT INCREASING CIVIL LIABILITY IS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT I THINK THAT THE BETTER WAY OF HANDLING THAT QUITE FRANKLY IS INCREASED FUNDING FOR TRAININGS. FOR POST- THE LEGISLATURE'S. TAKE INCOME ARE RELY SEVERAL AND SO WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN INCREASE. FUNDING EVEN MORE SO- PORTRAY SUCH AS USE OF FORCE TRAINING IMPLICIT BIAS SO THAT OFFICERS CAN BE AWARE OF THOSE SUBJECTS ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS. AND THEREFORE KEEP IT IN THEIR MINDS UP AS ARE GOING OUT AND ENGAGING AND- THE PROVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES- OF CIVIL LIABILITY YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM THE- MANY. PLACE AGAIN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FEW OF THE CIVIL PLAINTIFF I WOULD RATHER SEE MONEY TAKEN FROM THE HANDS OF THE MANY IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE MANY. I. E. FUNDS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT THEY CAN ENGAGE IN ROBUST TRAINING- ANSWERS THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS THAT I INDICATED TO IDENTIFY OFFICERS. YOU MAY BE PROBLEMATIC VERY EARLY ON SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION WHETHER THAT BE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND- TERMINATION. OR JUST TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT OFFICERS IN THE STATE OF PERSONAL TURMOIL SUCH THERE'S SOME TYPE OF INTERVENTION MIGHT BE NECESSARY. POLICE OFFICERS ARE HUMAN BEINGS AS WELL AND SOMETIMES IT MAY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY SIMPLY NEED SOME COUNSELING OR COURSE CORRECTION. SO THAT THEIR PERSONAL LIVES DO NOT PROPERLY CONVEYED UPON YOUR COMPLETION OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT WE. ALL TRUST THEM TO ENGAGE IN. SO WITHOUT I HAVE PLENTY TO SAY ON MY TIME IS LIMITED I I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. YES THIS- I WOULD- I. IF YOU WERE LIKE SOME ADDITION TIME TO. MAYBE TALK THE OTHER OF THE EQUATION. I THINK I WOULDN'T KNOW I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT ALSO TO- LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE EQUATION. HI THE EFFORTS THAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT. OFFICERS ARE NOT PLACED IN A POSITION. WHERE THEY MADE INAPPROPRIATE ACTION. I HAVE SOME IDEAS. ON THAT AS FAR. LISTEN SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER. WE YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOUR EXPERTISE- IN THIS MATTER- I THINK THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES MAYBE YOU IF YOU CAN- DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE. YOU MAY WANT TO SUBMIT THAT TO US- AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT EACH SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER GET COPIES OF THAT- AND OR YOU MAY WANT INCORPORATED IN A CAR AND IN A RESPONSE TO. I MEMBERS QUESTIONED THAT THEY MAY ASK OF YOU DURING THE Q. AND A PORTION. OF A WICKED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US IF YOU CAN STAY ON- UNTIL WE GET TO THE Q. AN ACE- PORTION- SURE MEMBERS WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU DIRECTED TOWARD. TO YOU. NEXT UP I WANT TO HAVE MISTER JEFFREY S. SHELDON- MISTER SHELDON REPRESENTS HE'S THE CHAIR OF THE- PUBLIC SAFETY PRACTICE GROUP- AND WITH VERY GRATEFUL FOR MRS SHELDON BEING WITH US. ON TODAY. SO MR SHELDON ARE YOU WITH US. I YES I WOULD YOU CAN YOU ME WE CAN HEAR YOU. VERY WELL WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN THERE YOU GO- YOU HAVE OF SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES- WE LOVE FUTURE INCORPORATE YOUR INTRODUCTION INTO THAT SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES AND WHEN YOU ARE READY. PLEASE PROCEED. I AM READY OKAY- I COME TO YOU I'M A IS AS INDICATED I'M A PARTNER WITH THE BURKE CASSIDY WHITMORE- I AM LIKE MISTER SINISTER TOUCH TONE I REPRESENT. FROM MANAGEMENT OR PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS. AND IN PARTICULAR WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- ALL RIGHT I GO AGAINST OF FOLKS LIKE MR MISDIAGNOSIS WELL- SO HE'S ON THE UNION SIDE OF THINGS AND WHAT I'M ON MANAGEMENT SIDE OF THINGS- LEADER CASSIDY THE FIRM I WORK FOR HAS BEEN REPRESENTING PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND THAT IS REALLY OUR FOCUS. AS YOU INDICATED I'M THE CHAIR OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PRACTICE GROUP I'M ALSO ONE OF THE FIRM'S LITIGATORS AND I'VE- HANDLED A LOT OF POLICE WITH ADDITION EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION IN PARTICULAR REGARDING POLICE OFFICERS. ONE HUNDRED BASIS I PROVIDED AND COUNSEL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATORS ON. A WHOLE HOST OF ASPECTS AND INVOLVING LABOR EMPLOYMENT LAW BUT IN PARTICULAR ON POLICE DISCIPLINE. MY CLIENTS ARE LARGE AND SMALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS FROM AGENCIES LIKE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. TO SMALLER AGENCIES WITH TWENTY FIFTEEN OFFICERS EVEN. SO I'LL SEE THESE ISSUES FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. ON MY INVOLVEMENT IN THESE MATTERS LIKE MUCH MR TOUCHED ON MISTER STATNY AYE I SEE THESE THINGS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND REALLY FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE. OF FROM ONE THE COMPLAINT COMES IN TO THE INVESTIGATION- TO THESE WHAT WE CALL THE SCALING PROCESS THE NOTICE OF INTENT TO DISCIPLINE A SCALY A FINAL NOTICE OF DISCIPLINE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL AND THEN THE POST APPEAL LITIGATION THAT OFTENTIMES FOLLOWS. I'M INVOLVED IN ALL OF THAT- AND CAN SPEAK TO YOU REALLY FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THAT UP. TODAY I I'VE LISTENED. THREE FINDLAY ARE THINGS FUNDS ALL DAY TODAY AND- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LOOPHOLE FORD'S. UP AT SEA SOME OF LITTLE FOR. TO ENTER I CAN OFFER YOU SOME AT LEAST OF MY EXPERIENCES IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THOSE THINGS- I'VE HEARD TODAY A LOT ABOUT DUE PROCESS. VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT- WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES- AS THE- THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IS DISCUSS THE OBSTACLES IN HOLDING POLICE ACCOUNTABLE ONE OF THE OBSTACLES IS DUE PROCESS IN ITSELF I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED ON ADD AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY THAT COMES FROM THE CONSTITUTION. OUR OFFICERS WHEN THEY COME TO WORK FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYER THEY THEY STILL ENJOY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AND THAT INCLUDES. ANYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE OR IN THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN REMOVING DUE PROCESS BUT THAT IS AN OBSTACLE- AND THAT IMPACTS THE DISCIPLINE THAT POLICE MANAGERS- IN THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE AT SOME LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S A- TIME CONSUMING. AND COSTLY PROCESS. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT THAT JUST HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED A THANK AS- A FACTOR- WHEN ANALYZING THIS QUESTION. ANOTHER OBSTACLE AS I SEE IT- OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS ARE AT SOME LEVEL ON THAT AND AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING THERE A BAD THING OR SHOULD BE DONE AWAY WITH BUT- THEY DO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS OF ATTEMPTS TO HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE- CHANGES IN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY UNIONS AND THINGS SUCH AS- YOU KNOW THERE'S A PUBLISHED CASE FOR EXAMPLE. OF DEALING WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S UNION. WHERE OF THE- APARTMENT WANTED TO CHANGE THE POLICY AND PROHIBIT OFFICERS AFTER AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING FROM HUDDLING TOGETHER WITH ONE ATTORNEY BEFORE THEY ARE ALL INTERVIEWED BY HOMICIDE INVESTIGATORS. OR INTERNAL WAS INVEST- THE UNIONS THAT. BUILT TO ME. THE END. OF. THEY DON'T SLOW DOWN THE. NUMBER OF HURDLES AND THAT MAKES SO I JUST THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME RED OF THE COMMITTEE THAT SOME OF THE OBSTACLES ARE BEING AT THAT THAT PLACE OF MENTORS- THERE'S FACE HERE ARE JUST RIGHT THAT THE THAT ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENJOY BECAUSE OF LAWS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO. ALL OF THEM NOT JUST POLICE. NOW WITH RESPECT TO POLICE- IN SOME OF THE LOOPHOLES- THAT- THAT THAT I'VE SEEN- THAT CAN IMPACT THE POLICE ADMINISTRATORS ABILITY TO TAKE DISCIPLINE OR THE OF BIGGER AND WHICH THEY DO SO- COME IN THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT- ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE- THE REMEDY PROVISION THAT'S GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THREE THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE. ONE OF THE REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE- P. O. B. R. IS SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE AND- WELL THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME WHEN THERE IS AN INTENTIONAL OR- I'M AT AN AGENCY THAT'S WITH MALICE. TO HAVE SOMEONE AN OFFICER'S ADMISSION THAT THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG THROWN OUT BECAUSE AN INVESTIGATOR MADE A MINOR MISTAKE OR NEGLIGENCE MISTAKE SEEMS DRACONIAN TO ME AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO TAKE. A LOOK AT ANOTHER ISSUE WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATUE LIMITATIONS CONTAINED IN THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF THERE IS A ONE YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS AND THAT- BELIEVE IT OR NOT SME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS CAN TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR AND SO. THAT IS ONE THING THAT YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT IT ONE YEAR IS KIND OF AN ARTIFICIAL NUMBER- AT LEAST TAKING A LOOK AT THAT IS THAT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD THERE BE MORE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ONE YEAR STATUTE LIMITATIONS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK PERHAPS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT- ANOTHER. OBSTACLE IF YOU WILL AND HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE P. O. B. R. IS THE LEVEL AND- L. DISCIPLINE IN WHICH AN OFFICER IS ENTITLED TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL. AND THESE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS THEY CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE- BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE CONSTITUTION ONLY REQUIRES AN APPEAL FOR SUSPENSION OF FIVE DAYS OR LESS. HE'LL BE AREN'T REQUIRES AN APPEAL WHEN THERE'S A WRITTEN REPRIMAND. AND BECAUSE OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE PRINCIPLES THERE'S KIND OF A DISINCENTIVE THEREFORE SOME AGENCIES THE RICHER WRITTEN REPRIMAND FOR EXAMPLE- BECAUSE- THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN APPEAL AND- I'VE HAD PERSONALLY HAVE HAD CASES WERE WRITTEN REPRIMAND HAS RESULTED IN A THREE DAY. APPEAL ON. ANOTHER POTENTIAL OF SAYING THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WITH RESPECT TO THE PO BR- IS THERE IS A CASE CALLED LABIO- AND REALLY DEALS WITH THE SUPERVISOR QUESTIONING AN EMPLOYEE BEFORE THERE'S AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION AND AGAIN THE DRACONIAN REMEDY OF SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE OF THAT IS A SURGEON THAT- I THINK SHOULD BE REVISITED AT SOME POINT BY THE LEGISLATURE. ANOTHER OF POINT IN THE POTR WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY THREE B. O. G. THERE'S A STATEMENT EARLIER ABILITY WAS BY MR STAGNATING INDICATED THAT OFFICERS DO NOT GET A RIGHT TO. THE MATERIALS OF THAT THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE AS THEY'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER- BEFORE THE BEFORE THEY'RE INTERROGATED. AND THAT ONE THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE- BUT THERE IS A PROVISION AND THE SANTA ANA- PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CASE INTERPRETED THE LAW THIS WAY THAT IF THERE IS TO BE A SECOND INTERROGATION OF THE OFFICER. I'VE BEEN THERE ARE POTENTIALLY ENTITLED TO WHATEVER THE INVESTIGATOR HAS IN THEIR RECORDS. OTHER WITNESS STATEMENTS AND EVIDENCE COLLECTED AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND THAT IS JUST. IN MY VIEW NOT A SOUND INVESTORSOBSERVER'S ON THING THAT. I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED WHEN THEY ENACTED THIRTY THREE OH THREE G. BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT AS WELL- AND- THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE IDEAS WITH RESPECT TO THE PO BR. THAT I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT. ALL OR MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. I WOULD AND LASTLY WOULD BE. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY ANGLE AS FAR AS- HELP KHOBAR PROHIBITING TRANSPARENCY IN SOME RESPECTS AND I THINK. REALLY THE STATUTES THAT REALLY FOR TWO TRANSPARENCY ARE WHAT WE CALL THE PITCHES STATUTES. OF THE PEOPLE EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN AND PARTICULAR EVIDENCE CODE SECTION TEN FORTY THREE. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT DO- REQUIRE I JUST MOTIONS TO. FOR TRANSPARENCY OF MOST RECORDS- UP UNTIL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE INTO A- THANK YOU ARE. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE IT MISTER SHELDON- IF YOU CAN JUST STAND BY- THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU FROM ALMOST SURE WE WILL AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR NEXT PANELIST. NEXT WE WILL HAVE A DEBORAH MERECE UM WHICH IS A- LAW PROFESSOR AT THE- NORTHERN EASTERN OR NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY- MISS REMEMBERS ARE YOU WITH US. YES THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR JOINING THE THIS COMMITTEE LENDING YOUR VOICE IN THIS CONVERSATION YOU HAVE UP TO SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES- PLEASE INCORPORATE IF YOU WOULD- YOUR- SARGE'S ONE.

GOING TO WOULD YOU PLEASE COME UP AND TAKE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND I APOLOGIZE MISS MORE- ROMERO'S. ARE WE'LL GET RIGHT BACK WITH YOU IN A FEW MOMENTS I'M NOT THE TABLE. CUP AT THE TABLE YES AT THE TABLE HE'S A PROPER PRESENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF YOU CAN TAKE UP TO SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES AND- INCORPORATES YOUR INTRODUCTION OF YOURSELF INTO THIS DISCUSSION WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT RECOGNIZE YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN. THIS COMMITTEE IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR RESPECT. AND ANTICIPATION THAT I TESTIFY HERE TODAY BEFORE THE SUSTAIN- COMMITTEE. AND IT IS ALSO WITH JUSTICE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOLUTION AND DETERMINATION THAT I COME TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS ALL TOO IMPORTANT TOPIC THE POLICE REFORM AND HOLDING POLICE ACCOUNTABLE. IN A WAY IN WHICH THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THAT IS JUST AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE. AND IS THIS IS AS IS AS INSIDIOUS AS A CULVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND IS JUST AS DIVISIVE AS ANY ISSUE THAT WE HAVE EVER FACED IN OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS ROOTED. IN THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN LONG HELD. DIVISIVE FOR OUR COUNTRY. ROOTED IN THINGS SUCH AS RACISM BIAS. PREJUDICE AND AFFORDING TWO SYSTEMS OF LAW WHERE POLICE OFFICERS ARE FAR TOO OFTEN NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE MUCH OF THIS IS DUE TO A PATCHWORK OF LAWS AND BENEFITS THAT POLICE OFFICERS ENJOY THAT AVERAGE CITIZENS DO NOT. SOME OF IT IS ALSO DUE IN PART TO THE CULTURE OF POLICING WHICH EMBRACES A CODE OF SILENCE WHICH TO THE PUBLIC IS TOLD AS DO NOT ENGAGE OR- PARTICIPATE IN THE WHOLE DO NOT **** BUT THAT IS THEN TRANSFERRED TO A CODE OF SILENCE. OR THE THIN BLUE LINE. OR IT'S ALSO LITTLE OF DUE TO THE PATCHWORK OF LAWS WHICH ALLOW. POLICE OFFICERS. TO ENJOY A REVOLVING DOOR OF SUCH WHERE THEY COULD AVOID DISCIPLINE TERMINATION FOR THEIR MISDEEDS AND MISCONDUCT. IT BECOME HIRED AT ANOTHER JURISDICTION WITH THE PUBLIC NOT KNOWING. ABOUT THEIR PAST MISDEEDS. I LIKE IN THAT IT CAN TO THE CATHOLIC PRIEST CATTLE WHERE. SKINNERS WHO WERE ABUSED AT ONE PARISH. HAVE A PRIEST REMOVED AND THAT PRIEST IS THEN ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THEIR ASSAULT OF AN ABUSIVE CONDUCT IN ANOTHER PARISH WITH THOSE PARISHIONERS ON BEGUN BEEN ELSE THOSE PARISHIONERS. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS A MUSTACHE. AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO HANDLE THIS HOWEVER WE MUST FOCUS ON A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RULES. REFORMS AND SOME IN THE POLITICAL WILL. M. MORAL CONVICTIONS OF THOSE WHO WE TRUST TO DO THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS PROBLEM GO AWAY. WE MUST HAVE DISTRIBUTARIES WERE WILLING TO PROSECUTE COPS WHO OFFEND THE COMMUNITIES. STANDARDS AND MORALS WHO VIOLATE THE COMMUNITY TRUST WE MUST HAVE CHIEFS WHO ARE WILLING TO ENFORCE DISCIPLINE AGAINST THOSE OFFICERS WHO VIOLATE THEIR TRAINING AND THE LAW. AND FINALLY WE MUST HAVE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS YOURSELF THAT ARE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN HAVE OPEN DISCUSSIONS AND DIALOGUE ABOUT THESE ISSUES WELCOME THE PUBLIC INPUT BUT ALSO RELY UPON THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE JUST AS COMMITTED. TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. MY NAME IS A DANTE POINTER. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA A FIFTEEN MINUTE YEAR MEMBER OF THE BAR THE UC BERKELEY GRADUATE AND A GRADUATE OF THE UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW I'M A PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER WHO HAS REPRESENTED POLICE VICTIMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THOSE CASES HAVE MADE THE HEADLINES BEFORE TOO MANY HAVE NOT. SOME OF THOSE CASES HAVE EVEN MADE IT INTO THE MOVIES BUT ONCE AGAIN MANY OF THOSE VICTIMS HAVE NOT EVEN RECEIVED A SINGLE PIECE OF PAINT IN A NEWSPAPER ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR DEATH. IN EVEN MORE WORSE IS THAT MANY OF THOSE VICTIMS OF POLICE ABUSE HAVE HAD THEIR FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO READ. THE STORIES. THE LIES IN THE MISDIRECTION OF THOSE PERSONS WHO TOOK THEIR LIFE. I ALSO STAND BEFORE YOU OBVIOUSLY AS A BLACK MAN A FATHER A BROTHER A CONCERNED CITIZEN AND A RESIDENT WHO HAS HIMSELF. BEEN ABUSED BY POLICE OFFICERS MOST RECENTLY DURING A TRAFFIC STOP THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS JUST A FEW YEARS BACK. EVEN THOUGH I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BAR. ENJOY THE PRIVILEGES AND BENEFITS OF BEING A WELL KNOWN PERSON IN MY COMMUNITY IN A DEFENDER OF THE PUBLIC JUSTICE. NONE OF THAT MATTERED WHEN I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN UNFORTUNATELY MY STORY. IS NOT ONE THAT IS UNCOMMON IN FACT IT'S FREQUENT. AND ALL I WAS LEFT WITH AFTER THE END OF THAT THE COUNTER WHERE I WAS PUSH WITHIN JUST A MILLISECOND. OF MY LIFE FACING A LIFE AND DEATH DECISION WITH SOMEONE YELLING AT ME CONFLICTING DECISIONS. WITH NO ONE TO TURN TO. ALL I WAS LEFT WITH WAS MY FEELINGS. AND THERE WAS REALLY NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IN THAT MOMENT. IN THOSE OFFICERS CONTINUE TO POLICE MY COMMUNITY. AND MAY UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUE TO INFLICT THAT SAME INJUSTICE ON OTHERS. THIS THESE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS AND TRANSGRESSIONS THAT WE MUST ROOT OUT IF WE ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO HAVING A SOCIETY THAT LIVES UP TO THE IDEALS THAT WE ALL SUBSCRIBE TO EQUALITY AND JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. IN MY PRACTICE OF BEING A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY. I HAVE DEFENDED. AND PROSECUTED- VINDICATED THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE NOT JUST IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY OF THE SAM'S CLUB AREA BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALTHOUGH IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT WE POINT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR. WE LIVE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO LOOKING AT THE SHOOTING DEATH OF GERMS SOUTHERN. THE CHURCH THE NINETY KANE WHO WAS SHELLED FOR SUPPOSEDLY TRESPASSING. YOU CAN EVEN LOOK TO THE CITY VALLEJO JUST DOWN THE ROAD. WHICH HAS ENJOYED NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR THE HIGHEST RATE OF THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. BY A SMALL GROUP OF OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN DUBBED THE FATAL FOURTEEN. BADGE BENDING AND CELEBRATING THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PAYING MULTI MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT SQUANDERING AWAY THE TAX MONEY IN THE BUDGETS OF THAT CITY. YOU CAN EVEN LEAD TO SAN FRANCISCO. I UNDERSTAND BEFORE ME MISTER PAUL HENDERSON TESTIFIED WHO IS THE CHAIR THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. PRIOR TO HAVE TAKEN OFFICE. SAN FRANCISCO WAS FRANKLY OUT OF CONTROL WE HAVE THE SHOOTING DEATH OF MARIO WOODS WHICH SPARKED THE KNEELING OF CALLING CAPPER NICK GOT GORE PAT WHO WAS ALSO KILLED IN WHOSE OFFICER ESCAPED ANY DISCIPLINE. BY RESIGNING BEFORE TO SAY TRANSFERRING BEFORE ANY DISCIPLINE WAS IMPOSED AGAINST HIM TO THE CITY OF ANTIOCH. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF EXAMPLES OF INJUSTICE THAT WE WHO STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE ADDRESSES CANNOT STAND SILENT OR SIT ON OUR HANDS. I AM HOPEFUL YET STILL THAT THIS CHAMBER. THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT ALL THE MEMBERS WHO CLEAR WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE A FRIEND OF PEACE A FRIEND OF JUSTICE. AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMUNITY. WELL ONCE AGAIN DO THE BACK BREAKING WORK OF FORCING OUR POLICING TO BE. MODERNIZED CONSTITUTIONAL. IT UP HOLD THE LAW FOR EVERYONE THAT IT SHOULD. IT SHOULD HAVE THAT POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY WE ALSO STRIVE IN A BY TWO WHETHER YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE STAINED BODY WHETHER YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE STATE BAR WITH YOUR DOCTOR TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OR REST OF ONE OWNER WHO SUBJECTS THE MANDATES OF THE STATE AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER CALIFORNIA IS A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY IN EQUITY BUT WE MUST LIVE UP TO THAT. ENDEAVOR TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE WORK THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS I'M GONNA TOUCH ON VERY BRIEFLY THAT I THINK WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING US REALIZE THE DREAM. ONE OF WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE LAWSUIT ACTUALLY- WE'RE ALLOWED TO USE TO ENFORCE. THE JUSTICE AND THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS ONE OF WHICH IS THE BANE ACT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BODY HAS LOOKED AT AND WORKED AND THERE'S BEEN PROPOSALS AS IT RELATES TO HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE PAIN ACT AS YOU ALL KNOW THE BAN ACT IS CALIFORNIANS EQUIVALENT TO THE FEDERAL LAW. THE FORTY TWO USC NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF AS AN ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT PEOPLE TO GET THEM JUSTICE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY THE POLICE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE BAND ACTORS BEEN WEAKENED BY WAY OF JUDICIAL CREATION OF DIFFERENT RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE NOT EVEN INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION. THERE HAVE BEEN LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO PERSIST. THAT PREVENT THE BANNACK FROM APPLYING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY WAY OF BEING MALICIOUSLY PROSECUTED PERJURIOUS TESTIMONY. OR INJURED WHILE THEY ARE IN THE CUSTODY. OF JAILERS. YOUR SUPPORT OF YOUR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS WELL AS THE BANNACK STRETCHING THE VANECK TO MAKE SURE THAT IT LIVES UP TO THE TRUTH IN THE PROMISE OF ITS ORIGINAL. DRAFTERS AND CREATORS IT'S ALSO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION. THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BASHING THE CRADLE OF DATA COLLECTION. AND TECH AND WE DO NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE BUSINESS IN THE PUBLIC'S NAME. IN MAKING LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS THEY JUST MAKES NO SENSE. IN FACT WE TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THAT AND WE MUST HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS ENFORCED THAT IS OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. AND COMPREHENSIVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF FIVE STATES DOES NOT HAVE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. FINALLY AS A RELEASED OFFICER WRITES THE WAY IN WHICH THESE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS OR- ARE INVESTIGATED THERE MUST BE INDEPENDENT REVIEW. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE INDEPENDENT REVIEW WE CANNOT HAVE POLL WORKERS STANDING IN JUDGMENT OF OTHER COWORKERS WHEN IS LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS AND CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT. I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME I STAND READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE PANEL FOR THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE AND ADDRESSES. THANK YOU REMEMBER SUPPORTER FOR YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE THIS BODY TODAY AND PRESHEAF YOUR WORK- AND IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND WE MAY HAVE SOME OF SIR WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- DIRECTED TO YOU. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID DEBORAH MERECE. YES THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING PATIENT OF THE LAW PROFESSOR AT NORTH EAST UNIVERSITY THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN- YEAH FIVE SIX TO EIGHT MINUTES SO- PLEASE INCORPORATE YOUR INTRODUCTION WITH IN THAT TIME AND YOU ARE. UP TO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME DURING THESE IMPORTANT HEARINGS- MY NAME IS DEBORAH ROMERO S. AND I'M A PROFESSOR AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW HERE IN BOSTON. SOME OF THE TITLE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS WHY IS IT SO HARD TO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE FOR RISKY BEHAVIOR. FIRST OFF I WANT TO CHECK SOUND CAN PEOPLE HEAR ME WE CAN YOU GO AND SEE YOU YES. PERFECT THANK YOU I'M- WHEN I TALK TO MY STUDENTS I SAY THAT THE ANSWER IS AN ANSWER THAT'S BEEN GIVEN ALREADY TODAY WHICH IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY. RIGHT NOW TO WEED OUT THE BAD OFFICERS SO THAT THE GOOD OFFICERS CAN THRIVE. SOME COUNTRIES SOME OF THE SPEAKERS MY EXPERIENCE THE EMPIRICAL DATA AND ALL THE STUDIES INDICATE THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO LAY OFF OR FIRE A POLICE OFFICER BECAUSE OF UNION PROTECTIONS. AND THERE'S ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S THAT EVEN WHEN. YOU OR I OR SOMEONE INJURED BY THE POLICE USES THE COURT SYSTEM AND FILES A LAWSUIT. THE OFFICER- DOES NOT BEAR THE COSTS OF ANY DAMAGES ASSESSED NOW I WANT EXPLAINED THAT FOR A MINUTE. THE COURTS AND MUNICIPALITIES HOLD OFFICERS LIABLE FOR MISCONDUCT. EITHER BY SETTLEMENT OR BY VERDICT. NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THAT AS A RESULT THE OFFICERS WOULD PAY DAMAGES TO THE VICTIMS WHO THEY INJURED. BUT IN FACT THE OFFICERS PAY NOT ONE PENNY WHEN YOU ARE I ARE SUED FOR NEGLIGENCE- WE HAVE TO PAY THE DAMAGES BUT THEY DO NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH THE MUNICIPALITIES. SO THAT THE MUNICIPALITIES PAY MISCONDUCT. FINALLY I THINK ONE REASON THAT WE'VE HAD SO MUCH DIFFICULTY HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE IS THIS. WE FOCUS A LOT OF OUR ATTENTION. ON RESPONDING TO SHOOTINGS RESPONDING TO INJURIES RESPONDING TO A CUTE RECKLESS ACTS OF POLICING. BUT WE ARE MUCH LESS FOCUSED. I'M PREVENTING THESE ACTS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BY INTERVENING AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE SO MY PRESENTATION IF YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ONE WORD IS PREVENTION. HOW DO WE PREVENT THE VIDEOS THAT ALL OF US HAVE SEEN. FROM RECURRING. WHEN I TALKED TO POLICE CHIEFS ABOUT THIS ISSUE HERE'S WHAT THEY TELL ME. THEY SAY. DEBBIE I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE THE POLICE UNIONS ARE IN CHARGE. THEY SAY I CAN'T HIRE THE OFFICERS. I CAN'T PROMOTE THEM I CAN'T DISCIPLINE THEM AND I CAN'T FIRE THEM. SO I STOPPED PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND THEY SAID WE CAN'T HIRE. THE PEOPLE WE THINK WOULD BE GUARDIANS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND PROBLEM SOLVERS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HIRE THE PERSON WHO GOT THE HIGHEST CIVIL SERVICE EXAM TEST SCORE. WE CAN'T PROMOTE. THE PEOPLE WHO DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF COMMUNITY POLICING. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HIRE THE PERSON WHO GOT THE HIGHEST TEST ON THE CIVIL SERVICE EXAM. AND WE CANNOT DISCIPLINE THE OFFICERS WHO WE SEE WITH DRUG PROBLEMS ALCOHOL PROBLEMS ANGER MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS PEOPLE ENGAGING IN RISKY BEHAVIOR PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING SOMEONE IN A BAR OR RESTITUTA BEING AND CONVICTED OF IT WE CAN'T DISCIPLINE THEM. BECAUSE OF THE LABOR ARBITRATION SYSTEM. WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME. THEIR DECISION TO DISCIPLINE IS OVERTURNED. BY THE LABOR ARBITRATORS AND THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM CONTROLLED BY THE POLICE UNIONS AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS THEY ALSO CAN'T FIRE A POLICE OFFICER. NOW WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU TODAY. ONE QUOTE CAME TO MIND. IT'S SHORT IT SAYS WE CAN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS. BY USING THE SAME KIND OF THINKING WE USED WHEN WE CREATED THEM. WE NEED NEW IDEAS WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY TO DEVELOP A RISK ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS. WHY CAN'T WE INSURE POLICE OFFICERS LIKE OTHER PROFESSIONALS AND REQUIRE THEM TO KERRY MANDATORY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. NOW MY NEIGHBOR IS A DOCTOR AND HE SAID HE HAS TO CARRY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE AND HE SAID IF I STARTED DRINKING OR USING DRUGS OPERATING ON THE WRONG LEG OR ARM MY INSURANCE PREMIUMS WOULD GO UP AND IF I CONTINUED TO DO THAT THEY DON'T WANT MORE AND I BE PRICED OUT OF MEDICINE. HE SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY POLICE OFFICERS. WITH DANGEROUS HISTORIES AND INDICATORS ARE PRICED OUT OF POLICING THE SAME WAY. BY PREMIUMS THAT REFLECT THE ACTUAL RISK OF THEIR DANGEROUS POLICING. THE SYSTEM THAT I ENVISION WOULD BE A PREVENTION SYSTEM EARLY ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THROUGH RISK ASSESSMENT SCORE CARDS WOULD IDENTIFY OFFICERS ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIOR. AND THEY WOULD SAY LOOK. YOU WERE JUST CONVICTED OF ASSAULTING SOMEONE AND BARK YOU WERE JUST CONVICTED OF DRUNK DRIVING YOU HAVE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER YOU CAN EITHER GET TREATMENT AND TRAINING. FOR YOUR PREMIUMS WILL GO UP IF YOU GET TREATMENT OR TRAINING YOUR PREMIUMS GO DOWN. IN THIS WAY WE WOULD CREATE AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THAT DEALT WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES EARLIER. HOW WOULD IT WORK. WELL AN OFFICER WOULD HAVE TO CARRY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN BECAUSE THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD MANDATE. THAT IN ORDER TO POLICE IN CALIFORNIA EVERY OFFICER MUST KERRY. PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD PAY THE AVERAGE BASE PREMIUM FOR ALL OFFICERS SO WOULD COST THE OFFICERS NOTHING BUT ANY INCREASES DUE TO RISKY BEHAVIOR ARE PAID BY THE OFFICER. AND THE MUNICIPALITIES WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PAYING FOR THE COST OF POLICE MISCONDUCT THAT WOULD BE PAID BY THE OFFICER AND THEIR INSURANCE POLICY. WHAT DO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DO HERE. THEY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST THEY ASSESS RISK. THEY CREATE RISK ASSESSMENT SCORECARDS FOR THE OFFICERS. AND FIND OUT AND IDENTIFY WHAT EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS WHO ARE THE BAD APPLES. THEY ARE AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY THEY ASSIST RISK IN OTHER AREAS THEY PRICE OUT BAD DRIVERS THEY PRICE OUT BAD LAWYERS THEY PRICE OUT BAD DOCTORS WERE ASKING THEM TO PRICE OUT BAD POLICE OFFICERS. NOW IF THIS SYSTEM HAD BEEN IN PLACE. LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED. AN OFFICER LIKE DANIEL PANTALEO WHO STRANGLED ERIC GARDNER IN NEW YORK. WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS AMONG THE TOP 2% OF NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS WITH THE MOST SUSTAINED CIVILIAN COMPLAINTS. WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING TO PRIOR LAWSUITS AND SETTLEMENTS AND ONE PRIOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRICED OUT OF POLICING BEFORE HE MET ERIC GARNER. THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF DEREK SHOPPING- STRANGLED GEORGE FLOOR. SO WHAT ARE WE ASKING YOU THE LEGISLATORS TO DO THREE SIX. THANK. ONE LIMIT THE SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR POLICE UNIONS AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY PROHIBIT THEM FROM BARGAINING ABOUT HIRING DISCIPLINE TERMINATION AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE COST OF POLICE MISCONDUCT NARROW THE SCOPE YOU CAN DO THAT AND AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WE SHOULD. TO PROHIBIT ALL MUNICIPALITIES IN CALIFORNIA FROM CONTINUING TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PAY 1100% OF THE COST FOR POLICE MISCONDUCT SUIT AND BY THE WAY FOR THE LEGAL COSTS FOR THE LAWYERS WHO ARE TESTIFYING TODAY. THREE REQUIRE POLICE TO CARRY MNDATORY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY% INSURANCE LIKE OTHER PROFESSIONALS AND STATE THAT THEY MAY NOT POLICING CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THE INSURANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A PROFESSOR EMERITUS WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND NOW AT THIS POINT OF OUR AGENDA- WE WANT TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS SO I WOULD ASK MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY AND OR VIRTUALLY TO I SEE MISTER MAYES WILL GO TO YOU FIRST- PLEASE TEXT ME SO I CAN PLACE YOU IN THE QUEUE. SO ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE TEXT ME SO WE CAN RECOGNIZE YOU- AND IT WILL GO FROM THERE FIRST UP WE HAVE MISTER CHAD MAYES- WHO WHO HAS A QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL GO TO JUST A LACK IN THE MISTER MCCARTY. I CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY FOR SOME REASON MY VIDEOS NOT COMING ON HERE BUT- I'M FASCINATED- BY MR MAYOR IS A BY YOUR OF YOUR PRESENTATION. ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATES- ARE THERE ANY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THIS SAME A SORT OF SYSTEM OR IS THIS A NOVEL OF CONCEPT. MISTER MERISTEMS YOUR QUESTION. IT IS IT IS A NOVEL A NEW IDEA BUT SINCE WE STARTED WRITING ABOUT THIS- SEVERAL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED FIRST ON COLORADO THEY ACTUALLY PASS STATE LEGISLATION. THAT MADE IT SO THAT THE OFFICER HAD TO PAY THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF DAMAGES PERSONALLY. MISSED A PENALTY WOULD ONLY PICK UP THE DAMAGES OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT MEANT THAT THE UNIONS CAME TO US AND SAID WE WANT TO PROFESSIONAL I ABILITY INSURANCE TO INSURANCE WITH ITS NEW PERSONAL LIABILITY THAT WE HAVE. SO IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT TWO OFFICERS BECAUSE THE STATE LEGISLATURE SAD WE ARE TIRED OF TAXPAYERS PAYING ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THE COST OF POLICE MISCONDUCT BECAUSE IT COMES OUT OF THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET THAT MEANS WE HAVE LESS FOR SCHOOLS AND AS YOU KNOW DURING A PANDEMIC AND DURING THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS WE'RE GONNA FACE WE CAN NO LONGER PAY THAT BILL- IN THESE AS YOU KNOW THESE SUITS CAN BE TWENTY MILLION. FIVE MILLION FOUR MILLION THESE ARE HUGE SUITS THAT COME OUT OF NOWHERE SO- THAT'S ONE STATE THAT HAS ACTUALLY PASSED IT THEN I'VE BEEN TALKING TO- SENATOR BRG AND NEW YORK AND SHE HAS FILED LEGISLATION. ASKING THAT EVERY POLICE OFFICER IN NEW YORK BE REQUIRED TO CARRY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. AND THIRD. IT'S NOVEL TO APPLY IT TO POLICE BUT AS YOU KNOW AS DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL IS ALREADY IN PLACE IF YOU STARTED DRUNK DRIVING TWO OR THREE TIMES YOUR PREMIUMS WOULD GO UP. AND EVENTUALLY YOU'D BE PRICED OUT OF DRIVING. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS WHETHER YOU ARE A PSYCHIATRIST A PSYCHOLOGIST- EIGHT LAWYER OR DOCTOR MOST PROFESSIONALS DO CARRY PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. IT HAS OPERATED EFFECTIVELY AND HAS OPERATED IN NUMEROUS ARENAS. WELL I AM FASCINATED- BY IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE LISTENING- IF YOU'VE GOT. IF YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE- OR YOUR OPPOSED OR YOU ALSO THINK THAT IT IS A AN INTERESTING IDEA I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND TO HEAR FROM YOU AND- MISTER CHAIR BE GREAT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO GO TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CURRENT CUNNINGHAM. IT SURE MY QUESTION IS FOR MR MARISS WALL- IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. THIS WOULD BE IT'S A NOVEL IDEA I THINK IT'S AN INTRIGUING AND I THINK ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT. ON A POLICY LEVEL CHANGING THE- LIABILITY STANDARDS IN ANY WAY IT MAY EVEN BE A NECESSITY THAT WE NEED TO MOVE POLICE OFFICERS TO AN INSURANCE. BASED MODEL OR EVEN REQUIRE IT- OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYBODY WILLING TO JOIN THE PROFESSION I MEAN THAT'S YEAH ARE VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE WILLING TO JOIN THE PROFESSION. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT UNLIMITED LIABILITY AND SOMETIMES MULTIMILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENTS- WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ASSETS OR RESOURCES TO PAY THOSE THAT'S NOT A VERY VERY GOOD THING- MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES ABOUT. HOW THIS INSURANCE MARKET WOULD WORK- AND WHETHER INSURANCE CARRIERS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND- WRITING THOSE KINDS OF POLICIES AND WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH ACTUARIAL DATA OR WHATEVER DATA THEY NEED TO PROPERLY. ASSESS AND PRICE AND RISK GIVEN THIS IS KIND OF A NOVEL. CONCEPT IN THE YOU KNOW I'M AN ATTORNEY IN OUR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE IS PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT FORMULAS FOR HOW MANY YEARS YOU PRACTICE TO WHAT KIND OF AREAS OF LAW YOU PRACTICE AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU DO FAMILY LAW IT'S ONE THING IF YOU DO THE STATE'S ENTRUSTS VERY VERY. EXPENSIVE IF YOU DO CRIMINAL DEFENSE IRONICALLY IT'S VERY CHEAP- BUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT BODY OF DATA- HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS PROFESSOR AS TO WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE- ON ON HOW THIS SORT OF NOVEL INSURANCE MARKET WOULD WORK BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A VERY INTRIGUING IDEA. I WENT INTO LAW REVIEW I. THAT GO THROUGH THE DATA WORKING WITH INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS TO SET IT IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY LUCRATIVE MODEL MODEL. IT'S VERY LUCRATIVE FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES- I'VE BEEN ADVISING STATES IS THAT MAYBE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN BE INVOLVED. IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT SCORECARDS BUT MAYBE THE STATE COULD DO SOME OF THE POOLING OF RESOURCES. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THIS. IT ALL OF THESE POLICE DEPARTMENTS. ARE GOING TO BE PAYING THE BASE PREMIUM. COULD THAT ALL GO INTO A POOL THAT THE STATE INSURANCE COMPANY. SUPERVISES SO THEY COULD GIVE REBATES TO THE- DEPARTMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT AND HAVEN'T HAD ANY CLAIMS- AS OPPOSED TO THE INSURANCE MARKET THAT EXISTS WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES. MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON THESE PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE. POLICIES BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TO CARRY THEM. AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT HOW NOT TO PAY OUT. WHICH IS ONE REASON IT'S A GOOD MODEL THEY THEN BECOME THE WATCHDOG. THEY DON'T WANT A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR VERDICT BECAUSE IF THEY GET IT THEY PAID. SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY VERY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHO ARE THE OFFICERS ON THIS ROAD. AND STOPPING THEM BEFORE. SHOOTING A STRANGLING OR AN INCIDENT- IN TERMS OF THE INDICATORS. THERE'S A WHOLE WEALTH OF DATA ON WHAT THEY CALL EARLY WARNING INDICATORS OF MISCONDUCT. SOME OF THEM ARE THE FACT THAT MANY POLICE OFFICERS HAVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AND THERE'S DEFINITELY EMPIRICAL DATA. THAT ONCE THAT HAPPENS THERE'S AN ANGER MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. NOW WHAT SHOULD WE DO. WHAT WE DO NOW. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I DON'T CARE HOW LONG OR HOW MANY RESTRAINING ORDERS TO GET NOTHING HAPPENS. WHAT WOULD I LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAY LOOK- YOU HAVE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. THERE'S. CLEARLY ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES HERE- WOULD YOU CONSIDER HAVING ANGER MANAGEMENT TREATMENT IN AN EMPIRICALLY SOUND PROGRAM IF THEY SAY YES MAYBE WE CAN DEAL WITH IT IN THAT WAY WITHOUT IT ESCALATING OR CASCADING AND WITHOUT PRICING THE OFFICER OUT OF POLICING WHAT'S ANOTHER INDICATOR NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS MANY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE YOU SEEN IN THOSE VIDEOS HAVE HAD MULTIPLE SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS WHAT DID WE DO. WHEN JASON VAN **** THE CITY CHICAGO PAID FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES BEFORE HE SHOT THE QUAN MCDONALD WHAT DID WE DO. NOTHING WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. SOME COUNSELING LOOK YOU JUST THE CITY CHICAGO JUST PAID FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE YOU NEED. MAYBE YOU NEED TO BE PRICED OUT BECAUSE I THINK AT THAT POINT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PATIENTS MIGHT BE VERY LOW- HE ALSO HAD A JURY AWARD 430-050-0004 EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IN A TRAFFIC STOP- THOSE ARE THE- INDICATORS THERE'S THE NUMBER OF CIVIL COMPLAINTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE PONTA LAYO WHO- CHOKED ERIC GARNER WAS IN THE TOP. 2% OF NEW YORK CITY OFFICERS FOR SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS WHAT DID WE DO. NOTHING AND AFTER HE STRANGLED ERIC GARNER TO DEATH ONE OF THE SYSTEM DO PUT HIM ON THE PAYROLL FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE HE WAS FIRED. THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW. WE COULD DO BETTER WE'VE DONE IT IN EVERY OTHER PROFESSIONAL ARENA. WE CAN SET UP CARROTS AND STICKS. I WAS THE ONE THING AND I DON'T WANT TO MONOPOLIZE THE CONVERSATION BUT I'VE GOT A LOT OF EMAILS FROM OFFICERS IN HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID THIS WAS SURPRISING TO ME CHICAGO POLICE OFFICERS SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM. WE ALL KNOW- THE OFFICERS ARE WHO ARE DRINKING WHO HAD DRUG PROBLEMS WHO'VE GOT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WHO ALREADY HAD JUDGMENTS AND WE SIT AND WE WATCH AND WE DO NOTHING AND WE THINK THAT'S LOYAL. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM. IS THAT YOU RECOGNIZE. A LOT OF THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS IS POLICE TRAUMA. WE ASK THEM TO GO WHERE WE WOULD NOT GO. AND DO WHAT WE WOULD NOT DO AND WHEN THEIR TRAUMATIC TRAUMATIZING HAVE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS WE WATCH THEM DRINK. WE WATCH THEM TAKE DRUGS WE WATCH THEM LASH OUT AT THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR PARTNERS AND WE DO NOTHING HE SAID WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM IS THAT YOU START WITH CARROTS AND GIVING TREATMENT. YOU GIVE THE PERSON A CHANCE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID AND IF THEY REFUSE THE CHANCE. THEM WITH DIGNITY BY SAYING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. AND WE WANT TO HELP YOU. TREATMENT FOR IT SO THE SYSTEM IS NOT JUST A PUNITIVE AFTER A HORRIBLE EVENT OCCURS SYSTEM IT IS A CALIBRATED SYSTEM. WELL I WOULD ALSO ADD WHEN I ALSO LIKE ABOUT THE CONCEPT IS THAT YOU'RE SHIFTING THE COST FOR MISCONDUCT- TO PRIVATE THE PRIVATE MARKET AS OPPOSED TO SHIFTING IT TO THE TAXPAYER WHICH IS WHERE IT'S PREDOMINATELY LIES NOW I'D BE INTERESTED IN READING YOUR LAW REVIEW ARTICLES IF YOU COULD MAYBE MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR. WE WILL DEFINITELY SEND BOTH OF THEM TO THE COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE DONE FINANCIAL MODELS THAT SHOW THAT THIS MODEL SURPRISE AND THIS ISN'T THE REASON WE DID IT BUT IT SAVES A LOT OF MONEY TO THE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE WITH AN INSURANCE SYSTEM YOU CAN PUT A CAP ON DAMAGES SO NO LONGER CAN SOMEONE GET TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. THEY MIGHT BE CAPPED AT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IN NEW YORK COMPENSATED WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M VERY SURPRISED INSURANCE COMPANIES MANAGE TO MAKE MONEY. THIS IS AMAZING WHO KNEW. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM- WE WANT TO MOVE AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I HEARD. INDICATORS INDICATORS FROM THE PROFESSOR INDICATORS AND THESE CAN BE EARLY INDICATORS TO SECOND TO SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE THAT SOMEONE IS IN NEED OF HELP AND SO I WANT TO GO TO MY COLLEAGUE AYE MR LACKEY THEY MISSED MCCARTY AND THEN WILL GO TO- ASSEMBLY WOMAN ELOISE HAIR. ELOISE RADIUS. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I- I WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT I REALLY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I HAVE A COMMENT WITH. REGARD TO MISS REMEMBERS IS A PROPOSAL THAT OFFICERS CARRY LIABILITY INSURANCE. AND SHE USED THE COMPARISON. COMPARING LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE PHYSICIANS. AND THE- WHAT DOCTORS THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO CARRY LIABILITY INSURANCE THEY'RE NOT GETTING SHOT AT THEY'RE NOT GETTING STABBED RUN OVER KILLED BY THEIR PATIENTS. FIND AN INSURANCE CARRIER WHO WILL ENSURE SOMEBODY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO ENGAGE IN HIGH SPEED CHASES USE FORCE TO ARREST VIOLENT. OFFENDERS WELL THIS IS WHERE ALL CARRIERS DROP PUBLIC ENTITIES YEARS AGO WHO NOW RELY ON GPAS TO PULL THE RESOURCES FOR COVERAGE. DOCTORS GET TO PICK THEIR CLIENTS POPS DON'T. DOCTORS ARE AFFORDED HOURS DAYS AND EVEN WEEKS TO MAKE THEIR PROFESSIONAL DECISIONS POPS UP TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS IN SPLIT SECONDS AND I THINK IT'S AN UNFAIR COMPARISON AND I THINK IT'S ILLOGICAL AND UNFAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LACKEY WILL GO TO MISTER MCCARTY AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO- MISTER MUST ACNE WHO HAS A QUESTION SO RIGHT AFTER MR MCCARTY THEN WE GO TO THE DAVINA STACKING. MISS MCCARTY THANK YOU AB I FIRST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE INSURANCE ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY INTRIGUING ISSUE AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE GETTING. THE FOR CONFUSED ON THAT APPLICATION OF IT BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE INSURANCE WOULD BE FOR THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE. YOU HAD IN COLORADO SO THE OFFICER WOULD ONLY BE ENSURING THAT NOT THE POTENTIAL TEN MILLION DOLLAR. WRONGFUL DEATH SETTLEMENT LIKE WE SEE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AFTER STEPHON CLARK WHAT HAVE YOU IS JUST THE FIRST BIT- SO I DON'T THINK THAT IS THAT AND REASONABLE I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE THAT MUCH EXPOSURE WHERE. WE'RE CITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO FOR THAT PREMIUM BECAUSE AGAIN THEIR PHONE. FIRST PIECE TO THE OFFICER THE SECOND PIECE WHAT WOULD GO. THROUGH LIFE FOR EXPOSURE FOR THE CITY WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND POINT THAT I KNOW. PROFESSOR CHEMERINSKY- HAD TO LEAVE AND DURING HIS. HIS PRESENT WAS TALKING ABOUT DISCIPLINE BUT HE I'M I'M SURE HE WANTED TO BE ON THE LITIGATION SIDE BUT HE HAD TO GO BUT HE WAS WEAVING IN. A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT- EXPOSURE ESSENTIALLY. I'VE HEARD AND SAY THIS BEFORE AND I KNOW MISTER-GIPSON SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD KNOW THIS. WHEN WE'RE IN CLOSED SESSION MANY TIMES WE TALK ABOUT LAWSUITS. EXCESSIVE FORCE YOU KNOW SOMEONE TRIPPING IN THE OLD SACRAMENTO- YOU KNOW LOCHSIDE WALKEN'S THAT SETTLING FOR BROKEN ANKLE BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY OF COURSE. AND YOU KNOW IN IN IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO LAST YEAR I THINK THAT- IT WAS THE NORTH NORTH OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN. INS AND PAYOUTS FOR. EXCESSIVE FORCE WRONGFUL DEATH WHICH WHICH BY THE WAY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE PUBLIC AND MORE TRANSPARENT AS FAR AS HOW MUCH CITIES ARE PAYING AS WE SAID EARLIER. THOSE MONIES CAN BE GO DO ANOTHER BUNCH OTHER THINGS INCLUDING PREVENTION AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OFFICERS IN TRAINING IN THE FIRST PLACE- BUT THE NOTION THAT THAT THAT DEAN- CHAMBER AND SKI PUTS FORWARD OVER AND OVER. HEADER HEARINGS IS THAT- A MORE A CIVIL EXPOSURE WOULD LEAD TO MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AMONG POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND I DON'T DISAGREE AND I THINK THAT LUCK. IF I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL. AND OUR BUDGET FOR WRONGFUL DEATH EXCESSIVE FORCE DOUBLED ONE YEAR FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY MILLION. YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL THE MAYOR WOULD BRING IN THE POLICE CHIEF. AND EVERYBODY IN THAT AND THE DEPARTMENT AND FOCUSING ON. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESULTS IN MAKING SURE THAT THE OFFICERS ACTIONS ARE REFLECTIVE OF OUR POLICIES BECAUSE- YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE MONEY AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE INCENTIVE OF THAT SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HE'S HE'S OFF ON THAT ISSUE. WHICH WHICH LEADS TO THE ISSUE OF THIS THAT THIS THE BANE ACT- AND I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. LOCKED IN AND AS FAR AS- DECERTIFICATION AND THE BANE ACT AND QUALIFIED IMMUNITY ISSUE. ON ONE ON ONE BILL. BUT BUT THE NOTION THERE I DON'T THINK IT IS A BAD ONE AND I'M PORAC AND OTHERS. SAY THAT IT WOULD CAUSE. OFFICERS TO LOSE THEIR HOMES AND EXPOSURE. AND IT WOULD IT WOULD YOU KNOW IF. WE WOULD HAVE ANYBODY APPLYING FOR THE JOB ANYMORE IF IT WAS FOCUSED ON THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS. LIKE A REASONABLE CAP I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD IDEA HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEN. ON TOP OF THAT HIS EXPOSURE TO THE JURISDICTION SO YOU KNOW THERE IS NOT MORE INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY FOR. FOR NECESSARILY OFFICER UNLESS THEY'RE COMMITTING A CRIME AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. DOING SOMETHING THAT'S WAY OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE- BUT BUT HAVING OVERALL- MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND EXPOSURE FOR THE JURISDICTION I THINK YOU'VE I THINK THAT WE BRING ABOUT. MUCH MUCH MORE REFORM SO- I'M NOT SURE MAYBE MUST RESPOND TO THAT BUT- BUT CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THOSE I THINK. ARE ARE ARE WERE THE ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO LET ME GO TO- MISTER SMITH- DOES ANYONE NEED A POUND ONE TO RESPOND TO THAT. QUESTION FOR MISS MCCARTY. OKAY WE HAVE A MISTER POINTER. ONE MOMENT YOU'RE MOVING THIS COULD YOU MICROPHONE ON. OKAY LET'S TRY IT OUT FRANKLY I THINK IS LUDICROUS AS OUR LAST ARGUMENT THAT- POLICE OFFICERS WOULD NOT SIGN UP FOR THE JOB OR THAT THEY'LL LOSE THEIR HOMES AS IT RELATES TO CIVIL LITIGATION I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF CASES. HAVE RECEIVED AND I HAVE BEEN A PART OF LITIGATION WHERE JURIES OF BRANDED MULTI MILLION DOLLAR VERDICTS POLICE OFFICERS HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK THOSE OFFICERS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PROMOTED. SO THE IDEA THAT IF WE WANT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BY WAY OF CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATION IS GOING TO LEAD TO IS NOT HAVING POLICE OFFICERS DISCOURAGING POLICE OFFICERS IS NOT BORNE OUT BY THE EVIDENCE AND BY MY EXPERIENCE ON TOP OF THE FACT WHAT I DO BELIEVE THE HOWEVER IS THAT. SIMILAR JUST LIKE EVERYDAY CITIZENS. WE'RE HITTING OUR PA. WE TEND TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR. OKAY IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THE MUNICIPALITIES WHETHER THAT'S THE POLICE CHIEF WHETHER THAT'S THE MAYOR WHEN THEY FILL IN THE BUDGET. THANKS TEND TO SHIFT AND WE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT HAPPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND FRANKLY THAT'S WOODS WERE ON THE VERGE OF SEEING HOPEFULLY HAPPEN IN THE CITY OF ALEPPO. SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE- INCENTIVE TO HAVE OFFICERS CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH ALONE THERE MUST BE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION THE CALENDAR WITH A GO WITH THE- THANK YOU. ADMINISTRATOR I'M SORRY ONE MORE QUESTION I'M SURE GOING TO ASK THAT THE- GENTLEMAN SO RIGHTS ATTORNEY. FROM POINTER IN. WELL NOT YES YOU MENTIONED THE CITY OF VALLEJO AND- THAT- THAT DEPARTMENT IS A MASS A RACK THAT THE LOCAL DA HAS PUBLICLY SAID SO. ASKING FOR REFORM- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STARTED ANY AN INVESTIGATION ON THEIR- BASICALLY THE CALIFORNIA VERSION OF THEIR PATTERN AND PRACTICE IS THERE. AND ONE THING THAT THAT'S KINDA LOST UPON ME IS THAT. HIGH PROFILE SHOOTING THEY HAD THEIR WITH THE OFFICER. IN THE BACK AND THAT KIND OF BANGLES THAT TO ROPE PICKUP TRUCK JUDGING THE ASSAULT RIFLE THROUGH THE BACKSEAT. AND THE OFFICERS- WENT AND THREW AWAY THE WINDSHIELD AND THE EVIDENCE WERE UNABLE TO DO THAT. SO ONE THING THAT TIME TO KIND OF DUMP BOUNCE ME AND- I KNOW SOME CITIES DO IT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEY JUST HAD A RECENT SHOOTING IN WEST SACRAMENTO AND WEST SAC HAS A POLICY THAT SAYS THAT CHRIS EVERT I Y. S. INCIDENTS. THEY WILL HAVE AN ADJACENT JURISDICTION BE THE LEAD. SO THEY I THINK IS DAVIS OR CITIES THAT COMES IN SO IT'S NOT LIKE. A WET SACK PEOPLE AREN'T. THERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST WHEN. POLICE THEM. AND SO HAVING. ANOTHER OUTSIDE JURISDICTION GRANTED SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE STILL PLACE THEIR FROM TWENTY MILES OVER BUT- IT'S A LITTLE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND I WOULD THINK TRUST IF YOU HAVE ANY ADJACENT AGENCY. DOING THAT. VALLEJO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE THAT. I THINK THAT'S A FLY ON THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE SYSTEM WE SHOULD BE JUST THAT. BUT DO YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THAT WORKS IN THAT BRINGS ABOUT MORE. TRUSTING THE PROCESS. SURE- AND I AND I AND I PRESUME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS THEMSELVES RIGHT SO- IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE- THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY ACTUALLY INVESTIGATES OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND ANY COMPLAINTS THAT ARE FILED OUT OF THE OFFICERS. ACTED ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE OR BE USING THEIR AUTHORITY THAT IS INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT IS NOT THAT A CIVILIAN LED AND IS NOT- THE GOVERNOR IF YOU WILL BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ITSELF NOW IT'S STILL WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS BUT IT'S AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION AND PROP MOST IMPORTANTLY. THEIR INVESTIGATION BEGINS AT THE SAME TIME SO THEY'RE NOT RUBBER STAMPING ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION. ESSENTIALLY THE FOUNDATION IS MADE RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT AND THEY'RE A PART OF IT VERSES. REVIEWING AN INVESTIGATION WHEN OFFICERS OF ALREADY BEEN COUNSELED FOR THEY'VE ALREADY GIVEN STATEMENTS AND YOU'RE REALLY JUST SIFTING THROUGH WHAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS ALREADY DONE THE CAKE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE AT THAT POINT SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MODEL AND I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE REPLICATED AROUND THE STATE. IN PARTICULAR I KNOW THAT MISTER HENDERSON WAS HERE EARLIER SPEAKING SHOWS THAT MODEL IN THE WAY IN WHICH IT SHOULD BE REPLICATED IN FACT- THAT THAT SHOULD BE A STATE MODEL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT GIVEN HIS EXPERIENCE PROBABLY THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TAKE PLACE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A INHERENT CONFLICT. WHEN YOU HAVE OFFICERS INVESTIGATING THEIR BODIES THEIR COWORKERS THEIR FRIENDS WHEN SO MUCH IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST. FOR OUR COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY THAT THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THESE INCIDENTS OF THIS POLICE MISCONDUCT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MCCARTY COMPLETE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE GO TO- ASSEMBLY WOMAN- RADIUS AND THEN WE WILL GO TO MISTER. DAVID E. THE STACK ME AFTERWARDS. MS RAISE YOU UP TO BAT. YOU MISTER CHAIR- THIS THIS CONCEPT TO PROVIDED BY A PROFESSOR EMERITUS I THINK IS WONDERFUL I CAN TELL BY THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE EXPLORING. IT IT APPEARS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO REGAIN THE TRUST YEAH AND IT'S THE TRUST OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE SERVING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEING SERVED GREATER TRUST IN THE POLICE. DEPARTMENT OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE PROTECTING THEM AND ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IT'S A IT'S EVIDENT HERE IS THAT BOTH THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE COMMUNITY WANT TO BE READ OF THE BAD. OFFICERS I THINK IF WE AS WE PROVIDE THIS PROTECTION TO THE PUBLIC. FIGURING OUT A WAY THAT WE PROTECT OUR MUNICIPALITIES- IT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS WE LOOK THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BUT THIS INSURANCE POLICY BECOMES A SECONDARY EVALUATION OR SECONDARY INVESTIGATION OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS. AND I THINK THAT IN AND OF ITSELF BECOME SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT CIVILIAN- COMMITTEES THAT DO THAT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IT INVESTIGATIONS BUT THIS BECOMES. IT'S VERY VERY OBJECTIVE AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE LIABILITY COVERAGE TO HOLD THE POSITION THE PROFESSIONAL POSITION OF POLICE OFFICER AND THERE IS NO INSURANCE COMPANY WILLING TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. YOU CAN'T GET THE JOB. AND THAT'S THE END OF IT AND IT RATHER THAN HAVING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CHIEFS- AND TO THE UNION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT TO DO. IF THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT'S A REQUIREMENT AND IF YOU CAN'T GET IT THERE HAS TO BE A REASON. WOULD BE DUE PROCESS SO THAT IF IT'S DENIED THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO- APPEAL THAT. IT'S BASED ON A DECISION OR A RECORD IN IN THEIR FILE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX THAT WELL I THINK THAT IN THE END THAT BECOMES A WIN WIN. FOR ALL OF OUR GREAT OFFICERS THAT ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING- AND IT DOESN'T PUT THEM ON THE DEFENSIVE OF IT HAVING TO TURN IN A BROTHER OR SISTER. BUT IT ALSO ENSURES THAT WE HAVE THE BEST ON THE STREET REPRESENTING REPRESENTING ALL OF US- I EAT IT THAT WAY YEAH THE DECERTIFICATION OF COURSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- BUT AT THE- PROFESSOR EMERITUS IN YEAH AND- IN THE EVALUATION. TO DO YOU SEE ANY OF. AS EIGHT EIGHT- AN APPEALS PROCESS IF ONE OF OUR OFFICERS IS DENIED THIS COVERAGE- BUT HAVE YOU LOOKED. DETERMINED WHAT THE APPEALS PROCESS WOULD BE FOR THEM. CAN'T HEAR YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES YES MA'AM- IN MANY STATES ARE THERE IS OUR BOARD AND ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD THAT YOU CAN TURN TO IF YOU FEEL THAT OUR DRIVER'S INSURANCE OR ANY OTHER INSURANCE- THAT THAT THE PREMIUMS WERE INAPPROPRIATE. SO IF YOU'RE A DRIVER- YOU GO TO THIS ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD EXISTS I BELIEVE IN EVERY STATE AND YOU SAY. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND THEY RAISE MY PREMIUM AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WAYS AND THEN SAYS WELL BUT YOU HIT TWO PEOPLE AND YOU HAD TO DRUNK DRIVING'S AND THE EITHER AFFIRM. OR OR SAY THAT IT WAS UNJUSTIFIED THE SETTING OF THE PREMIUM THE PRINT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU PAY- THEN AFTER THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL YOU THEN GO TO- THE TRIAL COURT. AND A COURT REVIEWS THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION WHETHER TO AFFIRM- THE SETTING OF THE PREMIUM AND SO A JUDGE- LOOKS AT IT AND MAKES A DETERMINATION USING DEFERENCE TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT- IN ASSESSING THE- INSURANCE COMPANIES DECISION BUT NONE THE LESS LOOKING AT IT AND SAYING IS THERE REASONABLE BASIS WHAT WAS THE EVIDENCE- WAS THE EVIDENCE. OBJECTIVE OR SUBJECTIVE- IS IT THE KIND OF THING THAT A REASONABLE PERSON CAN RELY UPON- AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- AND THAT HAS WORKED IN THE DRIVING CONTEXT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE TRUCK DRIVERS. COMPLAINED TO THEIR UNION THAT SOMETIMES THEIR PREMIUMS WERE BEING SET SO HIGH THAT THEY WERE PRICED OUT OF TRUCK DRIVING. AND THE UNION SAID WE CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY IS ON INDEPENDENT TERMINATION OF RISK ASSESSMENT ON THE ROADS. AND ARM SO IT DOESN'T IMPLICATE THE UNION AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND THEN THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND IF AFTER THAT- THERE'S A DETERMINATION OBVIOUSLY EVEN AFTER. THE JUDICIAL PROCESS YOU COULD APPEAL TO THE APPELLATE COURT FOR AN APPELLATE DECISION OF THE JUDICIAL DECISION ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY DECISION BUT THAT ALL. THOSE STRUCTURES ALREADY EXIST. THANK YOU IT MISTER CHAIR FOR MAY DO A FOLLOW QUESTION PLEASE WITH THE OTHER TWO YES PLEASE. MISTER MISTAKENLY AND TO MISTER TOUCHSTONE YOU REPRESENTING OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND ALSO REPRESENTING OUR POLICE CHIEFS. BUT WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF THIS NOVEL- CONCEPT OF. A PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE BEING A REQUIREMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. YEAH WELL THE. ONE MISTER MISTER YOU CAN GO FIRST ANA GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND WELL I GENERALLY FAVOR OUTSIDE OF THE BOX THINKING I THINK THAT THIS IDEA IS ILL ADVISED AND FATALLY FLAWED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. STARTING WITH THAT CALIFORNIA VALUES INCLUDE. UNIONS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS CIVIL SERVICE RULES THAT WE HAVE MERIT BASED HIRING NOT CRONYISM HAS BEEN FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND THAT YOU HAVE FAIRNESS AND ROOT OUT DISCRIMINATION. AND OPEN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENTS TO EVERYONE AND ANOTHER CALIFORNIA VALUE AND THIS IS BETTER RECOGNIZED BY THE COURTS AND IN A NUMBER OF STATUTES IS THAT EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE INDEMNIFIED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. BOTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND RECEIVE A DEFENSE AND IF YOU LOOK AT LABOR CODE TWENTY EIGHT OH TWO THERE IS A GENERAL RIGHT OF INDEMNITY THAT APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT REFINED THOSE. VAN NUYS IN DEAL WITH. THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NINE NINE FIVE AND EIGHT TWENTY FIVE THEY DEAL WITH THE RIGHT TO BE DEFENDED AND INDEMNIFIED AND THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT BECAUSE- YOU HAVE TO ALSO THINK ABOUT THE SITUATIONS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE ANY CRITICAL INCIDENT AN OFFICER IS GOING TO GET SUED THAT'S JUST THE FACT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE OFFICER'S ACTIONS WERE JUSTIFIED OR APPROPRIATE. AND BECAUSE OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY THE PUBLIC ENTITY IS THE DEEP POCKETS AND THE PUBLIC ENTITY IS THE ONE THAT THE PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS ARE GOING TO BE. I MERRILY SEEKING COMPENSATION FROM AND SO IF YOU CREATE A SPLIT WHERE. A PUBLIC EMPLOYER MIGHT FOR A GOOD ECONOMIC REASONS DECIDE HEY I CAN SETTLE THIS CASE FOR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S CHEAPER THAN TRYING IT EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD WIN IT WOULD COST US FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL IF THE OFFICER IS GOING TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW THESE ARE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN MAKING FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. GO OUT OF POCKET FOR THAT EXPENSE THEY'RE GONNA REFUSE TO SETTLE THE CASE. AND FORCE CASES TO TRIAL AND SO I THINK THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES- NEED TO BE CONSIDERED I'M SURE MR TOUCHSTONE HAS. MORE INSIGHTS ON THAT BUT I WANT TO HIT A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK THERE. ARE CRITICALLY MISSING. NUMBER ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO PRIVATE SECTOR. PROFESSIONS THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC SECTOR PROFESSIONS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DOCTORS AND I REPRESENT A LOT OF PUBLIC ATTORNEYS AND THEIR PRIVATE SECTOR ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC SECTOR ATTORNEYS BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNIQUE. WE ASK THESE MEN AND WOMEN TO RUN TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE. TO PROTECT US AND IF YOU LOOK AT PROFESSOR REMEMBERS HIS PROPOSALS. OR REALLY ANY KIND OF INSURANCE RACKS WORRY ILL ASSESSMENT. IT'S NOT MERIT BASED THESE CASES ARE TOO SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE THAT YOU LOOK AT STATISTICAL MODELS. THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN USED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE IN TERMS OF LENDING HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND IF THEY LOOK AT THINGS. YOU'RE COURTING TO MRS AMERICA PROFESSOR MARISS. PAPERS IT'S HOW MANY TIMES YOU'VE BEEN SUIT HAS BEEN SETTLED IT'S NOT A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE OFFICER ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING WRONG. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HAD AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN A CRITICAL INCIDENT INCLUDING BY THE WAY. EVEN IF THE OFFICER DIDN'T USE FORCE IN WAS JUST PRESIDENT. YOU LOOK AT THE ASSIGNMENTS THAT OFFICERS HAVE COULD YOU WILL CREATE VERY PERVERSE INCENTIVES WHERE OFFICERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR JOB IN THEIR PENSION WILL SHY AWAY FROM. THE WORK THAT WE NEED THE MOST TO DO AND THAT IS TO RUN TO THE SOUND OF THE GUN. TO PROTECT US THIS. WHEN SOME IS CREATE AN IMAGE THREAT. AND SO IF YOU'RE HONEST TEAM FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF CRITICAL INCIDENTS. PROBABLY OVER HALF OF THE CRITICAL INCIDENTS OF YOUR AGENCY YOU WILL INSTANTLY GET PRICED OUT OF. BEING A PEACE OFFICER UNDER THIS MODEL IF YOU'RE ON A WARRANT STEAM WHERE YOU'RE- GOING AND ARRESTING. VIOLENT FELONS YOUR MUCH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF. HAVING TO DEFEND YOURSELF IN A USE OF FORCE SITUATION OR HAVING A COMPLAINT MADE AGAINST YOU. AND WE REALLY AS A SOCIETY WANT TO SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE OFFICERS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO TRY TO GET INTO TRAINING OR OR- INVESTIGATIONS ARE DESK WORK. ANNA ANNA VOID PATROL WHERE THAT OFFICERS ON PATROL ARE SCARED TO TAKE PROACTIVE ACTION THAT WE ASK THEM TO DO WE WANT THEM TO DO. AND ONLY RESPOND TO. DISPATCH CALLS FOR SERVICE BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED THAT THEY WILL GET. PRICED OUT OF. THIS MARKET THERE'S OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS AND YOU RESPECTFULLY I CALIFORNIA NOT LIKE BOSTON AND SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES. WE HAVE A HOME RULE HERE WHICH PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM SETTING COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL EMPLOYEES IN SAYS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE. THAT LOCAL ENTITIES WOULD BE MANDATED TO ENSURE A BASE LEVEL OF INSURANCE WHICH IS AN INTERFERENCE IN MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS BECAUSE MANY AGENCIES CHOOSE TO SELF INSURE. AND THEN WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM AGREEING TO A COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT WOULD COVER THE COST OF. THE INDEMNIFICATION AND SO THE EFFECT WOULD BE WE WOULD BE SINGLING OUT A SPECIFIC CLASS OF EMPLOYEES AND SAY THE RULES THAT APPLY. TO EVERY OTHER EMPLOYEE IN CALIFORNIA. DO NOT APPLY TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT US. AND WE WOULD BE CREATING THESE INCENTIVES THAT I THINK ARE. CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY WHEN YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW AS MR LACKEY SAID OTHER PROFESSIONS LIKE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS THEY HAVE TIME. AND THEY HAVE TRANQUILITY TO MAKE JUDGMENTS THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE TO BUY INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE THAT'S A MISNOMER UNLESS YOU'RE A SOLO PRACTITIONER. EVERY TURN AT MY OFFICE IS INSURED BY THE BUSINESS FOR THEIR MALPRACTICE THE SAME IS TRUE OF MEDICAL GROUPS PUBLIC ATTORNEY'S. PUBLIC DOCTORS. AND SO. FROM JUST A FUNDAMENTAL POLICY STANDPOINT I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT IN PLACE. INCENTIVES THAT MAKE AGENCIES AND OFFICERS NOT ONE TO RUN TO THE SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE NOT WANT TO GIVE US PROTECTION AND ONE FINAL POINT IS THE SUPREME COURT AND THIS BODY RECOGNIZED THAT BECAUSE- EVERY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WITH THE STATUTE CALLED MICROSOFT THAT WE WERE GOING TO PRICE DOCTORS OUT OF THE MARKET WITH MALPRACTICE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE STATE IMPOSED A HARD CAP OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LIABILITY ON DOCTORS IN ORDER TO STABILIZE. THE INSURANCE MARKET SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A FLIGHT OF DOCTORS FROM THE STATE AND I WOULD SUBMIT. TO THIS BODY THAT THERE IS A VERY REAL RISK WE ALREADY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF OFFICERS IN THE STATE THAT THIS PRESCRIPTION. I THINK IT WOULD BE FAR WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM THAT IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE. JUST ONE COMMENT IF I MAY- MISTER MISTAKENLY YOU SAID THAT BUT DEPLOYS- ARTICLE WOULD BE AT IDENTA INDEMNIFIED- AND THAT THAT'S A RIGHT THEY HAVE. HOWEVER FOR AND IF AN EMPLOYEE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF AN EMPLOYEE- IT IS HE IS FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT. THE RULES ARE NOT THE SAME IF THEY DID AN INTENTIONAL CRIMINAL ACT THEN THEY ARE GOING TO BE THEY CAN BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE BUT IN ALL OTHER INSTANCES I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT AN EMPLOYEE EING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE CITY OF THE MUNICIPAL HELPED ME JUST BE A MUNICIPALITY WOULD- WOULD HAVE THAT PROTECTION. BUT IT IS AT THIS POINT GET THAT NOT I THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT I DID- MET THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION IS LIMITED TO COURSE AND SCOPE AND SO IF AN OFFICER GO COULD IT COMMITS A CRIME THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT THEY'RE NOT INDEMNIFIED NOR SHOULD THEY BE IN THE SAME IS TRUE OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHEN THERE'S AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF SOMEONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BUT IN THE ROUTINE DAY TO DAY EMPLOYMENT. I SEND YOU TO THE SHOT FIRED THE SHOTS FIRED CALL AND YOU APPROPRIATELY DEFEND YOURSELF OR TO FIND A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FOR SURE YOU'RE GETTING STUDENT CALIFORNIANS SO AN INSURANCE BROKER LOOKING AT THAT IS GOING TO SAY WELL YOU'RE ON THE SWAT TEAM YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONDING TO CALLS THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA GET SUED I DON'T CARE WHETHER OR NOT. YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG I JUST CARE THAT MIGHT YOUR LIABILITIES GOING TO GO UP AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO DEFEND MORE LAWSUITS BECAUSE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT THAT YOU TOOK AND SO YOU'RE PRICED OUT OF THE PROFESSION I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS I THINK THAT IF THIS IS PURSUED AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. I THINK YOUR VOICE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU CERTAINLY DO A GREAT JOB OF DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OUR OFFICERS YOUR COMMENTS ARE- VERY WELL TAKEN AND THAT THAT VOICE NEEDS TO BE HEARD AS WE IF THIS IS SOMETHING WE WOULD WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IMPLEMENTING BECAUSE. IT SEEMS THAT. OTHER I DO. HAPPEN TO REALLY WORKED IN THAT WE GOT TO FIND THOSE NON. IDEAS AS YOU SAID WE HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX BUT- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER. TOUCHSTONE S. THANK YOU MA'AM I GO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ON THAT QUITE FRANKLY NUMBER ONE POLICING IS UNIQUE- IT IS SOMETHING WHERE A PERSON IS PLACED IN A LIFE ENDANGERING SITUATION HAS TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND JUDGMENTS IT IS NOT COMPARABLE WHATSOEVER IN MY OPINION TO DOCTORS WHO- HAVE TIME TO PLAN TO MAKE A SURGICAL PLAN EXAMINE A PATIENT MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEIR FACE TO MAKE A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION AND BY THE WAY QUITE FRANKLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FOR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE THEREFORE MORE PEOPLE DYING TO DO THAT THAN ANY POLICING ACTIONS ARE TO TAKE PLACE IN ANY STATE. AND YET WE ARE LIMITING THROUGH MICRO THE DAMAGES THAT CAN BE WAR AWARDED AGAINST DOCTORS WHY BUT THE REASON THE MISTER STAGNANT JUST MENTIONED THERE WAS A FLOOD OF DOCTORS FROM CALIFORNIA- AND THAT'S WHAT PRECIPITATED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MY PREFECT AYE MY FIRST JOB. OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I REPRESENTED DOCTORS. DEFENDING A MATTER MAIL- ACT. SO THAT'S EXACTLY TRUE IT WILL RESULT IN- NOT ONLY WEST PEOPLE. BEING IN THE PROFESSION BUT ALSO DEEPLY SENT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU MAY BE SUBJECTED TO A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP DRIVING A POLICE CRUISER AROUND WITHOUT HAVING ANY KIND OF PROACTIVE POLICING AND WE KNOW STATISTICALLY WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT RESULTS IN A DECLINATION OF PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE SNOW STATE. CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS I SHOULD SELECT SO I THAT IS THAT THOSE STATISTICS WE PRUDENT AND FRANKLY THIS IS CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT CHICAGO NOT NEW YORK THAT OFFICER FROM NEW YORK WOULD NOT BE ON ANY POLICE FORCE THAT I REPRESENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH YOU HAD THAT MANY SUSTAIN COMPLAINTS IN ON THAT ISSUE I MEAN IS IT THE MODEL OF. ACTUARIAL CITING IT IS EXACTLY TRUE ANYONE CAN GET SUITED ANYTIME THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THAT LAWSUIT DOESN'T AMERICAN IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE. AS AN ACTUARIAL FACTOR. ANYONE CAN BE. PRICED OUT OF POLICING. A THE MEDIA BECAUSE JUST. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SUBJECT TO A LAWSUIT OR A CITIZENS COMPLAINT. AND BY THE WAY I'M ALL FOR OBVIOUSLY FOR SUSAN'S COMPLAINT IS. SUSTAINED THAT OFFICER SHOULD BE DISCIPLINED. THAT'S WHAT MY FIRM DICE AND WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. HOWEVER THE MERE. ALLEGATION OF. MISCONDUCT IS SOMETHING THAT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND IF THAT IS A FACTOR USE FOR. TERMINATING THIS ACTUARIAL TABLES FOR OFFICERS I COULD FILE TWENTY DIFFERENT- COMPLAINTS RIGHT NOW TODAY AGAINST TWENTY DIFFERENT OFFICERS AT THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FOR ME. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ANY OF THEM OR MISS- HAVE ANY MERIT AT ALL. THE AND WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT UNTIL WE GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT SOLELY. DOWN. THAT SIMPLY IT'S GOING TO. I'M IT COULD POTENTIALLY. GET OUT OF POLICE HUGE SHOULD EMPLOYED. AND QUITE FRANKLY WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT I MEAN FOR LOOKING AT THAT I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT. MODIFYING PENAL CODE SECTION ONE FORTY EIGHT POINT SIX THAT'S BEEN HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND THAT'S A- THING THAT MAKES IT A CRIME TO MAKE A FALSE COMPLAINT AGAINST A POLICE OFFICER. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE THAT CONTENT NEUTRAL TO- FIX THAT A- CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE AND WE COULD HELP PREVENT SOME OF THESE COMPLAINTS. I WILL TELL YOU QUITE FRANKLY SOME OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT I VERY SOPHISTICATED. THERE ARE OFFICERS WHO ARE IN DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENTS SUCH AS DRUG ENFORCEMENT. PLATOONS AND SO FORTH. IT MANY TIMES AGAIN A TYPICALLY. A GANG MEMBERS- TELL ACTIVITY THEY WILL GO IN AND INTENTIONALLY FILE CITIZENS COMPLAINTS AGAINST OFFICER OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THAT CREATES THIS PIN NUMBER OF THIS CONTACT ABOUT THAT OFFICER EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THEM MAY BE MERITORIOUS I'VE SEEN NOT. WHERE YOU HAVE AN OFFICER WHO IS SOMEONE WHO IS ENGAGING AND PROPER POLICING AND IS RESULTING IN THE REST OF THESE- MEMBERS OF THESE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS BUT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE DOING ITS IT'S A COUNTER OFFENSIVE QUITE FRANKLY AND SOMETIMES NOT OFFICER EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THOSE TO STATES OR COMPLAINTS OR SUSTAIN ITS MOVE TO ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT WHERE HE OR SHE IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM A PROBLEM FOR THAT CRIME ORGANIZATION. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE ON BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CALLS CITIZENS ABOUT THESE ISSUES TOUCHTONE HARM YEP THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE TO MEMBERS IN THE QUEUE AND I SEE MISTER A POINTER UP WHO'S ONE OF OUR PRESENTERS GOING TO RECOGNIZE HIM- MYSTERIES ARE YOU COMPLETE. YES THANK YOU MUST CHAIR THANK YOU SO VERY I WANT TO GO TO MISTER A CHAT MAYES- WHO'S ON THE LINE- AND THEN WE WILL. GO TO MISTER POINTER AND THEN MR MCCARTY. MR MACE. AND WE THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC COMMENT TO SELL CREDIT. CHECK OUT YES I JUST WANTED TO- TALK ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF THE PRESENTERS- AND MAYBE- YOU BACK ON I MISS IS RACIST COMMENTS- THE FACT THAT MRS RAMIREZ IS PROPOSAL- BUT TALK ABOUT PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF IT TODAY- AND- IT'S I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS LOOKING FOR. A THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. NOW FOR SIX YEARS. PUZZLE MIGHT HAVE ITS FLAWS- I DO THINK IT'S WORTH EXPLORING AND I THINK IT'S ALSO A WORTH- THOSE WHO MIGHT BE OPPOSED TO IT ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AT A TABLE AND KIND OF WORK THROUGH THINGS BECAUSE- THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- IS CAN BE MESSY BUT OFTEN WHEN. A COMPETING COMPETING VALUES CIDR TO TABLE YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT WORKS- WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THE LEGISLATURE TO THIS NEXT YEAR. IS SOME SORT OF PROPOSAL THAT WOULDN'T WORK A MORE SORT OF FORCING IT DOWN THE THROAT OF SOMEBODY THE OTHER SIDE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SIT DOWN AND COME UP WITH WITH THE SOLUTION AND THIS IDEA PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE DISMISSING IT- AT ALL RIGHT WE'VE ONLY HEARD- WE'VE ONLY HAD A DISCUSSION NOW FOR. FOR THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ON IT I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE- WE NEED TO SEE IF THIS WILL WORK IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN FINE WE'LL MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE BUT THIS COMMITTEE IS ABOUT THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE AND HOW WE CAN IN CALIFORNIA. A REALLY LEAD ON THE ON THESE ISSUES SO- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH YEAH I WOULD HOPE THAT IT- THAT WELL YOU WOULD REACH OUT TO ME- OR REACH OUT TO OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION MAYBE PUT SOMETHING OUT IF THERE IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION- THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN. IN AUTHORING AND THEN WE CAN BEGIN TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO LOOK FOR THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE NOT JUST DISMISS THINGS OUT RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT TO GO TO I'M GOING TO GO TO MR MCCARTY AND THEN HAVE JUST POINTED OUT THE FINAL WORD- MISTER MCCARTY. YEAH SO LOOK WE'RE NOT VOTING ON A BILL TODAY- NOT A PROPOSAL BUT I'M JUST KIND OF CONFUSE THAT PEOPLE ARE CONFLATING THEIR PROPOSALS AND YOU KNOW WHILE I'M SITTING HERE. I'M READING WHAT HAPPENED IN COLORADO IN THE IDEA OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LIABILITY INSURANCE. AND THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE PAYS PAYS THE PREMIUMS AND SO THE EXPOSURE ISN'T TOO. INSTEAD FOR THE END DATE THE ENTIRE- A SETTLEMENT OR JUDGMENT IT'S. JUST OF THAT PIECE OF TWENTY FIVE. SO IT'S NOT. THE YOU KNOW THAT. NOT INSURANCE OR- HE WHAT THAT'S- HAVE HAVE. AND SO- DOT. I'M I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS. OUR OUR- THE PEOPLE OBJECT TO IT OBJECTING THE HYPOTHETICAL OF HAVING- HAVING TO PAY. INSURANCE AND BEING EXPOSED FOR AN ENTIRE POTENTIAL JUDGMENT OR JUST FOR THAT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PIECE. MISTER MISTER AGNEW WAS GOING TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION REAL QUICK. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT IT'S REALLY THE CONCEPT I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DEGREE IN TERMS OF IF YOU WANT TO PUT A CAP ON HOW MUCH LIABILITY. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THE BIGGEST OF WHICH IS THAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU WANT TO INCENTIVIZE OFFICERS TO DO A GOOD JOB BUT ALSO TO HELP PEOPLE. AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND- THE NATURE OF INSURANCE BUSINESS AND ALL THE RHTHMS AND STATISTICS IS THAT YOU MAKE PREDICTIVE ASSUMPTIONS. BASED ON. THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE FACTUAL YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT MERIT BASED DETERMINATIONS OR THE NUANCES OF EACH INCIDENT YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT HOW MANY TIMES WERE YOU SOON WERE YOU PRESENT WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING. NIGHT DID YOU ACT APPROPRIATELY WAS A JUSTIFIED AND SO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT'S STILL. I THINK SUFFERS FROM THE SAME FATAL FLAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ARE YOU GOODNESS MCCARTY. YEAH I JUST THINK THAT YOU'RE CONFLATING IT- AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PREMIUM IS NOT GOING TO BE. OUT OF THE HANDS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WOULD PROBABLY BARGAIN AND PAID FOR BY THE P. O. A CONTRACT OR HAVING A WHOLESALE. BUYING OF THE COVERAGE LIKE WE SAW IN COLORADO SO. I THINK IT'S AN INTRIGUING ISSUE I THINK AS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT DOUBLES THE DETAILS BUT I DON'T THINK. IT SHOULD BE DISMISSED JUST BECAUSE THE NATURE OF IT- PEOPLE MAY THINK IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE OR IT SHOULD BE HAD IT HAD SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AT ALL. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR POINTER THANK YOU. IF I MAIL TO MAKE THIS. PRETTY BRIEF. THE OF LIFE INSURANCE IS NOT I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT SHOULD JUST BE REJECTED OUTRIGHT. I IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE IN DIFFERENT FACETS IN AREAS OF OUR LIFE AND THERE'S WAYS IN WHICH IF. ANY WOULD BROAD STROKES THE IDEA THAT WILL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS WILL BE JUST TAKEN OUT OF HAND AND WILL RESULT IN AND ADJUST SITUATION WHERE OFFICES ARE PRICED OUT OF THE PROFESSION. FRANKLY WE KNOW FROM THE STATISTICS THE AVERAGE OFFICER IS NOT EVEN ON THE USED THEIR GUN IN THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER. MANY OFFICERS GO THEIR ENTIRE CAREER WITHOUT A SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE. MANY COMPLAINTS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN LIVES BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS MORE THAN ONCE TWICE TWO OR THREE TIMES. THOSE ARE THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. I SAT THERE AND HOLD THESE MOTHERS HELD THEIR HANDS WHILE THEY'RE WATCHING THEIR LOVED ONE BE BURIED. I'VE ALSO TAKING DEPOSITIONS OF OFFICERS WHO WERE ACCUSED OF THINGS WHICH WE DISMISSED THE WE'VE DISMISSED LAWSUIT IF WE WIND UP GETTING INTO THE CASE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE OFFICER. WAS NOT AT FAULT OR LOFT OR UNLAWFULLY EXECUTING. THEIR DUTIES. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS. THE BACK. IN JUST THE AUTOMATIC MAIL. THE IDEA THAT OFFICERS CANNOT BE REINED IN. THE IDEA THAT WE CANNOT COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS TO ADDRESS AN OLD PROBLEM. THAT DAY IS OVER. YOU'RE A RELIC OF THE DINOSAURS IF YOU JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK FROM THE PUBLIC'S WE'LL AND DEMAND THAT WE DO SOMETHING BETTER. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING. AND DON'T FALL INTO THE TRAP OF THE FALSE OF A FALSE ALTERNATIVE OF SAYING OU MUST EITHER ELECT TO ALLOW OFFICERS TO HAVE FREE REIGN. OR YOU'RE GONNA BRING OFFICERS IN INDIAN OFFICE NO ONE'S GOING TO WANT TO BE IN THE PROFESSION AND THEN THAT RESULTS IN LAWLESSNESS. THOSE TYPE OF BROAD BASED CLAIMS HAVE NO REAL BASIS IN FACT AND FRANKLY THEY SHOULD BE A PART FOR CHANGE AND I APPRECIATE THE SELECT COMMITTEES OPPORTUNITY AND A PLATFORM TO TALK ABOUT REAL DISCUSSION REAL SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WANT TO NOW OPEN TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT SEGMENT- TO THE PUBLIC I WANT TO AGAIN MINUS THE PUBLIC- THOSE WILL BE TESTIFYING- YOU BE TESTIFIED BEHIND THE PLEXIGLASS BUT DO YOU NEED THE MICROPHONE ELEVATE WILL DO SO.

AND. PLEASE PROCEED. REVENUE MY NAME IS RYAN HARRIS I AM CHEN COUNT FOR THE- CALIFORNIA. OF BLACK LAWYERS. FIRST OFF ON THE COMMISSION WITH A COMMITTEE. ON TAKING UP THIS ASSIGNMENT AND HAVING THESE MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLICE REFORM. I DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT PART OF THE NEED FOR POLICE REFORM HAS TO HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL. PARTICULARLY IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AS THEY ARE OFTEN TIMES CALLED IN TO REVIEW SERIOUS ISSUES INVOLVING USE OF FORCE MISCONDUCT- TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS. I WANT TO POINT OUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM GIVEN THAT HERE WERE THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OR HIS REPRESENTATIVE OUR NOTEBOOKS NOTICEABLY ABSENT. AND WE NEED TO HAVE FOR LEADERSHIP IN THAT SPACE THAT IS GOING TO WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT IS GOING TO ADD INPUT TO THESE CONVERSATIONS. AND INPUT THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND BASED OFF OF EXPERIENCE AND DATA THAT AND I REALLY WANT TO. FOCUS ON THIS THAT FOSTERS AND ENGENDERS PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- MISTER HENDERSON TESTIFIED EARLIER TODAY. I THINK OFFERED A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO THAT SPACE. AS I MENTIONED IN A PRIOR HEARING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS HAS CREATED A LIST OF TOP CONTAINERS FOR THAT APPOINTMENT. BY THE GOVERNOR AND MISTER HENDERSON IS ON THAT LIST ALONG WITH- TIME BACK THEN AND- TERI WILEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WITH THIS CONVERSATION AND HELPING YOU GUYS REACH AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION THAT FOSTERS LASTING. AND POSITIVE. REFORM FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TO. NEXT PLEASE DUBBED. AND WE WILL ADJUST IT FOR YOU. AND WHEN YOU'RE READY OF TWO MINUTES. ALL RIGHT FOR TIME'S SAKE I'M GONNA READ- MY NAME IS MARIE SOMEWHERE MY FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IT'S SAD THAT WE EVEN HAVE TO BE HERE BUT I'M GLAD WE LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN ORDER TO BRING CHANGE. AGAIN MY NAME IS MARIE SUMMER ALISON ON THE SISTER OF AUGUSTINE ROUSE WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY SECOND POLICE OFFICER JEREMIAH JARVIS ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH MY BROTHER WAS ONE OF THREE POLICE KILLINGS IN JUST THE PAST SIX WEEKS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ON WEDNESDAY THE QUESTION WAS POSED HOW TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY AND ONE OF THE ITEMS I MENTIONED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY ON BOTH PARTIES BUT I'D LIKE TO ADD ACCURATE REPORTING BECAUSE EVEN IN MY BROTHER'S CASE THERE ARE MANY DISCREPANCIES IN THE REPORTING PERSONS THE VIDEO FOOTAGE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ANOTHER THING TO CHANGE IS THE USE OF FORCE POLICY THAT ALLOWED OFFICERS TO I QUOTE USE DEADLY FORCE IF UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES THE SUSPECT POSES A THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY EITHER TO THE OFFICER. OR TO OTHERS AND QUOTE. WE NEED TO FIRST A FINAL REASONABLY. BELIEVE MEANS BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW ALL THE POLICE OFFICER HAS TO SAY IS I FEAR FOR MY LIFE AND THAT GIVES THEM THE LICENSE TO KILL. BUT WHAT ABOUT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. THEY SOMETIMES FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES BUT THEY CAN'T JUST GO AROUND KILLING EACH OTHER WITHOUT SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. THIS POLICY GIVES POLICE OFFICERS THE POWER AND AUTHORITY TO BECOME THE JUDGE AND THE TIME AND ONE FATE AS GUILTY. THUS DENYING A PERSON'S THE FIFTH SIXTH AND SEVENTH BILL OF RIGHTS. THE FIFTH. DUE PROCESS THE SIX. THREE TRIAL BY ONE'S PEERS AND THE SEVENTH. THAT PROVIDES CIVIL CASES ALSO BE TRIED BY A JURY. THESE ARE THE- TO THE CONCERT. THAT THE OFFICER HAVE VAL TO PROTECT. BUT THESE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND BILLS OF RIGHTS ARE DENIED WHEN OFFICERS KILL A PERSON. AND PLEASE UNDERSTAND I'M NOT SAYING OFFICER TO KILL PEOPLE ARE. ARE BAD PEOPLE LIKE WE'RE THINK WEEDING OUT THE BAD APPLES. NOT EVEN THE ONE WHO KILLED MY BROTHER HE MAY BE A GOOD COP. AND A GOOD PERSON BUT THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE THEM FROM BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING A BAD DECISION. I CAN BE A GOOD PERSON MY WHOLE LIFE. BUT IF I TAKE LAW INTO MY OWN HANDS AND KILL SOMEONE. THAT I HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. SO I ASK YOU TO PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE. LADY JUSTICE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GOD. BECAUSE GOD IS NOT LIKE RULERS SUPPRESS THEIR PEOPLE. SO AGAIN EXHAUSTION PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING. WHEN YOU KNOW JUST THINKING OF THE LAW FOR POLICE REFORM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE HAVE OUR NEXT- SPEAKER. THANK YOU ALSO HAVE TWO MINUTES AND PERCENT WHEN READY THANK YOU- I AM ROXANNE MORALIS MOTHER OF AUGUSTINE MORALIS I WAS SHOT AND KILLED ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH OF THIS YEAR- FIRST I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE TO CHIEF HANA NO HE'S NOT HERE TODAY. BUT WHEN I REVIEWED THE COP CAM OF THE SHOOTING- I SPOKE TO HIM AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE OATH OF THE POLICE OFFICERS AND I THOUGHT THAT THE- INCLUDED TO SERVE AND PROTECT. IT DOES NOT. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION IS IN THERE- SPECIFICALLY THE SECOND AMENDMENT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL BUT THE POLICE OR THE AGENCIES. NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AS WELL AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES. MY SON HAD AGAIN AND I KNOW HE WAS A REGISTERED GUN OWNER. IF THE MAN. OFFICER WHO SHOT MY SON IN THE BACK THIRTEEN TIMES WITHOUT ANNOUNCING HIMSELF WOULD HAVE ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND INSTEAD TOLD MY SON TO DROP HIS WEAPON. MY SON WOULD BE AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY OR POSSIBLY IN JAIL I DON'T KNOW. OTHERWISE HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. BUT INSTEAD OF. HE LITERALLY CREPT UP ON MY SON AND SHOT HIM IN THE BACK. THIRTEEN TIMES. THAT IS AN ENEMY MOVE. BACK SHOULD ONLY TAKE PLACE DURING WAR. SOMEONE THAT IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TAKE OVER OUR GOVERNMENT. I READ AND I'M QUOTING FOR POLICE SHOOTING SOMEONE IN THE BACK VIOLATED ETHICAL PRINCIPLE OF ENGAGEMENT. AND NOTED EXCEPTION IF THE FLEEING PERSON POSES A SERIOUS THREAT MY SON WAS NOT PULLING HIS PANTS HE WAS STANDING. STATIONARY BETWEEN TWO CARS I STAND HERE PEACEFULLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO ACID ANYONE WHO SHOOTS AND KILLS A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES TO STAND TRIAL IF YOU CHOOSE TO KILL ANOTHER HUMAN YOU MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHY IS IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BUT A BATCH THAT YOU NO LONGER HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ANSWER TO THE LAW FOR COUPLES OVER ANOTHER COPY THERE LET GO EVEN IF HE'S DEEMED A D. Y. DRINKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. WHY WHO IS ABOVE THE LAW THERE IS NONE. THERE IS ONE WHICH IS GOD THESE OFFICERS ARE STARTING TO PLAY GOD AND THAT'S DANGEROUS GROUND AGAIN I STAND BEFORE YOU PEACEFULLY I COULD STAND LOUDLY AND GATHER PROTESTERS AND TAKE TO THE STREETS BUT MY SON WOULDN'T WANT THAT. HE WOULDN'T WANT THE STREETS ARE SACRAMENTO TO BE IN RUINS THAT WE WILL SEEK JUSTICE FOR OUR TRUE PEACEMAKER THE HERO OF OUR FAMILY AUGUSTINE MORALIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
