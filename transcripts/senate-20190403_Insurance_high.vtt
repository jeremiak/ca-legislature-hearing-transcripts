FIRESTONE'S VERSUS.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.000
YOU KNOW PERHAPS URBAN AREAS I

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:55.867
GET THAT.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:58.904
BUT I GUESS -- YOUR MIGHT MY

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.106
QUESTION IS THAT I I I'VE.

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:03.141
I WONDER IF YOUR OFFICE COULD

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.643
CHECK INTO THIS.

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:07.646
BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER AREAS WHEN

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:09.648
THEY DO A BY ZIP CODE.

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:11.016
YEAH THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:13.084
RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE LIKE ONE

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.820
ZIP CODE AND IT'S EVERYBODY.

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.288
IN IT DOESN'T REALLY.

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.790
ACCOUNT -- FOR PROPERTIES THAT

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:21.226
HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE LOTS OF

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.395
DEFENSIBLE SPACE WE TOURED A

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:25.063
COUPLE THOSE HOMES THAT -- YOU

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.965
HAVE LIKE ACRES AND ACRES AND

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:28.433
ACRES OF VINEYARDS AROUND THEM

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.568
AND WEREN'T BURNED BECAUSE THE

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.068
VINEYARDS.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.436
BUTTON YOU'RE NOW THEY'RE

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:33.471
LOOKING AT THE FAIR PLAN BECAUSE

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.974
THEY CAN'T GET ANYBODY.

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:38.677
TO ENSURE THAT MEANT SO I I

00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:40.212
GUESS I WONDER.

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:42.714
IF INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:45.951
THESE TYPE OF PRACTICES THAT.

00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:48.420
NOT BY MY REVIEW BY THE

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:50.055
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER REVIEW

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:51.690
SHOULD BE ALLOWED.

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.292
TO I TAKE ALL THE THE CREAM THE

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.927
TO THE URBAN AREAS THAT IS NOT

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:58.530
SUBJECT TO THE FIRES THAT --

00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:01.066
YEAH WE HAVE SO I GET RISK I GET

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.968
THE FACT THAT -- THEY SHOULD BE

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:04.703
ABLE TO INCREASE RATES IF IF THE

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:05.670
REST WERE HIGHER BUT I'M

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:06.438
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.939
THOUGHTS ON THAT AND WHAT WE DO

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:09.107
GOING FORWARD.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.342
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.444
WORKING HARD TO TRY TO MITIGATE

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.678
THE REST FOR THAT THEIR

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:16.715
THEMSELVES IN THE COMPANY

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:17.849
ABSOLUTELY SENATOR OF C. RIGHT

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.251
WE'RE SEEING AN UPTICK IN OUR

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:19.818
RENEWALS.

00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:21.720
AND PARTICULARLY IN THESE THESE

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.855
IN HIGH RISK AREAS IT IS PART OF

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:24.956
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:25.957
HAVING THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:26.758
OFFICE.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.193
IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.362
I WILL BE éEASING

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:33.465
FEEL THAT LOOK WE NEED TO EVEN

00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:34.299
LET'S BE HONEST EVEN THE FAIR

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.735
PLAN IS NOT GONNA BE AFFORDABLE

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:37.702
FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS.

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:39.838
AND SO THE NEED FOR US TO CREATE

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:42.173
ADDITIONAL OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.375
GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE THERE ARE

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.976
GONNA BE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:46.945
HOW DO WE ARE NOT ONLY.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.713
WORK WITH THE LOCAL CITIES TO

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.549
MAKE SURE THAT THE CITIES HAVE A

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:53.952
CITY WIDE -- PROGRAM IN TERMS OF

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.921
HOW DO THEY CREATE MARIA

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:57.522
DEFENSIBLE SPACE BUT WHAT REALLY

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.291
PRIORITIZE IN TERMS OF HOW WE

00:25:59.357 --> 00:26:01.126
MANAGE THEIR OWN RISK.

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:03.595
SO THAT MOVING FORWARD -- WE GET

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.697
TO A POINT WHERE IT'S NOT ONLY

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.632
US WORKING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.668
HOMEOWNERS BUT THE CITY AS WELL

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.203
AS THE ACTUAL PLAN -- WE ARE WE

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.805
ARE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.408
AGAIN WE NEED TALKS ARE ACTUALLY

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:17.409
ALSO.

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:23.348
HAVE THAT ON HIS CONVERSATION

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:24.149
ABOUT LAND USE.

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:24.816
AND AND THAT RESPOND WHO'S

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.251
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THAT

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:26.718
AND MAKING SURE THAT.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.353
WHEN WE REBUILD WE REBUILD IN A

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:28.987
WAY THAT'S MUCH MORE REASONS IT

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:29.721
MUCH MORE RESILIENT?

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.756
AND THAT IS NOT GONNA CERTAINLY

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:34.159
YOU KNOW OUR BE OVERLY EXPENSIVE

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.627
WERE PUT FOLKS ARE NOT GONNA BE

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.295
ABLE. TO TO REBUILD BACK IN THE

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.630
COMMUNITIES SO THESE ARE THE

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:39.664
TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:40.532
WITH THE STRIKE TEAM WE ARE

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:41.766
GOING TO BE ENGAGING THE

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:44.035
INSURANCE COMPANIES -- WE WANT

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:44.803
THEM TO COME WHAT THEIR

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:45.837
SOLUTIONS AS WELL ON WHAT THEIR

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:47.839
IDEAS WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING THAT

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.274
MEETING VERY SHORTLY -- BUT YOU

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:51.476
CAN REST ASSURED THAT THIS IS

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:52.043
ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WE'RE

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.144
TALKING ABOUT.

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:54.946
WE KNOW THAT FOR A LOT OF OUR

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:57.849
VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.584
THE CURRENT MODELS AND CURRENT

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:00.819
PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE.

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.854
I'M NOT GONNA BE AFFORDABLE.

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:04.322
AND SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:05.824
AND WE WOULD FIRST ONE ENGAGE

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.226
THE INDUSTRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:09.160
IDEAS THEY HAVE.

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.595
AND THEN WORK WITH THEM TO

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:11.963
FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.531
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION HAS

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:15.500
TO BE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.101
WHEN IT COMES.

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:17.769
TO CITY LAND USE ISSUES WHEN IT

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.237
COMES TO WHAT THE INSURANCE

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.672
PRODUCTS CURRENTLY ARE THAT WE

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:21.706
HAVE.

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.074
AND HOW DO WE WORK ON INNOVATIVE

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.876
PRODUCTS AND WHEN I SAY

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:26.277
INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OUR PRODUCTS

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:27.645
ARE GOING TO HELP US ADDRESS.

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.914
THE NEED OF PROVIDING INSURANCE

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.584
IN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE WHAT

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.019
WE'RE SEEING IS.

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:35.587
ARE YOU SEEING FOLKS THAT HAVE

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.689
PARTIAL LOSSES.

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.724
WHO ARE LIKE TELLING US WORK

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:40.125
LOOK?

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:41.726
NOW I HAVE A PROPERTY HERE THAT

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.527
I'M NOT ONLY NOT COULD BE WILL

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:43.261
ENSURE.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.863
THAT NOW IS A DROP IN PROPERTY

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:46.698
VALUE AND NOW THAT I'M STUCK

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:47.265
WITH.

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.400
AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS THAT HAVE

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:52.203
TOTAL LOSSES WHO CAN TAKE THEIR

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:52.771
AND I'M SURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:53.671
YOU'RE SEEING THIS.

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.907
TAKE THEIR THEIR CLAIM MONEY AND

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.609
MOVE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY RIGHT

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:58.910
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.245
PLOTS OF LAND THAT ARE NOW BEING

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:01.179
SOLD.

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:03.281
AT A MUCH LOWER RATE AND PEOPLE

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.682
ARE COMING IN BUYING THEM TO

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:07.452

PRESENT ON THOSE AND THEN HAVE A

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.041
MORE ROBUST CONVERSATION.

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.609
THE THE OTHER POINT IS IS

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.478

NORTHRIDGE -- PROPERTY DAMAGE IS

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.546
RESIDENTIAL AND HALF OF THAT WAS

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:53.417

CHEAP BACK AT THE NORTHRIDGE

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.087
STRUCK BECAUSE NO ONE UNDERSTOOD

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:57.821
THE RISK.

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.423

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.191

THE LAW PLACED A BILLION DOLLARS

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.262
IN STATUTE AND BASICALLY SAID

HAS GONE UP OVER A 170%.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.596

THEM.

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.812
YOUR PLAN WAS CREATED BY STATUTE

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.180

AND THE BELLER FIGHTERS ONE

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:10.686
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE

LEGISLATURE -- EFFECTIVELY ASKS

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:16.325
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO CREATE

ASSOCIATION.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.930
WITH FOUR WITH.

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.498
FOUR PURPOSES THE FIRST IS TO

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:25.100
ASSURE THE STABILITY OF THE

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:25.768
PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IN THE

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:26.402
STATE.

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.971
SURE THE AVAILABILITY OF BASIC

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.739
PROPERTY INSURANCE IN THE STATE.

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:33.008
TO ENCOURAGE THE MAXIMUM USE OF

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:34.276
THE NORMAL INSURANCE MARKET

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.411
OTHER WORDS DON'T COMPETE WITH

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.879
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.616
AND THEN -- FOR THE ADMITTED

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.118
INSURERS TO ESTABLISH A FAIR

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.119
PLAN SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.387
MANDATES IN THE IN THE CODE

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.223
ITSELF.

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.624
THE FAIR PLAN IS AVAILABLE TO

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:52.361
ANYBODY WHO HAS.

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:54.063
INSURABLE PROPERTY MEANS THAT

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.531
MEANS THERE IS YOU KNOW THE ROOF

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.500
NOT FALLING APART THERE'S NO ON

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.901

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.369
THE FAIR PLAN WILL NOT TURN

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:01.871
ANYBODY AWAY BASE SOMEWHERE

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:04.273
THEIR PROPERTIES LOCATED HOW

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.308
MANY TREES ARE ON THERE PRETTY --

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.277
WHAT THE PROTECTION CLASSES

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.079

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.950
CONDITION THAT IS.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:15.885
PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON WHY

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.754

PLANTED WE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:58.827
RATES IN THE URBAN AREAS BECAUSE

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.162
OUR LOSS EXPERIENCE IN THE URBAN

THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.537
SPEAKING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.172
YOU'RE ALL AWARE THERE WAS A CAR

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:10.372
FIRE.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:11.773
ALL BY.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.674
ON THE SAME DAY THE CAMP ON THE

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.443
WALLS THE FIRE.

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.044
WILL THE FIRE WAS THE SINGLE

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.313
LARGEST EVENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.449
FAIR PLAN AS EVER EXPERIENCED.

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:23.218
OTHER WILL THE FIRE ALONE.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:24.920

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:30.792
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.128
THE THREE THOSE THREE EVENTS

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.696
COMBINED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:35.831
WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TWO

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.299
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.468
DOLLARS IN LOSSES.

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.136
AND THOSE THAT NOW KEEP IN MIND

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.738
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.373
REGULAR EVERYDAY LOSSES THAT WE

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.341
GET ON A REGULAR BASIS WE WE GET

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.877
NON CONTESTED LOSSES AS WELL.

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.146
BY COMPARISON THE TOTAL PREMIUM

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.583
WE COLLECTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.952
WAS SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS.

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:57.586
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE JUST FOR

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:58.520
THOSE THREE EVENTS COMPARED TO

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.988
SEVENTY SIX MILLION.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.823
SO IT WAS A IT WAS A BIG

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:02.791
FINANCIAL HIT FOR THE FAIR PLAN

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:03.091
[inaudible]

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:07.129
AND OUR EXPOSURE CONTINUES TO

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.931
GROW IN THESE AREAS SO OUR RATES

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:11.233
HAVE TO REMAIN.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.434
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.703
PAYING THESE LOSSES?

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.506
NOW WHERE WE GROWING -- WE DO

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.374
WITH WE'RE CURRENTLY WRITING THE

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:20.042
TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.643
THE FAIR PLAN THE LAST SIX

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.445
MONTHS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTH

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:25.714
PERIOD WE HAVE GROWN.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.348
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:26.815
FAIR PLAN [inaudible]

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.618
AND YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.552
US REJECT HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.187
TO GROW WE ARE THE INSURER OF

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.188
LAST RESORT WE JUST TAKE

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.456
WHATEVER COMES OUR WAY WE DON'T

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.991
DO MARKETING IN FACT.

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.659
I OFTEN SAY THAT I WORK IN

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:38.727
OPPOSITE WORLD WE TRY TO

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.195
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.564
VOLUNTARY MARKET I SEE ONE OF MY

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.534
MISSIONS IS -- TO CONTINUE TO

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.668
HAVE THE FAIR PLAN SHRINK ITS

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.170
FOOTPRINT.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:50.072
THAT SAID I'M EXPECTING FUTURE

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.473
GROWTH.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.908
I BELIEVE THAT THE FIRE THE

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.242
PRIMARY REASON WE'RE GONNA BE

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.811
GROWING IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.446
COMPANIES ARE.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.281
READJUSTING THEIR PORTFOLIOS AND

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.383
WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.751
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE BUT

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.219
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THEN

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.220
RESPOND TO THE CUSTOMERS THAT DO

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.722
COME OUR WAY.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.491
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THOUGH AS OF

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.660
THE END OF FEBRUARY.

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:12.995
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GROWING AND

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.629
IT'S AGAINST THE FIRST TIME

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:15.163
WE'VE GROWN IN A SIX MONTH

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.566
PERIOD -- IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE

POLICY POLICY COUNTS.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.074

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.677
A WE ARE GROWING IT'S NOT TO THE

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:29.611

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:48.490
PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.425
AS THEIR PRICING OUT RISKY

01:18:50.492 --> 01:19:00.102
LOOKING AT THEIR REST -- A YES.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.671

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.478
INCREASES FROM.

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.745
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.180

LOOKING AT OUR RATES ON AN

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.589
ANNUAL BASIS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:21.556
IN THE MIDST OF DOING RATE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.058
ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW WHICH WILL BE

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.459
SUBMITTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.595

SOON -- LET'S HOPE SO THE THE

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.467
PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T PREDICT

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.101
WHEN THE NEXT CATASTROPHE GONNA

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.336
HAPPEN.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.438
AND YOU KNOW JUST LIKE ON MY

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.839
COLLEAGUE ON PALMER AT THE CA

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:38.974
YOU KNOW WE WE EFFECTIVELY RUN

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.642
CATASTROPHE BUSINESSES SO IT'S

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.977
FEAST OR FAMINE EITHER I'M

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.411
MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:44.913
AND I'M BANKING NOT.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.017
OR I'M PAYING OUT LIKE I DID IN.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:49.651
TWENTY EIGHTEEN I IN WAYS THAT

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:50.418
ARE JUST.

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:51.887
MAKE YOUR MIND SPEND BUT WHAT

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.321
YOU DO IS YOU LOOK AT THE RATES

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.756
OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.591
SO YOU CAN'T LOOK AT JUST LIKE

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.592
US SHORT OF TIME AND SO.

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.127
I'M AN ACTUARIAL STANDPOINT I

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.896
BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:03.298
TO ACTUAL SOUNDNESS -- WITHOUT

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.133
ANOTHER INCREASE OF THE

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.102
MAGNITUDE WE HADN'T TWENTY

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:07.736
EIGHTEEN I JUST WANNA BE REALLY

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:08.603
CLEAR THAT THE ONE THAT'S

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.338
ACTUALLY GOING INTO EFFECT NOW I

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:11.072
DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.040
ANOTHER RATE CHANGE.

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.909
OF THAT MAGNITUDE AGAIN WE HAVE

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:17.312
TO TAKE A VERY LONG TERM VIEW OF

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:18.947
OUR RIGHT.

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.282
YEAH THIS THAT'S QUESTION WILL

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.551
PROBABLY -- JOE MY IGNORANCE

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.451
TERMS OF HOW THE WHOLE THINGS

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:27.255
ARE FUNDED BUT SO BE IT.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.090
DO YOU USE REINSURANCE AS PART

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:30.926
OF THE PROTECTIONS AND

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.961
EVERYTHING FOR THE AIRPLANE WE

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:35.063
DO WE DO BY REINSURANCE I'M NOT

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.198
ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT.

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.299
WHAT MISTER PALMER I BUYS FOR

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.700
THE CA BUT WE DO PURCHASE

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:41.836
REINSURANCE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.873
THAT COST ONE UP BY 67% THIS

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.174
YEAR AND LET ME TELL YOU I'M A

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.342
REALLY GOOD NEGOTIATOR

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:49.611
REINSURANCE AND THAT'S THE BEST

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.212
DEAL I CAN.

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.380
SO CALLED THE REINSURANCE COSTS

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.915

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:57.519
COMPANY COST. FOR THIS PERIL HAS

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.353
GONE THROUGH THE ROOF.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:02.157
SO AM I AM I TEND TO BE ON THE

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.625
LEADING EDGE IN TERMS OF

THE PREMIUM ON THOSE POLICIES

VERY FEW ARE OUR PERSONAL LINES

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.311
INTO AND I MAKE THAT DISTINCTION.

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:03.978
IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:04.512
IS.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.280
LARGELY PERSONAL.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.248
ONE AND SO I WOULD.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.817
A DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.752
DOCUMENT -- DOCUMENT THAT SAYS

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:14.089
THE INSURANCE UNIVERSE.

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:16.157
AND IF YOU GO THROUGH IT.

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.525
THIS IS REALLY JUST WHEN I

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:18.560
WORKED IN GOVERNMENT FIFTEEN

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.161

KNOCKS IT OVER REACTION.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.868
AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.570
THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE WE FAILED

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.804

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:30.939
