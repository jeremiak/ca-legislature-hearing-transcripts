THAT EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE I

THAT'S GOING TO SERVE PURPOSES

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:19.901
OF PROTECTING OUR MOST

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:22.337
VULNERABLE PEOPLE. IN THESE

NURSING HOME FACILITIES SO THIS

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.709

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.180
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN

CALIFORNIA THE TO NOT HAVE

ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF

THEIR RESIDENTS WHEN THE POWER

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:43.058
GOES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ALL TOO

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.759
OFTEN I THINK MANY OF US AS I

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.461
LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM IN OUR

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:52.100
DISTRICTS DURING FIRES. AND

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.336
DURING PS PS EVENTS. THE BILL.

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:57.005
ARE EXCHANGED COMMUNITIES WHO

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.807
HAVE THESE FACILITIES OR WERE

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.575
THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.111
THAT THE FACILITIES MUST HAVE

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:06.781
UP TO NINE OR AT LEAST NINETY

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:09.551
SIX HOURS OF BACKUP GENERATION.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:12.454
I IN CASE OF AN OUTAGE WHETHER

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.257
CAUSED BY A NATURAL DISASTER OR

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:18.827
PS PS AMOUNT. CURRENT

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.261
REGULATIONS IN THE STATE ONLY

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:21.830
REQUIRE NURSING HOMES TO

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.231
PROVIDE VERY LIMITED BACKUP

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:26.568
POWER FOR UP TO SIX HOURS. NOW

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:29.571
THIS IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT AND

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:30.872
A WEAK STANDARD THAT IS TRULY A

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.941
RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:34.743
CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CLIMATE OF

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.711
EXTREME WEATHER. THIS MEASURE

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:39.247
SEEKS TO CODIFY ALREADY

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.683
EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.485
ARE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.654
BUT NOT UNDER STATE LAW. THE

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:47.255
REQUIRED NURSING HOMES TO HAVE

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:49.391
ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF POWER TO

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.226
PROTECT RESIDENTS HEALTH AND

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.328
SAFETY AND MAINTAIN SAFE

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.397
TEMPERATURES I THINK THIS IS

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.298
CRITICAL O NOTE. FOR OUR

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:59.601
SENSITIVE SENIOR POPULATION YOU

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.669
CAN GET EXTREMELY HOT VERY

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.638
DIFFICULT FOR SOME SENIORS TO

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.875
BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THAT HE'D-

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:11.913
IT ALSO PROVIDES BACKUP POWER.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.414
FOR PARKS ENGINE AND FOR

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.715
MEDICINE THAT NEED TO BE CAP AT

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:16.384
AN APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE. SO

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.585
THESE ARE ALREADY EXISTING

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.421
FEDERAL STANDARDS TO WHICH

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.356
ALMOST ALL OF CALIFORNIA

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:23.358
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:26.594
SUBJECTED TO. BUT FOR THOSE MET

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:29.364
THOSE ARE NURSING HOMES TO COME

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.299
UNDER STATE REGULATION. THEY

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.401
ONLY NOW ARE REQUIRED TO

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:37.705
MAINTAIN SIX HOURS. THIS AGAIN

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:41.509
MERELY CODIFIES THE FEDERAL

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.343
STANDARD INTO STATE LAW AND

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.447
ADDRESSES A SMALL NUMBER OF

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:48.183
THESE HOMES HOWEVER THIS BILL

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.884
THANKS TO AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.553
WORKED ON WITH YOU SHOULD FOR

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:54.422
SOME REASON FEDERAL REGULATIONS

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:58.293
BE CHANGED OR ELIMINATED. THOSE

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.462
STANDARDS WILL BECOME THE LAW

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:02.831
OF CALIFORNIA YOUR RESPECTIVE

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.098
OF WHETHER THE FEDERAL

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:05.266
GOVERNMENT ACTS TO REMOVE THEM

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:08.803
OR NOT. OF HI I DON'T NEED I

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:11.739
THINK TO EXPLAIN ANY FURTHER

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.976
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS IN AN ERA

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.211
OF COVERT WHEN OUR SENIORS ARE

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:19.214
UNDER SUCH STRESS IN PARTICULAR

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.149
NURSING HOMES PEOPLE IN THOSE

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:24.052
HOMES ARE SUBJECT. TO THESE

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:26.521
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS NOW THE

IN PLACE DURING THESE PSP ****

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:41.002
OR DURING WILDFIRES BECAUSE OF

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:43.404
THE DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATE WITH

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:45.306
MOVING HESE FOLKS AND THE

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:47.909
ISSUES OF CONGREGATE CARE SO IT

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.411
BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:52.046

THOSE DOWN TO GET THE REVENUE

04:18:34.232 --> 04:18:36.434
INTO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO

04:18:36.500 --> 04:18:37.201
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE VERY

04:18:37.268 --> 04:18:40.404

ANNOYANCE IS THAT THE BILL IS

04:20:11.529 --> 04:20:12.797
INDICATIVE OF A TREND THAT I

SMOKING ADDICTION MUCH LIKE

04:20:22.506 --> 04:20:25.009

WE KNOW THERE IS A DIRECT

04:21:21.866 --> 04:21:24.235
CORRELATION BETWEEN POVERTY AND

04:21:24.301 --> 04:21:24.735

INCENTIVIZING BETTER CHOICES.

04:22:15.419 --> 04:22:17.288

WHILE WE SIT HERE AND LAUNCH

04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:20.391

REST OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE I

04:26:39.116 --> 04:26:40.284
WOULD SAY THERE'S A PROBABLY A

04:26:40.351 --> 04:26:42.119
BIG CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE WHO

04:26:42.186 --> 04:26:45.723

FOR ANY OF THAT. BUT I DO THINK

04:29:50.173 --> 04:29:50.974
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG

04:29:51.041 --> 04:29:52.743
IN OUR SYSTEM WOULD HAVE IF YOU

ABLE TO DIGEST. I BRING THAT UP

04:31:26.169 --> 04:31:27.304
BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS BEEN

04:31:27.371 --> 04:31:30.607
MOVED- AND BROUGHT TO THIS

04:31:30.674 --> 04:31:33.377
HOUSE FOR US TO VOTE ON- IN AND

04:31:33.443 --> 04:31:35.145
IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I

04:31:35.212 --> 04:31:36.913
DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYONE IN

04:31:36.980 --> 04:31:38.415
THIS FLOOR RIGHT NOW OR IN BOTH

04:31:38.482 --> 04:31:40.951
HOUSES. THAT AGREE WITH THE

04:31:41.018 --> 04:31:43.453
CRISIS ON YOUTH KEEPING

04:31:43.520 --> 04:31:45.355
EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THAT MOVE

04:31:45.422 --> 04:31:46.623
FORWARD I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO

04:31:46.690 --> 04:31:49.459
ANYONE MEMBER. IN EITHER HOUSE

04:31:49.526 --> 04:31:51.061
AND IN EITHER PARTY OR ONE

04:31:51.128 --> 04:31:54.865
PARTY. THAT DISAGREES WITH. I

04:31:54.931 --> 04:31:56.800
BUT THIS IDEA THAT ONLY BECAUSE

04:31:56.867 --> 04:31:59.970
THIS IS A- POLICY COMMITTEE.

04:32:00.037 --> 04:32:02.472
DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT

04:32:02.539 --> 04:32:04.675
WE WILL NOT THINK ABOUT THE

04:32:04.741 --> 04:32:06.843
FISCAL IMPACT JUST SEEMS A

04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:10.280
LITTLE. UNORTHODOX AND A

04:32:10.347 --> 04:32:13.050
LITTLE- NARROW MINDED NEXT

04:32:13.116 --> 04:32:16.520
YEAR. WE WILL BE FACED WITH AN

04:32:16.586 --> 04:32:19.623
MASSIVE REVENUE LOSS WE WILL BE

04:32:19.690 --> 04:32:21.625
ASKED TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

04:32:21.692 --> 04:32:24.061
THINGS TO CUT. I THINK THAT MY

04:32:24.127 --> 04:32:25.495
COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE EXPRESSED

04:32:25.562 --> 04:32:26.963
THOSE CONCERNS ARE ALREADY

04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:29.032
THINKING ABOUT THAT. SO NEXT

04:32:29.099 --> 04:32:30.400
YEAR WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

04:32:30.467 --> 04:32:32.803
BUDGET. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

04:32:32.869 --> 04:32:35.338
THINK OKAY DO WE CUT FUNDS FROM

04:32:35.405 --> 04:32:37.641
CHILD CARE. DO WE CUT FUNDS

04:32:37.708 --> 04:32:40.510
FROM TEACHERS NURSES I JUST

04:32:40.577 --> 04:32:41.878
THAT'S PROGRAM WHICH HELPS

04:32:41.945 --> 04:32:42.679
SENIORS AND THOSE ITH

04:32:42.746 --> 04:32:45.315
DISABILITIES. THOSE ARE REAL

04:32:45.382 --> 04:32:45.916
CUTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:32:45.982 --> 04:32:47.884
TO FACE. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

04:32:47.951 --> 04:32:49.619
MILLION MAY SEEM LIKE A DROP IN

04:32:49.686 --> 04:32:50.987
THE BUCKET IN A BUDGET THAT'S

04:32:51.054 --> 04:32:53.156
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT FOR

04:32:53.223 --> 04:32:55.258
NONPROFITS AND FOR OUR

MYSELF IN A VERY STRANGE

04:33:01.832 --> 04:33:03.500

04:33:26.656 --> 04:33:29.793
QUITE FRANKLY A PRIVILEGE. TO

04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:31.528
BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS. SO

WHEN YOUR RESPONSE ME WHEN I AM

04:33:33.330 --> 04:33:34.998
ASKING THE QUESTION IS WHY

US. I HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH

04:33:45.642 --> 04:33:47.177
SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING POLICY.

04:33:47.244 --> 04:33:50.180
THAT MAKES SENSE. SO I'M GLAD

04:33:50.247 --> 04:33:51.014
AND GRATEFUL FOR THE

04:33:51.081 --> 04:33:52.415
CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE HAD

04:33:52.482 --> 04:33:53.316
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY

04:33:53.383 --> 04:33:56.353
CHALLENGING BILL TO A LOT OF

04:33:56.419 --> 04:33:57.454
PEOPLE FOR THE- ISSUES THAT

04:33:57.521 --> 04:33:58.989
HAVE ALREADY BEEN A- I THINK

04:33:59.055 --> 04:34:01.558
THE VAPING ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY

04:34:01.625 --> 04:34:03.226
IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS WE

04:34:03.293 --> 04:34:06.096
HAD A BILL. IN THIS HOUSE. THAT

04:34:06.163 --> 04:34:07.864
WAS REFERRED TO A DIFFERENT

04:34:07.931 --> 04:34:10.267
COMMITTEE THAT WAS REFERRED-

04:34:10.333 --> 04:34:11.768
I'M SORRY THAT DID NOT GET

04:34:11.835 --> 04:34:14.204
REFERRED. ON THE SENATE SIDE-

04:34:14.271 --> 04:34:15.906
THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESS SOME OF

04:34:15.972 --> 04:34:17.274
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE

04:34:17.340 --> 04:34:19.109
THINKING ABOUT FROM A MEMBER OF

04:34:19.176 --> 04:34:21.077
THIS HOUSE. AND I'VE HAD TO

04:34:21.144 --> 04:34:23.146
EXPLAIN TO SOME FOLKS. SOME

04:34:23.213 --> 04:34:25.015
TERMINOLOGY THAT IS USED ON THE

04:34:25.081 --> 04:34:26.950
STREET IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A

04:34:27.017 --> 04:34:30.554
BLUNT. I HAVE TO I HAVE A

04:34:30.620 --> 04:34:32.422
COUPLE OF MEMBERS AND- THEY

04:34:32.489 --> 04:34:35.792
DIDN'T KNOW. SO WHEN WE ARE

04:34:35.859 --> 04:34:37.928
TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S A LITTLE

04:34:37.994 --> 04:34:40.297
FUNNY MAYBE BUT WE'RE TALKING

04:34:40.363 --> 04:34:42.332
ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU

04:34:42.399 --> 04:34:43.934
KNOW I THINK IT YOUR WHATEVER

04:34:44.000 --> 04:34:45.769
THAT IS USED BY YOUNG PEOPLE

04:34:45.836 --> 04:34:47.404
AND ADULTS THAT HAVE CLEARED

04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:51.875
OUT AND THEN YOU PUT A CANNABIS

04:34:51.942 --> 04:34:54.644
AND IT. OR WE'D IN IT RIGHT.

04:34:54.711 --> 04:34:56.346
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SMOKING

04:34:56.413 --> 04:34:57.614
A CIGARETTE THE OTHER SMOKING A

04:34:57.681 --> 04:34:59.783
BLUNT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE

04:34:59.850 --> 04:35:01.685
WAY THAT SOCIETY WORKS. AND THE

04:35:01.751 --> 04:35:02.886
FACT THAT WE ARE PASSING

04:35:02.953 --> 04:35:07.224
LEGISLATION. ON TOBACCO- AND

04:35:07.290 --> 04:35:09.359
NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT IS THAT

04:35:09.426 --> 04:35:12.329
PEOPLE USE IT. IS JUST MIND

04:35:12.395 --> 04:35:14.531
BOGGLING TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVE

04:35:14.598 --> 04:35:15.832
TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE

04:35:15.899 --> 04:35:18.068
PEOPLE BEYOND. THIS CAPITOL

04:35:18.134 --> 04:35:20.437
THIS BUILDING. THAT ARE GOING

04:35:20.503 --> 04:35:23.340
TO BE LOOKING TO US THINKING

04:35:23.406 --> 04:35:25.208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING. BUT THERE

04:35:25.275 --> 04:35:27.444
IS A BIGGER THERE IS A BIGGER

04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:30.413
GOAL- I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED WE

04:35:30.480 --> 04:35:31.748
HAVEN'T INCLUDED FLAVORED

04:35:31.815 --> 04:35:33.850
CANNABIS IN THIS CONVERSATION

04:35:33.917 --> 04:35:36.453
BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING.

04:35:36.519 --> 04:35:38.321
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE USING BUT

04:35:38.388 --> 04:35:40.490
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VAPING AND

04:35:40.557 --> 04:35:41.324
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOBACCO NOW

04:35:41.391 --> 04:35:43.894
I HOPE THE MOMENTUM. FOR FEVER

04:35:43.960 --> 04:35:45.595
CANNABIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT

04:35:45.662 --> 04:35:47.163
WE CAN LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE.

04:35:47.230 --> 04:35:49.499
BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO AN ISSUE

04:35:49.566 --> 04:35:51.401
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR

04:35:51.468 --> 04:35:53.470
BATHROOMS AT HIGH SCHOOLS THAT

04:35:53.536 --> 04:35:55.305
I HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY. FROM

04:35:55.372 --> 04:35:56.339
YOUNG STUDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY

04:35:56.406 --> 04:35:59.743
AND MY DISTRICT ON THE OVER. A

04:35:59.809 --> 04:36:01.578
CELL IS ILLEGAL CANNABIS

04:36:01.645 --> 04:36:04.314
DISPENSARY IS THAT JUST POP IN

04:36:04.381 --> 04:36:05.949
IN AND OUT. AND SO IF THE ISSUE

04:36:06.016 --> 04:36:08.685
REALLY IS TO ADDRESS. TEEN

04:36:08.752 --> 04:36:10.787
VAPING AND TEEN CONSUMPTION

04:36:10.854 --> 04:36:11.655
THEN I HOPE THAT THAT'S A

04:36:11.721 --> 04:36:13.456
CONVERSATION AND THE POLITICAL

04:36:13.523 --> 04:36:14.624
COURAGE THAT WE CAN ALSO

04:36:14.691 --> 04:36:16.393
INCLUDE ONE LOOK AT.

04:36:16.459 --> 04:36:19.029
LEGISLATION IN THE FUTURE SO

HOLISTIC WAY IN WHICH WE DO

04:36:37.247 --> 04:36:39.149
POLICY AND A HOLISTIC WAY IN

04:36:39.215 --> 04:36:41.651
WHICH WE LOOK AT HOW THE BUDGET

04:36:41.718 --> 04:36:42.719

VAPING. I DO FIND IT

04:37:29.866 --> 04:37:31.501

ARCHITECT OPTED FOR MEMBERS TO

HAVE BEEN A WITNESS IN SUPPORT

04:44:11.567 --> 04:44:14.537
OF THIS HE WAS HE WAS NOT. HE

04:44:14.604 --> 04:44:16.739

THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

04:44:18.107 --> 04:44:19.275

04:44:22.145 --> 04:44:23.446
I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. THIS

04:44:23.513 --> 04:44:25.381
BILL DOES NOT CRIMINALIZE THIS

04:44:25.448 --> 04:44:26.883
WE HAD A BILL BEFORE US LAST

04:44:26.949 --> 04:44:29.218
YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT

04:44:29.285 --> 04:44:31.687
DID PRIOR TO MY AMENDMENTS THAT

04:44:31.754 --> 04:44:33.089
PULLED ALL THE CRIMINALIZATION

04:44:33.156 --> 04:44:34.891
ITEMS OUT OF THAT. WE HAD A

04:44:34.957 --> 04:44:36.893
MEMBER WHO WANTED TO

04:44:36.959 --> 04:44:38.895
CRIMINALIZE. THIS ISSUE AND I

04:44:38.961 --> 04:44:42.665
PULL THAT OUT. THIS BILL DOES

04:44:42.732 --> 04:44:45.635
NOT CRIMINALIZE THIS ISSUE. IT

04:44:45.701 --> 04:44:46.936
DOES NOT DO THAT AND I THINK

04:44:47.003 --> 04:44:50.306
IT'S A RED HERRING AND I AND TO

04:44:50.373 --> 04:44:52.375
IMPLY THAT IT DOES IS NOT NOT

04:44:52.442 --> 04:44:53.109
CORRECT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

04:44:53.176 --> 04:44:55.311
AUTHOR IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOES

04:44:55.378 --> 04:44:57.713
YEP MAGIC MIGHT CREATE A BLACK

04:44:57.780 --> 04:44:59.949
MARKET WE DON'T KNOW IS THAT A

04:45:00.016 --> 04:45:01.150
POSSIBILITY. WE DON'T KNOW.

04:45:01.217 --> 04:45:03.386
THIS STILL SOMEONE COULD STILL

04:45:03.453 --> 04:45:05.388
BUY THESE PRODUCTS ONLINE. IF

04:45:05.455 --> 04:45:06.923
THEY HAVE TO DO IT AND THEY

04:45:06.989 --> 04:45:08.424
COULD STILL BUY IT ONLINE THIS

04:45:08.491 --> 04:45:10.460
DOES NOT RESTRICT THAT. BUT IT

04:45:10.526 --> 04:45:13.095
DOES. PREVENT THE ATTRACTIVE

04:45:13.162 --> 04:45:15.264
NUISANCE. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

04:45:15.331 --> 04:45:16.966
WANT TO SPONTANEOUSLY FIND A

04:45:17.033 --> 04:45:18.000
WAY TO GET A PRODUCT IN A

04:45:18.067 --> 04:45:19.769
CONVENIENCE STORE. THAT'S THE

04:45:19.836 --> 04:45:23.206
GOAL HERE AND SO I THOUGHT I'D

04:45:23.272 --> 04:45:23.739
AND THAT IS MY DEPARTMENT

04:45:23.806 --> 04:45:25.508
THAT'S MY BUT I. YOU KNOW AND

04:45:25.575 --> 04:45:27.677
YOU KNOW NO AND I EVERY DRIVERS

04:45:27.743 --> 04:45:29.178
STRUCTURE OPINION ON. THIS AND

04:45:29.245 --> 04:45:31.481
I DO WORRY THOUGH BECAUSE IF WE

04:45:31.547 --> 04:45:33.683
STILL CAN BUY ONLINE AS WELL AS

04:45:33.749 --> 04:45:34.517
CASINOS I THINK IS IN THE BILL

04:45:34.584 --> 04:45:36.619
AS WELL CORRECT. WE DO NOT HAVE

04:45:36.686 --> 04:45:37.920
THE AUTHORITY OVER SOVEREIGN

04:45:37.987 --> 04:45:40.490
NATIONS SO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:45:40.556 --> 04:45:41.991
PEOPLE RUNNING UP TO WHEREVER

04:45:42.058 --> 04:45:44.794
OR BUYING ONLINE. CARTONS AT A

04:45:44.861 --> 04:45:46.329
TIME. AND SELL THEM ON STREET

04:45:46.395 --> 04:45:48.297
CORNERS LIKE THAT IS A CONCERN

04:45:48.364 --> 04:45:49.198
BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS

04:45:49.265 --> 04:45:51.334
ACCESS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

04:45:51.400 --> 04:45:53.302
COMMUNITIES DO ALL THE STUFF.

04:45:53.369 --> 04:45:56.105
SO THERE IS A CONCERN TO THIS-

04:45:56.172 --> 04:45:57.373
AND I WILL I'VE BEEN TALKING TO

04:45:57.440 --> 04:45:58.908

FOR THAT THE WORK WE DO HERE IS

04:46:03.880 --> 04:46:05.915
NEVER CARVED IN STONE. AND IF

04:46:05.982 --> 04:46:07.683
THERE AREN'T UNINTENDED

04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:09.552
CONSEQUENCES I FULLY HOPE THAT

04:46:09.619 --> 04:46:11.854
THIS BODY. SENATE WILL BENEFIT

04:46:11.921 --> 04:46:13.823
THE CONSEQUENCES- BUT AT THIS

04:46:13.890 --> 04:46:15.458
POINT I WOULD HAVE TO STATE

04:46:15.525 --> 04:46:18.327
IT'S SOMEWHAT HYPOTHETICAL

04:46:18.394 --> 04:46:18.961
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A OF THAT

04:46:19.028 --> 04:46:20.930
DONE EVERYTHING. SUCH THAT

04:46:20.997 --> 04:46:23.232

DEBATE AND REAL CONVERSATION

04:46:50.493 --> 04:46:52.495

04:46:54.564 --> 04:46:55.932
THE WAY THAT WE HAD TO OPERATE-

FROM SEPT TO BROUGHT THIS TO

04:50:48.497 --> 04:50:55.604
SOME OF ISSUES WHY IT. WE AND

04:50:55.671 --> 04:50:56.906
YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF HOW CAN

04:50:56.972 --> 04:50:59.208
SOMEONE SINCE PURCHASE IF

04:50:59.275 --> 04:51:00.576
YOU'RE A MINOR A PRODUCT THAT

04:51:00.643 --> 04:51:02.444
YOU CAN'T BUY IT FOR TWENTY ONE

04:51:02.511 --> 04:51:04.413
YEARS OLD. BUT THE RECENT

04:51:04.480 --> 04:51:06.148
SURVEYS THAT WERE DONE SHOWED

04:51:06.215 --> 04:51:10.519
THAT 74% OR 71% OF THOSE. WHO

04:51:10.586 --> 04:51:13.088
PURCHASED JUHL PODS AND JUUL

04:51:13.155 --> 04:51:15.658
PRODUCTS WERE UNDER THAT. 71%

04:51:15.724 --> 04:51:17.359
WERE ABLE TO BUY IN A STORE

04:51:17.426 --> 04:51:19.261
WHERE IT WAS. ILLEGAL TO

04:51:19.328 --> 04:51:20.796
PURCHASE THOSE PRODUCTS. AND

04:51:20.863 --> 04:51:22.031
WHEN HAVE STING OPERATIONS BY

04:51:22.097 --> 04:51:23.232
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

04:51:23.299 --> 04:51:26.735
PUBLIC HEALTH THEY FIND IT 50%

04:51:26.802 --> 04:51:29.438
IS WHAT THE- BY RATE HAS BEEN

04:51:29.505 --> 04:51:31.373
WITH THOSE MINERS SO WHATEVER

04:51:31.440 --> 04:51:33.042
WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING. SO

04:51:33.108 --> 04:51:34.810
THE IDEA OF TRYING TO FIND A

04:51:34.877 --> 04:51:37.580
WAY TO STOP. BIG TOBACCO FROM

04:51:37.646 --> 04:51:40.282

04:51:49.291 --> 04:51:51.460
NINE POINT ONE PERCENT. ALCOHOL

04:51:51.527 --> 04:51:53.462
IS ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT 4% OF

04:51:53.529 --> 04:51:57.032
USE. TOBACCO THIRTY ONE POINT

04:51:57.099 --> 04:52:00.035
9% ADDICTIVE REYES SAID THAT'S

04:52:00.102 --> 04:52:02.338
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND

04:52:02.404 --> 04:52:03.505
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

04:52:03.572 --> 04:52:04.673
AVERAGE IN THE BEGINNING AGE OF

04:52:04.740 --> 04:52:08.210

04:52:10.212 --> 04:52:11.981
DRAGONESS AT WHATEVER COLLEGE

04:52:12.047 --> 04:52:12.882

HAD THE COOLNESS OF PEOPLE. OR

04:52:20.155 --> 04:52:21.790
THAT MEANT WHICH IS WHAT THE

04:52:21.857 --> 04:52:23.058
FOR WITH THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE

04:52:23.125 --> 04:52:24.093
ATTRACTING THEM THAT'S WHAT'S

04:52:24.159 --> 04:52:26.028

TODAY- MY EXPERIENCE AND HAVE

04:54:13.435 --> 04:54:15.037
LEARNED ABOUT THE HOOKAH AND

04:54:15.104 --> 04:54:15.571
THE CULTURE OF SURROUNDING

04:54:15.637 --> 04:54:18.474
HOOKAH- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

04:54:18.540 --> 04:54:20.309

BEFORE I. WENT TO REGARD THE

04:54:25.147 --> 04:54:26.882
PREMIUM CIGARS WHICH WE THINK

04:54:26.949 --> 04:54:29.752
REALLY ONLY. ARE USING PREMIUM

04:54:29.818 --> 04:54:31.086
CIGARS. WE'VE ALSO GOT AN

04:54:31.153 --> 04:54:35.791
EXEMPTION FOR A PIPE THE- LOOSE

LEAF PIPE TO BE AT IT'S IS IT'S

04:54:37.359 --> 04:54:39.161
CRAFTED. SO THE QUESTION THAT I

04:54:39.228 --> 04:54:41.563
HAVE IS WE'VE EXEMPTED HOOKAH.

04:54:41.630 --> 04:54:43.732
WE'VE EXEMPTED PIPE THAT

AND PREMIUM CIGARS FROM THIS

04:54:49.772 --> 04:54:53.575
BAND. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

04:54:53.642 --> 04:54:56.045
THAT NEEDS TO BE EXEMPTED THAT.

04:54:56.111 --> 04:54:57.913
WE KNOW ABOUT THAT MAKE. MORE

04:54:57.980 --> 04:54:59.782
RIGHT. THE GOALIE. IS THE WITH

04:54:59.848 --> 04:55:01.517
KIDS RIGHT WE WANT TO STOP KIDS

04:55:01.583 --> 04:55:03.285
FROM GETTING HOOKED ON THIS.

04:55:03.352 --> 04:55:04.987
BUT THERE ARE PRODUCTS TOBACCO

04:55:05.054 --> 04:55:08.690
PRODUCTS THAT ADULTS USE ARE

04:55:08.757 --> 04:55:09.725
THERE UP PRODUCT WE SHOULD ALL

04:55:09.792 --> 04:55:10.993
PUT IN. TO MAKE THIS BILL A

04:55:11.060 --> 04:55:14.096
BETTER BILL I'M NOT AWARE. IN

04:55:14.163 --> 04:55:15.297
THE ISSUE AT THE EXIT. AND WHAT

04:55:15.364 --> 04:55:20.903
WHAT CONVERT THAT. I'VE HAD

04:55:20.969 --> 04:55:21.870
WITH SOME OF THE MEN. THIS

04:55:21.937 --> 04:55:23.305
COMMITTEE AND WHERE THE- SHINJI

04:55:23.372 --> 04:55:24.373
AVAILABLE WE DO HEARD ABOUT

04:55:24.440 --> 04:55:26.141
TODAY YOU HAVE TO WAIT RISKS

04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:27.676
WHAT IS THE OF YOUTH GETTING

04:55:27.743 --> 04:55:29.445
THAT PRODUCT AND BECOMING

04:55:29.511 --> 04:55:33.082
ADDICTED TO IT AND THEN HOOK A

04:55:33.148 --> 04:55:34.616
VERY LIMITED IN LOW RISK. S.

04:55:34.683 --> 04:55:36.685
PREMIUM CIGARS OVER TWELVE

04:55:36.752 --> 04:55:38.954
DOLLARS VERY LOW RISK. AND WHEN

04:55:39.021 --> 04:55:41.156
YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA PACKAGE

04:55:41.223 --> 04:55:44.460
FOR- TOBACCO GROUND TOBACCO OR

04:55:44.526 --> 04:55:47.329
RELIEF TOBACCO. IT FOR PIPES

04:55:47.396 --> 04:55:49.231
ANOTHER VERY LOW RISK AND IT

04:55:49.298 --> 04:55:50.833
WILL BE CRAFTED I BELIEVE IN A

04:55:50.899 --> 04:55:52.901
WAY THAT WILL NOT INSTANCE.

04:55:52.968 --> 04:55:55.337
INCENTIVIZE THE USE IN OTHER

04:55:55.404 --> 04:55:58.540
TYPES OR FORMS OF- OF PRODUCTS

04:55:58.607 --> 04:56:01.777
SO I LOOK AT THE RISK FACTOR IN

04:56:01.844 --> 04:56:02.945
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT

04:56:03.011 --> 04:56:04.179
TO ME AND WAS CERTAINLY THE

04:56:04.246 --> 04:56:07.282

04:59:43.398 --> 04:59:45.233

THANKS TO THE AUTHOR FOR

05:00:02.351 --> 05:00:03.985
BRINGING THIS. IMPORTANT BILL

05:00:04.052 --> 05:00:06.588
FORD. FOLKS I'LL BE VERY CANDID

05:00:06.655 --> 05:00:08.190
WITH YOU I'M NOT SO CONFLICTED

05:00:08.256 --> 05:00:09.891
ABOUT THIS AT ALL. I THINK

05:00:09.958 --> 05:00:11.927
THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO

05:00:11.993 --> 05:00:14.596
DO. I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES

05:00:14.663 --> 05:00:15.130
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ARE

05:00:15.197 --> 05:00:17.699
EXTREMELY VALID. BUT MAYBE MY

05:00:17.766 --> 05:00:19.167
PERSPECTIVE IS VERY DIFFERENT.

05:00:19.234 --> 05:00:22.404
I GREW WHEN MY FAMILY WAS

05:00:22.471 --> 05:00:24.806
SEPARATED DURING THE WAR IN

05:00:24.873 --> 05:00:28.043
IRAN AND WE HAD TO MY MOTHER

05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:28.643
AND I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

05:00:28.710 --> 05:00:30.912
COME HERE. AT THE AGE OF EIGHT

05:00:30.979 --> 05:00:33.081
I SAW MY MOTHER STRUGGLING WITH

05:00:33.148 --> 05:00:35.550
THE LEVEL OF STRESS. HAVING TWO

05:00:35.617 --> 05:00:37.719
CHILDREN HERE ONE CHILD IN A

05:00:37.786 --> 05:00:40.021
THIRD COUNTRY AND HER HUSBAND

05:00:40.088 --> 05:00:41.556
IN YET A THIRD COUNTRY. WE WERE

05:00:41.623 --> 05:00:43.458
SEPARATE INTO THREE CONTINENTS

05:00:43.525 --> 05:00:45.227
AND THAT STRESS OF NOT KNOWING

05:00:45.293 --> 05:00:47.295
WHERE THINGS WERE GONNA GO

05:00:47.362 --> 05:00:47.863
WHILE SHE WAS WORKING THREE

05:00:47.929 --> 05:00:51.032
JOBS. SHE STARTED SMOKING. SHE

05:00:51.099 --> 05:00:53.034
WOULD FINISH A PACK A DAY. THAT

05:00:53.101 --> 05:00:56.238
I WOULD FIND THE PACKS AND

05:00:56.304 --> 05:01:00.075
THROWN AWAY. AT EIGHT. I'M GLAD

05:01:00.142 --> 05:01:02.544
I DIDN'T GET HOOKED ON IT.

05:01:02.611 --> 05:01:04.112
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WHAT IT DOES

05:01:04.179 --> 05:01:05.947
TO FEEL WE ALL HAVE FRIENDS WHO

05:01:06.014 --> 05:01:07.482
HAVE WITNESSED WHAT'S HAPPENED

05:01:07.549 --> 05:01:12.821
TO THEM. SO I CAN'T SHARE THAT

05:01:12.888 --> 05:01:15.257
I'M I DON'T SAY IT LIGHTLY BUT

05:01:15.323 --> 05:01:16.258
I CAN'T SHARE THAT I'M

05:01:16.324 --> 05:01:18.860
CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS. ANYTHING

05:01:18.927 --> 05:01:20.962
I WAS HAVING TOUGH TIME.

05:01:21.029 --> 05:01:22.431
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE GAMES

05:01:22.497 --> 05:01:25.200
MANSHIP THAT'S BEEN GOING ON

05:01:25.267 --> 05:01:25.967
BETWEEN OUR TWO HOUSES. THAT'S

05:01:26.034 --> 05:01:31.173
BEEN EMBARRASSING THIS PANDEMIC.

05:01:31.239 --> 05:01:31.740
WHEN WE SHOULD BE ADVANCING

05:01:31.807 --> 05:01:32.607
STRAW BILL THAT HOW THE

05:01:32.674 --> 05:01:34.676
LEGISLATURE IS WORKING ON

05:01:34.743 --> 05:01:37.679
BEHALF OF ITS CONSTITUENTS. IT

05:01:37.746 --> 05:01:40.949
WHICH EACH OTHER'S BILLS. AND

05:01:41.016 --> 05:01:41.550
IT'S NOT EVEN PARTISAN BY THE

05:01:41.616 --> 05:01:44.019
WAY. IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF

05:01:44.085 --> 05:01:46.521
IT WAS REPUBLICAN ON DEMOCRATS

05:01:46.588 --> 05:01:47.155
IT'S DEMOCRATS DOING IT TO EACH

05:01:47.222 --> 05:01:50.992
OTHER. MORE TO COME ON THAT

05:01:51.059 --> 05:01:52.360
LATER BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE

05:01:52.427 --> 05:01:54.296

05:01:54.362 --> 05:01:57.365

05:01:58.733 --> 05:02:00.469
BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I THINK

05:02:00.535 --> 05:02:01.803
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO

05:02:01.870 --> 05:02:03.071
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME VALID

05:02:03.138 --> 05:02:04.906
POINTS BROUGHT UP ABOUT HOW

05:02:04.973 --> 05:02:08.477
THIS IMPACTS CB. AND SOME OTHER

05:02:08.543 --> 05:02:10.245
SOME OTHER AREAS THAT WE NEED

05:02:10.312 --> 05:02:13.014
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON. BUT I'M

05:02:13.081 --> 05:02:14.516
GOING TO BE PROUD TO JOIN YOU

05:02:14.583 --> 05:02:18.186

05:02:49.217 --> 05:02:51.353
THOSE ARE NUMBERS WE CAN

05:02:51.419 --> 05:02:52.787
ACCOUNT FOR RIGHT. BUT WHAT

05:02:52.854 --> 05:02:54.222
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE

05:02:54.289 --> 05:02:57.359

AHEAD OF US AND I'LL DO MY BEST

05:06:39.414 --> 05:06:40.682
TO BE BRIEF BUT I DO HAVE SOME

05:06:40.749 --> 05:06:42.550
POINTS I WANT TO MAKE. YOU KNOW

05:06:42.617 --> 05:06:44.486
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

05:06:44.552 --> 05:06:46.020
SAYS THE TOBACCO KILLS MORE

05:06:46.087 --> 05:06:47.222
THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A

05:06:47.288 --> 05:06:50.658
YEAR. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE.

05:06:50.725 --> 05:06:53.428
IT'S THE MOST DEADLY. CONSUMER

05:06:53.495 --> 05:06:57.432
PRODUCT EVER MADE. PERIOD THE

05:06:57.499 --> 05:06:59.701
CDC SAYS THE TOBACCO COMPANIES

05:06:59.768 --> 05:07:01.603
TO FIND ON THE WEBSITE ADD

05:07:01.669 --> 05:07:03.338
MENTHOL TO MAKE CIGARETTES SEEM

05:07:03.404 --> 05:07:06.775
LESS HARSH AND MORE APPEALING

05:07:06.841 --> 05:07:07.375
TO NEW SPOKES MOTORS IN YOUNG

05:07:07.442 --> 05:07:10.779
PEOPLE. THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE

05:07:10.845 --> 05:07:13.148
ISSUE HERE IS TRYING TO NOT

05:07:13.214 --> 05:07:15.583
HAVE THE NEXT GENERATION HOOKED

05:07:15.650 --> 05:07:18.419
ON A DEADLY PRODUCT. SO I LOOK

05:07:18.486 --> 05:07:20.789
AT THIS IN MY MIND AS AS A

05:07:20.855 --> 05:07:22.624
PREVENTIVE MEASURE AND WHEN YOU

05:07:22.690 --> 05:07:24.325
DO PREVENTION IT'S AN

05:07:24.392 --> 05:07:27.729
INVESTMENT. TO REAP THE FUTURE

05:07:27.796 --> 05:07:29.764
REWARD AND THEIR FUTURE AWARD

05:07:29.831 --> 05:07:31.933
IS A REDUCTION IN THE THREE

05:07:32.000 --> 05:07:33.401
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A

05:07:33.468 --> 05:07:36.504
YEAR WE SPEND. ON MEDIC CAL ON

05:07:36.571 --> 05:07:38.573
SMOKING RELATED ILLNESSES.

05:07:38.640 --> 05:07:41.576
THINK ABOUT THAT SO YES WE WILL

05:07:41.643 --> 05:07:44.546
HAVE A SHORTFALL HERE. BUT IS

05:07:44.612 --> 05:07:47.348
IT BETTER TO ALLOW AN INDUSTRY

05:07:47.415 --> 05:07:49.951
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING

05:07:50.018 --> 05:07:52.320
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.

05:07:52.387 --> 05:07:54.355
SOME SLACK SO THAT WE HAVE A

05:07:54.422 --> 05:07:58.092
COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

05:07:58.159 --> 05:07:59.994
A YEAR MORE IN IN REVENUE OKAY.

05:08:00.061 --> 05:08:01.896
IS THAT THE TRADE OFF HERE.

05:08:01.963 --> 05:08:03.364
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN FIND A

05:08:03.431 --> 05:08:04.666
COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

05:08:04.732 --> 05:08:07.268
QUITE FRANKLY IF THAT'S WHAT IT

05:08:07.335 --> 05:08:09.838
TRULY WORKS OUT TO BE. SO THIS

05:08:09.904 --> 05:08:11.906
ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME.

05:08:11.973 --> 05:08:14.676
MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL CAREER.

05:08:14.742 --> 05:08:16.077
HAS BEEN ABOUT TRYING TO HELP

05:08:16.144 --> 05:08:20.281
PEOPLE STOP SMOKING. I WATCHED

05:08:20.348 --> 05:08:21.182
MY GRANDMOTHER IN A NURSING

05:08:21.249 --> 05:08:23.818
HOME. WITH CRIPPLING RHEUMATOID

05:08:23.885 --> 05:08:27.789
ARTHRITIS. SMOKING METHYLATED

05:08:27.856 --> 05:08:29.390
CIGARETTES WHEN SHE COULD

05:08:29.457 --> 05:08:31.226
BARELY LIKE THAT BECAUSE SHE

05:08:31.292 --> 05:08:34.295
WAS SO CRIPPLED UP. HE DIED. OF

05:08:34.362 --> 05:08:38.633
CANCER I WATCHED MY GRANDFATHER

05:08:38.700 --> 05:08:40.902
ROLLING HIS OWN CIGARETTES AND

05:08:40.969 --> 05:08:42.871
BEING FASCINATED BY IT. TO

05:08:42.937 --> 05:08:48.409
WATCH HIM DIE OF A HEART ATTACK.

05:08:48.476 --> 05:08:50.778
IT'S DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. I

05:08:50.845 --> 05:08:52.347
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY YOUNG

05:08:52.413 --> 05:08:54.115
PEOPLE I SAW ON MY PRACTICE

05:08:54.182 --> 05:08:56.584
COME IN WIDTHS GOAL OR

05:08:56.651 --> 05:09:00.054
COPENHAGEN. TUCKED BETWEEN

05:09:00.121 --> 05:09:02.557
THEIR CHEEK AND THEY'RE LEFT.

05:09:02.624 --> 05:09:05.526
YOUNG KIDS BASEBALL PLAYERS

05:09:05.593 --> 05:09:08.329
HOOKED IN WHEN THEY WANTED TO

05:09:08.396 --> 05:09:12.433
QUIT THE COULD. I THINK OF THE

05:09:12.500 --> 05:09:13.468
TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD BASEBALL

05:09:13.534 --> 05:09:15.770
COACH IN CINEMA COUNTY. WHO

05:09:15.837 --> 05:09:18.106
DIED OF ORAL CANCER FROM THAT

05:09:18.172 --> 05:09:20.775
KIND OF PRODUCT. THE LEFT

05:09:20.842 --> 05:09:23.845
BEHIND A YOUNG CHILD. THAT'S

05:09:23.912 --> 05:09:24.746
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT

05:09:24.812 --> 05:09:27.148
HERE SO FOR ME THE CHOICE IS

05:09:27.215 --> 05:09:30.752
VERY CLEAR. IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT

05:09:30.818 --> 05:09:33.655
VAPING WHY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

05:09:33.721 --> 05:09:34.722
CAN DEBATE STATISTICS ALL DAY

05:09:34.789 --> 05:09:37.025
LONG AND YOU KNOW I THINK-

05:09:37.091 --> 05:09:38.826
MISTER FLORES SAID THAT HOOKAH

05:09:38.893 --> 05:09:40.194
IS LIKE THE NUMBER TO CONSUME

05:09:40.261 --> 05:09:42.931
PRODUCTS OUT THERE BUT YOU JUST

05:09:42.997 --> 05:09:44.999
WANT TO BAN VAPING. THAT'S A

05:09:45.066 --> 05:09:46.901
BIG WIN FOR TOBACCO COMPANIES.

05:09:46.968 --> 05:09:51.072
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT. OF THEM

05:09:51.139 --> 05:09:51.706
ARE BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS OFF

05:09:51.773 --> 05:09:52.340
ANYWAY. BECAUSE OF JULIAN SOME

05:09:52.407 --> 05:09:53.474
OF THE OTHER ISSUES OUT THERE

05:09:53.541 --> 05:09:55.143
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO

05:09:55.209 --> 05:09:57.645
PROTECT IS THIS. THEY WANT TO

05:09:57.712 --> 05:09:59.814
PROTECT PRODUCTS LIKE THIS. TWO

05:09:59.881 --> 05:10:02.951
PACK SWISHER SWEETS CHOCOLATE

05:10:03.017 --> 05:10:06.287

BOOZY WATERMELON BOOTIES HOUSE.

05:10:26.641 --> 05:10:27.508
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

05:10:27.575 --> 05:10:29.777
PREVENT HERE BECAUSE IF WE JUST

05:10:29.844 --> 05:10:31.980
BAN VAPING. THE KIDS ARE GOING

05:10:32.046 --> 05:10:34.182
TO CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT

05:10:34.248 --> 05:10:36.284
IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR THE TOBACCO

05:10:36.351 --> 05:10:39.887
INDUSTRY HUGE. SO I HATED

05:10:39.954 --> 05:10:41.055
HAVING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE

05:10:41.122 --> 05:10:43.157
AMENDMENT SENATOR. BUT YOU KNOW

05:10:43.224 --> 05:10:45.226
THE PROCESS AS WELL AS I DO THE

05:10:45.293 --> 05:10:49.297
GOAL IS TO MOVE SOMETHING GOOD.

05:10:49.364 --> 05:10:50.331
AND SOMETIMES THE PERFECT

05:10:50.398 --> 05:10:52.066
DOESN'T HAPPEN IT RARELY

05:10:52.133 --> 05:10:53.501
HAPPENS IN THIS HOUSE IF I HAD

05:10:53.568 --> 05:10:55.570
MY WAY WE'D BE ON SQUARE ONE

05:10:55.636 --> 05:10:57.805
WHERE YOUR BILL WAS STARTED.

05:10:57.872 --> 05:10:58.272
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY

05:10:58.339 --> 05:11:00.408
AMENDMENTS. WE'RE TRYING TO

05:11:00.475 --> 05:11:02.510
SAVE LIVES HERE FOLKS THAT'S

05:11:02.577 --> 05:11:04.879
THE BOTTOM LINE. AND THAT'S WHY

05:11:04.946 --> 05:11:06.981
I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS

05:11:07.048 --> 05:11:07.415
IT'S BEEN MY ENTIRE

05:11:07.482 --> 05:11:10.051
PROFESSIONAL LIFE. WHEN I WAS

05:11:10.118 --> 05:11:11.719

COMMENT ON A COUPLE OF THE

05:45:57.002 --> 05:45:59.138
ISSUES BECAUSE- I THINK I WAS

05:45:59.205 --> 05:46:02.007
ABLE TO HELP CLARIFY IN OUR

05:46:02.074 --> 05:46:03.742
CONVERSATIONS AND- THE BREADTH

05:46:03.809 --> 05:46:06.445
OF THE OPPOSITION I CERTAINLY.

05:46:06.512 --> 05:46:08.414
RESPECT TO THE SELF INTEREST OF

05:46:08.481 --> 05:46:10.950
THOSE BUSINESS ENTITIES

05:46:11.016 --> 05:46:12.718
ASSOCIATIONS ETCETERA. BUT

05:46:12.785 --> 05:46:14.987
AGAIN THE THRESHOLD LANDS OF

05:46:15.054 --> 05:46:16.388
THIS BILL IS PROTECTING

05:46:16.455 --> 05:46:19.191
PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS SO THE

05:46:19.258 --> 05:46:21.060
QUESTION IS COME UP ABOUT- I

05:46:21.127 --> 05:46:22.728
THINK THERE'S BEEN AN OVER

05:46:22.795 --> 05:46:23.362
BREATH AND SOME OF THE

05:46:23.429 --> 05:46:25.731
OPPOSITION ABOUT. THE ENTITIES

05:46:25.798 --> 05:46:27.633
THAT WOULD BE CAUGHT UP THAT IF

05:46:27.700 --> 05:46:29.735
A PHYSICIAN GROUPS SOUGHT TO

05:46:29.802 --> 05:46:33.172
NEGOTIATE A LEASE. WITH THE

05:46:33.239 --> 05:46:34.373
PROPERTY OWNER IN THEIR OUNTY

05:46:34.440 --> 05:46:35.207
THAT SOMEHOW THAT WOULD BE

05:46:35.274 --> 05:46:37.376
SUBJECT TO THE REVIEW OF THE

05:46:37.443 --> 05:46:39.378
TOURNEY GENERAL. NO IT WOULD

05:46:39.445 --> 05:46:41.113
NOT- WITH THE NARROWING

05:46:41.180 --> 05:46:43.983
AMENDMENTS WE FURTHER FOCUS ON

05:46:44.049 --> 05:46:46.018
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS YOU

05:46:46.085 --> 05:46:48.454
MENTIONED BEING THREE HOSPITALS

05:46:48.521 --> 05:46:49.288
ONE OF WHICH HAS TO HAVE A CUTE

05:46:49.355 --> 05:46:52.091
KERR. THE KAISER EXAMPLE- THEY

05:46:52.158 --> 05:46:54.193
ARE A BIG HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

05:46:54.260 --> 05:46:56.028
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING. WHEN

05:46:56.095 --> 05:46:59.632
KAISER SETS UP A NEW FACILITY

05:46:59.698 --> 05:47:01.500
ITSELF INITIATES THAT IT'S NOT

05:47:01.567 --> 05:47:03.135
THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND

05:47:03.202 --> 05:47:05.538
AFFILIATIONS IT'S THROUGH. THEY

05:47:05.604 --> 05:47:06.939
START FROM THE GROUND UP IF

05:47:07.006 --> 05:47:08.107
THEY'RE BUILDING A NEW HOSPITAL

05:47:08.174 --> 05:47:09.842
OR STARTING A NEW PRIMARY

05:47:09.909 --> 05:47:12.044
CLINIC. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

05:47:12.111 --> 05:47:15.014
OF THE KAISER MODEL- BUT WHEN

05:47:15.080 --> 05:47:17.983
WE LOOK AT A HOSPITAL THAT MAY

05:47:18.050 --> 05:47:21.921
BE IN DISTRESS. AND THERE'S A

05:47:21.987 --> 05:47:22.821
LARGER HELL CARE SO. THAT IS

05:47:22.888 --> 05:47:25.658
INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING THAT.

05:47:25.724 --> 05:47:27.593
THIS BILL DOES NOT BLOCK THAT

05:47:27.660 --> 05:47:29.695
IT DOES NOT PREVENT THAT IT

05:47:29.762 --> 05:47:31.864
DOES INSTITUTE A LEVEL OF

05:47:31.931 --> 05:47:33.999
REVIEW THAT IS CURRENTLY ONLY

05:47:34.066 --> 05:47:36.001
THERE IF AN ENTITY IS A

05:47:36.068 --> 05:47:38.170
NONPROFIT. A LOT OF THE

05:47:38.237 --> 05:47:40.439
COMMERCIAL MARKET IS FOR PROFIT

05:47:40.506 --> 05:47:42.441
TO FOR PROFIT AND THAT'S WHERE

05:47:42.508 --> 05:47:43.709
YOU GET EQUITY FUNDS AND HEDGE

05:47:43.776 --> 05:47:45.578

05:47:45.644 --> 05:47:47.379
ALLEGIANCE. IS TO THE

SHAREHOLDERS. THE SHAREHOLDER

05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:52.851
SERVED BY GENERATING PROFIT.

05:47:52.918 --> 05:47:54.753
THIS BILL SIXTY EQUALIZE THAT

05:47:54.820 --> 05:47:56.855
LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN A FOR

05:47:56.922 --> 05:47:58.924

NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE TOUGH- IT'S

05:54:29.881 --> 05:54:31.717
ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT

MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING

05:54:33.051 --> 05:54:34.953
LEGISLATION THIS WORKABLE IN A

05:54:35.020 --> 05:54:35.721
LARGE ESTATE AS LARGE AND

DIVERSE CALIFORNIA. IS A HUGE

05:54:37.789 --> 05:54:40.792
CHALLENGE. THE MAINTAINING

05:54:40.859 --> 05:54:43.261
ACCESS LANGUAGE ACCESS TO CARE

05:54:43.328 --> 05:54:43.862
LANGUAGE WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO

05:54:43.929 --> 05:54:45.998
ME. THERE WERE MANY EMPTY

05:54:46.064 --> 05:54:47.332
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE VERY

05:54:47.399 --> 05:54:49.701
IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I

APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH ME

05:54:51.503 --> 05:54:52.537
AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE

05:54:52.604 --> 05:54:54.239
EFFECTIVE COVERT NINETEEN HAS

05:54:54.306 --> 05:54:55.841
HAD ON OUR POPULATION ECONOMY

05:54:55.907 --> 05:54:57.376
MAKING SURE COMMUNITIES DON'T

05:54:57.442 --> 05:54:59.244
LOSE ACCESS TO CARE ESPECIALLY

05:54:59.311 --> 05:55:01.213
THROUGH A HOSPITAL CLOSURE. IS

05:55:01.279 --> 05:55:03.382
IMPERATIVE AND THAT MEANT THAT

05:55:03.448 --> 05:55:04.950
AMEND WILL ENSURE THE AG ALSO

05:55:05.017 --> 05:55:06.918
HAS THE ABILITY TO HIM APPROVED

05:55:06.985 --> 05:55:10.922
CHANGE THE SECOND OF CONTROL

05:55:10.989 --> 05:55:11.690
THAT MAINTAINS RATHER AND

05:55:11.757 --> 05:55:14.326
ACCESS OF CARE. YOU KNOW I HAVE

05:55:14.393 --> 05:55:17.295
A HOSPITAL IN MY DISTRICT THAT-

05:55:17.362 --> 05:55:18.930
WAS ON THE REALLY ON THE ON THE

05:55:18.997 --> 05:55:22.467
ROPES. AND WAS WAS LOOKING AT

05:55:22.534 --> 05:55:25.137
CLOSURE- FORTUNATELY ANOTHER

05:55:25.203 --> 05:55:27.606
HOSPITAL SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO

05:55:27.673 --> 05:55:28.840
COME IN AND THROUGH AN

05:55:28.907 --> 05:55:30.742
OPERATING AGREEMENT THAT THAT

05:55:30.809 --> 05:55:31.977
AWESOME THAT HOSPITAL IS

05:55:32.044 --> 05:55:34.780
REMAINING OPEN THEY WILL

05:55:34.846 --> 05:55:38.050
ACTUALLY- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

05:55:38.116 --> 05:55:39.251
OF THE SYSTEM THEY WILL

05:55:39.317 --> 05:55:41.319
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE WHAT. YOU'RE

05:55:41.386 --> 05:55:42.721
WITH THE INTENT WAS ORIGINALLY

05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:45.057
WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE CARE I DO

05:55:45.123 --> 05:55:47.059
BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

05:55:47.125 --> 05:55:49.061
SIZE OF THEIR SYSTEM. BUT THERE

05:55:49.127 --> 05:55:51.730
ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES OUT THERE

05:55:51.797 --> 05:55:52.864
WHERE AN ACQUISITION OR OR

05:55:52.931 --> 05:55:55.467
CHAIN OF CONTROL. MIGHT JUST

05:55:55.534 --> 05:55:57.869
MAINTAIN IT N. AND THAT AND

05:55:57.936 --> 05:55:59.738
THAT MAY BE ENOUGH. FOR THAT

05:55:59.805 --> 05:56:02.407
COMMUNITY. I THINK THE HARD

05:56:02.474 --> 05:56:06.478
THING FOR ME- IS THAT. WE ARE

05:56:06.545 --> 05:56:10.215
WORKING TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO

05:56:10.282 --> 05:56:12.150
MAIN YOU KNOW. MAINTAIN THE

05:56:12.217 --> 05:56:14.119
COST OF CARE SO THAT IS

05:56:14.186 --> 05:56:16.488
REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE THIS IS A

05:56:16.555 --> 05:56:19.324
BILL ABOUT CONSUMERS. WHAT

05:56:19.391 --> 05:56:21.626
HAPPENED WITH THE SYSTEM. THAT

05:56:21.693 --> 05:56:25.597
IS CLOSE TO US ALLOWED FOR THE

05:56:25.664 --> 05:56:28.166
INCREASE IN COST. FOR NORTHERN

05:56:28.233 --> 05:56:32.003
CALIFORNIA TO BE 2230% HIGHER

05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.904
THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

05:56:32.971 --> 05:56:34.506
BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF

05:56:34.573 --> 05:56:37.943
THE SYSTEM. THAT TO ME IS

05:56:38.009 --> 05:56:41.847
UNFAIR. AND THAT IS THE MEAT OF

05:56:41.913 --> 05:56:43.749
THE ISSUE THAT IS WHY THE BILL

05:56:43.815 --> 05:56:47.018
IS HERE. YOU KNOW YOU MAY ARGUE

05:56:47.085 --> 05:56:48.920
THAT THE BREADTH OF THE BILL

05:56:48.987 --> 05:56:51.757
AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE

05:56:51.823 --> 05:56:54.192
ALWAYS TROUBLES ME IN THESE IS

05:56:54.259 --> 05:56:55.961
THAT YOU KNOW THAT I FEEL LIKE.

05:56:56.027 --> 05:56:58.163
THE EMPHASIS HAS HAS BEEN ON

05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:59.698
THE OPPOSITION TO MORE TO KILL

05:56:59.765 --> 05:57:03.435
THE BILL. THEN TO RECOGNIZE AND

05:57:03.502 --> 05:57:06.037
WORK WITH US IN A MINUTE. THE

05:57:06.104 --> 05:57:09.074
COSTS ARE TOO HIGH. THE COST

05:57:09.141 --> 05:57:09.608
THAT IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE

05:57:09.674 --> 05:57:12.444
ANYMORE. WHEN THE COST OF

05:57:12.511 --> 05:57:15.046
HEALTH CARE DOUBLE IS RISES AT

05:57:15.113 --> 05:57:17.282
TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION YOU

05:57:17.349 --> 05:57:19.918
HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND

05:57:19.985 --> 05:57:21.586
RECOGNIZED THERE IS A PROBLEM.

05:57:21.653 --> 05:57:23.188
BUT AT TIMES THE INTERESTS ARE

05:57:23.255 --> 05:57:26.658
SO LARGE. THE INTERESTS ARE SO

05:57:26.725 --> 05:57:29.394
GREAT. THAT WE OFTEN IGNORE

05:57:29.461 --> 05:57:31.563
THAT NOW THERE IS NO QUESTION

05:57:31.630 --> 05:57:32.831
THAT OUR HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN

05:57:32.898 --> 05:57:35.300
INCREDIBLE LIFELINE TO US.

05:57:35.367 --> 05:57:37.002
RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY WHERE WE'D

05:57:37.068 --> 05:57:39.971
BE WITHOUT THEM. BUT THERE ARE

05:57:40.038 --> 05:57:42.541
BAD ACTORS. THERE ARE BAD

05:57:42.607 --> 05:57:45.610
ACTORS AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE

05:57:45.677 --> 05:57:48.580
TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO I'M

05:57:48.647 --> 05:57:49.981
I'M GOING TO PRIVACY SUPPORTING

05:57:50.048 --> 05:57:51.383

THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE GIVEN OF

05:59:04.990 --> 05:59:07.425
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NETWORK-

05:59:07.492 --> 05:59:09.394

BRINGING THIS BILL FOR TO HELP

06:48:56.144 --> 06:48:57.412
OUR HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING

06:48:57.479 --> 06:48:58.513
FINANCIALLY THROUGH THIS

06:48:58.580 --> 06:49:00.949
PANDEMIC I DO HAVE SOME

06:49:01.016 --> 06:49:04.052
CONCERNS AND HOW THE BILL IS

06:49:04.119 --> 06:49:05.587
DRAFTED TODAY. IT IS MY

06:49:05.654 --> 06:49:07.556
UNDERSTANDING THE PRIOR SEISMIC

06:49:07.623 --> 06:49:09.558
SAFETY EXTENSIONS HAVE ALWAYS

06:49:09.625 --> 06:49:11.026
INCLUDED TRANSPARENCY

06:49:11.093 --> 06:49:13.061
REQUIREMENTS AND BENCHMARKS

06:49:13.128 --> 06:49:14.997
LIKE CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES.

06:49:15.063 --> 06:49:16.465
WHY IS THIS LEGISLATION GIVING

06:49:16.531 --> 06:49:18.667
AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN YEARS MORE

06:49:18.734 --> 06:49:20.168
TIME WITHOUT AY ASSURANCES

06:49:20.235 --> 06:49:22.504
THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN ALL

06:49:22.571 --> 06:49:23.972
HOSPITALS WILL ACTUALLY BE IN

06:49:24.039 --> 06:49:26.275
COMPLIANCE. I'M ALSO CONCERNED

06:49:26.341 --> 06:49:27.743
ABOUT THE BROAD APPLICATION OF

06:49:27.809 --> 06:49:28.877
THE BILL I KNOW THERE ARE

06:49:28.944 --> 06:49:30.779
HOSPITALS ON TRACK TO MAKE THE

06:49:30.846 --> 06:49:32.681
TWENTY THIRTY SCHEDULE DEADLINE

06:49:32.748 --> 06:49:34.149
AND I BELIEVE THAT THOSE CAN'T

06:49:34.216 --> 06:49:36.418
ACCOMPLISH THAT THOSE THAT CAN

06:49:36.485 --> 06:49:38.720
ACCOMPLISH IT. SHOULD I LOOK

06:49:38.787 --> 06:49:40.188
FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

06:49:40.255 --> 06:49:42.291
AND BILLS. I FEAR THAT FEAR

06:49:42.357 --> 06:49:43.292
THAT THIS PROPOSAL COULD

06:49:43.358 --> 06:49:44.760
ENCOURAGE HOSPITALS TO HAVE THE

06:49:44.826 --> 06:49:46.528
MONEY AND THE PLANS TO DELAY

06:49:46.595 --> 06:49:48.330
THEIR WORK. CAN THIS

06:49:48.397 --> 06:49:49.831
LEGISLATION BE LIMITED TO

06:49:49.898 --> 06:49:52.067
HOSPITALS THE SHOW TRUE

06:49:52.134 --> 06:49:52.567
FINANCIAL NEED FOR THIS

06:49:52.634 --> 06:49:55.304
EXTENSION. SINCE THESE BILLS

06:49:55.370 --> 06:49:56.705
ARE ONLY GOING THROUGH ONE

06:49:56.772 --> 06:49:59.174
POLICY COMMITTEE IT IS

06:49:59.241 --> 06:49:59.741
IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT WE GET

06:49:59.808 --> 06:50:01.543
THIS RIGHT. I BELIEVE WHAT THE

06:50:01.610 --> 06:50:03.111
OPPOSITION PROPOSED IS VERY

06:50:03.178 --> 06:50:05.747
REASONABLE. SINCE THIS BILL

06:50:05.814 --> 06:50:07.082
LANGUAGE WAS ONLY AMENDED IN

06:50:07.149 --> 06:50:09.151

THE THINGS THAT IS. LACKING IN

07:18:03.690 --> 07:18:05.492

THOSE WHO ARE RETURNED BACK TO

07:18:08.996 --> 07:18:11.131
THE COMMUNITY. SO IF I COUNTY

07:18:11.198 --> 07:18:12.299
DECIDES THAT THAT'S AN

07:18:12.366 --> 07:18:13.700
INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT THEY

07:18:13.767 --> 07:18:15.168
WISH TO PURSUE. AND THEY GET

07:18:15.235 --> 07:18:18.572

DO SO BUT FORCED TO AND INDEED

07:18:29.916 --> 07:18:31.485
AS I SAID EARLIER IT DOES NOT

07:18:31.551 --> 07:18:33.520
TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM ANY OTHER

07:18:33.587 --> 07:18:37.090
COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. THERE IS

07:18:37.157 --> 07:18:38.058
THOSE THAT ARE CONCERNED AT

07:18:38.125 --> 07:18:39.493
THIS MONEY MIGHT BE DIVERTED

07:18:39.559 --> 07:18:41.628
FROM ONE PROGRAM INTO A NOTHER

07:18:41.695 --> 07:18:43.497
PROGRAM. THE LOCALS ARE GOING

07:18:43.563 --> 07:18:44.464
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT

07:18:44.531 --> 07:18:47.534
DECISION EVEN THOUGH- THERE'S-

07:18:47.601 --> 07:18:48.435
EIGHT EIGHT OF THESE COUNTIES

07:18:48.502 --> 07:18:51.171

IF THEY'RE NOT FORCED TO BE

07:18:54.141 --> 07:18:56.576
THEY STILL RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL

07:18:56.643 --> 07:18:59.379
TO DO SO ABSOLUTELY CAPSULE. AT

07:18:59.446 --> 07:19:00.647
THE END THERE'S A PROVISION THE

07:19:00.714 --> 07:19:03.316
BILL THAT DOES NOT THAT FORBIDS

07:19:03.383 --> 07:19:04.651
THE SUPPLICATION OF FUNDS

07:19:04.718 --> 07:19:06.053

07:19:06.119 --> 07:19:09.623

07:19:13.427 --> 07:19:18.398
CHAIR- SB SIX SIX FIVE SIX TO

07:19:18.465 --> 07:19:20.067
ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST

07:19:20.133 --> 07:19:22.202
PRESSING ISSUES IN OUR STATE-

07:19:22.269 --> 07:19:24.137
IN FACT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

07:19:24.204 --> 07:19:26.606
SERVICES IN COUNTY JAIL AND

07:19:26.673 --> 07:19:27.774
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I CARE

07:19:27.841 --> 07:19:30.210
DEEPLY ABOUT GETTING TREATMENT

07:19:30.277 --> 07:19:33.513
TO JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS

07:19:33.580 --> 07:19:36.750
WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND HELP

07:19:36.817 --> 07:19:38.719
PEOPLE HEAL AND HAVE SUCCESSFUL

07:19:38.785 --> 07:19:41.088
REENTRY. I'VE STUDY THE ISSUES

07:19:41.154 --> 07:19:42.289
RAISED ON BOTH SIDES AND

07:19:42.355 --> 07:19:43.724
UNDERSTAND THE STILL

07:19:43.790 --> 07:19:45.525
SIGNIFICANT DEBATE ABOUT. THE

07:19:45.592 --> 07:19:48.061
USE OF M. H. ESSAY FUNDS FOR

07:19:48.128 --> 07:19:49.463
THIS PURPOSE BUT I'M SWAYED

07:19:49.529 --> 07:19:52.532
THAT THIS IS INDEED APPROPRIATE

07:19:52.599 --> 07:19:53.433
BECAUSE IT FURTHERS THE INTENT

07:19:53.500 --> 07:19:55.302
OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

07:19:55.368 --> 07:19:58.271
THAT. THE PILOT ROOM IS LIMITED

07:19:58.338 --> 07:19:59.740
TIME IN SCOPE AND THERE ARE

07:19:59.806 --> 07:20:02.342
SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS. BECAUSE

07:20:02.409 --> 07:20:03.310
OF THE DIRE NEED FOR THESE

07:20:03.376 --> 07:20:04.945
RESOURCES. TO PREVENT

07:20:05.011 --> 07:20:07.948
RECIDIVISM AND TREAT- URGENT

07:20:08.014 --> 07:20:09.149
BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES I

07:20:09.216 --> 07:20:10.851
SUPPORT THE BILL AND THEN KURT

07:20:10.917 --> 07:20:14.654
AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU

07:20:14.721 --> 07:20:17.090
VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. MISTER

07:20:17.157 --> 07:20:19.159
ROBERTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU

07:20:19.226 --> 07:20:21.194
MISTER CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU OF

07:20:21.261 --> 07:20:22.763
CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE

07:20:22.829 --> 07:20:24.431
FORWARD I JUST WANT TO I KNOW

07:20:24.498 --> 07:20:26.500
WE TALKED- AND TRY TO WORK

07:20:26.566 --> 07:20:28.268
THROUGH SOME OF THE ITEMS IN

07:20:28.335 --> 07:20:29.936
THE BILL AND I MENTIONED WHILE

07:20:30.003 --> 07:20:30.537
WE'RE ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF

07:20:30.604 --> 07:20:32.072
SUPERVISORS WE WORKED- WITH

07:20:32.139 --> 07:20:35.008
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO USE SOME

07:20:35.075 --> 07:20:36.042
OF THIS THESE DOLLARS TO ENSURE

07:20:36.109 --> 07:20:39.112
THAT THERE WAS- SOMEONE GOING

07:20:39.179 --> 07:20:41.248
OUT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

07:20:41.314 --> 07:20:43.583
FIREFIGHTERS ON THAT WAS ONE

07:20:43.650 --> 07:20:48.355
THAT MADE THAT MESSAGE WHAT THE-

07:20:48.421 --> 07:20:53.393
OUR- THE OFTEN STILL WOULD BE

07:20:53.460 --> 07:20:55.061
MADE AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION

07:20:55.128 --> 07:20:58.465
I. THERE THE FUNDING MECHANISM

07:20:58.532 --> 07:21:00.100
OF IT ALSO WOULD THAT BE AT THE

07:21:00.167 --> 07:21:02.402
LOCAL BOARDS DISCRETION OR

07:21:02.469 --> 07:21:04.337
WOULD THAT BE AT THE STATE-

07:21:04.404 --> 07:21:07.073
WITH THE DOLLARS COMING IN. SO

07:21:07.140 --> 07:21:09.943
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. THE FUNDS

07:21:10.010 --> 07:21:12.879
ARE DIVIDED AMONG THE COUNTIES

07:21:12.946 --> 07:21:14.681
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS

07:21:14.748 --> 07:21:16.016
IT IS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE

07:21:16.082 --> 07:21:18.051
ACTUALLY ANY ADDITIONAL MONIES

07:21:18.118 --> 07:21:19.853
OF THE INNOVATIVE FUN AND

07:21:19.920 --> 07:21:21.955
ALLOWS THE COUNTY TO USE THOSE

07:21:22.022 --> 07:21:24.324
INNOVATIVE PROBLEMS SHOULD THEY

07:21:24.391 --> 07:21:27.027
APPLY. TO BE USED IN THE JAIL

07:21:27.093 --> 07:21:28.228
FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SO

07:21:28.295 --> 07:21:29.830
THE LOCAL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

07:21:29.896 --> 07:21:32.699
HAS CONTROL OVER HOW MUCH MONEY

07:21:32.766 --> 07:21:35.135
IS SPENT OF THAT POT AND WHERE

07:21:35.202 --> 07:21:36.837
THAT MONEY IS SPENT OF THAT.

07:21:36.903 --> 07:21:39.005
NOW THEY DON'T HAVE EXCLUSIVE

07:21:39.072 --> 07:21:41.808
CONTROL BECAUSE THE BOARD THAT

07:21:41.875 --> 07:21:42.909
OVERSEES THE ALLOCATION THE

07:21:42.976 --> 07:21:45.078
USES PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY.

07:21:45.145 --> 07:21:47.981
ALSO HAS TO AGREE. NOW WE ALSO-

07:21:48.048 --> 07:21:50.016
TOUCHED ON- ONE OF THE OTHER

07:21:50.083 --> 07:21:53.019
TOPICS AS FAR AS- COUNTY JAILS

07:21:53.086 --> 07:21:54.120
AND SOME OF THESE FUNDING

07:21:54.187 --> 07:21:55.422
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE BE USED

07:21:55.488 --> 07:21:57.490
IN THE IN THE STATE. PRISON

07:21:57.557 --> 07:21:59.993
SYSTEM RIGHT THERE IS- FELONIES

07:22:00.060 --> 07:22:00.927
AND THESE ARE THE THINGS WE

07:22:00.994 --> 07:22:03.029
TALKED ABOUT. BUT WE ALSO

07:22:03.096 --> 07:22:05.265
TALKED ABOUT NOW IN THE COUNTY

07:22:05.332 --> 07:22:07.067
JAIL WE HAVE A MORE OF A I

07:22:07.133 --> 07:22:09.769
THINK THE THREE TIER. SENTENCES

07:22:09.836 --> 07:22:12.172
THAT ARE BEING- FOR PLAYED OUT

07:22:12.239 --> 07:22:14.941
IN THE COUNTY AREA SO HOW DOES

07:22:15.008 --> 07:22:17.644
THAT PLAY WITHIN THE DOLLARS.

07:22:17.711 --> 07:22:20.313
THE I THINK COME UP DOLLARS I'M

07:22:20.380 --> 07:22:23.116
GOING TOWARDS- THOSE TYPES OF-

07:22:23.183 --> 07:22:25.552
FELONIES IN THOSE TYPES OF

07:22:25.619 --> 07:22:26.119
PRISONERS THAT ARE FROM THE

07:22:26.186 --> 07:22:29.155
STATE. SO IT IS TRUE THAT SIXTY

07:22:29.222 --> 07:22:30.523
THREE MONIES CANNOT BE USED IN

07:22:30.590 --> 07:22:32.459
PRISONS AND THIS DOESN'T APPLY

07:22:32.525 --> 07:22:33.860
TO PRESENT THIS APPLIES ONLY

07:22:33.927 --> 07:22:35.428
TO. COUNTY FACILITIES OF

07:22:35.495 --> 07:22:38.031
INCARCERATION IT'S ALSO TRUE AS

YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT PEOPLE

07:22:38.765 --> 07:22:40.267
ARE SPENDING LONGER PERIODS OF

07:22:40.333 --> 07:22:42.469
TIME BUT- IF YOU'RE IN A COUNTY

07:22:42.535 --> 07:22:46.306

COMMUNITY. SO FOR US IN A

07:22:58.451 --> 07:23:00.153
PROBABLY ALL AGREE MIGHT

07:23:00.220 --> 07:23:03.490
PROVIDE A WHOLE. SOME TO

07:23:03.556 --> 07:23:04.024
PREVENT THEM FROM GOING A

07:23:04.090 --> 07:23:05.158

THIS CASE IS NOT ONLY BAD

07:46:59.624 --> 07:47:00.859

07:47:21.213 --> 07:47:22.347
WOULD WOULD CREATE CONFUSION

07:47:22.414 --> 07:47:24.716
