AS CALIFORNIA EMERGENCE EMERGES FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER THAT IS THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT IS BECOMING CLEAR. THE MEDICAID MANY CALIFORNIANS WILL REQUIRE STATE ASSISTANCE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THIS PANDEMICS ARE STATE OF AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF OVER SIXTEEN PERCENT. BUSINESSES STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS WERE SHUTTERED. HOUSING WAS PUT IN JEOPARDY FOR A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE STRONG CALIFORNIA COME BACK ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PROVIDED RESOURCES. FOR US TO HELP CALIFORNIANS REBOUND AND BILL BACK EVEN STRONGER THAN BEFORE. WE CAN AFTER ALL BUILD BACK BETTER. THESE FUNDS ALLOW US TO FINALLY BE PROACTIVE AND PLOT A COURSE THAT NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE IMMEDIATE NEED. PREPARES US FOR A BETTER FUTURE WE CAN INVEST IN HOUSING BY SUPPORTING SHOVEL READY PROJECTS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE COORDINATED AND PROVIDING. INDIVIDUALS ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED.

THAT PREPARE CALIFORNIANS FOR HIGH PAYING TO STAND WILL JOBS AND- WE CAN ALSO SUPPORT OUR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO ART MUSIC CULTURE AND SAFE GATHERING SPACES FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS. BUT WE ONLY HAVE A TWENTY MORE DAYS UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET DEADLINE. DOES NOT GIVE US ENOUGH TIME TO THOUGHTFULLY ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES. THE AGENDA TODAY THE CONTAINS NINETY NINE. ACTION ITEMS WHICH ARE. INTENDEDTO ALLOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO CLOSE DOWN FOR THIS BUDGET PROCESS AND MOVE THE BUDGET DISCUSSION FORWARD. YOU WILL NOTICE. THAT FOR MANY OF THE LARGER ITEMS AND PACKAGES. THE.

AND THE OUT YEARS TO ALLOW OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND INVESTMENT IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNITS BUT ALSO FLEXIBLE FUNDING THAT ALLOWS OUR LOCALS TO RESPOND TO THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY THE PLAN ALSO DOES NOT FORGET ARE HOMELESS YOUTH FINALLY WE ARE NOT WRITING A BLANK CHECK ON HOMELESSNESS OUR PLAN INCLUDES A STRONGER ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT. PRODUCE RESULTS. WE ALL HAVE THE GOAL OF HOUSING EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AFTER ALL I THINK MANY OF US BELIEVE. THAT HOUSING IS IN FACT A HUMAN RIGHT. ON WORKFORCE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED MORE THAN ONE BILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE SUB COMMITTEE. IF WE ADD THE PROPOSAL'S FUNDS DIRECTED TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. THE MAY REVISION INVEST MORE THAN FIVE BILLION IN OUR WORKERS AND LOCAL ECONOMIES AS PUBLIC SERVANTS WE MUST DO WE MUST BE GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THE ASSEMBLY WORKFORCE PLAN WILL DIRECT FUNDS TO WORKERS WHO NEED THEM MOST AND PROVIDE AN EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY. GOOD PAYING SUSTAINABLE JOBS. THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS SUPPLEMENT EXISTING EFFORTS AND INVESTMENTS. IN PLACES WHERE EXISTING FUNDS ARE NOT WORKING WE WILL ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES AND OFFER SUPPORT. FINALLY WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR K. TWO K. THROUGH TWELVE HIGHER EDUCATION INDUSTRY LABOR AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ARE ALL CONNECTED IN DECIDING THE FUTURE OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES. ADDITIONALLY WE WILL NOT BE DEFERRING ACTION ON THE MAY REVISE ON THE ARTS INVESTMENT TODAY. THE MAY REVISE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS IN THE ARTS AND TOURISM THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET.

AN ASSEMBLY INVESTMENT IN THE ARTS A SUPPORT ARTIST. AND VENUES ON WHICH THEY RELY ON. ALL IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY. THAT WAS LOST FOR MANY DURING THE PANDEMIC.

WE ALL AGREE I BELIEVE THAT A SAFETY NET THAT SHOULD WORK- A CLEARLY THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED A CIRCUMSTANCE IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH THAT HAS REALLY TESTED THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR OFFICES IN TERMS OF ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE AND AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL WHEN HELPING TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS- IS THERE ANY COMMENT FROM- THE DIRECTOR OR ANYONE- IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS ALREADY HEARD.

AND THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER LUCKY I REALIZED THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ELLUL. I'M SORRY THE HEAD OF IT AND- NO NO YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT. I NEEDED TO CALL ON THEM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT WAS WORTH IT. LET'S NOT TAKE A MOMENT TO VERIFY THAT THEY ARE ON. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE NAIL BRANDON IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT HE JANET THE CARD AGAINST. I GET IT RIGHT BACK I'M SORRY WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME CAN YOU BRING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. START OVER PLEASE. I AM ON THE LINE THANK. LET'S GO WITH- MISTER CHAZ ALAMOS AND WE SEE HIM ON AS WELL AND MISBRANDED OR HAVING SOME COMPLICATIONS WITH YOUR TECHNOLOGY. SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MARGARET ALAMO WITH ELIA OFFICE TO BEGIN WITH. CHAD HELLO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CHANGED HERE- TEARS VISITORS QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY. THE STATE HAS CURRENT BORROWED LAST. I WOULD SAY BALANCE OF ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS- THE ADMINISTRATION'S MOST RECENT FORECAST FROM LAST FALL. TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE WILL REACH TWENTY FOUR BILLION BY NEXT YEAR BOB WITH UPDATED FORECASTING- AND SOMEWHAT BETTER ECONOMIC INFORMATION SINCE THE FALL WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL BE A SMALLER AMOUNT ONCE THE INVESTIGATION PUTS FORTH ITS NEW POPCORN FORECAST WHICH IS DUE OUT JUST. THIS WEEK- YESTERDAY OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED A REPORT CALLED- REPAYING THE STATE'S FEDERAL YOU ARE LOANS IN WHICH WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF. THE STATE REPAYMENT SO TO SPEAK UNDER FEDERAL LAW I'M IN THAT REPORT WE- PLAY OUT TO OF SCENARIOS AND WE CALLED THE LOW COST SCENARIO AND THE HIGH COST SCENARIO FOR THE STATE AND EMPLOYERS IN REPAYING THESE LOANS UNDER BOTH SCENARIOS. BOB ALONE WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO BE REPAID- WE ANTICIPATE ABOUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW WONDERFUL SCENARIOS FOR THOSE LOANS TO BE REPAID AND AGAIN JUST FOR CONTEXT IN PLAYERS. WILL REPAY THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LOAN THROUGH AUTOMATIC FEDERAL PAYROLL TAX INCREASES THAT ARE SET OUT IN FEDERAL LAW AND THE STATE OPERATES PARK WILL PAY ANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THOSE AMOUNTS- ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MIGHT. HAVE ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THANK YOU. OKAY DO JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT BILL OF IN. WHEN EMPLOYERS BE SAY AND AGREE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX IT. MEETING THEIR OBLIGATION TO YOU JUST INDICATED THEY'LL BE PAYING. OF COURSE SIR- THE FEDERAL INCREASE TO YOU WHY PAYROLL TAXES WILL GO BACK FOR TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO NEXT YEAR- HOWEVER UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE IRS BOB RECOUP THOSE PAYROLL TAXES BUT WILL BEGIN TO DO SO UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THAT THE FIRST. WHEN THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD INCREASE PAYROLL TAXES LIMITED BY BUSINESSES WILL BEGIN BACK IN THE- EARLY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OKAY MY FINAL QUESTION IS IT LIKELY THAT THOSE PAYMENTS WILL PROBABLY GO. TO THE PROJECTED DATE OF TWENTY FORTY ONE THAT'S WHAT I'VE READ IS THAT UNLIKELY SCENARIO. A. B. TO PROJECTIONS THAT OUR OFFICE- PRODUCED AND PUBLISHED YESTERDAY WE ESTIMATE THAT IF EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE PAYING INCREASED FEDERAL FEDERAL TAXES THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY OR TWENTY THIRTY ONE I HAVE TO PENDING ON WHETHER SOME OF THE LOW COST OR HIGH COST SCENARIO. SO UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS IT WOULD BE A MUCH SHORTER REPAYMENT PERIODS OF TWENTY FORTY ONE- OF COURSE I SHOULD CALL THE OFFICE WITH. THE LONG RANGE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY BUT THOSE TWENTY THIRTY OR TWENTY THIRTY ONE REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME. OF WHEN THE LOAN TO BE REPAID. THANK YOU.
