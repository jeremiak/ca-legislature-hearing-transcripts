TODAY SB THIRTY SEVEN IS A

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.481
MECHANISM TO INCENTIVIZE

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:11.549
CORPORATIONS THAT DO BIG IN

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:13.985
CALIFORNIA AND NOTE THAT IT'S

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:16.921

EMPLOYEES THE GOAL OF SB THIRTY

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:25.130

DISCUSSED ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.038

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.541
STARK REALITY. OUR ECONOMY IS

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.343
BOOMING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:40.778
ACROSS THE US. CORPORATE

PROFITS ARE AT RECORD HIGHS

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:45.850
UNEMPLOYMENT IS RECORD LOW YET

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:49.187
THE GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:51.789
BETWEEN WEALTHY CEOS AND THE

00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:54.058
AVERAGE WORKER THE AVERAGE

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.528
EMPLOYEE KEEPS WIDENING. THE

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:59.297
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS THAT MOST OF

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.799
OUR PARENTS AND SOME OF US.

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:04.302
WORKED A FEW DECADES AGO NO

ECONOMIC SECURITY. AND THE MORE

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:10.708
HOURS YOU WORK FOR THE HARDER

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:13.511
YOU WORK RARELY TRANSLATES NOW

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:14.879
TO A GREATER REWARD OR

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.681
SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:17.782
IMPROVEMENT TO YOU AND YOUR

S. IS NOW THE MOST EXTREME THAT

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.389
IT'S BEEN IN A CENTURY SINCE

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:28.893
THE GILDED AGE AND OUR TOP 1%

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.061
TWELFTH THE INDIVIDUALS IN

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:33.064
AMERICA HOLDS ABOUT 40% OF THE

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.967
ENTIRE NATION'S WEALTH. AND IN

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:38.436
OUR OWN CITIES UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:41.206
SEE IT WHEN CONSTITUENTS THE

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:43.708
BARS WORK FULL TIME JOBS BUT

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:47.312
CAN NOT AFFORD AN ADDRESS WHERE

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.781
THEIR W. TWO CAN BE MAILED TO.

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:51.482
MANY OF THEM THESE FIRST WITH

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:53.218
FULL TIME JOBS ARE LIVING IN

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:55.820
THEIR CARS OR COUCH SURFING AND

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.789
SOME UNFORTUNATELY EVEN ON THE

00:30:57.855 --> 00:31:00.491
STREETS. WE NOW CALIFORNIA HAS

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:03.194
THE FOURTH BIGGEST GAP BETWEEN

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:05.363
RICH AND POOR IN THE NATION.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.765
NOW OUR BIG CORPORATIONS ARE

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.267
ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF THIS

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:13.137
PROBLEM NOT ONLY BUT ONE. C. E.

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:16.874
O. PAY OF CORPORATIONS HAS SKY

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:20.645
ROCKETED NEARLY 1000% IN THE

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:23.581
PAST FOUR DECADES YET THE PAY

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.316
OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:27.418
EMPLOYEE HAS REMAINED MOSTLY

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:29.787
STAGNANT SINCE THE SEVENTIES OF

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:32.156
COURSE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.191
SO IN THE SEVENTIES YOUR

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:35.860
COMPANY BOSS TOOK HOME ROUGHLY

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.562
THIRTY TIMES MORE THAN THE

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.897
RIVER EMPLOYEE BUT TO DATE THE

00:31:39.964 --> 00:31:42.967
LONG RANGE OF CEO PAY TO

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:50.074
EMPLOYEE PAY IS ONE HALF TIMES

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.876
THE AVERAGE. IS THREE HUNDRED

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.712
TIMES WITH. MANY COMPANY COCA

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.915
COLA MANY OTHERS AREUPWARDS TO

00:31:57.982 --> 00:32:01.419
A THOUSAND TIMES AND HIGHER. SO

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.988
SB THIRTY SEVEN IS DESIGNED TO

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:06.424
ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY WE'VE

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:08.293
DONE WELL IN CALIFORNIA BY

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:11.262
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT WE

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.698
NOW THERE'S CONFRONTING THE

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.667
FACT THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:17.135
NOT ADEQUATE YES OF HIGH PRICE

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:21.139
OF LIVING. BUT HE- OUR FOUR

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.908
YEARS HELP SHARE THIS BURDEN NO

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.243
I DON'T WANT TO CALL IT A

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.678
BURDEN IT'S NOT A BURDEN

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:30.248
BECAUSE INVESTING IN EMPLOYEES

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:31.449
HELPS THE ECONOMY OVERALL IF

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.950
THE EMPLOYEES ARE SPENDING

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:34.452
THEIR MONEY AND CARING LESS

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:36.087
DEBT THAN THEIR BUYING THE

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:37.689
GOODS AND SERVICES THAT THE

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.857
COMPANIES THEMSELVES ARE MAKING

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:44.062
IN PRODUCING SO SB THREE SEVEN

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.130
IS DOES NOT BIND TO PRECISE

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:51.803
SAID DRESSED JUST. QUICKLY SAY

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.738
WHAT NOW WE GET BY WITH THIS.

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.273
COULD HAVE DESIGNED IT SB

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:55.907
THIRTY SEVEN TO BE RICH REVENUE

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:56.774
NEUTRAL AND THE- LAST HAVE A

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.509
PROGRESSIVE CHANGE TO THE TAX

00:32:58.576 --> 00:33:00.244
RATE. SO THAT WE PERHAPS

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.013
LOWERED THE CORPORATE INCOME

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.919
TAX RATE. IN THAT RANGE OF

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.220
THIRTY THIRTY TIMES CO PAYDIRT

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:12.023
WORKER PAY- AND THEN

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.791
PROGRESSIVELY RAISED IT BASED

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:16.627
ON THAT AMOUNT SO THAT THE

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.196
HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:19.797
WOULD BE IN FOR THOSE PEOPLE

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.732
WHO ARE THOSE CORPORATIONS-

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:22.500
THOUSAND TIMES AND HIGHER. NOW

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:24.736
THE REASON THE BILL BEFORE YOU

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:28.573
IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE REVENUE

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:31.309
AND HAS A BASE RATE OF THE

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.910
CORPORATIONS THAT DO BUSINESS

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:35.246
IN CALIFORNIA BASE RATE

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:38.716
INCREASE IS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:42.420
CORPORATIONS JUST RECEIVED WHEN

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:47.558
ALL TAX CUT IN OUR PARKING NOW

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.161
FAR MORE MONEY THAN DID THE

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:51.195
PREVIOUS MONTH THAT OTHERWISE.

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.030
TO THE ART. AND THE ONLY TO

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:56.200
RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA YEAH

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:58.436
IN CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. RBC

00:33:58.503 --> 00:33:59.604
PLEA PAYING THE COST FOR THE

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.173
SERVICES THAT EMPLOYEES THEN

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.642
TURN TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:07.278
A WAGE THAT CAN PROVIDE THEIR

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:09.414
FAMILY'S NEEDS SO WE SEE AVERY

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.749
BIG INCREASE IN CALIFORNIANS

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:12.750
WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON MEDI CAL

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:15.386
FOR DEPENDENT ON- VARIOUS OF

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:19.891
OUR SOCIAL SERVICES. ON CAL

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:23.561
FRESHER FOOD STAMP PROGRAM

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:24.595
THOSE KIND OF THINGS SO IT'S

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:27.865
DESIGN NOW. TO RESET BASED

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:29.734
THREE BRING IN SOME NEW REVENUE

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:33.671
BUT IT COULD JUST AS WELL BE

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.773
DESIGNED TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.475
WE INCENTIVIZE AT. INCREASE TO

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:40.745
GET EMPLOYEES NOW AS I

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.079
MENTIONED THE BILL A FAX.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.247
CORPORATIONSTHAT DO BUSINESS

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:45.850
IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S ALSO

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.652
DESIGNED ONLY FOR THOSE THAT.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:52.190
POST A TEN MILLION IN TAXABLE

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.692
INCOME FROM THE BUSINESSES THEY

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.961
DO IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ONLY

00:34:57.028 --> 00:35:00.097
POINT 002% TOTAL CORPORATIONS

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.800
NATIONWIDE OR ABOUT TWO

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.102
THOUSAND SO THIS ONLY AFFECTS

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:05.736
THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ACROSS

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:08.005
THE COUNTRY. SO THE DESIGN

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.373
INVEST THIRTY SEVEN BEFORE YOU

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.375
TODAY RECOGNIZES THAT RELIANCE

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:14.712
ON STATE SERVICES INCREASES

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:15.279
WHEN CORPORATIONS UNDER PAY

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:18.382
THEIR WORKERS. RAISING THAT

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.284
BASE RATE ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.986
CORPORATE INCOME TAX IN

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:23.654
CALIFORNIA AS A PORTION OF OUR

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.424
GENERAL FUND HAS FALLEN TO LESS

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:29.193
THAN 9% OF OUR TOTAL GENERAL

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.729

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.984
WORLD ASSOCIATE WITH ALL OF THE

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:27.852
HIGHEST ASPIRATIONS OF THE

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:30.187
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN TWENTY

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:32.123
EIGHTEEN I WENT TO ANAHEIM IS

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:36.394
BOOKED TO DISNEYLAND WORKERS.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:36.961
HONESTLY SELDOM DOES A MORAL

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:39.564
IMPERATIVE. PRESENTED WITH KIND

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.197
OF CLARITY THAT IT DID THAT FOR

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:40.798
ME THAT DAY. THESE ARE PEOPLE

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.899
THAT I WAS TAUGHT BY MY PARENTS

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:44.135
AND GRANDPARENTS TO RESPECT.

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:46.437
THEY WORK HARD ALL DAY LONG FOR

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.105
A COMPANY THAT IS HISTORICALLY

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.540
PROFITABLE. IN THE WEALTHIEST

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:52.410
NATION ON EARTH AND YET AT THE

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.344
HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH THEY'RE

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.646
PAID SO POORLY. THAT THEY RELY

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.149
ON FOOD BANKS. SLEEPING CARS OR

00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:00.418
LIVE SO CLOSE TO THE BONE THE

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:01.085
EVEN THE SMALL PROBLEM COULD

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:03.120
SEND THEM INTO A DEATH SPIRAL.

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:05.022
SO LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.023
ABOUT DISNEY. AND THIS IS NOT

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.225
ABOUT DISNEY CEO. THIS IS A

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:10.595
PROBLEM OF CORPORATE CULTURE

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.563
FIFTY YEARS IN THE MAKING. THE

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.699
RESULT OF A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.167
TO CONVINCE BUSINESS PEOPLE

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:17.635
PUNDITS POLITICIANS AND THE

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:18.869
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT UP IS

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:21.138
FOUND. WRONG IS RIGHT AND MORE

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:21.706
THAN ANYTHING THAT GREED IS

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.741
GOOD. FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:26.143
GRANDFATHER RAN THE COMPANY THE

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.078
CEO PAY RATIO WAS ROUGHLY

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:30.314
TWENTY TO ONE. IN TWENTY

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:30.781
EIGHTEEN ACCORDING THE

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.650
INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:33.884
FIFTY U. S. CORPORATIONS HOW TO

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:36.520
PAY RATIO OF OVER A THOUSAND.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.922
THAT LIST INCLUDES SOME OF

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.157
AMERICA'S MOST ICONIC COMPANIES

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.993
LIKE WALMART AND MCDONALD'S IN

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.695
THE APTLY NAMED THE GAP WHERE

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:45.930
IT'S AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.632
HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. AMONG

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.500
STANDARD POOR'S FIRMS NEARLY

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:51.369
80% PAY THEIR SEAR YOUR MORE

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:53.304
THAN ONE HUNDRED TIMES THERE

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.672
MEDIAN WORKER PAY AND NEARLY

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:57.508
10% HAD A MEDIAN PAY BELOW THE

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:58.275
POVERTY LINE FOR A FAMILY OF

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.178
FOUR. IN THE FORTY YEARS DURING

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:03.147
WHICH CEO PAY HAS BLOWN BY OVER

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.282
9100% WAGES HAVE BARELY RISEN

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:07.385
ENOUGH TO COVER SKYROCKETING

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:08.185
COSTS THAT THINGS LIKE

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:10.688
EDUCATION HOUSING AND HEALTH

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:11.722
CARE I KNOW YOU ARE ALL WELL

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.190
AWARE OF THESE FACTS. THE

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.259
SOCIAL MOBILITY OF WHICH MY

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.261
GRANDFATHER AND GREAT UNCLE

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:17.795
WERE EXEMPLARS HAS ALL BUT

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:20.831
EVAPORATED. PRAGMATIC REASONS

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:23.701
TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. REALLY

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:24.769
PAID EMPLOYEES ARE LESS

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:26.771
PRODUCTIVE HAVE LOWER MORALE

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.506
AND HIGHER RATES OF TURNOVER

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.540
AND I CAN'T THINK OF THE

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:31.575
BUSINESS THAT NEEDS GOOD MORALE

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.544
OF MORE THAN DISNEY DOES

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:34.512
COMPANIES WITH HIGH PAY GAP

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.781
SPEND LESS ON OUR ANTI TAKE

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.883
RECKLESS RISKS AND SUFFER FROM

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:41.452
SHORT TERM ISM BUT ABOVE ALL.

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.521
THIS IS A MORAL QUESTION.

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.423
SHOULD NOT THE EVERYDAY

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.023
CONSIDERATIONS TAKE A BACKSEAT

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.461
TO THE FACT. THAT SIGNIFICANT

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:50.928
SEGMENTS OF OUR FELLOW

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.297
AMERICANS ARE DROWNING. WHILE

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:54.665
THE REST OF US ARE DINING AT

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:56.333
THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE REFUSING TO

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:56.901
THROW THEM SO MUCH AS A LIFE

00:38:56.967 --> 00:39:00.337
JACKET. THERE IS NOTHING

00:39:00.404 --> 00:39:02.106
INHERENTLYWRONG. WITH BEING

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.541
WELL PAID FOR DEMANDING AND

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:05.509
REALLY AT WORK JUST SO LONG AS

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:08.746
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR YOU. ON

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:09.814
TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.716
SUCCESS FOR WHICH YOU'RE BEING

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:13.150
PRAISE ARE BEING REWARDED

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:15.052
FAIRLY. SO WHO PICKS UP THE

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.120
BILL WHEN THE WORKERS CAN'T

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.122
MAKE ENDS MEET WE DO THE

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.124
TAXPAYERS THEY SUBSIDIZE THINGS

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.026
LIKE THE FOOD BANKS AND THE

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:22.727
HEALTH CARE IN THE HOUSING.%

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.962
THAT WORKERS HAVE TO TURN TO.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.263
AS A REBUTTAL DISNEY OFTEN

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.599
POINTS TO IS A SPIRE PROGRAM

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.167
IT'S A GREAT EDUCATION PROGRAM

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.069
I HAVE NO CRITICISM OF IT BUT

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:34.205
IN ORDER TO ASPIRE TO BETTER

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:34.772
TOMORROW. YOU DO HAVE TO GET

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.508
TODAY. WHAT'S MORE ALL THE

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:38.242
EDUCATE IN IN THE WORLD WON'T

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.377
GET YOUR FLOOR SCRIPT. IF YOU

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:41.545
ARE UNWILLING TO SCRUB THEM

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:43.481
YOURSELF AND IF YOUR ENTIRE

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.483
REPUTATION AS A COMPANY RELIES

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:46.884
ON THE IDEA OF ITS CLEAN

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:48.486
FLOORS. YOU HAD BETTER BE

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.321
WILLING TO PAY YOUR WORKERS

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:52.656
ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB WELL AND

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:53.290
WITH DIGNITY. DIDN'T ANY IS NOT

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.326
A PERK. SO IF YOU WANT TO HELP

00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:57.094
YOUR WORKERS SEND TO BETTER

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.896
PAYING JOBS IN THE FUTURE

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.464
THAT'S GREAT IT DOESN'T RELIEVE

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.566
YOUR OF YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.167
THEM FAIRLY FOR WHAT THEY DID

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.170
TODAY. SOME CONTENT. I DON'T

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:06.904
LIKE THEIR PAY THEY SHOULD JUST

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.306
GO FIND OTHER JOBS. BUT THERE'S

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.941
NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.409
WHEN EVERY OTHER EMPLOYEE

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:13.677
SHARES DISNEY'S VIEW. THAT

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:14.945
WORKERS ARE AN INFINITELY

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:17.047
REPLENISHING SUPPLY OF NAMELESS

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:19.617
FACELESS SPARE PARTS. WE SHOULD

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.218
ALWAYS AND ONLY BE PAID AS

00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:23.087
LITTLE AS THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS.

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:24.488
BRITAIN UNANIMITY ON THIS

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.056
BORDERS ON POLLUTION THERE'S NO

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.591
SUCH THING AS A FREE MARKET

00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.793
WHEN THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE FOR

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:30.961
WORKERS TO GO. THIS IS WHY I'M

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.696
SPEAKING OUT FOR SB THIRTY

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.430
SEVEN IT WOULD BE NICE TO

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.099
IMAGINE THE CORPORATIONS WOULD

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.501
ALL BE NICE. AND DO THIS

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.203
VOLUNTARILY BUT I THINK WE CAN

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.704
BE CERTAIN THAT'S NOT GONNA

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.039
HAPPEN. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.542
CALLS A JOB KILLER AND IT

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:47.812
DEFIES ALL LOGIC I'M STILL

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:48.379
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.446
WOULD BE A JOB KILLER. EVEN

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:50.047
COME WITH MORE MONEY TO INVEST

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.583
IN HIGH. IN CAPITAL

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.686
IMPROVEMENTS THAT'S NONSENSE A

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.054
TAX CODE IS AS MUCH A STATEMENT

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.190
OF SHARED VALUES AS A WAY FOR

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.058
GOVERNMENTS TO GENERATE REVENUE

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.027
SOMETIMES IT USES CARROTS LIKE

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:03.961
TAX BREAKS FOR CORPORATE

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:05.462
BEHAVIOR THAT BENEFITS AT ALL

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.898
AND ALL I AM ALL FOR THAT. BUT

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.533
WHEN FIFTY THREE MILLION

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.268
WORKERS EARN BARELY ENOUGH TO

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.537
LIVE AND C. SUITE EXECUTIVES

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.472
CONTINUE TO BUILD AND REINFORCE

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:17.808
THE STRUCTURE THAT CREATE THESE

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:18.876
PROBLEMS IT'S TIME TO BRING OT

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:21.445
THE STICKS. THIS IS A COMPLEX

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.314
HISTORICAL PROBLEM AND IT WON'T

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.649
BE SOLVED IN ANY SINGLE MATCHER

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:29.019
BUT SB THIRTY SEVEN IS A BIG

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:29.653
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.957

HOW LARGE. A TAX INCREASE THIS

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.059
WOULD BE. IF THE COMPANY'S NET

INCREASE. ANYWHERE FROM UP TO

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:26.930
FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT FOUR

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.900
PERCENT. BASED ON THE RATIO.

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.368
THIS RATE ALONE WHEN NEARLY

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.870
DOUBLE THE STATE'S CURRENT

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:34.471

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:44.681
EMPLOYEES. CALIFORNIA'S TOP

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:45.215
RATE WOULD NOT JUST BE THE

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:45.849
HIGHEST IN THE US WITH A TWENTY

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:48.819
TWO. POINT 26% RATE BUT IT ALL

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:49.853
BUT THIS WOULD EXCEED THE

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.822
AVERAGE RATES OF COUNTRIES IN

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:54.057
ASIA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:54.991
WHICH IS SPECIALLY DISADVANTAGE

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:58.462
AT A DISTANCE JUST A BIG A BIG

00:49:58.528 --> 00:49:58.995
DISADVANTAGE FOR STATE THE

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:01.665
PROBABLY COMPETES GLOBALLY.

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:02.632
COULD ALSO THAT WHEN EXAMINING

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:05.535
THE 50% INCREASE PROVISION IT'S

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.204
NOT HARD COPY EXAMPLES WHERE.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.072
THIS WOULD APPLY TO SITUATIONS

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:10.774
NOT NECESSARILY INTENDED BY THE

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.709
AUTHOR. FOR EXAMPLE A COMPANY

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:13.777
COULD HAVE A PRODUCT THAT

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:14.878
SUCCESSFUL ANOTHER PART OF THE

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:18.048
WORLD. SO IT OPENS UP MORE

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:18.648
RETAILERS MORE RETAIL STORES

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:20.517
MANUFACTURING OR THINGS THERE-

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.452
AND THAT IS A TOTAL SEPARATE

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.221
EITHER FINANCIAL VAN NATURAL.

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:25.689
THE EVENT FEDERAL INTERVENTION

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.724
SOMETHING HAPPENS- IN THE U. S.

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.727
AND IT COULD CAUSE A DECREASE

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.429
EMPLOYEES- THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:35.198
SITUATIONS LIKE THAT. THAT A

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.166
COMPANY WOULD THEN BE PENALIZED

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:39.536
BY 50% HIGH- HIGHER RATE. WHEN

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.972
IT MAY BE IN A SITUATION THAT

00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:42.572
IT'S ACTION NEEDS HELP BECAUSE

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:45.041
IT'S NOT DOING WELL. ON TOP OF

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:45.609
THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:46.743
STATES IN THERE. THE BILL. IN

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.512
REFERENCING THIS PROVISION THAT

00:50:48.578 --> 00:50:49.946
THE THAT QUOTE THIS COULD RAISE

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.448
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AND OF

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:52.582
THE FOREIGN COMMERCE CLAUSE OF

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.351
THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.920
IT COULD APPEAR TO IMPROPERLY

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:57.454
FAVOR U. S. ACTIVITY OVER

00:50:57.521 --> 00:50:59.923
FOREIGN COMMERCE. DESPITE THIS

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.391
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE LET'S

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:03.794
ASSUME THIS IS THAT THIS

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.394
BECOMES THIS IS LAW AND IT'S

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:07.197
LEGAL- THESE COMPANIES TAX

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.265
RATES GO UP AS A RESULT OF THE

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.367
BILL. I'M THE QUESTION IS WOULD

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:13.970
CEO PAY ACTUALLY GO DOWN. AND

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.872
NOT ACCORDING TO WHAT WE'VE

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.707
SEEN RECENTLY- THERE IN THE

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:19.075
CITY IS THEANALYSIS POINTS

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:20.444
OUT. THE CITY PORTLAND

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.479
IMPLEMENTED A VERY SIMILAR-

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.915
MEASURE AND- AN ANALYSIS FOUND

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.317
THAT THERE WAS NO NO EVIDENCE

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:29.186
THAT THE LIGHT ANY IMPACT ON

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.588
CEO. COMPENSATION THERE. AND

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:33.323
ALSO JUST AS A REMINDER LAST

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.791
YEAR CALIFORNIA CONFORM TO A

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:37.093
PIECE. OF FEDERAL TAX LAW THAT

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.627
REMOVED THE DEDUCTION FOR

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.963
EXECUTIVE PAY. INCLUDING

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.698
PERFORMANCE PAY THUS PENALIZING

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:43.467
COMPANIES THE MORE THEY PAY

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.235
THEIR HIGHEST PAID EXECUTIVES.

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:47.270
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:47.838
TOWARDS THIS GOAL LESS THAN

00:51:47.904 --> 00:51:51.074
TWELVE MONTHS AGO. SO THEN WHO

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.576
FEELS THE PAIN OF TAX INCREASES

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:55.011
LIKE THIS TAX INCREASES LIKE

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:55.745
THESE USUALLY OFTEN FALL

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:59.382
EMPLOYEES AND CONSUMERS. I TWO

00:51:59.449 --> 00:51:59.850
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TAX

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.251
FOUNDATION STUDY FOUND THAT THE

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.252
CORPORATE TAX FALLS PROBABLY ON

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.887
LABOR WHICH A GROUP ESTIMATES

00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:06.456
BEARS AT LEAST 70% OR IF NOT

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.958
ALL OF THE BURDEN. AT SOME

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.793
POINT TAX INCREASES ON BUSINESS

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.561
IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS THROUGH

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:13.363
LAST ECONOMIC GROWTH LOWER

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.166
WAGES HIGHER PRICES FEWER JOBS

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:16.933
OR DECREASE RETURNS IN

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.902
RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS. IN

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.837
ADDITION THESE PROBLEMS THIS

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:21.471
TAX BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:24.574
PROBLEMATIC TO IMPLEMENT. AS

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:25.175
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALSO

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:25.842
POINTS OUT IT WOULD TAKE THE F.

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:27.244
T. B. WOULD TAKE UP TO BE

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.080
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT THEY

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:30.680
LIKELY DO NOT HAVE IN ORDER TO

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:33.550
COLLECT ADMINISTER THE TAX. AND

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:34.584
TAX CARE. AND THE TAXPAYERS

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.318
SIDE COMPLAINTS WOULD BE

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.319
NOTHING SORT OF SHORT OF A

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:38.121
NIGHTMARE. ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:38.822
TRYING TO CALCULATE

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.690
COMPENSATION RATIO. AS

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:41.725
GREENHOUSES ALSO NOTES

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:43.660
CORPORATIONS HAVE COMPLEX TAX

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:44.628
RETURNS THAT CAN INCLUDE

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.396
THOUSANDS OF US SUBSIDIARIES

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:47.631
AND AFFILIATES AROUND THE

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.266
ORLD. AND INVOLVE COMPLEX

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.334
UNITARY GROUP DETERMINATIONS

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.937
AND APPORTIONMENT COMPUTATIONS.

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:54.804
ADDITIONALLY THESE COMPANIES

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.139
REGULARLY CREATE MERGING

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.841
DISSOLVE NEW AFFILIATES AND

SUBSIDIARIES AND THROUGH ALL OF

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.912
THIS THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:05.048
FIND A SINGLE MEDIAN SPARE. AND

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.149
THIS IS IN AN EVER CHANGING CUP

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:08.418
CLIMB- FROM DAY TO DAY FOR-

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.920
BUSINESSES. AND YET TO BE

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.421
WITHIN HAVE TO VERIFY THE HAVE

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:12.722
THE RESOURCES TO VERIFY EACH OF

THESE MILLION TAXPAYERS WHO

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:16.159
THEY ARE- THEY WOULD LIKELY

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.861
HAVE TO PERFORM AN AUDIT. AND

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.596
THEN ON TOP OF THAT THEY WOULD

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:20.130
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT THE

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.264
TAXPAYER FELT LIKE THEY WERE

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:24.234
LIKE THERE'S- RATE WAS-

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:25.435
INCORRECTLY DETERMINED. THEY

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.771
COULD FILE- FILE FOR A CLAIM

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:30.774
FOR REFUND WHICH WOULD. AGAIN

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.776
INCREASE THE COMPLIANCE COSTS

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.460
INTERESTING STUDIES BUT I.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:32.094
WONDER IF WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:35.331
THAT. WHERE WOULD WOULD IMPACT

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:40.936
EVEN JUST OUR COSTS THANK YOU.

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:42.805
MISTER ROYSTER FOR THE QUESTION

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.740
SO IS I THINK ALL OF US KNOW

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.909
STOCK RATES ARE YOU KNOW HOW

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:48.544
THE STOCK MARKET RESPONSE TO

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.012
THINGS IS NOT ENTIRELY

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.281
PREDICTABLE AND ISN'T ALWAYS

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:55.918
RATIONAL BUT DE WHAT I THINK IS

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.320
THE REALLY WAY TO ANSWER THIS

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:00.255
IS THAT THE BILL IS DESIGNED

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.057
YES THE WAIT IS CURRENTLY

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:05.127
BEFORE YOU IT DOES INCREASE THE

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:09.164
BASE RATE. ONE LARGE

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:13.135
CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE TAXABLE

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.770
BUSINESS OF HIGHER THAN TEN

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.072
MILLION IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.408
IS A BASE RATE INCREASE NOW

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.343
THIS I OUR FIRST COMMITTEE IT

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.812
CERTAINLY COULD BE DESIGNED SO

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.614
THAT IT DIDN'T INCREASE THAT

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:28.417
BASE RATE. AND IT SAID INSTEAD.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.819
YOU KNOW CORPORATIONS THAT ALL

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.489
OF YOU IN THIS CATEGORY OF-

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:34.423
DOING TEN MILLION OR MORE IN

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.192
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:40.629
HAVE A RATIO BETWEEN YOUR- I'M

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.865
CEO PAY YOUR EXECUTIVE SUITE

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.701
PAY AND YOUR AVERAGE. EMPLOYEE

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:49.338
PAY OF FIFTY OR BELOW WHICH WAS

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.073
EVEN HIGHERTHAN WHAT IT WAS IN

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.108
THE SEVENTIES THEN YOU WILL AND

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.176
YOU WILL HAVE JUST THE SAME

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.678
RATE YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND IN

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.513
FACT THE SENATE DID ENTERTAIN A

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.580
BILL LIKE THAT A NUMBER OF

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.417
YEARS AGO. AND THAT THEN WE

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.751
WOULD PROGRESSIVELY RAISE IT

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.788
JUST AS AN EXAMPLE. BASED ON IF

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:10.325
YOU KEPT YOUR- YOUR DIFFERENCE

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.294
BETWEEN THE CEO PAYING YOUR

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.163
EMPLOYEES A LARGER AND LARGER

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.465
AMOUNTS SO IN THAT KIND OF A

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.834
STRUCTURE. IT'S REALLY UP TO

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.836
THE CORPORATION IF THE

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.371
CORPORATION WANTS TO AVOID THE

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:26.008
HIGHER RATE. THEY COULD MODIFY

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.943
THEIR THE CURRENT COMPENSATION

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.244
TO THEIR EXECUTIVES SANDER

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.014
AVERAGE EMPLOYEE PAY. AND

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.115
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.584
TO INCENTIVIZE NOW AS I STATED

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.387
IN MY OPENING I BUILT IN THE

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:42.357
INCREASE. BECAUSE THOSE SAME

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.793
CORPORATIONS ARE THE ONES THAT

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.229
RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:50.332
FROM A RECENT TAX CUT THAT

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.968
OTHERWISE WAS GOING TO THE IRS.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.937
AND THAT THAT SIGNIFICANT

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:58.407
BENEFIT HAS NOT YET TRANSLATED

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.008
INTO INCREASED PAY TO EMPLOYEES

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:05.481
SO. WITH IT WHEN EMPLOYEES AND

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.348
YOU KNOW LET'S LOOK AT

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.883
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE VERY LOW

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.585
UNEMPLOYMENT SO WE HAVE MOST OF

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.253
OUR CALIFORNIANS ARE WORKING

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.189
AND YET WE HAVE 25% OF PEOPLE

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:14.757
IN VERY EXTREME POVERTY. BUT

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:17.826
THEIR WORK IN. SO THOSE SAME

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.362
PEOPLE ARE THEN USING OUR

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:21.663
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE ARE

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.966
PAYING FOR. AND SO IT'S SORT OF

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.567
LIKE TO CREATE THAT MORE LEVEL

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.169
PLAYING FIELD TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.404
THAT THE TAXPAYER NOW IS FUND

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:32.040
IS HOLDING THAT BILL VERSUS THE

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.909
CORPORATION. SO THAT'S WHY I

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.177
DECIDED THE WAY DID BUT

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.945
CERTAINLY AS THIS BILL MOVES

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.180
FORWARD WE COULD HAVE

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.582
DISCUSSIONS ON SINCE MY PRIMARY

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:43.252
OBJECTIVE. IS TO INCENTIVIZE

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.953
THE CORPORATION SHRINK INCOME

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.322
INEQUALITY I AM HAPPY TO HAVE

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:50.659
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:51.226
A WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS IN A

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:51.827
BETTER WAY THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.997
THAT. I'M I'M CONCERNED TOO

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:58.801
ABOUT WAGE DISPARITY WITHIN

01:13:58.867 --> 01:13:59.968
EVEN SAY THE STATE OF

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.637
CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE LOOK AT

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:03.605
OUR OWN HOUSE THE LA TIMES JUST

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.673
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO CAME OUT

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.408
WITH AN ARTICLE ON THE WORKERS

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:07.709
COMP PROVIDERS STATE

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.645
COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND AND

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.213
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THIS

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.281
WEEK MEETING WITH THEIR CEO

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:14.416
WHO. I WAS REPORTED OF HAVING A

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.451
SALARY OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.654
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR- WELL

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.922
IN EXCESS OF WHAT OTHER STATE

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:23.292
EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING ARE WE

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:23.892
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT OUR OWN

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:27.062
HOUSE WE HAVE. YOU SEE. THAT

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.597
AND WE HAVE YOU SEE COACHES FOR

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:30.232
FOOTBALL TEAMS ARE MAKING IN

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.268
EXCESS OF SIX FIGURES. HI I YOU

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:34.570
KNOW I'M I'M JUST WONDERING HOW

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.872
WE- DEAL WITH THAT WE HAVE

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:38.707
DOCTORS IN OUR SYSTEM OF COURSE

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:42.277
BUT- YOU WANNA TAKE. SHIFTING

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:46.014
YOU WANT TO TAKE. THE REVENUE

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:48.417
AND DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO.

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:51.286
CHILD CARE AND SCHOOLS JUST

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.187
LIKE IT HOW DOES IT INTERFACE

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.022
THEM WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT. SO

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:56.091
THE BILL NOW DOES NOT DEDICATE

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.893
THE REVENUE THE REVENUE

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.127
INCREASE WOULD GO TO THE

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:01.597
GENERAL FUND. BUT AS WE KNOW

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.999
UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT. ANY

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:06.168
INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND A

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.403
MINIMUM OF 40% AND UPWARDS

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.205
GHOST FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:12.341
SCHOOLS SO FROM THAT.

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:13.809
PERSPECTIVE IN INCREASE REVENUE

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.477
WOULD BENEFIT OUR K. THROUGH

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.346
TWELVE SCHOOLS WHAT OTHER

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.281
SERVICES IT BENEFITS WOULD OF

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.183
COURSE THEN BE WHATEVER THE

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.051
BUDGET IS ADOPTED BY THE

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:24.019
LEGISLATURE WHETHER IT GOES TO

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.388
INCREASE CHILDCARE. OR YOU KNOW

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.757
ANY OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.059
OF COURSE WOULD BE UP TO

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:31.693
GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.997
BUDGET BUDGET THAT'S APPROVED.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.798
MAYBE TO MISTER LAPSLEY. BY

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.600
COULD ASK A QUESTION- WE

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:39.401
SHOULDN'T THIS BE AT LIKE A

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.603
SHAREHOLDER MATTER ON HOW YOU

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.973
COMPENSATED CEO AND- I'M JUST

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.777
JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. HOW DO WE

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.379
INCENTIVIZE SAY ABOARD AS A

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:52.047
BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO. A LITTLE

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:56.952
MORE SENSITIVE TO THESE MMHM

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:57.953
MULTIPLIERS THAT ARE UP TO A

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.056
THOUSAND TO ONE SO CENTERED A

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:03.859
COUPLE POINTS CERTAINLY. IT

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.460
SHOULD BE A CHERYL MUCH

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:06.428
SHAREHOLDER MATTER THERE'S NO

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.063
QUESTION ABOUT THAT SOME

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.731
COMPANIES WILL MOVE QUICKER

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:10.265
THAN OTHERS. WHEN YOU TALK

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:14.236
ABOUT. THE GOOD SENATOR HERE

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:14.970
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.205
RECEIVED A TAX CUT. I HAVEN'T

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.573
SEEN THAT TRANSLATE TO PAY

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.875
INCREASES THAT'S NOT

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:22.077
NECESSARILY TRUE THAT IS NOW IS

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:23.578
THERE IS THERE IS PAY INCREASES

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:24.613
HAPPENING THERE ALSO COMPLYING

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.648
WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE. BILL

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:27.616
THAT WAS PASSED BY THE

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.117
LEGISLATURE SO. THAT'S

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:32.154
RESIDENTS IN AUTOMATIC. A PAY

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.655
INCREASE AND THEY'RE ALL PAYING

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:36.158
FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.427
IT'S A VERY AS WE KNOW.

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:40.963
DELEGATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.598
SHAREHOLDERS AND EXECUTIVES C.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:44.866
SUITE EXECUTIVES IS WHAT'S

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.269
BEING SAID. HI I THINK THE REAL

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.405
QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE IS

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:51.306
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU WANT TO

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:54.142
SEND WHAT KIND OF. JOB GROWTH

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.578
CLIMATE DO WE WANT IN THE STATE

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:59.581
WE ARE A FULL EMPLOYMENT NOW-

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:00.549
A- THAT'S BEEN A POSITIVE

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.284
SILICON VALLEY'S BEEN OVER 40%

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.319
OF THAT. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:04.953
PARTICULAR FOR PRIVATE

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.757
COMPANIES HI THEY CAN GO AND

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.360
YOU WILL. PROBABLY NEVER KNOW.

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.095
WHEN A CUT WHEN YOU START TO

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:16.665
GET THESE KINDS. OF LAWS

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:22.204
PASSED. SO. AGAIN WE ARE CALL

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.805
AND I REQUEST IS THAT WE LOOK

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:24.539
AT IT FROM A BROADER

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.675
COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.877
WE REALLY LOOK AT THE POLICY

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:31.146
THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE. EQUALLY

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.114
AND THEN YOU CAN BRING THIS

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.282
ISSUE INTO THAT- BUT LET'S

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.618
MODERNIZE THE TAX SYSTEM LET'S

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:37.753
NOT DO IT AGAIN IN A PIECE BY

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.355
PIECE BASIS- THROUGH THE CHAIR

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.859
MAY I ALLOW MY WITNESS ALSO TO

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.994
ADDRESS THAT QUESTION.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:49.164
STRUCTURE ARE GREAT PLEASE. SO

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.999
I'M DISEASE COMPENSATION

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.969
PACKAGE- WHEN ON- UP OR DOWN

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.771
VOTE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS IN

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.271
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WAS

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.340
REJECTED BY SHAREHOLDERS. BUT

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:00.275
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF MADE IT

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.911
A NON BINDING VOTE. SO CHIRLA

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:05.180
GOVERNANCE IS OF VERY LIMITED

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.783
WAY OF GETTING. THINGS TO

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:08.784
CHANGE INSIDE OF COMPANIES

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.219
ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:13.422
WHERE SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY HAS

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:15.457
BECOME THE ORDER OF THE DAY AND

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:16.458
IN THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.260
ACTUALLY I COMMEND THEM FOR.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.795
THEIR STATEMENT LAST YEAR

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.897
QUESTIONING THE CENTRALITY OF

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.065
THE SHAREHOLDER IS THE PRIMARY

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.200
AND ONLY THAT THE FISHERY OF A

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.602
COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES SO THE

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:28.336
BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS STARTING

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:29.237
TO ASK ITSELF SOME HARDER

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:31.606
QUESTIONS. AND THINK ABOUT THE

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.141
WAYS TO MEASURE SUCCESS BEYOND

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.110
SIMPLY SHARE PRICE AND I THINK

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.179
THAT'S A GOOD NEWS AND FRANKLY

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.748
I WORKED WITH MY FATHER. IN TWO

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:44.186
THOUSAND AND THREE- WE GOT A

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.220
39% MONTH NO VOTE FOR MICHAEL

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:46.855
EISNER WHO STATE BOARD ESTATE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.657
YEAH IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:49.724
OF MAKING CHANGE INSIDE

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.927
COMPANIES- FOR DISNEY THE

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:53.228
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE ON THE SALARY

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.230
NOT THE BOARD OF. NO NO THE

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:56.965
BOARD VOTED ON AND APPROVED IT

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:58.166
CHERYL THIS REJECTED IT BUT IT

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.768
WAS A NON BINDING VOTE. THE

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.570
BOARD WAS FORCED TO GO BACK AND

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.038
MAKE SIGNIFICANT CUTS AND IT

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.272
WAS ONLY JUST BARELY APPROVED

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:06.441
IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WILL THEN

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:10.212
AND DESIGNING. SOME KIND OF YOU

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:10.812
CALL AND SENATE BUT I HAVEN'T

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:15.283
REALLY. I ARMS AROUND THAT WORD

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:16.485
I'D LIKE TO BE. THE CENTER FOR

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.053
BUT- YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. AYBE

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.287
HAVING SOME REPERCUSSIONS TO

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:19.888
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE SB

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.723
THEY HAVE A- SOMETHING AS

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.658
OPPOSED TO PUNISHING THE WHOLE

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.560
CORPORATION AND- THE HIGHER

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.863
TAXES MAY BE PUNISHING THE

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.332
EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES. AS A- BUT

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:35.337
INTO A CONSEQUENCE. WELL DISNEY

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.305
AND IT IS- STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.241
MANY YEARS AGO SO UNFORTUNATELY

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.509
THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.644
AFFECTED BY SHARE PRICE AND

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.546
RIGHT NOW UNDER THE UNDER THE-

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.581
BUT THE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH IS

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:47.816
BEING RUN WHICH ARE THE CHERYL

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.385
TO PRIVACY PRINCIPLES ON THE

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.386
SHAREHOLDERS INTERESTS AND CEOS

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.722
INTERESTS ARE TOTALLY A LOT- IN

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.524
THAT ALL ANYBODY'S LOOKING FOR

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.492
IS A HIGHER SHARE PRICE AND YOU

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.728
KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT-

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.229
THAT'S NOT GONNA BRING ABOUT

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:02.097
THE BEST AND MOST LONG TERM

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.932
DECISION MAKING AND FAT THE

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.233
BENEFIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.401
IS COMPANIES ARE SPENDING LESS

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.503
ON OUR ANTI. TAKING MORE A

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.038
RECKLESS RISKS ARE THINKING IN

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.573
SHORT TERM THE STATE OF

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.042
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T BENEFIT BY

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:14.676
COMPANIES MAKING THOSE KINDS OF

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:18.847
PLACE. WE IN ALSO DRESS MY MAY

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.983
WITH CARE. AS A GOVERNMENT WE

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:26.421
ARE LIMITED IN THE WAYS THAT WE

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:26.955
CAN HAVE A CERTAIN POLICY

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:30.759
OBJECTIVES. BUT TO ACHIEVE THEM

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.694
WE HAVE TO DESIGN THINGS THAT.

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:35.363
ARE LEGALLY THAT YOU KNOW MEET

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:39.668
OUR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. AND

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:43.271
WHILE I IMAGINE. BUT I'M NOT AN

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.940
EXPERT AND I'M SURE IF WE WERE

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:46.174
TO CHARGE OUR COMMITTEE WITH

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.108
TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.977
WAYS THAT WE MIGHT DO A

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.745
REQUIREMENT ON THE BOARDS OF

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:56.785
COMPANIES. YOUR THAT IS A SPACE

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.320
WHERE OUR LEGAL OPTIONS ARE.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.922
MORE LIMITED. SINCE WE DO SET

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:03.558
THE TAX STRUCTURE FOR OUR STATE

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.060
IT IS IT. DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.761
HAVE TO BE THE ONLY WAY. BUT IT

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:12.067
IS A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE. TO A

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.702
TO TRY TO DRIVE GOOD GOOD

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:17.706
BEHAVIOR. NOW AGAIN I RATE I

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.040
SAID IN THE OPENING IS THAT THE

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:21.810
ADDITIONAL REASON THAT I. PUT

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:23.545
IN THE BILL THE RAISING ON THE

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.747
BASE RATE IS BECAUSE WERE OUT

PROFITS WITH. BASICALLY NO ONE

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.488
EMPLOYMENT AND YET 25% OF OUR

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.291
RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY.

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:38.994
AND AS A TOTAL PORTION OF OUR

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.596
GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THIS

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.398
CATEGORY OF TAX THIS CORPORATE

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.899
INCOME TAX THE AMOUNT THAT A

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:46.735
CORPORATION PAYS BASED ON THE

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.136
BUSINESS THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:50.772
IS THERE ARE LOWEST POINT AS A

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:53.608
PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND. SO I

REALIZE THAT I'M TRYING TO IN

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:58.647
THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DESIGNED

CALIFORNIA THAT THIS STATE IS

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:35.483
HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED THROUGH TAX

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.852
CREDITS. CARPOOL STICKERS AND

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.587
THAT'S TESLA. ITS C. E. O. ELON

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:42.557
MUSK WAS- JUST I JUST QUALIFIED

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:43.958
FOR A THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.727
MILLION DOLLAR PAY OUT- JUST

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.930
THE LAST FEW DAYS. I DOUBT IT

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:49.464
THAT COMPANIES EVEN HAD A

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:52.567
TAXABLE INCOME. TAX RETURN YET

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.302
AND SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.939
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE NOT.

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:58.506
SEVEN TAXABLE INCOME BUT WE

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:01.409
STILL HIGHLY COMPENSATING BY

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:02.877
SEVERE MULTIPLES A COMPANY THAT

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:05.580
WERE ACTUALLY. SUBSIDIZING YEAH

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.015
IT'S AN IRRATIONAL HISTORICAL

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.850
ANOMALY THAT I THINK NEEDS

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.118
ADDRESSING THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.653
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ADDRESS IT

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.654
WITH THE SPELL I DON'T THINK IT

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.622
WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH. BUT AS

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:17.192
LONG AS THE VALUE OF A COMPANY

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:18.827
AND A PERSON ARE ONLY SEEN IN

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.462
TERMS OF SHARE PRICE I THINK

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.663
WE'RE GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.098
THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THIS

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.667
INSIDE ARE WE JUST STATE THAT A

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.803
CALCULATED ILAN MUST PERISH- IF

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:31.706

A SENSITIVITY THAT WE HAVE TO

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:59.067
HAVE HOME. I DO THINK THAT

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.068
THERE'S ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.536
MADE. THAT ON ALL SIDES THE

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:06.441
WRONG. QUESTION FROM A PUBLIC

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:07.075
POLICY PERSPECTIVE FROM MY VIEW

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:12.080
IS. WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:12.647
POINT IN HISTORY IN A UNIQUE

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.417
SITUATION. WELL WE WILL SOON

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:18.853
HAVE TRILLION AIRS. WHERE THERE

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.322
IS A TENSION BECAUSE OF THIS

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:26.795
DISPARITY THAT IS- DESTROYS THE

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:29.230
VERY FABRIC OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:30.498
IT'S DEEPER THAN WE'VE EVER

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.801
SEEN EVEN BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:35.103
DUST REALIZATION ALIKE THE RATE

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.938
OF CHANGE THE ABILITY OF THE

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:39.941
GLOBALIZATION LEVEL O CAPTURE

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:42.977
CAPITAL IS EXTRAORDINARY. SO I

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.746
LOOK AT THIS MEASURE NOT IN ITS

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.047
PARTICULARS AND WHETHER IT'S

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.916
GOING TO COST THE F. T. BE MORE

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.684
MONEY ON THE BOARD OF

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:50.318
EQUALIZATION OR WHATEVER GROUPS

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.754
ADMINISTRATIVE. BUT I LOOK AT

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:54.856
IT YET CONTEXT OF MODERNIZATION

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:58.393
AND- WE USED TAXING AND THE

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.128
WORK OTHER PUBLIC POLICIES AS

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.530
TOOLS. AND ME FORD FAMOUSLY

MY PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:08.069
BUY MY CAR. RIGHT THE END OF

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:09.737
THE DAY EVERYTHING THAT WE DO

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:13.408

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:26.087
THE SUN. IF WE HAD CORPORATIONS

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.122
THAT RAN LIKE POLITICAL

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.225
ORGANIZATIONS WE WOULD ORGANIZE

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.694
JANITORS AND CAFETERIA WORKERS

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.829
IN THE PEOPLE THAT THE MOST.

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:37.765
RATHER THAN INCENTIVIZE TO BUY.

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:39.200
ON BY SHEER PROFITS RIGHT HOW

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.502
TO WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE RIGHT

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:41.569
WE ARE BECAUSE WE'D BE WE WANT

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:43.738
THE MOST NUMBER OF VOTES VERSES

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.139
MAKING THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:45.673
FOR THE FEWEST NUMBER OF

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.642
PEOPLE. TO THE QUESTION I LOOK

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.944
AT THIS QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:50.545
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:52.046
FOR A LONG TIME OF ALIGNING

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:54.482
CENTERS. IN MODERNIZING THIS

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.818
STUFF TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.621
GREAT EQUITY AND IF YOU LOOK IS

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:00.788
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.056
THE ENERGY IN THE ENERGY

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:03.191
ALTERNATIVE SPACE FOR MANY

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:05.226
YEARS AND I REMEMBER. WHEN NONE

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:06.628
OF THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.161
COMPANIES HAD SHE

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.429
SUSTAINABILITY OFFICERS NOW

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.164
THEY ALL DO. I'VE SEEN THESE

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.467
FUNDAMENTAL SHIPS THAT A CAR IN

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.168
TERMS OF CULTURAL CHANGES AT

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.503
THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.406
BUSINESS. ROUNDTABLE BEGINNING

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.808
TO CHANGE WHAT THEY DEEM IT YOU

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.510
KNOW TAKES A WHILE THESE THINGS

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:23.912
DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT IF

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:25.413
YOU LOOK IN THE VERY SHORT

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.981
ORDER THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:30.118
SHIFT IN SO I. MY JUDGMENT ON

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:32.587
THIS IS THAT ALSO CORPS. COULD

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.556
YOU. JUST MENTIONED CENTER BELL

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:36.891
MAYBE MAKE IT A TAX REVENUE

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.761
REVENUE NEUTRAL TO REWARD THE

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:44.265
COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING BETTER

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:44.866
BEHAVIOR. I'M NOT ONLY TO THE

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:49.037
RIGHT ANSWER. YOU KNOW. THE

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.605
MONTH NOTHING FURTHER THAT IT.

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:52.640
BEARS A AN INTELLIGENT. NON

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:53.741
TONAL CONVERSATION THAT WE ALL

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:54.742
NEED TO SURVIVE WE ALL NEED TO

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:55.343
TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER AT A

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.678
MUCH DEEPER LEVEL THAT PEOPLE

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.846
ARE REALIZING THAT AND WHETHER

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:00.248
IT'S THIS SORT OF TAX POLICY

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.417
WOULD OTHER SORT OF TAX POLICY

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.419
THE NOTION IS TO ALIGN

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.688
INCENTIVES OR REMOVE

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.589
DISINCENTIVES WHATEVER THE CASE

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:10.458
MAY BE. COURAGE INVESTMENT TO

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:13.161
ENCOURAGE SAVINGS TO ENCOURAGE

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:15.496
AND AVOID THIS SMALL BOX

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:16.431
CHRISSY IS THE TERM THAT I USE

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.099
THAT WE COULD ULTIMATELY GET.

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.901
BY VIRTUE OF THIS DOWNWARD

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:22.170
SPIRAL YOU KNOW FOLKS JUST

01:27:22.236 --> 01:27:23.638
CAN'T KEEP INSULATING

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:25.406
THEMSELVES IT'S GOT IT WE HAVE

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:26.808
TO HAVE A SOCIETY THAT WORKS IN

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.810
THESE. THESE TERROR THE FABRIC

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.378
OF WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.447
THAT THE BALANCE HAS TO EXIST.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.316
AGAIN WHAT THAT IS BUT I DO IT

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:36.217
IN THAT SENSE THAT I THINK THAT

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:38.319
IT'S AN HONORABLE CONVERSATION.

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:39.354
AT THE TONE HAS TO BE

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.355
RESPECTFUL OF ALL SIDES NOT

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.623
THAT I'M STICKING IT TO YOU

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.891
YOU'RE STICKING IT TO ME BUT WE

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.560
ALL CARE ABOUT ONE THING THAT

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.327
THIS DEMOCRACY WORKS OF THIS

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:47.762
EQUITY AND FAIRNESS OF THE

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:49.497
MARKETS ON THE ANYBODY

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:50.765
DISAGREES WITH THAT. BASICALLY

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.900
MADE THAT STATEMENT IN. YOUR

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:54.502
OLD I THINK. IS WE DEBATE THESE

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.337
THINGS INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:58.806
SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK THE

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:01.242
TOUGH QUESTIONS IS WE ENGAGE IN

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.477
THIS LARGER. LARGER DYNAMIC I

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:05.647
JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT IS I

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:07.348
THINK THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:07.882
THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.118
TRYING TO FIGURE. IT'S

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:16.324
THORNBERG. YEAH ABSOLUTELY A X.

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:16.958
ON SOME OF THE TOUGHEST ISSUES

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:17.525
DOES THE DEEP DIVE TO BETTER

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:18.626
BRING BACK EVIDENCE BASED

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:19.494
SOLUTIONS APPRECIATE THAT VERY

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.395
MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BETTER TURN

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.763
THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR BELL

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.131
CENTRE WINNER IN CENTER NIELSEN.

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:30.004
SOME REPRESENTING THE AREA I DO.

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.538
I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:33.775
THINGS THAT. SILICON VALLEY ARE

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:37.812
APPLIED TO. WAIT CORPORATE

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:40.682
BEHAVIOR OF HERS IN MY AREA.

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:44.819
YEAH. EITHER BENEFITS OR

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.155
DOESN'T BENEFIT THE ECONOMY I

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.823
THINK BENEFITING THE ECONOMY

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.425
SHOULD BE PART OF OUR

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.560
DISCUSSION OF THE CORPORATE TO

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.262
ALL INCOME TAX STRUCTURE I

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:56.898
BELIEVE THAT. THANK ARM I

01:28:56.964 --> 01:29:01.169
BELIEVE THAT. BENEFITING

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:05.373
ECONOMY MEANS TO ME. HIRING

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.576
PEOPLE EMPLOYING PEOPLE FAIR

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:16.284
WAGES. OUR CORPORATE PROFITS.

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:20.822
CORPORATE GROSS. HAVING ABILITY

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:24.225
TO FUNCTION IN THE STATE.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:26.360
SUCCESSFULLY AN IN COMPETITION

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.429
WITH ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:30.431
THINK THOSE ARE PRINCIPLES YOU

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.434
KNOW WHEN WE WANT A- LOOK AT

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:36.404
THE TAXATION PRINCIPLES THAT WE

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:37.505
SHOULD ESTABLISH FOR THE

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:39.207
CORPORATE INCOME TAX WE OUGHT

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:40.575
TO LOOK AT THAT. CLOSELY

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:43.311
FAIRNESS IS A PRINCIPAL.

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:50.885
COLLECTION IS A PRINCIPAL. BUT

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:51.419
WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT WAY

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:56.557
THINGS ARE NOW. I THINK THERE'S.

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.659
LEAGUE CAUGHT LEAKAGE

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:02.697
LOOPHOLES- MAYBE ENCOURAGEMENT

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:05.166
OF SOME BEHAVIORS THAT ARE NOT

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:08.603
MORALLY ACCEPTABLE. MORALLY

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:11.873
ACCEPTABLE AND. I THINK ONE OF

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:16.844
THEM IS THAT. SAU RESERVES THE

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.913
INCUMBENT EXECUTIVES BASED ON

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:26.287
MARKET CAPITALIZATION. WE'RE

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.421
PART OF THE MARKET

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:28.923
CAPITALIZATION TACTIC IS TO LAY

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:34.495
OFF PEOPLE. I THINK IS A. MORAL

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:37.298
DILEMMA IN THAT TAX STRUCTURE

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:37.899
THAT WE HAVE NOW SO WE WANT TO

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:41.903
DISCOURAGE. LAYING OFF PEOPLE

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:42.370
WHO WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:45.907
INVESTMENT REINVESTMENT. IN THE

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:49.777
BUSINESSES IN THE COMPANY- WE

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:50.344
WANNA COURAGE OF HIRING MORE

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:54.549
EMPLOYEES. BUT MARKET

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:59.954
CAPITALIZATION BONUSES. AT

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:05.760
OBSCENE LEVELS. THREE HUNDRED

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:08.963
FORTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS. IF

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.665
THE MARKET VALUE IN THE

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:12.400
CAPITALIZATION OF THE VALUE OF

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:13.000
THE COMPANY GOES TO A CERTAIN

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:15.570
LEVEL. AND AT THE SAME TIME

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:18.439
THAT YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:21.175
IS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:21.776
HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LAID OFF

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.878
FROM THE SAME COMPANY I DON'T I

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.447
DON'T I DON'T I SEE THAT'S A-

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.048
THAT'S THE DILEMMA IN THE TAX

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:31.986
STRUCTURE. SO THE QUESTION IS.

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:36.023
IS THIS A WAY TO. DO WITHOUT-

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.626
IS JUST ONE WAY OF DEALING WITH

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:39.227
THAT HOW DO WE DO WITH THAT

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:42.129
PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN A AND I'M

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:44.966
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LAOS. I'M

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.133
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.469
ECONOMY GOES SOUTH. IN

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:54.842
CALIFORNIA THAT. RATHER THAN.

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:58.512
CUT THE EXECUTIVE PAY. WE'RE

01:31:58.579 --> 01:31:59.113
GONNA START TO BE LAID OFF BY

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.083
THESE COMPANIES. I CAN I CAN BE

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:05.453
IN VISION OF FUTURE. WERE THE

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:08.856
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD GO UP.

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.558
YET THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVES

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:16.931
ARE STILL MAKING WHICH IS A-

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:17.465
SIXTY SIX. HIGH TIMES THE

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:22.270
MEDIAN SALARY. HELLO SO- I

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:22.904

KINDS OF THINGS IS GOOD FOR THE

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:40.922
ECONOMY I DON'T THINK I CAN'T.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.690
SEE HOW IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:45.026

IT A YES WE ABSOLUTELY GREAT

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.049
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER

THE OTHER WAY THIS BILL. IS

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.930
DESIGNED IN AGAIN DRIVER

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:57.798
PERFECT DESIGN NO AND THIS IS

01:33:57.865 --> 01:33:59.767
WHY I THINK THESE KINDS OF

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.235
HEARINGS AND OUR WHOLE. PROCESS

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.971

ADEQUATE INCOMES AND HIGH DEBTS

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.482
IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO OUR

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.384
ECONOMY. THEY ARE NOW WORKING

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.919
SO WE'VE NOT KILL JOBS THERE

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.221
HAS BEEN JOB GROWTH HE'S

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:22.023
CALIFORNIANS ARE WORKING. BUT

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:23.924
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO SPEND IN

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:26.060
THE ECONOMY THE WAY THAT YOU

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.094
WOULD EXPECT BECAUSE THEIR

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:30.598
WAGES ARE LOW. AND A THE

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:33.367
EXECUTIVE SUITE MAKING THE-

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:35.069
WIND SHEAR OF THE WAGES WHILE I

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.137
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:37.671
PEOPLE BEING RICHER MAKING A

01:34:37.738 --> 01:34:39.540
LOT OF MONEY. THAT IS NOT

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:40.975
REINVESTED IN THE CAR TO MEET

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:44.779
THE SAME WAY THAT. A LARGER

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.747
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING THAT

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.749
HAVE MORE MONEY AND SPENDING IN

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:50.951
THE ECONOMY DOES RIGHT SO. HARD

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:51.519
THIS IS ALSO TRYING TO DEAL

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:53.721
WITH THAT. WE KNOW THAT OUR TAX

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:58.926

COMMENTS HERE TODAY. AND THOSE

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.324
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS REFLECT

THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT. IS

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.461
TRYING TO TAKE A MORE SIMPLE

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.396
APPROACH TO ONE OF THE MOST

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:12.533
COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WE FACE ON

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.601

CAN'T AFFORD A HOME BECAUSE WE

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:25.513

ISSUES AT PLAY IN CALIFORNIA

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:36.590
SOCIETY. THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.859
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:40.427

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.766
WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN A DYNAMIC

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:47.735
SOCIETY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:51.739
YOU KNOW THEY- THE ABILITY TO

OUR SOCIETY THROUGH OUR TAX

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:58.212

MODERNIZED IN A THOUGHTFUL

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:02.883
APPROACH IN SITTING DOWN AND IF

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.618
IT IS THE INTENT. OF THE

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:06.921
LEGISLATURE TO REFLECT VALUES

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.656

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.629
AND THEN LET'S LOOK AT HOW

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:18.899

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.178
THEY HAD A RULE CALL THE

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:06.814
ATTACKER GOLDEN RULE. AND THE

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.085
GOLDEN RULE WAS. DID YOU GET A

GOING TO GROW AND I'M GOING TO

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.631

AS- CAPTAIN THE SHIP PART OF MY

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:37.111
FAMILY. THAT WAS THE ETHIC THAT

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:39.246
THEY HAVE SO I DON'T THINK THE

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:44.385
CORPORATE TAX CODE HAS TO BE. I

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:44.918
THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:47.421
PRINCIPLES I THINK IT HAS TO.

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:48.722
MORAL OF THOSE I DON'T THINK IT

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.624
SHOULD BE A MORAL. SO I THINK

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.392
WE ARE THAT WE AUTO LIMóN

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:55.229
EIGHT. THOSE PARTS OF IT THAT

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:58.432
ARE NOT GOING IN TWO DIRECTIONS

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.200
THAT I THINK IN MY OPINION

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:03.370
VIOLATE THE GOLDEN RULE. THE

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:03.971
GOLDEN RULE YOU STAB IN THEIR

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:08.042
COMPANY. AND IT WAS A LASTING

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:10.411
RULE TO THE FAMILY LEFT TO THE

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:13.447
LEFT OF. SO I TAKE A OF I TAKE.

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:14.948
THOSE ARE KIND OF OLD SCHOOL

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:16.417
KIND OF PHILOSOPHIES I HAVE BUT

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:17.518

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:19.820
THINK THE BUSINESSES AND

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:22.389
SILICON VALLEY. HAVE SOMEONE.

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:27.227
TIMES. THIS RULE AND SOMETIMES

01:39:29.997 --> 01:39:33.434
INTO TO INSIST ON REINVESTMENT.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:38.038
HIRING EMPLOYEES. NOT BEING SO

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:12.125
POSING SOME DRAMATIC. NO TAX

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:15.195
BUT IT'S NOT. I THINK IT'S

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:15.729
DRAMATIC AS AS SOME HAVE.

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:19.099
SUGGESTED. I ALSO WHEN I PLEASE

TIRED OF HEARING ME TALKING

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:25.606
ABOUT- TALK ABOUT HOUSING BUT-

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.541
IT IT IS A HUGE ISSUE AND WE

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.109
ARE DEFINITELY DRIVING PEOPLE

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.611
IN THE POVERTY WITH THE COST OF

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.079
HOUSING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FOR

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:33.514

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.118
PUSHING PEOPLE IN THE POVERTY

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:40.821
AND HOMELESSNESS. BUT THE OTHER

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:44.391
PIECE OF THAT. IS THE LACK OF

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.159
INCOMES RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:47.995

ECONOMIC LADDER IT BECOMES

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:59.006
HARDER AND HARDER AND IT DOES

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:01.708
REQUIRE US TO. DO MORE HOUSING

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.510

COLLABORATIVE. AND KNOW THAT

WILL BE THE CASE IN THIS

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:57.163
SITUATION AS WELL. BOTTOM LINE

01:48:57.230 --> 01:49:00.834
IS S. INCOME INEQUALITY IS

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:01.468
NEVER BEEN GREATER IN THE STATE

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:03.536
IN THIS NATION. I AND I A AM

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:07.040
NERVOUS. I BELIEVE THIS INCOME

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.675
INEQUALITY IS GONNA CAUSE

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:11.811
TREMENDOUS AND REST. HERE IN

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.380
CALIFORNIA AS WELL THROUGHOUT

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:16.750
THE NATION IF WE DON'T TACKLE.

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:17.317
INCOME INEQUALITY ESPECIALLY

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:20.553
IMPACTS WOMEN. TWO THIRDS OF

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.054
MINIMUM WAGE EARNERS IN

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:25.492
CALIFORNIA I WENT. IN PACKS. MY

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:26.126
FAMILY MY MOM WAS A BANK TELLER

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:28.995
FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. HER

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:31.498
PENSION IN THE BANK AFTER TWO

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:32.098
DECADES IS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:35.402
ONE BUCKS A MONTH. IF YOU ARE

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:39.439
LIVING IN THE BAY AREA. EARNING

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:40.073
FIFTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR YOU HAVE

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.142
TO WORK THREE FULL TIME JOBS.

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:42.742
TO BE ABLE TO FOR THE AVERAGE

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:47.047
RENT. SKINNER POINTED OUT IN A

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:49.249
MEETING THAT I HAD WITH HER.

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:49.816
THE REASON WHY THERE ARE SO

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:52.319
MANY KIDS IN DEEP POVERTY. IN

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:52.886
THE STATE IS BECAUSE WE PAY

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:55.422
WOMEN TO LITTLE. WE'RE NOT

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:59.693
KEEPING UP. AND THERE'S A GREAT

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:05.165
DISPARITY. WE ALSO NEED TO TALK

01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:05.732
ABOUT FEDERAL ACTION ON TAX

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:09.602
CUTS. TAX CUTS WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:13.440
HELP WITH INCOME INEQUALITY. A

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:14.040
FEDERAL MINISTRATION SAID THAT

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:16.943
THE AVERAGE MIDDLE INCOME

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:18.745
WORKER WOULD RECEIVE

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:19.779
APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:22.816
DOLLARS IN THESE TAX CUTS. THAT

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:23.450
WOULD BE ABOUT A 7% RISE IN PAY

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:26.753
ON AVERAGE. THUS FAR WE SEEM TO

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.521
TWO POINT EIGHTY THREE POINT

01:50:28.588 --> 01:50:29.122
SIX PERCENT. SO I CAN HIT THE

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:32.425
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. CAN WE

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:35.061
TAKE A LOOK AT. GDP I WAS

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:37.664
SUPPOSED TO HELP THIS NATION.

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:40.066
ARE IT HAS BEEN A MINOR BUMP IN

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.735
GDP DEPENDING ON THE STATE

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:45.338
ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO POINT 43%

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:46.906
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE

01:50:46.973 --> 01:50:47.440
DOLLARS ARE GOING HELPING

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:51.111
PROFIT. IT'S NOT HELPING THE

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:53.446
BOTTOM LINE WORKERS AND THAT IS

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:55.548
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT NONPARTISAN

01:50:55.615 --> 01:50:56.116
ANALYSIS SOME OF THESE TAXES

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:57.183
ARE GONNA BE. ITS RECORD

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.285
PROFITS. AND IT IS A DEEP

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:03.656
CONCERN. ARE WE PERFECT IN HERE

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:04.124
ARE WE PERFECT HERE IN

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:07.627
CALIFORNIA YEAH. BUT WE HAVE

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.662

SUPPORTING CHILDREN IT'S JUST

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.566
THAT. THE HIGHEST RATE OF

POVERTY IN OUR STATE IS AMONGST

IS TRYING TO. AS I'VE ALREADY

01:52:37.617 --> 01:52:39.686
INDICATED. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:42.889
HOW WE AS A STATE RECONCILE.

01:52:42.956 --> 01:52:44.824

WORKING. WE DO NOT HAVE IT.

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:52.132
THERE'S STILL SOME UNEMPLOYMENT

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:52.966
BUT BASICALLY NOTHING LIKE

01:52:53.032 --> 01:52:57.003
WE'VE HAD N THE PAST. IN YET

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:57.570
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF OUR

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.157
POSITIVE GENERAL FUND REVENUES

INTO IT. WE ARE. EXPANDING THE

01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:22.095
SUBSIDIZATION OF CHILDCARE. WE

CALIFORNIANS. WORKING

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.485
CALIFORNIA TO DO NOT. EARN

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:48.855
ENOUGH TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:51.958
YET. THEY'RE IN I AM NOT

01:53:52.025 --> 01:53:57.063
TRAINED I. TRYING TO MAKE

01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:58.331
COMPANIES BAD OF PLAYERS OR

01:53:58.398 --> 01:53:59.365
MAKE IT THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE

01:53:59.432 --> 01:54:00.366
PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY PAID WELL

01:54:00.433 --> 01:54:01.801
AND EVEN A C. E. O. WHOSE

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:05.705
COMPENSATED IN THE- MILLIONS.

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:08.408
RATHER I WANT TO TRY TO SEE HOW.

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:11.311
WE CAN DESIGN A STRUCTURE SET

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:12.946
THOSE CORPORATIONS AT THE TIME

01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:14.581
THAT THEY'RE RECORDING RECORD

01:54:14.647 --> 01:54:16.783
PROFITS AND PAYING THEIR CEO'S

01:54:16.849 --> 01:54:20.253
MORE THAN EVER. WILL ALSO

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:20.987
INCREASE THE PAID OF THEIR

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:23.756
WORKERS. AND CERTAINLY MINIMUM

01:54:23.823 --> 01:54:26.426
WAGE IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT. AND

01:54:26.492 --> 01:54:27.961
BUT IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:30.697
SAME ENTITIES THAT CAME BEFORE

01:54:30.763 --> 01:54:32.465
US OPPOSING THIS BILL NOT ALL A

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:34.234
FEW OF THEM WERE WE WERE ABLE

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.568
TO CUT A DEAL AROUND MINIMUM

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:38.204
WAGE. BY IN LARGE OPPOSE

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:40.573
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES SO

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.008
THAT'S THE KIND OF DILEMMA WERE

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:44.410
IN THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO TRY

01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:45.912
TO ADDRESS THAT. AND I WILL

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:47.547
INTERESTINGLY POINT OUT THE

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:50.183
POLLS ACROSS THE NATION SHOW

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:52.852
THAT AMERICANS BY 80% AND

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:56.856
HIGHER. FUEL THAT C. E. O. PAY

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:58.458
HAS BECOME EXORBITANT AND FEEL

01:54:58.524 --> 01:55:01.361
THAT. I'M REGULAR WORKERS PAID

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:04.097
BETTER AND THAT IS POLLS ACROSS

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:06.833
THE US IN NUMBERS OF 80% AND

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:09.502
HIGHER. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:12.705
THAT WE HAD SUCH A VERY HEALTHY

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:15.808
DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE OTHER

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:18.278
INPUT ON DESIGNING SUCH THINGS

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:20.513
ARE AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THESE

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.815
ISSUES. BUT I THINK THE

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.951
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF TRYING TO

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:28.154
INCENTIVIZE CORPORATIONS TO PAY

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:30.890
EMPLOYEES BETTER. AND SORT OF

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:33.660
EQUALIZE THAT GAP BETWEEN. HI

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:41.167
STRATEGY BUT I AM VERY OPEN TO

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:42.302
LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL

01:55:42.368 --> 01:55:43.936
STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THESE

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.672
GOALS AND WITH THAT. I
