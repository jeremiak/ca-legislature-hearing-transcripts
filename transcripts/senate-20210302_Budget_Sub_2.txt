THIS PROGRAM FUNDS MULTI BENEFIT WATER QUALITY WATERSHED PROTECTION AND RESTORATION PROJECTS TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND HABITATS FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON STEELHEAD AND OTHER SPECIES. MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE FISH SPECIES ARE HIGHLY THREATENED DUE TO HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION. I'M A CHANGES EXACERBATING THESE THREATS WITH LONGER AND MORE FREQUENT DROUGHTS REDUCED SPRING FLOWS AND HIGHER SUMMER TEMPERATURES. THE REQUESTED FUNDS WILL HELP US ADVANCE THE URGENT WORK OF RESTORING THE CENTRAL VALLEY'S RIVER SYSTEMS TO HELP RECOVER THESE IMPERILED SPECIES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS THROUGH A RIGOROUS AND TRANSPARENT PUBLIC SOLICITATION PROCESS PROJECT WILL BE SCREENED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO.

OF THE PREPARED DEPUTY NORRIS AND- PEACH THIRTY OF OUR STAFF REPORT WE TALK ABOUT THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET YOU DID GET. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF VOLUNTEER. VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WE DID GET SEVENTY MILLION OR FIFTY MILLION OUT THE DOOR TWENTY MILLION REMAINS. WHAT'S THE PLAN ON THAT TWENTY MILLION IT HASN'T BEEN ALLOCATED YET BEFORE WE GIVE YOU. A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION MORE. IS THAT. I'M SURE VALLEY I WAS GONNA ASK THE SAME QUESTION BUT I'LL ASK YOU. SURE WE'VE HELD THAT BACK TO SUPPORT THE KLAMATH DAM REMOVAL PROJECT WE ACTUALLY DON'T EXPECT TO NEED IT BUT WE'RE HOLDING IT FOR THAT PROCESS. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION- BELIAU. LET'S SEE. MISS OUR IS GOOD GOOD MORNING NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN AT EIGHT AM YES GOOD MORNING MISTER THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS NICE TO SEE YOU AS WELL- RETAILERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THE ISSUE HERE IS REALLY HOW MUCH DISCRETION YOU WANT TO GIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THESE FUNDS- THAT THE BOND ALLOWS SEVERAL DIFFERENT USES AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION ISN'T PROPOSING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE KINDOF TO LIMIT THOSE USES SO- WE WILL SUGGEST YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING SOME ADDITIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THIS IS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REFLECTS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES OF. AS WELL SO ADD THAT LANGUAGE COULD INCLUDE REQUIRING A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS IT COULD INCLUDE SOME OF THEIR PRIORITIES AROUND WHICH THAT GRANT PROCESS SHOULD BE STRUCTURED- AND HOW THE FUNDS SHOULD BE USED AND THE BOND ALSO ALLOWS THESE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR FIVE SEPARATE STATE WIDE COMMITMENTS THOSE ARE THE SOLVENCY- THE KLAMATH HYDROELECTRIC SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS AS A DOCTOR NORRIS MENTIONED THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER RESTORATION AND SETTLEMENT ACT AND THE TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING COMPACT SO SHOULD ANY OF THOSE FIVE BE PRIORITIES FOR YOU AS WELL YOU COULD DIRECT SOME OF THE FUNDS TO BE USED- FOR THOSE SO GIVEN GIVEN A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE MET AND THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE COULD IMAGINE TIME COMING UP WITH THAT A SIX PRIORITY THAT WE HAVE SENATOR DOLLY YOU HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I CONCUR WITH THOSE STATEMENTS AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE. US MORE OVERSIGHT IN THE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE DISCRETION AND NOT JUST GIVE ALL THE. THE AUTHORITY TO THE AGENCY. ALL NOT SAYING CENTER. ARE A HAND WE'RE GOING TO THIS MATTER TO KEEP OPEN OBVIOUSLY WE WENT TO HAVE ROBERT DISCUSS WITH ADVENT ON IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYBODY'S TESTIMONY- BEFORE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY- SIX LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM MISS ROY WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE- MY CASKEY HERE I KASKY HERE DOLLY. DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE YOUR WITH MY HANDS. OKAY IT'S A QUORUM ASSIST IS VERY. WHAT MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO SIX THE POP INVOICE LICENSE FUND AND HEALTH- WE MAY SPEND THE MONEY. I BELIEVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE BRIAN CASH AGAIN GOOD MORNING ASSISTANT LEARNING SECTOR SECRETARY. A DEMONSTRATION PROPOSES THE ITEMS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE AGENDA USING ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND- DURING THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT- WE HAD LEGAL COUNSEL REVIEW THESE USES A FIREMAN A LICENSE PLATE FUND AND THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT THEY SUPPORT IDENTIFIABLE PROJECTS PROGRAMS. AND ASSOCIATED COSTS THAT MEET THE PURPOSES LISTED IN THE YELP STATUTE IN ADDITION THESE PROPOSALS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED IN THE PAST INCLUDING THE BOLSA CHICA RESTORATION PROJECTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND FUNDING FOR THE SAN DIEGO CONSERVANCY'S MAIN OPERATING COSTS SINCE ITS INCEPTION. AND WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THAT'S FUNNY WE HAD LEGAL COUNSEL WEIGH IN ON THIS ONE ALSO LET'S GO TO THE ALLEY- WE CONTINUE RIGHT ALONG WE HAVE- TO. RETAILERS YES I- SO TO COME FOR YOU ABOUT THIS ITEM THE FIRST RICK THE FOR BACK. AND UNDER MINISTRY PROPOSAL THERE IS A RESERVE BUT IT'S REALLY SMALL TWO POINT ONE MILLION. ESTIMATED WHICH IS ONLY 3% OF REVENUE SO THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THIS ECONOMY THERE THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND EVERYTHING BUT ALSO AROUND HOW MANY PEOPLE WALK TO HAVE PRSONALIZED OR LEGACY LICENSE PLATE SO THERE COULD BE SOME REVENUE UNCERTAINTY. SO JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SMALL OF A RESERVE AND PROJECTED. AND THEN THE SECOND LARGER ISSUE IT IS THE ONE THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED EXTENSIVELY IN YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS JUST THAT FOR SOME OF THAT PROPOSED USES- THERE IS SOME QUESTION OVER THE- APPROPRIATENESS OF THE USE OF THE FUND FOR THESE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE LARGEST ONE BEING THE MOVE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDING. BUT THEN ALSO SOME ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE SAN DIEGO CONSERVANCY AS WELL AS THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION. SO WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS YOU COULD RESPOND TO ADDRESS THIS THE FIRST AND PROBABLY MOST STRAIGHT FORWARD WOULD BE TO JUST SWAP THIS EMPF FUNDING FOR GENERAL FUND ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET FOR WHAT ARE SOME CLEARLY ALLOWABLE USES- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S TWENTY MILLION PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET FOR- PARKS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH A YEAR LATER IN YOUR AGENDA. SO YOU COULD EASILY JUST TAKE THIS FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION TOTAL FOR THESE THREE- ITEMS THAT THAT'S CLEARLY- ANY UP YEP ALLOWABLE USED PARKS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SWAB THAT AND THEN USE THAT GENERAL FUND FOR THESE COSTS SO THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO FIND ALL THESE ACTIVITIES IF YOU WANTED TO NOT SPEND ANYMORE FROM EITHER SOURCE BUT HAVE SOME CLEARLY ALLOWABLE- ALIGNMENT. ANOTHER OPTION YOU COULD PURSUE WOULD BE FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES MOVING BILL THAT THAT BUILDING MADE AT LEAST. TO TRY AND SPREAD THE COSTS ACROSS ALL OF THE FUNDS SOURCES THAT SUPPORT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEPARTMENT SO GENERAL FUND YEP YEP AND ALL THE SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THAT THAT SEEMS. LIKE A MORE DEFENSIBLE USE SO FIVE FUNDS TO SUPPORT OF THE ACT. IT WOULD BE MORE. COMPLEX AND COULD RESULT IN IT JUST COST FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT. FUNDS ALTHOUGH USE LESS YEP YEAH IF YOU'RE CAN. ABOUT THE FUN BACK SO YOU HAVE SOME OPTIONS HERE TO ADDRESS- SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. WHEN I WAS READING THE STAFF REPORT IT BROUGHT ME BACK TO LAW SCHOOL ONE WE WOULD THINK SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE THIS MINORITY ARGUMENT TO SAY WELL IT COULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE. SERVICES THERE SO THEREFORE THAT'S THE LINK AND- YOU LOOK AROUND YOU THINK YOU TAKE A BIG DEEP BREATH- THANK YOU FOR THAT INPUT. HELPS CLARIFY. THE ISSUE BEFORE THE- SUBCOMMITTEE CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I. FIRST OFF LIKE THIS COMMENDED THE ITEMS IDENTIFIED ARE CLEARLY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH- BUT THE ONES THAT ARE MOVING FOLKS FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER IF YOU TOLD THAT TO THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THESE LICENSE PLATES THAT THEY WERE. FUNDING MOVEMENT OF STAFF FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER I THINK YOU WOULD FIND THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NON RENEW. BECAUSE I THINK THEY REALLY WANT THE- MONEY TO GO TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND SELL FOR THOSE REASONS. I CAN KERR WE SHOULD TAKE IT ON THE GENERAL FUND. AND ALLOW THE LICENSE PLATE FUND GO TO WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO GO THANK YOU. NOW STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ISSUE. MEMBERS IS THIS SERVICE. SPLIT THIS IN HALF HOLD MEMBERS- ARE HORRIBLE ITEMS AS N. WHICH FOR- THE IS- THE MOVE FOR THAT- NATURAL RESOURCES WITH IS A LIE SURE THE LITTLE THAT'S A- BILL. THE DELTA PROTECT A PROTECTION I COMMISSION WHICH IS- AND IN THE SAN DIEGO RIVER CONSERVANCY THE HISSES SMALL MOUTH I GET THAT RIGHT ACMD CORRECT IT AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS VICE CHAIRED DAHLIAS AND NUMBER EIGHT EIGHT THE ACTUAL. SO THE SAFE BET FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WHICH SHOULD BE THE BOLSA CHICA LOW LAND RESTORATION PROJECT THE SAN DIEGO- CONSERVANCY ONE TIME- APPROPRIATION SAID TO YOU. GRAPH ON WATER QUALITY AND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN BASIN WATERSHED SO- WE'RE GOING TO PARTIALLY HOLD THIS MATTER AND PARTIALLY APPROVE IT AND WILL DO A SEPARATE VOTE A SEPARATE DISCUSSION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION P. ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN FORMALLY KNOWN AS DOCTOR CAL JIM OVERSIGHT. LAST YEAR THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD WE LANDED ON TWENTY FIVE AND NOW WE'RE BACK FOR A TWENTY SIX IS SET FORTH IN THE STAFF REPORT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A DIRECTOR. SHOULD BOSNIA. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND pI'M I'M DAVID SHOULD BE EASY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO PRESENT OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- THIS IS FOR THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION FORMALLY KNOWN AS DOCTOR- WE ARE REQUESTING TWENTY SIX POSITIONS AND A BASS LINE INCREASE OF JUST OVER FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE FINE. AND HAVE THIS PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS FUNDING THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP CAL JIM CONTINUE TRANSFORMING ITS MISSION TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS CAL JAM IS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THIS TRANSFORMATION HOWEVER THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. AND THIS PROPOSAL CREATES MORE CAPACITY FOR CAL JIM TO CONTINUE ON THIS PATH. SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL WILL INCREASE STAFF PRESENCE ON THE FIELD TO PERFORM INSPECTIONS AND CONTINUE THE QUEST TO WITNESS ALL OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS. ESPECIALLY THOSE TAKING PLACE AT CRITICAL WELL SITES NEAR SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. THIS INCLUDES ALSO COLLECTING INFORMATION AND J. S. STAND UP FOR RELATED FACILITIES AND PIPELINES. THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW CALCIUM TO CONTINUE ENHANCING IMPLEMENTATION OF SB FIVE FIFTY ONE AND AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT BONDING IS IN PLACE OF THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE TO ASSUME LIABILITY. FOR ORPHANED OR ABANDONED WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES. IT WILL ALSO HELP ENSURE IDYLLWILD MANAGEMENT PLANS AND FEES ARE SUBMITTED IN A TIMELY AND ACCURATE MANNER. IT WILL STRENGTHEN CAL GEMS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF ENFORCEMENT ORDERS FROM THE SUPERVISOR. STAFF CAPACITY CREATED BY THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALSO HELP CAL JIM FURTHER DEVELOP PRIORITIES TO PLUG AND ABANDON WELL SCIENCE AND ATTENDED FACILITIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE NEAR SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. THERE ARE ALSO BE CAPACITY TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY THROUGH INCREASED DATA INTEGRITYAND SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RULE MAKING CURRENT CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AS WELL AS FUTURE RULE RULE MAKING. FINALLY THE PROPOSAL HELPS CAL JAM IMPLEMENT COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO DECARBONIZE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS IS A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION THAT CONSISTS OF TWELVE NEW POSITIONS IN YEAR ONE TEN POSITIONS IN YEAR TWO AND FOUR POSITIONS IN THE FINAL YEAR HERE THREE. WE DECIDED TO TAKE A MORE MEASURED APPROACH WITH THIS PROPOSAL DUE TO THE CONTINUING ECONOMIC STRUGGLES RESULTING FROM THE KOVIN PANDEMIC. NONETHELESS THESE ARE CRITICAL POSITIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION F CAL JAM AND ITS ABILITY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE STRONGEST REGULATIONS ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ENACTED NATIONALLY. I'M GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU BEFORE WE GET TO THE L. A. L. STAFF REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THAT WE'VE GOT THE SHELL WELLS IN THE MAY WELLS. SHELL CHAU YEAH WHICH SHALL WITH. ARE MAY WITH. A CAN YOU. GIVE US SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT IT'S A JENNIFER THERE'S- CERTAIN PROCEDURES THAT USE YOU. WITNESS AND BE THERE IN MAKE IT POPULAR CENTER K. A WELL OR STUFF LIKE THAT THE LIKE FIFTY THREE WELL THAT YOU MAY WITNESS HOW DO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL STEP. HOW IS THAT GOING TO. HARM OF BE. WORKED UP A I ASSUME THAT THE- LIKES THAT K. JIM SO THERE WATCHING MY HAPPENING TO EVERY COOPER. RIGHT I MEAN THEY DON'T WANNA PAY FOR IT BUT WOULD LIKE HAVE SOMEBODY THERE- TELL ME DID THIS THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO FROM A WORK. OUR LAYOUT BUT PERSPECTIVE. SO IT DOES INCREASE OUR OUR FIELD PRESENCE- AND YOU KNOW IT MADE IT LEAN- THE WITNESS SCENE- WE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO ALL WITNESSING ALL THE TIME- UNFORTUNATELY AND SO IN THOSE CASES- IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO WITNESS- IT THEN IT'S BASICALLY- THEY ARE THE WITNESS SCENE IS WAIVED OR- THAT THE PROPOSAL- THAT THE STEP IN THE PROCESS THAT THEN THE- OPERATORS UNDER IS MOVED ON- IN SO THIS GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO DO- MUCH MORE WITNESSING THEN THEN WE'RE ABLE TO DO TODAY. AND PRESUMABLY THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO IN THERE AT THIS PLACE WHERE THEY NEED TO HAVE IT WITNESSED AND- OBSERVE THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE STAFF HERE SO THAT THAT COULD BE APPROVED AND THEN THEY CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT A NEXT BUSINESS. BECAUSE IF THE IF YOU CAN'T GET. BECAUSE OF OUR STAFFING PER STAGE HAVE TO WAIT IF IT'S A SHELL WITNESS THEY JUST HAVE TO WAIT RIGHT CAN YOU CAN WAIVE THAT WITNESS- I WILL ASK- MY- ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY CLAYTON HASS TO CLARIFY THAT I- I WHAT I WANT I WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE. WE CAN- WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WITNESS AND IF WE MOVE BEYOND THAT PERIOD OF TIME- WHERE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HAVE FIELD PRESENCE AND THEN THE- THE WITNESSING REQUIREMENT IS WAIVED. S. DEPUTY ARE INSURED THIS IS CLAYTON AWESOME ACTING CHIEF DEPUTY- YEAH IT WHAT DIRECTOR SHOULD MAYES INSTEAD IS CORRECT. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO OUT AND WITNESSES SHALL WITNESSES BUT WE CAN ALSO WAIVE THE SHOT WITNESSES. AND A LOT OF THOSE CHOICES ARE DISCRETIONARY IF IT'S AN OPERATOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF COMPLIANCE ISSUES. AND WE HAVE A MORE CRITICAL WELL THAT IS A MAY WITH MAY WITNESS TEST- WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION ON WHAT WELL IS MORE CRITICAL TO ACTUALLY WITNESS. SO IF WE DO WAIVE A TEST WE MAKE THAT DISCRETIONARY DECISION ON WE FEEL THAT IT'S BETTER TO WAVE. A SHALL THAN A MATE IN SOME CASES WE TRIED TO GET OUT TO ALL OF THEM WE JUST DO NOT HAVE THE STAFFING AVAILABLE TO GET TO EVERY SINGLE. SHALL WITNESS TESTS AND IN SOME CASES THE MAY WITNESSES ARE MORE CRITICAL IN OUR OPINION TO GO OUT AND WITNESS THEN THE SHELVES BECAUSE IT DID. ASSEMBLY THEN THE TOTALITY OF THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE COMMUNITY AND WHAT AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING. BEING DONE. INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF- PEOPLE THAT HAVE- OPINIONS ABOUT CALCIUM FEATHER AND WHETHER THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING IT IS INTERESTING THAT BY SPENDING MORE MONEY. YOU GET TO DO THE WORK THAT THAT. PEOPLE EXPECT TO BE DONE BUT NOT HAVING IT THAT DISCRETIONARY. PROVISION ALLOWS THAT NOBODY'S WATCHING THIS. THE C. MEMBERS. AS HE SAID STERN- CENTER DOLLAR. THE QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO OFF I NEED TO JUST- YOU KNOW WE HAVE AYE IS T. WHICH IS ACTUALLY TO- ISSUE TWENTY. SO OFF WE KNOW LAST YEAR WE GAVE YOU- THAT THE TO HIRE I BELIEVE WAS TO SEVEN POSITION CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CURRENT- ALLOCATION FROM LAST YEAR. IT WHICH WAS UNDER ISSUE TEN AND HOW MANY FOLKS YOU GOT HIRED UP AND COMING ON THE JOB. SO TODAY WE'VE HIRED THREE AND WE HAVE- ANNOUNCED AND THEN CLOSED ALL THE POSITIONS- FROM LAST YEAR'S B. C. P. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. REVIEWING THOSE APPLICATIONS AND STARTING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS FOR THE REMAINING POSITIONS. SO OUT OF TWENTY FIVE POSITION YOU HAVE THREE FILLED. AT THREE TODAY YES AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ITEM TWENTY SEVEN. FOR AN ADDITIONAL. TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT IS. SO WHY IS YOUR RESEARCH ISN'T HOW WHAT THE PROBLEM HOW CAN YOU GET THESE FOLKS HIGHER I MEAN WE'RE CAN TO MY IT'S IN MY IT'S A- YOU KNOW IT'S A FEEL GOOD OF. THAT WERE KEEPING OUR- RESOURCES BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. WELL LAST YEAR- WEEK WE GET RIGHT INTO THE HEAD WINDS OF PROGRAMS AND I'M HAVING TO WORK FROM HOME AND- IN THAT REMOTE ENVIRONMENT- WEEK WE GET BECAUSE- WITH WITH THE FACT THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO GO BACK INTO THE OFFICE- THAT WE WOULD START THE PROCESS AND- WHEN WE WHEN WE REALIZED IN THE SUMMER THAT- GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE WASN'T GOING TO BE A REALITY ANYTIME SOON WE GET STARTED PROCESS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD IS THAT MANY OF THESE POSITIONS REQUIRE TRAINING AND SO. ON THE REST OF THE BRAINY- VIRTUALLY BECOMES- A LOT MORE DIFFICULT NONETHELESS WE KNEW WE HAD TO GET THE PROCESS STARTED SO WE GET START. I'M WRITING THOSE POSITIONS AND POSTING THEM TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR. SO- YOU WERE SO TO REAP. BACK AND- OF YOUR PER- WE'RE THAT REPORT OUT. IT'S STILL PENDING. SO IS IT SAFE TO SAY THEN THAT. WE ONLY REALLY HAVE THREE PEOPLE THERE AND I UNDERSTAND CO BUT I KNOW THAT TO I DO A LITTLE HOMEWORK TO THIRTEEN OF THE FULL TIME STAFF ARE CURRENTLY DIVERTED DOING COVERT CONTRACT TRACING. AND THEN THERE'S 80% OF YOUR OF YOUR FULL STAFF WHICH IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED VACANCY SO THERE SEEMS TO BE. SOME ISSUE HERE. AND- YOU KNOW GETTING THE FOLKS TO DO GETTING THE FOR THE EMPLOYEES OUT THERE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'VE- THAT THE BOOK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS YOU KNOW BUT- FUNDED. BY ORDERED ACTUALLY THE OIL PRODUCERS ARE FUNDED SO. I FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES WE HAVE AN EVEN. NUMBER ONE GOT THE REPORT BACK NUMBER TWO WE HAVEN'T HAD THE VACANCIES FROM LAST YEAR SO- IS IT MAKES SENSE TO ME WHY WE WOULD CONTINUE TO JUST POUR MONEY INTO A PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THE FOLKS UP AND RUNNING ON THE ON THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK IT'S JUST NOT PRUDENT WE SHOULD WAIT. AND GET THE POSITIONS THAT WE- THAT WE BONDED LAST YEAR BILL BEFORE WE GO ADDING. MORE BURDEN. UPON THE- THE PRODUCERS TO YOU KNOW PAY FOR THESE. ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT AREN'T EVEN THERE. I'M WE HAVE THE L. A. L. ROW MAYBE YOU COULD RIM OVER I KNOW THAT- SENATOR JACK'S HAS A REQUIREMENT ON OF PLUGGING AND ABANDONING WELLS WITH MISS LIMóN WHO'S NOW IN THE SENATE CENTER STERN HAS A CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATION OF- A NATURAL GAS STORAGE THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE MORE OVERSIGHT REGULATIONS TOP PLEASE PROCEED. FREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YES UNITS ROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND WE FIND THAT THE RESOURCES REQUESTED AN ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE EXISTING BACKLOG OF FIELD INSPECTIONS GAP BETWEEN ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN CAPACITY. AS WELL AS THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION AND DATA REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC. AND IN ADDITION ASKED THE CHAIR MENTIONED READ RECENT REGISTRATION HAS INCREASED A LOT OF OVERSIGHT IS REQUIREMENTS. WHICH HAS INCREASED THE DIVISION'S WORKLOADS. HOWEVER CALLAGY I AND YOU FEEL AND OVERSIGHT WORKLOAD IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AND CAN CHANGE OVER TIME FOR A MULTIPLE NUMBER OF REASONS AND- FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DIVISION'S WORKLOADS COULD INCLUDE- MARKET CHANGES TO GEOGRAFIA PRODUCTION AND COMPLEXITY OF. REVIEWS AND ALSO JUST THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING AND YOU PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE RECENT LEGISLATION. THAT WE RECOMMEND- THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A BUDGET REQUEST TO MEET INCREASED WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED- WITH THESE CHANGES- HOWEVER WE FIND AND WE FIND THAT THE RESURCES ARE JUSTIFIED ON THE WORKLOAD BASIS AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- HAVE RESIDENTS THAT AMOUNT IN THE FIELD AND OVERSIGHT WORKLOAD COULD VERY DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS- AND- AT. AS UP AS- SENATE ALI MENTIONED YOU KNOW AND- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF AND YOU POSITION- AND THAT THAT DIVISION HAS RECEIVED IN RECENT. YEARS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE DIVISION'S PERFORMANCE IN SEVERAL AREAS OF OPERATIONS. BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AFTER AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE. SOME MORE ACCOUNTABILITY ON- HOW. THE DIVISION IS PERFORMING AND- YEAH. ALL EGGNOG CENTER STERN IS WITH US MORNING SAID STERN CENTER TO FACT YOU SO YOU JUST PROVED TO OF THE PROBLEM WE DID REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT BACK AND YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD ADD ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO REPORT BACK AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH GOVERNMENT IS THAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK WE JUST KEEP ADDING MORE MONEY TO IT EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T. GET THE PERFORMANCE. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE LEGISLATURE. HAS FUNDED HAS FORCED THE FUNDING ON THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT GIVING US THE RESULT WE'RE ASKING FOR. DON'T WE GONNA DO. WE'RE GONNA. ADD ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS TO THE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS WE PUT UP LAST YEAR WE ONLY HAVE THREE POSITIONS FILLED. NOBODY WOULD LAST AND PRIVATE BUSINESS DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE- THE PUBLIC DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. JUST BECAUSE WE HAD MONEY TO IT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROBLEMS GETTING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR GETTING FULFILL. SO I THINK WE NEED A TOTAL OVERHAUL OF THIS PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE PHYSICIANS FILLED. THAT WE ALREADY ALLOCATED THE FUNDS FOR. BEFORE WE GO ALLOCATING MORE FUNDS FOR MILLION DOLLARS BY THE WAY. AND ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS IT'S INSANE. MAKES NO SENSE. WELL THAT WAS OUR LEGISLATIVE VALLI'S LET'S GO TO FINANCE MISS MCGUIRE YOU'RE ON THE LINE YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP- YES. IT LIKE. MORNING LEVINE AGUIAR-CURRY BERMAN I FINANCE- JUST. VACANCY IS- AS AS SURE SHE BE USING IT CORRECT IT AFFECTS- APARTMENTS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER AND BOARD THOSE. BUT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT- YOU KNOW THAT FIVE POSITION GRANT LAST YEAR SIX WERE. FOR ALLEGE MANDATE- THE ARE VERY YOU KNOW THE SKILLS IN THOSE ARE ON OR CATCH. THEY REQUIRE A STAFF OF THE. WELL THIS IS A NEW KIND OF SKILL SET- AND SO IT'S TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN USUAL I AM TIRED OF THOSE DECISIONS. THE DECISION TO CLOSE THEIR- THEY ARE ACTIVELY INTERVIEWING- APPLICANTS THEY HAD A AN INCREDIBLY- WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS- FOR THESE POSITIONS. SO I WOULD JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT AS YOU AS YOU CONSIDER AT ALL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR- THAT IN THAT SIXTEEN POSITIONS THAT YOU'VE ARTICULATED THIRD NECESSARY SOME OF THEM ARE REQUIRED UNDER SB FOUR SIX THREE BY SENATOR STERN CENTER STERN. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YEAH I HAD MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY JUST ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE VARIOUS REPORTS HE REQUIRED HIS BUILDING ON. CENTER DOLLARS LINE OF QUESTIONING THERE BUT- SPECIFICALLY- YEAH YOU MENTIONED THIS BEFORE SIXTY THREE REPORT BUT I'M ALSO I WANTED LIKE TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THE REPORT ON THE ISLAND ABANDONED WELL STUDY REQUIRED BY HOLDING LEGISLATION- THE WELL STIMULATION STUDY REQUIRED INTEREST BEFORE. WHICH BY THE WAY AS BEFORE IS THAT FRACKING BILL WE PASSED. NOT LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE THAT BUT ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS STILL STAFF IN THIS BUILDING- OVER FIVE YEARS AGO- SO. WAITING ON SOME WELL STEM REPORTING AND THEN LASTLY THE STATUS OF THE U. ICY REPORT THE UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL PROGRAM. WHICH WE'VE BEEN AUDITED ON FOUND IN NON COMPLIANCE SEVEN STILL HAVE YET TO IDENTIFY- FULLY ALL OF ARE EXEMPTED AQUIFER'S SO- IT'S ABOUT STAT ON THOSE. THREE CORE REPORTS CHARACTER SHOULD PLEASE ANYONE TAKE A CRACK ON THE REPORT CARD. YOUR YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND YES WE- WE HAVE THOSE REPORTS IN PROCESS- AND WE HOPE TO HAVE THEM TO YOU VERY SHORTLY- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WERE BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT- THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE FINISH LINE IN AND WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS AND. OKAY SO- I'LL TAKE THAT SOON- I GUESS MEETING BEFORE THIS BUDGET CONVERSATION IS UP I MEAN I'M- IT IS THIS IS THIS ADDITIONAL STAFFING SHOULD I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO MANAGE OUR EXPECTATIONS YOU'RE LIKE IS THIS ADDITIONAL STAFFING ACTUALLY GONNA HELP. SURVIVE SOME OF THE RECTIFY SOME OF THE- GAPS IN BOTH REPORTING THE LEGISLATURE AND PUBLIC REPORTING- I THINK OF THE- YOU KNOW THE STATUS OF THE WELL FINDER- RIGHT NOW IN SOME OF THE- HITCHES IN GETTING. ACCURATE INFORMATION EVEN ON LOCATION OF SOME OF THE SITES OUT TO THE PUBLIC BUT THANK YOU CAN YOU SET OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT YOU EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THIS NEW TRUNCHEONS. OF FINDING IS THIS REALLY ABOUT BUYING TIME SHE CAN KEE RECRUITING- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I HEARD THE OSA THIS IS A NEW LINE OF WORK SO IT TAKES MORE PATIENCE PLUGGING AND ABANDONING WELLS IS NOT A NEW LINE OF WORK TO MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S BEEN. THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF WELLS PLUGGED AND ABANDONED OVER THE YEARS SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S- WHAT'S SO NEW HERE AND IT JUST. YEAH WHAT WHAT TO EXPECT THAT IS THE MONEY- INDEED IT'LL GIVE US YOU KNOW NEW CAPACITY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TODAY AND THE- AND THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW WORK FASTER- BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO SPREAD THAT WORKLOAD OVER MORE PEOPLE- SO OUR ANTICIPATION IS THAT IN FACT WE WILL BE. GETTING YOU KNOW WORKED ON. IN A IN A FASTER. MANNER IT'S HARD TO KNOW- YOU KNOW PROSPECTIVELY YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS ALL GOING TO MANIFEST BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE EXPECTATION AND ANTICIPATION. OKAY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE A YES HI MISTER WIRE YOUR RECOGNIZE. LET'S NOT. LET GO YES NO IT SAYS I THINK YOU HAVE ANOTHER DEVICE THAT SAUNDERS SAID AND SOMEBODY ON THE PANEL HAVE A SECOND DEVICE ON BECAUSE IT'S YOUR GARBLED MIS MCGUIRE. OKAY SO I DIDN'T GET THAT PHONE ON KILL THE PHONE. NO. M. IT'S- CONNECTION SO. I. T. SERVICES YOUR CONNECTION. I GUESS WHAT WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO RESOLVE THAT SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE THROUGHPUT HOW QUICKLY DO YOU EXPECT TO FILL ALL THE OUTSTANDING POSITIONS THAT ARE OPEN AS WELL AS THE NEW POSITIONS ANTICIPATED WHAT IT WHAT'S YOUR WHAT'S YOUR INTERNAL TIME FRAME FOR THAT MR SPAS IN. SO THAT TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS FROM LAST YEAR- THEY HAVE ALL CLOSED AND WE ARE REVIEWING APPLICATIONS AND GETTING READY FOR THE INTERVIEW- PHASE- FILLING THOSE POSITIONS- SO. I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT- THREE MONTHS OR SO- TO GET A MALL TO GET HIM FILLED- AND THEN IF FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW WE DON'T FIND- YOU KNOW FOR ANY OF THE POSITIONS- YOU KNOW SOMEONE QUALITY ARE TRULY QUALIFIED TO FILL THE POSITION IF WE WILL HAVE TO REPOST THAT BUT RIGHT NOW OUR TO. OUR EXPECTATION IS TO IS TO MOVE ALONG IN THE PROCESS AND BE DONE IN. ABOUT ROUGHLY THE NEXT I WOULD SAY THREE MONTHS OR SO. OKAY THREE MONTHS OR SO. MISTER GORE YOU BECKER. IS MISS ONE FROM A FINANCE. THIS REGARDLESS TRIED AGAIN. NO NOW I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T TELL. IT'S NOT MUCH BETTER. LET'S SEE TO SEE IF YOU CAN PUNCH THROUGH TALK FOR A BIT AND IF I STOP YEAH STOP YEAH. IT'S EASY. TO JUST JUST. IT WAS IS NOT START MOVING TOWARD THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK- WE'RE GONNA DO WE CAN CORRESPOND WE CAN DO A FOLLOW UP HERE- AND DIGGING A LITTLE DEEPER ON THIS FRONT I JUST I KNOW IT'S IS A HUGE ISSUE- NOT JUST IN MY BACKYARD IN LOS ANGELES WITH ALL THE URBAN OIL SITES BUT- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND- THE TRUST HAS BEEN BROKEN OVER THE YEARS AND WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO REFORM CAL JAM THERE. TURN IT BACK INTO SOMETHING THAT HAS THAT KIND OF SHINE TO IT- AND I KNOW WE BROUGHT YOU IN MR SHOULD BOSNIAN TO BE OVER A REFORMER IN TO PUSH THROUGH AND THERE'S A LOT OF CULTURE AND MISSION OVER ALL THIS ARE YOU ACURRENT AND THAT'S NOT EASY WORK NECESSARILY BUT- WHAT WE HAVE TO BE DEMANDING OF YOU AND YOU KNOW THE GAS RIGHT NOW OR ARE SENDING US ALL BACK AND FRANKLY MAKING IT LOOK MORE. LIKE THE OLD DOG THE DOG OR A BOLD SO I'M JUST I WOULD ADD YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PUMPING THE BRAKES TO GET ON FUNDING AND I'M FRANKLY FRUSTRATED THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TALKING NOW ABOUT AN AUGMENTATION WHEN LAST YEAR WE ABANDON THAT AUGMENTATION WE COULD HAVE BEEN DOING THAT. ON THE FRONT END AND THE FACT IT INDUSTRY ALSO OPPOSE THAT AUGMENTATION BUT NOW IS PROBABLY WISHING THEY HAD IT SO THAT PERMITS COULD BE PROCESS THAT THINGS COULD BE INVESTIGATED BECAUSE IT ALL SLOWS DOWN SO I THINK IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S INTEREST NOT JUST THE FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES TO GET A FUNCTIONAL CAL GEM I DO SEE WORKING HERE BUT I GOTTA JUST SAY IT'S- IT FEELS LIKE. THERE'S A DISCONNECT WITH WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS TO SEE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW GAPS ON WELL MAPS AND YOU START TO GET SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S GOING ON DOWN THE STREET AND YOU DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT IT IS AN ABANDONED WELL THAT JUST HASN'T MADE THE CUT LIKE HOW DOES THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR IN A CITY OR A COUNTY DEAL WITH. THAT KIND OF INFORMATION A LOT OF IS STILL ON PAPER AND IT'S NOT EVEN DIGITIZE THIS POINT IT'S A HEADACHE ON ADA COMPLIANCE. EVEN FOR PUBLISHING SOME OF THE STUFF ON THE INTERNET WE KNOW- THEY HAD A BUT I JUST I WANT TO SEE THAT MAY. ENERGY FOCUS EXIT- THE PUBLIC'S GONNA DEMAND YOURSELF THANKS FOR LETTING ME GIVE ME A MINUTE ON THE SOAP THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS WE KNOW THAT THE KOBE LAST. MAY OR JUNE WE'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS ON WHAT TO FUND WHAT THE NOT FOUND THERE WAS A LOT OF THE THANKS ABOUT. THE ECONOMY CRASHING AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY WAS THERE BUT MISSED I'M NOT GOING TO. REPRESENT THE ADMINISTRATION MASTERS I DIRECTED US TO PAUSE AND DO YOU HAVE. ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD FOR THE COMMITTEE. BUT NOT THIS MORNING OTHER THAN- I MIGHT MIGHT- ADMIN DIRECTOR HAS ADVISED ME THAT- THE THREE MONTH MARK THAT I HAD HAD LAID OUT HIS IS OPTIMISTIC THAT'S IF EVERYTHING GOES. PERFECTLY WELL AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW TO GIVE OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT MORE I HAVE A WINDOW OPEN FOR YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- YOU KNOW MAY ARISE WHERE YEAH WE DO HAVE TO STRETCH OUT THE HIRING PROCESS- BUT OTHER THAN THAT NO NOT THIS MORNING. OKAY I'M OBVIOUSLY. I HAVE MORE THAN PASSING INTEREST AND THIS IS A TOPIC SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THANKS EVERYBODY FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND WE WILL HOLD THIS MATTER I CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT AND IRAQ TO BRING FORWARD THE FISH AND WILDLIFE- DEPARTMENT AND I HAVE A PRESENTATION I THINK THEY'RE VERY STRICT BOTTOM GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO THE SUB TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND YOU HAVE A WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT OUR FAVORITE SINCE I'VE BEEN THE CHAIR HERE THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING SO- YES. IF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. HERE BEAR WITH ME A SECOND I'M GONNA SHARE SCREEN. AND THIS WILL BE THE HARDEST. TASKS FOR ME TODAY. ALL RIGHT WE GOT SCREEN. PERFECT SO IT'S TRUE MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IT'S GREAT TO SEE EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I WISH IT WEREN'T PERSON HELP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE SAFE AND WELL. I'M NOT GONNA READ. THIS SLIDE. STYLE NO NO IN PRESENTATIONS YOU CAN READ IT. AND THAT TAKES US TO. THE NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU SEE THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION STATEMENT HERE AND IN MY JUDGMENT IF YOU PULL DOWN THAT MISSION STATEMENT IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE SIMPLE WORD NATURE. IT IS NATURE FROM BEES THE BUTTERFLIES WHALES TO MOUNT LIONS. OUR MISSION IS ABOUT PRESERVING LAND WATER WILDLIFE THAT'S A REASON WHY WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST THRIVING ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD THAT NATURAL WEALTH. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NATURAL WEALTH WE HAVE. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY BIRD SPECIES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MAMMAL SPECIES SEVENTY FIVE IN THE BN'S. ALMOST A HUNDRED FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES UNDER MARINE FISH SPECIES OF MAMMALS IN SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TAXA OF PLANTS. TWO THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET. THIS NATURE'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE IT'S WHY THEY STAY. AND IT'S WHO ARE DEPARTMENTS SO WE'VE BEEN ON A LONG JOURNEY SURE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE JOURNEY ACTUALLY PREDATES ALL OF US IT STARTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES. AND THE CRUX OF THIS JOURNEY HAS BEEN TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE TO SUSTAINABLY FUNDED DEPARTMENT WHOSE JOB IS THIS MISSION STATEMENT. MOST RECENT PART OF THIS JOURNEY IS BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN THE BUDGET ACT. WHEN YOU THE LEGISLATURE INSTRUCTED OUR DEPARTMENT TO COMPLETE SOMETHING CALLED SERVICE BASED BUDGET. THAT'S S. B. B. WE HARD TO AVOID A NATIONAL FIRM THAT HAS EXPERTISE IN THIS SPACE. AND YOU CAN SEE THE GOALS OF THE SERVICE BAYS BUDGET PROCESS DESCRIBED HERE. THE BOTTOM PART OF THE SLOT. WE'RE DONE WITH THAT AFTER. WE FILED OUR FINAL REPORT WITH YOU ONE TIME ACTUALLY WE RETRACT THAT ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER. BUT YOU'RE IN RECEIPT OF THAT FINAL REPORT. HERE'S HOW WE STARTED THIS DYNAMIC ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. WE CONVENE AN EXTERNAL DIVISORS COMMITTEE. OUR DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY WHICH ALSO INCLUDED ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUR BUDGET AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE STARTED WITH TRYING TO RETHINK WHAT WE DO AND DESCRIBING IT USING PLAIN LANGUAGE AND WE BROKE OUR CORE SERVICES INTO THE SIMPLER NARRATIVES. ARE WORKING WITH EXTERNAL COMMITTEE I DESCRIBE HERE ON THE SLIDE YOU SEE WE WANTED TO FIND WORDS THAT WE THOUGHT THE PUBLIC WOULD UNDERSTAND MORE EASILY. WORDS IT WOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE DIVIDE OUR WORK APPROACH AT THE DEPARTMENT. FROM THERE. THE RESULTS ARE REAL THEY'RE CONSEQUENTIAL AND I WOULD SAY INTERNALLY FOR US AT THE DEPARTMENT THEY'RE KIND OF BARRIER SHATTERING. WE'RE REALLY OLD INSTITUTION WE'RE ACTUALLY CELEBRATING WITH OUR SISTER COMMISSION ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. AND WE HAVE A FOOT IN OUR PAST BUT WE ALSO HAVE A FOOT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OF OUR FUTURE. WE CAN JEANS. ALMOST A HUNDRED OF OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT. WE CREATED IT ADVISORY GROUP WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT FROM OUR LOWEST NEWEST RANK AND FILE STAFF ALL THE WAY UP TO MEET THE DIRECTOR. AND WE TOOK A LOOK AT EVERYTHING WE DID WE TOOK THOSE EIGHT CERVECERIAS AND WE IDENTIFIED OVER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TASKS WE DO. SO WE'RE NOT THIS MAMMOTH EXCEL SPREADSHEET. THAT BREAKS DOWN EACH PERSON'S LABOR OUR RELATIVE TO THE TASKS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE SERVICE AREAS. WE ALSO DID A REVENUE WHILE ANNOUNCES OF OUR TOP TEN ARGUABLY MOST IMPORTANT OR COMPLICATED FUNDS SOURCES WHICH WAS PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT YOU GAVE. WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU DO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS A DATA DRIVEN. PORTRAYAL OF YOUR CURRENT LEVEL WORK WHICH YOU SEE IN THE SLIDE HERE THE DARKER BLUE. WITHIN A PROGRAM AREA AND THEN THE GAP BENCHMARKED AGAINST THE MISSION LEVEL WHICH HAS A DEFINITION YOU KIND OF LOOK AT ALL OF YOUR STATUTORY ASSIGNMENT YOUR POLICIES YOUR BEST SCIENCE COMMITMENT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU WERE DOING ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO HIT THE MISSION AND YOU UNDERSTAND DATA DRIVEN GAP WITH CURRENT EMISSION. NOW IMPORTANTLY THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN FILL THE GAP IT'S JUST NOT HIRING MORE PEOPLE YOU CAN INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM YOU COULD PARTNER BETTER WITH YOUR EXTERNAL COMMUNITY TO REDUCE COST FIND SAVINGS YOU COULD IMPROVE YOUR OWN PROCESS SEES YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR MISSIONS AND MANDATES AND YOU COULD ASK THE QUESTION SOMETHING GIVEN TO US AS A TASK IN NINETEEN THIRTY. IS IT STILL RELEVANT OR SHOULD COME OFF THE BOOKS. IN HERE'S WHAT YOU GET. WHEN YOU RUN THIS DATA ANALYTICS USING AN OUTSIDE FIRM LIKE THE LLOYD. WORKING WITH YOUR BUDGET STAFF AND OUR EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. ON THE BOTTOM HERE YOU SEE ALL OF THOSE EIGHT CORE PROGRAM AREAS. IN TO BE HONEST THIS IS NOT NEW NEW. SINCE THE FIFTIES PEOPLE ASK WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO SUSTAINABLY FIND THIS DEPARTMENT. YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE OF ACTUALLY AMENDED THE FISH AND GAME CODE TO EXPRESSLY SAY THE DEPARTMENT'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES WERE UNDERFUNDED IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE. WHAT IS NEW IS THAT DATA BASED ANALYTICS TO REACH THESE CONCLUSIONS SO I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WARRANTS ON YOUR SIDE BUT ON MY COMPUTER COMPUTER ON THE LEFT YOU'LL SEE THE AREAS WHERE OUR GAP IS SMALLEST. OUR CURRENT LEVEL IS THE HIGHEST GOING ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT ARE TO LOWEST PERFORMING AREAS ARE PERMITTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OUR SPECIES INHABIT. YOU CAN RUN THE DATA ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENT VISUAL DEPICTION USING LABOR HOURS. TO EXPRESS THE SAME KIND OF RESULTS WHAT YOUR CURRENT. IN YOUR MISSIONS. HERE ARE THE KEY FINDINGS WHICH ARE JUST WORDS THAT REFLECT THE LAST TWO SLIDE YOU SAW. AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION. ROSS THE BOARD KIND OF ON AVERAGE WE'RE FUNDED ABOUT WE NEED ABOUT THREE TIMES MORE INVESTMENT IN CAPACITY TO HIT THE MISSION LEVEL ASSIGNMENTS. ACTUALLY SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES OUR DEPARTMENTS HAD ADDED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED STATUTORY MANDATES AND OBLIGATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WHICH IS PART IN PARCEL KIND OF THAT DYNAMIC THAT'S PRODUCING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT. OUR LAST TWO SLIDES THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A ONE OFF FOR US SO THIS SLIDE JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE WITHIN OUR INSTITUTION. EVERY YEAR WE WILL UPDATE THIS INFORMATION. EVERY FIVE YEARS WE WILL UPDATE THE INFORMATION THAT ESTABLISHES YOUR MISSION LEVEL SERVICE AREN'T BASS LINES WE HAVE TRAINED ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS SO WE'VE INSTITUTIONALIZED THIS. WE HAVE THESE DIGITAL TOOLS NOW AVAILABLE WHERE WE CAN RUN INFORMATION REQUEST USING ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS YOU SEE KIND OF DISPLAYED HERE AND BE RESPONSIVE TO YOUR REQUEST WE'VE CHANGED OUR DEPARTMENTS ORIENTATION SUCH THAT THESE ARE THE TOOLS NOW INFORMING EACH OF OUR BUDGET CYCLE PROPOSALS- ENGAGEMENTS WITH FINANCE. AND ACTUALLY HARDY FULL TIME PERSON TO MANAGE THIS DATA SAID AND IT IS OUR NEW WAY OF BUSINESS SO AT A MINIMUM WHAT'S YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS DONE IS PRODUCE THE DATA SAID. THAT NOW GIVES US THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PROBLEM. AND CREATED A CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS REALLY PULLED HERSELF INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THINKING ABOUT A PRETTY WICKED HEART PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN AROUND LONG BEFORE. WE WERE ALL HERE. SO LET ME STOP THERE THAT'S THE REPORT ON SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND IN A MOMENT WE HAVE A SEGUE TO A- SEPARATE AGENDA ITEM WHICH IS ABOUT A BUDGET CHANGE HOLES ALL SEEKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INFORMATION I DISCUSS THE PRESENT. I THANK YOU DIRECTOR I SEE. FINANCE MISS ONE HAS YOUR HAND UP THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TO RECOGNIZE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANTED TO JUST- JUST BRIEFLY- CIRCLE BACK TO THAT CALDERON- OVERSIGHT PROPOSAL I'M INTERESTED- REITERATES ESSENTIALLY THAT- YOU KNOW WE TOOK A MEASURED APPROACH- YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD- FILLING THE POSITIONS- AND SO REALLY JUST WANTED TO- TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE APPOINTMENTS AND SO THAT THAT IS- IN LARGE PART WHY WE PROPOSED A- THREE. A THREE YEAR FACING POSITIONS THANK YOU RELEVANT WRITTEN RECORD WILL REFLECT ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO MISS TAYLOR'S- WHAT THE CALLIOPE ON THE ON THE A SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. IT REALLY SHOWS LL OUR WOUNDS. OF HOW WONDERFUL AND WHO CLEAR OUT WE ARE. IN THE GROUP IN THAT HAVE A TRUE WAY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AGAIN RETAILER FROM pFIRST JUST A KNOWLEDGE IN ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE ON THIS THEY SHOULD REALLY BE COMMENDED FOR HOW THEY EMBRACE THIS I THINK IT'S WORTH. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE TOLD THEM TO DO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAME FORTH AND ASKED TO DO BUT THEY REALLY DID EMBRACE IT- AND REALLY RAN WITH IT AND PROVIDE A LOT OF REALLY AND INFORMATION THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE. BUT INFORMATION IS ONLY USEFUL AS LONG AS IT IS USED SO I THINK THE NEXT STEP IS REALLY. WHAT WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION AND OF COURSE PART OF THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE HOW TO RESPOND- BUT CERTAINLY ALSO THE IN MINISTRATION AND SO I THINK THE NEXT PHASE IS REALLY GOING TO BE WHAT IT WILL HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS. AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THOSE AREAS WILL RECEIVE THE LARGEST GAPS IN THE SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND- AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AREAS. SO WHAT TIME IT IS A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IN THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET. AND THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME GIVEN THEIR REVENUES AND UNCERTAINTY TO TRY AND ADDRESS SOME LONGSTANDING SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS LIKE THIS BUT I DO THINK- ENGAGING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND REALLY TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT IS THE PLAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESSES ON AN ON GOING BASIS IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE INFORMATION IS GREAT TO HAVE IT HIGHLIGHTED BUT BUT WHAT COMES NEXT IN. AB WE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENGAGE DEEPLY AND REALLY PRESS THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL TO TRY AND GET SOME LONG TERM PLANNING THEM. TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THESE. ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GAPS. I THERE'S LEGISLATIVE PLAN AFOOT TO GIVE WHO. THE SERVICE IN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SEVEN MILLION FURTHER. EXTREME AND VERY HIGH FIRE- ARE THREATS OF FIRE AREAS BUT THAT'LL WE'LL SAVE THAT FOR LATER ON IN THE AGENDA SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN A MISTER VICE CHAIR- THANK YOU TO OTHER DIRECTOR I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS AND SOME QUESTIONS FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANNA. I ALWAYS TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR FOR HIS WORK ON ALL ISSUES- FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A- SIX YEARS NOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITH SALMON AND CRAB. AND HE HAS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT ON THIS AND I JUST I CAN'T THINK OF ENOUGH FOR HIS DIRECTING GAUGE MEANS ALWAYS- AND THERE'S MORE CHALLENGES AHEAD. YES SAILORS ALSO SAID I APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT MOVING FORWARD- ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS BEING AT SERVICE FACE BUDGETING. HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE ENTIRE SIX YEARS HAVE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. DETERMINING THE FUNDING PRIORITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND ESPECIALLY ON THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SIDE. AND DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE DIRECTOR HAS ADOPTED THIS. WITH THIS BUDGET SUB MOVING THIS FORWARD AS WELL. I THINK THAT IT DOES EXPOSE A REAL ISSUE OF. SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND HOURS BEING SPENT PER YEAR ON SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION. I'M HERE TO THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION HOURS IN THE DEPARTMENT WE NEED TO BE A NEED TO MISSION RIGHT THAT'S A HUGE GAP- AND JUST BEING CANDID IT'S WE'RE BACK HERE EVERY YEAR- WHETHER IT'S STATE PARKS OR ITS FISH AND WILDLIFE. WITH ONE TIME FIXES. IN WHAT I WOULD HOPE RIGHT NOW WE LOOKING AT THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IMPLEMENTATION IS NOW DEVELOPING A LONG TERM PLAN TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT'S FISHING WILDLIFE IS WELL STATE PARKS. TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THIS JUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT EVERY TIME THERE'S A RECESSION HERE AND BE THE FIRST TO BE CUT. AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOOK FOR THE THING WITH THESE RIDICULOUS FEE INCREASE PROPOSALS. THAT WILL NEVER FLY. QUESTION HERE SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TO MISTER DIRECTOR AGAIN I SINCERELY MEANNESS I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP ON ALL ISSUES OF FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE BUT THE DEPARTMENT'S MEETING ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT BUT ONLY AND CONSERVATION NEEDS SO CAN YOU TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT HOW THIS PLAYED OUT. IN YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE FINDINGS. SO LET ME START WITH YOUR YOUR SECOND QUESTION THE FINDINGS. BROADLY DON'T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE IT'S A ISSUE MOST EVERYONE IS A KNOWLEDGE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT DID SURPRISE ME WAS THE SPECIFICITY AROUND HOW BIG THE GAP IS. IN THOSE AREAS- THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND PERMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. AND WHEN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WAR. WHAT I CONCLUDE IT IS. THOSE AREAS ARE ACTUALLY ARGUABLY HARDER AREAS FOR US TO FUND. BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT WORK IS DRIVEN BY FEE AND WE CAN'T FEED OURSELVES OUT OF ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED. WHICH MEANS WHAT'S THE OTHER FUNDS SOURCE AND HISTORICALLY THE CONVERSATION HAS CENTERED IN ON GENERAL FUND. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY CALLS ON THE GENERAL FUND. SO FOR ME WHEN I LOOK AT PERMITTING AND SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION. WE HAVE A VERY HIGH DEMAND FOR THAT WERE. THOSE FOUR HUNDRED NEW KIND OF ASSIGNMENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. BUT THE SUPPLY TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND IS FEE BASED WHICH CAN ONLY REALLY AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE WORK. FOR GENERAL. WE'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT AN ADDITIVE FUNDS SOURCE TO HELP US BRIDGE THAT GAP OF CONVERSELY IF YOU GO OVER TO ADD BEEN SUPPORT. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE SERVICE LEVEL IS HIGHER. IS THE WAY WE HANDLED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. WE KIND OF THIS CHARGE FOR ADMIN CROSS ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENT. SUCH THAT WERE ALWAYS BRINGING HAD MEN UP TO SECURE THE CAUGHT THE SERVICE LEVEL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- THAT'S I THINK WHY YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE OVER ON ONE SIDE AND THEN IN A DIFFERENCE OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE PERMITTING INSPECTIONS. THE RESEARCHER TRYNA TURN THIS BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR IN JUST ONE MOMENT% NOW THE SAME RESEARCHER I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S FEE BASED AND THERE IS NO CONSISTENT FUNDING WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD ONE TIME MONEY FLOWS IN IN TIMES ARE BAD THEY'RE SLASHED AND THEN WE PLAYED MAKE UP. A TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE CUTS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS AFTER THOSE BAD YEARS WHICH IS MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET SUB WHETHER IT'S THE ISSUE OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR STATE PARKS BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL IN THERE IN THAT SAME POSITION. WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON WITHOUT LONGER TERM OF TWENTY PLAN IS IN MISTER CHAIR SHOULD. I WAIT ON MY ITEMS AND TWENTY NINE. YOU'RE MENTAL WITH THAT GET THE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SECURE. IS FOR. I'M YEAH I THINK THE S. B. B. REALLY US BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY ARE BUDGETS REFLECTION OF WHAT OUR VALUES ARE IN WHEN YOU GET THIS DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT MEETING. GETTING CLOSE TO THE MISSION THAT WE WANT I MEAN I GET THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ASPIRATION AND THAT'S THAT'S FINE AND DANDY PUTS BUT PART OF IT IS THAT HE SAID. WHEN WE TALK WITH THESE OTHER COMPETING I HAVE CHALLENGES WHETHER IT'S AN EDUCATION OR SAID TRANSPORTATION OR OR OTHER BUDGET- ALLOCATIONS IT GIVES US SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S TIMES. EXPRESSIVITY SAY LET'S JUST GET THE 30% PLUS THE SCRIPTED 32% OR WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS- VICE CHAIR DOLLY. DIGITAL QUICKER. REALLY TO PRESENTE I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THIS INFORMATION COME FOR IS THEIR ABILITY TO GET A COPY OF YOUR POWER POINT PLEASE- SO I CAN DIVE IN A LITTLE DEEPER ON THAT. YES AND ALSO- THE REPORT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T RECEIVED HARD COPIES WILL MAKE SURE YOUR OFFICES EACH HAVE. A LINKS. WE HAVE A DEDICATED WEBSITE FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION. AND THE REPORTS WE'VE MADE TO THE EXTERNAL COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SO WE'LL MAKE SURE EACH OF YOUR OFFICES GETS ALL THAT. A CONNECTIVE ITTY FOR THAT INFORMATION AS WELL. AND IF I COULD SHARE REAL QUICK. IN AND IN A NOD TO ACCESS EACH OF YOU THAT'S ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE'VE BEEN ALL THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER. AND IN MY TENURE AS DIRECTOR JUST TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOUR OF THE JOURNEY. I'VE RAISED FEES IN OUR SEASON PROGRAM A RAISE FEES AND ARE SIXTEEN HUNDRED LAKE AND STREAMBED ALTERATION AGREEMENT POGRAM OF RAISE FEES TO DO ARE SICK WHAT. WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT I TRIED TO RAISE FEES ON COMMERCIAL FISHING I THINK THAT'S WHAT MISTER MCGUIRE WAS ALLUDING TO A MOMENT AGO. I WE TRIED TO SOLVE SOME OF THIS FUNDING BY USING THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. WE TRIED AND IDEA OF USING THE TIRE RECYCLING PROGRAM CAL RECYCLE. WE'VE TRIED AUGMENTATIONS OF GENERAL FUND INCLUDING LAST YEAR WHICH OF COURSE RAN INTO THE PANDEMIC SO I FEEL VERY BATTLE SCARRED. BUT NOW WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HAVING THIS DATA I DO SAYING SHOULD PUT TO REST IN MY MIND AT LEAST WHETHER THERE'S A PROBLEM AND WHETHER WE SUBSTANTIATED THE PROBLEM THERE'S AN ISSUE. I THINK NEXT IS WHAT WHAT WE DO ABOUT. GREAT CENTER STERN YOU RECOGNIZE. THE PERFECT TRANSITION DIRECTOR BOTTOM- SHE DID THE DILIGENCE ON ALL THIS AND PUTTING IT INTO STARK RELIEF I MEAN THE CUT I WOULD I GUESS FOR MY QUESTION IS I WANT TO KNOW. YOU HAVE IT IN YEAH THIS GAPS IN DOLLARS IT IN SOME WAY I SAW IT IN HOURS AS ADAM PERCENTAGES BUT LIKE I I'M TRYING TO RIGHT SIZE EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS HERE OF WHAT IT REALLY MEANS. SAID TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE SO IF WE APPROPRIATE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE FOR ALL THE BACKLOG OF FIRE MAINTENANCE THAT NEED TO BE DONE IN ALL THE DIFFERENT HABITATS THAT YOU ALL HELP MANAGE. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS GETS YOU HOW FAR ON ONE OF THOSE BAR CHARTS AND HOW MUCH FURTHER DO WE NEED TO GET TO GO. SOONER THIS WILL ALSO COME UP IN THE NEXT. AGENDA ITEM BUT- HERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSCORE. IT AS I'VE LEARNED IN THIS BUSINESS DISCIPLINE OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING A METRIC THE WIDGET YOU'RE USING TO JUDGE IS NOT DOLLARS. IT'S LABOR HOURS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE YOU'RE BENCHMARKING YOUR SERVICES AGAINST ALL THE TASKS SO I'LL EXAGGERATE. LIKE SAY A SERVICE AREA IS UP WE CAN JOIN MEANT OF YOUR LANDS THEN YOU'RE WORKING BACKWARDS WELL WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROPERTIES. AND THEN YOU'RE DOING ALL THESE TASKS LIKE CHANGE THE TOILET PAPER IN THE RESTAURANT RIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE FIGURING OUT THE PERSON HOURS ACCUMULATED UP. SO WE DON'T USE THE METRIC OF MONEY. BY WE KNOW PERSON HOURS LABOR HOURS AND WHAT THE DATA IS SHOWING YOU IS A GENERALIZED MATTER WERE UNDER IT'S ABOUT A THREE AXIS PROBLEM. RIDE SO THEN WHAT ONE CAN DO AND OF LOGIC WISE IS REALIZE WE'RE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND OUR ANNUAL BUDGET IS ABOUT YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. BOUNCES AROUND. SO THEN YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT THREE ACTS PROBLEM MEANS NOW THAT TIMES THREE. IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY IN EVERY ISSUE BUT IT'S SOME GENERALIZED IT WAYS. AND THAT'S I THINK REALLY THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MOVE INTO THE QUESTION AROUND MONEY PER SE BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS IS DRIVEN AROUND PERSONALS. NOW CAN I TELL YOU WITH EACH INVESTMENT HOW THE GAP MAY SHRINK KIND OF. I THINK WHAT THE TOOL ALLOWS DID WAS ILLUSTRATE THE GAP AND UNDERSTAND WHERE IT MAY EXIST. IT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT INVESTMENTS FOR RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND REMEMBER THAT SLIDE IS NOT ALWAYS YOU NEED TO ADD HE Y. YOU CAN. DO ONE TIME AND TECHNOLOGY YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES. THE OTHER THING IS THE TOOL REALLY ISN'T SET UP ONLY PROJECT OR PREDICT THE FUTURE. IT'S MORE SET UP TO TAKE EACH YEAR AFTER THE FACT AND SCRUB THE NUMBERS AND SEE WHAT CHANGES WITHIN THAT LABOR OUR AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS KIND OF SCRUB THE NUMBERS AGAIN. SO I DON'T HAVE COMPLETE OVERSIGHT WITH THE TOOL I THINK YOU CAN MAKE SOME REASONABLE PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW IT WILL HELP WHAT I HAVE IS AFTER THE FACT. YEAH THE NUMBERS IT'S GOT TO GO- DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE BESIDES AFTER THE FACT NUMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS DESPITE YOUR SCARS HERE ANY ANY GREAT IDEAS HOW DO WE FIX THIS. ARE YOU CAN I MEAN THERE'S IN KICK IT TO US TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT- I THINK I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD URGE YOU TO. JUST WHERE THOSE CARS AS YOU KNOW BATON. MEDALS OF HONOR OF SOME SORT AND KEEP COMING BACK. WE NEED. WE NEED SOME KIND OF CREATIVITY HERE- AND BONDS ARE GOING TO FIX THIS. RIGHT I MEAN IT'S WE'RE TALKING OPERATIONS. FOR A LOT OF IT SO. ANY ANY NEW BRIGHT IDEAS. TWO ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION. BUT OF COURSE. IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO WAY AND NOW I'M BE GLAD TO SEE A HAND RAISED BY. FIRST ANSWER IS. YOUR STAFF RECOMMEND HOLD OPEN I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE GET TO ISSUE TWENTY NINE. AND IN MY OPINION I'VE EXPERIENCED HOLD OPEN IS A WAY IN WHICH DISCUSSIONS CONTENT CAN CONTINUE. AND THEN SECONDLY I'LL JUST NOTE THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SUBCOMMITTEE THREE MISTER BLOOM AT MONASH MAY WITH A DIRECT REPORT BACK. I RESPONSIBILITIES. WELL LOOK FORWARD TO I AM THE SAME EAGER ANTICIPATION I GUESS I WOULD SHARE WITH MY ASSEMBLY COUNTERPART THERE AND VERY CURIOUS YOU FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WHAT THE WHAT THE THINKING IS THERE A STRATEGY HERE MISTER IDEAL ARE YOUR RECOGNIZE. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBER SERGIO AG LOWER THE PUBLIC FINANCE- CITING JUST KIND OF THINKING OVERALL STRATEGY IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE THURSDAY BUDGET GAPS. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SLIDE THAT THE DIRECTOR HAD WAS ON DIFFERENT APPROACHES- THAT COULD BE USED TO ASPHALT THE GAS OVERALL IN TERMS OF CLARIFYING MISSION. ALL THESE MANDATES PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. ARE WORKING WITH EXTERNAL PARTNERS TO CLARIFY- TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT WHICH REALLY DOES HOLD INTO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM WE'RE WE'RE MAKING SOME KIND OF INITIAL ONE TIME. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND DIFFERENT ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT WHICH- YOU KNOW WILL HELP REDUCE THAT GAP AND THEN THIRD WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THE LABOR HOURS WHICH IS- YOU KNOW KIND OF HOW I WHAT WE USED TO- TO. LOOK AT THE DATA GAPS WINDSOR'S STATE BUDGET AND YOU KNOW WITH KNOWLEDGE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON. WHAT WE WILL BE DOING TO KIND OF ADDRESS THAT THE ON GOING- GAP I THINK THIS BUDGET REALLY DOES FOCUS ON THAT ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND PART OF THE- STATE THAT TAKING A STEP BACK AND THE OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK. I WE ARE LOOKING OVERALL AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE EFFICIENCIES- AND JUST MAKE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS WITH A ONE TIME INVESTMENT. BUT WE DO PLAN TO CONTINUE EVALUATING AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON EVERY KIND OF ONGOING SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION- WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. BY THIS DATA SAID REALLY DON'T PROVIDE US A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO DIG IN FURTHER AND SEE WHAT THE BEST AND MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACHES ARE. NOT MISLEADING LEVINE- FOLLOW UP THERE- YOU S. IS DAD. THAT- YOU'RE FIRST. TO VERSUS SO ARE WE GONNA HERE SOMETHING BACK THIS YEAR. WE'RE GONNA HEAR OMETHING BACK BEFORE THE MAY REVISE YOU THINK WERE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY PUT SOME. IDEAS ON THE TABLE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE HEARING OF WILLINGNESS FROM. AT LEAST I DON'T YOU KNOW. HOW TO SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR BUT CERTAINLY FROM. YOU KNOW YOUR CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK AN EAGERNESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO HEAR SOME. SOME NEW THINKING SO IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE THIS YEAR. OR IS THAT A FUTURE YEARS CONVERSATION. AND SO. AT THIS POINT CAN'T MAKE A COMMITMENT ON TIMING- I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY THAT WE CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT AWAY ANOTHER. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE CONTINUE TO VALUE DEPENDS OF TIMING WISE- YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE. A- PLAN FOR THIS YEAR BY. REALLY THE- DATA WAY. DEPARTMENT HAD THE- TONS OF. IN A TO DEVELOP REALLY DOES PROVIDE THAT. BAGRI DATA AND PROVIDES THE ESTATE. AND A ALLEGE- IN A LOT OF COLLECTING. YOUR TO DETERMINE YOU KNOW FUTURE. CAN I CAN I SAY A TWO. NO YOU CAN'T PROMISE. THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SOMEBODY THIS- BUT- YOU KNOW DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE FOR. UP OF DOING SO. MAY I MEAN THAT THAT THERE ARE STILL BECAUSE BE A WIN HERE TO PUT SOME. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA VERY QUICKLY HERE. NAY YEAR ANOTHER. CYCLE OPPORT. ALSO TO PUT IDEAS VOTERS POTENTIALLY I THINK PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO DEAL WITH IT I KNOW WITHIN THE RANKS PEOPLE LOVE THEIR POWER. RANGERS THEY LOVE THEIR WARDENS A LOT OF YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE A RECREATION OR HUNTER OR JUST SOMEBODY LOVES YEAH. LIKE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEEDS NEED MORE OF THESE. WE WANT PEOPLE HIRED IN THIS SO- AND WE'RE COMING AT I MEAN I CAN I RECOVERY HOPEFULLY AT A COPAY DAY. THIS SET. IS IN AND- RICH SECTOR TO FURTHER INVEST IN SO I JUST WANT TO GET CLARITY THAT YOU'RE NOT CLEAR ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SINCE. SOLUTION IDEAS RIGHT NOW BUT YOU'RE NOT SAYING YOU WON'T. THAT FAIR TO SAY. YEAH THERE'S A NOT MAKING A COMMITMENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER OKAY I'LL TAKE THE OTHER BUT I'LL TAKE IT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE FOR THAT. MISS TAYLOR SWIFT THE ALEJO YOU'VE YOU'VE- ARE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION I GUESS WE WOULD SAY. FORMER LEADERS WOULD SAY YOU'VE PUT IT IN I TELL X. UNDERSCORED PUT IT IN BOLD THAT THAT AND MOST OF THE SERVICERS WE'RE NOT EVEN AT A THIRD OF WHAT THE FUNDING SHOULD BE I MEAN I MEAN SORT OF LIKE A PUNY LITTLE GOAL MAY BE. TO GET TO A THIRD OF WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING CAN YOU. OUR COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK IT'S NICE TO HAVE THE DATA IN IN PICTURE FORM ISN'T IT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES BRING YOUR EYES TO IT AND I THINK IT IS- PARTICULAR. STRIKING THAT THE LARGEST GAPS AND THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HOURS NEEDED TO MEET THE MISSION- ARE IN THOSE KIND OF CORE PUBLIC TRUST AREAS THE SPECIES PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WHERE THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC TO HOLD OUR OUR RESOURCES M. TO PROTECT AND CONSERVE OUR RESOURCES. AND ALSO I THINK WORTH HIGHLIGHTING THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WILL FACE INCREASING CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE- AND SO THAT THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO MEET THE MISSION COULD. HAVE CONCEIVABLY GROW IN THE COMING YEARS AND COULD TAKE A ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES SO- I THINK I THINK THAT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DROPSHIP WE HAVE OUR CHALLENGE BEFORE US IT'S NICE TO HAVE THE DATA. TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT THE THAT THIS REALLY IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS STARTING TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT WHAT DO WE HOW DO WE HANDLE THIS WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS- BECAUSE- AT THE GAPS ARE SIGNIFICANT. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S REALLY NO ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE YOU KNOW. I GUESS I'M A SIMPLE PERSON I THINK I LIKE THIS SHORT TERM GOAL OF LOOKING AT ONE THIRD OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WHAT A GOOD JOB GOVERNMENT'S DOING SO IF WE DO A THIRD OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING I GUESS THAT'S A- THAT'S A- THAT'S THE CEILING SO FAR NOW BUT- LET'S. THANK YOU FOR THE- INPUT KNOW SOME PEOPLE BEEN EAGER TO TALK ABOUT BIO DIVERSE- AND ARE TIME. ON THE AND A THAT THE REST. CIVIL DIRECTOR. OF ONCE AGAIN PLEASE PROCEED. BASICALLY. NINE- ISSUE TWENTY NINE. AND COMING OUT OF THE CAR WE JUST. RECALL ONE OF THE SLOW. THOSE THE IN WHICH YOU CAN DEAL WITH YOUR GAS. SO IN THAT SPIRIT WHAT IS BEFORE YOU IS A BUDGET CHANGE PURPLE WHICH A COME TO US OF. AMOUNT OF ONE AND IN THE- IT'S JUST A TOUCH OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ON FORTY TWO MILLION OF THAT IS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND THREE MILLION IS ONE TIME USE THE LAST BEST OF PROFIT. TWO THROUGH THIS I WHY TIME INVEST I THINK WE CAN MAKE NOTE OF DE. IMPROVE IN AREAS THAT MATTER FOR A MISSION. WE SHAPE THIS. USING DATA YOU JUST ME YOU THROUGH IN THE AGENDA ITEM. AND THROUGHOUT THE VERY INVESTMENTS IS THIS YEAR IN THIS ERA OF. WE CAN DO BETTER WE NEED TO DO BETTER ONE TIME INVEST IS A WAY TO DO BETTER. HERE'S HOW FORTY FIVE BROUGH OUT AT A OVERVIEW OF. AND THEN BECAUSE TAKE ANY- FOR AREA OF. INVEST IS INTO CHIU.

URBAN AREA DON'T HAVE RESTROOMS. THEY DON'T HAVE SIGNAGE. SO WE LIKE TO IN. ARLA MANAGE. WITH OUTREACH TO COME. AND BROUGH THE OF EARLY FOR CALIFORNIA. ENJOY COMMUTER IN. OR LOT OF OUR- DON'T HAVE WHICH HAVE BETTER SIGNED ABOUT THE TRUE. ANKLE VALUE AND THE DIE WITH NAY AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY. AND THEN ONE SMALL WIND ITEM SEVEN HOW FIFTY DOLLAR WHICH WE WOULD USE FROM THE FUND. MODERNIZE OUR LIFE PLAN FOR HUNTER. AND ANGLERS WHY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL WE'RE MOVE OUT OF PAPER TO DIGITAL THIS CREATES BUSINESS EFFICIENCY FOR US. ALSO OUR- ISSUE ABOUT. ONE THOUSAND- IN THE FOR AND SHE- MORE OF THOSE WARNINGS ARE BECAUSE A HUNTER AND ANGLER. DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ALL ON THE LAN REAL OF THE REGULATE THAT UP. I DID YOU THIS. MAKING IT. VERY AND APPS. WE BOTH. I AM. WILL CHANGE AND OUR ONE OFFICER WILL HAVE FREEDOM TIME. TO DEDICATE THAT. FREED UP TO MORE. BERMAN THE WITH THE PLAN WHY. BOB TRUST. THAT'S. TOUGH TO BOTTOM KIND OF QUICK SUMMARY OF THE FIVE NINE I'LL STOP THERE ANY BY SO THEORY IS THE WAR THERE THE. PERSON OR THE HIGH OUT THERE THEY STOPPED TO ASK. FOR THEIR LAW TO DON'T HAVE A SENSORY PLAY YOUR PHONE HERE'S THE APP. THE HIT YOUR CREDIT CARD OR IT RIGHT NOW MOVES TAKE CARE THIS I KNOW YOUR LIFE. FIRST ISSUE. WAR JUST GET YOUR LICENSE RIGHT NOW IS THAT SORT OF WHAT YOU WERE. BE ALL. NINE FISH AND HUNTING IN THE- WE. ALLIES IS IF I. WHAT I SHOULD CLARIFY. IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THE- THERE ARE UP TO. RIVER THEY MAY. NOT KNOW THE FROM THE BRIDGE. OF TO THE ROCK DOWN. IS A- NO TAKE STRESS OF THE RIVER YOU CAN. TAKE A HOME. BECAUSE THEY MAY. REALIZE THE REGULAR. OF TO THE WATER. ARE SCHOOL WAY OF DOING. IS HAD TO CARRY AROUND A PAPER. THAT LIKE ONE. RUN ONS. OVER HUNDRED PAGES. DESCRIBING ALL THESE REGULATE. WE ARE NOW. TO ALL. SO THAT IN ANGLER IN THE- ASSUMING SERVICE. COULD FIVE THEIR- LOOK. AND THEN HAVE THE- FOR THEM RIGHT THERE IN THE. FIELD YOU COULD WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT. WERE THE BEST FISHING ON THAT PATH THAT THEY WOULD BE TO HACK THAT WE'RE NOT SLATED. TO CAN. THERE EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO STICK WITHIN THAT SAME- PROPOSED DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU COULD- FUND DIFFERENT MIXES OF OFFENDING WITHIN THESE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES ARE FUN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS JUST THAT MOUNTAIN MOST OF THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT FOCUS ON THE SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AREA THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED AS WHERE THE BIGGEST GAP IS. ONE EIGHT ONE THAT DOES IS THE VEGETATION MAPPING SO IF YOU WANTED TO FOR EXAMPLE PUT GREATER EMPHASIS ON ON THAT CATEGORY OF ACTIVITIES YOU CULD. SHIP SOME FUNDING TO FIND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE FOR THE VEGETATION MAPPING OR SOME OTHER ONE TIME ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESS THAT- AREA OF ACTIVITY SO- DECENT PROPOSAL FOR YOU BUT NOT YOUR ONLY APPROACH I THINK THE ONE AREA THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS FOR THAT SMALL LINE ITEM THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. DOLLARS FOR THE HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE SYSTEM UPGRADES THAT DOES SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD VERY JUSTIFIABLY BE FUNDED THROUGH USER FEES RATHER THAN THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY CLEAR BENEFICIARY SO YOU COULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK INTO WHETHER THERE MAY BE OTHER FUNDING AVAILABLE- FROM THOSE USER FEES TO SUPPORT AT LEAST A PART OF THAT COST TO FREE UP SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES- BUT OVERALL AT REASONABLE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU- VICE CHAIRS DOT DOLLY. YOU RECOGNIZE I JUST WANTED. THIS IS FOR THE DIRECTOR- AS SOMEBODY WHO IS AN AVID HUNTER AND FISHERMAN AN OUTDOORS PERSON I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE OVERLAY FOR THE MAPPING- I ACTUALLY PAY- I THINK IT'S THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR TO ONYX HOT WHICH IDENTIFIES THE ZONES AND- PARCELS SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON WHERE YOU'RE AT ACTUALLY IS CRITICAL AND IT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT TOOL FOR. THOSE OF US WHO RESPECT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE WAY WE WANT TO BE AND NOT ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROPERTY BUT MY QUESTION IS THERE ABILITY- TO. ALLOW I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GO IN AND PURCHASE YOUR TAGS OR YOUR LICENSE IN YOUR IN A DRAW FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF YOU GET DRAWN FURTHER SAID TAG. AND- YOU KNOW IT'S IF IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER THAT TELLS YOU HOW THE TAX SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- PROBLEMS IS WITH MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT AS IT SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THAT SOMETIMES YOU. NEED A STAMP ON IT IF IT'S A YOU KNOW- MIGRATORY BIRD LYSONS AND SO IS THERE SOME WAY TO DIGITIZE THAT SO THAT. YOU COULD JUST PUT MY NAME IN BRIAN DOLLY AND YOU KNOW. WHAT I'VE ALREADY PURCHASED THAT I PURCHASED MY TECH ONLINE SO I KNOW YOU HAVE A STAMP ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. FOR LIKE A MIGRATORY BIRD BUT YOU'RE UP LINK UP JAN GAME AND THOSE I KNOW ARE ON THE STATE SIDE. ARE RIGHT ON YOUR RIGHT ON YOUR LICENSE SO IS THERE SOME WAY WE COULD. MAKE THAT SO THAT THE ONE THAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER WITH THE WARDEN THEY GO HEY WHERE'S YOUR ID YOU SHOW YOUR ID'S GOT YOUR PICTURE ON IT THEY KNOW WHAT YOU. AND THEY ARE ABLE TO TOUCH THEIR COMPUTER AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU PURCHASED. YES THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED. AWESOME THAT'S- PART OF. THE THEORY BEHIND THIS. A MINUTE AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE MAY NOT GET THERE COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. OFTEN WHEN WE'RE DOING TECHNOLOGY CHANGE WE HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF PROCESS WE NEED TO GO THROUGH WITH THAT. CALIFORNIA ARMINE TECHNOLOGY AND SENATOR ANOTHER ASPECT WITHIN THIS SPACE IS- WHEN YOU PURCHASE A LICENSE PARTICULARLY WITH FISHING. OUR WHOLE WAY HAS BANNED ITS GOOD FOR JUST THE REMAINDER OF THE CALENDAR YEAR OF COURSE IF YOU BUY IT IN SEPTEMBER IT'S NOT AS- BAD AS MUCH VALUE IF YOU HAD BOTHERED AND- YOU KNOW JANUARY. AND WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO ENSURE HE IS. FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE IT'S GOOD FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. ALL OF THESE ARE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CAN INCREASE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO BREAK THE BARRIER. AND BE OUTSIDE WAR. BEING OUTSIDE MORE AS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE NOTICING IN THE PANDEMIC. AND AS THE FEES OUR HUNTERS AND ANGLERS IN THE STATE THEY DON'T PAY THE HIGHEST FEES IN THE NATION- BUT THEY PAY SOME OF THE HIGHEST FEES- I DO THINK THERE IS A BROAD BENEFIT WHEN WE CAN MAKE THESE TECHNOLOGY. IMPROVEMENTS FOR HUNTERS AND ANGLERS I AM IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THE AROUND IT WHENEVER YOU PURCHASED A LICENSE IT'S GOOD FOR LIKE A FISHING LICENSE THREE OR SIXTY FIVE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THEM IN MY OPINION THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE SHOULD SPEND MORE MONEY BECAUSE I THINK YOU'LL ACTUALLY. RECEIVE MORE MONEY IF THE PROCESS WORKS IN A BETTER WAY AND IT LOOK. THOSE OF US WHO UDERSTAND. THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING OUT IN THE IN THE OUTDOORS AND RECREATION IN THE FAMILY VALUES IN THOSE THINGS. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE MONEY IT'S IT IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT EASY SO WE CAN ABIDE BY THE LAWS AND ACTUALLY. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AND ENJOY THE THINGS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE CARED ABOUT THE PROTECTIONS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING. A FISH IN THE WRONG PLACE OR OR IT'S JUST CASUALLY SORT OF BARTLETT TOOK I MEAN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF AS YOU KNOW. RESTRICTIONS AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THOSE BUT WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK ON THIS. AND I THOUGHT WHEN THE RANGER PUT YOUR NAME IN THE MACHINE IT LIT UP LIKE A LAS VEGAS SIDE. SLOT MACHINES NOW THAT'S A- VERY GOOD THAT'S A CLARIFICATION SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MR HERE. I'LL BE QUICK LOOK I THINK THE ONE THING I JUST WANNA SAY IN REGARDS TO YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR SAID BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MANDATE SIX ADDRESS THAT'S BEEN ADVANCED BY. THE LEGISLATURE IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE SEEN- CHALLENGES WITH THEIR BUDGET BUT- I GUESS THIS IS IT. BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DOESN'T THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT ADVANCE SOMEBODY CHANGE RIPPLES. IF THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE A DIFFERENT DOLLARS. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS WELCOME TO GO TO PUT ADDITIONAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS FORWARD. TO BE A RECOVER WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL MANDATES MAYBE. I THINK THAT GETS US BACK TO THE BIG PICTURE. IS THAT. LOOK THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE. IN THIS FORTY FIVE MILLION. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE. I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WHEN HE SAYS WHY DON'T WE JUST KEEP GOING IN AND POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT USER FEE INCREASES WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT USER FEE INCREASES. IT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR ANYOTHER DEPARTMENT- IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING- WILDLIFE. AND CONSERVATION. AND HABITAT. THEN WE HAVE TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. AND DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN. TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN RESOURCES IN THE STATE. ESPECIALLY IN THE AGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET AHEAD IF WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR BY YEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE CONTINUED TO FOR SIX FLIPPING YEARS WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR BY YEAR. AND I SAY THAT IS. THIS ISN'T JUST THE LEGISLATURE'S FAULT. THIS IS JUST AS MUCH. THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAULT THE DEPARTMENT'S FAULT. FOR NOT PUTTING FORWARD A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT. THAT CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S CRITICAL. BECAUSE I HEAR ABOUT THE MANDATES. BUT AGAIN. DURING ANY BUDGET- LONG TERM FULL TIME FINDING IS ALWAYS WELCOME- BYE ONE QUESTION I WOULD SAY TO. THE DIRECTOR MISTER DIRECTOR AND WE CAN TAKE THIS OFFLINE. IN THIS IS. VERY SPECIFIC TO THE NORTH COAST. BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET A UPDATE ON THE L. STAY. OUT FOR. HOME AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AGAIN DIRECTOR WE CAN TAKE THAT OFF LINE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AND EXPECT YOU TO HAVE IT IS THAT'S- VERY. FOCUSED ON THE NORTH COAST AND THINK YOU CAN MISTER DIRECTOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SOONER I'LL ASK. JUST CONTACT YOURS NEXT WEEK RELATIVE TO THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH. BEFORE GOING TO CENTER STERN WITH GO BACK TO VICE CHAIR DOLLY HAS A FOLLOW UP. SO ONE OF THE THANK YOU. FOR THE DRUG DRUG ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT SEE. IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THE- THE MARIJUANA- PROLIFERATION AND THE- AND THEN BAYERN MENTAL PROBLEMS AT WORK ARE FACED WITH THE ILLEGAL GROWS- MAINLY. ELISE MY DISTRICT CITY COUNTY IS JUST. COMPLETELY CRAZY RIGHT NOW SO IS THERE WHAT'S THE PLAN. FOR CEMENT AND- THOSE TYPE ACTIVITIES- IN YOUR BUDGET. SO THE REASON YOU DON'T SEE IT IN THIS AGENDA ITEM SENATOR IS THIS IS A SET OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY GENERAL FUND. AND THE ITEMS IN THIS PACKAGE ON THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE KIND OF FAMILIAR BECAUSE WE PROPOSED MANY OF THEM ALMOST A YEAR AGO. AND THEY ALL HAD TO BE TABLED ON BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC KIND OF. WHIPLASH COMING OUT OF THE CODED EXPERIENCE WHICH A YEAR AGO WAS MUCH NEWER FOR ALL OF US. THIS PACKAGE ALSO HAS HAD A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER. I HAVE ENGAGEMENT AROUND DESIGN SO WE THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT MIGHT BE A BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE SAID A ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT ENOUGH OF OUR DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS MAY BE ABLE TO SEE THEIR INTEREST AND- ALSO THE CANNABIS WE HAVE A GRANTING PROGRAM UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR. AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BUSY AND GROWING NO PUN INTENDED- ENGAGEMENT WITH EACH OF THE COUNTIES PARTICULARLY THE SHERIFF LEVEL. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT REALLY RELATES TO OUR PROGRAM. IN OUR PROGRAM IS REALLY DRIVEN AROUND THE ONGOING PERMANENT NEED. WHEREAS THESE ARE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS WHICH IS WHY. IN MY OPINION LA- MAKES A FAIR CRITIQUE OF THIS ONE TIME PACKAGE YOU'RE NOT INVESTING AND SPECIES OR PERMITTING. MY ANSWER IS TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THOSE SPACES. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ONGOING PERMANENT INVESTMENT NOT ONE TIME. SO SIR MOST OF OUR CAMPUS WORK IS OVER IN ANOTHER PART OF OUR BUDGET THAT'S AROUND ONGOING AND PERMANENT. NOT THIS ONE TIME. FIVE FINANCE MISTER AGUILAR VIEWER WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN. YES I GUESS- DRIVE OVER THE HEART OF FINANCE- SO JUST- KIND OF ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND INTO WHAT DIRECTOR OUTSIDE ON THE KIND OF TAX FUND SO THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROPOSED AND THE BUDGET YEAR FOR DEPART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE I RELATE THAT TO THEIR CANNABIS EFFORTS ADDING SPECIFICALLY- M. PROP SIXTY FOUR ONE OF THE ALLOCATIONS- DEPARTMENT RECEIVES- IT IS BASED OFF OF. CANNABIS TAX. WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING FUNDING AND THAT REVENUE AS A YEAR OVER YEAR OTHER DEPARTMENTS GETTING AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR- AND A LOT OF THAT DOES GO TO CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT. DOES NOT IN THIS B. C. V. BUT IT IS IN THEIR BUDGET AND THAT'S CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE IT- IN THE AGENDAS AND OF THE PROPOSAL- THE INCREASE JUST GOES INTO THEIR BASELINE BUDGET. AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT WORK FOR CANDIDATES. THANK YOU THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION CENTER STARTED TO RECOGNIZE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I APPRECIATE ACTUALLY YOU'VE BEEN SORT OF- DIRECTOR TOUCHED ON WHAT MY QUESTION IS CAN BE ABOUT WHICH IS THAT. ONE TIME VERSUS LONGER TERM I JUST WANT TO PULL THAT THREAD A LITTLE MORE HERE G. IS BECAUSE IT IT SEEMS LIKE. I MEAN. IT'S NOT ALL OR NOTHING RIGHT YOU CAN DO SOME MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLANS THAT DON'T HAVE A MIX THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT SOMETHING PRECLUDING YOU SAY FROM. WE KEEP GIVING YOU A LONGER TERM ENCUMBRANCE PERIOD AND SAY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TACKLE- THIS SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN. OR YOU KNOW FOCUS ON SOME SOME SORT OF MORE PUBLIC FACING VISIONARY MISSION DRIVEN GOALS AND MAYBE MIXING THOSE IN WITH THAT REALLY CORE OPERATIONAL STUFF BUT JUST SO WE CAN SHOW EVEN WHAT WE MEAN YOU KNOW. AND I AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE CONSERVATISM IN SOME WAY THAT THEY'RE NOT ONE OF PROMISE OVER PROMISE AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER AN IN YEAR. FOUR FIVE- THAT'S ACTUALLY WE WE'RE GONNA HIT A CLIFF BUT I THINK WE NEED THAT URGENCY WE HAVE TO SET UP THAT- THAT EXPECTATION FOR OURSELVES AND SO I JUST. I DON'T KNOW IF. LMAO OR THE DEPARTMENT HAVE JUST HYPOTHETICAL- SORT OF- YOU KNOW SORT OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT KIND OF MULTI YEAR. BUT THE ONE TIME MULTI YEAR APPROACH COULD LOOK LIKE AND MAYBE WHAT OPTIONS WERE. ASSESSED OR WHETHER. IF IN DEPARTMENT LAND YOU'RE JUST SAYING YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE TIME WE'RE JUST GONNA STAY IN CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OKAY. SO THEN YOU HAD YOU DIDN'T REALLY D THAT THINKING THERE BUT IT'S GOT AT LEAST BEING YOUR SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. THINKING RIGHT OF WHERE IN SOME OF THOSE EARLY. I DON'T COME SHOVEL READY MISSION DRIVEN MULTI YEAR INITIATIVES THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW- CAN EITHER OF YOU JUST WAIT WAIT ON THAT A LITTLE MORE. MISS SELLERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST. HI YOU'RE PROBABLY DIRECTED BETTER POSITION THAT THAT EXAMPLE WE GAVE IN OUR REPORT WAS THE ONE THAT SENATOR STERN MENTIONED WHICH IS THAT RECOVERY PLANS FOR INDIVIDUAL SPECIES THAT SEEM LIKE A DISCRETE ACTIVITY BECAUSE AS YOU. AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR IF IT'S ONE TIME MONEY EVEN FOR SPRING AND ACROSS MULTIPLE YEARS WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT IT'S A DISCRETE ACTIVITY THAT DOESN'T KIND OF. LIVE LONGER THAN THE FUNDING SO THAT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD DISCRETE ACTIVITY TO US AND WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR ONGOING FUNDING THAT THEN- HAD TO BE RETRACTED DUE TO THE- AND- I MAKE. PHYSICAL CONDITION BUT WITH GETTING AT THOSE SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION GOAL THAT WE HAVE ARTICULATED- THAT THAT R. AS BEST PRESENT IN THIS PACKAGE BUT DR BONHAM OUGHT. FOR TO YOU. IS SANDRA I'LL TRY TO. THINK OF OUR EXAMPLE HYPOTHETICAL THAT MAY RESONATE WITH THE PANEL THE MEMBERS. SO I CAN THINK OF TO. SO WE PROPOSE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO PURCHASE A NEW OR FIXED WING AIRCRAFT. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE CLOSE TO COMPLETING A FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS TO GET THE FIRST EVER OCEAN HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN FOR WALES. I THINK IN THE NATION. AND WE HAVE NEWLY CREATED STATE REGULATIONS TRYING TO MANAGE THE DELICACY BETWEEN MARINE MAMMALS AND ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL FISHERIES CRAP. SO IF ONE WERE TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE I COULD PROJECT WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL WORK IN THIS SPACE. AND THIS ADDITIONAL WORK COULD MEAN YOU TRY TO BUILD OUT- MARINE MAMMAL PROGRAM. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE LESS THAN TEN MONTHS OF WALES. AND WE CAN KEEP A COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY THAT'S IN OUR THIRD MOST VALUABLE FOR HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. SO YOU COULD USE THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO GET A BOMB AND YOU COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT OVER TIME HOW YOU TAILOR THAT TOOK US. I GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE. NOW LANDS NOT THAT I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT AN INTEREST OF YOURS- SO AS YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING THROUGH OUR SCIENTIFIC PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTED UNDER STATE LAW. WHETHER THEY SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T THE FACT IS THEY EXIST ACROSS LARGE PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO MODERNIZE A LOT OF OUR TRANSPORTATION GRID. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION WHILE LIFE AT THE SAME TIME YOU CAN THINK ABOUT CONNECTIVITY. SO YOU MAY BE. YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AROUND CREATING CHANGES TO CAPTURE ANIMALS WHEN THEY'RE IN HARM'S WAY AND MOVE THEM YOU CAN ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU BRING A MARRIAGE- BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION WILDLIFE SIMPLY BILL TWELVE EIGHTY TWO STARTED THIS. AND THEN THINK ORIGINALLY ABOUT CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS WELL TO DO THAT YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN DO MAPPING IN PLANNING AND YOU ALMOST NEED A MULTI UNIT YOU KNOW IT NEVER. I THINK THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT. HERE'S THE CABBIE OUT- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR IN THIS WE'RE IN A TOUGH ECONOMIC SITUATION AND I YOU KNOW I'M FOCUSED ON ONE TIME BECAUSE ONGOING AND PERMANENT IS MORE CHALLENGING. WHERE DO I FIND REVENUE SOURCES FROM GOING IN PERMITTING. V. P. N. CREASES WON'T DO IT GENERAL FUND IS CHALLENGING YEAH THAT'S PART AND PARCEL OF THE STRUGGLE I THINK AND IF YOU KNOW FINANCE WITH ONE AWAY IN THERE I THINK THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF THE- DESIRE. BUT THE DIFFICULT. BUT I WOULD BE I WOULD APPRECIATE IN IN SAY JUST GIVEN OUR LAST CUT- THE LAST ISSUE WE SORT OF WRESTLED WITH. WHAT'S A STABLE FUNDING STRATEGY COULD LOOK LIKE BUT IS THERE A VERSION AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THAT SORT OF MAKES OF. ONE TIME STARTED AT CAPITAL INVESTMENT THE DIRECTORS TALKING ABOUT BUT THEN MAYOR BUT THAT'S SORT OF MARRIAGE TO- YOU ARE I DON'T CALL IT A FULL ON GOING BUT I GUESS- A MISSION COMMITMENT THAT KIND OF MULTI YEAR BASIS IS THEIR OPENNESS TO THAT. THAT KIND OF HYBRIDIZED APPROACH IF YOU WILL. SIR DR APARNA FINANCE. YEAH I THINK I WOULD SAY AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE DID LAST- RELATED TO. THE STATEWIDE BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT WAS. LIKE THE FIRST TWO YEARS WERE HIGHER INVESTMENT I THINK A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IT- PROVIDED A KIND OF A SMALLER ALLOCATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE OUT YEARS THAT DID ALL THE ONE EXAMPLE OF YOU KNOW ARE VERY RECENT. REVOLTED BY THE MINISTRATION WHERE IT IS NOT IN THE SPECIES MONITORING REALM WHERE WE DID KIND OF TAKE A HYBRID APPROACH OF A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INVESTMENT IN THEFIRST COUPLE YEARS ACKNOWLEDGING AVAILABILITY ONE TIME BUT THEN- KIND OF WAR A MORE MODERATE- OUT HERE- SO YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE EXAMPLES THAT YOU KNOW IT RECENTLY. I HAVE A LAST YEAR ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE- IN THAT KIND OF SCENARIO I YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU KNOW OPEN TO CONVERSE. ON THIS I BEEN JUST KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGE- STAFF CAPACITY WEIGHT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND SO IT'S AN EXPENSE THERE IS- YOU KNOW. ADDITIONAL NEEDS THAT REQUIRE STAFFING AND THEN YOU REQUIRE PERMIT LEVEL STAFFING BUT THERE IS ISN'T AN AGREEMENT- NO LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THEIR STAFFING THEN YOU'RE CREATING I NOW YOUR GAP. OR YOU HAVE PERMITS THAT POTENTIALLY BUT THEY'RE NOT THE FUNDING BEHIND IT AND THAT DOES CREATE YOU KNOW LIABILITY THEN IT KIND OF ONGOING FUNDING LIABILITY AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSALS- BUT YOU KNOW AS AS HE DOUBLED FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WHICH WE DID. PUT INTO THE BUDGET OTHER EXAMPLES- ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT. LOOK AT WHAT FURTHER ENGAGEMENT THERE. YEAH THOSE EGGS SUPER HELPFUL. I THINK PART OF THE- THANK OUR LEASE WITH SENATOR STERN UNDERSCORES A SORT IT'S LIKE IN THE SCHOOL SPACE AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET COMPUTERS FOR KIDS BUT YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY A 100% OF ALL THE COMPUTERS THIS YEAR BECAUSE IN THREE YEARS A 100% YOUR COMPUTERS CAN BE WORN OUT SO. SO WE ASSUME THAT WITH ONE AIRPLANE AND MAYBE ANOTHER AIRPLANE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THAT MODERNIZES THE FLEET I GUESS WHAT'S MISSING HERE IS SORT OF. WOULD WOULD I THINK WE'VE MET THE SENATOR IS GETTING AT IS YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP OF FOR INSTANCE THE VISITOR AMENITIES AND STATE LANDS IT'S GREAT THAT THERE'S SIX MILLION IN HERE. ONE TIME GET SOME TOILETS SOME VISIBILITY DONE BUT IF WE WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IS SIX MILLION AND A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM OR IS IT SIX MILLION AND A TEN MILLION DOLLAR IN IOWA. A BILL DOT SO WE GET SOME. R. I. OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK AND WHEN. AND IF WE'RE TALKING BOATS IS THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT ONE VOTE IT'S ONE VOTE ARE THERE. I CAN'T REMEMBER SHE PROBABLY KNOW THIS BUT IS THAT HOW MANY BOATS ARE IN THE FLEET AND IT WHAT IS OFF THE COAST VERSUS WHAT'S IN LAND AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE MATTER ALSO. ARE SO WE CAN HAVE THOSE. A LIMITING DISCUSSIONS LATER ON AND SEEING NO OTHER HANDS OUR GROUP HOLD THAT MATTER THE MOVE INTO ISSUE. NUMBER THIRTY END OF AN INVITE TO FORCE THE FIRE PROTECTION DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. AND- THE DEPARTMENT% OF WATER RESOURCES TO TALK ABOUT. ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALLOCATION. FOR CAL FIRE IS T. W. R. AND- THERE ARE PARKS SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE. WE HAVE. HI DIRECTOR DUGAN IS GOING TO START US OFF. THE CAT LITTER FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL KICK AT ALL OKAY THEN WE HAVE- I HAVE A COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENTS WHO COULD SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILS- SO THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TOO. THE PERSON CRITICAL DEPARTMENT NEEDS OR DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES ARE FACT CAL FIRE ALTHOUGH THIS PROPOSAL IS PART OF A BROADER ADMINISTRATION PACKAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. INTENDED FOR MAINTENANCE. HOWEVER DIFFERENT- INTERSTATE EVEN BETTER IN. HELP SUPPORT THE BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. YOU KNOW REDUCE THE NEED TO BUILD MORE COSTLIER- INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF YOU KNOW IT IS WRONG REALLY SUPPORTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLIMATE RESILIENCE GOALS- AND AGAIN WE HAVE REPRESENTED FROM DEPARTMENT THAT COULD SPEAK. TO THEIR SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS EITHER MORE QUESTIONS WHAT I FOUND I WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL THE DEPARTMENTS I THINK. I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO THEIR MOUTHS PART OF THIS STARTS WITH FINANCE IN AND PART OF IT. IT TALKS ABOUT THE WEEK THAT WE HAVE GIVEN IT OUT- GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCETHAT WE HAVE IN IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AT N. TWENTY MILLION. DOLLARS FOR PARK IS THAT. GIVEN THE FAULT IS THAT THAT'S THAT'S A- TO IT IN EVERY THANKFUL FOR THAT BUT GIVEN YOU KNOW. MAYBE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA THE BUDGET AS A STAFF REPORTS ANALYZE IS REALLY IS THIS THE TIME NOT TO- BE MORE- AGGRESSIVE AS FAR AS HE'S ONE TIME- DEFERRED- AS IN INVESTMENTS I GUESS THAT'S IT BECAUSE I'M SURE THE PARK PEOPLE IN THE US CAL FIRE GONNA SAY MORE IS BETTER RIGHT- BUT THE CHOICES THAT YOU MADE YOU KNOW YOU GOT. FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS WITH THE PARKS WITH ONE POINT TWO SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS IN RENT TWENTY MILLION I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE IS BUT IT'S A LOW PERCENT. FOR YEAH I GOT. I THINK WE ALL KNOW IT REALLY IS JUST YOU KNOW- ACKNOWLEDGING THERE'S MANY INVESTMENTS IN THE BUDGET ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AND A BIG PIECE OF THE INVESTMENT THIS YEAR WERE ALSO PART OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE- WOULD REALLY HELP SUPPORT ECONOMIC STIMULUS- YOU KNOW BROUGHT. AND SO. IT IS PART OF THE BALANCING OF THE PARTY THAN THE BUDGET WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INFORMATION IS ALL. YOU NEED WHICH IS WHY WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE- BUT AGAIN IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE AGAINST ALL THE OTHER PRIORITIES I WOULD YOU ALSO SEE ENDED BUDGET. WITH YOU KNOW RT FOR A PARTITION WALL LIFE- YOU KNOW- AGENDA ITEM IN A COUPLE- YOU KNOW MINUTES WILL BE THE CAL FIRE- YOU KNOW. BY RESILIENCE PACKAGES SO THERE'S A LOT OF. THAT DEMONSTRATION IT IS A FOCUSING AND TRY TO SUPPORT- AND A TWO HUNDRED THIS IS ALSO A PRIORITY- BUT THERE THERE'S OTHER PARTY NEEDS ABOUT EIGHT. AND WE'RE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS MISS EHLERS- YOUR INPUT. YOU MISTER CHAIR WE REVIEWED ALL THE PROPOSALS AND- I THINK THEY'RE ALL REASONABLE- WE'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MANY- IT RALLY WITH THAT ADDRESSES AREAS OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY AND IS A- THAT IS ONE OF THOSE DISCRETE PROJECTS THAT HAS A BEGINNING AND AN END- ALL THE DEPARTMENT HAD GOOD JUSTIFICATION AND A- CLEAR PRIORITIZATION PROCESS FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE FUNDS. SO NO CONCERNS TO RACE HERE YEAH NO I JUST SAY JUST IF THERE IS A TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS WERE PUT THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S LIKE ONE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH- AT AND THIS IS. THE LEAST OF ALL THE TIME THAT I'VE SAT IN THIS CHAIR IT'S WHEN WE SEE WE HAVE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT AND I'M THINKING ONE TWO HUNDRED FIFTIETH SEEM SKIMPY BUT- LET'S GO TO LET'S LET'S WAIT HAVE THE PARKS WHERE YET- MISS MCCOURT. DEPUTY MAKE WORK WITH THE WITH THE PARKS HERE'S- YOUR PROPOSED TO GET TWO HUNDRED MILLION OUT OF ONE POINT TWO SEVEN BILLION THE FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS OUTLOOK FOR THE- WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO DO WITH THAT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I ACTUALLY HAVE BRAIN DO WE HEAR FROM THE PARKS RIGHT IN THIS IS LIZ MCGRATH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR STATE PARKS AND I HAVE BRIAN DO WE HERE TO SPEAK TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL. FIFTY WE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD MORNING THE- BRAIN TO THE STATE PARKS ON THE CHIEF OF FACILITIES AND DEVELOPMENT-I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT THE- THE TWENTY MILLION. DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET- ISN'T VERY HELPFUL TO THE DEPARTMENTS- WORDS- FINALIZING A LIST NOW OF- HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. IN IN I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A SERVICE BASE BUDGET TODAY LIKE WILDLIFE HAS BUT BUT WHAT ARE THOSE GIVE CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE ONE POINT TWO SEVEN BILLION WHAT IS IN CRITICAL NEED. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOME. A RECENT PARK ARE CLOSED BECAUSE OF. ANOTHER OF HIS DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED THERE THAT THEIR PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO GET ACCESS TO WE HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT BE- WE'VE DONE US SO THAT WE DO ASSIGN A STATEWIDE SURVEY OF ALL OF THE- THE PROJECTS AND- THE CURE YOUR AGENDA NOTED THAT WERE AROUND FIVE. THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WE THEN I'D TAKE THAT LIST OF PROJECTS AND WE- WE BRING THEM INTO HIGH MEDIUM AND LOW PRIORITY AND I BELIEVE LAST TIME WE HAD THAT- THAT. THE RANKING- IT WAS- AND THEN THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RANGE OF THE HIGHEST OF PRIORITIES FOR STATE PARKS. VERY GOOD. D. W. R. I THINK WE HAVE- A DIRECTOR NEMETH YOU'VE GOT. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THIRTY YEARS AT WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND YOU GET THE LION'S SHARE OF THIS ONE TIME MEET HIS COLLOCATION- WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION CAN YOU GIVE THE SUBCOMMITTEES HOW DO YOU- HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU BEST SUPPLY THIS BAND AID TO THE PROBLEM. YEAH THANK YOU- MR CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS SO- AS A GENERAL MATTER- IN THE FLOOD WORLD ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES WITH ONGOING- FLOOD PROTECTION AND MAINTENANCE. IS HOW WE CONNECT STATE DOLLARS WITH LOCAL DOLLARS WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS AND- THE CHALLENGES OF- FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS HE'S WORKING WITH STATE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS SEES AT THE RIGHT TIME. WHEN LOCALS HAVE THE MONEY IS WHY- ON THE STATE SIDE WE'VE GROWN THIS BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- IF YOU ALL REMEMBER PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY WHICH PASSED I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. WE JUST FINISHED SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY REALLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THAT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME AND PART OF WHY IT TAKES A LONG TIME IS- HOW WE CONNECT ALL THESE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES- TO. SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS SO THAT HAS ESSENTIALLY GENERATED WHAT WE'VE ESTIMATED AS ABOUT. SIX pBACKLOG IN MAINTENANCE FOR HIGH PRIORITY MAINTENANCE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT- IS PART OF THIS REQUEST TODAY. FOR HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS OUR TOTAL HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT NEED IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- WE HAVE A LONG LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE IF YOU WILL AND- THESE ARE THINGS LIKE- LET THE EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION ACCUMULATION- AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO. THAT'S THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE NEED I THINK AS A GENERAL MATTER- IF OUR IF THE STATE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE ECONOMICALLY AND WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND- IT'S BEEN A WHILE- SINCE THE STATE HAS HAD- BOND ISSUES THAT ARE INVESTING. IN FLOOD PROTECTION NINE PROP ONE WE HAD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND WHAT WE CALL MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS AND I'M PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE- WE WERE STILL WORKING ON OUR PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY- AND DISTRIBUTION OF DOLLARS. SO THAT'S SORT OF THE FULLER CONTEXT IN TERMS OF FUNDING NEEDED FLOOD AND- HOW WE GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND- IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK FOR THAT SIR BILLION GRANTS IT IS ALMOST. THAT THIS THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD RESPOND WITH ADDING IS ZERO TO THE GOVERNORS- HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. PROPOSAL JUST THIS ONE TIME MONEY BUT LET'S HAVE CAL FIRE A DEPUTY- DUGAN. YOUR YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION BACKLOG AND YOU'RE GONNA GET TEN. THAT IS CORRECT HI GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MICHAEL DUGGAN WITH- THE CHIEF TECHNICAL SERVICES WITHOUT MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR TONY FARROW AND ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FACILITY FINANCE MANAGER- MR TRAY HUNTER- THE DEPARTMENT IS- WILL USE THAT INFORMATION IS FUNDING FOR A HUNDRED AND TEN IDENTIFY PROJECTS TOTALING TEN MILLION DOLLARS- THESE PROJECTS ARE LOCATED AT FIRE STATIONS CONSERVATION CAMPS. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES IN OTHER STATES- FACILITIES STATEWIDE. ROGER DODGER- DRESS CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES AND ENSURE CONTINUED OPERATIONS- ALL THESE FACILITIES OPERATE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. A COUPLE HOURS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD A SOLID FINANCIAL PLAN TO ENSURE THAT- YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THESE PROJECTS THROUGH TO COMPLETION. AND THIS APPROACH- THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH THE APPROACH- FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REDUCTION. AND REFLECTS THE DEPARTMENT'S TOP PRIORITIES. FOR THIS FUNDING WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ARE HAPPY ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU HAVE- YEAH IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD HIGHLIGHT TO US. OF THE CRITICAL ARE THE EXTREME I KNOW WE'RE TALKING CAL FIRE SUIT I DON'T WANT TO HEAR A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN IS ALL EXTREME BUT BUT WHAT IS THAT TOP. I CATEGORY OF WORK THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST GLARING. SHORTFALL SAID YOU HAVE. ARE PRIMARILY IT'S- FOR CONTINUED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS BUT ALSO- INSURING THE STATE MISSION- IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AS WELL ONE OF THESE PROJECTS- IS TIED TO THE LA MER- MORAN REFORESTATION CENTER. SO PRIMARILY IT'S TO. CONTINUE OPERATIONS- AND THEN- REALLY THE CRITICALITY OF HOW THAT AFFECTS- TAKING A STATION DOWN OR- HAVING US TO. KIND OF RE PLANNED DUE TO A FAILURE. OKAY LET'S SEE IF I HAVE HANDS UP BY MEMBERS. BUT IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT THAT IF WE ADDED ZERO TO THIS AND WE GIVE CAL FIRE A HUNDRED MILLION TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR BACKLOG OF A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION AND WE GIVE PARKS TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO TAKE CARE OF A ONE POINT TWO WHICH IS LIKE A SIX TO WHAT THEY HAVE. IN IN IN IN D. W. R. WE GET SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WHICH IS NOT EVEN YOU KNOW WHICH THEY GOT THREE BILLION OR FOUR SEVEN BILLION OF CRITICAL IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF A ONE TIME ADJUSTMENT- INVESTMENT TO THESE THINGS STILL TO GET US ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BUT IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE THINK ABOUT. THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT'S IT IT REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE LOOK TO THE EAST COAST AND IN WASHINGTON DC ON WHAT TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY THEY WOULD GIVE TO US SO. WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND SEE HOW EXPENSIVE WE CAN GET IN THIS- AT THE TIME WERE FLUSH WITH MONEY THANK YOU ALL- N. TALK ABOUT D. W. R. WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT. OF RESOURCES WE HAVE A GRAM OF WATER MANAGEMENT- PROPOSAL SIXTY MILLION FROM A GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR AND- THIRTY MILLION NEXT YEAR ARE CONTINUING EXCUSE ME. FROM AGAIN HER NAME IS DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE DO HAVE A FUNDING- PROPOSAL FOR A THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS- BUT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS- THIS IS FOR A GRANT PROGRAM THAT CAN SUPPORT- PROJECTS THAT AR IDENTIFIED IN CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS- AS YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THE DEADLINE FOR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN SUBMITTAL- WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS- TWO YEARS TO REVIEW THOSE PLANS FROM CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS SO WE ARE ON TRACK TO MAKE A DECISION- ON THAT INITIAL SET OF PLANS. BY ESSENTIALLY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE DOLLARS- WOULD GO FOR PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT- THINGS LIKE STORMWATER CAPTURE- SMALLER KINDS OF CONVEYANCE PROJECTS THAT CAN ASSIST WITH GROUND WATER RECHARGE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT- THAT ARE NEEDED IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ARE DEALING WITH THE MOST INTENSIVE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AS A GENERAL MATTER- THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A PROGRAM IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. A BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WILL ENABLE US TO ACTUALLY ISSUE THOSE GRANT DOLLARS BY THE CLOSE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AS I MENTIONED WHILE- THE DEPARTMENT IS REVIEWING THESE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED PLANS- THOSE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES ARE RIGHT NOW IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS WE WILL HAVE A PROGRESS REPORT AND- APRIL FIRST IN ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN WILL HAVE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS AFTER THAT SO WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL- THERE. IS AN ENORMOUS NEED FOR THESE KIND AS A DOLLARS AND- TO SUPPORT THAT AND- OF A SUSTAINED GRANDMA MANAGEMENT SO I'LL STOP THERE BUT DIRECTOR NAME IF YOU'VE READ THE ALLY OWES REPORT THEY'RE SAYING WE SIGMA WE UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL CRITICAL PUSH THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OUT. IF IT TRICKLES INTO NEXT JANUARY AS FAR AS THE WORKING DONE IT'S NOT LIKE THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND COULD IMPROVE I MEAN IT'S ALREADY BAD IT'LL BE BAD IN NINE MONTHS OR TEN MONTHS WHATEVER IS. I KNOW THAT FINANCE IS SITTING THERE AND THEY GOT THEY GOT A DIFFERENT ANGLE YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR. OF ARTIST DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE THE LA ROSE OBSERVATION HERE. I APPRECIATE THEIR OBSERVATION I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT- A PREVIOUS YEAR WHEN WE HAD- TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE WE GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN- AND FUNDING REQUESTS SO WE KNOW THE NEED IS THERE THE DEPARTMENT- AS AS YOU KNOW- THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON- HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS- THE NEED TO BRING. GROUNDWATER BASINS INTO SUSTAINABILITY AND- YOU KNOW FRANKLY JUST TO USE AN INFORMAL TERM I TAKE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS ALL IN AND I'M GETTING GOD CURRENT GRANT PROGRAMS OUT THE DOOR- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- SO THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS. I THINK ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES OF- THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT EIGHT- NEED IS THAT THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF ANXIETY AS AS EVERYONE LOOKS AT THE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO HAPPEN IN THIS KIND OF A RESOURCE SCARCITY ISSUE PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND PARTICULARLY- AND SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU KNOW STRUGGLE WITH- ECONOMIC. INEQUALITY IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THE DEPARTMENT REALLY WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THESE COMPETITIVE GRANT MAKING PROGRAMS AND WE THINK WE CAN DO THIS- WITH- THIS KIND OF A BUDGET ALLOCATION BUT POINT CERTAINLY NOTED OBVIOUSLY BY THE L. A. MISSY TAYLOR SWIFT BUT CAN YOU LET US KNOW ABOUT THE- WHY THIS IS SORT OF AN UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COST. YEAH THANK YOU MR CHAIR- RETAILERS WITH THE LEGEND LAST OFFICE SO WE- WE DO IN REVIEWING THIS AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT ANY ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY M. AS A DIRECTOR MENTION THESE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. HAVE THAT KIND OF DUAL CHALLENGE OF THEIR THEIR THE MOST OUT OF BALANCE AND THEY HAVE THE MOST EXPEDITED TIMELINES FOR GETTING BACK INTO BALANCE SO WE THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE STATE INVESTMENT IT IS JUST THE TIMING ISSUE THAT WE RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO GET DOLLARS EARLY I THINK PROBABLY EVERY DEPARTMENT YOU WOULD TALK TO WOULD SAY YES WE WOULD. LIKE AN EARLY ACTION ITEM SO WE CAN START A FEW MONTHS EARLY- BUT WE THINK YOU KNOW AS WE HAVE I'VE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS- COMMITTEE HEARINGS THERE THERE'S A PRETTY HIGH THRESHOLD ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT DOES LIMIT YOUR- FLEXIBILITY WHEN YOU COME TO PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR WHOLE BUDGET PACKAGE IN JUNE WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN DOLLARS OFF THE TABLE AS EARLY. AND WE DON'T THINK THAT THIS MEETS THAT HIGH THRESHOLD IT'S NOT A CRITICAL EMERGENCY IT'S NOT RESPONDING TO COATED- THESE ARE LONG TERM PROJECTS THAT WILL TAKE. MANY MONTHS IF NOT YEARS TO UNDERTAKE SO WAITING A FEW MORE MONTHS AND THERE IS- BROCK PROP SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS THAT ARE IN PROCESS NOW THAT WON'T GET OUT THE DOOR UNTIL MAY. SO WE THINK WAITING A FEW MORE MONTHS RUNNING ONE GRANT CYCLE RATHER THAN TO THAT ARE JUST A FEW MONTHS APART- WELL WILL NOT ONLY BE KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVELY EASIER FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND FOR APPLICANTS BUT ALSO- IN TERMS OF YOUR OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE- SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND TO CONSIDERING THE FULL AMOUNT. AS PART OF YOUR REGULAR BUDGET PACKAGE. MR FULLER FINANCE PLEASE A GIVE US YOUR INPUT GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS BRYAN FULLER PART OF FINANCE- BRIDGET KELLY WAS COMMENTS ON THE FULL SIXTY MILLION I JUST TO BUILD ON THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS EARLIER ON KIND OF THE PROGRAMMATIC SIDE OF- THE NEED FOR THE THIRTY MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR JUST JUST KIND OF HANG OUT A LITTLE BIT. REALLY JUST IDENTIFY THAT THE THIRTY MILLION BEING PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT YEAR REALLY ALIGNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER EFFORTS- TO- PROVIDE ECONOMIC STIMULUS AND SUPPORT OF ROBUST ECONOMIC RECOVERY SO GIVEN KIND OF THE- BROADER GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACCELERATING OUT THIRTY BILLION OCCURRING HERE WILL WILL HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THOSE THOSE BROAD BASED ECONOMIC RECOVERY- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS. THAT WE'RE BUILDING TOWARDS. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP. OKAY NO SENATOR STERN YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MR- AND THANK YOU- DIRECTOR NEVER THING AND- THE REST OF THE TEAM- JUST AS SOMEBODY WHO'S DEALING WITH MULTIPLE OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS OR- THE ANXIETY REFERRED TO IN THE GROWING COMMUNITY. IT DOES FEEL LIKE A CRISIS MAYBE IT'S NOT FELT EVERYWHERE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW GETTING READY FOR THE DEADLINES IN SIGMA IS DRIVING- A LOT OF TENSION OUT INTO VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND I REALLY I JUST WANT TO. SPEND ONE SECOND IF YOU COULD. DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON HOW. CRUCIAL THESE GRANTS ARE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW READY THEY ARE TO DO WITH IT ALL RIGHT MY SENSE IS THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT- DELAY IN GETTING A NEW ISSUANCE OF GRANTS OUT THE DOOR. AND JUST LIKE EVEN IF IT'S A MATTER OF FALLING BEHIND BY SIX MONTHS WHAT WHAT COULD THAT DO I GUESS TO SIGNIN BOWMAN TATIAN IN IN YOUR MIND- DIRECTION EMMA. THANK YOU SELLER LEADS THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO- I WOULD SAY THAT- SO HOW'S MY WORKS IS AS YOU ALL KNOW- THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. AGENCIES NEED TO REACH SUSTAINABILITY BY TWENTY FORTY AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW REMEDY IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- SOMETHING THAT HAS ESSENTIALLY TAKEN DECADES- TO CREATE AND THESE CHALLENGES OF. DAMAGE FROM WATER BASINS BUT- I WOULD SAY EVEN MORE THAN THAT IT'S ALL IT'S ALSO CREATED SOME CHALLENGES AROUND- WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE HE'S GROUNDWATER BASINS REALLY IN SELECT AREAS- ONLY IN SELECT AREAS HAVE THEY BEEN MANAGED AND- YOU KNOW FRANKLY PLACES LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE A LOT MORE AHEAD OF THE CURVE PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW A BROADER SET OF WATER CHALLENGES SO WE SAW IT PLAY OUT WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED BASINS- AND VERY FUNCTIONAL BASINS AND PARTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT CERTAINLY THE LACK OF MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER BASINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO FULLY SUPPORT HOW WE'RE GONNA GET FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY FORTY- TO SUSTAINABLE- SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER BASINS SO PART OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAM IS INVESTMENTS THAT. THESE LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO MAKE AND YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DRILLING MORE MONITORING WELLS THAT CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW WATER IS MOVING THROUGH DIFFERENT LAYERS- WITHIN- THEIR PARTICULAR- BASINS GEOLOGY. THAT IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL FOR- HOW ABOUT SIGMA IT WORKS TOGETHER WITH- THE WATER BOARD AND THE SAFER PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT WERE- USING OUR DOLLARS THAT DEAL WITH DRINKING WATER QUALITY. I'M IN WAYS THAT- ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO- PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER SICK MIND WE ARE NOT INADVERTENTLY. THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA. DEEPENING WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES AND- AND- THEN AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT KIND OF SAFER PROGRAM SO I THINK- YOU KNOW THE MORE INFORMATION. THAT WE CAN GET THE SOONER THE BETTER- IS GOING TO GET US ON AN IMPLEMENTATION TRACK FOR SIGMA- EVEN THOUGH THESE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS TAKE AWHILE- THEY TAKE AWHILE BUT- THE SOONER WE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION. THAT HELPS US- GUIDING FUTURE INVESTMENTS- THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE HITTING THAT TWENTY FORTY GOAL. SCORER AND REQUIREMENT ACTUALLY. MORE THAN A GOAL A REQUIREMENT. THANKS THANKS FOR THE CALL. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT GOT THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN THEY'LL GET THE SAFE DRINKING WATER PLANT AND IN A LOT OF US MIX THEM ALL TOGETHER SOME PEOPLE MAY MAKE SOME WITH A- HIGH CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAM BUT I'LL PUT THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF HOW THAT INTERPLAY IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD OBSERVE WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON SAFE DRINKING WATER AND NOW. THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN HAD IS WORTH THE LINKAGE. GREAT QUESTION SO THE DEPARTMENT IS THIS IS PROBABLY THE AREA IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT IS- WORKING MOST INTENSIVELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- SO. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE- WE HAVE GROUNDWATER BASINS- WE HAVE- A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WELLS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WELLS ARE- OPERABLE VERSES IN OPERABLE AND THAT THAT IS RELATIVELY NEW INFORMATION RIGHT SO. PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT COUNTIES WEREN'T REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT TO THE STATE BUT WE NOW HAVE. AS OF I THINK ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE NOW HAVE THIS. REALLY SIGNIFICANT PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE- INFORMATION DATABASE ABOUT- HOW MANY WELLS WE HAVE. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE. STATEWIDE IN FOR AROUND IS WHICH OF THOSE WELLS ARE ACTUALLY OPERABLE AND FUNCTIONING AND PROVIDING AND DOMESTIC WELL SOURCE SO- WHEN WE DRINK. L. DOWN A LITTLE BIT DEEPER ON INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THEIR REGIONAL BOARDS BECAUSE OF COURSE THOSE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN LOCAL BASE AND WATER QUALITY- REQUIREMENTS. WE LOOK TOGETHER AT THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE WHAT DOES THIS INFORMATION TELL US ABOUT- THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DO WE NEED- FROM THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY TO ASSURE HER. THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE WATER QUALITY REALM THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE IS WORKING TO FUND- IN OTHER WAYS AND THAT ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT- WHAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT SIGMA IS ACTUALLY WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED SO WE HAVE OPTIONS UNDER THE LAW TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE THREE KINDS OF DECISIONS ONE. YOU CAN HAVE A PLAN THAT IS WE DETERMINE IS ADEQUATE WITH RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND THEN- THOSE ARE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES NEED TO SUPPORT ANNUAL UPDATES AS TO HOW THEY'RE DOING BUT THE DEPARTMENT IN FIVE YEARS WILL ESSENTIALLY REEVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT PLAN IS STILL ADEQUATE SO THAT'S ONE DECISION THAT WE CAN MAKE AROUND PLANTS. THE SECOND DECISION AS WE CAN SAY THAT PLAN IS INCOMPLETE AND BY LAW THAT YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO MAKE IT COMPLETE SO IF WE LOOK AT THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PLANS AND WE SAY WELL THEY'RE MISSING SOME YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTAL PIECES OF INFORMATION OR- THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH OF A PLAN AS TO HOW AND WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY RELATED TO- DRINKING WATER WELLS WE CAN REQUIRE THAT BRUH- A DETERMINATION THAT A PLAN IS INCOMPLETE AND THAT WOULD COMPEL THOSE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THAT WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD. THE OTHER THING THAT WE CAN DO IS DETERMINE A PLAN TO BE INADEQUATE AND THAT'S WHEN THAT PLAN THEN GOES OVER TO THE WATER BOARD- AND THEY HAVE A VERY FORMAL PROCEDURE ABOUT PUTTING- I PLAN ON PROBATION AND THAT- EMPOWERS THE BOARD SHOULD ESSENTIALLY INSTITUTE INTERIM GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT MEASURES WHILE THAT- GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY IS PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE LAW SO WE HAVE ALL THOSE KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO YOUR INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE RELATING TO- GROUNDWATER QUALITY AND HOW THAT'S RELATING TO- PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OVER AT THE WATER BOARD. WITH THOSE SAFER DOLLARS AND- I WOULD SAY DO YOU HAVE YOUR IS WORKING VERY WELL THE STATE LEVEL WITH THE WATER BOARD AND AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF- OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVING INDEPENDENT- CREDIBILITY- FOR THE FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR YOU ALL I KNOW THAT THAT WAS A TOPIC OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO SENATOR MINING AND- AND WE ARE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO ARTICULATE HOW THESE PIECES MOVE TOGETHER. YEAH AND JUST FOR THE REPUBLICAN ALWAYS HAD AND THAT'S ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COVERED THESE ARE ONLY THE AGENCY'S RECOVER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL OR TWO OR THREE THAT ARE ON ONE WELL THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT MAY BE A CAMPGROUND OR MAYBE SOMETHING THAT HAS AN ACTUAL WATER DISTRICT THAT'S BEFORE US SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. N. AS THUNDERSTORMS. GIVEN A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IT JUST FOR ONE LAST FALL QUESTIONS ACTUALLY. RELATED BUT. THIS IS MORE ABOUT- LESS ABOUT SIGMA MORE BAD IMPLEMENTATION OF A- ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE ON A WATER YOU STUDY THAT I THINK PENDING WITH YOU ALL JUST- AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW BUT A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION WONDERING. STATUS THAT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WE JUST GET SOME INFO BACK ON THAT AT SOME POINT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT DAY. SO THAT IS- WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND- D. W. R. AND THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ARE DUE TO PRESENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN INDOOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS- AND- WE ARE- LOOKING TO DO THAT BY APRIL. I THINK. TO BE CANDID I THINK THE DEADLINE WAS- END OF LAST YEAR YOU NOT MEET THAT DEADLINE BUT IT IS A JOINT RECOMMENDATION AND- WE PLAN TO. HAVE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN APRIL- I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- WORK WITH YOUR STAFF SENATOR IF YOU WANT TO DRILL DOWN INTO MORE DETAILS. OKAY TOLD LOOK LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THAT'S A THAT'S GOOD. WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD ITEM NUMBER THIRTY TWO IN LESS BUT MOVED TO THE LAST ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY TWO WHICH IS THE SUBCOMMITTEE TWOS WILD FIRE PREVENTION RESILIENCY EARLY ACTION PLAN. I WOULD PRESENT ON THAT SWELTERING THE GAVEL OVER THERE- CENTER DOLLY TO ACT TO SECURE. WITH. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- CALIFORNIA'S RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SEVERE WILDFIRES IN RECORD HISTORY THEY'VE ONLY BEEN SOME BEER BUT HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMMUNITIES THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE STATE LESS VULNERABLE THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSES AN EARLY ACTION PLAN FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS OUTLINED IN. ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY TWO. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS MAKING A STRONG EFFORT TO ADDRESS WILDFIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IN A VARIETY OF VEGETATION TYPES NOT JUST FOR US. WE'RE LOOKING AT GRASSLANDS AND CHAPERONES FOR EXAMPLE STATE CONSERVANCY'S COVERED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF OUR STATE AND SERVICE A GOOD. CONDUIT FOR TARGETING A FUNDING IN SPECIFIC REGIONS. THIS PLAN INCLUDES OVER EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR OUR CONSERVANCY. THE DEPARTMENT OF- AKTION RECREATIONS MANAGES ONE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER HALF OF THAT ACREAGE. IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO WIRE FIRES THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDES TWENTY TWO MILLION TO CONDUCT ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE RISK IN OUR PARK LANDS. THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE WHICH WE TOOK HER FROM DOCTOR BOTTOM- EARLIER MANAGES OVER A MILLION ACRES. IT'S 90% OF WHICH IS IN REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS HIGH VERY HIGH OR EXTREME THREATS OF FIRE THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE LANDS SO WHY WE GIVE MONEY FOR CAL FIRE AND THEY DO THE BASELINE WORK THIS IS OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA DEDICATING. FUNDING FOR PROPOSED FUNDING TO DO MANAGEMENT. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. THE PEOPLE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THE NEED TO PROVIDE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ACT QUICKLY SO WE'RE ADDING FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR TWELVE A- P. WEISS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO HELP THEM GET THE JOB DONE. THIS WILL EXPEDITE THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND PERMITTING ON FIRE RELATED PROJECTS WHILE STILL PROTECTING THE SPECIES AND THEIR HABITATS. AVOID DELAYS THAT DEPARTMENTS MAY EXERCISE WITH DGS PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING PROCESSES WORK AT THIS PROPOSAL ADDS LANGUAGE THAT'S HACKED THAT HELPS DEPARTMENT. THIS QUICKLY IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE WILDLIFE- PREVENTION WORK BEFORE THAT THE NEXT FIRE SEASON AND THIS LANGUAGE IS BASED OFF OF A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHEN THE STATE WAS SUFFERING FROM DROUGHT SO WE'RE JUST RE PURPOSING IT SAYING. THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE DRAW CONCERNS WE HAVE. IN ADDITION. WE IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS BOTH WIRE FIRE AND DROUGHT RESILIENCY AND- THIS PLAN INCLUDES THIRTY NINE MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION'S. REGIONAL FORCE AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. AND OF THAT AMOUNT. WE'VE SET ASIDE SIXTEEN MILLION TOOK FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN THESE UPPER WATERSHEDS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT A SOURCE. OF WATER SUPPLY FOR THE STATE. OF MISTER CHAIR MISTER DALI WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS SITE IDEA THIS HIGH ALPINE WORTH WORTHY AT THE AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT NEEDS THAT HAVE WORK DONE. ALSO THE PLAN BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT TAKES CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE MOST IN NEED OF WILDFIRE. WERE MOST AFFECTED BY WHILE FOR FIRE EVENTS AND PROVIDES THIRTY TWO MILLION. EMERGENCY CLEAN AIR AND HYDRATION CENTERS AS WELL AS COOLING CENTERS WHAT WE DON'T I CAN'T PREDICT WHEN THE NEXT FIRES GET HIT OR THE DEGREE OR ANYBODY THAT MIGHT TESTIFY DISK WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO COME WE NEED TO BE PREPARED. THE SUBCOMMITTEE EARLY ACTION PLAN PROVIDES A STRONG BALANCE ADDRESSING A VARIETY OF NEEDS- WE'VE HAD THE INPUT FROM THE TERM EARLY ACTION I GUESS IS THAT WE'RE USING- AND THE FACT IS REALLY JUST PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF. AT THE END THE SESSION LAST YEAR. MY COLLEAGUE MAKES MCGUIRE CHEERS WITH MISS. CENTER RUBIO THE SENATE. WILDFIRE WORKING GROUP THAT'S BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE- SUBCOMMITTEE AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY SINCE THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN CENTER STERN SERVES ON THAT COMMITTEE- AND THEY'VE BEEN WORK FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEY'VE COME UP WITH HOW WE CAN DEFEND THE STATE AGAINST WILDFIRE. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID I POINT OUT MY COUNTERPART IN THE OTHER HOUSE THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM SEPTEMBER BLOOM IS THE AUTHOR OF AB. SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A THREE BILLION DOLLAR SIX TIMES AS LARGE AS HIS PROPOSAL FOR NUMEROUS NATURAL RESOURCES AND WIRE WILDFIRE RELATED PROJECTS. ALTHOUGH THE BILL WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL THEY SET A TEMPLATE THAT WE USE AT THE HALF. I HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR THIS THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED. THIS PLAN. IS HOW WE SEE THE EARLY ACTION OF WILDFIRE PACKAGES SHOULD BE. MORE WILLING AND EAGER TO ENGAGE OUR PARTNERS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE THE CITY CALIFORNIA SAFER. AND MORE RESILIENCE. TO WILDFIRES DOWN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU IS THE DIRECT THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR ALONG WITH THE BUDGET CHAIR AND THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMP TO ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE COUNTERPARTS IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THE SUBJECT OF AN EARLY ACTION WILDFIRE PLAN. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE PLANS OUTLINES IN THIS AGENDA. SHOULD SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR THE FOR MY NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS LISTED SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED THE CEILING THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF I'D LIKE TO REPEAT THIS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. IS TO APPROVE A THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES. THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR AND BEYOND. BUT NOTHING IN THIS MOTION IF IT'S IF IT'S APPROVED BY THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED BY TEN PARTY EARLY ACTION ON FIRE WILDFIRE ITEMS WILL NEGATE THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT. AND MEANINGFUL COMMITMENTS- AND RESOURCES TO CONTACT THE WILDFIRES FROM BEING. INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I WOULD NOTE I'M SURE EVERYBODY HAS TAKEN NOTICE IS THAT THERE IS NO MONEY FROM GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IN THIS EARLY ACTION PLAN IT'S ALL GENERAL FUNDS. WHICH WILL ALLOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH THE EXPENDITURES OF THE CAP AND TRADE FUNNIES MONIES AT A LATER TIME AND WITH THAT. RESEARCHER I WILL ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION AMONGST THE PANEL. DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR REMOVAL AREA. ALL RIGHT. WELL I WANT TO MAKE SURE I DON'T I CAN'T SEE IT. SENATOR STERN'S GUYS HAND UP SO IF HE DOES I NEED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A PHONE LINE HE DOES OKAY WE'LL GO TO. THE CENTER STORE AND THEN. I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR- GOING BIG AND LAYING OUT A VISION THAT- THAT IS. AT LEAST TRYING TO BE A PROPORTIONAL TO THE LEVEL OF URGENCY I THINK WE ALL FEEL IN. VARIOUS TYPES OF FIRE COUNTRY OUT THERE FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES DOWN TO. VERY URBAN INTERFACES- AND THIS ISN'T JUST COMMUNITIES IT'S ALL THE WORKING PEOPLE. OUT THERE WHO HAVE BEEN STRETCHED THIN AND MAYBE NOT EVEN GOT A BREAK. SINCE JULY YOU'RE AT ONE OF THESE FIRE CREWS- IT'S STRAINING ARE PEOPLE GONNA BREAK OUR FIRE FORCE UNLESS WE GO BIG- A LITTLE BREAKER TO MEANS LESS WE GO BIG SO I JUST. I APPRECIATE THAT OUR CHAIRS- VISION ON ALL THIS AND FRANKLY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S WELL FOR INITIATING THIS CONVERSATION AND PUTTING IT OUT THERE ALL IS. IS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES STARTED STEPPING UP AND TRY TO PUT THEIR FRAMEWORK FOR IT SO- JUST NEED ONE MORE ELEMENT TO THIS DEAL HOPEFULLY IN AND LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT COMES OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY BUT I THINK THAT. THERE OUGHT TO BE A VAST PAST YEAR FOR SOMETHING REALLY ROBUST AND- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS THAT IS- YOU KNOW SLOW MOVING IN. AND NOT URGENT AT THIS MOMENT I HAVE LOTS OF DETAILED FEEDBACK WHICH I DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY GET INTO TODAY BUT HOW TO IMPROVE- SAY ARE SUPPLEMENTED THE HARDENING PROPOSALS OR TO MAKE THE OPR PROPOSAL TALK BETTER TO THAT PROPOSAL OR TO INSURE SOME LINKAGES BETWEEN SAY ARE FSC. AND FOREST HEALTH AND SOME OF THE CONSERVANCY APPROPRIATIONS AND GET ALL THAT SEE THEM TALKING TO EACH OTHER BUT- AS WELL AS THE PARKING CDFW AND STATE LANDS COMMISSION PIECES TRYING TO. SORT OF SINK IT SO EVERYTHING IS SORT OF MOVING TOWARDS- SOME SIMILAR PRIORITIES AND WE CAN REALLY EXECUTE ON THIS STUFF AND MAKE IT CLEAR TO REAL PEOPLE WHAT ALL THIS MEANS BUT- SETTING ASIDE THOSE DETAILS FOR NOW- I JUST APPRECIATE. THE THE AMBITION OF THIS WHOLE THING SO. OURS ARE MY OTHER COMMENTS FOR USE THANK. YOU ROBERT FOR THE CENTER OF OUR- THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MR HERE- JUST TO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS NO NO QUESTIONS IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU IF YOU CARE. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AT YOUR Y. CASKEY. AT TERRA CASKEY OVER THE PAST MANY WEEKS HAD BEEN PUT IN HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS PROPOSAL. ALONG WITH MISS ROY WHO IS THE VERY CAPABLE CONSULTANT FIVE THIS COMMITTEE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU. FOR THE WORK THE TIME THE EFFORT. IN THIS IS TO BE HONEST THE BACK AND FORTH HI THAT IS TAKING US TO GET TO THIS DAY- OSKI HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT MANY OF THESE ISSUES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AS- THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES CHAIRPERSON. HE HAS BEEN RELENTLESS IN HIS PURSUIT. TO GO BOLD IN BIG. END THIS IS THE YEAR TO DO SO- AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK NO B. S. ON THAT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK TO BE DONE TO GET US TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY- UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS IN FRONT OF US. TO BE ABLE TO GET A THREE PARTY PROPOSAL- THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BOLDLY MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF- SUSAN RUBIO SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO WHO'S A- CO CHAIR OF THE- WILDFIRE WORKING GROUP. IN TO ALL THE MEMBERS. IN PARTICULAR SENATOR STERN WHO IS ALSO ON THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR HIS INCREDIBLE WORK. WHEN I SAY HANK YOU TO SENATOR DODD I CENTER ALAN SKINNER IN THE MOMENT- IS WELL IN THANK YOU TO AT THE CHAIR AGAIN. THAT FOR WORKING WITH US ON- TRACKING HOW THIS IS ALL IT IS HOW THIS ALL MATCHES WITH THE BLUEPRINT. SO AS THE- THE CARE IT SAID. A BLUEPRINT FOR A FIRE SAFE CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY OUR CAUCUS IT HAS FOUR MAIN PILLARS ONE TRAIN DEPLOY A FIRE RESILIENCY WORK FORCE. IMPLEMENT A MODERN DAY VEGETATION. FIRE FORCE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE HARDENING POINT EXPAND COMMUTER ACCESS. CONSUMER ACCESS TO THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET. IN DEVELOPED A SHORT AND LONG TERM FUNDING PLAN THAT WOULD. CULMINATE IN A BOND BEING ADVANCE A WILDFIRE AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND COMING UP IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO. KNOWING THAT FINES WOULD. B. ADVANCING TWO FOUR ME THAT WE NEED BE ADDED TO. A YEAR. TO TACKLE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT IS FACING THE STATE BEHIND THE PANDEMIC. THAT'S WILD AND FIRES. THE LIVELIHOODS LITERALLY OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK. IN WHAT WE KNOW IS THE SIZE AND SCOPE WHILE THEN FIRES ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE. THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF THE FIRES OF ALL HAPPENED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT'S EXPEDITED. LAST YEAR WITH THE FOUR MILLION ACRES AS FAR AS YOUR DOLLY HAS ELOQUENTLY STATED SO MANY TIMES. FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMISSIONS OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION VEHICLES. YES WE CONTINUE. TO THROW PENNIES AT THIS CHALLENGE I WILL FIRST SAY. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS EXPEDITED FIRE RESOURCES MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND WE NEED TO THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP TRULY. BUT HE ALSO SHOWS UP WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT AT ANY HAZARDOUS OFF ONTO THE RIGHT PATH. AND WE NEED TO GO BIGGER AND BOLDER. CAL FIRE IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF A FIRE FIGHTING FORCE IN THE STATION CANDIDLY IN THE WORLD. YET THEY'RE OVERWHELMED. THEY'RE EXHAUSTED. AND ARE UNDER RESOURCED. REPEATING HOW FAR STAFFING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BEFORE I WAS BORN. YET WE'RE BRINGING MORE ACRES IN ONE YEAR THAN WE DID BYE IN HALF A DECADE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. WE HAVE TO START FOCUSING ON WHAT IS RIGHT AND CANDIDLY IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT GO BIG AND BOLD. OTHERWISE IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY- IF IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AS IT IS AND WE CAN'T KEEP THAT GOING I TRY TO POINT OUT SOME ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE. ADVANCED FOR THE FIRST AND FOREMOST- WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT IN WHERE MY CASKEY IS GOING. HE IS PUTTING IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS EARLY ACTION IN FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS THESE DOLLARS WOULD BE ADVANCED. BACK TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES FIRE DISTRICTS CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO DESPERATELY NEED THESE DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD BE IN CUMBERLAND PRIOR TO THAT SUMMER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HE'S BEEN FOCUSED ON. HE'S TRIPLING THE NUMBER- FOR THE C. PARTS IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT WAS ORIGINALLY REQUESTED FOR EARLY ACTION GOING TO FORTY NINE MILLION TO BEER TO GET THOSE DEPLOYED. IN THOSE LANDS THAT ARE BORDERING COMMUNITIES- HE WERE FOCUSING ON GETTING HAND CREWS OUT EARLIER ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE WHO REPRESENTS THAT CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS SHOULD TAKE SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET A SEASONAL FIREFIGHTER ONBOARDED IN OUT ON THE LAND. IF WE WAIT TILL JUNE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET A PORTION OF THESE CREWS OUT EARLY TO BE ABLE TO START FIGHTING FIRES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DO IN ADDITION BUT WHICH ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR. IS THAT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN CASKEY HE'S DOUBLING THE DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY HARDENING ACROSS THE STATE W. WE'VE NEVER SEEN FORTY NINE MILLION ADVANCE OUR COMMUNITY HARDENING. WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO BIGGER- AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT- CANDIDLY WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL BAND WITHIN THE AGENCY TO GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT BUT HE'S DOUBLING WHAT WAS YOUR REGION INVESTED LAST. PIECE ON THIS DAY IN WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE. INCREASE THE COW FIRE. SO THERE'S THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN THIS PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CAL FIRE CREWS- THAT WOULD BE HIRED EARLY. ON AND JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS WE HEARD FROM CAL FIRE THEMSELVES. MAJORITY THEIR WORKERS DOING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN ADDITION TO- FOCUSING ON HAND CREWS. ARE IN THEIR DUTIES THERE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE GET THEM HIRED. I THINK THIS IS. A PROPOSAL THAT WE SHOULD ADOPT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU TO SENATOR STERN CENTER DOLLY. IN CENTER RUBIO- OUT FOR A MOVIE THIS WORK. NO I HAVEN'T WEIGHED IN YET BUT DID YOU HAVE A SOMETHING OPENED AND I WAS JUST GONNA SAY- THE- CINEMA. POINTS OUT THERE'S- A DECADE OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THIS IS HERE ONE. THIS IS I MEAN THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR THE FIRST YEAR IT'S A TEMPLATE. WELL HOPEFULLY THAT. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING IF WE DO IF. YOU HAVE A BOND THERE'S A- A FILLER OF TWO OR THREE YEARS WE HAVE TO. WORK WITH SUCH AS UNDERSCORE THAT. SO I'M GONNA MAKE MY COMMENTS AND I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO- FINANCE AND NOT TO RESOURCES IN LA- IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AS WELL. SO FIRST OFF I WANT TO DO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE A- CENTER WHITE CASKET WORKE. HE CALLED ME ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. AND I WAS REACHING OUT TO ME TO. SEE WHAT MY THOUGHTS WERE ON. THIS PROCESS AND BEING- I GUESS A FRESHMAN ON THIS COMMITTEE- AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN. MY TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT I DID NOTICE SOME JUST JACKIE RIGHT NOW I NOTICED ON WHERE THERE'S THIRTY NINE MILLION WAS. IN SIXTEEN MILLION FOR THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN THE UPPER WATERSHEDS WITH EMPHASIS ON WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY COMBO OF TREATMENT STRATEGIES WELL MONITORING SYSTEMS CAPTURED IT IT THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM THAT PARAGRAPH. ON THESE PROJECTS ARE IN THE NORTH COAST SOUTHERN SIERRA SAMBAR NINO NATIONAL FOREST IN THE CENTRAL COAST WHICH EXCLUDES THE NORTHERN. PART OF THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE WHICH 60% OF OUR WATER COMES FROM SO I WAS WONDERING- HOW THAT MONEY WHY WOULD NOT BE DISTRIBUTED AS WELL TO- THAT NORTHERN SIERRA'S. IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT ON MY PART BY MY PART BUT THAT WAS NOT TO IT WAS NOT TO EXCLUDE THEM AT ALL THIS IS JUST WHERE THE NEED IS WE UNDERSTAND. THAT THESE UPPER WATERSHEDS IS WHERE THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE SO THAT THANK YOU FOR SPOTTING THAT AND- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WOULD BE CORRECT OKAY. AND THEN THE OTHER THING I DO IS I JUST HAVE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS I WANT TO MAKE THAT- SENATOR MCGUIRE. ALLUDED TO NIGHT AND I WILL NOT. GIVE UP ON THIS- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. IN OUR QUEST FOR- FIXING THE ALMOST A HUNDRED YEAR PROBLEM WE CREATED THE- IN THE END I WILL SAY NOT ALL IN THE GRASSLANDS AND SOME OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BUT IN THE UPPER WATERSHEDS- SUPPRESSING FIRE. WHICH NATURALLY OCCURRED WAS WRONG AND THAT WAS DONE BY US- WE DIDN'T ALLOW FIRE TO DO. WHAT IT ACTUALLY DIDWHICH WAS BURNED AND TAKE OUT THE UNDERBRUSH AND SO. AS A AS MANY MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND MANY IN THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR- DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I AND I. MENTIONED EARLIER IN OUR LAST SET TO ABOUT. MY FRUSTRATION WITH NOT COUNTING CARBON- IN WILDFIRE AND I GOT A RESPONSE BACK ACTUALLY- MY STAFF ON A RESPONSE FROM THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD. WHICH WAS FOR FIVE PAGES OF YOU KNOW THE CARBON CYCLE AND HOW IT WORKS IN THE WATERSHED I ALREADY UNDERSTAND THAT CARBON CYCLE AND THAT WHAT THEIR QUALIFYING IS WORKING LANDSCAPES AND- SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE REASON I PUSHED REALLY HARD FOR. US TO. FORCE THE AIR BOARD TO QUANTIFY THE CARBON OUTPUT FROM FIRE IS BECAUSE 60% OF THE LAND IN CALIFORNIA IS MANAGED BY OUR FEDERAL PARTNER. THEY'RE NOT AT THE TABLE I'M SORRY THEY THEY HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS IF MANY WERE AWARE OF. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE. A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO WILDFIRE WE'RE FRONTING THE BILL QUITE FRANKLY. ON OUR ECONOMY. TO REDUCE CARBON IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S THROUGH MAINLY TRANSPORTATION AND LOT OF REGULATION ON OUR BUSINESS IS. WHICH I HAVE SOME ISSUE WITH ON LOT OF THOSE ISSUES ON HOW WE GET WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DIDN'T GET INTO. THIS PROBLEM OVERNIGHT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF IT OVERNIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS A HUNDRED YOUR PROBLEM. THAT WE STARTED SO. I WANT TO ADD HOW DID WE SAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE WERE IF WE WERE TO CARRY OUT THE CARBON. AND WE COULD TARGET WHERE IT COMES FROM. FROM FOREST FIRE. WE COULD THEN GO TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND SAY HEY YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH US. BECAUSE ALL THE GAMES THAT WERE MAKING. ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE IS BEING EIGHT UP BY OUR RELEASES ON THE- ON THE FOREST FIRE SIDE. AND THE CARCINOGENS THAT ARE PUT OUT IN THESE FIRES ARE NOT JUST WOULD SMOKE IT'S ONE WEEK HOW MANY HOMES WERE BURNED UP AND HOW MUCH. CARCINOGENS WERE PUT OUT IN THOSE TYPES IT IS A SITUATION SO WE NEED TO QUANTIFY THAT AND WE NEED THE AIR BOARD TO DO IT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR TO THE SENATORS AND THE PUBLIC THAT ARE WATCHING THIS THAT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE DON'T DO THAT AND WE DON'T HOLD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE THEY PARTICIPATED IN. FIRE SUPPRESSION AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA DID. AND THEY NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE AND THEY NEED TO BRING THE RESOURCES. TO FICTION ON A WATERSHED APPROACH. SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION TO IS THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE NEED N. SEQUESTERING CARBON THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN USING. WE HAVE. A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND NONE OF THESE NONE OF THAT NOT VERY MUCH OF THIS. ALL OF OUR OF OUR BUDGETING PROCESS GOES TO. FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN INCENTIVIZE. PRIVATE INVESTORS TO COME ALONG SIDE US AND HELP REDUCE THE COST REMEMBER IF YOU'RE TAKING. A PRODUCT OUT OF THE FOREST IT'S USABLE IT'S THERE'S A VALUE TO THAT IN IN IN NOT VALUE REDUCES THE COST WE CAN TREAT MORE ACRES RIGHT NOW WE HAVE IS BIG TIME COSTS GOING INTO. THE MOUNT OF TREATMENT SO I JUST WANT TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. TO REITERATE MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M TRYING TO HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE BY DOING LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF GIVE YOU A LONG TERM PLAN I MET WITH- CHIEF PORTER- YESTERDAY TALKED TO HIM QUITE A BIT ABOUT THIS PLAN AND LOOK SO IT'S A TWO FOLD. OPERATION NUMBER ONE. IS DOING WHAT CENTER REQUIRES BEEN ADVOCATING FOR TO GIVE US THE MATURE THE QUICKNESS AND THE MANPOWER. TO PUT OUT THE FIRE THAT'S BURNING IMMEDIATELY. THE OTHER HALF OF THAT IS DOING. THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN THE FOREST AND IN THE GRASSLANDS. AND WE ARE WE NEED OUR PARTNERS WHICH IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE AT THE TABLE SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS MR CHAIRMAN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE AS PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I DON'T THINK WE SPEND ENOUGH RESOURCES ON THE SECOND HALF OF IT REDUCING THE VEGETATION. AND FORCING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME TO THE TABLE SO WITH THAT I GUESS RIGHT NOW WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR YEAH FINALLY- FINANCE OR NOT TO RESOURCES IF YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT YEAH I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID I THINK PART OF THE WORK HERE BEFORE YOU ARRIVE WE'VE- WE'VE INVESTED IN WORKING LANDS IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN. THE SOMETHING PART OF THE- BUDGET FINAL RESOLUTION BUT WE'VE BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT ON THE SECOND HALF OF THE EQUATION THAT YOU HAVE THE OTHER. FIFTY SIX HE SAID IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE OVER A TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCIENCE BASED- WORKING WE'RE GIVING CAL FIRED A ECOLOGICAL MONITORING RESEARCH AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TO DO THAT THE AIRPORT IS GETTING. A MILLION BUCKS FOR PERMIT EFFICIENCIES THAT WE THINK THAT WE CAN WITH THEY CAN HELP US WITH THAT AND THEN. THE RESOURCE AGENCIES GOING TO GET THIS FOR MOST CENSORING WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM SOME MORE MONEY SO THAT WE CAN. WE USE TECHNOLOGY AS PART AND BASICALLY YOU SEE IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE- THE- THE CAL FIRE IF THEY DO SOME. MODELING AND A DEFINITE HAS BEEN WORK SO% WE- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S SOME WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE THAT DOESN'T- PRODUCED IMMEDIATE RESULTS BUT IS KEEP MAKING US BETTER PREPARE SO MAYBE THEY- THE AGENCIES WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE. PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT ALSO. SO. JESSICA. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PROPOSAL IN JUST MORE STEPHANIE SECRETARY FOR A FOREST RESOURCES AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND- WE ARE EAGER AND EXCITED TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON- ON EARLY ACTION FUNDING AND ONE EMPHASIZED HOW IMPORTANT A SPEED OF EARLY ACTION FUNDING IS THERE A LIMITED WINDOWS WHERE WE CAN DO REAL WORK ON THE GROUND FOR FIRE PREVENTION GIVEN WEATHER CONSTRAINTS AND SO AND WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THOSE WINDOWS RIGHT NOW AND SO TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE- PROJECTS GOING- TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER HIGHER RESILIENCE SOONER. WE NEED TO GET STARTED AND- QUICKLY- I ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT- WE ARE EXCITED TO REALLY- PARTNER WITH YOU ON AND ON THE DETAILS OF THIS AND- AND GET INTO SOME OF THE NEW ONES- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT REGIONAL APPROACH- YOU ARE A BUYER STRATEGY THE WAY THIS WAS DESIGNED- AND I THINK THIS IS ECHOED IN YOUR PROPOSAL IS THAT- IS THAT WE WOULD CHANGE PROGRAMS LIKE THE REGIONAL FORCES FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM AND THEY WOULD HELP DESIGN REGIONAL STRATEGIES WE GIVE THEM- TOOLS COALITION AND STATE THAT THEY WOULD INTEGRATE THE DATA INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING. TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN COHESIVE REGIONAL STRATEGIES AND THEN OUR PROJECT AHLERS FROM GRANT PROGRAMS WOULD THEN BE MORE- INTEGRATED I THREW INTO THOSE REGIONAL STRATEGIES AND CONSTANT REGIONAL FIRE FORCING FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM SO I HOPE THAT YOU'RE REALLY SEEING SORT OF THAT PARADIGM SHIFT ON THE REGIONAL APPROACH HERE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS BUT JUST EXCITED TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS AND- REALLY WOULD URGE US SPEED. IN GETTING THESE TOWERS ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU- FINANCE. HI STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ECHOING- MISS MORRIS COMMENTS ISSUE PRECIADO REALLY SEEING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S PROPOSAL IN THE DETAILS OF YOUR HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO- SEE THE COMMITTEE'S PRIORITIES AS WE CAN GAUGE THE CONVERSATION GOING FORWARDS WE APPRECIATE THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL. JUST A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS WE HAD- INITIALLY IS- IT'LL BE HELPFUL SAID AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION TO SEE- HOW- THE COMMITTEE'S EARLY ACTION REPORT. AND LAY OUT WITH WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT DOING IN THE BUDGET YEAR- YEAH JUST THINKING THAT LIKE OUR OVERALL PACKAGE HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REALLY ACTION AND SOME BUDGET YEAR. FUNDING AND THEN JUST TRYING TO SEE SOME OF THESE ARE ARE CLEARLY. OVERALL INCREASES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SPENDING THAT- BE HELPFUL JUST TO SEE WHETHER SOME OF THE OTHERS DARK CELEBRATION SO SHIFTING FUNDING FROM BUDGIE OR INTO EARLY ACTION HERE. IS KIND OF HOW WE LAY ON THE BUDGET YEARS WELLS WE CAN KIND OF COMPARE OVERALL PACKAGE THAT. IS SUPER HELPFUL FOR STARTING THAT. CONVERSATION AND IT IS THE OTHER THOUGHT BEING THAT- SO WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER REALLY ACTION OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS. WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT WAS- THE CAPACITY THAT DEPARTMENTS HAD WE'RE DELIVERING WITHIN THE TIME FRAME- UP EARLY ACTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF FISCAL YEAR SO. AS WE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONAL JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE LOOKING AT THE PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CAPACITY TO DELIVER. YOU KNOW KIND OF A HIGHER LEVEL WITHIN THAT SAME SHORTEN TIME FRAME SO. I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO IN THIS KIND. AND INTO- THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC IS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE. DEEP IN VERY IMPORTANT ADMINISTRATION- THE GOVERNORS WANTED TO DO BIG THINGS WE'VE MADE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THIS SPACE EVERY YEAR- MAKE IT AGAIN TRY TO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT DOING SOME MORE. IN EARLY ACTION AS WELL AS ANYBODY HERE IN THE SPACE- CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT AND RECOGNIZE ALL THE- HE SAYS THAT THE ABILITY GOT FIVE NUMBERS HERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU- THEN ALSO L. A. L. THANK YOU MR CHAIR GENERATES A LIST WITH THE LA- WE DON'T COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC PACKAGE BUT JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE ARE HERE AS YOUR STAFF TO SUPPORT YOU AS YOU WORK THROUGH THESE DISCUSSIONS AND PLEASE JUST LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN BE HELPFUL. AS NEGOTIATIONS PROCEED. THANK YOU. I JUST HAD ONE LAST COMMENT TO THAT- I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW WE DID SP NINE A ONE. WHICH WAS BASICALLY- CONTINUES APPROPRIATION WHEN WE DID THAT BILL WE CONTINUE TO PROBATE AND I KNOW THAT THAT THIS IS VERY ACTIONS GENERAL FUND. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE CLEAR THAT THE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE. CONCERNED ABOUT HAS BEEN ON A ONE THAT WILL COME IN THE LATER. BUDGET AND THOSE FUNDS WILL COME OUT OF G. G. R. F. ACTUALLY- TO. DO THE PROGRAMS SO WITH THAT- NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NOW. AND BACK TO THE BIKE. THIS CALL CENTER START SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE YOUR HAND UP SORRY. DON'T SWEAT IT- WHEN YOU TAKE MY HAND DOWN HERE- WELL THAT IS SECOND DID I JUST QUIT MY SCREEN AFTER MY GOOD YEAR HERE WE SEE YOU OKAY- JUST ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION- ON- SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE JUST HEARD. I THINK WE'RE THERE'S A THERE'S A BURGEONING FOR SPEED WHICH I REALLY DO APPRECIATE AND- THERE WAS A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE . F. F. C. PROGRAM- THE PLANS THAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH FROM DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND FROM SOME OF THE DESIGNATED AGENCIES UNDER THAT PROGRAM SHOW THAT- THE- TOTAL. POTENTIAL SIZE OF YOU KNOW SIR PROJECT SIZE OF MONEY WE COULD GET OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY- IS ACTUALLY MUCH BIGGER MY SENSE THEN THEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN HERE DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT. EVEN WITH THE ROBUST- PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE GOT HERE THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T MET THE THEY NEED AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF- EVERY SECRETARY FOR SURE COMMENTED MR BENSON I'M NOT SURE- BUT LIKE JUST TO TRY TO GET A SENSE OF. IT FEELS BIG FEELS BOLD RIGHT BUT- I MEAN I'VE SEEN JUST ADAM- THE SOME OF THE CONSERVANCY'S FOR INSTANCE IN OUR BACKYARD WHO AFTERWARD THE DESIGNEES UNDER THE R. FIFTY PROGRAM. EASILY COULD SPEND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS ALONE THIS YEAR I MEAN THAT CENTER DOLLY TALKED ABOUT. IN THE NORTHERN SIERRAS I MEAN THEY COULD SPEND THE SAME I THINK IN A IN A HEART BEAT I MEAN SO DO YOU. IS THERE SOME OME WAY TO. TO GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW TO HOW TO. HOW HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO KEEP BEGINNING TO RESULT IN HERE I KNOW I. PRESSED ON IT THE LAST HEARING SORT OF TRYING TO. GET A QUANTIFIED VERSION OF THAT BUT- DID YOU IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT FROM A DIRECTIONAL SENSE DO YOU WOULD YOU SAY IT'S FAIR TO ASSUME THAT. EVEN WITH THIS INVESTMENT WE'RE STILL NOT MEETING THE FULL THROUGHPUT CAPACITY OF WHAT SOME OF THESE. AGENCIES COULD DO SECRETARY MORE STORE CASH EITHER ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN I'M HAPPY TO GET INTO THAT- EVEN THIS IS A MULTI GENERATIONAL CRISIS I THINK EVERYONE'S REALLY AWARE OF THAT AND YOU CAN'T- I'M TANGLE IN IN THREE MONTHS. AND SO AND IT DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO A BUDGET CYCLE SO WHEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT SORT OF EARLY ACTION PERSON IS LONGER TERM FUNDING- WE WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS CAN YOU. PUT ON THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY GET THE BALL ROLLING AND GAIN A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE BY GETTING THOSE FUNDS- THREE TO FIVE MONTHS EARLY- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THOSE FUNDS IN MARCH VERSUS JUNE. AND SO THAT'S HOW WE HAD DESIGNED IT- AND SO THE ONLY THING WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE. AND SHIFTING IT POTENTIALLY MORE FUNDING INTO AN EARLIER APPROPRIATION. IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS- IN THIS HEARING WHICH IS A HYBRID APPROACH TO ONE TIME FUNDING WE- BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A NEW ONE IN DEAN. YOUR DOLLARS- FOR THESE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY FOR CONSERVANCIES IN STATE PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY REALLY TAKE PROGRAMS START TO FINISH. AND SO WE HAVE PROPOSED A FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR EXPENDITURE LIGHTS. WERE A LOT OF THESE DOLLARS WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO HIRE STAFF UNLIMITED TERMS AND REALLY A VOID SORT OF THE START AND STOP- CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THIS FUNDING I'M THE OTHER THING THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO GET MORE TO THIS REGIONAL. FUNDING I THINK WE'RE GETTING TO THE SAME VISION THERE'S A HUGE APPETITE AROUND REGIONS WITH SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WE ARE EAGER TO FIND OUR VISION WAS TO HAVE THE REGIONAL QUESTION BY OUR CAPACITY PROGRAMS HELPED- BUILD UP REGIONS THAT YOU DESIGNED FOR STRATEGIES. AND AND HAVE R. FORCE GRANT AND OTHER FLEXIBLE GRANT DOLLARS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET. PROPOSAL WRIT LARGE YEAH A LOT OF ITS GRANT FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- CLIMATE CATALYST MY METER FOR SMALL. LANDING AND OF COURSE HOW AND FIRE. GRANT DOLLARS WHICH ARE VERY. THE GOAL IS TO THEM HOW DOES. INTO EXECUTING THE- FOR. SO WHETHER YOU I THINK I HAD. WE CAN HAVE WITH YOUR STAY IS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH ON. FUNDING CAN USED. OR I'M TWENTY THREE REGIONAL STRATEGIES OR OR OR BOTH I THINK THE GOAL IS TO GET THE FUNDING SHOULD BE TARGETED. TO THE REGIONS AND BRING THE FULL FORCE- OF THE STRATEGY HERE IN PLACE. AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY EMPHASIZES THAT NEED STRATEGY WE HAVE PROPOSED WITH THIS BUDGET- ALL OF THE PROGRAMS REINFORCE ONE ANOTHER. AND THEY ARE DESIGNED TO BE HELD UP AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE CAN HAVE. ON GOING HERE IS REALLY I'M SURE THAT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS GO FORWARD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO REMOVE THE BRICKS FROM THE ARCH- AND WE WANT THIS TO GO FORWARD IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ONLY WENT BUST AND FAST. DATABLE TO REALLY DELIVER THAT LONG TERM. GOAL OF RESILIENCE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THANKS FOR THE AND YOU KNOW I WOULD ADD I THINK THIS THE SAME HYBRID. COULD BE MADE ON A HARDENING SUPPLEMENT AS WELL. THAT THAT. I HOPE GOING FORWARD THATWILL WILL ADHERE TO THAT PRINCIPLE THAT. THEN HAVING CAPACITY BUILDING INTO EARLY ACTION MONEY IS A TYPE OF SHOVEL READY PROJECTS RIGHT BY INVESTING IN PEOPLE AND THAT SORT OF CAPACITY AND GIVING IT THE PROPER INCOME BRING CYCLE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT INTO THAT HELP SAVE A COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE ACTUALLY BUILD THEIR HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN FOR INSTANCE TO TAKE HARDENING INTO ACCOUNT. AT PRIVATE HOMES NOT JUST ON PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SORT OF CRISIS TO CRISIS YOU KNOW- THE SAME GOES FOR SOME OF THESE LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES YOU TALKED ABOUT- THIS IS SO AND- THE CHASING OF THE GRANT CYCLE I DO WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. IF IT'S JUST STRUCTURED IN THOSE SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS WE DON'T GET LONG TERM INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY MISSION ALIGNMENT AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I REALLYAPPRECIATE YOU BRINGING. THAT POINT UP- AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER THAT GOING FORWARD AND TO AND TO THAT END I THINK. THERE'S WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BUT THERE MAY BE I MAY. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR I MAY MAKE A MOTION FOR SOME CLARIFICATION AROUND. ADD SOME PARITY ON SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS BUT- I THINK THAT'S FOR LATER. IS THAT THAT'S FOR LATER IN THIS HEARING PROCESS. YEAH AFTER WE HAVE THE PUBLIC COMMENT HERE OKAY. GREAT I ALWAYS ARE THERE FOR LATER THANK YOU SO MUCH.
