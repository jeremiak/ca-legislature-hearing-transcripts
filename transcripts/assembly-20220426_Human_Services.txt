CENTER YOU'RE THE LUCKY ONE GOING FIRST TELLS THAT. WHERE DO SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY ONCE WE GET A QUORUM THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOU MADAM CHAIR- AB TWENTY THREE OH NINE STRENGTHENS EXISTING JUVENILE COURT PROCEDURES TO ORDER GUARDIANSHIP INSTEAD OF FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. THE EARLY STAGES OF A DEPENDENCY COURT CASE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AFTER A CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THEIR PARENTS CARE ARE CRITICAL THESE EARLY COURT HEARINGS TO DETERMINE WHERE A CHILD WILL LIVE AND WHAT SERVICES THE FAMILY WILL RECEIVE FOR THE MONTHS AND SOMETIMES FOR THE YEARS TO COME. IT'S ALSO AT THIS EARLY STAGE THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION OF FAMILIES OF COLOR IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM MANIFESTS. JUVENILE COURTS HAVE DISCRETION UNDER WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS. CODE SECTIONS TO ORDER A SAFE AND PERMANENT PLAN OF GUARDIANSHIP AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. THIS OPTION TYPICALLY ARISES UNDER CERTAIN FACT PATTERNS NAMELY WHAT APPARENT TO CLIENTS OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THEIR ATTORNEY AND IDENTIFIES A FAMILY MEMBER OR OTHER KNOWN ADULT TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILD THAT THE CHILD IS STILL WITHIN THE REALM OF THEIR FAMILY. CALIFORNIA COURT TO DESCRIBE THIS OPTION IS ONE OF THE LAST OPPORTUNITIES. TO GIVE SOME DEFERENCE TO THE PARENTS OWN PLAN FOR THEIR CHILD AND I WOULD SAY ALSO TO ALSO- MANY TIMES OFFER THAT CHILD SOME LINK TO. SIBLINGS TO COUSINS TO OTHER MEMBERS AND THEY'RE KNOWN UNIVERSE. BUT JUVENILE COURT STAKEHOLDERS REPORT THAT GUARDIANSHIP IN LIEU OF FOSTER CARE ARE NOT USUALLY CONSIDERED EVEN WITH THAT OPTION WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND THE FAMILY. COURTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE PARENTS CHOICE OF GUARDIAN AND TYPICALLY DO NOT CONSIDER GUARDIANSHIP. UNTIL THE DISPOSAL HEARING AFTER THE CHILD HAS BEEN DETAINED IN FOSTER CARE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WHICH OF COURSE CAN BE TRAUMATIZING FOR THE CHILD. AB TWENTY THREE OH NINE TO PROMOTE FAMILY DECISION MAKING AND MINIMIZE A CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. ONLY WHEN THERE'S A SAFE AND PERMANENT GUARDIAN AVAILABLE AND THAT WOULD BE UP THE COURT'S DISCRETION TO DECIDE THAT APPROPRIATENESS. THE BILL UPDATES THE LAW BY ALLOWING THE JUVENILE COURT TO ORDER ORDER ORDER GUARDIANSHIP EARLIER THE DEPENDENCY COURT PROCESS. AND REQUIRING THE JUVENILE COURT TO SELECT PARENTS AS ADMITTED GUARDIAN AS LONG AS THE CHILD SAFETY IS NOT JEOPARDIZED. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DSS TO COLLECT DATA ON CHILDREN LIVING WITH A RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BECOME GUARDIANS UNDER THIS BILL. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS OF AS WE REFINE THE BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. SAMANTHA FOR WITH THE ALLIANCE ON CHILDREN'S RIGHTS WILL BE OUR PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT AND SHE IS WITH US BY PHONE. GREAT GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON THAT AND SHARING THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS THAT THE CODE BONTA THAT SPELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE THE CARE GIVERS THE LION FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS HAS SPENT THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HOSTING FOCUS GROUPS SURVEYS AND CONVENIENCE ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE KINSHIP CAREGIVERS RELATIVES WHO STEP UP TO CARE FOR CHILDREN AFTER THOSE CHILDREN ARE SEPARATED BY THEIR PARENTS BY THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. WE GATHER DATA FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SHOWING THAT ALTHOUGH THE CARE GIVERS AND THE CHILDREN THEY CARE FOR HAVE SIMILAR GENETIC EXPERIENCES AND COMPLEX NEEDS BUT THE VISION MADE EARLY IN THE FAMILY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH CHILD WELFARE. CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES. ASSEMBLY DEPORTED REPORT A RANGE OF. AND WHETHER PARENTS AND SHALL. ACCESS TO A- WHETHER TO CARE. MORGAN BOOK HEARING THE CHILL AND OTHER FAMILY LIKE HAD A TIME IN THE BACKED ARRANGEMENT FOR THAT. AB TWENTY OH NINE COMES OUT OF THESE COME. IN ATTEMPTS IDENTIFY THE IMPORTANT JUNCTURES AN EXISTING LEGAL PROCESSES WHERE ONE OR MORE OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS ARE MISSING. A LOT OF THE LAST WORK TO ORDER INCIDENT THE LAW CAN BE STRENGTHENED TO ENSURE A FAMILY PLAN MORE OF A DECISION MAKING ROLE AND THE FACT THAT. IT'S SO BAD THAT BY GIVING THE JUVENILE COURT FLEXIBILITY SUPPORTER GUARDIANSHIP MORE QUICKLY THAN A LOT UNDER CURRENT LAW REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE PARENTS IN THE NATION OF GUARDIAN AS LONG AS THE CHILD HEALTH AND SAFETY. ARE NOT JEOPARDIZED. I WANT TO KNOW THE BILL ALSO WORK. THAT THE OF THOSE SERVICES TO CALL DATA ON THE FERRY CARE GIVER X. THAT. THE ALLIANCE HAS BEEN. OF THE PATH OF YEARS WITH THE GOAL OF FOR. A MORE. WITH PART THAT FOR ALL. THANK YOU AND WE RESPECTFULLY. THAT BY THE- THANK YOU. DO HAVE ANOTHER WOULD.

ABSOLUTELY OKAY. THAT I GOT A LOT OF. RELATED. ALL OF. COMING OUT. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WE'LL START WITH THEM AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE. EIGHTEEN SIXTY WILL OPINI SORRY. OTHER BECAUSE SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU OTHER THREE OKAY YEAH. A TRIPLE HEADER THERE OKAY I TRY TO BE EFFICIENT- THEY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE TEAM- AND STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK A TO HELP GET US READY. ALSO SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. BUT TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX A BILL THAT WOULD CLARIFY REFERRAL CRITERIA CONCERNING DEPENDENT CHILDREN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. THERE'S A WIDE AGREEMENT WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE COMMITTEE AT THE BEST THING FOR MOST CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES. HOWEVER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR CONGRESS AGAIN MAKING STATES RECOUP THE COSTS OF FOSTER CARE FROM PARENTS OF FOSTER YOUTH. A CONTRADICTORY PRACTICE THAT GOES AGAINST THE STATED GOAL OF FOSTER CARE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY FAMILY REUNIFICATION. CALIFORNIA DATA SHOWS THAT MANY PARENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THESE EXPENSES EXT EXPERIENCE EXTREME POVERTY. THE PRACTICE IS WRONG ON MANY LEVELS. HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CHILDREN STAYING CARE CHILDREN REMAINING CARAMEL SEVEN MONTHS LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY. WE SAY THAT WE SUPPORT FAMILY REUNIFICATION BUT OUR CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT HARDER FOR FAMILIES TO DO JUST THAT. REUNIFY WE SAY WE BELIEVE IN EQUITY IN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. RACIAL DISPROPORTIONATELY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BUT THE IMPACTS OF MAKING PARENTS PAY FOR FOSTER CARE FALLS ESPECIALLY. AND MOST ACUTELY ON BLACK FAMILIES IN INCREASES BLACK CHILDREN'S LENGTH OF STAY EVEN LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE SIX PLUS MONTHS. A. B. SIXTEEN A SIX REQUIRES CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO PRESUME THAT PAYMENT OF FOSTER CARE COSTS UNNECESSARILY EXTENDS CHILDREN'S TIME IN FOSTER CARE. WHICH IN MOST CASES THE DEATH AND AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CHILDREN THIS POLICY CARE CLARIFICATION WILL ENSURE THAT DECISIONS ABOUT REFERRALS ARE MADE MORE UNIFORM ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHICH WILL REDUCE. THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE CHILD STAY IN CARE. BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS. PARENTS SEEKING TO BE REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE PARENTS YOU CAN BE RELY REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO USE THEIR INCOME TO REESTABLISH THEIR HOMES AND BUILD A THRIVING AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT NOT PAY BACK THE COUNTY FOR THE TIME THE CHILDREN. THE CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN WERE IN FOSTER CARE. TO GIVE TESTIMONY TODAY I'M JOINED BY SABRINA FORTY. A DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND IMPACT LITIGATION ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND PAULA- THE LAST VELASQUEZ DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AGASSI FOR CW D. A. TO TESTIFY. SOME OF SUPPORTIVE ON THE FARM AND I'M HERE IN PERSON I'M HAPPY TO GET US KICKED OFF OR DO YOU WANT TO START WITH THIS FORTY ON THE PHONE NO PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. OKAY AFTERNOON JAN MEMBERS PAULA VAZQUEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE AUTHOR NOTED THIS BELT CLARIFIES PAYMENT REFERRAL CRITERIA. FOR PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN ARE PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE TOP CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM CAN. BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO. MAKE A REFERRAL FOR CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONS IN CERTAIN INSTANCES. WHERE COLLECTION OF NOT A BARRIER TO REUNIFICATION FOR CHILDREN. THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. CWD A CO SPONSORED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO A LAW THAT REDUCE REFERRALS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT A CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT MUST PRESUME THAT PAYMENTS PAYMENT OF SUPPORT BY THE PARENT IS LIKELY TO POSE A BARRIER TO REUNIFICATION. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH RESEARCH FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED PARENTS PAY THEIR CHILD'S DURATION AND KERR LENGTHENS FOR SIX POINT SIX MONTHS. THE EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR WHO ARE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. FAMILIES WHO ARE SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC SYSTEMS ARE BETTER ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT IN ORDER TO REUNIFY REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. CONVERSELY ENFORCING PAYMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT. BY PARENTS WHO ARE FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING GENERALLY SERVE TO MAKE REUNIFICATION WITH THEIR CHILDREN HARDER TO ACHIEVE AND CAN FURTHER DESTABILIZE THE FAMILY. THIS CHANGE EFFECTIVELY NARROW THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD ALLOW CHILD WELFARE PROFESSIONALS TO REFER PARENTS. TO ENFORCEMENT WHILE KEEPING TRACK KEEPING CALIFORNIA LAW WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF FEDERAL LAW. AS A RESULT THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH BY ASSISTING THEM AND REUNITE RIO UNIFYING WITH THEIR FAMILIES I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING THIS LEGISLATION AND WE- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE A SEGMENT LISTED WITNESS ON THE PHONE- OPERATOR WE SHOULD HAVE A MISSED FORTY. I'M HERE BINYON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU BRING A FOUR K.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ONCE WE'VE CORRIMAL WILL MOVE ON THAT AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO ON TO AB THIS TIME EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THANK. YOU WE WILL BE HERE FOR A WHILE MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT'S OKAY. IT COMFORTABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN AND- GOOD TO SEE. THIS SUMMARIZED WITHIN AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE. WHICH ESTABLISHES THE HIRING TAX CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYERS THAT PRIORITIZE HIRING CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOUTH. I TRADITIONALLY I'M NOT A FAN OF TAX CREDITS FOR MANY MANY REASONS BUT GIVEN OUR SURPLUS GIVEN THE STATE OF OUR ECONOMY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BOTH A- LABOR SHORTAGE AND A PAY EQUITY SHORTAGE OF THIS BILLS PARTICULARLY CLOSE. TO MY HEART BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST POLICY CHALLENGES AS IT RELATES TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. HOW DO WE AS POLICYMAKERS CREATE AN EQUITABLE HIRING ENVIRONMENT. FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. MANY WHO COME FROM TRAUMA AND LACKS SOME OF THE SKILL TRAINING THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET- THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL FAMILY STABILIZATION AND- SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY. DATA SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA'S OVER SIXTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH. A WITH A THIRD LIVING IN LA COUNTY ALONE. ALL OF WHOM WILL AGE OUT AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND EVERY YEAR FOUR THOUSAND. CHILDREN AGE OUT OF THAT VERY SYSTEM. MANY WITHOUT ANY PARENTAL SUPPORT. OR FULLY ESTABLISHED PLAN OF HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES FINANCIALLY. WITH A NUMBER OF ON STABLE TRANSITIONS AND FOSTER CHILDREN'S LIVES TRAUMA FROM MENTAL PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND CREATE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO MAKE. THE TRANSITION OUT OF FOSTER HOME A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE WALDRON ACCORDING TO WALDEN FAMILY SERVICES SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF CHILDREN LEAVE FOSTER CARE AT AGE EIGHTEEN WITH NO PLACE TO CALL HOME. THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND POTENTIAL TEACHERS DOCTORS LAWYERS TECHNICIANS. SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS TECHNICIANS- AND ADVOCATES WHO LEAVE THE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR WHO NEED HELP TRANSITIONING INTO ADULTHOOD AND BECOMING THEIR- FULL SELVES. WE KNOW THAT FOSU SOME SUFFER FROM SOME OF THE WORST EMPLOYMENT AND SELF SUFFICIENCY OUTCOMES OF ANY POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN CHILDREN AGE OUT. NEARLY 20% OF THEM IMMEDIATELY BECOME HOMELESS OVER 40% AFTER THE FIRST YEAR. FOR MANY IT'S A NEVER ENDING CYCLE OF POVERTY DESPERATION- IN AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE ESTABLISHES A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ELIGIBLE FOSTER YOUTH PER YEAR TO INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR SMALL BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY HIGHER TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH CREATING CRITICAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EXPERIENCES EARLY UNEMPLOYMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOWER FUTURE EARNINGS. AND A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF COMING INTO CONTACT WITH OUR CARCERAL SYSTEM. STEFANI TODAY I'M JOINED BY CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF AYE FOSTER'S. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I AM ST **** AND I FOSTER IS- ARGUABLY ONE OF THE LARGEST OVERT EMPLOYERS OF FOSTER YOUTH HERE IN THE STATE- WE HIRE A HUNDRED TWENTY FOSTER YOUTH A YEAR AND THEN WE PUT THROUGH ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOSTER YOU THROUGH OUR EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. THAT GETS THEM PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT AT OVER A HUNDRED DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE LEARNED A COUPLE OF THINGS ALONG THE WAY-ARE USE EVEN IN A TIME AT SUCH AS NOW WHERE JOBS ARE PLENTIFUL AND- QUITE FRANKLY IF YOU CAN BREATHE YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A JOB- BUT KEEPING THAT JOB AND ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD- TOWARDS A CAREER IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SITUATION AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THE EXIT CARE I. UP ARGUABLY ARE UNDER EMPLOYED- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SKILL SETS THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THEM WHILE THEY WERE IN CARE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING. CONSISTENTLY WELL IN CARE AND SO AS THEY EXIT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO TRULY COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE SO THEY MIGHT GET A JOB TODAY BUT THEY'RE NOT KEEPING IT TOMORROW. AS OUR NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESSENTIALLY FAIL UP SO THEY NEED A SUPPORTED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS CRITICAL TO THEM AND EMPLOYERS CAN PROVIDE THAT. BUT THEY BUT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT THEY NEED THAT TAX INCENTIVE YOU WANT TO. HAVE THEM INVEST IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT IT WILL TAKE. SO WE ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE A WE HAVE A CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT OF FOSTER YOUTH IN THE STATE OF WITH WITHIN FOUR YEARS 50% OF FOSTER YOUTH WILL BE UNEMPLOYED. AND THOSE THAT ARE EMPLOYED ARE ONLY EARNING SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. SO GETTING THEM PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT IN ONTO PATHWAYS. TOWARDS CAREERS AND LIVING WAGE IS AT EIGHT EIGHT IS FUNDAMENTAL AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO HAVE THEM- A SCAFFOLDING INTO EMPLOYMENT WITH A PERMANENT- COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SO FAR YOU GET GOING. HERE TWO ONE FIVE NINE. THE WILL BE. THE LAST OF THE SERIES OF BILLS THAT I'LL BE PRESENTING TODAY THIS COMMITTEE- AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANTS- IN THE CHAIR THE TEAM FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK. ATTEMPT TO BRING THIS BILL A TODAY INTO TO GET IT TO THE BEST FORM THAT CAN BE AN- AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE IS A BILL THAT WILL STOP PERMANENT FAMILY SEPARATION IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOR PARENTS. WHO ARE PRE TRIAL. MEANING THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY WRONGDOING. IN OUR STATE WE HAVE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH. AND ONE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES CASES OPEN AND IT'S OUT OF PLACE OF OSCAR CBS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE ELIGIBILITY OF ALL PARENTS FOR REUNIFICATION SERVICES. THEY ALSO REQUIRED WAS TO BEGIN ASSISTING THE PARENT WITH THE PROCESS OF REUNITING WITH THEIR CHILD. FOR PARENTS IN CUSTODY THIS COULD INCLUDE INVESTIGATING WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEIR PARENTS AT THEIR PLACE ONE CAR SERRATION. SUCH AS ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASS THE A IN A LIFE SKILLS. IN HELPING THE PARENTING ROLE IN THESE COURSES IN ADDITION TO OTHER IN REGION REENTRY SERVICES. THE COULD ALSO BE MAILING SPECIALIZED INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAN BE COMPLETED IN THE MAIL BACK. WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF FILING. OF A CHILD WELFARE CASE THE JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ORDER THE PARENT INTO REUNIFICATION SERVICES. OR IF. THAT GROUP OF PARENTS WILL BE BYPASSED FOR THOSE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY FIT INTO ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT CAN BE DENIED REUNIFICATION. IF PARENTS ARE BY PASSED THE COURT WAS THAT HEARING MAKE A PERMANENT PLAN FOR THE CHILD WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE. SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT BYPASS PROVISIONS. THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROBLEM AT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO FIX. IS IN THE SEPARATION PRISON PROVISION THAT CURRENTLY STATES THAT IF YOU ARE A PARENT WHO IS INCARCERATED. YOU CN BE BYPASSED EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY WRONGDOING. WE NEED TO FIX THIS POST BAIL WHICH IS LARGELY A REFLECTION OF YOUR ECONOMIC STATUS YOU WON'T BE BYPASS FOR REUNIFICATION SERVICES BUT FOR PARENTS WERE UNABLE TO POSTED BAIL. REMAIN PRE TRIAL YOU COULD LOSE CUSTODY OF YOUR CHILDREN FOREVER AND HAVE YOUR RIGHTS TERMINATED EVEN IF YOU ARE NEVER FOUND CONVICTED. YOUR ULTIMATELY ACQUITTED OR THE CASE IS DROPPED. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO AND WHAT IT WILL DO IS IN THAT PROCESS OF BY PASSING THOSE PARENTS LARGELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC STATUS PREVENTS THEM FROM POSTING BAIL. I AM RETURNING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES. TO GIVE TESTIMONY WITH ME TODAY I'M JOINED BY DAVID MYERS IS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES AND CHRISTINA CURTIS WAS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LOS ANGELES. DEPENDENCY LAWYERS. THANK YOU OPERATOR IF WE HAVE- EITHER MISS CURTIS OR MISTER MEYERS ONLINE. YOUR HONOR BUT I'M- MY NAME IS DAVID MYERS AND TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED MEMBERS AND GUESTS- I AM AN ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS CHILDREN AND PARENTS TO COME BEFORE CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT. AT YOU KNOW OUR WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE STARTS RIGHT WITH SECTION THREE HUNDRED POINT TWO WHICH HELD THAT THAT OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IF YOU ONLY BE A TEMPORARY INTERVENTION FOR TWO REASONS ONE TO KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND TO STRENGTHEN FAMILY. REMOVING CHILDREN SHOULD NOT OCCUR UNLESS THERE ARE NO OTHER OPTIONS. AND TERMINATING PARENTAL RIGHTS SHOULD NEVER OCCUR TO THE FAMILY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. I HAVE A CLIENT NAMED TONYA. TWO MONTHS AGO SHE WAS ON A DATE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. SHE KNEW HER BOYFRIEND AS HE WAS THE FATHER OF HER TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY HER BOYFRIEND WAS GOING TO COMMIT A SERIOUS FELONY. GIVEN THAT TIME HE WAS IN THE CAR. SHE TOO HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH THAT SAME FELONY. THE CRIMINAL COURT IS HOLDING HER ON TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BAIL. WHICH MEANS THAT MY CLIENT NEEDS TO COME UP WITH TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET OUT. THE FIGHT WITH THE STATE'S SHE'S STILL IN JAIL. CAPITEC THE SERVICES REMOVED HER TWO CHILDREN. AT THE SAID HERE TODAY GUILTY. OF CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE PENDING BUT THEY MAY NOT BE RESULT FROM. BUDGET ALSO A PERSON OF. AS ARE MOST OF THE CLIENTS WE HAVE. TWO DAYS FROM NOW THE JUVENILE DEPENDENCY JUDGE IS GOING TO TELL TANYA. THAT SHE FELT TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN. AND HE WILL NEVER BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET HER CHILDREN BACK. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THAT CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND THE- COURTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AND THEY DO SO WITH GREAT FREQUENCY. THIS BILL HOWEVER IT WILL NOT ALLOW COURTS TO DENY FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY. UNTIL OR UNLESS A PARENT ACTUALLY CONVICTED. OF A CRIME. AFTER THURSDAY OUR COURT WITH THAT HEARING IN TONYA K. IN AUGUST TO TERMINATE HER PARENTAL RIGHTS. IF THE CHARGES ARE. STILL PENDING SHE WILL LOSE HER PARENTAL RIGHTS. WORSE THOUGH IF YOU IF THE CHARGES ARE DROPPED OR NEGOTIATED AND PARTY IS RELEASED BEFORE AUGUST. THEN SHE WILL HAVE TO PROVE WHY IT IS BEST FOR HER CHILDREN THAT SHE BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY MR MYERS AT EVERY COURT LEGAL YOU TO. PLEASE THANK YOU. YES OUR COURTS WON'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE HER A HEARING- THANK YOU GO TO THE OTHER- WITNESS- MISS CURTIS. WHAT YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CURTIS AND I'M A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLITICAL AND THE CO CHAIR OF A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR BOTH LOTS AND LOTS AND THE PENALTY LAWYERS AND SAN DIEGO LEGAL SERVICE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS A BIGGER HOW WELL SYSTEM IN THE U. STATES. SO IMPROPER. FOR TEST TODAY. I WAS CONFIDENT I'D BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT PERFECT WITNESS TO GIVE THAT SYMPATHETIC STORY TO SHARE WITH YOU. HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE ONE. NOT BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NOT A PROBLEM A LOT OF BANDS WITH THE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS SO PREVALENT. MOST OF OUR JOURNEYS HAVE REPRESENTED AN INCARCERATED PARENTS. AWAITING TRIAL WHO HAD BEEN BY PASSED BY THE PROVISION. HOWEVER BY THE TIME A CLIENT IF IT QUITS FOR THE CRIMES THEY WERE CHARGED WITH. THE DAMAGE HAVE LONG BEEN DONE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE HOW THE TIME WONDERS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN THE PARENTS BY PASSED. COMPARED TO THE TIMELINE TO CONCLUDE A CRIMINAL CASE. WHERE THE CRIMINAL CASE CAN AT TIMES TAKE OVER A YEAR TO PROSECUTE. WHEN A PARENT IS BY PATH. PARENTAL RIGHTS CAN BE TERMINATED AND THE CHILD FREE FOR ADOPTION AND AS LITTLE AS SIX MONTHS. FROM THE INITIATION. OF THE DEPENDENCY CASES. IT MEANS THAT BY THE- IT HAS BEEN A- FOR CRIMES. THEIR CHILD AND LIKELY BEEN PLAYED FOR DOC AND THEIR TIME FOR AS LONG PAST. TO BE CLEAR. THE PROBLEM BY LARGE AFFECT PARENTS YOU CANNOT THEIR BAIL PARENTS OF GREATER MEANS YOU CAN'T AFFORD BILL WILL ABSOLUTELY BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN THEIR CARE THROUGH REUNIFICATION SERVICE BUT APPARENTLY CANNOT WILL RISK HAVING THEIR CHILDREN STAY FOR ADOPTION AND A LIGHTNING PACE. ALTHOUGH THIS LAW WHICH CREATED WITHOUT THE CONTENT AS IT STANDS WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION THREE SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE HE CONTINUES TO MARGINALIZE ALREADY MARGINALIZED FAMILIES BY PERMANENTLY REMOVING CHILDREN FROM THEIR CARE.

I FEEL LIKE TO FINISH UP THANK YOU AGAIN THIS BILL PASSED ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE TWO SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THE MOST DISPARATE IMPACT FOR BLACK BROWN POOR AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ARE THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THIS IS A DEEP INTERSECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO INNER CITY- BETWEEN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS AND IT'S AN INTERSECTION WHERE CHILDREN ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. WHERE IF YOU ARE POOR AND YOU ARE INCARCERATED AND YOU CANNOT AFFORD A TO BAIL OUT YOU CAN LOSE CUSTODY OF YOUR CHILDREN FOREVER EVEN IF THE CHARGES ARE DROPPED AND YOU ARE QUITTED.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHARITY STOP FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND ARE QUITE GLADLY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY THREE HUNDRED WOULD EXEMPT CAL WORKS AND CALFRESH RECIPIENTS FROM EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THREE MONTHS IF THEY STATE THAT THEY LEFT THE JOB TO UNPREDICTABLE SCHEDULED HOURS ARE VIOLATIONS OF ANY WORKPLACE RIGHTS. GRANTED TO THEM BY LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL LABOR LAWS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES TO INFORM RECIPIENTS OF THEIR WORKPLACE RIGHTS OF THE VOLUNTARILY LEAVE A JOB. CALFRESH AND CAL ROADS PROVIDE CRUCIAL FINANCIAL AID AND FOOD ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES. FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THESE PROGRAMS ARE THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL. THEREFORE CALIBRATION CALORIES PARTICIPANTS ARE PLACED UNDER IMMENSE PESSURE RETAIN THEIR FULL BENEFITS AND AVOID BEING SANCTIONED. UNDER CERTAIN SECTORS CIRCUMSTANCES PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS MAY BE GRANTED A GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION FROM SANCTIONS THAT IS APPLIED IN RESPONSE TO ABUSIVE OR ADVERSE WORK ENVIRONMENTS. WHILE HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES CAN GRANT EXEMPTIONS THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO OFFER THEM OR INFORM PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS OF THEIR WORKPLACE RIGHTS WHEN THEY VOLUNTARILY LEAVE A JOB. FURTHERMORE TENNEY WAS GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS CAN MAKE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS FEEL PRESSURED TO REMAIN IN ABUSIVE AND OTHERWISE INJURIOUS WORK ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING ESPECIALLY SINCE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF HAVING THEIR WORKPLACE RIGHTS VIOLATED. RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THAT 4280% OF WOMEN WORKERS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE RIGHT PLACE WITH MORE. WITH WITH MORE INCIDENCES FOUND IN LOW WAGE WORK.

I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN LGBTQ YOUTH OF COLOR TRAVEL CHILDREN. IN FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS. THE LONELINESS LACK OF FORMAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND SOCIAL ISOLATIONS THEY ARE ALL. EXPERIENCING HAVE INCREASED DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES DO NOT SHOW ACCEPTED BEHAVIOR ARE ALWAYS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO ENTER FOSTER CARE OR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAN ANY OTHER GROUP. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COVERT NINETEEN HAS ALSO INCREASED THE RATE OF EDUCATION DISRUPTION FAMILY CONFLICTS AND USE UNDER EIGHTEEN WHO IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ BEING KICKED OUT OF THEIR FAMILY HOMES. WE BELIEVE. THAT WITH CONCRETE INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE PARENTS CAN AFFIRM AND SUPPORT THEIR LGBTQ AND GENDER EXPANSIVE CHILDREN THUS FAMILIES REMAIN INTACT AND FAMILIES PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED CAN BE REUNIFIED. THE YOUTH ACCEPTANCE PROJECT FACILITATED BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FAMILY BUILDERS IS AN EXISTING INTERVENTION WORKING WITH THE FAMILIES OF LGBTQ AND GENDER EXPANSIVE CHILDREN AND YOU IN GENERAL. THE INTERVENTION SERVICES SERVES AS A FAMILY PRESERVATION AND FAMILY YOU RE UNIFICATION TOOL ASSISTING FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY EXPRESSION OF THEIR CHILD. THE CLINICIANS USE A TRAUMA INFORMACIJE CO EDUCATIONAL MODEL TO ADDRESS THE MISINFORMATION RESISTANCE FEAR AND GRIEF THAT FAMILIES CAN OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH. THIS MODEL IS INTENTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO THE FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES WITHIN THEIR OWN CULTURE RELIGION AND RACE. AB TWO SIX SIX THREE WOULD TRANSFORM THE YOUTH ACCEPTANCE PROJECT INTO A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM ACROSS AT LEAST THREE COUNTIES INCLUDING SAMBAR DINO. THIS BILL WOULD SPARK ADDITIONAL COUNTY AND REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO ADDRESS THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF LGBTQ YOUTH WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. THE YOUTH ACCEPTANCE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO WORK BOTH WITH FAMILIES OF CHILDREN ALREADY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND FAMILIES OF CHILDREN AT RISK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ENTERING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AB TWO SIX SIX THREE WOULD EXPAND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF YAP INTERVENTIONS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF LGBTQ CHILDREN AMONG PARENTS PARENTS CARE GIVERS TRIBAL MEMBERS FOSTER PARENTS ADOPTIVE PARENTS EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS AND ADDITIONAL STAFF INVOLVED. IN CHILD CARE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ADRIAN SHELTON WITH A CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE NVDA CAVELL ARE WHO IS THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE YOUTH ACCEPTANCE PROJECT. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ADRIAN SHELTON I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NATIONALLY ACCREDITED COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE SERVING CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND FAMILIES IN PUBLIC HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEMS. WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWO SIX SIX THREE TODAY- THIS BILL AIMS TO HELP ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE OVER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND NOT AS LGBTQ AND GENDER EXPANSIVE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FAMILY REJECTION AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AND THE NUMBER OF LGBTQ YOUTH WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THIS PAST YEAR PAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR SO MANY AND WE KNOW THAT LGBT Q. YOU HAVE FACED EVEN GREATER AND UNIQUE CHALLENGES ONE HEARTBREAKING STATISTICS FROM THE TREVOR PROJECT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE. A NATIONAL SURVEY IS THAT 42% OF LGBTQ YOUTH SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED SUICIDE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR INCLUDING MORE THAN HALF OF TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY YOUTH. SO IN THE WAKE OF THE DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS BILL REALLY OFFERS A BRIGHT SPOT AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER FOR THIS POPULATION. BY EXPANDING A PROVEN MODEL OF INTERVENTION TO PREVENT LGBTQ PLUS HOMELESSNESS TO SUPPORT TO SUPPORT FAMILY ACCEPTANCE AND PERMANENCY. AND SO WITH US ALSO ON THE PHONE TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE YOUTH ACCEPTANCE PROJECT AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FAMILY BUILDERS VIDAK KABA. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ARE WHY I INTRODUCED THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHES A THREE YEAR GRANT PROGRAM. TO FUND ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING PLACE BASED SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES FROM BIRTH THROUGH COLLEGE AND CAREER. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS AND OTHER PLACE BASED CRADLE TO CAREER NETWORK NETWORKS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK.

ALTHOUGH LATINOS ONLY MADE UP 15% OF THE CITY'S POPULATION. THEY WERE 55% OF THE KOBE POSITIVE CASES. BECAUSE OF THEIR CROWDED LIVING CONDITIONS REFLECTING THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND BECAUSE OF THEIR CENTRAL JOBS THAT COULD BE DONE FROM HOME. THE TRUST THAT OUR PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD BUILT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE NETWORKED APPROACH WE HAVE DEVELOPED WITH OTHER AGENCIES PUT US IN A POSITION TO REACH THESE FAMILIES. AND TO WORK WITH THE CITY TO DISTRIBUTE EMERGENCY RESOURCES INCLUDING EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN INCOME REPLACEMENT FUNDS TO SIX THOUSAND FAMILIES. ALLOWING THEM TO QUARANTINE AT HOME WHEN NEEDED.

IN SOME CASES THE ADOPTION FAIL FAILS AND THE CHILDREN HAS BEEN RE ESTABLISHED- A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PARENTS HOWEVER. THE STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OF THIS PROCESS IT ABSOLUTELY LACKS OLDER FOSTER YOUTH NEEDS HELP WHEN FOSTER YOU TURNED OUT OF THE SYSTEM THEY ARE LEFT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. HAVING FAMILY CONNECTION DURING THIS TIMES PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED FOR THAT FAMILY BOND AS A MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. I AM ALSO AWARE OF THE CRISIS WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN FOSTER YOUTH THE CRISIS IS SIMILAR IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THAT THE- COMMUNITY FAMILY CULTURES CONNECTION MATTERS AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT ASSEMBLY BUILD SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR STRENGTHENS FAMILY CONNECTION. EVERY CHILD DESERVES A LOVING AND A PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP EVERY CHILD DESERVES. TO FEEL SAFE WANTED LOVE AND HURT BY THE COMMUNITY THEY IDENTIFY WITH AND FOSTER COMMUNITY FOSTER COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS WITH THAT COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY NINETY FOUR PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD FOR THESE FAMILIES JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY BY PHONE- IS MERITED ALEXANDER SUPERVISING ATTORNEY WITH THE CHILDREN LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK SHE IS SHOULD BE ON THE PHONE IF YOU SHOULD BE ON THE PHONE THAT'S CORRECT OPERATOR YES I'M HERE CAN. YOU HEAR ME. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND ULTIMATELY FOSTER BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM UNMERITED ALEXANDER AN ATTORNEY SUPERVISOR AT THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA. I WAS PREVIOUSLY A CASE CARRYING ATTORNEY FOR CLC REPRESENTING CHILDREN AND DEPENDENCY COURT DALY AND BEFORE JOINING CLC I WORKED IN FAMILY LAW. CLC IS THE LARGEST CHILDREN'S LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION ADVOCATING FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTY EACH YEAR. IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IF A CHILD CANNOT SAFELY BE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR FAMILY ADOPTION IS THE PREFERRED PLAN. PERMANENT IS CRITICAL FOR OUR CLIENTS BUT THERE IS ALSO A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT FOR MANY ADOPTEES IT IS ALSO CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN SOME CONNECTION TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. AND THAT MAINTAINING THESE CONNECTIONS CAN OFTEN BE SAFE AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS. I'VE SEEN IN NUMEROUS CASES THAT WHILE ADOPTION CAN BRING GREAT JOY THERE CAN ALSO BE A SIGNIFICANT GRIEF AND LOSS WHEN A CHILD IS PERMANENTLY CUT FROM ALL CONNECTION TO THEIR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. RESEARCH SHOWS THE SIBLING BOND IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN MITIGATING THE TRAUMA OF FAMILY SEPARATION. THE BACK WE HEAR FROM OUR CLIENT HAS REINFORCED THE VERACITY OF THIS RESEARCH. WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING SIBLING CONNECTIONS POSTED OPTION IS ALREADY RECOGNIZED IN THE LAW BY REQUIRING CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO SET UP A MEETING TO EXECUTE OPPOSED ADOPTION CONTRACT FOUR SIBLINGS WHEN PRACTICABLE. IN PRACTICE WE RARELY SEE THESE MEETINGS TAKE PLACE AND TOO OFTEN WE SEE OUR CLIENTS LOSE ALL CONTACT WITH THEIR SIBLINGS RESULTING IN TRAUMA THAT CAN LAST WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. THIS BILL AN EXISTING LAW TO ENSURE THESE MEETINGS DO TAKE PLACE TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF POSTS ADOPTION CONTACT BETWEEN SIBLINGS. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD CREATE PATHWAYS TO REINSTATE PARENTAL RIGHTS FOR USE WHEN IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND AGAIN THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GETS SENT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR.

AND KEY WORDS TWIN BROTHER AND THEY WERE FIVE SIBLINGS AND THEY WERE SEPARATED- AND NOT KNOW THAT HIS TWIN BROTHER LIVED FIVE BLOCKS AWAY THE SOCIAL WORKER DECIDED TO GO AGAINST THE RULES AND RE. BOTH BROTHERS WHO ATTENDED THE SAME SCHOOL DIDN'T EVEN THOUGH THEY ATTENDED THE SAME SCHOOL AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE REUNIFICATION TOOK PLACE THE RISK. AND INDEED THE ABILITY FOR HIM TO CONNECT WITH HIS BIOLOGICAL TWIN BROTHER. YEAH IT ALSO. STOPPED ABILITY TO SEE WHETHER NOT THERE'S MANNERISMS THAT HE- SHARED WITH HIS TWIN BROTHER- OR ANY SIMILARITIES OF MOTHER AND FATHER AND SO THIS BILL IS A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO MAKING SURE. IN CASES TO THAT THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE UNIFY- THAT FAMILY STRUCTURE SPECIALLY AMONG SIBLINGS WE DO JUST THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I VOTE FOR.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. I WE'LL START WITH THAT- AB TWENTY NINETY THAT WORKS GREAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THERE ARE LONGSTANDING CONCERNS REGARDING THE HIGHER WORKLOADS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS IN CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES FACE. WHEN WORKLOADS BECOME UNMANAGEABLE IT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE SOCIAL WORKER BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS THE WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN THE YOUTH AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE BEING SERVED. SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE FACTORS. AS COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO REACH THEIR RATIO GOALS THEY SHOULD BE PROPERLY RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND BEST PRACTICES. AB TWENTY NINETY WILL PROVIDE FISCAL INCENTIVES TO COUNTIES WHO MEET CALIFORNIA'S GUIDELINES FOR CHILD WELFARE SOCIAL WORKER WORKLOAD RATIOS. THUS REWARDING THE GOOD ACTORS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHO LABOR TO CARE FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH. REBECA GONZALEZ FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IS ON THE PHONE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINETY THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ PLEASE GO AHEAD.

WORKLOAD RATIOS IN THIRTEEN STATES PUBLIC CHILD WELFARE ADMINISTRATORS HIGH WORKLOAD ENERGY FUNDS WERE AMONG THE TOP REASONS BUT PREVENTABLE TURNOUT BURKE STAFF TURNOVER IS ALSO COSTLY TO AGENCIES WHEN CONSIDERING SEPARATION. RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING COSTS. NOT TO MENTION THE HARM CHILDREN THEY'RE QUE ARE GIVEN THE IT'S THEY DID. HOLD TIME DUE TO HIGH CASELOAD HAS SEVERAL AFFECT CONFLICT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF STRENGTH BASED INDIVIDUALIZED CARE. INCLUDING THE DIFFICULTY FACED BY CASE WORKERS TO DO THEIR JOBS AND THEY ARE OFTEN CORRECT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE LONG TERM COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENSIVE SERVICES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX. AND MULTI FACETED NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. HAVE NOTED THE VERY IMPACT THE WORKLOAD WITHIN PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICE SETTINGS INCLUDING CHILD WELFARE EXCESSIVE WORKLOADS TEND TO INCREASE WORKER STRESS AND REDUCE THEIR BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL WELL BEING WHICH IN TURN LEAD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF TURNOVER. IN ADDITION WORKLOAD CONTRIBUTES TO CASE WORKERS AT CAPACITY TO ENGAGE CHILDREN AND FAMILY PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES AND ACCOMPLISH INTENDED OUTCOME. EFFECTIVE WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM CAN ALLOW CASE WORKERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ON INVESTIGATION CASE PLANNING AND EVALUATION THEREFOREVERIFY EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING SAFETY PERMANENCY AND WELL BEING FOR THE CHILDREN THEY SERVE.

WELL DONE THANK YOU NOT HAVE OUR COMPLETE ATTENTION HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB- TWENTY FIVE NINETY FIVE A BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT CANNABIS IS TREATED JUST AS ANY OTHER LEGAL SUBSTANCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CHILD CUSTODY AND DEPENDENCY COURT OFFICE MADE HAD BEEN AWARE OF INCIDENTS WERE FAMILIES ARE BROUGHT INTO DEPENDENCY COURT FOR THE MERE POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MERE POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS IS INSUFFICIENT TO TAKE CUSTODY OF A FAMILY UNDER CASE LAW. YET AND STILL WE ARE AWARE OF SITUATION WHERE FAMILIES ARE DRAGGED INTO COURT MERELY DUE TO POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATION PROCESS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IT ONLY REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT AT OVERSEAS INVESTIGATIONS. TO ENSURE THAT ALL REGULATIONS GUIDANCE GIVEN TO COUNTY STREETS CANVAS THE SAME AS ALCOHOL OR LEGALLY CRIED MEDICATION. DRIVE FAMILIES INTO COURT FOR POSSESSION OF CANNABIS IS NOT ONLY A STRESSFUL EVENT THERE WERE CARS TAKING TIME OFF. OR JUGGLING SCHEDULES BE INCREDIBLY TRAUMATIC FOR. THIS BILL MAKE SURE THAT INVESTIGATION STILL HAVE THE TOOLS INVESTIGATORS ARE TO DETERMINE NEGLECT OR ABUSE BUT DOES NOT BURDEN FAMILIES FOR THE LEGAL POSSESSION OF.

IN MAJOR ISSUE FACING OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM TODAY INVOLVES THE DISPARATE TREATMENT APPARENTLY THE CANNABIS PERSON. ALCOHOL ARE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATION. IT'S CLOSE THE TIED TO AND SOCIOECONOMIC BIAS. TWENTY TWELVE THE COURT OF APPEAL HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A PARENT CANNABIS USE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE STATE TO ENTER HERE AND THE FAMILY. RIGHT I THINK THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES HOLD TO THE SYSTEM SIMPLY BECAUSE APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT AT SOME POINT IN THE MAJORITY OF THESE CASES THE CHILD IS DOING WELL AND THE PHONE HE WANTS TO BE WITH THEIR PARENTS AND HAS NEVER BEEN ABUSED OR NEGLECTED HOWEVER WHEN A PARENT DISCLOSES CANNABIS USE PAST OR PRESENT SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE FIELD ARE SIMPLY PRESUMING CHILD NEGLECT. EVEN WITHOUT ANY FACTS TO BACK THAT UP AND WHAT'S WORSE IS OFTEN USED AS A PRETEXT TO BE STRAPPED INTO SEPARATE FAMILIES OF COLOR AS A RESULT OF THESE WORKERS DECISION A CHILD SUFFERS. THE AGENCY THE JACKSON FAMILY THE CONSTANT PHONE CALLS DROPPIN INTERROGATIONS AND ACCUSATIONS THE FAMILY FUNCTIONING AT THIS RAPID AND THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN LIVE IN FEAR OF BEING INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FIVE WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SCHERING THAT THE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GIVEN PROPER GUIDANCE.
