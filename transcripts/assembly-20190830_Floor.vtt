SB FIVE THIRTY ONE AND I THINK

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:16.722
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:18.324
TAKE A STEP BACK. AND THINK

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:22.195
ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:24.130
OUR CONSTITUENTS NOT JUST IN

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:24.730
THE REGIONS THAT WE COME FROM

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:25.965
BUT IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:28.367
CALIFORNIA. THE POLICY. OF

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:29.936
HAVING DIFFERENT CITIES COMPETE

01:58:30.002 --> 01:58:31.838
WITH EACH OTHER TO SEE HOW MUCH

01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:33.105
TAX REVENUE THEY CAN GIVE A WAY

01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:35.842
TO LOWER A COMPANY. TO LOCATE.

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.243
A FULFILLMENT CENTER IN THEIR

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:38.778
CITY IS NOT A GOOD ONE IT'S NOT

01:58:38.845 --> 01:58:41.614
A GOOD ONE. FOR CALIFORNIA AS A

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:43.583
WHOLEAND ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:44.784
GOOD FOR THAT PARTICULAR CITY

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:45.985
IF THEY GET THAT FULFILLMENT

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.553
CENTER. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ALL

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.121
OF OUR CITIES PUT TOGETHER AND

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:49.889
I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:50.923
REPRESENTING AN AREA OF THE

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:52.225
STATE. THAT ACTUALLY DOES

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:54.827
BETTER THAN NOT UNDER THE

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:55.461
CURRENT POLICY SO YOU KNOW THAT

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:57.530
MY THOUGHTS ARE SINCERE. BUT I

01:58:57.597 --> 01:58:58.431
ALSO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.666
THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AS A BODY.

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.201
AT THIS ENTIRE POLICY OF HOUSE

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.936
SALES TAX REVENUE ON ON LINE

01:59:04.003 --> 01:59:06.138
SALES IS DISTRIBUTED. YEAH I'M

01:59:06.205 --> 01:59:09.208
REALLY HOPEFUL THAT NEXT YEAR

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:09.809
WE WILL SIT DOWN AND HAVE THIS

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:16.082
DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT IS NOT.

01:59:16.148 --> 01:59:17.416
SORT OF GOING TO A STORE THAT

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:18.885
THE SALES TAX REVENUE FROM THAT

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.686
SALE GOES TO A CITY OTHER THE

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:21.487
NEEDLES BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:23.656
NEEDLES. THERE DEPENDING ON AT

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:24.957
THAT REVENUE TO PAVE THE

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:26.325
STREETS AND A POLICE THE

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:27.460
COMMUNITY AND WE'RE TAKING THAT

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:29.195
REVENUE AWAY FROM THEM. SO I

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.162
THINK THAT WE REALLY AS A STATE

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.464
NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:33.432

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:38.371
LOCATION OF WHERE THOSE GOODS

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:39.972

GENERAL VICINITY OF THE CITY'S
