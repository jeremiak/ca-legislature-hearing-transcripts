CHAIRMAN OF SUTTER COUNTY

DURING THE TWO THOUSAND THREE.

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:43.139
RECALL OF GRAY DAVIS. HE WAS MY

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:45.208
MENTOR IN SO MANY WAYS HE HAD

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:47.143

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.589
ABLE TO TALK ON YOUR FEET. AND

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:00.156
YOU WOULD ADMIT HE WAS NEVER

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:02.325
REALLY GOOD AT THAT. HE WAS A

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:04.928
MAN OF FEW WORDS. BUT HE MEANT

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.596
WHAT HE SAID AND HE SAID WHAT

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:10.633
HE MEANT. OVER THE YEARS HE

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.001
WELCOMED AS TREASURED GAS

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.803
PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:14.337
BACKGROUNDS AND POLITICAL

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.874
PERSUASIONS. AND EVEN WITH THAT

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:18.508
AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARGUED WHICH

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.710
WAS OFTEN. HE KEPT THEM COMING

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.979
BACK FOR MORE. HE LOVED THIS

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:25.548
COUNTRY. HE WOULD ALWAYS

00:56:25.615 --> 00:56:27.117
ENCOURAGE US NOT TO TAKE OUR

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:29.185
FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED. TO HONOR

00:56:29.252 --> 00:56:31.287
OUR VETERANS AND THOSE WHO HAVE

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.356
GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR LIBERTY.

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:34.524
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PLACE IS A

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:36.326
TRAP TRIP TRAVEL IS BRANSON

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.094
MISSOURI BECAUSE OF THE MANY

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:40.230
PATRIOTIC SHOWS. AND THE BIG

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:42.265
BAND MUSIC THAT REMINDED HIM OF

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:45.769
HIS TIMES OF MY GRANDMOTHER. HE

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:46.770
BELIEVES IN TREATING A MAN

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.404
FAIRLY AND FIGHTING FOR A

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.974
RIGHTEOUS CAUSE. I THINK THAT'S

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.510
AN ESPECIALLY IRISH TRADE.

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:54.010
HANDED DOWN THROUGH THE

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:56.346
GENERATIONS MAYBE IT WAS

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:57.914
BECAUSE OF HOW MY ANCESTORS

00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:00.316
WERE TREATED BACK IN IRELAND.

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.418
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OWN LAND

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:02.952

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:05.855
PITTANCE. OR HOW WE WERE

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:06.456
TREATED WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.825
AMERICA. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:12.328
OF HIS GRANDMOTHER. HE TREATED

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:12.896
THOSE WHO WORK FOR HIM LIKE

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:15.665
