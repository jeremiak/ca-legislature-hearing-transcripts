HI MATHIS NIGHT HERE. HERE I CAN ENHANCE. FLORA. FOR MY FIRST NIGHT IRWIN HI. JOHN. JONES SAWYER LEVINE. LEVINE ROBERT RIVAS I NEVER READ THE SIGNS YEAH. THAT IS ADOPTED -- MISTER REAVIS IS HEREBY TODAY PRESENTING ON AB FIVE EIGHTY SIX AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE REAL ACT [inaudible] OF EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN OPPORTUNITY A NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIALLY. THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL LAND. AND SO UT A LOSSES OF AGRICULTURE FOREMAN RANGE LAND ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION. ANYA LOSSES AVERAGE AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR. AND SO SUCH LOSSES BECAUSE THIS IS A A SERIOUS THREAT TO AGRICULTURE. CERTAINLY TO OUR LOCAL AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES -- AND TO STATEWIDE FOOD PRODUCTION. AND SO ACCORDING TO THE DATA FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE. WE KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR FARMERS IS RISING. WITH THE CURRENT AVERAGE AGE OF OF NEARLY SIXTY YEARS OLD. WE ALSO SEE THE GAP BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE FARMERS CLOSING. AS A NUMBER OF FEMALE FARMERS HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. WE KNOW THAT AG PRODUCTION EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. I AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THE WAY FUNDING HAS ALSO INCREASED OVER TIME. WE ALSO SEE THE TRENDING SHIFT TO LARGER AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS WITH CROP ACREAGE BEING CONCENTRATED IN FEWER. BUT LARGER FIRMS [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY -- WE SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENTERING AGRICULTURE DECLINING YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THIS POTENTIAL SHORTAGE OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS. SHOULD BE ONE OF THE PRIMARY PROBLEMS WE SEEK TO RESOLVE AS A STATE. I AS A FORM IS TOUGH. NOW AND AND ENCOURAGING THE NEXT GENERATION TO FARM TO BECOME FARMERS IS AN INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE. AND SO INCREASINGLY HIGH LAND PRICES LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES. THESE ARE BARRIERS FOR ALL FARMERS -- AND FOR SOCIALLY -- THE DISADVANTAGE FARMERS THESE BARRIERS CAN BE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. AND SO I COMMEND ASSEMBLYWOMAN ARGUE ARE CURRY FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON AGRICULTURAL ISSUES AND FOR HER WORK IN CHAMPIONING THE FARMER QUITY ACT OF OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SIGNED INTO LAW BY -- GOVERNOR BROWN THE FORMER EQUITY ACT NOW REQUIRES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO FOCUS ON AND ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACING FARMERS OF COLOR IN OUR STATE. BY MAKING ACCESS TO STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES MORE EQUITABLE. AND SO AS A RESULT OUR STATE -- MUST STRIVE TO INSTITUTIONALIZE EQUITY. WITHIN OUR AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. I AM FOLLOWING THESE LINES THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE REAL LOAN FUND PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE LOANS AND GRANTS TO ARE SOCIALLY -- AT THE DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND CREATE OPPORTUNITY. TO ACCESS FARMLAND AND RANGE LAND OWNERSHIP OF OR LONG TERM LEASES. AND SO THIS BILLS EVERYTHING THE FARMER EQUITY ACT INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- AB NINE EIGHT SIX WOULD LEAD TO AN EQUITABLE INVESTMENT OF STATE RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE. OF SOCIALLY. DISADVANTAGED FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO HAVE A SOME SPONSORS THAT ARE ALL OF THEM TO DO SOME CELLS. FIRST PERSON PLEASE YEAH GOOD MORNING AUDIBLE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERS OF I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND THE AUTHOR -- FOR THIS BILL -- I BET SMOKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARMER JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE AND WE ARE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND OUR SPONSORS OF THE FARMER EQUITY ACT WITH ASSEMBLY. WOMAN I WE ARE CURRY -- THE COLLABORATIVE REPRESENTS A DIVERSE GROUP OF FARMERS OF COLORS AND ALLIES WITH A SHARED VISION OF A FAIR FOOD SYSTEM. WHICH AIMS TO DISMANTLE INJUSTICES IN THE FOOD SYSTEM AS MY COLLEAGUES WILL EXPAND UPON AND IS LIKELY NO SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOU WE KNOW THAT ACCESS TO LAND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OBSTACLES FARMERS FACE IN SUCCESSFULLY FARMING. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF AG CENSUS THAT WAS RELEASED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO CALIFORNIA IS LOSING ON AVERAGE FOR FARMS PER DAY. AT THE SAME TIME THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS ARE SHIFTING WITH THE NUMBERS OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY ACROSS THE STATE. IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN THE TOP PRODUCER OF OUR NATION'S FOOD WITH SALES AT FOUR FORTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE LAST ACTS AND SAYS. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE FARMERS THAT OUR STATE IS BECOMING DEPENDED ON TO GROW OUR FOOD. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS TO LANDS AND WITHOUT ALL THAT MY COLLEAGUES PROVIDE DEEPER CONTEXT ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PERSON SPEAKING IN SUPPORT PLEASE GOOD MORNING. HORRIBLE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON AB -- NINETY SIX MY NAME IS MICHAEL MILLION I'M HERE TODAY WEARING TWO DIFFERENT HATS I WORK FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA -- THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AS THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY AGRICULTURAL PLAN. I'M ALSO A VOLUNTEER POLICY ADVISER -- FOR THE NONPROFIT KITCHEN TABLE ADVISORS WHICH SUPPORTS THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SMALL SMALL FARMS AND RANCHES ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- MOSTLY THROUGH ONE ON ONE BUSINESS ADVISING PREDOMINATELY SERVING SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS. SO AS A FORMER FARMER MYSELF AND WITHOUT THE INHERITANCE OF LAND FOR A FAMILY BUSINESS TO CONTINUE -- I UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE FIRST HAND HOW DIFFICULT IT CAN BE ACCESS FARMLAND. IN MY CURRENT WORK -- I SIT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION THAT THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT THAT THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA I MANAGED AYE AN AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENT PROGRAM. THAT IS WORKING TO PROTECT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND IS HIGHLY VULNERABLE -- TO DEVELOPMENT AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCALE OUR CONTACTS THERE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS SANTA CLARA COUNTY HAS LOST -- THAT SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY NINE SIDE KITCHEN TABLE ADVISERS WHEN THE MOST COMMON AND MOST DIFFICULT PROCESSES THAT WE WORK WITH OUR CLIENTS ON IS FINDING APPROPRIATE FARM LAND FOR PURCHASE OR FOR LEASE SON BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT WE DO NOT YET HAVE ENOUGH TOOLS TO SUCCEED IN BOTH PROTECTING FARMLAND IN IN MAKING THAT LAND ACCESSIBLE TO SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS. AB NINE EIGHTY SIX PROVIDES A REALLY NOVEL VEHICLE TO ACCOMPLISH BOTH OF THOSE GOALS AT ONCE. SO QUICKLY -- A STORY ABOUT ONE OF THE CLIENTS THAT WE WORK WITH A KITCHEN TABLE ADVISORS -- HAVE YEAR WAS ABLE TO GROW HIS BUSINESS FROM LEASING ONE POINT FIVE ACRES TO PURCHASING A TWO HUNDRED ACRE RANCH A COUPLE YEARS AGO. FROM THE ONE POINT FIVE ACRES ON LEASE TO THE TWO HUNDRED ACRES HE NOW OWNS HAVE YOU EVER THE BEEN BENEFICIARY OF MULTIPLE WELL RESOURCE AND WELL ORGANIZED -- ENTITIES WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH ONE ANOTHER TO PROTECT FARMLAND AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE. NOW THE REASON WHY I HAVE YEARS SUCCESSFUL IS BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD FARMER AND HE'S A GOOD BUSINESSMAN HE JUST NEEDED THE ACCESS TO LAND. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A STRATEGY WAS USED -- THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS BY PROTECT CELL WHERE ONE OR MORE CONSERVATION ENTITIES POOL RESOURCES TO BUY THE LAND FEE TITLE PROTECTED WITH A CONSERVATION EASEMENT AND THEN SELL IT BACK TO A NEW FARMER. NOW IN OUR COUNTY AND IN MUCH OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU'RE REDUCING THE VALUE OF LAND BY PUTTING A CONSERVATION EASEMENT IT'S AT A RATE OF FIFTY TWO IN OUR COUNTY SO THIS IS AN OFTEN OVERLOOKED SIDE I THINK OF AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENTS THAT THE NOT ONLY PROTECTING THE LAND IN PERPETUITY THEY'RE ALSO PERMANENTLY REDUCING THE COST OF THAT LAND AND THEREFORE IT'S ACCESSIBILITY. SO IN MY WORK AT THE COUNTY I REGULARLY FIELD CALLS FROM -- SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS INTERESTED IN LEASING OR BUYING PROTECTED LAND AND FROM RETIRING FARMERS WHOSE KIDS DON'T WANT TO FARM AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MADE FINANCIALLY HOLE ON THEIR PROPERTY INVESTMENT BUT WITHOUT SEEING THEIR LAND DEVELOPED. SO GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH SPECULATIVE VALUATION OF FARMLAND IN OUR COUNTY AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA - MY PROGRAM CANNOT CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS -- NOT WITHOUT THIS HERCULEAN EFFORT OF COURT NATION AND A MOUNTAIN OF RESOURCES TO DO THAT BY PROTECTS TO SELL A STRATEGY. AB -- NINETY SIX WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO THAT IN OUR PROGRAM -- WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS -- AND HANDED OVER. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME'S OF AND AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- NINETY SIX ID COME FROM SANTA ANA I AM A MEMBER OF A WORKER COOPERATIVE -- THAT WE ARE WE'RE FOR MEMBERS AND WE FARM AND WE'VE BEEN FARMING OUT OF FOR THREE YEARS IN THE BACK OF A LOT IN IT WHICH WE BORROW FROM A CHURCH. AND SAW -- DONE THE WAY THAT OUR MISSION WITH THE CHURCH IS BASICALLY A MONTH TWO MONTHS WITH -- BASICALLY IF IT'S NOT FOR THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT WE HAVE WITH THE WITH THE CHURCH LIKE THEY MIGHT NOT BE THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT FARMING NEXT MONTH ANYMORE YOU KNOW. AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE IN OUR SITUATION -- THE FOCUS OF MY OF MY A TESTIMONY TODAY -- WILL BE ON THE SPIRITS OF SANTANA ASYLUM -- AGRICULTURAL -- ASPIRING FARMERS -- HOW ARE WE TRYING TO ACQUIRE LAND AND THE OBSTACLES -- TO GET IT. AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SANTANA BUT IT'S SITUATED IN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S IN THE MIDDLE ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO -- IT'S A COMMUNITY THAT FOR GENERATIONS HAS BEEN -- US ON CULTURAL STRONGHOLD OF MEXICAN CULTURE. AND SO -- FOR MEAN IT MANY OF US WHO MIGRATED -- TWO SANTANA IT'S IT'S A PLACE THAT WE CALL HOME IT'S LIKE OUR HOME AWAY FROM HOME AND SO IT'S THE THE THE FOOD. THE MUSIC EVERYTHING HAS BEEN. THE MANNERISMS OF THE PEOPLE IT'S A IT'S A GOOD. OUR COMMUNITY TO BE IN IN A COMMUNITY THAT WE LOVE -- SOMETHING IS ALSO A PLEASE THAT'S VERY HARD TO LIVE -- BASICALLY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RARE FOR OUR FAMILIES TO LIVE -- MANY FAMILIES IN ONE APARTMENT OR IN A HOUSE -- THIS IS BECAUSE THE THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY IS REALLY HIGH [inaudible] AND SO -- MANY OF THE THE ARE ARE CONTEXT OF LIVING A FORCES US TO COME TOGETHER NOW AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER AROUND HOUSING ISSUES. IMMIGRATION ISSUES AND IN OUR CASE -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD WE CREATED THOUGHT COOPERATIVE TO A GIRL FOOD -- FOR OUR OUR NEIGHBORS AND OURSELVES. SOLO BUT THIS -- BUT THIS WAY A OF THE THE OBSTACLES THAT I I OF THE IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IT APPLIES TO US. AND IN MANY CASES IT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE MANY OF US DON'T HAVE -- PROPERTY OR ANY ASSETS THAT -- THAT WE CAN COME UP FOURTH AND SAW. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- A LAND SHOWS THAT WAS CREATED WAS A MAN TOOL. TO CREATE A STRATEGY FOR OUR FARMERS AND COMMUNITY PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE. TO HAVE ACCESS TOOL -- LAND TO OWN IT. AND SO -- THIS HAS AT THIS IT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND SINCE THEN -- ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO COMING TOOL ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CITY FOR ONE BACON Là -- SOME OF THE OBSTACLE HAS BEEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY **** TOOL SHOW FOR AND SO WE CAN GET A LOAN. AND SO THAT HAS KINDA LIKE EXTENDED OUR NEGOTIATIONS TOOL TO THIS POINT. IT'S NOT FOR SURE WHETHER WE'RE GONNA GET IT BUT THE POINT IS THAT -- WITHOUT THOSE ASSETS -- IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE -- TO BE ABLE TO GET A CAR THAT LINE. AND SO. I THINK. ONE OF THE MAIN POINT IS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO REMARK IS THAT -- IT'S THE IT'S THE IT'S THAT FIRST -- FOOT A FOOT IN THE DOOR. SO WE NEED WE NEED THAT SUPPORT -- TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR BECAUSE ONCE WE HAVE LAND WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT. AND KEEP GROWING THE LET A TO BE ABLE TO A SECURE LAND IN SOMETHING ELSE SO THAT WE CAN NOT PRESERVE IT. OUT OF THE SPECULATIVE MARKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE BEGIN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. PLEASE JUST NAME AND AFFILIATION NOTHING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER FOR THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPEN SPACE THIRTY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALL TOWERS WITH THE COMMUNITY LINES WITH FAMILY FARMERS AND THE CALIFORNIA FOOD AND FARMING NETWORK IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KATIE PATTERSON WITH AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST THANK YOU. REBEKAH MARKETS REPRESENTING CARBON CYCLE INSTITUTE AND STRONG SUPPORT. ERNESTO MAYES A WHAT THE NATIONAL FARMERS COALITION FIRMLY CAN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AARON RODRIGUEZ WITHIN IN A CONCERNED SCIENTISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. I NOTICED SO WELL WITH THE RIGHTS AND SANTA ANA CLT. THANK YOU. ON OCCASION. OF MEDIA ALLIANCE FOR AGROECOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA FROM JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN CAMERA READY WITH SUSTAINABLE CONNERY'S LAWCENTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THE BODIES BEGIN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY. BUT I'M SURE MEMBERS TO THE RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FROM YOUR WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION -- BUT AT AT THE PLEASURE OF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO SORT OF OFFER SOME OF OUR CONCERNS THAT WE DO HAVE WITH THE BILL. AND SO I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST I I WANT TO SAY WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THE BILL THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE. REAL ISSUES TO ACCESSING CAPITAL TO PURCHASE OR TO LEASE LAND. AND TO LACKS SOME OF THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF THE TECHNICAL KNOW HOW ON HOW TO UNDERSTAND AG FINANCING I THINK. DOES HAVE COMPLETE VALUE IN HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THAT ISSUE -- BUT I THINK PRACTICALLY WE DO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH -- HOW THE BILL IS CRAFTED THAT WE LOVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ON I THINK? FIRST AND FOREMOST BEYOND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A SEPARATE GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. FOR AMONG OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ACQUIRE ACLAND HOLD ITS PLACE UNDER AN AGRICULTURAL EASEMENT AND THEN EITHER IDENTIFY. A SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE FARMER RANCHER TO LEASE THAT LANDS OR TWO THEN ACQUIRE THAT LAND AS WELL OR TO TRANSFER THE FEE TITLE [inaudible] I'M. I THINK IT. WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE PERSPECTIVE THAT. THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THIS GRANT RECIPIENTS OF A COUNTY OR A CITY IN IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE. TO ACQUIRE WHAT ONCE WAS PRODUCTIVE ACLAND AND WITH NO MANDATE TO MANAGE THAT LAND INTERMITTENTLY WHILE THEY FIND THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS RANCHER WE HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS THAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO ATLANTA BEING TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTIVITY. THERE'S ALSO NO TIMELINE ON WHEN THAT TRANSFER INSTANCE TO HAPPEN SO IT COULD BE A MUCH LONGER SITUATION I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT. FEE TITLE ACQUISITION. ATTY EASEMENT CONTRACTS ARE COMPLICATED I THINK WE THE SPONSORS ECHOED THAT SENTIMENT -- AND SO WITHOUT THOSE PARAMETERS IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE ANTITHETICAL A FACT THAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO. I BEYOND THAT THE BILL ALSO DOESN'T HAVE. ANY CONSIDERATION THAT THAT THE LAND THAT'S REQUIRED BY THAT GRANT RECIPIENTS IS PRODUCTIVE ATLANTA SO IT COULD BE NON PRIME LAND WHICH IS. NOT THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS OR RANCHERS TO FIND -- ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY THERE'S NO STANDARD THAT THERE BE WATER AVAILABILITY ON THAT LANDS WHICH EVERY FARMER I THINK DEALS WITH NOW IN THIS CLIMATE -- OR THAT IT'S THE APPROPRIATE SIZE THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE A TRULY PRODUCTIVE -- ACT PLOT -- I I'M WORRIED THAT WITHOUT THESE PARAMETERS PUT IN A SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE DISADVANTAGE FARM AND RANCH RIGHT RANCHER WHO IS. DISENFRANCHISED TO BEGIN WITH IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD AN OPPORTUNITY IS THIS IS YOUR WAY TO BREAK INTO FARMING AND RANCHING OR TO ELEVATE YOURSELF -- WITH LAND THAT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR CONSIDERATION. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK WE HAVE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE AYE CONSERVATION EASEMENT PIECE OF THAT SWEET WHOLEHEARTEDLY AS AS FARM BUREAU AGREE THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROTECTED -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN FUNDS OR WE CAN MODIFY THERE'S LOTS OF PROGRAMS THAT EXIST BUT THAT LOCALLY. PRIVATELY AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL -- WHIMS ENACT SALTS CFC PIECE FARM LOAN PROGRAMS THAT ALL CAN SERVE THIS PURPOSE AND WE CAN PRIORITIZE THESE FOLKS IN THOSE PROGRAMS. SO WE ASK THAT WE FUND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WE LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS FIRST BEFORE CREATING SOMETHING NEW SO ONCE AGAIN WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH OF THEM AND I APOLOGIZE FOR OUR LATE -- CONSIDERATIONS BUT WE DID FEEL AS THOUGH THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE WORTHY OF HAVING IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THE NEXT OKAY -- THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE BEGIN OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL TODAY OKAY. THE QUESTION COMES FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I'M FOR OFFERING THIS BILL I JUST WANT TO IT. THERE'S AN ARTICLE TODAY IN THE PAPER REGARDING -- HOW ARE FARMING FAMILIES ARE FALLING APART AND NOT WANTING TO GO BACK TO THE FAMILY FARM? AND OUR FARMERS ARE GETTING OLDER. ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN GIVE FARMERS TO HAVE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES TO HAVE DISADVANTAGED FAIL -- FARMERS COME IN AND MAYBE LEASE THE LAND OR BY THE LAND -- I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY -- I APPRECIATE HOW HARD YOU WORK TO TRY TO GET THIS ALL TO WORK. I KNOW YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS -- AND I APPRECIATE IT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE FARM BUREAU HELPS OUT. AND COMES TO THE TABLE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT TO HELP OUT OUR FARMERS OF THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE DO NEED MORE FARMERS. AND SOMETIMES THERE IS A DISCONNECT -- WITH SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT JUST POINTING OUT FARM YOUR WITH OTHERS THAT SHOULD BE HELPING OUT ALL ALONG. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR BILL AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. TAKE IT AS A MOTION. THAT WOULD BE YEP. THANK YOU IT'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR MR MATHIS MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU -- MISTER USA APPRECIATE THE TIME SPEAKING WITH YOU I THINK YOUR BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT BILL -- UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK ALL THE PIECES ARE THERE YET -- I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU TO GET IT TO WHERE I BELIEVE IT TO THE NEEDS TO BE THERE THAT WAY ARE PEOPLE WHO. ARE TRYING TO STEP OUT OF POVERTY AND GET INTO AGRICULTURAL ACTUALLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE GOOD LANDS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS PUT TOGETHER RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT SELLING THEM HOPES AND DREAMS -- THAT ARE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW WHERE THE TO BE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GROW ANYTHING -- SO FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA LAY OFF -- VERSES OPPOSING YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT I WOULD LIKE A SOLID COMMITMENT FROM YOU -- TO WORK WITH THIS TO ENSURE THAT -- ALL THE RIGHT PIECES GET PUT INTO THIS SO IT'LL ACTUALLY BE EQUITABLE ON TO ENSURE THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK RIGHT -- MOVING FORWARDS THESE PEOPLE CAN TRULY BE TAKEN CARE OF AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE A BRIEF. CONVERSATION ABOUT IT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU YOU KNOW I MASS YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY. MAIL.
