BUT THEY STILL CAN CHARGE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES COPAYS THAT CAN RANGE FROM FORTY DOLLARS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A FIVE YEAR STUDY CONDUCTED BY UCS HALF OF THE ONE THOUSAND WOMEN SEEKING ABORTION CARE AT THIRTY FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOUND THAT OVER. HALF OF THE WOMEN HAD OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE THIS IS A MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THEIR- IN. THESE HIGH OF POCKET COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO CARE TO THE CARE THAT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BELLA GALLIMORE AND I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY AND MEDICAL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT I WAS PREGNANT- THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD LIVING TO MY FIRST GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHICH HAD ALREADY COST ME MY JOB AND SOCIAL LIFE. I THOUGHT IN NO WAY PREPARED TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A CHILD DURING SUCH UNCERTAIN TIMES AND I MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE AN ABORTION. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL CLINIC AND MENTALLY PREPARED FOR THE EXPERIENCE I WOULD UNDERGO. BUT I COULD NOT PREPARE FOR IT WITH THE FINANCIAL BARRIER I FACE WHEN ACCESSING MY PORTION. ON THE DAY OF MY APPOINTMENT I LEARNED THAT UNDER MY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE POLICY I WOULD NEED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE THE PROCEDURE THAT DAY. THIS COST COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED ME AND I CONTEMPLATED HOW I COULD AFFORD THE PROCEDURE. IN ADDITION TO MY LIVING EXPENSES. I THEN UNDER. THAT OF URGENCY WITHOUT. ABORTION I KNEW THAT THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE. I WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION THAT DAY CAN I USE NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I HAD TO PAY FOR MY ABORTIONS. AFTER PAYING FOR THE PROCEDURE I WENT TO MY CAR. AND I THOUGHT FOR MYSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO KNEW THE DISTRESS CAUSED BY FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTH CARE. AT THE MOST VULNERABLE TIME IN MY LIFE THE FINANCIAL BARRIER I STATE TO COST SHARING ALMOST PREVENTED ME FROM ACCESSING THE CARE THAT I NEED THAT. THE BURDEN OF THIS HIGH AND EXPECTED COST AFFECTED ME FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD. THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR COST OF MY ABORTION INTENSIFIED MY FINANCIAL TROUBLES CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND THE EXISTING STIGMA SURROUNDING ABORTION MANY FEEL ISOLATED AND VOICELESS. PEOPLE THAT I COULD UNDERGO A FACE AND LEGAL ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA. I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR ME. I RECOGNIZE NOW THAT THE TRONG MIND OR DO% TO COST SHARING SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. I'M ASKING FOR SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL CHIU FORTY FIVE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THE OTHER CALIFORNIANS WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THE SAME FINANCIAL BARRIER I THINK WHEN I COULD SEE MY PORTION. THANK YOU TO SHARE MY STORY TO SERVE AS A AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

FIFTY TWO FORTY FIVE WILL FORCE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PAY FOR ABORTION FREE OF CHARGENO DEDUCTIBLES NO CO PAYS. CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES ALL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS TO COVER ABORTION THIS BILL FORCES INSURANCE TO PICK UP THE TAB AS WELL. THE BILL'S PREFERENCE FOR FREE ABORTIONS OVER OTHER TYPES OF HEALTH CARE IS INCONSISTENT SEXIST DISCRIMINATORY AND DOUBLE DOWN ON CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SB TWO FORTY FIVE IS INCONSISTENT WHY STOP AT ABORTION COPAYS. WHY NOT FORCE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ABSORB COPAYS FOR OTHER WOMEN'S HEALTH TREATMENTS LIKE PAP SMEARS HYSTERECTOMIES OR FERTILITY TREATMENTS OR EVEN CANCER AND IT'S SEXIST. WHY NOT COVER MEN'S REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES LIKE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION OR PROTECTING THE REVERSAL AND WHAT ABOUT SIX CHANGE OPERATIONS WHY IS ABORTION FREE FOR ALL. SB TWO FORTY FIVE IS DISCRIMINATORY MOST PREGNANCIES DO NOT END IN ABORTION SB TWO FORTY FIVE DOES NOT REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PAY FOR THE COST OF GIVING BIRTH. EFFORTS TO ADOPT IT SELECTIVELY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FAMILIES AND WOMEN. WHO WANT TO GIVE BIRTH. SB TWO FORTY FIVE VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW. WELL AMENDMENT CLEARLY STATES THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COVER OR PAY FOR ABORTIONS. FLOUTING THIS FEDERAL LAW CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR ABORTION SB TWO FORTY FIVE DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW TO SELECTIVELY REDISTRIBUTE FUNDS FROM PRIVATE COMPANIES. TO ABORTION PROVIDERS IN A BID TO ADVANCE A SOCIALIZED MEDICAL CARE PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE A NO VOTE ON SB TWO FORTY FIVE THANK YOU.

SOMEONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT SUBURBAN ANALYSIS- AVAILABLE SO WITH THAT I SEE A CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA THANK US SENATOR CONSOLES FOR BRINGING THE MEASURE FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TO BE A- CIBLE JOINT AUTHOR. IT'S ONE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS- THE FIRST OPPOSITION WITNESS CALLED THE BILL SEXIST. I DON'T KNOW HOW COULD BE SEXIST WHEN ONLY WOMEN CAN GET PREGNANT I DON'T THINK A MAN CAN HAVE AN ABORTION. THEN I ALSO ALWAYS WANT TO CORRECT FOLKS WHO REFERRED TO THE ABORTION INDUSTRY THERE IS NO ABORTION INDUSTRY. ABORTION IS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED BY A DOCTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT AND NO ONE IS ASKING YOU PERSONALLY TO HAVE AN ABORTION. BUT THIS BILL MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN WHO TO MAKE THAT CHOICE HAVE IT PAID FOR AND IT IS NOT. ANOTHER OBSTACLE FOR THEM SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT AND WILL VOTE. ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN ALL RIGHTS SUPPORT- BILL IT'S A STRONG MOVE TOWARDS NOT CHEST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS IN NAME BUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS IN PRACTICE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAD THIS GROUND BREAKING RULING AND NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOMEN HAVE AN ABSOLUTE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES AND MAKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. OVER THE YEARS IT'S A GRADUAL CHIPPING AWAY TO SIT OKAY WELL YOU HAVE THIS RIGHT ON PAPER. BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY EXERCISE IT. TO THE POINT WHERE THERE ARE STATES WHERE THEY MIGHT THERE MIGHT ONLY BE ONE OR TWO PROVIDERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE WHO PERFORM ABORTION SERVICES. AND SO PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A LOWER INCOME- ONE MAN OR SOMEONE WHO SIMPLY CAN'T TAKE TIME TO TRAVEL SIX HOURS YOU CAN ACCESS. ABORTION SERVICES WE SHOULD BE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I CALIFORNIA I'M BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS- TO WOMEN NOT BEING ABLE TO ABSOLUTELY CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES AND THEIR OWN LIVES AND NOT HAVE OTHER PEOPLE MAKE THOSE CHOICES. FOR THEM- AND WE KNOW THAT IT HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL- COPAYS AND- I DID. ALTHOUGH THIS AND NOT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THEM GENERALLY. CAN HAVE PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS. IN TERMS OF COST BURDENS AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW A FIVE DOLLAR COPAY. WHEN YOU GO TO PICK UP MEDICINE AT THE STORE AT THE PHARMACY THIS CAN BE VERY SIGNIFICANT COST SHARING REQUIREMENTS THAT. THAT'S JUST PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ODD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND I'LL BE GOING ON. THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SO WE HAVE. I THINK ALL WE HAVE A- I THINK CERTAIN THINGS COME TO MIND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HEALTH CARE WHAT IS HEALTH CARE IT'S GETTING CANCER TREATMENT IT'S GETTING YOUR COVERED TESTING IT GETTING YOUR EYES EXAMINED IT'S A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS IT DOES NOT COME TO MY MIND. IS AN ELECTIVE SURGERY THAT TAKES THE LIFE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SO I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY THE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO REFER TO ABORTION AS HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT'S NOT HEALTH CARE IT'S AN ELECTIVE SURGERY- IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT IS AN ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY AND JUST LIKE IF SOMEONE. GOES TO- HAVE THEIR NOSE FIXED- LASER EYE SURGERY OR YOU KNOW PICK SOME OTHER TYPE OF ELECTIVE SURGERY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT THERE ARE CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING THAT TYPE OF SURGERY BECAUSE IT IS AN ELECTIVE SURGERY. SAID GIVEN THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL BURDENS THIS STATE HAS EXPERIENCED JUST OVER THE LAST YEAR NOT TO MENTION IN. YOU KNOW PREVIOS YEARS IN THE FUTURE OF. THE TYPES OF THINGS WE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR AND HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THEM. ALL REASONABLE COSTS- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD THE AS A STATE SHOULD BE FORCING PEOPLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES THAT THEY ONLY AND DON'T AGREE WITH EITHER FROM A MORAL OR RELIGIOUS SPACE PERSPECTIVE. BUT ALSO SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO PAY FOR- THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT COMES ALONG AND I THINK IF SOMEONE MAKES- THE CHOICE. TO HAVE AN ABORTION THAT IS THEIR CHOICE BY LAW BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT- I FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THOSE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT CHOICE BECAUSE AGAIN. THIS IS AN ELECTIVE SURGERY- THIS IS THIS IS DOES NOT FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY- OF HEALTH CARE IS WE ORDINARILY WOULD CONSIDER IT SO I- WOULD REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MELENDEZ ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING NONE AYE I WOULD- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY FIRST OF ALL AND I HAVE BEEN AND I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT BUSH IS NOT HEALTHCARE IT IS HEALTH CARE AS A PHYSICIAN I WILL SAY THAT IT IS HEALTH CARE- THERE'S A ROLE FOR COST SHARING. THE RAND- INSURANCE STUDIES SHOWED THAT. BUT THEY'RE ALSO PLACES WHERE CARSHARING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND- WITHOUT ELABORATING ON A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IN FACT ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE COST SHARING FOR PREVENTATIVE SERVICES THERE'S- FOR OTHER TYPES OF. HIS AS WELL AND IN MY MIND I ALSO THINK THAT- COST SHARING FOR. THIS FORM OF HEALTH CARE- PORTION SERVICES. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TIME ISSUES AS WELL- THAT SAID THAT. THAT THE PATIENTHAS TO DEAL WITH- IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND- AND I THINK IT DID. BECAUSE AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- CENTER GONZALEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK OUR CO SPONSORS- ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CALLED AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR- EFFORTS IN THIS AND CONTINUING TO BE OF A LOUD VOICE FOR- WHAT I'LL SAY ISN'T. EVENFURTHER HEALTH CARE EQUITY FOR. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS WHY MANY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS LIKE MY OWN AND IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH OF CREATED. BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY BLACK MOTHERS ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO PASS AWAY FROM PREGNANCY. RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE MOTHERS THEY SUFFER FROM LOWER BIRTH RATES. ARE LOWER- BIRTH WEIGHTS AND WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THIS SPACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED ALL THE WAY AROUND AND THAT THEY DON'T- HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO THEIR- ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FREEDOMS. SO WITH THAT I ASK THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THINK AGAIN OUR SPONSORS. THANK YOU A IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. OKAY CENTER LAY ALL RIGHT SO THE BILL'S BEEN VICE. LEYVA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS A MAY. AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AND I THINK YOU DID SAY YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS RIGHT. YES YES OKAY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY SEPT IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE POLICY COMMENT IN THE ANALYSIS. B. IN THESE AMENDMENTS ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE OF A PILOT PROGRAM TAKEN EFFECT. SB FOUR ZERO TWO DIRECT HEALTHCARE PAYERS PURCHASERS PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH CARE CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES TO COME TO THE TABLE UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. TO COLLABORATE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MULTI PAYER PAYMENT REFORM PILOTS FOR CERTAIN FEE FOR SERVICE PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT INVESTING IN PRIMARY CARE PROMOTES HEALTH EQUITY IMPROVES PATIENT OUTCOMES AND EXPERIENCES. INCREASES THE SUPPLY OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND REDUCES HEALTHCARE SPENDING. AN ADEQUATE ACCESS. HAS BEEN FUELED BY PROVIDER CARE PAYMENT MODEL THAT IS NOT STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT AND CANNOT SUSTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM WHICH IS PATIENT CENTERED COORDINATED COMPREHENSIVE IN VALUE BASED. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL VIABILITY WITHOUT THEM MARKET POWER AND RESOURCES HELD BY THEIR LARGER COUNTERPARTS. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE TO TRAVEL FARTHER FOR CARE THAN THEIR URBAN COUNTERPARTS. IF THE COST TO OPERATE BECOMES TOO MUCH FOR THESE PRACTICES THEY USE. TO BEAR AND THEY ARE FORCED TO CLOSE. THE DISTANCE WILL INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY. SUCH PRACTICES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BUT IN SMALLER RURAL AREAS LIKE THOSE OF MY DISTRICT. THEY ARE SOMETIMES THE CLOSEST OR ONLY PROVIDERS THAT USE THEM SB FOUR ZERO TWO SIX TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IN AREAS HIT HARDEST BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BY GETTING PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND PAYERS TOGETHER TO FORM A MULTI PAYER PAYMENT REFORM COLLABORATIVE. IT ALSO ESTABLISHES PILOT PROGRAMS THATMOVE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BEFORE SERVICE PRIMARY CARE.

CURRENT LAW ALLOWS EDT TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH ALMOST THREE DOZEN STATE AGENCY AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AGENCIES IN OTHER STATES BUT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING OUTREACH ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SB SIX FORTY FOUR WOULD CHANGE THAT BY ALONE EDT TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA FOR THIS EXACT PURPOSE AND WILL ALSO PROTECT PRIVACY BY ENSURING THIS INFORMATION STAY WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA. IF COVER CALIFORNIA HAD CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ALL UNEMPLOYMENT APPLICANTS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CONDUCT PROACTIVE AND TARGETED OUTREACH TO A POPULATION THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY BENEFIT FROM INFORMATION ON COVERAGE INCLUDING BOTH COVERED CALIFORNIA AND MEDIC CAL AS WE ALL KNOW HERE IN AMERICA JOBS AND HEALTH INSURANCE FOR OFTENTIMES CLOSELY LINKED IF A PERSON LOSES THEIR JOB THEIR OFTENTIMES FACED BY LOSING THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR BOTH THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSS AND DROPS IN INCOME. BUT DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC BOTH MEDIC CAL AND COVERED CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPERIENCED LOWER THAN EXPECTED ENROLLMENT THE LATEST MEDICARE WON'T COVER CALIFORNIA DATA SUGGESTS THAT SOME CALIFORNIANS ARE CHOOSING TO GO WITHOUT COVERAGE OR NOT GETTING CONNECTED WITH THE BEST COVERAGE OPTIONS IN SHORT THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE WELLS AVOID COSTLY AND DANGEROUS GAPS IN THEIR CARE WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS RONALD. COLEMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HELLO THE WORK AND DOUGLAS WITH HEALTH ACCESS MEMBERS WHEN APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND LEAD TO UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSS IN DROPS IN INCOME WITH EDP REPORTING THAT ONE POINT THREE MILLION MORE CALIFORNIANS FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT SURE. WITH THE WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR YOUNGER AND LESS EDUCATED WORKERS EXPERIENCING DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF JOB LOSS IN THE STATE. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC SHOWS THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE AND ENSURING OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES DON'T SLIP THROUGH OUR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET. AB SEAT AND WE KNOW LOSS OF JOB BASED HEALTH COVERAGE CAN EXACERBATE DISPARITIES AND LEAD TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES DUE TO CULVERT NINETEEN RELATED ILLNESS OR OTHER DELAYED CARE. THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE UNINSURED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND DUE TO SYSTEMIC RACISM INEQUALITY BASED. DIABETES AND OTHER CONDITIONS AT HIGHER RATES DUE TO DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE JOBS AND HOUSING CONDITIONS WE BELIEVE LOSING YOUR JOB SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN LOSING YOUR HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CAN ENSURE OUR STATE AGENCIES SHARE INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH COVERAGE OPTIONS BETTER RIGHT FOR THEM. SB SIX FOUR FOUR WILL ENSURE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED THE COVERAGE THROUGH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MARKETING OUTREACH ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE INCLUDING FROM TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED NAVIGATOR.

CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL OR ABOUT EIGHTY NOT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND ALSO COVERED CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. WHICH IS WHAT THE NATION IN AFFORDABILITY. HOWEVER ONE OF THE BIGGEST REMAINING HURDLE TO COVERAGE BESIDES AFFORDABILITY IS LACK OF AWARENESS OF YOUR COVERAGE OPTIONS. ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE TRANSITIONS EMPLOYMENT INCOME MANY ARE UNAWARE OF WHAT THEIR BEST COVERAGE OPTIONS ARE OR EVEN WHERE TO TURN FOR AT THE- START. RIGHT NOW PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FROM EATING WITH THE WEATHER CHECK THE NOTICE FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA ON THEIR INSURANCE OPTIONS. HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE NOTED TAT THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING BENEFITS AND ONLY ONCE THEY'VE. ACTUALLY STARTED TO GET THE BENEFIT. ANYMORE PEOPLE TO EIGHTY BUT OUR I COVER.

BUT BOTH OF THOSE WHO HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT THEIR BENEFITS OR WHO HAVE HAD THEIR WORK HOURS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. ITS ONLY WILL COVER CALIFORNIA TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING EMPLOYMENT TRANSITION TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF ALL THEIR OPTIONS. AND ALSO NOTABLY THE MEDIC CALLUM COVERED CALIFORNIA USED THE SAME APPLICATION IT WILL SERVE THE DUAL PURPOSE OF CONNECTING PEOPLE AND NOT A CAL AS WELL.

ANYWHERE FROM HOUSING TO FOOD AND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL THAT WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS IT'S NOT JUST THEIR JOB THEY'RE LOSING IT IS THE RESOURCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEIR HEALTH CARE BUT ALSO MORE IMPORTANT THEIR PEACE OF MIND THERE IS A PEACE OF MIND KNOWING THAT YOU ARE COVERED AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOES A GREAT JOB AND STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND JUST MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM.

WISH TO TAKE THE GAVEL OR AT LEAST FIGURATIVELY CERTAINLY- WELCOMES SENATOR PAN YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL YOUR FIRST BILL WHICH IS SB THREE ZERO SIX. THANK YOU. AND I'M CHAIR- MEMBER- SENATORS- WE ARE AT A CRISIS POINT WHEN IT COMES TO STD INFECTIONS THIS COUNTRY SO WELL WE ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING COVE IN NINETEEN- ACTUALLY. FOR MANY YEARS WE'VE BEEN SEEING A STEADY RISE AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN FACT THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN UNITED STATES HAVE A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALMOST SIXTY EIGHT MILLION STD INFECTIONS REPORTED AND RATES OF SYPHILIS CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA ARE UP FORTY PERCENT. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. CALIFORNIA HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST SYPHILIS RATES IN THE NATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN FACT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SURPLUS RATE AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE INCREASED BY AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA KELLY CALIFORNIA YOUTH PEOPLE OF COLOR AND GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. OVER HALF OF ALL STDS IN THE STATE ARE REPORTED AMONG YOUTH AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE 5100% MORE LIKELY CONTRACT HONORING CHLAMYDIA THAN A WHITE COUNTERPARTS AND THESE DISPARITIES ARE EXPECTED TO WORSEN AS A RESULT OF THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ONE OF THE HARDEST DATA POINTS. FOR ME TO SQUARE HAS TO DO WITH THE RATES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS A DISEASE I THOUGHT WE GOT RID OF WITH THE VICTORIAN ERA. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BABIES WERE BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN CALIFORNIA AND 9100% INCREASE FROM TWENTY TWELVE. THAT YEAR THERE WERE TWENTY STILLBIRTHS ASSOCIATE WITH THE DISEASE. AND HALF OF CAN GIO SYPHILIS CASES OCCUR BECAUSE OF GAPS IN TESTING AND TREATMENT DURING PRENATAL CARE THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE THAT GAP BY REQUIRING ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS. THE BILL ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT BY OPENING UP ACCESS TO THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM INCREASING THE USE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPEDITED PARTNER THERAPY OPTION BY PROVIDERS AND PHARMACISTS. FOR MANY HIV COUNSELOR SAID MILLER'S ADMINISTER RAPID STD TESTS AND REQUIRING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOME STD TESTS. CALIFORNIA'S UNFORTUNATELY LAGGED IN ENACTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES TO INCREASE ACCESS STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT. AND THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED STD RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH EVERYONE STAYING AT HOME IN THE PAST YEAR CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WILL BE HAPPENING IN THE COMING YEAR. SB THREE OH SIX TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S STD CRISIS BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO STD CARE AND ALCOHOL WAY ESPECIALLY ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE.

DO YOU KNOW THAT MY PATIENTS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS TODAY HAVE A 40% HIGHER CHANCE CONTRACT THE SURPLUS AND THEY DID JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU ALSO KNOW THAT THESE INJECTIONS HIT BOTH THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY HARD.

THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- SOMEPLACE PERCENT SB FIVE TEN TWO WHICH ADDRESSES- COST SHARING FOR A COVERED NINETEEN- TESTING AND VACCINATIONS I'VE ONE BEGIN BY. I THINK COMMITTEE TO ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE THE MOCK UP WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY THE PART INSURANCE THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE FOLLOWING EXCLUDE SPECIALIZED HEALTH PLANS INSURANCE POLICIES INSURANCE POLICIES COULD BE EXPECTED BENEFITS SO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHOIR DENTAL PLANS VISION PLANS COVER THIS- CLARIFY- COVERAGE FOR TESTING AND SERVICES NECESSARY FOR FURNISHING IMMUNIZATIONS AND CLARIFY THE FUTURE FRAMEWORK THAT APPLIES WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECLARES PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE DISEASE. SO SB FIVE TEN REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS INSURERS COVER COVER COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATION WITHOUT COST SHARING A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM BOTH IN NETWORKING OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS DURING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THESE PROTECTIONS ARE EXTENDED TO IN NETWORK PROVIDERS FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBITS BALANCE BILLING BY PROVIDERS FOR COVER NINETEEN TESTING IMMUNIZATIONS EVEN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE CAN ALREADY TAKE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND PUT A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE TO ALLOW FEDERALLY APPROVED TESTING ANY MUSICIANS WITH NO COST SHARING FOR FUTURE PANDEMIC. FEDERAL STATE AGENCIES HAVE SENT OUT OF ALL THE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING GUIDANCE WHICH IS MADE IT CONFUSING FOR PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS AND KNOW. WHAT WHEN AND WHAT THEY WILL BE CHARGED. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR TESTING SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC AND INDIVIDUALS ALONG WITH THOSE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN IS CRUCIAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD. THERE'S A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US BEFORE THE MAJORITY POPULATION CAN BE OURS WILLING TO BE VACCINATED. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY HEARD THAT GETTING TESTED IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF STOPPING THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN IN FACT- WE DON'T TEST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND US SO WE NEED THAT TO HAPPEN. WELL THE GENERAL FOCUS AND PRIORITIES ARE ENSURING EVERYONE CAN GET A VACCINE WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF ENSURING EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO COVERT NINETEEN TESTING. AND VACCINATIONS WITHOUT OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND THAT'S WHY SB FIVE TEN IS NEEDED NOW. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT LAWS REGARDING COVER NINETEEN TESTING IMMUNIZATIONS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS.

WITH TWO MINUTES. MISTER HAMPTON YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER WOULD CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE UNLESS IT IS AMENDED I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OPPORTUNITY BACK FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT OUR MEMBER OUTLANDER STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS ONE OF MY. BEING OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THE DAILY NEWS PUBLIC EMERGENCIES. I REMEMBER HOW TO TAKE INCREASE SEVEN TO THE BACK. TO HELP CURB SPREAD OF COLOR NINETEEN- HOUSE WE ARE CONCERNED- THE AT BY PIN. WE ALL MET LANGUAGE. THAT HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS ARE REQUIRED SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PER CODE NINETEEN WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE OFF RIGHT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND MINISTER TO RECRUITMENT ROWLEY PROTEST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO CREATE INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE RECENTLY RELEASED FEDERAL DIED IN THE CURRENT STATE REGULATIONS. A SPECIFICALLY THE UPDATED FEDERAL GUIDANCE WHICH WAS RELEASED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SIXTH OF THIS YEAR WE AFFIRM PREVIOUS FEDERAL GUIDANCE. THAT THAT THAT STATE THAT HEALTH PLANS INSURERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR TESTING BUT NOT USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES. I GENERALLY SPEAKING THE CRITICAL TESTING PER VERY FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR TREATMENT FOR COLD AT NINETEEN. WE BELIEVE THAT OMITTING THE IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE BILL COULD CAUSE CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION AMONG PATIENTS SEEKING ATTACK. A WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO BETTER ALIGN THE CURRENT FEDERAL BY. STATE REGULATION BY CLARIFYING THAT PLANTS RSPONSIBILITIES FOR COVERAGE OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. AMONG OTHER THINGS WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE FIGHT. TO RETROACTIVELY OBLIGATE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS ON THE POTENTIALLY LACASSE HERE FROM THE START OF THE FEDERALLY. DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. IN THIS EMERGENCY HAS CREATED BY TOWN PERCENT PROVIDER. WHICH IS WHY HEALTH PLAN SET UP TO MEET THEM BY PROVIDING. FIND THANK YOU FOR. WHERE HE BOUGHT A PROBE. HOWEVER ARE UNCLEAR THAT THE PERSON HOW DESPERATE PROJECTS PREVENT IF YOU. I WOULD ALL COME WORKING CONFINES OF EXISTING LAW. FOR THESE REASONS WE WERE OPPOSE SB AND UNLESS THERE'S A MAN. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK THE AUTHOR THE MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER HAD TO MISS MURDER IF YOU WOULD- OPENS OPENS. ONE LAW PLEASE. SPIKE IN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE WASHINGTON FROM BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES REGRETTABLY WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB FIVE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE. ALSO LIKE I CAN MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU SOME ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE VILLAGE DRAFTED. AT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OUR MEMBERS STEPPED UP EARLY TO WORK WITH BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TRACK ANY POTENTIAL BARRIERS THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE SPEAKING COVERED RELATED TESTING AND OR SERVICES. THIS IS CRITICAL OF THE. UNDERSTOOD AND ACKNOWLEDGED. AGING P. HAVE BEEN AND TREATED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE CURB CREDIT FOR THE NIGHT. I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE- ISSUE THE RIGHT THE RESPECT OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE AND GOVERNMENT CHARGES WERE NOTABLY OUT OF LINE WITH THE NORM. ON THE VARIANCE WE ARE CONCERNED I THINK BY TEN DOES NOT ESTABLISH A CLEAR METHODOLOGY OF REVERSING OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. CURRENTLY THE BILL REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO REIMBURSE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS FOR ALL PASSING ITEMS OR SERICES AT A REASONABLE RATE. UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S OFTEN MUCH DISAGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A REASONABLE RATE. WE WOULD RECOMMEND CONSIDERING THE MEDICARE RATE. AS AN APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE. WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT A REASONABLE MARKET BASED PRICING BENCHMARK OF THE TABLET. SIMILAR TO WHAT THE IRS HHS AND FEEL I'LL HAVE DONE REGARDING VACCINES WHILE ALSO ENSURING. AGAINST PRICE GOUGING WHICH AS I MENTIONED SADLY IT'S NOT BEEN AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. LASTLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS ADDRESSING FUTURE PANDEMIC CONTAINED IN THE BILL ARE PREMATURE. DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE NEXT GLOBAL PANDEMIC BOOKER AND BACHELOR THE DEFINING PARAMETERS FOR FUTURE PANDEMIC WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAPPENED PRACTICES TREATMENT OPTIONS THEIR VACCINES. AVAILABILITY WILL EXIT CONCERNING. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE. OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED MONSTER TO DRESS ARE CONCERNED. THAT THE BILL FOR IT TODAY.
