00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.583
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WITH

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:03.821
NEEDED DURING THESE TIMES BUT

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:06.357
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SHOWS US

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.293
THAT OUR SYSTEM IS CHANGEABLE.

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:09.827

THOUGH WE DO DO ALL IN BALLOTS

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.096
AT THE BEGINNING WE MADE IN THE

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.964
OPTION WE DID SOME PILOTS. AND

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:48.466
ALL THOSE THINGS YOU TO TRY SEE

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:53.838
IF THIS WORK. WE HAD A GOOD FOR.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.140
AND THAT WILL PUT WORKED AND I

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:57.875
WAS HONORED AS I IT COME IN THE

00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:00.244
AT PEOPLE IN ME TRACKING MY

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:03.648
VOTE THE SEA WHERE MY BALLOT

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.650
CLOSE TO DOUBLE WHAT IF

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:09.720
EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO IT. I

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.122
KNEW THAT WHERE IT CAME FROM.

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:13.124
IT CAME FROM THE SCHOOL THIS BY.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.992
THAT REALLY. IN ELECTIONS IN

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.461
THE FORWARD. AND SO WE HAD IN A-

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:18.763
EXPERIENCE I CAN REMEMBER WHEN

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.698
WE- WERE PUSH WITH THE- INFO.

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:25.069
PER OF A TWO. THAT WE OFTEN

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.705
HAVE A BODIES. WE GOT FIFTY.

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:32.977
YEARS COMMUNITIES GOT UP. TO

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.912
COMMITTEE. OF BASICALLY SET THE

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.714
FOUNDATION. AND WE HAD A GREAT

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.182
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH ALEX

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.784
IDEA BECAUSE HE'S HE STOPS OF

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.318
LAWSUITS AND SOME THINGS THAT.

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.586
BLACK PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WOULD

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:43.487
HAVE I WORK WITH HIM IN THE

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:44.855
BEGINNING. AND HE UNDERSTOOD

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:45.990
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.692
LEGISLATURE. AND HIS OFFICE AND

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.026
HOW WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:49.894
MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE DID

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.696
IT. AND SO I'M REALLY HONORED

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:53.497
THAT THAT WE LOOKED AT THE TURN

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:55.633
OUT. AND WE SAW TREMENDOUS

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.301
PROCESS PROGRESS IN THE IN THE

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:58.869
TURN OUT THAT WAS THE YEAR. AND

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.237
WILL CONTINUE THAT WE HAVE TO

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.706
CONTINUE IT. I KNOW PART OF THE

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:05.076
PART TURNOUT WAS THE FACT THAT

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:05.843
PEOPLE VOTING AGAINST SOMETHING.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.512
AND BODY HARD REPORT- AND

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:09.814
THAT'S A PART OF IT. BUT WE

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.915
SHOULD HAVE CRISIS AS THE

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.650
FOUNDATION FOR BASICALLY HAVING

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:14.652
TURNED OUT. AND I'M HOPING THAT

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.753
THROUGH THE SECRETARY OF

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.521
STATE'S OFFICE WE CAN BEGIN TO

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.090
TALK ABOUT CIVIC EDUCATION.

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:21.258
CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY. TO HELP

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.993
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND IF NOT

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:23.728
WE'LL TO PEOPLE AS WELL

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:26.363
UNDERSTAND. WHAT DEMOCRACY IS.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.866
HOW FRAGILE IT IS. AND HOW WE

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.034
HAVE TO PUT WORK TO MAINTAIN

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.802
IT. AND THAT VOTING AS THE

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.637
CENTRAL TO GET THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.239
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALREADY

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:36.507
LOOKING AT WORKING WITH OUR

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.441
SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:38.342
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:39.977
AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN PEOPLE

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:41.879
FAIL TO SHOW UP TO VOTE. AND

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:43.481
HOW PRECIOUS IT IS. AND HOW

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:44.682
IMPORTANT IT IS IN THIS

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:47.418
DEMOCRACY. TO MAINTAIN THAT. SO

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.452
WE DON'T WORK ON THOSE KINDS OF

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:49.153
ISSUES BUT WE SET THE

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.790
FOUNDATION AND WE WILL CONTINUE

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:53.390
TO WORK THAT FOUNDATIONS MAKE

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:54.191
IT HAPPEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:55.493
OUR BUSINESSES AND WORKING WITH

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:56.527
A BUSINESSES AND THAT'S

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.696
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I WHEN I

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.097
WAS IN AND SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.632
OFFICE WE HAVE ALMOST DIGITIZED

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:02.833
ALMOST EVERYTHING COMPUTERIZED

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.335
EVERYTHING. THAT WE HAVE EXCEPT

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.970
FOR A LITTLE BIT THAT'S LEFT.

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.104
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.572
WE'VE SEEN OUR BUSINESSES IN

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.941
THIS PANDEMIC FLOUNDER. AND NOT

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.076
HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.111
THEY NEEDED TO GROW. WE SEE NO

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.180
NONPROFITS DO THE SAME THING.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.214
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.016
PROCESS IT'S CLEAR. THAT IT'S

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.918
HELPFUL THAT IT SUPPORTED THAT

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:21.619
WE HAVE FOLKS WHO COULD HELP

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.420
THE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE SO FOR

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:24.388
SO MANY COMMUNITIES

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:26.023
PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.925
IS ALL THEY HAVE. FOR SO MANY

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.727
FAMILIES THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE.

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.462
AND SO WILL BEGIN TO WALK AWAY

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:33.030
FROM THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.932
FOR THEM TO SURVIVE. NOT ONLY

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.000
JUST FINANCIALLY BUT

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:38.068
EMOTIONALLY AND PERSONALLY. I

00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:39.436
TO INVEST IN WE HAVE IN SOME

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.604
COMMUNITIES THIRTY AND FORTY

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:43.007
YEARS. OF RESTAURANTS IN SOME

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:43.774
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TO

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.676
FOLD. IN THE THAT THAT IS THAT

00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:47.178
IS DEVASTATING TO A LEGACY OF

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:48.846
FAMILY. THAT IS STRUGGLE SO

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:49.914
HARD TO KEEP THOSE THINGS OPEN

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.482
AND SO WE HAVE A REALLY BIG

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.083
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.451
THAT OUR PROCESS IS CLEAR THAT

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.719
IT'S HELPFUL. AND WE CAN FIGURE

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.921
OUT WAYS TO WORK WITH OTHER

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.255
ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:58.322 --> 00:40:59.690
THOSE WHO ARE. ONCE AGAIN

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:00.791
TRYING TO GET THE LICENSE BACK

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.393
TRYING TO OPEN THE BUSINESSES.

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:03.494
THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:04.695
OFFICE IS THERE FOR THEM AS

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:06.163
WELL THE LARGE BUSINESSES WELL

SURVIVE. IS WILLING TO WORK ON

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:31.655
THOSE THINGS A LITTLE WORK ON.

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.324
ISSUES OF CYBERSECURITY REMAINS

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.092
ALWAYS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.127
SHOULD NEVER EVER OVERCOME. AND

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:38.896
YOU NEVER FINISHED. AND SO WILL

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.997
CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.165

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:55.613

JUST I KNOW THERE'S A CAN ABOUT.

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:04.655
IN THE CONTRACT THAT WAS GIVEN

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.957
AN- I I'VE TOLD SOMEONE THE

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:08.859
OTHER DAY I SIT DOWN THERE'S A

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.661
BET BENNETT TO DISADVANTAGE OF

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.896
BEING MARRIED TO A LAWYER FOR

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:13.497
TWENTY NINE YEARS. IS THAT HE

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:14.298
ALWAYS HAD A FREE PRETTY MUCH

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.366
FOR YOU SURELY DON'T GIVE LEGAL

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.467
ADVICE HE SAID BECAUSE YOU

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.668
DON'T PRACTICE LAW WITHOUT A

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.536
LICENSE THAT'S NUMBER ONE. AND

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:21.372
HE SAID NUMBER TWO IF YOU

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:23.173
COMMENT ON THE CASE BEFORE

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.377
THAT'S THAT'S BEING LITIGATED

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:26.977
YOU NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:28.045
THE CASE. AND SO UNLESS YOU

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:29.914
WANT TO BE A PARTY. TO THE

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.882
LAWSUIT. DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.284
JUST BASICALLY SAY YOU DON'T

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.852
HAVE ANY COMMENTS. BUT I CAN'T

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.453
SAY THAT I'VE LOOKED AT IT. I

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.355
LOOK AT IT FROM BOTH SIDES-

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.391
I'VE TALKED WITH NOT ONLY ALL

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:42.359
THE SECRETARY STATE FORM SECTOR

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.561
STATE. AND THE CONTROLLER. AND

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:45.462
I'VE LEARNED SOME THINGS ABOUT

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.564
WHAT WE NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY.

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.632
THE TRADITION IS NOT A WAY TO

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.200
DO BUSINESS. BUT THE LOSS THE

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.969
WAY TO DO BUSINESS. AND WILL

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.137
MAKE SURE THAT WE HANDLE THOSE

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:54.104
ISSUES AND ADDRESS THEM

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:54.538
APPROPRIATELY IN MY

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:55.439
UNDERSTANDING IS THERE

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.274
SOMETHING THAT WORKS NOW. BUT

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:58.943
AS WE GO FORWARD IT MIGHT MIGHT

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.978
ISSUES. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.880
WHAT WE DO IS WE GO FORWARD.

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:03.614
AND AS WE GO FORWARD WE WOULD

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:05.282
MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. U. S. A

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.350
LOT OF QUESTIONS YOU DIDN'T ASK

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.552
MUCH ABOUT ARCHIVES. BECAUSE I

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:09.086
GUESS YOU FIGURE THAT'S A

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.722
PRETTY SECURE- AND THAT'S AN

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:12.389
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:14.525
WHAT WE DO. SO AND YOU KNOW AS

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:15.259
I WAS THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THOSE

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:16.660
THINGS I SAID I HAVE ANSWERED

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:18.028
THE QUESTIONS. AND I COULD

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:18.996
PROBABLY GIVE YOU MORE

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.864
INFORMATION ABOUT EACH ONE OF

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:21.632
THOSE AS WE HAVE QUESTIONS THAT

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:26.103
ARE ASKED. BUT. I THINK WHAT

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:26.670
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHO IS-

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:27.304
WHO IS THIS ONE OF THE YOU WANT

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:28.839
AND- THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:31.442
OFFICE TO. WHAT SHE MADE UP

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:34.278
WHAT SHE BELIEVED BECAUSE IN

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:34.812
THE END THAT'S WHAT REALLY

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.847
MATTERS. THAT'S WHAT WILL

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:38.315
DECIDE THE DECISIONS THAT I

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.817
MAKE AND HOW ARE WORK WITH YOU

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.352
IN THE IN IN GOING FORWARD. YOU

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:42.619
KNOW THOSE THINGS THAT A CORE

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:45.255
VALUE TO ME. MOST OF YOU READ

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:46.790
MY RESUME AT SOME POINT IN YOUR

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:47.825
LIFE AND YOU DISCOVERED THAT I

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:50.661
HAVE A- FEW DEGREES FROM UCLA.

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.029
ABOUT TIME A TWENTY SIX OF THE

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.564
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR TWENTY

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.399
THREE BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:56.567
IN MY YEARS OF ADMINISTRATION

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:58.702
AND MY WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.204
AND MY WORK IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.105
WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:01.839
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.674
SHARECROPPERS. AND THIS IS AN

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.642
AWFUL LOT ABOUT MY LIFE. MY

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.211
FATHER WAS A SHARECROPPER HIS

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.679
FATHER WAS A SHARECROPPER IN

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.148
HOPE ARKANSAS. AND THEY LIVED

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:13.050
IN A LIFE THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:15.252
VERY LIMITED AND VERY SMALL.

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:16.653
BUT MY DAD WAS PROBABLY ALWAYS

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.423
PROBLEM. AND ALWAYS FOUGHT BACK

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.392
FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT MOVES JUST.

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.427
AND IN THE PROCESS OF THAT HE

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:25.429
ALMOST LOST HIS LIFE. SO IF

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.297
LEVEL ARKANSAS WHEN I WAS JUST

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.899
THIS THE BABY OF THE FAMILY.

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:31.869
AND LEVELS THERE. AND CAME TO

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:32.436
CALIFORNIA WITH MY MOTHER'S

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.105
MOTHER LIP. BECAUSE THEY WILL

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:35.639
WANT TO LYNCH HIM IN HOPE

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.775
ARKANSAS. AND SO WE CAME IN

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.743
CALIFORNIA BUT HE HAD CAME WITH

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.645
A LOT OF BELIEF AND A LOT OF

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.246
STRENGTH ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.081
TO FORCE FAMILY. AND IN THREE

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.115
MONTHS HE WORKED AND EARNED

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.083
ENOUGH TO PUT US ALL ON THE

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.618
TRAIN THAT WAS SIX CHILDREN

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.586
INTO IT MY MOTHER. ON A TRAIN

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:52.289
COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO LIVE

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.124
AND TO CREATE A LIFE. I LIVED

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.993
IN THE PUEBLOS THE PROJECTS OF

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.828
LOSS AND IS WHO FIRST BUILT.

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.129
WINDOWS SEVEN ELEMENTARY

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:01.265
SCHOOL. LIMITED RESOURCES. WE

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.366
HAD A FAMILY THAT WAS RICH IN

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.135
TRADITION AND RICH IN VALUES

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.805
THE REGION LOW. AND SO I GOT MY

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.673
FAMILY OF MY FAMILY SHARE

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.375
CROPPERS. BUT MY DAD BELIEVED

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.743
WHAT THEY TWO THINGS ONE I

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.645
BELIEVE IN EDUCATION. THE

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:15.212
SECOND THING YOU BELIEVE IN

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.214
VOTING. SO WHEN I BEGAN TO LOOK

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.482
AT THIS POSITION OF THE

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.851
SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID HOW

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.319
I FIT INTO THIS PICTURE YOU

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:23.720
KNOW WHAT MY VALUES IN

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.055
RELATIONSHIP TO THE WHAT'S

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:26.924
GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. AND I

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.593
REALIZE THAT ALL OF MY LIFE WE

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.327
HAVE WE HAD THE VALUE LOADING

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.496
IN MY FAMILY. NOT JUST GOING TO

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.865
THE POLLS. BUT WE HAD ACTUALLY

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:37.301
A POLL IN OUR HOUSE. MY LIVING

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.136
ROOM WAS THE PROOF WAS A VOTING

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:41.004
POLL VOTING PRECINCTS. AND THE

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.773
ADDRESS OF THREE FIFTY ONE WEST

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.274
FORTY FIFTH STREET PUBLISHED

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.943
TWENTY YEARS. IN LOS ANGELES

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:48.045
WAS A VOTING POLL. MY MOTHER MY

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:49.680
FATHER OPEN OUR HOME TO VOTING

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.115
BECAUSE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COULD

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.649
NO LONGER ACCOMMODATE. THE

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:53.984
VOTING ADVOCATE BECAUSE OF

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:56.120
LUNCH AND BREAKFAST BEING GIVEN

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.988
IN THE SCHOOL. WE HAD NO

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.957
LIBRARY CLOSED LAST WE HAD NO

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.359
REC CENTER. SO THE ONLY PLACE

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.927
WE HAD WAS SOMEONE TOLD. AND MY

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.496
FATHER SAID VOTING IS TO IMPORT

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.531
TO PUT IN THE GARAGE. SO I

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.465
REMOVED THE FURNITURE AT EVERY

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:10.367
ELECTION. AND PEOPLE VOTED IN

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.903
OUR LIVING ROOM. SO I GREW UP

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:13.470
WITH LOOKING AT PEOPLE VOTE

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.105
EVERY DAY. AND KNOWING THAT IT

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.273
WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.274
THE WORLD MY DAD SAID YOU COULD

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.609
DO BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT A

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:19.109
CHANCE TO VOTE IN HOPE

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:21.478
ARKANSAS. AND HIS DAD AND HIS

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:23.380
MOM NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO GO IN

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:26.150
THAT ENTIRE LIFE. BECAUSE THEY

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.484
DIED BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE.

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.052
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT IT I SAY

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.154
YOU KNOW I HAVE A PASSION ABOUT

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.722
VOTING. I DEMAND THAT ALL MY

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.257
CHILDREN BOTH MY NIECE MY

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.358
NEPHEW BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN MY

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:35.859
NEIGHBORHOOD- WHEN I WAS A

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.960
STUDENT I WOULD AS A PROFESSOR

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.162
THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU RUN OUT

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.429
OF MY CLASS AND ELECTION YOU

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.797
HAVE TO SHOW ME THE TAG TO GET

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.432
REGISTERED TO VOTE. IN ORDER TO

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.334
REMAIN IN MY CLASS. BECAUSE YOU

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:45.235
COULD NOT BE AN INTELLIGENT

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:47.404
PERSON AND NOT BUILT. AND SO AS

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.805
A RESULT THAT WAS EVERY STUDENT

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:49.873
KNEW THAT THEY HAD TO EITHER

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.942
REGISTER TO VOTE IF THEY WERE.

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.143
EIGHTEEN OVER. WHAT THEY HAD TO

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.344
HELP SOMEBODY ELSE REGISTER TO

00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:56.113
VOTE AND BRING ME THAT. THEIR

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.548
DOCUMENTATION THAT THEY HIT.

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:58.782
BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO

00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:59.383
UNDERSTAND THAT'S A PART OF

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:02.786
BEING AN AMERICAN. BEING ABLE

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:03.487
TO VOTE. I'M ALSO PROUD.

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:04.888
BELIEVER STRONGLY IN

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.290
BUSINESSES. BECAUSE I LOOK AT

00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:07.491
IT NOT JUST AS THE NUMBER

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.325
BUSINESSES WE HAVE IN THE

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.327
LARGER SENSE. BUT I LOOK AT THE

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:11.762
FACT THAT MY DAD WORKED EVERY

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:14.198
DAY. IN A FACTORY. AND FOR

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.666
THIRTY TWO YEARS HE DROVE BY.

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:17.367
FROM FROM LOS ANGELES TO. BUT

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.102
NOT DOWNTOWN LA ALL THE WAY TO

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.672
COMMERCE. AND HE SAW THE NUMBER

00:47:21.738 --> 00:47:23.307
OF BLACK A BUSINESSES GOING OUT

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:25.075
OF BUSINESS. EVERY YEAR. HE

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.144
WATCHED THE FIRESTONE'S IN THE

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.012
GOOD YEARS. AND THE BETHLEHEM

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.847
STEEL'S. LEAVE OP OUR

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:34.117
COMMUNITY. GOOD JOB THAT HE

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:34.885
WORKED IN A STEEL MILL HIMSELF.

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:35.986
AND HE SAW THE STRONG JOBS

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.087
LEAVING IN EVERY YEAR HE TALKED

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:39.556
ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING AWAY.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:40.357
SO THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.559
THREE WHEN HE RETIRED. IN IN

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.661
MARCH OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:45.862
IN JUNE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.798
THREE HIS FACTORY SHUT DOWN. HE

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:50.300
MISSED ABOUT TWO MONTHS. AND SO

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:51.401
HE I KNEW THAT WHEN AND WHAT

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:53.170
I'VE WITH A BUSINESS LEAVES

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.938
IT'S NOT JUST THE BOTTOM LINE

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.673
FOR CALIFORNIA. IT IS THE

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.675
BOTTOM LINE FOR PEOPLE. THE

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.677
PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FAMILIES ARE

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:01.812
DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.014
BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE IN THE

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:04.948
BUSINESS AND THE ABILITY OF

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:05.949
THOSE GOOD BUSINESSES TO

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.918
PROVIDE STABILITY FOR FAMILIES

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.686
AND FOR THEM TO GROW. AND SO

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:10.887
WHEN I THINK THE BUSINESS I NOT

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.689
ONLY THINK ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS.

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.991
I THINK IT WAS SMALL BUSINESSES

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:16.026
THE BEAUTY SHOPS THAT THE

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.928
BARBER SHOPS. THE RESTAURANTS

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:18.795

FAMILY HAVE OWNED FOR YEARS IN

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:22.666

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:28.071
FAMILIES TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:29.306
AND GET TRIED TO FAMILIES AND

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.475
PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY SO I'M

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.243
TO UNDERSTAND BUSINESS BECAUSE

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.178
I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.680
THE BOTTOM LINE. IS ABOUT THE

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.048
PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.683
IMPACTED BY IT. AND I CAN TELL

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.785
YOU YOUR LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOUR

BUSINESSES THERE. I UNDERSTAND

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:57.501

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.504

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.849
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUSTAIN IT.

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:14.651
IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. WHEN

WORK THAT NONPROFIT. OUR

IT. GO AND COMING THROUGH THE

00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:07.070
ARCHIVES. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.839
ABOUT HAVING INFORMATION BUT

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:11.441

SHARE THEIR MATERIAL AND PUT

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.198
THEM IN OUR TAX AND MAKE THOSE

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.299
ARCHIVES AVAILABLE TO OUR

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.468
LIBRARIES. AROUND THE STATE SO

OUT WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ALL

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.440
ABOUT. BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:45.075
WILL HELP US TO GET BEYOND SOME

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.443
OF THE HATRED THAT WE FEEL.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.711
SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:50.847
WE FACE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:51.481
THE CHALLENGES WE WILL CONTINUE

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:52.616
TO FACE. IT IS INTERESTING AS I

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:53.784
LOOKED AT THE SECRETARY OF

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.585
STATE'S POSITION. AND TRY TO

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.421
COMPARE MYSELF TO AND FIGURE

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.022
OUT HOW TO WORK WITH OPINION. I

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:00.724
REALIZE IT IS MOST THINGS MOST

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:01.425
OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN IN

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.793
PREPARATION FOR TO BE SECRETARY

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.961
OF STATE. THAT THE THINGS I

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.797
HAVE DONE NOT ONLY IN MY JUST

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.698
GENERAL BELIEF ABOUT VOTING AND

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:10.567
THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN HERE.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:11.935
BUT MY EFFORTS TO WORK IN OUR

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.336
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:15.038
EVERY RESOURCE THAT WE HAD WAS

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:17.207
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THAT THE

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.108
INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.776
INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE ARE

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.745
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE TALK

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:22.412
ABOUT THE HATRED THAT'S IN THIS

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.714
COUNTRY. BUT MOST OF US LOOK AT

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.349
WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE WEEKS

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:26.983

SADNESS. TREMENDOUS SADNESS

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.554
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WERE MUCH

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.522
FURTHER ALONG THAN WE WERE. BUT

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:35.392
WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.026
ARE PROBABLY BETTER OFF THAN WE

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:37.994
WERE BEFORE. BUT THIS IS. WHAT

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.563

VIGILANT ABOUT THOSE THINGS

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.270
THAT ARE IMPORTANT. THAT WE

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.005
COULD NOT TURN OUR BACK ON.

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.207

OPPOSITION TO IT IN OTHER WORDS

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:41.443

TRAJECTORY OF YOUNG PEOPLE- I

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.488
WONDERED IF THERE MIGHT BE AN

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.423
OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY NOW AS-

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.258

CALIFORNIA TO. HAVE ANOTHER

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:28.029
LOOK AT THIS AS YOU KNOW. THE

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:28.663
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.632

THE REPUBLICAN. MINORITY

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.771
LEADER. ALSO SUPPORTING THIS

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:38.773
MEASURE I WONDER IF THE AS THE

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.075
CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICER FOR THE

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.510
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MIGHT

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.777
BE ABLE TO HELP TAKE A SECOND

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.213
LOOK AT. HOW WE CAN HELP EXPAND

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.148
VOTER RIGHTS ESPECIALLY FOR

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:50.218
YOUNG PEOPLE. I THINK WE ALWAYS

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:50.852
LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW I'M OPPOSED

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:51.720
TO IT. I HAVE VOTED AGAIN IT IN

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:55.023
THE PAST- AND OVERRIDE REASONS

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.491
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.193
I'M NOT THE RABBIT AGAINST IT

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.228
YOU KNOW AND- I HAVEN'T REALLY

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.264
SPOKEN ON THE FLOOR AGAINST IT-

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.231
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.399
VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AS TO

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.734
WHY PEOPLE THINK IT'S SEVENTEEN

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.335
VERSUS EIGHTEEN VERSUS SIXTEEN.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:08.470
WE'VE HEARD EVEN TALK ABOUT IS

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.138
BEING SIXTEEN AND SO THERE'S

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.339
CERTAIN PARTICULAR PARTICULAR

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.774
REASONS WHY I THINK EIGHTEEN IS

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.277
A BETTER AGE AND UP. THEN SINCE

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.178
SEVENTEEN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:17.913
HAVE CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT WE

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.381
LAID OUT A LOT EIGHTEEN YEAR

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.082
OLDS TO DO AND WE HAVE RAISES.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.185
THE UP THE AGE OF SMOKING I

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.553
THINK IT IS BECAUSE WE THINK

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:25.754
THEY'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.988
MAKE THAT DECISION YET THEY'RE

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.290
MATURE ENOUGH TO VOTE SO THAT

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.758
IT. SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:31.893
THAT WE HAVE TO HALF. OFF AND I

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.994
WAS PLEASED THAT THE PEOPLE OF

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:34.596
CALIFORNIA TO GO TO THE POLLS.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:35.764
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.199
DECISION THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:40.235
TO MAKE AND- AND I DIDN'T LOBBY

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.336
AGAINST IT BECAUSE I THINK

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.170
THERE'S ENOUGH THINGS THAT

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.538
CALIFORNIA THAT PEOPLE CAN TALK

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:45.707
ABOUT IT INTELLIGENTLY. AND

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:48.176
THEY VOTED AGAINST. US SO WE

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:49.244
CAN BEGIN THE CONVERSATION

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.346
AGAIN BUT UP BUT I THINK THAT

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.014
UP ONCE THEY VOTED AGAINST IT

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.950
IT'S LIKE WELL DO WE TAKE IT UP

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:55.850
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.686
KIND OF LIKE. WHAT WE GONNA DO

ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ARE WE

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.721
GOING TO CONTINUE TO BEAT THAT

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:00.855
HORSE TO DO WE LOOK FOR

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:01.590
SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:02.891
EVENTUALLY. HELP PEOPLE TO

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:05.794
UNDERSTAND IT- BUT- BUT IT IS

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.229
IT IS SOMETHING TO CALIFORNIA

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.296
VOTED AGAINST IN THE LAST

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.631
ELECTION. A WITH A LOT OF

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.498
PROGRESSIVE THINGS ON THE

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.067
AGENDA THEY VOTED AGAINST IT

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.369
AND SO- WE CAN LOOK AT IT AGAIN

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:15.437
YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:16.638
ALWAYS LEARNED IN MY LIFE IS

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:17.939
THAT IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED IS

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:19.708
THAT THERE'S ALWAYS CHANGE. IT

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.176
WAS ALWAYS CONVERSATION.

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.477
THERE'S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:23.778
AND- THAT'S PROBABLY MY

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.213
ACADEMIC BACKGROUND IT LOVES TO

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.715
HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER AND

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.150
OVER AND OVER AGAIN- BUT I'M

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.752
ALWAYS OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.754
IT'S THEIR- HAND UP AND WE CAN

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:34.456
SEE IF PEOPLE'S. MINDS HAVE

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:36.291
CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.626
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH VOTED

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.327
AGAINST. FORT IT DIDN'T MAKE

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.162
THE CHANGE. MAYBE IT'S TOO MANY

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.097
THINGS ON THE BALLOT I DON'T

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.232
KNOW. YOU KNOW. THAT ALWAYS

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:45.267
HAPPENS OF PEOPLE JUST GET

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.102
TIRED. AND DECIDED TO WANT EVEN

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:53.408
MORE CHANGE AND THAT'S IT. SO-

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.009
I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:54.542
SO SEVENTEEN A THOSE WERE

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:55.377
ADVOCATES. WHICH FACE.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:56.244
APPROACHABLE DIFFERENTLY. AND

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:56.878
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PER.

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.146
WILLING TO LISTEN. AND A

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.247
CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:00.582
HAD SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:01.850
AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN. IN THE

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:02.917
MIDST OF THE NOISE OF THE

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:03.952
ELECTION PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:06.321
UNDERSTAND IT. SO WE HAVE

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.756
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT YES

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:08.690
SHOULD WE LEAVE THOSE

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:09.824
CONVERSATIONS PROBABLY SO TO

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.760
SEE PEOPLE INTERESTED. AND I'D

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:12.594
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.095
THOSE WHO HAVE IT AS A- AS A

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.630
MAJOR AGENDA. ITEM TO BEGIN TO

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.699
TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW. AND I

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:18.466
THINK COMMUNITIES A VERY

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:19.701
DIFFERENT ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.802
DISCOVERED WITH MY COLLEAGUES

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.170
IN SAN DIEGO'S DEPENDING ON

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:24.005
WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU LIVE IN.

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:24.873
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.641
THINK ABOUT VOTING. YOU KNOW IN

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.276
THE SAME IN THE SAME AREA WHERE

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.344
I HAVE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.212
WERE MORE. EMANCIPATED BECAUSE

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:32.947
OF ITS LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES MAYBE

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:33.748
THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T SPEAK

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.917
ENGLISH OR WHATEVER MAY BE- TWO

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.319
ACTIVE THEY WERE VERY IN FAVOR

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.987
OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.922
VOTING. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.324
WHERE THERE WAS AND- THERE WERE

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.792
TWO PARENTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:44.426
AND ALL THESE. THINGS THEY WERE

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:46.361
VERY OPPOSED TO IT. SO WE HAD

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.529
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT WE HAD

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:49.531
BOTH OF THEM. BASICALLY OPPOSED

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:50.598
TO ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:51.766
CONVERSATION SO I THINK THERE'S

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.967
A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:55.103
HAD. BUT IT'S NOT ALL ONE ONE

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.571
DIRECTION AS WE SOMETIMES THINK

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.506
IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW.

01:22:58.573 --> 01:22:59.374
WHAT THAT THE I THINK THAT'S

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.709
AGAIN AND CORN AND SPINACH

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:04.846
ESPECIALLY. A SPIRIT OF

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.514
FRANCHISING IT. THESE IN. ARE

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.248
EIGHTEEN. BY THE- ELECTION BUT

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.817
BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.485
CONTINUALLY MOVES. ARE

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:11.953
PRIMARIES FROM JUNE TO MARCH.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.288
YOU HAVE A SEGMENT OF THE

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.289
POPULATION. ESPECIALLY YOUNG

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.558
PEOPLE. AND WHAT HOW WHAT A

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:18.226
BETTER WAY TO HELP INSPIRE AND

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:19.961
SEEING ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.229
INSPIRE THEM TO BE THE NEXT

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:22.330
FREELY WEAPONS OF THE WORLD IN

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.298
WHICH WE GO ON HIGH SCHOOL

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.100
CAMPUSES. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.535
TRULY. HAVE A SENSE OF VOTING.

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:28.903
INSPIRED THAT SENSE AND SO AT

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.839
LEAST THE OPEN CONVERSATION. AS

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.273
WE EVOLVE AND THINK ABOUT THEN

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.875
THE ROLE. AS THE CHIEF

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:34.843
ELECTIONS OFFICER FOR THE

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.277
ENTIRE STATE. NOT JUST ONE

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.712
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATRE. OF

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:38.880
COURSE KEEPING OPEN MINDED

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.315
THAT. AND IT WAS VERY MUCH

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.683
APPRECIATED. AND IT'S AND I

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:42.951
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.552
ALLEGE THE SECTOR STATE DOES

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.820
GOING TO BEGIN THE IRVINE. AND

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.856
BRIDGES TO YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY-

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:49.357
AND WE DID A LOT OF THOSE THAT

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:50.625
THEY DID A LOT THIS PAST YEAR

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:51.526
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE READY

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:52.594
FOR. WHEN THAT WHENEVER THE

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.462
TIME WAS TO COME TO VOTE- AND

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.331
SO- WE- THERE'S A ROBUST HIGH

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.166
SCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT GOES INTO

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.134
REGISTERED YOUNG PEOPLE TO

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.969
VOTE. AND I KNOW THERE'S ALSO A

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:02.570
PROGRAM THAT HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.805
WHO WORK AT THE POLLS. SHOULD

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:05.106
BASICALLY BEGIN TO WORK THE

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.875
POST TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT. AT

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:09.511
THE CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY IS SO-

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.445
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:15.316
YES. HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:16.618
THANK YOU CHAIR LOW. ANY OTHER.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.220
OR COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.222
I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION DR

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.625
WEBER. THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.026
CHOICE ACT WAS ENACTED DURING

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.694
YOUR TIME AS CHAIR OF THE

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:27.162
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:28.997
REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE FIFTEEN

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:29.998
COUNTIES MAKING UP MORE THAN

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:31.933
HALF OF THE STATE'S VOTERS USED

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.635
THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT TO

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:34.536
CONDUCT ELECTIONS IN TWENTY

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:37.071
TWENTY. DO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:38.339
EXPANDTHE USE OF THE VOTERS

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:40.608
FOR A SECOND CALIFORNIA- IF SO

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.143
SHOULD THE STATE MANDATE THAT

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.144
ALL COUNTIES CONDUCT ELECTIONS

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.947
USING THEM ALL- AND IF YOU DO

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.248
NOT SUPPORT MANDATING COUNTIES

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.550
USE THAT MODEL HOW MIGHT WE

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.418
ENCOURAGE MORE COUNTIES. TO DO

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:52.787
SO VOLUNTARILY WELL I THINK YOU

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.789
KNOW THAT TOO ISN'T AN ISSUE

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:55.557
FOR THE LEGISLATURE IF THEY

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:56.891
WANT TO ACTUALLY MANDATE THOUGH

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.060
THEM TO USE IT WE PASSED IT- WE

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.895
PASS IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.330
THAT PEOPLE COULD OPT IN AND

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.132
OPT OUT OKAY- I THINK WE

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:05.266
DEMONSTRATED IN THIS LAST

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.167
ELECTION THAT IT IS A GOOD

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.269
CHOICE. AND IT'S AND PROVIDING

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.271
MULTIPLE CHOICES FOR VOTING IT

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.640
IS GREAT- THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:14.075
MANDATE IT AND I WOULD I WOULD

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.710
PROBABLY BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:18.446
THEM DOING THAT- AND BECAUSE I

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.048
THINK IT DOES BEGIN TO ADDRESS

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:23.184
THE ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY AND

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.452
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.687
CHANCE TO VOTE IN THOSE KIND OF

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:26.821
THINGS I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:27.922
ANY OPPOSITION TO IT AT THIS

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.224
POINT. THE ONLY OPPOSITION

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.992
HERBAL SOMEWHAT FOLKS WANTED A

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.594
FIVE SHORTER TIME FRAME THREE

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.362
DAYS VERSUS TWO WEEKS IN TERMS

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.363
OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GO TO

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.165
THE POLLS AT NIGHT AND I MIGHT

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.600
MY RECOMMENDATION WAS LET'S

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.435
LET'S BASICALLY MAKE IT SO THAT

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:41.936
THERE'S A MINIMUM OF THREE DAYS

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.071
WHICH MEANS THE LOSS AND IT'S

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.706
COULD HAVE A WEEK AND A HALF.

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.040
YOU KNOW SMALLER COUNTIES CAN

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.575
HAVE THREE FOUR DAYS BECAUSE

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:48.743
THAT'S WHAT SHOWS UP TO GIVE

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.078
THEM THE FLEXIBILITY BUT I

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.479
THINK WE LEARNED A LOT IN THIS

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:52.847
LAST ELECTION THAT IT THAT IT

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.816
IS NOT THAT IT IS REALLY OF THE

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:55.617
THINGS WE PUT IN PLACE OF

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:56.985
REALLY GOOD THINGS. THAT IT

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.219
REALLY OPENS UP PEOPLE'S

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.921
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AND THEN WE

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.656
HAVE SOMETIMES GOTTEN PAST THE

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:04.492
FEAR OF- VOTING BY MAIL.

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:07.195
BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER- WORKING

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:08.730
A CAMPAIGN BACK IN THE EIGHTIES

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.698
I THINK IT WAS AND IT WAS LIKE

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:12.467
HILL GETTING PEOPLE IN AFRICAN

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.968
AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO VOTE BY

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:15.603
MAIL. AND I UNDERSTOOD THEIR

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.038
FEARS THEIR FEARS WHERE THEY

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:21.276
HAD. BEEN FOR THE SOUTH THE NEW

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:21.843
PEOPLE WOULDN'T TAKE THEY'RE

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:22.977
BACK. YEARS WOULD BE MY THOUGHT

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:24.112
AWAY. THEY WANT TO PERSONALLY

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.113
PUT IT IN THE- BOX. THIS TIME I

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.948
THINK PEOPLE LAW. AND BECAUSE

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:27.949
OF THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.817
WERE DONE IN THE VOTING CENTERS

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:30.885
AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS IN

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.220
THE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THERE

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:33.955
AND- ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.189
PEOPLE BECAME MUCH MORE

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.124
AGREEABLE TO IT WILL

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.992
COMFORTABLE AND PLUS BEING IN A

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.627
PANDEMIC IT FELT IT WAS SAFER.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.995
AND THEN THE RESULTS THAT CAME

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.063
OUT THAT SHOWED THE LARGE

DISINFORMATION WARS THAT ARE

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:20.835

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:21.836
THINGS THAT HAPPENED THIS LAST

THAT DOES OUTREACH. AND IN MY

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.178
CONVERSATION WAS WITH WITH MANY

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.512
OF THEM TO SAID WE NEED TO.

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.947

BUT WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.688
THAT INFORMATION THAT COMES

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:43.124
OUT. IS COUNTERED. COUNTED BY

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.192

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:45.927
MESSENGERS. SO THAT PEOPLE IN

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:47.128
COMMUNITY SAID THAT YOU CAN

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.563
REACH OUT TO NON BUSINESSES AND

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.964

CORRECT INFORMATION IS ABOUT

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.304
AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY BE

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.306
VERY ENGAGING VERY INVOLVED. IN

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.273

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:02.510
IF THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND

WE ARE RESPONDING TO IT. THAT

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.680
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AND

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.015
COMMUNITIES WHETHER THE LECTIN

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.319
TRUSTED MESSENGER THAT CAN

CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT.

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:18.126
THE MISINFORMATION IS THERE. SO

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:19.594
THAT WILL ALWAYS BE AN ONGOING

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:22.263
CHALLENGE. BECAUSE AS WE MADE-

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.098
THE ABILITY TO SPREAD MESSAGES

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.700
EASIER. FROM THE GENERAL

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.201

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.436
KIND OF THOSE MESSAGES WHEN

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:29.704
THEY COME UP AND THAT AND SO

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:31.339
THERE IS A SECTION. IN THE

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.273
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.275
THAT HAS TO BE INCREASED TO

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:35.276
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS ON

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:37.045

WHAT THE INFORMATION IS ABOUT.

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:47.355
AND BEING ON TOP OF IT SO THAT

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.724
WE CAN- FIRST HOPEFULLY SQUASH

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.292
THE INFORMATION AS IT COMES OUT

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.460

WITHOUT. IF YOU DON'T RESPOND

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.069

LET ME JUST SAY THAT- MORE

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:46.667
PROBABLY ONE OF. A REGRET THAT

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:48.903
I HAVE- WHEN I WAS AT SAN DIEGO

HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BASICALLY

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:37.318
DECIDE OF BECAUSE YOU WRITE THE

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.085
LEGISLATION AS TO WHETHER THAT

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:42.356
IT'S A MANDTE VERSUS EIGHTY- A

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:43.757
SUGGESTION. THAT THERE- I WOULD

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.226
HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.694
MAKE IT SO ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.261
THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO DO

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:48.829
IT. NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:52.733
HEARD FROM- ONE OF THE NEWS.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.034
PER PERSON WAS INTERVIEWING ME

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.636
BASICALLY SAY THAT. MANY OF THE

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:56.770
REGISTRARS OF VOTERS THIS TIME

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.772
REALLY LIKE WHAT TOOK PLACE

01:37:58.839 --> 01:37:59.373
BECAUSE WE GAVE THE MONEY TO

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.208
GET IT DONE. YOU KNOW WE

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.476
PROVIDED THEM WITH THE STAFF

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:03.711
THAT WAS ESSENTIAL TO DEAL WITH

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:05.446
THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND MAIL

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:06.780
IN BALLOTS AND ALL THOSE KINDS

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:07.448
OF THINGS. WHAT WE DIDN'T

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:09.817
BEFORE. I THINK IT'S AS MUCH AS

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:11.685
WE CAN GET OUR PUBLIC OR

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.087
COUNTIES AND OTHERS TO BE

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:13.921
COOPERATIVE AND TO BE

01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:15.222
SUPPORTIVE. YOU KNOW IT'S

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:16.423
ALWAYS BETTER IT'S ALWAYS

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.058
BETTER THAN A MANDATE IT REALLY

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:18.959
IS IF YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:20.661
WORK WITH YOU. CAN THEY I'M NOT

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.662
SURE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SOME

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:22.997
THINGS THIS IS SOME WILL AND

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:25.132
SOME WON'T- BUT THE MAIN THING

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:26.100
IS THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:28.135
EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO

01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:29.970
A BALLOT. AND ACCESS TO THE

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:31.372
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AND THAT'S

01:38:31.438 --> 01:38:32.406
THEN THAT'S WHAT'S THE MOST

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.340
CRITICAL THING WHETHER IT'S

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:35.042
MILLION OR NOT- MILLION MAKES

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:36.510
IT CONVENIENT FOR A LOT OF

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.311
PEOPLE TO GET A MAIL IN BALLOT

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:38.612
BUT THEN THEY SHOULD. IF THEY

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:39.913
GET A MAIL BALLOT THEY SHE'LL

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.482
SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:43.217
TURN IT IN. AND THAT'S WHY I

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:44.585
FIRMLY BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.120
ARE SOME FOLKS WHO DO NOT WANT

01:38:46.186 --> 01:38:47.788
TO PUT THE STUFF IN THE MAIL.

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.690
AND WHO FEEL THE MAIL SLOW. I

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:50.891

PRIMARY AS A RESULT OF KOPET

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:55.209
BEFORE THAT THE GENERAL

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:57.344
ELECTION AND THE NOTICE WAS

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.979
RECEIVED THAT HIS NAME HAD BEEN

LEAST SAMBAR TO DINO COUNTY WAS

DOING IT RIGHT. MY QUESTION IS

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.288
CLEARLY WE HAD AN AMAZING

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:11.091
TURNOUT THIS LAST ELECTION I

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:13.360
WITH A RECORD HIGH OF 80% JUST

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:14.795
AS YOU'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER AND

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.497
MY QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOUR

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:20.200
PLANS TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS.

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:21.735
WELL I THINK PART OF IT AS A

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.604
STATE IS THAT IT ONE OF THE

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.172
THINGS YOU LEARN IS THAT THERE

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:28.475
ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE VOTE. OF

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:32.746
FOUR AND THAT'S IMPORTANT- BUT

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:33.347
HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T VOTE AT

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:34.414
ALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:36.183
COMMUNITIES DON'T SEE THE FLIP

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.318
SIDE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.186
LACK OF RESOURCES THAT COME

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.621
INTO A COMMUNITY WHEN YOU DON'T

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:41.855
BOOK. OF THE LACK OF

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:43.824
REPRESENTATION THAT HAPPENS IN

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:44.858
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T VOTE.

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:46.159
AND SO WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:48.128
EDUCATE THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:49.029
THE COIN IS NOT ONLY WHY YOU

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:50.364
VOCAL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.665
DON'T. AND THAT BECOMES

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.800
IMPORTANT WE DO THAT THAT'S

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:54.368
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.069
LIKE CIVIC EDUCATION OUTREACH

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.638
EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING OUT TO

01:42:57.704 --> 01:42:58.672
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. MAKING

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.807
SURE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE MORE

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:01.708
THAN JUST A SUGGESTION FOR

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.577
YOUNG FIRMANDO COMING UP ROLE

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.445
BUT TO REGISTER TO VOTE.

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:06.647
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:07.748
GIVING A LITTLE. AND A HOST OF

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:09.316
THINGS WE COULD REGISTER AT THE

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:10.651
SAME TIME TO VOTE. I'M MAKING

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:11.485
SURE THEY GET THE CORRECT

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:13.153
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR THEIR

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.489
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT. THAT

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:16.657
WILL INCREASE HOPEFULLY THE

01:43:16.723 --> 01:43:18.225
NUMBER PERSON TO ON THE PHONE

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.459
THE FOOTBALL OF ROLES TO VOTE.

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:21.461
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:23.430
THE KIND OF- OUTREACH AND

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:24.798
PUBLICITY THAT'S ALWAYS CENTRAL

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:27.167

MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.205
IT'S TIME TO VOTE THEN AND IF

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:33.407
IT AND EMPHASIZING A VERY

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:34.675
POSITIVE WAY TO THINGS THAT ARE

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:37.611
GOING ON. LOADING IT. THE ABOUT

MEANT SOMETHING. AND WE NEED TO
