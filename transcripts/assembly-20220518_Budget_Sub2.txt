HEARING THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET. SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE AND TODAY IS THE MAY REVISE HEARING. GOING OVER THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE BUDGET PROPOSALS. DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT- DAYS INFORMATIONAL ONLY- WE WON'T BE HAVE VOTING ANY ITEMS TODAY- WE'LL HAVE PUBLIC COME AT THE END OF COURSE A SO HERE WE ARE IN- IN YEAR TWO A REALLY YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE SAID IT ONCE IN A GENERATION BUDGET AND I GUESS THIS IS PART TWO OF THAT- THAT- HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW REMARKABLE. WHERE WE'D BEEN A LAST TEN YEARS AS FAR AS PER PUPIL FUNDING ESSENTIALLY- DOUBLING IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS- LAST DECADE OR SO- SO BIG PICTURE SO WE CERTAINLY- OUR AGREEMENT THE SAME- REVENUE NUMBERS FOR PROPAGANDHI EIGHT GROWTH- I THINK WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WE HAVE IS A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE IS IN. ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO GET TO IN A BIT HE IS- WE'D LIKE TO SEE- MORE MONEY GOING ON GOING TO THE BASE AND- YOU KNOW WE WENT AWAY FROM THIS. CATEGORICAL BASED PROGRAM A DECADE AGO TO THIS EQUITY BASED FUNDING FORMULA FOR A REASON AND WITH THESE ONE TIME MONIES I THINK WE SEE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH. AS FAR AS THESE ONE TIME CATEGORICAL AS THEY SOUND GOOD. BUT WE WE'RE SEEING DISTRICTS AREN'T ABLE AREN'T ALWAYS ABLE TO SPEND THE MONEY BECAUSE THERE ONE TIME AND THEIR PEOPLE JEVON. IDEAS AND SO- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO ADDRESS ADDRESS AND HAVING MORE. ONGOING MONEY TO THE BASE- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR- PRIORITIES- OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. BE MINDFUL AND DEAL WITH- THIS PANDEMIC AT COVIDIEN YOU KNOW TOO MANY KIDS. ARE FACING- LEARNING LOSS AND- AND KIND OF GET BACK IN THE SWING OF THINGS AS FAR AS RECOVERY- AND THE LAST THING THAT I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON. IS THIS WHOLE ISSUE WITH SCHOOLS HAVING. DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE VERSES- ENROLLMENTS. AND I'LL JUST SAY IT STRAIGHT UP I THINK THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GETTING SUPER DISTRACTED. YOU'RE FOCUSING ON A FEW COINS ON THE GROUND AND NOT LOOKING IN FRONT OF YOU ON THE POLLS. WHERE THERE IS HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS PLASTERED ACROSS YOUR FACE. BECAUSE WHAT THIS MEANS IN SIMPLE ENGLISH HIS WE HAVE FEWER KIDS. GOING TO SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT WE'RE GETTING MORE MONEY TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HAS A JOB WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU MORE MONEY FOR DOING LESS WORK SO GRANTED WE HAVE TO RECONCILE THAT WITH THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BASE BUT THE MONEY'S NOT GOING ELSEWHERE IT'S NOT GOING TO. CORRECTIONS BUDGET IS NOT GOING TO THE RESERVE IS GOING 240% TO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SO LET'S NOT GET. SIDETRACKED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE NATIONAL TREND WITH THE- DECLINING ENROLLMENT WITH- DEMOGRAPHICS AND SO FORTH- WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE REALLY. MINDFUL ABOUT AS- CHILD CARE AND EARLY EDUCATION- WE KNOW THAT LAST YEAR WE SET ASIDE A PROGRAMMING TO TAP THE FIRST TIME. A UNIVERSAL EARLY AT THREE FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS VIET TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE KNOW THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS CHILD CARE. WHICH WE WHICH WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS STILL UNDER FUNDED AS FAR AS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE WE GET REAL AND FINISH THE JOB AS FAR AS RATE- REIMBURSEMENTS FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- SO WITH THAT- WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO GO OVER THERE PROP NINETY EIGHT. PROPOSALS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE ABOUT THAT- BUDGET LETTERS AS WELL AND THEN WE'LL GET TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ENGAGEMENT AND THEN FINALLY PUBLIC COMMENTS. BEFORE WE GO MISTER O'DONNELL OPENING REMARKS YES I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO HEAR PRESENTATIONS TODAY- WERE AN INTERESTING MOMENT. BUT I KEEP HEARING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MORE MONEY MORE MONEY YES MORE MONEY BUT I WAS ALSO WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT COSTS ARE HIGHER. AND SO IT'S AN HISTORIC NUMBERS WAS INFLATION TO STORE RIGHT NOW TO. WE DON'T CELEBRATE AFTER THAT IS A FACT SO I CAN HERE'S MY LITTLE CHARTS SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN MY CHARTER. THIS IS THE- TO THE O. S. C. P. I RECALL IN MY OFFICE THIS IS THE O'DONNELL SCHOOL COST PRICE INDEX AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE WHAT YOU'LL SEE- IS. CPI CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IN MARCH WAS EIGHT POINT 5% OSCARS IN PERSIAN MIX THOSE GET ABOUT TWO POINT THREE FIVE PERCENT. THEY'RE DIFFERENT RATE INCREASES FOR EACH. SYSTEM STORAGE CENTERS BUT TWO POINT THREE FIVE FOR THAT AND THEN YOU IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER SCHOOL OTHER COST PRESSURES RETURNING UNIQUE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WERE ABOUT FOUR POINT 15% THAT WOULD DIFFER ACROSS THE STATE OF COURSE THAT NUMBER AND THAT COULD BE A VARIETY OF THINGS- COULD BE DECLINING ENROLLMENT COULD BE TRYING TO HIRE PEOPLE TO GET IN THE DOOR- THE NEED TO INCREASE- YOUR WAGES. THIS ESPECIALLY IN THE CLASS RIGHT SIDE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET CLASSIFIED FOLKS IN THE DOOR RIGHT NOW BUT THE SAME TIME TEACHERS TO EITHER LOCAL. ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT HUMAN RESOURCE TO SHARE WITH ME THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER CAREER SHE SAW PEOPLE JUST LEAVING TAT. THE PROFESSION COMPLETELY. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR THE YEAR THAT THEY GONNA KEEP YOU THERE FOR THE YEAR BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE. THEY'LL THEY CAN SEIZE YOUR CREDENTIALING GO AFTER YOUR TEACHING CREDENTIAL A DISTRICT CAN. THAT THAT'S REALLY THE HOOK TO KEEP YOU THERE FOR THE FOR THE YEAR. BUT WHAT THIS SUPERINTENDENT ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT SHARING WITH ME WAS THAT FOLKS WERE STILL LEADING THEIR SINGLE NEVER USE MY CREDENTIALS AND I'M I'M LEAVING I. CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE SO- WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR- SO THERE'S COST PRESSURES THERE SOARED ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT. WHEN YOU TAKE THE CPI ETCETERA CPI- PENSION OBLIGATION AND THEN OTHER COST PRESSURES ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT. ABOUT 15% ON THIS CHART AND YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR DID JUST WHAT LAST WEEK IT'S ABOUT 10% AND I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR DOING THAT. SO NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO CONVERSATIONS WHERE I WANNA PUSH THAT BASE ALLOCATION UP. HEY I'M AIMING 415% PLUS. BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS NEEDED AND WE. CAN DO IT THE MONEY IS THERE. OUR I APPRECIATE WERE THE GOVERNOR. UNDER AND AS AS BEEN MANY. AND OTHER FOR. I AM A BIT CONCERNED THAT WE SEEM TO BE SENDING SOME OF THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL DAY- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S COMPLETELY LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE QUITE FRANKLY- GIVEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN THE MANDATE. AS TO HOW WE SPEND THIS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS. BUT AGAIN WHAT A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT AND I APPRECIATE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY- INTERVENE IN RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED. TO BUMP UP THAT BASE YES WE NEED TO DO THAT. WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT SCHOOL FACILITIES. SCHOOL FACILITIES ACTUALLY IMPACT. THE COST OF HOUSING. IN SOME AREAS CROSSES OUR STATE BECAUSE OF THERE IS NO MORE. MONEY IN THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM TO KEEP IT SIMPLE THERE'S NO MORE MONEY THERE. THAT RUNS OUT. WHAT HAPPENS IS LEVEL THREE FROM LEVEL FIVE THREE. A DEVELOPER FEES KICK IN. THAT MEANS OF A DEVELOPER BUILDS A NEW HOUSE IN A HOUSING PROJECT THEY'RE NOT TO FIND A SCHOOL. ON TOP OF THAT THAT MEANS THE PURCHASER. OF THAT NEW HOME. IS GOING TO PAY FOR THAT NEW SCHOOLS WELL WE'VE HAD A PARTNERSHIP FOR YEARS- WHEN THERE'S MONEY IT WORKS WELL. AS A PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP- TO BUILD SCHOOLS- AND- MODERNIZATION TO MODERNIZE SCHOOLS- SO AGAIN I HOPE THAT WE HAVE- INCLUDE OUR CONVERSATION THE NEED. TO INCREASE THE MONEY FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES IN THAT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AND AGAIN I KNOW ALL AGREE HERE THAT THE SMARTEST THING WE CAN DO WHETHER MONEY IS TO. PAY A LONG TERM DEBT. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHERS OTHER IDEAS TO THE WILL BUT WE TALK ABOUT AS A LEGISLATURE. BUT VERY SIMPLY THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE I STAND INCREASING THAT PACE. A SUPPORTING SCHOOL FACILITIES I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS. TODAY MISTER CHAIR. OKAY YOU ANY OTHER HOPING COMMENTS BEFORE WE START. I SEEING NINE LET'S BRING UP. LET'S BRING UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND R. ELIA- TO GO OVER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MAY REVISE OVERVIEW. HE'S BEEN. HI WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED HI- HELLO CHAIR NUMBERS I'M I'M AND SAYING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL BE PRESENTING YOU WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THEIR PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS WELL AS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE MAYOR VISION YOU BRING TO MAKE LITTLE CLOSER. IS THIS BETTER WAY BETTER THANK YOU. YEAH THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT NINETEEN POINT SIX BILLION ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE THREE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. COMPARED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THIRTY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT. GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH AND GENERAL FUND REVENUES. ALL BUDGET YEARS REMAIN AND A TEST ONE WHICH MEANS THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY 38% OF THE REVENUE CHANGES IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS AND THE BUDGET WINDOW. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS RE BENCH TO REFLECT THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. NUMBER ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT POLICY ADJUSTMENTS AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OF THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN IS ON GOING AND SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION IS FOR ONE TIME EXPENDITURES. AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OR ADA IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE ABOUT 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. EIGHTY EIGHT CALCULATIONS INCLUDE UPDATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MILLION ROLLING T. K. STUDENTS AS WELL AS FEWER STUDENTS ABSENCES. EXPECTED TUDOREL COVERED NINETEEN. IN REGARD TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTED THAT A TOTAL OF NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN PAYMENTS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT WOULD BE NEEDED BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO. TWENTY THREE. ADJUSTMENTS IN CAPITAL GAINS REVENUES AT THE CURRENT MAYOR EFFICIENT HAVE REVISED THESE REQUIRED PAYMENTS DOWN FROM THAT NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION NOT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO A CURRENT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION. ON NOW MOVE ON TO LCF. OKAY ACTUALLY THE ON THE GO NEXT CAN. HI SURE I CAN COUPON WITH THE LEAD GENERALIST OFFICE THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE INCREASE IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AT THE NINETEEN POINT SIX BILLION OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD IS REALLY A BIG STORY BUT IT'S NOT A VERY COMPLICATED ONE- COMPARED WITH JANUARY REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE UP ABOUT FIFTY SIX BILLION OVER THAT PERIOD SO THE INCREASE IN THE GUARANTEE IS A- JUST UNDER 40% OF THAT AMOUNT- WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S GENERAL FUND ESTIMATES. REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE THEY'RE FAIRLY CLOSE TO- THE ESTIMATES THAT WERE FINALIZING. A SMALL PORTION OF THAT INCREASE IS OFFSET BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S. PROPERTY TAX REVENUE- THIS BROUGHT DOWN THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- COMPARED TO JANUARY. AND WE THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE LOW ON THAT ONE- WE THINK PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS LIKELY TO COME IN. I CLOSER TO JANUARY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT HAPPENS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE I WOULD INCREASE ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS- THAT'S KIND OF OUR I TAKE ON THE GUARANTEE ITSELF- I CAN TURN THINGS MAYBE BACK TO MICHAEL TO GET FINANCE IF THEY WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING FROM. THE BIG TICKET SPENDING ITEMS. SURE. NINETY OKAY- INSING DEPART OF FINANCE- ALL OF ALSO NOW- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AT MAYOR VISION THE LCF DECREASED BY ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO BUDGET OCT ARE COMPARED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT WHICH POINT WE HAD PROJECTED AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROJECTED A DIETA KLEIN OF ABOUT SIX POINT 56% WE ALSO PROVIDE A TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY ONGOING INCREASE TO THE BASE L. C. WHICH COVER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF RISING PENSION OBLIGATIONS INCREASE COSTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. AND OTHER LOCAL BUDGET CONCERNS. THIS INCREASE WILL FLOW THROUGH THE LCF FORMULA AND WILL INCREASE NOT ONLY THE BASE GRANT BUT THE CORRESPONDING SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS AS WELL. LANGUAGE FOR THIS ONGOING ADJUSTMENT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FORTHCOMING ARE AN- IN REGARD TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROTECTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE DECLINING INTRO ENROLLMENT PROTECTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH REFLECTS A REVISION OF THE THREE YEAR DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROTECTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY MODIFYING THE COMPUTATION. OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THREE YEAR AVERAGE. THIS PROTECTION IS PROVIDED FOR DISTRICTS AS AN ONGOING ADJUSTMENT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS WE PROVIDE A ONE TIME DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROTECTION FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR FOR CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ONLY. IN THE AMOUNT OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WE PROVIDE AN ONGOING BASE INCREASE TO THEIR L. C. F. AS WELL. THIS WILL BE IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS REGARDING LCF OFF. THANK YOU. HELLO AND IF I CAN I'LL JUST DIED FINISH UP REPRESENTATION HERE I THINK THE TIMING OF FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE BIG STRUCTURE OF THIS PACKAGE IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE BILLION AND TOTAL PROPOSALS INCLUDING SEVENTEEN BILLION THAT'S NEW IN IN MAY AND- AND THEY WERE AT AND ON TOP OF MONEY THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- JUST IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE THE BIGGEST ONE TIME ALLOCATION IS EIGHT BILLION FOR THE DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT I'LL THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. A LITTLE BIT LATER- FOR THE ON GOING ON MEDICATIONS- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA RECEIVES MOST OF THE ON GOING INCREASE- THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED ASPECT OF THIS PACKAGE JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE A COUPLE DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES BUT I THINK THE WAY TO STAY ORIENTED IS TO FOCUS ON THE TOP LINE NUMBER IS ALSO UNDER THE MAY REVISION AT THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR L. C. F. F. WOULD INCREASE ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION- FROM THE AMOUNT PROVIDED THIS YEAR GOING INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THAT'S A INCREASE OF AROUND TWO POINT NINE BILLION OVER JANUARY AND THAT'S THE RESULT OF THOSE- FOR ADJUSTMENTS YOU HEARD LOWER BASELINE ATTENDANCE A NEW PROPOSAL TO OFFSET THAT DECLINE INCREASING THE STATUTORY COLA FROM FIVE POINT 33% TO SIX POINT AUGMENTATION ON TOP OF THAT WHICH IS ABOUT THREE POINT 2% SO PUTTING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER THE OVERALL INCREASE THE POLICY A TEFT NEARLY 11% FROM THIS YEAR. THE COMING YEAR- THE MAYOR OF ASIAN ALSO CAN. AN AUGMENTATION FOR THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION- SO IN ADDITION TO THE COLA THERE IS AN INCREASE TO THE OPERATIONS GRANT. THAT WOULD AFFECT DIFFERENT COUNTIES DIFFERENTLY BUT WE THINK IT WOULD. ROUGHLY AVERAGE A 15% INCREASE IN THEIR LCF FUNDING. SOME COUNTIES RECEIVE THOSE INCREASES EVEN THOUGH THEIR FUNDING IS ALREADY ABOVE THE LCF TARGETS. I JUST TURNING TO SOME OF OUR COMMENTS- SO THIS AS THE CHAIRMAN CHEN IS THE LARGEST PROPOSITION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT KICKOFF PACKAGE SINCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- SIGNIFICANT NEW AUGMENTATIONS- BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME FEATURES THAT WOULD HELP. US BUILD THE STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCY AT LEAST WITHIN THE K. TWELVE BUDGET. AND WE THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT GIVEN SOME OF THE ECONOMIC WARNING SIGNS ARE THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT FROM A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES YESTERDAY- SO THE BUDGET. ALLOCATES NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF BILLION IN ONGOING K. CALL FUNDS TO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY SPECIAL ABOUT. THAT NUMBER YOU COULD GO HIGHER A LITTLE HIGHER A LITTLE BIT LOWER. BUT HAVING A QUESTION LIKE THAT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN A LOT MORE EASILY- THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SERVE ALSO GOES TO NINE POINT FIVE BILLION NEARLY 9% OF THE GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THAT'S NOT HUGE IN THAT CONTEXT BUT IT'S A VERY HELPFUL STARTING POINT FOR MANAGING POTENTIAL VOLATILITY NEXT YEAR IN THE YEARS TO COME. ON THE LCF WE THINK THE AUGMENTATIONS PROPOSED GENERALLY ARE REASONABLE. I PROVIDING INCREASE BEYOND THE STATUTORY COLO WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS TO SUSTAIN PROGRAM EXPANSIONS. IN THE FACE OF SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES THAT ON. THE CHAIR AND SOMETHING UMBRELLA O'DONNELL MENTIONED AT THE AT THE OPENING- WE ALSO THINK THAT THE PROPOSED ATTENDANCE- PROVISIONS ARE REASONABLE. BECAUSE THEY WOULD MITIGATE THE TEMPORARY DROP IN ATTENDANCE THAT DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING NOW WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A LINK BETWEEN THE FUNDING AND STUDENTS OVER THE LONG TERM. THAT WE DO HAVE SOME NOTABLE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION FOR COUNTY OFFICES- THE MAY REVISION WOULD INCREASE FUNDING AT A MUCH FASTER PACE THAN FOR DISTRICTS. WE DON'T SEE A COMPELLING RATIONALE FOR THAT AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WOULD MAGNIFY SOME OF THE HISTORICAL FUNDING INEQUITIES THE STATUS TRIED TO. EVEN OUT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THAT PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD PROVIDE AN INCREASE THAT'S MORE IN LINE. WITH WHAT'S PROPOSED FOR DISTRICTS- ON THE DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROPOSAL- WE THINK THAT'S AN IDEA THAT HAS SOME MERIT- COULD HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADDRESS THEIR HIGHEST ONE TIME PRIORITIES- PERHAPS COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS. ARE BEING PROPOSED- DEPENDING ON YOUR PRIORITIES YOU COULD THINK ABOUT PERHAPS TAILORING THE INTENT LANGUAGE- PERHAPS ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT BASED ON YOUR OVERALL K. TWELVE PRIORITIES. YOU CAN EVEN ADJUST THAT PAYMENTSCHEDULE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'D LIKE THAT TO COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS. YOU COULD CONSIDER DISPERSING THAT- ON THE SAME SCHEDULE- AS THOSE ITEMS- THERE ARE A FEW SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WE HAVE CONCERNS- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT SPECIFICALLY. ON SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION FOR THE TEACHER TRAINING IN THE ARTS MUSIC SET ASIDE. WITHIN THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM I THINK SOME OF THOSE MIGHT BE PREMATURE GIVEN SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY. BEEN PROPOSED IN JANUARY OR PROVIDED IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS- ONE OF THE LAST COMMENTS IS THAT WE'D SUGGEST YOU GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO POTENTIALLY PROVIDING. A LITTLE BIT MORE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR FACILITIES- THE STATE RIGHT NOW HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY ON A ONE TIME BASIS. AND USING THOSE FUNDS FOR FACILITIES COULD PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT COULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS. WE THINK YOU'VE GOT A FEW PROMISING OPTIONS- POTENTIALLY HELPING DISTRICTS OBTAIN FACILITIES FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S A KEY CHALLENGE FOR DISTRICTS AS THEY GEAR UP FOR THE EXPANSION. OF POTENTIALLY PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROPOSED ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IS A GOOD DOWN PAYMENT. BUT WE THINK THE BACKLOG IS LIKE THE EVEN LARGER THAN THAT. OR EVEN PROVIDING SOME KIND OF ONE TIME SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. I GIVEN THE DEMAND FOR ON GOING- FOR MAJOR CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION. I THAT ADDITIONAL FACILITY FUNDING COULD QUALIFY AS EXCLUDABLE CAPITAL OUTLAY UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AND THAT WOULD EASE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL STATE BUDGET. AND LASTLY WOULD POINT OUT THAT THAT DOESN'T CERTAINLY DOESN'T NEED TO COMPETE WITH ANY OF YOUR ON GOING PRIORITY IS- THAT COULD BE DONE ENTIRELY THROUGH SOME OF WERE REPURPOSED AND SOME OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS. ALLOWING ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS- FOR LCS AFTER OTHER AREAS THAT MIGHT BE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- SO WITH THAT GOTTEN MY COMMENTS- ACROSS ME I OTHER ITEMS AND SUBSEQUENT PANEL HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. BOB OKAY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SORRY MR FONG. I THINK THIS CHAIR- I WANTED TO- GO BACK GO FOCUS ON THE FACILITIES DISCUSSION I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH THAT WE DO NEED TO INCREASE- WHEN THAT ONE TIME FUNDING TO DEAL WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND- AND FACILITIES. YOU INDICATED THAT- AND THIS IS THE L. A- INDICATED. YOU DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS ON THE BACK LOG IS ARE THEIR NUMBERS OUT THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SIZE OF THE- OF THE BACKLOG WOULD BE. STATE DOESN'T COLLECT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION CURRENTLY AT SOMETHING YOU COULD START COLLECTING MAYBE AS A CONDITION OF DISTRICTS RECEIVING THIS FUNDING- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE STATE OF WROTE. ABOUT TEN YEAR PERIOD REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING DISTRICTS REQUIRED THIS SPEND ON MAINTAINING THEIR FACILITY IS- I THINK OF IT AT THAT TENURE AS A COUPLE AT LEAST A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS. AND SO BECAUSE AT THE STATE ONLY RECENTLY RESTORED THAT FACILITY SPENDING REQUIREMENT WE THINK THERE IS A FAIRLY SIZEABLE- BACKLOG. MAYBE THAT QUESTION IS MAYBE I OF- MAKE THAT SAME QUESTIONS APART FINANCE DO DO YOU HAVE- ANALYSIS OR A LIST OF WHAT THAT TO. BACKLOG IS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES SORRY FOR THAT- CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC LIST OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG I THINK AS IT RELATES TO THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM THERE CERTAINLY LIST OF THE PROJECTS- THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO OUT OR HAVE HAD. APPLICATION SUBMITTED THAT ARE ABOVE THE BONDING AUTHORITY THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THE L. A. AS- SUGGESTION OR RECOMMENDATION OF INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT GOES TO FACILITIES AND FOR MINUTES. CHOKE FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM WE THINK- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- PUTS FOR THREE POINT NINE BILLION A TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE. TO SUSTAIN THAT PROGRAM ENDED ITS CURRENT PACE AND YOU KNOW AND- ACCOUNTING FOR- CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX YOU KNOW TAKE CHANGES- THROUGH THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ON A CALENDAR YEAR- IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW BALANCING INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- THE- THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION TWO. YOU KNOW ASSISTANCE TRICKS IN IDENTIFYING- YOUR ADDRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT. I AS THE ANALYST POINTED OUT- ROUTINE RESTRICTED MAINTENANCE COUNCIL REQUIREMENTS HAVE RECENTLY BECOME ACTIVE AGAIN- AND THAT REPRESENTS ROUGHLY TWO POINT ONE TO TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL SPENDING- ON NOT MAINTENANCE EACH YEAR. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC YOU KNOW THOUGHT AS TO YOU SHOULD WE INCREASE- YOU KNOW THE SPENDING ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU KNOW WE THINK THE PACKAGE THAT WE PUT FORWARD IS A- YOU KNOW REASONABLE PACKAGE IN THE TOTALITY OF ALL OF THE PRIORITIES AND CALLS ON AVAILABLE FUNDING- I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE- I THINK THE L. A. O. IN AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM BEACH DO. DOES MAKE A COMPELLING CASE AND I THINK THAT WITH IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT. IT DOES PROVIDE AN ADDED BENEFIT- AS WELL SO JUST TO BE CLEAR. WITHIN THE MAY REVISION. IT'S A TOTAL OF THREE POINT NINE BILLION. SPECIFICALLY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS THAT CORRECT. BUT IT'S UP THREE POINT NINE BILLION SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM WHICH IS MODERNIZATION AND NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT IS SET SET ASIDE WORK ARE INVESTED IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SAY IT WOULD BE THREE POINT NINE PLUS ONE POINT EIGHT. BUDGET SO IT'S SO THE ONE POINT IT IS IN ADDITION TO THE THREE POINT NINE BUT IN TERMS. IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS WHAT COMES OUT OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS IS THAT IS THAT ONLY THE ONE POINT EIGHT. UNDER PROPOSITION EIGHT YES ONLY THE ONE TWENTY OKAY- IF I COULD QUICKLY GO TO YOU- BUT IT LET ME JUST ALSO ASK THIS BECAUSE IKNOW THAT THE CHAIR IS VERY FOCUSED ON ON TWENTY K. EXPANSION WITH. THE THOSE WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FACILITIES- MONIES WOULD THEY GO TO THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL. THAT WOULD BE GENERALLY A LOCAL DECISION AS TO HOW TO YOU KNOW DEPLOYED THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROCEEDS WITHIN THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM HOWEVER. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADDITIONAL AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE GENERATES ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY WITHIN THAT PROGRAM CERTAINLY THOSE DISTRICTS COULD APPLY TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. OKAY AND IN MY- MY LAST QUESTION MAYBE THIS IS THE COULD BE VALUED BY FINANCE- IT CAN SOMEONE SHED SOME LIGHT ABOUT THE INVEST. IN THE AT THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM SUPPORT. AND IS IT POSSIBLE IS THERE A NEED OR WHY WE ARGUE THERE'S A NEED TO INCREASE INVESTMENT BUT WHAT IS THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND- THE NFL AS ANY. ANALYSIS ON THAT. WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THAT AND THAT MORE IN THE NEXT SIX SECTION OKAY YOUR GESTURE HOLD OFF ON THAT QUESTION HERE. HOLD OFF ON THE NEXT DOWNTURN. IN AND INVEST. YEAH GO AHEAD RESTAURANTS- I MAKE IT MY QUESTION IS- BASICALLY OF TWO- IT'S WHAT IT IS FOR MY FIRST WAS FOR THE L. A. O- IS A LOT OF- A LOT OF GOOD THIS BUDGET I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- BUT I DO I DO HAVE A QUESTION WHEN I WHEN I. WHEN YOU ADD UP THE MONEY YEAH THAT ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME- HOW MUCH. IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. HOW MUCH OF THE ONGOING MONEY IS BEING USED FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES. FOUR AND A HALF BILLION WE ARE DEADLINE DOLLARS WITHIN K. TWELVE EDUCATION SO. WHEN I TALK ABOUT RAISING THE BASE. THAT FOUR AND A ALF BILLION DOLLARS. COULD GO TO RAISE THE BASE. THAT'S CORRECT OUR ESTIMATE I THINKWE'VE DONE IS THAT FOR EACH ONE PERCENT. INCREASE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LCF THAT COSTS SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION. HOW MUCH WAS RIGHT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION PER SEVEN MILLION 31% OF THE BASE YEAH. SO THERE'S A PRETTY HEAVY INCREASE SITTING OUT THERE. IN THAT FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SO I HOPE WITH THE BODY. WILL WELL LOOK TO THAT TO INCREASE THE BASE AND MAY PUT THOSE OTHER EXPENDITURES AND WHAT ARE TRULY ONE TIME MONIES- SO THAT I APPRECIATE MISTER. OKAY I DON'T. IT DES THE DOES THE DOES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. THE VERY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND DRIVING IT AWAY. IN SOME CASES FROM THE CLASSROOM- WOULD BE RATHER UNFORTUNATE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SAID DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE AS TO WHY YOU WOULD SCORE FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS FOR ONE TIME USE IS AS OPPOSED TO. ONGOING USES. YES CERTAINLY A AT A AT THE HIGHEST OF LEVELS YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE- ELLIE- DURING THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW WE DO ATTEMPT TO BUILD IN SOME LEVEL OF ONE TIME RESOURCES OUT OF THE ON GOING. AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO BALANCE AGAINST INEVITABLE DOWNTURNS OR- VARIATIONS IN THE STATE ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE- AND THAT IS ONE- TOOL THAT WE CAN LOOK TOWARD SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW POTENTIAL- VARIATION IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW IT WOULD HELP MITIGATE- YOU KNOW AGAINST POTENTIAL CUTS POTENTIAL ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE- OR COULD HAVE TO CONSIDER- IN A FUTURE BUDGET. WELL I GUESS MY RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE. WE HAVE RESERVES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHICH ARE HEALTHY. LEVEL AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THOSE RESERVES- IN TIMES. AND THOSE ARE NEWER RESERVES RIGHT FOR THE MOST PART- OPPOSITION TO ACCEPT HER PASSED BY THE VOTERS TO ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE THOSE RESERVES. AND WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD WERE SO RELUCTANT TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE OF A DOWNTURN YEAH WE ALREADY HAVE. INSURANCE AGAINST THAT DOWNTURN AND RESERVES- I DON'T THINK THE VOTERS WHEN THEY VOTED. FOR THOSE RESERVE SIDE WELL. MAYBE THEY'LL BELIEVE IN SAVE EVEN MORE BY CREATING THEIR OWN RESERVE. BY TAKING ONGOING MONIES AND PARKING THEM. FOR ONE TIME USES SO I JUST THINK THAT THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A RATHER UNFORTUNATE PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT SHORTCHANGES THE CLASSROOM. YEAH BEFORE YOU GET TO MISS REYES JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE BELT AND SUSPENDERS WITH RECORD LEVELS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVES AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRAW DOWN ON THAT BECAUSE THEY PUT SO MUCH IN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND COULDN'T SPEND IT CAN HIRE PEOPLE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE SO WE BUILT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE SO WHEN WE GET PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY WE COULD SPEND IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT AN AUSTERITY BUDGET RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THE SKY IS FALLING THAT. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. WE HAVE THESE TWO THINGS BUILT IN SOME. I UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR'S- PRESENTATION THE OTHER DAY TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT WITH. ONE TIME MONEY CAPITAL GAINS IN ALICE'S FROM TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE DOT COM CRASH BUT AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE PUT IN PLACE. THE SYSTEMS TO PROTECT US FROM THERE FROM THAT AND SO- I THINK AS WELL HAVE A BIT TOO MUCH IN- ONE TIME AND NOT ENOUGH AN ONGOING BASED UPON- THERE NEEDS SENSE YOU KNOW ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS ONE THING BUT THE ONE TIME WE PUT OUT ALL THESE CATEGORICAL THEY ALL SOUND GOOD BUT IT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE- GOT AWAY WITH TEN YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO GIVE DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY AND FOCUS ON ON THEIR NEEDS AND EVEN MORE SO. SECOND THIS RELAYED THE GUARANTEE IN NINETY EIGHT. A LOT OF THE ONE TIME CATEGORICAL STAFFER FOR THESE IDEAS- WITH OTHER COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT ARE GOOD IDEAS BUT YOU HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE. AND DISTRICTS ARE LEERY ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE ALWAYS FOR THAT BECAUSE THE ONE THEY WANT A FULL TIME JOB SO- I JUST THINK WE- LEARN THIS LESSON. AND THE MAX AMOUNT WE CAN GIVE. TO DISTRICTS WITH MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY- IS THE PREFERRED OPTION. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. FORGET MY QUESTION I THINK THAT. THE BILL THE STAFF WANTS FULL TIME. WORK BUT THEY ALSO WON'T BE PAID PROPERLY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THAT WE'RE EXPECTING PEOPLE TO WORK. TO WE GIVE THEM FUNDING FOR JUST. ONE TIME. THEY WANT TO HIRE THE BEST BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY CAN'T KEEP THEM OF THE CAN'T PAY THEM PROPERLY. BUT MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN THE ALLEY- REPORT ONE EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SHOULD BE HIGHER AND YOU SAID THAT THE BACKLOG. IS LIKELY LARGER THAN THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DETERMINE HOW MUCH LARGER THAT IS AND WHY AREN'T WE ACCOUNTING FOR IT. YES SO ONE OF THE WAYS WE'VE TRYING TO ANSWER THAT IS TO LOOK AT WELL WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT DISTRICTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE UNDER THE HISTORICAL STANDARD WHICH IS YOU SET ASIDE 3% OF YOUR BUDGET FOR MAINTENANCE AND WHAT THE STATE. ALLOWED THEM TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT THE PAST TEN YEARS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER- I THINK MY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STILL KIND OF LOOKING INTO THAT. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE GOING AT FIRST GLANCE IT THAT'S A BIT LARGER THAT'S MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION- IN TERMS OF MONEY THAT. ORDINARILY WOULD HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR MAINTENANCE BUT- WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL RELIEF THE LEGISLATURE. TO PROVIDE. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION YEARS. YEAH MMHM MY NEXT QUESTION I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO PHRASE IT AS ELOQUENTLY AS I SHOULD. BUT I'VE HI RIGHT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MANY OF OUR- POOR SCHOOLS. DON'T REPORT WHAT IT IS THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FACILITIES ARE SO USED TO MAKING DO WITH WHAT THEY HAVE. AND THE FACILITIES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER WRONG THEY'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY NEED TO BRING IT UP TO THE LEVEL THEY HAD TO THAT. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- THAT WE SHOULD DO TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE COMMUNITIES THOSE FACILITIES ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT MOST NEED IT THEN GET TO THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR WHATEVER ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO PROPERLY PRESENT WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO BRING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND BRING THE FACILITIES UP TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IN THE NEXT PANEL ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE COMMENTS BUT- THIS IS OFTEN A FRUSTRATION THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A- STATE WIDE INVENTORY OF THE NEEDS AND KIND OF FACILITY CONDITION OF DISTRICTS. THAT SOMETHING- THE STATE COULD THINK ABOUT- POTENTIALLY ASKING DISTRICTS REPORT MAYBE AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THIS FUNDING- YEAH WE DON'T HAVE A- LIKE A- SPECIFIC. RECOMMENDATION AT THIS POINT BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE THINKING ABOUT- AND THAT POTENTIALLY COULD START TO ADDRESS THAT KIND OF INFORMATION GAP THAT WE HAVE EVERY YEAR. AND IF I COULD- YOU KNOW ADD ON TO THE SORT OF EQUITY LINES THAT THAT YOU- NOTED MEMBER- I WOULD NOTE THAT- IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO DISTRIBUTE THESE FUNDS. UTILIZES THE UNDUPLICATED PERCENTAGES THE END TO PLACATED ENROLLMENT COUNTS- TO JUST ALLOCATE THOSE RESOURCES TO DISTRICTS. SO THROUGH THE ALLOCATION METHOD OF THAT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE GOING TOWARD. YOU KNOW THOSE SCHOOL SERVING HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF YOU KNOW UNDERGRAD UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. MY NOTE THAT IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO BUT TO RIGHT WHEN WE LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH INEQUITY LANCE WINDOW. EQUITY DOES NOT EXIST OFTENTIMES BECAUSE- THOSE SCHOOLS THAT NEED IT THE MOST. ARE NOT THE MOST VOCAL- AND THEY DON'T GET THEIR EQUITABLE SHARE OF. THAT WHAT IS NEEDED BY THEM AND WHAT TO IT THAT THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM THEIR STUDENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM TREMENDOUSLY IF THEY WERE TO RECEIVE. THE EQUITABLE- SHARE OF THE FUNDING IT'S STILL AN ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS BUT I THINK HAVING A STATE WIDE INVENTORY. I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD BEGINNING AND IT TOO TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING THAT IS NECESSARY SO THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED- SO THAT WHEN WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. ONLY BECAUSE THEY- MAYBE THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY DESERVE IT OR THEY FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN USED TO DOING WHAT THEY DID WITH SO LITTLE. THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND- WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO PROVIDE. A MORE EQUITABLE SHARE FOR THOSE THAT MOST NEED IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER.

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I ALSO HAVE MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES AVAILABLE IN THE ROOM AND ON WEBEX ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION LETTER THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU L. A. L. GOOD AFTERNOON A GROUP ROLE WITH THE WITH THE L. A. I'M I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH OUR COMMENTS ON FOUR OF THE DIFFERENT- K. TWELVE- PROPOSAL THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED YET- BUT WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING HANDOUT. OR- EVERYONE GETS ONE ONE VARIETY MORE CONTEXT TO. FIRST ON THE PROPOSAL FOR CHILD NUTRITION SO THERE'S A PROPOSED IN THE MIRROR VISION TO INCREASE THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR. A TELEVISION PROGRAMS BY ASSEMBLY SIXTY THREE CENTS PER MEAL. AND THAT'S INTENDED TO- PROVIDE OVERALL FUNDING FOR MEALS- EQUIVALENT TO THE- RATES THAT WERE PROVIDED DURING- DURING THE PANDEMIC BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'M READING FROM INCREASES IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE REASONABLE GIVEN THE COST PRESSURES THAT NUTRITION PROGRAMS HAVE FACED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- WE DO THINK OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE A- RECOMMENDATION DEPENDING ON ITS PRIORITIES. WE WOULD RECOMMEND ARE REJECTING- THE ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSAL THAT'S TO REALLOCATE ANY UNUSED FUNDING FOR KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE- EXISTENCE ABOUT UNSPENT FUNDS WITHIN CAN BE MADE IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND THERE'S ALREADY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MIRROR VISION. ON EXTENDED AND EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMS SO THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL WOULD ACT- MODIFY THE JUNIOR PROPOSAL SO THAT WOULD BE. ONE UNIFORM FUNDING RATE STRUCTURE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER- UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE THAT'S IN GREAT STICKY THREE SIX THAT MEANS AN ENGLISH LEARNER A LONG TIME STUDENT. THE THING GREAT TICKET THREE SIX- WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING A UNIFORM RATE- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE DID MR SHOULD HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR- TWO TIERED REQUIREMENTS. FOR WHICH STUDENTS NEED TO BE SERVED UNDER THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM. WE WOULD RECOMMEND AS WITH A UNIFORMED FUNDING RIGHT THERE BE UNIFORM SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND SPECIFICALLY RECOMMEND. ARE REQUIRING THAT THAT DISTRICTS MUST SERVE ANY INTERESTED OUR LOW INCOME RTL STUDENT. IN THE DISTRICT- AB BUT NOT HAVE TO SERVE ALL STUDENTS RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT WORKS. THANK YOU THE HIGHER YOU UCBCP DISTRICTS ARE ARE NOT GETTING MORE MONEY BUT HAVE HIGHER REQUIREMENTS- IN THE PROGRAM. I'M AND THEN IN TERMS OF ARTS AND ONE FUNDING THE EXTRA LEARNING IN. PROGRAM THERE'S AN AUGMENTATION IN THE MIRROR VISION WE CONTINUE TO. RECOMMEND THAT YOU REJECT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT. THERE WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF UNSPENT EXPANDED LEARNING FUNDING IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT. DISTRICTS WILL WILL TAKE TIME TO EXPAND THEPROGRAM AND THEY'RE RECEIVING SUCH A FULL IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING. IN THE COMING BUDGET YEAR SO WE THINK ANY UNSPENT FUNDS OF THOSE COULD BE USED. TO COVER THOSE COSTS. I'M ON THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS RELATED TO MATH SCIENCE AND EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANTS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING ALL OF THOSE- THERE WERE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET INCLUDE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN. PROFESSIONAL DAHLE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING THROUGH THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- THE CONFUSED OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD AND IN ADDITION. TO ALL OF THE OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WAS CRIED DURING THE PANDEMIC CAN BE USED FOR SO I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL- THE WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE WE DON'T THINK THERE'S AN I NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE. I'M AND THEN FINALLY ON ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AN ISSUE THAT WAS. DISCUSSED EARLIER I THINK I WOULD ADD A LITTLE. MORE CONTACT ON THE ON HOW WE GOT TO THE BACKLOG- I'M THIRTY WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT SOME OF THE DATA MOVING BACK BUT AND- IT BY LOOKING AT THE FEW YEARS THAT WE HAVE- WHEN WE HAVE THESE. LOWER REQUIREMENTS. IF YOU LOOK TO US LIKE IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN LESS SPENDING THE DISTRICTS HAD ON- ON ON MAINTENANCE DURING THE PERIOD WE PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY. THE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN PLACE FOR ROUGHLY TEN YEARS SO WE THINK THAT. IT'S VERY. WELL COULD BE THAT IT'S IN THE MIDDLE MORE IF MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS- TO GET THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE EXACT NUMBERS AND WE CAN. SHARE MORE OF YOUR MONEY TO SO THAT'S- PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR. WHY WE SAY YOU CAN DO MORE- TO ADDRESS THAT. HIGHER HIGHER BACKLOG. RIGHT ONE OTHER THING I'LL POINT OUT THAT THE WITH. DIFFERENT FUNDING WOULD GO OUT IN EITHER OF THE CASES IT'S BASED ON. THE DISTRICTS SAYING THESE ARE NEED SORRY WHAT IT WOULDN'T CREATE- WOULDN'T CREATE THIS- SYSTEM WHERE. DEPENDING ON HOW THEY CLASSIFY THESE COSTS. THEY WOULD BE REWARDED OR PENALIZED AS A RESULT SO- BUT WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS TO USE- THE NUMBER OF. THE T. ELLER LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND DISTRICT TO DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. WE WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND USING A DIFFERENT APPROACH USING LIKE THE TAXABLE. VALUE OF A STRICT. IN PROVIDED AMHERST UNTIL MORE BOB TAX VALUE IN DISTRICT. I WAS THOSE. GIVE MORE FUNDING THAN THOSE WITH HARPER TAX BUT BECAUSE OF. FROM WHY ISN'T THAT THE MORE DIRECT. RELATIONSHIP WITH. A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS IF. OFTENTIMES THERE ARE DISTRICTS HAVE LOWER. PROP VALUE ARE THAT ARE. MORE CONSTRAINED IN THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL BOND REVENUE AND THEN HAVE. HIGHER I MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE TO FACILITIES. I'M WORKING WITH MY COMMENTS FROM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY I NEVER GO BACK TO MR FONG IN A SPECIFIC QUESTION HERE FOR THESE PROPOSALS. YEAH. NOTHING TO SHARE SO MY SPECIFIC QUESTION IS IT OR THE PACIFIC TOPICAL IN DISCUSSES THAT STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT DIFFERENTIATED SYSTEMS WHAT IS THE CURRENT INVESTMENT IN THAT SYSTEM. GOOD AFTERNOON AMBER ALEXANDER- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE ARE- SEVERAL INVESTMENTS IN THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AT GLOBALLY BUT THE FOR THE DIFFERENT SHOULD ASSISTANCE INVESTMENT SPECIFICALLY. IN CURRENT YEAR THERE SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION AND IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR THERE SIXTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION IN THAT SPECIFIC FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT THEIR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WORK. I'M THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION THAT WE HAVE A BUILT INTO THE TO THE BUDGET YEAR AS A PLACE HOLDER IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT COUNTY OFFICES WILL SOON- BEGIN OFFERING. THAT SUPPORT TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR DIFFERENT SHOULD ASSISTANCE- UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DASH BOARD IS NOT YET OUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS- WILL WILL KIND OF FALL INTO THAT TIER. SO WE WILL DO A CURRENT YEAR ADJUSTMENT IN THE FALL- WHICH WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE TYPICALLY DO TO TRUE UP THAT DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE THEM OUT TO ENSURE THAT IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE FULL NUMBER THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. ZA ROUGHLY. SIX RECORD TO SEVENTY SIX SIXTY EIGHT OR AT TO SEVENTY FOR THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION PORTION THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ENTITIES- THAT ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THERE'S THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE. I'M WHICH IS A ROUGHLY A TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT- THERE'S ALSO OUR OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- VARIOUS THAT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. PROVIDES SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. SO IT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THE SYSTEMS PEOPLE ROUGHLY SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TO SEVENTY SO CERTAINLY A I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOW IT'S A CAN OF A YEAR ROUND CHALLENGE- IT HISTORICALLY I MEAN. I GUESS THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS THAT BINDING GONE. OR BEEN PRETTY. WHAT THE WHAT IS THE TREND. THAT THE FORMULA FOR DIFFERENT INSISTENCE IS CALLED OUT AND STATUTES SO IT'S BASED ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE- AND IT'S BASED ON TO BE- THAT NUMBER OF A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE DASHBOARD. BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD HAS BEEN- OFFICIALLY OFFICIALLY PAUSE BECAUSE OF- ASSESSMENTS NOT OCCURRING DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT HAS BEEN FLAT THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. FLUCTUATING BECAUSE OF THE DASHBOARD RESULTS- FOR MANY FLAT. BUT IN IN THE FUTURE AS- AS MORE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE COULD BE FLUCTUATIONS- DEPENDING ON THOSE DASHBOARD RESULTS. DO YOU ANTICIPATE A ADDED DO YOU ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN IN THE SPACE THAT WE DO- WE DO TRUE UP THE FORMULA EVERY YEAR AGAIN IT S BASED ON THAT THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE SO YOU KNOW ASK THE DASHBOARD- RESULTS OF PRINT OFFICIALLY BECOME ON PASTA I'M COMING OFF OF THE PANDEMIC WE WILL SEE THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN AGAIN THE FORMULA WILL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON A ROLLING AVERAGE SO THERE THERE WILL BE I AM NATURAL FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH THAT PROCESS. OKAY BUT THERE'S NO THERE'S NO THE YOU CAN INFUSE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME MONIES INTO THIS OR OR WOULD YOU OR CAN YOU SAID THAT THE STATUTE- IN TERMS OF THE FOR THE FORMULA IS EFFECT OBVIOUSLY NOTHING WOULD PROHIBIT AN ADJUSTMENT- BEING MADE OUTSIDE OF THE FORMULA- SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR- FOR LIKE THE CHARTER DIFFERENT ADDRESSES AND FAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE FORMULA- AT THIS POINT BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE IDENTIFIED I'M RECOGNIZING THAT IN THE FUTURE IT WILL BECOME PART OF THAT. DEBT FREE A ROLLING AVERAGE GOING FORWARD. OKAY BUT WE SHOULD INFORMATION THEY GIVE A MUCH. K. QUESTION. I'LL BE A FEW QUESTIONS TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD THE BIG DISCUSSION ON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND WHAT'S THE REASON RATIONALE FOR PUTTING THEM INCREASE RIGHT HERE WE'RE JUST KIND OF ROLLING IT OUT. I KNOW WE HAVE MONEY TO SPEND AND TO FINANCE DELEO SAYS THEY WILL. THAT PRESUMABLY FOLK BETTER FOCUS HAVE ONE TIME THEN I'M GOING. TO THE BASE ITSELF WE HAVE A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT THERE BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS FOR COMMITTEE SCHOOLS. ALL FINISHERS HANG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS BASED OFF OF THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM THE FIRST ROUND OF PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS WE THOUGHT. AND HIGH DEMAND FOR THE IT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL GRANTS AND WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING IT THERE TO BE AN INCREASE IN INTEREST AND APPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE AROUND THE PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION GRANT SO GIVEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS WE AND- ASSUME THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS NEEDED. AND ARE CONTENT TO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS TO EXPAND THE ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANTS TO EVERY ELIGIBLE ALLOCATE THAT WISHES TO APPLY. HELLO YES- THIS IS ONE THAT WE- WE DO WE DO THINK THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR THE ESTIMATE THAT FINANCING IN TERMS OF OUR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ED. PUT TOGETHER IN TERMS OF THE AFTERMATH. WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OF THE IF YOU WANT TO FIND ALL INTERESTED- SCHOOLS YOU MIGHT NEED TO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AS OF DECEMBER WE DO SOME AUGMENTATIONS HERE. COULD BE- COULD BE REASONABLE TO ADD- I THINK WE WERE NOT THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE THAT AMOUNT AND FUNDING FOR OTHER PRIORITIES. I THINK BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED GRANT CYCLES WE DO THINK THAT IF THERE WAS SOME. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT YOU NEED IT WOULD NECESSARY NEED TO BE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO YOU CAN REVISIT THIS NEXT YEAR AS WELL IF THEIR WORK IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU. WANTED TO- TO LOOK AT NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU HAVE BETTER INFORMATION ON THE NEXT ROUND OF ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION WAS ONE WORD. IF THERE WAS INTEREST IN IN IN IN MAKING SURE THERE WAS PLENTY AVAILABLE WE DO THINK. THE pREASONABLE BUT- IN TERMS OF WHAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF A- GIVEN THAT GIVEN THAT WE'RE STILL EARLY ON IN THE IN THE GRANT PROCESS. AND THEN- AS FAR AS THE THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR THE HOLDING HARMLESS FOR THE ADDITIONAL YEAR. YEAH THIS IS BASED UPON THE PREMISE THAT THERE WAS ONE TIME IMPACT HERE FOR THE PANDEMIC AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE OVERALL. DECLINING ENROLLMENT- IN GENERAL. AND SO THERE WAS ANY FUSION OF FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT SO. WHAT WHY WHY THEY NEEDED TO GO BACK AND JUSTICE BY CAN'T WE JUST USE THE PERMITTED. BASICALLY SOFTEN OUT. THE IMPACT FOR THE ONE TIME DROP. RETURNABLE FOR THE FOR THE HEALTHY OF ATTENDANCE THE- YEAH I- YEAH I THINK I THINK THE SO THE DISTRICTS RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THEY COULD USE FOR A READY FOR THIS IS IT THAT IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THE TITLE ONE FORMULA THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN. THE ADDRESSING DECLINES IN ATTENDANCE I THINK THE WAY WE DO NOT CONSIDER THAT WE THOUGHT THAT DEMONSTRATION PROPOSAL WAS REASONABLE WITH REGARDS TO ALFIE AFFECTED THAT SUCH A THING. WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU BASED ON. HOW MANY KIDS ARE ENROLLED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME THAT THEY'RE ATTENDING AT THE RATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THAT SEEM TO US. TO BE A REASONABLE WAY TO. PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN A WAY THAT'S- FILL THE STILL YOU'RE CONNECTED TO STUDENTS. TO NUMBER THIRTY THREE BY. RECOGNIZING THAT THE ATTENDANCE THIS YEAR IS JUST. YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY LOW IS DOWN. 8% STATEWIDE- IN THE INITIAL- ATTENDANCE ESTIMATES. NUTS BEFORE ON THE GROUND- AND WITH SO WE THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. WE KNOW THAT THESE THESE CHANGES IN ATTENDANCE IN THIS YEAR ARE REALLY. REALLY DUE TO FACTORS OUTSIDE OF DISTRICTS CONTROL. THE FINANCE WHAT TO ADDRESS THAT IS ACTUALLY WHY THEY NEED TO PUT. ADDITIONAL MONEY IN HERE VERSUS. ALLOWING THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO USE THAT ONE TIME FEDERAL MONEY. TO SOFTEN THE BLOW. SO IF I MAY UM CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE AGAIN I THINK THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT THERE'S A ONE TIME COMPONENT THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR- CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY HAD THAT- CAPABILITY A OR THAT YOU KNOW- ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF ADJUSTMENT AND THEN IN THE ONGOING BASIS. WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO SMOOTH OUT DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN DISTRICTS SO BY APPLYING- THE ABA STANDARD THAT WE HAVE- YOU'RE SMOOTHING OUT THE STATE FUNDING FOR THOSE DISTRICTS OVER TIME- WITHOUT THAT YOU WOULD SEE A NATURAL DECLINE IN L. C. F. F. FUNDING- COULD SOME DISTRICTS HAVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH AND IT IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE MAY BE A HANDFUL DISTRICTS OUT THERE THAT DO HAVE- FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT WERE UP PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO THEM. THERE WILL BE OTHER DISTRICTS HOWEVER BECAUSE THE FEDERAL FORMULA FOR THE PRIMARY ALLOCATION MR FUNDING RELIED UPON TITLE ONE COUNTS. THERE ARE OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DID NOT HAVE A HIGH TITLE ONE COUNTS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE- SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE FEDERAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM TO TRY AND MITIGATE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A DECLINE IN- ATTENDANCE. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY ON THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS FOR FINANCE FOR THIS MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES. AND HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY- RECONCILE WITH THE ACTUAL. MEAL COSTS. YOU'RE LISTENING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO CURRENTLY SCHOOLS ARE RECEIVING IN THE HANDS RATES AND ALSO ABLE TO SERVE MEALS TO ALL STUDENTS WITHOUT COLLECTING ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION SO THESE TWO WAIVERS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE ARE PROPOSING TO BASICALLY BACK FILLED THAT THOSE FEDERAL FINANCED RATES- BY INCREASING THE BASE FOR THE STATE MEAL PROGRAM SO SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE GET THAT BUT DOES THAT ACTUALLY JIVE WITH THE TRUE COSTS. OF WHAT THEY ARE. IT IS IT WARRANTED FOR THIS INCREASE I'M OF COURSE WE LOVE SCHOOL MEALS WE DID LAST YEAR UNIVERSAL OVER FOR THAT. BUT- MAYBE IT'S FAR QUESTION FOR L. A. R. D. IF YOU THINK THAT THIS WARRANTS THIS INCREASE VERSUS THE ACTUAL TRUE COSTS I DON'T THINK WE CAN SPECIFY YOU HAVE A DIFF IT HAVE TO BE JUST ABOUT WE DO THINK YOU'RE EVEN BEFORE THE YEAR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS A PROPOSAL IN. JANUARY BUDGET TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE MODEST ARE INCREASED TO THE STATE RATE INSIDE THAT TIME WE DID LOOK INTO A LITTLE BIT OF. THE PROGRAMAND AT THAT TIME WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PRESSURES IN THE NUTRITION PROGRAM BECAUSE AS LCF IS GROWING SUBSTANTIALLY. AND STAFF SALARIES WERE GROWING THE PROGRAM ITSELF WAS ONLY GETTING COLD SO AT THAT TIME WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS REASONABLE TO ADD A TO PROVIDE A RATE INCREASE. SINCE THEN WE ALSO NOW HAVE- YOU KNOW. SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT INFLATION WITH REGARDS TO FOOD PRICES SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON TO THINK THAT THAT THAT THE EXISTING RATES MAYBE- THAT WE COULD INCREASE THE STATE RATE THAT TO HELP PROVIDE OF. THESE COST PRESSURES NOW CAN WE SAY THAT THE SIXTY SENSE OF THE RIGHT AMOUNT THAT I THINK IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND THROW UP AND PER OR THAT WE DO THINK FROM AUGMENTATION IS REASONABLE BUT- WE THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PRIORITIES TO. USE THAT FOR OTHER ONGOING BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT COULD. MAKE SENSIBLE. OKAY QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE. FROM THE- PROPOSALS. KEPT SAYING NINE. ISSUE NUMBER THREE STATE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS. CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE- SO- THE- MADE PROVISION PROPOSES SIX MILLION ONE TIME- GENERAL FUND AT THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE OVER A THREE YEAR SO TWO MILLION PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS- SPECIFICALLY THESE FUNDS WOULD YOU KNOW HELP THE- SUMMER SCHOOL YOU KNOW I'M- MITIGATE- COST PRESSURES THAT THEY'RE FACING- IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL BUDGET WOULD ALSO HELP THEM- SUPPORT YOU KNOW SCHOLARSHIPS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS OVER THE SUMMER- I BELIEVE THE- TUITION- IF IT MUST BE PAID. UP FOR STUDENTS. FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS RIGHT NOW- AND SO- THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL JUST TO ALLOW THE FROM SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS TO ENROLL ADDITIONAL STUDENT SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS- WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THEY TOO WERE FACING COST PRESSURES. WE DOMINATE COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL. A SMALL PROPOSAL IN THE RELATIVE SCHEME OF THINGS QUESTIONS MISTER DONNA. YEAH I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS THIS PROPOSAL I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFUSED HERE. YOU TALKED ABOUT TUITION. IS THIS ONE SCHOOL IN ONE PLACE IS. A GRANT PROGRAM I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WE'RE GIVING. WE'RE ALLOCATING IN THE STATE BUDGET MONEY FOR ONE SCHOOL. TO HAVE SUMMER SCHOOL. SO AT WHAT THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS IS ACTUALLY A SPECIFIC PROGRAM THAT STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAN APPLY TO ATTEND OVER THE SUMMER IT'S DEFINITELY ARTS FOCUSED- IT I BELIEVE IT'S A FOUR WEEK COURSE UP FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE ABLE TO ATTEND I IN ANY GIVEN YEAR THE SUMMER SCHOOL ATTEMPTS TO I ENROLLED AT LEAST AROUND FIVE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS- THERE IS A TUITION COMPONENT SO THERE THERE BUDGET IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT TUITION COVERS PART OF THE COST. AND STATE GENERAL FUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS DISCOVERED ANOTHER PORTION OF THE COSTS OF THEIR IT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT I BELIEVE THEIR BASE BUDGET- IN GENERAL FUND TERMS IS AROUND ONE POINT FOUR MILLION- IN YOU'LL THE EACH YEAR SO THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE INTENDED TO YOU KNOW HELP THE SCHOOL SERVE THAT SAME COHORT FOCUS ON SERVING. STUDENTS FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES- SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL- WITHOUT YOU KNOW HAVING TO SEE THE SCHOOL INCREASED TUITION OR YOU KNOW REDUCE ACCESS TO STUDENTS. THIS IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL. THE CHARGES TUITION FOR THE SUMMER PROGRAM. IT'S A IT'S A PUBLIC SUMMER PROGRAM BUT IT'S NOT A SCHOOL IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE THAT WE THINK OF A YEAR ROUND SCHOOL SO IT'S NOT SUMMER SPECIFIC IT THERE ARE FOUR- FULL TIME EMPLOYEES THAT OPERATE THE PROGRAM AND SET UP THE SUMMER PROGRAM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND BUT IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DO WE IS IT IS IT'S A ONE SITE. RIGHT GOT IT I BELIEVE IT'S AT ONE SITE- I FORGET THE EXACT LOCATION I BELIEVE IT'S SINCE OUTS FRANTICALLY RITA. OKAY AND- DO WE KNOW WHAT THE STUDENT POPULATIN THE STUDENT MAKE UP IS THERE IS A DIVERSITY. CHOI I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE- AVAILABLE ON WEBEX BUT I WOULD I TURN TO YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS I BELIEVE THEY ARE ON- AND AVAILABLE. I CAN HAVE A I DON'T NEED THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. I JUST. ASSUME THAT A LOT OF MONEY FOR A SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM TO ME- AND THE TWO THIRDS TWO MILLION A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. THAT'S CORRECT. THE TWO MILLION INTO TE TWO TUITIONS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND YOU SAID. YEAH A LITTLE UNDER I BELIEVE IT'S FIVE FORTY SEVEN FIFTY PER YEAR BUT WE'LL GET YOU THE EXACT AMOUNT IT'S JUST AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY AN AWFUL LOT OF STUDENTS. I TO GET YOU UP TO TWO MILLION I WOULD IMAGINE SO. YEAH THANK YOU I GET MISTER DODD I THINK THE THING FOR ME IS LESS THE ISSUE BUT- PRIOR WITH WE START TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED. PLUS BILLION DOLLARS IN TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS NINETY EIGHT AND WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA AND HERE WE HAVE. SPENDING OUR TIME TALKING ABOUT ONE. SCHOOL AND SENATE. IT'S A ONE OFF IN THE STATE BUDGET AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS CAME ABOUT BUT- IF I MAY MISTER YEAH. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DEATH ONE SCHOOL. IS GETTING MONEY FOR AN ARTS PROGRAM. K. TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS AREN'T GETTING MONEY FOR AN ARTS PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE DOING A CARVE OUT FOR ONE SCHOOL. AND I'M NOT CONVINCED. THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I MEAN HOW MUCH IS IT NEXT TIME. AND INTO OUR WE HAVE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS START PROGRAMS WHERE THEY COME UP AND WANT THEIR MONEY FOR THEIR ONE THING. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. LCF BUT- I'VE SAID MY PIECE. I WILL SAY THAT IT WAS YOU KNOW THIS INVESTMENT WAS PUT FORWARD BY THE ADMINISTRATION IT IS NOT. A YOU KNOW A SPECIFIC REQUEST THAT CAME FROM THE SCHOOL- AND CHEER CHEER BROADER POINT A BROWNED- ACCESS TO ARTS AND- MUSIC. EDUCATION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD A ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPOSAL- TO SUPPORT ARTS AND MUSIC EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM- AT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. RIGHT AND I WOULD. SO THEY COULD USE THAT MONEY WANT ONE COULD% ARGUE THAT. I SAID MY PIECE SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO A MEMBER REQUEST TYPE THING BUT HE'S HERE IN OUR CHEN IN TODAY FOR WHATEVER REASON. BECAUSE THE MINISTRATION HAS HAS A PRIORITY IN ITSELF WE GET IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER S. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH THAT THIS THIS IS CONCERNING ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T KNOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE STUDENT BODY THE GETS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A PRESTIGIOUS OUR ARTS PROGRAM THANK ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WOULD LIKE TO BE PARTICIPATING IN A PROGRAM WITH THE TUITION OF ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- THEY HAVE THE STATE. SUBSIDIZE IT. ALL THE STUDENTS IN MY DISTRICT CERTAINLY DESERVE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO JUST WANTED TO VOICE MY- WE HAVE MY THOUGHTS ON THAT WE AGREE. OKAY WE'LL HOLD THAT ISSUE OPEN. PANEL MEMBER FOR THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. WHAT IS THE- THREE. OKAY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMERICANS ABOUT THE PERMIT OF FINANCE I'LL BE COVERING INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S TEACHER CAREER PIPELINE AT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING INCLUDED IN THE MEMBER VISION THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN INCREASE IN RESOURCES AT THE COMMISSION OF ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND ELEVEN POSITIONS THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR AND ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NINE POSITIONS ON GOING THERE AFTER TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PREPARATION AND LICENSURE. COMMITTEES THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. TO AUGMENT THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT TEACHER AND SCHOOL COUNSELOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THIS BUT EXCUSE ME I'M PARKING UP. THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR ENCUMBRANCE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN MAY BE USED TO ESTABLISH NEW SCHOOL COUNSELOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS OR ADD THEM TO EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS. AND SCHOOL COUNSELORS AT THE COMMISSION ART RATHER SCHOOL COUNSELORS THAT THE COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THAT SERVE COUNSELORS IN TRAINING- FINALLY- I'M SORRY. ADDITIONALLY THE EMAIL REVISION PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR THE COMMISSION TO SELECT A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY TO SERVE AS A STATEWIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER. TO SUPPORT TEACHER AND SCHOOL COUNSELOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH INPUT FROM INTEREST HOLDERS TO CREATE A STATE WIDE FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSFUL TEACHER AND SCHOOL THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND SUSTAINABILITY. FINALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONE TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. TO SUPPORT THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO CONTINUE ADMINISTERING THE CALIFORNIA CENTER ON TEACHING CAREERS- THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MENTAL NOTE THAT THE COMMISSION IS ALSO ON THE LINE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO. FEDERAL WITH ELEGANT. SO WE ARE COMING FROM THREE PROPOSALS IN THE C. D. C. BUDGET FIRST IT'S- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS. AND WE DO WE DO THINK THAT THE JET OF OUR DOCUMENTATION IS PREMATURE GIVEN THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET STILL HAS NOT BEEN AWARDED- AND WE DO THINK THAT. INCLUDING FOR THE NEW SCHOOL COUNCIL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. WE WONDER WHETHER WOULD HAVE LIMITED BENEFITS GIVEN THAT SCHOOL COUNSELING IS NOT AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A CHRONIC SHORTAGE- AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF THERE WOULD BE INTEREST. IN SCHOOL TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS GIVEN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A- SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES IN THIS IN THIS AREA. ON THE TEACHER RESIDENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER WE WOULD- THOSE LIBERALS TWENTY MILLION OVER SEVEN YEARS. WE WOULD RECOMMEND. DOING TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS AND THEN AT THAT TIME GIVING. LEGISLATURE OPPORTUNITY TO. REVISIT THAT THE FUNDING IN DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THAT THE SECOND- A TEN MILLION DOLLARS IF THE DEFENDERS EFFECTIVE. AND FINALLY THERE'S A PROPOSAL- REGARDING- A READING AND LITERACY STUFF ON AUTHORIZATION TO PROVIDE INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE AUTHORIZATION- WITH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. WE THINK FOR. THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- WOULD BE WE ARE WE THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THAT WOULD BE SPENT WE RECOMMEND REDUCING BY HALF TO SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION. EVEN WITH THE THIRD AND A HALF MILLION THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER AUTHORIZATION FACT BACKER THAT DIRECTS YOU TO THE TYPICALLY. AUTHORIZES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. I'M BACKING WITH MY COMMENTS AT ANSWERED. OKAY THANK YOU A COUPLE. HI HOW THE GATE SO LAST YEAR WE HAD THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE SOME OF THE SMALLER. PIECES HERE TODAY AND- WHAT IS BEING- PURSUED THIS YEAR WHICH COULDN'T BE- ADDRESSED DURING THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH WE HAVEN'T FRANKLY SPENT. KALLADA YET. SACRAMENTO FINANCER YEAH YEAH SO- CHIEFLY AND THERE IS AN INVESTMENT IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN MATH AND SCIENCE- IT'S A MATH AND SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE- I'M SO INCLUDED IN THAT INVESTMENT IS THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO AUGMENT RESOURCES TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING- THROUGH THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT AND IN ITS AND SCIENCE AND MATH PRIORITIZING- THOSE TWO. AREAS AND- I COULD NOT BE. ACCOMPLISHED VIA THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FROM LAST YEAR- SO THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AND- GAVE GAVE. A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY IS THE DISCRETION TO- PUT PUT THEIR FUNDS TOWARD THEIR SUBJECT MATTER AREAS THAT THEY- THEY SAW FIT- SO THIS THIS IS MONEY THAT'S THAT'S SPECIFIC TO. MATH AND SCIENCE TO ENSURE THAT THAT FUNDING GETS TO THOSE SUBJECT MATTER AREAS SO WE DIDN'T THINK% THAT THEY WOULD PRIORITIZE. MATH AND SCIENCE ACCORDINGLY- ALL DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUE AMBER ALEXANDER. AMBER ALEXANDER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU ARE CORRECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT THAT AT THE CORE SUBJECT AREAS WERE ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS UNDER THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- TO MY COLLEAGUES POINT. THERE THERE WERE SEVERAL- FOCUS AREAS IN WHICH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COULD CHOOSE TO PURSUE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS INVESTMENT IS REALLY TARGETED AT TRYING TO- INCENTIVIZE AND ENCOURAGE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY IN MATH AND SCIENCE RECOGNIZING THAT THEY COULD THEY COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THOSE AREAS UNDER THE INITIAL% INVESTMENT. BUT RECOGNIZING ALSO THE COMPETING PRIORITIES AND WANTING TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING IN THE CORE SUBJECTS. OKAY AND I KNOW THAT THE COMMISSION HAS HAD A LOT OF IDEAS AND- WITH A LOT OF RESEARCH ON WHAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PEOPLE IN THE TEACHER. PROFESSION AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A MAJOR TEACHER SHORTAGES ATTACHMENT TO MANY- EMERGENCY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS IN CLASSROOM THAT YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY HARD PROBABLY A QUICK TO SERVE OUR ALL OF OUR KIDS. SO THERE'S A BIG LIST OF IDEAS WE FUNDED. WHAT IF THE LAST FEW YEARS AND SOME NEW ONES THIS YEAR SO ONE THAT HAD BEEN- ADDRESS OF THE YEARS I KNOW BY THE COMMISSION AS WELL. IS IT INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAM SO SENSE STATE. FOUR YEAR DEGREE ITSELF TO. FOR GO TO GETTING A JOB BY BORROWING MORE MONEY TO GO TO- COLLEGE FOR ONE MORE YEAR AND THEN GETTING A JOB THAT MAY NOT BE AS MUCH AS YOU WHAT I GOT WHEN YOU LEFT THE FOR YOU TO REACH FOR ANOTHER JOB. SO AND I SHOULD BE AN EFFORT. PRIORITIES TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS SAID. CURIOUS WHY THOSE TYPE OF- IDEAS. AREN'T HERE. I'M SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT INTEGRATED UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM- BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE IN MAY SECURES WHY INDIAN POP UP IN ME. I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE AMBER AT AMBER ALEXANDER AGAIN WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF THAT THAT CONVERSATION AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TAT CONCEPT AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATION. WITH YOU AND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY STAFF- RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS- A DESIRE TO HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE WE INVEST MORE THAN WHAT HIS PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMON GROUND AND THAT THERE IS AN INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA IN WHICH TO START THE CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS MISTER DONNA I JUST WANT TO JUMP ON YOUR LAST TOPIC THEY'RE THE INTEGRATED- PREPARATION PROGRAM I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE WE'VE GIVEN OUT GRANTS TO COLLEGES THE PLAN. AND SO APPARENTLY THEY MET AND PLANNED ANOTHER WORDS THIS OUT AS A PLANNING GRANT SO THEY HAD MEETINGS WHEN THEY PLANNED BUT NOTHING CHANGED I THINK WHAT WE'RE HAVING IS A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S SOME RESISTANCE AT THE AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL TO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A CHANGE WHEREIN ONE CAN GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND A TEACHING CREDENTIAL INSIDE THAT FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE SO THAT IS NEW TO SOME YOU UNIVERSITY SUMMER RESISTANT. BUT WE STE WE HAVE THE LAW PASSED FOR A REASON I WAS THE AUTHOR OF IT. AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE GIVE THESE AGAIN THESE PLAN GRANTS GO OUT OF THEIR THERE'S NOTHING AT THE END THAT WE TOUCH IS NO TANGIBLES IN OUTCOMES THE A THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PLANNING GRANTS THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTATION. GRANTS SO I HOPE WE CAN CHANGE THE WORDING THE FOCUS. SO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS NOT PLANNING GRANTS. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL MANY UNIVERSITIES GOT THE- GOT THE PLANNING GRANT. I MEAN IT'S NICE LUNCHES ETCETERA. BUT THEY PLAN I'M SURE THEY PLAN. BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT'S THE END PRODUCT THERE'S NO END PRODUCTS AGAIN. IMPLEMENTATION NOT PLANNING I THINK YOU GET IT THANK YOU. OKAY JOIN RESPOND- YES SO THE TEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IS FOR IMPLEMENTATION- BUT I WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND ARE NOTEDAND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING FURTHER IN BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. CAN I MISTER YES SO ONE SO THEY ARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION- GRANTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW SPECIFIC THE LANGUAGE IS. BUT IS THERE GOING TO BE SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT COMES OUT OF A- AT OF THAT GRANTS ARE THE IS THE UNIVERSITY GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM ARE THEY JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE DOES GIVE- THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THAT THE DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM I KNOW THEY- THEY ARE LISTENING I IMAGINE THAT THEY WILL BE TAKING THOSE COMMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION AS THEY CRAFT. THE PROGRAM ASSUMING THAT IT DOES- GET GET ADOPTED IN SOME FORM. SOMEONE NEEDS TO DROP A HAMMER HERE TO GET THESE PROGRAMS UP AND GOING- WE'RE CLEARLY MEETING RESISTANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S- NOT MAYBE THE WAY THEY'VE- ALWAYS DONE THINGS- THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS SINCE I THINK NINETEEN SIXTIES SO IT IS A BIG CHANGE. BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE NOT JUST TO FILL THE PIPELINE BUT IT'S- IT'S KIND OF A NO BRAINER. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER PREPARE TEACHER IF THEY SPEND FOUR YEARS. TRAINING TO BE A TEACHER AS OPPOSED TO HAVING. FOUR YEARS EARNING DEGREE AND THEN ONE YEAR AFTER THAT- EARNING A TEACHING CREDENTIAL SO I THINK THERE'S MANY REASONS. TO- TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. AND FULLY EMPLOY THE INTEGRATOR INTEGRATIVE PROGRAM INTO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS I THANK YOU. DAVID OUR RANCHO. THANK YOU WHAT ARE THE COMMENTS WAS MADE EARLIER WAS. SCHOOL COUNSELING IS NOT AN AREA WITH A CHRONIC SHORTAGE. AND IT WE FIND THAT IN FACT THERE IS A GREAT SHORTAGE AND THE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BILLS AND THE BUDGET PROPOSALS- ASKING FOR A FUNDING TO HELP THOSE WHO WANT TO GO INTO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS INCLUDING COUNSELING- I KNOWS OF SUCH REQUIRES. GENERALLY THIS IS INCLUDED TO- WE HAVE A PROPOSAL ALSO AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO AGAIN TO HELP. PROVIDE THE FUNDING TO HELP THOSE WHO CAN GO INTO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND THEN WORK IN THE SCHOOLS. BY REQUIRE. NONPROFITS BY US- SO JUST I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT THAT THAT I AM MAYBE- I'VE I'VE NOTED IT INCORRECTLY BUT THERE IS A GREAT SHORTAGE OF COUNSELORS FOR STUDENTS DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I EAT YES I CAN I CAN RESPOND TO THAT- SO MAX BY DEPARTMENT FINANCE- THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THE PANDEMIC I CREATED AN INCREDIBLE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BURDEN ON THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND AS AS PART OF A RECOGNITION OF THAT AND WE ARE INCLUDING IN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AUG DOLLAR AUGMENTATION- FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM TO INCLUDE SCHOOL COUNSELOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN THAT AUGMENTATION RECOGNIZING THAT- WE'VE SEEN SUCCESS WITH THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN- RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION- AND WE ALSO SEE HIGHER RATES OF RETENTION WITHOUT PROGRAM.

I'M HAVING A HOLD HARMLESS WITHIN THE DOES PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CHARTER AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS- BUT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING A MULTI YEAR PLAN TO TRANSITION FUNDING TO BEING BASED ON ENROLLMENT IN THE FUTURE I'M WITH A MULTI YEAR PLAN CHUKKER PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS CONNECT PETITIONS ARE TO HELP.

ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT SORT THE. AND ARE TWENTY. THE AP VAULTERS BY PETITIONS I'M WITH MY COME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. OKAY SO THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF ATTENTION THIS TOP OF COURSE SAID. CHILD CARE YEAH AFFORDABILITY ACCESS AND A BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE OUR RATES I KNOW SUMMER REYES HAD AND I AM WORKING ON THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND COURSE WE HAVE CONSTANT ATTENTION HERE INCLUDING A BIG RALLY- TODAY AND- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND D. DO YOU THINK AND THE PARCEL SERVICES DO YOU THINK THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE IS ADEQUATE. TO ENABLE THE FIELD TO DO THEIR JOB AND A FUNCTIONING CALIFORNIA. DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. I'M MAJOR TOMORROW WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE THAT WAS AGREED TO IN THE FIRST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE STATE AND CCP LAST YEAR AND THE MAYOR VISION ALSO REFLECTS THE FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTS TO THE RATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR THAT WERE AGREED TO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE TRUCTURE SUBJECT TO FUTURE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BUT WE ALL PURSUED AS CONSISTENT WITH THE AGREEMENT THE STATE AND C. C. P. YOU ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY THROUGH A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE ARCHDALE NC TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SINGLE REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE THAT ADDRESSES QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY WHILE SUPPORTING POSITIVE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. THE JONES HE WILL PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND STATES ALSO CONVENING A SEPARATE WORK GROUP TO ASSESS THE METHODOLOGY FOR ESTABLISHING A REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND EXISTING QUALITY STANDARDS FOR CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND NETWORK GROUP WILL PROVIDE STATION LATER THAN AUGUST FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. AT I GET ALL THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENT YOU READ ELOQUENTLY- BUT THE QUESTION IS. NOW THE GOVERNOR HAD A MASTER PLAN EARLY EDUCATION EVEN WORKING ON THIS AND WE SIGNED THE CONTRACT- LAST YEAR BUT DO WE THINK THE RATES ARE ADEQUATE. TO SUPPORT THE CHILD CARE NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA TODAY DO WE THINK THERE ADEQUATE GARY CENTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- TO SORT OF ELABORATE ON MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS I THINK THAT WE ARE IN RECOGNITION THAT- THAT THE- THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO AND THIS AND IN THIS ARENA REGARDING A REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED LAST YEAR WHERE WE HAVE IN PLACE AN INCREASE IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND ENDED IT IN ADDITION TEMPORARY SUPPLEMENTS TO THOSE RATES- BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE THROUGH THE JAIL AND SEE AND THE WORK GROUP. TO FURTHER LOOK INTO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM THANK YOU AND GETS BETTER ANSWER- BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT THERE'S THAT THE COUNTRY IS ONE AND I BELIEVE THAT OF THE CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS THAT THAT CONTRACT. DOESN'T IMPACT- THIS. COURSE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THIS COURSE YOU KNOW. PUBLIC CHILD CARE- PROVIDERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ALSO ARE BASED UPON THE SAME REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND- AND YOU KNOW. WE SEE EVIDENCE ALL THE TIME E SEE THE INFLATION GONE UP AS WE TALK ABOUT K. TWELVE TREMENDOUSLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND- IT DOESN'T PENCIL OUT THAT'S WHY DURING THE PANDEMIC WE SAW. JUST CLOSE NOT RICH IN MINIMUM WAGE HAS GONE UP AS WELL SO WE DON'T WANT TO PAY PEOPLE YOU KNOW LIVING WAGE IS NOT PARTY WAGES. AND SO WE'RE NOT- DONE WITH OUR GREAT REFORM AND RATE REIMBURSEMENT INCREASES AND SO. THAT'S A PRIORITY OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND JUST WANTED TO FOR THE RECORD HERE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS ABOUT THAT I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO MORE RESEARCH AND STUDY ON IT BUT I THINK ALL THE- SURVEYS THAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE. SHOW THAT IT'S INADEQUATE. I'M IF THE IF THE THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS WERE AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THEM- I THINK THAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND WE WOULD. LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING INTO YOU HAVE THAT THE EXISTING COMPLEXITIES AND HOW THINGS ARE WORKING WITH REIMBURSEMENT TO MAKE THOSE MORE SIMPLIFIED MAKE THEM WORK BETTER FOR THE FIELD. AND DO THAT THROUGH THE CITY ON C. AND WORK GROUP SO. IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT TO SEE THROUGH THIS WORK AND- THE- MOVE THROUGH THROUGH THE NEXT BY THE BUDGET CYCLE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO- AND ADDRESS IMPROVED REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE. THANK YOU SUMMER RACE. I'LL SHOW THIS. WEEKEND THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUE. IF WE'RE LUCKY THE FLOTATION RATES. HERE THAT WE'RE JUST PROVIDED TO US EARLIER WE ALSO HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD RATE STUDY. HAT GIVE US A BETTER IDEA. LOTS OF MONEY SPENT BUT THAT'S THE STUDY THAT SURVEYED TOGETHER. AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR. AND THEN ALSO THE STRESSES OF PANDEMIC AND WHAT THAT MEANS THAT THE MOST RECENT. CHILD CARE FACILITY THE CLOSES THE CAPITAL. CAPITAL CHILD CARE FACILITY. AND THEY'RE NOT BEING REPLACED AND WE HEAR THIS OFTEN. AND WE KNOW IT'S TRUE WE'RE NOT PAYING OUR WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERVE. THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN THE MOST PRECIOUS THING THAT WE HAVE. AND YET. WE PUT TOGETHER A STUDY THAT SAYS THE MORE WE'RE LOSING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING PAID ENOUGH THEY'RE SAYING PAY US MORE. AND YET WE COME TO THE END AND WE DON'T PAY THEM MORE- THE THEY ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THINGS OF HOW WE WANT- ORDERED. THE TO PROVIDE THE EDUCATION PROVIDE THE CARE FOR CHILDREN AND- I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIRED SOMETHING THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE STILL NEED TO LOOK AT THAT- AND I RECOGNIZE. THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU PREFER TO THE- FIRST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. WE GET IT. BUT IF WE KNOW THAT IT ISN'T ENOUGH THEN WE DO HAVE THAT OBLIGATION TO REVIEW IT FURTHER. I WANTED TO ASK IF I MAY- SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE FAMILY FEES WAIVER AND LYFT. SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR THANK YOU TO. TO THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD FOR THAT. IT IS A ONE YEAR EXTENSION. AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION. CAN YOU BREAK THAT DOWN FOR US PLEASE WHAT IS THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION- I'M SURE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AB JUST TO CLARIFY- THE TOTAL PROPOSED FUNDING TO EXTEND THE FAMILY FEE WAIVERS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION- THIS IS THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE- PROJECTED NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO WITHOUT THE WAIVER. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO- PAY A FAMILY FEE THAT WE WOULD WE WILL BE COVERING ON THEIR BEHALF. AND THE FEDERAL FUNDING OF THE FEDERALLY WE CAN EXTEND IT FURTHER. AND THE I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT WE CAN EXTEND IT. INTO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD LOOK AT SO THAT OUR CHILD CARE FACILITIES. CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK MY GOODNESS NEXT YEAR WE GOT TO GET STARTED WITH THIS AGAIN AND WE'RE HIGHER. LONGER KEEP THEM AND- IF. WE HAVE THE- TO EXTEND IT FURTHER. AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD- SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVING TO COME BACK. YEAR AFTER YEAR WHEN WE HAVE THAT ABILITY IN THE VERY LEAST FEDERALLY TO EXTENDED ANOTHER YEAR BEYOND THAT- I WOULD THE APPS THAT WE LOOK AT THAT VERY SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. SO BACK TO THIS- BACK TO THAT THIS THE STUDY THAT YOU MENTIONED- DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE IN STATUTE WHERE WE SAY WE SHOULD BE AT THIS EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND WERE BELOW THAT BY TEN POINTS OR SO SAYS AND THAT THE STUDY THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND THEY WERE NOT. FOLLOWING THAT TO FIND. OUR CENTER BASED AND FAMILY BASED CHILDCARE AND PRE K. PROGRAMS- YES OF WHAT WAS REFLECTED IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND ADOPTED INTO STATUTE WAS AT THE S. SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARMOR SURVEY I GET THAT BUT AGAIN OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COVERED. TO THE CONTRACT WHICH WE 100% SUPPORT I THINK THAT'S MAYBE L. L. CAN HELP US LIKE LESS THAN A QUARTER OF PEOPLE AT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF WHAT IS- UTILIZE WITH OUR REIMBURSEMENT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. A DIGNITARY REFERRING TO IS I THINK THERE'S INTENT LANGUAGE IN STATUTE THAT SAYS THAT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GET ULTIMATELY GET TO GET PROVIDERS TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED AFFECTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN CLOSE TO DOUBLE- AT THIS POINT WE'RE AT SEVENTY FIFTH OF THE RETAIL MARKET RATE LAST YEAR THERE WERE THERE WAS PROGRESS IN THAT- THE COUNTRY PROVIDERS THAT WERE UNDERSTAND REIMBURSEMENT RATES HAVE NOW MOVED ON TO THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND MANY OF THEM WERE VERY FAR BELOW THAT THE- REASON ORDER HAVE MOVED UP BUT STILL. THE SEVENTY FIFTH ALONG WITH THE- MODIFIES THE EIGHTY FIFTH OF THE OF THE RELIGIOUS REMIND US TO OVERALL THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE PAID FOR STATE PRESCHOOL. CHILD CARE. THERE'S FUNDED AND FAMILY TO CARE HOME. CORRECT BACK AND SO. THIS THAT THE CENTERS THAT ARE HERE AROUND TOWN MAYBE EVEN HE ONE HERE DOWNTOWN THAT. FAMILIES THAT USE SUBSIDIZED CARE. THEY'RE NOT PART OF A CONTRACT RIGHT. SO THAT WE KEEP FOCUSING ON THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE. IMPACTED BY THIS CONTRACT BUT REMIND US AGAIN HOW MUCH OF THE OVERALL. PIES THAT ALTHOUGH I THINK IF THE I AM. NOT SURE I THINK THE GENERAL IN TERMS OF OVERALL AMOUNT I BELIEVE THAT JOHN TUCKER IN THE- IF YOU PROGRAMS MAY BE. FROM A SIMILAR BUT MOST OF OUR GREAT MOST OF THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU INCLUDED EIGHTY PROGRAM THREE MOST ARE SUBSIDIZED DR SYSTEM IS VOUCHER IS. SO FAMILIES OF THE ROGERS. THE PRIVATE- SO THESE ARE THE PROVIDER IS A FAMILY SHOW. THE BECAUSE I'M A VOUCHER THEY GET THEIR THEIR- THE COVERED- THOSE ARE ALSO THE FUNDED BASED ON REGIONAL MORE RATE IN THE THIRTY FIFTH. OF THE- MARK. TO VERY THERE IS THERE- BIGGER WE ARE USING. WE'RE USING THE SEVENTY FIFTH AND IF OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SURVEYS SO WE ARE ALSO SEVERAL YEARS BEHIND TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. YES THEY WERE USING A FOUR YEAR OLD SURVEY WHICH WE KNOW IS INADEQUATE AND WE'RE- WELL BELOW THAT. SO WHAT'S THE NEED TO GO AND STUDY AGAIN WE'RE NO WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NICK WE KNOW WE'RE NOWHERE CLOSE TO. ADEQUATELY FUNDING WHERE WE SHOULD BE I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION BY. NAME MY- YARD. RICK. THREE THREE THAT I THINK WILL THE LADY BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC BUT- SHE- BE OUR- COMING IN FROM POINT. TO SO ARGUMENTS TO AS A SET TO AND THANK YOU TAKING THE NEW POSITION CALIFORNIA. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE THAT OF THE FIA FIELD WITH WE READ REPORTS ALL THE TIME WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PUBLIC COMMENT A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT HOW THIS. CRUMBLING AND FRAGILE SYSTEM OUT THERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER REYES SAID WE SEE IT NO FURTHER THAN ACROSS THE STREET OUR OWN CENTER HERE JOT DOWN. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BASED UPON THIS CURRENT BUDGET THERE ISN'T A PENNY AND IN ADDITION TO INCREASE RATES AND SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FURTHER STABILIZE OUR OUR CHILD SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- AND I CAN LOOK BEHIND ME MY LOVE- DEBBIE DIRECTOR- AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR I COULD TELL YOU THAT ALREADY THE- FEDERAL EVEN PRIOR. AND DEMOCRATS SO PRIOR TO THAT PANDEMIC WE ALSO HAVE WITH THE SYSTEM ITSELF WAS QUITE FRAGILE WITH THE PANDEMIC OBVIOUSLY IT IS STARTING TO REALLY BECOME EVEN MORE FRAGILE AND WE HEAR THAT WE HEAR FROM THE STAKE HOLDERS WE HAVE MEETINGS WITH WITH THEM FREQUENTLY AND HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT WE CAN SAY IS THAT THE MULTI YEAR INVEST. FOR ONE TWENTY TWO THAT CLOSELY BEEN THROUGH TWENTY THREE THAT MANY OF YOU WERE CHAMPIONS AT THAT IS A FIRST START FOR THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK THAT THE PERMANENT FINANCE CALLED THAT OUT ALSO BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS A BIG LEAP WITH THAT NOW THE RATE REFORM GROUP THAT WE ARE HAPPY AND THAT IS PART OF A WORK GROUP THAT'S MADE UP OF NOT ONLY WORKGROUP MEMBERS THAT ARE STILL. OUT AND THE PEOPLE THAT. BUT JUST HOW- AND OTHER. I ARE REALLY MAKE. A DIFFERENCE IN REGARDS TO BOISE IN WHAT IS THIS NEW SYSTEM- WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THE GROUP IS THAT THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE WHICH WAS WHAT. AND THERE WAS FOR IT REFERENCING IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WE'RE LOOKING THAT UP NOW TURNED IT UP METHODOLOGY. THAT'LL TURN A METHODOLOGY LOOKED TRUE COST OF CARE. I THINK THAT IN ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PLANNING TOGETHER ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STEPS- AND THEN WE TO CAN GET STIPENDS WE HAD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN STATEMENTS THAT WERE. SUPPLEMENTAL IT'S TO OUR- YEAH I'M WORKFORCE SO YES WE HAVE READ FOR. WE HAVE. INCREASE AN- BUT WE- HAD SUPPLEMENTAL TOO SO. THAT AND THAT WENT TO THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM SO NOT ONLY DID IT GO TO OUR STEPS AND. AND EVEN IF SYMPATHY FOR THE STATE BUT IT ALSO IN. A REVISED THIS. MAYBE SERVING A 100% UNTIL. SO IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST PROVIDE ONE STEP TO SUPPORT THE FIELD DURING THESE I'M PRESIDENT TIMES YEAH. SO THE FAMILY FEES ARE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN. THE SUMMER RACES BEEN CHAMPING THIS AND WE'VE BEEN SUPPORT OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO. WAIVE THEM AND GET RID OF THAT CAN BE IS JUST GET THEM. IT THAT PERFECTLY STYLE TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS. BUT THE A PIECE OF THE PIE. EVEN IF THEY ARE. IF THEY'RE WAY DOWN THERE YOU KNOW SOMEHOW AFFORDABLE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND A SPOT. AND BARS I HEAR A DOWNTURN ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO WHAT ARE THE SHUTTERED LOCATIONS TELLING YOU. OUR DEPARTMENT OR CALIFORNIA WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHAT THEY TELL US ALL THE TIME IS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY WOULD YOU OPEN A BUSINESS WHETHER IT'S A SANDWICH SHOP A DRY CLEANER ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOUR- REVENUE COMING IN DOESN'T EQUAL THE COSTS. YEAH KEEP IT TO OPERATE AND MAKE IT ALL GOES BACK TO THIS. RATE STRUCTURE SO. I ARE I AM AM I MISSING SOMETHING. I THINK I WOULD CREE EMPHASIZE AGAIN WHAT WE CURRENTLY ARE- IMPLEMENTING THIS CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS WHAT WE PROPOSE LIKE YOU'VE MENTIONED- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS AN EXTENSION WHICH YES I BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILY FEES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO WAVE OFF OF TO WAIT BUT WE ALSO HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS. HOLD HARMLESS SPECIFICALLY MEANS THAT THESE SITES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE YOUR- AND REIMBURSEMENT- AND SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH BASED ON ATTENDANCE BUT BASED ON- BUT BASED ON ENROLLMENT THAT SIGNIFICANTLY HELP STABILIZES THE FIELD TOO SO THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE THAT IS PART OF THIS BUDGET THAT HAS BEEN EXTENDED FOR ONE MORE YEAR. BUT AGAIN WE'RE WORKS CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME WORK AHEAD OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET OUR LONG TERM GOALS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE MASTER PLAN. OF EARLY LEARNING. SO AGAIN WHO WHAT ARE THE CENTER IS TELLING YOU. THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO YOU THE SAME THING THEY TELL US THE RATES SO THE CENTERS ARE TELLING US QUITE A FEW THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CENTERS WITH THE HOLD HARMLESS RIGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE TITLE FIVE CENTERS WERE CALLING I THINK WE HEARD IT IN THE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND WE ALSO HEARD IN THE LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS AND WE ALL RECEIVED. LETTERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND THIS MAY PROPOSAL- ADDRESS THAT AND THAT TOO WE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR RATE REFORM WORK GROUP IN REGARDS TO THE LOOKING AT THE RATE STRUCTURE AND THE RATE REFORM WORK GROUP HAS. COME IN FOR THEIR COMEDY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OTHER ALTERNATE METHODOLOGY AND BE ABLE TO LOOK AT TO COST OF CARE SO WE'RE ALSO HEARING ABOUT THAT ALSO SO THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ASK FOR HEARING WERE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO BE ABLE. TO THINK ABOUT THIS LONG TERM SYSTEM. OKAY ACTIMIZE RACE. JUST PUTTING THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE WHEN THE STUDY WAS DONE FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE MINIMUM WAGE IN CALIFORNIA WAS ELEVEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. TWENTY TWENTY TWO MINIMUM WAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT'S A 27% INCREASE JUST IN THE COST OF WORKERS' SALARIES. AB WE ARE CURRENTLY FUNDING IT AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IF THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES ANOTHER INCREASE TO FIFTEEN FIFTY PER HOUR WHICH BRINGS THE INCREASE TO THIRTY PERCENT. TOTAL. THE MAY REVISE GIVES NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS TO PAY THE WORKERS AT THE CURRENT LEVEL. IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL HEARING THIS IS THAT OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS AND- WE HAVE TO AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS QUESTIONS. AND I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASK ANSWER THEM YOU KNOW SIMPLY HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT I THINK AS WE WORK TO FINALIZE THE BUDGET IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT HAS TO BE A- IN. THE AREA IS. OUR HEAD START- THERE WAS A BUDGET REQUEST SPECIFIC BUDGET REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS- IT IDENTICAL THE FUNDING- TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR HEAD START TEACHERS. SALARIES FOR HEAD START TEACHERS. ARE DEEPLY EQUITABLE WHEN YOU COMPARE THE T. TWO K. TWELVE- TO COMPARE TO THE TO K. TWELVE COLLEAGUES FOR A TYPICAL HEAD START TEACHER WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE THEY'RE MAKING ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND A YEAR. WHERE AS- THE SALARY FOR A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER. IS SIXTY SIX THOUSAND A YEAR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE WE'RE WE'RE LOSING OUR TEACHERS. AND IT IS A PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT WE- SOMEHOW NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF AS THEY SAY OUR LITTLES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SOMEONE EVER I KNOW THEY'RE NOT HERE BUT WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON WEBEX CAN WE CAN WE BRING THEM UP. VIDEO VIDEO. AND OF COURSE THERE. WILL BE A THIRD AYE SUREWHO IT IS WITH CD BUT IT ONCE YOU START TALKING WE CAN SEE YOU YOU HEAR ME YES THERE YOU ARE. HI VIRGINIA EARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION VIRGINIA GOOD TO SEE YOU SO MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US SOLVE THIS RIDDLE BECAUSE BUT THE SUMMER RACETHERE WERE GETTING AT IS WE 100% VALUE THE CCP YOU CONTRACTED GIVE YOU KNOW THAT ENTITY IN THAT WORK FORCE- DIGNITY IN. LIVING WAGES AND BENEFITS AND SO FORTH AND BE ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY ORGANIZED BUT WE KEEP GOING BACK TO SOMETIMES ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE DEPARTMENT SO YOU KNOW WE CAN'T WORK ON ALL THESE OTHER RATES BECAUSE THE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON THIS PIECE SO HOW MUCH OF THE OVERALL PIE IS C. C. P. U. S. ALL OTHERS THAT ARE IMPACTED. BY THE RATES AND POTENTIAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS. YEAH I THINK IT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO TO CLARIFY- THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS. FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND LICENSE EXEMPT SO OF THOSE THREE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME PROVIDERS AND LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS ARE THAT RECEIVE SEVENTY SIX. ARE REPRESENTED BY. BY THE UNION- AT THE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS ARE NOT. BASED ON DATA FROM OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS IS PRE TRANSITION OF CHILD CARE TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- SO THIS INCLUDES. ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT STATE PRESCHOOL CAL WORK STAGES TWO AND THREE. FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME NETWORKS GENERAL CHILDCARE ARE MIGRANT PROGRAMS ND THAT CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES PROGRAMS. OF THOSE ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS 55% OF SEARCH OF CHILDREN THAT WERE ENROLLED IN CTE PROGRAMS IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. WERE I'M IN CENTER BASED PROGRAMS SO OVER HALF OF CHILDREN AND ROLLED OUT WERE RECEIVING CARE AND A CENTER PROGRAM. WHEREAS 31% OR IN FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND ABOUT 15% WERE IN LICENSE EXEMPT NOW THEY EXACT PERCENTAGES VARY BY PROGRAM AND SO I WOULD DEFER TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON MORE CURRENT ESTIMATES FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. I WILL SAY THT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE MAJORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS OPERATED AND CENTERS. WELL I'M NOT SURE I KIND OF GOT THE MATH BUT IN PLAIN ENGLISH IT SEEMS THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE NOT PART OF THE C. C.
