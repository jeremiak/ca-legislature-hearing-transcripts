THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO ONE AND SIX POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IN APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF THAT IS FEDERAL FUNDING. CDA CONTRACTS WITH THE NETWORK OF THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING KNOWN AS TRIPLE A.'S. THAT DIRECTLY MANAGE A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT FOR OLDER AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY. TO PROMOTE HEALTHY AGING AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT HELP OLDER ADULTS FIND EMPLOYMENT AND ASSIST FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND THEIR VITAL KERR GIVING ROLE. IN ADDITION CITY CONTRACTS WITH THIRTY EIGHT LOCAL AGENCIES THAT OPERATE THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM. THROUGH THE MEDI CAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED WAIVER FOR THE ELDERLY AND CDA ALSO CERTIFIES COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROVIDERS. FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

AND THE MANY OTHER LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN ADMINISTERING THESE PROGRAMS WITH US. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HOLD OUR QUESTION KIDS. UNTIL AFTER ALL THE PANELS IT'S OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK -- YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JOE RODRIGUEZ THE CALIFORNIA STATE. LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAD. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH GOAL FOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PLAN ON AGING. WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER RIGHTS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND ASSIST THEM TO OBTAIN NEEDED BENEFITS. IN THEIR EVALUATION OF THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. RECOMMENDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT ON BUT IT'S BEEN REPRESENTATIVE FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE BEDS. THESE POSITIONS WERE ENVISIONED TO BE. STAFF OMBUDSMAN GOING INTO FACILITIES WORKING ON COMPLAINTS WITH RESIDENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOR NURSING HOMES AND SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN ASSISTED LIVING AND BOARDING CARE HOMES. FOR A COMBINED TOTAL OF A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE BEDS. USING THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S RECOMMENDED RATIO AS DO OTHER STATES. CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS. SOME OF THESE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS ARE ALSO PROGRAM COORDINATORS AND MANAGERS SIT MINISTER THE PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT IN FACILITIES WORKING WITH RESIDENTS DIRECTLY. LIMITED OLDER AMERICANS ACT FUNDING. DOES NOT ALLOW LOCAL PROGRAMS TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF. CALIFORNIA UNLIKE MOST OTHER STATES ALSO GIVES THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO PERFORM. LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN RIVERS REPRESENTATIVES RECEIVED REPORTS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT FOR MANDATED REPORTERS AND OTHERS. IN MOST OTHER STATES OTHER ENTITIES LIKE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES OR THE LICENSING AGENCY RECEIVE THOSE REPORTS. TWENTY THREE POINT 4% OF ALL COMPLAINTS MADE TO THE PROGRAM. OUR ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION. MANY OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE ALSO FROM FACILITIES STAFF. IN THE FIFTH IN THE FACILITIES WHERE THE LONG TERM CARE. PROGRAM DOES NOT PERFORM TRADITIONAL OLDER AMERICANS ACT ADVOCACY. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIGATE TO THOSE REPORTS? THEY ALSO ADDED OTHER FACILITIES BEYOND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING BORN KERR WE ALSO WE SEE REPORTS FROM. PEOPLE IN ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE C. BASS SITES. ADULT A PROGRAMS. INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. THIS DECREASES THE TIME AVAILABLE FROM BUTTON PROGRAMS TO MAKE WRECKED REGULAR VISITS TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING ABOARD CARE HOMES. IN ADDITION IN CALIFORNIA ON WAS BEEN REPRESENTATIVES MUST WITNESS ADVANCE HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVES FOR RESIDENTS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. LAST YEAR ON BUDGET REPRESENTATIVES WITNESSED OR TENDED TO WITNESS CLOSE TO TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED ADVANCED DIRECTIVES FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. THESE THESE DIRECTIVES OFTEN TIMES REQUIRE SEVERAL VISITS FROM AN OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTATIVE. THIS RESPONSIBILITY ALSO IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO MAKE REGULAR NON COMPLAINT RELATED VISITS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU'VE GIVEN US MUCH OF WHAT -- WOULD BE DISCUSSED UNDER ISSUE THREE IN GREATER DETAIL I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THAT WHEN WE GET TO ISSUE THREE THERE WILL BE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. TO HANG AROUND THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- NEXT ON THE LIST WAS AT LONG. YES THANK YOU -- I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A MOMENT IT'S A GIVEN THAT I KNOW THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT NEED IDENTIFICATION AT CETERA COMING LATER ON THE AGENDA TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT IN WHICH NEEDS DETERMINATION AND PLANNING TAKE PLACE. OF FOR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND THE STATE. SO ALL TRYING NOT TO GO ON TOO LONG -- AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW PLANT [inaudible] OF AS MS MORTAR AND YOUR AGENDA HAVE DESCRIBED CDA ADMINISTERS MOST OF ITS PROGRAMS FOR SUBVENTION CONTRACTS WITH THE NETWORK OF THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEED IDENTIFICATION PLANNING SERVICES TERM DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY IN THIRTY THREE PLANNING AND SERVICE AREAS. ACROSS THE STATE. TRIPOLI'S OCCUPY A RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONAL SETTINGS -- COUNTY CITY JOINT POWERS AGREEMENTS PRIVATE NON PROFITS AND WE HAVE ONE THAT SITUATED IN THE UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION. OF PLANNING AND SERVICE AREAS VARY IN SIZE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS GEOGRAPHY TYPOGRAPHY RANGE AND VOLUME OF A RATE AVAILABLE SERVICES AND IT'S CONSEQUENTLY THE APPROACH TO NEEDS IDENTIFICATION SERVICE DELIVERY MUST BE SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE. TO A NEIGHBOR ENABLE EACH TRIPLE A TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES. CDA AND AREA AGENCIES ON AGING OTHERWISE KNOWN AS TRIPLE A IS. OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR BUDGETARY AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE POTENTIAL PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS FOCUSED ON NEEDS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY. NONE THE LESS ASIDE FROM FUNDING SERVICES DIRECTLY BOTH RELY ON COLLABORATION COORDINATION AND THE RELATED ABILITY TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES TO ADVANCE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS NEED. THE APPROACH TO NEED AND SERVICE DELIVERY EMPLOYED BY TRIPLE A IS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT -- ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY MARKHAM YOU TO FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TALKED ABOUT IS AN APPROACH WHERE YOU'RE WORKING WITH PEOPLE. AND TRYING TO DEVELOP AN PLAN SERVICES RATHER DOWN -- TRYING TO PLAN AND DEVELOP SERVICES FOR PEOPLE. OF THE FOCUS IS ON ENGAGEMENT. TRIPLE A.'S IDENTIFIED NEED IN PLAN SERVICE DELIVERY. OF IN A MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OPENING PRINCIPLES STATED IN THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT WHICH SPEAK TO THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS AND THE PLANNING AND OPERATION OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. AND PROGRAMS PROVIDED FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND PROTECTION AGAINST ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION. THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT REQUIRES EACH AREA AGENCY TO DEVELOP AN AREA PLAN FOR PROVIDING SERVICES. THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED SYSTEM. IN DEVELOPING AND ADMINISTERING THE AREA PLAN. TRIPLE A.'S MUST CONSIDER THE VIEWS OF SERVICE RECIPIENTS AND ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COUNCIL. CONSISTING OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS AND OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE SERVICE PROVIDERS LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICIALS AT CETERA TO ADVISE THE TRIPLE ON A ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO AREA PLAN DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND RELATED OPERATIONS. UNDER THE PLAN DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF NEED FOR SERVICES IN EACH TRIPLE A.'S RESPECTIVE PLANNING AND SERVICE AREA AND PROVIDING TO MEET SUCH NEED IS A CORPORATE SPONSOR ABILITY. FURTHER IN PLANNING SERVICE DELIVERY TRIPLE IT'S REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON THOSE WITH HIGH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL NEED THE TICKER EARLY LOW INCOME MINORITY INDIVIDUALS. FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO AREA AGENCIES ABOUT EMPLOYING A CONVERGENT APPROACH TO DETERMINING NEED. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE DATA AND INFORMATION USED MAY BE BOTH OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE AND DERIVE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES THE CENSUS AND OTHER NATIONAL AND STATE DATA SETS. COMMUNITY CLIENTS IN PROVIDER SURVEYS FOCUS GROUPS PUBLIC HEARINGS AND SERVICE METRICS OF FOR EXAMPLE SERVICE -- INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE DATA ABOUT SUCCESSFUL CONNECTIONS TO SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. TRIPLE A.'S ALSO IDENTIFY THE SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT ALREADY EXISTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND RELATED RESOURCES. GAPS AND BARRIERS THE PREMISE OF THIS APPROACH IS TO CONSIDER MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF MEASURE OR DATA SOURCE WHEN MAKING PLANNING DECISIONS. CDA COMMUNICATES WITH TRIPLE A IS ABOUT UNMET NEEDS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS REVIEW OF AREA AGENCIES AREA PLANS AND THE UPDATES TO THOSE PLANS. EACH AREA PLAN INCLUDES DISCUSSION OF THE TRIPLE A.'S NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND FINDINGS AND DESCRIBES HOW INFORMATION FROM THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AFFECTS THE TRIPLE A.'S PRIORITIES. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OTHER EXAMPLES OF CDA ITS MECHANISMS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH REPLACE ABOUT NEED INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS THAT OCCUR IN THE REGULAR COURSE OF BUSINESS. DURING PERIODIC MEETINGS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND DURING ONSITE MONITORING VISITS WORD DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PLAN ON AGING. THOUGH FOR YOUR AREA PLANTS ARE SUBMITTED TO CDA FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR BEFORE WE SUBMIT OUR FOUR YEAR PLAN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE DEVELOP OUR STATE PLAN PURSUANT TO GUIDANCE RECEIVED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING WHICH MOST RECENTLY REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON OLDER AMERICANS ACT CORE PROGRAMS. OF DISCRETIONARY GRANTS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH COMMUNITY LIVING FOR COMMUNITY LIVING. OF ELDER JUSTICE AND PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. THE VISION MISSION GOAL AND GOALS AND STRATEGIES ARTICULATED IN OUR CURRENT STATE PLAN ON AGING ALIGNED WITH THESE FOCUS AREAS. AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE PUT OUR COOPERATION AND COORDINATION WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILY CARE GIVERS. AND CDS DESIRE TO SUPPORT TRIPLE A.'S AND OTHER KEY PARTNERS IN ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS ALSO -- SHAPES WHAT WE PUT IN OUR STATE PLAN. WHEN DEVELOPING OUR PLAN WE ALSO TAKE A CONVERGENT APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING NEED WE REVIEW THE NEEDS INFORMATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES? IN THE THIRTY THREE AREA PLANTS WE RECEIVE TO IDENTIFY WHAT LOCAL PRIORITIES ARE. OF WE ALSO REVIEW DATA AND STUDIES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE THE CENSUS AND SENSE OF PROJECTIONS THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY AT CETERA -- AND WE ALSO SOLICIT INPUT FROM AREA AGENCIES ON AGING THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING WHICH WHICH HOSTS OUR STATE PLAN HEARINGS. AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS WHO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON THE DRAFT STATE PLAN. CDA ALSO CONDUCTS FACE TO FACE HEARINGS ON OUR STATE PLAN AND POSTS IT FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. ALL INFORMATION GATHERED IN THIS WAY IS CONSIDERED WHEN IDENTIFYING NEED. AND HELPS TO SHAPE THE FINAL STATE PLANS GOALS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MARTHA. GET YEAH OKAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AT LEAST PUSH WROTE APARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING THAT HAPPINESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THE U. L. L.. ALRIGHT WE HAVE CLAY CAMP THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. GO AHEAD. HI THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE AND I THINK MY ROLE IS TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS FROM -- TRIPLE A PERSPECTIVE. SO ED DID A NICE JOB -- AS HAS THE REST OF THE APARTMENT OF AB DESCRIBING THE SITUATION IN THE PROCESS OF THE PROCESS SOUNDS A LITTLE CONVOLUTED BUT ACTUALLY WORKS REALLY WELL. BECAUSE IT'S TAKING INPUT FOR THE STATE PLAN FROM ALL AREAS IN ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT HOW THE SERVICES WORK. IS FEDERAL GUIDELINES WITH LOCAL CONTROL THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO EFFECTIVE BECAUSE PROVIDING SERVICES. IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AND RULE SAN BENITO COUNTY CELL OF THE ACT ALLOWS FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THAT LOCAL EXPERTISE TO MAKE SURE. THE SERVICES ARE USED AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. I'M A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT ME. AND AND HOW WE DOCUMENT THAT. I'M JUST THE SHEER GROWTH OF THE POPULATION IS IMPACTING TRIPLE A.'S EXTREMELY HARD AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH A POPULATION THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS AGING AND TO WELL. THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS SO MUCH EASIER BUT CALIFORNIA HAS THE GREATEST PERCENTAGE OF SENIORS IN GREATEST NUMBER OF SENIORS LIVING IN POVERTY. ARM ONE IN SIX ARE ALSO LIVING ALONE AND LIVING ALONE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON HEALTH AND IT'S A GREAT HEALTH PREDICTOR -- IT'S BEEN COMPARED THAT TO LIVING ALONE IN BEING ISOLATED IS EQUIVALENT TO A SMOKING HALF A PACK OF CIGARETTES A DAY IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND IMPACTS SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT. IN COMING YEARS IT'S KIND OF A CUTTING EDGE -- FACTOR RIGHT NOW THAT PEOPLE JUST STARTING TO LOOK AT ONE IN FIVE OR MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE SO WE REALLY HAVE THE NUMBERS AND I THINK THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE NEED. THE CHALLENGES WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT AND WITH THE POPULATION HAVING GROWN BY 40% IN THE PAST DECADE THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES SOME REALLY GOOD NUMBERS ABOUT THAT. I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS. JUST MATCH REALLY THINKING YOU WOULD EXPECT THE DOLLARS TO AT LEAST GROW IN A SIMILAR MANNER IF THE NEED IS STILL THERE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE THOSE PEOPLE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE STATE WHEN OUR COUNTRY WAS IN AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AGING PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY OLDER AMERICANS ACT RELATED PROGRAMS OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACT PROGRAMS. GOT CUT INTO HOLE BY ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS WE WENT FROM I THINK SIXTY FIVE BILLION I MIGHT BE OFF BY MILLION OR TWO ON HERE. TO THE SIX FROM SIXTY TWO MILLION TO THIRTY THREE MILLION. SO THAT JUST DEVASTATED THE TRIPLE A NETWORK AND OUR ABILITY TO MEET. NEW SERVICES OR NEW DEMAND ON SERVICE MADE US EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE I MEAN I WOULD ARGUE WE ALWAYS HAD BEEN BUT WHEN THAT HAPPENED YOU SAW PROGRAM INTEGRATION BEYOND BELIEF BUT YOU ALSO SAW PROGRAM DETERIORATION. IN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS HOW DO WE KEEP MEETING MEAL NUMBERS MEAL DEMANDING AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN A IN ANOTHER PANEL. BUT WHEN RESOURCES ARE SHRINKING LIKE THAT. DRASTIC STEPS ARE OFTEN TAKEN TO MAKE SURE SOME YOU'LL STILL GET OUT THERE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT INSTEAD OF DELIVERING A DAILY MEAL DELIVER MEALS ONCE A WEEK. AND THAT TIES INTO ANOTHER THING JUST THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THESE PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP REALLY USE VOLUNTEERS. AND THEY'RE NOT JUST VOLUNTEERS THAT LICK ENVELOPES OMBUDSMAN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF VOLUNTEERS IN THE THE HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL. THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM HEALTH INSURANCE COUNTS AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT RELIES ON VOLUNTEERS TO EXPLAIN MEDICARE FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM FOR SOMEBODY OFF THE STREET WHO'S NOT COMPENSATED TO TRY TO DO. TAX ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS AGAIN THESE ARE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS NOW IMAGINE IF. H. AND R. BLOCK OR REQUIRED TO USE VOLUNTEERS TO DO THEIR TAXES OR IF. SCHOOLS WERE REQUIRED TO USE VOLUNTEERS TO TEACH CLASSES OR YOU KNOW IF BANKERS HAVE THEY HAVE 75% OF THEIR STAFF BE VOLUNTEERS WE WE WOULD JUST. NEVER CONSIDER THAT REALISTIC OR ACCEPTABLE BUT THAT'S THE WAY THE AGING COMMUNITY AN AGING PROGRAMS ARE SET UP BUT YOU HAVE TO USE PRIMARILY VOLUNTEERS FOR A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO. THAT'S A CONCERN THAT THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT I KNOW I'M GOING ON FOR A WHILE SO I'LL TRY TO WRAP UP HERE -- I THINK THERE'S THERE'S TWO KEY FACTORS GOING FORWARD THAT WE SHOULD ALL THINK ABOUT. AND ONE IS YOU KNOW DO WE DO SOMETHING PROGRESSIVE OR CREATIVE AROUND THIS FOR WEEKS DO WE JUST TRY TO AVOID IT. AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WE CAN DO EITHER SO FAR MOST OF THE ACTION HAS BEEN TO HOPE FOR THE BEST WITH NO. AGGRESSIVE OR PROGRESSIVE ACTION BEING TAKEN TO DEAL WITH THIS HUGE INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. SO IF WE DO THAT WHAT HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE INSTITUTIONALIZED WHICH IS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST INTERVENTION POSSIBLE FOR THE ONLY ONE THAT'S HIGHER IS MORE PEOPLE BEING INJURED OR HAVING STROKES ARE CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES. THAT DAN AND UP IN HOSPITALS SO THAT'S THE DO NOTHING ROUTINE WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW WE COULD DO THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY THROUGH THE NOSE FOR TO HAPPEN IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE OBVIOUSLY GOES DOWN. FOR WE CAN LOOK AT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT TRY TO AVERT OUR PREVENT OR DELAY THOSE THINGS FROM HAPPENING. AND IF WE INVEST A LITTLE MONEY IN THAT WE CAN LOWER THE OVERALL COSTS AND INCREASE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT EVERYBODY RECEIVES IT'S A CHOICE THAT WE ALL HALF. YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING WHERE BASICALLY CHOOSING LET'S HAVE THE HIGHEST INTERVENTIONS OUT THERE POSSIBLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CREATE BRAND NEW PROGRAMS THE PROGRAMS THAT ED AND FRAN AND JOE TALKED ABOUT WORK THEY WORK CHEAPLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND ALL WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE TO WORK SO IT'S NOT ARE YOU KNOW ANYTHING NEW INNOVATIVE IS IS OBVIOUSLY WELCOME AND GREAT. BUT THE BASS LINE IN COURT IS ALREADY THERE SO WE CAN HAVE SUCCESS BOTH FINANCIALLY IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE OF JUST EMBRACING. THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE IT'S POSSIBLE. SO UNLESS THERE'S QUESTIONS. THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME WHY. I THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND NOT GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND THAT'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE. IN A FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT. ALL THE RADIO THAT A INDIA. ISSUE ONE LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVED TO ISSUE [inaudible] TO THIS. YEAH BELIEVE WE HAVE THE SAME PANEL SO. FRAN IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND LEAD OFTEN WILL. MISTER LAW. CENTER. OKAY. IN IN WILL JUST CONTINUE DOWN THE SAME. HALF PATH SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CALL EVERYONE A VIEW OF EACH TIME THANK YOU. SO OF THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A WORKLOAD PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THE SEA BASS PROGRAM. IN ITS RESPONSIBILITIES THEY'RE REQUESTING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FROM FEDERAL FUNDS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND GENERAL FUND. AND THREE ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYSTS AND ONE NURSE EVALUATOR. THIS IS -- WORKLOAD PC PS I SAID TO ENSURE THE SEA BASS PROVIDER RECERTIFICATION IS OCCURRING WITHIN THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TIME FRAME. PROVIDERS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE NEW FEDERAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS RULE. AND PREPARE UP AND PROVIDERS SCREENING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT NEW PROVIDER APPLICATIONS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WITH REGARD TO THAT LAST -- STATEMENT AS OF THIS MONTH THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE C. BASS PROVIDERS AND OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND SEA BASS PARTICIPANTS. THE NUMBERS OF CENTERS AND PARTICIPANTS -- NUMBERS OF CENTERS AND PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO GROW STEP AWAY. AS OF JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN SO WE HAD RESPONDED TO THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM. INTERESTED PARTIES ABOUT OPENING A NEW CIVIC CENTER. ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO OF THOSE ENTITIES HAD SUBMITTED THE REQUIRED PROGRAM PLANS. AND FORTY TWO HAD SUBMITTED THEIR FORMAL SEE THUS APPLICATION AND ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES IN THE APPLICATION APPROVAL PROCESS SO THIS IS A PROCESS THEY NEED TO GO. THROUGH BEFORE WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THE PROCESS OF THEM BECOMING A PROVIDE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD AB INTERNET QUESTIONS MAY HAVE. LA -- CHECK YOUR PROCEDURAL NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] SO [inaudible] SHOULD. NOT RIGHT RIGHT THERE SHE JUST TURNED ON FOR YOU SIR. THERE WE GO. JERRY PASSED MORE WITH THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. ON ICE A STRONG SUPPORT OUR ORGANIZATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE WORK OF SEA BASS. IT IS HAS BEEN OF SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERFUNDED FOR OVER A DECADE. ALL AND IS GROWING IN RESPONSE TO THE POPULATION GROWTH IT'S OCCURRING AMONG SENIORS. BOB AND WE FEEL THAT THE THE BUDGET REQUEST TO HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF. TO REVIEW THE PROCESS OF OF AT NEW APPLICANTS AND ALLOWED TO REVIEW THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ONGOING IN THE SEA BASS. IS A CENTRAL IF THE SEA BASS PROGRAM IS TO SURVIVE AND CONTINUE SERVING. CALIFORNIA SO WE STRONGLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS REQUEST THANKS. HI I'M I AM NOT SURE THAT IT MATTERS WHERE I MAKE MY STATEMENTS ALL JUST MAKE IT NOW -- PLEASE SOME A LITTLE FROM REBUILDING TOGETHER OAKLAND EAST BAY. AND NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS NEED IN THE SHRINKING RESOURCES FOR FUNDS IN THE SENIOR AREA -- WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST GET SMARTER ABOUT HOW WE USE WHAT WE HAVE? AND SPECIFICALLY AND CONSIDERING THOUGHT AND CONSIDERATION ABOUT -- ESPECIALLY WITH TRIPLE A FUNDED FUNDS IN WITH MEDICARE WAIVERS. ABOUT DIRECTING THOSE AGENCIES THE STATE AND COUNTY AGENCIES THAT ARE RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS TO BE REQUIRED TO GIVE A HIRING PREFERENCE WERE CONTRACT SUBCONTRACT PREFERENCE. TO NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE AGING IN PLACE HOME MODIFICATION REPAIRS AND REHABILITATION. RIGHT NOW THESE PRECIOUS BONDS ARE CURRENTLY WITH GREAT FREQUENCY USED TO HIRE FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CHARGE MORE FOR THE SERVICES SO WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT WE LEVERAGE THE FUNDS INSTEAD TO PROVIDE THE SAME WORK AT LOWER COSTS FOR SENIORS VETERANS FOLKS THAT ARE DISABLED. AT A HIGH QUALITY LOWER COST AND LEVERAGE THOSE FUNDS TO SERVE MANY MORE SENIORS IN NEED. BY LEVERAGING PHILANTHROPIES AND PHILANTHROPIC WORK SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS KAREN JOHNSON WITH THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AND SALAS BESPOKE COUNTY. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY I I REALLY SUPPORT SEA BASS PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE A SEA BASS IN ST LOUIS COUNTY. THE NEAREST ONE IS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. THE CHALLENGE FOR HAVING IN ST LOUIS IS WERE HAVING A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THE MANAGE MEDI CAL PROVIDER IN OUR COUNTY IS TERMINATING COVERAGE FOR NURSING HOME. RESIDENTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. AND ARE BEING TOLD THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE NURSING HOMES THEY ARE VERY FRAIL SICK INDIVIDUALS AND THE SEA BASS WOULD IT. HELP A LOT WITH THIS PROCESS WHERE THERE WOULD BE SOMEWHERE FOR THEM TO GO AT LEAST DURING THE DAY TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE SO. I STRONGLY SUGGEST ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP FUND -- POSITIONS TO GET THEM CERTIFIED TO GET NEW PROGRAMS AND WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON LEASE A COMMON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION OF WHEAT AS AS A MEMBER ASSOCIATION MADE UP OF THE THIRTY FIVE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS -- WANT TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF WHAT CLAY WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE WAS SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING NEW. BUT YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT AND RESOURCE APPROPRIATELY THOSE PROGRAMS THAT DO EXIST AND THE SEA BASS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT GREAT COST VALUE TO THE STATE SO WE ENCOURAGE. THIS PROPOSAL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU.

BACK UP TO THE DíAS. THANK YOU I JUST NEED SOME CLARIFICATION PLEASE ON PAGE -- AT PAGE EIGHTEEN THERE'S A CHART ON WORKLOAD HISTORY. I AND THERE'S IT BY THE FIRST SECTION PERCENTAGE OF COURT QUARTERLY -- UNDER MONITORING CALLS COMPLETED AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A 201321470% ME WHAT THAT MEANS. AND WHAT IMPACT IT HAS. IF ANY ON I JUST. I SAW A SHARP DECREASE IN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO I I I THE PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS I THINK THE DEPARTMENT CAN TALK ABOUT BUT THE WORKLOAD HISTORY KIND OF DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS PROGRAM DOES NEED THE STAFF HAT WE REQUEST. GIVEN THAT. THE THE PERCENT OF CALLS THAT SHOULD BE A HUNDRED SHOULD BE UNDER THAT THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE COLLISION SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS A HUNDRED SUPPORTER BECAUSE WE MAKE QUARTERLY CALLS TO ALL -- CERTIFIED SEA BASS PROVIDERS TWO OF THEM. IT'S ONE OF OUR DESK MONITORING PROCEDURES SO WE CAN DETERMINE. WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- WITH REGARDS TO CARE WITHIN THE FACILITY WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THEM ON CONCERNS WE MADE A PATH FROM THE PRIOR MONITORING VISIT. TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF CORRECTION THAT SORT OF I'M SWELLED BUT IT'S SO I GUESS WHAT MY POINT IS IS IF YOU SEE THERE'S A SHARP DECLINE IN. IN AND YOU KNOW THE CALLS AND SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE -- REQUESTS HAVE BEEN ONE TIME ASK SOUL WHAT AT WHERE I'M GOING. WITH THIS IS THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING ONE TIME ASKS ALL THE TIME COUNT WE MAKE IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE THIS. KIND OF AN ONGOING OF FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE.

OF PROVIDERS SCREENING REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO TO TO ADDRESS THE INFLUX OF APPLICATIONS FROM. ENTITIES THEY'RE INTERESTED NOW IN THE COMING SEA BASS PROVIDERS RIGHT AND THEN SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE ONLY MONITORING TWENTY FIVE OR MAKE MONITORING WELL THE IMPACT I I MEAN SO THE THE DOWNSIDE OF NOT BEING ABLE. TO WHAT THE PROVIDER PROVIDERS THROUGH OUR QUARTERLY CALLS IS THAT THERE THERE'S INFORMATION THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE MONITORING PROCESS THAT WE MAY NOT GATHER. AND SO IT IT CREATES AN INFORMATION VOICE FOR US SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO QUARTERLY CALL.

LICENSE CARE FACILITIES CONSIST OF SKILLED NURSING HOMES INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE L. ELDERLY. LONG TERM CARE OF OMBUDSMAN SERVICE A VITAL RESOURCE TO RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE A LITTLE OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. THEY INVESTIGATE ADDRESS AND HELP RESOLVE THE COMPLAINTS OF UNSAFE CARE OR A VIOLATION OF RIGHTS RESIDENTS LIVING IN LICENSE CARE FACILITIES. 60% OF THE RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS VISITING TO OBSERVE CARE AND REPORT PROBLEMS. THERE FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROVIDES A REGULAR VISITING PRESENCE IN FACILITIES WHICH ALL RESIDENTS HAVE AN IMPERFECT IN IN IN PERSON CONTACT. OUR SENIOR POPULATION IS GROWING RAPIDLY -- WE MUST PROTECT OUR OUR SENIORS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE AN ADVOCATE. THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN THIS FUNDING WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVING IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

THAT'S FINE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LISA COLEMAN I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. I'D LIKE TO TO START BY THANKING THE STAFF FOR DOING SUCH A VERY COMPLETE AND THOROUGH REVIEW OF OUR PROPOSAL. I RECOGNIZE AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT I AM SPEAKING BEFORE A FRIENDLY AUDIENCE OF OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM SUPPORTERS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ASKING THAT THE AGENDA INFORMATION UPDATED BE -- BUT THE AGENDA INFORMATION THAT IT BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS IN THE PROGRAM. AS THE NUMBER LISTED ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR IS OUT OF DATE -- AS THE MOST RECENT SADA STATE OMBUDSMAN REPORT PUBLISHED JUST THIS MONTH INDICATES THAT THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS HAS DROPPED FROM YOUR REPORTED LIST OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS A VERY BAD YEAR. FOR RETENTION OF VOLUNTEERS. ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO USE THIS TIME TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATION OF A POTENTIAL BUDGET. STRATEGY BY USING THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT WHICH HAS A STAFFING TOO BAD RATIO. BOB. JOE RODRIGUEZ I THINK WAS MORE SUBTLE THAN I WOULD LIKE TO BE AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIRECT ON Y.. AS AN ASSOCIATION WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ONE FULL TIME EMPLOYEE TO TWO THOUSAND BEDS IS AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF MEASURE. MA'AM BE AS CANDID AS YOU NEED TO BE. I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY SO SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH THIS IS THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT REAL PEOPLE REAL PROBLEM. THIS POOR REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE USING NINETEEN NINETY THREE DATA. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE THE WORK THAT WE WERE DOING IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS THE MEASURE FOR FUNDING THE PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED. I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN GO INTO TECHNOLOGY OR BUDGETS BUT JUST. WHO HAD THAT RIGHT -- BUT IN. NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE TOP COMPLAINT THAT LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS INVESTIGATED A 21% FOR QUALITY OF CARE. 18% WERE RESIDENT RIGHTS LESS THAN 10% OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED THAT YEAR HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ABUSE. AND YET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FORTY HEARD IT REPORTED. NEARLY ONE IN EVERY FOUR COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED FELL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF ELDER ABUSE. OUR TOP GO GETTER THIS YEAR RESIDENT ON RESIDENT CONFLICT. FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY PHYSICAL NEGLECT. SO IF YOU WANT TO USE YOUR RATIO OF ONE TO TWO THOUSAND I THINK YOU HAVE TO USE THE COMPARISON THE WORKLOAD AND IT IS CHANGED SECOND. THIS PROGRAM THIS THIS REPORT IDENTIFIES MINIMUM EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE WANT TO USE THAT AS OUR STANDARD? TO START OUT OUR DISCUSSION WITH THIS BEING THE MINIMUM EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER PART OF THAT. IS THAT WHEN THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN IT'S A FEDERAL REPORT. AN OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS ARE RUN VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE ON BUT IT'S BEEN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE -- ONE CENTRAL OFFICE THAT DOES ALL OF THE PHONE INTAKE OR ALL OF THE THE THE AT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK OR THERE ARE STATES WHERE THEY HAVE A FEW LOCAL PROGRAMS. BUT CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEARD EARLIER WE BELIEVE IN THE TRIPLE A PROCESS WE BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND SO THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. IS EITHER A CONTRACTED PROGRAM OR A DOES WRECKED SERVICE PROGRAM THROUGH THE THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT STANDARD OF THE ONE TO TWO THOUSAND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACTOR IN ALL OF THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. DOING PHONE CALLS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OF INVESTMENT IN US LAST YEAR THAT EXTRA TWO POINT THREE MILLION THAT RAISING OF OUR BASE FROM THE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I AM EXCITED TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE BACK TO ANSWERING OUR PHONES AS HUMAN BEINGS. THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE. EIGHTY FIVE MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO ME NOW BECAUSE I GET FRUSTRATED PUSHING BUTTONS AND WAITING AND HOLDING BUT IF IF I DON'T HAVE A PERSONAL PHONE. IF THE ONLY WAY I CAN REACH AN OMBUDSMAN IS BY USING THE NURSES STATION PHONE. I DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO PUSH THE PHONE NUMBER FOR YOU TO CALL. TO CALL ME BACK. IT'S NOT MY LINE. AND WHAT KIND OF CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY DO I HAVE. WHEN THE PHONE LINE GOES TO THE NURSES STATION AND THE NURSES SAID ODDS THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM? SO HAVING THAT HUMAN BEING ANSWERING THE PHONE I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT INVESTMENT. GOING BACK. TO OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AT THE REPORT -- THIS REPORT. IT TALKS ABOUT -- MINIMUM AFFECTED PROGRAMS. AND THE BUDGETING THAT'S NEEDED. SO. WE'VE LEARNED TODAY THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. SO IF YOU WANT TO DO A RATIO YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO WAYS YOU EITHER. TAKE OUT OUT OF THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY ANSWERING OUR PHONES ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING ON THE INTAKE ALL OF THE SUPERVISORY OF STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. AND THE PROGRAM COORDINATORS OR YOU YOU SUBTRACT ANY EITHER WHAT YOU EITHER ADD THAT NUMBER AND TO THE RATIO. OF THE ONE TO TWO THOUSAND BEDS OR YOU SUBTRACTED FROM OUR CURRENT NUMBER OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN BOB. I I I GUESS. EIGHT A RATIO IS CERTAINLY A WAY TO FUND THE PROGRAM. AND IF YOU DO PREFER TO USE THAT -- WE YET KHALKHAL WHILE WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT IDEAS AND AND EVEN AN OPTION OF A POSSIBLE STAFF TOO BAD RATIO. OF BUT WE HAVE OTHER IDEAS ALSO AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE ALLEY -- IN THE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH THE RIGHT FIT. BUT IT HAS TO BE REALLY SOON -- SO. IT IF YOU. THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE IS THE STATE MIGHT CHOOSE TO USE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WE'VE IDENTIFIED IT HERE WHICH IS ON QUARTERLY VISITS AND THE NEED -- FOR ON THAT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY IS A REQUEST FOR FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO TO CONDUCT QUARTERLY UNANNOUNCED FACILITY VISITS BY BOTH PAID STAFF. AND HIGHLY TRAINED VOLUNTEERS. THIS PROPOSAL BUYS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOURTH THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOURS OF I'M BUT SPENT EYES AND EARS AND FACILITIES. IT BUYS THE STATE PROMPT ASSISTANCE WITH THE ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. THIS INVESTMENT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD UTILIZE STAFF INSTEAD OF RELYING SO HEAVILY ON THE THE VOLUNTEERS. BOB TO ADD TO INVESTIGATE ELDER ABUSE COMPLAINTS. YOU KNOW I'VE WE'VE ALREADY SAID ONE IN FOUR COMPLAINTS WAS ELDER ABUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAINTAIN AS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF MORE. VOLUNTEERS LEADING US WHEN I CAN MAINTAIN A ROBUST VOLUNTEER PROGRAM IF WERE ASKING VOLUNTEERS TO DO SO MUCH ELDER ABUSE INVESTIGATION. THIS STATEWIDE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM HAS BECOME SO COMPLAINT DRIVEN THAT THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO CONDUCT. REGULAR UNANNOUNCED ACILITY VISITS THE LOS ANGELES PROGRAM THEY CONDUCTED. FIVE FEWER THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR. AND YET THEY WERE ABLE TO VISIT ONLY 60% OF THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ONLY 7% OF THEIR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OMBUDSMAN'S ARE IN FACILITIES. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A REAL LIVE NINJA. AT THE END OF THE TABLE OVER THERE -- MACHEL PERIL UP FROM THE LOS ANGELES PROGRAM LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. THANK YOU THESE THAT AND THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I APOLOGIZE MY BACK. I FELT TERRIBLE WERE USED TO JUST MAKE SURE YOU TALK IN THE MIKE IS IT IS BEING TELEVISED -- MY NAME IS MICHELLE PERELLA AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF THE WISE AND HEALTHY AGING LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROS PROGRAMS SERVING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. MONITORING VISITS ARE CRITICAL TO THE FILLING THE PROMISED REVISED SAFE AND QUALITY LONG TERM CARE. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN AN OWNER OF THREE SMALL ASSISTED LIVINGS WAS ARRESTED ON FELONY ELDER ABUSE CHARGES. ONE OF HIS RESIDENCE A NINETY ONE YEAR OLD FEMALE WHO IS CONFINED TO HER BED AND HAD DIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA WAS FOUND IN THE MORNING BY HER CARE GIVER TO HAVE A FIGHT ON HER HAND. FROM A RAT. IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE. DESPITE WAS SO SEVERE THAT IT EXPOSED HER BONE. AND WHEN THE CARE GIVER LIFTED THE BLANKET OFF OF HER TO PREPARE HER FOR THE DAY I ROUTE WAS SEEN JUMPING FROM HER BODY. THERE WERE DROPPINGS AROUND HER BODY. AND WHEN HE WENT TO REMOVE THE SOFT BOOT THAT IS USED PROTECTOR FOOT ANOTHER ROUTE WAS SEEN JUMPING FROM HER AND SHE HAD BITE MARKS ON THE ARCH OF HER FOOT THAT WERE BLEEDING. ON THE CARE GIVERS ALLEGE THAT THEY INFORM THE ADMINISTRATOR AND THE OWNER. WEEKLY ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THEM. THE RESIDENT DIED NOT LONG AFTER THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AN OMBUDSMAN VISIT AT THIS FACILITY ONCE. UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO VISIT THIS FACILITY. AFTER THIS HORRIBLE INCIDENT OCCURRED. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A REGULAR PRESENCE AT THE FACILITIES. AND MANAGE THE INCREASINGLY BURGEONING CASELOADS THAT WE HAVE IT'S REALLY HARD TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU THIS TERRIBLE STORY. AND TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE FACING. IF WE COULD DO YOU CONDUCT OUR REGULAR UNANNOUNCED VISITS. WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE THIS OR AT LEAST BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION. THE THREE FACILITIES WERE SHOT DOWN -- BY COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING WITH THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE ON BUDGETS MEN AND ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RESOURCES WERE REQUIRED TO AID IN THAT PROCESS AND WE'RE INVESTIGATING AND ARE NOW PROSECUTING. AND WHILE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THESE EFFORTS TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR THIS RESIDENT. IT'S COSTLY AND IT'S A LINK THE PATH TO RESOLUTION. THIS PRESIDENT WAS RELYING ON CARE GIVERS FOR EVERYTHING SHE NEEDED SHE WAS RELIANT ON THE OWNER OF THIS FACILITY TO GIVE HER A SAFE HOME. AND SHE WAS RELIANT ON THE OMBUDSMAN TO BE THERE TO PROTECT HER RATES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM DIDN'T BREAK DOWN AND WE ALL FAILED HER. FOR A SMALL INVESTMENT. CALIFORNIA CAN MOVE CLOSER TO FOR FILLING THE PROMISED PROVIDE SAFE AND QUALITY CARE. FOR LONG TERM RESIDENTS. YOU CAN MAKE THIS POSSIBLE BY ADEQUATELY FUNDING OUR PROGRAMS. AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND REALLY THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO WHY DON'T WE TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT CHEN [inaudible] YEAH. AN AFTERNOON I'M GARY PASSED MORE WITH THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS. AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS SESSION BEFORE. UP BY THAT I MEAN THIS MAN YOU KNOW THAT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMS TO ME AND MEMBERS. MEMBERS OF MY ORGANIZATION. GO BACK AND RE READ [inaudible] HAMMOND. WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE? STILL STUCK IN FACILITIES. AND INSTITUTIONS CARING FOR THEM IN CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT NUMBER WILL PROBABLY NEVER GO DOWN MUCH. BOB. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONDITIONS LIKE ADVANCED DEMENTIA THAT REQUIRE THAT PEOPLE LIVE IN AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. SO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND 60% OF THEM HAVE NO FAMILY MEMBER. TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR CARE TO WATCH AND TO SEEK AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT OR REPORT PROBLEMS. THAT MEANS THERE ARE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TODAY. IN A FACILITY THAT HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE THAT HAVE NO HELP. AND THEY ALSO HAVE NO LEGISLATORS WILLING TO INVEST IN THEIR CARE. AND I URGE YOU I URGE YOU TO PLEASE CHANGE THIS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. DURING EL FARO AND I'VE BEEN FIVE YEARS AS A VOLUNTEER OF OF FOR A BUT IT'S BEEN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.

AND AN INCREASE OUR FUNDING ESPECIALLY FOR UNANNOUNCED VISITS IN FACILITIES. IN A I'LL SPEAK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ONE DAY IN ONE WEEK OF MAKING AN UNANNOUNCED VISIT. I HAD -- A RESIDENT. SCREAMING FOR HELP. SHE NEEDED IN A TO COME BUT WAS TOLD TO JUST URINATE IN HER BED. AND ASKED ME TO PLEASE GET SOME HELP FOR HER THAT'S THAT'S ONE TO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WAS SITTING IN FECES.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I DID TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE HEARING FROM IRAQ DIRECTOR -- WOULD YOU CARE. TO COMMENT ON THIS WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL BUT WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH MISS COMMON IN YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE ANY. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR TO WORK THROUGH THE PROPOSAL WITH THE WONDERFUL. I THINK THIS IS WELL AS THE NEXT FEW ADVOCACY PROPOSALS ARE REGARD TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. ALL SEEM TO NATURALLY RELATE TO WHAT COULD BE IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. OF COURSE GIVEN THE DECADES LONG ADVOCACY EFFORTS TO RESTORE THOSE PROGRAMS WITH ONLY SMALLER PARTIAL SUCCESSES WANT TO SEE WHAT WHAT STRIDES WE CAN MAKE IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET. FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IT SEEMS. LIKE WE'RE GENUINELY. CHEN YOU ANALLY UNDER FUNDING A VALUED ROLE WE'RE BOTH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STATE MANDATES ARE GOING UNFULFILLED BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESOURCES. THIS IS AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION -- TO PLEASE REACT TO THE ISSUES OF FEDERAL COMPLIANCE RAISED IN THE AGENDA AND IF THE ADVOCACY REQUEST. WOULD ALLOW FOR US TO REACH COMPLIANCE. I'M GONNA HAVE MISTER RODRIGUEZ TRANSPLANT [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEIZING. AS I AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THE THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE DOESN'T ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE RECOMMENDED RATIO OF ONE TO TWO THOUSAND WHICH WE KNOW. IS A IS A VERY OLD RATIO AND DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN US THOSE ELDER ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE WITNESSING OF ADVANCE DIRECTIVES. AS I INDICATED FROM THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE. IF YOU GO BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE RATIO WE WOULD NEED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WORKING IN FACILITIES DEALING WITH THESE RESIDENTS. ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS AND ADVOCATING FOR THEM. RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN F. T. E.'S. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T IN FACILITIES. BUT RATHER THE ADMINISTRATORS AND MANAGERS OF PROGRAMS -- IN ORDER TO TO TO BETTER ADDRESS FACILITY COVERAGE. HERE IN THE STATE -- WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF. TO MAKE THOSE NON COMPLAINT RELATED VISITS EACH QUARTER OF THE YEAR -- THOSE VISITS ARE ARE CRITICALLY NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE SAFE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING ADDRESSED. AND TO BE PROACTIVE IN DEALING WITH PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY BECOME COMPLAINTS [inaudible] I THINK. THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS THOUGH. THAT IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT. LISI'S -- LEASES A PROPOSAL WITH THAT ALLOW YOU TO COMPLY. I BELIEVE IT WOULD. I THINK IT. I WOULD LIKE. TO TRY TO SEE. HOW WE CAN TOGETHER ADVANCE THE MAIN FIVE POINT TWO MILLION ADVOCACY REQUEST? SO IN TANDEM NOT INSTEAD OF I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR CDA AND DEPARTMENT FINANCES HELP ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BASIS. PLEASE WORK WITH THE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION ON THE REQUEST. FOR THE REVISED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THE STATE HEALTH FACILITIES CITATION PENALTIES ACCOUNT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS WOULD MEAN CONSULTING WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS TO CONSIDER HOW THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE. CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THAT FUND. I WILL TELL YOU THAT LAST YEAR I AUTHORED. EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY AND THIS IS ONE I REALIZED. THE VERY CRITICALLY UNDER FUNDED STATE OF THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. AND IT TO HAVE RECEIVED FINALLY A COST OF LIVING INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. OF IT AFTER SO MANY YEARS -- I I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE THE WHAT THE ADVOCATES -- BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. BECAUSE AND THEN LISTENING TO THE VOLUNTEERS THOSE OF YOU HERE AND THOSE THAT WE HAVE READ ABOUT ANECDOTALLY -- IT IS CLEAR. WITHOUT ANY ANY. DOUBT THAT WITHOUT THE THE VOLUNTEERS. EVEN THE LITTLE THAT IS DONE COULD NOT BE DONE. AND SO I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK ALL OF YOU. WHO ARE AND WHO HAVE BEEN VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE OUR SENIORS WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED IF YOU WERE NOT THERE OF I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU REGISTRATION IF YOU'RE AGREEABLE TO THE REQUESTS THAT I JUST PRESENTED. WHAT TO SAY THAT THE TO FUND YOU MENTION ONE THE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUNDS UNDER DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEN THE? QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE FUND THAT'S ALSO UNDER THE PARM HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD HAVE TO CORNING WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE BUT WE'RE HAPPY. TO GAUGE IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. WELL. NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I DO WANT TO COMMITMENT. IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO INSTEAD OF SAY WE WILL TRY. WE HAVE TO DO IT WE HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE. BECAUSE LOTS OF WORK HAS GONE INTO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE THE SUSTAINABLE. AND IF IF THERE HAVE BEEN. IF THERE'S ALREADY BEEN WORK DONE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN GET THE MONEY TO MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE WE REALLY OWE IT TO THE ADVOCATES. TO FIND OUT. IF THIS IS DOABLE AND IF IT IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. BUT IT TAKES US BACK TO THE THE TO THE MASTER PLAN. OUR OUR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE TALKED ABOUT THIS. SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE IT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE HAVE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE NEED A MASTER PLAN. OUR DOCTOR WOULD JUST TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED A MASTER PLAN. OUR GOVERNOR HAS NOW TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED A MASTER PLAN. WE'RE GOING TO GET A MASTER PLAN. AND I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION -- IN THE IN THE LAST -- SUB ONE A HEARING THAT WE HAD THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR MILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDY. SO WE'RE GOING TO STUDY WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR SENIORS ARE. AND THEN WHAT. WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN WITH WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT. WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY THEN IT BECOMES MEANINGLESS AND THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE SPENT ON THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM INSTEAD OF SPENDING ON STUDY. WE HAVE AN IDEA ALREADY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. AND IT ISN'T TO SAY THAT SOMEONE'S OF FOLDER SOMEONE'S NOT AT FAULT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER I SHARED THE STORY LAST TIME THAT I I ONCE A WEEK. OR WHAT ONE WEEK PER YEAR I SPENT ON SENIOR ADVOCACY IN MY DISTRICT WERE ALL WE DO IS WE VISIT ALL OF OUR SENIOR CENTERS ARE HOUSING EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH MY SENIORS. AND I THE NUMBER GOES UP FRONT WAS FOURTEEN NOW LAST LAST YEAR WAS TWENTY SOMETHING -- SO WE BRING IN EXPERTS WE WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WE LISTEN TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. BUT THE STORY I WANTED TO TELL YOU IS THAT I WAS TELLING MY MOTHER. MOM I'M SO EXCITED I AM DOING THIS WHOLE WEEK WITH ALL THE SENIORS IN. A WE'RE FINDING OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND I'M SO EXCITED BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT I'M GOING TO REPRESENT MY SENIORS IS TO KNOW WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. AND SHE LOOKS AT ME SHE SAYS ME HE DONE REMEMBER YOU TO OUR SENIOR. SO I'M TALKING ABOUT MYSELF I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT I HAVE THIS WELL. AND SO WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER I KNOW THE WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS. BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SAY BEYOND JUST -- THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. AND I REALIZE WE ARE THAT YOU YOU WERE THE ACTING -- DIRECTOR AND I'M SO PROUD TO HAVE YOU THERE -- TO TO HAVE YOU LEADING THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT -- DEPARTMENT AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE MEMBERS HERE THE TWO HAVE WILLING PARTICIPANTS YOU HAVE PARTNERS HERE. AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU WE WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR YOU BECAUSE WHEN WE ADVOCATE FOR YOU AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR EVERYBODY IN OUR DISTRICT. AND ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH BLESSED ENOUGH TO REACH THE AGE OF BEING CALLED A SENIOR. SO DO COUNT ON US COUNT ON US AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE ADVOCATES. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BUDGET. THERE ARE LIMITED FUNDS WE KNOW THAT WE TO FIGURE OUT. WHETHER WE'RE GONNA SPEND IT HERE WE'RE GONNA SPEND THEIR BUT WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE. NOT LIVING A DIGNIFIED LIFE ANYMORE AFTERALL THERE YEAR THEIR YEARS OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND GIVING TO THE COMMUNITY AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE FINAL YEARS AND WE JUST TOSS THEM AWAY. AND IT'S WRONG. IT'S ABSOLUTELY WRONG AND THEN LIKE YOU SAID WE CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE ON THAT WE WE WE WE ARE IN A POSITION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND WE WILL. WE WILL BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY OF YOU HERE WERE WILLING TO WORK HARD ON THIS ALL I HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE VOLUNTEERS IF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE WILLING TO PUT IN ALL THOSE HOURS. AND I FOUND OUT LAST YEAR HOW MANY HOURS ARE VOLUNTEERS ARE PUTTING IN AND I KNEW FOR SURE. THAT IF THOSE VOLUNTEERS EVER LEFT US -- GOD SAVE US SO IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE SO AWFUL. BUT TO COUNT ON US WE WANT TO WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT TOGETHER THIS MASTER PLAN. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TALKED ABOUT IN THAT SO MANY UP HERE OF TALKED ABOUT WE'VE GOT TO DO IT. SO THAT WE CAN THEN SAY OKAY HERE'S OUR PLAN ALL RIGHT SO WE CAN'T FIND 1100% OF IT. LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT NOW LET'S DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND LET'S NOT DUPLICATE IN AN AREA THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE DUPLICATED. BUT NO WE ARE HERE TO WORK WITH YOU WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND WE WILL WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU. YES MISTER FRAZIER. BUT I'M SURE YOU STOLEN MY TALKING POINTS BUT AND SO -- ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO HAVE CLARIFICATION -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FORMULA? ON THE OMBUDSMAN AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE AD MEN AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HIS RING PHONES AND WHAT NOT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING OUT IN THE FIELD. SO WE HAVE [inaudible] APPROXIMATELY -- A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED NINETY PAID STAFF YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME AND GO. NOT ALL THOSE NOT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ARE FULL TIME INDIVIDUALS AS AS WE REFERENCED EARLIER SOME OF THOSE ARE PART TIME STAFF. AS OF THE END OF SEPTEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAD SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY CERTIFIED OMBUDSMAN VOLUNTEERS. WHO ALSO PERFORMED THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THE PAID STAFF DO THEY GO THROUGH THE SAME EXACT TRAINING? THOSE VOLUNTEERS THOSE HOURS VERY PEOPLE. ARE GENERALLY ASKED TO GIVE AT LEAST TWENTY HOURS A MONTH. FOR HOURS A WEEK WE KNOW THAT THAT VOLUNTEERS GIVE A LOT MORE THAN FOUR HOURS A WEEK -- WITH THOSE LIMITED RESOURCES BOTH STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS -- AND THE SHEER SIZE OF OUR STATE AND THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES WE HAVE IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO GET OUT EVERY QUARTER OF THE YEAR. EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE WE HAVE PROGRAMS. IN THE FAR NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VOLUNTEER AND MODOC. IT'S GOING TO TAKE STAFF. FIVE TO SIX HOURS TO GET THERE BY CAR -- AS A STATE STATED EARLIER THE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED -- SIMPLY DO NOT DO NOT SUPPORT THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE RECOMMENDED RATIO SO. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE MANAGERS THROUGH THE CHAIR IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT A PROPOSAL. TO BRING US TO AT LEAST COMPLIANCE. AND NOT A MINIMIZATION OF WHAT WILL WORK WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PASSION THAT ARE CHAIR HAS AND THIS WHOLE PANEL? WE LOOK ABOUT. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BE APPROPRIATELY CARING FOR SENIOR CITIZENS? IN THESE CARE FACILITIES. WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROGRAM. IN THE ID DEPOPULATION WHATSOEVER. SO IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS WE NEED TO DO A RIGHT AND NOT MINIMIZE IT. HANDS GO FORWARD WITH A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY. I'M SEEING FEDERAL -- INVESTMENT CRIME SCENE A VERY SMALL STATE INVESTMENT [inaudible] CAN COMPARISON. AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. AS A STATE TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND DO THIS AND I APPRECIATE. MISTER WOODS COMMITMENT TO BRINGING THE BAR UP. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT I THINK WE HAVE MANY STEPS TO GO BEFORE WE CAN DO IT. APPROPRIATELY. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT WHITE PAPER. WHEN YOU CAN DO IT? I THINK WE ALL LIKE TO FRAZIER WHITE PAPERS. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER OF DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH I JUST LIKE TO SAY A PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR THE TO MEMBERS THANK YOU THE CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK EVERYONE WHO'S PRESENTED HERE TODAY I THINK THAT. I THINK THIS THIS THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE ASK OF FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS IS A IS SIGNIFICANT. AND I I DO BELIEVE IT'S A SOLID IT'S A SOLID PROPOSAL -- I A MOST CONCERNED WITH THAT GOING FORWARD IN THE NEXT YEAR -- WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS AS BUDGET PROPOSALS COME OUT SO WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS HAVE TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND ASK FOR THE SAME FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS THIS SHOULD BE A FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR ASK? AND THAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE BASE LINE GOING FORWARD WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE ASK FOR THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND GO BACK TO IS A REALLY CRITICAL NUMBER HERE 60% OF THE PEOPLE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND AND AND AND CARE FACILITIES. DON'T HAVE A REGULAR VISITOR TO SEE THEM THIS PROGRAM IS SO ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL OF THAT AND EVEN IF THE WAY THEIR STAFF NOW THEY CAN ONLY GET IN IN THE REPRESENT FOR MY COUNTY CAN ONLY MAKE IT TO LESS THAN 20%. OF THE BEDS THAT NEED TO BE VISITED SO -- SO I I URGE THE SUPPORT AIRS THE ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT US -- AND RECOGNIZE TO THAT YOU KNOW THESE THESE CHALLENGES AND THANK YOU TO THE LONG TERM CARE ODDS BUT TO OUR REPRESENTATIVE HERE FOR SAYING THIS. WHEN YOU START WHEN YOU START ADDING RURAL COMMUNITIES TO THIS AND THE TRAVEL TIME TO GET FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER YOU'VE ADDED A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY? THIS IS IN MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT URBAN LOS ANGELES RE CAN GO VERY CLOSELY TO VISIT A LOT OF PLACES YOU'VE GOT TO DRIVE HOURS AND HOURS SOMETIMES. TO COVER A LOT OF GROUND TO TO VISIT FACILITIES SO I JUST HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS. MISTER RAMOS THIS REAL QUICK -- MADAM CHAIR ON SOME OF THE DATA THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS USING NINETEEN NINETY FIVE DATA. IN ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON AND TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THIS OUT ALSO START TO ADDRESS THAT OR IS THAT MORE AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. I THINK THE DATA IS MORE RELATIVE TO THIS TO THE THE STAFFING RECOMMENDATIONS -- I TRUST ME I DON'T LIKE WORKING ON TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD THAT EITHER WEEK I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW WE FIX THAT -- HECK YOUKNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF OUR RESERVOIRS IN CALIFORNIA WERE OPERATING ON SIXTY YEAR OLD DATA TO DECIDE HOW MUCH WATER BE RELEASED DURING RAINSTORMS SO -- SO YEAH NO I'M SO YOU KNOW SO SO THE DAD IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND AND BUT WE'RE OPERATE ON THE BEST DATA WE HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT THAT ISSUE THE THE INSTEAD OF MEDICINE REPORT IS AND HOW WE ALLOCATE FUNDING TO LOCAL PROGRAMS -- THE RESULT OF THE BILLS -- AUTHORED BY. THE THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE HERE LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY BILL. FIVE FIFTY THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE BASELINE FUNDING FOR THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM RIGHT NOW EACH LOCAL PROGRAM -- I'M SORRY PRIOR TO TO THIS YEAR EACH LOCAL PROGRAM RECEIVED A BASELINE FUNDING OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS JUST. TO OPEN YOUR DOORS [inaudible] THAT. AMOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THROUGH -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAISES WORK AND THIS COMMITTEE -- THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION SOUGHT FIT TO INCREASE THAT BASELINE FROM THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH PROGRAM. THE REMAINING FEDERAL AND AND STATE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE ARE THEN ALLOCATED. TO EACH PROGRAM BASED ON A FORMULA. 50% BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES 40% BASED ON THE NUMBER OF BEDS IN THAT SERVICE AREA AND THEN 10% BASED ON THE SQUARE MILEAGE OF THAT SERVICE AREA. THAT'S HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE LOCAL PROGRAMS. YOUR WE WELCOME MR MATHIS A SO. UNLIKE DECO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT SORT OF AND SAID -- BUT MISTER WAS AN OLIVE GREEN OTHERS DEFINITELY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. ON THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH IS THERE SHOULD BE -- I TOO WOULD LIKE TO HELP WITH THE TRAILER LANGUAGE -- AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL SIDE TO GET THAT FORMULA CHANGED -- I HAVE NO PROBLEM BY. COMING ONTO AN AJ ARE WITH -- MAYBE MISTER WAS OR ALL OF US. ON TO ASK THAT COULD CHANGE. TO I CAN THINK OF CALIFORNIA OKAY LIKE I CAN ALSO SPEAK TO THAT THE THE THE ALLEN THE FUNNY ALLOCATION IS IN. THE WELL FOR INSTITUTIONS CODE IN CALIFORNIA LAW BUT THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING IS CONDUCTING A NEW EVALUATION OF LONG TERM CARE BUTTON PROGRAM. THAT WILL UPDATE THAT RATIO SO. THAT IS IMMINENT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THAT IS AGAIN A FEDERAL STANDARD. THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA MANDATES WHICH WE DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT. RESIDENTS HAVE WITNESSING -- ACTIONS FOR ADVANCE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE AND WE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF THE OMBUDSMAN BEING THAT AND MICHELLE RECEIVER OF ELDER ABUSE ALLEGATIONS THAT THAT SHOULD CONTINUE THERE'S ONLY FOUR OTHER STATES IN THE NATION THAT HAVE THAT SO THIS FEDERAL STANDARD ONE INCLUDE SOME. SOME SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD FOR US IN A MANTHAT'S WHY MISSION. AS THE MEMBERS HERE ALL SUPPORTIVE THAT WE CAN DO AN AJ ARE ASKING THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT. TO POSSIBLY CHANGE THEIR FORMULA FOR BUT CALIFORNIA. GOOD LUCK TO US ON THAT QUESTION. BOB YET MAYBE WILL PUT IT IN ON MY NAME. WE JUST MIGHT HAVE. TO SO AT MY LAST QUESTION. IF THE IF THE INVESTMENT IS MADE TO AUGMENT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM TO FUND THE ABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM TO VISIT ALL FACILITIES. ON AT LEAST A QUARTERLY. QUARTERLY BASIS. THEN I THINK THE SUGGESTION IS THAT WE HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- TO CODIFY. THIS PRACTICE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE A REACTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. MY MY ONLY CONCERN WITH WITH CODIFYING THAT. IS THAT -- SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRY ADMINISTRATION DECIDE TO AUGMENT THIS PROGRAM WITH THIS REQUEST. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GET BAD AGAIN AND WE LOSE MONEY? IF WE HAVE THIS ON THE BOOKS WE'RE WE'RE WE'VE GOT A MANDATE THAT WE CAN'T MEET. THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN. IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT STANDARD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING WANTS US TO STRIVE [inaudible] FOR BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR FUNDING. AND THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE FROM CONGRESS. ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT IN EVERY STATE. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT IF WE DON'T SET A STANDARD AND THAT'S WHY I THE FIRST PART OF MY SENTENCE WAS. IF AN INVESTMENT IS MADE TO AUGMENT IT. DO THEN CODIFY IT BECAUSE IF. WE AUGMENTED THE IF WE INCREASE THE FUNDING. AND WE DON'T CODIFY IT THEN I I I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. BUT CLEARLY. THERE COULD BE THAT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR SOMETHING ELSE. WHERE IS IF WE CODIFY IT THEN WE ARE SAYING THIS IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THERE NEED TO BE QUARTERLY -- VISITS. ARE UNANNOUNCED VISITS AS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN TESTIFIED TO THERE HAVE TO BE QUARTERLY VISITS WITH THEM ARE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS IN A BETTER WAY THAN WE'RE ABLE TO NOW -- IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD CHANGE THEN CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABSOLUTE POWER TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE ALSO OF WHAT IS REQUIRED OF YOU. IF IT'S AN UNFUNDED MANDATE WE'RE TELLING YOU YOU'VE GOT TO GO OVER A QUARTER AND YET WE GIVE YOU ENOUGH TO JUST GO ONCE A YEAR -- THE LEGISLATURE JUST AS WE WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WORK WITH YOU THEM. WE CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU CANNOT. YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING. FOR PLEASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING -- I HAVE DONE A QUICK POLL OF OUR MEMBERS. AND THAT BY AND LARGE THE MEMBERS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF BEING GIVEN SOME GUIDELINES. THAT CONCERNS ARE THAT IT NOT HAPPEN ON JULY FIRST THAT YOU. GIVE US FIVE POINT TWO MILLION AND EXPECT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT. ARE HIGHER BARK IT WILL TAKE US A NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET FROM SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX VOLUNTEERS BACK UP. TO THE THOUSAND OR MORE THAT WE NEED AS WELL AS TRAINING STAFF THIS IS NOT A JOB THAT YOU CAN WALK IN ON MONDAY AND DO IT ON FRIDAY. SO IF YOU GIVE US A FEW YEARS OF TIME TO GO FROM OUR 60% COMPLIANCE OP. THE OTHER PART TO CONSIDER IS THERE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PERCENTAGE OF BLOCKS JUST A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IF S. A FACILITY IS NAMED ABC IN THE VERY FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR. AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THE CHANGE ON OUR SHIP AND ON THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE YEAR. THEY TURN INTO X. Y. Z. FACILITY. THE OMBUDSMAN'S CURRENT REPORTING STATUS WOULD SAY YOU VISITED ABC IN THE FIRST QUARTER BUT YOU DID NOT VISIT THEM IN THE SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER. THEY DIDN'T EXIST. SO YOU WE GOT DETAINED FOR THAT ONE ABC FACILITY AND THEN BECAUSE YOU NOW HAVE THE X. Y. Z. FACILITY THAT IS OPEN AND YOU VISITED THEM SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER YOU WOULD STILL BE DOING. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET TO THAT FACILITY ALL FOUR QUARTERS WAR YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF FACILITIES THAT WERE IN FIRES THOSE FACILITIES BURNED DOWN THERE WOULD BE NO POINT IN GOING TO VISIT A FACILITY. THAT HAS BEEN OPENED SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU DON'T EXPECT A 100% IF YOU SAID MAYBE 8085% WELL RATHER THAN SAY PERCENTAGE. I I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO IF. THE OMBUDSMAN APPROACH. PEOPLE WERE TO COME TO US AND SAY. THIS FACILITY BURNED DOWN SO WE CAN'T IN -- VISIT. RIGHT THE LANGUAGE WOULD CERTAINLY BE PUT IN I WOULD THAT HAPPEN WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE YES WE KNOW WHAT THE CONCEPT IS WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. SO IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MONEY IN IS GOING TO REQUIRE THE LANGUAGE TO CODIFY IT IS TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THE MONEY ON YEAH. WE ARE IS ALL WE WERE ABLE WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY. AND THEN HOW WE'RE GOING -- TO CODIFY THE THE THE REQUIREMENTS. THAT WE WANT. FOR WHICH WE WANT THAT MONEY TO BE SPENT. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER ON THAT AND WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON THE LANGUAGE SO I DO APPRECIATE TO THE THE MINISTRATIONS -- WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US -- WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE YOU TO AS MY MOTHER SAY IT WILL ONE DAY BE THAT SENIOR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALL. LET'S BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL THIS PANEL NUMBER FOUR IS -- GETTING SITUATED ON PANEL -- FIVE DOCTOR WOULD IS ALSO ONE OF THE PANELISTS. AND A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE I WOULD HOUSE THAT HE GIVE HIS TESTIMONY NOW. TO PROVE IT JUST IN CASE YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO RETURN AND A TIMELY MANNER.

I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS -- OUR GRATITUDE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU -- AND HIS ABLE AND GENEROUS STAFF FOR REALLY HAVING THE BIG PICTURE THINKING. TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING FORWARD A REQUEST. DOT COM IS COMPREHENSIVE AND WOULD REALLY -- IMPACT IN A SYSTEMS CHANGE WAY ARM THIS PROPOSAL. OF A FAMILY MEMBER CHOOSE -- REQUEST FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE POINT NINE TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUNDING. FOR THIS YEAR -- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING -- TO SUPPORT TO BUILD LOCAL IF INSTANCE CAPACITY WITH STEPPED IN INCREASES IN TWO SUBSEQUENT YEARS AROUND THOSE ARE WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS -- THAT THE EMPHASIS P.. ASSOCIATION IS IS SEEN NEEDED IN YOUR TO IN YOUR THREE ARM. FIFTH LONG OVERDUE FUNDING REQUEST IS UP IT'S REALLY IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN A CONTINUUM I THINK ONE OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS. ARE MENTIONED THAT AGING IS A CONTINUUM. ARM AND THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO SENIORS THE THE THE THING THE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COMPOUND IN THE COMMUNITY NEED TO BE A CONTINUUM AS WELL -- SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SERVE THOSE IN ACUTE CARE FACILITIES. ARMS THOSE WHO ARE -- A NURSING HOME LEVEL BUT STILL WANT TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES. THOSE WHO. REALLY NEED PREVENTION SERVICES THEY NEED NAVIGATION -- WE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UPSTREAM -- THIS REQUEST INCORPORATES. ALL OF THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR OMBUDSMAN AND A FIFTY AND SENIOR NUTRITION THAT CLAY IS ABOUT TO SPEAK ON END I AM. YOU ARE YOU'VE HEARD -- FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS ABOUT OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT. REALLY BEING A DISINVESTMENT THAT THE GENERAL FUNDING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TODAY IS. IS ESSENTIALLY HALF WHAT IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IF YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION. BOMB FOUND OUR REQUEST TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT. I I THINK THAT THE IMPACT OF OF THIS CHRONIC DOES DISINVESTMENT HAS REALLY BEEN FELT LOCALLY AND YOU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SPEAKERS TODAY ABOUT. THE IMPACT THE LOCAL IMPACT AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN CONSIDER OUR REQUEST. AS A REQUEST FROM THE FIELD -- OUR LOCAL PROVIDERS EVERY DAY WE SEE THE REALITY OF OLDER ADULTS GRAPPLING WITH ECONOMIC AND SECURITY WITH ISOLATION WITH HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY. WITH HEALTH AND MOBILITY CHALLENGES -- AND THE TASK OF NAVIGATING COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE EXPERIENCING AN URGENT NEED. TO INVEST IN ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE CAN'T DO IT PIECEMEAL THE CONTINUUM NEEDS TO BE FUNDED -- THIS IS A MODEST INVESTMENT. AROUND IT RESTORES FUNDING TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LEVELS WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR INFLATION. I I URGE YOU. TO NOT TO WAIT FOR STUDY I URGE YOU NOT TO WAIT FOR THE MASTER PLAN WE NEED THIS BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE OF SERVICES. IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD INTO ANYTHING THAT'S BETTER. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO NOW CALL ON CLAY CAMP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. SANTA CRUZ SAN BENITO AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND THANKS ICE I SHOULD ALSO MENTION I'M LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR. FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING SOME BRING A COUPLE HATS -- FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO REALLY THANK ASSEMBLYMAN CHIU AND WINDY PETERSON FOR THEIR PROPOSAL IT'S A IT SHOULD BE THE STARTING POINT THIS SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM THAT WE DO AND THIS IS HOW WE FIX WHAT IS LITERALLY A BROKEN SYSTEM. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE START BY FIXING WHAT WAS BROKEN TEN YEARS AGO. BY PUTTING BACKING AND WHAT WORK BEFORE. AND AFTER THAT THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE GROWTH. IN THE POPULATION AND FIGURE OUT BETTER WAYS TO DO THINGS BUT I THINK THIS IS THE STARTING POINT. REGARDING THE NUTRITION ASK SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S NO STANDARD ABOUT HOW MANY SENIORS CAN GO HUNGRY. THERE'S NO PERCENTAGE -- CALCULATION ABOUT WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE THERE'S NO CALCULATION ABOUT HOW MANY SENIOR SHOULD BE EATING DOG FOOD IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE KNOW THAT IS HAPPENING. THAT'S REALLY WHAT DROVE THE CREATION OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT IT WENT AWAY FOR AWHILE BUT NOW WITH THE STAGNATION OF FUNDING OR THE LOSS OF FUNDING. THE D. INVESTMENTS. THAT'S BECOME A REALITY AGAIN AND WE'RE HEARING DIRECT STORIES IN OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT THAT HAPPENING. IT'S REALLY NOT OK. WE ALSO KNOW THERE IS ONE POINT TWO MILLION. SENIORS THAT ARE FOOD INSECURE. RIGHT NOW OUR MEAL PROGRAMS ARE FEEDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION SENIORS PER YEAR SO. MY LACK OF ACTION AND BY NOT FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS WERE BASICALLY SAYING THAT THE STANDARD IS. THAT IT'S OKAY THAT 80% OF OUR AT RISK SENIORS GO HUNGRY. OR THE EAT POOR MEALS. AND THAT'S REALLY TO ME YOU KNOW I LOVE MY STATES BUT THAT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT THAT WERE SAYING THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE SENIORS IN ME FACING HUNGER FACING THE CHOICE BETWEEN A MEAL. AND THEIR MEDICATION OR OTHER ESSENTIAL. MY SUSTAINING ACTIVITIES THAT THEY HAVE TO GO WITHOUT FOOD. PROGRAMS I MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE SURVIVED BY. CREATIVE APPROACHES TO KEEPING THEIR PROGRAMS OPEN. BY NOT PAYING STAFF WAGE INCREASES FOR A DECADE. AND WHAT WE DO WITH THAT IS WE CREATE A POVERTY REALITY FOR EVERYBODY PROVIDING THESE TYPES OF SERVICES IF YOU WANT TO DO GOOD IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND SERVE SENIORS. AND YOU'RE A STAFFER. YOU HAVE TO DECIDE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A VOW OF POVERTY YOURSELF AND END UP MEETING THE SAME SERVICES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP THE COMMUNITY. RECEIVING HALF. AND THAT'S NOT OKAY. AND I THINK ALL OF US AND I APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE HAVING PASSING AROUND THESE ISSUES. AND IT'S IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE THAT THERE'S PASSION HERE ABOUT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE ALSO HAVE FEWER PROVIDERS THAT WE CAN FIND TO GET SERVICES FROM MANY OF OUR CONTRACT TO PROVIDERS ARE JUST BREAKING CONTRACTS OR SAYING NO MORE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEED. ON THE POOR REIMBURSEMENT RATE THE TRIPLE A.'S OR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES ARE PROVIDING. AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS NOT ONLY WHEN SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET A MEAL I THINK THAT PART IS EASY TO GRASP. WE HAVE DATA AND AND A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW. POOR NUTRITION LEADS TO INCREASED HEALTH COSTS INCREASED INSTITUTIONALIZATION INCREASE STROKES INCREASED HEART ATTACKS NONE OF WHICH IS OKAY. BUT THE CUTS PROGRAMS ARE BEING FACED TO MATE. OUR DRASTIC AND I DON'T THINK WE HEAR ABOUT THOSE IN EARLIER I MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF ONE STRATEGY IS RATHER THAN VISITING AT SENIOR EVERY DAY WITH THE HOME DELIVERED MEALS. A LOT OF PROGRAMS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO DELIVER FROZEN MEALS BE THERE ONCE A WEEK OR OR WHATEVER AND ONE OF OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS IS FACING THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE DISCUSSION SHOULD THEY START PROVIDING FROZEN MEALS AND VISIT ONCE A WEEK OR NOT. AND THIS LAST YEAR DURING ONE OF THEIR HOME VISITS AND DELIVERIES THEY FOUND A CLIENT LYING ON THE FLOOR IN HER OWN WAY STE WHO'D BEEN THERE SINCE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE. SHE HAD FALLEN COULDN'T GET UP. AND LUCKILY WAS RESCUED BY HER DRIVER WHO SAW THIS AND CALLED AUTHORITIES AND SHE WAS ABLE TO BE TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL IN REHYDRATED IN AND BASICALLY RECOVERED AND CONTINUES. TO LIVE AT HOME TODAY. NOW IF THIS PROVIDER HAS TO CUT CORNERS ONE MORE TIME AND ONLY DELIVER MEALS ONCE A WEEK THAT PERSON WOULD BE DEAD. IN AND THAT'S THE REALITY IN THE CHOICE THEY WERE PUTTING OUR PROVIDERS IN. THE EITHER HAVE TO KNOW THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THEY SERVE WILL DIE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STOP MAKING DAILY DELIVERIES OR A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE PEOPLE IN NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITY WILL GO HUNGRY. AND THEY'LL DIE ALSO BUT IT WOULD BE A SLOWER LONGER DEATH THAT THEY'LL BE LIVING AN EXTENDED PERIOD. OF OCT IN AN INSTITUTION OR WITH OTHER HELP. SO JUST TO WRAP OP YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY. THESE ARE GOOD TIMES. I'M STAFF IS MENTIONED IN HERE THIS IS A REQUEST THAT'S BEEN HERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN A ROW I FORGET IF THIS IS YOUR THREE OR YOUR FOR BUT IT'S CAN BE IT'S COME HERE MANY TIMES. IT'S NEVER BEEN FUNDED. PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE BASIC SERVICES BEEN FEEDING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE MEALS ON WHEELS WE ALL KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THAT IS YET IN GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES. WE'RE NOT FUNDING THIS PROGRAM. IF WE'RE NOT FINDING IN NOW WHEN ARE YOU GOING. TO AND WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO OVER EXTEND OUR RESOURCES BECAUSE WE KNOW AT SOME POINT THE ECONOMY WILL TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHEN THAT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAPPENS WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA CUT THESE PROGRAMS AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS EVERY CYCLE AGING PROGRAMS GET CUT AND REDUCED SO DURING THE GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES IF WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS I MET ME NOW. WHEN ARE WE EVER GOING TO DO IT? AND FOR NEVER GOING TO DO IT. SHAME ON ALL OF US AND I I'M NOT TWENTY TO ALL OF YOU BUT I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IF WE CANNOT PROVIDE THESE CRITICAL SERVICES. WHERE FAILING AS A STATE MORALLY FISCALLY AND REALLY PROBABLY EVER EVERY MEASURE OF WHAT A QUALITY LIFE IS FOR OUR RESIDENTS OURSELVES AND OUR RELATIVES? SO HOPEFULLY THIS REQUEST -- WILL GAIN SUPPORT THIS TIME AROUND AND WE WILL -- BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS THIS KEY AND BASIC ISSUE AND HE THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU -- DIRECTOR MOTOR. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS WERE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH [inaudible] YOUR STAFF. IN THE TROUBLING AT WORK TO REVIEW THE PROPOSAL AND PROVIDE CAPITALIST. YEAH AND IT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR STATE PLAN ON AGING. OF THE GOAL WE HAVE A GOOD GOAL. SAYING THAT WE WISH TO PROVIDE OLDER CALIFORNIANS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES SENATOR THAT GOAL. IS TO SUPPORT OLDER ADULTS INCREASING THEIR ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOOD. OKAY I I WON'T COMMENT ON IT YET UNTIL WE FINISH WITH THE REST OF THE SPEAKERS THEM -- LOUISE BOURGEOIS. YES -- DEMONSTRATION NOT TAKING A POSITION AT THIS TIME I ALSO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSALS WOULD BE GREAT TO GET MORE INFORMATION AND TO THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO PURSUE PRIORITIZE PROPOSAL WE CAN WE'RE COLLABORATIVE WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE [inaudible] HELLO. I'M WE WOULD ALSO OFFER ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT MEMBERS AND STAFF WOULD REQUIRE ALL RIGHT. MS RUBIO THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR FOR THE ASKING I KNOW IT'S A IT'S HEARTBREAKING FOR ME AS WELL TO SEE THAT THAT YOU WE HAVE TO KEEP COMING BACK AND COMING BACK AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT SOME POINT FOR US TO FIND AS WE DID SOME WORK. A COUPLE YEAR ACTUALLY TWO YEARS AGO -- FOR A SITCOM SIMILAR PROGRAM IT'S CALLED ANGEL FOOD PROJECT AND IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM THAT. IS HAPPENING IN OF MULTIPLE COUNTIES BUT THE ONE ANGEL FOOD PROJECT IS SPECIFICALLY AND LA COUNTY. AND I VISITED AND I'VE ACTUALLY DELIVERED FOOD FOR THEM BUT SO THAT THE I PROMISE OF THE PROGRAM IS THE FOLLOWING -- CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. OF FOLKS. THAT ARE RECEIVING NUTRITIOUS MEALS AND OF DIE. THE I. WHAT IS IT CALLED THAT APPROPRIATE UP MEALS FOR WHATEVER AILMENT THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD IT'S A THE PILOT PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AND SO WERE WERE FOLLOWING FOLKS THAT -- ARE YOU RECEIVING THE MEALS AND OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE NOT AND WE'RE TRYING. TO MAKE THAT CORRELATION ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE SAVE UP BY FEEDING THESE FOLKS AND MY LONG TERM GOAL AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A PIE IN THE SKY TYPE OF GOAL IS THAT. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT -- NUTRITION IS MEDICATION SO THAT DOCTORS ARE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE NUTRITIOUS FOOD. AS PART OF A A RECOVERY -- PROGRAM AND I THINK. IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT FOOD AS MEDICATION THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE THESE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOW AND HOPEFULLY. AGAIN PLAN THIS GUY A TYPE OF THINKING BUT IF DOCTORS WERE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE AND WE WOULD SPEND THE MONEY ON FOOD THAT WE DO ONE MEDICATION I THINK THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE COULD -- ALL GET AROUND -- OR SUPPORT -- I THINK WE ALL SEE THAT WE SUPPORTED BUT IF WE DON'T SEE ANY DATA -- TO WE HAVE THE DATA BUT IF WE DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE OUR BUDGET FOLKS LOOK AT IT AS A LINE ITEM ISSUE AS OPPOSED TO A YOU KNOW FEEL GOOD ISSUE. BOB WE'RE NOT GOING TO EVER -- CONTINUE THE FUNDING WITHOUT HAVING TO CUT IT AND YOU KNOW AND THE DON DOWNTURN. ECONOMIC TIMES BUT ANYWAY SO I DID SOME FOOD DELIVERY AND JUST TO SEE THE REACTION FROM THE FOLKS THAT ARE BEING -- VISITED. YOU KNOW ONE COMPONENT IS THE FOOD BUT THE ACTUAL HUMAN CONTACT. ESPECIALLY FOR THE THE ELDERLY POPULATION IS JUST AS CRITICAL AS THE NUTRITION THAT THE RECEIVING AND SAW IT. I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO THE CHOIR BUT THE THESE PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL BUT I THINK IN THE LONG TERM. A YOU KNOW BUDGETARY -- LOOK IS THERE GOING TO SAVE US MONEY BY PROVIDING -- THESE PROGRAMS AND THE AND THE FOOD TO TO THE ELDERLY BECAUSE IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE FALLING OR NOT BEING RESCUED WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUY A HOUSE THEM AND THEN -- RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO COST MUCH MORE SO I HOPE BUT THAT THAT AT SOME POINT WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE AS PREVENTION. OF PREVENTATIVE OF MEASURES SO THAT WEEK IF WE LOOK AT IT IS THAT BUDGETARY ISSUE WE'RE SAVING MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. AND SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND MAKE THESE. ONGOING FUNDING NOD ONE TIME AND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING BACK EVERY SINGLE TIME BECAUSE FOR US IF WE LOOK AT LINE ITEMS. IT'S ONE THING BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED. WHEN WE DO THESE BUDGET CUTS IT'S IT'S IT'S HUMBLING YOU'RE RIGHT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO BE THERE ONE DAY? AND THE SILVER TSUNAMI THAT WE ARE ALL PART OF WAITING FOR IS I THINK IT'S HERE. I THINK IT'S HERE AND KEEP WE KEEP REFERRING TO IT AS IT'S GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE IT'S ALREADY HERE. AND SOUL YES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED BUT I THINK IT'S WE NEED MUCH MORE THAN THAT WE NEED SOME FORWARD THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THESE MEASURES -- A A MEDICARE A A PRESCRIPTION. OR SOME TYPE OF OF OF PROGRAM THAT IS PAID FOR ALREADY WITHOUT HAVING TO DO A SEPARATE BUDGET ASK SOUL SO YES THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANT IS NEEDED BUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS PART OF A I DON'T KNOW MEDI CAL. OF PRESCRIPTION METHOD OR IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST ALL. YEAH THE HELP ME HELP US DO THIS BECAUSE IF I THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE AND JUST TO TO HEAR THE TRAGIC STORIES. ABOUT WHAT YOU ALL SEE OUT THERE IS HEART BREAKING AND AT SOME POINT. WE CAN YOU KNOW JUST ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE -- LIKE THE LIKE THIS WITHOUT EATING DOG FOOD OR NOT EATING AT ALL SO ANYWAY IT'S KIND OF MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT THE OR IT IS A QUESTION HOW CAN YOU HELP US. MAKE THIS A PRIORITY OR A PREVENTATIVE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING BACK -- AND ASKING FOR THIS MONEY AND SO IF WE CAN ALL PUT OUR YOU KNOW THINKING HATS AND YOU KNOW BUDGETARY HATS TOGETHER -- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AN EAR WITH THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE THAT AN ISSUE THAT IS PART OF THIS ONGOING -- PREVENTION. OF METHODS THAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR TO HELP THE SENIOR POPULATION BUT I THINK YOU KNOW ALL OF THE POPULATIONS OF WE CAN GET. FOOD AS A PRESCRIPTION I THINK THAT WOULD HELP NOT JUST THE ELDERLY POPULATION BUT ALL OF OUR POPULATIONS AND I WON'T GET INTO THE WHOLE DIABETES ISSUE BUT THAT WOULD BE FOR ANOTHER CONVERSATION BUT I THINK IF WE THOUGHT OF FOOD AS AS PREVENTION AND HIS MEDICATION AND THAT. WE WE WOULD BE ALL HAPPY TO SUPPORT. EVERYBODY CELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS RUBIO IT THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE'RE THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION. ALASKA NOW ALLOWS DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE HOUSING. SO IF HOUSING IF THE DOCTOR COULD BRING OUT HIS HIS -- PRESCRIPTION PAD AND SAY THIS PERSON NEEDS HOUSING THAN ABSOLUTELY THE EVEN TO A GREATER DEGREE THEY NEED TO HAVE FOOD THEY NEED TO TUITION. SO THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE. TO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO I KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO SAY I DO BECAUSE I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHAT BOTH OF YOU ARE SAYING AND JUST ONE SUGGESTED AROUND THAT IS TO LOOK AT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS WHICH WOULD ALLOW. MEDICAID DOLLARS TO BE USED FOR NON MEDICAL. CARE AND THAT WOULD BRING IN FEDERAL DOLLARS TO IT WOULDN'T BE STATE FUNDING SO IF WE COULD LOOK AT THAT AND OUR NEXT WAIVER PROCESS WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW. THAT COULD BE A REAL CREATIVE SOLUTION THAT HELPS ALL OF US AND YOU KNOW TO ME FOOD AND HOUSING YOU BOTH SAID IT THOSE ARE SO CRITICAL HELP. THAT WOULD FIT IN AND ON BOTH SIDES WE CAN GET SOME DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE COST BENEFIT OF DOING THAT SO I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH. THE COMMITTEE EITHER ONE OF YOU ON ON IN THE INVEST. INVESTIGATING THAT A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. I WOULD SAY ALL THREE OF US SAY THAT -- YEAH YOU WERE BEHIND. IT'S THE YOU KNOW WAS REMARKABLE IS THE ABILITY IN THIS PROGRAM TO KEEP THE COST OF SELL LOW ALREADY ALEX. THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'M I MEAN I'M SAID HERE AND I'M GOING. IN A WALMART DELIVERS AT HOME NOW UBER EATS ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND AND AND I'M GOING OKAY. IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE YOU KNOW YOU GET YOU GET CLICK A BUTTON ON A TABLET FOOD SHOWS A BIGGER TOWARD IT'S IT'S CRAZY BUT THE IT BLOWS MY MIND I IN I A SAID ON AS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD NOW [inaudible] IT YEAH. I'M SITTING HERE GOING. HOW THE HELL? WE BRAG ABOUT BEING THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT BECAUSE WE HEAR THAT ALL BUT HI. AND WE HEAR ABOUT A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS. AND WE'RE STARVING OUR SENIORS. IT'S A SHAME. AND I KNOW LAST YEAR IN AND MEMBER RUBIO AND I SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. AND WE PUSHED THE SAME ISSUE AND THE FUNDING. AND TO HAVE A JOB LOST WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND ALL THESE OTHER MARKET MEASURES THAT THE DRIVE UP THE COST OF FOOD AND PRODUCTION EVERYTHING ELSE ON US. TO WE WE HAD ALL THIS SET. THE ASSEMBLY THE ASSEMBLY ALL THE LEGISLATORS AGREED AND IT GOT IN INTO THE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WERE OR GET TO WHAT THEY CALL THE THREE WAY DEAL WHERE WE'RE NOW THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY ARE. DEBATING WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND WE LOST. SO WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR NOW. SO HOPEFULLY HE'LL Là. BE WILLING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES MORE AND OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THE THE DIRECTOR KNOWS AS WELL THESE ISSUES ARE BEING LOOKED A LOT BETTER -- SO I THINK WE HAVE -- A LOT BETTER CHANCES THIS YEAR. ON MODE AFFORD AND I KNOW -- MEMBER RUBIO IS WORKING ON HER BILL WHICH HE LOT OF BROTHER NOW AND SHARE YOUR IDEAS GIRL. BUT WE WE CAN DO THESE THINGS. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THESE THINGS -- THAT IN YOUR SUGGESTED OF LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS WHEN WE COME UP IN A YEAR FROM NOW ON THOSE ISSUES IS REALLY GOOD AS WELL [inaudible] I'M JUST. SERIOUSLY AND I'M ON THE VERGE OF THE FOURTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND IN WE'RE LISTENING. TWO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OUR SENIORS EATING [inaudible] DOG FOOD. NOT OKAY WITH THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT A FICTION AND GAVIN HOPEFULLY YOU'RE LISTENING OR YOUR PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION. YOU KNOW I I THOUGHT THAT GOVERNMENT ONLY DOG FOOD SHE NEEDS REAL FOOD SO LET'S GET THIS FIXED. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FINANCE -- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE BUILD A CREDIBLE ESTIMATE? ON SENIOR NUTRITION. WELL I HAVE TO DEFER DEPARTMENT ON WHAT DATA WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ANY SPECIFIC NUTRITION ESTIMATE -- I CAN WORK FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE DEMOGRAPHICS UNIT WITHIN FINANCE TO SEE WHAT DATA WE HAVE. I'M JUST NOT FAMILIAR RIGHT NOW WITH KIND OF HOW TO BUILD. ONE WELL THERE'S SOME TALK ABOUT THE WAITING LIST. DO WE HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON WHAT THIS WAITING LIST IS. THE AMOUNT ON THE WAITING LIST. NOT ALL TRIPLE A.'S ARE FOR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING A RECALL. AGENCIES ON AGING AND THEIR PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP WAITING LISTS. SOME DO. SOME DON'T SO THE INFORMATION THE ONE WITH HALF AROUND WAITING LISTS WOULD. VERY ACROSS SYRIA AS AN PROVIDERS SO YOU COULD HAVE PARTIAL INFORMATION. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF WHAT OF WAITING LISTS LOOK LIKE ACROSS THE STATE. YOU'D YOU'D BE ASKING DOES PROVIDERS AND AREA AGENCIES TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION TO SHARE ABOUT BUT IT'S NOT. A REQUIREMENT ACROSS THE PROGRAM. DO THE LOCAL PLANS GIVE US THAT INFORMATION. OF THE LOW. WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL PLAN SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOT. IT'S CERTAINLY CONCEIVABLE THAT CERTAIN PLANS WOULD CERTAIN PLANS MAY NOT IT AGAIN. WAITING LIST INFORMATION MAY OR MAY NOT SHOW UP IN A AN AREA PLAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT REQUIRED INFORMATION. SHOULD BE REQUIRED. I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE. THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION TASK WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT RESOURCES FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE. STRUGGLING. I THINK THE ANSWERS YOU ARE ALL OF STRUGGLING THEM WELL NO BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS. THERE IT BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT ENABLING PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. WITHOUT ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BURDENSOME TO THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE THE FUNDING TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS SO IT THE ANSWER SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS CITIZENS MATHIS SORRY SO SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF YOU'RE ASKING PROVIDERS TO KEEP WAITING LISTS. PROVIDERS WOULD. IT SHOULD BE READ IT SHOULD BE RESOURCE TO DO THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW MANY OF OUR SENIORS ARE NOT RECEIVING THE NUTRITION. HOW DO WE COME UP WITH A NUMBER HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THAT ESTIMATE? I SO [inaudible] ONE IT'S NOT AN EASY ANSWER. OF BECAUSE NUTRITION SO UNDER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PEOPLE WHO WORSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES. OUR SIXTY AND OLDER. THEY MAY BE LOW INCOME THEY MAY NOT BE. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF SERVICES THAT A FACT [inaudible] NUTRITION [inaudible] OF THE HOME DELIVERED MEALS AND CONGREGATE MEALS. ADDRESS NUTRITIONAL NEEDS SO DO COMMODITIES PROGRAMS BROWN BAG PROGRAMS. OF ACCESS. TO TWO OF THE PLACES TO GET GROCERIES IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE L. WHO. SOLD ME SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE IS THERE IS NOT A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU GET THAT. NEED THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE [inaudible] IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING OFFICE DID THE STOCK TRY TO GET OUT UNMET NEED. IN OLDER AMERICANS ACT NUTRITION PROGRAMS. WHAT THEY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT? THE DATA FROM THE CURRENT POPULATION STUDY. AND THEY'VE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND AMONG LOW INCOME ADULTS. WHAT WERE THEY RECEIVING? WITH REGARDS TO SERVICES THAT WERE SIMILAR. TO OLDER AMERICANS ACT TITLE. THREE NUTRITION SERVICES. OF WHAT THEY FOUND A THEIR THEIR DATA FOCUSED ON ADULTS SIXTY AND OLDER LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOME. IT'S THAT WERE BELOW A HUNDRED AND 85% OF POVERTY. SO THEY COULDN'T BE GENERALIZED TO THE POPULATION OF PERSONS WHO MIGHT HAVE. A LITTLE MORE RESOURCES. AND WHAT THEY FOUND THAT THEY CAME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE THAT DID NOT RECEIVE MEAL SERVICES LIKE THOSE FUNDED. BY TITLE THREE PROGRAMS. AND ABOUT 83% DID NOT RECEIVE MEALS AMONG -- 83% OF OLDER ADULTS WHO WERE FOOD IN SECURE WERE. AS MEASURED BY SUCH THINGS AS OF WORRYING ABOUT FOOD. SKIPPING MEALS BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD. OR NOT EATING FOR A WHOLE DAY BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD. WE'RE NOT RECEIVING. SERVICES SO GIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU. OKAY I I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION BUT I WOULD LIKE -- MISTER MATHIS HAS A QUICK. QUESTION HE WANTS TO ASK PLEASE MR MATHIS OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M LISTEN THIS CONVERSATION AND AND AND THAT I'M NOT LIKE IN ANY OF THE ANSWERS BECAUSE IT'S WE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT I I GOT A FOREIGN EXCHANGE UNITS IN HIGH SCHOOL I KNOW. HE NEEDS. TEN DOLLARS A DAY FOR LAUNCH. IT'S FIVE DAYS A WEEK THAT FIFTY BUCKS A WEEK THE THESE ARE SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS OF MY NINE YEARS OLDS COULD FIGURE OUT. SO I'M VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT AND THE FACT THAT IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WE FIGURED OUT FREE AND REDUCED BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS REGARDLESS. OF THEIR INCOME BRACKETS. MAYBE TALKING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. TO FIGURE SOME OF THIS OUT -- THEN YOU GUYS THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE. AND I THINK ALL MEMBERS ARE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND I THINK THE PUBLIC EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THIS. BUT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH IN OUR SCHOOLS. WE WE ALREADY HAVE DEPARTMENTS DOING THIS TALK TO EACH OTHER. PLEASE WELL. I I WILL SAY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. HAS WITHIN THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF FOOD IN SECURITY THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND CAL FRESH OUT REACH. WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING TO WORK ON SS I CASH OUT -- WE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF FOOD IN SECURITY FOR AWHILE. ALL I'M SAYING IS GETTING OUT AN EXACT PERCENTAGE OF UNMET NEED. IN IN MY OPINION PERHAPS THAT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT IS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE'S NEED. BUT I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT MONEY. WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NEED RIGHT. ARE WE ALL KNOW IT. AND I A SHE EIGHT MR MATHIS'S COMMENT. WE REALLY DO NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE MONEY FOR GOING TO BUDGET THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. IT'S THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN. HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED. FOR TEN YEARS. OR MORE AND IN ORDER FOR US TO IF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING SAYS WE HAVE AN UNMET NEED. WE WE WE HAVE SENIORS WHO ARE NOT RECEIVING THE THE MEALS THAT THEY SHOULD. WE ALL AGREE. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE CORE TO START FIGURING OUT WHAT THE UNMET NEED IS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. AND YOU HAVE TO TELL US YOU NEED TO BE OUR THOUGHT PARTNERS IN THIS THINK THIS THROUGH. YOU KNOW WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SAYS OKAY LET'S THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF THIS IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE. SO SHE HAS THOUGHT OUTSIDE THE BOX ABOUT SOME AWAY THAT WE MIGHT BE. AS SHE SAID MAYBE PART OF THE SKY. SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DREAM BIG WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OUTSIDE OF THE BOX HOW WE TAKE CARE OF THIS. WE REALLY DO LOOK TO YOU TO TO TELL US WHAT IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING NEEDS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GUESS. BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO THE PUBLIC AND WE KNOW THERE'S A NEED WE'RE LOOKING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE KNOW THERE'S A NEED. WE'RE LOOKING TO YOU TO HELP US BUILD GOOD NUMBERS SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO. BECAUSE THIS IS A PERSISTENT NEED MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM MS MILLER PLEASE. THANK YOU WE ABSOLUTELY CONCUR THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER COORDINATION COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION ACROSS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND THAT HOW DO WE DO IT IS. THAT OUR GOVERNOR'S VISION FROM ASPEN WILL FIGURE IT OUT CAMINO I WORK TOGETHER AND I I REALIZE YOU'RE NEW. AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS. NOT AN UNFAIR BURDEN BECAUSE YOU TOOK IT ON AND I KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE I'VE READ ABOUT YOU YOU YOU HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH STATE. AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO GREAT THINGS. I WANT YOU TO NOTE JUST HOW HOW HOW URGENT TO THIS NEED IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER YEAR. TO THINK THIS THROUGH AND TO THINK WELL HOW WE GOING TO DO THIS. IT IS TAKING AS PERHAPS MISTER FRAZIER WOULD SAY TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND SAYING OKAY. WE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THIS HOW WE GONNA DO IT WE'RE DOING IT NOW. AND BRINGING THE STAKEHOLDERS BRINGING WHOEVER IT IS YOU NEED TO BRING IN -- IN FACT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ASK. FOR A I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REPORT [inaudible] TO US. BEFORE THE MAY REVISE. AND IF NOT A REPORT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR EXACT NUMBERS I DO WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR. I THINK IF YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT ANYBODY HERE ON THE DíAS WAS ASKING FOR AN EXACT NUMBER I WANT. TO I WANT YOU TO KNOW. NOBODY IS ASKING FOR AN EXACT NUMBER. BUT WE DO NEED THE BEST ESTIMATES WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BASED ON BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A NEW REQUEST -- THE THIS ISN'T TO WE KNOW THAT THE THE FUNDING WAS REDUCED THIS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT. SO IT'S BEEN REDUCED NOW WE NEED TO BRING IT UP TO WHAT IT WAS. WHY DO WE NEED TO BRING IT UP TO WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF SENIORS THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE? BASED UPON THIS FORMULA THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF OF SENIORS THAT HELP IN OUR THAT ARE NOT TO BE. RECEIVING THEIR NUTRITION. MR MATHIS TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENTISTS SCIENCE SCIENCE. WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S NOT. WE NEED YOUR HELP WE NEED FOR YOU TO BE OUR PARTNERS IN THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEED IS. SO THAT WE'RE NOT COMING UP WITH THE NUMBERED SAYING OKAY WE SAY FIVE MILLION. WHAT WE WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING THAT NUMBER FROM? WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT IT'S BASED ON WE WANT TO GET THERE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT'S BASED ON I WOULD DO DEPEND.

I DO WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO ASSIST US WITH UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE NEEDS ARE FOR THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS. MEALS ON WHEELS. AND CONGREGATE IN NUTRITION. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO CONSULT WITH THE ADVOCATES. WITH MISTER CAMP. DARRYL KELCH. AND GET THE MOST BURKE. TO SURVEY THE PROGRAM SITES IN THE CELLS WITH THEIR ANNUAL ON AVERAGE WAITING LISTS LOOK LIKE. IN THE FAIREST WAY POSSIBLE. AND THEN DEVELOP A GENERAL FUND ESTIMATE FROM THAT. THIS SHOULD GIVE US A REALISTIC PICTURE OF WHAT THE CURRENT. DOCUMENTED NUTRITIONAL NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM IS. AND IT WILL HELP US TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS PROPOSAL. IF AS YOU'RE DOING THIS YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. TO REACH OUT TO US. AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOUR BETTER METHOD IS. CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO THIS SURVEY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. TO THIS COMMITTEE. I MEAN WHAT I CAN I CAN LOOK TO SEE WHAT HOW I JUST CAN'T COMMIT RIGHT NOW IT'S GIVEN THE WORKLOAD BUT I AM DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE ADVOCATES AND SEE HOW WE CAN DO THIS.

GARY PASSED MORE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS I DON'T THINK IN IN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF SITTING THROUGH THESE HEARINGS I'VE EVER HEARD A DISCUSSION QUITE LIKE THIS. AND ON AND I THINK IN FAIRNESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING STAFF. YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THOSE EIGHTEEN YEARS AND MAYBE LONGER. ANY TIME THEY CAME IN AND ASKED FOR AN EXPANSION THEY WERE TURNED DOWN AND THEY WERE DISCOURAGED FROM THEIR UPPER. UP MANAGERS NOT TO GO IN AND KEEP ASKING AN EMBARRASSING THE ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT FUNDING IT THAT'S THE REALITY. WE HAVE LIVED IN A WORLD FOR A FOR A GENERATION AND WHICH ASKING WHAT WAS NEEDED. WAS DISCOURAGED AND AND SO OUR SYSTEM. IS IS DESIGNED NOT TO GENERATE THE KIND OF DATA THAT YOU NEED. UP IN RESPONSE TO UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER [inaudible] ROSA. RUBIO I'M SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME. OUT THERE ARE STATES THAT ARE DOING WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR THINKING ABOUT AT LEAST. A NUMBER OF STATES ARE LOOKING AT THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND BUILDING IN NUTRITION AS A COMPONENT OF THE CARE GIVEN AND MANAGE CARE. AND IN FACT THREE YEARS AGO WE DO WE STARTED WORKING ON THAT AND WE'RE JUST BEATEN DOWN I MEAN WE WERE TOLD DON'T EVEN GO THERE DON'T EVEN MENTION IT BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE TOO GREAT. BUT IT IS A CROCK ACOSTA AVOIDANCE AS WELL. BY HAVING HEALTHY. UP MEMBERS OF A OF A MEDICARE PLAN OR MEDICAL PLAN BUT AT ANY RATE I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT. I'VE DREAMED ABOUT THIS DAY AND WE WILL BE AN AVAILABLE. TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP NUMBERS I WOULD SAY THE PLACE TO START IS THE MILLION. SENIORS BETWEEN THAT NUMBER A DONE TO FIGHT AS OF BEING AT RISK OF BEING FOOD INSUFFICIENT. AND THE NUMBER THAT WERE ACTUALLY SERVING IN THAT DIFFERENCES ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE SO IF YOU START WITH THE MILLION AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT COSTS TO DEAL. WITH ONE INDIVIDUAL FOR THE MEALS THAT THAT WE DO FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING AND MULTIPLY IT TIMES A MILLION THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY IN THE BALLPARK AND NOT I KNOW IS A VERY. UP. ROUGH WAY OF DOING IT BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU I'M NOT VERY FAR OFF [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI BUT I THAT IT WOULD YOUR COMMENTS. NOT. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENTS. AND I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHATEVER THEY REQUEST THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE.

AND SO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS TO THEM LIKE IN PLAIN TALK BECAUSE THEY REALLY YOU KNOW HONESTLY IS BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET IT IS JUST THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW THEY WANT TO BE USING THEIR BAND WITH. JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE THE BILL NUMBERS IN THE FANCY TALK THAT WE ALL DO WHEN WE COME AND TALK UP HERE. AND OF MISS CUTTING HIM AS ONE OF OUR ADVOCATES -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AS THEY THINK ABOUT HOW ALL OF THIS IS ALL PART OF THEIR ECOSYSTEM. THEY DON'T JUST SHOW UP FOR MIL. THEY'RE NOT JUST INTERESTED IN TRANSPORTATION THEY DON'T JUST NEED US ALL TO SERVICE SUPPORT SERVICES THEY DON'T JUST NEED LEGAL SUPPORT. OR OR EVEN THE PROTECTION WHEN IT COMES TO THEM -- IN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE THEY ACTUALLY NEED ALL OF THIS AND SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE A DAY LIKE TODAY WHERE IT'S IT'S A RAINY DAY. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE A UMBRELLA AND THESE SERVICES ARE PART OF THEIR UMBRAL. BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO GET UNDER THE UMBRELLA. SO BY NOT FUNDING THE ALL THE PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY LEAVING PEOPLE OUT IN THE RAIN AND I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE THAT METAPHOR WITH YOU AND HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATOR JOHN PORTER CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE -- AS A CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF LAGUNA MIGUEL AND ALSO ORANGE COUNTY HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND. WHAT THE CONGREGATE MEAL AND ME ALONG WHEELS PROGRAMS CAN HAVE AS AN IMPACT ON SENIORS HEALTH AND NUTRITION GO HAND IN HAND? I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS. FOR PROVIDING US LOTS OF INFORMATION AND INDULGING US AS WE TRY TO WORK TOGETHER. TO PARTNER TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. I MOST ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KANSEN CHU FOR CHAMPIONING THIS AND FOR PROVIDING. THE VERY -- DETAILED BUDGET REQUEST -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING THAT PRESENTATION TO US TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE NEXT PANELISTS. THE NEXT PANEL IS MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. AND BEFORE WE GET WOULD BEGIN TESTIMONY ON ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO SHE IS ON ISSUE NUMBER. SIX AND I WANT TO BE SURE WE HEAR HER TESTIMONY. JUST IN CASE IT DOESN'T MAKE IT BACK SO. SO -- I MS RUBIO WOULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY ON ISSUE NUMBER. SIX YOU CAN DO IT FROM THERE. THANK YOU -- YES SO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATE SURE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST CONTINUES APPROPRIATION OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO KEEP THE C. S. L. OPERATIVE -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ALREADY KNOW THIS YES I WAS INITIALLY FOUNDED. BY FORMER STATE SENATOR HENRY MELLOW QUINN NINETEEN EIGHTY CONVENE THE FIRST SILVER HAIRED LEGISLATURE. OUT SINCE THEN THE CSL HAS CONTINUED TO SERVE AS A CRITICAL RESOURCE TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND PRIORITIES OF THE AGING COMMUNITY. IN FACT THROUGH CS CELLS EFFORTS OVER TWO HUNDRED BILLS THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CALIFORNIA SENIORS HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW. THE CSL EXISTS UNDER THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND LIKE EVERY ENTITY HAS SIGNIFICANT COST ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OPERATION. TO DATE THE CSO HAS BEEN FUNDED IN PART BY GENERAL FUND ALLOCATIONS AND BY THE INCOME TAX CHECK OFF PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE DECREASING DONATIONS MADE TO THE TAX CHECK OFF PROGRAM AND INCREASING OPERATION EXPENSES THE FUTURE OF DSL IS IN JEOPARDY. THE SI SL HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO REMAIN SOLVENT. AS A RESULT THE CSO HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OVERHEAD COSTS REDUCE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANNUAL SESSION AND WORK TO FIND A HOME. UNDER DIFFERENCE THE DEPARTMENTS. WHILE REDUCTIONS IN OVERHEAD COSTS HAVE HELPED THE CSL REQUEST TO BE HOUSED UNDER THERE WAS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. TO FACILITATE THE SUCCESS OF THIS REQUEST I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO FURTHER IMPROVE FUEL CELLS BUDGET ESTIMATES AND CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO CODIFY CONTINUAL GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT CSL PERSONNEL. AN OPERATING AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSES. TO BE QUITE FRANK THE SEE ALSO THE C. S. L. IS IN DIRE FINANCIAL SITUATION. GIVEN THEY AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CSL AND THE ORGANIZATIONS UNIQUE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY INFORM MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. ON KEY ISSUES OF OUR STATES GROWING SENIOR POPULATION I'VE I BELIEVE THIS SMALLER PREPARATION IS NECESSARY WORTHY AND JUSTIFIED. I'M. LATER YOU WILL HEAR FROM -- JOHN POINTERS SEE ALSO OF REPRESENTATIVE BY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL -- AND THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL I GUESS WE IT'S ALL. INTERTWINED WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THE SENIORS DIRECTLY I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE. A LEGISLATORS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THEIR INSIGHT ON WHAT. WE NEED. IS CRITICAL AND THEIR CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS I'VE EVEN SUGGESTED I THOUGHT OUTSIDE THE BOX I SUGGESTED TO SEE A CELL TO REQUEST THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MEMBER -- AS A DONATION -- TO TO THEIR PROGRAM I FIGURED YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TIMES THREE YOU KNOW WHERE I'M TRYING TO DO MATH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE. IF THE THE THE ARM ARE OUT BUDGET OF THE GENERAL FUND CAN'T. AND SO I'VE EVEN IN -- SUGGESTED THAT YOU KNOW FUNDRAISING OPPORTUNITIES BUT IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY FIX I CAN DONATE MY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND DO SOME FUNDRAISING FOR THEM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT. AS OUR AGING POPULATION INCREASES THEIR HELP IS IS ARE MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PROVIDING THE LEGISLATORS. ARE THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED WE CAN'T BE AT ALL PLACES AND THESE HEARINGS UNFORTUNATELY ONLY HAPPENED A FEW TIMES A YEAR. BASIS IS NEEDED AND WE NEED TO FIND THEM HOME AND WE NEED TO FIND THAT -- ALLOCATION SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE CONSIDER THAT BUDGET ALLOCATION AND WE THOUGHT OF WAYS AND IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HOUSE THEM. OUT WHERE WE CAN HELP THEM AND IF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IS TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE HELP US FIGURE THIS OUT -- AGAIN -- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM FROM CSL JUMP POINT OR WILL BE -- DISCUSSING AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO DO THIS -- EARLIER THAN -- AN ISSUE. SIX THANK YOU MS REPEAL WILL. IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE HEAR FROM YOU SO I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT WE HEARD FROM YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TAKE YOU OUT OF TURN ALL RIGHT. AS YOU WILL RECALL BEFORE DOCTOR WOULD LEFT HE DID GIVE HIS TESTIMONY. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS HE TALKED ABOUT IS THE FACT THERE'D BEEN NO AUGMENTATION FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS HE TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS THE ONE THING. THAT I PUT AN ASTERISK NEXT. TO ALL RIGHT SO -- LET'S BEGIN WITH JANET HE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE THIRTY EIGHT EMESIS P. PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A ONE TIME ONLY SUPPLEMENTAL INCREASE OF TWENTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IN GENERAL FUND. TO BE DISTRIBUTED OVER THREE YEARS. AS YOU KNOW AND ARE WELL AWARE OF THE SENIOR POPULATION IS GROWING RAPIDLY. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORTED ON DISABILITIES AMONG SENIORS AND THEY PREDICTED. THAT OLDER CALIFORNIA'S TURNING SIXTY FIVE BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WILL LIVE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE POINT SIX YEARS -- BEYOND. SIXTY FIVE AND WILL EXPERIENCE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS WITH A DISABILITY. IN A SURVEY THAT WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED AMONG THE EMESIS P. SITES WE FOUND THAT OUR AVERAGE CLIENT IS ON FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. AND THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE WE HAVE CLIENTS ON FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS SOMETIMES. WE DO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR A VERY LONG TIME FOR THESE PEOPLE. WE WERE WILLING TO HELP WITH THIS AGING DILEMMA THAT WE'RE FACING AND THE WIND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE DO THAT IS PROVIDING IN COORDINATING SERVICES. FOR SENIORS ON MEDICARE ALL WHO HAVE PHYSICAL AND OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS WHO ARE LIVING AT HOME. WE PREVENT AND DELAY NURSING HOME PLACEMENT BY USING COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS I HSS. ANSWERED MEALS ON WHEELS. OR ADULT DAYCARE. AND WE OFFER PROFESSIONAL STAFF THAT CONSIST OF REGISTERED NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS WHO EVALUATE THE BENEFICIARY'S NEEDS AND HELP THEM ACCESS A NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES. THAT INCLUDE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS AND ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT IMPACT ONCE HELL. THE SUPPLEMENTAL INCREASE THAT WE'RE REQUESTING WOULD BE SPREAD OVER THREE YEARS. A FIRST YEAR 25% INCREASE IN THE BASE -- RATES -- WOULD MAKE UP FOR THE RATE OF INFLATION BETWEEN TWENTY AND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THAT WOULD BE A 25% INCREASE. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE EMPHASIS P. SITES TO REBUILD AND TO STABILIZE THE PROGRAMS THAT. HAVE NOT SEEN A RATE INCREASE AS YOU SAID FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND IN THAT THIRTEEN YEARS WE'VE ALSO EXPERT EXPERIENCE TO BUDGET CUTS TO TOTAL TWENTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. SO THESE BUDGET CUTS IMPOSED AN ONGOING STATEWIDE REDUCTION OF LOTS. SO WE ARE DOWN FROM WHERE WE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE SPENDING PROPOSAL RESTORE 50% OF THOSE SLOTS IN YOUR TO AND THE OTHER 50% IN YOUR THREE BRING CALIFORNIA BACK TO PRE RECESSION CAPACITY OF ELEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE SLOTS. KEEP IN MIND THAT WE THAT IS NOT A ONE FOR ONE THAT WE OFTEN HAVE CLIENTS THAT REVOLVE OFF THE PROGRAM SO WE FIGURED THAT THAT'S LOOKING AT ALMOST. FOURTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE. IN THIS IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR WEIGHTLESS WHICH IS CURRENTLY AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED STATEWIDE. AND THAT'S WITHOUT HAVING ANY KIND OF AGGRESSIVE. RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND PROCESS AND AND JUST KIND OF LIVING PEOPLE BE REFERRED TO AS WE STILL HAVE FIFTEEN HUNDRED IF WE AGGRESSIVELY RECRUITED I'M SURE THAT WOULD DOUBLE VERY QUICKLY. SO -- THEY'RE WEIGHTLESS IF WE CAN REDUCE THAT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO DIVERT. AFFORDABLE NURSING HOME MISSION AND TO DE INSTITUTIONALIZE OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY FROM. THE NURSING HOME FACILITIES. OF I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT NURSING HOMES NOW CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA FOR SEMI PRIVATE ROOMS AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WITH THIS PROPOSAL -- OF INCREASING OUR BASIC RATES EMESIS P. WILL REMAIN A BARGAIN AT FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR -- WHICH IS MATCHED WITH FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS. AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] THANK YOU -- WE'VE GOT NEXT. FRAN MULLER. YES SPECIFIC COMMENTS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO PROTECT HIM STAFF. WONDERFUL JOE RODRIGUEZ. ED LONG. AGAIN THIS IS OF THE PROPOSAL THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL UNDER OUR STATE PLAN TO ENABLE OLDER CALIFORNIANS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS TO BE ACTIVE AND SUPPORTED. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND UNDER THAT GOAL THIS PROPOSAL IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OBJECTIVES. TO INTEGRATE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES INTO CAL MANY CONNECT. IMPLEMENTS HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE EMPHASIS P. PROGRAM. AND IN EMPLOYMENT NECESSARY OPERATIONAL CHANGES RELATED TO PERSONS CARE. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. BERMAN FINANCE HAVE NOTHING. HELLO HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WONDERFUL. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW ON THE DESIGN OF THIS ADVOCACY PROPOSAL? OVER YOUR ARE YOU MEAN THE SPECIFICS -- I DON'T HAVE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION OVER THREE YEARS. I SUPPOSE IT COULD'VE BEEN TEN MILLION PER YEAR ON GOING BUT I THINK HERE AGAIN TRYING TO BE CREATIVE GIVE US TWENTY FIVE MILLION WILL SPREAD IT OUT OVER THREE YEARS WE'LL COME BACK IN THREE YEARS AND TELL YOU WHAT WE DID AND WHAT WE NEED NOW I CAN SAY FROM THE WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL BUT I I WILL SAY THAT I DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE ONE TIME ONLY NATURE. YOU DID OR DID NOT DID. TWO ONE ELSE GETS. ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK I DO OKAY. VERY GOOD [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD LET'S TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. HI DENISE LAKER INDEPENDENCE HOMES CAN HEALTH PLAN I AM THE SITE DIRECTOR FOR MS US BE SITE NUMBER FIVE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL FIVE THAT BEGAN FORTY YEARS AGO IN THIS PROGRAM BEGAN AS A DEMONSTRATION. FORTY YEARS LATER WE ARE STILL ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. THIS IS A LIFELINE SERVICE WE ARE OFTEN THE SERVICE OF LAST RESORT FOR THE SENIORS. MOST OF THE SENIORS IN ON OUR PROGRAM ARE THE AVERAGE PROFILE IS FEMALE IN HER EIGHTIES ALONE WITH EITHER WIDOWED. OUTLIVE HER FAMILY MEMBERS. HAS MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS INABILITY TO TAKE CARE MEET HER BASIC NEEDS. A LOT OF THE TIME ALSO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING AND TRYING TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. ON MEDI CAL WITH NO SHARE OF COST WHICH MEANS THAT HER INCOME IS ONLY AND IN THE SIX SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR RANGE PER MONTH IF THAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE EVERYTHING HAPPEN ALONE IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I GET SERVICES THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE A ROBUST WAY THAT SOMEBODY CAN WALK IN THE DOOR. AND AT SENIOR CAN WALK IN THE DOOR AND BE ASSESSED AND BE EASILY LED TO THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AT HOME. AND SO THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM WHEN THEY COME TO US WE ARE THE JACK OF ALL TRADES WE ARE THE RESOURCE OF LAST RESORT PUT IT TOGETHER FOR THEM AND TRYING TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE THEM BE A THE GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO LIVE AT HOME AND BE SAFE. THERE'S NOBODY THAT WANTS TO MOVE INTO A NURSING HOME. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE INDEPENDENT AND AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE AND IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. AND SO THIS PROGRAM IS VITAL SURVIVAL LIFELINE AND WE REALLY NEED YOUR SUPPORT FOR FUNDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

IS ABLE TO DO. AND I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT FOR EVERY SENIOR YOU SEE ON THE STREET. THIS IS A VERY TARGETED POPULATION THAT FAILS USUAL CARE SOLUTIONS -- THEY CANNOT ADMINISTER ADD THEIR OWN IDEA TO SASS AND THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY TOLERATE BEING ON THE PHONE FOR AN HOUR. I'M TRYING TO APPEAL A DECISION THAT THAT AN ENTITY IS MADE OR I'M GET TO A PHYSICIAN VISITS THEMSELVES I'M EVEN WITH TRANSPORTATION THEY NEED ESCORTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS.
