IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE HI. THAT BILLS OUT BUT WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN THANK YOU. YEAH. I NEXT UP WE HAVE A CA FOURTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS MADAM CHAIR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS. THIS COMMITTEE HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY THIS YEAR AND IN PAST YEARS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ON THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE HAVE PASSED SIXTY FIVE BILLS OUT OF COMMITTEE JUST THIS YEAR AND ARE TAKING ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THESE VERY LONG COMMITTEE HEARING HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE PASSED LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE ACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE NEED FOR A LARGER WORK FORCE TO BUILD HOUSING. THIS MEASURE RESPONSE TO A DIFFERENT ISSUE. THE LACK OF ADEQUATE AN ONGOING FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE'S LACK OF SIGNIFICANT ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND IN OUR HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM HAS LED US TO THIS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS IS TO BUILD MORE UNITS. THE SPREAD OUT NATURE OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IS LEFT US IN NEED OF AT LEAST ONE MILLION NEW UNITS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE'S IN THE STATE INVESTED LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN CREATING A NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. AROUND THE SAME TIME WE WERE FORCED TO ELIMINATE REDEVELOPMENT WHICH GENERATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RELYING UPON VOTER APPROVED BONDS AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOCATIONS WILL NOT ALLOW US TO BUILD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ON THE SCALE THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THE CRISIS. THIS LACK OF INVESTMENT IS AN IS AN ADEQUATE THIS LACK OF INVESTMENT IN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS HAD A DIFFERENT IMPACT. ON OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INVESTED MORE RESPONSES THAN EVER BEFORE AND HOUSING OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WE HAVE A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER UP TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECADES AND DECADES OF UNDER INVESTMENT. ACA FOURTEEN THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE OR THE HOPE ACT AS RECALLING IT SETS ASIDE. 5% OF THE STATE'S BUDGET EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. PAY FOR HOMELESSNESS HOUSING AND SERVICES AND KERR AND CREATE NEW HOMEOWNERS. FOR PERSPECTIVE THIS YEAR'S REVENUE WAS TWO HUNDRED BILLION. WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT TEN MILLION FOR THE HOPE ACT. THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A TEN YEAR INVESTMENT STRATEGY WITH SPECIFIC METRICS AND MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENTS OF THIS ARE VERY CRITICAL SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- ARE VOTERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT IN THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY FIXING THIS PROBLEM. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD APPROVE EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. EVERY OCTOBER THE ADMINISTRATION WERE WOULD REPORT THE OUTCOMES OF THE HOPE BACK TO SHOW HOW MANY UNITS ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING HOUSE ETCETERA. IN OTHER WORDS THE DIRECT IMPACTS OF THESE DOLLARS. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL PROPOSITION FOR US HERE IN THE STATE AS WELL AS THE RAINY DAY FUND WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY FUNDING DIRECTED TO THE HOPE ACT OUT OF A HOUSING WORKING GROUP MANY OF YOU PARTICIPATED IN AROUND THIS PAST FALL. AND TOOK. MANY HOSTED EVENTS AND WENT TO DIFFERENT EVENTS AND WHERE WE DISCUSS THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. REPEATEDLY AT EACH STOP. AT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE STOP. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONSTITUENTS HOMELESSNESS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LAMENTED THE LACK OF FUNDING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS. THIS MEASURE IS BOLD. AND SOME MAY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF LOCKING IN FUNDING ON FUTURE BUDGET YEARS. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE AT THIS POINT TO TRULY ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS. FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. THE HOPE ACT REFLECTS WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO END HOMELESSNESS AND TO GIVE FAMILIES AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. IN ADDITION I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE 5% SET ASIDE IS A FLOOR AND NOT A CEILING. AND CREATE A TRIGGER TO TURN OFF THE ALLOCATION TO THE HOPE FUND IF THE STATE IS IN A DEEP RECESSION OR THE GOVERNOR DECLARES A MAN MADE OR NATURAL DISASTER. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY JOINING BY PHONE WILL BE WITH THE DENNIS. WHO WILL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SPEAK UP. AND IN PERSON. AND IN PERSON ROBERTO JIMENEZ CEO OF MUTUAL HOUSING. MISTER JIMENEZ GO HEAD. GOOD MORNING I'M A BAPTIST MINISTER YOUR MUTUAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WHETHER THE ZERO NET ENERGY AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN WOODLAND THE FIRST Z. ANY RENTAL HOUSING IN THE NATION OR LGBT WELCOMING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SACRAMENTO MITCHELL HOUSING IS DELIVERING HOUSING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE BE. IN THE POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. HAVE A STATE CALIFORNIA NOT ALLOCATED RESOURCES TO THESE TWO PROJECTS. THESE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT A BELT FIVE YEARS TO BUILD A HOUSING COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF DEDICATED FUNDING. DESPITE THE LEGISLATURE'S DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE A SHORTFALL OF OVER ONE MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR THE STATE'S LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. THE GOVERNOR AND LOGISTICS LEGISLATURE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS TIME AND AGAIN. IN RECENT YEARS BY USING BUDGET SURPLUSES. TO SUPPORT SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST EFFECTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS WITH MUCH NEEDED ONE TIME INVESTMENTS. ACA FOURTEEN WILL BUILD ON THESE EFFORTS AND PROVIDE A PERMANENT ON FOR ITS SOURCE OF FUNDING AT THE SCALE NEEDED TO CLOSE OUR STATE SHAMEFUL GAPS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY DEDICATING 5% OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO END HOMELESSNESS A BILL FOR A HOUSING ACA FOURTEEN WILL TRANSFORM OUR STATE'S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. CONSISTENT PREDICTABLE AVAILABILITY OF THESE FUNDING SOURCES AS CRITICAL FOR MUTUAL HOUSING IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS TO BE ABLE TO PLAN AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVER THIS DATA HOUSING TO CALIFORNIANS MORE QUICKLY. MUTUAL HOUSING IS READY AND PREPARED TO DELIVER OVER A THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOCAL MARKETS. LAND IS AVAILABLE BUT THE BECAUSE THE FINANCING IS SCARCE IT PROJECT COULD TAKE UP TO FIVE YEARS TO DELIVER. HOMELESSNESS M. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS TOO IMPORTANT.

I REMEMBER BEING SUICIDAL BECAUSE I NEVER FELT SO LOST RESPECT OTHER HOPELESSNESS. WITH NOTHING TO DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO AND NO SENSE OF SAFETY I FELT AFRAID CONSTANTLY AND BECOMING HOMELESS HOMELESS WAS MORE THAN I CAN HANDLE. I WAS IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS HOTELS REHAB SOBER LIVING PLACES YOU NAME IT. AFTER BEING HOSPITALIZED OR INSTITUTIONALIZED SEVEN TIMES TO DETOX OR BECAUSE OF ANOTHER SUICIDE ATTEMPT I LEARNED THAT MY DRINKING HELPED ME COPE WITH UNDIAGNOSED BIPOLAR DISORDER. IN TOTAL EXPERIENCE SEVEN CHAOTIC YEARS WITHOUT THE HOMELESSNESS. AT THE TIME IT TOOK BETWEEN WHEN I MOVED BACK HOME WHEN I RECEIVED MY MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. EVENTUALLY I FOUND THE RIGHT MEDICATION. AND RECEIVED SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. PERMANENT HOUSING HAS CREATED. FOR ME AND ALLOWED ME TO MAINTAIN UP. FOR A DECADE. I'VE BEEN LIVING IN MY CURRENT APARTMENT FOR SIX YEARS AND I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MANAGER. I NO LONGER WONDER WORLD SLEEP AT NIGHT.

I JUST WANNA THANK THE CHAIR FOR THIS BOLD INITIATIVE AND IT REALLY IS TELLING THAT WE DON'T DEDICATE MORE FUNDING THAT HISTORY MARGINAL FUNDING TO ON THE BOOKS CHRIS CRITICAL CRISES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA JUST OF COURSE HOUSING. TO REALLY COMMEND YOU FOR PUTTING THE FLOOR OF AT LEAST 5% OF FUNDING TOWARDS THE BUILDING AT. PRESERVATION FOR A HOUSING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REALLY IMPORTANT- YOU KNOW JUST AS WE HAD DONE S. C. A. TO JUST NOW TO UNDO THE PAST OF PREVENTING PUBLIC HOUSING AND PUBLICLY DEVELOPED HOUSING- I WE HAD A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS TOO BUT- I WANT TO ASK IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO AT LEAST INCLUDE THE MENTION OF SOCIAL HOUSING. I DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHICH WERE A DECADE FROM NOW AND ALL THE MONEY IS ONLY GOING TO PRIVATE. CORPORATIONS ARE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS ONLY WE ARE IN A SCENARIO WE NEED ALL SOLUTIONS ON THE TABLE AND SOCIAL HOUSING AS WE WORKED ON HIS NECK MESERVE ONE OF THEM I JUST DON'T WANT THERE TO BE EVER. A FUTURE SITUATION AND I'M ACTING OF PRECAUTION WHERE THEY INTERPRET IT AS A HOUSING IS NOT PART OF THIS I KNOW OBVIOUSLY BY THE MISSION OF WHAT'S ARE YOU GOING FOR THAT SOCIAL AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN IT BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN INCLUDE. THE MENTION OF IT JUST SO THAT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE FUTURE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE POSSIBLE TO DETERMINANTS SO- WHEN I APPRECIATE THE ADVOCACY ON SOCIAL HOUSING IN THE SOMEONE WHO'S I CHAIR THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL HOUSING AND HAVE COST THEIR PREVIOUS BILLS WITH YOU AND- SUPPORTED- YOUR SOCIAL THE BILL GETTING OUT OF COMMITTEES. THIS YEAR I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT- AND THE CREATIVITY AROUND NEW IDEAS TO TACKLE THE- HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ALL LIVE IN YOU KNOW THIS BILL- DOESN'T PRESCRIBE SPECIFICALLY HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE STATE WILL BE SPENT. I MEAN WE DID THAT WITH A LOT OF INTENTIONALITY AROUND CREATING FOR ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY- YOU KNOW WITH A BILL WE AND YOU KNOW I'M POWER AND REQUIRE A BCS AGE TO DEVELOP A TEN YEAR. FUNDING STRATEGY AS WE INCH MARKS AND I THINK THAT IS THE PLACE FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE AND HOW CAN THESE. FUNDS TO BE ALLOCATED AWAY THAT'S MOST EFFECTIVE THAT THAT GETS SORT OF. R. O. Y. ON THE INVESTMENT- AND SO- THOSE MATCH. I THINK OF TO BE COULD. AND I AS WE YOU KNOW IF YOUR BILLS TO MOVE FOR. AND YOU KNOW- BE SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW IF THAT BECOMES A MECHANISM BY WHICH THERE IS- SORT OF MONEY WELL SPENT ON THE ISSUE. I THINK THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN PLAY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STRATEGY- THAT IS DEVELOPED BY THE AGENCY. AND THEN REFLECTED IN THE METRICS AND SO I WANT TO PRESERVE FLEXIBILITY. FOR THAT TOO- FOR B. S. B. C. S. H. TO. BOTH CREATE THAT PLAN AS WELL AS PROVIDE THE- ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT SHOULD YOUR BILL COME INTO PLAY AND GET SIGNED INTO LAW. THERE'S A PLACE FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THAT. YEAH AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT ASKING FOR ANY CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OR MECHANISM TO BE PRESCRIBED AS OF HOUSING OR ANY OTHER MECHANISM IN THAT SENSE JUST TO MAKE SURE IT IN THE FUTURE WE'RE NOT. CONSTRAINED WHERE IT'S ONLY TO PRIVATE HOUSING ON PRIVATE ENTITIES ONLY. THAT'S MY BIG. CONCERN ABOUT THIS THIS THIS ISSUE. I'M THERE AGAIN NOT ASKING FOR SOME PROGRAMS LIKE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ASK FOR JUST THE MENTION OF SOCIAL HOUSING P. AS- IN IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR US TO CHANGE OUR BILLS IN THE CONSTITUTION AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL PASS THIS YEAR. WE'LL GET IN THE CONSTITUTION BY DON'T WANT TO STEP SITUATION WHICH WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND- CLARIFY WITH VOTERS SO. NO HAVE YOU SUPPORTED TODAY BUT IS SOMETHING I DO WANT TO SEE ON THE FLOOR.
