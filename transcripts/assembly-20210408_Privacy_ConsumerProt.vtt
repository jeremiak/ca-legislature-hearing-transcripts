00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:07.638
RECKLESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.706
BUT- YOU KNOW. THERE MIGHT BE A

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.575
MIDDLE GROUND HERE BUT I DO SEE

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:12.910
THAT. THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:14.745
TRYING TO FIX AND I THINK THE

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.181
SOLUTION- MAKES SENSE. I MEAN I

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:20.217
THINK THAT. THERE MIGHT BE-

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.518
ALSO ROOM TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:24.822
THAT- THE USER- CAN BE LIABLE

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.323
IF. I MEAN UNDER CURRENT ZONING

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.758
UNDER CURRENT LAW IS THEIR

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:28.659
INABILITY THERE IS AN ABILITY

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.394
TO. UNDER YOUR BILL YOU CAN

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:32.196
STILL RECOVER FROM THE USER IF

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.331

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:36.900
AUTOMATICALLY GO TO THE

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.270
COMPANY. SO THIS IS TO ALLOW.

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:42.539
DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE OF THAT.

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:45.309
THE USER WILL BE COVERED AND

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.477
THEN THEY CAN ALSO HELP MAKE

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.378
SURE THAT RECOVERY OF MEDICAL

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.279
EXPENSES AND THINGS THAT

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:51.915
NATURE- RECOVERABLE BY PERSON

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:54.218
WHO'S INJURED- SO THIS IS WHAT

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:56.587
THIS BILL WOULD DO OF WHAT THE

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:57.888

DOESN'T REMOVE. THE OPPORTUNITY

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:32.849

THE SCOOTERS TO DO THE RIGHT

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.290
THINGS I'M MORE TO THE POINT

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.825
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.126
UNDERWRITE THE POLICY FOR THE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.294
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.762
THEM TO DO THINGS TO GIVE THE

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.597
WRITERS THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO

DO THE RIGHT THING TO BE SAFER

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.233
IN WRITING THEM TO NOT LEAVE

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.602

ENTRY SO SOME OF WHAT WE'RE

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.039

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:57.307
PRIVATE MARKET IS ACTUALLY

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:58.742
GOING TO FIX WHEN WE PASS YOUR

00:52:58.808 --> 00:52:59.743
BILL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:00.844
ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THE

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:01.978
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.613
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.548
SURE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:06.283
WORK ARE USED IN A SAFER WAY

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.651
THAT DOESN'T INJURE PEOPLE SO

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.485
TO ME THIS IS THE PERFECT

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.654
EXAMPLE OF WHY INSURANCE WORKS.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.688

TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT HERE. IT

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:33.076
OCCURS TO ME THAT THAT'S IT'S

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.778
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.313
INCENTIVES ARE PROPERLY ALIGNED

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.348

LIABILITY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

DO WITH THE BILL IS TO MOVE IN

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.824
THAT DIRECTION COULD CORRECT

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.192
AND LAND IN A PLACE WHERE

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:30.694
THERE'S- SHARED LIABILITY

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.129
POTENTIALLY BETWEEN- THE

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:34.297
MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR OF

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:36.633
THE- THE- VEHICLE OR DEVICE

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.702
SORT OF ACTS CALLED. AND THE

SO THAT'S NOT GREAT. WHICH IS

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:59.155
PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON.

00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:01.558

INSURANCE PRODUCT DOESN'T EXIST

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.106

KIND OF MEASURE HOW MUCH THIS

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.262

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.520
SKALICA SO YOU YOU YOU YOU

01:20:58.587 --> 01:20:59.854
BELIEVE THERE IS A TECHNICAL

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.056
SOLUTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.024
TO GET. WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.259
GOING WITHOUT NECESSARILY

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.494
GETTING THE INFORMATION ON WHO

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:07.729

THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT-

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.215
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- TO

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.483
THE EXTENT THAT THAT I SUPPORT

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.018

THIS COMMITTEE WITHOUT A

WITH THEM. BUT I WILL STATE

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.318
THAT THERE ARE OTHER EFFECTIVE

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:04.919
MECHANISMS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:08.290

POTENTIALLY HIDE LABOR ABUSES

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:30.512

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.396
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TO ME AS

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:49.964
WE MOVE INTO THE ELECTRONIC

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.700
DIGITAL AGE WHERE WE ARE

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.134
CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF BEING

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:54.836
SURVEILLED BY THE DEVICES WE

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.372
HAVE ON A SORT DEVICES WE USE-

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.274

IDENTIFIED AS A GENERAL

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.449
PRINCIPLE AND TO. I THINK THIS

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:10.652
CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW- IT

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.252
TOO IS IF THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.421
TO GET. INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:14.422
LOCATION IT SHOULD GET A

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:15.924
WARRANT. I MEAN THESE ARE NOT

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.059
OUR THINGS IN MY FORMER LIFE AS

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:24.265
REASON YOU GET A JUDGE TO FIND

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.101
THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE A

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.769

SOMETHING THAT I HAVE HEARD

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.190
REPEATED A COUPLE TIMES HERE

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:58.927
WHICH IS- WE DO NOT GET ANY

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:03.031
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS ON ANY

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:04.933
OF THESE DEVICES. THE

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:08.203
INFORMATION COMES TO US IN A

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:11.272
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED NUMBER AND WE

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:14.042
ONLY KNOW THIS COMPANY HAD A

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:17.545
DEVICE AT THIS LOCATION I ALSO

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.280

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:28.323
THAT DATA IN REAL TIME EITHER

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.191
THERE'S A LACK ON THAT DATA

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:32.794
BEFORE REBOOT WE RECEIVE IT

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:35.864
HOWEVER IF A COMPANY- DROPPED A

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.666
BUNCH OF SCOOTERS ON A CORNER.

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.768
WE DO GET THAT INFORMATION SO

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:43.371
THE COMPANY CREATES AN EVENT WE

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.772
GET THAT INFORMATION

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.875
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:49.444
VERY SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT HOW

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.880
MANY DEVICES EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.282
COMPANY CAN HAVE ON EACH

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.951
INDIVIDUAL CORNER. IN VERY

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:59.354
CROWDED PLACES LIKE KOREATOWN

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.623
IN VENICE- WHERE WE HAVE A LOT

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:03.458
OF PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:04.859
AND OTHERWISE USING THE

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:08.930
SIDEWALK. SO FOR US- THE MAIN

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.965
SORT OF STICKING POINT HERE IS

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:13.201
THE AT THE AGGREGATION

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.570
REQUIREMENTS SO FOR US TO

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:17.372
RECEIVE AGGREGATED DATA FROM A

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.507
COMPANY MEANS THAT A COMPANY

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.709
CAN MANIPULATE IT BEFORE WE

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.411
RECEIVE IT. AND WE ARE

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:25.446
RECEIVING THIS DATA IN ORDER TO

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.382
CHARGE FEES AND TO HOLD THEM

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:28.850
ACCOUNTABLE FOR REGULATIONS

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.118
THAT ADDRESS EVERYTHING FROM

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:32.487
RACIAL EQUITY TO OUR CLIMATE

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:35.290
GOALS. SO FOR YOU KNOW OUR LONG

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:36.891
TRACK RECORD OF EXPERIENCE AS

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.394
REGULATORS IS THAT COMPANIES

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.729
HAVE A BUSINESS REASON TO

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:45.667
MANIPULATE. DATA IN ORDER TO

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.468
REDUCE THE FEES THEY PAY OR TO

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:48.269
INCREASE NUMBER THE OF THEIR

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:49.804
FLEET THEY CAN HOW ON THE WAY.

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.773
SO THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN PIECE

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:53.541
OF THE MAIN PIECE OF THE BILL

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.910
THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US-

01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:57.245
BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:58.980
HAVE INVESTIGATORS GO OUT AND

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.149
DO SPOT CHECKS MEANING. THEY

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.284
START ARRIVING AND DERIDE AND

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.019
WE SEE IF THAT DATA IS COMING

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:07.221
INTO OUR SYSTEM IN A VERIFIABLE

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.557
WAY SO THAT WE CAN TRUST ALL OF

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.559
THE DATA THAT WE'RE RECEIVING.

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:13.328
FROM COMPANIES AND AS WE LOOK

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:15.196
INTO THE FUTURE AND THINK ABOUT

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.998
A DRONE DELIVERIES AND THINK

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.033
ABOUT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.569
AND THINK ABOUT. REGULATION OF

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:24.105
OTHER FORMS OF A MOBILITY THAT

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.074
WE HAVEN'T EVEN IMAGINED YET-

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.010
HAVING VERIFIABLE DATA ABOUT

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:32.513
DEVICES NEVER EVER ABOUT USERS

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.515
IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:37.785
TO ALLOW A FEW SOLUTIONS TO

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:43.191

BRING THIS BILL FOR IT IT'S

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.798
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:51.766
FIGURE OUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.735
DATA TRANSPARENCY IN PROTECTING

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:54.702
THE PRIVACY AND SAFEGUARDING

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:57.372
CONSTITUENTS. I'M OFF TO MAKE

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:58.206
THIS A BRIEF BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

SAID. WE LIVE IN AN ERA RIGHT

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.913
NOW WHERE THAT IMMENSE. DATA

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.383
RIGHT NOW HAS SUCH GREAT USES

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.017
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.486
OUT HOW TO. PROPERLY PLAN OUR

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:13.621
STREETS AND ALSO MAKE A PROP

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:14.255
TWENTY TWO THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:29.467
NO MATTER WHO IS AT THE TABLE

02:18:29.534 --> 02:18:31.202
AT THE TIME WHO THE DIRECTOR IS

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:33.204
WHO WE ARE WHO'S IN OUR SEATS

02:18:33.271 --> 02:18:35.874
WHOSE- RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.142
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.044
CONTINUES TO BE A PROCESS

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:41.713
VERSUS WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE-

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.848
BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN THE

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:46.751
LOSS OF ALL THOSE MILLIONS AND

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.653
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD HAVE

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:50.689
GONE TOWARDS EDUCATION THEY

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:51.523
COULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:52.824
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY COULD HAVE

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:55.293
GONE TOWARD. ADDITIONAL RELIEF

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.828
FOR SO MANY HURTING OF

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.396
CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S

02:18:58.463 --> 02:18:59.464
UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE A

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:02.333
SYSTEM- AT ASSIST DEPARTMENTS

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:03.168
AND AGENCIES THAT SIMPLY DON'T

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:04.803
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER AND THAT

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:05.637
WHAT THE PANDEMIC HAS

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:07.906
DEFINITELY SHOWN US IS THAT WE

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:10.275
NEED TO CRITICALLY INVEST IN

02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:12.510
BEAN TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT OF

02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:14.212
OUR DEPARTMENTS TO ONE ENSURE

02:19:14.279 --> 02:19:16.414
THAT THEY ARE MORE UP TO DATE

02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:17.282
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:19:17.348 --> 02:19:19.050
PROBLEMS THAT EDT FACES AND

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.719
THAT IT'S WORKING WITH THAT-

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:22.220
AND ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT

02:19:22.287 --> 02:19:24.255
DOESN'T MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS-

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:25.523
AND IT'S CURRENTLY ON A VERY

02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:28.593
FRAGILE FRAGILE LYING AND SO I

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:29.627
KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:19:29.694 --> 02:19:31.162
WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOWARDS-

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:33.364
IN THE FUTURE- BUT RIGHT NOW

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.833
WHAT WE CAN DO IS ENSURE THAT

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:36.668
AS MORE RELIEF COME TOWARDS.

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.236
TOWARDS CALIFORNIANS THAT

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:39.537
AGENCIES ARE SPEAKING TO EACH

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.972
OTHER TO AVOID ANY ADDITIONAL

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:42.373
FRAUD I'M PROUD TO BE A CO

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.375
AUTHOR ON YOUR BILL I THINK

02:19:43.441 --> 02:19:44.175
IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:48.446
DIRECTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:49.047
ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:50.882
PAUL. C. THAT I. MAKE THIS. NET

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:53.184
THAT CALIFORNIANS- REALLY

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:54.185
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THINKING

02:19:54.252 --> 02:19:56.821
ABOUT. EDT IS A IS A SAFETY NET

02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:58.723
THAT SHOULD FUNCTION SHOULD

02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:02.260
WORK. AND THE NOTION THAT THAT

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:03.595
THIS TYPE OF FRAUD OCCURRED

02:20:03.661 --> 02:20:05.096
SIMPLY BECAUSE TO AGENCIES

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.197
DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH EACH

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:07.999
OTHER. AND DURING A GLOBAL

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:09.734
PANDEMIC AS WE TRY TO FIGURE

02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:11.903
OUT HOW WE CAN HELP PEOPLE. IS

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:13.538
ACTUALLY KIND OF MIND BOGGLING.

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:16.474
SO THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:17.075
DIRECTION I'M REALLY HAPPY TO

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:18.276

NEEDS OF CITIZENS IN NEW WAYS

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:44.248
IS THE REASON WHY GOVERNMENTS

02:33:44.315 --> 02:33:46.183

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:40.123
PLEASE PRESS. ONE ZERO. THIS

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.424
TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:44.194
QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. OTHER

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:44.728
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:50.133
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:52.068
ASSEMBLY WOMAN TARA OKAY THANK

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:54.137
YOU THANK YOU MISTER ASHER. I

02:46:54.204 --> 02:46:58.641
AM SO I JUST LOOKED AT. I

02:46:58.708 --> 02:47:00.210
RESHAPE WE'RE DOING HERE MISTER

02:47:00.276 --> 02:47:01.544
CHAIR AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:03.480
IMPORTANT WORK BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:04.047
THAT THESE DECISIONS SYSTEMS

02:47:04.114 --> 02:47:08.084
ARE. AND HURRIEDLY AND HARLEY

02:47:08.151 --> 02:47:08.685
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE

02:47:08.752 --> 02:47:11.354
PROBLEMATIC- WHEN IT COMES TO

02:47:11.421 --> 02:47:13.289
INDIVIDUALS WHO HISTORICALLY

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:15.558
HAVE SUFFERED. AB AND WE NEED

02:47:15.625 --> 02:47:16.893
TO WORK TO CORRECT THAT

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:17.927
ESPECIALLY IN THE WORK WE DO AS

02:47:17.994 --> 02:47:19.662
A STATE. SO I THINK THIS BILL

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:20.997
IS REALLY IMPORTANT I DO

02:47:21.064 --> 02:47:23.366
HOWEVER SHARE THE CONCERNS OF

02:47:23.433 --> 02:47:23.867
THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE

02:47:23.933 --> 02:47:26.169
BREADTH OF THIS BILL- YOU KNOW

02:47:26.236 --> 02:47:27.771
HIGH RISK APPLICATION SOUNDS

02:47:27.837 --> 02:47:28.705
LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:29.873
LIMITED UNTIL YOU READ THE

02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:32.475
DEFINITION INCLUDES EVERYTHING

02:47:32.542 --> 02:47:33.710
THAT AFFECTS THE LEGAL RIGHTS.

02:47:33.777 --> 02:47:37.313
HEALTH AND WELL BEING. HAVE A

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.516
NATURAL PERSON WHICH I WOULD

02:47:39.582 --> 02:47:40.483
ARGUE IS EVERYTHING WE DO IS A

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:42.952
STATE- I MEAN IF WE'RE NOT

02:47:43.019 --> 02:47:44.053
DOING SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.855
NATURAL PEOPLE THEN I DON'T

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:47.490
NOTICE WE DO EVERY DAY SO I

02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:48.158
DON'T KNOW THAT THE HIGHER RISK

02:47:48.224 --> 02:47:49.659
APPLICATION DEFINITION LIMITS

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.694
IT AND SO THEN I LOOK TO THE

02:47:51.761 --> 02:47:53.363
AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEM AND

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:55.732
IT DOES SEEM INCREDIBLY BROAD

02:47:55.799 --> 02:47:57.667
IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH.

02:47:57.734 --> 02:48:00.003
COMMITTEE IT APPEARED AT THAT

02:48:00.069 --> 02:48:01.471
THE ATTEMPT TO NARROW IT WAS

02:48:01.538 --> 02:48:04.741
DONE THROUGH THIS- MODIFIER OF

02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:06.476
OR OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:08.978
WHICH NOT BEING A TAX EXPERT

02:48:09.045 --> 02:48:10.814
TECH EXPERT AND TO BE HONEST AT

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.881
THIS MOMENT I MISSING OUR

02:48:11.948 --> 02:48:14.818
FORMER COLLEAGUE JAY OBERNOLTE

02:48:14.884 --> 02:48:15.418
WHO I KNOW WOULD HAVE LOTS OF

02:48:15.485 --> 02:48:18.555
THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL- BUT- YOU

02:48:18.621 --> 02:48:20.657
KNOW. I READ THAT TO BE A

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:22.292
FOURTH OPTION SO COULD BE A

02:48:22.358 --> 02:48:23.726
SCORE CLASS CATION RECOGNITION

02:48:23.793 --> 02:48:25.428
OR OTHER SIMPLE FIND OUT PUT.

02:48:25.495 --> 02:48:26.629
AND MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT

02:48:26.696 --> 02:48:28.465
WAS SUPPOSED TO MODIFY THE LIST

02:48:28.531 --> 02:48:29.666
SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.234
CHANGES TO NARROW IT SO IT

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:32.869
ISN'T EVERY SINGLE COMPUTER

02:48:32.936 --> 02:48:34.003
APPLICATION THAT WE USE IS A

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.904
STATE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:48:34.971 --> 02:48:36.606
THAT. I MEAN CORRECT ME IF I'M

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.607
WRONG I DON'T THINK THAT IS

02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:38.775
YOUR INTENT NOR DO I THINK

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:40.310
THAT'S NECESSARY I DO THINK

02:48:40.376 --> 02:48:41.211
WE'RE TRYING TO GET A VERY

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:43.046
SPECIFIC PROBLEM HERE. AND THE

02:48:43.112 --> 02:48:44.280
MORE WE CAN NARROW IT THE

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:45.048
BETTER IT WILL BE SO CAN YOU

02:48:45.114 --> 02:48:47.217
ADDRESS THAT AND- YOU KNOW LET

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.284
ME KNOW IF YOU'RE CONTINUING TO

02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:49.385
WORK ON THAT DEFINITION IN

02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:51.054
HOPES OF NARROWING IT. THANK

02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:52.088
YOU FOR VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:48:52.155 --> 02:48:53.556
QUESTION MAYBE BY WAY OF

02:48:53.623 --> 02:48:55.391
BACKGROUND. OF THIS BILL WAS

02:48:55.458 --> 02:48:57.327
INTRODUCED ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

02:48:57.393 --> 02:48:59.529
AND WHEN WE INTRODUCED IT THE

02:48:59.596 --> 02:49:01.364
OPPOSITION REYES VERY SIMILAR

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:02.465
CONCERNS OR IF NOT IDENTICL

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:04.067
CONCERNS. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE

02:49:04.133 --> 02:49:06.302
MAIN MAIN. CONCERN WAS THAT THE

02:49:06.369 --> 02:49:07.770
PRESS OF THE TO THE

02:49:07.837 --> 02:49:10.473
DEFINITIONS. AND SO WE REACHED

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:12.175
OUT TO THE OPPOSITION AND TRY

02:49:12.242 --> 02:49:14.210
TO KIND OF. FIND OUT OF THE

02:49:14.277 --> 02:49:16.079
BEST PRACTICES AND YOU KNOW.

02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:17.614
WHATEVER INPUT THEY MIGHT HOUSE

02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:19.249
SO THAT WE COULD KINDA USED TO

02:49:19.315 --> 02:49:21.184
NARROW THE- SCOPE OF THE BILL.

02:49:21.251 --> 02:49:23.653
AFTER WAITING A YEAR OR SO- AND

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.321
RECEIVING NO INPUT FROM THEM.

02:49:25.388 --> 02:49:27.390
WE TOOK IT UPON US OURSELVES

02:49:27.457 --> 02:49:29.392
TO. START TO AYE WE STARTED

02:49:29.459 --> 02:49:32.328
NARAL THE BILL SUBSTANTIALLY.

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:34.397
SO CURRENTLY- THE BILL ONLY

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:38.401
PERTAINS TO ATS IS. THAT AS YOU

02:49:38.468 --> 02:49:41.404
POINTED OUT- APPLY TO HIGH RISK

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:43.706
APPLICATIONS- WHICH ARE FURTHER

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:46.042
DEFINED IN THE BILL ITSELF. AS

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:46.943
MEETING ONE OF THE THREE

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:51.581
CRITERIA AND I COULD SPELL. IT

02:49:51.648 --> 02:49:52.215
ALL OUT IF YOU WANT. BUT THAT'S

02:49:52.282 --> 02:49:52.849
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DONE IN

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:54.717
ADDITION. THE LANGUAGE NOW

02:49:54.784 --> 02:49:57.487
PROVIDES FOR- THE C. T. WHICH

02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:59.155
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

02:49:59.222 --> 02:50:01.124
TO ALSO. FURTHER PRESCRIBED

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:03.126
GUIDELINES AND TELL YOU KNOW

02:50:03.192 --> 02:50:04.694
TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD. WHAT

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.896
OTHER APPLICATIONS ARE SUBJECT.

02:50:06.963 --> 02:50:08.965
TO THIS THIS LAW. SO IT IS NT

02:50:09.032 --> 02:50:11.434
REALLY. YOU KNOW TO OVERRIDE IT

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:13.536
IN THAT REGARD. AND I THINK THE

02:50:13.603 --> 02:50:15.305
TERM HIGH RISK IS YOU KNOW

02:50:15.371 --> 02:50:17.273
DEFINE. IN VERY MINUTE TERMS-

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.043
SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION. BUT I

02:50:20.109 --> 02:50:21.444
THINK IF THE CONCERN IS WHETHER

02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:23.146
OR NOT. THE DEFINITION WORKED

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:24.814
OUT YOU KNOW SWEEP UP THINGS

02:50:24.881 --> 02:50:26.282
LIKE COMPUTERS OR OR OR-

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:28.284
CALCULATORS AND SPREADSHEETS. I

02:50:28.351 --> 02:50:30.186
THINK WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:32.188
WE WILL DO GOING FORWARD IS TO

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:35.158
PROBABLY. ALL AMENDED THE BILL

02:50:35.224 --> 02:50:37.293
TO EXPLICITLY EXT EXCLUDE THOSE

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:39.062
SELL ITEMS FROM FROM THE BILL.

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:40.563
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT INTENT RIGHT

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:41.664
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE NOT WE

02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:43.466
DON'T INTEND TO GO TO INCLUDE

02:50:43.533 --> 02:50:45.501
EVERY SINGLE- CALCULATOR OUT

02:50:45.568 --> 02:50:46.970
THERE I MEAN THAT MAKES NO

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:48.137
SENSE. AND I THINK THE WORK

02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:49.606
THAT THE BUZZWORD THEIR DATE

02:50:49.672 --> 02:50:50.974
THAT THE KEY WORD THERE IS A

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.109
MATERIAL I THINK. SO

02:50:53.176 --> 02:50:55.078
CALCULATORS DO NOT MATERIALLY

02:50:55.144 --> 02:50:57.146
AFFECT YOU KNOW HUMANIZE IT. SO

02:50:57.213 --> 02:50:58.481
BUT I THINK IN ORDER TO

02:50:58.548 --> 02:50:59.916
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:50:59.983 --> 02:51:01.050
I THINK WILL WILLING TO DO THAT

02:51:01.117 --> 02:51:02.452
AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

02:51:02.518 --> 02:51:04.387
YOURSELF. AND THE LANGUAGE THAT

02:51:04.454 --> 02:51:06.889
WE ARE USING. IS TAKEN ACTUALLY

02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:08.925
FROM A VERY SO. LET'S SAY THE

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:10.460
FOR THE FOR- THERE WAS A LOT OF

02:51:10.526 --> 02:51:13.162
FEDERAL LEGISLATION- THAT- WE

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:13.796
KIND OF BORROWED SOME LANGUAGE

02:51:13.863 --> 02:51:16.466
FROM. SO WE WILL BE HAPPY TO DO

02:51:16.532 --> 02:51:18.568
THAT- JUST TO KIND OF CLEAR THE

02:51:18.635 --> 02:51:20.203
AIR AND WE DON'T. INTEND TO

02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:21.838
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THOSE. BUT

02:51:21.904 --> 02:51:24.040
UP I THINK THE ARE THE SPONSOR

02:51:24.107 --> 02:51:26.509
HAS- YOU KNOW HAS SOME INSIGHTS

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:28.678
AND PERHAPS MORE EXPERTISE. IF

02:51:28.745 --> 02:51:31.314
I COULD- TURN TO THE SPONSOR

02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:32.315
FOR ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:35.018
MISTER CHAIR- MR REALLY

SIMILAR. PRESIDENT AND BOTH THE

02:51:45.561 --> 02:51:46.162
EUROPEAN UNION AD CANNOT AND

02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:47.664
IN REQUIRE. IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

02:51:47.730 --> 02:51:49.532
AND- I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE

02:51:49.599 --> 02:51:51.668
CANADA DEFINITION OF AN EIGHTY

02:51:51.734 --> 02:51:54.671
YES. TECHNOLOGY REPLACES THE

02:51:54.737 --> 02:51:55.838
JUDGMENT OF HUMAN DECISION

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:58.107
MAKERS SO IN COMPARISON TO

02:51:58.174 --> 02:52:00.877
THAT- ARE- YOU KNOW LANGUAGE IS

02:52:00.943 --> 02:52:03.146
MUCH MORE NARROWED- IN THE E.

02:52:03.212 --> 02:52:05.314
U. IT'S JUST DATA PROCESS IT

02:52:05.381 --> 02:52:09.152
MEANS. DATA OR SAT THAT'S NOT

02:52:09.218 --> 02:52:11.020
FAIR- YOU KNOW IN IN THAT

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:13.089
CONTEXT. AB THIRTEEN IS

ACTUALLY VERY MORE VERY MUCH

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:17.026
MORE SPECIFIC AND- I WOULD

INTO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:52:22.231 --> 02:52:23.966
SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT AND HOW THAT

02:52:24.033 --> 02:52:27.470
CAN HELP NARROW- THE

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:33.076

THAT KIND OF SAY THAT THE

02:52:47.423 --> 02:52:49.726
ANALYSIS FROM THE FROM THE

02:52:49.792 --> 02:52:50.693
COMMITTEE COVERED THAT

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.428
SITUATION PRETTY WELL EIGHT

02:52:52.495 --> 02:52:53.429
EIGHT SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT MEANS

02:52:53.496 --> 02:52:55.064
THE DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION MEANS

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:56.499
TAKING A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:52:56.566 --> 02:52:59.068
VARIABLES- AND THEN COME COME

02:52:59.135 --> 02:53:00.536
COLLAPSING BACK INTO ONE

02:53:00.603 --> 02:53:01.938
PARTICULAR VARIABLE BUT IT'S

02:53:02.004 --> 02:53:03.973
NOT SOMETHING A CALCULATOR DOES

02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:04.907
AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

02:53:04.974 --> 02:53:06.042
ADDING THE SAME VARIABLE

02:53:06.109 --> 02:53:07.610
YACHTING I NUMBER PLUS THE

02:53:07.677 --> 02:53:09.145
NUMBER BUT THE NUMBER THAT'S

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:11.681
NOT A DIMENSIONAL REDUCTIONS.

02:53:11.748 --> 02:53:13.082
THIS DEFINITION WAS TALK TO

02:53:13.149 --> 02:53:13.950
WITH A LOT OF COMPUTER

02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:15.785
SCIENTISTS AND DATA SCIENTISTS

02:53:15.852 --> 02:53:17.520
TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO THREAD

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:19.088
THAT NEEDLE AND- YOU KNOW AS

02:53:19.155 --> 02:53:20.189
THE AUTHORS STATED WHERE WE'RE

02:53:20.256 --> 02:53:21.991
WILLING TO WORK- WE JUST NEED

02:53:22.058 --> 02:53:26.129
SOME HELP FROM- THE OPPOSITION

02:53:26.195 --> 02:53:26.829
THAT THE HELP NARROW THAT. I

02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:28.030
THINK YOU AND I AM NOT THE

02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:29.732
OPPOSITION BUT- AND I

02:53:29.799 --> 02:53:30.900
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:32.335
WITH OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT

02:53:32.401 --> 02:53:33.736
AND I THINK THAT MY- CONCERN IS

02:53:33.803 --> 02:53:34.604
ACTUALLY STATUTORY

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:36.072
INTERPRETATION WHICH IS. THAT I

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:37.573
DIDN'T READ THAT TO SAY THAT

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:38.875
THE OTHER SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT

02:53:38.941 --> 02:53:39.809
MEANT THE SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT

02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:41.344
APPLIED TO SCORE CLASSIFICATION

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:42.845
RECOMMENDATION. TO ME THAT WAS

02:53:42.912 --> 02:53:44.347
A LIST AND OTHER SOME OF APPLE

02:53:44.413 --> 02:53:46.549
WAS A FOURTH. ELEMENT AND SO I

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:47.283
THINK IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:53:47.350 --> 02:53:48.651
DO THERE IS LIMITED. TO

02:53:48.718 --> 02:53:49.619
EVERYTHING THAT PROVIDES A

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:50.920
SIMPLIFIED OUTPUT IT JUST NEEDS

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:52.421
TO BE RE DRAFTED TO CLARIFY

02:53:52.488 --> 02:53:53.022
THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT MY

02:53:53.089 --> 02:53:54.357
READING IS THAT. THE

02:53:54.423 --> 02:53:56.526
LEGISLATION BUT I THINK IT DOES

02:53:56.592 --> 02:53:57.360
HELP TO CLARIFY AND I THINK WE

02:53:57.426 --> 02:54:00.563
CAN. IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED FIX.

02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:01.864
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.

02:54:01.931 --> 02:54:05.201

CLARIFICATION JUST IT IT IS A

02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:20.950
COMPLICATED BILL FOR ARC FOR

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:22.985
NONTECHNICAL PEOPLE AND TERMS

YOUR ALGORITHM TO. TO

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:52.248
GOVERNMENTS AND MANY OTHER

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.516
PRIVATE INDUSTRIES THINKING

02:54:53.583 --> 02:54:54.483
THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:57.753
SUBJECT THEIR- YOU KNOW THEIR

02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:01.324

DISCLOSURE. HOW DO YOU RESPOND

02:55:06.362 --> 02:55:07.430

02:55:07.496 --> 02:55:08.698
BILL DO THAT OR THEY BE

02:55:08.764 --> 02:55:10.499
REQUIRED TO KIND OF GIVE THEIR

02:55:10.566 --> 02:55:12.335

THAT IN FACT THE RECENT SET OF

02:55:19.709 --> 02:55:20.843
AMENDMENTS- MAKE IT VERY CLEAR

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:23.079
THAT- WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR

02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:23.946
TRADE SECRETS OR ANY

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:26.349
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION- SO

02:55:26.415 --> 02:55:28.050
THEY ARE NOT. FOR EXAMPLE SEE

02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:30.319
THE T. R. WHO SHOULD NOT BE

02:55:30.386 --> 02:55:32.154

SECRETS OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:36.492
INFORMATION. OF THAT WOULD BE

02:55:36.559 --> 02:55:38.594
DEEMED OF PROPRIETARY SO THAT'S

02:55:38.661 --> 02:55:40.863
IN INDIA AGAIN AND SO. I WAS

02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:43.266
NOT IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION BUT

02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:45.234
IS IT'S IN THE CURRENT VERSION.

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:55.845
OKAY- AND THEN I MEAN. I GUESS

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.079
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS HOW DO YOU

02:55:57.146 --> 02:56:03.886
HOW DO YOU GET AT. MAY

02:56:03.953 --> 02:56:05.888
NECESSARILY THESE TYPES OF

02:56:05.955 --> 02:56:10.192
SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO-

02:56:10.259 --> 02:56:11.527
HOW MANY NINE KEY WORDS IN

02:56:11.594 --> 02:56:12.595
THERE AND THEY'RE CREATED BY

02:56:12.662 --> 02:56:14.163
HUMAN BEINGS SO THEY'RE ALL TO

02:56:14.230 --> 02:56:15.798
MANY GONNA HAVE ISSUES WITH

02:56:15.865 --> 02:56:17.900
THEM BUT THE IDEA BEING THAT

02:56:17.967 --> 02:56:18.401
THEY KIND OF HELP CREATE

02:56:18.467 --> 02:56:23.406
EFFICIENCIES- I MEAN CAN YOU

02:56:23.472 --> 02:56:24.006
REALLY CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S

02:56:24.073 --> 02:56:27.043
PERFECTLY. A PERFECTLY AN

02:56:27.109 --> 02:56:31.280
OBJECTIVE SYSTEM- WELL YOU'RE

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.348
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT- IS

02:56:32.415 --> 02:56:34.216
GALLAGHER I THINK I WOULD I

02:56:34.283 --> 02:56:35.217
TRYING TO CREATE A PERFECT

02:56:35.284 --> 02:56:38.054
SYSTEM- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:39.789
SOMEWHAT BIASED IN A WAY WHAT

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.457
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SHINE

02:56:41.524 --> 02:56:43.426
SOME LIGHT ON THESE ALGORITHMS

02:56:43.492 --> 02:56:45.094
ON THESE BLACK BOXES WHICH HAVE

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:47.096
BEEN COLLABORATED THROUGHOUT

02:56:47.163 --> 02:56:47.964
THAT YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS

02:56:48.030 --> 02:56:49.966
INDUSTRIES AND OF THE PROBLEM

02:56:50.032 --> 02:56:51.400
IS YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW

02:56:51.467 --> 02:56:52.835
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THESE BLACK

02:56:52.902 --> 02:56:54.637
BOXES DO WIN AND WE DON'T KNOW

02:56:54.704 --> 02:56:56.472
WHAT KIND OF DATA GOES INTO THE

02:56:56.539 --> 02:56:58.207
SYSTEM AND WHAT COMES OUT I

02:56:58.274 --> 02:56:59.275
MEAN WEEK SOMETIMES WE KNOW

02:56:59.342 --> 02:57:00.376
WHAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW WHAT COMES

02:57:00.443 --> 02:57:02.178
OUT OF IT- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

02:57:02.244 --> 02:57:04.313
PEOPLE COULD USE UP. OUR FLIGHT

02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:07.049
RISKS- AND LET'S SEE OF THE

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:09.151
PREVIOUS CRIMINAL HISTORY AND

02:57:09.218 --> 02:57:11.253
THEY USE THAT INFORMATION AND

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:12.388
DAHLE YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:14.423
COULD BE- BILL AMOUNT FOR

02:57:14.490 --> 02:57:15.791
EXAMPLE SO BUT WE DON'T KNOW

02:57:15.858 --> 02:57:17.393
WHAT THAT BLACK BOXES WE DON'T

02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.260
KNOW WHAT THE MECHANISM WHAT

02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:19.829
THEOTHER THING IS THAT THAT

02:57:19.895 --> 02:57:21.263
MAKES THAT DECISION FOR PEOPLE

02:57:21.330 --> 02:57:23.165
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENT OF

02:57:23.232 --> 02:57:24.934
THE BILL SO FOR TOO LONG I

02:57:25.001 --> 02:57:27.470
THINK WE'VE BEEN- ALLOWING- YOU

02:57:27.536 --> 02:57:29.205
KNOW THE SYSTEMS TO PROLIFERATE

02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:30.773
OUT THERE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT BUT

02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:31.874
THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO IN

02:57:31.941 --> 02:57:33.476
FACT. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE I

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:34.877
THINK WITH THAT WE CITED THREE

02:57:34.944 --> 02:57:36.979
EXAMPLES IN MY OPENING AND YOU

02:57:37.046 --> 02:57:38.881
KNOW FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE'S

02:57:38.948 --> 02:57:41.584
INFORMATION- YOU KNOW- THAT WAS

02:57:41.650 --> 02:57:43.786
USED- IN FACT A FRAUDULENT YOU

02:57:43.853 --> 02:57:45.454
WRONGFULLY USED IN AND THEY

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:46.722
WERE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING

02:57:46.789 --> 02:57:50.026
FRAUD AND ON APPEAL ONLY 8% OF

02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:52.094
THOSE CASES ARE TURNED OUT TO

02:57:52.161 --> 02:57:55.164
BE VALID SO THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:57:55.231 --> 02:57:56.165
THIRTY TWO THOUSAND UP PEOPLE'S

02:57:56.232 --> 02:57:58.601
CASES WERE INVALID BECAUSE OF

02:57:58.667 --> 02:58:01.037
THE USE OF WRONGFUL AUGUR THEM

02:58:01.103 --> 02:58:02.038
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE

02:58:02.104 --> 02:58:03.172
AUTHOR WITHIN LESS THAN YOU

02:58:03.239 --> 02:58:04.306
KNOW EXCEPT FOR THE YOU HAVE

02:58:04.373 --> 02:58:06.375
DEVELOPER OR THE PEOPLE USING

02:58:06.442 --> 02:58:08.244
AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT.

02:58:08.310 --> 02:58:10.679
SO WE YOU KNOW ALL WE WANT TO

02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:12.214
DO NOW IS TO IS TO SHINE SOME

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:14.116
LIGHT ON THAT BLACK BOX ON

02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:15.251
THOSE ALTERNATIVES THAT PEOPLE

02:58:15.317 --> 02:58:16.652
USE THESE DAYS AND WE'RE

02:58:16.719 --> 02:58:19.922
LIMITING IT TO THE GOVERNMENT

02:58:19.989 --> 02:58:21.824
AGENCIES WHO USE THESE CELL

02:58:21.891 --> 02:58:24.760
OPERATIVES OR THE CDSS SO IT'S

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:27.329
A VERY IN THE NARROW SCOPE IT

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:33.803
OUT IN MANY WAYS- WE'RE NOT

02:58:33.869 --> 02:58:34.437
REQUIRING EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS

02:58:34.503 --> 02:58:36.072
TO DO- SO WE'RE- LIKE A- YOU

02:58:36.138 --> 02:58:37.273
KNOW WE ALSO. PROVIDING FOR CD

02:58:37.339 --> 02:58:39.575
TO PAY- PRESCRIBE A LITTLE

02:58:39.642 --> 02:58:41.510
MORE- GUIDELINES FOR PEOPLE TO

02:58:41.577 --> 02:58:44.513
COMPLY WITH. SO THIS IS A VERY

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:46.816
NARAL- NARROWLY TAILOR-

02:58:46.882 --> 02:58:49.885
SOLUTION. TO A PROBLEM THAT'S

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:50.453
BEEN OUT THERE NOBODY'S BEEN

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:53.022
LOOKING OUT OF. BUT I THINK

02:58:53.089 --> 02:58:53.923
THAT THIS WITNESS ALSO

02:58:53.989 --> 02:58:55.524
MENTIONED THAT A CANDIDATE IS

02:58:55.591 --> 02:58:57.860
USING IT- THE YOU IS USING AT

02:58:57.927 --> 02:58:59.095
THE YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE IN

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:01.397
EUROPE ARE USING ITSELF. SO WE

02:59:01.464 --> 02:59:01.964
HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING AT THE

02:59:02.031 --> 02:59:04.633
ISSUE- TOO CLOSELY NEW YORK

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.469
HOUSING IT OFF ALL PAST ACTS

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:09.105
COMPOSED OF A ATTACK OF TASK

02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:11.006
FORCES TO LOOK INTO THE ISSUE.

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:12.408
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IS

02:59:12.475 --> 02:59:13.542
DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO

02:59:13.609 --> 02:59:14.844
WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT

02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:17.713
NOW- SO. THIS IS NO I THINK YOU

02:59:17.780 --> 02:59:19.482
KNOW WE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA.

02:59:19.548 --> 02:59:20.883
ALL WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AT

YEARS AGO THAT WE OF THIS

02:59:42.805 --> 02:59:44.373
COMMITTEE PASSED A RESOLUTION

02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:45.541
ENDORSING THE ASILOMAR

02:59:46.876 --> 02:59:48.811
BENEFICIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.880
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH-

OPPOSITION- IF YOU WILL AND DO

03:00:29.018 --> 03:00:31.387
YOU AGREE THAT. I SHOULD ALSO

03:00:31.453 --> 03:00:33.122
ADD BY THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW

03:00:33.189 --> 03:00:34.890
IT'S A NOTHING OF A CONCERN

03:00:34.957 --> 03:00:36.358
WHEN WE HAVE THE LIKES OF

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:38.327
FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE. THEY'RE

03:00:38.394 --> 03:00:40.162
USING ALGORITHMS TO SORT OF

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:42.331
SHAPE OUR PREFERENCES WHO HAS

03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:43.499
THAT WE DON'T REALLY

03:00:43.566 --> 03:00:46.402
UNDERSTAND- BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

03:00:46.468 --> 03:00:48.804
THE GOVERNMENT DOING THAT- IT'S

03:00:48.871 --> 03:00:50.873
A WHOLE NOTHER MATTER IT RAISES

03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:52.741
I THINK- QUESTIONS OF

03:00:52.808 --> 03:00:54.243
DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY AND

03:00:54.310 --> 03:00:56.078
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SO THAT'S

03:00:56.145 --> 03:00:58.480
WHY I'M I'M SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS

03:00:58.547 --> 03:00:59.715
THAT THE GOAL OF THIS IS A

03:00:59.782 --> 03:01:01.217
QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION IS.

03:01:01.283 --> 03:01:03.352
DO YOU DO YOU AGREE THAT THIS

03:01:03.419 --> 03:01:07.389
IDEAOF EXPLAINED ABILITY IS.

03:01:07.456 --> 03:01:09.458
AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE- WHEN IT

03:01:09.525 --> 03:01:11.760
COMES TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING

03:01:11.827 --> 03:01:14.730
AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES- AND IF

03:01:14.797 --> 03:01:17.900
SO HOW COULD THIS BILL BE. MORE

03:01:17.967 --> 03:01:19.568
NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ACHIEVE

03:01:19.635 --> 03:01:21.804
THAT GOAL WITHOUT THAT SORT OF

03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:26.609
CONCERNS. YOU'RE RAISING ABOUT

03:01:26.675 --> 03:01:33.616
OVER BREATH. AND THIS IS FOR MR

03:01:33.682 --> 03:01:35.184
MOHAMMED WITHOUT CALCHAMBER. IF

03:01:35.251 --> 03:01:42.558
YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. I AM

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:43.692
ON THE LINE AND I APPRECIATE

03:01:43.759 --> 03:01:46.996

03:01:47.062 --> 03:01:48.631
WITH REGARD TO- AT YOU KNOW

03:01:48.697 --> 03:01:50.266
ATTEMPTING TO CATER TO AMEND

03:01:50.332 --> 03:01:51.800
THE BILL TO. PUT IT IN A PLACE

03:01:51.867 --> 03:01:52.768
WHERE WHERE WE NEED MORE

03:01:52.835 --> 03:01:54.603
WORKABLE- I THINK AT THIS POINT

03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:56.338
REALLY COMES DOWN TO- YOU KNOW

03:01:56.405 --> 03:01:57.706
SURGICALLY DEFINING TERMS LIKE

03:01:57.773 --> 03:01:59.275
AUTOMATED DISPENSING SYSTEM AND

03:01:59.341 --> 03:02:01.577
HIGH RISK APPLICATION- ON OUR

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:03.812
END- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT

03:02:03.879 --> 03:02:06.348
WOULD BE RATHER- IT WAS A

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:08.350
LITTLE TALK TO CRAFT-

03:02:08.417 --> 03:02:10.185
DEFINITIONS OF COURSE- YOU KNOW

03:02:10.252 --> 03:02:11.620
BURKE FOR LEGISLATION POLICY

03:02:11.687 --> 03:02:13.455
THEY'RE PERFECT BUT- WE DO

03:02:13.522 --> 03:02:14.189
THINK THERE ARE SOME

03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.391
IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE

03:02:15.457 --> 03:02:17.760
HOWEVER- I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:18.727
SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE

03:02:18.794 --> 03:02:19.461
WORKING WITH THE- WITH THE

03:02:19.528 --> 03:02:21.263

SUFFICIENTLY. I THINK IT DOES

03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:28.871

TRADE COMMISSION IS IT JUST

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:34.576

03:02:39.181 --> 03:02:40.749
A AYE VERSUS A STANDARD SORT OF

03:02:40.816 --> 03:02:42.851
COMPUTATION IS. IS TRICKY I

PLACE CITED EARLIER. THAT THAT

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:02.604
THEY WERE SORTS THAT WE COULD

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:04.473

03:10:57.512 --> 03:10:58.880
ARGUMENT IS OUT YOU KNOW THAT

03:10:58.947 --> 03:10:59.815
WE'RE REQUIRING CONSUMER

03:10:59.881 --> 03:11:01.416
ADVOCACY WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING

03:11:01.483 --> 03:11:02.751
THAT WE TRY TO DO. ALL WE

03:11:02.818 --> 03:11:04.619
TRYING TO DO IS A SOMEBODY WITH

03:11:04.686 --> 03:11:07.756
YOUR CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WHICH-COULD BE PICKED UP ANY ANY

03:11:07.823 --> 03:11:10.292
ANYWHERE. FOR EXAMPLE I THINK-

03:11:10.358 --> 03:11:12.394
HOUSE AN EXAMPLE HERE- LET'S

03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:13.795
SEE ACADEMIC STUDY OF CONSUMER

03:11:13.862 --> 03:11:15.397
RIGHTS ARE YOU KNOW OR

03:11:15.463 --> 03:11:17.432
EXPERIENCE- HELPING INDUSTRIES

03:11:17.499 --> 03:11:18.767
NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITY OF

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:20.535
COME CONSUMER LAW. SO IT COULD

03:11:20.602 --> 03:11:22.270
IT'S A VERY BROAD TERMINOLOGY

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:24.005
THAT COULD TELL QUALIFY UNDER

03:11:24.072 --> 03:11:26.341
THE DEFINITION. SO WE'RE NOT

03:11:26.408 --> 03:11:28.577
WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW LIMITING-

03:11:28.643 --> 03:11:30.545

03:11:30.612 --> 03:11:33.181
PARTICULAR- ELEMENTS TO THAT

03:11:33.248 --> 03:11:36.885
TERMINOLOGY. BECAUSE IT OCCURS

03:11:36.952 --> 03:11:38.820
TO ME. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT

03:11:38.887 --> 03:11:40.088
I'M ON THE FENCE ON IT BECAUSE

03:11:40.155 --> 03:11:41.289
AND FLEW OVER THIS ISSUE

03:11:41.356 --> 03:11:42.624
BECAUSE I'M STUCK ON THAT

03:11:42.691 --> 03:11:45.026
BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE- LIKE

03:11:45.093 --> 03:11:46.394
THAT WOULD LIMITED MOSTLY TO

03:11:46.461 --> 03:11:48.797
PROFESSORS AND LAWYERS. AM I

03:11:48.864 --> 03:11:51.099

03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:17.225
MOST LOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF

03:12:17.292 --> 03:12:18.593

WORK ON THE DEFINITIONS I THINK

03:23:59.060 --> 03:23:59.760
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

03:23:59.827 --> 03:24:01.395
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED CLARITY IN

03:24:01.462 --> 03:24:02.296
WHAT IT IS ALLOWED AND NOT

03:24:02.363 --> 03:24:04.332
ALLOWED- MY- QUESTION THOUGH

03:24:04.398 --> 03:24:06.767
IS- FOR ALL THE PARENTS IN THE

03:24:06.834 --> 03:24:08.369
ROOM. YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THIS

03:24:08.436 --> 03:24:09.737
DANIEL TIGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD WAS

03:24:09.804 --> 03:24:11.505
A REGULAR IN MY HOUSE STILL

03:24:11.572 --> 03:24:12.607
REGULAR IN MY HOMEWORK IN

03:24:12.673 --> 03:24:14.175
YOURS. AND THERE'S A REALLY

03:24:14.241 --> 03:24:15.142
GOOD CONTENT ON THERE THAT

03:24:15.209 --> 03:24:16.377
ACTUALLY ROADS BULLYING TO

03:24:16.444 --> 03:24:18.446
TEACH THE KIDS RIGHT. TO SAY

03:24:18.512 --> 03:24:18.980
SOMETHING WHEN THEY SEE

03:24:19.046 --> 03:24:20.548
SOMETHING RIGHT AND SO I THINK

03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:21.582
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO

03:24:21.649 --> 03:24:22.817
ADDRESS SORT OF CONTENT THAT IS

03:24:22.883 --> 03:24:24.452
APPROPRIATELY TARGETED TO KIDS

03:24:24.518 --> 03:24:25.319
TO TEACH THEM ABOUT THESE

03:24:25.386 --> 03:24:29.256
THINGS- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:24:29.323 --> 03:24:29.857
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN

03:24:29.924 --> 03:24:30.658
BE ADDRESSED. IT'S AN EXCELLENT

03:24:30.725 --> 03:24:31.826
POINT. AND ONE THAT WE'RE

03:24:31.892 --> 03:24:33.160
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I MEAN I

03:24:33.227 --> 03:24:34.061
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

03:24:34.128 --> 03:24:36.831
BILL. IS USEFUL- I'M

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:37.932
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON YOU

03:24:37.999 --> 03:24:40.067
KNOW. THE AUTO PLAY A PIECE OF

03:24:40.134 --> 03:24:41.836
IT RIGHT WHERE. ANY OF US WHO

03:24:41.902 --> 03:24:44.071
ARE PARENTS. YOU GIVE YOUR KID

03:24:44.138 --> 03:24:44.839
YOUR PHONE THEY'RE WATCHING

03:24:44.905 --> 03:24:46.707
SOMETHING. THIRTY MINUTES LATER

03:24:46.774 --> 03:24:48.175
THEIR WATCHING SOMETHING

03:24:48.242 --> 03:24:50.878
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- SO THOSE.

03:24:50.945 --> 03:24:52.046
I THINK WE HAVE MORE SPACE AND

03:24:52.113 --> 03:24:53.180
UNDERSTANDING AROUND I THINK

03:24:53.247 --> 03:24:54.882
THE CONTENT PIECE IS THE MOST

03:24:54.949 --> 03:24:55.883
CHALLENGING PART OF THE BILL TO

03:24:55.950 --> 03:24:57.084
BE FRANK WITH YOU. IT'S WHAT

03:24:57.151 --> 03:24:58.986
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON-

03:24:59.053 --> 03:25:00.154
AND I'M VERY OPEN TO DOING

03:25:00.221 --> 03:25:01.789
THIS. IN A RIGHT IN THE RIGHT

03:25:01.856 --> 03:25:03.624
WAY AND WANT TO PRESENT A BILL

03:25:03.691 --> 03:25:04.625
HOPEFULLY ON THE FLOOR. THAT I

03:25:04.692 --> 03:25:06.027
THINK. GETS TO WHAT WE'RE

03:25:06.093 --> 03:25:07.495
TRYING TO DO IN A BETTER WAY.

03:25:07.561 --> 03:25:08.429
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:09.630
YOUR WORK ON THIS I MEAN AS A

03:25:09.697 --> 03:25:11.165
MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN. YOU

03:25:11.232 --> 03:25:12.233
KNOW THEY'RE AT THE AUTO PLAY

03:25:12.299 --> 03:25:13.401
FUNCTION IS SOMETHING THAT.

03:25:13.467 --> 03:25:14.869
MAKES ME NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN

03:25:14.935 --> 03:25:16.203
TO USE CERTAIN PLATFORMS YOU.

03:25:16.270 --> 03:25:17.505
SEEN IT HAPPEN RIGHT YOU YOU

03:25:17.571 --> 03:25:18.839
SORT OF APPROVE WHAT IT IS THEY

03:25:18.906 --> 03:25:19.907
WATCH AND THEN THE NEXT THING

03:25:19.974 --> 03:25:21.042
STARTS ROLLING AND IT'S-

03:25:21.108 --> 03:25:22.076
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:23.978
CONTACT RATE. AND IT'S I THINK

03:25:24.045 --> 03:25:25.980
IT'S A REALLY. ABUSIVE FUTURE

03:25:26.047 --> 03:25:27.114
ESPECIALLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE

03:25:27.181 --> 03:25:29.250
USING IT- SO I REALLY

03:25:29.316 --> 03:25:30.017
APPRECIATE THIS AND I THINK ALL

03:25:30.084 --> 03:25:33.254
OF US. YOUR POINT NEED.

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:34.622
CONTROLS AROUND ASK BECAUSE OUR

03:25:34.689 --> 03:25:36.223
KIDS ARE USING TECHNOLOGY IN A

03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:37.525
NEW WAY WE DID IT FOR

03:25:37.591 --> 03:25:38.826
TELEVISION TO YOUR POINT AND

03:25:38.893 --> 03:25:39.827
NOW THE- MOST KIDS AREN'T

03:25:39.894 --> 03:25:40.327
SITTING AROUND WATCHING

03:25:40.394 --> 03:25:41.762
TELEVISION ANYMORE RIGHT

03:25:41.829 --> 03:25:42.296
THEY'RE ENGAGING IN THESE

03:25:42.363 --> 03:25:43.764
PLATFORMS AND SO WE NEED TO BE.

03:25:43.831 --> 03:25:44.932
DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO

03:25:44.999 --> 03:25:46.067
ENSURE CHIDREN ARE PROPERLY

03:25:46.133 --> 03:25:50.304
PROTECTED- MY LAST QUESTION IS

03:25:50.371 --> 03:25:50.705
ON ENFORCEMENT. SO

03:25:50.771 --> 03:25:51.372
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A

03:25:51.439 --> 03:25:52.339
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

03:25:52.406 --> 03:25:53.908
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS IT'S LIMITED

03:25:53.974 --> 03:25:55.142
AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT A

03:25:55.209 --> 03:25:57.311
LITTLE FURTHER. AND SAID THAT

03:25:57.378 --> 03:25:58.779
THIS IS AN OPENING PLATFORM.

03:25:58.846 --> 03:26:00.347
TOURISTS FRAZIER AND I'LL JUST

03:26:00.414 --> 03:26:02.550
SAY- I'M OPEN TO RECONSIDERING

03:26:02.616 --> 03:26:04.085
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

03:26:04.151 --> 03:26:04.885
OKAY WE DO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

03:26:04.952 --> 03:26:06.320
THE FIFTH PERSON PIECE. YES AND

03:26:06.387 --> 03:26:07.655
I THINK IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT

03:26:07.722 --> 03:26:08.823
IS IMPORTANT I DON'T KNOW THAT.

03:26:08.889 --> 03:26:09.824
I MEAN I GUESS I DON'T KNOW

03:26:09.890 --> 03:26:11.225
ENOUGH ABOUT TV RICH FASHION

03:26:11.292 --> 03:26:12.193
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD

03:26:12.259 --> 03:26:13.694
BE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. YEAH

03:26:13.761 --> 03:26:14.662
WHERE IS THE ENFORCEMENT AND I

03:26:14.729 --> 03:26:16.097
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A

03:26:16.163 --> 03:26:17.498
ROBUST IMPORTS IN MAGAZINES.

03:26:17.565 --> 03:26:18.999
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM

03:26:19.066 --> 03:26:20.167
YOUR PRIVATE ACTION ACTUALLY

03:26:20.234 --> 03:26:21.302
ALSO DIDN'T PROVIDE FOR MUCH

03:26:21.368 --> 03:26:22.636
THAT WOULD. BE A MEANINGFUL

03:26:22.703 --> 03:26:23.904
ENFORCEMENT IS SORT OF A

03:26:23.971 --> 03:26:25.439
SEPARATE QUESTION SO I THINK.

03:26:25.506 --> 03:26:26.807
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK.

03:26:26.874 --> 03:26:27.875
THAT NEEDS GOOD ENFORCEMENT

03:26:27.942 --> 03:26:29.076
WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT WE

03:26:29.143 --> 03:26:30.945
DON'T HAVE SORT OF. LAWSUITS

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.346

03:27:54.795 --> 03:27:56.897
TALKED IN THE AND OBVIOUSLY-

03:27:56.964 --> 03:27:58.199
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S CLOSE

03:27:58.265 --> 03:27:59.533
TO MY HEART ABOUT INSURING THAT

03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:01.869
THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR USE-

03:28:01.936 --> 03:28:04.605
YOU HAD A- THE BILL. LAST YEAR

03:28:04.672 --> 03:28:08.008
REGARDING. RATTLE CONSENT FOR

03:28:08.075 --> 03:28:10.578
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS- AND A

03:28:10.644 --> 03:28:12.580
AND I THINK THIS IS ALONG THAT

03:28:12.646 --> 03:28:15.316
SAME SPIRIT- I WILL START ALL

03:28:15.382 --> 03:28:16.450
START WITH THIS MY FAVORITE

03:28:16.517 --> 03:28:20.287
PART OF THE BILL- IS. THIS THE

03:28:20.354 --> 03:28:22.122
LANGUAGES SAYS ANY DESIGN

03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:23.824
FEATURES SETTING THAT ALLOWS A

03:28:23.891 --> 03:28:26.861
COVERED USER TO MAKE PURCHASES.

03:28:26.927 --> 03:28:29.129
LIKE RIGHT A LOT- BECAUSE HE OF

03:28:29.196 --> 03:28:30.497
GOD KNOWS BILLS FROM LIKE WHERE

03:28:30.564 --> 03:28:32.333
IS THE THREE NINETY NINE COME

03:28:32.399 --> 03:28:35.302
FROM WHAT DID YOU BUY YEAH-

03:28:35.369 --> 03:28:37.404
AND- I THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE

03:28:37.471 --> 03:28:40.574
SOME SOME GROUND TYPE ARTICLES

03:28:40.641 --> 03:28:43.677
FOR ON THAT ONE. ON THAT- AND I

03:28:43.744 --> 03:28:45.112
AND I THINK LIKE IN JUNE THE

03:28:45.179 --> 03:28:46.580
CONCEPT HERE IS A GOOD ONE

03:28:46.647 --> 03:28:48.883
WHICH IS YOU KNOW A SPECIAL

03:28:48.949 --> 03:28:51.151
WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED IN ON.

03:28:51.218 --> 03:28:52.386
APPS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

03:28:52.453 --> 03:28:54.388
FOR KIDS RIGHT. BUT I THINK

03:28:54.455 --> 03:28:55.256
RIGHT NOW LANGUAGE DOESN'T

03:28:55.322 --> 03:28:57.424
QUITE CAPTURE THAT BECAUSE IT

03:28:57.491 --> 03:29:00.127
SAYS KIND OF COPY ANY CONTENT-

03:29:00.194 --> 03:29:01.662
ACTED TOWARDS KITTENS AND FACT

03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:02.963
I THINK IF MAYBE IF THERE'S A

03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:04.198
WAY TO TIGHTEN THAT THAT'S ONE.

03:29:04.265 --> 03:29:06.267
YEAH YEP ONE THING I THINKING

03:29:06.333 --> 03:29:07.835
ABOUT- AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:29:07.902 --> 03:29:10.137
YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT- AND

03:29:10.204 --> 03:29:12.206
THEN I THINK JUST THE

03:29:12.273 --> 03:29:14.208
DEFINITIONS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT

03:29:14.275 --> 03:29:16.277
WOULD CONSTITUTE- NO

03:29:16.343 --> 03:29:20.314
INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT- I THINK

03:29:20.381 --> 03:29:21.115
ON THE VIOLENCE LIKE WAS

03:29:21.181 --> 03:29:22.216
BROUGHT UP I MEAN WE'VE SEEN

03:29:22.283 --> 03:29:25.085
PLENTY OF CARTOONS DISNEY.

03:29:25.152 --> 03:29:26.754
CARTOONS IT MIGHT YOU KNOW

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:28.055
SOMEONE COULD SAY OR ARE

03:29:28.122 --> 03:29:30.357
VIOLENT RIGHT. BUT DON'T RISE

03:29:30.424 --> 03:29:32.059
TO THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE WE

03:29:32.126 --> 03:29:35.262
THINK WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE- I

03:29:35.329 --> 03:29:36.063
THINK THE CHALLENGE OF THIS

03:29:36.130 --> 03:29:37.197
BILL IS PICKING OUT LIKE HOW DO

03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:39.099
WE DETERMINE THAT I MEAN DO YOU

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:43.671
USE LIKE THE P. G. G. RADIANCE.

03:29:43.737 --> 03:29:46.607
AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING-

03:29:46.674 --> 03:29:49.843
ADULT ACTIVITIES. I'M NOT SURE

03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:51.879
LIKE WHAT THAT IS AT THIS POINT

03:29:51.946 --> 03:29:53.113
I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO

03:29:53.180 --> 03:29:54.248
GET OUT WITH THAT ONE AS WELL

03:29:54.315 --> 03:29:56.050
AS ADULT CONTENT YEAH I MEAN I

03:29:56.116 --> 03:29:58.018
THINK IT AND THIS IS ALL STILL

03:29:58.085 --> 03:29:59.219
LIKE I MEAN YOU'RE RAISING I

03:29:59.286 --> 03:30:00.087
THINK HONESTLY THE RIGHT

03:30:00.154 --> 03:30:01.889
QUESTIONS AND MAYBE THAT IS A

03:30:01.956 --> 03:30:03.123
WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT A

03:30:03.190 --> 03:30:05.526
P. G. G. COULD THAT BE IS AN

03:30:05.592 --> 03:30:08.095
APPARATUS THAT WE USE FOR THIS-

03:30:08.162 --> 03:30:09.897
I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

03:30:09.964 --> 03:30:11.765
MR GALLAGHER ON THIS- BUT I DO

03:30:11.832 --> 03:30:12.766
THINK IT'S WORTHY OF

03:30:12.833 --> 03:30:13.567
EXPLORATION AND TRYING TO

03:30:13.634 --> 03:30:17.304
FIGURE OUT- AND WANT TO DO THIS

03:30:17.371 --> 03:30:18.605
IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY THAT

03:30:18.672 --> 03:30:21.175
WE ARE ENSURING THAT OUR KIDS

03:30:21.241 --> 03:30:23.377
AND I I'M NOT I SHOULD ALSO SAY

03:30:23.444 --> 03:30:24.478
I'M NOT ONE THESE SORT OF LIKE

03:30:24.545 --> 03:30:27.047
PRUDISH TYPE PEOPLE- BUT I HAVE

03:30:27.114 --> 03:30:28.549
A FOUR YEAR OLDS RIGHT AND SHE

USES MY PHONE AND WE START

03:30:30.517 --> 03:30:31.919
SOMETHING WE END UP IN A VERY

03:30:31.986 --> 03:30:34.054
DIFFERENT PLACE- SO I'M

03:30:34.121 --> 03:30:35.422
GRAPPLING TO WITH HOW DO YOU

03:30:35.489 --> 03:30:37.758
CREATE A POLICY THAT ENABLES

03:30:37.825 --> 03:30:39.927
YOU TO PROTECT YOUR KIDS. AND

03:30:39.994 --> 03:30:41.328
ENSURE THAT THEIR VIEWING THE

03:30:41.395 --> 03:30:42.463
CONTENT THAT YOU THINK IS

03:30:42.529 --> 03:30:45.232
SUITABLE FOR THEM- AND GIVE

03:30:45.299 --> 03:30:47.434
PARENTS THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL

03:30:47.501 --> 03:30:50.137
RIGHT WITHOUT- YOU KNOW HAVING

03:30:50.204 --> 03:30:52.039
SORT OF A NANNY STATE SORT OF

03:30:52.106 --> 03:30:53.640
BILL RIGHT SO THOSE ARE THE

03:30:53.707 --> 03:30:55.142
THINGS I'M I'M GRAPPLING WITH

03:30:55.209 --> 03:30:56.677
BUT I'M I'M COMMITTED TO SORT

03:30:56.744 --> 03:30:57.511
OF SING IT THROUGH AND TO

03:30:57.578 --> 03:30:59.213
WORKING WITH. BOTH THE

03:30:59.279 --> 03:31:00.981
OPPOSITION AND ANYONE HERE ON

HOW WE THINK WE CAN DO THAT. SO

03:31:05.753 --> 03:31:09.256
AND- AB GRAPPLED WITH THE SAME

03:31:09.323 --> 03:31:11.191
THING SO I GUESS MY QUESTION MY

03:31:11.258 --> 03:31:12.893
A MAYBE A PLAN LAST QUESTION

03:31:12.960 --> 03:31:14.061
FOR YOU AND MAYBE FOR THE UP

03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:15.896
ANYBODY ON THE OPPOSITION WANTS

TO TRY AND ANSWER THIS. YOU

03:31:18.465 --> 03:31:19.500

03:31:19.566 --> 03:31:21.268
OPPOSITION ABOUT HOW HOW THEY

03:31:21.335 --> 03:31:23.937
COULD DO THAT FOR THEIR UNDER

03:31:24.004 --> 03:31:25.305
THIRTEEN APPS YEAH I MEAN WE'VE

03:31:25.372 --> 03:31:27.408
HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT

03:31:27.474 --> 03:31:29.009
HAVE BEEN PRETTY PRODUCTIVE AND

03:31:29.076 --> 03:31:30.144
I THINK WE'LL- AND WE'LL

03:31:30.210 --> 03:31:32.312
CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND MAY

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:33.814
HAVE TO. MORE NARROWLY FOCUSED

03:31:33.881 --> 03:31:35.682
THE BILL YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON

03:31:35.749 --> 03:31:39.019
KIND OF WHERE WE LAND. FOR A-

03:31:39.086 --> 03:31:40.154
AND OUT OF THE OPPOSITION WANTS

03:31:40.220 --> 03:31:41.388

TO BEAT PEOPLE CONTENT ON IT

03:31:42.856 --> 03:31:44.458
LIKE IF YOU START OFF ON THAT

03:31:44.525 --> 03:31:48.128
APP AND IT THAT CONTENT IS OKAY

03:31:48.195 --> 03:31:49.863
BUT THEN WHY IS IT THAT YOU'RE

RIGHT AND HOW COULD THAT MAY BE

03:31:56.370 --> 03:31:58.338
FIXED BY THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE I

03:31:58.405 --> 03:32:00.007
MEAN I THINK MY ONE QUESTION WE

03:32:00.074 --> 03:32:02.709
SHOULD ALWAYS ASK IS A INDUSTRY

03:32:02.776 --> 03:32:04.611
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS. SO YOU CAN

03:32:04.678 --> 03:32:06.480

PARENTS. YEAH YOU KNOW AS THE

03:32:09.616 --> 03:32:11.618
AS A CONSUMER AS WELL. AS

03:32:11.685 --> 03:32:12.753
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WANTING

03:32:12.820 --> 03:32:14.188
THEIR KIDS TO BE A CONSUMER OF

03:32:14.254 --> 03:32:16.356
CERTAIN THINGS. RIGHT I MEAN

MINUTES LATER SHE'S WATCHING

03:32:22.162 --> 03:32:23.797
LIKE SKITTLES BEING PICKED UP

03:32:23.864 --> 03:32:24.932
AND PUT FROM A CUP TO A BALL

03:32:24.998 --> 03:32:25.866
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH

03:32:25.933 --> 03:32:27.534

THINK THAT'S WHERE THE STOPPING

03:32:33.874 --> 03:32:34.541
OF AUTO PLAY IS ACTUALLY REALLY

03:32:34.608 --> 03:32:37.344
IMPORTANT- WHICH IS IN THE BILL

03:32:37.411 --> 03:32:38.011
I THINK THAT THERE ARE

03:32:38.078 --> 03:32:38.745
QUESTIONS AROUND THE

03:32:38.812 --> 03:32:39.880
DEFINITIONS OF LIKE THE SOME OF

03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:40.848
THE CONTENT PIECE THAT YOU'RE

03:32:40.914 --> 03:32:42.516

MY THOUGHTS ON THE THERE'S SORT

03:32:56.430 --> 03:32:59.199
OF TWO COMPONENTS OF THE BILL

03:32:59.266 --> 03:33:00.300
AS STANDS NOW THAT I THINK ARE

03:33:00.367 --> 03:33:02.136
EXCELLENT THAT WOULD GIVE

03:33:02.202 --> 03:33:03.904
PARENTS MORE CONTROL AND

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:05.739
PROTECT KIDS AND THAT'S THE

03:33:05.806 --> 03:33:07.941
AUTO PLATE OF PORTION OF THE

03:33:08.008 --> 03:33:10.110
BILL AND THE PROTECTION ON THE

03:33:10.177 --> 03:33:12.012

03:33:21.688 --> 03:33:24.024
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS WHICH IS

03:33:24.091 --> 03:33:25.692
NOT A GOOD PRACTICE MIGHT BE.

03:33:25.759 --> 03:33:28.295
ARGUABLY SHOULDN'T BE LEGAL- SO

03:33:28.362 --> 03:33:29.897
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK

03:33:29.963 --> 03:33:30.964
THOSE ARE GREAT AND THE AUTO

03:33:31.031 --> 03:33:32.466

THING GOES FOR THIRTY MINUTES

03:33:42.776 --> 03:33:44.278

ACCEPTABLE LIST AND

03:33:51.418 --> 03:33:52.219
UNACCEPTABLE LIST AND THE

03:33:52.286 --> 03:33:54.188
PARENTS HAD THE ABILITY TO

03:33:54.254 --> 03:33:55.289
MONITOR THAT AND NOW IT DOESN'T

03:33:55.355 --> 03:33:56.857
WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE- THE

03:33:56.924 --> 03:33:58.492
THING LEADS TO SOMETHING ELSE

03:33:58.559 --> 03:33:59.526

CLEARLY WE ARE AGING OURSELVES.

03:35:57.077 --> 03:35:58.345
HOWEVER IT'S INCREDIBLY

03:35:58.412 --> 03:35:59.646
IMPORTANT WHICH HAS NO IDEA

03:35:59.713 --> 03:36:03.850
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND

03:36:03.917 --> 03:36:07.854
THE MINUTE IN THE MUSEUM NOW-

03:36:07.921 --> 03:36:09.556
BUT BUT THANK YOU I THINK A WE

03:36:09.623 --> 03:36:11.525
GREW UP VERY DIFFERENTLY AND WE

03:36:11.591 --> 03:36:12.626
ARE NOW IN A VERY DIFFERENT

03:36:12.693 --> 03:36:14.094
SPACE IN WHICH WE HAVE TO

03:36:14.161 --> 03:36:16.463
DEFINE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MY

03:36:16.530 --> 03:36:18.432
PARENTS WERE VERY STRICT I HAD

03:36:18.498 --> 03:36:20.367
ONE HOUR OF TELEVISION SO I WAS

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:23.036
VERY CAREFUL AND- VERY PICKY

03:36:23.103 --> 03:36:24.171
ABOUT THE CARTOONS THAT I WOULD

03:36:24.237 --> 03:36:25.772
WATCH- AND AFTER THAT IT WAS

03:36:25.839 --> 03:36:26.740
LIKE HOMEWORK AND READING AND

03:36:26.807 --> 03:36:28.275
PLAYING OUTSIDE AND IT'S- WE

03:36:28.342 --> 03:36:29.743
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR KIDS

03:36:29.810 --> 03:36:32.446
NOW IT'S VERY DIFFERENT- MY-

03:36:32.512 --> 03:36:33.547
CHIEF OF STAFF WAS LETTING ME

03:36:33.613 --> 03:36:35.882
KNOW THAT. HER NEPHEW WAS

03:36:35.949 --> 03:36:37.951
WATCHING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ON

03:36:38.018 --> 03:36:39.453
HOW TO DESTROY TOYS AND STARTED

03:36:39.519 --> 03:36:40.821
FLUSHING THEM DOWN THE TOILET

03:36:40.887 --> 03:36:43.323
COSTING THE FAMILY THOUSANDS

03:36:43.390 --> 03:36:44.491
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF

03:36:44.558 --> 03:36:46.259
REPAIR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE WAS

03:36:46.326 --> 03:36:48.562
NO WAY TO CONTROL THAT SO I

03:36:48.628 --> 03:36:49.896
WANT TO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND

03:36:49.963 --> 03:36:50.497
YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

03:36:50.564 --> 03:36:51.898
BEEN DOING AND I KNOW THAT

03:36:51.965 --> 03:36:52.666
YOU'RE GOING TO LAND IN A IN A

03:36:52.733 --> 03:36:54.534
GOOD PLACE. ON THIS BILL AND

03:36:54.601 --> 03:36:56.303
IT'S WE'RE IN A VERY DIFFERENT

03:36:56.370 --> 03:36:58.672
SPACE IN WHICH WE ARE IN A NEW

03:36:58.739 --> 03:36:59.306
WORLD THAT HAVE TO WE HAVE TO

03:36:59.373 --> 03:37:02.409
DEFINE WHAT TECHNOLOGY AN AXIS

03:37:02.476 --> 03:37:03.910
LOOKS LIKE AND THIS IS THE

03:37:03.977 --> 03:37:05.979
APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO SO THIS

03:37:06.046 --> 03:37:08.648
IS COMPLETELY- BUT A DIFFERENT

03:37:08.715 --> 03:37:10.350
SPACE BUT I HAD THIS IDEA AS

03:37:10.417 --> 03:37:12.018
WELL THAT WHILE PARENTS ARE

03:37:12.085 --> 03:37:13.553
ALSO TRYING TO REGULATE WHAT

03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:15.655
CHILDREN DO ON. ON THEIR

03:37:15.722 --> 03:37:17.758
DIGITAL DEVICES I'VE ALSO

03:37:17.824 --> 03:37:19.092
BECOME VERY CONCERNED WITH WHAT

03:37:19.159 --> 03:37:20.694
PARENTS DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN

03:37:20.761 --> 03:37:22.229
ON DIGITAL DEVICES AND POSTING

03:37:22.295 --> 03:37:23.864
PHOTOS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN

03:37:23.930 --> 03:37:25.432
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN

03:37:25.499 --> 03:37:26.800
THEY GET OLDER THEY HAVE NO

03:37:26.867 --> 03:37:27.734
CONTROL OF THEIR DIGITAL

03:37:27.801 --> 03:37:29.669
IDENTITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING

03:37:29.736 --> 03:37:31.304
ELSE THAT I THINK AS PARENTS

03:37:31.371 --> 03:37:33.306
ALSO SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER

03:37:33.373 --> 03:37:34.341
IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THE

03:37:34.408 --> 03:37:35.175
FUTURE LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS

03:37:35.242 --> 03:37:37.010
THE IMPACT. THAT SHARING THOSE

03:37:37.077 --> 03:37:38.979
PHOTOS OF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

03:37:39.045 --> 03:37:40.947
SEEM VERY INNOCENT THAT LATER

03:37:41.014 --> 03:37:42.883
ON IN LIFE WHEN THAT CHILD IS

03:37:42.949 --> 03:37:44.050
AN ADULT THAT PHOTO HAS BEEN

03:37:44.117 --> 03:37:45.752
OUT THERE AND THEY HAVE NO

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:48.688
CONTROL OVER THERE THE DIGITAL-

03:37:48.755 --> 03:37:49.923
IDENTITY SO I HOPE THAT'S

03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.757
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU AND I

03:37:50.824 --> 03:37:52.826
CAN WORK ON ON IN THE FUTURE

03:37:52.893 --> 03:37:53.927

03:37:59.065 --> 03:38:00.367
PHOTOS OF MY CHILDREN BUT

03:38:00.434 --> 03:38:01.334
ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC FIGURE

03:38:01.401 --> 03:38:02.869
I'M MOR MORE MINDFUL OF WHAT

03:38:02.936 --> 03:38:07.474
THAT MEANS- BUT WE ARE IN THIS

03:38:07.541 --> 03:38:08.041
SORT OF NEW WORLD ORDER- AND

03:38:08.108 --> 03:38:08.642
THIS. SPACE IN SO I THINK WE

03:38:08.708 --> 03:38:09.409
HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE IN

03:38:09.476 --> 03:38:11.411
CALIFORNIA TO HELP DEFINE. WHAT

03:38:11.478 --> 03:38:12.813
THAT CAN LOOK LIKE NOT JUST FOR

03:38:12.879 --> 03:38:13.647

THERE'S LIKE A LONGER LIST OF

03:39:32.859 --> 03:39:34.094

DEFINED SELVES FOR. ADVERTISER

03:39:36.363 --> 03:39:37.864
FRIENDLY CONTENT AND EVEN

CREATE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE SO

03:39:39.132 --> 03:39:41.568
PERHAPS IF THEY HAVE. IF THEY

03:39:41.635 --> 03:39:43.570
HAVE ISSUES WITH HOW BROAD OUR

03:39:43.637 --> 03:39:45.205
DEFINITION IS IN THE BILL MAYBE

03:39:45.272 --> 03:39:45.772

DEFINITIONS THAT THE CREATED.

03:39:47.407 --> 03:39:48.875

ALREADY FACE BACKLASH FOR MANY

03:39:50.310 --> 03:39:51.278

DID SOMETHING THEY KNOW IS A

03:40:05.625 --> 03:40:07.394
PROBLEM. AND SO I REALLY HOPE

03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:08.261
THAT THE OPPOSITION TO WORKING

03:40:08.328 --> 03:40:09.963
