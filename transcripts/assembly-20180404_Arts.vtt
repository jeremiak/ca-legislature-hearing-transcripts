00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:44.795 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY ONE TEN BECAUSE OUR

ATHLETIC TRAINER THERE IS FAR

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:49.166 region:rollup2
MORE LENIENT THAN THAT OF OTHER

THIS LEVEL POSITION OVERSIGHT IS

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:06.283 region:rollup2
VASTLY MORE LENIENT IN ATHLETIC

IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL

BEING OF OUR ATHLETES.

00:58:28.405 --> 00:58:30.140 region:rollup2

RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT PUBLIC

THERE TRYING TO CALIFORNIA.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.459 region:rollup2
THIS ALONE IS A REASONABLE

00:58:47.491 --> 00:58:51.395 region:rollup2
SOLUTION THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY

PAST ON.

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.176 region:rollup2
ON.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.744 region:rollup2
TITLE PROTECTION AND

THEY HAVE.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.817 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP A SCOPE BILLS. BUT

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.985 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY ONE TEN IS.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:23.920 region:rollup2
.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:25.589 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR'S VERSION AS WELL AS

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.457 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR'S ARE BILL FIFTEEN OF

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:30.260 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN TEN.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
HAS PROVISIONS IN IT THAT ARE A.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.097 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC FOR OCCUPATIONAL

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.699 region:rollup2
THERAPY AND THAT IS THAT THEY.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.434 region:rollup2
THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS WOULD LIKE

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.768 region:rollup2
TO PUT THEIR THEIR SELVES UNDER

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:40.303 region:rollup2
THE BOARD CALIFORNIA BOARD OF

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:42.772 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:44.808 region:rollup2
WE VIEW THIS AS A VERY

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:47.811 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE COMPLETELY

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:50.313 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EDUCATION TRAINING.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:51.481 region:rollup2
OF FIELD WORK REQUIREMENTS

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:53.116 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DIFFERENT PATIENT

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.452 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:56.486 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT SEE A SYNERGY BETWEEN

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:58.288 region:rollup2
ATHLETIC TRAINING AND

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:01.191 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:01:02.826 region:rollup2
AND I QUITE FRANKLY LAST YEAR OF

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:04.594 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FEE

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.129 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT WAS IMPOSED ON ALL

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:07.764 region:rollup2
ARM OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OVER

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:09.366 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THOUSAND LICENSED IN THE

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:13.203 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:14.404 region:rollup2
FOR A UNDER THE GUISE THAT THE.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:15.772 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:18.642 region:rollup2
NEEDED JUST TO HANDLE THE

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:19.876 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD OF THE OVERSIGHT OF

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:21.645 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SO WE

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:22.846 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE FOCUS

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:24.948 region:rollup2
FOR THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:27.350 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. NEEDS TO

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:29.653 region:rollup2
BE ON OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:31.621 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IF

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:34.090 region:rollup2
THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS A CONTINUE

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:36.326 region:rollup2
TO SEEK A LICENSURE VERSUS A

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.060 region:rollup2
TITLE PROTECTION CERTIFICATION

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:39.396 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.096 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE THEIR

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.098 region:rollup2
OWN BOARD PERHAPS.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:44.234 region:rollup2
BE UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.835 region:rollup2
SINCE THEY REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:48.405 region:rollup2
SUPERVISION IN THEIR OWN BILL.

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:49.339 region:rollup2
BUT WE JUST DO NOT FEEL THAT

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:50.440 region:rollup2
THE BOOK.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:52.008 region:rollup2
THEIR FEARS IS WHERE THEY SHOULD

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.643 region:rollup2
BE ARM WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.211 region:rollup2
WITH SCOPE AS WELL BUT I WON'T

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:56.446 region:rollup2
REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:58.114 region:rollup2
SAID.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.616 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST COMMENT ON ONE

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:02.319 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:03.887 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT IN REGARDS TO.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:05.522 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR HAVING ATHLETIC

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.890 region:rollup2
TRAINERS AT HIGH SCHOOLS AND

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:08.124 region:rollup2
SPORTING EVENTS

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.659 region:rollup2
WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:10.160 region:rollup2
WITH THAT BUT THAT IS A

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:12.229 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.331 region:rollup2
ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED THAT

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.565 region:rollup2
ISN'T THAT. IS THE ISSUE OF

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
HAVING AN ATHLETIC TRAINER

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:19.469 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AT SPORTING EVENTS IS

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.737 region:rollup2
A GOOD ISSUE TO TO HAVE. AS GOOD

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.372 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION TO HAVE.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.672 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT HOW DO WE

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.274 region:rollup2
MANDATE IT?

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.642 region:rollup2
?

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:26.977 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.877 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:30.146 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE THAT WE'RE

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:31.982 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WILLING TO ENGAGE IN.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.616 region:rollup2
BUT NOT UNDER THAT NOT NOT IF

TOPIC MOVE THROUGH.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.278 region:rollup2

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.349 region:rollup2
BEING CONSIDERED BUT I WAS

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.784 region:rollup2
WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TO MOVE IT

THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:35.198 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT CERTAINLY ON

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:38.001 region:rollup2

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.774 region:rollup2
WE'LL RESERVE FOR MY PERSPECTIVE

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.508 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT BUT BUT I DO THINK

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:47.510 region:rollup2
A IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:49.012 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND. HAVE

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.346 region:rollup2
ALL OUR COLLEAGUES TICKET ON I

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:50.947 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF FUN FATE THAT

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:57.787 region:rollup2

THANK YOU WITH THE CHAIR.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:03.560 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS SINCE I

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.793 region:rollup2
KNOW WE JUST SAW THIS BILL

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.262 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:07.464 region:rollup2
.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER THAT

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:10.633 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:12.368 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S THE ONLY STATE THAT

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
DOES NOT REGULATE PROFESSIONAL

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:15.805 region:rollup2
ATHLETIC TRAINING.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.774 region:rollup2
SO.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.442 region:rollup2
WATER THE OTHER STATES DOING I

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:21.044 region:rollup2
MEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ALL

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:23.179 region:rollup2
UNIQUE. IN THE WAY THEY LOOK AT

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:27.383 region:rollup2
IT BUT.

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:29.819 region:rollup2
WISE CALIFORNIA NOT AND. HOW DID

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:31.020 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW? YOU LOOK THERE IS A A

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.888 region:rollup2
BIT OF A PATCHWORK QUILT I'M

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.691 region:rollup2
GONNA REFER TO DEFER TO MY AYE

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:36.359 region:rollup2
EXPERT ON THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.026 region:rollup2
THOUGH WHEN OUT LIAR.

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.928 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE OTHER FORTY NINE

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:40.697 region:rollup2
IN NO REAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:42.365 region:rollup2
OF ANY.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.733 region:rollup2
KIND SO WE DO SET OURSELVES

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:45.702 region:rollup2
APART.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:47.604 region:rollup2
WE DISTINGUISH OURSELVES. IN A

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.271 region:rollup2
IN A NEGATIVE WAY AS FAR AS I'M

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.405 region:rollup2
CONCERNED I'M GOING ALLOW MIKE'S

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:51.574 region:rollup2
IS HARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:53.943 region:rollup2
ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THAT NATIONAL

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:55.912 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE OUT LOOKS LIKE.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:58.214 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF STATES ARE

01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:59.816 region:rollup2
LICENSURE. OVER FORTY I DON'T

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:00.416 region:rollup2
KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF TOP OF

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:02.018 region:rollup2
MY HEAD.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:03.586 region:rollup2
BY THINK IT'S FORTY THREE OR

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.121 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:07.423 region:rollup2
STATES THAT ARE. CALLED

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:09.926 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION. OR CERTIFICATION

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:12.328 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:14.030 region:rollup2
LICENSURE WITHOUT PROTECTION

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:15.098 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF PRACTICE ABOARD AN

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.934 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:18.801 region:rollup2
MINNESOTA HAS REGISTRATION

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:22.205 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:23.273 region:rollup2
OF MOVING TOWARDS LICENSURE AND

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.074 region:rollup2
THEY'VE PASSED THROUGH THE

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:26.309 region:rollup2
SENATE AND AROUND. IN THE OTHER

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:28.878 region:rollup2
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:30.713 region:rollup2
SO MOST STATES AGAIN ARE.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:32.815 region:rollup2
LICENSED OR SOMETHING THAT'S

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:34.517 region:rollup2
AKIN TO LICENSURE.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:35.485 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE THIS I MEAN AS A

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.654 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP.

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:39.289 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:41.057 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW ONE WHO IS

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:43.126 region:rollup2
BEING SAID IS THEY MEAN THEY

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:45.428 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN OVERSIGHT THEY MAY

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:47.130 region:rollup2
NEED. ARM TO DEAL WITH THEY DO

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.363 region:rollup2
NEED TO DEAL WITH THE SCOPE

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:50.133 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:52.101 region:rollup2
I MEAN IS THIS.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:53.536 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP THAT. YOU SEE

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:56.005 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:57.073 region:rollup2
EVOLVE INTO THAT.

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:59.175 region:rollup2
WELL I DON'T WANT TO.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:00.877 region:rollup2
NARROW THE BILL ANYWAY AT THIS

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
POINT I THINK A MY COLLEAGUES I

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:04.914 region:rollup2
HAVE INDICATED WE WILL BE

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:06.449 region:rollup2
DELVING DEEP INTO THESE SCOPE

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:09.185 region:rollup2
THAT DISCUSSIONS AT BUSINESS AND

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:10.753 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS.

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:12.121 region:rollup2
BAH I A WELCOME A ROBUST A

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.723 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ON THAT ON HOW WE

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:14.023 region:rollup2
CAN PROPERLY SET UP THE

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:15.191 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:16.559 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:20.063 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT.

COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.930 region:rollup2
A RECENT STUDY REVEALED THAT

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.564 region:rollup2
SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COLLEGE

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup2
ATHLETES SUSTAIN A MAJOR COLLEGE

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:31.734 region:rollup2
SPORTS INJURY.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.401 region:rollup2

ATHLETES WILL SUFFER FROM

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES.

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:37.139 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE WHY SOME OF THE

HEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.109 region:rollup2

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:44.447 region:rollup2
EACH OF THESE INJURIES COMES

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:46.449 region:rollup2
WITH A CHOICE OF PAYING FOR THE

01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:47.049 region:rollup2
COST FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURES.

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:48.884 region:rollup2

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:51.487 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.755 region:rollup2
RISKS AND COLLEGE SPORTS BECAUSE

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.423 region:rollup2
ATHLETES ARE TOO OFTEN PRESSURE

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:54.957 region:rollup2
TO PLAY WITH SERIOUS INJURIES.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:57.059 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN INCREASE MEDICAL

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:58.327 region:rollup2
EXPENSES.

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.428 region:rollup2
SPORTS RELATED INJURIES HAVE A

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.997 region:rollup2

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.497 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE IMPACT.

SURGERY AS WELL AS CONCUSSIONS

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.338 region:rollup2

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:14.010 region:rollup2
AND UNDER NCAA RULES COLLEGES

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.044 region:rollup2
CAN REFUSE TO RENEW AN ATHLETIC

OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.467 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COLLEGES HAVE RAISED

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:39.235 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MUCH WOULD

PERCENT.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.752 region:rollup2
THESE COLLEGES CAN AFFORD TO

TREATING OUR STUDENTS AND THE

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:37.419 region:rollup2
SUPPORT WE PROVIDE FOR THEM.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.554 region:rollup2
I AM UNFORTUNATELY FIRST I'D

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.689 region:rollup2
LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:42.191 region:rollup2
THE BILL MAKES REFERENCE TO THE

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.459 region:rollup2
NC DOUBLE WAY. NOT NUMBER

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:44.827 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS PLAY IN THE NC

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:46.829 region:rollup2
DOUBLE A.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:48.130 region:rollup2
EFFECTS SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.265 region:rollup2
PLAY IN THE M. EIGHT I A. THE

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.199 region:rollup2
SMALLEST OF THEM HAS A HUNDRED

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:53.202 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE STUDENTS.

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:53.769 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S TOTAL.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:55.104 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT OR SHOOT UP THE

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:56.605 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:58.674 region:rollup2
AND SO OF THIS BILL ACTUALLY

01:17:56.605 --> 01:18:00.075 region:rollup2
IMPOSES SEEM REQUIREMENTS ON THE

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.676 region:rollup2
ANYWAY SCHOOLS THAN IT DOES ON

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.711 region:rollup2
THE NC DOUBLE EIGHT SCHOOLS.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:05.047 region:rollup2
AND SO I.

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:06.315 region:rollup2
WE TAKE ISSUE WITH IMPOSING

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.849 region:rollup2
THOSE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:07.783 region:rollup2
INTENSELY CHOSE TO PLAN A

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.085 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WHICH.

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:12.388 region:rollup2
SECONDLY.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:14.123 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS RELATED TO.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:16.458 region:rollup2
THE MULTI YEAR SCHOLARSHIP

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:17.693 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.861 region:rollup2
WHILE DIVISION ONE MAY CHOOSE

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.062 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS THEY'RE

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.797 region:rollup2
NOT REQUIRED TO THIS EXPERIENCE

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:23.499 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:24.733 region:rollup2
TWO INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:26.235 region:rollup2
MEDIA REVENUE. THERE WAS A

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:28.204 region:rollup2
REFERENCE MADE TO REVENUES

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:29.438 region:rollup2
GENERATED BY SPORTS.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.373 region:rollup2
WE ALSO INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:33.309 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND EXPENSES.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.577 region:rollup2
IN ONE CASE TICKET SALES WAS

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.912 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND BUT INSTITUTIONS

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:37.479 region:rollup2
BENDS OVER TWO MILLION.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:39.848 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER PENDING WHAT'S

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:40.583 region:rollup2
FUNDRAISE BY THE INSTITUTION.

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.318 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE REVENUE CAME

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:44.253 region:rollup2
FROM. ANSWER TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:45.955 region:rollup2
THIS INCREASES THE COST ON THE

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:47.289 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.524 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT ADDITIONAL

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:50.626 region:rollup2
FUNDRAISING HAS TO HAPPEN.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:51.760 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:53.362 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.397 region:rollup2
HAS TO HELP

01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:56.498 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TWO PROGRAMS

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.032 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THAT GENERATE

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:58.267 region:rollup2
REVENUE IN THE TEND TO BE

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:59.501 region:rollup2
FOOTBALL.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:01.670 region:rollup2
AND MEN'S BASKETBALL.

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.040 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE ALREADY

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:06.809 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH THE FUND RAISING

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.011 region:rollup2
FOR STERN ATHLETICS.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:10.579 region:rollup2
THIS IMPOSES ADDITIONAL COSTS ON

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:11.880 region:rollup2
THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND OBVIOUSLY

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:14.283 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR XIN SO WE

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.883 region:rollup2
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. BUT WE DO

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:17.987 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS FOR A

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:17.987 region:rollup2
REASON.

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:20.956 region:rollup2
IT WERE TO BE REPLACED THERE'S A

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.758 region:rollup2
COMMON MISCONCEPTION

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:24.293 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FOR OUR SECTOR.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.861 region:rollup2
THAT WERE FLUSH WITH CASH IN

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.496 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:28.731 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:31.033 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER INSTITUTIONS ALREADY

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:33.502 region:rollup2
HAVE UNMET FINANCIAL AID NEED.

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.837 region:rollup2
AND SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:36.038 region:rollup2
