THAT.

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:19.284
BUT YET MEMBERS WE DO OPPOSE

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.752
THIS TAX AUTHORIZATION BILL AS

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.621
WE'VE OPPOSE ALL SORTS OF OTHER

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:24.022
TAX AUTHORIZATION BELLS

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:25.290
CERTAINLY IN THE TWELVE YEARS

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.026
THAT I'VE BEEN AT HOWARD JARVIS --

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.761
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON SALES TAX

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:31.897
INCREASES EVEN THE QUARTER CENT

00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:33.565
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.300
ARE INCREDIBLY REGRESSIVE.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:39.204
AND YOU KNOW ADDS TO THE BURDEN

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.739
THAT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS PAY

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.240
CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY HAS THE

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.042
HIGHEST SALES TAX IN THE NATION

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.243
BY FAR IN THE CITY OF SCOTTS

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.145
VALLEY ALREADY HAS A SALES TAX

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.079
INCREASE.

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:49.948
RATE OF 9% AND TO PUT THAT

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.750
FIGURE IN PERSPECTIVE THAT TAX

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:54.386
RATE IS ALREADY IN THE TOP 20%.

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:56.788
OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.423
LOCAL CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.791
THAT LEVY SALES TAXES SO SCOTTS

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:01.660
VALLEY ALREADY HAS.

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:02.427
A SALES TAX THAT CERTAINLY

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.696
HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE IN

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:07.599
A THINK ADDING TO THAT -- EVEN

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.500
THOUGH THE REASONS MAY WELL BE

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:10.669
THE ALLIED IS INAPPROPRIATE I

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:12.704
WOULD ALSO SAY TO MEMBERS JUST

00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:14.139
IN CLOSING THE BRADLEY BURNS

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:16.174
SALES TAX ACT HAS BEEN AROUND

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.043
SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX AND

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:19.244
WHAT THAT DID WAS SET A UNIFORM

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:20.478
SALES TAX RATE.

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:23.214
OF 2% ACROSS ALL MUNICIPALITIES

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:24.749
WE DO THINK THIS IS A FAIR SALES

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:27.052
TAX RATE IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:29.454
DECADES -- IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:30.922
EXCEED THE RATE I MEAN AGAIN

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.691
IT'S BEEN AROUND FIFTY YEARS WHY

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:33.591
DO WE NEED TO EXCEED THEIR EIGHT

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:34.826
YET WE SEE ALSO ITS

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.628
MUNICIPALITIES DOING THIS.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:37.796
AND IN FACT THE REASON WHY THIS

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:38.797
BILL NEEDS TO COME BEFORE THE

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:41.166
LEGISLATURE TODAY IS BECAUSE

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.801
WE'RE EXCEEDING THAT BRADLEY

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:45.103
BURNS 2% RATE -- DON'T THINK

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:51.743
IT'S NECESSARY SO FOR ALL THESE

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.645
REASONS WOULD ASK FOR AN OF A

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:54.145
ADDITIONAL IN THIS IS IN

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.880
OPPOSITION.

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:56.915
SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.149

START WORK.

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:00.685
YEAH I THINK LOCAL FOLKS SHOULD

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:01.686
BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:03.421
TAX RATES GOING TO BE AND I'D BE

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:05.790

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:21.239
LEVERS FOR CITIES LOCAL

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:24.009

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.112
A VERY EFFECTIVE CITY LIKE

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.513
SCOTTS VALLEY VERY FISCALLY

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.581
PRUDENT CITY LIKES LIKES CUTS

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.349
BELLY IS REALLY RUNNING OUT OF

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:32.717
OPTIONS BECAUSE OF THE

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.285
INEQUITIES OF THE PROPERTY TAX

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.387
SYSTEM.

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:36.821
AND THE THE LACK OF BALANCE

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:40.125
THERE IN FACT THE 9% RATE IF WE

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:41.860
ACTUALLY APPLIED SALES AND USE

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:43.028
TAX.

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:45.196
EQUITABLY ACROSS THE ECONOMY WE

00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:47.032
WOULD BE TAXING SERVICES A COULD

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.066
SIGNIFICANTLY DROPPED THE RIGHT

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.268
SO TO BE FOCUSING ON A 9% RATE

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.170
WHEN WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.371
ON IS THE BASE OF A WHICH THAT

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:54.472
IS APPLIED.

EXEMPTION ON A LIMITED FIVE YEAR

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.188

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.190
WITH ME TO MY RIGHT IS MY FRIEND

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.725
ALEX BILL KANA HE'S A DISTILLER

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.026
MY DISTRICT IN THESE HERE TO

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:30.461

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:32.029

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:34.398
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.501
THANK YOU.

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.602
MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE THANK YOU

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.736
FOR AT FIRST TAKE TAKING A LOOK

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.004
AT THIS BILL -- I'VE BEEN A

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:40.938
DISTILLER AND A WINE MAKER AND

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.940
THAT THE PASTOR WAS REGION FOR

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.609
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:45.510
ORIGINALLY WHEN I STARTED MAKING

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.345
WINE BARRELS WERE TAXED AND THEY

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:47.979
WEREN'T LOOKED AT AS AN

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.647
INGREDIENT THEY WERE LOOKED AT

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:50.848
AS A STORAGE CONTAINER.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.316
AND THE REALITY IS OAK BARRELS

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:53.985
ARE HORRIBLE STORAGE CONTAINERS

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:55.686
BECAUSE THEY LEAK BUGS EAT THEM

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:57.622
THEY GO BAD.

00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:58.189
I STAINLESS STEEL IS A MUCH

00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:58.890
BETTER OPTION.

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:00.391
AND SO IT WAS CLARIFIED A NUMBER

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:02.460
OF YEARS BACK THAT WINE WAS

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:03.594
ACTUALLY AN INGREDIENT EVERYBODY

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.329
TALKS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S OKEY

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:05.830
CHARDONNAY IS WONDERFUL

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:06.764
CABERNET'S.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.634
IT IS A FLAVOR PROFILE THAT ADDS.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.402
THAT CHARACTERISTIC TO THE WIND

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.703
THAT CONSUMERS LIKE.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:13.738
I'M.

00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:15.206
WHEN THE BILL WAS ART WHEN THE

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.008
RULES WERE ESTABLISHED THERE WAS

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:18.843
NO DISTILLING INDUSTRY IN

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.145
CALIFORNIA SPEAK UP -- I HAVE

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.213
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO WE STARTED

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.814
OUR DISTILLERY IMPASSE ROBLES

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.549
THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.617
DISTILLERS IN THE STATE AT THE

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.886
TIME -- SO THE RULES REALLY

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.389
HADN'T LOOKED AT SPIRITS BARRELS --

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.723
ACTUALLY IN SPIRITS IT IS EVEN

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.558
MORE IMPORTANT TO PUT THEM IN

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:34.926
OAK BARRELS BECAUSE WHEN I

00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:36.894
SPIRITS I COME OFF THE STILL

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.696
THERE ACTUALLY CLEAR AND DON'T

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.464
HAVE A LOT OF FLAVOR.

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:41.532
AND SO THE OAK BARREL WILL

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.833
ACTUALLY IN PART NOT ONLY THE

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.368
COLOR BUT A LOT OF THE FLAVORS

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:46.804
THAT MOST CONSUMERS I EXPECT

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.406
FROM THERE FOR THE FROM THEIR

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:49.173
AGE SPIRITS.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.741
I'M SURE WE LOOK AT AN OAK

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:51.943
BARREL AS AN INGREDIENT I'M NOT

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.778
AS A STORAGE CONTAINER AND ALL

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.780
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THE

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.281
BARRELS FOR SPIRITS PRODUCTION

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:58.916
OUR LOOK AT THE SAME AS THEY ARE

00:36:58.983 --> 00:36:59.483
FOR WINE.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.088
AND AT THE END OF THE CYCLE WILL

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.957
BE TAXED ON THE PRODUCT THAT

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:07.358
COMES OUT OF THOSE BARRELS WILL

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.159
BE SOLD TO THE CONSUMER AND

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:08.960
TAXED.

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.661
SO THE SALES TAX IS GETTING A

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.263
PICKED UP BUT IT JUST AT A LATER.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.065

SO ARM EVER SINCE THE END OF

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:23.452
REDEVELOPMENT YES OKAY THANK YOU

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:24.787
EVER SINCE THE END OF

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.255
REDEVELOPMENT THERE'S BEEN LESS.

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.057
LOCAL MONEY GOING TO AFFORDABLE

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:29.959
HOUSING I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:32.295
BRINGING REDEVELOPMENT BACK I

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.696
THINK THEY WERE TOO MANY.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.298
ABUSES HOW AND ALTHOUGH MY

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.565
COMMUNITY ALWAYS DID IT THE

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.334
RIGHT WAY BUT EVEN SO THEY DON'T

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.069
WANT IT TO COME BACK THEY SAID

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.470
THE THE COLLAPSE OF THE

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.472
PROGRAM'S SOMETHING THEY NEVER

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:44.640
WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH AGAIN.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.108
NONE THE LESS THIS WOULD BE A

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.910
WAY OF GETTING MONEY THAT THE

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.612
STATE WAS ALLOCATING FOR

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.580
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BACK TO

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.748
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:53.582
SO I'M CERTAINLY IN FAVOR OF

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:54.317
THAT.

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:58.454
THE ONE COMMENT WE HAVE.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:05:59.989
FOUR ODD THAT IN HERE IS THAT

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:03.392
BECAUSE IT TAX CREDIT IS WORTH

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.027
LESS THAN A DOLLAR -- WOULD IT

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:06.128
MAKE SENSE TO MAKE THIS A GRANT

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:08.531
PROGRAM I THINK THERE MAY BE A

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.899
PROBLEM THERE AND BRINGING THEM

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:11.634
ON THE FEDERAL MONEY IF YOU DO

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:13.602
THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW -- WOULD

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.237
YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SHOULD IT

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.472
BE A GRANT PROGRAM AND IF YOU

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:18.341
DID THAT WOULD IT BE A PROBLEM

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.742
GETTING THE FEDERAL MONEY SO THE

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.310
ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY YES THE

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:22.778
POINT WE STRUCTURE THIS IS TO

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.246
LEVERAGE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.948
DOLLARS WHICH ARE VERY WELL

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:26.849
ESTABLISHED.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.184
FEDERAL PROGRAM AND AND

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.553
ESSENTIALLY WE CAN LEVERAGE --

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.254
TWO OR THREE ACTS FOR EVERY

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.090
STATE DOLLARS THAT WE APPLY SO

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:34.724
THAT'S WHY WE STRUCTURE IT THIS

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.058
WAY AND NOW WE ALSO THERE ARE A

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:36.759
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.427
IN THIS BILL. TO INCREASE THE

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.996
VALUE OF THE TAX CREDIT SO

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:43.466
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO A DOLLAR

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:41.490
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FREEDOM.

NINETEEN NINETIES THE STATE WAS

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.235
A FISCAL BASKET CASE I REMEMBER

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.970
THAT FROM HAVING DOUBLE DIGIT

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.972

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:01.610
WE ALSO DECIDED. TO TAX NEWS WE

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.212
THOUGHT.

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.914
GETTING IN THE WAY OF AN

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.315
INFORMED CITIZENRY WAS A GOOD

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.118
IDEA. TO BALANCE CALIFORNIA'S

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:12.087
BUDGET AND SO THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.856
AND THE GOVERNOR PUT A TAX ON

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.357
PRINT NEWSPAPERS.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.992
OF COURSE ONLINE JOURNALISM IS

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.228
NOT TAXED BUT THERE IS THIS

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:20.329
DOUBLE STANDARD.

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:23.232

GET LOCAL NEWS.

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:32.408
AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:33.809
NOW THAT OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.010
ORDER THAT WE WORKED REALLY HARD

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:37.313
THE PAST SIX YEARS TO DO THAT.

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.348
THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THIS DOUBLE

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.182
STANDARD AWAY.

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.551

FAR AS NEWSPAPERS GO AND THE

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.549

POINTING THIS OUT -- TAX

AND ALSO -- AND NEWSPAPERS THAT --

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.837
OUR WEEKLY AS FAR AS SO LONG AS

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:10.839
SUBSCRIPTION.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:13.208
REALLY WHAT'S LEFT IN THE TAX IS

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.578
A TAX ON ABOUT SIXTY SIX DALY

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:17.212

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.087

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.121
NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE NEWS

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.624
PAPER BUSINESS WAS BOOMING --

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:31.226
NEWSPAPERS WERE VERY SECURE IN

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.361
THEIR POSITION IN THE ECONOMY.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.264
AND EVERYONE KNEW THAT THEY

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.232

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.067
TAX ON THEM.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.368
SINCE THAT TIME WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.136
TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:43.172
DESTRUCTION THAT'S OCCURRED --

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:46.308
BUT SINCE -- FOR EIGHTEEN

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.676
HUNDRED UNITED STATES NEWSPAPERS

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.211
ARE NO LONGER.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.114
BEING PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY --

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.949
WE'RE WORK ADVANCING THREE

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.652
ARGUMENTS FOR WHY THIS COMMITTEE

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.087
SHOULD PASS THIS BILL.

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:00.255
THE FIRST IS THAT NEWSPAPERS

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:01.757
CONTINUE TO CREATE A COMMUNITY

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:02.925
FORUM.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.394
THEY EXIST TO PROFESSIONALLY

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.061
GATHER.

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:06.929
AT IT.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.864
AND CREATE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.633
DAILY AND WEEKLY INFORMATION.

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.701
THAT HELPS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:13.936
BE BETTER IT HELPS OUR

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.771
COMMUNITIES TO BE BETTER AND

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:18.641
RESEARCH BEARS THIS OUT -- A

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.709
RECENT -- NEWMAN LAB ARTICLE

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.844
JUST READ YOU THE LEAD GRAPH IT

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:23.812
SAYS WHAT DO STRONG LOCAL

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.247
NEWSPAPERS DO.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:26.448
WELL RESEARCH SHOWS THEY

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:28.350
INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT REDUCE

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.918

FORCE LOCAL TV TO RAISE ITS GAME

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:41.897
AND ENCOURAGE SPLIT TICKET AND

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.833
MORE DIVERSE VOTING -- WE

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.069
BELIEVE THAT NEWSPAPERS ARE

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.739
STILL FIGHTING. TO TO THIS ROLE

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.042
AND ARE STILL DOING IT -- THE

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.910
SECOND THING AND THIS IS BEEN

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.446
COVERED -- THE TAXES PATENTLY

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.516
UNFAIR AS IT RELATES TO ABOUT

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.050
SIXTY SIX FIRST AMENDMENT

SPEAKERS.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.453
AS OPPOSED TO THE INTERNET AND

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.855
ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT ARE OUT

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.324
THERE -- WE'RE TAXING THE PEOPLE

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.492
WHO WERE STILL IN THEIR

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:11.994
COMMUNITIES CREATING.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.762
INFORMATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.631
THE PUBLIC AND WE'RE EXEMPTING

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:17.700
THAT AGGREGATORS AND SCRAPERS

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.268
AND PROCESS ESPECIALLY THE

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.436
DUOPOLY.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.404
THERE BECAUSE SO MUCH HAVOC --

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.440
FINALLY.

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:25.774
NEWSPAPERS ARE AND THEY'RE STILL

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.643
FIGHTING -- WHAT'S LEFT OF THE

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.678
NEWSPAPER BUSINESS IS STILL

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:32.014
ANXIOUS.

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.182
TO GET HIS FEET UNDER IT TO FIND

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.683
A NEW BUSINESS MODEL.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.852
AND TO CONTINUE TO SERVE

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:39.121
CALIFORNIANS. FOR ALL THOSE

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.789
REASONS WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:41.657
WHEN THIS COMES BEFORE I WANT TO

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.659
MAKE ONE ONE MORE POINT THAT UP

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.661
FOR CLARIFICATION THIS IS A TAX

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.930
ON THE CONSUMER WHO BUYS THE

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.565
NEWSPAPER TO READ AND BECOME

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.300
INFORMED IT'S NOT A TAX ON THE

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:52.367
BUSINESS.

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:54.603
IT'S A TAX ON A PERSON WHO WANTS

01:12:54.670 --> 01:13:00.109
TO PURCHASE THAT NEWSPAPER.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:04.046
ADDITIONAL TESTS MY IN SUPPORT.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.348
TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.216
SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:08.317
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:13.288
DARK QUIRK -- SO.

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:13.956
I'M NOT.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.657
SO IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT NOW IF I

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.727
PAY SIXTY SIX DOLLARS A YEAR. TO

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.096
GET TO A NEWSPAPER I'D HAVE TO

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:22.865
PAY SIXTY INSTEAD.

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:26.235
IF THE TAX WENT DOWN -- THERE IS

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:29.571
A TAX APPLIED ON TO THE COST OF

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.707
THE NEWSPAPER -- I I I DON'T

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:32.708
KNOW BUT BASICALLY IT WOULD

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:35.811
REDUCE MY COST BY ABOUT 10% I'M

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:36.912
NOT.

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.580
I WOULD HAVE TO CLARIFY EXACTLY

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:39.782
WHAT THE COST OF THE TAXES WELL

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.350
RIGHT I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.718
YES WITH THE TAX WITH THE

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:44.353
SAVINGS OF THE SALES TAX BECAUSE

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:44.953
YOU'RE SAYINGTHIS IS A SALES

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.455
TAX THAT CONSUMERS ARE PAYING

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.157
WITH THAT WOULD THAT SAVINGS GO

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:51.693
DIRECTLY. TO THE CONSUMER OR

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.295
SAYING THAT THE CHALLENGE ON

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:54.396
NEWSPAPERS.

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.831
THEY'RE GOING TO USE THEM TAX

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:56.732
MONEY THEY'RE GONNA KEEP

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.267
CHARGING THE SAME PRICE AND

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:01.069
SPEND THAT TAX MONEY ON OTHER

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:01.904
THINGS I THINK THAT OUT OF THE

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:02.938
CLOSET AND THE TAXES A SURCHARGE

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.006
ON THE CONSUMER.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.440
SO PRECISELY YOUR POINT YOU

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:06.775
WOULD BE SAVING THE MONEY THAT

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.710
WOULD NOT SO I'D SAY SIX DOLLARS

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.814
YEAR -- MY CONCERN IS THAT WE

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.583
ALREADY HAVE NO LOCAL NEWSPAPERS

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.285
AND ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:19.121
SORRY TO HEAR THAT AND I I

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:21.490
HONESTLY THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.392
GIVEN THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE IS

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.027
THEY JUST KEEP FEET SIXTY SIX

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.930
DOLLARS AND KEEP THE SIX DOLLARS --

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.464
WE USED TO HAVE SIX REPORTERS IN

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.033
HAYWARD NOW WE GET A HALF OF

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:34.570
REPORTER EVERY OTHER MONTH -- I

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.871
I JUST DON'T THINK IT THIS WOULD

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:40.776
BRING IT BACK BUT I'M STILL

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.911
WILLING TO CONSIDER THE BELL.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:43.679
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.514
IN THE COMMITTEE.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.716
I A I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:49.184
QUALITY NEWSPAPERS -- BUT I

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.053
THINK MY QUESTION IS THE SAME IS

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.487
THAT IS THIS SOMETHING WE'RE

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:54.423
GOING TO PASS ON I I I'M GETTING

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:55.958
KIND OF CONFLICTING MESSAGES ONE

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.392
IS SAYING THAT THE SALES TAX IS

01:14:57.459 --> 01:15:00.329
PART OF THE DEMISE OF THE

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:00.929
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PAPERS THAT

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.331
HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:03.332
BUT I'M ALSO GETTING THE MESSAGE

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.635
THAT THAT SALES TAX IS NO LONGER

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.136
PAID BY THE CONSUMER.

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.171
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE PASSED TO

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.272
THE CONSUMER AND SO I THINK

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.640
THERE'S A LITTLE CONFUSION THERE

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.908
AND AT SOME POINT IT WOULD BE

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.109
GREAT SINCE IS THIS TESTIMONY

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.044
ONLY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.080
THAT CONVERSATION AND CLARIFY --

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.748
EXACTLY WHAT THE INTENT IS A

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.316
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE RESPECT FOR

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:23.585
QUALITY NEWSPAPERS AND I DO WANT

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.987
TO SEE THEM THRIVE BUT I ALSO

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:25.754
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.522
UNDERSTAND AS A COMMITTEE WHAT

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:28.924
THE GOALS ARE.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.359
IS THE GOAL TO PASS THAT BACK ON

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.660
TO ROUTE TO CONSUMERS OR IS THE

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:32.861
GOAL TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.464
INVESTED IN SOME OTHER WAY WITH

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.634
NEWSPAPERS [inaudible]

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.069
ARE YOU.

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.905
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO SINCE

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.373
THIS IS TESTIMONY ONLY AND NOW

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.475
WOULD BE THE TIME TO WORK OUT

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.243
SOME OF THESE.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.280
I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING IT.

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.582
SHOW -- IT'S A MARKET BASED

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.417
DECISION RIGHT AND AND EVERY

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.352
CONSUMER OF NEWS HAS TO

01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:59.021
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.756
GOING TO PAY THE AMOUNT.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:04.092
OF THE PRINT SUBSCRIPTION.

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.861
OR PURCHASE THE OVER COUNTER

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.829
OVER THE COUNTER COPY -- THE

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:10.165
TAXES ADDED TO THAT.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.768
IF THE TAX IS REPEALED.

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:15.337
EACH NEWSPAPER.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.772
IS GOING TO HAVE TO DETERMINE --

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.840
HOW IT PRICES IT'S NEWSPAPERS

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.009
GOING FORWARD I SUSPECT THAT

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:24.579
MOST NEWSPAPERS WILL -- GIVE

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:26.114
THAT MONEY BACK TO THE CONSUMER

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.716
BY LOWERING THEIR BETTER PRICE

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.718
BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT -- WITH

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.987
EXACTITUDE AND IN FACT -- I

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.656
SUSPECT THAT SOME NEWSPAPERS

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.791
WOULD LOVE TO RE EMPLOY.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:39.561
SOME OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:40.862
REPORTERS THAT ARE NO LONGER

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.764
DOING THAT JOB.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.232
AN END TO THAT THE LITTLE BIT OF

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.335
THAT POINT THE AMOUNT OF TAX

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.603
REVENUE HAS.

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.539
BEEN DECIMATED -- IN THE COURSE

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.107
OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS -- IT'S

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.108
A FRACTION OF WHAT WAS ONCE

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:58.013
COLLECTED.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.648
ANY OTHER REASON.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:00.782
SO ESSENTIALLY IT WILL BE UP TO

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.217
THE INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER WHETHER

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:05.153
OR NOT THEY LEAVE THE PRICE

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.389
WHERE IT IS OUR RETURN THAT THAT.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.324
PORTION TO THE CONSUMER -- OKAY

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.425
SO.

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:11.626
I APOLOGIZE I HAD ANOTHER

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.328
COMMITTEE THAT I HAD TO BE

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.464
PRESIDENT'S I MISSED MOST OF THE

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:18.066
CONVERSATION BUT WHAT YOU'RE

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:21.203
SAYING IS THAT THE THE TAX WOULD

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.204
BE.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.772
TAKEN AWAY WHICH WOULD BE A

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:26.408
SAVINGS TO THE CUSTOMER RIGHT.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.577
AND THE CONCERN IS THOUGH THAT

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.545
NEWSPAPERS WELL KEEP THE PRICE

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.014
THE SAME IF THE PAPERS FOR

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.950
DOLLARS -- IN THE TALES TAXES

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.952
TAKEN AWAY IT WILL THE NEWSPAPER

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.186
TO GET TO KEEP IT FOR DOLLARS

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:40.022
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S USED TO

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:40.655
PAYING FOUR DOLLARS [inaudible]

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:43.492
RIGHT.

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.126
THAT THAT'S THE FEAR THAT I AND

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.360
THAT.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:46.628
OKAY YEAH AND SO THAT'S

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.430
CERTAINLY.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.798
ONE ONE POTENTIAL OUTCOME -- I

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:52.567
THINK EACH OF THE NEWSPAPERS

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.436
WILL DEAL WITH THAT THEIR OWN

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.505
WAY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.306
MANY WOULD LOVE TO INVEST.

01:17:58.373 --> 01:17:59.408
SOME OF THAT REVENUE BACK INTO

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:00.809
THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:02.644
BY EMPLOYING.

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.046
NEWS GATHERERS TO SERVE THEIR

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:11.686
COMMUNITY -- SO WHAT I'M HEARING

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.889
IS AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.057
OF SUBSCRIPTIONS THE PAIR FOLKS

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:16.425
HAVE BEEN LAID OFF THE HOPE IS

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.926
THAT SOME WILL USE SOME OF THE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.861
SALES TAX TO PUT WERE WHAT THAT

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.296
SPACE LOOKS LIKE IN TO RE

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.497
EMPLOYING SOME OF THE OLD

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:23.231
REPORTERS WHILE OTHERS.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:26.568
WILL RETURN THAT COST TO AT THE

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.303
CUSTOMERS BUT THAT'S ON IN THE

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.039
BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN TODAY --

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:31.973

IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET.

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.385

OTHER STATE TAX CREDIT.

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.317

PASSED THROUGH OUR STRUCTURE TO

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.988
PASS THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:14.669

AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE USING

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.821
A METHODOLOGY OF TAX PAYMENT.

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:37.325
THAT WAS AN INCOME TAX BECAUSE

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.360
SOME TAXPAYER OUT THERE COULD

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:43.331
USE A DIFFERENT -- CHOICE OF OF

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:46.267
PAYING THEIR TAXES -- TO TEXAS.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.770
THEY DISQUALIFIED THE CALIFORNIA

TAXPAYERS WHOSE PAINT ON AN

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:52.206

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:56.511
WITH F. T. V. THAN GOING BACK

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.478
AND FORTH ON SOME OF THE

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:58.613
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT AND

01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.514
AND THAT.

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:01.516
AND BUT THEY DID BRING UP A

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:04.419
COUPLE POINTS IN A JUST. ONE TO

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:05.320
ADDRESS THEM SO THAT THEY ARE

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.721

THAT UP IS CONCERNED.

01:27:17.298 --> 01:27:19.133
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE THEY

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:19.767
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THE

01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:22.737
NUMBERS TO KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS.

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.105
FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.607
SIXTEEN ACTUALLY QUALIFIED FOR

THE S. T. C..

THAT -- DELINEATED BUT AT THIS

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:38.186

WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:46.294
THAT'S BEEN.

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:47.729
WE ARGUE THAT IT'S THAT IT

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.731
WOULDN'T COST ANYTHING BECAUSE

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:51.799
THE FACT THAT FROM TEN IT WAS

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:54.168

SO THAT'S THE SCOPE -- ONE OTHER

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:07.548
ISSUE -- IS THE TALKED ABOUT

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.616
THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE THE LAW

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:11.619
THE THE THE THE THE LAW.

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:13.254
THE LAW THE INTERPRETATIONS AND

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:15.023
THE FACT IS THIS WOULD RELY ON

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:17.625
ALL THE THE THE COURT CASES AND

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.527
ALL THE DEFINITIONS THERE'S NO

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.562
CHANGING DEFINITIONS -- OF

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:23.731
ANYTHING AT THIS POINT IT JUST

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.066
ALLOWS.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:25.733
FOR WHEN YOU DO WITH THE INCOME

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.369
TAX TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT IF

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:31.305
YOU PAY THAT WAY TO THE ACTUAL

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:31.973
WAY YOU YOU APPLY YOUR TAX SO.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.141
THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:34.709
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I THOUGHT I

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:36.177
WOULD DRESS AND I'LL TURN OVER

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:37.178
THE MISTER LOW.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.247
FOR A DENTIST Là PRODUCTO LACED

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.682
S. CORPORATION.

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:42.350
BASICALLY WHAT MISTER ROBINSON

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:43.785
IS IS THE MOST RELEVANT THERE'S

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.187
BEEN NOTHING SINCE THE ORIGINAL.

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:49.724
HAVE TO BE -- A GUIDANCE AND AND

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:50.358
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE'S BEEN

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:52.160
NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER IN THE LAW

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:53.661
THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN COURT

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:56.130
DECISION SINCE AT THAT TIME.

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:59.033
SO SOMEBODY HAD AN EPIPHANY IN

01:28:59.100 --> 01:28:59.534
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.202
REVERSED -- WITH THE TAXPAYERS

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:03.104
OF KNOWING FOR ALL THOSE YEARS

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:07.508
OF MAKES NO SENSE -- SO BECAUSE

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:08.643
OF THE FLIP UP WE THINK IT NEEDS

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.011
GUIDANCE OF THE OF OF THE

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.113
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE RATHER

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:12.780
THAN.

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.015
LETTING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:14.882
WHAT LEGAL WOULD DO AND AGAIN

01:29:14.949 --> 01:29:22.623
AND TEN MORE YEARS SO FOR THOSE

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.991
REASONS MASTERS.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:24.625
FOR WHAT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:25.426
SUPPORT.

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:27.795
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION XENON

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:28.863
COMES IN QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:32.600
COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO.

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:33.134
THIS IS OF COURSE FAIRLY

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.001
CONFUSING BUT ONE OF THE

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.203
COMMENTS -- BY STAFF.

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:36.938
IS THAT THE TEXAS TAX IS MUCH

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:37.338
LIKE.

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.707
TAXES IN OTHER STATES WHICH ARE

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:42.610
NOT TREATED AS INCOME TAXES THAT

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:44.746
IN FACT IT'S A TAX ON GROSS

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:47.849
RECEIPTS RATHER THAN ON INCOME --

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.584
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.086
THE TEXAS TAX HAS THREE METHODS

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:53.721
ONE OF THOSE METHODS WHICH WE'RE

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:55.256
TRYING TO ADDRESS IN WHICH THE

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.924
TAXPAYERS USUALLY ADDRESS IS THE

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:58.993
COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR WHICH

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.495
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.731
AGREES IS A INCOME TAX OR GROSS

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.533
INCOME.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.901
YEAH THERE IS NOT A CONTROVERSY

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.302
FOR WITH FTV THAT THAT THAT IF

01:30:08.369 --> 01:30:10.838
YOU USE COST OF GOODS SOLD THAT

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.373
THAT ISN'T AN INCOME TAX.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.041
WHY IS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.110
INCOME TAX YOU CAN SELL THINGS

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.346
AND HAVE NO INCOME?

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.814
BECAUSE YOUR COSTS ARE GREATER

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.114
[inaudible]

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.282
I THINK.

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:25.419
YOUR METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:26.020
PROFIT BASE AND COST OF GOODS

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:29.390
SOLD. OH OH OKAY FINE.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.558
ALL RIGHT SO THERE IS A WAY THAT

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.527
THIS CAN BE AN INCOME TAX IN

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:33.694
TEXAS [inaudible]

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:36.230
YES.

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:37.265
BUT YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:39.300
IT'S IN INCOME TAX OR ANOTHER

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.902
KIND OF TAX.

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:44.071
YES THE THE THE ACTUALLY TEXAS

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:44.839
LAW.

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.441
IS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SPECIFIC

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:51.846
INCOME TAX BUT RECOGNIZES AS THE

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.881
COST OF GOODS SOLD OF METHOD OF

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.150
CALCULATING THE TAX AS AN AS IS

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.752
BASICALLY TAXES SO BASICALLY

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.387
IT'S TAXING THE DIFFERENCE

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.421
BETWEEN.

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.657
WHAT IT COST YOU TO PRODUCE THE

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:06.160
GOOD AND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AND?

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.361
IN.

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:07.995
AND WHEN YOU SALAS IS THAT WHAT

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:09.230
IT DOES.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.932
SO THAT'S ONE WAY THEY CAN TAX

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.533
AND THEN THEY HAVE OTHER WAYS

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.634
THEY CAN TAX.

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:16.003
IN A COMPANY CAN CHOOSE WHICH

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:18.172
WAY IT WANTS TO DO IT PROBABLY

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.308
BASED UPON -- WHAT'S MOST

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:21.542
FAVORABLE TO THEM.

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.744
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.479
AFTER THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.781
DOING IT.

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:30.751
YOUR CONSULT CAN ANSWER THAT

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.720
BETTER THAN I CAN ALL RIGHT.

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:35.690
THIS IS CONFUSING.

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:36.891
THE GOAL IS JUST TO ENSURE THAT.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:42.196
YOU WHETHER YOU ARE SELLING

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.130
TEXAS OR SELLING PRODUCTS IN

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.465
PENNSYLVANIA AND MAKING.

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.767
A PROFIT THERE THAT THE WAY THAT

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.536
THE TAXATION IS TREATED.

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:50.972
IS UNIFORMS AND FAIR AND THAT WE

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:52.773
DO NOT HAVE A POLICY OF DOUBLE

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.375
TAXATION.

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:55.910
FOR IF ANY OF RIGHT AND AND I

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:58.179
AGREE WITH THAT THE PROBLEM IS

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.380
THE F. T. V..

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.382
HAS PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY DO

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:02.917
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL AND LIKE

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:05.152
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM EXCEPT

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.654
PERHAPS FOR COMMITTEE STAFF.

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:09.457
AND THEY VIEWED IT AS NOT AND SO

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.125
I I'M JUST I NEED A LOT MORE

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:13.194
INFORMATION BEFORE I COULD VOTE

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:14.228
ON THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.763
WORK WITH OUR TV I THINK TO TO

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.798
CLARIFY SOME OF THE DISCREPANCY

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.400
I THINK BETWEEN.

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.536
THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND AND OUR

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:25.172
UNDERSTANDING I THINK RIGHT

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:25.940
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS.

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:27.341
IN MY MIND IS THAT THERE WAS AN

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:28.976
INTERPRETATION CHANGE THAT WAS

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.613
MADE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.148
AS WE HIGHLIGHTED.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.450
THAT WAS NOT PROMPTED BY ANY

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:38.119
LEGISLATIVE ACTION READY TO

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:40.321
SERVE EXECUTIVE ACTION IT IT WAS

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.355
JUST A RE INTERPRETATION YEAH

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:42.723
BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT'S MORE

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.659
IN LINE WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:45.993
FOR OTHER STATES.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.728
AND ARE WE GONNA HAVE AN A A

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:54.635
BILL ON INDIANA TAX NEXT -- SO I

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.236
JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LOT

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.671
MORE.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:57.838
GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:58.439
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.173
COMMITTEE.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.675
I THINK I THINK THAT WE I THINK

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.042
THAT.

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:02.476
I ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE A LITTLE

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:03.811
BIT MORE I KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.646
WITH THE UNIVERSE LOOKS LIKE.

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:06.547
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:07.581
THE NEW INTERPRETATION OR THE

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:09.083
INTERPRETATION AS IT STANDS NOW

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:10.618
I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A CHANGE AND

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:11.986
THAT IT WAS GO IT'S GOING BACK I

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.087
UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT.

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.488
BUT I THINK WE STILL WANT TO

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:15.523
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:17.892
IS THIS A BILL FOR SIX PEOPLE OR

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.894

ARE BEING SUBSTANTIVELY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:34.408
PENALIZED BY THIS

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:35.977
REINTERPRETATION.

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:41.549

WITH MY YEARLY ATTEMPT TO MAKE

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:32.786
DIAPERS TAX FREE -- AS WE KNOW

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.555
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A POLICY

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:35.890
OF TAXING THINGS THAT ARE HEALTH

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.759
NECESSITIES OF WHICH DIAPERS ARE.

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.995
BEYOND THAT -- WE KNOW THAT ONE

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.296
IN THREE FAMILIES NATIONWIDE

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:44.265
STRUGGLE THEY ADMIT TO

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.833
STRUGGLING AND NOT USING OF A

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:46.934
CORRECT AMOUNT OF DIAPERS ON

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.736
THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:50.004
EXPENSE OF DIAPERS.

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.139
THE COST TO DIAPER A CHILD

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:55.309
RANGES FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:56.143
DOLLARS A MONTH PROBABLY.

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.645
MR MULLIN PAYS MORE THAN THAT

01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:00.548
WITH TWO CHILDREN -- AND THE TAX

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:01.949
ON THOSE DIAPERS THEN. FOR THE

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:04.218
YEAR IS ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A FULL

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:06.153
MONTH SUPPLY OF DIAPERS SO THIS

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.023
IS AN INCONSEQUENTIAL IT'S NOT --

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:09.990
TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT FEELS

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:11.025
GOOD IT'S TO DO SOMETHING

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.794
BECAUSE WE DESPERATELY NEED IT.

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:16.363
I IN CALIFORNIA ALONE OVER 60%

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.698
OF CHILDREN ARE BORN INTO

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:18.899
POVERTY.

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.601
ABOUT THAT NUMBER ARE BORN ON

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.303
MEDI CAL AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.637
CHILDREN WHO ARE BROWN AND BLACK

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:25.439
THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO ABOUT TWO

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:26.340
THIRDS.

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:27.575
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:28.809
THAT MOST BABIES WE KNOW IN THE

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:30.811
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE BORN

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.546
INTO FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING --

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.515
TO PAY THE BILLS AND THOSE WHO

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:36.517
AREN'T -- THOSE WHO ARE KIND OF

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.552
IN THE MIDDLE CLASS WE CAN TALK

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:39.520
ABOUT THEM AS WELL BECAUSE THE

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:40.254
PROGRAMS THAT WE USUALLY

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:42.256
DESIGNATOR TO HELP WORKING CLASS

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:43.958
FAMILIES AND POOR FAMILIES.

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:47.428
BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES

01:37:47.494 --> 01:37:48.629
WHO -- ARE OFTEN THE MOST

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.730
VULNERABLE TIME ECONOMICALLY AND

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:50.331
ARE HAVING YOUNG CHILDREN ARE

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:51.465
ALSO AFFECTED BY THE COST OF

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:55.936
DIAPERS AND SO OBVIOUSLY -- TO

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.471
RELIEVE TAXES IN A WAY THAT

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.105
WOULD FOR A FILL A FULL MONTH'S

01:37:58.172 --> 01:37:58.939
SUPPLY OF DIAPERS A SOMETHING

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.441
THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO A VAST

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:02.076
MAJORITY AN OVERWHELMING

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:04.078
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:06.847
I THINK THIS IS -- AN IMPORTANT

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.682
FEATURE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A

01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:09.283
AYE DESIGNATION OF SOMETHING

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:11.385
THAT -- WE KNOW SHOULD BE DONE

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:13.387
IT ACTUALLY HELPS INDIVIDUALS

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:14.822
AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.690
TIME AGAIN -- THAT I SHOULD GO

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:18.559
LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO HELP

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:21.795
PEOPLE A DIAPER NEED AND WE'VE

01:38:21.862 --> 01:38:23.063
DONE JUST THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.398
PASS THE FIRST IN THE NATION.

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:25.933
EFFORTS TO HELP US --

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.002
INDIVIDUALS ON CAL WORKS OBTAIN

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.503
DIAPER SO THAT THEY CAN PUT

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.538
THEIR CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE AND

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.540
GET A JOB OR GO TO SCHOOL THIS

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:34.842
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE OF US

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.310
WHO HAVE KIDS AND UNDERSTAND.

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:37.778
THE YOU CANNOT SEND YOUR CHILD

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.113
TO CHILD CARE WITHOUT EIGHT OR

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:40.714
TEN DIAPERS FOR THE DAY -- WE

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.616
HAD TREMENDOUS STORIES OF WOMEN

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:43.917
WHO HAD FINALLY GOTTEN

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.419
SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE HAD FOUND

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:47.121
THEMSELVES A JOB SHOWED UP THE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.389
FIRST DAY IN COULD NOT DROP

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:50.124
THEIR CHILD OFF BECAUSE THEY

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.558
DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA EIGHT TO TEN

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:52.126
DIAPERS.

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:54.461
WE ALLEVIATED THAT PROBLEM

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:56.897
THROUGH -- THROUGH A CAL WORKS

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.299
AND THERE IS NOW AN ABILITY TO

01:38:58.365 --> 01:38:59.733
GET UP TO THIRTY DIAPERS THIRTY

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.001
DOLLARS WORTH OF DIAPERS FOR THE

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:03.103
MONTH THAT'S A POSITIVE IS A

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.638
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.006
LAST YEAR WE ALLOCATED TEN

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:07.975
MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE FOR

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.576
THREE YEARS TO DO PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:39:09.643 --> 01:39:11.645
PARTNERSHIPS WITH FOUR AREAS THE

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:13.347
STATE THAT CURRENTLY HAVE DIAPER

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:15.249

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:16.817
CO JOINED WITH FOOD BANKS.

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.585
AND ALTHOUGH THAT ALSO HELPS IT

01:39:18.652 --> 01:39:19.920
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE LOS

01:39:19.987 --> 01:39:21.588

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.325
ALLOCATIONS ARE BEING MADE.

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.092
THEY'RE STILL FAR TOO MANY

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:27.394
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.263
HAVE THAT EXTRA THE RELIEF THE

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.899
ONLY WAY TO PROVIDE THAT RELIEF

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.434
WHOLESALE ACROSS THE STATE IS TO

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.102
START WITH DIAPER TAX.

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:36.870
THE FACT THE DIAPERS ARE JUST

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.439
TOO EXPENSIVE AND I BERNIE

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:39.807
CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM CAN BE

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.175

WHO WHO WHO WAS THRILLED TO

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:18.939
LEARN THAT THIS BILL WAS BEING

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:20.140
HEARD BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:22.209
HAS A STEADY JOB THE COST OF

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:25.078
DIAPERS IS MAKING HER LIFE THAT

01:41:25.145 --> 01:41:26.113
MUCH HARDER?

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:26.680
THIS IS BECAUSE DIAPERS ARE

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.081
EXPENSIVE IN THE MOST SHOCKING

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:29.650
PART IS THE CHILD CARE CENTERS

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:32.119
REQUIRING A FULL DAY'S SUPPLY OF

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.687

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:39.927
A LIMITED TAX FROM DIAPERS CAN

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:41.161
HELP BREAK A VICIOUS CYCLE OF

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:43.497

HAVING CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:21.822
ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- CALIFORNIA

LEGISLATION WE REALLY BELIEVE

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:44.611
THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO

QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:27.888
DR -- THIS IS AN HONEST QUESTION

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:29.322
SO I WAS THE OLDEST TO SEVEN

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.557
RAISED IN THE FIFTIES AND

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:33.894
FORTIES -- AND WE HAD CLOTH

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.197
DIAPERS ARE THOSE NOT -- REALLY

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.965
AVAILABLE ANYMORE.

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:40.967
SO AT DARK CLOTH DIAPERS AND

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:42.436
MOST PEOPLE USE THE MUSEUM

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:43.470
THROUGH SERVICES ARE A COUPLE

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:45.005
PROBLEMS WITH CLOTH DIAPERS FOR

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:46.406
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND EVEN

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:48.175
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UPPER AND

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:49.710
MIDDLE CLASS ONE IS THE CHILD

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:51.445
CARE FACILITIES DON'T ACCEPT

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:52.112
CLOTH DIAPERS.

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:55.782
I'M OBVIOUSLY ONCE SOIL THERE US.

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:57.451
RIGHT TO TELL YOU AS A TAX RATE

01:45:57.517 --> 01:46:00.020
THEY ARE TOXIC WASTE AND SO --

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:01.254
CHILD CARE FACILITIES DON'T

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.957
ACCEPT THEM AS A USABLE FORM THE

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.025
OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE DON'T

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.393
THINK ABOUT A LOT -- I HAVE

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.128
COMMUNITY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:09.563
LAUNDROMATS IN LAUNDROMATS

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:11.264
ACTUALLY YOU CANNOT USE CLOTH

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:12.733
DIAPERS YOU CAN'T WATCH THEM IN

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.034
LAUNDROMATS AND NOW THAT WE'VE

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:16.203
GONE TO LOW FLOW TOILETS WHAT

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:18.205
USED TO HAPPEN I MEAN I'M SORRY

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:20.907
GET SO IN DEPTH BUT LIKE I DON'T

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:21.274
KNOW WHAT THIS.

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:26.913
IS I TORN SO WHAT USED TO HAPPEN

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:27.514
LIKE WHEN MY MY MOTHER USED TO

01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:28.315
AYE.

01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.850
DIAPERS AND SHE SAID SHE'D FIRST

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:31.885
WATCHED AMOUNT THE TOILET AND GO

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.720
OUTSIDE AND WE AND I WATCHED HIM

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:34.921
I GOT A LOT ABOUT MUCH THEM --

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:35.856
SO BECAUSE WE'VE WE SWITCH TO

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:36.490
LOW FOR TOILETS THAT'S NOT EVEN

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:39.025
A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO CLEAN

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:39.659
DIAPERS ALLEN HAS A PRE WASH.

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:40.861
AND SO IT IT REALLY LEAVES -- OF

01:46:40.927 --> 01:46:41.728
MOST COMMUNITIES WHO CAN'T

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:42.596
AFFORD AN ACTUAL DIAPER SERVICE

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:44.331
FROM BEING ABLE TO USE OUR RELY

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:45.732
ON CLOTH DIAPERS ALL OKAY.

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:46.733
GREAT AND THEN THE OTHER

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.868
QUESTION I HAVE IS -- IT'S IN

01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:49.503
THE ANALYSIS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.671
POOR WOMAN WHO HAD A CHILD WHO

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:53.440
KEPT THE SAME DIAPER FOR DAYS AT

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:55.008
A TIME.

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:56.510
NEEDS A LOT MORE THAN A 10%

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:57.544
DISCOUNT.

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:59.913
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T NEED

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.014
THAT DISCOUNT IT ALL.

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:04.151
UP YOU'VE MENTIONED THE CREDIT

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:05.819
ON NOW CAO WORKS.

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:07.187
WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:09.222
SPEND THIS MONEY TARGETED SAY

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:11.658
THROUGH EITHER MEDI CAL OR CAO

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:15.028
FRESH OR SOME OTHER -- PROGRAM --

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:15.929
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:17.631
THAT SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE AN

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:18.598
ANSWER FOR ME I DO KNOW FIRST OF

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:21.568
ALL CAL FRESH WE CAN'T USE -- WE

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:22.969
CAN'T USE FOOD STAMPS

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:24.738
UNFORTUNATELY TO BUY DIAPERS ARE

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:25.405
WAY UP WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL OF

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:26.139
THESE.

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:29.109
THESE POSSIBILITIES EVEN THROUGH --

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:31.745
CAL WORKS IT'S A DIFFICULT

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.180
SITUATION BECAUSE NUMBER ONE THE

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:34.147
MOUNT OF TIME THAT SOMEBODY'S ON

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.382
CAL WORKS.

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:36.817
DESPITE HOW LONG THAT THEY NEED

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:38.018
TO BE IN THAT CHILD NEEDS TO BE

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.921
IN DIAPERS ALSO THE NUMBER OF

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:42.122
PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS SO.

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.923
CHILDREN -- BEING BORN INTO

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:44.457
POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA A LARGE

01:47:44.524 --> 01:47:46.259
NUMBER OF THEM ARE NOT -- ON CAL

01:47:46.326 --> 01:47:48.195
WORKS THERE IS AT A DISPARITY

01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:51.231
BETWEEN THAT IN SOMETHING LIKE

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:52.132
DIAPER NEED THAT IS SO COSTLY SO

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.900
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:54.601
TO TWO HOW A HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:57.237
MINIMUM A YEAR PER FAMILY.

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:58.205
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS IN

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:00.774
CAN BENEFIT FAR MORE THAN JUST --

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.275
POOR WORKING CLASS AND LOWER

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:04.311
MIDDLE CLASS I MEAN THAT'S

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:04.911
GETTING INTO THE RANGE THAT

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:06.279
REALLY DOES ALLEVIATE STRESS OFF

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:07.681
OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.

01:48:07.747 --> 01:48:09.583
AND SO WHATWE FIND IS THAT WE

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.351
CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND I I

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:13.520
WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH -- DIAPER

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:15.555
BANKS AND AND CAL WORKS

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:16.990
PROPOSALS AND OTHER WAYS TO GET

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:18.425
DIAPERS IN THE HANDS OF POOR

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:19.459
POOR MOMS.

01:48:19.526 --> 01:48:20.794
IMPORT MANLEY'S -- BUT IN

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:26.433
PARTICULAR MOMS BUT IN REALITY

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:27.968
WE'RE NOT THE TO REACH THE NEED

01:48:28.034 --> 01:48:28.969
THAT WE NEED -- TO ULTIMATELY WE

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.303
WE WE SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:31.371
THE COSTA DIAPERS -- I'M NOT

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:31.972
QUITE THERE YET I PROMISE YOU

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:33.874
ALL GET THERE -- BUT THIS IS ONE

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.508
ONE EASY THING WE CAN DO I WAS

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:36.943
TRYING MY HARDEST TO FIND THE

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.279
NUMBER OF KIDS WHO ARE BORN TO

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:40.614
WEALTHY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA I

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.115
CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THAT NUMBER.

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.884
BUT WHAT WE DO NOW IS THE NUMBER

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.485
OF CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN ON MEDI

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:47.687
CAL IS WAY OVER 50% THAT THE

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:48.488
NUMBER OF CHILDREN BORN INTO

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:49.689
POVERTY ESPECIALLY BLACK AND

01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:50.857
BROWN CHILDREN.

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:52.492
IT IS CLOSER TO TWO THIRDS IN SO

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.294
IF YOU ADD THAT ON TOP OF MIDDLE

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.329
CLASS YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA GET --

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:57.797
REALLY.

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:59.366
AFFECTING FAMILIES WHO ARE THEIR

01:48:59.432 --> 01:49:00.800
MOST CRITICAL TIME HER USING THE

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.035
MOST VULNERABLE TIME OF THEIR

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.236
COSTS ARE THE HIGHEST IN THESE

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:04.471
NEEDS ARE THE GREATEST AND BY

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:05.805
THE WAY THIS IS.

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.507
A NEED THAT CAMP -- BE FOR

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:09.676
FILLED IN ANY OTHER WAY SO I AYE

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:11.244
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO EXEMPT

01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:13.146
RICH PEOPLE I MEAN SURE I'D DO

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.215
IT -- BUT I I CAN'T SEE A

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.183
FUNCTIONAL WAY TO GET THIS TYPE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.718
OF RELIEF AND THE AMOUNT OF

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:20.253
FAMILIES HANDS THAT WE NEEDED TO

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.322
GET INTO WITHOUT DEALING WITH IT

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:24.024
AGAIN AT ANOTHER WAY EXCEPT

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:24.824
THROUGH.

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:26.426
THE THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:29.496
SALES TAX OKAY -- IS THERE ANY

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:31.331
WAY TO DO THROUGH MEDI CAL.

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:32.265
MEDI CAL SO.

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:33.867
YOU WERE ELIGIBLE MIGHT ALSO GET

01:49:33.934 --> 01:49:35.135

SPECIFIC REASON OKAY -- BUT IT

IT THERE WAS A REASON BY WHICH

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.821
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE USE MEDI CAL

01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:55.956

SPECIFIC REASON HE THOUGHT THAT

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:15.442

NOT TAKEN ON THE ADULT DIAPER

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:52.612
ISSUE IS ACTUALLY THROUGH.

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.481
MEDICARE ADULT DIAPERS YOU CAN

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:55.949
GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR ADULT

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:56.783
DIAPERS AND THEN THEY ARE TAX

01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:57.517
FREE.

01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:59.352
AND SO THERE IS A MECHANISM

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:01.988
CURRENTLY BY WHICH ADULTS WHO

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:04.224

THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT --

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.095
IT SHOWS THE DISPARITY IN THE

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:10.530
WAY WE ADDRESS THAT THERE IS NO

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:11.765
WAY TO DO IT OF COURSE THROUGH

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.266
THE YOUNGER CHILD BUT AS AS YOU

01:51:13.333 --> 01:51:14.334
AGE.

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:16.202
THERE IS A PRESCRIPTION.

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:16.970
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THOUGH THAT

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.238
THOSE DIAPERS AREN'T AS NICE AS

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:19.105
THE ONES YOU BUY OVER THE

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:24.878
COUNTER AND SO WE MAY STILL WANT

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:26.413
TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE.

01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:27.213
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.381
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:31.384
SEEING NONE -- SO YOU AYE I'VE

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:32.519
TALKED TO YOUR STAFF A LOTABOUT

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:33.553
THIS AND WE SPENT SOME TIME WITH

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.954
CD TFA AND FIRST THANK YOU BOTH

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:35.555

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:37.157
DIAPER BANK AND WITH YOUR

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:38.324
SERVICES.

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.493
CLEARLY TO MY COMMUNITY -- AND

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.028
WE DID TALK TO CD TO A FAN WE

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:42.929
TRIED TO FIND A WAY TO MEANS

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:44.564
TEST THIS AND THEY DID THINK

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:46.099
THEY HAD AN IDEA THE PROBLEM IS

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:46.800
THEY COULDN'T AUDIT THE

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:47.934
BUSINESSES.

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.469
AND AT ONE POINT I WAS LIKE WHO

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.905
CARES BUT I KNOW HOW HARD YOU

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:53.173
WORK ON THIS AND THERE'S A LARGE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.007
NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS ON THIS

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:55.041
COMMITTEE WHO HAVE WRITTEN A

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:56.576
LETTER TO BUDGET TO SUPPORT SOME

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:57.777
OF THE OTHER THINGS.

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.012
YOU HAVE DONE AN INCREASING YOUR

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.780
CAL WORKS BILL FROM THIRTY TO

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:01.815
FIFTY DOLLARS AND TO INCREASE

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.283
AND TO DO ANOTHER BUDGET

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:04.617
ALLOCATION TO DIAPER BANKS.

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.152
AND PART OF THE REASON I

01:52:06.219 --> 01:52:06.786
ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT IS

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.588
BECAUSE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS A

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:10.023
LITTLE BIT EVEN AS A MOM WHO

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:12.892
JUST WHO HAS A VERY YOUNG CHILD --

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:14.360
I WORRYING BECAUSE THEY DO WORK

01:52:14.427 --> 01:52:15.462
AT I AM SPENDING SO MUCH TIME

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.063
WORKING ON POVERTY AND THE WAY

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:18.731
THAT THIS -- COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.233
LOOKING AT THINGS THIS YEAR AS

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.334
WE LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:22.702
ANYTHING THAT TAKES MONEY OUT OF

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:24.104
THE GENERAL FUND.

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:25.738
AND SO FOR ME THE STRUGGLE WAS

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:28.308
DO WE ALLOW WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:32.245
BUY DESIGNER ORGANIC HONEST

01:52:32.312 --> 01:52:34.380
DIAPERS -- A SALES TAX EXEMPTION

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:35.782
DOES THAT TAKE IS THAT FAIR TO

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:36.683
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:38.084
TAKE THAT MONEY OUT OF THEIR

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.686
PROGRAMS THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:40.687
ALSO PROGRAMS.

01:52:40.753 --> 01:52:42.055
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:43.456
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WORKED VERY

01:52:43.523 --> 01:52:44.657
VERY HARD ON THIS.

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:45.725
I KNOW THIS IS INCREDIBLY

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:47.093
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.895
AND SO I HAVE ASKED YOU TO TAKE

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:49.896
SOME AMENDMENTS TO HAVE THIS

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.698
REVIEWED BY THE LA -- TO SEE IF

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:52.732
THIS IS REALLY THE MOST

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:54.400
SUCCESSFUL THING THAT WE CAN DO

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:56.703
FOR FAMILIES -- BUT I HAVE EVERY

01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.071

01:52:58.138 --> 01:52:59.572
EVERY INTENTION OF SUPPORTING

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:00.607
YOU WITH THIS I'VE TOLD YOU THAT

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.609
IN EVERY ITERATION THAT THIS IS

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:03.776
COME TO THIS COMMITTEE WHETHER

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:05.311
IT WAS A TRYING TO GET THE MONEY

01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:06.513
THROUGH AN ALCOHOL TAX OR

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.714
WHATEVER I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT.

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.548
I HAD EVERY INTENTION OF

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:09.883
SUPPORTING YOU WITH THIS HOWEVER

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.251
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S THE

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.485
RIGHT THING THAT WE'RE DOING THE

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:13.720
RIGHT THING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:14.721
IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT THERE

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.523
ISN'T ANOTHER DELIVERY MECHANISM

01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:17.724
TO MAKE SURE.

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:19.425
THAT WE ARE TRULY GETTING DOING

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:20.960
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I KNOW YOU

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.495
WANT TO DO AND THAT IS THE ONLY

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:24.731
GOAL THAT I HAVE OF THIS BILL.

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:25.598
WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:27.767
CLOSE SURE I WOULD JUST -- YOU

01:53:27.834 --> 01:53:29.569
KNOW AND I I A THANK YOU FOR

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:31.237
WORKING WITH US AND I AM HAPPY

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:34.607
TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS -- ONE

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:36.876
NOT HAPPY EVEN TAKE THEM.

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:38.044
THAT'S HOW AMENDMENTS GO IN THIS

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:41.848
BUILDING RIGHT -- SO.

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:42.515
I WOULD JUST SAY THIS YEAH I I

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:43.383
UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:47.387
THIS TEN WAYS -- TO TRY TO GET

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.289
TO THE A MEANS TEST I'M IT'S

01:53:49.355 --> 01:53:50.924
JUST NOT HOW SALES TAX WORKS

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.458
QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW UNLESS.

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:54.727
WE WANT TO EXEMPTS ORGANIC

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:57.430
EXPENSIVE DIAPERS THAT YOU NOW

01:53:57.497 --> 01:54:00.567
ARE OUT OF MAYBE A CERTAIN RANGE --

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:01.801
I THINK WE COULD DO THAT BUT IS

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:03.036
I I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:04.804
PROBLEMATIC IN OTHER WAYS -- THE

01:54:04.871 --> 01:54:06.806
FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.508
ANOTHER DISCUSSION GOING ON AND

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:10.109
ONE THAT I FULLY SUPPORT ABOUT

01:54:10.176 --> 01:54:10.877
TAMPON TAX.

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:13.279
AND WE'VE MOVED OUT FOR TIME AND

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:14.781
TIME AGAIN SAYING YOU KNOW THIS

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:17.984
IS UNFAIR TO WOMEN IT IS -- IT'S

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:20.253
A SMALL AMOUNT -- THAT IS MORE

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:22.722
BASED ON EQUITY THAN IT IS ON

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.557
ACTUAL COST BECAUSE THE COST OF

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:25.491
OF OF COURSE I'M FEMININE

01:54:25.558 --> 01:54:27.227
HYGIENE PRODUCTS IS TOO HIGH AS

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:27.660
WELL.

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:29.762
BUT THE THE TAXES IS SMALL BY

01:54:29.829 --> 01:54:30.597
COMPARISON OF COURSE WE HAVE

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:31.831
PAID OVER THE COURSE OF OUR

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.766
LIFETIME NOT JUST THAT YOURS OUR

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:34.434
CHILDREN ARE YOUNG.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.903
HOWEVER -- THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.338
MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT A

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:40.173
DISCUSSION ABOUT MEANS TESTING

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.041
OR ABOUT POVERTY AND I THINK

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:43.643
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.778
BECAUSE I THINK -- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:47.347
WE LOOK AT TAXES IN THE

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:48.548
REGRESSIVE NATURE OF ALL TAXES

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:50.016
IN THE FAIRNESS AROUND ALL TAXES

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.751
QUITE FRANKLY THE DIAPER TAX IS

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.519
NOT THAT DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:55.822
I I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS A

01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:58.625
POLICY -- DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.393
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT OF

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.628
THE MOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SAVED

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:03.696
IN A DIAPER TAX I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:05.598
LOOK AT ADDITIONAL TAXES ON THE

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:06.966
WEALTHY THAT HAVE CHILDREN AS A

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:09.102
FORM OF RECOUPING THE COST I'VE

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.670
NAY I'M NOT ONE THAT'S THAT

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:11.604
SHIES AWAY FROM.

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.406
YOU KNOW THAT TAXING FOLKS TO

01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:15.541
PAY FOR FOR WORTHWHILE PROJECTS

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:16.943
THAT THEY COULD THEY ARE REPORT

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.077
PROPOSALS SO THEY COULD PAY IN

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:19.345
ANOTHER WAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.514
LOOK AT ANY -- ANYTHING THAT

01:55:21.581 --> 01:55:23.283
THAT ANY ORGANIZATION COMES UP

01:55:23.349 --> 01:55:25.285
WITH AS WAY TO MEANS TEST IT.

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:26.052
WHAT I DON'T WANT THOUGH AND

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:27.553
I'LL BE CLEAR IS I DON'T WANT%

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.290
PEOPLE TO HAVE TO SHOW -- THAT

01:55:30.356 --> 01:55:31.224
THEY'RE ON WELFARE IN ORDER TO

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:32.692
GET A TAX EXEMPTION YOU KNOW I

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:35.295
DON'T WANT IT GOES BEYOND THAT I

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.195
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE TO

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:38.431
SHOW -- THAT THEIR POOR I IT YOU

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:40.767
KNOW I I'M A LITTLE SENSITIVE TO

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.502
TO THAT ISSUE AS WELL -- AND I

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:46.973
DON'T WANT IT TO BE A SITUATION

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.042
THAT DOESN'T ALSO ENCOMPASS --

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:49.676
ARE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS IN OUR

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:50.476
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:52.545
STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:54.180
THAT SO MANY OF OUR OUR POOR

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:55.748
FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING IT'S

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:57.383
EXPENSIVE TO HAVE CHILDREN.

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.619
IT'S USUALLY YOUNGER FOLKS NOT

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:00.586
ALWAYS BUT YOUNGER FOLKS WERE

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:01.854
THERE STARTED THEIR CAREER WHO

01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:04.157
OFTEN ARE YOU ARE SINGLE MOMS

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:05.858
WHO ARE OFTEN TRYING TO PIECE IT

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:06.826
ALL TOGETHER.

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:08.461
AN EXORBITANT NATURE OF THE

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:10.196
DIAPER TAX I WOULD ARGUE IS SO

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:12.231
UNIQUE AND NO OTHER TAX GOING OF

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.299
THAT YOU COULD ADDED UP AND

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.101
PROVIDE A FULL MONTH'S SUPPLY OF

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.936
DIAPERS WHICH WHICH WE KNOW THAT

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:18.404
MONEY IS DEFINITELY GOING

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:19.072
TOWARDS.

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:20.440
IF THERE IS A WAY TO BALANCE

01:56:20.506 --> 01:56:22.942
THAT OUT WITH -- WITH ENSURING

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:24.277
THAT THAT WEALTHY PEOPLE DON'T

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.112
BENEFIT UNNECESSARILY FROM THIS

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:27.947
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT I

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:28.581
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:29.415
CAN ENCOMPASS.

01:56:29.482 --> 01:56:30.817
THE MOST AMOUNT OF FAMILIES

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:33.052
POSSIBLE THAT REALLY DO DEAL

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:40.393
WITH US AS INITIAL.

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.362
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE LET'S SAY

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:43.930
SOME.

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:44.897
YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY IT'S A GOOD

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.532
POLICY DISCUSSION YOU BECAUSE I

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:47.533
I READ THE NOW SAYS ON TAMPON

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.101
TAX AND I'VE GONE ROUND AND

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:48.768
ROUND WITH MY OWN STUFF AND IT'S

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.503
LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:52.338
WHY -- EXCEPT THAT THERE IS AN

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:54.640
ADDICT IT COSTS MORE BECAUSE THE

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:57.810
SAVINGS IS MORE -- BUT BUT WHY

01:56:57.877 --> 01:57:00.313
SOME SALES TAX WE WOULD LOOK AT

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.548
AS A MEANS TEST AND OTHERS WE

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.150
WOULDN'T WE WE GOT ALL SALES TAX

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:05.918
IT'S MEANS TESTED WHICH I DON'T

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:07.687
KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT AND AND

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:08.788
QUITE AND QUITE HONESTLY I

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.223
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT BUT I

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:11.023
DON'T SEE IT.

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:12.358
IN MY OPINION I DON'T SEE THE

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:15.094
SAME THING THE SET FOR ME THE

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:16.896
TAMPON TAX IN THIS DO AREN'T THE

01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:19.665
EXACT SAME THING.

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:21.734
AND I AND WE ASK THE SAME

01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:22.969
QUESTIONS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:24.804
GARCIA AND THE REALITY IS IS TO

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:25.304
ME.

01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:27.039
I CAN'T HELP I MEAN I REALLY

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:28.241
HATE GOING I HATE HAVING THIS

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.442
CONVERSATION AND COMMITTEE

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:30.343
BECAUSE I'M NOT ONE TO TALK

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.911
ABOUT -- NO THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.880
THIS IS ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL

01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:36.749
DESIRE NOT TO TALK ABOUT TAMPONS --

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:39.051
BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY I DO

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:41.754
FEEL LIKE IT'S A NECESSITY TO I

01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:42.922
I MEAN I HAVE MY BEARD EVERY

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:44.023
MONTH THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO

01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:45.425
TO STOP THAT THAT IS A NECESSITY

01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.826
WHEREAS.

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:48.795
I LOVE HAVING MY CHILD MY CHILD

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:49.729
IS EVERYTHING THERE'S NOT A

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:51.497
PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO DOESN'T

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.032
KNOW HOW MUCH I WORSHIP MY CHILD.

01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:55.101
BUT IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:57.103
ME TO HAVE HER IN SO I WONDER I

01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:58.604
WORRY SOMETIMES.

01:57:58.671 --> 01:58:00.606
IF HOW WE QUALIFY THE WORD

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:02.208
NECESSITY AND I GUESS AND ONCE

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:03.342
YOU HAVE A CHILD YES A DIAPER I

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:04.944
BELIEVE IT IS A NECESSITY.

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:06.212
BUT A STRUGGLE WITH THAT AND

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:07.647
THAT'S AND THAT WAS WHY THERE

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:12.985
WAS A DIFFERENCE IN PART THAT

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.420
WAS WHY IN MY ANNOUNCED IN THE

01:58:14.487 --> 01:58:15.087
ANNOUNCES IN IN THE CONVERSATION

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:15.488
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.390
I DID NOT PUSH YOU LIKE I PUSHED

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:18.391
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASKED

01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:19.058
WHAT THE GOALS WERE BECAUSE I'VE

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:19.692
SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH YOU TO

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:20.893
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.261
KNOW WHAT YOUR GOAL IS.

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:24.564
BUT I STILL I DO QUESTION A FOR

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:25.364
GETTING TO THE RIGHT WAY AND I

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:27.200
KNOW IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WHICH

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:28.501
IS WHY THE AMENDMENTS ARE THE

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:28.835
WAY THEY ARE.

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:30.603
IT'S A WIDE IT IS EXACTLY

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.171
THEY'RE DESIGNED NOT TO HURT

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:33.239
THIS BILL BUT THEY'RE DESIGNED

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:35.041
TO MAKE SURE THAT OVER TIME IT

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.142
THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT ANSWER

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:37.710
AND WE FIND ANOTHER ANSWER AND

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:39.045
THERE IS A WAY TO MEANS TEST

01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:40.580
SEIZE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

01:58:40.646 --> 01:58:42.148
THAT WE HAVE THE OPTION TO DO

01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:43.549
THAT AND SO.

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:44.684
THESE AMENDMENTS ARGUED WITH THE

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:46.552
GOAL TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BECAUSE

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:47.854
THAT HAS BEEN MY GOAL BUT THEY

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.255
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE TOOL

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:50.857
BILLS IS THE SAME BUT I DO SEE

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:52.091
THE GOAL IS ONE YOU BOTH TO

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:52.892
SUCCEED.

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.293
AND BELIEVING THAT YOU BOTH HAVE

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.262
A POINT ON SOME LEVEL IN YOUR

01:58:56.329 --> 01:58:58.564
POLICY AND SO BE IT SO I JUST

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.199
WANNA MAKE I'M SURE I'M CLEAR.

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:02.268
THAT THAT THE GOAL HAS ALWAYS

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:04.136
BEEN TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:06.205
DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE ON ALL

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:06.873
OF YOUR REASONING A TIME TO GET

01:59:06.939 --> 01:59:08.040
AND THAT'S IT.

01:59:08.107 --> 01:59:09.642
AND I I RESPECTFULLY AYE AYE I

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:11.978
THINK THAT IS A GREAT POINT OF

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:16.716
DISCUSSION I IT I A I

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:18.384
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON SOME OF

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:19.418
THIS I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE.

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:20.553
I I THINK CHILD BIRTH

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.255
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:24.257
THAT CAN ALWAYS BE AVOIDED AT

01:59:24.323 --> 01:59:24.423
ACT.

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:27.693
IT'S I'M.

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.829
ALL RIGHT SO IT'S A NATURAL PART

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:31.531
OF THE HUMAN EXISTENCE IN LIFE

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:34.734
AND SO I DON'TWANT TO DEVALUE --

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.005
CHILDBIRTH IS A PART OF OF A A

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:39.372
MANY [inaudible]

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:40.973
PEOPLE'S [inaudible]

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.508
NATURAL.

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.310
FORM OF LIFE SO I I GUESS WE

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:45.211
WILL JUST.

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:47.213
HAVE TO DISAGREE ON THAT PORTION

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.015
OF IT OF COURSE -- BUT A I THINK

01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:50.349
WE COULD BOTH AGREE THAT A LOT

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:51.651
OF THINGS THAT ARE TAX FREE

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:53.286
THEY'RE A LOT MORE CHOICE STERN

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:54.820
AND SO [inaudible]

01:59:54.887 --> 01:59:58.124
ABSOLUTELY.

01:59:58.190 --> 01:59:59.025
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ON A QUICK --

01:59:59.091 --> 02:00:00.626
QUESTION HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE

02:00:00.693 --> 02:00:02.495
POSSIBILITY OF GIVING AND SEND

02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:03.863
IT TO THE MANUFACTURERS TO BE

02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:04.997
ABLE TO DONATE TO ORGANIZATIONS

02:00:05.064 --> 02:00:06.566
LIKE THIS AND PROVIDED TO THE

02:00:06.632 --> 02:00:07.934
PEOPLE FOR FREE.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.735
BUT ACTUALLY IT IS AS IT WAS

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:10.903
STARTED BY HUGGIES THE NATIONAL

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:13.906
DIAPER NETWORK IMPACT WE DO HAVE

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.875
A LOT OF INCENTIVES -- TO DONATE

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:18.177
TOWARDS DIAPER BANKS -- AND AND

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:19.779
THE DIAPER COMPANIES ACTUALLY DO

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:22.114
A LOT OF THAT AD THEY NEED TO

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.349
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

02:00:23.416 --> 02:00:25.017
YEAH I MEAN IT'S JUST STILL AND

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:27.086
AN EVER INCREASING NEED I MEAN I

02:00:27.153 --> 02:00:29.188
I OVERALL AND THIS IS A TOTALLY

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:30.623
DIFFERENT DISCUSSION BUT I THINK

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:30.923
WE SHOULD.

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:32.892
ASK WHY OUR DIAPERS AND FEMININE

02:00:32.959 --> 02:00:35.161
HYGIENE PRODUCTS SO EXPENSIVE --

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:37.863
BECAUSE IT IS A NEED AND SOMEHOW --

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:39.231
MANUFACTURES HAVE FOUND A WAY TO

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:40.766
CHARGE A LOT FOR THOSE I THINK

02:00:40.833 --> 02:00:42.068
THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:43.836
DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE BUT THE

02:00:43.903 --> 02:00:45.471
MANUFACTURERS HAVE -- AT LEAST

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:47.840
BEEN VERY POSITIVE AND THEY EVEN

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.742
ALLOW LIKE FOOD BANKS TO BUY IN

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:51.043
BULK AT DISCOUNTED RATES SO

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:52.044
THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WE WENT

02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:53.312
THE FOOD BANK ROUTE.

02:00:53.379 --> 02:00:55.181
UNFORTUNATELY WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:56.549
WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DELIVER

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.683
ENOUGH TO THE FOOD BANK'S

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.684
THROUGH CAL WORKS ACTUALLY

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.786
AFFECT ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.254
NEED AND WHO STRUGGLE WITH US

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.122
IT'S JUST.

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:05.257
NOT FEASIBLE -- WORKING FAMILIES

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:07.326
ARE GONNA ALL YOU UTILIZE THOSE

02:01:07.393 --> 02:01:12.031
RESOURCES AND SOMETIMES CAN'T

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:15.201
BECAUSE OF INCOME QUALIFICATIONS.

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:16.502
I THINK YOU CLOSE BUDGET LIKE

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:17.670
CLOSE AGAIN.

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:19.605
NOW JUST -- I I OBVIOUSLY

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:20.740
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BUT WHEN

02:01:20.806 --> 02:01:27.980

YOUR COMMITTEE.

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:02.548
WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICAL

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.316
CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR DISABLED

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:05.117
VETERANS.

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:06.652
VETERANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.654
AFFECTED BY HEALTH ISSUES LIKE

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:11.490
CHRONIC PAIN AND POST TRAUMATIC

02:02:11.557 --> 02:02:12.858
STRESS DISORDER FOLLOWING TO

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:15.227
SERVICE CURRENTLY VETERANS LACKS

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:17.063
ADEQUATE ACCESS TO MEDICAL

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:19.165
CANNABIS TO TREAT.

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:20.533
THESE CONDITIONS AND VETERANS

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:23.903
OUT HEAVILY RELY RELY ON OPIATES.

02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:25.104
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:26.539
US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:28.641

02:02:34.013 --> 02:02:35.881
THE VA ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE

REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MEDICAL

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:39.218

UNDER UTILIZED BY VETERANS

02:02:45.157 --> 02:02:46.592
BECAUSE MANY OF THEM FEAR LOSING

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:48.427
THEIR FEDERAL HEALTH BENEFITS IF

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:49.762
THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEING

THEIR DISABILITY STATUS AT A

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:08.080
DISPENSARY.

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:09.682
IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL

02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.350
ENCOURAGE VETERANS TO BUY FROM

AND THE VETERANS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:44.750
WORKING WITH ON THIS WHEN THE

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:45.785
TREASURER WAS AT THE BOARD OF

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:47.019
EQUALIZATION SHE WAS VERY

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:48.387
INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL CANNABIS

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:49.822
ISSUES AS A COLLECTOR OF THE

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:51.257
TAXES AT THAT TIME.

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:52.224
AND WE CAN BRING CONVENE A

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.559
WORKING GROUP TO DISCUSS ISSUES

02:03:53.626 --> 02:03:55.060
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:56.295
LEGISLATURE.

02:03:56.362 --> 02:03:57.163
IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WE LEARNED

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:58.898
THAT VETERANS WERE NOT REALLY

02:03:58.964 --> 02:03:59.498
UTILIZING THE MEDICAL CAMPUS

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:01.000
CAMPUS MARKET WE WANTED TO WORK

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:02.668
ON A WAY TO BRING MORE INTO

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:04.069
THEIR LEGAL REGULATED MARKET.

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:05.171
THEY CAN RELY LESS ON HARMFUL

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:06.405
OPIOIDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:07.973
PRESCRIBED TO OUR VETERANS WE

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.508
KNOW THAT TWENTY TWO VETERANS A

02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:11.243
DAY ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE.

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:13.679
AND WE KNOW THAT IS 21% HIGHER

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:15.381
THAN OTHER ADULTS IN THE U. S.

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:16.715
THIS IS A TRAVESTY IN THE STATE

02:04:16.782 --> 02:04:18.250
NEEDS TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR

02:04:18.317 --> 02:04:19.785
POWER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:21.187
WE WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:22.221
ENSURE THAT VETERANS WHO ARE

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:23.756
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL CARDS COULD

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:25.257
RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFITS OF THE

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:26.292
CARD WHILE ADDRESSING THE

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:27.860
CONCERNS WE WERE HEARING FROM

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:28.794
VETERANS.

02:04:28.861 --> 02:04:30.863
AND AB FIFTEEN SIXTY NINE IS A

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:32.498
CULMINATION OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:33.899
A RECOVERY FIRST STUDY STATES

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:35.100
THAT NOT ONLY ARE VETERANS WITH

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:36.468
MENTAL HEALTH AND CHRONIC PAIN

02:04:36.535 --> 02:04:37.870
PROBLEMS MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:39.004
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:40.339
BUT THAT THE COMBINATION OF

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.707
OPIOIDS AND SEDATIVES PUTS THE

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:43.375
MEN INCREASED RISK OF ACCIDENTAL

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:45.244
OVERDOSES WE ALSO FOUND THE

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:47.246
STUDY THAT OPIOIDS ARE TIED TO

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:51.050
AN EIGHT TIMES HIGHER RISK OF

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.117
DEATH FOR FEMALE VETERANS.

PRESSURES THAT BY THIS LANGUAGE

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:45.738
WOULD BE OFFSET BY HAVING A NEW

CONSUMER BASE.

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:48.507
THE ALREADY IS SUPPOSED TO BE

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:49.575
INCLUDED IN THAT MARKET.

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:50.442
SINCE WE'RE HEARING FROM

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:51.343

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.819
SO BY INCLUDING THEM IN THIS.

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:01.854
THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY BRING

02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:03.489
IN TWO OUT OF THREE OF THOSE

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:04.123

USING THAT MEDICAL CARD --

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.030
FURTHERMORE THE US DEPARTMENT OF

VETERANS AFFAIRS -- AS ANY

02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:14.466
ANALYSIS THE WEBSITE STATES THAT

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:15.901
THE VA PARTICIPATION IN STATE

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:16.902
MARIJUANA PROGRAMS DOES NOT

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.504
AFFECT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VA

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.539
CARD SERVICES.

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:21.941
MORE OVER THE VA NOTES THAT --

02:06:22.007 --> 02:06:23.642
VA PROVIDERS CAN CAN AND DO

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:24.710
DISCUSS MARIJUANA USE WITH

02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:26.378
VETERANS AS PART OF

02:06:26.445 --> 02:06:28.647
COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLANNING --

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:29.648
CANNABIS IS STILL A SCHEDULE ONE

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:31.383
DRUG AS SUCH THE VA DOCTORS

02:06:31.450 --> 02:06:32.718
CANNOT PRESCRIBE MEDICAL

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:34.286
CANNABIS EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T

02:06:34.353 --> 02:06:35.421
DISCUSS.

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:36.889
OF MARIJUANA AND ITS BENEFITS.

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:38.223
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE POLICY

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:42.227
BY THE VA IS JUST THAT IT'S A

02:06:42.294 --> 02:06:43.095
POLICY IT'S NOT MANDATED.

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:43.896
AND SO THIS COULD BE CHANGE

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:44.430
BASED ON THE WHIMS OF THE

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:45.664
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:47.333
HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TO

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:49.668
ENSURE OUR STATE'S POLICIES

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:51.170
PROVIDE PROTECTION WHERE WE CAN

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.671

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:53.439
OUR STATE GIVE THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT'S VOLATILE GIVEN THE

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:55.574
FEDERAL.

02:06:55.641 --> 02:06:57.109
GOVERNMENT VOLATILE RELATIONSHIP

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:59.712
WITH THE ISSUE AB FIFTEEN SIXTY

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.380
NINE INSURERS VETERANS ARE NOT

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:02.815
NEGATIVELY IMPACT SHOULD A

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:04.683
CHANGE IN VA POLICY OCCUR AND

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.085
ADDRESSES THE VETERANS CONCERNS.

02:07:06.151 --> 02:07:07.619
AND THEN I ALSO HAVE SOME

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:10.789
INFORMATION ON PENDING.

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:13.692
LEGISLATION AND STATES IN AT THE

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:14.326
FEDERAL LEVEL AND THERE ALSO IS

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:14.960
A CAR.

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.628
A COURT CASE IN NEVADA AS WELL

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.230
AS A SUPREME COURT CASE ON THIS

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:19.832
ISSUE SO THAT'S WHY WE FEEL IT

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:21.600
IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FOR

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:23.068
CALIFORNIA TO ACT. TO ENSURE

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:24.203
THAT OUR VETERANS HAVE THE

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:26.839
ACCESS THEY NEED TO THIS AND SO

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:28.507

UNLESS THE VETERAN BRINGS IT UP

02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:39.511

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:38.123
ON SO IF YOU HAVE YOUR DOCTOR'S

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:41.360
RECOMMENDATION -- FROM AND A

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:42.761
DOCTOR OUTSIDE OF THE VA BECAUSE

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:45.664
OF THE VA DOCTORS WILL NOT ISSUE.

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.366
A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT

02:11:47.432 --> 02:11:49.501
IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS YOU --

02:11:49.568 --> 02:11:50.836
BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:54.640
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE A LOT OF

02:11:54.706 --> 02:11:55.941
VETERANS WHO HAVE.

02:11:56.008 --> 02:11:57.209
I PTSD OR OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL

02:11:57.276 --> 02:11:58.744
ISSUES WHERE THEY'RE CONCERNED

02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:00.679
ABOUT BEING ON A LIST -- THEY

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:02.247
DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW GET THE

02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:04.783
STATE ID CARD BECAUSE OF THIS

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:06.351
FEAR.

02:12:06.418 --> 02:12:07.953
HER IF I MAY.

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:09.454
YOU HAVEN'T LOST YOUR BENEFITS.

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.223
RIGHT I'M ONE PERSON OUT OF THE

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:13.325
TWO MILLION VETERANS IN

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:13.725
CALIFORNIA CELLS.

02:12:13.792 --> 02:12:14.726
SO.

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.495
DO YOU NEED IS THERE A NUMBER

02:12:16.561 --> 02:12:17.562
THAT YOU KNOW OF A VETERANS WHO

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:19.097
HAVE LOST THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE

02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:21.266
OF MARIJUANA USE MEDICAL

02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:22.968
MARIJUANA USE -- SO WE DON'T

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.169
HAVE A NUMBER BUT THE REASON

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.537
THAT THERE IS THIS FEAR IS

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:26.972
BECAUSE THERE ARE COURT CASES

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:29.875
PENDING SO IN -- AT THE FEDERAL

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.877
LEVEL ROMAN VERSE WOULD OCCUR --

02:12:31.943 --> 02:12:33.578
ROMAN ASSERTS THAT THE NINETEEN

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:34.146
SIXTY EIGHT GUN CONTROL ACT

02:12:34.212 --> 02:12:35.480
VIOLATES THE SECOND AMENDMENT AS

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:36.448
WELL AS HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:37.282
RIGHTS AGAINST SELF

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:38.483
INCRIMINATION.

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:39.785
BECAUSE OF FEDERAL FIREARM

02:12:39.851 --> 02:12:41.253
TRANSACTION FORMS REQUIRE

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.221
MEDICAL THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:45.090
WITH.

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:47.059
HAVING BE A BENEFIT. FOR YOU

02:12:47.125 --> 02:12:47.959
WHAT KIND OF GUN OWNERSHIP RIGHT

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:48.894
BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT WHEN

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:49.494
THEY FILL OUT THEIR FORMS FOR

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:51.029
THE GUNS IS AS MEDICAL MARIJUANA

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:52.664
USERS TO REPORT ON IT REQUIRES

02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:53.932
AND REPORT THE USE OF DRUGS

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.434
UNLAWFULLY EVEN WHEN IT IS LEGAL

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.601
IN THEIR STATE.

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:57.869
SO THEY'RE WORRIED THAT SINCE

02:12:57.936 --> 02:13:00.339
THAT FORM REQUIRES THEM TO EVEN

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:01.006
THOUGH IT'S LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:02.474
THE FORM SAYS IT'S ILLEGAL FOR

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.508
THEM TO USE THAT THEY'RE WORRIED

02:13:03.575 --> 02:13:04.109
THAT WHEN THEY'RE PULLING UP

02:13:04.176 --> 02:13:05.310
THAT FORM THEY'RE COMMITTING

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:06.812
SOME SORT OF PERJURY IN THERE

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:07.379
WHERE THAT'S GOING TO FACTOR

02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:08.246
BENEFITS.

02:13:08.313 --> 02:13:09.214
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:10.716
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A SAFETY

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.084
MEASURE IN OUR STATE.

02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:13.485
OKAY I'M CONFUSED HOW WOULD THEY

02:13:13.552 --> 02:13:19.291
BE COMMITTING PERJURY IF THE

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:20.959
ANSWER THE QUESTION HONESTLY.

02:13:21.026 --> 02:13:22.494
BECAUSE THERE IT'S LEGAL IN

02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:23.095
CALIFORNIA SO THEY THINK IT'S

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:23.895
LEGAL FOR THEM TO USE IT BUT

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:25.163
IT'S SAYING ON THIS FORM.

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:25.864
THAT IT'S UNLAWFUL EVEN WHEN IT

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:26.965
IS LEGAL IN THE STATE AND

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:27.733
THEREFORE AUTOMATICALLY

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:28.834
DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM THE

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.736
APPLICATION PROCESS AGAIN I'M

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:33.038
ASKING ABOUT VA BENEFITS I'M NOT

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:34.940
ASKING ABOUT GUN OWNERSHIP.

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:36.007
SO I DO KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING IS

02:13:36.074 --> 02:13:38.844
WHO HAS LOST THEIR VA BENEFITS

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:40.212
BECAUSE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA USE

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.047
SO VETERANS THAT ARE IN OPIOID

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.716
OR PAIN MEDICATION PROGRAMS.

02:13:44.783 --> 02:13:47.018
THOSE THOSE VETERANS IF THEY

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:48.854
HAVE A URINALYSIS THAT HAS --

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.021
CANNABIS IN IT THEY ARE

02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:52.824
POTENTIALLY AT RISK FOR LOSING

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:55.827
THAT THAT BENEFIT OKAY BUT

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:57.496
VETERANS WHO ARE ON SOME SORT OF

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:58.930
PAIN MANAGEMENT.

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.799
THERAPY ARE NOT GIVEN A RANDOM

02:14:00.866 --> 02:14:02.067
URINALYSIS TO CHECK TO COULD

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:04.069
VERY ON VERY BEING PRESCRIBED

02:14:04.136 --> 02:14:05.404
OPIOID SO THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE

02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:06.505
ANY SENSE SOME OF THIS A ARE

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.239
ACTUALLY.

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:09.141
WHEN THEY TAKE YOUR BLOOD

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:11.209
THEY'LL THEY TEST EVERYTHING --

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:12.010
BUT THEY'RE NOT TESTING YOU FOR

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:14.079
MARIJUANA.

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:16.281
NOW I'M NOT ON THE ROOMS RIGHT.

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.249
BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO THAT

02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:17.549
[inaudible]

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.351
I'M [inaudible]

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:21.686
SO.

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:25.857
YOU ARE ASKING.

02:14:25.924 --> 02:14:30.028
I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:32.097
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T WANT.

02:14:32.164 --> 02:14:33.832
VETERANS TO HAVE TO GET THE

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:36.835
STATE ISSUED MEDICAL CANNABIS

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.170
CARD.

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:38.804
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT IS THIS

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:40.372
BILL RIGHT SKINNER WANT THEM TO

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:42.574
HAVE THE TAX EXEMPTION WANT TO

02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:44.376
HAVE TAX EXEMPTION OKAY SO IT IS

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:46.678
A FEAR AMONG VETERANS.

02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:47.879
THAT IF THEY GET THE CARD FROM

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:49.548
WHEN I STAND THAT COULD TRIGGER

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.283
SOMETHING IS MORE THE FEAR THAT

02:14:51.349 --> 02:14:52.884
THIS COULD TRIGGER SOMETHING

02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:53.351
THAT WOULD.

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:54.419
OKAY ONE LAST TIME KEEP GOING

02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:56.788
BACK TO IS YOU HAVEN'T PRESENTED.

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.557
ANYTHING THAT MAKES ANY SENSE AT

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:01.760
SAYS THE FEAR IS LOGICAL BECAUSE

02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:02.861
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:03.462
NOBODY HAS LOST ANY BENEFITS

02:15:03.528 --> 02:15:05.964
NOTHING SO.

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:07.065
BUT THAT'S ALSO BECAUSE LIKE

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.433
GOOD SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.302
PROBLEM BUT WHAT IT'S NOT THE

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:11.269
BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK TO THE

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:12.504
VETERANS BECAUSE OF THAT FEAR

02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:13.805
THEY'RE NOT ENTERING THE MARKET

02:15:13.872 --> 02:15:14.673
SO THEY'RE NOT LOSING THEIR

02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:15.874
BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:17.375
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS.

02:15:17.442 --> 02:15:18.343
THEY'RE WORRIED IF THEY GO

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:19.377
THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY WILL IN

02:15:19.444 --> 02:15:20.979
TURN LOSE THEIR BENEFITS ARE NOT

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:22.481
ENTERING THE LEGAL MARKET SO WE

02:15:22.547 --> 02:15:23.648
DON'T HAVE NUMBERS SO WE'RE

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.250
TRYING TO IN THIS BILL IS VERY

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:26.751
NARROW. TO JUST SERVICE

02:15:26.818 --> 02:15:29.821

IN ORDER TO GET THIS TAX

EXEMPTION IS THAT JOIN US IN A

I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TRYING.

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:43.061
THIS PUTS THEM IN A WEIRD

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.729
PREDICAMENT IF THEY ARE.

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.097
THEY'RE USING FIRST OF ALL THAT

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:48.400
THAT FEDERALLY ISSUE CARD THAT

NOT USING THE OPTION OR TRYING

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:40.485
TO CREATE AND FACILITATE ANOTHER

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:41.853
WAY TO GET THAT SAME EFFECT.

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.755
AND I CAN DEFINITELY LOOK FOR

02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:46.925
SOME NUMBERS FOR YOU.

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:47.926
OKAY.

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:49.995
FIND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRO.

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:50.562
THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:52.230
SERVICE SOME AN ARMY VETERAN

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.098
MYSELF.

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.532
I THINK WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO

02:17:54.599 --> 02:17:56.234
IS.

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.569
YOU'RE DEALING WITH FEDERAL VA

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.503
BENEFITS IN THE FEDERAL

02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:00.705
GOVERNMENT STILL CONSIDERS

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:02.540
MARIJUANA ILLEGAL SO NO V. A

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.476
DOCTOR IS GOING TO TALK TO OF

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:07.646
THAT ROUND ABOUT MARIJUANA.

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:08.446
SO WE'RE KIND OF IN MIDDLE

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:10.482
GROUND OF FEDERAL LAW A FEDERAL

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:11.783
AGENCY YET.

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:14.052
STATE A CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR

02:18:14.119 --> 02:18:15.720
MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL USE

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:16.821
OF MARIJUANA.

02:18:16.888 --> 02:18:18.556
SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST

02:18:18.623 --> 02:18:20.558
ISSUE WHERE.

02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:23.028
I GET ALL THE GETTING PEOPLE OFF

02:18:23.094 --> 02:18:24.763
OPIOIDS AND IF SOMEBODY THINKS

02:18:24.829 --> 02:18:27.298
MARIJUANA HELPS THEM GREAT.

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:30.402
BUT I DON'T THINK OUR BILL OR

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:31.836
ANY STATE BILL.

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.772
IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MIND OF

02:18:33.838 --> 02:18:35.573
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNTIL

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:37.342
THEY SAY MARIJUANA IS NOT A

02:18:37.409 --> 02:18:39.177
LEGAL THE THE FEDERAL Vì ã

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:43.415
IS NOT GONNA START LETTING --

02:18:43.481 --> 02:18:45.116
YOU KNOW DOCTOR STALKER LET.

02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:47.085
PATIENTS.

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:48.386
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:50.522
HONESTLY AND BUT I WOULD BE

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:51.690
INTERESTED IN STARTING A

02:18:51.756 --> 02:18:53.391
CONVERSATION TO SEE [inaudible]

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:57.128
OUR IS IT SOMETHING THAT THE VA

02:18:57.195 --> 02:19:00.298
SAYS IF SOMEONE USES MARIJUANA.

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:02.600
DOES THAT SUBJECT THEM TO

02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.235
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:19:04.302 --> 02:19:06.304
WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN THE

02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:07.472
VA SYSTEM.

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:09.441
I I I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET BUT

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:11.443
DO YOU DO YOU NOW IF IF THAT'S

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:12.310
THE CASE IF.

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:13.611
IF THE VA'S MY PRIMARY

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:15.013
HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO YOU KNOW

THAT AND YOU USE MARIJUANA IN A

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:24.589

02:19:24.656 --> 02:19:27.992
JEOPARDIZE YOUR VETERAN BENEFITS.

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:30.595
IT GETS A CAMPER TENSELY IF YOU

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.497
I KNOW VETERANS THAT ARE IN

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:34.466
PROGRAMS WITH THE VA WHERE THEY

02:19:34.532 --> 02:19:36.134
HAVE TO SHOW THEIR DOCTOR'S

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:37.435
RECOMMENDATION.

02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:39.070
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.472
THEIR BENEFITS BECAUSE OF

URINALYSIS FOR BLOOD WORK TESTS

02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:43.675
THAT WOULD SHOW OF THE V. EIGHT

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:45.110
TAKE A CALIFORNIA THE

02:19:45.176 --> 02:19:48.780
RECOMMENDATION FROM A CALIFORNIA.

02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:49.547
IF YOU HAVE TO BE IN A STATE

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.616
THAT HAS A OF MEDICAL CARE

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:53.451
PROGRAM AND THEN YOU HAVE TO

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:55.120
HAVE A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION

02:19:55.186 --> 02:19:56.888
TO BACK THAT UP A VALID.

02:19:56.955 --> 02:19:58.456
ONE SO THE THE OF A FEDERAL VA

02:19:58.523 --> 02:20:01.192
HOSPITAL OR CLINIC WILL TAKE.

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:03.495
A MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR AYE

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.296
MARIJUANA RECOMMENDATION.

02:20:05.363 --> 02:20:06.831
THEY'LL TAKE IT IN THE SENSE

02:20:06.898 --> 02:20:09.167
THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE STATE

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:10.335
MEDICAL PROGRAM.

AND ARE USING IT FOR MEDICINAL

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:13.705
PURPOSES AND THE FACT THAT YOU

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:15.473
CAN'T -- THE DOCTORS CAN'T TELL

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:17.108

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:18.576

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.957
PROGRAM.

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:34.526
SO YES THERE ARE THERE ARE Vì

NOT IN STATES THAT HAVE MEDICAL

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:41.399
PROGRAMS AND THOSE THOSE

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:43.501
VETERANS ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:46.004
LOSING ANY TYPE OF SERVICE OR

WHERE DO SO MY OWN RESEARCH I

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:52.443
SERVED IN THE BUSH

ADMINISTRATION TO FEE A FROM --

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.548
200-012-0004 THIS WASN'T AN

02:20:56.614 --> 02:20:58.016
ISSUE BACK THEN OBVIOUSLY -- BUT

02:20:58.082 --> 02:20:59.017
I'M GONNA DO MY OWN RESEARCH AND

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.418
SEE IF IT JEOPARDIZES VETERANS

02:21:00.485 --> 02:21:03.021
BENEFITS -- I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:04.622
TALKING ABOUT A SIX TAX.

YOU KNOW EXEMPTION HERE BUT IT

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:09.160
KIND OF OPENS UP A BROADER ISSUE --

02:21:09.227 --> 02:21:10.695
MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO GET

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:11.896
REFERRED TO HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:13.698
IT IT IT DOES REACH A LOT OF

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:14.799
THINGS HERE MEAN YOU'RE TALKING

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:16.201
ABOUT STATE FEDERAL.

02:21:16.267 --> 02:21:19.938
HEALTHCARE TAXATION SO -- I KNOW

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:20.738
OUR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT I'M GONNA

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:23.775
DO MY OWN RESEARCH BEFORE YOU

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:26.411
BACK TO VOTE ONLY AND FIND OUT.

02:21:26.477 --> 02:21:27.846
RUNNING HIS ANSWER AND FOR IF

02:21:27.912 --> 02:21:30.215
YOU DON'T MIND. TO CHAIR OF I

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:33.017
KNOW THIS IS A REAL CONCERN WITH

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:33.985
THE VETERANS AND WHETHER IT'S A

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:35.386
A PERCEIVED REALITY IT'S A

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:36.754
REALITY TO THEM.

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:39.123
AND OBVIOUSLY LOSING.

02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:42.327
YOUR MEDICAL BENEFITS AT THE VA --

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:43.828
COULD BE THE LIFE THREATENING

02:21:43.895 --> 02:21:46.064
AND SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT

02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.999
NOT ONLY IF YOU CHECKED IN

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:50.635
BECAUSE I'M NOT A VETERAN OF SEE.

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:52.170
ASSEMBLY WILL MELENDEZ HAS A

02:21:52.237 --> 02:21:53.471
BETTER IN THIS GENTLEMAN'S A

02:21:53.538 --> 02:21:57.275
VETERAN -- AND I KNOW IF WE WANT

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:58.743
TO DO IT.

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:01.880
YEAH WE WE REALLY WANT TO FIND

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:03.181
OUT THE STATE.

02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:03.815
BECAUSE IN THE ORIGINAL BILL WE

02:22:03.882 --> 02:22:05.283
DID HAVE THAT YOU HAVE A CARD IN

02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:06.885
THERE WE GOT PUSHED BACK FROM

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:07.752
VETERANS THAT WERE.

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:10.788
WERE VERY FEARFUL THAT THEY

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:12.523
WOULD LOSE THEIR BENEFITS AND

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.091
PART OF THE CHANGE IS MAKING

02:22:13.157 --> 02:22:13.725
SURE.

02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:14.659
THAT WE AND JEOPARDIZE THAT.

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:15.493
AND I JUST OUT WANT TO ADD THAT

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.494
WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING OF

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:17.962
VETERANS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:18.930
WE WERE VERY AWARE THAT WE

02:22:18.997 --> 02:22:19.697
DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:21.432
BROAD ALLOW MORE PEOPLE INTO

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:22.901
THAT MARKET THEN WERE INTENDED.

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:24.002
SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH THE

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:25.503
VETERANS THAT USE THE VA CARD

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:27.005
THIS IS SERVICE CONNECTED

02:22:27.071 --> 02:22:28.907
DISABILITY ON THAT CARD BECAUSE

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:30.275
THAT MEANS A V. A DOCTOR SAW

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:30.875
THEM.

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:32.610
SAW THAT THERE DISABILITIES WERE

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:34.012
DIRECTLY LINKED TO THEIR SERVICE

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:35.546
AND SO WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

02:22:35.613 --> 02:22:36.915
SOME SORT OF SEVERE DISABILITY

02:22:36.981 --> 02:22:38.182
WHERE THEY NEED SOME SORT OF

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:38.883
MEDICATION.

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:40.018
A LOT OF THEM WANT TO RELY ON

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:42.220

WHICH ENDED UP TRANSFERRING HIGH

02:33:29.266 --> 02:33:32.469
PAID UNION JOBS.

02:33:32.536 --> 02:33:34.471
TO AREAS OF THAT IT MERELY

02:33:34.538 --> 02:33:36.440
NEEDED JOBS BUT THEN SENDING

02:33:36.507 --> 02:33:39.343
THEM TO MINIMUM WAGE -- THE

02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:40.711
OPPORTUNITIES JONES IN TERMS OF

02:33:40.778 --> 02:33:41.979
WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE COST OF

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.414
HOUSING ALREADY.

02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:46.517
IS CRAZY -- I THINK WOULD BE

02:33:46.584 --> 02:33:47.718
BETTER OFF WITHOUT THE PROGRAM.

02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:50.254
MAYBE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:54.658
BUT THERE ANYWAY WE CAN OPT OUT

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:56.827
IF IT IS A STATE.

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:58.362
SO AM I I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.996
YOU IF IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN

02:33:59.063 --> 02:34:00.030
ACTUAL QUESTION AND YOU'VE

02:34:00.097 --> 02:34:01.031
IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE

02:34:01.098 --> 02:34:02.366
CONCERNS AMONG A LOT OF FOLKS

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:04.001
ABOUT OPPORTUNITY ZONES --

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:05.202
CONVERSELY THERE A LOT OF FOLKS

02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:06.770
THAT SEE THEM AS A AS A LOT OF

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.138
OPPORTUNITY SO FOLKS WHO SEE A

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:08.739
POTENTIAL CHALLENGE HERE AND

02:34:08.806 --> 02:34:09.473
ALSO.

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.941
REAL OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.543
INVESTMENT PRIVATE INVESTMENT

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:14.511
CAPITAL INTO CENSUS TRACKS

02:34:14.578 --> 02:34:15.913
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:16.513
THEY COULD NEED TO INVEST THE

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:17.815
CAPITAL.

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:19.116
THE BIGGER QUESTION FOR US IS

02:34:19.183 --> 02:34:20.784
SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE A VOICE

02:34:20.851 --> 02:34:21.685
IN DIRECTING HOW THAT CAPITAL

02:34:21.752 --> 02:34:23.454
WAS ALLOCATED AND WHAT THIS TAX

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.589
CREDIT IS SAYING IS THAT YOU MAY

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:26.857
LIKE OPPORTUNITY ZONES YOU MAY

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:28.225
HATE THE IDEA.

02:34:28.292 --> 02:34:29.193
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE OF

02:34:29.259 --> 02:34:30.094
CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:32.396
EXPRESS SOME PRIORITIES WITH

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:33.263
INVESTED.

02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:34.398
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.399
GOVERNOR HAS SAID THAT A PART OF

02:34:35.466 --> 02:34:36.934
FINANCES SAID THAT YOU KNOW IN

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.202
SEEKING TO DO TAX CONFORMITY AND

02:34:38.268 --> 02:34:38.969
THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE

02:34:39.036 --> 02:34:39.637
DETAILS.

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.005
THEY BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA

02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.740
SHOULD PRIOR TO PRIORITIZE

02:34:42.806 --> 02:34:44.174
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CENSUS

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:45.809
TRACKS SO I THINK THE QUESTION

02:34:45.876 --> 02:34:47.044
FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IS

02:34:47.111 --> 02:34:48.812
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:49.446
ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT

02:34:49.513 --> 02:34:50.114
WAS A FACT THAT WAS A PIECE OF

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.482
FEDERAL LEGISLATION.

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:53.050
THAT IN FACT THE CENSUS TRACKS

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:54.818
HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED ALL EIGHT

02:34:54.885 --> 02:34:55.419
HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OF ON THE

02:34:55.486 --> 02:34:56.687
QUESTION IS SHOULD CALIFORNIA

02:34:56.754 --> 02:34:58.522
HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS TO

02:34:58.589 --> 02:34:59.123
MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:00.824
PUBLIC BENEFITS AND I THINK THE

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:01.325
ANSWER TO THAT IS YES.

02:35:01.392 --> 02:35:05.529
WELL MY PROBLEM IS THAT IT

02:35:05.596 --> 02:35:06.930
SOUNDS IS HALF.

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.065
JUST THE COST OF THE LAND IS

02:35:08.132 --> 02:35:09.366
ENOUGH TO NULLIFY.

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:11.101
I MEAN IT IT'S BETTER OFF

02:35:11.168 --> 02:35:12.936
WITHOUT YEAR TAX CREDIT BUT THE

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.538
COST OF THE LAND MAY BE IT MAY

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:15.439
EVEN.

02:35:15.506 --> 02:35:17.608
NULLIFY THE IMPACT OF YOUR TAX

02:35:17.675 --> 02:35:18.208
CREDIT TO THE POINT WHERE IT

02:35:18.275 --> 02:35:21.111
BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT EVEN WITH

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:23.013
YOUR TAX CREDIT TO BELT.

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:24.782
I THINK WHAT I AND AND FEEL FREE

02:35:24.848 --> 02:35:25.616
TO DROP I THINK WHAT I HEARD IS

02:35:25.683 --> 02:35:26.617
THAT IS THAT THERE IS ANECDOTAL

02:35:26.684 --> 02:35:28.152
EVIDENCE THAT ARE REASONS TO BE

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:29.520
CONCERNED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:30.788
OWNS I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE

02:35:30.854 --> 02:35:32.356
HAS THE HARD DATA YET TO SAY.

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.191
THAT THESE YOU KNOW ACROSS THE

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:35.759
BOARD ARE GOING TO BE TERRIBLE

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:37.828
AND LEAD -- TO YOU KNOW EXTREME

02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:39.830
RESULTS BUT I THINK GIVEN WHAT

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:41.398
WE KNOW IN A TOTALLY.

02:35:41.465 --> 02:35:42.166
AND ALSO GIVEN WHAT WE

02:35:42.232 --> 02:35:43.667
UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW THIS MARKET

02:35:43.734 --> 02:35:45.836
FUNCTIONS GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW

02:35:45.903 --> 02:35:47.137
ABOUT OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS.

02:35:47.204 --> 02:35:48.839
OUR BEST OPTION AT THIS POINT IS

02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:50.207
TO WEIGH IN AND TO DO SOMETHING

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:51.775
THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO THE

02:35:51.842 --> 02:35:52.843
CONSTRUCTION OF MORE AFFORDABLE

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.178
HOUSING AND ALSO PREVENT

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.979
DISPLACEMENT IT JUST TO BE CLEAR.

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.481
THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:59.349
RIGHT ONE OF THEM IS A HUNDRED

02:35:59.416 --> 02:36:00.417
MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT THAT'S

02:36:00.484 --> 02:36:02.419
FOCUSED ON PREVENTING

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:04.321
DISPLACEMENT THE OTHER IS A TWO

02:36:04.388 --> 02:36:05.155
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CREDIT

02:36:05.222 --> 02:36:06.290
THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE

02:36:06.356 --> 02:36:07.691
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AFFORDABLE

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:09.626
HOUSING. TO BRING A NEW UNITS ON

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:10.994
MARKET WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO AS

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.596
LEVERAGE WHAT WE EXPECTED TO BE

02:36:12.663 --> 02:36:13.864
A SIGNIFICANT.

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.532
AND FUSION OF CAPITAL INTO THESE

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:17.701
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS RATHER THAN

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:19.903
TO BE A SHOPPING MALL OR A HIGH

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:22.740
END RESTAURANT IT WILL FOCUS

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:23.340
THOSE DOLLARS INTO AFFORDABLE

02:36:23.407 --> 02:36:24.074
HOUSING.

02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:27.478
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:36:27.544 --> 02:36:28.112
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

02:36:28.178 --> 02:36:30.981

BACK A MOMENT FROM SOME OF THE

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.759
DISCUSSION HERE THE THE BIGGER

02:36:41.825 --> 02:36:42.392
QUESTION I THINK FOR THE

02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:44.328
COMMITTEE TO ANSWER TODAY AND I

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:44.862
THINK THE GOVERNOR SOARED

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:45.896
ANSWERED AS IT SHOULD CALIFORNIA

02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:46.997
HAVE A VOICE.

02:36:47.064 --> 02:36:49.366
IN DIRECTING THIS.

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:50.000
SPENDING AROUND OPPORTUNITY SO

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:52.035
IT'S SHOULD WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:48.271
THIS ADDRESSES THE CHRONIC

INSTABILITY OF THOSE IN DEEP

IT SIMPLY STABILIZE THEIR LIVES

02:41:13.497 --> 02:41:15.699
SUFFICIENTLY SO THEY CAN BEGIN

TO MOVE OUT OF DEEP POVERTY AND

02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:19.302
TAKE ADVANTAGE.

02:41:19.369 --> 02:41:20.937
OF THE ONLY OF THE OTHER.

02:41:21.004 --> 02:41:23.206
UP PROGRAMS SO THIS IS NOT IN

02:41:23.273 --> 02:41:26.777
PLACE OF THE CAL WORKS ANY I. T.

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.111
C. EXPANSIONS THAT THE

02:41:28.178 --> 02:41:29.980

02:41:30.047 --> 02:41:31.415
THIS LEGISLATURE -- HAS

02:41:31.481 --> 02:41:35.385
SUPPORTED AND IS CONTINUING.

02:41:35.452 --> 02:41:37.587
TO THE THOSE ARE ALL UNNECESSARY

02:41:37.654 --> 02:41:39.122
AND WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:41.758
FROM -- THE CHILD POVERTY TASK

02:41:41.825 --> 02:41:43.760
FORCE THESE THINGS HAVE TO WORK

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:46.063
TOGETHER SO THIS IS NOT IN PLACE

02:41:46.129 --> 02:41:48.598
OF OF THOSE MEASURES NOR ARE

02:41:48.665 --> 02:41:53.537
THEY IN PLACE OF THIS. THIRTY

02:41:53.603 --> 02:41:56.106
THREE ONLY 333%.

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:57.674
OF THOSE PEOPLE IN DEEP POVERTY

02:41:57.741 --> 02:41:59.142
IN THE STATE.

02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:01.344
ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:04.347
THE I. T. C. AND ONLY 20% OF

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:06.550
THOSE IN THE POVERTY ARE ABLE TO

02:42:06.616 --> 02:42:08.218
TAKE EGGS TAKE ADVANTAGE.

02:42:08.285 --> 02:42:09.920
OF CAL WORKS.

02:42:09.986 --> 02:42:13.056
SO JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT THE

02:42:13.123 --> 02:42:16.993
AVERAGE -- MOUNT NECESSARY TO

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.929
MOVE THE FAMILY AND IS IN DEEP

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:21.631
POVERTY JUST IN THE POVERTY OUT

02:42:21.698 --> 02:42:25.068
OF DEEP POVERTY IS ABOUT FORTY

02:42:25.135 --> 02:42:26.403
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:42:26.470 --> 02:42:27.838
SO THE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:29.473
PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:32.109
YEAR ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BUT

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:35.078
THEY ARE -- FOCUSED ON SHALLOW

02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:37.881

SO.

02:42:43.186 --> 02:42:44.788
JUST TO PUT THIS IN A IN A

02:42:44.855 --> 02:42:47.057
CONTEXT -- BECAUSE I THINK

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:49.526
THERE'S A A A TENDENCY AND

02:42:49.593 --> 02:42:50.827
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THAT ARE NEW

02:42:50.894 --> 02:42:52.929

WAS DEVELOPED BY THE BY THE

02:42:54.631 --> 02:42:56.166

BY THE BUDGET CENTER.

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:04.274
AS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY.

02:43:04.341 --> 02:43:07.110
OF ACTUALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER

02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:09.412
OF CHILDREN IN DEEP POVERTY IN

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:10.447
THE STATE.

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:11.781
AND THERE'S A TENDENCY WITH

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:13.683
PROGRAMS TO SAY WILL YOU KNOW

02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:14.851
LET'S STUDY IT FURTHER.

02:43:14.918 --> 02:43:16.887
LET'S WAIT ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO

02:43:16.953 --> 02:43:20.290
LET'S LET'S -- FIGURE OUT IF

THERE'S ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO DO

02:43:22.325 --> 02:43:23.393
IT TO LET LET'S FIGURE OUT ALL

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:25.195
THE DETAILS ON THE PROBLEM WITH

02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:26.062
THAT IS.

02:43:26.129 --> 02:43:30.033
IF THERE'S A BRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.268
THERE'S NOT EARTHQUAKE SAFE.

02:43:31.334 --> 02:43:32.435
WE FIX IT.

02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:33.770
AND IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES IF

02:43:33.837 --> 02:43:35.172
THERE'S A BIG HOLE IN THE ROOF

02:43:35.238 --> 02:43:36.640
OF OUR HOUSE.

02:43:36.706 --> 02:43:38.141

02:44:04.334 --> 02:44:05.869
ANOTHER YEAR.

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:07.470
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

02:44:07.537 --> 02:44:09.206
THE ABILITY.

02:44:09.272 --> 02:44:11.508
AS A STATE TO ADDRESS AND

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:14.644
LITERALLY IN DEEP POVERTY IN

02:44:14.711 --> 02:44:15.912
FOUR YEARS AND I THINK IF WE

02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:18.348
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT.

02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:20.116
WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO DO IT --

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:22.118
SO I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS

02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:23.787
MEASURE WHEN IT AT THE

02:44:23.853 --> 02:44:25.589

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:39.302
THAT SUBCOMMITTEE THIS PROPOSAL

02:44:39.369 --> 02:44:41.304

WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW

02:44:45.976 --> 02:44:49.079
AND POVERTY -- I WANT TO JUST

02:44:49.145 --> 02:44:52.749
REMIND YOU WHY IT IS THAT -- WE

02:44:52.816 --> 02:44:55.185
FEEL IT IS URGENTLY -- THE

02:44:55.252 --> 02:44:56.419
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE

02:44:56.486 --> 02:44:58.088
LEGISLATURE TO END CHILDHOOD

02:44:58.154 --> 02:44:59.256
POVERTY NOT JUST THOSE CHILDREN

02:44:59.322 --> 02:45:01.157
SIR BY THE COLORS PROGRAM BUT

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:02.392
ALL CHILDREN.

02:45:02.459 --> 02:45:03.960
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CHILDREN

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:05.262
WHO LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY AND

02:45:05.328 --> 02:45:07.530
DOOR LIFE LONG?

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:10.066
CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR TIME IN

02:45:10.133 --> 02:45:11.635
DEEP POVERTY THE LONGER THEY

02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:12.636
STAY THERE.

02:45:12.702 --> 02:45:14.904
THE LONGER THE CONSEQUENCES THE

02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:16.373
DEEPER THE CONSEQUENCES.

02:45:16.439 --> 02:45:17.574
CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN DEEP

02:45:17.641 --> 02:45:19.376
POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO GROW

02:45:19.442 --> 02:45:21.111
UP BEING POOR THEMSELVES AND

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.145
RELYING ON PUBLIC BENEFIT

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:24.147
PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF THEIR

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:25.715
STANDI POVERTY.

02:45:25.782 --> 02:45:27.384
THEY HAVE SHORT TERM AND LONG

02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:30.387
TERM EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS IMPACTS.

02:45:30.453 --> 02:45:31.921
AND THAT NOT ONLY -- IMPACTS

02:45:31.988 --> 02:45:33.523
THOSE CHILDREN BUT ALSO --

02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:36.192
CHILDREN WHO ARE POOR BUT GO TO

02:45:36.259 --> 02:45:38.528
THE SAME SCHOOLS AS THEY DO --

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:40.397
BECAUSE THERE'S HIGHER NEEDS FOR

02:45:40.463 --> 02:45:41.598
THE THE CHILDREN LIVING IN THE

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.600
PROPERTY OVER THE LONG TERM IT

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:44.968
REDUCES THE STRENGTH IN THE

02:45:45.035 --> 02:45:47.103
CAPACITY OF THE FUTURE WORKFORCE.

02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:49.005
WHICH IS OF CONCERN IN

02:45:49.072 --> 02:45:50.473
CALIFORNIA.

02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:51.941
THE PARTY IS SO DANGEROUS TO

02:45:52.008 --> 02:45:53.710
CHILDREN BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:54.744
WHEN THEIR FAMILY IS INDEED

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:56.379
POVERTY AS THEY GO WITHOUT THEIR

02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:57.647
BASIC NEEDS.

02:45:57.714 --> 02:45:59.316
THIS CREATES A LEVEL OF TOXIC

02:45:59.382 --> 02:46:01.751
STRESS THE CHANGES THE BRAIN

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.119
CHEMISTRY IN THE CHILD'S BRAIN.

02:46:03.186 --> 02:46:05.422
AND IT REDUCES THEIR ABILITY

02:46:05.488 --> 02:46:07.891
FIRST AND FOREMOST TO COPE.

02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:09.092
THAT'S WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS

02:46:09.159 --> 02:46:11.261
THAT IT TAKES AWAY OR MOVES

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:14.097
THEIR CAPACITY AT TO COPE.

02:46:14.164 --> 02:46:16.166
THIS IS THE VERY SAME CAPACITY

02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:17.267
THEY WILL NEED NOT ONLY TO

02:46:17.334 --> 02:46:20.270
SURVIVE AND POVERTY BUT TO EXIT.

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:22.238
A TO ME THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST

02:46:22.305 --> 02:46:24.474
COMPELLING REASON THAT WE ARE

02:46:24.541 --> 02:46:26.443
FILE ALLOWING CHILDREN TO RESIDE

02:46:26.509 --> 02:46:27.977
IN THE POVERTY WE ARE REMOVING

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:29.312
FROM THEN THE VERY THING THEY

02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:30.347
WILL NEED.

02:46:30.413 --> 02:46:32.716
IN ORDER TO EXIT POVERTY AS

02:46:32.782 --> 02:46:35.685
YOUNG ADULTS.

02:46:35.752 --> 02:46:37.187
THERE'S ONE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:38.922
A GROWING UP ANTI POVERTY IS

02:46:38.988 --> 02:46:40.523
MORE TOXIC TO A CHILD THE NEO

02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:41.858
NATAL.

02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:43.827
EXPOSURE TO COCAINE.

02:46:43.893 --> 02:46:45.362
AND THINK ABOUT ALL THAT WE'VE

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.364
DONE IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY AND

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:49.399
IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA TO

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:52.268
ADDRESS -- ACCESS TO KNEEL EIGHT

02:46:52.335 --> 02:46:54.304
THE NEONATAL EXPOSURE TO COCAINE

02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:56.606
IF WE IF WE SIMPLY UNDERSTAND

02:46:56.673 --> 02:46:58.842
THE ITS WORST TO BE IN POVERTY.

02:46:58.908 --> 02:47:00.977
AND YOU KNOW HOW URGENT THE SAYS

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:02.445
AND FINALLY GROWING UP IN

02:47:02.512 --> 02:47:04.481
POVERTY NOT ONLY IMPAIRS.

02:47:04.547 --> 02:47:05.849
THE BODIES AND THE AND REALLY

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:07.317
THE SPIRITS OF THE SOULS OF

02:47:07.384 --> 02:47:08.985
CHILDREN EXPERIENCING THIS.

02:47:09.052 --> 02:47:10.553
AMEND THE FUTURE CAPACITY BUT

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:12.021
ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:13.123
MENTAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IN

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:15.492
THEIR FAMILY AND THIS IS BECAUSE

02:47:15.558 --> 02:47:17.494
OF BEING A PARENT AND HAVING A

02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.862
CHILD WHOSE BASIC NEEDS YOU'RE

02:47:18.928 --> 02:47:22.065
NOT ABLE. TO TO MEET --

02:47:22.132 --> 02:47:23.233
INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF

02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:24.768
MATERNAL DEPRESSION OR PARENTAL

02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:28.037
DEPRESSION.

02:47:28.104 --> 02:47:29.572
AND THAT AS WE KNOW.

02:47:29.639 --> 02:47:30.840
PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN A CHILD

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:32.142
AND AND A CHECK AND AN INFANT

02:47:32.208 --> 02:47:33.343
AND AND THEIR PARENTS.

02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:34.511
AND WAYS THAT UNDERMINES

02:47:34.577 --> 02:47:36.646
EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS THE NUMBERS

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:38.815
OF OF WORDS THAT THE CHILD --

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:41.518
KNOWS HOW MUCH HOW OFTEN THE

02:47:41.584 --> 02:47:42.352
CHILD THE SPOKEN.

02:47:42.419 --> 02:47:44.788
TO AT AT A LACK OF ACCESS TO

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:47.357
BASIC NEEDS IS THE NUMBER ONE

02:47:47.424 --> 02:47:48.725
CAUSE OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION AS

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:50.527
STUDIED AND RECENTLY REPORTED BY

02:47:50.593 --> 02:47:54.998

POVERTY AND CHILD POVERTY IN THE

02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:39.596
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:41.664
ME?

02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:43.166

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:47.770
CHANGED THE RULES THAT I CREATED

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.138
FOR THIS COMMUTING.

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:50.206
IT IS TO ME ONE OF THE MOST

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:52.442
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

02:50:52.508 --> 02:50:55.144
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUALITY

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:57.280
OF A CHILD'S LIFE IS IS

02:50:57.347 --> 02:50:59.115
EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD EXPECT

02:50:59.182 --> 02:51:00.149
FROM THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:00.617
IN THE WORLD.

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.085
AND I TAKE THAT INCREDIBLY

02:51:02.151 --> 02:51:03.219
SERIOUSLY.

02:51:03.286 --> 02:51:04.954
AND THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR IN

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:06.356
THIS COMMITTEE WE ARE LOOKING AT

02:51:06.422 --> 02:51:08.057
WHEN WE TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE

02:51:08.124 --> 02:51:09.359
GENERAL FUND IT MATTERS.

02:51:09.425 --> 02:51:10.727
AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IT

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:12.962
REALLY WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:13.863
CHILDREN IN THE STATE OF

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:15.398
CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THIS IS

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:16.966
EXPENSIVE AND I KNOW THIS IS

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:17.934
GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY.

02:51:18.001 --> 02:51:20.169
BUT THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IN

02:51:20.236 --> 02:51:21.471

02:51:21.537 --> 02:51:22.805

IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL THINGS

02:51:26.109 --> 02:51:27.010
THAT WE CAN DO FOR THE CHILDREN

02:51:27.076 --> 02:51:28.945
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:31.781
