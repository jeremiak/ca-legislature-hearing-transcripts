CONTINUATION OF THE GOOD WORK

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:20.105 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:23.041 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:26.478 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT CALIFORNIA IS

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:28.013 region:rollup2
HOME TO A PHENOMENAL SET OF

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.615 region:rollup2
SMALL BATCH ARTISAN CRAFT

00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:33.452 region:rollup2
DISTILLERS [inaudible]

00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:35.521 region:rollup2
AND UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WE

00:27:33.452 --> 00:27:37.589 region:rollup2
WERE WOEFULLY BEHIND MANY OTHER

00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.724 region:rollup2
STATES NEW YORK UTAH AND OTHERS

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:40.859 region:rollup2
COLLOREDO.

00:27:38.724 --> 00:27:43.328 region:rollup2
IN REALLY PROMOTING OUR PARTISAN

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:45.264 region:rollup2
DISTILLERS AND WHAT I FOUND KIND

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:47.466 region:rollup2
OF INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS

00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:49.768 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE DISTILLERS JUST IN

00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:51.336 region:rollup2
THE SAME ARE SORT OF CALIFORNIA

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:52.538 region:rollup2
FARM TO TABLE MOVEMENT.

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:55.908 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE CELEBRATED OUR

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:57.843 region:rollup2
WINERIES OUR --

00:27:55.908 --> 00:28:00.012 region:rollup2
OUR RESTAURANTS THAT FEATURE OUR

00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:02.114 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS MANY PER

00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:03.615 region:rollup2
CRAFT DISTILLERS USE CALIFORNIA

00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:05.117 region:rollup2
SOURCED INGREDIENTS AND THEIR

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:06.919 region:rollup2
DISTILLED PRODUCT REALLY

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:08.887 region:rollup2
FEATURES THAT.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:12.224 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:14.359 region:rollup2
IN THAT ONGOING SUPPORT IS.

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:16.528 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:18.430 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS MUST DO IT TASTING

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.365 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THEIR ABILITY TO

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.867 region:rollup2
PURCHASE AT THAT STORY THEY

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:23.435 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S RD ALLOW THEM TO

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:24.536 region:rollup2
PURCHASE THE PRODUCT AT THE

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:28.006 region:rollup2
DISTILLERY.

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:29.241 region:rollup2
BUT UP INTO TOLD TODAY USE ALSO

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:30.876 region:rollup2
MUST DO THE TASTING.

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:31.977 region:rollup2
AND AS WE KNOW SOME PEOPLE MADE

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:33.979 region:rollup2
FOR WHATEVER REASON ON THAT

00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:35.480 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO

00:28:33.979 --> 00:28:37.382 region:rollup2
A TASTING SO WE WANT TO ALLOW

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.950 region:rollup2
THEM TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.051 region:rollup2
PURCHASE PRODUCT IF THEY'RE

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.986 region:rollup2
MISSING.

00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:43.422 region:rollup2
IT ALSO INCREASES BY SMALL

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:44.523 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THE MAXIMUM VOLUME THAT

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:46.892 region:rollup2
HE CRAFT DISTILLER CAN

DISTILLER.

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:52.231 region:rollup2

FURTHER AS THE SENATOR VERY

00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:07.305 region:rollup2
ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT TO BE

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.206 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HELP THE THE WORK THAT

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.807 region:rollup2
WAS ALREADY STARTED IN

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:11.343 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING THE TYPES OF THE

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:12.978 region:rollup2
FOR LICENSE --

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:14.046 region:rollup2
OUR INDUSTRY IS CONSTANTLY

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:15.347 region:rollup2
CHANGING THERE'S A LOT OF

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:16.882 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION IS TAKING PLACE AT

00:30:15.347 --> 00:30:17.315 region:rollup2
THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL WE LIVE

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:19.151 region:rollup2
AND DIE BY WHAT OUR

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:20.185 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTORS.

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:23.288 region:rollup2
TO BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:25.023 region:rollup2
THE THE INCREASE ON ON THAT THE

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:26.425 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF GALLONS ALLOWABLE FOR

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:28.060 region:rollup2
TYPES OF THE FOUR PROVIDES.

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:30.228 region:rollup2
IS THE ABILITY FOR A CRAFT

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.931 region:rollup2
DISTILLER TO REACH A LEVEL OF

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:35.734 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SAFETY AND SURETIES --

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:37.669 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT BY THE TIME THE UP

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:39.204 region:rollup2
BY A DISTRIBUTOR THEY KNOW THEY

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.972 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE IT TO THAT PLACE --

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:42.441 region:rollup2
IT SAID IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:44.076 region:rollup2
BE VERY HELPFUL IN CREATING JOBS

00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:46.244 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:47.879 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THESE DISTILLERIES W.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:49.881 region:rollup2
YET TO BE STABLE ENTITIES --

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:51.650 region:rollup2
IT DOES PROVIDE SOME GREATER --

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:52.984 region:rollup2
GREATER LATITUDE FOR CREATIVITY

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.086 region:rollup2
BY ALLOWING THE IMPORT OF

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:55.454 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO BE ABLE TO

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:57.622 region:rollup2
BE PLANTED AT THE DISTILLERY'S

00:30:55.454 --> 00:31:00.759 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO VERY HELPFUL --

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:01.593 region:rollup2
AND THEN PROVISIONS THAT WERE.

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:03.095 region:rollup2
THERE WERE INCIDENTALLY TAKEN

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:05.464 region:rollup2
AWAY WHEN THE TYPES OF BEFORE

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
WAS CREATED THAT WOULD ALLOW --

00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:10.001 region:rollup2
CRAFT DISTILLER TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:11.703 region:rollup2
TASTINGS IN RETAIL ACCOUNTS

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:14.239 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT OTHER --

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:15.006 region:rollup2
DISTILLED SPIRITS PRODUCERS HAVE

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.274 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD BEFORE WE BECAME A

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:17.376 region:rollup2
TYPE --

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.977 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR AS WELL AS THE

00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:20.979 region:rollup2
ABILITY --

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:22.748 region:rollup2
TO TO CONTRIBUTE TO NONPROFIT

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.582 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOMETHING

00:31:22.748 --> 00:31:26.251 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN A VERY VERY

00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:27.619 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THE LAST

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.653 region:rollup2

OUR HISTORY --

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:11.596 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER

OCCURRED.

00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:20.405 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT OTHER STATES WITH

ENOUGH NOT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:49.927 region:rollup2
BUT THE ROUTE PALMER THIS IS WE

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:51.195 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:52.697 region:rollup2

00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:28.900 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS EXPERTISE NEED FOR

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:29.700 region:rollup2

POINT.

00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:43.147 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE PEOPLE

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:45.283 region:rollup2
