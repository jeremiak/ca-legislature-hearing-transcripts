TRUCKS FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE OF SET OR NON CONSTRUCTION FUNDS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS NOT INCLUDING TAX CREDITS. SO HERE WE HAVE- AND THERE'S VARIOUS NUMBERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET CLARITY TODAY ABOUT IS- BETWEEN FOURTEEN BILLION- IN FEDERAL FUNDING COMING TO CALIFORNIA- AND ON TOP OF WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING ON TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE. AND BUT WE DO EXPECT UP TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN FORMULA OF FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND TRANSPORTATION POLICIES ADDRESS A NUMBER OF ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME. THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE- UNLESS WE ADDRESS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIRTY ERROR ESPECIALLY AREAS IN REGIONS WHERE THERE ARE. A LOT MORE PEOPLE DRIVING CARS AND FREEWAYS. WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO CREATE SYSTEMS OF TRANSPORTATION THAT MOVE PEOPLE AND GOODS IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE EFFICIENT CLEANER AND ALSO HIGH WAGE JOB CREATORS- WE HAVE A GOOD HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA. OF WELL WE HAVE A- HISTORY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO MAKE BETTER ON POLICIES THAT CREATE GO TO GOOD JOBS AND PLA'S I COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS WE NEED TO GREATLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF JOBS WITH THOSE STANDARDS ESPECIALLY TO LOW INCOME AND COMMITTEES OF COLOR AND WOMEN. WHO UNFORTUNATELY TRADITIONALLY ARE THE PRIMARY WORKERS IN LOW PAID INDUSTRIES WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE GOOD MANUFACTURING SERVICE OPERATION MAINTENANCE JOBS IN- JOBS IN TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER CLIMATE PROGRAMS SO WE NEED TO CONDITION CONTRACTS AND SUBSIDIES- THAT WILL HAVE ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENTS TO CREATING THOSE GOOD JOBS.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FRANK MENACE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- OUR OFFICE IN OUR ANALYSIS HAS- ORGANIZATIONS AND ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION- FOR THE GOVERNOR'S I'M TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE I'M FIRST- IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE IT WILL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDING FROM. I HAD A J. AIM TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE FUNDED YOU STRATEGICALLY THIS COULD INCLUDE- SUPPORTING LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES WORK FEDERAL FUNDS ARE NOT A SIGNFICANT ARE ABSENT AS WELL AS HELPING THE STATE BE COMPETITIVE AND RECEIVING- DISCRETIONARY. IN AND BUT- GRANTS. KAMALA CONSIDERED. EQUITY IN THE IN RAIL PLANNING. IT EXTENDED THE LEGISLATURE PARTNER IS- SOME OF BASE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS- SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE- THAT. GRAHAM IS A COMPETITOR PROGRAM AND- A MORE COMPETITIVE ALLOCATIONS COULD BETTER ENSURE THE HIGHEST QUALITY PRODUCTS ARE FUNDED. IT ALSO RESULTED IN FUNDING APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT UNDISTRIBUTED EQUITY EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING- FOR TRANSIT RAIL PROJECTS OR EXISTING- STATE FORMULA BASED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DEDICATED FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS- SIMILAR TO HOW THERE'S A SET ASIDE FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION- WE ALSO THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED. OF THE NEW PROPOSED PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES. INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES TO INFORM FUTURE- POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS PARTICULARLY FOR THE HIGHWAYS TO BOULEVARD KIND OF PROGRAM IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS. I'M CURRENTLY IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED- THEY HAVE- NOW EVER SINCE THEY HAVE SOME IN LIMITED REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. I'M HAVING ROBUST EVALUATIONS WOULD BETTER INFORM THE LEGISLATURE ON THE SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND IN TURN WHETHER AND AT WHAT LEVEL TO CONTINUE FUNDING- THESE PROGRAMS OR MANY PROGRAMMATIC MODIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. AND THEN LASTLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE BE MINDFUL OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. I'M MISSING MY GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE- AS ANYWHERE ALLOCATION OF THIS FUNDING WILL NEED TO BE- OR SIMILAR NAMES ARE RELATED- PURPOSES. I HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER JIMENEZ. I THE WILL NOW START WITH THIS FROM THE COMMITTEE I LIKE TO JUST START OUT WITH- I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY WITH REGARDS TO THERE'S A STATE FUNDS THAT WERE PROPOSING AND THEN THERE'S OF COURSE FEDERAL FUNDING. SO TO ME THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS. WHAT REALLY HOW MUCH ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT GOES. TO THE STATE THAT THE STATE- WILL DETERMINE. WHERE AND HOW IT GETS SPENT AND THEN THERE'S OF COURSE FUNDING THAT COULD GO TO THE LOCAL- ENTITIES LOCAL AGENCIES. SO IF SOMEONE- MAYBE- MISTER QUANT OR ANYONE ELSE COULD YOU CLARIFY THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW THAT THE FIGURE OF FORTY BILLION. IN FORMULA BASED FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT SO I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY ON THAT BECAUSE I IT APPEARS- THAT THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR US SPENDING MUCH MORE MONEY ON TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE- SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT APPRECIATED. THE MANAGER TO CONFIRM THE AMOUNT IS FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS FOR GUARANTEED FORMULA FUNDING PROGRAMS- THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE GILES JEFF NOT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAO'S RANTISI ADVISER ON CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY SO YES- THAT. OUR DAILY RIGHT FORTY MILLION AND N. A PORTION BY THIRTY- FIVE FROM FOR HIGHWAY TYPE PRO ANOTHER TENDERLY FOR TRANSIT. AND PROBABLY FIVE YEARS WELL OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS AND I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW ARGUMENT FOR BUDGET PROPOSAL IS SO RIGHT NOW- WE WERE OFFERING UNDERTAKEN RESOLUTION AND WE ARE HAVING THERE'S AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE OF THE WHITE HOUSE'S POSTED IT. FOR STARTED TO DENOTE IS THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS RAREST DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS WE SEE ONE PROGRAM WHAT THE DOOR THE RESTART PROGRAM WORKS. A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS TO GO OUT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR- AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT WITH WITH THE INFUSION OF INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR THE STATE WE GET BEING WELL POSITIONED TO. TO TOOK TO LEVERAGE YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL. DISCRETIONARY GRANTS AS THEY COME OUT PROBABLY THE SECOND CYCLE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR ANZ IN EARLY NEXT YEAR FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WITH AB TRADED FOR STRUCTURE PROGRAMS LIKE THE IN FOR PROGRAM OR DO PROGRAMS ON MEGA PROJECTS. SO I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A HALTER PROJECTS TO- TO AND POTENTIAL POTENTIAL AWARDS. TO SUPPORT FEDERAL ON THE PURSUIT OF FEDERAL GRANTS PROBABLY AS EARLY AS THE SECOND CYCLE OF THESE ARE VARIOUS FEDERAL GRANTS. ARE COMING COMING OUT DISCUSSION EARLY. THANK YOU I'M BILL OVER FIVE YEARS YOU SAID THIRTY. TO HIGHWAY. THIRTY BILLION HIGHWAY HIGHWAY TYPE PROGRAMS TYPE PROBE DO NUMBER OF FEDERAL. EVERYTHING FROM IN THE FIRST TWO ZERO EMISSION BUSCA FOR STRUCTURES- IN ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN IN- AND THEN TRANSIT FORMULA GRANTS BUT THEN THERE'S ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY MONEY TO THINGS LIKE CAP- GRANT AGREEMENT AND THEN THINGS LIKE THAT FOR A FOR A FOR TRANSIT. BUT ABOUT TEN MILLION FOR TRANSIT IN ABOUT THREE MILLION HIGHWAY TYPE I WOULD TYPE UP ENFORCEMENT FORMULA. AND IS THAT- I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK AS PROP- I'M SURE WILL BE PROPOSED. THAT THIRTY BILLION HIGHWAY- REALLY A SAD AND OR CAN IT BE USED FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE WHOLE STATE BUT A SPECIALLY AND HIGHLY POPULATED WE NEED MUCH MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND AS I SAID EARLIER THERE'S THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE- THAT'S ALSO IMPACTED ON THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE BESIDES GOOD SO. COULD YOU HOW DOES THAT- FIT INTO WHAT YOU JUST SAID OF OUR POTENTIAL OUT OF THIS FORTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SEVERAL ALSO MANAGE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS A DIFFERENT SOME DIFFERENT SETS OF GUIDELINES AROUND THE MANY OF THEM ARE LEGACY PROGRAMS- THAT WORD YEAH WE'RE GONNA SEE SLIGHT AMENDMENT IN THE GUIDELINES ARE A COUPLE OF NEW. PROGRAMS ARE BEING DEVELOPED ZERO MISSION ON THE PROTECT FROM PROGRAM FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY BUT IN THE NUMBER OF THESE FEDERAL. HIGHWAY PROGRAMS THERE'S THE ABILITY TO FLEX FEDERAL MONEY FOR EXAMPLE THE SEGREGATION EDUCATION AIR QUALITY PROGRAM TO REDUCE OUR TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY CENTER A GOOD A WELL KNOWN. FOR FEDERAL DECIDE PORTION OF PROGRAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO FLEX MONEY TOWARD TOWARD JOB TRANSIT TYPE PROJECTS- I BELIEVE THIS THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY SO- WE- GET IN THESE GUIDELINES ARE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD BY THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION WILL GET THE SPECIFICS. ON YOU KNOW WHAT OUR ABILITY IS GOING TO BE TO DO FLEXING TO THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS- AND THEN BEEN THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT TRANSPORTATION IS CURRENTLY SORT OF WORKING THROUGH THIS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND KIND OF. DETERMINING HOW THEY'RE GONNA ALLOCATE MONEY MANY OF THEM SERVING SUGGESTING STATE PROGRAMS BUT AGAIN WE'LL SEE THE FINAL GUIDANCE COME OUT FOR SIX FEDERAL PROGRAMS MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO DO. WHAT THE FLEX MONEY FROM TRADITIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECTS TO TRANSIT PROJECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES. ON THE COMMITTEE SENATOR NEWMAN. A THEN CENTER. IN THANK YOU MAY. TO ENSURE I NOTED I AM THE SENATE. REPRESENTED C. TO SEE AN EX OFFICIO COOPER- IT YEAH AND I THINK IT'S WORTH NO THAT THAT THE CA. WAS YOUR CREATED AS AN INFANT AGENTS. TO PROVIDE DISTRICT. AND OF STATE FOR ADMINISTERING TRANSFER FOR PROGRAM. SO EXCESS ILEAGE X. FOR ACT OF TRANCE CLIMATE ADAPTATION. PROJECT FUNDING THE MOST OF THESE FUNDS IN FACT THE REMAINDER WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY CAL STAR AND CALTRANS- IT'S LIKE I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION TOOL FOR YOU KNOW FIRSTOF WHAT IS THE RATIONALE. FOR SHIFTING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTERING THESE FUNDS AWAY FROM THE SEA TO SEA. YEAH AND I GUESS CONVERSELY RATIONALE FOR- SPENDING THESE MY THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS AROUND EQUITY IN DISTRIBUTION- THAT IS HISTORICALLY BEEN AN AREA WHERE THE CDC HAS PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN AND MIGHT MY THIRD QUESTION I GUESS IS SHIFTING THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT CONSISTENT. WITH THE STATUTORY ROLE OF THE COMMISSION- AS IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE QUESTION AND I WILL HAVE. MY COLLEAGUE UNDERSECRETARY WAS A KIND OF RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS ALIGNED WITH- IT IS. IT XCELERATED THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING. FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND IN THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL RESOURCES- THAT FLOWS THROUGH THAT COMMISSION- AND PROMINENT THAT STATE HIGHWAY AT COUNTY THESE ARE. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN PROPOSALS AND WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO. DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDING. AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. AND SERVE OUR RESPONSE A MEDIAN OF THE RATIONALE THESE ARE ONE FINE- IN MEDICAID HISTORICALLY THAT HAS BEEN PRECISELY THE ROLE CTC IS TO ADMINISTER SIMILAR KINDS OF ONE TIME FUNDING. GEORGE NOW I GUESS NOT A MEDIA IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A BODY NEED TO CONSIDER- AND I KNOW IT WILL COME UP THROUGH BUDGET AND I'M SURE WE'LL DISCUSS IT IN. THE TRANSPORTATION AS WELL OBSERVE THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN CENTER COURTESY. I'M SURE OF YES AS PER MY EARLIER COMMENTS ON THE T. R. R. C. P. PARTICULARLY- IT AGAIN UP I WOULD BE JUST BECAUSE FOR A MINUTE AND DO SOMETHING IN A SENSE OF MORE TO SENATOR NEWMAN IN BY WAY OF BACKGROUND- I THINK WE ALL HAVE- SOME FAIRLY DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION OUR RESPECTIVE. AREAS AND WAR IN A STATE INVOLVEMENT THOUGH LIKE CENTER NEWMAN NEWMAN'S WITH CTC SO GIVE US A CALL PART OF THE CONTEXT FOR ME. RAISING THE ISSUE- HINT IN TERMS OF THAT I'M GONNA REYES IN TERMS OF- THE T. I. R. C. P. IT. IT SEEMS THAT- HAS BEEN AS GRATEFUL AS I AM FOR THE THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSAL- GRATEFUL THAT WERE EVEN IN A POSITION IN THE TO MAKE THESE OVERALL INVESTMENTS. IT IS IN AN AREA. THAT I KNOW IF I WORK FOR TO SPEAK JUST OF THE BAY AREA AND I DON'T DO THAT HOW TO THE LACK OF- SENSITIVITY TO GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY BUT THE PEOPLE. I KNOW THE BAY AREA I THINK THEY SERVE ON THE MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER THE MPO FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE TO KEY PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE- COMPETING OR OR SEEKING FUNDS YOU KNOW UNDER THIS PROGRAM- PROBABLY COULD EASILY TAKE UP THAT ENTIRE AMOUNT THEMSELVES AND US JUST IN THE SHOULD THAT THAT THAT ISN'T THE POINT I THINK THE POINT IS IT IT JUST JUMPS OUT AT ME AS AN AREA THAT. COULD UTILIZE ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION AND BILL MY SENSES MANAGER YOU'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT FIGURE WOULD NEED TO BE OF THE QUESTION GOING FROM THREE TO SIX BILLION FOR EXAMPLE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT WHAT I WHAT I THINK I KNOW JUST FROM HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON SO THE CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PLACES WITH. SIMILAR PROJECTS TO. WHAT WOULD. WITH A WE ALWAYS REFERRED TO AS AS PART TO THE SOUTH BAY OR THE TRANSBAY TERMINAL IN SAN FRANCISCO OR- OF THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT THAT COMES DOWN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE- THE THESE ARE. HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE. THAT ARE UNDER WAY BUT- TYPICALLY WILL- IN NEED OF NOT TYPICALLY BRIDGES IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING- YOU KNOW ON THE ROAD SO EIGHT WONDER HOW YOU TO THE ELOISE COM ELIAS'S COMMENTS HOW YOU. GET TO GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY WITH THAT KIND OF A NUMBER WITHOUT. SORT OF MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF THE NUMBER YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS CREATING SORT OF SUCH A SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO EACH PROJECT THAT IT'S NOT REALLY HELPING THEM TO SUSTAIN JOBS MAY NOT AS I WAS ALLUDING TO EARLIER GET US THROUGH. THE NEXT DOWNTURN- THAT SAID- THOSE ARE COMMENTS AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO HEAR RESPONSE TO THEM EIGHT I DON'T KNOW. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SO I DON'T. ASK YOU TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST YOURSELVES BY SUGGESTING YOU KNOW WHERE AND HOW TO FURTHER AUGMENT THAT BUCKET- THIS IS A TARC P. BUCKET BUT- IT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE- LOOKING AT THE COLLEAGUES MANAGER IN IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I MEAN CLEARLY. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM THERE FOR. THE PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THE THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WOULD BE COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND THEY WOULD STILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY THE SAME FORMULA REQUIREMENTS RESTRICTIONS AND SO FORTH- THAT THAT WE SEE IN THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY. IN IN IT RAISES A QUESTION FOR ME IN TERMS OF MIGHT IT NOT BE BETTER DISCUSSING. WHETHER OR NOT WE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT SINCE WE HAVE WILL TYPICALLY HAVE LATITUDE WITH ENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND HYPOTHETICALLY WE COULD BE TAKING A LIST OF PROJECTS. GOING BACK TO THE ALEJO'S COMMENTS ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IN PROBABLY OR JUST GENERAL POLITICAL CONCERNS OF PROJECTS AND JUST SAY THESE ARE AUGMENTED BY THESE DOLLARS AS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE. PRIORITY JUST LEGISLATIVE ACTION- IN IT OR YOU KNOW WE COULD WE COULD HAVE MONEY. JUST GO DIRECTLY INTO THE PROGRAM BUT BASED ON THE WAY THIS THIS BUDGET RECOMMENDATION IS LAID OUT IN IT AGAIN BE. SORT OF COMPETED FOR WITH THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I WOULD HAVE ABOUT THAT IS I THINK THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY. UNDER TI RCP IF THEY RECEIVE DOLLARS FROM THAT PROGRAM IN THE PAST IT'S A ONE AND DONE TYPE OF A PROGRAM YOU'RE NOT. CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO COME BACK YOU KNOW TO FINISH WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO TO SPEAK IN IN SEEK MONEY FROM THE PROGRAM AGAIN. SO LET ME ASK IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION AFTER MAKING ALL THOSE COMMENTS. AM I CORRECT THAT THESE DOLLARS. WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE. TO- BUT TO REAL PART IN INTERCITY RAIL PROJECTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED MONEY FROM THE PROGRAM IN THE PAST. SENATOR ARE TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW I WANTED TO KNOW THE T. R. C. G. IS A PRIMARY PROGRAM AFTER WHICH TRANSIT REALPOLITIK STEPHANIE FROM STATE RESOURCES. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A NEW ROUND OF PROJECT AWARD WITH A CALL FOR PROJECTS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY DAYS AFTER LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TAKEN. GETTING THIS POSITION WELL TO ADDRESS OF THE PERSON FEDERAL FUNDING. ALSO T. R. C. P. IS WELL SUITED FOR SELECTING PROJECTS THAT CAN COMPETE WELL FOR NEW MONEY IN THE I. J. WHICH INCLUDES A GREAT DEAL OF INTERCITY RAIL FUNDING. IN REGARDS TO YOUR- THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT IN THE J. R. C. P. PROGRAM. AT THIS POINT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO- UNDERSECRETARY WAS THE. KIND OF TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU. IN TERMS OF THE GUIDE. FOR PRODUCT OF PROJECTS UNDER THE BUDGET PROPOSAL- THE- OF THE ADDITIONAL. THROUGH A GENERAL FUND APPROACH. WE WILL BE LOOKING TO- ED TO MODIFY. THE TO FOR THE ONE. SPECIAL CYCLE. THE WE- ISSUE. AN I HAVE A CALL FOR- THEY COULD BE. PROJECTS THAT AREN'T TYPICALLY. ELIGIBLE UNDER THE BEAST- REGULAR PROGRAM AND THAT STANDARD WITH CAPTAIN TRADE AND THEN SB ONE DOLLAR. HOW CLOSE ARE YOU HAVE BEEN. THOSE THROUGH THOSE GUIDELINES. COMPLETED WAIT. BE INTO THE A SHORTLY AFTER- ENACTMENT OF FUND AND BUT- IT'S AN EGG. APPROACH ME I. THAT WE COULD PUT TOGETHER THE GUIDELINES AND ISSUE A CALL FOR PROJECTS WITHIN ABOUT SIXTY DAYS- OF THE NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING. I THINK TO BE SOME- PERHAPS MAYBE THAT'S JUST SPEAKING THROUGH THE LENS OF A LEGISLATOR TO ADD TO KNOWINGLY SEND DRAFT WOULD- PUT THE FRAMEWORK IS THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING IN IN TERMS OF NEW GUIDELINES- I RECOGNIZE THE- IS SOMETIMES DOING THAT KIND OF THING IS- FRAUGHT WITH THE ISSUES BECAUSE PEOPLE START RELYING ON. A WITH THE DRAFT GUIDELINES ARE GOING TO BE HERE WITH WITH THOSE IDEAS ARE BUT- THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS HOW DO YOU SUPPORTED AS A LEGISLATOR. WHEN YOU'VE GOT. THE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF CONCERNS THAT I JUST REYES WITHOUT REPEATING ANY OF THOSE- AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW PROJECTS IN YOUR REGION THAT ARE KEY PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW COMPETE FOR FUNDING OR SEEK FUNDING UNDER THE NEW GUIDELINES SO I JUST I JUST REYES SAID AS A- I'M NOT ASKING. YOU TO COMMIT RIGHT NOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER TO- ADVANCING THE LEGISLATURE INFORMATION ON ON. MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF THOSE GUIDELINES BUT- I JUST WANT TO TRY TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THAT WOULD HELP A LOT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF- SORT OF GOOD FAITH YOU KNOW OF. US KNOWING. HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR. WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DELIVER THROUGH THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY MY LAST QUESTION- MANAGER. OF THE ON THE- A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS IN I COULD TELL BY THE- I THINK I CAN TELL BY THE URGENCY IN YOUR IN YOUR VOICES- THE TROOPER EAGER TO. GET THIS MOVING- YOU KNOW GET THOSE GUIDELINES- GET. PROJECTS ALIGNED WITH FEDERAL INVESTMENT. BUT WHICH I THINK PROBABLY JUMPED OUT AT ALL OF US HERE ON THE COMMITTEE- AS WELL AS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AGAIN OPTED WE DON'T WANT TO MISS. WHAT WOULD BE THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT WOULD BE INTII RC P. IF WE ALL HAD OUR DRUTHERS IN TERMS OF MAXIMIZING MAXIMIZING- ALIGNMENT IN OPPORTUNITY YOUR- WITH A FEDERAL PROGRAM IS IT THREE POINT THREE BILLION OR- IS IT A HIGHER NUMBER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF AGREED TO IT TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS AND THAT THAT COULD USE- SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THE STATE PROPOSED PACKAGE- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- IS INVESTMENTS- AND- ACROSS THE STATE. AND WOULD IT BE SUFFICIENT FOR SOME OF THE EARLY FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT WERE SEEN COME OUT AND WE'RE TYPICALLY THERE CAN BE A TEN OR 20% STATE MATCH- FOR THE PROJECT AND IT WOULD STILL PROVIDE. A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THOSE ADDITIONAL. FEDERAL GRANT OPPORTUNITIES. IT A TO GIVE A GOOD BY THE WAY OF THE QUESTION I MY- IS- HE IS A WE DON'T FALL SHORT OF WHATEVER IT THE MAXIMUM MATCHES THE- BILL WILL NEED OR THAT WE COULD PUT UP I MEAN WALKING INTO IN A NUMBER. EITHER OF THE THREE BILLION IS THREE POINT THREE BILLION IS- IF EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS DIMINISHING RETURNS BECAUSE WE CAN'T MATCH IT. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY. SOMEBODY SHOULD SAY THAT BUT IF WE'RE NOT SURE THE I GUESS THE PERIL IS OF COURSE THE WE SETTLE ON THREE POINT. THREE BILLION IN THIS PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE- AS ADMINISTRATION AS A LEGISLATURE AND THEN. IN THE FALL SHORT OF. OF TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF- OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL MATCH SO AGAIN I'M NOT I THINK YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION. FROM YOUR STANDPOINT BUT I WANTED TO. JUST GET ON THE RECORD WHAT MY CONCERN IS ABOUT THAT- IN EIGHT AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES- HERO WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS INVESTMENT COMING ALONG. HERE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE- PARTICULAR IN TERMS THESE RAIL PROJECTS THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO A SITUATION- THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID. YOU KNOW WHERE PROJECTS HE HIGH- THERE'S A I LOVE I LOVE THE TITLE THAT IT OF THE FIX IT FIRST PROGRAM WE USE THAT AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN THE BAY AREA IN TERMS OF TAKE CARE OF WHAT YOU HAVE FIRST- I THINK THE NEXT HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ME IS YOU KNOW FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED. IN I THINK THAT'S WHERE MY SENTIMENTS COMING FROM MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE. POSTER CHILD PROJECTS- OUR HEROES SORT OF THE REAL THE REAL PROJECT TO KNOW WHERE BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE REST OF THE WAY. SO THANK YOU AGAIN MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR- NOW THIS AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO- ISSUE SIX I WANT TO CLARIFY. THE AMOUNTS HERE- THIS IS FOR THE FIVE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THERE WAS FROM LAST YEAR SINCE WE DIDN'T APPROVE LAST YEAR'S. ALL WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH THE- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED LAST YEAR. IS THIS HOW DOES THIS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE DIDN'T DO LAST YEAR. WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR THIS YEAR- THAT'S ONE QUICK QUESTION HOPEFULLY THERE'S A SHORT ANSWER- AND TO I GUESS IS IF A SERVER CORTEZ THE WEEK THE QUESTIONS ARE ASKING ABOUT GUIDELINES WAS OUT ABOUT. THE WAY TO PRIORITIZE THAT WAS NOT THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE OF MY QUESTION IS HOW WILL THE ADMINISTRATION- PRIORITIZE- PROJECTS WITH THESE RESOURCES WITHOUT. GETTING OUR ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WELL I HEARD. A RESPONSE THAT THE GUIDELINES TO ANSWER QUESTION TO ME THAT THE GUIDELINES WILL BE CHANGING TO ALLOW GREATER LATITUDE THAN WHAT. WOULD BE ALLOWED TODAY UNDER TRC P. BUT WHAT I WAS RAISING IS WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE THOSE BECAUSE- IT WOULD BE ONE TO PUT THE GUIDELINE INTO A FOR. AFTER THE FUNDING IS APPROVED. BUT WHICH KIND OF PUTS US. OPERATING A LITTLE BLIND SO TO SPEAK THAT WE VOTE AND THEN WE FIND OUT IF OUR PROJECTS ARE ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE OR NOT HI THAT'S WHAT I HEARD BUT I'D- OKAY I DON'T KNOW. IF I SAID THAT CORRECTLY IN ANY TYPE OF THE SAME QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING THEM SENATOR. SO- AT THE QUESTION OF PRIORITIZING AND ALSO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR'S IT TOGETHER IT'S A TWO SEPARATE COULD YOU CLARIFY THAT. THE QUESTION MANAGER. FOR THIS QUESTION I'D LIKE TO REQUEST- BERMAN FINANCED TO WIN STOCKWELL'S FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY. ABOUT WHAT EXISTS OF LAST YEAR- THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS A BILLION DOLLARS MORE ON THE TRANSIT SIDE THAN THAN WHAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL- WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR THE- FOR THE- ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNITY PROJECTS- OVER ABOVE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAD THAT WE HAD- PROPOSED LAST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE INCLUDED THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- I CLIMATE ADAPTATION THAT WAS A ARE ON LEGISLATIVE I REQUEST FROM LAST YEAR SO WE'VE TAKEN B. THREE BILLION DLLARS AND THEN GENERAL FUND PROPOSALS THAT WERE- SORT OF HELD OVER FROM LAST YEAR AND THEN WE'VE ADDED TO THAT- BUT JUST FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL REQUESTED FUNDS. OKAY OKAY- END UP THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IS THAT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION A PRIORITIZING. MADAM CHAIR THE GUIDELINES WOULD BE.

TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE RESUMED BY TWO TWENTY TO TWENTY. BUT FLEXIBILITY IS DELAYED YOU JUST SHOULD ECONOMIC WERE IT. IS POLL WOULD DECREASE TAX BY.

ON THIS SIDE AND HI. REPRESENTED IN COUNTY IS FIND AVAILABLE TO RESPOND ANY QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE TO COMMON. THIS IS STEVE THE FINANCE- JUST WANT TO ADD THE- YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARMS. THE STATE DOES HAVE A WHOLE LOTTA LOVE IT CAN PULL TO IMPACT- GAS PRICES SO- WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS AS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS WHERE WE ACTUALLY- DO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO- THAT DIRECTLY THERE ARE. IN FACT THE FIRST BOX. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ARISE. OKAY OF THANK YOU- ANYONE FROM THE L. A. O. OFFICE. YES SIR CHRISTINE WITH THE L. A. L. THE GENDER IT COVERS OUR ANALYSIS IN DETAIL SO I'LL JUST SUM IT UP BRIEFLY. AS A ROUGH GUIDE. THANK LINE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I'M SORRY MR ENDS AT THIS CHRISTINE STATE FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR IT CAN EFFECTIVELY. L. ONCE AND IN INTACT REYES SEVEN. HOLD ON MR CHRISTINE HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND IS NUMBERS AND MINE'S A LITTLE RESTAURANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE HELLO IS SLOW BUT NOW ONE SEARCHING HELLO HELLO I'M SORRY YOU'RE BREAKING IN AND OUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW YOU MAY BE IF YOU TURN OFF THE VIDEO YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. JUICE. OKAY YOU WANT TO START AGAIN THANK YOU SURE SURE I'LL GIVE IT A TRY- MICHELLE START FROM THE BEGINNING YES. OKAY THANKS% CHRISTINE WITH THE L. A. L. E. A IN DETAIL SO I WILL JUST. SUMMIT UP BRIEFLY AS A ROUGH GUIDELINE FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUEL TAX REVENUE THAT THE STATE FORGOES AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR IT CAN EFFECTIVELY BY A ONE CENT PER GALLON REDUCTION IN GASOLINE TAX RATES. AND A SEVEN TENTHS OF A CENT PER GALLON REDUCTION IN DIESEL TAX RATES SO- FOR WITH THOSE NUMBERS IN MIND THE KEY QUESTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS WHAT BALANCE TO STRIKE BETWEEN REDUCING FUEL EXPENSES AND FUNDING STATE HIGHWAY. PROJECTS. OKAY THANK YOU THAT SUMS IT UP PRETTY SUCCINCTLY- CENTER NEWMAN AND THEN CENTER CORTESE I'M GOOD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE- THIS IS A PAUSE AND NOT A PERMANENT ABATEMENT SO I GUESS MY THIS IS MY QUESTION FOR MR WELLS I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HEAR PLENTY ABOUT THIS IN PUBLIC COMMENT- IT'S ONE THING TO REDUCE BY AS THE L. A. O. POINTS OUT THE FUEL COSTS BY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTED THAT WE'RE GONNA TRUE THIS SHOP- IN IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR AS PART OF THE NORMAL PROCESS SO WHAT'S THE RATIONALE HERE- PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT. SB ONE WHICH WAS IN A VERY PAINSTAKINGLY. PASS DELIVER THE STRUCTURE. EVEN IN ITS BEST WON'T ADDRESS YOU KNOW THE THIRD THE TOLD OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AGAIN I THINK THAT THE RATIONALE OAKS I'M SORRY SEE BOTH THE PART IN A FINANCE. THE RATIONALE IS THAT- YOU KNOW IN IT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO HAVE- IT TO TRY TO IMPACT THE PRICE OF GAS IN- IT AS BEST AS THEY CAN. AND THIS WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS IT IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR- YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WOULD- WE ARE PROPOSING THAT IT COULD BE TRUE IT UP. IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEAR SO THIS IS ONLY A ONE YEAR- ONE YOUR IMPACT. BUT BUT YEAH THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE ANY DIRECT IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF GASOLINE. AND AGAIN I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT'S SORT OF. INTERNAL CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY THAT THEY MOST CONSUMERS PROBABLY WON'T SEE THE BENEFITS THEY WOULD CERTAINLY FEEL THE PAIN- IN IN TWO YEARS- AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS WORTHY OF. SOME SECOND THOUGHT. THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER COURTESY. THE THIRTY WILL CHAIR. MAYBE THE OLEO CAN HELP ME IN TERMS OF- CLARIFYING HOW. WE HAVE ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT RETAIL GASOLINE PRICES TO THE CONSUMER. I'M SORRY M. MR- CHRISTINE I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU NEED TO BE ON CAMERA WHEN YOU SPEAK SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A GOOD CONNECTION THIS TIME THANK YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR SORRY ABOUT THAT I SENATOR CORTESE THERE IS NO THERE IS NO GUARANTEE AND STRUCTURING- S. YES STATUTES TO TRY TO ENSURE A GUARANTEE IN THAT REGARD AS FAR AS THAT YOU CONSUMER IMPACT WOULD BE PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL- BUT OUR ANALYSIS DID CONCLUDE THAT- THIS SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF. OF THE- TAX REDUCTION LIKELY WOULD BE PASSED THROUGH TO RETAIL PRICES ARE BASED ON- SORT OF OUR REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF PAST- SHE'LL TEXT CHANGES IT WAS NOT PASSED THROUGH. RECEIVES THE BENEFIT OF. WELL THEN THEM BE- BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKERS INVOLVED IN THE- FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN. REYES WHO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY YOU WILL. IS SENSUALLY RECOUP THE BENEFIT OF ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T END UP AT THE RETAIL PUMP IS ANOTHER WOULD HE SAID. YES OKAY. IN HIS. GIVEN GIVEN THAT WE HAVE NO PRACTICAL WAY TO CONTROL RETAIL PUMP PRICES EVEN FROM. DISPENSER TO DISPENSER STATION TO STATION- ISN'T THERE SOME CURL CLEAR THAT. IF YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT WHERE THE MAJORITY OF IT GOES. THAT THE BACKLASH ON THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT WE JUST CUT A DEAL WITH A POSSIBLE INDUSTRY TO THERE SOME POTENTIAL BACKLASH HERE THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC SAYS MY GAS PRICES WENT UP. OVER THE PAST YEAR NOT DOWN. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR ASKED CERTAINLY- THERE'S UNCERTAINTY IN THE IN THE OUTCOME MOST MOST STAFF POLICY ACTIONS AND SENATE IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT SAD BUSINESSES AND MANY IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY WOULD BENEFIT TO SOME CERTAIN EXTENT FURNACE- BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CONSUMERS WOULD DERIVE. MOST OF THE BENEFITS I RESPECT THEM YOUR PROJECTION ON THAT I DON'T MEAN TO CELICA DON'T AND I TOOK- JUST ENOUGH ECONOMICS AS AN UNDERGRAD IN SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN BUSINESS INCLUDING. A ONE POINT IN MY LIFE POSTING GASOLINE PRICES. AT A SERVICE STATION SO I KNOW. A HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CONTROL IT BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE YOU'RE PUTTING OUT THERE IS THAT IF YOU LOWER THE WHOLESALE COST ESSENTIALLY THROUGH THIS MEASURE IT SHOULD SHOW UP ON THE RETAIL SIDE ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL I JUST DON'T HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF ASSURANCE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY SO. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION. YEAH I FIGURED WE COULD CALL ON MISTER WELLS TO. ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE- MISTER WELLS YOU DO SAY THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO HAVE AN- IMPACT ON GAS PRICES AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON PRICES AT THE PUMP. IF WE DON'T HAVE. A WAY TO CONTROL WHERE THAT REDUCTION IN TAXES WOULD GO. UP AND IT'S JUST OUR- TOM PREDICTION RIGHT THE- ESTIMATE IT WOULD GO TO THE TO THE- THE CONSUMER- WHY WOULD WE- TAKE THAT- TAKE THAT RISK HOW IS IT THAT WE COULD SAY IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO IMPACT THE PRICE AT THE PUMP ONE QUESTION SECOND IS. IF IT IMPACTS IMPACTS THE PRICE AT THE PUMP PUTS IT WHAT AMOUNT WILL THE AVERAGE CONSUMER SAVE PER YEAR. SO THAT WE COULD THEN A MATCH THAT- COMPARE THAT TO THE LOSS OF FIVE HUNDRED OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND AGAIN ALL I CAN SAY WELL FIRST LOG SAID THERE'S- ON ON AVERAGE WE DO ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION GALLONS OF GASOLINE- CONSUME PER YEAR SO- EVERY EACH ANY CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF GAS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- IN GASOLINE TAX REVENUE. SO THE IMPACT OF NOT INCREASING- THE PRICE. BY THREE CENTS A GALLON SPOCK'S NOT WE WHAT ARE THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE WOULD BE ABOUT YOU KNOW FORTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GASOLINE AND THEN A SIMILAR TYPE OF WORK- SIMILAR TYPE. OF CONSUMPTION ALGORITHM FOR DIESEL. WHICH IS ABOUT THREE BILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL PER YEAR. SO ALL IN ALL THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO THE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WITH FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY. IN REVENUE THAT GOES ON CASH. I'M SURE. YOU KNOW WE ARE RELYING ON THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLE THAT THE PRICE IS BASED ON- THE COLLECTION OF IMPORTS AND THAT THIS REDUCTION IN THAT INPUT WITHIN RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN THE PRICE- THAT THE PRODUCT IT SOLD FOR- LIKE- OUR CALL WE GET THE L. A. O. SAID IT WOULD BE- DIFFICULT AND BURDENSOME TO STATUTORILY DETERMINED- THE WAY TO. GUARANTEE THAT BOTTOM OUT THIS PRICE THIS PASSED ON- PASSED ONTO THE CONSUMER BUT HISTORICALLY- CHANGES IN AND- IF YOU'LL TAXES HAVE. RESULTED IN COMMENSURATE CHANGE- TO THE PRICE AT THE PUMP SO WERE. GOING BY THE HISTORICAL NORM. OKAY YOU HAVE A LOT OF FAITH THAT THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO SEE THE BENEFIT OF THAT A TAX REDUCTION- THIRTY MORE. QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES NO OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER WELLS AND OTHERS FREESHEET- WE'RE MOVING ON NOW TO ISSUE SEVEN WHICH IS THE SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE ND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE OF SOMEONE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. OR THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU BETTER CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT HIS PROPOSAL. HELLO SOME SOME OF THEM ARE CARGO FOURTEEN. ARE TOO LARGE FOR LEN LONG BEACH RIGHT THERE FIVE OR OF ALL THE IN THE STATES APPROXIMATELY 4% OF US IMPORTS AND 25% OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS TO THE SAN PEDRO BAY. PORTS ARE EXPERIENCING MAJOR DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES SUCH AS CONTAINER OVERCROWDING IMPORT TERMINALS EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES AND HISTORIC BACKLOG OF CARGO VESSELS IN ADDITION TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE FACED UNCERTAINTY INCLUDING A LACK OF DETAIL CAR OVER DINNER TICKET SCHEDULES. SOLEIL'S CANCELLATIONS AND I'M CLEAR DELIVERY DESTINATIONS RAILROAD OPERATORS HAVE ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY A CERTAIN CARGO INFORMATION DETAILS. THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS ARE HINDERING THIS MOVEMENT INCREASING COSTS FOR CONSUMER AND BUSINESSES I DON'T NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENTS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO LEVERAGE AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT JOBS AFTER SUPPORT CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN PORTAL FOR STRUCTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE RESIDENT JOBS ACT MAKES SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR PORTS AND WATERWAYS AND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE. AVAILABLE FOR FREE RAIL. THE REQUESTED ONE TIME JENNA FUND INVESTS OF ONE TWO BILL DOLLARS TO LEVERAGE OUT FUND TO UPGRADE OUR SUPPLIES INTEREST. TO SUPPORT OF FISH SYSTEM. AND RESILIENT MOVEMENTS COMMUNITY. MOORE SAYS. THE REQUESTED FUNDING BE USED TO HIGH PRIORITY FOR PROJECTS THAT INCREASES MOVEMENT CAPACITY ON RAILROADWASTE CERTAIN PORTION IMPORTANT MINERALS INCLUDING RAILYARD EXPANSIONS NEW BRIDGES AND ZERO EMISSION MODERNIZATION PROJECTS. FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED BY THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WITH 70% OF THE FUNDING GOING TO INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUPPORTING THIS MOVEMENT RELATED TO THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH. 30% OTHER HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS SUPPORTING PORTION GOODS MOVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE REST OF THE STATE INCLUDING INLAND PORTS. WE BELIEVE THIS ALLEGATION CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE REFLECTED ON THE NATURE OF THE LA AND LONG BEACH PORTS. AND STATEWIDE ITS MOVEMENT. GEN AGENCY WILL WORK WITH STATE. DEVELOP GUIDE FOR LIKE. WELL THE GUY ARE NOT YET DEVELOPED. WE INTEND TO PRIOR IN FOR. PROJECTS THAT ALIGN THE GOOD WHAT THE GOALS ARE. IN MINUTE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN TRANSFER TO FOR. CALIFORNIA MOBILITY. INCLUDING GREEN AND WE GREENHOUSE GAS AND TO PROMOTING SOCIAL EQUITY AND ENHANCE SAFETY. UNPLEASANT OVERVIEW SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE IMPORTS FOR STRUCTURE. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ALSO HAPPY ANSWER ANY BY YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY JUST QUANTIFY. WE WILL NOW ANYWAY FROM FIVE COULD LIKE TO. ATTENTION POLITICS SIGN MY BANK COASTLINE FROM TRANSPORTATION A- THANK YOU- AND A FROM THE L. A. O. IN MORNING CHAIR AND JUST EUNICE THE LEDGES AND OFFICE. AND SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND ASSESSING THE PROPOSAL OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER- SEVERAL ISSUES AND POTENTIALLY MODIFY THE PROPOSAL SO THAT BEST MEETS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- SO FIRST THE LEGISLATURE ME ONCE IS JUST CONSIDERED THE ROLE OF THE STATE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INCREASE IN STATE FUNDING FOR GOODS MOVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER THE STATE'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING AND MAINTAINING THESE TYPES OF ANSWER STRUCTURE- ESPECIALLY JUST GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES INVOLVED INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR AUTHORITIES. AND FREIGHT RAILROAD COMPANIES. AND NEXT A LEGISLATURE ME ONE TO CONSIDER WHAT THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE FUNDING SHOULD BE. I'M IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THAT'S MOVING CAPACITY THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO MEET SEVERAL OTHER GOALS AND ACCORDING TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. INCLUDING REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AND PROMOTING TRANSPORTATION EQUITY. AND THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THESE VEHICLES REFLECTED SURPRISED ALREADY- OR IF ANY ADDITIONAL CALLS NEED TO BE ADDED. AND GIVEN THAT- LIMITED. BERMAN TEACHING DETAILS AND THE INVESTORS PROVIDED IF ANY LEGISLATIVE- GUIDANCE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED BEST. SCHOOLS AND IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE TIME FRAME OF THE PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSAL MAINLY ADDRESSES LONG TERM CAPACITY ISSUES AT PORTS. I'M TO ADDRESS SHORTER TERM ISSUES RELATED TO PORT CONGESTION- AND- OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE STATE ACTION IS NEEDED KIND OF IN THE SHORT OR LONG TERM AND- MODIFY THE PROPOSAL ACCORDINGLY. AND LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT THE PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH M. OR THE PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH TO PROTEST ENDING WILL BE ALLOCATED. TO THE FUNDING IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED TO BE ALLOCATED DURING NEW PROGRAM UNDER CAL STAT. BY OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS DO YOU FIND SIMILAR PROJECTS AND COULD BE USED ALLOCATE THE PURPOSE FUNDING FOR PORT RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND TRADE OFFS OF- PROVIDING FUNDING FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE OF PROVIDING FUNDING DURING EXISTING PROGRAM MIGHT LEAD TO FASTER IMPLEMENTATION EVEN S. EXISTING GUIDELINES WILL HAVE TO BE MODIFIED. ALTERNATIVELY A NEW PROGRAM MIGHT JUST BE NEEDED IF THE INTENDED GOALS AND TYPES OF PROJECTS PRIORITIZE DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. WITH THE EXISTING PROGRAM. THANKS THE LEGISLATURE MAIL WANT TO BECAUSE THE- DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING AS PROPOSED 70% OF THE FUNDING IS DEDICATED TO THE PROJECTS OF. IN AT THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH BECAUSE- THE MAJORITY OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT OCCURS IN THIS REGION- COVER THEM LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF PORT INFRASTRUCTURE. STATEWIDE TO ENSURE THAT NEEDS OF SMALLER INLAND PORTS ARE MET WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER REQUESTING CAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RATIONALE BEHIND THE PROPOSED FUNDING SPLIT. AND PARTICULARLY HOW IT ALIGNS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ACROSS REGIONS. AND IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO DEFER ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL UNTIL LATER IN THE SPRING TO SEE IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. THEN ANY ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING COULD BE BETTER TARGETED TO FILL ANY FUNDING GAPS PROVIDE ANY NECESSARY STATE BATCHING FUNDS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDED INSURANCE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS. PROJECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES AT ALL COURTS STATEWIDE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I AND FINALLY LEGISLATURE ME ON CONSIDER. THE TO. ON FUNDING OUTCOMES AND ON GOING NEEDS OF THE GOODS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE- ANY ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES IS NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT JUST WITH REGARDS TO OF THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE COMMENTS- I DO I DO WANT TO COP A COMPLIMENT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR- TALKING AND PROPOSING- OF GOODS MOVEMENT WORKFORCE TRAINING CAMPUS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S- A GREAT STEP TO GO FORWARD WITH- BUT IT DOES RAISE IT WELL I WOULD SAY BUT IT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHAT WE CAN DO SHORT TERM- I UNDERSTAND THE DRIVER'S LICENSES. OF PROPOSAL MIGHT TRY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT- IT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT ALONE IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE SHORT TERM NEEDS THAT WE HAVE SO IF SOMEONE- COULD ADDRESS THAT PLEASE- HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE SHORT TERM ISSUES.

THANK YOU SENATOR AGAINST EVEN CHECK WITH WITH CALTRANS THIS IS A REQUEST FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR TWO YEARS- IN STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT RESOURCES TO BEGIN REPLACEMENT OF THE AGING CALTRANS FLEET INTO INSTALL ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FAST FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE TO MEET- STATE MANDATES AND REGULATIONS. THE PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF A LONGER RANGE CALTRANS PLAN TO REPLACE OUR AGING FLEET- WE WILL CONCENTRATE ON REPLACING VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM SERVICE ALREADY DUE TO COLLISIONS OR INABILITY TO REPAIR EXISTING VEHICLES. BOB THOSE VEHICLES ARE IN THE WORST CONDITION THAT ARE THE WORST POLLUTERS- DOES WILL BE REMOVED OFF THE ROAD FIRST AND REPLACED WITH. THE BEST TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE PLAN OVER THESE FIRST TWO YEARS- AND THEN WE WILL SUBMIT FUTURE PROPOSAL- AS WE LEARNED FROM THIS FIRST CYCLE THIS FIRST TWO YEARS WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS A LOT ON BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PUT INTO PLACE- ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS OUR FACILITIES. THIS IS GONNA HELP US TO MEET MANDATES IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO LETTER FIRE SLEET. IS THERE ARE SOME TYPES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE RELIABLY ON THE MARKET THOSE ARE THE REALLY HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THAT CALTRANS USES FOR OUR MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION THOSE ARE NOT YET SEEING ARE AVAILABLE FOR ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION SO WE WOULD BE F. PURCHASING THE VERY BEST DIESEL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN- AND REALLY REPLACING SOME OF THE OLDEST VEHICLES OUR FLEET THAT ARE. FRANKLY GROSS POLLUTERS- THE- A REFRESH AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE FOCUSING ON THESE FIRST YEARS. OKAY FINANCE IN THE COMMENTS. JAMES OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST CONCUR THEIR PROPOSAL AND ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU AND THE L. A. O. THANK YOU MANAGE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE NO COMMENT TO CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SINCE THE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE BOB PART OF WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING HOW YOU WOULD DECIDE. OF THE LOCATION OF THESE OF THIS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATORS SO ARE YOU I FIRST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR WEEKS- IN OTHER WORDS THIS WOULD NOT BE PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS THIS WOULD BE- FOR THE MOST PART THAT ARE MEET NEW STATIONS AND OUR EQUIPMENT SHOPS ACROSS THE STATE. AND REALLY WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON FILLING OUT THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ELECTRIC CHARGER SO THAT WHEN WE PLACED ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THOSE LOCATIONS- WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. THE VEHICLES AND THEN CHARGE THEM FOR USE. HUH OKAY- BEN WE THIS- HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU GUESSTIMATE WILL NEED TO PAY- TO REPLACE THE REST OF THE CALTRANS FLEET. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE. A SOLID ANSWER FOR YOU ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IN THIS SORT OF TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE THE FIRST TWO YEARS IS- IS ASK FOR NOW AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK LATER IS WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HOW THE INDUSTRY'S OF BALDING AND HOW THEY'RE BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THE MARKET AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT THE COST OF THE FUTURE REPLACEMENTS SO. WHILE SOME OF THE VEHICLES RECEIVING A WIDE AVAILABILITY LIKE ESPECIALLY LIGHT DUTY FLEET- WERE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THAT FAIRLY EASILY BUT IT'S REALLY- RELYING ON INDUSTRY TO SUPPLY A BEGIN TO SUPPLY SOME OF THESE- THESE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SLEEP THE HEAVY DUTY CEDAR THE MEDIUM DUTY SLEEP. SO WE'LL BE USING THIS FIRST TWO YEARS TO ASSESS THE LONG LONG TERM BE WITH WITH INFORMATION. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU IS CARE ACT THE WOMAN ON NOW TO ISSUE THIRD. I'M SORRY ON SORRY SENECA THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF THE- OKAY THE- IT APARTMENT HAS A DEPARTMENT LOOK INTO A DOES IT HAVE USE LEASING THIS OF CASH CAPITAL FOR FLEET VEHICLES IN- IF NOT. ONE SO YES WE DO DOES VEHICLES ALONG OUR- WE- TYPICALLY HAVE SPENT ALMOST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN IN LEASING VEHICLES- A LOT OF THE REASON THAT WE REQUIRE AND USE OUR MAJOR MAINTAINED AND USE OUR OWN SLEEP. THEY SAID THESE ARE VEHICLES THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BRADY FOR OPERATION IN A MOMENT'S NOTICE THIS IS- YOU KNOW AS YOU ARE AWARE CALTRANS PERFORMS- EMERGENCY SERVICES VERY OFTEN ON OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S UP AND RUNNING AT ALL TIMES WE CAN'T ALWAYS RELY ON A RENTAL FLEET TO BE AVAILABLE FOR US AT ALL TIMES WE ALSO MAINTAIN A VERY HUGE SPECIALTY SLEET SNOW BLOWERS STREET SWEEPERS. ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE WORK THAT WE DO BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS- ACTION TOWARDS LEASE. FROM FROM OTHER- I WILL- BECAUSE WE THAT. WE WOULD CONTINUE TO THE STATE. WHERE WE CAME AND WHERE THEY THE MOST COST- THE WAY TO GO. BUT WE DO MAINTAIN AND VERY SIGNATURE SIGNIFICANTLY DOUBLE WORK THOUSAND VEHICLES- AND OWNING THOSE SPEAK ALLOWS TO- ALSO EACH ALONG LIFETIME THAN WE OTHERWISE SEE WHAT A WITH LEAST. IT IS A FOLLOW UP- IN IN IT JUST WANTED ARRANGEMENTS. FROM TWO TO THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWS OF IN INTO. OF. TO FOR- YOU KNOW THE ENTOUS ALIVE OF THE VIEW- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EKING OUT- ALL YOU CAN FROM VEHICLES WERE YEP RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY LIKE EVEY THIS ISN'T ISN'T NECESSARILY A GOOD MODEL ANYMORE IT SEEMS LIKE THE PAST WERE UNIT IN EFFECT YOU WOULD WANT TO- DRAW THE DEPRECIATION PERHAPS OR JUST WILL BE USEFUL LIFE OF THE VEHICLES ON AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD IT SEEMS NO- IT IN GIVEN GIVEN WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST POINTING OUT. IS THAT THE SOME OF THE FLEET. NEEDS AREN'T AVAILABLE- ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE YET- IN AND OF COURSE THAT'S SEEMS TO BE RAPIDLY CHANGING SO- I WANT TO ENCOURAGE. IRAN KERR SAID APARTMENT TO LOOK AT FLEET LEASING AS AS AN OPTION AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS FROM AGAIN FROM PURSUING IT TO SOME DEGREE. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THAT. YOU KNOW MAINTENANCE CAN STILL BE NEGOTIATED TO BE PROVIDED BY- IN THE STATE STATE EMPLOYEES AND STATE- MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO RISK DOWNTIME IN A WORTHLESS LEASED VEHICLES. BUT AT LEAST WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT THE COUNTY SO IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I WANTED TO ENCOURAGE MAYBE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS AT LEAST AT LEAST WHERE YOU HAVE- TYPES OF VEHICLES- THAT WERE BEGINNING TO INVEST IN LIKE YOU ARE HERE. ON THE EAST SIDE HELLO LAST QUESTION. HOW DO YOU. MAYBE I CAN JUST ASK FOR INFORMATION OFFLINE INSTEAD OF. ASKING YOU TO REPORT OUT RIGHT NOW BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT EXTENT WERE MAXIMIZING THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL. VEHICLES BUT IN GENERAL IN THE FREE THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AS A- TWELVE THOUSAND VEHICLES I THINK YOU SAID. IT IS- IS ZERO A RECAP SOMEWHERE JUST SORT OF AN INVENTORY SHEET YOU COULD SHARE INDICATES OF THE FUEL TYPE- PER VEHICLE. IN THE FLEET.

BASICALLY WILL CALL THESE UAS IS FROM NOW ON- THIS IS A NEW TOOL THAT ALLOWS. THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING MARK- THESE ARE WHAT YOU MIGHT. CALL DRONES- IN THE VERNACULAR OF THESE ARE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WHAT THEY CAN DO THEM IN SOME OF YOUR AVERAGE CAMERA DRONES- THE INCORPORATION OF THE U. A. S. INTO FIELD OPERATIONS INCREASES EFFICIENCY AND. SAVINGS- I'M SORRY INSURGENCY IN. WHICH OF COURSE A MAJOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO- RUSS. MARK OTHER TYPES OF WORKS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO AND VISIT THE SITE. YEAH VISIT THE SITE ISN'T THE WORD I MET WITHOUT HAVING TO PHYSICALLY ENTER INTO A DANGEROUS SITES SUCH AS A LANDSLIDE OR OTHER TYPE OF- OF ISSUE. ON THE U. S. IS. HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFICIENCY BY THE DEPARTMENT AND BY THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. AND IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF PROJECT LEVEL SAVINGS AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. ITS USE OVER TIME. I WANT TO. SAY THAT THE SAVINGS THAT WE REALIZE ON THESE PROJECTS IS IT IS AT THE PROJECT LEVEL- SO YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SEE AN OFFSETTING B. C. PETER TOPPED WITH THE SAVINGS BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE SAVINGS IN THE- CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT COSTS. GREAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD- IS THERE A HAVE YOU FOUND ANY DOWNSIDE OR ISSUES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING YOU'RE WATCHING OUT FOR I THINK ONE OF THE- A. B. ALSO STRUGGLES THAT WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WHICH IS A LOT OF THE FAA- OVERSIGHT OF USING THESE KINDS OF DRONES THESE ARE AND ARE NOT A- CONSUMER GRADE TINY DRONE THAT YOU CAN JUST CHECK OUT THERE'S A LOT OF- THAT. WE NEED TO FOLLOW IN EFFECT THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE SETTING UP OF THIS OFFICE WILL DO IS TO ENSURE THAT WE REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH FAA REGULATIONS. OKAY OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN WHICH IS PEDESTRIAN AND- BICYCLE SAFETY. TAKE THAT ON. OKAY THIS IS THE LAST ONE I THINK FOR THE DEPARTMENT TODAY AGAINST EVEN CHECK WITH CALTRANS- THIS IS A REQUEST FOR TWELVE FULL TIME POSITIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF TWO POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE I WOULD ACCOUNT. THESE WERE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO PERMANENTLY ESTABLISH THE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLIST SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT. THE PROPOSED STAFFING WELL- PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLIST MONITORING PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT.

PACKAGE OF FUNDING. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO THE- PROPOSAL HERE IS TO BEGAN TO CONDUCT THE SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS THAT WILL REALLY HELP US TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN A PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHAT THIS WILL DO IS TO HELP US- FEED INTO EITHER THE GOVERNOR'S TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY OR REALLY ANY FUTURE- SEAT YOU PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE- THIS. APARTMENTS STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS AND PROTECTION PROGRAM. IT WILL FEED INTO THOSE AND HELP TO IN ADDRESS THESE AREAS OF CPT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T STAY YOU KNOW ISOLATED FROM WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE- YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE OF CONSTRUCTION THAT WORLD FUNDING IT'S HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY GETS INTO.

ADD ANYTHING TO A- NO THAT'S- YOU'RE SPOT ON WITH THOSE NUMBERS- WE TRIPLED IN THAT TIME FRAME AND- WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THOSE HIGH NUMBERS SO- I THINK DEFINITELY JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR THE UNIT. GREAT COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OR NOT OKAY THANK YOU COMMISSIONER OF LET'S MOVE ON TO. ISSUE EIGHTEEN WHICH IS A HIGHWAY VIOLENCE TASK FORCE. THANK YOU SENATOR THE CALIFORNIA REFERRAL REQUEST ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF JUST OVER FOUR MILLION IN FY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN FY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND AGAIN THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN FY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIMES OCCURRING ON OUR STATE HIGHWAYS. THESE VIOLENT CRIMES INCLUDE FREEWAY SHOOTINGS HOMICIDES ASSAULTS AND BATTERIES AND CRIMES INVOLVING OBJECTS THROWN OR SHOT AT BEIT CALLS. DUE TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME COMMITTED ON STATE HIGHWAYS IN RECENT YEARS THE CHP RECENTLY CREATED A HIGHWAY VIOLENCE TASK FORCE. ALTHOUGH STILL IN ITS INFANCY STAGES THE FUNDING IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE INVESTIGATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT INVESTIGATIVE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS. AND OPERATIONAL EXPENSES NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE TASK FORCE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FACILITATE CONCENTRATED ENFORCEMENT DETAILS AND UTILIZE INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS DOUBLE APPREHEND VIOLATORS AND CURB FUTURE INCIDENTS. ONE AREA SPECIFIC CONCERN PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE OUR FREEWAY SHOOTINGS THE CHP STARTED TRACKING FREEWAY SHOOTINGS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. THAT YEAR CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FREEWAY SHOOTINGS IN TWENTY TWENTY OF THE SIEGE BE INVESTIGATED THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN FREEWAY SHOOTINGS THIS REPRESENTS A 65% INCREASE OF THE YEAR BEFORE. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE INVESTIGATED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE FREEWAY SHOOTINGS WHICH NEARLY IS 96% INCREASE OVER THE BASELINE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN.SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE INVESTIGATED A THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT CONFIRMED SHOOTINGS ON OUR HIGHWAYS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ASSIST THE CHP AND REDUCING INCREASED VIOLENCE ON CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAYS BY ADDRESSING THE EMERGING NEED FOR INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS TO ASSIST IN APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTION. SB PATROLLING CONCENTRATED ENFORCEMENT IS IDENTIFIED. LOCATIONS OF CRIME INTENSITY IS A KNOWN EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURE IN PROACTIVELY PREVENTING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TWO POINT ONE MILLION IN OVERTIME FUNDING FOR CONCENTRATED ENFORCEMENT DETAILS THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE B. FIELD DIVISIONS MOST AFFECTED BY HIGHWAY VIOLENCE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE CRIME ANALYTICS SYSTEM AND A DEDICATED ANALYTICAL PERSONNEL TO COLLATE AGGREGATE AND ANALYZE CRIME DATA ALLOW US TO CLOSE THE CURRENT GAP IN STATEWIDE ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND ALLOW CHP INVESTIGATORS TO IDENTIFY REAL TIME CRIME RATES TRENDS AND PATTERNS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CONNECT CRIMES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO FIND SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SEVEN ANALYST POSITIONS TO ANALYZE CRIME DATA AND CONDUCT CRIMINAL ANALYTICS AND RESEARCH THIS PROPOSAL ALSO REQUESTS NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PROVIDE FOR TRAINING. I T. IN A QUICK COST ALTERNATELY EACH ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT THE FUTURE PLEASE WORK TOWARDS. THE REDUCTION O VIOLENT CRIMES ON CALIFORNIA'S HOURS. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE LAST WEEK SEIZE PROJECT IS FROM OUR GOLDEN GATE DIVISION ARRESTED A SUSPECT IN CONNECTION WITH A FREEWAY SHOOTING THAT OCCURRED FIVE MONTHS AGO IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THE SUSPECT WAS ARRESTED AND BOOKED. FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER SHOOTING AT AN OCCUPIED VEHICLE AND ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. FOR MOTOR TASK FORCE SUCCESS WILL BE MEASURED THROUGH STATISTICAL METRICS. CONCERNING VIOLENT CRIME INCIDENTS AS WELL AS CRIMINAL APPREHENSION AND PROSECUTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER OF FINANCE PLEASE. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AS PRESENTED BY TO SEE THREE. THANK YOU THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR THIS IS EUNICE ROAD THE L. A. L. AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS HIGHWAY VIOLENCE A PRIORITY AND ONCE YOU GET TO KEEP THE SAME OVER ALL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN WAYS TO ENSURE THE FUNDED ACTIVITIES WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE AT MEETING THEIR OBJECTIVES. SEVEN BILLION RICK RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING THE FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OPTIONS THAT RESEARCHERS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME. FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT CERTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS INSTALLATION OF CAMERAS OR LIGHTING CAN REDUCE CRIME WITHOUT REQUIRING ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE. THESE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE MORE EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES COMPARED TO FUNDING OVER TIME AS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. GIVEN THAT CHP IS EXPERIENCING VERY HIGH RATES OF SPEED CONCEIVED AS IS NOT FULLY STAFFED CURRENTLY. IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY WAIVE THE TRADE OFFS OF THE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUEST THAT SEES PSS SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVES AND PRESENT A MODIFIED PROPOSAL LATER THIS SPRING. SECOND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE SEVEN ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE TRAINING I. T. AND EQUIPMENT COSTS TO SUPPORT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. WE FIND THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD HELP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. REGARDING THE ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF HIGHWAY SHOOTINGS AND HELP INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS REGARDING THE TASK FORCE. THIRD WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED THE FUNDS SOURCE OF THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. GIVEN THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE USERS OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO USE SEVENTY EIGHT FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMENDED REQUIRING REPORTING C. ABER CLIENT REQUIRING CHP TO REPORT ON THAT NUMBER AND LOCATIONS OF HIGHWAY SHOOTINGS. HE SAYS HE TO FACTORS IN THE SHOOTINGS AS WELL AS THE OUTCOMES OF THE INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCE SAYS. THIS REPORT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE DID THE TERRORISTS DETERMINE WHETHER FUTURE AND THAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE THE TASK FORCE AFTER. THE PROPOSED FUNDING EXPIRES. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR. OR A HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COMMISSIONER OF DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED THE COMMENTS BY THE LA- OF JURIES. THREE OR FOUR YOU DON'T HAVE DOUBTS ALL OF THEM BUT TO A DEGREE YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND NETWORK OF ALL THINGS THAT THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME THERE YOU KNOW THE- THE RESEARCH AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE- THE AUDIO YOU SEE EXAMPLE OF- CAMERAS WE TOO ARE LOOKING AT THOSE OPTIONS AND THEY ARE VIABLE OPTIONS. THAT- ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE DOWN THE ROAD AS WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR JUST IN DEEPER TROUBLE HAVING THE BLACK AND WHITE A PATROL CAR AND HAVING THE UNIFORMED OFFICER ON THE BEACH AND THAT DETERS. AND DETECTS A CRIME WHAT IS HAPPENING AND QUITE HONESTLY PREVENTS A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR MAKING THOSE CHOICES SO- FOR THE NEED RIGHT NOW WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN TO GET MORE OFFICERS ON THE BEAT- WE ARE ADDRESS AND YOU KNOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME VACANCY ISSUES WITH OUR OFFICERS. AND WE'RE GONNA TALK A LITTLE BT OF THAT AND ANOTHER PROPOSAL IS COMING OUT BUT- THE OVERTIME IS A VIABLE RESOURCE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO GET THE OFFICER ON THE BEAT TO GET THAT PLANE YOU PATROL. I'M TO THE POINT OF REPORTING WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS INFORMATION ALREADY SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION REPORT. THE INFORMATION AS IT COMES AVAILABLE. I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER. QUESTION OF WHY- THE NBA. I AM NOT THE GENERAL. YEAH I COULD DEFERRED OF FINANCE ON THAT ONE BACK OKAY. THE AT THE MCLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS WAS AN ADMINISTRATION PRIORITY AND THEREFORE WE FUNDED FROM GENERAL FUND. OKAY. IT DOES COMING FROM THE- MBA DOES THAT MAKE IT LESS OF A PRIORITY I'M NOT QUITE SURE I UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. HOW DOES IT MAKE IT A LESSER A PRIORITY IF IT'S MBA. A MINUTE I'M NOT KALRA FINANCED I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MATTER OF A GREATER OR LESSER PRIORITY SO MUCH AS IT IS- WITH THE FUNDS OR IS AVAILABLE FROM THE- AND TO PUT IT ON THE BILL FROM THE GENERAL FUND. I DIDN'T EDUCATION FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE THOSE RESOURCES FOR- TO ADDRESS. THERE IS EXPERIENCING. OKAY. IT COULD BE COMMISSIONER THERE WERE A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS- WITH THE PROPOSED OF SOFTWARE TOOLS- HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE. INCLUDED IN THAT. SET OF TOOLS. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AS WELL THESE TOOLS ARE WOULD BE- IF THE IF I CAN EXPLAIN JUST A LAYMAN'S TERMS IT'S JUST REALLY A CLEARINGHOUSE OF DATA AND INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD ALREADY HAVE AVAILABLE TO US- CONDUCTING OUR INVESTIGATIONS BUT IT ALLOWS US TO. COMPARE AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND IDENTIFY TRENDS SO ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THIS WEEK WE ARE STATEWIDE AGENCY SO WE'RE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION AND SHARE LITTLE DETAILS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US IN A CASE THAT WERE INVESTIGATING GOLDEN GATE DIVISION IN THE BAY AREA. WITH A SIMILAR INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALLOW US TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS AS WE INVESTIGATE THESE CRIMES SO THE PRIVACY AND PROTECTION OF THE CITIZENS IS UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO US AND- ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE WOULD BE. BOUND BY THEIR ALREADY STATUTORY SCHEMES THAT WE FOLLOW UP WITH OTHER WITH OTHER INVESTIGATORY TOOLS. RELATED TO IT. OKAY SENATORS YES SENATE QUARTERS A- THANK YOU MANAGER I JUST WANNA SAY I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE YOUR QUESTION WAS ADEQUATELY ANSWERED REGARDING THE TO FUNDS THAT THE L. A. SUGGESTION ABOUT GOING TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT. AT A MINIMUM SOME OF IT WOULD IT WOULD COME OUT OF THE- MP AND I JUST SAY TO THE- TO THE COMMISSIONER- I MEAN THE CONCERN WITH GENERAL FUND IS GENERAL FUND COMES GENERAL FUND GOES IN THIS IS. NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO HELP ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AT SOME. POINT IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AFTER YOU GET- GET YOURSELF BUILT UP- WE DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE CASE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE MOTOR VEHICLE PHONE MIGHT BE A MORE. STABLE FUND- GOING FORWARD- QUESTION I HAVE IS REALLY. GIVE ME WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A BREAKDOWN OR MIKE CAN ASK FOR THAT IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGY AND POSITIONS I DO AGREE. THAT YOU WOULD NEED POSITIONS IN OVERTIME. EVEN IF YOU HAD TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GO THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY INTO THE- DISTANCE OF THE DETECTIVE WORK TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S ON THOSE CAMERAS BUT- I GUESS I WANNA ASK ARE THERE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRENDS JUST IN THE LOGISTICS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING I DON'T MY MIND WANTS TO TELL ME THAT. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE SHOOTING DEATHS- IN THIS. THE DISCOUNTS TASKFORCE'S IS LOOKING AT IT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE ON COMING TRAFFIC THERE WOULD LIKELY BE PEOPLE IN- PERCHED IN A- YOU KNOW ON COMING TRAFFIC POSITIONED OVER PASSES THINGS LIKE THAT I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GIVE UP. INFORMATION THAT WOULD PUT. THE STATED DISADVANTAGED INVESTIGATING THINGS BUT I'M REALLY JUST ASKING ORDERED. TO TRANSLATE THAT THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED AT THIS POINT UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT ARE THAT ARE CONSISTENT IN THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE- IT MAY MAKE SENSE ESPECIALLY. WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO EMPHASIZE WITH A CONVERSATION EARLIER. YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS- IT ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN IN A MORE SIGNIFICANT MANNER THAT TIED TO THE TRANSIT YOUR SCENE BUT I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS. DO YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF DATA. THROUGH GOOD COST QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- RECOGNITION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE MAY HAVE AVAILABLE AND HOW IT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS OR QUITE FRANKLY SOMETIMES A ENCOURAGE COME ALIVE TIVITY SO- I WILL ANSWER THAT THERE ARE DEFINITELY TRANSIT WE HAVE FOUND IN REGARDS TO LOCATION OF WHERE THESE CRIMES ARE HAPPENING AND THEN ALSO COMMON TRENDS- NGUYEN IN REGARDS TO- SOME OF THEM BEING GANG RELATED AND OTHERS- I MEAN OUT OF ROAD RAGE INCIDENTS. SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENT TRANSIT WE ARE FOUND AND- THERE ARE- LOCATIONS FOR IT SEEMS LIKE A HIGHER NUMBER OF THESE ARE HAPPENING THAT WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND SO THERE ARE DEFINITE TRENDS THAT- THAT AS FAR AS LOCATION IN THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT LEAD UP TO THE SENSOR THAT'S OCCURRING. WOODBINE I FOR ONE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO. ASSUMING THIS ITEM IS FUNDED APPROVED AND FUNDED- MANY HAVE THE ADDITIONAL A PERSONAL IN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS SAID PART OF THEIR ASSIGNMENT GOING FORWARD WOULD BE TO PUT TOGETHER A MORE ROBUST. OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ASSIST OUR EFFORTS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO. IN ORDER TO. CONSIDER THAT AT SOME POINT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATORS COULD ON TO. TO TRY TO DRAFT THAT KIND OF SUPPORT YOU KNOW IN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION FROM WHOLE CLOTH YOU KNOW IT WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO COME- FROM YOU FOLKS A MORE PROBABLY MORE VERTICALLY FROM THE TASK FORCE SO. BUT AGAIN I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE SAID TO BE PART OF WHAT THIS TEST FOR DUST TASK FORCE DOES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER- THANK YOU- EVERYONE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINETEEN WHICH IS INCREASED FUNDING FOR RECRUITMENT ADVERTISING COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU SENATOR HOW THE DEPARTMENTS REQUESTING TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT FOR THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS- FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT THE INCREASED COST OF ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS EXPAND THE SCOPE OF RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND IMPROVE DIVERSITY INCLUSIVENESS ONE ADVERTISING- THE CHP IS COMMITTED TO IDENTIFYING THE HIGHEST QUALITY CANDIDATES WITH DIVERSE LANGUAGE SKILLS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCIES. AND WHO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHIC MAKE UP HOWEVER AS WE ARE ALL AWARE RECRUITMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL HAS BEEN DECLINING ON A NATIONAL LEVEL AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CG IS NOT IMMUNE TO THIS TREND. MEANINGFUL EFFORTS TO RECRUIT HIRE AND RETAIN OFFICERS JUST CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY ADVERTISING TO THE PUBLIC IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THE CHP WITH THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO ENGAGE ADVERTISING EXPERTISE DIGITAL AND PROGRAMMATIC MARKETING AND SECONDARY ADVERTISING TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND I'M PRESIDENT IN EVER CHANGING MARKET PLACE. I SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BUILT ON SOME EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVEN'T IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SIEGE RETESTED A STATEWIDE ALL DIGITAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN WITH OUTSTANDING RESULTS IN DECEMBER IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE ONSET. OF THE CAMPAIGN THE CHP RECEIVED JUST UNDER NINE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS INCREASED INCREMENTALLY INCREMENTALLY MONTH OVER MONTH DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHICH ENDED UP WITH NEARLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED APPLICATIONS. RECEIVED IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER CHIANG TO MAY MARC ADVERTISING. HAVE FORCED THE PRICE OF DIGITAL MARKETING TO RECORD LEVELS ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION. FOR THE C. H. P. THE DIGITAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REACHED OVER THREE POINT ONE MILLION. POTENTIAL APPLICANTS AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING 80% OF THE TOTAL APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVED. THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROVEN TO BE THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. AND PROVIDE FOR THE HIGHEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THE FORM OF CANDIDATE APPLICATIONS. FINALLY THE REQUESTED BUDGET INCREASE WOULD SUPPORT BRINGING NEW OFFICERS AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL INTO THE DEPARTMENT THEREBY REDUCING THE NEED FOR OVERTIME TO MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS TO THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE CHP'S GOAL IS TO INCREASE APPLICATIONS BY AT LEAST 50% OVER THE PAST THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY AS RECENTLY MENTIONED BY COMMISSIONER RAY WE ASPIRE TO RECRUIT AND HIRE A THOUSAND NEW OFFICERS TO CLOSE OUR CURRENT VACANCY RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP US ATTAIN THAT GOAL ALLOW US TO RECRUIT A DIVERSE WORK FORCE THAT REPRESENTS OUR GREAT STATE AND CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGH PROFESSIONALISM. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. AT THE MCLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENT. THANK YOU LL'S OFFICE PLEASE. IN THIS ROW AT THE L. A. AND WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU BOB COMMISSIONER HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IT SEEMS THAT YOU BECAUSE OF THE STATEWIDE DIGITAL CAMPAIGN THAT YOU SORT OF DOUBLED IT LOOKS LIKE ALMOST ALMOST DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS- IN ACTUALLY LESS THAN A YEAR- WOULD YOU STILL HAVE CURRENTLY OF ELEVEN HUNDRED VACANT UNIFORMED POSITIONS SO HOW IS THE HOW IS THE ADVERTISING AND THE RECEIPT OF SO MANY MORE APPLICATIONS. HOW DID THAT HELP WITH THE OUTCOME OF ACTUALLY FILLING THE POSITIONS. S. A GOOD QUESTION SENATOR- YOU JUST PICKED UP. A NUMBER THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW IT IT TAKES TWENTY TWO APPLICANTS CITY TO YIELD ONE CADET IN OUR CATEGORY- SO WHAT TO FILL THE THOUSAND VACANCIES WE NEED OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND APPLICANTS TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THOUSAND AGENCIES BUT- THAT'S JUST ONE PART OF THE PROGRAM THAT. WE'RE WORKING ON THAT WE REALLY LOOKED AT IT A THREE PRONGED APPROACH WE- INCREASING EFFICIENCIES AT OUR ACADEMY TO ALLOW US TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH AN AMOUNT OF TIME. WE ARE ARE LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES THAT WE CAN CHANGE IMPROVE AND THE BACKGROUND PROCESS TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT APPLICANTS ARE IN THE BACKGROUND PROCESS AND THE THIRD PART ONCE YOU CLEAR OUT THAT BACKGROUND POOL IS TO RECRUIT AND THAT'S WHERE THIS PROPOSAL COMES AND AS JUST. INVESTING IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND GET IN AS MANY. CANDIDATES TO THE POSTS WE CAN. AND HOW IT THAT THIS GUY THE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU FEEL. BOND MAKES IT CHANCES OF. INCREASING THE RECRUITMENT RATE AND EVENTUALLY OF FILLING THE POSITIONS WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN THAT HELPS TO GET THEIR MARKETING CAMPAIGN HELPS US REACH THE PEOPLE THAT THAT WE NEED TO. AND HE GETS OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL THINGS WE'VE USED IN THE PAST WITH RADIOS AND BILLBOARDS AND DIGITAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN ALLOWS US TO.

COMMENTS CENTER COURTESY DISK I'M JUST CURIOUS- ON ON THE NEW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND I THINK THIS IS THE PRIME READING THIS WRITER HEARING IT READ IT MIGHT BE JUST- NUMBER TWO. THE SECOND BULLET POINT- IN MY NOTES- CENTER BRAWLEY BUT ARE THESE BUILDINGS BEING- SPECT OUT HIS NET ZERO BUILDINGS NOW. TELL ME IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL I'LL TAKE THE FIRST QUESTION SO SENATOR HI STEVE MARTIN DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA VEHICLES. CURRENTLY WE ARE- YOU SEEN A RENTED FACILITY IN BRAWLEY IT WAS CONVERTED OUT FROM I THINK AN AUTO PARTS STORE SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY NEEDS. THOSE THAT LEVEL OF- A CERTIFICATION- AND THE PROBABLY FACILITY WAS BUILT YOU KNOW HAS YOU HEARD FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE C. SUITE WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY ISHE SO I DON'T THINK IT FOLLOWS ANY OF THE ANY OF THE STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CARE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SO ON. BUT BUT MANY OF OUR NEW OUR OFFICES DO SO I THINK AS WE AS WE BUILDINGS OUT THERE WHETHER THEY'RE BEASTS OF THE GOLD CERTIFIED I THINK WE ARE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION FOR MANY OF OUR NEWEST OFFICES- BUT NOTHING NOT THE ONES THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY BECAUSE MANY OF MARK DATED AND ONE AS I MENTIONED WAS JUST RENT IT WAS JUST RECENTLY OPENED. IN THAT FACILITY. AND BROUGHT. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THE- THANK YOU. THE NEW NO NO MARK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON ISSUE TO ONE REMOVED LAST WEEK. ISSUE OUGHT TO TWO WHICH- OF SUPPLY CHAIN WITH THE COMMERCIAL LICENSE- MISTER SCOTT LAST ISSUE S IN RELATION TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE PROPOSAL AND ADDRESSING FUNDING- TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY TO COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES TO THE DMV HAS A REQUEST IN A PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION TO SUPPORT THE SUPPLY CHAIN INVESTMENTS IMPORT FREIGHT AND GOODS. MOVEMENT STRUCTURE. AGAIN DEANNE BECAUSE A OF MILLION TO ENHANCE COUPLE COMPOUND IT JUDICIARY BECAUSE PRECISE INSISTS. THAT'S FUNNY INCLUDES AND A HALF MILLION AND JUST YEAR TWENTY TO TWENTY AND MILLION ANNUALLY. THROUGH FIVE TWENTY SIX TO FIND THE SCENE BECAUSE TO ESTABLISH DEDICATED COMMERCIAL DRIVE TEST CENTRES. IN BOTH THE STEPS THE SCOPE AREA AND OR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BUT IN ADDITION IT'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE TIME FUNDING OF SIX NINE AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO FIND OVERTIME ON SATURDAYS FOR LICENSING REGISTRATION EXAMINERS. UNNECESSARY SPORTS STUFF WHICH WILL BE REDIRECTED OR WILL BE DIRECTED TO CDL SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES IN EXCESS OF THIRTY DAYS. IT WILL ALSO FUND OF SOCIO TRAVEL COSTS FOR STAFF AND- FOR THESE EXPENSES- OUT BUT THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS REQUEST. OKAY FROM FINANCE. ANY COMMENTS. THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF FINE- WE SUPPORT THE- COM MADE THE IN THE CHAIR I UNITS ROAD DELL'ANNO THAT WE JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE PROPOSAL BE FUNDED THROUGH THE NBA AND STATE OF THE GENERAL FUND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL AS WELL ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO PROCESSING COMMERCIAL DRIVE TESTS WHICH THE STATE COLLECTS A FEE TO SUPPORT. SECOND WE RECOMMEND ONGOING AND REQUIRING ONGOING REPORTING TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER THE INCREASED WAIT TIMES FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVE TEST WILL BE AN ONGOING OR A ONE TIME ISSUE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVER LICENSES WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO. DETERMINE WHETHER I'M GOING FUNDING FOR COMMERCIAL DRY SET TEST AND THERE'S IS NEEDED BEYOND TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL. I THANK YOU- SOMEWHAT ALONG THOSE LINES. I HAVE A QUESTION IS HOW DID YOU OR HOW OR WHAT INFORMATION CAME TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT- SOMEHOW THE DM B. WAIT TIMES OR THE BOTTLE NECK- FORGET THE MORE TRUCK DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. WHAT WHAT LED YOU TO OR ANYBODY TO THAT CONCLUSION- I STEVE GORDON. ALL STEP IN HERE AS DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA FOR MOTOR VEHICLES- SENATE I SHARE YOUR CONCERN- I THINK MORE ONE PART OF THIS ECOSYSTEM BUT A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT AS DRIVERS ARE TRAINED AT VARIOUS TRAINING SCHOOLS AND SO ON THAT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET. CERTIFIED CREDENTIAL HI COMPLETES THEIR EXAMINATION SO THEY GET ON THE ROAD I DON'T THINK WERE THE ONLY PART OF THIS ECOSYSTEM THAT IS THE BIG CHALLENGE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN STEP UP AND MAKE SURE DRIVERS ARE SORT OF WHY WE DO HAVE AN AGING POPULATION AND CALIFORNIANS CDL HOLDERS CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL DRIVER HOLDERS. ARE OLDER THAN THE POPULATION IN GENERAL AND MATTER OF FACT YOU KNOW 60% OF OUR CURRENCY HOLDERS ARE ABOVE AGE FORTY FIVE. YOU KNOW 35% OR ABOVE AGE FIFTY FIVE SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LEAVING THE FIELD SO PART OF IT IS JUST THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THE STUDIES ON SPECIALLY LONG HAUL DRIVERS. IT'S NOT A GREAT JOB AND PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE ARE TURNING OVER BUT OF COURSE THAT DRIVES THE NEED FOR NEW DRIVERS SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE FIELD SO IT'S A IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUR END OF- TRANSPORT OUR END OF THE SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT DRIVERS WHO WANT TO BE COMMERCIAL DRIVERS. CAN GET SORT OF. YEAH I AND I AM. THAT I'M DO DID WE REACH THE CA. THAT PASSED WHERE THE- IS. BECAUSE THIS IS QUITE A HUGE. INVESTMENT AND IF HE SAID. OKAY BASED ON THIS SYSTEM THAT. THIS IS THE CONCLUSION THAT OUR PEACE. IS ESSENTIAL TO GETTING MORE TRUCK DRIVERS I JUST. I HAVEN'T HEARD WHY AND WHO CAME UP WITH THIS AS WAS THE RATIONALE FOR IT OTHER THAN WE SEE A LOT ON ON YOU KNOW TV WE SEE A LOT ON THE NEWS THAT THERE'S A SUPPLY CHAIN OF PROBLEM BUT- I HAVEN'T SEEN SPECIFICALLY THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A- DRIVER'S LICENSE. I JUST THINK IT CLARIFIED YEAH YEAH I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE ARE IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ROLE IN IN RESOLVING OUR PORTION WEEKEND WE HAVE THESE DRIVERS ARE EXTREME SCHOOLS SAY. THEY'VE BEEN PAYING A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET YOU ON THE ROAD AND PLAY- YOU KNOW. PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY MORE FULLY SO I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW TAKE THEIR EXAMS AS AS THE- THESE KIND OF GENERALLY TAKE EXAM SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THEIR RESIDENTS AND BRING OUT OF LOS ANGELES- IT WAS OVER. 20% OF OUR EXAMS ARE IN THAT GREATER AREA AND IF YOU GO TO THE FURTHER EAST YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER YOU KNOW 1520% AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THAT PROPOSALS ARE TO BE NORTHERN L. A. AND ALSO IN THE BAY AREA. IT'S ANOTHER 10% IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE CONCENTRATED THERE SO WE HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE BAND AND SO I CAN'T TELL YOU IS THAT DEMAND. YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GENERATED OTHER WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE DEMOGRAPHICS B. THE QUALITY OF LIFE ESPECIALLY LONG HAUL DRIVERS BECAUSE YOU TURN OVER. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE DO OUR PART I THINK DOING NOTHING AND I MEAN PRETTY MUCH FROZEN DO NOTHING HERE BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW NOT NOT COMPLETING THIS TASK FOR THE STATE AND INCOMPLETE IT CURRENTLY IN PROCESS I THINK ALSO REPRESENTING YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINED LOOKING FOR JOBS I CAN'T GET CERTIFIED IN THE STATE AND WORK. TO HELP CLEAR THE PORTS AND OTHER THINGS SO. IT'S COMPLEX AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT EXACTLY THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN KEEP THE EXISTING. PROCESS WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN. M. I'M SURE I BEEN CUT. OF THAT TO THAT YOUR CURRENT DO HAVE A HOUSE OF. TWENTY THREE TO. SITES IN THE CASE- IT ONLY FOR. REALLY TO KIND OF HANG. WHAT THE TEST WOULD. KIND OF ANCHOR. BOB WHITTEN BETWEEN THE BIG. BACK THE BASICS. IN THE ROW TEST. THAT'S A LOT OUR KIND OF IT THE FEEL OFFICE IS WELL AND SO WE HAVE. A LOT OF. SPACE TO FISHING- THE KIND OF. ON TOP STREETS IN COLD SAC- THEY WERE BE. SUB FIELD OFFICES WERE OF AB AREA. I'M REAL. ST AS- WHERE THE POP. IS PROBABLY WHAT IS. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. BUT I'LL POPULAR. ARE IN. THE MORE OF AN ISSUE SAFETY. WEBER CONDUCTING THIS. SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT ALL ARE COMPOUND. IS GOING TO BE A BILL. IN THE EVENT THAT MORE TRUCK DRIVER ARE DIDN'T FOR THE PORT TO ME. THAT WHEN WE'RE CONDUCTING A TEST OF THEIR DONE A- IF. AND- IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT. SURNAME IS. YOU SHOULD NOT SURE JUST JUST I'VE GOT A- A FRAMEWORK FOR ABOUT THE IF THE CURRENT WAY TIME- BUT MISTER GORDON THIRTY SIX AND IT WAS TO TWO DAY COUPLE YEARS AGO WHAT BUT IMPROVE THAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE INFO AND BY.
