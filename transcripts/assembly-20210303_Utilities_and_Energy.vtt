HUMIDITY ALONG WITH AN AGING

TRAGIC FIRES WITH GREAT HARM TO

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.912
FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES. AFTER

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:10.115
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES IN

SAN DIEGO THE UTILITY WAS

REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRES CAUSED

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.289
BY ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE BY

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:21.059
TEMPORARILY TURNING OFF POWER.

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:22.127
AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:24.762
ADDRESS WILDFIRE THREATS AND

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.898
UTILITIES IN TWO THOUSAND

NEED TO HAVE PS PS EVENTS

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:32.170
CONTINUE AS A TOOL. BUT IT

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.273
WASN'T A MANDATE. BUT ITS

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.774
STRATEGIC USE IS CALLED INTO

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:39.811
QUESTION. WHEN WE SEE THE HUGE

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:44.082
JOB AND USE WHICH OCCURRED IN

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.151
TWENTY TWENTY. FROM TWO

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:46.951
THOUSAND THIRTEEN WENTZ SDG AND

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:49.254
E. U. S. P. S. P. S. EVENTS FOR

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.025
THE FIRST TIME. TO TWO THOUSAND

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:54.592
NINETEEN IT WAS USED THIRTY

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:57.462
THREE TIMES. BUT IN TWENTY

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:59.764
TWENTY FOR JUST ONE YEAR WE HAD

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.366
THIRTY THREE PS PS EVENTS. WHAT

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:05.637
HAPPENS. PS PS EVENTS WERE A

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:07.872
DISASTER IN TWO THOUSAND

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:08.573
NINETEEN. CUSTOMERS WERE

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.910
CONFUSED ANGRY AND PARTICULARLY

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.279
THOSE IN P. GINNY'S TERRITORY.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.747
I THOUGHT THE UTILITIES LEARN

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:16.347
FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:20.218
EVENTS. AND WHAT NOT TO DO. THE

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:23.721
CPUC N. O. YES ARE TO BE

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:24.789
COMMENDED FOR THE GREAT WORK

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.691

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.760
TIME PROTOCOLS AND WORK WITH

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:29.994
UTILITIES TO ENSURE THAT

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:32.130
IMPACTS ARE MITIGATED AS MUCH

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:35.800
AS POSSIBLE. AN ADULT REPORTS

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.535
INDICATE SIGNIFICANT

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.269
IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME PARTS OF

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:41.172
THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN PG&amp;E

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.508
TERRITORIES HOWEVER WE WERE

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.009
ALARMED TO HEAR THAT EDISON

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.110
NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:49.180
EVENTS THEY CALLED IN TWENTY

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:50.148
TWENTY AND HAD REPEATED

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.416
FAILURES TO FOLLOW PROTOCOLS AT

00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:53.585
THE EXPENSE OF CUSTOMERS. AND

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.954
PUBLIC SAFETY. EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.922

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:09.734
IN THE MOMENT THEY DID NOT.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.135
THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.103
WHETHER THE AGENCIES HAVE

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.305
SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT TOOLS

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:16.107
WHICH CAN BE USED IN REAL TIME

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.209
IF A UTILITY IS CALLING EVENTS

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.345
UNNECESSARILY OR FAILING TO

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.780
FOLLOW PROPER NOTIFICATION

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.782
PROTOCOLS FOR CUSTOMERS. PUBLIC

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.085
SAFETY PARTNERS AND OTHER STATE

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:30.922

BEEN MORE EVIDENT. THEN NOW

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.917
THAT RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:35.687
IS THE CENTRAL TO THE SAFETY

EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:09.053
NUMBER OF POWER SHUT OFFS BY

THEIR UTILITIES. UP UNTILMID

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.659
JANUARY THE MAJOR UTILITIES

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.928
WE'RE CONTINUING TO CALL POWER

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:20.698
SHUT OFF THE EVENTS. THE CPUC

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.734
HAS BEEN DRIVEN DRIVING. THE

ANOTHER TOOL AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:37.882

ONE MILES PER HOUR- NOT ALWAYS

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:31.499

PERCENTILE MEANING THAT THEY

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.552
ONLY SEE THAT ONE SPEED 1% OF

THE TIME- AND THEN- EVEN MORE-

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.525

HUGE NEED TO NOTIFY NINETY FIVE

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:27.922
THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. OF

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:29.357
THE POTENTIAL OF PUBLIC SAFETY

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.692
POWER SHUT OFF- WE ENDED UP THE

ENERGIZING SEVENTY THREE

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:34.695
THOUSAND A LITTLE OVER THAT OF

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.330
THEIR OF THOSE CUSTOMER

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.566

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.874
WERE NOT. A DRIVE THRU FORMAT

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:49.043
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SITUATION-

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.144
THIS WAS MORE TRAFFIC THAN

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.712
WE'VE- SEEN EVEN AND NOT OF THE

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:54.515
WALK UP TYPE- COMMUNITY

RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WE HAVE

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.718
IN THE PAST- SO. HOW DO WE

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.187
ENSURE THAT WE'RE USING THIS

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:00.354

CARE WHEN MAKING THESE

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.330
DECISIONS- WE DO NOT TAKE THESE

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:11.666
DECISIONS LIGHTLY- EVEN IN THE

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.467
A LARGE EVENT IN DECEMBER. WE

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:14.936
DO ENERGIZED OVER EIGHTY

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:33.547
I WANTED TO WALK THROUGH THAT

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.682
WORST OF INTERESTED TO KIND OF

RESORT WE- USED PUBLIC SAFETY

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.265
PARTIAL OFTEN IN SIX OF THE

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:54.101
ELEVEN EVENTS- WE THE NEXT

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:56.270
LARGEST ONE FROM THE SEVENTY

WAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS-

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:00.107
THEN WE HAD TWO EVENTS THAT

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:01.242
WERE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.611

FOUR HUNDRED CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:05.546
AND THEN ONE OF AND IT WAS

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:06.714
ACTUALLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.316
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND- THOSE

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:14.055
ARE MORE ARE TYPICAL OF PS PS-

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:15.222
ADVANCING IMPACTS- SO EVEN

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.724
TELLS. OF THE TREATMENTS. WERE

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.893
WORKING OVER ONCE IN THE PAST.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.295
OUR BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:22.129
THIS BETTER SHORT TERM ACCORDED

01:33:22.196 --> 01:33:23.464
NOT EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT

INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN FACT WE

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.602
WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ONLY

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:31.539
HAVE- ONE SIGNIFICANT OF. THAT

IMPACT OUR SERVICE TERRITORY

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:34.709
NOW WITH THE VALLEY FIRE IN

SEPTEMBER- HAVING SAID ALL THIS

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.278
WE UNDERSTAND THAT PUBLIC

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.683
COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE-

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.085
WE'RE STRIVING TO MINIMIZE THAT

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.753
IMPACT SO WE'RE GOING TO.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.188

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:02.122
HAVE HEARD. MANY MANY

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.756
OBSERVATIONS FROM OUR

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:05.225
CUSTOMERS- FROM OUR-

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:07.161
STAKEHOLDERS FROM OUR PARTNERS

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:09.430
ABOUT THE NEED TO DO BETTER I

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:11.365
THINK THIS- COMMITTEE CAN HELP

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:13.967
IN THAT REGARD. BY HOLDING

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:17.738
THESE HEARINGS- HI YOU FORM FOR

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:18.872
US TO DISCUSS ANY FRAME UNDER.

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:19.907
WHERE WE'RE NOT MEETING THE

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:22.109
NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THIS

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:24.211
COMMITTEE. I DO BELIEVE THERE

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:25.646
IS A ROLE IN COLLABORATION

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:27.181
HERE- WITH ALL OF OUR

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.383
STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS INCLUDES

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.385
THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA-

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:32.786
BECAUSE MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:34.421
SEEING IS UNIQUE I JUST WANT TO

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.457
REMIND. ALL OF US THAT IT'S IN

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:37.825
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:39.893
HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.062
IN THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.831
AS EVIDENCED BY THE SIZE AND

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.866
PREVALENCE OF WILDFIRES. WE ARE

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:47.201
GAME DEALING WITH SOMETHING

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.069
THAT'S VERY NEW- IN THIS

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:50.871
CERTAINLY IN MY CAREER-THE

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.606
NOTION OF THE ENERGIZING

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:54.308
CUSTOMERS THIS IS JUST NOT HOW

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.844
WHERE. FORGIVE ME HOME WIRED I

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.779
MEAN WE LIVE TO KEEP OUR

01:41:58.846 --> 01:42:00.347
CUSTOMERS ENGAGED WE ARE

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:02.149
MANDATE MANAGED OUR PERFORMANCE

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:03.817
METRICS THAT HOLD US

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:06.019
ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOW HOW WELL

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:07.888
WE ARE KEEPING OUR CUSTOMERS

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.023
ENERGIZED. SO I THINK THIS KIND

01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:12.893
OF- OF DISCUSSION IS HELPFUL

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.027
AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:16.029
OUR COMMITMENT. TO CONTINUE TO

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:18.232
DO BETTER DO YOU USE THE S. P.

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:20.734
S. LAST TO DO IT BETTER WHEN WE

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.236
HAVE TO DO IT TO MAKE IT LESS

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:23.470
PAINFUL FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN IT

01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:25.205
HAS TO HAPPEN. AND ALSO TO BE

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:27.441
MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:33.647
IN AND HOW AND WHY WE. ARE

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:34.681
EXECUTING YES YES. AGAIN

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:36.483
APPRECIATE THE I THINK THAT IS-

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.684
IS WHAT WE RECEIVE THAT IN THE

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.119
SPIRIT OF WHICH IS GIVEN AND

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.787
WE- LOOK FORWARD TO

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:42.856
COOPERATING- AND-

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:45.025
COLLABORATING- GOING FORWARD

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:48.862
AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW THE REAL.

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.564
THRUST BEHIND THE QUESTION WAS

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:53.200
WHAT HAPPENS. AT THE END OF

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:56.003
THIS YEAR AND WE FIND THAT-

01:42:56.069 --> 01:43:00.707
THERE IS A- DEFICIENCY- AND

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:03.944
I'LL I'LL JUST- NOT NECESSARILY

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.879
FORCE YOU TO ANSWER THAT PART

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.114
OF IT AND WENT IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.249
WE SHOULD DO BUT I THINK. THE

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:13.053
IDEA OF. RECOGNIZING THAT AS

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.421
THE YEAR BECAUSE THIS YEAR GOES

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:15.789
FORWARD AND AS WE MOVE INTO THE

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:19.593
FUTURE YEARS WE DO WANT TO SEE-

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.828
NOT JUST INCREMENTAL INCREASES

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.931
IN EFFICIENCY AND- AN

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:25.532
EMPLOYMENT TATIAN OF WHAT

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:27.267
YOU'VE LAID OUT. BUT WE WANT TO

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:31.338
SEE QUICK- EFFICIENT MARKET.

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:34.107
IMPROVEMENT SO THAT WE ARE

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:35.676
GOING TO THEN LOOK TO SOME OF

01:43:35.742 --> 01:43:37.644
THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE-

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:39.613
EARLIER ON THAT WE CAN START TO

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.181
MOVE AWAY FROM. THE

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.383
INTERNALIZATION AS A TECHNIQUE

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:46.587
THAT WE ARE NOW ACTIVELY SEEING

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:48.956
RESULTS. AND THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:51.158
AND OTHER. IMPLEMENTATION

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.093
STRATEGIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.195
ARE BEING PROPERLY EXECUTED.

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:58.332
AND SO THEREFORE AS WE WANT TO

01:43:58.398 --> 01:43:58.932
BE ABLE TO HOLD ALL OF YOU TO

01:43:58.999 --> 01:44:02.903

ENERGIZING LINES BECOME

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:07.207
SOMETHING THAT. NOT ONLY DO IT

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:09.543
WHEN NECESSARY AND JUST IN

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.812
PARTICULAR INSTANCES BUT IT

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:13.814
BECOMES NOT NECESSAY AT ALL.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.616
LET ME DISCUSSES THE QUESTION

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.017
TO SEE IF YOU SEE AND THEN I'M

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.052

TO MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:46.747

DISCONNECTING THE FLOW OF

01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:20.387
ELECTRONS THROUGH THE WINDS.

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:22.889
MORE WHEN THESE MEN WILL BERATE.

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:25.158
THAT ANOTHER CHECK NOW HELLO

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:27.394
WILL IT TAKE TO DEVELOP. FOR

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.329
THEM AND WHAT SORT OF

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.898
TECHNOLOGIES ALL YOU SEE IS

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:35.268
WHAT SORT OF A TIME FRAME. IN

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:37.804
NO. WHICH YOU TELL WITH A LOT

CONDUCTED KNOWLEDGE EACH WERE

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:52.953
AT THE BILL THE ONE BREAKS IT

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.688
WE CAN SENSE THAT ENERGIZED FOR

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:57.691
HIS THE GROUND- WE DEPLOYED

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:59.960
THAT ON I BELIEVE EIGHT TO TEN

01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:01.161
CIRCUIT TO. GET THE EXACT

01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:02.529
NUMBER SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:06.866
THOUGH AND- THE- IMPEDIMENT TO

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:08.668
GOING FASTER IS THE POINT OUR

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:10.303
PRIVATE LTE NETWORKS YOU HAVE

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:11.671
TO HAVE A CERTAIN.

COMMUNICATION SPEED BETWEEN

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.774
DEVICES OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER FOR

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:17.277
THAT TO HAPPEN- WE PURCHASED

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:18.979
THE BROADBAND SPECTRUM FOR

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.847
PRIVATE LTE NETWORK LAST YEAR-

01:50:20.914 --> 01:50:22.115
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:23.650
INSTALLING THE COMMUTER

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:25.418
STATIONS THE THAT'LL COST TO DO

01:50:25.485 --> 01:50:28.188
THAT- BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:31.992
FULLY FUNCTIONAL BY TWENTY

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:32.625
TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:33.360
AND WE'VE BEEN INSTALLING THE

01:50:33.426 --> 01:50:34.961
DEVICES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:37.030
TO TALK TO IT- WITH HER BY HER

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:42.102
NEED EFFORT SO IT'S. BEING DONE

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:48.208
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT. THE

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.576
AMAZING COMPETING I CAN GO NEXT

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:53.813
THANK SO MUCH FOR QUESTION- IN

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:54.814
ADDITION TO THE OTHER FALLING

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.149
CONDUCTOR KNOWLEDGE SAID THANK

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:58.585
YOU BROKE OFF. WHICH I

01:50:58.651 --> 01:50:59.119
REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY THE

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:01.054
RAPTORS FONG AND THEIR TAKE ALL.

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:03.456
THANK IT THAT THAT HAS. AROUND

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:05.692
SINCE TO. INSTEAD OF VICTORIA

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:08.762
IN AUSTRALIA- ACTUALLY WHERE-

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.897
WE GOT INSIGHTS ON THE FOURTH

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:11.998
OF THE DAY THAT WOULD BE THE

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:13.400
BENCHMARKING BACK IN MIDDLE ONE

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:16.770
NINETEEN- SO I MENTIONED WE'VE

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.538
FIVE SOLD ON WATER CIRCUIT STOP

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:20.607
ACTING. ROUGHLY HUNDRED FIFTY

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:28.581
PLUS MILES HI AND. WE'RE

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:29.716
REALLY- EVALUATING. ALL COSTS.

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:33.486
OF UNDERMINED OF THAT ON OUR-

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:34.988
MORNING THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:36.222
PART OF. ALSO LEARN. A

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:37.490
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN TERMS OF

01:51:37.557 --> 01:51:38.792
THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.860
UPGRADES ALL YOU HAVE TO MAKE.

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.695
AND WE LOOK AT THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:44.197
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHO WITHIN

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:47.567
OUR OVERALL SYSTEM HARDENING.

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:50.203
IT'S NOT HAD A SKI- BUT BUT IT

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.838
DOES GO AFTER ONE OF THE

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.740
PRIMARY TYPES OF FALLS THAT

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:55.341
COULD RESULT IN A POTENTIALLY

01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:56.810
MISSION- WHICH IS BASED GROUND

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:59.546
BALL- NOW WITH OTHER AREA THAT

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:01.414
DAY DOES NOT REALLY AFFECT ME

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.249
THEY GAVE YAK WHOSE. OUT YOU

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:05.285
SEE TWO LINES ARE SLAPPING

01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:06.853
TOGETHER OR SOMETHING CALLED A

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.688
BASED BASEBALL. OUT WAR WHEN

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:09.756
YOU HAVE A TREE BRANCH THAT

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:12.025
MAYBE LAYING ON TOP OF THE TWO

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:13.593
FACES OF THE LINE SOMETHING

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.395
CALLED A HIGH IMPEDANCE FALL.

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:16.763
ALSO WE LOOK AT THIS AS ANOTHER

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.565
TOOL IN OUR TOOL KIT FIVE THIS

01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:20.066
COUPLED WITH AUSTIN PARDONING

01:52:20.133 --> 01:52:22.035
PROGRAM OF COVERED DOCTOR CAN

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.437
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE. RISK

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.972
PROFILE NOW WE'VE GOT A FAIRLY

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:28.241
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MILES

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:29.809
WITH IPHONES BUT DISTRIBUTION

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:32.078
FROM FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:34.114
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.381
FIVE YEARS PLUS ON ON THE

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:36.783
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TYPE OF

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:39.986
TECHNOLOGY- TECHNOLOGY THAT-

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:42.088
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS-

01:52:42.155 --> 01:52:42.856
SOMETHING CALLED THE

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.591
DISTRIBUTION TRANSMISSION

01:52:44.657 --> 01:52:46.025
SUBSTATION FIRE ACTION SCHEME.

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.727
ALREADY USING A SERIES OF

01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:50.096
CAMERAS AND SENSORS ARE MOUNTED

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:51.431
ON OUR EQUIPMENT TO QUICKLY

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:53.032
DETECT OBJECTS THAT ARE

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:55.034
APPROACHING. ENERGIZED POWER

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.703
LINES AND WE CAN DO THE

01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.605
SHOPPING FOR THE AUTO OBJECT

01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:00.440
ACTUALLY ENDS UP IMPACTING. THE

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:01.774
OVERHEAD LINE INCLUDING A

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:03.109
POTENTIAL SPARKED ACTION BY THE

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:05.145
PATENT HOLDERS- DECEMBER OF

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.280
LAST YEAR. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:08.915
ANOTHER WAY TO GOT A WHOLE LOT

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.417
TRANSMISSION LINE. OF SEVENTY

01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:12.485
MILES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE-

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:15.722
THE POINT IS OPERATIONALLY- FOR

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:17.624
THIS YEAR AND THAT AS WE ARE.

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:18.825
OKAY THE SUCCESSFUL WE

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.960
ANTICIPATE I THINK WE CANNOT

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:21.628
QUICKLY ASKING A LOT THAT

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:36.543
IMPLEMENTATION GOING. TO TWENTY

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.244
TWENTY ONE. MARTIN'S BURKE.

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:44.851
YEAH USE OUR PUBLIC. YES YES

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:47.187
OUR- WHILE DOZENS LIKE IT THE

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:50.456
END OF THE NAY MORE THANK BOB

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:52.992
CHECKING. THAT YOU PEOPLE THAT.

01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:57.397
ON THE WAYS IN WHICH- MARCH

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:58.765
TWENTY MORMON WE WILL BE WITH

01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:02.302
MY TECHNOLOGY. SO PERHAPS I CAN

01:54:02.368 --> 01:54:05.738
JUMP AND I THINK THAT RIGHT WE-

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:06.306
PILINGS MAYBE I CAN OUT THE

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.408
COMMITTEE ALSO IS- ACTIVELY

01:54:08.474 --> 01:54:10.410
CALL. WITH A SENIOR MY P.

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:12.378
THAT'S OF OUR- WE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.580
DOING THAT FOR YEARS NOW- ALONG

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:14.414
WITH WORK WITH THE UTILITIES

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.915
ARE THE GLOBE SEARCHES ARE. WE

01:54:15.982 --> 01:54:18.918
DO WORK. A RAPPER TALK LIMITING

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:19.919
WHICH IT DOES AN IMPORTANT TECH

01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:22.255
THIS YEAR- AND SO WE'RE MOVING

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:23.690
FORWARD WITH- WITH THE TEST OF

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.091
THAT PROGRAMS LIKE TO THREE

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:29.796
DIFFERENT VARIETIES- WERE. I

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:31.130
WOULD EACH ONE OF THEM. ANOTHER

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.665
TECHNO YOU. FEEL A LITTLE BIT

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.834
PILOT- DISTRIBUTION BALTIC

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:36.302
DISSIPATION. SO THIS IS

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:37.804
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:39.439
WINTERKORN'S WITHIN THE LINE

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.841
AND IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS BEFORE

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:44.344
THE BAKER. JOHN MENTIONED-

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:46.079
DETECTING- ALL FALLING LINE

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:48.147
THIS IS A- PRE FILING LINE IF

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:51.317
YOU WILL- YOU IDENTIFY THINGS

01:54:51.384 --> 01:54:53.553
LIKE. YOUR MICRO. PATTERNS IN

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:55.288
THE IN THE- SINGLES COMING YOUR

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:57.357
CIRCUITS. AND CAN GO OUT AND

01:54:57.423 --> 01:54:58.324
INVESTIGATE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:00.927
FOUND EVIDENCE OF. LINES ALLOW.

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:02.929
HAVING OCCURRED THAT WE WOULD

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.297
NEVER SEE IT DOESN'T RISE TO

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:05.999
FAULT IT DOESN'T RISE TO BOOK-

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:08.301
SPARKING YET- PUT IT IN THE

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:11.437
NEXT. TO DO THAT WE- WERE

01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:12.639
TARGETING AROUND A HUNDRED THIS

01:55:12.705 --> 01:55:13.473
YEAR WE'VE GOT IN ON SIXTY

01:55:13.539 --> 01:55:15.508
CIRCUITS AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:17.143
AROUND ELEVEN HUNDRED CIRCUITS.

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.611
DISTRIBUTION IN OUR CHOIR SIX

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.680
NOT INSIGNIFICANT. THE OTHER IS

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.649
EARLY FALL DETECTION REPAIR

01:55:22.715 --> 01:55:23.816
WELL WHICH IS TO BE FAULTED

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:25.618
DISSIPATION THIS ACTUALLY USES

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:27.553
RADIO WAVES. AND SENSES OTHER

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:28.755
TYPES OF FAULTS BUT HE GIVES

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.490
YOU A BETTER IDEA OF WHERE CALL

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:33.626
MAYBE. I THINK FOR US AND AS IT

01:55:33.693 --> 01:55:36.262
RELATES TO PS PS AND OVERALL

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:40.600
MITIGATIONS- D. B. CONCEPT IS.

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.669
IS MANY OVERLAPPING TOOLS TO

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.837
PROTECT AND MINIMIZE THE THREAT

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:47.240
OF A FIRE. IS THE PATH TO

01:55:47.307 --> 01:55:50.043
ELIMINATING PS PS IT PROBABLY.

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.244
I'M LIKELY TO BE ANY ONE OF

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:54.013
THESE TECHNOLOGIES- AND BY THE

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.581
WAY MACHINE LEARNING AND ALL

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:57.383
THAT IS BEING APPLIED TO. ALL

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.217
THE SIGNATURES WERE GETTING

01:55:58.284 --> 01:56:01.321
FROM- THESE NEW INSTRUMENTS AND

01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:03.022
NEW TECHNOLOGIES OUT WHICH WILL

01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:04.891
HELP US BE. REALLY ABLE TO

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:07.727
PROTECT WORKERS A KIRK- HAVE

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:08.961
YOU HAVE IT OKAY FOR US IN BOTH

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:09.762
THE NORMAL HEART MEDICATION

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:12.632
PLAN. AND OVERALL GREAT PLAN IN

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:14.200
THE YEARS TO COME. BUT IT'S

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:15.968
WILL BE YEAR ON YEAR WE'RE

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:16.703
GONNA NEED TO MAKE THESE

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:20.239
INVESTMENTS- THEY'RE- PROBABLY.

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:21.941
PROBABLY WE DON'T SEE A SILVER

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:24.310
BULLET. HE HAD TO ELIMINATE THE

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:36.456
SPLC'S WANNABE ARTWORK. LOTS OF

01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:38.157
IT AND ANY COUPLE. AN OVERLAP

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:41.661
TECHNO WILL GET THERE. GIVEN

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.429
ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WALLS WELL.

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:50.269
I'M AS THE OF YES YES STATE ALL.

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:54.273
YES I'M GONNA GO. CONCERT I'M

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:58.010
SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR IT- THE-

BECAUSE WE AS A LEGISLATURE

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:16.048
COULD NOT GET TO A PLACE. WHERE

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:17.750
WE COULD AMEND ARTICLE ONE

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:19.852
SECTION NINETEEN OF THE STATE

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:22.154

DOCTOR OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION

THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE BECAUSE

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:32.098
OF THE LIABILITY OF THESE FIRES

01:59:32.164 --> 01:59:34.667
WERE SO INCREDIBLE AND THE COST

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:36.302
WE'RE GOING TO BE SO GREAT AND

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:37.837
I KNOW THAT THAT THE CHAIR AND

01:59:37.904 --> 01:59:42.341

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:45.478
A ARE THE CONFERENCE- WE ALSO-

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:47.346
ENDED UP COMING UP WITH THE

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:49.482
ENORMOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

01:59:49.549 --> 01:59:50.883
BUT IT SURE WAS THE- I WAS THE

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.819
LEAD AUTHOR ON ON AB TEN FIFTY

01:59:53.886 --> 01:59:54.754
FOUR TO COME UP WITH A WILDFIRE

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.622
FUND THAT HAS. BILLIONS OF

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:57.623
DOLLARS OF CLAIMS PAYING

01:59:57.690 --> 01:59:59.559
CAPACITY WHY BECAUSE THESE

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:01.561
FIRES THE COST OF THEM ARE

02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:03.629
GREAT AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE

02:00:03.696 --> 02:00:04.897
COULD NEVER GET TO THE FACT

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:07.166
THAT WE COULD. AMEND OR FIX

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.335
THAT SECTION OF THE STATE

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:10.903
CONSTITUTION WE UNDERSTAND

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:12.672
THERE'S LIABILITY THAT'S THERE.

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:13.673
MY QUESTION IS THAT'S THE

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:14.874
STATEMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:16.175
IT A QUESTION THAT IWAS GOING

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:17.443
TO HAVE IS THE ONE THAT. A

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:19.812
DOCTOR CORK- ENDED UP ASKING

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:21.681
AND THAT IS. THAT THE GOAL

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:23.416
NEEDS TO BE TO BE ABLE TO LIMIT

02:00:23.482 --> 02:00:25.618
THESE P. S. P. S. ADVANCE AS

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:26.452
MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO

02:00:26.519 --> 02:00:29.188
APPROVE. ON UP ON THE SYSTEM

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:30.489
AND WHEN THERE'S TECHNOLOGY

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:33.192
AVAILABLE. OF IT ARE WE AT THE

02:00:33.259 --> 02:00:35.094
PLACE- TO BE ABLE TO GET TO

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:35.895
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO DE

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:37.396
ENERGIZE AND I THINK. THE

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:38.898
ANSWER WAS THERE AT LEAST BYE

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:41.100
BYE BYE ONE OF ONE OF THE FOLKS

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:43.102
SAYING THAT WITHIN THE NEXT.

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:44.870
TEN YEARS MAYBE WE'RE NOT GOING

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.505
TO SEE THEM BUT THE GOAL NEEDS

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:48.174
TO BE TO TRY TO LIMIT THEM. BUT

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.442
WE NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:50.810
WITH OUR PARTNERS AT TO MAKE

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.612
SURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM.

02:00:52.678 --> 02:00:53.980
THAT WORKS AND WE JUST HAVE TO

02:00:54.046 --> 02:00:55.615
BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND VERY

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:57.516
CAREFUL. THAT WE DON'T START

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.585
BRINGING UP A LOT OF THIS A

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.387
NEGATIVE RHETORIC TO GET PEOPLE

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:02.855
ALL FIRED UP. ONCE AGAIN WE'VE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.357

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.631
ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:13.866
THERE'S CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES

02:01:13.933 --> 02:01:16.068
AND EX AND IMPLEMENTING. THE

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:18.004
GUIDELINES IN OR YOU CAN SAY

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:19.839

AND IT'S LIKE OKAY WE'RE GOING

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:22.108
TO DO IT AND THEN IT DOESN'T

02:01:22.174 --> 02:01:23.709
GET DONE. I THINK EVERYONE

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:25.878
UNDERSTANDS DE ENERGIZING LINES

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:27.046
TECHNOLOGY IT ALL GOES HAND IN

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:30.483
HAND. THE UNDERGROUND IN THE

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:32.585
LINES FOR WINDOW VENTS IS ALSO

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:34.086
ANOTHER DETERRENT SO THERE'S A

02:01:34.153 --> 02:01:35.454
LOT OF THERE'S A MENU. OF

02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:36.789
THINGS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:38.357
NINE OH ONE. AND WHAT'S

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:39.625
EXPECTED IN THESE MITIGATION

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:41.594
PLANS AND THE P. U. C. HAS

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:43.829
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:44.930
THAT THOSE PLANS ARE BEING

02:01:44.997 --> 02:01:46.632
MONITORED AND IT HERE TO AND

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:48.934
WHAT WE'RE SEEING.IS THAT NOT

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.936
THE SAME KIND OF EFFORT. YOU

02:01:51.003 --> 02:01:51.737

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:53.072
EXPECTATION THAT NOT

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:55.341
WITHSTANDING. THE CHALLENGES

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:58.778
THAT THIS COMES WITH- THAT. YOU

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:00.880
STILL HAVE TO STEP UP. AND I

02:02:00.946 --> 02:02:03.749
THINK THAT'S WHERE OF THIS

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:05.451
OVERSIGHT IS TO SORT OF. NO PUN

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:07.319
INTENDED KEEP THE FIRE LIT-

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:12.925
RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR-

INFORMATIVE HEARING I WANT TO

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:18.264
START BY SAYING THAT WILDFIRE

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:20.199
IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MY

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:22.301
CONSTITUENTS WORRY ABOUT MOST

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:23.969
IS WHAT KEEPS THEM UP AT NIGHT

02:02:24.036 --> 02:02:25.071
I REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:26.605
ARE ON THE WILDLAND URBAN

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.307
INTERFACE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

02:02:28.374 --> 02:02:29.809
AND THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.310
AFRAID OF UTILITY BECAUSE

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:35.147
WILDFIRES. AND THEN IN TWENTY

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:36.882
NINETEEN WHO WE WERE DEVASTATED

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:38.551
BY THE PS PS EVENTS THAT WERE

02:02:38.617 --> 02:02:41.821
SO POORLY MANAGED WE WERE OUT

02:02:41.887 --> 02:02:43.155
FOR ALMOST A WEEK IN SOME

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:44.423
INSTANCES WITH LITTLE TO NO

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:46.058
COMMUNICATION HOSPITALS WERE

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:47.226
TOLD THEY WOULDN'T BE TURNED UP

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:48.994
DE ENERGIZED AND THEY WERE DE

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:51.897
ENERGIZED WITH NO NOTICE- I

02:02:51.964 --> 02:02:53.099
THINK THAT I REALLY WANT TO

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:55.267
THANK THE DIRECTORS AND

02:02:55.334 --> 02:02:56.068
PRESIDENT BADGER FOR

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:58.804
HIGHLIGHTING. THE DANGER OF

02:02:58.871 --> 02:02:59.538
THESE EVENTS I THINK THAT IS

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.707
WHAT GOES UNMENTIONED SO

02:03:01.774 --> 02:03:03.509
FREQUENTLY WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:04.944
NEED TO HAVE THESE EVENTS IN

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:06.679
ORDER TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.280
BUT WE LOSE LIVES WHEN WE HAVE

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:10.649
THESE EVENTS AS WELL NUMBERS OF

02:03:10.716 --> 02:03:12.985
SENIORS FELL DURING THE DAYS ON

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:14.787
AND P. S. P. S. EVENTS THAT LED

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:16.355
TO THEIR DEATHS. AND I THINK

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.590
THAT NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:20.292
BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT INCIDENTS

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.961
THAT ARE WITHOUT HORRIBLE

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:23.229
OUTCOMES AND SO WE NEED TO BE

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:25.164
AS CAREFUL AS WE CAN AND HOW WE

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:27.199
USE THEM HOW LONG THEY LAST AND

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:28.934
HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED. I DO

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:30.669
ALSO WANT TO CREDIT PRESIDENT

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:33.506

WERE PRESENTED TODAY WE SAW

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.348
INCREDIBLE DECREASE IN THE

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:44.683
IMPACT OF PS PS THIS YEAR I

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.885
HEARD FROM NONE OF MY HOSPITALS

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:46.752
THIS YEAR THAT THEY WERE DE

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:48.187
ENERGIZED WITH NO NOTICE SO

02:03:48.254 --> 02:03:50.256
THAT WAS GREAT NEWS FOR ME-

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:53.025
AND- YOU KNOW. IT WAS DONE IN A

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.960
WAY THAT WAS BETTER WE HAVE A

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:57.630
LOT OF WAYS TO GO BUT I DO WANT

02:03:57.696 --> 02:03:58.998
TO CREDIT THE VAST IMPROVEMENT

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:02.968
IN JUST A. SINGLE YEAR TO THE

02:04:03.035 --> 02:04:03.536
IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS. I'M

02:04:03.602 --> 02:04:05.504
MIKE QUESTION FOR. DIRECTOR

02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:07.106
THOMAS JACOBS IS THAT YOU

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:09.341
MENTIONED THAT IN THE TWENTY

02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:09.909
ONE TWENTY ONE REPORTS THAT

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:13.245
WAS. PUT FORWARD JUST RECENTLY

02:04:13.312 --> 02:04:15.648
PG&amp;E SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

02:04:15.714 --> 02:04:18.083
THE PROJECTIONS WERE FOR TWENTY

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:18.717
TWENTY ONE FOR THE PS PS EVENTS

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:20.553
OR THEY WERE. UNDETERMINED CAN

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.087
YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.355
ABOUT THAT IS THAT AGAIN WE

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:24.657
EXPECT CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:25.658
AND I WOULD EXPECT TO

02:04:25.724 --> 02:04:28.594
PROJECTION TO SHOW THAT. BUT IT

02:04:28.661 --> 02:04:29.161
SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS AND WHAT

02:04:29.228 --> 02:04:30.830
WAS IN THE REPORT. SURE I CAN

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:33.032
BE THAT SO THE REPORT THAT WE

02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:34.200
REQUIRE THEM TO SUBMIT

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:36.569
PROJECTIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:37.136
ONE AND NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:39.538
PERFORMANCE METRICS- PG&amp;E DID

02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:41.207
SUPPLY SOME OF THOSE. SOME OF

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:42.575
THEM THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT

02:04:42.641 --> 02:04:44.376
SUPPLY YET BECAUSE THERE IS

02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:46.512
GOOD CURRENT- A PROPOSED

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.379
CONDITIONS THROUGH THE FEDERAL

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:49.148
COURT. THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:51.016
IMPACT THE NUMBER OF PS PS

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:52.151
EVENTS AND THE SCOPE OF THOSE

02:04:52.218 --> 02:04:53.819
EVENTS. BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:56.021
THAT SO THEY DID NOT INCLUDE

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:57.122
THAT PRODUCTION AND THEN WHEN

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:58.290
THAT IS SETTLED THEY WILL THEY

02:04:58.357 --> 02:04:59.758
HAVE COMMITTED ALREADY TO ME

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.093
THEY WILL SUBMIT THAN THEIR

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:01.894
PROJECTIONS ONCE THEY HAVE

02:05:01.961 --> 02:05:04.263

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:06.031
THOSE PROJECTIONS BECAUSE I

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:07.499
THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

02:05:07.566 --> 02:05:08.500
POINT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:10.269
WATCH. YOUR OVER YOUR THE

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:11.170
IMPROVEMENT BUT WE CAN ONLY DO

02:05:11.237 --> 02:05:12.304
THAT IF WE HAVE LAST YEAR'S

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.672
DATA PROJECTIONS AND HOW THEY

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:14.340
PERFORM AGAINST THOSE

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:16.976
PROJECTIONS. AND I ALSO HAD A

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:19.078
QUESTION SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:21.647
FORECAST ABOUT HOW- I

GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE WE NO

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:25.885
LONGER NEED THESE PSCS EVENTS

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:27.686
AND THAT PEOPLE. THAT WE ARE A

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:30.055
LOT WE ARE ABLE TO RELIABLY AND

SAFELY PROVIDE ENERGY TO OUR

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:32.958
COMMUNITIES WHICH SHOULD BE THE

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:35.060
EXPECTATION THAT I THINK ALL OF

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.996
US SHOULD HAVE FOR I'LL USE-

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:38.530
AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:40.032
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY MY QUESTION

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:42.635
FOR- THE FOLKS AT THE P. YOU

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:43.936

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:45.938
THIS AND ALSO. THE I USE IF

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:48.474
THEY SO DESIRE IS. HOW ARE WE

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.808
SORT OF IN ANSWERING DOCTOR HER

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:50.776
QUESTION THERE WAS A LOT OF

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:52.177
TECHNOLOGY TO SCOTT IF THEY'RE

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:53.512
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OBVIOUSLY

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:55.681
HARDENING THE GRID. MAINTENANCE

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:57.383
THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALWAYS

02:05:57.449 --> 02:05:58.651
TO GET TO A SAFER GRADE THAT

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:00.552
WOULDN'T REQUIRE. AN D.

02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:02.187
ENERGIES ASIAN HOW ARE WE

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.490
TRACKING THAT- I KNOW WE'RE

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:06.392
TALKING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT BUT

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:07.793
HOW ARE WE SORT OF SETTING A

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:14.400
GOAL TO. KNOW. D. ENERGIES

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:15.034
ATION AND GETTING THEIR- WELL.

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.803
THANK VERY- YEAH- I AM GOING TO

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:20.039
ADD CAROLINE TO TALK ABOUT THAT

02:06:20.105 --> 02:06:21.607
BECAUSE IT FITS WELL INTO THE

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:25.110
WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND-

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.479
STRATEGIES AND THEN METRICS

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.648
THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED TO HOLD

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:31.417
FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:32.851
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS OTHER

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.787
STRATEGIES FOR THE PS PS

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:37.122
CAROLINE SURE SO THAT GOES TO

02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:38.457
THE HEART OF HOW WE EVALUATE

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.225
THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:41.560
AND WHAT WE ESTABLISHED LAST

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:44.229
YEAR WAS A VERY CLEAR STRUCTURE

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:46.298
ON. THE TYPE OF CONTENT NOT

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:47.566
WITH THE ACTUAL CONTENT IS

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:48.367
BECAUSE THE POLICE HAVE TELL US

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:50.202
WHAT THEIR PLAN IS BUT HOW THE

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.137
STRUCTURE THAT CONTENT SO THAT

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:53.973
WE CAN DIVE INTO THAT SO

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.407
SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION IS

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:56.408
WE'VE CREATED TEN DIFFERENT

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:59.611
CATEGORIES THAT WE- OF REQUIRED

02:06:59.678 --> 02:07:01.046
UTILITIES TO SUBMIT INFORMATION

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:02.715
AND A LOT OF INCLUDING THE

02:07:02.781 --> 02:07:04.550
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND WE

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:05.918
HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO

02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:07.920
DO ANALYSIS ON THOSE SPECIFIC

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:10.622
AREAS. AND WE ASK THAT- REQUIRE

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:11.724
THE UTILITIES DISSIDENT

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:13.859
PERFORMANCE METRICS TO EACH OF

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:15.394
THOSE AREAS AND WE LOOK AT A

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:16.261
DIFFERENT SEVERAL DIFFERENT

02:07:16.328 --> 02:07:17.997
TYPES OF PERFORMANCE METRICS

02:07:18.063 --> 02:07:19.865
LEADING AND LAGGING INDICATORS

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.500
AS WELL AS THE OUTCOME METRICS

02:07:21.567 --> 02:07:22.501
AND THEN THE UTILITIES ALSO

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:24.103
OFTEN INCLUDE THEIR PROGRAM

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.938
TARGETS FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:27.306
SEXUALIZING DEVICES ARE GOING

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:30.075
TO SIT- I DO THIS YEAR OR HOW

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:31.076
MANY TREES ARE GONNA EXPECT

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:32.511
THAT TYPE OF THING. ARE THEN

02:07:32.578 --> 02:07:34.480
TEAM LOOKS AT ALL OF THAT AND

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:36.615
WE PUT PUSH IN ON EACH OF THOSE

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:38.684
IN OUR ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.219
BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.920
DECIDING WHICH TOOLS THEY'RE

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.822
GOING TO USE TO TRY AND REDUCE

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:45.824
THE RISK. EACH UTILITY HAS

02:07:45.891 --> 02:07:47.226
DIFFERENT TOPOGRAPHY HAVE

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:47.960
DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASE

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.194
DIFFERENT GREAT DESIGN THAT FOR

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:51.030
THEIR JOB WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:53.098
WE'RE PROBING ON THE QUESTIONS

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:53.766
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

02:07:53.832 --> 02:07:55.200
THINKING THROUGH THAT AND

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:56.869
SPECIFICALLY ON THE EMERGING

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.704
TECHNOLOGIES WE ALSO OFTEN ASK

02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:00.205
IS THAT YOU UTILITIES A

02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:01.774
REFERENCE ALREADY ALREADY

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.842
COORDINATING WITH EACH OTHER SO

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:04.943
THAT THEY'RE LEARNING FROM EACH

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.845
OTHER. ON THE DIFFERENT PILOTS

02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:08.213
THEY'RE DOING AND THEN

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:09.281
LEVERAGING WHERE IT'S

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:12.017
APPROPRIATE ON THEIR BREAD THE-

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:19.758
THOSE LEARNINGS AND NOT EVERY.

02:08:19.825 --> 02:08:20.559
SINGLE DAY A PILOT CAN BE

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:21.093
PICKED UP AND DROPPED INTO

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:21.960
ELSE'S TERRITORY. BUT WE MAKING

THE EXTENT. OF GETTING IN FOR

02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:26.799
OUT THERE SO THEY DON'T ALL

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:27.766
HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:29.234
THAILAND. THEY DON'T ALL HAVE

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:30.302
TO THINK THROUGH THESE THINGS

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:31.770
INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE TO THE

02:08:31.837 --> 02:08:33.539
POINT- THAT WAS EARLIER BROUGHT

WANT THIS TO HAPPEN IN A VERY

02:08:37.643 --> 02:08:39.945
EFFICIENT AND FAST WAY TO BE

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:42.214
ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR PS

HE'S AFTER OKAY YOU DON'T SET

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:01.400
THAT GOAL. BUT WE ASK THEM TO
