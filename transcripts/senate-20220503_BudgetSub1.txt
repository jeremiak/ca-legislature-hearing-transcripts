REFLECT ON HOW MUCH PUBLIC COM WE IF YOU GET THAT SO WITH THAT. REMOVED ARE TO NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS RECOVERING HIGH FROM THE- PLAN AND IT'S PUTTING WEALTH TO WORK AND SO WE HAVE- EDGAR CABRAL I HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND HE IS GOING TO PRESENT ON THE TWO ITEMS THAT WE- ARE GOING TO HEAR TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH ITEM NUMBER FIVE MR CABRAL WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE CONTROL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HOURS AS TO JUST PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE- PRINCE CONTROLLER EDUCATION ELEMENTS OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PLAN WHICH WAS RELEASED LAST WEEK. FROM FALLS WALKED THROUGH THE KEY COMPONENTS HERE THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR ELEMENTS- THE SHOWN IN YOUR AGENDA I'M PETER FIVE PAGES FIVE AND SIX. AND THE FIRST IS AN LONG DISCRETIONARY FUNDING INCREASED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR A FEE OF FIVE- THAT THIS IS AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF PROVIDED EACH YEAR. AND UNDER THE PLANET THIS WOULD BE FIVE BILLION ON TOP OF THE COLI IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THAT WOULD GROW TO SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IS TO BE AN ONGOING. OUR MEDICATION NEVER GO BEYOND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE NEXT ELEMENT IS A COVERT RELATED LEARNING RECOVERY GRANT. THIS WILL BE TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND A ONE TIME PROP MAY BE EIGHT. AM AND IT WOULD BE. ALLOCATED BASED ON A FORMULA- TO ALL LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND IT COULD BE USED FOR A BROAD VARIETY OF. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INTENDED IT. JOHN BROUGHT. THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- SO THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF OUR SENSIBLE IN THE LOBBY USES- BUT THEY WOULDN'T. I'M COVERING STAFFING COSTS- TO SALAS BENEFITS PENSIONS- FOR STAFF THAT ARE HIRED FOR TARGETED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS LITERACY COACHES OR MENTAL HEALTH- ANIMAL SERVICES. THEN THE NEXT ELEMENT IS A STUDENT IN RICHMOND BLOCK GRANT WOULD BE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME COSTS NINETY EIGHT- AND THIS WOULD BE- BUT PUTTING THAT WOULD AGAIN BE DISTRIBUTED BY. THE FORMULA AND CAN BE USED BY LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES FOR A VARIETY OF STUDENT ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING. OUR TO MUSIC- PROGRAMS ON SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHS RELATED TOOLS- OUR INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS WHICH COULD INCLUDE BOOKS BUT ALSO OTHER LEARNING TOOLS LIKE SOFTWARE- SUFFER PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEN FINALLY- THERE IS FOR HAVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING. THIS WOULD BE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND THIS WOULD BE ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDES. TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING OVER TWO YEARS. I'M AND THE FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PLAN OF THAT AMOUNT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR TAKING FACILITIES TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF TICKET FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS. THAT CAN CAUSE A- HERE NUMBER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN. I THINK I'M GONNA MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND ADD TO THAT AND THEN RECOGNIZED MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED IN IS AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS AND THERE WAS. MMHM CONDITIONALLY OUR OUR COST OF LIVING INCREASES OR COLA FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE THAT WAS OVER 5% THAT WAS WHAT WAS IN THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET. AND THEN- WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OR WILL BE MADE- IN THE MAY REVISED JUST BASED ON REVENUES. IT'S LIKELY TO GO TO SOMETHING AROUND SIX AND A HALF PERCENT AND THEN WHAT WAS JUST DESCRIBED BY MR CABRAL. IS A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT. OF SEVEN POINT 26% SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WITH THOSE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. YEAR TO YEAR OVER LAST YEAR. IS NEARING FOURTEEN PERCENTAGE THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT TWO IN A IN A ROTH PERCENTAGE SO. THIS IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND WHEN WE HAD OUR NINE HEARINGS IN FEBRUARY AND INTO MARCH WE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS. THAT THEY WEREN'T SURE THE 5% HELP THEM KEEP UP AND I THINK THIS ARE WILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND WE ALSO HAVE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ONE TIME VERSUS. OUR ON GOING IN PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THERE IS A TEN BILLION ONE TIME CODE RELATED LEARNING RECOVERY BLOCK GRANT WHICH IS ON TOP OF THE COST OF LIVING INCREASE I JUST DESCRIBED AND THAT WOULD ALLOW. INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS THE LEARNING LOSS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE FUNDED LAST YEAR- WHEN WE DID THE SCHOOL RE OPENING PLAN THERE WAS A LARGE CHUNK OF LEARNING LOSS. THIS ALLOWS THE ONE TIME GRANTS. TO ADDRESS THAT AND TO PRESUPPOSE A QUESTION FROM SENATOR MEN WHO IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE PERSON EARNERS BY DOWN. THIS COULD BE USED FOR OUR PENSION COSTS AT THE OF THE RAND AND THE AND THE NEW ONCE WE FACE IN ADDRESSING THE PENSIONS. IS THAT. A PERSON STIRRERS. EXISTS MAY BE IN ALMOST AN IDENTICAL OR MAJOR WAY OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION OF NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE THERE CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND THE STATE. AND IF YOU DO A PURSE BY DOWN THAT IS WITH THE GENERAL FUND SURPLUS IT APPLIES TO ALL THOSE DISTRICTS AND WHEN YOU GET TO SCHOOLS IT ISN'T AS BIG AS IT MIGHT BE AND SO BY OUR- SCHOOLS THE DISCRETION. TO DO THE LEARNING LAWCENTER AND INCLUDE PENSION COSTS IT'S A WAY OF DIRECTING MONEY TRUST TO SCHOOLS. ARE OUT FOR THEIR NEEDS BUT ALLOWING THEM TO MEET THEIR PENSION OBLIGATIONS SO IT IS A WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WANT TO- FOR CLOSE ANY FUTURE COMMENTS ON THIS BECAUSE- I THINK THEY'RE STILL VERY RELEVANT. AND THEN WE AND WE DO THE ONE TIME OF GRANT BLOCK GRANTS FOR ARTS MUSIC AND TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SCHOOL KITCHEN. R. AND LOCAL. FOR MEALS IS ALSO A ONE TIME. AND THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS- BUT THAT WE IMPLEMENTATION FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- IF ANY OF US ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BASIC A DISTRICTS THAT THEY WERE NOT FUNDED FOR THIS. AND SO THIS ALLOWS GRANTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION THAT BOTH BASIC AID AND NON BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SO IS IT ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE AND THIS ALSO COVERS THE FIRST PART OF SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION COSTS. SO THIS IS A MAJOR POINT OF INVESTMENT AND- I APPRECIATE ARE MR CABRAL'S- IN ACTION BUT WANT TO PUT A FINER POINT IN. ABI HAPPY TO STILL COMMENT AT SOME POINT BUT I WANT TO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEY HAVE. A CENTRO TROUBLED- YOU'RE GOOD SHE'S GOOD THAT MEANS SENATOR MEANT I THANK SAID A FEW QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AS WELL- SO MISTER CABRERA YOU JUST OF FOLLOW UP ON CENTER LAYERS- QUESTION OR COMMENT ABOUT COLA. ON THE APPLES TO APPLES HOW MUCH WAS THE INITIAL CALL INCREASE. AGAIN WAS AT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY. THAT WAS A THAT WAS A FIVE POINT ADJUSTMENT I BELIEVE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCOUNT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I BELIEVE THE- WHERE THE RANGE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO IF YOU BILLION I THINK I HAVE TWO POINT THREE OR THREE POINT EIGHT WRITTEN DOWN BUT BUT SOMETHING IN THAT RANGE IN. THE PROPOSED ELSE INCREASES THE L. C. F. F. THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THE STATE SENATE BUDGET IS- LET'S SEE TWENTY TWO AND A HALF BILLION OVER THREE YEARS. YES IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF THE L. C. F. ONE ITSELF IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE ADDING UP TO ON TOP OF THE CALL WILL BE TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON ONGOING. BASIS I GOT AND I APPRECIATE THAT JUST BECAUSE I DO HEAR FROM A LOT OF TEACHERS. IN MY DISTRICT- THE END THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCREASE WOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE COVERING INFLATION RIGHT NOW GIVEN- THAT THE HIGH INCREASES IN PRICES THAT WE'RE SEEING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS SO. THIS SEEMS LIKE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO PRUDENTLY. OPERATE SUSTAINABLY INCREASE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING GIVEN ESPECIALLY THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN TEACHER RETENTION- TEACHER. RECRUITMENT EIGHT YOU KNOW DUE TO THE COLD IN A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS SO I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE- CENTER LAYERS POINT ABOUT- PROVIDING ACTUAL FUNDING FOR I. T. K. FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING. NOT JUST BASIC AID DISTRICTS BUT I THINK A LOT OF. OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE NON BASIC AID DISTRICTS HAVE EXPRESSED IS THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WE'RE GONNA FIND THE FUNDING TO EITHER BUILD THESE THINGS FROM SCRATCH OR TO CONVERT THEM- BASED ON EXISTING FACILITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET EVEN AT THE EXISTING CLASSROOM THAT. HAS THE SPACE. READY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IN THAT AGE RANGE. AS I THINK THIS IS A VERY- IT PREFERABLE APPROACH IN MY MIND I GUESS I MAY HAVE A BIAS BECAUSE I AM IN THIS BODY BUT- YOU KNOW PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY TO THE ELEVEN THOUSAND PLUS ELEAZAR WE HAVE- TEACHING AYE AYE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS IN THE STATE. I DIFFERENT LEDS OBVIOUSLY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND PROVIDING BILL THE BUT IN SORT OF GENERAL SILOS- FOR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WE PRIORITIZE. THE LCS THAT INCREASES BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE OR WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THAT CENTER WHERE PROVIDES- I'M ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE COVERT RELATED. LEARNING RECOVERY BLOCK GRANT BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG NEED WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. AS STUDENTS RETURNING WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL ANXIETY ISSUES- AT ALL AGE RANGES AND AGAIN I HAVE THREE KIDS THEY TALK ABOUT IT I TALK TO THEIR TEACHERS I TALK TO THEIR PRINCIPAL. HI EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BROUGHT ON MICHAEL IN NINETEEN AND THIS- BUDGET ACTUALLY- DOES PRIORITIZE THESE THINGS SO- I AM VERY. APPRECIATIVE OF THIS GENERAL APPROACH AND I LOOK FOR TO SEE WHERE THIS GOES THANK YOU AND JUST BEFORE I RECOGNIZE SENATOR OF JOB. STATE. THAT'S MAN MADE. PUN ON THE BUT- AND LYFT ARE UP. TO AND EAT TAKE THE BAIT SO- JUST NOTE THAT FOR RECORD US GROVE. WELL I THINK ROTH POINT JUST. SOME SEEDS HERE IN THEIR HOME GAMES. I'M GLAD THAT YOU GOT TO THE CORE OF THE ISSUE RIGHT AWAY- SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AS SENATOR LAYERED. I DISCUSSION IS FOR THE L. A. O. AND IS IT POSSIBLE TO SHARE THE FORMULA THAT THE CODE RELATED LEARNING RECOVERY BLOCK GRANT AND THIS GENERATION BLACK GRANT WILL USE THIS TO READ THE FUNDS. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION% BUDGET- IF THERE IF THERE IS A SPECIFIC FORMULA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED YET- BUT SOMETHING THAT'S YET TO BE DETERMINED. OKAY SO WE DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE YET- AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. IS WILL THERE BE ANY LANGUAGE WITH REGARDS TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT THE MONEY IS HEADED AND HOW IS HEADED SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A REPORT BACK AT THE END. OH MY GOD THAT'S SOMETHING I'M NOT FAMILIAR IF THERE'S IF THERE'S SPECIFIC. ELEMENTS OF THE BEVERAGE. THAT REQUIRE- PARTICULAR REPORTING I MEAN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN. IN PREVIOUS ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATIONS LIKE THIS. BEFORE BUT AMOUNTS ARE I AM NOT. AWARE OF IF THAT BEETLE HAS BEEN FINALIZED YET. WELL THE FIVE JUST IF I MAYES CENTERED OR JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE ALLOCATING ALL OF THESE FUNDS. THAT WE DO HAVE SOME SORT OF MEASURES IN PLACE THAT WIND IT YOU KNOW ALLOW FOR US TO SEE HOW THE MONEY WAS ULTIMATELY SPENT AND WHETHER OR NOT- WE SAW ANY BENEFIT- THAT. THAT I WAS A JUSTIFIED ALLOCATE THE MONEY BECAUSE THERE'S JUSTIFICATION FOR BUT JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE IN THAT WE'RE DOING. RIGHT BY THAT MONEY IN THE INVESTMENT THAT WERE REALLOCATING IT TO JUST STAFF. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE ALLOCATE ALL THESE. ALL THESE FILES MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND WE'RE DOING. LET ME MAKE A COMMENT TO THAT BECAUSE ARM. THIS IS INFORMATION ONLY. AND THERE WILL BE A TIME. WHEN WHAT I HAVE HEARD THE FINAL. THING IS COMES BACK TO US FOR DISCUSSION AND A VOTE. IN OUR- BAR I THINK BY THEN WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE AT LEAST HAVE THE STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE AN ACCOUNTABILITY GOES TWO WAYS IT'S THERE'S AUDITS AND REPORTS THAT CALM NOW ON THANKS. BYE WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION OF- CITING THOSE AREN'T ENOUGH OR THE OPTION OF DECIDING THAT WE WON'T HAVE AN OVER SIZED HEARING IN THE INTRO MORE SOMETIME BEFORE. ASK QUESTIONS TO HAVE THEM REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR AS THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT SO THAT WE KNOW SO WE SHOULD JUST THINK ABOUT. WHAT MIGHT BE THE POSSIBILITIES WITH OF. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ITEM FIVE. WHOA ARE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY ON THAT IT WAS VERY HIGH LEVEL BUT IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL SO I'M GLAD WE HAD A CHANCE TO. WILL MOVE TO ITEM SIX WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SUPPORTS. AND ALL RECOGNIZE MR CABRAL WOULD. AMERICA GROUP ROADS THAT OUR FOCUS FOR I'M STILL DESCRIBING FEEDBACK FROM DEMOCRATS PLAN REGARDING STATE PRESCHOOL ARE BETTER OFF FIVE DIFFERENT- ELEMENTS THE PROPOSAL AND THEY'RE AWFUL SO IN YOUR CHEN DOMPIG SIX. THE FIRST IS AN INCREASE IN- REIMBURSEMENT RATES WOULD CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSED. INCREASES FOR ALL TUCKER AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS- IN IN THE SENATE AND CUTS PLANNED TO THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE OF THE REGIONAL MAKET RATES. BEGINNING IN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT THE CURRENT RATESARE AT THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE ABOUT THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE RIGHT NOW AND ALSO WHEN I WAS THERE BUT JUST TOOK EFFECT. JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE ESTIMATES OF THE COST ARE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS ONGOING. HALF FULL OF THE- AND THIS WOULD BE A COMPANIES OF MY NINETY EIGHT PROBABLY GENERAL BECAUSE THE PRESCHOOL FUNDING FOR A COUPLE. OF BOTH. ON THE NEXT P. FOR B- CALLED OUR EXTENDING ADJUSTMENT FOR TODDLERS ALL- AFRAID OF THREE YEAR. SECONDLY WHAT THE MEANS IS YOU PROVIDE RATE AND- FOR FIVE THREE YEAR OLD LOW FUND OF THE SAME RATE AS AS WORK- TODDLER UNDER THE SYSTEM- AND I WILL ALSO TAKE A- UNDER THE PROPOSAL BE. JAN FIRST OF TWENTY TWO THREE- YEAH APPLE. OUR SYSTEM TO BE FOUR HUNDREDFORTY MILLION- THE NEXT PIECE IF SIX. UP TO DIFFERENT- NINETEEN FLEXIBLE THAT WE'RE- AS PART OF THE DURING THE PANDEMIC. ONE IS TO WAIT FOR FEES FOR THIS TWO YEAR- SO THAT THE TYPICALLY THERE'S A MOM FEES THAT. HEY WITH A DEPENDING ON WHETHER ARE IN THE SCALE- WHEN THEY ARE RECEIVING A CARE- THIS WILL WAIVE THOSE FOR TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS IT'S BEEN THE CASE. AND THEN MAKE THE PERFECT. AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS RELATED TO CONTRACT PROVIDERS TO HOLD THEM HARMLESS- FROM FROM- LOWER ENROLLMENT SO SINCE THEY ARE FUNDED BASED ON THEIR CONTRACTED. BENEFITS BENEFITS OF ATTENDING THE ROMAN IS COMING IN MUCH LOWER THEY ARE FUNDED AT THAT HIGHER AMOUNT TO- HELP OUR PRICING PROTECTION GIVEN THAT THERE ALL. OUT OF. THE MARKET. SIXTEEN WOULD BE FOR ONE. YEAR THE NEXT COMPONENT- CHANGES IN DIRECT TO ALL OF THE SO I CURRENT. I'M CONSISTENT WITH OTHER ABOUT FOR BE- INCOME IS EIGHTY PER OF THE STATE INCOME AND- THE PROPOSAL IS TO INCREASE THAT TO PER OF THE STATE INCOME- AS IS CARRILLO UNDER THE THERE WOULD STILL BE PRIOR TO CEASE BASED ON SO THEY- IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SLOTS FOR EVERY INTERESTED CHILD THAT EVERY- THE CHILD THOUGHT. CHILDREN WHO COME FROM THE INCOME WE SERVE FIRST. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION IN THE PROPERTY GENERAL- OVER THREE PERIOD ESTABLISH LOCAL PRINT COUNCIL- THAT WOULD- DEVELOP. TO CONTINUE TO OF PRESCHOOL- IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. WORKING WITH MY COMMENTS MY BRANSON QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK JUST TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT- THIS IS REALLY A WHOLE SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT TRY TO MAKE THAT PROGRAMS WORK BETTER AND ADJUST TO WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. R. WOULD GO TO MY COLLEAGUES IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS A CENTER MEANT QUESTIONS. FOUR COMMENTS- HE'S GOOD AND I THOUGHT I DO AGREE pJUST SAID PRESHEAF THIS APPROACH AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT DEVELOP I HOPE WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP THIS GENERAL SET OF PRIORITIES IN PLACE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATOR TROUBLED WAS GOOD SO ARE BELIEVE IT OR NOT A WERE READY TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

WHAT A START BY THINKING OF YOU ALL AND- THE SENATE FOR THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW.

YOU KNOW A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR ALL FAMILIES SO WE BELIEVE THAT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS ONE OPTION FOR FAMILIES BUT HAVING AN EXPANDED STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT WE LIKE TO CALL UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL- IS THE BEST OPTION FOR FAMILIES SO THEY CAN CHOOSE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE WORK APPROPRIATE HOURS- DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SETTINGS FOR THEIR CHILDREN- AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THE EXPANSION OF STATE PRESCHOOL WANT TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR.
