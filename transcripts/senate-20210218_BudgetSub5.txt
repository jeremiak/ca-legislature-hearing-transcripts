HI GOOD AFTERNOON SIR MY NAME IS ROBERT HOW YOUNG I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A QUICK UPDATE ON A SURVEY THAT WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED ACROSS THE COURTS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON COURT OPERATIONS- SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT. THE COURTS WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE DURING THE PANDEMIC THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ENHANCEMENTS- THAT REALLY HELP MAINTAIN SELF ACCESS- FELT SAFE ACCESS TO JUSTICE- MOST COURTS IMPLEMENTED NEW TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS PROVIDE A REMOTE AND ONLINE SERVICES- WHILE THE COURT USER SHELTER IN PLACE OR WORK FROM HOME- SELF HELP CENTERS REMAIN OPEN NOW AND PROVIDE- THE MAJORITY OF ASSISTANCE OF REMOTELY PRETEND THAT MAKE ABOUT 90% OF THE POPULATION. VISITORS TO THE COURT I CAME INTO THE SELF HELP CENTERS- PHYSICALLY FACE TO FACE AND NOW THAT HAS SHIFTED. TO SOME 5% OF THE VISITORS YOURSELF COMING REMOTE SO THAT HAS PROVIDED A VERY IMPORTANT METHOD- TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC TO OUR SELF HELP. CORP SLOWDOWN- ARE PRIMARILY DUE. TO THIS THING AND FOR THE SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS- AS WELL AS SOME. ON WORKFORCE ABILITY OF THE. THE- WORKFORCE OF WITH- DUE TO WE DO DO TO US WORK SHE AND RE DIRECT THAT WOULD ABOUT FIVE TO TEN FOR OF THE- SHIFTING TO. AND THEN RELAY ACT SUCH AS ADDITIONAL KLAY. OUR TEMPERATURE CHECK ADDITIONAL REQUIRE TO INSURE THAT THE COURT HOUSES WERE SAVED AND TO ACCOMMODATE REMOTE PROCESS AND- DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED ABSENCE AND THE 10% OF BUDGET CUTS- IN THE CURRENT YEAR- THAT ALSO AFFECTED SOME WORKFORCE DAYS OF BEING REDUCED. IN TERMS OF JUDICIAL OFFICER AVAILABILITY THAT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY PANDEMIC RELATED LEAVES- AND ALSO JUDICIAL OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS ARE FOR SPECIFIC CASE FIVE REMAINED CONSISTENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. COMPARED TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. OUR CONTINUING FOR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL- THANK ON AVERAGE BY ABOUT ELEVEN. WITH CIVIL BEING AFFECTED A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN CRIMINAL CASES- THE AVERAGE DAYS A LAPSE FROM THE FILING TO DISPOSITION FOR CIVIL UNLIMITED CASE WHICH INCLUDES- THE COMPLEX CIVIL INCREASED BY ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AND THEN FINALLY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HEARINGS- PER CASE FOR CIVIL CRIMINAL AND TRAFFIC REALLY VARIED BASED ON LOCAL CONSTRAINTS AND PROCESS CHANGES SO IN SOME CASES THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS INCREASED. ARE SOME STAY THE SAME AND IN SOME CASES ARE THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS ACTUALLY DECREASE. BUT THAT'S A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF HOW THE COURTS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC- I'LL ASK- THIS NANCY EVERHART- TO COMMON ON OF THE DETAILS OPERATE EXAMPLE FROM WITH. THANK YOU MISTER YOUNG- YOUNG AND MATT CHAIRMAN OF THE- THIS NEW YOU EVER HEARD OF EXACT OFFICER SAM TO DINO SUPERIOR COURT AMONG CHAIR OF THE CORTEX. OF COMMITTEE AND MEMBER OF QUE. THE SURVEYS AND THAT I GATHER EXPERTS OF THE COURT IN A WAY WE CAN BE TO SEE COMMON TO. IT HEALTH SAFETY NEEDS SHALL ABOUT TO GO KOBE IMPACT IN THE UP. TO REMAIN. THE WORK OF THE COURT A FURTHER INTEREST YOU BESIDE THE TRIAL COURT SIR. IS A PANDA CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN TRIAL COURTS IT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. WE CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU RECEIVE THAT. BUT THE EMERGENCY ORDERS AUTHORIZED. AUTHORIZING MORE OPTIONS THE COURTS WERE ABLE TO EXPAND REMOTE ACCESS TO HEARINGS. REMOTE SELF HELP FARMS COMPLETION ELECTRONIC FILINGS DIGITAL EVIDENCE DOCUMENT ROUTING SIGNATURES AND EVEN INVESTIGATION DUTIES AROUND CONSERVATORSHIP GUARDIANSHIPS IN CHILD. SUPPORT AND ALSO VISITATION. WE'RE COMPLETING THAT OF K. FIRE HERE EACH DAY. IN LA WHERE SIX COURT HOWEVER MY TECH. UPWARDS OF THOUSAND CASES ARE HEARD REMOTE PER DAY. IN JANUARY TWENTY NINE THOUSAND LITIGANTS PARTICIPATED UNLIMITED CIVIL PROCEEDINGS. IN SAN DIEGO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY COURT ROOMS HAVE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY HEARING AROUND A THOUSAND CASES PER DAY. IN SANTA CLARA JUVENILE DEPENDENCY IS COMPLETELY REMOTE. IN CURRENT THEY PARTNERED WITH JUSTICE PARTNERS TO COLLABORATE AND MAKE REMOTE HEARINGS A REALITY WHERE IT WASN'T BEFORE. AN ORANGE COUNTY THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE CURRENT SMALL CLAIMS IN TRAFFIC MATTERS. MY COURTS AS WELL AS SANITARY LOS ANGELES AND OTHER COURTS HAVE PUSHED PUSHED FORWARD REMOTE SELF HELP OPTIONS. WE LAUNCHED A NEW DIGITAL ACCESS SELF HELP PLATFORM TO HELP SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS ACCESS FORMS WORKSHOPS LIVE CHAT VIEW FILES HAVE DOCUMENTS REVIEWED AND COMPLETED IS. THE BEGINNING OF OUR PROCESS HERE LOCALLY SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY USERS REGISTERED FOR ASSISTANCE. BY JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE WERE ADDED. THE TOTAL FOR MARCH THROUGH DECEMBER OF WITH AGAINST REACHED OUT FOR REMOTE ASSISTANCE. MANY COURTS ARE SHARING SIMILAR STORIES. CHIEF JUSTICE IS CHARGED TO SEARCH FOR A 310060 DEGREES ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES THIS HAPPENING NOW. THIS IS PAINFUL EXCEPT EXTENDABLE AND EXCITING AND A WAY FORWARD TO MODERNIZE. ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AS MR YOUNG MENTION HEALTH AND SEE IS OUR- YEAH SIGNIFICAN FACTOR. IN THE COURTS A BILL TO MAKE SERVICE LIKE ALL. THE TRIAL COURTS HAVE A- IMPLEMENTED MASK ORDER SO DISTANCING. SIGNAGE DELIVERY I TRIAGE. CALENDAR MAY. AND CLEAN TEMPERATURE IN HELPS. SEPARATE THIS BARRIERS SUCH AS PLEX. REMOTE WORK. SHIFTS MOVEMENT OF STAFF AND JUDGES JURIES CREATE. AND SPACE LET JUST OR EVEN IN ALL TURN FACILITIES. WE REALLOCATED STAFF RESOURCES. TO CODED BY PER MANAGEMENT PROMOTED PERRANCE MONITOR. EXPANDING CENTER. EXPANDING SERVICES NOTICING AND NOTICED BLUE HEARING AS NEW HEALTH OR AND CLOSE WERE WERE OUT EACH DAY. MANY OF OUR STAFF HAVE BECOME TRACERS AND IMPLEMENT NEW LAW AND- AROUND EXPO NOTED. CHORDS EVERY L. STAY TO WORK TIME I WEEKEND. PROVIDING TRACING ARE ALSO LEE A SYSTEM IS AN- FOR EXAMPLE IN LA NICE TO OF BEING REAL. TO WORKERS CONTACT RAY AND COUNTY SIX SANDY FIVE EXEMPTS DINO FOR. ADDING AND SAFETY MEASURES COME A HUGE MONEY AND RESOURCE FOR. COST COURTS AND WE HAVE TO DIVERSIFY FROM A UP. AT MY COURT ENHANCE YOUR- IS TH EXTRA MONTH. IN L. THE COST IS OVER FIVE MILLION TO. DIMINISHED ACCESS THE COURT AND BACK ARE RESULT OF MANY FOR. STEPHAN JUDGES HAVE NOT BEEN OF TO WORK DUE TO. CO REASON SCORE WITH. SCHOOL AND DAY CARE CLOSURES. AND SOME STAFF AND JUDGES HAVE HAD TO RETIRE QUIT THERE ARE NO OTHER ON. IN OTHER OF TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE THE BIG HOLIDAY SURGE FORTY SEVEN COURTS REPORTED LOST AFTER DAYS IN A- CORE REPORTER LAST YEAR NETWORK. AT HIGH POINT IN THE SUMMER MY COURT A HIGH OF THIRTY BECAUSE OF CASES WITH ONE HUNDRED. AT WEDNESDAY WE ALSO HAVE ONE COURT CLOSURE. NORINCHUKIN ONE CAN RESULT IN FORTY CONTRACTORS SAYING INVESTIGATIONS. IN SANTA CLARA AND ENTIRE DEPARTMENT WAS QUARANTINE BACKING UP WORK IN THAT CASE TYPE FOR OVER TWO WEEKS. LA IS REPORTING SIMILAR ISSUES. OUR ARE EGGS. DELAYS BE SEEN AND BY. TIME TO TELEPHONE WAY TIMES. ACCESSING FILES HOST OF OTHER CORE FUNCTIONS. RESOURCE A STRETCH FURTHER SEVERE COURT BUDGET READ THE SPECIFICALLY. CALENDARS ARE REDUCED 22225% OF AVERAGE CAPACITY DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE TYPICAL COURT ROOM SHOULD HOLD FIFTY PEOPLE. WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING ELEVEN PEOPLE IS THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY INCLUDING JUDGES AND STAFF SOME OF OUR OLDER COURT ROOMS REALLY ONLY FIFTY FIVE. MANDATORY IN PERSON HEARINGS IN JURY TRIALS HAVE SLOWED AND CALENDARS MUST FREQUENTLY BE CONTINUED- AS MR YOUNG REPORTED OUR CONTINUANCE IS HIGH IN MANY CASE TYPES AND JUROR CHAU RIGHTS ARE PURPLE CHAU ARE. CURRENTLY I HAVE 11% SHOW RATE FOR JURORS IT USED TO BE ABOUT 30% REMOTE PROCEEDINGS HAVE HELP BRING MATTERS FORWARD AUTHORIZED BUT THEIR STAFF AND TIME INTENSIVE- PURCHASING AND CONTRACTING FOR SERVICES INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT TRAINING REMOTE MONITORS. SETTING UP CALENDARS QUALITY OF CONNECTION AND USER KNOWLEDGE ARE ALL CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE MEETING. THE COURTS AS A WHOLE HAVE PERFORMED HEROICALLY TO SHIFTING RESHEF CORE FUNCTIONS YOUR ADDRESS MULTIPLE CHALLENGES SINCE THE ONSET OF CO THAT NINETEEN. WE HAVE REINVENTED AND MAINTAIN ACCESS AS CO THAN A BUDGET CHALLENGES HAVE ALLOWED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROPOSED RESTORATION OF BUDGET GIVES US ALL HOPE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH NEW INNOVATION TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR THE PROPOSED BUDGET THANK YOU. AND THEN- JUDGE PRIMARY IS ALSO ON THE LINE JUST HUNDRED DID YOU. TO PROVIDE A JUDICIAL AUTHORITY FOR. ON PANDEMIC. CERTAINLY I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS- AS WE PRESIDING JUDGES ON FOR SOMEONE TO SAY YOU MADAM MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I AM A JEW HEINRICH I AM I IN HUMBOLDT ON THE JUDGE THERE I'M CHAIR OF THE TRIAL COURT- RESIDING ADVISORY AND I'M ALSO IN ADVISORY OF THE COUNT- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY ALLOW TO SPEAK- THE COMMENT I WAS GONNA MAKE WHEN HE TO MISS EVERHART A IS THAT PROVIDING RELY A LOT OBVIOUSLY ON THE- IS OFFICERS TO DO THE BOTH OF THAT DAY TODAY. ADMINISTRATION OF COURT JUDGES I WANT ADD ALSO WORKED HARD THE PAN AM LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES TO BE ABLE TO DO APPEARANCES UP HITTING AS QUICKLY AS WERE ABLE TO THERE'S A REAL- COURT IS- CONSIDER A SMALL MEDIUM- AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE- EVEN HOLD A COURT OPEN BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF STAFF IT'S GOING TO- IN MATTERS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE TO GET THINGS CA. AT THE ONE THING THOUGH THAT WE HAVE- HARD TO PROVIDE A TO WE- CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO IN THE PAST IT TAKES LONGER AND WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF THE SAFETY OF OUR PUBLIC AND OTHERS AS. WELL- WE ARE. WHAT DILIGENTLY TO THOSE RELYING. THAT TAKE PLACE. I COURSE WERE A TO. GEAR UP AT THE RATES BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY MAY ALREADY HAD IN PLACE- BUT ALL. A TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS REMOTELY. I THINK THE BACKLOG THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING IS A HARD TO KEEP. EXACTLY AND I ON. OUR BECAUSE OF FOR EXAMPLE THE CHIEF JUSTICES- A PUSH TO DEAL WITH CRIMINAL BACKLOG IS GOING TO BE OF ASSISTANCE S IT AT WE CAN GET IN. AND IN PLACE- CIVIL BACKLOG WERE ABLE TO DO A OF SAID. MATTERS REMOTE HOWEVER CIVIL JURY TRIALS OBVIOUSLY HAVE- ARE AFTER CRIMINAL JURY TRIALS AND THEY TAKE MUCH LONGER. TO DO. IN ADDITION- PART OF WHAT I THINK THE CHIEFS EFFORT OF HAVING SETTLEMENT I'M MORE INTENSE SETTLEMENTS IS IT OFTENTIMES JURY TRIALS DON'T SETTLE UNTIL THEY KNOW THERE'S A JURY TRIAL AND THEN IT WE ARE SCHEDULED. AND WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO THAT IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION- AND THOUGH WE HAVE FOUND- THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MATTERS THAT CAN BE HELD REMOTELY I THINK THAT WE- ARE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC. AT EITHER CONTINUE REMOTELY OR IN SOME HYBRID MANNER AND THEN OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT WHAT IS MOST. CRITICAL TO HAVE FOLKS IN THE COURT ROOM. AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. SO UNLESS THERE ARE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE COMMENTS THAT- MR YOUNG AND MR EVERHART MADE AND THAT. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY EVERY DAY TO- TRY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU WILL LOVE THIS FINANCE WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. ZERO NINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON E. THIRTY FUNDING THE TRIAL TO PROCESS UNLAWFUL TO. YOU THE PASSAGE OF NINETY ONE REAR WITH STRONGER. FOR EIGHTY EIGHT PRIMARILY ACTION INSTEAD BE WORK WITH THAT YOU CAL. OVER THE COMING IT'S THE OF ASKING NINE ONE ON THE TRAVEL IN POTENTIALLY SOME APPLY PRICKLES FOR BY RESOURCES LATER THIS SPRING. AS FOR THE JUDICIAL GENERAL FUND RESTORATION THE IMMEDIATE ACT PACKAGING AN AGREEMENT TO READ THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR UNDER RIGHT BACK. THE JUDICIAL STYLE INCLUDE IN THE TWO BUDGET. SPECIFIC THAT SPECIFICALLY ON SEVENTY POINT NINE MILLION WILL RESTORED THE TRIAL. IN TWENTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION WILL BE RESTORED TO THE STATE WOULD YOU SAY BEGIN IN TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWO IN OUR GOING THE USUAL IN USED. FUNDS TO ME THEIR CHANGING OPERATION AND PROGRAM. ANALYSTS ACCESS- SO WE HAVE SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS THAT WOULD APPLY TO THIS ISSUE I AM AS WELL AS- THE- RATIONS OF THE OTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. AND SIMPLE FOR YOU YOU REALLY HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS WHICH MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME AS A LEGISLATURE IS AND SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIAL COURT FUNDING LEVELS AND ALLOCATIONS. REALLY ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR THE LEVELS OF SERVICES AND DESIRES WHICH CAN INCLUDE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS OR ACCEPTABLE LENGTH OF DELAYS AS WELL AS EQUITY. AND SO WHEN ENSURING THAT THESE FUNDING LEVELS AND SERVICE LEVELS MATCH THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE JUST GENERALLY RELATIVE TO ITS OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES AND THE STATE'S OVERALL PHYSICAL CONDITION. AS WELL AS HOW THE FUNDING SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AND HOW MUCH DISCRETION TO PROVIDE THE TRIAL COURTS OVER THE USE OF THE FUNDING SO TO GIVE YOU A REALLY QUICK EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVES AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO PREVENT FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE LEVELS ARE GROSSLY PADLOCK- THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDIRECT ON A ONE TIME OR ONGOING BASIS SOME OF THE MONEY THAT. IS BEING PROPOSED FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERING LATER TODAY. OR BECAUSE SATISFIED FUNDING STORE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES SUCH AS TO ADDRESS PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING USED. FOR THAT PURPOSE I THINK LAKE- IN LINE WITH THAT THERE THEY'RE KIND OF. THINGS THAT WE ARE WANTED TO FOR ALEXIS CONSIDERATION- AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REFERENCED- JUST YESTERDAY A COUPLE DAYS AGO THERE'S A THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH RESTORING A REDUCTION THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. AND SO F YOU LOOK ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR AGENDA JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDED SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION ONGOING GENERAL CLASS. THAT RESTORATION IS APPROVED AT SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT AND SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON- IN IMPROVING SERVICE LEVELS. AND THAT THAT RESTORATION IS NOT APPROVED AND IT'S JUST A SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION WE WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT JUST THAT MONEY WOULD NOT LIKELY. IMPACT SERVICE LEVELS SUBSTANTIALLY AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. USUAL BRANCH THE TRIAL COURT SPECIFICALLY RECEIVED A ONE TIME FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR OFFSET AND WITH THAT EXPLORATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF THE TRIAL COURTS WOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION TO IMPLEMENT IT. AS A LARGE SHARE OF THE SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION WOULD LIKELY HAVE GONE TO AVOID FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES. AND AGAIN THIS IS ABSENCE YOU KNOW THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION THAT WAS RECENTLY AT RETAIL- THE SECOND THAT WE WANTED TO FIND FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO CHANGE STATE LAW. TO PROVIDE ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE TRIAL COURT'S DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY'RE CURRENTLY- DOING SOME OF THESE UNDER EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION- FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF VIDEO CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY. AND SOME OF THESE THINGS CAN HAVE- YOU KNOW CAN HELP THE COURTS OPERATE MORE COST EFFECTIVELY BUT ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO COURT SERVICES AND SO THE% LEGISLATION MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE. MIGHT WANT TO DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THEM. AND THE THIRD AND FINAL THING OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TALKED A LOT ABOUT KIND OF THE INCREASED COSTS AND IMPACTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. THE THING THAT WE DID ONE OF LACK OF THE LEGISLATURE IS AT THE TOP THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ARE LIKELY TO IMPACT SERVICE LEVELS. EVEN BEYOND THE BUDGET YEAR DESPITE EFFORTS TO KIND OF MINUTE MITIGATE OR OR MINIMIZE THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE JURY TRIALS YOU'RE LIKELY TO STILL HAVE BACKLOGS IN THOSE AREAS AS WE ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT THEM IN A SAFE PUBLICLY YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH- PERMISSIBLE MANNER. AND UNCLEAR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR US TO RETURN TO NORMAL PROCESSING TIMES AS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT. OR MINIMIZE THOSE LONGER TERM IMPACTS SUCH AS PROVIDING FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE OR STAFF TO CONDUCT JURY TRIALS IN A SAFE MANNER SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE WILL OFFER TO THE LEGISLATURE. FOR KIND OF THEIR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ABOUT ONE WOULD BE WHAT WOULD BE. I DON'T MEAN PIE IN THE SKY BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO RESTORE COURT OPERATIONS TO PREPEND THE MAKE LEVELS AND WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF NEED. I DON'T KNOW IF THE- MISTER YOUNG YEAH SO THIS IS THE ROBERT A YOUNG I AM I CAN ANSWER THAT IN TERMS OF- RESTORATION- I THINK THAT CHIEF JUSTICE REALLY SUPPORTS PRIOR BUDGET CUT RESTORATION- SHOULD THE STATE REVENUES CONDITIONS IMPROVED- IN TERMS OF. THE PRIORITIES THE COURTS HAVE REALLY TAKEN AN INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC ACTIONS. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC THAT HAVE AFFECTED THEM LOCALLY SO IN SOME CASES SOME COURTS HAVE HAD TO REDUCE OUR STAFFING SOME HAVE HAD TO HAVE- FURLOUGHS OTHERS HAVE DELAYED- INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND SO THERE IS NOT ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF PRIORITY WHERE THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT IT'S REALLY DEPENDENTUPON EACH INDIVIDUAL COURT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ADJUSTED AND PIVOTED. TO ADDRESS THEIR LOCAL CONSTRAINTS ARE IN THEIR COUNTY AND SO THAT WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF OUR STAFFING AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND INVESTMENTS. HI NANCY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ADDITIONS YOU'D LIKE TO- BATTERED WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WOULD AGREE WITH MR YOUNG OF MANY COURTS HAVE TO REDUCE IN DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON- IF THEY HAD A TWO OR 3% RESERVE AVAILABLE TO. KIND OF PRESENT A GLIDE PATH- MANY COURTS HAVE TO FURLOUGH OR LAYOFFS OR CREATE THEY CAN SEIZE AND ALSO DIFFER MANY PROJECTS- SO THAT WOULD BE A PRIORITIZATION TO GET US BACK TO PRE COATED. TIMES SO THERE AREN'T ANY PARTICULAR UNIVERSAL- ACROSS THE BOARD- AREAS OF NEED. OUR LIST OF THE LOCAL CONDITIONS OR IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL CONDITIONS MADAM CHAIR- A COMMON THEME IS REDUCTION IN STAFFING. AND- AND FURLOUGHS. BUT NOT IN A PARTICULAR SERVICE. NOT IN A PARTICULAR AREA I'M PARTICULAR- THE WITH REGARD TO THE BACKLOG BACKLOG- DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SO WE COULD UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE ISSUE. SO IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOGS- BACKLOG CAN BE MEASURED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS R. AND WHEN THE- JUDICIAL OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP- ALLEVIATE THE BACKLOGS THE TRIAL COURT BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BUDGET- COMMITTEE. ARM CAME TOGETHER TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A MODEL FOR QUANTIFYING BACKLOGS ACROSS THE BRANCH AND SO WHAT THEY DID. WAS THEY LOOKED AT THE CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS BETWEEN PRE VET PANDEMIC TIMES TO PANDEMIC ARE. AND WHAT THEY DID- NOTICED- PLEASE FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE DATE OF DISPOSITION- WE FALL THAT ON AVERAGE- COURTS EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN ABOUT 45% ARE IN THE NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS THAT THEY WERE- ABLE TO PROCESS- DURING THE PANDEMIC- THAT ALSO IS REFLECTIVE OF- NEED THAT ALSO YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. DURING THAT TIME- THE NUMBER OF FILINGS- HAVE REDUCED AS WELL- HOWEVER THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS IN TERMS OF THE AGAIN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DISPOSITION BEING PROCESS REDUCED BY ABOUT FRTY FIVE PERCENT- AVERAGE NUMBER OF FILINGS REDUCE DURING THAT PANDEMIC TIME- RANGED ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ON AVERAGE AGAIN THAT WAS ANYWHERE BETWEEN ABOUT. 20% OR SO- SO THAT WAS YOU KNOW THIS NEXT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS ARE THAT THE COURTS COULD PROCESS AND THAT WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR MEASURING- THE BACKLOG IN VARIOUS AREAS. OKAY- THAT'S IT FOR ME I'M SORRY I DIDN'T M. WELCOME CENTER GROVE TO THE COMMITTEE. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE- ALEX ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME ALL. YEAH OKAY SIR CRITICIZING. OKAY IN THE CENTER GROVE. I THANK YOU VERYMUCH OF FOR. REVIEW OVERVIEW- APOLOGIZE FOR COMING IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES LATER THINK- FOR THE OVERALL PRESENTATION- DUE TO SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON- FOR ME BUT THAT DOES SAID I HAVE- A COLUMN IN A SPECIFIC QUESTION ON ONE OF THE ITEMS A COMMENT IS. IS JUST THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL HEARING THIS OVERVIEW- POORLY IN IN CERTAINLY I'VE MY STAFF AND I HAVE A BROKEN DOWN TODAY'S PACKET BUT GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO. ALMOST CREATED A CHART OR SPREADSHEET THAT DEALS WITH THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS- SO WHAT YOU JUST ASKED MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU- WITH REGARD TO IN IN SOME OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM. THE LAST TESTIMONY- WHAT WHAT IS- BASELINE TO WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BRING JUST BASELINE ONGOING FUNDING BACK WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO DEAL WITH THE ONE TIME THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE L. L. A. O.'S OFFICE AND I MADE MY OWN NOTES BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S IN AND OF ITSELF- SORT OF A DEBIT AND A CREDIT SO TO SPEAK THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR GOING FORWARD I THINK. AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S IN MY MIND- BACKLOG ISSUES WHICH- WE ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING I MEAN IN THE SENSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE BACKLOG THEN FALL BACK AGAIN BUT. YOU KNOW LADIES. IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF YOU TAKE IF YOU INVESTIGATING THE BACKLOG CAUGHT UP THE NEW AT SOME POINT YOU CAN RETURN BACK TO BASELINE FUNDING GOING FORWARD AND I JUST THINK THOSE ARE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. THAT IT WOULD HELP ME MAYBE I'M JUST A VISUAL PERSON TO JUST SEE THOSE CHARTED OUT- MUCH MUCH LIKE THE- THE SPEAKERS WERE WERE TRYING TO. I THINK WORLEY CONCERT THRILLED THAT OUT FOR US TODAY MY SPECIFIC QUESTION. HAS TO DO WITH IT ON PAGE THREE ITEM THREE THE ELEVEN POINT SEVEN. MILLION DOLLARS. A TO PROTEST PROCESS ANTICIPATED INCREASE UNLAWFUL DETAINER SMALL CLAIMS FILINGS RESULT FOR MAYBE THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT AND I HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR AND IN I KNEW BEFORE I CAME IN TODAY THAT- FROM READING THE PACKAGE THAT THAT WAS WITHDRAWN BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR RE EVALUATION IN A TO- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ASSUME SB NINETY ONE AND- THE EXTENSION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE I'VE SPOKEN OUT. A LITTLE BIT ON. IS MY BELIEF THAT- IN ADDITION. TO- ANTICIPATED INCREASE INCREASES IN UT'S AT SOME POINT WAS A MORATORIUM IS OVER THAT. HE IN IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THAT IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE ESSENTIALLY THE- WHAT COULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHAOS WERE JUST. TRAUMA TO BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS SAID WE NEED SOME SORT OF MEDIATION SERVICES- WE NEED LEGAL AID SERVICES MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN TO THAT- IN IN BUDGET HEARINGS ARE ON THE FOR THE SENATE- BUT MEDIATION. SERVICES OR AUGMENTATION TO EXISTING SERVICES I KNOW THE COURTS- YOU KNOW I GUESS DEPENDING ON ON WHICH COUNTY PROVIDE THAT INSTITUTIONALLY TO SOME EXTENT IN AGAIN AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR I KNOW THAT SOME COUNTIES LIKE SANTA CLARA- HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS IN SOME CITIES LIKE SAN JOSE HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. EITHER SPECIFICALLY TO DEAL WITH LANDLORD TENANT MEDIATION IN HARDSHIP FOR. NEIGHBORHOOD MEDIATION PROGRAMS LIKE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT ARE SORT OF INTENDED TO HEAD OFF- DISPUTES THAT MIGHT OTHER OTHERWISE AND UP- IT IN THE COURT SYSTEM. SO. I WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROPOSE- IN CERTAINLY PASSES ALONG TO THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS SOME SORT OF ADDITIONAL BUG BUDGET AUGMENTATION IS TO IS TO DEAL WITH THAT NOW- AS SOON AS WE CAN IN ADVANCE OF NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE OF THE ALTAR EVENTUAL EXPIRATION OF THE- OF THE MORATORIUM. BUT ANTICIPATION OF THE ROLL OUT OF FEDERAL AID IT IS GOING TO PUT A LOT OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS I THINK IN A SITUATION OF. PARTIAL SATISFACTION- IN I DON'T KNOW IF- THE AGENTS ON THE CALL WOULD AGREE- TODAY BUT I THINK PARTIAL SATISFACTION IS OFTEN- RECIPE FOR ONGOING DISPUTES- THAT EITHER NEED TO BE ADJUDICATOR MEDIA THAT SAID I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR BACK. ANY RESPONSE TO THAT WE HAVE TIME THIS THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT ON TODAY IF I'M OFF OR WRONG- I SHOULD PROBABLY HEAR THAT TODAY THE PRETTY GREEN TERMS OF. THE NEED FOR ANY ANY AUGMENTATION OF MEDIATION SERVICES SOON SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WITH. YES OR NO ON THAT IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN- I'LL JUST JUMP AHEAD AND SAID LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT TO FUTURE COMMITTEE OPTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YEAH THANK YOU AND I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE JUDGES COULD RESPOND TO THAT PROBABLY FIRSTHAND FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE- WHERE THEY SAID BUT ALSO I SUPPOSE FINANCE BUT ALL. OF THE FOR THE US ADJOURNMENT. BINANCE OKAY ONLY SIX REMINDS REMINDS YES. HELLO AND I JUST WANTED TO WRITE A BRIEF BACKGROUND OF LEGAL AID SERVICES CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS THE LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR RENTERS AND HOME OWNERS THE FIRST IS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THE CENTER EXPECTED ME SPENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE SECOND PART OF FUNDING IS THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WAS INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S IN PROCESS OF FINALIZING GRANT AGREEMENT AND EXPECTS TO HAPPEN SPEND ALLOCATED SERVICE PROVIDERS THIS MONTH EVEN THAT FUNDING IS JUST NOW GOING OUT TO SERVICE PROVIDERS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NOT BEING AT ALLOCATED AT THIS TIME HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT EDITION RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND JUNIORS WE CAN ALWAYS CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE- HOWEVER SPEAKING TO THE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACT ON CAPITAL FOR TO THE JUDICIAL-COUNCIL WHERE THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON. YOUR QUESTION IS HOW IT RELATES. TO THE MEDIATION IT CAN I JUST IT BEFORE WE- THE LOSES SPEAKERS I MAY NOT. HERE TO THIS IDOL ITS BUSINESS AMMAN IS A YOUR NAME- ANYWAY LET ME JUST. IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN I SPEAK TO MEDIATION SERVICES THAT IS. IT WILL BE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT. A GRANT ELIGIBILITY WOULD INCLUDE NOT JUST LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO TENANTS- SO THEY HAVE AFFECTED ASSISTANCE FOR COUNCIL BUT ALSO MEDIATION SERVICES CAN COME FROM ONE OF THOSE TWO PARTS ARE BOTH. IT'S BEEN TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER TO FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. STARTING IN OUR DISTRICT- THIS WOULD INCLUDE MEDIATION SERVICES ABOUT HAPPINESS FOR THE FUTURE COUNCIL TO SPEAK UP SPEAK MORE CLEARLY TO TWO YEAR SESSION MY APOLOGIES NO PROBLEM THANK YOU. OKAY CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAMCHAIR YEAH I'M SORRY WHAT IS- OKAY I'M SORRY AM I GONNA GET USED TO THIS- YES MISTER T. V- DROVE IT. YES I WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE PROGRAM EXPERTS- CHARLIE INDUCTOR IN MONEY HOUSE WHO CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPOND TO SENATORS QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CURRENT USAGE OF FUNDS AND HOW THEY'RE ALLOCATED- TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND SELF AND IF YOU HAVE THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS DEFINITELY HOUSE. MISTER HERE AND HEALTH. PROVIDE THAT INPUT. OKAY SO. SHOULD WE DO THAT AT A FUTURE. TO DO THAT AT A FUTURE HEARING OR DO WE WANT TO. GET SOME OF THAT MEASURE- AND NO I KNOW THE SPEED ONGOING DISCUSSION I WOULD BE SATISFIED IF. OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT WERE JUST IDENTIFIED COULD REACH OUT TO THE COMMITTEE OFFICES ARE THE TO OUR OFFICES- DEPENDING ON- MY COLLEAGUES METER APPETITE FOR THAT INFORMATION I KNOW I KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND- IN SPECIFICALLY IN IN CASE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. AT SOME POINT BEFORE THE END OF THIS CRISIS- A SUGGESTS AUGMENTATION OR SUGGEST ANY KIND OF CLARITY OR CLARIFICATION ON- MAKING THAT GRANT PROGRAM- APPROPRIATELY SIZED- MAKING SURE IT IS ALREADY SO I MAYBE WE CAN HELD THAT WAY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO TIE EVERYONE UP WITH. THE ANSWER MY QUESTION BUT RIGHT BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED- OKAY THANK WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. CENTER GROVE. I'M THINKING MADAM CHAIR IT'S DEFINITELY PLEASURE TO JOIN YOU THIS IS MY FIRST COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- I DID WALK IN A LITTLE BIT LATE I DO APOLOGIZE AND I WAS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS PRESENTED ON THE OVERALL VIEW AND- I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD THE ANSWER TO THAT SHARES QUESTION I HAD THE SAME KIND OF QUESTION- I'LL JUST REPEAT WHICH HE SAID NOT PIE IN THE SKY BET- WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT THE COURT AND THE- BRANCH SEES IT WILL BE- FIT TO RESTORE COURTS. TO WHERE THEY WERE PRE PANDEMIC I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- BUDGET REQUEST AFTER THE RESTORATION WHAT WAS TAKEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IS THAT SUFFICIENT OR EXERT MORE IN THAT ASK AND OR IS IT SUFFICIENT OR DO YOU FIND AT THE BRANCH AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND LOCALS A STILL FEEL SHORT CHANGED. WALKER WOULD YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. CERTAINLY NO- WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT THE RESTORATION AND FEEL THAT THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL INVESTMENT AT THIS TIME AS WE ARE EVALUATING IN GOING FORWARD I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT'S BEEN- YOU KNOW DELIVERED ALONG WITH THE RESTORATION IS THE NOTION THAT THE TRUCKS WERE USING- THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC IT IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN THE PROCEDURES- TO FACILITATE AS MANY TRANS. MANY AT PORT OPERATIONS AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO THE- THERE'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE JUST BEEN RELEASED- YESTERDAY AND SPEAKS TO- THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE SEVERAL AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES THERE SO WE THINK AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO OBVIOUSLY BE EVALUATING THE WATER NEEDS ARE BUT AS FAR AS THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE THINK THAT THAT IS A IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT FOR SUPPORTIVE OF THAT ON. IN THE BUDGET. GOING FORWARD. SO A JUST TOOK A THAT THE THINGS THAT EVEN LIKE THE U. OF TECH. AND VIDEO CONFERENCING AND THE ASSISTANT- I GUESS WE'D COLUMN KIOSK IS PRETTY SIMPLE THE SELF HELP ASSISTED KIOSK TYPE OF. FACILITIES THAT WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE ON THE COURT TO HELP OTHERS IT STREAMLINED THE COURT PROCESS. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO- CONFIRM THAT THE TUNER MILLION DOLLAR RESTORATION WAS TAKEN YOU KNOW IN PRIOR YEARS IT ONCE IT'S RESTORED DO YOU THINK THAT ADDRESSES THE BACKLOG OF WORK AS WELL OR IS THAT A SEPARATE ISSUE. I WOULD DISCARDED TURNED TO STRUGGLE IN TERMS OF- THE OPERATIONAL. CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITY BUT AGAIN. WAS WAS SUPPORT OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THE MIX OF SIGNIFICANT. IMPROVEMENT IN THE OPERATION WHAT'S- THANK YOU SIR. YEAH I THINK THAT AS YOUNG- MS EVER HARD HAD HAD MENTIONED- THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO. RESTORE BACK TO NORMAL I THINK THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS REALLY GOING TO HELP ESPECIALLY AS AGAIN AS EVERHART HAD MENTIONED THERE IS A- SEVERE- LACK OF RESOURCES I THINK THAT WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD. THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT WE I HAVE IMPLEMENTED WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE THAT REPLACING- SERVICES GOING FORWARD WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT- AS A ADDITIONAL. ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC AND SO WE SEE THAT THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF REMOTE SERVICES SOME OF THE KIOSK. WE THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE COURTS IN THAT MANNER AND SO THOSE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE FORWARD AND AGAIN THE RESTORATION OF THE MONEY WILL WILL DEFINITELY HELP- WITH THE BACKLOGS BUT WE WOULD NEED TO- SEE THE PROGRESS AS WE- IMPLEMENT THOSE CHANGES OVER TIME. THANK YOU SIR I I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE ITEMS. WE'RE NOT LOADING TODAY SENATOR GROVE- THESE ARE BEING HELD OPEN. SO TO DATE NONE OF THESE ITEMS WILL BE VOTED ON. HOLDING THEM OPEN. WE ANNOUNCES THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY- IN NOTHING NOTHING ELSE OKAY SO THIS IS A HOLD OPEN LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO A CONTINUATION OF SELF HELP CENTERS AND TRIAL COURT- THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PLEASE. YES SIR MADAM CHAIR AND JUSTIN BRIEFS- IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR THERE WAS A NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION ONE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE MUCH NEEDED SELF HELP CENTER FUNDING THAT WAS APPROVED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS BUDGET IS NOT PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT FUNDING I'M ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO MAINTAIN VITAL SOUTH OF SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ACCESS FOR LITIGANTS YEAH I HAVE ATTORNEYS TO HELP THEM WITH HOUSING NOTHING VIOLENCE FAMILY LAW CHILD SUPPORT CONSUMER DEBT AND SIMILAR ISSUES ALL OF WHICH ARE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC- WE DO HAVE AGAIN THE- CHARLENE DOCTOR AND BONNIE HOUSE WHO ARE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE IN ONE OR MORE INDEFINITELY AND RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ABOUT THE- PROPOSED ONGOING FUNDING ON AT THE CURRENT. LEVELS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET. OKAY SO- WILL FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YES YOU KNOW MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW LA US CONCERNS FOR THIS PROPOSAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN ITS INVESTMENT- SELF HELP CENTERS BEYOND THAT YOU YEARS. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE L. A. L. BECAUSE THERE'S AN ONGOING WORKLOAD FOR SOFTBALL TENNIS TO ADDRESS ANOTHER COST BENEFIT STUDY MAKE IT BENEFICIAL TO ASSESS THE MONETARY VALUE OF SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THESE RESOURCES SUPPORT THE ASSISTANCE OF OVER ONE MILLION SELF REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS A YEAR SO I'M GOING TO ONGOING FUNDING WOULD BE IS NECESSARY. WITHOUT SOMETHING WE CONTINUED ONGOING TRIAL COURTS MAY BE FORCED TO REDUCE SERVICE LEVELS FOR CRITICAL SOME TOP ISSUES I JUST CRITICAL HOUSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FAMILY WALL ON IT OTHER ISSUES WHICH HAVE ONLY ESCALATED SINCE THE ONSET OF THE INTERNET. IN THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THE NINETEEN MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE NEED FOR SELF HELP CENTERS BEYOND THE CHEERS IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENT VISUAL CONTACT IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE L. A. L. YOU KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE STUDY SINCE THIS WOULD BE. A NEW WORK WELL FOR THEM TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER- L. PLEASE. ANY DALY THE WITH THE A. L. SO WE HAVE THREE RECOMMEND ON THIS I- SO. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION DIRECTING JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO CONTRACT WITH AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER TO COMPLETE THE COSTBENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THE LEGISLATURE ASKED FOR A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS- AS PART OF. THE PACKAGE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR- THREE YEARS- WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THIS EXTERNAL CONTRACTOR PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE FUNDING COULD BE ALLOCATED BY DELIVERY METHOD AND CASE TYPE TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND TO THE COURT. THE REPORT THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SUBMITTED EARLIER THIS MONTH HOW DO A LOT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AND INCLUDED- EXTENSIVE STAFF EFFORT AND COLLECTED OUTCOME DATA BUT IT IS MISSING THE KEY PIECES OF A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WHICH IS CALCULATING THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE IDENTIFIED BENEFITS IDENTIFYING THE CORRESPONDING COSTS AND IDENTIFYING THE NET BENEFIT OF THE VARIOUS SELF HELP DELIVERY METHODS- AND SO WE VIEW OUR RECOMMENDATION AS- COMPLETING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED AND WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING IS WARRANTED AND HOW THAT FUNDING SHOULD BE USED TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT WHAT DO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THAT REPORT% BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY IN ORDER TO INFORM LEGISLATIVE BUDGET DECISIONS AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IN LINE WITH THIS YOU DATE IS THAT WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ONLY PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDING FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS THIS. PREVENTS THE REDUCTION IN SERVICE AND HELPS MAINTAIN ALL OF THE EQUITY RELATED BENEFITS THAT COMES FROM THESE RESOURCES BUT THAT IS UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVES THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. TO THEN INFORM THEIR JUST ASIANS MOVING. AND SO THAT IS HOW THE ALLOW. AND THE INFORMATION WILL WOULD BE HELPFUL. OUR LAST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT. EXCUSE ME THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADOPTING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO SPECIFY ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF THE SELF HELP CENTER FUNDING. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SPECIFYING THAT A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY SO CURRENTLY WE HEARD FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT'S AWFUL SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED REMOTELY- BECAUSE- ACCESS TO THE COURT HOUSES ARE RESTRICTED. BUT THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAVE BENEFIT JUST ON AN ONGOING BASIS- UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR DISTANCES TO KIND OF VISIT THE COURTS TO RECEIVE. THESE SERVICES OTHERWISE IN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PRIORITIZE USES OF THESE DOLLARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- SELF HELP CENTERS- OF THE HOW WITH A SELF HELP CENTERS ADDRESSING THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES FROM. LITIGANTS LIVING IN AREAS WITH LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS. AND OR- WAR NOT LITERATE IN TECHNOLOGY- I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT- I AM A BONNIE HUFF AND I WORK FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE HONOR TO WORK- ON THE SPACIOUS- CENTERS TO THIS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS- FIRST OF ALL. MANY OF THE REMOTE SERVICES ARE OFFERED BY TELEPHONE WHICH MOST PEOPLE DO HAVE ACCESS TO AND SOME COURTS ARE USING TEXTING EMAIL ANOTHER COMMON SERVICES. BOB WELL AS WE'RE EXPANDING INTO VIDEO CONFERENCING AND OTHER WAYS TO ALLOW OF FOLKS TO HAVE MORE OF A FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION WORK REVIEW PAPERWORK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A- A GROUP OF TWENTY TWO PORTS IN THE ROLE COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE BANDED TOGETHER AND SO SOMEBODY pCAN GO TO ONE OF THOSE SPORTS AND BE CONNECTED WITH- A OF. ANY ERA COURT WITHIN THAT- THAT COMMUNITY OF FIVE. OF SERVICES- THEN THAT ALLOWS FOR VIDEO CONFERENCING. TECHNOLOGY ALL KINDS OF SERVICE AS UP ANOTHER UP ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS LOS ANGELES WHERE THEY'RE OFFERING WORKSHOPS BY WEBEX BUT IF A LITIGANT DOES NOT HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY THEY CAN COME TO COURT. AND WATCHING A WORKSHOP ROOM. IN A SOCIALLY DISTANCE MANNER. IN OTHER CIRCLE WITH AGENCIES IN THERE CAN. TO SET UP COMPUTERS IN PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS LIBRARIES AND COMMUNITY CENTERS- THIS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO. GET ACCESS FROM SELF HELP CENTERS WITHOUT ME TO COURT AND I DO THINK- AS AS MISLEAD SUGGESTED I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING. I'M PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS SOME REAL CHALLENGES CONTESTANTS AND THESE ALL STARTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT- THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT WORK THAT THE SELF HLP CENTERS OF DOWN HAVE REALLY PAID OFF IN MANY WAYS. TO ENABLE US TO PROVIDE NEARLY THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES THAT WE- EVEN BEAT THAT WE. WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I AT EXAM IN FRESNO THE COURT HAS PLACED COMPUTERS AT LEAST STATIONS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTY. AND SO THAT ALLOWS THE COURT BASED ATTORNEY NEEDS TO HAVE VIDEO CONFERENCE MEETINGS WITH LITIGANTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE COURTHOUSE. AND ALLOWS THE SELF HELP STAFF AND WOOD AGAINST TO SEE THE SAME SCREEN. SO THE SELF HELP CENTER CAN HELP WITH AGAINST EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE. I'M OKAY WELL- I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER- I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S A AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO- SOME OF US HAVE BECOME SO. USED TO HAVING THE TECHNOLOGY HAVING THE DEVICES HAVING THE CONNECTIVITY. THAT IT JUST SEEMS SO SIMPLE- BUT IN REALITY FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE SEEN THAT NOW WITH SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED AND- ALL. WHO GETS IMPACTED THE WORST BY THAT ARE- POOR COMMUNITIES- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THAT DON'T HAVE THAT CONNECTIVITY EITHER THEY FOR THE KIDS DON'T OR THE PARENTS DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT SO. I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD JUST JUMP ON AND SAY. GREAT TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT EASIER- AND IN SOME WAYS IS GREAT UP BUT WE'RE STILL LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND AND- WE SHOULD BE VERY. COGNIZANT OF THAT. AND PUT THAT INFORMATION ON THE TABLE AS MUCH AS ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT COME FROM TECHNOLOGY. ABSOLUTELY I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD- THE IN PERSON SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND HAVING THE STAFF AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THAT IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. AS PART OF A HYBRID YOU KNOW TRYING TO TAKE THE BEST OF WHAT WE CAN DO- FOR THOSE PEOPLE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY. BUT ABSOLUTELY BEING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE IN PERSON SERVICES IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL. YEP AND THEN JUST- ONE MORE QUESTION HERE- IT WHAT KINDS OF CASES IF YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN FROM THESE SELF HELP CENTERS. AS TO THE KINDS OF CASES. THAT ARE HANDLED- AND- AND THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF FUNDING WENT TO THE SELF HELP SERVICES OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. ACT ABOUT THE ABOUT 78% OF THE CASES INVOLVE FAMILY LAW. DIVORCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OUT OF CUSTODY AND SPORTAGE IS. OF 18% I WENT TO THE CIVIL LAW OF CASES THIS IS HOW. THE BIRDS. WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT SIX WAS A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CIVIL CASES SO OF LANDLORD TENANT AND SMALL CLAIMS TO SERVE OUR FRESHMAN. OF MANY OF THESE CASE TYPES EFFECT WE- THAT WORKS INCREASED SERVICES. SIGNIFICANTLY AND LANDLORD TENANT CASES. OF IN FACT THAT NUMBER WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST PRIOR TO THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE HELP CENTERS ASSISTED ABOUT 8% OF THE CASES IN LANDLORD TENANT MATTERS. PRESS THE BOARD AND NOW OF A CENTERS ARE ASSISTING IN 22% OF THE CASES THAT ARE COMING BEFORE THE COURT AND WHEN IT MATTERS. AGAIN I FANTA THAT WILL INCREASE AGAIN WITH THE YOUNG- AS THE MORATORIUM WHAT AND THEN PROBATE WHICH IS PRIMARILY- GUARDIANSHIP OF FIVE CHILDREN THAT THE CARE OF AND A CONSERVATORSHIP IS ABOUT 4% OF THE SERVICES. AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDING WHICH USED OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING STAFF AND SO THE NUMBER OF STAFF THAT WERE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE INCREASE FROM A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX- FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX A QUICK WENT FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STAFF OF ATTORNEYS AND- NON ATTORNEY PROFESSIONALS. AND 46% OF THOSE NEW STAFF MEMBERS ARE BILINGUAL. OKAY- THIRTY. AND THE SPEND- THERE'S NINETEEN MILLION THAT WILL BE GOING TO THE SELF HELP CENTERS- DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS TO HOW THOSE- THE DELIVERY METHOD IT'S GOING TO BE USES IT PERSON IN PERSON VIRTUAL. HYBRID OF IN PERSON NUMBER JOEL. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE EVOLVING- JUST AS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EVOLVE I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT OF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE IN PERSON SERVICES THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED THAT- BOTH BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THESE ARE LIFE CHANGING EVENTS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT THEY'RE COMING TO WORK TO DEAL WITH THE COMING FOR OBJECTION ARE COMING FOR THE MASSIVE VIOLENCE THEY'RE COMING FOR OTHER THINGS. AND- FOR SOME FOLKS THAT'S OKAY IN TECHNOLOGY OTHER PEOPLE REALLY REALLY NEED MUCH MORE ON PERSONAL SERVICE. AND SO I THINK THAT AS I SAY I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THE COURTS HAVE MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES. IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE BEST WAYS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE DURING THIS PERIOD. AND I DON'T THINK WE KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER YET- THE DATA THAT WE HAD FOR THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS FROM TWENTY NINETEEN AND- EVERYTHING CHANGED IN TERMS OF. OF HOW PEOPLE ARE USING ASSISTANCE- WHAT STATE AT ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO- WE'RECONTINUING TO EVOLVE AND GROW AND REALLY. ENCOURAGE COURTS TO BE AS INNOVATIVE AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE BEST ASSISTANCE POSSIBLE TO THE MOST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. AND WE NEED EVERY WEEK NOW- WITH THE SELF HELP CENTER STAFF IN A WEBEX MEETING AND SUPPORT SHARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES AND IDEAS- AND I THINK WE'LL JUST REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THAT OF ALL. I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL THAT I KNOW THE EXACT RIGHT ANSWERS YET. OKAY THANK YOU. POLITICS SENATOR NEWMAN. SO I'M THIS CHECK AYE TO. IF I'M- NAIVE OR UNINFORMED SO. ON OKAY. QUESTION ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS INDICATE THAT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS INCOMPLETE- AS REQUIRED BY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET- BUT THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SUBMITTED A REPORT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TO COMPLY BUT WHICH THE L. A- WOULD ASSERT DID NOT SO WE WOULD- DID DID FRANK IT'S A COURSE FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH FIRST- WOULD YOU. DISAGREE WITH THE L. A. O.'S CHARACTERIZATION. OF HAVING FAILED TO DO THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. I THINK THAT WE ABSOLUTELY DID THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS I THINK THAT THEY ARE- AS THEY SAY THAT THERE WERE THINGS THAT WE HAD HOPED TO COLLECT APPROACH YOU HAVE A PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE SIMPLY COULDN'T DO AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK THAT THE- COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT WE SUBMITTED IT PROVIDES EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SORT OF THE MIX OF DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN WHERE WORKSHOPS CAN BE HELPFUL WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES- AND- HOW WHEN I WENT TO WORK- SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IT HAS PROVIDED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA. AND IT ALSO- ADDRESSED MANY OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND STAFF TO TALK ABOUT HOW FILINGS ARE NOT REJECTED- WHEN THEIR STUFF OF STAFF- PERFORMS ARE ACTUALLY LEGIBLE AND THEIR COMPLETE AND HOW MUCH TIME THAT SAVES THAT PARTIES UNDERSTAND THEIR CASES BETTER THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO COME TO COURT WERE PREPARED. AND THAT JUDGES AND COURT STAFF AND ARE BETTER REVIEW DOCUMENTS. IN IN MUCH LESS TIME. ALSO DOWN. THE INCREASED MEDIA. FOR SELF HELP US. TALK ABOUT THAT. JUST OVER. SERVICES BEING PROVIDED- AND- HOW MUCH MORE IS NEEDED AND WE DID A- CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. SURVEY IS PART OF THAT RECEIVE NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND- RESPONSES AND WHILE PEOPLE WERE THRILLED WITH THE SERVICE LISTEN NUMBER NINETY SIX PERCENT- WERE. EXTREMELY SATISFIED OR VERY SATISFIED AND- BUT THEY'RE THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE ASKED YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND THEY TALKED ABOUT WE NEED MORE STAFF- REDUCE WAIT TIMES AND LINES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS. A VERY STRONGLY. AND AGAIN I THINK THE KINDS OF IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION STRATEGY THAT I USE I. AM SURE THAT THE L. A. O. WITH- YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. AGAIN I THINK THAT IN TIME OF ENORMOUS. AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BECOME EXT REALLY DIFFICULT TO TELL AND- BOTH YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S. ACCEPTANCE AND ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING SO- I THINK THAT WE NEED- THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN UP YOU KNOW WE TOOK VERY- VERY- PROVIDE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL FOR US IN TERMS. OF MAKING DECISIONS AND MOVING FORWARD. CHAU AYE I THOUGHT SILVA GROW REST THAT IS VERY GOOD QUESTION ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD- YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND KIND OF EXISTING PROCESSES PRIOR TO- THE IMPLEMENTATION THESE NEW THINGS. SO HOW SHOULD WE USE THE LEGISLATURE RESPOND. TO THE L. A. U. S. RECOMMENDATION. TO INSIST UPON AND IT YOU KNOW AND- DATE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND TO USE AN EXTERNAL PARTY TO DO THAT. IS IT IT IS IT IN YOUR VIEW NECESSARY WOULD IT BE USEFUL. IS IT UNNECESSARY IF SO. HOW DO WE MAKE THE CORRECT ALLOCATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RIGHT MIX OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SELF HELP WITH THE OLD PROSTITUTE. WELL I WOULD SAY WE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY HAVING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT WE WILL BE- WITH WITH AND NOT OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS WILL ABSOLUTELY BE WATCHING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES HOW MANY SERVICES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOW THAT VARIES BY COUNTY OF THE SORTS OF THINGS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS GOING TO BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL TO- HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS- YOU KNOW TO SAY IF- WELL I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BUT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SELF HELP I WAS ABLE TO DO WITH THE INCREASE IN FUNDING. WESTRICK SPAN SILVERMAN'S OR MRS- WHICH WAS AS WE DID EARLIER I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE AND DEAL WITH THIS BACKLOG AND THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES. AND THOSE- YOU THINK IT BECOMES YOU KNOW. DEPENDS ON K. TYPE IT UP ON MANY FACTORS. IN TERMS OF AN ALLOCATION OF THOSE RESOURCES- AND THOSE ARE GOING TO CHANGE OVER TIME. AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS SO I DON'T I WILL SAY AS A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. I DON'T THINK THAT THE- ADDITIONAL- TYPE OF ANALYSIS- THAT IS BEING SUGGESTED BY THE L. A. R. WILL BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS COME BACK WITH MUCH MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION A WE WILL. AS WE ALWAYS DO- COME BACK WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEEDS AND WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED- FROM THE PROGRAMS AND- AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD. SURE THAT IS CHOI I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION AND MAYBE DOUBLING BACK TO AN EARLIER I'M SORTS HODGES OF LAND OKAY AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A COURT REPORTERS ALL RIGHT SO OVER THE PAST. NUMBER HERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE OF BUDGET LIMITATIONS. YOU HAD TO LIMIT THE HOURS. BODY FOR CORPORATE- IN THE VARIOUS. COURTS AND THAT AS A RESULT IS LIMITED ACCESS TO THE CONTINUATION OF TRIALS THE BILLING WHOLE TRIALS. SO WHAT LOOKING FORWARD. WHAT IS THE THINKING WITH RESPECT THE RESTORATION AND WHERE DOES NEW TECHNOLOGY FIT INTO THAT- IS IT IN LIEU OF ADDITIONAL- OF THE- FUNDING FOR TRADITIONAL COURT REPORTERS FOR IS IT IN IT AS A COMPLIMENT TO THAT. I AM NOT PREPARED TO ADDRESS THIS FOR I DON'T I DON'T MEAN TO SURPRISE YOU BUT THE APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS TO THE EARLIER QUESTIONS. I MEAN FOR SOMEONE ELSE MISTER MISTER- YOUNG MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT CAN SOMEONE ELSE THIS IS JUDGE HINRICHS I JUST WANTED TO JUMP IN ON THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE I NEED FOR EVALUATION CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE- SHOULD DO ANY. QUESTION THAT THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR ALLOCATIONS OF MONIES BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO ALLOW THE BRANCH WE'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE SERVICES AT SELF HELP TO TAKE A BREATH TO RESET TO RATE RIGHT SIZE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THEN TO COME TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT JOINTLY NEED TO. BETTER PROVIDE SERVICES AND BETTER DEMONSTRATE TO THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW IT'S JUSTIFIED- IT'S JUST A VERY CHALLENGING TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN TO THE FOR THE BRANCH BECAUSE- WE'RE LOOKING AT. HOW TO TRANSITION THROUGH AND TO GIVE ANY SORT OF WHAT WHAT TO LOOK AT NOW IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF HOW WILL BE CHANGED BY THE PANDEMIC ITSELF. AND WELL I THINK THE COURT REPORTER QUESTION MAYBE MORE COMPLEX- IN A LOT OF COUNTIES IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF. NOT HAVING RESOURCES FOR POOR PORTER SO THAT MAYBE SOMEONE OF AN ISSUE IS REALLY HAVING ENOUGH FOR PORTERS- TO. DO THE JOB WITH IN OUR COURTS JUST THIS LAST WEEK. WE COULDN'T PROCEED WITH PULMONARY HEARINGS BECAUSE THERE WERE NO COURT REPORTERS AVAILABLE TO. COME TO COURT TO DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE BECAUSE OF QUARANTINES AND OTHER ISSUES SO I THINK THE COURT PORTER ISSUE IS VERY VERY COMPLEX AND- WOULD. INVITE A DEEPER CONVERSATION BUT- BUT IT IS- CHALLENGING- IN MATTERS AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE BUT I THINK THAT'S A LONGER CONVERSATION IN INTO. OTHER IN OTHER WAYS YOU'RE A BREACH OF ITS OF MY UNDERSTANDING SAID THERE'S BEEN. YOU KNOW A- OF DEFERENCE GIVEN TO THE G. DISCONTINUED JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH EARLIER- IN HOW YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING ONCE IT'S PROVIDED. BUT CLEARLY TO YOUR POINT THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT COURT REPORTER RESOURCES. HAS BEEN A LOOMING FACTOR ON THE ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO FUNCTION WELL SO. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IS HAPPY TO GET DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THAT BUT I'M I'M NOT SURE. WHEN YOU. THINK ABOUT- DIVISIONS. OTHER OF THE SEPARATION POWER THAT THAT'S SOMETHING. YOU FOR. ARE NO. GOING TO WELCOME I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION- ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION. IS THAT WE REQUIRE ONE AND THAT. THIS COST WOULD BE ABSORBED. BY THE FUNDS PROVIDED SO IT WOULD COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ALLOCATION WE'RE GIVING YOU AND SO YOU KNOW LOVE FOR YOU TO RESPOND BECAUSE- THAT SEEMS REASONABLE- IF YOU IF YOU BUY INTO THE- THE NEED FOR IT- BUT IF YOU DON'T BUY INTO THAT NEED I DIED BUT I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO. LOSE THOSE FUNDS TO THAT BECAUSE- YEAH SO THIS IS ROBERT A YOUNG FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I CAN- ADDRESS THAT AT THIS POINT WE FEEL THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD USE OF THOSE FUNDS- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BASICALLY IT REPRESENTS- AN ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR NATIONAL ATTORNEY. WHO COULD BE AT A SELF HELP CENTER HELPING A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC AND ALTHOUGH I DO ACKNOWLEDGE- MS LEE'S COMMENTS IN TERMS OF- THE DESIRE TO HAVE MORE DETAIL IN THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS- AS- NEWS HEALTH MENTIONED IS COMPLETE AND IT DOES INDICATE STILL A HIGH NEED FOR MORE STAFF. FROM THE PUBLIC MORE STAFF MORE STAFF WHO CAN SPEAK. LANGUAGES AND SO AT THIS POINT WE FEEL THAT THE- INVESTMENT SHOULD GO DIRECTLY TO HELPING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE MAY WISH TO CONDUCT. A ADDITIONAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS TO HELP US IDENTIFY SPECIFIC AREAS FOR INVESTMENT BUT AGAIN AS MISSILES HAD MENTIONED- THE BIGGEST DEMAND RIGHT NOW IS IN FAMILY LAW. WE HAVE MADE. TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN EXPANDING INTO A CIVIL AS WELL AND THE DATA THAT WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT POINTS AS TO THOSE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED. BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT WE ARE NOT AT A POINT WHERE- WE CAN EVEN SATISFY THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE FEEL THAT THOSE FUNDS SHOULD GO DIRECTLY THEIR FIRST. AND AT SOME POINT LATER. WE CAN LOOK AT THE- ACERBIC AREA. AND THEN TO A THE OTHER QUESTION IN TERMS OF ALLOCATION OF THIS IS RELATED SOMEWHAT TO COURT REPORTERS- BUT IN TERMS OF OUR STRATEGY AND I HAD MENTIONED THIS EARLIER- RELATED TO REMOTE HEARINGS. OUR STRATEGY IS NOT A- STATE OR BE SERVICE OFFERING. OUR STRATEGY IS REALLY AND SERVICE OFFERING SO WE FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE OFFERING. PHYSICAL FACE TO FACE SERVICES AND REMOTE SERVICES BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE WIDEST- POPULATION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO WANT TO ACCESS SERVICES REMOTELY AS WELL AS THOSE. FACE TO FACE SO OUR STRATEGY FROM A JUDICIAL BRANCH PERSPECTIVE AND THE AND THE CHIEFS IN TERMS OF- ACCESS THREE D. IS REALLY PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL BOTH IN SIMULTANEOUS. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IF BUT IT DOESN'T THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL. DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE L. A. O. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE MET THIS REQUIREMENT SO I GUESS I'D ASK STAFF OR SOMEONE ELSE- IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH THAT REPORT- THE REPORTS SUBMITTED- THE REPORTING QUESTION. IT PROBABLY HELP WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THIS ITEM OPEN FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE. WHERE WE FALL IMAGE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER I DON'T. L. A. O. PLEASE MISLI. I WAS JUST GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL CONTACTS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND IN CASE THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE SENATORS- SO WHAT KIND OF A COUPLE ITEMS- FIRST IN TERMS OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LANGUAGE WHEN THIS REPORT WAS FIRST REQUIRED IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN CONDUCT IT OR THEY CAN CONTACT WITH THE RESEARCHER AND IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IT IS A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THERE WAS NO ROOM SORT OF FOR INTERPRETATION- AND SO. THAT THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE WOULD SORT OF EMPHASIZE IS THAT- THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS- HAS CONDUCTED A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN AREA RELATED TO SELF HELP AT LEAST ACCORDING TO OUR KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE DEAL HAVE- KIND OF AN IDEA OF WHAT A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WHAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND CONSIST OF WHICH I THINK IS A SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT FOR US WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE REPORT WHEN YOU'LL GET IT BEFORE YOU. IS SOMETHING THAT WE RECOGNIZE INCLUDES A LOT OF VERY HELPFUL OUTCOME DATA AND IT STARTS DOWN THE PATH OF IDENTIFYING THE BENEFITS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS FOR COMPLETING IT WE DON'T THINK IT'LL LIKELY EXCEED A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THE EXTERNAL RESEARCHER WILL BE ABLE TO USE- SOME OF THAT INFORMATION A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS COLLECTED THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT IT BUT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO USE A LARGE PORTION OF IT SINCE THEN THE FINISH OFF. A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS KIND OF GOING BACK TO MY COMMENTS YOU DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS LOOKS AT BENEFITS INSIDE THE MONETARY VALUE AND IDENTIFY THE COST YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT IN THE PIECE THAT YOU HAVE. AND THE CONCEPT FOR ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY YOU WHY COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS BE HOPEFUL IS THAT CAN REALLY HOLE- DETERMINE HOW WE MAXIMIZE USE OF THE DOLLARS AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IS THIS NEED FOR SELF HELP. DOLLARS WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT IT'S ISSUE ABOUT CAN WE- A TARGET IN USE THAT. SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDE AS MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED SERVICES AS POSSIBLE SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS MIGHT DETERMINE THAT WORKSHOPS ARE ONLY REALLY EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN CASE TYPES. SUCH AS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'RE STARTING DIVORCES OR THINGS LIKE THAT FULL ONE ON ONE SERVICES ARE REALLY. KIND OF THE MOST- COST BENEFICIAL AND GUARDIANSHIP OR PROBATE CASES. AND SO THAT'S HOW THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE USED TO INFORM DECISIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE DOLLARS. IT'S AWFULLY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL CONTEXT SECOND THAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO THAT SENATORS. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S VERY. HELPFUL I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN- I WOULD. ENCOURAGE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- YOU KNOW TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS- IT WAS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET THAT REQUIRED THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO CONDUCT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. AND I ASSUMED IT WAS ACCEPTED BY VIRTUE OF THAT BUDGET SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AND- AND RECONSIDER THE DOING THAT YOUR YOURSELF OR GETTING AN OUTSIDER OUGHT TO DO IT SO THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THAT WE NEED. OKAY CENTER COURTESY THANK VENTURE- THE GREAT DISCUSSION AT FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M KIND OF LEANING TOWARD THE- COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD BUT- I JUST WANNA SAY LISTEN TO EVERYONE. I THINK. THE OIL STARTED TO MAKE. A GOOD POINT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN HOW YOU HOLD THIS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IF YOU HOLD IT AS IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS OKAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO JUSTIFY THE COST IN THIS PURPOSE GOING THROUGH THIS EXERCISE. AS IF WE'RE TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON THE COST- YOU KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY FEELS A LITTLE THREATENING ESPECIALLY TO. YOU KNOW WHAT IS REALLY A GOOD PROGRAM OF FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY IS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR BUT AS- YOU KNOW AT WORK ATTORNEY WHO USED TO PRACTICE- IN AN AREA WHERE I GOT TO SEE- THE SELF HELP. COUNTER AT WORK YOU KNOW THE IN PERSON CALORIE JUST AS THE TREMENDOUS THING IS SOMETHING I THINK YOU'D WANT TO GROW. CERTAINLY WITH THE NEED- AS BEST WE CAN HOW TO KEEP UP WITH THAT NEED DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT ALLOWS US. TO JUSTIFY. NOT PASS INVESTMENT WERE CRACKING DOWN ON INVESTMENT BUT FUTURE IN AUGMENTATION- YOU KNOW MAYBE IT MAYBE MAYBE IT WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE I DON'T KNOW IT SO IT MAY SOUND LIKE SEMANTICS BUT I JUST THINK. EVERYONE SAYING THE SAME THING THIS IS A REALLY REALLY GOOD THING- IN WE JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOW TO MAXIMIZE NOT JUST THE INVESTMENT IN IT BUT THE PROGRAM ITSELF IN CONTINUE TO GROW- THAT SAID. I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY EARLIER THEME A LITTLE BIT AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW THESE CALL CENTERS I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IF I COULD. ASK US FOR RESPONSE. TO CHEER FROM- JUDICIAL COUNCIL- BECAUSE MISS HUFF THAT WAS WAS SPEAKING EARLIER- SHE MENTIONED THE UNLAWFUL DEATHS DETAINER CIDER THE LANDLORD TENANT SIDE OF THE SELF HELP CENTER- AYE AYE. AGAIN OCCUR EARLY WERE SAYING. THERE I THINK WE CAN ANTICIPATE NEED GROWTH OR- DEMAND A THINK IS A BETTER WORD ON ON SYSTEMS LIKE THIS CALL CENTER- EVEN BEFORE THE MORATORIUM IS LIFTED BECAUSE AS AS LANDLORD TENANT RELIEF MONEY GOES OUT. IN FOLKS ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS OF FI. YOU KNOW MY LANDLORD APPLIES THE 80% WHAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN THIS CREE UNLAWFUL DETAINER AND I KNOW I KNOW THE SELF HELP CENTER I MEAN TYPICALLY WOULD BE ENGAGED AT THAT POINT WHERE THERE'S ALREADY AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER. SOMEONE COMES IN PRO PER BASICALLY AND SAYS. I NEED HELP WITH THIS- AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS IT IS THERE ANY LEGAL OBSTACLE. TO THE CALL SIMPLY SELF HELP CALL CENTERS BEING DEPLOYED. PRIOR TO WORK IN ANTICIPATION OF A UT- SO THAT. WERE NOT BEHIND THE CURVE WERE NOT FLOODED WITH THESE CALLS. AFTER ALL THE UNLAWFUL DETAINERS GET FALL BUT PEOPLE CAN SCAN COME IN. AND PERHAPS GET REFERRED TO MEDIATION PROGRAM OR WHATEVER BUT GET THE GET TO THE COUNTER. SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND. WHAT THEY'RE TO THE EXTENT THE SELF HELP CENTERS ARE. ALLOWED TO DO SO- COMMUNITY GIVE THAT SORT OF COUNTER ADVICE- EVEN IN VIRTUAL REALITY. A TO FOLKS WHO ARE- IS SIMPLY ANTICIPATING- YOU KNOW THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OR THREATS BY THEIR LANDLORD IF IT'S A TENANT- COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT I JUST PICK IT WOULD REALLY WANT TO GET TO HERE IS WHAT'S IS. WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE GROWTH CURVE OF THIS EIGHT TO TWENTY TWO. IS THAT CAN GROW TO A 122% HERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WIN. WIN MONEY ROLES- PEOPLE START GETTING REALLY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT. YES I'D SAY THE ACTUALLY THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN SELF HELP CENTERS IN YOUR RIGHT IT IS- WOULD BE- WILL BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IF PEOPLE HAVE THAT INFORMATION BEFORE ALL THIS YET- SO- ABSOLUTELY THAT THE- WE'VE BEEN DOING TRAINING- REGULARLY ADAM AS THE LAWS CHANGE- ON. THE LABOR CANNOT ALWAYS- YEAH SB NINETY ONE AND OTHERS SO THAT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THOSE AND WE'VE DEVELOPED- SIMPLE FACT SHEETS AND CHECKLISTS AND RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. SO ABSOLUTELY THAT'S TOTALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SELF HELP CENTER- THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE FINDING RIGHT THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE. THOSE CALLS AND- IF YOU KNOW THERE'S MUCH MORE OF A DEMAND IN THE LANDLORD TENANT AREA- PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AS MANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES OR WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO AS MANY FAMILY LAW CASES OR OTHER KINDS OF THINGS SO- I. I THINK THAT WOULD- SELF HELP CENTERS ARE REALLY CRITICAL PART OF THE RESPONSE TIME TO- WEBER TENET CHALLENGE AND THE OTHER PIECE-IS GOING TO BE ONCE- SOME OF THOSE CASES HAD SMALL CLAIMS. OF I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE INCREASE RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE GOING TO SPLIT LANDLORDS PRESUMABLY WILL BE GOING TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT BACK RENT- IF THEY'RE OT ABLE TO HELP THE PERSON WITH PROPERTY. AND THERE ARE NO INJURIES AND SMALL PLANES AND SO HAVING THE SELF HELP CENTER ASSISTANCE HELP PREPARE PEOPLE TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WHICH ARE YOU KNOW. EARLY COMPLICATED UNDER THE LAW IS GOING TO BE A SENSE OF. SO AND I AM I CAN I JUST ALSO SAY I REALLY RECOGNIZE I THINK WE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT A WORKSHOPS AND WE'RE WORKSHOPS ARE HELPFUL AND GREATER. CHALLENGES AND I THINK WE CAME UP WITH A LOT OF GREAT DATA- THAT I HOPE WILL INFORM YOUR DECISIONS BUT HAS CERTAINLY HELPED INFORM OURS MOVING FORWARD. IN A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. I JUST. WHAT I DON'T AYE IT'S IDEA THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR READING. THANK YOU FOR ME TO THE CHURCH OF CONCLUDE HERE- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME A- YEAH I'M NOT BUDGET WAS THE I'VE ONE NIGHT CRITICAL. OF THE IS FOR. THE FAR IT TO FEELS LIKE IT'S SOME FOR WE WANT TO. GO WITH THIS BENEFIT NOW. PER A MONOPOLY IT OFF THAT. THAT SAID. HOW CAN WE GET OR WHO COULD PROVIDE. GROWTH METRICS. ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. I MEAN I GET IT AT THE ONE AT ONE POINT. OKAY WELL LEVEL THAT WE DON'T KNOW- WORKED WITH THIS COULD BE AN AVALANCHE OR OR- UGH JUST AN INCREASING SORT OF TRICKLE. OF GROWTH- BUT WHATEVER. YOU FOLKS WOULD WOULD ANTICIPATE IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO SORRY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO LEASE CASE THE LEAST WORST CASE SCENARIO IS IT POSSIBLE JUST TO GET SOME MATH JUST TO GET SOME ARITHMETIC ON THAT EITHER TO WORK. OUR STAFF HERE A CONSULTANT FOR OR DIRECTLY TO THESE OFFICES ARE BOTH- I JUST THINK WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL GOING FORWARD SO WE IF THERE IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO. AND I'M NOT. YOU KNOW IN ANY WAY TRY TO PREDISPOSE THE ATTITUDES AMONG MY COLLEAGUES WHO TAKES BOTH TO DO THINGS BUT IF THERE IS AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE. THAT WE DON'T SHORT CHANGE THIS PART OF THE EFFORT TO CALL CENTER AND SO FORTH. I THINK WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO HAVE NUMBERS ON THE TABLE. THE THAT WE CAN. THAT WE CAN LOOK AT RATHER THAN. NOT HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IN IN JUST ESSENTIALLY WHAT SOME POINT BE TAKING A VOTE ON. YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US RIGHT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T MAKE UP THE NUMBERS HERE SO THAT. CAN YOU CAN HELP WITH THAT. AND IF I COULD JUST BAD- SECRETARY IF I COULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK- THE- WHEN THIS PANDEMIC KID AND WE WERE FACED WITH MAKING DECISIONS LIKE THE REPORT TORY ELEMENT. AND ALL THE OTHER EMERGE REGENCY DECISIONS- IT- WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ON YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE ANY POTENTIAL EVICTIONS OR OF PROBLEMS THAT RENT IS WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING BUT ESPECIALLY FICTIONS. BUT SEEMS TO ME HERE'S LIKE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AGAIN THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IS DOING THIS IS WHAT YOU DISH OF BRANCH COULD BE DOING AND MAKE SURE WERE AS CONNECTED AS POSSIBLE WITH. THE FUNDING ON THE POLICIES AND THOSE OF YOU KNOW ALL THE GREAT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND DOING WORK LIKE AROUND THE SELF HELP THAT THAT SHOULD BE AS COORDINATED AS POSSIBLE TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT BECAUSE- IN SOME WAYS WE WERE GETTING PAST THE PANDEMIC WAS TRYING TO GET PAST IT AND ON THE HEALTH FRONT. HEALTH CARE FRONT. BUT THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S ALL SORT OF BACK TO NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO RENTERS. I'M SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. OKAY I GUESS AS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU- THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN- AND WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE.

REQUEST WILL EXPAND UPON A PILOT PROGRAM APPROVED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WHICH IMPLEMENTED ONLINE TRAFFIC EDUCATION AND THE ABILITY TO PAY PROJECTS IN THE COURTS. SPENDING THIS PROGRAM STATEWIDE AMOUNTS OF FISSION SHE'S BY USING TECHNOLOGY FOR ONLINE EDUCATION INSTRUCTIONS AND PROVIDES TARGETED RELEASE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ALLOWING THEM TO APPLY ONLINE HEATHER FINES AND FEES REDUCED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AGAIN WE HAVE SHOWN KERN AND HIS NATIONAL LETTER HERE TO RESPOND AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- WITH FINANCE LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. BERMAN FINANCING JUST LIKE TO ADD EXTENSIONS FIVE OF HIS PROVIDES TARGETED OR WE GET THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST AND ALLOW FOR FURTHER MODERNIZATION FOR OPERATIONS GIVEN THE BURDEN FINDING THESE CURRENTLY HABITABLE TO. YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE LEAD TO SUCH INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. FURTHERMORE THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS FOR THE TRIAL COURTS TO MODERNIZE THE SHOW FEATURES SUCH AS ONLINE EDUCATION OF FRACTIONS WHICH FURTHER PROMOTES ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR USERS. AND ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT ON A FEW OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY L. A. L. I NEED WILL BREAK THEM DOWN ROTH THOROUGHLY. PRESENTATION IN REGARDS TO THIS THING FRIEDMAN SHARE ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING ON THE RESULTS FROM THE HIGHWAY THE PRELIMINARY OUTCOMES FROM THE PARTICIPATING FOR SENATE IMPLEMENTED EIGHTY KIANA VALUATIONS IS PROMISING. AND HAS REDUCED FRIENDS EXCUSE FOR LONG COMMUNITIES WALLS COVERING FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS OF JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WE ARE PROPOSING A PHASED ROLLOUT OF THE PROGRAM AND INSTITUTIONAL DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES. OR THE ABILITY OF A PROGRAM. ALSO THE THAT THE THIS BUILDING WILL DOESN'T WORK WHEN FOR THE- OVERALL TYLER PORT IN ALL OF THE WORK. THAT MAKES. IN A DA ONLINE. HATE HOWEVER WE ARE OPEN WORKING WITH LET'S PACKS L. A. THE REFINE THE REPORT LANGUAGE IS. AT THE TRAILER TO LANGUAGE. ON THE L. A. L. HAS ALSO CAN ABOUT FUTURE COST INCREASES FOR THE OTHER FEATURES PORTABILITY HEY WE JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT COSTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE TO IMPLEMENT THE OTHER FEATURES INCLUDED. ON HOWEVER IS pMODERNIZATION VESTMENTS IN THE TRAVELS TO PROMOTE ACCESS. TO JUSTICE JANAK TARGET. I SPECIFICALLY IN THE- OF ONLINE AND- THIS WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR USERS THEM TO RESOLVE. BUSINESS WITHOUT HAVE IT TAKES OFF WORK OR AWAY FROM NEXT TO WHICH A- PRISTINE FOR FRACTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISLI. IS A MYSTERY OR YEAH. YES I NEARLY WITH THE L. A. L. SO WE HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE ITEM BEFORE YOU SO FIRST WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CANCEL THE PILOT CANCEL THE REQUIRED EVALUATION AND EXPAND THE POOL ONLINE- THIS IS. THIS IS BECAUSE IN A CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE TOOL ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FINALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED SO FOR EXAMPLE ONLINE TRIALS ARE NOT SLATED TO ACTUALLY COME ONLINE UNTIL- YOU KNOW A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW AND SO IT COULD MEAN THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT ARE DIFFERENT- IN ADDITION IN TERMS OF THE EVALUATION WE WOULD KNOW THAT. WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LANGUAGE IN THE EVALUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY ON IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU AND SO- MORE COMPLETE DATA FROM THE EVALUATION OF THE COMPLETED HIGH LET IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT CAN HELP INFORM- THE LEGISLATURE ON THE FULL IMPACT OF ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WERE BEING TESTED WHICH COULD THEN BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER HIGHER REDUCTIONS FOR INCOME- FOR THOSE WHO FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME. OR MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT PROVIDING AN AUTOMATIC PRODUCTION FOR ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO DON'T CURRENTLY FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME SO THESE ARE AND THAT'S WHAT IS THAT COULD HAVE- DECISIONS THAT COULD BE INFORMED. BY THE EVALUATION. UPSET WE DO. THAT THE ABILITY TO PAY COMPONENT OF THE KIND THAT DEFINITELY PROVIDES MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND PROMOTES. EQUITY AND SO TO FURTHER THAT WE WOULD- RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE THOUGH ONLY IMPROVE THE TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION REQUESTED IN THE BUDGET. SO THAT WOULD ROLL OUT TO ADDITIONAL TEN COURTS AS ENVISIONED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE PEOPLE WITH FINANCIAL RELIEF FROM PROMOTE. EIGHT BUT IT WOULD PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUING BEYOND THE BUDGET YEAR BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY OF CLEAR BREAK TO DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES IF ANY THAT IT WANTS TO MAKE- FROM BASED OFF OF THE INFORMATION THAT I GOT FROM THE EVALUATION- OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THERE IS PROPOSED- PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE FINANCE TO ALLOCATE THE BACK FULL REVENUES. AMONGST THE VARIOUS JUDICIAL BRANCH FUNDS WE THINK THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AMOUNT PROVIDED IS COMMENSURATE WITH A LOT- AND OUR FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSES TO AUTHORIZE TRIAL COURTS TO CONDUCT ALL INFRACTION PROCEEDINGS REMOTELY UPON CONSENT OF THE DEFENDANT WHICH WOULD BE BEYOND TO THE OFFICES OF THIS ONLINE TOOL- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT CAN PROMOTE EQUITY AND INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE COURTS. AND THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO APPROVE IT WE DO RECOMMEND THOUGH THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SUBMIT AN EVALUATION OR REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LANGUAGE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S CURRENTLY QUITE A BIT OF UNKNOWNS. FOR EXAMPLE WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNOW WHICH COURTS HOW MANY QUARTS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AUTHORIZATION AND EXACTLY HOW THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT. IN LINE WITH THAT THERE'S ALSO NOT QUITE CLEAR IMPACT ON WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON CORE OPERATIONS ARE COSTS SO FOR EXAMPLE- REMOTE PROCEEDINGS MAY BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO CONTEST. AND FRACTIONS- MORE SO THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DONE THEY WOULD NORMALLY JUST PAID OFF AND SO THAT COULD LEAD TO INCREASED WORKLOAD. ON THE FLIP SIDE THIS COULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DEALING WITH THESE CASES BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW I'M THAT WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE REPORTING WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL- TO INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS SUCH AS WHETHER OR NOT REMOTE PROCEEDING SHOULD BE EXPANDED. TO OTHER CASE TYPES FOR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FROM. IS THE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR OF FINANCE MISTER ROMIJN YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT- THE PHASED ROLLOUT THAT YOU'D BE OPEN DID I HEAR YOU'RE RIGHT WE SAID DID YOU BE OPEN TO THAT IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE MISS LEE JUST SAID ABOUT HIS GOING TO THE TEN ADDITIONAL COURTS AND NOT- OR DID I. GET THAT RIGHT. ISN'T THAT THEM THE SAME THING THAT YOU'RE SAYING ARE YOU SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT RESTORE ONLY. NOT FROM MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IT WOULD AND HE DOES ALLUDING TO IS IF OF THE VARIOUS PARTIAL EXPANSION JUST FOR THAT FIRST IN THE FIRST BUDGET YEAR. TO THE I THINK IT WOULD A TEN COURTS WHERE ARE PROPOSAL IS JUST A PHASE ROLLOUT. MORE OF A OF COURSE EACH YEAR WE HAVE THAT A NATIONAL INITIAL ROLLOUT THAT MEET ADDRESS AND THEN TWENTY YEAR YEAR BASIS WE HAD ON INTEL EVENTUALLY WE GET TO. EXPANSION DAHLE FIFTY WORKS. IN AND THAT COME SOME ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT IS REQUIRED TO TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR GOES UP TO THE YEAR FOLLOWING UP TO TWENTY FIVE ONE. MILLION AND THEN FORTY SEVEN MILLION FALLING BACK AND THEN IN TOTAL WHEN THIS IS BANG WE SHOP ALL OF THE TRIAL COURT FIFTY EIGHT POINT ONE DOLLARS. RIGHT AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING APPROVED THAT NOW THE ONE APPROVAL TO DO ALL OF IT NOW OVER FACETIME NOT. TO IT ONE YEAR FOR TEN COURTS AND THEN. TAKE IT FROM THERE. YES THANK YOU THANKS A LOT ALL FIFTY. SOME AND- HAVE ALL OF THAT THE TOOLS FUNCTIONS BEEN ROLLED OUT. FOR IT TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THE ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE OKAY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SHELLEY KERN I'M- THE DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AM I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS IN MY CITATIONS ARE FULLY DEVELOPED NOW AND THEY'RE IN HOUSTON IN THE SIX COUNTIES THAT ARE- CURRENTLY UP AND RUNNING- OF THE ONLINE TRAVEL THURMOND DECLARATION FEATURE IS ALSO FULLY DEVELOPED- IT INCLUDES LIVE AGAIN COURT AN OFFICIAL- JUDICIAL OFFICER MODULES. AND THAT THAT FEATURE IS NOW IN DEPLOYMENT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY- THE LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE PILOT COURTS OFFER LITIGANTS OPTIONS FOR AT LEAST THREE FUNCTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY TO PAY- AND ALL. PORTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT. THANK YOU. COULD YOU JUST SEE- GET AS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHAT PIECES OF INFORMATION KIND OF WALK ME THROUGH QUICKLY WHAT PIECES OF INFORMATION WITH SOMEONE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR WHO MEETS THE POVERTY GUIDELINES WHAT WOULD THEY NEED TO SUBMIT TO RECEIVE THE REDUCTION IN THEIR FINANCE AND OR FEES. YEAH SURE SO THE WEED CONTROL WORKS IS- AN INDIVIDUAL AND A DEMO OF OUR TOOL ACTUALLY IS AVAILABLE ONLINE SO PEOPLE CAN CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LINDA JO GETS ONLINE AND THEY CAN USE EITHER THEIR COMPUTER OR TABLET OR THEIR CELL PHONE- THEY ENTER THEIR CITATION NUMBER AND WHERE THEY RECEIVE THEIR CHEQUE AT AFTER THAT THEY HAVE AN OPTION TO PROCEED IN SPANISH FOR AN ENGLISH- AND THEN THERE ARE ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR INCOME SO AFTER. QUESTION I REALLY QUESTION ABOUT THE **** ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY RECEIVE CERTAIN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BENEFITS- IF THEY SAY YES THAT THEY RECEIVE THE BENEFIT THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF ACTUALLY TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEIR BENEFITS SO- A BENEFIT CARD AND UPLOADING IT TO THE JUDICIAL OFFICER CAN CONSIDERATE- THEY ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR INCOME- HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES. HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND THEN THEY SUBMIT BACK. TO THE COURT FOR CONSIDERATION. THROOP BY TAKING A PICTUREIT AND- YEAH THANK YOU BUT IF THEY DO. HAVE ABILITY TO DO THAT FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE PROOF OF INCOME- THEN THEY CAN JUST EXPLAIN THERE'S A PLACE ON ON THE ON THE TOOL WHERE THEY CAN EXPLAIN- THAT THEY ARE RECIPIENTS BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE. A PROOF OF INCOME AND EXPLAINED WHY IT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE PROOF OF INCOME- AND ALSO ANY OTHER EXPENSES THEY MIGHT HOUSE OF THEY'VE GOT MEDICAL DATA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE THAT. ALSO THROUGH THE TOOL AS WELL. AND ARE ALL THE PILOT COURTS MAKING ABOUT FIFTY. 50% REDUCTION. FROM FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REDUCTION. EIGHT TOOL. DEPARTMENT THE STATUTE ITSELF RECTIFIED REQUIRES THAT- THE TOOL RECOMMENDS AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION AND SO WE HAVE A BY. A VARIETY OF- RESPONSES AMONG THE COURTS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING TO- RECIPIENTS. SO THE AVERAGE IS PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING- WE HAVE SOME COURTS THAT FOR THE AVERAGE IS HIGHEST. AT SEVENTY SIX PERCENT. AND SOME BETTER BETTER 41% GIVEN THAT- WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT WAYS OF RELIEVING. FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS AND BARRIERS OF. HAS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL pRECONSIDERED CHANGES TO THE ELIGIBILITY PERCENT REDUCTION OR MANDATING USE OF THE REDUCTION ON UPON STOP STATEWIDE ROLLOUT. WELL THAT THIS IS THE BILL LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY IN STATUTE THAT SAYS THE TOOL HAS TO RECOMMEND AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT- PEOPLE WANT TO CONSIDER- WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION JUDICIAL OFFICERS GET THIS INFORMATION THEY LOOK AT A VARIETY OF- FACTORS IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION- 475% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THE REQUEST ACTUALLY RECEIVE REDUCTIONS SO WE ARE SEEING. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT- MOVEMENT IN THIS REGARD AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT RECEIVING REDUCTIONS SO SURE REJECTED MAJORITY OF THOSE- HAVE TO DEAL WITH- THEY THEY IT'S A DUPLICATE REQUESTS RIGHTS OF 38% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REJECTED HAVE A DUPLICATE REQUEST- 31% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REJECTED- WHO DON'T RECEIVE REDUCTIONS HIS MATE- DON'T RECEIVE A REDUCTION BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE REQUESTING A REDUCTION FOR. A TYPE OF CASE IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE SO MISDEMEANOR FOR EXAMPLE- 8% OF THE TIME PEOPLE ACTUALLY ALREADY PAID OFF THEIR TRAFFIC TICKETS SO MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING REDUCTIONS. IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING REDUCTIONS A LOT OF TIMES IT'S FOR THE REASONS THAT I HATE THAT I SUGGESTED AND- WE ARE AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WE'RE WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ON ON. QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED. OKAY COLLEAGUE. QUEST NOW. NO THREE YOU COULD REDUCE OKAY OKAY OF. OKAY WE'RE GONNA AS- THAT CORRECT HOLD OPEN THIS ITEM WE WANT TO ISSUE FOR- THESE ARE ON VARIOUS MAINTENANCE AND FACILITY MODIFICATION PROPOSALS. ESSENTIALLY THIS IS LIKE COMPARING THE CHANNEL BRIEFLY JUST TOUCH ON AND THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS- FIRST IS A THIRTY NINE DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION ON FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. WE HAVE RECEIVED A ONE TIME THE PUBLICATIONS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- SO THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL TIME INVESTMENT IS LINDROS VITAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN TRIAL COURTS AND APPELLATE COURTS ARE USED TO SUPPORT MODERNIZATION OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS H. FAQ. ELEVATORS REPLACEMENTS ON MY- MY NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT- I'M STAYING IN THE OPERATIONS OF. THE TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS. SECOND PURPOSE IS. TO CENTRO WHAT MONTH. THE SUBSTITUTED BY- SINCE THE- IN OUR FIRE LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS THE DEFINED BY THE STATE FARM MARSHALL- AND- DECLARE THERE ARE PROJECTS IN ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES THAT NEED. ATTENTION INSURE THAT THEY ARE. SAFE FROM OPERATING FACILITIES. THIRD AND I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY CRITICAL PROPOSAL FOR US- HIS RELATES TO ON TRIAL COURT IN A COURT OF APPEAL FACILITY MAINTENANCE LEASES. AND INCREASE OF FIFTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING ON IN FACT ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT AND THE- FACILITY MAINTENANCE. AT OUR TRANSPORT IMPORTS OF PEELS- THIS IS AN AREA OF NEED I'M IN WHICH YOU WERE GLAD TO SEE THE BUDGET IS SUPPORTING- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE. A SIGNIFICANT A PORTFOLIO OF FACILITIES IS ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED. AND AS IT STANDS NOW WE ARE NOT AT THE LEVELS OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THAT IS LEADING TO- UNDERVALUATION WITHOUT FACILITIES AND SO. OVER CHRISTIAN OF PROPOSED. AND HOPE TO FIND YOUR IS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE DO HAVE. HELLO COMMITTEE IN JENKINS VALE SERVICE AND SPECIFIC ABOUT THESE THREE. MY NAME AND ARE SHOULD RESPOND IN THE- THANK YOU- FINANCE IS IT WAS TO REMIND. HI JESSICA NINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON TO THE TRIAL COURT OF THE FACILITY MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL JUST FOR BACKGROUND PURPOSES BETWEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. INCLUDED TWENTY POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR TRAVEL SO HE'S CONTRACTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHICH IS ONE FACILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PORTFOLIO AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE BASED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ISSUE STANDARD FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR SO. SHE THE REST OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S BUILDING PORTFOLIO IF SO HE'S CONDUCTED PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S FUNDING IS VITAL TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO MAINTAIN THEIR FACILITIES. BY MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS ALLOWING FOR TRANSPORTING COURTS OF APPEALS TO BE FUNDED HAPPEN YOU INDUSTRY STANDARD THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO THIS WILL PREVENT. FUTURE CITY MAINTENANCE ISSUES. VIRGINIA FLOODING AND AS WELL AS TO NAMES ISSUES. I'M INTERESTED IN TO L. L. COMMENTING. RE DIRECT. ON BEING- SINCE THE IMMEDIATE ACT PACKAGE RESTORE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE MILLION ON. YEAH FUND SUPPORT THE TRANSPORT. THAT REDIRECTION FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR ASKS REFERENCE FOR THE L. A. L. I'M- WELL IN OUR FIRST THIS NO LONGER WOULD BE NEXT. IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CELANESE SHOULD STILL BE PRIORITIZE FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISLI- I NEED A LEAD OUT WITH THE L. A. I. I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THESE PROPOSALS- WHAT MR MINE WAS REFERENCING WAS THAT- THIS WAS ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE PUT ON THAT WE OFFER TO THE LEGISLATURE AS A CONSIDERATION AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE TO THE TRIAL COURTS AND SPECIFICALLY HOW YOU'RE ALLOCATING. THE DOLLARS AND SO- IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY OR YOU KNOW. PUT IT INTO A PARTICULAR POT FOR EXAMPLE TO DRESS PANDEMIC RELATED ðPONSES WERE JUST SAYING THIS WAS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT YOU COULD POTENTIALLY REACH IRAQ'S- BUT MISTER I HAS A- VERY APT POINT WHERE RESTORATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHICH WAS. JUST A RECENTLY PROPOSED. THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU- I HAVE A QUESTION A ONE SORRY YES THAT WAS IT- COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR THE FIVE POSITIONS OF AND WHAT WOULD THESE FIVE POSITIONS BE DOING THAT THE CURRENT FORTY THREE POSITIONS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO FACILITY OPERATIONS CAN'T DO. HELLO MCCORMICK RESPONDED THAT QUESTION THAT AND SHARE. SO YOUR SYSTEMS ARE ALL WORKING. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY USED TO SING WITH LONGER IF HE'S AVAILABLE. THE DALLAS ON THE SCREEN. SHE WAS ON THE NEEDED. ASSISTING WHOSE- VIDEOS LIVE OKAY AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND GO AHEAD MR SINGH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JACK AND SAYING I'M THE PRINCIPAL MANAGER AND FACILITY SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SO THESE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WE CURRENTLY HAVE A- DEFICIT WITHIN OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS DR. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO DO ALL THE PREVENTIVE OF VERY FILE THE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SO THESE POSITIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE IN THE AREA TO IN THE SOUTHERN REGION AND WON A SUPERVISOR WHICH WILL BE A STATE REGULATION. SO THOSE ARE THE FIVE POSITIONS THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AS YOU NO GCC PORTFOLIO IS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY COURTS LIKE THIS. PLEASE AND- SO THESE WILL BE IN OF THESE FIVE POSITIONS BE DEPLOYED SO THAT. BECAUSE OF. L. THIS SIZE OF THE CERTAIN REGIONS WHERE- WE HAVE ALL THE WAY FROM OREGON BORDER. OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE COVERAGE IN THERE AND- ALL. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE STAFF EFFICIENCY AND- AND MORE TIME WILL BE DEDICATED BY. BY THE STAFF TO MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND INCREASED OVERSIGHT OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND LESS- NONPRODUCTIVE TIME TO TRAVEL BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES. OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES OPERATIONS STOPS THE DISTRIBUTED IN TWENTY DIFFERENT COURTHOUSE LOCATIONS IN EACH REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR. ADMINISTRATING SERVICES TO ALL THEIR PROBLEMS IF YOUR CREATIONS. OF THE FIVE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS OF FOCUS IN THAT AREA REGIONS WHERE ARE. THE LONGEST IN THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE. TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN THE COURTS AS AN EXAMPLE KRISTOFFERSON'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BUTTE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT COMPLEX AN AUDIBLE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MODOC COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT IN OUTROS SPEECHES OR FOUR HOURS DRIVE FROM ALL REALLY. AND THE MORE SEVERE COLD WHICH IS A MEMBER PLAGUE SWITCHES FIREHOUSE FORM STRIVE FOR MORE WILL. SO IN ORDER. NATION'S LIKE A LADY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS DRINKING BACK TO SOUTH INDIA AS WELL. OKAY WELL. THE. I'M NOT SURE THAT COVERS AND SATISFIES MY- QUESTION- COLLEAGUES DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM NOW. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON THEN HOLDING THAT OPEN ISSUE FIVE IS ON THE CONSTRUCTION FUND CONSOLIDATION TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AGAIN THIS IS LIKE OF EUROVISION'S COUNCIL CAN PROVIDE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW THE AGENDA DOES A FINE JOB OF PLANET BUT ALSO TO START WITH THE ISSUE OF. FINDING FEE REVENUES- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS HEARD OVER THE YEARS ISSUES WITH DECLINING- CRIMINAL REVENUES IN FINES AND FEES FROM THAT SOURCE THE- TWO OF OUR- SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION FUNDS THE SAUDI FUNDS THE LION PART ON THOSE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN EXPENSES. MMHM IS HE SAID THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINING REVENUES HERE ON OUR STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND IS FACING INSOLVENCY IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OTHER GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO COMBINE THIS FUND WITH ANOTHER PHONE CALL THE IMMEDIATE AND CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNTS. INTO A SINGLE FUND I'M AND AT THAT MEETING CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT HAS REVENUES THAT CAN SUPPORT. THE OTHER FIND AND TRY NOT TO MAKE IT TOO COMPLICATED THE BEST A GREAT AS ENOUGH IN THE BANK TO HELP COVER THE SHORTFALL IN THE OTHER ACCOUNTS. FOR IN THE BUDGET YEAR. MY LONG TERM RISK- WE WOULD BE WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND ALLEGED- TO LOOK AT- GENERAL FUND OPTIONS WELL WE REALLY DON'T HAVE FINANCED THE- SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING INSOLVENCY. OF THESE FUNDS AND SO WE WOULD BE DEFINITELY LOOKING TOWARDS- GENERAL FUND. AS THE SOLUTION FOR THAT AGAIN THAT IS- TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LET'S SEE TO DO SO. ON THESE FUNDS PROVIDE- COULD COST OF REVENUES TO COVER. THAT SERVICE WHICH IS VERY CRITICAL EXPENSE OF OURS- FACILITY MODIFICATIONS ARE COURTHOUSES ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FUNCTIONING- APPROPRIATELY AND TO FIND OF THE STAFF THAT SUPPORT OUR ENTIRE FEEL SILLY STORIES IN CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. SO THOSE ARE CRITICAL EXPENSES ON THAT THESE FUNDS ARE COVERING AND DUE TO LACK OF THE ONGOING REVENUES WE DO NEED ON AN ONGOING SOLUTION AND THAT SOLUTION AT THIS JUNCTURE DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A GENERAL. AND THE QUESTIONS- IN FREEDOM TO RESPOND. OKAY FINANCES TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU. YES. YOU KNOW MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I JUST LIKE TO ASK THAT THE INDIAN CURRY BELIEVES ACCOUNT IS A SUB ACCOUNT OF THE STATE FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND BY CONSOLIDATING THESE FUNDS THIS ALLOWS FOR THE STATE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION REMAIN SOLVENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR WITH ALPHA EIGHT GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION FOR MORE ABOUT THE FUND TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S FACILITIES PROGRAM AS WELL AS MENTIONED- IN A DAY IN ADDITION CONSOLIDATION PERMITS BUDGETARY. EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF SPECIAL FUNDS SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SPECIAL FUNDS SB ADMINISTERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STAFF IT'S LESS ADMINISTRATIVE WORK FOR THEM TO COMPLETE. IN REGARDS TO THE L. A. S. RECOMMENDATION ON A IN COMBINED MOVING RESPONSE TO THE GENERAL FUND I'M HERE SAYING- ANYWAY WE'RE ESSENTIALLY MAKING FOR FACILITY MAINTENANCE WE WOULD LOOK AT ME REVENUE FROM CORE ASSEMBLY MAINTENANCE AND THIS WOULD COMPETE WITH OTHER FUNDING FOR OTHER PURPOSES. INSIDE THE GENERAL FUND FOR EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE. WELL IN THE FUTURE THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE FUTURE- TO KEEP THE FUND'S SOLVENCY THIS. IS WINDY AS SIGNIFICANT AS MOVING. THE PROGRAM ENTIRELY TO THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY THANK YOU- L. A. PLEASE. ANY DALY WITH THE L. A. L. SO WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOTH ISSUES FIVE AND SIX AND GATHER BECAUSE- ISSUE FIVE PERTAINS TO KIND OF EXISTING OBLIGATIONS SUPPORTED BY THE ACCOUNTS AND THEN YOUR ISSUE SIX- WHICH IS FOR ADDITIONAL NEW TRAVEL CONSTRUCTION OBLIGATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON THE FUTURE AND SO AS A LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING. AFFECTED WE RESTARTING CHILDHOOD CONSTRUCTION WE THOUGHT IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO KIND OF PACKAGE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY KIND OF INTERTWINED WITH ONE ANOTHER. SO AT MINIMUM WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE TWO ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE IT DOES DELAY THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT WE WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT IT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE TO MAINTAIN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS WHEN BOTH ARE GOING TO BECOME INSOLVENT ANYWAY- BECAUSE BOTH PLANS ARE GOING TO BE AND SALAS AND THERE IS THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW THIS INSOLVENCY WOULD BE ADDRESSED THAT'S NOT PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- WE ARE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY GO FURTHER- WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE ACCOUNTS TO BE ELIMINATED AND THAT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIAL FOR CONSTRUCTION BE SHIFTED OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND- SO. ABSENCE ANY CHANGES SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN- EXISTING OBLIGATIONS WHICH MOST NOTABLY IS FINANCING PAYMENTS FOR A TRUCKER CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED. AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT WE MEAN BY SIGNIFICANT OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE NEEDED BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND GENERAL FUND WOULD BE NEEDED THROUGH THE NEXT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS IT WOULD DECLINE IN THE OUT YEARS. AS WE KIND OF COMPLETELY PAY OFF THE FACILITIES BUT IT'S NOT AN IN SYNC IT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SO BY SHIFTING THINGS OVER. IT ENSURES THAT ALL OF THE GENERAL FUND RESPONSIBILITY THE OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR. WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING- SPENDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION AND DETERMINING ITS GENERAL FUND SPENDING PRIORITIES WITH ALL OF THAT FULL KNOWLEDGE AT ALL THAT IS BEING ACCOUNTED FOR. ALSO IN LINE WITH THIS ALL OF THE NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED EXPENDITURES SUCH AS FOR FACILITY- MODIFICATIONS IN FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS WOULD ALSO SHIFT OVER. AND SO THEY WOULD NEED TO BE AN APPROPRIATION TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. FINALLY WE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDING. THAT ALL OF THE CONSTRUCTION RIGHT. ALSO LEAD TO PAY INTO THE GENERAL SO THAT THERE'S STILL A BILL. TO OFFSET THE X. SHIFTED OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND AND SO- YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT COMPETITION WITH OTHER THINGS. THE GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WHETHER THEY ARE NEW OBLIGATIONS MOVING FORWARD OR OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY IN HER. WHEN THAT LEGISLATURE CREATED THE ACCOUNT THE ENVISIONED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO BASICALLY PAY FOR THEM THAT'S KIND OF HOW LANGUAGE WAS ESTABLISHED. GIVEN THE DECLINING FROM OFFLINE IF YOU REVENUES AS A JUDICIAL BRANCH TALKED ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND WILL NOT LIKELY HAVE TO STEP UP AND BASICALLY PAY FOR THEM AND SO THERE IS ALREADY GOING TO BE AN IMPACT. ON GENERAL FUND SPENDING PRIORITIES AS A LEGISLATURE THINKING ABOUT BACK. MOVING FORWARD. AS YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING ON THE NEXT ISSUE ITEM WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO FINDING ANY NEW PROJECTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THAT MEANS THAT YOU'LL BE YOU'LL BE APPROVING PROJECTS SEPARATE FROM THE CONSTRUCTION YES SEPARATE FROM THE AMOUNT OF CRIMINAL FINES YOU REVENUE THAT'S COMING AND YOU DON'T NEED YOU KNOW I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. BUT IT WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FULLY AWARE OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT. AND THE IMPACT OF THE HAVE ON THE GENERAL PLAN AND SO THAT WILL HELP YOU WEIGH THEM AGAINST YOUR OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITY- HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHICH SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO FIND BASED. ON ITS PRIORITIES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT NCLUDE ANY OF THE PROJECTS THAT YOU'LL BE DISCUSSING IN THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM. FOR THE TWELVE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SLATED TO COME ONLINE IN THE FOUR YEARS AFTER. THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THIS IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DIFFER FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH'S METHODOLOGY AND HOW THEY DID THEIR- REASSESSMENT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEN SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE- MIGHT DEFINE OR WAIVE THE CRITERIA DIFFERENTLY. OR THEY MIGHT THINK THAT ADDITIONAL FACTORS COULD ALSO BE IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT% CONFLICTS ARE COMMON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SO- I THIS IS FOR I THINK THIS FOR FINANCE OR FOR THE- FOR THE BRANCH. CONSOLIDATION OF THE FUNDS SOUNDS ARE REASONABLE AS LA POINTED OUT BUT HOW DOES THE BRANCH INTENT TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL INSOLVENCY ISSUE. OF THE CONSOLIDATED FUND. IN THE OUT YEARS. JUST REMINDED PARTNER FINANCE ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY IS CURRENTLY PLANNED IT THIS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING FOR THE TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND WHERE WE REJECTED BACK FILL FOR THE YEAR AND AT A LATER POINT IN THE IMAGINATION MAKE IT AND JUST MAKE IT BACK FEEL THE FINE TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO BE SOLVING. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR SO REALLY JUST. BE GENERAL FUND BACK INTERACTION. OKAY COLLEAGUES AND QUESTIONS NO QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU THE BILL HOLD OPEN ISSUE SIX THIS IS A CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS. YES MADAM CHAIRMAN THE SYSTEMS LIKE COMPUTER WHICH AGAIN CONGESTION COUNCIL I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW- THIS ISSUE ON HAS A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET YEAR- OF EIGHT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AND SIXTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN LEAST REVENUE BONDS AUTHORITY TO PAY FOR PROJECTS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THEY ARE SPECIFIC.

FARM HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD WOULD LIKE TO MOVE INTO THAT USE AND THAT PROCESS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN A MORE EXPEDITED PROJECT DELIVERY. AND CHEAPER UP PROJECT COSTS AS. COMPARED TO OUR CURRENT DELIVERY METHOD. THANK YOU. OKAY ON ON ISSUE SIX ITSELF- BINANCE PLEASE. FRIEDMAN ROBIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

TO RESPOND ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. GET I IF YOU COULD JUST GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO- WHITE YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT OVER THE CURRENT. DESIGN BID BUILD PROCESS. WHAT LED YOU TO. FROM TO THIS. AND THEN YOU KNOW JUST FOR TO US THE DALLAS MCCORMICK IN JACK AND SEEM TO PROVIDE THAT THE DEEPER AND RESPONSE. HERE'S A MELHOR MIXED AUDIO IS NOT WORKING WILL TURN OVER TO MR SAYING ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THIS IS JACK AND SAME INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL SORT. BUT TARGETED WE HAVE. BOMBINGS SECTION SEVEN THREE NINE ONE SEVEN THE IS WAS LIMITED FOR THE DESIGNS ARE CORRECT METHODOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING IS NOT DESIGNED AND BUILT BY CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS BECAUSE WE HOLD TWO SEPARATE CONTRACTS ONE WITH ARCHITECT OR DESIGN TEAM AND ONE WITH A CONTRACTOR. WHO IS ACTUALLY BUILDING THE PROJECT. THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TWO AND WE THE OWNER TAKES ADDITIONAL RISK BECAUSE OF THE ACT. OF THE ACT IF THERE IS A DESIGN ISSUE WE ARE ON THE HOPE TO GET THAT CORRECTED BUT THE CONTRACTOR BY MOVING TO THE DESIGN BUILD DELIVERY METHOD. WE WOULD ELIMINATE THE ACTRESS THAT WRESTLING SHIFT OVER TO THE DESIGN BUILD AND HE BECAUSE LAW IT WILL BE ON THE CONTRACTOR TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THE CAR IN THE DESIGN BUILD METHODOLOGY THOUGH. THE OWNERS ONLY SOLD CONTRACTORS WITH THE CONTRACTOR AND THE DESIGNERS UNDER THE CONTRACTOR SO THAT IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR SHIFTING- OUR RISK AND REDUCING OUR RISK FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. I WOULD ALSO MENTION BACK. ON ON THE AVERAGE THE DESIGN. IS MUCH MORE FASTER THAN CMR. PROCESS BECAUSE WE CAN DO. THE STOCK MUCH ARE A THE PACKAGES GETTING BY THE CONGRESS AND GET BERMAN BY THE STREETS MARSHALL. WELL WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING IS OUR- RESTORATION OF OUR PREVIOUS AUTHORITY UNDER THE COMMON SECTION CALLED SOME OF THREE NINETY ONE POINT SEVEN. IN WHICH WE WERE LIMITED TO FIVE STATE FACILITIES- WOULD THAT ALSO INCLUDED THE- STATE OFFICE FACILITIES PRISONS AND THE COURSE CELEBRITIES. AND IN THE NEW TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WELL WE ARE GONNA MATTER THAT SEEMS OF PREVIOUS. OF LANGUAGE AND ALSO THE LANGUAGE THAT IS FAR EXECUTIVE BRANCH TWO OF. TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO DESIGN. OKAY- IN JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THAT DOES THIS- CHANGE THE NUMBER PROPOSED. OR COULD IT CHANGE THE NUMBER POLLS AND- IN FUTURE IN THE FUTURE- SO THE CHAIN THE NUMBER OF HURDLES- IT- IT DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT BY TWO EIGHT. THE ONLY WOULD BE THAT WILL BE A TO ACHIEVE SAME ARE. WHICH OF THOSE. ERRORS AND OMISSIONS ROSE BECAUSE SHIP YOU MCCARTY. AND WE WILL HAVE SEEN BECAUSE WE STARTED THE CONSTRUCTION ALREADY ARE STILL THE ESCALATION CALLS TO THE START OF CONSTRUCTION AND THE SOLUTION BECAUSE TO. MAKE PART OF CONSTRUCTION ALL THE RULES ARE VERY USEFUL THE PROJECT SHOULD BE CHEAPER AND RUN MUCH FASTER. SO THE PRODUCTIVITY WILL INCREASE. C. M. CHANGE AND ARE IN THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS. OKAY. THANK COLLEAGUES MANY QUESTIONS NO NOT HERE OKAY- THAT'S THE LAST STRAW THAT'S THE LAST ISSUE ARE I THANK THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN THE FINANCE AND- BOMB L. A. O. OUR STAFF I JUST WANT TO- JUST SAY A FEW THINGS BEFORE WE AND- I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH SENATOR UMBERG CHAIR OF SENATE JUDICIARY AND- WE HAVE SOME SORT OF COMMON. ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN- DISCUSSING RELATED TO EFFICIENCIES AND ALSO TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE OF THE COURT HOUSES- CENTER BERG BEHIND HAVING A JOINT HEARING OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEES ON. ON SOME OF THESE ARE ASPECTS- BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT DOM. I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN THE FISHING SEASON MODERNIZE IN OUR COURTS BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE. ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE HARDEST TIME USING OUR COURTS ARE AND WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEED- GOING TO COURT IS NEVER EASY FOR ANYBODY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF TRAUMA IN THOSE CASES IN THE- WHAT PEOPLE ARE FACING- AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE EFFICIENCY THAT IT'S NOT AT AT THE AT THE RISK OF. OF FURTHER HURTING OR ARE ON THE NINE- ACCESS- AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS LIKE IMMIGRANTS- THOSE IN NEED OF LANGUAGE SERVICES INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IS ARE ALL. SHOULD BE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST AS MUCH AS MODERNIZING IS- IT CAN MEAN. NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN'T MEAN- CANNOT MEAN BETTER ACCESS FOR SOME AND BETTER EFFICIENCY FOR SOME BUT BROUGHT ME IN THE GAP FOR OTHERS AND- I SAY THIS BECAUSE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IN MANY WAYS WERE APPLAUDING- THE REMOTE PROCESS AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE CONTINUOUSLY LEAVE BEHIND PEOPLE ARE IN THAT DIGITAL DIVIDE WHO JUST CANNOT OR DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND I DO WONDER. ARE REITERATE OUR OR- SO WITH MY CALL IN CORTEZ HE SAID ABOUT- EVICTIONS ON THE POTENTIALS OF THESE EVICTIONS ARE WE PREPARED TO HANDLE THE NUMBER OF CASES. AT THE END OF THE OF THE MORATORIUM- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINT WE FIGHT FROM THE CRISIS BUT OUR COURTS WILL OUR COURTS BE IN A POSITION WE EXPECT OUR COURTS TO BE IN A POSITION TO HANDLE THIS. FANDOM FINALLY IS JUST BASED ON THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE- ON THE DEPENDENCY COURTS- I KNOW JUST THE LOS ANGELES COURT SYSTEM CONSISTS OF TWENTY EIGHT CORDS- AND THE LAWYERS DEPENDENCY LAWYERS HANDLE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND LOW INCOME PARENTS ON ANY. ONE GIVEN DAY- A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE CLIENTS ARE WITHIN MY DISTRICT COULD COME PROUD TO REPRESENT THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND THE YOU KNOW THE COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED THAT CASELOADS FOR PARENTS AND- CHILDREN ATTORNEY SHOULD NOT EXCEED A HUNDRED FORTY. CASES PER ATTORNEY- BUT CURRENTLY IT'S OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN CASES PER ATTORNEY AS OUR INFORMATION SHOWS- AND REALLY THEY SHOULD BE AT A HUNDRED CASES PER ATTORNEY. SO I RAISE THAT AS A AS AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T A PARTICULAR. OKAY WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE- AND- AND DISCUSS THOSE ISSUES I THINK NOW WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY WITH MY PERSONAL PUBLIC- OKAY WITH THE- FIND. OKAY HERE WE GO SO- WE'RE GOING OUT TO PUBLIC COMMENT- WE WILL NOW MOVE INTO ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS.

MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS MIKE CARROLL FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING TODAY- I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON ON ITEMS CHIU ON THE ISSUE OF THE SELF HELP CENTERS I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE DISCUSSION THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD BOND FOR REPORTERS I THINK OF SENATOR CORTESE CENTER NEWMAN'S POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN WE REALLY DO NEED TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THEIR ADEQUATE PROVISION OF COURT REPORTERS. IN COURTROOMS AS WE HEAR ALL OF THESE UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE THAT MAY BE COMING WE CANNOT BRING APPEALS LEGAL SERVICE ADVOCATE THAT ONCE WE HAVE A RECORD OF THE HEARING AND IF THERE'S NO COURT REPORTER WE HAVE NO RECORD THAT THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL SOMETHING THAT WE THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THIS YEAR. SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS ITEM FOR YOUR GENDER WHICH DEALS WITH THE ONLINE QUARTERS USE THAT UNIFICATION TRAFFIC COURT PROF. PROGRAMS- WELL APPRECIATE THE ADMIN. EFFORTS TRY TO- ACCESS- ALLOW DO- JUDICATA TAKE ONLINE. I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S REPORT THIS YEAR IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS AN INEQUITY THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE. THE MAPS- IN SOME YOU KNOW PERHAPS MORE LIBERAL COUNTIES IN THE STATE WE ARE SEEN. PRETTY HIGH DISCOUNTS ON THE NUMBER ON HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE GETTING PRODUCTIONS IN THEIR TRAFFIC TICKETS WHEREAS IN OTHER COUNTIES WORSE NOT SEEN THOSE REDUCTIONS. OUR PREFERENCE RANKING WITH EXPRESS IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WOULD BE TO SIMPLY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE FEES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO TRAFFIC FINES WHICH CURRENTLY- THERE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AN ADD ON. TO THESE TRAFFIC TICKETS WE THINK THIS WOULD BE A MORE EQUITABLE APPROACH THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU WOULD GET THOSE DISCOUNTS APPLIED AND NOT HAVE IT BE AT THE DISCRETION. OF JUDGES IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. WE YOU KNOW WE OVERALL ARE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE EXPANSION AT THIS TIME WE DO AGREE T. L. A. ON THAT- BUT WE ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU MINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND A- COMPROMISE. BUT WE DO THINK ON ELIMINATION OF MANY OF THE SPECIES IS THE PROPER APPROACH TO REALLY BRINGING JUSTICE. TO THE TRAFFIC A COURT SITUATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK. YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT ARE NOT COMMON LINE TWELVE LINE WILL TWO THREE TO GO AHEAD. MAY BE CENTERED ON BEHALF OF AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING COURT EMPLOYEES I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PROPOSAL IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AUGMENT TRIAL COURTS OPERATING BUDGET AS WELL AS YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SUCH AUGMENTATION WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE RESTORATION. OF CUTS- VIA LAST YEAR'S TRACKER- WE ARE HOWEVER CONCERNED ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL THIS IS OF ACCOMMODATING AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD RESULTING FROM THE EXPLORATION OF THAT THE AFFECTION MORATORIUM VIA. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. HOUSE SUBSEQUENTLY. THAT NINETY ONE WE WILL IN. OF THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON TOP OF THE ELEVEN POINT SEVEN WILL BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND WHEN THAT BUDGET. DISCRIMINATION IS MADE IT HOT INCLUDES FUNDINGFOR COURT REPORTERS MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN BE DATA CAN BE COMPLIED- WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HEARD ABOUT. WORKERS AND WANT TO THE CEMENT WE DISAGREE IN THE COMMENTS THAT ONE OF THE LEADING MADE REGARDING- THE ISSUE BEING COMPLICATED IT'S NOT COMPLICATED AT ALL MAKING SURE COURT HIGHER SUFFICIENT COURT ORDERS DON'T LET ME OFFICE. BELT FOR AWHILE WENDY AND THAT WE FIND THE- TRIAL COURT TRANSCRIPT INCREASED THAT HASN'T BEEN INCREASED IN THIRTY YEARS IS THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE. GUARANTEE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT ORDERS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. WE HAVE A CALM TO MY TWENTY TO ONE LINE IS A- GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS RIO SHARP I WORK AT THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA- AND WERE INVOLVED IN THE DEBT FREE JUSTICE COALITION AND THE BACK ON THE ROAD COALITION AND I'M PROVIDING PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE ABILITY TO PAY EXPANSION- AND I WOULD URGE YOU ALL TO REJECT THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THE ONLINE TOOL- I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ELIMINATE DOUBLE ATTACHMENT. THOSE LATE FEES BUT OFTEN AMOUNT TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS- OF COURSE WE NEED TO REDUCE THE COST OF COURT FINES AND FEES WERE TOTALLY IN AGREEMENT THERE THERE ARE FAR TOO HIGH BUT THE ONLINE TOOL IS NOT THE BEST APPROACH TO DO THAT- FIRST TOPIC PRIVILEGES THOSE WITH THE WHERE WITH ALL TO GET ONLINE AND COMPLETE THE ONLINE TOOL. FOR THOSE OF AYE TABLE ACCESS DAY MEETING VIRTUALLY TODAY THAT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT IT DOES ACT AS A HURDLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT NEED THAT TOOL FOR USING THAT ONLINE APPROACH TO LOWER CAR. INSURANCE THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO NEED AFFORDABILITY THE MOST WILL NOT RECEIVE AT. THE ONLINE TOOL ALSO HELPS PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT COUNTY DIFFERENTLY IT TENDS TO DO MORE FOR THOSE IN SAN FRANCISCO THAN THOSE IN VENTURA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE- WHY WOULD WE CHOOSE THE STRATEGY PRED DRAFTING COSTS THAT HELP SOME MORE THAN OTHERS THOSE IN TERMS OF GO DON'T DESERVE MORE MERCY THAN THOSE WHO VENTURE OUT. AND WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A STRATEGY THAT'S MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY UNIFORM. THERE'S JUST NO SENSE IN LOADING PEOPLE UP WITH MATH AT THAT FIRST AND THEN OFFERING THEM RELIEF ON THE BACK AND WE NEED FRONT AND REFORM AND FOR THAT REASON WE NEED TO ELIMINATE OF WHAT THAT MEANT. CIVIL ATTACHMENTS ARE AN EXCESSIVE PENALTY EITHER OFTEN THAT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVEN WHEN THE ORIGINAL FINE WITH ONLY TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY DOLLARS- HE CAN BE TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS THE ACTUAL FIND THAT THE LEGISLATORS AFTER THE INFRACTION AND THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS AND UNFAIR. IT WAS OFTEN ALSO HAVE VERY DIVERGENT A FAX FROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THOSE COMMUNITIES LEAST ABLE TO PAY THEIR FINES PROMPTLY ARE THOSE MOST. LIKELY TO BE HAD WITH THE FROM NORMAL AND NORMA'S FINE. AND THE CAN. FACE THE MOST. TO APPEAR IN COURT. ARE THE MOST TO GET DIVORCED. SO WOULD YOU KNOWS. THAT LLOWING PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE FACING THE HIGHEST RATE THE WHAT THAT MEANT. IF YOU HAVE CASH YOU THE FINE PRINT OF THE AT THAT. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE CASH. AVAILABLE OR HAVE TROUBLE GETTING TO COURT YOU CAN EXPECT TO BE FINED HEAVILY FOR THAT. IT'S JUST NOT A FAIR EQUITABLE PRACTICE AND IT'S ONE WE SHOULD AND- ANYWAY SHOT THAT WILL HAPPENED DOESN'T ALLOW. WITH OUR CURRENT EFFORT ADVANCE. IN THE COURTS SO PLEASE CONSIDER. INSTEAD OF MOVING FORWARD ON THAT ONLINE EDUCATION TOOL I TAKE THE WILL POWER THAT YOU HAVE TO REDUCE COSTS AND INCREASE AFFORDABILITY. AND TAKE THE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON IT. AND REALLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ELIMINATE DOUBLE EFFECT MEANT BASS BACK THE WAY TO. ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU ON AFFORDABILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.
