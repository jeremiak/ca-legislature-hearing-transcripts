THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT BRANDS CONNECTED OVER VIDEO OF OFF MICROPHONE. I HAVE HEARD YEAH MICROPHONE IS OFF. THE BOTTOM LINE TRANSIT.

SO MISTER WHITE CALCIUM TO TURN BACK TO YOU YEAH I WAS ONE TEST CENTER WINNER ABOUT THE WORKLOAD IMPACT ON THE COURTS THE FEE THERE'S NOTHING SAID DURING THE- DISCUSSION IN THE WITNESSES IT SEEMS LIKE THIS POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT AND GIVEN THE CUTS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ON THE ON THE COURTS- IT MAY PUT PRESSURE GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE- COURT PERSONNEL TO DEAL WITH. ALL THESE DISPUTES CAN YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT WELL I ACTUALLY THINK THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HUGE THE CITY ITSELF IF WE DON'T ACT AND PUT A STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES CLOSED DOWN THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF LITIGATION. AGAINST THE OWNERS OF BUSINESSES TO COLLECT YOU KNOW RAN OVER ETCETERA ETCETERA ETCETERA SO I DON'T SO THERE WILL BE WITHOUT THIS BILL THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION I'M I THINK OF ANYTHING THAT THIS FIVE BILL WILL REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF LITIGATION COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT THIS BILL AND I KNOW SOMETIMES THIS COMMITTEE YOU HAVE THE LOOK AT THE KEY CREATED WITHOUT THE CALL OF WITH AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S SO OBVIOUS RESULT. IN REDUCED COST PRESSURE ON A IN MAY EVEN DECREASE OF A PRESS. ALL RIGHT I SHARE THE SAME CONCERN THE MISTER Y. CASKEY- DOES END OF THE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW MENTIONED AS AN UNKNOWN. COST PRESSURE AT THIS POINT SO OBVIOUSLY STE MISTER WINNER WHEN YOU AND I TALKED WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT I KNOW WE HAVE A- YEAH AND WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED- AND THE CONSTITUTIONALITY TO I THINK- OBVIOUSLY- SOMETHING I'M GONNA WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND THEN PSIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE PROPOSING THE SOONER YOU GET THOSE TO STAFF THE BETTER TODAY. TODAY IT WILL GET THE MOCK UP TODAY AND THEN THE COUNCIL DRAFTED WILL BE LATER BUT THE MOUTH OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THE SOONER THE BETTER WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WE CAN WE CAN ANALYZE THEM IN RELATION TO WHAT THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE UP TO THIS POINT. A MISTAKE SHE WANTED TO- MAKE A COMMENT A YES THANK YOU A- PORTANTINO. THIS HAS TO DO WITH A REQUEST THAT ARE FISCAL STAFF- PLEASE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WELL IN ADVANCE. OF THE HEARING SO WE COULD BE PREPARED TO. HEAR THE FISCAL IMPACTS SIDE TODAY- WE WERE TOLD THAT FINANCE WOULD NOT HAVE A FILE WE ALSO ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO ATTEND TODAY'S HEARING. BE PREPARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THIS ISABOUT FISCAL IMPACT. AS IT RELATES TO STATE PROPERTIES SO WHERE WE HAVE LEASES. IDG EFFORT BY SAYS IT WOULD NOT LIKELY BE ABLE TO GET APPROVAL FROM ADMINISTRATION TO A TOWN. BOB THIS IS FOR YOU KNOW MISSILE DISTURBING ESPECIALLY AT THESE TIMES WE HAVE THESE KIND OF AMENDED SORT OF EDITED HEARINGS. DGL FOR ADVICE THEY PABLE TO GET APPROVAL. CANCEL WERE FRUSTRATED THAT WE CANNOT GET TIMELY INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. EVEN ASK OF. OUR EVEN WHEN WE ASK FOR IT IN ADVANCE. AND IT CERTAINLY HAS AN ISSUE REGARDING OUR STATE PROPERTIES AND I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED I WAS I WAS SIGNED A JOINT GREEK. JOINING US SO. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST ON THE RECORD THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AN APARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. ALONG WITH OUR STATE PARKS. PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE COST IMPACTS. IN THE WORKLOAD IMPACTS THE BILL WILL HAVE WHILE IT IS ON SIXPENCE. THING AND I JUST LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF AN EQUATION WE HAVE THOSE WHO. OWN PROPERTIES HAVE FISCAL. ARE SIGNIFICANT WITH THOSE PROPERTIES MORTGAGES. PROPERTY TAXES AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAST FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THERE A POSSIBILITY BUT THEY ALSO HAVE. PRESSURES WE KNOW IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GENERATE REVENUES. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANTIQUATED AND IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE BALANCED ON BOTH SIDES. AND I SAID. THAT WE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR. HIS VERY A RETROACTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT ON ONE SIDE OF THE OF. XIN THAT'D BE GRANTED TO THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WOULD MEAN. OF REMOVING THE RECORD. ON GET FOR. ON TARGET. FOR THIS SAME L&LT;C.CYAN&GT;G OF TIME AND ALSO&LT;/C&GT; WITH NO PENALTIES TO. AND ALSO PRO TAX OF HALF BE CAN. THAT'S A HUGE A- TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IMPACTS THERE. SO THOSE ARE JUST COMMENTS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND WE GO FORWARD. ARE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE WITH THIS BILL TO CERTAINLY HELP. BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION BECAUSE THEY ARE CERTAINLY EXTREMELY VITAL TO THE RECOVERY OF OUR ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BATES- OBVIOUSLY I'LL CHECK IN WITH THE- APPROACH STAFF AS WELL TO SEE WHAT THE STATUS OF YOUR REQUESTS ARE AND SEE WHAT INFORMATION WE CAN- WE CAN GET TO AID IN. GETTING THE PUBLIC PROPERTY IMPACTS THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY MISTER WINNER OF IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOTHES ARE. OBVIOUSLY PLEASE DO AND THEN WE'LL KEEP GOING. BUT OF IT TO CLOSE NOW- THANK YOU MS APARTMENT FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE- BUT WE ARE GOING TO DRILL DOWN ON HIS BATES CONCERNS YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND WE WERE WE WALKING A CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY INTO AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS BILL ON BOTH SIDES- AND WE HAVE THE RULES THIS THREE EXTREMELY OPPOSED AND THEN WE HAVE. MANY SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE COMING TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND ASKING FOR A LIFELINE ALERT FIND THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE RIGHT NOW AND I RESPECTFULLY. IT'S SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC MELTDOWN WELL RESPECTFULLY WE ARE IN AN ECONOMIC MELTDOWN NOW AND IF WE DON'T THROW A LIFELINE TO THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHO ARE AT RISK SEVERE RISK OF PERMANENT CLOSURE. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR A LONG TERM ECONOMIC MELTDOWN BECAUSE WE KNOW SMALL BUSINESS IS ARE ARE THE CORE OF OUR JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE VIBRANCY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS- IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY A PROCEDURE IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THINGS LIKE CONSTITUTIONALITY. ACTUALLY DID AN EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THANK INCLUDED THAT THIS BILL IS VERY DEFENSIBLE FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE SOMEONE CAN ALWAYS CHALLENGE OF COURSE HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT. BUT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE POLICY COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THIS IS A VERY DEFENSIBLE BILL CONSTITUTIONALLY WE ARE IN A UNIQUE- HEALTH PANDEMIC. THAT IS THREATENING MASSIVE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY AS A LEGISLATURE- TO ADDRESS THAT. AS I NOTED- WE ARE GOING TO REMOVE THE LEASE TERMINATION PROVISION REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING SOFTER- WE ARE TRYING TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. ON IN TERMS OF LOAN DEFAULTS BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN MEANT. NONE OF US WANTS ANY OF THESE LANDLORDS LARGE OR SMALL TO GO INTO FAULT OR FORECLOSURE- AND TO SENATOR BATES I WOULD LOVE TO ALSO ADDRESS THE MORTGAGE ISSUES AND BUILT. GIVEN THE FEATHER JURY OVER SO MANY THE MORE IS THERE. REGULATE IT'S HARD ENOUGH SPLIT. FEDERAL AND STATE SO WE ARE DOING A WE TIME BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN. THE IT IS NOT CASE. THAT THESE. LANDLORDS ARE JUST PEACHY KEEN RIGHT EVERY IS ALL GOOD EVERYONE'S PAYING THEIR RENT AND YOU KNOW SCOTT WIENER LEANING AND SALAS COME ALONG AND SAY WE THINK THEY SHOULD PAY REDUCE RIGHT. THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RENT OVERWHELMINGLY RIGHT NOW. AND SO THIS BILL DISAPPEAR TOMORROW IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WOULD BE COLLECTING FOR RENT. THOSE BUSINESSES ARE JUST GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THE CHOICE FOR SO MANY OF THESE LANDLORDS IS NOT. DO YOU GET FOR RENT OR REDUCED RAN. IT'S DO YOU GET REDUCED RIGHT OR NO RENT YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE BLOOD FROM A TURNIP THESE BUSINESSES ARE JUST GOING TO CLOSE. DOWN SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THERE'S NO RISK OF LOAN DEFAULT ALARIC WE'RE CREATING I THINK QUITE. THE OPPOSITE- I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN IN CLOSING- THAT. AS FAR AS WE KNOW THIS IS THE ONLY BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO TRY TO ADDRESS WHAT IS WHATEVER ONE'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS A VERY REAL ISSUE. IN TERMS OF THE THREAT OF A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND PARTICULARLY OUR SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESSES. AND COMMUNITY SERVING NONPROFITS THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT I KNOW OF IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THAT. THIS IS THE VEHICLE. IT IS ON A COMPRESSED TIMELINE LIKE ALL COOPER BILLS. WE'VE ALREADY MADE AND WILL CONSIDER AND ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO WHAT WE KNOW IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS WE WILL WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND I'M ASKING- THAT WITH THAT IF THIS COMES OFF SUSPENSE AND I HOPE IT WILL THAT WOULD BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CENTER. TO FORMULATE A BILL THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH. THAT THROWS A LIFELINE TO THESE ESSENTIAL SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS COMES OUT SUSPENSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MAYOR I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU WELL IT'S SUSPEND TO HAVE THOSE CON.
