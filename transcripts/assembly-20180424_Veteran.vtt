CHAIR.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:32.545 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU ARE AWARE. IN TWO

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:34.814 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:36.716 region:rollup2
CREATED A VETERANS DESIGNATIONS

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:38.718 region:rollup2
ON DRIVER'S LICENSES AND STATE

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:40.620 region:rollup2
ID CARDS. AND SINCE THEN HAS

00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:42.755 region:rollup2
BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.023 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. EYES HAD A AN

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:45.891 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE ACTUALLY

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:48.027 region:rollup2
รณ NEARLY A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:48.661 region:rollup2
THAT APPLY FOR THAT DESIGNATION

00:18:48.027 --> 00:18:50.229 region:rollup2
FIND THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:51.697 region:rollup2
VETERANS BENEFITS THAT THEY DID

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:54.100 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW ABOUT. AND THAT IS LED

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:56.369 region:rollup2
TO OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.070 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY. AND I IN RECEIPTS TO

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:58.771 region:rollup2
THOSE VETERANS SO I JUST KIND OF

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.307 region:rollup2
A A TOOL.

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:03.809 region:rollup2
PURPOSE TO THAT PROGRAM HAS

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.410 region:rollup2
BEEN A SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WAY.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.878 region:rollup2
.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.046 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE PARTICIPATION

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.981 region:rollup2
RATE IN THAT PROGRAM IS STILL

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:10.716 region:rollup2
VERY LOW LESS THAN TEN PERCENT

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:13.019 region:rollup2
OF VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:14.120 region:rollup2
APPLIED FOR THIS DESIGNATION AND

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:15.554 region:rollup2
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.223 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FEE ATTACHED TO. THE

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:19.458 region:rollup2
DESIGNATION IT'S ONLY FIVE

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:20.259 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BUT IT IS AN IMPEDIMENT.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.194 region:rollup2
SO LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.829 region:rollup2
QUIRK SILVA AUTHORED LEGISLATION

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:25.197 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD EXEMPT LOW INCOME ON

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.499 region:rollup2
HOMELESS VETERANS FROM HAVING TO

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.933 region:rollup2
PAY THAT FEE AND THIS BILL

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.935 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE. BUILDS

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:31.504 region:rollup2
ON THAT SUCCESS BY EXEMPTING

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.638 region:rollup2
SENIOR CITIZENS WHO ARE ALSO

VETERANS FROM HAVING TO PAY THE

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:36.008 region:rollup2
FEE SO THE HOPE IS THAT THIS IS

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.443 region:rollup2
GOING TO LEAD TO. A HIGHER

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.778 region:rollup2

AND THEN RESERVE JUDGMENT ON THE

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:13.652 region:rollup2

COMMITMENT THAT I MADE THAT

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:23.529 region:rollup2
MATTERS A LOT MORE TO ME THAN A

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.163 region:rollup2
YES OR A NO VOTE. UNDERSTAND AND

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:30.703 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:31.570 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

00:24:30.703 --> 00:24:35.341 region:rollup2
ALL RIGHT.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.575 region:rollup2
WE STILL DO NOT OH YES.

00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:38.844 region:rollup2
STIR VOEPEL NOT QUITE SURE WHAT

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:40.379 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:41.747 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TELL

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:43.916 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HERE THAT THIS IS A

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:46.852 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD BILL.

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:48.954 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS.

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:50.723 region:rollup2
MANY OF US VETERANS RECEIVE

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:52.658 region:rollup2
DISCOUNTS

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:54.760 region:rollup2
ONE WE SHOW OUR VETERANS

00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:57.363 region:rollup2
DRIVER'S LICENSE WITH VETERANS

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.697 region:rollup2
ON IT THAT'S OUR ID.

00:24:57.363 --> 00:25:01.066 region:rollup2
YOU GET TEN PERCENT OFF AT

00:24:58.697 --> 00:25:04.436 region:rollup2
LOWE'S YOU GET.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:06.839 region:rollup2
PERCENTS OFF AT HOME DEPOT.

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:07.940 region:rollup2
VETERANS AT THE AIRPORT GET TEN

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:10.342 region:rollup2
PERCENT OFF OF WHAT THEY

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.379 region:rollup2
PURCHASE AT MOST PLACES

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:15.147 region:rollup2

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.782 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TEN PERCENT FIFTEEN

00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:19.318 region:rollup2

00:25:26.158 --> 00:25:30.295 region:rollup2

DRIVERS LICENSE

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:34.633 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY.

00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:36.435 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:39.338 region:rollup2
HOMELESS VETERANS LOW INCOME

00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:40.539 region:rollup2
VETERANS VETERANS ON DISABILITY.

00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:42.841 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE A HUNDRED PERCENT

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:44.743 region:rollup2
DISABLED VETERAN YOU ONLY GET

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:46.745 region:rollup2

BARELY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON.

00:25:48.414 --> 00:25:52.684 region:rollup2
SO THESE DISCOUNTS AND THIS ID

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:54.853 region:rollup2
IS WORTH IT LITERALLY WORTH IT'S

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:56.722 region:rollup2
WEIGHT IN GOLD. AND IT CAN

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:58.624 region:rollup2

THIS IS AN EXAMPLE BUT I ALSO

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:32.711 region:rollup2
HAD ANOTHER.

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:35.047 region:rollup2
HOMELESS BILL FOR A FEE WAIVER

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:37.549 region:rollup2

DMV'S OUT WHEN IT WAS AND

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:40.419 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEE ANNABEL THERE

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:43.021 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SHE. WAS A WILL.

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:44.423 region:rollup2
ON OUR TEAM AT THAT POINT WE

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:46.391 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT

WAS A RESTRICTION.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.959 region:rollup2
THIS WILL GIVE ANOTHER

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.060 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO COME IN

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:24.429 region:rollup2

.

00:36:09.234 --> 00:36:12.637 region:rollup2
BALLOT SAID ON THIS BECAUSE YOU

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:26.985 region:rollup2
THERE FOR MEDICAL CARE.

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:28.553 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT REALLY THERE FOR.

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:31.056 region:rollup2
.

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:31.256 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE.

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:34.125 region:rollup2
AND.

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:35.760 region:rollup2
AND ORIGINALLY ONE YACHT DOES

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.261 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.429 region:rollup2
WAS SEEN AS THIS COMMAND

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:40.198 region:rollup2
ELEMENT.

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:42.200 region:rollup2
BUT WE STATUS ARE GONE FORWARD.

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:43.735 region:rollup2
WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR YOM WILL

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.303 region:rollup2
GET THE SAME AS ADMINISTRATOR

AND BEEN TERM TAKES CARE OF A

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:49.040 region:rollup2
COUPLE HUNDRED VETERANS.

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:50.575 region:rollup2
AND SO CLEARLY THAT THE PAY

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.544 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT.

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:53.878 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE REQUIREMENT OVERSIGHT

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:56.047 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT THE PAY STRUCTURES

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:57.215 region:rollup2
SAME AND THE SKILL LEVELS COMING

00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.716 region:rollup2

00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:00.385 region:rollup2
ONE TO SAME SKILL LEVEL

00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:02.921 region:rollup2
INVENTOR.

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:04.355 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A NEW FACILITY SO.

00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:06.157 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:08.026 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT DEBT

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:09.727 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULD PUT SOME

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:12.430 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SECRETARY.

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:14.065 region:rollup2
SO HOW DID HOUSES SECRETARY.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.633 region:rollup2
DISALLOWED THE SECRETARY AND HIS

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.468 region:rollup2
STAFF TO.

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:18.336 region:rollup2
AND SURE THAT WE SPEND THE MONEY

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.738 region:rollup2
WISELY.

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:21.106 region:rollup2
I DO KNOW THAT THEY JUST

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:22.240 region:rollup2
RECENTLY HIRED A GENTLEMAN THIS

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:23.575 region:rollup2
CAN BE WORKING ON THE

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.110 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:26.377 region:rollup2
AT THE SITE I'M I THINK THAT'S

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.680 region:rollup2
A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:30.849 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD NUMEROUS NUMEROUS

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.383 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEETINGS UP AT THE.

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:33.918 region:rollup2
AT THE SITE.

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:35.386 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S OUR

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.821 region:rollup2
NEXT STEP SHOULD BE. AND THERE'S

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.589 region:rollup2
BEEN A MASTER PLAN THAT'S BEEN

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.990 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:40.458 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME FUNDING

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.926 region:rollup2
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH A

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.494 region:rollup2
NEW. FACILITY.

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.062 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:45.797 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS THAT LIVE THERE THAT%

00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:47.332 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CITY LIVING IN SINGLE

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:49.434 region:rollup2
BEDROOMS NOT HAVING TO SHARE

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:51.536 region:rollup2
WITH OTHERS. SO THERE'S A LOT TO

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:52.203 region:rollup2
GO ON OF ITS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.172 region:rollup2
CARE OF THEIR.

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:55.673 region:rollup2

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:05.683 region:rollup2
OUR RESIDENTS GET THE BEST OF

CARE. AND.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:08.520 region:rollup2
IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO ME IS

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:10.855 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.358 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME UP THERE

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:14.526 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AND I THINK WE CAN ALL

00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:15.727 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER TO GET THIS PLACE

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:18.796 region:rollup2
BACK ON HIS FEET.

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:20.331 region:rollup2
IT IS A GEM FOR A NAPA COUNTY

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:22.133 region:rollup2
IN AS WELL AS FOR THE RESIDENTS

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:24.235 region:rollup2

A STATE SAFE PLACE TO WORK AND

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:27.505 region:rollup2

WHAT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER?

00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:48.786 region:rollup2
COMES FROM THE PANEL.

00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:50.321 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY TO BE SO LONG WINDED

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:52.257 region:rollup2
TODAY BUT DO AFTER TOURING THE

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.892 region:rollup2
FACILITY IN AGAIN YOU MENTIONED

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:55.226 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE ARE DOUBLED UP HAVE

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:56.661 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEEN BETTER DORM ROOMS

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:58.129 region:rollup2
IN UC'S AND I HAVE FOR THE FOR

00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:59.330 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW IT AND AGAIN IT ALMOST

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.100 region:rollup2

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:03.534 region:rollup2
THE OLD JAILS.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.736 region:rollup2
HOW WE WE STACK THEM LIKE CORD

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:06.271 region:rollup2

THEY DESERVE BETTER? AND.

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:09.574 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO

00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:09.774 region:rollup2
BE A CONCENTRATION ALSO HOW WE

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:12.877 region:rollup2

ONE IDEA TO CHANGE A CULTURE I

00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:20.285 region:rollup2
