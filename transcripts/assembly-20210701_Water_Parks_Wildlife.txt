A THRIVING ECOLOGICAL BALANCE IN CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S BIO DIVERSITY GOALS AND DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES FOR ACHIEVING THAT BALANCE. WILD HORSES AND BURROS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S. MAJESTIC NATURAL SCENERY HOWEVER THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT. IS DECEMBER DISSEMINATING WILD HORSE AND BURRO POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH EXCESSIVE ROUNDUPS. THESE ROUNDUPS ARE CARRIED OUT USING HELICOPTERS WHICH OFTEN RESULTS AND SEPARATED HERDS AND THE DEATH AND INJURY OF MULTIPLE HORSES. ONCE THE HORSES ARE ROUNDED UP THEY ARE LOCKED UP IN A CORRAL AND SOLD OFF FOR AS LITTLE AS A DOLLAR A DAY AND THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT'S ADOPTION PROGRAM IS EVEN PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO TAKE THE HORSES WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT. THE NEW YORK TIMES INVESTIGATION DONE EARLIER THIS YEAR FOUND THAT CAPTURED WILD HORSES ARE SOLD OFF. AND OFTEN END UP IN SLAUGHTER HOUSES IN CANADA AND MEXICO.

AT THAT TIME CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE WILD FREE ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS ACT. THE ACT DECLARED THAT WILD FREE ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS ARE LIVING BEEN BOLD OF THE HISTORIC AND PIONEER SPIRIT OF THE WET. THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE FORMS WITHIN THE NATION AND ENRICH THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THAT THESE COURSES IN BOROUGHS ARE FAST DISAPPEARING FROM THE AMERICAN TEAM.

FIND US ON OF MINE IT'S NOT A QUESTION IS- MORE I'LL BE OPPOSING THIS TODAY- IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY IN THE DEVIL'S GARDEN REGION OF MODOC COUNTY. AND THE REALITY IS THESE ARE WILD HORSES AND BURROS ARE NOT NATIVE. TO MY REGION AND THEY ACT AS AN INVASIVE SPECIES IN THE ECOSYSTEM OF DEVIL'S GARDEN. SO I'M CURRENTLY THE HERD POPULATION IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND 50% ABOVE THE SUSTAINABLE. SUSTAINABLE FOR THAT LANDSCAPE THE OVER POPULATION- RESULT IN LACK OF VEGETATION AND GRAZING ON WATER AND LEAVE THESE ANIMALS MOUNT NEW MALAMUTE. NISH NOURISHED ACCUSE ME AND SICKLY.

IT WOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY ALLOWING OUR STATE AGENCIES PERSONAL IN THIS VERY SHARP AND DUNGENESS CRAB. AS YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE HARDSHIPS% FISHERMEN FACED IN RESPONDING TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY IS A PROPER STATE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY HARDSHIPS IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WITH THE LOSS OF MULTIPLE FISHING VESSELS ON THE WEST COAST IN RECENT YEARS TAKING ACTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE SAFETY FOR BOTH BAFFLED AND CREW IS PARAMOUNT. AND INCREASED PRESO PERIOD FOR THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY IN THE CENTRAL COAST OF CALIFORNIA WILL ENSURE THAT FISHERMEN ARE AFFORDED THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEPLOY THEIR GEAR IN RESPONSE TO VARIABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS. DISTINCT CREASE FLEXIBILITY ROOM FOR IMPROVED SAFETY AND COULD EVEN SAVE LIVES. SB EIGHTY PROVIDES SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN VETTED AND RECOMMENDED TO US BY THE DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE A LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED BODY. CAPTURED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

OPS ARE DRAWN TO DON GONZALEZ YES. YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THIS PROCEED. RIGHT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- JERRY GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN GONZALEZ AND I'M POLICY SPECIALIST FOR FISHERY THE PACIFIC SEAFOOD GROUP. PACIFIC SEAFOOD GROUP IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED SEAFOOD HARVESTING PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY WE ARE A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER EIGHTY YEARS AND WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY OVER FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT OUR LOCATIONS IN EUREKA SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES. I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAB ASSOCIATION AND I REPRESENT THEM AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING YOU'RE WORKING GROUP. BACK ON MARCH FIFTH WE SUBMITTED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL EIGHTY MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE OBLITERATION COMPONENT OF BILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SOME PRODUCTION OPPORTUNITIES AT A TIME. WHERE IT WOULD CURRENTLY BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO. BUT THEN AN AMENDMENT WAS ADDED ON APRIL SIX THAT WOULD APPLY FAIR START TO DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM. I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE MY OPPOSITION TO THIS FIRST PART PROVISIONS. IT SEEMS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION OPTION THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE PRODUCTION OPPORTUNITIES ON ONE HAND. WHILE HAVING A FAIR START PROVISION THAT SEVERELY LIMITS PRODUCTION OPPORTUNITIES ON THE OTHER HAND. THAT RESULTS IN A NET LOSS FOR THE CRAB HISTORY THAT IS ALREADY OVER REGULATED. OUR CALIFORNIA DOESN'T CRAPPIE FISHERY IS NOW MANAGED BY THE RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM WHICH HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN DEVASTATING. NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT SPORT FISHERMEN ARE PROFITING PLANTS OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. THE LAST THING OUR FISHERY NEEDS IS FOR MORE REGULATIONS SUCH AS A FAIR START PROVISION THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW FISHERMEN TO GO WHERE THE CROWDS ARE. THE FLAG CRAB SEASON WAS ONE OF THE WORST WE HAVE SEEN IN DECADES. THE CRAB SIMPLY WERE NOT THERE AND IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT THE FISHERMEN. CAN BE NOBLE AND MOVE AROUND. IT IF THAT THEY'RE START PROVISION WAS IN PLACE FLAT FEE AND- IT WOULD HAVE HAD. MORE DEVASTATING NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS CORPORATE SHERMAN ARE PROCESSING PLANTS AND OUR EMPLOYEES. AND OF COURSE OUR TO BOOK OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. SIMPLY PUT FISHERMEN NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO WHERE THE CROWDS ARE. GOING CLOTHING WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON SB EIGHTY UNTIL THE FAIR STARTLING WHICH IS REMOVED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL- NOW ASK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS THAT WANTS TO SPEAK UP. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. I SEE NO ONE ANYONE IN THE TELECONFERENCE ROOM. I SEE NO ONE THERE. ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES THIS MODERATOR TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTY PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. BLIND FIFTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. SORRY THIS IS TIFFANY MOCK- ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY ON BEHALF OF OCEANIA THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION THANK YOU. AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTY THANK YOU ARE PRETTY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. IT WAS A MADE BY MR BIGELOW AND THIS RUBIO- THE DRY CLOTHES ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR- COMMENTS FROM ANYONE ON THE- COMMITTEE. SEVEN NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TWELVE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR I'LL DO THIS IN THIRTY SECONDS LONG STORY SHORT I THINK THE WORLD THE SUPERVISOR HIM ISN'T HE DOES INCREDIBLE WORK AND WE HAVE DONE OUR COUNTY THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE THESE RAM BREAKS IN THIS BILL. IS BECAUSE THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDED ON A SEVENTEEN TO THREE VOTE THIS IS AN OMNIBUS BILL I AM A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN CALL THE- QUESTION HERE. AT SECTOR. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO HEALTH COMMITTEE. EDUARDO GARCIA BY EDUARDO GARCIA AYE DOLLY AYE DOLLY AYE BENNETT BIGELOW BIGELOW AYE FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I KALRA. KALRA I. LEVINE LEVINE AYE MURATSUCHI MERE CG I KNOW WHEN I RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS. SALAS AYE AYES SMITH SMITH FIVE IF WE DO IT VIA VIDEO AYE WARD. ALL RIGHT WILL DO THE FOLLOW UP IN A ROLL CALL FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO SIGN UP. WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. MISTER JONES SB FOUR SEVENTY HAVE A TO PASS RECOMMENDATION YOU'LL DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES THAT WILL BE- ONE CALLING IN ONE IN PERSON- PLEASE- PUSHING INFORMATION ON THE FLOOR READY FOR YOUR- L. WE HAVE A SECOND BY MR BIGELOW PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PROCEDURE- ALLOW ME TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOR SEVENTY TODAY WHICH CREATES A COMBINATION HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE WHICH WOULD BE VALID FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA ONLY ALLOWS UNTING AND FISHING LICENSES TO BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY HOWEVER MANY OTHER STATES INCLUDING OUR NEIGHBORING STATES OF OREGON ARIZONA NEVADA OFFER ANNUAL COMBINATION LICENSES. THESE LICENSES HAVE PROVEN POPULAR BY MANY SPORTS MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THAT BOTH HUNT AND FISH IN THE SAME YEAR. SENATE BILL FOR SEVENTY WILL BRING THIS COMBINATION LICENSING OPTION TO THE SPORTSMAN IN CALIFORNIA BY ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO BOTH HUNT AND FISH THE COMBINATION LICENSE OR SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND REACTIVATION EFFORTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- SUPPORT TODAY AND I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES- TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. WE NEED TO BE A PROFESSOR MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU HAVE A WITNESS ON THE PHONE MARK HENLEY FROM CLIFORNIA WATER FELL HE'S THE LEAD AUGUST SECOND. ALL RIGHT SIR. THIS MODERATOR. LOOKING FOR MISTER HENLEY'S LINE UNLESS HE DIALED IN AS A PARTICIPANT. MISTER HENLEY IS NOT CONNECTED. RIGHT WE CAN GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT. OKAY MARC SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN AND ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WATER FELL ON BEHALF OF MISTER HENLEY WHOSE- NOT FOUND AT THIS MOMENT SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION THIS DRIVES OUT OF THE R. THREE PROCESS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS IT'S RECRUIT REACTIVATE AND RETAIN. IT'S A CONCEPT OF GETTING MORE CALIFORNIANS INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF ANGLING AND HUNTING AND OUTDOOR RECREATION PURSUITS THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE LICENSE REVENUES GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE AS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT IS LARGER THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IT'S IN PART DUE TO THE FACT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE WE SELL A MILLION FEWER FISHING LICENSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAN WE DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR POPULATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COASTAL WATERS THREE THOUSAND MILES OF INLAND RIVERS AND ENDLESS OPPORTUNITY. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT LICENSES AS PRODUCTS IN THE STORE WE HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE AND UPDATE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME SO THAT THE CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASE THEM ARE INTERESTED IN THEM THIS GOES ALONG WITH MOVING TOWARDS ELECTRONIC LICENSING THIS GOES TOWARDS CREATING OPTIONS FOR CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS PROVIDE REVENUE TO THE STATE AND PARTICIPATE IN OUTDOOR PASTIMES. I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY SAW AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE TAKING THEIR KIDS FISHING CORRECT GRADING IN THE OUTDOORS WE'RE TRYING HUNTING ARCHERY THOSE KINDS OF SPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT WE WANT TO BRING THIS REVENUE BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR LANDS HELP THEM WORK WITH HUNTER CONSERVATIONISTS AND THIS MEASURE IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND MARK ANALLY IS ONLINE MARK PLEASE GO AHEAD. GREAT HELLO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ITS MARKETING WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL- OUR CURRENT HUNTING AND FISHING SYSTEM IS BASICALLY OUTDATED AS COMPARED WITH OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA OFFERS RELATIVELY FEW TYPES OF HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSES AND ONLY A HANDFUL OF CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO OUR LICENSING SYSTEM IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS- LICENSE SALES WHICH TOTALED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. BUT DECLINED OVER THAT TIME PERIOD DESPITE THE RECENT UPTICK IN REVENUES DURING THE CALVET ENDEMIC THIS DECLINE NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE STRUCTURAL REVENUE AND BALLOT. H. BY THE WITHOUT DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE BUT IT HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT. AND NOT OTHER CONTRA ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED THROUGH LICENSE SALES. SB FOUR SEVENTY WOULD CREATE A NEW COMBINATION HUNTING AND FISHING LIFE AND- SIMILAR TO WHAT ABOUT FORTY OTHER STATES HAVE- AS NOTED- OUR NEIGHBORING OREGON ABOUT AND- ARIZONA THOSE STATE I HAVE THESE TYPES LICENSES. THE BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE LIGHT TO BE VALID THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE A CHANGE WHICH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO ADOPTED. THIS WOULD FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF LICENSE BUYERS TO MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE LICENSE. IN ADDITION- LICENSE BUYERS WOULD BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF AUTO RENEWAL- DURING THAT DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE- HUNTING RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND REACTIVATION OUR PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT FOCUSED ON LIFE AND IN SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF A COMBINATION HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE. THERE WAS ALSO- AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NATIONAL STUDY THAT ASK WHY- THEY WILDLIFE PROFESSIONALS SUGGEST INTERCEPTS FACTORS THAT MIGHT HAVE. AFFECTED LICENSE FAILED IN THEIR STATE. OF THE STATE THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES THAT WERE POLLED IN THE SURVEY. UP FROM TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT- NAMED LICENSE. TYPE CHANGES AS A FACTOR AFFECTING THEIR ULTIMATE LICENSE SALES INCREASE SO WE KNOW THAT THAT IF YOU TYPES OF LICENSES ARE MARKETED APPROPRIATELY. THEY CAN SUCCEED. SO BY OFFERING GREATER CHOICE COMPLEX BILL YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE SEVENTY WOULD HELP TO INCREASE FUNDING FISHING LICENSE SALES AND OF COURSE THE CONSERVATION FUNDING BENEFITS THAT THEY PROVIDE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU.

YOUR PRESENTATION. FOR THE MOTION WHICH BIGELOW SECOND BY MRS SALAS AGAIN YOU DO HAVE A FEW PASSED RECOMMENDATION. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE 2% SB FIVE FIVE NINE THE STATE WATER RESILIENCY ACT. LAST SESSION I INTRODUCED A BILL OF THE SAME NUMBER THAT REQUESTED FUNDING TO RESTORE THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE FRANKLIN CANAL. THAT BILL WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT STARTED A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED TO REPAIR MUCH NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT CAN BETTER PREPARE US FOR OUR WATER NEEDS AND DROUGHT AND NON DROUGHT YEARS. THIS CONVERSATION WAS CHAMPION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT CENTER FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE IN CONGRESSMAN COST AS OFFICE. THEY CONTINUE TO LEAD THIS CONVERSATION TODAY WHAT THE FEDERAL ASK THAT MEMBERS ASK AYE BRING BEFORE YOU TO LAY OUT A PLAN FOR FULLY FUNDING. CANNELLA CONVEYANCE REPAIRS ON THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT THE DELTA MENDOTA CANAL THE SAN LUIS CANAL AND THE FRANK KERN CANAL. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY TELLING YOU ABOUT A SMALL TOWN IN MY DISTRICT A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST AND- TODAY THOMASTON HAS BEEN WITHOUT WATER FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS. TO RESIDENT OF THE TOWN OF SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT RELY ON WATER FROM THE CANALS TO RECHARGE ITS GROUND WATER AQUIFERS. IT'S LOCATED BELOW THE PINCH POINT OR WERE THE SUBSIDENCE ON THE FRANKLIN CANAL IS AT ITS WORST. AND AS A RESULT LOST OUT ON THE WATER IT COULD HAVE USED FOR RECHARGE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE WELL IN THIS TOWN IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING AND THEY ARE HAVING TO TRUCK WATER IN FROM PORTER BILL. ABOUT TWENTY MILES AWAY. FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN HAVE NOT HAD WATER FURTHER SWAMP COOLERS TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM THE BLISTERING SUMMER HEAT THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND REALLY ACROSS. THE ENTIRE STATE I HAVE SEEN. FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO VAPOR CHILDREN COOK THE FOOD OR FLUSH THEIR TOILETS WITH WATER RUNNING FROM THEIR TAX. MANY COMMUNITIES WILL BE CELEBRATING THE FOURTH OF JULY THIS WEEKEND WITH FIREWORKS. THE RISK OF DOING SO UNTIL RESIDENT. COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE WATER PRESSURE. TO PUT OUT FIRES. ANOTHER COMMUNITY IN MY SENATE-DISTRICT AVENUE HOME TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE MOSTLY FARMWORKERS. PREDICTS THEY WILL BE WITHOUT WATER BY AUGUST. AVENAL RECEIVES WATER FROM THE ST LOUIS CANAL PER THE CALIFORNIA ACCIDENT. PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT REAL PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING NOW BECAUSE THESE CANALS ARE IN DIRE NEED OF REPAIR. INVESTING IN THESE CANALS WON'T HELP THEM TODAY BUT TO DO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO INVEST. HAVE HAD INVESTED YEARS AGO INVESTING TODAY WILL ENSURE THAT WE AND THEY ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE LOST AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PUT BACK INTO THE GROUND TO RECHARGE OUR AQUIFERS. THAT AMOUNT OF WATER COULD HAVE PROVIDED FOR A CITY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR A WHOLE YEAR. WE MUST INVEST NOW AS WE ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR NEXT ROUTE SO WE ARE NOT IN THE SAME POSITION E ARE TODAY. WITH TALENTS LIKE THOSE IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE WITHOUT WATER. THE WATER PROVIDED BY THESE CANALS ISN'T JUST. USED BY RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT. IT IS ALSO USED BY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT URBAN USERS AND LOS ANGELES AND THE GREATER BAY AREA. ASSEMBLY THIRTY ONE MILLION OF THEM. SOME OF WHOM LIVE IN OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THIS WATER ALSO PROTECTS THE LARGEST REMAINING WETLAND COMPLEX IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WHICH IS HOME TO OVER ONE. MILLION MIGRATING BIRDS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE. AND YES IT IS USED BY OUR STATE SMALL AND LARGE FARMERS THESE FARMERS CONTRIBUTE ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. COLLECTIVELY AND PROVIDE THOUSANDS OF JOBS FOR FARMWORKERS. BUT THIS ISN'T JUST A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FOOD SECURITY. CALIFORNIA FARMS NOT ONLY FEED OUR CONSTITUENTS BEFORE THE NATION. SB FIVE FIVE NINE PROVIDES US THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE BUT TO PROTECTED AS WELL. THE BILL LAYS OUT A PLAN TO FULLY FUND THE CANAL REPAIRS. AT SOME AT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. FOR PERSONAL PROVIDING THAT BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE STATE. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE INVEST IN REPAIRING THESE CANALS TODAY. EMBRACING A LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARTNERSHIPS TO DO SO CREATING NEEDED AND GOOD PAYING JOBS. HELPING US EFFECTIVELY MEET OUR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER GOALS AND ENSURING OUR CAPACITY TO REMAIN THE FOOD CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. AND SECURING ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES. AND TO JUSTIFY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL HAVE JENNIFER PIERRE WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. AND RICHARD ORTEGA FROM WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT. I THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE THE FULL THING MY NAME IS JENNIFER PAYER AND ON THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WE REPRESENT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR STATE WATER PROJECT WATER THE FEDERAL AND STATE OWNED CANALS IDENTIFIED IN SB FIVE FIVE NINE ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE BY FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER WHEN IT'S WET. TO STORAGE FOR USE DURING DROUGHT THESE CANALS PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO THIRTY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS IRRIGATION WATER TO OVER THREE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. BUT THE SILENCE WHICH HAS BEEN OCCURRING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR NEARLY A CENTURY HAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED SUPPLY RELIABILITY. AND INCREASED ENERGY CONSUMPTION. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING A 33% REDUCTION OF DESIGN FLOW CAPACITY. AND AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL AND POWER COSTS. THIS IS THE ANIMAL GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. WILL ENSURE SUBSIDENCE DOESN'T CONTINUE. WHILE SB FIVE FIVE NINE WILL FUND REPAIRS TO THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORT THE STATE'S ECONOMY CLIMATE RESILIENCY FOOD SECURITY ECOSYSTEM HEALTH. AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY VETO MESSAGE BY ESTABLISHING A HOLISTIC STATEWIDE SOLUTION. TO RESTORE THE CAPACITY OF THE FOUR MAJOR CANALS THAT SERVE SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. INCLUDING AN EQUAL THREE WAY LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL COST SHARE. THE PRODUCTS WERE BUILT TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC INCLUDING FLOOD CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS AND HYDRO ELECTRICITY. ON TOP OF DIRECT BENEFITS OF WATER SUPPLY. THESE BENEFITS SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH JOB CREATION TAX REVENUES AND OTHER BENEFITS. THROUGH THE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENT CONTEMPLATED IN FIVE FIVE NINE THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- GATHER WITH FEDERAL FUNDING FROM TWO COMPANION BILLS INTRODUCED BY US SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. AND CONGRESSMAN JIM ACOSTA. AND A LOCAL COST SHARE WE HAVE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT STATE BUDGET SURPLUS TO LEVERAGE LOCAL AND FEDERAL DOLLARS. FOR IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY SAN LUIS AND DELTA MENDOTA WATER AUTHORITY AND THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE FIVE NINE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS RICARDO ORTEGA GENERAL MANAGER OF THE GRASS AND WATER DISTRICT AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. I ALSO SERVED AS A BOARD MEMBER ON THE SAN LUIS AND DELTA MENDOTA WATER AUTHORITY. COMPRISED OF TWENTY SEVEN AGRICULTURAL MUNICIPAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL WATER AGENCIES. THAT OPERATE MAINTAIN THE DELTA MENDOTA CANAL. I'M PLEASED TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FIVE NINE. THE FEDERAL DELTA MENDOTA IN FRONT KERN CANALS HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT FLOW CAPACITY OVER THE DECADES TO LAND SUBSIDENCE. WHICH IS IMPACTED THE ABILITY TO RELIABLY DELIVER WATER TO MANY SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COMMUNITIES FARMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE CANALS CONVEY WATER TO MILLIONS OF ACRES OF FARMLAND. AND TO THE LAST REMAINING 5% OF WETLANDS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THESE WEAPONS RECHARGE AQUIFERS AND ROUTE SUPPORT MILLIONS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE EACH YEAR. THE GRASS AND WATER DISTRICT CONVEYS WATER TO WILDLIFE REFUGES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS WELL THE MOST IMPORTANT WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS REMAINING IN IN THE AMERICANS. WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE REQUIRE ADEQUATE SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON A SCHEDULE THAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL TO THEM. SUBSIDENCE ALONG THESE CANALS THREATENS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ENOUGH WATER TO THE HABITAT AND TO THE AND TO KEEP WILDLIFE POPULATIONS HEALTHY. RESTORING THE CAPACITY AND IS THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP IN BUILDING RESILIENCY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. DROUGHTS ARE NOW MORE SIGNIFICANT MORE FREQUENT LONGER LASTING AND MORE SEVERE STORMS ARE WARMER PRODUCE LESS NOW BUT ALSO MORE FLOODING. CALIFORNIA NEEDS WATER FACILITIES THAT CAN RECAPTURE FLOOD WATER EFFICIENTLY. AND DELIVER IT TO LAND SECOND RECHARGE THE AQUIFER. CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEM IS INTERCONNECTED AND WAS BUILT ON A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCALS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. SB FIVE FIVE NINE ON THAT PARTNERSHIP BY PROVIDING. A STATE MATCH TO LOCAL COMMITMENTS TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CALIFORNIANS ON THE ENVIRONMENT DEPEND ON. WHAT CREATING AND SUSTAINING THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. CRITICS ARE SAYING THIS FUNDING SHOULD BE RAN THROUGH A MORE CUMBERSOME STATE AGENCY. FUNDING PROCESS BUT TO WHAT END WE DO NOT NEED TO SLOW THIS DOWN. THIS IS AN THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. WE ARE AGAINST THE STATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND IMPLEMENTING. AND IMPLEMENTING THESE PROJECTS SO LONG AS IT DOES NOT SLOW DOWN OR KILL THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE AND- ON THE FLOOR TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE.

BRANDEN DAWSON YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING SIR MEMBERS BRENNAN DAWSON DIRECTORS HERE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC A THIRD YEAR IN A ROW WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE NINE. TWO MAJOR ISSUES WITH THIS BILL FIRST BY INCLUDING TWO FEDERALLY ON CANAL SYSTEMS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE BENEFICIARY PAYS PRINCIPLE WHICH REQUIRES THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT PAPERCLIP BENEFIT. FROM SUBJECT AT THE COMMITTEE KNOWLEDGE THIS ACCURATELY STATES PARK TECHNOLOGY PART OF THE C. B. P. AND OPERATED FOR BENEFIT OF MOSTLY AGRICULTURE- GATORS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SIMILARLY WITH THE DOCUMENT ON ACCOUNT AND ARGUED THOSE BENEFICIARIES MAINLY LARGE AFTER AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES% REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE SPONSORS AND THE PROPONENTS REQUIRED. IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BEAR THE COST TO REPAIR NOT STATE TAXPAYERS WE KNOW THE COMMUNITY TO RECEIVE WATER FROM THESE ISSUES THE ONLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OFFENSE ANSWERS TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT ENABLES BOTH THE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING THAT WATER BUT AS WRITTEN AT THREE FIVE FIVE NINE WOULD YOU SIGN TO STOP STATE TAXPAYERS. INCLUDING THOSE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE TO ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZE AGRICULTURAL CROP PRODUCTION GLOBAL GLOBAL TOWARDS THE REPAIR MISSION HEALTHY CELLS OR JUST THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM. WHICH WHICH BY SEVEN POINT. I BACKUP NOT DID NOT NO DRUG THE VERY OF THE BILL SEEKS TO A- LAND BLANTON. CALLED BY ALL POPULAR I LOT OF RESEARCH. IMPLEMENT OF SIX AND- IN THE GROUNDWATER BUT ARTS GEORGE RESULTS JUMPED. FORTY EVEN MANY OF THE GROUNDWATER. PLAN THAT BEEN COMMITTED THE STATE SUFFICIENT WHICH TAKES NOT MAKE SUCH AS SOON OF INVESTMENT WITH A COMPLETE. AS TO THE- LINES WILL HAVE ON YOUR SYSTEM. OVER THAT TWENTY YEARS. WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ON THESE MEASURES AS WELL AS WITH THE AUTHORS. THERE DID ABOUT NO AS WE GOT OF NINE THANK YOU. HERE KNOW LIKE LINE SEAT. PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTER MY NAME IS MICHAEL INTHE OF THE POLICY CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPTION TO A COMMENT. ON ONE OF POST SB FIVE FIVE NINE IT IS AMENDED IT COMMITS THE TO SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION AND SPENDING UPON APPROPRIATION WITHOUT OVERSIGHT OR TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM THE STATE INVESTMENT THE EXTENT OF THE PRIVATE BENEFICIARY KASHA OR THE DURABILITY OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT HAS GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT CONTINUES WELL STATEMENT IS BEING RAMPED UP OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. HOW DID ONE KNOWS THE RELIABLE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE THE ENVIRONMENT AND AGRICULTURE AND THAT THERE ARE ALL IMPORTANT WE SUPPORT THESE A PUBLIC FUNDS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPAIR THESE CONVEYANCES AND WE KNOW THAT THESE THAT WE NEED TO A PARIS CONVENTUS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AND I AND I AGREE WITH HER COULD TAKE ON THAT PART WE DON'T WANT TO GET BOGGED DOWN RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER SB FIVE FIVE NINE SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED TO ENSURE OVERSIGHT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE INSURANCE THE PUBLIC BENEFITS NOTABLY THE COMPANION FEDERAL LEGISLATION IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT MORE DETAILED ON THESE ISSUES INCLUDING OVERSIGHT BECAUSE SHARE PROJECT DESIGN ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE FOR SB. FIVE FIV NINE PLAN WHICH IS PRETTY THREADBARE. THE COMMITTEE AND I OF AS FIVE FIVE NINE PLAY NO RECALL FOR THE- OF PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR HIGH. OF MILLIONS OF STATE TAX DOLLARS ALLOWANCE BENEFITS PUBLIC SEGMENTS FOR THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BE REPAIRED. NO THOSE BENEFITS PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE BY THE DMC ARE DIFFERENT AND BENEFITS PROVIDED ELSEWHERE THERE'S NO WAY TO DETERMINE THAT IN THE BILL OR IN THIS PROCESS. IT'S A% MASSIVE DEPARTURE THE PRESIDENT SET BY PROP ONE. AND A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ON THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. ESPECIALLY AS WE MODERNIZE MY PARENTS. IT ONLY ALLUDES TO ADEQUATE COST SHARE BEHIND NO TRANSPARENCY OR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE KASHA BY THE DIRECT PRIVATE BENEFICIARIES THE STATE INVESTMENT. FOR THE PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE THAT MUST NOW BE REPAIRED. FINALLY SB FIVE FIVE NINE HAS NO LANGUAGE TO PROTECT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT CHRONIC OVERDRAFT CONTINUES WALKED EGGMAN IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. IN FUTURE DAMAGE TO THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL LIKELY NEED FURTHER TAXPAYER INVESTMENTS. SENATOR HER TITLE RIGHTLY RAISES THE ISSUES OF COMMUNITY SUFFERING DUE TO THE LOSS OF WELLS. WHICH HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF OVER PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER PRIMARILY FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES HAS HE FIVE FIVE NINE DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM CONTINUED- GRAFT IN THE NEAR TERM. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ASSURANCES THE PUBLIC BENEFITS SUCH AS DRINKING WATER AND DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES OR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE PRIORITIZED. IN TWENTY NINETEEN OUTOF ON TRY TO. SUPPORT SENATOR- HER DAUGHTER'S FIVE FIVE NINE WITH PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT DISCUSSION. WE DO WANT YOU CAN DANCE IS TO BE EXPEDITIOUSLY REPAIR.

WORKING IN THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS. SO WHAT CAN WE ASK THE POINT OF HAVING THE- ANNUALLY GEN. ACCOUNTING THE DAILY AS YEARS AGO. LESS THAN. IN PICTURE OF THE TWO COST. OF THE PUBLIC VERSUS SECTOR ENGINEERS. AGAIN WE AGREE WITH RANGING DEPARTMENT DESIGNED SEEM TO STATE. WE CANNOT IN THE PUBLIC NOT. EX THIS MISLEADING REPORT PART OF THE PART. OR ANY PUBLIC ENTITY FOR THAT MATTER. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THESE REASONS MISTER SPARKLY OPPOSE SB. SIX TWO SIX THANKS VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WE'LL WE'LL OTHER. FOR THAT WE DID. MAYBE THE LAST FORTY SECONDS OF MISTER MARCHING THROUGH. TESTIMONY PERHAPS WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH HIM TO GET. HIS TESTIMONY IN WRITING TO SUBMITTED AND FOR THE RECORD. AND AND LET HIM KNOW THAT SO THAT THAT HE IS AWARE SO WE ONLY CAUGHT. A PORTION OF IT- LAST TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE IN THE ROOM ARE WISHING TO TESTIFY AGAINST. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ANYONE IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. OKAY WE'LL GO TO THE- PHONE LINES- MISTER MODERATOR BEFORE- WE OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. ANYONE WISHING TO COMMENT IN IN OPPOSITION. TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SB SIX TWO SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. THERE'S NO ONE IN THE QUEUE FOR OPPOSITION THANK YOU- WE WILL NOW BRING IT TO THE FLOOR I SEE A COUPLE MIKES THAT HAVE BEEN IFTED UP. SUMMER THANK THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I WAS WONDERING IF I CAN ASK A QUESTION A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT PLEASES SOMEONE TONIGHT IF SOMEONE OF DEPARTMENT IS AVAILABLE YES THERE'S A SO- IT APPEARS THAT SECTION FIVE IS ATTEMPTING TO GET A COMPARING THE COST OF THE DEPARTMENT USING PRIVATE CONSULTANTS TO PERFORM THE ENGINEERING ON THESE PROJECT VERSUS USING DEPARTMENT ENGINEERS TO PERFORM THIS WORK. AND IF MY QUESTION CAN COME AFTER I CONFERENCE I'VE- SO YOU KNOW I'VE LOOKED AT THE L. A. ANALYSIS THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY- ABOUT THOSE MISSING COSTS WHEN THIS WAS REPORTED BACK IN THOUGH IN THE NINETEEN NINETY A BALLOT. INITIATIVE ONE DENOUNCES WOULD NOT REFLECT A TO APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON OF TOTAL COSTS. TO COST FACTORS ON THE PUBLIC SIDE THAT WERE AND LIGHTLY OR UNCERTAIN TO BE COUNTED IN THE TOTAL COSTS INCLUDED ONE STATE AGENCY OVERHEAD COSTS WHICH IS. TOP MANAGEMENT. TO OTHERS STATE AGENCY OVERHEAD COSTS SUCH AS PAYROLL ACCOUNTING AND PERSONNEL FUNCTIONS THREE HIRING AND TRAINING CLASSES FOR ANY ADDITIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES NEEDED TO PERFORM A SERVICE. FOR INCREASED CONSTRUCTION COSTS IS ASSOCIATE WOULD PROJECTS DELAYS CAUSED BY TIME NEEDED TO HIRE AND TRAIN ADDITIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES- THE LAST ONE IS COSTS OF MAINTAINING EXCESSIVE STATE STAFF IF WORKLOAD DECLINES SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE IS THAT SO WOULD IT BE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT SECTION FIVE REPORTING THIS BILL IS ASKING D. W. R. TO GIVE THE LOWEST CASE ESTIMATE ON THE COST OF USING STATE EMPLOYEES AND THE HIGHEST CASE ESTIMATE FOR USE A PRIVATE. ENGINEERS AND THEN SECOND IS- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S A FAIR APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON TO YOU. SCOUT WILLIS YEAH I THINK THAT THREATENS THEM IS CUTTING ANY TITLE. YEAH AND YEAH I AGREE THAT- THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE- NOT INCLUDING ALL OF THE AND- THAT AS IT IS WRITTEN- BUT THE DEPARTMENT WERE WILLING TO PROVIDE WHATEVER COSTS ARE- REQUESTED IN THE LEGISLATION. THE MAY I ADD TO THE LIKE TO FALL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWENTY NINE NINETEEN IT'S VERY SPECIFIC THAT THE ONLY COST YOU CAN COUNT OUTSIDE SELLING BENEFITS THOSE DIRECTLY AND SOLELY AT TO BE ABLE TO THOSE STATE ENGINEERS WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS. AND THAT GOES SAME WITH LYING TWENTY ON THE PRIVATE ENGINEERS SITE AS WELL I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AT ALL THE CLASSES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEN THAT WAY JUST GIVES US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUE COSTS AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS BEST. BUT GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PROJECT IS DONE CORRECTLY AND THAT IT'S ALSO- NO NOT UNDER ESTIMATED OR UNDER COSTS- SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE HAVE EVERYTHING UP FRONT AND TRANSPARENT. DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S A FAIR APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON THEN. THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. WITH SECTION. FIVE NO IT IS NOT A COKE IT IS NOT A- CURRENTLY HAS WRITTEN IS NOT AN APPLE TO APPLE COMPARISON FOR THAT THE REASON YOU CAN MENTION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YES MISTER SENATOR DODD SO THAT WAS ALSO MY CONCERN AS SECTION FIVE- I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO LOWER COSTS AND INCREASES IN FISSION SEATS ON CAPITAL PROJECTS- MOVING FORWARD ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOK AT THOSE ARE TAKE AMENDMENTS. IN REGARDS TO SECTION FIVE. THE IS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME- PARTICULARLY IN THIS ROOM I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO- TO LISTEN TO ARGUMENTS AND ALSO SOLUTIONS TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. THANK YOU. SIX SO LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE BILL WITH AMENDMENTS STRIKING SECTION FIVE FROM THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT IS MY BIG CONCERN WITH HIS BILL TO IF YOU'RE IF YOU CAN GO WITH THAT- IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE BUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT IT IS A FLAWED REPORT. WHAT MORE REASONS DO WE NEED BUT TERRIBLE GOVERNMENTS. TO APPROVE A BILL BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE SECTION OF MY MOTION IS TO PROVE IT WAS SECTION FIVE TAKEN OUT. THERE IS A MOTION. OKAY THE SECOND FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES. REMISSION WITHIN THE LONGER. YES WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CONSIDER THAT A HOSTILE AMENDMENT- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT- THESE BILLS COULD BE ANALYZED MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY BY HAVING STAFF LOOK AT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AND ALL THE ANALYSIS TO DO THAT ON THE FLOOR TODAY IN MY OPINION AND- I DRIVE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THE BILL TO BE PASSED AS IS. THE FURTHER UP CAN I GET A COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL LOOK AT SECTION FIVE. AS IT MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. BUT IT'S JUST SECOND FIVE THAT I HAVE A CONCERN WITH AZAR OF RETIRED CONTRACTOR. WHEN WE ARE GONNA SOLIDIFY JUST ONE DEPARTMENT BEING ABLE TO WORK OUT IT SHOULD BE BE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE. THE TO MAKE THE PROJECTS GO QUICKER IF WHAT I'M SEVEN MEMBER I WOULD SET ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY. ASK ME THE QUESTION I SAID YES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- I I'M WILLING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

CLARIFY THE TAX EXEMPTION- SB SEVEN NINE SIX. REPRESENTS S. STORABLE. MISTER JUSTICE ARE IN JUST AS I SHOULD SAY THAT WAS PLACED UPON. AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. CHARLES AND WILL OF BRUCE PURCHASE A PIECE OF PROPERTY IN MANHATTAN BEACH IN NINETEEN TWELVE SIMPLY TO LIVE OUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. TO SIMPLY PROVIDE A SEPARATE BUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS DIRECTORY AND ENJOY BEACH LIFE JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. BUT IN NINETEEN TWELVE THE PURCHASES PROPERTY. OPEN UP A BEACH HOUSE A RESTAURANT A DANCE HALL- AND IT DRIVES. IT DRIVE FOR TWELVE YEARS DESPITE THE RACIST ATTACKS ON BOTH THE BRUCE FAMILY AND THE SIX OTHER FAMILIES TO PURCHASE PROPERTY THERE BY NOT ONLY LOCAL RESIDENTS BUT THE KKK AND AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF. VICIOUS RACISTS ATTACKS WHEN THAT WASN'T ABLE TO DRIVE THE BRUISES AND THE SIX OTHER FAMILIES OFF THE LAND THE CITY OF MANHATTAN BEACH INTERCEDED TO STEAL THIS LAND. THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN. THEY FORCED THE FAMILIES TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY UNDER THE GUISE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BUILD A PARK. WELL WE STAND HERE TODAY AND THERE'S STILL NO PARK AT BRUCE'S BEACH YES THERE IS A MONUMENT AND THERE'S A BATCH. BUT THERE'S NEVER THE PART THAT WAS PROMISED AND AFTER OVER TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF OCCUPYING THE PROPERTY. THEY DEEDED OVER TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA POSSESSING A PROPERTY FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS THERE WERE STILL. NO PARK BUILT AND THAT'S WHEN THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE DEEDED THE PROPERTY OVER TO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE STAND HERE TODAY WORKING IN CONCERT WITH THIS. STATE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THE FREE THEIR HANDS TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TO RETURN THIS PROPERTY BACK. TO THE HEIRS OF CHARLES AND WILL LOOK BRUCE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S NOT A GIFT THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND THE SAD THING IS THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. THERE'S HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES OF WORK AFTER AMERICANS. WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR PROPERTY SIMPLY BECAUSE OF RACIST HATE AND JUST. JUST THE FACT THAT THEY JUST THEY'RE WALKING. THEM IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY USE THE LAW TO COMMIT CRIMES. RED ZONE IN IT AND REDLINING I SHOULD SAY AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND I STAND HERE TODAY YOU'RE ON JULY FIRST. AND IN MY DISTRICT. IN THE COMMUNITY- WHAT'S WHERE THERE'S BEEN THE HAWKINS HOUSE OF BURGERS THAT IT EXISTED FOR EIGHTY YEARS. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IS MALPRACTICE TO RUN THAT FAMILY OFF A PIECE OF LAND. THAT THEY HAVE HAD A BUSINESS FOR EIGHTY YEARS PRIOR TO THE ONE OH FIVE FREEWAY SPLITTING THE COMMUNITY OF WHAT'S- THIRTY PLUS YEARS AGO SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BRUCE FAMILY IS HAPPENING TODAY TO THE HAWKING FAMILY AND WATCHED AND IT'S NOT USED AND WE SHOULD SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS ACTUALLY KILEY CODES- I'M THE JUSTICE DEPUTY FOR SUPERVISOR JANICE HAHN UNFORTUNATELY SUPERVISOR HAHN WAS UNABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY BUT SHE STRONGLY SUPPORTS I READ HER TESTIMONY ON HER BEHALF. I WANT TO START BY THANKING SENATOR STEVEN BRADFORD FOR OFFERING SENATE BILL SEVEN NINE SIX AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI FOR ALL HIS SUPPORT AND FOR BEING A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON THE SCALE. I GREW UP IN L. A. COUNTY MY WHOLE LIFE WITH THE FAMILY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN LOCAL POLITICS. AND YET I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T HEAR THE HISTORY OF BREEZES BEACH UNTIL LAST YEAR. I'VE GROWN UP THINKING THAT THE JIM CROW SEGREGATIONIST POLICIES OF THE SOUTH DID NOT HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT FOR THE MOST PART OF CALIFORNIANS WERE CLEAN OF SUCH A RACIST PAST. BUT THAT WASN'T TRUE. THE STORY BRIDGES BEACH IS THE STORY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM BEING STOLEN FROM HARDWORKING AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. A LAWFUL DRIVING BUSINESS THAT PROVIDED AFRICAN AMERICANS ACCESS TO THE BEACH WAS INTENTIONALLY SHUT DOWN BY THE CITY GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF DRIVING OUT BLACK FAMILIES AND BLACK BEACH GOERS. WHAT HAPPENED TO WILL AND CHARLES BRUCE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS A GREAT INJUSTICE THAT WAS NOT ONLY INFLICTED ON THEM BUT ALSO ON GENERATIONS OF THEIR DESCENDANTS ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN MILLIONAIRES HAD THEY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEIR PROPERTY. I WHILE WE CANNOT CHANGE THE PAST WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER IN THE PRESIDENT TO CRACK THIS HISTORIC INJUSTICE. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT L. A. COUNTY CURRENTLY OWNS THE LAND THAT WAS- THAT WAS ONCE BRIDGES BEACH I KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT WE HAD TO GIVE IT BACK. TODAY THIS LAND IS THE SITE O THE LA COUNTY LIFEGUARD ADMINISTRATION. BUILDING AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THIS RIGHT IS TO TRANSFER THE LAND BACK TO THE DESCENDANTS OF WILL AND CHARLES BRUCE. L. A. COUNTY INTENDS TO GIVE IT BACK AND WE INTEND TO SHOW THE REST OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEGIN TO MAKE AMENDS. BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP. WHEN THE STATE TRANSFER THE LAND TO THE COUNTY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. IT CAME WITH RESTRICTIONS. WE CAN'T TRANSFER THE LAND BACK TO BRIDGETOWN THE UNTIL THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED. SO PLEASE HELP US RIGHT THIS HISTORIC WRONG BY PASSING SB SEVEN NINE SIX AND REMOVING THE RESTRICTIONS ON BRIDGES BEACH. THE L. A. COUNTY CAN TRANSFER IT BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS. THE DESCENDANTS OF WILL AND CHARLES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL WE HAVE ANOTHER PERSON CALLING IN AS A WITNESS- THE CENTER SAID. I ONLY HEAR TO SUPERVISOR LISTED AS PRIMARY WITNESS OKAY. FOR MODERATE.

I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL NOT JUST FOR THE BRUCE'S BUT REALLY TO SHOW WHAT. JUSTICE CAN LOOK LIKE AND RESTORATIONS CAN LOOK LIKE AND- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE STILL TAKING ANY AMENDMENTS BUT I'D BE VERY PROUD TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PLEASE. THANK YOU- MAYBE FOR THE AUTHOR TO HELP FOR A FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND. THIS BILL IS A LITTLE SILENT ON WHAT REALLY THE NEXT STEPS ARE WITH RESPECT TO THE ZONING. WHILE THIS LAND WOULD BE RESTORED BACK TO THE FAMILIES AND OFFER TO- AND THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY STATE- DIRECTION ON IT REMAINING AS A PART. THERE STILL IS THE VOID OF KNOWLEDGE OF KNOWING THAT THEY WILL BE RESTORED TO WHAT AT A USABLE ZONING WILL BE THERE SO THEY'RE NOT LEFT HANGING. WITH A PIECE OF LAND THAT STILL CAN'T BE USED. SO THERE NEEDS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND MAYBE YOU CAN ADD SOME CLARITY TO THAT OR MAYBE THE SUPERVISORS STAFFER COULD ADD SOME CLARITY TO THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I STILL SUPPORT THE BILL THE- THROUGH THIS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS WE DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE DETAILS. BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT. I TOTALLY AGREE AND CURRENTLY IT IS OUR INTENTION TO AND THROUGH THE COUNTY TO. RETURN THE PROPERTY AS OWN CURRENTLY AND- HOPEFULLY LEAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. ALL WITH THE CITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE VOICED THEIR OPPOSITION- TO RETURNING THIS PROPERTY SADLY I MEAN. A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER- THE CITY STILL IN A PROPERTY THEIR STEEL HAVE. DUG THEIR HEELS IN THE SAND AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF THEIR COUNSEL. AND NOT ONE APOLOGIZING TO THE FAMILY BUT YEAH- LET ALONE. STATING THEIR POSITION SO RIGHT NOW IT'S A LIFEGUARD STATION- TRAINING STATION THAT'S THERE. THE COUNTY HAS COMMITTED TO A CONTINUED PLAN LEAST AS IS. UNTIL WE CAN WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS SO IT WILL CONTINUE AS THAT- UNTIL WE CAN. FURTHER WORK THIS OUT AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. WE THROUGH THAT MA'AM IT'S TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE IT ALSO PROTECTS THE FAMILY FROM. THE DAYS- SAYS VALUE SO THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR PROPERTY IF IT WAS GIVEN BACK TO HIM ACTED.
