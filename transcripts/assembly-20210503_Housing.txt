IF THAT- WE HAVE FIVE MISTER BENNETT HERE FILE ITEM. ONE AB. EIGHT SIX ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMAN. I'D LIKE TO WEAR THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COLLABORATION WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY A. B. C. H. SIXTY ONE CLARIFIES ANY RULES RELATING TO SUB LEASING OR RENTING A MANUFACTURED MOBILE HOME PARK APPLY EQUALLY TO MANAGEMENT AND RESIDENTS. BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ONE IMPORTANT CONCEPT HERE THAT I THINK IS HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY EXPRESSED BY MYSELF EVEN AS I TRIED TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS AND IT IS SIMPLY THIS THERE IS A LIMITED SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR PARK OWNERS TO BUY THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS. I'M SORRY FOR THESE PARK OWNERS TO BUY THESE MOBILE HOMES AND THEY COME AVAILABLE. AND ULTIMATELY THAT CAN DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF FORMAL HOUSING OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE. THE POTENTIAL TO AVOID THE- RESTRICTIONS ON RANTS THAT APPLY TO- THE MOBILE HOMES THAT ARE OWNED BY THEIR CURRENT TENANTS. ARE THAT'S THE REAL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE AND THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE LAW. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TEMP TO TRY TO CLARIFY. OR IMPLEMENT THE LAW AS DEFINED BY KAMALA HARRIS WHEN SHE OFFERED HER OPINION AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. IN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MANUFACTURED HOMES- AND THE OPINION MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THEM AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO ALL OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAY ULTIMATELY BE WANTING OR NEEDING. TO BUY- A MANUFACTURED HOME. AND SO AB EIGHT SIXTY ONE WILL PROTECT THOSE LOW INCOME. RESIDENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE BRUCE DOWN THE LEGAL COUNSEL FOR OUR GSM- WELL ONLINE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE PROCEED I'M GONNA ASK US TO TAKE THE WORLD ESTABLISH QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY. CHILL Q. HERE THEY ARE TELL HI THERE. XARELTO HERE GABRIEL. KALRA KALRA HERE KILEY KILEY HERE MAIENSCHEIN QUICK SILVA QUIKSILVER HERE WICKS. WE HAVE QUORUM WITHOUT SIR WHEN WE PROCEED TO YOUR MAIN WITNESS- TO THE OPERATOR WE HAVE BRUCE STANTON FROM GUESS MALL ON THE LINE IF YOU COULD PLEASE LET HIM. SPEAK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS STANTON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR GSM ALLOW IT SUPPORTS. LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE UNEQUALLY TREATED WHEN IT COMES TO THE ABILITY TO RECTOR SO PLEASE THEIR HOMES WELL MOST PARKS HAVE RULES PROHIBITING RESIDENTS FROM RENTING- SO PLEASE TAKE AT BATS HIS MIND ACCORDING TO THE LAW. DOES SAY PARKS OFTEN PURCHASE AND WRAPPED UP- SO PLEASE VOEPEL OFFICE OWNED BY PARK MANAGEMENT. THIS RESULTED IN THAT SITUATION WHERE THE PARK OWNER IS NOT FOLLOWING ITS OWN RULES. AND GET THE BENEFIT OF SELF POLICING WHILE PARK RESIDENTS DO NOT. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL OPINION. OF COMELEC HARRIS DECLARED THAT BASED ON THE EXISTING VOEPEL PRESIDENCY LAW PARK RULES APPLY EQUALLY TO MANAGEMENT AND RESIDENTS. AT A PARK OWNER IS ALSO ABOUT TO FOLLOW ITS RULES PROHIBIT EXCEPT LEASING. BARGAINERS DISTINGUISH THE OPINION BY SAYING WILL PROHIBITING RESIDENTS FROM SUB LEASING QUOTE UNQUOTE DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM SINCE THEY OWN THE HOMES AND ARE DIRECTLY WRENCHING THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE. BUT THIS IS A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHETHER CALL THE RATTLERS SUBLEASE THE END RESULT IS THE SAP. IT RESIDENTS CANNOT SUBLEASE TO READ PARK MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE EQUALLY BOUT IT SHOULD ABIDE BY ITS OWN RULES. THE MRL SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO SPECIFICALLY ELIMINATE THIS DOUBLE STANDARD. TO FINAL KEY POINTS FIRST THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPEDE A PARK OWNERS ABILITY TO CREATE OR CHANGE PARK RULES IF A PARK OWNER WISHES TO BAN SUBLEASE AGO RANKING. THE KITCHEN USED HAVE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO DO SO OR IF YOU WISH TO ALLOW SO POLICING CORRECTING IF I DO SO. SECOND THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT A PARKING OF FROM HOUSING EMPLOYEES AT THE PARK BUT SIMPLY CLARIFIES ONCE A PARK WATER MAKES THE DECISION. TO ALLOW OR PROHIBIT SUBLEASE YOU CORRECTING THAT EVERYONE INCLUDING THE PARK AUTONOMOUS FAIRLY A BITE. AND FOLLOW THOSE SAME RULES. ON THAT BASIS RESPECT ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA GO TO WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND WE'VE WON ONE IS HERE AND THE COMMITTEE ROOM MISTER GOVERNOR. IF YOU LIKE TO WATCH- MAKE YOUR OPPOSITION PRESENTATION AND WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER WITNESS BY PHONE MISTER GOVERNOR. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- STAFF AND THANK ACTUALLY CENTRAL COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR GIVING US PROBABLY MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME SO THANK YOU. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE IS WRONG BETWEEN SUBLETTING RENTING THE PARK OWNER DOESN'T SUBLET AND HAS A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION. SOMEONE WHO RENTS THE LAND FROM US THEN RE RENTS A SOMEONE WHO WE DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH US IS A SUB LETTER. APARTMENTS ARE STATUTORILY FORBIDDEN FROM SUBLETTING IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OUR RESEARCH WE CAN'T FIND OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW IT. NOR THAT MANDATE THE MOBILE HOME PARK ON IS AFTER ALLOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT ON RENT CONTROL IF YOU SIMPLY ALLOW SUBLETTING EVERYWHERE IT WILL BLOW UP AND MAKE RECONCILE POINTLESS. HOW DOES THIS HELP PROVIDE A PUT A ROOF OVER ANYONE TELL OVER ANYONE'S HEAD IN FACT THIS WILL SIMPLY TURN MOBILE HOMES INTO VACATION AND SHORT TERM RENTALS FROM SUB LESSEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF HOUSING ESPECIALLY IN COASTAL CITIES THIS ASSEMBLY TURN INTO A COTTAGE BUSINESS INDUSTRY FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE MONEY BECAUSE THERE'S NO LIMITS. ALSO IF THIS PASSES SO IN THE PRACTICE OF MOBILE HOME RENTALS VERSUS FORCING PEOPLE TO BUY HOMES THE REASON WHY MANY HOME OWNERS HAVE HOMES IS BECAUSE IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN FORECLOSURES AND OTHER THINGS HAPPEN AND PEOPLE JUST ABANDONED HOMES WE'VE TAKEN OVER IF THIS BILL PASSES IT WILL SAY UNLESS WE ALLOW SUBLETTING FOR EVERYONE. IF WE TAKE OVER A HOME BECAUSE SOMEONE LEFT IT ABANDONED WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT VACANT BECAUSE IN A LOT OF AREAS WE CAN'T SELL IT WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT AT THIRTY FIVE RENTAL HOMES IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THERE NOW DOWN TO THREE BECAUSE THE MARKET OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS WASN'T THERE. FOR THEM TO SELL IT NOW THEY ARE. AFTER THE OWNERS OF FOR TO DO TO THINGS. BY GIVE MYSELF TIME OWNERS WILL EITHER HAVE TO DO A SUBLETTING POLICY FOR EVERYONE IN THE PARK OR THE HAVE TO FORCIBLY SELL OTHER PARK ON RENTALS WHICH MEANS THAT MOBILE HOME PARKS WILL BE ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER OWN PARK RENTAL AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THIS IS GOOD SUB WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD POLICY AND WE THINK THAT YOU'RE CONFLATING TWO CONCEPTS RUNNING ON SUB LEASING AND FOR THESE WE THINK THIS IS BAD POLICY FOR HOUSING IN THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE OPERATOR FOR COULD PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE. JASON I CURRENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHANGE CAN OCCUR WITHOUT A SINGLE PAYER PROBE SENTIMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY EIGHT SIX SIXTY ONE AND WILL INCREASE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM REPRESENTS W. NAY- IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES TO COMPARE- A PART OWNER OF THE THING OWN HOME TO A RESIDENTS MEETING IN OWN HOME THE PARK OWNER HAS AN OBLIGATION. TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE- AND THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY SHARE WITH THE RESIDENTS WOULD ALSO CHALLENGE THE ASSERTION MADE THAT THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO IMPEDE THE RENTAL OF THE CAR GOING HOME TO AN EMPLOYEE- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THE MISTAKE ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES ALLOW PARK OWNER TO BE USED. PULLING AND TEARING- AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN A FEW WEEKS AGO AFTER THAT THE FOLLOWING TO THE BILL QUOTE- IT AND IT'S A CRISIS IT TO AN EMPLOYEE RENTAL AND YOU WERE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO COOL IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS AN EMPLOYEE OF PARK MANAGEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A. RENTAL OR SUBLEASE IN PROHIBITION. LANGUAGES LINE OPEN WHAT IS THE- DOES THE MEAN TO. SOMEONE OF THE- TO OBTAIN VENTURA. APPROACH THAT'S VERY AND- IN REALITY. THE COURTS ARE GOING TO HAVE MAKE THE TO. ANNA PARKER EVERY THEY GO THERE WITH JANET LEIGH LISA. OF HOME TO EMPLOYEE IT'S IT IN THEIR INTEREST IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE SOMEONE LIVING ON SITE. WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THEY'RE VERY MUCH OPENING THEMSELVES UP TO LITIGATION AND DOING SO. SO AGAIN WE OPPOSE THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PREMISE OF THE BILL. AND IN PARTICULAR THE FIRST LANGUAGE WHICH WILL EFFECTIVELY MAKE IT. IMPOSSIBLE FOR CORPORATE TO RETURN A PHONE. CALL GOING TO CLEAN OUT WEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NOT GO TO. OF THE- THAT WISH TO SEE. OF FOR IN SUPPORT THE BILL DID NOT SEEN ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBER WAR AND- THE REMOTE STATION. LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES OPERATOR IF YOU COULD ACKNOWLEDGE ANYONE WHO'S SUPPORTING THE BILL. SURE SURE SURE SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHT SIX ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- LET ME JUST ALSO CONFIRM IT TOO WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER BEEN ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE MOMENTS YESTERDAY GREAT THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. OUR MOTION OF THIS FORD. IS MOTIONS ARE SECOND. GREAT- AND WITH THAT MISTER BENNETT IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND PERHAPS RESPOND TO ANY OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN RAISED THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO JUST ASK YOU ALL TO CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE SKILLED LEGISLATORS AND YOU HAVE. I OFTENTIMES HEARD THE OPPOSITION TO SOMETHING- MAKE CONFUSING ARGUMENTS THAT I DON'T ACCURATE ACCURATELY REFLECT REALITY. AND I WOULD OFFER TO YOU THAT'S WHERE THE SUB LEASING ARGUMENT IN OPPOSITION IS HERE. IF PARK OWNERS THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THERE COULD BE AIRBNB SAID THEY TO TICKET THE ALL THESE PARTS COULD BE CONVERTED OVER- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION OUT THERE THAT IS SENIORS LIVING IN THESE MOBILE HOME PARKS COUNTING ON THIS. AND FUTURE SENIORS THAT WILL NEED THIS OPTION. SO THE FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT. IS I BELIEVE THIS THIS IS NOT GOING TO. ALLOW A COULD NOT GOING TO BECAUSE ALL OF THE MOBILE HOME PARKS TO BECOME AIRBNB. IF THE PARK OWNERS DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN THEY SIMPLY MAKE THAT A RULE. IT'S JUST WHEN THEY MAKE THE RULE IT SHOULD APPLY TO THEM AND THEIR UNIT ALSO. IF YOU LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK. AND THERE'S YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED AND THE OTHER TENANTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE IT AS BE AN AIRBNB WHY SHOULD THE PARK OR BE ABLE TO TAKE TAKE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND BRING IN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PARTY. BUT THE BIG FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS THIS. AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH DO YOU WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PARK OWNERS TO CONTINUALLY BUY UP. THESE MOBILE PLEASE MANUFACTURED HOMES WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND DECREASE THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUT THERE. BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE AND BE ABLE TO GET THE RULES TO APPLY DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT COMES AROUND STABILIZATION. OR DO YOU WANT TO KEEP THESE UNITS AVAILABLE THE PRECIOUS FEW UNITS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT WHEN THAT ELDERLY WOMAN THAT'S NINETY THREE YEARS OLD PASSES AWAY THAT MOBILE HOME PARK AT THAT MANUFACTURED HOME. IS THEN SOLD TO SOMEBODY ELSE THAT NEEDS THAT THAT'S REALLY THIS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE WHO IS GOING TO HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO BUY THESE HOMES I BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT INCENTIVIZE. THE PARK OWNERS TO BUY UP A LARGER AND LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THESE MOBILE HOMES. VIBEKE BY BEING ABLE TO CREATE. DIFFERENT RULES FOR THEM- THEN APPLY TO THE TENANTS IN THEIR PARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WE FORTUNATE WITH FORWARD AND MATTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS- SHE HI SHE I'D SAY ARE TO NOW THEIR CHAIN NO GABRIEL. KALRA KALRA I. KILEY KNOWN. QUIRKS. QUICKSILVER I WICKS. THANK WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- ACTUALLY HAVE MISTER LEADERS OKAY FOR GO TO HIM AND THEN WE- HAVE YOU. PRESENT THE LAST FULL SO CALLED FIVE THREE AB TEN SIXTY. MR LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS AT FIRST LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS WITH MY STUFF ON IT. AB TEN SIXTY ONE WERE PROTECT MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS FROM ARBITRARY UNFAIR WATER SERVICE CHARGES. CURRENTLY MANY RESIDENTS ARE CHARGING AND BIGGEST WATER SERVICE FEE THAT OFTEN INCREASES WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION. OVER HALF OF MOBILE HOME HOUSEHOLDS EARN LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND MANY RESIDENTS ON FIXED INCOMES SO THESE FEES CAN ADD UP. QUICKLY BURDENSOME. I'LL BE EXCEPT MAKE MADE AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL ALLOW PARK OWNERS TO BE REIMBURSED FOR HIGHER WATER PRICES. THEY MAY. THEY MAY PAY DO TWO TIERED BILLING. THE MEMBER ALSO ALLOWED HELLO PARK ON TO BILL RESIDENTS MANAGEMENT OR THIRD COSTS ISSUED METER READER. METER READING SENDING OUT BILLS AND OTHER REASONABLE EXPENSES WE LAND ON THESE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THEY ALIGNED MOBILE HOME PARK. MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WITH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ALREADY APPLY TO HOME AN APARTMENT DOLLARS. THAT MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS PAID THEIR PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF PARK. A PARK OWNERS WATER CHARGES PLUS A REASONABLE SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT FEE. DESANCTIS FIND SUPPORT I HAVE RECEIVED BILLS SEASON. REGIONAL MANAGER FOR GIVE ALL AND BRUCE STANTON OF LEGAL COUNSEL FOR HIS ROLE AS WE ASK FOR YOUR PRIVATE. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO THE OP TO THE MAIN WITNESSES MISTER. M. STANTON. ABOUT FIVE- OPEN. AFTER MY NAME IS JOSEPH I'M I READ LEADER GSM ALL THE STATE MAN HOME OWNERS WE ARE NOT OR THAT HAS BEEN WORKERS PEOPLE OF MODERN MEANS- SENIORS AND AFTER IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN MOBILE HOMES NOW YOU HOME THROUGHOUT. FOR- OVER FIFTY. GEOTHERMAL ALSO AB TEND TO. AND MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WE SHOULD PAY FOR THE WATER WE- AND WE SHOULD PAY OUR WRITERS SHARE SERVICE CHARGE THE WATER COMPANY PARK OWNERS WHAT IS FAIR IS ONE WAY SO PETER AND PAUL OWNERS UP THE PRICE OF WATER AND ON TERROR. TODAY MANY PARKING ARE MORE SERVICE CHOI TO EACH HOMES THROUGHOUT THE PARK. OKAY MAKING UP THEIR OWN CHARGES SOME PARTS OF MAKING THE EXTRA OF THE MILLION A YEAR JUST ALL WATER CHARGE. THANK YOU. THANK. FOR GAS FOR A SECOND ONE IS PLEASE. YES HI THIS IS BRUCE STANTON GSM ALLOWING SUPPORT I ACTUALLY WOULD JUST ECHO EVERYTHING THE FIRST WITH THE STATIC MEDICATED BUT THEY'LL OFFER A QUESTION THANK YOU. H. ONE WE NOW GO TO. OUR MAIN WHEN AS AN OFFICE I KNOW GOVERNOR IS STILL HERE. THE COMMITTEE ROOM- BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO HAVE ONE MINUTE- AND THEN HAVE. YOU WILL TAKE TO OKAY GREAT. HOLD ON TO GET MY TIMER GOING. UNDER GOVERNOR BABBITT WMA RESPECTFULLY NOW MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY HAD ORIGINALLY WANTED TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE MR LEE AND THE SPONSORS THAT ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO ADOPT THE CPUC DECISION THAT'S BEEN LOST SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE REGULATING SUB METERS MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS ALMOST EIGHTY TO NINETY THOUSAND RESIDENTS ACTUALLY- HOWEVER WHEN THEY WROTE THE BILL THEY LEFT OUT ONE LINE OF THIS P. U. DECISION THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DELIVERY OF CHARGES FOR WATER. ALL APPROVED BY THE CPUC WHAT WE ASKED FOR WAS THAT ACTUALLY GO TO ALL THE MUNICIPALITIES SO WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WITH ALL OF THESE FACTS AND ALL THESE NUMBERS OR SUPPOSE THAT FACT THAT THE SPONSORS BRING UP WE'VE NEVER SEEN EVIDENCE ABOUT TO BACK UP ANY OF THESE THINGS AS A MATTER OF FACT THE WAY WE LOOK AT THIS BILL NOW. THEY ARE TAKING A WALK BILL FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT HAD TO DO WITH ENCOURAGING APARTMENTS TO PUT IN SUB METERS. OKAY APARTMENTS ARE SMALL UNITS YOU HAVE ABOUT EIGHT FEET FROM A MASTER METER TO A SUB METER AND A MOBILE HOME PARK YOU COULD HAVE PIPING GOING ACROSS THE ENTIRE PARK TO THE REASON WHY RATES ARE DIFFERENT AND YOU CAN'T COMPARE APARTMENTS MOBILE AND PARKS'S DID YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SET DELIVERY UNIT. IN ADDITION MUNICIPALITIES FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN APPROVING PASS THROUGH CHARGES FOR MOBILE HOME OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE READING OF THE METER THE SERVICING OF THE METER AND THE BILLING THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR THERE ARE NO ARBITRARY CHARGES THAT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSE WE ARE COMING ABOUT WMA HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THAT WATER IS NOT A PROFIT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. WE DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE TAKING APARTMENT BLOCK AND THEN PUTTING IT OVER IN MOBILE HOME LAW IF WE WANT TO START LOOKING AT DIFFERENT LAWS. AND HOW THEY APPLY TO MOBILE HOMES MANUFACTURED HOUSING WE'D BE GLAD TO PUT ARBITRARILY CHERRY PICK APARTMENT WATER. TO THEN PUT ON MOBILE HOMES WE BELIEVE IS WRONG AND WHEN OUR WATER LAWYERS LOOK AT THIS I'M NOT AN EXPERT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS NOT A UTILITY EXPERT MR LEE STAFFORD NOT UTILITY EXPERTS YET THESE THREE PARTIES ARE ALL WRITING UTILITY LAW WHICH HAS TO DO WITH WATER PAYMENT. IF THIS BILL PASSES NO. MORE SUB METERS WILL EVER BE PUT ON A NO THEIR MOBILE SPACE. BECAUSE THEY WERE LOSE WHY. WHICH MEANS A HIGH AND FIFTY. SPACE ARE MORE THE STATE WHAT CAN. CONTINUE TO USE WATER AT THEIR LEISURE WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE THE CONSERVER THAT LIVE NEXT DOOR. ONE OF THESE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS MAKES LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR. WHY SHOULD YOU PAY AN INFLATED WATER BILL BECAUSE THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR IS USING A LOT OF WATER. WE BELIEVE THIS YOUR BILL SHOULD BE HELD AND WE SHOULD WORK ON IT'S WE CAN COME UP WITH GOOD WATER POLICY. THAT PROVIDE QUALITY WATER FOR THIS WE ASK THAT THE BILL BE HELD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WANNA GO TO JASON I KERN WHO IS ON THE LINE. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE. HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YET CHANGEMAKER. ON BEHALF OF THE PEEING WE ARE OF COURSE OPPOSED AND THEN AB TEMPLATE LINE BUT WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CAN THAT THE- AT LEAST IN PART ONE OUR MOST CAN WITH TO WATER RATES BUT FOR- THE BILL IS IN PROPOSED TO ME IN WILL NOT ALLOW PARK TO THE CAR THE FULL. OF OPERATING IN MAKES THE BLADDER SYSTEM THIRD THERE CAN SO AS YOU AS YOU JUST HEARD MR GOVERNANCE YOU KNOW UNLIKE APARTMENT BUILDING A MOBILE PHONE. HASN'T NEW OF WATER DISTRICT LINE LATERALS AND STUFF LEADERS THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER THE A MINIATURE DISTRICT UTILITY- AND THE PARK IS WHICH FOR ME AN THAT THAT COMES FUNDS IN TWO NINETY. A MEMBER EXPAND PAINS IN A YOU KNOW AT TURKEY JUST FIFTEEN IN ABOUT- MANHATTAN'S THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THESE ARE LARGE- NXP- UNDER FOR APART- SO AT. ASSERTION MADE HERE TODAY BY THE PROPONENTS AND ANY ANALYSIS UP TO SOMEHOW TURNED INTO PURE PROFIT THAT ACCURATE IF YOU BELIEVE ME ONLY CAUGHT THE PARKING SPACE THING IS FROM THEIR MONTHLY UTILITY BILL BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE MONTHLY UTILITY BILL CAPTURES THE UTILITIES FIX CAR NOT THE PARKS- SO WE BELIEVE IT'S ENTIRELY REASONABLE FOR PARKS YOU CAN USE THE CHARGES THAT OUR PRESIDENT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PAYING AS A BENCHMARK. WHAT THEY THEMSELVES SHOULD SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT TO COVER THESE COSTS IT IS NOT A CHARGE THEN STEP BY THE PARKING SOUNDS THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO THE UTILITY FOR IT- SO FOR THESE REASONS BECOMES PART OF THE BILL I THINK I THINK PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WON'T ALLOW RECOVERING COSTS WE UNFORTUNATELY OF THE MAIN OF HOMES AND ARE. ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S NOW TO. MEMBERS OF. THE WISH TO- EXPRESS YOUR SUPPORT OF TO THIS BILL. C. KNOWN IN THE CA ROOM THREE STATE. OPERATOR OF COULD PLEASE.

THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN SIXTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENTS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE TWENTY ANY DISCUSSION MR COUNTY. I YEAH I AGREE WITH WHAT- YOUR BILL SEEKING TO DO IS REALLY WHY I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU AN ADDRESS THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED- WITH A BY THE OPPOSITION IF THERE'S ROOM TO WORK THERE- ON NOT ADDRESSING THOSE GOING FORWARD. I JUST HIGHLY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TURN IT OVER TO BRUCE STANTON WAS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES MALL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION. IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE. MISTER STANTON. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HERE THAT WATER DELIVERY IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE ENERGY DELIVERY OF GAS AND ELECTRIC IT IS HEAVILY REGULATED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WATER IS NOT IS A MATTER OF FACT A LITTLE OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE CPUC BEING TWITTER AT. THIS VERY ISSUE ALONG WITH OTHERS CONCLUDED THAT THEY COULD NOT ADDRESS IT BECAUSE WATER DELIVERY HAPPENS IT'S FAR TOO MANY WAYS ON MY GAS ELECTRIC YEAH USABLE SYSTEMS PRIVATE WELLS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THESE WATER SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN PUT IT TO THE GROUND BEFORE THE PARK OPENS. AND MOST ALL PARKS IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT START OUT BEING SET METER PARKS. THE WATER LINE YOU'RE PUT IN PERHAPS BY MUNICIPAL- WATER COMPANIES PERHAPS BY THE PARK OWNER IN ALL DIFFERENT MATTERS OF SPEAKING WE DON'T KNOW. BUT THE POINT IS THAT WHEN THOSE SYSTEM DURING THE GROUND IN THEIR NOT SO PETER IF THEY BREAK THE PARK OWNER HAS TO FIX THAT PERHAPS AND THE WAY THAT THEY'RE COMPENSATED IS THROUGH. INCREASED RATS THROUGH PASS THROUGHS THAT ARE ALLOWED IN LONG TERM LEASES. OR WHEN THEY BRING ADMINISTRATIVE RAN HEARINGS OR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PASSED THROUGH HEARINGS IN LOCAL RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS. WHEN THEY SUB METER THE WATER NOTHING CHANGES THEY THEY STILL ARE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION FROM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SOURCES. SO STATE NOW THAT IF THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE CUSTOMER CHARGE TO EVERY SINGLE SPACE IN THE PARK. MULTIPLYING WHAT THEY PAY BY THE NUMBER OF SPACES THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR SYSTEMS IS JUST WRONG. THAT THAT. JUST DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WHEN PARK MANAGEMENT. READ METERS THEY ONLY HAVE TO WALK A FEW FEET BETWEEN THE METERS TO DO SO. THE ONLY ITEM REALLY THAT THE PARK OWNER- IT BECOMES RESPONSIBLE FOR ON A NEW BASIS WOULD BE THE PETER ITSELF AND THERE ARE MANY PARKS WHERE RESIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY CHARGED. THE COST TO INSTALL THE METERS AS WELL. AND THEY PAY AGAIN CA RATS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PASS THROUGHS WHEN RECORDS WILL JURISDICTIONS TO THE PROVISIONS THAT THOSE STATUTES ALLOW. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS PROJECT THE UNFAIR REPLICATION OF THESE CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGES. OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFLATE. THEM WRONGFULLY. THIS SHARES LIKE ONE OF THE WITNESSES ONCE FOR THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK. TO RESPOND TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. YEAH OWNERS OF THE ONES WHO PUT IN THE SYSTEM IS WHEN THE PARKS ARE BUILT MUNICIPALITIES DON'T PUT IN THE CPC DOESN'T PUT IT IN IF YOU WANT TO GRANDFATHER IN THE OLD SYSTEMS LIKE MISTER STANTON JUST SAID AND GOING FORWARD FOR NEW YOU COULD DO FINE GRANDFATHER IN EVERY SYSTEM LET THEM LIVE UNER THE NEW RULES AND IF YOU WANT TO APPLY NEW SEPARATE SUB METERING RULES TO NEW SUBMARINE AND SUB METERS THEN DO SO BUT MR STANTON LITERALLY JUST SAID BUT ALL OF THESE CHARGES CAN BE RECOVERED BY OWNERS. THROUGH A CURRENT PROCEDURES WHICH ARE GOVERNMENT APPROVED PROCEDURES SO THERE ARE NO ARBITRARY CHARGES THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SAYING IN THE END AT THE SUPPOSITION OF THE BILL HE LITERALLY JUST ADMITTED THAT ALL OF THE CHARGES FOR PASS THROUGHS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROVEN RIGHT CONTROL- YOU GET THE MUNICIPALITIES TO APPROVE IT SO ALL OF THESE CHARGES ARE PROVED THERE ARE NO ARBITRARY RATES THAT OWNERS JUST TACK ON TO BILLS ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS READ THE SEVEN METRE BILL THE SUB METER AND SERVICE THE SYSTEM WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE UTILITY SYSTEM IF YOU WANT. GET US OUT OF THE WATER SYSTEM HAVING AN MISS APART MUNICIPALITIES AND SI PC TAKE A SOBER AND GET US OUT LIKE YOU DOING ON THE TRICITY THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND HAVE THE RESIDENTS DIRECTLY SERVED BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN'T JUST PROPORTIONALLY MAKE AN OWNER LOSE MONEY ON THE DELIVERY OF WATER FOR SYSTEMS HAD. IN PLACE FOR THIRTY FORTY AND FIFTY YEARS. THANK YOU SO I YEAH I TAKE IT IS YOUR INTENT WAS REALLY NOT TO IMPOSE THAT SORT OF BURDEN ON- ON THE OWNER BUT YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT THAT. THE RESIDENT HERE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT. OVER CHARGE SO I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST. I ENCOURAGE- YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE AND THAT THEY- COST RECOVERY IS- IS ALLOWED TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE. HI COMMENTS MISTER MISTER. SO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE GRAZED HER ANKLE CONCERNS I HAVE AND I HAVE A UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS WATER SYSTEM ISSUE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUTSIDE THE METER AND INSIDE THE METER WITH THE MOBILE HOME PARK AS WELL AS APARTMENTS CONDOMINIUMS TOWN HOMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ASSEMBLY HEARING ISSUE GOES BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOES- INTO TIERED WATER RATES. DAYS THAT WHEN THEY BILL THIRTY SIX DAYS INSTEAD OF THIRTY DAYS AND DON'T CHANGE THE ALLOCATION AMOUNT- THAT CAN LEAD TO AS MUCHAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OVER PAYMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND IT DOES NEED TO BE CONSTANTLY REPAIRED AND RIGHT NOW THE MOBILE HOME OWNERS THE OWNERS. HAVE TO SOMEHOW REACHING THAT ANGER AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND CHARGING MORE THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN GET BEHIND THE TRYING TO ELIMINATE IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WOULD GET THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP THAT OTHER THAN DOING MASSIVE ASSESSMENTS. ON PEOPLE WHEN. THEY HAVE TO DO A FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REPAIR AND I DON'T THINK THE MOBILE HOME OWNERS- WOULD TAKE KINDLY DO THAT EITHER- SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THOSE INTERESTING ISSUES WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING RIPPED OFF MAYBE ON ONE HAND BUT AT THE SAME TIME- YOU KNOW THESE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THERE ARE LARGE AND- AND THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS SET UP RIGHT NOW THEY NEED TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE A MAINTENANCE FUNDS FOR THAT AND- IF THEY HAVE H. AWAY FEES OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF TIMES EVERYTHING GETS PUT INTO- SO- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS IS. YOU KNOW WATER MEET CHARGE I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE TO DO SO. SIDE I'M I'M A BIT WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT- IF YOU HAVE IF YOU CAN ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THESE OTHER ISSUES- BEFORE I CAN SUPPORT IT FOR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO ANY COMMENTS AND CLOSE YES I'LL CLOSE WITH US SAYING THANK YOU MR SAJID THANK YOU FOR CALLING FOR YOUR A VERY VALID CONCERNS LIKE OUR BILL IS NOT TO MAKE IT SO THAT. BURKE OWNERS CAN NO LONGER RECUPERATE FAIRLY THE COSTS OF UP KEEPING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NOT THE GOAL OF THE BILL. I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED ON WITH THE COMMITTEE MAKE IT MUCH MORE CLEAR IN THAT. IN THAT REGARD. WE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO DRESS OF THESE CONCERNS LIKE THE TIERED WATER BILLING SYSTEM. AND BEING REIMBURSED FOR OTHER MANAGEMENT COST. AT THE TUNE OF EITHER FOUR DOLLARS SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER MONTH OR- 25% OF THE BILL WHICHEVER IS LOWER. I MEAN AND IF WE LOSE TO YOU KNOW THESE COSTS CAN REALLY STACK UP RIGHT. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FAIRLY ABLE TO MAKE IT SO THAT MOBILE ARKEMA'S. CAN MAINTENANCE SYSTEMS AND PROVIDE WATER TO OLDER RESIDENTS IN THERE WITHOUT. HAVING ARBITRARY FEES THAT SOME OF. OUR SOME OF OUR- CALLERS COMMENT AND TALK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD BE EGREGIOUS. AND UNFAIR. I NIGHT AND I DO BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION THEY SAY YOU KNOW THEY DO. NOT WANT TO BE THERE IS A PROFITEERING OFF OF PEOPLE'S WATER BILLS. AND I THINK THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING RIPPED OFF. AND MAKE SURE IS THERE'S A BALANCE THAT PEOPLE SO MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING. WITH OPPOSITION. TO KEEP. TRACK OF IT ALL. THANK YOU BRING BY TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO SAY THE AUTHOR APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS I THINK- WORLD TRY TO STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO. ENSURE WANT TO SEE RENTERS FACING EXORBITANT WATER SERVICE CHARGES BUT WE ALSO. KNOW THAT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OWNERS ARE RECEIVING. UNFAIR SERVICE CHARGES FOR WHAT THEY'RE PROVIDING- APPRECIATE YOU ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO MOVE IT I THINK CLOSER TO A BOUNCE. OPPOSITE THINK THERE'S STILL A BIT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT- I KNOW YOU ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE AND- WITH YOU TAKING THE MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR THIS COMMITTEE I'M- PREPARED TO SUPPORT. MOVING THIS FORWARD- LET ME ASK. MR ANY OTHER COMMENTS BECAUSE OUR MOTION WITH THIS BEFORE. THEIR SECOND. SECOND OF MADAM SECRETARY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED IT CHILLED BY CHIU ICE AIRTEL VOTING SEE OUR TURNOUT VOTING GABRIEL KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN I COOK SILVA. COOKS OF THE ICE WICKES WICKES I THANK YOU BILLS OUT. WITHOUT HER FINAL ITEM IS- FILE ITEM TO AB NINE SEVEN EIGHT PRESENTED BY OUR COLLEAGUE MS CREEK SILVA. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND WE ARE NOT IN THE EVENING YET SO THAT IS A GOOD THING I JUST WANT TO START BY MAKING SOME GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT HOUSING WE ARE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE KNOW. HOUSING HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS OVER THE LAST DECADE FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY WOULD BY WHETHER IT BE A SMALL HOME OR- MOBILE HOME IN CASE AND BELIEVE THAT. THEIR AMERICAN DREAM OF OWNING THEIR HOME IN RETIRING WOULD BE SAFE. AND YET WE HAVE SEEN THINGS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. ALL OF US WORK UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WALK THE STREETS OF THE GRID HERE AND SEE RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. SOME OF THE MOST DEVASTATING IMAGES THAT YOU COULD SEE ACROSS THE WORLD WHICH ARE LITERALLY PEOPLE LYING ON THE STREETS. SOME WITH THE SLEEPING BAG SOME WITH NOTHING AROUND THEM AND SOME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW MENTALLY IF THEY ARE ALIVE OR NOT. LITERALLY UNLESS WE GO UP TO THEM. AND CHECK. AND THIS IS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO SACRAMENTO IT'S ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL CAME. TO ME LAST SESSION WHEN IN MY HOMETOWN OF FULLER TEN. THE LA PAZ MOBILE HOME WAS BOUGHT BY OF. OWNER A NEW OWNER AND RENTS WERE RAISED CLOSE HOME PARK SITS ON LAND IN FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM SO IT WAS BOTH. CITIES ISSUE THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AT THE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL OF WHAT COULD BE DONE AND HERE AT THE STATE WE WERE IN FACT LOOKING AT A RANGE RENT STABILIZATION BILL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO I BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER. THAT BILL DID PASS BUT MOBILE HOMES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN IT. LAST YEAR WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO TRY TO BRING FORWARD SOME TYPE OF. SOLUTION FOR THE THIS NOT ONLY THIS MOBILE HOME BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE PEOPLE UP HERE WHO DO THEIR JOBS WELL WHETHER THEY'RE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OR LOBBYISTS AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO MY BILL ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB ADVOCATING FOR THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT THEY REPRESENT. WHETHER THEY BE THE MOBILE HOME OWNERS AND MY JOB IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN. EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSED HOUSE WE ALREADY HAVE AN ISSUE OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT HOUSED AND WE ARE STRUGGLING WE SAT HERE FOR HOURS ON THURSDAY WITH SO MANY BILLS TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND YET WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSED WE STILL DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION TO KEEP THEM HOUSED. SO MY BILL IT IS NOT A SIMPLE BILL IT'S COMPLEX I KNOW SOMETIMES WE SAY IT'S JUST A SIMPLE BILL AND THE TRUTH IS THIS ISN'T A SIMPLE BILL IT IS A DIFFICULT SUBJECT WE'RE PASSIONATE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. WANT TO SEE A RESULT AND I BRING THIS FORWARD AGAIN I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE AS IT'S DIFFICULT TO CHANGE A BILL THAT STARTS IT AS A DIFFICULT BILL AND WE ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS- THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD UPON THE PORTENT POLICY DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE. AND TWENTY NINETEEN RELATED TO RENT STABILIZATION BY EXTENDING THEM TO MOBILE HOME OWNERS. THE MAJORITY OF MOBILE HOMEOWNERS RENT THE LAND THAT THE HOME RESIDES ON. JUST AS WE HAVE RENTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED STATE WIDE MOBILE HOME OWNERS ARE ALSO FACING DRASTIC RENT INCREASES FROM PARK OWNERS. HOW OVER MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING RENT INCREASES FIND THEMSELVES IN VERY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS FIRST MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT. AS THE WORLD THE WORD IMPLIES MOBILE. THEY ARE NOT. ALMOST NONE OF A MORE MOVE LET'S FACE IT THEY'RE NOT MOBILE. MOBILE HOME OWNERS JUST LIKE TRADITIONAL HOMEOWNERS PAY MORTGAGE ON THE HOME THEY ALSO MUST PAY FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS HOME TAXES MANY MOBILE HOME OWNERS ARE SENIORS VETERANS AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ON A FIXED INCOME. THOSE WHO ARE WORKING ARE OFTEN IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND OTHERS RELY ON SOCIAL SECUITY INCOME NOW LET ME GO BACK TO THE FULLER TO AN EXAMPLE. WE HAD PEOPLE COME TO THE FULLERTON CITY COUNCIL. THAT LIVE IN THOSE MOBILE HOMES. AND TALK ABOUT WITHOUT EIGHTY YEAR OLD. VETERANS PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DIALYSIS MANY OF THESE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS SO A 19% RENT INCREASE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND DO THE MATH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY. SO IN SHORT. I'VE INTRODUCED TO THIS BILL FOR RENT STABILIZATION BUT I'VE NARROWED IT. SO INSTEAD OF IT APPLYING TO THE ENTIRE STATE IT WOULD APPLY TO. MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT AREN'T WHO JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS FAR AS WE KNOW FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM ARE THE ONLY ONES BUT I BELIEVE WE THERE ARE A FEW OTHR EXAMPLES THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL NOTE TODAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN THAT INFORMATION BUT I DO WANT TO BE FAIR THIS IS FOR MOBILE HOME. PARKS THAT ARE IN TWO JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE CONNECTED. SO IN OUR CASE. WE HAVE FULLERTON AND ANAHEIM AND IT'S THEY RUN ACROSS CITY LINES BUT THERE COULD BE A FEW MORE BUT THAT IS THE NARROWING OF THE BILL THE NARROWING IS TO APPLY TO THIS VERSUS THE ENTIRE STATE AS WE BROUGHT FORWARD. LAST YEAR. BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS I WILL COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THE OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THE OPPOSITION WE HAD LAST YEAR. AND SIMPLY STATED I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO GET. THE OPPOSITION REMOVED BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR JOB. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE DOING IT EXTREMELY WELL SO I WILL STOP THERE AND INNER DO SO OUR WITNESS. WE COULD GO TO THE TO ME WITNESSES AND SUPPORT MS THE PAPER MAREZ- REPRESENTING THE CITIES OF ANAHEIM AND FULLERTON AND THAT BRIGHT ACOSTA FROM THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. TO THE OPERATOR. YES TO PAY FINES OPEN I DO NOT SEE BRAINCHILD AND. WHEN WE START WITH MR MARIS. HELLO WE CAN HEAR YOU HELLO. OKAY YES BUT MY NAME IS A VERY MERITS AND I DO LIVE IN A TELEVISED I LIVED ON THE ANAHEIM SIDE- WE WERE APPROXIMATELY- ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO BOUGHT BY WHAT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS THEIR PREDATORY BUYER OF MOBILE HOME PARKS. IBAD MOBILE HOME PARKS UP AND RAISES THE RENT ON SENIOR CITIZENS UNTIL THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE THERE- AS HE DID IN HUNTINGTON CLIFFS AND- AND MADE AT THAT TIME OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE HOMELESS. AND WE BASICALLY ARE GOING TO THE SAME THING HERE NOW- MY VET HAS GONE FROM A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM WHEN HE BOUGHT THE PART IN IT'S GOING TO BE TWELVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY IN OCTOBER. SO IT'S ALMOST DOUBLED I AM ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND ALSO HAVE LEUKEMIA AND MY MEDICAL IS NOT FULLY COVERED SO I MEAN I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AT SOME POINT OF WHETHER OR NOT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE. MY TREATMENTS ARE OF COURSE THE HOUSE. I'M MORE APART AS AS SHARON IT'S THAT. OF A SAID IT'S- APPOINTED BY TWO CITIES- WE HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY THINGS DNE HAVE TO GO. THE CITY MEETINGS HAVE TO GO TO TWO DIFFERENT HOUSING OFFICES WE HAVE TO GO TO TWO DIFFERENT CITY COUNCIL. WE HAVE TO GO TO TWO DIFFERENT PLACES WHENEVER WE NEED ANYTHING DONE SO NOTHING EVER IS. YOU KNOW SIMULTANEOUS OR WORKING WELL FOR US- THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY ARE ANAHEIM RESIDENTS. AND IT CITY OF ANAHEIM LITERALLY HAS NOT OFFERED ANY HELP AT ALL TO THE SENIORS IN THIS PART. REPUBLICANS HAVE OFFERED MORE HELP. ANAHEIM'S YEAH HI PEOPLE CANNOT GET THREE MEALS ON WHEELS THE FOURTEEN PEOPLE CAN GET ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR FREE MEALS ON WHEELS. WE ARE COUNTIES HAD TO OPEN A- PARK ENTRY HERE I CLICKED ENTRY. AND WE NEED FIFTY SIX PEOPLE RIGHT NOW EVERY WEEK WITH FOOD THAT I GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO PICK UP. BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO EAT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR RENT- WHEN YOU'RE PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR ITS BASE METAL. AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTY YEARS OLD IT'S EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS IS A PROBLEM. THERE'S A REAL BIG PROBLEM. WE TRIED TO WORK WITH OUR LANDLORD. AND WHAT HE DID WAS GET TEN YEAR LEASES FOR EVERYBODY THAT LOCKED THEM INTO INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF INCREASES THE CAN'T BE PAID FOR. AND AGAIN IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT'S THE PLAN FOR JUST MAKING SURE WE GET FIFTEEN YEARS OUT AND THEN AFTER WE'RE ALL GONE YOU CAN BUILD CONDOS. WHICH IS AT OF HOTEL IS WHAT HE DID IN HUNTINGTON BEACH- WE HAVE A ONE SITUATION THAT I REALLY LIKE TO SHARE. WITH YOU THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST. WE A NEIGHBOR MINE TO UP TO HAVE TO STAY ON. HIS COMMITMENT. CHAU OR HER CLOSE. IT AND SHE HAD A MOBILE HOME THERE. WHEN MR SO. THE NEW OWN BOUGHT THE PARK HE RAISED EVERY. MATCH TO THE POINT SHE COULD KEEP UP SHE GOT THE- AND HE OFFERED THE ALL SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO. OUT THEY WERE ALL BEHIND IN. AND GO TO LOSE THEIR- SHE BOUGHT HERE. BECAUSE THIS IS A- NEXT AVAILABILITY. HE HAVE TO BE WE DON'T HAVE LAKE DON'T HAVE. IT'S A- PARK. IN WHEN SHE WHEN HE RIGHT HERE SHE THOUGHT SHE'D BE SAID. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. THIS MAN HAS BOUGHT THE PARK. OKAY SO LOOKED PREDICT ASIDE WE CAN'T OF. THESE INCREASE. SHE FINALLY DECIDED SHE WOULD JUST GO TO SELL HE WAS. IT HER. PAYMENTS AND THEIR- TO PAY OFF. THE MONEY WAS THIRTY. WHICH SOLD OUT OF THE- AND- SHE'S OKAY PLACE ON A- WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WHEN SHE WAS SO STRESSED OUT AND SO AFRAID OF LOSING HER HOME AGAIN. WE FOUND HER DEAD TO THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY MORNING IN HER HOUSE BECAUSE SHE JUST. DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE AND DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE WILL TO FIGHT ANYMORE. WHAT'S THE WORST IN HERE PEOPLE THAT ARE SO DESPERATE. PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT ARE SICK THEY'RE HAVING HEART ATTACKS THE PARAMEDICS- IN HERE EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF THE STRESS THE PEOPLE ARE FEELING. WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESS AT EIGHTY IN YOUR ON DIALYSIS WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESS ON EIGHTEEN A WITH EASY AND YOU NEED A WHEELCHAIR. I MEAN THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO THERE'S NO SUBSIDIZED HOUSING ANYMORE THERE'S NO LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR SENIORS ANYMORE. WE NEED TO STAY IN OUR HOMES WE NEED SOME HELP WE NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP PREDATORY BUYERS FROM JUST COMING IN HERE AND TAKING THE LETTERS OUT FROM UNDER US BECAUSE WE HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. IN IN OUR SITUATION IS. IF. I CAN ASK ARAMBULA PLEASE. OKAY WE'RE IN TWO DIFFERENT YOUR SIX WE TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF FROM. AND WE NEED HELP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME NOW GO TO THE SECOND WITNESSES MR COST ON THE LINE. I DON'T SEE HIM DIE OPEN CURRENTLY OKAY F. NOT LET'S GO TO THE MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES- MR CHRIS WEISS SAKE OF REPRESENTING THE WESTERMAN FACTOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES- HERE IN PERSON. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THIS REPAIR MEMBERS TO PLEASURE TO SEE YOU- FIRST OF ALL WMA WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO. ADDRESS THAT HOWEVER THIS BILL IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. THIS BILL LIMITS RENT INCREASES TO MOBILE HOME PARKS ACROSS TO CITY LINES 23% PLUS 5% OF CPI. AS OUR OPPOSITION LETTER STATES MOBILE HOME PARK SHOULDN'T BE HELD TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS. THEN OTHER RENTAL HOUSING UNITS BARTENDERS HAVE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PART. THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PARK AMENITIES THEY LIVE BY THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR HEART PARKS PROVIDE A SAFE AND SECURE HOUSING FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. HOUSING IS A KEY PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED MORE OF IT. WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE DEVELOPED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE WE NEED MORE FOR HER PORTABLE HOUSING OPTIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS. BUT NINE SEVENTY EIGHT WON'T HELP THAT SITUATION. AT LEAST UNDER FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THAT THE AUTHOR RECOGNIZED THERE WOULD VETO VACANCY DEACON KROLL. WE UNDERSTAND THAT RESIDENTS ARE STRUGGLING BUT WE HOPE THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT PARK OWNERS ARE STRUGGLING AS WELL. WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE SAFE AND SECURE HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS. BUT THIS AB NINETY SEVENTY EIGHT SETS A PRECEDENT THAT WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE OPERATING OUR PARKS. THAT MAKE PEOPLE DIFFER FOR THE PANDA. THANK YOU AND I JUST ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT THIS BILL DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS AND WILL BLOW UP A BILL THAT YOU JUST VOTED ON- THE BENNETT BELL AGE SIXTY ONE. AND FOR THAT AND MANY OF THE REASONS WE OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINE JASON OCCURRED REPRESENTED THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATE JACKSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE NPA. YEAH WHAT IT LOOKS START IGNORE THANK NOT LOOKING WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID THE OUT THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THE PROVISION IN THE BILL THE DEAL BEING SPENT AT LEAST HAS BEEN NARROWED TO. PARKS IN TWO DIFFERENT CITIES THAT'S SAID- YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED WITH WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT WE'RE SPENDING- WHICH INCLUDES OBVIOUSLY A LOWER ABOUT BRITAIN CREASE AND WHAT WE- APPROPRIATE FOR APARTMENTS AND OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING. BUT IT IN ADDITION TO THAT- SOMETHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM W. MAY TOUCHED ON WHICH IS THANK YOU CAN BE CONTROL SO TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PERSPECTIVES- CRITICAL SYSTEM VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL- IN IN THE CONTEXT OF A MOBILE HOME PARK AND IT IS TO ANY OTHER TYPE OF HOUSING IN THE STATE BECAUSE- RESIDENTS. BY AND LARGE OWN THEIR HOMES AND SIMPLY WITH THE SPACE BENEATH IT AND SO- EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT DEFERS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW. THE FACE SPACE FOR IT TO BE RESET TO THE MARKET RATE UPON VACANCY THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU THINK ANY CONTROL- SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND THIS IS A THOUSAND NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT WE AS PARK OWNERS CLAIM IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED IN LITERATURE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH. YOU AND HAVE WITH WITH MANY OF YOUR STAFF IT'S ESTABLISHED IN JURISDICTIONS WITH THINKING THINKING CONTROL. WELL YOU'VE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED DISAPPEARED ENTRY TO THE SECOND GENERATION OF PARKER- WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT I THINK THAT THE HOMEOWNER. WHO WHOSE FACE IS RENT CONTROL WELL I ACTUALLY DIDN'T DO IT- IT HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE FEEDING TO THE PERSON THEY'RE SELLING TO WILL BE ENABLED SO THAT IN THE PRICE OF THEIR HOME. SO WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING WHEN WE WHEN WE ALLOW CAN'T CONTROL 2% IS WE'RE INFLATING THE COST OF HOUSING- AND IN FACT FOR THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE- AT BEYOND. THAT- WHAT. CAN WE DON'T THE- MINUTES OF CONFINED FROM. DEVELOPMENT IN COURT. MANY PARK- WE- DID THAT AMENDMENT COUPLE SICKENING. WOULD APPLY RENT CONTROL HOMES PARK. ARE STATEWIDE THEY SAID A DIFFERENT TRAIN AND GET LIEU. FOR TENANTS LIVING IN SAME. AND BACK THE- WELL AND OTHERS WE REMAIN TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT NINE SEVEN EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE IN Q. IT'LL JUST BE ONE MOMENT FOR THAT LINE. IT'LL JUST BE ONE MORE MOMENT WHEN WE GET ON THAT MY NUMBER. ONE SEVENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD.

RIGHT FIFTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CREAM GREETS HIM TO HAPPEN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANKS LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COMMENTS. OUR MOTION WITH THIS BEFORE THEIR SECOND. THIS ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR DILIGENCE ON THIS AS THE LEAD AUTHORED AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE WE- FRANKLY- THIS WAS IT A CHALLENGING TOPIC A COUPLE YEARS AGO IF IT HAD BEEN UP TO ME. WE WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW WE EXTENDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO MOBILE HOMEOWNERS BUT- WE'VE DECIDED TO DEFER THAT TO THIS DISCUSSION I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN REALLY DILIGENT AND- TRYING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD APPRECIATE YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH OUR STAFF ON THIS. AND FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE PUT FORTH IN A VERY MUCH THINK THAT- DURING THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND RENTAL CRISIS WE NEED TO GIVE ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME OR NOT- SOME SENSE OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU. YOU PROPOSED A NARROWING THE SIGNIFICANTLY TO- TO REALLY TRY TO WORK IT OUT OF FOR SOME OF THESE PARKS IN YOUR DISTRICTS WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT ANALYSTS ARE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. OF COURSE. LIKE I NEED TO EXPLAIN- MY ISSUE IS NUMBER ONE THIS IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE AND FINANCIAL WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S HUGE AND IT'S OUR OWN MAKING YEARS YEARS YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND SO THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE GOING TO NECESSARILY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ARE JUST BANDAIDS THAT WERE THROWN OUT TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE- YOU KNOW IT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I YOU KNOW I REALLY FEEL LIKE. THE LOCAL AGENCIES NEEDED YOU KNOW STEP UP AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE- WHEN SOMEBODY COMES IN AND DOES A YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING FOR THAT'S WHAT THOSE WE'RE GONNA PUT THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO WORK CITY COUNCIL PEOPLE ARE USED TO BE ONE OF THEM- THAT'S OUR JOB. AND SO AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO NARROW THIS DOWN STEP BUT IT'S STILL KIND OF A BLANKET APPROACH. ARE THEY CAN BE. IT CAN BE PRETTY BACKED BY SOMEBODY ELSE ON TO IT AND THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S REALLY JUST WHAT MY CONCERN IS- WE NEED THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO STEP UP FOR AND OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DID WRONG. TO CREATE A SUPPLY AND DEMAND BECAUSE WE CREATED A MONSTER PROBLEM IN THE SUPPLY SIDE WE. NEED TO FIX IT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I'M JUST GONNA SAY TO THAT FOR A MOMENT- I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE A SUPPLY DEMAND PROBLEM- THE CHALLENGES WE ARE WE ARE AND WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID MASS EVICTIONS AND WHAT WE DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHAT WE'VE DONE AND THIS PANDEMIC AS FAR AS PROVIDING EVICTION PROTECTIONS AS WE SAID WE HAVE A SUPPLY DEMAND PROBLEM BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE PREVENT MASS EVICTIONS- CERTAINLY AGREE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES NEED TO STEP UP THERE THE REALITY IS WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF LOCAL AGENCIES HAVEN'T AND I BELIEVE I DON'T WANNA SPEAK FOR THE AUTHOR- BUT THE FACT THAT SHE HAS NARROWED THIS SO INCREDIBLY- IT NARROWLY TO A COUPLE OF JURISDICTIONS IN HER DISTRICT RATHER THAN TRYING TO APPLY THE STATE WIDE. IS A RECOGNITION THAT TO- THAT THAT MAYBE WE FIGURE THIS OUT FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE COULD APPLY IF THIS WERE I THINK A STATE WIDE APPLICATION I THINK THAT YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD- I WOULD APPRECIATE AYE AYE IT WOULD RESONATE A BIT MORE BUT I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THAT- THE AUTHOR. HAS PROPOSED- APPLYING THIS BILL TO THE TWO INCORPORATED CITIES SAID- THAT SHE'S LAID OUT IN THIS BILL SO WITH THAT AGAIN. HAPPY TO SUPPORT TO MOVE THIS FOR TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. OUT TO THE AUTHOR ANY FINAL COMMENTS. YES AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE- AS A WHOLE ALL OF US COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND I AND F. I WAS GOING TO BE A RANKING COMMITTEES OF IMPORTANCE I WOULD SAY HOUSING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMITTEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I FEEL LIKE THE WORK THAT WE- SEE BEFORE US- THERE'S MANY WAYS TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE AS WE SAID IN THE COMMITTEE HERE. WITH SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUES SO- YOU KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO REALLY QUICKLY TELL YOU KNOW YESTERDAY I HAD A CALL FROM A CATHOLIC PRIEST IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT THE RV'S. MANY OF THEM PARKING AND FULLER TEN BECAUSE OTHER CITIES ARE NOT ALLOWING- SO DO WE ENFORCE THEIR- PRODUCT CALL WITH THE JUDGE DAVID CARTER WHO IS. NOW BECOME. LEGENDARY FOR WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND NOW IS ALL ABOUT IN. LOS ANGELES- OUT ON SKID ROW. AND SO WE AS LOCALS COUNCIL. COUNTY PEOPLE STATE WE CONTINUE TO MEET AND MEET AND TALK AND TALK AND TRY TO PUT MONEY AT IT AND YET. YOU KNOW SOMETHINGS ARE WORKING SOMETHING'S ARM ARK THIS BILL IS NARROWED TO TWO DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. IN MY OWN DISTRICT AND IT IS A LIFELINE IT'S A LIFELINE TO SAY. IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING NOW TO POTENTIALLY KEEP EVEN MORE VULNERABLE PEOPLE THEN IT'S A STEP FORWARD. AND YET I 100% AGREE WITH YOU PRODUCTION IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GET SOLVED ANY TIME SOON. AND I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR LISTENS TO US THIS YEAR AND SIGNS PRODUCTION BILLS BUT THAT BEING SAID I ASKED FOR AN- AYE VOTE FOR TO DAY FOR THIS BILL AB NINE SEVENTY EIGHT.
