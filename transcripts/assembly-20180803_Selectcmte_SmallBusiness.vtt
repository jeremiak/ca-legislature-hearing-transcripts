STREAMING --

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.080

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.082

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:18.685
ON SMALL BUSINESS AND

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.085
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.420
I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURA

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.389

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.959
REYES.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.927
WHO IS --

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:28.595
I'M ONE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.363
I'M AFTER THIS HEARING WE'RE

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.930
GOING TO BE DOING A SIMILAR

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.933
HEARING IN THE CENTRAL COAST --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.567
AND WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GO

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.236
TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IF

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.171
THEY'RE INTERESTED IN HAVING US

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:38.438
AS WELL.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.273
OF THE REASON THAT I HAD ASKED

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.041
YOU CAN --

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.977
TO HOWEVER A COMMITTEE ON SMALL

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.979
BUSINESS IS BECAUSE AFTER BEING

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:46.579
IN SACRAMENTO FOR ALMOST TWO

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.415
YEARS I'M IN MY FIRST TERM.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.283
I NOTICE THAT LARGE BUSINESSES

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.051
HAVE A VERY LARGE VOICE --

00:00:52.118 --> 00:01:00.026
WHATEVER WHERE ARE LOOKING TO

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:00.560
ADOPT A NEW REGULATION --

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.161
WE HEAR A LOT FROM OUR LARGER

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:01.461
BUSINESSES.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.162
BUT WE DON'T HEAR AS MUCH FROM

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:02.829
THE SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S HARD

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.030
FOR THEM TO HAVE A UNIFIED VOICE.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.232
WHEN IT COMES TO STATEWIDE

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.201
POLICY [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:08.668
AND WHAT'S [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.405
EASY. TO COMPLY WITH FOR VERY

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.040
LARGE BUSINESS.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.342
CAN BE A HUGE HURDLE FOR SMALLER

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.044
BUSINESS.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.046
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WE ALWAYS

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.015
HEAR THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.050
AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:24.717
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SPEND

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.352
ENOUGH TIME REALLY LISTENING TO

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.188
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR ONE

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:28.788
THING THE LANDSCAPE OF SMALL

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.390
BUSINESSES HAS CHANGED OVER THE

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.125
YEARS -- I

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.093
THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN TO THINK

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.029
OF OUR SMALLEST ENTREPRENEURS

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:36.563
THE ONE PERSON TO PERSON

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.164
BUSINESSES AS ALSO BEING

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.099
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS AND SMALL

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:40.400
BUSINESSES.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.302
AND THEY ARE AFFECTED VERY VERY

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.270
DIFFERENTLY TO LICENSURE

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:48.107
REGULATION TAX STRUCTURE ALL OF

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:48.775
THE THINGS THAT AFFECT BUSINESS

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.143
VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN LARGE

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.178
BUSINESSES AND EVEN FOR A LARGER

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:52.579
SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.581
SO TODAY WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.416
DO IS TO HEAR FROM A LOT OF THE

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.251
EXPERTS FROM FROM SOME FROM SOME

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:58.885
OF OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES AS

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.188
WELL. TO HERE ABOUT THEIR ISSUES

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.257
ABOUT BARRIERS IN OPPORTUNITIES

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.092
FROM SACRAMENTO.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.961
SO THAT WE CAN BETTER CRAFT

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.096
LEGISLATION AND BE MORE

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:10.697
SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:11.998
BUSINESSES.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:12.532
NOW I KNOW THAT DIFFERENT

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.300
BUSINESS SECTORS HAVE VERY

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.069
DIFFERENT NEEDS WHAT'S A BIG

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:16.736
ISSUE TO A MASSAGE PARLOR MIGHT

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.505
BE COMPLETE NON ISSUE TO A

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.006
RESTAURANT.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.041
SO WHAT I'M HOPING TO DO IS TO

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.177
FIND COMMONALITY IF NOT ACROSS

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.145
THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF SMALL

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.114
BUSINESS AT LEAST FROM A LARGE

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:28.515
BUSINESS SECTORS.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.517
AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT AT THE END

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.185
OF THESE HEARINGS THAT MISS

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.287
RANSOM MYSELF AND MAYBE SOME OF

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.222
THE OTHER MEMBERS FROM NORTHERN

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.024
CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING TO BE.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:38.558
PAID IN THE NEXT HEARING.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.159
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION PERHAPS

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.928
BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR OR AT THE

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.930
VERY LEAST ARE MORE SENSITIVE

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.065
I'M AS WE HEAR BILLS HONEST

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:46.666
DIFFERENT ISSUES COME IN FRONT

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.067
OF US.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.003
SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN TO

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.038

SIX THOUSAND PROGRAM GRADUATES

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:44.234

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.242
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THE STATS I

CAN SHARE WITH YOU.

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.177
AFTER -- AT

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:54.811
SIX MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE

00:56:54.878 --> 00:57:00.250
PROGRAM. 67% OF A OF A SCHOLARS

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:02.018
HAVE INCREASED OUR REVENUE AND

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:04.053
YOU'RE LOOKING AT COMPARING THEM

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.721
TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF FORTY

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:10.093
SEVEN PER. 47% HAVE CREATED JOBS.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.462
AND COULD THIS IS COMPARED TO

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:16.132
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF TWENTY

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.201
FIVE AT THIRTY MONTHS AFTER

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.270

INCREASED THEIR REVENUES.

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.174
AGAIN COMPARED TO THE 47%

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.109
NATIONALLY AND THEN 57% HAVE

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.044
CREATED JOBS.

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:30.313
SO THE PARTISAN RESULTS CONSISTS

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.482
ONLY SHOW THE POSITIVE FAN AND

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.317
DURING A FACT THAT THE PROGRAM

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.052
HAS ON THE ECONOMY.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.288
THERE IS HOWEVER A COPY OUT OF

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.156
THIS -- VERY

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:40.757
NEEDED AN EFFECT PROGRAM IN MY

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:44.060
OPINION.

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:44.727
IT IS NOT INEXPENSIVE TO DELIVER

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:48.031
THIS PROGRAM --

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:48.631
AND DELIVER PROGRAM WAS SUCH

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:52.235
HIGH QUALITY AND AND THANKS TO

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:52.836
THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE

PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM DO

00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.076
NOT HAVE TO PAY A DYING.

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.078
SO THIS IT'S THEY RECEIVE A

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:02.712
SCHOLARSHIP FROM GOLDMAN SACHS

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.113
FOUNDATION --

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.282
MANY ALSO WONDER WHAT IS THE

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:10.053
SECRET SAUCE TO THIS PROGRAM --

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:10.587
WITH GOLDMAN SACHS SUPPORT

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:12.255

AND REALLY FOCUS ON FOUR KEY

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.094
INGREDIENTS.

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.363
WE FOCUS ON ENTREPRENEUR GROWTH

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:24.100

PEER TO PEER LEARNING WHERE

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:26.402

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.371

CHALLENGES INTO THE CLASSROOM.

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:34.077
AND THAT THEY CAN APPLY WHAT

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.179
THEY LEARN IN CLASS IMMEDIATELY

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.981
IN THE OF BUSINESS THE VERY NEXT

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:38.648
DAY WE SEEN THIS HAPPEN OVER AND

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.016
OVER AGAIN.

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:42.285
THE CURRICULUM IS DIRECTLY

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.287

THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS

00:58:46.756 --> 00:58:48.024
CAPITAL.

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.260
THERE'S ALSO VERY VIGOROUS

00:58:50.326 --> 00:58:52.362
MEASURE ANY MEASUREMENT AND

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:54.230
EVALUATION SYSTEM IN PLACE TO

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:56.232
TRACK AND MONITOR THE BUSINESS

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.034
OWNERS.

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:00.236
WE CONTINUE TO OUTREACH TO THEM

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.205

OF BUSINESS BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:14.050

AT YOUR BUSINESS SO THIS

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:24.327
BUSINESS.

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.496
UP TEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:30.066
PROGRAM COVERS A LOT OF THINGS

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:30.300
THAT --

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:34.103
REALLY IS NOT NECESSARY WHAT.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.972
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T KNOW

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:38.041
IT'S REALLY HELPING THEM LOOK AT

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:40.076
THEIR BUSINESSES VERY

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:42.078
DIFFERENTLY AND BY DOING THAT

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:42.512
WITH THIS PROGRAM.

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:44.447
WE REALLY HELP THE BUSINESSES

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:48.117
GROW.

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.986
IN LOOKING AT FOSTERING

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:52.055
INNOVATION IN SMALL BUSINESSES --

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:54.257
AND INNOVATION IS A KEY THEME IN

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:56.059
THE PROGRAM --

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.994
DATA SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.996
AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.365
OVER 75% OF OUR GRADUATES HAVE

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.200
IMPROVED AN EXISTING PRODUCT OR

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.135
SERVICE.

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.037
OPENED A NEW LOCATION.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:08.638
AND OR HAVE AND LAUNCH A NEW

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.540
PRODUCT AND SERVICE SO THIS IS

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:12.308
SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THEY

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:16.045
GROW AND CREATE JOBS.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.081
WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED --

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.016
WE COULD --

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.018
THAT WOULD HELP US APPROACH THE

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:24.020
QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO FOSTER

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:24.620
INNOVATION AND INCUBATE SMALL

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:28.057
BUSINESS GROWTH.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.159
NUMBER ONE HAVING A GOOD

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.095
PIPELINE IS IMPORTANT TEN

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:32.729
THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES RELY

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.263
ON THE POOL OF QUALIFIED

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.065
APPLICANTS TO FILL A COHORTS.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.267
SO IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED A VERY

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:38.801
STRONG PIPELINE OF SMALL

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:42.071
BUSINESS OWNERS.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.040
SO THE KEY TO A STRONG PIPELINE

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:46.042
IN BUILDING --

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.044
TO HAVE OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:48.544
IS REALLY BUILDING THE

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.079
ENTREPRENEUR ECHOES.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.048
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE LARGER

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:52.682
PICTURE PICTURE BECAUSE NOT ONE

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.384
SIZE FITS ALL IN THIS PROGRAM IS

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:54.550
NOT.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:58.054
FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE GROWTH

01:00:58.121 --> 01:00:58.621
MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.123
DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:00.790
SOME BUSINESS OWNERS DO NOT WANT

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:04.093
TO GROW.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.162
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS LIKE

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:06.662
THE TEN THOUSAND SMALL

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:07.997
BUSINESSES PROGRAM WORKS.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.066
OUT WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS LIKE

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.968
THAT IN THE PIPELINE PROGRAM

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:12.602
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DON'T

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.337
MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE TEN

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.039
THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.207
THE MICHAEL BUSINESSES THAT YOU

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.009
MENTIONED EARLIER --

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:22.178
THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK AND

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:22.812
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:26.082
FOCUS ON PROGRAMS LIKE THE TEN

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:26.716
THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES BUT DE

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.618
SIGN. FOR THE MICHAEL BUSINESSES

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.386
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY NEED TO

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.055
HELP TO GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:36.092
PLEASE LOOK AT REMOVING BARRIERS --

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.027
ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND THEN

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.029
EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF RESOURCE

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:40.329
PARTNERS --

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.465
HAVING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.333
SAW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE S. B.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.202
D. C. A. S. B. A A LOT OF

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.037
CHAMBERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:48.371
CALIFORNIA --

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.540
AND LOTS OF OTHER PARTNERS MAKES

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.075
A DIFFERENCE.

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.210
THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW CAN

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.179
GOVERNMENT INCENTIVIZE A

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.114
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH --

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.049
WITH EXISTING TECHNICALS

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.385
PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.520
FUNDS HOW DO WE SET UP ENCOURAGE

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.255
AND HELP THE CITIES TO

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:08.157
STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE GET

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.093
PLANNING PROCESS.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.028
AND A PERMITTING PROCESS --

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.230
MAKING IT MUCH SIMPLER FOR THOSE

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.232
US STARTING A BUSINESS AND EVEN

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.334
EXISTING BUSINESSES STRUGGLE

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.503
WITH THOSE THE PERMITTING AND

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.271
PROCESS WHEN THEY ARE.

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.273
OPENING ANOTHER LOCATION AND OR

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.209
THEY'RE TRYING TO GROW THEIR

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.010
BUSINESS.

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.279
WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW TO

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:32.215
USE TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:32.615
BUSINESSES LEARN.

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.484
SO SUCH AS INTERACTIVE ONLINE

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:38.087
LEARNING BECAUSE TRAFFIC IS A

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:38.554
REAL ISSUE IN SOUTHERN

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.123
CALIFORNIA.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:42.091
AND THEN LOOKING AT APPS THAT

OF ENTREPRENEURS AND FUTURE

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:58.574
BUSINESS OWNERS OF VERY TECH

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.042
SAVVY.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.311
CITIES ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.180
STRATEGIES TO BRING RESOURCE

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.115
PARTNERS TOGETHER AND ENGAGE

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:06.716

SYSTEM --

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.253
THE ECO SYSTEM GROWING ECO

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:10.786
SYSTEM HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:14.090
ENTREPRENEURS.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:14.790
THE CITIES HAVE TO TAKE RISK AND

WAYS THAT SERVES THE COMMUNITIES

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.061
SO AN EXAMPLE IS THE CITY OF

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.196
LONG BEACH.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.365
WHO IS CURRENTLY TESTING

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:24.133
APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES AS

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.968
PART OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:26.269
BLUEPRINT?

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:28.404
IN BUILDING ECO SYSTEM THEY'VE

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.139
PARTNER WITH AN ENTREPRENEUR TO

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.108
BUILT A CO WORKING SPACE.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:34.243
CITY OWNED PROPERTY FORM THAT

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.078
WAS FORMALLY AN RTA PROPERTY

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.080

LUMBER CITY COLLEGE OFFERS.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.257
SO THE PAPER POP UP PUBLIC

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.159
PARTNERSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT --

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.195
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.996

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.040
RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:04.607
LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDS TO

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.309
INCREASE THAT CAPACITY ACROSS

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.344
THE STATE IN ASSISTING SMALL

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.046
BUSINESSES.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.315
OF ALL LEVELS THAT IS A VERY

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.016
IMPORTANT I THINK BREAKTHROUGH

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.152
FOR AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:18.020
AND AND I WANT --

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.089

THE SCENES IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.231
AND ALSO A VERY FAINT BECAUSE MY

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.299
THANKS TO ADAM ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES VERY

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:38.074
EXCITED.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.243
ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT ROLE

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.044
CAN GOVERNMENT PLAY IN

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.980

AND THEN ENCOURAGING CITIES TO

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.306
ENGAGE WITH THE KAUFMAN

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.208
FOUNDATIONS MAYOR'S CONFERENCE

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:16.045
ENTREPRENEURS ECHOES.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.357
AN ALL TIME LOW THIS ISSUES EVEN

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.159
MORE URGENT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.261
BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:36.165
663% OF NET NEW JOBS AND IS 99%

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:40.102
OF THE U. S. EMPLOYER FIRMS --

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.238
LASTLY WHAT I WANT TO MENTION

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:44.173
THE ISSUE OF WORKFORCE.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.242
OUT OF QUALIFY --

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.210
READY WORKFORCE IT'S AN ISSUE

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.945
THAT COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.114
WITHOUT SMALL BUSINESSES --

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:56.052
HIRING AND TRAINING QUALIFIED

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.087

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:00.222
HAVING THEM OF FINDING THEM AND

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.425
KEEPING THEM IT'S A BAKER VERY A

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.327
TO THEIR GROWTH SO THAT'S AN

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.195
ISSUE THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.097
AN ADDRESS AND FINDING WAYS TO

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:08.531

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:20.009
FEELING THAT PIPELINE.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:20.710

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:28.397
WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MORE

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:30.199
CITIES TO DO IS --

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.468
THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WAS PART

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:38.073
OF THE BLOOMBERG'S A AWARD

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.342
INNOVATION AWARD AND WHAT THEY

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:42.278
DID AS PART OF THAT WAS THE PUT

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.113
OUT AN RFP.

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:46.081
UP TO THE COMMUNITY TO TO

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:50.119
REQUEST FOR IDEAS AND IS YOU

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.288
KNOW MODELS TO HELP THE CITY

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.123
ACTIVATE.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.258
OF PHYSICAL SPACE SAYS TO EXPAND

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.060
AND GROW THE ENTREPRENEUR ECO

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.661
SYSTEM THEY THEY WERE JUST

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.362
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:02.264
IDEAS ARE OUT THERE WHO'S

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.033
WILLING TO WORK.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.068
WITH US AND HOW COULD WE MAYBE --

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:06.569
LOOK AT DOING SOMETHING

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:10.306
DIFFERENT AND OF ONE OF THE

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:10.973
REASONS HE DID THAT'S BECAUSE AT

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.107
SOME R. D. EIGHT PROPERTY THEY

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.043
WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.011
TO HOW DID --

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.247
LOOK WITHIN I MENTIONED OF THE

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:18.847
PROJECT IN THAT CITY OF LONG

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.182
BEACH WHERE --

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.051
THEY HAD ALREADY A PROPERTY.

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:24.553
AND BECAUSE OF WE WERE IN THERE

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.157
TO DELIVER SPD SERVICES THOUGHT

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.259
THE CITY PROVIDES THE HARDWARE

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.027
WHICH IS THE BUILDING WE PROVIDE

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.096
AT THE OF THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.065
THE DIFFERENCE SERVICES.

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:38.067
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.035
TO REALLY OPERATE IT --

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:40.636
YOU KNOW EIGHT TO FIVE MONDAY

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.371
THROUGH FRIDAY OR MAYBE ON

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.073
WEEKENDS.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.241
SO ONE OF THE IDEAS IS HOW DO WE

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.143
DO THAT IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.112
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP --

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:54.116
AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A AN

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:54.683
ENTREPRENEUR IN IN LA BLANK

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.087
SPACES THEY ARE WILLING TO COME

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.989
IN AND OPERATE --

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:02.124
LOCAL WORKING SPACE.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.293
AND WE STRUCTURED SO THAT WE ARE

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.228
NOT IN THE WAY OF A FOR PROFIT

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.063
ENTITY --

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:10.199
GENERATING YOU KNOW.

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:12.067
RUNNING THAT --

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:12.701
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE EXPERTS IT

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.503
TEASES IN RUNNING A CO WORKING

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.138
SPACE -- AS

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.440
PARTNERS THE CITY THEM PROVIDED

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:20.242
SOME INCENTIVES FOR THE

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.378
ENTREPRENEUR AND WE ARE GOING TO

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:26.215
BE LOCATED IN [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:28.150
THIS.

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.019
BEING ABLE TO OFFER DIFFERENT

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.187
ATTRACT SMALL SMALL BUSINESSES

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:32.855
TO THE CITY OF LONG BEACH THAT'S

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.356
AN EXPERIMENT THAT WE ARE

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.058
UNDERTAKING IN LONG BEACH.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.394
I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF PROMISE --

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.396
I'VE SEEN OTHER PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:44.033
PARTNERSHIP WORK --

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:44.700
IT'S IT'S OF THE OF THE PRIVATE

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:48.070
SECTOR HAS RESOURCES IT'S JUST A

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:48.671
MATTER OF HOW DO WE UTILIZE.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:52.207
AND HOW DO WE FLYING WAYS TO

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.043
WORK WITH THEM IT'S VERY HARD

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:54.677
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO WORK

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.378
WITH CITIES BECAUSE OF SO MUCH

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:56.712
BUREAUCRACY.

01:11:56.779 --> 01:12:00.115
IT TAKES PROBABLY TEN TIMES AS

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:02.251
LONG TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT ALL

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:04.253
ENTREPRENEURS HAVE THE STOMACH

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.255
TO DO THAT BUT SOME OF THEM OUT

A HISTORY OF HAVING WORKED FOR

SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY SO MAYBE

YEAR.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:00.268
TWO THOUSAND THE ASSEMBLY PASSED

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:02.337

CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS DAY.

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:08.176
AND EVERY YEAR THANKS TO THE

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:10.111
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS --

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:12.247
WE HAVE HONORED SMALL BUSINESSES

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.182
IN YOUR DISTRICT.

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:16.050
AND THE TWO OF YOU DID THAT THIS

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:18.420
YEAR I THINK HIM ASSEMBLYMAN

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.088
FRIEDMAN'S.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:22.056
HAVE A TYPICAL SMALL BUSINESS

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:22.690
SITUATION THAT THE LAST MINUTE

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:24.058
THEY COULDN'T ATTEND

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:24.359
[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:28.163
BUT SIMON RAYOS YOU LOOK VERY

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.198
ATTRACTIVE IN THIS AND WE TRY

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:32.367
AND LIMIT IT TO SEVENTY FIVE OUT

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.469
OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BUT

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.204
USUALLY RUN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:38.273
EIGHTY AND EIGHTY FIVE ARE.

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.108
THE OTHER THING I WANT.

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:42.210
TO SHARE WITH YOU IS BY

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.012
CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS FIRST.

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:48.049
WE UP PUT THIS TOGETHER AND WE

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:50.118
WILL FOR ME SHIP.

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:50.718
FOR ANY LOCAL CHAMBER IN THE

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.353
INDIVIDUAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.389
ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO PROMOTE

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.124
SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:58.393
AND THE BACK PAGES FOR YOU TO

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.028
PUT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:02.030
IN THAT PARTICULAR DIRECTION.

01:25:02.096 --> 01:25:04.365
BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S NOT

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:06.134
ENOUGH EDUCATION.

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:10.071
ON WHO SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:10.672
AND I WAS SITTING THERE AND I

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.373
WAS THINKING OF YOU KNOW I THINK

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.175
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.077
DEFINITION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.346
AND SMALL BUSINESS AND I THINK

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:20.048
PROBABLY EACH OF SMALL

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:20.548
BUSINESSES HAVE OUR OWN

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.350
DEFINITIONS AND I THINK THAT

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.419
MAKES IT NOT ONLY HARD TO

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.421
GOVERNANCE IT HIT MAKES IT HARD

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:30.091
TO HELP US IN IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.393
BUT I DO WANT TO TALK I WANT TO

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.229
TALK ABOUT ADVOCACY I WANT TO

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.097
GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY.

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:38.433
IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.067
WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL

01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:42.070
BUSINESS --

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:44.005
I WAS ASKED.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:46.174
TO OF WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:46.808
RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:50.111
SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES.

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.180
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.148
DECISIONS I EVER MADE SO I'M

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.117
REALLY FOCUSED ON I CALIFORNIA.

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:58.520
I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING

01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:00.288
ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.223
GET ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS AT

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.125
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.194
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SMALL

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.129
BUSINESS COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:12.300
THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE TO WORK ON

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.269
ALL THE ISSUES SO WHAT WE DO IS

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:18.172
FOLLOW THE WHITE HOUSE DELEGATES --

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:20.041
WE HAVE.

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:20.675
ELEVEN ISSUES COMMITTEES THAT

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:22.310
ARE COMPOSED OF SMALL BUSINESS

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:24.212
OWNERS [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:24.579
THEY DETERMINE.

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.381
STATEWIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.049
WORK ON IN THAT AREA.

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:30.418
SO LET ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:32.053
BIT ABOUT HOW.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.188
BUT THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:36.057
ISSUE IS WORKERS COMP REFORM.

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:40.028
AND AS YOU I THINK BOTH KNOW WE

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:42.196
DO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:46.100
ON HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER AND MY

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.102
NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION ON

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.071
WORKERS COMP REFORM.

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:52.040
IS WE'D LOVE TO THINGS I GUESS

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:52.340
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:56.110
WE WE KNOW WORKER'S COMP OF

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:56.678
THANKS TO THE LITTLE HOOVER

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.079
COMMISSION.

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.181
IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THE

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:00.782
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY GROWING TO

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.083
THE CANDIDATES.

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:06.154
AND SO WE NEED ENFORCEMENT IN IN

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.256
THAT DIRECTION [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:11.960
AND WE ALSO NEED --

01:27:12.026 --> 01:27:14.395
TO LOOK AT THAT WHAT WORKS FOR

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.431
BIG BUSINESS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.166
FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN THE AREA

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:20.034
OF WORKERS COMP.

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:22.270
AND I THINK THEY'RE I THINK

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.072
WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:24.272
THAT.

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:26.441
BUT I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY --

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:30.078
DONE ANYTHING THAT SHOWS SO

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:30.678
MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:32.447
THINK ABOUT IS ENFORCEMENT OF

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:36.050
THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY.

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:36.651
AND MAYBE YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.486
AMOUNT OF MONEY YEAR GIVING THE

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:42.123
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. TO GO AFTER

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.058
WORKERS CONTEST DRIVE.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:46.127
THAT'S NOT BEING USED MAYBE

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:46.594
THERE'S A BETTER WAY.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.529
AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:52.166
YOU ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN.

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:56.070
WE DON'T WANT THE GOOD GUYS.

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.072
THAT ARE.

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:00.208
DOING IT RIGHT. TO BE PENALIZED

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:02.243
FROM A COMP COMPETITION

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:04.379
STANDPOINT BY THE GUYS THAT ARE

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.381
UNDERGROUND SO WE FEEL VERY

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:06.981
STRONGLY ABOUT WORKING ON THE

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:10.218
WORKERS BECAUSE ISSUE AND

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.086
PARTICULARLY THE FRAUD.

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:16.057
THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF MINE

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.126
IS A BILL WE HAVE --

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:19.994
IN.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:20.561
ACTUALLY IT'S STILL IN THE

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.463
SENATE I AM AFRAID THAT MEANS

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:26.134
IT'S DEAD BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP --

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.102
TAXES ARE A BIG ISSUE.

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:30.405
AND THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:32.040
CONCERN ABOUT --

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:36.077
THE REPEAL OF THE SPLIT TAX ROLL --

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.179
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.114
FOR A 10% BUSINESS TAX.

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:42.517
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.152
DISCUSSION FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.020
SALES TAX ON SERVICES.

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:48.456
AND IT GOES ON AND ON BUT I

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:52.126
THINK MY MAJOR CONCERN.

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:52.627
IS ON WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:56.164
GOVERNMENT IS DOING --

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.066
MY SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE

01:28:58.132 --> 01:29:00.034
U. S. CHAMBER --

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:00.568
SMALL BUSINESS COUNCIL.

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:04.038
THEY TELL ME THAT --

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:06.174
WHEN THE RIGS COME OUT ON TAX

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:06.407
REFORM?

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:10.044
THAT ONLY S. AND C. CORPORATIONS

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:10.712
WILL BE ALLOWED TO TAKE BUSINESS

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.080
EXPENSES.

01:29:12.146 --> 01:29:14.482
THIS WE'LL BE A DISASTER FOR

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:18.086
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ONLY 17%.

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.321
OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.090
INCORPORATED.

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:24.258
AND PART OF IT IS THAT THEY

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:24.826
DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES IN I

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:27.962
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE OTHER

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:28.396
HAND IF WE COULD.

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.364
IF YOU COULD HELP US --

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.533
AND WE THINK S. B. FOURTEEN

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.001
SEVENTEEN WOULD HELP.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:36.471
BECAUSE THE NUMBER ONE REASON

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.139
THEY DON'T INCORPORATE IS

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:38.740
BECAUSE OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:42.110
DOLLARS MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAG.

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:42.710
SO THIS WOULD MAKE A SLIDING

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:45.980
SCALE --

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:46.547
MICRO BUSINESSES WHICH ARE

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.015
IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY.

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:50.418
WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:54.088
MINIMUM. FOR TWO MINUTES FOUR

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:54.622
HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED EIGHT

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:55.223
HUNDRED SO YOU WOULD ONLY PAY

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.491
THE EIGHT HUNDRED IF YEAR GROSS

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.493
REVENUES FOR FIFTEEN MILLION OR

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:02.096
MORE -- IT'S

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.265
TYPICAL THAT IS BOGGED DOWN AND

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.000
APPROPRIATIONS --

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:06.634
I THINK YOU NEED TO EDUCATORS

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.269
HOW TO GET THINGS THROUGH

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.004
APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.140
HAVE A LOT OF CPA'S AND WE GET

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.175
BOGGED DOWN WITH THE THE

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:14.809
FINANCIAL END OF IT [INAUDIBLE]

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:18.346
BUT HERE'S A STATISTIC THAT I

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:18.946
WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND DO

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:22.150
THE ARITHMETIC.

SMALL BUSINESSES [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:38.226
OWNERS [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:40.061
UP.

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:42.063
WE NEED DEFINITION OF LOCAL.

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:46.033
DOES THAT MEAN --

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.035
THAT BE YOU KNOW IT'S THE COUNTY

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:50.171
DOESN'T MEAN THE CITY DOESN'T

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:52.073
MEAN US HOPEFULLY IT MEANS A

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:52.306
STATE.

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:56.043
BUT ONE OF OUR AND ACTUALLY IT'S

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:58.112
THE CHAIR OF OUR ORGANIZATION --

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.181
HAS A STRIPING COMPANY.

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:02.183
AND SHE BID ON BOWED.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.452
OUT OF FIVE CONTRACTS YOU CAN

CONCERNS US.

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.128
SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.030
AND REEVALUATE --

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:18.399
THE INCENTIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESS

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:21.969

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:28.209
THE OTHER AREA THAT WE ARE

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.311

ENROLLED IN SCHOOL AND THEY

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.027

SECONDLY TOTAL COMPENSATION.

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:50.031
THIS IS MORE THAN THE TIP CREDIT

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:52.166
IT INCLUDES ALL SMALL FARMERS.

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:54.235

THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:10.051
PENALIZED BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:53.995
AND THE SLAVE IN THE DOORWAY AND

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:54.628
OF THE WOMEN ARE AFRAID TO COME

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:56.030
INTO HER HAIR SALON.

01:33:56.097 --> 01:34:00.034
SO WE NEED TO WORK TO HELP THEM.

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:02.103
BUT WE NEED TO WORK TO SOLVE

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.071
THAT AND WE ARE ALL --

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:04.672
READY AND WILLING AND ABLE TO

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:06.040
WORK ON THAT.

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:10.144
SO WHAT COULD YOU DO TO HELP US.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:12.013
WELL I THINK SMALL BUSINESS AND

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:12.580
I'M GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:13.147
BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS SMALL

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.048
BUSINESS.

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:16.417
SMALL BUSINESSES TO ME HAVE

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.219
EMPLOYEES [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:18.285 --> 01:34:22.156
AND WE NEED ED --

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.158
EXPRESSION THAT PEOPLE

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:26.427
UNDERSTAND I THINK MOST OF IT IS

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.062
UNINTENTIONAL.

01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:30.164
WHEN SOMETHING NEGATIVE HAPPENS

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.233
TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.201
I DON'T THINK THE INTENT WAS TO

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:36.103
HURT THE COMMUNITY?

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:36.704
BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.539
THAT WE COULD DO TO HAVE AN

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:42.109
EXPRESSION OF GOVERNMENT GETS IT.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:44.245
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP.

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:48.082
AND GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING --

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.251
I THINK IT'S TIME TO REVISIT THE

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:54.055
FIVE FOUR DAY TEN HOUR WEEK IF

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:54.688
FOR NO OTHER REASON BECAUSE OF

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:56.123
TRANSPORTATION.

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.192
TRAFFIC AND THE FACT THAT

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:58.826
EMPLOYEES OR HAVING TO DRIVE SO

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.127
FAR.

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:02.463
IT WOULD IT BE EASIER TO DRIVE

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.398
FOUR DAYS THEN IT WOULD BE FIVE

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:08.002
DAYS -- THE

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:08.602
THING YOU ALSO WORKED ON IS

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:12.073
RIGHT TO CURE I WOULD LIKE TO

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:20.047

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:22.183
IF THEY WERE GIVEN A CHANCE TO

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:24.018
CURE IT YOU'D NEVER SEE AGAIN

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:24.652

SO WE HIRED A LOT OF STUDENTS WE

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.441

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:56.076
SCHEDULING.

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:58.178
SO THAT WHEN THEY HAVE CLASSES

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:58.812
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW TO

01:51:58.878 --> 01:51:59.412
WORK AROUND THEIR SCHEDULE AND

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:00.580
HAVING STOP THAT WE CAN FILL IN

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:04.050
THE HOLES --

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:04.717
I KNOW THERE'S A BILL OUT THERE

01:52:04.784 --> 01:52:06.486
COMES AND GOES SEEMS FOR PAST

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:08.121
YEARS FOR PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING --

01:52:08.188 --> 01:52:10.423
PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING WOULD BE

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.125
DEVASTATING TO US --

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:12.725
I OFFER A THREE WEEK SCHEDULE

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:14.094
CURRENTLY.

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.529
BUT NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN THE

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:20.066
STAFF CHANGES THE SCHEDULE --

01:52:20.133 --> 01:52:20.700
YOU KNOW THEY NEED PEOPLE TO

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.502
COVER THEIR SHIPS BECAUSE THEY

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.104
HAVE OTHER THINGS THAT COME UP.

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:25.972
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:26.506
THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY TWO

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:28.108
O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT.

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:28.775
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO BE THERE SO

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:30.110
THAT HAS RULING IMPACT.

01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:32.045
AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.280
PROVISIONS IN SOME OF THESE

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.082
PREDICTIVE SCHEDULING BILLS. TO

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:38.184
ALLOW SOMEBODY SAID TO GET THE

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:38.818
HIRE SOMEBODY AND THEN THERE'S

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:42.155
NO PENALTIES.

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:42.689
HIRE SOMEBODY FROM BRING

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:44.090
SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER SHIFT

01:52:44.157 --> 01:52:45.992
EVERYTHING NOW HOW SOMEBODY ELSE

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:46.626
THAT I HAVE TO FILL THAT SHIFT

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.027
VOCAL BACK PERSON FROM.

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:52.098
SO KIND OF ROLLS DOWNHILL --

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:52.765
SO JUST KEEP IN MIND THE PURSUIT

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.033
OF SCHEDULING FOR RESTAURANT.

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.503

IN ADDITION BIGGER RESTAURANT WE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.106

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:00.406
[INAUDIBLE]

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:04.043
AND PEOPLE DON'T PLAN AHEAD I

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.212
GOT A CALL LAST NIGHT. FOR FIFTY

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.281
PEOPLE WANT THE CATERING ON

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:10.049
SATURDAY.

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:12.118
I HAVE STAFF THAT IS GLAD TO DO

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:12.785
IT THEY WANT THE EXTRA HOURS SO

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.154
THEY CAN COME IN.

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.022
BUT UNDER THESE PREDICTIVE

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:16.656

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.193

SO THEN I HAVE TO WAYS OF WORTH

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:23.163
TAKING IS A CATERING OR NOT TAKE

01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:26.166

WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:30.670
SO YOU DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:32.138
LUNCH THAT WAS IMPLANTED OR YOU

01:53:32.205 --> 01:53:34.474

YOU OFFER DIFFERENT --

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:46.085
BUT WE CAN DO IT BOTH WILL DO IT --

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:48.221
SO PREDICT THE SCHEDULING NUMBER

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.123
ONE ON THE LIST.

01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:50.690
ARE THERE SOME UNINTENDED

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:52.225
CONSEQUENCES THAT SHOW UP

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:54.160
FREQUENTLY --

01:53:54.227 --> 01:53:56.129
SICK PAY.

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:58.164
THE BILL IS NOW SIX DAYS OUR

01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:00.033
SHIPS BY THE WAY ARE.

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:00.667
GENERALLY SIX HOURS BY THE HAVE

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:04.070
TO SIX HOURS --

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:04.704
AND SICK PAY WORKS ON A TWENTY

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:06.139
FOUR HOUR DAY.

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.374
SO INSTEAD OF GETTING.

01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:10.476
IF IT'S A THREE DAY INSTEAD OF

01:54:10.543 --> 01:54:11.177
GETTING THREE DAYS OF SICK HEADS

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:14.113
ACTUALLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WOULD

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.049
BE FIVE DAYS OF SICK PAY.

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:18.251
THEY FIVE SERVICE WHEN IT GOES

01:54:18.318 --> 01:54:22.055
TO SIX THAT'S TEN DAYS.

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:22.655
OF SICK PAY HEARING CITY ABOUT

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.090
WHY --

01:54:24.157 --> 01:54:24.624
BECAUSE THE CASE IS A NO

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:26.025
QUESTIONS ASKED POLICY THERE'S

01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:26.593
NO DOCTORS NO THERE NOTHING

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:28.094
REQUIRED TO SAY YOU WERE SAYING --

01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:30.063
BECAUSE WE HAVE STUDENTS.

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:32.398
SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE SUMMER

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:34.267
FRIDAY NIGHTS IN THE SUMMER

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:36.069
STUDENTS MAKE OTHER PLANS.

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:38.071
SO THEY CALL IN SICK.

01:54:38.137 --> 01:54:42.075
AND THEY DON'T GIVE YOU NOTICE.

01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:44.077
YOU KNOW WE ASK.

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:46.379
BUT THEY FEAR THAT IF WE GIVE US

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:47.013
NOTICE THEM IS NOT CONSIDERED A

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.081
SICK DAY.

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:50.516
SO LOW COST THAT AFTERNOON EXACT

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:52.385
INCOME AND OR THOUGH BECAUSE OF

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:54.287
THE START OF THEIR SHIFT AND SAY

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:54.821
HEY I NEED TO SIT BACK --

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:58.091
GOING TO CONCERTS.

01:54:58.157 --> 01:55:00.159
YOU KNOW AND SO WE HAVE THIS

01:55:00.226 --> 01:55:00.693
TIME BECAUSE THEY GET PAID

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.095
ANYWAY.

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:04.297
THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:04.931
SHOW UP ON THOSE WEEKENDS DURING

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:05.398
THE SUMMER [INAUDIBLE]

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:06.099
REALLY.

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:08.134
A REAL ISSUE --

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:10.236
AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE BUT I FEEL

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:12.071
I KNOW MANY RESTAURANTS ARE

01:55:12.138 --> 01:55:12.338
FEELING.

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:14.173
AROUND THIS FACILITY --

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.309
SAID SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND I

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:18.011
I WAS AT THE HEARINGS PERCENT

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:18.678
PAY I KNOW THE ISSUES THAT COME

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.513
UP WITH FAMILIES OF SUPPORT.

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.047
YOU KNOW TRYING TO BE AS

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:22.448
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN WE

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:24.217
DO A BLANKET [INAUDIBLE]

01:55:24.284 --> 01:55:26.052
LAW.

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:28.254
THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:30.223
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SITUATION.

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.125
AT ALL IT'S NO QUESTIONS ASKED

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:34.027
ITS WHATEVER YOU CAN GET AROUND

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:34.327
TO CALLING.

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:36.162
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL IT THE

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:38.064
DAY AFTER THE START OF HER SHIFT.

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:38.564
ANY OF THOSE FACTORS.

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:40.066
TOTALLY.

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:42.335
I'M FINE UNDER THE OCCURRENCE OF

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:46.139
PEBBLES --

01:55:46.205 --> 01:55:48.241
IN ADDITION [INAUDIBLE]

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:52.111
THE THE WAGE INCREASES --

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:56.082
ARE BIG UNKNOWN FOR US.

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:58.084
THERE WERE RESTAURANTS.

01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:00.320
THE STAFF GETS TAPPED OUT OF A

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:00.953
CERTAIN UPS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.324
FULL SERVICE WHICH GOING FROM WE

01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:06.359
JUST WANT TO TWELVE DOLLARS

01:56:06.426 --> 01:56:08.094
RAISE PRICES.

01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:10.163
WE GOT A FIFTEEN DOLLARS UNITS

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:12.165
ANOTHER BIG INCREASED FROM

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:14.200
THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTEEN

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:14.801
AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE TIED TO

01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:16.102
INFLATION.

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:16.703
WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:18.104
WAGE INCREASES EVERY YEAR.

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:20.073
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE RAISE

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:20.707
WAGES BUSINESSES HAVE TO RAISE

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:24.110
PRICES.

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.112
SO WE'VE CREATED A SPIRAL.

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:26.312
THAT.

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:26.946
IS GONNA MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:28.381
US TO STABILIZE WAGES IN

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:30.016
PREDICTING THE FUTURE.

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:32.318
WHAT OUR WAGES ARE SO WHAT A

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:32.919
RESTAURANTS DOING WHAT WE CALL

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:36.022
CUTS DOWN?

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:36.622
I HAD SIXTEEN PEOPLE WHEN I

01:56:36.689 --> 01:56:38.157
OPENED.

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:38.725
WHICH IS WHEN EVERYONE TO

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.159
FOURTEEN AND I DON'T.

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:40.760
TWELVE AND FOR AWHILE WE WERE

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:42.095
ATTACKED --

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:44.063
ONCE.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.399
EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO SCHOOL

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:46.999
WILL BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:50.103
AND TWELVE PEOPLE --

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:50.737
FROM WHAT I'M SEEING IN OTHER

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:52.438
CITIES THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.173
ACROSS RAIMES.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.075
WE'VE GOT TO STOP.

01:56:56.142 --> 01:56:58.311
SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW OR WE

01:56:58.378 --> 01:57:00.079
CUT THE HOURS.

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:00.713
THAT THE STAFF IS WORKING FINE

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.482
FROM SEVEN HOUR SHIFTS TO SIX

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:06.052
HOURS OF SURVIVORSHIP --

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:06.753
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT KEEP IN

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:08.388
MIND REFUSE UNINTENDED

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:10.123
CONSEQUENCES ARE BECAUSE WE

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.757
STILL HAVE TO MEET THAT BOTTOM

01:57:10.823 --> 01:57:12.525
LINE IS NOT THAT WE WANT TO GET

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.093
FROM LOS.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:16.095
STOCK TO MEET THE BOTTOM.

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:16.662
ONE IT IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:17.296
MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY FOR

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:18.097
YOUR MEAL.

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:18.698
YOU KNOW THERE'S A POINT THAT

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:20.099
WE'RE GONNA BE PRICING.

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:23.970
CUSTOMERS OUT OF THE RESTAURANT --

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:24.637
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COVER SO MUCH

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.105
IN WAGES.

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:28.374
AS I JUST WAGES ITS WORKERS COMP

01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:30.076
AND IT'S WITH TAXES ON WHICH

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:34.046
BRINGS ME MY NEXT POINT --

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:34.647
AND BETTY WAS KIND ENOUGH TO

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:36.115
BRING IT UP.

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:38.317
WE DON'T HAVE A TOTAL

01:57:38.384 --> 01:57:38.918
COMPENSATION PLAN HERE IN THE

01:57:38.985 --> 01:57:40.119
STATE.

01:57:40.186 --> 01:57:42.355
I KNOW THE RESTAURANT

01:57:42.422 --> 01:57:44.157
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN ADVOCATING --

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:46.392
FOR ONE BUT ONE OF THE FIRST

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:50.129
STEPS I THINK IS.

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:52.031
WHEN A CUSTOMER LEAVES THE TEST?

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:52.632
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS AT THE

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:54.033
RESTAURANT.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:58.137
I HAVE TO PAY TAX.

01:57:58.204 --> 01:57:58.604
ON A PORTION OF THAT.

01:57:58.671 --> 01:58:00.306
TO THE EMPLOYER PAYS TAX ON IT

01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:02.375
UP AS WELL WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:02.975
WITH THEIR INCOME [INAUDIBLE]

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:06.345
BUT I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:08.047
ISSUE THAT.

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:10.216
THE TIP IS COUNTED AS WAGES WHEN

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:12.051
I HAVE TO PAY TAXES OF THE STATE.

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:14.253
AND WORKERS COMP BECAUSE IT'S

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.055
ABOUT BASIS WELL.

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:16.622
BUT IS NOT COUNTED AS WAGES

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:20.059
TOWARDS MINIMUM WAGE.

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:20.660
SO SOMETIMES IT'S CONSIDERED A

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:22.361
WAGE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:22.995
CONSIDERED A WAGE AND IT SEEMS

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:26.065
TO BE WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT.

01:58:26.132 --> 01:58:26.666
TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.167
BUSINESS HAS TO PAY.

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:30.102
SO MY FIRST TASK.

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:32.371
IS PERHAPS WE CAN WAIVE THE

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:34.106
EMPLOYER PORTION.

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:40.112
OF THE TAX ON TIPS.

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:44.116
IT DOES SEEM FAIR ABOUT.

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:46.118
LIKE ABOUT 1212%.

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:48.020
ON EVERY DOLLAR.

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:50.122
THAT EMPLOYEE MAKES ATTEMPTS.

01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:54.093
WHICH I CAN STEP --

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:58.130
THE LAST THING.

01:58:58.197 --> 01:59:00.399
AND AGAIN I I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:01.033
READY ENOUGH THAT HER RIGHT TO

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.134
TERRACE STATEMENTS.

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:04.036
YOU KNOW.

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:04.637
THE THE CALIFORNIA'S THIS IS

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.038
VERY COMPLICATED.

01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:08.541
AND GIVING THEM A BUSINESS OWNER

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:10.409
THE RIGHT TO CARE ONE ERROR

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:10.710
SERVERS ARE.

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:11.010
FAMOUSLY --

01:59:11.077 --> 01:59:14.046
IS.

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:14.647
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:16.148
THINK 90% OF THE TIME DEFINED

01:59:16.215 --> 01:59:18.184
BUSINESS DO IT IF THEY DON'T DO

01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:18.351
IT.

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:20.086
BENNY COME DOWN HARD ON A THE

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:22.054
NEW.

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:22.555

TAXATION WEBSITE.

01:59:24.123 --> 01:59:26.058
IS VERY CONFUSING.

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:28.494
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:29.028
OLD BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:30.062
WEBSITE.

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:32.365
AND I'D HOPE THAT SOMEBODY TAKES

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:32.999
A LOOK AT IT AND SIMPLIFIES A

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:34.066
FOR BUSINESS OWNERS.

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.402

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:36.869
THE TAXES [INAUDIBLE]

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:40.039
IT'S DIFFICULT --

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:40.640
AND IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:41.207
TAKING LONGER TO PROCESS THE

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:42.241

01:59:42.308 --> 01:59:48.047
AS WELL --

01:59:48.114 --> 01:59:48.214

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:48.848
I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:52.051
GOING ON THERE --

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:52.718
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY

01:59:52.785 --> 01:59:54.420
BE UP THE OTHER PART THAT WE'RE

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.088
FACING WHICH I WILL BRING UP.

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:58.090
IS I HAS A RESTAURANT WE ARE NOW

01:59:58.157 --> 01:59:58.624

01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:01.994
DELIVERY SO.

TWENTY FOUR NINA GLOBAL TRYING

02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:08.167
USE THEM ALL --

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:08.801
THEY'LL TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF OUR

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:10.136
SALES.

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:12.305
COMMISSION WHICH WE HAPPILY PAY

02:00:12.371 --> 02:00:12.905
BECAUSE THEY COVER THE COST OF

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:16.142
THE DELIVERY.

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:16.809
CURRENTLY THEY COLLECT THE SALES

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:18.044
TAX.

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:20.046
ON THE SALE.

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:22.048
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SOLD.

02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:22.648

TO THE RESTAURANT.

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:28.421
AND THEN WE HAVE TO PAY SALES

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:30.289
TAX ON WHAT THEY SENT TO US OFF

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:32.592

BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN A COMMISSION

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:38.064
OFF OF THAT.

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:38.598
IT'S BECOMING MORE MORE

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:40.399
COMPLICATED TO TRAFFIC AS WE ALL

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:42.068

EASIER FOR THE RESTAURANTS HAVE

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:14.100

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:22.341
ARE PARTICULAR TO RESTAURANTS

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:24.010

PROPERTY BASE WHICH IS

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:56.428
UNFORTUNATE BUT THE VERY SMALL

THE BUSINESSES HATE THAT THIS.

S. BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER TAX.

02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:04.269
