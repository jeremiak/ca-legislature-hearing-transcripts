THIS IN TURN HAS THE POTENTIAL

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:23.463
TO CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.132
THAT CAN BE INVESTED BECAUSE WE

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.500

IT'S GONNA BE. THERE THE FULL

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:55.208
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE

01:46:55.275 --> 01:46:57.144
ALL LOOKING AT AND CALLING THAT

HERE AT WITH. THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:18.632
WERE WERE GRAPPLING WITH- BUT

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.100
WE'RE ALL GRAPPLING WITH THAT.

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.501
W. E. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:22.836
YOU'RE THE FLOOD OR THE DAM BUT

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:24.371
YEAR WHERE THINGS GET BACKED UP

01:47:24.437 --> 01:47:25.605
WHEN WE DON'T DO ALL OF OUR

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:28.842
WORK ON THE FRONT END OUT IN

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:31.044
THE COMMUNITY- SO I GUESS AND-

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:33.046
I GUESS I. BUT WE UNDERSTAND

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.314
YOUR YOUR DESIRE AND YOUR

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.349
RESPONSIBILITY. TO SERVICE

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.651
POPULATION AND DO SOMETHING

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:39.753
ABOUT IT WITH THE HUGE BACKLOG.

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.620
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:42.088
LOT OF OTHER PROPOSALS THAT THE

01:47:42.155 --> 01:47:43.056
ADMINISTRATION HAS ON THE

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.958
TABLE. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:48.628
OF THE SAME ISSUES. I'M THE ONE

01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:49.229
RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO THE L.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:53.500
A. O. OR- OR NOT AT THIS TIME.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.035
EITHER ENOUGH EITHER FOR THAT

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:55.602
THE DIRECTOR OF THE FOR THE

01:47:55.669 --> 01:48:00.240
DEPUTY. I'LL START AND THEN.

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:02.108
PASS IT OVER TO PRESS IF SHE

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.944
HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:05.478
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:07.314
WOULD JUST NOTE IN THE-

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:08.615
RECOMMENDATION TO INVEST

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:11.718
FURTHER IN THE STRATEGIES- AND

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:13.119
WE DO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:15.555
STRATEGY. ALL OF THE STRATEGIES

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:19.526
AROUND- I. S. TEASE AND IT WE

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:22.596
DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ON

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:26.733
DIVERSION AS WELL AS FOR- A

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.202
COMMUNITY BASED ON GBC T. IS

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:30.503
THAT WE WHAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:31.938
FINDING IN OUR CONVERSATIONS

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:32.973
WITH THE COUNTY IS THAT THOSE

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:35.041
THAT HAVE. BUILT SOME OF THIS

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.009
CONTINUUM ALREADY AND I'VE

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:37.444
ALREADY BEEN OUR PARTNERS ARE

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.612
ARE PROBABLY THE ONES THAT ARE

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:40.280
GOING TO BE BEST SUITED FOR

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.648
MOVING INTO TAKING OVER

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:47.320
RESPONSIBILITY THEY. HAVE

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:47.921
EXPERIENCE READING THEM AND-

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:50.190
BUT FAR AS JUST. TWENTY IN THE

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.825
THESE STRATEGIES- WHAT WE HAVE

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:54.160
NOW IS. WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE

01:48:54.227 --> 01:48:55.562
COMMITTEES ARE BUDGET

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.464
COMMITTEES AND YEAR AFTER YEAR

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.698
AFTER YEAR ASKING FOR IN

01:48:58.765 --> 01:49:00.267
COMPANIES AND PROPERTY AND

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:01.735
BUILDING CAPACITY TO SERVE IT

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.803
WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. I'M EIGHT

01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:05.605
THROUGH THESE PARTNERSHIPS. BUT

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:07.741
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE

01:49:07.807 --> 01:49:10.343
RATES OF REFERRALS CONTINUE. TO

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:15.215
INCREASE- YEAH THIS YEAR IS AS-

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.751
INCREASES MARGINALLY MOSTLY AND

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.753
SAY IT'S ALL COKE RIGHT. BUT IN

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:21.021
THE PRIOR YEARS AS WE DEVELOP

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.689
OUR CAPACITY WE SIGN THE

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:24.557
NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:27.093
AND SO I AM MOVING THAT'S THE

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.429
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTY.

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.398
WHAT THAT DOES IS GIVES ME

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.266
COUNTY BACK MY FULL CONTROL THE

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:35.035
THAT THE UNDERSTANDING THE

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:36.703
ABILITY TO THE KIND OF ALL THE

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.338
PARTNERS WORKING TOGETHER TO

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:40.740
BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHERE THE

01:49:40.807 --> 01:49:42.409
CHALLENGES ARE IN THE IN IN

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:44.077
THEIR THEIR CONTINUUM OF CARE

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.313
EONS- WHAT INVESTMENT

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.614
STRATEGIES THEY NEED TO DO TO

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:51.184
TARGET THIS POPULATION- WHAT WE

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.520
FOUND IS THAT. YOU REALLY WHAT

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:55.622
WE SEE IS THAT OFTEN THE

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:57.424
ABILITY TO PUT SOMEBODY OUT OF

01:49:57.490 --> 01:49:58.658
STATE HOSPITAL IS THE

01:49:58.725 --> 01:50:00.493
OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT. AND

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.195
IN MANY CASES AND SO WE REALLY

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:05.432
WANT TO TRY TO AS DRESSED IN

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:07.701
THIS MYSTERY POPULATION THAT WE

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:08.969
AS THE DEPARTMENT APPLE

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:10.804
RESPONSIBILITY THE STATE OWNS

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.272
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYBODY

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.274
WHO'S FOUND ANTHONY HOPKINS FAN

01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:17.744
FROM. IS TO MOVE INTO AS THAT

BETTER COUNTY SYSTEM SET UP

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:51.918
WOULD HAVE FEWER PEOPLE BEING

REFERRED TO THIS FIFTEEN TIMES

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.755

MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:49.175
ADDRESS THAT. AND THEN JUST THE

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:50.543
EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BETTER

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:52.045
ADDRESS THE ESCALATING OF

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:54.814
FELONY I ISSUE WEIGHTLESS. SO

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:58.785
WE HAVE PROPOSED THIS COMMUNITY

01:55:58.851 --> 01:55:59.319
CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.887
PROGRAM. OKAY WELL A LOT MORE

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:01.487
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE STARTED

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:03.890
PANICKING TO TIME. THANK YOU I

01:56:03.956 --> 01:56:05.191
THINK SILICON ESTIMATE FIRST OF

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:07.193
ALL TWO ITEMS AGO ALSO APPLY TO

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:07.794
THIS ONE BUT LET ME JUST ASK A

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:10.029
QUESTION THEN WE- WE ACTUALLY

01:56:10.096 --> 01:56:11.497
HAD TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET

01:56:11.564 --> 01:56:12.799
ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE HUNDRED

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.434
MILLION THERE SEVERAL COUNTIES

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.769
RIGHT THAT ARE GETTING FUNDING.

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:20.106
CORRECT NINETY ONE. IN- SO- I

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.274
JUST DID THAT MAKE THE CORE

01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:23.910
ISSUE IS THE- I. S. T. BACKLOG.

01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:27.080
SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:30.149
THIS FUNDING. WHAT IS. THE

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:31.584
OUTCOME WE'RE EXPECTING HOMES

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:34.420
WHAT REDUCTION AN ICY BACKLOG

01:56:34.487 --> 01:56:34.921
SHOULD WE EXPECT AS THE

01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:37.023
LEGISLATURE- FROM THE USE OF

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.825
THIS FUNDING AND IF YOU DON'T

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:40.460
ACHIEVE THAT AND I HOPE YOU

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:41.394
WOULD AGREE THEN WE SHOULD STOP

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:43.563
THE PROGRAM. SO WHAT IS THE

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:44.764
OUTCOME MEASURE IN WHICH WE

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:48.101
NEED TO CHIEF JUSTICE DECLARED

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:48.634
THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS OR

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:52.171
FAILURE. SO THE FUNDING LEVEL

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.806
THAT'S PROPOSED AND I'M NOT

01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:54.807
TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDING LEVEL

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:56.142
I WON AND NUMBER FOR WHAT DE

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:57.710
ICED TEA BACKLOG SHOULD BE SO

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:58.778
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TWO

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:01.948
YEARS NEXT YEAR WE SAY. THIS

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:04.150
PROGRAM WORKED OR DIDN'T WORK.

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:07.420
SO OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO-

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:09.889
THEY MET INDIVIDUALS WITH AND-

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:11.958
AT LEAST GET DOWN TO SIX FEET

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:14.127
UNDER SIXTY DAYS I WHICH IS

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:15.628
CURRENTLY THE REQUIREMENTS

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:19.832
UNDER. THAT COURT DECISION BUT

01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:21.868
ULTIMATELY THE SOONER THAT WE

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.336
CAN GET AND THE VISUALS INTO

01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:25.071
TREATMENT FOR I. S. T. THAT'S

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:26.973
OUR ULTIMATE CALL BUT- THE

01:57:27.039 --> 01:57:28.841
SUCCESS WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:32.078
IS LOOKING TO GET OUR IT IS OUR

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:34.714
MISSION TIMELINES FOR ALL OF

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:38.651
THAT POPULATION. UNDER THE AGE.

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:39.285
SO THAT WOULD CAUSE WHAT WOULD

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:40.620
THAT DO TO THE BACKLOG IF WE

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:44.056
DID THAT. SO THE NOT REALLY

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:45.191
DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ADMISSION

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:47.160
RATES ARE RIGHT SO IF YOU CAN

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:49.061
SET ARE AND AS WE BRING ON

CAPACITY OUR ADMISSION RATE

01:57:50.363 --> 01:57:52.632
INCREASE. SO THAT NUMBER IS

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:54.801
ALWAYS CANDIDATES ENGINES ARE

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.835
REALLY HAD A LOOK AT WHAT

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:57.203
THEY'VE ALREADY MONTHS WORTH OF

01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:01.974
EMISSIONS ARE YOU KNOW RATE IS.

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:04.510
ORDERED KNOW THAT YOUR AND YOUR

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:07.146
WEIGHT LIST IS WITHIN THAT OKAY.

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:09.182
I'M NOT NUMBER GONNA ALL KIND

01:58:09.248 --> 01:58:10.583
OF MOVED AND ON THE LOWER

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:13.152
CAPACITY YEAH OKAY RIGHT SO.

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:14.353
WELL THERE'S WELL LET'S SITE

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.221
THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM IF

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.323

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:18.758
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:20.460
GO AND RIGHT SO I REALIZE THAT.

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:23.529
YOUR OVERALL WAITLIST HìNH.

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:24.764
THE TIME ZONE MISSION IS

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:26.132
SOMEWHAT IS OBVIOUSLY MAY

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.700
FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON THE

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:28.234
CAPACITY HAVE WITHIN THE

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:30.570
HOSPITAL. BUT AT LEAST WHAT A

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:33.206
UNDERSTAND UNLESS I HEARD WRONG

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:34.307
THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING IS

01:58:34.373 --> 01:58:35.408
ACTUALLY TO PREVENT PEOPE FROM

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:36.809
EVEN HAVING TO GO THERE TO YOU

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:40.780
TAKE CARE. OF IT AT THE COUNTY

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:41.714
LEVEL CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY ARE

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:44.784
SO. WHEN THINGS AND- THAT I

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:45.718
THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:46.919
IMPORTANT AND I AGAIN

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.321
APPRECIATE WHAT ELIA SAID AND

01:58:48.387 --> 01:58:49.889
THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM I THINK

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:50.723
FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THIS

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.592
PROPOSAL. WHEN I HEARD IT BACK

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.694
IN- IN THAT PRIOR BUDGET YEAR

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.696
IS THAT WE NEED MUCH CLEAR

01:58:56.762 --> 01:59:00.032
METRICS. AS TO WHAT. GIVEN

01:59:00.099 --> 01:59:01.300
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.502
WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR THIS

01:59:02.568 --> 01:59:04.537
MONEY. SO I REALIZE THERE MAY

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:05.771
BE DIFFERENT APPROACHES PEOPLE

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.306
MAY TAKE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:08.608
AND SO FORTH GIVEN WHAT THE

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:09.642
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BUT

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:11.777
ULTIMATELY. WHAT IS GOING TO

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:14.380
CHANGE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SO

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:15.414
I REALIZE THAT YOU SAID YOU

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:17.016
WANT TO REDUCE YOUR- YOU KNOW

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.951
THE TIME- TO THE SIXTY DAYS

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:19.819
THAT'S CERTAINLY VERY

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:22.088
IMPORTANT- BUT SINCE IS A

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.589
PREVENTION PROGRAM I MEAN

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.557
HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT KEEPING

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:25.825
THAT BECAUSE WE CHANGED A

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:27.527
PASSING HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEN

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:28.160
THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD PUT THE

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:29.962
MONEY INTO THAT AND- WE'RE

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:32.131
TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND THIS THIS

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:33.466
FUNDING IS TO TRY TO PREVENT

01:59:33.533 --> 01:59:34.600
PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO GO IN AND

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:36.903
SO. ASIDE FROM THE FLUCTUATIONS

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:38.704
IT MAY HAPPEN TO YOUR CAPACITY.

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:40.640
WHAT MEASURES DO WE HAVE THAT

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.909
ACTUALLY WILL. SHOW THAT WE'VE

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:43.943
ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.645
PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEING REFERRED.

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:49.315
INTO. IN THE INTERVENTION

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:51.651
COUNTIES CORRECT. SO IT GETS

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:53.185
MONEY JUST MAKE SURE. TO

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.987
CLARIFY THAT THAT THAT THE

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:56.289
INDIVIDUALS MAY STILL BE BURKE.

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:58.057
AN INCUMBENT IS DOWN FINAL BUT

01:59:58.124 --> 01:59:59.959
WILL BE TREATED IN THE COUNCIL

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:02.128
SO- THERE IS A THERE MAYSTILL

02:00:02.194 --> 02:00:04.497
BE THIS IS THE FINDINGS. BUT

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:06.666
THEY WILL BE AT IT ANY

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.734
PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WILL BE

02:00:08.801 --> 02:00:10.469
TREATED IN THE COUNTY UNLESS

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:11.604
THEY REFER INDIVIDUALS TO US

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.372
AND IN IN THIS PROPOSAL WE

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:14.840
ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT.

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:16.309
OF THE ICE TEAS WILL STILL

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:17.944

THAT THIS WILL IN THE NEXT

02:00:37.997 --> 02:00:41.133
FISCAL YEAR- THAT COULD REDUCE

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.435
OUR WAITLIST DOWN TO A TIME

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.370
WHERE WE ARE. NEEDING THIS

SIXTY DAYS BUT IT'S ALL REALLY

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:47.640
DEPENDING UPON HOW MANY COUNTY

OPPOSE ALL IS A BRAND NEW

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:36.922
PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE DO NOT

THAT'S JUST A SMALL SUBSET IT

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:02.148
WAS ONLY AND- DESIGNED THE

02:02:02.214 --> 02:02:03.249
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:32.712
MORE TIME TO DO. AT THE INTO IT

02:02:32.778 --> 02:02:35.147

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:36.048
LACK OF CRITICAL. IN TERMS OF

LINE OF QUESTIONING MAKES MAKES

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.139
TOTAL SENSE AND THAT THERE

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:00.940
THERE SHOULD BE SORT OF MORE

02:03:01.006 --> 02:03:02.341

THE COMPOSED THE PROPOSAL. OUR

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.996
ISSUE WITH THE PROPOSAL IS- NOT

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.431
SORT OF WITH THE CONCEPT OF

02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:26.699
MAKING COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:29.001
IT- FOR THIS FOR THIS TREATMENT

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:31.237
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE

02:03:31.303 --> 02:03:32.872
AND DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM AND-

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:34.673
ITS SORT OF THE SET UP IN A WAY

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:35.241
THAT. MAKES WHETHER OR NOT

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.675
THESE THE SORT OF LIKE FRONT

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:39.011
END INVESTMENTS ARE- YOU KNOW

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:42.548
SUBJECT UNCERTAINTY IN AND- AB.

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:43.449
MAKES IT SO THAT YOU KNOW THE

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:47.987
INCENTIVES WHICH COUNTIES WILL

02:03:48.053 --> 02:03:49.121
OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL FIRST OF

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:50.456
ALL I THINK HAVING SOME CLEAR

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:52.057
OUTCOMES FOR WHATEVER THE

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.092
PROGRAM'S GOING TO BE IS GONNA

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.894
BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.095
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARITY

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:58.864
AS TO- ALSO HOW THIS.

02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:00.833
INTEGRATES BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:02.067
WE'RE JUST GONNA SILO ICE WHEN

02:04:02.134 --> 02:04:03.636
A FRAGMENT ALL THESE DIFFERENT

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:04.503
WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:05.905
PROPOSALS THAT MAY BE

02:04:05.971 --> 02:04:08.207
OVERLAPPING AND SO FORTH- WITH

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:09.441
SOME OF THE EXISTING ONES THAT

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:10.409
AGAIN WE'VE REALLY HEARD ABOUT

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.444
FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. SO I

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:13.913
HOPE THAT WE CAN GET MUCH MORE

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:15.681
CLARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT.

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:17.550
WE'RE DOING HERE I THINK THAT

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:18.384
IS CERTAINLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.852
TO ACHIEVE IS NOT SOMETHING WE

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.787
DISAGREE WITH. US AT LEAST I'D

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:23.656
DISAGREE I WANT USE WE- DON'T

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:25.424
SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT- I

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.259
DO I DO. THINK THAT THERE'S

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:30.095
SOME LACK OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT

02:04:30.162 --> 02:04:33.599
THE- GOALS ARE. AND OF HOW DO

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.034
WE MEASURE WHETHER. THIS

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.268
PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:38.037
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. SO HAVING

02:04:38.103 --> 02:04:39.638
CLARITY ON THAT AND THEN HAVING

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:41.006
SOME MORE CLARITY ON HOW THIS

02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:42.608
THEN WILL INTERFACE WITH ALL

02:04:42.675 --> 02:04:43.809
THE OTHER PROGRAM SO WE'RE NOT

02:04:43.876 --> 02:04:45.411
DOING DUPLICATION OR

02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:48.247
FRAGMENTATION. AS WELL AND YOU

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.515
KNOW WE HAVE BOTH THE DIVERSION

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:50.916
PROGRAM WHICH IS WITHIN THIS

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:51.750
PARTICULAR YOUR DEPARTMENT'S

02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:53.085
PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE COUNTY

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.386

AS WELL. YOU KNOW AND EACH OF

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:58.624
US AS SO FORTH SO. I THINK THAT

02:04:58.691 --> 02:05:00.392
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- TO BE

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:02.294
ABLE TO CLARIFY. BEFORE

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:05.231
PROVING- SOMETHING THAT'S- AT

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:07.666
THIS POINT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:09.702
TWO HUNDRED AND- THIRTY THREE

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.503
MILLION. DOLLARS OR- TWO

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:12.071
HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:14.039
DOLLARS SO- SO. IF WE CAN GET

02:05:14.106 --> 02:05:17.843
THAT. CLARIFIED THAT WOULD BE

02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:20.012
VERY HELPFUL. SO THE WAY I

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:22.648
UNDERSTAND IT. THE MORE WITH

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.984

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.986
SMALLER SUBSET IS TRYING TO

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:30.256

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.494
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.796
THAT'S THE OTHER SUBSET. WE'RE

CRASH AGAIN WHICH IS CERTAINLY

02:09:46.778 --> 02:09:50.182
VERY IMPORTANT BUT THAT SOUNDS

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:52.551
DIFFERENT AND- I'M NOT SURE HOW

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:53.285
TO HELP WITH THE SIXTY DAYS

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:55.754
BUT- BUT IT'S AGAIN I THINK IS

02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:56.655
A WORTHY GOAL IN ITSELF SO I

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:59.324
THINKS. TO SOME CLARITY ABOUT

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:02.294
WHAT WE'RE- FOCUSING ON IT AND

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:03.629

DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL SO-

02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:10.202
IF THERE'S SOMETHING NEEDS TO

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:11.670
BE DONE THAT FIGHT AGAINST. I

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:14.106
STILL SENT SOME I GUESS

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:16.208
CONFUSION NOT NOT WORTHINESS

02:10:16.275 --> 02:10:18.343

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.981

THE SYSTEM SPENDING ANOTHER

02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:31.689
FIFTY MILLION WHAT STEPS ARE

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:33.323
BEING TAKEN SO WHAT IS THE

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:34.825
EXPECTED LIFETIME OF THIS NEW
