ABOUT AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS- AND CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT. IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR PORTS AND SHIPPING CRISIS IS DISRUPTING THE SUPPLY CHAIN ACROSS NUMEROUS INDUSTRIES. NOW FOR OVER A YEAR- ARE STATES PORTS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED WITH UNLOADING OSINBAJO NECKS WORKER AND TRUCKER SHORTAGES. AND A LACK OF EQUIPMENT. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT- HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE BACKLOGS IN THESE CONGESTIONS COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. INCREASES IN ONLINE SHOPPING. LABOR ISSUES AND SOME DISAGREEMENTS AND CERTAINLY MORE AT THROUGHOUT PORT OFFICIALS STATE AND- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THEY HAVE MADE SOME TREMENDOUS EFFORTS TO REDUCE OUR THESE BACKLOGS AND THESE CONGESTIONS. A STATE POLICYMAKERS WE NEED TO CERTAINLY- UNDERSTAND AND BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO AVOID A RECURRENCE OF THESE ISSUES. AS WELL AS THE SHORT AND LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES THAT POOR CONGESTION HAS HAS AND WILL HAVE ON ON- OUR STATE'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA AG INDUSTRY IS A GLOBAL LEADER THAT TOTALED FORTY NINE POINT ONE SOME BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN AG EXPORTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN CURRENT- CONGESTION CRISIS HAS HAD A CRIPPLING EFFECT ON OUR STATE'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. AS FARMERS HAVE AND CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSS EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES. NEW RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR PORT AND SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION. COST CALIFORNIA FARMERS APPROX ME TWO POINT ONE BILLION. IN AG EXPORTS. A. LOSS MORE COSTLY THAN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN US CHINA TRADE WAR. ULTIMATELY THIS DAMAGES OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND PARTICULARLY OUR SMALL FAMILY OWNED FARMS AS WELL AS OUR REPUTATION ABROAD. IF WE DO NOT TAKE PRO ACTIVE MEASURES. THAT TO STOP THIS FINANCIAL BLEEDING CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE COST OF HIS ONGOING PORT CONGESTION. AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A WORLDWIDE LEADER AND THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND INDUSTRY THAT WORKS- TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLES ACROSS THE GLOBE AND ULTIMATELY MAINTAIN THE WORLD FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. AS POLICYMAKERS WE MUST LOOK AT WHAT ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. TO ENSURE FARMERS HAVE THE RESOURCES JUST TO SURVIVE THIS ECONOMIC CHALLENGE AND KEEP CALIFORNIA AS THE WORLD AGRICULTURAL LEADER I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING TODAY AND WOULD LIKE. TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DONALD TO MAKE SOME REMARKS I THANK YOU. FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE JOINT HEARING ON AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS AND CALIFORNIA ISSUES. APPEAR SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE PORCH AND GOODS MOVEMENT- THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. NOT ANSWER AGUIAR-CURRY SOME OF THE BOND WOMAN- OVERWHELMINGLY AGRICULTURAL. HAVING DISTRICTS QUITE FRANKLY. ALL THE MORE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THAT AND OR- BUT- THIS ISSUE HAS TO BE CREATED AND CERTAINLY WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY. THE DISTRIBUIDORA LOVED EACH OTHER LOOKING FOR COMPLEX NOT TOO LONG AGO. IN NOVEMBER THE SELECT COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON THE POOL GOODS MOVEMENT CRISIS AND ITS IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN THE IMPACT FOR MANY. IMPACTS WERE NOT JUST ON IMPORTS BUT THEY WERE ALSO ONE EXPLORE. NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. WE ARE. STATE AND IT IS PROBABLY. THE GROW WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO CONGESTION AT OUR PORTS AND KEEP GOODS MOVING. TODAY'S HEARING WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ONE COMPONENT OF OUR GOODS MOVEMENT SYSTEM AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS KITA CALIFORNIA WHERE THE BREAD BASKET. OF THE NATION. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE EXPORTS HAVE GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST DECADE- THE VOLUME WAS HEAVY WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY PROBABLY IS PHILOSOPHY. GETTING THAT STUFF OUT TO WHERE IT IS TO LAND CONSUMERS LOOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NAME KNOWING THEY CAN EXPECT GREAT QUALITY FROM OUR PRODUCTS CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY. TO EXPORT GOODS THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF PORTS IN THE CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE ELEVEN PORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN VARYING SIZES. I REPRESENT THE TWO LARGEST THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND THE PORT OF LONG BEACH TOGETHER THOSE SPORTS CHANNEL ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. OF CONTAINERIZED KARKAR GO ENTERING THE COUNTRY IN ABOUT 3830% OF CONTAINERIZED EXPORTS. WHEN OUR PORTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ARE WORKING AS INTENDED THEY OFTEN GO UNNOTICED. BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE NOTICING FOR A VARIETY REASON AGAIN NOT JUST ON IMPORTS BUT ALSO ON EXPORTS. YEAH WE ARE IN A MAY A MIST OF A MAJOR DISRUPTION OF THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN OUR PORT LEADERS ARE RESPONDING TO THAT CRISIS THEY DID NOT CREATE THAT CRISIS I WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT BUT THEY ARE RESPONDING- TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY TO. THAT CRISIS. THERE'S A SHARP INCREASE IN CARGO VOLUMES. IT IS CREATED SIGNIFICANT JET SIGNIFICANT CONGESTION WITH MORE SHIPS SITTING OUT THERE- BASICALLY FLOATING WAREHOUSES SUPPORT DR FOR THE WAREHOUSES ARE FULL. THERE'S SOME SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS AND SOME LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. TO THOSE ISSUES AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT. AB AS DEMAND FOR CONTAINER SPIKE AGRICULTURE EXPORTERS FACED INCREASED DIFFICULTY FINDING CONTAINERS OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT WAS THE- MOTHER DIFFICULTY WAS ASSOCIATED NOT FIGHTING CONTAINER AND EVEN THEN IF YOU HAD A CONTAINER YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHASSIS TO PUT THAT CONTAINER SO THEY AREN'T ALWAYS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUES IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE SPACE AT THE DOCK IT MIGHT BE YOU CAN'T GET A CONTAINER FOR YOU CAN'T GET. HSE TO MOVE THAT CONTAINER. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS MADE IN THE FEW MONTHS LAST FEW MONTHS I WANT TO COMMEND- GENE SOROKA. AND MARIO CORDERO FROM MY DISTRICT THAT'S PART OF LONG BEACH DIRECTOR IN PORT OF LA DIRECTOR- IT. THOUGH THOSE GENTLEMEN AND THEIR TEAMS HAVE BEEN WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY TO RESPOND. TO THE CRISIS OUR ROLE TODAY IS TO LISTEN. LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE WHAT WE CAN DO TO EASE CONGESTION FOR A STATE AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS AND STRENGTHEN OUR SUPPLY. CHAIN WILL NOW GO TO PANEL ONE A GENE SOROKA IS GOING TO BE OUR FIRST PANELISTS- AND HE'S GOING TO- SHARE SOME INFORMATION AND WE'LL HAVE SOME TIME. FOR QUESTIONS FROM HIM AND THEN HE WILL LEAVE THE PANEL. OUR OUR FIRST PANEL WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE GLOBAL CONGESTION CRISIS HAS AFFECTED CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AND THE IMPACT IT HAS HAD ON AGRICULTURAL EXPORTERS ABILITY TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS ON SHELVES AROUND THE WORLD. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME JEANNE SOROKA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES WHO HE WHO IS JOINING US. REMOTELY TO WRITE AN UPDATE- MISTER STROKE AGAIN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AFTERWARD AND JUST FOR A LITTLE CONTEXT- REPORTS DONE ON THE CHASSIS IS THEY DON'T ON THE CONTAINERS. AND THOSE ARE ALL THIRD PARTY OPERATIONS SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE PORK AND SAY HEY TAKE A CHASSIS TO AN AGRICULTURAL- EXPORTER- IT'S THAT'S NOT RALLY THE ROLE OF THE PORTS THEY'RE MORE THEY'RE MORE LANDLORDS BUT- THEY ARE HELPING FACILITATE SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. IMPACTING THE PORTS WELL THAT WILL GO TO MISTER- GENE SOROKA. REPORTER LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU CHERYL DONALD LAND SHARE RIVAS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS EUGENE D. SOROKA ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND I APPRECIATE YOU INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT HEARING. BECAUSE I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA CAN POSITION ITSELF TO REASSERT TRADE LEADERSHIP AND CONVERTED SUPPLY CHAINS INTO A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHILE SUPPORTING OUR VITAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. THREE MESSAGES I'D LIKE TO BRING TO YOU TODAY HOW WE GOT HERE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE THIS ALL STARTED BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON. AND TRADE POLICIES WE BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT NEW POLICY INVOLVING TERRORISTS ON IMPORTED GOODS FROM CHINA AND WERE MET WITH RETALIATORY CHAIR CHERUBS. BY THE PRC. I'M MAINLY AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS FAST FORWARD TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAD BROUGHT IN SO MANY IMPORTS AHEAD OF TERROR OF SIN TAXES ON AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT WE STOPPED IN FACT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES BUSINESS DROPPED BY 16% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BECAUSE WE HAD IMPORTED ALL THAT WE CAN HANDLE AND WE BEGAN TO SEE. THE IMPACT ON EXPORTS AND SPECIFICALLY GROWERS PRODUCERS RANCHERS FARMERS AND THEIR PRODUCTS THAT NEEDED TO GO OVERSEAS THEN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY COBIT NINETEEN HIT THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN CHINA AND THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN THE CHINESE ECONOMY I LIVED IN CHINA FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS I STILL MULTI TREMENDOUS REAL SHIPS- AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THEIR BUSINESS CHECK. YEAH THROUGH ALL OF THIS COBIT NINETEEN CAME TO OUR SHORES IN THE MONTH OF MARCH AND WE SHUT DOWN OUR ECONOMY WITHIN THE FIRST TEN DAYS SO FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS. WE'VE LIMITED IMPORTS COMING INTO THE U. S. AND WE'RE HIT WITH BOTH COBIT NINETEEN AND THE TELLER OF POLICIES THAT IMPACTED UNITED STATES EXPORTS. MOVE FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE MOVED MORE CARGO THAN ANY PORT IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION CONTAINER UNITS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF CARGO BY ANY MEASURE AND 13% GREATER THAN OUR BEST YEAR ON RECORD. WHICH DEVIOUSLY WAS HELD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MORE JUNE UP HERE FOR THE DOCKWORKERS TRUCKERS WAREHOUSE WORKERS ONE IN NINE JOBS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION'S IMAGE. IS IMPACTED BY THIS PORT AND ONE FIFTY TWO NATION WIDE. DURING THIS TIME WE SAW A DECLINE IN EXPORTS THIRTY FOUR OF THE PAST THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS HAVE WITNESSED THOSE DECLINES MAINLY ON THE HEELS OF THAT TRADE POLICY AND SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO RECYCLABLES WHETHER IT BE WASTE PAPER PLASTIC METAL SCRAP. THOSE CARGOES WERE DECLINING AT THE SAME TIME AND CORRESPONDINGLY THE REPOSITIONING OF EMPTY CONTAINERS BACK TO ASIA TO CATCH THE NEXT ROUND OF IMPORTS QT UNITED STATES INCREASED AN INCREASE LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BY 40% ALL REMARKABLY AGRICULTURE EXPORTS HAVE BEEN FLAGGED WE'VE NOT FALL OFF THE CLIP BLADE WE HAVE WITH OTHER COMMODITIES. REMAINING FLAT I BELIEVE THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DO AND LOOKING AT THIS SEGMENT IT VIEW OF AG EXPORTS WE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WITH THE TRADE GAP WIDER THAN EVER. FOR EVERY FIVE CONTAINERS THAT COME INFORMATION ONLY ONE GOES BACK OUT WITH AN AMERICAN EXPORTS THE BALLOT OR ARE EMPTY REPOSITIONED EVERY DAY AND WE HAVE AN OVERHANG OF 30% CAPACITY. WITH OUR RAIL SERVICE GOING OUT OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD WE'VE BEEN WORKING AT THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL LEVEL THE CONVENE PARTIES AND IMPORTANTLY INCLUDING THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MAY WHOSE LEADERS ARE DOMICILED IN ASIA AND EUROPE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CREATE THOSE SOLUTIONS WE'VE LOOKED AT DOING THE BASIC BLOCKING AND TACKLING IMPROVING TRUCK TURN TIMES THE VISIT. OF THOSE TRUCKERS IMPROVING THE RAIL CAPACITY AND HOW WE MOVE CARGO IN AND OUT THERE BUT NO SHORTAGE OF NEWS HELICOPTERS CIRCLING OUR PORT WITH ALL THE CARGO COMING IN BUT I WILL REPORT TO YOU. THAT WE MOVED OUT MORE CARGO THAN EVER BEFORE RETAIL SALES FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON WERE UP EIGHT POINT 5% ADD FOR THE NATION WE ECLIPSE THE BEST MARK EVER. IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH SALES TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER NOW IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP ON WHAT WE WANNA DO EXPORT LICENSE SPECIFICALLY. FOR THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO WORKING ON THAT LATENT CAPACITY WE OF WORKED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE AGENCIES IN WASHINGTON WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE THE ELECTED AND APPOINTED. APPOINTED OFFICIALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO KEEP THESE CONVERSATIONS GOING AND MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. PROPOSALS NUMBER ONE IS THAT SINCE WE PROPOSE THE THREAT OF A FEET ON AGING IMPORT CONTAINERS BACK ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH. WE'VE MOVED OUT 71% OF THAT CARGO THAT WAS SITTING HERE IDLE WITH JUST THE THREAT OF A FEAT WE NEVER COLLECTED A NICKEL BUT WE GOT PRODUCT TO MARKET MORE IMPORTANTLY WE GOT PARTS TO MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. WE GET APPARATUS TO OUR HOSPITALS AND WE GOT FOLLOW THE PRODUCTS TO THE RETAIL SALES GROUPS. WE HAVE ALSO CALLED FOR OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. A NATIONAL AND STATE EXPORT POLICY WE NEED TO GET FARMERS AND MANUFACTURERS BACK IN THE INTERNATIONAL GAME. REMOVING THE US TRADE IMPEDIMENTS THAT ARE ALL HAD POINTS TO IS THE STRENGTH OF THE U. S. DOLLAR IS IMPORTANT ON SO MANY LEVELS ECONOMICALLY BUT- IT'S A PROBLEM CHEAPAIR TO BRAZIL WITH SOYBEANS AND OTHER TRADING NATIONS BECAUSE THEIR EXCHANGE RATES. ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN OURS BUT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PUTTING OUR EXPORTERS IN POSITION TO BE COMPETITIVE AND IN ADDITION TO SO MUCH ELSE THAT WE'RE DOING THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL JUST NOW LAW. AS A PORTION SEVENTEEN BILLION U. S. DOLLARS TO PORTS AND WATERWAYS AND IT WILL HELP US HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN HAND SYSTEM RESILIENCY. AND START FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WHAT WE CALL CONNECTING CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S BRINGING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS THE INLAND EMPIRE IN OTHER REGIONS CLOSER TO THE WATERFRONT OF OUR PORTS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSED BUDGET. DESIGNATE DESIGNATES TWO POINT THREE BILLION U. S. DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN MUNICIPAL PORTS IT PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THE LEVEL OF FUNDING COMMITMENT COMBINED WITH THAT SEVENTEEN BILLION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. REPRESENTS A MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR PORTS ARE SUPPLY CHAINS GLOBALLY AND OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN IT ALSO RECOMMENDS EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ORGANIZING IN THE DEPLOYMENT. OF ZERO EMISSIONS TRUCKS EQUIPMENT AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FURTHER. OTHER LINE ITEMS INCLUDE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATION'S FIRST AND ONLY TRAINING CAMPUS FOR LABOR ACROSS THE GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR IN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING DIGIT IS. THAT CALIFORNIA'S PORTS AS ALWAYS I WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO VISIT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO TESTIFY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT JOB THANK YOU MISTER SOROKA OF FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AGAIN I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS ISSUE. AND WE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE TODAY I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE PRESENCE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA PORT PORT. PADURA MISTER V. THIS IS NEW NAME MISTER VERY. SIMILAR FRIEDMAN IS SIMILAR MATHIS. WHO IS THE CO CHAIR OF THE AGRICULTURAL- AND- SO- MAJORITY LEADER REYES MISTER GIBSON IS ON THE LOWER RIVER COVERS- AND SOON WILL COVER. I ASSUME- THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES- AND ANYBODY ELSE I KNOW MR JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY SO WE HAVE A GOOD GROUP HERE RARELY DO YOU GET THIS MANY MEMBERS AT A- AT AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH THAT ARE THERE QUESTIONS FOR MISTER SOROKA MISTER STROKE ANY QUESTIONS. THIS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION WE SAW YOU LAST TIME I BELIEVE IN THE FALL YOU WERE HERE AS WELL- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT HAS HASN'T WORKED. AND WHAT DO WE NEED MORE- OF FROM EXISTING OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE NEED TO HELP IMPLEMENT. TO MOVE THE EXPORTS ALONG. WHAT IS THE AND I'VE BEEN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR- FOR OVER THREE DECADES AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ALIGNMENT LIKE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. FEDERAL STATE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE AS THE LONE. PUBLIC SECTOR CONVENER. OF THIS LARGELY PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPLY CHAIN ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME MORE MATTER. IF WHAT WE'RE DOING. IT THIS IS NOT ANY FAILURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES OR ANY OF THE OTHER TEN PORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WENT FROM ZERO TO A HUNDRED. IN THE SUMMERTIME OF TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER WE COULDN'T GO TO BALL GAMES ORMOVIES WERE WEREN'T FLYING ON AIRPLANES ARE GOING TO OTHER EVENTS WE WERE AT HOME BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND MA'AM I LIVED IN CHINA. DURING SARS I SAW FIRST HAND WHAT A GLOBAL PANDEMIC COULD MEAN AND THIS WAS MULTIPLE TIMES WORSE THAN ANYTHING WE'VE EVER WITNESSED WE BOUNCE BACK BECAUSE WEEKEND OUTINGS WERE NOW WE'RE TRIP TO COSTCO OR TARGET. VERSUS ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY DO. AT THE SAME TIME TRADE POLICIES NATIONWIDE INHIBITED EXPORTS OF U. S. PRODUCTS AND I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN FARMER NATIONWIDE FOR MY DECADES LONG CAREER IN THIS INDUSTRY THE PHASE ONE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA AS IMPACTED THE AMERICAN FARMER UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN WHETHER IT BE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR OTHER LOCATIONS WE NOW HAVE A VERY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WITH MORE VESSEL IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES THAN EVER BEFORE AND MORE EMPTY CONTAINERS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO PUT GOODS IN THOSE BOXES AND MOVE THEM OVER STATES SO IT'S TIME THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN BRING. COALESCED WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR FROM THE ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS AS WELL AS HERE AT THE MUNICIPALITY IN LOS ANGELES AND WITH THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICAN EXPORTERS I THINK AGRICULTURE HAS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER BUT- WHAT WE MUST DO. IS SHAVE OFF ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES THE FOLKS IN GENERAL HAVE A REPUTATION THAT'S NOT SO GOOD IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN SECTOR WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THEM THE CUSTOMER OF CHOICE. ADDITIONAL STORAGE IN ORIGIN AND DESTINATION LOW PRICES THAT'S A THING OF THE PAST WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUR PRODUCTS TO OVERSEAS MARKETS AND BRING THAT PRIVATE SECTOR SERVICE PROVIDER RATE HERE BACK TO HOME IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN MOVE MORE AG PRODUCTS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL DAIRY FOODS ASSOCIATION THE AGRICULTURAL TRANSPORTATION COALITION. AND THE GREAT WORK OF OUR OWN SECRETARY KAREN ROSS ON THE AG SIDE ALONG WITH SECRETARY TOM VILSACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO BRING THESE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTIES TOGETHER. AS THE CHAIR SAID WE'RE SIMPLY A LANDLORD PORT BUT WE HAVE AN OUTSIZED RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING THESE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTIES TOGETHER AND BRING MORE COMMERCE NOT ONLY TO THE STATE BUT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE. AND MY LAST IS THAT I SAW ONE OF YOUR BULLET POINTS WAS BETTER USE OF EXISTING CAPACITY. IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE BETTER USE OF IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING TOP NOTCH ALL ALONG TO MAKE SURE WE GOT OUR IMPORTS AND EXPORTS UP. SO AGAIN IS THAT THAT IS SOMETHING I'M GONNA KEEP MY EYE ON BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IT ALL ALONG WE SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF VISION AND FORESIGHT- SO AGAIN APPRECIATE PRESENTATION TODAY. AND I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH IN THE FUTURE. AND YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS AGAIN. 55% OF TRUCK GATES GO UNUSED EVERY DAY. 30% OF REAL CAPACITY. IS OUT THERE WAITING FOR INTERMODAL CARGO TO TRANSIT THROUGH OUR PORT FACILITY. IN THIS PRIVATE SECTOR. AREA OF OUR BUSINESS WE'VE GOT THE CAPACITY TO MOVE MORE CARGO CREATE MORE JOB MORE TAX DOLLARS. AND MORE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. THE PRIVATE SECTOR NEEDS TO JOIN YOU. AND ME IN THIS EFFORT THANK YOU. BY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR MISTER STRONG SUPPORTER LOS ANGELES MR FONG. WITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST A FEW QUESTIONS AND A LIST OF ALL OUT THERE AND CAN- LIKE ANSWERED THEM- AS YOU SEE FIT BUT FIRST I WAS WONDERING IF YOU JUST GIVE US A BROAD OVERVIEW HOW MANY SHIPS RIGHT NOW ARE OFF THE OFF THE COAST- WHAT'S THE AVERAGE TO ALL TIME- AS THE TREND GOING DOWN AS YOU GUYS ARE GOING UP AND DOWN LOOKING AT THE DATA IT LOOKS LIKE. WE'VE KIND OF. WE JUST KIND OF WHAT KIND OF STAGNATED A LITTLE BIT AND ONE OF YOU CAN. GVE US A QUICK UPDATE ON THAT. ALSO WANTED TO KNOW- HOW HAS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR OPERATION THE PORTS AND WORKING OUT. OF YOUR PARTNERS IN OTHER PORTS BEEN FOLLOWING SUIT. AS WELL AS WHAT'S BEEN OCCURRING DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH THE WAREHOUSES AND THE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. AND THEN LASTLY- YOU MENTIONED- AND YOU ONE OF YOUR SLIDES AS SUPPLY CHAIN. SUPPLY CHANGES DIGITAL DIGITALIZATION- IN TERMS OF. COULD YOU GO INTO SOME SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPES OF INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE DONE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. EVERY PORT HAS A- A TECHNOLOGY A DATABASE- ITS OWN- PROPRIETARY- YOU KNOW- IT YOU KNOW I. T. SYSTEM. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO KIND OF. BRING MOTHER GATHER HAVE THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER- WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THAT SPACE. THANK YOU MR FONG I'LL GO IN REVERSE ORDER ON ON THE QUESTION OF DIGITIZATION WE'RE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND OTHER OTHER TRADING NATIONS IN THE SYRIAN EL ALL IT'S ABOUT IS INFORMATION SHARING. WE HAVE THAT IN OUR NATIONAL ELECTRICAL ENERGY GRID WE HAVE IT IN AIR TRANSPORTATION. AND ALL OTHER PARTS OF OUR PUBLIC SECTOR WE DON'T HAVE IT. IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN FACT WE CAN TRACK OF PIZZA. COMING FOR MORE ORDER TO OUR HOME BETTER THAN WE CAN TRACK A CONTAINER. WHETHER IT'S KALISTA IN SINGAPORE NEXT PORT IN BELGIUM OR DE COZY IN GERMANY WERE WELL BEHIND OTHER TRADING NATIONS AND MY AT BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN VERY SIMPLE LET'S TAKE THIS DATA SO WE CAN SEE AROUND CORNERS PLAN OUR STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT. TO UNDERSTAND HOW QUICKLY CARGO WAS COMING IN AND WHERE WE CAN DISTRIBUTE IT WHAT WE SEEN SO FAR FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND SOME OF OUR PUBLIC SECTOR COUNTERPARTS. IS THE FEAR THAT IT WILL IMPROVE LESSER SERVING PROVIDERS AND WE'VE GOT TO GET PAST THAT WE'RE ONLY ASKING FOR GENERIC INFORMATION ORIGIN DESTINATION WHERE YOUR CARGO WAS GONNA GO NEXT ON RAIL OR TRUCK. NO ONE IS GONNA STRIP A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FROM OUR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SECTOR PARTNERS WE'VE GOT A KNOCK THAT OUT AND MOVE FORWARD LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS DONE. ON THE OTHER TRANSPORT CENTERS I WILL REPORT TO YOU ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATION WE'RE SHORT EIGHTY THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS NATIONWIDE AND HERE THE HARBOR DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE MAY BE SHORT THREE FOUR EVEN FIVE THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS. THESE BOOKS ARE ASKED TO WORK NO MORE THAN ELEVEN HOURS A DAY OR IF THEY WERE CONSECUTIVELY TO TAKE TIME OFF EVEN THE NOTION OF WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CAN'T BE ACCOMPLISHED. IN LESS WE HAVE ENOUGH TALENT WE'VE GOT TO RECRUIT ATTRACTIVE RETAIN BETTER FOLKS RECREATE THIS PROFESSION. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A TEAMSTER DRIVING FOR THE AMERICAN CAN COMPANY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR FORTY YEARS. HE PLEDGE THROUGH SCHOOL HE REYES GRANDCHILDREN THROUGH A PROFESSION WE GOT TO BRING THAT BACK HOME HERE TO CALIFORNIA WHERE HOUSING WE BOAST TWO BILLION SQUARE FEET FROM THE SHORES OF THE PACIFIC. OUT TO THE DESERT REGION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTEREST KNOW WHETHER WHERE HOUSING COMPLEX IN THE WORLD HAS THIS CAPACITY YET NATIONWIDE WERE SHORT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WERE SHORT AND THOUSAND NOW WE SEE SIGNS UP HELP WANTED. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WITHOUT BENEFITS. WE NEED TO RECREATE THAT PROFESSION WHEN I STARTED IN THIS INDUSTRY. YOU CAN BEGIN THIS UP BOX PERSON RISE UP TO A SUPERVISOR ONE DAY MANAGE THAT ENTIRE WAREHOUSE WE GOTTA GET THE PROFESSION ACT IN OUR WAREHOUSE A COMPLEX AS WE BUY MORE AT THE RETAIL LEVEL AN ONLINE. WE PICK UP AT OUR CURBSIDE WE'VE GOT CARGO COMING IN THAT IS CO MINGLED WITH TRADITION CENTERS CROSS STOCKS AND FOR BILL MENSAH'S FACILITIES WE NEED TO WERE WRECKED MORE FACILITIES SEQUEL HAS BEEN AN INHIBITOR TO THAT. WHILE WE DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST THE THIRD RAIL WE HAVE GOT TO SUPPORT THE NATION'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND THE CARGO THAT MOVES THROUGH THIS PORT REACHES EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR NATION'S FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS TO BE ON CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ONE IN FIFTY TWO JOBS NATIONWIDE. AND YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY SHIPS ARE ON THE WAY HOW MANY TO RANCOR I WOULD ADVISE YOU SIR POLITELY. NOT TO MESS SHIPS THE CARGO SHIPS THAT ARE ON THEIR WAY LEAVING ASIA AND READY TO ENTER THE SPORT COMPLEX REPRESENT ABOUT TWO WEEKS. OF WORK HERE AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES IF WE HAD MORE TRUCKERS IF WE HAD MORE WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND THE ABILITY TO ABSORB THIS CARGO IN PLACES LIKE JOLIET ILLINOIS WEST MEMPHIS ARKANSAS ARKANSAS. AND ALLIANCE OUTSIDE OF FORT WORTH WE COULD BRING MORE CARGO THROUGH THIS PORT COMPLEX THE CARD. IS ON HIS WAY RIGHT NOW REPOR SINCE AN EARLY LUNAR NEW YEAR WHICH JUST STORE YES. IN ASIA WE'LL SEE THOSE LANDINGS COMING IN THIRD FOURTH WEEK OF FEBRUARY AND THEN AS MAJOR RETAILERS AND HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES TELL ME THE SECOND QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WILL BE A BOON TO THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY. BECAUSE WE'LL BE SEEING MORE REPLENISHMENT INVENTORY COMING THROUGH THE INVENTORY SALES RATIO NATIONWIDE RIGHT NOW IS THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IF WE GET THROUGH THESE TWO SEGMENTS WELL AND I BELIEVE WE WILL AS THE UPPLY CHAIN INDUSTRY DRIVEN BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL MOVE TO AN EARLY PEAK SEASON IN LATE JUNE EARLY JULY. AND START BRINGING IN THOSE SEATS PRODUCTS AS WELL AS HOLIDAY GOODS THROUGH THE NATION'S LARGEST GATEWAY. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU I JUST WHAT IF I GUESS ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN TERMS OF I THINK YOUR FIRST YEAR NO ANSWER TO MY FIRST COURT- FIRST QUESTION. AND THEY HAVE MY AT YOUR ANSWER TO THAT THEIR QUESTION GO TOGETHER IN TERMS OF INFORMATION SHARING I THINK THAT IS AN EMPHASIS THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON- KIND OF IN THE SAME VEIN AS MY- MY COLLEAGUE FOR WINTERS. IS THAT WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS AND IN REAL TIME AS CHAIR MENTION. YOU KNOW OF OUR AG GUYS CAN'T FIND CONTAINERS IT MIGHT. BE NECESSARY TO KNOW AND TRACK WHERE THOSE CONTAINERS ARE IN SO YOU FOR THIRTY YEARS BEHIND TO WORK AT THE CATCH UP VERY VERY QUICKLY. AND IF THE METRICS YOU'RE SAYING IS. DON'T LOOK AT THE SHIPS OF THE SEA OF THE CONTAINERS OFF THE COAST WELL WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT. APPLE WE NEED. DATA TO- TO UNDERSTAND. THE OF THE PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND I CERTAINLY. AND SYMPATHETIC TO THE FACT THAT WE GOT CHOKEPOINTS EVERYWHERE. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE MAY BE INVESTING MORE MONEY IN THE I. T. SPACE. AND INFORMATION SHARING SPACE AND I WOULD JUST ASK. NOW THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US A THREE THOUSAND FOOT VIEW HOW DO WE EXECUTED. IF WE'RE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ARE ALL SPOT ON. AND WHILE I SAY DON'T LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF SHIPS COMING IN THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S A LAND USE SYMBOL LAS CITY ISSUE. NUMBER OF DAYS THAT CONTAINERS SIT IMPACT THE ABILITY TO MOVE CARGO THROUGH OUR PORTS RAIL AND TRUCK ACTIVITIES CARGILL IS SITTING LONGER THAN EVER AND WHILE BACK IN OCTOBER. WE ANNOUNCED A PENALTY FEE ON CARGO THAT WAS SITTING NINE DAYS OR LONGER TO THIS MALL WE'VE NEVER COLLECTED A DIME BUT WE REDUCE THOSE AGING CONTAINERS. BY 71% AS OF THIS MORNING AND THE REASON WE DID THAT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD ACCESS TO THIS DATA AND UNDERSTOOD HAD A SEGMENT CARGO THERE WAS NO PUBLIC SHAMING OF THOSE RETAILERS WHO BROUGHT IN TV'S AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL LAST JUNE. LOUNGE CHAIRS PATIO FURNITURE THAT DIDN'T NEED TO GET TO MARKET IN COMPETITION WITH HOLIDAY GOODS PRODUCTS FOR MACHINES FOR HOSPITALS AND THOSE FACTORY PARTS THAT NEEDED TO GET TO THE MANUFACTURER'S FLOORS WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND PUSH ASIDE. THE OBSTRUCTIONISTS WHO DON'T WANT TO SHARE DATA AT ITS GENERIC IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND IT ALLOWS US TO PREPARE OUR STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT TO MOVE EVEN MORE CARGO AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU LOOK AT. IS THE DWELL TIME HOW LONG CONTAINER SET WHETHER THEY BE ON SHIPS. ON DOCK WAITING FOR RAIL OR WAITING FOR TRUCK IF THE VELOCITY THOSE CONTAINERS START TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY YOUR THROUGHPUT CAPACITY AT THE STATE'S ELEVEN PORTS. ALSO INCREASES WE POST ALL THESE AND MANY OTHER MEASURES ON THE HERO SLIDE OF OUR PORT WEBSITE EVERY DAY AND THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS AS WELL AS LINKED IN ON A DAILY BASIS I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO MORE OFF LINE. ABOUT WHAT WE MEASURE IN THE LOGISTICIANS LOOK AT TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLY CHAIN BUT YOU'RE. SPOT ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. BUT JUST ONE HIGHLIGHT DWELL TIME HE ACTUALLY OF ISSUE. GARNERED A LOT OF IN THE PRESS. BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED RIGHT BUT IT'S BEEN A CITY IT APPEARS AS A BETTER SIGNIFICANT MOTIVATOR TO CLEAN SOME OF THE CONTAINERS OFF. THE DOCKS IS THAT ACCURATE. IT DOESN'T APPEAR IT WORKED THERE IS 71% OF THOSE AGING CONTAINERS THAT MOVED OFF DOCK WE- RETAILERS WHO IMPORT PRODUCTS THAT HAD UNBELIEVABLY RICH AGREEMENTS TO USE THE PORT. AS A STORAGE FACILITY WE SMOKE THEM OUT WE DIDN'T PUBLICLY SHAME THEM BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THESE OTHER PRODUCTS TO MARKET BY SEGMENTING THAT CARGO WAS SIDE AND I THINK IS NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF CONTRACTING SEASON BETWEEN THE OCEAN LINER COMPANIES AND THOSE IMPORTERS OF RECORD WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DISCIPLINE AND HOW WE MANAGE CARGO THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE SPORTS. GREAT OUTDOOR MAJORITY LEADER. DISTRESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER STRUCK I REPRESENTED THE INLAND EMPIRE THE HEART OF THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY. AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM OCTOBER HE DID DIRECT THE STATE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTES TO BE CONSIDERED TO ALLOW TRUCKS TO CARRY MORE GOODS. MIKE MY QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THE PORT OF LA WHAT ROUTES HAVE YOU ALL IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTES AND WHAT CRITERIA DID YOU USE TO DETERMINE THOSE. THE CARGO THAT THOUGHT COMES THROUGH OUR PORT HERE IN LOS ANGELES IS SEGMENTED IN THREE WAYS NUMBER ONE THAT WHICH MOVES BY A TRUCK THAT GOES TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY POPULATION IS YOU KNOW. OF ABOUT TEN MILLION PEOPLE. THE NEXT SEGMENT IS THE CARGO THAT MOVES OUT TO YOUR AREA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF WAREHOUSES DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND FULFILLMENT LOCATIONS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE BALANCE THIRD IS THE INTACT INTERNATIONAL OCEAN BOX THAT GETS LOADED ON DOCK WITH RAIL THEY MOVES OUT TO CHICAGO MEMPHIS DALLAS ATLANTA AND OTHER LOCATIONS ALL OF THESE CORRIDORS ARE IMPORTANT TO US. WHAT I'VE RECOMMENDED TO THE INDUSTRY AND IN MY BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS IS THAT WE SEGMENT THAT CARGO. AND HOW BETTER WE CAN APPORTION IT LOADING TO THE SHIPS IN ASIA WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES HERE ONCE IT REACHES THE SHORES AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF WE CAN UNLOAD CARGO THAT'S MOVING TO THE RP OVERNIGHT. WAYS AND ROAD RACING AWAY FROM COMMUTERS AND SCHOOL BUSES WE GET THE PRODUCTS OUT TO YOUR LOCATIONS QUICKER AND TO THOSE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES WERE OFFERING UPPER GATES HERE SO TRUCKERS WHO ARE TYPICALLY PAID BY THE RUN. DON'T HAVE TO SIT IN LINE FOR HOURS ON TIME. ALSO BY CREATING INLAND CONTAINER DEPOTS WHETHER THEY BE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR IN THE I. E. WILL ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE NEW AND BETTER CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES THANK WILL HELP IN SPOKE CONCEPT. RUNNING THE CARGO OUT TO LOCATIONS IN THE ID AND THE DISTRIBUTING THAT WAS ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY ON HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TO WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS CLOSER BY CAN ALLOW THE ACCELERATION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. LAUT TRUCK DRIVERS TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN THEY CAN WORK THEY COULD BE HOME FOR DINNER AT NIGHT THEY CAN WORK OVERNIGHT IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WISH TO DO. AND IT'S A BETTER PLAN SUPPLY CHAIN LIKE MANY OTHER TRADING NATIONS HAVE THAT WE CAN USE TO BRING THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. TO A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTES THOUGH. AND FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE HAVE THOSE BEEN IDENTIFIED ALREADY. WHERE ARE WE ON THE IN THAT PROCESS IN RESPONSE TO. ORDER I WOULD YOU TO FIND A PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTE MA'AM. THAT'S THE QUESTION IS THAT. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- CHARGED. CHARGED YOU WITH PUTTING TOGETHER THE PRIORITY FREIGHT ROUTES AND I THINK IF THERE'S A QUESTION TO THE QUESTION IS TO THE GOVERNOR. IF HE HAS IF THIS ISN'T HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER THEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE IS ASKING BE DONE. IT'S AN EXIT BOTH THE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY RESIGN RESIDE WITH CALLOUS TO AND DOES OF FEDERAL DOT WERE. ALWAYS WORKING WITH BOTH AGENCIES AND AGAIN I'LL LET THE DATA TAKE ME WHERE YOUR QUESTION LIES PRIORITY FROM BROWN'S. INLAND EMPIRE ONE THIRD OF THE OF THE CARGO THAT MOST YEAR CARLA MOVES THROUGH LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THE SECOND THIRD THE INTACT OCEAN BOX MOVING TO THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY IS THE THIRD. THAT PRIORITY FREE ROUTE AS DESIGNATED NETTY IO WILL LEND US TO NOT ONLY PUBLIC SECTOR DESIGNATION AND BUDGETS BUT- PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY TO FOLLOW SO HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT THIS OFF LINE IT'S A LITTLE NUANCED. BUT I THINK WHERE YOU'RE GOING IS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE TO HELP SUPPORT YOUR AREA. THANK YOU. MISTER VEHICLE NIGHT I. THE PROBLEM. AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP ABOUT TRUCKING RIGHT- AND THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM THAT WE ALL NEED TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE- THIRTY PERCENT. HAVE RETIRED AND IT'S GONNA BE EVEN A BIGGER ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DIVE INTO. THE THAT I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR YOU BRING THAT UP THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT I KEEP HEARING IS THAT. IT'S A SECURITY ISSUE FOR DRIVERS TO GET THROUGH THE PORT. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. IS THAT SLOWING THIS DOWN WHEN THEY GET TO THE PORT. I HAVE BEEN AT THIS PORT FOR EIGHT YEARS I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SECURITY ISSUE THAT IMPEDES TRUCKERS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF ALL PORT WORKERS ADMINISTRATIVE OR OPERATIONAL IS FRONT OF MIND EVERY DAY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME EVEN PRE DATING MY TIME HERE. IS HOW LONG IT TAKES THE TRUCKER TO ENTER. THE HARBOR DISTRICT AREA KITTY INSIDE THE MARINE TERMINAL PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATED. DROP OFF THEIR INTO YOUR EXPORT KICK UP THEIR LOADED CONTAINER A MOVE IT BACK TO THE CUSTOMER THAT WE MUTUALLY SHARE. OF SECURITY IS NOT AN ISSUE HERE AT THE NATION'S LARGEST PORT BUT WHAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS LARGE. OVER RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS OR THE FUNDS TIMELY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE. FIFTHS OF RAIL CARS OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES PROPER IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE REGION WITH THIEVES RUMMAGING THROUGH RAIL CONTAINERS LOOKING FOR PARCELS AND PACKAGES AND OTHER GOODS TO DISTRIBUTE FOR THEIR OWN USE WORKING WITH THE ALLIED AGENCIES AND LED BY PORT POLICE CHIEF AND HEAD OF PUBLIC SAFETY TOM CASEY. WE HAVE AN EYE ON EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA THE HELP THE PRIVATE SECTOR BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE RAILROAD UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD WHO JUST BECAUSE IT IT US YESTERDAY. OUR POLL WORKING TOGETHER AND SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR THE TRUCKER INJURING THIS PORT IS ALWAYS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US AND NOT AN IMPEDIMENT. TO THOSE DRIVERS THAT COME HERE. WELL I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE I READ REPRESENT THE PORT OF STOCKTON. AND I JUST WANTED TO ASSURE EVERYONE HERE IN THIS ROOM THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER THIS IS NOT A ABOUT A COMPETITION OF CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE COMPETING THE WITH ANYONE IT MIGHT BE SOMEONE FROM AT BAKKIES BUT- THE PORT OF STOCKTON. ARE HERE TO HELP WE'RE WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE I ALWAYS HERE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT- MYSTERY TO ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TAG WHICH IS VERY DEAR TO OUR HEART. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HELPING WERE SUPPLEMENTING. THE IN PART OF THE PORT ISSUES SO TRACKING IS ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE. SOMETHING THAT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP BECAUSE- TRUCK A TRUCK DRIVER GET A THEIR CLASS LICENSE THIRTY DAYS OKAY SB BEHIND A RIG. AND WORKING- AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING SOME. SOME VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN THAT HELLO THIS IS THIS CAN THIS COULD BE. A QUICK FIX. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE SUPPORTING FOLKS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU. SB A VOTER I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING WE TALK ABOUT SECURITY MIGHT BE THE NEED FOR A TWIX CARD TO GET ON THE PORT PROPERTY. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO JUST LET ANYONE WALK ON PORT PROPERTY BECAUSE A HOMELAND SECURITY ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YOU WANT TO QUICKLY COMMENT ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER CHAIR YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THE TRANSPORTATION WORKER IDENTIFICATION CARD OF WHICH I HOLD ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE THAT COMES INTO THESE ELEVEN PORTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE ABSOLUTELY A NECESSITY. AND FOR FOLKS TO OPEN UP THIS AREA MAKE SURE THEY QUALIFY. DRUG TESTING CREDENTIALS WORKING FOR A COMPANY. CAPITALIZED CENTER ARE ALL FRONT AND CENTER AND IT'S LED BY THE FEDERAL INITIATIVES. TO THE STATE LEVEL HERE TO MUNICIPALITIES IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS FAIRNESS ACROSS THE BOARD. OF COURSE I AM AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ALL TIMES. GREAT THANK YOU ADJUST QUICKLY- COULD YOU GO OVER THE CALIFORNIA CONNECT. EFFORT YOU HAVE. YEAH THE IDEA IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND ALTHOUGH OUR INDUSTRY IS SO NUANCED AND COMPLEX AND IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE WORKED UP STILL LEARNING SOMETHING EVERY DAY BUT THE IDEAS IS SIMPLE BRING THE SHORT THE PACIFIC CLOSER TO WHERE THE CARGO IS WHETHER IT BE IN THE COUNTY OF MERCED UP TO STOCKTON AND FRESNO OUT TO THE INLAND EMPIRE TO RANCHO CUCAMONGA ONTARIO IT'S CETERA LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING CARGO IN THE CARGO OWNERS CLOSER TO THE PORT. TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S QUESTION EARLIER THESE KEY CORRIDORS THAT WE'VE CALLED IN VARIOUS PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS BUT IT'S ABOUT BRINGING CARGO OUT THERE SWIFTER AND QUICKER AND IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY FIRE RAIL OR TRUCK TO HAVE EASY ACCESS CREATE GREEN GATES OF OUR TERMINALS AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET CARGO ON RAIL FOR MERCED DOWN TO THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES INTO AN INDIVIDUAL TERMINAL IT MAKES THE SPEED AND EFFICIENCY OF THE SPORT. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT A THIRD OF THE CARGO ON THE IMPORT SIDE GOES OUT TO THE I. E. WE'D LIKE RECIPROCAL CARGO COMING BACK AND AGAIN IF WE COULD MOVE IT DURING OFF PEAK HOURS FREE UP THE GATES FOR THOSE MERCHANTS AND STORE OWNERS THAT NEED CARGO IN IT JUST IN TIME BASIS WITH THOSE WHO NEED IT JUST IN CASE THAT MAKES OUR BUSINESS PROPOSITION EVEN MORE. IMPORTANT TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRADER COUNTRY AND PARTNER THAT WE WANT. TO BRING IT TO THIS COMPLEX. GREAT THANK YOU- AYE MR SIRI. I DO AND I JUST WHAT DO YOU KNOW. A THE STATE'S ROLE- YOU TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ANOTHER IS A BUDGET ASKING FOR THAT FROM THE PORTS BOTH PORTS. AND ALSO SOME MONEY FOR OFFICERS AND HARD INFRASTRUCTURE. AND YOU CITED SEEK WAS BEING A CHALLENGE IT LOOKS SEEK WAS QUITE FRANKLY PUT US IN A STALEMATE. WE CAN'T DO IT LESS ZERO BUT WE DON'T HAVE ZERO WE CAN'T DO IT. SO THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS MAYBE WE GO NEAR ZERO AND THEN WHEN THE TIME COMES GO TO ZERO WHEN THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE. SO THAT SOMETHING POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO CONSIDER BECAUSE SPORTS HAVE TO MAKE GREEN TO GO GREEN. AND WE NEED MORE VELOCITY WE NEED MORE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME- VERNON LOOKS TO HAVE TO LOOK CLOSELY AT HOW WE CAN USE SEQUENCE TO ACHIEVE CERTAINLY ARE GREEN GOALS BUT ALSO OUR GOALS OF MOVING. GOODS THROUGH THE PORTS MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH THAT I THINK YOU MISTER SOROKA. AS DOES THE REST OF THE PANEL WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO OUR NEXT- MISTER STROKE IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE. SO THANK AGAIN. I WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE REST OF OUR PANEL AND- I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE. A MIKE JACOB HE'S VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL AT PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PMSA- MISTER- JACOB YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE- READY WHEN YOU APPEAR. AND YOU COULD ALSO MAYBE EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF PIANO SAY AS WELL. WHAT YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES BURKE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- GEN AND- GENERATED SOME MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPTION TO BE HERE TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AND FOCUSING ON HOW TO IMPROVE CALPERS BACK AT WORK ECONOMY GIVEN WHERE WE ARE- THAT CAME AS A HAVE YOU NOTED WE REPRESENT BLAME TERMINAL OPERATORS AND OCEAN CARRIERS- HAND WRITTEN BY TO TODAY TO FOLLOW UP ON. MISTER SIROCCO STREAMLINING PRESENTATION TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE PRESENTED NOW THAT ACTUALLY MOVES INTO THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT WHY IS IT IMPORTANT THAT THE LOCAL I. PANDEMIC INTO SUPPLY CHAIN SYMPTOMS THAT THAT EXACTLY DIRECTOR SIR OKAY JUST OUTLINED- AND HOW DO THEY MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN THE PORT. WHAT SHOULD THE REASON WHY WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IMPORTS IN ORDER TALK ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE EXPORTS AND I THINK WHAT YOU HEARD FROM HIM IN YOUR JACKLEY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE FOCUS ON THE NEWS VERY VERY BRIEF CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOVE LONG DWELLING IMPORTANT VIEWS OFF OF OUR CONGESTED TERMINALS FIRST AND FOCUS ON MAC IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO SOMETHING THAT. LOOKS LIKE OUR PRE COATED EQUILIBRIUM OUT OF PLACE BRING UP CHASSIS IS IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE WOMEN AVAILABLE BOTH FOR IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS THROUGHOUT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE PORTS FINISH- DAMAGING MENTIONED ON THE SIX AT THE MOVING ALONG WELL AND GIVES OFF THAT WAS REALLY A RESULT OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PORT PARTNERS. HAPPY MORNING TERMINAL OPERATORS AT THE TABLE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON A MEMBER STATE LEADERS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE KEEP A GOOD MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM CONTINUE- AND WE EXPAND ON THEM WINNING BEST IN THE MOVING FORWARD- TO THE OPERATIONAL QUESTION VERY DIRECTLY- OUR SYSTEM WIDE CONGESTION DURING THE. JIM WAS TALKING ABOUT MANIFESTED SO IN A TERM. SO AN ARMORY TERMINAL OPERATOR- WE HAVE SO MUCH ACREAGE SOME ABILITY TO MOVE CARGO. WHEN THAT TERMINAL IS FOR. OF CAR. IN LATER. EXPORT WORK. IT'S OUR VESSEL LOW AND I TO. THAT EXTRA OUR TIME IN BIRTH- AND WHEN WE EXTEND TIME OF BIRTH WE HAVE LATEST. THE DEAD LATEST PHYSICS WE'VE SEEN WITH THAT THROUGH Q. FOUR OF TWO THOUSAND TWO ONE AVERAGE TIME FOR BOTH OF THE BIRTH IN NORTH. WAS SEVEN DAYS THAT'S 20% LONGER THAN WAS PRETTY PENDEK IN THE CASCADES WE SHIP STATE OF BIRTH LONGER THERE'S BEEN FURTHER OFF SCHEDULE. AND WHEN THEY'RE OFF SCHEDULE THE BACK OF THE SHIP BEHIND THEM PUTTING THEM FURTHER OFF SCHEDULE WHEN SHIPS ARE COLLECTIVELY DELAYED NOT SCHEDULING NORTH AMERICA. THAT'S THE WAY THINKING JOBS THE RETURN TO ASIA WE END UP WITH SKIP SAILINGS MISS SAILINGS AN ADDITIONAL DELAY ALL OF THESE THINGS. BASICALLY. RESULT IN LESS CAPACITY. EIGHT TIMES HI RATES MARKOFF'S. PROFICIENCY WHY WE'RE DEALING WITH HIGH VOLUME- YOU KNOW. AGAIN WE CAN'T REEMPHASIZED ENOUGH AND IT PROBABLY GOES WITHOUT SAYING- BUT I WANT TO REITERATE HERE. WE ARE MOVING MORE CARGO THAN EVER BEFORE. IN THE MIDST OF PANDEMIC IT IS WORTH AGAIN TAKING THE TIME OUT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR DEDICATED WATERFRONT LABOR FORCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS. MOVING AS A CENTRAL WORKERS IN THIS ECONOMY HAS BEEN TOUGH PEOPLE ARE DOING IT- BUT- TO THE POINT OF THIS THIS HEARING- WE HAVEN'T DONE A PERFECT- IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MISSTEPS AND THOSE COSTS ARE THEN REFLECTED IN THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY OUT OF BALANCE BY FOCUSING ON WHAT WE CAN CONTROL AND THAT'S TRYING TO REDUCE TERMINAL CONGESTION. THE OTHER CONTEXTS BROTHER THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THAT- THE ACTUAL WAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PORT ECOSYSTEM IS STILL IN THE CONTEXT OF PRE COATED AND IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIALLY FRAMED BY THE CONTEXT WITHIN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT TRADE DEFICIT. THE UNITED STATES ISN'T IMPORTING NATION- AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE AN IMBALANCE IN TOTAL TRADE BUT WE FOUND AN EQUILIBRIUM FOR EVERY CAN CAN ONLY BRING AND EVENTUALLY THAT NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE JUST MOVED WHETHER IT'S FULL OR EMPTY- AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THE NORMAL TIMES IS THAT THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO OUR EXPORTERS- IN THE QUICK EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THE OVERSIMPLIFICATION CARE ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO BE THIS MORNING- AND I. THINK IT BECAUSE OF THE TO THE POINT OF SAYING. WHEN WE HAVE A ROBUST IMPORT ECONOMY. THOSE IMPORTS OF SAP AFFECTIVELY SUBSIDIZE OUR ABILITY TO GROW IN CALIFORNIA THEY UNDER RIGHT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS PRIVATELY FINANCED OUR LABOR FORCE. AND ON A PER UNIT BASIS THE MORE CARGO THAT WERE MOVING ON IMPORT CAPACITY REDUCING PER UNIT COSTS FOR EXPORTERS AND IN A PRE CODED EQUILIBRIUM SITUATION WE WERE ABLE TO FACILITATE A LOT OF EXPORTS TO ESSENTIALLY AT LEVELSWHICH WERE NON COMPENSATORY THERE VERY WELL. AS JEAN POINTED. OUT WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT BACK TO THAT. SEARCH BUT WE WANT TO HAVE THE INCENTIVES IN PLACE TO DO THAT THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY- OUR LONG TERM GOAL AND WORKING WITH OUR EXPORT PARTNERS. IS B. RESUMPTION OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL SIX- AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE ANT TO WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY. WITH OUR EXPORT PARTNERS ARE OCEAN CURRENTS MAUREEN TERMINALS ARE WORKING WITH THEM BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES- IN MANY RESPECTS IMPORTING A BOXES. MUCH EASIER THAN EXPORTING. SECOND PANEL FROM FOLKS. A LOT OF EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO A LOT OF FRUSTRATION WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM. YOU CANNOT JUST PICK UP AN EMPTY AND EXPORTED IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT CAN YOU DEFINE THE RIGHT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT IF YOU CAN FIND THE EQUIPMENT- AND WE NEED TO WORK MUCH MORE CLOSELY WITH YOUR KERRIER IN YOUR TERMINAL TO GET A BOX. INCLUDING AN EXPORT SO WITH THAT I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. AGAIN WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP- AND EDUCATION WE'VE BEEN PREAHING THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE COMPETITIVE SPOKE WITH RESPECT TO IMPORT EXPORT CARGO. FOR DECADES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL WORKING. WITH US SOMETIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JACOB WILL HOLD QUESTIONS WERE JUST A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SECRETARY ROSS MISTER. YEAH AND SO WITH US WE HAVE- SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE- THIS KAREN ROSS. SECRETARY ROSS I BELIEVE IT WILL BE WITH US- VIA. WEBEX AND FROM HOW THE GUEST ROOM YEAH A GOOD MORNING MR IT MINING WITH THE CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE TWO SPEAKERS BEFORE ME I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH GENE OVER THE YEARS- AND MIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK WE'VE REALLY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEMS AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THERE IS NO ONE ANSWER AND THERE IS NO ONE STAKEHOLDER THIS REQUIRES THIS VERY COMPLICATED MULTI DIMENSIONAL SYSTEM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON REQUIRES EVERYONE AS STAKEHOLDERS. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TO COME TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUES FROM COPIOUS AND THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FOR BENJAMIN JUST PARTNERS THEY ARE THE CO CHAIRS OF THE GOVERNOR SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE- AND JUST THE WORK THAT THEY DID GOING BACK SEVEN MONTHS AGO WITH THE FIRST ON THAT I KNOW OF A FULL SUPPLY CHAIN OF SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS SUMMIT WE'VE HAD SEVERAL UP FOLLOW UP MEETINGS TO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING SHORT TERM INTERMEDIATE TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. BUT LET ME PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS BECAUSE AG EXPORTS ARE ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST SPOTS IN THE TRADE PICTURE FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE UNITED STATES TO HELP BRING THE BALANCE OF TRADE AND. INTO PLACE AND THAT'S WHY. IN THE BEGINNING OF MUCH OF OUR TIME ON THE EMPTY ISSUE AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHELVES WERE FULL OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NOW MANUFACTURE OVERSEAS- AG EXPERTS WERE GETTING AS MUCH ATTENTION- AND MANY IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR WORK HARD IN WASHINGTON DC AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO RAISE THESE. ISSUES THE STUDY THAT YOU REFERENCE MISTER CHAIR OF OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF LOST OPPORTUNITY AND EXPORTS ARE VERY ACCURATE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THAT STUDY THAT UC DAVIS WAS A PART OF. ITS SOBERING AND IT UNDERSCORES THE MANY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ABOUT MODERNIZING OUR SYSTEM AND HAVING A REAL CLEAR VISION. OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GETS MOVEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND IMPROVING. ALL OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I RECALL LAW EXPERTS ARE ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS BUT WHAT SOME MEANINGFUL ABOUT THE ACTIVITY OF WHAT STARTS IN OUR FIELDS ARE PASTORS AND OUR ORCHARDS. IS THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF THAT FARMGATE VALUE. GOING THROUGH THE CHANGE TO GO TO AN EXPORT MARKET CREATES AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR AND THIRTY ONE CENTS OF ACTIVITY. SO THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS THAT ARE THE RESULT OF WHAT WE GROW HERE ADD VALUE TO HEAR. AND SHIP THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO REACH CONSUMERS HERE AND AROUND THE GLOBE. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ACTIVITY IT'S AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S REALLY IMPACTING LOCAL ECONOMIES. AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF THE JOB CREATION. ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND LABOR THAT ARE TOUCHING OUR PRODUCTS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT STARTS ON THE FARM BUT THERE ARE MANY HAS THAT TOUCH IT ALONG THE WAY. WE ACTUALLY EXPORT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. BUT OUR TOP EXPORT MARKETS ARE YOU. CANADA JAPAN. CHINA SOUTH KOREA AND MEXICO. THIS TIME OF YEAR WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED WITH THE START OF THE LUNAR NEW YEAR IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR HIGH QUALITY HIGH VALUE SPECIALTY CROPS FROM CALIFORNIA THE LUNAR NEW YEAR IS A PRIME SHIPPING TIME FOR US AND FOR MANY OF OUR CROPS IT IS THE MOST CRITICAL TIME OF THE YEAR FOR THEIR EXPORT PRODUCTS. I'LL TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT- I WAS ASKED TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN TO SOME OF OUR COMMODITIES AND I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. I'LL START WITH ORANGES BECAUSE IT MIGHT MAKE A TRIP TO CHINA AND VIETNAM AND SINGAPORE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A BEAUTIFUL FRESH ORANGE THAT MAKES IT HIGHLY DESIRABLE IT'S HEALTHY IT'S NUTRITIOUS AT THAT REPRESENTS A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE AND ARE IN HIGH DEMAND THIS TIME OF THE YEAR FOR ALL THE FAMILY CELEBRATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AT THE CURRENT TIME IT'S TAKING AT LEAST TEN ADDITIONAL DAYS. FOR THAT CARGO SHIP WITH BOTH FRESH ORANGES TO REACH HONG KONG AND THEN BE SHIPPED THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA. THOSE TEN ADDITIONAL DAYS START TO IMPACT THE QUALITY. THEY HAVE CAUSED SOME RELUCTANCE BY SOME OF THE FIRES TO PLACE THEIR ORDERS NOT KNOWING IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT AND WHAT CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO BE AN- AND OFTENTIMES THEY'RE ASKING FOR COMPENSATION SO. THERE'S MANY WAYS THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL COSTS IN THE SYSTEM OF GETTING OUR GUESTS TO THESE MARKETS- AND IT'S COMING AT A TIME WHERE WE MAY BE LOSING CUSTOMERS SO THE FOCUS OF OUR AG EXPORTERS. HAS BEEN VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON TAKING EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO KEEP THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO BRING THEM BACK. AND THAT'S A CASE. THEY. THINK ARE SUCH AS SHOPPERS. JUST JUST THE CALIFORNIA ONE FOR. AND I KNOW THIS ONE IS NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. BUT THEY ANNOUNCED WITH THE INVENTORY IS AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THEY DO THAT ON FEBRUARY FIRST OF EVERY YEAR. THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THE CURRENT INVENTORY OF IN SHELL WALNUTS IS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION POUNDS. THAT COMPARES TO RECOUNT GAP EIGHT NORMAL LEVELS OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS. THE ALMOND INDUSTRY IS CALCULATING THAT THEIR SUPPLY RIGHT NOW AND INVENTORY IS BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS. AT A TIME THAT NORMALLY IS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS. IN THE CASE OF WALNUTS IN PARTICULAR BUT FOR ALL OF THESE CLASS WHEN YOU BACK UP INVENTORY OF PERISHABLE SPECIALTY CROPS LIKE THAT. AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. IT WILL HAVE A CASCADING IMPACTS FOR THE INDUSTRY FOR MULTIPLE YEARS BECAUSE OF DECREASING CRISIS AND TRYING TO FIND ALTERNATIVE MARKETS FOR THOSE CROPS. IN WALNUTS IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THAT CHILE WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE THAT PRODUCER WILL START THEIR HARVEST IN APRIL. AND IT MAY BE MORE DESIRABLE FOR SOME OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. TO SORT. OUT OF CHILEANS THAT. WHAT OF THE THINGS THAT I'M THAT FRIEND AND- IN MUTUAL HOW FROM THE FARM WILL TOUCH ON IT IS NOT ONLY HOW AT IS BEING IMPACT BY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE EXPORTS. TRYING TO GET THEM OUT TRYING TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS TRYING TO KEEP PRICES AT A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL BUT ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR ALL THOSE MANUFACTURED GOODS. THAT ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY AND ARE COMING AT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE COST I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT INCREASED COSTS FOR. HARD SPORT COMMITMENTS ON THE FERTILIZER AND OTHER INPUTS CLASS SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL. STRAIN ON OUR SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FIGHTING HARASSMENT MINISTRATION TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE. IT HAS BEEN OPEN DIALOGUE IT HAS BEEN GREAT COOPERATION AND SEVERAL THAT OF THE MEASURES THAT WERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNED LAST FALL EXECUTIVE ORDER. NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. HAVE REAL BEEN FOCUSED WHAT ARE SOME SHORT TERM THINGS STATE DO TO HELP SUPPORT THE PROCESS. TO RELIEVE CONGESTION AMONG THOSE THINGS WERE WERE- ISSUING TEMPORARY PERMITS OVERWEIGHT TRUCKING PERMITS TO MOVE THESE CONTAINERS. WE DOUBLED THE COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE TESTING CAPACITY OBVIOUSLY WE NEED MORE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THOSE LICENSES THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT DMV DEATHS WITH LIGHT. AND THEY WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL STATE ON PROPERTIES THAT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR SHORT TERM. CARGO CONTAINER STORAGE NEEDS- THIS PART. HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT AS WE'VE IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON SINCE DECEMBER. AND THAT IS NORMALLY A NUMBER OF SHIPS WHAT WHAT TAKE CARGO OFF THAT LONG BEACH AND LA AND THEN SPEND AN EXTRA TWO DAYS TO COME UP TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND. THE PORT OF OAKLAND ACTUALLY HAS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THOSE JOBS ARE NOT COMING UP THE COAST ONE OF OUR FOCUS MESSAGES HAS BEEN TO. IS TO URGE THE SHIPPERS TO PLEASE BRING STEPS UP TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND WHERE ABOUT 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS FELL OUT. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT AND MONDAY OF THIS WEEK WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM USDA IN THE PORT OF OAKLAND. THEY'VE IDENTIFIED A TWENTY FIVE BAKER EIGHT YARD OFF TERMINAL THAT CAN BE USED AND EQUIPPED. FOR CONTAINER AND- OFFLOADING CONTAINERS AND CHASSIS IS TO MAKE THEM-AVAILABLE FOR RAPID RELOADING AND THE DEPLOYMENT TO THE PORT. THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP IN THE US IT SHOULD BE UP AND OPERATIONAL AND MARCH FIRST. IN ADDITION TO THAT USDA ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PAYMENTS. FOR EACH CONTAINER TO HELP DEFRAY THE ADDITIONAL COST OR AG EXPORTERS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE SHORT TERM THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IM GENES SIROCCO UP AFTER OUTLINED THE TREMENDOUS PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THESE CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE I'M EXCITED ABOUT ALL OF THEM BUT I'M ESPECIALLY EXCITED ABOUT. MAKING THE INVESTMENT TO FUTURE PROOF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WITH A IT'S A SUSTAINABLE. ITS MOVEMENT. TRAININGS AND IN CAL THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. ON ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ALREADY BEEN DISPATCHED. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE INLAND PORT THAT JEAN DISCUSSED IS ONE THAT CDFA CALTRANS AND COPIOUS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF LONG TERM VISIONS. THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORK ON TOGETHER WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS CURRENT DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ONLY BY WORKING TOGETHER AND I'M SO PLEASED TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE DEAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GIVING ME SOME TIME. THEY COULD CARE- SO THANK YOU- MUCH MADAM SECRETARY AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PREVIOUS TWO- THE PALEST- SECRETARY ROSS AND MR JACOB. MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DIRECT THIS QUESTION TO MISTER JACOB AND KIND OF JUST REFERRING BACK TO WHAT- MR SIROCCO ED SAID IS FAR AS INFORMATION SHARING YOU KNOW MENTIONING THAT WE'RE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND IN TRACKING CONTAINERS- YOU KNOW WOULDN'T WHEN WE BEGAN DEPLOYMENT IN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HOURS AT THE SPEAR HEAD OF THAT AND WE MOVED. INTO HIGHER ARMY. ACROSS IN WE TRACKED IN MOVEMENT OF EVERYTHING ARE ALL THE EQUIPMENT IN INTO THEATER IN AND BACK OUT. SO BEING HERE YEARS LATER LISTENING TO YOU KNOW WE CAN TRACK PIZZA BOXES BETTER THAN WE CAN TRACK CONTAINERS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY'S IS KIND OF FRUSTRATING- FOR MISTER JACOB HOW DO YOU SEE THE BEST METHOD. FOR GETTING THE COOPERATION TO SHARE THAT DATA OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE IN THE MILITARY WE HAVE YOU KNOW YOU GOT CLASS THREE YOU GOT CLASS TWO YOU GOT CLASS FOR. ON ON WHAT YOU'RE MOVING. WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO START DOING THAT DATA SHARE AND WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO WITHIN THE STATE LEGISLATOR. THE KIND OF HELP PUT SOME PRESSURE INTO THE MARKET TO DO THAT. YEAH THANK YOU AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND- ACTUALLY THAT- COMPARE AND CONTRAST TO- THE MILITARY IS A GOOD ONE- THE- WAY THAT THE INTERMODAL. SYSTEM WORKS INTERNATIONALLY IS THAT IT CREATES VALUE. THROUGH INTERMODAL ISM BUT WITHOUT CENTRAL CONTROL- SO ACROSS THE GLOBE YOU CAN USE THE SAME EQUIPMENT FOR ALL TYPES OF DIFFERENT THINGS ON ALL TYPE OF THE FOR MODES OF TRANSPORTATION SHIPS TRUCKS TRAINS- IN ANY COUNTRY. AND WITH JUST THE MAGIC OF AN INTERCHANGEABLE AND- YOU CAN HAVE CARGO GOING EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE AND IT'S NOT CENTRALIZED OBVIOUSLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF A CENTRALIZED MANAGED- SUPPLY CHAIN LIKE IN THE MILITARY. BUT THAT BEING SAID THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND- DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CARGO IS I THINK WHAT JIM WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS THE ABILITY TO INTERFACE AND BE TRANSPARENT. WITH END USERS AND- OTHER PARTIES INCLUDING THE STATE ANOTHER PUBLIC- ENTITIES AND SO THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT RIGHT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CARRIER- WHETHER IT BE AN OCEAN CARRIER RAIL CARRIER AND A MOTOR CARRIER THAT DOESN'T KNOW. WHICH BOXES CARRYING WHERE IT IS. AND HOW THAT GOING TO PROCEED THROUGH ITS PORTION OF THAT SUPPLY CHAIN UNDER A BILL OF LADING- THE QUESTION IS CAN THE THINGS BE COORDINATED- AND CAN THAT INFORMATION BE INTERCHANGED OUTSIDE THAT PROPRIETARY SPACE. AND SO I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT BUT WE'RE WORKING ON ONE IS- TO OF LA'S CREDIT MAY ALREADY DO HAVE TRANSPARENCY INTO A LOT OF THAT AND THEY PUBLISH IT AND AS JEAN SAID THAT A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION IN THERE- IN. THE PAST WE'VE HAD OURS SENSATION OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WE HAVE PADS SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF THESE- DATA. PUT TOGETHER UNDER OUR OWN PROPRIETARY AUSPICES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW OUR SITUATION TRACKS DO WELL TIME- BUT YOU KNOW A APA THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION WHICH TRACK NATIONAL TO USE STATISTICS THERE IS NOT A WAY TO ACTUALLY FORMALIZE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. IN ONE PLACE WHERE YOU SEE THE ALL AND NOT OPERATE. TRANSPARENT EITHER ALL- GET- PUT INTO IT CUMULATIVE- CLOSE TALK. DATA SHOW PLACE WHERE IF YOU FOR WHAT TOWN BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUTCOME ON A REAL TIME DAY- THAT VERY HARD TO DO BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS IS TO BE DISTRIBUTORS AND IT'S TO BE A NON CENTRALLY CONTROLLED NETWORK AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS PROPOSED- IN THE BUDGET NOW NOT SECTR RAFI- WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATED. ON IT BUT- THE PROPOSAL IN THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO. PREPARE FOR SOME ADDITIONAL DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE TO BE- DISCUSSED. IN THE FUTURE THERE'S NO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT LANGUAGE AT. BUT WE REPORT THAT WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO BEGIN TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND ON ARCHITECTURAL BASIS ON A PORT BY PORT LEVEL. SO EACH PORK AND START WORKING WITH ITS OWN- TERMINALS TO DUMB CARRIERS MOTOR CARRIERS RAIL CARRIERS AND OCEAN CARRIERS. TO START TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT. GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE SYSTEM- BUT IT IS HARD IT'S NOT CENTRALIZED. IT'S NOT. THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION IT'S MORE ABOUT MAKING INFORMATION AND A PLACE WHERE IT'S ACTIONABLE AND SUCH AN INCIDENT ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT TO PEOPLE WHO MAY BE MAKING DECISIONS- PHONE YOUR OPINION. I MEAN THAT. I'M NOT A BIG FAVOR THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES BUT BUT IF WE COULD HAVE A- CENTRAL LOT LIKE A. VOLUNTARY CENTRALIZED- GROUP WITHIN BILL. SO YOU GUYS CAN VOLUNTARY SENT THE INFORMATION IN REAL TIME. SO THAT WAY YOU KNOW FOLKS CAN GO ON L. A. R. R. AGRICULTURE SHIPPERS ARE MANUFACTURERS AND EVERYBODY CAN GO IN REAL TIME. IN IN KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS GOING BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING FOR. YOU KNOW ON THE BUSINESS AND IF YOU HAVE HIGH SCORED WITHIN A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM THAN PEOPLE KNOW THIS IS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE I WANT TO SHIP WITH VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT IN A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM SO THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A WAY FOR THE MARKET TO NATURALLY INCREASE THEIR RATINGS AND. EXACTLY RIGHT AT THE VALUE ADD THERE IS AS YOU DESCRIBED IT AND I THINK WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE NEXT PANEL OR PEOPLE THAT ARE FRUSTRATED. BY THE LACK OF ACTIONABLE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY. MOVE CARGO FASTER BETTER SMARTER AND LESS COST. SO WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPTY CONTAINERS SITTING ON CHATS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRIVATE TRUCKING ARTS IN ADDITION TO THE JAZZ MUSIC AND- EMPTY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FACILITATE ALL. TERMINALS BUT IT IS AN TRANSPARENT IN THE SYSTEM WHICH TRUCKING ARE THOSE THAT. ARE THOSE IN WHICH MOTOR CARRIERS HAVE THE ACCEPTABLE A QUICK MINUTE. HOW MUCH OF THAT EQUIPMENT IS ACTUALLY FOOD GRADE ARE WE WATCH WHICH CONTAINERS ARE REFRIGERATED. YOU KNOW AND THEN COORDINATING THOSE THINGS BACK WITH VETTEL SET THE FAILING SCHEDULES SO I AM PLEASED TO SAY AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE GET THE DIRECTOR ONE WE DO HAVE. CONGESTION AGAIN AT OAKLAND WE HAVE SEVENTEEN SHIPS WAITING TO GET IN THERE. BUT IT'S- VERY FRUSTRATING TO OUR CUSTOMERS IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL SAILING DATE IS BECAUSE THEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY CAN BRING THEIR CARGO INTO THE ACTUAL MARINE TERMINAL. WE DON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO JUST TAKE CARGO WHENEVER LIKE WE USED TO- WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WINDOWS. THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO EXPORTERS- WE UNDERSTAND IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN MANAGE LIMITED RESOURCE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- SO DATA TRANSPARENCY AND COORDINATION THAT RESPECT. FOR THE VALUE ADD TO OUR CUSTOMERS. NOT SOMETHING WON'T WORK. THAT'S THAT'S I'D LIKE TO SEE IS WHAT OF ALL. CENTRAL SYSTEM WOULD LOOK. THANK AND THE THEY GIVE US MATHIS SKIP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND DONNA WENT TO- THE PRESENTERS- THAT HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO- WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE UNDERSTAND- AND YOU GUYS HAVE ARTICULATED- PRECISELY THE PROBLEM BUT I ALSO WANT TO HEAR SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AND MR SOROKA HEY JEAN HOPE ALL IS WELL- EIGHTY THOUSAND SHORT EIGHTY THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS AND- FORTY THOUSAND WORKERS ETCETERA ETCETERA. HOW DO WE RECTIFY THAT HOW DO WE SOLVE THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES WITH THE PLAN THOUGH IT COULD BE IMPLEMENTABLE THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO SO FOR THE NEXT PRESENTERS AND THOSE WHO WILL BE PRESENTING AS WELL AS A SECRETARY PRECIADO- YOU KNOW MISS ROSS YOUR ARTICULATION BUT HOW WAS THE SOLUTIONS HONEST WE UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS BUT WHAT ARE THE SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS. THAT WE CAN NOTE AND THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THAT MR O'DONNELL SAID THAT YOU KNOW SEEK WAS A IS THE ISSUE THE HOBBIT WE BEGIN TO FEEL THAT- BANANA LAYER BY LAYER SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS SEEK WHAT IT IS IN FACT AN IMPEDIMENT. TO THE GOODS MOVEMENTS- OF THE STATE AND SO WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT AND LOOKING FOR A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT WITHOUT LACKS IN SOME OF OUR- ENVIRONMENTAL- ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE SO FAR BUT THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL TIED AND SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE LOOKING FOR AND NEEDS BUT HIS BODY TO ALSO GRASS SO THAT WE CAN CREATE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND MISSION IF THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION EXCELLENT QUESTION AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE HERE ON OF THE THIRD PANEL IS DEDICATED. TO SOLUTIONS IN FUTURE ISSUES AND SO OKAY THERE TIME IS OF THE- WERE HOUR FIFTEEN INTO THIS WE GOT FORTY FIVE MINUTES LEFT SO I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS- AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL. WHICH IS THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE- THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY- WHETHER THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF- PORT CONGESTION TO SPECIFIC OUR CULTURE INDUSTRIES LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO SPEAK WAS HERE IN PERSON I BELIEVE CRAIG- IS A DOER. OF VICE PRESIDENT GLOBAL SALES AND MARKETING- WITH- CAMPOS BROTHERS FARM VIBE IF- I PRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME I APOLOGIZE. THE PROBLEM. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY REGARDING- CULTURAL EXPORTS. AND ISSUE THAT CALIFORNIA PORTS SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO CALIFORNIA ALMONDS. MY NAME IS CRAIG DURING VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL SALES AND MARKETING AT CAMPUS BROTHERS FARMS LOCATED IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA. WE'RE FAMILY OWNED COMPANY AND GLOBAL SERVICE PROVIDER OPERATING SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WE WORK TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE OUR FARMING TECHNIQUES AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS. TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT CONSERVE PRECIOUS RESOURCES. AS AN ALMOND GROWER AND HANDLER WE ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN CROTHERS CALIFORNIA BY FAR. IT IS VERY DISCOURAGING TO US THE CALIFORNIA ALMOND INDUSTRY AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THAT OUR EXPORT SITUATION HAS NOT ONLY. NOT IMPROVED. BUT IT CONTINUES TO GET WORSE IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS CONTINUE TO BE DECIMATED. FOR CAMPUS BROTHERS FARM 70% OF OUR ALMOND CROP IS EXPORTED TO OVER SIXTY COUNTRIES INCLUDING JAPAN THE E. U. SOUTH KOREA INDIA CHINA AND THE E. UP IN THE UAE TO NAME A FEW. WITH EXPORTER FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS SO WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE COMPLEXITIES AROUND THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND EXPORT ISSUES. IN ADDITION I AM A PAST CHAIR OF THE SPECIALLY CROP TRADE COUNCIL AND CONTINUE TO SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OVERALL THE CALIFORNIA ALMANACS. ALMANACK SECTOR GENERATES OVER TWENTY ONE BILLION IN ECONOMIC REVENUE AND CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION TO THE STATE ECONOMYWHILE CREATING OVER ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA JOBS. ACCORDING TO CDFA ALMONDS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S TOP VALUED EAGER CULTURE EXPORT COMMODITY WITH A VALUE OF MORE THAN FOUR POINT NINE BILLION IN FOREIGN SALES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WITHOUT SUPPORT MARKET SO CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE AG EXPORT CLIMATE IS NOT LIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING OBSTACLES WELL BEYOND OUR USUAL CHALLENGES. ACCORDING TO THE RECENT YOU SEE- AB ECONOMICS ANALYSIS PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE U. S. AGRICULTURE USUALLY FILLS AND THAT ACCESS OR 40% OF ALL LOADED SHIPPING CONTAINERS LEAVING CALIFORNIA PORTS. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE TYPICALLY CARRY CALIFORNIA FARM PRODUCTS SHOWING HOW VITAL CONTAINERIZED SHIPPING IS TO OUR FARMERS. THE ECONOMICS ANALYSIS SHOWS THE SHARE OF EMPTY CONTAINERS LEAVING CALIFORNIA PORTS BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS IT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND HIT A RECORD 78% IN SEPTEMBER. THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE THOSE EMPTY CONTAINERS ARE NEEDED TO EXPORT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. PRE TWENTY TWENTY THE PERCENT OF EMPTIES WAS 30% ON AVERAGE. ACCESS TO EXPORT CONTAINERS EVEN MORE LIMITED GIVEN THE COSTS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN NEW FEES HAVE BEEN ADDED. THE CONGESTION AND EXTREME RATES AND FEES INCENTIVIZE THE SHIPPERS TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA PORTS WITH EMPTY CONTAINERS PARTICULARLY AVOIDING THE PORT OF OAKLAND ALTOGETHER WE'RE A GREAT DEAL OF OURPRODUCT IS EXPORTED FROM. THE NUMBER OF VESSELS CALLING O THE PORT OF OAKLAND HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME AVAILABLE TO IN GATE HAS GONE FROM AVERAGE THREE TO FIVE DAYS TO THIS LAST WEEK A VESSEL OPENED ONLY FOR FOUR HOURS THIS PAST WEEK FOR ENGAGING. THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMPLEX BASE TO OPERATE WITHIN. HOWEVER WE ARE VERY ALARMED AS OUR COSTS ARE SKYROCKETING WITH DETENTION AND DEMURRAGE CHARGES UP 3100% 60% OF OUR SHIPMENTS ARE BEING RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED COMPLETELY. WE HAVE SEVERAL CONTAINERS THE PAST TWO MONTHS WITH CONFIRM BOOKINGS THAT HAD NINE CHANGES TO THE LAST RECEIVING DATE OR THE AND GATE. ON AVERAGE WE INCURRED AN ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CONTAINER. THESE ARE CHARGES WE CANNOT PASS ON TO OUR CUSTOMER BUYER IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THE VESSEL DIDN'T PICK UP THE LOAD. AND IT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT OUR FAULT EITHER BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY ZERO RECOURSE WITH THE SHIPPING COMPANIES. FOR CALIFORNIA ALMONDS AT LEAST 20% OF OUR SALES COULD NOT BE COMPLETED BECAUSE OF OCEAN CARRIER PRACTICES. SUCH AS THE EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE BE TENSION TO DEMERGE CHARGES. OUTRAGEOUS FREIGHT RATES AND NOT COMMUNICATING WHICH WAS A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION ALREADY. IN A TIMELY MANNER. AS CHAIR RIVAS INDICATED BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY ONE THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS FROM CALIFORNIA PLUMMETED BY SEVENTEEN PERCENT. AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN LOSSES IN ADDITION TO THAT THE CALIFORNIA ALMOND INDUSTRY HAS SEEN MASSIVE PRICE DECLINE BECAUSE OF EXPORT SHIPMENTS NOT SHIPPING AS SCHEDULED. EQUAL TO ANOTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS MONEY LOST THIS WILL NOT FLOW INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. OUR INDUSTRY DEPENDS ON INTERNATIONAL HOLIDAYS AND WE CONTINUE TO MISS THE SHIPMENT WINDOW TO HIT THOSE CAUSING UPHEAVAL FOR CALIFORNIA ALMOND FARMING FAMILIES AND WE ARE NOW WHEN YOU'RE INTO A TIME OF HAVING EXTREME CARRY OUT LEVELS TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE OF MIS SHIPMENTS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. WE CANNOT BILL AN EXPORT CUSTOMER WITH WITHOUT HAVING A BILL OF LADING. CAN GET A BILL OF LADING UNTIL CONTAINERS LOADED ON A SHIP. SO EVERY TIME WE HAVE A VESSEL DELAYED IN CONTAINERS THAT ARE DELAYED FOR LOADING WHERE THIS THIS TRANSLATES INTO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BILLING THAT IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY OR EVEN CANCELLED. THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM FOR MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES. FURTHER GIVEN THE CONGESTION AND DELAYS ALL THROUGHOUT THE EXPORT SYSTEM THERE IS A MAJOR RISK OF PASSED IN DISEASE INFESTATION WHEN CONTAINER SIT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AT DESTINATION THAT CAN RUN INTO THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. OR OUTRIGHT REFUSAL OF THE PRODUCT BY THE BUYER. OUR COMBINED THE SITUATION IS UNTENABLE. ACCORDING TO THE CATO INSTITUTE. MANY OF THE PROBLEMS AT US PORTS RESULT FROM INTENTIONAL DECISIONS MADE YEARS AGO. DECISIONS BECAUSE IN OUR PORT SYSTEM TO BADLY LAKE MUCH OF THE WORLD. THE TWENTY TWENTY WORLD BANK H. S. MARKET CONTAINER PORT PERFORMANCE INDEX. SHOWS THAT NOT ONE U. S. PORT RANKS IN THE TOP FIFTY GLOBAL PORTS IN TERMS-OF GETTING A SHIP IN AND OUT OF THE PORT. OAKLAND ACTUALLY CAME IN THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SECONDS. LA LONG BEACH RATE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT AND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THIRD RESPECTIVELY. YES FOR SOLUTIONS ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WE SUPPORT A LIMIT. A LIMIT ON THE PERCENTAGE OF EMPTY STUDY VASILIS ALLOWED TO CARRY WHEN DEPARTING THE WEST COAST PORTS. VESSELS NEED TO BE REQUIRED TO CALL ON THE PORT OF OAKLAND AS OPPOSED TO SKIPPING THE PORT AS SCHEDULED. FURTHER LEGISLATION IS BEING CONSIDERED IN CONGRESS TO ESTABLISH REASONABLE AND FAIR OCEAN CARRIER PRACTICES CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION'S. CURRENTLY ON IN FORCE IMPERATIVE ROLAND A BREACH IN DETENTION. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THE SAME HERE IN THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE EVEN HANDED OCEAN CARRIER PRACTICES WE BELIEVE THERE ARE STEPS TAT CAN BE TAKEN TO MOTORIZED MODERNIZE LONG CALIFORNIA AND WE HOPE LEGISLATORS WILL CONSIDER ACTION TO PARTICULARLY ADDRESS. THE INFLATED AN UNFAIR FEES I KNOW THERE'S WORK UNDERWAY TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES BY THE FEDERAL STATE OFFICIALS AS WELL AS THE PORTS AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. HOWEVER WE ARE STRONGLY FEELING THE IMPACTS AS WE SPEAK AND HONESTLY THE CORRECTIONS CANNOT HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY TESTIMONY TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU FOR. THAT TESTIMONY WE'RE GONNA MOVE NEXT TO THE SECOND- THE PANELISTS I'LL ASK MEMBERS TO HOLD THE QUESTIONS AND TELL ALL OF- THE PANEL SPEAK. OF WILL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY IT'S A MICHAEL PARR VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL SALES OF LENTI FAMILY ESTATES. MISTER PARKER WITH US. I AM YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. VERY GOOD. GERMAN RIVAS CHAIRMAN DONALD THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL SHOULD COULD. THAT HAVE I'M CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS AROUND THE WORLD. MY NAME IS MICHAEL PART I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR WENDY FAMILIES STATES. LOCATED IN LIVERMORE VALLEY IN EAST BAY HEARING STEPHENS JUST GO. TWENTY THE OLDEST FAMILY OWNED WINERY IN AMERICA FIVE GENERATIONS. ALL FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BONDED WINERIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN HE IS THE THIRTIETH LARGEST WINERY GET THE TEN TENTH LARGEST EXPORTER OF PREMIUM WINES AROUND THE WORLD WE HAVE SUPPORT ACROSS THE 25% OF OUR ENTIRE PRODUCTION TO OVER SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES. WITH EXPORT. VALUE POSSIBLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS. BEFORE TALK ABOUT YOU. OF THE GLOBAL SHIPPING. ON CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS LET ME FIRST TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WINE INSTITUTE THE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY HAS FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE ECONOMIC IMPACT. IT ALSO HAS A ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN BILLION. ARE IMPACTED NATIONAL THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. THIS IS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND TWICE THAT NATIONWIDE. THE CONTRIBUTES SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE WAGES AND PAYS FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA EXPORTED ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ONE GLOBALLY. AS WITH SO MANY BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS HAS LED TO RISING COSTS AND LONG DELAYS IN GETTING WIND WORK EXPORT MARKETS. WHAT IMPACT THESE TWO WERE FACTORS HOWEVER WHY BUSINESS OVERSEAS. RISING SHIPPING COSTS ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RETAIL PRICES ARE EXPORT MARKETS. IN ORDER TO OFFSET GLOBAL FREIGHT RATES THAT ARE UP SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THIS TIME LAST YEAR OUR REPORTERS RAISING PRICES TO THEIR RETAILERS AND RESTAURANT CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT WE ARE BEGINNING TO LOSE MARKET SHARE TO INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE NOT FACING THESE EXTRA COSTS. RICH SPANISH ITALIAN AND AUSTRALIAN WINES ARE COUNTING ON THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES. BINDING THE- DELAYS IN GETTING OUR WANTS TO EXPORT MARKETS ARE RAMPANT WHAT USED TO TAKE ONE TO TWO WEEKS TO PROCESS A WIDE ORDER GET PICKED UP FOR SHIPMENT IS NOW TAKING THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. WHETHER THE BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS. OR SECURING SPACE ON VESSEL IT IS A RESULT IN THOUSANDS OF CASES THE LINES THAT ARE SITTING IN OUR WINERY WAREHOUSE AT THIS VERY MOMENT INSTEAD OF BEING ON ROUTE TO INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS. THESE DELAYS IN SHIPMENTS B. TO STOCK OUT SITUATIONS ON WORLDWIDE RETAILER SHELVES RESTAURANT WANTED LISTS. THOSE RETAILERS AND RESTAURANTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRONGER WINDS NOW WE'RE SELLING SOMETHING ELSE ONCE YOU LOSE A PLACEMENT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET BACK. RECENT SHIPMENT ARE ALSO CALL LOSS SALES OPPORTUNITY HIS KEY. CALIFORNIA Y. PROMOTION DUE TO LACK OF INVENTORY. THE WINDS WERE ORDERED SIX MONTHS AGO AND IT'S STILL NOT ARRIVED. THIS PROMOTION WAS TO BE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA WINE INSTITUTE AND REPRESENTS LOST VALUE OF SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ONLY ONE LOSS SALES OPPORTUNITY WITH ONE RETAILER IN ONE COUNTRY. IN DISSIPATED SHIPMENT DELAYS ARE ALSO CHANGING THE WAY OUR IMPORTERS ARE WARMING WINDS. MANY OF THEM HAVE CHANGED THEIR EFFICIENT ORDERING PROCESS FROM JUST IN TIME TO JUST IN CASE. WITH LOOMING UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET THEIR HANDS ON THE WINES THESE OF ARE OVER ORDERING. IN ANTICIPATION OF NOT RECEIVING THE STOCKS WHEN THEY NEED THE- SIMILAR TO THE PANTRY LOADING MENTALITY THAT INFLUENCED HOUSEHOLDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL PREPARED TO WEATHER UNEXPECTED EVENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS OUR OWN INVENTORY LEVELS AT THE WINERY HAVE BECOME DANGEROUSLY LOW. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL CUSTOMERS YOU ARE LOW ON INVENTORY WHEN THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CASES OF WINE SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE WAITING FOR PICK UP BY FREE FORWARD. READ DELAYS AND RISING COSTS ARE NOT THE ONLY. FACTOR AFFECTING ADULT ONE AFFECTING OUTBOUND SHIPMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. THE ALSO AFFECTED PRODUCTION E. END OF THE ONE BUSINESS. EXTRA COSTS AN EXTENDED LEAD TIMES ALL MATERIALS HAVE GONE UP WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL BEGIN BOTTLING OR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE VINTAGE WINES. WINERIES ARE DESPERATE TO SECURE ORDERS FOR GLASS LABELS COURTS IN CARDBOARD. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERIES OF THESE COMPONENTS CAN THROW OFF BOTTLING TIMELINES FOR THOSE WINERIES THAT NEED TO OUTSOURCE BOTTLING LINES THIS CRUCIAL IN CANCELLATION FEES WERE PAID IN PRIOR PRICES TO SECURE A GUARANTEE BOTTLING DATE SHIPMENTS RESULT IN LOST REVENUES WHEN HE COULD HAVE SHIPPED PERCENT MORE WIND IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IF WE COULD HAVE SECURED THE FREIGHT PICKUP ASSIGNMENTS. IN CONCLUSION IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY COULD FACE LONG TERM EXPORT MARKET SHARE DECLINE. IN REDUCE REVENUES THAT FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS SO MUCH OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE IN SACRAMENTO WILL AFFECT FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BONDED WINERIES IN THE FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED GRAPE GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PAR- APPRECIATE THAT TESTIMONY- AND FINALLY THE- FINAL SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL DESCRIPTION IS CHRIS CRUTCHFIELD CEO OF AMERICAN COMMODITY COMPANY. I BELIEVE HE IS HERE IN PERSON. WELCOME TO SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BONTA BOTH OF THE CHAIRMAN AND- ALL OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY AS A GERMAN MENTION- MY NAME IS CHRIS CARTWHEELS I'M CEO OF- ECC RICE- MILLING AND EXPORTING COMPANY ON OUT OF COLUSA COUNTY COMPANY I ALSO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION IN THE USA RICE MILLERS ASSOCIATION THE USA RICE FEDERATION. AND I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED TO THE NEWLY CREATED FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION'S NATIONAL SHIPPER ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I WEAR CONTACTS THE CALIFORNIA RICE INDUSTRY PRODUCES RICE ON ABOUT HALF A MILLION ACRES- RIGHT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALUE. VALLEY TRANSLATING INTO NEARLY TWO MILLION METRIC TONS OF RICE- FURTHER I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT POUNDS HERE TODAY SO. JUST TO PUT THAT A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE. I JUST OVER FORTY BILLION POUNDS OF RICE- IMITA EXPORTED ABOUT COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. ANYWHERE WHEN YOU TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE U. S. AND YOU CONSUME SUSHI- AND YOU'RE NOT IN NORTHEAST ASIA YOU'RE PROBABLY EATING RICE GROWN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE EXPORTS ARE FACILITATED THROUGH THREE POINT THREE PORTS- STOCKTON WEST SACRAMENTO. AND OAKLAND. OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AT ALL THREE OF THESE FACILITIES THE EFFECTS OF THIS CRISIS ARE SIGNIFICANT. NOT JUST FOR MILLS LIKE MINE AND THE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED. BUT ALSO WITH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL GROWER- LET ME GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE FOR MY COMPANY AND SEVERAL OF MY OTHER MALE COLLEAGUES IN HERE IN THE STATE. THE HIGHEST VALUE RICE WE EXPORT. ISN'T BRANDED RETAIL WHOLESALE AND FOODSERVICE BAGS. TO MARKETS OF SOUTH KOREA JAPAN. AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND IT'S ALL SHIPPED IN CONTAINERS. THEN IT GOES OUT IN PACKAGES LIKE THESE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE ON THESE PACKAGES ONE THING YOU PROBABLY DO RECOGNIZES CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF THE SHIPPING CRISIS HOWEVER THIS ALL OF THIS BUSINESS IS DRIED UP. CURRENTLY OUR INDUSTRY. DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLOG OF CONTAINERS. SOMERS DUE TO THE NEAR IMPOSSIBILITY OF SECURING BOOKINGS. AND WHEN WE DO WE ARE TAGGED WITH EXCESSIVE DIVERGENT DETENTION FEES. REYES BOUND FOR THESE MARKETS IS NOW SHIPPED OUT OF THE IMPORTS OF WEST SACRAMENTO AND STOCKTON IN TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POUND JUNIOR TOOK BAGS. UNBRANDED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH NO DIRECT ACCESS TO OUR CONSUMERS. AFTER DECADES OF EFFORT AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROMOTING BRANDED CALIFORNIA RICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN CHAPTER IN JAPAN IN IN SOUTH KOREA. THEY NOW CANNOT FIND AN EASILY IDENTIFIABLE PACKAGE PRICE FROM THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY EXPORT TO ASIA ALBEIT AND BOOK BAGS AND ON MARCH BUT MORE CHIPS CONVERSELY OUR INDUSTRY HAS LOST MORE THAN 80% OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND METRIC TONNE MARKET. THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA. BECAUSE THESE MARKETS CAN ONLY RECEIVE CONTAINERIZED SHIPMENTS THEY'RE NOT. THEIR PORTS ARE NOT SET UP TO RECEIVE. TWELVE FIFTEEN TWENTY THOUSAND TONE BOTH PRICE SHIPMENTS. CALIFORNIA RICE IN THESE MARKETS HAS LARGELY BEEN REPLACED BY CHINESE AND RUSSIAN RICE. THE LOSS OF MARKETS AND CONVERSION FROM CONSUMER TO BOTH PACKAGES RESULTS IN MUCH LOWER PRICES AND AS A HUGE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON OUR ENTIRE INDUSTRY. WE ESTIMATE THAT. MORE THAN NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF VALUE HAS ALREADY BEEN STRIPPED FROM OUR INDUSTRY JUST THIS CROP YEAR WHICH IS ONLY THREE AND A HALF MONTHS ALL. THIS WAS NOT ONLY IMPACTS MY MIL AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I CAN THE PULLEY. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE PARKING PACKAGE LIKE THIS A TWO POUND BAG TAKES QUITE A FEW MORE PEOPLE TEND TO RUN THE OPERATE THEN THE OPERATOR TO RUN THE AUTO LOADER FOR A TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POUND JUMBO TOTE BAG. IT ALSO TRANSLATES DIRECTLY INTO LOWER PRICES FOR FARMERS ARE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILY FARMERS. THAT THEY GET FOR THEIR CROP. FINALLY I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE SHIPPING OUT OF THE INLAND PORTS HAS BECOME MORE CONGESTED AND MORE EXPENSIVE AS MAJOR IMPORTERS INCLUDING WALMART AND COSTCO ARE SHIFTING THEIR IMPORT CARGO OUT OF THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH AN INTERIM IN. INLAND PORTS. INCLUDING IMPORTING RICE FAMILY FARMERS HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THERE ARE ACTIONS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE OCEAN CARRIERS TO EXPORT CONTAINERS FILLED WITH CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS RATHER THAN SIMPLY SENDING THEM BACK TO ASIA EMPTY. WE ALSO SUPPORT ALL EFFORTS TO PROHIBIT THOSE SAME CARRIERS FROM CHARGING EXPORTERS FOR DELAYS AND RESCHEDULING OF DELIVERIES NOT CAUSED BY THE EXPORTER. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF JUST HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS BEGUN TO SHIPPING CONTAINERS JUST LAST YEAR IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE MY COMPANY WAS PAYING ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A TWENTY FOOT CONTAINER. TO GO FROM OAKLAND TO AQABA JORDAN THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ROUTES NOT ONLY FOR MY COMPANY BUT NOT FOR MANY CALIFORNIA RICE MILLS. JORDAN IMPORTS OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS OF CALIFORNIA RICE EVERY YEAR. TODAY THAT SAME ROUTE. A CONTAINER COST FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE EXCESSIVE DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION FEES WHICH ARE ALWAYS CARDS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE MOMENT- SITUATION MENTIONED- THESE WINDOWS THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER. CAN GET DOWN TO FOUR HOURS THAT CAN BE A LIVE LOAD. THAT IS GOING DOWN TO OAKLAND FROM MY MAIL IN MY TEAM IS INFORMED WHILE THE CONTAINERS ON THE ROAD THAT NOT ONLY IS THE ENGAGE. NOT TOMORROW. THE END DATE DEADLINE IS THREE O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON. WELL IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN DOWN TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND YOU CAN'T WAIT IN LINE IN THREE HOURS HI AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T HIT A WINDOW LIKE THAT. THESE FEES ARE CONTROLLABLE IN THE END SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK INTO LINE WITH HISTORIC LEVELS. IN THE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR OCEAN CARRIERS AND AN INDUSTRY. THAT IS SEEING ALL TIME RECORD HIGH PROFIT MARGINS. SECONDLY WE STRONGLY CONDEMN TROLLING COURAGE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR PORTS. FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE FAR BEHIND THOSE OF ASIA. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE REST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD. WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO REFLECT REMAIN COMPETITIVE LONG AFTER THIS CURRENT CRISIS IS BEHIND US. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS VERY ENCOURAGING. TO ME TO SEE THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS ENGAGING IN LEADERSHIP ON AN ISSUE THAT IS UNTIL RECENTLY HAS FRANKLY BEEN INVISIBLE. WHILE PORTS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS HAVE CERTAINLY COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE REALITY IS THIS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN AILING FOR A LONG WHILE. IT IS HIGH TIME TO GET IT HEALTHY FOR THE BENEFIT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CRUTCHFIELD AND NOW WE HAVE- QUESTION COMMENT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE APPLE WATCH THIS JUST A COMET- I WAS WELL I THINK THE BODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. AND LISTENING TWO I WANT TO THANK MR GIVES AS IT AS THE LEAVES OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS FIX RIGHT BUT YOU HEARD THE FRUSTRATION THAT AS THE SPEAKERS. IT'S SCARY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SIT HERE AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS. DAHLE WE DON'T JUST FEED- THIS STATE OR THIS COUNTRY REPEAT THIS WORLD AND I'M HEARING MORE MORE OF FARMERS GOING IT'S USUALLY BEEN GENERATIONAL RIGHT NOT THEN IT IS A MYTH THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT FARMERS ARE RICH RIGHT AND I HATE HEARING THAT BECAUSE I'M FROM AG COMMUNITY I THINK I SEE IT HERE. WHAT THEY DO I'M HEARING MORE MORE OF THE FAT OF THE KIDS SAYING I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO WHAT MY PARENTS DID IT'S TOUGH. AND I'M JUST THANKFUL FOR YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I HEAR IT IN YOUR GUISES VOICE I HEAR THE FRUSTRATION. AND IT'S SCARY AND SCARY FOR OUR ECONOMY. LAST YEAR THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR THE STATE BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A DOMINO EFFECT. YOU KNOW AND THAT DOMINO EFFECT WORK IT'S GOING TO PAY BACK WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE HOLE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION AND A FIX AND A QUICK FIX. BECAUSE WHAT THE ACTIVITY DOES. IS NOT JUST FOR. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT'S FOR EVERYONE AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING UP HERE AND LET IN OUR BODY HERE TO HEAR YOUR FRUSTRATION. THANK YOU. THANK U. S. NUMBER AND THEY CAN. HM THANK YOU SEVEN NUMBER- MAJORITY LEADER RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THAT WAS THE WORD THAT KEPT COMING THROUGH IS I HEARD YOUR TESTIMONY IS THE FRUSTRATION IT'S REAL ALSO FROM THE PANELISTS ON ON THE TV IT'S IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MORE. WEEK IT'S PALPABLE THE FRUSTRATION IS PALPABLE AND I THINK THAT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE HEAR IT OFTEN FROM OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MORE INVOLVED IN THIS I'M INLAND. AND I AM INVOLVED WITH THE LOGISTICS ASPECT OF IT BUT TO HEAR FROM OUR COLLEAGUES REGARDING THEIR FRUSTRATION. NOW TO HAVE IT. HAVE YOU SPEAK ABOUT IT AND IT SO ELOQUENTLY AND SO. IN SUCH A RAW WAY- IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO HEAR AND I AGREE WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA PUT THE WHAT THAT THIS THIS WAS IMPORTANT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO BE HERE. I THINK THAT IT'S WOOD ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR TO ME IS THAT AS WE LOOK FOR A SOLUTION. YOU ALL HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE IT ISN'T A SOLUTION IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY A BUNCH OF POLITICIANS- OF SITTING BEHIND A DESK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. IT'S GOING TO BE TO ENGAGE THOSE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE IN THE EARLIER- PRESENTATION BY MR SIROCCO THE ONE THING THAT THE AND ITS BEEN BROUGHT UP A NUMBER OF TIMES IS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. DIGITALIZATION THE FACT THAT WE ARE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND OTHER NATIONS IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME QUITE FRANKLY. ARE WE ARE SO AHEAD. IN SO MANY WAYS BUT TO KNOW THAT THAT WE ARE THIRTY YEARS BEHIND OTHER OTHER NATIONS. IS AS UNACCEPTABLE- BUT WE NOW SEE THE EFFECTS OF BEING SO FAR BEHIND. IT THEN I AYE DADDY SINCERELY APPRECIATE. THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO COME HERE TO PRESENTED TO US THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM MAJORITY LEADER- AND SO WITH THAT WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE PRESSED FOR TIME IS A ONE TO GET TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF.

ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS KAPPA. AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF OAKLAND HOLY JOINING US REMOTELY TO DISCUSS WITH THE PORT IS DONE TO EASE CONGESTION. THIS PANELS ENTITLED SOLUTIONS AND FUTURE ISSUES. SEMESTER ONE WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED PLEASE. SORT OF GRAPHIC I REPRESENTATION OF WHAT OPEN AND WHY BECAUSE I WANTED TO. PAY ATTENTION TO THE OPERATOR WHERE MICE CLOSER IS THAT DEEP YELLOW SPACE OF THE TERMINAL IN THE PORT OF OAKLAND. OF SECRETARY ROSS IN THE INDUSTRY I REPRESENT AS I'VE MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA PORTS. HANI MODERNIZING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND I POINT THIS OUT BECAUSE THAT GOES SPACE RIGHT THERE RIGHT NOW COULD BE A PORT TERMINAL BUT IT'S NOT WHY BECAUSE IT'S NOT PAID WE'VE HAD NOT ECONOMY INVESTMENT WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT SPACE BUT CONTAINERS TOWARDS FOR TOMORROW OPERATIONS. AND WE DON'T I WILL TALK ABOUT THE LAST AS CUT IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW FOR EXPORTERS. WE HAVE SPACE HERE THAT IS NOT MODERNIZE IN IT IS. TO BE PORTABLE SPACE CURRENTLY S. CERTAINLY ARE THE BEST MEN'S THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MAKING THE PORTS IS GOING TO HELP US CATCH UP. I JUST WANT TO POINT AS TO WHY OUR PORTS ARE STILL BEHIND IN TERMS OF OUR INVESTMENT INFRASTRUCTURE HERE CALIFORNIA. WE HAD NOT HEARD OF THE ABOUT- WHY THE- ACTOR ARE HAVING ISSUES AND ESPECIALLY WITH PORTAL. IT'S NOT GIVE YOU IS- TO UP THE AT ONE THAT SERVICE FOR EXPORTERS THAT PORT. I HERE IS THAT YOU RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AS OF RIGHT NOW RIVERSIDE BROTHER SEVEN VESSELS BERTH. AT EIGHT ANCHOR SIX DRIFTING HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT QUITE- GIVE THE EXPORT I CAUGHT EXPORTERS ANY COMFORT SHE WAS WAITING OUT AT THE AT THE BANK BECAUSE WHY A LOT OF THAT IS THE IMPORTS LARA'S BAPTIST BASEBALL EXPORTERS ON THOSE SHIPS AS THEY GO OUT- WE HAD- AND PART OF THE ISSUE AS MENTIONED BEFORE IS EIGHT OF OUR TWENTY FIVE HISTORICAL WEEKLY SERVICES ARE NOT BYPASSING OPEN. DUE TO THE FACTORS THAT THAT MANY OF OUR SPEAKERS BEFORE ME SO I SPOKE UP- WE HAVE SIXTY TWO BATTLE CALLS IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE VERSUS NINETY FOUR ID TWENTY. TWENTY- D. TWENTY TWO. SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT THAT YOU HAVE A EXPORTS. WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT ARE EXPLORED. PARTNERS I SAID TO CALL THE OAK PORTABLE OAKLAND IS ABOUT FOUR FOUR FOR AGRICULTURE EXPORTER FOR LARGE SEGMENTS OF OUR EXPORT COMMITTEE AT COMMUNITY YES AS WE COMPARED DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE VERSUS DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH THE PORT OF OAKLAND. WE SEE THE REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME. I THOSE ARE SIGN FINAL THE PERSON. TRY NOT MUCH AS THIRTY FIVE EIGHT MONTHS THIRTY FIVE AND YOU HEARD FROM THE RICE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE. YEAH THEY HAVE THE REDUCTION IN EXPORTING RICE OF 73% TO A PORTABLE- THAT IS A FIGURE THAT IS. TRANSLATING TO THE IMPACT OF YOU HEARD INTERESTED ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS LOSSES THAT ARE SUFFERING. NEXMO OVERALL THE TOP AB KAMANI VOLUMES DOWN SIX. YEAR OVER YEAR TWENTY ONE VERSUS TWENTY. THE LAST WILL APPOINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS VERY CALIFORNIA. CENTRIC CONCERN HERE.BUT YOU'VE ALSO HEARD FIGURES IF YOU LOOK AT NATIONWIDE. ADD EXPERT ACTUALLY HAVE GONE UP. IT'S GOING TO PANDEMIC. YET EXPORTS TO CALIFORNIA'S GOING DOWN. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A PARADOX TO US BUT NOT SO MUCH IF YOU CONSIDER THAT CALIFORNIA'S A WHOLE IS LOOKING LOSING EXPORT MARKET SHARE. IN OTHER WORDS AG EXPORTS GOING TO CALIFORNIA PORTS OF GOING DOWN. WHILE THE VOLUME TO EAST COAST PORT GATES WAYS ARE GOING UP AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY EXPORTS GOING UP EVEN THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE LOSING THAT MARKET SHARE THAT CERTAINLY IS A CONCERN TO EXPORT COMMITTEE. YEAH COMMITTEE BUT AS WELL I THINK AS CALIFORNIA AND- THIS LEGISLATURE WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHY WE'RE HAVING THAT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT. SECRETARY ROSS AND I GIVE A LOT OF THINGS TO HER AND ALSO BILL BIZ DIRECTION MYERS IS ALWAYS CAL STUDY TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT FOR HELPING US GET TO WHERE WE ARE. AS MENTIONED BEFORE ON MONDAY THE USDA AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED AND PROGRAM AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IN WHICH WE ARE NOW LAYING DOWN A TEMPORARY A CONTAINER STORAGE AND PARKING SPACE TWENTY TWO ACRES. HOW DOES THAT HELP THEY REALLY RELIEVES THESE SORT OF EMPTY CONTAINERS PARKED ON TERMINALS TO RELIEVE THE OVERCROWDING SO IT MAKES MORE SPACE. FOR EXPORTERS TO GO GET THEIR CONTAINERS CONTAINERS. SO HEY GET HAVE CONTAINERS FOR THEIR COMMODITY EXPORTS. AT THIS FACILITY TRYING TO FIND TWO ACRES. MAN POOR ONLY WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED FORTY REFRIGERATED CONTAINER PLUGS FOR THOSE REFRIGERATED AND CHILLED PRODUCTS GOING TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A OPERATOR THE COST OF THIS TO THE CONTAINER TO USE IT IS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CONTAINER WE ESTIMATE. HOWEVER THE USDA HAS COMMENTED SAID- THOSE EXPORT AG EXPORTERS WANTED TO USE YARD CAN GET THAT REIMBURSED ARE INCENTIVIZED TO THE TO THE USDA A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CONTAINER. SO IN OTHER WORDS ARE REIMBURSING ANY COSTS USES CONTAINER SPACE THIS IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PORT OF OAKLAND. AND ACCORDING TO THE PRESS RELEASE BY USDA THIS MAY SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER POINTS AS WELL AND AGAIN WE THANK THE US SECRETARY ROSS AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES WHILE. HAVING COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT THE OTHER FEDERAL PARTNERS ARE ENGAGING THEM. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM THERE'S NO APPOINTMENTS REQUIRED MULTIPLE COACHING CARRIERS EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE THERE IT'S AVAILABLE TO ALL AREAS NOT ANY SINGLE TERMINAL CARRIER. UP FASTER TRUCK TURN TIMES MORE FLEXIBILITY. ONE VESSEL SCHEDULES CHANGE. AND ALSO WE ARE POOREST BUT INCENTIVE TO AGRA EXPORTERS. I ONGOING NEEDS WE NEED MAINTAIN THE CARGO REESE WHEN IS THAT A FORM WE NEED TO GO. WHEN THEY HAVE WEEKS TO GET THIS IN A OFFICE. WE TRY TO BUILD SPACE ON I HOPE AS CALLS TO EXPORT CARGO THIS IS A PARTICULAR. WHEN THERE ARE SCHEDULED SHIPPING VESSELS COMING INTO THE PORT ANNOUNCED SO THAT EXPORTERS DON'T EVEN GET THE NEWS THAT THERE IS A SPACE AVAILABLE AND THEY JUST TURN AROUND AND TO ACT ALTHOUGH THE IMPORTS AND GO BACK TO ASIA. WE NEED TO HAVE. RETURN TO THE OAK SIR ROUTES. THE SHIPPING LINES. TO PARTICULARLY SOUTH. EAST ASIA WHERE A LOT OF THE EXPORTS ARE NOW HAVING NO SPACE ON THE SHIPPING LINES. ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE STATE AS I MENTIONED VERY OF UP FRONT. WHAT THE MATH WE NEED FUNDING FOR MODERNIZING ALL PORTS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT WE UTILIZE. MAXIMIZE YOU ARE UTILITY OF OUR OF OUR CAPACITY AT THE PORTS AND ALSO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. SO WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S JOHNNY BUDGET BLUEPRINT WHICH SUPPLIES THAT MONEY THAT YOU LIST THE HERE THAT WE HOPE TO- WE'LL USE SUFFICIENTLY TO MODERNIZE OUR PORTS AS MENTIONED MANY TIMES. THE TRICORDER HENCE MY PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AS MENTIONED BEFORE SO I WON'T BELABOR THAT. LASTED LATE REPORT PRIORITIES WE NEED TO HAVE MAGICAL CAPACITY IN RENEWABLE ENERGY RESILIENCY INITIATIVES TO REALLY GROWING UP PORTS NOT ONLY JUST TO MAKE IT LAST ADMISSION. OF PARTICULAR MATTER MISSION ALSO MORE ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY BUT YOU MAKE IT MOVE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND AGAIN WE NEED TO MODERNIZE I'M MERENBERG TERMINALS AND WAREHOUSING FACILITIES. TO SERVE OUR EXPORT COMMUNITIES. I THINK TOWARD MEN BECAUSE THE NEXT SPEAKER AND THE REV US. IS HERE THAT ARE THERE ARE. FOR LIKE PORTLAND AT THE OAKLAND AND STOCKTON TO REALLY FIND PARTNERSHIPS TO OFFER MORE CHOICES MODALITIES AND ALSO INLAND PORT POSSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND PUT A STOP TO. IT WAS A KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE NEED TO BUILD AS WE GO FORTH FOR SOLUTIONS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME AND I WILL- YOU KNOW THE TIME OF YOUR THE FLOOR NOW THANK YOU CHAIR. FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER OUT WHEN AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN FOCUSING ON SOLUTIONS IN FUTURE ISSUES A SECOND- THE PANELISTS HERE WITH US IN PERSON IS THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. FEDERATION JAMIE JOHANNSON- JAMIE IS ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU AND- IT'S ALL YOURS. THANK YOU AT OR EVEN AND THANK YOU- CHAIR O'DONNELL AND THE REST OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE FOR TAKING A SAUNA JIM JOHANNSON PRESS THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. I'M ALSO A FARMER AND BUTTE COUNTY FARMING OLIVE AND CITRUS. AMONG THE MANY PROBLEMS HE HAD IN THIS IS TO YOU SEE A TRIPLE WHAMMY BUT NOW WITH EXPORTS IN THE KOBE AND STILL RECOVERING FROM THAT OF COURSE DROUGHT AND THEN OF COURSE THE TRADE WAR. I MEAN IT'S BECAUSE BEFORE ME HAVE COVERED IT SO I'LL BE BRIEF I KNOW YOU'RE RUNNING ON SHORT ON TIME. BUT I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS- JUST IN CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE FACING HERE CALIFORNIA FARMERS LOST TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORT SALES- BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER. YOU MAY REMEMBER- MEDIA COVERAGE ON A CHINESE THAT THE CHINA TRADE WAR. IN WHICH AGRICULTURE AT THAT TIME ONLY LOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO THIS IS IT'S CATASTROPHIC FOR MANY OF OUR MEMBERS. LET ME FOCUS. ON SOME SOLUTIONS PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. WHERE THANK CHAIRMAN RIVAS ON A BILL BIGGEST ONE INCREASING- GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHTS FOR TRUCKS BILL THROUGH IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH TO GET IT TO EIGHTY THOUSAND WE THANK THE GOVERNOR WHO UNTIL JUNE NOW- DOES HAVE EIGHTY THOUSAND BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT- SHE'S ME THAT- THE- WASHINGTON OREGON OF INCREASED TRUCK WEIGHTS TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS. WE'RE WORKING WITH CONGRESSMAN COSTA THE BIPARTISAN GROUP TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THEIR WEIGHTS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE IN RESPONSE TO KOBE NINETEEN PROVISION IN THE CARES ACT ALLOWED STATES TO ISSUE PERMITS. ALLOWING TRUCKS TO OPERATE ABOVE FEDERAL WEIGHT LIMITS ON INTERSTATES WAIVERS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS DURING THIS TIME ONE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS VEHICLE CAPACITY. BY AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY SEVEN HER MILES PER SHIP. THIS REDUCE SHIPMENTS BY SIX HUNDRED MILES. OURS MIGHT REDUCE SHIPMENT BY SIX HUNDRED MILES TRAVELED BY FIFTY ONE THOUSAND MILES. AND REDUCE CO TWO EMISSIONS BY A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. THOUSAND POUNDS. ALSO AS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THE RECENT USDA ANNOUNCEMENT IN HELPING- AT THE OAKLAND PORTS WITH FUNDING CAN WE CONTINUE TO GIVE ACT PREFERRED ACCESS APORTES THIS TWENTY FIVE ACRE SITE IN OAKLAND IS SET TO OPEN IN MARCH- TWENTY TWENTY TO THE SITE WILL PROVIDE THE SITE UNLOAD. TO LOAD CURRENTLY EMPTY CONTAINERS USDA HAS AGREED TO SUBSIDIZE 60% OF THE START UP COSTS AND PARTNER WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND TO PARTIALLY COVER THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PER CONTAINER REIMBURSEMENT A MAJOR SHIPPERS AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MENTIONED- INLAND LOAD POINTS- CAN WE FIND AN ESTABLISHED. INLAND LOAD POINTS ON THE WEST COAST WHICH IS IN BAKERSFIELD AND WEALTHY WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED WILL AMIT VALLEY. CAN WE IDENTIFY AND FUND THOSE PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY APPLIED FOR FUNDS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. CAN WE EXPAND WEST COAST WEST COAST PORT INFRASTRUCTURE. EXPEDITE STATE AND LOCAL PERMITTING FOR EXPANDING PORTS TO FACILITATE EXPANSION OF TRADE AND MOVEMENT OF CARGO. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE SHIPS TO COME TO OAKLAND MANY SHIPS CURRENTLY UNDER LOAD IN LA AND LONG BEACH TO RETURN TO THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. INSTEAD OF GOING TO OAKLAND A LOAD AG COMMODITIES. FOR EXAMPLE 50% OF CALIFORNIA AG COMMODITIES GO THROUGH THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND WE ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THAT. A VERY SUCCESSFUL URBAN AG INTERFACE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO OUR STATE ECONOMY AND ALSO JOBS BOTH IN THE URBAN AREAS IN A RURAL A CALIFORNIA- OTHER COUNTRIES AS A BEEN POINTING OUT FOR CAPITALIZING ON OUR INABILITY TO EXPORT GOODS FILLING THE VOID CHEAPER AND QUICKER. BUSINESS AND TRADE WE MAY NEVER GET BACK. CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU SUPPORTS THE FEDERAL OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE A BILL BY. CONGRESSMAN GARAMENDI AND ALSO CONGRESSMAN- JOHNSON AT A SOUTH DAKOTA BIPARTISAN BILL. THAT WOULD ESTABLISH RECIPROCAL TRADING AS WE LIKE TO STAND FARM HERE WHETHER IT'S- RECIPROCAL TRADER WE CAUGHT FREE TRADE. TRADE THAT DOESN'T GO BOTH WAYS- ISN'T REALLY TRADE- WE WILL ESTABLISH A PHYSICAL TRAIT AS PART OF THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION'S MISSION PROMOTING US EXPORTS. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE OCEAN CARRIERS TO MEET MINIMUM SERVICE STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE BILL WOULD LOVE TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO YOU. AS WELL WE KNOW THAT SENATOR KLOBUCHAR'S MINNESOTA'S ALSO AGAIN INTRODUCED A BILL AS WELL PERTAINING TO TRADE. SO HOW DO WE ESTABLISH GREATER RESILIENCY IN US PORTS CALIFORNIA RELIES HEAVILY ON IMPORTED GOODS. GOODS AS DOES AG'S TECHNOLOGY MACHINERY FERTILIZER SECRETARY ROSS IT ASKED ME TO MENTION ABOUT THE RISING COSTS I WILL POINT OUT THAT FERTILIZER GENERALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS ABOUT 15% OF YOUR CASH- PAYMENTS- WE'RE HEARING REPORTS AND CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING ON OUR FARMS- INCREDIBLY INCREASED COST OF FERTILIZER SOME REPORTS OVER. THREE HUNDRED PERCENT- I ALSO TELL YOU THAT AS WE LOOK AT NOT ONLY A LARGE FARMS IN THE SMALL FARMS EVERYBODY WHO HIT BY THESE RAISING COSTS. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE FARMERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAYBE OPERATE ON A CASH FLOW BASIS WHAT THIS MEANS. IS FOR THEM WILL BE THEIR MINIMUMS WILL GO UP IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN PURCHASE AND SO THEY WILL BE CASH STRAPPED OR MAYBE THEY MAKE TWO OR THREE PAYMENTS IN A YEAR WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO BUY A YEAR'S WORTH AND NOW AS WE LOOK AT MACHINERY. THAT PURCHASING MACHINERY THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OUT NOW. ON% THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLE- PRESSURE PUT ON FARMS AND AGRICULTURE PARTICULARLY SMALLER ONES OPERATING ON A CASH FLOW- ALSO- CAN WE DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AMERICAN TRUCK DRIVERS AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY TRUCK DRIVERS. FEBRUARY SEVENTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL BEGIN REQUIRING THAT ALL NEW COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICANTS. BE TRAINED AND REGISTERED FACILITY. HOW WILL THAT DO FOR REGISTRY WILL AT. GETTING DRIVERS TRAINED OR WILL IT SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. KEEP OUR EYE ON AND ASK FOR SOMETHING TO BE A MODIFIED. AND LET'S ESTABLISH FIXED WINDOWS SUPPORT ACCESS TO AVOID SCHEDULING CONFLICTS AND CONFUSION. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WE FEED. AROUND THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES IS THE BIGGEST AG EXPORTER IN THE WORLD. IN THIS PAST YEARHANDS ARE COMPLETELY TIED BY THE EFFECTS OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WITH CURRENT LABOR ISSUES THAT NOT ONLY AFFECT PORT ACCESS AND EFFICIENCY BUT ALSO A DRIVER SHORTAGE THAT AFFECTS. MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS TO THESE PORTS CURRENTLY FREIGHT LINERS ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE U. S. PORTS WITH EMPTY CONTAINERS. NOT WILLING TO WAIT FOR EXPORTING GOODS SINCE THE US IS BEING OUTBID BY COMPETING. EXPORTERS OVERSEAS. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE GOODS ARE THEN LEFT TO ROT WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE INCREASING THEIR AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO FILL THE VOID. THERE'S NOT ONE SOLUTION TO THIS MULTIPLE PRONGED MULTI PRONGED ISSUE. THE CALIFORNIA CAN HELP IMPLEMENT SMALL CHANGES IN ORDER TO START LEADING SOME OF THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES. ON AGRICULTURE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT TESTIMONY MISTER JOHNSON IF. THANK WITH YOUR HANDS WERE NEXT GOING TO MISS GOING TO OCCUR DAY HAY SEUSS EASTPORT DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF STOCKTON. AND WHAT I NEED TO GET OUT TO THE PORT OF STOCKTON AND NEVER BEEN THERE ARE DRIVEN BY IT. AND SOME OTHERS IN THIS ROOM NEED TO GET OUT TO THE BOARD OF STOCKTON THAT DOESN'T COUNT DRIVE BYS DO NOT COUNT MISTER VEHICLE IT BILL IS GOING TO. GIVE US A TOUR OF THE PORT OF STOCKTON WITH THE STAFF THERE SHORTLY I HOPE. AND AFTERWARDS HE'LL BUY US LUNCH HE'S OFFERED TO DO THAT AS WELL. SO WITH THAT- MISTER TO HAY SEUSS FROM THE PORT OF STOCKTON. AND WHEN YOU ARE READY TO RETHINK YOU. THANKS FOR TIME AFTER. THAT AND- ANYONE IS WELCOME AND WILL. WE BE LUNCH SO PORT STOCKTON SINCE MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT- WEREN'T IMPORT AS MENTIONED SEVEN MILES INLAND. WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND OPERATIONAL ACRES. FOURTEEN BIRTHS SEVENTY FIVE MILES OF RAIL TRACK. ONE COURT PROPERTY- LAST WEEK FOUR POINT NINE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARGO WHICH MAKES US THE FOURTH. BUSIEST CALIFORNIA COURT- AS FAR AS RUSSELL CALLS GO. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS BREAK BOOK. IN BOOK WE DO HAVE THE CAPACITY. IN THE OPERATIONAL ABILITY TO MOVE CONTAINERS. AND ALL TALK ABOUT THAT THE SECOND- WE CAN BE OF SOLUTION MEMORY. SINCE WE ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE SHOULD BE OF THE SOLUTION- AGAIN HAVE THE INTO TEARS. LOOK AFTER ABOUT- FOR SOME OF THE CONTAINER. CONTAINER STORE IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN I DON'T TRUST CRISTINA TALK ABOUT THE EARLIER THINK- NEXT AG EXPO GONNA BUT THEY CURRENTLY BACK- TO BREAK BOX FORM JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BILL BIT THE AND COST- WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND WE'RE SEEING IT MORE ON THE IMPORT SIDE FROM ASIA TO THE US MARKET WE LAST WEEK TWENTY FOUR VESSEL CALLS A COMMODITY THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE IN CONTAINERS- THAT IS MOVING BREAK BALK- BY THE END OF NEXT MONTH WE SHOULD SEE FIFTEEN BUSTLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT 20% INCREASE. IN VESSEL CALLS YEAR OVER YEAR SO WE EXPECT THAT TREND TO CONTINUE OBVIOUSLY MOST THE CARGO. WE THINK WHEN THIS SITUATION. RELAXES FIRST LICENSE WE SEE THAT CARGO TO. BUTSOME OF IT'S GOING TO PERSONALLY SHIFTED IN WALK SO. THE TREND LIKE THAT SAID THAT WAS ASIA TO US WEST COAST MARKETS FOR IMPORT CARGOES WERE STEEP RECEIVING MORE AND MORE INTEREST IN- EXPORTS- AS I SAID WE ARE CONTAINERIZED HE- WE'RE NOT AUTHORIZED CBP TO CLEAR CONTAINERIZED CARGO FROM AN IMPORT. SIDE BUT WE ARE OPERATIONALLY READY TO HANDLE THAT- IN WEEK COULD HANDLE EXPORTCARGO IN CONTAINERS TODAY- AGAIN WERE RECEIVING A BRIEF WORKING WITH QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS ON MAKING THIS HAPPEN- ONE THING FOR THE IMPORT. TASK FORCE CONTAINERS GO CDP SUPPORT FOR THIS CONTAINER SCANNING THE PORT IS IT'S CRITICAL- NECESSARY AND CRITICAL. THE THING THAT WE SEE WITH THIS IT WOULD BE SMALLER VESSELS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OUR DRAFT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND T. E. USE BUT ANY CONTAINER WE HANDLED ORDER STOCKTON. S. POST SENATE- FOR THE WAY. IS TAKING A TRUCK OFF ROAD SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO THE AND JUST ALONG THE. FIVE EIGHTY. IT IS AN SO I THINK THE BIGGEST THING TO GET OUT OF COURSE NOW AWARENESS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO HANDLE THESE COMMODITIES AND- WITH IT AND AGAIN CHANGING THE THINKING. ON HOW THESE COMMODITIES ARE HANDLED EITHER GRATEFUL OR SMALL VESSEL EXPORTS ARE OF COURSE TALKING. THANKS FOR YOUR RETREATED. THANK YOU THANK YOU- AND LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING OUT OF THE PORT OF STOCKTON. YEAH ANY TIME LIKE I SAID RIGHT- WITH THAT I WILL GO TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE pTO THE LAST PANEL- ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MR FONG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- ACTUALLY A QUESTION- THE FOR JB HERE- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA FARMERS LOST AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORT SALES BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR DO THE CONGESTIONS- WHICH CERTAINLY IS A THREAT TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC VIABILITY IS THERE UPDATED NUMBERS- I KNOW THAT WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF. A PANELIST BUT BROADLY I MEAN IS THERE IS THERE AN ESTIMATED NUMBER OF. LOSSES SINCE THEN- I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE NUMBERS OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING THE WHAT WE'RE HEARING THAT WHEN THE NUMBERS DO COME OUT I'M SURE- THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE PORT OF OAKLAND- WOULD- KNOWING CERTAINLY AT THE SONOMA AS WELL BUT THAT AT DECEMBER WILL BE PROBABLY PROBABLY THE WORST MONTH. ON RECORD AND THAT ALSO TO THOSE NUMBERS THE TWO POINT ONE BILLION WAS JUST BETWEEN I BELIEVE MAY AND SEPTEMBER SO YOU ALSO HAVE TO FACTOR IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER. AND DECEMBER WHEN WE GET THOSE NUMBERS SO FROM A TREND STANDPOINT IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER I THINK IT'S GETTING ANY BETTER ONE OF THE LARGEST DAIRY EXPORTERS- RECENTLY- A SAID THAT GOING ON FIELD HE'S LARGEST DAIRY EXPORTER. I BELIEVE IN AMERICA- DOING OF AMONG OTHER THINGS MOZZARELLA CHEESE USUALLY COMING OUT OF THE WEST PORTS BUT NOW. PIVOTING THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTS SUCH AS IN SHREVEPORT- AND HE DOES NOT SEE RECOVERING- HIS EXPORT HIS ABILITY GOING BACK TO WHERE IT WAS FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. THANK YOU AND I JUST- LOCAL LAST QUESTION- TO DANNY AND KIRK- THE CERTAINLY- IT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE SHIPPERS TO- TAKE BACK- FULL CONTAINERS I LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING BOTH THE POOR STOCKTON AND- AND THE PORT OF OAKLAND- AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON LIKE MODERNIZING. FOCUSING ON DIGITALIZATION INFORMATION SHARING WHAT SPECIFICALLY CAN BE DONE AT YOUR PORTS TO FACILITATE THAT AS WELL AS- MAKE. SHIPPERS TAKE BACK FULL CONTAINERS. UP OKAY I WILL START COULD YOU UPGRADE ANY YEAH SO- I THINK I WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS THE TEMPORARY POP UP THE ART IS ONE OF THOSE MEASURES WERE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE TO PROVIDE TO SPACE THE TIME TO ADDRESS BASIN TIME YOU QUIT THAT. TO BOTH- I HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF THE DRUM ROLLS TO PROBATE TO PROVIDE MORE ROOM AND MORE TIME SO THAT- THE- SHIPPERS. I CAN SEE THAT THEIR CAPACITY THAT THEY CAN MOVE THAT CONDITION AT THE POOL. AND THAT WE COMMUTER. IS POPPING UP CUT USED THE SHIPPING LINES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THIS IS TO ASSIST THEM. TO MOVE THE CONTAINERS FASTER SO THAT THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO DO ALL AT PORTABLE OAKLAND YOU WANNA TAKE THOSE EXPORTS AND FILL THE CONTAINERS AND TAKE IT BACK TO ASIA. RATHER THAN TRY AND RATHER THAN DECIDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO WAIT TO SIMPLY CALL BACK ASIA QUICKLY. SO THAT IS ONE OF THOSE HINGS OU CAN DO ON THE ILLINOIS SIDE AND ON THAT SIDE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO CONGESTION NEW INTERNOS AROUND QUICKLY SO THAT THE SHIPPING LINES DON'T LOSE MONEY I GIVE THEIR VIEW. BY WAITING TOO LONG. FOR THE EXPORTS TO BE LOADED. YOU'RE FROM POOREST. SO THINK IT'S LOGISTIC QUESTION IMMEDIATELY GET INTO CONTAINERS HERE TO CENTRAL VALLEY. WHERE THE COMMODITY IS WHERE THE ACT COMMODITY IS. NOT GETTING A LOADED HERE AND THEN GETTING THEM TO REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T SEND THIS- THE CONTAINERS OUTBOUND. FROM THE PORT OF STOCKTON- SMALLER BATCH SO OBVIOUSLY- AND THAT WAY WE CAN ALLEVIATE THE TRAFFIC FLOW ON ON FIVE EIGHTY BUT REALLY THAT THE ISSUE FOR US I THINK IS. THE AVAILABILITY OF EMPTY CONTAINERS AFTER AT THE SOURCE OF THE ORIGIN. SO IF I CAN ASK ONE LAST QUESTION IN IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU GUYS ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT IT MAKES SENSE THEN TO. I KNOW THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS IN THE LAST QUARTER WE HAD ABOUT IDENTIFYING OTHER. INLAND PORTS OR INLAND FACILITIES TO KIND OF RELIEVE PRESSURE- WHICH OF COURSE YOU'RE DOING- IT IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE- BORDER STOCKTON WITH WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED. SHOULD SHOULD THAT BE REPLICATED- IN. OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- YOU KNOW BUYING THE POOR IN. SUCH A VALLEY OR AND- THEY'LL VALLEY. BELIEVING PRESSURE OFF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES- YOU KNOW. IN THE SHORT TERM WOULD THAT BE. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- YES SO TO- TO FACILITATE EVERYTHING. WHY BACK DIRECTORS WHOSE IN MY AND JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY IN FACT- JUST BETWEEN THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND PORT IT- STOCKTON- THERE COULD BE SYNERGIES BETWEEN US IF WE COULD ESTABLISH THAT RAIL LINK BETWEEN THE TWO PORTS. THAT CERTAINLY WE COULD- MAKE SURE THAT THE US DIRECTOR ISSUE SAYS THAT THEY ARE AWARE THERE'S DIFFERENT MODES OF. EXPORTING THE ABNORMALITIES BUT ALSO- TO HAVE RESTOCKED IN SUPPORT INTERNS ARE TAKING A RELIEF OFF OF THE ROLLS AND HIGHWAYS THIS CALL. QUE NO SPACE IN THE INLAND PORT CONCEPT SO THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT- WE WOULD HOPE THAT HE- THE STATE WOULD HELP US INVEST. IN YOU MISTER PRODUCT IS THE MACAW HERE. IF YOU KNOW AND TO X. GOODS. RIGHT BE THE AGRICULTURAL OR IN PRODUCTS OR OTHER BECAUSE LOT OF IT WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT TODAY. BUT THERE'S A MACHINE READ THIS MAN CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST THAT ALSO GOES ON OUR PORCH IS A LOT THAT THAT'S EXPORT BUT OF THE GOAL IS TO. IS TO EXPORT I MEAN ENCOURAGE ENCOURAGEMENT IS GOOD BUT A POLICY IS BETTER. AND I WAS JUST CONVERSING WITH ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHERE MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT- REQUIRING- INSIDE THE PORT CONFERENCE RIGHT THEY SIGNED THE LEASE AS THEIR LITTLE THEY ARE THEY'RE- THEY'RE- THEY'RE LESSORS. THAT WHEN THEY SIGNED THEIR LEASES THE PORTS DO WITH WITH THE PERSON IS LEASING. THE TERMINAL. THAT THEY DO HAVE. SOME TYPE OF- EXPORT REQUIREMENTS I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT AND TO HAVE A LOT OF INPUT IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT BUT IT WOULD BE WISE BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK OF. WEARING AGAIN- THERE IS SOME ONUS ON SOME LEVERAGE. ON THE TERMINAL OPERATORS TO HAVE- IN EXPORT COMPONENT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD LARA YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL- THE WEEDY AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO COMMAND- THE TERMINALS TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE LEGALLY THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HOLD UP ANYWAYS IS INTERSTATE COMMERCE A LOT. AND IS A PRIVATE RELATIONSHIPS WE DON'T WANT TO DELVE INTO THAT TOO MUCH. BUT AGAIN IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO SO THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE. IN ORDER TO GET. MORE MORE EXPORTS BECAUSE PORT SIDE WERE ALREADY. STATE AND ANNA THIS. I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW I WANT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU DEAD- AS YOUR DONALD MEAN CERTAINLY YOU SAID THIS IS OUR LAST HEARING. WE NEED TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY. AND I THINK THAT- I AGREE I AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND- I THINK CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT TO AFFECT THE PRIVATE SECTOR INTERACTIONS. THE MARKET- YOU KNOW. WE WANT ENSURE THE-MARKET- FUNCTIONS AND SO- AND ALLOW THE FREE MARKET SUIT TO PLAY ITSELF OUT SO. I CERTAINLY THINK THERE NEEDED TO POLICY CHANGES IS CERTAINLY- SO ACTED BY- WHAT WITH THE FIVE YEARS SAID. AND BUT I THINK WE ARE CALLING FROM FROM FROM FROM STOCK IN A COLLEAGUES WINTERS. YEAH WE'RE HEARING IT. FROM OUR AGRICULTURAL- INDUSTRY IN OUR FARMERS ISRAEL. HAD A CONSEQUENCES ARE ARE BUILDING UP AND WE NEED TO ACT- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO. IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS WHATEVER WE DO IN TERMS OF MODERNIZATION WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO. TO FACILITATE- THESE INTO CONTAINERS LEAVING IN A FULL CONTAINERS GOING. AND WE NEED TO DO THAT AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. RIGHT MISTER VIA PUT. NUMBER ON. OKAY AS AGUIAR-CURRY. THERE'S SO MUCH I COULD ASK TODAY- POLICE TO BRING TO THE SIR- HAVE A FOR THOSE OF US IN THE AMERICAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING- BUT YOU KNOW I DID HAVE A QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK IN IS LIKE DOES ANYONE TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE- NO- WHEN CALIPH CALIFORNIA IMPORTERS ALSO SUBJECT TO UNFAIR DETENTION DEMURRAGE CHARGES. AS RESULT OF OCEAN KERRIER ACTIONS I MEAN WE COULD GET GETTING THESE FEES- WHEN TRYING TO EXPORT OR SITTING IN SOME JUST WHEN DO THE IMPORTERS GET THAT SIMPLY. YES YES THEY ARE THE MERGERS OF PLY TO BOTH. IT'S NOT WHETHER YOUR EMPLOYER EXPORTER IT'S HOW LONG YOU DO OUT ON THE PORCH. UNDER TRUMP SPACE. THE SUCH AND FEAR- ANYWAY SO I JUST FIRST WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SPEAK TODAY AND WE HEARD YOU BUT I REALLY WISH YOU WULD HAVE HAD MORE TIME FOR YOU TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD OF- ASKED TO SOME VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AS WELL AS HOUSES AFFECTING YOUR FAMILIES YOUR YOU KNOW THE FARMS- WHAT'S PESTS WE HAD TO PASS IT YOU PUT IN THE PAST AND ISSUES LIKE THAT I MEAN I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT DISEASE AN INCREASE. ON THE ASPECT OF IMPACTS ON YOUR BUSINESS I MEAN ALL THESE THINGS WE DIDN'T GET ASKED TODAY SHOULD WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE THESE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK- BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY- PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ON THE- LINE HERE THERE'S PRODUCTS SITTING IN WAREHOUSES JUST SITTING THERE THE PRICES ARE GOING DOWN IT THE CALIFORNIA BRAND WE ARE SO PROUD OF THE CALIFORNIA BRANCH. WHEN YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS UP RICE BAGS OR IS NOT PREVENTING IT WOULD JUST IT JUST MAKES MORE ECONOMICAL SENSE TO SEND THEM DIFFERENTLY SO I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO- A REALLY A BIG KNOWLEDGE WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME POLICY COME OUT OF THIS I KNOW I'M WORKING ON SOME I THINK OTHERS ARE AS WELL. ARAMBULA FIX THIS RIGHT AWAY I WISH I COULD SAY YES BUT I THINK WE AS A TEAM NEED TO WORK ON THIS AND MAKE SURE IT'S URGENT YEAH I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS A CALIFORNIA EXPORT POLICY I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE IS ONE. NO ONE BROUGHT ONE UP TODAY SO MAYBE IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO CREATE ONE AND UNDER THAT UMBRELLA MANY THINGS FALL COULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE IT CAN BE POLICIES WITH REGARD TO EXPORTS ON THE DOCK CETERA SO- THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS.
