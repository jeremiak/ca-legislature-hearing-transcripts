HOLDS BUT WELL TO THE SIDE I'M

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.437
HOPING THAT HAPPY. TO LOOK AT

TECHNICAL SYSTEM OKAY WELL I I

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.982
THINK I THINK THE IDEA IS THE OF

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.550
THAT --

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.018
BROUGHT UP IN MULTIPLE HEARINGS

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.019
BEFORE EIGHT WE WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.054
THE ITEMS WE THINK OKAY V. PUT

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.824
MONEY INTO SOMETHING WE ALWAYS

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.158
SCORE ACOSTA THAT RIGHT.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.059
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT WHAT

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.394
HAPPENS WE DON'T DO IT WHAT

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.329
HAPPENS RIGHT SO --

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:15.664
I DON'T THINK THE SENIORS WHO

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.032
WOULD TAKE UP THE ADDITIONAL

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.734
POSITIONS.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.803
ARE GOING TO BE NOT.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.738
DOWN THE AND NOT GOING TO TO

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.072
DELTA THE THING IS IS THAT IF WE

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.540
HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW IN

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:26.675
NURSING HOMES ARE TO COULD HAVE

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.744
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.679
NURSING HOME SUIT DOWN.

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.080

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:57.132
COULD BE --

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.401
USED ON AS A POINT OF

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:00.735
CONSIDERATION.

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:03.772
SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:06.040
I'M GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.942
THE CURRENT L. TSS SYSTEM AND

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:08.910
THEN ALSO HOW IS THAT MEETING

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.813
THE CURRENT NEEDS OF SENIORS AND

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.915
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES --

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.450
PROJECTING OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.886
DO EXPECT IN THE FUTURE WILL BE

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.621
NEEDING SOME FORM OF L. TSS

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.790
SERVICES --

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:24.058
WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES WHAT THEY

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.160
NEED?

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.895
AND THEN ALSO THINKING WE HAVE

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:28.363
OUR CURRENT BUCKET OF LTE SAYS

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.532
PROGRAMS BUT THEN THAT IN THIS

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:31.666
CONCEPT OF FUTURE PLANNING DOES

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.001
THAT THE NECESSITATE THE

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.269
CONVERSATION UP ARE THERE

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.571
ADDITIONAL TSS PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.573
THAT MAY NEED TO BE INTRODUCED

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.808
INTO THE MIX --

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.075
LASTLY THINGS THAT WE ALSO

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:43.278
MENTIONED IS HOW WILL THE FUTURE

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:45.013
ALTI ASSIST UTILIZATION AND

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:46.848
PACKED THE FINANCING OF THE

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.850
STATE FUNDED LTO SUCH PROGRAMS

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.218
AS WELL.

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:51.186
THOSE ARE FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:51.986
LAID OUT AND I KNOW THE

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.354
PANELISTS WILL SPEAK MORE

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.656
BROADLY IN TOUCH ON OTHER

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.357
DIMENSIONS OF THIS CONCEPT OF A

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.159
MASTER PLAN.

01:24:58.226 --> 01:24:58.626
THANK YOU.

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.762
ALL RIGHT DR WEBER [inaudible]

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:05.400
WELCOME.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.468
GOOD MORNING --

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:07.969
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:10.171
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:11.940
THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC --

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:14.008
I WORK WITH GERONTOLOGIST AND

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:16.878
DEMOGRAPHER'S AND A LONGEVITY

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.713
EXPERTS AND WE'VE SEEN

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.181
TREMENDOUS STRIDES AS YOU KNOW

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.116
AND WE'RE ALL HAPPY ABOUT THE

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.151
FACT THAT WE ARE AN AGING

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.986
SOCIETY LIVING INTO OUR EIGHTIES

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:25.854
AND NINETIES.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.388
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I DON'T

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.457
THINK WE DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:30.925
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:34.095
OLDER AGES OF QUALITY OF LIFE

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:37.532
AND THAT IT'S A SECURE OLD AGE.

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.501
IN PREPARING FOR THIS I KIND OF

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.969
LOOK BACK AND I HAVE TO SAY I'VE

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:42.370
BEEN COMING UP HERE FOR A VERY

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.405
LONG TIME I'VE WORKED ON FIVE

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.708
MAJOR PROJECTS WITH THE STATE.

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:47.842
STARTING IN THE NINETEEN

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:48.910
EIGHTIES AND AS I LOOKED IT WAS

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.144
EVERY ABOUT EVERY DECADE AND

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.146
THEN IT'S TIGHTENED UP WITH SOME

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.048
OF THE PROJECTS WE'VE DONE ONE

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.283
WAS --

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.817
CALLED THE LONG TERM CARE

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:58.052
INTEGRATION.

01:25:58.119 --> 01:25:59.420
WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO INTEGRATE

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.689
MEDICARE AD MEDICAID AND LONG

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:03.157
TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DATA?

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.826
ACROSS TWENTY COUNTIES AND

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.327
ANSWER SOME VERY INTERESTING

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.162
QUESTIONS BEFORE THAT WAS SHUT

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:11.366
DOWN WE ALSO WORKED ON A PROJECT.

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:13.301
TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:14.869
DATA WAREHOUSE --

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:17.639
BECAUSE OF HIGH.

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.340
I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT KIND

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:20.842
OF WHAT WE KNOWN WHAT DATA ARE

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:23.144
AVAILABLE AND THE THE PROBLEM IS

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.412
THAT I DON'T THINK WE KNOW

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:26.080
NEARLY ENOUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:28.082
HAVE THE DATA --

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:30.885
MOST RECENTLY WE WORKED AND MOST

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:31.753
OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:34.322
BETWEEN UCLA AND USC SO WE'RE

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:35.690
ABLE TO COORDINATE ACROSS THOSE

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:36.724
ENTITIES --

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:40.295
BUT THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.596
LOOKING AT A UNIVERSAL

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:44.632
ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT AND LOTS

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.200
OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:47.302
THAT PROJECT.

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:48.603
A AND I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.305
INFORMATION THAT'S STILL OUT

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:52.340
THERE FOR ALL THESE PROJECTS. TO

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:56.411
BUILD ON AND THE SORT OF

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:59.314
THINKING ABOUT THE KEY TAKEAWAYS

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.215
SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE HEARD.

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:02.984
REPEATEDLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.619
WERE AN AGING SOCIETY PEOPLE

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.788
RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ONE AGENT

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:07.355
PLACE.

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.157
AND TO DO THAT THEY NEED HOUSING

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.491
AND THEY NEED SERVICES AND THEY

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.060
NEED SUPPORTS COMING INTO THEIR

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.261
HOMES --

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:14.295
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.030
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD

01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:17.565
BE PULLED IN --

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:20.268
FROM CO HOUSING TO THE CAPABLE

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.669
PROGRAM WHICH BRINGS HANDYMAN

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:23.371
INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:26.074
INTENTIONAL COMMUNITIES --

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:26.674
I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS OVER

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.911
AND OVER AND CARE GIVERS FAMILY

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.713
CARE GIVERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:33.514
THE CURRENT LONG TERM SERVICES

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:34.349
AND SUPPORTS.

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:37.452
BETWEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.987
BILLION BILLION DOLLARS WHICH

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.321
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.757
ABOUT DOUBLE CALIFORNIA'S MEDI

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:43.891
CAL.

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:46.728
CONTRIBUTION SO THAT'S HUGE BUT

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:48.363
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'VE HEARD

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.831
OVER AND OVER FROM PEOPLE.

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:52.266
MAKING PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE SEEN

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:53.768
SERVICES KAT.

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.137
AND TERMINATED SO THE CARE GIVER

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.772
RESOURCE CENTERS COME BEEN CUT

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.307
BACK DRAMATICALLY.

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:00.975
AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT AND I

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.276
HAVE TO SAY HAVE BEEN COMING UP

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:04.312
HERE TO TESTIFY FOR THESE THIRTY

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:04.946
YEARS SAYING.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.648
WE'RE GOING TO BE AN AGING

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:09.651
SOCIETY WE NEED TO GET READY.

01:28:09.717 --> 01:28:10.852
LOOKS LIKE I DIDN'T DO THAT

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.286
COMPELLING A JOB BECAUSE WE

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:14.822
DIDN'T GET READY AND NOW --

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.157
NOW WE EED --

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.359
TO WE STILL HAVE SILO DATA I

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:19.894
THINK THE CHEST QUESTIONS WILL

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.063
BE REALLY HELPFUL --

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.166
BUT WE REALLY NEED DATA TO HELP

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.100
US.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:28.036
ANSWER SOME OF THE CORE

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:30.204
QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF SERVICE

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:33.608
PATTERNS AND DUPLICATION --

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:36.044
WHAT WHAT DOES CREATE RISK FOR

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:37.712
NURSING FACILITY PLACEMENT AND

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:38.646
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:39.914
LOOKED AT WITH MONEY FOLLOWS THE

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.349
PERSON?

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.785
WHO'S ACTUALLY ABLE TO COME OUT

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.054
AND WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.688
ARE IN FACILITIES THAT HAVE KIND

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:49.190
OF RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO GO

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.591
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY DON'T.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:51.793
EXIT THE FACILITY BECAUSE

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.327
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM IN THE

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:55.229
COMMUNITY SO THOSE KINDS OF

01:28:55.296 --> 01:29:00.234
QUESTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT --

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:03.604
SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:04.672
ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I JUST

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:06.407
WANT TO MAKE A FEW MORE COMMENTS

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.309
ACROSS THESE FIVE STUDIES IN

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.477
THESE THIRTY YEARS.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.779
SO FIRST CALIFORNIA HAS SOME

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:12.947
VERY INNOVATIVE AND REALLY

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.582
IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.517
HEARD ABOUT THEM AND THE AMASIS

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:18.519
P. I. TO SAYS --

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:21.055
BUT WHAT WE'VE LACKED IS A

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.323
COHERENT VISION.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.592
OF FOR PEOPLE TO AGING PLACE TO

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:27.595
HAVE OF PERSON CENTERED CARE.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:30.298
BECAUSE WE FLEXIBLE POLITICAL

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:32.166
WILL AND SO I THINK NOW WE'RE AT

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:33.601
THE JUNCTURE WHERE THE AGING

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.303
POPULATION IS HERE.

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:38.072
AND IT'S REALLY TIME TO MOVE

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.108
AHEAD WITH THE MASTER PLAN TO

01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:41.642
PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.277
ON THE TASK AND SEE IF

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.179
CALIFORNIA CAN --

01:29:45.246 --> 01:29:47.181
GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:47.448
THANK YOU.

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:49.217

JUST PRIOR TO RETIRING IN TWO

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:13.141
THOUSAND FIVE SO THAT POINT I

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.575

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.021
THE COST OF THINGS HERE FROM

AND WALGREENS ON FILLED IT.

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:32.873
AND THEN THEY TOLD ME THAT

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.742
BECAUSE I WAS OVER SEVENTY YEARS

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:36.143
OLD.

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:38.179
THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE THE DOCTOR

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:40.414
OR TO RISE TO PRESCRIPTION.

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.016

ACTUALLY IN THE FORMULA WE BOOK

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:50.691

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:51.792
SEVENTY THE DOCTOR HAS TO LOOK

I GOT IT BUT YOU KNOW I I DON'T

01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:00.634
KNOW WHERE THAT.

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:03.270
OKAY TRANSPORTATION IS ANOTHER

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.840
THING IS THAT THAT'S HOW DO WE

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.074
GET TO WHERE WE DON'T HOW DO YOU

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:08.943
MOVE AROUND.

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.711
AND THE LAST THING I AM

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.179
CONCERNED WITH HIS ADULT DAYCARE

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:16.751
THERE'S A LOT OF LEVELS OF AG.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:17.385
DECIDE TO TAKE YOUR BABY TO THE

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:19.320
NURSERY.

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:20.388
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MOTHER YOUR

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:21.555
GRANDMA.

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.757
AND WHY YOU GO TO WORK.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.426
THEY'LL BE ON GIVEN YOUR

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.728
MEDICINE FED AND ENTERTAINED

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:28.729
SOCIALLY IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.498
GET OUT.

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:33.801
AND HANG OUT WITH OTHER SENIORS.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:36.404
IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS HANG OUT AT

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:40.574
THE WELL.

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:41.275
FOR THE WAY --

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.676
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:44.745
OF A FACILITY IN PLEASANT HILL

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:47.314
THEY DO A TREMENDOUS JOB.

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.082
DATE -- BUT

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.184
THEY HAVE SOME LOW INCOME SLOT

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.786
WITHIN YEARS SO I THINK THE

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.587
COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.923

AND AND IT'S SUCH A BROAD

01:36:01.555 --> 01:36:03.357
CATEGORY THAT I DON'T THINK.

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.426
I CAN DO ANY OF THAT JUSTICE IN

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:06.994
THE TIME WE HAVE HERE --

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.562
AS ARE THE SOLUTIONS THEY'RE

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:11.132
EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND TAKE A

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:13.634
DETAILED LINK THE I TACK ON THE

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.503
THE VERY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WE

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.304
FACE BUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT I

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:18.906
WANT TO SHARE ABOUT.

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:20.241
DOCUMENTING THE I JUST THINK

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.942
THAT SHEER NUMBERS OF OUR

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:23.444
POPULATION DOES THAT.

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:24.778
RIGHT NOW THE SIXTY PLUS

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:26.814
POPULATION IS AT EIGHT POINT TWO

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.849
MILLION IN THE STATE. TEN OF

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:33.154
THOSE. ONE OUT OF SIX LIVE ALONE.

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.688
AND LONELINESS AND ISOLATION IS

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:35.756
A TOPIC THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:38.559
HEARING A LOT ABOUT IN THE-COMING YEARS.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.361
IT'S KIND OF BEEN IGNORED WE

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:41.795
KIND OF HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:42.830
MAINTAIN.

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:44.465
THE CORE SERVICES THAT WE HALF

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:47.201
BUT IT'S BEEN STUDY THAT LIVING

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:47.902
ALONE --

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.870
BEING ISOLATED IS THE EQUIVALENT

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:52.006
OF SPOKE SMOKING HALF A PACK A

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.841
DAY OF CIGARETTES ON ON YOUR

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.476
HEALTH CARE.

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:58.212
SO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DESIGN

01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:59.680
IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE.

01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:00.481
NEED TO COMBAT THAT IN MANY OF

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:03.150
THEM OFTEN IT'S ONE OF THE PUT

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:06.320
THAT PIECE INTO THE MAX. ONE OUT

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.355
OF EVERY.

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:09.456
FIVE OTHERS SIXTY PLUS

01:37:09.523 --> 01:37:12.293
POPULATION IS MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE.

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.761
SO I THINK THAT'LL LOAN

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:16.063
DOCUMENTS THE NEED.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.398
JUST POVERTY WE ALL KNOW THE

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.433
CAUSES AND CHALLENGES AND

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.335
RESULTS OF POVERTY AND IF WE

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:22.937
HAVE ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

01:37:23.003 --> 01:37:24.905
SENIORS LIVING IN POVERTY WE

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.874
HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS.

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:28.342
IF YOU ASK ME THREE YEARS AGO

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:29.843
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD THINK WE

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.844
WOULD NEED.

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:31.979
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING TWO

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.480
THINGS WE NEED TO ELEVATE THE

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.849
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OLDER

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.352
ADULT POPULATION.

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:39.386
CHAMPIONS.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:41.188
AND I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT WE

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.890
KIND OF DONE THAT YOU KNOW I'M

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:44.425
LOOKING AT LEGISLATIVE CHAMPIONS

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:45.326
RIGHT NOW.

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.794
AND THE WHOLE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.163
TALKING ABOUT A MASTER PLAN AN

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.198
AGING SHOWS WITH ELEVATED THAT

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:52.433
CONVERSATION.

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:53.734
SO THE CHALLENGE NOW BECOMES

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:55.603
WELL NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED WHAT

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.837
DO WE DO ABOUT IT.

01:37:56.904 --> 01:37:59.139
HOW TO REMOVE THIS YOU'VE ISSUE

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.307
FORWARD --

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:00.975
THERE'S A COUPLE KEY THINGS THAT

01:38:01.041 --> 01:38:02.109
ARE HAPPENING.

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:04.478
ON THE BAD NEWS YOU HEARD ONE OF

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:05.546
OUR PRESENTERS EARLIER.

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.181
STATE THAT THE STATE GENERAL

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:11.118
FUND CONTRIBUTION TO OUR CORE

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:13.687
OLDER ADULT PROGRAMS HAS DROPPED

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.389
BY THIRTY MILLION.

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:19.994
OVER THE LAST DECADE IN TWO

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:20.794
SIXTY TWO SIXTY THREE MILLION.

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.129
AND THAT DROPPED ALL THE WAY

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.965
DOWN TO THIRTY TWO MILLION.

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.233
AND THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE'S

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.568
BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT TO GET

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.236
SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK AND WE

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:30.938
GOT TWO TO THREE MILLION BACK

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:31.805
WHICH IS.

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:32.840
YOU KNOW HER RAY WERE REALLY

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:35.109
HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT CLEARLY WE

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:37.711
HAVE THIRTY MILLION TO MAKE UP

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.480
JUST TO GET WHERE WE WERE EN

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:40.180
YEARS AGO.

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.682
AND THAT WAS WITH A MUCH SMALLER

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.050
POPULATION.

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:44.718
AND NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT WAS

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.420
ACT AS ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:47.521
AS TODAY.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:49.123
SO I THINK THAT'S THE CHANNELS

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:50.291
THAT I WOULD THROUGHOUT THEIR

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:53.327
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:54.795
PROGRAMS THAT WORK.

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.263
WE JUST NEED TO INVEST IN THEM.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.531
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:59.500
RECREATE THE WHEEL WE NEED TO RE

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.001
CREATE HOW THE INTERFACE WITH

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.169
EACH OTHER.

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.337
AND THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE OLDER

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:05.873
CALIFORNIANS ACT IS BEING LOOKED

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:08.042
AT TO DEVELOP A CALIFORNIA A

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.810
COMMUNITY LIVING HOT. TO MAKE

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.145
SURE THAT WERE REALLY COMBINING

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:13.113
SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.015
WHAT'S NEEDED IS GETTING TO

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:16.483
PEOPLE IN THE MOST COST

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.851
EFFICIENT WAY.

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.987
BUT THAT COMMITMENTS. TO WHAT

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.555
ALREADY WORKS TO WHAT WE KNOW

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:23.157
WORKS.

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:24.725
IT'S CRITICAL NOW COURTS WE NEED

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.160
TO INNOVATE WE NEED NEW PROGRAMS

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:27.261
THAT'S ALWAYS PART OF WHATEVER

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:28.128
CHALLENGES.

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.130
BUT WE WHEN WE HAVE EXISTING

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.699
SERVICES THAT WORK WELL.

01:39:31.765 --> 01:39:33.200
AND WE JUST DECIDED NOT TO FIND

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.968
THEM WE DON'T HAVE A CRISIS IN

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:37.171
POLICY WE HAVE A CRISIS IN

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:38.372
FUNDING.

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.674
AND WE DON'T JUST NEED AN MASTER

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:43.010
PLAN ON AGING WEEDING UP MASTER

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.578
PLAN ON PAYING FOR AGING.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.313
AND JUST TO WRAP UP I I KNOW MY

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.717
TIMES JUST TO BRING THAT PIECE

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:50.918
TOGETHER.

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.619
WE ALSO KNOW THAT HEALTH CARE

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:55.556
COSTS IN THE LAST 20% OF YOUR

01:39:55.622 --> 01:39:59.059
LIFE CONSTITUTE ABOUT 80% OF ALL

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.994
OUR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES.

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.963
SO IF WE DO NOTHING WE'RE STILL

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:05.299
GOING TO HAVE A BUDGET CRISIS

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.967
DEALING WITH OLDER ADULTS WE'RE

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:08.502
GOING TO BE SPENDING ALL THESE

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:10.771
DOLLARS. TO DEAL WITH EMERGING

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.039
HEALTH CARE.

01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:13.974
AND THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:16.009
INTERVENTION WE CAN TAKE.

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.978
YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT EASIER TO

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:20.447
PUT A GRAB BAR AND A BATHROOM.

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:23.517
THE END IS TO REPLACE A HIP WHEN

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:25.085
SOMEBODY'S FALLEN AND BROKEN

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:25.285
THAT.

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.620
SO.

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:27.287
I BELIEVE OUR CHALLENGE AND WHAT

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:28.889
THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING SHOULD

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:31.492
FOCUS ON IS NOT HOW MUCH WE'RE

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.193
GOING TO SPEND BECAUSE THAT'S A

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:33.794
GIVEN.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.162
THE MASS SAYS WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:36.463
SPEND A LOT.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.931
BUT LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE CAN

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:40.567
SPEND THOSE DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY.

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:42.569
COMPASSIONATELY AND IN A WAY

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:44.872
THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:47.474
EXPENDITURES THAT THE STATE HAS.

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:48.409
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:49.910
EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:51.712
BUT TO SPEND THE DOLLARS RIGHT

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.180
AND MAKE EVERYBODY'S LIFE

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:56.350
PATTERN MAKER BUDGET LOOK BETTER.

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:56.984
AND WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.284

DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT THAT WILL FACE

IN THE COMING DECADE.

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:33.113
NOT ONLY WILL WE SEE A

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.381
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER

IN THE COMPOSITION OF ALL

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:40.454
CALIFORNIANS.

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.222
THE COHORT OF OLDER ADULTS IS

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:43.657
MORE LIKELY TO BE SINGLE.

POLICY THAT'S GONNA PREPARES FOR

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.268
THE SHIFT I THINK IT'S GOING TO

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.769
BE A COMBINATION OF PROGRAMS AND

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:57.204

AND PUBLIC SECTOR.

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:04.344
AND EVEN INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:05.746
MILLNNIALS WE HAVE TO COME TO

01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:07.080

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:08.515
A ONE THIRD OF US OUR CURRENT

BE CARE GIVERS IN THE NEXT FIVE

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.787
YEARS AND AS MANY PEOPLE ALLUDED

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.124
TO BE AT THIS TABLE.

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.258
AS PART OF OUR WORK ON THE

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:20.060
MASTER PLAN AN AGING WE HAVE TO

01:43:20.127 --> 01:43:21.528
THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW WE

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:22.029
DELIVER OUR PROGRAMS AND

01:43:22.095 --> 01:43:23.263

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:25.966
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RECOMMIT

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.739
INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE OUR CLIENTS.

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:34.341
FOR DECADES PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:35.609

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:37.010
DELIVER TO SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:38.045
OF GOVERNMENT.

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.279
HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS LIKE MRS

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.148
JONES.

01:43:41.214 --> 01:43:41.748
THEY DON'T LIVE THEIR LIVES IN

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:42.983
SILOS.

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:44.418
OUR VISION FOR THE MASTER PLAN

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:45.852
ON AGING IS THAT IT WILL SERVE

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.854
AS A BLUEPRINT THAT CAN BE USED

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:48.956
BY STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:50.991
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY PUBLIC AND

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:52.359
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.760
PHILANTHROPY TO BUILT

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.462
ENVIRONMENTS A PROPOSED HEALTHY

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:56.730
AGING.

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:57.998
AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.333
THIS IS NOT JUST GOVERNMENT

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:01.335
GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO THIS ALONE

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.070
WE MUST DO THIS TOGETHER.

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:04.404
WE CAN ONLY DO THIS COLLECTIVELY

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:06.039
PRESSURING IDEAS AND CONNECTING

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:07.841
PEOPLE STORIES AND DATA WE ALL

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:08.909
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY ENSURING

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.744
THAT OLDER CALIFORNIANS CAN

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:12.379
AGENT PLACE AND WITH THE DIGNITY.

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:14.381
SO THE QUESTION BEFORE US TRULY

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:16.650
IS HOW CAN WE CREATE AN AGING

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.251
FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES FOR ALL ALL

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:19.386
OLDER ADULTS.

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:20.921
THIS MEANS THAT OUR WORK MUST GO

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:24.124
BEYOND JUST THE RESEARCH SHOWS

01:44:24.191 --> 01:44:25.425
THAT UNDERLYING SOCIAL FACTORS

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:27.494
LIKE SO THANK HOUSING AND

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.762
TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD.

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.364
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.965
INDIVIDUALS WELL BEING AND AND

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.734
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THIS IS TRUE

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.902
FOR CHILDREN AS MUCH AS IT IS

01:44:35.969 --> 01:44:36.503
FOR ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS AS

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:37.537
WELL.

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:38.572
ADDITIONALLY THE MASTER PLAN

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:40.073
MUST NOT ONLY FOCUS ON PUBLIC

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.875
PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER IN MUST

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.243
BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL OLDER

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.211
CALIFORNIANS.

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:45.012
THERE ARE MANY OLDER

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.513
CALIFORNIANS THAT DON'T UTILIZE

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.782
OUR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND WE MUST

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:49.850
ENCOMPASS THEM AS WELL.

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:51.818
FINALLY THE MASTER PLAN MUST BE

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.754
ACTIONABLE WE HAVE TO HOLD

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.155
OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE.

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.423
AND WE MUST DEVELOP CONCISE

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.991
METRICS THAT WILL HELP US

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.292
EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS.

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:00.894
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.562
ACT WITH URGENCY HOWEVER THERE

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.197
ARE NUMBER STEPS THAT WE CAN

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:05.732
TAKE AND HAVE TAKEN TO SET THE

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:06.967
FOUNDATION TO ACCELERATE THIS

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:09.503
WORK AT THE AGENCY.

01:45:09.569 --> 01:45:10.804
FIRST WERE BETTER LEVERAGING

01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:13.140
PUBLIC DATA WE'RE DATA RICH BUT

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:14.641
INFORMATION POOR WHAT DOES THAT

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.710
MEAN WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.445
BUT WE DO A POOR JOB USING IT

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.546
TURN FORMER.

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:21.381
PROGRAM DELIVERY DATA MUST

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.250
INFORM THE MASTER PLAN AND IT

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:24.685
CAN HELP IMPROVE PROGRAM OUT

01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:26.253
REACH SERVICE DELIVERY AND

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:27.688
ULTIMATELY CLIENT LIVES.

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:28.922
SECOND WE'RE CHANGING THE

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.524
CULTURE AND WITHIN OUR

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.859
ORGANIZATION WE MUST FOCUS ON

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.261
HOW WE BETTER DELIVER PROGRAMS

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.929
AND SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.664
OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. TOO

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:38.932
OFTEN WERE FOCUSED ON THE

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:40.600
DEVELOPING PROGRAMS BASED ON

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:44.071
WHAT'S CONVENIENT WITHIN THE

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:45.005
SILO STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT.

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:45.906
THE MASTER PLAN MUST ENVISION A

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:46.773
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT'S

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.208
EASY TO NAVIGATE FROM THE

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:49.776
PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSUMER.

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:51.211
AND AS GOVERNMENT IT'S OUR DUTY

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.312
TO ENSURE THAT WE WRAP THESE

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:53.847
PROGRAMS AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:54.948
INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE.

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:56.450
FINALLY WE'RE DEVELOPING

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.218
PROGRAMS WITH OUR CLIENTS NOT

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.853
FOR THEM THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.254
TO ENGAGE OUR CLIENTS MEETING

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:02.756
FLEET IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:03.857
SO THAT THEY ARE PART OF IT SO

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:06.660
THE MASTER ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:08.361

WHAT WASN'T DONE --

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:03.810
DECADES AGO IN PREPARING FOR

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:07.614
THIS EVENTUALITY --

01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:09.282
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP MY MY

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:11.151
GRANDPARENTS WERE GETTING SOCIAL

FIRST CAME OUT AND WOMEN MY

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.291

BENEFICIARIES OF IT ACTUALLY YOU

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:20.961
CASH YOU LIVE ON IT.

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.770
MODEST INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:33.073
OVER THE YEARS --

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:35.442
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY

01:48:35.508 --> 01:48:37.611
CHALLENGING FOR ANYONE. TO TO

MASTER PLAN --

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:53.393
I THINK A PART OF THAT IS --

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.095
REACHING OUT TO OUR MILLENNIALS

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:56.830

AND AND HIGHLIGHTING THE

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:03.036
IMPORTANCE OF EMBRACING PROGRAMS

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:04.738
THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:07.340
IN THE POSITION --

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:08.875
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:45.779
HAVING YOU HERE FROM A VERY

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.480
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY THEY WERE

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:49.215
VERY LUCKY THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:52.519
YOUR CALIBER HERE TODAY SO --

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:55.789
AS AS A FELLOW TROJAN I'M I'M

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.190
DELIGHTED TO HEAR I WAS.

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:59.492
WHAT WHITE WHY IS IT THAT --

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:01.261
THERE ARE BARRIERS FOR FOR

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:04.097
MEDICAL LAST CALIFORNIANS TODAY --

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:06.066
TO PLANNED THIS THIS EVENTUAL

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:08.234
FUTURE --

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:10.036
AND AND AND WHY DO YOU THINK.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.037
THAT -- WE

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:13.406
ONLY SEE 5% OF CALIFORNIANS THAT

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:17.444
BOTTLE AS LONG TERM INSURANCE --

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:19.179
REFLECT THE THE OVERWHELMING

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:20.447
NEED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SAYING

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.749
IN THE FUTURE.

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.150
SO I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:25.518
ANSWERS TO THAT --

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:27.754
ONE IS THAT WHEN IT'S

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:29.689
INEXPENSIVE TO BUY IT IS WHEN

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:31.057
YOU'RE YOUNG YEAH BUT WHEN

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.792
YOU'RE YOUNG YOU HAVE TO THINK

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:34.828
ABOUT EDUCATING YOURSELF.

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.363
OF MORTGAGE MAY BE --

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:38.098
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT GETTING

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:41.067
YOUR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:41.735
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:42.736
ARE HIGHER PRIORITIES IF YOU IN

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:43.603
FACT.

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:45.171
HAVE ANY DISCRETIONARY INCOME TO

01:50:45.238 --> 01:50:48.208
PUT TOWARDS THOSE THINGS.

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:50.176
BUT AS YOU REACH RETIREMENT AGE

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:51.678
AND BEYOND WHEN YOU REALLY START

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:53.179
THINKING YOU NEED LONG TERM CARE

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.581
INSURANCE.

01:50:54.647 --> 01:50:56.883
IT'S PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:59.386
BECAUSE IMAGE THE INSURERS SNOW

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:01.988
THAT IT'S AN INSURED EVENTS THAT

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:06.359
IS UP ALSO IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:08.361
COST IT OUT FAR AWAY.

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:11.031
AND SO AND SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:13.967
LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS AN

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:16.002
INSURANCE PRODUCTS --

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:17.871
THERE HAVE BEEN.

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.406
EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:22.042
BUT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO AS

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:23.143
YOU KNOW TO EVEN SAVE FOR

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:26.146
RETIREMENT BEYOND CELS SECURITY.

01:51:26.212 --> 01:51:27.547
SO LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:29.082
SEEMS LIKE.

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:32.152
OF SOMETHING THAT'S DOWN THE

01:51:32.218 --> 01:51:33.920
ROAD IN TERMS OF A PRIORITY FOR

01:51:33.987 --> 01:51:35.422
MANY PEOPLE AND THEN I'LL JUST

01:51:35.488 --> 01:51:38.491
SAY ONE OTHER THING --

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:40.794
THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.763
IS NOT ALL THAT GREAT OFTEN AND

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.833
SO DOES IT INCLUDE INFLATION --

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.601
WE'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE PURCHASE

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:50.003
IT AND THEN THE PRODUCT IS NO

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.938
LONGER THERE SO WE NEED A LOT OF

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.907
SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:54.974
DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO AS

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:55.175
WELL.

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.109
WOULD YOU SEE WOULD YOU SEE IS

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:57.210
GOVERNMENT'S ROLE SHOULD

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:59.012
GOVERNMENT --

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.313
ESTABLISH SOME TYPE OF A FUND.

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:03.116
THAT OUR CITIZENS CAN CONTRIBUTE.

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:06.219
VOLUNTARILY --

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:07.520
TO INSURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:10.457
SIGNIFICANT HELP AND RESOURCES

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.192
WHEN THEY RETIRE SO.

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:13.960
I I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF WE

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:15.328
STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.630
PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT HAPPENED TO

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.199
THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE.

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:20.333
A MODEL THAT PEOPLE COULD

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:24.437
PARTICIPATE IN.

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:27.040
SO A CALIFORNIA AND THREE OTHER

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.975
STATES HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE YOU

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:31.444
COULD INSURE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:32.712
ASSETS --

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.514
YOU COULD DECIDE AND THEN WHEN

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:35.949
YOU HAD SPENT DOWN TO THOSE

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:37.417
ASSETS.

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:38.852
THEN YOU COULD GO ON STATE

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:42.055
MATTER CAL AND SO IT WAS A WAY

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:43.756
TO TO KIND OF OFFER A PROTECTION

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:45.091
AND MAYBE --

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:46.926
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AT THE

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:49.095
HEARING NOW IF THIS IN FACT AND

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.431
MAYBE AT LONG WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:53.633
IT DOES THIS EXIST --

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:56.336
THIS WAS A THIS WAS A BIG IDEA

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:58.004
AND THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN

01:52:58.071 --> 01:52:59.205
CALIFORNIA WAS A LEADER --

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.574
SO.

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.676
I I THINK THERE ARE SOME MODELS

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:05.044
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF

01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:07.147
VERY SMART PEOPLE HAVE WORKED ON

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.615
THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:10.316
AND HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:12.986
KIND OF PANACEA FOR IT

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:13.286
[inaudible]

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:16.623
OKAY. ONE THING IT'S BEEN TALKED

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:18.858
ABOUT IS CREATING A LONG TERM

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:21.294
CARE INSURANCE STATE PROGRAM

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:23.997
SIMILAR TO DISABILITY INSURANCE.

01:53:24.063 --> 01:53:26.299
WHICH BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:29.068
EMPLOYER POSSIBLY THE STATE

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.403
COULD COULD PAIN.

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:31.938
TOO AND I THINK THE PLACE TO

01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:34.174
LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.476
WOULD BE SOMEHOW CALCULATE THE

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.244
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:39.546
TO SPEND DOWN.

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:43.116
THEIR SAVINGS AND USE MEDI CAL

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.852
MEDICAID TO PAY FOR THEIR LONG

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:46.886
TERM CARE.

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:47.921
WHEN A WHEN THEY GO INTO A

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:50.490
NURSING HOME AND SEE YOU KNOW DO

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.859
A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON?

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:54.294
HOW MUCH DOES COST COULD BE

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.863
DIVERTED BY CREATING THIS STATE

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.364
LONG TERM INSURANCE PLAN WITH

01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:00.333
THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION ARE

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:00.934
YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER STATES

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.668
SORT OF --

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:03.603
TAKEN ON AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:06.639
LIKE THIS I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:07.974
LIKE SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BUT I IN

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:09.609
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT I HAVEN'T

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:11.010
HEARD.

01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:14.347
THOSE EXAMS DOCTOR WILBUR MY NO

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:17.450
THAT'LL BE AFFORDED WHICH WAS A

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:18.918
WAY TO FUND LONG TERM CARE

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:20.453
INSURANCE.

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.988
IT WAS THE FIRST THING TO GO

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:25.291
BECAUSE THE THE NUMBERS DIDN'T

01:54:25.358 --> 01:54:26.859
WORK AL THAT WELL.

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.728
SO AGAIN I THINK THIS.

01:54:28.795 --> 01:54:32.298
THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE AND ONE

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.600
OTHER THING IS THAT.

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:35.401
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ENSURE

01:54:35.468 --> 01:54:37.837
AGAINST FACILITY PLACEMENT OF SO

01:54:37.904 --> 01:54:39.505
THE PRODUCT NEEDS.

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:41.608
TO INCLUDE HOME COMMUNITY BASED

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:43.810
SERVICES BUT HOW MUCH DO THOSE

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:46.279
COSTS IN HALF HOW DO YOU MANAGE

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:48.047
THAT SO I WISH I COULD.

01:54:48.114 --> 01:54:50.483
BE MORE HOPEFUL AND SAY YEP --

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:53.152
MINNESOTA DOESN'T HERE'S HOW IT

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:56.422
IS IT WORKS GREAT BUT WELL WE

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:57.890
LIVE THE GOLDEN STATE AND I

01:54:57.957 --> 01:55:00.360
THINK OUR OUR OUR OUR CITIZENS

01:55:00.426 --> 01:55:02.295
WHEN THEY REACH THEIR GOLDEN AGE.

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:02.829
SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:06.266
DIGNITY AND IN CASE OF AND AND

01:55:06.332 --> 01:55:08.067
NOT HAVE TO TO WORRY --

01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:09.202
WHERE THE RENT CHECKS AND COME

01:55:09.269 --> 01:55:10.169
FROM WHERE THEY'RE?

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:11.271
WERE THERE OTHER MONEY FOR THE

01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:12.639
MEDICATIONS GOING TO COME FROM

01:55:12.705 --> 01:55:14.107
THEIR FOOD --

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.975
SO YOU KNOW.

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:20.480
I'M I'M SOME TYPE OF A MASTER

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:21.781
PLAN THEY THEY GIVE SAID

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:23.082
ASSURANCES SO --

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:24.617
CEDARS CAN LIVE IN PEACE.

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:26.352
AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE IN THEIR

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:27.387
AND THEIR GOAL AND THEIR GOOD

01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:29.889
YEARS WHEN EXPOSED TO BE

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:30.523
ENJOYING THEIR LIVES.

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.858
I WILL TAKE THIS BACK TO MY

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.192
COLLEAGUES AND SEE I'M SURE

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:34.827
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:36.562
MISSED AND IF I FIND SOMETHING

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:38.798
THAT'S PROMISING I'LL MAKE IT

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.867
AVAILABLE THANK YOU --

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.535
SO I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE --

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:44.103
HEARING THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING

01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:45.571
THAT ACTUALLY --

01:55:45.638 --> 01:55:47.573
FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A BILL --

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.809
TO LOOK AT IN ACTUAL ANALYSIS IN

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:51.344
FACT AND WE ALSO HAVE A BUDGET

01:55:51.411 --> 01:55:53.112
PROPOSAL INVESTMENT WE'RE GONNA

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:54.514
HERE LATER ON TODAY.

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:56.983
THAT LOOKS AT THIS VERY ISSUE SO

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.884
IT'S ASKING FOR A BUT A JAZZ

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.819
ALLOCATION TO DO A FEASIBILITY

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:02.121
ACTUAR ANALYSIS OF BASICALLY

01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:03.423
FINING FINANCE YOU'LL TO SUPPORT

AROUND A LONG TERM CARE.

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:09.562
AND SO FORTH SO --

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:12.332
I REALIZE IT'S A TOUGH NOT IT'S

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:14.100
ONE THAT WE WANT TO TRY TAKE ON

01:56:14.167 --> 01:56:15.501
SO THAT --

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:17.370
WE CAN HELP THE THEIR SUPPORT --

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.938
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:19.605
STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:21.341
RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT OPTION IS

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.509
SPEND DOWN ON MEDI CAL AIMED AT

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:27.013
THAT THAT SAID AND TWITTER.

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:27.947
ESSENTIALLY THE STATE IS PAYING

YOU KNOW FOR AT A GOOD JOHNNY ON

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:31.918
THE HALF IN THE FEDERAL AND ITS

IT'S AND BASICALLY.

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:35.188
WE EXPECT FAMILIES TO DRIVE

01:56:35.254 --> 01:56:36.622
HIMSELF IN THE POVERTY FIRST.

01:56:36.689 --> 01:56:37.690
AND THEN --

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:41.994
AND AND THAT AND THEN WE BUT IN

WHEN WE WERE TRYING --

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:46.532
TO GROW STRAIGHT CREEL OPTIONS

01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:48.568
SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS IS

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:49.969
ATION SO ANYTHING WE LOOK THE

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:52.071
MASTER PLAN WILL LOOK AT THESE

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:53.339
WELL LOOK SAID FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:54.640
THE VISION IS AND I APPRECIATE

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.209
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAYING.

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.543
RIGHT SO WHAT WHAT IS A WHAT WE

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.011
WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THEN

01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:00.246
THINK ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:01.881
GETTING THERE CERTAINLY THIS IS

01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:03.282
ONE THE STEPS WHILE LOOK AT IS

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:05.251
HOW CAN WE HELP.

01:57:05.318 --> 01:57:06.686
BETTER --

01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:11.758
FINANCING OPTIONS THAT --

01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:15.161
WORK FOR OKAY S. FAN YOU CAN

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:16.896
HAVE SELF SELECTION AT EIGHT

01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:17.864
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO SAY WE CAN

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.365
ONLY DEPEND ON THE PEOPLE WHO

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:20.733
THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.502
THEM SO.

01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:25.405
FAR WE HAVE TO LOOK AT NINE ONE

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.239
ONE MORE THING.

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:27.340
SO -- IT

01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:28.508
USED TO BE THAT YOU HAVE A CUTE

01:57:28.574 --> 01:57:30.476
PRIMARY CARE AND LONG TERM

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:31.978
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND YOU

01:57:32.044 --> 01:57:33.679
SEE THOSE COMING TOGETHER AND WE

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.815
SEE WAYS THAT WE CAN SAVE ON THE

01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:37.417
ACUTE CARE SIDE OF COURSE.

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:38.785
THAT'S MEDICARE --

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.553
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOME

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.954
REALLY GOOD WORK COMING OUT OF

01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:43.089
BROWN THAT SHOWS THAT.

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:44.924
HOME DELIVER NUTRITION PROGRAMS

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:46.225
SAVE HOSPITALIZATIONS.

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:48.161
SO IT'S SORT OF THINKING ABOUT

01:57:48.227 --> 01:57:50.696
WHERE ARE THE DOLLARS THAT COULD

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.165
BE DEVOTED IF WE HAD.

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:55.368
A BETTER INTEGRATION OF FUNDING

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:58.938
TO SUPPORT OF LONG TERM SERVICES

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.807
AND SUPPORTS.

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:02.341
QUESTION SENATOR TADA YES MISTER

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:04.710
CHAIR.

01:58:04.777 --> 01:58:06.512
SO A MISMATCH I WAS JUST TRYING

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:07.680
TO GET A CENTER NAY MENTION THE

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:09.282
THREE STEPS --

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:11.617
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON DO YOU

01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:14.320
HAVE A SENSE OF TIME OF WHEN YOU.

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:17.056
CAN PLAN ON COMPLETING THIS OR

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:18.724
IF IT'S JUST AN ONGOING THING

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:20.026
JUST WANT TO GET MORE OF AN

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:21.694
UNDERSTANDING OF OF WHAT THAT

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:22.728
LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:24.397
GREAT QUESTION I THINK THE THE

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:25.364
THINGS THAT I OUTLINED OR THINGS

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.098
THAT ARE IN.

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:28.000
PROGRESS NOW WE HAVE TO MOVE

01:58:28.067 --> 01:58:30.970
QUICKLY THE GOVERNOR HAS --

01:58:31.037 --> 01:58:31.571
HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:34.874
HAVE THIS IS NOT ACT.

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.409
THE MULTI YEAR EFFORT THIS HAS

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:38.377
TO HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY SO I

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:39.645
THINK WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:40.613
WEEKS AND MONTHS WE WILL BE

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.981
ENGAGING BOTH STAKEHOLDERS

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:43.516
LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS. TO

01:58:43.583 --> 01:58:45.251
REALLY THINK THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:45.985
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.753
LIKE AND IT CAN BE A DRAWN OUT

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.223
PROCESS THAT TAKES YEARS IT HAS

01:58:50.289 --> 01:58:52.191
TO BE WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY ON

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:55.261
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:56.796
AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.064
YOU FOR BEING HERE I DO WANT TO

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.499
ACKNOWLEDGE AND MAKE NOTE OF THE

01:58:59.565 --> 01:59:01.200
WORK THAT --

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:03.135
FORMER SERIK CAROL LOU DID --

01:59:03.202 --> 01:59:04.437
SHE HAS SELECT COMMITTEE ON

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.272
AGING I THINK SHE PRODUCED THIS

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:07.540
CHART WHICH SHOWED ALL THE

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:09.208
VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OUT

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:10.276
ONE HAND YOU GO LOOK AT IT YOU

01:59:10.343 --> 01:59:11.644
SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:13.012
AT THE OTHER HAND.

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:13.913
THERE'S A LOT MISSING ELEMENTS

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:14.480
RIGHT.

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:16.449
AS WELL AND SO --

01:59:16.516 --> 01:59:18.117
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:24.290
FIGURE OUT HOW WE THE BILL

01:59:24.357 --> 01:59:25.625
DEVELOP A VISION AND THEN FIGURE

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:26.792
OUT HOW IT'S THAT SITTING THERE

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:27.460
SAYING WHAT SILOS DO WE HAVE AND

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:28.494
I THINK WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF

01:59:28.561 --> 01:59:29.962
THE CONVERSATION WE TALK ABOUT

01:59:30.029 --> 01:59:31.297
FARM AGING WE ARE BY AN S..

01:59:31.364 --> 01:59:32.798
P. AND RESIZE WHAT WE TALK ABOUT

01:59:32.865 --> 01:59:33.833
THIS PIECE BUT THERE'S A MEDI

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.501
CAL PIECE WHICH WILL BE HEARING

01:59:35.568 --> 01:59:37.470
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE LATER ON AND

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:38.538
AND THOSE.

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:39.906
TO MEET RIGHT AND BUT THEY'RE

01:59:39.972 --> 01:59:41.674
BEING HEARD DIFFERENT TIMES AND

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:45.177
SO FORTH SO --

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:48.281
ISN'T ACTUALLY DISPOSSESSED A

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:50.550
MASTER PLAN THAT'S GOOD --

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:54.253
THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE WE NEED

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.022
TO MOVE SPEEDILY ON THIS --

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.723
SO HOW HOW.

01:59:57.790 --> 02:00:00.526
HOW DO YOU TREAT THIS VISION FOR

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:04.330
IT IS EVIDENCE BASED VISION --

02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:05.298
FOR FOR AGING IN THE STATE OF

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.633
CALIFORNIA I MEAN IS THERE A

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.568
PARTICULAR --

02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:10.002
DEAL IS THERE A PARTICULAR STATE

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:11.804
OR OTHER NATION THAT WE LOOK AT

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:13.239
THAT IT'S DONE THAT BEFORE WE

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:14.707
PLOWING WE GOT TO BUILD THIS

02:00:14.774 --> 02:00:15.875
WE'RE PLOWING NEW GROUND FOR

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:17.610
CELLS I WAS WE HAVE UNITARY

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:18.711
CALIFORNIA CHARACTERISTICS AS

02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:19.745
WELL.

02:00:19.812 --> 02:00:20.746
HOW HOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION THE

02:00:20.813 --> 02:00:22.181
PROCESS FOR DOING THAT I

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:24.483
APPRECIATE THE SPEED PART BUT WE

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.318
ALSO HEARD ABOUT WE NEED TO

02:00:25.384 --> 02:00:26.586
ENGAGE?

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:28.154
THE THAT.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.655
THEY ON SENIORS WE NEED TO DO

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:34.527
REACHED THERE'S A PART THE STATE

02:00:34.594 --> 02:00:35.094
IT CETERA.

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:37.396
ALL THAT TAKES SOME TIME SO I

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:39.365
I'VE USED THE FINAL LAB RATE ON

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:39.999
WHETHER THERE'S EXISTING WORK

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:40.833
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUILD ON

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.069
AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF THE WORK

02:00:43.135 --> 02:00:44.470
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT

02:00:44.537 --> 02:00:46.572
FROM.

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:48.007
YEAH SO MAYBE I CAN START CENTER

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.508
I THINK YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:50.810
POINT I THINK THAT.

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.211
YOU REALLY --

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:54.847
OUR PROGRAMS ARE SILO IT BECAUSE

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:56.048
WE HAVE TO DO THAT AT A

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:57.650
NECESSITY BECAUSE GOVERNMENT

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:58.384
THAT'S HOW GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS

02:00:58.451 --> 02:00:59.285
BY.

02:00:59.352 --> 02:01:00.419
LIKE I NOTED THAT'S NOT HOW

02:01:00.486 --> 02:01:01.687
PEOPLE'S LIVES WORK AND SO WE

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.189
HAVE TO REALLY THINK

02:01:03.255 --> 02:01:04.323
HOLISTICALLY ABOUT.

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:06.158
IF PEOPLE ARE COMING TO OUR

02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:08.327
AGENCY AND COMING THROUGH FIVE

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.962
DIFFERENT OORS AND PROVIDING

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.497
THE SAME INFORMATION FIVE

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:12.665
DIFFERENT TIMES AS OUR MORE

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:15.101
INNOVATIVE WAY FOR US TO THINK

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:15.635
ABOUT HOW WE DELIVER THOSE

02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:17.003
SERVICES --

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:19.472
AND I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO

02:01:19.538 --> 02:01:20.172
PUT ON STEROIDS THAT

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:24.577
CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO PUT ON

02:01:24.644 --> 02:01:25.745
STEROIDS AND THINK REALLY

02:01:25.811 --> 02:01:26.345
THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE DO

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:26.679
THERE -- IN

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:27.780
TERMS OF THE MASTER PLAN I THINK

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:29.448
THERE IS BOTH STUFF THAT HAS

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.050
HAPPENED OR A WORK THAT HAS

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.752
HAPPENED BOTH WITHIN GOVERNMENT

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.053
AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT.

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:36.489
DR WILBUR'S WORK ON CARE GIVING

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:38.224
AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.191
DONE PHENOMENAL WORK ON THIS WE

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:41.293
HAVE TO BUILD ON TOP OF IT

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.028
THERE'S NO NEED TO RECREATE THE

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:42.628
WHEEL.

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:43.996
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:47.233
HAVE TO ESTABLISH METRICS THIS

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:48.601
ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT WE

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:50.836
HAVE TO ESTABLISH METRICS AROUND.

02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:52.571
THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.040
PERHAPS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:55.775
AND REALLY HOLD OURSELVES

02:01:55.841 --> 02:01:56.942
ACCOUNTABLE BOTH.

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:58.277
BROUGHT ON THE PRIVATE SIDE AND

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:00.179
THE PUBLIC SIDE TO SAY HOW ARE

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:01.681
WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS US

02:02:01.747 --> 02:02:02.848
METRICS --

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:03.716
AND SO I THINK PART OF THE

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:05.651
MASTER PLAN IS REALLY THINKING

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:09.088
ABOUT WHAT DOES --

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:10.056
HEALTHY AGING LOOK LIKE IN THE

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:11.691
STATE AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:13.059
FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:13.893
COAST.

02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:15.194
BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT A

02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:16.696
MORE HOLISTICALLY AND THEN SET

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.130
THOSE PARAMETERS SO THAT WE CAN

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.432
BE MEASURING TOWARDS THEM OVER

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:25.237
TIME.

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:25.738
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF IT'S

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:28.441
POSSIBLE THAT LONG TERM CARE BE

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:30.209
SOMEHOW.

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:32.211
PUT IN WITH MEDI CAL IS PART OF

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:34.013
THE IF THEY SIT DOWN AT THE

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.515
TABLE AND YOU KNOW UP.

02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:38.784
PUT IT IS PART OF THE MEDI CAL

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:41.320
BENEFITS SORE HOWEVER WASTE THE

02:02:41.387 --> 02:02:43.289
GOVERNMENT DOES IT.

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:44.557
IF NEEDED.

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.625
EVERYBODY'S NOT GONNA LIVE AND

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.527
WHEN YOU PAY INTO A LONG I HAD A

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:50.196
LONG TERM CARE POLICY WHEN I WAS

02:02:50.262 --> 02:02:51.931
YOUNG.

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:53.666
BUT YOU CAN'T COULD TOO BECAUSE

02:02:53.733 --> 02:02:57.002
I HAD THREE KIDS RIGHT.

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.270
AND MYSELF THE HOUSE TO COLLIDE

02:02:58.337 --> 02:02:59.171
IN.

02:02:59.238 --> 02:03:03.142

MONEY YOU PUT INTO A LONG TERM

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.147
CARE INSURANCE.

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.449
WHO IS A GO IS HIS GUN RIGHT?

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:10.950

02:03:11.016 --> 02:03:12.418
NOT.

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:13.319
GONE.

02:03:13.385 --> 02:03:15.254
YES WELL AT THE AGE THAT STOCK

02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:16.222
TO ENSURE ANY GOES INTO A POOL

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:17.690
WHICH THEN RIGHT --

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:20.459
SOME OF IT NAY VI YOU NEVER USE

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:21.994
IT.

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:23.062
RIGHT IF YOU DIE.

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:24.063
WHICH WE KNOW WILL YOU FEET IF

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:25.798
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO INTO A LONG

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:28.868
TERM CARE FACILITY THEN.

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.603
THAT IS THAT RIGHT WELL AT THE

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:32.705
THE WITHOUT GOING TO BED TO THE

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.774
BACK AND FORTH SO FIRST OF ALL --

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.041
THE AND ACTUALLY --

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:38.511
MEDI CAL THOSE GRAYSON WITH

02:03:38.577 --> 02:03:39.945
MEDICARE THAT WE WANT TO THINK

02:03:40.012 --> 02:03:40.880
ABOUT.

02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:42.848
BECAUSE FOR SENIORS MEDICARE

02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:43.949
STARTS OPINION IS BEING THE MAIN

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:46.619
PAYER FOR HEALTH CARE --

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:48.154
AND THEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.089
ABOUT INSURANCE.

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.023
YOU DO COUNT ON THE FACT THAT IF

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.892
YOU DO THAT IN AN INSURANCE POOL

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:53.993
THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:56.028
HAVE GREATER NEEDS EL AND SOME

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:57.329
PEOPLE OF LESSER NEEDS.

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:59.064
RIGHT AND WE DON'T KNOW AND AND

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.032
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT'S

02:04:00.099 --> 02:04:01.734
GOING TO BE BUT THAT YES I MEAN

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:02.868
YOU DO NEED A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:05.037
OF PEOPLE LEE DON'T NEED IT BUT

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:06.405
THEY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE THEY

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:07.039
DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:08.174
NEED IT --

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.276
AND THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO END UP

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:11.210
NEEDING AND THAT'S HOW YOU

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.478
AVERAGE THAT'S HOW YOU SOCIALIZE

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:13.979
AVERAGE OUT THE COSTS AMONGST

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:14.814
EVERYONE.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.215
RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE SO SECURITY

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:17.750
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:19.752
TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:22.221
YEAH THAT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:23.355
LEFT HE LIVES.

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:25.491
YET EVEN LIVE AS LONG THAT.

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:26.892
THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:28.194
FOR THE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER SO SO

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.428
ANYTIME WE TALK ABOUT INSURANCE

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:30.563
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:32.031
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW TO

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:32.965
WHAT DEGREE DO WE LIMIT THE

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:34.133
AMOUNT OF PROFITS OR OTHER TYPE

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.167
THING TO GET THE WORD OUT THE

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:35.367
POOL.

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.203
BUT YOU DO NEED TO PULL IN ORDER

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:38.771
TO MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE OTHERWISE

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:40.005
OTHERWISE EVERYONE'S BACK TO

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.941
PAYING FOR THEMSELVES RATE SO

02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:43.175
LOW I NEED DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE TO

02:04:43.242 --> 02:04:44.109
PAY FOR IT I DON'T NEED AT ALL

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.311
THEY DON'T PAY FOR IT AND THEN.

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:51.450
THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT PEOPLE

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:52.551
CAN'T AFFORD.

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:53.052
YEAH MOST PEOPLE AREN'T

02:04:53.118 --> 02:04:53.853
MINNESOTA FINANCIAL POSITION TO

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:54.753
PAY FOR ALL THEIR LONG TERM CARE

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.021
THEMSELVES WE DON'T FIND A WAY

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:57.523
TO CREATE A POOL.

02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:59.191
SORRY FOR THE LONG TALKED BUT

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.259
NOW YOU SAY.

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:01.360
LONG TERM CARE IS IT IT IS PART

02:05:01.427 --> 02:05:01.994
OF MEDI CAL WE THAT'S CERTAINLY

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.062
A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR MEDI

02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:04.897
CAL BUDGETS PAYING FOR LONG TERM

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:06.298
CARE AND ALSO OF COURSE WE'RE

02:05:06.365 --> 02:05:07.600
GOING TO TALK ABOUT AYE HSS

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:09.034
TODAY AND OTHER.

02:05:09.101 --> 02:05:10.569
SO WE DO HAVE WE DO PAY THROUGH

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:12.137
MEDIC HOW FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES

02:05:12.204 --> 02:05:12.972
HOPEFULLY MANY OF THEM WE

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:14.540
ACTUALLY WANT TO SUPPORT MORE

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:15.708
BECAUSE THEY KEEP PEOPLE IN

02:05:15.774 --> 02:05:16.775
THEIR HOMES AND OUT OF THE

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:19.278
INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:19.545
EXPENSIVE.

02:05:19.612 --> 02:05:22.748
YES.

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.416
QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:26.485
THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING I THINK

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:28.087
THE DEPUTY SECRETARY IS OUTLINED

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:29.822
SOME REALLY NICE STEPS AND I

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:31.557
WOULD ENCOURAGE IS COMPONENT TO

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:31.924
THAT.

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:33.659
MAKING SURE WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:35.227
AT THE TABLE.

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:36.528
AND WE NEED TO THINK OF THAT I

02:05:36.595 --> 02:05:40.366
THINK WE NEED TO PRIVATE PUBLIC

02:05:40.432 --> 02:05:43.135
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BUT ALSO THE

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:44.503
FEDERAL FUNDING SIDE THE STATE

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:46.005
FUNDING SIDE AND LOCAL FUNDING

02:05:46.071 --> 02:05:48.674
SITE WHICH IS A HUGE PIECE OF IT.

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:51.243
SO THAT SHOULD BE PART OF IT --

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.778
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT.

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:54.313
THIS NEEDS TO BE A LIVING PLAN

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:56.248
AND EVOLVING PLAN BECAUSE WE'RE

02:05:56.315 --> 02:05:57.816
NOT GOING TO GET IT RIGHT IN A

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:58.751
YEAR.

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.286
OR EVEN TWO YEARS IT'S WAY TOO

02:06:00.352 --> 02:06:01.887
HARD TO DO THAT.

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.188
AND SO MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:06.025
GREAT PROJECTS THAT NEVER LAUNCH

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.027
BECAUSE WE SPEND ALL THIS TIME

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:09.528
TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT.

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:11.330
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.599
WE DO MAKE TIME OF THE ESSENCE

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:15.601
AND PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE WITH

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:17.870
THE ADMISSION UP FRONT THAT THIS

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:19.672
IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE BUT

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.308
WE NEED TO START TAKING ACTION.

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.209
IF WE MAKE IT ACCOUNTABLE THEN

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.177
THOSE CORRECTIONS AND THAT

02:06:25.244 --> 02:06:26.845
EVOLUTION WILL NATURALLY BE

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:28.447
BUILT INTO IT SO RELEASE A

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:30.683
SIMPLE TO DO THAT BUT I JUST

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:31.550
WANT TO URGE THAT THE IMPORTANT

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:35.120
THING IS WE DO SOMETHING.

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:37.323
NOT WAIT FOR PERFECTION.

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:40.259
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:41.794

THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE --

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:47.766
IS IS THAT --

02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:20.071
DOLLARS.

02:16:20.138 --> 02:16:21.606
OKAY SO THAT'S A HUNDRED

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:22.173
THOUSAND FOR THE SALARY AND

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.308
BENEFITS QUESTION RIGHT AND THEN

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:25.043
THERE'S I ASSUME THERE'S MORE

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:27.746
BECAUSETHERE'S ALL THIS CONTEST.

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.548
THE CPS SERVICES RIGHT BECAUSE

02:16:29.614 --> 02:16:32.083
ALL I PROFESSIONALS CC NPS

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.351
SERVICES.

02:16:33.418 --> 02:16:34.252
IS.

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:34.419
SO.

02:16:34.486 --> 02:16:38.056
I HAVE A TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:40.191
BUDGET --

02:16:40.258 --> 02:16:41.192
THAT.

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:43.762
I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THAT OR

02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:44.729
YOU MAY WANT TO VIEW IT YEAH SO

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.164
SO SO SO I GUESS I GUESS THE

02:16:46.231 --> 02:16:48.133
COURT I AM SURE YET PAD FOR APPS

02:16:48.199 --> 02:16:49.534
WITHOUT GAIN. TOO MUCH INTO THE

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:52.671
WEEDS BECAUSE OF OF IS IS THAT.

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:53.905
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:56.641
ISSUES IS THE FIXED COSTS

02:16:56.708 --> 02:16:58.610
RELATED TO CENTURY THIS THE

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:00.145
CONSOLIDATED PROFESSIONAL

02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:01.479
SERVICES STRAIGHT.

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:03.248
PORTION OF THE BUDGET RIGHT AND

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:05.383
THAT PARTS GROWING CORRECT

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.485
BECAUSE THE RED CAR.

02:17:07.552 --> 02:17:11.389
AND SO I GUESS WITH.

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:13.592
AND I REALIZE THAT THEY ALSO WAS

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:15.794
ONE STAFF PERSON.

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:16.928
IT IS SO IT SO LICENSE THAT'S AN

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.129
AVERAGE STEPS --

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.064
THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:20.231
CALCULATED AND SERVE AVERAGES

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:22.100
ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:23.835
DEPENDING ON HOW BIG THEY ARTS

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:24.869
ADDRESS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:25.604
THIS.

02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:28.473
THIS RATE THE C. AND P. S. RATE

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:29.474
FOR FOR THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE

02:17:29.541 --> 02:17:31.076
IN HOUSE AT CONTRAST WITH

02:17:31.142 --> 02:17:31.743
SETTING IT.

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:33.745
FOR OTHER OTHER AGENCIES AND SO

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:34.613
FORTH.

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:35.647
SO THIS IS --

02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:37.315
A UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:17:37.382 --> 02:17:38.316
GENERAL SERVICES ALL THE

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:40.752
CONTRACTED FISCAL UNIT AND THE

02:17:40.819 --> 02:17:43.488
SMALLER ENTITIES LIKE THE SENIOR

02:17:43.555 --> 02:17:46.524
LEGISLATURE RIGHT EXPENSIVE THEY

02:17:46.591 --> 02:17:47.993
CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.861
GENERAL SERVICES AND I'M NOT

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:51.196
FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY HOW THOSE

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:52.497
RATES ARE SET SO I HAVE TO WORK

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:53.865
WITH MY TGS COLLEAGUES ON

02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:55.300
FINANCE --

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:56.801
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.436
FACTUALLY SPEAKING OVER THE PAST

02:17:58.503 --> 02:17:59.738
FEW YEARS.

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.072
AND SO THAT THE HAS BEEN A

02:18:01.139 --> 02:18:02.741
PRESSURE AND THEN JUST THE STAFF

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:05.143
PERSON I THINK MAINLY FOCUSES ON

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:06.378
JUST DAY TO DAY TASKS AND ALSO

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:08.079
THE MODEL LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:09.414
I DON'T KNOW IF.

02:18:09.481 --> 02:18:10.915
IF HE PERSON IS THE EXPERIENCE

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:12.751
WITH THE TIME TO ALSO TAKE ON

02:18:12.817 --> 02:18:14.152
THE ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS IN THE

02:18:14.219 --> 02:18:15.754
BUDGETARY FUNCTION VIA IN A GOOD

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.188
AND NOT SO MUCH SAYING THAT

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:17.756
THOSE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:19.290
SHIFTED TO THE ONE STAFF PERSON

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:20.759
BECAUSE AFTER THEY REQUIRE

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:22.227
MULTIPLE SKILL SETS.

02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:23.795
I GUESS THE QUESTION I'D HAVE

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:25.697
AND IT AND I CERTAINLY

02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:27.165
UNDERSTAND DETAILS CHALLENGE FOR

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:29.534
DTS KISSER THE TO TO ASSESS EACH

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:30.969
INDIVIDUAL SMALL AGENCY AND SEE

02:18:31.036 --> 02:18:32.871
WHAT I MEAN LEGAL SERVICES DOES

THAT AGENCY REALLY NEEDS I'M

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:35.306
JUST THINKING LIKE.

02:18:35.373 --> 02:18:37.175
THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE TYPE OF

02:18:37.242 --> 02:18:38.677
ACTIVITIES ENGAGE IN OBVIOUSLY

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:40.445
YOU NEED SOME BASIC A COUNTY YOU

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:41.546
NEED SOME BASICALLY YOU'LL

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:42.814
SERVICES BUT I MEAN ARE THEY IN

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:43.848
A POSITION WHERE THEY GET SUED

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:45.083
ALIVE -- THE

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.252
A LOT OF LEGAL SERVICES IT'S

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.020
ADDRESS I'M JUST AND AND AND I

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:50.588
IT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT DEL

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:52.991
AT THAT THAT'S WORK FOR D. G. S.

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:54.225
M. INTERNET THEY MAY NOT WHAT IT

02:18:54.292 --> 02:18:55.126
MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO GO

02:18:55.193 --> 02:18:56.795
THROUGH AGENCY BY AGENCY AGENCY

02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:58.029
TO FIGURE OUT WHILE.

02:18:58.096 --> 02:18:59.731
THEY MAY VARY FROM ONE THE ONE

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:00.699
SO THEY JUST SAY OKAY WELL THIS

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:02.367
IS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE POOL WE

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:03.201
SPEND WE JUST DIVVIED UP.

02:19:03.268 --> 02:19:04.636
FOUND SOME PROPORTION BASED ON

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:06.271
HOW BIG THEY ARE BUT I'M JUST

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:06.871
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THERE'S

02:19:06.938 --> 02:19:07.972
SOME WAY.

02:19:08.039 --> 02:19:09.140
TO GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE WORK

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:17.816
THEY DO TO GET. TO DEAL WITH THE

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.552
C. AND P. S. A LOT OF THE

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:23.121
SERVICING ITSELF.

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:24.989
NOW THE ACCOUNT AND A LAWYER AND

02:19:25.056 --> 02:19:26.658
EVERYTHING ELSE BUT AT SO I KNOW

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.026
THERE'S SOME.

02:19:28.093 --> 02:19:28.893
WAY WE COULD WORK WITH THAT OR

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.595
NOT WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.130
MAJORITY OF EXPENSES UNDER

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.498
ACCOUNTING AND SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:19:33.565 --> 02:19:35.333
ALL THE MEMBERS WHEN THEY FLY

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:36.968
OKAY SO THAT'S ALL THEY DO ALL

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:39.404
THE REIMBURSEMENTS AND IT'S I

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:40.839
THINK THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF THE

02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:42.741
WORK LOAD BUT THE SPECIFIC.

02:19:42.807 --> 02:19:46.144
CALCULATIONS AT TGS YOU CHARGE

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:47.212
I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH.

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:47.912
AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:51.015
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:51.816
TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND I

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:53.485
REALIZE THIS VERY CONVERSATION

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:54.452
WITH THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:55.987
MEMBERS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:19:56.054 --> 02:19:57.856
WAYS.

02:19:57.922 --> 02:19:59.257
TO ADDRESS OF THIS COSTS IN A

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:01.159
WAY THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE COUNTY

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:02.093
OVERHEAD LIKE I DON'T KNOW I

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.628
MEAN I I I I I DON'T WANT TO

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:04.162
TELL YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:05.363
ORGANIZATION BUT IT'S KIND OF

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:06.698
LIKE OKAY WE JUST DO PER DIEM IS

02:20:06.765 --> 02:20:08.199
WE DON'T DO REIMBURSEMENT.

02:20:08.266 --> 02:20:10.435
SO THEREFORE IT'S IT OUT WITHOUT

02:20:10.502 --> 02:20:11.703
HAVING TO GO PROJECT REVIEW ALL

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.037
THESE RECEIPTS AND SO FORTH I

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:14.572
HAVE NO IDEA SO.

02:20:14.639 --> 02:20:16.341
I THINK THAT THE DIFFICULTY THAT

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:20.078
WE WE WE RUN INTO WITH THIS IS

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:22.180
THAT I MEAN THEY'RE STILL WALK.

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:24.616
RIGHT RIGHT SO SO TO THE EXTENT.

02:20:24.682 --> 02:20:27.685
WE YOU KNOW IF IF IF THIS THE

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:29.854
THE CFS WASN'T YOU KNOW SERVICES

02:20:29.921 --> 02:20:31.489
WEREN'T CHARGED.

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:34.292
TO THE AGENCIES THAT UTILIZE

02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:38.229
THOSE SERVICES SO AS A RIGHT SO

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.165
SO IT'S REALLY JUST YOU KNOW

02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:41.499
YOU'RE TAKING FROM ONE IN BUT

02:20:41.566 --> 02:20:42.901
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO.

02:20:42.967 --> 02:20:44.435
PUT THE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE SO

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:46.771
IT IT BECOMES AND THEN WHEN

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:48.239
YOU'RE YOU KNOW.

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:49.374
CELLS DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.142
AGENCY THEY ARE SMALL --

02:20:51.209 --> 02:20:53.812
AGENCY BUT WE WE CAN LOOK INTO

02:20:53.878 --> 02:20:56.214
HOW THE DETERMINATION IS MADE

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.415
WHAT THOSE CFOS.

02:20:57.482 --> 02:20:58.583
ARE HOW THOSE COSTS ARE

02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:00.885
ALLOCATED AMONGST THE TO

THERE'S LIKE.

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:09.260
A IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.996
AMOUNT OF OF WORKLOAD THAT --

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:14.299

SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW THAT

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:20.271
WORKS UNFORTUNATELY --

02:21:20.338 --> 02:21:21.940
YEAH WE WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO

THAT'S A A OF CHEAPER COST

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:14.412
STRUCTURE YEAR CYBERSECURITY

OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:27.225
BEEN A CHRONIC ISSUE THAT COMES

02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:27.725
UP.

02:24:27.792 --> 02:24:32.630
NOW EVERY YEAR EVERY TIME WE SO

02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:36.634
THAT ALLOWS ME TO SEGUE TO THE

02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:38.336
NICELY YES THAT'S SOMETHING I

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:40.004

TO THE REQUEST FOR A CONTINUOUS

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:46.077
FUNDING --

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:47.311
THE THREE YEAR PLAN NOT ONLY

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:48.846
IDENTIFY THE CHALLENGES FACING

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:50.815
CSL AND OUTLINED A SOLUTION AS

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:51.682
WELL.

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:53.518
IT INVOLVED A TWO PRONGED FUNDED

02:24:53.584 --> 02:24:55.653
APPROACH THAT INVOLVED FUNDING

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:58.656
OF THE ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND WE

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:00.758
REFER TO IT AS ADVOCACY NOT

02:25:00.825 --> 02:25:01.626
LOBBYING.

02:25:01.692 --> 02:25:04.762
K. ARE LOBBYING REQUIRES

02:25:04.829 --> 02:25:07.565
REGISTRATION ALL THAT KIND OF

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:07.832
EFFORT --

02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:11.269
AND IT CAN FOR TAX PURPOSES IF

02:25:11.335 --> 02:25:12.837
WE WERE A NON PROFIT --

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:15.440
WE'D BE IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY.

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:18.109
AS WELL SO ANYWAY.

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:20.144
AND ALSO THEN FUNDING COSTS

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:21.913
INVOLVING ADMINISTRATION OF THE

02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:23.314
STATE AGENCY.

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:25.183
USING GENERAL FUND THIS.

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:26.551
SO YOU HAVE A TWO TIERED FUNDING

02:25:26.617 --> 02:25:29.120
PROGRAMMING YOU'VE BASICALLY.

02:25:29.187 --> 02:25:30.655
FIRE WALL IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:32.723
THE OF THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AND

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:35.560
THE AND THE ADVOCACY PIECE.

02:25:35.626 --> 02:25:36.861
OF THE REQUEST FOR AN ONGOING

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:39.730
APPROPRIATIONS FOUR HUNDRED

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:40.398
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT JUMPED

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:41.933
FROM OUR PREVIOUS YEAR BUDGET IS

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:44.569
TO TRIP IT MAINLY. TO THE CYBER

02:25:44.635 --> 02:25:46.971
AUDIT EXPENSE.

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:49.440
AND AS OUR TWENTY NINETEEN

02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:51.709
TWENTY BUDGET NOTES 76% OF OUR

02:25:51.776 --> 02:25:52.610
COSTS.

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:54.345
INVOLVED SOVEREIGN BENEFITS

02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:56.981
STATE FEES.

02:25:57.048 --> 02:26:00.017
AND CITY T. AUDIT EXPERTS.

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:01.319
AS A FIRM REMINDER.

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:06.457
THE SALARY AND BENEFITS INVOLVED.

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:08.593
A STATE EMPLOYEE BEING ASKED TO

02:26:08.659 --> 02:26:10.761
THEIR SALARY BENEFITS TO BE

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:12.296
FUNDED OUT OF DONATIONS.

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:13.431
IN MY MIND THERE'S SOMETHING

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:14.966
WRONG WITH THAT.

02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:15.867
OKAY -- THE

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.101
PROBABLY THE SAVING GRACE AT

02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:19.003
THIS POINT IS THAT AN EMPLOYEE

02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:20.905
IS NOT A UNION.

02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:22.673
PERSON THERE ARE MANAGEMENT.

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.776
INDIVIDUAL SO BUT STILL THE

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:27.044
QUESTION IN MY MIND IS AND I

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:28.513
THINK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASK HOW

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:29.647
DO YOU FUND.

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.149
A STATE EMPLOYEE OUT OF

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:31.816
DONATIONS [inaudible]

02:26:31.883 --> 02:26:34.685
OUR SO [inaudible]

02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:36.754
IN CLOSING.

02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:39.157
I THINK THE THREE YEAR PLAN HAS

02:26:39.223 --> 02:26:41.559
IDENTIFIED A FUNDING APPROACH.

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:42.827
THAT ALLOWS FOR THE A STATE

02:26:42.894 --> 02:26:45.463
AGENCY. TO FIND OUT OF THE

02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:46.998
GENERAL FUND CERTAIN

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:48.900
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:50.701
WITH THE STATE THAT ARE CHARGED

02:26:50.768 --> 02:26:51.602
TO BASICALLY.

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:53.304
MOST AGENCIES OF NOT ALL AGES

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.805
LIKE OUR OWN.

02:26:54.872 --> 02:26:57.108
AND THEN FOR THE ADVOCACY PIECE

02:26:57.175 --> 02:26:59.844
INVOLVING OUR LEGISLATOR VISITS

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:01.412
OUR ANNUAL SESSION SENT. TO BE

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:02.613
FUNDED OUT OF IT HAS BEEN

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.149
TRADITIONALLY FUNDED OUT OF THE

02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:07.251
TAX CHECK OFF.

02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:08.920

TO BASICALLY ARE SORT OF MOST

03:08:56.158 --> 03:08:57.993
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN.

03:08:58.060 --> 03:08:59.528
AND THAT IS --

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:01.263

JUST VOLUME --

03:09:02.798 --> 03:09:03.665
WE LEARNED MANY LESSONS FROM

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:04.866
IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE

03:09:04.933 --> 03:09:05.967
ACT -- SOME

03:09:06.034 --> 03:09:07.869
OF WHICH WE'VE ANTICIPATED THAT

03:09:07.936 --> 03:09:09.104
WON'T HAPPEN --

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:11.173
AUTOMATION IS IN PLACE THE STATE

03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:12.908
RULES HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND HAVE

COME TO US WITH SUFFICIENT LEAD

03:09:14.509 --> 03:09:15.610
TIME -- BUT

03:09:15.677 --> 03:09:16.812
WE ALSO REALIZE FROM THE

03:09:16.878 --> 03:09:18.113
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT WHEN

03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:19.848
YOU HAVE A VOLUME THAT FAR

03:09:19.915 --> 03:09:21.416
EXCEEDS WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE --

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:22.484
IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR

03:09:22.551 --> 03:09:24.019
CLIENTS AND IN THIS CASE OR SOME

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:25.120
OF THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN

03:09:25.187 --> 03:09:26.822
THE AND SOCIETY.

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:28.056
THAT LEADS --

03:09:28.123 --> 03:09:31.760
TO A CW WE'RE REQUESTING FIFTEEN

03:09:31.827 --> 03:09:33.595
POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND

03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:34.796
WHICH IS AND SORT OF TWO

03:09:34.863 --> 03:09:36.164
COMPONENTS.

03:09:36.231 --> 03:09:37.432
THE FIRST IS FIVE POINT THREE

03:09:37.499 --> 03:09:39.835
MILLION ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR

03:09:39.901 --> 03:09:41.336
APPLICATION VOLUME.

03:09:41.403 --> 03:09:43.405
THE BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING FOR

03:09:43.472 --> 03:09:44.873
NEW CASES.

03:09:44.940 --> 03:09:46.141
THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE

03:09:46.208 --> 03:09:48.977
FUNDING --

03:09:49.044 --> 03:09:50.145
FOR THE ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED

03:09:50.212 --> 03:09:51.546
AND TWELVE FOR ABOUT THREE

03:09:51.613 --> 03:09:53.782
HUNDRED SEVENTY CASES --

03:09:53.849 --> 03:09:54.316
WE EXPECT THE VOLUME OF

03:09:54.382 --> 03:09:55.951
APPLICANTS WILL BE MUCH HIGHER

03:09:56.017 --> 03:09:58.086
THAN THAT COULD BE TRIPLE --

03:09:58.153 --> 03:10:00.055
AND WE ARE REQUESTING ONE TIME

03:10:00.122 --> 03:10:01.656
FUNDING SO WE CAN PROCESSES

03:10:01.723 --> 03:10:03.158
APPLICATIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE

03:10:03.225 --> 03:10:05.327
VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WAITING

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:07.496
LONG PERIODS OF TIME MORE HAVING

03:10:07.562 --> 03:10:08.597
LONG LINES.

03:10:10.232 --> 03:10:11.700

THE SECOND PART OF THE REQUEST

03:10:13.068 --> 03:10:14.603
IS TEN POINT ONE MILLION FOR

03:10:14.669 --> 03:10:16.238
ONGOING FUNDING.

03:10:16.304 --> 03:10:18.006
THE STATE IN THE COUNTIES DID

03:10:18.073 --> 03:10:20.575
AGREE LAST YEAR TO AN ASSUMPTION

03:10:20.642 --> 03:10:21.610
ABOUT WORKLOAD FOR THE NEW CASES.

03:10:21.676 --> 03:10:23.311
THEIR NEW WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

03:10:23.378 --> 03:10:24.479
WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BUT FOR

03:10:24.546 --> 03:10:26.148
BETTER OR FOR WORSE WE CAME TO A

03:10:26.214 --> 03:10:27.282
A GOOD.

03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:29.117
A GOOD UNDERSTANDING --

03:10:29.184 --> 03:10:30.786
THE BUDGET HOWEVER FUNDS THAT

03:10:30.852 --> 03:10:34.689
WORKLOAD AT TWO THOUSAND TWO

03:10:34.756 --> 03:10:37.959
THOUSAND ONE COSTS.

03:10:38.026 --> 03:10:39.060
SO THAT THE UNIT COST THE COST

03:10:39.127 --> 03:10:39.928
OF THE WORKER THE COST OF THE

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:40.962
BUILDING THE OVER HAD.

03:10:41.029 --> 03:10:42.898
IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM HAS NOT

03:10:42.964 --> 03:10:45.867
BEEN UPDATED SINCE.

03:10:45.934 --> 03:10:46.468
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE

03:10:46.535 --> 03:10:47.602
AND SO INFLATION AND HAS

03:10:47.669 --> 03:10:50.305
PROBABLY ERODED MAYBE 40% OF

03:10:50.372 --> 03:10:52.174
THAT SO THE BUDGET ACTUALLY ONLY

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:54.209
FUND 60% OF THE WORK THAT WE

03:10:54.276 --> 03:10:54.976
AGREED.

03:10:55.043 --> 03:10:55.944
COUNTIES NEED TO DO AND AND

03:10:56.011 --> 03:10:59.748
THAT'S A VAST SESSION ERA.

03:10:59.815 --> 03:11:01.917
A YOU KNOW A BY GONE ERA OF HOW

03:11:01.983 --> 03:11:03.084
THE STATE MANAGED ITS BUDGET IN

03:11:03.151 --> 03:11:06.955
A KIND OF A STATE COUNTY --

03:11:07.022 --> 03:11:08.857
ENGAGEMENT IT REALLY DOESN'T

03:11:08.924 --> 03:11:10.892
REFLECT WHERE WE ALL ARE IN

03:11:10.959 --> 03:11:12.027
TERMS OF PARTNERSHIP.

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:13.328
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET THIS

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:14.696
THIS IMPLEMENTED AND SO WE'D

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:16.064
REQUEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

03:11:16.131 --> 03:11:18.400
UPDATE THE UNIT COST. TO CURRENT

03:11:18.466 --> 03:11:19.034
COST SINCE IT IS

03:11:19.100 --> 03:11:20.769
INCONTROVERTIBLE A NOT TOO

03:11:20.836 --> 03:11:23.104
THOUSAND TODAY.

03:11:23.171 --> 03:11:24.172

COMMENTS FROM AGENCY ABOUT WHAT

03:11:29.244 --> 03:11:31.379
SAID BEEN PRESENTED [inaudible]

03:11:31.446 --> 03:11:33.081
OKAY ALEJO [inaudible]

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:36.685
FINANCE --

03:11:36.751 --> 03:11:37.886
WORDS PER MINUTE FINANCE I THINK

03:11:37.953 --> 03:11:40.188
WE WOULD JUST SAY FOR A COUPLE

03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:42.490
OF THESE ISSUES WERE OBVIOUSLY

03:11:42.557 --> 03:11:44.059
WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH

03:11:44.125 --> 03:11:45.427
STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE

03:11:45.493 --> 03:11:46.995
THE EXTENT THESE BECOME

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:48.730
PRIORITIES --

03:11:48.797 --> 03:11:49.998
AND WE'RE OPEN ONGOING

03:11:50.065 --> 03:11:52.067
DISCUSSION HOWEVER NOW THESE

03:11:52.133 --> 03:11:54.135
WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

03:11:54.202 --> 03:11:55.704
BUDGET OKAY BUT I WOULD PRESUME

03:11:55.770 --> 03:11:57.105
THOUGH THAT IMPLEMENTING CASH

03:11:57.172 --> 03:12:00.442
OUT IS A PRIORITY OF THE BUDGET

03:12:00.508 --> 03:12:01.943
RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOES.

03:12:02.010 --> 03:12:02.577
SO THAT.

03:12:02.644 --> 03:12:04.179
THE SUGGESTION IS IF IT'S IF

03:12:04.246 --> 03:12:05.881
IT'S A NICE THING THAT WE MIGHT

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:06.815

THAT ENTERTAIN THE CONVERSATION

03:12:08.450 --> 03:12:09.885

SEEM CONSISTENT.

03:12:11.253 --> 03:12:13.788
WITH THAT THE PARTNERSHIP AROUND

03:12:13.855 --> 03:12:20.862
A PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENT LAW.

03:12:20.929 --> 03:12:21.963
THE CURRENT FINANCED HER WORDS I

03:12:22.030 --> 03:12:23.265
THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE

03:12:23.331 --> 03:12:24.566
THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE AN

03:12:24.633 --> 03:12:26.334
EFFECTIVE AND SMOOTH AND

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.003
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND

03:12:28.069 --> 03:12:29.070
THAT'S WHY WE'D BE WILLING TO

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:31.473
ENGAGE IN FURTHER CONVERSATION.

SOME QUALITATIVE DATA WILL BE

03:20:16.304 --> 03:20:17.538
GETTING FROM THERE WE ARE ALSO

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:19.941
WORKING WITH A FEW COUNTIES --

03:20:20.007 --> 03:20:22.577
THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOME TO

03:20:22.643 --> 03:20:24.412
SEE IF DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN

03:20:24.479 --> 03:20:26.280
TRACK RETURNS TO HOMELESSNESS --

03:20:26.347 --> 03:20:28.716
IT IS NOT A DATA SYSTEM THAT WE

03:20:28.783 --> 03:20:29.984
OWN OUR MOST COUNTIES --

03:20:30.051 --> 03:20:31.085
SO IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:32.086
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE

03:20:32.153 --> 03:20:33.521
COUNTY TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN

03:20:33.588 --> 03:20:35.323
GET THERE DOWN THE ROAD BUT THAT --

03:20:35.390 --> 03:20:36.257
THAT RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS

03:20:36.324 --> 03:20:37.825
NUMBERS A BIT TRICKY FOR US TO

03:20:37.892 --> 03:20:38.626
GET TO BUT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING

03:20:38.693 --> 03:20:40.862
ON IT FOR THIRTEEN COUNTY SORT

03:20:40.928 --> 03:20:41.963
OF HAVE GOOD ACCESS NOW WE'RE

03:20:42.029 --> 03:20:43.398
TRYING TO TO BUMP THAT NUMBER UP

03:20:43.464 --> 03:20:44.599
AS WE GO.

03:20:44.665 --> 03:20:45.767
AND THAT SORT OF IN TERMS OF

03:20:45.833 --> 03:20:46.934
SUCCESS --

03:20:47.001 --> 03:20:48.302
ALSO LOOKING SORT OF IT AS WE

03:20:48.369 --> 03:20:49.404
GET FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AND

03:20:49.470 --> 03:20:50.705
HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF APPROVAL

03:20:50.772 --> 03:20:52.774
RATES FOR SS I APPLICATIONS WILL

03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:54.108
BE LOOKING AT THOSE COMPARED TO

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:54.742
OTHER MODELS AND THINGS LIKE

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:56.177
THAT BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE

03:20:56.244 --> 03:20:58.045
QUITE AS MUCH EIGHT ON THAT YET

03:20:58.112 --> 03:20:58.546
BECAUSE IT.

03:20:58.613 --> 03:20:59.213
TAKES A BIT OF TIME TO GET THOSE

03:20:59.280 --> 03:21:00.715
APPROVED --

03:21:00.782 --> 03:21:01.749
AND THEN YOUR LAST QUESTION HERE

03:21:01.816 --> 03:21:03.184
ON THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE

03:21:03.251 --> 03:21:04.252
MILLION THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE

03:21:04.318 --> 03:21:05.853
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE EXPECTING

03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:06.888
THAT TO BE GIVEN A PRETTY

03:21:06.954 --> 03:21:08.556
SIMILAR WAY THAT WE ALLOCATED

03:21:08.623 --> 03:21:10.224
THE LAST ROUND THING YOU KNOW

03:21:10.291 --> 03:21:11.292
THAT THERE WILL BE A MATCH --

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:12.860
IT WILL BE COMPETITIVE WE HAVE

03:21:12.927 --> 03:21:15.563
SEEN A FEW COUNTIES THAT GOT I

03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:17.165
LOS UP FIVE LESS FUNDING IN THE

03:21:17.231 --> 03:21:18.866
FIRST ROUND SORT OF ALREADY

03:21:18.933 --> 03:21:20.101
SLOWING DOWN.

03:21:20.168 --> 03:21:21.135
THERE --

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:22.703
THEIR OUR REFERRALS AND AND

03:21:22.770 --> 03:21:24.105
APPROVAL SO THERE AND WE WE

03:21:24.172 --> 03:21:25.206
EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

03:21:25.273 --> 03:21:26.073
NAY BUT IT WILL BE GIVEN OUT A

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:29.911
PRETTY SIMILAR FASHION AS AS THE

03:21:29.977 --> 03:21:32.980
FIRST FORTY FIVE MILLION WAS.

03:21:33.047 --> 03:21:34.549
OKAY THANK YOU --

03:21:34.615 --> 03:21:43.257
COMES FROM OHIO.

03:21:43.324 --> 03:21:44.058
WE'VE REVIEWED THE GOVERNOR'S

03:21:44.125 --> 03:21:44.692
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

03:21:44.759 --> 03:21:46.093
MONEY REYES NO CONCERNS WITH THE

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:46.727
CONCEPT OF AGE THAT BEING AN

03:21:46.794 --> 03:21:48.529
ONGOING PROGRAM WE JUST --

03:21:48.596 --> 03:21:49.630
WOULD KNOW JUST SOME GENERAL

03:21:49.697 --> 03:21:51.399
IMPLEMENTATION OR TECHNICAL

03:21:51.466 --> 03:21:53.501
QUESTIONS AROUND WHEN AGED UP

03:21:53.568 --> 03:21:55.570
WAS PROPOSES A PILOT PROGRAM

03:21:55.636 --> 03:21:56.471
THEY WERE SPECIFIC --

03:21:56.537 --> 03:21:57.371
DATA --

03:21:57.438 --> 03:21:59.674
COMPONENTS THAT WERE OUTLINED

03:21:59.740 --> 03:22:00.508
BEING THAT IT'S BEEN MORE

03:22:00.575 --> 03:22:02.376
DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE SOME OF

03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:02.944
THOSE DATA COMPONENTS THAN

03:22:03.010 --> 03:22:04.245
OTHERS -- SO

03:22:04.312 --> 03:22:05.847
WITH THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE

03:22:05.913 --> 03:22:07.048
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL GETTING A

03:22:07.114 --> 03:22:08.649
BETTER SENSE OF MOVING FORWARD

03:22:08.716 --> 03:22:10.084
HOW ARE WE CAN IMPROVE THE DATA

03:22:10.151 --> 03:22:11.819
QUALITY THAT WE'RE GETTING --

03:22:11.886 --> 03:22:13.554
FROM COUNTIES TO BETTER ASSESS

03:22:13.621 --> 03:22:15.122
THE OUTCOMES WITH AN H. TOP

03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:16.157
ITSELF --

03:22:16.224 --> 03:22:17.024
BUT IN ALSO BROADER

03:22:17.091 --> 03:22:18.559
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE INITIAL

03:22:18.626 --> 03:22:20.328
FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED ABOUT

03:22:20.394 --> 03:22:21.863
THREE YEARS AGO UNDERSTANDING

03:22:21.929 --> 03:22:23.397
THAT -- IN

03:22:23.464 --> 03:22:23.998
NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BE

03:22:24.065 --> 03:22:24.966
THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH THAT

03:22:25.032 --> 03:22:25.600
FIRST --

03:22:25.666 --> 03:22:27.168
INITIAL FUNDING CAN BE SPENT

03:22:27.235 --> 03:22:28.069
DOWNS GETTING A BETTER

03:22:28.135 --> 03:22:29.604
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE TWENTY

03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:31.572
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL --

03:22:31.639 --> 03:22:32.707
LATER ON ON TOP OF THAT

03:22:32.773 --> 03:22:35.510
ADDITIONAL RESOURCE AS WELL --

03:22:35.576 --> 03:22:36.644
BUT HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING

03:22:36.711 --> 03:22:37.912
CONVERSATIONS THE DEPARTMENT

03:22:37.979 --> 03:22:39.146
SEEMS LIKE THIS IS AN EVOLVING

03:22:39.213 --> 03:22:41.215
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW HOW THE

03:22:41.282 --> 03:22:43.150
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE

03:22:43.217 --> 03:22:44.085
IMPLEMENTED.

03:22:44.151 --> 03:22:45.953
THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible]

03:22:46.020 --> 03:22:48.222
ALL RIGHT.

03:22:48.289 --> 03:22:49.223
UP SO.

03:22:49.290 --> 03:22:50.625
THE IDEA I UNDERSTAND THAT --

03:22:50.691 --> 03:22:54.629
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY.

03:22:54.695 --> 03:22:56.063
TO MEASURE THE RETURN TO

03:22:56.130 --> 03:22:56.898
HOMELESSNESS A YEAR SO YOU'RE

03:22:56.964 --> 03:22:58.666
COUNTY AND THESE AT THIRTEEN

03:22:58.733 --> 03:23:00.201
COUNTIES HAVE SOME.

03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:02.303
MECHANISM IN PLACE.

03:23:02.370 --> 03:23:04.338
TO MEASURE THAT I GUESS WHEN IT

03:23:04.405 --> 03:23:07.141
COMES -- NOW

03:23:07.208 --> 03:23:08.175
THIS THIRTEEN COUNTIES

03:23:08.242 --> 03:23:10.044
REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL OF THE

03:23:10.111 --> 03:23:12.713
STATE OR THE HOURS JUST A THIRTY

03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:14.482
BIGGEST COUNTIES PERHAPS BECAUSE

03:23:14.549 --> 03:23:16.217
THEY USUALLY HAVE MORE RESOURCES.

03:23:16.284 --> 03:23:18.252
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT

03:23:18.319 --> 03:23:19.020
LIKE WELL.

03:23:19.086 --> 03:23:19.520
WHEN IT COMES TO DOING

03:23:19.587 --> 03:23:22.557
EVALUATION --

03:23:22.623 --> 03:23:25.126
AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO

03:23:25.192 --> 03:23:27.028
I'M GOING FUNDING AT MOVING MORE

03:23:27.094 --> 03:23:27.929
TOWARD THAT AND I THINK IT'S

03:23:27.995 --> 03:23:28.863
BECAUSE THIS IS --

03:23:28.930 --> 03:23:31.198
YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM --

03:23:31.265 --> 03:23:31.599
THAT -- WE

03:23:31.666 --> 03:23:36.671
LOOKING AT SOME OTHER OF AND OR

03:23:36.737 --> 03:23:38.506
EXPANDED CAPACITIES OF COUNTIES

03:23:38.573 --> 03:23:40.942
THAT THAT DOWN MAYBE PARTNERING

03:23:41.008 --> 03:23:42.577
OF COUNTIES THAT DO SO THEY CAN

03:23:42.643 --> 03:23:45.079
NOW LEVERAGE OFF EACH OTHER IN

03:23:45.146 --> 03:23:46.647
TERMS OF EXISTING SYSTEM SO.

03:23:46.714 --> 03:23:48.516
HE SPEAK TO WHAT MIGHT BE FUTURE

03:23:48.583 --> 03:23:50.151
PLANS FOR FEMALE TO BE SURE WE

03:23:50.217 --> 03:23:52.286
CAN GET THE KIND OF INFORMATION

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:54.221
WE NEED TO SHOW THAT WERE --

03:23:54.288 --> 03:23:55.156
THAT WILL GAIN CAM RESULTS WERE

03:23:55.222 --> 03:23:57.158
EXPECTING YEAH SO I I THINK A

03:23:57.224 --> 03:23:59.293
LITTLE BIT OF THIS IS THERE'S

03:23:59.360 --> 03:23:59.894
ALSO DISCUSIONS HAPPENING AT

03:23:59.961 --> 03:24:01.729
THE STATE LEVEL AROUND SORT OF A

03:24:01.796 --> 03:24:02.964
STATEWIDE DATA WAREHOUSE FOR

03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:04.031
HOMELESSNESS WHICH IF THAT WERE

03:24:04.098 --> 03:24:06.067
TO COME. TO PLAY WE'D BE ABLE TO

03:24:06.133 --> 03:24:08.035
SORT OF MATCH TO THAT DATA SET

03:24:08.102 --> 03:24:09.070
AND BE ABLE TO SEE THAT

03:24:09.136 --> 03:24:10.771
SOMETHING IS STATEWIDE LEVEL --

03:24:10.838 --> 03:24:12.340
I EXPECT THAT TO BE QUITE A FEW

03:24:12.406 --> 03:24:13.274
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THOUGH SO I

03:24:13.341 --> 03:24:14.675
I MEAN I THINK FOR THE THIRTEEN

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:16.744
COUNTIES THAT ARE ARE CURRENTLY.

03:24:16.811 --> 03:24:19.347
I WOULD SAY ACTIVELY ABLE TO GET

03:24:19.413 --> 03:24:20.615
DATA OUT OF THE H. I. S. SYSTEM

03:24:20.681 --> 03:24:22.717
IT'S IT'S A VERY GROUP --

03:24:22.783 --> 03:24:24.652
OUR HOPE IS THOUGH THAT JUST

03:24:24.719 --> 03:24:26.120
FROM A A SYSTEMS OUR

03:24:26.187 --> 03:24:27.655
COLLABORATION STANDPOINT THAT WE

03:24:27.722 --> 03:24:28.923
CAN BRING MORE COUNTIES INTO

03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:30.424
THAT SPACE --

03:24:30.491 --> 03:24:31.892
AND IT WOULD IT WOULD TAKE MORE

03:24:31.959 --> 03:24:33.194
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE OTHER

03:24:33.260 --> 03:24:34.395
BUT WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN OR

03:24:34.462 --> 03:24:35.029
OTHER --

03:24:35.096 --> 03:24:36.163
PROGRAM BRINGING FAMILIES HOME

03:24:36.230 --> 03:24:37.698
HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WITH AN

03:24:37.765 --> 03:24:39.667
EXTERNAL EVALUATOR SORT OF ON

03:24:39.734 --> 03:24:40.601
THE GROUND HELPING THEM FIGURE

03:24:40.668 --> 03:24:40.935
OUT.

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:43.070
THAT THE DATA PRIVACY PIECES OF

03:24:43.137 --> 03:24:44.438
OF SOME OF THAT SO THE HOPE

03:24:44.505 --> 03:24:46.540
WOULD BE THAT --

03:24:46.607 --> 03:24:47.274
WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND AND

03:24:47.341 --> 03:24:48.376
SOME OF AND AND WITH THE ONGOING

03:24:48.442 --> 03:24:49.577
NATURE THAT THERE'S MORE

03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:50.878
INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY

03:24:50.945 --> 03:24:56.384
PARTICIPATE LONG TERM IT IN THAT --

03:24:56.450 --> 03:25:00.121
MODEL IN THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:25:00.187 --> 03:25:00.655
TWENTY FOUR MONTH SAYS IT

03:25:00.721 --> 03:25:02.857
DOESN'T STATUTES.

03:25:02.923 --> 03:25:03.524
OKAY THE OBVIOUS THING I AT

03:25:03.591 --> 03:25:04.692
LEAST IN THE BEGINNING IF

03:25:04.759 --> 03:25:06.560
THERE'S A WAY.

03:25:06.627 --> 03:25:07.962
TO MAYBE A SAMPLE RIGHT.

03:25:08.029 --> 03:25:09.063
OF COURSE THIS IS AT THE

03:25:09.130 --> 03:25:09.497
THIRTEEN MAY NOT BE

03:25:09.563 --> 03:25:11.399
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERSTATE

03:25:11.465 --> 03:25:13.300
BUT THE AND AND THINKING ABOUT

03:25:13.367 --> 03:25:14.802
LIKE WILDER PARTICULAR COUNTY SO

03:25:14.869 --> 03:25:16.237
MIGHT BE MORE WILLING THAT THEY

03:25:16.303 --> 03:25:18.072
HAD SOME ASSISTANCE FROM MY

03:25:18.139 --> 03:25:18.939
COUNTY THAT THREE DOING YET THEY

03:25:19.006 --> 03:25:20.574
CAN LEVERAGE OFF THEIR SYSTEM OR

03:25:20.641 --> 03:25:21.175
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

03:25:21.242 --> 03:25:23.277
ARE THAT WRITING THEM ASSISTANCE

03:25:23.344 --> 03:25:24.845
IN THAT REGARD SO FORTUNATELY

03:25:24.912 --> 03:25:26.747
ALL OF THE HMS SYSTEMS ARE OWNED

03:25:26.814 --> 03:25:27.915
BY --

03:25:27.982 --> 03:25:29.150
SEPARATE ENTITIES ACROSS AND

03:25:29.216 --> 03:25:30.217
THEY SORT OF HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

03:25:30.284 --> 03:25:31.585
DATA PRIVACY RULES AND SO WE'VE

03:25:31.652 --> 03:25:32.620
DONE A LITTLE BIT OF PEER

03:25:32.687 --> 03:25:34.455
SHARING OF AT LEAST THIS IS HOW

03:25:34.522 --> 03:25:35.723
WE WERE ABLE TO GET.

03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:37.958
ACCESS TO IN OUR COUNTY AND YOU

03:25:38.025 --> 03:25:38.826
CAN GO AND TALK TO YOUR A TO MY

03:25:38.893 --> 03:25:39.994
AS CORNY OR IN YOUR COUNTY SOME

03:25:40.061 --> 03:25:40.995
OF THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING I

03:25:41.062 --> 03:25:42.363
WOULD SAY THAT WITH THE THIRTEEN

03:25:42.430 --> 03:25:43.698
THAT WE HAVE WOULD BE ABLE.

03:25:43.764 --> 03:25:44.999
TO SAY SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD

03:25:45.066 --> 03:25:46.634
JUST SORT OF NOTING THOUGH THAT

03:25:46.701 --> 03:25:49.603
EVEN IF THEY GET THEIR A SOCIETY

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:50.271
YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN

03:25:50.337 --> 03:25:51.772
IMPLEMENTED FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW

03:25:51.839 --> 03:25:53.607
THEY GET THEIR **** SIDE WE

03:25:53.674 --> 03:25:54.442
DON'T NECESSARILY ACCEPT THEM

03:25:54.508 --> 03:25:55.109
RIGHT OFF.

03:25:55.176 --> 03:25:55.710
AND THEN IT WOULD TAKE A SIX

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:57.712
MONTH AT MINIMUM FROM THERE SO

OF THE ASTOUNDING JOBS

03:27:39.013 --> 03:27:39.713

HERE TODAY THOUGH ACTUALLY TO

03:27:46.787 --> 03:27:48.689
PRESENT ON AND A SEPARATE ISSUE

03:27:48.756 --> 03:27:51.192
BUT RELATED WHICH IS THE THAT'S

03:27:51.258 --> 03:27:53.661
THE ESSENCE I GRANT LEVELS --

03:27:53.727 --> 03:27:56.564
AND I WAS LISTENING EARLIER IN

03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:57.798
THE DAY OUT --

03:27:57.865 --> 03:27:59.233
SENATOR STONE --

03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:01.068
HAD MADE A COMMENT ABOUT SORT OF

03:28:01.135 --> 03:28:08.442
THE STATE OF BE YOU KNOW OF EVEN

03:28:08.509 --> 03:28:08.742
[inaudible]

03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:14.548
SOME SECURITY CHECK CAN'T LIVE --

03:28:14.615 --> 03:28:16.150
OUT OF OUTSIDE OF POVERTY

03:28:16.217 --> 03:28:17.751
ANYMORE IN OUR STATE THAT COSTS

03:28:17.818 --> 03:28:20.721
OF RIBBONS RISEN SO QUICKLY --

03:28:20.788 --> 03:28:21.889
THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO

03:28:21.956 --> 03:28:23.424
THAT WELL WE HAVE --

03:28:23.490 --> 03:28:25.793
ROUGHLY WE HAVE THE LARGEST

03:28:25.860 --> 03:28:28.062
NUMBER OF OVER SIXTY FIVE SS I

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.496
RECIPIENTS OF ANY STATE IN THE

03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:31.699
COUNTRY SO AS CENTER STONE WAS

03:28:31.765 --> 03:28:33.367
TALKING ABOUT THIS JUST STRUCK

03:28:33.434 --> 03:28:34.401
ME THAT.

03:28:34.468 --> 03:28:35.502
EVERYTHING HE'S DESCRIBING

03:28:35.569 --> 03:28:37.271
APPLIES TO THAT AS THE SITE

03:28:37.338 --> 03:28:39.540
POPULATION BUT EVEN MORE BECAUSE

03:28:39.607 --> 03:28:41.742
THEIR MAXIMUM GRANT IS NINE

03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:42.710
HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A

03:28:42.776 --> 03:28:43.277
MONTH.

03:28:43.344 --> 03:28:45.346
SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON SOCIAL

03:28:45.412 --> 03:28:47.514
SECURITY ARE GETTING OLD

03:28:47.581 --> 03:28:48.883
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT ABOVE THAT

03:28:48.949 --> 03:28:50.718
I'M STILL NOT ADEQUATE I

03:28:50.784 --> 03:28:52.186
COMPLETELY GROUP CENTER STONE ON

03:28:52.253 --> 03:28:53.354
THAT POINT --

03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:55.222
BUT I I THINK IT AGAIN BEARS

03:28:55.289 --> 03:28:57.258
REPEATING THAT WE STILL HAVE

03:28:57.324 --> 03:28:59.627
CUTS IN PLACE THAT WE TOOK --

03:28:59.693 --> 03:29:00.961
DURING THE TIME OF GOVERNOR

03:29:01.028 --> 03:29:02.863
SCHWARZENEGGER --

03:29:02.930 --> 03:29:04.298
THAT REDUCE THE STATE'S

03:29:04.365 --> 03:29:06.233
CONTRIBUTION TO THE GRANT TO THE

03:29:06.300 --> 03:29:08.369
POINT WERE WERE ONLY I THINK

03:29:08.435 --> 03:29:09.904
FOUR DOLLARS ABOVE THE ABSOLUTE.

03:29:09.970 --> 03:29:11.872
BOTTOM THAT WE CAN PROVIDE UNDER

03:29:11.939 --> 03:29:13.140
FEDERAL LAW HUNDRED SIXTY

03:29:13.207 --> 03:29:16.310
DOLLARS A MONTH THE MINIMUM IS --

03:29:16.377 --> 03:29:19.413
ONE FIFTY SIX AND SO AGAIN AS

03:29:19.480 --> 03:29:20.514
EACH YEAR THAT WE GO ALONG WE

03:29:20.581 --> 03:29:21.048
SEE THAT.

03:29:21.115 --> 03:29:22.316
THE POVERTY LEVEL FOR THAT

03:29:22.383 --> 03:29:25.819
CREATES --

03:29:25.886 --> 03:29:26.453
AGAIN WE DROPPED OVER A MILLION

03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:29.790
PEOPLE TIME THAT WAS OUR ACTS

03:29:29.857 --> 03:29:31.859
THAT WE DID HERE AND THAT NUMBER

03:29:31.926 --> 03:29:32.760
KEEPS GOING DOWN I THINK WE'RE

03:29:32.826 --> 03:29:35.329
DOWN TO ABOUT 90% OF THE FEDERAL

03:29:35.396 --> 03:29:36.697
POVERTY LEVEL NOW --

03:29:36.764 --> 03:29:38.732
NOW IT WAS GREAT THAT WE ARE

03:29:38.799 --> 03:29:40.601
DOING THE CALPERS EXPANSION AND

03:29:40.668 --> 03:29:42.703
THAT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT OF

03:29:42.770 --> 03:29:42.937
FOLKS.

03:29:43.003 --> 03:29:43.938
BUT WHEN YOU DO THE MATH AND

03:29:44.004 --> 03:29:46.307
EVEN IF WERE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL

03:29:46.373 --> 03:29:48.242
LET'S SAY WE GOT A HALF OF HALF

03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:50.044
A MILLION AS A SLIGHT RECIPIENTS

03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:51.378
IN ROLLED AND CAL FOR US.

03:29:51.445 --> 03:29:54.848
THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE SEVEN

03:29:54.915 --> 03:29:55.449
HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES WHO DO

03:29:55.516 --> 03:29:57.184
NOT BENEFIT FROM THE CALPERS

03:29:57.251 --> 03:29:59.119
EXPANSION MEANING THAT THEY

03:29:59.186 --> 03:30:03.090
AREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING ANY

03:30:03.157 --> 03:30:03.757
INCREASE IN THEIR BENEFIT AT ALL.

03:30:03.824 --> 03:30:04.258
IT'S A WIN FOR THE TNTH

03:30:04.325 --> 03:30:06.026
CONSECUTIVE YEAR WE'RE GOING TO

03:30:06.093 --> 03:30:07.962
BE TAKING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

03:30:08.028 --> 03:30:09.430
A YEAR ANNUALLY FROM THAT

03:30:09.496 --> 03:30:10.764
POPULATION.

03:30:10.831 --> 03:30:12.366
NOT PROVIDING IT TO THEM AND I'M

03:30:12.433 --> 03:30:14.068
WOULD SUGGEST THAT OVER TIME

03:30:14.134 --> 03:30:17.204
THIS IS HAVING TO MAKE-SIGNIFICANT DETRIMENTAL EFFECT.

03:30:17.271 --> 03:30:18.872
ON THE THE PEOPLE ON THE US

03:30:18.939 --> 03:30:21.275
ASIDE IN THE US AYE CASELOAD --

03:30:21.342 --> 03:30:22.376
I THINK WE'RE SEEM HIGHER LEVELS

03:30:22.443 --> 03:30:24.478
OF HOMELESSNESS --

03:30:24.545 --> 03:30:25.813
HIGHER LEVELS OF ILLNESS.

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:27.348
PEOPLE ARE REALLY REALLY

03:30:27.414 --> 03:30:29.083
STRUGGLING TO GET BY AND SO WE

03:30:29.149 --> 03:30:31.318
ARE BACK AGAIN ASKING.

03:30:31.385 --> 03:30:33.287
FOR AUGMENTATIONS TO THE BUDGET

03:30:33.354 --> 03:30:34.822
THAT WOULD MAKE.

03:30:34.888 --> 03:30:36.223
SURE THAT THE GRANT LEVELS FOR

03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:38.525
SSI RECIPIENTS HITS THE 1100%

03:30:38.592 --> 03:30:40.127
LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

03:30:40.194 --> 03:30:41.395
LEVEL NOW WE DON'T THINK THAT'S

03:30:41.462 --> 03:30:43.030
A PANACEA WE DON'T THINK THAT

03:30:43.097 --> 03:30:44.932
THAT'S PROBABLY EVEN COMPLETELY

03:30:44.999 --> 03:30:45.632
ADEQUATE.

03:30:45.699 --> 03:30:48.769
BUT WE THINK IS A STARTING POINT

03:30:48.836 --> 03:30:50.037
FOR THE LEDGE --

03:30:50.104 --> 03:30:53.507
INTO WE'VE COME FORTH AND

03:30:53.574 --> 03:30:55.142
SUGGESTED THAT WE DO THIS OVER.

03:30:55.209 --> 03:30:58.312
A COUPLE BUDGETS I THINK WE

03:30:58.379 --> 03:30:59.179
WOULD STILL BE OPEN TO APPROACH

03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:00.547
LIKE THAT AND WE'RE HOPING THAT

03:31:00.614 --> 03:31:02.182
THE TIME WILL COME THIS YEAR

03:31:02.249 --> 03:31:03.417
WHERE WE CAN PUT THAT PLAN IN

03:31:03.484 --> 03:31:05.052
EFFECT AND GET IT DONE.

03:31:05.119 --> 03:31:06.387

04:30:54.538 --> 04:30:56.239
THAT WILL BE OCCURRING AND IS

04:30:56.306 --> 04:30:57.708
ALREADY OCCURRING IN ELECTRONIC

04:30:57.774 --> 04:30:59.443
TIME SHEETS AND THEN WE'LL

04:30:59.509 --> 04:31:00.844
CONTINUE WITH EBV.

04:31:00.911 --> 04:31:03.680
ON THE IS THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF

04:31:03.747 --> 04:31:05.382
WILL PROMPT PEOPLE AS THEY

04:31:11.955 --> 04:31:14.091
SO IF PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING NOW TO

04:31:14.157 --> 04:31:15.392
USE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS THEY

04:31:15.459 --> 04:31:17.461

04:31:17.527 --> 04:31:18.996
THE THINGS WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO

EXPECTING THIS TO CONTINUE TO

04:32:04.307 --> 04:32:06.343
INCREASE ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK

04:32:06.410 --> 04:32:07.678
PART OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS

04:32:07.744 --> 04:32:09.513

04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:35.992
SPECIFICS ABOUT I JUST US AND

04:34:36.059 --> 04:34:38.195
COUNTY FUNDING SO.

04:34:38.261 --> 04:34:40.864
LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH LA JOH.

04:34:40.931 --> 04:34:42.399
SO ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF THE

04:34:42.465 --> 04:34:44.201
AGENDA YOU'LL FIND A FLOW CHART

04:34:44.267 --> 04:34:47.337
THAT JUSTICE BLAZE HOW NINETEEN

04:34:47.404 --> 04:34:47.871
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IS

04:34:47.938 --> 04:34:48.939
STRUCTURED.

04:34:49.005 --> 04:34:50.907
AND WE WERE ASKED TO BROACH JUST

04:34:50.974 --> 04:34:52.042
WALK THROUGH THIS.

04:34:52.108 --> 04:34:54.477
SO IN GENERAL REALIGNMENT WHAT

04:34:54.544 --> 04:34:55.712
DOES THAT MEAN IT PROVIDES

04:34:55.779 --> 04:34:58.782
COUNTIES WITH DEDICATED REVENUES

04:34:58.849 --> 04:35:00.150
TO PAY FOR PROGRAM COSTS.

04:35:00.217 --> 04:35:01.852
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE

04:35:01.918 --> 04:35:03.019
SPECIFICALLY.

04:35:03.086 --> 04:35:03.820
A NUMBER OF COSTA

04:35:03.887 --> 04:35:06.256
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SOCIAL

04:35:06.323 --> 04:35:07.824
SERVICES HEALTH AND MENTAL

04:35:07.891 --> 04:35:09.559
HEALTH PROGRAMS WERE LARGELY

04:35:09.626 --> 04:35:11.328
TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE TO

04:35:11.394 --> 04:35:12.796
THE COUNTIES.

04:35:12.863 --> 04:35:14.397
SO WHEN YOU SEE IN THE CHART

04:35:14.464 --> 04:35:15.899
IT'S BESET THE REVENUES THAT

04:35:15.966 --> 04:35:17.868
THAN WERE PROVIDED TO COUNTIES

04:35:17.934 --> 04:35:19.402
TO PAY FOR THESE NEW COST.

04:35:19.469 --> 04:35:21.838
WAS BOTH A PORTION OF THE

04:35:21.905 --> 04:35:23.773
VEHICLE LICENSE FEE AND A

04:35:23.840 --> 04:35:27.611
PORTION OF SALES TAX AND

04:35:27.677 --> 04:35:28.345
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DOES TO GIVE

04:35:28.411 --> 04:35:30.947
YOU A SENSE OF MAGNITUDE LF

04:35:31.014 --> 04:35:33.250
REVENUE THAT FLOWED TO NINETEEN

04:35:33.316 --> 04:35:33.783
EIGHTY ONE REALIGNMENT WAS

04:35:33.850 --> 04:35:36.453
AROUND. TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND

04:35:36.519 --> 04:35:38.088
THE AMOUNT OF SALES TAX THAT

04:35:38.154 --> 04:35:40.123
FLOWED TO REALIGNMENT WAS AROUND

04:35:40.190 --> 04:35:42.425
THREE BILLION.

04:35:42.492 --> 04:35:44.361
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART

04:35:44.427 --> 04:35:45.495
REALIGNMENT IS MADE UP OF A

04:35:45.562 --> 04:35:47.163
NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS AND THEY'RE

04:35:47.230 --> 04:35:48.632
GENERALLY DEFINED BY PROGRAM

04:35:48.698 --> 04:35:50.634
AREA SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH

04:35:50.700 --> 04:35:51.968
MENTAL HEALTH.

04:35:52.035 --> 04:35:53.937
NOW HOW THE REVENUES FLOW WITHIN

04:35:54.004 --> 04:35:56.406
THE STRUCTURE THEY FOLLOW RANK

04:35:56.473 --> 04:35:57.674
ORDER.

04:35:57.741 --> 04:36:00.043
THE SOCIAL SERVICES ACCOUNT GETS

04:36:00.110 --> 04:36:01.544
THE FIRST CALL ON THE DOLLAR.

04:36:01.611 --> 04:36:05.115
AND THIS SUB ACCOUNT INCLUDES

04:36:05.181 --> 04:36:06.850
COUNTY COST FOR I'D JUST US.

04:36:06.917 --> 04:36:09.352
THEN THE REVENUES WOULD FLOW --

04:36:09.419 --> 04:36:10.787
TO COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES

04:36:10.854 --> 04:36:12.756
PROGRAMS WHICH IS A SMALL NUMBER

04:36:12.822 --> 04:36:13.823
OF COUNTIES FOR THEIR HEALTH

04:36:13.890 --> 04:36:14.991
PROGRAMS.

04:36:15.058 --> 04:36:16.526
AND THEN LASTLY TO THE GENERAL

04:36:16.593 --> 04:36:18.061
HEALTH ACCOUNT AND MENTAL HEALTH

04:36:18.128 --> 04:36:19.663
ACCOUNTS AND YOU SEE YOU EVEN

04:36:19.729 --> 04:36:20.664
WITHIN THE HEALTH AND MENTAL

04:36:20.730 --> 04:36:22.165
HEALTH ACCOUNTS THEY HAVE SUB

04:36:22.232 --> 04:36:23.366
ACCOUNTS WITHIN THEM.

04:36:23.433 --> 04:36:24.434
IN WHICH A PORTION OF THEIR

04:36:24.501 --> 04:36:26.036
REVENUES THAT THEY GET GO TO

04:36:26.102 --> 04:36:27.671
THESE ACCOUNTS TO ULTIMATELY

04:36:27.737 --> 04:36:31.041
THAN OFFSET STATE CAL WORKS COST.

04:36:31.107 --> 04:36:32.208
NOW THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT

04:36:32.275 --> 04:36:34.377
GOES INTO EACH ACCOUNT IN ANY

04:36:34.444 --> 04:36:35.645
GIVEN YEAR --

04:36:35.712 --> 04:36:37.747
DEPENDS ON TWO FACTORS THE FIRST

04:36:37.814 --> 04:36:39.582
BEING THAT EVERY ACCOUNT GETS

04:36:39.649 --> 04:36:41.151
THE AMOUNT THAT THEY RECEIVED

04:36:41.217 --> 04:36:43.286
FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND THAT'S

04:36:43.353 --> 04:36:44.821
REFERRED TO AS BASE FUNDING.

04:36:44.888 --> 04:36:46.690
SO ONCE EACH ACCOUNT IN THE

04:36:46.756 --> 04:36:48.191
ORDER THAT I JUST DESCRIBED GETS

04:36:48.258 --> 04:36:49.759
THERE'S THEIR BASE FUNDING TO

04:36:49.826 --> 04:36:51.061
THE EXTENT THAT THERE ANY DâN

04:36:51.127 --> 04:36:53.396
REALIGNMENT REVENUES LEFTOVER.

04:36:53.463 --> 04:36:54.597
THAT'S AGAIN RE DISTRIBUTED

04:36:54.664 --> 04:36:55.966
TEACH ACOUNT IN THE ORDER AND

04:36:56.032 --> 04:36:59.069
THOSE ARE CALLED GROWTH FUNDS.

04:36:59.135 --> 04:37:01.671
ON THE WAY BACK VLF GROWTH FUNDS

04:37:01.738 --> 04:37:02.939
ARE DISTRIBUTED --

04:37:03.006 --> 04:37:04.808
YOU'LL SEE THAT DAY FIRST GO TO

04:37:04.874 --> 04:37:08.311
SEE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH.

04:37:08.378 --> 04:37:10.213
IT'S REALLY THE CONVERSATION

04:37:10.280 --> 04:37:12.382
AROUND HOUSE SALES TAX GROWTH

04:37:12.449 --> 04:37:13.717
DOLLARS ARE --

04:37:13.783 --> 04:37:15.151
HOW DO THEY FLOW THROUGH THE

04:37:15.218 --> 04:37:16.853
SYSTEM WHERE WE GET INTO THE

04:37:16.920 --> 04:37:18.421
SITE JUST AS CONVERSATION

04:37:18.488 --> 04:37:19.889
BECAUSE THE SALES TAX GROWTH

04:37:19.956 --> 04:37:21.758
FUNDS FIRST GO TO THE SOCIAL

04:37:21.825 --> 04:37:23.059
SERVICES SUB ACCOUNT?

04:37:23.126 --> 04:37:24.961
AND THE COSTS THAT THOSE GROWTH

04:37:25.028 --> 04:37:26.496
DOLLARS ARE USED TO COVER

04:37:26.563 --> 04:37:28.698
REFLECT YEAR TO YEAR GROWTH IN

04:37:28.765 --> 04:37:30.133
THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE SOCIAL

04:37:30.200 --> 04:37:31.534
SERVICES ACCOUNT.

04:37:31.601 --> 04:37:32.869
AND THOSE --

04:37:32.936 --> 04:37:35.205
GROWTH IS ATTRIBUTED IN MOST

04:37:35.271 --> 04:37:38.408
CASES TO JUST GROWTH IN CASELOAD.

04:37:38.475 --> 04:37:39.175
NOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

04:37:39.242 --> 04:37:41.845
AREN'T ENOUGH GROWTH DOLLARS TO

04:37:41.911 --> 04:37:43.580
COVER THOSE COST --

04:37:43.646 --> 04:37:44.681
THEN THAT MEANS IN THAT

04:37:44.748 --> 04:37:46.549
PARTICULAR YEAR SALES TAX GROWTH

04:37:46.616 --> 04:37:47.984
DOLLARS DON'T FLOW TO HEALTH AND

04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:49.152
MENTAL HEALTH.

04:37:49.219 --> 04:37:50.487
AND THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR AND

04:37:50.553 --> 04:37:51.988
MULTIPLE YEARS BECAUSE THE WAY

04:37:52.055 --> 04:37:54.157
THAT REALIGNMENT WORKS IS IF

04:37:54.224 --> 04:37:55.425
THERE ANY IF THERE'S ANY ON MAC

04:37:55.492 --> 04:37:57.260
COST WITHIN THE SOCIAL SERVICES

04:37:57.327 --> 04:37:58.762
UP ACCOUNT FACTS TRACKED.

04:37:58.828 --> 04:38:00.964
UNTIL IT'S PAID IN FULL WITH

04:38:01.031 --> 04:38:03.299
FUTURE REVENUE SOURCES --

04:38:03.366 --> 04:38:04.701
SO COULD BE A NUMBER OF YEARS

04:38:04.768 --> 04:38:05.668
UNTIL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

04:38:05.735 --> 04:38:07.871
I'M SEIZE ANY FORM OF SALES TAX

04:38:07.937 --> 04:38:09.606
GROWTH AND THAT'S THE SITUATION --

04:38:09.672 --> 04:38:10.974
WE GOT OURSELVES IN IN THE

04:38:11.041 --> 04:38:12.876
RECENT YEARS WITH THE CHANGES

04:38:12.942 --> 04:38:14.010
THAT WERE MADE TO I JUST AS

04:38:14.077 --> 04:38:16.379
COUNTY COST WERE UNDER CURRENT

04:38:16.446 --> 04:38:17.213
LAW.

04:38:17.280 --> 04:38:18.314
COUNTY COSTA --

04:38:18.381 --> 04:38:22.585
WERE SO LARGE THAT REALIZE COVER

04:38:22.652 --> 04:38:23.987
THEM SO WHAT THAT MEANT FOR HELP

04:38:24.054 --> 04:38:25.388
HEALTH AND MENTAL IN THE CASE O

04:38:25.455 --> 04:38:27.090
SALES TAXES THAT NO DOLLARS ARE

04:38:27.157 --> 04:38:28.658
FLOWING TO THEIR TO THOSE

04:38:28.725 --> 04:38:30.160
ACCOUNTS BUT ALSO.

04:38:30.226 --> 04:38:31.461
BE A LEFT GROWTH FUNDS WERE

04:38:31.528 --> 04:38:32.796
TEMPORALLY RE DIRECTED FROM

04:38:32.862 --> 04:38:34.697
HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH TO PAY

04:38:34.764 --> 04:38:35.532
OFF -- I

04:38:35.598 --> 04:38:37.534
JUST AS COST AND I'LL LET

04:38:37.600 --> 04:38:38.601
FINANCE EXPLAIN SOME OF THEIR

04:38:38.668 --> 04:38:40.303
CHANGES THAT UNDO SOME OF THESE

04:38:40.370 --> 04:38:43.006
THINGS AND ALLOW ADDITIONAL

04:38:43.073 --> 04:38:45.175
FUNDS ARE MORE FUNDS --

04:38:45.241 --> 04:38:46.176
TO FLORIDA HEALTH AND MENTAL

04:38:46.242 --> 04:38:47.277
HEALTH AND THEN I'LL SHARE OUR

04:38:47.343 --> 04:38:48.711
COMMENTS ON THOSE

04:38:48.778 --> 04:38:49.979
RECOMMENDATIONS.

04:38:50.046 --> 04:38:51.714
I THANK YOU FINANCE.

04:39:04.861 --> 04:39:05.829
REALIGNMENT REPORT.

04:39:05.895 --> 04:39:07.163
THE PRIMARY FINDING BASS OUR

04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:08.465
ANALYSIS IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF

04:39:08.531 --> 04:39:10.834
REVENUE AVAILABLE UNDER NINETEEN

04:39:10.900 --> 04:39:11.434
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT CANNOT

04:39:11.501 --> 04:39:12.902
SUPPORT THE COST OF THE CURRENT

04:39:12.969 --> 04:39:15.472
PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH REALIGNMENT.

04:39:15.538 --> 04:39:16.940
THIS IS NOT DUE TO CONSTRUCT

04:39:17.006 --> 04:39:18.741
CONSTRUCT OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN

04:39:18.808 --> 04:39:20.410
BUT IT'S MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

04:39:20.477 --> 04:39:21.444
CHANGES.

04:39:21.511 --> 04:39:22.779
THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO

04:39:22.846 --> 04:39:24.914
THE REALIGN PROGRAMS PRIMARILY I

04:39:24.981 --> 04:39:26.316
HSS.

04:39:26.382 --> 04:39:27.550
AND SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE

04:39:27.617 --> 04:39:29.752
THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES

04:39:29.819 --> 04:39:31.955
AND PAID OVERTIME.

04:39:32.021 --> 04:39:33.490
THERE'S ALSO THE IMPLEMENTATION

04:39:33.556 --> 04:39:34.791
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH

04:39:34.858 --> 04:39:36.159
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE

04:39:36.226 --> 04:39:38.128
INDIGENT HEALTH POPULATION AND

04:39:38.194 --> 04:39:39.496
THE REDIRECTION OF FUNDS TO

SUPPORT CAO WORKS GRANT

04:39:40.964 --> 04:39:42.532
INCREASES.

04:39:42.599 --> 04:39:44.100
BASED ON THIS REPORTS FINANCE

04:39:44.167 --> 04:39:45.401
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A

04:39:45.468 --> 04:39:47.370
NUMBER CHANGES TO NINETEEN

NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT THAT WILL

04:39:48.738 --> 04:39:50.340
ACCOMPLISH THREE MAIN GOALS. FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE REST

04:39:52.041 --> 04:39:53.476
ACCOUNTING IS OF HAVING TO USE

04:39:53.543 --> 04:39:55.578
GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS TO COVER

04:39:55.645 --> 04:39:56.713
AYE HSS COSTS.

04:39:56.779 --> 04:39:58.982

HAD ALLUDED.

04:40:03.920 --> 04:40:05.054
TO AND THIRD IMPROVE

CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH NINETY

04:40:16.065 --> 04:40:18.134
BUDGET SPECIFICALLY PROPOSES TO

04:40:26.142 --> 04:40:28.011
A REDUCTION OF FOUR HUNDRED

FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION.

04:40:29.546 --> 04:40:31.014
THE REVISED IMHO YOU PROJECT

04:40:31.080 --> 04:40:32.348
REFLECTS THE PROJECTED LEVEL

04:40:32.415 --> 04:40:34.317
COUNTIES I HSS COSTS THAT CAN BE

04:40:34.384 --> 04:40:37.220
FUNDED WITH IN NINETEEN NINETY

ONE REALIGNMENT IN THE BUDGET

04:40:37.887 --> 04:40:38.388
YEAR.

04:40:38.454 --> 04:40:40.390
SECONDLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO

04:40:40.456 --> 04:40:42.091
REDUCE THE ANNUAL MOE INFLATION

04:40:42.158 --> 04:40:46.563

AND TWENTY THREE WE KNOW THAT

04:41:47.757 --> 04:41:49.392
THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT ELIMINATE

04:41:49.459 --> 04:41:50.927
THE REST TO COUNTIES FROM THE

POTENTIAL REVENUE.

04:41:51.761 --> 04:41:53.596

JANUARY WE DID --

04:42:35.471 --> 04:42:37.307
OUR OWN ASSESSMENT OF NINETEEN

04:42:37.373 --> 04:42:38.474
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT BACK IN

04:42:38.541 --> 04:42:40.009
OCTOBER WHERE WE ARE GENERAL I

04:42:40.076 --> 04:42:42.512
IDENTIFIED GENERAL PRINCIPLES.

04:42:42.578 --> 04:42:44.314
IN WHICH YOU COULD USE TO

04:42:44.380 --> 04:42:47.317
EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OR A

04:42:47.383 --> 04:42:48.017
VALUE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

04:42:48.084 --> 04:42:48.951
REALIGNMENT.

04:42:49.018 --> 04:42:50.386
AND WE FOUND SOMEWHERE TO WHAT

04:42:50.453 --> 04:42:52.789
FINANCE FOUND IN THEIR REPORT IS --

04:42:52.855 --> 04:42:54.324
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THERE WAS

04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:56.092
A MISALIGNMENT WITH THOSE

04:42:56.159 --> 04:42:57.393
PRINCIPLES --

04:42:57.460 --> 04:42:59.562
FINANCES RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED

04:42:59.629 --> 04:43:00.663
CHANGES TO I JUST SAYS

04:43:00.730 --> 04:43:02.165
DEFINITELY MOVES IN THE RIGHT

04:43:02.231 --> 04:43:04.634
DIRECTION OF MEETING THE CORE

04:43:04.701 --> 04:43:05.968
PRINCIPLES THAT WE IDENTIFIED

04:43:06.035 --> 04:43:08.905
SPECIFICALLY THAT COST WITHIN --

04:43:08.971 --> 04:43:10.640
BACK COUNTY COST REFLECT THEIR

04:43:10.707 --> 04:43:12.375
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY CONTROL THE

04:43:12.442 --> 04:43:13.776
PROGRAM.

04:43:13.843 --> 04:43:15.478
FIVE REDUCING THE COUNTY ACOSTA

04:43:15.545 --> 04:43:17.180
NITROUS AS WE THINK THAT THE TO

04:43:17.246 --> 04:43:18.581
MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

04:43:18.648 --> 04:43:19.682
BUT THEN ALSO THAT REVENUES

04:43:19.749 --> 04:43:21.651
WITHIN REALIGNMENT COVER COST

04:43:21.718 --> 04:43:23.820
OVER TIME IN THESE CHANGES

04:43:23.886 --> 04:43:25.321
IMPROVE THAT PROBABILITY --

04:43:25.388 --> 04:43:26.656
WE ALSO REYES --

04:43:26.723 --> 04:43:27.857
SOME GENERAL BIG PICTURE

04:43:27.924 --> 04:43:29.125
QUESTIONS --

04:43:29.192 --> 04:43:30.660
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

04:43:30.727 --> 04:43:32.161
ONE BEING THAT WHETHER

04:43:32.228 --> 04:43:33.563
REALIGNMENT REVENUES WILL BE

04:43:33.629 --> 04:43:34.831
SUFFICIENT TO COVER COUNTIES

04:43:34.897 --> 04:43:36.866
COST IN THE LONG TERM REMAINS

04:43:36.933 --> 04:43:39.435
UNCLEAR THAT'S JUST DUMB.

04:43:39.502 --> 04:43:41.838
HOW REALIGNMENT WORKS SO

04:43:41.904 --> 04:43:44.941
SOMETHING THE ANNUAL BUDGET

04:43:45.007 --> 04:43:47.977
PROCESS REALIGNMENT REVENUES AND

04:43:48.044 --> 04:43:49.345
IN ANY GIVEN YEAR --

04:43:49.412 --> 04:43:50.613
ARE THEY GENERALLY COVERING

04:43:50.680 --> 04:43:51.748
COUNTY COST.

04:43:51.814 --> 04:43:52.648
AND THEN THE SECOND

04:43:52.715 --> 04:43:54.150
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD IS

04:43:54.217 --> 04:43:55.251
WHY -- BY

04:43:55.318 --> 04:43:57.353
REDUCING THE I JUST SIZE COUNTY

04:43:57.420 --> 04:44:00.089
COSTS THAT THEN SHIFTS COSTS A

04:44:00.156 --> 04:44:01.157
GREATER AMOUNT OF BY JUST AS

04:44:01.224 --> 04:44:02.558
COST TO THE STATE AND WE FIND

04:44:02.625 --> 04:44:04.460
THIS APPROPRIATE --

04:44:04.527 --> 04:44:05.661
HOWEVER THIS DOES RAISE

04:44:05.728 --> 04:44:07.096
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEN THE STATE'S

04:44:07.163 --> 04:44:09.499
ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS BUT

04:44:09.565 --> 04:44:10.833
THEN ALSO --

04:44:10.900 --> 04:44:12.168
LOOKING AT COST PRESSURES

04:44:12.235 --> 04:44:13.369
ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGING

04:44:13.436 --> 04:44:15.304
POPULATION THAT WE MAY SEE AND I

04:44:15.371 --> 04:44:16.539

04:44:16.606 --> 04:44:18.141
CONVERSATIONS WE HAD EARLIER IN

THIS HEARING THIS CONVERSATION

04:44:19.542 --> 04:44:20.143
ABOUT.

04:44:20.209 --> 04:44:21.978
HOW DO WE PLAN FOR THE IMPACT OF

04:44:22.044 --> 04:44:23.446
THE GROWING AGING POPULATION IN

04:44:23.513 --> 04:44:27.150
THE STATE BUDGET --

04:44:27.216 --> 04:44:28.151
FITS IN WITH US AS WELL

COMMENTS RELATIVE.

04:44:52.542 --> 04:44:53.576
TO WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH OVER

04:44:53.643 --> 04:44:54.644
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE

04:44:54.710 --> 04:44:56.612
WE SIT TODAY AND HOW WE SEE THE

04:44:56.679 --> 04:44:58.214
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

04:44:58.281 --> 04:44:58.948
AND ALL ACTUALLY BEGIN WITH THE

04:44:59.015 --> 04:45:01.851

WERE THANKFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

04:45:04.086 --> 04:45:06.489

ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND --

04:45:08.991 --> 04:45:10.460
TO STABILIZE A PROGRAM IN THE

04:45:10.526 --> 04:45:11.761
STABILIZE THE OVERALL

04:45:11.828 --> 04:45:14.197
REALIGNMENT.

04:45:14.263 --> 04:45:16.432
AS AS COUNTIES WE ARE STEWARDS

04:45:16.499 --> 04:45:18.468
OF A NUMBER OF STATE PROGRAMS

04:45:18.534 --> 04:45:20.069
THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE --

04:45:20.136 --> 04:45:20.703
WITH -- WITH

04:45:20.770 --> 04:45:22.104
AYE TO ASSESS --

04:45:22.171 --> 04:45:23.439
WE'RE PROUD TO STAND WITH THE

04:45:23.506 --> 04:45:24.740
STATE AS A PARTNER IN

04:45:24.807 --> 04:45:26.409
ADMINISTERING THE I JUST AS

04:45:26.476 --> 04:45:27.210
PROGRAM.

04:45:27.276 --> 04:45:29.212
I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MORE

04:45:29.278 --> 04:45:30.446
THAN HALF A MILLION FOLKS AT

04:45:30.513 --> 04:45:32.315
THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY SUIT

04:45:32.381 --> 04:45:33.382
TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN.

04:45:33.449 --> 04:45:35.451
SAFELY REMAIN --

04:45:35.518 --> 04:45:36.652
WITHIN THEIR HOMES.

04:45:36.719 --> 04:45:38.654
WHEN WE THINK BACK TO WHERE WE

04:45:38.721 --> 04:45:42.058
WERE IN --

04:45:42.125 --> 04:45:42.658
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WE

04:45:42.725 --> 04:45:44.126
NEGOTIATED WITH THE LEGISLATURE

04:45:44.193 --> 04:45:46.395
IN ADMINISTRATION.

04:45:46.462 --> 04:45:49.732
I'M A COUNTY I JUST US AND WE

04:45:49.799 --> 04:45:51.334
THAT -- THAT --

04:45:51.400 --> 04:45:53.703
WHO HAD A TWO YEAR RE

04:45:53.769 --> 04:45:55.304
EXAMINATION IN TERMS OF WHERE WE

04:45:55.371 --> 04:45:56.672
WERE AT --

04:45:56.739 --> 04:45:59.075
AND THAT PROVISION --

04:45:59.141 --> 04:46:01.944
FOR US IS CRITICAL TO THAT AS WE

04:46:02.011 --> 04:46:03.579
WERE GOING THROUGH A NEW MODEL

04:46:03.646 --> 04:46:05.214
WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

04:46:05.281 --> 04:46:06.048
CHANGE.

04:46:06.115 --> 04:46:08.784
THAT WE KEPT IN MIND.

04:46:08.851 --> 04:46:09.952
THE RISK SHARING --

04:46:10.019 --> 04:46:11.287
THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE STATE

04:46:11.354 --> 04:46:13.055
AND COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT FROM

04:46:13.122 --> 04:46:14.891
A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE --

04:46:14.957 --> 04:46:16.993
WE COULD HAVE SUSTAINABILITY OF

04:46:17.059 --> 04:46:19.495
PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE --

04:46:19.562 --> 04:46:21.430
ACCESS TO DELIVER ON THEIR

04:46:21.497 --> 04:46:22.632
BEHALF.

04:46:22.698 --> 04:46:23.900
SO THIS.

04:46:23.966 --> 04:46:26.302
THIS RE EXAMINATION WAS REALLY

04:46:26.369 --> 04:46:28.704
FOCUSED ON THAT BALANCE POINT OF

04:46:28.771 --> 04:46:29.972
INSURING --

04:46:30.039 --> 04:46:33.009
APPROPRIATE SHARED RISK BETWEEN

04:46:33.075 --> 04:46:34.210
THE STATE AND COUNTIES.

04:46:34.277 --> 04:46:39.515
BUT AS WE WALKED IN --

04:46:39.582 --> 04:46:40.383
220-001-71718 AT THE BEGINNING

04:46:40.449 --> 04:46:42.752
THIS AM A WE WE HAD --

04:46:42.818 --> 04:46:44.520
CONFIDENCE THAT IN THE FIRST

04:46:44.587 --> 04:46:46.889
COUPLE OF YEARS WE COULD MANAGE

04:46:46.956 --> 04:46:48.824
THROUGH WITH THE ANIMAL WE

04:46:48.891 --> 04:46:51.327
WITHOUT I'M SEVERE DISRUPTION

04:46:51.394 --> 04:46:52.461
RELATED TO PROGRAMS.

04:46:52.528 --> 04:46:53.763
I'M NOT WITHSTANDING THE

04:46:53.829 --> 04:46:55.331
REDIRECTION OF BOTH PUBLIC

04:46:55.398 --> 04:46:57.166
HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED

04:46:57.233 --> 04:47:00.169
FUNDING WITHIN THE REALIGNMENT.

04:47:00.236 --> 04:47:01.337
BUT WE ALSO KNEW THAT.

04:47:01.404 --> 04:47:03.806
AS WE GOT TO TWO THOUSAND

04:47:03.873 --> 04:47:04.807
NINETEEN TWENTY AND BEYOND.

04:47:04.874 --> 04:47:06.976
THAT THE COST WOULD INCREASE AT

04:47:07.043 --> 04:47:08.544
A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN THE

04:47:08.611 --> 04:47:12.682
REVENUES THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE --

04:47:12.748 --> 04:47:14.417
TWO TO FUND THOSE COSTS AND SO

04:47:14.483 --> 04:47:16.152
THIS IS WHERE --

04:47:16.218 --> 04:47:19.255
WE ALONG WITH THE SO HAVE A VERY

04:47:19.322 --> 04:47:20.890
SIMILAR ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OF

04:47:20.957 --> 04:47:21.757
WHERE THINGS WERE.

04:47:21.824 --> 04:47:24.360
WE'RE GOING.

04:47:24.427 --> 04:47:26.195
SINCE OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

04:47:26.262 --> 04:47:27.096
COUNTIES HAVE.

04:47:27.163 --> 04:47:29.131
WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PARTNER

04:47:29.198 --> 04:47:31.000
WITH THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT --

04:47:31.067 --> 04:47:32.969
THE ANIMAL WE I DO WANT TO

04:47:33.035 --> 04:47:34.937
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS

04:47:35.004 --> 04:47:36.539
OF THE EMMA WE THAT.

04:47:36.606 --> 04:47:39.442
WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH --

04:47:39.508 --> 04:47:41.577
THAT TO LEAD US UP --

04:47:41.644 --> 04:47:43.746
TO TO THIS PROPOSAL.

04:47:43.813 --> 04:47:44.614
THE FIRST IS THAT.

04:47:44.680 --> 04:47:46.215
THE INCREASE COSTS THAT WERE

04:47:46.282 --> 04:47:48.584
TRANSFERRED UP TO COUNTIES --

04:47:48.651 --> 04:47:49.752
OCCURRED IN A COUPLE OF

04:47:49.819 --> 04:47:51.020
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO THERE'S

04:47:51.087 --> 04:47:52.555
THOSE THINGS --

04:47:52.622 --> 04:47:54.757
ATTRIBUTED TO REGULAR PROGRAM

04:47:54.824 --> 04:47:56.058
CASE SLOW GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM

04:47:56.125 --> 04:47:59.328
WHICH IS ABOUT 4% --

04:47:59.395 --> 04:48:00.696
AND THEN --

04:48:00.763 --> 04:48:02.098
CHANGES THAT OCCUR THAT WERE

04:48:02.164 --> 04:48:03.499
OUTSIDE OF COUNTY CONTROL THAT

04:48:03.566 --> 04:48:04.634
DEAL WITH --

04:48:04.700 --> 04:48:06.902
STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND

04:48:06.969 --> 04:48:08.371
ALSO DEAL WITH THE

04:48:08.437 --> 04:48:10.406
IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL --

04:48:10.473 --> 04:48:13.409
OVERTIME RELATED RULES BECAUSE

04:48:13.476 --> 04:48:15.811
OF THOSE INCREASED COSTS --

04:48:15.878 --> 04:48:17.179
BEING FAR HIGHER THAN THE

04:48:17.246 --> 04:48:19.548
REVENUES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE

04:48:19.615 --> 04:48:21.517
REALIGNMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE

04:48:21.584 --> 04:48:24.220
M. A WE WORKABLE AND THIS IS

04:48:24.286 --> 04:48:26.522
WHERE THAT REDIRECTION OF PUBLIC

04:48:26.589 --> 04:48:28.190
HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED.

04:48:28.257 --> 04:48:29.091
I'M REVENUE --

04:48:29.158 --> 04:48:31.293
OCCURRED.

04:48:31.360 --> 04:48:33.396
SO WE WE KNEW WE COULD WIN

04:48:33.462 --> 04:48:34.697
THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE OF

04:48:34.764 --> 04:48:36.065
YEARS BUT THAT THAT WAS NOT

04:48:36.132 --> 04:48:37.433
SUSTAINABLE.

04:48:37.500 --> 04:48:39.702
WHICH IS WHY I'M WITHOUT AS

04:48:39.769 --> 04:48:41.103
SIGNIFICAN INTERVENTION WE'VE

04:48:41.170 --> 04:48:43.806
KNOWN THAT WE'VE BEEN HEADED.

04:48:43.873 --> 04:48:46.008
FOR THIS CLIP AS THE STATE

04:48:46.075 --> 04:48:47.677
GENERAL FUND WAS OTHERWISE

04:48:47.743 --> 04:48:50.913
SLATED TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS

04:48:50.980 --> 04:48:52.748
OUR COSTS --

04:48:52.815 --> 04:48:53.683
ACTUALLY WENT UP.

04:48:53.749 --> 04:48:57.620
SO WITHIN THIS CONTEXT --

04:48:57.687 --> 04:49:00.256
COUNTIES HAVE UTILIZED SOME OF

04:49:00.322 --> 04:49:02.892
THE NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

04:49:02.958 --> 04:49:04.160
JURORS AND TOOLS THAT WERE PUT

04:49:04.226 --> 04:49:05.494
IN PLACE --

04:49:05.561 --> 04:49:06.996
TO MAKE SOME FOR PROGRESS

04:49:07.063 --> 04:49:08.431
RELATIVE.

04:49:08.497 --> 04:49:09.799
TO LABOR AGREEMENTS AT THE LOCAL

04:49:09.865 --> 04:49:12.268
LEVEL -- FOR

04:49:12.334 --> 04:49:14.236
ARE I TO ASSESS --

04:49:14.303 --> 04:49:16.005
PROVIDERS --

04:49:16.072 --> 04:49:17.039
AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE

04:49:17.106 --> 04:49:18.874
WITH THE UTILIZING OF THE WAGE

04:49:18.941 --> 04:49:20.342
SUPPLEMENT AND ADDITIONAL STATE

04:49:20.409 --> 04:49:23.846
SHARON AND I'M SO WE'VE MADE

04:49:23.913 --> 04:49:26.148
SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

04:49:26.215 --> 04:49:28.050
WITH THIS --

04:49:28.117 --> 04:49:29.285
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REPORT IN

04:49:29.351 --> 04:49:30.686
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT'S

04:49:30.753 --> 04:49:32.955
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUT

04:49:33.022 --> 04:49:34.356
NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET.

04:49:34.423 --> 04:49:35.024
I'M WERE ABLE TO BRING SOME

04:49:35.091 --> 04:49:38.394
STABILITY TO NOT JUST A TO SAYS

04:49:38.461 --> 04:49:41.263
BUT ALSO TO THE REALIGNMENT --

04:49:41.330 --> 04:49:42.865
MORE BROADLY --

04:49:42.932 --> 04:49:46.502
AND AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY BOTH

04:49:46.569 --> 04:49:47.803
THE MINISTRATION ELIO --

04:49:47.870 --> 04:49:49.338
STOP THE REDIRECTION OF REVENUE

04:49:49.405 --> 04:49:51.774
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL

04:49:51.841 --> 04:49:53.275
HEALTH SERVICES --

04:49:53.342 --> 04:49:55.211
TO ENSURE THAT CHEMICAL DISEASE

04:49:55.277 --> 04:49:56.412
CONTROL --

04:49:56.479 --> 04:49:57.747
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE

04:49:57.813 --> 04:49:59.381
RELATED EFFORTS CAN CONTINUE TO

04:49:59.448 --> 04:50:02.885
BE FUNDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

04:50:02.952 --> 04:50:04.620
AND SO I WANT.

04:50:04.687 --> 04:50:06.055
TO ACKNOWLEDGE --

04:50:06.122 --> 04:50:08.457
THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING

04:50:08.524 --> 04:50:12.394
SO CLOSELY WITH US --

04:50:12.461 --> 04:50:14.263
FOR BOTH HEARING OUR CONCERNS --

04:50:14.330 --> 04:50:17.600
AND I'M PUTTING A PROPOSAL IN

04:50:17.666 --> 04:50:18.667
THE BUDGET.

04:50:18.734 --> 04:50:19.301
THAT --

04:50:19.368 --> 04:50:20.703
STABILIZES --

04:50:20.770 --> 04:50:23.305
HEIGHTS ASSESSES THE PROGRAM --

04:50:23.372 --> 04:50:25.341
PROVIDES A SUSTAINABILITY IN

04:50:25.407 --> 04:50:26.976
TERMS OF THE OVERALL REALIGNMENT --

04:50:27.042 --> 04:50:29.512
CLEARLY AS A LA APPOINTED.

04:50:29.578 --> 04:50:31.180
THIS IS STILL A SHARED RISK

04:50:31.247 --> 04:50:32.681
MODEL AND SO THERE IS --

04:50:32.748 --> 04:50:34.083
REMAINING RISK WITH ON THE

04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:35.785
COUNTY SIDE JUST AS THERE IS ON

04:50:35.851 --> 04:50:37.186
THE STATE SIDE.

04:50:37.253 --> 04:50:38.587
AS WELL --

04:50:38.654 --> 04:50:41.924
BUT WE SEE THIS PROPOSAL AS FAIR

04:50:41.991 --> 04:50:45.094
AND BALANCED IN TERMS OF

04:50:45.161 --> 04:50:46.796
PROVIDING THAT STABILITY I'M

04:50:46.862 --> 04:50:50.199
RECOGNIZING THAT OF WHICH COSTS

04:50:50.266 --> 04:50:51.700
CAN BE CONTROLLED AND BY WHOM.

04:50:51.767 --> 04:50:54.069
AND AS A RESULT WERE STRONGLY IN

04:50:54.136 --> 04:50:56.338
SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND WHEN

04:50:56.405 --> 04:50:58.007
YOU CAN ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE

04:50:58.073 --> 04:51:00.976
TO MOVE IT FORWARD AS WELL.

04:51:01.043 --> 04:51:03.979
RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL.

04:51:04.046 --> 04:51:05.414
FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS --

04:51:05.481 --> 04:51:06.415
I THINK THAT --

04:51:06.482 --> 04:51:09.285
WHEN MY THINGS AS WE LOOK AT --

04:51:09.351 --> 04:51:11.120
REALIGNMENT I APPRECIATE I THINK

04:51:11.187 --> 04:51:12.087
I AGREE THAT --

04:51:12.154 --> 04:51:13.422
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS

04:51:13.489 --> 04:51:14.723
MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

04:51:14.790 --> 04:51:18.694
AB REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THE

04:51:18.761 --> 04:51:19.962
YOU KNOW WHO'S BEARING THE

04:51:20.029 --> 04:51:21.430
FINANCIAL BURDEN.

04:51:21.497 --> 04:51:22.832
WHO ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OVER

04:51:22.898 --> 04:51:23.866
THE COSTS LIKE THE WORST

04:51:23.933 --> 04:51:25.067
SITUATION IS THAT YOU HAVE AN

04:51:25.134 --> 04:51:27.102
EXPENSE THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL

04:51:27.169 --> 04:51:29.238
YOU DON'T HAVE THE AND THEN YOU

04:51:29.305 --> 04:51:30.306
DON'T AND?

04:51:30.372 --> 04:51:31.440
AND ALSO TIED TO A REVENUE

04:51:31.507 --> 04:51:32.942
STREAM THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T

04:51:33.008 --> 04:51:35.144
MANAGE EITHER RIGHT SO --

04:51:35.211 --> 04:51:36.645
FOR EXAMPLE --

04:51:36.712 --> 04:51:38.380
WELL AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME OF

04:51:38.447 --> 04:51:39.915
RALEIGH VLS IT'S NOT LIKE A

04:51:39.982 --> 04:51:41.517
COUNTY CAN REYES STIR FEEL

04:51:41.584 --> 04:51:43.319
LASSIE SEPARATELY FROM OTHER

04:51:43.385 --> 04:51:44.687
COUNTIES RIGHT IF I DON'THAVE A

04:51:44.753 --> 04:51:45.821
FEEL LEFT REVENUE ARE JUST

04:51:45.888 --> 04:51:47.556
RAISED VEAL A FEW MY COUNTY

04:51:47.623 --> 04:51:47.957
RIGHT.

04:51:48.023 --> 04:51:49.458
THAT'S THAT'S THAT SAID IT STATE

04:51:49.525 --> 04:51:51.861
RIGHT SO THAT VLF MONEY.

04:51:51.927 --> 04:51:53.095
HOW MUCH YOU GONNA GET PART OF

04:51:53.162 --> 04:51:54.430
IT'S A TEN OF COURSE ON HOW MANY

04:51:54.496 --> 04:51:56.131
CARS YOU HOUSE RIGHT WHICH YOU

04:51:56.198 --> 04:51:57.366
DON'T DECIDE EITHER YOU CAN'T

04:51:57.433 --> 04:51:58.701
TAKE PEOPLE BUYER MORE OR LESS

04:51:58.767 --> 04:52:00.336
CARS IN YOUR COUNTY OR OUR OWN

04:52:00.402 --> 04:52:02.137
MORE OR LESS CARS AND CUT IT

04:52:02.204 --> 04:52:02.805
SHOULD SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE?

04:52:02.872 --> 04:52:03.672
IN THE PAPER.

04:52:03.739 --> 04:52:04.773
BUT THEN ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IS

04:52:04.840 --> 04:52:06.842
THAT WE SET THE FEET RIGHT SO

04:52:06.909 --> 04:52:08.277
THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT SO THAT

04:52:08.344 --> 04:52:10.679
YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT

04:52:10.746 --> 04:52:11.213
GREAT.

04:52:11.280 --> 04:52:12.481
SALES TAX A LITTLE DIFFERENT

04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:13.883
YOLO CONTROL YOU COULD YOU KNOW

04:52:13.949 --> 04:52:15.451
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU GO BACK TO YOUR

04:52:15.518 --> 04:52:16.051
VOTERS AND SO FORTH PERSUADE

04:52:16.118 --> 04:52:22.091
PEOPLE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A

04:52:22.157 --> 04:52:23.092
LITTLE BIT.

04:52:23.158 --> 04:52:23.626
SO -- SO I

04:52:23.692 --> 04:52:24.293
MEAN AS WE LOOK AT THAT AND THEN

04:52:24.360 --> 04:52:24.994
ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE

04:52:25.060 --> 04:52:25.828
DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS RATES OF

04:52:25.895 --> 04:52:26.695
FOR EXAMPLE I HSS WON THE THINGS

04:52:26.762 --> 04:52:28.163
THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS

04:52:28.230 --> 04:52:28.998
THAT OUR INVESTMENT AYE HSS.

04:52:29.064 --> 04:52:30.366
ALSO ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY

04:52:30.432 --> 04:52:32.134
POTENTIALLY LOWER AND WE'VE DONE

04:52:32.201 --> 04:52:33.502
STUDIES WHICH LOOKED AT THIS

04:52:33.569 --> 04:52:35.671
LOWER SOME OF THE STATE SPENDING

04:52:35.738 --> 04:52:38.874
ON INSTITUTIONS RIGHT WHICH IS

04:52:38.941 --> 04:52:40.242
ACTUALLY COST US FOR BY THE

04:52:40.309 --> 04:52:43.245
STATE NOT BY COUNTY SO --

04:52:43.312 --> 04:52:45.581
SO IT'S GOOD THAT THE STATE HAS

04:52:45.648 --> 04:52:47.149
DAVE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE RE

04:52:47.216 --> 04:52:48.384
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS IT

04:52:48.450 --> 04:52:49.885
MAKES SENSE FOR US BECAUSE WE

04:52:49.952 --> 04:52:50.953
ACTUALLY CAN REDUCE OUR COSTS IN

04:52:51.020 --> 04:52:51.954
THE SIDE WHERE IS THE COUNTIES

04:52:52.021 --> 04:52:53.289
LIKE WELL WE'LL WE CAN.

04:52:53.355 --> 04:52:54.924
PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT AND SAVE

04:52:54.990 --> 04:52:56.292
MONEY BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY OF

04:52:56.358 --> 04:52:57.960
THAT SAVINGS RIGHT SO THINKING

04:52:58.027 --> 04:52:58.994
ABOUT HOW THAT I REALIZE THESE

04:52:59.061 --> 04:53:01.030
ARE MULTIPLE THREADS THAT RUN

04:53:01.096 --> 04:53:02.665
THROUGH THINGS BUT NOW THAT THAT

04:53:02.731 --> 04:53:03.899
IS WHAT IT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:53:03.966 --> 04:53:05.167
THIS I KNOW THAT BACK IN.

04:53:05.234 --> 04:53:06.635
WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS

04:53:06.702 --> 04:53:08.437
COUPLE YEARS AGO AND A DEAL DID

04:53:08.504 --> 04:53:09.371
COME TOGETHER?

04:53:09.438 --> 04:53:11.307
KNIVES CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THESE

04:53:11.373 --> 04:53:12.708
THINGS INTERPLAY AND WHERE'D

04:53:12.775 --> 04:53:15.110
INCENTIVES BEING CUT RIGHT FOR

04:53:15.177 --> 04:53:16.111
FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTIES THE

04:53:16.178 --> 04:53:18.347
STATE THE COUNTIES AND SO FORTH

04:53:18.414 --> 04:53:20.182
IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT.

04:53:20.249 --> 04:53:22.217
YOU DON'T HAVE --

04:53:22.284 --> 04:53:23.886
I GUESS --

04:53:23.953 --> 04:53:24.720
YEAH.

04:53:24.787 --> 04:53:25.688
WELL ATTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE

04:53:25.754 --> 04:53:27.523
MISALIGNED INCENTIVES RATE IN

04:53:27.589 --> 04:53:29.224
TERMS OF TRYING TO TO CHEAT THE

04:53:29.291 --> 04:53:30.893
CHEMICALS MY CHIEF WITH WITH THE

04:53:30.960 --> 04:53:32.061
PROGRAM.

04:53:32.127 --> 04:53:33.595
AND SO I DO THINK THIS IS MOVING

04:53:33.662 --> 04:53:36.231
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION --

04:53:36.298 --> 04:53:37.800
I CLEARLY IT DOES PUT A GREATER

04:53:37.866 --> 04:53:39.835
BURDEN ON YOU KNOW THE STATE

04:53:39.902 --> 04:53:42.071
WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE TO SAY

04:53:42.137 --> 04:53:42.738
THE OKAY HOW WE GONNA FIGURE OUT

04:53:42.805 --> 04:53:43.272
WE HAVE.

04:53:43.339 --> 04:53:44.974
YOU HERE WE HAVE LOTS PROPOSALS

04:53:45.040 --> 04:53:46.775
FOR THINGS PEOPLE WANT IT TO GET

04:53:46.842 --> 04:53:48.477
FUNDED RIGHT OUT THERE AND AND

04:53:48.544 --> 04:53:49.645
WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING ON AN

04:53:49.712 --> 04:53:51.580
ONGOING BASIS OF LARGE PORTION

04:53:51.647 --> 04:53:54.016
OF THE AYE HSS RATE SO THAT

04:53:54.083 --> 04:53:55.351
MEANS THAT ON STATE SIDE.

04:53:55.417 --> 04:53:57.319
BARRING ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT

04:53:57.386 --> 04:53:58.954
PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON ANY OTHER

04:53:59.021 --> 04:54:02.524
PROGRAM THE STATE FUNDS AS WELL --

04:54:02.591 --> 04:54:05.627
BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING COUNTIES AT

04:54:05.694 --> 04:54:07.096
SQUEEZE OUT OTHER THINGS SO WE

04:54:07.162 --> 04:54:09.231
HAD A HEARING ON PUBLIC HEALTH

04:54:09.298 --> 04:54:10.766
AND WILL DELVE MORE DEBT LATER

04:54:10.833 --> 04:54:12.267
WE HAVE HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH

04:54:12.334 --> 04:54:12.468
RIGHT.

04:54:12.534 --> 04:54:14.203
AND SO WHEN THAT.

04:54:14.269 --> 04:54:15.637
LATER LIVE OF A RUN DOWN THERE'S

04:54:15.704 --> 04:54:17.606
NOBODY GOING THERE WELL WHAT'S

04:54:17.673 --> 04:54:19.775
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN RIGHT SO --

04:54:19.842 --> 04:54:20.909
SO I THINK THAT --

04:54:20.976 --> 04:54:22.077
SO I DO APPRECIATE --

04:54:22.144 --> 04:54:23.412
THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

04:54:23.479 --> 04:54:25.280
PROPOSAL I THINK AS WE CONTINUE

04:54:25.347 --> 04:54:26.548
TO BEFORE WE NEED TO LOOK AT I

04:54:26.615 --> 04:54:30.419
THINK IS MENTIONED EXACTLY.

04:54:30.486 --> 04:54:32.154
WELLS WAS WAY [inaudible]

04:54:32.221 --> 04:54:33.689
WE'RE FUNDING.

04:54:33.756 --> 04:54:35.357
HSS BUT THE DEMAND FOR

04:54:35.424 --> 04:54:36.925
RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT AT LEAST I

04:54:36.992 --> 04:54:38.961
KNOW OF MAYBE SOMEONE DID MIKE

04:54:39.028 --> 04:54:41.130
MACRO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS IS TIED

04:54:41.196 --> 04:54:42.698
TO THE NUMBER OF CARS IN A

04:54:42.765 --> 04:54:43.866
PARTICULAR LOCATION OR THE

04:54:43.932 --> 04:54:45.667
AMOUNT OF RETAIL SALES THAT

04:54:45.734 --> 04:54:47.102
HAPPENS IN IN A COUNTY RIGHT.

04:54:47.169 --> 04:54:48.470
SO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

04:54:48.537 --> 04:54:51.106
FUNDING SOURCE AND THE AND

04:54:51.173 --> 04:54:53.242
WHAT'S PAYING FOR IS NOT

04:54:53.308 --> 04:54:54.610
NECESSARILY YOU YOU KNOW THAT

04:54:54.676 --> 04:54:55.511
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED

04:54:55.577 --> 04:54:57.012
THAT WAY AND THAT NOT.

04:54:57.079 --> 04:54:58.113
SO -- WE

04:54:58.180 --> 04:54:59.782
HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE FUNDING

04:54:59.848 --> 04:55:02.418
STREAM MAILED IS IS IS IS GOING

04:55:02.484 --> 04:55:04.119
TO BE ADEQUATE ON AN ONGOING

04:55:04.186 --> 04:55:06.622
BASIS OVER TIME SO WE NEED TO

04:55:06.688 --> 04:55:07.923
CERTAINLY MONITOR THAT.

04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:09.124
SHE LOKED OVER TIME AND

04:55:09.191 --> 04:55:09.992
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THE

04:55:10.059 --> 04:55:11.060
STATE HAS TO LOOK AT AS WELL

04:55:11.126 --> 04:55:12.661
WERE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON INCOME

04:55:12.728 --> 04:55:14.263
TAX REVENUE --

04:55:14.329 --> 04:55:15.798
CAPITAL GAINS REVENUE SO WE HAVE

04:55:15.864 --> 04:55:18.300
A MORE VOLATILE WE'RE TRYING --

04:55:18.367 --> 04:55:21.403
TO AND I APPRECIATE GOVERNOR

04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:23.772
BROWN THIS IS LEADERS AND

04:55:23.839 --> 04:55:24.973
CERTAINLY STEPS WE'VE TAKEN THE

04:55:25.040 --> 04:55:26.442
LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO BE SURE WE

04:55:26.508 --> 04:55:28.010
CAN -- LEVEL

04:55:28.077 --> 04:55:30.179
OUT THE BULBS SAID TO THE DEGREE

04:55:30.245 --> 04:55:32.481
WE CAN -- TO

04:55:32.548 --> 04:55:33.315
BECAUSE RECOGNIZING WHAT WE

04:55:33.382 --> 04:55:35.184
SPEND THINGS ON ACTUALLY FIRST

04:55:35.250 --> 04:55:36.485
OF ALL GENERALLY TENDS TO BE

04:55:36.552 --> 04:55:38.087
MORE CONSTANT IN A REVENUE

04:55:38.153 --> 04:55:39.788
STREAM AND ALSO TENDS TO BE

04:55:39.855 --> 04:55:41.256
SOMEWHAT COUNTER CYCLICALS WELL

04:55:41.323 --> 04:55:43.425
SO THE DEMAND GOES UP WHEN OUR

04:55:43.492 --> 04:55:44.493
REVENUES ARE DOWN.

04:55:44.560 --> 04:55:45.961
SO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE ALL

04:55:46.028 --> 04:55:47.896
THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES IS --

04:55:47.963 --> 04:55:48.931
SOMETHING THAT --

04:55:48.997 --> 04:55:50.666

DID BEFORE --

04:56:03.879 --> 04:56:05.214

04:56:05.280 --> 04:56:08.016

FINANCING MECHANISM. TO MEET

05:07:25.794 --> 05:07:28.396
THIS GROWING NEED --

05:07:28.463 --> 05:07:29.998
JUST FOR CONTEXT CALIFORNIA HAS

05:07:30.064 --> 05:07:31.533
ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PERSONS WHO

05:07:31.599 --> 05:07:32.801

FOR LONG TERM SERVICES FOR SELF

05:07:50.685 --> 05:07:52.420
FILL THE GAP.

05:07:52.487 --> 05:07:53.421
BUT THESE SERVICES BRING HIGH

05:07:53.488 --> 05:07:54.589
COSTS NOT ONLY TO THE

05:07:54.656 --> 05:07:55.924
INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY INVOLVED

BUT ALSO TO THE TAXPAYERS IN THE

05:07:57.358 --> 05:07:58.226
GOVERNMENT.

05:07:58.293 --> 05:07:59.561
AS MORE INDIVIDUALS ARE FORCED

05:07:59.627 --> 05:08:01.095
TO SPEND DOWN ASSETS TO QUALIFY

05:08:01.162 --> 05:08:02.564

05:08:02.630 --> 05:08:03.731
ACCOUNT SYSTEM.

05:08:03.798 --> 05:08:05.667
I'M SURE MOST INDIVIDUALS AWARE

05:08:05.733 --> 05:08:07.869
THAT MEDICARE DOES NOT COVER --

05:08:07.936 --> 05:08:09.270

SUPPORTS.

05:08:13.675 --> 05:08:14.809
AND AS AS THIS HAS BEEN

05:08:14.876 --> 05:08:15.677
DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT TODAY WE

05:08:15.743 --> 05:08:16.211
KNOW THAT LONG TERM CARE

SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET REQUEST

05:08:32.994 --> 05:08:34.195
FOR THE VARIOUS REASONS EXPRESS

05:08:34.262 --> 05:08:35.597
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW ALL TOO

05:08:35.663 --> 05:08:37.866

ON THE AYE HSS PROGRAM.

05:08:39.667 --> 05:08:41.002
FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN INDIVIDUALS

05:08:41.069 --> 05:08:42.170
REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY NEED

05:08:42.237 --> 05:08:43.705
LONG TERM CARE --

05:08:43.771 --> 05:08:44.906

CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR

05:08:55.383 --> 05:08:56.818

05:08:56.885 --> 05:08:57.852
THAT IT'S THE VISION OF THE

05:08:57.919 --> 05:08:59.320

COUNTIES THE OF AYE HSS

05:21:20.894 --> 05:21:23.430
PROVIDERS I DISTRIBUTED TO THE

05:21:23.497 --> 05:21:27.301

BARGAINING STATUS IN OUR TWENTY

05:21:30.571 --> 05:21:31.438
ONE COUNTIES.

05:21:31.505 --> 05:21:33.374
SO WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

05:21:33.440 --> 05:21:36.010
TODAY GIVING ATTENTION TO THE

05:21:36.076 --> 05:21:37.444
LONG TERM CARE CRISIS.

05:21:37.511 --> 05:21:38.979
I BELIEVE WHAT ARE PROPOSAL

05:21:39.046 --> 05:21:41.115
ADDRESSES IS ANOTHER LINK IN

05:21:41.181 --> 05:21:43.951
THAT CHAIN WHICH IS PROVIDER PAY.

05:21:44.018 --> 05:21:45.619
AND THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT

05:21:45.686 --> 05:21:49.323
RECRUIT AND WORK WHEN ALL YOU DO

05:21:49.390 --> 05:21:50.691
IS PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE.

05:21:50.758 --> 05:21:52.626
THEY CAN GO WORK ANY OTHER JOB

05:21:52.693 --> 05:21:54.128
THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

05:21:54.194 --> 05:21:55.763
STRESSFUL AND LESS DIFFICULT.

05:21:55.829 --> 05:21:57.898
AND PROBABLY GET PAID MORE AND

05:21:57.965 --> 05:21:59.299
PROBABLY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH

05:21:59.366 --> 05:22:00.801
BENEFITS.

05:22:00.868 --> 05:22:02.903
I JUST AS PROVIDERS AS YOU CAN

05:22:02.970 --> 05:22:05.606
SEE IN THE IN THE COUNTIES

05:22:05.673 --> 05:22:06.774
HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN.

05:22:06.840 --> 05:22:08.042
WE ONLY HAVE SIX COUNTIES

05:22:08.108 --> 05:22:09.877
CURRENTLY OUT OF TWENTY ONE THAT

05:22:09.943 --> 05:22:11.578
PAY OVER MINIMUM WAGE.

05:22:11.645 --> 05:22:13.147
THE COUNTIES HIGHLIGHTED IN

05:22:13.213 --> 05:22:15.082
YELLOW ARE COUNTIES THAT DO NOT

05:22:15.149 --> 05:22:16.450
HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

05:22:16.517 --> 05:22:17.751
AGREEMENTS IN PLACE.

05:22:17.818 --> 05:22:20.521
AND SO YOU CAN SEE OUT OF

05:22:20.587 --> 05:22:22.623
THERE'S SIX ONLY SIX COUNTIES

05:22:22.690 --> 05:22:24.124
OUT OF TWENTY ONE HAVE

05:22:24.191 --> 05:22:25.926
AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

05:22:25.993 --> 05:22:26.960
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

05:22:27.027 --> 05:22:28.929
CALL AND YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE

05:22:28.996 --> 05:22:30.931
TIME SINKS SINCE THAT AGREEMENT

05:22:30.998 --> 05:22:33.200
HAS BEEN EXPIRED IS ALMOST THREE

05:22:33.267 --> 05:22:34.034
YEARS.

05:22:34.101 --> 05:22:35.736
AND THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME

05:22:35.803 --> 05:22:37.337
SINCE EIGHTY NEGOTIATED WAGE

05:22:37.404 --> 05:22:40.040
INCREASE OCCURRED IS CLOSEST TO

05:22:40.107 --> 05:22:41.709
FOR YEARS I WANT TO POINT OUT

05:22:41.775 --> 05:22:43.911
BECAUSE I REALIZE THIS AFTER I I

05:22:43.977 --> 05:22:44.611
PUT THE CHART TOGETHER.

05:22:44.678 --> 05:22:45.279
THAT.

05:22:45.345 --> 05:22:46.747
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE FACT

05:22:46.814 --> 05:22:47.648
THAT MOST OF THOSE WAGE

05:22:47.715 --> 05:22:49.516
INCREASES THAT HAPPENS SO IF YOU

05:22:49.583 --> 05:22:51.285
LOOK AT THE COLUMN IN THE MIDDLE

05:22:51.351 --> 05:22:52.753
THAT SAYS LASTING INCREASE.

05:22:52.820 --> 05:22:54.388
MOST OF THOSE INCREASES WERE

05:22:54.455 --> 05:22:56.690
PURELY THE TRANSFER OF THE

05:22:56.757 --> 05:22:58.459
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WERE

05:22:58.525 --> 05:22:59.827
SPENT ON HEALTH BENEFITS.

05:22:59.893 --> 05:23:01.762
BEING PUT TOWARD WAGES SO THAT

05:23:01.829 --> 05:23:03.697
THERE WAS NO ACTUAL COST TO THAT

05:23:03.764 --> 05:23:05.599
AND THE REASON WHY THAT HAPPENED

05:23:05.666 --> 05:23:06.366
WAS THAT WAS WHEN THE AFFORDABLE

05:23:06.433 --> 05:23:08.035
CARE ACT PASSED.

05:23:08.102 --> 05:23:09.470
AND MEDICAID EXPANSION HAPPENED

05:23:09.536 --> 05:23:12.005
WHICH MEANT WHICH MEANT THAT

05:23:12.072 --> 05:23:13.707
MOST OF THOSE WORKERS WERE GOING

05:23:13.774 --> 05:23:14.508
TO BE ABLE TO GET ON TO MEDIC

05:23:14.575 --> 05:23:15.242
HAL.

05:23:15.309 --> 05:23:16.443
SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GOT

05:23:16.510 --> 05:23:18.412
THOSE INCREASES WAS BY TAKING

05:23:18.479 --> 05:23:20.180
MONEY OUT OF HEALTH BENEFITS.

05:23:20.247 --> 05:23:21.048
THE REASON I SPEAK SO

05:23:21.115 --> 05:23:22.783
PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS IS

05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:26.053
BECAUSEWE HAVE TRIED OVER AND

05:23:26.120 --> 05:23:28.388
OVER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO

05:23:28.455 --> 05:23:29.790
INCENTIVIZE MOVEMENT.

05:23:29.857 --> 05:23:31.625
BY THE COUNTIES WHO WE BARGAIN

05:23:31.692 --> 05:23:33.260
COLLECTIVELY WITH AND SO THIS

05:23:33.327 --> 05:23:34.828
ISN'T TARGETING THE COUNTIES WHO

05:23:34.895 --> 05:23:36.063
HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING THIS

05:23:36.130 --> 05:23:37.464
IS TARGETING THE COUNTIES THAT

05:23:37.531 --> 05:23:40.267
ARE RECALCITRANT AND REFUSE. TO

05:23:40.334 --> 05:23:41.935
DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY THESE WORKERS

05:23:42.002 --> 05:23:43.270
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DON'T

05:23:43.337 --> 05:23:44.838
SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.

05:23:44.905 --> 05:23:47.407
AND I'M GONNA GO BACK TO TWENTY

05:23:47.474 --> 05:23:48.909
TWELVE WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO GET

05:23:48.976 --> 05:23:50.778
THE STATE TO GET THE COMMITTEE

05:23:50.844 --> 05:23:52.646
FIRST CHOICE OPTION WHICH WAS

05:23:52.713 --> 05:23:54.081
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS.

05:23:54.148 --> 05:23:56.150
THAT WAS APPLIED RETROACTIVELY

05:23:56.216 --> 05:23:56.950
WHICH MEANT THAT EVERY COUNTY

05:23:57.017 --> 05:23:59.186
GOT A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT OF

05:23:59.253 --> 05:24:00.854
DOLLARS THAT WAS REFUNDED BACK

05:24:00.921 --> 05:24:02.923
TO THEM WE BAG AT THE TIME FOR

05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:04.258
THOSE DOLLARS TO BE PUT RIGHT

05:24:04.324 --> 05:24:05.459
BACK INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE

05:24:05.526 --> 05:24:07.761
FORM OF WAGES AND BENEFITS AND

05:24:07.828 --> 05:24:09.429
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

05:24:09.496 --> 05:24:10.297
THE I. AGES AS MOE WHICH HAS

05:24:10.364 --> 05:24:12.733
BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN STARTING IN

05:24:12.800 --> 05:24:13.333
TWENTY TWELVE MEANT THAT THE

05:24:13.400 --> 05:24:15.169
COUNTIES WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE

05:24:15.235 --> 05:24:17.204
FOR ANY SPENDING IN THE PROGRAM.

05:24:17.271 --> 05:24:19.273
EXCEPT FOR THREE AND A HALF

05:24:19.339 --> 05:24:20.340
PERCENT GROWTH FACTOR.

05:24:20.407 --> 05:24:22.442
I DIDN'T RESULT IN ANY WAGE

05:24:22.509 --> 05:24:23.911
INCREASES I'M SORRY MR TRACK IS

05:24:23.977 --> 05:24:25.479
BIG ON THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME

05:24:25.546 --> 05:24:26.947
BUT LET ME PASS IT ON TO MY

05:24:27.014 --> 05:24:28.248
COLLEAGUE IN TO SAY THAT WHAT

05:24:28.315 --> 05:24:31.051
WE'RE ASKING.

05:24:31.118 --> 05:24:32.553
FOR IS A COMMITMENT THAT THE

05:24:32.619 --> 05:24:33.020
SAVINGS THAT THEY WILL

05:24:33.086 --> 05:24:33.320
EXPERIENCE.

05:24:33.387 --> 05:24:35.022
WE'LL GO BACK INTO THE POCKET

05:24:35.088 --> 05:24:36.123

THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES WITHOUT A

05:24:50.904 --> 05:24:52.272
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

05:24:52.339 --> 05:24:53.574

THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RECOURSE --

05:24:55.275 --> 05:24:56.877
OUR PROVIDERS CANNOT STRIKE

05:24:56.944 --> 05:24:57.845

PROFESSIONS STATE EMPLOYEES TO

HAVE A CONTRACT.

05:25:08.322 --> 05:25:09.690
THERE WOULD BE CONCERNED IF

HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT

05:25:11.124 --> 05:25:12.926

05:25:17.130 --> 05:25:18.765
IS IS NOT OKAY AND THERE SHOULD

05:25:18.832 --> 05:25:20.300

CALIFORNIA WAGES HAVE INCREASED

06:06:59.464 --> 06:07:00.631

IT'S INCREASED 6% PER YEAR.

06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:07.238

WHEN BIG CORPORATIONS RECEIVE

06:07:09.240 --> 06:07:10.575
BIG PROFITS THAT THAT MONEY

06:07:10.641 --> 06:07:11.776
SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO WORKERS

06:07:11.843 --> 06:07:13.344

06:07:23.054 --> 06:07:24.856

WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT

06:24:35.352 --> 06:24:36.420
WHAT IS.

06:24:36.486 --> 06:24:40.824
EVEY EXPECTING PEOPLE TO DO --

06:24:40.891 --> 06:24:41.992
A HEARING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

06:24:42.058 --> 06:24:43.026
PEOPLE HAVING SIGNIFICANT

06:24:43.093 --> 06:24:44.127
CONCERNS ABOUT CHECKING IN

06:24:44.194 --> 06:24:45.896
CHECKING OUT OTHER TYPES OF

THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO. FOR THEM

06:24:47.431 --> 06:24:49.599
IN ORDER TO BE SURE THAT THEY

06:24:55.372 --> 06:24:58.008
CALIFORNIA HAS DONE.

06:24:58.074 --> 06:25:00.777
FOR THE V. V. THERE IS NO CHECK

06:25:00.844 --> 06:25:03.246
IN OR CHECK OUT REQUIREMENTS

06:25:03.313 --> 06:25:05.182
THIS THE FEDERAL STATUTE

06:25:05.248 --> 06:25:06.983
REQUIRES US TO COLLECT

06:25:07.050 --> 06:25:08.919
INFORMATION OF START TIME IN AND

06:25:08.985 --> 06:25:09.619
TIME.

06:25:09.686 --> 06:25:11.087
SO WHEN THE TIME SHEET IS

06:25:11.154 --> 06:25:12.088
COMPLETED.

06:25:12.155 --> 06:25:13.523
YOU'LL FILL OUT YOUR START TIME

06:25:13.590 --> 06:25:14.858

06:25:14.925 --> 06:25:17.127

OR AT WHATEVER.

06:25:21.097 --> 06:25:24.734
INTERVALS YOU CHOOSE TO FILL OUT --

06:25:24.801 --> 06:25:26.102
THE INFORMATION OR PROVIDE THE

06:25:26.169 --> 06:25:28.004
INFORMATION IS YOU'RE GETTING

06:25:28.071 --> 06:25:29.906
GIVE THOSE ADDITIONAL PIECES OF

06:25:29.973 --> 06:25:31.641
INFORMATION BUT YOU'RE NOT

06:25:31.708 --> 06:25:34.611
STOPPING OR STARTING AS YOU AS

06:25:34.678 --> 06:25:35.812
YOU ACTUALLY DO THE CHECK IN OR

06:25:35.879 --> 06:25:37.247
CHECK OUT --

06:25:37.314 --> 06:25:38.515
FROM THE WORK THAT'S NOT THE

06:25:38.582 --> 06:25:41.318
CASE I'VE ALSO HEARD A COUPLE OF

06:25:41.384 --> 06:25:43.820
CONCERNS AROUND --

06:25:43.887 --> 06:25:48.124
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ABLE --

06:25:48.191 --> 06:25:50.360
TO DO THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY

06:25:50.427 --> 06:25:52.529
SIMILAR TO I WOULD IMAGINE TODAY

06:25:52.596 --> 06:25:54.431
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO SIGN TIME

06:25:54.498 --> 06:25:56.733
SHEETS PERHAPS --

06:25:56.800 --> 06:25:58.468
IF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

06:25:58.535 --> 06:26:00.437
RECIPIENTS ARE IN THOSE TYPES OF

06:26:00.504 --> 06:26:02.806
SITUATIONS THEN IT JUST LIKE

06:26:02.873 --> 06:26:04.007
TODAY.

06:26:04.074 --> 06:26:06.776
A CONSERVATIVE OR A GUARDIAN

06:26:06.843 --> 06:26:08.144
APPARENT.

06:26:08.211 --> 06:26:10.080
AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CAN

06:26:10.146 --> 06:26:12.782
DO THAT ACTIVITY ON THEIR BEHALF

06:26:12.849 --> 06:26:15.552
ELECTRONICALLY THE SAME AS THEY

06:26:15.619 --> 06:26:18.722
WOULD IN PAPER TODAY.

06:26:18.788 --> 06:26:20.257
THE CLEAR FIVE BECAUSE I THINK

06:26:20.323 --> 06:26:21.625
MANY OF THEM ARE FAMILY CARE

06:26:21.691 --> 06:26:23.593
GIVERS WHAT HAPPENS IS THEIR

06:26:23.660 --> 06:26:26.062
GUARDIAN IS ALSO IN THE IHS AS

06:26:26.129 --> 06:26:27.964
CARE GIVERS CAN THEY SIGN OFF ON

06:26:28.031 --> 06:26:29.099
THAT OR NOT I MEAN.

06:26:29.165 --> 06:26:30.734
SO IF THEY HAVE LEGAL

06:26:30.800 --> 06:26:31.568
AUTHORITIES OF THEIR THE

06:26:31.635 --> 06:26:34.004
CONSERVATOR THE PARENT OF A

06:26:34.070 --> 06:26:34.871
MINOR.

06:26:34.938 --> 06:26:37.107
THEN THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

06:26:37.173 --> 06:26:38.642
DO THAT ON THEIR BEHALF EVEN IF

06:26:38.708 --> 06:26:40.143
THEY ARE THE PROVIDER ALSO JUST

06:26:40.210 --> 06:26:41.278
LIKE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

06:26:41.344 --> 06:26:42.579
THAT WITH THE TIME SHE TODAY.

06:26:42.646 --> 06:26:44.481
OKAY SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE

06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:46.249
WERE YOU CAN ADD A CERTAINLY

06:26:46.316 --> 06:26:47.751
UNDERSTANDS SOMEONE SAYS BOOK I

06:26:47.817 --> 06:26:48.919
STILL DON'T LIKE IT I OPPOSE --

06:26:48.985 --> 06:26:51.288
BUT I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE ARE

06:26:51.354 --> 06:26:52.088
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME.

06:26:52.155 --> 06:26:53.490
BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE

06:26:53.557 --> 06:26:54.891
TALKING WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

06:26:54.958 --> 06:26:55.759
ABOUT AND WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING

06:26:55.825 --> 06:26:59.563
AND AND THE PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY

06:26:59.629 --> 06:27:01.598
TO CODIFY.

06:27:01.665 --> 06:27:02.465
THESE PRINCIPLES SO THAT WE

06:27:02.532 --> 06:27:03.633
DON'T GO TO X. I KNOW THERE WAS

06:27:03.700 --> 06:27:05.702
A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL THE I THINK

06:27:05.769 --> 06:27:07.103
IT WAS A YEAR A YEAR AGO OR SO

06:27:07.170 --> 06:27:08.238
THAT BORDER WAS IN THE CHECK IN

06:27:08.305 --> 06:27:10.340
CHECK OUT WHICH WE REJECTED.

06:27:10.407 --> 06:27:11.474
AND SO THAT'S NOT THE DIRECTION

06:27:11.541 --> 06:27:12.609
WE'RE GOING IN IN THE STATE OF

06:27:12.676 --> 06:27:13.777
CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANNA BE

06:27:13.843 --> 06:27:15.211
SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

06:27:15.278 --> 06:27:18.415
