00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.785
AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL-

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:27.619
AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT ALSO

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.322
INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.457
OTHER ADVOCATES AND FAMILY

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:34.626
MEMBERS- AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:36.095
DISCUSSION SHOULD REALLY BE TO

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.963
IDENTIFY THE GAPS NEEDS AND

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.532
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PROBATE

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:43.902
CONSERVATORSHIP AND- WHAT THIS

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.437
POSITION WOULD DO IS REALLY TO

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:47.239
TAKE A STATE WIDE VIEW OF THE

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:50.743
LOCAL OFFICES- FOUNDATIONAL TO

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.412
DOING THIS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.581
IS REALLY GOOD DATA. SO IN OUR

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:57.950
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PAP'S GPC

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:01.954
ASSOCIATION. WHAT WE'VE-DISCOVERED IS THERE'S A LACK OF-

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.590
STATEWIDE RELIABLE DATA AND-

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.325
WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.960
PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP OF

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.195
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STATEWIDE- AS

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:11.864

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.002
INDIVIDUALS- AND SURVIVE. AS A

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.504
CONSERVATORSHIP. SO WHAT THIS ON

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.106
DO IS REALLY- HOW. FACILITATE

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:22.808
THE ACT COLLECTION OF THAT DATA

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.277
AND TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.279
THE TYPE OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.481
BE COLLECTED- ONCE WE HAVE THIS

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.549
DATA COLLECTED THEN WE THINK

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.050
THAT WE CAN HAVE REALLY GET

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.153
MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS- ABOUT

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.120
THE CASTING IT'S AN

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:36.822
OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PROGRAM.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.790
AND REALLY START BUILDING

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.858
TOWARDS A MORE CONSISTENT

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:43.095
EQUITABLE- CONSERVATORSHIP

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.164
PROGRAMS STATEWIDE- ARE THERE

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.001
ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SO

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:52.004
YOU'RE YOU'RE A- THE ROLE THEN

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.338
WILL BE FOR THIS PERSON TO

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.240
COORDINATE WITH ALL THE LOCAL

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:57.276
COUNTY PUBLIC GUARDIAN OFFICES

00:17:57.342 --> 00:18:00.078
AND SO RIGHT AND THIS LAYS ON

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.147
THEN WILL BE. DEVELOPING THE

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:04.283
DELETED DATA COLLECTION TOOL FOR

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.251
THE DATA COLLECTION TOOLS

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.587
ALREADY IN PLACE DO WE KNOW.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:09.721
WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT THERE IS I

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:13.091
KNOW THAT- LOCAL PPG PC OFFICERS

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:16.929
ATTEMPT TO COLLECT. DATA ON- THE

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.197
CONSERVATORSHIP SOMETHING

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.032
ESTABLISHING WHO THEY SERVE- WE

00:18:20.098 --> 00:18:21.533
THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.268
ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE AS

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:24.736
THEY KEEP ALL OF THESE CONSERVE

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:26.805
SHIPS ON FILE. SO WE REALLY SEE

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:27.906
IT AS BEING A COLLABORATIVE

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.775
PROCESS AND WORKING WITH THE

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:31.777
STAKEHOLDERS TO. DETERMINE THE

DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:35.514
AND THEN DETERMINING WHO'S THE

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.416
BEST NGH YOU CENTRALLY COLLECT

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:39.051
THIS DATA WHETHER IT'S CA OR

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:41.220
ANOTHER AND SHE- BUT DEFINITELY

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.055
THIS LAYS ON WOULD BRING. ALL

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:45.324
THE DATA TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.824
PRESENT IN THE FORM O

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:48.126
DASHBOARD- THAT WOULD BE EASILY

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:49.361
TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESSIBLE AND

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:53.699
DO DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA AT THIS

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:54.900
POINT. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING A

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.802

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:27.399

I'LL START OFF AN EXAM OF THE ME

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.297
PROGRAM WHICH WAS EXTRAORDINARY

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.198

EXPERIENCE VERY LOW- FOOD

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:11.576
INSECURITY- AND THEN RECENTLY IN

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:14.312
THE FALL A CONSULTANT- DINA

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:16.882

DURING THE PANDEMIC THROUGH ALL

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:38.403
THE NUMEROUS- AUGMENTATIONS THAT

HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.852
MEALS TWO TO THREE HUNDRED

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.120
SEVENTY MILLION MALES WE'RE

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:57.188
STILL ANALYZING THAT REPORT- AND

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:58.857
MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO

DISCUSS IT AND- WE'RE GOING TO

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.795
CONTINUE TO TRACK- REFINERY OR

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:07.465
ESTIMATES. OF THE GAP- IN

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.066
CALIFORNIA BUT WE DEFINITELY

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:09.501
THINK THAT THE ADDITIONAL

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.369
INVESTMENTS RECEIVED DURING HAVE

00:26:11.436 --> 00:26:13.371

NUTRITION. DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.415
AND THEN INTO OF- CHALLENGE ARE

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:25.550
FACED BY- OUR PROVIDER DURING

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:27.852
THE CARE IT AND I CAN. I AM THE

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.154
OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC-

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.323
DEFINITELY. SENATE JOHN RAMPS UP

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:32.357
- THERE IS A INFLUX OF MONEY

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.526
THERE'S A LOT AT ASTON- BUT

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:37.796
BECAUSE NEWS IS FIVE AWAITS OF

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:38.930
TWENTY TWENTY EARLY FALL- WE'VE

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:41.132
SEEN A RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.001
GROWTH IN THEIR CAPACITY TO

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:46.604
SERVE- OLDER ADULTS- SO THEY

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.440
REALLY IN A STEP FORWARD AND

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.675
WERE ABLE TO RAMP UP QUICKLY-

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.544
MORE RECENTLY- A CHALLENGE THAT

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.046
WE'RE SEEING IS- THE RESUMPTION

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.115
AND OF. IN PERSON OR CONGREGATE

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:59.484
MEAL SITES. SO THE STATE HAD PUT

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.152
TOGETHER A PROGRAM MEMO LAST

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:04.522
SUMMER. AND IN THE- LOCAL AREA

PRACTICES RESOURCE AND TOOL KIT.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.265
TO A SYSTEM BE- REOPENING SAFE

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:16.234
OPENING OF CONGREGATE SITES-

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.036
THAT WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:19.571
ONSET OF DELTA AND THE OMICRON

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:23.508
VIRUS- BUT WE'RE HOPING AS- THE-

00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:26.678
VIRUS SUBSIDES AND AS- HAS KIDS

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.546
AND YOU KNOW. HE GOT MORE

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.648
AVAILABLE AND CONGREGATE SITES

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.018
ARE ABLE TO RESTRUCTURE TO

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:35.987
PROVIDE SAFE MAIL DELIVERY. THAT

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:37.455
PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO REVIEW

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:44.262
RESUME CONGREGATE ON SERVICES-

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:49.467
THIS YEAR. IN THEN I WILL ON TO.

00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:50.301
AND THE LAST QUESTION WHICH

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:51.569
DEALS WITH OUR EIGHT R. C.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.438
CERVICAL IS A WHAT WOULD TAKE

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.373
EXPAND- BAT R. C. SYSTEMS SAY.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.474
AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.043
MULTIPLE STEPS INVOLVED IN MASS

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.244
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.812
ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.081
BETWEEN OUR LOCAL AREA AGENCIES

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.383
ON AGING AND- INDEPENDENT LIVING

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.485
CENTERS I IN ALL COUNTIES

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.888
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THERE ARE

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.923
EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND WERE

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.160
VERY PROUD TO REPORT. THAT WE

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.796
HAVE- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.330
WELL WE ALL CALL DESIGNATED OR

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:22.667
ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FROM SIX TO

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.502
FIFTEEN AND WE HAVE INCREASED

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:27.705
THE NUMBER OF EMERGING PROGRAMS-

00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:29.407
IN THE STATE AS WELL SO

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.276
CURRENTLY THIRTY COUNTIES HAVE

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:32.811
EITHER AN ESTABLISHED OR

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.146
DEVELOPING A OR C. THAT COVERS

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.382
51% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION.

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.350
SO WE ARE SEEING POSITIVE GROWTH

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.286
AND DEVELOPMENT- SO WHAT THE

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:42.821
STATE'S FOCUS SAYS IN

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.222
COLLABORATION WITH OUR PARTNERS

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.767
WHAT THAT MEANS SURLY THINKING

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:03.401
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT HALF OF

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:06.070
OUR INITIALS ARE THAT'S TRUE

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.071
THAT'S TRUE. THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:09.307
THINK OF A MORE- MAYBE

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.876
DESCRIPTIVE- AT. BETTER

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:13.077
DESCRIPTOR FOR THE PROGRAM

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:15.213
SEARCHES ONE DOOR. BECAUSE

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.247
REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.016

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.460
BRANDING IS GOING TO BE A BIT

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.562

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.932
THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL BE.

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:35.366

SERVICES- A SECOND PART OF THAT

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:42.240
IS REALLY ACCESS TO SERVICES. SO

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.641
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.043
BUILDING MAYBE A CUSTOMER PORTAL

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:47.579

AS CREATING MORE CONSISTENT.

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:58.289
ASKING WHY TELEPHONE STRUCTURE

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.125
OF. FOLKS WHO ARE CONNECTED. TO

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.327

THERE'S ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:15.506
THAT GOES BEHIND- SETTING UP IT

00:31:15.573 --> 00:31:17.442

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.888
CREATES A PERMANENT SOLUTION

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:02.858
THAT ALLOWS- COUNTIES TO- HELP.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.594
I JUST AS RECIPIENTS FROM THE

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.997
BACK OF PROVIDERS- ADDITIONALLY

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.166
IT- WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:11.701
THERE'S ALSO AN INCLUSION OF

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.402
NINE AND NINETEEN POINT ONE

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.871
MILLION. DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.606
THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:20.943
REQUIREMENT. I'M WHICH COST

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.946
MEDIC HOW- TERMINATIONS ARE RE

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.881
DETERMINATIONS IN RESPONSE TO

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.783
THE PUBLIC NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.618
PREVENTS CASES FROM SHIFTING

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:35.191
FROM- FROM UP. SORRY FROM

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:36.926
SHIFTING FROM THE NON FEDERAL

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.594
INTO A NON FEDERALLY FUNDED

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.097
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CENTRAL.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.231
ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:46.469
INCLUDES- A PENALTY REDUCTION

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.471
FOR THE LET RECIPROCATION

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:50.873
IMPLEMENTATION- IT COVERS THE

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.208
FIRST SIX MONTHS OF PENALTIES

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:55.811
AND- TWICE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.180
THREE. AND- CHAU AND THEN

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.916
LOOKING AT THE AGENDA IT LOOKS

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.952
LIKE YOU THEY DID A WONDERFUL

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.019
JOB OF OUTLINING ALL OF THE

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:06.455
INVESTMENTS WERE THERE ANY

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.524
QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THIS.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.725
WELL WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.494
THE L. A. O. IN A MINUTE BUT I

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.429
GUESS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:15.197
THINGS IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK A

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.132
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. IS TO

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.900
WHAT YOU CONTRIBUTE THE- THE

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:22.571
DECLINE IN IN CASES. SURE SO

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:25.574
THAT WAS- THE SECOND QUESTION I

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.476
BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS- ISSUE

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.779
RAISED WITH REGARD OR CONCERN

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.947
WITH REGARDS TO THERE'S A SLOWER

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.450
SLOWER GROWTH IN THE PEACHTREE'S

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.252
. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.788
TRIBUTE- AS IT WAS KIND OF

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.257
ALLUDED TO BUYER- OUR COLLEAGUES

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.826
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING THAT

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:46.362
THEY'RE DUE TO THE COVERT

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:47.096
NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE WERE

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:49.999
LOTS OF- INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:52.501
WHO DIDNOT WANT TO HAVE

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:56.605
STRANGERS IN THEIR HOMES SO- WE

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.707
THINK. BASED ON. ANECDOTAL DATA

01:07:58.774 --> 01:07:59.875
THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:02.344
STATE MEETINGS WE BELIEVE THIS

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:05.214
AND- ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:08.617
- THERE WAS GROWTH THE PAGE. AND

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.619
PAID CASE. BUT WE DO TO LOOK AT

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:14.523
THE PRO DATA TO A- TRÊN- AT TO

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.091
SEE IF CAN FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:19.829
ANY OTHER- THINGS HAPPEN OUT

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.598
THERE THAT. THAT- IMPACTS THE

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.700
NUMBER OF CASES HAVE THE AMOUNT

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:28.437
OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS GONE UP.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.638
AND WHEN WE SAY PETER TALKING

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:33.309
OUTSIDE. PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:37.012
FROM- AN AGENCY. SO ALL OF OUR

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:39.014
PROVIDERS ARE FOR THE MOST PART

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:42.051
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ARE-

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.919
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS STERN WE

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.754
HAVE A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:49.258
CASES ACTUALLY HAVE. AN AGENCY-

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.860
EMPLOYEE COME TO THEIR HOME LESS

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.828
THAN A HUNDRED CASES SO MOST OF

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:57.666
OUR PROVIDERS ARE- ARE JUST

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:58.667
PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.903
COMMUNITY. 74% AND THAT SEEMS TO

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.972
BE STAYING PRETTY RELATIVELY

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:05.541
FLAT THAT NUMBER 74% OF THOSE

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:09.011
INDIVIDUALS HAVE A PROVIDER WHO-

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.014
WHO IS RELATED TO THEM NOT- SO

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.551
THE- AND IN SOME CASES. THERE

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.987
COULD BE MULTIPLE PROVIDERS ON

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:23.592
THE CASE SO SHORT SO. AND WE

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:26.462
HAVE SEEN OVER THAT- OVER THE

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.164
YEARS THAT WE DO SEE AN INCREASE

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.967
WITH OF PROVIDERS WHO ARE

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:33.369
RELATIVE PROVIDERS BUT IT'S NOT

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:39.708
AS- IT'S NOT AS PREVALENT. AS AS

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:42.311
ACROSS THE POPULATION. THAT

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.479
MAKES SENSE BUT WE'VE HAD THAT

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.247
SAID WHAT I'M READING AS WE HAVE

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.250
HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF REFERRALS

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:51.654
AND DECLINES BUT BUT THE NUMBERS

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.956
GOING DOWN ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.658
WERE BRINGING INTO THE PROGRAM.

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.159
I'VE BEEN ANY ANYTHING THAT'S

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.327
JUST THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.395
SOMEBODY ELSE IN THEIR HOME BUT

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.496
AT THIS POINT THAT'S JUST

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.264
ANECDOTAL IS THAT CORRECT.

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.500
THAT'S CORRECT SO WHAT WE ARE

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.168
SEEING IS THAT THAT YOU'RE RIGHT

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.137
THE NUMBER OF CASES COMING AND

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.539
HAS HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE.

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.241
BUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.577
CASES WHO ARE PAID MEANING THAT

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:17.479
A PROVIDER HAS HOME IS CONNECTED

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.315
TO THAT RECIPIENT IN TIME SHEET

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.217
ACTIVITY- AND THERE'S TRANSIT

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.319
ACTIVITY WE'RE SEEING THAT. THAT

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.255
NUMBER. OF CASES HAS ACTUALLY

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.591
INCREASED OVER THAT PANDEMIC SO

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:30.225
IT'S NOT THE OVERALL SHE SLOWED

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:31.894
IS THE FOLKS THAT. HAVE A

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:34.763
PROVIDER- WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:37.700
AT THE DATA IT SEEMS AS THOUGH.

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:40.135
JUST THIS IS A- DURING CULTURE

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:42.638
NINETEENTH SO PRIOR TO COPE IT

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.139
NEEDED WE DID NOT SEE THAT. AS A

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:49.979
WERE TRADING THAT. TO TWO

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.313
RECIPIENTSREALLY BE CARE IN CAR

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.383
ABOUT THEY HAVE. AND NOT

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:55.517
BRINGING NEW PEOPLE IT SO YOU

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:58.420
HAVE A FLAT RATE. OF YOU HAVE A

01:10:58.487 --> 01:10:59.888
NUMBER OF GROUP OF RECIPIENTS

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.490
WHO WHO DO HAVE A RELATIVE

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.158
PROVIDER BUT YOU DO HAVE A

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.294
ANOTHER SUBSET OF RECIPIENTS WHO

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.363
DO NOT HAVE A ROLE TO PROVIDER.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:08.797
AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AS THEY

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.599
COME INTO THE PROGRAM MAY NOT

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.801
HAVE. A FAMILY MEMBER OR

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.169
SOMEBODY WHO LIVES WITH THEM

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:16.071
THAT CAN PROVIDE THEIR CARE AND

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.906
THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY DURING

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:20.976
THIS TIME NOT WANT TO HAVE A

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:24.179
STRANGER COME INTO THEIR HOME

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.114
AND PROVIDE THAT'S- BUT- THE

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.348
CURRENTLY THEN WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.583
KNOW THE STATUS OF THOSE PEOPLE.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.351
IF THEY'RE JUST OUT THERE THE

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.552
MORNING CARE WITHOUT BEING ABLE

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:31.754
TO HAVE ANY IN. WE JUST KNOW

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.756
THEY WERE PICKED UP ON AND OUR

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.724
CASELOADS. SO WE KNOW THAT

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.593
THEY'RE NOT PAID BUT WE DO HAVE

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.030
MECHANISMS THAT- THAT. COUNTIES

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.331
CAN USE TO IDENTIFY WE HAVE

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:45.000
REPORTING BACK TO COUNTIES USED

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:46.468
TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.103
HAVE A PAYROLL ACTIVELY FOR

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.738
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. AND

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.106
THAT'S NOT JUST FOR NEW BUT

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.341
THAT'S FOR EXISTING PEOPLE SO

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.842
THE COUNTIES DO OUTREACH TO

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.544
THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEE IF THEY

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.746
CAN HELP THEM. WITH A SIGNING UP

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.214
PROVIDER OR IF YOU NEED SOME

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.516
TYPE OF THIS STEP SO WEAK THERE

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.750
ARE MECHANISMS WITHIN THE

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.653
PROGRAM. FOR COUNTIES TO DO THAT

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.457
OUTREACH. OKAY THANK YOU.

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:12.127
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH I

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.462
KNOW I'M CONFIRMING OF FINANCE

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.730
NOTHING FURTHER TO ADEQUATELY

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:17.199
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:20.869
VERY MUCH LMAO. IT'S JACQUI YOU

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:23.372
KNOW AND WE RECENTLY OUR INITIAL

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.441
ANALYSIS OF THE HSS PROJECT

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:28.377
INCLUDED IN THAT ANALYSIS- WAS

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:30.279
KEY OBSERVATIONS AROUND CASELOAD

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:34.450
AND AS WAS NOTED IN THE AGENDA-

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.785
WE DIDN'T WE ARE SEEING THAT- AS

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.921
AUTHORIZED CASES AND PAID CASES

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:42.624
ARE INCREASING. THERE IS STILL.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.426
A GREATER DIFFERENCE BETEEN

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:46.862
THOSE TWO NUMBERS OPERATES CASES

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:49.498
AND THEN AMONG THE- PAID CASES

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.966
SO PAID CASES HAVE JUST BEEN

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.468
INCREASING AT A SLOWER RATE

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.169
RELATIVE TO PRE COMBAT NINETEEN

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.739
LEVELS- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.307
DEPARTMENT TO GET ADDITIONAL

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:01.110
INFORMATION TO SEE- TRY TO

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.444
ISOLATE LIKE WHERE IS IT

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.613
HAPPENING- BECAUSE AS- THE CHAIR

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.648
MENTIONED. WE'RE STILL SEEING

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:07.950
THE SAME NUMBER RECIPIENTS

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.618
COMING IN EVERY MONTH THE NEWLY

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.120
AUTHORIZED CASES COMING IN EVERY

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.387
MONTH THE RECEIPTS SEEING THE

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.456
SAME NUMBER OF DENIALS EVERY

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.725
MONTH- RELATIVE TO PRE COALPIT

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.460
NINETEEN LEVELS AMID AND IN

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.262
ADDITION WE'RE HOPEFULLY WITH

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:22.564
THE DATA AND WE CAN GET A BETTER

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.799
SENSE OF IF THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:25.534
RECIPIENT TYPES ARE CASE TYPES.

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.636
WHERE THIS PARTICULAR TEN JUST

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.705
CONCENTRATED SUCH AS LIBYAN

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.874
VERSUS NON LIVE IN PROVIDERS I

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.509
MEAN MAYBE THAT WILL GIVE US A

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.043
BETTER SENSE STEP TO WHAT EXTENT

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.912
IS THIS SAD TREND DUE TO

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:40.048
PERSONAL CHOICE- VERSES. UNMET

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.251
NEED INDIVIDUALS PERHAPS I'M

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.986
HAVING A HARDER TIME TO FIND A

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.420
PROVIDER AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.756
KEY OBSERVATION- THAT WE MADE IN

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.158
OUR ANALYSIS THAT WAS ALSO

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:52.361
REFERENCED IN THE- IT AND THE

CLOSELY OVER SINCE THE BEGINNING

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.478

UP AGAIN WE SEE THE CASE WITH

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:47.988
THE BACK UP AND THE REASON THAT

01:48:48.054 --> 01:48:49.756
WE BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. IS

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.625
BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE

01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:53.660
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE REACHED ATS

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:55.695
IT'S REAL- INTERACTION WITH

MANDATED REPORTERS. AND WE KNOW

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.033
THAT THIS POPULATION WAS NOT

SERVICES. WHERE ABUSE CAN BE

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:12.846
IDENTIFIED AS QUICKLY. SO WE ARE

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:23.556

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.484
THAT THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.119
THAT LACK OF INTERACTION WITH

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:56.823
