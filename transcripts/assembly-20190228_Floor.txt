THIS LAW HELPS REDUCE THE TRAGEDY IS GUN VIOLENCE BY KEEPING FIRE ARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. HOWEVER UNTIL WE BRING THIS EFFECTIVE FIREARM POLICY TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY A DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE IN FEDERAL GUN LAWS STILL EXEMPTS UNLICENSED SELLERS FROM HAVING TO REFORM ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS WHAT SO. BEFORE SELLING A FIREARM. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT GUNS ARE NOT SOLD TO PROHIBITED PEOPLE IS THROUGH A NATIONAL UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AT THE POINT OF TRANSFER OF ANY FIREARM.

ARE READ TO YOU THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL TO CONTROL HE IN GUNS. WHICH THEN CHANGED TO HANDGUN CONTROL INC WHICH IS NOW THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. HIS WORDS WERE I AM CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO BUILD ON WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME. AND THE FIRST STEP IS NECESSARILY GIVEN THE POLITICAL REALITIES GOING TO BE VERY MODEST RIGHT NOW THOUGH WE BE SATISFIED WITH HOW BELOW WITH NOT HALF A LOAF BUT A SLICE. ARE ULTIMATE GOAL TOTAL CONTROL OF HANDGUNS IN THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. THAT'S THE GOAL [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] SECOND.

IS ONE FORSMAN GONNA GO KNOCK ON EVERYONE'S STORE I DON'T I DON'T EVEN SEE HOW THIS IS ENFORCEABLE. THIRD THIS BILL DOESN'T COVERS STOCKING. WHICH SHOULD FRIGHTEN EVERY WOMAN IN HERE. ANY MAN IN HERE IS A SISTER A MOTHER OR DAUGHTER DOESN'T COVER STOCKING. THE BILL SAYS THAT IT'S IT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THEY ARE IN IN IN NEAR OR IMMINENT DANGER BUT ONLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT. THEY ARE ACTUALLY IN NEAR -- IMMINENT DANGER WHAT WHO IS THE JUDGE OF THAT. WHEN I WAS ABOUT? TWO YEARS OLD MAYBE YOUNGER THAN. TO MY PARENTS WERE GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE. MY FATHER WAS VERY ABUSIVE TO MY MOTHER OKAY [inaudible] HE WHEN THEY WERE LIVING IN A SEPARATE HOUSEHOLD -- IN HE WENT HE'S WAITING FOR HER AT HER CAR ACTUALLY IN THE MORNING. BEFORE SHE WAS GOING TO WORK. AND TOLD HER. THAT HE WAS COMING AFTER HER HE WAS GONNA KILLER. THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO WITNESS IT. NO PROOF RIGHT. SO SHE GOES TO WORK. SHE KNOWS HE'S VIOLENCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE'S HE'S ALREADY BEEN. VIOLENT WITH THEIR IN THE PAST TO SHE DECIDES TO GET HER CHILDREN AFTER WORK AND GO TO OUR IN LAWS HOUSE BECAUSE SHE THINKS INNER HAD SURELY HE'S NOT GOING TO HARM ME IN FRONT OF HIS OWN PARENTS. THERE SHE GOES OUR IN LAWS HOUSE AND SHE PARKS HER CAR IN THEIR GARAGE TO HE CAN'T SEE IT SO WE CAN GO BY THERE. AND AND FIND HER. AND THAT EVENING HE FOUND HER HE CAME TO THAT HELL NO MY IN LAWS ARE HER IN LAWS EXCUSE ME WEREN'T HOME AT THE TIME WHICH HE PROBABLY KNEW. SO HE GOES TO THE HOME. AND HE GOES IN THERE AND START HITTING HER AND STARTS SCREAMING AT HER AND STARTS THREATENING HER. ANY BACKS ARE AGAINST THE WALL. ANY PUTS HIS HAND ON HER THROAT. AND STARTS CHOKING HER. HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO GO TO THAT HOUSE. WHEN HE KNEW HIS PARENTS WERE GOING TO BE THERE? WHEN HE WASN'T SMART ENOUGH TO DO IS TO REALIZE THAT MY MOTHER HAD ASKED A FRIEND AT WORK THE ONLY PERSON SHE KNEW? WHO OWNED A FIREARM IF SHE COULD BORROW THEIR WEAPONS? AND SHE DID AND THAT WALL THAT HE HAD HER AGAINST RIGHT NEXT TO THE TV IN THE TV STAND SHE PUT THAT GUY RIGHT THERE BEHIND THAT TELEVISION WHEN HE HAD HER AGAINST THE WALL. AND SHE ALMOST PASSED OUT SHE REACHED BACK THERE AND GRAB THAT GUN. SHE DIDN'T SHOOT HIM. BUT IT WAS ENOUGH. TO MAKE HIM LEAVE TO MAKE HIM RUN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT POWER DO. BUT IT SAVED HER LIFE. I AGREE WITH YOU. WE WANT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT. AND WE HAVE WAYS TO DO THAT AND WE CAN WORK ON OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
