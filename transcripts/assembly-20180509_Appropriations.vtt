THANK YOU MISTER KALRA.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:48.325 region:rollup2

CAN READ THE BILL I'M KIND OF

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:51.028 region:rollup2
CURIOUS.

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.696 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN TO US HOW AND WHAT

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.864 region:rollup2
PRODUCT WILL BE USED.

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:55.833 region:rollup2
IN A BENEFICIAL WAY AND WHAT

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:56.801 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPE OF USE.

00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:58.769 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE RIGHT

00:48:56.801 --> 00:49:02.640 region:rollup2
NOW BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:04.241 region:rollup2
THE THE THE USE OF CANNABIS ON

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.811 region:rollup2
ON ANIMALS REALLY.

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:08.646 region:rollup2
BUT LIMIT CERTAIN FOLKS ON CBD

00:49:06.811 --> 00:49:10.281 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE MEDICINAL COMPONENT

00:49:08.646 --> 00:49:11.949 region:rollup2
OF CANNABIS NOT TEENAGE SEE.

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:13.250 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE COMPONENT THAT

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
CREATES THE HIGH.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.520 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS EXTENSIVE

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.022 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE WILL

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.789 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE DONE.

00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:20.958 region:rollup2
IN WORKING WITH THIS BILL WE

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:22.126 region:rollup2
ARE. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:24.361 region:rollup2
CONTACT WITH IN FACT.

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:25.129 region:rollup2
OF WILL CONTINUE TO BE CASA

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:27.198 region:rollup2
CONTACT WITH RESEARCHERS AND

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:28.466 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES.

00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:29.900 region:rollup2
.

00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:31.368 region:rollup2
THAT PART OF THE BILL IS TO

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.670 region:rollup2
PERSONAL ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:35.039 region:rollup2
LEAST DISCUSS WHAT THEIR PATIENT

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:36.874 region:rollup2
OWNERS CANNABIS AYE IT'S UP THE

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:39.844 region:rollup2
VETERINARIAN TO WANT TO DO THAT.

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:41.645 region:rollup2
EYES SO. THERE'S NO.

00:49:39.844 --> 00:49:43.948 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MUST

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:44.849 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION IT IT COULD DIED

00:49:43.948 --> 00:49:46.617 region:rollup2
OF THE BOARD TO CREATE

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:48.652 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND SAW THAT WOULD

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:50.054 region:rollup2
ALLOW GOING FORWARD. TO USE THE

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:52.890 region:rollup2
SCIENCE THE RESEARCH AS IT IS

00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:54.658 region:rollup2
ONGOING RESEARCH TO ENSURE THAT

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:56.126 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMEONE GOES IN DISPENSED

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
ME THERE'S ACTUALLY GUIDANCE FOR

00:49:56.126 --> 00:50:00.397 region:rollup2
THE DISPENSARY.

00:49:57.328 --> 00:50:01.165 region:rollup2
AS TO. WHAT TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:03.601 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ADMITTED TO?

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:04.835 region:rollup2
THE PAINT TO PET OWNERS AND SO

00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:07.204 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THIS IS SOMETHING

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:09.440 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON WHY THIS BILL I

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:12.076 region:rollup2
WAS PUT FORWARD. WISE IN ORDER

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.477 region:rollup2
TO CREATE SOME KIND OF BASIS.

00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:15.446 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO NOT HAVING ANY

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:16.814 region:rollup2
RULES AT ALL. AYE AND CERTAINLY

00:50:15.446 --> 00:50:19.083 region:rollup2
TO REMOVE LIABILITY FOR

00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:21.285 region:rollup2
VETERINARIANS WHO HAVE NO

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.920 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO EVEN DISCUSS CANNABIS

00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:24.688 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR PATIENT OWNERS SOBER

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.490 region:rollup2
MOOD LIABILITY WORK TOWARDS

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.725 region:rollup2
CREATING THE GUIDELINES AND

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.159 region:rollup2
ALLOW DISPENSARIES TO DISPENSE

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:30.294 region:rollup2
AT AND I THINK THAT THOSE THAT

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:32.029 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF THOSE THREE

00:50:30.294 --> 00:50:34.164 region:rollup2
THINGS. BROADBAND CHILE JUST AS

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:36.534 region:rollup2
THE BELT THAT THE BUREAU RIGHT

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:37.434 region:rollup2
NOW IS PUTTING TOGETHER THESE

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:37.601 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES THIS.

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.669 region:rollup2
OF.

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.236 region:rollup2
THIS GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:40.738 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL ALLOW THE

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:42.873 region:rollup2
BUREAU TO IN ADDITION.

00:50:40.738 --> 00:50:45.309 region:rollup2
THAT IN ADDITION TO THE WORK

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:46.410 region:rollup2
IT'S DOING IN TERMS OF HUMAN USE

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:47.845 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM TO ALSO WORK WITH THE

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:50.648 region:rollup2
VETERINARY BOARD THAT OF

00:50:47.845 --> 00:50:52.383 region:rollup2
VETERINARY MEDICINE UP OF. TO

00:50:50.648 --> 00:50:54.385 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT IF THE SUSPENSE

00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:56.120 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLY BECAUSE OF COURSE IT

00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:57.855 region:rollup2
CAN ONLY BE DISPENSED FOR

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.657 region:rollup2
MEDICAL AILMENTS O. FOR PATIENT

00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:00.858 region:rollup2
HONORS IN THE REASON WHY. IT WAS

00:50:59.657 --> 00:51:03.827 region:rollup2
MOVED FROM THE MEDICINAL TO THE

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:04.962 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL IS THAT A PET CAN

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:07.097 region:rollup2
GET A MEDICAL CANNABIS CARD.

00:51:04.962 --> 00:51:08.699 region:rollup2
AND SO IS THE CREDIT THAT THIS

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:10.467 region:rollup2
WAS TO THE SUGGESTION OF THE BMP

00:51:08.699 --> 00:51:11.835 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE PUBLIC CHAIR LOW AND

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:13.404 region:rollup2
AND TE STAFF DOING A TREMENDOUS

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:15.239 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF WORK. THAT IT WAS

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:16.473 region:rollup2
MOVED TO THE RECREATIONAL AT

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.442 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ABOUT PETS GETTING

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:19.243 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL USE OF CANNABIS AT

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.711 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:22.079 region:rollup2
RIGHT UNDERSTANDING THAT FROM

00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:23.581 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE BUT

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.281 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY SEVERAL WAYS THAT

00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:26.951 region:rollup2
AN ANIMAL CAN.

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:28.452 region:rollup2
.

00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:29.820 region:rollup2
THE AFFECTED BY THIS ONE IS

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:31.188 region:rollup2
EITHER THROUGH A SUBCUTANEOUS

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.357 region:rollup2
INJECTION TO FROM AN

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:35.726 region:rollup2
INTRAMUSCULAR THREE FROM OUR A

00:51:33.357 --> 00:51:37.161 region:rollup2
NASAL MIST OR ORAL A

00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:38.963 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THOSE ARE THE

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:40.965 region:rollup2
ONLY METHODS. OF THAT YOU CAN

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:43.734 region:rollup2
REALLY IF I GET THIS PRODUCT AND

00:51:40.965 --> 00:51:45.169 region:rollup2
SITE THOSE ALL REQUIRED FTA

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:46.770 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF APPROVAL WITH

00:51:45.169 --> 00:51:48.272 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION THAT THE PRODUCT

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.374 region:rollup2
IS HEALTHY AND SAFE. FOR THE.

00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:52.109 region:rollup2
AND ANIMAL THAT'S BEING.

00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:53.611 region:rollup2
USE FOR THIS UNLESS WE'RE GOING

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.479 region:rollup2
TO USE SOME KIND OF FORM OF LIKE

00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:57.348 region:rollup2
A SCOOBY SNACK YOU KNOW WE PUT

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:58.148 region:rollup2
IT INSIDE. STUFF TO MAKE FUN OF

00:51:57.348 --> 00:51:59.717 region:rollup2
IT IS JUST THEN TOOK BECAUSE

00:51:58.148 --> 00:52:01.485 region:rollup2
SAVE THE WAY IT IS YOU WOULD PUT

00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:03.120 region:rollup2
IT IN SOMETHING. THAT WOULD BE A

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:05.422 region:rollup2
TREAT FOR THE ANIMAL WHETHER IT

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.324 region:rollup2
BE DOG CAT WHATEVER TO TO TO

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:08.058 region:rollup2
INGEST THERE ALSO AND JUST KIND

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:10.027 region:rollup2
OF CURIOUS HOW WE'RE GONNA

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:11.762 region:rollup2
HAMLET. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH

00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:12.763 region:rollup2
THE FDA WELL FIRST LAWS

00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:16.500 region:rollup2
WONDERING HOW LONG THIS BILL

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:17.067 region:rollup2
WOULD BE EXISTS FOR SOMEONE

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.301 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REFERRED TO SCOOBY

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
SNACKS.

00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:19.737 region:rollup2
BUT I'D THAT THE REALITY IS THAT

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.571 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A THAT YOU'RE CORRECT

00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:22.039 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT

00:52:20.571 --> 00:52:23.307 region:rollup2
YOU COULD CERTAINLY GET AN

00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2
ANIMAL TO INJUSTICE BUT THERE

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:28.078 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE. LOTIONS AND AND AND

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:30.314 region:rollup2
POTIONS LOTIONS AND SUCH FOR

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:33.250 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL USE FOR MUSCLE ACHES

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:33.917 region:rollup2
WHAT HAVE YOU. ADAPTING SAID THE

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.019 region:rollup2
FDA OF COURSE HASN'T.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:36.787 region:rollup2
APPROVED OF CANNABIS FOR HUMAN

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:39.289 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION.

00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:40.190 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT OF. THE

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.359 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.894 region:rollup2
BASED UPON NOT JUST WHAT THE

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:45.129 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS PUT FORWARD BUT

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:46.997 region:rollup2
BASED UPON THE VOTE OF THE

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:49.466 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ON NUMEROUS

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:50.501 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS. HAS. ALLOWED HIM FOR

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.236 region:rollup2
AT LEAST A STATE REPORT

00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:53.570 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THIS TENSION

00:52:52.236 --> 00:52:55.139 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTS EVEN FOR HUMAN

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.907 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:58.542 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. AND SO.

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:59.543 region:rollup2
THIS IN NO WAY AND THAT'S WHY

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:01.745 region:rollup2
MAKE IT COULD THIS IN NO WAY

YOU KNOW THERE'S A.

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:32.709 region:rollup2
A FEDERAL LAW.

00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:33.510 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES A WITHDRAWAL

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.978 region:rollup2
PERIOD FOR ALL PRESCRIBED

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.413 region:rollup2
MEDICINES

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:38.682 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE SELLING LIVESTOCK

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:39.583 region:rollup2
AND YOU'VE TREATED IT. LIKE IF

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:41.085 region:rollup2
YOU TREATED WITH A ANTIBIOTIC IN

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:42.619 region:rollup2
A RECENT YEAH YOU HAVE TO WAIT

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:44.354 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BEFORE YOU CAN

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:45.522 region:rollup2
SELL THAT ANIMAL OR IT CAN BE

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:47.357 region:rollup2
PROCESSED TO GOING TO THE FOOD

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:48.392 region:rollup2
CHAIN. OR BE UTILIZED.

00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.893 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE IF THEY'RE STARTING

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:52.229 region:rollup2
TO USE THIS NOW THEY'RE USING

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:55.966 region:rollup2
OUTLOOK JUST LIKE LAMBS OR

00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:56.600 region:rollup2
HAIG'S OR CATTLE. YEAH IT.

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:57.968 region:rollup2
COULD VERY EASILY GET INTO THE

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.403 region:rollup2
FOOD STREAM IF THERE'S NO

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.572 region:rollup2
REGULATORY STATUTE.

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:03.574 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THIS AND

00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:05.242 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COULDN'T JUST THAT.

00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:06.744 region:rollup2
AND BE AFFECTED SO I THINK

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:09.246 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME CURIOSITY HERE THAT

00:54:06.744 --> 00:54:09.847 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE SOME STANDARDS.

00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.647 region:rollup2
THAT WAY AND AT LEAST HAVE A

00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:13.450 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION.

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:14.585 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THOSE IMPACTS MIGHT BE.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.320 region:rollup2

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:23.994 region:rollup2
COST BUT I DO WANT TO REMIND

FOLKS THAT.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:28.265 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE REALLY IS MAKING

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:30.000 region:rollup2
A DECISION BASED ON ON THE

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:31.668 region:rollup2
