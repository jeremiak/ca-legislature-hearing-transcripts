HOWEVER THE BILL HAS NOT YET BEEN TAKEN UP ON THE FLOOR OR PASSED BY THE ASSEMBLY. SO WE ARE NOT IN RECEIPT OF THAT BILL AGAIN THAT'S SB THIRTY FIVE IF YOU WERE. HAVE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY TO TESTIFY ON THAT MY APOLOGIES TO YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT UNTIL THAT BILL. GETS OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY. BEFORE WE HEAR PRESENTATIONS ON- SB FIVE NINE FOUR LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM CONSOLE WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. GLAZER HERE GLAZER HERE NIELSEN. HERTZBERG YEAH HERTZBERG HERE LEYVA YOUR LIVER HERE NEWMAN. OKAY WE HAVE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. NEWMAN GOOD MORNING. AT THE CENTER OF NEWMAN IS HERE ALSO LET ME MENTION FOR THE RECORD THAT CENTER NIELSEN'S OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE HE UNFORTUNATELY HAD A CONFLICT THIS MORNING I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD PREFER THAT WE- DELAY THIS YEAR IN FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TIME TO BE CONVENIENT FOR HIM HE INDICATED THAT NO HE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THE HEARING- GOING FORWARD SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S NOTED. ON THE RECORD. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE ONE BILL ON THE HEARING DOCKET I AM THE AUTHOR OF THAT BILL. SO I THINK I'VE ARRANGED IN ADVANCE TO TURN THE MATTER OVER TO- SENATOR NEWMAN TO- CHAIR- THE HEARING AT THIS POINT IN TIME. SO WHILE DURING THE GAVEL OVER TO SENATOR NEWMAN. SURE. YEAH THANK YOU MR GLAD TO HELP- AND SO WE ARE NO GOING TO HEAR SB FIVE NINE FOUR- AND PLEASE THE SENATE GLAZER PLEASE PRESENT. OKAY THAT'S OKAY TO PRESENT FROM MY CHAIR MISTER SHERMAN FOR SISTER. I'M GONNA MAKE AN EXCEPTION TODAY CENTIGRADE YES. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I'VE REALIZED THIS YEAR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THE SB FIVE NINETY FOUR AS YOU KNOW DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE RELEASE OF CENSUS DATA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THE CYCLE. WHICH THAT THE SUPREME COURT TO MOVE BACK THE DEADLINE FOR STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING BY SEVERAL MONTHS. DIGITAL DEADLINE WAS AUGUST FIFTEENTH OF THIS YEAR. THE NEW DEADLINE IS NOT FULLY SETTLED AND WILL LIKELY BE CLARIFIED BY THE SUPREME COURT. BUT MOST LIKELY BE SOMETIME BETWEEN LATE DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THIS EXTENSION THE ELECTIONS CALENDAR LEADING UP TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRIMARY NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED. TO RECONCILE THE REDISTRICTING TIMELINE WITH THE CANDIDATE FILING TIMELINE. TEND TO PROVIDE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WITH TIME TO RE PRECEPT. SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY AMONG OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. SHORTENING THE PERIOD FOR COLLECTING SIGNATURES IN LIEU. OF PAYING A FILING FEE. AND POTENTIALLY ALSO SHORTENING THE TIME PERIOD FOR FILING NOMINATION DOCUMENTS. DEPENDING ON HOW LATE THE SUPREME COURT SETS THE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE. TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ABBREVIATED TIMELINE THIS BILL REDUCES THE NASCENT THE NUMBER OF NECESSARY SIGNATURE TO SIGNATURE IN LIEU. IN PROPORTION TO THE REDUCTION IN TIME. AND ALSO GIVES CANDIDATES FOR BOARD OF A THE CAUSATION OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH DISTRICT DISTRICT RESIDENCY AT THE TIME NOMINATION PAPERS ARE FILED INSTEAD OF WHEN THEY'RE PULLED. SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ALSO MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES THE LOCAL REDISTRICTING PROCESS INCLUDING. ERECTING POTENTIAL AMBIGUITIES IN STATE LAW THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE REQUIRE A LOCAL MATCH TO BE APPROVED MORE THAN A MONTH EARLIER THAN WAS INTENDED. AND TO CREATING A MORE UNIFORM DEADLINE FOR SPECIAL DISTRICT READ REDISTRICTING. THAT ALSO ELIMINATES AN UNNECESSARILY EARLY DEADLINE FOR CERTAIN SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THESE CHANGES PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY AND TIME. TO DELIBERATE. WHILE PRESERVING TIME FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LINES. SB FIVE NINETY FOUR RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY WANT TO. EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE EXCEPTIONAL STAFF HERE IN THE SENATE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND IN THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. LEADERSHIP AND AMBLESIDE BOTH HOUSES AND BOTH SIDES AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION AND PUTTING THIS BILL TOGETHER AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE. I HAVE WITH ME SANTA CRUZ COUNTY REGISTRAR. TRICIA WEBER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLICK CLERKS. AND ELECTIONS. THEY DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT MISS WEBER WILL CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT THE ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS IMPORTANT. FOR ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION. AND I'M ALSO JOINED BY JEAN HURST REPRESENTING URBAN COUNTIES OF pOF THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU THE SENATOR GLAZERS LET LET'S BEGIN. TO SMITE WITH MISS WEBER MISSED WEBER YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES FOR YOUR TESTIMONY EACH OF THE WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES- WE WILL HAVE TWENTY MINUTES TOTAL- OF FOUR INPUT HERE FOR PER FOR WITNESSES PLUS PUBLIC COMMENT- MR EVERSLEY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN SENATOR GLAZER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TRICIA WEBER AND I'M THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CLERK REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. WALLER COMMITTEE IS EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL NINETY. WE ARE ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE NECESSARY ASPECT OF THE BILL AND THE ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. AS YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC CAUSED CENTER STATED DELAYS AND THOSE DELAYS HAVE HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE UPCOMING REDISTRICTING PROCESS. ELECTION OFFICIALS RECOGNIZE THAT CHANGES IN STATE LAW ARE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT THE SUCCESSFUL PRIMARY ELECTION IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND SB FIVE NINETY FOR HELP WITH THE SITUATION. FIRST OFF THE BILL OF MINE TO DATE FOR CERTAIN SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO SUBMIT THEIR DISTRICT LINES TO THE ELECTION OFFICIAL WHILE MAINTAINING THE DATE FOR COUNTIES TO SUBMIT THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISOR LINE. WILL HELP LOCAL OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE DATA MAPS AND EQUIVALENCY FILED IN A MANNER THAT IS USABLE SO ONCE THEY RECEIVE THE STATE LINES THEY WILL BE READY TO START THE REPRESSED CREASING TEAM PROCESS. NEXT SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ADDRESSES THE START DATE FOR THE SIGNATURE IN LIEU COLLECTION PERIOD WHICH IS THE FIRST ACTIVITY A CANDIDATE MAY UNDERTAKE AND THEIR RUN FOR AN ELECTION OUR PRIMARY ELECTION OFFICE. WITHOUT A CHANGE IN STATE LAW THE SIGNATURE IN LIEU PERIOD INSTEAD TO START ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH HOWEVER THE SOONEST YOU CAN QUESTION ON STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT LINES WILL BE FINALIZED IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH. CAUSING ELECTION OFFICIALS TO ISSUE SIGNATURE IN LIEU DOCUMENTS TO PEOPLE WHOSE DISTRICT ARE UNKNOWN OR SOME CANDIDATES WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO COLLECT SIGNATURES THAN OTHERS WHICH IS A DISPARITIES FRIEDMAN. UNFORTUNATELY COULD POSSIBLY FINALIZED AS LATE AS JANUARY FOURTEENTH IT'S AN ILL CONCEIVED EXPANSION REQUESTED BY THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION IS GRANTED BY THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. SB FIVE NINETY FOUR ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY SETTING THE DATE FOR SIGNIFICANTLY COLLECTION TO BEGIN SEVEN DAYS AFTER WHATEVER THE STATE STATE REDISTRICTING DEADLINE ENDS UP BEING. SENSIBLE WAITING A FIXED DATE TIED TO JANUARY FOURTEENTH WHICH WERE ARTIFICIALLY TRUNCATE THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS IF THE COURT RULES FOR AN EARLIER DATE. IN A SIMILAR MANNER THIS BILL CHANGES THE END DATE OF THE SIGNATURE AND LITTLE PERIOD AND THE BEGINNING DATE OF THE CANDIDATE NOMINATION PERIOD FROM SIX STATES STEP BY LAW. THE FORTY ONE DAYS IN FORTY SIX STATES RESPECTIVELY AFTER THE STATE REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I GUESS YOU PLEASE COMPLETE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY FINALLY THIS BILL DOES NOT MAIL THE LAST DAY TO COMPLETE CANDIDATE FILING WHICH IS SET BY WIDE EIGHTY EIGHT DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY OR EIGHTY THREE DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY IF AN INCUMBENT FAILED TO FILE FOR OFFICE. THIS IS A CRITICAL FEATURE OF THE BILL AS AN EXTENSION OF THESE DEADLINE HAS MAJOR DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS WHAT OTHER ELECTION DUTIES THAT CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY MAPPED OUT WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO CONDUCT. THE CURRENT RECALL ELECTION. REGISTERS ARE STILL CONCERNED THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ADEQUATELY IMPORTANT PROOF THE REDISTRICTING DATA THAT WE MAKE IT AS LATE AS JANUARY FOURTEENTH. HOWEVER SB FIVE NINETY FOUR PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY WITH THE EARLIEST DEADLINES AND MAINTAINS THE MOST CRUCIAL DEADLINE FOR CANDIDATE FILINGS. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SO. THAT NEXT. WE HAVE IN THIS FIRST AND LET ME JUST NOTE THAT. WE WILL BE GIVING OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT EQUAL TIME SO IF YOU THREE MINUTES SO FAR- MEASURES IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES. OR SO APPRECIATED PLEASE PROCEED. ABSOLUTELY MISS CARE.
