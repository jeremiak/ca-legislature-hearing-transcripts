00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:53.078 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.711 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY TRACKING THE

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:55.713 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THE EFFORTS

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:57.782 region:rollup2
--

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.683 region:rollup2
AND CHANGING TACK IF NEED BE IF

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.185 region:rollup2
IF EFFORTS ARE INEFFECTIVE --

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:02.020 region:rollup2
SAID.

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:03.755 region:rollup2
ANY THOUGHTS OR ADVICE YOU HAVE

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.623 region:rollup2
ON ON HOW TO DO THAT.

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:06.925 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IS

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:09.194 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:10.795 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENT PROJECT O IS OUR

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:13.064 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY GROUPS.

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:15.033 region:rollup2
AND THEIR INDICATING TO US WHAT

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:16.634 region:rollup2
AREAS THEY CAN COVER THROUGHOUT

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.536 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.137 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED AREAS AS WELL AS

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.472 region:rollup2
THE CITIES.

00:37:19.137 --> 00:37:22.407 region:rollup2
ARE WHERE LITERALLY GONNA BE

00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:24.209 region:rollup2
MAPPING THE BLOCK GROUPS THAT

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:26.244 region:rollup2
THEY CAN COVER AND WHERE WE HAVE

00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:27.946 region:rollup2
GAPS FORGET IDENTIFY THOSE EARLY

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.847 region:rollup2
ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN GET.

00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:32.016 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF VOLUNTEERS WHETHER

00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:34.085 region:rollup2
IT'S YOU KNOW COUNTY EMPLOYEES

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:36.821 region:rollup2
ARE CITY EMPLOYEES IN PLACE TO

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:38.256 region:rollup2
FILL THOSE GAPS --

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.291 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER THEY'RE ANY NEW

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.993 region:rollup2
BREEDERS THAT ARE HIRED THREE

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:44.596 region:rollup2
THE CENSUS BUREAU ALTHOUGH.

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:46.531 region:rollup2
THOSE AYE ENUMERATORS DO REQUIRE

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:49.434 region:rollup2
A CITIZENSHIP WHICH IS NEW

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:49.634 region:rollup2
CORRECT WELL IT'S DIFFERENT FROM

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:50.301 region:rollup2
LAST.

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:52.137 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:53.538 region:rollup2
LAST TIME THERE WAS A WAIVER SO

00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:54.973 region:rollup2
YEAH BASICALLY --

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:56.174 region:rollup2
YEAH WE REALIZE WE'RE GOING TO

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:58.009 region:rollup2
HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE OTHER

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:59.577 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AS WELL SO THAT'S WHAT

00:37:58.009 --> 00:38:01.012 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING WE'RE LITERALLY.

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:02.380 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH --

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:04.382 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.983 region:rollup2
THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.619 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM BY BLOCK

00:38:04.983 --> 00:38:09.654 region:rollup2
GROUP TO MAKE CERTAIN WE HAVE

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:11.356 region:rollup2
COVERAGE CREDIT.

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:13.358 region:rollup2
UP DURING THE TWENTY TEN SENSES

00:38:11.356 --> 00:38:15.894 region:rollup2
WE DID APPLY NUMBER OF METRICS

00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:17.328 region:rollup2
AT THE FRONT END OF OUR EFFORT

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.630 region:rollup2
M. OUT PARTNER ITH OTHER CITIES

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:20.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAD THE

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.300 region:rollup2
SAME CAPACITY YOUR RESOURCES.

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:23.368 region:rollup2
AND WE USE A COMMON TRACKING TO

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.503 region:rollup2
WILL SO WE EIGHT WERE ABLE TO

00:38:23.368 --> 00:38:27.872 region:rollup2
MONITOR RESPONSE RATES BY CENSUS

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:29.707 region:rollup2
TRACKS IN EACH OF OUR AREAS AND

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:30.341 region:rollup2
IN ANY TIME YOU DID AN ACTIVITY

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.943 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF THAT.

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:33.511 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN UP TICK IN OF THE

00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:35.213 region:rollup2
RESPONSE RATE FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:38.082 region:rollup2
GO AROUND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:40.018 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PUT THEM EMPLOY OTHER --

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THAT EFFORT BUT MY

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:43.087 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION TO CITIES AND

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.156 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN THE STATE IS MAKE

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:46.724 region:rollup2
GOOD FRIENDS WITH YOUR PLANNING

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:49.427 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE MY

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:52.096 region:rollup2
LIFE SAVERS YOU KNOW THEY DID A

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:53.398 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE DEEP DIVE INTO THE

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.599 region:rollup2
CENSUS TRACTS TICKET TELL ME

00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:56.201 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHERE.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:58.636 region:rollup2
WE NEED IT TICKLE SO WE COULD

00:38:56.201 --> 00:39:00.104 region:rollup2
DEPLOY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:01.739 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTS OF THE CITY WHERE WE

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:03.508 region:rollup2
KNEW WITH THE RESPONSE RATE WAS

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:05.276 region:rollup2
IN A WORKING --

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:07.478 region:rollup2
SO I THINK HAVING TECHNOLOGY

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:09.047 region:rollup2
TRAINING YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:11.516 region:rollup2
IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GOING TO

00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:12.617 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ALL DIGITAL US CENSUS

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:13.284 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS WE

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:14.586 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:16.187 region:rollup2
FOR THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS OF

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:18.122 region:rollup2
THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:19.858 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO SMARTPHONES THEY DON'T

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:21.726 region:rollup2
EVEN HAVE INTERNET OR CABLE IN

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:23.461 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSEHOLDS SO YOU HAVE TO

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:24.896 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT REALISTIC WAYS. TO

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:26.731 region:rollup2
HELP THEM PARTICIPATE AND THOSE

00:39:24.896 --> 00:39:29.200 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:31.002 region:rollup2
REALLY HELPFUL WITH I WILL HAVE

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.371 region:rollup2
OUR OWN LOCAL TO LOSE BUT IF THE

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2
STATE COULD FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:36.941 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN TRAIN US ON INVEST

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.709 region:rollup2
IN THAT THAT WOULD JUST BE A

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:41.179 region:rollup2
LIFESAVER [inaudible]

00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:43.014 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:44.449 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND AND AS YOU'RE

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:46.084 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.752 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU FOR YOU KNOW BEEN ABLE

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:49.420 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE HARD TO

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup2
REACH UP POPULATIONS?

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.659 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT AND

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.995 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:58.296 region:rollup2
HOW WILL HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT

00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:59.197 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE DUPLICATIONS I'M

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:02.166 region:rollup2
WITH [inaudible]

00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:03.635 region:rollup2
PARTNERS RIGHT SO YOU ALL KNOW

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:05.169 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOUR

00:40:03.635 --> 00:40:06.104 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION IS THE NET YOU'RE

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:07.272 region:rollup2
HAVING CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW

00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:09.207 region:rollup2
WHAT CENSUS TRACKS YOU'VE BEEN

00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:10.875 region:rollup2
TO AND YOU HAVEN'T HOW DO WE

00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:13.344 region:rollup2
ENSURE --

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:16.047 region:rollup2
I'M OF OF APPROACH THAT DOESN'T

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:16.614 region:rollup2
OFFER DUPLICATION WHEN WE REALLY

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:18.182 region:rollup2
NEED THAT COUNT TO BE SUPER

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:19.617 region:rollup2
ACCURATE.

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:22.453 region:rollup2
SO LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:24.656 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENT PROJECT IS TRYING TO

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:25.690 region:rollup2
COORDINATE OTHERCBO'S.

00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:27.258 region:rollup2
SO --

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.193 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY WHICH IS A

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:30.261 region:rollup2
HUGE UNDERTAKING I'M JUST

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.263 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICALLY --

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:34.232 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WE HAVE URBAN SUBURBAN

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.733 region:rollup2
AND RURAL AREAS SO IT'S A PRETTY

00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:36.367 region:rollup2
BIG CHARGE FOR THEM.

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.937 region:rollup2
BUT THEY SO FAR HAVE BEEN LEAST

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
--

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:40.939 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE GROUPS AND I'M SURE

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.441 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:44.108 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.510 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN AND BY THE TIME THEY

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
WERE DONE --

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.012 region:rollup2
A PULLING TOGETHER THE VARIOUS

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.815 region:rollup2
--

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:53.451 region:rollup2
CBS AND THEY'D HAVE HAD --

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:55.687 region:rollup2
STRONG SUPPORT FROM CCF AS A

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:57.121 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION AND AND I THINK

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:58.489 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE OTHER FOUNDATIONS

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.390 region:rollup2
THAT WILL STEP UP TO HELP

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:01.125 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.694 region:rollup2
THAT EFFORT IN LOS ANGELES

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.961 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO THAT'S MORE OR LESS

00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:05.430 region:rollup2
HOW WE ARE.

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:07.098 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ATTACKING IT AND I

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.467 region:rollup2
THINK THROUGH THE STATE SORTS

00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:11.569 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHICH IS THIS AZRI BASED.

00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:14.405 region:rollup2
SYSTEM I WILL BE ABLE TO GET

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:16.607 region:rollup2
REAL TIME RESPONSE --

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:18.943 region:rollup2
AND ARE LA COUNTY --

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:20.812 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS ALSO AS THREE PLATFORM

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:22.480 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL BE ABLE.

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:24.282 region:rollup2
TO HAVE ALL OF OUR DATA MAPPED

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.550 region:rollup2
ONTO THE STATE SYSTEM AND WE

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:27.085 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE OUR

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:29.053 region:rollup2
COUNTY FACILITIES THAT CAN BE

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:31.089 region:rollup2
UTILIZED. FOR CENSUS ACTION HE

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:33.291 region:rollup2
ASKS AS WELL AS CHURCHES AND

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:34.392 region:rollup2
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SO THERE'S A

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:35.193 region:rollup2
LOT OF COORDINATION.

00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:37.662 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:40.832 region:rollup2
US SOME OF THE TOOLS WERE

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:41.999 region:rollup2
STARTING TO WORK ON AND I THINK

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.568 region:rollup2
FOR SAN FRANCISCO.

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:46.270 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND WE WERE

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:47.672 region:rollup2
UNDER COUNT IT BY A HUNDRED

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:50.341 region:rollup2
THOUSAND RESIDENTS SO WE LEARN

00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:51.676 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FROM THAT EFFORT IN.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN UP BY REALLY BEING

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:55.346 region:rollup2
REAL ABOUT OUR STRATEGY IN OUR

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.749 region:rollup2
APPROACH WE DID CITYWIDE

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:59.450 region:rollup2
TRAINING CITY DEPARTMENTS EVERY

00:41:57.749 --> 00:42:00.918 region:rollup2
SINGLE EMPLOYEE NOT SITTING

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.087 region:rollup2
COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT IT

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:04.622 region:rollup2
ANY SORT OF PUBLIC CONTACT.

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:07.759 region:rollup2
WE TRAINED OUR OWN WORKERS WHO

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:09.427 region:rollup2
TRAINS OF CBO'S EVERYBODY GOT

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:10.895 region:rollup2
TRAINED IN THE SAME WAY UP

00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:12.630 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COORDINATE YOU

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:14.098 region:rollup2
KNOW EVERYBODY'S GOT THESE CROSS

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.433 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS THEY WORK.

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:16.734 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE THAT WORK

00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:18.302 region:rollup2
REGION ONLY --

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:20.004 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:21.906 region:rollup2
DOING THEIR OWN THING WITHOUT

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:23.775 region:rollup2
LETTING OTHER PEOPLE KNOW PAPER

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:25.676 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THIS THE FAITH BASED

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:27.011 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING ON THE

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:29.247 region:rollup2
CONGREGATIONS THAT THERE'S NO

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:32.183 region:rollup2
NEED TO OVERLAP AND AND DO THAT.

00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:33.618 region:rollup2
THERE'S A YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:36.487 region:rollup2
NO MONEY LAW AT AS NONE OF US

00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:10.380 region:rollup2
THAT THE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO

VOTE IS COUNTER INTUITIVELY.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.650 region:rollup2
NOT TO LEAD WITH THE

ABOUT IMAGINING A BETTER FUTURE.

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:23.327 region:rollup2
THE SAME APPROACH SHOULD BE

00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:25.562 region:rollup2
TAKEN WITH THE CENSUS.

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:26.830 region:rollup2

00:54:56.994 --> 00:55:00.297 region:rollup2
WE NEED A ROBUST OUTREACH AND

00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:01.832 region:rollup2
EDUCATION COMPONENT TO START IN

00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.733 region:rollup2

CANVASSERS ONE CENSUS FORMS

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.608 region:rollup2

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:14.044 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY THIS PRIMING THE

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:15.245 region:rollup2
PUMP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:18.348 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINETEEN IS AS IMPORTANT

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:18.882 region:rollup2

CONTRACTING.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.821 region:rollup2
BASED ON LESSONS FROM THE

00:55:22.486 --> 00:55:25.923 region:rollup2
200-020-0010 CENSUSES

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:27.524 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING IN MOST CASES SHOULD

00:55:25.923 --> 00:55:29.359 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:31.295 region:rollup2
NOT CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CBS HAVE A BETTER GRASP

00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:33.630 region:rollup2
ON THE NONPROFIT LANDSCAPE AND

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:35.532 region:rollup2

COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.713 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ENORMOUS EFFORT THAT

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:51.381 region:rollup2
WILL REQUIRE CLOSE

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:54.251 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIONS ACROSS SECTORS

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:55.919 region:rollup2

MEANS LITIGATION.

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.328 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY RESOURCES.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.096 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCES WILL LIKELY BE

00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:07.898 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:09.066 region:rollup2

STATE HAS EVER INVESTED.

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:14.504 region:rollup2

JUST FOR CBO OUTREACH ALONE.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.617 region:rollup2

RECRUITING FOLKS TO BE EMPLOYED

COMMUNITIES.

00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:51.868 region:rollup2
THESE ARE FOLKS FROM

00:57:50.267 --> 00:57:54.071 region:rollup2
CONGREGATIONS FROM COMMUNITY

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:55.038 region:rollup2
BASED ORGANIZATIONS FROM SCHOOLS

00:57:54.071 --> 00:57:56.039 region:rollup2
IN THESE HARD TO COUNT

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:59.109 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:59.609 region:rollup2
WITH US SINCE AT LEAST.

00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:00.544 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE DOOR VOTER

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.979 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT WORK.

00:58:00.544 --> 00:58:03.847 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:05.415 region:rollup2
CENSUS WORK BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:06.883 region:rollup2
US TO TALK TO EVERYONE AND

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:08.385 region:rollup2
HEARTY CAN COMMUNITIES NOT JUST

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.952 region:rollup2
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE THOSE WHO

00:58:08.385 --> 00:58:09.252 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGISTER

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:14.057 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:15.258 region:rollup2
YOU CAN.

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:16.927 region:rollup2
THYROID GET CARRY.

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:18.428 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE A BIT OF A CONCERN

00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:20.230 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT THE BY RURAL

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:22.199 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES --

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.466 region:rollup2
MANY THE REAL COMMUNITIES OF AN

00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:24.534 region:rollup2
BEEN -- LA

00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:25.569 region:rollup2
FIRES.

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:27.404 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE LOSING PEOPLE LEFT

00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:29.706 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT AND THE NONPROFITS ARE

00:58:27.404 --> 00:58:30.674 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO PROBABLY PICK UP --

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.842 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
WHERE CAN WE GET ADDITIONAL

00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.711 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:37.814 region:rollup2
DO THE CENSUS FORCE I'M REALLY

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:39.583 region:rollup2
CONCERNED IS THAT --

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:41.485 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION THERE I DON'T

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:43.220 region:rollup2
THINK SING IT NECESSARY COUNTY.

00:58:41.485 --> 00:58:45.222 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT NAUNTON ONE OF THE

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.690 region:rollup2
STRENGTHS OF NONPROFITS IS THAT

00:58:45.222 --> 00:58:47.791 region:rollup2
WERE IN EVERY COMMUNITY AS I

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.793 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER EVEN OUR

00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:50.961 region:rollup2
MEMBERS ARE IN FIFTY SEVEN OF

00:58:49.793 --> 00:58:51.528 region:rollup2

COUNTIES.

00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:54.531 region:rollup2
AND OUR MEMBERS WHO WERE IN

00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:56.166 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITIES AS YOU KNOW

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:57.667 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS STRIVING AROUND --

00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:59.069 region:rollup2
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER SO

00:58:57.667 --> 00:59:00.370 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALREADY REACHING A LOT

00:58:59.069 --> 00:59:02.005 region:rollup2
OF THESE PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.773 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:05.108 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:06.476 region:rollup2
AND AS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:08.645 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:09.446 region:rollup2
ANNA AGAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.113 region:rollup2
TO THE FOOD BANKS AND OTHER

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:11.548 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:12.949 region:rollup2
AYE THEY KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:14.117 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AND

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:15.585 region:rollup2
GLAD TO DO THIS WORK OF

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:16.486 region:rollup2
ENUMERATION.

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:19.856 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT SO I ACTUALLY

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:20.457 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT WE SAW IN THE TWENTY

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:21.958 region:rollup2

00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:23.994 region:rollup2
--

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:25.228 region:rollup2
JUST BE ENORMOUS SUCCESS AND

00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:26.863 region:rollup2
NONPROFITS RECRUITING

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.731 region:rollup2
ENUMERATORS NOW THAT'S AN URBAN

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:29.132 region:rollup2
AREA.

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:30.500 region:rollup2
BUT I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE IT

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:31.902 region:rollup2
WAS ON THE GROUND COMMUNITY

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.603 region:rollup2
NONPROFITS THAT DID THAT

00:59:31.902 --> 00:59:34.504 region:rollup2
RECRUITING FOR APPLICATIONS THAT

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.038 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE MUCH MORE

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:38.475 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL THAN SOME OTHER

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:39.810 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:59:38.475 --> 00:59:41.945 region:rollup2
JUST JUST ONE THING I THINK A

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:44.314 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE OTHER PHILANTHROPY

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:45.782 region:rollup2
AND LARGE NONPROFITS I TEND TO

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:47.918 region:rollup2
BE IN THE METRO AREAS.

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:50.220 region:rollup2
AND AND SO I THINK THAT --

00:59:47.918 --> 00:59:52.155 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT OUR ABILITY TO TO

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.590 region:rollup2
BE IN EVERY COUNTY WE JUST HAVE

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:56.493 region:rollup2
TO GET SOMEBODY FROM ALPINE

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:58.628 region:rollup2
COUNTY WILL BE IN --

00:59:56.493 --> 01:00:00.464 region:rollup2
FIFTY A REALLY GIVES US A UNIQUE

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.566 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO AT THAT OUR FOCUS IS

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:04.468 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ON THE AREAS OUTSIDE

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:06.269 region:rollup2
THE METRO AREAS WHERE THERE'S

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:09.005 region:rollup2
LESS REACH FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:10.707 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD DECIDE ON THAT IN A

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:12.576 region:rollup2
BEAT SENSE TWENTY TEN THERE'S

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:14.144 region:rollup2
BEEN A MASSIVE INVESTMENT AND

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:16.480 region:rollup2
BUILDING COMMUNITY ORGANIZING

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:18.482 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IN RURAL AREAS SO.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.150 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY TWENTY IT'S ALMOST

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.017 region:rollup2
NIGHT AND DAY IN TERMS OF SOME

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.285 region:rollup2
OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.919 region:rollup2
GROUND IN PLACES LIKE THE

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:25.122 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY THE INLAND EMPIRE

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:26.923 region:rollup2
--

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:28.425 region:rollup2
CUT AND THE NORTH VALLEY OF

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:30.427 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO --

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:31.928 region:rollup2
THIS YOU KNOW DEL NORD HUMBLE

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:34.164 region:rollup2
COUNTIES KIND OF THE BORDER WITH

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:35.732 region:rollup2
OREGON SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:37.100 region:rollup2
OF CONFIDENCE AS WELL BASED UPON

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.235 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WE

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.436 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH COMMUNITY BASED

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:40.403 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL BE ABLE

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:41.638 region:rollup2
TO FIND.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:43.807 region:rollup2
THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE --

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.441 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN WE HAVE

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:48.378 region:rollup2
TO START NOUN IT'S NOT GONNA BE

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:49.513 region:rollup2
EASY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.715 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD --

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:52.682 region:rollup2
YOU BOTH OF YOU MENTION IS THE

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:55.285 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT.

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:58.221 region:rollup2
THIS WORK NEEDS JUST BEGIN NOW

01:00:55.285 --> 01:01:00.524 region:rollup2
AND AND WE THERE'S ALSO A

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:02.392 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE AND THAT WE CAME

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:03.593 region:rollup2
HIGHER -- OR

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:06.363 region:rollup2
BRING ONBOARD VOLUNTEERS TO DO

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:07.964 region:rollup2

FROM MY LANDS.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.971 region:rollup2
I'M THINKING WE NEED TO DO MORE

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:18.074 region:rollup2
NOW -- WE

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:20.110 region:rollup2
NEED TO HAVE A POOL OF THE IRA.

OF THE LARGEST STATE NETWORKS OF

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
CBO'S AND NONPROFITS IN THE

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:10.827 region:rollup2

AND SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:23.807 region:rollup2
BEEN GROWING OUR CAPACITY TO

REACH VOTERS PRIMARILY IN THESE

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:27.010 region:rollup2
HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES.

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:28.545 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.946 region:rollup2

OUR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:37.020 region:rollup2
AND SO ON AND SO WE HAVE A TRACK

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:39.889 region:rollup2
RECORD OF TAKING FOLKS THROUGH A

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:41.191 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAM SENSE.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:42.325 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE IN THE PRINCIPLES

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.260 region:rollup2
AND PRACTICES OF RELATION BASED

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:46.062 region:rollup2
ORGANIZING --

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.465 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO GOING

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:51.167 region:rollup2
DOOR TO DOOR INTO SCHOOLS INTO

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:52.669 region:rollup2
CONGREGATIONS INTO BUSINESSES

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:54.838 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE IN HEARTS CAN'T

01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:56.906 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES LIVE AND WORK.

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:58.508 region:rollup2
CONTACT HAVE DEEP CONVERSATIONS

01:02:56.906 --> 01:03:00.043 region:rollup2
WITH THEM ABOUT THE KIND OF

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.678 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THEY WANT TO PASS ON

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:04.080 region:rollup2
TO THEIR CHILDREN.

01:03:01.678 --> 01:03:06.116 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND THAT THAT KIND OF

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.018 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BASED FACE TO FACE

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.753 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS ARE FAR MORE

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.721 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE ANECDOTALLY AND THE

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:13.623 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS IT --

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:14.457 region:rollup2
THAT PROFESSORS FROM UC SANTA

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.126 region:rollup2

AMAZING --

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:24.567 region:rollup2

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:26.169 region:rollup2
ONCE THE ENUMERATOR KIND OF JOB

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:27.570 region:rollup2

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:07.337 region:rollup2
YOU IN A DO YOU HAVE ANY.

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.805 region:rollup2
ANSWER HERS --

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.439 region:rollup2

WITH.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.510 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES --

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.578 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WORK WITH ON WHAT DOES

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
RESONATE WHAT DOES KIND OF GIVE

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.748 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THE IN THE COMFORT THAT

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.683 region:rollup2
THEY NEED --

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:22.252 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS.

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:23.653 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK JOSEPH'S POINT

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.921 region:rollup2
ABOUT RELATIONS SOME MONEY YOU

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.256 region:rollup2
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MAKES A

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.824 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I ALSO HAVE

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.492 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT RIGHT NOW MOST OF

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:31.327 region:rollup2
THE MEDIA IS ABOUT ANXIETY ABOUT

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:33.096 region:rollup2
THE CENSUS.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.530 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT EMITTING MESSAGES

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.598 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:37.467 region:rollup2
POSITIVENESS.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:40.069 region:rollup2
OF THE CENSUS AND AS A RESULT I

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:42.071 region:rollup2
THINK THAT BY OVER PLANE ANXIETY

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:43.807 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:46.042 region:rollup2
INCREASED ANXIETY ABOUT IT.

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:47.911 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY LATE IN GETTING OUT

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.579 region:rollup2
THE MESSAGES ABOUT THE

01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:51.381 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS HIVE

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:53.583 region:rollup2
SAFETY OF THE CENSUS ALL THOSE

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:55.318 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:57.387 region:rollup2
YEAH I I WOULD I WOULD REINFORCE

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:59.389 region:rollup2
THAT POINT I THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:01.224 region:rollup2
A WAYS TO GO STILL AND THEN

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE TRUST THAT WE NEED

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.459 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.928 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:06.162 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:08.131 region:rollup2
BEEN UNDER ATTACK FOR THE LAST

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:10.033 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS --

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.302 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT YES AS I SAID

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:14.337 region:rollup2
EARLIER THE MESSENGER IS AS

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.004 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS THE MESSAGE JUNE --

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.306 region:rollup2
BUT THE MESSAGE IS GONNA MATTER

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.807 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND SOME OF THAT IS

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.242 region:rollup2
BEING.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.777 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTED WITH AS I MENTIONED

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:21.878 region:rollup2
THROUGH A A RESEARCH PROJECT

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:23.246 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

SPOKEN TO A FEW FOLKS IT'S IS

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:33.189 region:rollup2
THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:34.691 region:rollup2
INFORMATION COLLECTED OR IF

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:36.860 region:rollup2
STATE DOLLARS ARE USED TO HELP

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.961 region:rollup2
COLLECT INFORMATION FROM FOLKS

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.696 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING THE CENSUS IS

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY IN SOME WAY TO THE

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:43.399 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:45.001 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE CAN LIKE USE THAT

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.569 region:rollup2

ALL THREE PANELS AND THERE'S

01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:04.933 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY 驮MENTS

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:06.468 region:rollup2
THEMES THAT YOU'VE ALL KIND OF

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:08.170 region:rollup2
SHARED IN THERE'S ELEMENTS.

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:09.805 region:rollup2
AND THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:12.341 region:rollup2
I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS NOW

01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:13.775 region:rollup2
HAVING HEARD ALL THREE AND YOU

01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.910 region:rollup2
THREE HAPPENED TO BE THE ONES

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.078 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HERE TO ANSWER THIS

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:19.281 region:rollup2
QUESTION --

01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:24.319 region:rollup2
BUT SO IS THAT THERE WAS A

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:26.321 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF OF OF ERROR IT

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:27.356 region:rollup2
TONE OF KIND OF THE THE STATE OF

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:30.158 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS MADE A NINETY

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:32.227 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT --

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:33.829 region:rollup2
AND I HEARD.

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:35.464 region:rollup2
IT KIND OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:36.498 region:rollup2
AND GOVERNMENTS MAKE A CASE AS

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:39.134 region:rollup2
TO WHY.

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:39.801 region:rollup2
THEY ARE INEFFECTIVE AND ENTITY

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:42.037 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF TAKE ON SOME OF THE

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:43.772 region:rollup2
FUNDING I HEARD THE NON PROFITS

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:44.906 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME AND I'M HEARING

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:49.544 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONS DO THE SAME.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:50.078 region:rollup2
SO NOW MY QUESTION IS IS A WHAT.

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.947 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO IS THE

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:53.915 region:rollup2
RIGHT?

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:55.617 region:rollup2
WHERE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO MAKE

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:57.052 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AND WHO

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:59.921 region:rollup2
IS NOT -- SO

01:25:57.052 --> 01:26:01.623 region:rollup2
NOT JUST HERE'S WHY THE FOUNDING

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.059 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT WELL WAIT A GREAT

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:05.694 region:rollup2
PLACE TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:08.063 region:rollup2
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:12.601 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO

01:26:08.063 --> 01:26:14.036 region:rollup2
MAKE THE INVESTMENT AS WELL?

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:15.837 region:rollup2
RIGHT OUT CERTAIN ASSURE THAT

01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:17.205 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.974 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE PLACE TO

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:21.410 region:rollup2
MAKE THE INVESTMENT SO THERE'S A

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:24.079 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:24.980 region:rollup2
PLAY WHEN IT COMES --

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:27.849 region:rollup2

COMMUNITIES SO I'M AS FAR AS TO

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.306 region:rollup2
WHO TO FIND THEM WHERE TO PUT IT

01:26:50.072 --> 01:26:52.641 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ABOUT.

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:54.443 region:rollup2
WHERE IS THERE ARE GENUINE

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:56.044 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DRIVEN ENGAGEMENT AND

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:57.746 region:rollup2
THEN WORKING WITH PHILANTHROPY

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.414 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND --

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:02.050 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NONPROFIT PARTNERS THAT

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:03.618 region:rollup2
WE MAYBE DON'T SEE IN IN OUR AYE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:05.120 region:rollup2
FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT BUT I

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:06.621 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THE REASON A LOT OF IT

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.156 region:rollup2
FOCUSES BACK TO THE STATE IS

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:09.925 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT ALL BEGINS WITH THE

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:11.359 region:rollup2
TEMPLE THAT THE STATE SETS?

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.761 region:rollup2
IF THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:15.897 region:rollup2
ARE PUT INTO VERY RESTRICTIVE

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:17.766 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS ONE WE GOTTA TRY TO

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.900 region:rollup2
WORK AND ENGAGE NONPROFITS WE

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:20.602 region:rollup2
WILL BE HAVING.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.970 region:rollup2
TO INVEST RESOURCES TO HELP

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:23.438 region:rollup2
MITIGATE AND HAVE THEM MEET

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:25.574 region:rollup2
THOSE OBLIGATIONS VERSES HOW DO

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:26.408 region:rollup2
YOU EXPAND AND DEEPEN YOUR WORK

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:30.312 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S TAKING THE STATE'S

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:32.481 region:rollup2
LEAD IN THE SENSE THAT THE WAY

01:27:30.312 --> 01:27:33.949 region:rollup2
THAT THESE GRANTS IN THIS MONEY

01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:36.752 region:rollup2
GOES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY.

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:38.854 region:rollup2
WALL EITHER HELP US TO AMPLIFY

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:40.021 region:rollup2
AND EXPAND THE WORK OR CAN SORT

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:41.590 region:rollup2
OF CREATE A HINDRANCE FOR US

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:43.091 region:rollup2
WHERE WE PUT OUR MONEY.

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.159 region:rollup2
SO A LOT OF IT IS LAST ON

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.093 region:rollup2
DIRECTING WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:47.028 region:rollup2
THE MONEY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.996 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN A NUMBER

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.231 region:rollup2
OF AREAS NONPROFIT LOCAL

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:51.032 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:53.635 region:rollup2
BUT MORE ON HOW YOU STRUCTURE

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:55.904 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY IS GOING TO DICTATE.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:58.306 region:rollup2
HOW NONPROFITS PERFORM AND HOW

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:58.874 region:rollup2
WE CAN THEN LEVERAGE THAT TO

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.275 region:rollup2
BUILD UPON THAT MORE I HOPE

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:01.977 region:rollup2
THAT?

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:05.614 region:rollup2
KIND OF ADDRESSES [inaudible]

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:06.848 region:rollup2
SOME AMERICAN.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.617 region:rollup2
SURE ARE GONNA.

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:09.718 region:rollup2
THIS IS A CROSS SECTOR PROBLEM

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:12.521 region:rollup2
THE MINUTE WE ALL OF US NEED TO

01:28:09.718 --> 01:28:14.523 region:rollup2
STEP UP AND DO OUR PART --

01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:15.724 region:rollup2
AND BUT THE PEOPLE IN THE

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:17.392 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THE NONPROFITS TO THE

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:18.226 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:20.095 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN REFERENCED HERE MANY

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:20.729 region:rollup2
TIMES ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:22.864 region:rollup2
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT'S

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:24.733 region:rollup2
WHERE THE THE ENERGY OF THE

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:27.235 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THE WORK IS REALLY CAN

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.836 region:rollup2
BE DONE AND COMMUNITY --

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:31.039 region:rollup2
ON A PHILANTHROPIC PERSPECTIVE

01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:33.942 region:rollup2
WE CONVENE --

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:35.977 region:rollup2
INVEST AND THAT YOU KNOW

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:37.846 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE YOU KNOW COMING HERE

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:41.750 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE GOES THERE AND

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:43.351 region:rollup2
PLAY SOME ACTIVATION ROLE --

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.787 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT.

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:47.155 region:rollup2
YET ACTIVATED SO HERE WORSE HAVE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.757 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP IN THE

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.525 region:rollup2
PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR IS HERE

01:28:48.757 --> 01:28:51.927 region:rollup2
TODAY AND LARGE --

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:53.929 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS OF

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:54.829 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANCE ARE SITTING AT THE

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:55.463 region:rollup2
TABLE TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.032 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:58.767 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE PHILANTHROPY OUT

01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:00.268 region:rollup2
THERE THAT IS NOT QUITE --

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:01.436 region:rollup2
UP TO SPEED ON THIS YET AND

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:03.471 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF OUR JOB

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:05.941 region:rollup2
AS PARTICULAR POSSIBLE TRUE AND

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:07.576 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HARDEST ACCOUNT --

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:09.244 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE --

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:10.579 region:rollup2
AS MUCH ATTENTION LOCALLY TO

01:29:09.244 --> 01:29:12.347 region:rollup2
THIS AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE TALKED

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:13.715 region:rollup2
A LOT ABOUT THAT WHEN WE GET WE

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.916 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO DO TO HELP THOSE

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:16.084 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES --

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:17.686 region:rollup2
ACTIVATE WHATEVER IT TAKES

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:19.221 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON THE REALITIES IN THE

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:21.122 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THAT PARTICULAR PLACE

01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:22.057 region:rollup2
I'M TO GET THE MONEY OUT ON THE

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:24.392 region:rollup2
ENERGY ON THE WORK DONE IN THE

01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:25.360 region:rollup2
VOICE -- AND

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:27.562 region:rollup2
THE WORD OUT --

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.097 region:rollup2
TO GET DISCOUNT DONE.

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:30.799 region:rollup2
NO JUST ECHO MY COLLEAGUE'S

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:32.734 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND I WOULD JUST SAY NO

01:29:30.799 --> 01:29:33.535 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.604 region:rollup2
LIKE HOW.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:36.972 region:rollup2
HOW WE INVEST BUT IT'S ALSO

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:38.506 region:rollup2
MULTI PRONGED APPROACH YOUR NEW

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:40.208 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:41.643 region:rollup2
GETS THE MONEY BUT HOW IT GETS

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.944 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED WHETHER IT'S?

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:45.146 region:rollup2
DIRECT ON THE GROUND OUTREACH

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:46.014 region:rollup2
VERSUS COMMUNICATION AND WE HAVE

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.882 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE FROM PAST

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:48.183 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WEATHERS THE

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:49.651 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ANYTHING

01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:50.919 region:rollup2
ELSE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT HAS

01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:52.220 region:rollup2
TO BE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH.

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:53.755 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.257 region:rollup2
YOU THE STATE WILL HAVE.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:56.725 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCES THAN WE WILL HAVE

01:29:55.257 --> 01:29:57.592 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.226 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.294 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:01.796 region:rollup2
HOW THE STATE'S LEVERAGING THOSE

01:29:59.294 --> 01:30:03.732 region:rollup2
RESOURCES SUPPORTIVE AND

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:05.300 region:rollup2
COMPLIMENTARY?

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:07.168 region:rollup2
AND I THINK I WOULD ALSO ECHO

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.470 region:rollup2
THAT -- YOU

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:10.171 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT POPULATION

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:12.207 region:rollup2
IN REGION AND SOME COMMENTS

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:14.175 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT REMAIN --

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:15.243 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:17.045 region:rollup2
THAT AREN'T AS STRONG AS IN

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:18.446 region:rollup2
OTHER REGIONS AND YOU MAY ALSO

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:19.481 region:rollup2
WANT TO LOOK AT THAT --

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:20.916 region:rollup2
AND ALSO LOOK AT THE CENTRAL

01:30:19.481 --> 01:30:23.885 region:rollup2
VALLEY IS A PLACE I MAY GO UNDER

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:24.486 region:rollup2
INVESTED.

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:25.887 region:rollup2
AND THE THE IMPORTANT THING IS

01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:27.355 region:rollup2
--

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:29.457 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE HEARING IT HERE TODAY

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:31.793 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE NOT STARTING AT ZERO

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:33.495 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT.

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:34.696 region:rollup2
MILLION VOTERS PROJECT YOU'VE

01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:36.731 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT THE WORK ACCOUNT

01:30:34.696 --> 01:30:37.532 region:rollup2
NUMBER THERE'S PIPELINES ON HOW

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:39.501 region:rollup2
YOU GET.

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:41.836 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:43.505 region:rollup2
INTO VERY LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:44.906 region:rollup2
IMPACT THERE'S PIPELINES THERE'S

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:47.409 region:rollup2
MAJOR STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:48.643 region:rollup2
LIKE PICO CALIFORNIA CALLS

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:50.111 region:rollup2
ADVANCEMENT PROJECT.

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:52.681 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SET UP TO FUNNEL THAT

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:54.382 region:rollup2
WAY COUNT NONPROFITS AND SO.

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.750 region:rollup2
A KEY PART IS WE'RE NOT STARTING

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:57.152 region:rollup2
ZERO THERE'S ACTUALLY PIPELINE

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:58.687 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW YOU MOVE SUPPORT INTO

01:30:57.152 --> 01:31:00.121 region:rollup2
THESE AREAS AND WILL BE KEY FOR

01:30:58.687 --> 01:31:01.990 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:04.025 region:rollup2
STITCH INTO THAT AND AND WORK

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.426 region:rollup2
ITS PLAN IN THAT WAY RATHER THAN

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:06.061 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CREATE.

01:31:04.426 --> 01:31:07.696 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS.

01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:08.330 region:rollup2
CRAIG AND I AND I DO APPRECIATE

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:09.698 region:rollup2
THAT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:11.766 region:rollup2
--

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:13.501 region:rollup2
EATS IN I THINK YOU HAD THE

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:15.070 region:rollup2
COMMENT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:16.538 region:rollup2
INVEST IN EXISTING.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:17.806 region:rollup2
AND INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS ARE

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:19.774 region:rollup2
MODELS AS OPPOSED TO CREATING

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:21.843 region:rollup2
NEW ONES AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.877 region:rollup2
I'M A POWERFUL THING I THINK IT

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:25.613 region:rollup2
SPEAKS TO THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:27.148 region:rollup2
DONE BUT ALSO INTO THE ABILITY.

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:29.217 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THAT THESE POTENTIAL

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:31.119 region:rollup2
FUNDS -- AND

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:33.188 region:rollup2
USE THEM IN A WAY THAT'S

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:34.723 region:rollup2
EXPANSIVE THAT SUPPLEMENTS I'M

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:37.092 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEING

01:31:34.723 --> 01:31:37.659 region:rollup2
DOING AS OPPOSED TO NEO --

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:40.261 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOU WERE ALL VERY

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:41.229 region:rollup2
CAREFUL THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.364 region:rollup2
SHOULD GO YOU DID NOT TELL ME

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:43.498 region:rollup2
WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD NOT GO

01:31:42.364 --> 01:31:44.833 region:rollup2
AND SO I STILL LEAVE THAT

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:46.034 region:rollup2
QUESTION OUT THERE BECAUSE I

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:47.202 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT

01:31:46.034 --> 01:31:48.236 region:rollup2
KNOWING YOU KNOW YES WHERE

01:31:47.202 --> 01:31:49.871 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL MONEY SHOULD GO.

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:51.373 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE SHOULDN'T NAKO I THINK

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:52.974 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE GOT

01:31:51.373 --> 01:31:54.142 region:rollup2
PERHAPS YOU KNOW BEING.

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:55.643 region:rollup2
I'M A LITTLE THOUGHTFUL AND

01:31:54.142 --> 01:31:58.346 region:rollup2
WHETHER WHERE IT'S GOING TO

01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:59.614 region:rollup2
PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE A HISTORY

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.915 region:rollup2
OF BEING ABLE TO GENERATE.

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:02.751 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES WERE LOOKING FOR

01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:04.753 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THE STATE CONSIDER

01:32:02.751 --> 01:32:07.222 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE A GRANT VERSUS A

01:32:04.753 --> 01:32:08.757 region:rollup2
CONTRACT MODEL AND I THINK FROM

01:32:07.222 --> 01:32:10.158 region:rollup2

01:59:45.145 --> 01:59:48.815 region:rollup2
CONVENING THIS I THINK THAT THE

01:59:47.047 --> 01:59:51.551 region:rollup2
FACT THAT YOU SEE TWO HOUSES

01:59:48.815 --> 01:59:53.753 region:rollup2
HERE BOTH SENATE AND ASSEMBLY --

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:55.021 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH THREE DIFFERENT

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:57.390 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES --

01:59:55.021 --> 01:59:59.259 region:rollup2
A COMING TOGETHER IS REALLY --

01:59:57.390 --> 02:00:01.761 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT EMPHASIZES

01:59:59.259 --> 02:00:03.163 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THIS ISSUE MEANS TO THE

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:04.831 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO THE

02:00:03.163 --> 02:00:07.100 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO ON I

02:00:04.831 --> 02:00:08.868 region:rollup2
THINK THAT ALL THOSE AYE WHO

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.502 region:rollup2
CONVENE THIS ALL THOSE THAT

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:11.404 region:rollup2
WORKED ON THE COMMITTEE AND THE

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:12.572 region:rollup2
STAFF.

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:13.606 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE PRISONERS AND THANK

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:14.841 region:rollup2
YOU FOR BEING HERE FROM COMING

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:16.443 region:rollup2
FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES I

02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:18.712 region:rollup2
THINK YOUR MESSAGES WERE LOUD

02:00:16.443 --> 02:00:19.913 region:rollup2
AND CLEAR I'M WE HEARD A LOUD

02:00:18.712 --> 02:00:21.247 region:rollup2
AND CLEAR THAT KNOWS THAT ONE

02:00:19.913 --> 02:00:21.715 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL.

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:23.483 region:rollup2
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:00:21.715 --> 02:00:24.451 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY --

02:00:23.483 --> 02:00:25.485 region:rollup2
AND THAT --

02:00:24.451 --> 02:00:27.721 region:rollup2
OUR APPROACH HAS TO BE

02:00:25.485 --> 02:00:29.589 region:rollup2
MULTIFACETED NOT JUST LOOKING AT

02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:31.791 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES OR COUNTIES BUT

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:32.625 region:rollup2
ALSO CBO'S AND NONPROFITS

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.560 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER.

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:36.496 region:rollup2
THAT WE HEARD THAT IT'S

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.731 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:00:36.496 --> 02:00:40.266 region:rollup2
THESE ENTITIES OF THAT THAT

02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:42.569 region:rollup2
COORDINATION HAS STARTED OUT WE

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:44.804 region:rollup2
ALSO HEARD A MULTIPLE TIMES HOW

02:00:42.569 --> 02:00:45.638 region:rollup2
POOR AND GRANTS WHERE VERSUS

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:47.207 region:rollup2
CONTRACT.

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:48.441 region:rollup2
YOU ALL DID MANAGE TO COORDINATE

02:00:47.207 --> 02:00:51.511 region:rollup2
THAT MESSAGE WELL THIS IS THE

02:00:48.441 --> 02:00:53.279 region:rollup2
LAND THAT HE AS WELL AS AT IN

02:00:51.511 --> 02:00:54.347 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.981 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT --

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:56.850 region:rollup2
IS AN INVESTMENT THAT GOES INTO

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:58.918 region:rollup2
--

02:00:56.850 --> 02:01:00.820 region:rollup2
EXISTING EFFORTS THAT HAVE A

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:01.621 region:rollup2
PROVEN TRACK RECORD --

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:04.724 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:05.892 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WE ALSO KNOW THAT AT

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:07.761 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF

02:01:05.892 --> 02:01:09.429 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE HARD TO

02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:11.297 region:rollup2
REACH IN THOSE AREAS I'M INCLUDE

02:01:09.429 --> 02:01:13.066 region:rollup2

FIRE STRICKEN AREAS --

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:19.606 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE

02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:20.774 region:rollup2
MESSAGE ALONG WITH THE MULTITUDE

02:01:19.606 --> 02:01:22.375 region:rollup2
