A CHANCE TO PRESENT THEIR PROPOSALS. WE FIND THAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MANY PROPOSALS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO SOMEONE ARE MERITORIOUS THE COMPELLING OTHER WORTHY OF OUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. ALL OF THEM SEEK TO ADDRESS CRITICAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT OUR STATE FACES. I'M ONLY SORRY THAT WE CAN'T APPROVED THE FUNDS FOR ALL OF THEM. IN FACT WHILE THE ECONOMY IN THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION ARE BOTH STRONG. THERE ARE MANY LIMITATIONS ON STATE SPENDING. MOREOVER WHILE PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE MAYBE OUR COLLECTIVE HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. HAVE HAVE TO BALANCE THE STATE'S HEALTH NEEDS WITH MANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICY AREAS. SUCH AS EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE TRANSPORTATION CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND OTHERS. GIVEN THESE CONSTRAINTS AND GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN HEALTH IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE A FEW KEY ADDITIONS TO OUR HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGETS. I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND COOPERATION WITH TODAY'S HEARING AND IN ORDER TO NOT BE HERE. ALL NIGHT I DO ASK THAT WOULD FOLLOW JUST A FEW RULES. FOR THE MEMBER AND STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS EACH PROPOSAL MAY HAVE ONE SPEAKER OR PRESENTER. AND THAT PERSON MAY HAVE TWO MINUTES.

SUPPORT OF FELLOW CAUGHT THIS FROM THE COMMITTEE FROM BIG BEAR BALDWIN PARK IN SANTA ROSA -- ALONG WITH SEVENTEEN OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO SUPPORT A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME BUDGET REQUEST TO FIND ALZHEIMER'S OUR REACH AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS. TODAY TWENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING WITH OR CARING FOR A LOVED ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S. IT'S A TOP CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG WOMEN IN OUR STATE AND THE DISEASE HITS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HARDEST. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS HAVE HIGHER PROVIDE PREVALENCE HIGHER COST AND IF THEY ARE DIAGNOSED IT'S MUCH LATER IN THE DISEASE PROCESS. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT ANOTHER BUDGET CYCLE TO DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE SUFFERING IN SILENCE. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE TACKLED ALZHEIMER'S AT THE BACK END WHERE THE COSTS ARE THE HIGHEST HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOMS AND NURSING HOMES. AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS BEST WE CANNOT SUSTAIN THIS TODAY. AND WE CERTAINLY CANNOT THE STANDING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHEN WE WILL SEE A 25% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WITH ALZHEIMER'S. OUR STATE HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LEAD THE NATION TO SHOW THE WAY FORWARD. TOGETHER WE CAN INVEST IN THE HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE AND BEGIN SHIFTING RESOURCES AND OUR MINDSET FROM THE BACK INTO THE FRONT END OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THIS BUDGET REQUEST WILL ALLOW US TO CREATE A STATEWIDE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TARGETS OUT REACH TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOCUS ATTENTION ON EARLY DETECTION AND PARTNER WITH COUNTIES AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS ON LOCAL SOLUTIONS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO JOIN IN SUPPORTING THIS TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME BUDGET ASK. THANK YOU MISLI MON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. ANY QUESTIONS FOR MS Là MON. VETERANS.

ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT A NOT A QUESTION I JUST WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD RIGHT INTO THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL -- THE POTENTIAL FOR OF A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE -- FOR BETTER LINKAGE OF TREATMENT -- ESPECIALLY EARLY ON IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL I'M HUGE SUPPORTER AND I I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR BEING A CO AUTHOR MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU MISLIM ON MR ALMOST WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A REQUEST FOR A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. ON PENN STATE HOSPITALS GROUNDS -- IN OUR AREA WHICH I KNOW -- THE CHAIRS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD UTILIZE CURRENTLY UNUSED AREAS AT THE STATE HOSPITALS GROUNDS TO DEVELOP A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT FOR THE WHOLE REGION. CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IN REDUCING THE USE OF RESOURCES ON INCARCERATION AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND DIVERTING THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS MORE EFFECTIVE STABILIZATION. WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE CRISIS WOULD OTHERWISE BE BROUGHT TO A JAIL OR A HOSPITAL? FACILITIES OF THIS KIND PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH A FURTHER TOOL ALLOWING THEM TO GET BACK ON THE STREET AND BACK ON JUST KEEP IN OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. THE EXISTING LAND IN INFRASTRUCTURE -- RESOURCES THAT THIS FACILITY FACILITY PROVIDES WILL EXPAND AN ALREADY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM BEYOND ITS EXISTING FACILITIES IN THE COUNTING TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. BEFORE LEAVING THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WERE ABLE TO GET A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT OUT IN THE JOSHUA TREE AREA AND CEREMONIAL COUNTY. WE SEEN THE THE AFFECTS OF HOW THAT CAME FORWARD AND HELPED WITH DESTABILIZING THE SITUATION. RATHER THAN HAVING INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TO GO TO A COUNTY JAIL OR EMERGENCY ROOM THE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS SERVED THERE IN JOSHUA TREE WOULD TWELVE BEDS. KEPT PEOPLE TO GIVEN THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IT. THESE ARE BIG AT THE BIG THINGS THAT START TO LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH PICTURE THAT'S OUT THERE. THIS TODAY WITH THE PRESENTATION BEFORE YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IS -- FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE OF CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS DO WORK. ALTHOUGH SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT THEIR COSTLY IN THE BEGINNING I WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. LIKE YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER ROSS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THAT AYE RECOMMENDATION. SINCE THIS IS. BILL. IS THE ONLY IT ITEM ON IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. I WILL ALLOW PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME. MA'AM CHAIR MEMBERS GO WITH HIS IDEA WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS SOMEWHERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR MISTER MATHIS GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A REQUEST BEFORE YOU. WHICH WOULD FURTHER FUND HAD THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PARTNERSHIP THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN THROUGH THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WAS CREATED AS A HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM. DESIGNED TO REDUCE UNDERAGE DRINKING AND DRIVING. AND TO PROMOTE A TEENAGE LIFESTYLE FREE FROM ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS. IT IS THE MISSION OF FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE. TO BUILD POSITIVE AND HEALTHY YOUTH DEVELOPMENT THAT ENGAGE OTHER USE. AS ACTIVE LEADERS AND RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM GREW FROM A PILOT PROGRAM IN THREE COUNTIES. TO A STATEWIDE MOVEMENT. THAT AT ITS PEAK. OPERATED IN FIFTY FIVE OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND HAD JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND CHAPTERS. AT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SITES. HOWEVER SINCE THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. HAS SEEN DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS. IN FUNDING. RESULTING IN LESS CAPABILITY TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE. WHEN THEY NEED CONTINUES TO GROW? TODAY THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO OPERATE. IN FIFTY OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WITH JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED CHAPTERS [inaudible] ONE PROGRAM. THAT WAS DECIMATED. WITH THE ELIMINATION OF FUNDING. WAS THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE MENTORING PROGRAM. THE FRONT AND I LIVE MENTORING PROGRAM IS A CROSS AGE MENTORING PROGRAM THAT CONNECTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS POSITIVE ROLE MODELS FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PREPARE THEM FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION INTO HIGH SCHOOL. WHAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF ITS ORIGINAL SERVICES? THE BENEFITS OFFERED TO THE STUDENTS SHOULD BE EXPANDED. TO THEIR ORIGINAL LEVELS. PLEASE PROGRAMS HAVE AN EVIDENCE BASED PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF BENEFITING THEIR PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSION WITH REGARD TO REDUCING ABUSE OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO DRUGS. AND VIOLENCE. THIS PROGRAM HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE STAY IN SCHOOL INCREASING SCHOOLS. AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND HELPS FOR MO A SAFE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS [inaudible] AS SUCH. WE SHOULD EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE SYSTEM. IN THE FIFTY COUNTIES BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LOCAL. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS AND I AM REQUESTING SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE PARTNERSHIP. AT THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. WE ARE OFTEN FACED WITH FUNDING REQUEST THAT ADDRESS IMMEDIATE TRAUMA. THIS REQUEST A SINGLE. IS TO INVEST. IN FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE. TO PREVENT TRAUMA FROM HAPPENING. WHERE AREAS THAT IT'S HONESTLY NEEDED THE MáS [inaudible] OUR YOUTH. AS WE KNOW MOST OFTEN GET IN TROUBLE. DURING THOSE LITTLE BITS OF HOURS AFTER SCHOOL BETWEEN WHEN MAMA GET THAT GETS HOME. IN. YOU KNOW THIS THESE PROGRAMS THEY PROVIDE THAT MENTORSHIP. THAT HELPS OUR KIDS NOT GET LOST IN THE WEEDS AS THEY TRANSITION. THAT HELPS THEM. BY GIVING THEM GOOD ROLE MODELS IN BY TEACHING THEM HOW TO BE GOOD ROLE MODELS. MEMBERS ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WORST MATHIS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO ADD TO SUPPORT A BUDGET ASK OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FOR A PILOT PROJECT. TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE THROUGH HE CONSOLE TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA IS FACING A WERE SEEN SHORTEN IT SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WHICH GREATLY DIMINISHES THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE NEEDED ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. IN PARTS OF MY DISTRICT ONE IN FIVE ADULTS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MEET THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PHYSICIANS. ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO ACCESS SPECIALTY CARE PEOPLE MAY HAVE TO TRAVEL OVER A HUNDRED MILES IN MY DISTRICT THAT MIGHT BE AN ADVENTURE. ECON SALTS ARE THE ARE FAR FOR MEDICINE TELEMEDICINE THEY CAN BE USED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE. IN RURAL DISTRICTS LIKE MINE HOWEVER THERE ARE TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO ADOPTING ECON SO SERVICES SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE WORK FLOW DEVELOPMENT NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF THE CONSOLES THE PROPOSED PILOT PROJECT WE GIVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NECESSARY. TO ADOPT ECON SO PROGRESS PROGRAMS THIS PILOT PROJECT WOULD IMPROVE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE THROUGH INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS IN LARGELY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THIS PILOT PILOT PROJECT BUT ALSO ENABLE THE MUCH NEEDED DATA COLLECTION ON THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF USING ECON SOULS IN THESE REGIONS TO ACCESS SPECIALTY CARE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND I'M AND I ASKED ONCE AGAIN FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BUDGET MASK THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SAYING NONE MR RIVAS I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SEE YOU. IN THAT CORNER MADAM CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALSO AS MANY OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW PRIOR TO MY TIME IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY -- I SERVED EIGHT YEARS AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR -- AND I ALSO WORKED AS AN ADJUNCT INSTRUCTOR AT A LOCAL -- A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I WORK FULL TIME AS A STUDENT SUPPORT MANAGER AT A VERY LARGE -- HIGH SCHOOL -- HIGH SCHOOL THAT HAS STUDENT POPULATION BY THREE THOUSAND AND SO MY TIME IS IS A POOR MEASURES VERY REWARDING EXPERIENCE VERY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND IN MY CAPACITY AS A MANAGER I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT DISCIPLINE -- WORKING WITH CHRONICALLY TRUANT STUDENTS. PREPARING OUR SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN AND ALWAYS ALWAYS WORKING TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE OUR SCHOOL CLIMATE A CHANGING CLIMATE AT THAT. IT'S I WORKED WITH -- STUDENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY -- FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS FROM -- CERTAINLY -- FROM THE DIFFERENT -- EDUCATIONAL -- EXPERIENCES AN ACADEMIC -- EXPERIENCES -- AND IT WAS THE STUDENTS IN THE AND THE INTERACTION I HAD WITH THEM THAT HELP ME REALIZE A SCHOOL CLIMATE WAS ABOUT EMPOWERING AND WELCOMING ALL STUDENTS TO CAMPUS. STUDENTS WITH. THE DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS IN NEEDS AND IT WAS ABOUT. PROVIDING THEM WITH SUPPORTS AND INTERVENTIONS.

PRIORITIES ARE ARE ARE ALL ON PRIORITIES UNDER THE LOCAL ON THE CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND SO CERTAINLY -- THIS BILL SIX TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA TERMS OF EDUCATION HEALTH CARE SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO PROVIDE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES -- WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADMINISTER ANNUAL SERVICE TO STUDENTS PARENTS AND TEACHERS. HAVING THIS NON. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA AVAILABLE TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES WILL HELP INFORM THE LOCAL PLANNING PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACTIVITIES.

IN MARCH WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT RECENT MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITY DATA BEFORE THE POLICY COMMITTEE. IN PARTICULAR WE HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH UTILIZATION CONTINUES TO VARY WIDELY BY REESE PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND THAT MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE NOT IMPROVING OVER TIME. IN FACT THESE GROSS INEQUITIES PERSISTENCE BY A FOR ITS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. GIVEN THIS WE ARE URGING THE STATE TO MAKE A CONCRETE INVESTMENT INTO THE REDUCTION OF MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. C. PEN BELIEVES THAT ADDRESSING THESE PERSISTENT INEQUITIES WILL REQUIRE A FOCUSED AND MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. WE MUST INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SYSTEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND WE MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST DOLLARS TO DRIVE THOSE OUTCOMES. WE SURVEYED OVER A DOZEN COUNTIES ABOUT THEIR CHALLENGES WITH MAKING PROGRESS ON MENTAL HEALTH EQUITY. THE TEAMS THAT EMERGE INCLUDED ANY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEED FOR A BETTER DATA TO INFORM DECISION MAKING. AND A LACK OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN SECTORS -- AND A LACK OF STATEWIDE ACCOUNTABILITY. THEREFORE WE ARE SEEKING TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES WITH AN INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FROM THE MHSAA ADMINISTRATION FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTIES. IN REDUCING THE MENTAL HEALTH INEQUITIES AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THIS FUND CURRENTLY HAS OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SURPLUS. OUR PROPOSAL IS FOR FUNDS TO BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE OAC IN CONSULTATION WITH A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE. FOR ALLOCATION TO COUNTIES AND OTHER ENTITIES. PROVIDING COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE STRATEGIES ON DISPARITY REDUCTION. SPECIFICALLY THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED.

I'M HERE TO RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA BUDGET COMMITTEE INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. TO INCREASE THIS IS A LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM TO INCREMENTALLY EXPAND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS BY MARCH FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE IT IS ESTIMATED THIS STATEWIDE EXPANSION WILL RESULT IN A NET SAVINGS OF OVER FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE. THIS IS THE RIVER SYSTEM LIVING WITH HER PROGRAM PROVIDES CRITICAL COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES TO INSTITUTIONAL. TO INSTITUTIONALIZATION FOR ELIGIBLE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES I MEDIC HOW. EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE OLMSTEAD DECISION. BY AT THE UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS A VIOLATION OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT THERE BY ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING. BY ALLOCATING THIS MONEY WE CAN KEEP PACE WITH OUR GROWING AGING POPULATION STATEWIDE THE OVER FOUR THOUSAND ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES ARE CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A SLOT. BECAUSE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PARTICIPANT COST THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A SOON TO BE SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHILE THE AVERAGE COST PROVIDING WAIVER SERVICES AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS. IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS THIS INVESTMENT PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. TO FURTHER ENSURE THIS IS LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM RESULTS COSTUMES THE STATE. THE PROGRAM REQUIRE 60% OF NEW ENROLLMENTS BE RESERVED FOR INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING. INSTITUTIONAL AND MORE COSTLY SETTINGS. THIS BUDGET REQUEST SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF CONSUMER PROVIDER GROUPS THAT SEE THE FULL UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING SIX BEDS. CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. CALIFORNIA'S HIS LIVING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION LEADING EDGE CALIFORNIA AND JUSTICE AN AGING.

I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER COVER FOR YOUR CONTINUED -- EFFORTS IN THIS IN THIS REGARD IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE SEE A BUDGET I REQUEST COME FORWARD THAT ASK FOR MONEY THAT WILL LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT NET SAVINGS FOR US IN THE IN THE FUTURE -- REALLY APPRECIATE THAT NOT ONLY OBVIOUSLY IS IT WILL LEAD TO A NET SAVINGS THE INCREASED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOW BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A SYSTEM LIVING VERSUS -- BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED IN ANOTHER WAY SO -- IT'S FIVE I FULLY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WISH WE COULD TO EXPAND I KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT NEED IT THIS IS A GREAT START AND ONCE AGAIN. LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE SEE SOMEONE COME FOR WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO LET TO TO A SAVINGS BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE -- WHO DO REALLY IN MANY CASES DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE SETTINGS AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH?

QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE. SAYING THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. IT'S RANDALL HAGER HAGER HERE. PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN. YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RENTAL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION -- PRESENTING FOR MISTER MAIENSCHEIN -- THIS IS A BUDGET REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME STATE GENERAL FUND -- IT'S A PROGRAM WITH THE STIPULATION THAT THIS INCREMENT BE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEMORY PAYMENTS FOR PSYCHIATRISTS. THE SAMPLE DATA THAT LONGER PAYMENT AS A TOOL IS A RECRUIT RETAIN MECHANISM THAT REALLY WORKS -- NEXT DECADE WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING FORTY ONE PRESENTS A FEWER PSYCHIATRISTS. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TRAIN THEM DESPITE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS IN THE TRAINING SYSTEM. WE NEED -- TO TO FACE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF AGING OF PSYCHIATRISTS -- INCREASING POPULATION RISING DEMAND FOR PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ALL KIND OF MIX. AND WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO PRACTICE IN OUR PUBLIC COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IT'S JUST NOT AFFECT ON THE IT'S JUST A FACT. SO AGAIN SEIZE RISING COSTS AS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A VERY ROBUST INCENTIVE TO GET PSYCHIATRIST NOT ONLY INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS USING THE ROBUST CONDITIONS OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX PAPER REPAYMENT PROGRAM. BUT IT WILL ALSO ENCOURAGES -- MEDICAL STUDENTS TO GO INTO PSYCHIATRY AND SIX AND SIX PSYCHIATRIC TREE NEEDS TO CONSIDER PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY AS A AS A POSSIBLE SUBSPECIALTY. SERVER THESE REASONS WE THINK THIS WILL STRENGTHEN THE SIZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR WORK FOR US AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD SING THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SCARLETT HUGHES. PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. TO NO NO OKAY. YOU KNOW. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RASKIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SCARLET HUE. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATORS. IN COLLABORATION WITH C. SACK SEIU AND THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ASKING THE STATE TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES IN PROVIDING DESPERATELY NEEDED FUNDING. FOR PA PEACHY PC'S BY ALLOCATING SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND ONGOING STATE FUNDING TO AUGMENT NOT SUPPLANT COUNTY FUNDING FOR THESE SERVICES. OUR MEMBERS ARE COUNTY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE APPOINTED BY THE COURTS TO ASSUME ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SEVERE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. WHO'S RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION HAS BEEN REMOVED DESPITE THE VARIOUS MANDATES PUT FORTH IN STATE LAW WE RECEIVED NO DIRECT STATE FUNDING. IN FACT AS NEAR AS WE CAN TELL WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM. THAT DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY DEDICATED STATE FUNDING OUR SERVICES ARE FUNDED THROUGH COUNTY JOURNAL FUNDS AND WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY DEDICATED REALIGNMENT MONEY. COUNTIES ARE SPENDING A HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE SERVICES AND STILL OUR MEMBERS ARE STRUGGLING TO MANAGE OVERWHELMING CASELOADS. UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO TURN DOWN CASES OUT WILL. AS THE COURT OFTEN DICTATES WHEN WE MUST ACT BASED ON RECENT LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE TARGET POPULATIONS WE SERVE HAVE GROWN APPROXIMATELY 30% IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THIS 30% INCREASE OF CASES IS DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE LAWS AND POLICIES WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC RISE IN REFERRALS. AND IT INCREASE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASES WE RECEIVE. THESE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES INCLUDE THE OMNIBUS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND RECENT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THE PENAL CODE SECTION. THIRTEEN SEVENTY AS THE LEGISLATURE DEBATES FURTHER REFORMS IN POLICIES TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS. SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SEVERELY COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED AND WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEVERE PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL ABUSE THE NEED FOR PHP GPC SERVICES IS CERTAINLY GROWING. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- QUIRK SILVA YOU'RE PRESENTING ON UNDER IT ISSUE NUMBER. SIX ALMOST MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES. YES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ARE ACTUALLY GOOD ALMOST EVENING -- WOMAN MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND I'M OUT ACTUALLY THE SELECT CHAIR OF THE CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY -- SO TODAY PRESENT -- IT THE PROPOSAL THAT I BELIEVE IS ONE OF TYPE OF PROPOSAL THAT WOULD USE MANY COORDINATORS AN ORANGE COUNTY TO TO REALLY ADDRESS WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS A CRISIS. AND WE'VE SEEN. WITH THE POINT IN TIME COUNT SEVEN THOUSAND ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT ARE HOMELESS. WE'VE SEEN OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIE ON THE STREETS OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE'VE BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE DAVID CARTER CARTER WHO HAS STEPPED UP IN ORANGE COUNTY AND DONE WHAT OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN BOLD ENOUGH TO DO WHICH IS BRING CITIES TO THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY -- NOT ONLY PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SHELTERS LOOK TOWARDS A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE PERMANENT SORT PORT OF HOUSING. BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THERE IS. A MAJOR -- NEED TO LOOK AT USING DATA AND YOU LOOK AT COORDINATION SO WITH THIS I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A REQUEST FOR SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION. TO ESTABLISH THE ORANGE COUNTY CRISIS RESPONSE NETWORK THAT PARTNERS WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE STAR COUNTY SUPERVISORS WHICH WE ARE GLAD THAT THEY ARE AT THE TABLE. AND WARNING TO WORK ON THIS CAL OPTIMO WHICH IS OUR LARGEST -- MEDICAL -- PROVIDER FOR OUR MOST AT NEED MINDO SEE WHICH IS A COLLABORATION OF ALMOST A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE SAID THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND THE ORANGE COUNTY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHICH WOULD CREATE A REGIONAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOCUSED ON DIVERSION. EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION FOR AS I SAID ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND ORANGE COUNTY HOMELESS. AND THOUSANDS WHO ARE NEAR RISK OF FALLING ONTO THE STREETS HAN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW -- WE AND HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE. MANY ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM. BEING HOMELESS AND THOSE ARE TYPICALLY SINGLE MOTHERS WITH. CHILDREN. THIS SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST WOULD RATE DOWN INTO THIS METHOD NUMBER. ONE ESTABLISH A REGIONAL NAVIGATION AND CALL CENTER WITH INTEGRATED DATA MANAGEMENT. NOW WE KNOW THROUGHOUT COUNTIES AND THROUGHOUT MANY SYSTEMS WHERE THEY ARE HOSPITALS OR PUBLIC SAFETY EVEN SCHOOLS THEY ALL HAVE DATA BUT THEY'RE NOT SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS -- IN ON PUBLIC SAFETY A CALL FOR SOMEONE THAT NEEDS SERVICES FIVE OR SIX CALLS MAY HAVE TO BE MADE TO FIND THE RIGHT PROVIDER OR TO FIND EVEN IF THERE IS A BIT BAD. SO REALLY FOCUSING ON HAVE A NAVIGATION SET CENTER THAT IS OPERATING -- BE ON REGULAR WORK HOURS THAT WOULD BE -- WHAT TIMES THAT WE KNOW THAT -- MANY OF OUR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ACTUALLY CALLING WHICH IS AFTER HOURS EARLY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND SOMETIMES THROUGH THE MIDNIGHT HOURS. A HIRD PARTY BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM HEALTH ASSESSMENT ASSISTANT PROGRAM SO AGAIN WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY AND OUR MHS FUNDS BUT ALSO OTHERS THAT CAN GET OUT. TO WHERE WE KNOW HOMELESS. PEOPLE ARE AT SOMETIMES PUBLIC LIBRARY SOMETIMES PARKS SOMETIMES IT IN HIDDEN PLACES WHETHER THEY BE AN INDUSTRIAL AREAS OTHER PLACES SO THAT -- THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME PLACE TO STAY WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO BE MOVED TO MOVE ALONG. AND THEN AGAIN -- WORKING ON THE TWO ONE ONE PROGRAM THAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED TO MAKE IT -- NOT ONLY A CONNECTION BUT SO THAT THERE IS A PLACE THAT -- THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO -- TO SO THIS TYPE OF PROJECT IS I I DON'T THINK IT'S UNIQUE THERE'S MANY MANY GOOD PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS THIS IS ACHIEVABLE IN THIS SENSE OF WE KNOW THAT WE NEED ABOUT -- THREE THOUSAND NEW TYPES OF HOUSING AND BEING ABLE TO GET THEM IN THE PIPELINE BEING ABLE TO GET TO THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- READY FOR THAT TYPE OF HOUSING THIS WOULD BE A TWO YEAR PROGRAM. AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MS QUIRK SILVA QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR PRESENTATION CLEARLY IS VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. THE COORDINATION THE NAVIGATION -- OFTENTIMES THE MONEY IS GIVEN BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN ISSUE IN HOMELESSNESS -- LOTS OF MONEY IS BEING GIVEN FOR THE ISSUE BUT IF WE DON'T COORDINATE. ALL THE SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO HELP. I THINK SOMETIMES THE MONEY IS NOT USED IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I WOULD JUST ADD JUST THERE'S ALSO FROM A LOT OF DUPLICATION WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DRILL DOWN AND TRY. TO LOOK AT WHERE WE CAN ELIMINATE AND SAVE MONEY AND I THINK IT IS THAT COORDINATION THAT HAS TO BE DONE WHEN A PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE USED. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU GALLAGHER. UNDER ISSUES ISSUE NUMBER. SIX TAYLOR EIGHTY H. C.

IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE THE CAMPFIRE RECOVERY PROCESS. TAYLOR CURRENTLY SIR IS FIFTY FOUR VULNERABLE AT RISK ADULTS WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS. HOWEVER WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE IS IMPACTED. OVER THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR THERE'S BEEN A 45% INCREASE IN REFERRALS TO THE CENTER. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE HIGH RISK POPULATION AND THE DISASTER WILL HAVE SERIOUS IMPACTS ON THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING SUCH AS A LOSS. OF ESTABLISHED HEALTH CARE ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASED MEDICAL ISSUES. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE FIFTY NEW PARTICIPANTS ACCESS TO THE CENTER.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR TOBY EWING ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSE SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION -- RECOGNIZING THAT OUR I'LL BE VERY BRIEF -- THE COMMISSION IS ASKING -- FOR THE FUNDING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF PROPOSALS THAT ARE VERY WELL OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THAT MY COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE MEETING IN TERMS OF THE TWO MEMBER PROPOSALS THAT WERE PRESENTED. THE COMMISSION IS SEEKING TO MILLION DOLLARS WITH STAFF TO SUPPORT OUR DATA AN OUTCOME REPORTING WORK AGAIN THAT'S TO EXTEND THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE. OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TELL TO THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS A LOT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT COMPONENT OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS OF THE DOLLARS AND OTHER ANY OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE FUNDED WITH THOSE DOLLARS. CONSISTENT WITH THAT WE'RE SEEKING FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO FACILITATE HOW COUNTIES INVEST THEIR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN INNOVATION FUNDING THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. WERE -- ASKING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR ABILITY AGAIN TO HELP ENGAGE THE COUNTIES AND CONNECT THEM WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON TOPICS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR DATA AND ANALYSIS. AND FUNDING TO SUPPORT WE CALL FISCAL INCENTIVE DOLLARS WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR HERE IS -- TO REPLACE FUNDS THAT WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE TRIAGE FUNDING PROGRAM LAST YEAR. AND TO ALSO TO TO REPLACE THAT MONEY TO MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE CURRENTLY UNDER THAT PROGRAM DOLLARS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES. LIMITED DEFINING PERSON NOW AND FOCUS ON CRISIS AND WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT IT'S IN THE STATE'S INTEREST TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO AMONG OTHER THINGS FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE SCHOOLMENTAL HEALTH. OR IN SOME INSTANCES AS CAME UP TODAY MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH POST PARTUM EPRESSION A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD OUR ISSUES THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD LIKE. TO INVEST IN IN SUPPORTING COUNTIES IMPROVING THOSE PROGRAMS. WE SEE THOSE FOR INVESTMENTS AS PART OF A PACKAGE WHERE WHERE AGAIN LINKING OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. TO OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE COUNTIES IN IMPROVING THAT SYSTEM OVER TIME. HAPPY TO STOP THERE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR MOVE ON TO THE SECOND SET OF PROPOSALS ON THE AGENDA. AT YOUR DIRECTION. MOVE ON TO THE TO THE SECOND SET THANK LESS AND LESS AND PART OF FINANCE REALLY WANTS TO COMMENT ON THIS PART. OKAY. THANK YOU THE SECOND SET OF PROPOSALS SO -- LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION RECEIVED SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET TO SUPPORT ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER INVESTMENT THE STATE HAS MADE AROUND ADVOCACY WE MAKE THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STATEWIDE ON ISSUES OF PRIMARY CONCERN TO THESE POPULATIONS. THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR VETERANS REDUCING THE HEALTH DISPARITIES NO HEALTH CONSUMERS CHILDREN TRANSITION H. YOUTH AND OTHERS. THIS YEAR AS WE WENT OUT AND LISTEN ACROSS THE STATE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS IT BECAME VERY APPARENT. THAT THE NEEDS ARE TREMENDOUS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE NEAR OUR BORDER AND AND AND AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'VE MADE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO FIVE ORGANIZATIONS ONE REPRESENTING EACH REGION OF THE STATE. BUT THAT THE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WE PROBABLY HAD THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE COME AND TALK TO THE COMMISSION ABOUT TREMENDOUS UNMET NEEDS. BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE AND RECOGNIZING THE CULTURAL -- DIVERSITY AMONG THE IMMIGRANT REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO WE CAN AND STANDING STAND THOSE DOLLARS TO MORE ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS WORK AND SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE STATE LEVEL SUPPORT. FOR THOSE EFFORTS. I ITEM BE AN ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT EARLY PSYCHOSIS FUNDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO THE COUNTIES. THAT'S A PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO PUT THOSE FUNDS INTO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION LAUNCHED AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM UNDER THE UNDER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. AND WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT EITHER SHIFT THOSE DOLLARS INTO THE PROGRAM THAT THE COMMISSION HAS LAUNCHED OR SHIFT. THAT WOULD BE OUR IDEAL ASK BUT IF THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE'S NOT INTERESTED IN THAT THAN TO SHIFT THE PROGRAM TO THE HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE STATE TO HAVE A PROGRAM AT THE COMMISSION THAT DESIGNED FUNDED ON A PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE AND FINDING IT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITHOUT A PROGRAM. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LIMITED RESOURCES AND AND ENGAGE UCSF UC SAN FRANCISCO YOU SEE -- LA AND UC DAVIS TO CREATE A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE AROUND EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE A LIMITED NUMBER OF STATE DOLLARS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO BRING TOGETHER ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION OF COUNTY FUNDS AN ADDITIONAL MILLION AND A HALF OF PHILANTHROPY AND ARE WORKING TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL MONEY. OUR ASK IS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BE INVESTED IN THAT EXISTING PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING EARLY PSYCHOSIS CARE AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. OUR THIRD REQUEST IS ABOUT SIX AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO DO THE WORK THAT WE WERE DIRECTED TO DO UNDER SB TEN OH FOUR WHICH IS TO PUT TOGETHER A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE AROUND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. SO AGAIN THE ANALYSIS RIGHT TO THE VERY NICELY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. SPRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I KNOW THE TO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT IS ACCESS. TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE WAIT TIME -- IN COLLECTING DATA -- AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT BEGINNING IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU WITH -- FINDING OUT BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ABSOLUTELY SO THE COMMISSION HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER INNOVATION PROGRAMS AND P. E. I. FIND PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION FUNDED PROGRAMS. AS PART OF THAT EFFORT WE'VE REQUIRED EVERY PROGRAM TO REPORT TO THE STATE DETAILED INFORMATION ON WHO IS SERVED BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE SPOKEN VETERAN STATUS DISABILITY STATUS WE'VE ALSO REQUIRED A REPORT ON SOMETHING CALLED THE DURATION OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE PAST AND THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY THERE BUT HOW WE WOULD MEASURE THAT. THE COMMISSION'S ARGUMENT IS THAT WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE EVEN IF THE DATA ARE NEW AND AND AS THAT AND THAT'S SERVICE OF THE QUALITY OF THAT DATA EMERGES. WE HAVE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE BUILT A WEBSITE. THAT ALLOWS ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS INFORMATION ON ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED M. TO SAY FUNDED PROGRAMS OVER TIME AS COUNTY SUBMIT INFORMATION ON WHO THEY ACTUALLY SERVE. INCLUDING TIME TO SERVICE WILL ADD THAT INFORMATION INTO THAT WEBSITE OUR INTENT IS AS WE SUPPORT A COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS. ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEDIA POLICYMAKERS HERE IN THE CAPITAL CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE. WHO WAS ACTUALLY BEING SERVED AND THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE SEEING INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE IN TIME TO CARE SO THIS IS THIS IS REALLY AN? EMERGING STRATEGY WE'VE WE'VE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THAT THIS FULL PROPOSAL IN THE INCLUDING THAT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS MORE DATA TO LINK DATA TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE IS SO WE CAN EXPAND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. THE LAW PRIORITIZES REDUCING SCHOOL FAILURE REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT REDUCING HOMELESSNESS SO WE'RE WORKING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU AND THE PUBLIC THAT INFORMATION ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS. IT'S NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO SAY MY LOVED ONE VISITED THIS PROGRAM AND THEY GOT THIS INDIVIDUAL OUTCOME IT'S INTENDED TO HAVE TO FACILITATE A DISCUSSION WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. SO THAT SUPER BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN ENGAGE AROUND ARE THE DOLLARS BEING WELL SPENT. ARE THEY PRIORITIZED IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. ARE WE CREATING MORE DISPARITIES OR REDUCING DISPARITIES THUS THE THE NEED FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WE TALKED ABOUT. THEIR NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THERE THE DEMOGRAPHIC REPORTING ONLY APPLIES TO P. E. I. INNOVATION PROGRAMS. THE REST OF THE PROGRAM'S FALL INTO THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT AND WE'RE WORKING AND URGING THE DEPARTMENT TO ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT ARE PARALLEL TO WHAT THE COMMISSION HAS IN PLACE. AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN TELL YOU A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE. OF WHO IS BEING SERVED ACCESS TO CARE AND THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED. IF YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY AND ACCESS TO CARE. ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES. FOR THERE'S SOMEONE WITH. MENTAL ISSUES ARE REQUIRING MENTAL HEALTH. TREATMENT. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR THAT PERSON TO BE SEEN OR TO BE REFERRED TO THE THE NEXT APPOINTMENT TO TO BE SEEN. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE REVIEWED IN THIS STUDY -- THE AS AS IT IS PROPOSED NOW THE INTENT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE OUTCOMES SO THAT WE CAN THEN INVEST MORE EVALUATION BECAUSE THE FOCUS OUR RESEARCH AND EVALUATION DOLLARS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE. THE SCALE OF THAT PROBLEM IS BEYOND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE ASKING FOR TODAY THE RESOURCE ADDRESSING FOR TODAY -- REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK IN TERMS OF THOSE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE WE RECENTLY RELEASED INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE AND FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE DATA ARE SUGGESTING THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THAT PROGRAM. IN RESPONSE WE'RE BRINGING TOGETHER ABOUT FIFTEEN COUNTIES TO LOOK AT THEIR INDIVIDUAL DATA AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENTED ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THAT. WOULD BE THINGS LIKE -- DELAYS IN ACCESSING CARE BUT IT IT'S THE REASON IT'S CHALLENGING IS BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND SOME ODD PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE ALL VERY DIFFERENT IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO LOOK AT THAT STATEWIDE. IT'S THE INTENT OF UNDERSTANDING WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND THEN BEING ABLE TO DRILL DOWN IT ISSUES SUCH AS ACCESS AND TIME TO ACCESS. I I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE IT IS AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP OFTEN IN DISCUSSIONS -- THIS ACCESS OR LACK OF ACCESS TIMELY ACCESS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS -- OR WIND EVEN WHEN IT'S DEPRESSION DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A CRISIS SO THIS PERIOD OF TIME FROM WHEN THEY COME IN TO REQUEST TREATMENT AND THE TIME THEY ACTUALLY GET THE REFERRAL ACTUALLY GET THE TREATMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH. A QUICK BEFORE YOU LEAVE. LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE.

EIGHT CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY WELCOME. AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE READY READING IS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. MY NAME IS FRANK MORE AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CHAPTER. AND WITH ME I HAVE CAROLINE AND WHICH ARE A WHO IS OUR GET THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- WE'VE PRESENTED THIS ITEM IN MARCH -- INITIALLY -- WE PRESENT BACKGROUND ON OUR CHILDREN IN USE -- GRANT PROGRAM ANY APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAD RECEIVED FOR THAT PROGRAM -- FOR YOUR REQUEST THE STAFF WE PULLED ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SEE WHY THEY DIDN'T THOSE IT DIDN'T APPLY. DO NOT APPLY AND RECEIVE BACK A RESPONDENTS RATE RATE OF ABOUT RESPONDED TO OUR POLL. ALMOST HALF OF THOSE RESPONDENTS SAID THAT THE SHORT APPLICATION PERIOD WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING. A 60% SAID THAT THE SHORT TIME LINE TO EXPAND FUNDS WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING TO OUR PROGRAM. AND ALMOST 70% SAID THAT LACK OF GRANT WRITING STAFF ON HAND WAS AN IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING FOR OUR A GRANT PROGRAM -- SO WE BELIEVE THAT THESE IMPEDIMENTS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY ALIGNING AND EXTENDING THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION 30% OF THE RESPONDENTS SAID THAT LACK OF FLEXIBILITY -- WAS A IMPEDIMENT TO APPLYING SO WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDING EXPLICIT BUDGET LANGUAGE ALLOWING US. TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR ANY OF THE FOR INTENDED USE IS -- FOR THIS PROGRAM -- THE TREASURE CAME BEFORE YOU LAST MONTH PRESENTED SOME CONCEPTS -- AND WE HAVE PUT THOSE CONCEPTS INTO BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU ON PAGE.

DO YOU MEAN THE A LACK OF THE GRANT WRITING. YES IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE -- IT'S NOT JUST THE SMALL COUNTIES AND ALSO THE LARGE COUNTIES THERE ARE SO MANY PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT -- IN THE LARGE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE STAFF ON HAND -- TO APPLYING FOR SPECIALLY FOR THE SMALLER PROGRAMS WAS TRIPPING ON THE IT'S WORTH THEIR WHILE THIS I'D CONSIDERS TO BE ONE OF THE SMALLER PROGRAMS [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M RELATED THAT WHEN WE WORKED ON THE THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- THE FOR THE FOR THE WILD FIRES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IS THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THAT CASE IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE AREAS. THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE WILD FIRES. AND OFTENTIMES WE ASKING PEOPLE TO APPLY BUT WE DO HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND FINDING WAYS. TO TO PROVIDE MORE THAN JUST A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT TOTO REALLY HELP THEM.

HOW TO APPLY IT HOW IMPORTANT THESE THESE -- THESE APPLICATIONS ARE. RESPONDING TO THE OUR PEACE. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AT SOME POINT IT'S JUST THAT IT WAS SO CLEAR DURING OUR CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THAT IT WAS. WE NEED TO FIND A BETTER WAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY WENT TO THOSE WHO MOST NEEDED IT NOT THOSE WHO KNEW HOW TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS. FIND THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM NOT JUST HERE BUT IN SO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS GREEN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. BRINGSUS TO ISSUE NUMBER. NINE TO ME THE CLINIC VISION INTEGRATION PROJECT. THE CALIFORNIA UP TO METRIC ASSOCIATION. THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN READ NO SO SEE IT'S REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATION.

PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER -- NINE GOOD AFTERNOON VICTOR CHRISTY WITH CALIFORNIA HELP WITH ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND WHEN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE CLINIC VISION INTEGRATION PROJECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER. NINE VERY GOOD SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. TEN CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS EXCHANGE COVERED TO CALIFORNIA. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AM J. D. AS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. PLEASE TO SUPPORT OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUEST FOR COVER CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY ON THIS SINGLE PREMIUM INVOICE AND BRONZE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS. ON THE SINGLE PREMIUM INVOICE PROPOSAL THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES COVERAGE A FULL RANGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. BUT A PENDING FEDERAL RULE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO COMPLY WITH AND THE FEDERAL RULE. THE RULE WOULD REQUIRE INSURERS TO SAND AND CONSUMERS TO PAY TWO ENTIRELY SEPARATE BILLS FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM. ADDITIONALLY THIS PURPOSE THIS PROPOSED RULE CHANGE WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO COMPLY WITH BOTH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AND ALSO THE PENDING FEDERAL RULE WE ARE PROPOSING LANGUAGE THAT SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT A CONSUMER RECEIVED ONLY ONE INVOICE AND SUBMITS ONE PAYMENT. ON THE BRONZE H. D. H. P. OR HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN FOR YOUR VALUE THIS ISSUE CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF ADVOCATES HEALTH PLANS. INSURERS AND COVERED CALIFORNIA DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARD BENEFIT DESIGN PRODUCTS IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR PLAN YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WHICH OPEN ENROLLMENT STARTS THIS OCTOBER. TWENTY NINETEEN THE IRS RULES FOR SIX SETTING THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMIT OR MOVE. IS LOWER FOR BRONZE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS THEN THE RULES FOR THE MOVED FOR OTHER EXCHANGE MEADOW HEALTH PLANS. TO MEET THE IRS RULES FOR THESE PRODUCTS THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO CHANGE STATE LAW IN ORDER FOR THE CONTINUED OFFERING OF SIXTY TWO POINT 2%. AB BRONZE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS IN THE MARKET. THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH THIS TYPE OF COVERAGE BECAUSE THE RULES APPLY ON AND OFF EXCHANGE AND TO BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS. THIS NARROW FIX IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF COVERAGE. IF THE LAW IS NOT UPDATED THEN NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL BE FORCED TO CHOOSE AN ALTERNATIVE COVERAGE. FOR BOTH ISSUES WE SEEK TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT IS NURTURED URGENT ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE IN EFFECT BY JULY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN SO THAT PLANS AND INSURERS ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT PRODUCTS. FOR REVIEW THIS JULY TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PLAN RATE YEAR FOR THESE REASONS WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER ALI WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND WE SPOKE WE SUPPORT BOTH OF THE PROPOSALS -- FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA TO ALLOW -- FOR EASE OF ADMINISTRATION FOR ONE INVOICE AND WANT PROCESSING OF ONE PREMIUM PAYMENT -- ON THE FIRST PROPOSAL THAN THIS THE SECOND PROPOSALS WE AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT THE JUST NEEDS TO BE MADE -- FOR THE MOVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ALSO SUPPORT BOTH THAT PROPOSALS ON THAT THE SINGLE PREMIUM INVOICE. AS WELL AS THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN ACTUARIAL VALUE ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT BIG FANS OF BRONZE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS THIS PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED FIX -- FOR OVER A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS THE SUPPORTER OPPOSE. WHERE WHERE IN SUPPORT THIS IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE? I'M KIDDING. YOU WERE CLEAR YOU WERE VERY CLEAR. IT'S JUST LATE. YES SIR GOOD EVENING FELIX THE WITH BLUE SHIELD CALIFORNIA. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE DIDN'T SUBMIT A FORMAL LETTER POSITION BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH PROPOSALS JUST DISCUSSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ERIN FOX LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER IN SUPPORT OF BOLD PROPOSALS THANK YOU THANK. AMANDA MCALLISTER WONDER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA LGBT Q. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF BOTH PROPOSALS. THANK YOU. DANIELLE MAILLET CALIFORNIA LINES A CHILD FAMILY SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF SINGLE PREMIUM INVOICES. THANK YOU. AND ONLY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA HEPATITIS ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH PROPOSALS AND WE ECHO THE CONCERNS ABOUT BRONZE PLANS. YOU GOT THE MESSAGE DUE TO ALL RIGHT. BUT I BET YOU THOSE QUARTER MILLION. WILL ARE HAPPY THEY HAVE AT LEAST THE BRONZE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN ARE SPREAD. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS SOCIAIS XIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MAYOR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE TODAY TO REQUEST AN AUGMENTATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE SONG AROUND PROGRAM AT THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. C. CJ'S RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF THIS APPROPRIATION BE INCREASED TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THAT AT LEAST THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT BE SET ASIDE. FOR PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. AND THE SONG GRANT PROGRAM PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING FUNDED EQUITABLY COMPARE TO OTHER TYPES OF PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THIRDS DUE TO A CHANGE TO THE ALLOCATION CRITERIA FROM. TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS RECEIVED OVER 30% OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE BUT IN THE MOST RECENT TWO ALLOCATIONS AT A TIME WHEN THE FUNDING HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE NOW RECEIVING LESS THAN 4% OF THE FUNDING I HAVE SEEN NO ACTUAL GAINS IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING. WE'RE SEEKING TO ADDRESS THIS BY ASKING THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE TO SET A SIDE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE SONG BROWN FUNDING GOING FORWARD AFTER DOCTOR DEDUCTING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THE EXTRA TWO MILLION DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED. SO THAT ARE. 10% DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM ANYBODY WHO'S BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGES TO THE ALLOCATION FORMULA -- BUT I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY MENTIONING TWO REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY DO INVEST IN PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY IS AS A STATE. FIRST PEDIATRICIANS RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TRAINING TIME AND HOURS WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND ACUTE CARE SETTINGS WHICH MEANS THEY CAN HANDLE A LOT MORE ISSUES WITHOUT HAVING TO RETURN REFER THOSE CHILDREN NOT TO SPECIALISTS. SO ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY PROVIDE A VALUE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM. SECONDLY PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS FEDERAL FUNDING THAN OTHER TYPES OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE DON'T SERVE ANY MONEY ON MEDICARE. MEDICARE FUNDS RESIDENCY SLOT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SEAT GME FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONLY FUNDS ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A SLOT. THAT LEAVES THE INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE THAT PROGRAM AND THE STATE'S TO BACK FILL THAT AND SO IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE CONTINUE. THAT COMMITMENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE HOPE YOU INCLUDE OUR PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET. THANKS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS -- MADAM CHAIR EXCUSE US IT IS LATE WE JUMPED THE GUN WORDS WEREN'T UP TO ITEMS FROM NOW. ALL RIGHT. QUESTIONS COMMENTS ON THIS FIRST ITEM [inaudible] YES. PATTERSON. AT THIS ONE UP. IS IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND AN IMPORTANT TO US. CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE A PREMIER BALLOT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING IT BUT I WAS. TAKEN ABACK BY [inaudible] HOW LITTLE? GMAT IT. THESE HOSPITALS ARE RECEIVING. AND SO YOU KNOW WE DUG INTO IT AND LOOKED AT IT AND ASK AS WAS. PRESENT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD. PENSION. INTENTION WAS BUT THE RESULT HAS BEEN THIS ARE HORRIBLE A SHORTFALL IN FUNDING THAT HAS. REALLY UP. TO ME MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL. IS REALLY HAS TO BE SOMETHING OF A HIGH PRIORITY I THINK SO I THINK. IT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST -- MAKES FUNDING FOR THE PEDIATRIC SLOTS DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. IN IT AS WELL SO I HOPE WE ACT POSITIVELY ON THIS WHEN WE MAKE THAT DECISION. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. YES DOCTOR WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF FOR MISTER PATTERSON THERE I THINK IT'S IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK ABOUT ALMOST 60% OF OUR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT MEDI CAL AND AND AND WE KNOW WE ARE FACING -- A PRIMARY CARE SHORTAGE -- PROVIDERS AND ONLY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE REALLY. THINK ABOUT PEDIATRIC CARE AS PRIDE AS PRIMARY CARE BUT IF IT TRULY IS AND AND SO I I THINK YOU FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND I'M. HAPPY TO SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE FUNDING. CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. AUDIBLE CHAIR MEMBER SHEREE DAILY WITH CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OBJECTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE LOST TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX CALIFORNIANS TO OPIOID OVERDOSE. ANOTHER FOUR THOUSAND PRESENTED FOR OPIOID OVERDOSE IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS. IN ADDITION COCAINE AND STIMULANTS DEATHS ARE AGAIN ON THE RISE NATIONWIDE COCAINE DEATHS INCREASED BY 52%. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE LOST TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE AMERICANS TO COCAINE OVERDOSE THIS ALONE. AND CALIFORNIA 8% OF OUR CITIZENS MEET THE CRITERIA FOR NEEDING A CITY SERVICES YET ONLY ONE IN TEN RECEIVE SO SERVICES. A MAJOR IMPACT TO THE ABILITY SERVICES IS THE WORK FORCE. WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY THOUSAND COUNSELORS TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF ADDICTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE IS ZERO DOLLARS AT THIS TIME FROM THE STATE ALLOCATED TO FOR THIS WORKFORCE. WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM. THE I MIGHT JUST SAY WHAT FUNDS. BECAUSE PROP -- SIXTY THREE HAS PARAMETERS THAT ADDICTION COUNSELORS CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THAT. WORK FUNDING. AND THERE'S ALSO REQUIREMENT THAT SHOULD BE LICENSE WITH WHICH THESE COUNSELORS NOT LICENSED IN THE STATE SO THEY CAN'T ACCESS THOSE FUNDS. SO THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS A ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOTMENT AND IT WOULD PROVIDE EDUCAIONAL STIPENDS FROM THE MASTERS LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN. TO THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION LEVEL. IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT PROVIDE A STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO SEE WHERE THE COUNSELORS ARE. WHAT SKILL LEVELS THERE AT? IT WOULD DO A SUNRISE REVIEW TO DETERMINE IF THE CURRENT REGULATORY FORMAT IS WORKING OR IS NOT WORKING. IT WOULD PROVIDE A STATEWIDE MASS TRAINING SO THAT ALL COUNSELORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE KNOW HOW TO USE PRESENT MEDICATIONS THAT ARE SHOWN TO HAVE THAT SEXY. IT WOULD PROVIDE AN LGBT Q. TOOL TO ASSIST ALL PROVIDERS OF ADDICTION TREATMENT THE ABILITY TO SEE IF THERE ORGANIZATIONS ARE OF SHOULD BE TQ AFFIRMING OR NOT AND HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND LASTLY WOULD PROVIDE WAIVERS FOR TEST PREPARATION TEST FEES CERTIFICATION COSTS WHICH CAN AMOUNT TO MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IN MOST CASES BEFORE CERTIFICATION ARE WORKING AS REGISTRANTS? AND MAKING BARELY MINIMUM WAGE SO THESE COSTS ARE INDEED A BARRIER FOR THEM. BECOMING CERTIFIED. I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO ALL OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO ARE FOCUSED ON THE OPIOID CRISIS IS HERE IN PARTICULAR FROM THE DOCTOR WOULD FOR IS. HIS HEARING ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THE WORK FORCE IS AN ISSUE AND AN IMPEDIMENT. TO EXPANDING TREATMENT PROCUREMENT OF USE AND ABUSE OF OTHER DRUGS ASKING POSITIVE CONSIDERATIONS I THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS DR WOOD. JUST JUST TO CLARIFY YOU LAID OUT A VERY AMBITIOUS -- PROGRAM THERE FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- HOW MANY? CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT AND HOPE THE IMPACT THE WORKFORCE WITH THAT THAT WE WERE HOPING THAT SO FOR A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL EDUCATION TO GET CERTIFIED THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN MONTH PROGRAM WE WERE LOOKING INTO. THOUSAND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THAT PROGRAM -- WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK IT'S TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR ALLOTMENT TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THEIR TESTES ARE TAPPED PROTEST PREPPY SNATCHERS CATION FEES. A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU SEE STUDY FOR THE SUNRISE REVIEW ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE REST OF THE MONIES WOULD BE FOR EDUCATION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF HAPPY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

TO MEASURE IT THE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE. AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE AFFECTED. UNFORTUNATELY FUNDING AND LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR THE REGISTRY EXPIRES THIS YEAR. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PARKINSON'S DISEASE CASES.

THOUSANDS OF CASES HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE REGISTRY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR AND THOUSANDS MORE ARE ARRIVING THIS MONTH. AS MEDICAL GROUPS AND HOSPITALS BEGIN TO SUBMIT TEIR PATIENT DATA. SURPRISINGLY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PARKINSON'S DISEASE IS DISTRIBUTED AMONG DIFFERENT POPULATION GROUPS AND WHETHER THE PATTERNS OF DISEASE ARE CHANGING OVER TIME. THIS RESEARCH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FURTHER. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE INCLUDING ASSOCIATED CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS. THIS FUNDING REQUEST IS SIMILAR TO THE FUNDING DPH RECEIVED TED MINISTER ITS CANCER REGISTRY WHICH IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE LEADING CANCER REGISTRIES IN THE WORLD. DUE TO THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION MORE CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT THE OCCURRENCE OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

THIS MODEST ONE TIME ALLOCATION IS BOTH SOCIALLY AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AS IS THIS NEW OFFICE -- THIS OFFICE WILL WORK TO ADVANCE COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE RATHER THAN HARMFUL AND EXPENSIVE MEASURES. SUCH AS INVOLVING THE CRIMINAL LEGAL AND CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE COST SAVINGS COULD BE EXPERIENCED THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY.

IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. WELL OVER HALF OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY TAKES PLACE IN THE BUSY PRIMARY CARE SETTING NOT BY PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST I NEEDED THIS FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE MY PRIMARY CARE TRAINING INCLUDED VERY LITTLE IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. UNFORTUNATELY MOST PRIMARY CARE TRAINING PROGRAMS TO HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED TRAINING AND PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY. THIS TRAINING WAS VERY VALUABLE TO ME. DEPRESSION IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DISABILITY IN ALL AGE GROUPS SUICIDE RATES OF INCREASE BY ABOUT 25% IN THE LAST DECADE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRISTS AND THE SHORTAGES CLEARLY PROJECTED TO GET WORSE PARTICULARLY IN AREAS. LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE FRESNO LOS ANGELES AND RULED. COUNTIES THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN OUR GREAT STATE AND THIS TNT PROGRAM SQUARELY IS ADDRESSING IT. THEY TRAIN PROVIDERS AND TEACH THEM HOW TO TRAIN OTHERS THEIR RESEARCH OUTCOMES ARE IMPRESSIVE. ONE THEY'VE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN PSYCHIATRIC. PSYCHIATRY IN CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT DECREASE MENTAL HEALTH RELATED STIGMA IMPROVED. EARLY RECOGNITION AND DEPRESSION. THEY'VE HELPED EARLY ABBOTT ARE AT EARLY EVIDENCE HAS DECREASED OPIOID PRESCRIPTION AMONG TNT PCP GRADUATES AND INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN TEACHING OTHER PROVIDERS WITHIN THE REGION.

I RECALL IN ONE OF THE EARLIER HEARINGS WE WE TALKED ABOUT. THE LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND STATE HOSPITALS I THINK WHAT FORTY PLUS PERCENT -- VACANCY RATES AND AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT ONCE AGAIN IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS CONTINUES TO HIGHLIGHTS THE HUGE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH WORKFORCE.

YOU'RE GOING TO PICK WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK. GOOD EVENING I'M DOCTOR LANDER CLERK HERBIE THE DIRECTOR POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. TOGETHER WITH OUR CO SPONSORS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST -- WE REQUEST SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WORK FORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TRUST FUND TO FUND ALSO PUTS FIVE YEAR WORK FORCE PLAN. WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE CRISIS IN OUR STATE WE'VE HEARD PLENTY ABOUT IT TONIGHT AND IN IN PRIOR HEARINGS ALL SPORTS PLAN LAYS THE FRAMEWORK TO SOLVING THIS CRISIS BUT THERE'S NO ONGOING FUNDING DEDICATED TO THE PLAN. FUNDING WILL ALLOW FOR STRENGTHENING THE WORK FORCE PIPELINE IT WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR PROFESSIONALS AND IT WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE MEMBERS PROVIDE NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO I'D LIKE TO THINK SENATOR CABALLERO FOR TAPPING THIS BECAUSE SHE ALONG WITH SENATORS HUESO AND GALGIANI AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GLORIA FLORA SALAS WE MON AND RUBIO AND GRAYSON HAVE DROPPED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY CO SPONSOR FROM THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL IS HERE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS REQUEST.

CHAIR AND MEMBERS SALAS HUDDLED ON WHAT THE WIDENING GROUP HERE REPRESENTING NESSIE I USE STATE COUNCIL ON THIS ITEM -- FROM NINETEEN NINETY THREE TWENTY FOURTEEN SCA YOU AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS OBTAIN DATA STATES FROM OFSHE PAD CALLED THE PUBLIC USE FILES WHICH INCLUDED THE IDENTIFIED PATIENT LEVEL DATA FROM HOSPITALS AND AMBULATORY. AMATORY SURGERY CENTERS. THESE DATA FILES WERE THE ONLY COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT LEVEL PRODUCT. PRODUCT THAT ADVOCATES COULD RECEIVE FROM MáS PAD AND HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF SCA USE WORK EXAMINED HEALTH CARE YOU JUST UTILISATION QUALITY AND DISPARITIES. WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE FULL DATA SETS SCA YOU AND OTHER ADVOCATES DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE POLICY MAKING AND REGULATORY PROCESS. WELL SUMMARY DATACURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR MUCH BUT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND GENERAL TRENDS IT IS INSUFFICIENT FOR INVESTIGATING MORE COMPLEX SITUATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. USING THE ARCH BUT PUBLIC USE FILES WE HAVE EXAMINED DISPARITIES MATERNALLY CARE BY PAYER. AND SHOWN THE IMPACT OF COMMUNITIES WHEN HOSPITALS REDUCE OR ELIMINATE CRITICAL LINES OF SERVICE. HOWEVER US PET HASN'T REINTERPRETED WHAT DATA MAYBE PUBLIC YOUR RELEASE UNDER EXISTING STATUTE THIS HAS LED TO SCA YOU ANOTHER ADVOCATES LOSING ACCESS TO THE DATA. CONTAINED IN AUSCHWITZ PUBLIC USE FILES. THE INFORMATION ALL SPECIAL US PET COLLECTS FROM HOSPITALS AND AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS CAN BRING IN A POINT DATA DRIVEN VOICE TO THE CURRENT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EXPANDING. ACCESS TO CRITICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN IDENTIFYING THE NECESSARY HEALTHCARE COSTS DRIVERS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND AN EXISTING DATA ACCESS PROCEDURE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE RELEASE OF SENSITIVE EDUCATION RELATED DATA. TO ALSO ALLOW FOR THE RELEASE OF HEALTH CARE DATA TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW ESTABLISH SECURITY PRACTICES. THIS PROPOSAL BUILT ON THE COMMITMENT TO HEALTHCARE DATA TRANSPARENCY THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE LAST YEAR IN AB. EIGHTEEN TEN THE HELP TRAILER BILL WHICH PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE PATH TOWARD CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS DATABASE HOWEVER THAT EFFORT. WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS AND IN THE INTERIM WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO WRIST RESTORE ADVOCATES ACCESS TO THE DATA CONTENT CONTAINED IN THE ARCH BUT PUBLIC USE FILES THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES DR. QUESTION SO. SO LISTEN YOUR PRESENTATION PRIVACY CONCERNS AS THE REASON FOR THIS NOW FIVE YEAR GAP IN THE ABILITY TO GATHER THIS KIND OF DATA. HAS THERE BEEN NO.

SO THE COURT THERE ARE STAND YET SO THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND THE PRIVACY -- AND THIS NOTED -- YOU KNOW WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO ARE IS RECEIVING THIS DATA. HAS A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE THAT DATA IS NOT GOING TO BE. GOING OUT SO WHERE WAS WORD DOESN'T HAVE TO GO FOR EXAMPLE SCA USE INTERNAL SYSTEM IS HIPPA COMPLIANT IF THE HIPPA COMPLIANT SYSTEM SO THERE ARE CONCERNS I MEAN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER IS RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION. PASS A CERTAIN MEASURE OF COMPLIANCE. SO FOR FIVE YEARS THERE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY WAY TO RESOLVE THIS. THIS IS THE STALEMATE WE'VE HAD IT LIMITED ACCESS. TO THE INFORMATION TO CERTAIN INFORMATION. WHICH IS UP TO ME IS A HUGE IMPEDIMENT TO MAKING PROGRESS IN MANY IN MANY OF THESE AREAS SO -- YEAH AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU MORE INFORMATION HAVE A DEEPER DIVE WITH YOU DOCTOR WOULD OF COURSE WELL I I THINK THAT THE OLD PLAYER ALL PEER TO CLAIMS DATABASE MAY FACE SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE. PRIVACY CHALLENGES AS WELL -- SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES EARLY -- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT WITHOUT THE DATA WE CAN'T WE CAN'T SOLVE A LOT OF THESE REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES SO.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN HERE BEYOND ON BEHALF OF AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AS WELL AS OUR PARTNER -- IN IN THIS -- REQUEST ON SOCAL ACCESS HEALTH I'M NOT GOING TO START WITH THE RECITATION OF ALL THE DATA WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON HOW THIS EPIDEMIC OF STDS HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF CONTROL. BUT I WILL POINT OUT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASE IN POPULATION CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO AS HE DEEP -- GROWTH WE'VE SEEN THIS -- SIX TIMES GROWTH INCLUDE MEDIA SCENE TWENTY FIVE TIMES A GROWTH AND GONORRHEA SCENE TWENTY EIGHT TIMES THE GROWTH AND SYPHILIS WE SEEM FORTY TWO TIMES THE GROWTH IN CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. AND THE WORST MOST TRAGIC OUTCOME OF THE LATTER IS THE FACT THAT WOULD -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THIRTY STILLBIRTHS -- FROM CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IT'S AN EPIC IN EPIDEMIC HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF CONTROL AND IT'S FAR PAST TIME FOR US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT -- WE'RE HERE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO AUGMENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF TWO MILLION ON ON GOING AS TO THE FUNDS. I'M WITH ANOTHER EIGHTEEN MILLION FOR A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL -- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD GIVE MORE DIRECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. ON HOW THOSE FUNDS COULD BE SPENT -- IF YOU LOOK AT CURRENT STATUTE CURRENT STATUTE THE GIVES DIRECTION IS ONE SENTENCE LONG. WE THINK THAT AS FAR IN ADEQUATE TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT ON HOW THEY SHOULD BE SPENDING THIS MONEY AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE DOING IT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY -- LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NEW THERE AND A LOT OF NEW -- WAYS TO TO DEAL WITH THIS EPIDEMIC ON THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED WHEN THAT ONE SENTENCE WAS WRITTEN FIFTY OR SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS AGO -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT -- ONE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE -- TALK -- TO ACTUALLY I'M SORRY THERE WAS SOMETHING I WON SAID BEGINNING YOU SAID LAST WEEK MADAM CHAIR TO L. A. L. ASK THEM TO SEE IF THEY COME WITH SOME ANALYSIS. ON WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM OUT THERE HOW BIG IS THIS WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH WE DID -- SORT OF A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ILLEGITIMATE -- ANALYSIS LAST WEEK WE SPEND ABOUT NINETY FIVE DOLLARS PER PATIENT IT'S HEALTH HEARD FOUNDATION DOES ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST STD PROGRAMS IN THE STATE -- CDC SAYS THERE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW INFECTIONS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY NINETY FIVE WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL TO TRYING TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT GOING TO APPROPRIATE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- BUT WE THINK IT PUTS THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS CLEARLY IN PERSPECTIVE -- WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO ADOPT THE TWENTY MILLION ONGOING FUNDS WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS JUST A COMMENT I MEAN THIS THIS SPIKE IS IS IS ACTUALLY SHOCKING WE DON'T LIVE IN THE EIGHTEENTH OR SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ANYMORE AND AND TO SEE THIS -- THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING IS IS THERE. IS WHAT IS THERE AN EXPLANATION I'M IN MEAN I I REMEMBER AS A STUDENT IN SCHOOL BEING EDUCATED ABOUT THESE THINGS AND AND I THE THE THE INCIDENTS WAS NOT NEARLY WHAT IT IS NOW IS -- MAYBE I'M ASKING THE WRONG PERSON BUT IS PRETTY SHOCKING. YES WELL I DON'T THINK I'M NOT FOR THE WRONG PERSON. OKAY I'M I'M REALLY NOT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS OR OR SAID -- IN THE S. P. D. WORLD I WILL SAY IN TALKING TO A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN GUIDING US ON THIS -- THERE WAS A HUGE EPIDEMIC IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND IT TOOK A MAJOR INFUSION CASH TOWARDS THE END OF THAT -- INTO THAT DECADE I'M AND WE GOT IT DOWN THERE WAS THERE WAS A PLAN THAT -- IN THE NUMBER OF STDS THAT ARE JUST STARTED GOING BACK UP IN IN IN MAJOR WAYS THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF REASONS FOR BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH MONEY ON GOING MONEY. I MEAN BLESSED THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROPRIATING TWO ONE TIME ONLY APPROPRIATIONS THE LAST THREE YEARS FIVE MILLION TWO MEN. THAT WAS HELPFUL BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE ONLY PUTTING OUT ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING CAN ONLY PURCHASE STUFF WITH THE YOU CAN'T BUY ON GOING STAFFING GAUGE WHEN. IT'S JUST NOT DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO -- WE NEED TO ACTUALLY INVEST I'M IN ONGOING FUNDS. I HOPE THAT WAS AN ANSWER. AND AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER AND I HOPE THAT SOMEONE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IS LISTENING UP OUT THERE THAT THAT MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION IS SOME OF THIS TIED. TO OTHER KINDS OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THAT'S BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE SPREAD HERE OR OR MEAN SURELY THERE IS SOME DATA OUT THERE SOMEWHERE THAT'S POINTED TO WHERE THE BECAUSE CAUSES ARE I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST CAUSES WE'VE SEEN JUST WITHIN THE LAST DECADE. IS THE ROCK THE RISE IN EASY CONTACT FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES ON THE INTERNET AND AND SOCIAL MEDIA. PEOPLE ARE HOOKING UP. MORE QUICKLY MORE ANONYMOUSLY THEY'RE ENGAGING IN UNPROTECTED SEX -- IN THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S BEEN SUCH A SPIKE IN YESTERDAY'S ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE I MEAN THAT THE HIGHEST RATE TO RECEIVING SEEN OUR FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND ESPECIALLY IN YOUNG WOMEN. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND A LOT OF IS BECAUSE THEY'RE CONNECTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HOOKING UP. THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ANSWER BUT THAT IS A MAJOR. ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION ON BEHAVIOR RISK FACTORS SURVEY FUNDING. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER -- I'M SUSAN TO MORRIS REPRESENTING THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND THIS IS ONE OF THE UNIQUE ITEMS THAT HAS NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT. I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR INCLUDING THIS ON THE AGENDA TODAY -- THE LAST TIME CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN THE BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SURVEY WAS. TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS IS A FORM OF RESEARCH CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCE IN FACT IT IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE CDC'S HEALTHY BRAIN INITIATIVE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER. IN THE HEARING -- WE HAVE THREE SOURCES OF REVENUE IN THE STATE THERE WAS ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH FUNDING -- PUT AN ON GOING BY GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR THERE'S A PROPOSAL THIS YEAR BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE'S TAX CHECK OFTEN THAT RAISES OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY THIS STAKEHOLDER REQUEST WOULD PROVIDE -- AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO USE ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THING OF CONDUCTING. THE BREAKFAST QUESTIONS ON COGNITIVE HEALTH. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE TOTAL COST OF THE QUESTION IS LESS THAN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IT ONLY HAPPENS EVERY FIVE YEARS. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO THIS COMMITTEE TO UP TO PROVIDE THAT AUTHORIZATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR PROPOSAL. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HYPERTENSION CONTROL PILOT PROGRAM GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JAMIE MORGAN AND I'M WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THE HYPERTENSION CONTROL PILOT PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AS YOU MAY KNOW HEART DISEASE AND STROKE ARE TWO OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH. IN FACT ONE PERSON DIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ABOUT EVERY THIRTY EIGHT SECONDS. WITHIN THE TWO MINUTES I HAVE TO SPEAK TODAY THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED. ONE OF THE MAJOR MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR THESE DISEASES IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. YET ONLY 53% OF ADULTS HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL. OFTEN CALLED THE SILENT KILLER HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HAS NO SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS. AND A PERSON CAN LIVE YEARS WITHOUT KNOWING THEY HAVE IT. CALIFORNIA ALMOST ONE IN THREE ADULTS HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WITH PREVALENCE RATES NEAR 40%. WE CAN AND NEED TO CHANGE THE STATISTICS YET THE STATE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR PREVENTION EDUCATION OR TREATMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HEART DISEASE OR STROKE. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL CREATE A FIVE SEVEN COUNTY PILOT PROGRAM. BASED ON NATIONAL GUIDELINES I'M SELF MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION. AND INCREASING THE COST CONTROL RATE AMONG PARTICIPANTS. THE DEPARTMENT WILL IDENTIFY THE COUNTIES USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA HIGHER RATES OF HYPERTENSION. HIGHER POPULATION OF THOSE GREAT AT GREATER RISK AND GEOGRAPHIC AND POPULATION SIZE DIVERSITY. WHAT'S THE COUNTIES ARE IDENTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM WITH FUNDING PRIORITIZE TO FQHCS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS. SINCE DIAGNOSED WITH HYPERTENSION WILL RECEIVE A BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICE FOR SELF MONITORING AT HOME. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WILL BE EMPLOYED BY THE CLINICS AND MAKE HOME VISITS TO ENSURE PATIENTS ARE MARKED MEASURING THE BLOOD PRESSURE. CORRECTLY AND INSIST CAM ASSISTING LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS THEY WILL ALSO PROVIDE OUTREACH AND FREE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS IN THE COMMUNITY WITH REFERRAL BACK TO CONNECT IF NECESSARY. AT THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT WILL EVALUATE AND REPORT THE FINDINGS. WE KNOW THAT SIMILAR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN BY FUNDING THIS PILOT PROGRAM WE CAN PROVE AND SAVE LIVES AS WELL AS THE STATE MONEY IN THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] Q. [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SAYING NONE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS BLACK WOMEN OVERWHELMED FOR WELLNESS ON SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. IT'S JUST ME TODAY ALL RIGHT THAT MEANS WE ARE ALL WE NEED. GOOD AFTERNOON OF I GUESS IT'S EVENING GOOD AFTER YOU GET IT GOOD EVENING ASSEMBLY WOMAN REYES AND ESTEEM TO MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JANET MIDDLEMAN AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY OF BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS WE ARE SPONSORING THE STAKEHOLDER BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY. ALONG WITH BLACK WOMAN FOR WELLNESS TO INCREASE FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM. DUE TO THE LACK OF FEDERAL REGULATION OF THE EIGHTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR COSMETICS INDUSTRY. AND THE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY BECAUSE MEDIC COMPANIES CAN AND DO LEGALLY SELL. BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS IN OUR STATE. IN FACT IN A RECENT REPORT ISSUED BY THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM. IT REVEALED THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO COMPANIES HAD DISCLOSED THE SALE. OF OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. CONTAINING EIGHTY EIGHT UNIQUE PROP SIXTY FIVE CARCINOGENS AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS. ILLUSTRATING THE VITAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM. THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE SAFE COSMETICS ACT CREATED THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES SELLING BEAUTY. AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IN OUR STATE. TO REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE PRESENCE OF ANY PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICAL IN THEIR PRODUCTS. THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM THEN MAKES THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE VIA A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED BY THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS. SALON WORKERS SCIENTISTS AND REGULATORS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEKS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION OF EXISTING FUNDING FOR THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO MODERNIZE THE ANTIQUATED SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAMS. ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM. THAT COMPANIES USE TO REPORT THE PRESENCE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS IN THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE STATE. TO FUND ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH STAFF TO ENSURE THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM. HAS THE HUMAN RESOURCES IT NEEDS SO THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION GETS INTO THE HANDS OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND WORKERS. AND TO ENSURE THAT COMPANIES ARE FULLY COMPLYING WITH THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS ACT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE INCREASE IN FUNDING WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM TO ACTUALLY USE ITS EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO INVESTIGATE AND REFER UNSAFE SALON WORKER EXPOSURES TO CAL OSHA. IN PROVIDE OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS AGAINST UNSAFE CHEMICAL EXPOSURES IN THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS THEY USE EVERY DAY. OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL IS IDENTICAL TO THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL THAT WAS APPROVED BY YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. IN THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THREE LAST YEAR. AND WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE BUDGET BILLS APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES. IT WAS SADLY AND SURPRISINGLY HOWEVER REJECTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. IN HIS SWEEPING DISMISSAL LAST YEAR OF NEW FUNDING AN INITIATIVE. WE HOPE THAT THE ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WILL ONCE AGAIN SUPPORT ARE IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER BUDGET REQUEST TO INCREASE FUNDING AND SUPPORT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SING THEM I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION [inaudible] THANK YOU OUR HEPATITIS C. H. C. B. PER PREVENTION CALIFORNIA HEPATITIS ALLIANCE. FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND THEN THIS -- MY NAME IS STAND ON LAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HEPATITIS LINES WERE HERE TO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND FOR HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION LINKAGE TO AND RETENTION AND CARE AND TREATMENT -- CURRENTLY THERE AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH HCV MOST OF WHOM DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR STATUS. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL REPORTS THAT H. THAT -- HEPATITIS C. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE DEATHS THAN THE NEXT FIFTY NINE INFECTIOUS DISEASES COMBINED. WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE THE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPANDED ACCESS TO HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT IN ALL OF ITS PUBLIC SYSTEMS. HOWEVER THE ATTENTION TO AND THE FUNDING FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO THAT TREATMENT AND CARE. ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING -- WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO ELIMINATE TO CURE HEPATITIS C. NOW AND YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE INCIDENTS RISE IN THE STATE. THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NEW HEPATITIS C. CASES WERE REPORTED IN. 200-016-2011 TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE RATES OF HEPATITIS C. INCREASED BY 50% AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HEPATITIS C. INCREASE IN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE BY A HUNDRED AND 48%. ALTHOUGH BLACKS ARE ONLY 6% OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION THEY MAKE UP 12% OF NEW AGE CV INFECTIONS. SO WE ARE SUGGESTING TO MICRO ELIMINATION PROJECTS FOR HEPATITIS C. IN THOSE ARE PROJECTS FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR POPULATION WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN CREATE. A HUGE IMPACT. WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE PROGRAMS TO ELIMINATE HEPATITIS C. AMONG PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AND THEIR PARTNERS. THIS REQUEST IS INTENDED TO BUILD ON A SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND UNFORTUNATELY HAD ENDED NOW. ON THEY TESTED OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THEY FOUND A SEVEN POINT 5% POSITIVITY RATE. AND 95% OF THOSE WHO ARE LINKED TO CARE WERE CURED. IN ADDITION WE'RE ASKING FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ELIMINATE HEPATITIS C. IN PEOPLE HER CO INFECTED WITH HEPATITIS C. AND H. ID. AND WE KNOW IN THIS CASE THAT THE TWO DISEASES TOGETHER CREATE A CONDITION THAT WE'RE BOTH DISEASES ACT MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND THAT LEADS TO MUCH INCREASED MORE MORBIDITY. SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD ON THE HIV CARE AND PREVENTION -- SYSTEM HERE AND IN CALIFORNIA. TO INSURE THAT WE ELIMINATE H. CV AND THOSE WHO ARE CO INFECTED. SO WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] COMMENTS QUESTIONS. NO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. HIV PREVENTION CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CRACKPOTS FOR FROM A PURELY HEALTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE -- WE'RE REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE HIV PREVENTION SERVICES INCLUDING HIV TESTING EXPANDED PREP ACCESS LINKAGE TO CARE AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO AN HIV EPIDEMIC HAVE STALLED DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL PROGRESS. THE STATE'S ANNUAL RATE OF NEW HIV INFECTIONS DECREASE JUST 2% FROM 200-013-22017. CALIFORNIA'S NOW FALLING BEHIND OTHER STATES WERE GOVERNMENT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE IMPLEMENTING AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE VIRUS. NEW YORK STATE FOR EXAMPLE HAS COMMITTED MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO AN HIV EPIDEMIC SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN AND NEW DIAGNOSES HAVE ALREADY DECLINED SADLY CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS IS NO SURPRISE TO PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES CALIFORNIA SLASHED OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM HIV PROGRAMS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND LITTLE HAS BEEN RESTORED. THOSE CUTS ELIMINATED STATE FUNDED PREVENTION EFFORTS IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING HIV TESTING. AND MOST CBO SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY REACH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS A RESULT DISPARITIES ARE INCREASING OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE RATE OF NEW INFECTIONS AMONG WHITES DECLINE NEARLY 13% WHILE DECREASING ONLY 2% AMONG BLACKS. AND INCREASING RATES AMONG TRANS WOMEN ARE THE HIGHEST FOR IN FOR ANY GROUP. THESE DISPARITIES UNDERSCORE THE URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND HIV PREVENTION EFFORTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. OVER THE LAST DECADE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TOOLS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THEY CAN LITERALLY STOP HIV IN ITS TRACKS BUT TOO FEW PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TOOLS. PROP UP TAKING CALIFORNIA REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW AND PROBLEMATIC GEOGRAPHIC AND RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES ARE PLAYING NOW. NEARLY HALF OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN CALIFORNIA LACK CONSISTING CARE HER ACCESS TO TREATMENT. CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. THE PROPOSED PROPOSED FUNDING WILL PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN CBO'S TO SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE HIV PREVENTION SERVICES. THESE EFFORTS WILL BE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. TO REDUCE NEW HIV DIAGNOSES AMONG MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING PEOPLE OF COLOR GAME AND TRANS WOMEN IN PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT SO THAT THE STATE IS NOT CONTINUE TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I WILL SHARE THAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IS THAT. MUCH OF THE FUNDING IS BASED ON THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED TO GO TO PALM SPRINGS WITH THEIR SERVICES OR TO LOS ANGELES. SO WHEN THERE'S AN EFFORT TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW THE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE DONE. THE INLAND EMPIRE DOESN'T GET IT BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS WAS DONE OUTSIDE OF OF OUR DISTRICT. IS THAT A CONSIDERATION THAT WILL BE -- IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD CONSIDER -- YEAH. WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE FUNDING SHOULD YOU RECEIVE THIS? YEAH WE HAVE -- WE HAVE HEARD THAT CONCERNED HAVE DISCUSSED THAT WITH SOME OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE INFORMATION THAT THE CDC COLLECTS REPORTS IN THE INFORMATION THAT THE STATE HAS SO HAPPY TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION SHARE WITH YOU BUT WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE OFFICE OF BATES AND THEY DO HAVE. ACCURATE INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS TARGETED TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST SO HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU. PRETTY GOOD AYE AYE WHEN YOU HAVE A MOMENT I WOULD LIKE. TO TO HAVE YOU SHARE THAT SO THAT I CAN SHARE WITH MY MY COMMUNITY YEAH ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. FARMWORKERS FARMWORKER HEALTHY HEALTH STUDY. CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOE OLD DERRINGER I'M HERE WITH NO EIGHT BOTTOM OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE. IN SUPPORTING IN FAVOR OF A REQUEST FOR A PRIMARY HEALTH STUDY WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS. INCLUDING SEE PAN THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE PEARL STUDIES UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER AND THE DOLORES HUERTA FOUNDATION AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS -- I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ROBERT REEVE US AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS FOR SIGNING ON IN A SUPPORT LETTER IN FAVOR OF THIS. SO AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE'S FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR HEALTH -- AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. HOWEVER WE'VE KNOWN FROM PAST STUDIES TWENTY YEARS AGO ABOUT SOME VERY POOR HEALTH STATUS. AS WE WERE DEVELOPING POLICY PROPOSALS ARE STARTED DEVELOPING POLICY PROPOSALS TO PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE WE REALIZE THERE'S A COMPLETE DATA GAP. IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND IS DOCTOR WOULD WAS SUGGESTING WITHOUT DATA IT'S REALLY HARD TO MAKE EFFECTIVE AND TARGETED POLICY -- THE LAST AND ONLY FARMWORKERS HEALTH STUDY AS I SAID WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO -- DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR RURAL STUDIES WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENED SINCE THEN HOW IS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ACTUALLY HELPED OR NOT -- FOR FARMWORKERS QUEST 70% WERE UNINSURED THAT TIME. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY MORE INSURED AT THIS POINT FOR MANY REASONS RELATED TO IMMIGRATION. AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS -- HOW HAS ALL THE FUNDING AN EXPANDED ROLE CAPACITY IN CLINICS -- ACTUALLY HELP FARMWORKERS HOW WITH ALL OF OUR PREVENTIVE HEALTH EFFORTS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF PRESENTATIONS TODAY HOW THEY ACTUALLY REACHING FARMWORKERS. AND THEN LASTLY HOW WOULD THE MEDIC HOW FOR ALL OF THE HELP FOR ALL PROPOSALS. IN THE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY AFFECT FARMWORKERS SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE WERE PROPOSED TO LOOK AT TWO OR THREE PARTS STUDY. ONE WOULD BE AN ACTUAL SURVEY OF PROBABLY CLOSE TO A THOUSAND FARMWORKERS INCLUDING PHYSICAL EXAMS AND BLOOD TESTS WHICH WAS DONE IN THE ORIGINAL STUDY. ANOTHER ONE IS -- WORKING WITH THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING. TERMS OF OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE AND LESS IS REVIEWING POLICY -- IN ALL THIS WILL REALLY HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT PROPOSALS AND WHAT POLICIES TO BRING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO APPROVE -- THE HEALTH OF ALL APART FROM. WELL IT WOULD BE UP TO THE FINDING WOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WOULD CONTRACT OUT AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PROCESS. TAKES SAID IT'S THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR RURAL STUDIES THAT DID THE PREVIOUS STUDY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE I KNOW THERE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT IT AGAIN. I'VE TALKED TO THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER WHICH HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE HEALTH COVERAGE AREA. TO REALLY HELP WITH THAT AND THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL. WONDERFUL. QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH PROPOSAL. PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE [inaudible] HELLO. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR. MY NAME IS TRADER MODEL BUT I'M THE PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SAMBAR DINO COUNTY AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUDGET REQUEST. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ARE YOU GOING TO IMPROVE AND REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN UNPRECEDENTED UPTICK IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS. WE SEE THE EVIDENCE EVERY DAY IN THE NEWS WHETHER IT'S THE MEASLES OUTBREAK ARISE IN A CD RATES. ARE RISE AND VALLEY FEVER AS WELL TO MEASLES OUTBREAK OR THE HEPATITIS OUTBREAK OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE WOEFULLY UNDER RESOURCE. IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY ARE UNIQUE AND VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN TERMS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL. AND IT IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT NO OTHER ENTITY IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR AT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE FUNDING THAT COMES FROM CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHEN YOU EXCLUDE THE FUNDING SPECIFIC TO HIV AND AIDS? LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE SLATED TO RECEIVE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN IN ADDITION WHEN YOU COMPARE EIGHT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE SLATED TO RECEIVE OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LESS IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS. IN SEVENTY NO COUNTY ALONE THAT AMOUNTS TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S VITAL THAT ANY FUNDING THAT COME TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BE FLEXIBLE AND NOT DISEASE SPECIFIC. SO THAT WE COULD ADDRESS EITHER THE DISEASES IN ISSUES FACING US TODAY AS WELL AS ANY EMERGING DISEASES THAT COULD FACE US IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIVERSITY OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LIKE MINE. TO INCREASE CRITICAL STAFFING WHETHER IT'S EPIDEMIOLOGIST. COMMUTE CALL DISEASE INVESTIGATORS OR FRANKLY TO INCREASE OUR LAB CAPACITY. THESE FUNCTIONS HELP TO INCREASE MY ENTIRE ABILITY TO ADDRESS ALL DISEASES IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THEY MIGHT BE. WITHOUT INVESTMENTS INTO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FRANKLY ARE JUST GOING TO BE ON ABLE TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET ASK THANK YOU. YES DOCTOR WITH. QUESTION YOU YOU SAID -- EARLY IN YOUR COMMENT YOU SAID TO REBUILD -- IS THAT. CORRECT. YES SO IT TOO IN 200-022-22000 SEVEN EIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD SIGNIFICANT CUTS -- OVER WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE AND WE USE THAT TWO THOUSAND TWO SAID -- BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE PERIOD RIGHT BEFORE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THAT'S WHEN WE SAW THAT IT DRAMATIC DECREASES IN REALIGNMENT DOLLARS -- AND I'D LIKE TO USE REALIGNMENTS BECAUSE THAT IS AN AREA OF FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IT'S WHAT WE USE IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT A LOT OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IS OFTEN TIMES IF YOU SEE INCREASES. IN A FUNDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IT'S UNFORTUNATELY IT'S CATEGORICAL SO IT ALLOWS US TO ONLY ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC DISEASE -- IN A VERY SPECIFIC POPULATION WITH POSSIBLY A VERY UNIQUE INTERVENTION -- WE TYPICALLY OF USE REALIGNMENT THOUGH TO PERFORM ALL OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT. SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS MEASLES AT ONE POINT -- HEPATITIS A HEPATITIS. C. ARE INCREASING RATES AND STDS AND THE LIKE. SO HAVE YOU HAVE YOU NOT SEEN -- IMAGE DURING THE RECESSION WERE YOU WERE YOU WERE YOUR WAS YOUR LEVEL FUNDING CUT. SIGNIFICANTLY AND NOT SEEN. HAVE YOU NOT SEEN A RESTORATION -- WE HAVE NOT SO AS WE'VE LOOKED AT A NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT THAT'S THE ONE I'M SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING TO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AVAILABLE THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT DOLLARS -- FREE THE RECESSION AND WE COMPARE IT TO THE AVAILABLE DOLLARS TODAY WE HAVE NOT SEEN A RESTORATION OF THOSE DOLLARS. WOW. THAT'S PRETTY AND SO CONSEQUENTLY I BE THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN ELEVEN YEARS -- WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IS AND I SAY REBUILD BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IS A DEGRADATION? OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS -- SOME OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS AND FRANKLY -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE THE ONLY ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THESE PARTICULAR THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THIS FUNDING THEN BE -- IN A WAY IT IS. TO FIND THE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE FLEXIBLE. FOR SO THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND THEIR THEIR UNIQUE I MEAN THIS IS A DIVERSE STATE SO NOT I COUNTIES NEEDS ARE THE SAME EXACTLY -- TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I RECENTLY SAT WITH MY CHEMICAL DISEASE INVESTIGATORS. AND THE ISSUE THAT WE WERE SPEAKING TO WAS CONGENITAL SYPHILIS -- JUST SO YOU KNOW IN SUMMER DINO ARE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS RATES INCREASED BY 70%. BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH WERE A LOT OF WOMEN THAT WERE HOMELESS -- AND A LOT OF WOMEN THAT WERE ALSO DRUG USING. AT THE SAME TIME -- JUSTIN THIS EARLY PART OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE SEE NINE HEPATITIS EIGHT CASES. SPREAD OUT THERE ARE TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES -- AT IN COMPARISON WE HAD TWELVE TOTAL HEPATITIS EIGHT CASES LAST YEAR -- AND THEN AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF -- WE ARE A KIND OF ON PINS AND NEEDLES RIGHT NOW I'M JUST WAITING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL END UP WITH THE MEASLES -- CASE BECAUSE OF THE CASES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO THE IDEA OF PROVIDING FLEXIBLE FUNDING IT WOULD GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECT STAFF OUT INTO THE FIELD TO ADDRESS THE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASE -- AT THE SAME TIME LOOK TO SEE HOW I CAN MITIGATE -- THE HEPATITIS EIGHT HOW IT CASES THAT I'VE GOT BUT ALSO CONSEQUENTLY BE PREPARED IN THE EVENT THAT I GET A MEASLES OUTBREAK -- WE I KNOW THE INCREASES IN VALLEY FEVER -- ARE AN ISSUE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO. OUR REQUEST IS THAT THE FUNDING BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SO THAT INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. CAN ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT THEY'VE GOT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AYE AYES WAS I'VE FOUGHT I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST ON OF A COUPLE OF THE COUNTIES. THAT I'M AWARE OF IT -- THAT I REPRESENT THAT ARE THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS REQUEST AND I THINK -- FOR ME THE IMPORTANCE IS THE FLEXIBILITY -- I REPRESENT A VERY DIVERSE DISTRICT AND WITHOUT THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT THE CATEGORY BECAUSE AS YOU DESCRIBED -- DON'T HELP IN MANY IN MANY OF THESE CASES BECAUSE OUR SOME OF THE COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE. THAT PARTICULAR NEEDS SO -- THIS JUST FEELS LIKE AN EXAMPLE OF OF THE WERE THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A BUDGET CUTS. THAT AND AS WE'VE HEARD EARLIER THE THE THE RAPID AND AND SIGNIFICAN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN STDS -- THIS IS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WE DON'T GO BACK AND RE FUND. PROGRAMS WHEN WE HAVE BUDGET CUTS AND REBUILD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WAS MY NOTE CORRECT THAT CONGENITAL SYPHILIS INCREASED CORRECT. BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN YEAH SOME OF THE REASONS ARE MEDINA COUNTY ARE ALARMING -- ONE THAT STANDS OUT IN MY MIND IS CHLAMYDIA WE ACTUALLY STAND NUMBER. FOURTEEN IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR CHLAMYDIA CASES. IT'S NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR WELL NO I DO WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR PRESENTING THIS NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BUT ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN CALIFORNIA. DOCTOR WHAT IS CORRECT THIS IS IT IS ALARMING WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF PRESENTATIONS. REGARDING THE INCREASE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING DONE. AND INVESTMENT. INTO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS OR THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS AND HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU HONOR TO BE HERE THANK YOU. HARM REDUCTION CARE NAVIGATORS. GOOD EVENING CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HAVE THE NEXT TWO ITEMS WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PRESENT THEM TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY. DO THEM SEPARATELY PLEASE CHECK. THE FIRST AT I'M LARA THOMAS AND THE DEPUTY STATE DIRECTOR FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE AND THE FIRST REQUEST IS. TO ADD STAFF TO THE SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE AS A NO -- YOU'RE WELL AWARE -- CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN OVERDOSE CRISIS WERE OVERDOSE IS NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH IN THE STATE AS IT IS -- IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT WITH BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS CALIFORNIA IS EXPANDING ITS TREATMENT CAPACITY ESPECIALLY FOR METHADONE OR BUPRENORPHINE ACROSS THE STATE. ARE PROPOSAL TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THAT TREATMENT CAPACITY BY PUTTING TREATMENT NAVIGATORS IN OUR HARM REDUCTION AND SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT THEY CAN HELP US RANGE ACCESS PARTICIPANTS NAVIGATE AT AND SUCCESSFULLY CONNECT WITH. THIS NEW EXPANDED TREATMENT CAPACITY I'M MORE ASKING FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OVER FOUR YEARS. AND IT WOULD ADD STAFF -- IN EACH OF THE PROGRAM'S AROUND THE STATE -- THE STATE OFFICE OF AIDS IS IN THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING THE NUMBERS RANGE ACCESS PROGRAMS -- TO ENSURE THAT WERE REACHING SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REACHED -- BY THESE IMPORTANT HARM REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE AFFECTIVELY PREVENTING HIV AND HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSION. BUT THERE WERE ALSO ABLE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO OVERDOSE -- AWARENESS INFORMATION AND THE LOCKS ON AND IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY CAN BE SOME OF THE FOLKS WERE FIRST IN LINE TO ACCESS THE EXPANDED TREATMENT CAPACITY -- FOR OPIATE USE DISORDER [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A QUESTION AS YOU AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DID A DISH YOU KNOW INCREASES IN SYRINGE PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR -- PRETTY CONSISTENTLY IS -- WITH MORE SYRINGES BECOMES MORE SYRINGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CAUSING -- CONCERNED BY MY CONSTITUENTS. ARE THERE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH TO HELP WITH WITH REGARDS. TO RETRIEVING AS MANY OF THOSE SYRINGES AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT IS BECOMING AN INCREASE THAT IT THAT THAT IS THOUGH. WITHOUT THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT INCREASED RESISTANCE TO THESE PROGRAMS WHICH WHICH WERE WHICH ARE VITAL TO BEING HELP HELP HELP. PREVENT DISEASE SO. IF IT'S NOT THERE IT'S SHOULD MISS OF A HOBBY CONSIDERING I THINK. YES AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT -- STAFF ITS RANGE ACCESS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ABLE TO DO IS TO ASSIST WITH COMMUNITY LEVEL DISPOSAL EFFORTS AND TO WORK WITH PARTICIPANTS -- TO COLLECT SYRINGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT -- MANY OF OUR SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS ARE ENTIRELY VOLUNTEER RUN AROUND A VERY SHOE STRING -- BASIS AND DON'T HAVE MUCH FUNDING FOR STAFFING SO ONE OF THE WAYS TO IMPROVE SYRINGE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL IS TO INCREASE THE STAFFING LEVELS AT THESE PROGRAM SO -- PEOPLE CAN BE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND BE RESPONSIVE WHEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF SYRINGES THAT THEY CAN GO OUT AND HELP WITH PICK UP AND DISPOSAL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S DO THE SUPPLIES CLEARING HOUSE. SO AT THIS IS -- RELATED -- CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A FUNDING CLEARING HOUSE SUPPLY CLEARING HOUSE FOR THIS ORANGE ACCESS PROGRAMS. AROUND THE STATE IT'S CURRENTLY FUNDED AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE ARE REQUESTING AN INCREASE TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THIS EXPANSION OF SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS AND AS A RESULT THERE ARE RUNNING THROUGH -- SUPPLIES -- QUICKLY AND WE'VE SEEN -- IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD FOR EXAMPLE A PARTICIPANTS THAT SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE AND WITH THAT INCREASE IN NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. IS A INCREASE AND DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES SO -- WE KNOW THAT SYRINGE ACCESS IS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE HIV AND HEPATITIS C. PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE. AND THESE PROGRAMS DESPERATELY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES -- THE FUNDING GOES TO THE STATE OFFICE OF AIDS WITH CENTRALIZED PURCHASING TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE GETTING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. SUPPLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THE SMALL SHOESTRING OPERATIONS DON'T HAVE TO DO THEIR OWN PURCHASING BUT CAN GO THROUGH THE STATE AND IT'S REALLY HAD ENORMOUS ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE SUPPLIES AND THE WAY IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN ENGAGE WITH THE PARTICIPANTS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. LITTLE BY LITTLE LITERACY PROGRAM EXPANSION [inaudible] WELCOME. IT WILL TURN ON AS SOON AS YOU RIGHT. IS IT ON ITS OWN OKAY GREAT. ALL RIGHT -- CHAIR WOMEN RACE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR BLING COLOR. I AM A PHYSICIAN AND PRESIDENT OF THE NONPROFIT AGENCY CALLED SALUTE A HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST FUNDING IN SUPPORT OF A PROPOSED STATEWIDE EXPANSION OF THE LITTLE BY LITTLE SCHOOL READINESS PROGRAM. LITTLE BY LITTLE IS AN EVIDENCE BASED EARLY LITERACY PROGRAM ADMINISTERED THROUGH WICK CENTERS THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED GREAT SUCCESS AND A HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION I LEAD CALLED BALLOON HEALTH DECIDED TO DEVELOP LITTLE BY LITTLE BECAUSE IN EARLY RESEARCH STUDY BY HEART AND RECENTLY. FOUND THAT BY THREE YEARS OF AGE THERE IS AN ESTIMATED THIRTY MILLION WORD GAP IN LANGUAGE HEARD BETWEEN CHILDREN FROM THE WEALTHIEST IN THE POOREST FAMILIES. THAT LANGUAGE GAP TRANSLATES INTO LIFELONG EDUCATIONAL DISPARITIES. WITH THE SUPPORT SUPPORT FROM FIRST FIVE LOS ANGELES HELLO TO HELP LAUNCH LITTLE BY LITTLE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IS A PILOT PROGRAM. AND OPERATED IN SIX SITES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IN ITS FIVE YEAR PILOT PHASE FROM 200-032-2000 EIGHT LITTLE BY LITTLE REACHED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. BETWEEN THE AGES OF BIRTH TO FIVE IMPROVE REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE. A STUDY FROM THIS PILOT PHASE REVEALED THAT WEEK CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE LITTLE BY LITTLE SERVICES HAD HIGHER SCHOOL READINESS AND LANGUAGE SCORES THAN THOSE WITH CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT. WE'RE SUBMITTING A COPY OF THE RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN PEDIATRICS FOR YOUR REVIEW. GIVEN THE EVIDENCE THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE WORKS FIRST FIVE LA REFUNDED THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWELVE FOR TEN YEARS. IN THIS PROGRAM WEEK STAFF ARE TRAINED AND PROMPTED BASED ON THE CHILD'S AGE TO EDUCATE PARENTS PARENTS ON APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES AND TO ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO READ TO AND WITH THEIR CHILDREN. FREE HIGH FREE HIGH QUALITY BOOKS ARE PROVIDED AT EACH VISIT SO THAT BY THE TIME THE CHILD ENTERS KINDERGARTEN THEY HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED A SMALL HOME LIBRARY OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY BOOKS. BY USING THE WAKE PLATFORM FOR PROGRAM DELIVERY PROGRAM COSTS REMAIN LOW AVERAGING ONLY FIFTY TWO DOLLARS PER CHILD PER YEAR. WHICH SITES ARE ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT YOUNG FAMILIES VISIT REGULARLY FROM A MOTHER'S PREGNANCY THROUGH THE CHILD'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY. MAKING THEM UNIQUELY SUITABLE FOR AN EVIDENCE BASED EARLY LITERACY PROGRAM LIKE THIS. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE LITTLE BY LITTLE HAS SERVED OVER A HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS AND DISTRIBUTED NEARLY A MILLION BOOKS. HELLO TO HEALTH BELIEVES THAT WHEN PARENTS BECOME ENGAGED EARLY IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION AND WHEN CHILDREN ARE GIVEN EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY THEY WILL THRIVE. AND WE ALL BENEFIT FROM A MORE EDUCATED AND MORE PRODUCTIVE. OF SOCIETY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY LET ME JUST SAY THAT YOU'LL SEE A RANGE OF FUNDING SUBMITTED FROM ONE POINT SEVEN TO THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. WHAT WE SUPPORT SCALING STATEWIDE IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF NEED WHICH WOULD BE THE TOTAL COST OF THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION BEING MINDFUL OF COST WE HAVE SUBMITTED ALTERNATIVE BUDGETS? TO FUNDED PLANNING YEAR OR A PLANNING YOUR WITH AN INITIAL SCALE TO FIVE SITES THROUGHOUT THE SITE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN BLANCA RUBIO WHO HAS SHARED A LETTER OF SUPPORT AND BEEN A CHAMPION OF THIS PROGRAM AS WELL I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEEN QUEER WOMEN'S HEALTH HAS BEEN INVISIBLE WITHIN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DESPITE FACING SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES AND BARRIERS TO CARE. ONE INTO LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION AND HEALTH CARE. 30% HAVE DELAYED CARE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. YET RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN HAVE INCREASED RATES OF DISABILITY. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DEPRESSION. ARE MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE AND DRINK IN FACT I'LL BE CUTE GIRLS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO YOU HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. HAVE INCREASED PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR CANCER AND BECAUSE OF DILL PLAYED SCREENING HIGHER MORTALITY ONE CLAN AT THE CENTER AFTER HOMOPHOBIC EXPERIENCE DURING A PAP SMEAR. AT A AT HER FIRST OBGYN. DIDN'T GO BACK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS UNTIL SHE FINALLY CAME TO THE CENTER SHE NOW HAS STAGE FOUR CANCER CERVICAL CANCER. THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIRE FOR LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN OF COLOR OLDER ADULTS ENTRANCE L. B. Q. WOMEN. WE ARE ASKING CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE NATION BY ALLOCATING SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION IN GENERAL FUNDS TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY FUND. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THIS WILL BE THE FIRST EVER TARGETED EFFORT TO DRESS WHAT IS OFTEN BEEN A VERY INVISIBLE POPULATION WITH AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS.

I THANK YOU ISN'T TATIAN. LIQUID SUGAR RESEARCH GRANTS. GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS DOCTOR FAUCHON CO FOR AND I'M A SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. AND WE ARE PLEASED TO REQUEST A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF SIX POINT NINE ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION OF CHRONIC DISEASE AN INJURY CONTROL. UP TO ISSUE AND ADMINISTER A RESEARCH REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS TO CALIFORNIA BASED ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. THE RP WILL SOLICIT PROPOSALS TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUGAR IN LIQUID FORM CAUSES MORE DETRIMENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS THAN SUGAR IN SOLID FORM. EXAMINING SOME OF THOSE INTERMEDIATE CHANGES THAT EXISTING BIOMARKERS. NEARLY ALL OF THE CLINICAL STUDIES THAT EXISTS TO DATE HAVE -- DOCUMENTED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF SUGAR CONSUMPTION THAT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON SUGARY DRINKS HOWEVER A SUGARY DRINKS ARE NOT THE ONLY FORM OF SUGAR IN OUR DIETS APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ADDED SUGAR IS CONSUMED FROM SOLID FOODS. AND THIS PROPORTION MAY INCREASE WITH RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES FOCUS ON DECREASING CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS. AND SO ALTHOUGH THERE'S EVIDENCE OF THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SUGARY DRINKS THAT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THERE ARE NO WILL PUBLISH DIETARY INTERVENTION STUDIES LASTING MORE THAN ONE DAY THAT HAVE DIRECTLY COMPARED THE EFFECT. OF SOLID SUGAR AND LIQUID SUGAR ON RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND TYPE TWO DIABETES AND SO THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REMEDY THAT GAP IN THE LITERATURE BY CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. COMPARING THE TWO YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE YOUR OTHER. INFORMATION BUT WHO WILL BE DOING THE STUDY. THE STUDY WOULD BE CONDUCTED BY CALIFORNIA BASED ACADEMIC -- INSTITUTIONS SO BE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS THAT WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. Q.. THE QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROPOSAL. SOMETHING THE NEXT ONE YES I AM. THANK YOU BEVERAGE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. YES. THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE DIVISION OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND INJURY CONTROL NUTRITION EDUCATION AND OBESITY PREVENTION BRANCH. RECEIVE A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO BE SPENT OVER THIRTY SIX MONTHS. TO ISSUE A STATEWIDE COMMUNITY GRANTS -- TO CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS FOR SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE -- DEMONSTRATING THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERE IDEA OF HEALTH CONDITIONS -- THE TOTALITY OF EVIDENCE HAS LED TO MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE US DIETARY GUIDELINES AND FOOD THE FOOD LABELING REGULATIONS -- TO PROMOTE LOWER SUGAR CONSUMPTION HOWEVER MANY CONSUMERS ARE UNAWARE THAT STUDENTS ARE JACK ARE AWARE THAT SOLDIERS ARE GENERALLY AND HEALTHY -- YET THEY MAY BE UNAWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THE HEALTH IMPACT -- SUCH AS THAT ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES THEIR RISK OF CAVITIES TO FULL DIABETES 26% AND OBESITY BY 55%. AND FURTHER MORE -- MANY CONSUMERS INCLUDING PARENTS ARE UNAWARE THAT THERE'S A BROAD CLASSIFICATION OF DRINKS THAT ARE SUGARY DRINKS BEYOND JUST OTIS -- INCLUDING ENERGY DRINKS AND SPORTS DRINKS AND OTHER TYPES OF DRINKS AND SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THROUGH THE RESEARCH THAT I'M PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION ACTUALLY HELPS PARENTS MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS. AND SO THE CAMPAIGN WOULD EMPLOY A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH COMBINING SOCIAL MEDIA AND TARGETED GRASSROOTS MESSAGING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF SUGARY -- DRINKS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY DRINKS WITH ADDED SUGAR AND THAT -- THEY'RE ABLE TO ALSO APPROPRIATELY READ -- NUTRITION CONTENT LABELS AND SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR IT -- AGAIN COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO EXIST FOR CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUGARY DRINKS HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NO I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THIS CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WILL OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

I HAVE WORKED IN GREEN BE THE FOR A LONG TIME IT'S HIGH TIME THAT THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY BE TAKEN ON BURKE THE CHEMICAL YOU THINK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S GO [inaudible] TO ISSUE THIRTEEN AND I'M RELATED TO THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE -- BUT SINCE DH CS DIRECTORS HERE -- I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU AND DH CS. FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION AND A PLAN FOR DRESSING THE PROBLEMS WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BUT BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER. THESE CONCERNS WERE RAISED AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S HEARING ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND. AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE REQUESTED DH CS TO SUBMIT A CORRECTIVE PLAN ACT CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. BY TODAY. AND DH CS DID EXACTLY THAT. WELL I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE YET TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION THOROUGHLY. IT APPEARS A DH CS IS TAKING THESE ISSUES QUITE SERIOUSLY AND ADDRESSING THEM AGGRESSIVELY WHICH IS EXACTLY. WHAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HOPED YOU WOULD DO I THANK YOU? OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE -- THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS GOT THE REPORT -- AND AS OF TONIGHT WE HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE OUT OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE ON THE WAIT LIST SO WE HAD 95%. CONTACT AND HAVE ASSESSMENT SO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS THANK YOU -- SO US. TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S I VALUE BASED -- PROGRAM PROPOSAL IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING -- OPPORTUNITY FOR US USING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING -- SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE PROPOSING -- TO GO DOWN TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL IN WHICH WE'RE PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS THAT MAKE -- DEMONSTRATED CHANGES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF OPPORTUNITY THAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE PROGRESS MADE IN TERMS OF TREATING PATIENTS AND SO REFLECTIVE. OF SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR FELT WERE IMPORTANT -- TO IN CAPS LEE IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOUR MAIN CATEGORIES -- WHICH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE -- CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD INITIATIVE AND SO BACK IN MARCH WE HAD RELEASE FOR STAKEHOLDER -- FEEDBACK AND REVIEW -- SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEASURES -- IN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE -- TALKING ABOUT -- VACCINES -- DOING PRENATAL PROCESSES VACCINES PRENATAL CARE VISITS POST PARTUM CARE VISITS. POST PARTUM DEPRESSION SCREENING AND POST PARTUM BIRTH CONTROL -- IN EARLY CHILDHOOD WELL CHILD VISITS -- FOR CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE PROPOSED -- PERIODICITY SCHEDULE IN WHICH WERE LOOKING TO INCREASE UTILIZATION IN THOSE AREAS. ALL CHILDHOOD VACCINES FOR TWO YEAR OLD SUPPORT LED SCREENING AND DENTAL FLUORIDE VARNISH. FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT WE IDENTIFIED CONTROLLING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SO TO THE TESTIMONY EARLIER AROUND HYPERTENSION PROGRAM -- DIABETES CARE CONTROL OF PERSISTENT ASTHMA TOBACCO USE SCREENING AND ADULT INFLUENCE OF VACCINES. AND THEN LASTLY -- THE ONE THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING FOR US THAT I THINK WE REALLY DO FEEL -- THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE IS AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGE IN THIS IS THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CLINICAL MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THIS AREA. BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SCREENING FOR CLINICAL DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION MEDICATION SCREENING FOR UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE AND THEN CO LOCATION OF PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THE RESPNSES WHEN WE RELEASED BOTH THESE PROPOSED MEASURES AS WELL AS THE TRAILER BILL WE GOT A LOT OF REALLY THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK -- THERE WAS SOME ADDITIONAL -- ITEMS THAT WE THINK HAVE VALUE AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE -- MAKING SOME CHANGES THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISIONS AROUND SOME OF THE MEASURE SO WE REALLY DO ACKNOWLEDGE -- SOME OF THE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT FROM STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY AROUND CERTAIN CHRONIC DISEASES -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL -- IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL WANT TO HAVE FURTHER ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH BOTH THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO BACK INTO THESE PAYMENTS -- THROUGH OUR MANAGED CARE CAPITATION RATES SO WE DON'T HAVE DOLLAR AMOUNTS PROPOSED AT THIS TIME JUST BECAUSE WE STILL NEED TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT WE SETTLE ON AND THEN THERE'S A MUCH MORE -- KIND OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR HEALTH PLANS AND OUR ACTUARIES AND THEN THAT ALL HAS TO GET APPROVED. THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ATTRACTED PAYMENT SO THE TRAILER BILL REALLY DOES REFLECT SOME OF THE NEED FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL BUT ALSO KIND OF THE BROAD. YOU KNOW WAY IN WHICH WE INTEND TO APPLY THESE PAYMENT SO -- WITHOUT I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU -- BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE REALLY WELCOME THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND IN WITHIN THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM INCLUDING AND IN IN MANAGED CARE WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP BETWEEN THE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS AND THE MEASURES THAT WE'VE GOT BE PAYING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. ON BEHALF AND MANY OF THE MEASURES THAT -- DH CS IS PLANNING TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT ON THROUGH ITS OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF PROVIDING BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AND INCREASED OVERSIGHT ON BEHALF OF MANY OF THE SAME MEASURES -- AND THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. WEATHER PERMITTING HIS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC. ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTEEN LINDA TENER WHAT'S OF THE CALIFORNIA OF HANNAH THINK HEALTH NETWORK -- WE JUST WANNA APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT -- THE COMMITMENT TO ADOPTING A VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM -- HOWEVER WE WOULD REQUEST OF THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDE -- DISPARITIES SENSITIVE METRICS -- THAT DEMONSTRATE. A REDUCTION IN HEALTH DISPARITIES AND THAT AND THAT TEACH YES CONSULT WITH THE BROAD -- SET OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE MECHANICS OF WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TO A WORKABLE SOLUTION TO ACHIEVE THOSE BENCHMARKS [inaudible] THANK YOU -- VICTOR CHRISTY WITH CALVIN HELPLESS ADVOCATES ON BEHALF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS -- AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THEY SURE IS FULL -- ELVIS PAYMENT PARTICIPATION FOR ALL MEDICAL PROVIDERS AS FOR THE NOTE AS THE AGENDA NOTES WELL IT IS TRUE THAT AFTER HE SEES DO RECEIVE. A UNIQUE PPS RATE -- THAT RECOGNIZES THE INTEGRATED CARE THEY PROVIDE THIS RATE WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE NOR SHOULD IT BE A BARRIER TO HEALTH CENTERS PARTICIPATING IN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. IT'S A MATTER EQUALITY FOR ALL MEDICAL PATIENTS IN THE PROVIDERS THAT SERVE THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT AROUND THE IVIES PURCHASING AN EYELINER COMMENTS WITH THE PEN.

THANK YOU THANK YOU. SMALLER OF SOME OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES CALIFORNIA THIS IS UNRELATED TO THE VALUE BASED PROPOSAL BUT RELATED TO PROP. FIFTY SIX I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOUBLE PROP FIFTY SIX THING. BUT AS DISCUSSED DURING FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH HEARING WE SUPPORT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT BUT REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS -- PROPOSING THAT IT ALSO WOULD BE INVESTED IN FAMILY PLANNING RELATEDPROCEDURES EDUCATION AND COUNSELING AND OTHER SPECIFIC HIGH SERVICE NEEDS LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ISSUE. AND JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A QUICK UPDATE SINCE I WAS HEARD SO. SO EARLY IN THE PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN I THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION -- ON ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN DH CS STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS. WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM APPS ME THE MEDI CAL? ICAL INTERPRETERS PILOT PROGRAM. MADAM CHAIR MISTER WOULD -- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE NOT HERE RIGHT NOW -- BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES -- AND WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL -- TO YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR H. AND ON THE TH AND IN THE EYES AND THIS -- CRITICAL STATE CALLED A REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION -- WE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY YEARS TO LAUNCH A PILOT PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA STUDY THE COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS -- WELL KNOWN DEFICIENCIES IN LIVERY OF MEDICARE -- MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES -- IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM -- DOING OUR WORK DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUDGET PROCESS ON THIS ISSUE. A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE LEADERS AND CONSTITUENCY CAUCUSES -- WERE CLEARED AND NOT ONLY DID STAGE STATE LEGISLATORS -- UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE BUT INTENDED TO ACTIVELY WORK WITH US AND OTHERS IN THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY. TO STUDY THE EXTENT OF LACK OF ACCESS TO INTERPRETATION SERVICES AND TO WORK TO IMPLEMENT POLICY. AND HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD PROVIDE AND EVALUATE THE PROVISION OF IN PERSON MEDICAL INTERPRETER SERVICES -- WILD THIS STATUE SLATED TO GO INTO EFFECT ON JAN WHERE ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DID NOT RELEASE AN RP INTO APRIL -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE THE PARCHMENT WASN'T ABLE. TO SELECT A VICE A VENDOR TO CONDUCT THE STUDY UNTIL DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY FINALIZE AN AGREEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR -- BUT GIVING THE GIVEN THE STATUES EXPLORATION IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY WE RECENTLY CONCERNED AT THIS LEAVE VIRTUALLY NO TIME TO CONDUCT AN ADEQUATE AND LEGITIMATE PILOT PROJECT -- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERPRETATION OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE PREVENTS US FROM ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROJECT UNTIL THE STUDY IS COMPLETE -- WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR WORK EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE FUNDS FOR BOTH THE STUDY AND THE PILOT PROJECT THAT WAS ALLOCATED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ON THE STUDY PORTION OF THE STATUTE ALONE -- SO WE ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH THE REQUEST FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME THAT FOR FEELS WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT -- WITH THE PREVIOUS STATUE AND ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL PILOT PROJECT THAT IS PROPERLY FUNDED -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ADEQUATE -- FUNDS AVAILABLE -- TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DO A PROPER EVALUATION OF LACK OF ACCESS IN THIS COMMUNITY SO -- WE WERE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION -- TO BEGIN -- TO IMPLEMENT POLITICS AND STATE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTION COMMENT. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR CALL WAY YET. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS TO TO TO THE COMMITTEE. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHAT'S IS IT FOR THE THE MONEY WAS PUT THERE FOR THE STUDY AND OF THE PILOT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH THE STUDY IN THE PILOT. AND I KNOW THAT -- PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS IS A BIG ADVOCATE OF THIS MAKING SURE THAT THE INTENTION WITH THE INTENT. OF HER LEGISLATION BECOME WE CAN BE COMPLETED AND THAT THE PILOT TO BE FUNDED SO THAT. WHATEVER WAS FOUND IN THE STUDY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS REIMBURSEMENT CODES. THAT'S A MOUTHFUL KEY PIECE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THAT MEANS YOU ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LESS DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME WHEN WHEN WE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ABLE GRANT I'M WHICH ALCHEMY IS WE ARE THE MAKER OF LONG ATING INJECTABLE NOT TRACKS ON ORDER THE TROLL -- THE PROS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS FOR BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE THAT DOES TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE IT PROVIDES AUTHORITY AND DIRECTION FOR DH CS TO PROVIDE. REIMBURSEMENT CODE CREATION AND RATE SETTING FOR NECESSARY PATIENT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ALL MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS IN NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND T. PIECE. SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR LAST YEAR. NUMBER TWO EIGHT REQUEST DH CS TO IDENTIFY FUNDING NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT PATIENT SUPPORT SUCH A PSYCHO SOCIAL SERVICES ESTING AND PROVIDER FEES AND ADVISED THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE ON HOW MUCH FUNDING IN IN FACT IS NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS PROCESS. INITIAL ESTIMATES WERE FOR NOMINAL FINDINGS BUT DH CS HAS SUGGESTED THAT LACK OF FUNDING IS THE SECOND REASON THAT THIS HAS NOT MOVED FORWARD. WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT STATED GOAL OF EXPANDING MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THE DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY HAS AWARDED A STATE OPIATE RESPONSE GRANT FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING. TO AND TEEPEES THE FACILITIES WERE SPEAKING OUT TODAY TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO USE MATT AND SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING NOT TRUCKS ON THE GOAL OF EXPANDING CAPACITY TO USE THE MEDICATION WHEN THERE'S NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE SERVICES ASSOCIATED SIMPLY DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. WE NEED THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT IS TRAINING PROVIDERS TO USE NO TRACKS ON AND SPENDING STATE DOLLARS TO EXPAND CAPACITY FOR THE HOUSTON ALL TRUCKS ON THAT PROVIDERS ARE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE RELATED TO PRESCRIBING UP TRUCKS ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS NOT IT WAS A GREAT PRESENTATION LOOK NO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS C. R. C.'S GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS SORT OF ANALOGOUS TO A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE FAMILY CARE GIVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH MANY TASKS BEFORE THEM -- MY NAME IS KATHY KELLY I'M DIRECTOR OF FAMILY CAREGIVER ALLIANCE AND ALSO THE BAY AREA CARE GIVER -- RESOURCE CENTER AND I'M SPEAKING. ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CENTERS. ARE TO SUPPORT -- THIS REQUEST -- OF FOR UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S PARKINSON'S STROKE AND OTHER BRAIN IMPAIRMENTS. FOR A ONE TIME BUDGET INCREASE OF TEN MILLION PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO EXPAND. AND RETOOL THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND COMPLEXITY OF CARE THAT FAMILY CARE GIVERS ARE ALREADY PROVIDING. FAMILY CAREGIVERS REALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. BUT WE SEE SOME SUN SETTLING TRENDS ON BEFORE US THEY'RE GETTING YOUNGER MORE DIVERSE I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED AND HAVE CHILDREN IN THE HOME. MOST OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE SEE ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT ARE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE THERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE. FOR A SERVICES FOR THE EITHER THEMSELVES OR FOR THEIR LOVED ONES -- BUT NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES PRIVATELY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE FIVE MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS THAT ARE PROVIDING COMPLEX CARE ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING. SKILLED ASSISTED LIVING AND NURSING HOME CARE IN THEIR HOMES BUT WITHOUT THE TRAINING GUIDANCE INSURANCE THEY THAT THEY ARE DOING AT THE CARE TASK CORRECTLY AND THAT WE SUPPORT THEM EMOTIONALLY AND DOING THEM. THIS REQUEST DOES TWO THINGS FIRST THE DRAMATICALLY RAMPS UP DIRECT SERVICES TO FAMILY CARE GIVERS. BY WORKING TOWARDS TRIPLING THE NUMBER OF CARE GIVERS RECEIVING CAREPLANNING AND COACHING EDUCATION COUNSELING SKILL TRAINING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS. AND CONSUMER DIRECTED RESPITE SERVICES AND THIS IS FOR A POINT FROM OUR CURRENT BASELINE OF A LITTLE BIT UNDER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE. A STATE SYSTEM OF ELEVEN I CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS. WE ARE PROPOSED DOING THIS THROUGH A HYBRID OF PERSONAL CONTACT IN SMART USE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN SCALE SERVICES ONLINE AND THREE TELEHEALTH MEANS TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES. BUT ALSO MAKE ACCESSING SERVICES EASIER FOR WORKING AN ISOLATED CARE GIVERS. AND MAKING IT MORE GENERATIONALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE ARE YOUNGER CARE GIVERS THAT WE SERVE. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS IN THE DATA CAPABILITIES TO TRACK CARE GIVER AND YOUR RECEIVER NEEDS. THROUGH UNIFORMS SAUCE WITH THE PROVIDES DATA DATA TO TAILOR TRAINING SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS. AND RESULTING IN MEASURES -- THAT -- POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE MEASURABLE. WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM RUNNING IN LOS ANGELES ON ALSO IN THE BAY AREA SO IT IS ALREADY PILOT TESTED AND IS READY FOR REPLICATION. THIS REQUEST IS TO BUILD REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPABILITIES OF THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER SYSTEM TO SUPPORT. FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE -- THAT HAS REALLY BEEN MISSING SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IS A KEY RECOMMENDATION -- FOR OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA CARE GIVER TASK FORCE REPORT AND IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE PROPOSED MASTER PLAN ON AGING -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST THANK YOU. QUESTION SIX JUST A COMMENT I JUST WANT TO SAY I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE I THINK -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED IN ONCE AGAIN AND ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF OF THE BUDGET CUTS THAT WE WENT THROUGH -- PROVIDING TRAINING AND SUPPORT AND RESPITE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR FAMILIES -- KEEP THEM OUT OF MORE EXPENSIVE CARE IS THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT WE NEED MORE MORE OF THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM AUDIOLOGY POSITION. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT'S THE LEGACY -- CRANKS WITH SACRAMENTO ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF AUDIOLOGY WHICH REPRESENTS STATE LICENSE AUDIOLOGIST. CALIFORNIA AUDIOLOGIST HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE H. C. S. S. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES OR CCS PROGRAM FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES DECADES PROVIDING DIAGNOSTIC AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID FITTING SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH HEARING LOSS -- WHOSE PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THEMSELVES. UNFORTUNATELY A SERIES OF LONG STANDING CONCERNS WITH C. C. AS PROGRAMS HAS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF AUDIOLOGIST HAVE BEEN FORCED TO WITHDRAW AS PROVIDERS FROM THE PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS AMONG THEM FOR AN INSUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT RATES DELAYS AN AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN TREATMENTS JEOPARDIZING VITAL EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS. AND INEFFICIENCIES BETWEEN AUDIOLOGIST AND PERSONNEL AT THE CCS PROGRAM THE IMPACT IS VERY REAL. LOSING QUALIFIED CCS PROVIDERS EXACERBATES EXISTING PROBLEMS AROUND ACCESS. TO APPROPRIATE CARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY MANY OF THE CCS PROVIDER OFFICE. OFFICE IS THAT CAN PROVIDE SERVICES DO NOT. WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE DATA AND CALLED ALL SEVENTY TWO CCS LISTED OFFICES THAT HAVE AUDIOLOGY TESTING AND HEARING AID SERVICES FOR CHILDREN FIVE YEARS AND OLDER. WE LEARNED THAT OF THE SEVENTY TWO CURRENTLY LISTED PROVIDERS ONLY TWENTY ARE STILL PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. THIS UNSUSTAINABLE SHORTAGE OF IDEOLOGICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IN PARTICULARLY IS TROUBLING BECAUSE THERE ARE NEARLY SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO SUFFER FROM HEARING LOSS WITHOUT ADEQUATE INTERVENTION HEARING LOSS CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF AUDIOLOGY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST BE ESTABLISHMENT OF A POSITION WITH ANTI. H. C. S. TO SERVE AS A LIAISON BETWEEN DEPARTMENT PROBE PROGRAM OUT. AN AUDIOLOGIST PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MEDI CAL. AIR AMBULANCE RATE INCREASE YOUR TURN. TO TAKE A BREAK. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL BRYANT -- I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. WHO -- PROVIDE A KEY -- ELEMENT TO THE EMS AND DISASTER RESPONSE SYSTEM -- OUR PROPOSAL IS TO ASK -- FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ON GOING FUNDING FOR AIR AMBULANCE MEDI CAL FUNDING. THIS WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT AMADA PROGRAM -- THAT'S EXPIRING THIS YEAR THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM IF YOU RECALL PLACED A FOUR DOLLAR PENALTY ON MOVING VIOLATIONS -- AND THAT PROGRAM IS -- SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR -- THE PROPOSAL -- RE BASES. THE ERR AMBULANCE RATES TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE RURAL MEDICARE RATE. WHICH REPRESENTS ROUGHLY -- TWO THIRDS OF THE ACTUAL ROCK ACOSTA PROVIDING THE SERVICE. THE REASON THIS IS SO NECESSARY IS THAT THE UNDERLYING BASE RATE FOR AIR AMBULANCES WAS LAST UPDATED IN -- NINETEEN NINETY THREE DUE TO ONE OVERSIGHT THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY IT WAS FURTHER REDUCED BY 10%. IN THAT TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SO -- WITHOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM WE REVERT BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY THREE RATES -- FINALLY AIR CARRIERS ARE -- ERR AMBULANCES ARE AIR CARRIERS. AND SO WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING A QUALITY ASSURANCE FEAR PROVIDER TAX -- AND WE ALSO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR DISH PAYMENTS EVEN THOUGH LIKE HOSPITALS ARE EVEN THOUGH UP 270% OF OUR PATIENTS -- CAN BE COVERED BY MEDICARE. SO WITH THAT I A WILL -- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. COULD I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. COUNTY OF RESIDENCE PROCESS. MADAM CHAIR AND PULLING MEASURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES WE HAVE FOUR PROPOSALS HERE AND I WOULD LOOK TO YOU TO ADVISE AND HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH THEM. WHY DON'T WE DO BRIEF PRESENTATION ON EACH? ONE SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE -- COUNTY OF SERVICE -- AND THIS IS A PROPOSAL WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO USE ITS OVERSIGHT -- FUNCTION -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN A DISPUTE BETWEEN -- THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE ADD THAT HAVE. RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO ACCESS TO CARE -- AND THIS IS A DISPUTED IS CENTERED AND BARRIERS CREATED BY THE REALIGNMENT ROLLS. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE -- IN DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING -- SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS REMAIN WHICH CREATE BARRIERS TO CARE. FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF A COUNTY ESTABLISHES A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVIDER OUTSIDE THE COUNTY BORDERS. THOSE WHO SEE CARE FOR AS YOU DE. IN ANOTHER COUNTY STILL CONNECTED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE OR MEDICATION NEEDS MET IN THAT CASE IN COUNTY. SO IN IT SO THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE IN TWO COUNTIES AND EVEN THOUGH A PROVIDER MIGHT BE CLOSER. THE ACCOUNT THE PROVIDER THIS IN ANOTHER COUNTY THEY'D STILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEIR OWN COUNTY. WHICH AND TRAVEL FURTHER AND IN SOME CASES TO OBTAIN THE SERVICE. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO HELP US SO RESOLVE THIS SO WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WITH THE COUNTIES ABOUT THIS. AND OUR RECOMMENDATION IS PERHAPS A SOME SORT OF EITHER BUDGET BILLING WHICH A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD WITHHOLD FUNDS FROM COUNTIES. AND CONDUCT A SETTLEMENT PROCESS OR SETTLEMENT AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR OR REQUIRE COUNTIES TO RECOGNIZE AND PAY FOR OUT OF COUNTY SERVICES SO -- THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL. DO WE KNOW IT [inaudible] THANK YOU -- I'D LIKE TO THEM ON THE BACK TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL. THE TALKS SERVICE HEART RATE ON THREE FOR MANY YEARS -- THE STATE PAID -- FOR DETOXIFICATION SERVICES IN BOTH US DECERTIFIED PROGRAMS AND IN FREE STATE STANDING PSYCHIATRIC. HOSPITALS -- WITH THE ADVENT OF THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM -- THE STATE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE ONLY GOING TO PAY -- FOR DETOXIFICATION SERVICES IN -- STATE CERTIFIED HOSPITALS -- AND THAT THE COUNTY SHOULD PAY FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC FREESTANDING SAID FOR THE D. TAX IN THIS THE VIETNAM FREESTANDING PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS -- AND THE COUNTY SAID IT WAS A PART OF THEIR DRUG MEDI CAL ODS -- ALLOCATION -- THEREFORE THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR IT -- SO -- THE REQUESTED FUNDING IS -- BASED ON A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ABUSING OPIATES ALONE. 1% REQUIRES THAT A SAM THREE POINT SEVEN LEVEL HOSPITAL DETOXIFICATION WHICH CAN BE PROVIDED IN -- ALL ALL THESE SO -- HOSPITAL SITUATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN MENTIONING. THESE ARE LARGELY INDIVIDUALS A WHOLE -- WITH SIRIUS CO OCCURRING DISORDERS AND OR MEDICALLY COMPROMISED AND THEY TEND TO BE THE HIGHEST UTILIZES EMERGENCY ROOM CARE AND A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OVERDOSE CASES. IF ALCOHOL IS INCLUDED THE NUMBER WOULD -- DRAMATICALLY INCREASE. AT AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY OF FIVE DAYS IN AN AVERAGE RATE PER DAY OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -- PER DAY THE FUNDING REQUEST IS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- THE ONE OPTION IN MANAGING THESE FUNDS WOULD BE TO ALLOCATED RETAIN THE FUNDS AT THE STATE LEVEL BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND COUNTIES COULD DRIVE DOWN ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS. BASED ON THE THIS DRIVE DOWN COULD BE FURTHER COULD EITHER BE COUNTY BY COUNTY BASED OR PROVIDER CLAIM OR DH YES COULD PAY. CLAIMS DIRECTLY -- TO PROVIDERS. THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ALLOCATE -- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND IN TURN HAVE THE DEPARTMENT -- ALLOCATE THE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES FOR THEM TO MANAGE -- IN ANY EVENT THE DEMAND IS BELOW THE FUNDING IF THE IF THE DEMAND IS BELOW THE FUNDING LEVEL REQUESTED THE BALLOTS COULD BRAWL FORWARD. AND BE REASSESSED BASED ON INCREASING AND OR DECREASING THE SO THAT IS OUR OUR REQUEST -- FOR I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE -- BECAUSE OF THIS REALLY BLOCKAGE TO ACCESS TO CARE. A SOME OF OUR PROVIDERS HAVE HAD PEOPLE DIED WAITING -- FOR IT A BIT TO GET INTO DETOXIFICATION. SO -- VERY CRITICAL AND IT'S A IT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THE FIRST STEP IN ACCESSING SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND HAVING PEOPLE GET OUT TO THE ROAD TO RECOVERY SO THAT CONCLUDES THAT. PROPOSAL THANK YOU. ARE THERE PROPOSAL AGAIN IS A A PROPOSAL -- MORE OF ASKING THE COMMITTEE -- TO ADVOCATE FOR BRIDGE HOUSING -- THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR DRUG MEDI CAL ODS -- SERVICES -- AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR A RECOVERING HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MEET THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESS. THESE -- THIS INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED SUPPORT OF HOUSING AS A TUITION TRANSITION FROM PRISON RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES AND THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY. WE AND WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE I SURE THAT THE BRIDGE HOUSING FUNDING AS YOU. GO THROUGH AND DO THE ALLOCATION OF THE HOMELESS FINDING THAT BRIDGE HOUSING IS INCLUDED IN THAT HOUSING AND SOMETIMES IT GETS FORGOTTEN SO THAT THEIR SECOND PROPOSAL AND THERE HAS BEEN. PARDON THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION. OF ABOUT BRIDGE YOU HOUSING. IN. IN MANY SITUATIONS AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN OUR FOURTH PROPOSAL IS -- WORK FOR AS EXPANSION. AND IT'S A LITTLE MORE EXPANDED THEN THE PROPOSAL'S YOU HAD pEARLIER UNDER THE I SHOULD PROPOSAL -- OUR WORK FIRST PROPOSAL IS FOR A THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AS YOU'VE HEARD -- EARLIER AND AS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED ANOTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS THAT. THE SUBSTANCE USE WORKFORCE IS -- A TOTALLY -- AND IN NEED OF BOTH -- A RECRUITMENT AS WELL AS TRAINING AND IMPROVING AND STRENGTHENING THE WORK FOR SYSTEM. WE WOULD -- FUNDING SHOULD BE -- YOUR MARKED UP FOR TUITION SUPPORT TO INCREASE WORKFORCE FOR CERTIFIED COUNSELORS AND EXPAND. A TRAINING FOR CURRENT WORK FOR START UP FUNDS TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE. AS YOU DECALS ARE EDUCATION TOWARD CERTIFICATION -- THERE ARE -- ONLY THREE ARE CERTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE COUNSELOR CERTIFICATION RIGHT NOW. AND WE WOULD -- PARTLY ASK FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FEASIBILITY OF BRINGING DOES CERTIFICATION PROCESS BACK IN UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE RATHER THAN DELEGATING IT -- TO OUTSIDE NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS -- SHOWS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION WOULD BE FIVE MILLION FOR TUITION SUPPORT. OF FIVE MILLION FOR CURRENT WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDS. A THREE MILLION UP POSSIBLY THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS TO PROVIDE START UP RESOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. TO ENTER AND MEET THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES REQUIREMENTS. TO BECOME APPROVED COUNSELOR EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS NON GOVERNMENTAL -- CERTIFICATION UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT WE COULD GET THE MAKE AN ASSESSMENT IS TO BRING THAT CERTIFICATION PROCESS BACK INTO THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE -- THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO EVALUATE HOW -- TO REDUCE THE DUPLICATIVE UNCOORDINATED. AND OFTEN UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND BURDENS PLACED I'M PROVIDERS -- WE OFTEN HAVE DUBBED DUPLICATE WORK TO DO DOUBLE DUPLICATE ENTRY -- BY -- COUNSELORS -- DO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DUPLICATE ENTRIES AND OF VARIOUS FORMS -- TO MEET FEDERAL STATE AND COUNTY REQUIREMENTS SO -- SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE A SINGLE STATE AGENCY TAKING OVER THE CERTIFICATION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESS OF AS YOU G. COUNCIL CERTIFICATION. WITH A REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. I THANK THANK YOU. FROM THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. ASSOCIATION HIGH COST DRUGS D. R. G. CARVE OUT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MAYOR MARTIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS ASSOCIATION I HERE WITH KIND OF A NEW ONCE ISSUE RELATED TO HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT -- WHEN YOU HAVE A FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL PATIENT WITH THE HIGH COST DRUG? SO CURRENTLY WHEN A FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL PATIENT IS ADMINISTERED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG ON AN INPATIENT BASIS THE HOSPITAL IS REIMBURSED WITH A BUNDLE PAYMENT CALL THE DRG. WHICH IS MEANT TO COVERAGE THE AVERAGE COST ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING SOMEONE WITH THAT CONDITION INCLUDING THE COST OF ANY MEDICATIONS. HOWEVER WHEN A VERY NEW HIGH COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ADMINISTERED TO A PATIENT ON AN INPATIENT BASIS THAT THE R. G. DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF THE DRUG BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE COST. OF THE PREVIOUS STANDARD OF CARE. IN ADDITION SOMETIMES YOU HAVE HIGH COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS BUT OCCASIONALLY A CHILD WILL HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE REIMBURSEMENT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- THE COST OF THE DRUG AS PART OF THE DEAR G. PAYMENT IN BOTH CASES A HOSPITAL WILL LOSE SIGNIFICANT -- FINANCIAL. EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES CURRENTLY YOU CAN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE CO -- ONE OFF CARVE OUT OF THE DRUG PAYMENT AND WE ACTUALLY DID THIS LAST YEAR FOR A DRUG CALLED HIM RIGHT TO TREAT A RARE TYPE OF LEUKEMIA -- ONLY ABOUT TWENTY KIDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED IT I THINK ABOUT TEN OF THEM WERE IN MEDI CAL -- BUT ANY TIME HOSPITAL HAD ONE OF THOSE KIDS GET ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WAS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR LOSS TO THE HOSPITAL THE DEPARTMENT AGREED THAT THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE THE AGREE TO CARVE THE DRUG OUT OF THE DRG PAYMENTS. ABOUT THAT PROCESS TOOK FIFTEEN MONTHS FROM THE MOMENT WE FIRST MENTIONED IT TO THE DEPARTMENT SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. IS TO CREATE A DEFINITION OF A VERY HIGH COST DRUGS AND TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT JUST CREATE A PROCESS. TO GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE THESE CARVE OUTS IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR A STAKEHOLDER TO COMMON RAISE THE ISSUE -- SO THAT THAT HAPPENS FASTER AND YOU DON'T HAVE HOSPITAL'S EXPERIENCING THE LOSS IN THE MEANTIME. THANK YOU AND BUT NO DON'T GO AWAY. BECAUSE I DID -- TO MISTER PATTERSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON DID HAVE. SOME COMMENTS THAT HE WANTED TO SHARE -- HE DID HAVE TO LEAVE. AND SO ON HIS BEHALF THESE ARE HIS WORDS OKAY. THEY'RE ALL GOOD WORDS BUT THESE ARE HIS WORDS -- MOST PATTERSON SAYS IT FROM HIS UNDERSTANDING WE'RE EXPOSING HOSPITALS TO ALL KINDS OF UNANTICIPATED FINANCIAL LOSSES IF WE DON'T CARVE OUT THESE DRUGS. HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE LAST THING WE SHOULD. BE DOING IS TO PUT HOSPITALS IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE FACTORING THE HIGH COST OF THESE DRUGS. WHEN DETERMINING IF THEY SHOULD ADMINISTER SOMETHING THAT IS POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING TO A PATIENT? MR PATERSON CONCLUDES BY SAYING THIS CAR ABOUT PROCESS IS ALREADY BEING DONE AND THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO BE PROACTIVE ABOUT IDENTIFYING. THESE DRUGS SO THAT HOSPITALS AREN'T LEFT FOOTING THE BILL. SOMETIMES FOR LONGER THAN A YEAR ON SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED QUICKLY. THOSE ARE MISTER PATTERSON'S COMMENTS THAT HE WANTED TO SHARE. ON THIS ITEM BUT HAD TO LEAVE. THANK YOU SO THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. MEDICAL COVERAGE OF SILVER DYE MINE FLUORIDE [inaudible] WELCOME. HI GOOD AFTERNOON BRANDED HIM IN SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION -- CD IS RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING BUDGET -- BUDGET FUNDING TO MAKE SILVER DINING FLUORIDE EIGHT MEDI CAL -- COVERED BENEFIT STF IS A TOPICAL LIQUID AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY PAINTED ON TEETH AND IT'S USED TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP. DECAY IN BOTH BABY AND PERMANENT TEETH. IT'S A NON INVASIVE NON INVASIVE WAY TO TREAT DENTAL CARIES KNOWN AS CAVITIES AND IT CAN REDUCE THE NEED FOR FURTHER FILLINGS OR THE USE OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA. AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL IN THE CARE OF PEOPLE DISABILITIES FRAIL ELDERLY PATIENTS YOUNG CHILDREN AND INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS -- IN ORDER TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE POPULATIONS THAT WOULD MOST BENEFIT FROM STF WE REALLY DID FOCUS ON THOSE POPULATIONS THAT I JUST LISTED. IT DOES LEAVE A DARK STAIN ON THE CAVITY -- AND THE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND I CAN STAY IN THE STOP SOFT TISSUE LIKE THE GUMS TEMPORARILY WHICH IS WHY ALL OF OUR DENTIST USE I'M STRONG INFORMED CONSENT AND REALLY TALK THROUGH. SOME OF THE OPTIONS IT REALLY IS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THEY TALK TO THE OPTIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND. SORT OF WHT THEY'RE CHOOSING I'M IN DESPITE THE AESTHETIC CONCERNS IT'S REALLY BECOMING VERY WIDELY USED IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IS PAYING FOR IT. AND WHEN IT'S NOT COVERED FAMILIES ARE P. CHOOSING TO PAY OUT OF POCKET -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL -- IT MAYBE FINANCIALLY OUT OF REACH -- FOR FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES. AND WE'RE REALLY HEARING FROM OUR MEMBER DENNIS THAT THEY'RE USING IT ON A WIDE RANGE OF PATIENTS AND IN A WIDE RANGE OF SETTINGS. ONE OF OUR DENTIST SAID RECENTLY THAT SHE USED IT I'M IN THE SAME DAY ON A TWO YEAR OLD AND A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD. THE TWO YEAR OLD HAD A BABY BOTTLE TO K. BETWEEN THIS TO UPPER FRONT TEETH. AND WHILE HIS PARENTS WERE INITIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BLACK SIDE EFFECTS WHEN THEY REALLY CONSIDERED BOTH THE COST DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THE SORT OF TRADITIONAL TREATMENT. THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED IT NITROUS OXIDE GAS INJECTABLE ANESTHETICS AND POSSIBLY SERVE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE -- THE PARENTS DECIDED THAT I STAFF WAS REALLY THE THE WAY TO GO AND THE DENNIS IS GOING TO BE WORKING ON SORT OF AESTHETIC COVER UP SAYS AS HE HAS THE CHILD GETS OLDER. THE NINETY TWO YEAR OLD HAD DEMENTIA AND AND HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING HIS TEETH CLEAN AGAIN SIMILAR DECISIONS WERE MADE TO SORT OF AVOID THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT -- AND SO. ESSENTIALLY THIS BUDGET ASK WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THIS -- ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS AND DONE A CAL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL IN THE FINAL BUDGET. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PROPOSAL. PACE MODERNIZATION ACT TRAILER BILL. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL WITH CAL PACE WE REPRESENT THE PROGRAMS OF ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY -- THIS PRO PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY FOR PACE PROGRAMS -- AS YOU KNOW PACES A COMPREHENSIVE CARE MODEL SERVING FOR ALL SENIORS AND OLDER ADULTS. IT ASSUMES -- THE ENTIRE RISK OF PROVIDING THE ALL THE SERVICES THAT THE SENIORS NEED TO STAY SAFE WHEN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT INCLUDES ACUTE CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND HOME CARE AND SO FORTH -- THE PROPOSAL WOULD BETTER ALIGN THE METHODOLOGY WITH -- SOME OF THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF PACE ONE IS THAT IT'S A VERY CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF INVESTMENT ON THE FRONT END I PAY CENTER GENERALLY COST TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- TO START UP IN A COMMUNITY. AND THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO RECOGNIZE THOSE COSTS AND ALLOW THEM TO BE RECOUPED IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. THIS IS ALSO A VERY BALL LITTLE PROGRAM -- SERVING A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF REALLY HIGH NEED -- BENEFICIARIES SO -- THE PROGRAMS NEED A LITTLE BIT HIGHER MARGIN TO HANDLE THE SITUATION THAT ARISES WHEN. THEY HAVE A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE SUCH AS HEPATITIS C. OR OR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AND SO THE METHODOLOGY CHANGES WOULD ADDRESS THAT AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE. SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE METHODOLOGY RECOGNIZING THE ACTUAL COSTS OF STARTUP PROGRAMS -- AND UNFORTUNATELY METHODOLOGY TENDS TO USE COST EXPERIENCE OF ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS -- FOR NEW PROGRAMS BUT THEY THEY JUST HAVE HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS -- WHEN THEY STERN SO THAT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS THERE ARE SO? THE METHODOLOGY -- CHANGES WOULD MAKE A SEVERAL CHANGES THESE WOULD HELP ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACE THIS IS A VERY PROMISING MODEL I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF IT IN YOUR AREA -- IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE MODEL CAN BE CARRIED ON INTO INTO THE FUTURE. AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY EVEN WITH THESE CHANGES -- INCLUDING A MINIMUM PAYMENT STANDARD -- BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS HAVE TO BE SET BELOW THE AMOUNT THE STATE WOULD OTHERWISE PAY -- PACE WILL REMAIN WOULD REMAIN ACOSTA DOCTOR PROGRAM FOR THE STATE -- WE ARE ENGAGED AND FAIRLY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- WE'RE WE DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING AT REFINING THE PROPOSAL -- WE'VE HAD SOME PROGRESS AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT DOES AGREE WITH US AND CONCEPT ON A FEW THE FEW THE CONCEPTS ANYWAY. SO WE ARE HOPEFUL AT SOME POINT WILL HAVE -- A MORE REFINED PROPOSAL AND HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AT THAT TIME. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING. HOUSE MY PREVENTION AND MEDI CAL.

OF THOSE ONE IN SIX EXPERIENCED TRAUMA CHILDHOOD ABUSE NEGLECT OR DEMENTIA RESULTING IN ANXIETY DEPRESSION PS TV. AND SOMETIMES SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. TODAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNTREATED THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE ELDERS WHO HAVE BEEN SERVING OUR COMMUNITY. AND END UP IN AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITY SETTING. THAT 45% POPULATION OFTEN RESULTS IN -- A SIZEABLE POPULATION OF HOMELESSNESS APPROXIMATELY 66% OF THE MEDICARE RECIPIENTS IN NURSING HOMES ARE ON THE LOG FOR HOMELESS AND ARE MOVING IN AND OUT BETWEEN. THE ACUTE SETTING -- UNDER THE NEW LAW THAT CAN THE PLACE FOR THE NURSING ARTS COMMITTEE EMERGENCY ROOM MUST REQUIRE AND PROVIDE CHAIR FOOD WATER AND CLOTHING. THEN THE DISCHARGED IN THE NURSING HOME THE NURSING HOME THEN BECOMES A TEMPORARY HOUSING ARRANGEMENT FOR THOSE PATIENTS AS OPPOSED TO GOING BACK TO THE STREET -- ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE THAT -- RESULT IS INCARCERATION WE SEE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ALMOST PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THE NURSING HOME LINING UP INCARCERATIONS. EPISODES OF VIOLENCE UP TO SUICIDE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY SUICIDE RATES ARE CLIMBING IN ABOUT TWO POINT 2% OF THE NURSING HOME POPULATIONS.

IS A NO COST PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRANSFER MONEY THROUGH THEY GET BACK. THROUGH G. D.. DH CS TO CD BUT TO START UP THE PROGRAM WHICH IS AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH THIS WOULD BE ONE TIME APPROPRIATION -- TO SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE OTHER BUDGET CYCLE FOR THIS. CALIFORNIA IS FORTY EIGHT IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE GET BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. WE ARE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICE. FULL HEATH WITHIN THEIR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE CAN'T FIND ANOTHER STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME COORDINATION. SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE SAYING THEY NEED THIS SO THEY HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO IMPLEMENT THESE SOMETIMES VERY TECHNICAL PROGRAMS IN THE SCHOOLS. AND LASH OF LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AN AUDIT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS. AND THEY REALLY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS A WAY THEY AND HELP FROM. WITHIN THE EDUCATION STRUCTURE THAT WOULD -- REALLY ALLEVIATED AND WE'RE JUST MOVING NOW TOWARDS A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT WILL ALLOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLANS WITHIN THE SCHOOLS. AND THE SCHOOLS REALLY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE AND WITH THAT. LYDIA WILL FINISH MY THIRTY ONE WITHOUT CALTRANS THIRTY ONE SECONDS -- OKAY FINE THIS THIS WE SEE THIS AS A NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SET UP A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP. CURRENTLY AS HELEN ST WE DO NOT HAVE ONE WE ALSO BELIEVE WITH THAT COLLABORATION WE WILL START TO SEE. OUR TECH MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUT REACH AND COORDINATION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE SCHOOLS -- WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WITH THIS -- MEAGER AMOUNT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WE CAN GET THE SEED MONEY TO PUT IN PLACE THIS DEPARTMENT. ARE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- AND SO WE ASKED WE SUPPORT FOR THIS SONG THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU THAT I MAKING ANY ONE SECOND. SIX TO RESET IT SO I ASSUME YES OTHERWISE YOU WOULD PUT A LITTLE SIGN. THANK YOU FOR THE PROPOSAL I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S DOES APPEAR LIKE SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT TO SET UP A DEPARTMENT IN OFFICES SCHOOL BASED HEALTH. THIS ON GOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR TO HAVE THIS OFFICE SO IT'S REALLY JUST. GETTING THE STAFF IN PLACE YOU CAN USE VISITING EDUCATORS WHO WILL COME IN AND TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN THEY WILL GO BACK TO THEIR DISTRICTS TO SET IT UP SO IT'S JUST THAT ONE YEAR COST OF GETTING IN PLACE. ON GOING IT'S PAID FOR IT'S NOT THE BILL'S ALREADY OVER IN THE SENATE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH A FISCAL COMMITTEE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SCHOOL. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP.

DIRECTLY IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS PLACES AND NURSING HOMES. FOR THE VIRTUAL DOWN HOME TO ACHIEVE THE POTENTIAL INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW IS NEEDED. THE TECHNICAL FIX THAT WE SEE TO ADVANCE WOULD MAKE CLEAR THE INTENT OF AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR BY SPECIFYING THAT HEALTH CENTERS CAN ESTABLISH A PATIENT. USING STORE AND FORWARD TELE DENTISTRY.

WHICH HAS DEVELOPED A PROVEN EVIDENCE BASED SYSTEM OF PARENT TEEN SUPPORT. DESIGNED TO CREATE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN TEENAGERS FAMILIES AT THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY AND COMMUNITY LEVEL. WITH THE EIGHT MILLION WE CONSERVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES OKAY SO ASSUMING TWO KIDS PER FAMILY THAT'S TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS. THAT CAN POSSIBLY BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. NOW FQHCS ARE AN IDEAL SETTING DELIVER TO DELIVER PARENT TEEN INFORMATION. THEY HAVE INCREASED THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN FAMILIES THAT ARE ROUTINELY SEEN THERE AND THE LOGIC IS THERE RIGHT WITH TIGHTER INTEGRATION HE PROVIDE ADDED VALUE TO PATIENT VISITS. ABLE TO CATCH PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY ESCALATE AND OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT TO DEAL WITH COMMUNITY PROBLEMS LATER TO DEAL A CHILD MALTREATMENT LATER TO DEAL WITH CHILD TRAUMA LATER. IN PRACTICE FQHCS. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS TO PARENTS AND THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES. THERE IS A WIDENING GAP BIG BETWEEN BEST PRACTICES AND STANDARDS OF CARE -- FOR EXAMPLE FOR WORKING WITH THE KIDS WITH ADHD OR SOME KIND OF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR PROBLEM. SO PEDIATRICIAN CELL PSYCHOLOGISTS OR LAST FORTY YEARS HAVE DEVELOPED NINE DRUG EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS THEY WORK BUT WE ARE STILL FACED WITH THE PROBLEM WITH ACCESS AND AND AND THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ACCESS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. FAMILY SEE THEIR DOCTOR IN PETER P. A. BECAUSE THEY TRUST THEM THEY GET TREATMENT IN REFERRAL INFORMATION AT THESE FQHCS WITHOUT THAT TRUST. THEY ARE LEFT TO SORT THROUGH LIKE TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION HITS ON GOOGLE ABOUT HOW TO GET HELP FOR PARENT TEEN. OKAY SO THIS PROPOSAL EQUIPS PRIMARY CARE STOCKS WITH A GOOD REFERRAL EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT'S A HIGH STANDARD OF CARE AND FEEL TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT CONCLUDES. ISSUE NUMBER. FOURTEEN AND I WE WILL OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR DR WHAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS YOUR STAMINA.
