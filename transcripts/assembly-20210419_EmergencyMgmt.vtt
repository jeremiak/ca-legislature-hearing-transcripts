MANY OF THESE AREAS ARE ARE

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.072
LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES IN

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.207
THE WAKE OF THESE DISASTERS AND

MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE TAX

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:21.305
BIT OF CONCERN IS THE WROTE

DIRT- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:30.207
WE'VE GOT A REALLY POOR TRACK

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:32.576
RECORD. WHEN WE LEAVE THE

THIS COMMITTEE THAT WERE

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:41.618
ESTABLISHING- SO I GUESS. THE

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:42.786
OVER THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:43.487
HERE I'M START TO LOSE

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:44.688
CONFIDENCE WHEN WE'RE NOT A

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.790
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC IN OUR

SPENDING CHOICES RIGHT AND I

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:49.259
THINK WE'VE GOT A BUDGET

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.094
PROCESS TO DO THAT. WE

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:51.962

REGION EVERY COUNTY GETS THEIR

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:03.974
FAIR SHARE BECAUSE I JUST

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:06.610
THINK- IN RECENT MEMORY WE'VE

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.612
HAD. A RELATIVELY POOR TRACK

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:12.015
RECORD OF FOLLOWING THROUGH.

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:13.483
ASK THE TALKING POINTS OF A

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.185

YOU KNOW I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF

FAIRGROUNDS BUT WHEN I HAVE MY

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.831
CONCERN IS THAT SAYS THE- ALL

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:01.698
THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE A

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.800
BILLION DOLLAR GRANTS TO SMALL

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.369
COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS.

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.604
BLAH BLAH BLAH- FOR THOSE

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.406
GRANTS ARE THEY GOING TO DO

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.941
DOES THE COUNTIES HAVE TO MATCH

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:13.610
THOSE GRANTS AND IF SO THAT'S

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.279
IS VERY. TROUBLESOME TO ME

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.080
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:18.648
MONEY AND A LOT OF TIMES GRANTS

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:20.150
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A MATCH AND

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.485
SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:25.522
PIECE OF IT. WITHOUT ANY OTHER

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:28.258
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:29.793

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:32.596
FOR IT I MEAN THERE DEFINITELY

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:35.699
NEEDS TO BE- INVESTMENT IN

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.434
RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND I

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.602
THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WITH

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.871
THAT I WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.038
TASK FORCE I THINK THAT WOULD

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.173
BE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO WORK

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.641
WITH YOU TO ON. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.376
WHO SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF THAT

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.179
MY CONCERN ACTUALLY SEE SACK

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:51.615
NOTORIOUSLY BEEN NOT VERY GOOD

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:54.317

IS VERY MUCH. DOES A LOT OF

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.789
THINGS FOR URBAN COUNTIES BUT

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.123
RURAL COUNTIES OFTEN GET LEFT

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.859
BEHIND- AND THAT'S ONLY

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.661
CONTINUE TO BE MY EXPERIENCE

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.962

THEY'RE THE BEST ORGANIZATION-

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:13.103
TO BE ON THE OTHER BUT IT

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.871
OBVIOUSLY THAT THE INTENT HERE

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.807
IS TO GET TO SOMETHING THAT. IS

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.875

SO THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.325
CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY IN A

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.293
STATEWIDE PROGRAM ACTUALLY

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:10.794
WRITTEN OUT OF IT AT THE

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:16.099
BEGINNING- I WOULD SAY THAT MY

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:16.633
INTERPRETATION OF HOW THIS

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.604
WOULD APPLY. IS UNLESS YOU ARE

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.138
IF YOU ARE AN ACCOUNTING OF

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:24.975
THREE THOUSAND OR MORE. IF YOU

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:25.475
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FIRE

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:28.144
DISTRICT. OR A SMALL SPECIAL

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.980
DISTRICT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:32.082
ABLE TO APPLY BUT IT DOESN'T

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:35.785
APPLY TO BIG COUNTIES- SO WE'RE

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:36.953
ACTUALLY STARTED WITH THIS A

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.622
RISK CONSTRICTED UNIVERSAL WHO

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:40.457
WOULD BE THE ELIGIBLE COUNTIES

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:41.691
I REALLY WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:43.093
SURE THAT THE RESOURCE OF COAL

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:45.328
OR THE WEATHER INTENDED TO GO.

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:49.199
TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. ON

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:52.369
SAUDI TENDED. I ACTUALLY FEEL

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:53.904
THAT I'M OPEN ON THE GOVERNANCE

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.139
ISSUES I WOULD NOT WISH TO TAKE

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:56.740
A MOMENT HERE BUT I THINK THE

00:52:56.806 --> 00:53:01.511
GENERAL STRUCTURE IS ONE THAT-

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:02.612
WE USE OF SO MANY THINGS BUT I

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:04.781
THINK THE- THE SUBSTANCE OF.

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.550
THIS ACT WHICH LIMITS FOR THE

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.852
DOLLARS COULD FLOW. SO I'M LESS

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.887
CONCERNED ON THE ISSUE OF. WHO

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:14.324
DOES WHAT APPOINTMENTS- AND

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:17.327
THEN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:21.865
WAY THE LAW IS STRUCTURED. OF.

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:24.868
ASSEMBLY MAGYAR COREY OUR-

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.536
LOCAL AGES AWARD A GRANT OF

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.638
THIS CHAPTER. MAY ADDITIONALLY

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.073
LEVERAGE FEDERAL OR PRIVATE

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.241
FUNDING OR PRIVATE PUBLIC

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.343
PARTNERSHIPS TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:38.815
PROJECT THE GRANT WAS AWARDED.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:41.651
FOR THE FUNDS THAT'S GREAT. BUT

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.954
IT'S NOT IT'S LIKE THEY THEY

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.889
PUTS THE PROJECT AT A SHOVEL

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.023
READY THAT MEETS ONE OF THESE

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.025
CRITERIA. AND I DO THINK THAT

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:51.261
THERE'S ONGOING CONVERSATION

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.929
ABOUT SHOULD THERE BE. OUR

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.864
REFINEMENTS THAT BY TO COMPLAIN

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.233
WATER PROJECTS THAT ARE DEEMED

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.169
IMPORTANT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:02.606
R. DID- OUR STORM WATER WHICH

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:03.206
WOULD BE SORT OF INTERTWINED

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:05.041
WITH CLEAN WATER. BUT SO I

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:08.878
THINK. I ACTUALLY. THIS IS

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.046
SOMETHING THAT I STARTED A

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:11.648
CONVERSATION MR BRICKELL LAST

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:18.021
FALL ABOUT. AN IDEA THAT I

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.255
THINK IT'S ONE THAT AS AN

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.590
INSTITUTION WE COULD PUT OUR

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:23.126
ARMS AROUND. I VIEW IT IS VERY

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:25.862
MALLEABLE BUT I'D LIKE TO. I

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.664
FACTOR REFLECT ON CHANGES

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.899
BEFORE I MAKE THAT HAVE LONG

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:34.070
WAY TO GO I ALSO YOU KNOW. I'LL

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:36.573
SAY THIS FOR A NEW OF THE

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.541
AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT A BILLION

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.677
DOLLARS IT'S NOT A BIG NUMBER

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.579
IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.347
IS FOR LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW.

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:45.982
OTHER THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.852
THAT ARE AVAILABLE- I

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:50.587
PERSONALLY WOULD STRONGLY

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.222
SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE.

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:56.026
FINDING WAYS TO TARGET SUPPORT.

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.727
TO THOSE CALIFORNIA RURAL

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.563
COUNTIES. SO THAT THEY AT

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.399
LEAST. THEY CAN FEEL GRUMPY

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.034
FROM TIME TO TIME WHAT WE DO

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.236
HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL BUT

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:07.037
THERE ARE A PART OF OUR OUR

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:10.240
STATE. AND I REALLY FEEL THIS

00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:12.175

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:15.679

SUCH A ENORMOUS BUT SOMETIME

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:14.637

OR THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES.

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.579
TEND TO GET DOMINATED BY THE

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:25.248
URBAN MEMBERSHIP. RIGHT WE HAVE

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.923
LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND

OFTENTIMES ARE REPRESENTED. AND

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.628
SO JUST CONCERNS ME THAT PEOPLE

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:41.831
BRING. ATTITUDES AND IDEOLOGIES

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:42.499
IN THE ROLE CALIFORNIA THE

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.934
APPROPRIATE- PERFECT EXAMPLE

WE'VE INCREASED OUR WATER.

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:49.472
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE BY 1% IN

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.107
THE LAST FORTY YEARS IN

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.342
CALIFORNIA THAT'S A FACT

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:53.943
MEMBERS SO WE'VE DOUBLED OUR

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.712
POPULATION. AND WE'VE INCREASED

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.448
OUR CAPACITY TO STORE WATER BY

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:01.618
1% AND WE ALL SIT AROUND OH MY

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.086
GOD THERE'S A DROUGHT HOW DO WE

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:04.420

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:08.525
SOME INSTRUCTIONS ON. I SO I

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:10.960
THESE FOLKS STEERING THE

SPENDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHT

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:16.966
COUNTIES I GUESS THAT FALL

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:17.600
UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:20.336
THAT RIGHT- THEY START

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:21.905
ENFORCING COMMUNITY IT'S

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.039
ARGUABLY QUESTIONABLE HOW WE

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.174
COULD HAVE A RURAL

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:24.974
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT WITHOUT A

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.576
DAMMIT. RIGHT GIVEN OUR WATER

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:28.178
PROBLEMS BUT I KNOW THE REASON

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.445
THERE'S NOT A IN THIS

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:30.880
PARTICULAR BILLS BECAUSE IT'S

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:31.981
CONTROVERSIAL WITH URBAN

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:33.316
POLITICS RIGHT NOT

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.684
CONTROVERSIAL WITH THOSE OF US

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:35.885
THAT REPRESENT RURAL CALIFORNIA

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:39.122
FACTORS ARE. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE-

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:41.591
CONSENSUS A REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.393

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:44.561
TO MOVE FOR WITH THESE PROJECTS

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.196
BUT THESE OUTSIDE INTERESTS ALL

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.297
WE DON'T WANT TO INVEST IN THAT

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:49.032
IT'S HUNDRED CENTER SO THOSE

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:50.500
ARE NOT JUST TO REALLY DRILL

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:51.634
DOWN THAT CONCERNED THAT GIVES

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:52.669

INDIVIDUALS AND IN STATEWIDE

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.306
LEADERSHIP AREN'T NECESSARILY.

00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:58.007
SUPPORTIVE OF OUR NEEDS AND

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:58.641

00:57:58.708 --> 00:57:59.976
BETTER WAY TO DO THAT I'M

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:01.644

ANY AMENDMENTS- BUT CERTAIN

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:05.949
WOULD APPRECIATE REAL

00:58:06.015 --> 00:58:08.151
CONSIDERATION ON. HOW WE DON'T

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:11.554

CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOM

COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION R.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.822
C. C. T. A. IS IN STRONG

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.791
OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE- WE

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.626
FIND THIS- MEASURE TO BE A

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.695
REDUNDANT AND A HUGE A

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.664
SUBMISSION A REQUIREMENT FOR A

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.566
LITTLE PUBLIC BENEFIT I THINK

01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:05.067
THE ANALYSIS DID A GREAT JOB IN

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:06.802
LISTING ALL THE REPORTS THAT

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.170
TODAY WE WERE REQUIRED TO

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.738
PROVIDE WE HAVE TO FEDERAL

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:12.908
REPORTS THE- THE JURORS IN THE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.143
NORSE REPORT NETWORK OUTAGE

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.210
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.713
IT'S BECOME BY THE- BY THE FCC

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.681
WE ALSO HAVE THE DERS

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.349
REQUIREMENT THE DISASTER

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.317
INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.218
REPORTS. THESE REPORTS ABOUT

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:24.987
AVERAGES AND THE RESTORATION

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.890
EFFORTS SO IN ADDITION TO THAT-

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.960
THERE WAS LEGISLATION PASSED IN

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.194
TWENTY NINETEEN THIS IS SB SIX

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.162
SEVENTY WHICH ALSO REQUIRES NOT

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:35.297
ONLY NETWORK OUTAGE REPORTING

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.366
REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO REQUIRES

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.068
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FACILITIES

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:40.302
HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.737
RESTORE THOSE FACILITIES AND

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:42.671
WHEN WERE THOSE FACILITIES

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.039
RESTORED. WHAT'S REALLY

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.108
IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS REPORT THE

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:47.042
REPORT BY THAT MCGUIRE

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.911
LEGISLATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:49.645
AND THE FEDERAL REPORTS IS THAT

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.647
THEY ARE CONFIDENTIAL SO I

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:52.548
THINK WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.016
ANALYSIS IS ANY DISCUSSION

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.684
ABOUT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.586
SO THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS

01:10:57.653 --> 01:11:00.022
THIS INDUSTRY SECTOR IS ONE OF

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.590
THE SIXTEEN SECTORSTHAT IS

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.859
CONSIDERED TO BE PROTECTED AND

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.094
THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.496
THAT IN THIS SIR NGUYEN SB SIX

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.831
SEVENTY PASS. LEGISLATION

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.499
IMPLEMENTING THERE IS A

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:12.001
SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THAT

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.569
MEASURE THAT SAYS THIS

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.304
INFORMATION MAY NOT BE SHARED

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:16.639
OTHER THAN WITH LOCAL PUBLIC

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.941
SAFETY OFFICIALS AND WITH THE

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:19.842
NINE ONE ONE CALL CENTERS

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.810
BEYOND THAT IT CANNOT BE SHARED

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.178
SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.580
IN HERE THAT THE PC CAN COME UP

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:25.514
WITH SOME REGULATIONS AND

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.783
RULES. AND ALTHOUGH WE WOULD

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.118
OPPOSE THIS MEASURE MOVING

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.152
FORWARD SHOULD THE MEASURE MOVE

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:32.087
FORWARD YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.155
MEAN AND MEAN WHAT YOU SAY IF

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.923
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL JUST SAY IT'S

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.891
CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S WHAT WE DID

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:41.130
IN SB SIX SEVENTY AND. THAT'S

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:41.730
WHAT YOU CAN DO HERE WITH THIS

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:42.331
ONE TODAY. SO IT'S- WHAT ARE

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.098
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAS

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.366
ABOUT THIS REAL TIME REPORTING

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:46.235
REQUIREMENTS ALTHOUGH WE MAY

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:47.670
NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT A REAL TIME

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.304
REPORT TO SOMEONE SIT IN A DESK

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.273
IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STILL HAVE

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.441
TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.509
YOU COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AS

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.377
THE DISASTERS GOING ON SO THIS

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:56.512
REAL TIME DISCUSSION IS NOT

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:59.782
REALLY- IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.517
HAS ANY MERIT THAT IF YOU WERE

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:03.118
TO DELAY IT. YOU STILL NEED TO

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.020
DO IT SHOULD WE NOT SUBMIT THAT

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:05.587
INFORMATION SHOULD WE MISS

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.589
SOMETHING LATER ON IN A WE

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:10.693
COULD BE PENALIZED FOR THAT SO.

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.361
FAR OUR POSITION IS THAT. I

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.263
THINK. AFTER YOU LIST ALL THE

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:16.098
REPORTS ARE REQUIRED IN

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:16.665
ANALYSIS THE ONE BIG MISSING

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.934
PIECE WAS. WHAT IS BEING

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.136
PROVIDED. IN THIS BILL. THAT IS

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.638
NOT BEING PROVIDED IN THOSE

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.206
OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.408
AND I THINK ONE OF THE- ISSUES

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.343
THAT WAS TOUCHED ON BY THE

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.645
PROPONENTS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.346
WHAT TECHNOLOGY DID YOU USE TO

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.415
RESTORE THAT NETWORK NOW WHEN

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:34.583
YOU PROVIDE NINE ONE ONE

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.085
SERVICE. THE PC HAS

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.352
JURISDICTION OVER WHAT IS THE

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:38.721
DEFINITION OF NINE ONE ONE WHAT

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:39.922
IS THE DEFINITION OF BASIC

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:40.889
TELEPHONE SERVICE BASIC

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.725
TELEPHONE SERVICE. IS ABILITY

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:43.759
TO MAKE AND I WON ONE PHONE

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.427
CALL. IT DOES NOT SPECIFY

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.596
TECHNOLOGY IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:48.597
IN THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO GET

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.998
INTO THE BUSINESS OF DECIDING

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.500
WHAT TECHNOLOGIES MORE PART IS

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.669
COPPER BETTER. THAN FIBER IS

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.571
FIBER BETTER THAN FIVE G. IS

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.106
FIVE YOU BETTER THAN SATELLITE.

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.507
THAT'S NOT A POSITION YOU WANT

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:00.843
TO BE SO- I THINK THE ONLY

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.978
THING I SEE IN THIS MEASURE.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.546
WOULD BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.381
TECHNOLOGY AND I DON'T THINK

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.117
YOU WANT TO GO THERE IN A GIVEN

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:09.985

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.824
A ROAD YOU WANT TO GO DOWN. FOR

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:16.458

WAS A HUGE EFFORT AND IT'S

01:13:58.934 --> 01:13:59.768
INTERESTING BEFORE THIS

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.070

RESPONDERS IN RECOGNIZING WHAT

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.028
SOME OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.196
INFRASTRUCTURE WEAKNESSES CAN

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:30.299
BE. AND THIS WAS ONE OF THEM.

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.401
THIS IS ONE OF- WHERE. DAY

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.556
