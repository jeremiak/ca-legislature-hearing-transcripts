YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:55.980
CHAIR AND MEMBERS MITCHELL

COVERED IT UP WITH THE SERVICE

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.283
EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION

00:31:58.349 --> 00:31:59.984
AND WE REPRESENT HOSPITAL

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:01.753
WORKERS INCLUDING SOCIAL WORKERS

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:03.321
WHO DO DISCHARGE PLANNING

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:05.256
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:06.824
REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO HAVE

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:09.160
POLICIES AND PROCESSES IN PLACE

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:10.161
TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.696
AND WHAT WE NOTICED ABOUT

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.631
EXISTING LAW IS THAT IT IS

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.867
WRITTEN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:17.602
INDIVIDUALS HAVE A HOME AND

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:19.637
FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO GO TO ONCE

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.172
THEY ARE DISCHARGED.

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:22.573
AND SO WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.375
GAP IN EXISTING ONE THAT IT DID

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:26.477
NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR WHAT TO

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:27.779
DO WHEN THAT PERSON HAS NEITHER

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.414
OF THOSE THINGS.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.916
THIS LAW SEEKS TO SPELL SET OUT

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:35.453
DOWN THE REASONABLE STANDARD FOR

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.455
WHAT THE FOR WOULD BE WHAT'S THE

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.590
MINIMUM REQUIRED --

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:41.793
WE ATTEMPTED TO OF WORKOUT

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.328
REASONABLE SOLUTIONS WITH THE

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:45.663
HOSPITAL'S TAKING OVER TWENTY

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.198
FIVE AMENDMENTS TO ATTEMPT TO

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:48.866
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS --

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:50.702
AND SO WE THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.437
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.672
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:57.241
IMPLEMENTED WITHIN WHAT MOST

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:59.177
HOSPITALS ARE ALREADY DOING IT I

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:00.812
HAVE TO SAY THAT MANY OF OUR

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:02.480
HOSPITALS GO FAR ABOVE THE

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:03.848
REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:07.418
BUT WE WANTED TO SET A HUMANE --

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:08.052
FOR FOR TO CATCH SOME OF THOSE

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.188
OUT LIARS OF THOSE SITUATIONS

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.589
WHERE WE WERE SEEING PATIENTS

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.057
ROUTINELY DESTRUCTION HOSPITAL

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.159
GOWNS OR TWO LOCATIONS THAT WERE

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:16.227
UNKNOWN TO THE HOMELESS

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:17.028
INDIVIDUALS.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:18.329
AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:20.264
VERY TIMELY IN THAT IN THIS AREA

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.066
WHERE WE HAVE HOMELESSNESS

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.835
CRISIS AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.203

GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.935
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE

00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:59.237
A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS

00:33:59.303 --> 00:34:00.138

FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK

SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:06.577
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:07.712
HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:09.080
AMENDMENTS WHICH DEFINITELY HAVE

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.248
HELPED.

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:11.983
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO REMAIN

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:15.086
OPPOSED FOR TWO PRIMARY REASONS

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:16.721
THE FIRST REASON IS BECAUSE OF

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:18.890
THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE THAT IS

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.024
IN THE BILL.

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.993
THIS WOULD ALLOW A LOCAL CITY OR

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.495
COUNTY TO PUT IN PLACE LAWS THAT

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.632
ARE STRICTER THAN WATER IN S. B.

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:28.599
ELEVEN FIFTY TWO WE SIMPLY

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.401
DISAGREE WITH THIS WEEK WE DON'T

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.603
THINK THIS BILL SHOULD BE THERE

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.471
FLOOR WE THINK IT SHOULD BE THE

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:36.007
CEILING AT LEAST FOR NOW.

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.809
SECONDLY THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.844
BILL AROUND THE COORDINATION OF

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.746
REFERRALS WHICH WILL BE

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:44.115
DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLY WITH

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:46.584
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS BECAUSE

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:48.519
THERE ARE NOT RESOURCES IN EVERY

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.988
SINGLE COMMUNITY TO WHICH WE CAN.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:53.591
SEND TO THESE PEOPLE.

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.660
TO ON A WEAK CARE FOR THESE

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.795
PEOPLE BUT WHEN WE ARE.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:59.964
DONE GIVING THEM MEDICAL CARE

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:02.333
SOMETIMES THERE ARE NOT SOCIAL

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.968
SERVICES AND BAILABLE IN A GIVEN

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.570
COMMUNITY.

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.672
SO THAT IS THE DILEMMA WE OFTEN

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.540
FIND OURSELVES IN.

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.108
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:12.777
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.879

SO WE REPRESENT WORKERS AT LA

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:41.972
SEE USC WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.574
LARGEST PROVIDER IN LA COUNTY

CORRECT THE LA CITY ATTORNEY HAS

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.612
A LOCAL ORDINANCE --

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.481
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PATTERN OF

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.449
IMPROPER PATIENT DISCHARGES IN

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.251
GENERAL IN THE COUNTY AND THAT

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:55.986
RESTRICTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:58.289

00:40:58.355 --> 00:40:59.290
FURTHER --

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.158
ABOVE THEIR REQUIREMENTS OF THIS

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:03.227

ALREADY EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:10.234
OF THIS BILL SO THEY'RE SORT OF

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.802
CONTAINED UNDER AT A STANDARD

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.604
ABOVE -- WE

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.273
TOOK THE PRE --

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.975
AMENDMENT IN THE BILL --

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.944
BECAUSE LA CITY ATTORNEY FEAR

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.745
ASKED US --

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.814
TO HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.549
THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH --

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:29.053
THIS ONGOING SITUATION IN LA AND

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.855
IT DOES SORT OF GET TO SOME OF

00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:32.690
THAN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:34.191
FACILITIES LA SEE USC FOR

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:36.060
EXAMPLE ALREADY HAS AN ENTIRE

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.261
WAITING ROOM DEDICATED TO

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.896
DEALING WITH PATIENT DISCHARGES

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:41.131

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:42.666
THEY ARE SUPER WELL EQUIPPED TO

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:43.801
DEAL WITH THIS POPULATION THEY

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.203
DO IT EVERY DAY OUR MEMBERS HAVE

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.872
FLOODING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL --

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.673
AND THEY SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.976
BRINGING EVERYBODY UP TO A

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.210
SIMILAR STANDARD BECAUSE THE

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:56.146
SAFETY NET AS I SAID IS ALREADY

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:56.780
DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK REALLY

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.215
WELL [inaudible]

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:01.485
MADAM CHAIR.

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.153
IF IF I COULD ADD NOW.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.088
I'M SORRY.

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:05.055
IF THERE'S THAT AN ADDITIONAL

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.191
QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE IT.

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:07.791
THAT WAS DIRECTED DOT COM THE

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.927
PROPONENTS.

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:12.096
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.832
IF NOT I'D SAY THIS --

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.567
JUST ENJOY A DAY PASS I THINK AT

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.035
THAT FIGHT GIVEN THE FINANCIALS

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:19.103
IT WAS A KIND OF BIZARRE

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.938
SITUATION BECAUSE WE LOOK AT YOU

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.573
SEE COSTS AN ARM.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.909
IN THE SITUATION IT'S NOT AI

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.277
PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND --

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.212
SO IT IS.

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:31.916
FISCALLY A BILL THAT --

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.183
WE SUPPORT.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.919
AND WILL PUT OUT BUT I'M I THINK

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.854
THERE HAVE BEEN STATED CONCERNS

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.988
NOT ONLY FOR MEMBERS ON THIS

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.291
COMITTEE BUT A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:41.692
MEMBERS THAT I WOULD SUGGEST I'M

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.493
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.827
CONFUSION AROUND THE PREEMPTION

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:44.695
LANGUAGE.

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.530
AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE IT IS LA

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:48.098
CITY THAT CAUSED THE PREEMPTION

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.900
LANGUAGE WHICH IS NOW CAUSING

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.969
OTHER PEOPLE ANXIETY --

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.337
AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.205
THAT THEY I KNOW THERE'S NO

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.840
DESIRE TAKEN AMENDMENT ON THAT I

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.242
UNDERSTAND WHY AND I THINK IT'S

00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:59.243
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING CONTINUE

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.245
TO BE AN ISSUE FOR YOU --

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:03.747
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:04.682
AND I THINK PROBABLY OTHER

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.250
PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY IN SAN

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.851
DIEGO WE'VE HAD A HUGE PROBLEM

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.353
WITH UCSD IN PARTICULAR.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.654
DISCHARGING PEOPLE WHEN I FIRST

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:11.956
READ THE BILL I SAID THANK GOD

HALF EXPOSED IN A HOSPITAL GOWN

AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD FOR

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.466
THEM IT'S NOT THAT FAR COMMUNITY

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.868
AND I'M I I THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.170
NECESSARY STEPS THAT NEED TO BE

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:27.705
TAKEN THAT ARE BEING TAKEN A LOT

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.573
OF TIMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

I JUST ADDED I JUST HOPE

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:32.843
[inaudible]

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.279
I'M SHOULD MOVE FOR TODAY ON THE

IT DEALT WITH PENALTIES IF THE

I AM.

THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR ME

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:02.879
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:03.780
ABOUT THIS BILL DOES HAVE A DO

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.048

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.683
THINK THIS BILL WILL SAVE THE

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.551
STATE MONEY.

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.219
I'M I THINK THE BASICS OF THIS

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:11.121
BILL ARE PHENOMENAL IT'S

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.522
SOMETHING I AGREE WITH THAT WE

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.256
HAD.

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.624
I HAD ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS AND

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.293

YOU PASS ASSEMBLY WANTED MY

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.129
AMENDMENTS BUT I'LL CLARIFY THAT

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:20.497
THE REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:21.531
BILL TODAY.

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:22.465
AND WILL NOT BE SPRINT FOR

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:26.836
WITHOUT CHANGING. TO ALLOW

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:29.039
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:31.041
ENHANCEMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:32.242
SEX CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN --

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.843
FORCIBLE RAPE [inaudible]

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:37.247
AND CHILD MOLESTATION AND THE

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:39.015
REASON FOR THAT QUITE FRANKLY WE

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.884
HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION.

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:41.851
IS -- AFTER

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:44.187
SCENE AFTER WITNESSING IN FACT

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:45.789
ALL OF OUR DISMAY ABOUT JUDICIAL

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.057
DISCRETION IN THE PROP TURNER

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.425
CASE.

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:49.459
AND HOW MEAN --

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:52.429
SEEN A A LOT OF TIMES WHEN AND

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:54.230
JUDICIAL DISCRETION MEANS THAT

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:56.399
THE JUDGE THEMSELVES ARE BIASED.

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.100
AND THE RESULT OF THAT

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.435
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.270
ABOUT REPEAT OFFENSES THAT THERE

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:02.973
ARE SO AND CRITICAL TO OUR

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.274
COMMUNITY SAFETY.

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.275
AND SO WHAT IT COMES TO

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.876
CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN IT

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.878
COMES A FORCIBLE RAPE I JUST.

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.280
IN NOT AT A POINT WITH OUR

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:12.616
JUDICIARY YET BECAUSE WE WE AND

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:13.984
WE TALK ABOUT THIS HOPEFULLY WE

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.418
WILL GET THERE WHERE WE HAVE AN

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.721
UNBIASED IN MORE REPRESENTATIVE --

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.422
JUDICIARY THAT DOESN'T JUST SEE

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.891
DEFENDANTS AS THEMSELVES --

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:25.128
IN AND PERHAPS HAVE AND IN SOME

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:28.264
CASES AND MORE LENIENT SENTENCE

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.766
SEEN -- ON

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.834
CRIMES THAT ARE* THAT WE

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.168
WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:34.204
BECAUSE THERE'S A CONNECTION

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.606
THERE --

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.375
BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS I'M

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:39.743
I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE DISPLAY

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:40.777
WITHOUT THOSE --

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:42.479
EXEMPTIONS AND SO I CAN'T

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:43.346
SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT WE

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:45.749
ARE STILL AND I'M GOING TO GET

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:46.216
THIS OUT ON A DAY PASS

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:47.417
RECOMMENDATION.

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.586
WAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE THE

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.330
FACT THAT RELY ON IT TO MOVE

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:01.798
TODAY SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:02.966
SCHOOL IMPACT AND REALLY KIND

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.467
THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS A

00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:05.702
POLICY ISSUE.

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.370
AND I'LL HOPEFULLY WE GET OUT OF

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:08.271
COMMITTEE TODAY WILL HAVE THE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.439
OPPORTUNITY HAVE THAT FULLER

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:10.607
DEBATE ON THE FLOOR.

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.075
ON IN MY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:15.412
WITH MADAME SHE THE LAUNDRY LIST

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:16.546
OF THE EXISTING SINCE

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.081
ENHANCEMENTS THAT THIS BILL DOES

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.683
NOT TOUCH THAT WOULD CONTINUE

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.418
THE IMPACT THE POPULATION AND

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.819
THE CHARGES THAT MADAM CHAIR

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:23.586
TALKED ABOUT.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.621
AND FUNDAMENTALLY FROM MY

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.623
PERSPECTIVE THE REASON I WAS NOT

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.191
OPEN TO TAKING AMENDMENTS IS I

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:31.394
AM ALSO CLEAR THAT IT WAS A A A

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:33.663
LEGISLATURE THAT --

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:34.931
LACK TO THE DIVERSITY WE

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.499
EXPERIENCED TODAY THIRTY FIVE

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:38.301
AND FORTY YEARS THAT PASSED

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.836
BILLS THAT CREATED THE SITUATION

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:42.972
WHICH WE NOW LIVE WITH OVER FOUR

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:43.573
HUNDRED SINCE ENHANCEMENTS ON

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.307

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:46.142
I COMPLETELY SUPPORT AND AGREE

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:47.343
THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:48.978
JUDICIARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:50.880
ON OUR TRIP THAT JUSTICE IS

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:51.948
TRULY BOTTOM.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.049
BUT I AM NOT COMFORTABLE

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.318
CONTINUING --

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.786
IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH A

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:58.354
LEGISLATURE --

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.690
THAT LACK OF DIVERSITY THIRTY

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.158
FIVE TO FORTY YEARS AGO WHO TOOK

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:05.895

BEING TOUGH ON CRIME.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.399
AND TOUGH ON DRUGS POLICIES THAT

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.534
WE KNOW NOW THANKS TO RESEARCH

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:13.937
AND ARE YOU KNOW HINDSIGHT IS

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:15.805
TWENTY TWENTY FAILED MISERABLY

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.307

00:56:17.907 --> 00:56:19.242
COMMUNITY.

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.376
AND SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:21.978
CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.179
IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT CERTAIN SAN

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.948
ENHANCEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD WE

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.683
EMPOWER THE JUDICIARY TO DO THE

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.685
JOB THAT WE PAY THEM.

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.487
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DO.

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:31.488
AND I LOOK TO PARTNER WITH YOU

00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:32.355

CALIFORNIA'S JUDICIARY

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:35.558
[inaudible]

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:37.861
DOES REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.629
ONES THAT THE DIVERSITY OF

CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND THAT

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.533
JUSTICE IS INDEED BLIND UNTIL

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.034
THEN I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

DIFFICULTIES HER FATHER'S.

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:56.216
THAT SHE HAD MADE.
