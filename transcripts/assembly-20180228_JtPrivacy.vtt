ISSUES AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:47.086 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY

00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:49.588 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT. OF THE LAST FEW

00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:51.357 region:rollup2
YEARS I'D IS MY HOPE THAT OUR

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:53.759 region:rollup2

00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:55.394 region:rollup2

KEEP OUR STATE MOVING IN THE

00:24:55.394 --> 00:24:59.098 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT I MEAN BY

00:24:57.096 --> 00:25:01.300 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH?

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:02.601 region:rollup2
IS THAT DOW ONE THAT INVOLVES

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.103 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS. FROM THE

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:05.471 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO THE

00:25:04.103 --> 00:25:07.106 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE FROM THE STATE

00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:10.075 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TO THE FEDERAL AND TO

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:10.442 region:rollup2
THE LOCALS AND FROM THE PUBLIC

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:12.144 region:rollup2
TO THE PRIVATE.

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:14.747 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:16.348 region:rollup2
A SILO WOULD OPPOSE CHAU. TO IT

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:18.117 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE SUCH AS

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:19.518 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY IS NOT THE MOST

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:21.453 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT APPROACH.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:23.422 region:rollup2
OUR AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT A

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:24.857 region:rollup2
REACTIONARY APPROACH IS NOT A

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:26.291 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE OPTION IN TODAY'S

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:28.060 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:30.863 region:rollup2
WORD NEW CYBER ATTACKS ARE

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:32.464 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:34.900 region:rollup2
BEST SECURITY.

AND WHAT.

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:39.772 region:rollup2
SO OVER BOTH SOLUTIONS TO

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.740 region:rollup2
INSULATE OURSELVES IN THE MODERN

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:43.475 region:rollup2
WORLD. THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.711 region:rollup2
CAN INCREASE OUR DETECTION

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:46.245 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES. IMPROVE OUR

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:49.014 region:rollup2

IN MANY RESPECTS SOME VERY

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:54.019 region:rollup2

WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NO

00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:22.840 region:rollup2
SUCH THING AS THE PERFECT SIDERS

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:24.775 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY BUT.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.010 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUALLY

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:27.144 region:rollup2
BE ATTENTION BETWEEN THE

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.546 region:rollup2
AGGRESSORS AS NEW

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:29.814 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES ARE IDENTIFIED

00:47:28.546 --> 00:47:31.782 region:rollup2
AS COMPUTING POWER NETWORK

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:32.049 region:rollup2
BANDWIDTH INCREASE.

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:33.384 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:34.051 region:rollup2
THE DEFENDERS.

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:35.486 region:rollup2
AS.

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:37.455 region:rollup2
THOSE VULNERABILITIES ARE

00:47:35.486 --> 00:47:38.422 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AND FIXED AND AS NEW

00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:39.990 region:rollup2
TACTICS AND.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:41.225 region:rollup2
AND NEW BAD ACTORS ARE

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.927 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SO.

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:44.128 region:rollup2
THE BALANCE OF POWER'S GOING TO

00:47:42.927 --> 00:47:45.262 region:rollup2
SHIFT BACK AND FORTH I'M CURIOUS

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:47.465 region:rollup2
AS TO YOUR OPINION.

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:49.133 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE ARE.

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:50.801 region:rollup2
WE'RE WINNING THE BATTLE OF

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:52.203 region:rollup2
WERE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HER

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.671 region:rollup2
WERE ABOUT THE SAME PLACE WHERE

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.205 region:rollup2
WE WERE TWO YEARS AGO WITH

00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:55.973 region:rollup2
ERRORS IN RESPECT OF THOSE

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:57.975 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:59.610 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD DIE I I PROBABLY

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:01.078 region:rollup2
WON'T PUT DEED OPINION ON

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.580 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE ARE. WINNING OR

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:05.383 region:rollup2
LOSING ABOUT OR OR EVEN BUT I

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.851 region:rollup2
CAN CITE DOT SPECIFICALLY.

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:08.185 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU HAVE CITED THE THAT

00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:09.887 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO PRONGED APPROACH

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
WERE OR WERE IMPLEMENTING AND

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:13.357 region:rollup2
AND AND IS HAVE SEEN GREAT

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:14.158 region:rollup2
RESULTS FROM IT. NUMBER ONE AS I

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:16.026 region:rollup2
MENTIONED DIED.

00:48:14.158 --> 00:48:17.394 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES TOSSED

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:18.629 region:rollup2
TO SAID THE TECHNOLOGY AND

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:20.965 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARD FOR THE

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:22.833 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THAT AND

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:23.768 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RECENTLY.

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.836 region:rollup2
STOOD UP A.

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
A HYBRID CLOUD SERVICE WHICH

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:28.506 region:rollup2
AGAIN THAT WOULD BE ELABORATE

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.040 region:rollup2
FURTHER OUGHT TO DEFINE A VERY

00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:32.243 region:rollup2
HIGH STANDARD OF A SECURITY

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.779 region:rollup2
MEASURE AND AND AND AND AND.

00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
AND I'LL PUT THAT INTO A POLICY

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:37.882 region:rollup2
AS A WAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.116 region:rollup2
STAND STATE ENTITY THAT YOUR

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:39.850 region:rollup2
WHOLE LIFE SEEING THEIR

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:41.585 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.020 region:rollup2
CONNECTION TO MEET THAT

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:46.157 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR STANDARD. AND THAT'S

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:48.559 region:rollup2
A PROACTIVE WAY TOO IF YOU WOULD

00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:50.394 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARD YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:52.963 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HIGHWAY THAT WHICH

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:55.299 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ON AS A WAY OF.

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:57.935 region:rollup2
PUTTING ADDITIONAL.

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:59.970 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGES FOR ANY OF THE

00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:01.439 region:rollup2
ATTACKERS WANTS TO COME IN THAT

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.507 region:rollup2
IS NUMBER ONE FROM A POLICY AND

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:04.875 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE PROSPECTIVE. NUMBER

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:08.279 region:rollup2
TWO.

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:09.513 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BUT A STOOD UP THE

00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:11.916 region:rollup2
FIRST EVER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:17.788 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE DATA CENTER.

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:20.691 region:rollup2
DOT IS A WORKING IN CONJUNCTION

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:24.295 region:rollup2
WITH CAL SIGNAL THE PARTNER HERE

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:27.164 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDES TO THE E. OF VANCE

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:30.167 region:rollup2
MONITORING TO A VERY SPECIFIC

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:33.103 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO PRO ACTIVELY WATCHING

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
TRANSITION OF A CONNECTIVITY.

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:42.813 region:rollup2
AND INFORMATION SHARING AND WITH

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:44.248 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF A MONITORING AND A

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:48.385 region:rollup2
HIGH STANDARD FROM THE NETWORK

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:49.486 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:52.323 region:rollup2
TWO.

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:52.957 region:rollup2
FAIRLY.

00:49:52.323 --> 00:50:01.732 region:rollup2
FOR ACTIVE MEASURES INFORMATION

00:49:52.957 --> 00:50:02.833 region:rollup2
SECURITY MOONLIGHT

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:06.136 region:rollup2
DOLLAR HIS THINK YOU'VE SEEN OFF

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:06.370 region:rollup2
TIME IS KEEPING UP WHAT IS GOING

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:06.670 region:rollup2
ON WITH.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.538 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.473 region:rollup2
.

00:50:07.538 --> 00:50:11.709 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MEASURES IN PLACE HELPS

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:13.444 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE A

00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:14.712 region:rollup2
STEP AHEAD IF NOT SWITCHED UP AT

00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:15.579 region:rollup2
LEAST HALF A STEP AHEAD.

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:17.715 region:rollup2
SETTING THE STANDARD SETTING THE

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:19.850 region:rollup2
POLICY IMPLEMENTING THOSE POLICY

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.251 region:rollup2
AND THEN PRACTICALLY MONITORING.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.352 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S FOR OUR.

00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:23.754 region:rollup2
.

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:25.523 region:rollup2
APPROACH IN ADDRESSING.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.956 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ARE BUT YOU'RE DOING

00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:28.859 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK.

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:30.394 region:rollup2
I WONDER THOUGH IF WE SHOULDN'T

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:31.729 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING AT SOME METRICS TO

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:33.564 region:rollup2
TRY AND IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT

00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:34.565 region:rollup2
WE'RE WINNING OR LOSING BECAUSE

00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:36.233 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:37.368 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION YOU SUCKED GOALS.

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:39.436 region:rollup2
YOU SET PROCEDURES FROM MEETING

00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:40.638 region:rollup2
THOSE GOALS I THINK WE ALSO NEED

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:42.172 region:rollup2
TO BE RETROSPECTIVE AND.

00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:44.041 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:45.676 region:rollup2
AND SEE IF WE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:47.678 region:rollup2
DOING AFFECTED PRESENT NOT

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:48.746 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE OR YOU KNOW AND AND

00:50:47.678 --> 00:50:50.414 region:rollup2
LET US GUIDE LETTERS USE THOSE

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:51.181 region:rollup2
METRICS TO GUIDE FUTURE

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:53.083 region:rollup2
DECISIONS SO.

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:54.018 region:rollup2
THE I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:56.553 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

00:50:54.018 --> 00:50:57.888 region:rollup2
OUT OF NOT NUMBER OF BREACHES OR

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:59.356 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT'S BEEN

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:01.091 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED OR SOMETHING OR SOME

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.059 region:rollup2
SORT OF METRIC. THE TRIES TO

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:03.994 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE

00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:05.462 region:rollup2
WINNING A REAL LOSING OR GAINING

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:09.900 region:rollup2
GROUND I THINK THERE WILL BE

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:10.467 region:rollup2
FRUITFUL IN IDENTIFYING OTHER

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.936 region:rollup2
PATHS THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:13.370 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:14.672 region:rollup2
THANK YOUR FOR THAT SEGUE DOT

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.872 region:rollup2
HEIGHT I DID NEGLECT TO MENTION

00:51:14.672 --> 00:51:15.606 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:16.507 region:rollup2
.

00:51:15.606 --> 00:51:16.707 region:rollup2
THINK WAS LITERALLY TWO WEEKS

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:17.808 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:18.876 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ON BEHALF

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.510 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE ISSUED OUR TWO

00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:21.178 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN ANNUAL REPORT.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.613 region:rollup2
AND THE ANNUAL REPORT ITSELF.

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:23.614 region:rollup2
I WISH I BROUGHT A COPY WITH ME

00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:24.448 region:rollup2
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT A COPIES

00:51:23.614 --> 00:51:25.683 region:rollup2
DELIVERED TO ALL THE MEMBERS

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.151 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. THAT HAVE LOW HUGE

00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:28.586 region:rollup2
PAGE NOT HUGE GREAT TWO PAGES

00:51:27.151 --> 00:51:29.553 region:rollup2
FOR OF.

00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:30.688 region:rollup2
METRICS

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:32.356 region:rollup2
THE ARE RANGING NOT JUST A

00:51:30.688 --> 00:51:33.857 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY RELATED MATRIX

00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:35.092 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BUILDING UPON TWO

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:36.794 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIXTEEN'S PERFORMED

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:38.429 region:rollup2
METRICS BUT ALSO.

00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:39.630 region:rollup2
HAVE METRICS ON THE WORKFORCE

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:40.631 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS THE

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.899 region:rollup2
PROJECT MANAGEMENT SIDE OF

00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:43.434 region:rollup2
THINGS AND THE TECHNOLOGY

00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:44.902 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE UTILIZATION THIS

00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:46.837 region:rollup2
CENTER SECTION STANDARDIZATION

00:51:44.902 --> 00:51:47.571 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THINGS SO YES WE ARE

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:49.473 region:rollup2
HEAVILY.

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:51.642 region:rollup2
USING THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:53.744 region:rollup2
TO GUIDE HERSELF AND ASHURA

00:51:51.642 --> 00:51:55.112 region:rollup2
PROGRESS BUT WERE ALSO CONTINUE

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:56.747 region:rollup2
TO EVOLVE THOSE METRICS TO

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:58.582 region:rollup2
BETTER CAPTURED YOU KNOW WHAT

00:51:56.747 --> 00:52:00.818 region:rollup2
TRUE MEASUREMENT CAN BE PUT IN

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
PLACE TO BETTER ABOUT.

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MEASURE PROGRESS

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.122 region:rollup2
SO BASED ON THOSE METRICS WOULD

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.357 region:rollup2
YOU SAY WERE MAKING PROGRESS.

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.992 region:rollup2
BASED ON THIS METRIC COMPARED TO

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:08.626 region:rollup2
DAWSON SEVEN TWO TWO THOUSAND

00:52:07.992 --> 00:52:09.326 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WOULD DEFINITELY MAKING

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:12.696 region:rollup2
PROGRESS

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:14.231 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:16.066 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAP ARM I JUST

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:18.002 region:rollup2
OF A BROAD QUESTION AND A WHEN

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:18.602 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO PREPAREDNESS TO AS A

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:20.404 region:rollup2
STATE AGAINST A CYBER ATTACKS

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:22.473 region:rollup2
ON.

00:52:20.404 --> 00:52:28.245 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE STACK UP AGAINST

00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:30.214 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY ON?

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:31.081 region:rollup2
ANYONE WHO GOING THEY ARE FAKE

00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:32.716 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I.

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:34.885 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:36.420 region:rollup2
ALL ALL THE STATE'S OBVIOUSLY

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:39.723 region:rollup2
HAVE A CYBER THREAT.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.491 region:rollup2
SO SOME MORE THAN OTHERS AND IT

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:41.525 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON THE.

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:43.627 region:rollup2
IT DEPENDS ON THE.

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:44.094 region:rollup2
CYBER ACTOR AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:46.296 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR OBVIOUSLY

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:47.431 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:50.100 region:rollup2

00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:52.503 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.203 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE ARE. A HUGE TARGET

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.305 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:56.607 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE ESPIONAGE IN BEING

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:58.108 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET.

00:52:56.607 --> 00:52:59.576 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:02.613 region:rollup2
AT BUSINESS ADVANTAGE.

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:02.813 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STATES OF

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:05.816 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:53:02.813 --> 00:53:08.152 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY PURSUING SOME SORT OF

00:53:05.816 --> 00:53:09.086 region:rollup2
CYBER DEFENSE CAPABILITY.

00:53:08.152 --> 00:53:11.722 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:13.857 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY ONLY A HANDFUL

00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:15.225 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO A

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:17.094 region:rollup2
PLACE WHERE WE ARE OUT IN

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.761 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND DOUBT WE WERE

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:18.529 region:rollup2
CLOSELY.

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:20.864 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:22.533 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS OTHER INTELLIGENCE

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:25.269 region:rollup2
NETWORKS IN THE COUNTRY.

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:26.236 region:rollup2
AND AND THOSE INTELLIGENCE NET

00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:28.305 region:rollup2
THOSE INTELLIGENCE CENTERS ARE

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:29.606 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE WITH THE CYBER

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:31.442 region:rollup2
UNITS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING IN

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:34.278 region:rollup2
PLACE BUT. I THINK YOU KNOW.

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:36.880 region:rollup2
THERE'S PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT

00:53:34.278 --> 00:53:38.215 region:rollup2
STATES NOW THAT HAVE REALLY

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.084 region:rollup2
STARTED TO BUILD.

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:41.018 region:rollup2
CAPACITY LIKE WE HAVE HERE IN

00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:42.086 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:41.018 --> 00:53:42.753 region:rollup2
AND WE IN WEEK AND WE'RE

00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:43.887 region:rollup2
LEARNING FROM THEM AS WELL SOME

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:45.456 region:rollup2
OF THE HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS.

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.824 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:48.358 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING IN THE AND THEY'RE

00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:50.260 region:rollup2
TAKING OBVIOUSLY FOR MONTHS IT

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:52.229 region:rollup2
IS A IT IS THE IT IS REALLY

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.664 region:rollup2
BUILT ON THIS COLLABORATIVE.

00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
SHARING OF INFORMATION PLATFORM

00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
AND AS FAR AS THE FREQUENCY AND

00:53:56.033 --> 00:54:00.003 region:rollup2
SEVERITY OF THE CYBER ATTACKS SO

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:01.805 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:04.007 region:rollup2
BEING SINGLED OUT OR. IS

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:04.208 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE FEW STATES

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:08.045 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:08.812 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACTORS TEND TO TARGET OF

00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:11.048 region:rollup2

ARE MITIGATING A LOT OF THE

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:39.009 region:rollup2
STUFF THAT'S COMING IN THROUGH.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:40.978 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:43.147 region:rollup2
IT BE AS THE AS THE GENERAL

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:45.149 region:rollup2
SAID THIS IS THIS IS A THIS IS A

00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:46.950 region:rollup2
NON YOU KNOW NONSTOP KINDA DEAL

00:54:45.149 --> 00:54:48.585 region:rollup2
AND IT REQUIRES. THAT TWENTY

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE

KNOW.

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:55.259 region:rollup2
THE ONLY OTHER.

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:57.461 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS THAT WHEN WE DO

00:54:55.259 --> 00:55:00.330 region:rollup2
HAVE A GREAT ECONOMY AND WE DO

00:54:57.461 --> 00:55:02.366 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY INNOVATIVE.

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:04.301 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL BASE AND AND THAT

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:05.435 region:rollup2
INNOVATION IS.

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:07.571 region:rollup2
ATTRACTIVE TO.

AND I THINK THAT WITH WITH THE

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:15.145 region:rollup2
CASE OF BOB YOU KNOW SORT OF

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:17.080 region:rollup2
POLITICAL STANCES.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:19.383 region:rollup2
LA TIMES WE WILL WILSON

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.751 region:rollup2
STARTING THE SEA RANSOMWARE AND

00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:23.520 region:rollup2
OTHER KINDS OF A DENIAL OF

00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:24.955 region:rollup2
SERVICE ATTACKS. THAT OCCUR.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.056 region:rollup2
GENERALLY MOST OF THE STATES ARE

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:28.125 region:rollup2
SEEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
WELL DEPENDS ON ON YOU KNOW WHAT

00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:31.762 region:rollup2
THE POLITICAL NURSES OF THE OF

IN THE STATE OR SOME KIND OF A

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.532 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT. A GROUP WANTS TO

MAKE.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.168 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:39.670 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WE LOOK AT

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:41.238 region:rollup2
STEALING YOU KNOW FROM AN

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.473 region:rollup2
ESPIONAGE STANDPOINT OR.

00:55:41.238 --> 00:55:45.375 region:rollup2
OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:46.910 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ARE THOSE THE

MEASURE HOLISTICALLY. VERSUS IN

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.516 region:rollup2
THE PAST WHEN EACH DEPARTMENT

00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:07.617 region:rollup2
ARE HANDLING THINGS ON THEIR OWN

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:09.252 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON

MICROSOFT ITSELF HAVE ALSO

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:21.965 region:rollup2
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE

00:58:19.196 --> 00:58:23.100 region:rollup2
UTILIZED TO HELP SCREEN OUR FLAG

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:24.801 region:rollup2
ABOUT MAYBE A BETTER WORK THAT

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.536 region:rollup2

WELL AS TECHNOLOGY ARE BEING

00:58:28.405 --> 00:58:32.109 region:rollup2
CENTRALLY MANAGE THEN IT'S A

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:34.144 region:rollup2

INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT AND AUDIT

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:24.554 region:rollup2

WE HAVE AN OPERATIONAL

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:41.830 region:rollup2
COMPONENT AND WE HAVE A POLICY

01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:42.864 region:rollup2
IN OVERSIGHT COMPONENT AND I'LL

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:44.766 region:rollup2
START OFF WITH THE OPERATIONAL

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:46.134 region:rollup2
COMPONENT. AS IS MOST GERMANE TO

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:48.336 region:rollup2
THE TOPICS TODAY.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:49.938 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:51.440 region:rollup2
CDT SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:53.408 region:rollup2
THE CT SOCK.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
I JUST I THINK ONE OF THE BIG

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:56.278 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'VE MADE IS

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.813 region:rollup2
THIS TIME THIS LAST YEAR.

01:26:56.278 --> 01:26:59.748 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST A CONCEPT.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:02.184 region:rollup2
A.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:03.351 region:rollup2
WITHIN A YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY AT

01:27:02.184 --> 01:27:04.720 region:rollup2
WITH AND ACTUALLY FIVE MONTHS WE

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.987 region:rollup2
WILL STAND UP OUR FIRST

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.289 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY WITH IT.

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:09.091 region:rollup2
AND TODAY.

01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:11.660 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S NOW TWENTY

01:27:09.091 --> 01:27:12.427 region:rollup2
FOUR BY SEVEN. IT'S CO STAFFED

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.528 region:rollup2
WITH BOTH THE MILITARY

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:17.566 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:18.567 region:rollup2
I AND IT'S EFFECTIVE WERE ON

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:20.402 region:rollup2
AVERAGE.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.436 region:rollup2
IT FLUCTUATES OR BLOCKING

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.471 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.739 region:rollup2
MILLION ATTACKS.

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:26.274 region:rollup2
MALICIOUS PROBES.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:29.010 region:rollup2
PER DAY.

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:30.612 region:rollup2
WE ASK US FAR HAVE REVIEWED.

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:32.147 region:rollup2
APPROX ME HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:33.882 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND.

01:27:32.147 --> 01:27:35.617 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS OFFENSE OR ALERTS.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:37.853 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:40.422 region:rollup2
A. INDICATION OF A TYPE OF.

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:42.124 region:rollup2
ATTACK OR TRAFFIC WHICH MAY BE.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:43.391 region:rollup2
INDICATOR OF IT AN ATTACK.

01:27:42.124 --> 01:27:45.026 region:rollup2
OUR FOLKS WILL ACTUALLY GO IN

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:46.094 region:rollup2
AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:47.796 region:rollup2
IS SO THE INVESTIGATE. SO

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.164 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT WORK EFFORT.

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:52.434 region:rollup2
AND IT'S.

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:53.001 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A PRETTY GOOD A STACK

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.603 region:rollup2
THE SHOW THAT WERE ACTUALLY

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:56.371 region:rollup2
SHOWING PROGRESS.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:59.207 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT EFFECTIVE I WOULD SAY

01:27:56.371 --> 01:28:02.010 region:rollup2
YES SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN JULY.

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:02.244 region:rollup2
WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED. AND

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:04.212 region:rollup2
HELPED.

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:05.747 region:rollup2
ENTITIES REMEDIATE EIGHTEEN

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:07.582 region:rollup2
DISTINCT MALICIOUS.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:09.851 region:rollup2
ACTIONS OR EVENTS.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.852 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:12.788 region:rollup2
SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:16.024 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:17.659 region:rollup2
SOCK INTO IS DESIGNED TO DO. IS

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:18.960 region:rollup2
TO HELP A STATEWIDE.

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:20.095 region:rollup2
DETECTION AND MONITORING

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.530 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY.

01:28:20.095 --> 01:28:22.831 region:rollup2
INTO POWER.

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES.

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:25.801 region:rollup2
TO KNOW MONITORING NETWORKS AND

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.802 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T MISS

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:29.571 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. UNABLE TO REMEDIATE.

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:30.939 region:rollup2
YA MALICIOUS OFFENSE ASSUMES

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:31.740 region:rollup2
THAT CAR.

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:33.008 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THE

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.843 region:rollup2
SOCK IS WERE ACTUALLY STRATEGIC

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:36.444 region:rollup2
PARTNER WITH CAL SICK.

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:37.779 region:rollup2
AND WERE VERY EXCITED WITH THIS

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.881 region:rollup2
WE CAN JUST.

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:41.049 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE PROVIDED FROM CAL

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:42.517 region:rollup2
SICK WHICH IS A THREAT

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:44.085 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE FEED.

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:45.253 region:rollup2
IT'S COMBINED FEED AND STATE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:47.088 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:48.223 region:rollup2
A DIRECTOR VERDUCCI HAD

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.324 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THERE ARE VERY FEW.

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:51.793 region:rollup2
STATES OUT THERE THAT CAN DO

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:53.528 region:rollup2
THIS I WOULD SAY. A VERY FEW IS

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:55.897 region:rollup2
A UNDERSTATEMENT.

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:58.366 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:28:55.897 --> 01:29:00.435 region:rollup2
AT DOT GOV SPECIFIC FEED.

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:02.003 region:rollup2
ALLOWS OUR INTELLIGENCE.

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:04.072 region:rollup2
OR ALLOWS OUR ANALYSTS TO

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:06.208 region:rollup2
UTILIZE CUSTOMIZED INTELLIGENCE

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:08.143 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THEIR JOB A LOT EASIER.

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:09.411 region:rollup2
BY BEING A STRATEGIC PARTNER

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:12.013 region:rollup2
WITH CAL SICK.

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:13.215 region:rollup2
WE IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE A ABOUT

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:14.683 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ENTITIES AT

01:29:13.215 --> 01:29:16.918 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK LEVEL.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.485 region:rollup2
NOW BEING ABLE TO PASS ALERTS

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.687 region:rollup2
AND INFORMATION OVER TO CAL

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:21.256 region:rollup2
SICK.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT. AND

01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:23.258 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY AS A STATE TO

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:27.162 region:rollup2
DETECT.

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:28.730 region:rollup2
MONITOR UMPIRE NETWORK TRAFFIC.

01:29:27.162 --> 01:29:28.930 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:30.899 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:32.367 region:rollup2
.

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:33.535 region:rollup2
IS REALLY DISTRESSING THAT.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:34.970 region:rollup2
UP THERE A COUPLE FACTORS THAT.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.604 region:rollup2
.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:37.339 region:rollup2
I WOULD MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:39.507 region:rollup2
OF ONE. THIS IS A.

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:41.343 region:rollup2
MARATHON NOT A SPRINT SPECIAL

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:43.044 region:rollup2
INCOMES NETWORK DETECTION.

01:29:41.343 --> 01:29:44.446 region:rollup2
AND OUR CAPABILITY THERE.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:46.147 region:rollup2
OUR FOLKS ARE NEW.

01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:47.549 region:rollup2
THEY STOOD UP IN JULY AYE BUT

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.216 region:rollup2
WE'VE INVEST A LOT OF TIME AND

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.851 region:rollup2
EFFORT AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.386 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY CAPABLE THEIR JOBS AS

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
FAR. AND AS SOMETHING THAT.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.455 region:rollup2
WILL BE CONTINUALLY ITERATING

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:55.223 region:rollup2
ON.

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:56.891 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD INCREASING WITH

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:58.393 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY.

01:29:56.891 --> 01:30:00.495 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TRAINING.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:02.297 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND AND AND ADDITIONAL

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.365 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AS WE SEE OTHER NEED

TO DO SO.

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:07.836 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS THERE

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:10.171 region:rollup2
ON ON THAT FRONT FOR SURE.

AGAIN IN THIS AREA AND

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:24.586 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:26.154 region:rollup2
FIRST ON THE POLICY SIDE.

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:28.290 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEVERAGED.

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:30.392 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:32.127 region:rollup2
COMING FROM OF THE LEGISLATURE.

TECHNOLOGY RECOVERY PLANS THIS

01:30:36.131 --> 01:30:39.734 region:rollup2
IS THE PLAN THAT ALL ENTITIES IN

01:30:38.333 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
THE STATE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE.

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:42.637 region:rollup2
.

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:44.005 region:rollup2
DETAILS WHAT THEY DO IF

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:45.907 region:rollup2
SOMETHING GOES WRONG THERE'S A

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:46.508 region:rollup2
DISRUPTION OR AN EVENT THAT IT

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:47.943 region:rollup2
KNOCKS OUT THERE ARE CRITICAL

01:30:46.508 --> 01:30:48.476 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.978 region:rollup2
HOW DO THEY BRING US BACK

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:51.279 region:rollup2
ONLINE?

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.948 region:rollup2
THOSE TO.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.049 region:rollup2
BILLS ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN IT BY.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.183 region:rollup2
IT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:30:54.049 --> 01:30:56.685 region:rollup2
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:58.253 region:rollup2
CRITICAL SYSTEMS NOW.

01:30:56.685 --> 01:30:59.621 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DETAILED INTO THOSE

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:02.090 region:rollup2
REPORTS AND THEY HAVE.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:02.657 region:rollup2
PLANS ON HOW TO REMEDIATE IN

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:03.892 region:rollup2
CASE THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:05.427 region:rollup2
OCCURS WITH THEM.

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:07.028 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT.

01:31:05.427 --> 01:31:08.530 region:rollup2
ALSO AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY THREE

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:09.064 region:rollup2
A DIRECTOR TOM MENTIONED THIS

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.700 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY.

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:12.867 region:rollup2
IT SECURITY SPENDING THIS IS

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.436 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT OUT A POLICY ON THIS

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:16.204 region:rollup2
AS WELL REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:17.706 region:rollup2
STARTED GETTING DATA.

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:20.375 region:rollup2
THIS NEXT YEAR ON THIS.

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:21.843 region:rollup2
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR US TO SEE

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:23.478 region:rollup2
HOW THE SECURITY SPENDING IS.

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:24.846 region:rollup2
GOING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:27.015 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS ENTITIES ARE ABLE

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.482 region:rollup2
THEN MATCH THAT UP WITH THEIR

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:28.249 region:rollup2
OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.951 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENTS.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:31.019 region:rollup2
AND TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF.

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:32.120 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE USING

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:33.588 region:rollup2
UTILIZING THEIR.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.857 region:rollup2
FUNDS WISELY.

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:36.391 region:rollup2
AND HELPING THEM OUT IN

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:38.727 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING IF IF AT ALL

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:40.528 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:42.163 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALSO DRAMATICALLY

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:43.198 region:rollup2
EXPANDED OUR WORKFORCE AND

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.866 region:rollup2
TRAINING COMPONENT.

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:47.135 region:rollup2
OF MY OFFICE.

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:49.437 region:rollup2

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.111 region:rollup2
YA SECRETARY BADGERING AND.

01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:57.645 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND NOT GOTTEN THAT

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:58.379 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.881 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:00.948 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO GET WHERE

01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:02.350 region:rollup2
WE ARE TODAY WITHOUT THAT WE'VE

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:03.217 region:rollup2
NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE.

01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:04.786 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:08.156 region:rollup2
WERE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF

01:37:04.786 --> 01:37:09.490 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT DOES NOT WORK.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:10.558 region:rollup2
THE STRATEGY WHICH WE'VE HAD OF

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:12.994 region:rollup2
THE STATE THUS FAR HAS BEEN.

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:14.295 region:rollup2
ISLANDS OF EXCELLENCE.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:16.731 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:18.299 region:rollup2
LEADS TO ISLANDS OF NEGLECT.

01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:19.934 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING TO NOT BREAK DOWN

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.902 region:rollup2
THOSE SILOS

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:22.270 region:rollup2
AND MOVING FORWARD.

01:37:20.902 --> 01:37:23.671 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:25.206 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE'RE

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:27.008 region:rollup2
DOING THIS NEXT OF THIS YEAR. IS

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:29.077 region:rollup2
PUTTING TOGETHER A OF LONG TERM

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:30.445 region:rollup2
STRATEGY WHICH FALLS UNDER THE

01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:31.913 region:rollup2
VISION TWENTY TWENTY PLAN.

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:32.980 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS A STATE

01:37:31.913 --> 01:37:34.449 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSECURITY

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.284 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO AND

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:37.351 region:rollup2
STATE WHAT IS AND STATE LOOK AT.

01:37:36.284 --> 01:37:39.153 region:rollup2
WHERE RIGHT NOW ARE LOOK LIKE

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:41.489 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS?

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:43.958 region:rollup2
FOR OR PARTNERS AND OUR.

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:45.259 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP NEVER

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.627 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY ROLLING THAT OUT.

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:47.628 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR.

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:49.597 region:rollup2
AND.

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:51.032 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEE WHERE

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.999 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING NOTHING GETS A KEY

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:53.167 region:rollup2
COMPONENT SPECIALTY TRY TO

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:55.937 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT. DOESN'T FIT WITHIN

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:56.571 region:rollup2
THE BCP ARE THEY ASKING FOR THE

01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:57.472 region:rollup2
RIGHT THINGS THINGS ALONG THOSE

01:37:56.571 --> 01:37:58.773 region:rollup2
LINES.

01:37:57.472 --> 01:37:59.774 region:rollup2
TOGETHER COURSE QUESTIONS JUST

01:37:58.773 --> 01:38:02.510 region:rollup2
ANSWERING THOSE QUICKLY.

01:37:59.774 --> 01:38:04.746 region:rollup2
MISSING TOOLS ABSOLUTELY.

01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:06.114 region:rollup2
BUT WERE AWARE OF IT AND THIS

01:38:04.746 --> 01:38:07.815 region:rollup2
IS AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

01:38:06.114 --> 01:38:09.550 region:rollup2
WE'RE BUILDING TOWARDS.

01:38:07.815 --> 01:38:11.018 region:rollup2
BLASPHEMY WANNA DO GOING TO

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:12.587 region:rollup2
YOUR OTHER QUESTION WHICHIS ARE

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:14.055 region:rollup2
THERE TOOLS WE DO NOT UTILIZE.

01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:15.656 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THE TOOLS

01:38:14.055 --> 01:38:17.525 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES WE NEED AND THEN

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:18.826 region:rollup2
ITERATIVELY AND AND THOUGHTFULLY

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:20.561 region:rollup2
PUTTING TOGETHER STRATEGY OF HOW

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:21.996 region:rollup2
WE ROLL THOSE OUT WILL PREVENT

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:23.164 region:rollup2
US FROM HAVING TOOLS THEY JUST

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.565 region:rollup2
SIT ON THE SHELF.

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:26.234 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S OUR STRATEGY THUS

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:27.468 region:rollup2
FAR SPECIAL THE.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.036 region:rollup2
SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.904 region:rollup2
AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL BE

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:30.638 region:rollup2
INCREASING CAPABILITY AND

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:33.174 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:34.609 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE.

01:38:33.174 --> 01:38:36.344 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE OF

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:37.412 region:rollup2
THAT'LL THINK I I BELIEVE PASS

01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:39.747 region:rollup2
IT OVER TO.

01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:41.783 region:rollup2

ADDRESSING THE INDEPENDENT

01:38:58.065 --> 01:39:01.035 region:rollup2
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND HOW

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.336 region:rollup2
THOSE HAVE BEEN GOING OVER THE

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:04.939 region:rollup2
LAST TWO YEARS.

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:06.240 region:rollup2
FOR STARTERS A SHORT OVERVIEW.

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:07.975 region:rollup2
AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.277 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS A VERY TECHNICAL

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:11.913 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF AN AGENCIES

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:14.215 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. TO

01:39:11.913 --> 01:39:16.083 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVELY THEY

01:39:14.215 --> 01:39:17.919 region:rollup2
ARE MANAGING THOSE SYSTEMS AND

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:19.454 region:rollup2
THEIR CYBERSECURITY MATURITY. AS

01:39:17.919 --> 01:39:22.356 region:rollup2
MR LABOR LIKES TO CALL IT.

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:24.392 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD AGREE SO.

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:25.760 region:rollup2
THINK THE CRITERIA THE CRITERIA

01:39:24.392 --> 01:39:28.029 region:rollup2
THAT WE USE IN THESE ASSESSMENTS

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.764 region:rollup2
WE WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO

01:39:28.029 --> 01:39:31.432 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THOSE WITH THE.

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:33.067 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:34.335 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE CHAU CONTROLS OR

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:36.237 region:rollup2
THE CI SO CONTROLS THOSE

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:37.171 region:rollup2
CRITERIA WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:38.739 region:rollup2
INTO THE CRITERIA TO MAKE THEM

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:41.309 region:rollup2
REPEATABLE AND TO GENERATE

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:42.944 region:rollup2
METRICS FOR WHICH WE CAN USE TO.

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:44.178 region:rollup2
GAUGE THE CYBERSECURITY

01:39:42.944 --> 01:39:45.279 region:rollup2
MATURITY IN THE AGENCIES THAT WE

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:47.582 region:rollup2
VISITED.

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:48.883 region:rollup2
AND AS MR LABOR INDICATED MANY

01:39:47.582 --> 01:39:50.685 region:rollup2
OF THOSE WILL.

01:39:48.883 --> 01:39:51.953 region:rollup2
TIE RIGHT INTO HIS CYBERSECURITY

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:54.989 region:rollup2
METRICS THAT HE HAS DEVELOPED.

01:39:51.953 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup2
.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:57.892 region:rollup2
SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THEM

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:59.827 region:rollup2
MILITARY APARTMENT FOR THE SIMON

01:39:57.892 --> 01:40:00.928 region:rollup2
OUR DEFENSE TEAM WE'VE BEEN TO

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.697 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:04.498 region:rollup2
THIRTY ENTITIES.

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:06.901 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE OF THOSE WAR A

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.903 region:rollup2
NONTRADITIONAL STATE AGENCIES

01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:10.805 region:rollup2
SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

01:40:08.903 --> 01:40:12.473 region:rollup2
A C. ISSUE OR ACCOUNTING THOSE

01:40:10.805 --> 01:40:13.541 region:rollup2
TYPES OF ENTITIES SO WE'VE BEEN

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:15.343 region:rollup2
TO A FEW OF THOSE.

01:40:13.541 --> 01:40:17.578 region:rollup2
WE HAVE COMPLETED OVER A

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:17.778 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AYE ESSAYS TODAY AND

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.080 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:20.815 region:rollup2
.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:23.351 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR

01:40:20.815 --> 01:40:24.819 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE'VE ANALYZED

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:27.288 region:rollup2
AND SCAN AND ABOUT SIXTY

01:40:24.819 --> 01:40:28.689 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STATE THAT.

01:40:27.288 --> 01:40:31.125 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:32.760 region:rollup2
SO OUR PERSPECTIVE AFTER HAVING

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:34.662 region:rollup2
DONE THESE ASSESSMENTS.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.730 region:rollup2
FROM AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL YOU'VE

01:40:34.662 --> 01:40:38.966 region:rollup2
HEARD THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:41.469 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE CAL SICK AND THE

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:42.703 region:rollup2
CDT SOCK AND AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:44.572 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE GREAT THEY REALLY

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:46.707 region:rollup2
HARDEN THE EXTERIOR THEY

01:40:44.572 --> 01:40:48.476 region:rollup2
PROTECTED PERIMETER. AND THEY

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:49.644 region:rollup2
HAVE VISIBILITY TO THE INSIDE

01:40:48.476 --> 01:40:51.979 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S CRITICAL.

01:40:49.644 --> 01:40:53.281 region:rollup2
THAT IS DEFINITELY A COMPONENT

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:55.082 region:rollup2
THAT'S REQUIRED FROM AN

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:56.651 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE YOU ALSO

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:57.919 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT THE OFFICE THREE

01:40:56.651 --> 01:40:59.587 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE MINUTES EMAIL

01:40:57.919 --> 01:41:01.522 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT. AND ALL OF THE MAIL

01:40:59.587 --> 01:41:03.724 region:rollup2
BOXES THAT GO IN THERE AND THAT

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:06.294 region:rollup2
IS AN ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT THAT

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:07.662 region:rollup2
REACHES EVERY SINGLE USER. SO

01:41:06.294 --> 01:41:09.430 region:rollup2
EVERY USER'S MAILBOX.

01:41:07.662 --> 01:41:11.699 region:rollup2
GAINES THE PROTECTIONS FROM THE

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.899 region:rollup2
OFFICE THREE SIXTY FIVE POLICIES

01:41:11.699 --> 01:41:14.201 region:rollup2
AND.

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:14.669 region:rollup2
SECURITIES CONTROLS ARE IN

01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.671 region:rollup2
PLACE. AND THAT'S VERY

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:18.606 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:41:16.671 --> 01:41:20.875 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

01:41:18.606 --> 01:41:23.477 region:rollup2
ATTACKERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:25.680 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NEED TO COMPROMISE

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:27.148 region:rollup2
THE MONOLITHIC DATABASE WITH ALL

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.250 region:rollup2
THE HIGH TECH SECURITY CONTROLS

01:41:27.148 --> 01:41:30.584 region:rollup2
AND MONITORING. THEY JUST NEED

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:32.086 region:rollup2
TO COMPROMISE THE USER.

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:33.588 region:rollup2
THE USER HAS ACCESS TO THAT DATA

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:35.756 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE USER USES THAT DATA

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:37.158 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY SO THEY COMPROMISE A

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:38.793 region:rollup2
STANDARD USER AND THEN THEY GAIN

01:41:37.158 --> 01:41:40.861 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ALL THE DATA THAT

01:41:38.793 --> 01:41:42.597 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. SO FROM.

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:43.497 region:rollup2
MOST SECURITY PROFESSIONALS

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.832 region:rollup2
WOULD TELL YOU THAT THE

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:47.568 region:rollup2
PERIMETER REALLY HAS SHIFTED

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:49.236 region:rollup2
FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE NETWORK.

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:50.338 region:rollup2
TO EACH AND EVERY DESKTOP EACH

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:52.039 region:rollup2
AND EVERY USER IS NOW THE

01:41:50.338 --> 01:41:53.040 region:rollup2
SECURITY FROM.

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:54.308 region:rollup2
SO PROTECTING EACH OF THOSE

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.977 region:rollup2
USERS AS YOU MENTIONED THIS

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:57.211 region:rollup2
MORNING MA'AM WE NEED TRAINING

01:41:55.977 --> 01:41:57.812 region:rollup2
FOR THE USERS BECAUSE THERE

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.413 region:rollup2
GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE THE

01:41:57.812 --> 01:42:01.649 region:rollup2
WEAKEST LINK.

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:03.050 region:rollup2
SO THAT TAKES US TO INDIVIDUAL

01:42:01.649 --> 01:42:04.952 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND THE FOCUS OF THE

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:05.519 region:rollup2
AYE A SAY AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:09.423 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:11.392 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASE AND

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:13.461 region:rollup2
SENIOR LEADERS AND THE

01:42:11.392 --> 01:42:15.162 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OR IN AGENCIES

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:15.997 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON CYBERSECURITY

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:17.298 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MORE AWARE OF WHAT'S

01:42:15.997 --> 01:42:18.933 region:rollup2
GOING ON AND IT'S A HIGHER

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:20.901 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR THEM. SO THEY'RE

01:42:18.933 --> 01:42:22.403 region:rollup2
WILLING TO DEDICATE RESOURCES TO

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:23.738 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE PATCHING WHICH IS

01:42:22.403 --> 01:42:25.206 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

01:42:23.738 --> 01:42:26.273 region:rollup2
EQUIFAX I THINK WOULD TELL YOU

01:42:25.206 --> 01:42:27.742 region:rollup2
THAT THEY REALLY WISH THEY HAD

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:29.076 region:rollup2
PATCH THAT APACHE STRUTS

01:42:27.742 --> 01:42:30.811 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY.

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.379 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.480 region:rollup2
THAT WISH THEY WERE TO PASS

01:42:31.379 --> 01:42:35.650 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.885 region:rollup2
SO.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.986 region:rollup2
PATCHING IS HARD.

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:40.454 region:rollup2
PATCHING SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:41.989 region:rollup2
IT TAKES.

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:44.058 region:rollup2
NOT JUST PEOPLE IT TAKES THE

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:45.760 region:rollup2
RIGHT SECURITY PEOPLE TO MANAGE

01:42:44.058 --> 01:42:47.495 region:rollup2
THOSE SYSTEMS AND TO PATCH ALL

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.095 region:rollup2
THE COMPUTERS AND ALL THE.

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:49.764 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PASSED

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:51.699 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY SO IT'S A RESOURCE

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:53.734 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE PROCESS. AND I THINK

01:42:51.699 --> 01:42:55.002 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ARE BECOMING AWARE.

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.137 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AFTER WE SCANNED

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:57.838 region:rollup2
THEM THAT THEY NEED TO APPLY

01:42:56.137 --> 01:42:58.939 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO THOSE TO TO PATCH

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:00.341 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES AND TO DO THAT

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:01.375 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:04.045 region:rollup2
AGAIN KIND OF IN THE WEEDS.

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:05.513 region:rollup2
.

01:43:04.045 --> 01:43:07.081 region:rollup2
WE'RE FINDING FEWER UNSUPPORTED

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:09.283 region:rollup2
OPERATING SYSTEMS.

01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:10.851 region:rollup2
WINDOWS XP IS FINALLY GOING

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:12.653 region:rollup2
AWAY STRAIGHT OUT OF SUPPORT FOR

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:13.654 region:rollup2
YEARS AND YEARS AND IT'S FINALLY

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:13.854 region:rollup2
LEAVING THE NETWORKS THAT'S

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:16.323 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:18.526 region:rollup2
.

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:19.527 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT

01:43:18.526 --> 01:43:20.594 region:rollup2
A LOT OUT OF THE BOX

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:22.296 region:rollup2
CONFIGURATIONS WHERE AGENCIES

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:23.597 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:24.832 region:rollup2
AND SAW THE OPERATING SYSTEM AND

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:26.233 region:rollup2
JUST GO WITH THAT THEY JUST

01:43:24.832 --> 01:43:27.835 region:rollup2
LEAVE IT AS A KIND OF THE BOX.

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.869 region:rollup2
AND OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE

01:43:27.835 --> 01:43:30.304 region:rollup2
GENERALLY CONFIGURED SO THEY

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:31.906 region:rollup2
WORK WELL FOR YOU AT HOME

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:33.374 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT USUALLY CONSIDER

01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:35.176 region:rollup2
CONFIGURED VERY WELL TO WORK IN

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:36.577 region:rollup2
AN ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT. SO

01:43:35.176 --> 01:43:37.712 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GET A SYSTEM OUT OF THE

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:39.013 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE BOX AS IT WERE YOU

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:40.481 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONFIGURE IT TO BE

01:43:39.013 --> 01:43:41.949 region:rollup2
SECURING ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT

01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:43.851 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE FINDING THAT AGENCIES

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.718 region:rollup2
ARE ARE STARTING TO FOCUS ON.

01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:52.159 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY GOOD FINING.

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:53.360 region:rollup2
.

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:56.030 region:rollup2
I'M OLD AND MY EYES ARE FAMOUS.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.997 region:rollup2
A.

01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:58.766 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:59.266 region:rollup2
REALLY EXCITED TO FIND RECENTLY

01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:02.103 region:rollup2
IS WERE STARTING TO SEE

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:04.505 region:rollup2
ADVANCED.

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:06.874 region:rollup2
NEXT GENERATION AND A VIRUS ON

01:44:04.505 --> 01:44:10.244 region:rollup2
THE IN POINTS.

01:44:06.874 --> 01:44:12.646 region:rollup2
SO ANTI VIRUS TEN YEARS AGO WAS

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:14.949 region:rollup2
A SIGNATURE BASED EVENT WHERE.

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:17.084 region:rollup2
IT KNEW WHAT MOST OF THE VIRUSES

01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:18.686 region:rollup2
LOOKED LIKE BASED ON.

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.553 region:rollup2
THE CONTENTS OF THE FILES AND IT

01:44:18.686 --> 01:44:20.321 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST LOOK IN THE

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:22.123 region:rollup2
SIGNATURES TO SEE IF YOU HAD A

01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:25.192 region:rollup2
VIRUS.

01:44:22.123 --> 01:44:26.560 region:rollup2
I THINK THE NUMBER IS THERE ARE

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:28.129 region:rollup2
ON THE ORDER OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.463 region:rollup2
NEW.

01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:31.565 region:rollup2
VIRUSES OR MALWARE SAMPLES EVERY

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:33.400 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF MINUTES.

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:34.468 region:rollup2
SO THE SIGNATURE BASED AND IRIS

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.102 region:rollup2
ISN'T PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:35.736 region:rollup2
ANYMORE.

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:40.674 region:rollup2
SO THAT ARE OURS THAT'S CAPABLE

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:42.376 region:rollup2
OF

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:44.879 region:rollup2
SPOTTING THINGS THAT IT HASN'T

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:47.615 region:rollup2
SEEN BEFORE IT'S CAPABLE OF

01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:49.016 region:rollup2
PREVENTING EXECUTIONS OF. OR

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:50.017 region:rollup2
PREVENTING EXECUTION AND NOW

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:52.820 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:54.889 region:rollup2
AND ALERTING CENTRALLY SO.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:56.524 region:rollup2
AND DAY AND DAYS PASSED THE

01:44:54.889 --> 01:44:58.325 region:rollup2
WORKSTATIONS ARE THE SYSTEMS ON

01:44:56.524 --> 01:44:58.893 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK OR A BLACK HOLE.

01:44:58.325 --> 01:45:00.294 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE USER'S

01:44:58.893 --> 01:45:02.062 region:rollup2
WORKSTATION?

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:03.597 region:rollup2
AND TELL WAS REALLY BAD NOBODY

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:05.599 region:rollup2
HAD ANY IDEA NO ONE SAW THAT

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:06.233 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN STATE GOVERNMENTS AND

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.701 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S IN THE

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:09.303 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL WORLD. IN THE PAST

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:11.472 region:rollup2
THAT WAS HUGE PROBLEM.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:13.207 region:rollup2
NOW YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:14.642 region:rollup2
EACH AND EVERY WORKSTATION.

01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:15.776 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE EACH

01:45:14.642 --> 01:45:16.977 region:rollup2
WORKSTATION IS BECOMING THE

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:18.312 region:rollup2
PERIMETER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:20.247 region:rollup2
THE ATTACKERS ARE ATTACKING SO

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:21.849 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM ON

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:23.918 region:rollup2
EACH INDIVIDUAL WORKSTATION.

01:45:21.849 --> 01:45:25.286 region:rollup2
THAT CAN DETECT THAT ACTIVITY

01:45:23.918 --> 01:45:26.453 region:rollup2
AND REPORT IT TO A SECURITY

01:45:25.286 --> 01:45:28.622 region:rollup2
ENGINEER THAT CAN RESPOND TO IT

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:30.024 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY FASHION.

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:31.792 region:rollup2
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE AND

01:45:30.024 --> 01:45:34.528 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:34.728 region:rollup2
SEE AT. AN ENTERPRISE ROLLOUT OF

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:35.095 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.330 region:rollup2
.

01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:38.566 region:rollup2
TO SEE.

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:40.334 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:45:38.566 --> 01:45:42.236 region:rollup2
THE CDT THAT THE CD TO SOCK THE

01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:43.037 region:rollup2
CALTECH THOSE. ENTITIES CAN

01:45:42.236 --> 01:45:45.005 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEE ON WORKSTATIONS

01:45:43.037 --> 01:45:47.741 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:51.579 region:rollup2
.

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:53.280 region:rollup2
GO THAT MYSELF BOXER AND.

01:45:51.579 --> 01:45:54.582 region:rollup2
SO AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH OUR

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.549 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT SECURITY SYSTEMS WE

01:45:54.582 --> 01:45:57.051 region:rollup2
GATHER A LOT OF DATA WE DO ALL

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:58.452 region:rollup2
THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:45:57.051 --> 01:46:00.120 region:rollup2
OFFER TO AGENCIES TO TRY AND ADD

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:01.188 region:rollup2
VALUE IS WE HAVE A COUPLE IS

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:03.524 region:rollup2
SECURITY ENGINEERS THAT ARE

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:05.626 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD AT POLICY BASED.

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:07.161 region:rollup2
HARDENING OF SYSTEMS SO THAT WE

01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:08.462 region:rollup2
WE OFFER TO GO BACK TO THE

01:46:07.161 --> 01:46:10.464 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND SIT DOWN WITH THEM

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:12.233 region:rollup2
AND TRY AND. WALK THEM DOWN THAT

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:13.567 region:rollup2
PATH THAT ALSO A COMPLICATED

01:46:12.233 --> 01:46:16.537 region:rollup2
PATH TO STROLL DOWN.

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:17.738 region:rollup2
SO WE PROVIDE SUPPORT THAT WAY

01:46:16.537 --> 01:46:19.139 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD ELEVEN AGENCIES THAT

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.541 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN US UP ON THAT SO WE

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:22.009 region:rollup2
DO GO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO SOME

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:23.344 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AT THEIR REQUEST.

01:46:22.009 --> 01:46:23.844 region:rollup2
AFTER WE'VE DONE THE

01:46:23.344 --> 01:46:27.214 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS WITH THEM.

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:28.782 region:rollup2
.

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:30.584 region:rollup2
AFTER THE ASSESSMENT COMPLETELY

01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:32.453 region:rollup2
DONE WE'VE STARTED PROVIDING A

01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:33.621 region:rollup2
SURVEY TO SEE HOW WE'VE. HOW

01:46:32.453 --> 01:46:34.755 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IN THE IN THE

01:46:33.621 --> 01:46:36.323 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENT

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:37.291 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND WHAT THE AGENCIES

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:38.959 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK WAS?

01:46:37.291 --> 01:46:40.427 region:rollup2
SO FAR NINETY PERCENT OF THE

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:42.363 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TO HAVE

01:46:40.427 --> 01:46:43.197 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WE.

01:46:42.363 --> 01:46:44.832 region:rollup2
IN THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY

01:46:43.197 --> 01:46:46.500 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT PROCESS HAVE HELP

01:46:44.832 --> 01:46:48.302 region:rollup2
THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CYBER

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.136 region:rollup2
RISK IN THEIR NETWORK.

01:46:48.302 --> 01:46:49.737 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S GOOD THING IF

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:50.905 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT AWARE HE CAN'T FIX

01:46:49.737 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
IT.

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:54.675 region:rollup2
.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:57.344 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:46:54.675 --> 01:46:59.113 region:rollup2
MY FINAL POINT WOULD BE. THE.

01:46:57.344 --> 01:47:01.148 region:rollup2
COR FOR PARTNERS.

01:46:59.113 --> 01:47:03.417 region:rollup2
WE GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH THE

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:05.753 region:rollup2
OTHER THREE PARTNERS AND I THINK

01:47:03.417 --> 01:47:07.288 region:rollup2
THAT. AS MR LEAVITT SAID

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:09.423 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY.

01:47:07.288 --> 01:47:10.724 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A JOURNEY AND IT'S A

01:47:09.423 --> 01:47:13.861 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLICATED JOURNEY

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:14.528 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY CYBERSECURITY IS

01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:16.096 region:rollup2
NOT A LINE ITEM ON A QUOTE IT'S

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:16.964 region:rollup2
NOT A CHECKBOX

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:18.832 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A BINDER OVER IN THE

01:47:16.964 --> 01:47:20.734 region:rollup2
CORNER. IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:22.202 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A VERY LONG PATH. AND I

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:23.871 region:rollup2
THINK THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS WHO

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:25.239 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING VERY WELL TOGETHER

01:47:23.871 --> 01:47:26.807 region:rollup2
AND ADDING ADDITIONAL PARTNERS

01:47:25.239 --> 01:47:28.108 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS AND I THINK WE'RE

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:29.977 region:rollup2
MAKING SOME STRIDES DOWN THAT

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:30.577 region:rollup2
PATH LETTER THAT WERE REALLY

01:47:29.977 --> 01:47:30.778 region:rollup2
GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:30.911 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:47:30.778 --> 01:47:32.980 region:rollup2
.

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:33.781 region:rollup2
WE'RE.

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.382 region:rollup2
AND DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING

01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:36.717 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:37.284 region:rollup2
THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I THINK WE

01:47:36.717 --> 01:47:40.187 region:rollup2
NEED TO PROTECT THE DATA THE

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:41.588 region:rollup2
CITIZENS.

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:43.590 region:rollup2
THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:45.492 region:rollup2
LIEUTENANT COLONEL PARSONS A

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:47.328 region:rollup2
FINAL LET'S GO TO ALL THE LAST

CHIEF SCOTT HOW ONE FROM THE

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:58.405 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND

01:47:56.537 --> 01:47:59.606 region:rollup2
AND I BASICALLY WERE TWO HATS

01:47:58.405 --> 01:48:00.874 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THAT IS AS CHIEF

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:02.443 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OFFICER AND I'M

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:04.912 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C. H. P.'S

01:48:02.443 --> 01:48:06.246 region:rollup2
IT. AND MAKE SURE WERE SECURE

01:48:04.912 --> 01:48:07.514 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SECOND HAT WHICH

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:09.483 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SCARES THE GUY WITH THE

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:11.018 region:rollup2
FIRST THAT. IS OVERSEE OUR

01:48:09.483 --> 01:48:12.686 region:rollup2
COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS

01:48:11.018 --> 01:48:14.021 region:rollup2
UNIT BECAUSE I SEE ALL THE STUFF

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:15.322 region:rollup2
THAT GOES WRONG AND WANT TO MAKE

01:48:14.021 --> 01:48:16.357 region:rollup2
SURE IT DOESN'T GO WRONG ON MY

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:17.658 region:rollup2
OWN NETWORK.

01:48:16.357 --> 01:48:18.926 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:20.494 region:rollup2
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE I WANT TO

01:48:18.926 --> 01:48:22.629 region:rollup2
START WITH PAINTING A PICTURE OF

01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:24.398 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:25.632 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY. BECAUSE

01:48:24.398 --> 01:48:28.068 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT HOW WE APPROACH

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:29.036 region:rollup2
COMPUTER CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
WE BASICALLY WE GET A CALL OF

01:48:29.036 --> 01:48:32.906 region:rollup2
MINUTES THAT. WE RESPOND TO THAT

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:34.575 region:rollup2
AGENCY WOULD INVESTIGATE THAT

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:37.011 region:rollup2
CRIME AND THEN CD TEASE

01:48:34.575 --> 01:48:37.644 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICE

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:38.779 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NOTIFIED AND THEY TAKE

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:40.514 region:rollup2
A STEP.

01:48:38.779 --> 01:48:41.915 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE GAIN FROM AT

01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:44.051 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE WE LEARNED DID NOT

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:46.186 region:rollup2
GO ANYWHERE.

01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:47.755 region:rollup2
TODAY WHEN WE GET A CALL AS SOON

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:49.390 region:rollup2
AS WE START THAT INVESTIGATION

01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:51.125 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE ANY INTELLIGENCE THAT

01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:51.925 region:rollup2
COULD BE A PHISHING EMAIL

01:48:51.125 --> 01:48:53.360 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT WE NEED TO WHAT

01:48:51.925 --> 01:48:55.362 region:rollup2
LOOK OUT FOR COULD BE A BAD

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.864 region:rollup2
WEBSITE. THAT INFORMATION GETS

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:58.632 region:rollup2
PUSHED OF THE CAL SICK WHICH

01:48:56.864 --> 01:49:00.734 region:rollup2
THEN PUSHES OUT INCLUDING THE

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:02.770 region:rollup2
SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER SO

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:04.304 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN BE PROACTIVE AND WE

01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:05.339 region:rollup2
CAN START DEFENDING OURSELVES

01:49:04.304 --> 01:49:06.707 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN PLAYING CATCH UP

01:49:05.339 --> 01:49:08.175 region:rollup2
WITH IT.

01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:10.210 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THAT

01:49:08.175 --> 01:49:11.044 region:rollup2
THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION HAS

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:13.747 region:rollup2
REALLY MOVE THE STATE OF

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:15.349 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FROM A REACTIVE MODE.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:16.850 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING HAPPENED AND NOW

01:49:15.349 --> 01:49:17.985 region:rollup2
WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP TO A THEY

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:19.486 region:rollup2
WERE GETTING INDICATORS OF

01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:20.954 region:rollup2
SOMETHING GOING ON. WE NEED TO

01:49:19.486 --> 01:49:22.623 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME ACTION AND WE HAVE THE

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:24.558 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY

01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:25.793 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT AIM THAT ACTION AND A

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:27.194 region:rollup2
GREAT PART OF THE CAL SIC IS A

01:49:25.793 --> 01:49:28.662 region:rollup2
SURE WAY BEYOND THE STATE

01:49:27.194 --> 01:49:29.963 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISE LEVEL. AND SO ALL THE

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:31.265 region:rollup2
LOCAL PARTNERS AND FEDERAL

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:32.866 region:rollup2
PARTNERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE CAN

01:49:31.265 --> 01:49:33.734 region:rollup2
GAIN THAT INFORMATION THAT WE

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:36.303 region:rollup2
SHARE.

01:49:33.734 --> 01:49:37.905 region:rollup2
I I WANT TO SPEND MY TIME REALLY

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:40.007 region:rollup2
WALKING THROUGH SOME.

01:49:37.905 --> 01:49:42.209 region:rollup2
STACKS AS FAR AS WHAT WE GET

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:42.676 region:rollup2
INVOLVED AND IN THE AC INCIDENTS

01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:44.178 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:45.612 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND I'M GONNA DO A

01:49:44.178 --> 01:49:47.381 region:rollup2
COMPARISON BETWEEN TWENTY

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:49.249 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO

01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:50.651 region:rollup2
GIVE A GOOD IDEA THE TRENDS THAT

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.718 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING.

01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:52.753 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT ALSO DOES A GOOD

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:54.455 region:rollup2
JOB PAINTING THE PICTURE OF THE

01:49:52.753 --> 01:49:56.723 region:rollup2
PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING.

01:49:54.455 --> 01:49:57.925 region:rollup2
SO. CALIFORNIA USES THE

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:59.059 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMPLIANCE AND

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:01.929 region:rollup2
SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:04.298 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THE CAL CAESAR SYSTEM TO

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:05.999 region:rollup2
START A TO MAKE NOTIFICATIONS OF

01:50:04.298 --> 01:50:07.401 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:09.570 region:rollup2
EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT IS.

01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:10.871 region:rollup2
ONLINE WITH THAT SYSTEM AND THE

01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:12.940 region:rollup2
BEAUTIFUL PART ABOUT THAT SYSTEM

01:50:10.871 --> 01:50:14.808 region:rollup2
IS AS SOON AS A DEPARTMENT MAKES

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:17.744 region:rollup2
A REPORT THAT REPORT COMES TO

01:50:14.808 --> 01:50:19.113 region:rollup2
THE CHP. IT GOES TO THE CAL SICK

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:20.681 region:rollup2
IT GOES TO TECHNOLOGY.

01:50:19.113 --> 01:50:22.583 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY KNOWS AT THE SAME TIME

01:50:20.681 --> 01:50:23.884 region:rollup2
THAT A DISSIDENT A STARTING NOW

01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:25.119 region:rollup2
REALIZE WITHIN THAT SYSTEM IT

01:50:23.884 --> 01:50:26.487 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A PAPER BASED

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:28.055 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SECURITY LOSS IN

01:50:26.487 --> 01:50:29.156 region:rollup2
WHICH CASE INFORMATION SECURITY

01:50:28.055 --> 01:50:30.591 region:rollup2
OFFICE WOULD BE THE ONLY FOLKS

01:50:29.156 --> 01:50:31.558 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD FOLLOW UP ON IT. BUT

01:50:30.591 --> 01:50:33.627 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:34.628 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY IF IT'S CRIMINAL WE

01:50:33.627 --> 01:50:36.530 region:rollup2
WILL IMMEDIATELY JUMP ON BOARD

01:50:34.628 --> 01:50:37.331 region:rollup2
WITH IT IF THERE'S FOLLOW UP OR

01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:39.099 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE IN NEEDS TO BE

01:50:37.331 --> 01:50:40.367 region:rollup2
SHARED. HOW SICK IS ON BOARD

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:41.869 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY KNOWING THAT HEY

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.936 region:rollup2
SOMETHING'S COMING AND THEN

01:50:41.869 --> 01:50:44.805 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING AND SHARING THAT

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:46.106 region:rollup2
INFORMATION? AND SO AS WE LOOK

01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:47.241 region:rollup2
AT THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:49.009 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:50:47.241 --> 01:50:50.811 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID SEE AN

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:52.613 region:rollup2
INCREASE PLAN OVERALL CAL

01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:53.981 region:rollup2
CAESAR'S REPORTS WE WENT FROM

01:50:52.613 --> 01:50:55.182 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE TO

01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:58.118 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT. BUT

01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:59.953 region:rollup2
REMEMBER WITHIN THOSE REPORTS

01:50:58.118 --> 01:51:02.322 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE PAPER

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:04.658 region:rollup2
LOSS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:05.659 region:rollup2
INCLUDES OF THEFT OR LOSS OF

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:06.593 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT INCLUDING CELLPHONES.

01:51:05.659 --> 01:51:08.529 region:rollup2
SO PURPOSES OF TODAY WHEN I CAN

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:09.263 region:rollup2
REALLY DO IS TAKE THAT THAT BIG

01:51:08.529 --> 01:51:11.932 region:rollup2
GLOBAL.

01:51:09.263 --> 01:51:13.667 region:rollup2
STATISTIC AND REALLY FOCUS ON

01:51:11.932 --> 01:51:15.269 region:rollup2
FOR COOPER THREE CATEGORIES MALL

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:16.737 region:rollup2
WHERE INFECTIONS THAT HIT STATE

01:51:15.269 --> 01:51:18.338 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS.

01:51:16.737 --> 01:51:19.239 region:rollup2
A SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND FISHING

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:20.741 region:rollup2
AND THE DENIAL OF SERVICE

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:22.176 region:rollup2
ATTACKS AND I THINK THAT'LL PAIN

01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:23.477 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD PICTURE.

01:51:22.176 --> 01:51:25.112 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE DID GET TO THOSE KEY

01:51:23.477 --> 01:51:26.780 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD

01:51:25.112 --> 01:51:28.482 region:rollup2
NEWS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR MALL

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:30.083 region:rollup2
WHERE INFECTIONS INFECTIONS ON

01:51:28.482 --> 01:51:31.418 region:rollup2
STATE COMPUTERS WE SIDE DROP

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.486 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:34.388 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY TWENTY FIVE

01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:36.156 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:51:34.388 --> 01:51:37.791 region:rollup2
WE WENT FROM FIFTY EIGHT. AND

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:39.593 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN TO FORTY THREE

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:40.694 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

01:51:39.593 --> 01:51:42.429 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S AN INDICATOR OF

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:43.730 region:rollup2
PROGRESS AND ANY TIME YOU HAVE

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:45.299 region:rollup2
INFECTIONS GOING DOWN IT'S A

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:47.067 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD THING.

01:51:45.299 --> 01:51:48.135 region:rollup2
SOME MORE GOOD NEWS AND I THINK

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:50.704 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY REALLY

01:51:48.135 --> 01:51:54.308 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT WE SAW SEVENTY NINE

01:51:50.704 --> 01:51:54.308 region:rollup2
PERCENT DECREASE IN RANSOMWARE

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:57.511 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE PERCENT WE ALL KNOW

01:51:56.343 --> 01:51:59.179 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GLOBAL TREND HAS BEEN

01:51:57.511 --> 01:52:00.480 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST YEAR IT IS NOT

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:02.216 region:rollup2
BEEN PRETTY AND IT HAS BEEN

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.450 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING STRAIGHT UP. IN

01:52:02.216 --> 01:52:05.052 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN WE ACTUALLY AT

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:06.820 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR CASES OF RANSOMWARE

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:09.923 region:rollup2
ON STATE ASSETS IN TWENTY

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:10.424 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. WE HAD FIVE.

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:11.725 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT SHOWS GREAT

01:52:10.424 --> 01:52:13.260 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

01:52:11.725 --> 01:52:14.795 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SAY WERE

01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:16.563 region:rollup2
DOWN IN ALL CATEGORIES

01:52:14.795 --> 01:52:17.864 region:rollup2
WHICH TAKES ME TO SOCIAL

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:18.565 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING AND FISHING AND I

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.900 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:21.835 region:rollup2
SURPRISED THAT THAT NUMBER IS

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:22.636 region:rollup2
NOT DOWN. AND IT WAS INTERESTING

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:24.271 region:rollup2
WE RECENTLY WERE HAVING A

01:52:22.636 --> 01:52:25.939 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT FISHING IN

01:52:24.271 --> 01:52:27.374 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT ARE OUR NUMBER WAS

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.675 region:rollup2
UP AND WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE

01:52:27.374 --> 01:52:30.210 region:rollup2
DEBATE ABOUT IS THAT A GOOD SIGN

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:31.278 region:rollup2
OR A BAD SIGN.

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:33.547 region:rollup2
BUT LET ME PUT FISHING IN

01:52:31.278 --> 01:52:35.048 region:rollup2
CONTEXT I READ A REPORT RECENTLY

01:52:33.547 --> 01:52:36.950 region:rollup2
THAT CAME FROM FISH ME. AND IT

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:38.518 region:rollup2
SAID IN THE LAST YEAR FISHING

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:40.454 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS I'VE GONE UP SIXTY FIVE

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:42.022 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:52:40.454 --> 01:52:42.756 region:rollup2
THAT IS A HUGE INCREASE AND TO

01:52:42.022 --> 01:52:44.524 region:rollup2
PUT THAT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT IN

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:45.792 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:47.160 region:rollup2
ANOTHER RECENT REPORT I READ IT

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:49.262 region:rollup2
SAYS THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:51.565 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION. UNITS THAT'S THAT

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:52.733 region:rollup2
AGAIN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW

01:52:51.565 --> 01:52:54.468 region:rollup2
FISHING SITES ESTABLISHED

01:52:52.733 --> 01:52:55.736 region:rollup2
MONTHLY.

01:52:54.468 --> 01:52:58.071 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

01:52:55.736 --> 01:52:59.039 region:rollup2
PHISHING EMAILS OUT THERE THAT

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.275 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS BEEN INCREASING

01:52:59.039 --> 01:53:02.309 region:rollup2
EXPONENTIALLY.

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:03.810 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE UP THIRTY SIX PERCENT

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:05.112 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:07.347 region:rollup2
FROM THIRTY SIX

01:53:05.112 --> 01:53:09.349 region:rollup2
THE FORTY NINE.

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:10.984 region:rollup2
VERY LOW NUMBERS.

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:12.352 region:rollup2
BUT WE DUG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:13.787 region:rollup2
IN THAT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT

01:53:12.352 --> 01:53:14.888 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:53:13.787 --> 01:53:16.823 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF THOSE ACTUALLY

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:19.660 region:rollup2
RESULT IN INFECTION?

01:53:16.823 --> 01:53:21.061 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAD THIRTY

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.496 region:rollup2
SIX REPORTED FISHING INCIDENTS

01:53:21.061 --> 01:53:23.563 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

01:53:22.496 --> 01:53:24.965 region:rollup2
OF THEM WORK RESULTED IN

01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:27.234 region:rollup2
INFECTION.

01:53:24.965 --> 01:53:28.835 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD FORTY

01:53:27.234 --> 01:53:31.104 region:rollup2
NINE INCIDENTS REPORTED HIGHER

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:34.007 region:rollup2
NUMBER. BUT ONLY EIGHTEEN MALL

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:35.976 region:rollup2
WHERE INFECTIONS.

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:37.878 region:rollup2
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

01:53:35.976 --> 01:53:38.879 region:rollup2
FISHING IS GOING UP. BUT OUR

01:53:37.878 --> 01:53:40.547 region:rollup2
INFECTIONS RESULTING FROM

01:53:38.879 --> 01:53:42.983 region:rollup2
FISHING IS GOING DOWN.

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:45.052 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT IT SHOWS THAT

01:53:42.983 --> 01:53:46.486 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE REPORTING MORE OFTEN.

01:53:45.052 --> 01:53:48.055 region:rollup2
BUT THE REASON THEY'RE REPORTING

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:49.723 region:rollup2
MORE OFTEN IS THE REPORTING AND

01:53:48.055 --> 01:53:50.757 region:rollup2
NOT FALLING VICTIM.

01:53:49.723 --> 01:53:52.159 region:rollup2
AND ANY TIME WE CAN SAY

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:54.127 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND I'M FALLING VICTIM

01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:54.895 region:rollup2
THAT IS REALLY GOOD. AND I THINK

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:56.730 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN.

01:53:54.895 --> 01:53:57.664 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS BEEN

01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:58.899 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE INDEPENDENT

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:01.334 region:rollup2
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS THEY'VE

01:53:58.899 --> 01:54:02.602 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEEN A REDUCTION.

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:04.371 region:rollup2
IN THE NUMBER OF.

01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:06.940 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT FALL FOR THEIR FAKE%

01:54:04.371 --> 01:54:08.975 region:rollup2
EMAIL SO THEY SENT TO TEST FOX.

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.043 region:rollup2
SO IT IT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:11.712 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING ACROSS

01:54:10.043 --> 01:54:12.612 region:rollup2
THE ENTERPRISE.

01:54:11.712 --> 01:54:13.814 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:15.315 region:rollup2
AS WE ACTUALLY SAW REDUCTION IN

01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:16.416 region:rollup2
DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS WE

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:19.252 region:rollup2
WENT FROM FOUR TO THREE.

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL NUMBERS.

01:54:19.252 --> 01:54:22.222 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PUT

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:24.224 region:rollup2
ALL THIS IN PERSPECTIVE AND.

01:54:22.222 --> 01:54:25.359 region:rollup2
I WAS READING A EUROPEAN UNION

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:27.194 region:rollup2
AGENCY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:28.995 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EUROPE WILL.

01:54:27.194 --> 01:54:30.364 region:rollup2
REPORT FROM LATE LAST YEAR AND

01:54:28.995 --> 01:54:31.598 region:rollup2
THEY SAID RANSOMWARE CONTINUES

01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:32.733 region:rollup2
TO BE ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:34.634 region:rollup2
MALL WHERE THREATS IN TERMS OF

01:54:32.733 --> 01:54:36.203 region:rollup2
THE VARIETY AND RANGE OF ITS

01:54:34.634 --> 01:54:37.404 region:rollup2
VICTIMS AND THE DAMAGE DONE. AND

01:54:36.203 --> 01:54:39.072 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO CONVINCE

01:54:37.404 --> 01:54:41.174 region:rollup2
ANYBODY HERE OF THE DAMAGE THAT

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:42.709 region:rollup2
RANSOMWARE CAN DO. AT AND THEY

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:44.077 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE ATTACKS OF

01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:45.679 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED HOW CAN ACTIVITIES

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:47.481 region:rollup2
OR DIGITAL HYGIENE STANDARDS AND

01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:50.083 region:rollup2
SECURITY PRACTICES CAN ALLOW

01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:51.818 region:rollup2
SUCH A THREAT TO QUICKLY SPREAD.

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:52.853 region:rollup2
AND EXPAND THE ATTACK VECTOR.

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:54.454 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU PUT THOSE NUMBERS

01:54:52.853 --> 01:54:55.922 region:rollup2
IN CONTEXT.

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:57.824 region:rollup2
OF WHAT'S GOING ON WORLDWIDE

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:59.726 region:rollup2
WERE MAKING EXTREMELY GREAT

01:54:57.824 --> 01:55:01.561 region:rollup2
PROGRESS WITH IT BUT IT ALSO

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:02.095 region:rollup2
REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:04.030 region:rollup2
ACTIONS WE'RE TAKING IN

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:05.665 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. GOING BACK TO THOSE

01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:06.566 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:08.502 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:10.570 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES OF WHERE FOLKS

01:55:08.502 --> 01:55:11.104 region:rollup2
CAN GET AND SO WE CAN BE

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:12.172 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE AND CLOSE THOSE

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:13.740 region:rollup2
STORES.

01:55:12.172 --> 01:55:15.275 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TREND THAT EUROPE OR THE

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.710 region:rollup2
EUROPOL REPORT POINTS OUT IS

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:18.211 region:rollup2
FISHING THE MOST COMMONLY

01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:19.579 region:rollup2
FACILITATED THREATS WERE SOCIAL

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:21.848 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING ATTACKS AND CYBER

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:23.116 region:rollup2
FACILITATED FRAUDS SOME REPORTS

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:24.918 region:rollup2
SUGGEST ATTACKERS USE EMAIL TO

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:26.753 region:rollup2
CONTACT THEIR VICTIMS NINETY

01:55:24.918 --> 01:55:28.388 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME.

01:55:26.753 --> 01:55:30.056 region:rollup2
IS THE EASY WAY TO GET IN AND

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:31.291 region:rollup2
ONE SAY SOMEONE GETS THEIR ALL

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:32.325 region:rollup2
LIFE THROUGH ITS CLICK.

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:34.194 region:rollup2
OR PROVIDE INFORMATION AND

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:35.929 region:rollup2
THEREIN.

01:55:34.194 --> 01:55:36.863 region:rollup2
THE SCARIEST THING IS A CHAU OF

01:55:35.929 --> 01:55:38.131 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT I'VE WE'VE GOT

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:40.167 region:rollup2
ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:42.469 region:rollup2
CHP AND ONLY TAKES ONE TO INVITE

01:55:40.167 --> 01:55:43.103 region:rollup2
THE BAD GUY IN. WITH THE MANY

01:55:42.469 --> 01:55:44.271 region:rollup2
MANY FISHING EMAILS THAT ARE OUT

01:55:43.103 --> 01:55:46.406 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:55:44.271 --> 01:55:47.941 region:rollup2
AND I ACTUALLY DO A COMPARISON

01:55:46.406 --> 01:55:49.276 region:rollup2
AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CHP WORKS

01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:50.644 region:rollup2
TIRELESSLY TO.

01:55:49.276 --> 01:55:52.112 region:rollup2
EDUCATE OUR DRIVERS AS FAR AS

01:55:50.644 --> 01:55:52.712 region:rollup2
THE DANGER OF TEXTING AND

01:55:52.112 --> 01:55:54.314 region:rollup2
DRIVING TO MAKE OUR HIGHWAYS

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:55.849 region:rollup2
SAFER. AND I THINK WE REALLY

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:57.484 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT FISHING EMAIL

01:55:55.849 --> 01:55:59.386 region:rollup2
AND USER EDUCATION IN THE SAME

01:55:57.484 --> 01:56:00.921 region:rollup2
WAY THAT IS NOT A ONE TIME FIX

01:55:59.386 --> 01:56:02.689 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S AN ONGOING CAMPAIGN

01:56:00.921 --> 01:56:03.957 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. BECAUSE

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:05.992 region:rollup2
THEY KEEP CHANGING ALL THEIR

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:07.994 region:rollup2
EMAILS MATTER FACT I GOT ONE

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:09.229 region:rollup2
JUST. TWO DAYS AGO THAT

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:10.497 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAID ONE OF MY

01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:12.365 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN LOCKED.

01:56:10.497 --> 01:56:14.267 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS THE COMPANY LOGO WAS

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:16.403 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY TAXED IT LOOKED

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:16.970 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY GOOD.

01:56:16.403 --> 01:56:18.705 region:rollup2
THE THING THAT BECAUSE MY

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:20.073 region:rollup2
INITIAL BOSS I'D JUST BEEN ON

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:21.541 region:rollup2
THAT ACCOUNT AND I'M LIKE MY

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:23.143 region:rollup2
COUNTS NOT LOCKED. AND THEN I

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:26.079 region:rollup2
LOOKED A LITTLE DEEPER AND SURE

01:56:23.143 --> 01:56:27.848 region:rollup2
ENOUGH IT WAS A FISHING EMAIL.

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:29.816 region:rollup2
IT BUT AS WE TALKED EARLIER TO

01:56:27.848 --> 01:56:31.751 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT A

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:33.053 region:rollup2
ONE TIME FIXES AN ONGOING THING

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:35.121 region:rollup2
YOU SPEEDERS TERM IT'S REALLY A

01:56:33.053 --> 01:56:37.691 region:rollup2
MARATHON. AND IT'S REALLY HAVING

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:39.426 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF PEOPLE

01:56:37.691 --> 01:56:40.694 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY.

01:56:39.426 --> 01:56:42.028 region:rollup2
AND THE EXCITING PART IS WE'VE

01:56:40.694 --> 01:56:43.330 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:45.398 region:rollup2
WITH PEOPLE PROCESS AND

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:47.133 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TODAY IN THE PARTNERS

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:48.235 region:rollup2
ARE DOING A FABULOUS JOB OF

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:50.237 region:rollup2
DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

01:56:48.235 --> 01:56:51.304 region:rollup2
REALLY ADDRESS THESE THINGS.

01:56:50.237 --> 01:56:52.639 region:rollup2
I THINK BE OTHER PERSPECTIVE I

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:54.407 region:rollup2
WANT TO PROVIDE THIS MORNING IS

01:56:52.639 --> 01:56:57.177 region:rollup2
FROM THE CHAU.

01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:58.812 region:rollup2
THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ARE

01:56:57.177 --> 01:57:00.747 region:rollup2
OCCURRING WITH THE FOUR CORE ARE

01:56:58.812 --> 01:57:02.282 region:rollup2
MAKING GREAT PROGRESS WHEN I

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:04.985 region:rollup2
TALK TO MY PEERS OUT THERE.

01:57:02.282 --> 01:57:06.753 region:rollup2
CIO'S ACROSS STATE DEPARTMENTS

01:57:04.985 --> 01:57:08.021 region:rollup2
OR TAKING SECURITY SERIOUSLY.

01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:09.823 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON IT

01:57:08.021 --> 01:57:10.357 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD TRYING

01:57:09.823 --> 01:57:11.892 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE

01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:12.826 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:14.728 region:rollup2
IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING WHEN

01:57:12.826 --> 01:57:16.730 region:rollup2
CIO'S HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO SAY

01:57:14.728 --> 01:57:18.565 region:rollup2
HEY YOU HAVE TO BE CP LAST YEAR

01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:19.466 region:rollup2
ON CYBERSECURITY. WHAT DID YOU

01:57:18.565 --> 01:57:21.001 region:rollup2
DO BECAUSE I NEED TO DO

01:57:19.466 --> 01:57:22.068 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SIMILAR?

01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:22.836 region:rollup2
WERE REALLY SHARING THOSE

01:57:22.068 --> 01:57:24.538 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED IN MAKING

01:57:22.836 --> 01:57:25.805 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

01:57:24.538 --> 01:57:27.908 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THE OTHER OTHER

01:57:25.805 --> 01:57:28.808 region:rollup2
INTERESTING THING IS THAT I KNOW

01:57:27.908 --> 01:57:30.043 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN THE MILITARY

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:31.578 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT STARTED INDEPENDENT

01:57:30.043 --> 01:57:32.846 region:rollup2
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS I IT I

01:57:31.578 --> 01:57:34.881 region:rollup2
CAN'T SAY THAT EVERYBODY WAS

01:57:32.846 --> 01:57:35.482 region:rollup2
OPENED ARMS AND EXCITED ABOUT

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:36.683 region:rollup2
SOMEONE COMING IN AND DOING AN

01:57:35.482 --> 01:57:38.184 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT.

01:57:36.683 --> 01:57:40.420 region:rollup2
BUT BUT I'VE USED AN ANALOGY

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:41.021 region:rollup2
WITH CIO'S THAT THEY SEEM TO

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.355 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE ADOPTED AND BASED

01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:43.723 region:rollup2
ON%

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:45.659 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY'S EXPERIENCE THEY

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:46.927 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE. AYE I WAS DRIVING

01:57:45.659 --> 01:57:48.628 region:rollup2
INTO WORK ONE DAY AND LOOK OVER

01:57:46.927 --> 01:57:50.764 region:rollup2
AND I SAW A BIG RIG WITH A.

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:51.765 region:rollup2
GAS CAP.

01:57:50.764 --> 01:57:53.500 region:rollup2
NO IT'S NOT A HIGHWAY PATROL

01:57:51.765 --> 01:57:54.568 region:rollup2
THING LOOKING GAS CAPS ON ON

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:56.336 region:rollup2
FUEL TANKS BUT THE REASON THAT

01:57:54.568 --> 01:57:57.103 region:rollup2
IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS IT

01:57:56.336 --> 01:57:59.339 region:rollup2
WAS A LOCKING GAS CAP.

01:57:57.103 --> 01:58:00.640 region:rollup2
HE WASN'T.

01:57:59.339 --> 01:58:01.675 region:rollup2
SO WE HAD A TRUCKING COMPANY

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.043 region:rollup2
THAT NEW THE THREAT OF A FUEL

01:58:01.675 --> 01:58:05.645 region:rollup2
THEFT.

01:58:03.043 --> 01:58:06.279 region:rollup2
HAD PAID FOR A LOCKING GAS CAP

01:58:05.645 --> 01:58:07.347 region:rollup2
BUT SOMEONE HAD LEFT THE KEY IN

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:08.815 region:rollup2
THE CASKET.

01:58:07.347 --> 01:58:10.116 region:rollup2
AND I BET IF I ASK THE OWNER

NO. WE NEED FIX THAT.

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:15.989 region:rollup2

IT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE LIKE

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:20.493 region:rollup2
IT'S A HOME.

02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:21.294 region:rollup2
AND TO.

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:22.695 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE HAS A

02:03:21.294 --> 02:03:24.030 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:24.430 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A

02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:27.133 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:28.835 region:rollup2
FOR COMMANDER TRASH.

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:30.436 region:rollup2
IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU DISCUSSED

02:03:28.835 --> 02:03:33.072 region:rollup2
THE SUCCESS THE DEPARTMENTS HAD

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:34.974 region:rollup2
IN ELIMINATING THE KASPERSKY.

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:36.776 region:rollup2
ANTIVIRUS PRODUCTS FROM STATE

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:38.278 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS AND I WONDERED ABOUT

02:03:36.776 --> 02:03:40.046 region:rollup2
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT

02:03:38.278 --> 02:03:41.714 region:rollup2
YOU FOLLOWED AND IDENTIFYING

02:03:40.046 --> 02:03:42.348 region:rollup2
THAT AS A THREAT DID YOU MAKE

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:43.750 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT OR DID YOU

02:03:42.348 --> 02:03:44.851 region:rollup2
RELY ON. THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:45.418 region:rollup2
HOMELAND SECURITY AND

02:03:44.851 --> 02:03:47.487 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THAT PARTICULAR

02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:49.055 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

02:03:47.487 --> 02:03:51.190 region:rollup2
A VERY GOOD QUESTION I'M IT WAS.

02:03:49.055 --> 02:03:53.960 region:rollup2
A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING BECAUSE

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:57.430 region:rollup2
ONCE WE SAW WE NOW UNDERSTAND WE

02:03:53.960 --> 02:04:01.167 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED. DATA

02:03:57.430 --> 02:04:02.735 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE HAD BEEN SEEN WAS OF

02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:04.404 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TALKING AROUND THE

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:06.105 region:rollup2
SUBJECT IN SAYING IT IT LOOKS

02:04:04.404 --> 02:04:08.608 region:rollup2
BAD AND AND THAT KIND OF THING.

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:09.175 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE FINALLY SAW WHAT WHAT

02:04:08.608 --> 02:04:10.710 region:rollup2
WOULD THE PIVOT POINT WAS IS

02:04:09.175 --> 02:04:13.713 region:rollup2
GSA.

02:04:10.710 --> 02:04:15.748 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GSA HAD OF HAD A A.

02:04:13.713 --> 02:04:17.717 region:rollup2
PRESS CONFERENCE.

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:19.819 region:rollup2
TO TO SAY THEY'RE TAKING BECAUSE

02:04:17.717 --> 02:04:21.621 region:rollup2
PERSKY OFF OF THEIR LIST AND

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:23.356 region:rollup2
THAT RAISE RED FLAGS WITH US SO

02:04:21.621 --> 02:04:26.025 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT. ME MY MY ANALYSTS

02:04:23.356 --> 02:04:28.061 region:rollup2
LIKE WE STARTED TALKING TO D. H.

02:04:26.025 --> 02:04:30.129 region:rollup2
US AND I'D THE DOD WE HAD.

02:04:28.061 --> 02:04:31.798 region:rollup2
WHO CAN CALL PARSONS OF HIS

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:34.100 region:rollup2
FOLKS CHECK ON THE DOD SIDE HAD

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:34.600 region:rollup2
YOU WE HAVE HIGH CIDER

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.637 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.505 region:rollup2
THAT IS IS MORE YOU KNOW IT IS

02:04:37.637 --> 02:04:40.606 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MORE PINPOINTED AND IN

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:42.608 region:rollup2
FACT THERE WAS.

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:44.610 region:rollup2
WE WERE ABLE TO TALK THROUGH

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:45.912 region:rollup2
THAT WITH DHS AND GET ENOUGH

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:48.214 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:04:45.912 --> 02:04:50.416 region:rollup2
DOWN AT THE FORUM FOR OF A OF A

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:53.419 region:rollup2
FISH USE ONLY LEVEL TO ACTUALLY

02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:56.422 region:rollup2
SAY THERE WAS SOME SPECIFIC AND

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:58.257 region:rollup2
REAL THREATS THERE. SO WITH THAT

02:04:56.422 --> 02:05:00.159 region:rollup2
I TOOK THAT TO MY DIRECTOR

02:04:58.257 --> 02:05:01.394 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT.

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.628 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT I FELT IT WAS AN

02:05:01.394 --> 02:05:04.964 region:rollup2
IMMINENT THREAT BASED ON THE

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:06.699 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE HAD AND I ASK

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:07.467 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR TONG AND DIRECTOR

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:09.102 region:rollup2
GALLUCCI.

02:05:07.467 --> 02:05:10.570 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT BUT

02:05:09.102 --> 02:05:13.039 region:rollup2
ONCE WE ALL TALK ABOUT IT OF OF

02:05:10.570 --> 02:05:14.674 region:rollup2
THE COLLECTIVE YES WE NEED TO

02:05:13.039 --> 02:05:17.310 region:rollup2
RESIST TO A HIGHER LEVEL.

02:05:14.674 --> 02:05:18.811 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE. OTHER.

02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:20.546 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:22.448 region:rollup2
ARE MADE BY COMPANIES WITH TIES

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:23.983 region:rollup2
TO RUSSIA.

02:05:22.448 --> 02:05:25.785 region:rollup2
THE FOR EXAMPLE A VIRTUAL

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:27.420 region:rollup2
PRIVATE NETWORK SOFTWARE BUT YOU

02:05:25.785 --> 02:05:28.988 region:rollup2
HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT

02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:29.188 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF PRODUCTS.

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:30.757 region:rollup2
WE DO.

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:32.058 region:rollup2
.

02:05:30.757 --> 02:05:33.826 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE CHALLENGE WE FACE

02:05:32.058 --> 02:05:36.796 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS WE DON'T HAVE

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:39.165 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT

02:05:36.796 --> 02:05:40.600 region:rollup2
THEY HAD AS KASPERSKY DEAD AND

02:05:39.165 --> 02:05:43.236 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:44.370 region:rollup2
DAILY AND I MEAN DALY. AYE WE

02:05:43.236 --> 02:05:46.372 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR THAT WE ARE A

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:47.874 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY LOOKING AT THE

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:48.808 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED REPORTS

02:05:47.874 --> 02:05:50.143 region:rollup2
AND TALKING TO OUR FEDERAL

02:05:48.808 --> 02:05:53.012 region:rollup2
COUNTERPARTS.

02:05:50.143 --> 02:05:54.580 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT ONCE IF WHEN

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:57.550 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIFIC THAT

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:58.151 region:rollup2
WE ACT ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

02:05:57.550 --> 02:05:59.118 region:rollup2
ANOTHER QUESTION FOR MISTER

02:05:58.151 --> 02:06:00.553 region:rollup2
HOWLAND.

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:02.522 region:rollup2
IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU WERE

02:06:00.553 --> 02:06:03.523 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT MOST OF

02:06:02.522 --> 02:06:04.757 region:rollup2
THE METRICS ARE TRAINING IN A

02:06:03.523 --> 02:06:06.592 region:rollup2
POSITIVE DIRECTION EXCEPT THOSE

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:07.360 region:rollup2
FOR FISHING ALTHOUGH. I FISHING

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:09.495 region:rollup2
ATTACKS.

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:11.397 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL FISHING TAX ARE UP

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:13.166 region:rollup2
THEY ARE UP TO THE EXTENT THAT.

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.1000 region:rollup2
OVERALL PHISHING ATTACKS ARE

02:06:13.166 --> 02:06:14.767 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF GOOD NEWS

02:06:13.1000 --> 02:06:16.102 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:18.204 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I REQUEST ABOUT THE

02:06:16.102 --> 02:06:19.138 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING ON

02:06:18.204 --> 02:06:20.473 region:rollup2
THAT METRIC BECAUSE.

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:21.741 region:rollup2
BY DEFINITION IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:06:20.473 --> 02:06:23.309 region:rollup2
AT A FISHING ATTACK YOU ONLY

02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:25.711 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT IT IF SOMEONE.

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:27.914 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZES IT AS AN

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:29.882 region:rollup2
ATTACK YOU KNOW BY DEFINITE WIN

02:06:27.914 --> 02:06:31.317 region:rollup2
OR THEY'RE UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:32.685 region:rollup2
ATTACK RESULTS IN AN INFECTION

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:34.087 region:rollup2
THAN LEADER YOU CAN.

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:35.788 region:rollup2
I DO A POSTMORTEM AND DETERMINE

02:06:34.087 --> 02:06:37.857 region:rollup2
THAT THE INFECTION WAS A RESULT

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:39.625 region:rollup2
OF THE FISHING EMAIL. A BUT

02:06:37.857 --> 02:06:40.927 region:rollup2
OTHER IS NOT A NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:41.828 region:rollup2
THE METHODOLOGY IS YOU KNOW

02:06:40.927 --> 02:06:43.196 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT A LARGE

02:06:41.828 --> 02:06:45.198 region:rollup2
CATEGORY OF USERS THAT DIDN'T

02:06:43.196 --> 02:06:46.632 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNIZES A TAXI

02:06:45.198 --> 02:06:48.534 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE. AND

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:49.302 region:rollup2
THEN SECOND OF ALL SOME OF THE

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:51.170 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS

02:06:49.302 --> 02:06:52.605 region:rollup2
WILL BE AFTER THINGS LIKE THAT

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.873 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T DETECT LATER LOOK FOR

02:06:52.605 --> 02:06:55.508 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE LAST PERSONAL

02:06:53.873 --> 02:06:56.976 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OR PASSWORDS OR

02:06:55.508 --> 02:06:58.377 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT DON'T

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:59.412 region:rollup2
RESULT IN AN INFECTION THAT THAT

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:00.947 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TRACE BACK TO THE EMAIL

02:06:59.412 --> 02:07:02.815 region:rollup2
SO I WONDER HOW YOU HAVE

02:07:00.947 --> 02:07:03.616 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN THE IN THOSE

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:06.486 region:rollup2
METRICS WHEN THOSE.

02:07:03.616 --> 02:07:07.320 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMS ARE ARE EXTENT

02:07:06.486 --> 02:07:08.588 region:rollup2
SO THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.555 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN YOU'RE CORRECT ON THAT

02:07:08.588 --> 02:07:11.023 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY.

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:12.425 region:rollup2
THOSE METRICS ARE BASED ON CAL

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:14.327 region:rollup2
CAESAR'S REPORTS ACTUALLY

02:07:12.425 --> 02:07:16.128 region:rollup2
REPORTED EVENTS AND SO WHENWE

02:07:14.327 --> 02:07:18.331 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF REPORTED

02:07:16.128 --> 02:07:19.866 region:rollup2
FISHING EVENTS. UP AND THEN WE

02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:21.834 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF.

02:07:19.866 --> 02:07:23.870 region:rollup2
MALL WHERE INFECTIONS THAT WERE

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:25.972 region:rollup2
RELATED TO PHISHING ATTACKS AS

02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:27.740 region:rollup2
FAR AS THOSE NUMBERS SO DID WE

02:07:25.972 --> 02:07:29.742 region:rollup2
CAPTURE HUNDRED PERCENT. NO

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:31.177 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT I THINK WHEN

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:32.378 region:rollup2
IT'S THE REALLY THAT MALL WHERE

02:07:31.177 --> 02:07:34.146 region:rollup2
INFECTION IS PROBABLY THE MOST

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:35.948 region:rollup2
ACCURATE ONE. BECAUSE WHEN

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:36.115 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN AND THERE

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:38.150 region:rollup2
IS.

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:39.986 region:rollup2
CAO CAESAR'S REPORT AND WE DO

02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:41.754 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE WE WERE LOOKING AT

02:07:39.986 --> 02:07:42.855 region:rollup2
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE

02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:44.357 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND FISH

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:45.358 region:rollup2
ITSELF OKAY WELL THE REASON I'M

02:07:44.357 --> 02:07:48.628 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IS BECAUSE I THINK

02:07:45.358 --> 02:07:49.996 region:rollup2
THE. INFECTION IS THE EASIEST.

02:07:48.628 --> 02:07:52.465 region:rollup2
THING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN

02:07:49.996 --> 02:07:52.965 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO MALWARE BECAUSE I'M

02:07:52.465 --> 02:07:53.966 region:rollup2
SORRY A PHISHING ATTACKS

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:55.701 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:57.737 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAD AN ENTERPRISE

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:59.038 region:rollup2
LEVEL CAN INFLUENCE THE ABILITY

02:07:57.737 --> 02:08:00.339 region:rollup2
OF THE USER TO DO THINGS THAT

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:01.607 region:rollup2
AFFECT THE SYSTEM BUT.

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:02.875 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE OTHER TYPES OF

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:04.877 region:rollup2
PHISHING ATTACKS WE REALLY HAVE

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:06.279 region:rollup2
A LOT LESS CONTROL OVER AND IF

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:07.280 region:rollup2
THE USER IS GOING TO. PUT.

02:08:06.279 --> 02:08:08.514 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE A

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.782 region:rollup2
PASSWORD.

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:11.817 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THROUGH THE IN

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:13.452 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO FISHING ATTACK IN A

02:08:11.817 --> 02:08:14.554 region:rollup2
WEEK WE HAVE A LOT LESS.

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:16.455 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE OVER THAT THE ONLY

02:08:14.554 --> 02:08:17.757 region:rollup2
THING WE CAN DO IS EDUCATE SO I

02:08:16.455 --> 02:08:19.125 region:rollup2
THINK THOSE ARE MORE A LOT MORE

02:08:17.757 --> 02:08:20.393 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC TO DEAL WITH OH OH

02:08:19.125 --> 02:08:22.061 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY IN YOU WHEN WE LOOK

02:08:20.393 --> 02:08:22.929 region:rollup2
AT OUR INCIDENTS WE WE HAD A

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:24.297 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF INCIDENTS THEY

02:08:22.929 --> 02:08:26.199 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AN INFECTION ON. A

02:08:24.297 --> 02:08:27.433 region:rollup2
DESKTOP IT UNFORTUNATELY SOME

02:08:26.199 --> 02:08:29.435 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GAVE UP CREDENTIALS AND

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:30.002 region:rollup2
THEN YOU HAVE ME MUCH MAILBOXES

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:31.737 region:rollup2
TAKEN OVER AND THEN YOU'RE

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:32.838 region:rollup2
CHASING THAT. IT BECOMES A MUCH

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:34.907 region:rollup2
BIGGER INCIDENT SO YOU'RE

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:37.109 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON YOU KNOW IF

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:38.911 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET USERS. TO NOT DO THAT

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:40.580 region:rollup2
CLICK I CALL MY* IF WE GET

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:41.747 region:rollup2
THE THE CLICKERS NOT TO CLICK

02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:43.716 region:rollup2
AND FOLKS NOT TO PROVIDE

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:45.318 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS IT PIT STOPS IT

02:08:43.716 --> 02:08:46.719 region:rollup2
THERE BUT AS WE TALKED EARLIER

02:08:45.318 --> 02:08:48.554 region:rollup2
IT'S. HOW DO WE COMBINE

02:08:46.719 --> 02:08:49.622 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO STOP IT STOP IT

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:51.224 region:rollup2
FROM GETTING TO THE USER IN THE

02:08:49.622 --> 02:08:54.594 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE BUT MAKES OUR USERS

02:08:51.224 --> 02:08:55.661 region:rollup2
ARE WELL EDUCATED BECAUSE?

02:08:54.594 --> 02:08:57.096 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO GO ON

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:58.764 region:rollup2
A PERCENT OF A. AND TO MAKE SURE

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:59.799 region:rollup2
WE'RE REALLY SMART AND IT'S

02:08:58.764 --> 02:09:02.969 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT

02:08:59.799 --> 02:09:04.003 region:rollup2
JUST THAT THE VOLUME OF EMAILS

02:09:02.969 --> 02:09:04.637 region:rollup2
WE ALL GET.

02:09:04.003 --> 02:09:05.271 region:rollup2
WE WE CRANK THEIR EMAILS WERE

02:09:04.637 --> 02:09:05.905 region:rollup2
JUST TRYING TO GET IT DONE AND

02:09:05.271 --> 02:09:08.207 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ALL TAKE

02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:09.642 region:rollup2
THE TIME WE NEED TO VERIFY THAT.

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:10.610 region:rollup2
THAT REQUEST THE CLICK ON A LINK

02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:12.345 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REQUEST FOR A

02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:13.312 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

02:09:12.345 --> 02:09:15.581 region:rollup2
WHERE WE GET INTO THE BIGGEST

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:17.049 region:rollup2
TROUBLE IS LEGITIMATE?

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:19.418 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES WE'RE JUST ON

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:21.520 region:rollup2
AUTOPILOT AND BOOM WE GO IN AND

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:22.121 region:rollup2
BAD THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN IT'S

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:23.456 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE AN INSTANT TO DEAL

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:24.790 region:rollup2
WITH PER.

02:09:23.456 --> 02:09:26.425 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND IF I MAY I

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:26.826 region:rollup2
I JUST DON'T WANT ADDITIONAL A

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:28.127 region:rollup2
COMPONENT TO THAT.

02:09:26.826 --> 02:09:29.829 region:rollup2
.

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:31.230 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS ALSO WHY WE LAYERED

02:09:29.829 --> 02:09:32.898 region:rollup2
DEFENSES AND DETECTION.

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:34.600 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:36.335 region:rollup2
NEO FISHING EMAILS.

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:37.503 region:rollup2
.

02:09:36.335 --> 02:09:39.872 region:rollup2
STUFF GETS THROUGH.

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:41.707 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY WERE I DO INTERNAL

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:43.075 region:rollup2
STANDS DOING THAT LARRY TEXAN

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.176 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY WITHIN THE STATE YOU

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:45.444 region:rollup2
PUT THROUGH SOCK.

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:46.946 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS.

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:49.048 region:rollup2
HAVE DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES

02:09:46.946 --> 02:09:49.582 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO TO MONITOR ON

02:09:49.048 --> 02:09:50.216 region:rollup2
NETWORKS IN LAW HAVE LONG

02:09:49.582 --> 02:09:50.816 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

02:09:50.216 --> 02:09:52.251 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:53.653 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A CREDENTIAL THEFT

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:54.487 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY RESULT

02:09:53.653 --> 02:09:56.022 region:rollup2
AND FACTION.

02:09:54.487 --> 02:09:57.256 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA SEE HOPEFULLY THE

02:09:56.022 --> 02:09:58.157 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY RESULTING FROM THAT

02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:59.392 region:rollup2
MISUSE OF CREDENTIALS AND THINGS

02:09:58.157 --> 02:10:01.093 region:rollup2
ALONG THOSE LINES

02:09:59.392 --> 02:10:03.262 region:rollup2
SO BY LAYERING THOSE DEFENSES

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:04.263 region:rollup2
YOUR DISK IN REDUCING THE RISK

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:05.498 region:rollup2
AT LEAST SO IF SOMEONE DOES

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.999 region:rollup2
PROVIDE INFORMATION.

02:10:05.498 --> 02:10:07.933 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.201 region:rollup2
GOING ON.

02:10:07.933 --> 02:10:09.902 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I THINK.

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:11.704 region:rollup2
FIREEYE PUBLISHED.

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:13.839 region:rollup2
STATISTICALLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO

02:10:11.704 --> 02:10:14.373 region:rollup2
THURMOND DID REPORT THAT I'M OUT

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:15.775 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE BREACHES THEY

02:10:14.373 --> 02:10:17.810 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED. WAS ALMOST A

02:10:15.775 --> 02:10:19.178 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEM HAD.

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:20.179 region:rollup2
UP TODAY ANTI VIRUS.

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:21.514 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE

02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:23.015 region:rollup2
BRIDGES ARE FROM CREDENTIAL

02:10:21.514 --> 02:10:23.315 region:rollup2
THEFT AND THINGS ALONG THOSE

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.351 region:rollup2
LINES SO.

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:26.652 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING THAT ARE TEXAS

02:10:25.351 --> 02:10:28.554 region:rollup2
STRATEGY IS IS PROVIDING THAT

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:30.189 region:rollup2
ARE LEAST ALLOWING US DETECT OUT

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:32.358 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND RESPOND TO.

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:33.359 region:rollup2

THEY CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:24.877 region:rollup2
WEBSITE DEFACE HURTS A LOT OF

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:27.179 region:rollup2
TIMES WILL ACTUALLY GET

02:11:24.877 --> 02:11:28.247 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OF A WEBSITE DEFACE

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:30.483 region:rollup2
MEN IN THE REASON WHY SOME OF

02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:31.584 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS ON NOBODY IS BECAUSE

02:11:30.483 --> 02:11:33.085 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE FRONT PAGE.

02:11:31.584 --> 02:11:34.453 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE OF THEIR BACK PAGES OR

02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:36.355 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE SECONDARY OUR THIRD

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:37.890 region:rollup2
PAGES SO GET THIS INFORMATION

SELL WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT. AND

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:44.597 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE GOING TO FIND IT BUT

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:45.765 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF LARGE

02:11:44.597 --> 02:11:48.100 region:rollup2
CITIES IN THIS ONE IS A LITTLE

02:11:45.765 --> 02:11:49.201 region:rollup2
SCARY BUT WE GOT A COUPLE LARGE

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:50.803 region:rollup2
CITIES THAT.

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:51.637 region:rollup2
THEY HAVEN'T BOUGHT INTO THE

02:11:50.803 --> 02:11:53.072 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:54.807 region:rollup2
GET MY HEAD OF SAND.

02:11:53.072 --> 02:11:55.508 region:rollup2

02:11:54.807 --> 02:11:58.444 region:rollup2
CITY IN THE.

02:11:55.508 --> 02:12:00.813 region:rollup2
SUCH CALIFORNIA THAT HAS HAD

02:11:58.444 --> 02:12:01.881 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH FISHING AND MALWARE

02:12:00.813 --> 02:12:03.249 region:rollup2
ATTACKS

02:12:01.881 --> 02:12:04.717 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE COULD ACTUALLY

02:12:03.249 --> 02:12:07.119 region:rollup2
CALLED US AND SAID HEY.

02:12:04.717 --> 02:12:08.187 region:rollup2
A CAN YOU LOOK AT THIS STRING

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:08.888 region:rollup2
FORCE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT AND

02:12:08.187 --> 02:12:10.723 region:rollup2
WE'VE SAID.

02:12:08.888 --> 02:12:13.225 region:rollup2
YET THAT'S FROM CHINA.

02:12:10.723 --> 02:12:15.094 region:rollup2
SO SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT I

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:16.462 region:rollup2
AM WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD WE SPENT A

02:12:15.094 --> 02:12:18.197 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME IN THE EDUCATION

02:12:16.462 --> 02:12:19.465 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

02:12:18.197 --> 02:12:21.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE RESEARCH

02:12:19.465 --> 02:12:22.868 region:rollup2
COMPONENT AND YOU KNOW THEIR

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.103 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE MUCH MORE OPEN

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:25.938 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM TO BE

02:12:24.103 --> 02:12:27.540 region:rollup2
OPEN TO TO DO RESEARCH SO WE

02:12:25.938 --> 02:12:29.542 region:rollup2
SPENT A LOT OF TIME I I'M INTO

02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:30.843 region:rollup2
THE TERM BOTNET ACTIVITY. SO

02:12:29.542 --> 02:12:32.545 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS S A LOT OF THE

02:12:30.843 --> 02:12:35.314 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS THAT ARE ON THEIR

02:12:32.545 --> 02:12:37.716 region:rollup2
NETWORKS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER.

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:39.919 region:rollup2
AND THEN ARE BEING USED AS KIND

02:12:37.716 --> 02:12:41.587 region:rollup2
OF A CHAIN TO DO OTHER TYPE OF

02:12:39.919 --> 02:12:44.423 region:rollup2
NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY SO WE SPENT A

02:12:41.587 --> 02:12:46.525 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME. A COLON UP YEAH I

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:48.561 region:rollup2
SEE ISSUE EDU A AND ET USED

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:49.161 region:rollup2
CATER TWELVE. AND SAY HEY YOU

02:12:48.561 --> 02:12:51.363 region:rollup2
GOT SOME.

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:53.866 region:rollup2
THESE COMPUTERS THAT ARE AYE

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:55.201 region:rollup2
INFECTED AND THEY GO BACK IN THE

02:12:53.866 --> 02:12:57.570 region:rollup2
OLD YEP AND THEY HAVE A FIX OF.

02:12:55.201 --> 02:12:59.772 region:rollup2
SO IT RANGES AND AND THINGS.

02:12:57.570 --> 02:13:01.340 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE DO YOU KNOW I WANT TO

02:12:59.772 --> 02:13:01.807 region:rollup2
TAKE ALL AND NOT HIGHLIGHT

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.310 region:rollup2
FISHING.

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:08.747 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THIS.

02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:09.748 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A A VERY YOU KNOW.

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.382 region:rollup2
THE FIERY ALSO WHEN THERE'S BEEN

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:12.451 region:rollup2
A COUPLE REPORTS IT SAID

02:13:10.382 --> 02:13:14.653 region:rollup2
PHISHING. ATTACKS TRENDS FOR

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:16.822 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:18.657 region:rollup2
TO TO GET LARGER. AND IT'S

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:19.592 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RULES OF

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:21.260 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENTS OUTSIDE SOMEONE

02:13:19.592 --> 02:13:22.828 region:rollup2
MENTION WHAT KIND OF ACTORS I

02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.797 region:rollup2
THINK WAS YOU ON.

02:13:22.828 --> 02:13:25.498 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE CHAU ABOUT WHAT KIND

02:13:24.797 --> 02:13:27.466 region:rollup2
OF ACTORS.

02:13:25.498 --> 02:13:29.869 region:rollup2
IN OUR NATION STATES NATION

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:31.470 region:rollup2
STATES THAT YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE

02:13:29.869 --> 02:13:32.304 region:rollup2
OF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WE DO

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:34.473 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T.

02:13:32.304 --> 02:13:36.675 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:38.544 region:rollup2
CAUGHT OR IF THERE ARE NO

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:40.346 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES WHY STOP.

02:13:38.544 --> 02:13:41.814 region:rollup2
SO THE POINT IS IN AND WITH THE

02:13:40.346 --> 02:13:43.549 region:rollup2
LAYERED APPROACH WITH THE TEAM

02:13:41.814 --> 02:13:44.149 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT'S WHY IT'S SO

02:13:43.549 --> 02:13:45.918 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEE STUFF

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:47.253 region:rollup2
AT.

02:13:45.918 --> 02:13:48.787 region:rollup2
STATE LEVEL AND SEEING AND STATE

02:13:47.253 --> 02:13:51.023 region:rollup2
ENTITIES OR IF I SEE IT IN THE

02:13:48.787 --> 02:13:52.958 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OR THE BANKING SECTOR.

02:13:51.023 --> 02:13:54.793 region:rollup2
TO PASS THAT INFORMATION OVER TO

02:13:52.958 --> 02:13:56.562 region:rollup2
PETER AND HIS FOLKS SO THAT WE

02:13:54.793 --> 02:13:57.897 region:rollup2
CAN GET THAT LATER APPROACHES

02:13:56.562 --> 02:13:59.331 region:rollup2
START LOOKING MORE ACTIVELY AT

02:13:57.897 --> 02:14:02.067 region:rollup2
THAT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S ALSO

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:03.602 region:rollup2
LARGELY IMPORTANT FOR US.

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:04.970 region:rollup2
TO NOT JUST TAKE THAT THREAT

02:14:03.602 --> 02:14:05.538 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WERE GIVING IT BUT

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:08.207 region:rollup2
THE CORRELATED AND SAY THIS

02:14:05.538 --> 02:14:09.508 region:rollup2
DATA.

02:14:08.207 --> 02:14:11.210 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT LOOKS AT EDUCATION

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:14.113 region:rollup2
SECTOR AND THEN TALK TO THEM

02:14:11.210 --> 02:14:15.447 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SO. I'M A IN

02:14:14.113 --> 02:14:16.982 region:rollup2
ENCLOSING ON THAT PIECE IT IS

02:14:15.447 --> 02:14:18.450 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A GAMUT OF IT I

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:18.984 region:rollup2
WOULD TELL YOU PROBABLY THE

02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:21.720 region:rollup2
BIGGEST.

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:21.987 region:rollup2
AMOUNT IS IS WEBSITE DEFACE

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.322 region:rollup2
MINTS AND.

02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:23.489 region:rollup2

THE.

02:14:23.489 --> 02:14:26.225 region:rollup2
BUTTON AND ACTIVITY SO WOULD IT

02:14:25.324 --> 02:14:28.861 region:rollup2
BE CORRECT TO SAY THAT.

02:14:26.225 --> 02:14:30.462 region:rollup2
DIS IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

02:14:28.861 --> 02:14:31.697 region:rollup2
HAVE NO SAFEGUARDS AGAINST

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:33.832 region:rollup2
CYBERATTACKS WHATSOEVER DO THEY

02:14:31.697 --> 02:14:35.668 region:rollup2
HAVE A LITTLE MINIMAL LEVEL OF

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:37.703 region:rollup2
FUN. YES REGARDS IT AND WHAT YOU

02:14:35.668 --> 02:14:40.039 region:rollup2
NORMALLY FIND SIR IS THAT THESE

02:14:37.703 --> 02:14:41.507 region:rollup2
ARE THE. THE EITHER THE THE

02:14:40.039 --> 02:14:43.442 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS IN THE RESEARCH LAB.

02:14:41.507 --> 02:14:44.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THEIR THEY HAVE

02:14:43.442 --> 02:14:46.545 region:rollup2
LOW WERE.

02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:48.480 region:rollup2
DEFENSES ON THEM THEN THEY

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:49.848 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE ON THAT ON A FACULTY

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:51.550 region:rollup2
MEMBER AND AND ON THE NETWORK ON

02:14:49.848 --> 02:14:52.818 region:rollup2
THEIR IT'S MORE OF THE RESEARCH

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:55.754 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY ONES THAT HAVE A IT'S

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:56.822 region:rollup2
NOT THAT THEY DON'T. THEY JUST

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.856 region:rollup2
HAVE MINIMAL.

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:59.325 region:rollup2
NO THE OBJECTIVE OBVIOUSLY IS TO

02:14:57.856 --> 02:15:00.826 region:rollup2
CAN REACH OUT TO MORE OF THESE

I'M SU IF THAT IS THE CASE IN A

02:15:04.263 --> 02:15:07.433 region:rollup2
WOULD THE DEPARTMENT BE

DOES NOT ONLY NEED TO BE

02:16:19.705 --> 02:16:22.941 region:rollup2
PROCURED THE DEPARTMENT

02:16:21.106 --> 02:16:23.709 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:24.910 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTION INFRASTRUCTURE.

MANAGE MALICIOUS ACTIVITY AS IT

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:34.653 region:rollup2
COMES THROUGH SO THAT IS NOW A

02:16:32.785 --> 02:16:35.220 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE STATE.

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:36.288 region:rollup2

GOT IT NOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:42.694 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL. AGENCIES

02:16:40.993 --> 02:16:44.530 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA USE CALCLOUD SO

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:45.097 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE BREAKDOWN.

02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:47.066 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:16:45.097 --> 02:16:49.301 region:rollup2
LET'S A PERCENTAGE WISE HOW

02:16:47.066 --> 02:16:50.903 region:rollup2
HOMIES AGE STATE AGENCIES ARE

02:16:49.301 --> 02:16:52.271 region:rollup2
USING SOMETHING OTHER THAN CAO

02:16:50.903 --> 02:16:53.372 region:rollup2
CLOUT WELL THERE ARE STILL A

02:16:52.271 --> 02:16:54.907 region:rollup2
NUMBER STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE

02:16:53.372 --> 02:16:55.808 region:rollup2
USING COMMERCIAL CLOUT OUTSIDE

02:16:54.907 --> 02:16:57.643 region:rollup2
OF OUR INTER CONNECTED BODIES

02:16:55.808 --> 02:16:58.343 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SLOWLY BUT SURELY

02:16:57.643 --> 02:16:59.878 region:rollup2
HAVING DIALOGUE WITH THEM.

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:00.846 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT POLICY AND HOW

02:16:59.878 --> 02:17:02.514 region:rollup2
WE WANT EFFECTUATE THE RIGHT

02:17:00.846 --> 02:17:03.782 region:rollup2
TYPES OF CHANGES TO SAY HEY IF

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:05.250 region:rollup2
YOU PURCHASE THE DEPARTMENT

02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:06.652 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW ARE YOU

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:07.886 region:rollup2
GONNA GET COST CONTAINMENT AND

02:17:06.652 --> 02:17:08.821 region:rollup2
STATE BEST VALUE BUT YOU'RE

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:10.722 region:rollup2
GONNA GET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

02:17:08.821 --> 02:17:11.824 region:rollup2
SECURITY POSTURE. THAT WE CAN

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.891 region:rollup2
OFFER NOT ONLY TO OUR SECURITY

02:17:11.824 --> 02:17:14.593 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS CENTER BUT THROUGH

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:15.828 region:rollup2
OUR CORE AND FOR SURE.

02:17:14.593 --> 02:17:16.962 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO AS I MENTIONED

02:17:15.828 --> 02:17:18.864 region:rollup2
EARLIER STARTING HOW DIALOGUE

02:17:16.962 --> 02:17:19.498 region:rollup2
WITH CITY AND COUNTY CIO'S ON

02:17:18.864 --> 02:17:20.766 region:rollup2
HOW THEY CAN LEVERAGE OUR CLOUD

02:17:19.498 --> 02:17:23.068 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:17:20.766 --> 02:17:24.670 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVING OTHER AYE AYE CLOUD

02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:26.271 region:rollup2
AYE OF BEER INVITATION FOR A BIT

02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:27.272 region:rollup2
ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW. AND

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:28.474 region:rollup2
WE'RE ASKING THE COUNTY TO COME

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:29.808 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE WITH US DURING

02:17:28.474 --> 02:17:30.609 region:rollup2
CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:32.511 region:rollup2
VENDORS

02:17:30.609 --> 02:17:34.646 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS I THINK AN ELEMENT

02:17:32.511 --> 02:17:36.348 region:rollup2
OF. SINCERITY WITH THE COUNTY

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:37.716 region:rollup2
SAW CIO'S AS WELL AS THE EYE OF

02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:39.585 region:rollup2
SO COMMUNITIES TO START LOOKING

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:41.053 region:rollup2
OUT OF STANDARDIZING IT PLATFORM

02:17:39.585 --> 02:17:42.287 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:17:41.053 --> 02:17:44.256 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES THE NECESSARY SECURITY

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:45.023 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

02:17:44.256 --> 02:17:46.758 region:rollup2
GOTTA THANK YOU MISTER LIEBER

02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:48.694 region:rollup2
YOU'D DO A CITED SOME NUMBERS.

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:51.930 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SAID THAT THERE'S

02:17:48.694 --> 02:17:52.464 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF.

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:54.633 region:rollup2
THE TAX.

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:56.602 region:rollup2
MADEO THEREABOUTS IN IN OF

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:57.836 region:rollup2
WHICH A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE

02:17:56.602 --> 02:17:59.872 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WERE ARE CONSIDERED TO

02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:01.740 region:rollup2
BE SUSPICIOUS.

02:17:59.872 --> 02:18:03.408 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER.

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:04.243 region:rollup2
THE MAJORITY OF THE THE THE

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:06.712 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS.

02:18:04.243 --> 02:18:08.180 region:rollup2
WERE TARGETING PARTICULAR

02:18:06.712 --> 02:18:09.681 region:rollup2
SECTORS EXAMPLE WHETHER ITS

02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:11.884 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SECTOR.

02:18:09.681 --> 02:18:14.353 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY THE ELECTION SYSTEM

02:18:11.884 --> 02:18:15.888 region:rollup2
OR OTHERWISE ANY ANY ANY DUE TO

02:18:14.353 --> 02:18:18.590 region:rollup2
SEE A TREND AS TO WHAT KIND OF

02:18:15.888 --> 02:18:20.392 region:rollup2
ATTACKS THAT YOU KNOW OF ALL

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:22.294 region:rollup2
THESE ARE. BAD ACTORS ARE.

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:24.196 region:rollup2
DOING FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE YOU

02:18:22.294 --> 02:18:25.230 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT.

02:18:24.196 --> 02:18:26.532 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT.

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:28.200 region:rollup2
SO I I CAN SAY THAT.

02:18:26.532 --> 02:18:30.502 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THAT ARE YOU CAN

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:32.938 region:rollup2
UTILIZING SIEGE AND WE HAVE THE

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:33.105 region:rollup2
THAT STAT APPLIES NAM. A LOT OF

02:18:32.938 --> 02:18:34.540 region:rollup2
THE.

02:18:33.105 --> 02:18:36.575 region:rollup2
.

02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:38.410 region:rollup2
ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN OUR SO.

02:18:36.575 --> 02:18:38.810 region:rollup2
WE GIVE THAT STATISTIC THE TWO

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.512 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION.

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:42.181 region:rollup2
PER DAY AT SUCH A BLOCKED

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:43.849 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS AND SO.

02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:45.417 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE BLOCKED YOU

02:18:43.849 --> 02:18:47.286 region:rollup2
WON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:48.720 region:rollup2
INTENT IS ABOUT THE COMING FROM

02:18:47.286 --> 02:18:49.822 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS SITES TO HAVE THAT

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:51.290 region:rollup2
CERTAIN TYPE TRAFFIC PATTERN

02:18:49.822 --> 02:18:52.491 region:rollup2
THAT IS PROBLEMATIC.

02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:53.759 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T EVEN LET HIM

02:18:52.491 --> 02:18:54.927 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DOOR IF YOU WELL.

02:18:53.759 --> 02:18:57.062 region:rollup2
I'M VERY HARD TO GET.

02:18:54.927 --> 02:18:57.863 region:rollup2
STATISTICS ON THAT BECAUSE WE

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:59.298 region:rollup2
WE BALK AT ITS SOURCE.

02:18:57.863 --> 02:18:59.898 region:rollup2
BOB THE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE

02:18:59.298 --> 02:19:01.200 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:18:59.898 --> 02:19:02.301 region:rollup2
STATISTIC WHICH IS C. A

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.069 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS EVENTS THAT WE'VE

02:19:02.301 --> 02:19:04.903 region:rollup2
ANALYZED.

02:19:04.069 --> 02:19:06.305 region:rollup2
IS THAT'S THE TRAFFIC THAT GETS

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:07.639 region:rollup2
TO THE DOOR BUT STILL LOOKS A

02:19:06.305 --> 02:19:09.074 region:rollup2
LITTLE FUNKY WANNA DO SOME

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:10.075 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:11.376 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS.

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:13.545 region:rollup2
MALICIOUS.

02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:17.482 region:rollup2
SO BASED OFF OF THAT.

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:18.550 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THE THE SPLIT IS.

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:19.985 region:rollup2
AYE I'LL HAVE PARTS OF HIS DICK

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.153 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD

02:19:19.985 --> 02:19:22.754 region:rollup2
WE SEE.

02:19:21.153 --> 02:19:24.289 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPLOITS

02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:25.591 region:rollup2
BEEN ATTEMPTED WE'VE SEEN.

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:26.925 region:rollup2
.

02:19:25.591 --> 02:19:28.627 region:rollup2
SOME KNOWN PAST KNOWN.

02:19:26.925 --> 02:19:29.795 region:rollup2
EXPLOITS YOU SEE THINGS LIKE

02:19:28.627 --> 02:19:30.629 region:rollup2
HEART BELIEVE BEING ATTEMPTED.

02:19:29.795 --> 02:19:32.264 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:33.332 region:rollup2
AN OLD VULNERABILITY.

02:19:32.264 --> 02:19:34.399 region:rollup2
.

02:19:33.332 --> 02:19:36.034 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY ACROSS THE

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:37.636 region:rollup2
BOARD AND THE REASON FOR THAT MY

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:39.838 region:rollup2
OPINION IS THAT MAJORITY OF THIS

02:19:37.636 --> 02:19:41.206 region:rollup2
IS AUTOMATED.

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:43.575 region:rollup2
ON ITS

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:45.143 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SCRIPTS BEING RUN BY.

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:46.278 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOLKS OUT THERE AND

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:47.446 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:19:46.278 --> 02:19:48.981 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE U. S..

02:19:47.446 --> 02:19:50.382 region:rollup2
WITH MALICIOUS INTENT.

02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:51.383 region:rollup2
BETTER JUST HAMMERING AWAY WITH

02:19:50.382 --> 02:19:52.651 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY CAN IF THEY GET A

02:19:51.383 --> 02:19:54.086 region:rollup2
INDICATOR BACK THAT IT'S

02:19:52.651 --> 02:19:54.686 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT CAN BREAK INTO.

02:19:54.086 --> 02:19:55.520 region:rollup2
WILL FLIP A SWITCH AND GO FOR

02:19:54.686 --> 02:19:56.688 region:rollup2
IT.

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:57.889 region:rollup2
.

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:59.491 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OTHER ARE SOME

02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.559 region:rollup2
TARGETED ATTACKS.

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:01.827 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE.

02:20:00.559 --> 02:20:03.262 region:rollup2
SPLIT ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY

02:20:01.827 --> 02:20:04.897 region:rollup2
