THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS AT A FOURTEEN RESOLUTION THE ASSN VOTERS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE ALL WORKERS WHO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES AT THE UC. ARE FOR THE SAME EQUAL OP EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS AS YOU SEE EMPLOYEES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SECOND. I WITNESSES HURTING A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION [inaudible] MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHERINE LIVE ORDER PRESIDENT OF APPS ME THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE THE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT AN ACA FOURTEEN OR CLEANING TOILETS BED PANS. PICKING UP TRASH THE COOKING THE FOOD MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS SUPPORTING THE DOCTORS NURSES FACULTY AND STUDENTS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS ON THE ISSUE OF MONEY. FIRST OF THE ACA APPLIES AT THE EXPIRATION OR RENEWAL OF EXISTING CONTRACTS WHICH CURRENTLY ALL HAVE VARYING IN TERMS RANGING FROM THREE TO TEN YEARS. AS A RESULT THERE IS A BUILT IN PHASE IN PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS. SECONDS NOTHING IN THE ACA REQUIRES THE USE YOU TO HIRE THE SAME NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OR ANY SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL WORKER. THIRD WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EXCEPTIONS FOR EMERGENCY NEEDS. A BROAD EXEMPTION FOR PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES IS DRAFTED BROADLY ENOUGH TO PROVIDE YOU SEE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS ANY ADDITIONAL SHORT TERM TEMPORARY STAFFING NEEDS. INCLUDING IN THE MEDICAL CENTERS. FINALLY THE STATE AUDITOR REVIEWED YOU SEE PRESIDENT'S ASSERTION THAT THE UC SYSTEM WIDE PROCUREMENT PROGRAM IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN HAD PRODUCED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROCUREMENT BENEFITS. A TERM USED TO REFER TO COST REDUCTIONS OR AVOIDANCE INCENTIVES OR REVENUE HOWEVER THE STATE AUDITOR FOUNDER THAT UC LACKED ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO SUBSTANTIATE NINE OF THE TEN ESTIMATE ESTIMATED BENEFITS REVIEWED. BECAUSE NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE POWER TO ENSURE SUPPORT SERVICES WORKERS ARE TREATED EQUALLY I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER PLACING THIS ON THE BALLOT FOR YOUR VOTERS TO DECIDE THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS UP THANK YOU MY NAME IS CLAIRE PER PROGRAM HERE JUST TO ANSWER ANY POTENTIAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THOSE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER ORGANIZATION. THEY GIVE US SURE MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. AND DR ROBERT WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ANYONE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA -- WE HEAR TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO A CA -- FOURTEEN TO STICK TO THE FISCAL MATTERS I WOULD POINT OUT THE UNIVERSITIES FISCAL ESTIMATE IS A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF THE PROHIBITIONS ON CONTRACTING OUT CONTAINED. IN A CA. FOURTEEN THIS -- THIS IS SOME IS MADE UP PRIMARILY OF THE BOTH WAGE AND BENEFIT PREMIUMS WE BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY OR COVER IN ORDER BRING ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY CONTACT STAFF. IN HOUSE I KNOW THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT -- SOME THIS WORK BE TAKEN ON BY EXISTING EMPLOYEES BUT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT -- HE'LL BOTH OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND JUST GENERAL PRACTICES. TYPICALLY PRECLUDE YOU FROM JUST HEAPING MORTICIAN WORK ON TOP OF THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY. WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY SO WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SAVINGS TO BE FOUND THERE AT ALL. IN ADDITION TO THE WAGE PREMIUMS A BENEFIT PREVIEWS I'VE DISCUSSED WE DO ALSO EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT THAT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO TO PROCURE IN AND BRING IN HOUSES RESULT OF THIS WE DO PCA CONTRACT OUT IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE A NEED FOR SPECIALIZED. EQUIPMENT AND SO FORTH WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORIAL STAFF TO SUPERVISE THESE NEW EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT ON BOARD. PURSUANT TO THE BILL AS WELL AS HAVE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH AND CLINICAL SIDE WHEREBY WE WOULD HAVE REVENUE LOSSES IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. AS A RESULT OF HAVING -- TO THE FOR THE FOR OR REMOVE PATIENTS MOVE THE MONTH OTHER FACILITIES AS WELL AS PERHAPS CANCEL -- PROCEDURES AND THE LIKE AS A RESULT OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT STAFFING SO I DO HAVE A COLLEAGUE HERE WITH ME TODAY FROM THE HEALTH SIDE LIKE THE TURNED OVER HER AT THIS POINT. TO SHARE HER VIEWS. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANGELA GILYARD AND I REPRESENT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM I AM THE DIRECTOR STATE HEALTH POLICY. AND I JUST HAVE A BRIEF STATEMENT THAT -- YOU SEE USES CONTRACT WORKERS ONLY WHEN NECESSARY TO FILL VACANCIES OR WHEN OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUT BECAUSE OF BECAUSE THEY ARE ON FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE -- AT THE UC DAVIS CENTER FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE GIVES HEALTH CENTER AND CAMPUS. THERE WERE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE TAKEN FMLA FROM JANUARY ONE TO LAST MONDAY. CONTRACT OR CONTINGENCY HALF WORKERS HAVE BEEN USED TO FILL SOME OF THESE TEMPORARY GAPS WHEN THE EMPLOYEES RETURN THEIR JOBS ARE WAITING. HOWEVER A CA FOURTEEN WITH DEAN THE TEMPORARY WORKERS AS EMPLOYEES AFTER ONLY TEN DAYS SO THEORETICALLY AT UC DAVIS FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN JANUARY ONE AND NOW -- WE WOULD HAVE ADDED UP TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES AND AS YOU CAN SEE THIS POLICY GETS EXPENSIVE AND BECOMES IMPRACTICAL AND UNWORKABLE OVER TIME. I THERE IS A MYTH THAT USE HE DOESN'T WANT TO FILL ITS VACANT POSITIONS HOWEVER YOU SEE HAS A RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING PROCESS TO FILL VACANT POSITIONS BUT MANY POSITIONS. AT ALL LEVELS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FILL. FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN AT UC DAVIS AT THE HOSPITAL AT THE MEDICAL CENTER AND AT THE CAMPUS THERE FOURTEEN HUNDRED OPEN POSITIONS. BETWEEN THE MAIN CAMPUS AND MEDICAL CENTERS FOR AN OVERALL VACANCY RATE OF ABOUT 11% JUST AT THAT ONE CAMPUS. THIS WILL VARY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS. BUT THE CONTRACT USERS CONTRACT WORKERS ARE USED TO FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS ARE SELF SUSTAINING. AND INCOME GENERATED BY THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS PROVIDE FINANCIAL TO SUPPORT SUPPORT TO OUR HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. NO OTHER HOSPITAL WOULD FACE THE KIND OF CONSTRAINT ACA FOURTEEN WILL PLACE WHEN YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS WHICH WILL PLACE THEM AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AS THEY COMPETE WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. YOU SEE HOSPITAL'S OPERATING% HIGHLY REGULATED AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FISCAL DECISIONS LIKE A CA FOURTEEN CAN AFFECT THE LONG RANGE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR MEDICAL CENTERS. AND WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING LOWER COSTS IN HEALTHCARE AND A CA FOURTEEN WOULD ADD SUBSTANTIAL COST TO HEALTHCARE. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AC. FOURTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION YES HI KAREN CIRCUIT SCENE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FINANCE NOTES AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO SUPPORT IN CHRISTY'S ACOSTA NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS.

AND FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS EVERYBODY WHO WORKED AT THE LAB WAS AN EMPLOYEE. THEN THEY CONTRACTED OUT. THE A CAFETERIA WORKERS. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING PEOPLE WITH PENSIONS ARE PEOPLE WITH BENEFITS UP THEY WERE AT THE MERCY. OF A CONTRACTOR. AND THEY LOS SENIORITY THAT LOST RIGHTS THEY LOST -- SICK DAYS.

THEN WHEN THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL -- THEY STARTED A WELL WE'LL LAW CONTRACT OUT THE THE ARTISTS WHO WORK FOR US PEOPLE WHO -- DO OUR PRESENTATIONS AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE LAB MAGAZINE WHICH I WAS AN EDITOR WERE THEN CONTRACTED OUT -- THEN THEY CONTRACTED OUT SCIENTISTS PEOPLE WHO WERE ON FIVE YEAR CONTRACTS.
