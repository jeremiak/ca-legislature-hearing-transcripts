GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO OUR BUDGETS UP THREE MEETING I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE BUT I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT. THEY WERE IN THE. AND EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT OF LEGISLATIVE EGG EGG BEATER. AGAIN OUR BILLS OUT OF. COMMITTEE OF WORDS IN THIS WEEKEND IT'S YOU KNOW. CRAZY MAKING. AYE OF MAY HAVE TO GET OUT BUT AT SOME POINT DURING THE MEETING AND PRESENT A BILL. IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE AS WE MAY NEED TO TAKE A BREAK AT THAT POINT BUT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE HERE AND READY TO BEGIN AND LEADING OFF THIS MORNING GUY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A PANEL OF STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN. A WORKING VERY HARD OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE WHALE AND THE. A A A A AD AND AND OTHER MAMMAL ENTANGLEMENT PROBLEM THAT'S OCCURRING NOT ONLY ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST LINE BUT. A ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE URBAN WILDLIFE INTERFACE IN THE CHALLENGES. THAT THAT WE FACE IN THAT REGARD BEARS GETTING INTO GARBAGE CANS MOUNTAIN LION ENCOUNTERED AND. ENCOUNTERS IN FRONT YARDS ARE PARK SIR. DOES HAVE LEAVE ME HEAD ON OUR HIGHWAYS BUT WE OFTEN DON'T REALIZE THAT WE INCREASINGLY FACE. SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN THE OCEAN. AND AS VAST AS THEY MAY SEEM. IT'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS US. I HERE TODAY FOR A MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE MADE AN INVESTMENT TO A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTOF MONEY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ASSIST WITH EXPENSES THAT THE SMALL GROUP OF. LICENSED ENTITLEMENT RESCUE VOLUNTEERS INCUR. THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN ENTANGLEMENTS WARRANTED THIS IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR THESE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND. AND. MY PIN WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST INVEST IN RESPONSE WE NEED TO TAKE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES AS WELL. TODAY WE'LL HEAR FROM EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ON WHAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE. AT THREE UP PANELISTS. GUERRA. I HAD THOUGHT WE'RE EXPECTING A MISTER NOAH OPPENHEIM A WITH THE PACIFIC COAST. FEDERATION OF FEOFFEES RUNS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS UNABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP HERE TODAY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LEAVES STURGES WHO WAS ON THE PANEL WILL COVER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS GOING TO COVER. AND TO US SO. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT ONE IS JUST TOO SELF INTRODUCTION SINCE WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE. AND TO WELCOME HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT DIALOGUE. VERY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF MANY OF TIME THAT CAME WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN CALIFORNIA I RUN OUR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES INITIATIVE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE% ISSUE OF WELL TANGLING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. IF YOU WANT OKAY MY NAME IS LEO STURGIS I REPRESENTING SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION AND I'VE BEEN DOING WHILE LIFE ADVOCACY WORK FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND I'M CURRENTLY DOING A DOCUMENTARY ON WILL ENTANGLEMENT WHICH HAS LED ME TO. FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT THE SUBJECT. THEM. JOHN FEET TACOS FROM THEM IRANIAN. TOUCHED MINE IS STRONGER YEAH. WE'VE DEVELOPED SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT WE THINK COULD HELP. PREVENT WELL ENTANGLEMENT. DATA DAVE ANDERSON AYE RUN CAPTAIN DAVE'S DOLPHIN WELL SAFARI AND I ALSO FORMED ORANGE COUNTY'S FIRST WELL RESCUE GROUP AND BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ENTANGLING WELLS FOR ABOUT THE LAST TEN YEARS. GREAT OR WATCH PROCEED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION PLEASE. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR HEARING US TODAY. SO. UNDER THE NORTH AMERICAN MODEL OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE IS A PART OF THE PUBLIC TRUST AND CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL RESOURCE. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTS BLUE WHALES HUMPBACKS AND SEA TURTLES. AND THE MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO TECHNICALLY MAKES EACH ENTANGLEMENT A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. HERE'S A MAP OF ENTANGLEMENT LOCATIONS KNOW WAS LAST OFFICIAL REPORT IS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN SO I'M GOING PRIMARILY OFF THOSE NUMBERS BUT I HAVE SOME UNOFFICIAL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN NUMBERS. THERE SEVENTY ONE REPORTED ENTANGLEMENTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ESTIMATES ARE THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER IS ABOUT TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT. I JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. JUST PEOPLE OUT ON THE WATER JUST HAPPENED TO SEE THESE WHALES SO THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE NUMBERS TEN TIMES THAT. THE NORTH PACIFIC HUMPBACK POPULATIONS ARE STABLE HOWEVER THE CENTRAL AMERICAN POPULATION WITH ONLY FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS IS IN JEOPARDY AND FEEDS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OFF CALIFORNIA AND OREGON. AND ALSO. TWENTY TWO OF THE TWENTY NINE VERIFIED CASES INVOLVED THE DUNGEON* CRAB FISHERY. SO THAT HAS BECOME. A AN ISSUE. OKAY. BERTHA. SO ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS. THE CONCENTRATION OF TRAPS WITH STAGGERED SEASON OPENINGS VESSELS FROM AFAR AS FAR AWAY AS ALASKA CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA AND FISH OUT THE DISTRICTS HERE BEFORE RETURNING TO THEIR DISTRICT. FOR THE OPENING SO THIS IS ALSO LED TO A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN INCOME FOR LOCAL FISHERMEN. AS LOCAL SPOTS GET PLUNDERED BY THE US LARGER VESSELS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS. SO WHEN VERY ALARMING SITUATION IS THE ENTANGLEMENT OF BLUE WHALES THE LARGEST ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WHICH FIRST OCCURRED. REPORTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH ONE BLUE WHALE THEN INCREASE TO FOREIGN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND. ARE THERE ARE THREE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO THERE'S ONLY TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO WHEELS WORLDWIDE AND JUST OVER. TWO THOUSAND ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST TROUBLING FROM ALASKA TO MEXICO IMPERILED. POPULATION. HERE WE HAVE A GRAPH WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE ESCALATION IN TELEMANN'S OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS. ON PRETTY MUCH BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS KIND OF HOVERING OVER YOU KNOW AROUND BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY. WITH SORT OF A DRAMATIC ESCALATION AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WITH TWENTY SIXTEEN. PICKING AT SEVENTY ONE REPORTED ENTANGLEMENTS. SO. YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S ESCALATED HERE. THE UNOFFICIAL NUMBER FROM NOVA FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS FORTY ONE REPORTED ENTANGLEMENTS SO THEIR HOUSE BEEN A SLIGHT PULLBACK ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE RECORDED NUMBERS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ROUGHLY ONE TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF THE ACTUAL ENTANGLEMENTS. THE NUMBERS ARE STILL ARMING. HERE ARE ENTANGLEMENT REPORTS BY COUNTY SO FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. ON YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS UP HERE. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FORTY TWO PERCENT OF REPORTED ENTANGLEMENTS WERE IN MONTEREY COUNTY. SO WE'RE SEEING. EXTREMELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ENTANGLEMENTS IS OCCURRING IN THAT ONE AREA. WHICH IS ALSO THE NATIONAL MARINE. SANCTUARY. I SPOKE TO FISHERMEN IN BODEGA BAY WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN AN ENTANGLEMENT AND THERE THIRTY YEARS ON THE WATER. I ASKED THEM TO SPECULATE YOU KNOW ABOUT WHY THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CASE AND HE SAID THAT THE CURRENTS WERE EXTREMELY STRONG IN BODEGA BAY. THAT MAY BE ONE REASON THAT YOU THE LINES ARE TALKS. AND LESS ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR NOW THIS IS SPECULATION BUT. IT'S JUST ALARMING THAT SO MANY OF THERE'D BEEN TENANTS DO A CURRENT AND MONTEREY. SO MONTEREY IS ALSO. ONE OF THE SOUTHERN MOST LOCATIONS WERE CRAP FISHING TAKES PLACE. AND ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR RELATIVELY. A SMALLER CROWD HARVEST COMPARED TO OTHER. OTHER DISTRICTS. HERE'S A MAP OF MONTEREY BAY NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY. SO COMMERCIAL FISHING IS ALLOWED IN THE SANCTUARY HOWEVER IT IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO PROTECT WHALES THE FEDERAL DESIGNATION. THERE IS ALSO A STATE MARINE RESERVE FOR COME CRUCIAL FISHING IS PROHIBITED AND THEN THE STATE MARINE CONSERVATION AREA WERE COMMERCIAL FISHING IS ALSO ALLOWED. UP THE STATE MPAS ARE CLOSER TO SHORE AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR THERE BUT THE FEDERAL MARINE SANCTUARY IS A DEEP CANYON WORDS BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS ARE OCCURRING. SO ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT OF EACH FISHERMAN'S GEARS LOST EVERY YEAR WHICH IS A VERY. THE HIGHER UP AMOUNT. HERE'S A PIE CHART SHOWING CAUSES OF LOBSTER BAND GEAR WITH THE SECOND LARGEST PERCENTAGE. AS UNKNOWN. I AS AN UNKNOWN BECAUSE. SO EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TWO TOTAL TRAPS WERE REPORTED LOST IN TWO YEARS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO THIS IS NOT INCLUDE LOS TRAPS THAT WERE NOT REPORTED. SO YOU HAVE THE VARIOUS. THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING THIS WHETHER BEING THE LARGEST ONE AND SORRY UNKNOWN CAUSES. WELL AND THEN FOLLOWED BY WHETHER. CURRENTLY DISENTANGLE MEN'S ARE HANDLED BY VOLUNTEERS WITH LITTLE FUNDS AND RESOURCES THE VOLUNTEERS ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES TO GET UP NEXT TO THE WHALE THE CUT THE ROPE OFF WITH A KNIFE. AND LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF ATTEMPTED DISENTANGLE MEN'S OUR SUCCESSFUL. THE CALENDAR CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB. FISHING WORKING GROUP PROVIDES GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY THEY HAVE CREATED A BEST PRACTICES GUIDE AND THE RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM. HOWEVER PARTICIPATION IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES BY FISHERMEN ARE TOTALLY VOLUNTARY. THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO COMPLY WITH GUIDELINES IF THEY DECIDE. AND ALSO THE PUBLIC IS NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND THESE MEETINGS. SO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. ELECTRONIC TRACKING IS APPEALING SOLUTION BECAUSE IT WOULD BOTH HELP. BOTH WALES AND FISHERMEN PLACING TRACKING DEVICES ON BOOZE WOULD NOT ONLY TRACK LAST YEAR BUT A CONTRACT A WHALE THAT'S ENTANGLED IN THE GEAR. AND PROVIDE ITS WHEREABOUTS YOU COULD ALSO PROVIDE DETAILED REAL TIME DATA REPORTS ABOUT WHERE TRAPS ARE SET. NOW WE HAVE ROPE REALPLUS THOSE ARE AMY OF ROPE WAS POP UP LUIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE HERE. AND THAT'S NOT VERY EXCITING OPTION BECAUSE YOU ELIMINATE THE VERTICAL LINES IN THE WATER PREVENTING ANY ENTANGLEMENTS. I ALSO SEE THIS AS A BONUS TO FISHERMEN BECAUSE. THEY LIKE TO KEEP THEIR FISHING SPOTS SECRET SO THIS WOULD YOU KNOW PREVENT OTHER FISH AMENDED FOR COMING INTO THE AREA SEEING WHERE THEY HAVE PLACED THEIR TRAPS SO I SEE THIS AS A BENEFIT TO FISHERMEN. AND ANOTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IS BIODEGRADABLE ROPE. APPARENTLY THE. MANY OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR MOST OF ENTITLEMENTS ACROSS THE FIRST THIRTY FATHOMS OF THE LINE OF THOSE OFFERS HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET OF LINE. AND THOSE FIRST THIRTY FATHOMS A ROPE COULD BE REPLACED BY A DISSOLVED OR BREAK AWAY LINE SO THAT'S ANOTHER. IDEA THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND AROUND. FINALLY ANOTHER SOLUTION WHICH ADDRESSES THE CONCENTRATION OF TRAPS IS HAVING THE SEASON OPENER ON THE SAME DAY ACROSS EVERY DISTRICT. THIS PAST YEAR SOME DISTRICTS OPEN ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH WHILE OTHERS OPENED ON DECEMBER FIRST. CHOOSING ONE DATE WOULD BE A SAVING GRACE FOR SMALLER LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITIES AS IT WOULD PREVENT LARGER VESSELS FROM OUT FROM OTHER DISTRICTS FROM FISHING OUT LOCAL AREAS ROOF ROOF BEFORE RETURNING TO THEIR DISTRICT. FOR THEIR OPENING. THIS GIVES LARGER FLEETS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. THIS PAST YEAR I WENT OUT WITH THE FISHERMEN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE OPENING AND ALREADY THERE WAS A HUGE DECLINING CRAB THE FISHERMAN EXPLAINED HOW THE HOW THE LARGEST HARVEST. POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE MOST MONEY IS RIGHT AFTER THE START OF THE SEASON. SO I REALLY SEE THIS SEASON OPENING WITH IT WITH A HUGE CONCENTRATION OF TRAPS BEING. A REALLY ABOUT A BIG PROBLEM IN THE CAUSE OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS. AND SO HERE ARE VARIOUS PAPA BUOYS WHICH WERE CREATED TO SERVE THE NEEDS FOR IMPROVE SAFETY IN THE WATER BY REMOVING POTENTIAL DANGEROUS SURFACE MARKER BUOYS AND THERE ARE. VARIOUS. REASONS THAT THIS IS DANGEROUS YOU KNOW BOATS PASSING AT NIGHT. CAN GET. THERE PROP CAUGHT IN THAT. WALES UNTANGLED THAT I'D SEE TOWARDS UNTANGLED SO THAT WE REALLY LOOK LIKE THE SPIDEY OF POP UPS. IN CLOSING ELIMINATING VERTICAL LINES IN THE WATER WOULD AND CALIFORNIA ENTANGLEMENTS. FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR TESTING OF THE VARIOUS OPTIONS. OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY WE WANT TO TAKE FOR STEPS TODAY TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM. PLANS IMPLEMENT PROVEN TECHNOLOGIES THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW THAT COULD STOP WILL ENTANGLEMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO URGE. ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE STATE TO TAKE STEPS TO SEE HOW WE CAN USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND UP NEXT YEAR OF NEXT. JUST A BIT OF HISTORY ABOUT. PRODUCT THAT DUH I INVENTED. ABOUT CITIES A GUY. BECAUSE OF I. ENTANGLEMENTS LE ONE NIGHTS HAVE BEEN ON THE WATER AROUND AND ABOUT WAS DISABLED AND NEARLY LOST BECAUSE OF ENTANGLEMENT IN FISHING GEAR.AND. PROBABLY A BAD I USE LYDA ALL ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING ABOUT MOM IDEA. AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF. THE APPLICATIONS I WOULD SAY IN ONE OF THEM WAS WHILE ENTANGLEMENT AS WELL UNITS STRIA AND ALSO SAFETY REASONS. WE MIGHT EFFORTS BACKING NAUGHTY NAUGHTY AYE TO THE IT'S RYAN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THE. FISHING INDUSTRY. WASN'T INTERESTED IN AB TECHNOLOGY BACK THEN. NOW FOR VARIOUS REASONS. AND. WHO US TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN SELLING NOW POP UP BOYS TO? A FRIEND'S PROM RESEARCH AND HOW OR WHEN GAS. WE MIGHT HAVE FOODS OUT TO THE. U. S. DIFFERENCE THE PROBLEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. AND. SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN SELLING TO THEM ON AND OFF. THE LAST ORDER THAT WE SUPPLIED WAS THREE WEEKS AGO. AND LUCK WAS WITH THE US RIDE DIFFERENCE DEPARTMENT. WILL SAID SO TO. JAPAN MALAYSIA SINGAPORE. AND. BILL JUNE WHICH WAS GRAYSON WAY AS WELL. SORRY AT TECHNOLOGIES. NO WE FEEL WAS BEEN PROVEN OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. PSYOP POP UP BOY. IF WHOSE BRAIN USE DUH CERTAINLY NOT WELLS WOULD BE ENTANGLED IN ANY OF THOSE LINES. WE'VE. RESEARCH STILL BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT MARKET FOR THE TWENTIES WE HAVE SOME. GREAT AUNTIES AND. HAVE WE CAN HELP THE INDUSTRY. WE UNDERSTOOD PROBABLY TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT. THE MARKET DOES NOT EXIST ON TO. SOMEONE. SAYS THAT THE FISHERMEN REALLY NAY TO USAID SINGS. WE'VE INTRODUCED IT TO THE FISHERMEN OF. MANY HE'S. AND THE RESPONSE WE HAVE IS A IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT BUT. NO ONE REALLY WHICH IS TO COMMIT SAWS. WE HE'D JUST DECIDE THAT. THERE'S TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT DOES WORK. AND COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SON. IT. COULD. THANK YOU. IS SO. WE WE DO DISENTANGLE MEANT WORK UNDER. NO IS A FLORIDA WERE ACTUALLY TRAINED BY NO ADDED TO. DISENTANGLE WELLS AND ON PART OF THE. NETWORK OF TEAMS. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT. DO THESE DISENTANGLE METS. AND. I CAN TELL YOU IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THESE ANIMALS UNTANGLE WE HAD OUT WE HAD A WELL YESTERDAY THAT WAS ENTANGLED RIGHT OFF OF DANA POINT. THAT WE. TRIED TO HELP BUT WE FAILED. AND THIS HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON PREVENTION. A I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE GIVING US MONEY FOR. FOR THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT OF THAT THAT'S A BLESSING AND WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. IT'S BEEN NEEDED THAT WE HAD TO SPEND OUR OWN MONEY FOR A LOT OF YEARS TO DO THIS. BUT. THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF MONEY SPENT ON PREVENTION OF THIS PROBLEM THERE'S. JUST A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM. AND WE WERE JUST REALLY. SEEING SO MANY WELLS IN TANGLED AYE I HAD. A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD A BLUE WELL THAT WAS ENTANGLED. AND. WE. WHERE WE ARE UNABLE TO HELP IT? AND. THEWELL PROBABLY DIED AND ANOTHER WELL THAT WAS ANOTHER BLUE WELL THAT WAS ENTANGLED. NOAH DIDN'T PUT IT TRACKING BILLY ON. AND THAT THEY HAD ONE BUT THEY DIDN'T PUT IT ON THERE AND I ARGUED WITH THEM ONE OF THEM TO PUT IT ON. BUT THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT ON AND WHY. BECAUSE THEY WERE UNSURE OF WHETHER THE WHALE WOULD GO OFF TO SEE. AND THIS BILL ANYWAYS FIFTY POUNDS. AND THE BULLY. TEARS INTO THE FLESH OF THE WELL SAID BECAUSE IT HUESO MUCH SO I WORKED ON DESIGNING A NEW BOOTY. THAT ARE ONLY WEIGHS ELEVEN POUNDS AND IT'S GREAT HOWEVER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT? OF THE UNITED STATES CAN'T MAKE A BUOY THAT WEIGHS LESS THAN FIFTY POUNDS. I MEAN THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EFFORT BEING SPENT ON THESE ANIMALS. TO HELP THEM AND WE NEED A WE NEED MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO THIS. IF THEY WERE SEVENTY ONE WHAT OF WHALES BEING COACHED BY POACHERS RIGHT NOW. HOW MUCH WOULD WE SPEND ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STOP THAT? NOT HOW MUCH ATTENTION WOULD BE PAID TO IT. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT'S TOTALLY SOLVABLE. THIS MAN RIGHT HERE. HE HAS A BULLY I DON'T I DON'T WORK FORM. HE'S JUST ITS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT HE HAS A BUOY THAT HE'S BEEN USING FOR YEARS. IT WORKS THERE'S NO REASON THAT ALL THE FISHERMEN IN THIS WHOLE STATE COULDN'T BE USING THAT BILLY. AND WE BASICALLY AND THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE MOST OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS THEY'RE HAPPENING OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHAT WE SEE. IS FROM THESE. THESE BOWIE'S WITH ROPES SO IF YOU HAVE NO ROPE AND NO BUOY YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME MONEY. YOU KNOW PUT TOWARDS THIS PROBLEM. AND THE AND WE NEED TO TO HAVE REQUIRED THE FISHERMEN. TO USE THESE BUOYS AND GIVEN FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER TIME YOU THEY NEED TO GET EVERYTHING UP AND RUNNING. AND THEN GIVE THEM SOME HELP GIVING SOME SOME MONEY TO PAY FOR THE BULLIES AND THE PROBLEM SOLVED. YOU KNOW WE'RE OUT THERE RISKING OUR LIVES TRYING TO HELP WHALES AND MOST THE TIME WE FAIL. I MEAN I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE YESTERDAY GO SEE MY MOTHER IN THE HOSPITAL WHO WHO'S DYING. OR GO HELP WELL I WHAT I CHOSE TO HELP THE WELL BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE TO DO IT. AND WE FELT SO I MADE A BAD CHOICE I'VE I WISH I WOULD'VE GONE TO SEE MY MOM. ANYWAY THANK YOU. SO ONCE AGAIN MY NAME'S TOM THAT'S HIM WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB. FISHING YOU'RE WORKING GROUP THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER PRESENTATION. I'VE BEEN A PART OF THAT GROUP SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN SEPTEMBER. TWENTY FIFTEEN FOLLOWING THE INCREASE IN THE OBSERVE ENTANGLEMENTS OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THOUGH THAT THIS IS IN FACT A GLOBAL ISSUE THE ON AND NOT UNINTENTIONAL. ENTANGLEMENT OF WHALES AROUND THE WORLD IS ONE OF THE. IF NOT THE. TOP SOURCE OF HUMAN CAUSED MORTALITY FOR WELL POPULATIONS MANY OF WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE THREATENED AYE OR ENDANGERED. NOW THIS WORKING GROUP. HIS FOLKS WE HAD THREE TOP GOALS. UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF. OF DRIVERS FOR ENTANGLEMENT RISK REDUCING ENTANGLEMENT RISK AND IN FACT THAT'S WHERE WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME ELIMINATING THIS PROBLEM BY AVOIDING ENTITLEMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN AS AN EARLIER SPEAKER SAID IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RESPONSE WHEN. WHALES ARE IN FACT. ENTANGLED IN IN FISHING HERE SO THOSE ARE THREE TOP GOALS I I WILL SAY THAT THIS GROUP HAS BEEN UNIQUE AND PRODUCTIVE IT'S A MULTI STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OF THE FEW FOLKS AROUND THE TABLE IN ADDITION TO. CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE. COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL HARVESTERS STATE AND FEDERAL. FISHERIES MANAGERS AS WELL AS. WHERE RESEARCHERS AND AND? WELL RESCUE. REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL SO I THINK IT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A REALLY VALUABLE MODEL FOR HOW. CITY CALIFORNIA CAN. COALESCING ADDRESSING. AN URGENT CONSERVATION ISSUE LIKE THIS. WITHIN THE STATE. THE INDUSTRY MEMBERS OF THAT GROUP HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE FROM THE START AND AND REALLY PRODUCTIVE AND PROACTIVE IN. HELPING TO IDENTIFY. NEW WAYS TO TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THIS WORK HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ALONG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. AND I JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH OUR PROGRESS IN THE CHIEF AND ADVANCING THOSE THREE GOALS. SO IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS OF THIS RISK EVERYONE THAT YOU COULD SEE THAT. THAT CHART THAT WAS. PRESENTED EARLIER THE TABLE WITH REGARD TO INCREASE IN OBSERVED ENTANGLEMENTS. AND IT IT JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT YOU AND IT JUMPED OUT AT BY THE FALL TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT SOMETHING NEW WAS HAPPENING HERE. AND SOMETHING NEED TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. SO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE CONVENE A MEETING WHICH LAUNCHED THIS WORKING GROUP. SINCE THAT TIME THAT THAT GROUP STARTED WITH HOW HOW WOULD WE KNOW ABOUT THE DRIVERS FOR FOR THAT PATTERN. WHAT CAN WE LEARN AND WE REALLY STARTED WITH INFORMATION GATHERING AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND? WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TERMS THE OCEAN YOU RECALL IT? OVER THESE THREE YEARS ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OCEAN TEMPERATURES EL NINO EVENTS THE WARM. WATER BLAH THAT THAT SET OFF THE COAST FOR SO LONG AND AND. AND CHANGE SO MUCH IN OUR OCEANS THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO CHANGES AND. FOR IMPORTANTLY CREEL ANCHOVIES AND SARDINES WITH CHEESE WELLS ARE HERE TO FEED ON. AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE OCEAN CHANGES MEANT FOR FORAGE WITH THOSE SPORTS CHANGES MEANT FOR THE WHALES AND THEN GATHER MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IN PARALLEL WITH THE CHANGE IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE CRAB FISHERY SEASONALITY INTIMIDATION THE EFFORT. OF THAT FLEET HAS CHANGED OVER THESE YEARS AS WELL. AS WE TRY TO REALLY GET AT. WHAT WERE THE OVERLAP OR THE INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN SOME OF THOSE CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE WATER AND IN THE FISHERY AND WHAT? A WHY DID THEY RESULT OR HOW DID THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THE INCREASE IN OBSERVING TANG WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. I ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I WANT CALL OUT IN THIS SECTION IS A WE DID A LOT OF ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGES AND SOME OF THE STORIES IN THE DISENTANGLE AND EFFORTS. LEARNING AS MUCH AS WE COULD AND AND REALLY LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE THE HARVESTERS IN THE ROOM. TO BASICALLY DO FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE COULD LEARN ABOUT THE NATURE OF HOW I WHAT FISHER WAS INVOLVED WHEN THAT ATTAINMENT OCCURRED AND HOW THAT WELL ACTUALLY INTERACTED WITH THAT YOUR AND ENDED UP IN ENTANGLED IN IT. SO OUR NEXT GOAL WAS A REDUCING THE RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT IN A AFFORD FACING WHEN AND AS I SAID THIS IS ON THE BULK OF OUR WORK. EARLIER THEY MENTIONED THE. SOMEONE MENTION THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDE SO. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT FORENSIC REVIEW OF OF IT PRIOR ENTANGLEMENTS? AND THE THE EXPERTISE OF. SOME OF THE DISENTANGLE MEANT RESPONDERS WAS THAT A LOT OF THOSE INTERACTIONS WERE HAPPENING AT THE SURFACE AT WHAT IN THE THAT PART OF THAT CRAP. SET UP THAT WE CALL THE TOP HERE WHICH IS THE BUOYS AND ROPES FLOATING I OFTEN AT THE SURFACE. THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT. FOLKS COULD. TIGHTEN UP HOW THEY WERE DOING THAT AND THEY WERE SORT OF. I NEED FOR ESTABLISHED BEST PRACTICES AND TO REDUCE THE PROFILE OF THAT AND THEREBY REDUCE THE RISK THAT AN ANIMAL GET ENTANGLED IN THAT YEAR. SO WITH THAT INDUSTRY WE DEVELOPED. WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS ABOUT THAT BEST PRACTICES GUIDE IN HAVE CIRCULATED THAT THROUGHOUT THE FISHERY. AND A LOT OF THOSE QUALITIES VOLUNTARY LOT OF. THOSE PRACTICES HAVE. HAVE INCREASED UP AND DOWN THE COAST THE NEXT THING WE FOCUSED ON IS LOST YOUR INITIATIVES SO THE END OF THE SEASON WOULDN'T SOMEONE MENTIONED A LOT HERE SO I'D YEARS UNINTENTIONALLY LAS SOMETIMES IT'S. DRAGGED UP BY ANOTHER BOAT OR TUGBOAT ARE MOVED BY STORM ARE STUCK. SO WE'VE GOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS. IN ENSURING THAT ALL THAT YOU'RE. COMES OUT OF THE WATER AT THE END OF THE SEASON IT DOESN'T CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A RISK OF OF ENTITLEMENT MOVING FORWARD. AND WE'RE INVESTING IN TOOLS. AND PORTRAIT APPROACH JUST HELP EXPEDITE AND IMPROVE THE SCALING OF OF THOSE EFFORTS AND THAT WORK IS ONGOING. ALSO. THIS GROUP HAS RECOMMENDED A UNIFORM YOU'RE MARKING AND THIS IS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NATURE THESE ENTANGLEMENTS. THE CRAB FISHERY IS ONE PART OF THIS PROBLEM BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY FISH IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS. CAUSED ENTANGLEMENTS NAM OR ALONG THE WEST COAST FOR THAT MATTER SO DIE UNIFORM. FISHING GEAR MARKING WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING US UNDERSTAND BUT WE DO HAVE AN ENTANGLEMENT. WHAT WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT IN ORDER TO PREVENT A FUTURE ENTANGLEMENT SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY IN A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL I SP THIRTEEN OH NINE WHICH IS MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW? ONE OF THE. MOST PRODUCTIVE I THINK WHAT MOST. POTENTIALLY A HIGHEST IMPACT. AREAS OF OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN IN AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. AND THIS IS TAKING ALL THOSE FACTORS THAT WE LEARNED WHAT'S CHANGING IN THE OCEAN WHAT'S CHANGING IN THE FORGE WHAT THE WHALES DOING WITH THE FISHERY DOING. AND CREATING BATES GOING EARLY WARNING SYSTEM A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE OF THE YEAR SPECIFIC RISK WHAT WE KNOW BASED ON THOSE FACTORS WE GET SAY OKAY THIS IS THAT A BASICALLY A NORMAL YEAR. OR WE HAVE SOME MODERATE MODERATELY ELEVATED RISK WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED RISK I'M WE NEED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE MITIGATING STEPS SO WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS FIRST OF ITS KIND. ADAPTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CHARACTERIZE RISK AHEAD OF THE SEASON AND DURING THE SEASON AND. THROUGH THIS MULTI STAKEHOLDER PROCESS RECOMMEND TO. IMMEDIATE MITIGATING STEPS NONE MOVING FORWARD SO WERE PILOTING THAT NOW WE'VE LEARNED A TON ABOUT THAT AND ON THAT THE MODEL THEY THINK HAS REAL POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ACROSS FISHERIES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'M WE ARE SUPPORTING THE WORKING GROUP IS POINTING AT ONGOING RESEARCH INTO A NUMBER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR INNOVATION REDUCING THE LINE PROFILE USING BREAKAWAYS. I AND OTHERS SOME WORK IN. THE WE LIST OR ACOUSTIC RELEASE TRAPS AT WORK HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT HERE. I THINK THAT IS VERY PROMISING WORK ON IT THAT AN EXPERIMENTAL PHASE I THINK. WE'RE. VERY INTERESTED IN AND EXPLORING THE MECHANICS THE OPERATIONS THE COSTS TO THE THE DOWNSIDE OF OF MOVING FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I DO THINK IT IS PROMISING. THE FINAL THING I AM IS IMPROVING THE RESPONSE WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN BUILDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY OF ART THE CONTAINMENT NETWORK. WE'VE DONE HUNDRED AND WE'VE DONE SEVERAL TRAININGS RESULTING IN ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED A NEW FIRST RESPONDERS THESE ARE MOSTLY COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN. WHO SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE WATER TRYING TO LEVERAGE THEIR EXPERTISE AND? THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN OBSERVING ENTANGLED ANIMALS IDENTIFYING THAT AND AN INITIATING THAT THE RESPONSE THAT ON THE PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED. BUT WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN IMPROVED AND REDESIGNED TOOLS TO HELP FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE ENTANGLEMENT. AND SAY CONTENTMENT ON THE WATER. SO IN CLOSING. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL THREAT TO TO WALES ON CALIFORNIA'S COAST THAT WORK IS ONGOING. IT IS. FAR FROM DONE THERE'S THERE'S STILL PLANNING TO DO. AND YET THE RESULTS OF OUR WORK IS ALREADY BEING SHARED AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR OTHER REGIONS OTHER FISHERIES FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HEARD WHAT'S. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN NEW ENGLAND AS WELL SO CALIFORNIA'S FAR FROM ALONE IN IN. TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS. I AND THERE CONTINUES TO BE A REAL NEED TO INVEST IN EXPERIMENTATION AND NEW SOLUTIONS. AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH AND LOOK FOR DEBT TO WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THE DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE AND AND SO MANY OTHERS TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THAT WORK GETS DONE. IT'S GREAT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I'VE IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM THE DIET SO WILL THAT ASK OF FATHER ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO BE HEARD ON THIS ISSUE. SITE INFORMATION ONLY BUT WE DO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING CUT NO ONE I WILL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WHAT WE DO. YOU SO MUCH FOR I'M HAVING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PRESENTATION. LEAH. INCREDIBLE TEAM ACTUALLY BEEN OUT ON. WELL SAFARI WITH. WITH YOUR AMAZING ORGANIZATION WE'VE BEEN ON A COUPLE OF SAFARIS THROUGH WORLD ANIMAL NEWS IS WHILE WE FILMS FOR. MY CHARITY PIECE FOR ANIMALS. AND ON THIS IS A BIG ISSUE. I'VE SEEN A PLENTY WHALES. OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA AND TANGLED. IN THESE IN THESE FISHING NETS AND ALSO. YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT THEY DROPPED TWO HUNDRED FEET DOWN IN THE OCEAN AND THEY KEEP IN THEIR FOR TWELVE HOURS AND. UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW. THERE'S SO MUCH BI CATCH THE GETS CAUGHT THAT REALLY THERE'S NO ACCURATE COUNT SO. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE FIGURES YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS FROM TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE WAS LITERALLY. I THINK FIFTEEN HUNDRED ANIMALS THAT THEY ACTUALLY COUNTED. OF WHICH YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU REALLY. GUESSTIMATE THAT IF YOU CAN'T I MEAN WITH THE AMOUNT OF FISHING LINE RUNNING MILES AND MILES AND MILES AND THE OCEAN. THERE'S REALLY NO ACCURATE WAY TO DO THAT SO. YOU KNOW MY QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW WHY ISN'T THERE. MORE FUNDING. PUT TOWARDS THIS WHY. YOU KNOW THESE ANIMALS ARE SOME OF THEM ARE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. IF WE LOSE THESE ANIMALS WHAT WILL THE IMPACT SPEED A CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY JUST CALIFORNIA BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD. YOU KNOW. IS MONEY AND GREED REALLY THAT IMPORTANT. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT. WE HAVE TO PLACE MORE VALUE ON LIFE. AND I THINK THAT GOES WITH ALL ENDANGERED SPECIES ALL ANIMALS WE SHARE THIS PLANET WITH EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION SPECIES OF WHICH. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE REST UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION THAT ARE IN THE RAINFOREST OF WHICH WERE CUTTING DOWN AT AN ALARMING RATE. GETS EVERY. TWO FOOTBALL FIELDS EVERY HALF AN HOUR. FOR SOMETHING CALLED PALM OIL. AND OF COURSE LOGGING IS ANOTHER ISSUE BUT. THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE PUTTING. ON THE VALUE. OF. SOMETHING THAT. WELL NOT OUTLIVE US. DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE VALUE THAT WE CAN PUT ON SOMETHING THAT WILL OUTLIVE US. WHICH IS LIFE. SO. WE LEAVE WITH COMPASSION I UNDERSTAND THAT. BEING HERE IT'S IT'S A LOT OF FIVE FIGURES AND NUMBERS AND. THIS RIGHT THING TO DO IN THIS IS BUSINESS. WELL. YOU CAN'T TAKE BUSINESS WITH YOU WHEN YOU DIE. BUT YOU CAN LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION. ON THIS PLANET AND THE REST OF THIS PLANET'S SPECIES AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR US IT'S NOT JUST FOR HUMANS. BECAUSE THIS IS JUST WORK RELEASING THIS LAND. THIS IS JUST THIS IS A GIFT AND IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS GIFT THIS IS OUR ONLY PLANET. TAKE CARE OF THIS PLANET BEFORE WE GO TO VISIT OTHER PLANETS. SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HA THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A PLANET WITHOUT THE SPECIES. AND I REFUSE TO SEE A PLAN WITHOUT THE SPECIES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE FIGHTING SO HARD. TO PROTECT THEM STEP. THANK YOU FOR THAT BIT OF INSPIRATION AND IT CAN I SHARE JUST ONE THING REAL QUICK. WE DO HAVE TO WRAP UP BUT JEFF YOU CAN DO IT FOR EQUITY ARE HIGH WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT I KNOW THAT THE FISHERMEN CARE ABOUT THESE ANIMALS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO CATCH THEM. AND I KNOW THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CARE I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT THE PROBLEM IS. THAT NO ONE CAN DECIDE ON HOW TO DO IT. AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE NEED IS A SOLUTION THAT WE KNOW WORKS AND? HONESTLY THIS GUY HAS ONE THAT REALLY WORKS IT'S IT ALREADY IS IN PRACTICE IT'S BEING USED. IT'S NOT A PROTOTYPE IT'S A WORKING. IT'S BEING SOLD IT'S BEEN SO IT THE MILITARY IS THAT. AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET THE PRICE DOWN WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE IF WE MASS PRODUCE IT AND THIS COULD BE USED THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL WORK ANYWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU I THINK I EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE THAT OF. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU HELPING A SHUTTLE LITTLE A ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON WHAT I THINK IS. AYE EVERYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT IT FEELS IT'S IMPORTANT BUT NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE KNOW SO NOW FEW MORE DO AND. WILL KEEP ON MOVING FORWARD. AND ARGUE ALL THINGS RICHARD THANKS FOR HAVING. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FIVE TWO I ISSUE TO. THROUGH FIVE THAT'S DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. GOOD MORNING WILL. WELL WE'RE GETTING SITUATED TO. LET ME JUST ANNOUNCED IT WILL TAKE ISSUES TWO THROUGH FIVE. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR PARKS AND RECREATION ASKED THEM TO JUST MOVE. THROUGH OUR EACH OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT DEPARTMENT. WHEN ISSUE FIVE AFTER SHE FIVE IT'S BEEN. ADDRESSED. MY MISTER CHAIRMAN ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND WE SMOG AND THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. I'M IN BEFORE WE DISCUSS OUR INDIVIDUAL BUDGET REQUESTS OF LIKE TO GIVE YOU REALLY A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE EFFORTS HAD BEEN UNDERWAY BLOOM AT THE DEPARTMENT. THE PARKS BOARD COMMISSION IT WAS A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. TO DO A TOP DOWN REVIEW OF IRAQ OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW STRENGTH IN THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE STATE PARK SYSTEM IT RELEASED ITS FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE ADMINISTRATION THEN IN TURN TO STAB LIST. FATIMA PARK EXPERTS THAT WAS DUBBED THE TRANSFORMATION TEAM TO DESIGN VERY SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE INITIATIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT A REPORT. THAT NEARLY GATHER DUST ON ON A SHELF SOMEWHERE. AND SO WITH YOUR HELP WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT OF LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF OUR MORE NOTABLE COLLECTIVE ACHIEVEMENTS. AND FIRST I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE MODERNIZING HOW WE ARE ORGANIZED. INFORMED BY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS WE'VE DESIGNED AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE ELIMINATING REDUNDANT ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WHILE ENHANCING KEY VISITORS SERVICE PROGRAMS ARE PLAN IS MEMORIALIZED IN OUR OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT. WE'VE ALSO DIVERSIFIED OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM. REQUIREMENT THAT OUR TOP LEADERS IN THE FIELD BE LIMITED TO ONE PROFESSIONAL GROUP HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. PART PROBLEMS ARE BEST SOLVED BY A TEAM WHICH IS WITH THAT WHICH INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS FROM A BROAD. RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS AND OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM IS NOW ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SAME PROFESSIONAL DIVERSITY. WE MODERNIZE FEE COLLECTION THEIR TECHNOLOGY DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS NOW ACCEPTED AT MORE AND MORE OF CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. WE'VE MODERNIZE HOW WE TAKE RESERVATIONS HOW WE COLLECT DATA AND REVENUE AND MANAGE THE CAMPING RESERVATION INVENTORY FOR THE PUBLIC. THE NEW DATA ALLOWS FORM MORE A MATTER INFORMED BUSINESS DECISIONS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT WHILE ALSO HELPING US IMPROVE OUR VISITORS EXPERIENCES. WE'RE HARNESSING THE POWER OF PHILANTHROPY AND PARTNERSHIPS. WE'VE CREATED MORE DIRECT LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN OUR KEY VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERS. THE FIELD AND THE LEADERSHIP TEAM BY CREATING A TEAM FOCUSED ON FACILITATING AND SUPPORTING PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT PARTNERSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO HOSTED A SUMMIT WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFIT FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE PARK DEPARTMENT IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE'VE ALSO IMPROVE PRIORITY SETTING AND WE'VE INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE PAST. ARE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE TWENTY ONE MANAGEMENT UNITS TO BE SPENT AT THE DISCRETION OF FIELDS MANAGEMENT. NOW THROUGH THE USE OF A NEW BUDGET TOOL PRIORITY BASED BUDGETING IS NOW THE NEW NORM. WHILE STILL ALLOWING PARK STAFF TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS. THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TODAY WILL BE PROVIDING YOU AN OVERVIEW. YOU SEE IT UP ON YOUR. MONITOR THEIR. WILL BE PROVIDING YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THIS NEW BUDGET TOLD WHICH WE'VE JUST. SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. AND I MUST SAY A IT IS PROVED TO BE A VERY POWERFUL TOOL. IT'S HELPED US DETERMINE HOW TO BEST ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AND IT'S ALSO HELPED US MORE MEANINGFUL WAY WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. ARMED WITH OUR PARTNERS AND PHILANTHROPIC GROUPS AND ALSO WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. ON THIS PROJECT THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING PROJECT THIS POWERFUL TOOL IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. AND. QUITE CANDIDLY JUST THE SHEER HARD WORK ON OF THE DEDICATED PART STUFF THAT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TOOL. I LIKE TO CLOSE BY THINKING THE LEGISLATURE THINKING YOU'RE STOP THINKING WHICH STAKEHOLDERS. FOR WORKING ALONGSIDE US TO MAKE THE SYSTEM OUT SYSTEMATIC CHANGES. THE TYPES OF CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PARK SYSTEM. ON IN THE PITS AND THE COUNTLESS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SESSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD I THINK IS A TESTAMENT TO. SOME KIND OF SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN THAT THIS KIND OF CHANGE COULD NOT HAPPEN JUST INTERNALLY NAM THAT IT REALLY WAS KIND OF ONE OF OUR KEY WAYS WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT. THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIP AN EXTERNAL ENGAGEMENT. AND SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR WE CAN MOVE TO THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU ALL JUST TO ADD A COMMENT AND MR FUNG MAY HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT AS WELL. OR NOT. HAVE TO. WHEN I ARRIVE TO AND WE BEGAN HOLDING HEARINGS AND AND. TWENTY THIRTEEN. HI YOUR DEPARTMENT WAS FRONT AND CENTER. AND MANY OF THE ISSUES. THAT EXISTED. WERE. ON THE. DOCKET TO TO TO BE ADDRESSED AND I FRANKLY THE DEPARTMENT WAS WASN'T A MASS. SINCE THAT TIME. IN THE RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. A THINGS HAVE REALLY TURNED AROUND. ADD TO IT A. JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE WORK THAT TO YOU IN THE MEN AND WOMEN OF. YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE DONE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES A REALITY I THINK THAT THE. PUBLIC GOTTA. EXPERIENCES THE. AT A MUCH. BETTER. OUT OVERALL PARKS EXPERIENCE TODAY THAN THEY DID TO THOSE FEW SHORT YEARS AGO. AND THAT'S TESTAMENT TO THE HARD WORK OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. PLEASE PROCEED WITH FAILURE ADDITIONAL ITEMS ON REMIND DE EVER WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. AFTER YOU'VE CONCLUDED ON ISSUE FIVE. SO GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN I MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS WILL SHOPS BY I AM THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR STATE PARKS. AND JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF SERVER SPACE BUDGETING. SO SIR SPACE BUDGET OR S. B. B. I ROSE FROM. ONE OF STATE PARKS TRANSFORMATION TEAM STRATEGIC GOALS WHICH WAS DEVELOPED TO DEVELOPMENT EXCELLENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. TO MEET THAT OBJECTIVE STATE PARKS EMBARKED ON A ROBUST DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS EFFORT LABELED SERVER SPACE BUDGET AND. THIS PROJECT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT ANALYZE SERVICE LEVELS ACROSS ITS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO BETTER INFORM FISCAL DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF OUR VISITORS AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR PARTNERS. WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW IS A HYBRID BUDGET AND SYSTEM THAT COMBINES THE BEST ASPECTS OF? ZERO BASED BUDGETING AND PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING. SO WHAT IS SERVICE BUT IN. SERVICE SPACE BUDGETING TAKES ZERO BASED BUDGETING APPROACH AND THAT IT DOCUMENTS ALL SERVICES NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. TO ACHIEVE ITS MISSION AND WE DEFINE THIS AS THE MISSION LEVEL IN THE DATA SET. THE SERVICES ARE THEN CHARACTERIZED BY PROGRAM SUCH AS FACILITIES OR VISITOR SERVICES. AND STDS SERVICES ARE COMPILED BY DOCUMENTING SMALLER LABOR TASKS A GIVEN PARK FOR EXAMPLE CHECKING A VISITOR AND AT THE NEW BRIGHTON STATE BEACH CAMPGROUND. THAT TASK WOULD THEN BE ASSIGNED HOURS COST PASSED DRIVERS SUCH AS NUMBER OF EXPECTED VISITORS. JUSTIFICATION GLOBAL STANDARDS. SUCH AS WE WANT TO GET TO TWO MINUTES PROJECT AND. AND WE WOULD THEN ASSIGN LABOR CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE ASSOCIATE OPERATING EQUIPMENT AND EXPENSES. AND THAT'S KIND OF THE PERFORMANCE SPACE BUDGET ASPECT OF SERVER SPACE BUT YOU MAY. SO ANNUALLY WE WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH TIME WE INVEST IN EACH SERVICE AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPEND ANY SERVICE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE MEETING OUR DELIVERABLES. WE ARE CURRENTLY TRANSITION INTO AN ELECTRONIC TIME KEEPING SYSTEM. WHICH WILL HELP US TRACK THIS IN A MORE AUTOMATIC FORMAT. AND ANNUALLY WOULD REFRESHED. THIS CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL SO WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FRESH DATA SAID TO ANALYZE WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S NEEDS ARE. THE DOCUMENTATION OF S. B. B. TASKS AND SERVICES WAS VERY ROBUST THE MISSION LEVEL DATA COLLECTION EFFORT SPANS ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND CAPTURES EVERY TASK THAT A STATE PARK EMPLOYEE. VOLUNTEER OR PARTNER COULD UNDERTAKE. TO ACHIEVE THIS STATE PARKS UNLISTED THIRTY THREE FIELD. AND HEADQUARTERS SUBJECT MATTER ASK SPURTS AND HELD SEVEN STATEWIDE TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OVER FOR HIM IN STATE PARKS EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE DATA GATHERING PROCESS. THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING PHASE OF THE PROJECT. WE DOCUMENTED A TOTAL OF OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND UNIQUE TASKS WITHIN STATE PARKS EACH OF THOSE TASKS HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A COST AND IS AND EACH A SCALABLE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY SKILL WAS THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED VARIABLES THAT CAN CHANGE THE COST IF WE INCREASE OR DECREASE FOR EXAMPLE. FACILITY PROJECTS OR VISITATION TO A PARK. WE HAVE ALSO DETERMINE WHICH OF THOSE TASKS AND SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDED WHICH ONES ARE NOT AND TO WHAT EXTENT. SO. THE IMPACTS AND OUTCOMES OF S. B. BEER ILLUSTRATE ON THE SLIDE IN AND AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT A CLEAR AND REALISTIC PICTURE. OF OPERATIONS IN BUDGET MANAGEMENT. PROMOTE A CULTURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS DPR BOTH TO THE PUBLIC AND WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO BUILD FISCAL INTEGRITY AND TRUST AND FACILITATE DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING FOR ALLOCATION PURPOSE. WITH SPV DATA WE ARE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT DASHBOARDS AND ANALYTICS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THE DOW SPORTS WILL NOT ONLY BE USED BY BOTH EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT. FOR RESOURCE ALLOCATION PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PURPOSES BUT ALSO BY THE VARIOUS DISTRICT OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. FOR DATA DAY OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT PURPOSES. THE DA'S FORTY SEE HERE DISPLAY SEVERAL FUNCTIONS OF SBB DATA SET. AND I KNOW IT MAY BE HARD FOR SOME FOLKS TO SEE THE SUNAND THE BACK HERE SO THIS KIND OF. ILLUSTRATE WHAT WHAT THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS ARE. THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER MEASURES THE DISTRICTS CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL NOT SHOWN THE TEAL BLUE. AGAINST ALL SERVICES OR VARIANTS WHICH WOULD BE THE BLACK. THE RED SHOWS THE AVERAGE SERVICE LEVEL ACROSS THIS DISTRICTS. THE FUEL GAUGE LOOKING GRAPH BELOW THAT SHOWS OUR CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL AGAINST MISSION LEVELIN TERMS OF DOLLARS OR P. WISE. SO WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT THE NEED IS AND CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO BETTER ALLOCATE OUR RESOURCES. ON THE RIGHT. WE WE SHOW. INDIVIDUAL PARKING AT VARIANCE IN TERMS RELATIVE TO OTHER PARTS AND DISTRICTS. IN OTHER WORDS WHICH PARKS THE MORE RESOURCE ALLOCATION THAN OTHERS. DEPICTED BY REDS OR GREEN SO THE RATS WOULD NEED MORE RESOURCE ALLOCATION THE GREENS WOULD BE LESS. SO AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING S. B. B. CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES INCLUDING A RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FORTY TWO MILLION TO ADDRESS STATE PARK SERVICE LEVELS. AND MATTER CONSISTENT WITH OUR STATE PARKS REORGANIZATION. FOR THE FIRST TIME STATE PARKS WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS THROUGHOUT EVERY LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION. DETERMINE WHERE BEST TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THE CHART ABOVE DISPLAYS ALLOCATION OF FORTY TWO MILLION OF STATE PARKS AND RECREATION FUND BY PROGRAM. IN THE PAST WE COULD ONLY MAKE THIS PRESENTATION AT A DISTRICT LEVEL AND RECENTLY A PARKING AT LEVEL THROUGH AN EFFORT CALLED PARK IN IT COSTING. HOWEVER NEITHER OF THOSE EFFORTS TO SPEAK TO PROGRAM OR SERVICE AND A USEFUL MANNER. THE HOPE HERE IS THAT THROUGHOUT THROUGH THIS EFFORT WE CAN HAVE MORE INFORMED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS IT RECEIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND MAKE INCREASINGLY BETTER DECISIONS WITH THOSE FUNDS GOING FORWARD. AND THEN OUR POLY RAN SHORT ON TIME SO LET US RECAP THAT. THE BENEFITS OF S. B. B. AGAIN. SO WE'VE GOT BETTER COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELFARE STATE PARK PARTNERS ARE VISITORS AND THE PUBLIC. WE HAVE INCREASED UNDERSTAND OF WHICH STATE PARKS PROGRAMS ARE FLOURISHING AND WHICH ONES NEED ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION. COST TRANSPARENCY FOR THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE MEANING HOW MUCH DOES IT TAKE TO RUN A CAMPFIRE PROGRAM AT CALAVERAS VICTORIES FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING THROUGH THE USE OF ANALYTICS. REPORTING FLEXIBILITY. MY UNDERTAKEN THE LARGE DATA COLLECTION EFFORT WE CAN PIVOT THE DATA TO RESPOND TO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF REQUESTS FOR DATA. AND INFORMATION CONSISTENCY SO WE HAVE ONE PLATFORM THAT NOW ALLOWS THE DIFFERENT CORNERS OF THE DEPARTMENT TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. AND THE LONGER TERM. THE CONTINUED USE OF THE DATA SET AND REFRESH NOT DOUBTS THAT WILL ALLOW THE BERMAN TO LINE WITH THE LONG TERM. GOALS OF THE STATE. WILL BE ABLE TO MORE EFFICIENTLY. DO BUSINESS AS. BEST PRACTICES ARE REVEALED IN SHARED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. S. B. B. WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE DEPARTMENTAL PERFORMANCE ON MULTIPLE LEVELS INCLUDING AT THE DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS LEVELS. AND WE HOPE TO BEGIN FEE IN EXPENDITURE DATA TIME KEEPING DATA INTO THE SYSTEM ONCE WE ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED WITH OTHER MODERNIZATION. SYSTEMS AND EFFORTS SUCH AS FISCAL AND ELECTRONIC TIME KEEPING. THAT WRAPS UP IN. I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY THANK YOU AYE I'LL JUST SAY THAT. AT AND I THINK OF THE. INFORMATION. THAT YEAR. ABLE TO UTILIZE IN YOUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS. IS REALLY ENHANCED BY THE. A SOFTWARE TOOL THAT THAT THAT THAT YOU HAVE AND. I COULD SEE WHERE THAT MIGHT HAVE APPLICABILITY IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS A AS AS WELL SEE REALLY IN THE IN THE VANGUARD HERE I THINK A. LOT ON THAT IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

FORTY TWO MILLION OF THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR POSITIONS ON I THINK A COUPLE OF REALLY KEY THINGS FOR US TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY WHOSE POSITIONS NINETY PERCENT OF THOSE POSITIONS. ARE OUT IN THE FIELDS ON THAT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE CAN MUST DIRECTLY IMPACT THE VISITOR'S EXPERIENCE. AND ALSO VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE RANK AND FILE ON THAT WE REALLY NEEDED MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF DOING THE HARD WORK ON THAT IT TAKES TO SOLVE PARKS PROBLEMS. SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS ALL IS ALSO TO TAKE CARE OF. OF OUR BUDGET STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT WE'VE HAD YOU MAY RECALL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE COME BEFORE THIS BODY FOR A ONE TIME INCREASE. THAT PERMANENTLY SOLVES THAT PROBLEM IT ALSO INCLUDES ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE A GRANTS PROGRAM ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON ON STATE LANDS.

A MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE PERMANENT A RECRUITMENT IN A TRAINING PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE EMBARKING ON THIS HIRING EFFORTS. AND THAT WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CANCELED OUR WORKFORCE ON REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ON I MIGHT SHARE WITH YOU THAT IF YOU DRIVE ALONG THE I. EIGHTY CORRIDOR YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A RECENT CAMPAIGN THAT WE'VE LAUNCHED. A RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN UP ON A BILLBOARD AND AT SOME CHOOSE THE PARKS LIFE. AND.

IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. ON FROM OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRUST FUND AND SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF SP TWO FORTY NINE. ON JUST TO REMIND FOLKS S. B. TWO FORTY NINE AM SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. LAST SUMMER MADE THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION PROGRAM A PERMANENT PROGRAM IT ALSO EXPANDED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND TO PROVIDE MORE. ON SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND TO ALSO CALL TOGETHER STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO BETTER ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC AS WE. TALK ABOUT HOW CAN THE PUBLIC IN ALL OF THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS BETTER ENGAGE. IN CALM DISCUSSIONS AND THINKING ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT FORM OF RECREATION IN CALIFORNIA.

JUST A PROCEED ONTO ISSUE FOR. ISSUE FOUR PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA THIS IS A. REVENUE GENERATION PROGRAM OUR EXISTING REVENUE GENERATION PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED STATUTORILY. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I'M SO AS PART OF OUR OVER ARCHING. GOAL OF TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE RESOURCE AND SUPPORTER IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER CALIFORNIA STATE PARK SYSTEM WE ALSO REVIEWED THIS PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN IT FOR THE FUTURE. ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS ON. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE PROGRAMS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU THAT LAST YEAR WE SPENT ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND IT YIELDED ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION AND REVENUE. SO WE THINK THAT IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DO WAS PROVIDE US A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HOW TO USE THE FUNDS UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT. WE ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED THAT ONE WE EARN REVENUE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM A PORTION OF THAT REVENUE MUST REMAIN IN THIS POT OF MONEY THAT JUST GETS PLOWED ON BACK INTO REVENUE GENERATION RATHER FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

TO ENHANCE VISITOR SERVICES IT ALSO MAKES PERMANENT. ABOUT FIVE OF OUR EXISTING REVENUE GENERATION PROJECTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REVENUE GENERATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE WE'VE CREATED ON NEW TOWERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT HEARST CASTLE.

A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN MENTIONED IT COULD BE THAT THE STATE COSTS AND UP LOWER AND AND LIKELY WILL BE LOWER THAN THEIR REQUEST BEFORE YOU BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH FORMER LESSEES TO GET SOME OF THE MONEY BACK SO.

I ALWAYS KNOW IN JANUARY. THERE WAS A LINE ITEM FOR HOW GOVERNOR PLACE WHEN WE RECOMMENDED HOLDING OPEN ABOUT TIME. I BASED ON LIKE OF INFORMATION. RELATED TO THOSE THAT EMPLOYER COSTS ARE FOR SUPPORT CAP WILDLY. THIS LETTER DOES PROVIDE A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION AND SO AT THIS TIME AYE WE OFTEN MORE CONCERNED WITH THE PROPOSAL. BUT THAT VERY MUCH UP PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NO VOTE. WE HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. EXCUSE ME. I'M JIM ANY AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. FOR SIKORSKI AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURE THE BLOCK KONKAN HIM ALSO AN ENGINEER THAT WAS ON THE ORIGINAL FIREHAWK PROGRAM AND ALSO A HELICOPTER PILOT. AND I'M AYE WE JUST WANTED TO COME UP HERE TODAY TO KIND OF TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF THIS AIRCRAFT THAT YOU GUYS ARE SELECTING OR. YOU'RE LOOKING TO PURCHASE. A WHEN I WAS ON THE PROGRAM THIS WAS AN EIGHT YEAR QUEST TO DEVELOP THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT LINE. FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS WERE SPENT JUST PICKING OUT THE BLACK HAWK ITSELF TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE CALIFORNIA TRAIN UNDER THE ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS THESE GUYS ARE FACING. AND THEY TANK THAT IS ON THE BLACK CAUCUS A THREE YEAR DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS JUST TO. DESIGN THE AIRCRAFT TO TAKE ABOARD SPECIFICATIONS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE EXACT EFFICIENCY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DROPPING WATER. AND THE CAPABILITY THAT THESE GUYS NEEDS IN THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING EVERY DAY THE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE SAFEST AIRCRAFT IN THIS WAS A MILITARY AIRCRAFT POINT FOR THE BILL TO FIELD POINT FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS. SO I'M JUST HERE TO FOR ARMY OFFICER CORPS SKI AIRCRAFT TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THOSE. KNOCKED ON IT'S GONNA TRIPLE THEIR POTENT PRODUCTIVITY FOR THE STATE IT'S GONNA TRIPLE THE RANGE OF THE KING OF THE CAPABILITY IT'S GOING TO TRIPLE THE WATER DROP. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AN INITIAL ATTACK WHEN MINUTES MATTER THOUGHTS WHEN THE AIRCRAFT AS THEY ARE AND DESIGNED TO DO. AND WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL SUPPORT CAUGHT FIRE. THINKING. I THINK YOU MUCH. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AND OTHERS WERE HOLDING THIS OPEN. A A QUESTIONS OF GREENS PASSION. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD. AIRCRAFT AND AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW WE TOOK A VERY VERY DEEP AND A LONG DIVE AND ALL OF THIS I. IF YOU'VE BEEN IN MY OFFICE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A FEW. THINGS THAT FLY ON THE WALL HOLES. AND I I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY IN THE BIDDING AND AND A LOT OF. CLAIMS MADE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AS IS OUR CUSTOM WE DUG DOWN DEEP INTO IT ASKED. AND DOUBLE LAST AND QUITE FRANKLY. OF FOR A I THINK A SMALL AMOUNT PERHAPS OF ADDITIONAL MONEY THIS IS A. VERY GOOD AIRCRAFT AND HAS. HUGE CAPABILITIES FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL MISSION. AND FOR THE SAFETY OF PILOTS IN THE GROUND CREW SO I'M I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS WHEN IT COMES FOR. US YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED APPRECIATE LA OF HAVING HIM COME AT THE END. WE ARE NOW WITH THIS LIST MULLIN HERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OUT ISSUE NINE AT THE SAME JUST GO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION A PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS LARRY GOLD SPENT ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE. SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION APPRECIATE YOU HAVING US WITH YOU TODAY. THE ISSUE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS ESSENTIALLY HOW BE C. D. C. SHOULD PAY FOREIGN ENHANCED AND INCREASED ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. CURRENTLY BCD WHICH HAS APPROVED APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND OR SO PERMITS AND AMENDMENTS TO PERMITS INCONSISTENCY DETERMINATIONS AND THE LIKE. HAS A ENFORCEMENT BACKLOG OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT OPEN CASES WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM IN OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. ONLY TWENTY THREE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT OPEN CASES ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVE BECAUSE CANDIDLY ENFORCEMENT TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY THREE PEOPLE. IT TAKES OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT BACKLOG HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED BY MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS. WHEN I JOIN BE CDC IS ACTIVE DIRECTOR IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS NO PRIOR TO STATION OF CASES. THAT BC DC HAD SPENT THE PREVIOUS DECADE ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT MUCH SMALLER CASES WITH THIS MUCH SMALLER FINES AND THERE WAS VERY VERY LITTLE PARTICIPATION BY THE COMMISSIONERS ON ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE AS WELL AS. LOOKING AT LARGER TYPES OF CASES. SINCE THEN OF AS PART OF OUR TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STRATEGIC PLAN WE HAVE DEVELOPED A MUCH MORE DATA DRIVEN. ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH CONCENTRATES ON ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A POINT SYSTEM A TO TAKE A LOOK AT HARM TO THE BAY. HARM TO ACCESS TO THE BAY AS WELL AS TO THE SYSOON MARSH. AND THEREFORE WE HAVE MOVED TO LARGER SCALE CASES WITH COMPLIANCE POTENTIAL. BECAUSE THOSE LARGER CASES SIMPLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THE BAY OR DENY MORE OF THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE BAY. AND AS A RESULT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREASE OUR PRIORITIZATION ACTUALLY DEVELOP A STRATEGY WITH REGARD HOW TO DO ENFORCEMENT. AND DO SO WITH GUIDANCE FROM OUR COMMISSIONERS LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE BC DC COMMISSIONERS. THEY NINE OF THEM ARE COUNTY SUPERVISORS FOR OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM CITY COUNCIL AND OUT OF THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE IT BC DC THREE ARE THOSE LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM AROUND THE BAY. THEY HANDLE ENFORCEMENT CASES ALL THE TIME AS PART OF THEIR DAY JOB AS IT WERE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW ENFORCEMENT WORKS WITH REGARD TO PLANNING IN PERMITS. AND THEY HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL IN DIRECTING AND. AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE STAFF AS WE TAKE A LOOK AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PRIORITIZE AND HOW WE CAN MOVE ON. WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR WHICH WE ARE TREMENDOUSLY GRATEFUL AND WE'RE USING TOOLS WHICH YOU THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHICH WE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE. WITH REGARD TO HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY DO OUR ENFORCEMENT WORK. THE KEY HERE AND THIS IS WHERE ALL PROBABLY END BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AND AND WILL ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM. IS THAT THE CDC DOESN'T WANNA BE THE COP BEHIND THE BILLBOARD IN THE RURAL HIGHWAY WHO TRIES TO CATCH PEOPLE GOING SEVENTY MILES AN HOUR IN A SIXTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR ZONE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE LARGE SCALE PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES ALONG IT INSIDE THE BAY? AND WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THOSE PERMIT HOLDERS AND THAT'S THE THING THAT BC DC HAS HISTORICALLY DONE WE DON'T START A PROCESS BY SENDING A LETTER AND SAYING. NOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM INSTEAD WE HAVE SITE VISITS WE WORK PERMIT HOLDERS WHETHER THEY BE PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE PRIVATE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND WE TRIED TO GET AGREEMENTS BECAUSE CANDIDLY GETTING AN AGREEMENT IS AN AWFUL LOT QUICKER. AN AWFUL LOT MORE SATISFYING AND CANDIDLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM A WHOLE LOT EARLIER THAN HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE TO GAUGE SO THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO. THE THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS HOW BC DC CAN EXPAND THAT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE WOULD NEED AT BC DC IS A FULL TIME ATTORNEY WHO HANDLES ENFORCEMENT. INSTEAD OF OUR CHIEF COUNSEL WHO SPENDING EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIS TIME ON ENFORCEMENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF HIS TIME ON THE OTHER STUFF THAT I WANTED TO SPEND TIME. AS WELL AS A SENIOR LEVEL MANAGER WHO CAN MANAGE THOSE THREE PEOPLE INSURE THAT THE DIRECTION IS BEING FOLLOWED IT ACTUALLY HELPED DEVISE THAT STRATEGY. AND ALSO HELPED DEVISE A TRUE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. SO THE ISSUE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU AS IS THE REQUEST BY P. CDC TO ALLOW US TO USE FUNDS FROM THE BAY FILL. AND ABATEMENT FUND INTO WHICH FINDS ARE ACTUALLY DEPOSITED. TO PROVIDE A STABLE SOURCE FOR AT LEAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS FOR THOSE TWO POSITIONS AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE THAT IF WE. ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO HAVE LARGE ENFORCEMENT CASES WHICH ARE. HOPEFULLY NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS AND SETTLEMENTS THOSE FUNDS WILL ESSENTIALLY PAID BACK THE FUND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND AND WE WILL TIE THOSE TWO POSITIONS DIRECTLY TO THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT WHEN THOSE FUNDS IF THOSE FUNDS AND IF THAT FUND DOESN'T IS NO LONGER SOLVENT WE SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FUND THOSE TO. SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UP. SIMILAR. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER RIGHT CHAIRED THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR THE PRESENTATION I GUESS I HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE COP BEHIND THE BILLBOARD REFERENCE IN MY TALKING. HERE SINCE YOU'VE ACTUALLY. ACTIVELY ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BUT I AM A BIG FAN OF THE CDC AS A BAY AREA NATIVE. HAVING GROWN UP THERE THE BAY WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY WITHOUT THE FINAL WORK AT THE CDC IN THE STEWARDSHIP. ALL OF THE ORGANIZATION I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE HOLDING THIS ITEM. OPEN BECAUSE I JUST HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANISM HERE AND MAYBE WE WRITER. TALK OUR WAY THROUGH THAT SO. I WANT BE CDC TO CONTINUE ITS ITS CRITICAL MISSION OF OF REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT THE BUDGET REQUEST THOUGH. I THINK PUTS US ON OUR ON THE WRONG PATH AND I CAN BE SWAYED ON THIS BUT. THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS I HAVE THAT WERE ASKED TO APPROVE MORE STAFF FOR ENFORCEMENT. USING ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDS RIGHT SO. I NEED TO GET TO A COMFORT LEVEL WITH THAT AND I'M I'M NOT. THERE RIGHT NOW SO I THINK IT INCENTIVIZE IS MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF REPLENISHING OUR COFFERS A I THINK WE COULD SOMEHOW CRAFT A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS SO. THAT REQUEST COMES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COUPLE OF YEARS A PRETTY VISIBLE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AND FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER. ENFORCEMENT WAS IN A SURLY PRIORITY UNDER THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR NOW IT SEEMS TO BE RAMPING UP I THINK SOME LONG TIME STAKEHOLDERS. AROUND THE BAY FRONT. HAVE BEEN SHOCKED A LITTLE BIT AT THE NEW. ENFORCEMENT REGIME. I THERE A COUPLE OF ISSUES I THINK BETTER ARE SORT OF IN THE PROCESS OF BEING MEDIATED BEING WORKED THROUGH SO. I'M NOT GOING TO BE. COMMENTING ON ANYTHING SPECIFIC IN THAT REGARD IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE GAME PLAN GOING FORWARD NOW I LIKE THAT YOU ARE. PRIORITIZING. AND THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHT GOING INTO THIS. AND YOU KNOW I'M A PRETTY. ENVIRONMENTAL GUY I'VE PRETTY A VOTING RECORD IN THAT REGARD BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT. YOU KNOW IF IT FEELS ARBITRARY. IN ANY WAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE GIVING GOVERNMENT A BAD NAME IN THE BAY AREA. AND HAVE FOR BE WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT THAT I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS IS HOW FUNDS ARE INTERACTING WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND I'VE HEARD SOME TROUBLING STORIES SO. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY ON THE RIGHT. GENERAL PATH HERE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH SOME CONSISTENCY GOING FORWARD THAT. ON THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN SORT OF COUNT ON LIKE OF IT THIS IS HOW BE CDC OPERATES. BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT. THIS TO BE. AYE HEAVY HANDED KIND OF A SET UP WHERE YOU GOT IT FORSMAN BEING DONE REALLY TO KEEP. STAFFING THESE POSITIONS GOING FORWARD THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES GOING FOR WITH BAY LEVEL RISE. YOU FOLKS ARE GONNA HAVE. YOUR HANDS FULL AS WE ALL DEAL. WITH A GRAPPLING WITH THE CHANGING BAY LINE I IN THE BAY AREA SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME OTHER LARGER PRIORITIES. AND AND BC HE SEES ROLE REALLY IS GOING TO BEOME EVEN MORE CRITICAL THAT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. SO I DON'T WANT TO GET OFF TRACK IN THIS REGARD ON I JUST NEED TO GET TO A BETTER COMFORT LEVEL ABOUT HOW THE AGENCY IS AB APPROACHING. ENFORCEMENT AND REALLY WHAT THE BUDGET MECHANISM IT IS IN THAT REGARD SO. THERE SYNC ACCOUNT RECESSION WILL BE HAVING MY DISTRICT ALONG WITH SENATOR HEALTH. AND NOW SOME OF THE OTHER KEY PLAYERS THERE SAY LOOK FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND I THE COURT TO. WORKING WITH THE AGENCY TO SEE IF THERE'S MAYBE A BETTER WAY TO APPROACH THIS. I THINK A SMALL DITCH DID YOU WATER. SPARTAN ANYWAY. YEAH I I LEFT LIMIT RESPONSE SAYING I. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND TOTALLY SUPPORT. SAYING ESPECIALLY ABOUT CONSISTENT. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT A REGULATORY AGENCY CAN DO FOR THE PUBLIC IS DEMONSTRATE CONSIST. BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY. TELLS THE PUBLIC THAT THE EVERITT REGULATORY AGENCY UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. AN ACTUALLY HAS A PLAN TO DEAL WITH AND MAP PLAN CAN BE COUNTED ON IN FUTURE YEARS. AND. CANDIDLY WE HAVEN'T BEEN CONSISTENT AT THE SEE WITH REGARD TO HOW WE ENFORCE AND AND THAT'S FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF REASONS SO WE ARE MOVING TOWARD CONSISTENT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MOVE TOWARD A NEW KIND OF PROGRAMMER REINVIGORATE A PROGRAM IS THAT YOU UPSET THE EXISTING APPLE CART. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THAT WHICH IS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN BC DC IS SEEN AS. THERE ACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT ON A LARGE SCALE SO GETTING TO THAT POINT OF CONSISTENCY IS NOT EASY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A PRIORITIZATION. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU HAVE TO ALSO INTEGRATE THAT PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM WITH THOSE CASES WITH THE CASES YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING ON. AND YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MERGE THAT TOGETHER AND INTEGRATE IT SO THAT IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHAT BC DC IS DOING BECOMES EXPECTED. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT WHAT ABOUT BECOMING EXPECTED TO A SENSE OF CONSISTENCY IS THAT PROBABLY DOES MORE TO ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE WITH PERMITS. THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IF THE PUBLIC SECTOR PERMIT HOLDERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PERMIT HOLDERS RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND HOW BC DC APPROACHES ENFORCEMENT ON THOSE LARGE SCALE CASES. THEY HAVE A REASON TO LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT US AND SAY WE ARE DEFINITELY A COMPLIANCE AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW THAT OFF. A THINK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WE'RE WELL OUT OF ORDER BUT PART FINANCE. INTERRUPTED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEES. TOOK ACTION REDUCE REDUCE THEIR PREPARATION FOR THE. BAY FILL CLEAN UP ABATEMENT FUND. AT A HEARING. EARLIER APRIL THANK YOU LL BE EVERY TRAILERS OF LA NO NOT YET SO THERE THERE IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO THIS REQUEST BEFORE YOU THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY ACTED ON SO WITHOUT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL.
