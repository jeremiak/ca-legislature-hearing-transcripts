PRESENT YOUR TESTIMONY FIRST AND THEN GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE PANELISTS TESTIFIED THEN WE'LL TURN. TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING FORMER WHITE HOUSE SKIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. THE COMMITTEE IS GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE- DILIGENT WORK OF THE AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING THE CARPENTRY PROGRAM- OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DO IN IT. AMONG OTHER POSSIBLE. ACTIVITIES WAS TO COMPLETE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE- OUR RESEARCH SUPPORT ON. PROVIDING OVER OF THE MARKET AND THAT'S THE REPORT TO BE ISSUED IN JANUARY FOR TREES. FOR THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE AMERICAN PORT DISCUSSES OF FIVE CHAPTERS THE ADDRESSES OF SCOPING PLAN. THE ALLOWANCE BANK POTENTIAL MARKET REFORMS IF THEY WERE. NECESSARY ALL SUCH A MEDICATION MEASURES. THE SCOPING PLAN I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE OF THOSE AND- MY COMMITTEE CULT CULT COLLEAGUE DANI COLD WORD IS GOING TO PICK UP A COUPLE. AFTER ALL RIGHT I DO DESCRIPTION PLAN CHAPTER A KNOWLEDGE IS THE NEW FOCUS ON. AND THE PAINTING THE R. M. LONG TERM INITIALLY GOALS. FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE PUBLIC'S SCOPING PLAN PROCESS TODAY. WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE ALSO RAISED. THE NEED TO ADDRESS TWENTY THIRTY WITH MODELING AND ANALYSIS DESCRIBING THE WAY IT'S THOSE GOALS ARE GOING TO BE A CHEAP. WE UNDERSTAND NOW THAT THERE IS SUCH MOLLY IS IN THE WORKS AND SHE SHOULD BE IN. OUR COMING FOR JUNE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD APPLAUD BUT THERE'S A SECOND INTERESTED WE REALLY FOCUSED ON WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE INTERACTION OF THE COVERED MARKET WITH WITHIN THE SCOPING PROCESS ANOTHER REGULATIONS THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. TO ACHIEVE A MISS REDUCTION GOALS. WE JUST MADISON CARBON MARKET IS INDIFFERENT ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGES SECULAR CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY. YEAH THE REPORT IS ASKING FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY ATTENTION BALANCE AND STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS BETWEEN THE CORPORATE MARKET AND OTHER. REGULATORY EFFORTS. THE CHAPTER ON THE ALLOWANCE BANK CONSTRUCTED A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE IT WAS COINCIDENT WITH. THE BECOME THE FINAL RESULTS FOR THE THIRD COMPLIANCE PERIOD ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE A. R. B. FINAL ASSESSMENT OF THE SIZE OF THE BANK. WE FIND THAT THE SIZE THE BANK IS GREATER THAN AN ANNUAL ALLOCATION OF NEW COMMERCIAL OUTAGE IN ANY YEAR THIS DECADE IN THE PROGRAM. AND SO IT LOOKS PLAUSIBLE. THAT G. COMPLIANCE ENTITIES COULD SATISFY THE MARKET CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE COURT AND THE CREDIT MARKET WITH. NO FURTHER EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THE CURRENT LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE THE BANK THAT WE HELP TURN TOWARD. NOW IT IT IS NOT OUR WE DO NOT ACCOUNTANT AND INDEED FROM AN ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE ONE CANNOT IDENTIFY WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL SIZE THE BANK OR EVEN SAY CONCLUSIVELY WHAT THE BANK IS TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL. THE OPTICS OF THIS ARE CHALLENGING IN A SIMILAR SIZED BANK HAS EMERGED ANOTHER PROGRAMS IN REGGIE IN THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE WHICH INVOLVES. A LOT OF NORTHEAST STATES. AND YOU I. IMPORT AND CALL. ABOUT FOR WERE EMPTY THAT LED TO REDUCE IN THE PLAN THOSE THE IMPORTS LESS PROGRAMS ARE TREATING ABIS REDUCTIONS REGGIE REDUCE THE ISSUANCE OF NEW ALLOWANCES TO FULLY ABSORB THE PRIVATELY HELD BANK TWICE DURING ITS FIRST OF THE PLANNED SYSTEMATIC. PROGRAM REVIEWS. D. E. U. HAS IMPLEMENTED AN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM THAT IS EXPECTED TO CANCEL ROUGHLY ONE YEAR SUPPLICATION OF NEW ALLOWANCES. IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF BOTH THOSE HUSBAND TO BOOK SUPPORT THE LOWEST. PRICES ON THOSE PROGRAMS ANSWERS OF ALL OPTIONS THE STATE HOUSE IF IT DECIDES REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM CORPORATE SOURCES THROUGH A MARKET ADJUSTMENT. AND THIS IS WHERE OLD NUMBER ONE REQUIRES A LOT OF ATTENTION TO UNDERSTAND THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO- CONVEY. TO THE COMMITTEE. WE MENTIONED THE QUALITY ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS WERE IMPLEMENTED AND REGGIE ARE AN OPTION ANOTHER OPTION AND PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT. WOULD BE TO RAISE THE PRICE FLOOR BECAUSE OF POSSIBLY THAT COULD BE DONE. BY THE AGENCY AND THAT RAISING THE PRICE FOR CRUDE. COULD COULD CONSTRAIN THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ENTERING THE MARKET. HOWEVER STRONGER IDEA MAY BE TO IMPLEMENT AN ADDITIONAL PRICE STEP. WHICH WHICH IS THE AFFECTED REGGIE IMPLEMENT THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHICH IS WRITTEN INTO THE WASHINGTON STATE PROGRAM DESIGNED. THIS PRICE STEP THAT WHICH REGGIE CALLS AN EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT RESEARCH WOULD BE ABOVE THE PRICE FOR. WITH ITS OWN SUGAR PRICE APPLIED TO APPORTION SAY 10% OF THE ALLOWANCES THAT WOULD BE ISSUED AN AUCTION. BUT SO THE SHARE OF ALLOWANCES THAT THAT ENTER THE PROGRAM WOULD BE REDUCED AT A PRICE BELOW THIS PRICE STEP LEVEL. OF THIS CREATES A PRICE RESPONSIBLE PLIABLE LOUNGE WHICH IS ALREADY PARTIALLY AFFECTED CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRICE FOR YOU PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. OR THINK ABOUT EMISSION CAPS THEY OFTEN THINK THAT THERE'S A FIXED QUANTITY OF ALLOWANCES UNDER RIGHT TO ENTER MARKET BUT CALIFORNIA AND REGGIE THE NORTH AMERICAN CARBON MARKETS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE WELL PASSED OUT BOTTLED THROUGH TRUE SUPPLY ALLOWANCES. THE RESPONSE FOR THE PRICE OF THE MARKET AND THIS YOU KNOW RESEARCH WE ADVOCATE FOR THE ROLE OF CARBON MARKETS BECAUSE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS THAT THEY BRING IN ACHIEVING EMISSION REDUCTIONS BUT IN DESIGNING CAP AND TRADE MARKETS. THE TYPICAL APPROACHES THAT FOR JUST THE CAP OR NO OTHER COMMODITY MARKET IN THE WORLD IS LIKE THAT AND OTHER COMMODITY MARKETS THE SUPPLIER. OF THE GOOD RESPONSE TO THE PRICE OF ALLOWANCES THAT HELPS YOU PRAYED FOR PRICE OF. THE COMMODITY THAT HELPS WITH PRICE DISCOVERY HELPS CHEEK LIBERMAN THE MARKET AND IT CAN BE A REALLY USEFUL TOOL AND IT HELPS FOR THE CORPORATE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA TO INTRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT RESERVE. SO THAT IF THE PRICE FALLS L. AS THE PRICE FALLS THE END OF BECOMES CHEAPER TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT. FEWER EMOTIONAL OUT TO SOME OF THE MARKET. I'M THE FINAL END IN. THING WE HAVE. IS THE EMPLOYEE THAT PC OF ANY OF THESE OF MARKET IS. COULD HELP ON THE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FOR AS YOU KNOW BEEN VERY. FOR DRIVING INVESTMENTS IN MEMBERS COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. RESTRICTING THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCE WHICH COULD AFFECT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. IMPORTANT LESSON HERE IS THERE IS ACTION OPPORTUNITY. P. O. THE RESEARCH RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES TO ENTER THE MARKET WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE PRICE OF OIL CHANGE THE MARKET. AND THE OVERALL VALUE OF ALLOW ALLOWANCES THE MARKET WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE NOT DECREASE BY REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF OIL TO FOREIGN MARKETS SORT OF LIKE WHAT. HAPPENS IF A BENEFIT MONOPOLY TRIES TO CONTROL THE SUPPLY OF SOME GOOD INTRO MARKETS OVERALL REVENUES COULD INCREASE. THAT THIS MARKET DEPEND UPON THIS CASE OF. I CAN SPEAK PRETTY CONFIDENTLY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE THAT AND THE ASSET VALUE ALLOWANCES THE CAP ND TRADE MARKET. THE GLOBAL MARKET HOWEVER CURRENTLY ABOUT HALF OF THE ALLOWANCES THE MARKET ARE ISSUED FOR FREE. AND IF THE SUPPLY WAS REDUCED. STRICTLY BY REDUCING THE SALES. OWNED LAND TOOLS DONE THE VALUE OF FREELY DISTRIBUTED ALLOWANCES WOULD RISE SHARPLY. AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WOULD BE IMPOVERISHED. WE DESCRIBE AN APPROACH THAT WOULD PROTECT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. WHICH WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT SO THAT THE SUPPLY IF THE SUPPLIER RESTRICTED. OVERALL EACH CHANNEL SUPPLY ENTERING THE MARKET WOULD BE RESTRICTED PROPORTIONALLY. SO THAT'S A PRESENTATION OF THE IDEAS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M EAGER TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. MORE WALKABLE FAVOR QUESTIONS I KNOW. I WOULDN'T SAY I ENJOYED READING THE FORTY TWO PAGE REPORT BY IRAQ OR IS RATHER THICK BUT- I DIDN'T WORK MY WAY THROUGH IT. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM- THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR ON POLICY- BUT THE I MAC AT DR DANI COLIN WARD. PROFESSOR POINT GOOD MORNING SENATOR WHAT KASKY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE LET ME ECHO BOTH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIVES OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STRENGTHENING THIS PROGRAM AND KEEPING IT A VIBRANT AND SUCCESSFUL PART. OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO I THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGES WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT PLEASE HEAR THE CRITICISMS THAT I'M GOING TO EXPRESS TODAY IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO MAKE THESE THINGS BETTER AND STRONGER AS OPPOSED TO THE ELIMINATE THEM. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE DALLAS'S REMARKS ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE NOW HAVE BEFORE US WITH I THINK SUBSTANTIAL NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS INSIGHTS FROM OTHER PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE CONFRONTED SIMILAR CHALLENGES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE ISSUES TODAY IN MY OPENING REMARKS- I WILL PICK UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE SCOPE AND PLAN SHOPPED AT THE DALLAS TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS THE ALLOWANCE BANKING CHAPTER AND I'LL CLOSE MY REMARKS BY TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF CARBON OFFSETS WHICH PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT PART IN THE LARGE A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO TO START WITH- I WANT TO ECHO I THINK POLICY MAKERS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THREE GOALS ONLY TWO OF WHICH I THINK CAN BE PRESENT AT ANY GIVEN TIME. ONE IS TO HAVE A LARGE ROLE FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THE SECOND IS THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE ALLOWANCE BANKER RELATIVELY LOW MARKET PRICES AND THE THIRD IS A PLAN THAT CAN GET US TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY CALL. IT IS POSSIBLE IN MY OPINION TO GET TWO OF OUT OF THESE THREE BUT NOT ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME AND I THINK WE HAVE PRETTY CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE A VERY LARGE ALLOWANCE BANK AND THAT THREATENS THE ABILITY OF A STRATEGY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON THIS PROGRAM TO GET TO THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. POLICYMAKERS HAVE IMPORTANT CHOICES AS TO THE SIZE AND ROLE OF THE PROGRAM IN AN OVERALL SCOPE OF THE PLAN PROCESS AND THOSE POLICY CHOICES NEED TO CONFRONT A SERIES OF TRADEOFFS WHICH I KNOW ARE FAMILIAR TO THE LEADERSHIP IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE. SO JUST FOCUS. ON THIS ISSUE FOR A SECOND BECAUSE I THINK. BALANCING THE ROLE THAT AND TRADE. IS A- PART. QUESTIONS AND IF THE STATE WISHES TO MAINTAIN A PLANNED ROLE FOR CAP AND TRADE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN CAP AND TRADE IS THE SINGLE LARGEST DRIVER. OF OUR STRATEGY TO GET TO TWENTY THIRTY IT WAS- REPRESENTING ABOUT 38% OF THE CUMULATIVE REDUCTIONS OVER THIS DECADE. NEARLY HALF OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT CARB EXTRACTED AND THAT PLANNING PROCESS TO BE ACHIEVED BY TWENTY THIRTY. TO CHOOSE SOMETHING SIMILAR I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM- AND IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IF ANY IT'S GOINGTO BE IMPORTANT IN THE SCOPE AND PLANNING PROCESS. THE CARD IS CURRENTLY UNDER UNDERTAKING. TO QUANTITATIVELY PROJECT WHERE CARB THING SUBMISSIONS IS GOING TO BE. AND TO IDENTIFY A ROLE FOR THE PROGRAM IN CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S SUCCESSFUL AND AMBITIOUS CLIMATE POLICIES. AND ITS CLIMATE TARGETS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY- THE SCOPING PLAN CHAPTER IN THE I. IMAC REPORT- DISCUSSES HOW. THE MODELING WORK TODAY IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I UNDERSTAND AND I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM THE NEXT PANELISTS THAT. NEW MODELING WORK IS EXPECTED SOON THAT MAY ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS. THE ECHO DALLAS'S COMMENTS THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD BE VERY WELCOME AND I THINK WE PROVIDE A CONSTRUCTIVE BASIS FOR FIGURING OUT WHERE WE NEED TO CALL. WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLOWANCE BANKING CHAPTER I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE OF ISSUES- BEFORE MOVING ON TO OFFSETS- THE CHAPTER OBSERVES USING CARBS DATA THAT THE ALLOWANCE BANK IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION ALLOWANCES. THAT'S A VERY TECHNICAL NUMBER BUT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT. IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE SCENARIO THE CARD CONSIDERED IN ITS TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULEMAKING IMPLEMENTING AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. AND IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS CARB IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY COMING FROM THE ENTIRE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OVER THIS DECADE. IN ITS PREVIOUS COUPLE PLANNED PROCESS SO. DALLAS IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO SAY THERE'S NO. MAGIC NUMBER OR TARGET WE SHOULD BE AIMING FOR BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME PRETTY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT. THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE EXPECTED- I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS AS- SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU'LL NO. DOUBT RECALL IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS. WERE VERY FOLKS INCLUDING MY- AND ALL. WHO RAY CONCERN ABOUT THE- BACK FOR FIVE YEARS AGO- SOME FOLKS MADE QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS AND THEY THE ALLOWANCE BANKING CHAPTER TRACKS THE OUTCOMES RELATIVE TO THOSE PREDICTIONS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PEOPLE WHO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE ALLOWANCE BANK. MADE PREDICTIONS THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED. AND WHAT WAS OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN PAST REGULATORY PLANNING DOCUMENTS IDENTIFIED AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF THIS IS TO IDENTIFY THE NEED. FOR A NEW DISCUSSION. RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF COUNT POINTS IN THE PAST. BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IF CAP AND TRADE IS GOING TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN OUR PATH TO TWENTY THIRTY. THE LAST TOPIC I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE CARBON OFFSETS PROGRAM- THIS IS ALSO A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TPIC- AND I THINK A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT- THE ALSO THE PROGRAM IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A SMALL PART OF THE CAPITATE PROGRAM. BUT THAT IS NOT IN FACT TRUE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION FOREST CARBON OFFSETS- WERE AT THEIR BOSS SETS WERE USED IN THE- COMPLIANCE PERIOD FOR THE FIRST. THREE COMPLIANCE PERIODS- AND- THAT IS IT IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER ACROSS BOTH CALIFORNIA AND QUEBEC. ABOUT 80% OF THOSE OFFSETS COME FROM THE FOREST CARBON OFFSETS PROGRAM. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT A LARGE ALLOWANCE BANK AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION ALLOWANCES AND OFFSET USE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION ALLOWANCES. I HOPE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ABILITY THE ABILITY OF COMPLIANCE ENTITIES OF THE PROGRAM. TO RELY ON. OFFSETS AND SAVE OR NOT USE ALLOWANCES IN RETURN. IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE SORT OF MACRO CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVING WHAT THE PROGRAM MAY HAVE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS. INSTRUMENTS AT AT AT PRESENT. I WANT TO DISCUSS THREE PER. THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CHAPTER- WHICH BOTH ADDRESSES THESE TECHNICAL CONCERNS WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FOREST OFFSETS PROGRAM. THAT MAKES A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS POLICYMAKERS COULD CONSIDER TO MAKE BIG PICTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM IF THEY AGREE WITH THESE CONCERNS. THE THREE PROBLEMS ARE THE FACT THAT THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME PROJECTS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CLAIMING CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL ACTIVITIES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PRECISELY IDENTIFY WHICHAND HOW MANY BECAUSE- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS TAKING CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL IS HARD TO DETERMINE DEFINITIVELY. BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT REPORTING THAT SUGGESTS LARGE PROJECTS IN THE SYSTEM MAY IN FACT BE DOING THIS. THERE IS DOCUMENTED PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE FROM A STUDY THAT I PARTICIPATED IN THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT. ABOUT HOW PERHAPS AS MANY AS ONE OUT OF THREE OF THE CREDITS ISSUED TO THE FOREST OFFSET PROJECTS DO NOT REFLECT REAL CLIMATE BENEFITS. AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESSES IN THE PROGRAM RULES THAT- PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM ARE FINANCIALLY ARBITRAGE. AND THE REPORT ALSO DISCUSSES A NUMBER OF CONCERNS RELATED TO THE PERMANENCE OF CARBON CLAIMS BEING MADE BEFORE THE FOREST OFFSETS. ALL CALIFORNIANS KNOW THE WILDFIRES WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN RECORD BREAKING. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE FIRES ALSO HIT QUITE A FEW LARGE OFFSET PROJECTS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT PERHAPS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF THE SHIFT. OF THE STATE'S INSURANCE PROGRAM OR ITS SO CALLED BUFFER POOL FOR PROTECTING THE PERMANENCE OF THESE FORESTS CARBON CLAIMS. MAY HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE FIRES AND I THINK IT RAISES SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROGRAM IS PREPARED TO MAKE THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED. TO MAKE A FOREST CARBON CLAIM RESEMBLE ANYTHING RESEMBLING THE ON GOING COMMISSIONS. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY AND I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THIS IS THAT. MY COLLEAGUES AND I WHO WORKED ON ONE OF THESE CRITICAL STUDIES PUT OUT OUR WORK IN PUBLIC ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO WE- SHARED OPENLY WITH DATA AND METHODS. THAT WERE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WE WORKED WITH PULITZER PRIZE WINNING REPORTER. WHO HELPED REPORT ON THE STORY WHO SHARED THE STUDY WITH CARBON OFFSET DEVELOPERS INTERESTED PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. TEN MONTHS LATER WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF SUBSTANTIVE CRITIQUES FROM FOLKS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE STUDY- IT HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND HAS BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND I JUST WANT TO FLAG. THE PRIMARY RESPONSE I'VE RECEIVED FROM CARB STAFF. HAS BEEN TO BE HONEST AD HOMINEM AND FALSE ATTACKS ABOUT THE CLAIM THAT I FALSELY PARTICIPATED IN LITIGATION AGAINST THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THIS CRITICISM HAS BEEN REPEATED AGAINST ME AND MY CO AUTHORS IT IS A FALSE CRITICISM- AND IT'S REALLY DISTURBING TO ME AS SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED ON THESE ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS THAT. WHEN WE HAVE SUCH TECHNICALLY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS THAT WE GET INTO BASICALLY MUD SLINGING THAT IS EXTREMELY AD HOMINEM AND I THINK DEEPLY INAPPROPRIATE. SO I WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THOSE ISSUES IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO GO- AND I HOPE YOU ALL HEAR MY CONCERNS TODAY IS BEING. ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM BETTER AND HELPS THE STATE ACHIEVE. A REALLY SIGNIFICANT AN AMBITIOUS GOAL THAT WE NEED TO LEAD. IF WE'RE GOING TO. HOW GET THIS JOB DONE AND MAKE THE FUTURE BETTER FOR ALL OF US SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN OUR THANK YOU FOR THE- THE BRIEFING FROM THE IMAX CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR LET'S TURN TO THE ADMINISTRATION. OUR FIRST PANELISTS WILL BE SECRETARY- JR BLOOM FELL- WITH THE CALIFORNIA- ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY SECRETARY GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING HMO CASKEY AND MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING- AS YOU MAY KNOW AND MENTIONED THAT KELLY P. A.'S THE CAN BE NOT THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE A MOUTHFUL. AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT CAP AND TRADE. AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE I. E. MAX TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECALL THANKS ALSO- TO THE IP MAC MEMBERS SO THEY'RE IMPORTANT WHETHER THEY DO TO EVALUATE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I'VE REALLY IMPORTANT VOICES IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AND WE VALUE THE TIME THAT THEY DEDICATE TO THIS COMMITTEE- REALLY WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK DALLAS- AND THEN EIGHT THIS MORNING AND I'M SORRY THAT. THIS KIND OF THINGS ARE UGLY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME INTO THESE COMMITTEES AND THAT TASK BUT THEY REALLY THEY REALLY DO ADD TO THAT THE PUBLIC DIALOGUE. ON ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE CAP AND TRADE- AND I WANT TO STOP BY FOLLOWING UP ON THE LETTER THAT I SENT TO YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GAVE WAY BACK. IN THE DARK AGES OF TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE OF IT IT'S LIKE DIFFERENT- THAT WAS RELATED CAPITAL TRADE. WE TOOK. VERY SERIOUSLY THE COMES. AT THAT. AND IMPLEMENT THE STEPS OUTLINED IN THAT LETTER. THE FASTER THOSE STEPS IS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH COBB ON THE BET ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCOPING PLAN IN THIS EFFORT TO SET CALIFORNIA ON THE PASS THROUGH THIS CODING PLAN TO ACHIEVING OUT TWENTY THIRTY. AND ACABA NEUTRALITY TARGETS AND AS CHAIR AT RANDOLPH WILL DESCRIBE. COPS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE MODELING FOR THE SCENARIOS THAT WILL SHOW HOW WE'RE DOING IT CHEATING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THE- DALLAS AND DANNY MENTIONED. AND HOW WAS SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED THE CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGETS. THIS MODELING WILL BE. AVAILABLE MID MAP IN MID MARCH OF THIS YEAR I'M SORRY JUST OVER A MONTH FROM NOW- AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODELS AND SCENARIOS. HAS INVOLVED HAS INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT STAKEHOLDER INPUT INCLUDING COMPACT LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE I. E. MAC AND IMPLANTS AND THEY DECIDED TO. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. BASED ON THIS TWENTY THIRTY MODELING AND THE RESULTING- THE RESULTING SCENARIOS COULD SHOWS. THAT SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS NEED TO BE TIGHTENED IN ORDER TO HAVE A LONGER TIME TARGETS. THE SIGNAL FROM THE SCOPING PLAN WILL KICK OFF THE NEXT STEP. WHICH WOULD BE REVISIONS TO OUR REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAP AND TRADE LOWCOCK FUEL STANDARD AND THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD TO NAME JUST A FEW. INSTANT FOR SKIPPING PLAN MAY SHOW THAT AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL REDUCTIONS THE CAP CAP AND TRADE DOES NOT NEED TO PLAY SUCH A MAJOR ROLE IN OUR TOOL BOX GOING FULL. THE STRINGENCY OF REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE THAT LAST CABIN PLANT AS WELL AS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS ON INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE LAST BUDGET. AS WELL AS THOSE PROPOSING THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUDGET. WILL GO A LONG WAY IN DRIVING EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE VERY INDUSTRIES THAT CAP AND TRADE KAPPA. ANY POTENTIAL REVISIONS THE CAP AND TRADE OR OTHER REGULATIONS WOULD THEN TAKE PLACE IN THE CONTEXT OF A MULTI STAKEHOLDER ROBUST RULEMAKING PROCESS. AS J. RANDALL WILL DESCRIBE. THESE RULE MAKING PROCESS SEES GENERALLY TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR IN PART TO ENSURE ALL RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. IN ORDER FOR THE PUBLIC EIGHT KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO TRUST OUR REGULAR ENTRY PROCESS SEES. IT'S ESSENTIAL WE FOLLOWED THE STEP WISE APPROACH. VERY IMPORTANTLY ANY CHANGES WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND WHEN IT COMES TO CAP AND TRADE OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM CODE INSIDE BY LEGISLATION. WE SEE OUR ROLE IS IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM BASED ON STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT LAYS OUT MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF CAP AND TRADE AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE REQUIREMENTS TWENTY LETTER TO CHAT WHY CASKEY THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY AREAS BRAND NEW LEGISLATION COULD FURTHER THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE STRATEGY. I HOPE WE CAN ENGAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS ONCE WE HAVE A SENSE THROUGH THE SCOPING PLAN OF AREAS WHERE LEGISLATION WILL BE THE MOST NEED IT. J. ROUNDUP WILL GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE IRON MASK FOR PAUL LET ME BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF TOPICS. AS WE HAD FROM THE PREVIOUS BECAUSE THE I. IMAC TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS ON THE SCOPING PLAN ALLOWANCE BANKING ADMISSIONS MARKET DESIGN AND PROGRAM REFORM. CARBON OFFSETS AND EMISSION LEAKAGE MIDDAY AND MITIGATION MEASURES THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING AND I SHOULD I CAN ASSURE THE EMAIL MEMBERS AND THE SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE THEY WERE CAREFULLY CONSIDERING EACH OF THEM WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DELIVERY. PROCESS I DESCRIBED EARLIER. I REALLY SPOKE ABOUT THE SKILL BEING PLANNED SO LET'S BRIEFLY DISCUSS UNUSED ALLOWANCES AND LEAKAGE. ON UNUSED ALLOWANCES WE AGREE WITH THE I AM BACK THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE SAID THE STUDY. IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY UNUSED ALLOWANCES ARE APPROPRIATE AND ACCEPTABLE. THIS IS HOW MANY WOULD BE TOO MANY. WHAT I SUGGEST IS COPPER BACK THE LEFT OF. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. DURING THE STATE OF THE- FOR AND IT NEST. SHOULD YOUR LEADS LET JUST CHANGES TO INITIAL THE NUMBER OF ALLOW. IN THE SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE. WHICH SUGGESTS THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE BECAUSE BY THE END OF. THE FINALIZES COPING PLAN WE'LL HAVE MORE DATA UNDER THE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT DESIGN PROGRAM. AND WILL HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WORKSHOPS ON THE TOPIC BEFORE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND HE BRIEFLY TO ON THE ISSUE OF LEAKAGE THIS IS WHY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND ASSOCIATED EMISSIONS SHIFT FROM CALIFORNIA TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS JURISDICTIONS WHERE EMISSIONS. ARE REGULATED LESS STRINGENTLY ALL NOT AT ALL. WHAT'S DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAKAGE IN THE SYSTEM. A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DOES HAVE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE TO PREVENT LEAKAGE. WE ALSO WORK VERY HARD TO EXPLORE I. GHG REGULATIONS OF THE JURISDICTIONS. IN AN EFFORT TO DE INCENTIVIZE LEAKAGE. WE UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERN ABOUT THIS ISSUE. EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT RSS DURABLE AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ABOUT LEAKAGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CAP AND TRADE IN THIS REPORT. WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE NECESSARY STATUTORY CHANGES TO THE-PROGRAM. GEORGIE'S LEAKAGE INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR A BORDER CARBON ADJUSTMENT. KABUL BEGIN THE PROCESS TO DESIGN A STUDY TO ASSESS LEAKAGE IN ADVANCE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE RECALL DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE. THIS STUDY WILL FOCUS ON THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES WITH THE GOAL OF A RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION AS SUGGESTED IN THE EMAIL REPORT TO DETERMINE ITS LEAKAGE MAY HAVE A CAT. THIS WILL INFORM ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE REGULATORY CHANGES TO MITIGATE THE RISK. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL FOCUS WE PLACE ON ENSURING THE PROGRAMS BEING DISCUSSED HERE TODAY HAVE THE GREATEST POSITIVE BENEFITS IN COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM POLLUTION BUT- THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT WE HAVE JUST RELEASED A REPORT THAT SHOWS CRITERIA POLLUTANTS HAVE GONE DOWN AROUND FACILITIES SUBJECT TO CAP AND TRADE. AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SEEN THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE RESULT OF CAP AND TRADE LETTER. INSTEAD THE PRODUCT OF A SWEET REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES AIMED AT REDUCING GHG ME. WORK MY MISSIONS AND ADD TOXINS. I WANT TO CLOSE BY AGAIN THANKING THE IP MAC MEMBERS OF EVERY THORA ANSEL RIPPLE. WE CLEARLY ALIGN THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE TO BRING US TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDING REMARKS TODAY AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM SHARE RANDOLPH AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU CHAD WHY CASKEY. THANK YOU SECRETARY AND LET'S MOVE TO A- A CHAIR RANDALL WHO INHERITED THIS SMALL PROGRAM- GOOD MORNING AS THE CHAIR OF THE- CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES. BOARD- PLEASE GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT KIMORA. I AM. GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN- WITH A GRIEF- AT. RSS AROUND THE SKIPPING CLAN AND WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY- IS- ABLE TO KIND OF FOLLOW ALONG AND SEE WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING SO FIRST LET ME THANK YOU FOR. CONVENING THIS DISCUSSION AS US SECRETARY BLUMENFELD MENTIONED AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO- THAT DISCUSSION THIS MORNING. OKAY AND I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADVANCE MY SLIDE THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT- THE FIRST TIME IN A TALK ABOUT THE GREATER CONTEXT FOR THAT I AM MAX RECOMMENDATIONS- IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL CLIMATE PROGRAM WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS ALREADY THIS MORNING- THEY COME IN THE CONTEXT OF- AT THE PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. I HAVE A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SINCE AB THIRTY TWO WAS SIGNED AND SINCE WE STARTED THE SCOPING PLANNING PROCESS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING EMISSIONS PER CAPITA GDP AND IN TOTAL WHILE THE ECONOMY. AND POPULATION CONTINUED TO GROW. HI CHART SHOWS WHICH SECTORS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO OUR GHG EMISSIONS IN THE AB THIRTY TWO GHG INVENTORY. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS RELATED TO OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION AND REFINING WHICH PUTS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AT ABOUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE IMAX RECOMMENDATIONS FALL IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA'S MULTI LAYERED CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK AND SECRETARY BLUMENFELD TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER. ALL OF OUR CLIMATE POLICY FOLLOWS FROM STATE LEGISLATION AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT GIVE CARBON OTHER STATE AGENCIES THE AUTHORITY AND DIRECTION TO ENACT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REGULATIONS. AS WELL AS DEFINED OUR CLIMATE POLICY WHERE SPECIFIC EFFORT- DIRECTION IS NEEDED. A. B. THIRTY TWO REQUIRES CARD TO UPDATE IN A DOCTOR'S COPING PLAN EVERY FIVE YEARS THAT LAYS OUT HOW THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE ITS GHG REDUCTION GOALS. IT IS AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO IDENTIFY OUTCOMES AND ACTIONS FOR ECONOMY WIDE DECARBONISATION. THE SCOPING PLAN DOES NOT RECOMMEND SPECIFIC REGULATIONS MORE IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIC CHANGES TO EXISTING REGULATIONS. IT'S AFTER FINALIZING THIS CABIN PLAN THAT CARP AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES ADOPTED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE AND CLAN THIS INCLUDES THINGS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN AND LONG TERM PROCUREMENT PLAN WHICH IMPLEMENTS SP THIRTY THREE FIFTY- AND WHICH I WORKED ON QUITE A BIT IN MY PREVIOUS ROLE. THE IMS RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GENERALLY AT THIS LEVEL OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT. AND ARE ABOUT A SPECIFIC REGULATION. CAP AND TRADE. WELL I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERY BULLET ON THE SLIDE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS- A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS THAT CARBON AT THEIR AGENCIES FOLLOW WHEN WE DEVELOP REGULATIONS. WE ARE WORK IS GOVERNED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT WHICH PROVIDES THE PUBLIC WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND INCREASE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT FORMAL NOTICE SAYS REGULATORY TAXED. AND SOME REGULATORY ACTIONS ALSO REQUIRE AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT OR SYRIA. WHICH IS REQUIRED WHEN AN AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT A PROPOSED REGULATION HAS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT EXCEEDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN CONSIDERING CHANGES TO CAP AND TRADE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED CAR TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION. SEVERAL STEPS IN THIS PROCESS REQUIRE US TO ASSESS ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED ACTIONS AND TO ASSESS BOTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THOSE AUTHENTICATES. SO I'M NOW INTERESTED IRAQ'S MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR MOST RECENT REPORT. THEIR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE SCOPING PLAN SHOULD EXAMINE PROGRESS TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGET. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER WE AGREE AT THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN UPDATE WILL ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARDS THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO STAY ON TRACK AND LAY OUT A PATH TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCOPING PLAN HAS A LONGER PLANNING HORIZON THAN PREVIOUS SCOPING PLAN. WHICH BEST FITS A GREATER FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES NEEDED TO ACHIEVE GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. THE PLAN WILL FOCUS ON OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGIES FUELS ENERGY SOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS BY MID CENTURY. THE RESULTS OF SCENARIO MODELING WILL ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THIS COPING PLAN PROVIDES AN ECONOMY WIDE FRAMEWORK SPANNING MANY YEARS AND THEREFORE AS NOTED EARLIER DOES NOT DELVE INTO THE DESIGN DETAILS OF THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS OR REGULATIONS. NOR DOES IT SUPPLANT OR CREATE NEW STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. THOSE ACTIVITIES WILL OCCUR SEPARATELY. THIS WILL ANALYZE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET ISSUE A BANK ALLOWANCES IN OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULEMAKING. AND IS ALSO PREPARING A REPORT- BOARD RESOLUTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF BANK ALLOWANCES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE HINDERING PROGRESS TOWARDS- TWENTY THIRTY CALLS. SOME ACTORS SOME ECONOMISTS HAVE STUDIED WHO HAVE STUDIED THE PROGRAM HAD HAVE ADVISED THAT ARTIFICIALLY REMOVING UNUSED ALLOWANCES NOW. COULD ONLY SERVE TO INCREASE PRICES IN THE PROGRAM WITHOUT CLEAR CORRESPONDING EMISSIONS REDUCTION BENEFITS. HOWEVER AS AS THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE DISCUSSED WE MUST CONSIDER ANY NUMBER OF THINGS ALLOWANCES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPLETE PROGRAM. END DATE AND THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE STRENGTHEN THE SELF RATCHETING MECHANISM SO THAT ALLOWANCES AND SOLD FOR EIGHT AUCTIONS WOULD BE REMOVED INTO THE ALLOW ITS PRICE CONTAINMENT RESERVE. THROUGH THIS MECHANISM MORE THAN THIRTY SEVEN MILLION ALLOWANCES WERE ALREADY MOVED INTO THE RESEARCH ALLOWANCE BUDGETS 421-202-1220 THIRTY WE REFLECTED THE FACT THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED A TWENTY TWENTY TARGET EARLY BY REMOVING ALLOWANCES FROM GENERAL CIRCULATION AND PLACING THEM IN RESEARCH. ALSO AMENDED THE REGULATION TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE ALLOWANCES FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES TO THE ASSET USAGE LIMIT ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. I'M GONNA BRIEFLY TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT. THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT WE WILL MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM WHEN NECESSARY INCLUDING REMOVING ALLOWANCES FROM THE GENERAL POOL TO BETTER ALIGN WITH PROGRAM PERFORMANCE. BASED ON. CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND A REGULATORY PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY STATUTE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE MUST NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS CHANGED A LOT AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MOST OF THOSE CHANGES WERE MANDATED BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. AS PART OF THE PROGRAM GOING OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY WE SET OUR CATS TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ESTABLISHED BY SP THIRTY TWO IS STEEPER THAN THE TWENTY TWENTY GOAL. AS A RESULT THE CAT SMITH FROM ABOUT 2% PER YEAR FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. TWO ABOUT 4% PER YEAR FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REQUIRED US TO SET A PRICE CEILING STARTING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THAT IS NOW SET AT SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINE CENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH LIKE THE PRICE FLOOR GOES UP BY 5% PLUS INFLATION EVERY YEAR. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRED US TO REDESIGN THE ALLOWANCE PRICE CONTAINMENT RESERVE WHICH SERVES AS AN IMPORTANT COST CONTAINMENT OF THE PROGRAM. TO HAVE TWO TIERS. THESE TEARS ARE PARKED AT THE 50% AND 75% MARK BETWEEN THE PRICE FLOOR AND THE PRICE CEILING WHICH THIS YEAR ARE AT FORTY SIX DOLLARS AND FIVE CENTS AND FIFTY NINE DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN CENTS RESPECTIVELY. AND AGAIN THESE ALSO GO UP 5% PLUS INFLATION. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRED A 1100% LEAKAGE ASSISTANCE FACTOR TO BE APPLIED TO ALL INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. AND LASTLY AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS THAT REGULATED ENTITIES CAN USE FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY. FROM 8% 24% AND A HALF THAT 4% MUST PROVIDE DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FROM THE FIRST THREE COMPLIANCE PERIODS OF THE PROGRAM. BOASTS BOTH IN TERMS OF BEING MORE STRINGENT BUT ALSO MAKE CHANGES TO CONTAIN PRICES AND AVOID MAKING. AND IMPORTANTLY WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES WILL BE ON THE LINE. I AM NOT A REPORT ALSO INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS ON ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT SUPPLY IN RESPONSE TO ACTUALLY HELP COMES. EFFECTIVELY ENHANCING THE MARKET'S PRICE FLOOR BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT RESERVE PRICE STEP. AS EXISTS IN OTHER NORTH AMERICAN EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS AS DALLAS DESCRIBED EARLIER. AS I JUST DESCRIBED ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE THE LEGISLATURE WAITING THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT ON THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. AND MANY OF THOSE CHANGES INCLUDING REINFORCING THE REGULATORY MECHANISM FOR REMOVING ALLOWANCES WHEN THERE IS LOW DEMAND AT AUCTION. AND ESTABLISHING THE TWO NEW PRICE CONTAINMENT RESERVE TEARS AND CRIES FEELING TOOK A BACK TOOK EFFECT FULLY LAST YEAR. AND WE HAVE LIMITED DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THOSE CHANGES. AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND ADJUST AS NEEDED. THE PROGRAM HAS SUPPORTED A STEADILY INCREASING PRICING NOW AS NOTED ON THE SLIDE. WHICH HAS SEEN PERIODS OF BOTH LOW AND HIGH DEMAND INCLUDING A SCENE IN RECENT AUCTIONS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE MUST ALWAYS CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY METRICS TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM. FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THOSE METRICS MUST INCLUDE REVEALING HOW EMISSIONS AND CRISIS FOR ALLOWANCES ARE CHANGING OVER TIME. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ASSETS AS I NOTED A B. THIRTY THREE NINETY EIGHT CUT THE ASSET LIMIT IN HALF 24% IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS. AND THAT WILL ADJUST 26% WE HAVE CONDUCTED PERIODIC REVIEWS OF OUR OFFSET PROTOCOLS AND UPDATED THEM BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE THE ACADEMIC CONCERNS RELATED TO FOREST ASSET PROTOCOL AND AS USUAL WE ARE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING YOU DATED THAT MAY WARRANT TECHNICAL UPDATES IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I DIRECTED CARDS STAFF TO START HOLDING WORKSHOPS THIS SUMMER TO EVALUATE THE LATEST SCIENCE FOR ANY POTENTIAL PROGRAM UPDATE. AND TO DISCUSS THE CONCERNS RAISED ON THE FOREST OFFSET PROTOCOL. ONE THING I WANT TO TOUCH ON BEFORE WE MOVE ON IT IS THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON FORESTS ASSET PROJECTS. THIS IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS ISSUE AS CLIMATE CHANGE EXACERBATES OUR WILDFIRE PROBLEM. WE FORESAW THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT WE CALL OUR FIRST CELLS DUE TO WILDFIRE AND OTHER DISTURBANCES SUCH AS PEST INFESTATION WHEN THE OFFSET PROGRAM IS DESIGNED. TO FORCE OFFSET PROTOCOL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THESE RISK FACTORS BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA FROM WHEN THE PROTOCOL WAS ADOPTED AND LATER AMENDED. BASED ON THE RISK FACTORS A PROJECT SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CREDIT SATISFIED INTO THE FOREST BUFFER ACCOUNT WHICH SERVES AS AN INSURANCE MECHANISM TO ENSURE PERMANENT. TYPICALLY EACH PROJECT THAT IS ISSUED CARBON OFFSET CREDITS CONTRIBUTES BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND 19% OF THEIR TOTAL CREDIT INTO THE BUFFER ACCOUNT. IN THE EVENT OF A WILDFIRE DESTROYING PART OF A PROJECT WE ESTIMATE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS LAST AND REQUIRE ANY SORRY RETIRE AND EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF ASSETS FROM THE BUFFER POOL TO MAINTAINING ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM. SINCE OUR PROTOCOL APPLIES TO PROJECTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF FOREST TYPES AND LOCATIONS CONTRIBUTING TO THE BUFFER POOL. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MILLION CREDITS HAVE BEEN A TRICK CONTRIBUTED TO THE PARK FOREST BUFFER POOL TO DATE WITH EACH NEW PROJECT CONTINUING TO CONTRIBUTE. APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE MILLION CREDITS OR LESS THAN 4% HAVE BEEN RETIRED FROM THE FORCE AFTER ACCOUNT TO DATE TO ACCOUNT FOR INVOLUNTARY REVERSALS. THIS MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT PROJECTS DO NOT FACE REVERSAL EVENTS THE PROGRAM ACHIEVES MORE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THE ASSETS PRODUCE. AS I NOTED WE WILL BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LATEST SCIENCE AS PART OF THE STAFF WORKSHOPS THAT WILL BE CONVENED LATER THIS SUMMER INCLUDING A DISCUSSION. OF WILDFIRE RISKS. FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE KIDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT MANDATES THE LEAKAGE ASSISTANCE FACTOR FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD. AND CARBS OUTPUT BASED ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR INDUSTRY IS BASED ON ACTUAL UPDATING DATA. CARB HAS IDENTIFIED LEAKAGE IN THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND WE DO RETIRE ALLOWANCES RELATED TO EM OUTSTANDING EMISSIONS TO ADDRESS THIS LEAKAGE. I'LL NOTE THAT CAR WAS FULLY ENGAGED WITH OTHER STATES AND STATE AGENCIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND DEEP IN WESTERN ELECTRICITY MARKETS WHILE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ACCURATE GHG ACCOUNTING AND OUR DRESSING LEAKAGE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRES US TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ON THE LAKE IS PROPOSED BY. OKAY I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE LAST FEW SLIDES FAIRLY QUICKLY- JUST TO NOTE THAT- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AS DISCUSSED EARLIER OF UPDATING THE SCOPING PLAN- IT WILL LAY OUT THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF OUR CLIMATE REGULATIONS INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE. WILL BE ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT TWENTY THIRTY IS A MILESTONE ON. WHERE RECENT SCIENCE SAYS WE NEED TO BE BY MID CENTURY SO WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWO THIRTY ONE TO START PLANNING FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF TRANSFORMATION IS NEEDED NEEDED ACROSS THE ECONOMY IS UNPRECEDENTED. SO WE NEED TO LOOK FOR ACTIONS TO DEPLOY CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY TO HIT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND PUT US ON A PATH TOWARD DECARBONIZING. TOWARD A NEUTRALITY IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE ANNOUNCED. THIS COPING PLAN WILL HAVE THE LONGEST PLANNING HORIZON OF ANY PREVIOUS SCOPING PLAN. AND WE WILL PLACE A LARGER FOCUS ON OUTCOMES WE IN NEED NEED TO RICHIE'S BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES THE MODELING WILL PROVIDE PAST FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY ENERGY DEPLOYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE RATE OF SALES OF LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR ELECTRIC APPLIANCES THESE METRICS IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL GHG INVENTORY WILL HELP US TRACK PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHEATING NEAR TERMAIR QUALITY BENEFITS AND LONGER TERM GHG BENEFITS. LASTLY I'LL NOTE THAT THE STATUTE REQUIRES US TO ADOPT THE SCRAPPING PLANNED BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE HAVE SEVERAL MILESTONES ALONG THE WAY AN ENVELOPE VIRGINITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE THROUGH UPCOMING SCOPING PLAN WORKSHOPS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEES. MEETINGS AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS BEING PLANNED FOR THIS SUMMER. WE PLAN TO RELEASE THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN AND IT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE BOARD THIS SPRING. TOMORROW WE ARE HOLDING A BOARD MEETING WHERE WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS- THE PROGRESS UP TO TODAY OF THIS WORK. AND WE WILL FOLLOW THE RELEASE OF THE DRAFT WITH WORK OVER THE SUMMER AND THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL SCOPING PLAN IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOR PROPOSED PRODUCTION BY THE BOARD PRESENTATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU- ALAS FAMILIES SERVE IS ROSS BROWN WHO'S WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MR BROWN GOOD MORNING. WITH SADIE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIVE ROSS BROWN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GONNA TRY TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTS SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE IN TODAY'S HEARING MANY OF THE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS RT COME UP IN DISCUSSION TODAY TRY NOT TO REPEAT ANYTHING BUT I DO THINK SOME OF THE- KEY QUESTIONS AND ISSUES ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO EMPHASIZE SOME- FIRST BEFORE I GET STARTED I WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT I AM THAT ELENA REPRESENTATIVES- THAT SERVES AS A NON VOTING MEMBER ON THAT YOU MAX. OUT SO IN PRACTICE THAT MEANS I PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMITTEE'S OPEN MEETINGS AND PROVIDE COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK SOME ON OUTLINES AND DRAFTS. AND WE APPRECIATED BEING PART OF THAT PROCESS AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- HOWEVER THE REPORT FROM MY MAC IS AN ALLY OF DOCUMENT AND DOESN'T REFLECT ONLY A RECOMMENDATIONS NECESSARILY AND SO MY COMMENTS HERE IN THE IN THE HEARING TODAY ARE ARE REALLY AS LEGISLATIVE STOPPER STAFFER AND REPRESENTATIVES. FROM LA YOU KNOW- NOW WE THAT SAID WELL WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THE RIVER. AND A LOT OF THEM. FIND A SENTENCE. FOR THE LETTERS- AND INTEREST OF TIME AT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE SENT HER IMPORTANT. OVER POLICY ISSUES. YOU'RE THE FIRST IS- THIS. PLAN AND I THINK OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF A- PRO. AND ONE OF THE TO TELL. THAT HAD A THERE'S A SCOPING PROCESS. REALLY SHOULD- SHOWED WHY ON HOW THE STATE REACHES ITS GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT TECHNOLOGIES COULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS BUT- EXAMINATION OF THE POLICY OPTIONS- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE- GOT A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF. EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM DESIGN CHANGE BUT- SHOULD HELP IN OUR VIEW INFORM POLICY DISCUSSIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS HOW THOSE COSTS AND BENEFITS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. WHAT'S THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE IN WHEN AND WHY MIGHT THE STATEMENT WENT OUT OTHER. COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES. THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE MAIN POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS INFORMING THAT POLICY DOES POLICY AND BUDGET DECISIONS FOR YOU AS A LEGISLATURE- GOING FORWARD AND UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS AND WE WORRY ABOUT- YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON KIND OF WHAT WHAT THAT MODELING LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE THE CURRENT APPROACH MIGHT NOT PROVIDE THAT TYPE BUT NOW ALSO SO I THINK THAT'S- A LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO ASK YOU MINISTRATION WHETHER THAT. THAT SCOPING PLAN PROCESS WILL FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE POLICY OPTIONS AND TRADE OFFS. AND OTHER EXAMINE THE ROLE OF CONCENTRATING DESIGN OF. COUNTRY AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THE SECOND. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A THE ISSUE ALLOWANCE- AND WE THINK IT'S A- HELPFUL TO HER. KIND OF AN AGREED. PUBLIC MET. FOR THE SIZE OF THE ALLOWANCE BANK. WHICH THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION TONNE. THERE TO TWENTY- MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT THE- TO WHICH SETS UP. AS MUCH MORE TO. IN THE ON A LOT OF REQUESTS. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROGRAM AS- WHETHER THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE DOWN TWENTY THIRTY. BUT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT ARE CONSISTENT WITH RESPECT WE- AT B. L. L. AT HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO ABOUT THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES NOT. NOT BEING CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. AND SO IN OTHER WORDS WITHOUT CHANGES WE DEFEND AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED THERE'S A VERY REAL REST OF THE PROGRAM. DOESN'T DRIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THE STATE IS COMING ON TO ME THAT'S A TWENTY THIRTY G. ISSUE GOALS. SO AS A RESULT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED AND WHAT THE TRADE OFFS MIGHT DEAL. WITH SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENTS. SO THE COMMITTEE MY ALLOW BANKERS IT IS A RE RISK- I KILLED MANY. AND REPORTING BACK ON THE ALLOWANCE THANK BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY-ONE KEY QUESTION IS THAT A VALUATION- TOO LATE- SOMETIMES- REGULATORY PROCESS CAN TAKE. A YEAR OR TWO AND SO- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON THE SIZE OF THE BANK NOW. AND YOU WAIT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTY TWENTIES- YOU COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN TIME TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. THE THIRD- AND FINALISED I REALLY HIGHLIGHT IS JUSTICE OF A MARKER OF. SO TO FIX THE LEGISLATURE. AGREES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROGRAM STRINGENCY AND THAT THERE ARE. THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR CHANGES SOME. THEY ALL REQUIRE CAREFUL THOUGHT AND DESIGN AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO ALL OF THEM IN DETAIL. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF KEY THOUGHTS AGAIN REITERATING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE- REPORT. ONE IS THAT WE AGREE THAT IT'S BETTER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES AND KIND OF A RULE BASED MANNER SO- YOU KNOW SETTING UP RULES AND CRITERIA. CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ON KIND OF WHEN ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE AND WHY IT RATHER THAN KIND OF AN AD HOC BASIS WE THINK THAT. HELPS PROVIDE A GREATER MARKET CERTAINTY- AND THE ADJUSTMENTS WE THINK SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S CLIMATE GOALS IN MIND SORT OF FOCUS ON- KIND OF WHAT THE MISSION GOALS. PRODUCING EMISSIONS IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE GOALS. ARE IT IS IMPORTANT AS MY COLLEAGUE- COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED THAT ADJUSTMENTS COULD RESULT IN. HIGHER PRICES WHICH DOES HAVE A STRAIGHT OFF OF FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF HIGHER HOUSEHOLD ENERGY COSTS FOR EXAMPLE- HOWEVER WE THINK. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MAYBE GETTING THOSE TYPES OF IMPACTS ARE ARE IMPORTANT BUT SHOULDN'T. REALLY BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ON SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAM DESIGN FEATURES A CIVICALLY. THINGS LIKE- PRICE DECLINES IN THE LEVEL THE PRICE CEILING WHICH IS KIND OF SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT TRYING TO MAKE IT MITIGATE THAT AFFECTS. AND IMPORTANTLY THE USE OF ALLOWANCE REVENUE- SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY YOUR MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. HOW REVENUE CAN BE USED TO PARK PARTIALLY OR FULLY OFFSET. ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL IMPACTS THROUGH TAX REBATES OR OR TAX REDUCTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF AN IMPORTANT SET OF CONSIDERATIONS AROUND KIND OF THE- THE CONVERSATION AROUND AWHILE AND SUPPLY BUT WE DO THINK DECISIONS ABOUT. ADJUSTING THE ALLOWANCE SUPPLY SHOULD. SHOULD BE MAINLY FOCUSED ON KIND OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND THEN SOME OF THESE OTHER MECHANISMS COULD BE USED TO. MITIGATE. ANY POTENTIAL FINANCIAL AND I. GOT IMPACT. SO IN MY COMMENTS. HERE BUT IF WE'RE- TO. ANY QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE HAS YOUR TODAY AND PROVIDE ANY. ASSISTANCE THIS ISSUE GOING FOR. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO WORK YOU VERY. LOOK START OFF WITH THE- SENDER TO. HAS QUESTIONS. THANK YOU RICHARD TODAY I AM. I HAVE IN ORDER GO THROUGH SO I WILL NOT LOSE TRACK SO I WANT TO START UP WITH- SO THEY IS FOR ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE. WHAT IS THE CURRENT NUMBER OF POLLUTERS THAT BUY SELL OR TRADE ALLOWANCES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS WITHIN THE STATE. IS THERE IS THERE DATA ON THAT. YES SENATOR- OFF THE TOP MY HEAD YOU KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER BUT THERE'S AROUND FOUR HUNDRED ENTITIES THAT ARE REGULATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CHAIR THE CARD CHAIRMAN WISH TO CORRECT ME I CAN PULL THAT UP FOR YOU. THERE ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NOT WHAT WE CALL COMPLIANCE ENTITIES PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM BUT WHO PARTICIPATE AS INVESTORS- SPECULATORS AS OTHER KINDS OF ACTORS IN THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF THIS MARKET BUT ON THE ORDER OF FOUR HUNDRED- COMPANIES AND ENTITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT ABOUT OUT OF STATE. CENTER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW- AND I SUSPECT THAT. I KNOW KARMA HAS THAT INFORMATION I'LL TRY AND LOOK IT UP WHILE WE'RE SPEAKING HERE. OKAY THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE I. E. MAC. ONE OF THE CARBON. WHAT OTHER CARBON COST IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH THE COST OF CARBON IN CAP AND TRADE. IS THERE AN OVERLAP. A FEDERAL JUDGE FIRST OTHERS MAY WANT TO ADD ON TO THIS. IS CLEARLY AN OVERLAP AND BY DESIGN AND OVERLAP THE- THE- REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT EVERYTHING FROM THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD TO. ENTER YOUR CYSTITIS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OF CENTRAL ALL OF WHAT MANY OF THEM. AFFECT THE SAME SOURCES THAT ARE COVERED BY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CAP AND TRADE THE COUPLE MARKET COVERS APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE STATE ABOUT US. GENERALLY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS THE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS SOCIALLY WITH FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION. AND THEN MANY OTHER SOURCES DISPERSED- GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WOULD INCLUDE. METHANE FROM A MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE STORED NATURAL GAS USE- OTHER EMISSIONS OF SOCIAL NETWORKING LANDS. AND SUCH FOR THE- SHOULD CELTIC YOU'RE- YES SOME THANK YOU THE NOW THIS IS FOR- DELEO- MISTER ROSS HOW MUCH CLOSER WOULD WE BE TOWARDS REACHING OUR TWENTY THIRTY. GOAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AT THE STATE BEGAN COUNTING CARBON EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES. SENATOR DOLLY- MEANS TO THE NET I JUST MY- INITIAL REACTION IS THE NET EMISSIONS FROM FORESTS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT SOURCE OF EMISSIONS TO COUNT- IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF ANNUAL VARIATION AND WILDFIRE RELATED EMISSIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE- I THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THE ESTIMATE WAS THAT THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION TONS. OF EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES BUT THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS CLOSER TO FIVE MILLION TIMES A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON THE ANNUAL BERRY ATION. PLUS THE NET IMPACT ON CARBON I'M GONNA NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE CARBON THAT'S BEEN SEQUESTERED IN STORED EACH YEAR SO I THINK. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SOME YEARS ADDING WILDFIRE EMISSIONS WOULD PUT US FURTHER AWAY FROM OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND IN SOME CASES KIND OF QUITE A BIT FURTHER. BUT IN OTHER YEARS- YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT ABOUT THE ISSUE GIVEN THIS ANNUAL VARIATION AND KIND OF LONGER TIME HORIZONS KIND OF A DECADE AT A TIME BECAUSE. THERE IS A LOT OF THIS ANNUAL FLUCTUATION. WELL DOES YOUR YOUR WAY WE DON'T. WE DON'T COUNT THOSE CARD WE DO COUNT FOREST FIRE. SO IT IS A TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT I TO BUILD TRY TO GET A GET US THE LARGEST TO COUNTER WE DON'T CARE SO THAT THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE. THIS COULD BE FOUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE R. A. R. B. WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF THE STATE BEGAN ACCOUNT FORCED EMISSIONS TOWARDS OUR STATEWIDE GOAL. I THINK THAT AS AS ROSS NOTED IT IS CHALLENGING TO- CALCULATE- THAT GHG EMISSIONS FROM. WILDFIRE GIVEN THAT- SOME OF ITS NATURAL SOME OF ITS- ANTHROPOGENIC- AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE. AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT WOULD. WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE WE DO- TRACK WILDFIRE EMISSIONS- WE ASSESS THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE EMISSIONS. AND THE STATE HAS. OF COURSE. BEEN PUTTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND EFFORT INTO REDUCING WILDFIRES- SO AS- IN THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CHAPTER OF THE SCOPING PLAN WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO AS MUCH. ANALYSIS OF THAT AS POSSIBLE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MY NEXT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE FOR MR CALLING WARD I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY- HI I HAVE. IN PRESENT THE ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT YOU HELPED WRITE. IN READING THAT REPORT OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS IN REVIEWING THE ARTICLE ON THE REPORT. IN THE INSIDE EPA WHICH WAS TITLED PEACE. THE PANEL WANTS HIGHER GHG CREDIT CRISIS. WOULD YOU LIKE THE FLOOR OF THE PRICE WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO. THE FLOOR PRICE OF CARBON INCREASED IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR ADJUSTER BRIEFLY CLARIFY THE I MAC REPORT DOES NOT CALL FOR THE APPROPRIATE PRICE DOUBLED THAT SHOULD BE SET- BUT I DO WANT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY BECAUSE I THINK YOU RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION- MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT. THE PRICE FOR WE CURRENTLY HAVE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE CAPITATE PROGRAM PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DRIVING OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TO THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET SO IF POLICYMAKERS WISH TO HAVE A LARGE ROLE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND WISH TO HIT THE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED TARGET. AND I THINK PRICES DO NEED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE FOR- BUT AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY THE REPORT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY CALL FOR- A PARTICULAR PRICE LEVEL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A POLICY QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO SOME EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL- I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE WITH THE COVERAGE YOU SITE BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. VERY BRIEFLY IF I MAY SENATOR- WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRE MISSIONS QUESTION THIS IS AN ISSUE OF COLLEAGUES AND ARE WRKING ON RIGHT NOW I'LL BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MEGA FIRES LIKE WE SAW IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASONS. FIRES ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT BAD THE FORESTS ARE PROBABLY CLOSE TO A SINK OR TO HELPING US AND WHEN WE HAVE THE PRESENCE OF THESE BAD YEARS FORCE MAKE THE CHALLENGE HARDER TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT INCLUDING FORESTS MAKES IT EASIER OR HARDER I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE FORESTS ARE ACTUALLY HURTING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE AND THAT COMICAL BECAUSE OF THE FIRE RISK THAT WESTERN FORCES FACE IN PARTICULAR- GET HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON ANY OF THAT. I WILL. I WANTED. TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT WHEN I WHEN TO FOLLOW UP ON MY- ORIGINAL. WHAT OF. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRICE OF CARBON SHOULD BE SHOULD BE FIFTY SIXTY DOLLARS. HUNDRED WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE I KNOW THAT- DIVIDED ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES IT SHOULD BE AROUND FIFTY ONE. DOLLARS YES YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE WHAT'S CALLED THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON WHICH IS A FAIRLY STANDARD WAY THAT ACADEMICS HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT. THE LONG TERM SOCIAL DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE WITH CARBON AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION SO I THINK THAT'S RELEVANT MY COLLEAGUE DALLAS KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THAT WORK- I'M- AGAIN. I'M NOT IN ANY WAY TRYING TO DODGE YOUR QUESTION THIS IS A POLICY QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. OUR JOB AND THE IF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT LEAST AS I SEE IT. IS TO ADVISE ON THE CHOICES THE POLICIES ARE MAKERS ARE MAKING AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE CONSISTENT SO THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU IT IS. VERY DIFFICULT TO SPECIFY A PRECISE NUMBER. BUT THE NUMBER NEEDS TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE POLICY STRATEGY. AND SO A KEY PREDICATE TO YOUR QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF A ROLE THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE PLAYING. IN ORDER TO GET TO OUR TARGET. THERE ARE OTHER POLICIES AND MEASURES WE USE SOME OF WHICH ARE RELATIVELY COST EFFECTIVE SOME OF WHICH ARE RELATIVELY NOT COST EFFECTIVE. AND THE COMBINATION OF POLICIES IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE OVERALL COST PROFILE WOULD BE TO GET THERE- I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ISSUE THE MODEL THAT I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE CHALLENGE FACING THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND- DRESSING THE TYPE OF QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO BE MADE EXPLICIT. AND ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS THERE AREN'T CLEAR EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT UNCERTAINTY CREATES CHALLENGES IN THE LONG RUN THAT ARE THAT ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN TRYING TO SET A CORRECT NUMBER. AND A FISCAL POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NUMBER. WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT- I THINK THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE CONTINUALLY. PASSES LEGISLATION TO SET TARGETS. WE HAVE A TWENTY THIRD GOAL. WITH THAT NEEDS TO BE SET AND ACHIEVE THOSE THERE'S AN IMPACT TO THE CONSUMER I MEAN OF THE DAY IN IN IN- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ON CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BY CAR THEY STATED THE FOLLOWING CONTENT THIS IS THIS IS FOR EVERY FOR EVERY. TEN DOLLARS IN THE ALLOWANCE COST. THE GALLON OF GAS GOES UP NINE CENTS A GALLON OF DIESEL GOES UP TEN CENTS. BUT FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS. NATURAL GAS GOES UP POINT FIVE. PER THERM ELECTRICITY RATES GO UP SIX DOLLARS AND THIRTY FIVE CENTS PER MEGAWATT SO THAT'S SIX CENTS A KILOWATT. SIX POINT THREE FIVE CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR- SO THIS IS THIS IS THE QUESTION NEED TO BE ASKED BECAUSE- IF WE DO GO TO NUMBER IS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL IT'S GOING TO DIRECTLY IMPACT THE COST OF LIVING TO EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN. IN IN AND THAT'S IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED- I WILL BE I'M BERNARD SHAW HAS HIS HAND UP SO MAYBE HE'S THE CHAIR OF THE- I MAC. DOCTOR WANTED TO GIVE IT A CRACK. THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT DANNY COHEN WORDS. A WORD FOR WORD. I THINK. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE- IN THE NEXT WEEK MONTHS IF NOT WEEKS I WOULD EXPECT THE BY DEMONSTRATION TO REVISE THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND IT WILL. IT'S CONFIDENTIAL NOW AND I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION. BUT BASED ON THE LITTER ON AN EXTENSIVE ADDITIONAL LITERATURE SINCE LAST TIME WAS UPDATED. I THINK THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON ESTIMATES WILL DOUBLE OR MORE WILL BE A THREE DAY JUST IN TERMS OF THE- NATIONAL ELSE LITTLE WHAT THE IMPACT ON SOCIETY AS PER TON OF CARBON. ADMITTED HOWEVER. IS DANNY STARTED TO ANSWER. DOES THAT- YEAH SHOULD YOU WANTED FROM AN ECONOMIC FOR THAT'S WITH PRICE OF COVERAGE BE BUT IT'S NOT WHAT THE PRICE OF CARBON CAN BE IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE POLITICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY I WOULD ARGUE ABOUT MY PAY GRADE SENATOR BUT THAT STATE CANNOT SUPPORT SUSTAINED A TYPE OF A PRICE LEVEL WITH THE ACTING INDIVIDUALLY AS A STATE SO THEREFORE THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE DESIGN OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO. INVOLVES USING A CARBON PRICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LOW COST MR REDUCTIONS LOOK BEHIND BUT ALSO IT FEARS OF REGULATORY MEASURES TO TRY TO DRIVE INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT AND TRY TO ACHIEVE CARBON REDUCTIONS A WAY THAT WILL JUST TRIGGER LEAKAGE ACROSS THE FACILITY THE RESPECT YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WHAT I ADVOCATE FOR PRICE FOR TO BE INCREASED OR NOT AS THE AGENDAS OF THE NETWORK SAID THAT IS NOT OUR JOB BUT I WILL POINT OUT THE RIGHT NOW SINCE THE PRICE IS WELL TEN OR TWELVE DOLLARS ABOVE THE PRICE FLOOR. I DON'T SEE WHERE HOW WOULD HELP THE STATE GOALS IN ANY WAY EXCEPT FOR THE CUTE AFFORDABILITY QUESTION YOU JUST RAISE KEEPING OUT OF MIND I DOESN'T OPEN CIRCLES ANYWAY TO SEE THE PRICE COME BACK DOWN AND DROP TEN DOLLARS BACK TO THE PRESS FOR SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS PART THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS I THINK THAT THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS ALL SLICKLY AND FINALLY. WE ARE THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED A VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT ARE THERE COULD BE POSSIBLE AND ONE OF THOSE WOULD NOT JUST BE TO RAISE THE PRICE FOR BETTER INCREASE SO IT'S A PRICE RESPONSE TO SUPPLY FOOD WHEN IT'S CHEAPER TO ACHIEVE A MISS REDUCTIONS MORE EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR KERR OR BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO SO BUT MORE MISSIONAL ELSE'S MODEM TO THE MARKET SO THAT'S WHY I WENT TO PREVIOUSLY HAD SOME WAX DESCRIBING ADDITIONAL PRICE STEPPER PRICE STEPS THAT COULD BE ADDED TO THE MARKET. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A REFORM THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN JUST INCREASING THE PRICE FOR SECRETARY RUMSFELD- BUT WITHSTANDING THE- HEDGE FUND MAN THERE IN HERE- CAN YOU. AS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT I THINK RANDALL. SAID ISRAEL WELL I'M VISAS ARE NOT NEW EXCLUSIVE WE CAN REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GAS AND I'LL POLLUTANTS AND- MANAGER FOR AND THAT AND I THINK SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT DOES THAT- WE'RE INCREDIBLY FOCUSED INTO THE TALLY ON THIS ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY- AND THAT HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INTO EVERY ELEMENT OF. HOW WE PLAN HOW WE EXAMINE WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW WE'RE DOING AND THAT AND I THINK. PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU'LLFOCUSING ON AND HELPING US FOCUS ON IS IF YOU JUST LOOK A CAP AND TRADE IN ISOLATION OF ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES AND INNOVATION- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE FULL PICTURE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA. TACKLE OUR PRODUCTION GOALS- BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE WE ARE WE ARE INCREDIBLY FOCUSED ON THINGS FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THAT CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. IS DOING ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY THAT HELPS PEOPLE SAVE ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS- WEEK IN WEEK OUT THE SAME IS NOW TRUE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST OF. MAINTAINING AND OWNING AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE THIS IS THE FUEL AT THE PUMP AND WE'RE PUTTING IN TIME TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S SIGNIFICANT FUNDING INTO LOW INCOME PROGRAMS TO. HELP BRIDGE THOSE AFFORDABILITY GAP SO AFFORDABILITY IS A VERY SHE'S CONCERNED. THAT WE SHARE AND JUST TO GO BACK TO- CHECK THAT TROLLS COMMENT- THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IS AND WHAT THE IMPACTS OF CARBON HOW THEY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ECONOMY OUR HEALTH- IT ISN'T DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WALK KABIN SHOULD COST WITHIN THE CAP AND TRADE- ANY. MARKET BASED MECHANISM THAT THAT SEPARATE- ISSUES IN TO CONFLATE THEM I THINK- LEADS AN IMPRESSION THE OLDEST COST NEEDS TO BE BORN THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. WE NEED TO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT COBB AND IS HAVING INCREDIBLY DAMAGING EFFECTS ON OUR HEALTH TODAY AS YOU ARTICULATED ON. WILDFIRE SMOKE ALONE- BUT LOOK AT THE DROUGHT FOR US- AND THE EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF CALCULATED INTO THE SOCIAL COST. OF CARBON- AND SO WE ARE PAYING FOR THEM. AND I AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO COLLECTIVELY IS COME OUT WITH A SET OF MEASURES THAT REDUCE CARBON. AT THE SAME TIME DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. STUFF CALIFORNIANS. SENATOR ALL MY PURSE ALL THOSE IN BUT I THINK THE KEY THING I HEARD A THERE WAS A HOLISTIC. SO I'VE BEEN HERE TEN YEARS AND UNLIMITED HERE. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. BILL FOREST FIRE IN. WE SEEM TO USE IT AS WE BURNED ALMOST FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRES. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE IT IS. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THAT THAT'S OUR SEEK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE LEARNED IN FIFTH GRADE IS WHAT WE READ OUT THE TREES BREEDING BUT THEY'RE DEAD. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT SEQUESTERING CARBON. EMITTING CARBON. ENTERS THE POLICIES OF HOW WE MANAGE OUR FOREST WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION WHICH IS NOT NATURAL TO ARE FORCED. IN THE FORCE NATURALLY THIN ITSELF WITH FIRE. WE NEED TO THIN OR FORCE ALLOWED TO BE ALIVE WHEN FIRE CAN WIN THEN WE CAN HAVE FAR TO GO THROUGH THERE SO WE POINT TO THE FIRE. AND THE SMOKE AND THE- IN THE- HEALTH. THE ISSUES THAT COME WITH THAT AND THEN WE GO AND REGULATE. THE CARS IN BREEDERS AND LAWN MOWERS AND SMALL GENERATORS THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED EVERY DAY TO. SUSTAIN LIFE WHEN THERE'S NO POWER IN THE STATE SO HOLISTICALLY I WANT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND WE DON'T SEEM TO EVER TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE LONG TERM GOAL IS GOING TO BE AT THE SAME TIME. MY CONSTITUENTS AND EVERYONE OF THE SENATOR'S CONSTITUENTS COST OF. THINGS THAT THEY USE EVERY DAY IS SKYROCKETING IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS. THE ONE UP A DOLLAR FOR DIESEL IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS THAT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY IT COST ME FOR EACH TRUCK. THAT'S DRIVES UP THE COST OF A LOAF OF BREAD- WHEN YOU BUILD A HOUSE ALL THAT GETS PASSED ON TO THE END USER AND THE POOREST. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE ARE GETTING DEVASTATE WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE. THOSE PEOPLE. THERE ARE ENOUGH FOR THE PEOPLE ON A FIXED INCOME ARE GETTING ESTROYED IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S BECAUSE THESE POLICIES DON'T LINE UP WITH LIKE REALLY REDUCING CARBON AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN MY- MY- FRUSTRATION OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE WE DON'T. THEY DON'T THERE'S NO HOLISTIC PROGRAM HERE SO I WANT TO JUST ADD. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB THREE NINETY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CENTERPIECE OF THAT. WAS TO KANE CONTAIN COST AND PROTECT CONSUMERS. THOSE ARE OUR CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW THERE IN MY MIND AREN'T BEING PROTECTED WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS. WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT CHANGING THIS PROGRAM WE'RE ONLY TWO YEARS INTO IT. THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND I HAVE SINCE. MY LAST THREE OR FOUR QUESTIONS. I HAVE HERE IS- FOR CHAIR RAND OFF. SO FOR THE CHAIR WELL WHAT PERCENTAGE. IS THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM PLAYING IN REDUCING GHG UNDER THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN. HE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING CLAN- ASSUMED ABOUT A THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT- ROLE FOR CAP AND TRADE AND THE NEWS COMING PLAN WILL. ANALYZE WHAT WORLD CAP AND TRADE SHOULD PLAY- WE WILL LOOK AT ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR REDUCING CARBON- LOOKING AT- WHAT REDUCTIONS WE EXPECT. TO GET FROM THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SOME OF WHICH DID NOT EXIST- DURING THIS TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCRAPPING PLANNED SO IT'LL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THOSE- AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT KEPT THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SHOULD- EXPECT TO COVER- BEYOND THOSE PROGRAMS AND SAID THAT'S THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. MY SECOND WOULD BE WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS PLAYING IN REDUCING GHGS IN THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN. SO AGAIN THAT WILL BE PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT IN- FULL EFFECT- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO THERE WILL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO. DETERMINE WHAT ROLE L. CSS WILL BE PLAYING. SO WHICH PROGRAM IT IN ARE YOU EVALUATING THE SCOPING PLAN GETS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF GHG REDUCTIONS FOR THE LEAST COST PER TON. THAT'S PART OF THE ANALYSIS WERE DOING RIGHT NOW THAT WE- WILL BE REALLY RELEASING LATER THIS SPRING AND THAT WILL THAT WILL BE. OUT WHEN RESULTS THAT'LL BE OUT IN MID MARCH AND THEN WE WILL HAVE A DRAFT. OF THE PROPOSED CAPPING PLAN AND IN LATE APRIL. MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN IS PREPARING FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOAL. OF THE BEAT THAT CARBON NEUTRAL AND THE STATES AUTHORIZED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH- BUT BY THE WAY WAS APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE. IS SET TO EXPIRE IN TWENTY THIRTY. HOW DO HOW DO YOU PLAN ON MAKING UP THE FIFTEEN YEAR GAP OF GHG REDUCTIONS WITHOUT AN AUTHORIZED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- SO THIS COMING PLAN WILL ASSESS OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS THE- TWENTY THIRTY GOALS- 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. AND WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT CARBON NEUTRALITY WE BUY TWENTY FORTY FIVE OR SOONER- WE WILL ASSESS- A ROLE FOR CAP AND TRADE- BUT TO YOUR POINT IT IS TRUE THAT- BY A LOT IT- IT. ENDS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LAN NEED ASK QUESTIONS TODAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME LAST COMMENTS HERE. MY LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN. I'VE I THINK I'VE VOICED IT PRETTY LOUD PRETTY PLAINLY OVER THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE CALIFORNIA. PRODUCES WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. THERE WERE TOUTED AS LEADING THE WORLD AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO. REDUCE CARBON. NUMBER ONE WE DON'T COUNT THE EMISSIONS FROM FOREST FIRE. WHICH WE PUT OUR FORCES IN THE SHAPE THAT IT'S IN THERE IS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO THE MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT WE HAVE OVER THE LAST SIXTY TO SEVENTY YEARS. AND WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY. THEN THE FOREST AND TAKE CARE OF OUR WATERSHEDS OF FIRE CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE FORCE WITHOUT COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE FORCE WE HAVE. ROUND CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT WE CAN REDUCE THOSE MISSIONS AND- MANY OF THE LEGISLATORS HAVE BEEN OUT. TO MY DISTRICT TO SEE WHERE WE STAND AND FIRE CAME THROUGH WE STILL HAVE A FORCE THAT'S ALIVE AFTERTHE FIRE COMES THROUGH IT IS STILL. THE QUESTION CARBON AND ACTUALLY WHEN WITHIN THE FOREST IT GROWS TREES FASTER WHICH SEQUESTERS MORE CARBON SO THERE'S A REAL. PUBLIC BENEFIT TO DOING GOOD FORESTRY. TWO THIRDS OF STATE IS FORESTED IN THE STAIRS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE DO THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT. IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA BUILDING IS SKYROCKETING FOOD IS SKYROCKETING AND IT'S DUE TO THESE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE COULD WE SET TARGETS WITHOUT A BRIDGE TO GET THERE. LAST WEEK IN SUB TWO WE TALKED ABOUT EV'S. N. EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE GOING TO GET. THEY GET THEY GET EXACTLY ORDERS THAT ARE GOING TO GIVE US. ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN CHARGES ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO I'M LOOKING FOR OVERALL POLICY OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR GOALS APPRECIATE YOUR- TIME IN ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR US CENTER STERN YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU JERRY CASKEY AND- THANKS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND- I MAX- MEMBERS FOR JOINING US AS WELL HI I TAKE A SIMILAR I GUESS BUT SLIGHTLY. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH- I THINK I SHARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERNS ABOUT I GUESS WE'RE CALLING AFFORDABILITY. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY I THINK ABOUT THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THIS STATE TO AFFORD. A FUTURE OF RELENTLESS AN UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE A FUTURE WHERE YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS IN RUSSIA OR SAUDI ARABIA TO DECIDE- HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING WHEN YOU FILL UP YOUR DIESEL TRUCK EVERY DAY. OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO LIVE IN YOUR REFINERY- OR NEAR A CEMENT FACTORY OR A GAS FIELD- OR PEOPLE SIMPLY JUST LIVE NEAR FREEWAYS AND- THE INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN. THE PREMATURE BIRTHS AND PREMATURE DEATHS THAT. WE GO THROUGH- AS A STATE AND THE ABJECT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- THAT'S BEEN FALLING AS WELL YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH COVETED- THIS HUGE. UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL INJUSTICES IS MOUNTING DAILY SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO JUST THINK ABOUT TWENTY FORTY FIVE HERE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU KNOW THERE WERE CERTAIN SORT OF MINIMUM THRESHOLD SET IN LAW BY THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH SP THIRTY TWO AND- IN THE FINER POINT WAS PUT ON ALL THAT BY- EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT- MY FIRST QUESTION. IS REALLY LOOKING AT. SORT OF WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THE NEAR TERM. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT TARGETS AND GOALS- AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO SORT OF INFORM THIS IS MARKET BASED REDUCTION CONVERSATION THE CAP AND TRADE CONVERSATION BUT- I THINK IF WE END UP AT THE ESPY BUT WE HAVEN'T TRANSFORMED CALIFORNIA. I WILL FAILED THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW WHEN WE SET THOSE NUMBERS IN LAW BACK THEN THERE'S A LOT WE DIDN'T KNOW. TO MR BURR TRUST POINT ABOUT SOCIAL COST OF CARBON. WHATEVER THAT REGRESSION ANALYSIS OR WHATEVER WE THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN BEAR TO AFFORD WHO ARE NOW UNDER WATER AND HAUSER HAD THEIR COMMUNITIES BURNED DOWN OR HAD THEIR BUSINESSES GO UP IN SMOKE OR LOST THEIR LIVES LIKE. THAT SOCIAL COST ACTUALLY IS A LOT HIGHER THAN WE OFTEN ESTIMATE. SO I KNOW THE BITE ADMINISTRATION IS SET. GOALS NATIONWIDE- FOR TWENTY THIRTY THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN WHAT CALIFORNIA'S BEEN LOOKING AT I THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FIT THEY'RE FAR AND IN OUR LOWER AND I THINK YOU COULD BE ALMOST AS MUCH AS 10% MORE. PRODUCTIONS- SET OUT A GOAL FOR THE FOR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND WE LIKE TO PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING LEADERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I GUESS I'M WONDERING. IF THERE'S ANY HOPE FOR GOING FASTER AND FOR THE KIND OF NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS THAT. I THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF ACHIEVING HERE- IN THE NEAR TERM IN CALIFORNIA SO IS THERE JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL ANY PERSPECTIVE- OR ANY HOPE TO GIVE US HERE THAT. GOOD WE CAN TACKLE THIS EMERGENCY AND OF COURSE WE HAVE TO MODEL OUT TO DID YOU KNOW TWO DECADES FROM NOW BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BREATHE TODAY- WELL HOPE CAN YOU. YOUR YOUR LENDERS HERE. IS THAT GO TO THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE FAIR BOARD CHAIR AT THE GATES ON THAT ONE AND I THINK YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP TESTING. RIGHT I THINK THERE IS- THERE IS A LOT TO BE HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS VERY SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE STRATEGIES- TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO- LOOKING AT THE ENERGY SECTOR FOR INSTANCE- THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE HAS BEEN DRAMATIC AND- AND CONTINUES- WE ARE THE LARGEST- HAVE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF ENERGY STORAGE- IN ANY JURISDICTION IN THE WORLD- SO WE ARE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS ACHIEVING THOSE TARGETS OUR- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE WORK IS- CONTINUES TO SHOW RESULTS- THE MARKETS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO TRANSITION- BOTH LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TO ZERO EMISSION- WE CONTINUE TO SET BROWN GROUNDBREAKING POLICIES LIKE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD- TO REDUCE REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF OUR TRANSPORTATION FUELS- WE CONTINUE TO MAKE- NEW STRIDES LEGISLATIVELY FOR INSTANCE AROUND CEMENT AND- SETTING- GOALS AND STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON IN THAT IN THE CEMENT SECTOR- SO I THINK CALIFORNIA. CONTINUES TO. LEAVE THE WAY IN TERMS ACTUAL SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE STRATEGIES- THAT WILL MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOAL NOT JUST SETTING A NEW GOAL- BUT- BUT REALLY IMPLEMENTING THE POLICIES. THAT MAKE THOSE GOALS ACHIEVABLE. AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THAT IS THAT RIGHT SOMETIMES WE GET SO. YOU KNOW STOVE PIPED INTO THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE LOSE PICTURE- ALL SIDE OF THE BIG PICTURE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU KIND OF ZOOMING OUT- WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY IS ONE MARKET BASED MECHANISM BUT DEAL PINE. WE NEED SOME HELP AND- LIVES- AS WE READ. IT OUT HEADLINE AFTER HEADLINE ABOUT A WAR EXPERIENCE REALITIES HERE ON THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA OF DROUGHT- WILDFIRE EXTREME HE AND THEY WERE ALL OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE I WOULD POINT TO I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING THINGS AS SENATOR THAT I. HAVE DISSIPATED AND- WITH THE ENTIRE GOVERNOR'S TEAM AND LED BY THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF IS THE BUDGET- THAT JAN TEN DOCUMENT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION. FIVE YEAR BUDGET PLAN- IT GOES THROUGH AND IS I HAVE DESCRIBED I MEAN IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. EXAMINATIONS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH- THE. SHOW THAT WHERE WE'RE HELPING TO THE FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT NEED IT THE MOST THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THAT WE CREATE JOBS- THAT HIERO JOBS THAT THAT WHOLE COMMUNITIES- GROW AND PROSPER AND THAT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO. I'M JUST A FEW OF THOSE THINGS- AND ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED AND FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON ON LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS BUT THERE'S TEN BILLION- WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WITH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT LOOKS AT ZERO MISSION- VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY- PUTTING LITERALLY BILLIONS INTO THINGS LIKE ELECTIONS SCHOOL BUT- SAYS- TRANSPORTATION. NINE POINT ONE BILLION TO LOOK ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION HOW WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES BUT WE LOOK AT ALLOWANCES IT'S NOT EVEN UNDERSTANDING AT THIS YEAR'S VMC HOW HOWEVER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED OUR GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE. INTO ACTIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO DO THAT I'M CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN ENERGY. LOAN PROGRAM- NO THANK EXCITING THINGS AND THE- AND- A GOVERNOR NEWSOM YES. WE'RE TALKING- ABOUT LITHIUM VALLEY AND THE POTENTIAL OF REALLY LIFTING UP THE IMPERIAL VALLEY- AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THROUGH THAT MASSIVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND THEN THINGS LIKE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES I'M LOOKING AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. ARE PUTTING MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO THOSE AND THEN HELPS- WE OFTEN. BIFURCATE THESE ISSUES FOR ALL OF US WE NOTE THAT HEALTHY CLIMATE INEXTRICABLY LINKED- THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TWO YEARS AGO DESCRIBED. CLIMATE CHANGE AS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY I'M LOOKING AT HELPING BUILD OUT PROGRAMS TO GET AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. I'M INTO COMMUNITIES TO HELP WITH EVERYTHING FROM HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE ASTHMA THAT ARE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE- AS WELL AS INNOVATION AND- HOW WE BUILD THIS INTO THEIR- PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING AS STRAUSS- JOBS. AND TO THE POINT THAT SENATOR DOLLY RAIDS- HAVE A TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP DEAL WITH FOREST MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE- IT'S INCREDIBLE. TO THE FULLEST- I WOULD ENCOURAGE SPENCE'S NAME TO READ IT STARTS ON PAGE EIGHTY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WHAT IT DOES THAT SOUNDED- IS I THINK IT FRAMES OUT WALK CALIFORNIA OFFICES THE WILD WHICH IS A HOPE OF. HOW WE REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS. WHILE LIFTING UP COMMUNITIES AND HOPEFULLY SAVING PEOPLE MONEY MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL SAVE PEOPLE MONEY WHEN THAT IMPLEMENTED IT I'M SORRY. I HAVE THIS TWIN. FEELING. OF- ANXIETY DREAD CRIME CHANGE BUT WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN TOGETHER- AND HOW WE CAN COLLAB YOU FOR RAISING THAT QUEST. I APPRECIATE THE AND- CAN BE HEALING SO I WOULD I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU I JUST FROM A FROM A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE I GUESS I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. DO WE HAVE- A QUANTIFIABLE HOPE OF EXCEEDING THE TALK THE CURRENT TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS IF WE SAY REALIZE ALL THESE INVESTMENTS AND PURSUE ALL THE OTHER DIRECT MEASURES AS WELL AS A WELL MANAGED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS THERE IS THAT A IS THAT A SCENARIO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FINDS THAT LIKELY OR OR POTENTIALLY LIKELY REASONABLY LIKELY THAT WE COULD WE COULD CHECK IN AT J. RANDALL CAN ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT COPS GETTING IN THE SCOPING PLAN. IS TO SCENARIO OUT AND JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR THE GOVERNOR INSTRUCTED ALL OF US- HE AND BILLY AND DISCUSS THIS VERY CLEARLY WHICH IS NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO COBB IS DOING SCENARIO PLANNING TO LOOK AT HOW AGGRESSIVELY TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS. DOWN BUT I'LL TURN IT J. RANDALL- YES THAT'S CORRECT M. S. WE ARE LOOKING AT- SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE- TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE- I THINK ONE AREA THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS IS THAT THE M. ALICE'S WILL INCLUDE. SOME ANALYSIS AROUND UNCERTAINTIES AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT NO ONE INDIVIDUAL AND NO OR NO ONE ENTITY CONTROLS IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGIES- VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL MENTIONED THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE- IT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON A LOT OF WORK STATEWIDE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO. CONSIDER THE LAND USE POLICIES THAT WILL RESULT IN- IN A REDUCTION IN RELIANCE ON. VEHICLES ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS RENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT- AS THESE PROJECTS NEED TO BE BUILT- AND THEY NEED TO BE LOCATED AND BECOME OPERATIONAL- AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE RATE OF BUILD OUT- THAT ACTUALLY OCCURS ON THE GROUND MATCHES THE PLANNING AND THAT THE P. U. C. C. C. AND THE CASE- ARE ALL DOING IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDIT- SO.YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE VERY MINDFUL THAT- THESE ARE THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT OUR POLICYMAKERS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- IN THE STATE ARE GOING TO NEED TO UNDERTAKE AND BE WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL. OF. EVERY CHEATING THE TARGETS THAT WE SET. THANKS FOR THE AND A I DIRECT THAT IN YOU TAKE- YOU WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW. SIX GIGAWATTS ZEROTH FUHRMAN ZERO CARBON ASELOAD RENEWABLE POWER CLUB TO CITE THOSE FACILITIES AREBUILT THE TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED COUNTIES AND CITIES ON BOARD AND- YOU KNOW MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITIES AND SO. IT'S A FAIR POINT ON THE UNCERTAINTY PIECE- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE LITTLE SHOT I HOPE THAT- YOU ALL GAVE OUT THERE I. GOT TO GO BACK TO. TO PESSIMISM HERE- BUT I GUESS IT'S MORE JUST REALISM- YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE TOUGH TO REACH SECTORS THAT YOU MENTIONED- IT ESPECIALLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR SAW DIRECT EMISSION INCREASES- AS THE LAST COPING PLAN UPDATE I'M THINKING OF SPECIFICALLY IN REFINING AND CEMENT- I KNOW THAT THIS WAS A- PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOCUS- FOR. A LOT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT- YOU KNOW- IMPACTS OF. CAP AND TRADE IN THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES- IDEAS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD LIKE- NO TREATING ZONES OR OTHER WAYS. THROUGH CAP AND TRADE BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE'S SORT OF DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL CAN YOU CAN YOU WILL TOUCH ON- THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND- THAT SORT OF HARD TO REACH HIGH HEAT- HIGH- YEAH THE HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED INDUSTRIES THAT. THAT HAVE SO FAR SORT OF- INVADED OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFORM AND FIND A NEW WAY. I GUESS I WILL KICK **** AND NOTES THAT- THERE ARE- DIRECTED MISSIONS- REGULATORY OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATIONARY SOURCES- AND- AND I KNOW SOME OF THE- AT REGIONAL AIR DISTRICTS HAVE. ADOPTED NEW RULES- FOR INSTANCE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT- AND- IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIES LIKE A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD TO. DRIVE INNOVATION AND DEVELOP RENEWABLE FUELS THAT REDUCE. EMISSIONS IN SECTORS THAT ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY. I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE- BUT YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO BE CLEAR EYED ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT. PARTICULAR USES AND INDUSTRIAL PROCESS SEES THAT- ARE GOING TO NEED. MORE WORK AND MORE INNOVATION AND I THINK WE- ARE. TRYING TO DRIVE THAT NOT JUST THROUGH- CAP AND TRADE BUT- THREE WELL CSS- AND THROUGH RESEARCH AND OTHER STRATEGIES. TO- THAT TO BRING THE LOCAL- AND ZERO CARBON STRATEGIES TO THOSE SECTORS. THANKS FOR THAT- I GUESS I WANT TO CONCLUDE JUST BY BRIEFLY- CALLING ON OUR MAC. MEMBERS HERE- ANY ANY COMMENTS OR FROM FROM- LA- ACTUALLY I'D INVITE BUT JUST TO. ON ON SORT OF TRAJECTORIES HERE AND WHAT YOU ALL ANTICIPATE HAPPENING WITH THE CURRENT MIXES STRATEGIES YOU SEE OUT THERE SORT OF- HOW THAT COULD AFFECT. HOW MUCH WE LEAN ON CAP AND% TRADE TO GET US TO TWENTY THIRTY DO YOU SEE THIS BEING STILL OF A BACKSTOP IN SORT OF AN INSURANCE POLICY. TO HAVE A SORT OF PRICE SIGNAL TO DEAL WITH LOW YOU KNOW THE SORT OF LOW COST EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ARE DO YOU- BUT AT ITS CURRENT TRAJECTORY DO YOU SEE IT BEING SORT OF- THE- LYNCH PIN- THE BACKBONE OF THE PROGRAM THAT SORT OF WORK COURSE OF THE PROGRAM. ANY PERSPECTIVE JUST ON. ON THAT- YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF RANGE OF POLICY CHOICES WERE WERE POSITIVE INHERENTLY MAKING RIGHT NOW. OCTOBER TALK. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR. SURE BEYOND OUR PORTFOLIO TO OFFER QUITE THE TYPE OF THE SWEEPING ASSESSMENT AND I WOULD DEFER TO. SECRETARY RUMSFELD AND CHARITABLE FOR THEIR OPINION BUT I DO HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THIS EVIDENCE WHICH WILL PRIMARILY A PERSONAL OPINION MORE THAN THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THE COVERED MARKET CONTINUES TO AS I SAID EARLIER CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A DEEP GOLD- CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION BEHIND. ELEMENT OF THE OVERALL STATES CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO THAT BRINGS AN ELEMENT OF COST EFFECTIVENESS. HELP US. I TRIPLE HOLDER AND- A PRO TO INTEGRATE ALL THE VARIOUS. OF REGULATIONS MEASURES ARE BEING LOOKED OUT FOR PROMOTING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT SUCH A- WHETHER A PROVIDE A BACKSTOP I. DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A BACKSTOP FOR THE STAGE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS BECAUSE OF THE COVERAGE ONLY 75% OF THOSE AND SECONDLY BECAUSE OF THE- AMPLE ALLOWANCES IN THE BANK ALL RIGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO. PROVIDE A BACKSTOP ALL FOR THE OVERALL FOR THE STATE'S OVERALL PERFORMANCE HOWEVER IT DOES PREVENT BACKSLIDING. BY MAINTAINING- OF A MODEST CARBON PRICE IN THE IN THE PROGRAM AND GOING FORWARD MY G. YOU KNOW MY PROFESSIONAL THE REAL STEP WHAT REALLY HAS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO DRIVE CHANGES IN THE HARD TRUTH IS A SO CALLED HARD TO OBEY TRACTORS ARE NOT EVEN INCLUDES TRANSPORTATION OF COURSE. BUT ESPECIALLY INDUSTRY IS. REALLY PRIVATE INVESTMENT I MEAN PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT IT IS ONLY USEFUL ULTIMATELY AFFECT LEVERAGES MANY FOLD MORE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AND RE DIRECT THOUGHT PRIVATE SECTOR DRUNK AND BACKS. AWAY FROM WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWHERE IN ANY WAY INTO CLEAN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENERGY TRANSFORMATION THAT WE NEED SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE POLICIES IN ADDITION TO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A STRENGTHENING OF THE CARBON. MARKET AND A STRENGTHENING OF THE CARBON PRICE. I SHOULD THAT THERE ARE POLICY WHAT SURE. MAY BELOW CARB STANDARD IS A- IS A REALLY PROBLEMS TEMPLE THAT COULD. USED AS A TERM AS A BUY. CENTER CHURCH FOR STANDARD THE LOOK AT A MATCH OR OTHER ADULT SECTOR. BECAUSE IT IS A REMARKABLE ATTRIBUTE OF THESE OF THIS KIND OF TRAVEL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IS IT REALLY DRIVES INNOVATION AND REALLY DRIVES INVESTMENT IN THE SECTOR IS WORTH HAVING A RELATIVELY MODEST EFFECT. ON OUR CONSUMER PRICES DOWNSTREAM. SO IT'S NOT THE HOLY GRAIL TUNA CONOCE CARBON PRICING IS THE HOLY GRAIL BUT IT COMES WITH ITS OWN LIMITATIONS AND SO I THINK. THE IDEA OF HOLISTICALLY LOOKING AT INTEGRATING THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLICY PROPOSALS. SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE A R. B. TO BE DIRECT. DR CONCORD WAS REFLECTING LISTENING TO SECRETARY BLUMENFELD TOUT THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP ESPECIALLY IN BUDGET MATTERS ENSURE RANDALL'S VIEWS ONTHE STATE'S LEADERSHIP IN THE ENERGY SECTORS. I THINK THERE'S A GREAT DEAL TO BE PROUD OF AND TO BRAG ABOUT TO THE WORLD. I THINK IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE EXPERIENCE OF REAL CLIMATE LEADERS IT'S USUALLY SECTOR SPECIFIC POLICIES AND INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY THAT GETS A LOT OF THE WORK DONE AND I CELEBRATE. EVERYONE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THAT FIELD HERE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA FIND THE CAP AND TRADE. IS GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY WAY TO GET THINGS DONE I THINK THEY'RE STRONG ECONOMIC RATIONALES TO MAKE AS MUCH OF IT IS WE CAN. HAPPEN AND I JOINED ALLISON IS VERY THOUGHTFUL REMARKS ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM WORLD DANCING RISE WE HAVE THE SCOPE AND PLAN THAT SAYS MOST OF THE WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE MY CAP AND TRADE. WE DO NOT HAVE A CAP TRADE PROGRAM THAT'S CAPABLE OF DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. AND THE POLITICS OF REFORMING THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT. SO I WELCOME ANY DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT STRENGTHENING OUR BUDGET MEASURES BETTER PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ABOUT OUR INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY ABOUT EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED ALL OF IT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A REALISTIC LOOK THE MOST AMBITIOUS CARBON PRICING JURISDICTIONS IN THE WORLD LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH HAVE PRICES FOUR TIMES OURS. ARE STILL RELYING VERY HEAVILY ON INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY AND THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT WE LEAD AND SUCCEED. HOPEFULLY WE DO IT ALL TOGETHER AND THE THING THAT I THINK JUST. KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS WE CAN'T HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS WORKING AND THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE I STARTED WORKING ON THE SYSTEM. MANY MANY YEARS AGO- RANDOLPH- I'LL JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS- FIRST- YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- CAP AND TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN OUR PORTFOLIO WE HAVE A RANGE OF REGULATORY- IN SENATE REGULATORY PROGRAMS INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAMS CAP AND TRADE ALL OF THEM CREATE- A SUITE OF STRATEGIES TO GET TO OUR GOALS AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY EARLIER YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH SENATOR DOLLY ABOUT THAT TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS PRESCRIBED BY AB THREE NINETY EIGHT IS WHAT EXPIRES IN TWENTY THIRTY- BUT WE STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM UNDER AB THIRTY TWO AND SO THAT IS WHY THE SCOPING PLAN IN ITS ANALYSIS- WILL- ASSUME THAT A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CONTINUES- THE ON TWENTY THIRTY INTO- OUR GOALS FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND- AND THEN I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW. HE THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH- THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WILL AND BE EXPECTED TO DO THIS LIFTING TO TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND WILL BE PART OF THE ANALYSIS IN THIS CAMPAIGN PLAN- AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER AND ASSESSING WHAT THE RULE OF CAP AND TRADE WILL BE AND- YOU KNOW WE ABSOLUTELY GET ADVOCACY ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS ISSUE RIGHT WE GET ADVOCACY THAT. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SHOULD PLAY A LARGER ROLE AND- AND IT AND IT CAN PROVIDE MORE COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS WE GET ADVOCACY N THE OTHER SIDE THAT- IT SHOULD NOT PLAY A LARGE ROLE- AND THAT- A MARKET BASED PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE A LESSER ROLE AND DIRECT AND- EMISSIONS REGULATIONS. SHOULD HAVE A GREATER ROLE- AND THE ISSUES WILL ON A AND- IN THE SKY PLANNING WILL WE WILL A FULL PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS. PLAN ITSELF AND IMPORTANTLY- WHEN THAT IS DONE WE WILL HAVE A FULL. REGULATORY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS AND WE WILL TACKLE- AND THESE. THESE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES- THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IT TODAY'S HEARING SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. MR BROWN. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO OFFER I GUESS MY TWO CENTS ON THE CENTER'S QUESTIONS- I MEAN I THINK- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY DESIGNS. IT'S JUST NOT DESIGNED TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT THE STATE NEEDS IT'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS NOT SORT OF I THINK A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING- SO FAR HERE TODAY- AND SO. THERE'S A VERY REAL RESPECT SORT OF UNDER THE CURRENT DESIGN IT'S JUST NOT NOT GOING TO KIND OF PROVIDE THAT INSURANCE ASSURANCE AND SO THE KEY QUESTION I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE OVERALL IS WHAT TYPE OF ROLE IS AT ONCE- THE ROUTE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO PLAY. GOING FORWARD- I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. THERE IS JUST A VERY STRONG- RATIONALE FOR CONCENTRATING ON THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. ROACH STREET. AND BY OF THOSE COSTS ARE CAN BE VERY VISIBLE AND WE TALKED ABOUT KIND OF SHELL GASOLINE PRICES AND OTHER THINGS. LIKE THAT- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OVERALL COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER PROGRAMS WE DO THINK THAT THERE PROBABLY LESS THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT THERE'S- A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS OF WHETHER SOCIAL LAUGHED AWAY AND THINKING ABOUT. HOW MUCH THE WAY KIND OF THAT. SORT OF COST EFFECTIVE OVERALL. CONSIDERATIONS WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE- BENEFITS AND HOW THOSE COSTS ARE DISTRIBUTED WHAT KIND OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT WHAT ROLE IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE PROGRAM. TO PLAY AND I DID JUST WANT TO KNOW AND ONE OTHER THING AND THAT. IN THE CONVERSATION AROUND INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR INCLUDES. TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR KIND OF A NEW INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION PROGRAMME AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION I THINK IN LARGE PART TO. EXPLORE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES IN THAT AREA GIVE AND I THINK A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND KIND OF WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE IN THAT AREA SO- I THINK OVERALL I THINK THAT'S A- REASONABLE. ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE TO PLAY THAT KIND OF TRY TO EXPLORE AND PILOT AND TEST AND DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THOSE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THOSE AREAS- WHERE THE SOLUTIONS ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND SO I DID JUST WANT TO KIND OF. KNOW THAT AS A AS A KIND OF ANOTHER PIECE OF THAT THE STRATEGY THAT MIGHT WORK IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER ROLE COUNTRY. PROGRAM A COUNTRY PLACE. THANK FOR THANKS TO EVERYBODY THANK YOU MISS CHAIRMAN. THAT COME. TEXT ALL RIGHT- WELL. THAT I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE. ON WHETHER THINGS ARE RIGHT OR LEGAL OR IF WE'RE- DOING. ENOUGH- D. THE IDEA OF ROLLING OVER THE ALLOWANCES WAS A BIG. BIG PROBLEM IN THE EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE YOU KNOW THAT WAS A POLICY DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE SECRETARY AND THE CHAIR INHERITED DEBT BUT THIS IS NOT A NEW DEBATE THAT'S COME OUT WITH THE WITH THE- IRAQ REPORT AND- I WAS HERE WHEN THAT HEARING I WAS. I CONDUCTED THE HEARING FOR GOD SAKES ON THE APPROVAL AND WE WILL THE REPRESENTATIONS WITH THAT- AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT MAYBE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- ALLOWANCES AND NOW WE COME TO LEARN THAT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ALLOWANCES. BUT THERE ARE TWENTY ONE MILLION ALLOWANCES SO THIS I. MAC REPORT AGAIN RAISES HIS CONCERN THAT THE CAP IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS NOT STRINGENT ENOUGH INTEREST RESULTED IT'S NOT GOING TO DRIVE THOSE- THOSE SCHOOLS WE'VE HEARD THE CHAIR AND SECRETARY SAY WERE TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE SCOPING PLANNING AND GET A REPORT NEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. GOOD LOOKING ALLOWANCES FOR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT MAY BE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEY'LL BE SOME RULE MAKING. IT'LL COME UP. I GUESS THE- IS THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY SUBSTANTIAL. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE RECOGNITION BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT IT'S A PROBLEM. WE WERE WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT WE ACCEPT THE REPORT BUT- DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT THERE'S A SIXTY- SIGNIFICANT RISK. THAT THE PROGRAM'S NOT TRICK STRINGENT ENOUGH. BECAUSE ECRETARY WHAT WE START OFF WITH YOU. LET ME ALONE SPANKING IT FESTIVAL ACT SENATOR THANK YOU FEEL TO NASA DAY ON THIS AND OTHER ISSUES I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'VE HAD- AND I'D REITERATE AS IT RELATES TO THE ALLOWANCES- IS. THAT SADLY- J. RANDOLPH AND I. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK INTO AND THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO UNDERSTAND ONCE. WE HAVE COMPLETED THE SCOPING PLAN M. AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THAT ECONOMIC TRAJECTORIES- OUR COVERAGE AND HOW THAT IMPACTS THE MISSIONS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND GET BACK TO THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS- CHAIR RANDOLPH WENT THROUGH AND THEN GET DETAIL ON THAT POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AND- THE DIFFERENT- REDUCTIONS- FROM EIGHT TO FULL. HELLO ALL THE OTHER WAY RATHER THAN THE FULL PERCENT REDUCTIONS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY- SEEING AS A RESULT OF- EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT- SO. WE YOU KNOW THE FROM AN ECONOMIC AND I THINK THAT YOU BUT TROLL DESCRIBE THIS AND MAYBE WILL DO SO AGAIN. IT IS HARD TO TELL IS IT TOO BIG EITHER TOO MANY OTHER TWO TWO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ABILITY TO PINPOINT THAT- CHAIR LIKE HOW SKI AND SO. I THINK WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS- YES. WHERE WE LOOKING AT THIS WITH THAT TENSION BUT I THINK IT THE STATUS AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE I MAC AND YOU. SO INTENDING TO LIFT IT UP AND GIVE IT THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES AT THE MOMENT I DON'T THINK I'M- RIGHT A PLACE WHERE WE SAY WE NEED TO TAKE. AND WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION ACTION TO JUST SIMPLY CHANGE THINGS YOU KNOW THE PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES LAST LOOKING HOST. SCOPING PLAN- AND THE ALLOWANCES AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT. MAY NEED TO BE DONE AND THEN COMING. TO YOU AFTER DOING A PUBLIC PROCESS- THROUGH COBB. THAT WOULD- LOOK AT. POTENTIAL INTENT I JUST CHECKS. THAT COULD. BE ADOPTED BY YOU- AND THE LEGISLATURE I'M SORRY. CURRENT OFFER GUESS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT METRICS DO YOU USE WHEN YOU DETERMINE I WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM. OUR ESTEEMED SCHOLARS WHAT METRICS DO YOU USE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY WHAT'S THE RUSH WHAT'S THE RIGHT FIX AND WHAT WE JUST CONTINUE. AND WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE YEARS OF POLLUTION IN THEN. BANKED ALLOWANCES. WHAT CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. YEAH I MEAN I GUESS I WOULD START OFF pBY SAYING- THAT DOES ALL- IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THE INVENTORY AND UNDERSTANDING ARE WE SEEING REDUCTIONS HAPPEN- AND WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THAT EVERY YEAR AND ASSESS YOU KNOW ARE WE REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- AND AT THIS TIME THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES- AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES AS I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION- IN TERMS OF THE SELF RATCHETING MECHANISM- AND REMOVING ALLOWANCES FROM GENERAL CIRCULATION. PER AT EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT- AND- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS- THIS PROGRAM THAT LITERALLY STARTED ONE YEAR AGO IN THE SENSE OF HOW IT IS CURRENTLY. STRUCTURED AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND- TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW THE CURRENT- ALLOWANCES AND THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND ASSESS- YOU KNOW. AS I ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO SEE A STEADYING A STEADILY INCREASING- HIGH SIGNAL I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT VALID CONCERNS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND EXAMINE- BUT I THINK IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE MORE RECENTLY ARE PLAYING OUT- IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WITH REGARD TO OUR OVERALL EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGY IN THE SCOPING PLAN. AND YOU KNOW IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT A MARKET BASED PROGRAM NEEDS TO SEND SOME CONSISTENT SIGNALS TO THE MARKET- AS- YOU KNOW AS AS DALLAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE IDEA OF SORT OF. PLANNED SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM REVIEWS WHERE YOU ARE ASSESSING YOUR PROGRAM AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED TO- TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE PART OF A ROBUST CONVERSATIONS AND IT NEEDS TO. NOT NECESSARILY BE. SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE YEAR OR OR MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IS NECESSARY SO I THINK YOU'RE HEARING BOTH FROM MYSELF AND SECRETARY BLUMENFELD- ANY INTEREST IN DIVING DEEPER INTO THIS QUESTION. UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE- WITH THE ROLE OF THE BANK ALLOWANCES AND WHAT EFFECT IT CAN HAVE ON THE ON THE PROGRAM BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT. AFTER WE ASSESS WHAT WE EXPECT FROM CAP AND TRADE AS A PART OF OUR LARGER STRATEGY- AND THEN WORK BEGIN WORKING THAT PUBLIC PROCESS AFTER THIS COPING PLAN IS ADOPTED- IN TERMS OF OUR- TYPICAL PRE REGULATORY WORKSHOPS AND DISCUSSION. WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO GET FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION- AND YOU KNOW ADVOCACY FROM ALL. INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND- HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT YOU MIGHT BE WAITING TOO LONG SO THAT THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO. TO MEET OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS. A REDUCTION REDUCTION SHOULD STEP DOESN'T CONCERN YOU WITH ALL THE URGENCY. I HATE YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE HAVE- MADE RECENT REDUCTIONS I THINK THAT- THERE IS. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ASSESS THOSE THOSE RECENT REDUCTIONS AND HOW AND WHAT THE EFFECT THOSE HAVE- AND I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO INGEST- BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY AND GOING FORWARD- IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT THAT'S NEEDED AND NECESSARY- AND SO I DO THINK THAT WE CAN- CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TO TILT TOWARDS OUR GOALS WHILE WE UNDERSTAND- WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN MAKE. EVEN BETTER PROGRESS. DR CONVERGING AT YOUR HAND UP FOR SECOND. YEAH I JUST I WANTED TO CHIME IN BECAUSE I FIRST SAW THIS IS A VERY NASTY PROBLEM THAT OUR POLICY MAKERS OF INHERITED- S. AND I WANT TO READ A KNOWLEDGE AS SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN CRITICAL OF THE PROGRAM AND HE THINKS THERE'S A NEED TO REFORM IF EVERY POLICY MAKER THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRO TEM SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY SAID YOU'RE IN CHARGE GO FIGURE IT OUT. THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS CONDUCT A SERIOUS ANALYTICAL EXERCISE S. IS BEEN PROMISED IN THIS COUPLE AND WE'VE NOT YET SEEN WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE BETTER IT'S BEEN ABOUT THE PROMISE TONIGHT I DO APPRECIATE THAT. THE TENSION THAT I HAVE BEEN IN A KNOWLEDGE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING THAT ANALYSIS AND DOING THAT RIGHT IS THAT YOU KNOW AIR B. DID AN ANALYSIS OF ITS CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WITH ALL OF THESE POST TWENTY TWENTY FEATURES AND IT SAID YOU WERE FINE IF THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ALLOWANCES BANKED. LOOKING AT EXACTLY THESE FEATURES AND I MENTION THIS NOT NOT. TO GET INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT ANY OF THIS BUT- WE THINGS ARE WORSE THAN THAN WERE ANTICIPATED IN THAT ROLE MAKING IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE IT'S LIKE TWICE THE LEVEL. THAT WAS ANTICIPATED- SO I GET A LITTLE SENSITIVE WHEN PEOPLE START SAYING ALL BUT THE PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT NOW WE KNOW WHAT THE PROGRAM HAS LOOKED LIKE SINCE MID TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND EVERY TRADER WHO PLACES A BET EVERY PERCH IN PERSON WHO PURCHASES THAT AUCTION. KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THOSE RULES ARE THERE'S NOTHING NEW WE'RE LEARNING. SO THAT THE TENSION I WANT TO SERVICE HERE IS THAT. IF WE ARE GONNA HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS A LITTLE LATER. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE SORT OF TRUST WITH THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE BECAUSE WE HAD A KNOCK DOWN DRAG OUT ABOUT THIS FOUR YEARS AGO. AND WE LOST YOU KNOW FOR FIVE YEARS OF CLIMATE PROGRESS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT AGAIN. AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD SAY HERE'S THE PERFECT STRATEGY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE EXACT PROCESS THAT. I'VE HEARD THE CHAIRMAN THE SECRETARY ADVOCATE SO- THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT AS WELL AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONFLICTED ABOUT HIS ID. THERE ARE NO MAGIC LEVERS TO PULL WORK POLICY STRATEGIES TO JUST MAGICALLY IMPLEMENT. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL THE STUFF AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO BE ACCURATE ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S THE PART THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND I JUST INCLUDING WITH THE CHAIR. I MEAN IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AND THAT'S NOT A COMMENT ON YOUR CURRENT LEADERSHIP BUT IT'S A HISTORICAL PROBLEM THAT TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH. THIS AND I'M JUST BEGGING. FOR GOING TO WAIT CAN WE. PLEASE SPEAK OPENLY. YEAH THERE ARE SOME. THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN HAS BEEN. A CARB SAID A GENERAL DISMISSIVE NESS ABOUT- POINTS TO THE PRINT RACE WHETHER IT WAS THE- BRIAN- NO VICKY. HIS RESIGNATION LETTER THAT WHEN HE LEFT THE STATE AS A DIRECTOR OF. THE STATE HI CLIMATE POLICY THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY HE SERVED ON THE PROTOCOL THE OFFSET- COMPLIANCE BY TASK FORCE WITH CARBON HE PROTESTED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. I KNOW THAT IT WHEN KERR WAS ASKED BY THE LA- TIMES ON THIRD SCOTT ON ABOUT THE OFFSET PROGRAMS THEY SAID THE PROGRAM WORKED EXACTLY AS WE EXPECTED THERE'S NOTHING. ON TOWARD THERE'S NO QUESTION OF ITS LEGITIMACY I KNOW THE SENATE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHETHER TO RESCIND THE FLOOR PRICE ADDRESSING A PRICE COLOR DEVELOPING ANNUAL BANKING METRICS TO MEASURE ALLOWANCES AN OFFSET HOLDINGS IN PRIVATE. AND GOVERNMENTAL HOLDINGS IN RESERVE ACCOUNTS DEVELOPING RULEMAKING APPROACHES FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ALLOWANCE SUPPLIES ON AN AUTUMN MATIC BASES THAT CAN BE ANTICIPATED BY THE MARKET SO THE MARKET KNOWS IT'S GOOD TO GO BUT DEVELOPING A METHOD FOR CALCULATING AND USE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF EACH COMPLIANCE PERIODS AND WELL IN ADVANCE OF THIS. OF THIS AND- THE THERE THE RAYS THEIR BUT IT SEEMS THAT CARB. SAYS WE'RE SEEING THE- THIS IS WHAT'S LEGAL THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND- I HOPE. THAT THE BOARD TAKES THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE IRAQ TO HEART AND LOOKS AT SOME OF THESE THESE QUESTIONS- REPORT IT TO MY NEXT QUESTION I. WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE SECRETARY BLOOM FELT. HM I GUESS HE AND MEMBERS- WE NEED AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE AND THEN THERE THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN WE WELCOME THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT THEM TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE TO REMEMBER COMING WORDS. POINTS LIKE WE ADD TO THE EXTENT THAT HAS BEEN TIMES HISTORICALLY WHERE THERE IS- JUST A KNOWLEDGE IS THAT I FEEL AND JAY RANDOLPH- CAN SPEAK TO THIS MAYBE WE WE'VE COME INTO. A HOST EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WILD WHERE PEOPLE FELT FRUSTRATED WITH THAT PROCESS PEOPLE FELL I'M EXHAUSTED I'M A JOB IS TO COLLECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED IT AND TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT. WHERE THERE IS A NEED TO RECALIBRATE AND FINE TUNE IT THAT WE DO AND WE INCREDIBLY SINCERE. IN OUR WELCOMED US AND OPENNESS TO HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY VIEWS ABOUT WHEN WE GET A REPORT- YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE CLARITY THAT YOU PROVIDED AROUND ALLOWANCES AND THAT. THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION BANKS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND I THINK BOTH CHAIR ROUND UP FOR MYSELF- HAVE COMMITTED- POST GETTING THE MID MARCH TWENTY THIRD RD MODELING AND SCENARIO IS TO HAVE A REALLY HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT- WHICH YOU WILL BECAUSE- WHEN I HAD TO DEFEND. A POLICY WHERE THEY HAD TO SUPPORT REDUCTIONS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE THAT ARE EFFICIENT. I'M AND AS DALLAS POINTED OUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT STILL THAT WE CAN DO COST EFFECTIVELY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT. AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO SAY. YOU KNOW IT THIS WAY ALL THE HIGHWAY FACEBOOK ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE FEEL OBLIGATED TO IMPLEMENT THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS AND FOLLOW THE PROCESS THESE- AND AS WE DOES OFFICE. CONSTRUCTIVELY WHAT WITH YOU CHAD AND THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH FIXES. WHERE WE SEE THAT THE NECESSARY SO WE WON- TO SENATOR DASCHLE'S POINT WHERE 1% OF ADMISSIONS- GLOBALLY BUT WE CAN HAVE A BIGGER ROLE IF WE ARE HAVING THIS HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WHAT- AND- IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY. INSTRUCTIVE I'D I'D AND ON. SAYING I THINK THE COMPLEXITY CHAIR WHITE HOUSE GET HAVING SOME OF THESE PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS. IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING EXPECTATIONS UPON WHICH MARKET PARTICIPANTS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE END PRICE VOLATILITY IN OTHER THINGS AND SO. I THINK THE STEPWISE DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE HOW WE HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM IS SOMETHING THAT- SADLY CHAIR RANDOLPH AND I- INCREDIBLY OPEN AND- WILLING TO HAVE AND APPRECIATE THIS BEGINNING OF THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. I WAS YOU KNOW. MAYBE WE GET SOME HELP FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST BECAUSE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON LED BY SENATOR CARLISLE'S EXAMPLE HAS A CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM. NOT A CAP AND TRADE BUT A CAP AND INVEST IN THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF WHAT SEEING CALIFORNIA DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND SEE WHAT THE EUROPEANS ARE DOING. BUT THEY TIE. DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS INTO THE ALLOWANCES AND THEN TO THE OFFSET PROGRAMS YOU DON'T GET TO. USE YOUR OFFSET AND UNLESS YOU MAKE A DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTION. AND THEY'RE FAST THE AIRPORT THERE WAS A SECURE CITY CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD LIKE TO JOIN OUR WESTERN- INITIATIVE. BUT THEY'RE GOOD AT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME RULE MAKING SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS FOR THAT RULE MAKING. AND GIVEN THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE WITH IMAX DOES. YOUR RANDOLPH. DOESN'T DOES THAT OFF. THIS HARMONIZATION OF THE- PROGRAM THE CAL AND PROGRAM OFFERS POP. TO FINE TUNE OUR PROGRAM- WELL I TAKE THINGS- AT FIRST- I'M GONNA GET ME TO GO BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THAT STAY THE COURSE- YOU KNOW TO ME STAY THE COURSE MEANS THAT CAP AND TRADE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY- AROUND REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS. BUT WE WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO ADJUSTING IT WHERE NECESSARY NSX SECRETARY BLUMENFELD INDICATED YOU KNOW WITH A PUBLIC PROCESS IN A STEPWISE FASHION YOU KNOW AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST- WE ARE OPEN TO MODIFYING PROGRAM AS NECESSARY- WITH REGARD TO- WASHINGTON- AND CAME BACK- YOU KNOW OUR PROGRAM IS AS WE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF- PROVISIONS OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT THAT- YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY INDICATE THE STRUCTURE OF OUR PROGRAM- AND THERE ARE. STRATEGIES THAT WASHINGTON HAS DEPLOYED THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN OURS SO FOR INSTANCE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE OFFSETS ARE- ARE CAN BE NO MORE THAN 8% OF COMPLIANCE BUT THEY'RE UNDER THERE- ALLOWANCE CAD WHERE AS WE- IN CALIFORNIA CHOSE A- LOWER LIMIT- FOUR PERCENT- AND- NOT UNDER THE CAT- SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE SAME THINGS LIKE NOT OVER RELYING ON- OFFSETS- SO- I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ARE. CONVERSATIONS WITH WASHINGTON ABOUT WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE- AND WHETHER OR NOT- LINKAGES IN THE PROGRAMS ARE. POSSIBLE- BUT AS- YOU KNOW I JUST GO BY TO THE LEVEL POINT- THAT WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO ADJUSTING OUR PROGRAM BUT THAT% IT JUST NEEDS TO BE- YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON- AT. A CLEAR CLEAR EVIDENCE CLEAR ANALYSIS AND A ROBUST PUBLIC DISCUSSION WHERE ALL POINTS OF VIEW- CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENTED AND CONSIDERED. I WOULD BE A LEO DON'T YOU THINK I MEAN WE HAVE WE SET UP THIS PROGRAM YOU WERE. YOU AROUND THE OLD DAYS- THAT WE HAVE THIS PER PROGRAM WE WANTED TO INVITE OTHER ENTITIES OTHER STATES TO DO YOU DO THIS FREE FLOW. OF TREATING AND REDUCTIONS SO WE WOULD REDUCE ACTUAL MISSION ARE WE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ON NOT- NOT PREPARED. TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT IN AN EXPEDITED WAY- MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK UNFORTUNATELY I. AM NOT. TOO FAMILIAR WITH KIND OF THE DESIGN OF THE WASHINGTON PROGRAM KIND OF EXACTLY ALL THE DIFFERENT FEATURES THAT I KNOW SOME OF THE I DID NOT REPORT- KIND MENTIONS SOME OF THAT OFFSETS FEATURES AND- YOU MENTION IN YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS JUST NOW AS WELL- I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF- COMPLICATED- SET OF ISSUES AROUND SHE KIND OF LINKING TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND DETERMINING SORT OF OUT OF THERE THE PROGRAMS ARE KIND OF DIFFICULT WHEN TECHNICALLY STRINGENT- SO THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO THAT BUT THERE IS ALSO A KIND OF A LOT OF MERIT I THINK TO KIND OF EXPLORING THOSE ISSUES JUST FROM A- KIND OF- DEMONSTRATION PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FOR. JUST LOWER OVERALL COSTS- ACROSS KIND OF ALL JURISDICTIONS AND KIND OF REDUCING EMISSIONS SO OF COURSE I GUESS I'M NOT ABLE TO COMMENT TOO MUCH ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE WASHINGTON PROGRAM AND- AND YOU KNOW HOW IT KIND OF LIKES TO CALIFORNIA AND KIND OF THE PROCESS FOR THAT EXACTLY BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S DEFINITELY KIND OF WORTH- WORTH EXPLORING I THINK IT'S JUST A- TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AT LEAST BASED ON MY FAMILIARITY WITH THE PROCESS OF THEIRS. IT CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED AND A LOT OF IMPORTANT KIND OF CONSIDERATIONS GO INTO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE EQUIVALENT BEFORE THEY KIND OF CONNECT WITH ONE ANOTHER. DR BURCHELL. THANK YOU SAID AND I DO ALL OF. I THINK I'M- OF JUST A COUPLE. THE LOOKING. SINCE I KNOW THEY ARE WENT THROUGH FOR YOU. AND WORKING OUT NEGOTIATIONS WITH QUEBEC AND- IT WAS APPROACHED TO DO THAT THE WAY IT WAS DONE AND- I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT- HOWEVER. I THINK. WE NEED TO. RECOGNIZE I THINK YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE CALIFORNIA STANDS OUT ON A GLOBAL STAGE I DO A LOT OF WORK IN EUROPE I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN ASIA AND I AM. AMAZED AT THE ATTENTION OUT SO DO YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS WITH A HUGE ECONOMY WHAT SHIFT SIX LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ANYWAY BUT THE ATTENTION THE CALIFORNIA DECISIONS ON THIS THIS POLICY DIRECTION BACK IN THE ORDER OF ATTENTION THAT A LOT OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS TAKE COURAGE FROM DECISIONS THE CALIFORNIA MAKES US. I THINK US SENATOR DOLLY SAID EARLIER EARLIER THAT YEAH WE'RE 1% GLOBAL AMBITIONS BUT WE HAVE GREATER THAN THAT INFLUENCE IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO CARBON PRICING AS PART OF A TOLL. ROAD HARBOR. PERFORMANCE LED TO SITUATION GLOBE WORK. WERE ROUGHLY TWO FIVE PER OF. AND ARE NOW CO BY SO TYPE OF CARBON. AND YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED THAT A GREAT PORTION OF THOSE ARE OUT OF CARBON PRICE OR HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OBSERVE IN CALIFORNIA. IT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE BARRIERS TO EXPANDING CARBON PRICING IN CALIFORNIA THERE. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF LEAKAGE BUT LINKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS IS THAT IS THE KEY PIECE TO ADDRESSING THAT LEACH LEAKAGE CHALLENGE LINKING ADDRESSES LEAKAGE. BECAUSE IT BRINGS IN TRUCKS WERE CALLED MARKET ALIGNING CLASS OF CLIMATE POLICY STRINGENCY. POSSIBLY LEAK FORMAL LINKING WITH MARKETS OTHERWISE ALIGNING CLIMATE POLICY GOALS AS WE CAN WITH ORDER BENEFITS STOPPED. BY WITH THAT WITHIN A- SPECIFIC TRADING MARKET. THIS IS PROLIFERATING ACROSS WESTERN STATES WAS MORE MORE INTEREST IN THIS SO I WOULD THINK THAT IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST I THINK IT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR DOCTOR SHOULD DISCUSS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO DOES. THE OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LINKING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS ALIGNING WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS. IN ORDER TO GET A GRIP GROWING SENSE OF MOMENTUM ACROSS ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE WESTERN POWER GRID BUT IN GENERAL ACROSS THE WHOLE NATION OF A CLIMATE MOVEMENT THAT CAN HELP. CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE ITS SPECIFIC GOALS. THANK OF BLOOM- CHAIR RANDOLPH. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON. THIS I'M REPORT THREAT. ABOUT SO. OR REPLACE THE OFFSET PROGRAMS WITH PUBLIC EXPENDITURES I TALKED THE ELIO HAS TALKED ABOUT IT. I HAD A CLIMATE DIVIDEND- MEASURE ONE KID THAT COMPETE WITH AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SO OBVIOUSLY I LOST OUTPUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS- ADDRESSING THESE YOU KNOW MULTI LEVER OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT YOU KNOW- ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MORE IN A COORDINATED WAY. ON THEIR OFFSET PROBE AND YOU WANT TO TALK TO ON. I GUESS I WOULD SAY- I THINK THERE ARE- AS YOU KNOW QUESTIONS ABOUT- USE OF PROCEEDS- FROM THE PROGRAM OR OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCE- AND- YOU KNOW IN MY VIEW THE OFFSET PROGRAM HAS- INSURED. REDUCTIONS AND LEVERAGE THE MARKET- BUT A LOT OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE REALLY KIND OF SQUARELY IN THE IN THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE- IN TERMS OF. HOW WE CHOOSE TO INVEST THE PROCEEDS- AND- AND YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT ARE THE- KIND OF SIDEBOARDS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PUT AROUND THAT- AND WHAT ARE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH- WITH THE- THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS- AND SO I THINK THAT'S- VERY MUCH A- A LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATION THAT'S IMPORTANT HOUSE I GUESS MY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN RATHER ALAN. ANIMATED ABOUT THE INAPPROPRIATENESS OF SAFE DRINKING WATER COMING OUT OF THE CAP AND TRADE I'M CONCERNED WITH AB SIX ONE SEVEN WHICHI BELIEVE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH A HUMAN SERVICES A- GOOD GOVERNMENT. IN AN AIR QUALITY PROGRAM BUT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE BEING ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING US TO TAKE THEM SO WE ADDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS AND THAT'S THE BUDGET THAT WAS GIVEN TO US IN JANUARY THEY'RE NOT ASKING TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES DEAR BORDER ST ALL THE SICK AT ALL ON THE CAP AND TRADE IT FOR AT LEAST ONE. SIX ONE SEVEN AND THE- SAFE DRINKING WATER SO LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE THE MAY REVISE IN THE THINKING THAT MIGHT COUPLE THESE YOU KNOW ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY- EMISSIONS MITIGATION ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN A COORDINATED WAY WITH THE WITH THE PROCEEDS. I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE FORCE OFFSETS IN PARTICULAR THE I. MAC REPORTS SPENDS QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT I'VE SPOTS I. DID OUR PANEL WITH THEIR- WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR THE LA WATER FROM SEPT TO FIRST TALKED ABOUT BPF ENERGY BUYING ANY RANCH IN MENDOCINO COUNTY AND CARBON CREDITS WERE OFFSET BY THEIR ADMISSIONS AT THE OIL REFINERY- WE ALL KNOW THAT IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE GETTY RANCH BASICALLY BURNED DOWN IN NEARLY ALL THE PLANNED CARBON CREDITS WERE RENDERED USELESS HOWEVER MONTHS LATER. TO YOUR BOARD ALLOWED THE OPERATION TO SELL THOSE CREDITS TO POLLUTERS BASED ON THE DECISION THAT THE STATE OF THE RANCH BEFORE THE FIRE. EVERYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN AT AT EIGHTIES RANCH WAS PERMITTED UNDER THE RULES INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE ASSETS ON THE LAND SO THE QUESTION COMES IN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THE TRANSACTION WAS LEGAL DO YOU THINK IT WAS WRONG. SECRETARY AND CHAIR DO YOU THINK THE BUYER ACTUALLY RECEIVE WHAT IT WAS AGREED TO BY. OKAY I WILL I'LL TAKE THIS- THIS ONE INDEED- YOU KNOW THE PROCESS FOR HAVING A APPROVING AN OFFSET PROTOCOL IS VERY COMPLEX TAKES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND INCLUDES- AS I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION IT INCLUDES- THE ADDITIONAL- REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BUFFER POOL- AND SO YOU KNOW WE THE QUESTION OF- HOW PARTICULAR OR ISSUES RELATED TO PARTICULAR PROTOCOL APPROVALS- AND- AND HOW THAT- HOW THOSE PLAY OUT. ARE ALL SORT OF PART OF THESE TECHNICAL- CONSIDERATIONS IN THE IN THE OFFSET PROGRAM AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY PRESENTATION I HAVE ASKED STAFF TO- TAKE A LOOK AT SETTING UP A PUBLIC WORKSHOP- AND DIVING INTO SOME OF THESE DESIGN ELEMENTS WITH REGARD TO- TO THE OFFSET PROTOCOLS- AND I WILL SAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN- AREAS WHERE- REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THE SAME INFORMATION AND DISAGREE- AND DRAW. DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS- IN TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE OF THE PROTOCOL APPROVAL PROCESS- AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE THERE WAS ROBUST DEBATE AT THE TIME- THAT- FORESTRY PROTOCOLS WERE APPROVED ABOUT HOW TO CONSIDER THINGS- SUCH AS ADDITIONALITY AND PERMANENCE AND OTHER ISSUES- WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE A OF A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WE NEED TO REVISIT ANY OF THOSE- FACTORS AND I THINK THAT WILL BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION- IN THE END THE WORKSHOP PROCESS THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO KICK OFF LATER. THIS YEAR- BUT AT YOU KNOW AT. I THINK WE NEED TO- BE OPEN TO HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE A POINT AT WHICH WE DISAGREE- AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE BEING. DISHONEST IT MEANS THAT WE ARE SIMPLY. LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA AND DISAGREEING WITH THE POLICY APPROACHES THAT ARE CHOSEN I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TRANSACTION WAS LEGAL YOU KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF LAWYERS ON THE SCREEN HERE IN IN THE AUDIENCE THERE I'M JUST IT'S THAT THE IDEA THAT THIS TYPE OF. TRANSACTION NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN NO IT'S NICE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROTOCOLS IT'S NICE TALK ABOUT PRICES BUT- YOU KNOW I'VE- BEEN TO. SOME PEOPLE NOTED TO SOMETIMES I GET ANIMATED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET CREDITS FOR BIRD TELL FORESTS. IN THE END THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY READ OVERALL REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE SO I HOPE THAT. THE MESSAGES IS GET THAT AT LEAST THIS LEGISLATOR WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IT'S WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THIS. IF THIS ENDS NOW THAT'S NOT WHAT EVER LOOPHOLE THAT SOMEBODY THOUGHT THAT THEY. BARGAINED FOR THAT IS. WELL AT IT SHOULD SHOULD IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN THAT'S I DON'T I DON'T MEAN TO A- PETER IT. MMHM. OKAY TO DEATH. ON THE ON MY MAC REPORT. HOW DO YOU INVITATION THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY BE MADE WITH MADE BEING A DRESS DURING THE SCOPING PROCESS HOW WOULD THAT HOW HOW'S THAT COULD BE LAID OUT WE HAVE THE REPORT WE'VE RATED HOW WITH THAT PRESENTATION WORK OUT AND THEN I'LL GET TO THE I. MECK MEMBERS OF HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT HAD. DEALT WITH BUT I WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU ENVISION WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCOPING PLAN HOW ARE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS GOING TO BE. ADDRESSED WELL I WOULD START WITH THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON- THE SCOPING PLAN ITSELF- AND THEY REQUEST THAT IT ANALYZES THE ON GOING ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE AND- WE ARE DOING THAT- BUT A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REALLY AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER KIND OF MORE- IN IN THIS SPECIFIC REGULATORY DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM- AND SO WE ANTICIPATE- ADDRESSING THOSE- AFTER THE SPENDING PLAN IS COMPLETED AS PART OF THE FREE WORLD MAKING WORKSHOP AS PART OF- AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SUGGESTED BY SECRETARY BLUMENFELD AND- AS PART OF THAT- YOU KNOW DETAIL THE PUBLIC PROCESS- THAT WILL DIVE INTO. SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL- AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM- SOME. YEAH OF DATA THAT- AT IN TERMS OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING. SO FOR INSTANCE ON THIS ASSESSMENTS THAT CARBS SHOULD REVISIT THE DATA AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU SIGNED ON FOR ALLOCATIONS YOU WOULD SCHEDULE PART OF THE HEARING TO LOOK AT THE I MAC REPORT ON THE FREE ALLOCATIONS AND WHAT THAT REGULATORY DESIGN. OR IF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE. IS IT USEFUL AS IT'S STILL LEGITIMATE THAT WHEN YOU HIT THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY USING. WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE I THINK THE- THE PRE REGULATORY WORKSHOP PROCESS CAN BE REALLY USEFUL RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN SET UP A CONVERSATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS YOU KNOW SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE REPORT. AND SET UP PANELS OR OR OR OTHER MEANS TEN TO DIVE INTO. THE PROPOSALS AND HEAR THE PROS AND CONS FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS- ABOUT HOW- WE SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. DR BERTRAM. THE GENERAL THANK YOU'RE GENERALLY I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS THE- THE AND A CONSTIPATED INCLUSION ON THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HELP WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE ROLE OF THE CARBON MARKET COMPLEX- I THINK THAT- SURE RANDALL SENSOR PREVIOUSLY WAS SPOT ON THAT- IT'S THE WORKSHOP PROCESS THAT CAN REALLY HELP FROM THESE IDEAS COME TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THESE IDEAS HAVE TO BE WORKSHOP. ARE THEY THEY ARE NECESSARILY OUT OF THE BOX THE RIGHT WAY TO GO- BUT- THE I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONTRIBUTION TO BEAR ARMS I THINK THAT- ONE SUGGESTION THAT WE HAD THAT WE- THE ON GOING- IDEA OF REGULAR MONITORING OF THE PROGRAMME IN APPROVAL OF THE PROGRAM OVER TIME IS REAL TIGHT BUT BETTER REAL TIME METRICS ALL THE- SIZE OF THE LAWN SPANKING ALONE HOLDINGS TRANSACTIONS THE PRODUCTS CAN BE ACCOMMODATED UNDER PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMPLIANCE ENTITIES. MARKET PARTICIPANTS SO THAT MIGHT FALL IN THE REALM OF A REGULATORY RULEMAKING SO MAYBE IT'S NOT PART OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS BUT IT CAN BE PART OF THE OF THE WORKSHOP AND SPECIFICALLY I'M IT IS PART OF THE SCREEN PLAN PROCESS I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO SEE OR SOME ALTERNATIVE. SCENARIOS THAT. THE A GRAY OR- ROLE. OTHER CAR MARKET LET'S TRY A I MEAN I AM A MODELER AND I HAVE. I'M IMPRESSED DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE AMBITION OF THE SCOPING BOMB PROCESS FROM THE FIRST WHISTLE THAT'S TAKEN AS PART OF THAT- SO I DON'T WANT TO OVER ELSE CAN TERMS OF THE DETAIL WHEN FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED CERTAIN. DECADE IN ANY CASE BUT I DO THINK THAT THE PROCESS SHOULD LOOK AT SCENARIOS WHICH HAVE A GREATER OR LESSER ROLE FOR THE CORPORATE MARKET AND THAT COULD BE RERESENTED THROUGH A GREATER OR LESSER. CARBON PRICE OR- OR- AND I WOULD SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO SEE IF THE MARKET DYNAMICS COULD BE REPRESENTED THROUGH ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY ADJUSTMENT APPROACHES FULL SUCH AS CHANGING THE PRICE FOR OR PRECIOUS MUSCLE ALONE. LIVE BY ADDING ON AN ADDITIONAL PRICE STUFF THINGS LIKE THAT THAT COULD INFORM OF THE OF THE REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I READ YOUR QUOTE IN THE AP ARTICLE LAST WEEK ABOUT- THE SIZE OF THE A LOT OF THE OF THE BANK OF THE ALLOWANCE IN YOUR ID CODE SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE COVERED SOURCES. DON'T REDUCE EMISSIONS AT ALL IN THE COURSE OF THE DECADE COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT IS IT HE SAID. I MEAN THAT'S A REAL CONCERN THAT THERE ARE SO MANY ALLOWANCES AFTER. THAT ALL THE POLLUTERS JUST SIT HERE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT. EIGHT YEARS AND JUST SEND THEM THE ALLOWANCES AND DO NOTHING. HELLO GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WE GET TO IT. TWENTY THIRTY BUT- EXPAND ON THAT. WELL THAT'S EXACTLY I WAS GOING UP FROM THE TRUSTEE THE THEY'RE IN THE BANK FULL FLEDGED. BUT IT DOES. ADD UP TO THE- A- I JUST REQUIRE ISN'T QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT THE- EXPECTED EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM COVERED SOURCES SOURCES ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATE MARKET WHICH ARE 75% OF SOURCES IN THE STATE THAT THEY COULD AT LEAST APPLY AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE- OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE COVER MARKET THEY DON'T HAVE. THAT MEANT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH DOING NOTHING I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WILL HAPPEN THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION POINT AND YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED IT WITH BY MEASURING TWENTY THIRTY I THINK ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD PUT ON THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. AS THE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS WHAT HAPPENS POST TWENTY THIRTY AND YOU ASKED A COUPLE QUESTIONS WE GO WELL WHAT KINDS OF REFORMS MIGHT. HAPPEN THE REALLY HELP PROVIDE GREATER ASSURED US THAT THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND SENATOR STERN ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS I THINK THERE THAT WAS THE NEXT BIG QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE MR MAP. OUT A CARBON AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT DOWN WOULD BE A WITH BANKING ALLOWED OR WHATEVER ONE COULD SEE THESE OTHER CUMULATIVE. ABOUT NUMBER OF TONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE. THE REMAINDER COME FROM A SOURCE IN CALIFORNIA OVER A TWENTY YEAR HORIZON OR WHATEVER YOU SHOULD NOT ZERO BEING. ACHIEVED AND THAT WILL INVOLVE GOING THROUGH THE GATEWAY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN TWENTY THIRTY SO IT COULD BE THAT WE NEED A BANK THAT'S COMPILED SOURCES NEED A BANK. OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF TWENTY THIRTY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT THAT'S YOUR GOAL IN WHICH CASE THEY'LL BE AMPLE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THE STOCKADE. SO THAT THEY CAN PRESERVE THAT BANK AND USE THEM LATER ON IN THE PROCESS WHEN IT BECOMES REALLY. INCREASINGLY AMBITIOUS AND THE AND DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT'S WHAT. A PLANNER CAN'T REALLY KNOW THAT UNTIL THERE'S A FULL VERSION OF TERMSWHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE CLUB POLICY PORTFOLIO FOR THE STATE. SO THAT'S WHAT. I WOULD SORT OF BACK UP SHE WAS A BIG CHALLENGE. THAT IS PICTURE- I ONE MIGHT SUSPECT I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG TIME ON THIS SUBJECT BUT I HAVE GOTTEN THE RED FLAG BECAUSE I NEED TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT SO I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND EDUCATING MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE- ON- ON YOUR VIEWS ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ON THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THE AND THE ROLE- THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR MANY TAKE COULD TAKE IN CALIFORNIA AND MEETING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS- PRODUCTION OUR GOALS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT AFRAID TO WRITE LETTERS SO WE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS THAT WILL PUT OUT AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE A DOCTOR'S COLLINSWORTH AND BURKE TRIAL FOR THE- WONDERFUL REPORTED YOU GUYS THE VISOR COMMITTEE PUT OUT THIS IS THAT. THIS IS THE TYPE OF WORK THAT- DOESN'T GET A LOT OF RECOGNITION SO I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE EFFORT YOU PUT IN AND THE CONSENSUS. THAT IT'S NOT LOST ON THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS IS A CONSENSUS REPORT THAT YOU GUYS ACHIEVE WITH THE ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR ADVISORY GROUP SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT WE WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THANK YOU FOR YOUR- TIME- OKAY D. ANYONE WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN ROOMFORTY TWO OH THREE PLEASE COME FORWARD I SEE THEY'VE WAITED. IN ORDER OUT OF TIME THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD I THANK YOU THAT YOUR ACCOUNT KEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS I'M JOHN BLUE I'M REPRESENTING- THE INTERNATIONAL MISSIONS TRADING ASSOCIATION OR I EVEN TODAY. FIRST OFF I AM HEARTENED THAT WE'RE ALL HERE- IN SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM AND WORKING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MOST MAKE A MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF IT AND TO. ENSURE THAT IT CONTINUES TO OPERATE AND CALIFORNIA- FOR SORRY I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT. CAP AND TRADE IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. MECHANISM AVAILABLE SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS WE DEFINITELY SHOULD BE REMEMBERING THAT. CAN ADDITIONALLY. AS A US MENTIONED THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT BANKING WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS EXTENDED BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE CLARITY AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT- REGULATED ENTITIES WILL KNOW THAT ALL HAVE GOT FURTHER COMPLAINTS. COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND THAT THAT. THAT WOULD SORT OF ELIMINATE THAT POSSIBILITY THAT BANKERS BANK ALLOWS TO BEING DUMPED ON THE MARKET. SO THANK YOU- AND- THAT'S ALL FOR NOW RIGHT- GOOD- PUT NOW IT'S MOVED TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- DURING THE- TELECONFERENCE- PHONE MESSAGES AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPATED. A NUMBER IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE SIX FOUR AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. THIRTY FIVE THIRTY ONE TWO EIGHT THREE- DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING TECH TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING PROTOCOLS I MAY HAVE TO INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS BUT LET'S BEGIN THE HEARING THEM AND WILLING TO TAKE THOSE AT THE TIME A MODERATE IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROF INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- AM. PM THANKS RICHER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO- EXPRESS PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. NINE A. T. T. OPERATOR WILL- GIVE YOUR LINE NUMBER QUICKLY OFF LINE IN PLACE RIGHT BACK IN THE QUEUE. AGAIN FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE OUTLINE TWELVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS MICHELLE FROM OUR LAST I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL TURN BY MARINA. BALANCE OR COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR AND PUBLIC LEADERS HAVE BEEN WORKING. TOGETHER TO ADVANCE STRATEGIES ON A DOWN ECONOMY AND A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. I THINK WE HAVE A PRINCIPAL CONCERN HERE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO RE LITIGATE EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ON ANGLE BASIS. AGAIN PRESENTING IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN FORMALLY REJECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN FAVOR OF POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE COST OF. COMPLIANCE AND THEREFORE-INCREASE THE COST THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THAT TIME WERE EXPERIENCING. PORTABILITY ISSUES ACROSS. THE. ENTIRE ECONOMY- THIRTY TWO AT THE THIRTY TWO. AND EIGHTY THREE EIGHT ALL HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO MINIMIZE COSTS MAXIMIZING BENEFITS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. YOU KNOW CHEATING CAUGHT THE TECHNICIAN REDUCTION AND AGAIN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BALANCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AMBITION WHAT THE IMPACTS TO SOCIETY. BUT AS MENTIONED BY JOHN WOO THE SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THE BANK IS TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM YOUNG TWENTY THIRTEEN WE THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSION. IN AND AROUND CARBON NEUTRALITY THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE THESE DIALOGUES ADDITIONALLY THE SCOPING PLAN IS DOING- BUT MODELING EXERCISE THAT WILL HELP- EDUCATE EVERYONE ON KIND OF THE INFLUENCE AND INTERACTIONS OF THESE PROGRAMS- ARE YOU MACKEY IS INHERENTLY PASSED WITH ANALYZING THE MARKET BUT ALSO ALL RELEVANT CLIMATE POLICIES WE HAVE TO READ VISIBLE CARBON PRICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAP AND TRADE OBVIOUSLY BEING THE LOWEST AROUND TWENTY DOLLARS WE HAVE A CARBON PRICE NOBLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND A VERY HIGH CARBON PRIDE IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. THE AGGREGATE COST CARBON CONSENSUALLY HIGHER THAN THE THAN THE CURRENT CLEARANCE FRAMES OF THE CAP AND TRADE WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND EACH AND EVERY POLICY PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE ALLOWANCE VALUE AWAY FROM THE CAP AND TRADE INTO A WALL HE WOULD SUPPORT CAP AND TRADE BEING THE FOREFRONT AND DRIVER OF MOST THE MEASURE OPTIONS IN THE STATE NEW TO THE LAYERS OF POLICY THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED OVER THE YEARS WE'VE FOUND THAT WE HAVE SUPPRESSED THE PRICE WITHIN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE REMOVED THAT VALUE TO OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT ARE DIRECTLY REGULATING THOSE SOURCES. ADDITIONALLY THE CALLS FOR. YOU ADOPTING. FROM WASH. WE THINK- BUT PREMATURE. HELLO THE MISSIONS OF CONTINUE GOT GO UP- OVER THE YEARS THEY THEIR TWENTY TWENTY WHAT WE ACHIEVED OUR THREE YEARS EARLY MAR ABLE TO RATCHET DOWN TOWARDS OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IN THOSE TIMES WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT STATE HOW THEIR POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED HOW IMPACTED BUSINESSES WHICH ARE ALSO THE STANLEY DIFFERENT THAN CALIFORNIA THEY DON'T HAVE AS A PERSON IN THE COMPANY. NOR DO THEY HAVE THE BITE OR OR SCALE THAT WE DO ENOUGH FOR ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. AND- APPRECIATE TIME THANK YOU. X. WE WILL LIVE FORTY EIGHT YOU ARE OPEN. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DR CATHERINE GROUP ALL RIGHT I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION OR C. BACK AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK THE I. E. R. YEAH I EVEN HAD FOR THEIR REPORT- AND POINT OUT AS MANY. OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO THAT COST EFFECTIVENESS DOES NOT NECESSARILY EQUATE WITH EQUITY OR JUSTICE. I ALSO CAN NOT AGREE WITH CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS AS FAR AS COMMUNITY ENGAGED WE IN FACT HELD OUR FIRST WORKSHOP IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY LAST NIGHT AND HAD MULTIPLE PARTICIPANTS WHO SHARED WITH US BUT THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM US EARLY AND OFTEN IN THE PROCESS. AND UNFORTUNATELY DO THAT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND JUST HELD OUR FIRST WORKSHOP. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF CARDS TWENTY TWENTY TWO COPING PLAN TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND GIVEN THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CARBON MARKET AND MANY COMPANION POLICIES. IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT CARD FURTHER ILLUMINATE EXPECTATION FOR THE MARKET AND QUOTE UNQUOTE HELPS THAT COURSE FOR THE CONTINUING DECARBONIZATION OF CALIFORNIA AS. THE REPORT STATES. CARD CANNOT RELY ON MY A LOW TO. IMAGINE FEUD IT ALSO. A STAFF IMPACT A PROGRAM. ON PEOPLE HELLO. PARTICULARLY BLACK AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR I WOULDN'T SUGGEST ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN. DISCUSSED TODAY ABOUT TOO MANY ALLOWANCES. SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE FORCE OFFSET PROTOCOL AND OVERALL WHILE I APPRECIATE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POTENTIAL REFORMS- THERE WAS A RECENT REPORT FROM DOCTOR MANUEL PASSWORD OTHERS SHOWING THAT EMISSIONS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. MARKET BASED MECHANISMS ARE FATALLY FLAWED AND HAVE TO BE ENDED. OFFSET AND CAP AND TRADE HAVE FURTHER CONCENTRATED POLLUTION IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND WITHOUT PROPER CALIBRATION STRICT CONTROL AND DILIGENT STRINGENT OVERSIGHT THE SYSTEM IS GAINED BY INDUSTRY AND NOW AS THE EMAIL RECORDS INDICATE. POTENTIALLY ALSO OUTSIDE SPECULATORS. BECAUSE CARBS CURRENT APPROACH IS MARKET DRIVEN THE COPING COPING PLAN PRESUPPOSES THAT SOCIAL AND HEALTH COSTS. ARE GOING TO BE EXTERNALIZED INTO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. OFFERING LIKE CAP AND TRADE MUST BE REPLACED BY RECOGNITION REDUCTION WITH PRIORITIZATION FOR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NEIGHBORHOOD. A MEMBER OF THE JACK I REMAIN COMMITTED TO EACH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DIALOGUE. WITH MEMBERS THANK YOU. YOUR NECK- ALLIANCE FOUR OPEN. I IS TONY BURNELL- RIVER THE CALIFORNIA FOREST CARBON COALITION I APPRECIATED- TRYING TO THINK TOO MUCH TIME ONE THING WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS OBVIOUSLY THE FORESTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FIGURING OUT HOW TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE VIRUS AND REALLY LOOK OVER TIME IT AND HOW TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM- ONE THING ALSO. THAT CLEAR IT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR EMISSIONS. FROM FOREST. BUT ONE AREA THAT IS DONE IT REALLY WELL AND THROUGH THE FOREST CARBON PROTOCOL SO. ONE SHOULD LEAVE HIGHLIGHT THAT'S REALLY IT FINDS BASED PROGRAM. SECOND WE REALLY WANT TO TRY AND GET TRIBES AND NONPROFITS AND COMPANIES TO INCENT THEM. TO TRY AND HELP IN THE STATE COVERAGE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR WILDFIRE ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHERE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN DOING THAT. I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE IMAX RECORD IT'S BEEN NICE HI RECORD IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A VOLUNTEER GROUP THAT HAS FIVE MEMBERS I THINK THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB. WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE BALANCE AND SOMETHING THAT WOULD SHOW SOME OF THE BENEFITS. OF PROGRAMS LIKE THE FOREST OFFSET PROGRAM I'M ALSO PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS CRIMINALS YOU KNOW WE REPRESENT A LOT OF THE TRIBES AND- NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN DEVELOPING THESE FOREST OFFSET PROJECTS. COME VISIT COME TALKING FOLKS. REALLY FOLKS ARE NOT OUT THERE YOU KNOW AT ONE POINT INTENDED TO BE CERTAIN THE CRIMINAL WITHOUT LOGGING. IN IN THIS REPORT. AND SO REALLY OUTLINING HOW IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS THAT ACTUALLY COME FROM THESE PROJECTS. WOULD BE EXCEPTIONALLY HELPFUL SO THE LAST THING IS JUST- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE SUMMER TO POTENTIALLY WASTE SOME OF THE. COSTS AND BENEFITS. A BRAND LIKE THE FOUR ALL THAT PROBE. CALL SHOW UP AND TO IN THAT. AND THEN REALLY WOULD LIKE TO AND THINK FIGURE OUT A WAY TO OPEN UP AND CHANGE PROBABLY. THAT SO AGAIN YOU'RE ENCHANTING GOOD PLAYERS TO REDUCE. AND REDUCE TOP QUALIFIER REST THANK YOU BUT THAT THANK YOU NEXT. HELLO LINE FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIFTY TWO.
