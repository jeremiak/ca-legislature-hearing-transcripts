ADMINISTRATOR AND THEIR

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.486
ANALYSIS IN MODESTO IS THAT. A

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.788
WORKER NEEDS TO EARN AT LEAST

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:16.589
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IN

ANYONE EARNING UNDER THAT WHICH

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.965
IS. BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL IS

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.200
FORCED INTO THESE UNTENABLE

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.968
HOUSING SITUATIONS AND THAT

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.169
OBVIOUSLY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.372
WE WANT TO KEEP PERPETUATING SO

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.473
THE GOAL OF THIS IN AN

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.174
INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TO.

OF SKILLED AND TRAINED

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:41.914
WORKFORCE. IT DID TO INQUIRE AS

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.149
TO WHETHER THERE IS A

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:43.716
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBANIZED

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.985
AREAS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. TO

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.820
UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:48.921
BEST PRACTICE MODELS ARE FOR

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.124
PREPARING THE WORK FORCE. AND

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.725
WHAT IS A STATE NEED TO DO TO

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.994
INCENTIVIZE A LONG TERM

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.495
COMMITMENT TO THOSE BEST

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.364
PRACTICES. AND TO MAKE SURE

00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:59.966
THAT WERE PREPARING STUDENTS

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.267
FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE TO

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:04.671

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.305
NEEDED TO HOUSE OUR WORKFORCE

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.574
BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THAT THEN-

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.109
WE'RE GONNA END UP IN A

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.611
SITUATION WHERE WE CONTINUE TO

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.980
SEE HOUSING BE ONE OF OUR

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.048
CRITICAL NUMBER ONE ISSUES AND

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.917
FRANKLY. PEOPLE CAN DISCOVER

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.553
PRETTY QUICKLY THAT- THAT THEY

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.255
MOVE WITH TEIR WITH THEIR FEET

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.289
INDEED THE GO TO OTHER

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.091
COMMUNITIES OTHER PLACES OTHER

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.695
STATES WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.629
TO EARN A LIVING THERE AND

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.797
AFFORD TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.198
HOUSING UNITS THERE AS WELL SO

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.333
OBVIOUSLY NOT IN OUR INTEREST

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.502
TO DO THAT AND SO- THANK YOU

NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR SO IF. WE

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.112

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR NUMBER

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:19.751
ONE PROBLEM TO DATE IS-

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:23.655
SHORTAGES OF LABOR- ACROSS THE

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:26.825

AND ABILITIES. WATER AND ENERGY

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.285
EFFICIENT HOUSING SUPPORTS

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.620
COMFORTABLE AND HEALTHY LIVING

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.555
CONDITIONS AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:47.124
A PRIORITY IN HOUSING PROJECTS

OPPORTUNITIES. ALL OF THESE

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.440
THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:05.509
REQUIRE A WORK FORCE TO BUILD

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:06.043
THIS HEALTHY AND SAFE AND

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.846

EFFICIENCY SAFETY AND

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.885
AFFORDABILITY IS ALSO AN AREA

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:15.519
WHERE THERE IS A WORKFORCE NEED

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.120
IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.489
HAPPEN. BUILDING MORE HOUSING

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.457
ALSO MEANS THAT WE NEED TO

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:20.424
ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.727
CHALLENGES OF UPGRADING AND

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.195
REHABILITATING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.496
THAT SUPPORTS HIGHER DENSITIES

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:27.598
DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. SO FOR

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.934
EXAMPLE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE- SO

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.669
THESE TYPES OF THINGS HAVE HAVE

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:32.636
TO BE UPGRADED IN MANY REGIONS

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.138
OF THE STATE TO MEET DEMANDS OF

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.040
INCREASED CAPACITY BUT ALSO TO

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.875
INCREASE- OR TO MEET THE

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.543
INCREASING EXPECTATIONS OF

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.345
STORM WATER FLOW DO YOU TO SEE

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:44.715
LEVEL RISE OR- ABOVE AVERAGE

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:45.282
RAINFALL EVENTS THAT AFFECT

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.850
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.753
MORE FREQUENTLY. GRAY WATER

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:49.920
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE PIPES TOM

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.455
SWISS REGIMENT PLANS BUT SHOULD

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:52.723
BE COMPLIMENTED WITH THAT GREEN

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.725
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT. SO DO

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.560
YOU KNOW TO IN ORDER TO REDUCE

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:57.528
THAT THE RUNOFF QUANTITY BUT

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.964
ALSO INCREASE WATER QUALITY. SO

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.798
THINGS LIKE GREEN ROOFS BIO

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.700
SWELLS PERMEABLE PAVEMENT

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.468
CONSTRUCTED A RESTORED WETLANDS

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:07.238
OF IN RIPARIAN HABITAT CETERA

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.205
ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN HELP TO

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.473
RELIEVE STRESS ON THE SYMPTOMS

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.242
ARE ON THE SYSTEMS. AND WILL

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:12.910
ALSO SUPPORT THAT ADDITIONAL

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:14.445
HOUSING AND CREATE THOSE

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.613
RESILIENT COMMUNITIES TO

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.515
SUPPORT A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.315
FOR THE WORKERS WHO LIVE N

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:20.551
THOSE COMMUNITIES- SKILLED

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:21.418
WORKERS ARE ALSO NEEDED TO

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:23.154
UPDATE OUR TRANSPORTATION I'M A

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.188
MILK MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.323
ORDER TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW SAFE

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.558
AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.460
OPTIONS. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.328
WHERE- WE ARE WE ARE BUILDING

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:33.831
IT AND DIGITAL HOUSING UNITS

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:34.565
MAKING IT SAFER FOR KIDS TO

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:36.133
WALK TO SCHOOL. FOR PEOPLE TO

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.368
BIKE OR WALK TO WORK IF THEY'RE

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.737
ABLE. AND NOT TO MENTION SAVING

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:40.571
LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.772
TRAVELING ALONG THIS AND SAFE

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:44.108
ROADS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:44.675
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:45.876
SUPPORT ABILITY OTHER THAN

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.912
CARS. THE REASON I MENTION THIS

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.313
IS BECAUSE WHERE WE BUILD

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.447
HOUSING WE HAVE TO ALSO

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.916
CONSIDER THE NEED FOR BUILDING

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:52.917
THIS COMPLETE STREETS AND- BIKE

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:55.219
PATHS BEST RAN BY. PATHWAYS AND

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.555
ACCESS TO LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSIT-

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.356
WE A PARKING RIGHTS THINGS F

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.891
THAT NATURE. REPRESENTING AN

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.893
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT WORKFORCE

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.495
DEVELOPMENT TO HELP US TO REACH

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:05.996
THOSE GOALS AND TO ALSO HELP

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.531
OUR WORKERS. GET TO WORK

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.834
SAFELY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.335
THE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING EACH

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.037
OF THESE ISSUES I'VE MENTIONED

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.305
WILL VARY GREATLY THROUGHOUT

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:16.473
THE STATE. HOUSING IS NEEDED

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.676
ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE STATE.

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.110
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.178
HOUSING THAT IS LOCALLY

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:22.780
APPROPRIATE. AND DOES NOT

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.849
CONTRIBUTE TO DISPLACEMENT AND

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:27.117
ALSO SUPPORTS THE HEALTHY AND

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.052
QUALITY OF WHAT A GOOD QUALITY

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:29.053
OF LIFE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.522
THERE. ONE OF THE NEW NORMALS

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:32.056
THAT MANY COMMUNITIES IN

00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:33.924
CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.960
WITH IS THE NEED TO REBUILD

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.728
AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.296
THE WILD FIRES THAT HAVE TAKEN

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.798
THE LIVES AND HOMES OF OUR

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.967

SEASON THREATENS HOMES AND

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:54.945
COMMUNITIES EVEN TODAY AS WE.

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:55.913
SPEAK AND IN THOSE REGIONS OF

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.547
THE STATE- THAT ARE AFFECTED BY

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.181
THESE HAZARDS THAT ARE FUELED

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.115
BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BUILDERS

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:58.949
ARE BECOMING REBUILDERS. AND

00:41:59.016 --> 00:41:59.617
WITH THESE MORE FREE GET

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:00.251
FREQUENT AND WIDESPREAD NATURAL

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:00.818
DISASTERS WE HAVE TO THINK

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.152
ABOUT REBUILDING WITH THE

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.053
SAFETY AND THE HEALTH OF THE

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.522
SURVIVORS IN MIND. AND THAT

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.458
MEANS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.826
FUTURE THREATS OF NATURAL

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.327
DISASTERS AND RESOURCE

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:13.631
SCARCITY. AND RELIABILITY WHEN

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:14.231
REBUILDING HOMES NEIGHBORHOODS

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.934
AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. THE

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:17.468
STATE CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.702
THROUGH PROCUREMENT BY

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:21.038

THOSE THINGS IN A MATCH UP WITH

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:43.640
A NO THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:44.575
FOR WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:46.910
OUT GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:50.380
BUT THEY DO COME INTO CONFLICT-

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:50.981
BUT EVEN IN ADDITION TO THOSE

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:52.116
THINGS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:53.951
TODAY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SUPPLY

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:56.320
COST PEOPLE HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH

00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:56.920
ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:59.923
ABOUT UTILITY COSTS WE HAVEN'T

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.861
TALKED ABOUT FEES. IT'S GOOD

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:04.895
THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:05.496
ZONING BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.965
HEARING AND I THINK HE WANTED

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:08.499
TO GET INTO THAT TODAY NOT

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:10.367
TODAY. BUT THERE'S SO MANY

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.069
OTHER THINGS OF THAT HAVE HAVE

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:14.071
CREATED THIS NOT THAT WE LIVE

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:14.671
WITH AND TODAY AND- I DO THINK

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:17.341
THAT. AND I KNOW WHAT THE NEXT

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:18.575
FILES GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS A

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:19.376
LITTLE BIT SO I'M LOOKING

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.377
FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.045
THOUGHTS BUT- THAT EDUCATION

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.447
TRAINING REALLY ARE THE KEY. AT

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:24.548
SOME LEVEL IT'S ALL ABOUT

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.216
ECONOMICS AND IT'S ABOUT SUPPLY

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.952
AND DEMAND. AND YOU KNOW I

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:31.255
HEARD I HEARD A FACT- ALLEGEDLY

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.389
A FAX WOULD LIKE TO GET GET

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.824
YOUR REACTIONS TO IT. IS IT

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:39.463
THAT. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE ARE.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.030
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:40.564
APPROVED. HOUSING UNITS IN

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:43.000
CALIFORNIA TODAY. NO WAY OUT.

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:44.968
ZONING ISSUE NO SECRET ISSUE

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:47.237
THESE ARE APPROVED UNITS- AND

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:48.605
THEY'RE NOT BEING BUILT ON AND

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.207
I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT. I

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:53.410
HAVE A NUMBER OF PARCELS THAT

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:53.877
HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:54.912
THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND THEY'RE

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:56.380
NOT GETTING BILLED. SO THEY

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.981
ACQUIRE ASIAN THAT THE THOSE

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.650
LANDOWNERS OUR DEVELOPERS ARE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.818
FACING. THAT INVESTMENT THE

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:04.054
RISKS THE REWARDS JUST NOT

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:04.655
THERE FOR LOTS OF THE REASONS

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:05.789
IN WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE JUST

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.424
CRIED RIGHT. ALTHOUGH THERE

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:08.759
SOME OF THEM ARE IN CONFLICT

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.227
WOULD WE LIKE TO PAY MORE OF

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.762
COURSE. BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT THE

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.397
ISSUE AFFORDABILITY SO THAT

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:14.631
THAT'S THIS NOT THAT WE ARE

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:16.466
LIVING WITHIN WE'D LIKE TO HAVE

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:18.101
EVERYBODY ABSOLUTE REUSS OF

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.771
COURSE. NOW RAISING COSTS. SO

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:22.706
IT IS AN INTERESTING KIND OF

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.208
NOT THAT WE ARE LIVING IN TODAY

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:25.842
AND HOW WE GET OUT OF IT. AND

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.411
GET OUT OF THE BASIC ECONOMICS

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.513
WHICH IS THAT- IF WE DON'T HAVE

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.918
THAT. YEAH THE SUPPLY. IT'S

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:35.552
GOING TO AFFECT THE DEMAND. AND

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.988
VICE VERSA AND SO. I WOULD BE

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:38.956
INTERESTED IN ANY REACTION TO

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:42.926
THE IDEA THAT- IS THE FIVE

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:43.527
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPROVE

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:44.194
UNITS JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT YOU

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:46.363
HAVE SAID. WE'RE NOT PAYING

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.631
ENOUGH. WE'RE NOT HAVING A

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:51.268
SKILLED ENOUGH- WE- THAT THAT

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:52.736
THAT REALLY ALL FEEDS IN THE

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:54.137
SAME PLACE. THAT'S THAT'S

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.173
REALLY THE- THE DILEMMA

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:56.740
QUESTION WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE

00:47:56.807 --> 00:48:04.248
WRESTLING WITH TO. I THINK YOU

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.148
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AS FAR

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:08.418
AS- EXAMINING. THIS ISSUE OR

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.120
THIS DILEMMA IN A HOLISTIC

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:14.558
MANNER OBVIOUSLY. LUXURY AND

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.727
HIGHER AND HOMES ARE BEING

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.528
BUILT BECAUSE THERE'S A MARKET

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:21.465
FOR THEM AND- MORE AFFORDABLE

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:24.468
HOMES ARE UNFORTUNATELY GETTING

00:48:24.534 --> 00:48:26.403
PASSED UP BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.606
PENCIL OUT. THERE ARE. IN MANY

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:34.678
CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE ARE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:40.450
PROJECTS- THAT MEMBER EARLIEST-

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:43.020
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES- ARE

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.122
HAVING TO FOCUS ON ON ONE

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:47.391
SECTOR AND AT THE RISK OR AT

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:52.262
LEAST- JEOPARDIZING OTHERS.

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:55.632
OBVIOUSLY LABOR IS 2025% OF

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:56.466
CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOME AND

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:59.636
THAT'S A HUGE SEGMENT- THERE

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:02.739
ARE- ENTITLEMENT COSTS THERE

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.508
ARE NON UTILITY IMPACT FEES

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:08.245
WHICH CALIFORNIA. TWENTY TWO

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:08.845
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND WHICH IS

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:09.713
TWICE AS MUCH THE TO

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.248
NEIGHBORING STATES. ALL OF

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:15.018
THESE COSTS- ADD UP ON TOP OF

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:17.988
EACH OTHER AND EVERY MONTH WE

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.323
PROBABLY INCREASED BY ABOUT A

00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:21.692
PERCENTAGE POINT- AND THEN YOU.

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:24.361
SNOWBALL THAT INTO TERRACE AND

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:24.861
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ARE

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:30.734
UNCONTROLLABLE. FOR EVERY

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:31.902
THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU INCREASE

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:34.905
THE COST OF A HOME YOU'VE KEPT

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.707
THAT HOME OUT OF REACH FOR

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:40.744
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. AND

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:45.782
WELL THAT'S A PART OF IT. WE

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:49.886
NEED TO LOOK AT A BUILDING

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.755
HOMES AT ALL LEVELS AND ALL

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:55.325
SCALES AND. WHETHER THOSE THOSE

00:49:55.392 --> 00:50:00.097
HOMES ARE. BELOW YOU KNOW 50%

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.899
AM I OR IF THEY'RE ABOVE YOU

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:04.601
KNOW THE YOU KNOW A OR FOR

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.103
INSTANCE HAS GOT A ONE POINT

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.871
THREE MILLION DOLLAR AVERAGE

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:10.240
AVERAGE LUXURY CONDO. YOU HAVE

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.942
THE STILL THE SAME PEOPLE SWING

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:12.676
IN THE HAMMERS AND OPERATING

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:15.212
THE HEAVY MACHINERY. UP AND IN

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.948
LESS WE LOOK AT THIS UPSTREAM

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.250
AND INVEST IN CHANGING THAT

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.586
NARRATIVE IN GETTING KIDS.

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:25.188
EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:27.224
OF A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.793
AGAIN WITHOUT COLLEGE DEBT-

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.229
THEN THESE. PROJECTS ARE GONNA

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:36.099
CONTINUE TO GO. ON BUILT OR

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:39.236
DELAYED ATADDITIONAL COST- IN

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.404
AND THEY'LL JUST BE SITTING

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.573
IDLY- IN MEANWHILE WILL JUST

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.642
BE. WAITING AND HOPING SO I

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:49.312
JUST OFFER THAT. UNLIKE THE

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:50.981
ADELANTO WOOD MISTER CONKLIN-

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.883
THIS SAID ON THEE ARE MANY

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:55.185
FACTORS WERE WHILE OTHERS

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:56.987
PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:57.921
UNITS ARE APPROVED IN AND NOT

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.823
GETTING READY TO BUILD. UP COST

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.491
MAY BE A FACTOR WILL DEFINITELY

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:04.494
SEE THE POINT HAVING ACCESS TO-

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:05.395
A SKILLED LABOR FORCE TO

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:06.830
ACCOMPLISH THE PRODUCT PROJECT

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:09.733
WITH PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.602
CAN ALSO RELATE TO THAT- BUT WE

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:15.038
MISSED ONE POINT AND WHAT YOU

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.506
SAID CENTER AND THAT'S PROFITS.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.508
RIGHT WHOCONTROLS THE PROFITS

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.943
AND THE TIMING OF THE

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.211
CONSTRUCTION ONCE YOU RECEIVE

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:24.681
THE ENTITLEMENT. AND THAT IS A

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.617
KEY COMPONENT OF THIS AND SO WE.

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:28.185
CONTINUE TO STRESS THE FACT

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:28.752
THAT THIS IS A CONGRESS SAID

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.754
THERE IS A LUXURY CONSTRUCTION

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:33.490
A MARKET RATE SORT OF SPEAK

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:34.024
PRODUCTION. OUT THERE BUT

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.326
WHAT'S MISSING IS THAT.

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.295
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE OF THOSE

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:41.164
PROJECTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE IN

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:44.768
NEED OF SUBSIDIES. HAVING A

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:47.204
SORT OF A PUBLIC PRIVATE TYPE

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.338
PARTNERSHIP WITH THERE IS A

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:51.074
PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED LIKE WHAT

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.642
WAS AN ARTY GAZE FOR EXAMPLE A

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.778
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.746
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HAD THE

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.482
WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS ADDRESS

00:51:58.548 --> 00:52:00.884
THAT ISSUE IT DID PROVIDE A LOT

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:01.751
OF UNITS AND PERHAPS THE

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:04.387
INVENTORY TO. BE IN COMPETITION

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:05.856
SOME OF THOSE HOMES WITH PRICE

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:08.592
ABILITIES WERE ALSO THERE-

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:10.060
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.328
OF LEGISLATORS ARE GRAPPLING

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.963
WITH HOW TO ADDRESS THAT SORT

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.498
OF NOT ONLY THE REGULATORY

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.733
REFORM SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.468
BUT ALSO TO STRIKE WHEN THERE

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.536
IS GONNA BE THE SOURCE%

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.438
SITUATION WHERE THE ECONOMY

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:23.440
DIPS. THINGS CONTRACT AND

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.141
DEVELOPERS ARE NOT GOING TO

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.443
BUILD BECAUSE THE PROFITS ARE

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.878
NOT THERE FOR THEM AND SO

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:28.812
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.780
CAN CONTROL YOU CAN CONTROL IN

00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:31.314
THE SENSE THAT YOU COULD

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:33.650
PROVIDE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES WITH

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:35.752
STRONG CONDITIONS TO BILL THE

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:38.054
TYPE OF HOUSING THAT A LOT OF

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:39.489
WORKERS NEED TODAY. I MEAN

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:42.058
WE'RE SEEING THE PRICES GO UP A

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:45.328
WE'RE ALSO NOT SEEING THE WAGES

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.197
GO UP THE ACTUALLY THE DRESS

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.198
THAT I TRY TO ACTUALLY GO ON

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:51.134
AND BE- ELIGIBLE TO BUY A HOME

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.270
IN TODAY'S ECONOMY AND SO IF

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:56.139
YOU'RE ABLE TO. SUBSIDIZE IT

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.641
CONDITION IT ADDRESS THE

00:52:57.707 --> 00:53:00.577
WORKFORCE ISSUES I THINK YOU

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:02.245
CAN HAVE THAT COUNTER CYCLICAL

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.780
RESPONSE TO THAT. SO IF I HAVE

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:06.583
A AT MANAGER RESPONSE AYE AYE I

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:07.584
SUPPORTED THAT WAS CENTER BILLS

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.786
WELL WAS IT SB FIVE YEAH I

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:10.820
SUPPORTED THAT AND I'VE

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:13.123
SUPPORTED RDAS AND- I THINK

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.025
GOVERNOR BROWN ACTED NOT OUT OF

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:19.696
THAT LACK OF INTEREST IN.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:20.297
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT OUT OF

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:20.931
THE BUDGET CRISIS HE WAS FACING

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:25.035
BUT. AND I AND I AND I AND IN

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:25.669
OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR WE'VE DONE

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:26.570
A LOT TO TRY TO SUBSIDIZE

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.137
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I'VE

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:27.737
BEEN SUPPORTER OF THAT AND THE

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:28.371
SENATE HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF

00:53:28.438 --> 00:53:29.072
THAT. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.707
IS NOT GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.642
SMALL PART OF HOW GETTING OUR

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.311
WAY THROUGH THE SUPPLY PROBLEM

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:35.712
THAT REALLY IS I MEAN. I'D LOVE

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.213
SOME ECONOMISTS TALK ABOUT THE

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.015
BIG PICTURE OF HAVE OVER THREE

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:39.616
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS AND HOW

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.284
MANY. EVEN THE BILLIONS THAT

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:42.085
WE'RE SPENDING WITHIN

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.219
GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.854
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THREE

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:45.488
HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINK I'D BE

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.590
PRETTY SMALL BUT I'D LOOK FOR

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:47.891
THE EXPERTS TO GUIDE US ON

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:49.593
THAT. THAT'S THAT'S THE DILEMMA

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:51.027
THOUGH RIGHT I MEAN SO IT'S A

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:52.195
PEOPLE WE'RE ALL WE'RE DOING IS

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.830
DOING LITTLE THINGS NOT THAT

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:54.397
THERE AREN'T IMPORTANT DON'T

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:57.267
MISUNDERSTAND ME- BUT THEY ARE

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.468
SMALL IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEM

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.537
THAT WE'RE FACING- THERE WAS A

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.238
STORY TODAY- THESE TWO WAS

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.808
ONLINE. TODAY BY CAL MATTERS.

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.309
ABOUT A DIFFERENT FORM OF

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.778
CONSTRUCTION- MY THE MODULAR

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.113
UNITS IS THAT THE RIGHT FOR HOW

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.448
THEY REFER TO THEM FACTORY

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.850
BUILT WITH. AND I'M SURE

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:14.451
THERE'S SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:15.919
WORK FORCE THERE AND WHAT

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:16.953
THEY'RE BEING PAID. WHICH IS A

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.055
LEGITIMATE QUESTION- BUT IN

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.957
REGARD TO BUILDING IT FASTER

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:22.459
AND CHEAPER WE HAVE TO CHANGE

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:24.728
THE DYNAMIC I GET THAT OFF. I

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:25.629
KNOW WHY THE LUXURY HOMES ARE

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:28.264
STILL HAPPENING. BUT THAT'S

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.833
REALLY ALMOST A SIDE ISSUE TO

00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:31.434
WHAT WE HAD GOT WHAT CAN WE AND

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.870
GOVERNMENT DO. THE CHANGE THIS

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.971
EQUATION TO GET OUT OF THIS

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.206
COURTNEY AND LOT THAT NOT THAT

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.941
WE'RE FACING. NO REALLY AND WE

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.042
HAVE TO DO IT IN A BIG WAY IT'S

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.276
NOT A LITTLE WAY I MEAN THERE'S

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:42.045
A REASON. THE ASPIRATIONAL

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:42.846
GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR WHICH WE

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:44.347
ALL APPRECIATE AND ADMIRE.

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:46.449
LET'S BE CLEAR IT'S FALLING

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:48.051
FLAT BECAUSE BUT WHAT DO WE DO

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:50.120
THIS YEAR. TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.755
THAT IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY AND

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:53.990
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE BUDGET.

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.392
AUGMENTATIONS AND THE REST

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.227
WHICH ARE VALUABLE AND KNOCKS.

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.728
THAT'S NOT REALLY. CONFRONTING

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:00.764
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GUYS

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.565
TALKING ABOUT HERE WHETHER IT'S

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:03.333
ABOUT. THIS SKILLED WORKFORCE

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.367
THE WAGE TO THE AFFORDABILITY

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.503
SO REALLY HOW DO WE BREAK IT

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.271
DOWN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY I

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.472
THINK IT'S GETTING EVERYBODY

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:10.774
OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AT

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.375
SOME LEVEL. BUT WE HAVE TO JUST

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:13.910
BE WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.578
IT. IS THE BIG PROBLEM IS

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.847
SIMPLE EITHER BIG ACTIONS OR

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:22.952
SIGNIFICANT. ACTIONS OVER A

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:23.520
PERIOD OF TIME TO REALLY GET

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.120
OUT OF IT. THIS IS THE DILEMMA

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:30.260
WE. FIND I THINK I THINK THAT'S

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.728
ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND I AM. I'M

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:32.829
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE STEPS

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:33.797
ARE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE BUT

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:36.433
THE M. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:37.000
LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THIS OVER

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:43.506
THE INTERIM. AND. I THINK IT'S

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.775
GONNA TAKE RETHINKING HOW WE

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:48.445
HOW WE HOUSE PEOPLE AND PART OF

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:51.314
THAT IS UNDERSTANDING THAT.

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:52.882
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN IN MY

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:55.618
COMMUNITY- THE RENTS IN SALINAS

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:57.787
IN OUR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.289
FOR A THREE BEDROOM HOME THREE

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:02.058
BEDROOM TWO BATH HOME. AND WHEN

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.893
YOU'RE MEDIAN INCOME IS

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.329
SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY FIVE

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:09.099
THOUSAND DOLLARS- YOU HAVE A

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:09.733
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT EARNING MUCH

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.736
LESS. AND. AND THAT THREE

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.404
BEDROOM HOUSE WILL BE RENTED BY

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:15.972
THREE FAMILIES THAT EACH SHARE

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:17.507
A BEDROOM AND THEN- AND

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:18.608
EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH MEANS ARE

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:20.643
PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX CARS. THAT

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.911
DON'T FIT IN THE DRIVEWAY

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.279
THEY'RE STARTING TO CLOG THE

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:26.549
NEIGHBORHOOD AND- AND IT'S A

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:29.185
SIGNIFICANT. SOCIAL ISSUE

00:56:29.252 --> 00:56:29.886
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:30.987
COMING AND WHO'S GOING WHO

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.222
REALLY LIVES THERE AND IF

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:33.556
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE THE

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:34.157
NEIGHBORS THAT ARE DOING THAT

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.258
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE YOU

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:36.826
KNOW IT THAT. YOU CAN REALLY

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.828
TELL THEM IT'S INCREDIBLE

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:39.929
PRESSURE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:42.732
OF A COMMUNITY. AND SO THE

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:43.967
QUESTION THEN BECOMES DOES IT

00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:47.337
MAKE SENSE. TO ME BUILDING

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:47.904
TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.706
FOOT. FOUR BEDROOM HOUSES OR

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:50.840
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE BUILDING A

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.008
MUCH SMALLER UNITS AND BUILT

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.243
AND BE BUILDING I'M IN A WAY

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.778
THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.279
PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO SOMETHING

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:59.115
THAT SMALL. I BET THEY CAN

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:01.317
AFFORD TO BUY AND THEN CAN MOVE

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:04.687
UP ECONOMICALLY. BECAUSE. FROM

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:05.922
MY PERSPECTIVE. THAT THE

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:08.525
PRESSURES ON ALMOST THE IN THE

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.659
ENTIRE PART OF MY DISTRICT IS

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:13.396
IT IS REALLY EMBEDDED UP UP

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.532
AGAINST THE SILICON VALLEY SO

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.733
UP A LOT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.369
ARE IMPACTED BY. A COMMUTERS

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.070
THAT ARE DRIVING AT LEAST TWO

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:24.541
HOURS TO GET TO WORK. ON AND-

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:27.377
AND IF WE START. IN A SUBJECT

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.511
FOR ANOTHER HEARING IF WE START

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.947
ON. PUTTING UP A FEE ON VEHICLE

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.916
MILES TRAVELED THOSE ARE THE

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:35.952
PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA END UP

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:37.854
GETTING HURT OR THAT ARE THE

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:38.988
POOREST PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:43.526
TO WORK. A IN THE WHERE THERE.

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:44.928
AND BE IT AND THIS IMPACT BUT

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.629
LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME ASK

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:48.965
YOU IF THERE'S- IT. I OBVIOUSLY

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.900
WERE REPRESENT A RURAL-

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.136
COMMUNITY AND SO SOME OF THE

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:54.737
ISSUES THAT YOU SEE IN THE BIG

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:57.273
CITIES ARE ARE ARE. REFLECTED A

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.675
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN RURAL

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:01.578
CALIFORNIA- IN PARTICULAR IN

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:05.515
THE LAST MAN IS IN THE- AND THE

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:07.650
PATTERSON AND NEWMAN AREA

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:08.952
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET A LOT OF

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:12.322
THERE ACTUALLY IS A LOT OF

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:15.925
HOMEBUILDING GOING ON. BECAUSE.

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:16.693
OF COMMUTERS. PRICING OUT THE

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:17.660
LOWER. AND I'M WONDERING IF- IF

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:22.765
THE- IF THE PRESSURE FROM. THE

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:25.201
THERE'S THIS PRESSURE IN THE

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:28.037
REGION FOR GOOD JOBS MY SENSE

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.039
IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:30.673
IN THOSE JOBS ARE NOT FROM THE

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.910
REGION- PARTICULARLY GIVEN MY

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.078
CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.747
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND SO

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:39.515
ARE PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OUT

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.651
OF STATE OR THEY COMING FROM

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:43.987
THE FROM THE BIGGER CITIES THAT

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:44.387
ARE. WHERE THEY'RE

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.722
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE.

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:49.692
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THAT. AND

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:51.361
IT IS IT RESIDENTIAL OR

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:53.196
RESIDENTIAL THIS RESIDENTIAL

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:54.297
AND COMMERCIAL AS WELL BUT IT'S

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.900
RESIDENTS. IT'S LIKELY THAT THE

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.468
WORKERS THAT ARE BUILDING THOSE

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.336
HOMES ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.237
PRESIDENTS OF THOSE AREAS IS

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.506
MOST LIKELY THAT HAPPENS ON WE

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:06.075
HAD OF OUR PARTICULAR CASE THAT

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:06.643
WE TOOK ALL THE WAY TO THE

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.610
SUPREME COURT WHERE CHARTER

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:08.811

PREVAILING WAGE OR MUNICIPAL

WORK AND WITHIN THAT UP CASE WE

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.751
PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:15.652
SUPREME COURT WE ENDED UP

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:17.587
LOSING THIS CASE BUT- WE

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.821
PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.256
TALKED ABOUT WHY IT'S SO

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:21.557
IMPORTANT TO PAY. THE

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:23.326
PREVAILING WAGE TO THESE

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.727
WORKERS BECAUSE WORKERS ARE

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.496
TRANSIT THEIR TEN STORY THEY

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:27.830
BELIEVE THEY TRAVEL TO WHERE

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.666
THE WORK AS AS TO OUR MEMBERS

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:33.670
IS NOT- STRANGE THEM ALSO

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:34.637
BASICALLY TO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:35.905
TO HAVE GET TO THE JOB SITE AND

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.840
THE TRAVEL OF TWO HUNDRED MILES

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.209
A DAY. IN A TO GET TO AND FROM

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.779
THE JOB SITE OF SOME

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.447
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO WORK

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:47.951
FARTHER BUT THAT'S JUST IF THE

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:49.552
THROUGHTHE WORK IN TERMS OF

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:50.954
BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE A WIND

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:55.458
FARM OR SOLAR. ENERGY FOR

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:56.059
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:59:56.125 --> 01:00:01.264
DESERT. BUT IT IS

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.732
INFRASTRUCTURE JACQUE REID AND

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:03.333
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE HOMES-

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.067
Là THESE WORKERS. THE

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:04.968
CONTRACTOR WILL PICK UP THE

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.769
WORK. THE COLIN THEIR WORKERS

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:07.337
THEY'LL ALL COMMUTE TOGETHER

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.138
AND THE ALL. YOU KNOW BASICALLY

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.506
SPEND THE DAY WORKING. ARM AND

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.575
THEY WON'T HAVE. THE SORT OF

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:13.843
QUALITY OF LIFE NOT ONLY YOU'LL

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.644
TAKE A THE CYPRESS EITHER THE

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.713
QUALITY OF THE JOB. BUT THE

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.448
ACTUAL QUALITY OF LIFE RIGHT

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.816
THAT THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.985
JOB SITE PERHAPS BEEN ALL DAY

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.753
TRAVELING IN THE NEXT TO HAVE

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.421
TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. AND SO

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.824
IT'S A- IT'S A VERY MENTALLY

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.226
DANGEROUS INDUSTRY BUT ALSO

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.895
IT'S A VERY OF PHYSICAL SERVICE

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.998
STRENUOUS SORT OF A WORK THAT

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.600
HAPPENS AND- IT TAKES A LOT.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:38.468
OUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.469
IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.004
FOR A FOR HIS HER FAMILY TO

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.505
MATCH WOULD COME HOME AND SPEND

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.774
QUALITY TIME SO. THE LIKELIHOOD

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.042
OF A WORKER IN PATTERSON

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:49.512
STAYING WITHIN. THE FIFTY MILE

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:54.283
RADIUS IS PROBABLY VERY LOW. I

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.451
WOULD JUST ECHO. AND AN OFFER

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.652
MAYBE IT ALONE SLIGHTLY

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.187
DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.022
OBVIOUSLY HIGH DENSELY

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.758
POPULATED AREAS ARE- MAGNETS

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.927
AND DRAW- INDIVIDUALS WITH YOU

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.662
NO PROSPECTS OF HIGHER INCOME

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:09.766
OPPORTUNITIES- RULE AREAS TEND

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:13.469
TO- JUST NOT HAVE THE- THE

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.038
LABOR POOL. A LOCAL LABOR POOL

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:18.007
TO MEET EITHER- THE STATE'S WAS

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.376
AS SKILLED WORKFORCE- I

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.378
REQUIREMENTS. AND SO YOU KNOW

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.814
OTHERS WILL NEED TO COME IN TO

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.616
HELP. OFFSET THOSE NUMBERS AND

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.184
IN ORDER FOR THE JOB TO BE-

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:32.688
COMPLIANT- AND SO THOSE RULE

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.690
AREAS STILL HAVE. PUBLIC

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.059
INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC PROP

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.860
PROJECTS. WHETHER IT'S THE

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.763
LOCAL JAIL. OR THE LOCAL SCHOOL

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.498

SCHOOL. PRESUMABLY AT THAT

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.576
LOCATION THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.878
WORK ON THAT BECAUSE- JUST NOT

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.346
ENOUGH WORKERS IN THAT

01:01:57.413 --> 01:02:00.216
PARTICULAR AREA TO ME WHATEVER

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.251
THIS COMPLIANCE IS- AND SO.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.719
THOSE FROM HIGHER DENSITY

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:06.189
POPULATED AREAS WILL COME IN-

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.991
METERS COMPLIANCE NUMBERS- AND

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:11.127
AS- SAYS EARLY TO YOU KNOW

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.729
THAT. USUALLY THE HOTELS AND

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.898
TOURISM- LOOK AT INDUSTRY BUT

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.733
IT'S FROM THAT- FROM STAYING

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.939
AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY BUT IT.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:23.539
IT IS IT'S A TAXING SITUATION

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:28.845

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.379
ABOUT THE PRINTER PROGRAMS I

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:30.980

IF THE JOBS AREN'T THERE

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:36.552
NECESSARILY ON A CONTINUOUS

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.187

THE SAME INTEREST IN IN THE JOB.

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.191
IN IN GETTING THE TRAINING IF

HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MADE A

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.967
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:51.567
CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT'S BEEN A

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:57.507
GREAT. IT REALLY HAS BEEN A-

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.188
DON'T KEEP THE WORK FORCE THERE

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:13.022
THEY'LL MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.558
THAT'S RIGHT- IT'S AN

IT'S MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION-

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:04.620
VERY DELIBERATELY. THAT'S GREAT

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.388

OF OPPORTUNITY SO THESE

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.404
APPRENTICES COULD MOVE FROM ONE

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.305
PROJECT TO ANOTHER STAY WITHIN

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.174

CEREMONIES IT THEY DO FOR

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.538

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:59.742
REALLY A UNIQUE- OPPORTUNITY TO

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.010

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.326
GUARDIAN NOT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:18.861

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:19.495
PIECES WE NEED TO PUT TOGETHER

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:22.698
TO GET OUT THERE BECAUSE- THAT

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.401
THE PUBLIC MONEY INVOLVED IT

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.503

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.521
CREATIVE ABOUT HOW AND- IF YOU

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.789

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.290
OPEN TO LOOKING AT ANYTHING

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.226

IMPORTANT. AND THE PROGRAM FOR

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.615
BETTER GREW OUT OF A UNIQUE

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.550
CIRCUMSTANCE. OUR INDUSTRY WAS

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.452
INVITED TO A CAREER DAY AT A

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.922
HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEY WERE

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:00.555
GONNA GET SOME TALKS ABOUT THE

GO LISTEN TO. AT LOAN BEHOLD

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.430
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:11.066
VERY SPARSELY ATTENDED. AND

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.668
THOUGH HE ASKED THE STUDENTS

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:17.172
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND-

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:17.639
THE PERCEPTION IS YAK

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:19.741
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE JOB. IT'S

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.643
AN IT'S RELIABLE IT'S MANUAL

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:22.611
BURKE AND IT'S NOT CAREER BASED

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.413
AND SO HE SAID YES WE REALLY

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.180
NEED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE SO

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.182
HE DEVELOPED THE CURRICULUM IN

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.016
TWO THOUSAND TWO WITH NORTH

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.719
ORANGE COUNTY ROP REGIONAL

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.621
OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAMS- AND

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:35.090
THAT. I A WHICH IS THE INDUSTRY

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.658
SAYS GEN. I'M THE EVEN

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.527
SPONSORED A NEW CONSTRUCTION AB

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.628
THEY PAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:40.529
THE CREEK LAMB SO THAT THAT

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:42.264
SPREAD VERY QUICKLY IN ANAHEIM

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.066
TO EIGHT SCHOOLS. AND THEN- BUT

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.935
IT WAS ADOPTED BY MY FOUNDATION

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:47.669
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO MAKE

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:56.044
IT A STATEWIDE. INITIATIVE AND

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:56.545
WERE NOW THIRTY TWO HIGH

01:16:56.611 --> 01:17:07.990

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.591
FORCED BY EDUCATING AND

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.158
INSPIRING THESE STUDENTS TO

JOIN OUR INDUSTRY. SO HOW ARE

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.896
WE DOING THIS AND WHY HAS IT

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.965
BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL- I THINK THE

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.867
PROGRAM IS WIDELY POPULAR AMONG

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.435
OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.803
BECAUSE THE CURRICULUM MEETS

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.704
THE NEEDS OF OUR COLLEGE AND

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.906
CAREER BOUND STUDENTS. ANSWER

THAT G. ELECTIVE AND WHEN YOU

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:28.877
HAVE A COLLEGE BOUND STUDENT

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.644
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AN

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:30.979
ELECTIVE COURSEUNLESS IT'S

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.748
GOING TO BENEFIT THEIR ABILITY

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:58.938
GO THE EXTRA MILE TO BE ABLE TO

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:01.073
GRADUATE WITH AN EIGHTY AT THE

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.141
SAME TIME THAT THE GRADUATING

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:03.276
WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:06.078
I- I'M I GUESS I STRUGGLE

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:07.079
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY ISN'T

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:11.184
EVERYBODY DOING THIS RIGHT- AND

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.686
LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:15.822
BRING IN NONTRADITIONAL KIDS

01:58:15.888 --> 01:58:17.623
GET A LOT OF KIDS DON'T LEARN

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:18.858
BY SITTING AT A DESK AND BEING

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:21.561
QUIET YEAH AND- FRANKLY MANY OF

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:22.929
THEM GET MOVED OFF TO SOME

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:24.697
OTHER PLACE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:26.466
SIT QUIETLY AND YET IF YOU PUT

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:27.433
A MINUTE ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.100
THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIR

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:30.236
HANDS. OR THEY'RE WORKING AS A

01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:31.270
TEAM THEN THEY CAN TALK ABOUT

01:58:31.337 --> 01:58:33.372
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND IT'S NOT

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:34.674
IT'S A DIFFERENT MODALITIES

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:37.009
HAVE SO- I'M I'M REALLY

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:38.778
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT WAYS

01:58:38.845 --> 01:58:42.081
THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THAT

01:58:42.148 --> 01:58:46.686
KIND OF CREATIVITY AND. TRY TO

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:47.286
BUILD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS

01:58:47.353 --> 01:58:48.788
TO BE ABLE TO TRY EVERYTHING.

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:49.589
SO THAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:50.590
WHAT THE LIKE ABSOLUTE AND WE

01:58:50.656 --> 01:58:52.825
CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO START

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:54.360
THINKING ABOUT THAT A LOT

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:55.895
EARLIER THAN WE'RE DOING. WE'RE

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:58.865
DOING NOW. YES IN THE- SO WHY

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.534
AM I I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.336
CLUE. WELL I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:06.072
IS- ARE THERE OBSTACLES TO THE

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:08.875
DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM. THAT

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.743
WOULD BE THAT THAT WE COULD BE

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.145
HELPFUL FOR NUMBER ONE IS OUR

01:59:13.212 --> 01:59:13.813
OBSTACLES AND NUMBER TWO IS ONE

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:17.350
OF THOSE OBSTACLES MONEY- AND

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:20.686
ARE THERE. CHANGES TO THE END

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:21.721
COULD THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:24.156
IN ORDER TO. TO TRY TO

01:59:24.223 --> 01:59:25.925
INCENTIVIZE MORE MORE STUDENTS

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:29.629
GOING INTO- THE TRADE I A I

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:32.832
KNOW THAT FOR A WHILE. THERE

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:33.499
THERE WAS TRACKING GOING ON IN

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:34.867
THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE

01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:38.938
REASONS THAT THAT. THAT WE

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.873
CHANGE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.508
SO IT BECAME MUCH MORE

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.844
DIFFICULT TO TRACK BUT IT JUST

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:45.444
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WENT WE

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:47.947
SWUNG SO FAR AWAY FROM- FROM

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:50.483
KERR AGING SOME OF SOME F THE-

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:52.151
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:54.053
THAT THAT STUDENTS HAVE LOST

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:54.921
THE ABILITY TO THINK THAT

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:57.056
THAT'S A GOOD PATHWAY. SO I'M

01:59:57.123 --> 01:59:59.191
I'M I'M I GUESS I'M LOOKING AT

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:00.927
IS THERE IS THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.862
CHALLENGES TO THE DUAL

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:03.462
ENROLLMENT AND ARE THE THINGS

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:07.333
WE NEED TO DO. THERE ARE A

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.902
COUPLE OF CHALLENGES ONE IS IT

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:12.471
HAS TO DO WITH THE AND- AND I'M

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:14.240
SPEAKING FROM LIMITED KNOWLEDGE

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:15.641
GIVEN I'M ONLY BEING HUNDRED

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:18.210
DAYS AND CALIFORNIA IN MY

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:18.844
POSITION SO. IT BEAR WITH ME ON

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:21.981
THAT. I FOR ONE CHALLENGES OF

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:24.183
COURSE IS A CLASS SCHEDULE IN

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:24.817
THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT REALLY HAS

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:27.253
TO DO WITH. BECAUSE IT MAY

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.422
REQUIRE THEIR DISC TO THAN TO

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:31.090
GO ELSEWHERE TO GET THOSE TO A

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:33.593
LENORMAND COURSE SO THAT'S WHEN

02:00:33.659 --> 02:00:34.660
SHELVE FUNDING YES IS A

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:37.530
PROBLEM. BUT I THINK. A LOT OF

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.065
THE- DUAL ENROLLMENT THAT IS

02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:41.634
HAPPENING AND CALIFORNIA'S NON

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:44.103
UNIQUE IN THIS. IT IS HAPPENING

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:47.073
BETWEEN. A RELATIONSHIP WHICH

02:00:47.139 --> 02:00:49.041
IS GOOD THAT IS BUILT BETWEEN

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.843
THE INSTRUCTOR AT THE HIGH-

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.044
THAT AND TEACHER AT THE HIGH

02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:53.412
SCHOOL IN THE INSTRUCTED THE

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:55.781
COMMUNICATE LIKE IT DOESN'T GET

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:57.516
BECOME SYSTEMATIC AND THAT'S

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.852
WHAT I'VE- IS SO I MEAN I WOULD

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:01.554
RIDE THE STATE I CAME FROM WAS

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:04.824
THE IOWA. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:07.426
THAT DAD DOES ACTUALLY IS. IT

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:10.663
WAS PUT INTO THE I WILL CALL TO

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:12.031
HOW THEY WOULD FIND

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:14.700
SYSTEMATICALLY DUAL ENROLLMENT

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.802
SO I AT THAT WOULD DOES IT DID

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:19.138
TO A DIVISION THAT THE THAT

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.239
WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:21.774
SUGGESTION BUT I THINK PART OF

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:25.478
IT IS SIMPLY. SYSTEM MY SISTER

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.346
DIES IN THAT WE GET WE AT CITY

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:30.182
HALL AT COLLEGE GOING COURSES

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:31.617
THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY BULLARD

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:32.585
ALMOND BUT IT CAN INCLUDE

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:36.055
ARTICULATE AND IT DOES INCLUDE

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:37.657
SOME OF THE A. P. AND IB

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:39.258
COURSES AT THAT ARE THERE. AND

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:41.260
YOUR OUT I TRADITION STUDENTS

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:45.231
ARE I. PLAYED TO LOOK AT IS

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:47.199
REALLY THE FUNDING MY DEBT FROM

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:55.741
ME AND I MIGHT BE. THIN

02:01:55.808 --> 02:02:02.314
FLEXIBLE BEFORE FOR TOM FOR.

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.617
46% IS THERE ON THAT'S WHAT

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:05.818
I'VE BEEN TOLD I MAKE IT. YEAH

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:10.022
ABSOLUTELY. I'M I JUST ON THE

02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:11.290
DUAL ENROLLMENT ISSUE AYE AYE

02:02:11.357 --> 02:02:13.192
AND EVERY STATE'S DIFFERENT BUT

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.027
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:16.495
THEIR WISDOM IN THE GOVERNOR

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:17.830
NOW CREATED- TUITION FREE

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.632
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE'RE

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:20.866
FINDING STUDENTS AT THE

02:02:20.933 --> 02:02:22.601
COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL IN THE

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:23.969
COURSE WORK THAT THEY TAKE IT

02:02:24.036 --> 02:02:25.738
NO COST AND WE CERTAINLY ARE

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:26.572
DOING THAT IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:29.842
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE AT AGAIN I

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:30.776
HEAR ISSUES ABOUT FUNDING- WHO

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:33.479
FINDS THE TEXTBOOK- WHERE IT'S

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:35.281
LOCATED IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:37.416
THAT'S A BIG BARRIER THAT'S

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:39.151
BEEN REMOVED NOW AND NOW WE

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:40.453
NEED TO GET SYSTEMS TOGETHER

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:42.021
SILENCE AND ACTUALLY JUST THINK

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:43.355
ABOUT THE KIDS WHAT'S- FOR THE

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:45.224
KIDS. WHERE IT HAPPENS YOUR

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:48.127
PLACE MY PLACE AND I JUST WANT

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:49.395
TO SAY TO THE CHAIR THAT ANY

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:51.731
KIND OF WORK IN THIS YEAR I'D

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.531
LOVE TO TRY TO PARTNER AND BE

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:55.768
SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:57.737
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS IDEA

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:00.806
OF THIS THERE ONE WAY THERE'S

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:04.643
ONE TRACK FOR A STUDENT AND- I

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.245
THINK THAT THAT THERE THERE ARE

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:09.315
STUDENTS THAT ARE ENTERING HIGH

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:11.350
SCHOOL THAT COULD BEGIN COLLEGE

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:13.052
AND A BA DO ON ALL THAT WE HAVE

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.720
TO GO. AT THEM AS THEY ARE AND

02:03:14.787 --> 02:03:15.888
FIND THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.324
BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY PROSPER

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:20.359
AND I THINK THAT THE SILOS CAN

02:03:20.426 --> 02:03:22.328
GET IN THE WAY BUT SOMETIMES

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:23.129
THAT MEANS WE NEED SOME SMART

02:03:23.195 --> 02:03:29.268
LEGISLATORS. WELL I WITH SOME

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:29.835
GREAT PARTNERS TO FIND A WAY

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:33.672
THROUGH. IT SAID THAT THE OUR

02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:36.208
FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. MAY I

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:40.045
ADD ONE MORE THING TITLE. WHEN

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:40.946
DOLAN MOMENT HAPPENS TYPICALLY

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:42.381
IT'S AROUND THE WHAT I WOULD

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:43.115
CALL THE ACADEMIC COURSES

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:44.083
BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE LOOKING TO

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:44.650
THE A TO G. TRYING TO MEET

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:45.851
THOSE REQUIREMENTS I THINK

02:03:45.918 --> 02:03:46.786
THERE HAS TO BE SORT OF MORE

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:49.155
EMPHASIS OF INVOLVING C. T. IN

02:03:49.221 --> 02:03:50.456
THIS PROCESS OF DUAL ENROLLMENT

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:54.059
AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT AND

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.595
I DO AGREE AND I AGREE WITH. AS

02:03:56.662 --> 02:03:57.730
SENATOR GLAZIER IT'S- THE IT'S

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:59.198
THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:01.233
IS THAT. THERE USED TO BE A

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:03.269
LIMIT ON HOW MANY COURSES A

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:06.038
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. COULD TAKE

02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:08.541
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN.

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:09.842
SATISFACTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:11.177
REQUIREMENTS AND THE REASON WHY

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:13.512
SAYS THEY WANTED KIDS TO STAY

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:15.014
IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT TO

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.148
BE TAKING UP THE STUFF THAT'S

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.216
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.350
LEAST THAT'S HOW IT WAS

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.286
REPORTED TO ME. BUT NOW AND I

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:22.388
THINK WELL ACTUALLY I CAN'T SAY

02:04:22.454 --> 02:04:24.990
FOR SURE BUT BUT NOW I THINK

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:26.225
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S THAT THAT WE

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:29.628
HAVE WE HAVE- MADE IT A LOT

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:31.564
EASIER TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.365
COLLEGE. FIRST STUDENTS THAT

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:35.901
WERE CLEAN- FINANCIALLY. AND

02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:38.971
THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DO

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:42.007
BOTH. AT THE SAME TIME COULD BE.

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:43.542
VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF I

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:44.944
MAY IN RESPONSE THE D. A. YES.

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:45.978
BUT THINK ABOUT IT THAT IF YOU

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:47.213
HAVE A STUDENT THAT'S WHAT IT'S

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:49.048
CAPABLE AND WILLING TO GO TAKE

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.316
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:54.153
COURSES- EARLY- THAT THAT WHAT

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.855
THEY GET OUT OF IT IS. THOUGHT

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:57.089
ABOUT A TO G. ANYMORE BECAUSE

02:04:57.156 --> 02:04:57.957
THEY AT THE END OF THEIR FOUR

02:04:58.023 --> 02:05:00.059
YEARS. THERE AND ABILITY TO

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:01.260
TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR BECAUSE

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:03.095
THEY'VE COMPLETED. THE SIXTY

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.998
UNITS OF GENERAL EDUCATION AT

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:08.100
THE OLLEGE LEVEL. SO THE WHOLE

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:09.768
A THROUGH G. ISSUE CAN GONNA

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.537
