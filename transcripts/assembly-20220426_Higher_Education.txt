THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. EIGHTY SEVEN OH FIVE HAS USHERED IN A NEW ERA OF ACCESS AND COMPLETION OF ENTRY LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH COURSES AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS NOW SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES. IN FALL TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED IN MATH DIDN'T COMPLETE THE TRANSFER LEVEL REQUIREMENT WITHIN THE ONE YEAR TIME FRAME AND THAT NUMBER WAS STILL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS NOT COMPLETING A TWO YEAR TIME FRAME. THESE THROUGHPUT RATES WERE CONSISTENTLY LESS THAN 30% IN FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER AB SEVEN OH FIVE NEARLY SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND OUT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED TRANSFER LEVEL MATH WITHIN ONE YEAR WHICH GIVES A THROUGHPUT RATE OF 50% I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE EXTREMELY PROMISING IMPROVEMENTS AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TIRELESS WORK OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY. COUNSELORS ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPPORT STAFF ACROSS THE STATE. THIS MAJOR CHANGE WAS NOT EASY. AND I HAVE ENGAGED N GOOD FAITH DISCUSSIONS WITH FACULTY AND CAMPUS LEADERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE SPIRIT OF SEVEN OH FIVE WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED. AS WELL AS SOME OF WHAT SOME OF THE OBSTACLES AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WERE. A. B. SEVEN OH FIVE REPRESENTS MY ATTEMPT TO INCORPORATE FEEDBACK FROM A DIVERSE SET OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FACULTY MEMBERS STUDENTS. MATHIS CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS AND MOST CRUCIALLY CHANCELLOR OAKLEY AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHICH ALSO DESERVE RECOGNITION FOR THEIR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL SEVERAL IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS TO THE ORIGINAL AB SEVEN OH FIVE STATUTE. FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THE UNIVERSE OF THOSE WHO THE TRANSFER LEVEL REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO. SO AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE EXPLICITLY EXEMPTS PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE MATH OR ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS AS EIGHTY SEVEN OH FIVE WAS NEVER INTENDED TO CREATE NEW REQUIREMENTS WERE NINE EXISTED. IT EXAM STUDENTS AND ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS AND STUDENTS AND TECHNICAL CERTIFICATE OR DEGREE PROGRAMS WHERE THERE IS FIRST THAT WERE THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOT MET BY INAPPROPRIATE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL FOR OUR C. T. E. PASSED- PATHWAYS. THESE CHANGES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT DESPITE WHAT THE OPPONENTS HAVE CLAIMED THE COLLEGES STILL OFF- ARE ALLOWED TO OFFER AND GUIDE STUDENTS INTO PRE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE WORK WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A ROLE FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES BUT THEY NEED TO BE RELEVANT TO A STUDENT'S GOAL OR CAREER PATH IN FACT OUR EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO GOOD FAITH CRITIQUES IS WIDE NINETY THREE FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STAFF SIGNED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IMPLEMENTATION WAS ON EVEN ACROSS THE STATE MEANING ACT ACCESS TO TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES AND SUPPORTS DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE. CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENTS WHO WERE MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE CONFIRMED. AS THEY'VE SHARED STORIES OF FACULTY AND COUNSELORS STRONGLY RECOMMENDING REMEDIAL AND BELOW TRANSFER LEVEL COURSEWORK. EVEN WORTH THEY FEEL IT'S NOT NECESSARY. IN FACT ONE COLLEGE INCENTIVIZE STUDENTS TO TAKE REMEDIAL COURSEWORK BY PROVIDING PRIORITY REGISTRATION TO THOSE WHO TAKE A PLACEMENT TEST THAT CONSISTENTLY RECOMMEND STUDENTS REPEAT. ALREADY COMPLETED COURSES. ANOTHER STUDENT SHARED HOW SHE CHOSE TO ADD A TEN NOT THE CLOSEST COLLEGE OR THE SECOND CLOSEST COLLEGE THAT WAS A TO HER BUT INSTALL INSTEAD ENROLLED IN THE THIRD CLOSEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH WAS. AN HOUR AWAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE SHE FELT CONFIDENT. SHE WOULD BE SUPPORTED IN TRANSFER LEVEL WORK WITHOUT BEING PRESSURED INTO ACCESS WORK THAT WOULD COST HER TIME AND MEMBERS MONEY. WE HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE POWER AND INFLUENCE EDUCATORS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE ON STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO IMPLICIT BIASES. AND STEREO TYPE THREAT WE OWE IT TO OUR STUDENTS TO HELP THEM CHOOSE THE BEST CHOICE FOR THEIR INTENT INTENDED GOAL. AND NOT INSIST ON PRESENTING ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS AS EQUALLY LIKELY TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. TODAY WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS DOCTOR ARE YOU SHALLOW VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND SHE DIEGO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATE WITH STUDENTS MAKING A CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR RICE HELLO AND I SERVE AS VICE CHANCELLOR OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ON BEHALF OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I AM PLEASED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN FOR HER SUPPORT OF OUR COLLEGES FACULTY AND STUDENTS. THE MORE THAN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION STUDENTS ARE BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE NUMEROUS GOALS BUT NO MATTER STUDENTS GOALS PLACING STUDENTS IN THE RIGHT COURSES WHEN THEY ENROLL IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND THEIR FUTURE. PRIOR TO AB SEVEN OH FIVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE PLACED IN REMEDIAL COURSES FROM WHERE FROM WHICH FEW SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH COURSES. ATTRITION WAS HIGH PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO LATINO STUDENTS THE PRIOR USE OF STANDARDIZED TESTS FORCING STUDENTS INTO LENGTHY REMEDIAL COURSE SEQUENCES SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED STUDENTS ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND FAR TOO OFTEN COMPLETELY HALTED STUDENT COMPLETION. AB SEVENTY FIVE REFORM THOSE PRACTICES AND IS PROVING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL REFORMS OF OUR TIME. DISMANTLING STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT PREVIOUSLY PREVENTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM EVER REACHING THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS. THE TRADITIONAL PLACEMENT SYSTEM AB SEVEN OH FIVE AND NOW AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE SEEK TO REPLACE WAS A SYSTEM IN WHICH STUDENTS HAD NO CHOICE. AND THE CHOICE IS MADE FOR THEM WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE SUCCESS OF THOSE STUDENTS AND TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THESE LAWS ARE LIBERATING STUDENT CHOICE AND EXPANDING STUDENTS OPPORTUNITIES. A. B. SEVEN OH FIVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS ACCESS TRAINS LEVEL. AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THOSE COURSES NO MATTER THEIR PRIOR HIGH SCHOOL PERFORMANCE AND ACROSS ALL STUDENT SUBGROUPS. DESPITE THAT SENT US SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN STATED IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SEVEN OH FIVE REMAINS AN EVEN AN EQUITY GAPS PROCESS FAR TOO MANY COLLEGES ARE STILL OFFERING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF REMEDIAL COURSES OR NOT ENOUGH TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES WHICH INFLUENCES STUDENTS OPTIONS AND THEIR CHOICES. THEREFORE WE WELCOME AND SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN TO CLARIFY AND STRENGTHEN A. B. SEVEN OH FIVE S. THAT WILL HELP EVEN MORE STUDENTS TO ACCESS THESE ESSENTIAL TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES. AS AN OPEN ACCESS SYSTEM SUPPORTING 1100% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING ALL STUDENTS AND ENSURING THEIR SUCCESS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED WE STRONGLY BELIEVE AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE WILL HELP US TO FULFILL THAT MISSION. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUDY AGO. AND IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE I STARTED AT MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE I'VE GRADUATED SUMMA **** LAUDE FROM UC SANTA BARBARA. RECEIVE A HARVARD FELLOWSHIP. BECOME A PP I SEE IN TURN AND IN DOWN A CAL STATE MASSIVE STUDENT AND PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR SOON TO MAKE A CHANGE. NO SMACK WHICH IS A BLACK IN LATIN ACCIDENT LED. ORGANIZATION THIS IS ALL BECAUSE I'D FACULTY LIKE RAINY WILSON BELIEVE HIM CAPACITY MY CAPABILITY FOR ANY LEAGUE INSTITUTION EVER DID. AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD EVER GONE SECOND MEDIATION ARE LIKE MANY OF MY PEERS TO DEAL FACULTY WHO DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. SADLY THAT IS THE CASE FOR MANY STUDENTS AND OUR CALIFORNIA CALLED SYSTEM BUT NOT BEEN SO LUCKY. AND THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE AS A NECESSARY UPDATE TO AB SEVEN OH FIVE. ACCORDING PEOPLE I SEE EIGHTY SEVEN OH FIVE MORE THAN DOUBLED NUMBER STUDENTS PASSING TRANSFER OVER ENGLISH AND MATH. IT IS VERY FIRST TERM OF IMPLEMENTATION. UNFORTUNATELY THIS RISING TIDE HAS NOT LIFTED ALL BOATS EQUITABLY. AND IMPLEMENTATION HAS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE REPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOLUTION PROJECT FOUND AT LEAST HALF OF COLLEGES CONTINUE TO HAVE POLICING PRACTICES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED AND SET BACK BLACK AND LATINX STUDENTS. THIS IS NOT BELIEVING WHAT STUDENTS ARE CAPABLE OF. AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE. YOUR CLASSES LOWER COMPLETION RATES FOR EVERY GROUP RESEARCH SO FAR. AND YET SOME OPPONENTS CLAIM THAT THESE CLASSES ARE IMPORTANT CHOICES THAT STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE. BASED ON MY DIRECT WORK WITH SMACK I CAN HARDLY SAY THAT STUDENTS ONLY ONE CHOICES THAT ARE PROVEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET TO THEIR TRANSFER NAFTA MICHAEL'S ON TIME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THERE TYRA CONTI HAVING TO FIGHT TO GET THAT DONE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OPEN ACCESS TO SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA GOT COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. LIES ENTRANCE TUNES LIES ABOUT BELIEVING WHAT THE PEOPLE OF INVEST IN EXPANDING THAT CAPACITY AND THE CAPABILITY. WITH AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE WE CAN HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION HAS AN EVEN GREATER CHANCE TO REALIZE THEIR DREAMS THAN I DID A DECADE AGO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF THE TWO WOULD COME UP AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THEM. AT THE TABLE. AGAIN TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION MY NAME IS JENNY MAY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I TOO WAS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENT. THE S. TRIPLE C. REPRESENTS A LOCAL ACADEMIC SENATES OF A HUNDRED SIXTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES REGARDING AREAS OF CURRICULUM DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS AND STUDENT SUCCESS WE ARE COMMITTED TO CLOSING LONG STANDING OPPORTUNITY AND ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT CONTINUE TO PROCESS FOR TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WE APPRECIATE THE INTEREST IN SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE THAT MEET THE DIVERSE LEARNING AND SUPPORT NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE. OLD PLACEMENT PRACTICES WERE- EVEN UNFAIR AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED STUDENTS OF COLOR WE FULLY SUPPORT ACCESS TO TRANSFER LEVEL COURSEWORK AND THE GAINS ARE COMMENDABLE THAT SAID ACCESS TO ALL LEVELS OF COURSE WORK IS ESSENTIAL AS OPPOSED TO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. AS DIRECTED BY THE DELEGATES THE A. S. TRIPLE C. IS OPPOSING AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE AS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT ALL STUDENTS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE PLACED AN ENROLLED IN TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATHEMATICS EVEN WHEN THOSE COURSES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY THE DELEGATES ARE REQUESTING TO MAINTAIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MISSION AND TO NOT DENY STUDENTS ACCESS TO A PRE TRANSFER CORE THAT MEETS THE STUDENT'S EDUCATION NEEDS OR GOALS SUCH AS THOSE IN CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS OR FOR SKILL BUILDING. NEXT SINCE THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE COLLEGES TO ENROLL STUDENTS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL ENROLLMENT DATA IS INCLUDED ON THE TRANSFER LEVEL GATEWAY COMPLETION DASHBOARD WE THINK WESLEY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ONCE OFFICE FOR OTHERS HOPE TO CONTINUE TOGETHER IN SEARCH OF A STUDENT CENTERED SOLUTION THAT WILL CLOSE GROWING EQUITY GAPS THANK YOU YOU. THANK YOU. GERMANY NINE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DESIREE MONTENEGRO I'M AN FAA SEE SEE SEE BOARD MEMBER AND FACULTY AT CERRITOS COLLEGE AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE AND IT BY A LITTLE BIT OF A COLLEGE TODAY I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE AS A WOMAN OF COLOR I HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF REMEDIATION IN ENGLISH AND IN MATH REMEDIATION NOT ONLY SET ME BACK AT LEAST TWO YEARS IT REDIRECTED ME- FROM AWAY FROM A STEM CAREER UNFORTUNATELY MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR WOMEN AND NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY REMEDIATION AS A RESULT STUDENTS ARE DISCOURAGED OR CYCLED OUT OF PURSUING HOMOGENEOUS CAREER FIELDS LIKE THOSE IN STEM. OR THEY JUST DROP OUT AND LUCKILY I PERSISTED AND I FOUND A CAREER THAT WAS EQUALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT. BUT NOT ALL ARE SO LUCKY NEEDED CHANGE THAT HELP THE MANY STUDENTS WHO HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES JUST LIKE ME HOWEVER AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE IS FLAWED IT'S A FLAWED BILL THAT WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS PASSED AS IS THIS LAW WOULD CREATE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO OUR STUDENTS THAT OVERLOOKS THEIR UNIQUE ACADEMIC AND CAREER OBJECTIVES IN DOING SO YOU MAY BE DOING THE VERY THING THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PREVENT WITH THIS LEGISLATION. FACC REQUESTED AMENDMENTS FOCUSED ON SUPPORT AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SUCH AS SMALLER CLASSES A TEN TO ONE RATIO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR PART TIME FACULTY EMBEDDED FACULTY TUTORS IN THE CLASSROOM AND UPDATED CLASSROOMS TO SUPPORT ACTIVE LEARNING UNFORTUNATELY THESE AMENDMENTS WERE REJECTED WITHOUT THESE CHANGES WE COULD BE SETTING OUR FACULTY UP FOR FAILURE ESPECIALLY THOSE ADJUNCT FACULTY LIKE MYSELF. THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY OUR COLLEGES TO TEACH A BROAD RANGE OF STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL BUT I NEED THE TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT MY STUDENTS. CAN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FACILITATE FOR MYSELF IF AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE IS PASSED AS IS THE RESULT WOULD BE ANTITHETICAL TO THE HEART OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND I WOULD. ACTUALLY CREATE MORE BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS TO PREPARE FOR TRANSFER AND TO PURSUE CAREERS EARN FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES. OPTIONS DEVELOP AGENCY AN AGENCY IS WHAT PROPELLED MY RESILIENCE AND MY ULTIMATE SUCCESS AS AN ADJUNCT FACULTY TODAY. I AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL CHAMPION OUR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE OUTCOME. BUT YOU HAVE THE- TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO DATE TO THIS LOSS SO THAT YOU CAN DO THE SAME. I IMPLORE YOU TO CONSIDER THE FACTS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO WERE PLACED DIRECTLY INTO TRANSFER LEVER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH CLASSES WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND EVEN MORE DROPPED OUT. AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE DOES NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS AND WOULD LIKELY ELIMINATE SAFETY NETS OFFERING A WIDE RANGE OF COURSES TO SERVE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF STUDENTS IS NOT A BAD THING NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE TRANSFER STUDENTS AND AS ADJUNCT FACULTY MEMBER I AM ALWAYS ASKS TO DO MORE WITH LESS. WRAP UP YOUR TIME IS UP PLEASE. I WOULD ASK ME TO DO EVEN MORE WITH EVEN. LESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. I KNOW KNOW THERE ARE ANY- TWEETERS. WHEN IT COME UP TO THE TABLE.

COMPLICATED THIS FINISHED THEIR SEARCH PROGRAMS ARE CHIU- IN ANY OUR PIECES OF LEGISLATION COMING OF THIS BODY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU CONTINUED TO WORK ON THE BILL. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE  THINK THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I AM GOING TO REVIEW ROOM RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR. I'M IN HOPES THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. THANKS VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'D I'D- WE ALSO WANTED TO BE A VERY EXPLICIT IN IN THE- PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXEMPTED SO AT AND IT WAS NEVER AS I READ EARLIER WAS NEVER RECALL- MEANT TO CREATE ADDITIONAL REQUIRE. HUNTING PROGRAMS IN MULTI DUCATION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN DUAL ENROLLMENT AS STUDENTS IN TECHNICAL SIR TO A CERTIFICATE OR DEGREE PROGRAMS SO ANY PROGRAM WHERE IT IS THAT LEVEL OF MATH IS NOT REQUIRED IS ACCEPTED BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE WE DO WANT YOUR SUPPORT. IS THAT BECAUSE- THE EX. REMEDIAL WHICH CAN TO REALLY ELONGATES THE AMOUNT OF TIME- ONE SPENDS IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL BEFORE STEP SEVEN OH FIVE PASSED THE AVERAGE STUDENT SPENT SIX YEARS IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A MOVING ON TO FOUR YEAR PROGRAM ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS THAT DON'T HAVE THE MEANS THAT IS THAT TIME THEY CANNOT AFFORD TEN INCOME COLLEGE SO WE'RE JUST THAT THE NOT. THE TO P. SYRUP TO BIG THAT THAT SEVEN OH FIVE SIX BUT WE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IN STATE SO THESE ARE JUST A CLEAR- WORKING WITH THE FACT WITH FACT IN THE DIFFERENT- FACULTY GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT IT RIGHT AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING. AFTER YOU COVERED. DR JOY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROLE IN I WHAT DOES TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THIS ONE- AS A FORMER UNIVERSITY AND THEN ALSO COMMITTED COLLEGE OF FACULTY MEMBER- I AM I GUESS IN THIS CASE- A TWEENER. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU APPOINT THE SO THAT- COLLEGES STUDENTS ARE SHOULD BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO OF FACED- ACTUALCLASSES- AND THE BASED UPON THEIR ABILITY TO PASS OFF A- AND- A MOVEON IN A SHORT TIME AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT THE- THE- OPPOSING- THE ORGANIZATIONS- I DO SEE THE- MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES SET THEMSELVES THE SENATE THE OR SO OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AND THEN ON I THE NAY- COTTAGE PROFESSOR WAS ATTENDING ME- DEPLORING. OF ON. OF ENTER FRESH. AND THAT THEY ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME AND THE RESOURCES- TO REMEDY THOSE OF STUDENTS. SO I THINK THAT THIS A REMEDIAL CLASSES FOR OR REGION ON THE DESIGNED TO HELP THEM TO SUCCEED. BUT THE OBVIOUS TO HAS BECOME THE AREA IT TAKES TOO LONG TIME AND THE SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET OUT OF IT YEAH VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS. THAT START TO LEVELS BELOW REMEDIAL DROP OUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AT THE SAME TIME. AS YOU HEARD AWHILE AGO FROM THE OPPOSITION- STATEMENTS- THAT THE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS OF FAITH IN THE ART OF A REGULAR CLASS THAT TRANSFER OVER GLASSES. SO WHAT IS THE REAL ANSWER- WHEN I TALK TALK KOREAN LANGUAGE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- OBVIOUSLY NO MATH NO ENGLISH WASN'T NECESSARY AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN. THE NEW FOREIGN LANGUAGE IS ALL. I WONDER WHAT BASED UPON THEIR DECLARED- THE MAJOR OR WHAT DIRECTION WHAT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPECIALIZED SO WE CAN MAKE A SOME CATEGORICAL REQUIREMENT SO REMEDIAL MATH ENGLISH MAY BE NECESSARY IF FOR LAWYERS OR WHATEVER WE NEED TO GOOD THINGS. NSIA THEY ARE TECHNOLOGY TO OVER NEED THE AT MATH KIA. OF OH OH I'M SORRY YEAH. SO YOU YOU CAN SEE IS MAY SO- IN REALLY NEED A GOOD SHOP- NOVARRO AND I'M K. OR US REAL OF WARREN AND NOT READ. SO YOU WITH ABOUT THAT THAT DIRECTION HOW YOU CAN. BASED UPON. WHICH DOES DOES WERE ABSOLUTE- WE AT ALL THOSE- AT. THAT DIDN'T THAT THAT REYES AND- ALL. SAY WHAT OKAY PROBABLY A TWO THIRDS OF THE OFF STATISTIC THAT YOU STATED THE NUMBER OF. THAT ARE-FEELING IS TAKEN OF CONTEXT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE MANY MANY MANY MORE STUDENTS THAT THAT. THAT DIDN'T MEDIA TO IT IN ANSWERABLE US THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THE P. NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT NOW PAY OUT OF PLAN. IT ASK PLACE IN OUR MEDIA AND THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT WITHOUT HELLO WHEN SEVEN OH PATH PACK WEEK SAID THE COULD BE KALRA. SO ADDITIONAL UNIT CLASSES TAKEN AT THE SAME TIME THAT HELPED ENHANCE THE LEARNING IN THOSE TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES WE HAVE MONEY FOR TUTORING SO STUDENTS CAN GET AT THE SAME TIME WHAT WE DON'T SO THEY COULD TAKE THE TUTORING AND HELP THEM- THAT HELP- THE- ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN A TRANSFER LEVEL CLASS WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS STUDENTS TAKING REMEDIAL CLASS AFTER MEDIAL CLASS AND NOT DOING ANY BETTER IN TRANSFER LEVEL CLASSES YOU. THE DATE IT SHOWS THAT THOSE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS OF THESE REMEDIAL CLASSES- DROPPED OUT. OR IF AND THEN THEY TRANSFERRED THEY THEY PASSED FRANCE FOR LEVEL CLASSES AT A MUCH LOWER RATE SO- I AGREE WITH ALL THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE- EXPRESSED AND WE THINK THAT WE'VE TRIED TO. ADDRESS ALL OF THE WITH. WITH SEVENTY FIVE I'M SURE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD YES. WHEN I MET. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE IS SHE RIGHT SO WHEN YOU HEAR IS THE LIKE THAT A HIGH THOUSAND STUDENTS DID NOT PLASTER TRANSFER LOW LEVEL COURSES ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WAS SAYING OF THESE STUDENTS- WHO WE- JUST WOULDN'T SEEN IN TRANSFER LEVEL. RIGHT WE HAD SOMEONE POPPING. THEY WERE. STUCK IN BDO RIGHT NOW THEY WERE SAYING STUDENTS TRANSFER LEVEL IT IS TRUE NOT ALL STUDENTS WILL PASS A TRANSFERABLE COURSE ON THEIR PERSON M- BUT RESEARCH SHOWING THAT EVEN FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO TAKE. AND LEVEL. ON THEIR TAMPA ARTIST. TAKING LIKELY TO PASSED HAD STAR IN REMEDIAL AT. AND SO TO GET TO HEART OF WHAT HEAR YOU EXPRESS WHICH IS OF CONCERN- DOT CHOI IT'S IT REALLY THE- OF YES STUDENTS COME WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PREPARATION- WHAT AB SEVEN OH FIVE IS MAKING CLEAR IN AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE. UNTIL TO. CLEAR WHILE. BROUGH BUT WE HAVE NOT THE ANSWER THAT PROBLEM SO WHAT IS THE M. GETS THE THING. OTHER EVEN WITH AB SEVENTY OH FIVE FOCUS STUDENT SUPPORT IN TRANSFER LEVEL AND- WE'VE DONE SOME OF THAT WORK THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL LEDGES- BUT WE HAVE JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN AND WILL DO. TO ENHANCE STUDENT SUPPORTS WELL IN TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES ALSO THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SEE EVEN SOME OF THOSE CONCERNING NUMBERS DIMINISH. THEM IS SUMMARIZE. IT JUST OF. IT ADDS A SENSE OF THE- BOB PASS RATE THE- WHEN THEY PLUNGE. THE REAR OF COURSE UP- WOULD BE HIGHER. THAN THROUGH THE REMEDIAL CLASSES SO WHO ARE NOT GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO US AND SELL REMEDIAL CLASSES ALFA. RESENTED THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO LET'S GIVE IT A TRY HERE YOU KNOW I COME FROM IN A NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY MUST OFFER. I FINISHED MY IN A COLLEGE AND INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND A BUT I HAD THE THROUGH THE MONTHS OF- ENGLISH ORIENTATION PROGRAM. OUT WITHOUT ANY SUCH PREPARATION IF I JUMPED INTO IT THE I MIGHT HAVE VALUE I DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A LOT LONGER SO THE ORIENTATION LANGUAGE PROGRAM. I DIDN'T HELP US SO I THINK THAT THAT WAS ALL REGIONAL INTENT DOUBLE REMEDIAL CLASSES UP BUT THAT THIS HAS- DRENCH THE TOO LONG AND THE- CONSEQUENCES TO WERE NOT THE REALLY- RESULTING IN A GOOD DIRECTION SO- STATISTICALLY- PASS RATE WHEN THEY JUMP INTO THE ACTUAL CLASSES- DEPENDING UPON WHAT CLASSES SAID THEY ARE TAKING THE SUCCESS RATE. HI LESTER SOME I GET MY- CORRECT. AND NOT ALL AND SIMPLE OF. I HAVE A CUP OF QUESTIONS- SO OH FIVE. DIDN'T GET RID OF REMEDIAL CLASSES IS THAT CORRECT. SO SEVEN SEVEN OH FIVE WHAT IT DID IS ALLOWED FOR USING OF VARIOUS MEASURES NOT JUST RELYING ON THE PLACEMENT TEST RIGHT TO PUT STUDENTS IN IN TWO CLASSES RIGHT BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I UNDERSTAND IS A- THAT. WE HAVEN'T SEEN- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- SUPPORT MOVES INTO THIS DIRECTION- ANALYSIS IS WOULD THAT BE A FAIR STATEMENT. THERE'S MANY A COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAVE FULLY EMBRACED OF SEVEN OH FIVE AND THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THOSE COLLEGES ARE REALLY ASTOUNDING BUT THERE ARE STILL- GROUPS OF COLLEGES THAT HAVE NOT OF FULLY EMBRACED- SEVEN OH FIVE BUT YEAH OBVIOUSLY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE YES IT IS IF I CAN ADD TO THAT I WOULD SAY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DID FULLY LEAN INTO IMPLEMENTING EIGHTY SEVEN OH FIVE TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW. INSTANT WITH THE STRICT. AND WOULD PLACEMENT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE ADDITION OF THE LANGUAGE AROUND ENROLLMENT IN AB SEVENTEEN OH FIVE- SO IN SOME INSTANCES IT WAS AN APPROACH OF WELL THE OPTION IS THERE A STUDENTS CAN BE PLACED THERE- BUT IT IS LEFT OPEN I WOULD SAY TOO MANY DOORS- TO ONE STUPID CHOICE SO THAT STUDENTS WERE STILL IN. IN THESE COURSES AND IF DIDN'T OR THEY FISH WELL. THEY WERE THERE WAS LIMITATION THE COLLEGES THAT- BUT THERE DE ROOM FOR. MORE TOWARDS THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW AND WHAT IT SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BILL AND SEVEN OH FIVE IS WHAT. THE STRONG FOCUS ON NOT JUST PLACEMENT BUT ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY FLAGGING THAT THE DESIRE OF THIS BILL IS NOT SIMPLY THAT STUDENTS HAVE AN OPTION- THAT THEY COULD BE PLACE BUT THAT UP YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENSURING. THAT WE ARE COUNSELING THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ARE ROLLING IN THE COURSES THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM I'D ALSO BRING SOME IMPORTANT CLARITY ABOUT WHERE THE SUPPLIES IN WHERE IT DOESN'T BECAUSE THERE WAS CONFUSION. WITH IN BUILD UP THAT'S CLEARED FOR- IT ALSO BRINGS- IN IMPORTANT FLAG TOWARD CONCURRENT SUPPORT AND ALLOWING COLLEGES TO REQUIRE CONCURRENT SUPPORT A WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT CHANGED AS WELL. I'M GONNA. IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO SPOKE IN THE OPPOSITION WHO WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO MY QUESTION. AS TO WHY COLLEGES HAVE NOT. MORE READILY EMBRACE. SEVEN OH FIVE. OR SUPPORTED THE SENTIMENT THE FEELING BEHIND SEVEN OH FIVE. SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THERE IS THAT SENTIMENT OR FEELING BEHIND THAT- THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS WORKED WITH FACULTY STATEWIDE UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT AB SEVEN OH FIVE FACULTY ARE IN FULL SUPPORT IN GETTING STUDENTS AND COUNSELING THEM INTO TAKING THOSE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES. BUT WE DO HAVE STUDENTS THAT HELP FOR SOME REASON THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON SUCH A FULL LOAD OF HAVING TO TAKE A TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE IN ADDITION TO A SUPPORT COURSE OR THE EXTRA WORKLOAD THAT'S REQUIRED. TAKING JUNE MAY HAVE CHILDREN CARE FOR THEY MAY HELP PARENTS TO CARE FOR. THEY THEY JUST DO'T HELP THE TIME SOME STUDENTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY WANT TO EASE BACK IN. WE'RE LOSING OUR STUDENTS IS. THE COLOR AND WE WERE HEARING FROM OUR FACULTY THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS WERE HEARING FROM THOSE STUDENTS. THEY CAN'T CALL IN AND GIVE YOU TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW BUT BUT WE BUT I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE STUDENTS. BOB I REQUIRED TO TAKE A TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS HELLO BUT MOST ALL REQUIREMENTS CAN BE MET WITH THE TRANSFER LEVEL COURSE AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF WHAT I'M DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THAT WE GIVE STILL MANY WAYS TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS BUT WITH THIS BILL STUDENTS WOULD BE COLLEGE. UP TO RALPH. FOR LEVEL INSTEAD OF THE PRE TRANSFER LEVEL THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS. I FULLY APPRECIATE WANTING TO PREPARE STUDENTS IN CASE DAY THEY WANT TO GO TO TRANSFER INSTITUTION. I'M REALLY.

AB TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN MINIMIZES THE CHANCE THAT A STUDENT IS DEAD NAMES WHILE ATTENDING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BY ENSURING THAT STUDENTS AND FACULTY WHO ARE ATTENDING A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN DESIGNATE THEIR OF FIRMS WERE CHOSEN NAME AND PRONOUNS WHILE ATTENDING A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. USE OF A STUDENTS ASSIGNED AT BIRTH NAME RATHER THAN THEIR CHOSEN OR AFFIRM TO NAME IS KNOWN AS DEAD NAMING. SPECIFICALLY FOR TRANSGENDER OR NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS BEING DEAD NAMES BY INCORRECT STUDENT RECORDS CAN LEAD TO UNWANTED OUTING. BULLYING DISCRIMINATION VIOLENCE AND A LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES BY REQUIRING FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO UPDATE THEIR INTERNAL SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE ANY INDIVIDUAL'S OR FIRM'S NAME AND IDENTIFY THEIR PRONOUNS OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM CAN AVOID THE ACT OF DEAD NAME. THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN TODAY TOMMY MARTIN LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR A QUALITY CAL. AND STEPHANIE GOLDMAN THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR THEY WILL BE READING STATEMENTS FROM OUR WITNESSES WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO BE HERE IN PERSON TODAY MAYBE IN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRIN COMMITTEE MEMBERS TOMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL WHICH ENHANCES- THIS LEGISLATURE'S RECORD OF I ENSURING THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS AND GRADUATES HAVE ACADEMIC RECORDS THAT REFLECT THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES- THE OTHER AUTHOR MENTION I'LL BE SHARING TESTIMONY FROM ONE OF OUR WITNESSES WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY AND PERSON. SHE SAYS GOOD AFTERNOON SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M ERIN POLLARD THE MANAGER OF STUDENT EQUITY AT IRVINE VALLEY COLLEGE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN IRVINE CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELOR AND HAVE SPECIALIZED IN GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR TRANS AND NON BINARY PERSONS FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. I LED THE CREATION OF A NAME INCLUSIVITY PROGRAM IN MY DISTRICT AND I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING PRONOUN OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS I ALSO TEACH AND TRAIN OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND HOW TO CREATE THESE PROGRAM. FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF CREATING AND USING THESE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS WITNESSING THEIR IMPACT ON OUR QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS CRITICAL TO CREATING SAFE CAMPUSES FOR OUR TRANS AND NON BINARY STUDENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND THAT ACCESS TO EASILY CHANGE ONE'S NAME THROUGHOUT THEIR CAMPUS SYSTEMS. IS A SAFETY AND PRIVACY ISSUE FOR OUR TRANS AND NON BINARY STUDENTS. THIS IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT COMFORT OR PREFERENCE. OUTING A STUDENT BY USING THEIR LEGAL NAME OR DIED NAME CAN PUT OUR TRANSCENDENCE AND REAL PHYSICAL DANGER. AT RISK FOR HARASSMENT BY OTHERS HAVE SERIOUS SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. IN FACT THIS IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE WHICH STATES THAT A TRANSGENDER OR GENDER NONCONFORMING STUDENT. MAY NOT EXPRESS THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OPENLY AND ALL CONTACTS INCLUDING AT HOME. REVEALING A STUDENT'S GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION TO OTHERS MAY COMPROMISE THIS. THUS PRESERVE. PRIVACY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THE RIGHT OF TRANSGENDER STUDENTS TO KEEP THEIR TRANSGENDER STATUS PRIVATE IS GROUNDED IN CALIFORNIA'S ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS AS WELL AS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. AND WHILE MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE VOLUNTARILY CREATED NAME INCLUSIVITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR UNOFFICIAL FIRST NAME AND CAMPUS SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO ADD THEIR PERSONAL PRONOUNS MANY HAVE NOT. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BRING THE REST OF THE CCC SYSTEM INTO ALIGNMENT WITH OUR SYSTEM VALUES OF PROTECTION WELL G. B. T. Q. PLUS STUDENTS. WE MUST ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THE CATASTROPHIC PERSONAL IMPACTS OF BEING OUTED AND A NAMES ON OUR CAMPUSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON STEPHANIE GOLDMAN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. I'M READING THIS TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF OUR WITNESS WHO CANNOT ATTEND IN PERSON TODAY. MY NAME IS HOW CAN I GO AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND COUNTY'S OFFICE OF TRANSGENDER INITIATIVES I'M ALSO PART OF. PART TIME FACULTY AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE I TEACH IN THE HEALTH EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS. I'M TESTIFYING BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN BECAUSE THIS BILL IS UTTERLY AT LIFESAVING. FOR TRANSGENDER NON BINARY CALIFORNIANS AS IT AFFORDS GENUINE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE SAD REALITY IS THAT TODAY AND EVERY DAY ACROSS COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES ARE OUTED AS TRANSGENDER. DEAD NAMED HARASSED AND ULTIMATELY EXCLUDED FROM EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR TRANS GENDER NON BINARY PEOPLE SYSTEMATIC THAT NAMING IS SO HARMFUL THAT WE LEAVE CLASS AND NEVER RETURN. FURTHER BEING DEAD MEMES MAKES US TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE FOR. 22% OF COLLEGE OF OCCASIONAL SCHOOL STUDENTS. WERE OUT OR PERCEIVED AS TRANSGENDER IN CALIFORNIA ARE VERBALLY PHYSICALLY AND OR SEXUALLY HARASSED BECAUSE OF BEING TRANSGENDER. BEING EXCLUDED FROM EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS MEANS BEING SHUT OUT FROM ECONOMIC STABILITY BECAUSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OFTEN THE ONLY AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE WAY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GAIN. THE EDUCATION NEEDED TO FURTHER OUR CAREERS. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT OUR COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES UNEMPLOYMENT AND MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE RATE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTEEN WILL ELIMINATE THE PERVASIVE DEAD NAMING OF TRANSCEND NINE BEARING EVERY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES ASSIST PLACE HONOR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES CORRECT NAMES AND PRONOUNS. MAKING SAFER. I'M EXAGGERATING WHEN I THE THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES I WORKED IN THE TRANSGENDER ADVOCACY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND I'VE WITNESSED IN MY COMMUNITY THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES BEING EXCLUDED. FROM EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS I PERSONALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN TRANSIT NINE VERY MERRY STAFF STUDENTS AND FACULTY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FEEL SAFE COMING TO CLASS. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT COME TO THE MICROPHONE. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS SAID DAVID HAWKINS CALIFORNIA COLLEGE INDEPENDENT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ALSO IN SUPPORT.

NANCY WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. AGAIN ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY ANY TWEETERS. I SEE NINE ACTIONS COMMENTS FROM- THE DICE FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK THERE ARE I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT YOUR BILL IS- INTENDING TO DO I WONDER- AS SHE IS SO HAS THERE BEEN ANY PROBLEM. HI I THINK WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MANY FEEL ABOUT BEING OUTED BEING BULLIED AND WHEN WE DON'T UP PROPRIA LEAVE REFLECT THE NAME THEY WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED. BY IN TO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESPECT PEOPLE'S WISHES ON HOW THEY WISH TO BE ADDRESSED. AT THE TIME OF- APPLICATION COLLEGE APPLICATION THE STATE. YOUR NAME AND THE GENDER. RIGHT WHY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL. DO THEY HAVE TO CHANGE I BELIEVE WE SAW AN ADVANTAGE AND THERE WAS A SILVER LINING FROM THE PANDEMIC WHERE MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE PARTICIPATING IN ONLINE SCHOOL WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. WERE ABLE TO NAME THEMSELVES AND PLACE THEIR PRONOUNS IN THEIR SCREEN IN THEIR BOX THAT IS NEW AND DIFFERENT THAN HOW WE WERE TRADITIONALLY TEACHING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND MANY STUDENTS FOUND COMFORT IN THAT IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND- USED THEIR CHOSEN NAME AS WELL AS THEIR CHOSEN PRONOUNS AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT SILVER LINING FOR US TO CAPTURE FROM THE SPEND. MAKE AT ALL TO MILLIE STUDENTS FELT SAFER WHEN THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THEIR OWN AFFIRM TODAY. SO STRANGE. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I BELIEVE YOU'RE BUILDING ON OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE- MR CHU. AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT I THINK THIS BILL MAKES SENSE AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. THANK YOU. YEAH OKAY. SO WE WILL NOW MOVE. TO- ITEM NINE FILE ITEM NINE MISS SAID WANT THIS. FOR CAN WE DETER GOALS. OKAY I'M RESERVE FUND GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE TODAY I DO WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER ARE ALL OF THEIR DILIGENT WORKING ASSISTANCE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I AM ASKING THAT THIS COMMITTEE AMEND THIS BILL TO REFLECT THE LANGUAGE OUTLINED ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. AS AMENDED AB TWENTY CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND REQUEST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO REQUIRE EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES. THAT PROVIDE STUDENT HOUSING TO POST% DATA ON STUDENT HOUSING INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON THE HOUSING WAIT LISTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS AT EACH CAMPUS. ON EACH CAMPUS IS WEBSITE. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES FOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE WILL ALSO REQUIRE EACH SEGMENT TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE COMPILING THIS DATA FOR THEIR ENTIRE SEGMENT. OUR STATE HAS GENERALLY STARTED MEETING STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS AS A RESPONSIBILITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER SINCE CAMPUSES DO NOT REGULARLY ORIGINALLY PROVIDE DATA ON OCCUPANCY RATES IN A WEIGHTLESS FOR STUDENT HOUSING ON THE CAMPUS TO CAMPUS BASIS WE ARE UNAWARE OF WHETHER OR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING OUR MEETINGS THOSE HOUSING NEEDS. ACCORDING TO AN L. A- REPORT FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES YOU REPORTED THIRTEEN CAMPUSES WHAT WAIT LISTS TOTALING EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS DR YOUR IS UP FROM A WAIT LIST OF FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINETEEN. IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE EIGHT UC CAMPUSES REPORTED WAIT LIST TOTALING MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. SOME CAMPUS SUPPORT WEIGHTLESS CREASES ABOVE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. THIS BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THIS LEGISLATURE INTO OUR STUDENTS BY ENSURING THAT THIS IMPORTANT DATA IS REGULARLY UPDATED AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. THIS WILL ALSO THIS WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO EXERCISE PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. ACCURATELY ASSESS EACH CAN ASSIST STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY FINANCIALLY UNDER RESOURCE STUDENTS ALSO NEED MORE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO MAKE WELL INFORMED HOUSING DECISIONS. AT THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES THIS WILL HELP ELIMINATE FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION EXPERIENCED BY STUDENTS ON A HOUSING CAMPUS A WAITING LIST. AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE HOUSING OPTIONS THE TRANSPARENCY PROVIDED BY THIS BILL WILL ONLY IMPROVE OUR POLICY MAKING AND THIS LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE GOOD HEALTH DECISIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. I WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOT SEEN ANY ANY WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION ANY WITH ANY ANY- IN THE HEARING ROOM WOULD WANT TO. SPEAKING SUPPORT NOPE AND NONE IN THE HEARING ROOM ON A SPEAKING OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS NO. OKAY WE GOT SOMEBODY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR SHARE MEMBERS TO TENDER MOLLY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL AT THIS TIME BUT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. TO WORK OUT WORK WITH THEM ON THIS LEGISLATION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND WE WILL BRING IT UP WHEN WE HAVE A REPORT. I THINK YOU HAVE ONE MORE BILL TO PRESENT FILE ITEM TEN A. B. TWENTY FOUR NINETY ONE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS BILL IS VERY SIMILAR TO MY EIGHTY. SEVEN TEN FROM TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY THREE YEARS AGO IN RECENT YEARS THE COST TO ATTEND COLLEGE HAS GROWN. AT A RATE FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION. FOR STUDENTS THAT OUR PUBLIC HEART EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HOUSING AND OTHER NON. I TUITION EXPENSES MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. THE ACCESSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT DATA WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS ON THE PERSPECTIVE COST OF ATTENDANCE INFLUENCES THE CHOICES THEY MAKE ABOUT WHICH COLLEGE TO ATTEND WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE LOANS TO PAY FOR THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION. UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE IS NO STANDARD SYSTEM WIDE PROCESS TO CALCULATE HOUSING COSTS COLLEGES HAVE CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION IN THIS pAREA. THIS LACK OF ACCURATE AND READILY ACCESSIBLE INCONSISTENT HOUSING COSTS DATA MEANS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY COMPARE. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING SHOULD BE UPDATING THEIR HOUSING COSTS ON A FREQUENT BASIS IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THE STATE'S EVER FLUCTUATED HOUSING MARKET. ONLY THEN WILL OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCURATE COST. OF ATTENDANCE INFORMATION. THERE IS NO SMALL MATTER AN ACCURATE DATA ON STUDENT ON HOUSING COSTS WILL LEAD TO PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT STUDENTS TO MAKE AN ACCURATE BUDGET BUDGETING DECISIONS. THIS CAN LEAD STUDENTS EITHER COME UP SHORT OR ABLE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE OR LEAD STUDENTS TO TAKE ON MORE LOANS AND THEY NEED. LEADING TO EXCESSIVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THIS PROGRAM DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MANY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO LIKE WE DO NOT HAVE THE UNLIMITED RESOURCES. AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO FIND THEIR DREAMS OF ATTENDING. A COLLEGE. AND TIE AND ATTAINING A COLLEGE DEGREE. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY ONE WILL HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING TO USE THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT. OF HOUSIG AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FAIR MARKET RENTS DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM TO STANDARDIZE THE HOUSING COSTS FOR STUDENTS. PURSUANT TO FEDERAL LAW HI TO HAS RELIABILITY. PUBLISHED ANNUAL UPDATE TO THE FAIR HOUSING RENT SYSTEM SINCE FOR THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS. THE FAIR MARKET IN. MARKET RENTS DATA IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND MORE ACCURATELY PORTRAYS A COST FOR HOUSING AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THEN STUDENT SURVEYS. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE PRICED OUT OF THEIR COLLEGE DREAMS OR FORCED TO TAKE OUT MORE LOANS AND THEY NEED BECAUSE WE- ARE THE STATE HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ACCURATE DATA ON HOUSING. ON HOUSING CROSS ACROSS THE STATE THIS BILL WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. AS WE HELP PAINT AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEN THEY THAT THEY PERSONALLY NEED TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE COMMENCEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN THE HEARING ROOM ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY POINTERS. C. NINE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. C. NINE I THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THE BILL FORWARD AND I WOULD ASK IF SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SEGMENTS- TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS CERTAINLY AND WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR TO VOTE.

BROUGHT TURMOIL TO THE UKEE INDIAN PEOPLE. HOWEVER THE DAILY MEANS THAT HASTINGS USED TO BUILD HIS WEALTH AND HOW FUN FOUND THE LAW SCHOOL HAS RECEIVED LITTLE SCRUTINY UNTIL NOW. STARTING IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THE SCHOOL AGREED TO MOVE FORWARD TO SEPARATE FROM THE NAME OF HASTINGS SINCE THAT POINT IN TIME I HAVE COORDINATED TEN MEETINGS THAT HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD THE COLLABORATION OF DISCUSSION WITH ROUND VALLEY INDIAN TRIBES THE U. K. INDIAN. IN THE LAW SCHOOL ALTOGETHER WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN A PATH. FOR TOO LONG THE VOICES OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS THAT CENTER AROUND HISTORIC TRAUMA. IN ACTIONS INFLICTED UPON THEM DURING THE STATE'S HISTORY. AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX INSURERS THAT THE VOICE OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE ARE AT THE TABLE TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. BACK IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT NO ONE IN THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE UKEE AROUND VALLEY TRIBAL PEOPLE IT HASTINGS WAS A GOOD NAME FOR THE LAW SCHOOL. AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX FOR THE FIRST TIME INSURERS THAT THE VOICE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS IS PRESENT TO ADDRESS AND SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE COMPONENTS THAT ARE NEEDED.

AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WILL CONTINUE THIS WORK. MY OWN CLAN THERE YOU HAVE IT THEN PEOPLE OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY WAS ALMOST EXTERMINATED GEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX IN THIS ERA IN THE SAMBAR DINO MOUNTAINS SO IT IS PERSONAL TO ME TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE HAVE A VOICE AT THE TABLE. MANY TIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTINUED IMPACT OF THAT TRAUMA WITH KNOWLEDGE MENT OF THE HORDE PASSED AND THAT HAVING OUR PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WILL ESTABLISH A MUTUAL RESPECT. AND SAID OF COURSE TOWARDS A POSITIVE FUTURE. THE PROCESS MAY TAKE TIME BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S TAKEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS FOR US TO REACH THIS POINT TODAY. THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN SIMPLY MOVING ON OR CHANGING THE LETTER HEAD OR THE NAME ON THE LETTERHEAD. IT IS ABOUT HELPING TO BUILD A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. ITS INSTITUTIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S FIRST PEOPLE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. ARE THE COMPONENTS- WITH ME IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT.

MY NAME IS RICHARD FLYER I AM A JUDGE SUPERIOR COURT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RETIRED- I AM ALSO A HASTINGS A LOAN FROM A NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. I'M IN FAVOR OF RESTORATIVE pPROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE JUST. MENDOCINO COUNTY. HOWEVER I AM AGAINST THE RENAMING OF MY LAW SCHOOL. WHICH IS PART OF THIS BILL. THIS PART OF THE PROPOSED BILL IS ILL ADVISED AND FAULTY. FIRST IT WON'T RESTORE ANYTHING TO THE NATIVE AMERICANS IN WILL CERTAINLY ANTAGONIZE SOME OF THE GRADUATES OF LAW SCHOOL. NEXT IS ONLY BECAUSE JEALOUSY IN BICKERING BETWEEN THE TRIBES THE SCHOOL AND EVEN THE TWO HOUSES OF YOUR LEGISLATURE. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TWO COMPETING BILLS YOUR BILL AND THE BILL IN THE SENATE ON THIS VERY RENAMING. SOME OF THE TRIED MEMBERS THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO- TO DEAN FAGAN AT OUR LAST MEETING THEMSELVES DO NOT EVEN WANT TO RENAMING. THIRD THE RENAMING IS BASED UPON FALSE FACTS AND INFORMATION. CHIEF JUSTICE HASTINGS WHO IS THE FIRST CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DIDN'T KILL ANY NATIVE AMERICANS ALL OF HIS OPINIONS WRITTEN OPINIONS BY THE SUPREME COURT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT HE DID IS A ATTORNEY GENERAL SO A DISCONCERTING NEED A COUNTY WERE IN FAVOR OF NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS. AND USING HIM AS A NINETEENTH CENTURY SCAPEGOAT WILL REDUCE THE CREDIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS BILL. LASTLY THIS RENAMING PORTION OF THE BILL. IS ILLEGAL AND WILL LEAD TO LITIGATION WHICH WILL DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. FOR ALL THSE REASONS I WOULD URGE YOU TO DELETE THE LAW SCHOOL RENAMING PROVISION OF A BILL.

NATIVE AMERICANS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA REMOVING THAT NAME FROM- AND IN THE COMMENTS I HAD ON THAT BILL THAT WAS ABOUT- FINING ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE REMEMBER GENOCIDE WE SEARCH FOR THAT ACCOUNTABILITY- EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T HAD IT IN EXPERIENCED IT YET- AND SO I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THAT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD- ALSO TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS AND WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY ABLE TO IMPLEMENT- IN A TIMELY MANNER. TO CONTINUE.

YOU HAD A LOT OF THINGS I DON'T WANNA ELONGATED FURTHER BUT- IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER AND TO SOMETIMES VOICE OUT. OF THE- CHOOSE IN A PRAGMATIC SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE SAME EVENTS DON'T OCCUR AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING ISSUES APPROPRIATELY AND HOLDING TO BETTER ACCOUNT THE PERPETRATORS- HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU. WILL BRING IT UP- WHEN ONCE WE HAVE A CORE SO WITH THAT WE'LL GO TO FILE ITEM TWENTY TWO A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN. AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND ON THIS SPECIFIC BILL THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND TO YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH ME AND- SPENDING TIME- THEN AS JUST YET LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO- EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN WILL STILL FOCUS ON IMPOSING A COST ON ACTORS. WHO ARE DESTROYING THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF OTHER NATION STATES- BUT WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE CORE INTENT- THIS BILL WILL NARROW ITS FOCUS TO THE SPECIFIC PRECEDENT SETTING PROVISIONAL ORDER THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE RECENTLY ISSUED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TO AYE ICJ ISSUED A PROVISIONAL ORDER AGAINST AZERBAIJAN REQUIREMENT THAT THEY TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO PREVENT AND PUNISH. THE VANDALISM IN AFFECTING CULTURAL HERITAGE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CHURCHES AND OTHER PLACES OF WORSHIP. ATTENTION NEVER REALLY IMPACT ACADEMIC AND THEREFORE WE WILL BE MAKING THE PROHIBITION ON CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES INVITING A SPONSOR PROFESSOR OF PERMISSIVE WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO FURTHER DEFINE THE UNDER DEFINED TERMS IN THE BILL AND AMEND THE LANGUAGE SO THAT MUSEUMS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE JUDGMENT- THESE CHANGES WILL BE MADE PRIOR TO THE APPROPRIATIONS HEARING. AND THE CALIFORNIA HAS. HAS A PLACE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS BILL WAS CALIFORNIA'S PLACE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE TO SET US SET SANCTIONS COUNTRIES THAT ACT CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES BY LIMITING THE ACCESS TO OUR SOUGHT AFTER CULTURAL SPACES. HOLD TO STOP. OF JUSTICE FOR TO WITH THAT AGAIN I'M JOINED BY MISTER ME ONTO MY CHEN FROM THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA VS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN UP AS A STUDENT OF HISTORY. I'D LIKE TO ADD SOME CONTEXT HISTORICAL CONTEXT TO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARE IN- JUST JUST THE STATED OF THE GOVERNMENT OF AZERBAIJAN SPECIFICALLY HAS A HISTORY OF COVERING UP. ITS STATE SPONSORED ERASURE OF INDIGENOUS ARMENIAN CULTURAL HERITAGE ON TERRITORIES THAT IT CURRENTLY CONTROLS AZERBAIJAN'S ENOUGH EACH OF ON EXCLAVE IS A CASE IN POINT. A SEMINAL FORENSIC STUDY PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN BY HISTORIANS SIMON MCKEON AND SERRA PICKMAN TRACKED AZERBAIJAN'S DESTRUCTION OF EIGHTY NINE MEDIEVAL ARMENIAN CHURCHES FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY INTRICATECROSS STONES AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TOMBSTONES WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH METICULOUS DATA THANKS TO THE PAINSTAKING EFFORTS OF HISTORIAN ARE DUMB I BOSNIAN WHO DECADES EARLIER ANTICIPATED THE ERADICATION OF ARMENIAN RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL RELICS. IN THE KNUCKEY TAVON EXCLAVE. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY AZERBAIJAN'S DYNASTIC ALI A FAMILY DICTATORSHIP NOTORIOUS FOR EXECUTING A COMPLEX GLOBAL MONEY LAUNDERING OPERATION IN MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SLUSH FUND KNOWN AS THE AZERBAIJANI LAUNDROMAT. GOT AWAY SCOT FREE WITH ITS COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF ARMENIAN CULTURAL HERITAGE THAT IT BROUGHT ENOUGH EACH OF ON DESPITE CLEAR VIDEO EVIDENCE CAPTURING BEFORE AND AFTER FOOTAGE OF THE DEVASTATION. AND WITH IMPUNITY THE ALI IBRAHIM HAS EMBARKED ON A SIMILAR STATE CONCEIVED CAMPAIGN OF ERASURE AND DESTRUCTION IN PARTS OF THE ARTSAKH REPUBLIC. FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE GOING TO KARA HAT AZERBAIJANI FORCES SUPPORTED BY THE TURKISH MILITARY AS WELL AS TO HOW TO CANARIES FROM SYRIA OVERRAN DURING THE FORT FORTY ONE. ON ARTS UP IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WITH THAT CONTEXT UP. OF THE COULD THE CURRENT BILL AB EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE DID SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED BACK IN DECEMBER OF. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE CASE ARMENIA VERSES AZERBAIJAN WHERE CALLED UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF AZERBAIJAN TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO PREVENT AND PUNISH ACTS OF VANDALISM AND DESECRATION AFFECTING ARMENIAN CULTURAL HERITAGE. THE ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT THE I. C. J. DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE SUCH PROVISIONAL ORDERS THAT THE ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ALSO ON STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHICH IS A BEACON. FOR MORALITY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS LED THE WAY ON EVERYTHING FROM DIVESTMENT SOUTH AFRICA OF DAVID LED THE WAY BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A TESTAMENT FOR SOUTH AFRICA- AND CERTAINLY. SPENT WITH TWO TRIPS GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BONDS AND ASSETS WITH WHICH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LED. IN THE PREVIOUS UP. CYCLE SO WITH ALL THAT FOR ALL THOSE REASONS ABOVE THE ARMY ASSEMBLY SUPPORTS THE PASSAGE OF AB AB FIFTEEN A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.

THEATER NO OF OUR VALUES SO THIS IS THIS IS IN SOME WAYS A PRECEDENT SETTING OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HERE IN.

THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBER'S MARK MCDONALD- MGI ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CONTRA COSTA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THE CHANCELLOR'S OF THE- THE- SPONSORS OF THE BILL- THE CHANCELLOR COULD NOT BE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT SO I'M GOING TO READ- A- STATEMENT THAT SHE- SHE PER PREPARED BUT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOUR STEP. FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH US IN MAKING IT A BETTER BILL IT. TREMENDOUS WORK- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT LIKE SO MANY ACROSS THE STATE IS FACING ENROLLMENT CHALLENGES IT IS NOT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROVIDE RATHER THE PAN HAS CREATED NEW BARRIERS THAT ARE CAUSING STUDENTS TO DROP OUT OR TAKE A FEW SEMESTERS OFF OR THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO PRIORITIZE HIGHER EDUCATION. THEY NEED IN ORDER. A GOOD PAYING JOB WE NEED TO FIND NEW CREATIVE AND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REACH POTENTIAL STUDENTS AND AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN AS PART OF THAT SOLUTION. LAST YEAR WE BEGAN A TWO PRONG STRATEGY TO ADDRESS OUR ENROLLMENT CHALLENGES FIRST WE THOUGHT A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PETER HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO OBTAIN CONTACT INFORMATION FOR TENTH AND TELL TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS SO THAT WE CAN INFORM THEM OF THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR DUAL ENROLLMENT. SECOND SENSE SO MUCH OF OUR WORK AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS DEDICATED TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE DECIDED TO PARTNER WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO SEEK A SIMILAR OUTRAGE SHEPHERD REACHING OUT TO SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. FOSTER WITH. UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED OR JUSTICE INVOLVED LIKE MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THESE ARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE OFTEN PREYED UPON BY FOR PROFIT PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND ULTIMATELY RACK UP HUGE DEBT. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE DATA MINING BUT RATHER AS AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ENROLLMENT PURPOSES ONLY WE TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF THE INFORMATION SERIOUSLY OUR GOAL IS TO REACH OUT AND ENCOURAGE THESE POTENTIAL STUDENT POPULATIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GREAT INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT SERVICES OFFERED BY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON DANA NICKEL WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. OUR CLIENTS- SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE THE AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA AMVETS DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDER VETERANS COUNCIL MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AMERICAN THE VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA. THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY THE MILITARY FACE A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE WHEN DISCHARGING FROM THE MILITARY. THEY STOOD UP TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS BY MAKING A COMMITMENT TO DUTY. THEY DID THIS AT A TIME IN OUR LIVES WHEN MOST EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE ATTENDING COLLEGE BURNING TRADES IN BUILDING RESUMS. UPON SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE THESE VETERANS MUST RE INTEGRATE INTO THE CIVILIAN WORLD. HOWEVER THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ONE OF THE MOST OF. EVEN AFTER THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY. A POLICY WHICH ALLOWED MANY VETERANS TO BE THE FIRST ONES TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THEIR FAMILY. VAST NUMBERS OF WORLD WAR TWO KOREA AND VIETNAM VETERANS BECAME THE TEACHERS SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS DOCTORS NURSES AND TECHNICIANS. THE FUEL THE TECHNOLOGY BOOM AND BUILT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. THIS PROGRAM THE GI BILL STILL EXISTS IS BEEN IMPROVED AND EXPANDED. OVER THE YEARS. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER MANY OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE FOR VETERANS AS WELL AS CURRENT MILITARY MEMBERS TO ATTEND COLLEGE. HOWEVER LIKE MANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS THEY'RE OFTEN OBSCURED BY THE SHEER VOLUME OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION AGE. WHEN VETERANS GET OUT OF THE MILITARY. THEY ARE BUSY TRYING TO SECURE HOUSING TINA JOB GET THE KIDS IN THE LOCAL SCHOOLS CETERA. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN ONE HAS TO GET ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PERFORM DIRECT OUTREACH TO CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. INFORM THEM OF THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THANK YOU. YOU ANY OTHER WHO WANT TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN POSITION. ANY TWEETERS. C. NINE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YEAH WELL FIRST OF ALL I DO EXPRESS THE OTHER MY GRATITUDE FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL AND- DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN PREVENTIONS AND EDUCATION IS I THINK A PRIORITY AND THEN AS PART OF WHO WE ARE IN THE SELECTION. THE ONLY QUESTION OR I DO HAVE AN IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER IS- IS THERE KNOCKED OUT- IN THIS DAY AND AGE. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT. MY YOU KNOW ONE OF MY EMAIL ACCOUNTS THAT IS JUST MY JUNK ACCOUNT AND THERE'S LIKE FIVE THOUSAND EMAILS I NEED TO GO THROUGH IT I KNOW- BUT- IT DO WE GET. INUNDATED WITH SO MUCH INFORMATION I WANT TO KNOW IS THERE KNOCKED OUT- YES THERE IS A KNOCK OUT SO- THEY WILL. THEY WILL REACH OUT CONTACTS- THE LET'S SAY THE VETERAN AND THE VETERAN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT AT THAT POINT TO OPT OUT IN THE WILL. IF I WANTED THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE- COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE AND I WILL US UP AT PASS ON THAT THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE WENT. AND THANK YOU FOR EXPLODED. SO WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM TWENTY THREE. MISS PETRI NORSE. IF YOU'RE READY. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANTI GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS HAPPY TO JOIN YOU TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN EIGHTEEN ASSAULT ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A STRONG LEADER IN PROTECTING PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA MANY WOMEN IN OUR STATE LACK ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN FACT 40% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DON'T HAVE A SINGLE ABORTION PROVIDER. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE CORPS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION INSPIRED BY THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS THIS PROPOSAL WILL GREATLY STRENGTHEN OUR HEALTH CARE EDUCATION PIPELINE RECRUITING TRAINING AND RETAINING A DIVERSE WORK FORCE AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TRAINED IN REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES THEY WILL THEN BE ASSIGNED TO TEAMS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. PROUD TO ADD TO WORKING WITH A TERRIFIC. THESE NOW. ARE WITH FLOOR TO TEACH AN ZERO EIGHT CARRASCO AND OUR AND STUDENT NURSE MIDWIFE AT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU.

I AM THRILLED TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN CAUGHT BETWEEN NORRIS ON THIS BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A CALIFORNIA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE CORPS. THIS GREW OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURES OF ABORTION COUNTS AND THE HONOR OF SERVING AS CHAIR OF THE WORK FORCE WORKING GROUP. MODELED AFTER THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS ESTABLISHED FIFTY YEARS AGO AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN WOULD DO FOR ABORTION CARE ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THAT N. H. AS SEATED FOR PRIMARY CARE ACCESS IN ON. AREAS OTHER SHIPMENTS BY PENCE FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN CREATES EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS THAT MEET THE REAL NEEDS OF DIVERSE ASPIRING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WE CAN'T GET SERIOUS ABOUT DIVERSIFYING THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IF WE AREN'T WILLING TO INVEST UP FRONT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR CAREERS AND THE SOME FRONT INVESTMENT WILL ENSURE THEIR HEALTHCARE WORK. IS ABLE TO MEET THE DATE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATIONS SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART THE SHORTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ABORTION TRAINING GRADUATES OF THE TEACH PROGRAM ARE THE LUCKY FEW. THEY'RE PART OF JUST WERE GETTING ABORTION TRAINING THROUGH THEIR RESIDENCY. AND FOR ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES THIS TRAINING IS EVEN LESS ACCESSIBLE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ABORTION CARE- HAVE A VERY HARD TIME ACCESSING TRAINING THERE IS NO ACCESS WITHOUT PROVIDERS AND NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INVEST IN OUR CAPACITY. TO TRAIN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SO THEY CAN GAIN THE NECESSARY SKILLS THEY NEED TO PROVIDE ABORTION CARE MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT OR CONTRACEPTION. IT'S MEMBERS GET THE TRAINING THEY WANT PROVIDE CARE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA AND EXPAND ACCESS ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL.

THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHANG COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS- ACROSS GO I'M CURRENTLY IN MY LAST QUARTER OF MIDWIFERY PROGRAM AT UCSF. I'M EXPRESSING STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE CARDS AS A WAY TO INCREASE ABORTION ACCESS. IN CALIFORNIA. AS A NURSE MIDWIFE THERE ARE ALMOST NO AVENUES TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN ABORTION CARE. AS A STUDENT OR AFTERWARDS AS A PROFESSIONAL. UNFORTUNATELY LIMITATION ON OUR TRAINING HAS RESTRICTED MIDWIFE TO OFFER ABORTION AS PART OF THEIR CARE. IN MY TWO YEAR PROGRAM I HAD VERY LITTLE HANDS ON TRAINING. WE RECEIVED ONLY A NINETY MINUTE LECTURE AND MEDICAL ASPIRATION OF OPTION. ONE OUR RESTORATION. SKILLS SESSION AND ONE TWO TWO FOUR HOUR SHIFTS. AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL ABORTION CLINIC. THIS FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL IN PERSON TRAINING WERE MOSTLY OBSERVATION. IN MY EXPERIENCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WERE PRIORITIZE TO MEDICAL STUDENTS. REALLY STATE WE ARE QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE SAFE ABORTIONS. THIS CAR CITY OF ABORTION TRAINING CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS LED. MIDWEST IN OTHER ADVANCED NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO LEAVE THE STATE TO INCREASE OUR PORTION TRAINING. THE RELOCATION OF PROVIDERS TO OTHER STATES LEAVE THOSE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE I GREW UP MOST IN NEED. I PERSONALLY UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL CHART OF CONSEQUENCES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES I GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH A PROBABLY AN INCH OF FARMWORKERS. FOR THIS REASON IF I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE MY ABORTION TRAINING AND CALIFORNIA I WOULD HELP TO INCREASE ACCESS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN ADDITION. PROVIDE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL CONGRUENCY TO THE DIVERSE THAT THE NEXT POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA. PLEASE CONSIDER THE POSITIVE LONG TERM IMPACT TO THIS TO THIS REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE.

FILE ITEM. FILE ITEM FOURTEEN. THE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWO- THIS WILL CREATE A FIRST OF ITS KIND FIRST IN THE NATION LOAN FOR PROGRAM. KÞT TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE. COVERT NINETEEN THIRTIES TO ONCE IN A LIFETIME HEALTH CRISIS INTO AN ALREADY pPUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENT WITH A RESPONSE RESTING LARGELY ON LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC AND LEAD US TO THE AXIS OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IT AT LEAST CALIFORNIA RESULTING IN A HISTORIC LOSS OF PUBLIC HEALTH KNOWLEDGE. PUBLIC HEALTH EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE WORKED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC REPORT INCREASED INSTANCES OF ANXIETY DEPRESSION. HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR RETENTION INCENTIVES IN SUPPORT. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE INEQUITABLE BURDEN WITH VALLEY COUNTIES REPRESENTING MORE THAN TEN HIGHEST DEATH ATES FROM COVERT NINETEEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS REGION WHICH ALREADY HAS SOME OF THE LOWEST RATIO OF LICENSE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE AS THE CHAIRS WELL AWARE- AND ALSO REPRESENTS REGION- VERY SIMILAR. JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE CHALLENGES MERCED COUNTY WHERE I LIVE REPORTER 52% TURNOVER RATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF POSITIONS SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHEN YOU COMBINE ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND COUPLE IT WITH THE VALLEY'S HISTORIC ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE CLINICAL HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO EMPLOYER BASED. MOVEMENT NUMBER TEN. THESE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS ALLOW LICENSE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM TO WORK FOR DEFINED SERVICE PERIOD IN EXCHANGE FOR FULL. OR PARTIAL LOAN REPAYMENT OR EVEN LOAN FORGIVENESS. UNFORTUNATELY THESE PROGRAMS EXCLUDE ALL NON MEDICAL HEALTHCARE WORKERS INCLUDING THE MAJORITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH POSITIONS. RATHER THAN ASK PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS TO COMPETE FOR THE ALREADY OVER SUBSCRIBED RESOURCES PROVIDED TO THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWO WOULD GIVE THEM THEIR OWN PROGRAM DEDICATED TO THE QUARTERBACKS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK CMA MERCED COUNTY AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PUBLIC HEALTH CONSORTIUM WHO PUT IN THE LEGWORK TO HELP ME DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL.

CALIFORNIA ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS CREATED THROUGH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT TO SERVE WORKING ADULTS WITH NO POST SECONDARY CREDENTIALS TO SHORT TERM ONLINE PROGRAMS LINKED TO INDUSTRY NEEDS. CALIBRATE HASN'T ROLLED ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT ONLY EIGHTY HAVE COMPLETED A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. CALIBRATE ALSO REPORTED THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN STUDENTS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS SINCE THE COLLEGE WENT LIVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AFTER SPENDING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO LAUNCH COBB RIGHT COLLEGE THE SCHOOL REMAINS UNCREDITED AND HAS FAILED TO REACH THE ENROLLMENT GOALS AND OTHER BENCHMARKS. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIBRATE REPORTED OVER 60% OF ITS NEW ENROLLEES DROPPING OUT. WITH ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE AND ROWLEY'S AND SEVENTY NINE WITHDRAW WITHDRAWALS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL ENROLLMENT REMAINS AT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN EVEN WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FIFTEEN MILLION ONGOING ANNUAL FUNDS PAY FOR ONLY FIVE INSTRUCTORS. EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES ABLE TO QUICKLY RESPOND AND ADAPT TO COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC BY BY PROVIDING. ALMOST ALL OTHER COURSES ONLINE. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ABLE TO BUILD ON EXISTING ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPAND VIRTUAL RESOURCES TO HELP MEET THE VERY NEEDS OF THE OVER TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS ATTENDING A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THIS SESSION I HAVE MET WITH THE EXECUTIVE TEAM ITS CALIBER RIGHT AND I AM IMPRESSED BY THE RECENT WORK TO EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES AND BUILD ON THEIR EXISTING PROGRAMS. MOREOVER I UNDERSTAND THAT MORE STUDENTS IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS ARE COMPLETING THEIR PROGRAMS BUT EVEN SO. I REMAIN QUESTIONING I HAVE REMAINING QUESTIONS AROUND THE TRUTH FISCAL CLASS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE COLLEGE AND I'M STILL CONCERNED BY THE LACK OF DATA ON THEIR ON JOB PLACEMENT.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED TOWARDS CALIBRATE PRESENTLY COULD BE BETTER SERVED BEING FUNNELED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS- AND LASTLY IT WE JUST BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS FAILED TO MEET THE BENCHMARKS IN THE GOALS THAT IT WAS. STATED SAID TO TRY S. N. GIVEN THE ORDER FROM LAST YEAR AND THE LOWER AND- HE- A LACK OF CONNECTION WITH.

FURTHER WE TAKEN TO HEART AND ACCEPTED EACH OF THE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE STATE AUDITOR LAST SPRING. AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO THE- BILL ON THEIR FIRST. CALVET IS LESS THAN HALFWAY THROUGH IT STARTED PERIOD AND WE OPENED FOR ENROLLMENT ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. WE HAVE MET EVERY MILESTONE OUTLINED IN FOUNDING LEGISLATION WE ARE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON ACCREDITATION WE ARE GUIDED BY A BOARD APPROVED STRATEGIC VISION WHICH LAYS OUT AN AGGRESSIVE BUT ACHIEVABLE SET OF GOALS AND A CLEAR PATH FORWARD THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND BEYOND. CRITICALLY OUR STUDENT BODY REFLECTS THAT MISSION 92% OF OUR LEARNERS ARE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHICH IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SAYS. RIGHT 34% OR PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS AND MORE THAN TRIPLE A SYSTEM WIDE RATE 24% IDENTIFIES BLACK THIRTY THREE CENTS LET NEXT 19% IS EIGHT. THIS POP LEARNERS IS RARELY THE BENEFICIARY OF FOCUSED DATED. DRIVEN DESIGN AND RESEARCH. THERE SIX. ACROSS THE CAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT CAN GENERATE FOR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS TO EARN A CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE APPROVED CERTIFICATE. IS LESS THAN 6% THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROBLEM. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NUMBERS NATIONWIDE. ARE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION WEREN'T DESIGNED TO SERVE THESE COMMUNITIES OF LEARNERS THIS IS WHY WE'VE PARTNERED WITH UC IRVINE'S TOP RANKED SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. FOR MULTI YEAR RESEARCH PROJECT TO APPLY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND DATA ANALYTICS. TO ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE STUDENT LED I CALLED THE DR STRONG OUTCOMES FOR ADULT LEARNERS NOT JUST OF THE BENEFIT OF CALIBRATED ALSO TO THE BENEFIT OF THE SYSTEM. THE WHOLE.

THANK YOU PRESIDENT MINION AND GET GOOD EVENING GOOD AFTERNOON I GUESS IT IS EVENING BUT COME UP CHAIR MEDINA VICE CHAIR CHOI AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HI COMMITTEE ON THIRD ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION. AS THE CALPERS BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEM WIDE OF GOVERNORS I HAVE A YOU INTO THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ENROLLMENT HAS DROPPED BY 20% SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE STUDENTS WHO ARE LEAD UP A HIGH GRADE ARE ARE OLDER STUDENTS AND ARE BLACK AND WHITE. STUDENTS THESE ARE GROUP THAT ALREADY HAVE SOME OF OUR LOWEST SUCCESS RATES AND WHEN THEY LEAVE THE RARELY RETURN. CALVET REPRESENTS AN EDIT INNOVATIVE SHIFT IN INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IN ALREADY WE ARE SEEING STUDENTS GRAVITATE TOWARD TOWARDS THE COLLEGES UNIQUE MODEL. AND EQUALLY CRITICAL IS THAT CALIBRATED FOCUSED ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO SERVE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS ON FIGHT ON FIGURING OUT COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE AS ASSIST NEED HELP RIGHT AND AS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO MERIT TO THE LOGIC THAT DISSOLVING CALIBRATE AND ALLOCATING ITS FUNDS ACROSS THE SYSTEM WOULD SOLVE THE COMPLEX EQUATION FOR SUPPORTING ADULT LEARNERS. WE DIDN'T SERVE ADULT LEARNERS WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND SYSTEM WIDE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS INDICATE THAT WE'RE NOT SERVING THEM WELL NOW EITHER. NOW IS THE TIME FOR CALIBRATE FOR INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR SHARED CHALLENGES NOW IS THE TIME FOR FLEXIBLE PROGRAMS FOR DEEP EXPLORATION OF ONLINE EDUCATION AND SKILLS BASED LEARNING. ALBERT'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN THE COLLEGE'S NEW LEADERSHIP AND STRATEGIC VISION AND WE HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY IMPRESSED BY THE TEAM'S PROGRESS DURING THE SHORT TIME IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. ARE FOR THIS NATION PROVIDED A SEVEN YEAR START UP PERIOD TO BUILD A NEW KIND OF COLLEGE FROM THE GROUND UP AND WE NEED THE IME AND SPACE DO THE IMPORTANT WORK.

YEAH ARE ANY OF THE PERSIAN. ALL RIGHT- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS. OKAY. KAMALA HARRIS. I'LL JUST SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF LEGISLATORS IN THIS BUILDING. BUT IT'S ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. AND THE PROGRAM HAS HAD OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED WITH LESS THAN SEVENTY. OUR STUDENTS ACTUALLY GETTING A CERTIFICATE SO. THAT IS COMPLETELY. THE ANTITHESIS OF WHAT FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IS IN MY OPINION- SO I APPLAUD YOUR WORK BUT WE HAVE TO THINK OF EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT AND DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT- SO I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD OF IT OF- RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS I APPLAUD THE WORK YOU'VE TRIED TO DO- BUT IT. AFTER WE NEED. THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PLAN TO THIS SO IF DESTRUCTOID WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN A HEALTH. AND I THINK AS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE ON EVERY DEDICATED MEMBER OF THE REPRESENTED FACULTY AND STAFF AT OUR INSTITUTION THAT WE ARE ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT WE'RE IN A PERIOD OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AS STUDENTS ARE REACHING OUT TO US AND MORE THAN 90% OF THEM WHEN WE ASK WHY ARE REACHING OUT BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE MODEL THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS THAT ARE. SO RESERVE INSTITUTION OF A PROFOUND IN IN IN IN IN PACKED FULL INTO THEIR LIVES THIS IS OFTEN THEIR ONLY. OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ACCESS AND EDUCATIONAL WORK EXPERIENCE AND AT AT A TIME IN WHICH THE WAY THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING LABOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THE WAY THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THE EDUCATION MARKET IS PROHIBITIVE FOR THEM AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING IT FROM OUR STUDENTS RIGHT WE THIS ISN'T A GAS THIS IS. WE BUT A STUDENTS BY THE NAME OF BRANDY WHO WORKS AS AN ASSISTANT AND DOESN'T SEE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR UPWARD MOBILITY BUT FOR OUR CRM PROGRAM AND THAT THAT HER PURSUIT OF THE CRM PROGRAM IS UNLOCKING WITHIN HER ORGANIZATION AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HER TO GET MORE SUSTAINABLE WAGES AND EITHER READ LIFE AND SHATTERING THE SHINS AT THE TOP WHICH WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT SUCCEEDING IN SERVING THE STUDENTS THEIR FOLLY OUT OF OUR PATIENTS NOT.
