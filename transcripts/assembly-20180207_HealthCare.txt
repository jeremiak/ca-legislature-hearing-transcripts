AYE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL COME UP IN AND MASS OF SO THAT WILL BE. MISTER LIGHTLY. DOCTOR POLLAND. MISTER FOUNTAIN AND DR TWO ZEMSKY OF YOU ALL COME UP HERE THAT IT WAS OUR FIRST PANEL THIS MORNING. AND WE'LL START WITH SOME OPENING REMARKS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE RIGHT IN RIGHT INTO THE PANEL SO I'M. SO GOOD MORNING AND. WELCOME TO THE LAST SCHEDULED HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. FOLLOWING THIS HEARING WILL BEGIN THE WORK OF DEVELOPING OUR REPORT. WHICH WILL INCLUDE ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO RECONVENE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AS WE WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT HOPE TO COMPLETE OUR REPORT BY EARLY SPRING. JUST LAST SEPTEMBER. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS INTRODUCED AS MEDICARE FOR ALL BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND SAID THIS. QUOTE THE TRUTH IS. EMBARRASSINGLY THAT ON THIS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THERE IS NOT BEEN THE KIND OF RESEARCH AND STUDY WEENIE. AND QUOTE. JUST YESTERDAY THE UNITED STATES OF CARE WAS ANNOUNCED. THIS NEW NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT HEADED BY ANY SLAP IT WHO SERVED AS THE ACTING ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. HAS CONVENED A HIGH PROFILE GROUP A PUBLIC HEALTH FIGURES TO RESHAPE HEALTH KICK HEALTH HEALTH CARE. IT'S ONE OF THE MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS BUILDING AND MOBILIZING A MOVEMENT TO ACHIEVE LONG LASTING SOLUTIONS TO ASSURE ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN. HAS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS SOCIAL NEED OR INCOME. AMAZON RATTLED THE HEALTH CARE MARKET A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WHEN IT ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP WITH BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. JP MORGAN CHASE. TO CREATE A NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE COMPASS COMPANY FOCUSING ON COST REDUCTION. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND USER SATISFACTION. ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS HAVE REAP HAVE BEEN REVEALED. IT WILL BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. HERE IN OUR STATE MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR CHANGES ON TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. A VERY PASSIONATE GROUP OF ADVOCATES ALONG WITH CNN CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. HAS RAISE THE AWARENESS AND CERTAINLY THE DECIBELS OF THIS ISSUE ON BEHALF. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO THANK THEM FOR THAT. THE ANSWER SHOULD NOT BE IN POLITICS BUT IN BRINGING TOGETHER EVERYONE WITH ONE GOAL. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MICHAEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO FIND A CONSTRUCTIVE. AFFORDABLE AND LASTING APPROACH. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES I MAKE NO APOLOGIES FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE SPENT ON THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. WE SPENT MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE HOURS USUALLY AFFORDED THE TYPICAL BILL AND A REGULAR REGULAR ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARING. TWENTY EIGHT A HALF HOURS AND COUNTING TODAY. OUR WORK HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVE AND THOROUGH. WE MUST ENSURE THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. YOU MUST BE AFFORDABLE. YOU MUST BE QUALITY. THEY MUST BE SUSTAINABLE. NO MISTAKES NO EMPTY PROMISES. ON MONDAY. WE LEARNED ABOUT THE MANY CHALLENGES WE FACE IN IMPLEMENTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEM. AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE THEY WILL TAKE TIME. AND MORE THAN THAT WE'LL TAKE A CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF POWER IN CONGRESS TO GET THE CHANGES IN FEDERAL LAW THAT WE NEED. TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS OF PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT THEIR PLANS FOR ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE. HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA IN IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. I WANNA THANK ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THEIR ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. AS WE CLOSE IN ON A PATHWAY TO A HEALTH CARE SOLUTION FOR EVERYONE WHO CALLS CALIFORNIA HOME. A AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MY CO CHAIR DOCTOR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA TO MAKE HIS OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO IS HERE TODAY ESPECIALLY THANK THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE ATTENDED OR WHO HAVE WATCHED ALL SIX DAYS OF OUR HEARINGS. I AM PARTICULARLY COGNIZANT OF OUR ADVOCATES AND APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS CAUSE. KNOWING THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR MANY OF YOU TO ATTEND ALL THE HEARINGS IN PERSON DUE TO OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AS A PUBLIC SERVANT IT'S OUR DUTY TO BE A VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS. AND I'M AWARE THAT SO MANY FROM MY COMMUNITY COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. I WILL DO MY BEST TO BE THEIR REPRESENTATIVE. TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON PROPOSALS THAT CAN IMPROVE OUR STATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE WILL HEAR FROM A BROAD RANGE OF INTEREST GROUPS THAT HAVE IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS AND BETTER CARE. THIS COMMITTEE'S CHARGE IS DEFINED WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND INCREASE ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. A BETTER ORGANIZED SYSTEM COVERING EVERY CALIFORNIAN WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY CUT OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS. EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS SPENDS LESS ON THEIR HEALTHCARE THAN WE DO. AND WITH BETTER HEALTH CARE RESULTS. WE HOPE TO FIND A SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS THAT WILL PROVIDE COVERAGE TO ALL. BY EXAMINING THE EFFICIENCIES AND COST CONTROL MECHANISMS. TODAY WE WILL HEAR ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT. WE KNOW THATPEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED. THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE TOO LITTLE MEDICAL CARE AND RECEIVE IT TOO LATE. AS A RESULT THEY ARE SECKER AND DIE SOONER. I AM CONVINCED WE CAN IMPROVE OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. FOR ALL ITS RESIDENTS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING WE WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS PATHWAYS WE CAN PURSUE. TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AS A CO CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I REMAINED COMMITTED TO HELPING PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE THIS. WITH ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HEALTH CARE AND WHAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS ARE PROPOSING AND THREATENING TO DO. CALIFORNIANS ARE RIGHTFULLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN GET AND KEEP AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND WHETHER THEY WILL BE DOCTORS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS TO CARE FOR THEM. THE WORK WE HAVE DONE SO FAR HAS ALLOWED US TOGETHER ALL OF THE FACTS ABOUT HEALTHCARE INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL PROVIDE US THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS. BEFORE I PASS THAT ON TO THEM. I WANTED TO SAY THAT WE WILL HAVE TWO PANELS TODAY. WITH THREE PRISONERS IN EACH PANELAND FOLLOWING EACH PANEL MEMBERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. WE ARE SCHEDULED FOR A BREAK FOR LUNCH FROM TWELVE THIRTY TO ONE THIRTY. THE FOLLOWING THE FINAL PRESENTATION OF PANEL TO WILL PROVIDE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE WE ALLOWS MANY PEOPLE TO SPEAK AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL AND LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTE IF POSS. WHEN YOU HAVE EXCEEDED THE TWO MINUTES WE PLAN TO TURN THE MICROPHONE OFF. ONLY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE TO ALLOW AS MANY PEOPLE TO SPEAK AS POSSIBLE. MORE DETAILED WRITTEN COMMENTS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME AND CAN BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS TO THE OTHER MEMBERS ON OUR COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CO CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE. AND TO EVERYONE THAT IS HERE THIS IS A BIG ISSUE. I WON'T. BELABOR THE POINT IT IS ARM BASICALLY THECOMMITTEE WHERE ROBERT HITS THE ROAD I THINK IN YOU KNOW EVERY QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE HONEST. WELL WE ASKED AND THE. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION. SIMILARLY I LIKETO THINK I DOCTOR WOULD IN A STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AND BRING SO MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER FOR. THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HEARINGS I'D LIKE TO THINK DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE DEDICATION I KNOW THIS IS T. IT'S. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR HOURS UPON HOURS AND THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH HOURS TO REALLY HOW THIS CONVERSATION BUT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I AM I APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT TO WILL BUT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK EVERY PERSON WHO HAS COME OUT FOR EVERY SELECT HEARING A SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING. THOSE AT A PROVIDE THEIR EXPERTISE IN THOSE WHO HAVE JUST SPOKEN AND SHARE THEIR STORIES. AS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINDING A PATH TO COMPLETE COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND THAT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MUST PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES THAN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS PROVIDING. WHEN IT COMES TO WHEN WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT WHICH I BELIEVE WE WILL. IT WILL TAKE MONTHS AND YEARS TO IMPLEMENT AND I PERJURED TESTIMONY. AND I'VE HEARD SO MANY OF YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE ARE SICK AND PEOPLE ARE DYING NOW. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE WHO NEED ARSES SINCE TODAY. AND OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER INSURED WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE FIND BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. I I KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE PASS SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AND IT WAS SIGNED FOR SIGN FOR URGENCY IT. IT WILL STILL TAKE US TIME TO IMPLEMENT. AND SO I'D LIKE TO THINK CNN ALL THE ATTENDEES WHO HAVE SHOWN UP FOR THE HEARINGS MAJOR CALLS WRITTEN YOUR LETTERS KNOCKED ON DOORS. A I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS CONVERSATION TO THE FOREFRONT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY I HAVE BEEN IN UNINSURED PERSON. AND I'VE BEEN A SICK UNINSURED PERSON SO AS I THINK ON THIS COMMITTEE THERE'S PROBABLY NO ONE THAT IS MORE PERSONAL TO. SO I REALLY DO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR DRIVE I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE FOREFRONT. AND ON AND I DO THINK YOU ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND AND THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN AND EDUCATED US ON YOUR TIME AND YOUR EFFORT. HER FIRST PRESENTERS TODAY WILL BE THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION MICHAEL LIGHTY DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR CMA. RIGHT DOCTOR PAUL AND PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT UNIVERSITY OF AMHERST. AND STEPHANIE ROBERSON WITH C. N. AS WELL. WHAT'S THAT. YOU'RE GOOD OKAY SO MY NAME'S MICHAEL LADY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE. OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL FOR GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE. WE ARE NOT PRESENTING AN OPTION FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE COVERAGE IS NOT CARE ACCESS IS NOT HERE. THIS IS ARE PROPOSAL FOR GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM FACING CALIFORNIANS WILL WE BE ABLE TO GET THE HEALTH CARE WE NEED WHEN WE NEED IT OR WILL THERE BE BARRIERS IN OUR WAY. S. B. FIVE SIX TO ELIMINATES THOSE BARRIERS IT IS GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE IT IS NOT COVERAGE. AND THE REASON WE TAKE THE SCIENCE BECAUSE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BECOME AN INDUSTRY WHERE MONEY IS THE METRIC OF GOOD MEDICINE. THE CAREGIVING PROFESSION THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE SEEN ES WERE EDUCATED TO DO HAS BEEN OVERRUN BY THE PROFIT MOTIVE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN HUGE OUT OF POCKET COSTS THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS. FACE AN UNDER INSURANCE EPIDEMIC FIFTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EXPENSE OF OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS THIRTY AYE PERCENT OF US CAN'T AFFORD IT. THE INDIVIDUAL PREMIUM. IS A MAN'S BUT IT'S SUBSIDIZED BY TAXES ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE GOING TO SUBSIDIZE THE FAILED BUSINESS MODEL OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WHAT THEY DO. IS THEY ORGANIZE THE SYSTEM AS AN INDUSTRY THEY RESTRICT ACCESS AND THEY USE THAT TO PROFIT BASED UPON CLAIM DENIALS AND OTHER PRACTICES. WHAT DO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEY CARE ABOUT JUST WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE WILL WE GET THE HEALTH CARE WE NEED IT IS TO MOST INTIMATE EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIVES WERE PUBLIC POLICY MEETS? OUR EVERYDAY REALITY AND YET WE OUR SUBJECT TO THE PRACTICES OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY WE DO NOT CONTROL OUR OWN CARE. THEY DEDUCTIBLES ANOTHER CARSHARING ARE INCREASING CAN PEOPLE GO TO THE DOCTOR THAT THEY NEED TO OR IS THAT DR OUT OF NETWORK WILL THEY HAVE HIGH FEES THESE OF THE PROBLEMS S. B. FIVE SIX TWO ADDRESSES. AND THAT SIMPLY PROVIDING INSURANCE TO EVERYONE WILL NOT ADDRESS WILL NOT SOLVE. LOOK AT THE DEDUCTIBILITY THREE PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THEY HAVE TROUBLE PAYING THEIR DEDUCTIBLE THAT'S NEARLY HALF. AND HERE IS WE GET TO THE CRUX OF IT WITH THE INSURERS DENIAL OF CLAIMS IS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IN TWO THOUSAND. NINE ELEVEN WE DID A STUDY AND THEN BY THE TIME WE COMPLETED THAT STUDY THEY'VE NOW CLOSED OFF ACCESS TO DATA ON CLAIMS DENIALS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS. TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING CLAIMS BACK IN IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE SAW TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF ALL CLAIMS WERE READ REJECTED. THEY'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY NEED THE PROFIT. NOW WE LOOK IT INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW TO GET A SENSE OF CLAIM DIALS NOW. LOOK AT THAT US ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT CARE TONIGHT IS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY BUT ULTIMATELY. MOST OF THAT THAT SIXTY PERCENT RATHER WAS IN FACT OVERTURNED BECAUSE THOSE CARE DENIALS WERE ILLEGITIMATE PAYMENT DENIED AGAIN. MOSTLY OVERTURNED ILLEGITIMATE TO NILES THESE INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MADE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS NET INCOME WHY ARE CALIFORNIAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES PAIN FOR THE PROFITS. OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY WHEN THEY ADD NO VALUE AND DENIES CARE. AND THE PENALTIES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSESSED OR FRACTION OF WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY. ENCOURAGES PROFIT LOOK AT THE PROFIT PAROLEES ANTHEM HUNDRED SEVENTY. FIVE DOLLARS PER IN ROWLEY IN PROFIT IN PROFIT NO THAT IS DOLLARS NOT SPENT ON CARE. THIS IS REALLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG THIS DENIAL MODEL. IN HERE WE HAVE THE BASIC POINT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS NOT GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE AND IF WE CONTINUE TO ENABLE CARE DENIALS AND USE OUR TAX DOLLARS TO SUBSIDIZE. FAIL BUSINESS MODEL OF THE INSURERS WE ARE WASTING MONEY SIMILARLY IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO TO SUBSIDIZE THE PURCHASE A PRIVATE INSURANCE IF THAT IS NOT GOING TO ENABLE FOLKS TO GET THE CARE WE NEED. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS NOT A SOLUTION. IF WE UNDER FUNDING LIMIT THE SCOPE OF SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE ALL THAT FAILS US POLICY AND ETHICALLY. SO WE WANT TO TURN TO. SP FIVE SIX TWO IT'S A MODEL OF SOCIAL INSURANCE WHERE EVERYBODY'S IN NOBODY'S COVERED WE REPLACED THOSE RISING PREMIUMS WITH. WITH PUBLIC FINANCING WE WERE ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS ONLY OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE NO LONGER A BARRIER TO CARE PROVIDING INSURANCE WILL DO THAT. PLEASE CHOICE OF PROVIDER COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS NO COST TO ACCESS CARE NO FINANCIAL BARRIER TO CARE IT'S A PUBLIC SOLUTION ENROLLMENTS AUTOMATIC EVERYBODY AND NOBODY OUT. AND OF COURSE THERE'S A ROLE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PROGRAMS. IF WE LOOK AT. EIGHT. A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ACT SPECIFICALLY. WE SEE THEY GUARANTEES HEALTHCARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS ALL RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE'D THEIR NUMBER REASONS TO DO THAT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A SINGLE STANDARD OF SAFE THERAPEUTIC CARE. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO INITIALLY ADDRESS HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES BECAUSE IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE KIND OF HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN YOU HAVE. THE KIND OF BENEFITS YOU GET WEATHER TO PLATINUM PLAN OR EMPLOYER PLAN DETERMINE THE STANDARD OF CARE YOU RECEIVE IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. THAT NOT ONLY IS THE YOUR BENEFITS BASED ON ABILITYTO PAY BUT THE ACTUAL STANDARD OF CARE YOU RECEIVE THE ONLY WAY TO ELIMINATE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES BASED ON RACE. GENDER AND INCOME THAT EXIST IS TO ESTABLISH A SINGLE STANDARD SAFE THERE APPEAR CARE BY INCLUDING EVERYONE. WE ELIMINATE BUREAUCRATIC WASTE INEFFICIENCY IN MARKETING COSTS. WE GO TO THE DOCTOR AND PROVIDER OF OUR CHOICE THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE NO OTHER REFORM THIS INSURANCE BASS CAN DO THAT. BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS THAT'S HEALTHY MONEY IS THE CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS AT A LOWER RATE IN LIMIT PEOPLE ABILITY TO GO TO ALTERNATIVES AND WHEN YOU DO GO AT A NETWORK IT'S FORTY PERCENT MORE EXPENSIVE. SO WE ELIMINATE ALL THAT AND IN STILL COMPLETE PROVIDER CHOICE WE WANT DOCTORS AND NURSES AND CLINICIANS IN CHARGE WERE HEALTH CARE NOT INSURANCE COMPANY BUREAUCRATS. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO DOES THAT. WE ESTABLISHED PROGRESSIVE PAYROLL IN INCOME PREMIUMS CALLING TAXES CALL THEM FEES DOCTOR PULL THEM WILL DISCUSS THAT AND WE SET UP AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH. AUTHORITY THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TRUST FUND AND THAT TRUST FUND IS WHAT PAYS PROVIDERS. AND WERE ABLE TO POOL ALL THE MONIES WE CAN GET INTO THIS QUESTION OF OF FEDERAL WAIVERS AND SO FORTH. AND THEN WERE ABLE TO PAY PROVIDERS BASED UPON MEDICARE RATES THAT IS A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS AND A SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH MEDICARE. AND THAT INDEPENDENT PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY THEN PAYS THOSE DOCTORS CLINICIANS WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BECAUSE THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. THAT PREVENT. PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL JUDGMENT FROM BEING OVERRIDDEN BY TECHNOLOGY OR STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS. SO IMAGINE I HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND CLINICIANS ARE IN CHARGE. IT SAVES BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY THAT'S GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. FOR LABOR THAT MEANS THAT WORKERS CAN CHANGE JOBS WITHOUT LOSING INSURANCE IT MEANS THAT. WE CAN HAVE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS WITHOUT HAVING A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE OR FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE THAT'S THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLE. IN LARGE EMPLOYER PLANS. THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND YET WERE EXPECTING THEM TO PAY A FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE THERE'S NO WHETHER PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE. ELIMINATES DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS. YOU HAVE MONEY SAVED FROM LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS TO GO TO WAGES WE CAN INCORPORATE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS INTO THIS PROGRAM THAT'S VOLUNTARY. A PROCESS UNDER S. B. FIVE SIX TWO BUT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE STATE'S. I'M FUNDED RETIREE HEALTH LIABILITY THAT EXCEEDS EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WE CAN TAKE THAT OVER WITH FIVE SIX TWO. THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS IS UNSUSTAINABLE THERE IN THE HEALTHCARE BUSINESS WHEN THE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROVIDES NO BENEFIT TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE. SO THEY WOULD. VERY MUCH DESIRE TO GET OUT OF THAT BUSINESS. WE ESTIMATE AS A DOCTOR POLL OF ALL TALK ABOUT THIS A THIRD TO A HALF. A REDUCTION IN COST TO EMPLOYERS. THAT THE EMPLOYER'S PREMIUM PAYMENT COLLEGE ATTACKS COLOR TO FEED WILL FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS RELATIVE TO THE SCALE THE ENTERPRISE NO LONGER DO SMALL BUSINESSES GET* TO SPEND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON INSURANCE PREMIUMS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO AFFORD IT WITHIN THEIR BUSINESS MODEL NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM PAY FOR HEALTH BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THE SCALE OF THEIR ENTERPRISE SO IT'S RELATIVE. TO THE REVENUE OR TO THEIR PAYROLL. IT'S MUCH MORE FAIR AND EQUITABLE IN COURSE REAL HEALTHCARE COST CONTROL MEANS VALUE FOR BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN INNOVATE AND GROW THAT'S WATER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CURRENTLY PREVENTS IS THAT BASICALLY. THAT REALLY STRENGTH OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS UNDERMINED BY HOW WE PAY FOR HEALTH CARE. WE TALK ABOUT GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL EXIST EVERY RESIDENT THE STATE SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE ENTITLED TO ENROLL? SETS A SINGLE STANDARD OF SAFE THERAPY TO CARE FOR ALL RESIDENTS THAT'S THE PRIMARY PROGRAM STANDARD IN THE LAW. THE PROHIBITION ON OVERRIDING CLINICIANS PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IS ENSHRINED IN LAW. IF WEAKER COMMITTED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE HUMAN RIGHT THAT WE CAN'T LET THAT BE CONDITIONED BY INSURANCE COMPANY DENIALS BY ABILITY TO PAY. OR BY LIMITATIONS ON WHAT PROVIDERS CONSIDER MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ESTABLISH HEALTH GUARANTEE IT FOR ALL. AND NOT ESTABLISH THOSE BARRIERS. SO WE ELIMINATE THOSE PREMIUMS. COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION THAT DOCTOR POLL TALK ABOUT OF ALTERNATIVE. FUNDING MECHANISMS. WE TALKED ABOUT GOING TO THE PROVIDER. OF YOUR CHOICE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS BEING. ALSO CARE DELIVERED IN THE MOST CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE SETTING THAT IS NOT THE BASIS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS WILL PROVIDE CARE IN THE LEAST EXPENSIVE CLINICAL SETTING. BUT DOCTORS AND NURSES KNOW THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT MIGHT SAVE THE HOSPITAL CORPORATION MONEY AND WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. SO WILL REQUIRE AS A MATTER OF DUTY FOR PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS PATIENT ADVOCACY SO ANY OF THE FINANCIAL INTEREST THEY MAY HAVE IN A SAY IN OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTER. CANNOT OVERRIDE THEIR DUTY TO. ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEIR PATIENTS. AS THEY SAY IT'S THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE CANNOT OVERRIDE THE EFFECTIVE JUDGMENT OF CLINICIANS. THE LIST OF THE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS THAT INCLUDES REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES YOU'LL NOTICE IT INCLUDES. SOME LONG TERM CARE SERVICES THAT WILL NO LONGER BE MEANS TESTED UNDER S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. THAT IT'S DENTAL AND VISION THIS IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN ANY OF THE PLANS OUT THERE NOW AND AT LOWER COST AS DOCTOR PULL THEM WILL SHOW. THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH CARE A SORTIE AS I SAID THE TRUST FUND IS CREATED AND ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD AND IT WILL BE. MANDATED TO HAVE A A PRUDENT RESERVE YOU ASKED US TO ADDRESS GOVERNMENT'S THIS IS THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR THE BOARD NINE MEMBERS FOR FROM THE GOVERNOR TO FROM THE SENATE. AND ASSEMBLY WITH THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SERVING AS A. X. OFFICIO AND HAVE TO HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXPERTISE IN HEALTH CARE. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS PROCESS IS FOR CREATING A SINGLE PIPE WE TAKE ALL THE REVENUE FROM FEDERAL. EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE SOURCES PUT IT THROUGH A SINGLE PIPE OR CHANNEL AND THEN WERE ABLE TO. PAY PROVIDERS BASED ON ON THAT POOLED RESOURCE. WE ELIMINATE CARE DONE I'LL SEND AND RESTRICTIONS THERE'S A BEEN A QUESTION HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT SERVICE DELIVERY WILL OCCUR. OVERDOING IS FOR STOPPING THOSE DENIALS EMERIL ELIMINATING GATEKEEPING A NARROW NETWORKS AND THE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO CARE. BUT IT'S A MIXED PAYMENT SYSTEM SO SOME PROVIDERS BE PAID ON FEE FOR SERVICE SOME WILL BE PAID ON A PER CAPITA BASIS SOME WILL BE PAID ANA OPERATING BUDGET BASIS. AND WE LEAVING THAT UP TO THE BOARD FOR FLEXIBILITY DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT. BUT WHEN DOING SO WE'RE ABLE TO BECAUSE EVERYONE'S IN ONE SYSTEM HAVE DATA COLLECTED BASED UPON OUTCOMES AND PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES. AND USE THAT DATA SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DENY PEOPLE CARE UP FRONT WE CAN REVIEW. PRACTICES IDENTIFY OUT LIARS IDENTIFY FRAUD AND AFTER THE FACT AND CORRECTED GOING FORWARD WE THINK THAT'S A MORE EFFICIENT WAY. HAVING SAVE MONEY UP FRONT BY PUBLIC FINANCING AND EVERYBODY IN ONE POOL WITHIN ARE ABLE TO REVIEW QUALITY CARE THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC DATA COLLECTION THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE BILL. AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO BARRIER TO ACCESS. WE DO SAID MEDICARE RATES AS PRESUMPTIVELY REASONABLE AND WE NEGOTIATE FROM THERE SO FOR ALL SERVICES THAT MEDICARE COVERS THOSE RATES WILL BE THE SAME. AS. IN CALIFORNIA AS IN MEDICARE. BAND THAT THEY AS I MENTIONED CAN BE ON A DIFFERENT. PAYMENT METHODOLOGY BASIS WE HAVE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS REMEMBER WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN'S SHORTAGE REGARDLESS OF WHAT SYSTEM WE GO TO. THIS SYSTEM IMPROVES THE PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT STABILIZES REIMBURSEMENT ENDS ALL THE HASSLES THAT. DOCTORS EXPERIENCE AND GUARANTEES REASONABLE PAY IN AN EFFICIENT AND TIMELY MANNER SO IT'S A. MUCH IMPROVED SYSTEM THE PATIENT ADVOCACY DUTY I MENTIONED WE PRESERVE A ROLE FIRST HAVE PARTLY TRUST. AS PART OF OUR APPROACH TO CARE COORDINATION WHICH THE COMMITTEE ASKED WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE. ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SYSTEM THROUGH EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. SURFER IN A COUNTY SYSTEM NOW THAT COUNTY SYSTEM CAN BE A CARE COORDINATOR UNDER HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THEY CAN HELP YOU NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM THEY CAN TRACK YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS. SO FACILITATE THE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. AND THE TAP PARTLY TRUSTS ARE ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT CAN DO THAT. WE CONSOLIDATE ALL STATE DRUG PURCHASING WE WILL APPLY FOR WAIVERS WE HAVE A PROCEDURE BOTH TO GET THOSE WAIVERS AND IN THE EVENTUALITY WE DON'T. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR THAT CALIFORNIA'S ENTITLED TO FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE RECEIVE IT'S. ASSEMBLY QUESTION OF HOW WE CHANNEL THAT. WE DO HAVE A TRUST JUST TRANSITION FOR DISPLACED WORKERS AS WELL WHO MAY BE. LOOSE WORKER TRANSITION TO ANOTHER JOB. I'M GONNA LEAVE IT THERE ON TIME WHAT I WANNA. LEAVE IT WITH IS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE REAL HEALTH SECURITY AND GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE. MOST IMPORTANTLY PEACE OF MIND FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT'S WHAT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO PROMISES. PEACE OF MIND THANK YOU. CORRECT. REGISTERED. OKAY. I'M OF ROBERT POLAND AND I'M A. DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND CO DIRECTOR OF THE POLITICAL ECONOMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST NOT UNIVERSITY OF AMHERST. I WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE ON SUCH THINGS NAM. I AM ALSO. FORMER PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. WHERE I LIVED IN RIVERSIDE RAISE MY TWO CHILDREN WITH MY WIFE AND RIVERSIDE AND HAVE? VERY STRONG CONNECTIONS AND FEELINGS CONTINUE TO. WITH RIVERSIDE WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS SUMMARIZE. OUT RIGHT NOW SOME OF THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THE STUDY. I CO AUTHORED. WITH OTHER. UMASS FACULTY MEMBERS. THAT WAS PUT OUT IN MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IN THE INTERESTS OF DISCIPLINE IN TIME I'M BASICALLY GONNA READ. THIS SUMMARY. THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLE. TO CREATE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE STATE THAT ENABLES ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO ENJOY DECENT HEALTHCARE AS A RIGHT. THIS IS CERTAINLY A LAUDABLE GOAL BUT WE STILL NEED TO ASK SOME HARD QUESTIONS IS IT REALISTIC TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DECENT HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE SPECIFICALLY. IS THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL A WORKABLE VEHICLE FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. MY SHORT ANSWERS ARE YES AND YES. PROVIDING UNIVERSAL DECENT HEALTHCARE IS WITHIN REACH AND CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT MATTER IN THE U. S. OVERALL. AND YES HEALTHY CALIFORNIA DOES PROVIDE A VIABLE FRAMEWORK FOR ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. LOTS OF DETAILS WILL NEED TO BE FILLED IN TO MAKE THE PROPOSAL FULLY WORKABLE BUT IN MY VIEW THE BASIC APPROACH IS SOUND. IN THESE REMARKS I'M GOING TO TOUCH ON FOUR KEY ISSUES. COSTS OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TENCHI OFFER COST SAVINGS UNDER HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. HOW TO FUND HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE ON FUNDING HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ON THE STATE'S HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES RELATIVE TO WHAT EVERYONE IS PAYING NOW FOR HEALTHCARE? NOW BEFORE GOING INTO THESE ISSUES I WANTED TO START BY RECOGNIZING. TWO RECENT REPORTS PROVIDED ON THE ISSUE BY STAFF MEMBERS AT BOTH THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS TO RELEASE A REPORT. AND APRIL. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHOSE REPORT JUST CAME OUT TWO DAYS AGO. THESE ARE BOTH USEFUL REPORTS IN MY VIEW. I SPOKE WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE FIRST REPORT LED BY MISTER BRANDON MCCARTHY BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED. I AGREE WITH ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF WHAT'S IN BOTH REPORTS THAT'S NOT TOTALLY SURPRISING THAT I WOULD AGREE IT SO HAPPENS. THAT ONE OF MY BEST STUDENTS FROM UC RIVERSIDE MR ROBERT ENGINEERED ó PARTICIPATED IN PREPARING AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. NOW THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE I HAVE WITH THESE REPORTS AS I WILL ADDRESS BELOW. IS I BELIEVE THERE ARE LARGE AREAS OF POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS THAT ARE ATTAINABLE THROUGH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. I REACHED THIS CONCLUSION NOT ON MY OWN BUT THROUGH ASSESSING THE RELEVANT RESEARCH LITERATURE ON THESE MATTERS INDEED AND WORKING WITH THIS RESEARCH LITERATURE. OVERALL WE SET OUR ESTIMATES OF COST SAVINGS THROUGH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF WHAT THE LITERATURE THINKS IS REASONABLE. OKAY CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM COSTS. FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OVERALL HEALTHCARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT OF THE STATE'S TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GTPASE. HEALTHCARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOWER AS A SHARE OF GDP THAN IN THE U. S. OVER ALL IN WHICH HE SHARES ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF GDP. AT THE SAME TIME HEALTHCARE COSTS AND ALL OTHER ADVANCED INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES RANGE BETWEEN NINE AND ELEVEN PERCENT OF GDP THIS INCLUDES GERMANY FRANCE THE UK JAPAN AND CANADA. OVERALL HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES IN THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALL SUPERIOR TO THOSE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE U. S. GENERALLY. AT PRESENT ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NINETY TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT ARE COVERED BY SOME FORM OF HEALTH INSURANCE. WHY TWO WHILE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION? A SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT ARE UNINSURED ONE OF THE GOALS OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS THEREFORE TO PROVIDE DECENT COVERAGE TO THE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION WHO ARE PRESENTLY UNINSURED THESE FIGURES OF COURSE REFLECT. ANYTHING BEFORE THE REPEAL OF THE HEALTH CARE MANDATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT IN ADDITION TO THE UNINSURED THEIR ROUGHLY ANOTHER THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WHO ARE WHAT WE COULD CALL UNINSURED. THERE'S NO SINGLE PRECISE DEFINITION OF ON DURING OF UNDERINSURED. IN OUR STUDY WE TOOK AN EXPANSIVE DEFINITION WORKING FROM A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE COMMONWEALTH FUND AN OUTSTANDING RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. THIS SURVEY FOUND THAT FOR THE U. S. OVER ALL ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WENT WITHOUT NEEDED CARE BECAUSE OF COST CONSIDERATIONS. THE FIGURE IS MODESTLY LOWER FOR CALIFORNIA THESE PEOPLE ONE DID NOT FILL A PRESCRIPTION TO SKIP TO RECOMMENDED TESTER TREATMENT THREE DID NOT VISIT A DOCTOR EVEN WHILE HAVING A HEALTH PROBLEM OR FOR DID NOT GET NEEDED SPECIALIZED CARE. THIS IS OUR WORKING DEFINITION OF THE UNDER INSURED POPULATION THERE OTHER DEFINITIONS AND WE CAN GO THROUGH THEM AS YOU WISH LATER. OKAY WHAT OF THE COST OF PROVIDING DECENT CARE FOR EVERYONE WITH IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. OKAY WE ESTIMATE THAT TO PROVIDE DECENT CARE FOR EVERYONE UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND NOW I'M GOING TO INCLUDE THE SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT WHO ARE UNINSURED AND THE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT WHO ARE UNDERINSURED. UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE NOW SPENDING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'D REYES COST BY ABOUT TEN PERCENT TO PROVIDE DECENT. CARE FOR EVERYONE THAT IS THE OVERALL SYSTEM COSTS WOULD RISE. TRUE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION FROM THE EXISTING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION JUST TO EMPHASIZE SINCE AGAIN. WE ARE NOT GOING FROM ZERO TO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION WE ARE GOING FROM THREE SEVENTY TO FOUR HUNDRED UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM. NOTE THAT HERE THAT OUR ESTIMATE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT AND THE STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. NOW ATTENTION FOR COST SAVINGS. WORKING AGAIN FROM THE EXISTING LITERATURE AND MAKING CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN THAT LITERATURE. WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT HEALTHY CALIFORNIA COULD GENERATE A TOTAL OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM HERE IS HOW WE GET THERE. WE ESTIMATE SIX POINT SIX PERCENT SAVINGS ON ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM WIDE. THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT SAVINGS ON LOWERING PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS SYSTEM WIDE. THREE PERCENT SAVINGS ON ESTABLISHING MEDICARE RATES FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE BOARD AS MICHAEL JUST REFERRED TO. AND FIVE PERCENT SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCING UNNECESSARY TREATMENTS. SPENDING PREVENTIVE CARE AND CUTTING BACK ON FRAUD AND ABUSE. OKAY THAT'S HOW YOU GET EIGHTEEN PERCENT SAVINGS THUS. THE WHEN WE COVER EVERYBODY WITHIN THE SYSTEM. UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM BEFORE SAVINGS WE GO FROM THREE SEVENTY BILLION TO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION. WHEN WE INCORPORATE THE SAVINGS LITERATE SHIVA BOWL WITH THEM CONSERVATIVELY ACHIEVABLE WITHIN HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS WILL GO DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION OR THEREABOUTS. TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS WILL GO DOWN FROM THE EXISTING THREE SEVENTY BILLION TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION AND UNDER THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION WITH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA EVERYBODY GETS DECENT HEALTHCARE. NOW HOW DO WE FINANCE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION. EXISTING PUBLIC FUNDS RIGHT NOW FEDERAL STATE AND MUNICIPAL FINANCING COVERS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES IN CALIFORNIA. EXISTING FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTINUE PROVIDING THIS CURRENT LEVEL OF SPENDING. IF A STATE ORGANIZES ITS OWN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DIFFERENTLY THAN THE PREVAILING SYSTEM AS LONG AS THE STATE RUN SYSTEM PROVIDES ITS RESIDENTS WITH AT LEAST THE SAME QUALITY OF CARE AS THE PREVAILING SYSTEM. THIS IS THE FEDERAL LAW PASSED ON TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SECTION ONE THREE THREE TWO WHICH PROVIDES WAIVERS IN STATES THAT DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. UNDER THIS LAW EXISTING PUBLIC FUNDING WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION OF THE TOTAL THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION. WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION. IN OUR STUDY WE OFFERED TWO SETS OF PROPOSALS FOR GETTING THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION. IN THE FIRST THE STATE ESTABLISHES A GROSS RECEIPTS FEE OR TAX. TWO POINT THREE PERCENT ON BUSINESSES WITH AN EXEMPTION FOR THE FIRST TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUES FOR ALL BUSINESSES. THREE THIS EXEMPTION ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE SMALLER FIRMS WOULD PAY NOTHING IN GROSS RECEIPTS FEE. AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES WOULD PAY AN ATTACK AFFECTIVE RATE OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT THAT WOULD STILL REYES NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THE STATE COULD ALSO INSTITUTE A SALES FEE OR TAX INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. THIS WOULD EXEMPT HOUSING UTILITIES FOOD PURCHASE FOR HOME AND A RANGE OF SERVICES. AND WE INCLUDE A TAX CREDIT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AT TWO PERCENT THAT WOULD RAISE THE ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN BILLION. OTHER OPTIONS ARE OF COURSE POSSIBLE. AND WE'VE EXPLORED ONE OF THESE IN DETAIL IN OUR STUDY THAT IS TO SUBSTITUTE A PAYROLL FEE OR TAX FOR THE GROSS RECEIPTS MEASURE. THE PAYROLL FEE TO GENERATE THE SAME NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THE TAX RATE WOULD HAVE TO BE SIX POINT SIX PERCENT ON ALL BUSINESSES NOW WHAT IF WE WANTED EXEMPTS SMALL BUSINESSES AGAIN. CAN BE DONE. YOU EXEMPT THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PAYROLL FOR ALL BUSINESSES AGAIN ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD PAY NO PAYROLL TAX OR FEE. TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST REVENUE THE RATE WOULD HAVE TO RISE TO A MAXIMUM OF SEVEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR THE TWENTY PERCENT OF LARGER BUSINESSES. WHAT IF WE LOWERED THE EXEMPTION THRESHOLD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AS OPPOSED TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND? THE AVERAGE SMALL BUSINESS WOULD NOW PAY A FEE OR TAX AT TWO PERCENT WHILE LARGE BUSINESSES WOULD PAY UP TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT. OUR APPROACH IN PROPOSING THESE VARIOUS TAX MEASURES IS BASED ON THE STANDARD GOAL WITH TAXATION POLICY. TO HAVE RATES SET LOW ENOUGH AS TO MINIMIZE DISTORTIONS AND HERE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AN AREA WHERE I AGREE FULLY. WITH THE A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BECAUSE THEY HIGHLIGHT THIS EXACT POINT ON PAGE SEVENTEEN. ECONOMISTS TEND TO PREFER TAXES WITH BROAD BASES AND LOW RATES BECAUSE THEY MINIMIZE ECONOMIC DISTORTIONS THAT IS WHEN INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS MAKE LESS EFFICIENT DECISIONS AND THEY WOULD HAVE MADE WITHOUT THE TAX SO. WE HAVE DELIBERATELY DESIGNED THIS SUCH THAT THE TAX RATES ARE CAPPED RELATIVELY LOW WE GENERATE THE NECESSARY REVENUE AT LOW RATES THAT'S CRITICAL. NOW WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT ON HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. RELATIVE TO THEIR CURRENT HEALTHCARE COSTS MOST CALIFORNIAN FAMILIES WILL END UP SPENDING LESS EVEN WITH THE NEW TAXES AND SOMEONE JOINT LARGE GAINS. WORKING WITH THE GROSS RECEIPTS SALES TAX SCENARIO MOST HEALTHCARE SPENDING FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WOULD FALL BY BETWEEN TWO POINT SIX AND NINE PERCENT OF INCOME. MOST BUSINESSES WOULD ALSO SEE A DROP IN SPENDING. SMALL FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEIR WORKERS WILL SEAT COSTS FALL AS A WINDFALL BY TWENTY TWO PERCENT AS A SHARE OF PAYROLL. FOR MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS COSTS WILL FALL BY AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN SIX POINT EIGHT AND THIRTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT AS A SHARE OF PAYROLL. EVEN MOST LARGE FIRMS WILL SEE COSTS FALL BY AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN ZERO POINT SIX AND FIVE PERCENT. THIS PROPOSAL IS THE US ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE FOR MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES AND MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEHOLDS RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM THEY WILL BENEFIT IN FINANCIAL TERMS. OUR RESULTS ARE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS THAT I WANTED SITE BY PROFESSOR A GYMKHANA AT UC SAN FRANCISCO AND COLLEAGUES. WHO HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR WHAT THEY CALL HEALTHY? HEALTH CARE COST CALCULATOR WE CAN GO THROUGH SOME DETAILS OF THAT BUT AT WHAT THEY DO RISK IS. GET MORE PRECISE BRAKE PADS OF DIFFERENT FAMILY TYPES FACING DIFFERENT KINDS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. OUR OVER ARCHING CONCLUSION IS THAT HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES AND MOST INCOME LEVELS AND BUSINESSES OF MOST SIZES. THIS WILL BE TRUE THROUGH A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE FINANCING APPROACHES INCLUDING USING A PAYROLL ARE GROSS RECEIPTS FEE OR TAX AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING. THESE SAVINGS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE BENEFITS THE FUNDAMENTAL BENEFITS OF THE MEASURE. WHICH IS THAT THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE ACCESSALL RESIDENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO DECENT HEALTHCARE THANK YOU NEXT WILL WE WILL HAVE DALE FOUNTAIN CHAIRPERSON AND CEO OF ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND IF I MAY JUST EXTEND MY APOLOGIES TO DOCTOR POLLAND FOR GETTING THE SCHOOL. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. GLENDALE FOUNTAIN CHAIRPERSON CBO CONNECT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. THINKS OR HAVING ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE ROADBLOCK MOVE LACKED. Y. A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS NEEDED TO ALLOW HEALTHCARE FUNDING. THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS PRESENTATION ISN'T JUST ENTIRE LEGISLATURE BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE LEGISLATURE'S INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH PROP FOR AND PROP NINETY EIGHT IN ALL THE BUDGET CALCULATIONS EACH YEAR. WHILE THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS ALL BUT COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. MY PRESENTATION WILL GO ON OF WILL BUILD ON THE TESTIMONY GIVEN TO THE SAME COMMITTEE ON MONDAY FEBRUARY FIFTH. SO PLEASE GO AHEAD AND POSITS SPEED YOU IF YOU'RE WATCHING HOME WATCH THAT WHEN WE COME BACK. SO A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA SPONSORING ABOUT PROPOSITION FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE ROADBLOCK MOVE LACKED OR SHARE A SELECTIVE COLLEGE. IT WILL NOT BY ITSELF IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. BUT IT WILL ENABLE. ANY FUTURE HEALTH CARE LEGISLATIONIN THE STATE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE BALLOT EACH TIME. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR CONSTITUTION WOULD APPLY NOT ONLY TO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE WHERE INCREMENTAL WHICH LEGISLATION. BUT TO ANY COST CONTROLS SUCH AS GLOBAL BUDGETING OR STATEWIDE BUYING COOL FOR FORMA. TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA IS FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. AND IF THE STATE SIMPLY HELD THAT AND PAID IT BACK OUT. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE SENT TO EDUCATION VIA PROP NINETY EIGHT. PROP FOR WOULD REBATE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE OTHER HALF BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS. HEALTH CARE WOULD BE LEFT WITH ALMOST NOTHING. SHARE IT COSTS NOTHING ITSELF IN SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN THAT WAY. EVEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOUND IT WILL HAVE NO DIRECT FISCAL IMPACT. IF PASSED THE LEGISLATURE CAN THEN PASS AN ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WORKING DO INCREMENTALLY. HAVING TO GO TO THE BALLOT WILL NO LONGER BE AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION. SHARE EXEMPTS HEALTH CARE FUNDING FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT THE MINIMUM FUNDING GUARANTEE FOR EDUCATION. AND PROP FOR STATE SPENDING CAPS AKB CAN LIMIT. BUT OTHERWISE LEAVES THESE RESTRICTIONS INTACT. ALRIGHT SO LET'S GET INTO A LITTLE HISTORY. THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT IS HOWARD JARVIS AND GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT IS PAUL CAN. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS WE'RE SEEING THEIR PROPERTY VALUE SEWER. RIGHT ALONG WITH THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. SO WE'RE GETTING TAXED OUT OF THEIR OWN HOMES CALIFORNIANS WERE BAKING A LEGISLATURE FOR RELIEF. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THERE WERE A FEW PROPOSALS BOUNCED AROUND THE LEGISLATURE BUT NOTHING PASSED. HOWARD JARVIS AND PAUL GANN CAME UP WITH THEIR OWN PLAN AND GOT ON THE BALLOT AS PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. IT'S A LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HAD SIMPLY PASSED ANYTHING TO LOWER PROPERTY TAXES. PROP THIRTEEN WOULD NOT OF GOT MOMENTUM. ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT THE PROPERTY TAXES FOR INCREASING THAT YEAR SOME BY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OR MORE. PROP THIRTEEN PASSED IN A LANDSLIDE. I INITIALLY GOVERNOR BROWN WAS SUPPOSED TO PROP THIRTEEN. THEN IT PASSED. AT THAT POINT HE BECAME IN HIS OWN WORDS A BORN AGAIN TAX CUTTER. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE GOVERNOR BROWN TEAMED UP WITH JARVIS AND CAN TO PUT A SPENDING CAP ON THE BALLOT. WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS PROPOSITION FOR. KK THE GAMUT. THE FALLOUT FROM PROP THIRTEEN WAS IMMEDIATE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE WHICH A STATE DEPLETED ITS OWN RESERVE TO BACK FILL. BUT WITH THE STATE TAKING GUT PUNCH WITH PROP FOR. TAXES COULD NOT BE RAISED WITH OTHER METHODS. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES MANY SCHOOLS CLOSED CONSOLIDATED AND CUT PROGRAMS. INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUCH IS FREEWAYS WERE PUT ON HOLD OR CANCELLED ENTIRELY. FACT IF A DISTRICT I GREW UP IN. CITY OF GLENDALE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREE VERSIONS DISTRICT SHE SHOULD REMEMBER THIS CARD JUNIOR HIGH CLOSED AND TWO FREEWAY PROJECT. EYES LEFT UNFINISHED TO THIS VERY DAY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DUE TO PROP FOR. AND DESPITE THE ONGOING FUNDING CRISIS HE ONE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS WAS REBATED TO THE TAXPAYERS. HE DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE CTA PER PROP NINETY EIGHT TO EDUCATION FUNDING GUARANTEE ONTO THE BALLOT. THE POINT BEING HOW THE LEGISLATURE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CRYING OUT FOR RELIEF. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAPPEN. ALRIGHT. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW IT THE GAMMA. HERE'S A SIMPLE DIAGRAM PLEASE DON'T STARE AT IT TOO LONG. ACCORDING TO THE LA ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM AS OF LAST MONTH. HERE'S ONE OF THE FIGURES FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT HAND OUT THAT LA O. GIVES TO NEW LEGISLATORS. MINIMUM FINDINGS BASED ON A FORMULA THAT CAN GO NO LONGER NO LOWER THAN THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THE BUDGET. RIGHT NOW WE'RE AROUND FIFTY PERCENT CURRENT CASE IN FOURTEEN FUNDING TOTAL SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR PROP FOR AN PROP NINETY EIGHT TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY THE VOTERS FOR EXEMPTIONS. WE HAD TO ON THE BALLOT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT PASSED. AND IF YOU NOTICE THERE SO PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPERLY EVAN WAS THESE. WAS A TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WHICH IS ACTUALLY A. IN DISGUISE. IT WAS ACTUALLY A MODIFICATION TO THE CAMERA AND PROP NINETY EIGHT. A PROP TENDS NOT A CHILDREN'S FIRST FIVE. OF PROP ONE A IS THE LOCAL TAXES GO TO LOCAL. AUTHORITIES. PROP FIFTY TWO IS A WHICH WAS JUST. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT PASSED BY SEVENTY PERCENT NET WAS THE HOSPITAL TAX. ARE AND THAT WAS ANOTHER EXEMPTION OF PROP FIFTY SIX. I IS A I. IS ANOTHER TOBACCO TAX. ALRIGHT NOW TALKER COUNTER ARGUMENTS TO THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED. OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO DENY PROP FOR IMPROPER NINETY EIGHT EXIST. HERE THE POPULAR ARGUMENTS. ARE. WE CAN JUST IGNORE AGAIN IN PROP NINETY EIGHT AND. WELL I COULD LOOK AT THE LAWSUIT BY HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS FOUNDATION AND THE CTA. I GOVERNOR BROWN HIMSELF LAST YEAR OF AYE HE TRIED TO SAY HEY WE CAN JUST DO SOMETHING WITH NO WHERE MONEY. AND KEEP BACK DOWN WHEN HOWARD JARVIS. WAS GONNA SUE AND FACT IT'S KIND OF WEIRD WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT AND YOUR ARE GOING TO IGNORE IT. SO THE NEXT ONE IS JUST PUT GANON PROP NINETY EIGHT EXCLUSIONS INTO A LEGISLATIVE BILL. IT IS WEIRD TO HEAR PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING CIVICS. I IT NEEDS TO EITHER TO BE A BALLOT PROPOSITIONS ARE WITH THAT PETITIONS. SIGNATURES COLLECTED AND THEN GO ON THE BALLOT. OR A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN GO ON THE BALLOT EACH TIME I HAVE TO. GO TO THE PEOPLE. ARE THE NEXT RISE A LITTLE BIT ARE. TOO LITTLE BIT IN THERE LOOK T MORE WANT KEY IT'S PREMIUMS ARE LIKE SNICKERS BARS. OR THE USER FEES OUR USER FEES MUST BUY TO CANCEL SERVICE SUCH AS BRIDGE TOWER VEHICLE LICENSE FEE. DRIVER'S LICENSE. I ETCETERA. YET. EIGHT AND INSURANCE PREMIUM IS NOT A USER FEE. IN FACT. YOU CAN YOU CAN PAY INTO INSURANCE ALL YOU WANT AND NEVER GET ANYTHING BACK FROM IT. OF HOW HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK I EVEN RAN THIS BY JUDGE FRIEND OF MINE HE JUST LAUGHED AT IT HE SAID YOU. SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD ACTUALLY BRING THAT UP TO HIM. SO TO FURTHER DISTINCTION PART OF IT IS INTENT OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. ARTICLE THIRTEEN GAVE WHICH IS THE CAMERA IN SECTIONS EIGHT A. I EXPLICITLY. EXPLICITLY. EXEMPTS DISABILITY PREMIUMS. AND THAT'S ANOTHER HEALTH INSURANCE THERE. OKAY. SO THIS IS A WALL OF TEXT I I APOLOGIZE. SADDAM. THIS IS. THIS IS FROM. BAN ADS EVER SERVED. WHO WROTE AN ARTICLE ON THIS JUST THIS LAST MONTH? I HOW THE CANON INTERACTS WITH CAP AND TRADE. I IT WAS FEATURED IN SCOPE OF BLOG. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE A IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE GAMUT. I AND. THE ONLY REASON IT'S NOT OR THE SHORT ANSWER. THAT ALL THIS LEADS TO IS THAT CABIN TRADE IS AN AUCTION. IT'S NOT MANDATORY THAT YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE AUCTION. AND IS THEREFORE NOT ATTACKS. A FURY GOING TO CLAIM SOMETHING LIKE WELL THEY'RE SELL THE STATE IS SELLING SOMETHING. THAT IS ALSO EXCLUDED. LIKE A STATE ASSET IS ALSO EXCLUDED IN. IN CALCULATIONS FOR THE CAMERA I'VE WOULDN'T CONSIDER INSURANCE AS. STATE ACID AND I DOUBT ANYONE HERE WANTS TO RUN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS AN OPTION. OKAY. DOCTOR GRAVES. HE WAS HERE MONDAY THAT'S WHY ASK PEOPLE TO TUNE INTO THAT. I HE ALSO WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER LAST YEAR IN JULY. AND THIS IS BASICALLY HIS CONCLUSION IN SHORT RATHER THAN TRYING TO DEVISE A CLEVER AND LIKELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WAY TO AVOID GOING TO THE BALLOT. SINGLE PAYER ADVOCATES WOULD BE WELL ADVISED AS CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO REMOVE THE KEY CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. I HOPE HE GOES INTO A LOT MORE DETAILS. BEGAN WHEN IT CAN'T BE GOTTEN AROUND. THERE ARE. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE. PROP NINETY EIGHT I HAD BEEN IGNORED BUT IS FORSMALL INCREASES LIKE SMALL INCREASES TO A LOCAL. STE. A LOCAL SALES TAX. BUT NOTHING IS HUGE AS SAY HUNDRED FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN TAXES THAT WE WE NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO SAVE FOR S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT ON TOP OF ANYTHING SAYS JUST A SHIFT IN REVENUES THAT'S STILL. SOMETHING THAT THE STATE SAYS IS. MA PROCEEDS OF TAXES. I'M SO WEAK WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I SAW THAT UP PRETTY MUCH ENDS MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT A PET DOCTOR DOZENS CAN YOU. TO PRESENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE. NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR TURDS IN SKI FROM THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE. THANK YOU UM. I BEEN ACCUSED OF MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE BUT NEVER SELF PROMOTION BUT I'M GOING TO PROMOTE MYSELF RIGHT NOW I MEASURE THE PRESIDENT. I'M NOT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SAYS ON YOUR AGENDA. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR INVITING CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OR CAPITA TO PRESENT TESTIMONY. AND TO ASSIST THE COMMITTEE IN ITS WORK. MY NAME IS STEVEN TARZAN SKIN AYE AYE AND THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE. THE LEAD ARTICLE. IN THE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH ISSUE OF THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE. WHICH ADDRESSED PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. STATED THAT OUR FOR ETHICAL PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PHYSICIANS IN THEIR WORK. A COMMITMENT TO OUR PATIENTS TO BENEFITING OUR PATIENTS. AVOIDING HARM TO THEM. RESPECTING PATIENT AUTONOMY AND STRIVING FOR HEALTH CARE JUSTICE. JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE. THE ARTICLE NOTED IT IS THESE VALUES THAT AFFIRM THE MORAL FOUNDATION AND DEEP MEANING UNDERLYING PHYSICIANS IT IS THE FOURTH VALUE STRIVING FOR JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE THAT I WILL FOCUS MY REMARKS TODAY. LET ME BEGIN BY TELLING YOU WHO WE ARE CALIFORNIA POSITIONS ALLIANCE CAP WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ADVANCING HEALTH CARE REFORM. WITH THE GOAL OF ESTABLISHING A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WE SAW SINGLE PAYER AS THE BEST OPTION BECAUSE IT OFFERED SECURITY CHOICE AND SIMPLICITY AS A PUBLICLY FINANCED NONPROFIT INSURANCE. AND MAINTAINED ARE MAINLY PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN OUR CURRENT ERA IT ALSO OFFERS COST CONTAINMENT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. KAPPA WORKS TO DEVELOP A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BOTH IN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION THAT EMBODIES. CAPAS FIVE CORE VALUES SLIDE PLEASE. NO I HAVEN'T SORRY. I MEAN TO SOMEONE ELSE DOING IT FOR ME. YEAH VERSUS. EXACTLY. AND THANK YOU. GOOD I GOOD ONE OKAY ARE YEAH. THESE VALUES THE THE FIVE CORE VALUES GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL. COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE. THESE VALUES ARE BASED ON OUR BELIEF THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. OUR MISSION IS TO EDUCATE AN ADVOCATE FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS GROUNDED IN CAPAS FIVE CORE VALUES. WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS MOSTLY PHYSICIANS BUT ALSO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PUBLIC HEALTH SCHOLARS. POLICY EXPERTS ANOTHER CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE ALSO HAVE A STUDENT FEEL YET THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PROFESSIONAL STUDENT ALLIANCE CAPS ON. WHICH A SEVERAL THOUSAND MEMBERS AND MANY YOUNG ACTIVISTS. I MEMBERS AND BOARD. AND OUR BOARD CONTINUE TO DEVOTE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEER HOURS TO THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION AND OUR STAFF HOPES GUIDED COORDINATE THIS WORK. WE ALSO KNOWLEDGE THE VITAL SUPPORT OF THE WELLNESS FOUNDATION THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. CAP HAS A THREE PRONGED APPROACH. WE WORK TO HELP PEOPLE GET COVERAGE NOW. WE WORK ON MEDIUM TERM HEALTH REFORMS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES AND WE WORK TO ADVANCE TO A SYSTEM THAT WILL EMBODY THOSE FIVE VALUES. ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR WORK TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE NOW IS OUR STUDENT PROGRAM CALLED PROJECT WHITE COAT. WHICH TODAY HAS AND ROLL OVER FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA AND MEDICARE. OVER THE YEARS CAP HAS WORKED IN A VARIETY OF INCREMENTAL STATE LEGISLATION TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND BENEFITS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF CALIFORNIANS. SOME OF THE LEGISLATION CAP AS A INCLUDED S. B. EIGHT TEN THE SINGLE PAYER BILL AUTHORED BY THEN STATE SENATOR SHEILA CURE ALL. THAT PASSED A STATE LEGISLATOR* LEGISLATURE TWICE IT WAS VETOED TWICE BY THEN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR IN NETWORK COSTS. PREVENTING UNANTICIPATED BILLS FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND SERVICES THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE OVER WHICH THEY DID NOT HAVE CONTROL. AND THE ONE THAT CAP IS MOST PROUD OF SINCE WE WORKED HARD WITH OTHERS TO GET THIS PASSED S. B. SEVENTY FIVE HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS. EXPANDED MEDICAL COVERAGE TO ALL CHILDREN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. KAPPA CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THE PASSAGE OF A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS CURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THAT WOULD FURTHER EXPAND COVERAGE AND PROTECT PATIENTS. KAPPA SUPPORTS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WHICH WASN'T IMPORTANT HISTORIC STEP FORWARD AND STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. I STATED CAP A PLEA AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INCLUDING STATE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM. WE ALSO WORK TO SUCCESSFULLY PASS STATE LEGISLATION FOR FEDERAL WAIVER THAT WOULD PERMITTED UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE IT COVERED HAVE CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE VIRULENT ANTI IMMIGRATION POSITION OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON. STATE WITHDREW ITS REQUEST FOR A WAIVER. AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAIVER REQUEST WAS A VERY SMALL STEP. IT DID ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THIS AND OF IN OF ITSELF WAS AN IMPORTANT POLICY MILESTONE. AS FOR MY PERSONAL HISTORY VERY BRIEFLY I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED GENERAL PEDIATRICIAN A FELLOW OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. I GRADUATED FROM MUCH MEDICAL COLLEGE AND DID MY INTERNSHIP AND RESIDENCY IN PEDIATRICS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY USC MEDICAL CENTER. ON JANUARY FIRST. I RETIRED AFTER FORTY YEARS OF FULL TIME PRACTICE. WHICH HAS ALSO INCLUDED INTERNATIONAL WORK TEACHING AND MEDICAL GROUP LEADERSHIP. THE LAST THIRTY THREE YEARS SPENT AS A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN AND PARTNER IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUP PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE KAISER PERMANENTE MEDICAL CARE PROGRAM. I WILL CONTINUE WORKING PART TIME AS A PER DIEM POSITION IN THAT ORGANIZATION. I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MY REMARKS HERE TODAY ARE MY OWN AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND CAPITA PRESIDENT DO NOT REPRESENT THE POSITION OF KAISER PERMANENTE A. I. YET. YEAH. I'M TALKING TO THEM. FOR THE PAST FORTY FIVE YEARS THAT IS ALMOST MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE I'VE BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ADVOCACY POLICY DEVELOPMENT CRASS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP TO ADVANCE HEALTHCARE REFORM. AND TO ACHIEVE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY. WHY HAS THE UNITED STATES LAGGED OTHER WEALTHY NATIONS AND FAILED TO ACHIEVE TRUE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE? IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN FOR LACK OF TRYING. RATHER THE REASON LIES IN THE STRUGGLE OVER THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN MEDICAL CARE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE VERY FOUNDING OF OUR REPUBLIC. THE EFFORT TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT ROLE IN MEDICAL CARE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONTENTIOUS AND FRAUGHT. FROM SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS SIGNED AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF SICK AND DISABLED SEAMEN. TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SAW GREAT ADVANCES IN PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH THE FAILURE TO PASS TO SHEPARD TOWNER ACT. TO THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO PASS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. INTO THE RECENT EFFORT TO PASS AND NOW PROTECT THE ACA. SOME PEOPLE HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED THE IDEA THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE ITS POWER TO IMPROVE CITIZENS PHYSICAL WELL BEING. THIS OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT REGULATED MEDICAL CARE IS PARTIALLY BASED ON THE VIEW THAT GOVERNMENT GOVERNS BEST WHICH GOVERNS LEAST. LIBERTY MEANS AN UNCONTROLLED FREE MARKET AND THE INDIVIDUAL PURSUIT OF SELF INTEREST. HUMAN EXISTENCE ITSELF IS VIEWED AS A ZERO SUM GAME WHERE THERE CAN ONLY BE WINNERS AND LOSERS. TODAY WE HEAR COSTA BRING BACK POLICY FROM SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND'S ELIZABETHAN POOR LAWS. WHEN THERE'S TALK ABOUT LOW INCOME ABLE BODIED ADULTS NEEDED TO WORK TO DESERVE HEALTH INSURANCE. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS REPEAT BUT UP REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO GOT ALL MEDICAID FUNDING TO THE STATES. GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO PLACE A WORK REQUIREMENT BEFORE SO CALLED ABLE BODIED ADULTS CAN DESERVE HEALTH INSURANCE. SEVERAL STATES ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING AND MOVING TOWARD SUCH MEASURES. NO OTHER CIVILIZED NATION MAKE SUCH A DEMAND ON ITS PEOPLE. FROM MY DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AS A DOCTOR. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO MARKET DRIVEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY LIMIT COSTS. GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND DELIVER DESIRED OUTCOMES. OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE BEST WAYS TO REDUCE COSTS AND GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE IS TO HAVE THE LARGEST RISK POOL THAT IS THE ENTIRE NATION. THESE FACTS COMPEL THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO MOVE TO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM GUIDED BY COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES EXPERIENCES AND BY OUR OWN AMERICAN SUCCESS AS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. HOWEVER GIVEN THE CURRENT CONTOURS OF THE POLITICAL TERRAIN IN WASHINGTON. THE CURRENT CONGRESSIONAL LINE THE FORCES AND THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S RATHER UNLIKELY FOR THE MOMENT THE WE CAN MAKE THE ENTIRE NATION THE RISK POOL. WE NEED IT ME INSTEAD ME TO LOOK TO THE LARGE THE NEXT LARGEST RISK POOL WHICH WOULD BE A VERY LARGE STATE. WITH ELECTED LEADERSHIP THAT HAS COMMITTED ITSELF TO NOT BEING AFRAID OF USING GOVERNMENT. DO NOT BE AFRAID USING GOVERNMENT TO ADVANCE THE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THE STATE THAT HAS AN ECONOMY THE SIZE OF FRANCE THAT HAVE A POPULATION LARGER THAN CANADA. AND IS THE WORLD'S SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY BEST STATE AS WE ALL KNOW IS OUR STATE CALIFORNIA. CAPA ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN ATTENDANCE HERE TODAY BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST TAKE THE LEAD. THIS BELIEF IS GROUNDED IN THE HISTORY OF THE GOLDEN STATE AS A LEADER AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ARTS AND CULTURE. BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE EDUCATION AND OTHER INNOVATION. WITH RESPECT TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS A TERM THAT IS USED BY EVERYONE. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS LIKE MOM AND APPLE PIE WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE AGAINST IT. BUT THIS TERM IS ALSO USED BY INTEREST WITH VARYING MOTIVES. SOME BEHAVE AS ENTRENCHED INTEREST TO PROFIT FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER INCREASE THEIR MARGINS. AND THEIR VERSION OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BUT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS NOT ENOUGH. CAP IS GOAL IS INDEED COVERING EVERYONE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS AFFORDABLE. NOT WASTEFUL OF HIGH QUALITY AND SOCIALLY JUST AND EQUITABLE. NO ONE SHOULD GO BANKRUPT BECAUSE OF MEDICAL BILLS OR GO WITHOUT NEEDED CARE BECAUSE IT IT IS ON AFFORDABLE. EVERYBODY AND NOBODY OUT THAT IS A CALIFORNIA VALUE. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKEN BOLD STEPS TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE USING THE OPENING CREATED BY THE ACA TO BRING AS MANY INDIVIDUALS INTO OUR SYSTEMS POP. OUR STATE LEADERS AND MANY OTHERS HAVE WORK TO MAKE COVERED CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACES AS EFFECTIVE AND INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE EVEN DEFINE THE CURRENT NATIONAL MINISTRATION IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO GUT THE ANNUAL ENROLLMENT PROCESS. MEDICAID OR MEDICARE EXPANSION A CALIFORNIA HAS ACHIEVED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS INCLUDING AS I KNOW TO THE BOB THE IMPORTANT STEP OF PROTECTING ALL UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. YET DESPITE ALL THIS OUTSTANDING A STORK WORK THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE FRAME BY CAPS FIVE CORE VALUES CONTINUES TO ELUDE US OFF. IT IS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL NOW THAT I WISH TO RETURN MY REMARKS. CAPITA PERSPECTIVE IS THAT AS LONG AS COVERAGE IS TIED TO EMPLOYMENT. INHERENTLY WASTEFUL FOR PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE IN THE SYSTEM. AND PRICES ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED WE WILL NEVER ACHIEVE HEALTH CARE REFORM GROUNDED ON OUR FIVE CORE VALUES. CAPITA FRO APPROACH IS ALSO FRAMED BY THE REALITY OF WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN AND CANNOT DO IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. AND THAT CERTAINLY BEGS THE QUESTION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF SOME TYPE OF SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. ANY STATE LEVEL APPROACH TO SOME TYPE OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM REQUIRES CAPTURE A FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THIS CAPTURE RETURN REQUIRES NEW FEDERAL WAIVER LEGISLATION. YET IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL REALITY UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT EXPECT THESE WAIVERS FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS. AND THAT IS HAVE WE ARE VERY LUCKY. WORKABLE MAJORITIES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BE TO APPROVE AND A PRESIDENT WILLING TO SIGN SUCH WAIVERS MUST EXIST. SO THAT GIVES CALIFORNIA AT MINIMUM A THREE YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH TO PREPARE TO TRANSITION TO SOME TYPE OF SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. KAPPA BELIEVES THAT ONE WAY FORWARD MAYBE A STEP BY STEP PROCESS DID BILLS THE BROADEST CONSENSUS POSSIBLE AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT ALSO SURE THAT WE WILL NOT GET STUCK IN A TRANSITION PHASE AND FAILED TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL. CAPITA REALIZES THAT IT ALONE CANNOT DEVELOP DETAILED POLICY PROPOSAL THE CAN BE TRANSLATED TO LEGISLATION THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SUCH A TRIP MAJOR TRANSITION. YET WE CAN DO IS BRING TOGETHER THE EXPERTISE OF WILL DEVELOP THAT POLICY PROPOSAL. SO CAP HAS LAUNCHED. WHAT WE CALL A ROADMAP TO SINGLE PAYER IN CALIFORNIA? THE ROADMAP PROCESS THROUGH A SERIES OF STATEWIDE MEETINGS AND WORKING GROUP'S HAS BEEN BRINGING TOGETHER OVER ONE HUNDRED EXPERTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES INCLUDING PRACTICING PHYSICIANS. NURSES OTHER ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HEALTH POLICY EXPERTS HEALTH ECONOMISTS PUBLIC HEALTH SPA SCHOLARS EXPERTS IN TECH. EXPERTS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT LEGISLATORS ORGANIZED LABOR. LEADING AND A LEADING HEALTH CARE REFORM ACTIVISTS AND OTHERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A REALISTIC PATHWAY TO SINGLE PAYER. THE GOAL OF CAMPUS ROADMAP MEETINGS IS TO DEVELOP A DOCUMENT BUT LAKES BY LATE SPRING THIS YEAR DOUBLE SERVICE A TEMPLATE FOR LEGISLATION. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN OUR STATE BASED ON OUR FIVE CORE VALUES. TWO VERY SUCCESSFUL STATEWIDE MEETINGS HAVE SO FAR BEEN HELD IN LOS ANGELES IN SACRAMENTO. AND. DOCTOR WOULD WAS AT THE SECOND ONE. THE ROADMAP PROCESS CONTINUES. THE SAME TIME CAPITA REALIZES THAT A CRAFTING LEGISLATION FOR A BETTER STATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IT IS ESSENTIAL AND THAT COMMITTEE AND SKI PARTLY AT THE SAME TIME CAPITA REALIZES THAT CRAFTING LEGISLATION FOR BETTER STATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND IS ESSENTIAL IN THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS INVITED CAP HERE TO ADDRESS THIS. WE ARE AWARE FROM MEETINGS WITH SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE ARE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO LACK OF COVERAGE IN SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS AND THAT OF THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WE SHARE THAT AS WELL. I'M NOT ROADMAP PROCESS IS ONGOING AND IT HAS SO FAR IDENTIFIED A FEW BROAD POLICY AREAS THAT WILL BE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A MAJOR TRANSITION AND THESE AREAS ARE LISTED ON THE NEXT SLIDE. YEAH SORRY. SHAME ON ME OKAY. ALRIGHT. WE CAN CERTAINLY THAT THE SOME OF THE AREAS ARE YOU TO YOUR SAVINGS AND REVENUE AFFORDABILITY DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM WORKFORCE. COVERAGE INSURE THE UNINSURED AND BENEFIT PACKAGE PRICE CONTROL GOVERNANCE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MEDI CAL IMPROVEMENT PUBLIC AUCTION AND THERE WILL BE OTHERS. IT'S REALLY GOING TO LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE QUESTIONS. CAP ENVISIONS CALLING OUR IMPROVE NEW STATE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GOLDEN STATE CARE. MY CREDIT FORMER DIRECT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTH. SERVICES DOCTOR MITCHELL CAPS FOR ADJUSTING THE NAME. GOLDEN STATE CARE WILL BE ROLLED OUT IN TWO PHASES. PHASE ONE WOULD OCCUR OVER THE THREE TO FOUR YEARS WHILE WE ALSO WORK HARD TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FROM FEDERAL WAIVERS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATEWIDE ALL PAYER SYSTEM. ALL PAYER SYSTEM. THIS THAT IS FEASIBLE AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHOUT FEDERAL WAIVERS FOR PERMISSION. THE COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED TESTIMONY ON COUNTRIES WITH ALL PAYER SYSTEMS IN OUR WEB AND IN OTHER WEALTHY NATIONS AS WELL AS FOR STATES HAVE TRIED TO DO THIS. FACE TO WITHIN MOVE TO SOME TYPE OF SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WANTS TO REQUIRE CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WOULD OCCUR. AS THE COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF SO CALLED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. CALIFORNIA NATION CAN LEARN FROM THESE EXAMPLES BUT ULTIMATELY. WE MUST DEVELOP OUR OWN SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT FACING IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND FINANCING DELIVERY OF CARE WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS AND DISLOCATIONS AND BLOWBACK. THAT COULD OTHERWISE OCCUR FROM TO SUDDEN OVERNIGHT CHANGE. THE TIME FOR COULD HELP MINIMIZE THE RISK AVERSION OR FEAR OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SATISFIED WITH THEIR CURRENT COVERAGE WILL BE AFRAID TO LOSE IT IN AN OVERNIGHT PROCESS. OPPONENTS OF SINGLE PAYER WILL CERTAINLY EXPLOIT THIS FEAR. MOREOVER PUBLIC FINANCING WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN THIS PROCESS AND CALIFORNIANS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE UNUSUALLY GENEROUS AND TAXING THEMSELVES YET THERE'S IS STILL A QUESTION OF HOW FAR. TAXPAYERS ARE WILLING TO GO. BASICALLY REFORMER STILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF THE PUBLIC'S NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF TAXES AND GOVERNMENT. THE ROADMAP PROCESS IS ALREADY ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE. IT IS KEY TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY NEW TAXES WOULD ACTUALLY SUBSTITUTE FOR THE COST OF KERN INSURANCE BEINGS THEY WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THOSE PREMIUMS AND THAT'S A BETTER DEAL FOR THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. BEFORE LEAVING THE ISSUE FINANCING AFFORDABILITY I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ONE IMPORTANT POINT FOR THE WORKING CLINICIAN'S POINT OF VIEW. WE KNOW THAT PAYING DOCTORS IS ABOUT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF ALL HEALTH COSTS. IT PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT WERE CUT BY TWENTY PERCENT WOULD RESULT IN LESS IN A FIVE PERCENT DECREASE IN OVERALL HEALTH COSTS. BUT WOULD VERY DEEPLY IMPACT PROFESSION ALREADY SADDLED WITH TWICE THE BURNOUT RATE. NOW REACHING FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. ANOTHER PROFESSIONS AND A HIGHER RATE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE. AND ATTEMPT TO CUT COSTS IN THIS MANNER WOULD MAKE TO PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM EVEN FURTHER DEMORALIZED THAN THEY ALREADY ARE WHILE DEALING EVERY DAY WITH TIME WASTING PAPERWORK AND DOCUMENTATION. TO TAKE AWAY FROM CARING FOR PATIENTS WHICH IS ALL THE REALLY SIGNED UP FOR. CONVERSELY INCREASING PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT MEDICARE OUT BY TWENTY PERCENT OR EVEN JUST A MEDICARE RATES. MIGHT ONLY INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS BY LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT BUT VASTLY OPEN ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY CARE AND RESULT IN INDIVIDUAL DECREASES IN OVERALL HEALTH COSTS ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SIMILAR BURNOUT RATES EXISTS WITHIN THE NURSING PROFESSION. THAT'S NOT CONTINUE TO TRY THE PROP SOLVE THE PROBLEM AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ON THE BACKS OF OUR PHYSICIANS AND OUR NURSES THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FAR TOO LONG. I WOULD REFLECT THE COMMON A BIT FURTHER ABOUT THE CURRENT SINGLE PAYER BILL S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. LET ME FIRSTLY VERY CLEAR THE CAP IS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE GOAL VESTBY FIVE SIX TO A SYSTEM THAT WOULD EMBODY CAPAS FIVE CORE VALUES. SIR S. B. FIVE SIX TO SUPPORTERS ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR THE VITAL ROLE THEY ARE PLAYING AND BUILDING SUPPORT FOR SINGLE PAYER. AND EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT IT AND FOR MOVING THE CALIFORNIA SENATE AND ASSEMBLY FORWARD IN YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE CONCEPT. THE BACKERS OF ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT CATALYST ROLE. CAPITA RESPECT THE ADVOCATES AND SUPPORTERS OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. AT THE SAME TIME WE FEAR THAT THE BILL ITSELF AS LANGUAGE AND OF NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED WILL PREVENT ITS PASSAGE. THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL'S LANGUAGE HAVE BEEN ELABORATED BY OTHERS AND I WILL NOT REPEAT THEM HERE. CAPITA HOPES THAT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO CAN BE AMENDED TO PRESENT A MORE REALISTIC TRANSITION ALONG THE LINES I'VE LAID OUT. WE ARE VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE BILL'S AUTHORS AND IT'S KEY SUPPORTERS TO THAT AND. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY KAPPA STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN A USEFUL CONSTRUCTIVE AND TRULY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. BASED ON CAMPUS FIVE CORE VALUES. SOME OF CRITICIZED APPROACH IS INCREMENTALISM BUT WE AND CAPITA CALL THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING. THERE THREE TAKEN POINTS TO REMEMBER FIRST THE STRATEGIC TRANSITION INTO PHASES AS NECESSARY AND MUST ENGAGE OFFICE KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE AGREEMENT ON THE THE GOAL OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BASED ON OUR FIVE CORE VALUES. SECOND NEW FEDERAL WAIVER LEGISLATION IS NEEDED. AND THIRD. THE WORK OF DEVELOPING THIS PHASE STRATEGIC TRANSITION PLAN IS BEING DONE BY CAP AND OTHERS IN THE ROADMAP PROCESS. LAST SLIDE PLEASE. THAT'S FOR. YEAH. I'M REALLY TALK TO MAKE. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED YOU HAVE MAYBE PEOPLE FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS. I OUTLINED I'VE TRIED OUTLINED VALUES VISION BASED ON THOSE VALUES A STRATEGY A PROCESS AND A GOAL. IT CLOSING MANY JUST LEAVE EVERYONE WITH SOME NUMBERS. WE NO THAT MEDICARE THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY IN WHICH ENJOYS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AS AN OVER HEAD OF ABOUT TWO PERCENT. WHILE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSURANCE CAN RANGE ANYTHING. MANY WERE DEPENDING ON THE STUDY FROM TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IN OTHER WORDS GOVERNMENT IS MORE EFFICIENT PAY FOR MEDICAL CARE IN A PREDOMINATELY PRIVATE RUN HEALTH CARE'S DELIVERY SYSTEM BY A FACTOR OF FIVE TO TWELVE TIMES. IN THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSURANCE INDUSTRY. GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY INVESTORS. PAY EXECUTIVE STOPWATCH STOCK OPTIONS BILL HUGE SKYSCRAPERS OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOT PAY FOR NEEDED MEDICAL CARE TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE IN FROM SEVERAL STUDIES WE KNOW THAT FOR EACH ONE MILLION UNINSURED ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE A PREMATURE DEATH EVERY YEAR DUE TO LACK OF INSURANCE. IN CANADA THE UNITED KINGDOM FRANCE AUSTRALIA JAPAN GERMANY AND OTHER WEALTHY NATIONS THAT NUMBER ZERO. THANKS TO THE ACA AND EXPANSIONS IN MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ALL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED. BUT THE JOB ISN'T FINISHED. RIGHT NOW ALMOST THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL DYING EVERY YEAR JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT'S EIGHT PEOPLE A DAY ONE EVERY THREE HOURS. HOW MANY MORE MUST DIE BEFORE WE ACHIEVE A CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS UNIVERSAL GUARANTEED? COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE GETTING TWO ZERO IS UP TO ALL OF US. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO PRESENT TESTIMONY TO THE SECT COMMITTEE. REVIEW THE CHARGE AND WORK OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE A SERIOUS AND MEANINGFUL WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO CONTINUE CYST YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS. IF THERE'S TIME I'LL ASK MY COLLEAGUE IN KAPPA BOARD MEMBER DR ARTHUR CHEN TO MAKE SOME BRIEF REMARKS. HE'S A MUCH SMARTER THAN ME CAN ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS. BUT I ALSO FAILED IN MY ROLE AS HIS SLIDE CHANGER AND SO. IF. GOOD AFTERNOON AN THANK YOU AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF BECAUSE OF THE MAIN POINT OF MY BEING HERE IS TO ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR ARE THE CHEN I AM A PRACTICING FAMILY PHYSICIAN FOR THE LAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS. AT ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER THAT IS IN THE SAFETY NET FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY. I'VE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ON SINGLE PAYER FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THE ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN FOR PROP ONE EIGHTY SIX ARE STARTING CALIFORNIA. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY IN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ALSO A CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. PLAN WHICH IS THE ALAMEDA LIGHTS FOR HELP BACK IN ITS EARLIER DAYS. I'VE HAD AN ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGE. AND VANTAGE POINT OF BEING THE BOARD CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT. A HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THAT YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT IS SUPPORTED MANY THE PROGRESSIVE CHANGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE AN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S WITH THESE DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS THAT HAS INFORMED ME ABOUT OUR HEALTHCARE CRISIS THEY WERE IN AND HOW WE'RE APPROACHING IT AND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT. THEORETICAL BUT ARE ACTUALLY VERY PRACTICAL MODELS THAT HAVE AMAZING TRACK RECORDS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THAT ARE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING IT IN A VERY COST EFFECTIVE WAY. AND ARE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES QUALITY AND GENERATES OUTCOMES. AND I'M JUST TAKING ONE STEP BACK AND LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND THINKING OF WHERE WE ARE. AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THANK YOU. ARE SPECIFICALLY CHAIRMAN WOULD AND AND ALSO CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA. FORT DELVING THIS DEEPLY INTO THIS ISSUE IT TRULY IS HISTORIC AND IT WAS LONG OVERDUE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS WELL AS SINGLE PAYER NOW HEALTH CARE FOR ALL A NUMBER OF THESE VERY DEDICATED. AND PASSIONATE. PEOPLE WHO CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE HEALTH STATUS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PUT IN THEIR TIME. AND SHOW THEIR PASSION. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY SHOW THEIR PASSION. AN HOPEFULLY. HOPEFULLY ALL OF YOU CAN TAKE THAT NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK LEVEL. BUT TAKE IT AS A SIGN OF HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOTTEN. AND HOW THEY ARE TAKING AND WE ARE TAKING OWNERSHIP FOR THIS PROBLEM. WE'RE TAKING OWNERSHIP IN THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN AS PRIVATE CITIZENS AND ORGANIZATIONS BY EXPRESSING PUBLIC WILL. IT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE IN A VERY FORTHRIGHT WAY THAT MAY HAVE SOME ABRASIVE EDGES TO IT. IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE AS WELL AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THIS AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW I THINK FROM MICE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT OF BEING. THE HEALTH CARE PHYSICIAN FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS IS JUST INCREDIBLE. AND I WANT TO JUST THANK EVERYBODY FOR THAT CONTRIBUTION. HYPE A LOOK AT S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO AND I AND I WENT THROUGH IT AGAIN LAST NIGHT I HAD PRESENTED IT TO THE NORTH CALIFORNIAN NEUROLOGIC SOCIETY. AND I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT A AMONG PHYSICIANS GROUPS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN AND THERE'S LOT OF FEAR. BUT I WANT TO SAY ALSO THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS FROM THE CONTEXT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. OF A PRACTICING FAMILY PHYSICIAN AS SOMEONE IS REALLY CONCERNED AS YOU ALL ARE. WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE ELEMENTS IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE PART OF A PIECE OF LEGISLATION NO MATTER WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO. WELL IN TRYING TO ADVANCE UNIVERSAL CARE I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS CARE THIS. AVOIDS THE SEPARATION OF HIGHS AND MOUTH AND HEAD FROM OUR BODY. THAT IT INTEGRATES CARE THAT IT PUTS VISION CARE AND IT PUTS YOU KNOW ORAL CARE ALL UNDER. THE HEALTH COVERAGE. HOW? COMPLEX AN IDEA IS THAT THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT RIVER SO FRAGMENTED WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT SO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THAT IN THE PROPOSAL. SENIORS AND DISABILITY. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T READ THIS IT PROVIDES FOR ADULT DAYCARE AND IN HOME CARE. WHERE IT'S CRITICALLY NEEDED ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF HER AGING PARENTS OR IS GOING THROUGH THIS YOURSELF? AS THE SENIOR THIS IS CRITICAL AND VERY MUCH A PART OF QUALITY OF CARE IN ENABLING CULT QUALITY OF CARE. WHERE DID AND I COULD GO ON? BUT THE THE. IN A PERIOD WHERE WE ARE DEALING WITH IMMIGRATION AS A BIG ISSUE. THIS IS IMMIGRANT FRIENDLY. THIS IS VERY IMMIGRANT FRIENDLY. THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT ACTUALLY ARE IN SYNC WITH OUR SANCTUARY STATE. LAWS THAT ACTUALLY KEEP INFORMATION ON IMMIGRATION STATUS PRIVATE. AND NOT DISPOSABLE TO ANYONE WHO'S LOOKING FOR THAT INFORMATION AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO THIS THERE'S ALSO ITS CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT FROM ANNA. FROM A MINORITY HEALTH STANDPOINT AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE SEE WITHIN OUR NORMAL MINORITY COMMUNITIES AROUND HEALTH DISPARITIES. THEY OPENLY DECLARED THAT WE NEED TO SEEK THE ELIMINATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES. CURRENT PROVIDE CARE AND ADDRESSED CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS. SO IN SUMMARY I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST. THAT GET PAST ALL THE ALL THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING AT YOU FROM UP PUBLIC WILL STAND POINT. AND PLEASE DON'T IGNORE THE CONTENT OF THIS BILL. WHO ARE THE THE VALUE THAT'S THERE? TRY TO AMEND IT HAS ADS ARE POSITIONING KAPPA IS WE SUPPORT AB FIVE SICK AS S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO IF AMENDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THAT DOCTOR TEARS INSKEEP BROUGHT UP. AND WE STAND WITH THEM IN SOLIDARITY IN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THE MOTIVATIONS. THE MOTIVATIONS ARE VERY REAL AND VERY SINCERE AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AT THIS POINT IN TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WITH THAT WE WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FIGURE. THANK YOU. THINKS FOR ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TODAY ESPECIALLY FROM MASSACHUSETTS. WE A BETTER WEATHER. SO MAYBE THAT'S I DRAW. BECAUSE I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHERE TO START. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE ALL HAD THE CHANCE TO WATCH THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS THAT WE GOT. I AND LET ME ALSO SAY YOU KNOW. HARM. I CAME INTO THIS. AS A HEALTHCARE USER. BUT NOT A HEALTHCARE EXPERT I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN I DON'T PLAY ONE ON TV. AND SO THIS IS BEEN A REAL HARM EDUCATION TO MAYOR REAL DEEP DIVE. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S FRUSTRATING TO A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES WHO KNOW A LOT ABOUT HEALTHCARE. THAT WE ALL HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO MAKE POLICY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND. THE BACKGROUND ALL OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS. AND. EVEN THOUGH WE SAT THROUGH MANY MANY HOURS OF HEARINGS THERE SO THEY WERE SO DANCE. THAT. FOR ME I WOULD NEED TO YOU KNOW PROBABLY TAKE A COURSE FOR MANY YEARS TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ABSORB. ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN I'M THROUGH THE COURSE OF ALL THE HEARINGS BUT I'M STARTING TO GET YOU KNOW MUCH MORE OF AN UNDERSTANDING SO. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FIRST FOUR PROFESSOR PAUL ONE. AND AGAIN THANKS AGAIN FOR COMING. SO. MY FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT. THE. THE FEE ON BUSINESSES THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DID YOUR ANALYSIS ON I THINK IT WAS YOU IT I TALKEDABOUT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT YOU LOOKED AT. TO COME UP WITH YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT'S BEING SPENT NOW. AND YEAH THE FEW THAT YOU RECOMMENDED IN YOUR ANALYSIS TO COME UP WITH THE COST BUT THE THE. OF HOW TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THE PLAN I THINK WAS A TO PERCENT AROUND A TWO PERCENT PAYROLL TAX. GROSS RECEIPTS TAX BUT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE RIGHT NOW OF COMPANIES THAT ARE PAIN FOR. PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY'RE PAYING MUCH MORE OF THAT RIGHT NOW THAN TWO PERCENT. SO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THE SPEAKERS THAT WE HAD WAS OUR MIKE. GOVERNOR OF. VERMONT WHO SAID THAT ONE OF THE MISTAKES THEY MADE WHEN THEY TRIED TO PROPOSED SINGLE PAYER IN VERMONT WAS NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINING TO THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY'RE PAYING NOW. SO THOSE COMPANIES ARE PAYING MUCH MORE. OPEN WHAT WHAT WAS YOUR. SORT OF GENERAL ASSUMPTION OF WHAT THE AVERAGE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES PRIVATE INSURANCE IS PAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL AS I AS I SAID IN MY OVERALL REMARKS. VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. IN THE WAY WE DESIGN ARE PROPOSAL. WAS PRECISELY. TO REMAIN WITHIN. THE FRAMEWORK AS ARTICULATED IN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHICH IS TO. PREFERRED TAXES WITH BROAD BASES AND LOW RIGHT. AND THE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE AND PER MONTH WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. THEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT THEY DIDN'T AYE AS IT HAPPENS I'VE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. OF THE STUDY FOR VERMONT. WHO IN MY OPINION IS THE MOST EMINENT? ECONOMIST WORKING ON SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE AND RELATED ISSUES IN THE WORLD. A DOCTOR WILLIAM SHALL OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY HE HIMSELF TOLD ME THAT THEY MADE THAT MISTAKE. THAT THEY DID NOT. ADHERE TO THIS PRINCIPLE SO THAT THEY THE. PROPOSAL WAS FOR A VERY HIGH RATE THAT GOT PEOPLE WORRY. NOW SO EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS. DESIGNING A SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH THE RATES OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MONEY. THAT THE RATES ARE NOT SO HIGH AS THAT THEY WOULD COST DISTORTIONS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SO. YEAH SO IN OUR STUDY WE HAVE. IF WE TAKE IT AS AN EXAMPLE. MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES AND WE'VE LOOKED AT TWO KINDS OF MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES WITH TEN TO NINE. ATTENDED NINETEEN EMPLOYEES OVER TWENTY TO NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES SO. RIGHT NOW. ATTENDED NINE EMPLOYEES ARE SPENDING HUNDRED AND EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON HEALTH CARE PER YEAR AND WHAT THEY WOULD PAY BY THROUGH THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX SCENARIO WOULD BE. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. SO THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX. PROPOSAL. WOULD LOWER WOULD LOWER THEIR HEALTHCARE SPENDING BY THIRTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT AS I SAID THIS IS A MAJOR BENEFIT. FOR MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS THAT'S NOT QUITE AS BIG FOR TWENTY TO NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES. BUT IN THAT CASE ARE RIGHT NOW WORST SHOWING TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX THEY PAY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THEY WOULD LOWER THEIR HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS A SHARE OF PAYROLL BY SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT. SO. CONSISTENTLY YEAH EXCEPT ARE IN SOME CASES FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF VERY LARGE FIRMS HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES. GO DOWN. AND YOU KNOW THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX IS ONE EXAMPLE I KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERN AND I READ THE. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX THAT'S FAIR. THE PUSH YOU GONNA BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY. FEE OR TAX AND ON THE OTHER HAND VERY LARGE STATES OPERATE WITH THESE THIS IS NOT A BIG SECRET PROPOSAL. WE HAVE TEXAS WE HAVE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WE HAVE THE STATE OF DELAWARE WE HAD THE STATE OF OHIO THAT DEPEND HEAVILY. ON UTILIZING THIS MEASURE SO WE CAN DO IT ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU WANTED TO GO WITH THE. OF EXTENDING THE EXISTING PAYROLL TAX. UP IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY DOABLE AS I SAID IT WOULD BE SIX POINT SIX PERCENT TO RAISE THE SAME AMOUNT OF REVENUE. AS YOU WOULD GET FROM OUR TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. GROSS RECEIPTS FEET SO. IT YOU CAN DO IT. AND TO NOTE SIX POINT SIX PERCENT IS HIGHER THAN TWO POINT THREE PERCENT BUT IT IS STILL. WITHIN RANGE OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT BE ONEROUS HAS WAS THE. THE MEASURE AND AND VERMONT. WHICH WAS IT'S UNFORTUNATE IN VERMONT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE RESEARCH DONE THE PROPOSAL IN MY OPINION. WAS OUTSTANDING. THE WORK DONE BY PROFESSOR SHALL OUTSTANDING IN MANY WAYS I MODELED OUR STUDY ON HIS. HE THEY HAD THAT ONE ISSUE THAT YOU YOUR THE CHIEF HIGHLIGHTED WHICH I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER. NOW YOU I'M YOU USE THE. PHRASE SEVERAL TIMES HE SAID DECENT INSURANCE. SO WHAT ASSUMPTIONS WERE YOU USING YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT THE TYPE OF INSURANCE THAT PEOPLE THAT THIS WOULD PAY FOR BECAUSE THIS A BIG RANGE OF INSURANCE THAT'S OFFERED BY. YOU KNOW FROM FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE FRANCE INTO SOME COMPANIES OR. GIVING. PLATINUM PLANS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY TO PEOPLE UNCOVER CALIFORNIA BUYING YOU KNOW HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE. I TYPE POLICIES TO WHAT'S IN THEM FIVE SIX TWO WHICH YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN IS. IS MUCH MORE LIKE ALONG THE PLATINUM IF NOT HIGHER. TYPE OF ANALYSIS SO WHAT WE DID YOU. DID YOU ENVISION ANY PARTICULAR COST FOUR TYPE OF INSURANCE OR. R. YOU SORT OF SPREADING THE RANGE AND FINDING AN AVERAGE AND USING THAT AS SORT OF YOUR COST ASSUMPTION. SO WHAT DOES THAT MATTER WHEN YOU DO IT SO NOW IT'S LIKE SAID THAT WELL ALL OF COURSE ALL THESE THINGS MATTER AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU DO. STUDY OF SUCH BIG SYSTEM WE HAVE TO WORK WITH AVERAGES AND WE THINK THAT RANGES WITHIN AVERAGE JUST. SO YOU KNOW THE BASIC APPROACH WAS TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT EXISTING COVERAGE. AND. WITHIN THE EXISTING COVERAGE YOU KNOW WE FIND ABOUT. FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE. EITHER UNINSURED. ARE UNDERINSURED. AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT I CAN GO THROUGH OTHER DEFINITIONS OF UNDER IN CHECKING THE THINGS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW SEVERE THAT PROBLEM. AND THEN WHAT WE SAID WAS LET'S BRING EVERYBODY WHO IS EITHER UNINSURED. OR UNDER INSURED. UP TO. FULLY INSURED SUCH THAT. THEY DO NOT FACE THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT THEY CAN'T THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T. SEE A PHYSICIAN OR THAT THEY FACE BANKRUPTCY. SO BRING EVERYBODY UP. FOR THAT LEVEL AND THAT WHAT WE SAID TO DO THAT WOULD ENTAIL. COSTS YEAH GOING UP. BY BY TEN PERCENT WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM FLOW FROM THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION. TWO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM BUT THEN THAT THE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WOULD ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS SUCH THAT WE THEN GET. EVERYBODY AT DECENT COVERAGE AT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION SO WOULD BE A NET. REDUCTION IN COSTS IN THE RANGE OF EIGHT OR NINE PERCENT WITH EVERYBODY GETTING RIGHT BUT ARE YOU WERE YOU ANTICIPATING THE TYPE OF COVERAGE THAT THE BILL CALLS FOR. PODIATRY. LONG TERM CARE YEAH YEAH ALL OF THAT REAL ISSUE IS ALSO IN THERE OKAY. NO AND THEN WILL YOU ALSO ANTICIPATING ADDITIONAL TYPES OF COST SAVINGS. BEING MORE REGULATION I MEAN CLEARLY YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING OUT A FOR PROFIT INSURANCE INDUSTRY. SIPHONING OFF OF MONEY GOING TO SHAREHOLDERS CORRECTING YOUR ASSUMPTIONS. AND ALSO THE ABILITY OF THE STATEMENTS NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY OR REGULATE WITH PHARMA ALL OF THAT SO THAT'S WERE SO YOU HAVE COST CONTAINMENT BUILT INTO YOUR MODELING THAT IS WELL. ON. OKAY. GOOD. NATIONAL TURN THANK. AND THEN DID YOU ALSO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS THAN ABOUT A FLATTENING OF. SORT OF. I DID YOU DID YOU MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FEE FOR SERVICE VERSES. YOU KNOW MORE AND I KNOW WHAT THE FREEZES FOR WHEN YOU'RE JUST DOING AB FLAT SORT OF CONTRACTING WITH A DOCTOR WITH DOCTORS. WELTER OF MEN YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IN MY READING OF THE MEASURE. THERE THAT THOSE OPTIONS ARE STILL. ON THE TABLE AND IN MY OPINION. WHAT WE NEED IS SOME COMBINATION AND I YOU KNOW IF IF I TURN TO? OUR STUDY WE ACTUALLY QUOTE FROM THE. THE BILL ITSELF. SAID THE BILL ITSELF. TALKS ABOUT SIMPLIFICATION TRANSPARENCY STANDARDS SHALL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO. IT FAIRNESS AND HEALTH CARE CREDENTIALING PARTICIPATION HEALTH CARE AND REFERRALS OF THEIRS. SO THEY AND I MY VIEW THE TO THE. LEFT OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE DRAFT LEGISLATION BROADLY MANDATES THE BOARD TO DEVELOP SINGLE PAYER AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM NOW. WHAT EXACTLY DO WE MEAN BY AN INTEGRATED? AND YOU KNOW THEIR VARIOUS WAYS TO DO THAT. SOME OF WHICH COULD INCLUDE FEE FOR SERVICE. ON SOME CONTACTS WITHIN A BROADER FRAMEWORK OF SOME KIND OF GLOBAL BUDGETING. SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT'S I THINK WHERE WE WILL INVOLVE. I'M AND WE HAVE PIECES OF THAT. IN. ALREADY IN OPERATION IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND THEY ARE HAVE GLOBAL BUDGETING. THERE THEY ARE INVOLVING IT IN A POSITIVE WAY. BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE. WITHIN A CONTEXT WHICH IT'S NOT ENTIRELY DONE NOW IN WHICH WE GUARANTEE DECENT CARE SO. THAT IS A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT IN MY VIEW IS NOT FULLY WORKED OUT. IN THE. BILL THUS FAR AND SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF STUDY IN DETAIL AND UNDERSTANDING A LOT. OF THE. MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND MAKING THEM WORK IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. MEN HAVE YOU EVALUATED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEMS VERSUS A VERY HIGHLY REGULATED NONPROFIT MULTI PAYER SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN GERMANY AND SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. IN THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEM AND WHICH. WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT THEY HAVE ENORMOUS MARKET POWER. AND THAT IS A MAJOR FACTOR HOLDING BACK THE. CREATION OF A UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEM. AND THAT THEREFORE. WHAT IS REALLY MOST CRITICAL IN MY VIEW? IS THE TRANSITION INTO A SIMPLE SYSTEM OUR A GOVERNMENT RUN SYSTEM. AND I YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD WE HAVE EXPERIENCES. WITH FOR EXAMPLE MEDICARE. WHICH HAS A LOT OF FAVORABLE OUTCOMES BUT IS ENORMOUSLY COSTLY. I WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF COST CONTROLS WITHIN IT ARE A LOT OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE. RIDERS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE STATE SO I THINK IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SYSTEM THAT THAT ACCOMPLISHES THE COST SAVINGS THAT WE NEED. I DON'T THINK WE CAN RUN IT OUR SYSTEM LIKE GERMANY'S I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE TO A SIMPLE SYSTEM WITH MINIMAL. UP DUROCHER SEE AND MINIMUM AMBIGUITY AND LASTLY IS THERE ANY CREDIBLE ECONOMIST THAT YOU KNOW OF. WHO THINKS THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM? ARE UNREGULATED. CURRENT SYSTEM. WHERE? INSURANCE COMPANIES. A WHERE WE HAVE SUCH A LACK OF REGULATION. AND. FOR CITIZENS TO. FIVE FROM COMPETING. INSURANCE POLICIES WITH VERY LITTLE CARE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUALLY CAN AFFORD. WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THIS OR ANY ECONOMIST WHO THINKS THAT THIS IS WORKING I THINK THAT'S A LOADED QUESTION? YEAH JUST SAYING NO. NO. OKAY. THANK YOU. NEXT. NEXT WE WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT HERE AND I KNOW EVERYONE WANTS TO GET THE BEST. SOLUTION FOR THE PATIENT I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS PATIENT. AND I'VE RUN UP AGAINST YOU KNOW ISSUES WITH. APPROPRIATIONS TRYING TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES THROUGH SITS LEMONADE EXCEPT THERAPIES GETTING PHYSICIANS TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THE TREATMENT THEY WANT TO THEIR PATIENTS WITHOUT ALL THE RED TAPE. SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IT. I'M GONNA PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHERE AT THE END OF THE ROLE. AS FAR AS A LOT OF OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS. AND I THINK SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED OF NINE. ASKING THEM BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO KNOW. IT'S NOT YOU KNOW. ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT UP AGAINST AS LEGISLATORS OF ONE WE'VE TRIED TO ONE BILLS IN APPROPRIATIONS. WE TRY TO SET UP A PROGRAM OR SYSTEM IN THIS ALWAYS THOSE INITIAL ONE TIME COSTS THAT COME INTO PLAY. BEFORE WE ACTUALLY THEN YOU DON'T GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF WHAT THE. THE OUTCOME WILL BE FOR THE PROGRAM. WHAT WOULD BE THE ONE TIME COSTS? A LOT TO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND OR OTHER SOURCES OF GETTING A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM OFF THE GROUND. HOME AND HOW WILL I BE PAID I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION PRETTY MUCH STATIC OPERATIONAL COSTS BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A. SET UP ON THIS. FOR ME. ARVIN WHOEVER I MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY. BECAUSE WELL THEY DEFINITELY ARE TRANSITIONAL COSTS. AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT OUR STUDY. AB VERSION CAME OUT AND MADE DOES NOT COVER THOSE. AND THAT IS IT WOULD BE A FAIR CRITICISM OF OUR STUDY BUT IT REALLY WAS JUST A MATTER OF DOING WHAT I COULD AND THE TIME FOR. SUBSEQUENTLY WE HAVE LOOKED IN IN SOME DETAIL. ARE WITH RESPECTED TRANSITIONAL COSTS. FOR PEOPLE NOW EMPLOYED. AND THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WAYS WE'RE GONNA CHIEF COST SAVING IN THE SYSTEM THROUGH IT LOWERING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. MEANS LET'S FACE IT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE NEEDED TO DO THEIR JOBS AND PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE SO WHAT WE'VE ESTIMATED. IS A FAIR TRANSITION TO MOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED. AB CURRENTLY IN PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IN OUR CALIFORNIAN THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AND AND WHAT IT ENTAILS. ARE FIRST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NEAR RETIREMENT MOVING THEM INTO. RETIREMENT. VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT. THROUGH. A GLIDE PATH TO MAINTAIN THEIR WAGES AND PENSION FUNDS. SECONDLY. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. NEAR RETIREMENT. SO THAT IS GOING TO BE. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWNTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL STILL BE NEEDED. TO MOVE INTO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM BUT THAT STILL LEAVES US WITH ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND WHO WON'T. SO WHAT WE. HAVE LOOKED INTO IS THE RATE AT WHICH. RETIREMENTS OCCUR IN OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT IN HEALTHCARE BUT IN COMPARABLE POSITIONS AND THEY RATE AT WHICH NEW OPENINGS. WOULD WOULD EMERGE THROUGH WHICH THESE PEOPLE COULD MOVE INTO AND WE ESTIMATE THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS WORTH OF NORMAL RATES OF RETIREMENT. TO GET PEOPLE INTO EMPLOYMENT IF THEY WANTED THAT EMPLOYMENT BUT WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT WAYS OF. POSITIONS FOR. WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR TWO YEARS FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T TAKE THOSE JOBS WE'VE LOOKED AT JOB TRAINING AND. RELOCATION COSTS AND ROUGHLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS I THINK IT COST. AT AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE ON TOP OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE OF AROUND ONE PERCENT OF SYSTEM COSTS FOR THREE YEARS. TO GET PEOPLE INTO AYE AYE A GOOD TRANSITIONAL SITUATION SO THE COSTS ARE REAL AND WE MAY WE CAN'T IGNORE THEM. UP BUT THEY ARE MANAGEABLE. THERE'S CERTAINLY MANAGEABLE AND AND AND WHEN WE FINISH THIS LATEST VERSION OF WHAT WE'RE DOING I WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT. DO YOU AND USED TO AND MENTIONED ABOUT ALSO RESPONDED THAT. JUST FROM A POSITION AND PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. THERE'S. PART OF WHAT AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS BUT IT'S AN IDEA THAT. MIGHT BE STUDY. PART OF THE CHAIN. THAT BUT ALSO GENERATE COSTS IS SHIFTING TO AN ENTIRE NEW. SYSTEM OUR ENTIRE NEW ROCKETS THE NINE ENTIRE NEW AGENCY AND SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT. WE WE LEARNED THIS SOMEWHAT FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA BECOMING A NEW ENTITY AND HAVING TO STAFF UP. SO THE QUESTION REALLY FOR US. IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH CAN WE PARLAY WHAT ALREADY EXISTS AND MAY AT MASSIVELY IMPROVE IT AND AYE MP AYE EMPHASIZE MASSIVELY BECAUSE IF WE THINK OF WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALREADY HAVE. WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S CALLED MEDICARE. AND IT PROVIDES A LOT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WHAT'S NEEDED IN HEALTHCARE AND AT DIFFERENT TIMES IS PROVIDED THAT COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND ACTUALLY INCLUDED PODIATRY. AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT IT NEEDS MAJOR MAJOR OVERHAUL. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN HAVING TO RECONSTRUCT AN ENTIRE AGENCY THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS IN THE COURSE OF TRANSITION OF COURSE DOLLARS ARE REAL IMPORTANT. BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT BENEFITS THAT OCCUR BECAUSE IN THAT TRANSITION FOR EXAMPLE I CAN TELL YOU FROM A POSITION OFFICE STANDPOINT. INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW NARROWING DOWN AND SIMPLIFYING OF WHAT ARE VERY COMPLEX AND RIGOROUS AND LABRYS AND YOU KNOW ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE COSTLY AS FAR AS HAVING STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH. OF DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT POLICIES AND DIFFERENT CONTRACTS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT PAIRS SO DON'T OVERLOOK THAT ASPECT OF WHAT WE WHAT WE ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCIES. ARE AND CUT DOWN ON THE COSTS BUT UNNECESSARY OVERHEAD FOR MANY MANY PHYSICIANS OFFICES AND MEDICAL GROUPS IN MANY PHYSICIANS SPEND TWENTY HOURS A WEEK ON THIS AND. IT'S EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER U. S. POSITION. COSTS IF YOU GOT A GROUP PRACTICE OF FOR BURKE TWENTY OR FIFTY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE JUST TO BE ADMINISTRATION. AND ALL THOSE THE OUR SAVINGS THERE IN THERE ALSO I THINK SAVINGS WE CAN LOOK AT FOR STREAMLINING AND. THE IMPROVING MEDI CAL AS YOU KNOW DOCTOR CHEN ALLUDED TO AND FOR INSTANCE DO WE REALLY NEED FIFTY ELIGIBILITY CODES FOR MEDI CAL. SERIOUSLY. JUST A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS ON THAT SO. THE PRIVATE. PARENTS DURING THE TRANSITION. WHAT WHAT WORLD YOU SEE FOR THEM I MEAN WILL THEY BE? PART OF THIS YOU KNOW TRYING MAYBE DOING THE BILLING MAYBE DOING ARE THEY GONNA BE SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN THE TRANSITION OR WILL THEY JUST BE. KIND OF ON THE WAY OUT. WELL THE LANGUAGE OF OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. THE LANGUAGE OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO PROVIDES THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT A FULLY OPERATIONAL UNTIL THE FEDERAL MONIES HAVE BEEN. RECEIVED AND SO THERE IS THAT PERIODOF TIME POTENTIALLY WHERE. WE ARE. TRANSITION IN THE PROGRAMMING THAT'SWHAT DOCTOR POLAND'S NEXT STUDIES GOING TO REVIEW THE SPECIFIC SEVEN CLEARLY THE CAPPER PROJECT AS WELL. BUT I'M. IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WERE THERE WILL BE PROVIDED PRIVATE INSURANCE DURING THAT TRANSITION PERIOD IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THE INSURERS WILL. YOU KNOW DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO PACK UP AND GO HOME AND SO I TO FIND ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF COVERAGE. A I THINK THAT THAT THE REALITY IS IS THAT THE. COVERAGE THAT FOLKS CURRENTLY GET IS HERE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER SEVENTY PERCENT PUBLICLY FUNDED AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE PUBLIC RESOURCES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO REALLOCATE DURING THAT TRANSITION PERIOD AS WELL. AT LEAST ON THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT'S WE ANTICIPATE. WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVES WOULD BE NEEDED? QUESTION THE IMPACT OF LARGE COST JOBS OR REVENUE DECLINES WHICH. WE SEE ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW IN ANY BUDGET. YOU KNOW. AND WELL YEAH THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S A GREAT QUESTIONS ANOTHER ONE THAT IS NOT IN OUR STUDY VOTE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WORKED THROUGH IT AND. I'LL BE ABLE TO SEND YOU SOME DRIVERS ALSO ON THAT. BUT LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT. IN IN THE BASICS. HOW WE'VE LOOKED AT A FOR EXAMPLE THE PAYING THE PAYROLL TAX OPTION WHICH I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT? THE GROSS RECEIPTS WOULD BE ON YOU KNOW. SIMILAR SO WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IS THE. THE RANGE. OF JUMPING UP AND DOWN. AND YOU KNOW FOR THOSE EITHER A MEMBER. YEARS STATISTICS. THE STANDARD DEVIATION AROUND THE AVERAGE. HAS ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT MEANING SO THAT IF IF WE WE'VE GOT A GIVEN AMOUNT. OF REVENUE A YEAR. SOME YEARS IT'LL GO UP BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT SOME YEARS AND THEN IN THE MAXIMUM CUT DOWN BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLE FOR CREATING RESERVE FUND IS INSTRUCTORS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD ONCE YOU. KNOW WHAT THE LONG TERM AVERAGES. THEN WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO OBSERVE. IS YOU KNOW. THE JUMPS UP AND THE JOHN STEM. AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO THEIR FOUR DO IS A INCORPORATE A PROVISION THROUGH WHICH WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD YEAR I JUMP UP. YOU DON'T SPEND THAT MONEY YOU PUT IT IN THE RESERVE FUND. AND THAT IS THAT EXACTLY GOING TO BE MATCHED. BY THE YEARS WHEN YOU GO DOWN BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT YOU WILL HAVE THE MONEY IN RESERVE FROM THE UP. SO. IT IT'S NOT HARD TO DESIGN A RESERVE FUND THAT WILL BE VIABLE WHAT WOULD BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGES YOU KNOW FOR THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS UNTIL YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST UP YEAR. HAD YOU COVER THAT SO FOR THE FIRST FOR THE INITIALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO START PUTTING IN THE RESERVE FUND. AS AN ADDITIONAL INCREMENT FOR THE FIRST YEAR FINANCING BUT AFTER THAT. IT'S REALLY NOT A VERY HARD PROBLEM. GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS OBSERVE THEIR RANGE OF VARIATION AROUND THE LONG TERM AVERAGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING COMING IN. CAN I RESPOND ALSO JUST. AND IT SOMEWHAT RELATES TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION AROUND THE ROLE OF PRIVATE INSURANCE. THIS IS WHY IN THE SINGLE PAYER MODEL WE REALLY HAVE TO. HAVE IT AS PUBLICLY FINANCED. AND. FOR LEASE FOR A MINIMUM BENEFIT PACKAGE A MINUTE BEEN BASELINE YOU KNOW BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT EVERYONE. CAN CAN YOU KNOW FEEL COVERED BY AND. AS A RESULT OF THAT IMPORTANCE OF THE ACTUARIAL SPREAD BECAUSE TO AVOID THE DOWN YEARS. TO AVOID THE DOWNED SWINGS AND THE REVENUE THAT COMES FROM THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ACTUARIAL SPREAD OF HEALTHY. WORKING PEOPLE AND HEALTHY CHILDREN AND SO ON THAT ARE STILL. PART OF THAT TAX BASE. AND SO IF THAT'S SIPHONED OFF BECAUSE OF HAVING A LARGE ROLL OF. OF PRIVATE INSURERS THEN WE LOSE THAT BENEFIT COME THE ROLE IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SINGLE PAYER AS WELL AS OTHER MULTI PAIRS DISTANCE. THERE'S STILL A ROLE FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THAT IS REALLY ONCE WE ESTABLISH THE FOR FLOOR AND THE BASIC MINIMUM BENEFITS PACKAGE. IF PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT THERE'S AN OPTION TO BE ABLE TO GO PRIVATE INSURANCE AND DO THAT. WHAT YOU'LL SEE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BECAUSE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE VERY KEEN ON THEIR PROFIT MARGIN? IS A LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE MULTIPLE PRODUCT LINES UMD AND YOU LIFE INSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE. THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING THEY'RE. GETTING SECOND GUESSES ABOUT STAYING IN THE MARKET. AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THE MARGIN FOR THEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES JUST STARTING TO NARROW DOWN AND AND NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN WITH OUR FRAGMENTATION. AND A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW NURSES. WHICH IS WHY S. B. FIVE SIX TWO MOVES EXPEDITIOUSLY TO TRANSITION FROM THE INSURANCE BASED SYSTEM TO. S. INTO HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AND I AND I AND I THINK THAT. CERTAINLY THIS AS A MINIMUM BENEFIT PACKAGE IS NOT A CONCEPT IN S. B. FIVE SIX TO THE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS. ARE THE PACKAGE BECAUSE THE BIGGER THE ROLE FOR. THE GOOD OF THE ROLE FOR THE PRIVATE ENSURES. LESS EFFICIENT AND LESS SAVINGS AND MORE WASTE THERE IS IN THE SYSTEM SO WE THAT'S WHY WE'VE. AFFORD A VERY COMPREHENSIVE. BENEFIT PACKAGE TO REDUCE THE ROLE OF PRIVATE INSURANCE TO SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS OKAY SO LET'S GET INTO SOME OF THE CHARTS CRIME. DARPA DOT TO POLAND. ON TABLE NINE. YOU YOU'RE OUTLINING SOME OF THE OVERALL COST SAVINGS THROUGH A. CALIFORNIA SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. ESTIMATES OBVIOUSLY. SO YOU'RE ESTIMATING HEALTH SPENDING WILL BE REDUCED BY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. AS A RESULT OF REDUCTIONS IN UNNECESSARY SERVICES. REDUCED FRAUD OTHER EFFICIENCIES. WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS ESTIMATE IS ARE THERE SOME CONCRETE FIGURES OR STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT COULD POINT TO? A YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S KIND OF A BROAD THING UNNECESSARY SERVICES AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHAT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT A LOT OF THE THINGS WITH. STEPPED THERAPIES OPINION ON DIALS ON ALL THOSE COSTS THAT GO INTO ALL OF THAT. NAVIGATING A VERY. YOU KNOW BROADSYSTEM. HOW HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE FIVE PERCENT? DIDN'T THINK SANTA SOME CARE BEING PROVIDED TODAY IS NOT HIGH VALUE CARE. WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE HONOR FULLY? PUBLICLY FINANCED SYSTEM. THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE FIGURES HERE LIKE ALL OF THE FIGURES ON COST SAVINGS COME FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE. OTHER FEE FOR IS THE STARTING POINT FOR OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FIVE PERCENT. IS FROM A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN STUDY BY THE U. S. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE WHICH IS THE. MEDICAL BRANCH OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. THE TWO THAT TWO THOUSAND AND TEN STUDY. ESTIMATED THAT WASTE OF NOT TOTAL WASTE BUT WASTE IN THESE FOUR CATEGORIES UNNECESSARY SERVICES INSUFFICIENTLY DELIVERED SERVICES MISS PREVENTION OPPORTUNITIES AND FRAUD. WAS NOT FIVE PERCENT WAS NINETEEN PERCENT. OKAY NINETEEN PERCENT NOW ARE AS WE GO THROUGH IN OUR STUDY. THAT WAS A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN STUDY AND AS WE GO THROUGH THERE IS. MORE RECENT RESEARCH. THAT AFFIRMS THAT. BASIC FINDING AREACTUALLY A SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBER IS. TOO LOW. NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT OKAY THAT'S NOT REALISTIC. THAT YES THERE'S ALL THIS WASTE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AT IT. THERE IS NO WAY TO GET AT IT SO THERE'S NO POTENTIAL SAVINGS I'VE I'VE RECEIVE THAT CRITICISM FROM OUR ON OUR REPORT FROM PEOPLE I RESPECT. I DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE. IF YOU CANNOT GET AT IT IN ANYWAY EVEN UNDER A TOTALLY REORGANIZED ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE THEN ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WASTE. IT'S PART OF HOW THE SYSTEM OPERATES. SO A. LOT WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED THE FIVE PERCENT IS ACTUALLY A VERY LOW FIGURE. RELATIVE TO THE SERIOUS RESEARCH LITERATURE INCLUDING. THE WORK OF. THE PERSON WHO WAS THE. THE HEAD OF THE OF THE. SEE A MASS UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. FOR SOME TIME AT HOME WHO HAS READ OUR STUDY AND ACTUALLY SAID YOUR NUMBERS ACTUALLY. LOW. SO WE THINK THAT'S IT AYE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS IN THIS AREA AND. PART OF WHAT GETS US THE SAVINGS IS A THROUGH INSTITUTING A SOME KIND OF A GLOBAL BUDGETING SYSTEM. AND. AND THEN ALSO INCLUDING WITH THAT THE. THE TYPES OF. COMMITMENTS TOOK. TO CARE AND TO. THE. THE THE. BOARD THAT IS PROPOSED THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT INTO THESE AREAS SO WE HAVE THE THE COST CONTAINMENT WE HAVE THE. SYSTEM OF REVIEW AND. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET. SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FIVE PERCENT OUT OF THE ROUGHLY TWENTY PERCENT. THAT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE SAYS EXISTS AND IN THE AREAS OF WASTE AND BY THE WAY THIS FIVE PERCENT FIGURE. OUT THE STUDY FOR VERMONT THAT WAS REFERRED TO BEFORE. THEY SAY IT'S TWENTY PERCENT. A SO MY NUMBER IS ACTUALLY QUITE LOW RELATIVE TO WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE LOW BECAUSE IF YOU EXPERIENCE BETTER SAVINGS THAN BUT SOLD BETTER HOW ARE YA ENSURE. THAT BUT WHAT WE WE DIDN'T WE DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT TO GET A PRESENT YOU ALL OF YOU DECISION MAKERS. WITH UNREALISTIC FIGURES. SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW OUR STUDY NATURALLY EVERY STUDY IS CRITICIZED. AND A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS HAVE OF VALUE NO DOUBT SOME OF THEM DON'T BOOK OKAY. BUT THAT THE POINT IS THAT WHAT WOULD WHEN WE GOT THAT THE MAIN AREA OF FOCUS OF CRITICISMS WAS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF COST SAVINGS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NET. YOU KNOW THE DEBATE THAT'S GONE ON A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS KIND OF CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT SOME PEOPLE SAY WE ARE TOO LOW AND OUR ESTIMATE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WE ARE TOO HIGH ON THIS FIVE PERCENT TO FIVE PERCENT A YEAR AGO RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY PERCENT THAT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE SAYS IS WASTE. OVERALL I THINK OUR OVERALL ESTIMATE OF EIGHTEEN PERCENT SAVINGS IS A CONSERVATIVE NUMBER AT AN ATTAINABLE AND ATTAINABLE NUMBER REALISTIC. ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS INCORPORATED INTO ON THEIR SERVERS SERVICES WAS ALL. AND IT ON TESTING. YOU HAVE THIS TEST YOU NEED THAT HAS TO AND I THINK IT'S PART OF THAT IS. BASED ON THE CONCERN OF MALPRACTICE AND LAWSUITS AND YOU KNOW IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE. YOU KNOW I HAVE MY BROTHER'S A POSITION. MALPRACTICE JUST. COVERAGE YOU KNOW HOW TO AND HE'S NOT IN CALIFORNIA'S AND NEW YORK SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE EVEN HAVE HERE. THAT IS A BIG DEAL I THINK THOSE LAWSUITS. IS THAT ADDRESSED IN SOME OF THIS UNNECESSARY SERVICES BECAUSE I THINK THE RESULT OF LAWSUITS IS EXTRA TESTING. YEAH I MEAN SO THERE WE TO DO WE DISCUSS IN THE AND THE STUDIES WHAT IS CALLED IN THE LITERATURE PHYSICIAN INDUCED DEMAND. WHERE PHYSICIANS EITHER? ARE SUGGESTING EXCESSIVE TESTING BECAUSE THEIR FEES THAT THEY CAN A GENERATOR OR BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF LOS. AND SO ONE WHEN YOU MOVED TO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WITH A SIMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE AND CLEAR GUIDELINES. WITH THE INTEGRATED CARE OF GLOBAL BUDGETING. THOSE KIND THEY THE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE GONNA GO AWAY ENTIRELY THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIMINISHED AND THAT'S HOW WE GET THE SAVINGS. I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR. THAT IN IN TRANSITIONING TO ANOTHER SYSTEM LIKE THIS THERE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE A REFORMER IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ALREADY DOING THE MOVING FROM VOLUME BASED. PAYMENT TO A VALUE BASED. AND LOOKING AT. EVIDENCE BASIS WHAT TYPES OF MODELS OF CARE WORK BETTER IN A FEE FOR SERVICE VERY INEFFICIENT VERY VOLUME BASED. A NONPROFIT INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW EVIDENCE SPACES FOR THAT IS OF IS GOOD SO I THINK WE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES. IN DOING THIS BESIDES SAVING MONEY. IMMEDIATELY OR THE LONG RUN TO REFORM HOW MEDICAL CARE IS DELIVERED. IN AND USING THE EVIDENCE BASIS THAT MAKES IT YOU KNOW MORE EFFICIENT. I AND. EVAN SPACES FOR APPROPRIATE CARE. QUALITY REPORTING. OF ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS PERFORMANCE YOU KNOW ACCESS SERVICE QUALITY. WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT S. B. FIVE SIX TWO DOES THAT IN A BETTER WAY. THEN THE KIND OF PRACTICES THAT ARE USE NOW. TO THE VALUE OF PAIN FOR VALUE OVER VOLUME HAS NOT SAVE MONEY IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS A. MANDATE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT HAS NOT YET PROVEN ITS EFFICACY AND IN FACT RECENT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE MODELS INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST POOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SO WE WOULD OBJECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE DOCTOR TURNS IN SKI SPEAKING OF. IN THE INTERIM WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE STILL IN CHARGE THERE'S NO CONTROL OVER COSTS OR PRICES AND IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THERE'S EVERY INCENTIVE. TO REDUCE CARE IN ORDER TO FURTHER THE BOTTOM LINE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT KIND OF SYSTEM NOW COURSES KAISER PERMANENTE A. THEY MAKE A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY QUARTER. A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY QUARTER. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIED. THIS ONE TO DEVIATE REALLY QUICK ANA TO SCHOOL SIDEBAR BEFORE AGAIN INTO MY NEXT FINANCE QUESTION. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD IN ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS WHEN WE LOOKED AT INTERNATIONAL NAM APPLICATIONS OF. EITHER ATTEMPTS THAT SINGLE PAYER OR AT LEAST UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WITH MULTIPLE PAYING SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPED. DELIVERY OF SERVICE ACTUALLY CARED OF THE PATIENT WHICH IS THE BIG DEAL IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING CARE. WAS THIS SOCIAL SERVICE NETWORK THAT WAS AROUND THEM. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE. YOU KNOW HERE WE HAVE. THE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS WE SAW THAT SLIDE. AND HAS A LOT OF THINGS TO DO WITH ACTUAL. PROCEDURES OR YOU KNOW TESTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT. IS THERE OF PLACE OR IS IT INCLUDED TO INCREASE THE SOCIAL SERVICE NETWORK AROUND. THE WHOLE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE CARE COORDINATOR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO DO UNDER S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WHERE EVERY EVERY MEMBER EVERY CALIFORNIAN EVERY RESIDENT WILL HAVE A MEDICAL HOME. A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET ASSISTANCE NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM WHERE THERE ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING WILL BE WHERE THEY CAN HAVE. MEDICAL RECORDS ACCESSIBLE SO IT TO US THAT REALLY DOES FULFILL THAT FUNCTION OF OF CREATING A SUPPORT. SORT OF SUPPORT SERVICES AROUND THOSE AND THEN WE ELIMINATE THE MEANS TESTING THE CURRENTLY EXISTING MEDI CAL FOR THOSE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. SO WE ALSO EXPAND. THAT PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO HEALTH CARE OR GET THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY GETTING ONLY FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS EVERY CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO. SO WE DO THINK THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE SOME OF THAT. SOME OF THOSE. ANCILLARY. SERVICES AND EFFICIENT SPENDING ON THE SERVICES THROUGH OUR CARE COORDINATOR PROGRAM. AND THAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT'S INCLUDED IT. CAN I HAVE CAN I ADD TO THAT. SO THAT SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A BIG INVESTMENT AND A QUALITY THAT IS VERY STRONG. IN THIS PROPOSAL. AND THE FIELD IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK IN CALIFORNIA YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE INITIATIVE IN TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE SPEND OUR MEDICAID DOLLARS. AND REALIZING THAT MANY OF THE AFFLICTIONS. GOV ARE CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND CONFRONTED WITH. ARE ROOTED IN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND SO THAT PUTS A NEW. ADVANTAGE TO HAVING A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RAPIDLY THINK ABOUT HOW OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. INTERACTS WITH OUR HOUSING SYSTEM THAT INTERACTS WITH ARE. MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND INTERACTS WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AS AN EXAMPLE IF YOU WANNA FIGHT DIABETES AND OBESITY. YOU'VE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK ATOUR TRANSPORTATION PARTNERS WHO DECIDE WHERE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS GOING TO GO OVER SIDEWALKS ARE GONNA GO OVER BY PATHWAYS ARE GONNA GO. SO THIS IS GOING TO FORCE A NEW KIND OF COLLABORATION BUT WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT PAYERS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF MOTIVATION AROUND DEALING WITH NON MEDICAL THINGS. THEN TO HAVE A SINGLE PAYER GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE. HEALTH OF THE POPULATION AND THAT CAN WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE MODE WITH THESE DIFFERENT JUST. I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT OF THOSE SERVICES. I HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THE GO VETO THAT ACTUALLY HAD WOMEN MISDEMEANORS GETTING TRANSPORTATION GETTING. THE SERVICES GETTING OFF FOR THE SUBSTANCE ABUSES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO EXISTING FUNDING AND I GOT VETOED SO YOU CAN SEE THE WEIGHT WHERE HURT STATE IS ON THAT. OKAY. QUICKLY. I AM CONFUSED HOWEVER ABOUT THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN OFFICES. HOW THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO LOWER HOLD SPENDING? THE PROPOSAL WAS THAT PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS BE PAID AT MEDICARE RATES. AN ESTIMATE THE SAVINGS FROM THAT PROPOSAL IF PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO REDUCE COSTS BY LAYING OFF BILLING RELATED STAFF. HOW WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED COSTS FOR CONSUMERS? IF THE PROVIDERS ARE STILL BEING PAYING MEDICARE RATES SO THAT OUTLAY IS STILL THERE BUT. HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE THAT WORKING IS IF? ULTIMATELY THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE PAYMENT RATES EVEN LOWER THE SOMETHING. OKAY SO IN OUR. PROPOSAL AND. YEAH I THIS I DIDN'T PUT UP THE SLIDES BECAUSE I WANTED TO LOOK AT ME. BUT. IF WE GO TO TABLE STAFF AND WHICH I GUESS IS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. WE HAVE. THREE SOURCES. OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. AND SO THOSE WOULD BE. ADMINISTRATION WITHIN HOSPITALS ADMINISTRATION AND DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. AND THEN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE BREAK THOSE OUT. ARM ONE BY ONE SO THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVE. NOW THAT'S DISTINCT IN OUR CATEGORIZATION FROM THE SAVINGS THAT WOULD ACCRUE THROUGH MOVING. TO UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES. SAID THE UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES. YEAH SO WE HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS AND HOSPITALS ONE POINT THREE PERCENT. I. AND THEN WE GET THAT BY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO SAVE FORTY PERCENT ON ADMINISTRATION WHICH ACTUALLY IN AS AGAIN IT'S A LOW NUMBER RELATIVE TO. WHAT WE'VE HEARD AND SO FORTH? NOW. MOVING TO THE MEDICARE RATES. THE. S. AS WAS REFERRED TO A MOVING TO UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES WOULD MEET ME IN A RATE INCREASE RELATIVE TO MEDI MEDI CAL. AND WOULD MEAN A REDUCTION RELATIVE A TO PRIVATE. SO THERE THERE IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE. THE DOCTOR TO ACTIONS KEY RAISED ON THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN. AS AS DOCTORS DZERZHINSKY ALSO MENTIONED. WHEN THAT THE PHYSICIANS OFFICES ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED. FROM HAVING TO COVER THE THESE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND THE TIME SPENT THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO ALSO. BRING IN. MORE PATIENTS AND SO THOUGH THE RATES ARE RELATIVE TO PRIVATE RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN. THE AMOUNT OF TIME DEVOTED TO BILLABLE HOURS WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE AND. WE WILL HAVE MORE PATIENTS COMING IN BECAUSE EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE DECENT CARE SO WE THINK THAT. ON BALANCE. PHYSICIANS HAVE. INCOME WILL NOT BE HURT BY THIS MEASURE. AND DATA I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT. ONCE YOU OPEN UP ACCESS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PHYSICIANS WE WILLING TO SEE PATIENTS. NOW THAT THEY'RE NOT SEEING NOW YOU WORLD. GET CONTROL OF YOUR. ASTHMA HEART DISEASE. HYPERTENSION. BOB DIABETES OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES. RIGHT NOW THERE'S A HUGE COST BECAUSE THESE PATIENTS ARE BEING SEEN WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND REGULAR. PRIMARY CARE WHETHER THESE QUANTITIES CAN BE MANAGED A SHOP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER HOSPITALIZATION RIGHT FOR THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE ARE NOT UNDER REGULAR. PRIMARY CARE WHERE THE GETTING CONTINUITY OF CARE. OPENING UP LIKE THIS TO DOCK. BUMPING UP THAT TYPE OF ACCESS TO PHYSICIANS WOULD BE EXCEPT ACCEPTING MORE PATIENTS LIKE THIS WILL OVER TIME REDUCE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ADMISSIONS SO THEY WILL CUT COSTS THAT WAY. IMMEDIATELY BUT OF AN UP FRONT INVESTMENT BUT OVER TIME TO WILL BE SAVINGS BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF CARE WILL IMPROVE. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. A LOT OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES THEY ALL WILL GO DOWN. HOW MANY? I WAS GOING TO ADD THAT WE CAN ASSUME THAT DOCTORS ARE GOING TO WORK THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS THEY'RE WORKING NOW UNDER. THE NEW SYSTEM BUT THEY WILL NOT BE SPENDING THE HOURS ON ADMINISTRATION SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY BE MORE CLINICAL HOURS AVAILABLE TO THEM IS. AS STEVE SAYS AND SO WE TALK ABOUT THE POSITION SHORTAGE WELL THE BEST WAY TO CREATE MORE TIME FOR PHYSICIANS TO DO CLINICAL TREATMENT. IS TO ELIMINATE THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE TIME AND SING AND CRY SIX TWO DOZEN. I'M IS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY BE LAID OFF OR. REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM. YEAH SO SO AS I MENTIONED IN IN THE HEALTH. OUR INSURANCE INDUSTRY. RIGHT NOW THE STATE EMPLOYEES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND IF WE IF YOU TAKE THESE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE THIS ESTIMATE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. THAT WOULD MEAN ROUGHLY HALF OF THEM. BUT GET A LAID OFF FROM THEIR EXISTING POSITION. THE OTHER HALF COULD BE MOVED INTO THIS ADMINISTERING THE STATE PROGRAM AT YOU KNOW. TWICE THE LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY AND SO WHAT WE THEN. WORK THROUGH OUR WAYS THROUGH WHICH TO EITHER AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSE TO RETIREMENT MOVE THEM INTO RETIREMENT. WITH A WITH A WAGE KAREN TEETH UNTIL THEIR PENSION KICKS AND. AND SECONDARILY. TO. TO MOVE PEOPLE IF THEY SO CHOOSE INTO COMPARABLE TYPE POSITIONS IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATION AND SO WE ACTUALLY WORK THROUGH SOME DETAILS ON THAT AND WE LOOKED AT HOW OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH CARE. WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF SKILL SETS ON IN OTHER AREAS OF? OF STATE ADMINISTRATION THAT IN WHICH THESE PEOPLE COULD EASILY MOVE. AND SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS. THAT OF THOSE POSITIONS. THE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT AGE RANGE OF SIXTY AND OVER. ALL PEOPLE LIKE ME. THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND SO THAT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD WE THINK WE COULD MOVE. IF PEOPLE WANT THOSE JOBS L. INTO THOSE OUR OTHER JOBS AND IN ADDITION WE ALSO. PROVIDE FOR THEM. RETRAINING FOR TWO YEARS OF WAGE INSURANCE UP PENSION GUARANTEES AND THROUGH THAT AS I SAID THERE WERE THERE ARE COSTS AND THE COST WOULD BE I THINK IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF SYSTEM COSTS FOR THREE YEARS. TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO. AT IT COULD TEACH ALTERNATIVE SITUATION. AND THEY'LL NEVER LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. YEAH. IN A. I THINK TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT QUESTION TO THE DELIVERY SINCE BECAUSE I HEARD YOU SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT. DOWN ON CARE RATES BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AS MANY BILLER'S STORY YOU KNOW DEALING WITH ALL THE. THE PAPERWORK. THERE ARE SO MANY DEMANDS AT THAT POINT OF DELIVERY OF THE POINT OF SERVICE RIGHT NOW. DAY CREATIVE THINKING IS THERE AROUND HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD TECHNICALLY THAT ENDS UP YET I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE LOT ISSUES RELATED TO THAT BUT FROM. A FROM A WORK STANDPOINT. IT TAKES AWAY JOBS BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU DON'T NEED STAFF TO DEAL WITH FILES AND AND RETRIEVING FILES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S ALL ELECTRONIC. BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IT ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES WE'VE TAKEN AND LOOKED AT THE POOL OF FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING IN MEDICAL RECORDS AND ABLE TO SHIFT RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND INTERPRETATION AROUND CULTURAL LINGUISTIC APPROACHES. AND AROUND A COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS SO THAT THERE'S RE DIRECTION AND A LITTLE BIT OF REAP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RETRAINING. AND HOSPITALS ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION WHERE AS AS WE BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE HOW WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND JUST THE STRAIGHT MEDICAL MODEL AND NOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS NON CLINICAL ISSUES. THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WILL INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE NEED TO COME INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THEN THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW WORKFORCE THAT ENDS UP EVOLVING FROM THAT AND WE ARE LOOK AT A LIMITED CAPACITY CURRENTLY. WITHIN MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE MOST OF THESE HAPPEN TO BE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT DON'T GET THE TYPE OF UP PUBLIC INTEREST TO AND. POLICY SETTING AND THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY MOVE TO CREATING AND STRENGTHENING THOSE KINDS OF RESOURCES WHEN OUR WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THE SINGLE PAYER WOULD DO. AND THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE A LOT OF THE SAVINGS ARE BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS EVOLUTION OF THE WAY WE PRACTICE MEDICINE AND NOT IGNORING AND SAYING THIS IS OF. THIS THIS IS A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR THIS IS A MEDICAL OFFICE WE DON'T DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM BUT ACTUALLY INTEGRATING OUR APPROACH AT THE POINT A SERVICE LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE BETTER CARE. I'M SORRY I'M JUST AS ONE MORE QUESTION I'LL SAVE ALL MY OTHER THROUGH LATER BECAUSE. AND I WANT TO TAKE A FULL TIME. UP I LOOKED AT CANADA. IN GREAT BRITAIN AND WE HAVE LOTS OF STUDIES BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW THEY'VE BEEN THE ADVOCATING AND. SOME OF THE UPS AND SOME OF THE DOWNS. ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IN CANADA. AND HERE AS WELL A PRIMARY LIVE WOMEN I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF WOMEN WHO WORK IN THAT CAPACITY IN HEALTH CARE NOW. DOING THE FILING OF THE CLAIMS AND HANDLING DENIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR THEIR DOCTORS. THERE WERE LAID OFF AND PHYSICIAN'S SALARIES. IT ON AVERAGE WORK COSTS. YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SO LOW ON THE MOUND OF PHYSICIANS WHO ACTUALLY TAKE MEDI CAL WE NEED SO MANY MORE. SO IF WE ESTIMATE ABOUT A THIRD OR MEDICAL PROVIDERS THAT LEAVES TWO THIRD OF FOR OF PROVIDERS OF NOT MEDI CAL PROVIDER SO TWO THIRDS WILL SEE A CUT PAY. SO THEY'RE THOSE PHYSICIANS SALARIES IN CANADA WERE CUT TO HALF OF WHAT A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR MAKES IN THE UNITED STATES. SAVING MONEY UP FRONT. THIS BEING THE CASE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NURSES SALARIES BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK TO GREAT BRITAIN THERE STARTING SALARIES TWENTY TWO THOUSAND? I MEAN ARE WE HOPE. WE DON'T WANT TO GET TO THAT POINT SO WHAT. HOW HOW WILL OTHER HOWELL CLINICIANS AND OTHER SALARIES BE AFFECTED AS WELL SINCE WE'RE LAYING OFF PEOPLE COMING OTHER SALARIES AND WHO WERE NOT CARRYING ANY SALARIES AND HIS DOCTOR POLAN SAID? THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY WHERE THE PHYSICIANS WILL ACTUALLY NOT SUFFER A LOSS OF INCOME AND CERTAINLY THE REGISTERED NURSES WILL NOT EITHER BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IN THE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IS WERE RESTRICTING CARE IN OR DECEIVE MONEY WERE? A YOU AMERICANS GO TO THE DOCTOR LESS THAN THE AVERAGE FOR SIMILAR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WE HAVE SHORTER LENGTH OF STAYS WE USE LESS HEALTH CARE NOW. AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE BARRIERS TO CARE IF YOU LOOK AT THESE INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS AT THE COMMONWEALTH FUND AND OTHERS HAVE DONE THEY WILL TELL YOU AMERICANS USE. A LITTLE BIT LESS HEALTH CARE THAN AVERAGE BUT WE PAY A LOT MORE OUR PROBLEM ARE THE PRICES NOT THE SALARIES. AND THE DOCTORS INCOME WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE PAYING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR BILLING CLERKS SO SO THAT IS A HUGE SAVINGS FOR THEM. THEREFORE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS ACTUALLY MAINTAINING PROVIDER SALARIES BECAUSE WE. PUT EVERYONE IN RESPOND RISK POOL WE SAVE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG. COST WE SAVE ON ADMINISTRATION WE SAVE ON DELIVERY ALTHOUGH SAVINGS DOCTOR POLAN TALKED ABOUT IN ABLE US. TO THEN PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS AT A CURRENT SALARIES WITH THOSE SAVINGS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THEN WE WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IS WE SPEND SO MUCH ON HEALTH CARE THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY. IF WE SPEND IT WISELY IF WE GET OUR MONEY'S WORTH WE CAN'T COVER. EVERYBODY. SO WE'VE BEEN THROUGH FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF QUESTIONS THUS FAR AND JUST WANT TO ASK THE PANEL IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING SINCE WE HAVE. A FEW MORE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TEST QUESTIONS. AND WOULD ASK THOSE WHO ARE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE NOT TO APPLAUSE ONLY IN THAT IT. DELAYING LUNCH FOR UP. FOR YOU PRIMARILY AND. BUT WITH THAT AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY WITH A FEW MORE QUESTIONS I FOUND THIS QUITE SUBSTANTIVE AND HELPFUL SO. BOB NEXT WE WILL HAVE DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU AND AND THANK YOU ALL EVERYONE ON THE PANEL I APPRECIATE THAT I WANT TO COME AND GO BACK TO JUST TO FOLLOW UP A MISTER LIGHTLY TO WHAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON WAS JUST ASKING I'M SORRY I CUT YOU MID BITE. THAT'S OKAY. IF I HAD WHEN I WOULD EAT WHEN TO. AM YOU SAID YOU KNOW WILL SAY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PER OFFICE AND BUILDING. THOSE ARE PEOPLE'S JOB SO WHERE THOSE PEOPLE GO. IN THE W. BECAUSE YOU TALKED WITH DOCTOR POLAN ABOUT THE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES. IT YOU SAY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PEOPLE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYED IN IS IN. OUR ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH INSURANCE YEAH. I THINK THAT NUMBER IT MUST BE LOW DOCTOR TEARS ESCAPE. I KNOW IN MY OWN UP DENTAL PRACTICE I HAD TO PEOPLE. THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE THIRTY THOUSAND DENNIS IN CALIFORNIA I HAD A MODERATE SIZE PRACTICE. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND NUMBER IS MUCH YEAH THAT'S FOR PRIVATE HEALTH. THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND RELATED ACTIVITIES FROM THE U. S. QUARTERLY CENSUS OF EMPLOYMENT THE MOST RECENT DATA INDUSTRY WIDE FIGURES A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN. DO YOU HAVE. WOULD SHUT ARTS. I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME. BUT I CERTAINLY YES JOBS WILL BE LOST BECAUSE OF THAT OKAY BUT KNEW JOBS WILL BE CREATED. AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE A TRANSITION IN A HUMANE MANNER RETRAINING. EARLY RETIREMENT. YOU KNOW SURE BUT THAT'S A FACT I MEAN YES IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT. AND PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED RIGHT NOW IN THE SYSTEM THAT IS HELPING MAKE IT ENOUGH. ARE ONLY THERE BECAUSE IT IS INEFFICIENT SO YEAH WE'RE GONNA BUT DO ALSO WILL BE NEW JOBS CREATED. AND AND I GUESS THAT'S MY POINT BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SAVINGS PER OFFICE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE WILL STILL BE A PART OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IN ANOTHER POSITION AND MY IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION. THOSE. IT'S ONE THING TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WILL NOT BEAR THOSE COSTS ANYMORE. BUT THE SYSTEM STILL MIGHT IF SYSTEM WILL BEAR. SMALLER WORSHIP PORTION YEAH AND THEN THERE WILL BE. JOBS LOST AND THAT'S WHY WE I'VE GONE THROUGH SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR A JUST TRANSITION. OF PEOPLE I WHICH I DO BELIEVE IN ANY FINAL BILL SHOULD BE AN. PORTENT COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL BILL. I THINK THANK YOU JUST A. I THINK THE OTHER AND ANOTHER GO KIND OF ANOTHER FOLLOW UP TO WEAPONS WATER WAS SAYING ABOUT. SERVICES AND AND YOU TALKED ABOUT TALKED ABOUT. WHAT WE LEARNED IN OUR VERY FIRST HEARING WAS THAT? COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SINGLE PAYER. SPEND A LOT MORE ON SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH RELATES TO THE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE GREATER HEALTH OUTCOMES THINGS LIKE EDUCATION LIKE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES THERE BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T ADDRESSED BY A CARE COORDINATOR. IT IT'S IF IT'S. IN MY PIGEON SO. IF WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE BETTER BIGGER NO BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES HOW DO WHERE IS THE IT DISH NO MONEY COME FROM TO DO THAT IF BECAUSE THAT. IS NOT EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED TO US BY THE COMMONWEALTH. WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL OF THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM HAS NO ABILITY TO DO THAT. SO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO COMPARE THE PRESENT SYSTEM TO THE ALTERNATIVES. AND. SO FOR. THE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IN IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IS THEY HAVE A HIGH TAX AND FIRE MEANT USUALLY TO VALUE ADDED TAXES WHICH ARE KIND OF SALES TAX. AND NAY COMPREHENSIVELY FUND SOCIAL SERVICES WE ON THE OTHER HAND IN THE U. S. FUND THOSE SERVICES TO PRIVATE SPENDING. WE YOU KNOW EITHER OUR EMPLOYER PROVIDES BENEFITS OR WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS BY THEM ON THEIR OWN OR WE GET TAX SUBSIDIES TO PURCHASE SOME SET OF THOSE BENEFITS WHICH IN GENERAL ARE NOT EQUIVALENT. TO THE EUROPEANS JUSTICE DOCTOR CHEN SAYS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF HEALTH DISPARITIES ANNIE AND IN A QUALITY WE KNOW THE SIXTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE TWO OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS BY THE TIME THEY'RE SIXTY FIVE. THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR PREVENTIVE TREATMENT AND THE ON GOING CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH POVERTY. INADEQUATE HOUSING NUTRITION SO WE CAN'T JUST TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU. ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE QUESTIONS HOW DO YOUR RADICALLY POVERTY SO WE HAVE TO GO KIND OF TWO LEVELS BACK ULTIMATELY. AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BEYOND THE SCOPE OF S. B. FIVE SIX TO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN ELIMINATE MEANS TESTING THAT CURRENTLY PREVENTS THAT. PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY CAN'T AFFORD IT FROM GETTING THE BENEFIT AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE AMBITIOUS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS. WE CAN CREATE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BASED ON OUR VALUES. WHEAT FAVOR INTEGRATED MEDICINE WE FAVOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WE FAVOR SUPPORT SERVICES AND BROADER SOCIAL SPENDING WE FAVOR A TRANSITION SO THE PEOPLE LEAD HEALTHY LIVES NOT JUST GET MEDICAL CARE FOR DISEASE. THAT'S WHAT'S POSSIBLE HERE IF YOU REORGANIZE THE SYSTEM IN THAT KIND OF WAY THE FIVE SIX TWO ENVISIONS YOU CAN TAKE WE CAN TAKE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS I WOULD ARGUE. CHAIRMAN WOULD MORE EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THE QUESTIONS WHAT SYSTEM CAN BEST ADDRESS THAT IS FIVE SIX TWO COMPREHENSIVELY PERFECT ON THESE QUESTIONS NOW NO IT IS NOT. IS IT THE BEST FOUNDATION TO DO THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE CARE COORDINATOR. IN FACT YES THEY WROTE THE ROLE OF CARE COORDINATORS YOU KNOW AT ALSO LABEL PATIENT NAVIGATORS ALSO LABELED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO ALSO WERE LABELED CASE MANAGERS. THAT SOCIAL SERVICE PERSON THERE'S A WHOLE FIELD RIGHT NOW THAT'S EXPANDING AND THAT IS THIS AS DOCTORS INFUSE MENTIONING THAT IS AN AREA OF CREATIVE JOB GROWTH. THAT'S OCCURRING WITHIN THE HEALTH INDUSTRY WITHIN THEIR HEALTH INDUSTRY AND THAT IT'S HAD SEEN AS A DEFINITE COMPONENT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING AND THAT'LL BE AN AREA FOR FOCUSING RETRAINING AND SO ON. BUT IT IT ALSO BEGS THE POINT THAT I THINK. MISTER LADIES BRINGING UP. IT'S BETTER FOR US TO BE. COGNIZANT OF THAT AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SERIES OF INTERACTIONS AND VALUES THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT INTO OUR PUBLIC POLICY. AROUND THOSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT INCLUDE EDUCATION NAM AS YOU'RE POINTING OUT AND INCLUDE YOU KNOW THE JOB TRAINING IN. AREAS THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE UP BRING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND OUT OF THE DISPARATE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE FACING AS SUB POPULATIONS WITHIN A COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. AND BETTER TO BE INTERACTING COLLABORATIVELY ON THAT BETWEEN SYSTEMS THAT ARE LAID OUT THAT ARE RESOURCE AND VERY COMMITTED TO IT OVERALL IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. AND I'M KIND ALL OVER THE BOARD HERE SO I APOLOGIZE THERE'S NO THAT'S THE WAY MY MIND WORKS OF. SO AS WE IN ON MONDAY WE HEARD. FROM. FOLKS RELATED TO. HOW WE WOULD POTENTIALLY GET RAVE WAIVERS FROM MEDICARE HOW WE WOULD POTENTIALLY GET WAIVERS FOR MEDICAID? WE HEARD ABOUT LIKE MR FOUNTAIN TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES ARE THE THAT WE LOOK AT. RELATED TO THE CONSTITUTION AND AND AND AGAIN LIMIT AND PROP NINETY EIGHT. WE SAW THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT KIND ALL HAVE TO STACK UP. TO MAKE THIS WORK AND SO WHEN I WHEN I GET THE IMPRESSION IN ON AND IT'S NOT EVERYBODY SO PLEASE DON'T CHARACTERIZE IT THIS WAY. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO. AN OVERNIGHT. EVERYBODY HAS CARE. AND. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. DOCTORS IS KEY TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW. AND AND MENTIONED WHICH WAS ALSO MENTION ON MONDAY THE TIME IT WILL TAKE TO ACTUALLY GET WAIVERS IS SIGNIFICANT. SO AS WE LOOK AT AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY ISN'T ADDRESSED IN FIVE SIXTY TWO. IS IS IS YOU KNOW YOU'LL LEGAL TALKED ABOUT TRANSITION. BEEN YOU KNOW PARTS OF IT BUT THERE'S REALLY NOT A TRANSITION PLAN IN THERE SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU REASONABLY EXPECT. AS A TIME FRAME. FROM THE PASSAGE OF A SINGLE PAYER BILL IN CALIFORNIA TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE COVERAGE IN THE WAY YOU ENVISION IT. WE M. WE AGREE THERE IS A TRANSITION PERIOD AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE ASKED DOCTOR PULL INTO THE. JILL DOWN AND EXAMINE THOSE ISSUES MORE SPECIFICALLY. TO FIGURE OUT. THAT THE COSTS AS HE'S DESCRIBE TODAY FROM THE JOB MAYBE THE OTHER COSTS AS WELL AND ALSO TIMELINE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE BILL DOES ENVISIONED NOT FULL IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL THAT AND FUNDS ARE CERTIFIED SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM. SO THAT'S THE TRIGGER WHERE WE. GO LIVE WITH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA'S THE FUNDS ARE SUFFICIENT THAT'S A DETERMINATION. ULTIMATELY MADE BY BY THE BOARD WITH WITH ADVICE. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE STAND WITH THE BILL LANGUAGE TODAY. WHAT WE? IT IS TRUE THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA FLIP A SWITCH AND HAVE GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT. THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD JUST WAIT FOR FEDERAL STATUTORY CHANGESIS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC ONE BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED STATUTORY CHANGES. THERE IS EXISTING STATUTORY LANGUAGE ABOUT STATE'S ABILITY TO ADMINISTER MEDICARE I KNOW YOU HAD EXPERTS TO. YOU KNOW THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY EXPERIMENTAL OR IN SOME RESPECTS BUT IT DOES EXIST IN STATUTE. DOCTOR POLAN TALKED ABOUT THE THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER PROVISIONS VERY BROAD VERY CLEAR THAT THAT THOSE FEDERAL MONIES CAN RE RE DIRECTED FROM SUBSIDIES TO TO FUNDING. AND YOU GOT ELEVEN FIFTEEN UNDER MEDICAID. WHICH IS EXTENT WE HAVE AN EXISTING CALIFORNIA WAIVER THE LAWYERS WE'VE TALKED TO WHO USED TO WORK FOR CMS BELIEVE WE CAN EXPAND THAT. SO WE'RE MORE OP WERE MORE. HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE AS SENATOR KEWELL HAS SAID WAYS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DEAL WITH AGAIN AND PROP NINETY EIGHT ISSUES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THAT WITH. YOUR STAFF OTHER OTHER POLICY LEGAL STAFF IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO OUR VIEW IS IS THAT. WE CAN EITHER SIT BY AND LET THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DETERMINE WHAT HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIANS GET BY NOT EVEN TRYING NOT EVEN TRYING TO GET WAIVERS NOT EVEN CALLING THEM ON. THEIR OPPOSITION TO. WAIVER IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL THE STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS. AND IF THEY DENY IT WE BELIEVE THERE'S A BASIS FOR LITIGATION. WE THINK IT'S WORTH A FIGHT AND. YEAH THAT'S A POLITICAL CHOICE. REALISTICALLY IF WERE ABLE IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OR THE SENATE THEN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES. DRAMATICALLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WE'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THIS WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN A HUNDRED FORTY PAGE BILL LIKE SP A. TEN. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL DYNAMIC REQUIRES US CERTAIN LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY LAY THE FOUNDATION SET THE BENEFITS SET THE FINANCING. SET THE POLICY FRAMEWORK AND FOUNDATION BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR THE PROGRAM BUT GIVE THE BOARD THE POWER TO RESPOND TO THE CHANGING FEDERAL CIRCUMSTANCE. A LONG WAY OF SAYING WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE TRANSITIONS GOING TO TAKE BUT WE KNOW IT'LL BE SHORTER THE SOONER WE START. SO I JUST KEPT JUST CLARIFY IN AND I'M AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I. WE HEARD THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW FOR MEDICAL MEDICARE TRUST FUND DO YOU. UNDERSTAND DO YOU DISAGREE WITH ACCESO LIKE YOU DO YEAH WE DO BUT THERE'S TWO THINGS TWO THINGS TO POINT OUT IN THE BILL ITSELF. WE WE'VE. THE PROVISION IS WE'RE GONNA PLAY FOR THESE WAIVERS WERE GOING TO INTEGRATE THE BENEFITS AND WE'RE GOING TO INTEGRATE THE MONIES. WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR A FEDERAL PROGRAM WHOSE IN CALIFORNIA APPLIES AND IN RULES IN THAT PROGRAM A. GETS THE BENEFITS FOR THAT PROGRAM. WE ALSO SPECIFY THAT WE WILL PAY THAT MADE AT THE PREMIUMS FOR PART B. COVERAGE AND WE WILL PAY. THE PART D. COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE. AM AND THE STUDY SHOWS WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT SO WE ARE EIGHT APPLY FOR THE WAIVER SIMPLY WE HAS A STATUTORY BASIS AND WILLIAM SHALL IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO POINTED THE WAY. TO THIS THESE PROCESSES RIGHT. AND THEN IF WE CAN'T GET THE WAIVERS WE HAVE A WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A PARALLEL STRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE THOSE. PAYMENTS AS MUCH AS FEASIBLE WITHOUT. WITHOUT NECESSARILY THE WAIVERS WE HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN. AND WE HAVE A PROCESS TO SEEK THE WAIVERS. LOOKING AT FINANCING. AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER. AND WE AS AROUND THE QUESTION OF RESERVES AND AND DO YOU DOCTOR POLLAND HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER A PRUDENT PERCENTAGE. OF RESERVES AND HOW MUCH ROUGHLY HOW MUCH MONEY IN RESERVE. WOULD WIN BE ABLE TO NEED TO HAVE. TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE GONNA HAPPEN IN. IN THE NATURAL UNNATURAL DOINGS OF OUR OUR ECONOMY CALIFORNIA YEAH. SO. LET'S SAY IN TODAY'S DOLLARS THE SYSTEM COST. ON AVERAGE AN AVERAGE YEAR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION. AND SO YOU KNOW IF IF WE JUST TAKE THAT METHODOLOGY THAT I BRIEFLY DESCRIBED BEFORE. WHICH SAYS YOU LOOK AT THE RANGE. AROUND THE AVERAGE. AND. THE THE REVENUE COMING IN. SO IF WE SAY THAT YOU KNOW. IN A VERY VERY GOOD YEAR. I SAID FOR FOREIGN HAVE PERCENT BUT LET'S SAY IT'S FIVE PERCENT. SO. THAT THAT WOULD MEAN. ANOTHER WE WOULD NEED ANOTHER FIFTEEN BILLION IN RESERVE TO COVER. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE GOOD YEAR UP FIVE PERCENT TO COVER THAT DID DOWN YEAR OF FIVE PERCENT SO WE WOULD NEED SOMETHING. IN THE RANGE OF FIFTEEN BILLION. WOULDN'T RELATIVE TO AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION SYSTEM. AND WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THAT COMING FROM SO. OVERTIME NOW LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR ONE I MENTIONED HERE ONCE OTHER WOULDN'T SO YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T PROPOSE HAVING. SORT CASH ON HAND YEAH I WOULD A AND HOW SO HOW MUCH YEAH HOW MY SO WE SO BASICALLY YOU KNOW LET'S TAKE A TEN YEAR PERIOD. THEN I'LL COME BACK TO YOU OKAY SO. IN YOU IT OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD IF WE BELIEVE. THAT LONG TERM TRENDS OUR ARE ARE SHOWING US SOMETHING SO SOME YEARS WE GO UP FIVE PERCENT SOME YEARS WE GO DOWN FIVE PERCENT AND WE NEED THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION PER YEAR ON AVERAGE. SO IN THE YEARS WHEN WE GET INSTEAD OF THREE THIRTY WE GET THREE FORTY FIVE BILLION OR LET'S SAY THREE FIFTY BILLION WE GRABBED THE TWENTY BILLION. THAT WE DON'T NEED TO FUND THE SYSTEM AND WE PUT IT IN RESERVE. AND THAT WOULD BE A NUFF TO COVER THE YEARS WHEN WE GO DOWN FROM THREE THIRTY TO THREE TEN AND REVENUE SO THAT'S THE LONG TERM FUNDING. THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATE NOW THAT DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT LET'S SAY WE START OUT IN YEAR ONE INSTEAD OF RAISING THREE THIRTY RIGHT AND YOUR TO. WEAR DOWN TO THREE TEN. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO FOUR YEAR ONE WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE. THIS TWENTY BILLION ADDITIONAL TWENTY BILLION IN RESERVE SO WE WOULD NEED TO EXPAND THE FIRST YEAR REVENUE TO COVER THAT BUT OVER TIME THE THIS SYSTEM FUNDS ITSELF BASED ON THE AVERAGE LEVEL. OF TAXES ARE FEE REVENUE. IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE GOOD YEARS YOU CAN'T LIKE SAY ALL GREAT NAY HERE WE HAVE EXTRA MONEY LET'S START SPENDING IT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT IN RESERVE. THEN I GUESS WHAT I AS I READ I READ YOUR STUDY MULTIPLE TIME THANK YOU AND. I'M SURE WAS GREAT REUNION. EACH TIME YOU PICK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT BUT IT LEFT ME WITH QUESTIONS AND AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS IT FEELS LIKE. AND AND I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH MENTION THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TWO POINT THREE PERCENT GROSS RECEIPTS TAX NOW THERE IS A TWO POINT THREE PERCENT SALES TAX RIGHT. WHICH IS WHICH IS OUT THERE AS WELL SO YEAH BUT THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT DIDN'T COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE REGRET WE TALKED IN DETAIL ABOUT GROSS RECEIPTS YEAH. SO THIS FEELS TIMMY MORE LIKE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. AND SO MY QUESTION IS. WE NO BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICANS TAX PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO HELP US ALL. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IS ALREADY BEING TALKED ABOUT IS A DECREASE IN MEDICARE A DECREASE IN MEDICAID. WE KNOW THAT. OVER TIME IN ADDITION TO YEAH I AT THIS SNAPSHOT IN TIME. COSTS IN EVERY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD WHETHER SINGLE PAYER NOT CONTINUE TO RISE. PERIOD. THERE ISN'T IT'S NOT STATIC AND MEAN. I GO TO THE I GO THE GROCERY STORE AND THINGS ARE MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE. SO BY ONE YOU KNOW I'M WONDERING. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN FACTORED IN THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN SHOWING. AN AMAZING EXPANSION IN OUR ECONOMY HERE THAT ISN'T GOING TO LAST FOREVER. SO. IF WE HAVE A DIP IN THE ECONOMY IF WE HAVE REDUCTION IN FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE HAVE INCREASED COSTS. WHERE DO WE GET I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT STATIC UP AND DOWN OF JUST WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE IS ENOUGH TO COVER THIS WHERE WE GET THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE? HOW DO WE DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SORT OF STRUGGLING WITH ANYA AND IN YOUR ANALYSIS? I'M SO YEAH THE THE EXACTLY IT'S A AYE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHAT OUR STUDY SHOWS BASICALLY IS A SNAPSHOT. AND A BUT WHAT WEEK IT'S EASY TO INCORPORATE. SO THE THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY. WILL GROW OVER TIME WIT WE WILL BY THE WAY WE WE WILL HAVE A RECESSION I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE A BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE RECESSIONS. WE HAVE NOT ABOLISHED RECESSIONS. SO THERE WILL BE A RECESSION AND REVENUE WILL GO DOWN. AND IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME AND IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES IT HAPPENS IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY THAT ALSO HAVE. THESE PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS SO YES YOU NEED A RESERVE FUND TO COVER THAT. OVERTIME ON AVERAGE THE U. S. ECONOMY ADVANCED ECONOMIES GROW. AND. THROUGH GROWTH WE WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE GROWTH IN THE POPULATION NOW YOU ALSO SAID COSTS WILL RISE. WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT COSTS WILL NOT RISE OVER? BECAUSE WILL A BE CONTROLLED. COSTS ARE RISING IN BY THE HUESO RIGHT NOW ON THE U. S. ECONOMY. WE'RE PAYING ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF GDP FOR HEALTH CARE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CMS PROJECTIONS. THEY SHOW IT GOING UP ARE YOU KNOW. WITH OBAMACARE IN WITH OF WHATEVER CONTROLS THEY HAD IN IT UP THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTENABLE THEY'RE TALKING IF YOU LOOK OF CMS PROJECTIONS. I INTEND YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING TWENTY PERCENT OF GDP. ON HEALTHCARE. ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE DOLLARS. AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE AT ROUGHLY HALF THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR CONNIE AND EQUIVALENT FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE MUST CONTROL COSTS AND AND I THINK THAT THE THIS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. AND SUGGESTED THROUGH A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WILL ENABLE VERY OF THERE'D BE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT COST CONTROLS IN THE AREA OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE AREA FARMER AND IN THE AREA OF OF REDUCING. WASTE THIS AREA THAT YOU KNOW THE. HA HA INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE HAS SAID. IS AT ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL SYSTEM COSTS RIGHT NOW. SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE TAX THAT DITCH Y.. NO NO NO NO NO NOT PERCENT NOT IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS YES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY GOES UP POPULATION BECAUSE OF. THAT AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY NO NO I THINK ILL GO DOWN. HOW IN FACT YOU KNOW WE THAT ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF OF OUR STUDY IS TO HAPPEN YOU NOT? A PUSHING DOWN COSTS MORE SO THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE CANADA OR FRANCE UNDER OUR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S SPENDING ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT OF STATE GDP ON HEALTHCARE. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL IS VERY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY MODEST REDUCTION WOULD BE AROUND. TWELVE FOR TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT WHEREAS YOU KNOW THE OTHER ADVANCED ECONOMIES ARE AT NINE TO ELEVEN PERCENT SO. ACTUALLYARE COST SAVINGS WHICH I THINK ARE TOTALLY VIABLE ARE FAIRLY MODEST. I GUESS AND I AND IF I GO BACK TO MY. IN THE EARLIER PART OF THAT IS THAT. WHEN I PREFACE THIS QUESTION WITH WITH. WE ALREADY KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REDUCE THE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID NO. THAT MEANS LESS MONEY YEAH THAT'S A LOWER NUMBER SO WHERE IS THE DIFFERENCE COME FROM HIM OVERTIME BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. IT'S LIKE TO BE A ONE SHOT DEAL I I PREDICT IT'LL BE IT IS IT IS LIKELY TO GO DOWN IN INCREMENTS OVER TIME. SO WHERE DOES THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE COME FROM. TO KEEP THE SYSTEM HOLE. RIGHT IS THAT IT IS ADDING ITSELF MEAN INCREASE SOMETIMES A SON NOW LET'S. NOW THESE OF. PUBLIC FUNDING CONSTITUTE SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL SPENDING. SO ITS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION. CAN OKAY SO IF IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW TAX CUTS. THAT WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION AND FEDERAL REVENUES FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OR MEDICARE HOW. OF YEAH THOSE WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPENSATED FOURTH THROUGH AN INCREASE IN STATE BUT NOTE THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OVERALL TAX OBLIGATIONS WOULD GO UP AND WE JUST MEAN. TAX CUTS. THAT WERE. PUT IN PLACE TO REDUCE FEDERAL REVENUE FOR MEDI CAL MEDICARE. WOULD THEN JUST BE COMPENSATED BY A AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE AND A STATE FUNDING. WHICH WOULD BE ADDITIONAL TAXES NO NOT NOT ON NET IT WOULD JUST BE. WHEN YOUR FEDERAL TAX. BILL GOES DOWN THEN THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO GO UP TO MATCH THE LOSSES OF FEDERAL REVENUE SO ON BALANCE IT WOULD BE NEUTRAL. AND. I CAN I JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW YOUR QUESTION I THINK UNDERSCORES THE COMPLEXITY OF. YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND. YOU KNOW EVEN BEYOND AND SB FIVE SIXTY TWO. YOU'RE ASKING AT LEAST YOU KNOW IN PART A TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT THEN ALSO A POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE THE PIE IT'S ONLY AS BIG AS THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THAT PIE. AND SO YES THERE'S AN UPSTREAM PART OF THAT BATTLE AS TO WHY WOULD WE BE CUTTING BACK ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. IF IN FACT WE HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE ON ADDRESSED YOU KNOW AND AND EVOLUTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT REALLY DEMANDS YOU KNOW MORE FUNDING FOR THOSE PARTICULAR PARTS OF OUR POPULATION THE ELDERLY AND ALSO THE. THE POOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE KNOWN FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. THAT WE DON'T INVEST ENOUGH IN PREVENTION NOW IN THIS COUNTRY. ANYONE WHO'S IN HEALTH CARE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE INSTEAD INVEST. WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND SICK CARE. AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR THE OUR LACK OF GOOD POLICY IN AND INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION SO THAT. THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY WE STILL NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT WHILE WE'RE DEALING WITH. ADVANCES SUCH AS SINGLE PAYER THAT'LL GIVE US NOT US MORE INVESTMENT AND AND BE ABLE TO A POLLING AND MORE DOLLARS IN ADDRESSING THE DOWNSTREAM BUT THEN ALSO PAYING ATTENTION TO THE UPSTREAM ISSUES AND WE JUST WE HAVE TO DO THAT. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEVEL OUT THE COST CURVE THEY HAVE THAT INVESTMENT IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND MANY OTHER AREAS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO. WE GOTTA KEEP THAT IN MIND THE CHAIRMAN WOULD IF I COULD QUICKLY. WE STILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN IF THEY HAPPEN. WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO WE HAVE TO RESPOND AS THE PRESENT SYSTEM WHERE SO MUCH MONEY IS DIVERTED TO WASTE INEFFICIENCY PROFITS MARKETING? IS THAT SYSTEM BETTER ABLE TO ABSORB THE CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR IS A SYSTEM WHERE CALIFORNIA'S DESIGNED OUR OWN. GUARANTEES HEALTHCARE IT'S UNDER OUR CONTROL SO I THINK YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO RELATE THOSE. POLITICALLY I DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT MEDICAID IS NEVER BEEN MORE POPULAR MEDICARE'S NEVER BEEN MORE POPULAR THERE WILL AYE AYE AYE AIR ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SUCCESSFULLY FOR. FIGHT THOSE CUTS AND EXPAND THOSE PROGRAMS THAT'S RIGHT THINK IT'S GOING TO GO. IN AND OUT HOW I JUST ONE MORE QUESTION AND I'M FIRST ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. AYE I'D. I DO TEND TO DIVE DEEP INTO THINGS AND SO THESE ARE THE THINGS TO KEEP ME AWAKE AT NIGHT WONDERING AND. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WHEN ONE OF THINGS WE HEARD HEARD AND SEEN WITH COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SINGLE PAYER. IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORKFORCE. SEVENTY PERCENT OF POSITIONS IN A SINGLE PAYER COUNTRIES ARE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. AND THIRTY PERCENT OF SPECIALISTS IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IN THE UNITED STATES. SO. AND ALSO IN SINGLE PAYER COUNTRIES A LOT OF THEM THEIR EDUCATION IS SUBSIDIZED IN SOME WAY BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH ALLOWS FOR IN IN SPITE OF WHAT. THEY DO HAVE LOWER SALARIES I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S EVERY INFORMATION WE HAVE SHOWS THAT HYSICIANS ANOTHER. IN SINGLE PAYER COUNTRIES MAKE LESS MONEY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION AND TAKING. IF THE TRANSITION IT TO GET. THE FLIP THAT SEVENTY PERCENT TO THIRTY PERCENT. HOW DO WE GET THERE? BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WE WON'T HAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIMARY CARE FORCE RIGHT NOW. ON THE BEST DAY AND I GET CONCERNED IN A ROW I REPRESENT A VERY RURAL DISTRICT WE CAN'T GET DOCTORS THERE NOW. WEEK WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT. WE HAVE TO FLY THEY HAVE TO FLY IN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS FOR ONE OF MY HOSPITALS IN. IN IN IN IN ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE COUNTIES IN IN THE STATE WHERE THE POOREST COUNTIES IN THE STATE. SO WHERE DID THE DOCTORS COME FROM AND AND HOW YOU KNOW IT AND YOU KNOW I SEE DOCTORS ASKING NODDING THEIR BECAUSE WE'VE HAD WE WE KIND OF HAD SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION. IT THIS IS SAY THIS IS A MONUMENTAL MONUMENTAL SHIFT IN THE WAY WE PRACTICE PRACTICE MEDICINE SO. THAT ISN'T AND I KNOW IT'S NOT CAN CONSIDER CONSIDERED AN FIVE SIX TWO SO MAYBE THIS IS JUST MORE A COMMENTARY BUT. BUT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE DOCTORS IN THE RIGHT PLACES NOW. IS SO A A SYSTEM THAT IS FOCUSED ON ANA UNSERVED A ONE SIZE FITS ALL DOESN'T WORK FOR ME IN MY RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME FOR THINGS PURCHASED OUR FAIR SHARE OF THINGS AND SO WRITTEN ONE SIZE AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKED ABOUT. CENTER KILLS APPROACH WAS. A REGIONAL APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE TO TO BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE DAY. EXTREMELY DIVERSE STATE SO THIS ONE SIZE ONE WHEN WAY FITS ALL. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK REAL WELL IN MY IN MY DISTRICT. WELL YEAH WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T. WE DEFINIR NOT CREATING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT IMAGINE IF IN THAT RURAL AREA THAT MEDI CAL RATES WENT UP TWENTY PERCENT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING THE MEDIC HOW RATES GOING UP TWENTY PERCENT HOW MANY MORE DOCTORS WOULD TAKE MEDI CAL WOULDN'T DAD IMPROVE THE SITUATION I AGREE THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE YOU'VE GOT. HUGE GRADUATE SCHOOL LOANS YOU GOT A SYSTEM THE PRIVILEGES SPECIALIST PAY. THAT HAS CREATED FEWER PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WE WORK WITH TO PHYSICIANS FOR NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM LIKE THE CAPITATA. THEY SEE THIS TOO AND THEY STILL SUPPORT THIS REFORM AS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESSING THESE PROBLEMS EXIST CURRENT SYSTEM NEW SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM IS BETTER ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM IN OUR VIEW IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BY ANY MEANS. AND IN FACT WE THINK THAT THAT THAT THE STRUCTURE OF IT ENABLES THE BOARD TO SET UP. ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY THE COULD ACHIEVE SOME OF THOSE SAME. OBJECTIVES THAT THE KILL BILL DID DIE I WOULD ALSO COURSE ONE HERE. DECISION. WELL MY DAUGHTER'S A GENERAL PAEDIATRICIAN DESPITE HER FATHER'S EXAMPLE. AND SHE GRADUATED WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO. THAT WE NEED TO YES IT'S ALL THIS IS VERY GOOD BUT YOUR QUESTION AND YOUR POINT IS IMPORTANT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WHAT CAN WE DO NOW. ONE OF THINGS THAT THE STATE COULD LOOK AT IS SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS. IS MAKING MEDICAL SCHOOL EDUCATION FREE. IF YOU GO TO PRIMARY CARE. AND YOU FOR EVERY YEAR THAT YOU THE STATE PAYS YOUR TUITION. YOU SERVE IN A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA RURAL URBAN WHATEVER. AND MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING KNOCK WOOD. IS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE INTO THE DRUG PROBLEM THE OP ó EIGHT EPIDEMIC THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE ALL A LOT OF THE ANSWERS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S ALIGNED WITH EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING THOSE ANSWERS AND SO IT IS WITH THE HEALTH WHAT FIRST YOU HAVE. A CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THAT IS OPERATING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. AND GENERATING A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT YOU DESCRIBE IN YOUR COUNTY. AND I CAN TELL YOU QUITE FRANKLY NUMBER ONE IT'S A PIPELINE ITS RECRUITMENT AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT COME FROM AREAS THAT ARE IN RURAL AREAS IF RECRUITED. IF PUT IN A PIPELINE PROGRAM EXPOSED TO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND THE DIGNITY ARE AND THE AMAZING GRATIFICATION FROM THE SERVICE. THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE AS A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER THAT PEOPLE DO WANT TO GO INTO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND THEY DO WANT TO GO SPECIFICALLY TO COME BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES MUCH MORE. SO THAN YOUR RECRUITING FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES ON A SUSTAINABLE SUSTAINABLE BASIS. AND WE NEED TO EXTEND. YEAH BEYOND PHYSICIANS THERE ARE REALLY HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND QUALIFIED NURSES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR. TEAM THAT DOES THE COMPREHENSIVE TYPE OF PRIMARY CARE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING NOW AYE GRAFTING ON THE ALMOST PROBABLY SPEAKING LIKE HERESY BECAUSE I'M A MEMBER OF THIS CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ABOUT BUT I'M BUT BUT SPEAKING VERY PRACTICALLY. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO EXTEND OUR PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE OTHERWISE THAT RATIO WILL CONTINUE TO PLAGUE US. WITH OVER UTILIZATION ON THE SPECIALTY SERVICES AND NOT ENOUGH FOR THE CARE THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED. NOT THE CAN BE PROVIDED IN A VERY EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW ROUTING IT BACK TO SINGLE PAYER A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WE'LL SEE A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES AND A LOT OF HOW THE HEALTH CARE WORK WORKFORCE NEEDS TO BE DEPLOYED AND HOW IT NEEDS TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY SPREAD AND HOW IT CAN ALSO. WORK AS A PARTNER YOU KNOW IN SYSTEMS. AND SYSTEMS CHANGE THAT WILL ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE NEEDS. RIGHT NOW NOT HOW CLOSE IN A DOCTOR WHAT DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND I HAVE BEEN. FIGHTING HARD FOR MORE HONEY FOR FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THAT BATTLE BUT IT IS IT IS REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE AND NOT JUST. NOT JUST FROM POSITIONS BUT FOR NURSES AND DENTISTS AND AND EVERYBODY THERE IT IS BUT IT IS A IT IS. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT IS A KEY IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF A ROBUST SUSTAINABLE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY MY POINT THERE. BUT BECAUSE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I DON'T THINK WE CAN TURN ON A DIME. SO. CAN BE RESPECTFUL AND APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR TIME AS WELL I'M GONNA TRY AND CAP US. FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES MORE OF QUESTIONS IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. AND THEN WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE SERGEANTS IF WE COULD GET MORE WATER APPEAR FOR THE PANELISTS AS WELL. I HAVE NEXT WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIP. THANK YOU DOCTOR KNOW WHEN I THINK THE THE PANELISTS AND AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS OUR CONVERSATION LET ME JUST STATE AT THE OUTSET I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED I WAS IN HERE EARLIER. I'VE ATTENDED EVERY HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THIS MORNING I HAD A LONG SCHEDULED. INTERVIEW WITH MY TODDLER HAS NOT YET TO WITH THE NURSERY SCHOOL. WHICH REFLECTS THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING INTO A NURSERY SCHOOL IN MY CITY. YEAH EXACTLY CITY HALL TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL DAYCARE NEXT. BUT I WANT FOLKS TO KNOW I DID SPEND TWO HOURS IN THE CAR LISTENING TO THE STREAMING INTERNET OF THIS HEARING AND I'VE GONE THROUGH ALL YOUR PRESENTE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. LET ME FIRST START BY BUILDING ON SOME THE QUESTIONS FROM DOCTOR WOULD AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH DOCTOR WOOD AND DUCT ARAMBULA AND OTHERS THAT. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE AND I AM A CO AUTHOR OF S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO I DO THINK. THAT WE OUGHT TO EXPAND THIS TO THINK ABOUT THAT ASPECT OF HOW WE ENSURE REALLY THE FUTURE OF OF WATER WORKFORCE NEEDS DEBATE. BOMB THERE WERE TWO POINTS THAT CAME UP IN YOUR DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR WHAT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A PRUDE SOME DISCUSSION AROUND THE IDEA THAT. THERE'S NOT AN EXPECTATION OF A HUGE LOSS OF JOBS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. ARM AND AND AND AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT JOBS WOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. BUT JUST ONE CLEAR MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOUR CONTENTION IS THAT JOBS ARE NOT GOING TO GO DOWN THEY MAY GO DOWN IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. BUT OVERALL THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE ECONOMIC. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY RELATED HEALTH CARE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING TO GO DOWN DRAMATICALLY IS THAT IS AT THE POINT THAT I THINK I'LL TRY TO MAKE. WELL I KNOW I DON'T YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE ANY REDUCTION IN. EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN PROVIDING CARE. THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO GO UP BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL HAVE MORE ACCESS TO CARE. AND AND. OFFICES WILL BE ABLE TO SPEND LESS TIME. ON ADMINISTRATION AND MORE TIME ON CARE. BUT THERE WILL BE JOB LOSSES IN THE AREA OF ADMINISTRATION AND THAT'S WHY WE FOCUS ON. HOW DO? PROVIDED JUST TRANSITION FOR THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY WILL EXPERIENCE JOB LOSSES THROUGH THE CONTRACTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY THANK YOU PROFESSOR POLLEN BECAUSE WE'VE ALL READ YOUR ANALYSIS I'VE BEEN SIGNING YOUR STUDY AND. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST NOTE IF I HAVE NOT REALLY HEARD MUCH BY WAY OF REFUTATION OF YOUR STUDY AND IF THEIR FOLKS TO. HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE I IN TO BE GOOD TO HEAR BUT I WANNA JUST THANK YOU FOR. FOR YOUR ANALYSIS AND A DOCTOR WOULD ALLUDED TO THAT TRUMP TAX LAW THAT JUST WENT INTO EFFECT. AND THIS IS A PLAN AS WE ALL KNOW THAT PROVIDES MASSIVE TAX BREAKS FOR CORPORATIONS IN THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS. URINALYSIS OF THE TYPES OF TAX POLICIES YOU PROPOSE TO CALIFORNIA ARE OBVIOUSLY BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS AND PAYROLL AND SALES TAX BUT YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE WERE TO RAISE TAXES IN THOSE VERY AREAS WHERE THINGS WERE CUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WHICH I THINK WOULD PROBABLY BRING IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBVIATE THE NEED EVEN FOR SALES TAX AS YOU PROPOSED IT IS EVEN LOOKED EVEN LOOKED AT THE IMPACT OF TRUMP TAX. PROVISIONS ON WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WE COULD CONSIDER HERE IN THE SNOW CALIFORNIA I HAVEN'T BUT AS WE KNOW THAT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE OF THE. TRUMP TAX CUTS ARE CORPORATIONS. SO. HAVING THE CORPORATIONS PAY LESS AND FEDERAL TAXES WEALTH AND THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO. INCREASE WHATEVER OBLIGATIONS THEY WOULD HAVE UNDER THIS PROVISION. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT PROFESSOR THAT'S THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE AS WELL THAT CORPORATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE SEEN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CUTS. IF WE WERE ASSN TO GO BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY CHARGING YOU SALES TAX TO PAY FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RIGHT YEAH RIGHT I MEAN THE AND ALSO THOUGH YES SO THAT THE AND AGAIN IT YOU KNOW. MY JOB IS NOT TO DECIDE HOW. WERE RAISES REVENUES TO GIVE YOU ALL OPTIONS. AND SO THE WAY THAT WE DESIGNED BOTH. THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX AND THE PAYROLL TAX. WAS TO LOAD IT DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BIG CORPORATION. AND YOU KNOW UP AS WE DESIGNED BOTH THE PAYROLL TAX AND THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX A SET EIGHTY PERCENT OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE'LL PAY NO TAXES. NOW A THE OTHER ONES YA THEY'LL PAY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT GROSS RECEIPTS TAX BUT AS YOU SAID THAT IS BASICALLY MATCHING UP AGAINST THE TAX CUT. THAT TRUMP JUST GAVE THEM. SO YEAH ON BALANCE THERE THEY'RE COMING OUT EVEN. AND IN THIS IS CERTAINLY CONVERSATION INTERESTED AND THEN WITHOUT PUTTING MY COLLEAGUE IS THE CHAIR OF THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE ON THE SPOT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUATION THIS CONVERSATION HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION TO A DRUG PURCHASES. THERE WAS A SLIDE IN THE PRESENTATION ON S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. SUGGESTING WE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE STARK ESTATE DRUG PURCHASING AND AND I THINK A NUMBER OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE THOSE EFFORTS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE HAVE HAD NOW TO YOUR BILL US. AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE OVER DOZEN SIT STATE AGENCIES THAT PURCHASE DRUGS TO ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE AT THIS POINT THEY DON'T SHARE INFORMATION. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER'S RESPECTIVE PRICING IS THEY DON'T NEGOTIATE COLLECTIVELY. AND AND THAT BILL. HAS GOTTEN THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT IT IS STALLED IN THE FINAL SENATE COMMITTEE BUT THAT BEING SAID SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS ON YOUR PART. YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE CONSOLIDATE THE BUYING POWER NOT JUST OF STATE AGENCIES BUT LOCAL CONSUMER AND PATIENT STATUS AT. IS THAT RIGHT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S FAIR I MEAN I THINK WHAT I SUGGEST IN THE STUDY WERE TWO MODELS. ONE A DOMESTIC MODEL THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND TO. CANADA IN TERMS OF THEIR HAVING FORMULARIES AND A AND USING THEIR BARGAINING POWER TO LOWER DRUG PRICES THEY'RE QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN FACT THE NUMBER THAT. WE HAVE IN OUR STUDY OF A THIRTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS IS EXTREMELY MODEST. YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER COUNTRIES HERE FORTY FIFTY PERCENT. THIS SPENDING LESS. THROUGH USING. THEIR BARGAINING POWER SO IT THAT IS A. HUGE AREA FOR SAVINGS AND IT'S AND IT'S PROVEN TO WORK AND EVERY SINGLE SETTING THAT ITS USE. SO I I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY AND I I'M GLAD T HEAR ABOUT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW BUT. IT CERTAINLY IS A VERY PROMISING AREA ENDS WITHIN. S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO THAT WOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL BENEFIT THAT WOULD BE GAINED ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD LOVE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE MY OFFICE WITH SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT SUBJECT SO WE CAN THINK FURTHER ABOUT IT. UP I'D LIKE TO ASK THE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF IF YOU COULD REFERENCE A COUPLE OF SLIDES IN THE PRESENTATION WHICH REALLY JUMPED AT ME AND I HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE CONTENTION OF. THE DENIAL OF OF CARE BY BY HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES SO I'D ACTUALLY NOT SEEN THIS ANALYSIS BEFORE THAT SUGGESTED THAT. ARE IN THE TIME FRAME OF TWO THOUSAND NINE TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. A QUARTER OF ALL CLAIMS. HAD BEEN REJECTED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE THE IT YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILLION CLAIMS THIRTEEN MILLION CLAIMS ARE TALKING ONE OUT OF THREE. CALIFORNIANS ARE ONE AYE IT'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER AND AND AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NO LONGER. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. IT CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT WEISS INFORMATION UP PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. WELL. OUR VIEW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS BECAUSE THE STUDY CAME OUT AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DIDN'T WANT THE DATA AVAILABLE ANYMORE SO TO SPEAK THE STATE AGENCY NO LONGER PROVIDES IT THAT'S WHAT OUR RESEARCHERS. CAME UP WITH WHEN THEY INVESTIGATED IT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE USE THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW IS KIND OF A PROXY. BUT THAT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED THE THE INDUSTRY SHUT IT DOWN. OKAY. IT'S NOT STATE LAW. THAT WE. GET THIS INFORMATION IS NOT STATE LAW THAT THIS INFORMATION BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. IF WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. SO SO IF I READ THIS CORRECTLY YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT MILLIONS OF CLAIMS WERE. WERE DENIED AND OF THAT ONLY FORTY PERCENT WERE APPEALED SO IN OTHER WORDS EITHER. THAT YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER SIXTY PERCENT AND A PERCENTAGE WAS REVERSED THE DECISION BY THE PLANES REVERSED OR. NOT THE PILLS WERE RETURNED AND MY GETTING THAT RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT AND KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERY BEFORE YOU GET INTO HIM IN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE COMPANIES AND. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE. THAT IS A THIRTY DAY MINIMUM PROCEDURE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY. MOST OF THE MONETARY AWARDS AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAT ARE GIVEN ARE BECAUSE OF HOW THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE HAS FAILED PATIENTS SO THIS IS THE SECOND STEP. FIRST WE GOT TO GET TO THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE WHICH IS WHY WE SAY IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS GO THROUGH THAT GAUNTLET. STILL GO TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW AND STILL SIXTY PERCENT. ARE OVERTURNED ESSENTIALLY. IN THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY PAYMENT TONIGHT FOR MERCY URGENT CARE. AND THEN IF YOU COULD JUST FLIP THROUGH THE NEXT FEW SLIDES I KNOW THIS THIS IS ABOUT INDUSTRY. PROFITS AND. AND WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING AND THEN TO THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG POINT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS MOMENT. WHAT DENIALS OR WHAT WHAT WHAT TO CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE THAT WHEN THEY'RE DENIED UP A PATIENT DECIDES NOT APPEAL CARESSED DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T KNOW GIVING ESTIMATE? UP YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T ACTUALLY. HAVE AN ESTIMATE OKAY SO THE POINT I'M ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE HERE IS I'D LIKE TO ASK THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THESE LAST FEW SLIDES IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK FOR US TO KNOW. ABOUT THIS DATA AND WHETHER THIS I'M ASSUMING THIS INFORMATION IS TRUE. AND I'D I WOULD LOVE TO TO GET SOME VERIFICATION ON THAT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. THE RESEARCHERS WHO DID THIS PROJECT WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL A MATERIAL THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THEIR WORK WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THIS OKAY. SOME AND THEN RELATED TO THIS I KNOW I'VE HEARD AT LEAST EVERY DEMOCRAT ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE BECAUSE I AB I JUST HADN'T HEARD THIS. WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING A STATEMENT YOU WOULD BELIEVE IN BUT I THINK EVERY DEMOCRAT ON THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT. THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN SHOULD HAVE AN AXE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE I'M AND THAT HEALTHCARE SHOULD JUST GO TO THOSE WHO CAN PAY OR THOSE WHO CAN PAY A LOT OF THOSE WHO. DON'T GET A CERTAIN TYPE OF ILLNESS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF THAT'S THE CASE WHEN WE HAVE STATUS QUO SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR MILLIONS OF DENIALS. IT SEEMS TO CUT UP AGAINST THAT IDEA THAT HEALTHCARE OUGHT TO BE A RIGHTS. YES EXACTLY RIGHT EXACTLY RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOU CAN HAVE HEALTH CARE'S HUMAN RIGHT IF YOU CONDITION IT. WHERE CAN BE DENIED WHERE FINANCIAL BEARS CAN PREVENT CARE THAT'S NOT A HUMAN RIGHT? THAT'S A THAT'S A SOME WE BUY AND SELL AND WE ONLY CAN DO SO IF WE HAVE THE MONEY. DIFFERENT CONVERSATION I KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED THAT MUCH TODAY ABOUT THE RATES OF UNDER INSURED FOLKS BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF THE ACA HAS BEEN GREAT IN ENSURING MILLIONS OF MORE CALIFORNIANS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE SEEN. NO IS A CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE FROM THAT HEALTH INSURANCE IS IS NOT IT ENOUGH. AND A PROFESSOR PAUL AND OR OTHERS AND WONDERED IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF THE UNDER INSURED. YES THANK YOU LIKE. ALMOST ALL OF THE ISSUES BABY ALL THE ISSUES IN OUR STUDY I I'M NOT AN EXPERT I'M RELYING ON A LOT OF THEIR OUTSTANDING RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE. AND SO I HAVE. THIS STUDY. HOW WELL THIS INSURANCE COVERAGE PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM HEALTHCARE COSTS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH FUND? AND SO I I QUOTED THOSE. THERE. DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MEASURE UNDER INSURANCE. SO. THAT THE ONE THAT WE WERE. USING AS OUR MEASURE OF UNDER INSURANCE WAS THE ONE IN WHICH WE SAY. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE AT INSURANCE. THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. DID NOT FILL A PRESCRIPTION SKIP TO RECOMMEND A TEST TREATMENT OR FOLLOW UP HAD A MEDICAL PROBLEM DID NOT VISIT A DOCTOR CLINIC OR DID NOT GET SPECIALIST CARE. THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THE SURVEY. DID. WE'RE FACED WITH ONE OF THOSE FOR ACCESS PROBLEMS WITH HAVING INSURANCE THAT'S ONE MEASURE AND JUST BRIEFLY THEY HAVE OTHER MEASURES. THAT UP PEOPLE FACING. MEDICAL. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OUR MEDICAL DEBT. WITH HAVING INSURANCE. OF PEOPLE RECEIVED A LOWER CREDIT RATING THIRTY NINE PERCENT. USED UP ALL THEIR SAVINGS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT TOOK ON CREDIT CARD DEBT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT UNABLE TO PAY FOR BASIC NECESSITIES DUE TO THE HEALTHCARE COSTS. FOOD HEAT OR RENT TWENTY THREE PERCENT. DELAYED EDUCATION OR CAREER PLANS TWENTY PERCENT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM IT IS NOT JUST THE ISSUE OF. UNINSURED IT'S THE IT THESE ISSUES OF UNDER INSURED AND WHEN I SAID AT THE OUTSET WHEN YOU WERE LISTENING ON THE RADIO OR AT YOUR MEETING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. OF. THE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S STUDY I SAID I AGREED WITH ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT. THE THIRTY PERCENT THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH UNFORTUNATELY IS IMPORTANT AND AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT THEY DON'T COVER THE ISSUE OF POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. AND THE SECOND IS A DONE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF UNDER IN. HAVE YOU WRITTEN ON THAT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT ANALYSIS BECAUSE I'VE READ THE WE'VE ALL READ THE ONLY. ANALYSIS IN THERE ARE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS AND IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET YOUR ASPECT YEAH. OKAY NAM I DO KNOW WE'RE COMING UP AGAINST UNLESS SOMEONE HURT YOU MAY I JUST ANSWER JUST ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS EARLIER WHERE WE GOT THE DATA FROM AYE ON THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW IS FROM THE D. MHC FINANCIAL FILINGS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THAT'S THE SOURCE OF THAT AND SOLICIT AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER TWO THOUSAND NINE FAMILIES FINANCED FILENE'S THAT THEY'VE MADE WITH THE INMATES SEE INCLUDE THE I AM OUR INFORMATION. NOT THE CLAIMS NINE SOME INFORMATION GOT THAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THE ANALYSIS WAS THOSE DMA SEE VIOLENCE BY THE INSURERS OKAY. OKAY AND I AM THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO I JUST TO MAKE IT JUST TO BRING IT HOME AGAIN ON A ON A VERY HUMAN LEVEL. SO IN MY PRACTICE YOU KNOW I HAVE A TWO EXAMPLES OF ELDERLY PATIENTS WHO ARE COVERAGE THEY HAVE MEDICARE AND. ONE OF THEM HAS MEDICAID AS WELL. WALKER YOU KNOW IT NEEDS A WALKER AND HAD TO END UP PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY DOLLARS. FOR THE COMPLETE TO COMPLETE THE COST OF THE WATER AND IS. OPERATING MORE USING A CANE AND NO WALKER BECAUSE SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE AS THAT THE INSURANCE YOU KNOW. GOVERNMENT INSURANCE YOU KNOW SHOULD STILL BE A YOU KNOW A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD. BUT IS UNDER INSURED IN THAT REGARD ANOTHER PATIENT WHO HAS DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION AND EVERY TIME I WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR HIM. ASKED ME HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST BECAUSE HE HAS A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE. AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD THAT MEDICATION ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOME UNDER INSURANCE AND SO IT'S REAL. IT'S HUMAN YOU KNOW BEYOND THE NUMBERS WHICH YOU NEED RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF PROJECTIONS ON HOW IT IS THAT WE CAN. BOLSTER OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE. IT'S A IT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH UNDER INSURANCE. THANK YOU AYE AYE I DO UNDERSTAND I'M BUMPING UP AGAINST ONE O'CLOCK OUR TIME FRAME THAT. OR CHAIR HAD WANTED US TO. TO RESPECT LET ME LET ME JUST CLOSE WITH THE FOLLOWING A. I'VE BEEN A LONG TIME SUPPORTER THE ACA AND I AND WE ALL KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES ARE TRYING TO RIP APART THE ACA. BUT I ALSO THINK THE ACA HAS NOT BEEN. WHAT WE WANTED IT TO BE AND AS AS YOU'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST FEW MINUTES AROUND OUR UNDER INSURANCE RATES AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE MILLIONS WHO ARE UNINSURED? AND AND SO THIS IS IN PART WHY I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE VISION OF SINGLE PAYER. AND I. WANTED TO BE ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO SORT OF TEST THAT HYPOTHESIS AND AND. I I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS FOR MANY HEARINGS OF IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT IMPACT. WHAT WE ARE TO DO WITH AND FOR BUT I WILL SAY FUNDAMENTALLY MY PROSPECTIVE STILL REMAINS THE SAME WE NEED SIGNIFICANT REFORM? I AND I THINK THE VISION A SINGLE PAYER STILL MAKE SENSE THAT BEING SAID CLEARLY WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF DETAILS THAT WE STING STILL NEED TO DELVE INTO. DETAILS. EITHER WITHIN. THIS BILL THAT. IS BEING CONSIDERED OR OTHERS OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO GIVEN THE REALITY OF DONALD TRUMP OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. HOW DO WE SET UP THE ROADMAP? HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT COST CONTROL HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT TRANSITIONS HOW WE THINK ABOUT REVENUES A LOT OF QUESTIONS? BUT FOR ME THOSE THE FACT THAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE OUT THERE IS NOT A REASON FOR US TO TO NOT ENGAGE INTENSELY IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT FIGURE OUT. RIGHT NOW AND AND TWO BECAUSE THE URGENCY OF NOW WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING. BECAUSE OF LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS AS REAL TODAY AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I LOOK FOR TO MANY OTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND AS I'VE BEEN SAYING TO EVERY STAKEHOLDER. AND INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION FROM EVERY PART OF THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR WE NEED SOLUTIONS AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW AND SO I'M ASKING FOLKS AND I THINK WE'RE ALL ASKING FOLKS. GIVE US YOUR BEST IDEAS NOW. WERE OBVIOUSLY HAVING THAT CONVERSATION TODAY WITH. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO AND OTHER PROPOSALS BUT NOT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT. THANK YOU. IN RESPECT OF THIS PANEL BOMB I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE QUESTION JUST TO. REALLY. TRY AND LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERTISE. DOCTOR PAUL IN IN YOUR PERRY REPORT ON PAGE THREE YOU SAID THAT WE WOULD NEED A HUNDRED AND SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. STATE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO REACH. THE GOALS OF SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO. BUT WITHIN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS THE AUTHOR'S OWN COMMITTEE. THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED BILLION THAT THEY. SAID WOULD NEED TO BE RAISED AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN HELP TO RECTIFY THE DIFFERENCES AND DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THOSE TWO FIGURES. AND WATCH ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE WITHIN YOUR STUDY VERSUS WHAT WAS DONE ON THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS. I'M. SO A. OF OF OF FOR ONE THING AT THE AS I SAID I I DO LIKE. MANY THINGS ABOUT THEIR STUDY AND AND AND AND AGAIN WHAT ONE OF MY FORMER STUDENTS IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS. BUT UP AT THE FACT IS THEY DON'T FULLY DOCUMENT. WHERE THEY GOT THEIR RESULTS WHICH I THINK I THINK WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT OUR STUDY DOES? CAREFULLY DOCUMENT SO IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO KNOW IN FULL. IN GENERAL THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE NOT INCORPORATING POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. WHEREAS WE ARE SO WE WE AGREE. TO COVER EVERYBODY. UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM. WOULD COST FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WE'RE IN TOTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON THAT. BUT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE CAN GET COSTS DOWN FROM FOUR HUNDRED BILLION TO THREE THIRTY BILLION THROUGH THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF SAVINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED. THEY DON'T A ENGAGE ON THAT QUESTION NOT VERY BRIEFLY I MEAN THEY DO HAVE A BRIEF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING FOR EXAMPLE DRUG FORMULARIES BUT THEY SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. UNDER H. P. FIVE SIX TWO WHEREAS IN MY OPINION IT'S A EXTREMELY VIABLE. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE THEY DO NOT ENGAGE ON THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. I AM SO I I WOULD LIKE IT IF THEY HAD DOCUMENTED MORE FULLY WHY THEY DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO DOWN FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO SAY THREE THIRTY OR THEREABOUTS. THAT'S WHAT MY. MY SENSE OF IT OUT A BUT AS I SAID WE WE DO GO THROUGH IT AND AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALL READING AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY ACTUALLY WOULD READ OF ACTUAL THINGS. BUT. YEAH I'M HERE OF MY STUDENTS NEVER READ WHAT I TELL HUNDRED SO. THE I YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY HOW WE GET FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO THREE THIRTY IT'S RIGHT THERE AND I WOULD WELCOME. MY FORMER STUDENT ROBERT ENGINEERED A FEAR HERE ARE LISTENING. TELL ME WHERE I WENT WRONG IF SOMEBODY HAS A GOOD CRITICISM I'M OPEN TO IT. I I THINK IT'S I THINK THEY'RE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE OF ITS IT CAN FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. SO I'M WILLING TO STAND BY. DON'T FOLLOW UP THE CORE. REALLY. YOU DON'T MUCH LIKE WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER ARE THOSE SAVINGS ACHIEVABLE DAY ONE. ARE THOSE SAVINGS THAT WOULD YOU KNOW CHANGE OVER TIME. AND REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS. HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT TRANSITIONS OR IMPLEMENTATION YET NOT AND THAT NOTHING HAPPENS AND DAY ONE WE S. AS EVERYONE IS THAT WE DO NOT FLIP SWITCH? AND ALL THE SUDDEN WE GOT THIS WONDERFUL SYSTEM THAT WORKS PERFECTLY NO THERE HAVE TO BE. A A TRANSITION PERIOD I ON THE OTHER HAND SO. IN THIS EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE ON THIS ISSUE AROUND THE THE COST SAVINGS FROM. IMPROVE. SERVICE PROVISION. AS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'M ASSUMING FIVE PERCENT SAVINGS IN THAT AREA WHERE AS THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE SAID IT'S SHOULD BE NINETEEN PERCENT. SO WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK IS THAT. WE START IN THE RANGE OF THREE FOUR FIVE PERCENT IN YEAR ONE AND I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE FROM WHAT MY READING OF THE LITERATURE. BUT I THINK WE CAN IT IF THERE ISN'T REALLY TWENTY PERCENT OR MORE WASTE OUT THERE. OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE OR ROUGHLY A DECADE WE CAN GET CLOSER TO TWENTY PERCENT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THAT THE. A CM ES PROJECTIONS. FOR RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS YOU KNOW THE CURVE CONTINUALLY TO GO UP. I THINK THAT IS THE MAJOR WAY THROUGH WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE CURVE TO GO DOWN RECOGNIZING. THAT THERE IS THE TREMENDOUS WASTE IN THE SYSTEM WE WILL NOT GET AT IT ALL IN YEAR ONE MAYBE WE CAN GET TO FIVE PERCENT IN YEAR ONE OR TWO. BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE THROUGH A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM AND. MUCH MORE CAREFUL MONITORING WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MORE SAVINGS SO THAT'S WHY I THINK. MY ESTIMATE OF THE EIGHTEEN PERCENT. SAVINGS IS PROBABLY PRETTY CONSERVATIVE. WHAT THAT IF I CAN I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR YOUR ENDURANCE? ABILITY TO ANSWER THESE. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK WITH THIS COMMITTEE NOW UNTIL TWO PM I WOULD ASK THOSE WHO ARE. IN THE AUDIENCE NOW. TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE AND TO COME BACK WHEN WE BEGIN TO GET A TO. LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU THERE OKAY WE'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THE NEXT. PART OF OUR HEARING. SO WE'RE GOING INVITE UP OUR SECOND PANEL. ANTHONY RIGHT PETER FAN. AND JOHN ARSON MEYER. OUR INSPIRE EXCUSE ME. SORRY. AND YOU NEED SLIDES ON. RIGHT THERE OKAY SO WHAT WOULD GO AHEAD IT WILL HELP GO AHEAD GET STARTED HERE I'M. OUR FIRST FIRST TO SPEAKERS THIS AFTERNOON ANTHONY WRIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PUT. OF. HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA. BETSY ESTUDIO. THINKS SENIOR POLICY MANAGER. HEALTH BENEFITS CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. PETER FAN OF THE TREASURE PRINCIPLE OFFICER TEAMSTERS LOCAL EIGHT FIFTY SIX SARAH FLOCKS. NO STRANGER TO US HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. POLICY COORDINATOR FOR THE. TEMPERING LABOR FEDERATION AND JOHN JOHN EARNS MEYER FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY SO MISTER RIGHT YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. I OFTEN. LET ME TRY TO GET. OKAY. AGAIN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA. I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS ANTHONY RIGHT AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. HEALTH ACCESS IS THE STATEWIDE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WORKING FOR THE GOAL OF QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. FOR THIRTY YEARS WE BURKE BOTH ON THE VISION OF A OF A UNIVERSAL HEALTH HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGET BATTLES OF THE MOMENT ON THE CAPITOL AS YOU YOU KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WORKING. TO REPRESENT THE PATIENCE IN THE PUBLIC SOMETIMES AS A COUNTERPOINT TO INSURERS ARE DOCTORS ARE DRUG COMPANIES OR. HOSPITALS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. A AND WE'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO BALANCE THAT WITH PUTTING FORWARD THE VISION OF HOW DO WE GET TO SET UP A SYSTEM THAT IS TRULY UNIVERSAL BOTH IN CARE AND COVERAGE IN PROTECTING PEOPLE SO THAT WE. DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED WHO LIVE SICKER WHO DIE YOUNGER AND WHO ARE ONE EMERGENCY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN WEEK YOU KNOW WE CARE ABOUT THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO CARE. BUT ALSO THAT THERE FINANCIALLY PROTECTED FROM. IT MEDICAL BANKRUPTCY OR SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL BILLS WE'VE APPROPRIATE IN WORKING WITH THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ON A RANGE OF ISSUES WHAT WHETHER IT'S BEEN ON. THE LEADERSHIP TO YOU THAT. THAT THE FOLKS IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE WORKED ON TO. BANNED THE PRACTICE OF SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS WHETHER TO ADDRESS HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WHETHER TO WORK ON TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE TO UNFAIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND IT AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW CONVERSATION ABOUT TAKING ADDITIONAL ARE STEPS FORWARD. I TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WE JUST OF PAID A LITTLE BIT OF BASELINE OF WHERE WE ARE OBVIOUSLY. OF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PRO OF PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS DONE NOT JUST TO IMPLEMENT THE TO IMPROVE UPON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS A RESULT OF THAT THAT WORK TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS NEW FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF WITH REGARD TO GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED FOR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE NEW COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THAT AND WE'VE SEEN THE BIGGEST DROP OF THE UNINSURED WRITTEN RATE OF ALL FIFTY STATES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE I WAS WE WERE AT AS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT UNINSURED ARE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO NOW THE CDC HAS THIS IS BACK BELOW SEVEN PERCENT. I'D IT WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN PROACTIVE ACTIONS AND I'M NOT JUST TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE FEDERAL LAW BUT TO GO FORWARD TO HAVE A. OF FOR EXAMPLE ANY AN EXCHANGE THAT NEGOTIATE FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE. A STANDARDIZED OF A BENEFITS TO PROVIDE WAYS TO GET PEOPLE QUICKLY AND EASILY INTO COVERAGE TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO NEW OF POPULATIONS AS WELL. AND SO THE QUESTION I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOOD GRAPPLING WITH IS IF WE CAN PREVENT THE ATTACKS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE SEEING. THROUGH EIGHT AC REPEAL INSTEAD MEDICAID CUTS HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY GO FORWARD. THOUGH I'D JUST ON A MOMENT ABOUT THOSE ATTACKS THAT YOU KNOW THE PROPOSALS THAT WE STATE FACED LAST YEAR. IN A IN CONGRESS WORST SIGNIFICANT IT HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW MUCH. DEVASTATION THEY WOULD HAVE RACKED ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON HOW MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE HANDCUFFED OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER. OR EVEN TAKE STEPS FORWARD DAY WE DID THEY WHAT THEY PROPOSE MASSIVE CUTS TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CUTTING IN CAPPING THE MEDICAID PROGRAM LEAVING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS MORE UNINSURED FOR. GIBT JUST FOUR MILLION MORE FROM GET GETTING RID OF THE MEDICAID EXPANSION MILLIONS MORE IF YOU. IF THE PROPOSAL ALSO. AND DID SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND COVERED CALIFORNIA OR AYE AND DID OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE PROPOSALS. AND UNDO SOME OF THE KEY PATIENT PROTECTIONS THAT. THAT. THAT WERE PROPOSED. WE DEREK DEATH DEATH THREAT VERY MUCH DOES CONTINUE WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THE BUDGET RESOLUTION THAT THIS CONGRESS PASSED LAST YEAR. DE OUTLINED ACTUALLY MEDICAID TYPE IT'S THAT WERE TWICE AS SEVERE AS THE ECA REPEAL BILL YOU CAN SEE THAT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE CAP THAT. IS BEING PROPOSED A PROPOSED AT THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS A YOU WOULD HAVE A MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PROVIDING HALF AS MUCH DOLLARS TO SEE EYE TO STATES. THAT IS A SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MONEY OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS MONEY THAT WE WE NEED TO. TO COVER OUR THIS POPULATION WHICH NOW CUT IS ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS A THIRD OF THE STATE HALF OF ALL CHILDREN TWO THIRDS OF ALL NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. AND THIS IS. AND SO TO IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THAT IF IF THIS HAPPENED THIS WOULD NOT JUST BE LESS MONEY FOR THE TO EVEN MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING SYSTEM OR TO FIND ANY OTHER SYSTEM WHETHER BE SINGLE PAYER ANY OTHER SYSTEM. SO OUR FIRST GOAL AND OUR FIRST FOCUS OF LAST YEAR WAS TO TRY TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL NAKED AND WE NEED TO HAVE CONTINUED VIGILANCE WITH REGARD TO. OF WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED IN DC. IF WE CAN HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN THE FINANCING OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INTACT HOWEVER THERE ARE THINGS CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO IT TO RESIST SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR HEHE ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY THE FIFTH BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE WHO WE'VE OUTLINED AT LEAST SIX OR SEVEN DIFFERENT WAYS WHERE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE OUR MARKETS DESTABILIZE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND UNDO THE ODE TO A. THAT THEY DE FUND THE COST SHARING REDUCTION. THEY CUT MARKETING BY NINETY PERCENT WE INCREASED OUR MARKETING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ENROLLED IN TODAY WE ACTUALLY HAVE NEW NUMBERS FROM COVER CALIFORNIA THAT SUGGEST THAT IN ROME AND ACTUALLY WENT UP BY THREE PERCENT DESPITE ALL THE FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY. AND AND ISSUES AND SO OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW IN A NEW PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR COVERAGE IN THE LAST OPEN ENROLLMENT. THEY SOUGHT TO CUT THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD BY THREE MONTHS WE ARE A BIT FROM THREE MONTHS TO SIX WEEKS WE MAINTAIN A THAT THREE MONTH OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD AND I DO SO INTO THE FUTURE. WITH A WITH A BILL BY A CHAIRMAN WHAT. WE OWE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT AS INSURERS WERE EXITING THAT CONSUMERS. TO CONTINUE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY SAW TO IT AND UNDERMINE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE WE ACTUALLY HAD PRE EXISTING. LAWS IN PLACE TO I TRY TO AT LEAST MAKE FOR CALIFORNIA REGULATED PLAN HAD THAT PROTECTION. BUT THERE IS MORE TO DO TO PREVENT. DID. THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THESE ARE AYE AND I ATTACKS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THE PREMIUM SPIKES AND THE PROJECTIONS OF. OUR INCREASED IN TERMS OF MORE UNINSURED MORE UNDER INSURED. MORE JUNK COVERAGE ACCEPTANCE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DID WAS TO TRY TO PROMOTE. GUY JUNKER SUBSTANDARD COVERAGE COVERAGE THAT DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE ACA ARE OFTEN CALLED ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS. ARE A OR SHORT OUR ALSO SHORT TERM INSURANCE. WHERE WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THOSE ESOS ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLAN REGULATIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED? AND ON SHORT TERM INSURANCE WE'RE PROUD TO BE WORKING ON A BILL I ON THE BILL WITH TENDER HERNANDEZ ON. BANNING THAT OUT RIGHT EYES SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE SUB STANDARD COVERAGE THAT LEADS PEOPLE IN THE LURCH WHEN THEY DO WITH IT WHEN THEY DO SIGN UP FOR IT BUT ALSO DESTABILIZES THE OVERALL. SYSTEM. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TO THE EXTENT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO LOWER THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. INSURERS HAVE TO HAVE TO PROVIDE TO PATIENT CARE RATHER THAN TO ADMINISTRATION PROFITS THEY WANT TO LOWER THAT AND. ANNOUNCED THROUGH REGULATION. BUT IT WILL WE BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ARE CLOSELY IT ACTUALLY RAISING THAT I'M NOT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE. DOLLARS THAT GO TO PATIENT CARE RATHER THAN. DOES OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. AND WITH REGARD TO BROADER MARKET STABILIZATION WE DO BELIEVE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE DO NEED IT OTHER EFFORTS TO TRY TO STABILIZE OUR MARKET. ESPECIALLY WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO SUBSIDIES RATHER THAN THE PENALTY THAT ARE THE MAIN DRIVER OF ENROLLMENT AND SO WELL. AND AT PACKAGE ON GREATER AFFORDABILITY WOULD WOULD HELP IN THAT REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE COVERED. ARM IF THAT WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY A PART A MORE PROGRESSIVE AYE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ENCOURAGE ENROLLMENT SO THAT. AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF INCREASE PREMIUMS BY IF SPIKES AND MORE PEOPLE ON IT UNINSURED THE CBO SUGGESTED THAT. PREMIUMS I'LL WILL GO UP TEN PERCENT AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE TRUMP SABOTAGE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING AND A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION A CALIFORNIANS WOULD LOSE COVERAGE THAT'S A UC BERKELEY FIGURE BASED ON CBO NUMBER. OF THAT WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY THE BACKSLIDING. AND OF COURSE WE NEED AT ONGOING IN OUR VIGILANCE WITH REGARD TO THIS. BUT THAT'S ABOUT JUST STAYING IN THE SAME PLACE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO PORTANTINO DITION OF TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HEALTH REFORMS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THE P. IT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. I YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIPARTISAN TRADITION DATING BACK TO GOVERNOR EARL WARREN. INTO SOME OF THE I WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY OVER MANY YEARS ON THAT CERTAINLY AND THE THIRTY YEARS OF MY ORGANIZATION THE SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION DOING THIS WORK. OF WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN A RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS WORK TOGETHER AND I DO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THESE EFFORTS CAN GET CAN AND SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO TO GET TO THIS GOAL WERE ALL OF. THE QUESTION IS ON SOME OF THESE ARE THE PROPOSALS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON DIFFERENT TRACKS AND DIFFERENT TIME TABLES AND I THINK THAT. OF WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE OF THOSE. TIMES AGAIN AND SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE THROUGH THE GOAL THAT MY ORGANIZATION HAS SUPPORTED SINCE ITS FOUNDING OF OF A UNIVERSAL SINGLE PAYER MEDICARE FOR ALL SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE STRONGLY. ADVOCATE WITH FULL THROATED LEE THAT IT IS A. OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WELL DESIGNED YEAH THIS IS NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THESE GOALS OF. A WELL DESIGNED SYSTEM IS A WAY TO GET TO THE GOT TO GO OF UNIVERSALITY OF HAVING A PROGRESS A PUBLIC PUBLICLY IN PROGRESSIVELY FINANCED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM A SYSTEM THAT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE. I SYSTEM THE ODD THAT HAS COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE THAT IS SIMPLER AND MORE EFFICIENT AND ON THAT IS FOCUSED ON PREVENTION IS RATHER THAN PROFITS. IT IS YEAH. DID. WE DO IT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT ARE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK TO. WE RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT THIS. SYSTEM HE AYE DOES HAVE ITS OBSTACLES AS AS DO MOST HEALTH ROOM CARE REFORMS AYE. AYE THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OBSTACLES TO ANY TYPE OF HEALTH REFORM I HAVE SOME OF THE SCARS ON MY BACK. TO SHOW FOR IT AND IT IS THE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT'S HAVING TO FIGURE OUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT. A EACH GET TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT OBSTACLES AT ONCE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THREADING MULTIPLE NEEDLES AT ONCE I'M THERE IS THE THE POLITICAL FORCES OF INDUSTRY AND IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITIONS THERE'S. YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE ESPECIALLY IF SOMETHING. IF IF YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE COVERAGE THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER. IF IT'S R. DOES THE POLICY ISSUES AND TRADE OFFS INCLUDING FINANCING AND THE PROCESS ISSUES OF OF JUST GETTING THROUGH THE VARIOUS HURDLES. I WENT WHETHER BE ON THE BALLOT IN THE LEGISLATURE OR OTHERWISE I THINK THE. THIS COMMITTEE HAS I THINK. BEEN A VERY HAD HAD A VERY USEFUL SEVERAL HEARINGS THAT HAVE GONE INTO THE DETAILS OF THESE POLICY ISSUES THERE AND I THINK. ARM RAISED A LOT OF THE THE THE RIGHT ISSUES AND THE RIGHT QUESTIONS I'D I THINK THAT DESIRE RESOLVABLE ISSUES BUT THEY DID BUT THEY DO TAKE TIME AND WORK TO DO TO RESOLVE SO DID THESE ARE NOT. TO SAY THAT THESE OBSTACLES HEY YOU CAN'T DO IT THAT CERTAIN DEATH CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I THINK ANYBODY SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM ANY THOSE PRESENTATIONS BUT THEY ARE WE NEED TO BE CLEAR EYED ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. THE WHAT THE ONE ISSUE THAT DOES LOOM LARGE IN IN MY MIND IS THE ONE FOR NEED FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO RECALL A CLAIM. IN IN THE CASE OF A A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. THE. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OR SO FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AYE THE WHAT HOW DO YOU DO THAT OF THROUGH MEDICAID TO MEDICARE. THROUGH THESE OTHERS SYSTEMS IS A REAL. IT IS A REAL CHALLENGE EVEN WITH A FRIENDLY FAN FEDERAL PARTNER AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT HOW I CAN'T WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE CURRENT MINISTRATION. THE AS IT IS ARE IN ISSUE THAT I AYE REYES JUST BECAUSE. EVEN EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. AND. I MEAN EVEN EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE THE IN JUST IN THE LAST YEAR A WE HAVE OF PUT. OF THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS THAT WERE SUBMITTED BY STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND AND NEW YORK WHERE THE PROPOSAL WAS SUBMITTED AND THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION SAYS IF YOU WANT THAT WAIVER FOR THIS RELATIVELY MODEST. A ISSUE OF REINSURANCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT MONEY BY DE FUNDING ANOTHER PART OF YOUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A RESULT. AYE AYE AYE WE NOW HAVE IN THE MEDICAID A SITUATION I A SITUATION WHERE. INDIANA AND OTHER STATES HAVE HAVE THAT WAS SUBMITTED WAIVERS TO INK INTRODUCED WORK REQUIREMENTS AND LOCKOUTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAM WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE. THE. WHETHER IT'S ON IMMIGRATION OR REPRDUCTIVE RIGHTS OR FIVE OTHER ISSUES WHAT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WOULD REQUIRE FOR THE UNPRECEDENTED OF PERMISSIONS THAT WE WOULD BE ASKING FOR INDESCRIBABLE. SO I AGAIN NOT TO IT AYE SO WE WE THINK THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE TO ORGANIZE AND DEVELOP. A THE GOAL OF A SINGLE PAYER ARE OUT MEDICARE FOR ALL TYPE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND WE SHOULD NOW TAKE WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS ARE IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE ARE THAT THAT DO NOT REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT CAN WE DO FOR. DEBT IS WHAT CAN WE DO IN THE NEXT YEAR YEAR UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS UNDER AND YOU GOVERNOR THAT CAN ACTED WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS ON THE GOALS. OF OF ADDRESSING ISSUES OF COST AND QUALITY IN ACCESS AND EQUITY WHY ARE WELL ALSO NOT RUNNING INTO THE BRICK WALL OF FEDERAL APPROVAL WHY AND ALSO WHILE. CONTINUING TO DO THE BROAD DUB THE ORGANIZING THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT THE OTHER WORK ON OUR ADDITIONAL BROADER REFORMS AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY JUST TO BE CLEAR. CALIFORNIA CAN'T WAIT PEOPLE NEED ARM CONTINUE TO HELP NOW AS MUCH PROGRESS AS WE'VE MADE THERE'S AN EDITOR'S MORE WORK TO DO BUT. WE ARE AND WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR FEDERAL APPROVALS WE CAN TAKE CONCRETE ACTIONABLE STEPS THEY ARE IN THE NEXT IT THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. AWHILE ALSO THEN WORKING TOWARD A BROADER VISION AND A BROADER GO AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE IS THESE COMPLIMENTARY EFFORTS. THE COMPLIMENTARY EFFORTS TO YOU ARE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE THINK THAT SOME OF THESE GOALS ARE TO GET TO BETTER UNIVERSALITY AND AFFORDABILITY WE CAN EXPAND COVERAGE TO. TALK TO AYE AYE EXPAND COVERAGE AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS TO COVER ALL REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS SAID NOBODY'S EXCLUDED IMMIGRATION STATUS WE CAN EXTEND AFFORDABILITY IN COVER CALIFORNIA SO THAT NO ONE HAS TO SPEND MORE THAN A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. FOR FOR THE OF OF ON PREMIUM AND REDUCE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING SAID IT'S GREATER AFFORDABILITY WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS ON ISSUES OF COST DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE PRICES DEALING WITH. UNJUSTIFIEDMEDICAL BILLS MAKING SURE THAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE NOT LEFT AT W. AT THE WHIMS OF PRIVATE INSURERS AND. IN A BEAR COUNTY WITHOUT ANY COVERAGE OPTIONS SO THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HERE. THE. WE YOU'VE SEEN THIS SLIDE BEFORE EARLIER. BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT A OF. OUR ACADEMIC COLLEAGUES OF THE UC BERKELEY SUGGESTING WHO IS LEFT REMAINING UNINSURED WE'VE GOTTEN IT UNDER THREE MILLION BUT THERE'S STIRS CLEARLY MORE TO DO. CLEARLY YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF ARE FROM OUR THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND THEN THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES. AND OTHERS WHO ARE WHO ARE JUST ABOVE THAT ARE THAT THAT. THAT THRESHOLD AND WHAT WE ARE SO FAR AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE UNDERSIDE THERE TO TAKE UP MEDI CAL THE ENROLLMENT TODAY'S ABOUT A THIRD AYE. ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION FOLKS THERE'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION ARE A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE BANANA ROLES THAT OVER A DECK OF A RELATIVELY HIGH TAKEN. COVERED CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE IS A PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING TO TAKE UP IS IS IS IS GOOD BUT IT COULD BE A LOT BETTER AND THE QUESTION IS CAN WE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY HELP. IN ADDITION TO THE UNDOCUMENTED I WOULD I I WENT OUT WHICH MY COLLEAGUE WILL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND I WANTED I'D I WENT A COUPLE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NEED MORE HELP. ONE IS SUCKS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE QUOTE UNQUOTE FAMILY GLITCH WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES AND HER FAMILY. AND SO THE WORKER CAN GET COVERAGE BUT THE FOR THE FAMILIES ON AFFORDABLE AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF A GLITCH AND HOW THE SEA WAS WRITTEN AND HOW WAS INTERPRETED. THOSE FOLKS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SUBSIDIES IN THE EXCHANGE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS ARE DIRECTLY ANOTHER IS PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER OF JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF POVERTY LEVEL WHO WEAR SAID THAT HE DID ARE NO SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE. WHO ARE NOW PAYING MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON COVERAGE WE CAN WE WE CAN AND SHOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM WE LIVE IN A HIGH COST OF LIVING STATE? FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA IS FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN IN AMERICA IS FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA AND SIX HUNDRED PERCENT IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO. AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HELP. UNDER WITHIN THE OF OUR. WITHIN UNDER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE HELP WHERE WE IN SOME CASES WE'RE PROVIDING AN EIGHT FOOT ROPE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TEN FOOT HOLE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE HELP GO A LONG WAY. OF GETTING THEM THE THE THAT THE CARING COVERAGE THEY NEED. AND AS YOU CAN SEE AGAIN THE THERE IS A MIX OF THE PEOPLE AT IT IN TERMS OF THE INCOMES THAT THEY REPRESENT. AND I WOULD SO AGAIN HE'S TO. IT WE CAN WE ARE HEARTBREAKINGLY CLOSE TO UNIVERSALITY IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GONE FROM TWENTY PERCENT TO SEVEN PERCENT THE LARGEST DROP. WE DID TWO BIG STEPS ARE ONE IS INTRODUCING MORE AFFORDABILITY COVERED CALIFORNIA TO SET A SECOND IS COVERING THE UNDOCUMENTED AND TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE BETSY ESTUDIO. WHO WE'VE BEEN PER UP FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WHO'S BEEN OUR COACH SHARE ON THE HEALTH FOR ALL CAMPAIGN TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO? TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDS IMMIGRATION STATUS HOW TURNED OVER TO HER. YOU ANTHONY. CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME. OKAY GREAT SO GOOD AFTERNOON AYE CHEERS AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS BUT HAVE A LIST OF THE OIL CYCLE BY BETSY. AND THE SENIOR POLICY MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER SO I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT A HEALTH FOR ALL PROPOSAL. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND CAN SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE GAINS WE'VE MADE ON IMMIGRANT HEALTH. AND THEN TELL YOU HOW WE ACTUALLY GET TO. OF A REALITY WHERE HEALTH FOR A WAS PASSED IN OUR STATE SO. AND TO BEGIN AYE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. SO WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN RESPONSE TO VERY HARSH FEDERAL LAWS THAT. EXCLUDED AT CERTAIN IMMIGRANTS FROM VITAL SOCIAL AND UP PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS TODAY CA PC CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE FOR INCLUSIVE AND HEALTH. INCLUSIVE HEALTH AND PUBLIC POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE WELL BEING OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. SO IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY EXCLUSIONS. ARE BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS HARM OUR STATE I LIKE TO BEGIN WITH SOME DEMOGRAPHICS AND KEY DATA ABOUT THE POPULATION IN QUESTION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA SO ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT NINE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS IN OUR STATE. ONE IN SIX OF ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAVE AT LEAST ONE UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS AND ONE IN TEN WORKERS IS AN UNDOCUMENTED WORKER ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS COUNTRY READ A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION PER YEAR TO OUR STATE ECONOMY. AND OVER HALF OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. RALLIES THAT DECADE. SO IN ADDITION IMMIGRANTS ARE ALSO VERY DIVERSE. WHILE WE KNOW THAT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE LEFT. ARE THE FASTEST GROWING IMMIGRANT POPULATION ARE ACTUALLY ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA SIXTEEN PERCENT OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE API. AS YOU CAN SEE IMMIGRANTS ARE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD THEIR WORKERS ACROSS A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES AND ARE LONGTIME RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE. MAY PROVIDE ACT INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN OUR SOCIAL FABRIC. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE STORY OF ISABELLA AND HER MOTHER DAISY WHO'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SLIDE. HE SAID WELL AS A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL FROM COLUMBIA WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM SEVERAL POLICY SINCE SHE WAS BORN. IN ORDER TO SEEK TREATMENT. FORTY SEVEN US CONDITION ASSEMBLY LINE HER MOTHER IMMIGRATED TO CALIFORNIA AND SEARCH OF HEALTH CARE. WHICH THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THEM THE HOME COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS HE SAID WELL I WASN'T ABLE TO ACCESS COMPREHENSIVE CARE BECAUSE OF OUR IMMIGRATION STATUS. BUT THINGS TO HOLD FOR ALL KIDS SHE NOW WAS ABLE TO GET PRIMARY CARE PHYSICAL AND SPEECH THERAPY AND IS ABLE TO THRIVE. ISABELLA RELIES ON HER MOTHER DAISY TO TAKE CARE FOR. BUT DAISY HERSELF IS EXCLUDED FROM HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF HER IMMIGRATION STATUS. SO WHAT HAPPENS TO DAISY WHEN SHE GETS SICK. WHAT IS I MEAN FOR A SUB ELLA? SO A LITTLE BIT OF MORE BACKGROUND I'M SO WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO HAVE A FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS LIKE DAISY. I NOT HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WELL. UP THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY UNJUSTLY EXCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM RECEIVING HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID HOW. AND SELECTING A PLAN OR RECEIVING SUBSIDIES TO COVER CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THIS BETTER EXCLUSION THERE THERE IS SOME CARE PROVIDED TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE AND I'M GONNA I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE ON THE LIST. SO FIRST THERE IS RESTRICTED SCHOOL MEDIC CAO WHICH PROVIDES LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WITH EMERGENCY CARE. THERE IS PREGNANCY RELATED CARE THROUGH MEDI CAL WHICH GIVES IMMIGRANT WOMEN PREGNANCY RELATED MEDICAL CARE AS WELL AS ALL OTHER PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY A SPECIALTY CARE. AS I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WHICH GIVES UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE FULL SCOPE MEDICARE HOW. AND WE ALSO HAVE A SAFETY NET. WHERE AT SOME COUNTIES PROVIDE SOME CARE AND TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS TO THEIR SAFETY NET SYSTEMS BUT? THERE ARE STILL MANY COUNTIES THAT DO NOT. AND THEM FOR DOT GOV RECIPIENTS. LOW INCOME DOCTOR RECIPIENTS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE MEDICARE HOW AS INDIVIDUALS WHO FALL UNDER A BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY CATEGORY KNOWN AS PRUE CALLS. AND THAT I I KNOW THERE'S BEEN RECENT NEWS AROUND THE DECISION TO. TERMINATE DHAKA BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS CLARIFIED THAT DACA RECIPIENTS WHO LOSE THEIR DEFERRED ACTION STATUS WILL STILL CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE UNDER OUR FORCE WONDERFUL SCHOOL MEDI CAL. SO HOWEVER THIS PATCHWORK OF CARE STILL LEAVES MANY UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WITH NO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AS A RESULT FIFTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO REMAIN UNINSURED ARE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS THIS IS WHY IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE TALK ABOUT. UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS AS PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SO MONO WALKING THROUGH SOME PASSED LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT THE HEALTH FOR ALL CAMPAIGN A COALITION HAS AS MOVE FORWARD. UM C. A. B. C. HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA AND OUR HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION LAUNCHED EFFORTS TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE INCLUSIVE FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND IT WE HERE ARE SOME KEY SUCCESSES IN THE HEALTH FOR ALL CAMPAIGN. SO I'M WE ARE FIRST SUCCESS WITH HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IMMIGRANTS AND HEALTH CARE ADVOCATES WORK TOGETHER TO PASS SB SEVENTY FIVE. AND S. BEFORE KNOWN AS HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS. HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WAS ENACTED IN MAY SIXTEENTH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND PROVIDING FULL SCOPE MEDICAID TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF NINETEEN. SINCE THEN OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN HAVE HAD ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. THE NEXT. BILL WE WORKED ON WAS S. B. TEN. WHICH WAS OUR THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WEAVERVILLE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN S. B. TEN DIRECT THAT THE STATE TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL WAIVER. FEDERAL THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER ALLOWING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND DOCTOR RECIPIENTS TO PURCHASE ON SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE. AYE INCORRECT HEALTH WARNING. HOWEVER THE WAIVER WAS RESCINDED DUE TO CONCERNS OVER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TARGETING OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. AND THEN LAST YEAR. THE HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS BUDGET PROPOSAL IN TO REMOVE A CRITICAL BARRIER TO HEALTH ACCESS BY PROVIDING FULL SCOPE MEDICARE. TO UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DID INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET INVESTMENT. BUT HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INACTIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATE BUDGET. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THESE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TO BRING US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE. AND WE CAN DO THAT THIS YEAR WITH HEALTH FOR ALL. TWO WEEK REITERATE HEALTH FOR ALL IS A PROPOSAL THAT ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE REGARDLESS OF IT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THERE ARE SOME LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS OUT THERE. IN MID DECEMBER THE ASSEMBLY RELEASED A BUDGET BLUEPRINT THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PRIORITIES FOR THIS YEAR WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDING MEDICARE ACCESS TO COVER ALL UNINSURED. WE APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLIES CONTINUE SUPPORT FROM LAST YEAR WHICH I KNOW MANY OF YOU SUPPORTED AND CHAMPION. HELPFUL YOUNG ADULTS. AND INCLUDE AN INCLUDING HEALTH FOR ALL AND THEIR BUDGET BLUEPRINT THIS YEAR WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU VERY CLOSELY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND THEN. ON THE SENATE SIDE AYE CENTER RECOLETA DID INTRODUCE OUT RECENTLY INTRODUCED S. B. NINE SEVEN FOR IT WHICH WOULD IN PROVIDE FULL SCOPE MEDICAID TO LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SELASSIE ARE JUST SAY THAT THE IS VERY POOR AND TO NOTE THAT THE NATION NEEDS CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP NOW MORE THAN EVER AND WITH HEALTH FOR ALL WILL BE ABLE TO HELP. OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THRIVE AND CREATE A MODEL FOR THE NATION THANK YOU. IN MY. THANK YOU BETSY AND IN IN MY AYE AGAIN WE GREATLY APPRECIATE PARTNERING WOULD SEE IF YOU SEE AN WITH THE DOZENS AND OF GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND WE WE THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE. ANOTHER LARGE STRIDE THIS YEAR ON THAT FRONT ARE AND AGAIN WE ARE SO CLOSE TO UNIVERSALITY BUT I DO WANT TO. ALSO TALK DEAD DEAD THERE'S ALSO WORK TO DO WITH REGARD TO NOT JUST MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ACCESS TO CARE BUT ALSO THAT THEY. ARE DEAD THAT WE ADDRESS ISSUES OF COST AND QUALITY IN EQUITY ON SOME OF THIS IS ALREADY AN AGENDA THAT IS ALREADY IAN. ARE IN LINE IN. IN PROPOSED AND I IN FRONT OF YOU AYE AGAIN YOU YOU TOOK A IMPORTANT STEP LAST YEAR WITH S. B. SEVENTEEN ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES THERE SEVERAL OTHER BILLS. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES WHETHER IT'S ARE WITH REGARD TO FARMERS PRACTICE OF PROVIDING GIVES TO PROVIDERS. IT DID TO POSSIBLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON. SO IT SUBSCRIBING OR THE ISSUE OF PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT MANUFACTURERS THAT CHAIRMAN WOULD IS WORKING ON OR OF WORK TO JUST MAKE MAINTAIN AND ACCOUNT AND EXTEND. ON CAPS ON CO PAYMENTS FOR THE OF SPECIALTY MEDICAL DRUGS. I I I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK ON THE ISSUE OF CONSOLIDATION WHICH HAS SERVED. TO DRIVE UP PRICES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AN EVEN INCLUDING BILLS ON WORKING ARE A TOOK PRIDE OVERSIGHT OVER. HEALTH PLAN MERGERS AGAIN CHAIRMAN WOULD AND HAS THAT BILL AND IN ANOTHER BILL IN THE SENATE. OR THAT HAS PASSED THE SENATE IS NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THE ISSUE OF. UNFAIR AND ANTI COMPETITIVE HOSPITAL CONTRACT PROVISIONS WHICH HAVE SERVED HIM TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE LED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF RACE AS AN EXAMPLE OF. IT ULTIMATELY. WHATEVER SYSTEM WE WE PUT IN PLACE WE NEED TO DO ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF PRICES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SINGLE PAYER IS USEFUL IN BUILDING A PURCHASING POOL. THAT IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO BARGAIN FOR THE IT OF A FOR PRICE BUT YOU STILL NEED A MECHANISM TO. CHANGE THAT WE AND WOOD WHATEVER SYSTEM YOU HAVE AND IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AMERICANS DO NOT USE MORE HEALTHCARE THAN ANY OTHER. THE COUNTRY IT IS THE UNIT PRICE THAT IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IN IN THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY PLACE ELSE AND WE NEED TO PLAY WE NEED A MECHANISM TO REVIEW. TO TO REVIEW AND AND BENCHMARK AND AND LOOK AT THOSE PRICES I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES IN BUSINESS AND LABOR WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. AND FINALLY WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY OVER OUR OF MANAGED CARE PLANS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE PUBLICLY FINANCED TO THEM IT IS IT OUT TO OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THER IS. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR QUALITY IN EQUITY IF THE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLANS WHETHER THEY BE PUBLIC PART OF PRIVATE PROP OF FOR PROFIT OR NONPROFIT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTION PROVIDING. THE CARE THAT WE'RE CONTACTING THEM FOR. ANOTHER OPTION THAT IS BEING THAT. WE WOULD. THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK INTO IS WITH REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT NO CALIFORNIANS SPECIALLY THOSE ARE BETTER IN RURAL AREAS ARE LEFT. WITHOUT ANY COVERAGE OPTIONS WHATSOEVER. THE ISSUE OF BEAR COUNTIES YEAH EASE ONE THAT SOME OTHER STATES HAVE DEALT WITH AND. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER IT'S THAT NORTH OF SACRAMENTO REGION OR CENTRAL COAST OVER OUR CENTRAL VALLEY DEAD A CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ARE NOT LEFT WITHOUT A COVERAGE OPTION. AND IF IF IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH. I AND IF AT THAT IF THAT ISSUE DOES COME UP ABOUT THAT WE HAVE WE USE THE MEDIC HOW INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO MAKE WHETHER TO THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE THE EXISTING PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN OPTION. FINAL THING I'D JUST LIKE TO WRAP UP IS THAT AGAIN WE THINK THAT THERE IS AN ASPIRATIONAL AGENDA HERE AS COMPLEMENTARY WITH THE BROADER LONG IT'S A VISION THAT IS ON. AT A DIFFERENT TIME TABLE TO DO THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO THAT IT ARE. THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WITHOUT FEDERAL APPROVAL TO STABILIZE THE MARKET AND RESISTANCE ADVERTISE TO GET TO UNIVERSALITY IN AFFORDABILITY AND TO START DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF COST QUALITY IN EQUITY. AND. AND I THE. THE ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY SOME ON. YOUR SENATOR TED  Z OTHERS SAY THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO SINGLE PAYER. AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE I THINK DAD'S. HE ARE HE WAS HE WAS WRONG HE GOT THE METAPHOR REVERSE IT'S A. IT'S A IT'S NOT. IT IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE CLOSER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S NOT GOING IT'S NOT SO BE SLOWED DOWN THE MATHIS SCALING UP THE MOUNTAIN. IT'S HOW CAN WE CAN DO AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO GO UP ENOUGH AND TO THE GO TO THE VISION OF EVERYBODY HAVING. THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT WITHOUT FINANCIAL BARRIERS AND WHAT WE THINK IS THAT THE STEPS ACTUALLY GETS THAT MUCH CLOSER ACTUALLY DID ARE BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE POLICY INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TO THAT GOAL AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT WE DON'T WE GET WE DON'T SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR FEDERAL APPROVALS OR THE OTHER OBSTACLES ARE NO WAY WE CAN TAKE STEPS NOW. TO GET THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WE ALL DESERVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HAVE SARAH FLOCKS WITH THE LABOR. FEDERATION AS WELL AS PETER FENN FROM THE TEAM. YOU GET AFTERNOON. MANY MISS APPEAR FAN I'M THE SECRETARY TREASURER AND PRINCIPAL OFFICER OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL EIGHT FIVE SIX AM THE RECORDING SECRETARY. OF JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN OF THE TEAMSTERS COVERING A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I WANTED UP UP FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. HEALTHCARE IS SOMETHING THAT THAT I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. ALONGWITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SKYROCKETING COST THE HEALTH CARE IS AMONG THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. FACING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE CASE FOR THE WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT OUR LOCAL UNION TEAMSTERS LOCAL EIGHT FIVE SIX REPRESENTS THIRTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING AT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS. IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN EVERY INDUSTRY YOU CAN THINK OF FROM FROM SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. FROM HOTEL WORKERS TO TO AIRLINE MECHANICS. AND WHILE THE WORKERS WE REPRESENT ARE VERY DIFFERENT THERE THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS WHERE MEMBERS WORK. HEALTHCARE IS THE MOST CHALLENGING ISSUE WE FACE EVERY BARGAINING TABLE. THE CHALLENGERS WORKERS SPACE AROUND HEALTH CARE. ARE SIGNIFICANT. THE SKYROCKETING COSTS IN HEALTHCARE IS MAKING THE EMPLOYEE SHARE OF MONTHLY MEDICAL PREMIUMS REACHED BUT AFFORDABLE LEVELS. AND AS MORE MORE MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED FROM SALARY TO HEALTH CARE THERE'S DOWNWARD PRESSURE. ON WAGES WE'VE ALSO SEEN RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS RESULT IN FEWER PLANCHA VOICES. BENEFIT LEVEL REDUCTIONS AND WORST OF ALL. AND WORST OF ALL MORE EMPLOYERS OR ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO THE USE OF PART TIME. AND TEMPERATURES. I SPEND. I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME. I SPEND MOST MY TIME BARGAINING CONTRACTS ALONGSIDE THE MEMBERS THAT WE REPRESENT. IN NEGOTIATIONS WHY START THE DISCUSSION ON HEALTH CARE WITH AN EMPLOYER ALWAYS BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT IT'S. IT'S EIGHT SHARE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE TOGETHER. I MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY DID NOT CREATE THE PROBLEM. THAT OUR MEMBERS DIDN'T EITHER. THAT THE SKYROCKETING COST OF HEALTHCARE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DROPPED IN OUR LAP. BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG LEFT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO PAY FOR? THE PROBLEM. IT IS THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS JUST KEEP GOING UP AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT. IT IS BECOMING UNSUSTAINABLE. OF FOR EXAMPLE MY WE REPRESENT WORKERS IN MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE BAY AREA. THESE DISTRICTS CONTRACT WITH CALPERS FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE. BUT GUESS WHAT EVEN CALPERS. WITH ITS HUGE STATEWIDE BUYING POWER CAN'T KEEP RATES DOWN. THE MONTHLY THE MONTHLY PREMIUM FOR A BASIC KAISER FAMILY PLANNING. TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. THAT'S TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AGAIN. THIS IS NOT A CADILLAC PLAN THIS IS A BASIC KAISER FAMILY POINT. THAT THE TWO BIGGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE WE REPRESENT WORKERS THE EMPLOYER PAYS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE KAISER IT. AT FIRST GLANCE. THIS DOESN'T SEEM UNFAIR EMPLOYERS PAYING NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE. IN FAMILY MEDICAL. BUT THE STORY GETS WORSE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PAYCHECK OF A WORKER. FOR EXAMPLE A CUSTODIAN. MAKES JUST UNDER TWENTY BUCKS AN HOUR FOR FORTY. THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AFTER TAXES TAKEN PAYS JUST JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE ON ABOUT A MONTH. THEY HAVE TO PAY YOUR TWENTY PERCENT OF THE KAISER FAMILY POINT. THAT'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AFTER PAYING THAT FOUR DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR HEALTHCARE THAT LEAVES JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR. RENT. CLOTHES FOR THE KIDS FOR GROCERIES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF DAILY LIFE. IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT THE WORST OF IT ONE VERY COUNTY WHERE WE JUST RECENTLY ORGANIZED WORKERS. THE EMPLOYEE MONTHLY SHARE FOR KAISER FOR THE EMPLOYEES. MONTHLY SHARE FOR THE KAISER FAMILY PLAN WAS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR. OTHER PLANTS PARTICULAR IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS THAT. WE FACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE OUTRAGEOUS HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE SIMPLY. ON AFFORDABLE. I IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MAINTAINING QUALITY HEALTHCARE IS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF WAGES. OUR MEMBERS DIVERTING SALARY INCREASES TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE. FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY WILL WE REPRESENT A THOUSAND WORKERS IN SAN FRANCISCO. HEALTHCARE NOW COSTS OVER TWELVE DOLLARS. PER OUR. YES TWELVE DOLLARS PER HOUR THAT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BEING DIVERTED FROM WAGES TO HEALTH CARE. MONEY THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY HELP WORKERS MANAGE THE EVER INCREASING COST OF LIVING. IN OUR EXPERIENCE IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE OUT OF CONTROL HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE KEY DRIVER IN WAGES STAGNATION. SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE ALSO LEAD TO ELIMINATION OF PLANNED TO RACES AND REDUCTION OF BENEFIT LEVELS NON KAISER HMO AND PPO IS BEING ELIMINATED TO CUT COSTS. AND WHEN WE CAN KEEP THOSE OPTIONS DEDUCTIBLES AND CO IN COPAYS ARE ARE GOING UP. THE MOST DISTURBING OF ALL. EMPLOYERS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR DEALING WITH THE SPIKES OF HEALTH CARE COSTS BY DENYING ACCESS TO MEDICAL COVERAGE TO THE USE OF PART TIME AND TEMPORE KERR'S. AT ONE IMPLORE WE JUST ORGANIZED OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS IN THE UNIT ONLY SIX HUNDRED QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL BENEFITS. THIS ABUSE A PART TIME AND TEMPORARY WORKERS IS A DIRECT RESULT. OF THE IMPACT OF SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS. IN ADDITION TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS. I'M ALSO A TRUSTEE ON A UNION TAFT HARTLEY TRUST FUND THE COVERS TEAMSTER MEMBERS THEIR FAMILIES. RETIREES. THE TRUST FUND CONTRACTS WITH KAISER ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. AND OFFERS A SELF FUNDED PPL WERE THE TRUST FUND PAYS THE CLAIMS DIRECTLY. IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN PASSAGE OF THE HEALTH CARE TRANSPARENCY LOCKED AS BE FIVE FOUR SIX THE PRESSURE FROM SACRAMENTO. SEEM TO HAVE AN IMPACT. WE SAW FEW YEARS OF LOW RATE INCREASES FROM KAISER AN ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. AS A TRUST FUND. WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US TO KEEP RATES DOWN. WE HIRED A DATA WAREHOUSE COMPANY TO ANALYZE UTILIZATION. WITH THE DATA WE WERE NOW ABLE TO ATTAIN FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND WE GREW A TRUST FUND BY ADDING PARTICIPANTS. IN FACT WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE SIZE. OF OUR TRUST FUND. UNFORTUNATELY. IT APPEARS WE HAVE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE TRANSPARENCY LAW. AND THE DAYS OF HUGE DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES ARE BACK WITH US. AND BACK IN A BIG WAY LISTEN TO THIS. KAISER JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE INCREASING OUR RATE BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. THENANKAI THEIR HMO IS WORSE. ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IS PROPOSING A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE THAT MEANS THE FAMILY RATE WILL BE GOING UP. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND WHETHER IT'S THE EMPLOYER PAYING FOR. FOR THE EMPLOYEES. IT'S ABSOLUTELY. UNSUSTAINABLE. ON OUR SELF FUNDED DIRECT PAY PPO SIDE. I WAS TOLD BY OUR EXPERTS THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE COST. WAS THE GREATEST SKINNY NETWORK HOSPITALS. IN OTHER WORDS CUT OUT THE HOSPITALS THAT CHARGE THE MOST. BUT HERE'S THE CATCH. THAT WOULD LIMIT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE HOSPITALS THAT OUR MEMBERS DEPEND ON USING. AND OF COURSE THAT'S A A NON STARTER. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS. I'M FRUSTRATED. DISHEARTENED. THE STATUS QUO'S IT IS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE. CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE WORD A BREAKING POINT. THAT WE'RE OUT WE'RE OUT OF OPTIONS FOR WORKERS EMPLOYERS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. WE NEED A STRONG LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THAT CONTROLS COSTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. I'M HOSPITALS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. I WANT TO CLOSE BY MAKING IT CLEAR. WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE STAND READY. TO WORK WITH YOU. STILL ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO. THANK YOU. MR SHARES MEMBERS THERE OF LOCKS ME THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE LABOR FEDERATION REPRESENTS TWELVE HUNDRED AFFILIATED UNIONS UNIONS JUST LIKE PETERS. THAT BOTH BARGAINED FOR AND PURCHASE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR OUR TWO MILLION UNION MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. I DID WAS START BY THINKING THIS COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR THE GREAT WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THESE HEARINGS I'VE WATCHED AND RE WATCHED. EVERYONE IF YOU LIKE I HAVE A PHD NOW IN HEALTH CARE SO THANK YOU FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT WORK. AND I JUST WANNA START. MY PRESENTATION BY SAYING THAT THE LABOR FEDERATION SUPPORT SINGLE PAYER. WE HAVE OVER THE DECADES SUPPORTED BILLS TO MOVE TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WE ALSO SUPPORT S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. SUIT IN MY PRESENTATION TODAY I'M GONNA TALK TO THAT THE COMMITTEE ABOUT OPTIONS THAT MOVE US CLOSER TO THE GOAL OF SINGLE PAYER AND TO A UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE STATE. SU AD DATED DECEMBER HEARING THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAD GOVERNOR SOMEONE FROM FOR MONTHS OFFERED SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT I THOUGHT WERE WERE VERY APT TO START MY PRESENTATION HE SAID THAT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE ALSO APPLIES TO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. WHETHER YOU PAY FOR IT THROUGH PUBLIC FUNDS. OR THROUGH THE CURRENT PRIVATE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NO SYSTEM WILL WORK UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO CUT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE. AND HE RECOMMENDED TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE GET COSTS COULD CONTAINMENT RIGHT FIRST AND THEN WE CAN CONSOLIDATE INTO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. AND THE LABOR FEDERATION. KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT COST CONTAINMENT AS YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO PETER TALK AND AND NOT FEEL THE URGENCY OF HAVING TO DO TO BE ABLE TO GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL. AND WE'VE TRIED EVERY YEAR TO FOCUS ON SMALL PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY TO DO THAT WE'VE MOVED. BILLS AROUND AND THE PRICE OF CHRISTIAN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE SUPPORTED MISTER WOODS BILL ON PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS WE'VE DONE WORK ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS. AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE ANTI COMPETITIVE PRICING OF HOSPITALS. BUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT. WE STILL SEE THAT EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND ON RISING HEALTH CARE PRICES. IS A DOLLAR THAT'S COMING RIGHT OUT A WORKERS POCKETS. AND SO WE KNOW THROUGH DESPITE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF COST CONTAINMENT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING UP AGAINST A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. BUT IT IS CRITICAL IT IS CRITICAL BOTH AS A FIRST STEP TO SINGLE PAYER AND IT IS CRITICAL TO WORKING PEOPLE AND TO CALIFORNIANS. SO YOU SEE IF I CAN USE THIS. OKAY SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE SUFFERING FROM. BILL TWO LINES GOING UP OUR PREMIUMS AN EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PREMIUMS. THE FLAT LINES OUR WAGES AND INFLATION. AND IN THAT GAP. THAT IS THE WHOLE WHERE ARE MIDDLE CLASS IS FALLING. THAT IS WHAT IS EATING UP OUR MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO ON THIS SIDE YOU ALSO SEE IN THIS IS BEEN EMPHASIZED OVER AND OVER THAT THE U. S. SPENDS ALMOST TWICE WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES SPEND ON HEALTHCARE. BUT AN INTERESTING PART OF THIS SLIDE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DARK BLUE LINE. THAT'S PUBLIC EXPENDITURE. THAT'S KIND OF ON PAR OR LESS THAN WHAT A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES SPEND OUR REAL PROBLEM IS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. IN THE MARKET WHERE WE HAVE OUR TRUST FUNDS THE INDIVIDUAL THE SMALL THE LARGE GROUP THE SELF INSURED THAT'S WHERE SPENDING IS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. AND WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THAT ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HERE. THE ONE THING THAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON. AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES WITH UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE HAVE IN COMMON WHETHER THERE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM OR A MULTI PAYER SYSTEM. IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT REGULATE HEALTH CARE PRICES AND CONTROLS COSTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM INCLUDING IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IF THEY HAVE. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT AGAIN AND ALSO EMPHASIZE WET AND ANTHONY SAID. IS THAT IT REALLY IS THE PRICES. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE SPENDING OUR HEALTH CARE COST IS JUST. PRICE. TIMES UTILIZATION AND IF YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS GRAPH. ONCE AGAIN ALL THE LINES GOING UP. DOES OUR PRICES. THE LINE'S GOING DOWN. IS UTILIZATION. SO EVEN THE U. S.. WE ARE USING LAST HEALTH CARE. GETTING WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND YET PAYING MORE FOR EVERY SINGLE DOCTOR VISIT EVERY SINGLE HOSPITAL SERVICE EVERY SINGLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG. DAN UP PEOPLE PAY IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AND SO PRICES ARE WHAT ARE DRIVING OVERALL COSTS IN THIS IS. AND AND PETER RATES S. B. FIVE FORTY SIX WHICH IS A BILL THAT WE DID ON HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. TODAY IN SAN FRANCISCO D. MHC IS HAVING A PUBLIC HEARING LOOKING AT THE RATE FILINGS OF HEALTH PLANS AND IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THOSE HEARING HERE THAT FILINGS. YOU WILL SEE THE SAME THING IS THE SLIDE UTILIZATION REMAINS FLAT. PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING AND THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING PREMIUM INCREASES. THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE PRICES HIGH BUT THEY VARY WILDLY. SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE RANGE OF M. ARISE IN THE HUNDRED MILE AREA AROUND SAN FRANCISCO WHICH REYES. RANGE FROM FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE HOSPITAL'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER THAT ARE CHARGING THIS VARIATION PRICES SOMETIMES YOU HAVE PATIENTS IN THE SAME HOSPITAL FOR THE SAME SERVICE. THAT ARE PAYING WILDLY DIFFERENT PRICES DEPENDING ON. WHO HAS THE COVERAGE OF THEIR AYE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID? SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY WERE THE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH BUT THEY ARE OPAQUE. AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE SO THERE'S MASSIVE PRICE DISCRIMINATION. AND SO. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS? PETER IS SAD THAT CALPERS IN SOME OF THAT THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE LARGEST UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. HAVE TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE PROBLEM OF COSTS. THEY'VE TRIED TO USE THE TOOLS OF TRANSPARENCY THEY'VE TRIED TO DO BENEFIT DESIGN REFERENCE PRICING. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OFFERS OF TRYING TO GO TO NARROW NETWORKS TO EXCLUDING HOSPITALS. ALL OF THIS WE'VE TRIED TO DO OUR SELVES AS PURCHASERS TO REALLY GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL. BUT WE ARE STILL AT THE POINT WHERE THE PRICES ARE GOING UP. WE KEEP HAVING TO PAY THEM. AND IT IS GETTING TO THE POINT TO BE A REAL CRISIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE. AND THAT IS WHY WE REALLY DO NEED LEGISLATORS AND DO NEED THE GOVERNMENT POLICY MAKERS TO TAKE BOLD ACTION TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY DO COST CONTAINMENT ACROSS THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. I'D I DON'T THAT'S THE EASY PART USE THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM OKAY WHAT WE DO. SO I WOULD SAY THAT EVEN KNOW AMAZON AND I'D JPMORGAN CHASE IN BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF PLAY IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. WE DON'T REALLY NEED BIG COMPANIES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT THIS COUNTRY. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO DO WE ALREADY HAVE SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE EXAMPLES IN THIS COUNTRY OF HOW WE CAN START TO GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL. I'M SO I WILL START WITH MEDICARE. MEDICARE IS. A PROGRAM THAT YOU KNOW EVERYONE WHAT GETTING GOVERNOR SOMEONE SAID WAS THE ONLY GOOD REASON TO TURN SIXTY FIVE. WAS TO GET ON TO MEDICARE. IT IS THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC IN THE WAY THAT IT SETS RATES. IT SETS RATES THAT ARE PAID TO HOSPITALS TO DOCTORS AND FOR OUT PATIENT SERVICES. IT'S A MODEL THAT NOT ONLY COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA BUT HAS ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE GERMANY AND AUSTRALIA. AND THEY'VE A PRIDE APPLIED IT WAY MORE BROADLY THAN JUST FOR PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE THEY'VE APPLIED AT A TO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET AS WELL. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THAT THE PLIGHT THAT I PRESENTED AT THE COST SAVINGS THAT THEY HAVE. IT ALSO IS FLEXIBLE IN THAT IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL RATES RATES ARE ADJUSTED THEIR ADJUSTED FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES FOR WAGES FOR OUT LIARS. FOR HOSPITALS THAT ARE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THAT SERVE MORE LOW INCOME OR MEDICAID PATIENTS. AND AND SO THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT MEDICARE AS A MODEL IS THAT THERE IS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND SO THIS IS AN OPTION. FOR. PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO. MEDICARE ENROLLEES AND SO IN CALIFORNIA FORTY PERCENT OF MEDICARE ENROLLEES ARE IN ADVANTAGE PLANS. IN THIS IS WHERE THERE'S A CAPITATED RATE THAT IS PAID SO IT'S NOT JUST A MODEL FOR FEE FOR SERVICE BUT FOR OTHER PAYMENT MODELS AND YET IT STILL RETAINS. MEDICARE'S MODEL OF SETTING RATES AND CONTROLLING PRICES. TROLLING THE PRICE THAT IS PAID TO PROVIDERS ACROSS THIS IS. AND THEN THERE'S MARYLAND YOU HAD A GREAT PRESENTATION FROM MARYLAND ON THAT THE MOB THE SYSTEM THAT THEY USE. AND THEY USE SOMETHING CALLED ALL PAYER RATE SETTING THIS IS A MODEL THAT IS ALSO USED BY MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO. CONTROL COSTS AND PRICES AND IT'S FRANCE GERMANY JAPAN THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND. AND MARILYN SINCE THE SEVENTIES HAS SAT AT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET THE RATES THAT ARE PAID TO HOSPITALS. AND AND SO THEY USE A MEDICARE LIKE MODEL AND THEY SAY. OKAY. WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE BUT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU WE ARE GOING TO CONTROL THE PRICE AND THOSE ARE THE PRICES THAT ARE PAID. BY EVERYBODY BY MEDICARE BY MEDICAID. BY THE SELF INSURED AND BY ANYBODY COVERED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. MEDICARE DID RUN INTO SOME ISSUES IN THAT OR IT'S AYE MARYLAND INTO SOME ISSUES IN THAT. WHEN YOU SQUEEZE THE BALLOON AT ONE END. SOMETIMES EXPANDS AT THE OTHER END AND SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN TO ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT PRICE. YOU MAY HAVE A GROWTH IN THE VOLUME OF SERVICES IN THE INTENSITY OF SERVICES IT MIGHT NOT ACCOUNT FOR IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT HOSPITAL'S SHIFTS TO OUT PATIENT SETTINGS. THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO RATE SETTING. AND EVEN IN THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE CONTROLLING PRICE YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE AN INCREASE IN OVERALL SPENDING BECAUSE YOUR NOT LOOKING AT THAT. FULL BALLOON TIME TO CONTINUE THE EXAMPLE. SO MARILYN RESPONDED TO THAT ISSUE BY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ADDING A BUDGET CAP SO BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT OVERALL HOW MUCH. HEALTHCARE SPENDING THERE IS ACROSS THE SYSTEM WHILE KEEPING IN PLACE THE RATE SETTING THAT THEY'VE HAD SINCE THE SEVENTIES AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME GOOD RESULTS FROM THAT SO THERE ARE MODELS OUT THERE FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON EFFECTIVE COST CONTAINMENT THAT WILL. REALLY DO SOMETHING FOR PETER'S LOCAL AND FOR PEOPLE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. AND SO I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH A FULL PROPOSAL THAT. WE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF CORE PRINCIPLES AS WE MOVE FORWARD LOOKING AT AT COST CONTAINMENT. ONE IS THAT IT BUILDS TOWARDS A UNIVERSAL SINGLE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. AND THIS IS ONE ELEMENT OF IT A KEY ELEMENTS AND AN ELEMENT THAT WILL. IMPACT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO REALLY GET CONTROL ABOUT HOW MUCH OUR PEOPLE ARE SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE. THAT THIS THE COST CONTAINMENT HAS THE OVERALL GOAL OF COMPLETE OF CONTAINING COSTS. WHICH YOU NEED TO LOOK AT AS BOTH THE PRICE. AND UTILIZATION. THAT IT INCREASES QUALITY. THAT IT IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES ONE BECAUSE WE CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT OUR MEMBERS HEALTH AND TWO BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES GOOD LONG TERM SENSE TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY. AND REDUCES DISPARITIES IN THE SYSTEM THROUGH A FORM OF REGULATION. FOURTH THAT IT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY. TO ASSURE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE REGULATED ENTITIES BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE FULLY FUNCTIONING HOSPITALS AND CLINICS IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE MEMBERS IN VERY RURAL DISTRICTS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO. FAR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOSPITAL'S THAT THEY NEED TO GO TO AN ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AS WELL AS TO COUNT ACCOUNT FOR REASONABLE COSTS INCLUDING LABOR COSTS. HOSPITALS AND IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS A BIG EMPLOYER IN THE STATE TO BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THE ECONOMY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT STAYS THAT WAY. AND THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND WHO BUILD HOSPITALS AND WHO PROVIDE. HEALTH FOOD SERVICES IN JANITORIAL ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING. AND AND ALSO THAT THAT'S SYSTEM. OPERATES WITH MAXIMUM SIMPLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY. SO THAT WE ALL MOVED FROM THIS REALLY OPAQUE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW TO ONE THAT WE CAN ALLUNDERSTAND AND CAN ACCESS. AND I WILL ADD ONE OF THE BULLET POINTS THAT IS NOT ON HERE IS JUST URGENCY. AND THAT TACKLING COSTS IN DOING COST CONTAINMENT EVEN IF WE SAY THAT IT'S AT A STOP ON THE ROAD TO SINGLE PAYER IT'S A BIG JOB AND IT IS. AN URGENT JOB AND IT IS ONE THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN AND EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND SO IT IS A TASK THAT IT IS WORTH TAKING ON. I KNOW THIS IS THIS COMMITTEE HAS SPENT. HOURS AND HOURS PREPARING FOR THIS TAX AT TAX SKIN IS VERY WELL PREPARED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND TO ACHIEVING THIS GOAL THANK YOU. I BIGGER PREP WHICH YOU KNEW YOUR NAME A COUPLE TIMES SO I APOLOGIZE MISTER ARE INSPIRED CRACK THERE OKAY GOT ME THEY GOT RIGHT FOR. FROM THE. FOUNDER AND CEO OF SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESS MAJORITY PLEASE THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU CO CHAIRS AROUND YOU I'M WOOD AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE. I'M JOHN ARMS MEYER FOUNDER AND CEO SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF MORE THAN THREE POINT EIGHT. MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO OFFER TESTIMONY DAY SUPPORT OF COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES. AND SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE'RE A NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS ADVERSITY ORGANIZATION FOUNDED TWELVE YEARS AGO IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THREE OFFICES IN THE STATE AND SEVEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NETWORK OUT OF FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND NATIONWIDE. WE WERE FOUND IN RUN BY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO ENSURE AMERICA'S. ORDERS ARE A KEY PART. OF A THRIVING ECONOMY. WE ACTIVELY ENGAGE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND POLICYMAKERS IN SUPPORT OF POLICY SOLUTIONS AND WE DELIVER INFORMATION RESOURCES START SHIPPING ORDERS. THAT PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH AND DRIVE A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE JOB CREATING ECONOMY. A KEY PART OF OUR WORK OVER THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. HAS BEEN ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS. ACCESS AFFORDABLE AND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH COVERAGE AND CARE. TODAY I'LL DISCUSS SEVERAL PROPOSALS WE BELIEVE A CRUCIAL TO ENSURING AN EXPANDING THIS ACCESS. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE ACA HAS PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO TWENTY FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS NATIONWIDE WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T ACCESS COVERAGE. MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS OR ARE THEMSELVES BUSINESS OWNERS OR SELF EMPLOYED. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THANKS TO THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAW. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THE ACA ACTUALLY IS TOO SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS STATE. UNFORTUNATELY PRIOR TO THE LOS ENACTMENT SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES CAN PRICE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE WORKING UNINSURED. INDEED IN TWENTY ELEVEN NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION'S UNINSURED WORKERS WERE SELF EMPLOYED OR WORKING AT A COMPANY WITH FEWER THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND WHEN THEY COULD ACCESS HEALTH COVERAGE SMALL BUSINESSES PAID AN AVERAGE EIGHTEEN PERCENT MORE THAN THEIR LARGER COUNTERPARTS. USUALLY FOR LESS COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. DUBBED I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE SINCE THE ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA THE RATE OF INCREASE IN THE SMALL GROUP MARKET HAS DROPPED THE ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASES DROPPED FROM TWENTY TEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. TO FIVE POINT TWO PERCENT THOSE ARE NATIONAL NUMBERS BUT THE NUMBERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT FAR OFF. IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT IS SCIENTIFIC OPINION POLLING WE'VE CONDUCTED LAST YEAR. FOUND THAT SIX INTEND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SUPPORT THE ACA DESPITE ALL OF THE MISREPRESENTATION PARTISAN NOISE. SURROUNDING ITS ENACTMENT AND IMLEMENTATION. THE ACA SO FIRST MEANINGFUL HEALTHCARE REFORM TO HELP ADDRESS THESE NEEDS AND DISPARITIES AND SPEND PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES A SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS. IN PARTICULAR THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLACES BEEN CRUCIAL TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WITH EIGHT POINT SAID EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT OR THREE MILLION SELF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS. PAPER EIGHT PUT A FOUR PERCENT OUT OF THE THREE MILLION SELF WHAT CALIFORNIANS OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND TOTAL ENROLLED IN PLAN THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. COMPARED JUST TWO POINT NINE PERCENT OF ALL WORKERS. EMPLOYEES OF SMALL BUSINESSES. TOTALING FIFTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION IN CALIFORNIA ALSO MORE LIKELY HAVE BENEFITTED FROM ME A CA WITH RUST ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE PERCENT. SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES GAINING COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLACE AND THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE HEALTH THAT'S THIRTEEN PERCENT MEDI CAL EIGHT PERCENT IN COVER CALIFORNIA. THE STATISTICS ILLUSTRATE HOW CALIFORNIA'S BEEN THE LEADER IN ENSURING ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE THANKS TO ITS CREATION OF ROBUST INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE. EASY ENROLLMENT IN THE SMALL GROUP MARKET PLACE RECOVER CALIFORNIA FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND VIGOROUS MARKETING AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS. HOWEVER AS WE'VE HEARD NATIONAL EFFORTS TO CHIP AWAY AT THE HEALTH CARE LAW REPEAL ENTIRELY THREATEN THIS PROGRESS. RECENT PROPOSALS TO UNDO KEY PROVISIONS OF THE ACA THROUGH LEGISLATION AND EXECUTIVE ACTION THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MARKET PLACES AND IN TURN HARM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS. WHAT WE BELIEVE CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ACA CAN AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED UNDERMINING THE A CA ERADICATES HARD WON BENEFITS FOR AMERICA'S ENTREPRENEURS POTENTIALLY CAUSING A RAPID RISE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS? AND CREATING TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN ONCE EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME STATUS DON'T GOVERN ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS AND ITS SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY BY NOW ACTING PRACTICAL ACHIEVABLE REFORMS. THAT WILL STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA'S MARKETPLACES AND PREVENT HUGE INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS WHILE POTENTIALLY LAYING THE GROUNDWORK. TO ACHIEVE THE LONG TERM GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. TODAY I'LL FOCUS ON THREE KEY AREAS. MARKET STABILITY EXPANDED ACCESS TO COVERAGE AND COST AND AFFORDABILITY. FIRST AND FOREMOST STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FEDERAL REPEAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY. STRONG INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLACES VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES. OF. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABLE TO OFFER GROOVE COVERAGE THAT'S HALF OVER HALF OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES. ESPECIALLY FOR THE ROUGHLY THREE MILLION SOLO ENTREPRENEURS IN CALIFORNIA WHO'VE HAD HAD NO THEIR ACCESS TO OF COVERAGE BEFORE THE ACA. THE ABILITY OF SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS AND ENTREPRENEURS TO PURCHASE AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE FROM ALSO RIPPED ROBUST SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMY BY REDUCING JOB BLOCK. ALLOWING WORKERS WHO PREVIOUSLY FELT TIED TO THEIR JOB BY THEIR LARGE EMPLOYER BENEFITS PACKAGE TO STRIKE OUT ON THEIR OWN LAUNCH BRUTAL PATH OR JOIN THRIVING SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS IS WHY CALIFORNIA MUST PURSUE INNOVATIVE STATE SOLUTIONS TO ENCOURAGE YOUNGER HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS TO STAY IN THE SYSTEM WHICH IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE A ROBUST COMPETITIVE AND AFFORDABLE MARKETPLACE. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY WORKS TO STABILIZE RATES DESPITE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING FEDERAL ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO STABILIZE INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE. AS SUCH WE HAVE A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE A HEALTHY A THRIVING MARKET PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES. FIRST WE ENCOURAGE LAWMAKERS TO PURSUE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE RISK POOL. IS ABSOLUTE CRITICAL THE CALIFORNIA REINSTATED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. OF ORDER EQUIVALENT PROVISION TO ENSURE A STABLE HEALTHY MARKETPLACE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ENTREPRENEURS BY ENCOURAGING YOUNG HEALTHY PEOPLE TO JOIN AND REMAIN IN THE SYSTEM WE CAN ALSO PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY FOR EVERYONE. WE ALSO CAUTIONED AGAINST ALLOWING SO CALLED JUNK INSURANCE PLANS THAT DON'T CONFORM TO THE ACA. THESE PLANS WOULD WEAKEN THE LARGER INDIVIDUAL MARKET WHILE FAILING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COVERAGE SPECIFICALLY WE ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION LIKE. SP NINE TEN WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM OFFERING SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION INSURANCE PLANS AND IN SO DOING HELP TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM PLANTS THAT FELT PROVIDE ADEQUATE COVERAGE. TO PROTECT PROTECTOR OF BUSES OF THE SMALL GROUP MARKET CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO PREVENT BUSINESSES FROM FORMING ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING RETAINING THE CURRENT BAN ON NEW MULTIPLE EMPLOYER WELFARE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ME WAS. WELL AGE PEAS AND WE WAS MIGHT NO DOUBT OFFER PLANS WITH LOWER COST FOR SOME SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY LARGELY BENEFIT ENTITIES WITH LARGER HEALTHIER EMPLOYEES THIS CREATES SEPARATE RISK POOLS. CREATING. THE PROBLEM WITH WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE BIFURCATED BALKANIZED MARKETS WE HAVE TO HAVE AS A ROBUST. LARGE ENOUGH MARKET THAT EVERYBODY'S PARTICIPATING AND. HP'S OFF ALSO OFTEN DON'T COVER ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND ARE GOVERNED BY RULES PREVENTING INSURERS FROM CHARGING MORE BASS ENTREE SUCH AS GENDER OR HAVING A PRE EXISTING CONDITION. CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY A LEADER IN PREVENTING ABUSES FROM THESE TYPES OF PLANS AND WE HOPE THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK AGAINST NATIONAL EFFORTS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE OUR STATE PROTECTIONS. SECOND ISSUE IS ACCESS TO COVERAGE. IN ORDER JUST. TO HAVE STABLE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE IS IT'S CRITICAL THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS EMPLOYEES AND SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS HAVE ACCESS THE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA STONE IMPRESSIVE JOB% OF PROMOTING ITS HEALTH CARE OPTIONS BUT PROVIDING ONLINE ENROLLMENT AND COMMUNICATING THE MARKETPLACES BENEFITS THROUGH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. HEARING CALIFORNIA ARE TEAM OF SMALL BUSINESSMEN JORDY HAS CONDUCTED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED WORKSHOPS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. REACHING NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR HEALTH CARE EVENTS AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OVERALL THROUGH OUR FREE HEALTHCARE RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES. BASED UPON OUR EXTENSIVE WORK ON THE GROUND EDUCATING UR STATE SMALL BUSINESSES AND LISTENING TO THEIR NEEDS WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS TO FURTHER EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IS MEDI CAL EXPANDING MEDICAID UNDER THE ACA'S PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES IN THE SELF EMPLOYED. FOR EXAMPLE A RECENT STUDY FOUND AT THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT OF SELF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS AND FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES CAME COVERAGE. THANKS TO MEDI CAL EXPANSION. ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER. OF CALIFORNIA SELF EMPLOYED POPULATION WAS INSURED THROUGH MEDI CAL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND REPEAT ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA SELF INSURE POPULATION ENSURE THROUGH MEDI CAL. WHILE MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS WORKING AT COMPANIES WITH TEN OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. THAT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYERS WERE ENROLLED IN THE SAME EMPLOYEES GIVE ME ROLE IN THE SAME YEAR. YET TWENTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION CALIFORNIA STILL DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OF THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED ONE POINT EIGHT ARE EMPLOYED WITH FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF THEM WORKING AT A COMPANY WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. WHILE ONE IN SIX ARE SELF EMPLOYED. ONE IN THREE OF THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ANNUAL INCOMES BELOW TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MEANING THEY'RE LIKELY FILLED ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. FURTHER EXPANDING MEDICARE ON CONTINUING TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS ABOUT ITS BENEFITS WOULD HELP LOW INCOME SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES AND SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS OBTAIN COVERAGE. ADDITIONALLY WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND MEDICARE ALSO INCLUDE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. EXTENDING THIS COVERAGE WOULD DRASTICALLY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF REMAINING ON IN SHORT IN THE STATE HAS ROUGHLY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE WITHOUT. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL UNINSURED. THESE PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM RUN OR WORK IN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ACCESSING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER WITHOUT ANY WAY TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THEREBY ADDING TO THE INSTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR EVERYONE ELSE. AND LASTLY THERE'S THE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUE OF COST AND AFFORDABILITY. CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATORS MUST MUST PURSUE ADDITIONAL POLICIES AND IMPROVE COSTS IN AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. OUR SCIENTIFIC POLLING HAS SHOWN THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. AND OF THESE RISING COSTS ARE HURTING THE BOTTOM LINE AS A RESULT THEY'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF A NUMBER OF POLICIES THAT AIM TO BRING DRUG COSTS DOWN. IN ADDITION WE ARE POLLING SHOWS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. WE ENCOURAGE LAWMAKERS TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS LIKE A. B. FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN TO ALLOW POOL PURCHASING POWER FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. CALIFORNIA'S LAWMAKERS CAN FREELY FROM FURTHER PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY BY NOW ACTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO SPEND MORE ON HEALTH CARE LESS ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND PROFITS. ONE OPTION IS TO CODIFY MEDICAL LOSS RATIO WENT INTO CALIFORNIA ON A REINFORCES STATE'S COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABILITY. WALKING INTO IT INTO EIGHTY TWENTY RATIO IN CASE FEDERAL LAW LOOSENS ES REQUIREMENT WOULD BE A GOOD FIRST STEP. WE ENCOURAGE FURTHER RESEARCH TO DETERMINE IF A HIGHER RATIOS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE OBVIOUSLY. WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE INSURANCE CAN BE OFFERED BY PRIVATE INSURERS SO. WE DON'T WANNA RATIO IS GOING TO MAKE THAT ON A SUSTAINABLE BUT I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT MAYBE DOING BETTER THAN THE EIGHTY TWENTY RULE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO CONSIDER A PUBLIC OPTION TO ALLOW MEDI CAL TO COMPETE WITH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS IN THE OPEN MARKET. CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO BUY INTO THESE PROGRAMS OF THEIR OWN COSTS WHICH WOULD INCREASE COMPETITION PROVIDE MORE COVERAGE OPTIONS AND HELP LOWER COSTS. ADDITIONALLY THIS TYPE OF PUBLIC PLAN WILL ENSURE THAT ALL AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO COMPETITIVE COVERAGE. ADDITIONAL OPTIONS INCLUDE MAKING PLANS MORE AFFORDABLE PRIVATE BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE PURCHASING SUBSIDIZE PLANS THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY BY INCREASING COPAYMENTS OR COST DURING MEASURES TO THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL A CA SUBSIDIES. CALIFORNIA CAN ALSO PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY BY WORKING TO KEEP PREMIUMS DOWN FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS. S. F. ANY MENTION FIXING THE SO CALLED FAMILY GLITCHES ALSO WAY TO ENSURE MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR EMPLOYEES OF SMALL BUSINESSES MANY OF WHOM CAN'T AFFORD TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO DEPENDENCE. WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROVIDING A STATE SUBSIDY FOR SPOUSES AND DEPENDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO RECEIVE A SUBSIDY THROUGH CLOUD COVER CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE FACT. THE PRIMARY ENSURE FAMILY MEMBER ME SEE EMPLOYEE AFFORDABILITY CENTER ON THE LAW. FINALLY WE ENCOURAGE LAWMAKERS WHO SUPPORT LEGISLATION LIKE S. B. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT THE HEALTHCARE MARKET FAIRNESS ACT. A BILL INTRODUCED IN THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO PROMOTE HOSPITAL CONTRACTING REFORM TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. VERTICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION UNFAIR CONTRACTING A KEY DRIVER OF INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND THE BILL ADDRESSES SOME OF THE MOST COERCIVE PRACTICES BY PROVIDERS. THAT HAVE NO RELATION TO VALUE AND SERVE ONLY TO FUEL A JUSTIFIABLE INCREASES IN PRICE. IN SOME. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT GAINS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND PARTICULARLY TO SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEES. IT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES AND SELF EMPLOYED THANKS IN NO SMALL PART TO A PROACTIVE ATTITUDE CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN TO ESTABLISHING A ROBUST MARKETPLACE IT HAS MADE IT EASY FOR INDIVIDUALS. AND SMALL EMPLOYERS ACCESS AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRESS CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE MARKET STABILITY EXPAND COVERAGE AND MAKE HEALTH CORPS. OR EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE THIS CAN ALL BE DONE IN PARALLEL WITH CONSIDERING. THE MANY OF SUGGESTIONS FOR LONG TERM UNIVERSAL CARE INCLUDING SINGLE PAYER WINTERS LEGISLATOR TO WORK THE LEGISLATURE WORK ON BOTH TRACKS AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BEFORE DANCING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS. THANK YOU HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT CONCISE BUT I'D LOVE TO JUST DRILL DOWN TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF. OF DETAIL FROM WHERE PRESENTATIONS WERE SO STARTING FIRST WITH HELP ACCESS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO EXPAND AFFORDABILITY HELP IN. THE IDEA THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPEND MORE THAN A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME ON PREMIUMS THAT'LL MAKE SENSE TO ME QUESTION YOU DO HAVE SPECIFICS ON THIS. WHAT NUMBERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST? I AM VERY VESTED IN THAT IDEA I THINK. WE COULD WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH BOTH OURCOLLEAGUES AND IN THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY AND IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT I THINK. IF IT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT GETS US. PRETTY CLOSE TO THE WAY THERE THERE IS A BIG THAT GUARANTEE OF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MORE THE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE YOU IF YOU IF YOU'RE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE. IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET YOUR HAVE TO SPEND MORE THE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME. ON PREMIUM. FOR. FOR SILVER LEVEL PLAN IS A IS SOMETHING THAT IS EXTENDED TO FOLKS UNDER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND NINE. I NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS BEFORE OF FAMILY OF FOUR. IT IS. THAT IS THE ISSUE OF THE FAMILY GLITCH FOR THOSE WORKERS IN SOME INTENDED IT IS IS ONE OF THE HOW ARE THE HOLES THAT NEEDS TO BE PLUGGED. THE. THE QUESTION IS. FOR THOSE FOLKS ARE JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT WE DO HAVE DATA THAT SIXTY PERCENT THAT SUGGEST THAT IT. THAT. WHERE THE POPULATIONS THEY TEND IF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT TEND TO BE IN HIGH COST OF LIVING AREAS? AND. AND EIGHT AND OLDER BECAUSE THERE IS AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DOES LIMIT BUT DOES ALLOW FOR THREE TO ONE AGE BAND BETWEEN. THE. BOULDER AND THE PREMIUMS OR AN OLDER PERSON AND THE AND THE YOUNGEST PERSON. THE. SO I THAT WE THINK THAT. IT IS DOABLE TO DO THAT WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL WAS AS ASSISTANT THAT BIT OF THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE COME IN CALIFORNIA BY. SILVER OR BETTER PLANS AND IN FACT AND YOU ENROLLMENT DATA SUGGEST THAT WE EVEN HAD MORE PEOPLE PICKING UP GOLD PANS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE COST SHARING REDUCTION WORK AROUND THAT WAS. DEVELOP I COVER CALIFORNIA INVERT IN LIGHT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ATTACK BUT THE. BUT YOU KNOW FRANKLY WHAT WE WIND WE WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S ALWAYS AFFORDABLE SO THAT EVEN SAID PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO GET TO THAT BRONZE PLAN WHICH IS THAT SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE PLAN WHICH IT YOU YOU KNOW WE WE WANT TO. MAKE SURE THEY'RE AT LEAST THAT THAT'S OVER PLAN WHERE EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE. MOST OF THEIR CARE OUTSIDE OF HOSPITAL CARE IS IS IS COVERED OUTSIDE OF DEDUCTIBLE AS A PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE KEY DID TOO. TO CARE THAT THEY NEED. IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF COSTS I WOULD SAY THAT. WE ARE STILL WORKING ON A NUMBER THE LA ALL GAVE YOU SOME ESTIMATES. ON ON MONDAY AND I YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE KIND OF REFINED AND SEE WHAT KIND OF EFFICIENCIES WE CAN PROVIDE WHAT KIND OF SAVINGS. AN OFFSETTING SAVINGS THERE ARE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF SCALE. THAT YOU'RE QUITE DE YAH I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR DIALOGUE WITH THE LA O. ON MONDAY AND. I WOULD SAY THAT. HOW TO DO THE WHOLE THING ABOUT WITH THE ADDITIONAL? COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THE IN THE HEALTH FOR ALL WE ARE EXPANDING MEDICAL UNDOCUMENTED WOULD BE LESS THAN SAY WHAT WE WHAT WE RAISED UNDER PROP THIRTY. LIKE IT IS A IT IS A. IT IS NOT THE SORT OF THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD HAVE LOST UNDER THE VARIOUS FEDERAL PROPOSALS THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING LAST YEAR LET IT TO IT. IT'S AND IT'S IT'S A SCALE THAT IS DOABLE WE UP THE HOPE THAT WE CAN EVEN MAKE PROGRESS WITHIN THE BUDGET. BUT. BUT BUT TO DO THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME RAISING REVENUES BUT BUT ON A SCALE THAT WOULD BEASTS CERTAINLY MANAGEABLE. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP FOR THAT. YOU TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE PRICES NO UNJUSTIFIED MEDICAL BILLS BEYOND BENCHMARKS DE OF SPECIFICITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THIS SOUNDS LIKE. THE OP HERE CAP IT FROM MARYLAND AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU MEANT THAT TO BE THE CASE BUT CURE SO I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT MODELS ABOUT HOW YOU COULD DO A A HOW YOU COULD DO THIS I THINK YOU COULD LOOK AT. BY YOU AGAIN ESPECIALLY SINCE SO MANY PROVIDERS DO TAKE MEDICARE LOOKING AT THAT AS A AS A AS A STARTING POINT BUT AND THEN SEEING WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDINGLY SIMILAR TO HOW TO SURPRISE MEDICAL BILL LAW THAT. THIS LEGISLATURE ADOPTED NOT TOO LONG AGO DID DID WHERE YOU START WITH A CERTAIN OF BENCHMARK WOULDN'T ALLOW IT DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS TO GO OVER IT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER MODELS AS WELL SO I DID I. I THINK YOU KNOW YOU YOU COULD SEE MARILYN'S ONE MODEL WE CAN GREATER ON CALIFORNIA MODEL BUT THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT. WE WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE WHETHER BY. EIGHT EIGHT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF WHY ARE PRICES SO HIGH AND WHY DO THEY GO UP HIGHER I MEAN AS WE SAID WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. YEAH IT'S WHEN WINDOWS PRICES GO UP BY THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT IT'S NOT LIKE THE. MADE IT MEDICATION BECAME THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE PERCENT MORE EFFECTIVE. SO SO SO THEN. TO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE ISSUE AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WE DO THIS IN THE PUBLIC UTILITY WORLD AS WELL WELL AND YOU KNOW THAT'S AND MAYBE NOT THE PERFECT MODEL BUT. OUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN THERE IS A AYE A CONCENTRATED MONOPOLY FOR IN THE CENTER OR OLIGOPOLY FOR AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE THAT WE'VE IT WE TRY TO SAY OF A DAD. THE OF THE COMPANIES PROVIDING IT CAN. I GET THE THE REVENUE THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND NOW BUT THEY NEED TO JUSTIFY WHAT WHAT WHAT HOW DOES EXPENSES ARE THEN THERE ARE DEBATES UNIT OUT ABOUT. DO OF WITH REGARD TO THE INVESTMENTS THEY MAKE WITH REGARD TO A BUILDING THERE AND WHAT THEY'RE TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK OR CABLE NETWORK OR WHATEVER. I'M JUST ONE COMMENTED ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE ALL OF YOU KNOW I THINK A NUMBER OF YOU KNOW THIS BUT. I'M PREPARED AND I THINK THEIR NUMBER OF US WHO ARE PREPARED TO AUTHOR THAT BILL CHO AUTHOR THAT BILL VOTE ON THAT BILL TODAY. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN YEARS AGO AND. I THINK WE NEED TO A FEW TO GET THAT DONE. NUMBER COUPLE QUESTIONS TO. TO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEMINISTS THINK THINK YOU FOR THAT SURE IF YOU CAN. SO JEWISH ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT WE CONSIDER THE MARYLAND ALL PAYER. RIGHT MODEL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW YOU LAID IT OUT BUT I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS A PROPOSAL COMING FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FAN NO WE WERE. BASICALLY WHAT. WE DID FOR OUR PROPOSAL WAS PUT OUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELS. AND OUR CORE SET OF PRINCIPLES AND SAY THAT WE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW MARYLAND IS A VERY VERY DIFFERENT STATE THING CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO LOOK AT. OUR STATE THAT LEVEL OF MANAGED CARE WE HAVE SOCIETIES THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALS EVERYTHING AND FIND. PERFECT A MODEL THAT FITS OUR STATE AND SO THAT WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. IF I HAD MORE TIME I COULD HAVE GONE INTO A WHOLE LOT MORE EXAMPLES. INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS AND VERMONT AND WEST VIRGINIA. JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. AND ALSO YOU KNOW ANTHONY RAISED UTILITY STYLE. REGULATION THERE'S EXAMPLES IN THE NON HEALTH CARE SPEARS WELL. THAT COULD BE USEFUL AND SO. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THESE PIECES THAT WE HAVE IN ALL OF THE EXPERTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST. WHAT'S THE BEST FIT FOR OUR STATE. OKAY IN I JUST WANTED OBSERVE RIGHT I'VE ABSOLUTE PRECIADO YOUR CORE PRINCIPLES BUILDING TOWARD A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM CONTAINING COSTS INCREASING QUALITY IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES. SIMPLICITY TRANSPARENCY BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PRINCIPLES AND I'D LOVE I THINK WE'D ALL LOVE CHO KIND CONCRETE PROPOSALS COMING FROM. STAKEHOLDER SO THAT WE CAN START SIFTING AND AND COMPARING. ANOTHER QUESTION. ANOTHER QUESTION IS AROUND WHICH OF THESE UP OPTIONS WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL WAIVER SOME ASSUMING PUBLIC OPTION IF WE WERE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PUBLIC OPTION WORLD THAT WOULD REQUIRE A WAIVER. MARILYN APPEAR RATE WOULD REQUIRE I HAVE BEEN READINGDIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THAT NOW WE COULD WE COULD JUST EXPAND THAT HERE. I MEAN IT'S DUBBED THE POINT MY SLIDES IS THAT I. OR YOU WAS TO TRY TO SIFT THROUGH AND PROVIDE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE OPTIONS OF WHAT WE BELIEVE. WHAT IS DOABLE WITHOUT OF FEDERAL APPROVALS BECAUSE? WE ARE CONSISTENT YOU KNOW CONCERNED EVEN PROPOSING SOME APRIL OF A TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME WOULD OPEN THE DOOR THAT WOULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I MEAN AND I. AND I. AND I SAY THIS SOMEBODY WHO WORKING WITH MY FRIENDS AT THE IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER YOU KNOW HAD A THIRTEEN THIRTY TO WAVER YOU KNOW ON. THE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. YOU GO ABOUT TRYING TO OPEN UP COVER CALIFORNIA TO. TO ALL CALIFORNIA'S REGARDLESS IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS WISE TO HAVE WITHDRAWN. THROUGH THAT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO SET THE PRECEDENCE OF WHAT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COULD HAVE DONE WITH THAT SO. NOW. I'M I'M IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THERE MAYBE VERSIONS OF A PUBLIC OPTION OR VERSIONS OF IT ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME FEDERALLY MERRILEES HAVE TO GET THEM AND I MISS. IT DO IT BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE VERSIONS OF IT THAT DO NOT REQUIRE IT AND THAT'S AND AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING SO. IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT ARE PROBABLY VERSIONS OF IT THAT ARE MORE. MORE ROBUST BUT WE DO WE DO THAT WE SEE A PATH WHERE DOES NOT REQUIRED TO SORT OF. THE ROAD BLOCK OF THOSE OF FEDERAL OF PERMISSIONS EITHER ADMINISTRATIVE OR AN ACT OF CONGRESS CONTINENT JUST A FINAL. QUESTION ON TURN AROUND MY BRAIN AROUND SO I THINK WE ALL HEARD A FORMER VERMONT GOVERNOR SHUMLIN. TELL US AND WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM HIM FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO TACKLE COST CONTAINMENT FIRST. AND I I I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT. IN EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY FOR DECADES. WE'VE ALL BEEN TRIED TO COST. AND AND IT'S BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND I KNOW SOMEONE SAID WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK ACOSTA FOR CONSIDERING SINGLE PAYER I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SINGLE PAYER HAS AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION AND HOW YOU TO LOS. AND SO. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT VARIOUS COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS AND HOW WE? PARALLEL TRACK. HOW WE THINK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER VERSUS THINKING ABOUT TACKLING COST CONTAINMENT IF IF IF WE'VE BEEN ALL? I MEAN AT THIS POINT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON PRINCIPLES BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TACKLE COSTS. FOR DECADES SO HOW HO SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT. WHILE OTHER BACK TO WHAT. I GOVERNOR SOMEONE SAID IN THE HEARING. AND IN WHAT I REMEMBER HIM SAYING IS IS THAT. HE WAS SAYING THAT EVEN IN A UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EVEN IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. YOU ARE STILL GONNA HAVE THE RISING PRICES. THE RISING PRICES OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES YOU DEFINITELY GET. UP HUGE ONE TIME AND ONGOING SAVINGS FROM ELIMINATING INSURANCE COMPANIES. GET RID OF THEM AND THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT. YOU STILL HAVE TO REIMBURSE AND PAY HOSPITALS DOCTORS. CAPTION DRUG COMPANIES. AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A EXPLICIT AFFECTED OF ROBUST. COST CONTAINMENT ELEMENT THAT IS PART OF ANY SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THAT. THAT HAS TO BE EXPLICIT. AND SO I THINK THAT SINCE THAT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT PIECE LIKE YOU SAD WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS FOR DECADES UPON DECADES. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND TAKE BOLD ACTION SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AS WE MOVE TO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WHICH RESULTS IN. HAVING TO PAY LAUGHS ON THE PUBLIC SIDE. BECAUSE IT WE MOVED TO A PUBLICLY FINANCED SYSTEM. WORK THERE'S MONEY COMING FROM SOMEWHERE SOMEONE PACE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS AT A REASONABLE AND SUSTAINABLE RATE. BUT ISN'T ANY PART OF THE VISION A SINGLE PAYER AND I'M AND I'M TRULY OBVIOUS EPONA SUPPORTER SINGLE PAYER BUT I'M THE ONE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE. PART OF THE COST SAVINGS IS FROM WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BUT PART OF THE COST SAVINGS COMES FROM. THE CLERK TO PURCHASING POWER OF A SINGLE PAYER AND HOW THEY NEGOTIATE WITH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. AND FORMA AND OTHER ACTORS IN THE SYSTEM SO HOW DO YOU IT HURT YOU MODEL THAT IF YOU. BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY MODEL THAT IN AYE IN A IN A SEPARATE COST CONTAINMENT EFFORT THAT IS NOT TIED TO SEE. I'M. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THAT YOU KNOW. IT. S. AS SUPPORTERS A SINGLE PAYER THE THAT PART OF IT IS THE GETTING RID US OF. DONE THE MIDDLE. DOES TO ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRACY SIMPLIFYING THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES BUT BUT STILL EVEN IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE STILL LIKE AGAIN EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR COSTS ARE DOCTORS HOSPITALS DRUG COMPANIES EXIT <u>&lt;c.green&gt; IF THE PLUS OF</u> ARM. POLY NINETY EIGHTY WERE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT OF SO THE QUESTION IS THIS UNIT PRICE ISSUE. AND AGAIN I THINK. THOUGH THE WAY THAT IT THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS HAS TRIED IS IS THROUGH COMPETITION BUT THERE IS OF IT ALLY AND. THE THREE WAYS THAT YOU TRY TO DO IT THIS IS COMPETITION NEGOTIATION OR OF REGULATION. BY THE THAT COMPETITION IS NOT WORK PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. CONSUMERS PURCHASERS WHETHER THEY BE BUSINESS OR LABOR DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY NO. RIGHT IF YOU HEALTH CARE YOU YOU'RE JUST NOT AND IF IT DID I YOU'RE NOT IN THE SPACE TO DO THAT AND CUTS AND CLASSIC MORE HOUSE. RIGHT EXACTLY AND IF IT IS NOT A. AND IT'S ALSO SUCH A CONSOLIDATED FEEL THAT THAT ARE THERE ARE MORTGAGE. IT AT AT BEST MARKET FAILURES SO THEN THE QUESTION IS. WHAT OTHER MECHANISM DO YOU USE TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT AND REVIEW VIEW OF OVER PRICES AND? THE. THE AND WHETHER IT'S IN A SINGLE NOW IN THE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM OR A MULTI OF THE PAYERS SYSTEM. THEY USE EITHER THOUGH THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THE REGULAR TO. TORY PARA THE GOVERNMENT TO DO TO PUT TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT AND TO THEN AND THE COURT THE QUESTION IS CAN WE BILL THAT. MECHANISM EVEN ABSENT SOME OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS AS A AS A STEP ESTEPONA AS LIKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU WOULD NEED FOR THE FOR. AYE BUT OVERALL SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THAT THAT'S WHERE. JUST LEGISLATURE OTHER OR FUTURE LEGISLATORS DECIDE TO GO THE. I MEAN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT IN THE FIVE SIX TWO PROPOSALS TERRACE AS YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT FIVE SIX TWO WE PUT ON OUR SCORECARD. ON BUT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD WAS ARMED THAT IT BUILDS THIS GREAT PURCHASING POOL OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. BUT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ID SPELLED OUT THE EXACT MECHANISM OF HOW. IT WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A FORMULARY AND I AND I KNOW THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION THE EARLIER PANEL ABOUT. IS ENVISIONED ARE NOT HER OI EATS IT'S NOT SPELLED OUT AGAIN. DISPENSERS ARE CLEAR THAT THEY DID DILLON DID NOT GO INTO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DETAIL WITH AND THAT'S WHERE THE DETAILS ARE ABOUT HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE TO THE DRUG COMPANIES GET TO THIS GET TO DECIDE. IF YOU IF YOU'RE SETTING UP A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM AND SAYING YOU'RE COVERING EVERY DRUG. IN THE DRUG COMPANIES WILL THEN SAY TIME WILL CHARGE WHATEVER WE WANT UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME SORT MECHANISM AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FORMULARIES BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS IT. TO THEN BE ABLE TO AND TOOK TO MAKE THAT NEGOTIATING POWER HAPPEN AND SO YOU NEED TO CREATE A MECHANISM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE'RE SUGGESTING. I DID YEAH THAT WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT PROJECT. POST HASTE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED IT REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO. OKAY. NUMBER ONE. FINAL QUESTION WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK ABOUT CHINA BRING BACK AN INDIVIDUAL MAN TO CALIFORNIA I NOTICED THAT WAS NOT. MENTION IN ANY THE PROPOSAL'S SO FARMS. SO I I'M ACTUALLY I THINK I'D GO I THINK YOU DID YEAH AND ITALY TO I MEAN ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THAT. MARKETS ARE MOST STABLE AND COST SPREAD OUT ARE. MINIMIZED THEY'LL COST INCREASE OR MINIMIZE THE MOST WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM. SO I'VE WHATEVER LEGAL. WAIT THEY CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM WE ALL KNOW A MANDATE A PENALTY DOESN'T SURE EVERYBODY'S IN THE SYSTEM. EVEN THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO. IT IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL IN THE ARSENAL. AND. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NATIONWIDE WITH A MANDATE BEING PULLED BACK. BUT ABSOLUTELY IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT. THAT REQUIREMENT CAN BE IN PLACE AND CAN HAVE SOME IMPACT ON PEOPLE JOINING THE SYSTEMATICALLY YOUNGER HEALTHIER PEOPLE BUT WE THINK THAT HELPS BRING DOWN COSTS STABILIZE MARKETS. AND IN HEALTHAXIS AND I WOULD I WOULD I AS A SUDDEN IN MY PRESENTATION THAT HAPPY TO REPEAT THE. I THINK WE THINK THAT THE AND NUMBER ONE DRIVER OF. ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN THE SUBSIDIES NOT A PENALTY THAT THAT HAS BEEN WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET CITED CITY IT'S THE IT'S THE PARENTS NOT TO STICKS. AND SO WE DO THINK THAT. ARE TO STABILIZE THE MARKETS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE IMPACTS OF THE REPEAL OF THE MANDATE WHICH THE CBO SCORED AT A TECH YOU KNOW IT EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. WHICH ARE UC BERKELEY ESTIMATED WOULD LEAVE ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN. MILLION CALIFORNIANS. WROTE OVER ARE LOSING COVERAGE. AND THE IMPACTS OF THAT INCLUDING FOLKS WHO MAIN WHO MAY DECIDE NOT TO SIGN UP FOR MEDI CAL OR OTHER PRO PROGRAMS AS A RESULT. THAT HAVING AN AFFORDABILITY PACKAGE THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO ENROLLED IF IT IS. ARE IN PART FUNDED BY A CONTRIBUTION BY INDIVIDUALS TO ADD TO YOUR WHO WHO ARE NOT PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM. THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF WE THINK THAT THAT CALIFORNIA COULD COULDN'T SHOULD DESIGNED ONE THAT'S MAYBE MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN WHAT THE WHAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROPOSED. WE ALSO THINK THAT THE. THE MECHANISM OF HAVING. JUST THE PROMPT. AT. AT TAX TIME IS JUST A HELPFUL ENCOURAGEMENT TO REMIND PEOPLE TO TO GET COVERED SO THEY DON'T THEY ARE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES. AS THE COVER CAL COUPLING A COMMERCIAL HAD YOU KNOW ON THE ROOF PUTTING UP THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN. IN A HAVING A AT IT AND HAVING OF A MOMENT AT THE E. ARE. THAT. THAT I DIED THERE ARE IT IT IS THERE'S INTO USEFUL KNOWLEDGE TO GET FOLKS THERE BUT I THINK THE THE PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE ON AFFORDABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE KIND OF. I'M JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT WHICH IS I FEAR MUCH APPRECIATE. YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND AND I'VE HAD MEETINGS I THINK WITH ALMOST ALL OF YOU IN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS TO TALK THROUGH. UP OPTIONS. I THINK FOR US WE'RE ALL STILL LOOKING FOR THAT NEXT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY AROUND PROPOSALS. ARM AND AND I KNOW THERE BEEN A LOT OF. THERE BEEN A LOT OF SHOTS TAKEN AT AT THAT FOR SIXTY TWO FOR SOME LEVELS OF ON SPECIFICITY BUT I WOULD SAY IN THE OTHER HAND. WE'RE ALSO JUST WAITING FOR OTHER IDEAS AND IF WE AND IN THE ABSENCE OF IDEAS WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE THAT THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU HAD WANTED TO PARTICIPATE. IN TODAY'S PANEL BUT IT'SVERY NOTICEABLE THAT THERE ARE MANY PLAYERS THAT HAVE NOT OFFERED PROPOSALS. AND I SAY THIS WITH GREATEST RESPECT AS A SON OF A DOCTOR TO THE DOCTORS TO HOSPITALS TO INSURERS TO PHARMA. THERE SO MANY OTHER PLAYERS IN THIS WE NEED EVERYONE. TO EITHER GIVE US YOUR BEST IDEAS OR OR OR OR OR OR HELP US FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A. LOTS OF GOOD DISCUSSION. SOURCE ABOUT THE FORMULAS CONCERT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD. WE. YOU KNOW WILL ISSUE OF EXCESS ACCESS AND TREATMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS THAT. COMES UP AGAINST THE FORMULARY. REMAIN A PROBLEM ONGOING IF WE MOVE TO ANOTHER SYSTEM. REASONING BECAUSE. IN I BELIEVE THE DOCTORS SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME WHAT TREATMENT THE PATIENTS GET BUT ALL THAT'S KIND OF UNHEARD OF IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND WILL BE UNHEARD OF IN A NEW SYSTEM I MEAN HOW DO ENVISIONED IT BECAUSE COST CONTROL IS AN ISSUE. BUT YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS ADVOCATED THAT IF YOU GET THE BEST TREATMENTS OF FRONT YOU ACTUALLY CAN SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATION RATES. JUST YOU KNOW COMMUNITY VIRAL LOAD IF IT'S AN ISSUE OF. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PATIENTS A CORRECTION MAYBE GO BACK TO WORK NOT HAVE TO HAVE A TRANSPLANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN WHERE WILL THIS NEW SYSTEM FALL AND MAYBE IN THOSE BUSINESSES CHOOSE SAY WE WOULD NEED SPECIFICITY BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO BRASS TACKS THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE YOUR DECISIONS. IF WE JUST HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW THAT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS. I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IN TERMS OF. I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BROADEST MAD ABOUT ACCESS A CARE THAT IS. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE MY ORGANIZATION IS AND YOU KNOW THE NAME OF ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH ACCESS WE FOUGHT FOR. EVERYTHING OPERATE YOU KNOW FOR EACH MO PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS OVER A DECADE AGO TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TONIGHT MEDICALLY NECESSARY CHAIR THAT DATA ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW TO. EARLIER WAS. WAS THE RESULT OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DENIED FROM FROM MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. THAT THERE THAT THERE WAS AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS SO THAT PEOPLE IT. DOT DOES ENSURE CHINA'S COMPANIES ARE OVERTURNED WHEN THEY ARE DONE. DENYING THAT CARE. NOT TO SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS ENTIRELY SOLVE BUT THAT THAT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE JUSTICE THEY NEED. AND THE CARE THAT THEY NEED I THINK IN TERMS OF AYE AND WHETHER IT IS WITH MARTIN NETWORKS WHETHER YOU WHETHER IT'S REGARD TO FORMULARIES I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS THE BALANCE I DO. THINK ARE THERE IS ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN THAT AND IN THE IN THE REALM OF COST CONTROL BECAUSE WE ALSO AS A CONSUMER ADVOCATE I ALSO. THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE. A MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO COULD TO BARGAIN FOR THE BEST PRICE AND FOR THE BEST QUALITY. THAT IF THERE IS A PROVIDER OR A HOSPITAL OR WHATEVER THAT IS PROVIDING PARTICULARLY POOR QUALITY THAT THERE IS A MECCA IT OF OUR OR. OR LOW QUALITY HIGH COST CARE THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM TO STE STEER OF. PATIENTS AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IN ANYBODY'S INTEREST. INCLUDING THE PATIENTS UPDATE IF THERE IS THAT CASE AND SO. THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS A ROW OF ONLY A ROLE FOR THOSE MECHANISMS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. NEEDS THAT ARE HE'S REPLACED OUT IT SHOULDN'T BE DRIVEN BY PROFIT IT SHOULDN'T BE DID I DROVE DRIVEN BY THE. OF BY THE NEEDS OF ENSURE YOUNG ADVENTURERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IT SHOULD BE IN A YOU KNOW POKE PUBLIC IN OPEN PROCESS SEIZE AND THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. WE WE WOULD LIKE A WELL DESIGNED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BUT. AND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL AS WE ARE. TAKE A STEPS FOR COST CONTROL BUT WE DON'T. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE DON'T THINK THAT THE ISSUE OF COST. SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON QUALITY ARE ACCESS AGAIN IT IT'S THIS UNIT IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE USED HIM. IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE USE TOO MUCH HEALTH CARE AND. IT'S IT'S BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND SO THE MORE WE HAD ADDRESS JUST WHY THAT UNIT PRICES SO HIGH A WHITE GOES UP AT IN THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE RATE. I I DID THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO AND THAT WE SHOULD GET TO AND IMMEDIATELY. AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. EVEN DESPITE SOME THE OTHER OBSTACLES THAT EXIST. I'M WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MARYLAND'S A LITTLE BIT AND I HAD PULLED MY NOTES FROM THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS ALL WE HAD MARILYN AND THE COST CONTROL WAS THE TOPIC. AND YOU KNOW I FULLY AGREE IF ANYTHING THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THE COST BEFORE WE JUST CARRY THE BAGGAGE. YOU KNOW WITH US TO OF ANY OTHER SYSTEM.ONE OF THE THINGS MARILYN DID AND YOU KNOW TRYING TO. REFILL MY OWN NOTES HERE. WAS. THEY COMBINE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY LOOK AT PRICE THEY LOOK AT UTILIZATION ALSO SO THAT KIND OF CONTROLLING ON BOTH ENDS. AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ON PART OF IT BECAUSE THEY SAID INSTEAD OF INCREASEDLIKE HOW IT IS CURRENTLY THE MORE PEOPLE THAT COME IN THE MORE MONEY THAT'S MADE BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM MORE PEOPLE PAYING. BUT SO INSTEAD OF INCREASING UTILIZATION RATES TO MAKE MORE MONEY THE PROGRAM WILL SIMPLY INCREASE THEIR BUDGET BY GREAT OF GROWTH EVERY YEAR. ON THE IS AN EXAMPLE OF SIZE TWO PERCENT YOU HAVE THERE BEEN SO MANY MORE PEOPLE IT'S INCREASE OF BODIES THIS AMOUNT. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN SO IT'S NOT BASED ON THE UTILIZATION IS JUST MONEY CAPPED. AND IT'S AN EFFORT TO REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION MISTAKES THEY'RE SAYING READMISSIONS INFECTIONS SPREAD AT CENTER BECAUSE THE BUDGET CAP BUT. MY CONCERN IS. THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING CARE. THIS YOU CAN ONLY SQUEEZE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ON THE BUDGET. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT WAS IF. A SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY EXCEEDING AND THEY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES AND METALLICA WAY TO LOWER AND YOU KNOW. PEOPLE GETTING KILLED THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFECTION RATES THERE'S A BONUS AIDED. AS AN ENSIGN OF. YOU KNOW AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS IF MORTALITY RATES ARE HIGH OR THEY'RE NOT TAKING CARE PEOPLE OR THEY HAVE MORE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS. WOULD THERE BE CUTS OF FINES. TO INCENTIVIZE STAYING WITHIN THE CAP I. I'M JUST GOING THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE THAT IS. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MARILYN THE COSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OF. FOR THEM I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON MARYLAND I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THE NEXT HEARING SHOULD MAYBE BE IN MARYLAND. BUT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF. WHY MARYLAND HAD A KIND OF TWO POINT KNOW? THAT SYSTEM WHY THEY WANTED TO ADD THE. BUDGET CAP WAS THAT WOULD IS KINDA GOING BACK TO THE BALLOON ANALOGY THAT I USE THEY WERE JUST LOOKING THEIR SYSTEM WAS ALL PAYER RATE SETTING. BUT IT WAS ONLY LOOKING AT HOSPITALS. AND ONLY LOOKING AT PRICES AND SO THEY WERE SQUEEZING ON PRICES. IN HOSPITALS AND THEN OVER TIME SINCE THE SEVENTIES THERE'D BEEN A COUPLE JUST SHIFTS IN THE MARKET THERE WAS MORE. CARE MOVING TO OUTPATIENT SETTINGS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY PRICE CONTROLS ON IT. AND MARYLAND. HAD AN OVERALL INCREASE I'VE BY AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH UTILIZATION THE IT REALLY HIGHER RATES OF RE ADMISSIONS AND HOSPITAL. ACQUIRED INFECTION. SO. THERE WASN'T MAYBE THE QUALITY AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU HAVE VERY HIGH UTILIZATION BUT. POOR QUALITY YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE GREAT HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SO I THINK WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WAS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SOMETIMES ADVOCATES CALL THE TRIPLER THE QUADRUPLE AIM. IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU CONTAINING COSTS IN TERMS OF PRICES AND UTILIZATION BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IMPROVING QUALITY. AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. AND SOMETIMES IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS MEANS. DECREASING UTILIZATION BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT OVER DIAGNOSIS OR. INAPPROPRIATE CARE. AND SOMETIMES IT MEANS INCREASING UTILIZATION BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THOSE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE GETTING THE PREVENTIVE CARE THAT THEY NEED THAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR DIABETES MEDICATION THAT. THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP AT THE ER FOR THESE VERY EXPENSIVE TREATMENT SO IT'S. YOU KNOW AS AS THE THE CHAIRS AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOW IT'S A VERY KIND OF. COMPLEX DELICATE BALANCE THAT I THINK THAT MARYLAND'S TWO POINT NO WAS TRYING TO GET AT THAT. AND I AM TOTALLY NOT EXPERT AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE TOTALLY SEEN THE RESULTS I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE. HAVE KIND OF WHAT CAME OUT OF THERE THEIR EXPERIMENT. THANK YOU SEE YOU KNOW THE BOMBERS PUT MY HOPE. OKAY JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS BECAUSE THEY FEEL A NEED TO SAY SOME THINGS ON THE RECORD. SO WE WERE TOUTING YOU KNOW HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN ROLLED WITH COVER CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW IT'S. FAR EXCEEDING THE NATURE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF GETTING PEOPLE INTO COVERAGE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU COMBINE. WE. NEED MEDI CAL MEDICARE COVER CALIFORNIA THE INDIVIDUAL THOSE ON COMMERCIAL WERE AT ABOUT NINETY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THE FOLKS THAT COVERED AS WE KNOW. AND THEN WE HAVE ABOUT THREE MILLION YOU KNOW UNDERINSURED OR NOT INSURED AT ALL. AND WE'VE KIND OF IDENTIFIED I THINK ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES OF IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP RISING UP TO THE SURFACE WHICH IS. THE UNNECESSARY SERVICES THE NON INSUREDS AND DENIALS. UNDER INSURED BARACK OR SEE MALPRACTICE THE STREAMLINING I MEAN. NO COST CONTAINMENT. IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED ACCESS ALWAYS ACCESS. WHY THE BUT? IT'S JUST AN OPEN QUESTION AS. WHY? WOULD WE DISCARD WHAT WE'VE DONE WHICH IS NINETY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT COVERAGE. RATHER THAN FOCUS ON. SOLVING SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW MAYBE WE CAN GET A HANDLE ON A FOR YOU. DID THAT RATHER AND START A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM TRYING TO GO AND GET THESE WAIVERS WITH AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS CLEARLY NOT GONNA BE. FAVORABLE THE CALIFORNIA THAT COULD TAKE YEARS THAT. MAYBE LEAVE FOLKS KIND OF. YOU KNOW NEEDING CARE ENOUGH GETTING INTO. THIS IS A OPEN QUESTION. CAN. IS THAT NOT DOABLE. SO WHENEVER I WOULD AGREE THAT. THE PERSON WE NEED TO DO IS FIX WE CAN FIX AND SHORT THE CV WITH MADE TREMENDOUS GAINS OF THE ACA I ALSO AGREE WITH ANTHONY THAT. A ROBUST AND FUNCTIONING SYSTEM BASED UPON THE ACA IS CAN BE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM I DON'T THINK. BY WORKING ON THAT WERE MOVING AWAY FROM A LONG TERM SOLUTION I MEAN AS SOARING REPRESENTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO THINK IT IS A CRAZY QUILT SYSTEM I'M WELL YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL. OF HIS ARMS UP TO TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW TO LEARN ABOUT IT WILL MAKE IT OFF FROM WHAT I CAN OFFER NOW THEY DON'T OFFER THEIR EMPLOYEES. YOU KNOW HAVE THE CHOICE OF GOING TO THE INDIVIDUAL EXCHANGE OF OR MAYBE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL I MEAN THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T. PROMOTE ALL THAT GOES ARE ALL OPTIONS IT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE. BUT I DO THINK THAT. BY DOING THAT. WE'VE SOLVED NAM WE DO OUR BEST TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS AND THEN WE ALSO PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION. TO SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU KNOW WORK ON POTENTIAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WHICH TO HAVE FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY SO DON'T THINK IT'S ONE VERSUS THE OTHER. AND I IT AND AND I WOULD AGREE I DON'T I. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE. THE DIALECTIC OF A CA VERSES OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM I BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE ALL WITHIN A IT OUT ALL WITHIN THE SPECTRUM AND THAT THE ACA DID. IT GET US CLOSER TO. A CLOSER TO AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND EXPANDING YOU KNOW JUST GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE INTO THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN EXPANDING PUBLICLY FINANCED COVERAGE IN IN PROVIDING THOSE. OF OLD PROVIDING ADDITIONAL JUST RESOURCES THAT IS THAT COULD BE IF IF IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER. WERE ARE PUT PUT FOR AS A DOWN PAYMENT TO THE FINANCING OF A BROADER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR DEFINING WHAT THE TERM COVERAGE IS AND WHAT IT YOU KNOW WHAT WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS. AND AND AND SETTING A STANDARD FOR THAT PUTTING LIMITS AND AND MAXIMUMS FOR CO PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES EVEN IF WE THINK THAT THEY'RE TOO HIGH THAT AT LEAST PUT PUT SOME DEFINITIONS AND STRUCTURES IN PLACE. THAT THEN OF WE CAN ADJUST GOING FORWARD. IE IS AND I THINK IF WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH REGARD TO COST WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT ARE ON OUR OUTSTANDING IN OF IT WHETHER IT'S THE ISSUE OF SHOULD ARE ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDED REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AS BETSY WAS TALKING ABOUT OR WHETHER IT'S THE ISSUE. IF IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT'S ONE LESS ISSUE THAN AND WE. AT HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH THE WITH THE NEXT STEP THAT. IN IN REFORMING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF WE CAN DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF OF YOU KNOW DISH YOU KNOW. A GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN COVERAGE. THAT'S JUST YOU ARE DEAD THAT MEANS THAT JUST NARROWS AND NARROWS THE FURTHER GAPS I DON'T. WE'D. WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE DECISION EITHER OR THIS IS A CONTINUUM AND WE. WHERE LONGEST CONTINUE AND WE UNDER AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE? SOME PEOPLE ON THE DICE THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES OF WHERE YOU WANT TO END UP ON THAT CONTINUUM. AND AND AND SO I WE HOPE THAT LIKE A THAT AGENDA ON COST CONTAINMENT IS SOMETHING. YOU KNOW LIKE. LIKE THE WORK THAT WE DID LAST YEAR ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS SOMETHING THAT FAX INTEREST FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IT EVEN IF YOU DON'T I'LL BUY INTO THE FACT THAT THAT AND THAT IS. I TAKES US ALL THE WAY TO A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I DON'T THINK YOU I THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT THE NEXT COUPLE OF STEPS. EVEN IF WE'RE NOT ALL THE EVEN IF YOU DON'T BUY INTO WHERE'D WHERE'D ALL IS BECAUSE THAT CAN AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE BUY BIT ARE. AND HOW YOU MAY DO YOU MAY DECIDE THAT THE THE VIEW IS IS IS OKAY AT. NEXT LEVEL THE MOUNTAIN WHERE OTHERS WANT TO KEEP CLIMBING TO THE TOP. WELL THANK YOU THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL WANT TO HAVE A. PAGE PATIENTS SOMEONE THAT SOMETIMES SLIPS THROUGH THE CRACKS SO I I'M GONNA WHO BY LIKE FOUR QUESTIONS INTO ONE THE FIFTH. SAKE OF TIME THIS IS ONE NO ONE'S GONNA LIKE BUT I JUST NEED TO SAY IS. WILL LOOK TO VERMONT. THREE YEARS AGO THEY HAD TO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR SINGLE PAYER. A NEW NO PLAN THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THE HEAD A BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW ON TWENTY ELEVEN. BECAUSE THE INCOME AND PAYROLL TAXES HAD TO GO UP SO MUCH NOW VERMONT IS A LOT SMALLER THAN CALIFORNIA SO THAT COULD HAVE BEEN. PART OF THE ISSUE THERE. COLORADO VOTERS VOTERS REJECTED A SINGLE PAYER PLAN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY. A RATIO. THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR HAD TO URGE HIS OF VOTERS NOT TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE OF A DOUBLE THE STATE BUDGET. THEN WE LOOKED WE DID HAVE A LOT HEARINGS WITHOUT THAT OTHER STATES WITH THEIR DOING WOULD LOOK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH WAS ACTUALLY FASCINATING AND VERY. INFORMATIVE. LIST THEM WE SAW THE SCALE OF HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING AND HOW MUCH LESS WE YET VERSUS OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN YOU LOOK THAT AND THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES NORMALLY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE. HOW? THE ONES THAT SEEM TO WORK THE BEST ACTUALLY HAD. MORE PAYER OPTIONS THEY ACTUALLY HAD PRIVATE. PLANS MIXED IN WITH THE GOVERNMENT PLANS. THOUGH SEEM TO BE THE ONES THAT WERE REALLY THE STRONGEST. AND YOU KNOW I PARKS I'VE. I DON'T A LOT OF STUDY ON IT. CAME UP WITH THERE WAS A STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE OF THIS AND ANY OVER TWO DECADES TO ALL SPECIALTIES TWELVE PROVINCES. IN CANADA. AND IT LOOKS AT WAIT TIMES IT'S A BIG SERVICES SOMEONE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND IT'S SHOWING THAT. TO SIT FROM APART FROM GETTING TO A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR BEING REFERRED FOR TREATMENT TO A SPECIALIST THEY AVERAGES TWENTY ONE. POINT TWO WEEKS OF WEIGHTS. THAT'S OVER FIVE MONTHS IN CANADA. DISK TO GO FROM A GENERAL PRACTITIONER TO TREATMENTS AT A SPECIAL IT FOR I AM OPHTHALMOLOGY. ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS. AND IT IS THE. DONE BY THE FRAZIER INSTITUTE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNLESS IT'S ALL HERE. A. I'M JUST I'M POINTING THIS OUT SO MAYBE IF THERE'S DATA THAT PROVE IT'S NOT RIGHT WHEN ONE HERE. OUR ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY OVER A TEN MONTH WAIT. AND AS I SAID BEFORE MY RELATIVES COME FROM CANADA THEY HAVE THEY BOUGHT SUPPLEMENTAL PLANS BECAUSE. THEY WERE YOU KNOW HAD MORE MONEY. THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IT MUCH ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE VOTE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN. SO HOWELL WE ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND YOU KNOW IS WE KNOW FOR THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BRING IT UP WHEN I WANT TO GO DOWN THE. HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA? WHAT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE OF WE'RE? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS AS IT IS NOW. PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THE PLAN THROUGH THEIR TAXES THAT BY YOU KNOW SOMETHING THE SALES TAX WILL PAY FOR IT. SO THE NOT ACTUALLY PAYING WHEN THEY GET THERE. IT'S CONSIDERED FREE IF THEY THINK IT'S FREE SO THAT I USE IT MORE THEY'LL BE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM MORE THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE SEEN IN ALL THESE PLACES. HOW OLD? TO. AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THE WAIT TIME ISSUE HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT THAT'S THAT'S OF. HONEST QUESTION AND THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION. SO I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE I YOU WERE. HAPPY TO PROVIDE OUR. EVIDENCE I'D IT WE I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN. ANECDOTALLY OR EVIDENCE OF IN A CANADIANS COMING TO AMERICA FAR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT IS. IF ANYTHING IT'S IF IF ANYTHING IT'S THE. IT'S THE REVERSE BUT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW DID TO YOU. I DO THINK I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO BEEN SHOPPING GOING ON IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM PEOPLE. IT YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE GO AYE THEY. IT THEY NEED TO GO CARE IF NOBODY'S IDEA OF A GOOD TIME TO GO THE ER. AND SO EIGHT SO I. ARE THERE ARE MECHANISMS TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO PRIMARY CARE RATHER THAN EMERGING. EMERGENCY ROOMS ABSOLUTELY AND AND WE THINK THE KEY THING IS TO PROVIDE THOSE URGENT CARE AND PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER OPTIONS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN. YOU KNOW GET THE CARE THEY NEED IN THE APPROPRIATE PLACE RATHER THAN USE THE E. ARE APPROPRIATELY BUT I'D. I AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY OR. I DID DESIRES TO DO THAT THERE'S AND THERE ARE EXISTING SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR THE QUOTE UNQUOTE FREQUENT FLYERS. OF PEOPLE WHO DO SHOW UP OCCASIONALLY FOR SPECIFIC ARE ISSUES BUT THOSE TEND TO BE IN ISSUES MORE ABOUT OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND ABOUT YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE APPROPRIATE. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER TYPES OF OF. SERVICES IN PLACE AND I THINK THE DATA ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT IN FACT A LOT OF. THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE ARE A LOT OF OUR. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A VERY HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS AMERICA'S BECAUSE WE HAVE OF WE ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVELY LOW INVESTMENT IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AND AND SO THAT AND SO IT IT IT IT IT'S REFLECTED. IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A RESULT AND I AND I THINK AND THAT MAYBE GOES TO THIS OUR. OUR OTHER QUESTION OF. WITH REGARD TO THE. IT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF CANDOR THAT I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY CALIFORNIA WILL CREATE ITS OWN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN CANADA THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT THAT YOU KNOW IT WILL BE A CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WE CAN. PUT IN PLACE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ABOUT WAIT TIMES EXCEPT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOME OF THAT IT WITH OUR EXISTING SYSTEM WITH STANDARDS WITH REGARD TO TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. AND OTHER OF PIECES AND WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN WHATEVER SYSTEM WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WAS ONE OF OUR OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT FIVE SIX TWO WAS WHAT WAS JUST MAKING SURE THAT. THE STANDARDS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO HOLD THE INSURERS ACCOUNTABLE TO. IN OUR IN OUR CURRENT LAW WHICH SOMETIMES THEY DON'T ABIDE BY AND THEY GET FINED FOR. ARE IN PLACE FOR WHATEVER IT WHAT WHATEVER OUR SYSTEM IS AND AND AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE BUT. YOU KNOW THAT WILL BE A DECISION BASED ON AT LEAST. A THAT PROCESS THAT IS DETERMINED BY ELECTED DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES RATHER THAN BY INSURERS. IN A PRIVATE BOARD ROOM. YOU KNOW I WANT TO START MY COMMENTS TODAY IF I CAN BY. REMEMBERING WHERE WE CUT OUR TEETH AND HOW WE LEARNED TO BECOME ADVOCATES. I WAS MOVED BY THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WHICH STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AFTER. I BELIEVE THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN. AND. I ALSO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HEALTH FOR ALL. AND REALLY BELIEVES THAT THAT GOAL IS A NOBLE ONE. AND BOTH WANT TOBE FOCUS OF I CAN ON THREE MAIN AREAS. FIRST. I'D LIKE BETTER INFORMATION IF I CAN FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AS WELL AS HEALTH ACCESS REGARDING THE FAMILY GLITCH. HOW COULD WE BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR FAMILIES AND WHAT COULD WE DO TO IMPROVE UPON THAT? SECOND I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP. BOTH IN TERMS OF STABILIZING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LOOK AT INCREASES. AND BUT IF YOU COULD FURTHER EXTRAPOLATE WHAT RAISING THIS AMOUNT WOULD DO FOR US AS CALIFORNIANS AND HOW THAT WOULD HELP US. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THE UNDER INSURED. THAT'S AN AREA THAT REALLY TOUCHES HOME TO ME. WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT. TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IS GOING TOWARD HEALTH CARE I'M REMINDED THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHO DON'T MAKE TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND WANTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO AS A STATE. TO HELP IN PAYING FOR THOSE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING SO WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS WITHIN OUR STATE. TO REALIZE THE SUCCESSES. OUT OF TAKE A COUPLE OF THESE. BUT NOT NOT ALL OF THEM SO I'M FOR THE FAMILY WHICH I MEAN THAT AND AS I SAID THAT PARTICULARLY. HERTZ SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TEND TO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE A PLEA ONLY WHEN THEY DO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE MORE MORE OFTEN EMPLOYEE ONLY THEN LARGER. ORGANIZATIONS BUSINESS I HAVE CLIENTS THAT OFTEN INCLUDE DEPENDENCE. I'M NOT SURE I WOULD DEFER TO EXPERTS HERE I'M NOT SURE THAT. IT WE AND OTHER WORDS I THINK THAT FEDERAL. YOU BET WE CAN INCREASE THE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES ON AROUND YOU KNOW TO TO COVER. DEPENDENCE OF. THE WHO WERE LATER POLICE THAT HAVE PLANTS WHERE THEY MEET THE AFFORDABILITY STANDARD. SO I THINK IT WOULD REQUIRE FUNDING I MEAN AT THIS BE CLEAR AND SO AND THAT'S A DECISION ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE WITH THE SURPLUS THAT EXISTS OF YOU KNOW THERE'S A MILLION PLACES RIGHT MONEY CAN GO. ON IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR. EMPLOYEES OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE HAVE DEPENDENTS WHERE THE BUSINESSES HAVE STRUGGLED OFFER THE PLANS TO STORM OFF REPEAT CAN'T AFFORD OFFER. DEPENDENT COVERAGE SO ON THE POINT THAT OUT FROZEN ROLLERS CONCERN I MEAN JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME SANITY IN PLACE AND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE ROAD TO THE RICH MORE PROPOSALS TODAY IN WASHINGTON FOR THE DISARRAY MISS OUT OF THE OTHER SO OF ICE WHEN I MET YOU KNOW I THINK IT IT'S JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT. IF THERE'S A NEED TO HAVE A ILLEGAL BACKSTOP THE CASE WASHINGTON DOES IT'S MORE CRAZY STUFF THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE ONE POINT IMMIGRANTS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW EMUS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS THE GENERAL POPULATION TOO SMART AND TO START AND RUN SMALL BUSINESSES. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. IMMIGRANTS AN OBVIOUS IS BOTH DOCUMENT AND UNDOCUMENTED YOU TALK WHEN IMMIGRANTS YOU THERE'S A HUGE CROSS OVER WITH SMALL BUSINESSMEN AND MANY. PARTS OF THE STATE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK THIS WALLACE'S COMMUNITY IT'S PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATS. AND SO. TO TO TO PROMOTE AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE STATE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS BOTH DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED. I WOULD AGAIN AND AND I. FUND AGREEING WITH JOHN OF THE FAMILY WHICH I THINK IT IS CERTAINLY HAD A DOABLE PROPOSAL WE HAVE AND MODELING HOW MUCH SHOULD WE ARE HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE REYES AND I DO THINK DEPENDING ON. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES IT ACT ACTION MIGHT HAVE SOME IMPACT ON HOW MUCH. FIXING THE FAMILY WHICH IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE THAT A DE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT WITH A DIFFERENT AYE ARRESTS WOULD HAVE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAY AND WOULD HAVE SOLVED IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT AGAINST GIVEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS IT WOULD IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO TAKE A LOOK. FOR FOLKS AGAIN YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WHO GET WORKER COVERAGE FOR THEMSELVES BUT NOT AFFORDABLE COVERAGE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND IT'S THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET SUBSIDIES IN THE EXCHANGES AT ADDED ARE AS A RESULT SOME OF THOSE FOLKS. BY COVERAGE ANYWAY THEY JUST PROVIDED A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE. OF OF THEIR INCOME AND. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD IT WOULD PROVIDE A GO A LONG WAY TOWARD AFFORDABILITY IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A HUGE POPULAR ELATION IT'S. BUT IT'S IT'S A POPULATION DESERVES SOME ATTENTION A DISH IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE OR FOR OTHER AFFORDABILITY PROPOSALS THAT WE OUTLINED ON THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO I DO IS TO DO ONE OF JUST HIGHLIGHT. WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE? IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL TERM BUT IT LITERALLY IS THAT HOW THE INSURERS DESCRIBED. HOW MUCH MONEY IS QUOTE UNQUOTE LOST TO ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE? THAT. THE. THAT IS THAT OF ITS TO DESCRIPTION OF HOW MUCH MONEY. IS GOING TO MEDICAL CARE THAT ARE. AND YOU KNOW WE WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE HIGHER AND AND JUST AS PUBLIC PROGRAMS DO IT WHETHER IT BE MEDICARE OR MEDIC HOW BOTH I. HAVE. MUCH HIGHER MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET NOW SOME OF THAT IS JUST THE. OUR. IMPACT OF HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO MARKETING AND HIGHER UP PEOPLE TO HELP SO THE PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW THE TRANSACTIONAL COSTS O. WITH RELATION TO THAT BUT SOME OF THAT IS ABOUT PROFIT AND SOME OF THAT IS ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDEN AND SO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN DO IT DO THAT ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU KNOW WE ARE. MORE ON THE. CALIFORNIA SIDE OF CHINESE YOU KNOW HOW THAT CENTRALIZING GET PEOPLE YOU KNOW INTO THESE PLANS AND THAT DID DOES THAT MEAN THAT HATE NOW WE CAN. ASK THE INSURERS TO. OF. OUR. BE MORE EFFICIENT I'M SINCE COVERED CALIFORNIA'S DOING SOME OF THAT WORK. A FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. BEFORE WE GET TO THE OTHER ONES I JUST SURE I UP. FULLY BY INCREASING THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO. PREMIUMS THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING MORE OF. SCENT OF THAT PREMIUMS WILL GO TOWARDS DIRECT HEALTHCARE RELATED COSTS THAT TRACK SO WE WILL SEE A BETTER BENEFIT. BY INCREASING THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO IN TERMS OF DIRECT RESULT IS CALIFORNIA VETERANS DAY YEAH AND I MEAN CURRENTLY THE WAY THE ACA WORKS IS THAT IF IT IF THEY SPEND TOO MUCH. OF. IT IF THEY VIOLATE THE MLR STANDARD THAN ACTUALLY. INDIVIDUALS GET REBATES AND YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AT THE X. ARCHITECTURE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS CALIFORNIANS HAVE GOTTEN DEBATE THEY TEND TO BE RELATIVELY SMALL. A CHECKS BECAUSE BUT IT IS A A A. IT'S IT'S A IT'S A USEFUL PRIDE TO ENCOURAGE THE INSURERS TO. THAT IF THEY IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO PROVIDE VALUE FOR THE CONSUMER THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE. THE THAT DAISY YOU KNOW TO PUT. THE PROOF FOR THE PUTTING PLAYER TO SAY IF THEY ARE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE WHATEVER THE RIGHT PERCENTAGES FOR. FOR PATIENT CARE. BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THEN THAT DOES STILL CIRCLE BACK TO. IF EIGHTY OR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE OF THE PREMIUM IS DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND DRUGS THAT WE STILL NEED A MECHANISM TO ADDRESS ADDRESSING THOSE BASE COSTS AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THINGS THAT I THINK SEVERAL OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. AND JUST TO FINISH SO I CAN PASS IT ON YOU KNOW I. I WAS MOVED PETER WHEN YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS A SHARED PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE TOGETHER. AND YOU HAD MENTIONED EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BUT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THERE AS. WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T FOLLOW WITH THE REST OF THE STATES WE ARE LEADING ON THIS ISSUE. AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING OUR FAIR SHARE. TO HELP OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE WORKING WHO ARE. STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY. AND IT'S JUST. REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT THIS PANEL HAS DONE. ON THE TO BRING THESE PRESENTATIONS HERE TODAY. PERFECT THANK YOU I THINK. I'M GONNA MORE COMMENTS I THINK THE QUITE SOME THE QUESTIONS THE KEY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I'M I'M DIGEST. BUT MORE COMMENTS AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU FOR. GIVING US YOUR STORIES AND AND THE IMPORTANCE THEIR. THE TAKE AWAY I GUESS FOR ME IS THAT. THAT AS WE. MOVE WERE MOVED WE NEED TO MOVE ON TWO TRACKS. WE NEED TO MOVE ON THE TRACK TO A SYSTEM THAT IS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE EXACTLY CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK ON THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN WORK ON NOW. AND AND BECAUSE IF WE DON'T CONTAIN COSTS IF WE DON'T SLOW DOWN AND BEND THE CURVE. IT'S GONNA MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. WITH A FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION. TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. AND SO THESE ARE FOUNDATIONAL THINGS THAT ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE DONE AND SO. I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT AS YOU AS WE FLESH THIS OUT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BE WORKING ON THIS YEAR. TO TO GET THERE BECAUSE THE OTHER THE OTHER PROJECTS WE KNOW. BASED ON OUR HEARING THAT WE HAD MONDAY. SOME OF THE SOME OF THE LOGISTICS AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE GOING FORWARD ARE MULTI YEAR CHALLENGES. AND. RIGHT WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT. WAIVERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH IF WITH A FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION. STILL TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS. WE DON'T HAVE A FRIENDLY ADMINISTRATION NOW BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T DO. THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE SLOW THIS DOWN. WHEN THE BEAUTIES OF MARYLAND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. SLOW THE COST DOWN. SORRY. WELL. YEAH. SLOW THE COST COULD SLOW THE COST CURVE DOWN IN A MINUTE AND IT AND THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS THAT. MARYLAND HAS HAS DONE WHAT MARROW HAS DONE IS IS IS IS REALLY ADMIRABLE. IT HAS BENT THAT CURVE. IS SLOW THE COSTS DOWN IT HASN'T DROPPED THEM BUT IT'S SLOWING THE COST DOWN AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT. SUSTAIN THE INCREASES YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SO I THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU FOR YOU DOING LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON A PARALLEL TRACK BUT RECOGNIZING THAT. WE CANNOT IGNORE THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO NOW. BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR US TO GET LIKE I SAID TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN. OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE GO TO. A PUBLIC PUBLIC COMMENT. I. YEAH I THINK ALL MY COMMENTS NOW. BEFORE THE PUBLIC COMES UP. IF THAT'S OKAY. SO I'M THIS IS I THINK THE LAST OF OUR HEARINGS LETS GET ONE THE LAST SCHEDULED HEARING WE MADE TWO MORE IT SOUNDS LIKE. WHICH IS FINE. AND I KNOW ARE THERE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW THINK THAT THIS HEARINGS WERE. YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARY BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM SOMEONE WHO NO MATTER WHAT IS GONNA HAVE TO VOTE ON SOMETHING. YEAH I AM I FOUND THEM VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY. EDUCATIONAL AND I HOPE THAT. EVERYBODY DID OUR HELP THE PUBLIC WATCHED AND LEARNED SOMETHING I KNOW THAT I LEARNED A LOT I THINK ALL OF US FROM GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS DID IN. YOU KNOW I I THINK ABOUT. I THINK A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION HAS TO DO WITH REALLY CHANGING IMPRESSIONS OF. WHAT WE THINK HEALTH CARE IS AND? THE SLOGANS AT A LOT OF THE ACTIVISTS USE ABOUT HEALTHCARE BEING A HUMAN RIGHT. MIHT KIND OF SOUND OBVIOUS BUT IT'S REALLY NOT OBVIOUS AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THE WAY THAT HEALTH CARE'S BEEN REGARDED IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONCE A TIME I'M SURE WHERE YOU KNOW. THE WAY THAT PEOPLE GOT HEALTHCARE WAS THEIR IN THEIR SMALL TOWN AND THERE WERE IT WAS A DOCTOR TO AND IF YOU GOT SICK YOU WENT TO THAT DOCTOR BUT WE'VE EVOLVED. YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONCE A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN IF YOUR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE THERE WERE DIFFERENT PRIVATE FIRE COMPANIES THAT YOU COULD CALL THAT WOULD KIND OF COME AND YOU COULD PAY THEM OR NOT PAY THEM TO AND IF YOU DIDN'T PAY HIM THEY WOULDN'T PUT. YOUR FIRE OUT. AT A CERTAIN POINT AS A SOCIETY WE DECIDED THAT. WE HAD A PUBLIC BENEFIT TOWARDS THEIR BEING PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE ALL PAID FOR. AND THE SAME THING WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION NOBODY QUESTIONS THAT ALL OF US PAY COLLECTIVELY INTO EDUCATING SOCIETIES CHILDREN WHETHER THE YOUR CHILD OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILD. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS. THE RESULT WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN THIS HEARING AND PEOPLE BEING HERE IS NOT JUST A RESULT OF COSTS GOING UP AND MEDICARE MEDICAID. MEDICAL CARE BEING LESS AND LESS EXPENSIVE BUT OF EVOLVING PERCEPTION ABOUT HEALTHCARE BEING SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL HAVE EQUALLY AND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD EXPECT. WE REALLY DO NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT PAYING FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE. WE DON'T EXPECT EVERYBODY TO PAY INDIVIDUALLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WE ALL PAY WE ALL QUE AND NOBODY QUESTIONS UP BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S A PUBLIC GOOD FOR ALL OF US OF HAVING EDUCATED CHILDREN. AND WE HAVE GOT TO THINK ABOUT HEALTHCARE IN THE SAME WAY FOR EVER GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF HEALTH CARE THAT WE WANT AND THE KIND OF ACCESS WE WANT. BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER FROM EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS BEEN UP HERE FROM ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL. SCALE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED THIS ISSUE THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAD THAT'S JUST BEEN THE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT TRULY A BALL FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS. IS ONE OF JUST ALMOST UNBRIDLED FREE MARKET COMPETITION. WITH IT WITH. PRIVATE COMPANIES PAYING THE BULK OF HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AT GREAT COST TO THEM. AND WITH A MARKET THAT'S. ALMOST UNREGULATED IS COMPARED TO OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS. AND SO. BUT THE SINGLE PAYER CONVERSATION IS YOU NO IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THE SINGLE BUT WHETHER WERE SINGLE PAYER OR NOT. THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION TOWARDS REALLY HAVING THE KIND OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WE NEED BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO. DO THAT THE COUPLE OF THINGS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE THAT WE'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO. NUMBER ONE TO TRULY REGULATE THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. FROM BEGINNING TO END SO THAT. COSTS ARE KEPT UNDER CONTROL BY GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY DOES IT. AND WE DO IT IN A LOT OF AREAS YOU KNOW IN IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND IN EDUCATION AND IN UTILITIES WATER AND POWER. WE DON'T HAVE THE UNBRIDLED FREE MARKET WORK. OUR GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHAT'S GOING TO BE PUTS FAIR TO PAY FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THOSE SERVICES WE ALL GET TO SEE WHAT THAT IS. EVERYBODY CAN LOOK AT THEIR WEBSITE FOR THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE WHAT THEY PAY FOR POLICE AND FIRE TO SEE HOW THEY NEGOTIATE THOSE TO SEE WHAT TEACHERS ARE PAID AND HOW WOULD ADMINISTRATORS ARE PAID. WE DON'T ALLOW THE FREE MARKET TO DECIDE WHAT ADMINISTRATORS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS OR IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PAID. BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THAT TO BE TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE UP TO THE FREE MARKET. AND. WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO DO THAT ON ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE WHICH IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM WHO WE DO NOW IN VERY DISRUPTIVE AND VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TO. LET'S BE HONEST LAST YEAR WE HAD A BILL JUST FOR TRANSPARENCY IN DRUG PRICING AND THAT BARELY GOT THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE SO THIS IS A HUGE TASK TO DO THIS ALL ACROSS. THE SPECTRUM OF HEALTH CARE BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY. REGULATE COSTS AND I FOUND IT REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE HAD SOME FOLKS FROM THE I A A VERY PROGRESSIVE DOCTORS GROUP COME UP AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO TESTIFY AND WHETHER THINGS THEY SAID WAS. WE NEED TO DO ALL THIS REGULATION BUT LET'S NOT LOOK AT DOCTOR SALARIES YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP THOSE SALARIES KIND WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE A DOCTOR SHORTAGE AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA. INTERRUPT THAT WELL WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW THAT ALL HAS TO BE ON THE TABLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE EVERYWHERE ELSE AND IF YOU HAVE ONE GROUP THAT CAN KIND OF CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT THEM THE NEXT GROUP'S GONNA WANT TO CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT IN THE NEXT GROUP. SO THIS IS I'M I'M SAYING THIS ONLY TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT HEALTH CARE THEN WE'VE DONE IT BUT I THINK. WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE WITH THE OTHER THING THAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM JUST DOESN'T WORK IT JUST DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T CONTAIN COSTS. IT DOESN'T DELIVER. CARE WELL AND I DO THINK THAT SINGLE PAYER IS THE GOAL BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO. UTILIZE THAT. ABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO. CONTROL COSTS AND NEGOTIATE ITS ELEGANT IT'S MORE SIMPLE. IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY IT'S ANOTHER PLACES BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE ONE THAT. IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT TO WE TALK YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE MENTION WASTE AND ALL OF THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS SOMEBODY'S PROFITS. SOMEONE'S JOB AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FIGHT BACK KNOWS A LOT OF THEM WITH IT GOT A LOT OF MONEY SO ALL OF US WHO WANT TO DO THIS HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING EASIER SIMPLE. THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE FIGHT AND EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AS YOU ALL KNOW. SORRY I DIDN'T REALLY I DID WRITE A SPEECH USER DOES NOTES ARM. AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM HERE. WE DO I THINK NEED A ROADMAP THAT BUILDS ON THE GOALS OF FIVE SIX TWO. YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES IT'S A GREAT STATEMENT OF VALUES BUT FLUSHING THIS OUT INTO A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. AND. YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY START DOING. REALIZING THAT WE DO NEED THAT ROADMAP WE NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE AT THE TIME WHEN WE HAVE A. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S POSITION TO GIVE US THE WAIVERS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT YOU THAT. THIS IS A ROADMAP THAT'S ACHIEVABLE IN STEPS IN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS WE GET THERE. IN COVERING ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS WHETHER THEY'RE DOCUMENTED OR NOT IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE COST CONTAINMENT TO GIVE RELIEF. TO FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE THERE'S ON AFFORDABILITY RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF THOSE AREAS SO I HOPE THAT EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US. I KNOW THE ADVOCATES ARE GOING TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW BLESSED SOME BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S THE ENERGY THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO TO HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW. US AND THE ONES THAT ARE THEM MAKING MONEY ON THIS AND WITHOUT I'M COMMITTED TO HAVING AS MANY HEARINGS AS IT TAKES TO WORK ON THIS. I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING AS LONG AS IT TAKES WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO. TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS A MODEL I'M FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I'M AYE I THINK EVERYBODY WHO DIDN'T SEE IT. IT'S EVERYBODY I DIDN'T WATCH THE OTHER HEARINGS PARTICULARLY THE LAST HEARING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE NEED TO WATCH THAT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO BE MINDFUL THERE MAY VERY WELL BE BALLOT MEASURES THAT ARE NECESSARY I YOU KNOW WE HEARD THE LEGAL EXPERTS SAY THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO. HAVE TO HAPPEN AND WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT WE DON'T TO BE TIED UP IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS EITHER. SO. YOU KNOW I I THIS IS THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS I THINK THAT ANY OF US CAN DO WHILE WE'RE UP HERE. I MEAN IF WE WALK OUT OF HERE WHENEVER HAVING FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND EXCELLENT FOR EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. EVEN IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN ALL RETIRE HAPPY LEGISLATORS SO. SAY THANKS AND WE'LL KEEP GOING. WHAT COULD ONE HAVE TO SAY AFTER THAT? NO I AT AGAIN AS ALWAYS IT'S YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN OF GREAT EDUCATION PROCESS AND THEY DO PROBABLY THINK WE WILL WILL CONTINUE IT I I THINK. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SENATE PERFECTLY IF WE DO NOTHING ELSE IF WE ARE. ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL CALIFORNIANS HEALTH CARE AND IN TURN CREATE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I THINK. WE HAVE ALL WELL DONE MORE MORE THAN WE EVER HAD HOPED FOR WHEN WE RAN FOR OFFICE SO. I AYE SO DITTO FOR EVERYTHING SHE SAID. WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO START PUBLIC COMMENT AND JUST AS WE STARTED THEM. HERE TODAY JUST WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE PANEL FOR BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE. AT. N'T. INTO START PUBLIC COMMENT AND JUST AS I SAID AT THE START. WE'RE GOING TO DO TWO MINUTES AT A TIME JUST TO ATTEMPT TO GET THROUGH. AYE IT WE'RE GONNA START HERE ON OUR LEFT AND THEN WILL. ALTERNATE HERE TO OUR RIGHT. GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A TERRIFIC HEARING. I'M ALISON VIEWS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF CTF CALIFORNIA AND THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP. CALIFORNIA STRONGER WHEN EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH COVERAGE IN CARE AND CALIFORNIA TOOK A HUGE STEP FORWARD. A FEW YEARS AGO BY PASSING HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS THAT EXTENDED MEDI CAL TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. HOWEVER RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT WHEN PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS ARE COVERED CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE COVERAGE AND GET TIMELY CARE AND ALSO PARENTS WHO ARE HEALTHY CAN CARE BET BETTER CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. SO EXTENDING COVERAGE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ONE IN SIX OF WHOM HAVE AT LEAST ONE PARENT WHO IS UNDOCUMENTED. CDF CALIFORNIA AND THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP STRONG SUPPORT THE HEALTH FOR ALL PROPOSAL PRESENT PRESENTED BY THE CFTC PANELIST AND AN ASSEMBLY BUDGET. BLUEPRINT. SPEAKING NOW ONLY FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT INCOME ELIGIBILITY LEVELS. AFFORDABILITY PROTECTIONS AND COMPREHENSIVENESS OF BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF ADULTS. IN MEDICAID AND CHIP IN PARTICULAR MEDICAID'S A COMPREHENSIVE PEDIATRIC AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE EPS DUTY BENEFIT IS THE GOLD STANDARD. UNPARALLELED IN ANY INSURANCE PRODUCT AND THIS IS WHAT ALL CHILDREN NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR FULL INTO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AND. TO BECOME A TAX PAYING CITIZENS WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT ANY PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD MUST THINK UP FRONT NOT AS AN AFTER THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSAL WILL IMPACT CHILDREN. PARTICULARLY THE MOST VULNERABLE. ANY ATTEMPT TO MAKE INCREMENTAL OR SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM MUST NOT RESULT IN CHILDREN LOSING GROUND FROM WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. OUT REFORM PROPOSALS MUST ENSURE THAT COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN IS AFFORDABLE EASY TO GET AND KEEP AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE LOTTERY OF GEOGRAPHY AND THAT CARE IS COMPREHENSIVE AND PEDIATRIC APPROPRIATE. FINALLY AS YOU WORK TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE ASKED YOU RECOGNIZE THE SPECIAL PROTECTIONS THAT CHILDREN NOW HAVE AND TO BUILD ON THAT PROP UP PROGRESS AND A MINIMUM TO DO NO HARM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TOM I'M MELINDA MARKETS REGISTERED NURSE AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. RECENTLY THE REPUGNANT AND PRESIDENT TRUCK RAMMED THROUGH A BILL THAT GIVES A HUGE CAT CASH TAX CUTS TO THE RICH. ELIMINATION OF THE MANDATE TO BUY INSURANCE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE COMPONENTS IN pSUGGEST WOULD PROP INSURANCE TO LEVY NEW DOUBLE DIGIT PREMIUM HIGH. IF WE DON'T IMPLEMENT SINGLE PAIR THE RESULT WILL BE MILLIONS WILL LOSE OR NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. AND EVEN MORE PREMIUMS RISING FORTUNATELY THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE IN CALIFORNIA A STATE BILL THAT WOULD GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ALL. FIVE SIX SENATE BILL FIVE SIX TWO IS NOT A SYMBOLIC BILL. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO IS A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM AS YOU HEARD TODAY FROM MICHAEL ID AND HAS HEALTH CARE FUNDING FINANCES. AS DOCTOR POLLAND SAID. AS A REGISTERED NURSE I HAVE WATCHED OUR PATIENTS AFTER. WE HAVE HEARD STORIES FROM OUR PATIENTS DELAYING CARE. CUTTING PILLS IN HALF OR TAKING MEDICATION EVERY OTHER DAY DUE TO THE COSTS. HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE TO GET MEDICAL CARE OR LOU ARE HAVE TO BUY FOOD HAVING TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. OR A BECAUSE OF MOUNTING A MEDICAL BILLS. WE ARE STILL ALL TOO FREQUENTLY THE DOES DIABETIC PATIENT IN FOUR LIMB AMPUTATION. A PREVENTABLE OUTCOME IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RENT AND FOOD OR INSULIN. THE FOOT LOSES. I SINGLE PAYER IS A PLAN THAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN FIGHTING HARD FOR. AT TO END STORIES LIKE THIS AND I WILL SAY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY TRANSPARENCY BILL. ANY PRINCIPLES WILL REALLY STOP THOSE STORIES. CALIFORNIA'S WORKING WILL IS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND CONCERNS. THAT MAY BE RAISED DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNICA HOLDS PUBLIC HEARINGS AS PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC. LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CONSIDER ANY AMENDMENTS AND VOTES ON THE BILL THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. SO MY INDIAN WORDS ARE. WE THE NURSES DEMANDED THAT SPEAKER RENDON RELEASE THE BILL OUT OF OF THE COMMITTEE AND DO HIS JOB AND E HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WILL HELP US WITH THAT. BECAUSE ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND WILL BE LOSING THEIR LIVES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MY NAME IS KATHY DONOGHUE I'D BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN MATERNAL CHILD UNIT WHICH I SHOULD NOT SEE DEATH. BUT I DO OFBOTH MATERNAL AND INFANTS A SADLY TO SAY. AS A REGISTERED NURSE MY LICENSE REQUIRES THAT I BE A PATIENT ADVOCATE SOMETHING I TAKE SERIOUSLY. EVERYONE HERE HAS EITHER BEEN A PATIENT FOR WILL BE A PATIENT SO MY ADVOCACY INCLUDES ALL OF YOU. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE WHO ELECTED YOU. IF EVERYONE IN EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS HAD THE CARE THEY NEEDED WHEN THEY NEEDED IT. WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. SADLY THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE UNNECESSARY DEATHS UNTIL S. B. FIVE SIX TWO IS LEGISLATIVE. I LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHITE HOUSE AND THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION THE NURSES OF THE STATE. AND THE PROUD SPONSOR VESTRY FIVE SIX TWO. NOT TO MENTION RECOGNIZE CATALYST OF THESE HEARINGS AND RESPONSIBLE FOR RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS ON THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. BEEN GIVEN SO LITTLE TIME TO DISCUSS GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. THERE BEEN SIX HEARINGS BY THE SLICK SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDING TODAY'S FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO HOURS NINETEEN TWENTY MINUTES FOR SOME OF. AS FOR SOME REASON YOU DECIDED TO GIVE THE NURSES ONLY THIRTY MINUTES OF THAT TOTAL TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WOULD GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. IN OTHER WORDS HIS COMMITTEE HAS A LOT OF ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF ITS TIME SHE HEARING FROM THE NURSES ABOUT THE ONLY MEANINGFUL SOLUTION TO OUR HEALTHCARE CRISIS. AND THAT IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WOULD GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. THAT MEANS THIS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS UPON WHAT BASIS TO THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINED TO A LOT ONLY ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME TO THE NURSES AND THEIR REPRESENTATION OF WHAT THEY THINK THE SOLUTION IS. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO THIS MUST STOP. GET INSURANCE OUT OF OUR HEALTH CARE SP FIVE SIX TWO IS NEEDED NOW NO MORE DELAYS NO MORE DOG AND PONY SHOWS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FIRSTLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR HOLDING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. AND ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS PARTICULARLY HEALTH ACCESS. HIKES CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AS WELL AS LABOR PARTICULARLY WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HOPE FOR ALL. AYE WE BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT WITH THROUGH HELL FOR ALL KIDS WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH. A LOT OF WE'VE MADE. VAST IMPROVEMENTS BUT I IN TERMS OF GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE RECOGNIZING THAT OVER HALF OF THE UNINSURED ARE UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT HEALTH FOR ALL. AS WELL AS WE TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE THE I LOVE TALKING ABOUT AN ANOTHER POPULATION THAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SENIORS INDIVIDUALS SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD IN MEDI CAL SO. I URGE OUR CONSIDERATION OF RAISING THAT THRESHOLD SO THAT THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE FOR ALL ADULTS I. OF SENIORS WHETHER YEAR ARE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT AYE IN ADDITION. LOOKING AT SOME OF THE GAINS THAT WERE MADE THROUGH WITH THE P. A CA AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED THROUGH MEDICAID HOW I. REALLY HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE BY LOOKING AT QUALITY AND I AND AND YEAR OVER YEAR IMPROVEMENTS IN SOUTH I'VE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THAT THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BE HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TERM AND. AND SO ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THOSE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. TOO QUICK NOTICED AGAIN I'M AFTER TWO MINUTES WE'RE GONNA TURN THE MIKE DOWN ONLY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TIME. THE SECOND ONE IS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY THE SERGEANTS THAT WE'RE AT CAPACITY CURRENTLY WITHIN THE ROOM AND SO THOSE WHO TESTIFY. IF YOU GO TO THE OVERFLOW ROOMS IT MAY ALLOW THE OTHERS TO ENTER THE ROOM TO TESTIFY AS WELL TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE AS MANY VOICES AS POSSIBLE. WITH THAT PLEASE. THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. MY NAME IS DOCTOR JONATHAN PIERCE I'M A SIXTY EIGHT YEAR OLD INTERNIST AND COMPLETED MY RESIDENCY AT UC DAVIS. AND RETIRED AT SIXTY SIX FROM PRIMARY CARE AND SEMI RURAL GRASS VALLEY NEVADA CITY. AREA I PLAN TO WORK UNTIL AT LEAST SIXTY NINE IT NOT SEVENTY. HAS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DISCUSSED BUT COULD NOT MAINTAIN PRACTICED MAINLY DUE TO IT ONEROUS ADMINISTRATIVE WORK PRESSURES HAVING TO DO WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AS. I HAD ONE POINT FIVE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. A PROVIDERS MYSELF IN A PART TIME NURSE PRACTITIONER. MY PATIENTS HAD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY MEDICARE INSURANCE SOME WITH MEDI CAL SECONDARY INSURANCE NOT TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT THIS YOU CAN GET AN ANECDOTE FROM A PRACTITIONER. THAT'S WHY. WITH A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEMS. AVOIDING A CALLING APPROVAL PROCESS I WOULD HAVE SAVED ABOUT ONE POINT SIX FULL TIME EMPLOYEES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR MY PRACTICE CONSERVATIVELY SAID. SO THANKS SO I'M IF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ARE IMPLEMENTED I ESTIMATE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THREE TO FOUR MORE PATIENTS A DAY. AND PROBABLY KEEP ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MORE PATIENTS MY TOTAL PATIENT PANEL. SO I TALK WITH THE PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONERS MY AREA AND IS AN ESTIMATE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT TOUSAND FORMER MEDI CAL PATIENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR WHO CANNOT NOW IF THIS. HEALTHY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED AS MY TIME IS RUNNING OUT OF A FEW OTHER POINTS BUT I'M GONNA STOP AND I JUST ASK THIS COMMITTEE. WITH ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'VE DONE PLEASE ASK SPEAKER RENDON TO RELEASE S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO FROM THE RULES COMMITTEE. FOR FLOOR DEBATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS DOCTOR NATASHA LEAD. I'M PRESIDENT OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS STRONG CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. I LIVE IN PRACTICE DENTISTRY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO SERVED AS A DENTAL SCHOOL ASSISTANT PROFESSOR. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND WITNESSES FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL TESTIMONY INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND DIFFICULT WORK OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ORAL HEALTH AND DENTAL COVERAGE CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM DISCUSSION. DENTISTS IN THEIR TEAMS ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF HOW POOR ORAL HEALTH CONTRIBUTES TO POOR OVERALL HEALTH. AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC DISEASE. THEM DISEASE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES RESPIRATORY DISEASE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES. POOR ORAL HEALTH CONTRIBUTES TO CHRONIC PAIN. LAW SCHOOL DAYS UNEMPLOYMENT. LOW SELF ESTEEM AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS INCLUDING OVER USE OF OUR HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS. THIS IS WHY CDA HAS JOINED WITH OTHER PROVIDER GROUPS TO OPPOSE S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. OUR GOAL IS TO PROTECT THE GAINS WE'VE MADE AN EXPANDING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR WORK TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE REGULAR ACCESS TO HEALTH OR DENTAL CARE. WE KNOW THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE COME BEFORE YOU IN RECENT YEARS TO URGE INVESTMENTS IMPROVEMENTS. ADDRESSING THE GAPS THAT EXIST ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS MORE PRUDENT THING TO DO RATHER THAN RECKLESSLY THROWING OUT OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND LOSING FOCUS ON THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING TO INSTEAD PURSUE AN UNDEFINED AND UNFUNDED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. AS YOU WEIGH THE PROPOSALS PRESENTED TODAY I URGE YOU TO PROTECT THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE UNDER THE ACA. ESPECIALLY A POSITIVE STEPS THE STATE HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE ACCESS TO DENTAL COVERAGE THROUGH MEDI CAL AND COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND LOOK FOR PRAGMATIC OPPORTUNITIES AND ALTERNATIVES TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING GAPS. CDI IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AS YOU SEARCH FOR REAL SOLUTIONS TO FORTIFY CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND TO ENSURE THAT ORAL HEALTH HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS GIULIANA MILLER NASA I AM REPRESENTING JOBS WITH JUSTICE A BROAD COALITION OF FORTY COMMUNITY AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS THE BAY AREA SAN FRANCISCO AND SO KNOW ABOUT. OUR COALITION INCLUDES DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT AND EMPOWER. WORKERS IN LOW WAGE SERVICE JOBS IMMIGRANT. COMMUNITY AND PETE AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALL SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE HEALTHCARE CRISIS. WE FULLY SUPPORT SP FIVE SIXTY TWO AS THE BEST SOLUTION TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. TWO HIGH QUOTE IT UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. ON A PERSONAL NOTE. I LOST MY FATHER WAS FIFTY THREE I LOST MY HUSBAND. BOTH WHO WERE DENIED CRITICAL TREATMENTS AT KAISER WHICH COULD HAVE SAVED THEM. A DOCTOR FOLLOWING MY HUSBAND'S DEATH CRYING SAID TO ME. HOW HE WAS STARTED IN THE HOW HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAPPENS? THE COST WAS A HUGE FACTOR IN MY LOS WE URGE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN SPEAKER ROAD DONE TO MOVE S. B. FIVE. SIXTY FIVE SIXTY TWO FORWARD AS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO GUARANTEE QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGELA PERRY WITH CONSUMERS UNION THE POLICY ARM OF CONSUMER REPORTS. AS AN ORGANIZATION STEEPED IN ADVOCACY FOR ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SAFE HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CONSUMERS. WE'RE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. BUT WE ARE NOT DONE. AS YOU HEARD FROM SEVERAL SPEAKERS TODAY COVERAGE GAPS STILL REMAIN AND COVERAGE UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ACCESS OR AFFORDABILITY FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA. WE HOPED THAT THE EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE STEEP RISE IN COSTING CARE. BUT. I AND TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF CARE ARE INTERWOVEN WITH EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN GAPS OF COVERAGE. WE THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THESE HEARINGS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOUGHTFUL AND PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS IN THE COMING YEAR. IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. UP MY NAME IS GUSTAVO IT AND I'M THE WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF YOUNG INVINCIBLES. YOUNG INVINCIBLES IS A NATIONAL RESEARCH POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED THEIR AMPLIFYING THE VOICES OF YOUNG ADULTS ACROSS THE ISSUES OF HEALTH CARE. A WORKFORCE HIGHER EDUCATION AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. OUR MISSION IS REALLY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. THE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT OUR WORK ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CONNECTED WITH MANY YOUNG ADULTS. LIVING. LIVING AND MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS FAMILIES WE HEAR STORIES FROM THOSE YOUNG ADULTS OF LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIAN PARENTS. THAT ARE LOCKED OUT OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND ARE SUFFERING AND DYING FROM TREATABLE CONDITIONS AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE WHEN YOUNG AMERICANS HAVE TO CARE FOR ILL PARENTS. WHO ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS A PORTABLE HEALTH CARE IT CREATES A DOMINO EFFECT? YOUNG ADULTS IN THIS POSITION ARE FORCED TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT CONTINUING EDUCATION CAREER CHOICES AND EVEN STARTING FAMILIES. WE KNOW THAT THE SOCIAL AND FISCAL COST OF EXCLUDING THE SET A SEGMENT OF THE STATE'S POPULATION SETS BACK CALIFORNIA. AS A WHOLE AND WE BELIEVE. THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN PROMOTING THE WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ARE PROUD TO BE HERE. WITH YOU AS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION ALSO AS A CAP BUT ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER IN SUPPORT OF. ADDRESSING THE OVERALL COST AND QUALITY OF CARE. IN MOVING US TOWARDS A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT EXPANDS COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. BUT YOU START TOM SOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT IN. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HEARINGS AND IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. AYE I THINK FOR A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. SO ALIVE PEOPLE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THIS HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE UPPER PROPOSALS THIS YEAR I THINK ANY OF THE REPORT TO SHOOT HERE. BOARD BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM IT WILL REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN FUNDING IN THIS YEAR AND SO IF WE GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THAT MIGHT BE I THINK THAT WILL. HELP INFORM THE DECISIONS THIS COMMITTEE MAKES A GOVERNMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS GOING TO FOCUS ON PROPOSALS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL GOING FORWARD IS GIVEN THE CLIMATE IN DC. WE THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROGRESS EMERGING GUIDED BY FOR A KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES WHEN WE LOOK AT LEGISLATION THE FIRST UNIVERSAL ACCESS MAKING SURE EVERY CALIFORNIAN. A REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS HAS ACCESS TO CARE AND COVERAGE THE SECOND IS AFFORDABILITY ESPECIALLY WITH BUT LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE HOW. YOU YOU CAN DO THIS IN THE FORM OF MORE GENERAL SUBSIDIES BUT BUT THAT UP POPULATION REALLY IS THOUGH AT THE ONE KIND OF. GET IN CROSSED A LITTLE BIT A IN THAT MARKET. THIRD POSITION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I KNOW WE'VE WORKED DOCTOR ARAMBULA ON SOME GME FUNDING THAT WE LOOK TO CONTINUE THAT ADVOCACY THIS YEAR FINALLY A MARKET STABILIZATION THIS CAN COME IN THE FORM OF. A REINSURANCE PROGRAMS IN THERE SOME OTHER POLICY PROPOSALS BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE UP PREMIUMS DO NOT. GO UP DOUBLE DIGIT EVERY YEAR BY GIVING SOME CERTAINTY TO THAT MARKET TO US ENSURE A LOW PRICES SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR ALL THESE HEARINGS. HELLO MY NAME IS DIANE MCCLURE I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS AND I WORK HERE IN A RECOVERY ROOM IN SACRAMENTO AREA. THE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL IS REAL PROBLEM HERE. ALL THE COUNTER ATTACKING ENGAGED IN BY THE CO CHAIRS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE SPEAKER HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIVE S. B. FIVE SIX TWO SUPPOSEDLY LACKING IN DETAILS. BUT WITHOUT ADEQUATE DISCUSSION WITH THE NURSES MAIN SPONSORS OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. STOP ATTACKING THE NURSES. STOP TRYING TO NEGOTIATE THE BILL IN THE PRESS AND STOP THE FACADE. WE NEED TO MOVE PAST THESE HEARINGS AND START SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT THE NURSES SOLUTION SINGLE PAYER GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. AND STOP BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO GO TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BY CALLING FOR MORE INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE AND THEREBY TAKE THE SIDE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PLEASE. OUR PATIENTS DEMANDED THE NURSES DEMANDED. THE ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO DEVELOP THE COURAGE TO RECOGNIZE THAT S. B.FIVE SIX TWO IS NOT WOEFULLY INCOMPLETE. AS YOU HEARD TODAY. THIS IS A DEBATE IS A DIVISION OF. THIS IS A. DIVERSIONARY TACTIC DESIGNED TO KEEP THE FOCUS OFF THE FACT THAT THERE'S A SEVERE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL IN THE ASSEMBLY. TO HELP PATIENTS BUT AN ABUNDANCE OF POLITICAL WILL TO HELP THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE COULD CARE FOR ALL WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. THANK YOU MA'AM. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS FLOYD BRIAN I'M FROM LA ON INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COUNCIL. AND WE ARE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF FIVE SIX TWO WE WANT. AND WE ALSO ARE WE'VE ALWAYS WORKED FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE IN OUR. LONG SHORT. UNION AND. HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM VERY FEW OF YOU HAVE BETTER HEALTHCARE THAN I DO. BUT MY BIGGEST QUESTION TO YOU UP THERE IS WHY NOT. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM SHOULD HAVE HEALTHCARE ON A PARITY WITH WHAT I HAVE. WE HAVE OTHER LOCALS THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO PAY. ONE IS THEY MAKE THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THEN THEY PAY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A COLD PAID THREE HUNDRED A MONTH SO THEY'RE DOWN ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TO LIVE ON. THEM IN THEIR FAMILY WHY CAN'T WE DO BETTER. WHY CAN'T WE TAKE THE MONEY THAT? MY LOCAL IS SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS. THEN PUT IT BACK INTO WAGES AND PENSION AND BACK INTO THE ECONOMY. AND YOU SIT UP THERE AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE HOW WOULD DO THE MONEY THIS IS THE SIXTH OR EIGHTH I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND YOU GUYS CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT. I MEAN SERIOUSLY I BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AND MY LAST QUESTION IS HOW MUCH LONGER WE GONNA KICK THIS CAN'T ON THE ROLE. SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU SO. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTORS WOULD AND ARAMBULA AND THE STING MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY MY NAME IS SANDY READING. I'M ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND AN OPERATING ROOM NURSE OF THIRTY YEARS. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT INCREMENTALISM. AND. AND ALSO. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BY WAY OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER. INSURANCE IS NOT HEALTH CARE. WE KNOW THAT AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY AND I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY. I WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE NURSE. THAT NURSE WORK VERY HARD. GOT A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. AND EXCEEDED THE TREATMENT. TIME SO THE HOSPITAL FIRED HER. THERE IS A BREAK IN TREATMENT AND THAT NURSE PASSED AWAY. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME THAT'S PERSONAL TO ME. AND I WILL FIGHT FOR S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. AND HEALTHCARE FOR ALL UNTIL I TAKE MY LAST BREATH. I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY. I WAS WILLING A CHILD INTO THE OPERATING ROOM WHEN THE BILLING PERSON CAME WITH A PIECE OF PAPER SAID WAIT WAIT. GREW AND I SAID WAIT ABOUT WHAT. FIRST OF ALL DON'T GET BETWEEN A NURSE AND A PATIENT JUST TELL YOU THAT. THAT CHILD DID HAVE SURGERY. AND I HAD TO GO UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WE DON'T DO SURGERY ON PEOPLE THAT DON'T. REQUIRE MEDICALLY OKAY SO INCREMENTALISM IS NOT THE ANSWER INSURANCE IS NOT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIX TWO AND OUR PATIENTS CANNOT WAIT. MY NAME IS JENNIFER HOME I'VE BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR TWELVE YEARS AND I WORK IN A NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT CYBERCOOK TINY BABIES. SPEAKER RENDON HAS CLAIMED PUBLICLY THAT IS SPOKEN AT LENGTH TO THE SPONSORS ABOUT MAKING THE NECESSARY AMENDMENTS TO S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. THE TRUTH IS AFTER FREEZE IN THE BILL ON THE RULES COMMITTEE ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE SPEAKER HAS NEVER SPOKEN TO SEE ANY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATES OR POLICY STAFF OR ANY NURSE LEADERS OF CNN AT ANYTIME ABOUT THE BILL. DESPITE MULTIPLE REQUESTS FROM US THE LEAD SPONSORS OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. CNN SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED DURING THE ASSEMBLY LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE AN ASSEMBLY THAT IS RELEASED TO DO ITS JOB. FREE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS AND VOTE ON A BILL THAT IS CRITICAL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. INSTEAD THE SPEAKER HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND ATTACK THE VERY PEOPLE TRYING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE OF THE STATE. WHEN HE SAYS. THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT SINGLE PAYER. COULD THAT NOT HAVE HAPPENED DURING THE PROCESSING OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO THROUGH THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH ALSO INCLUDES HEARING SUCH. WHY HASN'T THE SPEAKER LET THE BILL PROCEED THROUGH THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN WHICH POLITICIANS WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MATTER? PLEASE RELEASE THE BILL GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF OUR HEALTH CARE WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL NOT GUARANTEED INSURANCE. WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIX TWO NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JANE SANDOVAL AND I'M A REGISTERED NURSE I'VE BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS I RECKON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO I SEE ON A DAILY BASIS PATIENTS COMING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR CARE DUE TO LACK OF OR POOR OR COMPLICATED ACCESS TO CARE. FOR BUSINESSES BUYING POLICIES APART FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH IS WHERE MOST AMERICANS GET THEIR COVERAGE THE NEXT YEAR'S PREMIUM INCREASES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE BY UNPRECEDENTED PERCENTAGES. AT LARGE. COMPANIES. PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYER PLANS ROSE THREE PERCENT THIS YEAR TO AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR. DOLLARS THAT COSTS IS USUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS THE COSTS KEEP GOING UP. PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO USE THEIR INSURANCE MANY EFFECTIVELY HAVE NO HEALTH CARE THIS MUST CHANGE. GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF OUR HEALTH CARE HEALTH CARE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL NOT GUARANTEED INSURANCE WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIX TWO LET US ELIMINATE HEALTH CARE IN THE QUALITY AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. NOW. HI. MY NAME IS WORTH A COOL I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND I'M AN OFFICER WITH CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT TWO CHILDREN WITH CANCER. THAT I SEE ON MY JOB THEIR IDEAL CHILDREN.

WE'RE NO INSURANCE OR IS UNDER INSURED CHILD EIGHT GETS AN EARLY DIAGNOSIS. AND PROMPT TREATMENT CHILD BE HAS DELAYED DIAGNOSIS AND DELAY TREATMENTS AND MISSED APPOINTMENTS. CHILD A AND CHILD BE BOTH BECAUSE OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS NEEDS SPECIALTY CARE TO SURVIVE. SHALL THEY GET SICK. CHILD BE DOES NOT CHILD DAY SURVIVES. CHILD BE DOES NOT THIS IS THE GRIM REALITY OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THE KITTY MAKE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A TAX PAYER PAID GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE. YET SOMEONE STILL DO NOT WANT TO GUARANTEE TAXPAYER PAID HEALTH CARE IS A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHT TO THE REST OF US. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS IS DUE TO A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL. IN THIS IS NOT TRUE. FROM WHAT YOU SAY IN THIS IS NOT TRUE PLEASE STAND WITH NURSES TO PROTECT AN ADVOCATE FOR OUR PATIENTS. WE CALL ON YOU TO GET RENDON TO RELEASE THE BILL IT IS THE ONLY CONCRETE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU RELEASE S. B. FIVE SIX TO MOVE IT THROUGH THE REGULAR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE ALL KNOW THAT HEALTH CARE JUSTICE CANNOT WAIT. HELLO MY NAME IS CAROL COOLEY HAD BEEN A NURSE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS ON. CARDIAC UNIT. HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT ALL OF YOU SEEM TO AGREE. BUT ARE SOMETHING IMPACT AS A HUMAN RIGHT IT CANNOT BE DENIED JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE CAN'T AFFORD IT. BUT THAT'S THE SYSTEM YOU THE ASSEMBLY ARE PROMOTING IN BACKING ONE IN WHICH HEALTHCARE IS IN FACT DENIED WHEN SOMEONE CAN'T AFFORD IT. SO YOU SO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU CAN'T CLAIM IT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENDORSING A SYSTEM THAT DENIES HEALTH CARE. WHEN SOMEONE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY. THE TWO ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. STOP MISLEADING THE PUBLIC AND CHOOSE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. LIKE THE BIBLE SAYS NO ONE CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS EITHER YOU HATE ONE. AND LOVE THE OTHER OR YOU BE DEVOTED TO ONE AND DESPISE THE OTHER. YOU CAN NOT SERVE BOTH GOD AND MONEY. THE SAME IS TRUE IN THIS INCIDENT YOU CANNOT SERVE THE PEOPLE WHILE SERVING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES YOU CAN YOU HATE. THE ONE AND LOVE THE OTHER. IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM AND THE WHITE CLEARLY BEING PROMOTED THROUGHOUT THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR PROFITS ARE LOVED BY OUR POLITICIANS FIRST. WELL THE PEOPLE THE PATIENTS GET LIP SERVICE ABOUT HEALTH. HEALTH CARE BEING A HUMAN RIGHT. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH CARE IS TRULY HUMAN RIGHT AND THAT THIS IS BEING SUPPORTED IS THE ONLY BILL THAT CALLS FOR THE TRUE SINGLE PAYER. GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL WE NEED HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO NOW. HUMAN MARK VAN LANDLORDS ARE REVOLUTION CONTRA COSTA. DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS A HEAVY LIFT. IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AND WILL REQUIRE OUR MORAL STRENGTH. WHEN I WAS DRIVING OVER ON ONE OF THE OVERPASSES WAS TO SIGN WHAT WOULD MLK DO. WE JUST RECENTLY CELEBRATED THE MEMORY OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING AS APPROPRIATE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW. BECAUSE THE FIGHT FOR HEALTHCARE EQUALITY IS THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL EQUALITY IT IS THE FIGHT FOR ECONOMIC EQUALITY IT IS THE FIGHT. FOR RACIAL EQUALITY AND YEARS FROM NOW IT WILL BE ASKED OF US WHAT WERE WE DOING WHEN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WERE SUFFERING WITHOUT HEALTHCARE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THIS DEBATE TO PRIORITIZE THE VOICES OF THE NURSES THERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS BROKEN SYSTEM. THEY KNOW THE FACES BEHIND THE NUMBERS THEY KNOW THE STORIES BEHIND THE STATISTICS. AND TO UNDERLINE THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT IT CAN'T BE DONE ENOUGH. EVERYDAY WE LET THIS CRISIS CONTINUE. IT'S ANOTHER NEIGHBOR GONE. IT'S ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER GONE. IT'S ANOTHER CHILD GONE. SO THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO HONOR THE LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. THEN TWO FORWARD TO ADVOCATE TO FIGHT. PASS S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. PLEASE BE LEADERS IN THAT FIGHT THANK YOU. SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS THE LORD STERN HELIO. I BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I WORK IN A NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. ONE HERE'S TO CRITICISM. THAT S. B. BY SIXTY TWO CANNOT PROCEED. BECAUSE ALL OF THE DETAILS HAVE NOT BEEN SPELLED OUT AHEAD OF TIME. THIS IS WRONG. BUT FOR THE ABSENCE OF POLITICAL WELL AND LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE DETAILS IN ANY ALLEGED DEFICIENCIES. WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT BY NOW. SINGLE PAYER GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME. IT REQUIRES OUR BASS THINKING. NOW IS NOT THE TIME. TO STOP BEFORE WE START. IDEAS MATTER AND THIS IDEA IS SUPPORTED. BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS AND AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. IDEAS MATTER. AND THE EMBRACE OF IMPORTANT IDEAS BY THOSE IN POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP. IS HOW GREAT THINGS HOW GREAT THINGS ARE ACCOMPLISHED. GONE ARE THE DAYS OF POLITICIANS WHO CLAIM TO SUPPORT GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. OR THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. BUT WHO SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACK THE ONLY BILL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WOULD GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. AND IN FACT MAKE IT A HUMAN RIGHT. GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF OUR HEALTHCARE. WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. NOT GUARANTEED INSURANCE RELEASE THE BILL. WE NEED S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO NOW. THANK YOU MA'AM MY NAME IS CASEY CARPENTER I'M A PARENT ANA ELECTED THAT DELEGATE THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY I'M A LEADER IN OUR EVOLUTION. AS A LEAD THE CALIFORNIA.

AND PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO TO DO THAT AND WE BELIEVE WE CAN BE DOING THIS TO TARGET THE DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE ACROSS REGION. OF ACROSS RACE ETHNICITY. GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION ALL THESE FACTORS THAT WE KNOW THAT IMPACT PEOPLE'S HEALTH OUTCOMES ON AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR TO. MOVE THIS. STEP THIS YEAR AND. LOOK FOR THAT CONVERSATION THINK. COULD YOU. MY NAME IS NORMA WILCOX.

A MEMBER AND A DIRECTOR OF THE ORGANIZATION HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WHICH IS A STATEWIDE. ORGANIZATION AND I'M ALSO A AND ELECTED DELEGATE TO THE DEBATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. AND THE OF VARYING SYSTEMS ONE THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS IT'S ALL NON PROFIT. IT'S NONPROFIT. AND ONE OF THOSE WAYS THAT THEY GET THAT IS THROUGH THEIR LEGISLATORS. IT'S THE LEGISLATORS RESPONSIBILITY. TO CREATE A SYSTEM. SO THAT EVERY PERSON HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE. HEALTHCARE. AND I'M GOING TO JUST SHARE A PERSONAL STORY OF HOW. YOU AS LEGISLATORS ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE BUT POVERTY LEVEL. AND IN THIS IN THIS WAY. IS. I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT. AND SOON AFTER MY HUSBAND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER SO WE WERE BOTH UNABLE TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME. IT TOOK US TEN YEARS TO PAY OUR MEDICAL BILLS. WE ENDED UP ALMOST IN BANKRUPTCY AND HOMELESSNESS.

I DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE AMONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AND EXCLUDING THEM FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS COMPOUNDS THAT VULNERABILITY HARMING THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY AND EVERYONE WHO DEPENDS ON THEIR LABOR AND ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS. AND AS WAS NOTED EARLIER DENYING ACCESS TO A SEGMENT OF THE COMMUNITY ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE INSTABILITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH AFFECTS US ALL. COVERING UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS IS A CONCRETE PRACTICAL AND HUMANE STEP TOWARDS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AND I ENCOURAGED LEGISLATURE TO MOVE MINISTER STINKY SINGER I AM A DELEGATE TO CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AYE IN ADDITION I AM DISABLED ARE AYE. WELL IT IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST HEALTHCARE PLANS OUT THERE. AND. WE HAVE DRAINED OUR SAVINGS ON MY DISABILITY.

AND THE WINNER WAS TOMMY DOUGLAS. THANK YOU. NANCY FORMING A FROM NEVADA CITY CALIFORNIA. THIS IS MY STORY. BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX I WAS A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE. AND I WAS STRUCK WITH A VERY SERIOUS. AUTOIMMUNE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AND I IMMEDIATELY BECAME. UNINSURABLE. AND A YEAR LATER. WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE. I FIND MYSELF DECIDING WHERE TO PURSUE MY CAREER NOT BASED ON WHAT'S THE BEST FIRM FOR ME TO BE AT. OR HEAVEN FOR BED TO EVEN BE ABLE TO START MY OWN BUSINESS I HAD NO CHOICE. MY CRITERIA WAS FINDING A FIRM THAT HAD. GROUP COVERAGE UNDER WHICH I COULD BE COVERED MY ONLY OPTION. SO FOR FORTY YEARS IN THAT SITUATION. I YES HAD COVERAGE BUT I FOUGHT WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A REGULAR BASIS DENIED COVERAGE I'VE SPENT. HOURS MONTHS YEARS ON IN TELEPHONE CALLS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND WHAT I FIND THE MOST DISGUSTING ABOUT THAT WHOLE SITUATION IS THAT. IT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF MY CARE IT WAS ABOUT. SOME SHAREHOLDER MAKING A PROFIT OR SOME C. E. O. THAT NEEDED A NEW YACHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS. FORTUNATELY AND THE LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN FINALLY ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION TO NOT WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE I CAN GET COVERED UNDER THE A. C. I. BUT ALL TOO YOU WHAT IT IS NOT PERFECT IT IS FAR FROM PERFECT I HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE IT IS OBSCENELY EXPENSIVE MY PREMIUM LAST YEAR WENT UP TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT AS OF JANUARY FIRST. AND AND I'M STILL FIGHTING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES. SO. I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WE GET. INSURANCE PROFIT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS IS GOING TO WORK. BRING S. B.

FIVE SIXTY TWO WAS FROZEN HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM THE. PEOPLE ON THE FRONTLINE NURSES TEACHERS PEOPLE IN EDUCATION WHO SEE CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL HUNGRY THE ONLY MEAL THAT THEY HAVE IN SCHOOL OFTEN IS THEIR LUNCH. AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU I'M ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN DO THIS. THIS BILL WAS FROZEN BECAUSE IT WAS THROWN UNDER THE BUS BECAUSE IT WAS POLITICAL BECAUSE WE ARE OWNED BICU OUR OWN NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE BUT OUR OWN BY TRI NATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND CORPORATIONS WERE DRIVING OUR STATE. DOWN THE MUD DOWN THE TUBES. I WROTE IT HAD A RESOLUTION PASSED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR OIL EXTRACTION SERB REALLY CAN GET IT DONE IN THE LAST. WEEK INSURANCE NOBODY DOWN HERE CALIFORNIA SEE MY TEE SHIRT IT'S CALLED THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN THE REVIVALS HERE IN YOUR MORAL GOODNESS RIGHT NOW IS IS V. BEING VIEWED Y. CALIFORNIANS. ANIME WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF ACTION ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING POORER AND POORER AND BAR. AND WITHOUT HEALTH CARE. WHAT'S OUR SOCIETY INCOME GET COMMUNITIES AT RISK. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE STAVING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHENEVER THERE'S. A FAMILY MEMBER THAT CANNOT GET OUT CARE IF THAT'S THE WHOLE FAMILY. FOR GOOD THIS IS YOUR MORAL WELL MY NAME IS ROBIN WALLACE I THAT THE NEVADA CITY. I AM A RETIRED NURSE IN VERY PROUD OF THE CN A AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE. ALL THAT THEY'VE DONE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. I'M ALSO A NATURALIZED CITIZEN FROM CANADA. I'VE LIVED HERE FOR A LONG TIME AND I GO BACK AND FORTH TO CANADA BECAUSE I HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY THERE. NOW I CAME THREE WEEKS AGO WITH NANCY FLEMING YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN HER BEFORE SHE IS SLOWING HONOR ARM. AND WE WERE HERE AND ON HER WAY HOME. SHE FELL IN HER DRIVEWAY AND BROKE HER. ELBOW LEFT ELBOW. OF SINCE THENTWO WEEKS LATER SHE HAD SURGERY A PLATE TO SCREW PRAYER PUT IN. AND A PROBABLY ANOTHER WEEK OR SO SHE'LL GET IT REMOVED AND SHALL BE GOOD. NOW COINCIDENTALLY I WAS BACK IN CANADA IN TRONG TOLL. LAST SEPTEMBER. OF WITH MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND SHE FELL AND BROKE HER ELBOW. AND I SPENT HOURS WITH HER IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM PADDED CAST APPLAUDED THEN A REFERRAL TO. GO TO AN ORTHOPEDIC CLINIC WHICH WE DID MANY HOURS LATER. SHE HAD AN APPOINTMENT FOR SURGERY. SHE HAD THAT TWO WEEKS LATER. AND TO A WITH A PLATE AND TWO SCREWS. AND THEN SHE. HAD THAT REMOVED AND SHE'S FINE. WHAT? SHOULDN'T WAIT. HOW MANY MONTHS EIGHT? MONTHS FOR AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY NO SHE HAD IN EXACTLY THE SAME TIME. AS MY FRIEND NANCY. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY ONE GOING THROUGH. A IN TORONTO ON A BIG BIG HOSPITAL SAINT MIKE'S AND. VERY VERY CROWDED VERY VERY BUSY. THERE WAS NO MENTION THERE IS NOT EVEN A WHISPER OF COST. THERE IS NO MENTION OF DEDUCTIBLES. I HOPE PAY. PREMIUM THIS IS WHAT CANADIANS ARE. THEY EXPECT. AND. THAT'S WHAT THEY GET. I DO NOT. GOOD AFTERNOON I THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I'M ERIC LEAN SOON CO DIRECTOR OF THE BUSINESS ALLIANCE FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. WE ARE BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. AND THAT SHOULD BE A LITTLE SURPRISED. THERE HAS BEEN MORE BUSINESS REPRESENTATION TO TESTIFY WHAT THE ISSUES ARE FACING BUSINESS YOU HAVEN'T HAD A PARTICULARLY SYMPATHETIC BUSINESS CROWD. IN THE AUDIENCE I'VE NOTICED BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS BUSINESSES WE SHARE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS A GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS THAT HEALTH INSURANCE. COSTS PART EATING AWAY AT OUR ABILITY TO SURVIVE TO PROVIDE FOR EMPLOYEES PEOPLE IN BUSINESS ARE GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER ABOUT WHERE THINGS HAD GONE BECAUSE THE PRICES DON'T SEEM TO STOP GOING UPS YOU HAVE THE HIGH COST. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE OF LACK OF RECOGNITION OF WHAT OUR NEW ECONOMY. IS DOING. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED INTO THE SO CALLED GIG ECONOMY WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT HOW ARE THESE FOLKS. WHETHER THEY'RE ENTREPRENEURS ARE NOT. GOING TO SURVIVE IN AN ECONOMY WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE READY ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK. AT THIS ISSUE WHO WON UNLEASH ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS IN THE STATE I THINK ONE OF THE INNOVATIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS UNTIE. THE QUESTION OF HEALTH INSURANCE HEALTH ACCESS FROM EMPLOYMENT. I DON'T SEE WHERE AT THIS POINT A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT REALLY IS VERY USEFUL. AS A SYSTEM IT HAS NOT WORKED FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK IF WE WANT TO GROW THIS ECONOMY. WE BE WELL SERVED UNDERSTAND BUSINESS CAN PAY ITS RIGHTFUL SHARE OF HEALTH COSTS BUT LET'S NOT CONTINUE SADDLING BUSINESS WITH THE NEED TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JACOB MILLER I'M WITH THE SEIU LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY ONE. I'M AN ANIMAL CARE TECHNICIAN FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT THEM SERVICES FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS. WHEN I GOT MY JOB AS A CIVIL SERVANT I ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY I WENT TO WAS BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HEALTH BENEFITS THAT CAME ALONG WITH IT. HOWEVER I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THESE ALL COME AT A COST AND AS THE RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS GO UP. WE HAVE DIFFICULTY BARGAINING FOR HIGHER WAGE TO BE ABLE TO COVER THESE COSTS AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITH MY LIFE. I'M THE FATHER OF A SPECIAL NEEDS ARE SUNG HE'S ARTISTICA SPECTRUM DISORDER. AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD HAVE IN HOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE COMING TO THE HOUSE. AND THANKS TO HOPE FOR MY PARENTS AND THROUGH THE ARE REGIONAL CENTERS WE'RE ABLE TO COVER THE COPAYS HOWEVER MY INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE CHARGED ME. A COPAYS FOR EVERY SINGLE VISIT WHICH WOULD NUMBER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ON AFFORDABLE MY SON WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE IN THE POSITION THAT HE IS RIGHT NOW. A WHICH IS UNRECOGNIZABLE FROM. BACK THEN. HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME MY MOTHER IN LAW'S A. CHILDCARE WORKER ON. SHE HAS A DIFFICULT TIME THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME OF YEAR OF GETTING THERE A HEALTH CARE DONE. AND. AT ANY RATE. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO OUR CARE FOR OURSELVES AND. IT'S HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET ON A WHEN I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. COUPLE WEEKS AGO I TO THE FLU. I HAD AN EMERGENCY ROOM I VISIT COSTS THE UP PAY FOR THAT. A BASICALLY MEANT THAT OF YOU KNOW I HAD TO SKIP A NUMBER OF LUNCHES AND BREAKFASTS JUST SO I COULD NOT MAKE SURE I KEPT FOOD ON THE TABLE. ANYWAYS ARM. I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN KNOCK DO WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO OUR STOP THE RUNAWAY COSTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. I'M HENRY ABRAMSON A PHYSICIAN. A FORMER BOARD CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER PHYSICIANS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM. AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. TO FOCUS SOLELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SINGLE PAYER. WE DO RESEARCH WE DO ADVOCACY AND WE DO EDUCATION. IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING TO HAVE HEARD SINGLE PAYER MENTIONED SO MANY TIMES DURING THESE HEARINGS. BY THE AUDIENCE BY THE WITNESSES AND BY THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE TO SAY AS A STUDENT. OF SINGLE PAYER FOR MANY DECADES. THAT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF REALLY WHAT SINGLE PAYER IS. I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE GETS A GRADE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SHE PLUS AND THE MINUS. BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED YOU'RE ALL SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT YOU NEED TO KEEP STUDYING IT. WE ASKED TO TESTIFY AND WE WERE ARE POLITELY REJECTED BUT I THINK THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE A RESOURCE TO THE COMMITTEE SO THAT YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND SINGLE PAYER POLICY FOR EXAMPLE. THE TALK ABOUT COST CONTROL SINGLE PAYER IS COST CONTROL. IT'S SETTING PRICES. AND IT'S SETTING A BUDGET. AND THEN IT'S RUNNING A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC AS CUSTODIANS OF THEIR MONEY. AND STAYING WITHIN BUDGET. IT'S VERY EASY TO DO CONCEPTUALLY I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EASY TO DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT. OF THE LAST COMMENT IS ABOUT THE TWO TRACKS THAT THE COMMITTEE INVASIONS AT LEAST SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ENVISIONED WORKING ON. ONE OF THOSE TRACKS CONTINUES TO BE INCREMENTAL REFORM AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO INCREMENTAL REFORM. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP OUR ATTENTION ON THE OTHER TRACK BECAUSE THE OTHER TRACK LEASE TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT ANTHONY WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT. THE INCREMENTAL REFORM TRACK LEADS FROM ONE OBSTACLE TO THE NEXT OBSTACLE TO THE NAFT NEXT OBSTACLE. IT WAS CHARACTERIZED DECADES AGO AS BILLIONS FOR BANDAIDS AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S VERY HONORABLE. TO TAKE OUT A BANDAID AND PUT IT ON A LOOM. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE NEED A TRANSFORMATION OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SINGLE PAYER. MY NAME IS RYAN SKOLNICK I'M ALSO ELECTED DELEGATE TO THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THERE ARE A FEW TRUTHS THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD RIGHT NOW. FIRST THE PREMISE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO BE FRANK IS A SHAM. WE HAD AN AWESOME CONVERSATION WITH ROBERT POLLIN WHO WROTE THE STUDY WHICH UNTIL RECENTLY A LOT OF YOU REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN EXISTED. WHY ON EARTH WAS THAT CONVERSATION NOT HELD WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHERE FINDING COULD ACTUALLY BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL AND WE COULD HAVE SOLVED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS? THAT RED DAWN USES AS A JUSTIFICATION TO SHELVE THE BILL. MICHAEL LADY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THE POLICY ISSUES WITH THE BILL ADDRESS A LOT YOUR QUESTIONS WHY ON EARTH WAS THAT CONVERSATION NOT HELD IN CHAIR WOODS HEALTH COMMITTEE. THAT'S YOUR JOB AS LEGISLATORS NOT A SINGLE PERSON HERE I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE NARRATIVE SOME OF YOU LIKE TO PUSH. NOT A SINGLE PERSON HERE BELIEVES THAT S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO CAN BE SIGNED INTO LAW THE WAY IT IS NOW. IT NEEDS TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND AT THE END OF THE JOY OUT OF THE DAY AS LEGISLATORS THAT'S YOUR JOB. TO LEGISLATE. WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THAT THERE ARE EIGHT PEOPLE IN THIS STATE THAT DIE EVERY DAY FROM LACK OF HEALTH CARE. THEY DON'T NEED TO DIE. THE REST ALL NEED TO SUFFER EVERYONE HERE KNOWS OF AT LEAST SOMEONE WHO WAS AT LEAST SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE. IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT WAY. IN THOSE PEOPLE NEED FIGHTERS THEY DON'T NEED EXCUSES. INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE BILL AND SAYING WELL WHAT ABOUT WAIVERS WE WANT YOU TO WORK TO CREATE THAT PARALLEL FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT MICHAEL LIGHT HE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HOW FUNDING MECHANISMS MAY NOT BE GOOD OR NOT WE WANT YOU TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS AND PUT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE SO WE CAN COME TO A BILL THAT TRULY GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE. NOT COVERAGE CARE TO EVERYONE IS A RIGHT SO I'M ASKING YOU ALL PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING. PRESSURE AROUND DAWN RELEASE S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO. ANTHONY GLAS A WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. BUT I'D LIKE TO MAKE TWO BRIEF COMMENTS. FIRST HOW WE PROBABLY SUPPORT THE HEALTH FROM PROPOSAL INCLUDED ME ASSEMBLY BUDGET BLUEPRINT UP PRESENTED BY MR STUDIO AND THE CALIFORNIA GROUP POLICY CENTER. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VITAL OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ABOLISHES MEDICAL REDLINING AND WELCOMES ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE IMMIGRATION STATUS IN INCOME. BUT SECONDLY AND THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT TODAY UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WILL ALSO CREATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE JOBS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. GOES TOWARDS THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE DISCUSS THE REMAINING ON SHORT. BY ENGAGING IN THE DISCUSSION WITH HOSPITALS AND CLINICS WITH DOCTORS AND NURSES AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. WITH EDUCATORS ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE POPULATIONS WERE SEEKING TO UPLIFT AND COVER WITH HEALTH CARE ARE THE ONES WORK CARING FOR POP OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. ANY SERIOUS PROPOSAL TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HAS TO INCLUDE PATHWAYS OF OPPORTUNITY OUT INTO THE HEALTH SECTOR ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND BY THAT BY DOING THIS WE CAN ENSURE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ACTUALLY LEADS TO BETTER CARE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTINE THE DETAIL THAT THE COMMUNITY ADVOCATE. WITH THE SILICON VALLEY INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER. WE'RE ONE OF TO ANY LIT INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FROM HUMBLE DOWN TO SEND THE. SAN DIEGO.

THAT ISN'T ACHIEVED PROPOSITION. THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER HOURS. NINA. A LETTER THAT HE CAN RECEIVE MEDI CAL. THE LARGEST BECAUSE. THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRANT STATUS. HEALTHCARE IS FOR EVERYBODY AND IS BE. ENGINE MEAN ISSUE MONEY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M BRIAN STUMP FROM THE BOTTLE CALIFORNIA HAD SMALL CORPORATION HER I TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. EYES SINGLE PAYER NEEDS TO BE DONE. INSISTS SKETCH ONE CANADA WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PROVINCE POPULATION WISE. THEY GOT IT DONE UP THERE AND TOMMY DOUGLAS WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR OF SASKATCHEWAN WAS VOTED THE GREATEST CANADIAN OF ALL TIME. THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD GET IT DONE SOME DOCTORS WALKED OUT SOME OTHER DOCTORS WALKED IN THEIR WORK SO WELL THAT THE REST OF CANADA FOLLOWED SUIT. I DID A A TRIP ACROSS CANADA JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT CANADA'S CANADIANS THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I STARTED IN QUEBEC AND ONE ACROSS ONTARIO I TALKED WITH PEOPLE. IN STORES AND RESTAURANTS AND GAS STATIONS EVERY KIND OF TOM DICK AND HARRY. JUST WALKED UP TO HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CANADIAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. I TALKED OVER A HUNDRED CANADIANS. ALL FIVE SAID IT'S EXCELLENT EVERYONE ELSE THAT IS GOOD NO ONE WAS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES FOR HEALTH CARE. OF THE WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT THEY SAID WE GOT GOOD DOCTORS APPEAR IF WE HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WE GOING TO SEE THE DOCTOR. THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT NOW ENDIVE WE HAVE SOMETHING ELECTED THAT MIGHT TAKE TWO THREE MONTHS. OR SO OH THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ARE REGARDING. MEDICARE. WANT YOU GUYS JUST LET MEDICARE A BILL ON THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA DOCTORS. YOU HAVE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE LET MEDICARE BILL ON. IF THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BILLING HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TAKE CARE OF IT I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANY PROBLEM WITH MEDICARE ROOM MAKING SOME KIND OF. YOU KNOW A CHANGE TO HER MANICURE SYSTEM. JUST YOU KNOW LEAVE MEDICARE ALONE. A HEALTH CARE. IS HEALTH CARE AND INSURANCE IS A PROFIT MAKING A DEAL I HAD A BUSINESS I KNOW WHAT MARK UP BILLS. AND INSURANCE SIMPLY MARKS UP SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY EXPENSIVE AND MAKES A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND YOU GUYS GOT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THEATER YOUR YEAH BUYING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR AND. YOU NEED TO GO DIRECT AND BY AM HEALTH CARE SAVE A BUNDLE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR MARY BOGLE. I'M A FAMILY PHYSICIAN WHO TRAINED AND PRACTICED IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND THEN FOUR YEARS AGO I MOVED TO BRITISH COLUMBIA. I WANTED TO PRACTICE IN A SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT AND MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE AND I'M SORRY MISS WALDRON HAD TO STEP OUT THERE WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF HER CONCERNS ABOUT THE CANADIAN SYSTEM WHICH SOME OF. THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE ADDRESSED AS WELL. REGARDING EFFICIENCY. I HAVE AN ASSISTANT WHO WORKS ABOUT FOUR HOURS PER WEEK TO DO THE BILLING FOR MYSELF. MY PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUE AT OUR NURSE PRACTITIONER. I DON'T HAVE TO PAY MULTIPLE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES TO BILL FIRST MEDICARE OR THE PRIMARY INSURER. AND IN THE SECONDARY JUROR AND THEN CHASES THE PATIENT DOWN FOR THE LAST FEW DOLLARS. ALL THAT WASTE IS NOT. NOT WASTED IN CANADA IT'S WASTED HERE. THERE'S NO DEDUCTIBLE THERE'S NO CO PAYMENT. PATIENTS DON'T GET A MEDICAL BILL THERE'S NO MEDICAL BANKRUPTCY. I REGARDING QUALITY OF CARE I DON'T HAVE TO LIMIT THE SPECIALIST I SEND DEPICTION TO BECAUSE THE BEST DOCTOR IS NOT COVERED BY MY PATIENTS PLAN. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT MY PATIENT DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE EVERYBODY'S GOT INSURANCE. YES SIR AWAITS OF MY PATIENT WITH CHRONIC KNEE ARTHRITIS NEEDS A NEW REPLACEMENT SHE MAY NEED TO WAIT FOR MONTHS OR A YEAR. ABOUT ONE MY PATIENT FELL LAST MONTH AND HAD A COMPLEX FRACTURE RANKLE SHE HAD IMMEDIATE SURGERY BY AN EXCELLENT ORTHOPEDIST. AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY COPAYMENTS OR DEDUCTIBLES AND NO COST OTHER THAN HER SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER MONTH INSURANCE PAYMENT. SO MY CANCER PATIENTS OR SEEN AS QUICKLY IS NEEDED BY AN EXCELLENT TEAM OF ON COLLEGES AND THEY GET WORLD CLASS CARE. ANY PATIENT WITH AN URGENT OR LIFE THREATENING CONDITION IS CARED FOR IN A VERY TIMELY FASHION SET A PERFECT SYSTEM. OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAVE ELECTED PROBLEMS MAY HAVE TO WAIT. ENDS AND SO I THINK WE CAN DO IT HEARING KICK IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THEY DID IN IN CANADA. SO LET'S DO IT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LOOSELY ESTHER I AM A REGISTERED NURSE FROM EUREKA CALIFORNIA I PRACTICE IN AN IN PATIENT REHABILITATION. UNIT. WE PRIMARILY HAVE PATIENTS THAT ARE STROKE. MAJOR TRAUMA OR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. I'VE BEEN. ABLE TO COME TO A SEVERAL OF THESE. HEARING SO FAR AND I THANK YOU FOR THE THIRTY PLUS HOURS THAT YOU'VE PUT IN LISTENING TO ALL THE TESTIMONY. BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE NURSES ALREADY KNEW WE LIVE WITH A BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT IS NOT DOING THE JOB IT SHOULD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. QUITE A BIT EARLIER IN THE IN THE TESTIMONY HERE WITH THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS SOME HE SAID THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM. I LIKE TO SAY I AM NOT ON THE SAME TEAM I AM NOT ON THE SAME TEAM WITH ANY. HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY THAT BRINGS NO VALUE TO OUR SYSTEM BUT MAKES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR I AM NOT ON THAT TEAM. THIS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WE HAVE ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW A VERY SIMPLE VERY ELEGANT VERY WONDERFUL FIX FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BE THEY DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED. THAT'S S. B.

AND YOU DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND I THANK YOU LIKE EVERYONE ELSE FOR. BIRD LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS IN WAYS THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS GO FORWARD. HOWEVER WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING BROKEN YOU DON'T GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NAY SAYERS AND SAY WHY WE CAN'T DO THIS YOU GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOLUTIONS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS OF SINGLE PAYER AND HEALTH CARE'S. SYSTEMS THAT WORK ALL AROUND THE WORLD. MY SON MARRIED A GERMAN WOMAN SO NOW I HAVE INTIMATE. EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT EUROPEANS ARE EXPERIENCE AND I'M ASKING WHY OR WHY DOZEN.

FIVE FIFTY TWO WOULD BE POSSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU KEEP IGNORING THOSE THOSE THOSE POSSIBILITIES AND THOSE ANSWERS. AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. I'M SORRY ALSO SHE'S GONE BECAUSE. WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THEIR DEDUCTIBLE DEDUCTIBLES AND CHOOSE TO EAT OR PAY THEIR RENT BEFORE THEY TAKE HEALTH CARE.

YOU'RE YOU'RE MY LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE OR I IN OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL YOU PLEASE RELEASE THE BILL AND WORKED ON IT ALREADY. THIS THIS IS NOTHING NEW YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THE ONLY IT AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE AND THE THING IS YOU ONLY LISTENED ABOUT S. B. FIVE SIXTY TO FOR LIKE ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME. AND THAT IS THE ANSWER. WE HAD WE HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THE PEOPLE WHO RAISED THEIR HAND. AND SAID THAT A WELL YOU NAM HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT YOUR BUDGET HYPOCRITES. IF HEALTH CARE IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT THAT HEALTHCARE WAS A HUMAN RIGHT IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED IN SINGLE PAYER YOU BE WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW AND YOU WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE. BLOWING HOT AIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY AFTER YOU'VE HEARD THAT. I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY CONDOLENCES THAT YOU'VE BEEN MANIPULATED. IN TO COVERING OVER FOR WHATEVER THE GOVERNOR AND THE SPEAKER HAVE FELT WAS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE BEEN GETTING WHICH WE HAVE RECORDED. IN TERMS OF THEIR CAMPAIGN AND THEY'RE THEIR THEIR. THEIR ROUTE RESOURCES. HEALTH INDUSTRY. IT'S REALLY OBJECTIONABLE AND IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR I LIKE TO BE BLUNT ABOUT A FEW THINGS NUMBER ONE WE DO NOT HAVE A BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IT'S WORKING PERFECTLY IT'S WORKING PERFECTLY FOR THE ARCHITECTS OF THAT SYSTEM THE BILLIONAIRES AND THE PLUTOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT HAVE A MUCH HIGHER OBJECTIVE THAN MONEY THEIR OBJECTIVE IS POLITICAL CONTROL AND WE ARE IN A CRISIS RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY BEEN BOUGHT. BY THE COKE NETWORK TO ESSENTIALLY OVERCOME THE DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATION OF THIS COUNTRY. SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE IS THE ONE AND ONLY UNIVERSAL WEDGE. AGAINST THAT ANTI DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVE THAT IS SWAMPING US WE DO NOT HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM IT IS A BREAKING SYSTEM WE DO NOT HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE HAVE A MEDICAL MANAGEMENT RANSOM SYSTEM. HEALTH CARE IS NOT FOR SALE. IT IS NOT FOR SALE WE DON'T HAVE A VOCABULARY FOR HEALTH CARE. I'M A PHYSICIAN I'M A MEMBER OF THE STATE. POSITIONS FOR A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM STEERING COMMITTEE WE HAVE THE CHAPTER HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE'RE AVAILABLE TO YOU I URGE YOU AS ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOOD UP TO SPEAK. LET THIS BILL GO FORCED RENDON TO PUT THIS BILL INTO A PLACE WHERE THIS KIND OF HEARING CAN REALLY MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS MODEST HIM ATHENA FROM ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS SIXTY THREE WHICH ANTHONY RENDON REPRESENTS. IF YOU. IF YOU IF IT'S SOUND LIKE A REPEATING MYSELF FROM THE OTHER TIMES AT A SPOKEN AT THE HEARING A PROBABLY IS BECAUSE I AM REPEATING MYSELF ON THE ONLY ONE HERE REPRESENTING MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND I WAS KEEP ON SHOWING UP. AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IN THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY FACE AT EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU HAVE A HEARING. I WAS BORN RAISED AND LIVE IN AN AREA THAT WAS CONTAMINATED BY EXCITE TECHNOLOGIES FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. OUR SOIL IS STILL CONTAMINATED TO THIS DAY WITH TOXIC WASTE DUMP LEVELS OF LEAD ARSENIC BENZENE CADMIUM CHROMIUM SIX ONE THREE BUTADIENE JUST TO MENTION A FEW. ALL OF THESE CHEMICALS AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CANCERS MISCARRIAGES BIRTH DEFECTS LIFELONG DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN. OUR COMMUNITY IS HARD WORKING PREDOMINANTLY LATINO WORKING CLASS LOWER MIDDLE CLASS DOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED INICIA UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED. WHEN WE SPEAK OF UNDER INSURED THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT THE ACA HAS NOT HELPED. INSURANCE IS NOT EQUAL TO HEALTH CARE. I AM SELF EMPLOYED AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY ASSISTANCE MY PREMIUM JUST RECENTLY INCREASED TO TWENTY THREE POINT THREE PERCENT THIS JANUARY FROM THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS. TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH AND MY DEDUCTIBLE IS SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH THE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR COPAY WITH RATES LIKE THESE I THINK TWICE ABOUT GETTING THE PREVENTIVE CARE SHOULD BE GETTING. AND I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES IN MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE I'M INSURED. IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IS THAT WITH THESE RESIDENT HAVING MOVED IN AND OUT OF OUR DISTRICT THROUGHOUT THE DECADES THE ONLY WAY TO COVER ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS ON GOING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE. IS THROUGH THE SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL COMPREHENSIVE INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE S. B. FIVE SIX TWO OFFERS PLEASE HERTZ RENT ON TO FREE THE BELL AND ALLOW IT TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS PLEADS. HELLO DOCTOR ARAMBULA. HI IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY I JUST TURNED FORTY YEARS OLD BIRTHDAY. OKAY NOW TO THAT TO WHY I'M HERE. FIRST OFF. I WOULD YOU KNOW JUST WANT TO REITERATE I CAN'T HELP BUT DO SO. THAT WE ARE TO. IN AN ORDER FOR MORE INSURANCE IN ORDER FOR MORE. PHYSICIANS TO TAKE MEDI CAL. WHICH IS OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE NEED TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR EDUCATION. THIS ALSO SHOULD BE APPLIED TO. PSYCHOLOGISTS NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS. SECOND. IF YOU. GOT ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF MONEY THAT YOU RECEIVED FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES. IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE INSURANCE COMPANIES. SUCK IT JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SOCKS WITH A CAPITAL S. U. C. K. S. IT'S VERY VERY. YET I'M AGAINST THE INSURANCE COMPANY WE NEED TO TAKE THE FOR PROFITS OUT OF IT. AND YOU KNOW WHY WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE D. MH SEE. IS BECAUSE THEY OVERSEE ALL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WHICH WE WANT TO GET RID OF. WHY NOT GET RID OF THE MANAGED CARE OF GET RID OF ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES? I'LL GET RID OF D. MHC AND. PUT ALL OF THE SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. IN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE SAME ONE THAT DOES MEDICARE OWL AND ENTER CAO. AND I'M TRYING TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. SECOND. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE. AND. I WANT TO ALSO LET YOU KNOW THAT AS A MEDIC HELP PATIENT I HAVE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE WITH MEDICARE BEING MY PRIMARY INSURANCE. I CANNOT GET ANY COUNSELING SERVICES PAID UNDER MEDI CAL I CAN UNDER MEDICARE BUT THAT THERE'S A CO PAY IN FACT ONLY FEDERALLY QUALIFIED CENTERS. CAN GIVE ME COUNSELING AND IT'S NOT REALLY THEY DON'T WORK WITH ANY SPECIALIZED POPULATION THEY WORK. FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND I NEED SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH THE DEVELOPMENTALLY. DISABLED SO AGAIN. IF YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES JUST SO YOU CAN GET ELECTED. THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA LOOK. YOU WORK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ELECT YOU NOT FOR THOSE THAT WHO GAVE YOU MONEY I'M ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR. OFFICE MYSELF IN AND FOR TO. IMPORT IN. FOUR TO SIX YEARS FOR EITHER SENATE OR ASSEMBLY AND I WILL NOT BE ASKING INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR MONEY AND FINALLY I WANTED. ASK A QUESTION OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS TO THE WITNESSES WHO SPOKE IN WHAT ABOUT. WHAT ABOUT? COMMUNICATE ALL AND CAL MANY CAN THAT. MAYBE WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM AS WELL THANKS. THANK YOU RECKON HAVE TO PROTECT. THANK YOU CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY CONSUMERS HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS WHO SERVED SIX AND A HALF MILLION PATIENTS. COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS MY THANK YOU ALL FOR THE CONVENING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE HEARINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE. AND THE CHALLENGE I WE ALL APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE BEFORE YOU AND WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS. WITH YOU ON THIS CONVERSATION. I JUST WANTED TO HIT TWO QUICK POINTS. FIRST OF ALL IN LIGHT OF THE HEARINGS THAT YOU ALL HAVE CONVENED AND THE INTERACTION OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO AS OF THE HEALTH CENTERS TO CONVENE. SORT OF A A TABLE OF THEIR OWN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM SHOULD LOOK LIKE. GOINGFORWARD IN THE FUTURE AND THAT BABY THEY THINK THAT A GOOD MODEL TO PERHAPS LOOK AT IN THIS INSTANCE IS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER MODEL. WHICH IS THE MODEL THAT THE. THAT FOR PRIMARY HELD FOR EXCUSE ME PRIMARY CARE HEALTH DELIVERY AVAILABLE TO ALL PEOPLE A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES OPEN DOOR ACCESS COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES LOCATED WHERE THE PATIENT IS LOCATED. CULTURAL CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND CONSUMER DIRECTED AND SECONDLY I JUST WANTED TO ALSO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE WHOLE FOR ALL PROPOSAL THAT YOU ALL. WERE PRESENTED WITH EARLIER TO EXPAND MEDICAL ACCESS TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WE CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THE HUMAN. HI EVERYONE. MY NAME IS JUSTIN SAMPSON I CAME UP HERE FROM ORANGE COUNTY I TRAVEL TEN HOURS BY BUS AND CARPOOL JUST TO GET HERE. JUST TO LET YOU ALL KNOW STOP MAKING IT FEW FIFTH IN RELEASED THE BILL NOW. BEING SOMEBODY WHO IS AN ACTIVIST IN ORANGE COUNTY AND A CANDIDATE FOR THE STATE SENATE AYE I FIRST WANTED TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT. THE NURSES HERE HAVE BEEN DOING GREAT WORK AND UNFORTUNATELY. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD JUST JIM WOOD ANTHONY RENDON HAVE REALLY SHOWN THEM NOT THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE SO. I'M HERE TO LET THEM KNOW THAT I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'VE DONE I RESPECT EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. AND THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD LOOK MOVE FORWARD IN PASSED SINGLE PAYER RIGHT NOW. THE REASON I'M HERE OF FIGHTING FOR SINGLE PAYER IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED WITH END STAGE BREAST CANCER RATHER THAN SPENDING HER TIME FIGHTING. HER CONDITION SHE SPENT PART OF HER TIME FIGHTING HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKING SURE THAT SHE GOT THE TREATMENT THAT SHE NEEDED. SHE ALSO HAD. TO DEAL WITH COPAYS MY MOM AND I A WHERE. WE'RE DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY PRECARIOUS LE CONDITIONS AND WE WERE NEARLY HOMELESS. MY SO WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES DO WE PAY THE TWENTY DOLLARS TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR OR. IF IT. GROCERIES FOR THE WEEK OR THE RENT OR OR WHAT NOT. BUT IF THE CHOICE THAT NOBODY HAS. THE MAKING I BEEN WALKING TALKING TO COMMUNITY BE OF. IN RESIDENCE IN MY IN MY MY DISTRICT TALKING TO THEM ABOUT. THEIR NEEDS AND THESE ARE CHOICES THAT THEY PASSED TO MAKE TO. BOB THEY'RE FED UP WITH THE SYSTEM THAT TO HAVE PUT CORPORATIONS AHEAD OF THEM THAT. AND PUT. THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THEY HAVE GOTTEN FROM HEALTH CARE. COMPANIES BEFORE THEY HAVE. PUT NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE. AND FINALLY WHAT THE FINAL% SECONDS I'VE GOT LEFT I'D REALLY WANT TO REALLY STRESS THE IDEA THAT. MANY PEOPLE HERE SUCH AS JIM WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED IDEA THAT THEY BELIEVE HEALTH CARE. IF THE HUMAN RIGHT WELL. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HERE'S FOR WORKS FOR YOU PUT UP OR SHUT UP RELIEF THE BILL RESPECT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS KNUCKLE FOR RENDON TOO BY THE WAY. REALLY THE BILL RESPECT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND LET'S GET TO WORK NEED NURSES MYSELF EVERYONE ELSE IS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE THANK YOU. MARY WE'RE NOT NEVADA COUNTY AND MY BEEN DEAD EVERY ONE OF THESE MEETINGS AND. I I JUST WANT TO TELL FOLKS EYES SPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE WATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT. I'M TO DAYS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE COMMITTEE ALLOWED SINGLE PAYER SENATE BILL FIVE SIX TWO TO BE PRESENTED. ALL THESE HOURS AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO. SO PLEASE RELEASE THE BALLOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS CYNTHIA BROWN I'M A CANCER PATIENT FROM LOS ANGELES WAS OPTED FOR SURGERY WITHOUT CHEMO OR RADIATION. I'VE GONE THROUGH TO PAINFUL SURGERIES AND IS A LOW INCOME MEDI CAL PATIENTS. IT IS NO PROBLEM TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ADDICTIVE OPIOID PAINKILLERS. HOWEVER IF I CHOOSE A SAFER ALTERNATIVE OF T. T. CBD OIL THAT WILL COST ME SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH IN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FROM A NONPROFIT. FIFTY EIGHT C. CBD OIL MEDICAL MARIJUANA WERE INTEGRATED INTO THE SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND OTHERS WITH SERIOUS AILMENTS. VAST SUMS OF MONEY WOULD BE SAFE BECAUSE COSTLY REHAB FOR OPIOID ADDICTS WOULD NOT BE NEEDED ADDITIONALLY LONG TERM EFFECTS WOULD BE AVOIDED. ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL INTEREST WOULD OPPOSE THIS REFORM FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. OPIOIDS YIELD BIG MONEY FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. BLOOD TEST TO SCREEN FOR CANCER ARE ACCORDING TO MY ONCOLOGIST ONLY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT ACCURATE HE INFORMED ME THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL CANCER INDUSTRY DOES NOT CARE TO PUT ANY MONEY INTO IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF CANCER SCREENING. BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS PROFITABLE AS TREATING PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED CANCER. I HOPE THAT UNDER A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THIS COULD BE REFORM SAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I IMAGINE. LET'S REFORM THIS BROKEN SYSTEM IS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE. I GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ADRIANA MORA AND HERE ON THE BEHALF FOR THAT THE NO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO ADVANCE TO PROTECT WHAT THEY KNOW HOW. TO POLICY ADVOCACY TO BUILD HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WE BELIEVE AT THE WELLNESS AND HEALTH CALIFORNIANS DEPENDS ON ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES. WITH REGULAR MEDICAL CARE AND VISITS TO THE DOCTOR WE CAN PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM PAINFUL EXPENSIVE AND PREVENTABLE MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITHOUT HEALTHCARE ACCESS MANY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. DO NOT SEE CARE BECAUSE OF FEAR DEPUTATION THEY SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN A COULD BE EASILY TREATABLE. REMAIN UNAWARE OF EXISTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS TYPE TWO DIABETES AND THEY END UP RELYING ON BENDED CARE FOR ALL HEALTH NEEDS. AND END UP ACCUMULATING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICAL DEBT. AND DELAY CARE WHICH MAY LEAD TO DEATH IN A TIME WHERE OUR NATIONAL LEADERS SEEK TO TARGET THE POOR AND DENIES BONA POPULATIONS CALIFORNIA KNOWS BETTER. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER FOR CHANGE WE MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD AND ASSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE AT THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATOR. TO IS THE CHIEF HEALTH FOR. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS PAUL BROOKS A RETIREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND A MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES CW A NINE ONE ONE NIGHT. I'M ALSO THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE ON THE UC WORKING GROUP ON RETIREE HEALTH INSURANCE. MANY EMPLOYEES ARE LAID OFF YOUNGER THAN AGE SIXTY FIVE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IRONICALLY. SUCH AS PROBLEMS LIKE HEALTHCARE. WELL HEALTH ISSUES. MY. THAT FIND AT THEIR AGE THEY CANNOT BE REHIRED CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE AND DESCENDED TO BANKRUPTCY AND POVERTY. THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE IS CONTINUE TO CONTINUAL ISSUE BOTH OF THE UNION BARGAINING TABLE AND WITH FACULTY WHERE IT'S CLEAR EMPLOYEES SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD THE INCREASE. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FROM YOU SEE AND OTHER EMPLOYEES OF PLAYERS IS TO REDUCE PLANS COVERAGE OR PUSH THE COSTS ON TO RETIREES WHO COULD NOT AFFORD THE INCREASED COST. SINGLE PAYER SOLVES THESE PROBLEMS AND REMOVES THE HEALTHCARE ISSUE FROM THE UNION BARGAINING TABLE SUPPORT SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE AND RELEASE. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS PAUL ROCKED AB I HAVE BEEN A NURSE PRACTITIONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIRST INTO A LAKE AND THEN IN CHICO AND THEN AND WILLIAMS FOR. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX I AM WEIRDLY TO DO ANY KIND OF TESTIMONY ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO COVER FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE I WHAT I WOULD IMAGINE SPEED DATING MUST BE LIKE. BUT I'LL TRY TO COVER A FEW THINGS HERE I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF P. NH P. PHYSICIANS FOR NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO AS A NURSE PRACTITIONER. I AM ALSO A SECRET PATIENT VICTIM. OF WHAT WE ERRONEOUSLY CALLED. A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OUT RATHER THAN A PROFIT CENTER FOR ILLNESS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HAD. A GREATER POPULAR SUPPORT FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING VIA THE. SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO IN THIS STATE THAN YOU'VE EVER HAD FOR ANYTHING A PLURALITY OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE FOR OUR FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. OWNER FIRST STATE THAT THE EVIDENCE AS OPPOSED TO THE ADVERTISING NARRATIVE DISAGREES WITH ANTHONY RIGHTS HOWEVER WELL INTENTIONED. ASSERTION THAT THE ACA AND SINGLE PAYER ARE SOMEHOW ON A CONTINUING. THE ACA WAS A MARKET ADJUSTMENT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. DID BENEFIT MANY PEOPLE YES. DID A QUESTION THE BASIC FOUNDATION OF. THAT ACCESS IS A PRIVILEGE BASED ON ABILITY TO PAY SUBSIDIZED OR NOT. NO. YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME CLINICIAN BURNOUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT MARKET ADJUSTMENTS LIKE THE ACA OCCUPIED AN INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNT OF MY LIFE AND MY STAFF'S LIFE. IN DIRECT CARE TIME AND NO AMOUNT OF TWEAKING THAT SYSTEM WILL IMPROVE EITHER MY PATIENTS ABILITY TO GET CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. OR MY ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. AND THAT'S. PART OF AN AND I'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS QUICK BUT I REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE. WHAT MY REMARKS ARE SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY TWO PROVIDES A FOUNDATION AND A FRAMEWORK TO ELIMINATE THE LABOR WOES AND SMALL BUSINESS CONSTRUCTION THAT YOU WERE ALERTED TO? AND ON THE ISSUE OF MD INCOMES. I LOOKED IT UP TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FAMILY PRACTICE AVERAGES IN CANADA. ARE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY'RE COMPARABLE IF NOT SUPERIOR TO THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE PASS FIVE SIXTY TWO. A HELLO ESTEEMED COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY HINDSIGHT ON THE MOM AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE AND POLITICAL DIRECTOR. FOR A DE CW A LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN WHERE THE UNION FOR. DATA RESEARCHERS IN THAT CAMPUSES OF THE TEN CAMPUSES AND FIVE MEDICAL CENTERS OF THE UC SYSTEM. I AND THREE NATIONAL LABORATORIES IN THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I WANTED TO SEE. ECHO THE REMARKS THAT ARE RETIREE PAUL BROOKS HAD MENTIONED AS FAR AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. IT THE HEALTHCARE COSTS AND COST SHIFTING REALLY HARMS LABOR PEACE IN A VERY SUBSTANTIVE WAY AND TRUST ME WE RATHER BE BARGAINING ABOUT OTHER ISSUES. BUT WE'RE FORCED INTO A CORNER IN THIS WAY TO REALLY FOCUS RIGHT NOW WHERE IT GO IN THE MIDDLE OF BARGAINING CNA AND ALSO ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF BARGAINING IN THIS IS A VERY BIG STICKING POINT. YOU SEE IS NOW CONTEMPLATING TUITION INCREASES AND THE OVERLY OWNER ONEROUS NATURE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH CARE COSTS IS FORCING THEM IN ADDITION TO STATE DIVESTMENT. IS HARMING THE YOU SEE MISSION AS AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TEACHING RESEARCH AND SERVICE IN FACT YOU SEE HAS CREATED ITS OWN INSURANCE COMPANY TO SOBER THE INCREASING COST CALLED YOU SEE CARES. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PERVERTED SYSTEM WERE UNDER WHERE IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO CREATE ITS OWN INSURANCE COMPANY TO TRY AND SUPPORT THE COST OVERRUNS OF OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WE'D RATHER BE HAVING TEACHING. RESEARCH PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE ATTAINING SO WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION I'VE BEEN TO ALL OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MEETINGS. I LEARNED A LOT THAT WAS GREAT BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THEY REVEALED IS THAT WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION AND THERE'S MORE TO TALK ABOUT AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS MORE. ITS RELEASE THE BELL S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS DAWN BENKLER MATURE SINGLE PAYER NO WE HAVE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND SINGLE PAYER NOW SO SINGLE PAYER SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. I WATCHED A BIT ALL THE HEARINGS. AND.

DO YOUR DAY JOBS RELEASED THE BILL SO WE COULD HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION THAT MEANS SOMETHING WITH FIVE SIXTY TWO WHEN. WHEN YOU SEE IT YOU EVER ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA. ASSEMBLY WILL COST THE OUR IT WAS PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IF.

HISTORY OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE. AND THE SOCIALIZED ASPECT OF OF A. FIRE DEPARTMENTS ETCETERA JUST TO HARK BACK TO THAT COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY THAT YOUNG LADY THERE I DON'T KNOW HER NAME. THE. IN LONDON THOUGH IT THE FIRST INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD GO IN STRONG ARM THE PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESSES ON THE STREET AND SAY. YOU REALLY NEED OUR FIRE INSURANCE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU KNOW YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE A FIRE. AND SOME OF THEM DID SO THAT WAS FORCING PEOPLE TO BUY FIRE INSURANCE AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE. THE PARTICULAR COMPANIES FIRE INSURANCE THEY WOULD NOT INDEED. FIRE. NEED INSURANCE COMPANIES AS THEY WERE THEN OF WORK CROOKS AND. THEY STILL ARE. THANK YOU PLEASE PLEASE SUPPORT THIS AND OF PASSED THE BILL FORWARD. HUMAN. HI CHRIS FOR SCIENCES POLICY ADVOCATE WITH TRAILER THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS HERE TO SPEAK ON THE HOUSE FOR ALL. PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WE KNOW THROUGH OUR CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP THROUGH ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IMMIGRANTS TYPICALLY I HAPPEN TO WORK IN VARIOUS AYE SECTORS BUT SOMETIMES I'LL WORK IN SECTORS THAT DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE INSURANCE OR. ANY TYPE OF ALL FORMAL CARE FOR THEM. WE KNOW THIS THROUGH THE ORGAN ORGANIZING THAT WE DO WITH WITH DAY LABORERS AND ALSO DOMESTIC WORKERS. I'LL BE NOT SUCH WE WOULD. URGE THAT WE WOULD STRONG AND URGE LA THAT LEGISLATORS SUPPORT THE HOUSE FOR ALL HOW PROPOSAL. AND I THAT'S ABOUT IT TO GIVE A GOOD DAY. SUSAN COLOR I'M A REGISTERED NURSE I'VE BEEN A NURSE FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND MOSTLY IN INTENSIVE CARE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE I'VE SEEN A FEW THINGS. COM AND IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER SPEAKER RENDON OWN AND YOU CO CHAIRS HAVE SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE DOLLARS ARE NOT OUTLINED FOR S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. ACTUALLY IN FACT TO SEE COMMISSIONED A COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT OFFER DETAILED SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FINANCING OF S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. AS THE SPEAKER KNOWS GIVEN THE NEED FOR A PROPER STUDY AND THE TIGHT TIMELINES FOR ACTION IN THE SENATE. IN THE IN THE YEAH IN THE SENATE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE A FULL FINANCING PROPOSAL BEFORE THE SENATE BUT IT WAS FULLY OUR INTENT TO INCLUDE FINANCIAL PROPOSAL. AS THE BILL WAS CONSIDERED AN AMENDED IN THE ASSEMBLY. IN FACT THE SPEAKER'S OWN STAFF MEMBER TOLD CNA NOT TO PUT THE FINANCING IN THE BILL UNTIL IT GOT TO THE PROCREATION IS. COMMITTEE AND THEN THE SPEAKER. FROZE THE BILL IN THE RULES COMMITTEE. THAT IS A TRULY DISINGENUOUS WAY TO DEAL WITH US THE PUBLIC TELL A BILL SPONSOR NOT TO PUT FINANCING IN THE BILL UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY FREEZE THE BILL. PREVENTING THE FINANCING BEING PUT IN THE BILL AND THEN DISHONESTLY CLAIMED THAT THE BILL IS IN ADEQUATE BECAUSE IT HAS NO FINANCING UNIT. YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYONE WE'RE WATCHING YOU AND WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO NEEDS TO BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT ON DEMOCRATICALLY BOTTLED UP YOU SAY YOU BELIEVE IN HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT. THE DEFINITION OF A RIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT'S MORAL ETHICAL AND JOTS. SO DO THE RIGHT THING. PAST S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. WE NEED GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE FOR ALL NOT GUARANTEED INSURANCE THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JACOB MASON I AM RUNNING FOR THE CALIFORNIA SENATE AGAINST DOCTOR RICHARD PAN HERE IN DISTRICT SIX ARM. AND THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING AS WELL. THE SP FIVE SIXTY TWO ISSUE HE IS AGAINST IT IS PROBABLY THE REASON HE'S GONNA LOSE IN THE PRIMARY I WOULD SAY I IN JUNE HOPEFULLY. SO ARE AYE I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING JOHN CHIANG WHO IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR USE THE TREASURER BECAUSE HE FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER AND HE'S SAID RECENTLY I THINK LAST WEEK. THAT HE KNOWS HOW CALIFORNIA CAN MOVE FORWARD SINGLE PAYER AND HE KNOWS HOW TO BUDGET IS SO JUST TALK TO THE TREASURER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE. ACCORDING TO HIM HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO DO THIS. COURTING IS TWITTER IT'S RIGHT ON THEIR. SO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE IS SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER PER CAPITA THAN ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM. NOW I I DON'T KNOW WHO LOSES WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE COSTS I'M NOT. THAT MUCH OF AN EXPERT BUT. IF YOU LOOK AT ITALY. FOR EXAMPLE. PULLING UP THE STATISTIC HERE. THEY SPEND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PER CAPITA FOR TOTAL UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE SPEND ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CAPITA UNITED STATES ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE FOR ONLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE PERFECT COVERAGE I MEAN NO ONE HAS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES SO. BUT IT. I GUESS SOMEONE TIME HERE. I DID NOTICE SOME THINGS THAT I THINK OR NEED TO BE LOOKED AT WITH THIS WHICH IS. WORDEN DOT SAME RING TO COVER PEOPLE IN THE TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY WITH THIS THE I SAW AND OF SO THAT WOULD BE A DOWNGRADE SO THAT NEEDS I THINK COVERAGE. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. ARE WE GOING TO USE THIS FOR SOME TYPE A GUN CONTROL THING WHICH I'D BE AGAINST PERSONALLY BECAUSE I I JUST CAN'T MAKE THEM FRENCH CANADA HERE BUT. SO I I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN I THINK CALIFORNIA'S ON THE TORIES FOR GUN CONTROL LIKE IT TO SEE THAT HAPPENING WITH A WHAT'S A GOVERNMENT DO HEALTH CARE. THEREFORE WILL USE IT FOR GUN CONTROL ANYWAYS I IN FACT HURTS ON TALK ABOUT THEIR DAY. JUST MY OPINION OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU. MY NAME IS GAIL PENA RHONDA I'M A VOLUNTEER FOR SHE AND I.

RICKOVER APPEAR PREMIUMS WERE ASTRONOMICAL. WE LOOK TOWARD COVER CALIFORNIA THE LEAST EXPENSIVE PLAN I COULD OBTAIN WHICH WAS A BRONZE PLAN. AN ANNUAL PREMIUM TOTALS OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT WAS A FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE PER PERSON. IT WORKED OUT TO BE THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF OUR GROSS. YES GROSS INCOME IN PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES. THE PREMIUMS WERE MORE THAN A HOUSE PAYMENT. FORTUNATELY HE BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE DISABILITY LAST FALL. ON ANTHEM BLUE CROSS PULLED OUT OF MY COUNTY AT THE END A TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BLUESHIELD IS MY ONLY OPTION AND THERE IS NO COMPETITION. MY PREMIUM FOR INSURANCE JUST FOR MYSELF IS NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT DOLLARS. A MONTH.

BUT IS TO BE INTRODUCED AGAIN TODAY A DIFFERENT WAY WHICH IS THE ISSUE OF I WELCOME JUST CALL MEDICAL APARTHEID IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. YOU BROUGHT UP AN INTERESTING THING WHICH IS THE PROBLEM OF THE SUPPLY. OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

SOME PEOPLE FEEL IT AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T IS THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL TAKE MEDI CAL. SO. PEOPLE WHO TAKE ME WHO HAVE MEDI CAL. ARE. IT WOULD MANY KIDS ARE ARE THE VICTIMS I WOULD SAY OF APARTHEID OF MEDICAL PARTED IN THE STATE ARE THE ONES FEELING THAT RIGHT NOW. SO. I THINK THE PEOPLE HAVE SAID TODAY THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO DO INCREMENTAL REFORMS AND LOOK FOR A BIG PICTURE THING. ALL AT ONCE. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT ACTUALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE BAND WITH TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS. FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE WELL INTENDED SOMETIMES YOU GET THE RIGHT. DIAGNOSIS IN THE WRONG DIRE TREATMENT. RECOMMENDED THAT THE IMMIGRATION AT ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE TODAY WHO ARE ADVOCATING MEDI CAL EXPO.

ARE IF YOU NEED MORE CRAFTS LIKE ISSUE GRAPHS ABOUT ENTREPRENEURS OTHER SILICON VALLEY TECHNOLOGY FOLKS AND PROGRAMMERS THAT NEW INVENTIONS AND NEW IDEAS BUT THEY'RE SCARED TO START NEW BUSINESSES AND HIRE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR EXISTING HEALTH CARE. I CAN SHOW YOU GRAPHS AND PIE CHARTS ABOUT HOW THE PLAYERS ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE AND. GETTING CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR PAYROLL I'M JUST HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT'S NOT TO PROVIDE A PLATINUM PLAN THAT'S BARELY TO PROVIDE ON AVERAGE JUST SILVER LEVEL PLAN. I CAN SHOW YOU PIE CHARTS OF HOW FAMILIES ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE EVERY YEAR AND THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FIGURE THAT WAS QUOTED EARLIER BY A PANELIST WAS ALARMING TO ME. THIS HEALTHCARE BILL THAT I SUPPORT S. B. SPIKE SIXTY TWO WOULD REPRESENT. THE LARGEST BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND FAMILIES THAT. WOULD.
