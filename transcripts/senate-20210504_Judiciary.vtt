REDUCE THE FREQUENCY. INTENSITY

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:42.328
AND SCALE OF FUTURE WILDFIRES.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.030
EXPERTS TELL US THE CALIFORNIA

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:47.066
SHOULD BE TREATING A MINIMUM OF

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:47.700
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.635
WILDLAND WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:53.005
EACH YEAR. THE FACT IS.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:54.841
CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO TREAT A

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:55.808
FRACTION OF THAT AMOUNT

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.443
ANNUALLY WHILE OTHER STATES

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.945
SUCH AS FLORIDA TREAT AS MANY

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:02.682
AS TWO MILLION ACRES A YEAR.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:03.616
ONE MIGHT ASK WHY IS CALIFORNIA

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:06.686
LAG. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.287

BOSSES OF PROPERTY OWNERS FACE

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.791
SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL COSTS AND

SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ONE OF THE

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:19.832
PRIMARY CONCERNS FOR

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.701

HIGH FIRE SUPPRESSION COST

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.811

PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND THAT IS

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:38.150
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO GETTING

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.655

UNTIL THE FIRE IS GOTTEN OUT OF

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.597
CONTROL. AND FRANKLY THAT COULD

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:55.701
BE TOO LATE. AS SB THREE THREE

I'D SAY. OUR SYSTEM CENTER IS

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:51.663
THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:54.966
ON HOW WE MANAGE FORESTLANDS IN

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.569

NOW BUT- THIS BILL IS A SMALL

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.848
PIECE OF A VERY COMPLEX PUZZLE.

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:11.483
AND PART OF THAT PUZZLE IS

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:12.350

TO THAT MILLION FOR TARGET BUT

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:19.891
I DO THINK THAT IN THE LONG RUN

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:21.926
THAT KIND OF THE SCALE IS WHAT

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.962
WE SHOULD AIM FOR IN ORDER TO

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:25.797
FULLY TREAT AND REALLY

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.565
DRAMATICALLY ALTER A SITUATION

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.113
MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I WAS GOING TO

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.215
SPEAK TO THE BILL BUT I THINK I

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.551
WILL ALSO INCORPORATE OF THE

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.153
CONCERN OF SENATOR WHITE HOUSE

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:51.289
SKIER IN MY COMMENTS BECAUSE-

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:53.725
THE- THE THIRD CALLER WAS

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:57.328
EXACTLY RIGHT. THE THERE'S- A

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.763
HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.998
SUPPRESSION THAT IS BROUGHT UP

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.866
AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND IS

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.269
LED TO. WHAT NEEDS TO BE A

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.437
MAJOR CHANGE IN WHAT WE DO TO

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:09.340
PREVENT FIRE. THE STATE HAS

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.876
BEEN DOING IT YEAR BY YEAR AND

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:15.914
THE CURRENT GOAL. WAS TO DO

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:16.548
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:19.217
PRESCRIBED FIRE IT UP- IN A

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.653
YEAR. AND I THINK WHAT SENATOR

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:24.222
DODD SAID AT SOME POINT IN THIS

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.858
PROCESS. IS THE ONLY A HUNDRED

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.293
AND TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.295
THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.863
ACRES WAS ABLE TO BE DONE

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.464
BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:37.068
AT PLAY- IN THIS. AND I THINK

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:40.605
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI RAISES

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:41.839
THE ISSUE THAT'S CORRECT. OUR

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:43.608
WHICH IS THAT IT MAY WELL NOT

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.843
BE ENOUGH AND IT MAY WELL HAVE

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.680
TO OVERTIME BE HIGHER. AND THE

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.481
REAL THING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:52.817
DOING EVEN THOUGH RESOURCES NOW

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.252
HAS A FIVE YEAR PLAN WE'VE BEEN

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:55.820
DOING IT YEAR TO YEAR AND I'VE

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.589
A BILL TO PUT TOGETHER A FIVE

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.691
YEAR PLAN. BUT THAT'S AND

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:00.658
THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:02.794
WITNESSES CALLED IN NY SENATOR

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.762
WHITE HOUSE YET SAYS QUESTION

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:08.066
WHICH WAS ON THE POLICY. OF OF

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:09.834
FIRE PREVENTION BUT WHAT'S IN

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.669
FRONT OF US IN THE JURISDICTION

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.071
OF THE COMMITTEE. IS THE

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:15.707
LIABILITY PIECE THAT I THINK

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:17.508
THAT ORIGINALLY THERE WAS.

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:19.978
CONCERN ABOUT THE LIABILITY

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.512
SECTION AND I'M SURE ALL OF US

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:23.414
WOULD BE CONCERNED. IF WE

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:24.816
DIDN'T HAVE IT AND FIRES WERE

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:25.550
BURNING RIGHT AT OUR

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.151
CONSTITUENTS WITH NOBODY HAVING

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.254
ANY LIABILITY. AND I THINK

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.122
THROUGH THE WORK OF THE CHAIR

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:34.092
AND HIS STAFF AND SENATOR DODD

00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:35.627
AND HIS STAFF WE HAVE A

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:38.096
WORKABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT

00:31:38.162 --> 00:31:39.964
ALLOWS US TO MEET BOTH GOALS.

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.432
DUE TO THE FIRE PREVENTION PART

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.368
THAT EVERYBODY CALLED IN ABOUT

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.136
TO SEE A SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.804
WAS CONCERNED IF THE REAL

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.306
SUPPRESSOR IN THE NUMBER OF

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.074
ACRES THAT WAS BEING DONE WAS

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.110
THE LIABILITY ISSUE. AND IF

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:54.178
IT'S NOT THE NOT SOMETHING ON

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:56.047
THE POLICY LEVEL WE WILL HAVE

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.815
TO ADDRESS SEPARATELY AND I'M

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.617
SURE OVER TIME. THERE WILL BE

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.085
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WHAT

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.654
WAS SUPPOSED IS TOTALLY

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.122
WORKABLE BUT I THINK IT'S A

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:05.456
GOOD SOLUTION AND AT THE RIGHT

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.991
TIME I'M GONNA BE READY TO MOVE

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.026
THE BILL AND I REALLY

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.527
APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:13.431

COMMITTEE HERE AT- EVIDENCED BY

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:35.219
MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS- NOT THE

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:37.088
LEAST OF WHICH AT THE AUTHOR

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:38.589
INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP TIME

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:42.060
AFTER TIME IN THIS ARENA- AND

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.394
YOU'RE WORKING THROUGH THE

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.196
PROBLEMS THIS BILL IS THAT

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.431
PRESCRIBED FIRE IS NOT AN EASY

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:50.468
ISSUE ALWAYS- BUT I THINK THE

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:53.504
FRAMEWORK YOU PUT FOR TODAY. AS

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.073
GOING TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.641
I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT OF

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:58.142
CLARIFICATION IF I COULD WITH

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:01.746
THE AUTHOR MISTER CHAIR. SIR

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.982
THE BILL DOESN'T MANDATE OR-

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.352
IMPOSE PRESCRIBED FIRES IN ALL

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.120
THE COLLEGES AROUND THE STATE

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:10.788
CORRECT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.957
LIABILITY RELATED TO THE BURN

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.892
BOSSES WHO ARE CERTIFIED.

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:16.561
THROUGH THE PROCESS IS THAT

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:22.767
RIGHT. EVERY EVERY JURISDICTION

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.369
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:25.703
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO TRY TO

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.438
MANAGE FIRES IN THIS AREA THIS

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:30.908
JUST HANDLES THE LIABILITY OF

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:31.509
PUTTING OUT THOSE FIRES SHOULD

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:34.178
ONE GET AWAY. SO I THINK

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:35.713
EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.081
SHOULD BE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.349
ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WHAT

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.784
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS WE

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.819
TRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT OR

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.221
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR IN CAL

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.923
FIRE. TO BE THE DECIDERS ON

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.325
WHERE THESE THINK WHERE THIS IS

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.560
APPROPRIATE AND ALSO. TO BE THE

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:50.862
BACKSTOPS BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:53.064
WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SARAH CASKEY

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:54.432
WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THE

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:56.534
WAY NOW THIS IS NEGLIGENCE

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.436
STANDARD HAS BEEN SHIFTED. THE

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.538
BACKSTOP OF THAT LIABILITY ENDS

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:03.307
UP BEING ON. ON EITHER LOCAL OR

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:04.075
STATE GOVERNMENT OR FEDERAL

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:05.710
GOVERNMENT BUT THERE'S A SORT

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:08.012
OF PUBLIC BACKSTOPS NOW AND I'M

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.381

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.918
AGENCIES IN OUR FRAMEWORK AND

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:16.187
THAT MAY REQUIRE AUGMENTATIONS

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.389
OF FUNDING TO BOLSTER THAT

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.590
BACKSTOP BUT I THINK THAT'S A

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.793
WORTHY PUBLIC INVESTMENT. AND I

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:24.228

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:25.363
JURISDICTIONAL YES WITH A

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.398
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD BUT THAT

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:29.734
STANDARD ITSELF WILL DICTATE-
