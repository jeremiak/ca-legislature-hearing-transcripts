00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:56.187 region:rollup2
PREMISE.

00:45:53.618 --> 00:45:57.989 region:rollup2
THAT G.. IMPACTS ARE THE MOST

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:59.724 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE CAT TO

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:01.192 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND

THAT WERE BOTH PART OF A

00:46:10.034 --> 00:46:12.703 region:rollup2
REGIONAL STRATEGY TO REDUCE

FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY.

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:22.446 region:rollup2
AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE DOES NOT

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:24.015 region:rollup2

ALTERNATIVES

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:39.930 region:rollup2
WHAT AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE DOES

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:41.465 region:rollup2
IS REQUIRED PROJECTS ARE FIXED

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.868 region:rollup2
NOT SIMPLY STOPPED WHEN A

HERE.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.462 region:rollup2
ONE IS THAT THE SCIENCE DOESN'T

AMONG SCIENTISTS.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:51.066 region:rollup2
THERE'S OLD OVERWHELMING

01:22:49.231 --> 01:22:52.801 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS THAT THE DENSITY OF

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:20.896 region:rollup2
SECOND A MASS TIMBER IS A

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:22.464 region:rollup2
COMBUSTIBLE FIRE RISK.

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:23.732 region:rollup2
MASTABA BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:25.501 region:rollup2
IMPLIED.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:27.803 region:rollup2
IN MUCH LITERATURE AND

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:29.238 region:rollup2
ADVERTISING IT BEHAVES LIKE FIRE

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:31.840 region:rollup2
RESISTIVE MATERIAL.

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:34.209 region:rollup2
A INTO FIVE DOING FIRED DUE TO

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.811 region:rollup2
ITS HIRING LAYER. BUT A UNLIKE

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:37.946 region:rollup2
FIRE RESISTIVE MATERIALS THE

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:40.682 region:rollup2
COMBUSTIBLE TIMBER ACTUALLY

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:41.783 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIRE LOW

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.086 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING THE FLASH OVER.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:46.355 region:rollup2
SO MASTABA STRUCTURES ARE

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:47.856 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE THE FIERY

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.424 region:rollup2
EVENT.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:51.293 region:rollup2
M. WILL HAVE TO BE DEMOLISHED

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:53.128 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FIRE.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:54.930 region:rollup2
BUT THE THIRD POINT IS.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:56.832 region:rollup2
MASS TIMBER IS A JOB CREATORS

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:58.333 region:rollup2
DOT PROVEN.

01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:58.834 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT NEW

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:04.506 region:rollup2
MASS TIMBER PRODUCTS NEW

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:06.408 region:rollup2

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:08.510 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES.

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:10.178 region:rollup2
A IN WOOD MANUFACTURING HAVE

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:12.381 region:rollup2
DISPLACED JOBS.

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:13.916 region:rollup2
INTO WOULDN'T SEE NOT THE LACK

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.216 region:rollup2
OF COMMAND.

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:16.451 region:rollup2
OF FINALLY.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:18.086 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING. INNOVATION IS

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:20.422 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ADMIRABLE OF BUT THE

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:21.890 region:rollup2
BILL IS A ZERO SUM GAME

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:24.226 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:26.595 region:rollup2
IT SEEKS TO PROTECT JOBS IN ONE

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:28.497 region:rollup2
SECTOR WHILE AT THE EXPENSE OF

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.465 region:rollup2
OTHERS WORKING IN DIFFERENT

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:31.900 region:rollup2
SECTORS WITHIN CALIFORNIA.

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:34.069 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ARTIFICIAL BENEFIT TO

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:35.470 region:rollup2
ONE MATERIAL CAN ONLY BE JUST A

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.039 region:rollup2
VALUE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.874 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:40.375 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE LEGISLATION THAT

01:24:38.874 --> 01:24:42.311 region:rollup2
USE TAX DOLLARS.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:43.679 region:rollup2
TO DECIDE WINNERS OR LOSERS IN

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.347 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:45.814 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ARM.

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:51.019 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:51.987 region:rollup2

AND. IT REALLY AND MY COURAGE BY

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.701 region:rollup2
THAT DIALOGUE.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.470 region:rollup2
WHEN THING WE APPLY IT IS THE

01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:10.238 region:rollup2
INTENT OF THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
THAT ADDRESSING A WILDFIRE

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:14.209 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:15.744 region:rollup2
AS RURAL JOB CREATION.

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.178 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR INDUSTRY WE

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:18.213 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF RURAL.

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:19.348 region:rollup2
.

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:22.951 region:rollup2
PLANTS AND FEEL THAT'S OF

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:24.086 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PLACE TO FOCUS.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.220 region:rollup2
WE ALSO AS TEN MENTIONED ARE OUR

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:26.588 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS OF NON COMBUSTIBLE

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.923 region:rollup2
BUILDING MATERIALS.

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.591 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK IS IMPORTANT PART

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:31.226 region:rollup2
OF THE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD.

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:33.362 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY WE OPPOSE THIS

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:35.330 region:rollup2
BILL UNLESS AMENDED.

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:36.231 region:rollup2
IS THAT LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.065 region:rollup2
WE FEEL IT'S NOT THE PLACE OF

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.800 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO PICK

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:39.501 region:rollup2
FAVORITES.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.336 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:42.137 region:rollup2
MATERIALS.

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:43.071 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.940 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE CODES

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:45.741 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.709 region:rollup2

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:51.113 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY WE DO HAVE SOME

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:53.582 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS

01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:54.750 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN TERMS OF USING MASS

01:25:57.386 --> 01:26:00.856 region:rollup2
FOR SOLUTIONS USING THAT WOULD.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.557 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:03.592 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED BY SOME OF THE

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:05.560 region:rollup2

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:06.328 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED TO CAL FIRE. AND WE

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.463 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT.

RIGHT TYPE OF SOLUTION MOVING

STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT

01:45:24.585 --> 01:45:26.954 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE.

01:45:26.387 --> 01:45:29.056 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO

01:45:26.954 --> 01:45:30.824 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:32.593 region:rollup2
SEQUEL BY ITS VERY NATURE IS A

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:34.862 region:rollup2
BILL OR EXCUSE ME THE STATUTE

01:45:32.593 --> 01:45:36.764 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO ADDRESS TANGIBLE AND

VERIFIABLE. ENVIRONMENTAL

01:45:36.764 --> 01:45:40.834 region:rollup2
IMPACTS FROM PROPOSED PROJECTS

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:43.170 region:rollup2
THIS BILL RADICALLY EXPAND SEEK

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:45.706 region:rollup2
WERE TO ADDRESS IMPACTS THAT ARE

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:47.241 region:rollup2
NOT QUANTIFIABLE. BE REALLY FOR

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:49.276 region:rollup2
SLEEP AGENCIES TO

01:45:47.241 --> 01:45:51.278 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE INTENT.

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:51.946 region:rollup2
AND IT BE A FACT AT A STAGE IN

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:55.249 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:45:51.946 --> 01:45:57.985 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:45:55.249 --> 01:45:59.987 region:rollup2
SEE WERE. A. IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:45:57.985 --> 01:46:02.056 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ALLOW FOR THE AGENCIES

01:45:59.987 --> 01:46:03.791 region:rollup2

OR DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT.

01:46:08.896 --> 01:46:21.208 region:rollup2
AND WILL LEAD TO EXCESSIVE

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:21.909 region:rollup2
STEEPLE LITIGATION.

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.476 region:rollup2
WE ALSO OFFICIALLY OPPOSE AB TWO

01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:23.143 region:rollup2

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:29.550 region:rollup2

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.422 region:rollup2
ALLOWING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:51:00.754 --> 01:51:03.824 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:04.725 region:rollup2

01:51:03.824 --> 01:51:05.826 region:rollup2
MILLION TO STAY IN THE AFTER

01:51:04.725 --> 01:51:08.028 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE. FEAR

01:51:05.826 --> 01:51:10.164 region:rollup2
STANDARD STATEMENT THAT I ASKED

01:51:08.028 --> 01:51:11.698 region:rollup2
I'D I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND

01:51:10.164 --> 01:51:14.201 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION.

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:16.637 region:rollup2
OKAY IT'S OKAY WE CAN DISCUSS

01:51:14.201 --> 01:51:17.838 region:rollup2
PERHAPS FURTHER ADAM OFFLINE.

01:51:16.637 --> 01:51:20.140 region:rollup2
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH

01:51:17.838 --> 01:51:22.142 region:rollup2
IS IT SAYS YOU.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:23.343 region:rollup2

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:25.078 region:rollup2
ONE MAKE SURE THE PROJECT WILL

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:26.713 region:rollup2
NOT INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:28.448 region:rollup2

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:32.619 region:rollup2
EFFECT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

01:51:31.185 --> 01:51:34.221 region:rollup2
WELL AND AND IF YOU'D LIKE IT'S

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:35.756 region:rollup2
SIMPLY REFERENCING EXISTING LAW

01:51:34.221 --> 01:51:36.223 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT CREATING YOU LIE

01:51:35.756 --> 01:51:38.525 region:rollup2

01:51:36.223 --> 01:51:40.827 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS MUST COMPLY WITH

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:42.162 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION I'M FOR POTENTIAL

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:50.370 region:rollup2

YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BILL I WANT

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:07.221 region:rollup2

COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MS

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:11.959 region:rollup2
EGGMAN.

01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:13.226 region:rollup2
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:52:11.959 --> 01:52:16.063 region:rollup2
YOU'RE INTENDING TO AMEND THE

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:17.965 region:rollup2
BILL TO EXCLUDE HOUSING. OF FROM

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:19.533 region:rollup2
ITS PROVISIONS AND I APPRECIATE

01:52:17.965 --> 01:52:22.402 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT'S A A STEP

01:52:19.533 --> 01:52:23.103 region:rollup2
FORWARD. ORDINARILY WOULD NOT BE

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:26.106 region:rollup2
MY AND.

THE SCOPE OF. A SECRET

PROVISIONS AT A TIME WHEN.

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:35.048 region:rollup2
I THINK BECAUSE WE ALL SEE SOME

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:36.683 region:rollup2
ISSUES SAID THAT NEED TO BE

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:37.851 region:rollup2
RESOLVED WITH WITH SEQUINS ARE

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:40.554 region:rollup2
MANY OF US TO.

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:42.489 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN THIS CASE.

01:52:40.554 --> 01:52:44.391 region:rollup2
BOB I THINK YOUR INTENTION IF I

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:45.659 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT PROPERLY IS SET TO

01:52:44.391 --> 01:52:48.695 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THE DISADVANTAGED

01:52:45.659 --> 01:52:50.631 region:rollup2

SEQUEL WHICH A A AND THE

01:52:50.631 --> 01:52:55.636 region:rollup2

SURROUNDING PROJECTS.

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:06.580 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THE NATURE OF THE

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:07.347 region:rollup2
PROJECT MAKES THAT TO MAKE THAT

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:09.449 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT SO I THINK THAT.

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:11.051 region:rollup2

.

01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:03.730 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS A IT'S

01:55:02.596 --> 01:55:05.966 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:07.901 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME THAT SEQUEL IS

01:55:05.966 --> 01:55:08.969 region:rollup2
BEING EXTENDED TO SPECIFICALLY

01:55:07.901 --> 01:55:11.705 region:rollup2

01:55:16.977 --> 01:55:19.513 region:rollup2
.

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:23.049 region:rollup2
A WHOLE NEW.

01:55:19.513 --> 01:55:25.018 region:rollup2

I CAN CERTAINLY.

01:55:28.555 --> 01:55:33.126 region:rollup2
SEE HOW IT MAY BE.

01:55:30.557 --> 01:55:35.061 region:rollup2
EASIER TO PROVE INTENTIONAL

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.295 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION OR OR OR OR TO BE

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:36.229 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:38.732 region:rollup2
.

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:40.600 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY.

01:55:38.732 --> 01:55:42.669 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES ARE EVIDENCE OF

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.371 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION.

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:46.473 region:rollup2
I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:48.341 region:rollup2
THE DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT.

01:55:46.473 --> 01:55:49.743 region:rollup2
THEY THERE THERE IS SOME.

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:51.912 region:rollup2
POINT SOME DISCUSSION.

01:55:49.743 --> 01:55:53.647 region:rollup2
.

01:55:51.912 --> 01:55:56.383 region:rollup2
THAT I READ ABOUT HOW

01:55:53.647 --> 01:55:57.551 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT.

01:55:56.383 --> 01:56:00.387 region:rollup2
IT WAS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

01:55:57.551 --> 01:56:02.155 region:rollup2
MADE HOW HOW CAN YOU FORESEE.

01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:04.191 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:04.491 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OF IN A FOR.

01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:06.459 region:rollup2
IF IF OF OF.

01:56:04.491 --> 01:56:08.028 region:rollup2
.

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:08.328 region:rollup2
OF A RETAILER.

01:56:08.028 --> 01:56:10.163 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:12.165 region:rollup2
MOVED INTO THE.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:14.701 region:rollup2
THAT THE LOCATION AND AND

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:16.670 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE.

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:17.571 region:rollup2
FAIR AND NON DISCRIMINATORY ON

01:56:16.670 --> 01:56:19.472 region:rollup2
ITS FACE BUT THEN SUBSEQUENTLY

01:56:17.571 --> 01:56:21.007 region:rollup2
THE.

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.541 region:rollup2
THE THE OCCUPANT OR THE LOW OR

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:24.878 region:rollup2

.

01:56:24.878 --> 01:56:27.514 region:rollup2
THE THE THE OWNER OF THE

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:30.550 region:rollup2

DISCRIMINATE THERE. IS IS THAT

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:38.091 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL TO.

TRY TO ADDRESS. THOSE TYPE OF

WOULD THAT WOULD THAT FALL UNDER

01:56:39.226 --> 01:56:43.563 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT.

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:45.332 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:47.801 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT WANT INTENTIONAL

01:56:45.332 --> 01:56:49.469 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION TO BE PRACTICED.

01:56:47.801 --> 01:56:52.105 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO HEAR THE OPPOSITION

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:54.975 region:rollup2
AND. THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:56.910 region:rollup2
THIS AND OF THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:56:54.975 --> 01:56:58.278 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEING PLACED ON THOSE

01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:00.347 region:rollup2
WHO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO
