EIGHTY THREE WOULD XCEED TEN

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:06.911
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:09.547
YEAR. AND NINE MILLION ANNUALLY

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.382
ONGOING. THAT IS WHY WE BELIEVE

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:14.385
IT'S NEEDED NOW. OKAY AND I

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.053
DON'T. I DON'T A BELIEVER THE

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.888
POINT BUT IF YOU BELIEVED IT

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.557
WAS NEEDED ON FRIDAY WHY DIDN'T

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:21.258

WEEK HAVE THE AND IT. IS MY

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.528
QUICKNESS RHETORICAL YOU DON'T

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:25.096
NEED TO ANSWER BUT THE BUT I

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:27.364
MEAN YOU SEE THE POINT HI THIS

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:28.365
IS A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:30.534
CAUSED. SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:31.936
FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:33.270
IN THE STATE AND I THINK IT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.906
DESERVES A FAIR HEARING AND A

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:38.109
BALANCED- LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.577
DETERMINE THAT THE NEEDS OF

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:41.378
EVERYONE ARE BEING MET HERE AND

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:43.781
WE'RE NOT GIVING IT THAT EFFORT

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:44.281
AND THAT THAT'S- REALLY

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:51.088
DISAPPOINTING. FOR ALL UP I

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:52.223
APOLOGIZE FOR BELIEVING THE

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.524
POINT BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO ASK

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.593
WHY IS THERE A DISTINCTION BE

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:59.396
MADE BETWEEN H. TWO A.

00:39:59.463 --> 00:39:59.964
INDIVIDUALS AND KNOWLEDGE TO

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.098
INDIVIDUALS. WHAT'S THE

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:06.036
RATIONALE. THE H. TWO A.

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:06.637
PROGRAM IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:09.807
PROGRAM OF FEDERALLY FEDERAL

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:11.709
PROGRAM NOT STATE PROGRAM.

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.778
RIGHT BUT WHY WHY ARE YOU

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.246
SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:20.684
ELIGIBLE AND EVERYONE ELSE IS.

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.086
THEIR BACKGROUND THERE IS M.

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.387
AND MY MISSING SOMETHING WHERE

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:24.722
IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S A

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:25.923
FEDERAL PROGRAM. THEY'RE JUST

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.958
THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE AND THAT'S

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.627
THE REASON WHY OR I MEAN IT HAS

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:33.164
TO BE SOME OTHER. DEVICE I

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.731
THINK I CAN ASK A CLARIFYING

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:41.071
QUESTION JUST TO FINANCE. DO.

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:44.375
OKAY LET ME JUST. SO DO DO H.

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.310
TWO A. EMPLOYERS HAVE TO.

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:47.878
PROVIDE HOUSING AS A CONDITION

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:52.683
OF THE VISA. YES SIR SO

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.987
THEREFORE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.489
TO BRING IN THIS LABOR FROM A

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:00.858
FOREIGN COUNTRY PART OF THE

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:05.129
AGREEMENT IS THEY CAN. BRING IN

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.797
FOREIGN LABOR BUT THEY HAVE TO

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:10.467
PROVIDE. THE EMPLOYEES HOUSING

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:13.437
IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.972
CORRECT AND SO IS IT FAIR TO

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.640
SAY THAT THE STATE DOESN'T FEEL

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.410
LIKE THEY HAVE ANY OBLIGATION

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.779
TO SUBSIDIZE THAT HOUSING. IS

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.013
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SINCE I WAS UP

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:33.023
THE POLICY. I'M SORRY MR TANG

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.725
AT MEMBER TEAM I'M GOING TO

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:36.126
HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I. MOST

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:39.697
OF. I THINK THAT IS RELATIVELY

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.699
HELPFUL I JUST AND I GUESS

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.300
THAT'S SOME TURN UNDERSTAND THE-

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:45.502
WITH THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.338
POLICY DECISIONS ESPECIALLY AS

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.106
IT'S SO LATE IN THE IN THE

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.708
PROCESS AND THIS IS BEING

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:51.976
THRUST UPON US IT'S REALLY

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.744
IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.446
THE BACKGROUND OF WHY THESE

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:56.814
THINGS ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:59.984
YOU'RE FORCING US TO DECIDE IN.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.551
LESS THAN FORTY FORTY EIGHT

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:03.487
HOURS. THE DEPRECIABLE MY

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:04.922
COLLEAGUES FEEDBACK I WOULD

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:07.424
SAY. THAT AGAIN US DEPARTMENT

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:10.194
OF FINANCE REITERATED- THIS WAS

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:12.930
CLEAN UP THAT HOME WAS PROMISED

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.698
WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS IS

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:16.567
BILL THE SIGNED- I KNOW THAT

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:17.902
THERE WAS A TRAILER BILL THAT

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.203
WAS RELEASED EARLY IN THE YEAR

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.739
US DEPARTMENT FINANCE STATED- I

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.173
THINK THAT THE- LATENESS OF

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.209
THIS WAS BECAUSE- IT TOOK UNTIL

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.478
NOW TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. AND

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.546
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:31.081
RATIONALE AND ANYBODY CAN

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:32.983
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. IS

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.186
THAT AGAIN- THE EMPLOYERS GOT A

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.055
BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY GET TO USE

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:40.691
A VISA PROGRAM TO BRING IN

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:43.460
LABOR. PART OF THAT. THEY HAVE

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:45.729
TO PROVIDE HOUSING. THAT'S THAT

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.998
IS THE AGREEMENT TO BE ABLE TO

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:50.834
UTILIZE THE VISA PROGRAM.

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.236
THEREFORE THE STATE AT THIS

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.570
POINT DOESN'T FEEL ANY

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:57.341
OBLIGATION TO. SUBSIDIZE THAT

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.077
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OR PROGRAM

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.412
BECAUSE THE BENEFIT THAT THE

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:03.981
EMPLOYER COTTON WAS THE VISA.

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:06.717
SO AGAIN THAT IS MY- THAT'S MY

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.652
UNDERSTANDING AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:12.923
BEEN. IN DISCUSSIONS FOR- THE

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.258
BETTER PART OF THIS BUDGET YEAR

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:16.060
AYE I WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:18.562
ISSUE. VERY EARLY ON IN THE

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:21.265
BUDGET PROCESS IS TO- THE BACK

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.700
AND FORTH NEGOTIATIONS IT IS IT

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:26.570
IS- I WISH THAT THE RESOLUTION

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:28.806
HAVE COME SOONER. BUT I KNOW

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:30.274
THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.809
DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:32.409
THEY HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.211
QUITE AWHILE. I GUESS ONE OF MY

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.913
CONCERNS IS THE- THE COLOR

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.780
NINETEEN IS KIND OF WILD CARD

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:37.881
BECAUSE IF SOMEONE DOES

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.316
CONTRACT OVER NINETEEN.

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:40.617
OBVIOUSLY AND THEY'VE GOT

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.119
FAMILY BETTER MOVE AWAY. BUT

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.153
THEY AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.923
HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST SO. TO

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.925
ME THAT THAT CONNECTS FACTOR

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:52.029
THAT WASN'T PLANNED SO. IT JUST

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.163
WOULD BE. I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.565
OWN AROUND THE REASONING IS

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:57.234
DENYING THEM THAT. IF THEY ARE

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:58.502
IF THEY TEST POSITIVE FOR

ONE OF THE BILLS THAT I AM VERY

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.489
DISAPPOINTED WAS RAISED SO LATE

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:34.157
IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:36.059
HAVE BEEN DEBATING CORONA VIRUS

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.761
RELATED RELIEF LEGISLATION FOR

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:38.862
THE LAST THREE MONTHS IN THIS

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.363
BODY TO ME IT IS COMPLETELY

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.032
UNCONSCIONABLE THAT THIS

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.834
LANGUAGE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.503
INTO A BILL ON FRIDAY THE DAY

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.338
OF THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:48.872
MONDAY OF THE LAST DAY OF

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:52.042
SESSION. BOB THE SECOND BALL I

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.144
DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS POSSIBLY

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.111
A BUDGET BILL I MEAN WE'VE

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.413
WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.647
DOLLAR APPROPRIATION IN HERE

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.449
OTHER THAN THAT THE MEAT OF THE

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.750
BILL IS A VERY SUBSTANTIVE

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:02.419
POLICY ISSUE THAT I THINK IS

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.120
MORE TO PROPERLY DEBATED POLICY

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:06.289
COMMITTEE BUT I MEAN LASTLY LET

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:09.359
ME JUST POINT OUT THAT THE

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.794
EIGHTY COMMON ARGUMENT THAT

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.828
WE'VE BEEN HAVING HERE WE TALK

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:13.196
ABOUT PUTTING MORE RESTRICTIONS

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.298
ON THE STATE'S EMPLOYERS WITH

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:17.734
RESPECT TO CORONAVIRUS IS THIS

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:20.804
MISCONCEPTION THAT. IF WE FORCE

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:23.006
EMPLOYERS TO PAY MORE THEN

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.341
THAT'S JUST MEANS THAT THEY'LL

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:25.375
MAKE A LITTLE LESS PROFIT THIS

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:27.410
YEAR I MEAN LONG TERM IT'S A

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.845
ZERO SUM GAME SOMEBODY HAS TO

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.413
PAY THE PRICE FOR THAT OUR

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.448
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:32.782
ALREADY STRUGGLING THEY CAN'T

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.651
CONTINUE TO STAY IN BUSINESS IF

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.219
LONG TERM THEY DON'T MAKE MORE

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.321
THAN THEY SPEND SO THE LONG

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.856
TERM CONSEQUENCE OF EVERYTHING

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:41.992
THAT WE DO HERE IS TO RESIST

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:43.426
WHEN WE PUT A NEW RESTRICTION

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:45.262
ON- HAVING TO PAY BENEFITS FROM

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.763
AN EMPLOYER IN AN ATTEMPT TO

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.931
TRY AND MITIGATE THIS

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.733
CORONAVIRUS SITUATION IS LONG

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.501

TO RAISE PRICES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.604

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.613
AND COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WAS

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:45.248
SORT OF THE INTENT OR PURPOSE

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.250
BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL. AS FAR

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.452
AS- THE SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.152
PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN IN

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.520
DISCUSSION WITH COUNTIES FOR

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:52.688
MONTHS AOUT. WHETHER THEY

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:55.224
THINK THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY OR

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:55.825
ABILITY TO ROUGHLY. SOMETHING

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.493
AND TAKE ON THESE CHALLENGES

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.394
WITH AND GIVEN THAT TRACK

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.862
RECORD THEY DO FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:00.896
WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:02.665
FUNDING THAT THEY CAN DO THAT.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.233
SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE INCREASED

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.103
OUR AMOUNT PER YOU FROM

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.037
1-002-500-0200 TWENTY FIVE

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.639
THOUSAND. WE HAVE A START UP

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.474
GRANT OF NINE POINT SIX MILLION

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.375
THAT'S RELATED TO PROGRAM

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.976
DEVELOPMENT. AS IT RELATES

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.845
SPECIFICALLY TO SEX OFFENDER

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:18.481
TREATMENT. THAT THEIR- THERE'S

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.583
A SMALL NUMBER OF YOUTH THAT.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.285
ARE AT DJJ FOR THOSE TIMES.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.220
MAINTENANCE AND IT'S NOT REALLY

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.221
EXPECTATIONS AND OUR

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:27.056
CONVERSATIONS THAT EACH COUNTY

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.024
WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF A

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.825
SPECIALIZED PROGRAM LIKE THAT.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:30.893
THE START UP GRANTS WOULD

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.395
PROBABLY BE TARGETED AT A

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:34.030
COUPLE COUNTIES I FEEL LIKE TO

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:36.365
HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.267
DO THAT PROGRAM WELL. AND AN

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.735
ESTABLISHED SYSTEM STRUCTURES

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.070
AROUND THAT AND THEN WORK WITH

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.405
THEIR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES.

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.639
THROUGH THEIR STUFF.

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.041
RELATIONSHIPS TO PROVIDE THAT

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:48.311
TYPE OF CARE. SO THAT'S WHY WE

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.112
WORK HOW WE THINK THIS WILL

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.381
WORK LONG TERM- AS FAR AS WHY

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:55.318
NOW- THAT BOTH THE STATE AND

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.153
LOCAL SYSTEM NEED CERTAINTY ON

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.622
THIS ISSUE. AND THAT THIS IS AN

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.657
IMPORTANT REFORM. IT IS A SAD

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:06.996
THIS BUDGET. IS A LONG TERM

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:07.897
IMPLEMENTATION. JULY ONE WE ARE

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:08.831
NOT SHIFTING ALL EIGHT YOU THE

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:11.067
DJ. CAL IS IT'LL BE A SLOW

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.168
EMPLOYMENT. HAS CASES ARE

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.437
ADJUDICATED OVERTIME AND SO

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:15.204
WE'RE WE'RE THINKING IT'LL BE

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.073
AT LEAST OVER FOUR YEARS FOR

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.008
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:19.575
PROGRAM. AND WE EXPECT TO

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.744
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. AND

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.746
MODIFY PROPOSED ARE PROPOSED AS

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.481
WE LEARN NEW THINGS AND NEED TO

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.350
PAY FOR IT. SO I THINK IT'S

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.218
IMPORTANT START NOW GIVEN THAT

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:32.088
UNCERTAINTY ON BOTH ENDS AND-

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.423
IT DEFINITELY THERE'S TIME TO.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.392
ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.993
OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS MY

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.161
LAST QUESTION IS A BIG COUNTIES

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:40.363
MAY BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS AND

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:41.697
DEAL WITH IT. BUT A LOT OF

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.165
SMALL COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:45.267
THE RESOURCES THE MONEY TO DEAL

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.204
WITH THIS. SO THE ELOISE.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.271
ALAMEDA'S THE CENSUS OF THE BIG

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.574
COUNTIES CAN DO THAT. BUT FOR

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.109
THOSE KIDS THAT GO TO A SMALL

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.343
COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.879
RESOURCES. OR THE CAPACITY. TO

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.115
IMPROVE THESE KIDS LIVES. TO ME

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.249
THE MONEY'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.550
THERE HASN'T BEEN THERE THEY

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.085
DON'T HAVE AFFECTED PROGRAMS.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:04.153
AND YEAH YOU WANT TO SIT ON

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.721
HOLD BECAUSE THE FAMILIES. BUT

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.389
I CAN'T GET THE PROPER

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:08.023
TREATMENT. WE'RE SAYING THIS

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.425
THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM IS SET UP

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.893
FOR FAILURE FOR MOST THE COUNTY

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.631
WAS NOT LARGE. COUNTIES AND

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.732
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. SO IT

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:19.135
DOES THE RULE COUNTIES BEEN A

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:23.239
CONCERN OR REPORT OF A POINTOF. TIME OUR CONVERSATIONS AND

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.607
I THINK. THEY DO HAVE

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.409
ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.144
AMONGST EACH OTHER AND AS I

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.478
DESCRIBE I THINK IT'S WORKING

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.180
THOSE THINGS THOSE THINGS OUT

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.215
ABOUT. IF THEY HAVE A YOUTH

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:34.583
THAT COMMITS A SERIOUS SEX

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.252
OFFENCE THE NEEDS. AND ALL OF A

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.453
SPECIALIZED TREATMENT WHERE

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.754
WOULD THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.356
IN SOME KIND OF REGIONAL

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.758
FORMAT. AND SO- YOU KNOW WITH

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:43.793
TIME I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.294
WORK THAT OUT AND IT'S NOT THE

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.496
EXPECTATION. OF THE STATE I

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.565
THINK OR EVEN LOCALLY THAT THEY

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:50.533
WOULD THEY WOULD BUILD THEIR

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:54.203
PROGRAMS IN SUCH A WAY. THAT

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:54.703
THAT'S REALLY A WISHFUL

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.771
RESPONSE. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.907
SMALL COUNTIES WE GATHER SO IT

01:07:57.973 --> 01:07:59.108
CAN POOL RESOURCES BUT STILL

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.310
GOING TODAY. IT'S STILL A VERY.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:02.578
LIMITED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES A

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:04.747
SMALL COUNTIES HAVE SO. THEY

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:05.514
CAN PUT TOGETHER MAKE IT

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.316
EFFECTIVE. AND I WERE I REFER

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.151
COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS SO.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:11.220
IT'S TOUGH FOR THE SMALL

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:14.657
COUNTIES OUT THERE SO THANK YOU.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:17.426
THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:20.563
QUESTIONS START WORK. YES I

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.832
WANT TO- BASICALLY THANK THOSE

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.567
WHO BEEN WORKING TO TRY O COME

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.068
TO SOME CONCLUSION AND RESOLVE

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:29.238
THE ISSUE- WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.207
RELATIONSHIP. USE ME WITH THE

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.175
COUNTIES IN THE AND THE KIND OF

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.044
OVERSIGHT THAT'LL BE CENTRAL-

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.479
TO MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE PROGRAM

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.380
SO I'M WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.583
NEW LANGUAGE THAT'S COME OUT.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.685
WITH REGARDS TO THAT- WE HAVE

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:43.986
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PROBABLY

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.020
IF WE HAD A VERY VERY

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:48.057
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OF FOR DJJ

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:48.591
WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:50.426
TOUCHING IT AT THIS POINT- BUT

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.794
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.496
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF RECIDIVISM

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:57.166
MEDIC EXISTEN DJJ. AND SO THE

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.100
HIGH LEVEL OF STUDENTS

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.103
RETURNING- AND BASICALLY ALMOST

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.137
BUILDING A PIPELINE TO PRISON

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:04.340
IS UNACCEPTABLE OF THE

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.275
ADVOCATES WHO WORK DIRECTLY

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:07.910
WITH THESE KIDS WHO ARE A PART

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.678
OF A HOST OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.180
AS WELL AS- SOME OF THOSE WHO

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.648
ARE ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAMS

01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:14.383
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF US. BASICALLY

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.952
MAKING THE- THE MOVEMENT AWAY

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.754
FROM WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.022
BIT OF PUTTING IT BACK TO THE

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.991
COUNTIES AND IN A MUCH EASIER

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.526
WAY FOR KIDS TO HAVE ACCESS.

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:24.994
ONLY AND FOR THE FAMILIES ALSO

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.595
HAVE SIMILAR ACCESS TO PROGRAMS

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.464
THAT RELATE TO THE KIDS- WE

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.598
KNOW THERE ARE SMALL COUNTIES

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.434
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.736
WHY WE SAID ALSO THAT. YOU KNOW

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:35.638
THAT ARE OF A PERSON'S ZIP CODE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:36.272
SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.007
SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE THAT

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.041
THEY RECEIVE FROM AND FROM

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:41.143
THERE- FROM THE COUNTIES AND SO

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.044
THE WORK WILL BE UPON THE

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.345
COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.780
ADVOCATES TO BASICALLY MAKE

01:09:44.847 --> 01:09:46.315
SURE. THAT EVERY CHILD HAS THE

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:48.017
RIGHT PLACEMENT WITH REGARDS TO

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:50.252
WHAT SERVICES THEY MAY NEED BUT

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:50.886
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.087
WE DO NOT HAVE QUOTE UNQUOTE A

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.923
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AS SUCH IT

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.391
MAY BE SUCCESSFUL TO SOME. BUT

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:56.592
WHEN YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:57.960
RECIDIVISM IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.895
PROGRAMS WE CAN'T TOLERATE THAT

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:00.963
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.798
WHERE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.366
THAT- WE ARE NOT JUST SIMPLY

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.901
FEEDING THE NEXT LEVEL OF

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.137
INCARCERATION- THAT WE

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.205
SOMETIMES SEE SO- I KNOW IT'S

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.240
BEEN A JOURNEY FOR EVERYBODY

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.408
WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON A VERY

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:13.742
APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE EFFORTS

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:14.443
THAT HAVE GONE INTO THIS

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.844
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN AN EASY

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:16.979
ONE. AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.481
QUICK FALL DISCUSSION BECAUSE

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.183
OF THE FACT IT'S TAKEN US TO A

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.251
TWO YEARS OR MORE TO GET TO

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.886
THIS POINT WHERE WE ARE WITH

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.087
REGARDS TO THE TRANSFER THAT'S

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.056
THE IT- THE WORD CAME OUT

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:31.627
INITIALLY AND EVERYBODY WAS.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:32.194
ALL EXCITED BUT REALIZE THAT

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:32.795
THERE WAS A LOT OF. DETAILS I

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:33.395
NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.063
STILL. MORE TO BE WORK OUT WITH

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.331
REGARDS TO MAKING SURE. THAT

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.399
THE DECISIONS WE MAKE WITH THE

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:38.000
GARDEN YOUNG PEOPLE IS A GOOD

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.335
DECISION SO. YOU KNOW ALL THE

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:40.569
RESEARCH AND INFORMATION SHOWS

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:41.904
THAT THIS IS THAT THIS WE'RE

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.472
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.040
AND BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:45.941
TO MOVE IT IT DOESN'T MOVE

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.443

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.790
FINANCE OR ALEJO- MY

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.892
UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THE

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.461
CURRENT POPULATION OF THE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.830
JUDGES JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:08.330
OF EIGHT HUNDRED IS THAT

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.833
CORRECT. THAT IT THAT IS

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:14.069
CORRECT IN MY MIND OR STANDING

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:18.807
WAS THAT. THE YOUTH WHO ARE IN

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:19.842
THE CURRENT POPULATION AREN'T

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:22.878
BEING MOVED THE BILL REALLY IS

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.814
IMPACTING THE POPULATION AS

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.920
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY INITIALLY

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:32.955
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.523
LONGER TERM COMMERCE

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:37.559
CONVERSATION OF DJJ GETS REALLY

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.162
SMALL BUT THAT'S MANY YEARS OUT.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.697
GOT SPENT THE DAY BASICALLY

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.632
WHAT WE'RE REALLY DISCUSSING IS

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:48.837
AS WE DO DJJ INTAKE OF THE-

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:49.438

HASN'T REALLY BEEN ABOUT.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:05.854
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM IS

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.357
WORKING OR NOT HASN'T REALLY

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:08.791
BEEN ABOUT MONEY AND

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:15.397
ACCOUNTABILITY. HI YEAH I MEAN

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.198
I THINK IT'S THEIR CONCERN TO

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.967
MAKE THE PROGRAM- OPERATE IN A

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.669
IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR THEM

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:23.806

BEEN OF THAT- AND AT LAKE AND

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.945
SORT OF LIKE HOW ON HOW WE CAN

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.580

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:32.681
THEIR PROGRAMS HAS BEEN A

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.316
CONCERN YEAH. RIGHT BUT IT BUT

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.452
AREN'T AREN'T THE REASON THEY

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:37.553
COUNTIES ARE SUCH FINANCIAL.

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:40.089
STREETS REGARDING- PUBLIC

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.290
FIFTIES BECAUSE THEY MADE VERY

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:45.694
POOR DECISIONS. BUILT EVEN ALL

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.097
FACILITIES THAT ARE NEARLY

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:50.833

CURRENT FACILITIES ARE FILLED

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.813
AT A VERY LOW RATE COMPARED TO

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.583
THEIR OWN CAPACITY YES AND NO

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.885

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.730
WHAT'S VERY CONCERNING. IN

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:22.765
TERMS OF FEEDBACK FROM THE

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.399
COUNTIES NO NOBODY TALKED

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:28.370

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:28.937
HUNDRED KIDS I DIDN'T HEAR

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:31.140
ANYTHING ABOUT. WHETHER THIS

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.142

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.843
FOR THE KIDS HE WAS GONNA IN

THE MONEY AND WE DON'T WANT ANY

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.518
OVERSIGHT. SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.319
FROM THE COUNTY POINT OF VIEW.

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:46.488
THAT THEY WANT TO STAND BEHIND

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.123
A FAILED PROGRAM DR WEBER

THESE EMPTY JAILS LOOKING FOR

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.681
THE STATE THE BILL ABOUT. AND I

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.783
THINK THE STATE IS TIRED OF

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.286
THIS FAILURE ON THE COUNTY'S

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:20.222
PART. SO WE HAVE COME UP WITH

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.058
THE SYSTEM. THAT WE THINK IS

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:27.696
ARE BETTER GOING TO WORK. AND

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:31.433
ON TOP OF IT YES- MICHAEL IF NO

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.000
GROUP IS CORRECT WE'RE GONNA

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.603
HAVE. A LITTLE BIT OVERSIGHT

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.471
AND I KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:37.739
THIS TOOTH AND NAIL BECAUSE

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:40.709
THEY ACTUALLY WANT THE THREE

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.878
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.713
YOUTH THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.447
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WHAT

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:46.081
THEY'RE GETTING I'M GETTING MY

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.783
HEAD SHAKE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.918
COUNTIES UNDER SO I'M JUST

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:50.485
PUTTING UP WITH THE COUNTIES

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.154
WANT. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:58.293
DOLLARS. PER USE. THREE HUNDRED

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.661
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUTH WE

THEM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.667
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:08.337
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.239
SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE ENOUGH

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.440
IS ENOUGH BECAUSE IF WE CAN

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.542

DIFFERENT KIND OF PROGRAM. AND

01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:22.718
SO FOR ME. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.286
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.054
SUCCESSFUL WE CAN DO BETTER

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:29.958
THAN THE 25% SIX US RATE THAT

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.227
IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. WE CAN

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.896
DO BETTER THAN TO HAVE THESE

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.664
EMPTY JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:36.965
ACROSS THE COUNTY TO BLEED

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.035
MONEY. AND BOY IF THE COUNTIES

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:42.571

THESE. EIGHT HUNDRED OR SO

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:49.444

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:59.588
LEADERSHIP IN THE COUNTIES.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.056

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:03.792
REASONS THE JUVENILE HALLS ARE

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.527

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.095
IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE TALK

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:12.601
YOU GET OUT THE SAME DAY SO YOU

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.002
COULD ASK GROUP SOMEONE YOU GO

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.671

SPORTS PROGRAMS FOR KIDS SO

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.043
THERE'S A PRISON SCHOOL

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.611
PIPELINE BUT IT INVOLVES A

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.513
WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THIS. BUT

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.682
WHAT I'M SAYING IS. AB ONE OH

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:03.719
NINE REALIGNMENT FAIL. THIS IS

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.687
A MINI VERSION OF THAT. AND

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.255
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT BETTER

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:08.023
AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.924
THE THINGS TO FIX THEIR

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:11.026
PRIMARILY KIDS OF COLOR. SO

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:11.927
UNTIL SOMEONE GOES MOST

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.530
NEIGHBORHOODS IT HAS THE GUTS

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:17.432
TO FIX WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT.

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.768
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE. BECAUSE

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.737
THE SAME THINGS BEEN GOING ON

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:22.304
THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS AND

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.605

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.375
REDEVELOPMENT US WE TAKE CARE

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:27.476

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.745
OF OUR KIDS HELLO WE HAVE A

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.413
TAKING CARE OF THEM FOR YEARS

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.249
THAT HS NOT CHANGED SO THIS IS

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:36.785
pJUST LIKE AB ONE OH NINE WAS

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:39.621
ABSOLUTELY 1% BELIEVE IN IT. I

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.756
THOUGHT I THOUGHT IMPLEMENTED.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.124
AND ADMINISTRATION STILL CAN'T

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.759
TELL ME IN FINANCE. WHAT WAS

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.160
THAT OF THE RATE IS FOR THE

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:45.994
COUNTY JAILS BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.829
NO IDEA. THAT'S ATROCIOUS IT'S

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.232
ACCEPTABLE TO THE STAFF THAT'S

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:54.002
A SINGLE TEST. FOR I MEAN I

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.737
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:58.006
COLLEAGUE FROM. HELP GROWTH

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.075
THAT THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.943
BROKEN. THERE'S NO QUESTION.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.913
AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.415
WE CAN ACCEPT THAT THE SYSTEM

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:10.652
IS BROKEN. AND JUST. KEEP GOING.

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:13.622
OR WE CAN TRY TO CHANGE. AND I

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:16.825
THINK THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:19.461
TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE FAILURE

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.929
THAT IT THE SYSTEM IS WHICH I

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.964
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:23.565
COLLEAGUE FROM THE GROUP THAT

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.233
THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED. AND THIS

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.903
IS A APPROACH TO TRY TO CHANGE

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:31.239
THAT. AND WHAT IS THE APPROACH

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.442
WITH THE APPROACH IS TO ENSURE

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:39.247

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.730
A FAILURE NOT JUST FROM THE U.

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:57.566

BILLS THAT FALLS INTO THE

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.354
CATEGORY OF SOMETHING THAT HAS

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.022
BEEN DISCUSSED. FOR YEARS HERE

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.690
IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:23.725

THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR THE

PUBIC TO WEIGH IN ON IT- IT'S

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:39.874
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO COST

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.176
THE STATE POTENTIALLY A LOT OF

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.510
MONEY. AND I THINK THAT WE OWE

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.179
OUR PUBLIC THE TRANSPARENCY TO

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.780

ACTUALLY TO HAVE A HARD TIME

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.329
RIGHT NOW THINKING OF WHAT-

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:45.033

TAXPAYER TO VERIFY THAT THE

THAT THEY REALLY DOWNTURN THAT

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.923

BUDGET RELATED I THINK IS

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:28.556
RIDICULOUS. BUT I MEAN

TRANSPARENCY IT'S SOMETHING

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:08.329
THAT NEEDS PUBLIC DEBATE. IT'S

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.230
