A HUMAN TRAFFICKING MANY OTHER ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATION BUT LOOK FOR TO THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE CHAIR LOW AND- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT HOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC INTERFACE WITH GOVERNMENT.

AND SO IT IS AN IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH US. WITH OUR LICENSE PROGRAM AND THEN THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. I WANT TO SEE BEFORE WE INVITE UP OUR FIRST PANEL TO SEE ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE KEY ON THAT. ON THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING OTHERWISE WE WILL BEGIN. I THINK THAT'S THE HIGH SIGN TO BE AND SO. LET ME WELCOME. TO THE OUR JOINT COMMITTEE. MEMBERS LEADERSHIP OF THE BOARD OF BARBER IN COSMETOLOGY LEASES ON THE BOARD PRESIDENT COME ON UP DOCTOR KERRY WILLIAMS PRIOR BOARD PRESIDENT AT A CURRENT BOARD MEMBER.

HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WELCOME AND FOR HAVING US WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY. THOSE AT IN ORDER TO GET STARTED I'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE AN INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF. AS WELL AS- MY COLLEAGUE HERE WITH ME MY NAME IS LISA TONGUE IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD APARTMENT COSMETOLOGY. AND WITH ME TODAY'S THEIR IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT DR CARRIE WILLIAMS ON MY RIGHT. AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTIVE FIRST STANDARD. WE JUST WANNA THANK YOU AND THE STAFF OF BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEES. FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. AND TO TALK ABOUT OUR BOARD WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND CHARGED WITH THE MISSION. TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. BY PROMOTING ETHICAL STANDARDS AND BY ENFORCING. THE LAWS OF THE BAR BRING IN PP INDUSTRY. THE BOARD PLAYS AN IMPORTANT. ROLE IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS TO INDUSTRY. AND THAT IS THE PLANS. WE EVALUATE ALL MATTERS BEFORE THE BOARD INCLUDING LICENSING ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATION. WE VALUE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS A STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. SO BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE PORT ITSELF I WANTED TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD ITSELF. THE BOARD IS COMPRISED OF NINE. POINTED MEMBERS FIVE OF WHOM ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR MORE INDUSTRY MEMBERS WHO ARE LICENSEES THE BOARD SAID DR KERRY IS AN INDUSTRY MEMBER AND I AM A PUBLIC MEMBER. DR CARRIE IS A LICENSED BARBER AS WELL AS A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST AND SALON OWNER AS WELL AS A DOCTOR CHECK COLLEGE G. WHICH IS THE STUDY OF HAIR AND SCALP DISORDERS. SHE IS CONSIDERED BY THE INDUSTRY AS AN EXPERT AND SPECIALIST IN NATURAL HAIR STYLING AND HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR HER COMMUNITY IN THIS RESPECT. AND AS A NOTE NATURAL HAIR STYLING IT'S ACTUALLY NOT UNDER THE PURVIEW OF OUR BOARD. AS FOR MY OWN BACKGROUND I AM IN IN LANGUAGE MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONAL WHO HAS WORKED FOR THE PAST DECADE ON ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN COMMUNITY. INCLUDING ADVOCACY ISSUES OF REPRESENTATION AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. I'VE SERVED ON THE BOARD FOR THREE YEARS NOW AND IN THAT TIME OUR BOARD HAS GONE THROUGH MANY EFFORTS TO MOVE FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS DETAILS IN THE PORTS SENSE THAT REPORT WHICH WAS SUBMITTED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. JUST ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO. RIGHTS IN BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS IN THAT REPORT IN WHICH WE NOTED SEVERAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS. OUR BOARD HAS A VERY DIVERSE INDUSTRY AND AS SUCH WE HAVE MADE LANGUAGE ACCESS A PRIORITY. WE PROVIDE ALL OTHER PUBLICATIONS IN ENGLISH VIETNAMESE SPANISH AND KOREAN. AND WE HAVE RECENTLY TRANSLATED ALL HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS INTO ARABIC FARSI AND CHINESE WE ALSO PROVIDE REGULAR LANGUAGE ACCESS TRAINING TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THE BOARD HAS A DISCIPLINARY REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT HEARS APPEALS OF CITATIONS IN AN INFORMAL ENVIRONMENT. PRESIDED OVER BY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WE PROVIDE FREE OF CHARGE TRANSLATORS TO COLLINS. THIS COMMITTEES WORKLOAD HAS OFTEN CONSISTED OF AN EXTENSIVE BACKLOG REQUIRING LICENSEES TO WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS FOR HEARING. THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE. THIS COMMITTEE NOW OPERATES WITH NO BACKLOG AND HAS. HAS EVEN REDUCED THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT ARE HELD ANNUALLY AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT TREND. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THE WORK AND BETTER HEALTH AND SAFETY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THIS COMMITTEE THAT IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE HAS TOGETHER A DIVERSE GOUP OF INDIVIDUALS. STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. AB THE INDUSTRY ADVOCATES LICENSEES SCIENTISTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMMITTEE HAS DEVELOPED PERSONS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY COURSE TO INCLUDE. BASIC LABOR LAWS AND PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE AWARENESS. THE COMMITTEE IS NOW TAKING ON AN IN DEPTH REVIEW OF THE PORTS HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. I WILL BE MAKING A RECOMMENDATION TO THE FULL BOARD ON EXTENSIVE REFORM FOR THESE REGULATIONS TO ENSURE CONSUMER PROTECTION. WHICH ULTIMATELY IS ALSO A PROTECTION. OF OUR LICENSEES HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL. THE COMMITTEE ALSO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN DISCUSSIONS IT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WITHIN THE STREET THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE DYNAMICS DECISION HELPING SHED CLARIFIED CLARIFICATION. ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LARGE LICENSEE POPULATION THAT UTILIZE INDEPENDENT THAT UTILIZED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP. OUR BOARD ACTUALLY JUST VOTED A FEW WEEKS AGO AT OUR BOARD MEETING TO SUPPORT AB FIVE WITH AN AMENDMENT TO REMOVE ALL EXEMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR LICENSEES. AND REQUESTING MORE TIME TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND ISSUE SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSE POPULATION IN ORDER TO BEST DETERMINE HOW TO PROTECT TO LICENSEES FOR MISS CLASSIFICATION. BUT STILL ALLOW INDEPENDENCE AND INNOVATION FROM OUR LICENSEES TO WORK UNDER THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THE FEEL WORKS BEST FOR THEM SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON. LASTLY INNER SUNSET REVIEW REPORT WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HOPE WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN OUR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED STRENGTHENING THE BOARDS OVERSIGHT OVER SCHOOLS TO REDUCE THE SELLING OF OURS. CREATE A STANDALONE HAIRSTYLIST LICENSE AND CONSIDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERN PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN SCHOOL CAN WORK IN AN ESTABLISHMENT AND BE PAID WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO LEARN THE IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. TALK TO KAREN I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE GREATER CONTACTS FOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR ALL OF YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR INDUSTRY. THE REGULATION OF THE BDM BARBERING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER NINETY YEARS ORIGINALLY IT AS TWO SEPARATE BOARDS AND AS A COMBINED BOARD FOR THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. WE ISSUE INDIVIDUAL LICENSES TO COSMETOLOGIST BARBERS MANICURIST ELECTROLYSIS AND ASK THE TITIAN'S AND WE LICENSE ALL ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THOSE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. WE ALSO HAVE JOINT OVERSIGHT OF IMPROVE SCHOOLS WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY AS WELL AS JOINT OVERSIGHT OF APPRENTICE PROGRAMS. WITH THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS. SOME STATISTICS TO NOTE FOR THE BOARD WE HAVE OVER SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND LICENSEES. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WE RECEIVE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NEW APPLICATIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS. WE ADMINISTER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EXAMINATIONS AVAILABLE IN FOUR LANGUAGES INCLUDING SOME EXAMS IN PRESENTS TO BETTER FACILITATE RE ENTRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING INCARCERATION. WE ISSUE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND LICENSES. AND RECEIVE FORTY TWO HUNDRED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. WE ALSO CONDUCTED ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS AND ISSUE FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND CITATIONS. IN ORDER TO BECOME LICENSED AN INDIVIDUAL MUST MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PARTICULAR LICENSE TYPE. EACH APPLICANT MUST COMPLETE AN APPROVED COURSE IN EITHER AN APPROVED SCHOOL WHICH CAN BE PRIVATE OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR COMPLETE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THE BARBARIAN COSMETOLOGY COURSES ARE THE LENGTHIEST ACOSTA MYTHOLOGIST MUST COMPLETE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND A BARBER MUST COMPLETE FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. THE CURRICULUM FOR THESE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCLUDES TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICAL OPERATIONS IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS HANDS ON OPERATIONS OR ACTUAL SERVICES THAT MUST BE COMPLETED. ALL COURSES HAVE A VARIETY OF AREAS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE COVERED IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE THE COSMETOLOGY COURSE COVERS HAIRSTYLING PERMANENT WAVING AND CHEMICAL STRAIGHTENING. HAIR COLORING AND BLEACHING HAIR CUTTING HEALTH AND SAFETY DISINFECTION AND SANITATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY FACIALS INCLUDING CHEMICAL OFFICIALS EYEBROWS BEAUTIFICATION AND MAKE UP INCLUDING WAXING MANICURES AND PEDICURES. THIS IS ALL NDER THE COSMETOLOGY COURSE. A NOTABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BERMAN COSMETOLOGY IS AT THE BARBER COURSE FOCUSES IN AREA ON SHAVING AND TRIMMING THE BEARD WEARS COSMETOLOGY ENCOMPASSES NOT ONLY HAIR. BUT ALSO SCAN SERVICES AND NOW SERVICES. THE STUDENT WILL COMPLETE A COSMETOLOGY BARBERING COURSE IN APPROXIMATELY TEN MONTHS I'VE ENROLLED FULL TIME. THE BOARD CURRENTLY HAS TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE APPROVE SCHOOLS INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT OFFER THESE PROGRAMS THE BOARD APPROVES THE SCHOOLS BASED ON A REVIEW OF THEIR CURRICULUM EQUIPMENT AND SPACE AND TEXT BOOKS WELL THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY APPROVE SCHOOLS BASED ON A REVIEW A FULL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. WHICH INCLUDES MANY STOOGE PROTECTION ASPECTS THE COST OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM RANGES DRASTICALLY FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UP TO NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE TUITION COSTS OF CALIFORNIA PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND HAVE FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE IS APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PASS THE TITIAN ONLY TRILOGY MANY CURRENT COURSES ARE MUCH SHORTER. AND THEIR SCOPE IS MORE SPECIALIZED TO THE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT WILL BE PERFORMED. IMPORTANT NOTE HOWEVER IS THAT THE ONE AREA IN WHICH WE SEE BY FAR THE HIGHEST CONSUMER HARM COMPLAINTS IS THE ONE WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF REQUIRED SCHOOLING HOURS BEFORE LICENSURE. THE FOUR HUNDRED OUR MONITORING PROGRAM. ONCE AN APPLICANT COMPLETES THEIR COURSE THE APPLY TO TAKE THE LICENSING EXAMINATION. THE BOARD MAINTAINS TO EXAMINATION COMPREHENSIVE SITES THAT PROVIDE BOTH THE WRITTEN AND PRACTICAL PORTIONS OF THE EXAM. AND AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN COMPUTER BASED TESTING LCATIONS. WE ADMINISTRATOR SAM'S MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THE BOARD DOES UTILIZE THE NATIONAL EXAMINATION THAT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS THE PRACTICAL HANDS ON PORTION AS WELL AS THE COMPUTER BASED WRITTEN PORTION. SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES ARE PROVIDED A LICENSE IMMEDIATELY UPON PASSING THE EXAM. AND AT THIS POINT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DOCTOR KERRY WILLIAMS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OTHER ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS MENTIONED MY NAME IS DOCTOR KERRY WILLIAMS I AM THE PREVIOUS PAST PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD I AM A LICENSED BARBER A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST AND A DOCTOR OF PSYCHOLOGY. ANY CONSUMERS ARE NOT AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL HARM FROM VARIOUS SERVICES THAT ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THAT ARE LICENSED BY OUR BOARD. WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TYPES OF CONSUMER HARM WI FI. AND HOPE THAT IT MAY HELP FEES. COSMETOLOGY BARBERING. IN A REVIEW OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE CONSUMER HARM CASES PEDICURE INFECTION REMAINS A CONSTANT AT THE TOP CONSUMER HARM COMPLAINT. HOWEVER IT HAS DECREASED IN NUMBERS OVER THE PAST RECENT THREE YEARS. SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE OUTBREAK PEDICURE INFECTIONS THAT THE STATE INDOOR IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND. FOOT BASIN FOR NOT BEING CLEANED AND IF COST A BACTERIAL OUTBREAK LEADING MANY PEOPLE WITH PERMANENT SCARS. THE BOARD MAY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ITS REGULATION AND WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE MEAN FUTURE OUTBREAKS. HOW FOR THIS SERVICE. A TOP CONCERN FOR. SAFETY THE BOARD HAD A CASE JEFF THIS YEAR WHEN INDIVIDUAL PASSED AWAY AS A RESULT OF CALM PATIENTS ASSOCIATE A BACK. DOOR HOWEVER WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN CLEAN BASIN. BUT A PRODUCT THAT FIVE TWENTY IT WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE THEY BURN. THEN BECAME INFECTED WHICH LEAD TO AMPUTATION. AND THE EVENTUAL DEMISE OF THE INDIVIDUAL. DO ARE COORDINATED CONSUMER AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS PARTICULARLY DURING SANDAL SEASON CONSUMERS ARE BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF. PEDICURES PERFORMED IMPROPERLY. HOWEVER WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE HARM IN MANY OTHER AREAS. OVER PROCESSED HAIR IS QUICKLY BECOMING A TOP CONSUMER COMPLAINT. WHILE WE MIGHT NOT SEE A DEATH FROM A BAD CHEMICAL HERE SERVICE WE DO SEE CONSUMERS THAT HAVE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. ONLY TO EXPERIENCE EXCESSIVE BREAKAGE HAIR LOSS SCALP BURNS OR HAVE THEIR HERE TURN IN AN INTENDED COLOR. WITH THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF BARBER SHOPS AND THE POPULARITY OF MEN WEARING BEARDS THEY'RE ALSO COMES AN INCREASED RISK. TO AN INCREASED RISK OF HARM TO MAIL CONSUMERS WE ARE SEEING CASES OF RINGWORM AND FROM DIRTY BARBER TOOLS. BARBER H. WHICH IS A FUNGAL INFECTION OF FACIAL SKIN COSTS FROM BEARD SERVICES USING DIRTY OR CONTAMINATED TOOLS. FAXING SERVICES REMAIN ANOTHER TOP CONSUMER THREAT WE OFTEN SEE FACIAL BURNS RESULTING FROM THE IMPROPER APPLICATION OF WAX THAT WAS TOO HOT FOR THE SKIN. SKIN CARE SERVICES ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CONSUMER DEMANDS AND WE ARE FINDING MANY INSTITUTIONS ARE PERFORMING SERVICES THAT BELONG IN A MEDICAL OFFICE AND NOT A BEAUTY SALON. SOME ALL TOO OFTEN EXAMPLES OF CITED VIOLATIONS INCLUDE NEEDLES FOR BOTOX INJECTIONS COOL SCULPTING TO ELIMINATE FAT AND CELLULITE. AND VARIOUS FILLERS USED TO PLANT THE LIPS. OR DECREASE WRINKLES. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY THE BOARD HAS INCREASED BY 22% WITH FACIAL BURNS DOUBLING SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. OUR BOARD ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM RELIES HEAVILY ON OUR CITATION AND FIND PROGRAM WE HAVE INSPECTORS THAT ARE IN THE FIELD DALY INSPECTING FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS IN THE FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS. IN FISCAL YEAR CONDUCTED OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS AND ISSUED OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND CITATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. IN ADDRESSING THE CONSUMER HARM IN THIS INDUSTRY WE HAVE INCREASED OUR PRESENCE IN SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THE I MEAN WE HAVE INCREASED OUR PRESENCE IN SCHOOLS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY CORPS THAT IS NOW A REQUIRED PART OF THE CURRICULUM. TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE LICENSE FEES ARE MORE EQUIPPED WITH THE EDUCATION THEY NEED TO KEEP CONSUMER FAITH. I'LL NOW TURN IT BACK TO MS KAHN TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER. AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY IN THE PORT HAS JOINED OVERSIGHT OVER THE PRIVILEGE SCHOOLS ALONG WITH A PAIR OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY. MOST SCHOOLS HAVE WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS A CLINIC FLOOR. WHERE CONSUMER CAN GO IN AND RECEIVE SERVICES FROM A STUDENT THAT IS COMPLETING THEIR CURSE OF INSTRUCTION. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DURING SCHOOL INSPECTIONS WE FOUND THAT SIGNIFICANT FRAUD WAS TAKING PLACE. WE FOUND MANY SCHOOLS THAT WERE SELLING HOURS TO STUDENTS ONLY TEACHING THEM TO PASS THE TEST. AS WELL AS NOT TEACHING THE BOARD'S RULES AND REGULATIONS. WE REACHED OUT TO THE B. P. P. AND STARTED CONDUCTING JOINT INSPECTIONS. TO DATE WE HAVE CONDUCTED THIRTY SEVEN JOINT INSPECTIONS AND AS A RESULT OF OUR JOINT EFFORTS. THREE EMERGENCY DECISIONS WERE ISSUED FROM THE BPP AND THE SCHOOLS ULTIMATELY CLOSE DOWN. WE PREVENTED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS FROM FRAUDULENTLY RECEIVING LICENSES THAT WE BELIEVE MAKE. A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM POTENTIAL HARM BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WERE TAUGHT ONLY MEMORIZE THE EXAMINATION. AND NOT TO FOLLOW ANY OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS WHICH WE WOULD THEN SEE THE RESULTS OF IN TERMS OF CITATIONS. FOR LICENSEES IN VIOLATION OF OUR BOARD REGULATIONS. THE SCHOOLS WERE ESSENTIALLY DIPLOMA MILLS. SELLING HOURS TO STUDENTS WHO WEREN'T EVEN ATTACKING SCHOOL. NOT ONLY DOES THIS IMPACT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CONSUMERS BUT ALSO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE LICENSEES THEMSELVES SINCE THEY ARE NOT TAUGHT HOW TO PROPERLY PROTECT THEMSELVES. FROM CHEMICAL PRODUCTS USED SINCE ONE ENVIRONMENTS OR TO PROPERLY DISINFECT TOOLS THAT COULD CAUSE THEMSELVES AS WELL AS CONSUMERS HARM. WELL WE FEEL THIS IS A STEP FORWARD AND PROTECTING STUDENTS WHO ARE CHOOSING THIS INDUSTRY PROFESSION FOR THEIR ECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD. AS WELL AS CONSUMERS FROM HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK WE DO BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER FRAUDULENTLY OPERATING SCHOOLS REMAINING. AFTER THE EMERGENCY DECISIONS ULTIMATELY SHUT DOWN THOSE THREE BAD SCHOOLS AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT SCHOOLS VOLUNTARILY CLOSER DOORS NEVER TO BE HEARD OF AGAIN. NOT ONLY ARE STUDENTS FROM BAD SCHOOLS NOT BEING PROVIDED VALUABLE HEALTH AND SAFETY EDUCATION THERE ARE ALSO MISSING OUT ON INFORMATION REGARDING BASIC LABOR LAWS ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. ANTI RETALIATION LAWS AND WAGE RATES ALL OF WHICH IS REQUIRED TO BE PRE ARE PROVIDED TO STUDENTS AS PART OF THE BOARDS HEALTH AND SAFETY COURSE. THE BOARD IS AWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON DEREGULATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT SERVICES SHOULD REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL LICENSE AND STATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. OUR BOARD IS VERY OPEN TO THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THE HOPES THAT EVERYONE INVOLVED WILL BE THOUGHTFUL AND DILIGENT AND THE BOARDS MISSION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. OUR BOARD IS READY AND WILLING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH ALL OF YOU AS POLICYMAKERS. AND TO DISCUSS REFORMS. THAT COULD SET THE STANDARD FOR MANY OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW. OUR UNIQUE VANTAGE POINT OF BEING FOR. HARLEY I CONSUMER PROTECTION COULD HELP ELIMINATE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR US REVISED WITH WHAT WE HOPE IS HELPFUL INFORMATION AND MOVING FORWARD IN THE SENSE THAT REVIEW PROCESS. GOOD THANK YOU MISSED ON AND DOCTOR WILLIAMS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH AND- I'M TO CLEAR PUSH OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF SCHOOL CLOSURES MAKING SURE THAT THAT EDUCATION IS EXACTLY WHAT THE STUDENTS. WOULD EXPECT TO GET. SO YOUR YOUR WORK IN THAT AREA IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO MAY HAVE TIME SCHEDULES. THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN MINE AND MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO DEFER TO THEM IF THEY WANT TO. ASK ANYTHING AT THE AT THE HEAD. YEP CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU FOR APPEARING BEFORE US TODAY REALLY APPRECIATED. I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IN DEPTH. YOU GO INTO SECURING A PROTECTING. NOT ONLY YOUR INDUSTRY BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC. CONGRATULATIONS AND I AM VERY VERY IMPRESSED. WITH THE FACT THAT. YOU HAVE GONE INTO SO MANY SCHOOLS. AND LOOKED IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS. AND EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'VE CLOSE SOME DOWN THE POLICING THAT YOU'RE DOING. IS FANTASTIC. MY QUESTION IS. WHEN A SMALL SHOP. WHERE THE B. BEAUTY SHOP BARBERSHOP WHATEVER HAS AN ISSUE. THAT MISS WILLIAMS THAT DISCUSSED. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR INSURANCE THAT THE THERE THAT THE GROUP ALL ADDS THAT THERE'S A FINE THAT. THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND COULD GO TO WHERE WHERE DOES THAT COME TO COMPENSATION WHEN SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG IT IS THEIR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR INDUSTRY WHEN. SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO PROTECT AND GIVE RESTITUTION TO THE CONSUMER. WELL THE FIRST OPTION THAT THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HAVE A FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BOARD AND THEN WE HAVE INSPECTORS THAT REVIEW THE COMPLAINT AND IN OUR CITATION DEPARTMENT IN SACRAMENTO. THEY REACH OUT TO THE INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS TO THE LICENSE FEE AND THEN WE BEGIN THE INVESTIGATION FROM THERE. AND DO WE HAVE. WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE SO YES AT THE SALON OWNER I DO HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE SO THAT IF SOMETHING WAS FILED AGAINST MYSELF OR ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES AND THAT INDIVIDUAL IS PROTECTED.AND I BELIEVE THAT MOST LICENSE EVEN THE FATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WHEN WORKING IN ESTABLISHMENT. THERE SHOULD BE LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT COVERS THAT LOCATION AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN THAT LOCATION. SO I WOULD IMAGINE BE VERY IMPORTANT. TO NOT ONLY CHECK THE STATUS OF THE LICENSE THEIR HISTORY. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE INSURANCE IN ITS CURRENT AND UP TO DATE IN THE EVENT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN. YES I DO KNOW THAT. I'M NOT SURE OF THE BOARD DO WE WOULD REQUIRE IT WE DON'T REQUIRE THE LIABILITY INSURANCE I'M SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND HAVING MY SALON WHERE I LEAVE MY FAITH IS A REQUIREMENT OF MY LEASE AND I'M SURE THAT MOST BUSINESSES REQUIRE THAT. PARTICULAR INSURANCE FOR THAT BUSINESS. MISTER CHAIR I THINK I'VE I MAY HAVE STUMBLED ON SOMETHING BECAUSE OF WE HAVE ONE SALON OR ONE. PROFESSIONAL WHO MAY HAVE ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE LIABILITY INSURANCE WHERE THE NEXT YEAR MAY NOT OR THE NEXT SHOP MAY NOT. THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE GOD FORBID SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN. AND WHO DO WE TURN TO. THAT'S THE ISSUE YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT SOMEONE PASSED AWAY. YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THE FACT THAT THE EQUIPMENT MAY NOT BIG. PLANS PROPERLY AND WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE ACROSS THE BOARD THAT EVERY CONSUMERS EQUALLY PROTECTED. SO I THINK I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT AND SEE HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO. HAVE IN YOUR INDUSTRY A FLAT BLANKET. OF LIABILITY INSURANCE THAT IS EITHER PAID THROUGH A FUND. OR SOME WAY THAT EVERY SHOP IN EVERY CONSUMER. IS PROTECTED. CENTERS LETTER WE AT TAKE YOUR COMMENTS TO HEART AND THAT MY STAFF AND- BOARD WILL EXAMINE THAT IN MORE DETAIL AND THAT WE- HAVE FUTURE. HEARINGS ON THE ISSUE HELP TO REPORT BACK TO YOU ON THAT THANK YOU. AT CHIRLA TANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER AND AGAIN THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF PARTICULAR FOR THE OF BOARD MEMBERS FOR YOUR SERVICE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT IS A LABOR OF LOVE AND ZERO HERE VOLUNTEER SERVICES VERY MUCH APPRECIATED TO THE STATE I JUST QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO ON DEMAND SERVICES HE WAS ALLUDED TO OTHER DYNAMICS DECISION THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT WORK FORCE IN THE FUTURE OF THAT OF THE WORK FORCE. CAN TO SORT OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING TO BEST UNDERSTAND AND I'LL WORK WITH THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND THAT. OF CONSUMER. WITH A. ON DEMAND SERVICES IN THE TECH COMPANIES IN WHICH YOU CAN. GET AROUND THAT OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR BUT THEN. GO DIRECTLY TO HOME THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPANIES INCLUDED WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS. RIGHT TELL ACTUALLY IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT'S BEEN A HUGE PART OF THE WORK THAT THE BOARD HAS DONE. RELATED TO PERSONAL SERVICE PAYMENT. AND WE DID HAVE QUITE A FEW. PUBLIC HEARINGS ALONG THE PROCESS TO. BEST UNDERSTAND HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A PERMIT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE WORKING. FOR THESE ON DEMAND SERVICES ON IN THEIR HOME AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY. MOVING AT PACKAGE THROUGH REGULATION. RIGHT NOW. SPECIFIC TO THE PERSONAL SERVICE PERMIT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE TIME LINE FOR THAT WILL BE BUT IT IS. LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DRAFTED AND SUBMITTED. AND THEN THE SPECIFICALLY TO THAT OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION AS WEALTH AND HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO PASS A COMPANY TO UNDERSTAND. OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EXISTS WITH THAT AND THEN ARTICULATED THAT TO THE MOVING COMPONENTS AND HOW THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT. WITHIN THAT OF THE LICENSEES. WE HAVE. HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND- ALSO ATTENDED SOME TRADE SHOWS WHERE THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY SPECIFIC WORKSHOPS HELD. TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE'VE BEEN. TAKING A LOT FILLED IN A LOT OF CALLS AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS M. IT'S DEFINITELY KIND OF OUT OF OUR PURVIEW TO GIVE TOO MANY DETAILS TO OUR LICENSEES SO WE'RE KIND OF WAITING FOR THINGS AS THEY COME OUT WE POSTED ON OUR OUR AND SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE REACH MOST OF OUR- M. LICENSEES BUT WE'RE TRYING TO AT LEAST pSPECIALLY WHEN AB FIVE CAME OUT WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ON THAT AS AT OUR BOARD MEETINGS AS WELL AND HAVE INSURED ARE ALL OF OUR FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS ON INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS THAT IS SEEN AS MORE INFORMATION COMES OUT TO US THAT WE PASS IT ON TO THEM. SO I HAD A SERIES OF QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF LICENSING ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. AND THAT MAYBE I COULD START WITH WHAT THE ONE THAT SAID. THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ANSWER WHEN SOMEONE TALKS TO ME ABOUT IT AND THAT'S THE- REQUIREMENT OF UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. OF TRAINING NECESSARY. AND I THINK YOU BROKE IT DOWN. A FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS FOR HAIR SIXTEEN HUNDRED FOR COSMETOLOGY IS THAT RIGHT SOMETHING TO THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THEIR- AND I THINK YOU SPOKE TO THAT THAT'S TEN MONTHS FULL TIME. RIGHT SO TO BE A POLICE OFFICER IN OUR STATE. REQUIRES ABOUT HALF OF THAT. AMOUNT OF TRAINING. TO BE A POLICE OFFICER. I DON'T KNOW FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON WHO IS A GREAT FRIEND ONLINE FORCING KNEW THAT. THAT WILL REQUIRE IN IN THE COSMETOLOGY AREAS. IS TRAINING TWICE THAT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CARRIES A GUN. CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT THAT ISSUE AND I EACH SHARED THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT IS DONE ON A PERSON'S FACE FOR SKIN AND ON THEIR HAIR ON THEIR NAILS BUT CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THE PERSON ON THE STREET HE SAYS A STEVE I'D LIKE TO GET INTO THIS FIELD BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE ME AND AS YOU DESCRIBE IT TEN MONTHS FULL TIME. AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THESE ARE TUITION. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE'S HAIR CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. YES AS A LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST I DO KNOW THAT IN COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC OR PERSON. WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DIFFERENT COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND SO ESTATE IT WHEN YOU HAVE. WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN THIS ONLINE ENVIRONMENT THEN THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY LENTILS ARE NOT DISINFECTED ARE CLEANED PROPERLY. OF CAUSING INFECTION AND S AS I LISTED IN MY PORTION OF MY OVERVIEW THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET FROM INFECTIONS THAT CAUSE HARM TO INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO BE AWARE. OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES NOT JUST FOR THE HARM THAT CAN COME TO THEIR CLIENT BUT ALSO PERSONALLY. WE DID DO AN OVERVIEW OF OUR COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM I FIFTEEN HUNDRED OUR COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM KNOWING THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITHIN A COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM COVER NOT ONLY HAIR STYLING. ALSO MANY CARING AND IS THAT IT. AND WITHIN THAT ROOM OVER TODAY. IS THE SIXTEEN HOUR COURSE NOT VERY. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S INTERESTED IN HAIR STYLING AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IN DEPTH. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD SAY AS SOMEONE WHO PRACTICES NOT ONLY BARBERING BUT COSMETOLOGY. WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE BIOLOGY OF AN INDIVIDUAL THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- AS I'VE ALREADY STATED THAT YEAH. Q. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TODAY MAYBE AND JUST AND FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IT'S A- DEATH IT'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION ANSWER TODAY BUT- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND YOU TALK ABOUT INFECTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND CERTAINLY NOTHING I WOULD EVER ARGUE WITH BUT- SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WITHIN THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS HOW MUCH IS DEDICATED TO THE ISSUE OF INFECTION I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT. WERE IN FRONT OF ME LIKE THAT THAT NUMBER OF HOURS IF YOU KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER. I BELIEVE IT'S A BROWN'S AM HEALTH AND SAFETY USUALLY COVERS AND MENTOR COURSES AROUND TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED HOURS. OKAY SO TWO HUNDRED HOURS THIS IS LAWS AND REGULATIONS DISINFECTION AND SANITATION. OTHER AREAS SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE BETWEEN TEN AND 20% OF THE EDUCATION WELL IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME MAYBE FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO. UNDERSTAND THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUR REQUIREMENT EXACTLY WHAT THE TRAINING THAT GOES INTO THAT SO WE COULD MORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW. SOMEBODY SAYS TO ME HEY STEVE I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE'S HAIR I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING BUT I. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I DO IT RIGHT. IT'S A PRETTY BIG BARRIER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS TEN MONTHS RIGHT. CORRECT YEAH SO THAT WOULD IT WOULD HELP ILLUMINATE THE ARC OUR CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE SPECIFICS OF THAT EDUCATION REQUIREMENT OKAY. I'M INTERESTED AND A YOU HAVE A SET THE- SINCE PART OF THIS WORLD THAT YOU'RE IN AND I'M SURE YOU DEAL. WITH IT ON SEVEN A LEVELS IN THE PERSON. SOMEONE OPERATE WITHOUT A- YOU GIVE US A CAN YOU GIVE THE ARE COMMITTEES A SENSE OF. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF A LICENSE ESTABLISHMENT YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THAT. WE DON'T FIND A LOT OF UNLICENSED ESTABLISHMENT USUALLY THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD IT PLANE FOR. THE BUSINESS LICENSE THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE SALON AND IT'S A FIFTY DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE SO WHEN WE DO FIND AMONG LICENSE THAT PRETTY WILLING TO GET THAT SHOP LICENSE RIGHT AWAY. WE DO FIND UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN PHONE LINES AM I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME ON THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE CAN PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEES. IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR PLACE THAT THAT YOU SEE MORE ACTIVITY IN THE SAY I'M LICENSE SPACE THAN OTHERS. NOT REALLY. WE DEFINITELY. SEE LESS AND WE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS VERY HAS OF MUCH HIGHER POPULATION IN GENERAL SO WE DEFINITELY ARE SEEN MORE IN THE AND LOS ANGELES AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY MORE SALONS IN THAT AREA AND WE DON'T SEE IT AS MUCH UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT WE SEE IT. WE SEE IT AS WELL. SO I GUESS IT'S A LOT EASIER TO HAVE TO SEE IT AND ENFORCEMENT ISSUE WHEN SOMEONE PUTS A- GETS A BRICK AND MORTAR ESTABLISH AND PUTS A SIGN OUT AND GETS A BUSINESS LICENSE OF SOME KIND. RIGHT BUT BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO PRACTICE THAT THEIR WORK IN SOMEONE'S HOME THE HAVE ANY SENSE OF FAT. HOW BIG OF AN ISSUE IT IS. THAT THAT I'M LICENSE ACTIVITY. WE MIGHT BE ABLE WE MIGHT HAVE DATA ON THAT BECAUSE WE DO. GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT AND LICENSE ACTIVITY IN AREAS OTHER THAN SALONS AND WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HOMES THE ONES AS WELL SO THERE WE DO HAVE QUITE A QUITE A FEW IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WHO HAVE. SORT OF TRANSITION PART OF THEIR HOME INTO A SALON WHICH IS TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE AND SO WE HAVE HOME SALONS THAT ARE LEGITIMATE AS AS WELL BUT I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS ON EXACTLY HOW MANY COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE OF UNLICENSED WORKERS I DON'T THINK IT'LL HIGH EARLIER TODAY IN THE TESTIMONY I THINK I HEARD THAT THAT THAT MAY BE REFERRING TO LAST YEAR FORTY TWO HUNDRED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. THAT I HEAR THAT SO OF THOSE FORTY TWO HUNDRED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS HOW MANY WERE THE- INVOLVED IN ON LICENSE INDIVIDUAL GENERA. AM I DO NOT KNOW AM. I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THE HIGH NUMBER. YOU'VE DONE A LEVIN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS ACT BUT JUST IF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET THAT DETAIL IF YOU HAVE IT ON THE COMPLAINTS ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS LAST YEAR DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY IT'S A LOT OF INSPECTIONS HOW BIG OF A ENFORCEMENT TEAM YOU HAVE TO DO ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE INSPECTORS AND THAT TO COVER ABOUT FORTY SIX THOUSAND A MONTH HAVE THOSE ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS THAT WERE DONE DO YOU KNOW AN OFF HAND HOW MANY WERE OF THE NINE LICENSES SOLIDITY OR ON LICENSE INDIVIDUAL. I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS ON HIM BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE COULD PULL IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A LOT EASIER ONCE AGAIN TO GO AFTER IT ESTABLISHMENTS BUT AT. E. L. EIGHT. I'M TRYING TO GET MY HANDS OUT OF THE ON LICENSE COMMUNITY OUT THERE AND IS IT ANY. AGAIN IS THE INSPECTIONS A DATA POINT TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF. LICENSE BUSINESSES. WHEN OUR INSPECTORS DO GO OUT THEY KIND OF FOCUS ON AN AREA SO IF AN INSPECTOR GOES OUT TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION THEY'LL USUALLY TRY TO COVER ANYTHING CLOSE IN THAT AREA SO THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD FIND SOME UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IF WE FIND AN UNLICENSED ESTABLISHMENT. M. AND AGAIN WE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE COULD PULL. OKAY WOULD BE HELPFUL TO TRY I MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON IT I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS COULD I GET A HAND HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS IT. YEAH WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CANNABIS WORLD AND TALK ABOUT THE LICENSE CANNABIS WORLD IN THE UNLICENSED CAB GET OUT OF THIS WORLD. AND HOW BIG OF A SUCCESS OR FAILURE WERE HAVING IN GETTING WITHIN THE LICENSE SPACE. I'D BE GOOD IF YOU COULD HAVE THAT SENSE TO ENSURE THAT WITH US HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS IT. OF PEOPLE OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE. AND HOW ARE THEY DOING IT. AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO I THINK TO US. EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE DONE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND YOU MENTION PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND YOU SPEND SOMETIME TALKING IMPORTANTLY ABOUT. PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE EXPLOITED THEY'RE WORKING AT IT IN FACT IF THE WORK TO CLOSE THEM DOWN DO YOU HAVE ANY BREAKDOWN AS TO HOW MUCH OF THAT. TRAINING IS DONE BETWEEN PRIVATE. INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX APPROVED SCHOOLS AND I BELIEVE LESS THAN TEN OF THOSE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND AS THE BOARD YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IF THE STUDENT CAN GET THAT TYPE OF TRAINING AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GONNA SAY THE HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY. RIGHT AND OPTIONS AND PERHAPS GET EVEN A BETTER EDUCATION. WHAT WORK IS THE BOARD DOWN TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO. BE MORE ACTIVE IN AND THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION WORK. WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT DON'T OFFER THE COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM WE'VE WORKED WITH THE ONES THAT THAT DO. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY OUTRAGE TO OTHER CAN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE NOT OFFERING THAT THE PROGRAMS IT SOUNDS LIKE AS YOU DESCRIBE IT THAT OUR OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE LESS THAN 10% MAYBE EVEN FIVE PERCENT. OF THE TRAINING IN THIS AREA SUCH A REASONABLE RIGHT INCLUSION FROM WHAT SHE SAID. AND YET YOU HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND LICENSEES. SALADA PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SPACE. IT SEEMS THAT IF WE HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE TRAINED RIGHT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS YOU ENCOUNTER WITH SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING IT RIGHT. AND WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN OUR PBLIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY OVER WHAT THEY DO. AND WHEN PEOPLE TALK TO BE ABOUT HOW DO WE GET OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY MAY SEE. ECONOMICALLY JUST SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THIS IS A SPACE THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE ACTIVE THAN. MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ABOUT FURTHER. I CERTAINLY WOULD RATHER SE OUR COMMITTEE COLLEGES. OFFERING THESE PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS NOT TO THEIR- DETRIMENT BUT HEY YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT EFFICIENT. RIGHT EFFECTIVE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO. IMPROVE THEIR- ECONOMIC. PROSPECTS AND CERTAINLY IN THE IN THE BARBARY AND COSMETOLOGY FEEL GIVEN HOW MANY PEOPLE UTILIZE IT IT SEEMS LIKE. WE MAYBE IF WE MAY. WE MAY BE FALLING SHORT I'D LOVE TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION. ON THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT TATTOO ARTISTS THEY'RE THEY'RE IN YOUR PURVIEW ONE DAY THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT IN YOUR FOR YOU. TWO CUPS TATTOOS. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A DC A BOARD THAT COVERS TIED TO THE BELIEVE IT FALLS THAT LOOK ON LOCAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT. REALLY. WELL IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A MANIPULATION OF SKIN. DEATH I'D BE INTERESTED IN ANY THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE AS A BOARD AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO THAT ISSUE FROM THE HEALTH AND SAFETY POINT OF VIEW. SO MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER FOLLOW UP BY ISSUE THAT ARE STATUS CANNELLA. CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WE EL WE TALK A LOT IN OUR COMMITTEE ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND- I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHARE ANY THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW THE BOARD OR THE STAFF. LOOKS TO OTHER STATES RATHER COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES IN THIS AREA BE DONE ANY THOUGHT ANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE. WE M. I. ATTENDS THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WHERE. GOOD PORTION OF THE STATE'S GET TOGETHER AND DISCUSS KIND OF COMMON ISSUES THAT WE'RE ALL HAVING THEM WE'VE DEFINITELY LOOKED IT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A LOT OF OTHER STATES ON SOME RECIPROCITY ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING IN THE SELLING OF OURS THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. SO WE WE'VE WORKED WITH A LOT OF OTHER STATES ON THAT ASPECT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING SO MANY FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION LETTERS COMING IN FROM OTHER STATES OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET LICENSE TO BE A RECIPROCITY WITH FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS SO THERE'S THAT ASPECT WE HAVE ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER STATES FOR THEIR- THERE'S SOME OF THEM EDUCATION AS YOU MENTIONED THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. M. AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING IT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION DURING THAT AS WELL I AM MOST STATES ARE AROUND FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT THAT ARE WORKING TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS DOWN TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS WE HAD A COUPLE STATES OF TWENTY ONE HUNDRED HOURS. I AM SO IT'S DEFINITELY A DISCUSS WITH LIKE THE STATE COME TOGETHER TO BE. CLOSER M. AT THE OUT. IT'S THE THOUGHT PROCESS A BETTER THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT STATES. AND IF YOU ADD SO I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT TYPE OF COMPARISON THAT NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FIVE HOURS AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DISCUSSION OF OURS IS NOT ABOUT A- STATE TO DEREGULATE. IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND ARE THERE BARRIERS FAIR BARRIERS. UNFAIR BARRIERS TO ACCESS. AND SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED AND YOUR- IDEA WORK ON BEST PRACTICES A BAND BEYOND THE ISSUE OF OURS. AND WE HAD A HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO. DEALING WITH SERVICE MEMBERS WHO WERE TRANSFERRED. AND HOW THE HOW CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE SPOUSES OF SERVICE MEMBERS. WHO HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT TRANSFER. COULD BE LIMITED BY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND A LACK OF RECIPROCITY. HAVE YOU AND THE BOARD HAVE ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WHETHER THAT'S AN ISSUE AND OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS THAT YOU COULD BE PROVIDING SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES THAT. ARE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO RECIPROCITY MOST PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER STATES SPECIALLY IN IN THE SERVICE AREA. ARE USUALLY IMMEDIATELY QUALIFY FOR OUR LICENSE HERE WE PUT ANYONE WE HAVE THE QUESTIONS ON OUR APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS OUR ONLINE FORMS OF THEIR PART OF THE MILITARY OR IF THEY HAVE A SPOUSE THAT THE MILITARY. AND WE EXPECT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND PROCESS THEM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SO WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT AT ALL WE'VE BEEN WE'VE PUT THAT AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST TO PROCESS THEM. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY SEEN ON THE WEB PAGE. ONE WHO'S CALLING FROM MARYLAND INCOME IF YOU'RE FROM ARKANSAS AND THEY LOOK AT YOUR- INFORMATION IS A PRETTY CLEAR THAT HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS THAT WE DO WE HAVE A MILITARY BUTTON ON OUR- ON OUR HOME.

FIGHT. A GROUP IS A. COME ON UP TO LEAD TO SHARE THEIR THEIR THOUGHTS AS WE- COMPLETE OUR HEARING. WELCOME PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO CHAIR MEMBERS FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION CALIFORNIA. A NON LICENSEE. THE JUST BRIEF BACKGROUND THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. BY VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT SACRAMENTO IS DOING MORE THINGS TO US RATHER THAN FOR US TO BE CANDID. MAN THAT THERE WAS IN THE UNITED VOICE FOR ALL THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF OUR INDUSTRY SPEAKING ABOUT ISSUES. AND SEND IT IMPORTANCE THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN REACH A LARGE CONSENSUS ON. SO THE MISSION OF MY ORGANIZATION IS SIMPLE TO RAISE THE PROFESSIONALISM OF BEAUTY IN CALIFORNIA WE FIGURE A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL SHIPS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME TRENDS IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT GO AGAINST THAT. AND THE WHOLE TOUCH UPON THOSE BRIEFLY. BUT I TRY MY BEST IN IN TWENTY YEARS I BY THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT ON TWO THOUSAND. TOTAL FOR NINETEEN YEARS I'VE REPRESENTED THIS INDUSTRY. AND I'VE MISSED ONE STATE BOARD MEETING IN TWENTY YEARS. SO I'VE BEEN A DILIGENT ADVOCATE FOR THIS INDUSTRY MY BOARD MEMBERS REPRESENT EVERY SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY. INCLUDING SCHOOLS INDIVIDUAL LICENSEES INDEPENDENT SALONS CHAIN SALONS INDIVIDUAL US PRINTERS WITCHER ESSENTIALLY SOLE PROPRIETORS. ALL SECTORS PLACE IN SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY. MONDAY NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING TO A FEW HUNDRED SALON OWNERS ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THROUGH A LIVE WEBCAST IS DEFINITIONS SENT SHOCK WAVES. THROUGH OUR INDUSTRY. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANTED. TO EXPRESS TO YOU ALL TODAY. OUR INDUSTRY HAS REALLY SEEN UPHEAVAL COMING FROM SACRAMENTO HUGE CHANGES AND NOT TO SACRAMENTO FROM THE STATE SUPREME COURT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS CODIFIED AND CLARIFIED THAT COMMISSION WAGES FOR EMPLOYEES IS ESSENTIALLY ILLEGAL AS WE PRACTICE IT AND AS OUR INDUSTRY IT'S PRACTICE DID. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. BECAUSE AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN CLARIFIES THAT IF YOU ARE SELLING YOUR OWN SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S PRODUCT OR SERVICES YOU CANNOT RECEIVE COMMISSIONS. AND AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN FIVE YEARS AGO CREATED A PIECE RATE STRUCTURE WHICH IS VERY COMPLICATED TO IMPLEMENT IN A SALON SETTING ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE OF OUR STYLIST HAS TO CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT EVERY TIME THEY GO ON A BREAK EVERY TIME THEY GO ON LUNCH. EVERY TIME THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ACTIVE SERVICE. BECAUSE THE INTENT OF AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN WAS TO MAKE SURE. THAT FOR SO LONG INDIVIDUAL STYLIST RECEIVING A PIECE OF THEIR SERVICES. IN TERMS OF PAY. THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HARMED FOR IT LEGAL BREAKS OR WE SEE THE SAME COMMENSURATE PAY WHEN THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING A SERVICE BUT STILL UNDER THE EMPLOYEE AND CONTROLLED THEIR SALON OWNER. THAT HAS BEEN A VERY BIG MUCH FOR EMPLOYER BASED SALONS. HOWEVER AT LEAST THREE QUARTERS OF OUR SALONS ARE NOT EMPLOYER BASED THEIR BOOTH RENTAL OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. SO THEY A SKATE THE RECENT UPHEAVAL REGARDING THE LACK OF BEING ABLE TO PAY COMMISSIONS. DYNAMAX COMES ALOG A YEAR AGO LAST APRIL IN A PEACEFUL FOR BOOTH RENTAL HUGE CHANGE COMING DOWN THE PIKE CLEARLY THE STATE REGULATORS. AT T. D. I. R. IT CETERA HAVE NOT REALLY ACTED UPON DYNAMIX WAITING FOR ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE AND THE POLICY MAKING BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT YOU ALL TO ACT FIRST. IF AND WHEN AB FIVE BECOME STATUTE. EVENTUALLY THE STATE REGULATORS WILL START ENFORCING DYNAMICS AND THE BE PART OF DYNAMAX ESSENTIALLY OUTLAWS ALMOST EVERY FORM OF FINAL AS CURRENTLY PRACTICED IN OUR INDUSTRY AND AGAIN AS I STATED EARLIER THREE QUARTERS OF OUR SALONS. UTILIZED TRAINERS SO THIS IS AN ERA OF MAJOR CHANGE TORE INDUSTRY. I WOULD CAUTION WITH ALL DUE HUMILITY AND RESPECT FOR THE WORK THESE TWO JOINT COMMITTEES ARE DOING. TO AVOID THE TEMPTATION OF SENDING EVEN MORE DRAMATIC REFORMS ARE WAY. THE STATE BOARD IS YOU HEARD ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY HAS WORKED FOR TWO YEARS AMPLE MANNER RESPONSIBLE MEANS CREATING FREELANCE LICENSE OUTSIDE. STATUTES THE PERSONAL SERVICE. THAT WAS A HUGE LEFT FOR OUR INDUSTRY HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN PLAYABILITY CURRENTS FOR EXAMPLE AND VERY FIRST TUMORS WHEN THE SERVICES AREN'T EVEN BEING DONE IN A LICENSED ESTABLISHMENT THAT CAN BE INSPECTED. INSPECTORS DEFINITIONS THE THOSE. SO LIABILITY INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE REGULATORY LANGUAGE FOR PERSONAL SERVICE PERMIT. APPLICATIONS RECOGNIZE ESSENTIALLY THERE'S NO WAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO INSPECT THOSE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF BRICK AND MORTAR AND SO AT THE VERY LEAST THEY COULD REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE MINIMUM GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE SO I BELIEVE THE STATE BOARD HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE. IN TACKLING THAT TOUGH ISSUE I KNOW IT'S A PRIORITY OF A CHAIRMAN LOW. WITH THE GIG ECONOMY IT CETERA. AND I DO WANNA SEE WORD ABOUT THE STATE BOARD WHEN I STARTED REPRESENTING THIS INDUSTRY NINETEEN YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T HAVE A BOARD THEN IT WAS A BUREAU OF A FEW YEARS LATER WE- A SPONSORED LEGISLATION SENATOR POLANCO TO BRING BACK THE STATE BOARD STRUCTURE. THE REASON WAS A STATE BOARD HAS TO DO ALL THEIR WORK IN PUBLIC ALL OF THEIR HEARINGS OUR LIVE WEBCAST IT AN ARCHIVE YOU CAN. SEE ALL OF THOSE HEARINGS YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF MY RECEDING HAIRLINE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN EACH OF THOSE WEBCASTS. I ORGANIZATION DOES NOT. THE GENDER WE WERE CONCERNED OTHERS DID TWENTY PLUS YEARS AGO A STATE BOARD STRUCTURE BRINGS THE SUNLIGHT UPON THESE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND MY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS THAT SO EVERYTHING I'VE EVER SAID OR ANY OF MY MEMBERS OR ANYBODY FROM THE INDUSTRY IS RECORDED LIVE FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY STAND FOR AND I THINK THAT IN AND OF ITSELF HAS BEEN A PIVOTAL IN CHANGING THE MAKEUP OF THIS BOARD AND THEIR OPERATIONS WHEN I STARTED REPRESENTING THIS INDUSTRY. IT TOOK ON AVERAGE EIGHT MONTHS FOR A GRADUATE TO TAKE THE LICENSING EXAM SO YOU MENTIONED THE EIGHT TO TEN MONTHS IT TAKES FOR SCHOOLING IMAGINE WAITING EQUALLY LONG. JUST TO BE TAPPED FOR THE EXAM. SO THE WORK OF THE STATE BOARD. EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO'S BEEN A LONG TERM MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD AND I WISH WE COULD PASS A LOT OF FORCE HER TO CONTINUE WORKING FOR THE CITY BOARD. IN THE GREAT STATE BOARD MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPORTED CLOTHING THE TWO THAT WERE HERE BEFORE YOU CHANGED ALL OF THAT. AND SO THERE IS NO WAIT TIME. FOR AN EXAMINATION. THE SAME FOR SALON OWNERS IT WOULD TAKE EIGHT TEN MONTHS FOR THEM TO HAVE AN APPEAL HEARING ON ANY CITATION GIVEN BY ONE OF THE STATE BOARD INSPECTORS WHICH BY THE WAY WHEN I FIRST STARTED REPRESENT IN THIS INDUSTRY THE INSPECTORS NOT ONLY GAVE THE INSPECTION REPORT THE ATTACHED A MONETARY SANCTION. AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION. THE WORKING WITH STATE BOARD STAFF OVER THE YEARS. THEY'VE CHANGED ALL THAT SO NOW A STATE BOARD INSPECTOR ONLY GIVES INSPECTIONS REPORTS INCLUDING PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND THEY SUBMIT THAT TO SACRAMENTO'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WHO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THAT LICENSEE WHO LOOK AT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INFRACTIONS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO COMMUNICATE BEFORE A MONETARY SANCTION IS EVER ATTACHED. THAT KINDA DUE PROCESS IT'S JUST ONE OF A HUNDRED DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF WHAT I'D SAY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS BY THE STATE BOARD. TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN A. AB HELPFUL WAY LET'S JUST PUT IT THAT WAY SO WE'VE BEEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR MARK ASSOCIATIONS VANTAGE POINT OF OUR STATE BOARD AND THEIR SERVICES TO OUR INDUSTRY AND TO PROTECTING OUR- CLIENTELE. I DO WNT TO HIT UPON BARRIERS TO ENTRY I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN SB NINE NINE NINE WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR SENATOR NGUYEN HAD THE BILL THE YEAR BEFORE THAT OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT CHIPPING AWAY AT LICENSE SCOPE OF PRACTICE SUMMER BY THE WAY JUST TRYING TO OBLITERATE. LICENSING ALTOGETHER. THAT MOVEMENT IS A LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENT AGAINST VOCATIONAL LICENSING THEY'VE LOOKED YOU KNOW SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IT USED TO BE LESS THAN 10% OF THE WORKFORCE WAS LICENSED NOW IT'S PUSHING ONE THIRD AND SO THE LIBERTARIAN STRING SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT WHY IS GOVERNMENT HAVING TO GET IN THE WAY OF YOU MAKING A LIVING. TO GIVE YOU PERMISSION. BY WILL COTTON MEMBERS TO LOOK AT THAT HISTORY IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONIZATION. IT'S BEEN EXACTLY AN INVERSE INVERSE PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH LICENSING IN OTHER WORDS. AS UNIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE DECLINED MEMBERSHIP IN PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL WORK FORCE. LICENSING HAS FILLED THE GAP AS IT WERE. UNIONS USED TO MAINTAIN A LOT OF THE STANDARDS IN THESE LOCATIONS THROUGH THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AT SETTER. AS THEY HAVE ATROPHIED GOVERNMENT HAS FILLED THE VOID TO MAINTAIN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING INVERSE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU ALL OUGHT YOU CONSIDER. IMMEDIATELY DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO START DECREASING LICENSE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO ENTERING THIS INDUSTRY YOU HAD A BACK AND FORTH ABOUT PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS. WELL THERE'S A PRINT SHIPS AFTER THIRTY NINE HOURS OF THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION. YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY GO TO WORK EARNING WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING AS AN APPRENTICE IN THIS INDUSTRY THIRTY NINE HOURS HIS WORK. THERE CAPPED AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TOTAL AN APPRENTICE CANNOT BE CHARGED MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BY THEIR PROGRAM SPONSOR OR ANYBODY. SO THERE IS ONE AVENUE FOR LICENSE. MOREOVER MY ASSOCIATION CREATED AN EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM AFTER 60% OF YOUR THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION YOU ARE NOW ENTITLED BY LAW TO GO TO A SALON TO BECOME AN X. TURN FOR AN INTERN BUT WE CALLED EXTERNAL. YOU CAN'T BE PAID THAT'S A PROBLEM WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE PAID SO YOU AGAIN YOU CAN EARN WHILE YOU LEARN THE APPRENTICE ONLY HAD THIRTY NINE HOURS. AND CAN BE PAID. IF SOMEONE TED NINE HUNDRED HOURS OF INSTRUCTION WHY CAN'T THEY ALSO BE PAID. THEY CAN ALSO RECEIVE CLOCK OUR CREDIT FOR THE TIME THAT THE SERVICE AN EXTRA. SO THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF REDUCING THAT BARRIER TO ENTRY. AND BY THE WAY WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW STATES OF THE FIFTY STATES BUT DON'T JUST HAVE RECIPROCITY WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED LICENSE YOUR BY ENDORSEMENT WHICH MEANS IF YOU'VE BEEN LICENSE FOR THREE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN NEW YORK AND YOU WANT TO COME TO CALIFORNIA NO QUESTIONS ASKED ESSENTIALLY AS LONG AS YOU HAVEN'T SHOT SOMEBODY DURING YOUR TIME IN THE SALON. YOU PAY FIFTY DOLLARS AND YOU CAN BE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE MOST GENEROUS WELCOMING RECIPROCITY BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE WHETHER NEW YORK ACCEPTS OUR LICENSE OR NOT WE'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM INTO OUR STATE. THE STATE BOARD MEMBERS MENTION THIS ARTIST HIGHLIGHTED. REGARDING CLOCK OUR CREDIT. THE SINGLE LARGEST NUMBER OF CONSUMER HARM COMPLAINTS HAPPENS IN THE ONE SECTOR OF OUR INDUSTRY THAT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FORMAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. FOUR HUNDRED HOURS FOR MAN A CARING AND SEVEN OF THE TEN TOP CITED VIOLATIONS. ARE IN MANY CURRENT SALONS. SO I THINK THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO FACTORS. AND BY THE WAY ON ON SCHOOLING MY ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS AND ALTERNATIVE TO CLOCK OUR CREDIT. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CLOCK OUR CREDIT UNIVERSITIES. OR IT SEE ISSUES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ARE WILLING TO EMBRACE COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CLOCK HOUR. NOT NECESSARILY TO REPLACE BECAUSE AGAIN THAT WOULD COST SUCH UP PEOPLE ARE SCHOOL SECTOR BUT GIVE PROGRESSIVE SCHOOLS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE TOWARD COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION THE STATE BOARD LAYS OUT ALL OF THE MINIMUM. COMPETENCY STATE YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE A LICENSEE. THE STATE EXAM LICENSE EXAM TEST THOSE COMPETENCIES. ALLOW SCHOOLS TO VERIFY THE PARTICULAR STUDENTS ARE COMPETENT IN THOSE PROTOCOLS AND MOVE THEM ALONG FASTER SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE FOR TEN MONTHS. NOW I CAUTION SOME MAY BE THERE LONGER THAN TEN MONTHS IF THEY'RE LESS COMPETENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF MY SCHOOLS IT SAY LET'S MOVE AT LEAST HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. FINALLY LET ME JUST SAY A WORD ABOUT THE LICENSING EXAM. YOU RECALL I STARTED THIS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO TOOK EIGHT MONTHS FOR STUDENTS TO BE EXAMINED. THE ELECTROLYTIC SAM HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO WE SUPPORTED AN EFFORT TO HAVE THE STATE BOARD ADOPT THE NATIONAL EXAM WHICH UPDATE EACH OF OUR LICENSE CATEGORIES EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM THE INDUSTRY ST THIS IS OUR OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO MAKE A LIVING IN TODAY'S SALONS. THEREFORE THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE TESTED. THE EXAM IS TWO PARTS. ONE EXAM WITH TWO PARTS. THE THEORETICAL IN THE HANDS ON I CANNOT STRESS TO THIS TO YOU ALL HOW IMPORTANT HANDS ON INSTRUCTION IS IN THIS INDUSTRY THESE ARE LEFT BRAIN ARTISTS. ALL THE THEORY IN THE WORLD IS NOT GOING TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT. IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THE TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED HOURS OF FORMAL THEORY INSTRUCTION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY SANITATION PROTOCOLS. EVERY SERVICE DONE AT A SCHOOL. HAS HEALTH AND SAFETY AS ITS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. SCHOOLS ARE INTERESTED IN HOW GOOD THEY CUT HAIR SCHOOLS ARE INTERESTED IN HOUSE SAFELY THEY CUT HAIR SO WHILE THE ONLY RECEIVED TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED THEORETICALTHAT ENTIRE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IS FOCUSED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON YOUR HISTORY AND YOUR EXPERIENCES A VERY ENLIGHTENINGSECOND CAREER SO I'M KIND OF THE JUNIOR AMONGST ALL THE ADVOCATES AND BOARD MEMBERS ARE HERE I'VE ONLY BEEN LICENSE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE MINUTE THAT I GOT SINCE I FIGURED I'D- EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW THIS. AT THE HEAD I'M RUNNING BE COMPETITIVE WITH ALL THOSE TWENTY YEAR OLDS OUT THERE. SO. FACEBOOK GROUP AND WE ARE CALIFORNIA ESTHETICIAN ESTHETICIAN ADVOCACY WE ARE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS RIGHT NOW AND THEN. ALLIANCE IN WHICH WE HAVE ATTENDED AND SPOKEN UP AGAINST MANY OF THE LEGISLATION THAT IS KIND OF COME OUT US THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. ARMS AS THE NAIL TECHS. SENATE SENATE BILL NUMBER TWO IN THE SIX SENATE BILL NINE NINE NINE. AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN B. R. COMPENSATION. AB I AB FIVE CURRENTLY THAT AFFECTS. IN THE LAST ISSUE RENT ROOMS. THE SOMEONE SUTTER IN CALIFORNIA. OF FRED HIS TOUCH MUCH OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO EMBRACE AS PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND- OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. DEAD THE AESTHETICIAN MORE NERDY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ALWAYS IN THE BOOKS WE ARE THE ONES THAT ALWAYS INTO THE CONTINUING CATION AND ARE KEEPING YOU IN EDUCATION COM A LOT MORE IN JERRY BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A QUICK ADVANCEMENT. OF IN TWO. FEDEX WORLD SERVICES AND IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAPPEN HAVE MEDICAL OVERSIGHT OF LICENSEES WE ALSO DON'T IT HASN'T AS AN ENTIRE BOARD HAVE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROP. SEC WHEN MR GLAZER MENTIONED ABOUT THE PLEA BEING HALF THE TIME THAT WE HAVE FOR A COSMETOLOGIST. INTERESTING BECAUSE ONCE WE GET. HUNDRED HOURS SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS THAT'S THE REST OF OUR CAREER WE HAVE NO REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION. WE ALSO HAVE NO PLACE FOR. DEMONSTRATING COMPETENCY AND SHOWING THAT ADVANCED CERTIFICATION OF ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT COME OUT AND HIT OUR INDUSTRY PRETTY QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IN THE STATUS CATEGORY THERE'S NO PLACE FOR A. YES I CERTIFICATION. SO WHEN WE ARE ALLOWED TO APPLY EYELASHES TO A PERSON THAT BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN YOU ESTABLISH THE LICENSE YES THIS XIN WHICH IS THE LAST TIME WE'VE HAD OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF REVISED THAT MEAN JUST HI FALSE EYELASHES TO A PERSON TODAY THAT MEANS SLASH PENSIONS. YES I'M TAKING TO THERE'S A- APB D. PLASTICS LASH WITH A COSMETICS TO MEDICAL GRADE SUPERGLUE TO IN A TO A CLIENT'S EYES. SO THOSE CERTIFICATIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE ON BOARD AS PART OF OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE DO MOVE REALLY QUICKLY. AND I FROM THAT ALSO SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD A SCOPE OF PRACTICE REVISION SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ANOTHER SERVICE THAT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE AN AYE LAST TERM. PROBABLY NONE OF YOU HAD AN EYELASH FOR MAYBE TWO IF YOU I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS SOMETHING IN AN ESTHETICIAN CANNOT DO BECAUSE PERM EYELASHES. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PERMANENT OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE HENCE WHY WE ARE SO APPRECIATED OF YOU LISTENING TO US IN OUR NEED TO HAVE A SCOPE OF PRACTICE REVISION BECAUSE OUR EGGMAN. THE IN THE HOUSE SO QUICKLY. EVERY WEEK TO SEND AN EMAIL TO CHRISTY AND WOULD WITH SOME SORT OF CRAZY THING THAT IS COME FROM OVERSEAS THAT WE ARE NOW TRYING TO DO TO OUR FACES. AND IT'S CRAP SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE OUR LANGUAGE AND TO CONSIDER THAT DODD TECHNOLOGY OF FORMULATIONS AND MACHINERY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US AND THAT SORT OF THING NEED TO MOVE ALONG THE LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE THAT WE NEED A CORRECTED BECAUSE WE LEFT WAY BEHIND WHAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO DO IN NINETEEN. SEVENTY EIGHT. DIFFERENT HI. SPECS OF OUR LIFE. SO I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS BURKE THANK YOU MISTER MISS COCHRAN FOR COMING IN AND SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS AND WE WOULD WELCOME ANY CORRESPONDENCE WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF IN TERMS. OF PRACTICE REVISIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE APPROPRIATE. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL WELCOME THAT I SEE SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPERTISE TESTIMONY MY GOODNESS YOUR- OFFERINGS BUT WE'VE WAITED ABOUT DOING. THAT WOMAN TAPPED TO THERE IT BRAWLS NOW AND EYELASHES ARE PERMANENT AND TOOK IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE. YOUR INDUSTRIES PART OF IS THAT SOMETHING SEPARATE OUT HOW DO YOU. TAKE CARE OF THAT WELL MISTER I SHOULD LET I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE THE CHEERLEADER PICKUP LINE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TESTING GIVE A HIGH SCHOOL SO LOADED ON FOR ME. SET WE MANY OF YOUR I'M. AND SO BUT I HAVE EXPERIENCE FROM THIS GROUP OF VERY VOCAL MEMBERSHIP OF FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IT IS KIND OF A CROSS OVER OTHER STATES HAVE THE PERMANENT MAKE UP AS PART OF THEIR RECALL SMALL OVERSIGHT. BUT WE DO NOT IT'S ALL THE MANAGED BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AT THE REGULATIONS CHANGE BY THE K. G. SO WHETHER YOU CAN DO BEAUTY SERVICES AND PERMANENT MAKEUP SERVICES IN THE SAME ROOM. AS DIFFERENT IN ALL THE COUNTIES WHETHER WE CAN DO TO. SERVICES ON TUESDAY A IN THAT ROOM AND THEN HAVE TO SWITCH THE WHOLE THING OVER FOR THE TORY REQUIREMENTS OF. THE THEIR AGENCY ON THURSDAY FRIDAY SAT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE NOT PART OF OURS PRACTICE SO THE PERMANENT MAKEUP BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE FIBROBLAST OR PLOT PLASMANET WERE PLAN PLAN MERE PANS WHICH YOUR LITTLE WELL VICE THAT CREATES OFF SURGERY AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE LIFT IN YOUR FACE AFTER YOU'VE LITERALLY WELDED WITH A MICROCHIP ON YOUR SKIN. HANNAH IS SO THE SPEECH MUSIC PLACES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO THERE AND INVEST BRINGING THESE THINGS AND BUT A LOT OF OUR ON REGULATED THINGS THAT A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS IN BE SERVICES END UP KIND OF BEING STASHED IN THOSE CATEGORIES. BECAUSE IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THAT HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL. DAYS THERE THERE THERE IT. EVERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER YEAR DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY WITH IT'S ALL RANDOM. SO WHEN THAT CROSSOVER HAPPENS IT'S OUR LICENSE FOR BEAUTY HAS TO GO UP ALL OF OUR STANDARDS FOR THE REGULATIONS HAVE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND THEN WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE A PM YOU CLIENT COME IN WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT DOWN WE NEED TO CHANGE OVER THE ROOM TO BEAT THEIR REGULATIONS AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT DAY. AND HOW IT JUST KIND OF AND- THINGS THAT ARE SEEN AS MORE MEDICAL THAT ARE BEING HIDDEN IN THESE FOR. WE DON'T SEE AS MUCH IN THE BEAUTIFICATION SIR GIVING FACIALS DOING LASH EXTENSIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING. VERY GOOD Q. I CHIRLA. OF THOSE PRACTITIONERS IN IN THE FIELDS TO BEST UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO AND ADVANCING THE TECHNOLOGY SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AS WE ARE NOW GLOBAL ECONOMY FOR. THE ORGANIST CAN YOU SEVEN CALIFORNIA S. IS. IS THAT CORRECT WE HAVE A FACEBOOK GROUP OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OKAY IS FOR LICENSEES ONLY AND THEY'RE ALMOST ALL THE LOS OKAY WE ARE ALL THE GALLON. BRENT.

I'M AYE AT EACH ONE OF THE MEMBERS STATES THEIR LEGAL NAME WHAT CITY THERE IN AND THEIR LICENSE NUMBER. OR THERE'S- AND I GET ALL FIVE THOUSAND. OF INTEGRITY AND UNDERSTANDING WHO WERE TALKING TO AND IT IS THE TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M SURE THERE'S A DIVERSE OPINION OF MANY PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD TO. PRIORITIZE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS A STATE AND WHAT THEIR REGULATORY FOR. THE SHOULD BE WITHIN INDUSTRY AS WELL ABSOLUTELY AND ACTUALLY YOUR COMMUNITY WITH THEM RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE QUESTIONS I ANYBODY ELSE HERE TO TESTIFY ON THIS POP BRING ON THE ON THE ISSUE AT HAND. I SEE A NO ONE SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR COMING.
