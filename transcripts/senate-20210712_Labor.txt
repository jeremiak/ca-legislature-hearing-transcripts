TO TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD FOR THE POST JULY THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD- IN ADDITION IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING- IN YOURS AS I UNDERSTAND IT- THAT THE BILL'S AFFECT ON OTHER THIRTY SEVEN X. SYSTEMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IS AN ISSUE AND YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD TO STRESS WAS CONCERNED TO SET. SOUND ACCURATE PORTRAIT YES THAT IS ACCURATE AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE WE DON'T THINK THERE IS THERE ARE ANY OTHER- A UNITS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS. WILL PROVE CRUCIAL. WE WILL- FIVE THE APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THAT ON THE RECORD IN CONTINUING TO- TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT IN APPRECIATE- OF YOU PUTTING THE MEMBERS ON THE RECORD SO THANK YOU AND NOW YOU MAY PROCEED. VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COSPONSORED BY SEIU CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTY OF VENTURA AB EIGHT TWO SIX IS A NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL THAT WILL ENSURE SPECIFIED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY THIRTEEN. DO NOT HAVE THEIR PENSIONS UNFAIRLY REDUCED BY CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF COMPENSATION OF ALL THE COMPENSATION HERBAL CONSISTENT WITH PEPPER AND STANDING LEGAL PRECEDENT THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT HAS FULL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND IT SEEKS TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE AFFECTING LEGACY EMPLOYEES AND VENTURA COUNTY THAT RECEIVE A FLEXIBLE BENEFIT ALLOWANCE OR AN FBA. THIS COMPENSATION IS PAID EVERY PAY PERIOD TO EVERY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE TO HELP COVER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND THE BENEFIT IS FULLY FUNDED THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE NEW OR ANTICIPATED COSTS AS BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEIR PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS. THE REASON ALAMEDA DECISION BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS SITUATIONS LIKE FTA BUT THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE QUESTIONING WHETHER VENTURA COUNTY'S FTA FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF PERMITTED FORMS OF COMPENSATION. WITHOUT THIS MODEST CLARIFICATION TO EXISTING LAW THE LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES RISK LOSING UP 210% OF THEIR MONTHLY PENSION INCOME WHICH WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO RETIREES WHO HAVE BUDGETED AND PLANNED THEIR LIVES AROUND THEIR EXPECTED PENSION AMOUNT. TESTIFYING TODAY SUPPORT TERRY BROWN ART FROM S. C. I. K. S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA AND MIKE POWERS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY OF INTERNET AND WE ALSO HAVE AMY GARDNER AN ATTORNEY FROM VENTURA COUNTY. AVAILABLE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK SO REMEMBER OWN. BUT VERY HARD TO SEE THAT WE HAVE- TERRY BRENNAN WILL BE TESTIFYING. IN IS A TRUE MICHAEL POWERS ALSO BECAUSE FIND. VERY PLEASE PROCEED A MUCH WOULD SELF IDENTIFY AND PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS TERRY BRENNAN ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID A GREAT JOB OF PRESENTING THE BILL IN THE NEED FOR THE BILL- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT REINTERPRETED SUMMER INTERFERES WITH THE CAPRA- BILL OF- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AFFECTED TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. IT'S MERELY A CLARIFICATION TO ENSURE THAT THIS BENEFIT CAN CONTINUE HAPPENING IT'S TREATED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER INCOME. AND PAID FOR IN THE SAME MANNER AS IT WOULD BE IF IT WERE. IN THE PAYCHECK DIRECTLY- FOR THAT REASON WE- ORIGIN I VOTE- THIS WAS ALSO NOT A SUBJECT TO LITIGATION. IN ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA MARIN TO CONSOLIDATE CASES SO THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WE NEED. TO CLARIFY THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THE MICHAEL POWERS. THE BILL IT'S ON THE TELECOM ONE IS THAT CORRECT. YES THERE ARE YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON MY POWERS OF THE TRUCK COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX A MEASURE THAT SEEKS TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF COMPENSATION OR NOBLE AND RETIREMENT LAW TO ENSURE THAT PENSION CALCULATIONS CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE THE COUNTY'S. FLEXIBLE BENEFIT ALLOWANCE. COULD PETITION IS CRITICALLY NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE COUNTING PLEASE ARE NOT UNDULY HARMED. TWENTY SIX A DESTINATION IS RISEN FROM THE SUPREME COURT ALAMEDA DECISION IN WHICH THE COURT RULED THAT PAPRIKA MODIFIED THE DEFINITION OF COMPETITION UNABLE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN PAY ITEMS THAT CONSTITUTED PENSION SPIKING. YOU KNOW PENSION SPIKING IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD TO INCLUDE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE TO INCREASE THEIR PENSION CALCUATIONS. VENTURA CASE HOWEVER THE COUNTY HAS ALWAYS INCLUDED THE FLEX BENEFIT BECAUSE IT IS A REGULAR SET AMOUNT PAID EVERY PAY PERIOD AND IS NOT SUBJECT. TO PENSIONS BIKING OR ANY OTHER MANIPULATION. AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF COMPETITION PRINTABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHILE PRESERVING AFTER A PENSION REFORM. IMPORTANTLY AB TWO EIGHT TWENTY SIX DOES NOT IMPACT ANY BENEFITS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED BY PEPPER. DON'T EVEN TRY HAS FULLY EMBRACED PENSION REFORM. THANKS TO OUR LABOR PARTNERS I GUESS YEAH YOU WE WERE IN FACT ONE OF THE FIRST AND YOU COUNTIES TO ACHIEVE FIFTY FIFTY NORMAL CAR SHARING WITH OUR LEGACY MEMBERS. OF PEPPER DID NOT REQUIRE IT WE ALSO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST FUNDED PENSION PLANS IN THE STATE AT NEARLY GENERAL AND SAFETY EMPLOYEES. FOR THIS BILL WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT ON US BECAUSE THE COST OF INCLUDING THE FLEX BENEFIT IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN OUR BUDGET PROJECTIONS. THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN SAVINGS FOR COUNTIES AND EXCLUDING THE BENEFIT WILL NO DOUBT RESULT IN COMPLEX AND COSTLY LABOR NEGOTIATIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT ON EMPLOYEES TOTAL COMPLICATION. THE COUNTY ARE LIKE IT'S EMPLOYERS HAVE PAID CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR THIS BENEFIT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. EXCLUSION OF THE BUT THE FLEX BENEFIT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EMPLOYEES AND YOU PRODUCE BUT THEIR LOWEST PAID WILL CONTINUE REDUCTION IN THEIR MONTHLY RETIREMENT INCOME AS MUCH AS TEN PERCENT. CANCER THE CREATED BY ALAMEDA HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR COUNTY EMPLOYEES OUR LABOR PARTNERS AND OUR RETIREMENT SYSTEM. AB TWENTY SIX PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED CLARITY FOR INTER COUNTY AND OUR EMPLOYEES AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. ARE YOU DOING THANK YOU THAT. THE DELETE.

IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NO LONGER JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST IF- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AS AN EMPLOYEE IF YOU WENT AND YOU SOLD A THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER YOU WOULD END UP IN JAIL. HOWEVER FOR DECADES NOW EMPLOYERS HAVE INTENTIONALLY STOLEN FROM WORKERS AND THE BEST THAT THEY GET IS A SLAP ON THE WRIST AND MAYBE A FINE FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THEN IF THEY ACTUALLY UNDO THEIR COMPANY CAN'T FIND THEM IN MOST OF THOSE GO UNPAID. SO WE WANT THE OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY WITH A NEW FOUND PROGRESSIVE. PROSECUTORS IN THE STATE TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER WAGE THAT IN A. M.

IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYEE IF YOU'RE STEALING FROM ONE ANOTHER. AND STEALING SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO SURVIVE IN. BUT FOOD ON THE TABLE IS PROBABLY THE WORST KIND OF THEFT ANYBODY COULD ENGAGE IN SOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CIRCLE- CENTER WEIRD WERE YOU LIVING IN THE HOUSE OF.

ENTRY WORKERS CORRECTLY WE NEED TO RETHINK THAT AND I HOPE THERE ARE A LOT OF- CORPORATE TOURNEY'S OUT THERE WHO ARE STARTING THEIR MEMOS ON WHAT WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU.

BUT AS THE I OR CHOI BOGUE. A TROUBLE GUY TO WRESTLE HI THE REST SO I LAYERED HI THERE I NEWMAN HI NEWMAN AYE. THE RAID ON THE UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR THE BILL WITHOUT THANK YOU. FORWARD INTO A BACK TO OUR- ORIGINAL THE REMAINING PHùORDER IS AB SEVEN NINETY FOUR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREWS HERE AND YOUR PERSONAL WELCOME AND- YOU'RE ALSO WELCOME 2% WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS AB SEVEN NINE FOUR IS A STEP IN LINKING SUBSIDIES FOR CLEAN VEHICLES TO LABOR AND JOB QUALITY STANDARDS STATE MONEY SPENT FOR CLEAN VEHICLES CAN DO MORE THAN REDUCE EMISSIONS IT CAN ALSO REDUCE THE ITS MISSION. OF WORKERS AND THE INDUSTRY IS TARGETED FOR SUBSIDIES AB SEVEN NINE FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY CARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF ZERO EMISSIONS- PORTRAYED IN SHORT HAUL TRUCKS ARE TIED TO LABOR STANDARDS SPECIFICALLY THAT TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT FLEET PURCHASERS NOT VIOLATE STATE LAWS. REGARDING THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO MAKE TO MEET AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS DEPENDS ON THE LARGE LARGELY IN- LARGE PART ON FLEET PURCHASERS TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. PARKED TRUCK DRIVERS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THAT SUPPLY CHAIN MOVING GOODS FROM THE SHIPS TO END UP IN WAREHOUSES AND BIG BOX STORES ACROSS THE STATE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ALSO PLAY A MAJOR SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND PRODUCE. TOXIC AIR POLLUTION THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SURROUNDING THE PORT THE MORE THOSE PORTS ACTUALLY AND WHERE THOSE TRUCKS TRAVEL TO- IN MY DISTRICT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE. POINT CHINA IS OVERLAID WITH SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY FOUR WE HAVE THE TWO FREEWAY THE ONE THIRTY FOUR THE FIVE THE SIXTY THE TEN THE ONE TEN THE TEN FREEWAY. MORE THAN SEVEN FREEWAYS THAT US AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THE ISSUE OF CLEAN AIR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT A MAJOR OBSTACLE OF MEETING CLIMATE GOALS ESTIMATES CLASSIFICATION APPORTER APART TRUCK DRIVERS A NUMBER OF STUDIES SHOW THAT BETWEEN 75285% OF PORT WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED. MEANING THEY ARE DEEMED DENIED MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME PAID SICK LEAVE AND REIMBURSEMENTS FOR FUEL AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE. MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS CANNOT AFFORD NEW CLEAN OR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. WHEN THE BURDEN OF THAT COST IS PURCHASED AND MAINTAIN AND MAINTAIN VEHICLES FALLS ON THEM. AND NOT ON THE TRUCKING COMPANIES. LABOR STANDARDS ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES CAN BEGIN TO SHIFT THE BUSINESS MODEL IN TRUCKING. FROM EXTREME WORKER EXPLOITATION. AND HEAVY EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION. TO BETTER JOB QUALITY FOR DRIVERS AND CLEANER AIR FOR COMMUNITIES. AB SEVEN NINE FOUR CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW. AND WILL PREVENT PUBLIC MONEY FROM SUPPORTING. MISS CLASSIFICATION LOW WAGE JOBS AND ILLEGAL LABOR PRACTICES. AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT OF TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ECONOMY CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD TO FAIL ON COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT CLIMATE JOBS ARE GOOD JOBS. TO GROW OUR ECONOMY AND BENEFIT WORKERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT WE CAN DO BOTH. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS MATTER TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SEVEN NINE FOR SEVERAL BLOCKS REPRESENTING THE TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION. AND SOME APPEL WITH THE CAL A CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER WITH THE BLUE GREEN ALLIANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THE IN THE WILL TURN TO LEAD SUPPORT WHEN THE SERVER FOX'S HERE IN PERSON AND THEN MAY PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE ARE FLOCKS REPRESENTING THE TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION AT CO SPONSOR AND PROUD TO BE PART OF A COALITION OF LABOR COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BEAR THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF GHG EMISSIONS AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND KNOW WHERE IS THAT MORE CLEAR THAN AT THE PORTS AND IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID YOU HAVE THESE HEAVY DUTY DRAYAGE AND SHORT HAUL TRUCKS THAT ARE MOVING GOODS ALL OVER THE PORT THERE HEAVY HIGH EMITTER SO HEAVY DUTY HIGH EMITTERS THEY'RE GETTING ON THESE FREEWAYS AND THEN THEY'RE GOING OUT TO DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES IN THE INLAND. BETTER THAN SENDING GOODS THROUGH AMAZON GOING TO BIG BOX STORES. AND THE COMMUNITIES ALONG THIS ROUTE ARE THE ONES WHO SUFFER WHO ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE HIGHER ASTHMA RATES HIGHER RISK OF CANCER AND- MORE AIR POLLUTION IN THE AIR AND THEN IN THE PORTS. MISCLASSIFIED PORT TRUCK DRIVERS ALSO SUFFER. EIGHT THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT MISCLASSIFIED TRUCK DRIVERS ONES WHO ARE NOT GETTING MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME IN THE RIGHTS OF BEING AN EMPLOYEE I EAT. EARN LESS THAN DIRECTLY EMPLOYED TRUCK DRIVERS. AND YET THEY HAVE HIGHER CAPITAL COSTS AND ARE EXPECTED TO BUY THEIR OWN ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD. SO THAT IS AN OBSTACLE TO MEETING OUR STATE CLIMATE GOALS. AB SEVEN SEVEN NINETY FOUR IS A STEP FORWARD IN THAT IT SAYS. BEFORE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET A SUBSIDY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE NOT MISS CLASS THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVE VIOLATIONS OF LAW RELATED TO MISS CLASSIFICATION. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL AND IT REALLY IS TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYERS AND CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR TRUCKING COMPANIES TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR LAW. AND WITH CLINICAL SO WE ARE DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY PRO IF YOU WERE ON THE TELECONFERENCE ON YOU WE PROCEED KNACKS.
