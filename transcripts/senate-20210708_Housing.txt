OKAY I AM NEW TO CHEERING IN THIS ROOM SO I WAS LOOKING EVERYWHERE BUT WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOME REMEMBER- IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL THIS IS AB FORTINO ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MEMBERS IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT A POLICY THAT IMPACTS SO MANY OF OUR GOALS WE ALL HAVE A GOAL OF SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY NEED TO OPERATE. CHANGE USES. FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR TENANTS WITHOUT. UNDUE INTERFERENCE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE ALL HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE GOAL OF GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS CREATING. SOME DENSER MORE WALKABLE BIKEABLE CITY CENTERS PARTICULARLY NEAR TRANSIT. WHICH AS A STATE WE HAVE MADE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE TRANSIT WORK BETTER BY TRYING TO ATTRACT MORE HOUSING AND MORE BUSINESSES NEAR THOSE VERY SAME HIGH QUALITY TRAIN STOPS. AND HIGH QUALITY BUS STOPS. WE TALK PARTICULARLY ABOUT HOUSING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING MORE HOUSING NOT JUST HOUSING FOR. THE WEALTHY THE HOUSING FOR. THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED IN FOR THE MISSING MIDDLE. ABOUT FINDING WAYS OF BRINGING BUILDING COSTS DOWN NOW A LOT OF THE BUILDING COST THAT WE HAVE HAVE TO DO WITH THINGS THAT WE WANT BUILDERS TO SPEND MONEY ON. LIKE EARTHQUAKE SAFETY LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL. A STANDARDS IN BUILDINGS AND YET THERE ARE STILL SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT MOST OF OUR CITIES HAVE THAT ADD TREMENDOUS COST TO THE COST OF HOUSING. BUT ENDS UP GETTING SPREAD DIRECTLY BACK TO TENANTS KEEPING THAT HOUSING COSTS HI. NO APARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA GENERALLY HAVE TO INCLUDE ONE OR TWO OR EVEN MORE SPACES PER UNIT. AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES OFTEN HAVE TO PROVIDE ONE SPACE FOR EVERY ONE TO TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THAT BUILDING MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE AND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AT THAT PARTICULAR TENANT. THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATES IS OFTEN IMPOSED IN THE AREAS EVEN THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TO OUR HIGHEST QUALITY TRANSIT. THIS CREATES A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENTICED TO DRIVE RATHER THAN USE THAT VERY TRANSIT WE'RE JOINED IN PARKING LOTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO WALK AND BIKE PLEASANTLY AROUND THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHICH OF COURSE CONTINUES TO INVITE MORE MORE CONGESTION RIGHT INTO THOSE VERY SAME TRANSIT ADJACENT AREAS. MANDATORY PARKING REQUIREMENTS ALSO WORSEN CALIFORNIA'S SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS BY RAISING THE COST OF HOUSING PRODUCTION. ON AVERAGE A GARAGE COSTS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE TO BUILD WHICH IS PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE RENTING. THOSE UNITS. AND ONSITE SIDE PARKING OFTEN TAKES UP SPACE THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR MORE UNITS. NOWWHAT HAPPENS IF IN THOSE AREAS YOU WILL ALLOW THE MARKET TO DECIDE HOW MUCH PARKING THEY NEED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT. C. N. B. A. GO ELIMINATED MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE CITY SAW MORE THAN FOUR TIMES INCREASE FOUR TIMES INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WERE CREATED. WE CANNOT CONCLUDE THAT A 100% OF THE ELIMINATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THIS INCREASE IN PRODUCTION BUT WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT IT DID NOT HURT THE DENSITY BONUS PRODUCTION. AB FORTINO ONE DOES NOT PROHIBIT ANYONE FROM ADDING PARKING IT SIMPLY ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO RIGHT SIZE PARKING FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENTS. AND IN BUFFALO NEW YORK WHICH ELIMINATED PARKING REQUIREMENTS CITY WIDE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHAT THEY SAW WAS THAT DEVELOPERS WHO WERE DOING PARTICULARLY MIXED USE HOUSING. WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE PARKING THAT THEY WERE SHARED BETWEEN THOSE UNITS MAYBE THEY CREATED TANDEM PARKING STUDENT PARKING WAS ADDING ONE UNIT ONE PARKING SPACE INSTEAD OF TWO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY KNEW THE STUDENTS NEEDED. WE TOOK A MOMENT IN GOVERNMENT FINANCE THAT NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL SO THAT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES. IT'S THE BUSTED LINES ARE NOT AFFECTED AND THAT NEAR RAIL IT'S ONLY A QUARTER MILE AS OPPOSED TO HALF A MILE LIKE IN THE URBAN AREAS. WE THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES A CONTINUED PARKING ACCESS FOR DISABLED. RESIDENTS AND FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING. EIGHTY FORTY NO ONE IS ALSO THE REAR BILL THAT BRINGS MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. MANY OF MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHO SEES THE IMPORTANCE FOR RESTAURANTS FOR BUILDERS. AND ALSO OF COURSE- HOUSING ADVOCATES LIKE CALIFORNIA YIMBY AND SPURRED ABUNDANT HOUSING LA WHO ARE SPONSORS. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIPHATE BY BY C. B. I. A.

GOOD MORNING OR AFTERNOON SHARE NUMBERS THE BIGGEST DEAL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED YOU AB FOURTEEN ZERO ONE. WESTERN CENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREES AND SUPPORTS THE OFFICE INTENDED GOAL TO REMOVE EXCESSIVE PARKINGREQUIREMENTS AND ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES LAST JULY AND HUNGRY HOW CAPTIVATING CARD UNFORTUNATELY AT FOURTEEN NO ONE CURRENTLY DOES NOT STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN A POLICY OBJECTIVE AND I THINK EQUALLY CRITICAL CALL. CREEPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER W SHOULD ELIMINATE PARKING REQUIREMENTS WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ELIMINATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE DONE IN COORDINATION WITH MIXED INCOME AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT THAT. FRAMEWORK OR DEALINGS FOR LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND ADS EIGHTY FORTY ONE IS A CURRENT FORM OR MORE SIMPLY IT'S A QUESTION OF pPARKING REQUIREMENTS THE PORTEND INCLUSIONARY DEVELOPMENT OR LESS LESS THAN EXCLUSIONARY DEVELOPMENT. I THINK PARKING REDUCTIONS WITH THE DENSITY BONUS FRAMEWORK WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO CAPTURE THE VALUE OF ANY BENEFIT CONVEYED YOU THAT'S PRETTY AFFORDABLE UNITS AND ACHIEVE MORE DANCING YOUR TRANSIT MEANING MORE HOUSING UNITS ACROSS. WE KNOW THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR TRANSIT UTILIZE THAT TRANSIT FAR HIGHER RATES AND HIGHER INCOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR TRANSIT MAXIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT WE SHOULD ALL WHO DRIVE TO MAXIMIZE THE PORTABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES NEAR TRANSIT FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT. IN ADDITION THE CLINICAL REQUIRED REPLACEMENT OF ANY. TOMATO PORTABLE ARIGHT HE TOLD. THE REMOVING TO DO IT I THINK I TRACK. AND FURTHER IMPACT ON DECREASING THE SUPPLY. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRANSIT. MAINTAINING THE REPLACE BENEFITS CRITICAL AND BE GOOD FOR THE PREFERRED QUALITY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OFFICE WITH HIM DRINKING. BY WHICH THE CAN CREATE THE PART OF THE- THEY WOULD. OR WHERE THE PROJECT INCLUDES YOU KNOW. GIVEN OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FOREGO ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BRING NEW PROJECTS FOR ABOUT HOW THE FRAMEWORK WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE ANY AFFORDABILITY ON THE TABLE WE SHOULD USE THE QUALITY OPTION I REVIEWED THE PARKING AND INCREASE THE PORTABILITY TOGETHER. THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH TO MAXIMIZING THE KIND OF BENEFITS OF THAT BATTLE EQUITABLE HOUSING POLICY IS THE KIND OF QUALITY WE CAN CONFIRM THE NUMBER FREEMAN OR STAFF AS. WELL AS THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OF MUDDY MONCHI APPEAR AVAILABLE YOU MAY TESTIFY AT THIS TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IT MIGHT BE MY G.

WILD THING INSTEAD LIKE BOEING CONTENT- TRANSIT RECOUPING CORE LOWER CONSTRUCTION COSTS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY THINK THAT A MEDICALLY TRICKLE DOWN TO RENT. A PORTABLE TEND TO ACTUALLY DEPEND ON TRAFFIC POPULATION IN LA- WITH THE MEDIAN INCOME OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IN ITS CURRENT FORM EIGHTY FORTINO ONE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY PLAN FOR PORTABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION OPERATIONS MADE SENSE FIGHTING WITH THE PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE LIMITING PARKING PERMITS WILL GO HAND IN HAND CREATING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING VALLEY TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM CAN ACTUALLY TRAVEL COMMUNITY DRIEN HOUSING PROGRAM TO REDUCE PARKING PERMIT. THE GREAT THOUSANDS OF UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO ARE YOU GUYS BUILD BACK IN A FEW OF THE PROGRAM WE JUST RELEASED AN ALBUM.

OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR WILL COME BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NOW UNNECESSARY YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR ANYONE WANTS TO BE RECOGNIZED GENERALLY- WE'LL START WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND THEN SENATOR CAFIERO. BY YOU- CHAIR. I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- HEY YOU KNOW THESE DEBATES. WE'RE FACED IT CONTINUOUSLY WITH AND SOME LEVEL OF THE OPPOSITION IS OPPOSING BECAUSE THEY USE THE PARKING REQUIREMENT TO TRY TO- EXTRACTED THE BENEFITS. BUT I FEEL AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE COST OF REQUIRING PARKING ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT JUSTIFIES THE MIND TO RESERVE- ARE IT'S SO HARD IT IS SO EXPENSIVE NOW TO CONSTRUCT HOUSING THAT WE WOULD ADD THAT REQUIREMENT AND ADD THAT COST IN TIMES WHERE IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND THAT WE WOULD ALLOW PARKING TO BECOME. MORE IMPORTANT IN HOUSING WHEN WE ARE IN THE TYPE OF CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN KIND OF FORCED ME RIGHT NOW IN OAKLAND WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT THERE IS A LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECT. THAT HAS A NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE SPECIFIC FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT BEEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESS THAT IS BEING. HELD BACK BY THE PARKING MANDATES AND- MOST OF THE UNITS ARE WOULD BE FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD CARS IN THE FIRST PLACE- ANYWAY SO I AM VERY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER COPIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR SHE TOOK THE TIME TO HAVE A FAIRLY LENGTHY CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT THE BILL- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH THE DETAILS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BUT I BUT HERE'S HERE'S MY CONCERN IS THAT- THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS REALLY WELL DONE. GIVES EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE. EVERY EXAMPLE OF WHICH IS A HEAVILY URBANIZED AREA. TALK ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO TALK ABOUT SAN DIEGO- TALK ABOUT LOS ANGELES. AND MY CONCERN REPRESENTING A- IT WOULD BE A VERY RURAL. PART OF THE STATE IS THAT- OUR ISSUES IS THAT WE DESPERATELY WANT THE EXTENSION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'VE LONG THOUGHT THAT OUR OVER RELIANCE ON ACHIEVING CLIMATE CHANGE BY MOVING FROM- FOSSIL FUEL VIA VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES MISSES THE POINT WHICH IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES PERIOD. AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS BY EXTENDING OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE REALLY WOULD GET OUT OF THEIR VEHICLE AND IF THERE WAS AN OPTION AND SO I WANT I THE PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE DESPITE THE FACT AND I AND I WANT TO. RECOGNIZE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE GOOD FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES THIS FRANKLY IS NOT GOING TO APPLY. EXCEPT FOR IN VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND TO TRAIN STATIONS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SETS UP. IT SETS THE TRAIN IN MOTION IF YOU WILL- I GET CONCERNED ABOUT EXTENDING IT BEYOND THAT BECAUSE- IN MY COMMUNITIES THEY DESPERATELY WANT HOUSING. AND BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT IT FITS IN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THERE IS THERE ARE ENOUGH PARKING SPACES- IT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THE WORDS IN MY IN MY REGION PEOPLE ARE NOT CONCERNED. ABOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES THEY WANT MORE BECAUSE OF SUCH OF THE SOME OF THIS OVER CROWDED. HOUSING SITUATION SO IN ANY CASE- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK SHE'S DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THIS- I WOULD HAVE FELT BETTER IF IT'D JUST EXCLUDED RURAL AREAS COMPLETELY pAT- WHAT THIS IS DONE FOR THE URBAN AREAS BUT- BUT GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS. LIMITATIONS ON EXACTLY WHERE IT APPLIES I'M I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT TODAY AND RESERVE JUDGMENT ON. WHEN IT HITS THE FLOOR IF IT GETS THAT FAR. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AN ARRANGEMENT. THANK YOU- AND I WANT TO THANK THE ESTIMATE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I SERVED ON A STOCKTON IN STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND I REPRESENT THE MIDTOWN DOWNTOWN AREA OF STOCKTON AND IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING TRYING TO GET HOUSING I DEVELOPED IN OUR DOWNTOWN AND IN IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS AND OFTENTIMES HELD UP BECAUSE OF PARKING ISSUES- BUT I ALSO I ALSO WANT TO GIVE CREDENCE TO WHAT THE SENATOR FROM SALINAS IS SAYING IS THAT THE ELECTRIC CARS ARE NOT THE ANSWER BUT WE NEED BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND I ONLY. ASPIRE TO THE DAY. WHEN WE'LL GET OUR VALLEY LINK TRAIN CONNECTED AND MAYBE BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING LIKE THIS MORE BUT- I SUPPORT THIS BILL I DO NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE. ELEVATING PARKING OVER HOUSING- AND AT THE SAME TIME IN AREAS THAT HAVE LESS. A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE GONNA HAVE MORE VEHICLES BUT OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO. DEVELOP THIS KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO. I AM ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR IT WHEN THE TIME COMES. THE SENATOR OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED ON THE COMMITTEE. OF C. NONE- IT'LL BE JUST AS- MAKE A QUICK COMMENT BEFORE- POLONY OFTEN UP TO CLOTHES- AN ASSOCIATE WITH A SOCIALLY MY COMMENTS JUST GENERALLY- WITH THOSE OF SENATOR CAFIERO- IN EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY IN IN IN MOST PARTS- I DO WANT TO- INDICATOR ALSO HAD- HERO A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR AND EXPECT TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE AT SOME POINT- BUT I WILL SUPPORT THE BUILDING OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I DO THINK MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE- NOT ONLY ALONG THE LINES OF- SENATOR. KABIR WAS COMMENTS IN TERMS OF NON URBAN AREAS PUT IT IN A HIGHLY IMPACTED IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN IN URBAN AREAS LIKE WE HAVE ANY SENTENCING AROUND OUR MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS SO I'D I DON'T THINK THE BILL IS FAR OFF IN THAT REGARD BUT I WOULD HOPE- THEY'LL BE SOME CONTINUED- THOUGHTFULNESS IN TERMS OF HOW TO PROCEED ON THAT SAID- I JUST WANNA GET MY COMMENTS ON THE RECORD- I THANK YOU FOR- ONLY WORK ON THE BILL THE SOME REMEMBER IN A GIVEN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND THANKS EVERYBODY FOR YOUR REALLY WELL THOUGHT OUT THEM COMMENTS- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TODAY AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IN OUR RURAL AREAS WHEN IT COMES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PROBLEMS WITH PARKING THE SOLUTION IS BETTER TRANSIT IT'S US INVESTING AS A STATE IN TRANSIT AND DE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE TAKE UP MUCH NEEDED LAND FOR PARKS NEEDED LAND FOR BUSINESSES CERTAINLY NEEDED LAND FOR HOUSING. SO CONTINUING MISSILE CONTINUING A SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS LEAD TO BAD MOBILITY TRAFFIC CONGESTION AIR POLLUTION AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT THE ANSWER THE ANSWER IS TO SHIFT TO OUR FOCUS ON A TRANSIT AND. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED A AS IS PRESS FOR CHARACTER WITH YOU ALL OF THE ON THAT THAT'S WHY I'M THERE. THAT'S THE GOAL ARE YOU SAY IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE. I UNDER THE CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WE HAVE DATA WE HAVE ACTUAL DATA AND ACTUAL LIVING PROOF. FIRST OF ALL WHEN SAN DIEGO DID EXACTLY THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION WENT UP FOUR TIMES. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WELL THEY MENTION VALUE CAPTURE THERE IS NO VALUE CAPTURE REDUCING PARKING THAT'S WHY MERCURY DEVELOPERS ARE STILL BUILDING WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF PARKING EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO. WHAT IT DOES DO IS ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE WANTING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR FOR MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS AND PASS THAT ALONG TO PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO DO OTHER CREATIVE THINGS LIKE TANDEM PARKING. OFFERING SOME UNITS WITH LESS PARKING. AND SO WE KNOW THAT JUST FROM DATA THAT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TYPE OF IMPACT THAT THEY'RE AFRAID THAT WE'LL HAVE. SECONDLY THEY SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING THAT THEY DON'T LIKE ALL THE PARKING BECAUSE OF THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES THE POLLUTION PROBLEMS THE CONGESTION PROBLEMS. TO SORT OF MAINTAIN THAT IN ORDER TO BARGAIN IT BACK TO TRY TO BARGAIN A BATH. REALLY JUST SEEMS LIKE THE WRONG TOPIC YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S CAUSING HARM DON'T USE THAT AS YOUR BARGAININ CHIP- IT'S JUST THE WRONG WAY TO DO IT. REMOVE THAT INSTANT THAT DISINCENTIVE. CREATING POLLUTION EVERY REQUIREMENTS IF YOU LIKE BUT LET'S CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF BUILDING HOUSING THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL DO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE ICE OF THE ITEMS TODAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. AND JUST WANT CONFIRM. SKINNER HAS MADE THE MOTION. TO MOVE THE BILL. WITHOUT US CONSULTANT CULTURAL PLEASE. THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL FORTINO ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CENTER COURTESY HI CORTESE I'D BATES.

WELCOME AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND SENATORS IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE PRESENTING HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL CHAMBER I'M HERE TO PRESENT A B. THREE SIX TWO MY CHILD CARE OPERATORS ACCOUNTABILITY BILL. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THE BILL. AB THREE SIX TWO ENSURES MINIMUM HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS ARE FOLLOWED BY SHELTER OPERATORS AND THAT ALL SHELTER RESIDENTS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. A YEAR LONG. INVESTIGATION BY THE AMERICANS CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOUND SEVERE DEFICITS AMONG VARIOUS EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY. WITH REPORTS OF ALLEGED SEXUAL ABUSE OVERCROWDING UNHEALTHY CONDITIONS AND GO ACTIVE RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND MENTAL ILLNESSES. THIS INVESTIGATION ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE UNSANITARY CONDITIONS IN THE SHELTERS INCLUDING WIDESPREAD ROAD AND BEDBUG INFESTATIONS EXTREME TEMPERATURES BROKEN SHOWERS AND TOILETS. THE NEED FOR ENFORCEABLE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY SANT STANDARDS FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS IS URGENT. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE VULNERABILITY OF HOMELESS SHELTER RESIDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS. EVEN THOUGH HELP SHELTERS WERE NEVER INTENDED TO SERVE AS A LONG TERM HOUSING THE REALITY IS AND TELL THE HOUSING CRISIS IS ADDRESS MANY OF THE SHELTERS WERE SET OR- WILL SERVE AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE FOR UNSHELTERED CALIFORNIANS. AS OUR STATE CONTINUES TO FACE A GROWING HOMELESS CRISIS THIS BILL IS THE FIRST STEP IN CORRECTING SOME OF THE ISSUES AT THE SHELTERS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS EVE GARO WITH. ACLU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M ASSUMING MEMBER IN. WE WILL NOW GO TO- GIRL YOUR LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE ACLU OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORT. TO END THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA MUST EXPAND ACCESS TO PERMANENT SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ALL WHO NEED IT IN THE MEANTIME WE MUST ENSURE THAT HOMELESS SHELTERS WHICH ARE OFTEN THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOUSE THESE ARE SAFE PLACES TO LIVE. MY YEARLONG INVESTIGATION OF SEVERAL HOMELESS SHELTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY FOUND THAT SHELTERS INSTEAD OFTEN EXPOSED RESIDENTS TO CONDITIONS IN FLAGRANT DISREGARD OF THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING ONE SHELTER I INVESTIGATED WITHIN AN OPEN AIR CONVERTED BUS TERMINAL PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES EXPOSED TO WIND AND RAIN THERE WAS NO TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND RESIDENTS SUFFERED FROM EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT AND COLD SHOWERS OFTEN RAN COLD LEECH BLACKWATER AND WE'RE SOMETIMES BROKEN FOR WEEKS. WERE OFTEN BROKEN AN OVERFLOWING WITH HUMAN WASTE INFESTATIONS OF MAGGOT BERMAN AND INFLEXIBLE COMMON MY INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH OTHER EXPOSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INDICATE THAT UNSAFE AND UNSANITARY SHELTER CONDITIONS. CAN AND DO HAPPEN EVERYWHERE. WHAT OVERSIGHT IN FOURTH OF. TO HELP IN SAFETY IS THE TO THESE PROBLEMS. EXISTING LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE HOMELESS SHELTERS TO BE INSPECTED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT RESIDENTS OF A SHELTER ARE UNLIKELY TO LODGE COMPLAINTS DUE TO FEARS OF BEING AFFECTED FROM THE SHELTER. IN RETALIATION FOR REPORTING. EIGHTY THREE SIXTY TWO WOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CONDUCT AT LEAST ONE INSPECTION OF EACH HOMELESS SHELTER IN ITS JURISDICTION PER YEAR. AND RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT. OWNERS OR OPERATORS THAT REPEATEDLY VIOLATE EXISTING STANDARDS MAY BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE FOR STATE FUNDING ADDITIONALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT. TO H. C. D. IDENTIFYING VIOLATIONS OF THE STATE HOUSING LAW WHICH MAY BE USED TO BE A SHELTER OPERATOR IN ELIGIBLE FOR STATE FUNDING. OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS DESERVE BETTER WITHOUT I ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT. EIGHTY THREE SIXTY TWO THANK YOU. IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TOES- WE WILL ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE.

SO IF THERE IF THERE IS A VIOLATION NOTIFIED ENOUGH AND IN ORDER TO- TO FIX IT. IS THERE ANY I MEAN IS IT JUST BASICALLY WITH UP WITH THE FUNDS AT THE SHELTER ALREADY HAS IS IT IS THE LOCAL. JURISDICTION BUT THEY YOU KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE AT ALL RESPONSIBLE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DO HAVE TO ACTUALLY SHUT IT DOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN A SHELTER. OR WILL THERE BE. APT TO COME ON GOING RELATIONSHIP I GUESS BETWEEN THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN THAT. AND THAT THE HOMELESS SHELTER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION VERY GOOD- I CERTAINLY. IS NOT INTENDING WITH THIS BILL TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OPERATE SHELTERS WERE MORE EXPENSIVE. OUR INTENT IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT MINIMUM STANDARDS OR- AND AS FAR AS- FIXING WHETHER IT BE TOILET- SHELLED. SHOWERS THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ALL UNDER THE PROVIDERS UMBRELLA MEANING THEY SHOULD ALREADY BE ADDRESSING MAINTENANCE FOR THE SHELTERS AS AN ONGOING. PROCESS HI AS PEOPLE ARE BEING HOUSED THERE BUT WE CERTAINLY WILL MAKE SURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING TO ADDRESS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THOSE THAT ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED IN THIS SPACE THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO REALIZE. THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE IT DOES NOT GIVE US THE- EXCUSE TO SAY WELL WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT YOU AGREE WITH THAT I'VE USE YOU WORK IN THE CITY THE SPACE AS WELL. THANK YOU ANYTHING ELSE IN REGARDS.

IN FORCE SOME OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WE WANT TO PUT FORWARD. WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH AN INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE POPULATION AT THE SAME TIME. AND A LACK OF. AVAILABLE PLACES TO PUT PEOPLE.

AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALL THE- CENTERS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A. B. SIX ZERO TWO ESTABLISHES TRANSPORTATION OR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS FOR THE NEXUS STUDIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PREPARE WHEN IMPOSING DEVELOPMENT FEES OR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. THESE INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STATE THEIR EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE. PROVIDED CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN FOR PROPOSED EXPENDITURES AND COMPLY WITH PUBLIC NOTICE AND OPENING THE OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL WILL TIE FEES MORE CLOSELY TO THE ACTUAL IMPACTS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT BY REQUIRING THAT FEES BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF A PROPOSED UNIT OR UNITS. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF THIS POLICY IS THAT DEVELOPERS WILL BE GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO SUB DIVIDE PROJECTS INTO SMALLER MORE NATURALLY AFFORDABLE UNITS. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO DEVELOP A TEMPLATE FOR NEXUS STUDIES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY CHOOSE TO USE. THAT MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE WAY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS POSTER IMPACT FEES ONLINE. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE COMMON SENSE REFORMS WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENCY CLARITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE WAY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DETERMINE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IN ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS OR TWO WITNESSES I. THREW THE CHAIR WOULD HAVE SELF INTRODUCE.

ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO THINGS THAT ARE ARE ARE NEEDED ARE FAIRLY DECIDED ON BY TRAIN FOR OF PUBLIC ART THAT. AND ARE PROPORTIONAL THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE HOUSE. THE TWO OF THE TEACHERS THAT FAILED BUT I THINK WE'RE MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT. THAT AT THE RATE THAT AND I DID THAT TOUCHED ON ARE THE ARE THE PIECES OUT TRYING. TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THE BILL WOULD SAY THAT HE'S IDENTIFIED. I THINK THE NEXT BODY PART THAT. ONLY SUPPORT OF PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPITAL PLAN BUT THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS WILL BE GOVERNMENTS WILL ADOPT.

TO HELP US DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND THE BENEFIT OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THEY PROVIDE A HOUSING UNIT IS THAT FOR MANY STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE- THEY CAN. GET THE RENTAL INCOME FROM THE S. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS FOR VARIETY OF REASONS TO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING FINANCING TO BUILD SUCH UNITS AND THIS BABY FIVE SIX ONE REQUIRES THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO HELP. TO DEVELOP A HELP HOMEOWNERS IN NEW HOUSING PROGRAM BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO ASSIST HOMEOWNERS WITH A POIGNANCY. IT ALSO ADDS GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION INCLUDING SETTING ASIDE A PORTION OF THE ASSISTANCE. FOR FOLKS THAT ARE AT OR BELOW A 100% A. M. Y.

FIVE SIXTY ONE RECOGNIZE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE FIRST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT. MY OFFICES HAD DISCUSSIONS FOR PROBABLY TWO YEARS WITH THE HOUSING A CALIFORNIA HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THE SICK CONCERNS ON FINANCING- WITH THEIR CREDIT RATING AND WITH THEIR FRIENDS FREDDIE MAC AND FANNIE MAE WILL ALLOW- LOANS TO GO THROUGH SO I APPRECIATE THE PARTS OF THE- BILL THAT REQUIRED THE TREASURY TO CONSULT WITH. AND T. S. H. C. D. N. THE CALIFORNIA FINANCE FINANCING HOUSING FINANCING AGENCY EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCING AGENCY SHALL NOT BE AFFILIATED WITH THIS. SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE TICKET THERE MY QUESTION IS WELL IT'S CALLED A HELP HOMEOWNERS ADD NEW HOUSING PROGRAM- I WAS WONDERING IF THE PRESENTER. KNEW THAT IF. RE HAVE A D. USE THAT HAVE BEEN THERE'S BEEN A DETERMINATION BY THE LOCAL. AUTHORITIES THAT IT'S NOT SAFE AND HABITABLE SO IT'S KNOCKED OUT OF THE HOUSING IF THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR ONE OF THESE LOANS TO BRING. IN MY UNDERSTANDING ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS BACK ON TO THE MARKET IF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN PUMPED OUT OF FOR THE BOOTLEG UNITS. THE SOONER SCHOONER DID YOU WANT TO ATTEMPT IT RESPONDED TO A QUESTION OR- A DEFERRED TO THE LEAD WITNESS PERHAPS. RESPOND IN THAT TOWN. IN MY READ OF THE TEXT OF THE BILL. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN EXCLUSION FOR THAT HOWEVER IT IS NOT EXPLICITLY INCLUDED SO I THINK THAT MIGHT END UP BEING. PART OF A. WHETHER THE TREASURER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM- PURSUES IT. THE TITLE NEW HOUSING IS OF COURSE ONLY A TITLE IN ISN'T NECESSARILY SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATUTE SO- MY ANSWER IS THAT HI I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE GRAY AREAS WHERE IT DOES NOT. EXPLICITLY INCLUDE IT BUT IT DOES NOT EXCLUDE ARMED AND I CERTAINLY SEE THE POINT OF THE- OF SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN ASKING THE QUESTION BECAUSE- PRIOR TO HIS GOOD WORK AND OTHERS IN IN. GETTING EIGHTY USE TO BE ACCEPTED BY OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ALLOWED. THERE WERE ISSUES THEY JUST HOWEVER WERE ILLEGAL SO THEY WERE ILLEGAL GRANNY FLATS. AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE CAN TO SUPPORT TRYING TO GET THOSE TO MEET CODE AND BE LEGAL SO THEY CAN BE GOOD HOUSING UNITS SO I APPRECIATE THE INTENT. THOUGH I THINK SOME OF THAT WILL HAVE TO BE IN INTERACTIONS WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICES THEY DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM AND OF COURSE THERE IT'S GIVEN DEPENDING ON HOW THE FINANCING IS DEVELOPED. WHETHER THAT FINANCING YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE IF IT AGAIN THERE'S FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC ISSUES THERE'S VARIOUS ISSUE SO ALL OF THOSE WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT BUT I CAN CERTAINLY SEE A VALUE TO WHAT. SENATOR Y. SKI RACE AND MISTER CHAIR AT THE HI I WOULD JUST MAKE THE DISTINCTION IF YOU HAVE AN EXISTING EIGHTY YOU AND IT'S AND IT MEETS ALL THE SAFETY. A SAFETY AND HEALTHY- REQUIREMENTS. AND YOU WANT TO. OUR MONEY TO THIS IT UP WITH THE PAINTED I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE PART OF THIS PROGRAM THAT'S YOUR OWN VEHICLE JUST LIKE YOU WANT TO PAINT YOUR HOUSE BUT IF YOU IF THERE'S BEEN A DETERMINATION. THAT IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NO LONGER CO HABIT OF NORTH THEN THEY WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT THE TREASURE AND THE FOLKS THAT ARE. TRYING TO INTERPRET THIS WOULD SAY pHOUSING AS HE COUNTS AS WE COUNT FOR RENO OR WITH OTHER PURPOSES- IF. THEY NEED A MOTION I WILL MAKE IT. ORIGINAL SAUCE HE DULY NOTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND- WILL COME BACK TO YOU- TO FORMALIZE THE MOTION AFTER. BUT WE CHECK TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED- TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY ONE. THIS IS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME- SCENE NINE CENTER SCANNER YOU MAY CLOSE. I N. I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO SENATOR CASKEY IS BEING THE- FIRST LEGISLATOR TO REALLY PUSH THIS- THIS- GREEN LIGHTING OF USE AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION BUT AS WE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY IT HAS BEEN AMAZING SUCCESS STORY. WE HAVE ADDED A GREAT DEAL OF HOUSING UNITS AND WHAT I WOULD NOTE THE- THAT MIGHT LEAD LEAD WITNESS DID NOT INDICATE THAT THAT TURNER STUDY POINTED OUT SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RAISE ABOUT EIGHTY USES WELL YOU KNOW IF THEIR CHEST STUDIOS OR WHATEVER. ARE THEY REALLY ASSISTING US TO GET FAMILY HOUSING BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE TURNER STUDY SHOWED IS THAT LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS. THE EIGHTY USE THAT THEY PROVIDE TEND TO BE FAMILY UNITS AND THEY TEND TO BE AT A AT A RENTED AT AFFORDABLE RATES SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN ASSIST A LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS BE ABLE TO. ACHIEVE AN EIGHTY YOU THEN WE ARE ADDING FAMILY HOUSING UNITS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS FINANCING PROGRAM REALLY WOULD DO. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. FOUR TAKE THE SENATORS- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE CASKET ON EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY ONE TURN THE CONSOLE FOR THE ROLL CALL. THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIXTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TANG THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR CORTEZ C. CORTEZ HE I'D BATES.

THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN VERSION. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO CONSIDER INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SPACES AT EXISTING MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS TO TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE AVAILABLE PARKING AT THE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS YOUR PART OF THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP BUILDING STANDARDS FOR INSTALLATION. FOR FUTURE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PARKING SPACES FOR EXISTING NON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL COMBUSTION POWERED VEHICLES ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S CARBON FOOTPRINT. GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PHASE OUT THIS. OF NEW COMBAT ENGINE VEHICLES TWENTY FIVE. TO COM THIS GOAL THE CAL ENERGY COMMISSION HAS ASKED ME THAT HOW WILL NEED. ONE POINT FIVE NO YOU CHARGE. THIS DR TRANSITION EV'S IN THE COMING DECADES. REQUIRING EEVEE READY PARKING SPACES AT MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN CONSIDERING THE ADDITIONAL TV CHARGING. WHEN AN EXISTING BUILDING REQUIRES A BUILDING OR ELECTRICAL PERMIT FOR CONSTRUCTION. OR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE METHODS TO FACILITATE BROAD DEPLOYMENT. OF EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THIS MEASURE IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE TO ENSURE. THE EQUITABLE AND SWIFT DEVELOPMENT. APARTMENT DEPLOYMENT OF EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN BOTH MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARD AN ALL EASY FUTURE EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWING NUMBER OF TV'S ON OUR STREETS.

HELLO DC IS THE NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION AND LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENT OF ALL FORMS OF ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION. AND OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE UTILITIES AUTOMAKERS AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING PROVIDERS. WE SUPPORT EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WHICH PROVIDES THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENT BUILDING STANDARDS THAT FACILITATE EASY CHARGING AT EXISTING NON RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. AND WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO CONSIDER A MINIMUM TARGET OF EXISTING MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS OR ANY DESIRE TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING- EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WILL HELP REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO GREATER AND MORE EQUITABLE ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE AUTHOR MENTIONED GOVERNOR SIMS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE STATE HAS ADOPTED SOME VERY AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES INCLUDING A FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY. TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT SCALE UP OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESSED A KEY BARRIER TO CHARGING ACCESS EXISTING. M. U. D. AND R. INTRODUCTION SOMEONE ON. AT THE AT A WORKSHOP IN FEBRUARY POSTED BY- THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- STAFF STATED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A THE NECESSARY STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ADOPT STANDARDS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS HOWEVER.

WE LIKE TO TAKE A FAMILY MEMBER LIVING IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. EIGHTY NINE FIFTY FIVE AM IS AN ESSENTIAL PIECE TO HELPING THE STATE ACHIEVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT GOALS. BY DRESSING MINIMUM EVEY READY PARKING INCREASE BEING MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS URBAN MOBILITY HUBS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ALIGN WITH THE WHITE OBJECTIVES OF INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY TO EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE. EIGHTY NINE FIFTY FIVE TAKES A REASONABLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE YOU READY PARKING SPACES. IN EXISTING BUILDINGS ONLY ONE OTHER CONSTRUCTION IS ALREADY OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE TOTAL COST OF THE CHARGING STATION. RELATIVE TO THE INSTALLATION OF AN EEVEE. CHARGING STATION IN ISOLATION. AGAIN WE YOU ALL FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I.

ALL RIGHT THANKS AGAIN MODERATOR AND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE ASK THERE'S ANY COMMENT- FROMCOMMITTEE MEMBERS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD- BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO. HE COULD ENTER BY SHARE BAITS- IF YOU'D LIKE TO. I GUESS I'M JUST A QUICK QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR I HAVE THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF ANY OF THE COST OF IT- IMPACT ON. LOVE YOU KNOW THE BUILDING OF HOUSING UP REQUIRING DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE THEIR FIGHT IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND I GUESS MOVING INTO RESIDENTIAL. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DO DEAL WITH IN THE PRESIDENT. PAUL AS WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON CREATING THE HOUSING. AND ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING I KNOW THAT YOU CHOOSE WITH. THE CHARGING STATIONS ARE ARE HUGE BAT TOP IF IT I JUST THINK IT MIGHT BE KIND OF PREMATURE ALSO IF WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT WOULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE- MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION ON AT THE PRESENT. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR THAT QUESTION IT REALLY BRINGS ME BACK TO- THE HISTORY THAT'S WRITTEN OUT IN. THE ANALYSIS BY MISS RICHES WHERE SHE MENTIONS THE NOW SUSPENSIONS MY BILL FROM. TWENTY THIRTEEN- TEN NINETY. AND WHERE THAT CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE AND I KNOW THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME AGO. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION BUT BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT WAS WHEN THIS CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING WAS OCCURRING. AND IT AND IT WAS A NEGLIGIBLE COST AND IN FACT. BUILDERS ACTUALLY SAW VALUE IN PROVIDING THIS- BECAUSE THEY SAW WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD HOLD AND SO IT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE TODAY. THANK YOU YOU HAVE THE FOUR OF US YOUR BASES OR ANYTHING ELSE. I KNOW THANKS- OKAY THANK YOU- CINECA EURO DID YOU WISH TO RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I AM I READ THIS RIGHT BECAUSE- WHILE I ATE. I THINK IT'S REALLY- THERE'S A NEED TO- DO THE EEVEE CHARGING STATIONS IN NEW CONSTRUCTION MY CONCERN IS- ALTERATION DEMOLITION REPAIR OR ADDITION. TO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. UNITS AND- IT'S ALWAYS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO RETROFIT SOMETHING THEN IT TO BUILD IT THE FIRST TIME. AND WHEN YOU'RE GOING IN IN YOUR YOUR IF YOU'RE DEMOLISHING AND BUILDING A NEW BUILDING THAT IT'S A NEW BUILDING AND I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT- IN PARTICULAR. IN MY COMMUNITY HAVE A LOT OF REALLY OLD APARTMENTS. THAT ON THEIR BEST THEY DON'T LOOK ALL THAT GREAT AND- THERE'S ALWAYS A NEED FOR. FOR REPAIR WETHER IT'S A ROUGH OR A PARKING STRUCTURE OR A- PARKING LOT. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THIS. GIVES AUTOMATIC. APPROVAL TO REQUIRE UP 220% OF THE PARKING SPACES IN EXISTING MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS- IF ANY PERMIT IS PULLED AND AS AS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU DO ON IN AT AN APARTMENT YOU PUT IN NEW HEATERS NEW VENTURE INTO ROUGH ALL OF THAT REQUIRES IT RIGHT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC IN OTHER WORDS DID IT GIVES THEM THE- AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE IT. UP WE- TALKED ABOUT A BUILDING OR ELECTRICAL PERMIT. DOWN AS I HAD MENTIONED I CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ABOUT WHETHER THE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT I MEAN THE HEATER DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY SERIOUS THING BUT IF YOU'RE UPGRADING AN ELECTRICAL PANEL THIS MAKES SENSE TO. FICTIONALISED FULL PANEL AS WE KNOW FROM THE CAPITOL GARAGE CAN HANDLE A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA LOAD- SO WE CAN WE CAN MAKE SURE TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. I THINK WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE POINT THAT I MADE TO SENATOR FACES QUERY IS THAT. OPPOSITION WITH THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS PARTICULARLY FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES TIME DID NOT ARISE- AS WE DEVELOP THE SPILL- AND SO YOU KNOW WE WILL BE. YEAH I'M GLAD TO BE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR STAFF TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. TO THAT PARTICULAR QUERY. WELL I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION AND THAT'S ALWAYS THAT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT LET ME JUST SAY THAT ALL ALL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I WANNA HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT BECAUSE- I DON'T WANT APARTMENT. UNITS TO BE IMPROVED MMHM BECAUSE THEN IT TRIGGERS. SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY NEVER INTENDED AND I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT. IN RURAL CALIFORNIA I DON'T SEE VERY MANY ELECTRIC VEHICLES PERIOD. AND WE HAD A VERY IMPASSIONED SPEECH ON THE FLOOR THIS MORNING AND I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO QUOTE IT EXACTLY RIGHT BUT- ONE OF MY GOOD COLLEAGUES- COMMENTED THAT OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE. GRAHAM IT PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR THE RICH AND- DOES NOT. PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKING WORKING FOLKS IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD- A VEHICLE THAT THAT SERVES THEIR NEEDS- IN RECOVERING SO I WELL I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY I HAVE REAL SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER EVER GONNA REACH DOWN FAR ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GET. ON A THE PROGRAM TO WORK SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY ARE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT. IN IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY WHICH SHOULD BE THE SOUTH COAST AND THE- THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TO REQUIRE LANDLORDS. TO START IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS WHEN THEY DO AN UPGRADE. AND HAVE THEM SIT. EMPTY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME SO- I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MOVING TOO FAR AHEAD OF WHERE WE'RE WHERE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE URBAN AREAS TO MAKE MAKE ME MAKE A LOT OF SENSE BUT IN IN MY AREA I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT AND I'VE- I'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY SO APPRECIATE WHATYOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. I SUPPORT THE IDEAS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING 20% OF THE- THE SPACES TO BE USED WHEN IN REALITY THEY THEY WON'T GET USED USED FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE PUT IN ALL THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR POINT AND I THINK FOR US TO HAVE A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE THAT WE MUST HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES SHOULD BE FOR EVERYBODY. AND THE ABILITY TO USE ELECTRIC VEHICLES MUST BE PRESENT FOR EVERYBODY- THIS IS AND I JUST WANNA MAKE A POINT JUST FOR THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE IN PLACE NOT ACTUAL CHARGERS SO THAT WHEN THE DEMAND IS THERE THAT IS WHEN IT WILL BE AVAILABLE- RATHER THAN BEING LECTURED- CHARGERS THAT WILL JUST SAID- UNUSED VERY GOOD I APPRECIATE THAT DISTINCTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. OUR SOUTHWESTERN IDAHO. OKAY IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. C. B. NINE SIXTY FIVE.

IMPACT THE JURISDICTION OF THAT COMMITTEE- SO SHOULD HAVE PASSED TODAY- THE PLAN IS TO AMEND THIS BILL IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. CONTINGENT UPON THE AGREEMENT OF ALL THREE SENATE CHAIRS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IF AGREEMENT IS NOT REACHED ON THOSE AMENDMENTS BETWEEN THE THREE CHAIRS. BUT I WILL NOT MOVE THE BILL TO THE SENATE FLOOR BUT JUST REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE FIRST AND FOREMOST. HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK AND THOUGHTFUL ASSISTANCE OF. SENATOR MCGUIRE OF ANTON AND HIS COMMITTEE OFFICE. OF SENATOR WIENER. OF HIS INCREDIBLE- THE STAFF. WHO HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS ISSUE- ALLISON AND ERIN AND THEN ALSO KRISTA IN CENTER WINNERS PERSONAL STAFF AND JUST REALLY APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. ON THESE FINAL ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE. ANY PLEASE TODAY. MR TRY TO PRESENT THE B. NINETY NINE. WHICH WOULD CREATE A SPECIALIZED APPEAL PANEL. TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL OFFICIALS SEEK TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. THIS LEGISLATION IS AN EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. INITIALLY PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE HA AIMS TO PREVENT EFFORTS TO BLOCK THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE OTHER FLIGHTS COMPLIES WITH THE OPTICAL GENERAL PLAN. ZONING AND SUBDIVISION STANDARDS. AND REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN THE EVENT THAT THEY DO SO. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S WELL DOCUMENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEFIED THE ACT. DENIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL LOCAL ZONING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE OFFICIALS UNDERSTAND THAT IN MOST CASES AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPONENTS WILL HAVE NO PRACTICAL MEANS TO CHALLENGE THE UNLAWFUL DENIALS. AS THE CURRENT REMEDY. LITIGATION IN SUPERIOR COURT IS ALMOST ALWAYS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING AND OTHERWISE IMPRACTICAL. B. NINETY NINE WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING AN ALTERNATE REVIEW PANEL WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. MODELED OFF AN APPROACH TO SUCCESSFULLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER STATES. THE JURISDICTION OF THE REVIEW PANEL WOULD BE VERY NARROW AND LIMITED TO ONE SOUL ISSUE. WHETHER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VIOLATED THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT BY DISAPPROVING A PROJECT WITHOUT MAKING THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. THE PANEL WOULD THUS BE ABLE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AROUND IMPROPER AND UNLAWFUL DENIALS. IN A MORE EXPEDITED LESS EXPENSIVE LESS CONFRONTATIONAL AND MORE CONSISTENT MANNER. TO BE CLEAR A. B. NINETY NINE SIMPLY PROVIDES A NEW PROCEDURAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IT DOES NOT UP ZONE CHANGE ANY LOCAL ZONING OR LAND USE POLICIES. OR OTHERWISE CHANGE SUBSTANTIVE STATE LAW AROUND HOUSING. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE FOLLOW STATE LAW GOOD FAITH ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE INTERACTION WITH THIS NEW PANEL WELL THOSE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY AND WILLFULLY VIOLATING THE LAW WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. WITH LESS ADVERSARIAL AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS SUPPORTED BY A COALITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUPS HOUSING ADVOCATES AND LOCAL FFICIALS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SACRAMENTO MAYOR MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND TONY BELIEVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU AND AT THE APPROPRIATE. TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IPHONE. THE THANK YOU VERY- IN THANK YOU FOR ALL THE CLARIFICATIONS- THAT YOU MADE AT THE OUTSET. OF ALL APPRECIATED THINK BY. EVERYONE HERE- WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THOSE- LEAD WITNESSES. AT THIS TIME. AND WE'LL START WITH MARK STIVERS. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR- I MARCHED IRISH OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP THE PARTNERSHIP WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ADVISE ON THE PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ADDITION WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MOST OF THE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN THE STATE. THE PARTNERSHIP HEARS OFTEN FROM OUR NONPROFIT DEVELOPER PARTNERS THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE FINANCIAL RISK TO BUY A PROPERTY THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND THESE PARTNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED A GOOD NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNWELCOMING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN THEORY PROTECTS DEVELOPERS FROM ARBITRATED NILES RUN REASONABLE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THE DEVELOPMENTS IN FEASIBLE AND WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF RECENT CHANGES BY CENTER SCANNER TO INCREASE PENALTIES UNDER THE ACT. HOWEVER FOR OUR NONPROFIT DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS THE ACTOR MEANS A RELATIVELY EMPTY PROTECTION OUR PARTNER SIMPLY CANNOT SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES INTEREST AND ADDITIONAL CARRYING COSTS AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF THEIR TIME TO GO THROUGH THE COURTS. AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS HAVE BEEN TRIED AND FOUND SUCCESSFUL IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. RHODE ISLAND ILLINOIS AND OREGON. NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY USE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES IN THE STATES. OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS TELL US IN A B. NINETY NINE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE GIVING THEM GREATER CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS FORWARD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. GET THEM BUILT. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND I AGAIN EXPRESS MY THANKS TO THE TWO POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND THEN PRESS THE SAFF OF THE MANY HOURS THEY'VE PUT IN TO GET US HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOUR TESTIMONY- TONY BOUTIQUE- IF YOU'RE HERE YOU MAY PROCEED IN EARNEST AND YOU'RE ON THE PHONE LINE. YOUR PICTURE. ON IT WILL BE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION.

KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF- WE AGAIN. LAST WEEK A WEEK AND YOU WILL CONTROL. OF LOCAL JURISDICTION. ITS OWN CURRENCY ALL DAY. IF THEY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THIS NEW- MAYBE ONLY WILL LOOK AT IT LOOK AT YOUR- WHICH- THE PROJECT THAT WAS NOT EVEN MICHAEL CRUZ WELL WE'RE NOT TO BE CURRENT IT WAS A RELIEF TO HAVE THEM- WHAT'S THAT- THE BILL REALLY IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT TOOL TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. AND AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOUR CHAIR OFCOMMITTEE HOUSING AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE THEIR STAFF. AND WE MET ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR BECAUSE HE WORKED ON THE ISSUE. OF WEEKLY ARTICLES- ALL. RIGHT. AFTER I BELIEVE SOMETIMES THANK YOU. OKAY THANK- GOING TO ASK IF THERE'S A IN THE WHO. TO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF SO STEP FORWARD PLEASE SEE NONE WILL CHECK YOUR FULL ROOM. ENCINO IN THERE WILL GO TO THE MODERATOR AND ASK. ASK HIM TO LEASE QUEUE UP. ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE OF TOLL CONFERENCE LINE AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE. HEARING THE TOTAL NUMBER THAT YOU SEE IN THE QUEUE YEAH WE WOULD REMIND EVERYONE THAT AT THE OUTSET OF THIS MEETING REGARDLESS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OR THE BILL WE ESTABLISHED A MAXIMUM OF TEN MINUTES FOR SUPPORT. IN TEN MINUTES FOR OPPOSITION M. S. CONSOLE AND THE POLICE ARE- BE MINDFUL THAT AND TO LET ME KNOW IF WORK CD NOTED ANY POINT- THIS IS FOR. NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT ONLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR A. B. NINE EIGHTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD ONCE AGAIN THOSE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME PLEASE. THERE ARE NO LINES IN Q. OKAY WE WILL COME BACK TO OPPOSITION AT AT THIS POINT AND WE DO HAVE A LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES IDENTIFIED ON THIS BILL BRIAN A GUSTO AND ALO LOOSE MARATHI- BRIAN IF YOU ARE ON THE COAST PHONE LINE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRYING TO GOT- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT AND ALSO SHARING. THE CONCERNS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- WE ARE WE'RE GET REGRETFULLY AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND WHILE WE'VE HAD THIS. VERY THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. AND YET ARE CONCERNED THEIR MAIN RESOLVED- NOTWITHSTANDING TODAY PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE. TWO POINTS- IN THAT REGARD THE FIRST IS THAT REQUIRING EXHAUSTION WE BELIEVE THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS IN OTHER WORDS MANDATING THAT THE DEVELOPER GO TO THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. DIMINISHES THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND I. BELIEVE THAT IS WHY THE ANALYSIS NOTES A NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER GROUPS WHO HAD BEEN IN SUPPORT OF GONE TO NEUTRAL THE SECOND POINT. THAT ONE ELABORATE ON IN A MOMENT IS THAT OUR CLIENTS. AND OTHERS WITH STANDING TO ENFORCE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT YOU AREN'T SUBJECT TO ADD EXHAUSTED REQUIREMENT. FOR THOSE OF US pBIFURCATED PROCESS INJECTS UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL DELAY THAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER ON THAT FIRST POINT I JUST WANT TO. KNOW THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS THAT THE MERE THREAT OF LITIGATION OFTEN SUCCESSFULLY ENSURES COMPLIANCE WE- WE TALK ABOUT. HOW WE DON'T SEE MUCH LITIGATION- HOW OTHER ALLEGATIONS JUDGMENT ABOUT THE REALITY OF. THE THREAT OF LITIGATION. OFTEN RESOLVES THE ISSUE REPORTED TO GO TO COURT AND SO WE REMAIN CONCERNED A MANDATE THAT DEVELOPERS USE THIS SEMESTER PROCESS. PUTS GIVING THEM A CHOICE. DOCTORS ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO COURT REMOVES AN ERA FROM THAT QUIVERED MAKES LITIGATION ACCORDING PORTS ARE MORE DISTANT THREATS AND THEREFORE IN A LESS OMINOUS ONE AND THEREFORE REDUCING THE ABILITY OF DEVELOPERS TO PERHAPS COULD- COMPLYING SHORT OF ANY. LITIGATION FOR OUR CLIENT BUT NOT SECOND POINT BIG DIFFERENT CREASING WE COMPLICATED OUR CRICKET LITIGATION PROCESS THAT'S PROPOSED- WE DON'T THINK WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S BY THE PROPOSED DEMANDS. IS THAT DEEPLY CONCERNING FOR US THIS IS A FAIRLY UNUSUAL PROCESSES PROPOSE WERE. POSSIBLY UNPRECEDENTED WHERE SOME PARTIES MUST EXHAUST REPORTED BEEN STRAIGHT UP BODIES THAT OFFER. AND OTHERS LIKE OUR CLIENTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS TO GO DIRECTLY TO COURT. CREATING A POSSIBILITY NOW OF DOING LITIGATION I THINK MANY OF YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT TO MAKE ENFORCEMENT MORE. DIFFICULT- WE IF. BY FILE PIZZA WITH A WORK THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEVERAL IN THE H. EIGHTEEN ONE OF THEM SEVERAL SAY WE THOUGHT GOTTEN DEVELOPER FILED DEVELOPER MR IS NINETY NINE BODY BUT WE ONLY HAVE NINETY DAYS UNDER THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTATION TO GET ALL OF OUR CLAIMS FILED SO WE CAN'T WAIT THE RESOLUTION THAT PROCESS. I'M NOT NOW WHAT'S LIKE TO BE THE REAL OF THAT WORK HELLO GOVERNMENT THAT'S NOW BOTH PRECEDING ARE GOING TO SEEK A STAY OF THE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE NOW OUR CASES SIMPLY TRADING TODAY. INCLUDING UNCERTAINTY AND DELAY. AND THEN THE BILL SAYS THAT THE DECISION OF THE BODY BECOMES ACTION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NOW YOU'VE- GOT AN- ADMINISTRATIVE BODY RENDERING AN OPINION THAT- DECISION STEPS INTO THE SHOES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. UNITS STREAM IN OUR LITIGATION. SO NOW WE'RE NOT ATTACKING THE LOCAL. GOVERNMENT PROCESS ARE TALKING. ATTACKING THE OUTCOME OF THE- APPEAL PROCESS WHICH WE WERE NOT AND ARE NOT THERE TO HELP BUILD THE RECORD WE CANNOT PRESENT EVIDENCE SO. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. WITH THIS. INJECTS MORE UNCERTAINTY. AND POTENTIALLY REDUCES THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE PRODUCTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR CLIENTS WE SHARED THESE CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR. YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT TODAY WE REMAIN A PART OF THE LAST MINUTE UNTIL WE CAN RESOLVE. THIS BY THIS SIGNIFICANT OUTSTANDING CONCERNS WITH THIS SOMEWHAT. NOVEL PROCESS SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS- WE REMAIN A PERSON CAN SHARE. THIRD WITH CREW TO. IN THE MR. FOR ON THE LINE AND POLICE UP BY THE MINUTE LIMIT PER. OPPOSITE SPEAKER AND IN FAIRNESS TO THE SPORTS SPEAKERS WHO ALREADY SPOKEN. TO OTHERS WHO WERE TESTIFYING OF THE BILLS TODAY THANK YOU. AT TWO MINUTES I WILL WILL DO MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITYTO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS LOUIS MONTANA. I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF. THE CALIFORNIA BEAT. THAT PERSON IN THAT THANK AUTHOR AND ALL THE PARTIES WORKING ON THIS BILL AFTER THEIR DILIGENT EFFORT IN RESOLVING. SOME OF THE REALLY CONCERNING AMENDMENTS COMING OUT OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT THE FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THAT THEY ALL. ACCOMPANIED THE ADOPTED A POSE MUCH AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AFTER ABOUT HEARING. ABOUT THE MOMENT TODAY INTO GO MOST OF THE WAY IN ATTRACTING ALL OF OUR CONCERNS. SO I WILL NOT ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY NINE TODAY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND REALLY EXPRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF. ADDRESSING THEM IN THIS PROCESS THAT. I MISSED REQUIRED MR GABRIEL. LAID OUT- IN THEIR COMMENTS EARLIER- I LIED ALL OF MY CAR. ACTUALLY I THE IF YOU- THE PIPER PROCEED- CONCERN. I THE TARGET ATTACK- OUTSTANDING- INTO THE OFFICE. GETTING UNDER THE ACA- THAT MR AUGUSTA MENTIONED IN HIS REGARD SO I WILL NOT GO OVER THAT- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO GET THIS LAST FEATURE RIGHT. A CALIFORNIA B. WORKS WITH A LOT OF GIVE ME ORDERS AROUND THE STATE. WHO SUE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE VIOLATING STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. ON HOUSING- ON THEIR OWN. NOT ON THE DEVELOPERS. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IT CAN OUR BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR DEVELOPERS TO SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN REPEAT PLAYERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO MANY OF THEM FEEL VERY CHILLED ACTED IN THERE RIGHT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING IT RIGHT. UP WITH THIRD PARTIES WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY MAKING SURE THAT WE- DO AND THAT PLAN CORRECTLY- I THOUGHT MAYBE ONE THE LACK. OF POINT OF MAKE HERE IS THAT REQUIRING AN APPLICANT HE USED THE OFFICE REALLY RIPS THE LAYING A FINAL RESOLUTION AND MAKING IT HARDER IN MANY CASES THE POSSIBLE. RIPPLES PURSING MOBILE RIGHT UNDER OUR NORMAL LIVES. I COULD PLUG IT COULD NOT HAVE. BARRED THE OPPOSITE BU YOU HAVE THE STANDING UNDER THE HSA- I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A IT'S PROBABLY A MUCH STEEPER APPROACH TO ESTABLISH THAT. OFFICE AND THEN REQUIRE ENFORCEMENT GIVING THE OFFICE FIND OUT ABOUT THE PEOPLE ACTED. OTHERWISE WE RISK INTENTIONALLY. BUT NO IMPORT AJ CLAIMS FOR RELEVANT. AFTER YOU KNOW YOU'RE MONTHS AT THE OFFICE CREATED- THEY THAT YOU KNOW THAT- THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT NOT MOVING THE BILL FORWARD IF WE'RE REALLY NOT ABLE TO LAND THE PLANE- IT AND YOU KNOW IF ALL THE INTRICATE LEGISLATORS ARE ARE NOT ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT THEY GIVE ME THE NECESSARY CONFIDENCE COULD BE HERE TODAY AND NOT URGING A NO VOTE I YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT EVERY. ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS WHO SPOKE TODAY AND PUT INTO THE ALONG WITH THEIR STAFF MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS REALLY. MOVE ARE GREAT FUN WITH ALL THE HELP WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY IN THE PERSON THAT- I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT HIRING OUT TO DO I THINK THAT ALREADY OUT. CAN BE DONE IN TIME. OR REDUCE THE THREAT OF WAR AND I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- AND I REALLY REALLY WANT TO. URGE ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING ON A BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. LANDING THE PLANE CORRECTLY. ON ON ON ON NOT. ELIMINATOR THE AJ'S. THE H. A. BRILLIANT. COMPORT HOW THEY LOG. HAS IMPORT THING AND RESULTING- THE PROPERTY.

THANK YOU COULD LIKE TO STATE OPPOSITION TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WHEN YOU PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE THREE LINES IN Q. WE'LL GO FIRST TO LINE ONE FIFTY TWO. MR KERR MEMBERS YOU CAN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES AND RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE AS DRAFTED- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DIGEST THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER IT FIRST GLANCE WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS FROM OUR WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OR THE OTHER CENTERS- ON THOSE AMENDMENTS- BUT AS OF RIGHT. NOW SIR WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THANK YOU. ONE FIFTY EIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS CHRIS LEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA WANT TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES CURRENTLY OPPOSED BUT LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS. ONE TWELVE. GLOBAL CALIFORNIA THIS IS RECALL AND WE OPPOSE. NINETY EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU ONE ONE FIFTY SEVEN IF YOU'D STILL LIKE TO SHARE YOUR OPPOSITION WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT ONE AND THEN ZERO. TURN OFF FOR THE LINE TO GET THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MODERATOR- WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE KNOWS COMMITTEES OPPORTUNITY- TO- COMMENT EXPRESSING CONCERNS- THAT WE HAVE FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEMINAL. RECOGNIZE SENATOR BATES FIRST FOLLOWED BY SENATOR OF TROUBLED. THANK YOU I TERRON COURTESY ON. THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE BEEN READING ON REALLY RAISES ISSUES THAT ARE CONSTITUTIONAL IN TERMS OF WHAT SO THIS PARTICULAR. APPOINTED A BODY- COULD DO IN TERMS OF OVER RIDING OUT THE LOCAL LAND USE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FIGHT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. GOING FORWARD WHICH FOR ME TODAY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OUT THIS IS IN DEFENSE OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DOES NOT PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DICTATE AT LEAST A PERCENTAGE OF THESE LARGE DEVELOPMENT FILE WOULD BE FOR SALE. A LOT OF- THE INPUT I'VE RECEIVED IS THAT MANY OF THE ONES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE LARGE- APARTMENT COMPLEXES THAT'S VERY GOOD I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT ISN'T A GREAT STARTING POINT BUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT IN OUR- A LEGISLATOR. LEGISLATURE TODAY AN INFECTION OVER THE YEARS THAT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY HOMES PROVIDES THAT INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH GROWTH WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF POVERTY. SO I THINKTHERE'S SOMETHING WITH THE HHA THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT ALSO AS WE GO FORWARD AND I JUST PUT THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR. FROM YOU KNOW MY FOLKS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT SAY WE WANT OUR HOUSE AND WE WANT TO MEET ARENA BUT WE WANT TO HAVE SOME AUTHORITY TO. DEVELOP A PLANNED COMMUNITY PLAN WHICH WAS THE FOUNDATION FRANKLY OF WHAT DEVELOPED IN ORANGE COUNTY I IN THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. THAT YOU HAD ON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RENTAL STARTING OUT AND MOVING TO SOMETHING ON A CONDO AND ON UP THE LADDER. IN THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAVE BANNED ALL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM- CERTAINLY AS LONG AS YOU KNOW MY PARENTS HAVE LIVED HERE AND CERTAINLY THE OPPORTUNITY IT PROVIDED. MANY OF US WHO ARE HERE SO- I THINK THE CONSTITUTIONAL. ISSUES BACK TO THAT REALLY NEED TO BE VETTED. BEFORE WE TAKE THE STAFF ON A PRE SOMETHING. THAT HAVE PAID FOR GOOD BASE NOT NOT SAYING THAT WHAT SONDER ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE FOR THE BAD ACTORS SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE WE TAKE STEPS LIKE THE F. R. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- JUST SUGGESTS THE AUTHOR YOU CAN DO IT. ON COMMENTS YOU MAY JUST INCLUDE YOUR OWN COMMENTS SAID DURING YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU SO DESIRE- THE MEAT- MOVED TO CENTER- CHILL BOTH. THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN THE SENATE BILL NINE EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS FOR CONNECTING WITH ME AND MY OFFICE THIS MORNING. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN THIS BILL IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY SO FAR THERE ALSO GROUPS IN THE MID TO CHANGING THEIR POSITIONS. BEFORE I GET MY FINAL VOTE ON THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IN ITS FINAL FORM IN PRINT. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO DO I REALLY DO. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS FROM A DISTRICT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED FIRST. THEREFORE I WILL BE ASSISTING IN THIS MEASURE TODAY BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEE IN THE FUTURE. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL BOGAN OTHER MEMBERS WHO WISH TO BE RECOGNIZED IN A WAY BECAUSE KIM- MISTER CHAIR I WILL MOVE THE BILL- AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN WHEN. MEASURES ARE TRIPLE REFERRED. AND I THINK-AB NINE EIGHT NINE SHOWS THE VALUE OF HAVING- THREE. COMPETING ODDS COMMITTEE'S. REVIEW IT BECAUSE THE REMAINING ISSUES THAT ARE AT LEAST. OUTLINED HAD THAT THAT WE GOT. ALL PERTAIN TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I KNOW THAT. THE CHAIRS HERE AND IS FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION. THAT'S GOING ON- I'M- YOU KNOW I DID ALL THE POINTS YOU RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WESTERN CENTERED ON. THE PROCESS AND- THERE'S SORT OF. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. WHY DEVELOPER WOULD CHOOSE THE- ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS STANDARD VERSUS THE NOVO ON APPEAL BUT THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. A EXCELL M. IN IMPORTANT WORK TO BE DONE- I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THREE CHEERS WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIR. WHO UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T BEEN IN ON THE CONVERSATIONS THIS IS. HIS PING PONG BETWEEN HOUSING AND GOVERNANCE. AND AGAIN SOMETIMES THE THORNIER. CHALLENGE IS THE PROCESS IS TO GO ON VERSES. THIS S LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS HOUSING. IT'S HOW DO WE GET HOW DO WE CREATE THAT PATHWAY SO WITH THAT. YOU HAVE A COMMOTION ARNOLD. GOOD LUCK TO THE THREE CHAIRS AND THE AUTHOR. VERY GOOD THANK YOU- BEFORE WE- REMOVE THE ITEM OF FORMALLY WILL GO TO A. COMMENTS BY THE CENTER CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU. MR SO- TYPE. THAT D. D. PROPONENTS AND THE AUTHOR OR TRYING TO CREATE A PATHWAY. THAT WOULD RESPECT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND YET ALLOW FOR YOU KNOW SOME ENTITIES BASED SPECIFICALLY ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOLKS NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS TO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE EXPENSE OF GOING TO COURT. AND- THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THE VARIOUS ENFORCEMENT ASPECTS OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT REALLY CAN ONLY BE FULLY ACHIEVED IN COURT YES CERTAINLY YES WE WANT TO AVOID GOING TO COURT IT'S REALLY TRYING TO BE THE STICK THE ULTIMATE STICK AND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN NO WAY THIS EFFORT UNDERMINES THE ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT YET FULLY AGREED UPON. SO DOES ME GIVE ME A LITTLE PAUSE- BUT I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND IT- WITH THAT SENSE OF TRUST THAT THESE WILL BE LANDED AND THE ENFORCEMENT POWERS OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WOULD BE RESPECTED- SO- I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THE TICKET CENTER AT ANYONE ELSE ON ON THE FLOOR A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WAS TO BE RECOGNIZED. ON THE BILL. THE CENTER NUMBER THANK YOU I'M SORRY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN CDS PLEASE WHAT WHAT'S THAT A WHITE HOUSE HE SAID THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE- WISH TO. JUMP INTO THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU- AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THERE WERE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS THERE- HIT YOUR CLOTHES YOU FEEL FREE TO DO IT HOWEVER YOU WISH IF YOU WANNA RESPOND TO COMMENTS QUESTION IT THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAN FIRSTLY THANK ALL THE SENATORS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS IF I JUST MIGHT. ADDRESS A FEW OF THEM JUST I WILL SAY AND THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR SHARING YOUR YOUR CONCERNS LITTLE BIT SURPRISED TO HEAR THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING FLAG FOR US BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND WE'RE PRETTY CLEARLY DRAWING WITHIN THE LINES ON THIS ONE IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND SO YOU KNOW HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS BUT FOR THE MOST PART. I THINK WE'RE WE'RE SQUARELY IN LINE WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH IS SAY THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT REQUIRES HE APPLIES EQUALLY TO DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE BUILT FOR OWNERSHIP SO THIS IS ALSO. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO HELP. MORE PEOPLE. THAT AND THAT THE WEALTH CREATION THAT YOU MENTIONED SO. SO HOPING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A CONVERSATION PERHAPS IF WE GET OUT TODAY ON YOUR PHOTO- YOUR PHONE AT A LATER STAGE IN THE PROCESS. I'M JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO A- TURQUOISE SENATOR SKINNER. AND WE COMPLETELY SHARE YOUR CONCERNS IN PERSPECTIVE HERE AND THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS UNDERMINE. THE REALLY GOOD WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH AND OTHERS HAVE DONE WITH THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT THE PURPOSE HERE. IS TO STRENGTHEN THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY FOR THE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE. PART OF WHAT. ATTRACTED US TO THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT IS TWO THINGS ONE- THAT WAS BROUGHT TO US BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WHICH WE THE LEGISLATURE CREATED. FOR ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO STRENGTHEN. THE BUILT UP AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY HEARD- IN INTERVIEWS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS IN THE SPACE AS THEY WENT AROUND THE STATE. AND TALK TO PEOPLE. AND THE OTHER THING THAT GIVES ME CONFIDENCE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT. AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S BEEN IN PLACE IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW. THERE'S RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BY MIT. WHERE THEY LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE VERY CONCLUSIVELY. THE BENEFITS OF HAVING AN APPROACH LIKE THIS THE BENEFITS OF HAVING AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND HOW THAT ACTUALLY. WAS ABLE TO HELP MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. AND WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE IN A PARTICULARLY. WAS THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ULTIMATELY SETTLED- DEBT THAT THIS PROCESS SECTION COURAGE EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT CASES TO GET TO SETTLEMENT VERY QUICKLY SO IT'S ACTUALLY A WAY. TO HELP PEOPLE TO GET TO YES TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOLKS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH I ACTUALLY THINK WOULD BE. A VERY POSITIVE THING GIVEN. GIVEN THE MIXED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS RAN SO I WOULD JUST SAY. IN CONCLUSION. THANK YOU TO YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS. OF ALL THREE COMMITTEES FOR. NOT FOR INDULGING US FOR THEIR FOR THEIR STAFF FOR THE- TREMENDOUS HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. REALLY APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A PATHWAY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. I AM I AM. SOMEWHAT OF AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST BUT I ACTUALLY THINK. THERE'S A VERY CLEAR PATH FORWARD FOR US IN SEVERAL WAYS FOR US TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. I HOPE THIS BILL WILL WORK WELL FOR EVERYBODY AND SO WITH THAT- WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I BOTH. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. OKAY WELL THANK VERY MUCH MAY BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T- EXPRESS- SENATOR WIENER SAID THANKS FOR WORKING WITH HIM- AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE BILL- HE COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BUT- IT'S- REALLY THE STENCH OF THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN. TAKING THE LEAD HERE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION I BELIEVE BY SENATOR WHAT KOWSKI THAT'S BEEN CONFIRMED. ALAS CONSOLE NICOLE ROLE PLEASE. THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE EIGHT NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR CORTEZ E. NIGHT ORTEZ THE I'D SAY IT'S NOT LETTING. COPYRIGHT COPYRIGHT BY ADMIN EGGMAN I REQUIRE A CHORE BOOK. THE CHILDREN NOT TURNING SCANNER. SCANNER I REMEMBER. NUMBER NOT VOTING WITH CASKEY CASKEY I. FIVE TWO ZERO. WILL BE FIVE TO ZERO KEEP THE ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBER. THANK YOU. RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND FOLLOW ORDERS- SOME MEMBER BRYANT WOULD BE NEXT WITH THE B. ONE ZERO FOUR THREE TEN FORTY THREE I BELIEVE IS THE NUMBER ON THAT BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME IN THE END YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU SENATOR I THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MAYBE TEN FORTY THREE WILL ADD ADDITIONAL INCOME CATEGORY STATE HOUSING LAW COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING BELOW THE FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THE HOUSING PROGRAMS RELY ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DEFINE INCOME CATEGORIES TO PROVIDE FORMULAS FOR CALCULATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. CURRENT LAW DEFINES FOUR INCOME CATEGORIES WITH THE LOWEST CATEGORY COMPRISING OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING BELOW THE HOWEVER THE GREAT DISPARITY BETWEEN HOUSEHOLD GROUP TOGETHER IN THIS CATEGORY FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE ANNUAL INCOME FOR A HOUSEHOLD OF FOUR IN THIS CATEGORY WAS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED HOWEVER HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON THE BRINK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS REPORTED INCOMES OF LESS THAN SEVENTEEN. THOUSAND DOLLARS. A RECENT REPORT BY THE LA COUNTY WHICH INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY TO CAPTURE THEIR MOST LOW INCOME RESIDENTS INDIATED THAT ABOUT TEN PERCENT. OF THE LA COUNTY RENTERS LIVE BELOW THE OUT OF THESE HOUSEHOLD ALMOST INCOME ON HOUSING TALKS. BABY TEN FORTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN STATE HOUSING POLICY. BY STAFF WISHING AN ACUTELY LOW INCOME CATEGORY. AND A FORMULA TO CALCULATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS FOR THIS GROUP. THIS NEW CATEGORY WOULD BE MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING OUT OF BELOW I WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS. FOR CLOSE TO FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS. BRING ME TODAY I'M JOINED BY LAKE COUNTY'S DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF REGIONAL PLANNING ANY BOAT AT. VERY THANK YOU SO MEMBER AMY BORDER. IF YOU WERE ON THE PHONE LINE YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON AS ASSEMBLYMAN BRIAN SAID MY NAME IS AMY BOWED ACT. AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL PLANNING FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I WANT TO FIRST ST I SIMPLY NUMBER BRIAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC ENTER THE CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING WITH US ON MICHELLE. H. AS STATED AT TEN FORTY THREE WHAT A MAN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DEFINE A NEW INCOME CATEGORIES FOR CALCULATING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. THE EX. LOW INCOME LEVEL. IT'S NEW DEFINITION WOULD BE COMPRISED OF FAMILIES LIVING WITHIN THE ZERO TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME BRACKETS. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT. IT WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR THESE FOLKS TO BE IN THERE THE- EXISTING VERY LOW INCOME CATEGORY. BUT IN FACT WE DO NEED A SEPARATION BETWEEN THESE ACUTELY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND ARE VERY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. EACH CURRENTLY THERE IS NO FORMULA AND THEY COULDN'T IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO CALCULATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES OF LESS THAN 30% A. M. I. E. AS THAT'S CALLED- EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. I ALSO MENTIONED IT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COUNTY HAS ISSUED AN ANNUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MS OUR RECORDS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY PREPARED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CORPORATION. THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE A. ALLY CATEGORY DEFINED AS 00215% A. M. A. M. HI N. AS RICH AS JUST STATED THE MOST RECENTLY RECORDED. INFORMATION FROM TWENTY NINETEEN SHOWS THAT 10% OF RENTER HOUSEHOLDS FALL WITHIN THE 15% AMR. WORKING EARLY OF THE HOUSEHOLD 69% IDENTIFY AS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AMENDING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE STATE TO REQUIRE SENATE B UNITS BE PROVIDED AT THIS SPECIFIC INCOME LEVEL OR REQUIRE THAT REPLACEMENT UNITS BE MADE AVAILABLE. ACTUALLY A SIMPLE AMENDMENT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THAT WOULD HAVE FAR REACHING POSITIVE BENEFITS IN STABILIZING HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION SHRANK SHORT LA COUNTY SUPPORTS THIS BILL WHEN ASKED FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. AND I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TERM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE GALLERY AND ASK THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS SUPPORT POSITION ON A. B.

TWELVE TWENTY LAST SESSION I AUTHORED AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A CALM COME COMPREHENSIVE POLICY SOLUTION FOR THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. AB TWELVE TWENTY IN THE FORM BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A RESULT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT RESTRUCTURING CHANGES SO WE CAN ENSURE WE ARE PROVIDING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT TO HELP THE STATE IS COMBATING HOMELESSNESS. AB TWELVE TWENTY MAKES A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE CURRET HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL THIS MEASURE RENAMES THE HOMELESS COUNSEL TO THE CALIFORNIA INTER. COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. THIS NAME CHANGE MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL AND WE'LL SET THE STAGE FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP AND COMMITTEES. MEMBERSHIP WILL CONSIST OF DIRECTORS AND SECRETARIES OF THE STATE. INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCE INCLUDING UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. IN MARCH THE HOMELESS COUNCIL ADOPTED ITS FIRST EVER ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE THE ACTION PLAN PROVIDES THE DETAILS ON HOW THE HOMELESS COUNCIL WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. THE ACTION PLAN COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME AS THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS BEGINNING TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS THE STATE MUST ENSURE PROPER AND EFFICIENT COORDINATION AMONG STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS. OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE SIMILAR COUNCIL STRUCTURES SO THIS IS A STANDARD MODEL. THIS LEGISLATOR HAS DEDICATED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WHILE STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE COUNCIL IS COMPRISED OF STATE LEADERS AND DEPARTMENT HEADS WHO ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATED. COORDINATE AND RESPOND TO HOMELESSNESS. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME LOUIS MERON T. LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA YIMBY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OKAY THANK YOU MISS MARTINEZ PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THINK IT SHARE A LITTLE SMARTER WITH CALIFORNIAN B. HERE IN SPORT- MAYBE THE TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT. IN GENERAL AND THE STATE NEEDS A MORE STREAMLINED BOB DOLE AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO RESOLVING WHAT VOTERS ARE GUARD AT THE GATE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM AFTER THE LEGISLATURE TO BE RESOLVED. OUT OF HOMELESSNESS I ACQUIRED IN THE MEMBER I MEAN IF IT'S EXTRA COMMITMENT. INCREASING THE FOCUS ON HOMELESSNESS AND INCREASING WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IF I COULD PAY FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I THINK THIS BILL MOVES US BOTH BOTH BOTH MISDIRECTION AGREES NOT FOCUSED. AND SET THAT UP FOR FURTHER INCREASES AND NOT FOCUS ON THE FAMILY MEMBER MENTION. WITH THAT HI- I THINK THE BILL IS. QUITE SIMPLE AND- I'M QUITE GOOD SO I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE GONNA CHECK THE GALLERY AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS SUPPORT POSITION ON A. B. TWELVE TWENTY SCENE KNOWING THERE TO TESTIFY.

IN CENTER CALL THE EURO. BUT YOU KNOW THE FOURTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR HI I AM A- WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR- FOR TAKING TAKING THIS ON LET ME JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M HOPING THAT THIS BILL WILL DO AND I AM NOT SURE. IT DOES IS TO FIGURE OUT- TO TASK THIS NEW ORGANIZATION WITH A- WITH COLLECTING DATA. SO THAT WE CAN MEASURE SUCCESS- AND ALSO. WE CAN LOOK AT. WHAT HIS WORKING BEST IN WHICH COMMUNITIES SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE ON. I REPRESENT SIX COUNTIES AND- PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EVERY COUNTY IS DOING THINGS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THEIR COCS AND I CAN'T GET DATA ON WELL NUMBER ONE IS WE DO WE DO OUR- OUR HOMELESS. COUNT AS A AS A POINT IN TIME AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT I'M NOT SURE I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IS A BETTER WAY BUT- I DO KNOW THAT THE- THE POINT ACCOUNT HAS SOME REAL. CHALLENGES AND I THINK IF YOU ASKED ANYBODY ON THE STREET TODAY THEY WOULD SAY THAT HOMELESSNESS IS GOTTEN WORSE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE SPENT. MULTIPLE MILLIONS MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THE MONEY THAT WE PUT OUT FOR PROJECT ROOM KEY. I THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF THE PROJECT. THAT BOUGHT HOTELS HOTELS AND IS REFURBISHING THEM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HOUSED BECAUSE OF THAT AND- SO IT YOU MIGHT JUST THINK THAT THAT KEEPING THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW H. CD IS STARTING TO COLLECT UP- A LOT OF DATA BUT- THE MORE THAT WE CAN SEE IT FROM. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE ROLL OUT MY NEED I THINK THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE SO- I'M HOPING THAT THAT THAT'LL BE ONE OF THE TASKS AND- I DO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I THINK IT'S IT IT'S THEM. WE'VE SET IT UP IS GOOD MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. P. FIFTY CENT OR ANYONE ELSE ANY OF THE OTHER SENATORS ON THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO COMMENT ON THE BILL IF NOT WE CAN ENTERTAIN A MOTION. CETERA BECAUSE HE MOVES THE BILL. IT WILL COME BACK TO THE ALTAR TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- FROM YOU- YOU KNOW IT'S TIME THAT WE RESTRUCTURE AND EMPOWER THIS COUNCIL TO SERVE AS A STATEWIDE FACILITATOR AND COORDINATOR ON OUR HOMELESSNESS AND- INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TEN HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA- AND- WHILE. YOU KNOW THIS BILL DOWN DOESN'T MANDATE THE DATA COLLECTION THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES CONCURRENTLY I THINK I BELIEVE YOU HEARD ONE TODAY BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL- THAT IS THE DATA- COLLECTION. PART OF THE HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW THESE TWO BILLS ARE BOTH- B. WE BOTH HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH WITH THIS THIS TAKES CARE OF THE COUNCIL STRUCTURE. AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY AND DATA COLLECTION- FROM OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- I AGREE WITH YOU WEAK ACCOUNTABILITY IS IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO HAVE METRICS. OF WENT EVERY YEAR TO SEE HOW WE ARE PROGRESSING HOW HOW WHAT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS ENDING HOMELESSNESS- SO I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY COLLEAGUES ON THAT AND I THINK THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL VERY FOCUSED ON END- THE LEGISLATURE DESERVES TO SEE THAT RIGHT TO SEE THAT DATA FROM OUR- OUR INVESTMENTS RIGHT AND I AGREE WITH YOU- BUT- SO TODAY I'M JUST ASKING. FOR YOUR VOTE. ON A. B. TWELVE TWENTY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MEMBER- WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITEHOUSE GIVEN THE BILLS WAS CONSOLED CULTURAL PLEASE. THIS IS A SUMMARY BILL TWELVE TWENTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REAVIS THE MOTON IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR CORTEZ E. CORTEZ HE I'D BATES. BATES III COPYRIGHT COPYRIGHT BY ADMIN. EGGMAN I THANK THEM BY THE BUYER WHAT SHOULD BOOK A TROUBLED EYES SCANNER. INNER BY A MEMBER NUMBER I THINK WE CAN SKI WITH HUSKY I EIGHT ZERO. OKAY WILL KEEP THE PHONE CALL FOR THE OFFICE OF MEMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO E. B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THE AUTHOR ON THE BILL OF SOME REMEMBER HOLDEN PRESENTING THE BILL WILL BE SENATOR O'TOOLE FOLKS. A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE OF COURSE SO OTHERWISE IT WOULD BEEN QUITE A LONG WAIT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SENATOR. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN TODAY A. B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY THAT I THANK ME FINANCE HOUSING IS PART OF IT OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE PROJECT ONLY WHEN THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS REQUIRED FOR THE OPERATION OF THE PROJECT. ADDITIONALLY NO PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT CAN BE FINANCED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS TO ENSURE THERE'S NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS. UNDER CURRENT LAW I THINK IS AUTHORIZED TO FINANCE A WIDE VARIETY OF PUBLIC AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BUT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES HOUSING WITHOUT DEFINING THE SCOPE OF THAT RESTRICTION. CORRECT CLEAR INDICATION OF WHY. THE ABSOLUTE% PROHIBITION ON HOUSING IN THE IPAD ACT CREATES A FINANCING GAP. BY EXCLUDING ALL PROJECTS THAT CONTAIN ANY ELEMENT OF HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE A FACULTY HOUSING FOR SCHOOL'S GROUNDSKEEPERS OR OPERATORS FACILITIES SUMMER YOUTH CAMPS AND TREATMENT RELATED HOUSING FOR SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT BE FINANCED BY THE BANK. UNDER AB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. AS THE FINANCER OF LAST RESORT FOR MANY PROJECTS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ITEMS TO ADD AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE STATE'S TOOL BELT TO INCREASE MORE TARGETED AND CREATIVE APPROACHES TO HOUSING. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME AMBER MADISON FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL OKAY THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WILL GO TO THE LEAD SUPPORT WITH THIS AT THIS TIME IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON ABIT MADISON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THE I. BANK ACT PROVIDES CRUCIAL POINT OF CRUCIAL FINANCING MECHANISM FOR PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES THAT SOMETIMES INCLUDE AN ELEMENT OF HOUSING. CA IS HERE TO SUPPORT A B. TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WOULD CLARIFY THE AUTHORITY OF THE I. BANK TO INCLUDE FINANCING PROJECTS PUT HOUSING ELEMENTS WHEN THOSE ELEMENTS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FINANCED PROJECT. THIS CLARIFICATION WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF MOVING PROJECTS ALONG THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED. SINCE EIGHTY FOUR NINETY SEVEN MAKES IT CLEAR THAT NO PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT CAN BE FINANCED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS. BY CLARIFYING THE TERM HOUSING UNDER THE I THINK ACT THIS BILL EXPANDS HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE WHILE ENSURING THERE IS NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS. THEREFORE EIGHTY FOUR NINETY SEVEN WILL BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND CREATING MORE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO CALIFORNIA SO DESPERATELY NEED. FOR THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. ACTUALLY REQUEST- I WROTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I WILL COME.

THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARIAN IS- OFFER HERE YET. HE'S THE AUTHORS IN ROUTE. OKAY WE'RE- CAN A PAUSE NOT RECESS WE'RE GONNA PAUSE ONE OF THE ALTAR HERE MOMENTARILY SOUNDS LIKE. OKAY THE- THE AUTHORS HERE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS AB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. IN THE SOON AS YOU GET SITUATED- WE'RE READY TO HEAR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF PRESENTING A B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE- THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS LAW ESTABLISHES THAT THE PURPOSE OF CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING CODES IS TO PRESERVE. AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT BUILDING CODES ARE GOOD AT KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE IN EARTHQUAKES ARE CODES DO NOT DO LITTLE TO PREVENT DAMAGE LIMIT BUILDING CLOSURE TIMES OR LIMIT FINANCIAL LOSSES FOR MOST BUILDINGS. THIS BILL MAYBE THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. HELP COMMUNITIES RECOVER MORE QUICKLY FROM DAMAGING EARTHQUAKES IN THREE WAYS AND COLLEAGUES SAY YOU'VE BEEN IN A HEARING FOR A WHILE BUT I WANT TO DO IS JUST GO OVER THESE THREE POINTS. AND THEN JUST FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE. IN THE ANALYSIS THAT I WANTED TO CORRECT AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO- THREE THINGS IT CLARIFIES THAT ARE BUILDING CODE IS MEANT TO SUPPORT RECOVERY AS WELL AS SAFETY. TO PROTECT LIVELIHOODS AS WELL AS LINES. IT ALSO IT ALLOWS CITIES AND COUNTIES TO AMEND THE STATE CODE TO ADDRESS. RECOVERY AS A LOCAL PRIORITY- IT CHARGES THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO SET THE MINIMUM STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO POST EARTHQUAKE RECOVERY. AND THE AS FOR SOME OF THE JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF POINTS IN THE ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY ON PAGE FOUR. THE SENTENCE THAT TO AT THE END OF PARAGRAPH THREE STATES A FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARD WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ALSO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UPFRONT COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION. THAT'S NOT. QUITE ACCURATE- WE HAVE- DATA ACCORDING TO THE FEE MINUS. THIRTY OF A OF A OF JUST THIS YEAR FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE HAVE DATA THAT INDICATES MANY BUILDINGS WILL EXPERIENCE NO OR YOU KNOW RELATIVELY VERY SMALL INCREASE- CONSTRUCTION COSTS TO MEET FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY BUILDING STANDARDS. AND OTHERS THAT WILL BE AS LITTLE AS OF BETWEEN ONE TO. 3% AS STATED IN THE FEW MINISTRY PORT IN FACT A RECENT AWARD WINNING A FOUR DOUBLE HOUSING PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS DESIGNED. AND CONSTRUCTED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED RECOVERY TIMES FOR LESS THAN HALF THE PERCENT POINT INCREASE. AGAIN ON PAGE FIVE THERE'S A STATEMENT REFERRING TO A PRESENTATION FROM THE CALVO CONFERENCE. WHICH IS AGAIN SOMEWHAT UT OF CONTEXT- A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ENVISIONS AN ENTIRELY NEW. IT READS- THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ENVISIONS AN ENTIRELY NEW DESIGN STANDARDS BASED ON RECENT AND ONGOING RESEARCH AND VETTED BY EXPERT COMMITTEES IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD TAKE TEN PLUS YEARS. THIS PART OF THE PRESENTATION HAS BEEN- TAKEN SOMEWHAT OUT OF CONTEXT AND IS NOT WHAT IS ENVISIONED BY EP THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. THE PRESENTATION AT THE COUPLE CONFERENCE WIZARD DISCUSSING HOW THE APPROACH TO FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY COULD BE EITHER. SIMPLE OR COMPREHENSIVE THE PROCESS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL IS THE SIMPLE VERSION BECAUSE IT JUST ASKS. A B. S. C. THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO GO FORWARD AND DO THIS RATHER HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. TO DO IT AND AT A GREATER COST AND ALSO GREATER TIMELINE- SO WITH THAT A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE IS- CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AND- THE SAME REPORT BY FEMALENESS. AND WILL GIVE US THE BUILDING CODES THAT REFLECT OUR SHARED PRIORITIES AND NEEDS IN TERMS OF SAFETY AND RECOVERY HAVING BUILDINGS SUFFERED DAMAGE THAT WILL REQUIRE COSTLY REPAIRS AND LENGTHY DOWNTIME. UNTIL THOSE REPAIRS ARE MADE WILL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THOSE REPAIRS AND FOURTEEN MAKE. TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR HOUSING EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE REPAIRS ARE MADE- A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE HELPS TO SET HIGHER STANDARDS FOR RECOVERY BASED PERFORMANCE. THAT WILL HELP PROTECT THESE COMMUNITIES FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EARTHQUAKES WITH ME IS. RYAN KERSTING A- LICENSE CALIFORNIA STRUCTURAL ENGINEER WHO IS TODAY REPRESENTING THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WHO HAS. ALSO BEEN THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS FOR THE RECENTLY RELEASED FEDERAL REPORT ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBER AND- MR RANCOR STING- YOU MAY PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY FROM THE GALLERY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE I AM RYAN KERSTING APRAKSIN STRUCTURAL HERE SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS. OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE EXPERTS WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING EARTHQUAKE PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS. THE PANDEMIC WILDFIRE AND OTHER HAZARD OFFENSIVE TAUGHT US ABOUT THE RECOVERY AND ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE RECOVERY. IN THE PANDEMIC MANY OF THESE SERVICES HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE TITLE IS ESSENTIAL. BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR BUILDING CODES MANY OF THOSE SAME BUILDINGS ARE NOT BEING DESIGNED AS SUCH. WE HAVE SEEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE BUILDINGS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER UNDER THE CURRENT CODE SUCH BUILDINGS WOULD LIKELY BE CLOSE FOR MANY MONTHS AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE IN ORDER TO BE REPAIRED. IF NOT FULLY REVEALS BEFORE BEING RE OPENS. THE RECENTLY RELEASED FEDERAL REPORT RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR AN EFFECTIVE PURGES STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PURSUE FUNCTION RECOVERY STANDARDS IN THEIR BUILDING CODES. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS CALLING FOR. THERE'S A CONSENSUS ACROSS THE BREADTH OF THE INDUSTRY GROUPS-AND WITHIN VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENTS. THAT WE SHOULD BE DESIGNER BUILDINGS RECOVERY NOT JUST SAFETY. WE HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND STATE AGENCIES ASKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE FOR THEIR BUILDINGS ALREADY. HOWEVER WE NEED YOUR HELP TO ESTABLISH A PATH FOR US TO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION. TO FURTHER THE CONVERSATION AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE. AS A SIMILAR MENTIONED THERE IS A SIMPLE APPROACH THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF PROVISIONS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO US THAT WILL NOT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE EFFORT BY THE STATE AGENCIES. LIKEWISE A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE IS NOT EXPECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A BILL. AND ECHOED THE PRIORITIZING BUILDINGS IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY NEED TO BE FUNCTIONAL AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. WE KNOW HOW TO DO BETTER. BUT NOW WE ACTUALLY NEED TO START TO DO BETTER. HELP US MAKE THIS CHANGE WHAT THE STATE DESERVES THE ARGUS PRADA SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. WE REQUEST AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU.
