BUT TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT UP THE SPILLED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. MAKE CAMERA BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT GOOD EVENING AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHERE A TOP ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN SUPPORT? KELSEY BURN BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ORANGE COUNTY SPONSOR TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHERS. SING THAN ANY IT UP IN OPPOSITION. SING NONE OF DO ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION TO STRIKE AT ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY XIN YES. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M USE TO FINANCING IN BONDS YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN A% COUNCIL MEMBER BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. SO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PAYING BACK INVESTED IN THE AND INVESTORS SPECIFIC RETURN JUST REPAYMENT. OF THAT PUT OUT TO BUILD THE STRUCTURES THAT. ORDER. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. SO HOW WOULD IT ACTUALLY HOPE WE'RE WITH THE MONEY COME FROM TO PAY BACK THE DEBT I MEAN THE HOMELESS PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T PAY THERE MUST BE SOMEONE PAYING INTO. I'LL TAKE A QUICK WHACK AT IT IN THEN ASK OF CHRIS MARINO WHO'S FROM THE CITY OF ANAHEIM. TO CHIME IN. THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THE GOVERNMENT'S WHO WILL FORM THE JPA -- IDEALLY UP TO THIRTY FOUR CITIES WHICH ORANGE COUNTY HOUSE. THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT THE THIRTY FOUR CITIES AND PRIVATE SECTOR. A PHILANTHROPIST IN ORANGE COUNTY HAVE SIGNALED THEIR INTENT TO INVEST FUNDS IN THE EFFORT. BUT THE EXACT PAY BACK MECHANISM I'M NOT SURE. OF THAT THAT'S ALL PUT TOGETHER YET. KELSEY BREWER DID A LOT OF THE WORK TO PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER SHE'S FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY CITIES. LET ME GIVE UP COUNCILWOMAN MURRAY A CHANCE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AS WELL AND THEN MISS BREWER. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CREATING A CENTRALIZED FUNDING MECHANISM SO THAT WHEN CITIES AND CITIES WILL BE ABLE TO OPT IN OR NOT BE FORCED INTO A SO. VERY OFTEN WITH PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH EMERGENCY SHELTERS THERE IS A FUNDING GAP THIS WILL HELP TO CLOSE THAT GAP SIMPLICITY HOUSING ENTITLED. PROJECT BUT IS SHORT SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING THAN THEY CAN APPLY TO THE JPA AND IF IT MEETS ALL THE PARAMETERS. THEN THEY COULD SEEK THAT FUNDING IT WILL. IT'S LIMITED GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR GENERAL CITY SERVICES THAT COULD COME TO HEAR IT WILL ALSO CREATE THAT CENTRALIZE FUNDING POOL WERE PRIVATE SECTOR INTERESTS CAN PUT THEIR RESOURCES KNOWING THEY'RE GOING TO CONSTRUCTIVE PROJECTS. SO WILL BE ABLE TO GET MORE CHARITABLE GIVING FROM ALL OF OUR A BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHO SIGNALED THEY WANT TO GET BEEN GIVEN AND GENEROUSLY TO THE SOUTH. FOR HEALTH IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO THIS TECHNICAL ENSURE. I'M SO I THINK I'M THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHRIS COVERED IT VERY VERY WHILE OUR INTENT HERE IS TO BRING AND PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS AND BETTER ALIGN THE THIRTY FOUR CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY TO GO IN A COORDINATED EFFORT TO SACRAMENTO. TO RECEIVE THE STATE FUNDING THAT YOU ALL HAVE GRACIOUSLY MADE AVAILABLE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. PACIFIC EARLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION REGARDING BONDING IF IN THE FUTURE THE COUNTY OR ANOTHER CD WANTED TO CONTRACT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS. WE WANTED TO SET UP THE GP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE BARNABA DOLLARS HOWEVER WHERE OVER IN THE SENATE -- THEY HAD VERY SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND WE CLEANED UP THAT LANGUAGE TIGHTLY FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE CONNECTED WE CAN'T JUST BOND AGAINST NOTHING LAW AND THERE HAS TO BE A STRONG FINANCE DREAM WE'D BE ABLE TO PROVE -- ALSO SOLD MAYBE AS ARE THE BUT I JUST THINK AS A BUSINESS PERSON. INVESTING IN THAT. WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO GET HOME TAX BENEFITS HOME ANY CALL OF THE IRS POSSIBLY YEAH. POSSIBLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO IT THE OTHER QUESTION IS THE SUPPORT OF PART OF THE HOUSING WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- HOW WOULD THAT WOULD THAT BE WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN A HOW IS THAT FUNDED THROUGH THE SAME BOND? ARE AS AN OPERATIONAL BOND OR IS IT. A DIFFERENT POT OF MONEY A LEAD KELSEY WHO DID MOST OF THE SITE I WORK ON THE ANSWER. JUST THAT IT IT WOULDN'T ALL BE BOND FINANCING THE MANY CASES WE HAVE FUNNY THAT SEE THERE'S LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL AND THERE'S JUST A GAP THAT'S NOT A WHERE THE COUNTY CAN PULL. ALL OF ITS RESOURCES AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY -- WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN TO GIVE TO THIS AS WELL WANT TO GIVE TO HELP CREATE. A SOLUTION FOR PARENTS SUPPORT HOUSING THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GIVE THE DOLLARS AND BE ASSURED THAT PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND SO. IT WILL ALLOW US TO CAPTURE ALL THOSE CABINET COUNTING A PRIVATE CAPITAL DOLLARS AS WELL -- BUT THAT BEING SAID IT IT'S IT IT PROVIDES BASICALLY A MENU OF OPTIONS FOR CITIES TO PULL FROM TO CREATE THESE PROJECTS BUT THERE IS AN ONGOING EFFORT BETWEEN ACC OF SEEING THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THOSE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS WE'VE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE NEEDED IN ORANGE COUNTY. ARE ALLOCATED IN A WAY THAT IS TRULY DISPERSED ACROSS THE COUNTY AND SO EVERY CITY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH A C. CO SEE TO PUT FOR THE NUMBER OF UNITS THEY WILL COMMIT. TO BUILDING BUT WE STILL HAVE A FUNDING GAP THAT MANY CITIES ARE FACING PARTICULAR SMALLER CITIES AND SO THIS IS THAT POOL OF FUNDING WITH VACANT APPEAL AND AND AND GET THAT ASSISTANCE AND THEN THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO THAT SPECIFICALLY ON THE SERVICES. YOU WILL NOTICE AND THE LANGUAGE THERE ARE NO REFERENCES TO SERVICES NOT BECAUSE A BEFORE FOUR EIGHT IS ALL ABOUT THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. HOWEVER PERMITS PART OF HOUSING DOES NOT WORK AND MUST WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE PRESENT. AND SO OUR VISION FOR A BEFORE FOR A IN THE HOUSING TRUST IS THAT THOSE SERVICES WILL STILL RESIDE WITH THE COUNTY THAT IS THE COUNTIES CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE THOSE SOCIAL SERVICES. BUT THE CITIES HAVE THE LAND USE AUTHORITY MISS CHRIS I AM VERY ACUTELY POINTED OUT. THE PROBLEM IS THE CITIES DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS AB FOUR FOUR EIGHT IS ABOUT A CAPITAL FINANCE PLAN TO CLOSE THIS FINANCIAL GAPS OR WEAKENED PROCRIT THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION. A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN PARTNERSHIP. AND WORKING WITH. EVEN FOR EXISTING EMERGENCY SHELTERS THAT WE'VE BUILT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE ASPECT. THANK YOU. FURTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE.

THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH SHARE GOOD EVENING TO YOU. AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOU PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY IT'S A MEASURE THAT. HIGH IS A DIFFERENT BILL ODDLY ENOUGH A FOUR CITY IN MY DISTRICT BERKELEY -- AND FOR CITY -- THE SAID NEIGHBOR -- FOR PLASTER COUNTY -- WHICH IS THAT. SIMILARITY IN NATURE TO A THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW VOTERS IN PLASTER COUNTY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO INCREASE TAXES. TO HELP IMPROVE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. OF THE BILL ALSO WOULD GIVE VOTERS IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPROVE OF A LOCAL TAX INCREASE. TO HELP ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND THE FUN OTHER SERVICES BUT IF APPROVED BY VOTERS IN PLASTER COUNTY THE TAX WILL INCREASE BY NO MORE. THAN 1% TO ADDRESS THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY. UP THIS BILL WILL GRANT LOCAL CONTROL OVER TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN THE AREA. OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS GRANTED SIMILAR TAX AUTHORITY. IN THE PAST INCLUDING TO SEVERAL COUNTIES. TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES ON BEHALF OF THESE TWO COMMUNITIES THAT SEEK TO IMPROVE. THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THEIR CITIZENS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. TWENTY NINE TWENTY A WITH ME TODAY THROUGHOUT ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IS JILL CHOICE REPRESENTING PLASTER COUNTY AND NICKELODEON LUKA REPRESENTING THE CITY OF BERKELEY WELCOME GENTLEMEN. IT DIDN'T IN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MY NAME STILL CHOICE THE PLASTIC COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICE FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CITY OF BERKELEY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN FOR INCLUDING. AYE LANGUAGE WITHIN THEIR BELT. BRIEFLY THE NORTH LAKE TAHOE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WAS CREATED IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE. TO COMBINED COMBINED PARTS OF TO TRANSPORTATION DISTRICTS WITHIN THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN. PLUS A COUNTY TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT AS WELL AS TRADE A TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY. IT WAS TO ALLOW FOR SALES TAX INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES WITHIN THE REGION. AND THAT'S REGION IS UNIQUE IN PLASTIC COUNTY IN THAT IT'S A DESTINATION COMMUNITY WITH A FAIRLY LARGE AMOUNT OF TOURISM AND AS SUCH TRANSPORTATION DEMANDS ARE DIFFERENT. PLUS A COUNTY IS LOOKING TO REVISE THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF TRANSPORTATION TO INCLUDE MULTI MODAL FORMS OF TRANSIT SUCH AS TRAILS. AND BUSES. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS PLUS A COUNTIES BEEN WORKING WITH MANY COMMUNITY GROUPS TO EXPAND OUR TRAIL NETWORK. TO INCLUDE CONNECTIVITY IN THE NORTH LAKE TAHOE BASIN ALL THE WAY TO TRUCKEE AS WAS ACTIVELY EXPANDING A TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. TO INCREASE HEADWAYS EXPANDING BUS ROUTES INCREASING SHUTTLE SERVICE. THE REVISED LANGUAGE WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE ON THIS PATH ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AS WELL AS DEMANDS ON INFRASTRUCTURE PLACED ON THE COMMUNITY THROUGH VISITATION. WE HAVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SUPPORT FOR MANY OF OUR LOCAL SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE NORTH LAKE TAHOE RESORT ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS THE LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NICOLO DELUDE HERE WE HAVE THE CITY OF BERKLEY WILL BE VERY BRIEF ONE I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FALLS WITH LEADERSHIP ON THIS. AGAIN THIS IS ONLY TO INCREASE THE CABIN IS NOT TO RAISE THE TAXES OF VOTERS WILL GO OUT NOVEMBER ON THIS ISSUE. IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL THE MONEY WILL GO TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IN BERKELEY WHICH WE'VE HAD A BIG UPTICK. LOCAL POLICE HIRING TO BEEF UP THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEN TO BEEF UP OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE BERKELEY IS ONE OF THE FEW CITIES THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THAT. APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIMES STAFF TIME AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. TALK ABOUT AND SHARE THE MEMBERS HAVE A LITTLE SALAS POTTER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAHOE LINES IN STRONG SUPPORT WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SING NINE THOSE IN OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD EVENING DAVID WILL FOOT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- TODAY MEMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY AUTHORIZATION AND AGAIN THIS IS AN AUTHORIZATION AND NOT A TAX INCREASES IT AS HAS BEEN STATED IT DOES AUTHORIZED A TAX INCREASE. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE AUTHORIZATIONS AS WE HAVE BEEN FOR A NUMBER YEARS NOW. WORRY THIS TO BE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WHERE THE VOTERS TO APPROVE THIS BERKELEY'S OVERALL SALES TAX RATE WOULD BE NINE POINT 75%. THERE'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR MUNICIPALITIES MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA 5% THAT MUNICIPALITIES IN THE STATE. THAT HAVE A SALES TAX THAT HIGH OR HIGHER -- SO WERE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED WE'RE DEALING WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE TAX INCREASE THAT'S APPROACHING 10% -- YOU KNOW HIGHER THAN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA OR ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND MEMBERS ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED. FOR THERE IS NO GUARANTEE. THAT THE FUNDING IN THIS BILL WILL BE USED FOR HOMELESSNESS OR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES AND MEMBERS WE KNOW THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES A SPECIAL TAX. IT COULD AUTHORIZE THE GENERAL TAX. OUR CONCERN WITH THESE TAX AUTHORIZATIONS AS REUBEN CONCERN WITH THEM FOR A NUMBER YEARS IT'S THAT THE MONEY IS SIMPLY GOING TO GO TO UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES. THE CITY OF BERKELEY CURRENTLY HAS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOT UNLIKE OTHER CITIES THAT ALL OF YOU REPRESENT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES IF IT'S A GENERAL TAX NOTHING PROHIBITS THE MONEY FROM BEING USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES -- AND NOT FOR THE ONE STATED IN THE BILL OR BY THE AUTHOR SO FOR THOSE I THINK VERY VALID REASONS WE ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYA OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SING NEITHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SOME MEMBER CARILLO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE JPA. AND IT'S IT BASICALLY WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHO WAS IN SUPPORT -- OF THE BELL -- THIS IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND SO -- APPRECIATE THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS BUT NONE OF THEM SEND HIM LETTERS OF SUPPORT IT THAT -- THERE AT LEAST NOT REFLECTED HERE THERE WERE ANY CITIES. THAT -- ARE NOT PART OF THE JPA AND IF THAT WAS PURPOSEFUL. I JUST WASN'T SURE WITH THE AREA THE DISTANCE WITH THIS IS THAT THE JPA AND THAT. TAHOE -- JUST SPEAKING OF THE NORTH LIKE TALK TRANSPORTATION THIRTY AREN'T THERE THE TO THE AREA THAT WE'RE COVER AND THERE ARE NO CITIES -- WITHIN THE WITHIN THAT -- AREA OKAY ON BUT WE DO HAVE A LOCAL PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICTS ARE SUPPORTIVE SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT THERE THERE THIS SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS PART OF IT CORRECT OKAY. GOT IT OKAY AND I I WAS JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE. LIKE NO CITIES BUT WILL GET THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY LIKE US BETTER. JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION THAT. WAS. WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TO THINK IF. BUT SUSAN WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE -- WE WILL. PROJECTED CLOSE I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I LIKE TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER WOLF -- FROM THE HOWARD JARVISTAXES THOSE ASIAN AND LIKE TO PUT YOUR MIND AT REST THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS MEASURE. ON THAT SPEAKS TO PENSION LIABILITY -- THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS MEASURE THAT WOULD AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT EITHER OF THESE ARM FINE AND UPSTANDING JURISDICTIONS WOULD DO ANYTHING OTHER. THAN WHAT THEY'VE ASKED TO DO THEIR FOR THEIR VOTERS OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR VOTERS TO DECIDE IF THEY WISH TO TAX THEMSELVES. IN THE SAME WAY THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY DONE AND BEEN GIVEN THE SAME WAIVER. TO DO SO ON BY THIS LEGISLATURE WERE ASKING THAT THERE BE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED FOR THE CITY OF BERKELEY AND FOR THE JPA THE NORTH LAKE TAHOE AREA SO THEY CONSERVE THEIR CITIZENS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FILE WILL BE SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR TAKING ON THE PLUS OR THE LAKE TAHOE TRIP NORTH LAKE TAHOE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY.
