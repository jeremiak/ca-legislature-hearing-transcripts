00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.618
THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.620
HISTORY OF POLICE REFORM. IN

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.155
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ARGUABLY

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.857
THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A HISTORY

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:21.459
OF POLICE REFORM IN FAVOR OF

IN REALITY THAT'S WHY WE'RE

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:26.897
HERE- THAT'S WHY WE DEALT IN

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:27.865
THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH SOME

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.401

BILL WE'VE BEEN STARTING TO AT

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.516
LEAST LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. BUT

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:46.917
IT DOESN'T COME QUICK ENOUGH

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.719
FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.588
SO THE URGENCY OF THIS MATTER

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:53.224
IS ESSENTIAL AND I'M GLAD WE'RE

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.792
HERE AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.460
BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND I

00:39:56.527 --> 00:40:00.965
WAS DISAPPOINTED LAST YEAR. AT

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:03.667
WHAT I SAW ON JUDICIARY A BILL

ON ON PLEASE DECERTIFICATION

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.271
BUT I THINK WE CRITICALLY NEED

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.773
WE CRITICALLY HAVE TO TALK

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.275
ABOUT THE FACT. THAT THERE HAS

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:13.477
TO BE A WAY TO DECERTIFY BAD

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:15.212
COPS AND CLAPS THOUGHT SO TOO

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:17.815
THE UNIONS SAID THEY AGREED.

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:19.884
AND YET- WE COULDN'T GET TO A

QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED AND

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.190
SOME HOLES WERE WERE FILLED- I

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:27.324
HOPE FOR ABLE TO DO THAT

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:29.093
BECAUSE I THINK WE WILL HAVE

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.362
FAILED OUR RESPONSIBILITY IF WE

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.062

OUR COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MR

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.362
LACKEY AND ALSO- COLLEAGUES OF

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.464
OURS WHO- COME FROM COMMUNITIES

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.632
OF COLOR WHO HAD VERY DIFFERENT

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:42.433
EXPERIENCES WITH LAW

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:44.368
ENFORCEMENT- WAS ONE OF THE

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.870
MOST PROFOUND AND MOVING.

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.004
MOMENTS THAT I'VE HAD IN MY

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.839
SHORT TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE-

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.308
I FOUND THAT TO BE A VERY VERY

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:51.876
MOVING DAY IN AN IMPORTANT

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:54.211
CONVERSATION AND THEN CERTAINLY

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.946
HAVE THAT FOLLOWED UP BY THE

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.848
EVENTS THAT WE WITNESSED- OVER

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:58.716
THE SUMMER WITH THAT WITH THE

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.818
BRUTAL KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:01.919
AND THIS PROFOUND NATIONAL

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.721
MOMENT THAT WE'VE HAD. ON OWN

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.389
RECKONING OF ISSUES AND RACE

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.458
AND JUSTICE THE CONCLUSION THAT

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.859
I REALLY CAME TO AND I THINK A

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.327
LOT OF FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.228
CAME TO IS THAT THERE'S SYSTEM

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:13.097
SYSTEMIC CHANGES NEEDED IN THIS

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:13.864
COUNTRY ON ISSUES OF RACE AND

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.600
JUSTICE-AND NOT CERTAINLY GOES

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.202
ACROSS THE HALL IS- A RANGE OF

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.304
ISSUES FROM FROM EDUCATION TO

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:23.240
HEALTH CARE TO OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:23.841
ALL OF THESE. DIFFERENT ISSUE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:24.575
THAT WE EXAMINE THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.210
BUT POLICING IS CERTAINLY A

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.378
CRITICAL PART OF THAT

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:28.812
CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.681
THERE REALLY IS A DEMAND. FOR

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.815
CHANGING FOR CONVERSATION

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:33.717
AROUND THIS AND SO I AM LOOKING

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.219
FORWARD TO THIS SELECT

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.186
COMMITTEE VERY MUCH I THINK

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.755
IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:38.389
ONE I'M LOOKING FOR TO

LISTENING AND LEARNING- HEARING

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.526
FOR THE PERSPECTIVES OF THESE

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.028
PERCENT PRESENTERS AND THEN

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:45.496
HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD AS AS

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:46.530
OUR OUR COLLEAGUE SAID WITH A

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:47.865
SENSE OF URGENCY AND I THINK

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:48.999
THAT THIS IS WORK THAT THE

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.267
PEOPLE DEMAND. THAT THE PEOPLE

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.268
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAN

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:52.069
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.771
THAT WE CAN APPROACH THIS WITH

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:56.507
NUANCE WITH- WITH CLARITY AND

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:57.841
UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.310
ISSUES APPLY- AND HOPEFULLY

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.978
MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY WE CAN

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:01.612
GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:02.613
GET IT RIGHT I THINK THAT'S

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.580
WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.549
ARE DEMANDING OF US AND SO- THE

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.084
CERTAINLY A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.352

POLICE OFFICER REFORM AND I

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.749
DIALOGUE. AND CERTAINLY I'M

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.351
LOOKING FORWARD TO ONE- NOT DO

RENT WINDOW DRESSING BUT

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.155

BEGIN. YOUR COMMENTS. YOUR

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.770
COMMENTS. HELLO MY NAME IS

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:42.038
PETER HANNAH I AM RESIDENT OF

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:44.274
THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. AND A

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.009
NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.310
I'M A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:49.346
AND CRIMINOLOGY AT CAL POLY

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:53.216
POMONA. I FOCUS ON POLICING- MY

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:54.684
RESEARCH FOCUSES ON POLICE

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:58.321
CITIZEN INTERACTIONS RACE AND

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:03.894
POLICE USE OF FORCE. WHEN YOU

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.295
LOOK BACK AT THE LAST FEW

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:07.631
DECADES OF POLICE REFORM IN

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.866
UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. WE

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:12.035
MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CONCLUDE.

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:14.371
BUT NOTHING WORKS. AFTER ALL

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:16.139
EVERY SINGLE CYCLE OF POLICE

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.307
REFORM SEEMS TO FOLLOW A

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.976
SIMILAR PATTERN. WE GET SOME

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:20.677
KIND OF CRISIS EVENT THAT

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:24.014
OCCURS WITH CALLS FOR REFORM.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.316
WE GET A CALL HOME AFTER THOSE

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:28.151
REFORMS AND THEN THERE'S

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:30.921
ANOTHER CRISIS EVENT. AND WE

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:32.422
FIND OURSELVES NOW IN A SIMILAR

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:36.393
MOMENT. ARE THE VOICES WHO SAY

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.361
THAT NOTHING WORKS RIGHT I

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.497
DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:41.097
THAT WE NEED TO BE PESSIMISTIC

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:43.033
ABOUT THAT. ARE WE DOOMED TO

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.868
KEEP REPEATING THE SAME CYCLE

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.871
OF CRISIS REFORM PALM NEW

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.841
CRISIS. I DON'T THINK SO BUT I

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:51.475
THINK IT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:54.010
OUT OF THIS PATTERN. WE NEED TO

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.179
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. AND

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.148
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY. I THINK

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.282
IT'S CUTE BUT WE'RE NOT

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.518
ACTUALLY DOING THE SAME THING

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:03.520
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.655
RATHER THE PATTERN THAT WE SEE

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:07.257
IS MORE LIKE THE SWINGING OF

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:10.293
THE PENDULUM. WHERE WE MOVE

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.230
FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER. AND

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.598
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:17.033
PATH FORWARD TOWARDS POLICE

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:17.634
REFORM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.736
TO LOOK BACK. AND WHEN WE LOOK

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.271
BACK A TO MAKE SENSE OF THE

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.606
COMPLICATED HISTORY OF POLICE

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.608
REFORM I WANT TO FOCUS ON THREE

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:26.543
AREAS. WHICH I'M GONNA CALL

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:33.149
DISCRETION. DISTANCE AND DATA.

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:35.318
FIRST REGARDING DISCRETION AT

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:37.087
THE MOST BASIC LEVEL DISCRETION

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.455
IN THE CONTEXT OF POLICING JUST

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.156
REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF TRUST

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:42.526
THAT WE GIVE TO POLICE OFFICERS

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:43.660
TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS THE

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:46.897
TENSION THIS PENDULUM SWING

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:47.531
THAT I DESCRIBE WITHIN

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:50.267
DISCRETION ARE THE IMPOSITION

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:53.136
OF STRICT RULES. VERSUS TOTAL

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:55.005
DEFERENCE TO POLICE OFFICER

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.941
JUDGMENT. AND WE SEEM TO SWING

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.976
BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES.

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:01.444
BETWEEN ANY APPLICATION OF

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.079
STRICT RULES WHICH GIVE ZERO

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:06.917
DISCRETION. TWO MORE DEFERENCE

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:07.450
WHICH GIVES MAYBE TOO MUCH

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:11.187
DISCRETION. AND IN THIS TENSION

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.722
BETWEEN THOSE ARE THE EXAMPLE I

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:14.124
LIKE TO USE MY STUDENTS WHEN WE

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.692
TALK ABOUT DISCRETION IS THE

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.527
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRY COOK

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.829
AND A BRAIN SURGEON. WHEN YOU

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.264
LOOK AT THE JOB OF A FRY COOK

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.232
WHAT DO THEY DO WELL IF YOU'RE

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.733
WORKING AT MCDONALD'S OR BURGER

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.534
KING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CUT THE

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.303
FRIES A PARTICULAR WITH. YOU

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:27.404
PUT IT IN THE FRYER FOR A

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.005
PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SECONDS

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.006
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR DONE

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:31.508
YOU DO THREE SHAKES OF SALT AND

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.077
THEN THAT'S IT. OBVIOUSLY THAT

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:35.612
KIND OF STRICT RULE BASED

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.847
PROCESS. IS INAPPROPRIATE

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.716
WITHIN THE- WITHIN A CONTEXT.

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:41.184
AS DIFFICULT AND DYNAMIC AS

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.487
POLICING. FORMER LA POLICE LAPD

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.323
POLICE CHIEF CHARLIE BECK WAS

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.258
FOND OF SAYING IF WE WANTED TO

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.360
DO TOMORROW WE COULD END A

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:51.861
DRIVERS DISTRACTED WITH CELL

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:53.663
PHONES IN THE CAR. THE PROBLEM

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.799
IS WITH THAT'S THE ONLY THING

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:58.034
WE WOULD BE DOING. IF WE WANTED

00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:59.302
TO EVERY SINGLE TIME A POLICE

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.236
OFFICER SEES SOMEONE ON THE

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:01.605
PHONE IN THE CAR THEY COULD

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:02.973
PULL THEM OVER BUT THEN THEY

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:03.940
WOULDN'T BE PULLING OVER THE

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.308
DRUNK DRIVERS WOULD BE PULLING

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.743
OVER THE PEOPLE SPEEDING. WOULD

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.445
BE PULLING OVER THE PEOPLE WHO

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:10.046
MAYBE WE ARE ACTUALLY MORE

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:12.349
CONCERNED ABOUT. ULTIMATELY SO

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.383
MUCH OF POLICING IS ABOUT

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.085
MAKING DECISIONS WERE GIVEN A

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.087
NARROW RANGE OF OPTIONS AND

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:19.289
DISCRETION. IS HOW POLICE

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.391
OFFICERS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:22.726
AND IF WE CONSTRAIN DIRECTION

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.828
TOO MUCH. THEN WE RISK A BAD

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:28.398
OUTCOMES. AT THE SAME TIME WHEN

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.233
WE SEE THESE ABUSES WHEN WE SEE

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.736
THESE CASES OF CRISES OF TRUST

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:35.105
AND LEGITIMACY. OUR NATURAL

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:36.306
INCLINATIONS TO SWING TO THE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.708
OTHER EXTREME IN TO SAY OKAY

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.777
WHAT WE NEED TO IMPOSE.

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:44.080
BOUNDARIES ON POLICE DISCRETION

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:45.015
BUT UNFORTUNATE THE WAY WE TEND

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:46.816
TO DO THAT. IS WELL I'M A

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.752
LAWYER AND MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.854
LAWYERS TO WE ACT LIKE LAWYERS.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.922
THAT WE IMPOSE REASON THE BILL

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.324
OF THE TESTS. AND WE SAY WHAT

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.992
WHAT A REASONABLE OFFICER TO

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.927
WHAT'S A REASONABLE USE OF FOR

00:54:57.994 --> 00:55:00.363
USE OF FORCE. AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.935
A AS WE ALL KNOW. SO FEW OF OUR

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:06.536
POLICE OFFICERS ARE LAWYERS.

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.004
AND IF WAY THAT WE'RE ATTEMPT.

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.606
TO IMPOSE THIS. IF THE WAY

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:10.140
THEIR ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:12.876
DISCRETION. IS TO ASK POLICE

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.144
OFFICERS TO BECOME

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.346
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS. TO DO

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:17.814
THE THINGS THAT THE SUPREME

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.716
COURT ITSELF IS RELUCTANT TO DO

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:22.085
WHERE ENGRAM VERSUS CONNOR IT

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:23.787
SAYS THAT POLICE USE OF FORCE

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.789
MUST BE REASONABLE. WELL WHAT'S

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.624
REASONABLE MEANS. WHO IS THE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.792
REASONABLE MAN WHO IS THE

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.060
POLICE OFFICER WAS A REASONABLE

00:55:30.126 --> 00:55:32.162
POLICE OFFICER THESE ARE REALLY

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:35.298
TOUGH QUESTIONS. AND IS THAT

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:35.765
THE WAY THAT WE IMPOSE

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:39.803
DISCRETION. WE WILL WE SO IN

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:42.405
THIS TENSION BETWEEN THESE TWO

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:43.006
EXTREMES WE RISK LEARNING THE

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.741
WRONG LESSON IT'S NOT THE

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:47.210
DISCRETION IS BAD DISCRETION IS

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:49.212
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IT'S AN

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.381
IMPORTANT PART OF POLICING BUT

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:54.751
THERE HAVE TO BE LIMITS. THE

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:59.489
NEXT AREA IS DISTANCE. SO MUCH

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.091
OF THE TIME THE TENSION WHEN IT

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:03.259
COMES TO DISTANCE IS HOW CLOSE

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.961
SHOULD THE POLICE BE TO THE

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:05.462
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.864
POLICING. THE LESSON THAT WE

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:10.433
TOOK AWAY FROM THE EVENTS OF

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.535
THE NINETEEN NINETIES. REMOVE

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.270
THE FROM RODNEY KING AND THE EN

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:15.905
LA NINETY TWO SO MUCH OF THAT

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.907
WOULD THE TAKEAWAY WAS THAT

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:20.110
POLICE WERE OUTSIDERS AND WE

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.811
NEED TO REBUILD TRUST AND THE

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.347
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:24.848
AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:26.983
THEY'RE POLICING. AND SO THE

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.286
PENDULUM SWINGS CLOSER TO BEING

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:33.389
CLOSER TO THAT COMMUNITY. AND

00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:35.458
THE WAY THIS WAS SO OFTEN DONE

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.862
WAS THROUGH COMMUNITY POLICING.

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:39.796
NOT COMMITTEE PLACE IS A FUNNY

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.931
THING IF YOU IF YOU ASK A TEN

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.266
POLICE DEPARTMENTS- NINE OF

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.400
THEM WILL SAY THEY DO COMMUNITY

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.535
POLICING IT WILL GIVE YOU A

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:47.137
LEVIN DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:49.072
WHAT IT MEANS. CAN BE POLICING

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.540
IS VAGUE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE'S

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.809
IN FAVOR OF IT BUT NO ONE CAN

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:55.211
REALLY TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS.

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:55.912
WELL WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.514
COMPLETE COMMITTEE PLACING CAN

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.516
OFTEN BE A BABY IS WHEN IT'S AT

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:02.452
ITS BEST. IS INSTEAD OF TOP

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:03.787
DOWN IMPOSITION INSTEAD OF

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:05.755
POLICE DEPARTMENTS SAYING THIS

00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.423
IS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THESE

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.957
ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:10.326
CONCERNED ABOUT. IT'S REACHING

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:11.394
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY IN

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.830
DIALOGUE IN CONVERSATIONS AND

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.732
YOU TELL US. WHAT ARE THE AREAS

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.134
OF CONCERN YOU TELL US WHAT ARE

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.636
THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:22.272
UNSAFE YOU TELL US WHAT WE CAN

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:24.007
DO TO REBUILD THAT TRUST. AND

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:26.276
ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT WOULD BE

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:28.211
THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY MEETINGS.

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.112
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:30.880
ACTUALLY HAPPENS FAR TOO OFTEN

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.682
IN THOSE COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:34.818
WHAT THEY DEVOLVE INTO. IS

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.486
COMPLAINT SESSIONS WHERE THE

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.154
MEMBERS THE COMMUNITY COMPLAIN

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:38.888
TO THE POLICE OFFICER THE

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:41.024
POLICE. OFFICER STOICALLY TAKES

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.092
THAT ABUSE AND WALKS OUT AND

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.894
THE QUESTION IS WELL WHAT'S

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.496
GETTING DONE. WHAT'S COMING

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:49.265
FROM THAT. IT'S JUST A VENTING

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.501
SESSION THEN THAT'S NOT

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:51.968
ACTUALLY REPAIRING THE

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.870
RELATIONSHIP IT IS JUST A

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.972
VENTING SESSION WHERE NOT

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.640
THERE'S NO CONCRETE PROGRESS

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.576
AND THAT DOESN'T REBUILD TRUST

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.043
TO THE DOESN'T REBUILD

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:03.213
COMMUNITY. AND IN FACT- PERHAPS

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:05.882
MORE DANGEROUSLY. WHAT THE

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:07.750
CONCERNS RECENTLY HAVE BECOME.

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:08.918
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THESE

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.819
COMMITTEE COMES COMMITTEE

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.955
POLICING INSTEAD OF IT BEING

00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.890
THE COMMUNITY TELLING POLICE

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:16.826
DIRECTING OF POLICE AS TO WHAT

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.528
OUR INTERESTS ARE WHAT WHAT

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:19.529
ISSUES ARE OF INTEREST TO THE

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:20.997
COMMUNITY. TOO OFTEN BECOMES A

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:22.632
CHECK ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.267
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. WHERE

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.035
INSTEAD THEIR POLICE OFFICERS

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.103
IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.538
USING THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS TO

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.273
GATHER INFORMATION TO GATHER

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.542
INTELLIGENCE. BUT NOT BUT IT'S

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:36.746
NOT A TWO WAY STREET. ONCE

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:38.581
AGAIN WE RISK LEARNING THE

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:41.117
WRONG LESSON. CLOSENESS CAN BE

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.119
GOOD CLOSENESS CAN BE IMPORTANT

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.188
WHEN IT TAKES IN IT ESSENTIAL

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:49.225
FOR LEGITIMACY AND TRUST. BUT

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.227
WHEN POLICE USE THAT CLOSENESS.

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.228
AND PUT IN AND AGAIN THE

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.830
CONCERN HERE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.498
EVEN WHAT'S ACTUALLY OCCURRING

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:57.200
BUT WHAT WHAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:59.002
ARE PERCEIVING. IF COMMITTEE

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.337
MEMBERS PERCEIVE BUT THE ONLY

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:01.971
THING THESE MEETINGS ARE BEING

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:06.876
USED FOR IS FOR POLICE OFFICERS.

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:07.477
TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:07.977
ARRESTS. AS OPPOSED TO

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:08.778
LISTENING TO LISTENING TO

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:09.746
COMPLAINTS AND LISTENING TO

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:11.581
ISSUES THEN YOU RESTORE ROADING

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:14.350
THAT TRUST IN A ROADING THAT

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:18.888
LEGITIMACY. FINALLY DATA. ONE

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.790
OF THE GREAT REVOLUTIONS OF

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:21.324
POLICING IN THE NINETEEN

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:22.425
NINETIES WAS THE USE OF STE

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.260
SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL DATA

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:29.465
WAS THE RECOGNITION. THAT

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:30.033
INSTEAD OF GOING TO BLINDLY

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:30.600
GOING OUT FOR A WAITING FOR

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.302
RADIO THANK PLEASED MORE TO AND

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:33.970
MORE PROACTIVE IN THEIR

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:36.272
POLICING THAT'S THE LESSON THAT

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:37.407
WE LEARNED AND COMPSTAT IN NEW

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:41.110
YORK AND SERRA IN SAN DIEGO AND

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:41.711
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:44.814
COUNTRY. BUT THE CONCERN AGAIN

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.516
SO OFTEN IS WHAT IS THE DATA

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:49.819
USED FOR. IF THAT DATA WE SAY

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.020
OKAY WHERE WE CAN SEND THE

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:51.921
POLICE WERE GONNA SEND THE

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.022
WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE WELL

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.890
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE HOT

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:55.358
SPOTS ARE WHERE THE DATA TELLS

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.593
US THE HOT SPOTS ARE. HOW DO

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.494
YOU KNOW HOW DOES THE DATA WITH

00:59:58.561 --> 01:00:01.030
THE HOT SPOTS ARE WELL THAT'S

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.166
WERE MADE ARRESTS. WOULD YOU

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.234
RISK DOING IS LAUNDERING IN.

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:08.871
THE SAME KIND OF BIASES. AND

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.740
THE SAME KINDS OF PATTERNS. OF

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.575
DISCRIMINATORY POLICING THAT

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.477
MIGHT HAVE EXISTED BEFORE. IN

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.412
FACT IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:19.349
THAT YOU HAVE. EVERYONE IN A

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:19.983
POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE BEST

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.218
OF INTENTIONS. LOOKING AND

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.319
SAYING WELL I'M JUST DOING WHAT

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.254
THE DATE IS TELLING ME TO DO.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.056
NOT REALIZING THAT WHAT HAD

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.025
GOTTEN BAKED INTO THAT WOULD

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.259
GOTTEN BAKED INTO THE DATA

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.295
ANALYSIS. WITH THE SAME

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:34.364
PATTERNS OF THAT WE SAW IN THE

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.966
BATTLE DAYS. AT THE SAME TIME

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.368
THE RESPONSE TO THAT CAN'T BE

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.737
WILL GET RID OF DATA. IT IS

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.038
UNFORTUNATELY SI VAT HAPPENING

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:44.674
AS WELL. THAT WAS A SCANDAL IN

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.908
THE NEW YORK NEW YORK POLICE

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.444
DEPARTMENT A FEW YEARS AGO WITH

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.045
ADRIAN SCHOOLCRAFT WITH THIS

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:51.147
CONCERN ABOUT MANIPULATING THE

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.249
DATA IN ORDER TO MAKE CRIME

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:53.816
STATISTICS LOOK BETTER THAN

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.918
THEY WERE. FOR AND THAT'S THE

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.220
CONCERN WE ALSO SEE WITH THE

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.956
FACT THAT NONE OF US NONE OF US

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.657
CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A GOOD

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.159
NUMBER AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:04.694
ARE KILLED BY THE POLICE EVERY

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.462
YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. WE

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:09.198
HAVE ESTIMATES. BUT NONE OF US

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:10.800
ACTUALLY KNOW WHY BECAUSE WE

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:12.602
DON'T HAVE THE DATA SHOULDN'T

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.537
WE HAVE THE DATA FOR THAT.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.571
THERE ARE SOME THINGS OUR DATA

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.840
IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR AND

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.742
THE SOLUTION CAN'T BE TOO TO

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.645
IGNORE THE DATA. WE NEED MORE

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:24.347
DATA DATA IS ACTUALLY ONE OF

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.282
THESE REFORMS THAT IS CAPACITY

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.584
BUILDING. BECAUSE BY GETTING

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:30.953
GOOD DATA WHAT WE CAN DO. IS

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.889
MAKE BETTER REFORMS THE FUTURE

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.924
BECAUSE WE CAN INFORM WHAT

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.592
THOSE REFORM SHOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.493
YOU WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S A

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.929
PATTERN OF RACIAL PROFILING YOU

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:40.430
WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.497
ACTUALLY A PATTERN. OF DRIVING

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:43.933
WHILE BLACK. WHEN YOU NEED THE

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.803
DATA TO PROVE THAT. AND IF YOU

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:51.574
DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON WHAT.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:52.175
WHO YOU'RE STOPPING WHY YOU'RE

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:52.775
STOPPING THEM WHAT HAVE ONCE

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:55.478
YOU STOP THEM IS AN ARREST MADE

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.679
WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR THE

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.515
ARREST WHAT HAPPENS LONG TERM.

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:00.583
WHAT WAS THE CONTEXT OF THE

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.585
ARREST ALL OF THAT INFORMATION

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:03.453
IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:06.055
CALIFORNIA HAS DONE GREAT WORK

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:06.689
IN RECENT YEARS IN GETTING MORE

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.659
DATA. BUT THE SOLUTION HAS TO

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:12.562
BE TO KEEP GOING. BECAUSE WE

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.663
DON'T MAKE PROGRESS IF WE DON'T

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:17.733
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. SO

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.102
DEPENDENT TO WRAP UP BUT WHAT

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.336
I'D SAY IS A I'M TEACHING A

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:23.573
CLASS RIGHT NOW ON THE HISTORY

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:24.073
OF AFTER THE HISTORY OF

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.441
POLICING WE JUST WRAPPED UP

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:25.975
TALKING WITH THE KERNER

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.143

LIKE IT COULD BE HAPPENING NOW.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.192
AND I THINK THAT CAN BE A CAUSE

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.595
FOR PESSIMISM. IT CAN BE A

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.964
CAUSE FOR PESSIMISM TO SAY

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.798

SO IMPORTANT TO THIS ISSUE OF

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.910
POLICE REFORM AND I'M GOING TO

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.379

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.180

TODAY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE

AND WHAT I SEE- BUT I THINK

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.521
WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.455
IMPORTANT LOOK AT THIS RIGHT

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.556
NOW IS THERE'S OFTEN TO TALK

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.592
ABOUT REIMAGINING POLICING BUT

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.594
IN MANY WAYS I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.429
IMAGINE POLICING IN THE WAY

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.131
THAT BOTH HISTORY AND COMMUNITY

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:38.034
HAS EXPECTATIONS. THERE ARE

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:38.801
MANY THINGS THAT PROFESSOR

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:39.835
HANNAH COULD MENTION ABOUT

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.504
DISCRETION DISTANCE AND DATA

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.306
THAT EVEN TALKED ABOUT FOR MANY

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:47.476
MANY YEARS. BUT THE ONE THEME

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:48.044
THAT YOU WILL SEE IN MOST.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.545
HISTORY OF. AND REFORM IS THE

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.180
IDEA OF HAVING A PROFESSIONAL

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.716
WORK FORCE AND PROFESSIONALISM.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.318
IN POLICING. BOTH ON THE

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.019
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ON THE AGENCY

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.554
AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.423
CERTAINLY ON THE REGULATORY AND

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.425
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK. THAT THE

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.527
LEGISLATURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.595
THE PUBLIC EXPECTS AND DESERVES

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.497
PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.566
BUT UNFORTUNATELY OFTENTIMES

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.035
THE STANDARDS THE STRUCTURES

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.403
AND ALL TOO OFTEN THE BEHAVIOR

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.504
OF OFFICERS. LACKS THAT

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.506
PROFESSIONALISM. I'VE BEEN VERY

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:18.741
HONOR TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.009
INCREDIBLE PROFESSIONALS AND

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.310
LAW ENFORCEMENT BOTH AT THE

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.012
FEDERAL LEVEL. WITH THE F. B.

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.013
I. U. S. SECRET SERVICE AND

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.548
OTHERS. THE MILITARY CRIMINAL

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.383
INVESTIGATIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.784
THEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:29.919
POLICE OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.454
UNITED STATES. AND IN

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.188
PARTICULAR MY TIME AT THE L. A.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.623
P. D. WHICH IS HALLMARK HAS

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.157
ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.093
PROFESSIONALISM FROM. ITS

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:39.195
REFORMS THAT IS INSTITUTED AND

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:40.162
I MET AND WORKED WITH SOME

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:41.864
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WITH

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:42.431
INCREDIBLE TO INTEGRITY AND

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.633
DEDICATION. WHAT IS THE

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.034
EVOLUTION OF ITS

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.369
PROFESSIONALISM THAT I THINK IS

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.337
INSTRUCTIVE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.405
SOMETIMES YOU MAY HAVE THE

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.040
APPEARANCE OF PROFESSIONALISM.

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:52.308
IT'S ULTIMATELY THE STANDARDS

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.876
IN THE STRUCTURAL FORMS THAT

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:54.744
ACTUALLY BREED THAT

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.312
PROFESSIONALISM. THAT YOU CAN

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.481
SEE IN THE FIELD. AND IT OFTEN

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.516
WAS FROM THE MANY REFORMS UNDER

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.385
THE CONSENT DECREE IMPOSED BY

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.919
THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.454
THE CHANGE OF THE STRUCTURES

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.390
AND THE STRUCTURAL REFORM. TO

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.758
HAVE THOSE TYPES OF

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.259
PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS THAT I

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.627
THINK ARE IMPORTANT. BUT THERE

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.129
ARE OF COURSE LIMITATIONS AND

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.997
STRUCTURAL PRESSURES. THAT HAVE

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:17.166
THAT THAT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.301
ANY ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIA. TO

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.703
BREED THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.139
WE ALL WANT AND DESERVE. SO

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:23.539
WHAT DO I MEAN BY

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.608
PROFESSIONALISM. WELL IF YOU

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:26.008
LOOK AT THE OTHER

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:29.278
PROFESSIONALS- IN OUR SOCIETY

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:29.912
WHETHER THEY'RE DOCTORS LAWYERS

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.248
ENGINEERS OR ACCOUNTANTS. THERE

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.983
ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT THEM

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:37.219
THAT. WE PERHAPS EXPECT OUT OF

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:37.753
POLICE OFFICERS BUT DON'T

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.788
NECESSARILY EXISTENCE

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.223
CERTAINLY. GIVEN THE SIZE AND

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.592
THE DIVERSITY OF THE NUMBER OF

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.662
AGENCIES MAY NOT EXIST. BUT WE

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:47.563
EXPECT PROFESSIONALS LIKE IT

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.264
DOCTOR LAWYER TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.533

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.268
EXPECT THEM TO BE EDUCATED IN

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.036
THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE BEFORE

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.639
THEY EMBARK ON A TRAINING TO

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.707
BECOME A DOCTOR AN ENGINEER. WE

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.109
EXPECT THEM TO BE PROVEN WITH

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.577

EXPECT THEM TO BE LICENSED AND

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.450
CREDENTIALED. WE DIDN'T EXPECT

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.818
THEM TO ADHERE TO STANDARDS OF

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.619
CARE WE EXPECT THEM TO BE

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.621

WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.357
PARTICULAR FIELD. WE OF COURSE

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.725
EXPECT ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:19.195

BECAUSE BEING A PROFESSIONAL-

WHEN IT COMES TO POLICING. ON

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.802
THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.537
MANY OTHER STRUCTURES HOSPITALS

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.972
CLINICS LAW FIRMS ACCOUNTING

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.173
FIRMS. THAT SUPPORT THE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.908
PROFESSIONALISM OF THOSE.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.543
FIELDS AND THEN OF COURSE AT

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.911
THE STATEWIDE LEVEL SO MANY

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.613
REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT ENSURE

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.581
THE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.116
FACT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:15.618
NOW FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA I

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:16.819
HAVE TO SAY GIVEN MY

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.454
INTERACTION AND THE WORK I'VE

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:19.688
DONE WITH MANY DEPARTMENTS

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.223
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.859
IS FAR AHEAD ON THE CURVE ON

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:24.393
THE ISSUE OF POLICING AND

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.495
PROFESSIONALISM. WE DO HAVE

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.630
CALIFORNIA POST WITH ITS

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.632
STANDARDS WE HAVE MANY AGENCIES

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.432
THAT HAVE TAKEN IT ON

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:31.901
THEMSELVES TO PROMOTE THE IDEA

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.669
OF PROFESSIONAL POLICING. NOT

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:36.138
JUST THE L. A. P. D. BUT

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:36.739
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A VERY LOW

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.475
BAR. THERE ARE MANY DEPARTMENTS

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.543
OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THE

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.378
UNITED STATES WHERE ACADEMY

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.946
CERTIFICATION MAY ONLY BE

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.681
REQUIRED FOR THREE MONTHS SUCH

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:47.216
INSTANCE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.784
WHERE ONE MONTH OF IT IS FULLY

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:51.053
ONLINE AND YOU ONLY NEED TO BE

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.922
CERTIFIED- IN THE ACADEMY

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.490
WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF YOUR

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.559
ACTUAL SERVICE. CALIFORNIA HAS

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.361
HIGHER STANDARDS WORK ACADEMIES

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.429
ARE ONLY GOOD ARE FROM FOUR TO

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.298
SIX MONTHS. BUT EVEN THAT IS

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.300
VERY LIMITED WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.201
WHAT WE WANT POLICE OFFICERS TO

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:09.538
BE ABLE TO DO. AND MANY OF THE

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:10.172
OTHER PROFESSIONAL FACTORS THAT

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:10.773
I MENTIONED. ARE LEFT TO THE

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.308
FOR HUNDRED AND MORE MORE THAN

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.276
FIVE HUNDRED POLICE AGENCIES TO

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.277
ADOPT AND FIND THE RESOURCES

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:17.046
FOR. WHETHER IT'S THE MINIMUM

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.581
STANDARDS FOR QUALIFYING WITH A

01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:20.082
FIREARM OR WHATEVER THE

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:22.451
EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE TO

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:23.886
BECOME A POLICE OFFICER IN THAT

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.689
CITY. AND IN CALIFORNIA- LIKE

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:28.324
IN MANY STATES TO BECOME A

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.325
POLICE OFFICER THE STATE

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.861
STANDARD IS ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.430
DIPLOMA. OR GED E. D. ARE YOU

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.564
WHAT BEING A U. S. CITIZEN. AND

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:37.633
HAVING A BACKGROUND. THAT IS

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.767
NOT THE STANDARD THAT WE WOULD

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.502
WANT OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS TO

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:41.804
EXERCISE SO MUCH POWER

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.806
EXERCISED DISCRETION AND USE

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:46.375
GOOD JUDGMENT. THE WAY I THINK

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.177
TO LOOK AT THIS IS A FRAMEWORK

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.412
WHICH IS TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:50.946
OF PROFESSIONALISM ON THE

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.848
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL ON THE AGENCY

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.984
OR INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. AND

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.286
THEN ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:57.920
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:00.155
SUPPORT THIS. OFTENTIMES RIGHT

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.057
NOW ESPECIALLY WE'RE FOCUSING

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.959
ON WHAT OFFICER SHOULD NOT BE

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.160
THEY SHOULD NOT BE BIASED THEY

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.195
SHOULD NOT HAVE CRIMINAL

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.730
HISTORIES AND ALL THOSE THE AND

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.465
VARIOUS THINGS WHICH IS.

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.600
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.302
BELIEVE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.504
SHOULD AN OFFICER B. WHAT DOES

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.473
A HIGH QUALITY OFFICER LOOK

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:20.075
LIKE ACT LIKE AND PERFORM AS

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.611
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. BUT AS

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.579
A STRUCTURE WE DON'T ENCOURAGE

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.347
THAT. WE SHOULD EXPECT

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.650
EDUCATION IN THEIR FIELD BEFORE

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.385
THEY GO TO THE ACADEMY WHETHER

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.719
IT'S A COLLEGE EDUCATION OR

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.488
SOME EXPERIENCE ON THE COMPLEX

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:35.791
ISSUE. OF CRIME AND POLICING.

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.226
WE SHOULD AFFECT THE WE SHOULD

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.460
EXPECT ESSENTIAL SKILLS TO BE

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.295
TAUGHT IN POLICE ACADEMIES ARE

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.131
VERY GOOD AT THAT THEY'RE VERY

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:43.198
GOOD AT TEACHING THE TECHNICAL

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:45.367
SKILLS OF SHOOTING OF DRIVING.

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.970
OF CONDUCTING ARRESTS BUT ARE

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.305
THEY EMPHASIZING IN ARE WE

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:54.977
RECRUITING AND ENCOURAGING THE

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:55.611
CORE FUNCTION OF POLICING WHICH

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.346
IS. SOLVING WHETHER IT'S

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.914
COMMUNITY POLICING WHICH IS

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.349
COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.550
WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO SOLVE A

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.986
PROBLEM OF A CRIME PROBLEM OR

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.388
MANY OR ANY OF THE OTHER

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.790
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IMPOSED

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:10.192
ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO SOLVE.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.026
BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE TO BE

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.895
REMOVED. ISSUES WITH MENTAL

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.363
HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS AND ALL

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.164
THE THINGS THAT VERY

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.265
LEGITIMATELY ARE BEING

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.233
DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC POLICY

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.002
CIRCLES AND IN THE COUNTRY. AT

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.637
ITS CORE POLICING IS ABOUT

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.405
PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.274
THINKING AND ULTIMATELY

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.909
DECISIONS WHETHER IT'S

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.745
INVESTIGATING A CRIME IN TRYING

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.513
TO DISCERN WHO IS TELLING THE

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.382
OF THE TRUTH AND WHO IS LYING.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:34.983
OR ITS CONDUCTING A SEARCH AND

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:35.918
SEE OUR X. SEIZURE IN APPLYING

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.353
THE LAW OR TO MAKING AN ARREST

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.689
OR CITATION OR OF COURSE

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.624
WHETHER THEY SHOULD USE FORCE.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.961
BUT THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:46.562
THAN AN OFFICER IS EXPECTED TO

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:47.663
MAKE. WHEN PRESS THAT INPUT

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.666
TAKE AWAY A LIFE. WHAT DO WE AS

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.735
A STRUCTURAL MATTER EMPHASIZE

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.470
THOSE DECISION MAKING SKILLS

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.604
AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:58.440
EXPERIENCE ALSO HAVING BEEN

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.041
GONE THROUGH THE L. A. P. D.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:00.509
ACADEMY. THAT WE DO NOT DO AN

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:01.710
ADEQUATE JOB AND CERTAINLY

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:03.078
DON'T ENCOURAGE THAT ON A

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:05.814
STRUCTURAL LEVEL. AND THAT IS

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.282
PARTICULARLY TRUE ON THE LAW.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.284
DR HANNEKE MENTIONED ABOUT HOW

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:10.919
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS DEBATE

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.755
DIFFERENT ISSUES AND I CONSIDER

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:13.155
MYSELF AT LEAST A

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.257
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. THERE

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:16.225
ARE MANY THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:18.127
APPLIED. BUT TO EXPECT SOMEBODY

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:20.062
WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION IN

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.563
ONLY SIX MONTHS IN THE ACADEMY

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.998
OF WHICH A SMALL PORTION.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.633
INVOLVES ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.435
AND APPLYING LAW. IS AN

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.003
EXPECTATION THAT IS JUST NOT

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.239
REALISTIC BUT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.173
SHOULDN'T WE NECESSARILY NEED

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.374
TO LOOK AT. ON THE

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.409
INSTITUTIONAL AN AGENCY LEVEL I

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.078
THINK THE INSTITUTIONS MUST

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.446
FOCUS ON PROBLEM SOLVING AND

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.681
CRITICAL THINKING. NOT ONLY ON

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.984
THE SKILLS BUT ON THESE ISSUES

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.584
A PROBLEM SOLVING ESPECIALLY

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.052
WITH THE COMMUNITY. THEY MUST

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.420
HAVE VALUE IN EDUCATION AND

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.089
SCREENING A PROMOTION AND IT

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.791
MUST BE STRUCTURE AROUND THAT.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.260
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE NEED

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.028
FOR POLICE AGENCIES TO BEAT

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.731
LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS. LAPD

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.599
HAS STRUCK ME SO MUCH WHEN I

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.635
JOIN ABOUT HOW MUCH IT FOCUS ON

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.436
LEARNING. LEARNING ON INTERNAL

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.038
INCIDENTS AND ALSO LEARNING

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.107
FROM OUTSIDE AGENCIES IN

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:06.909
ACADEMICS. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.377
THAT IS SO CRITICAL BECAUSE YOU

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.711
CANNOT PREVENT THE NEXT USE OF

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.680
FORCE. IF YOU DON'T ANALYZE AND

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:14.750
ARE SELF CRITICAL ABOUT THE USE

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:15.217
OF FORCE THAT HAPPENED

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.318
YESTERDAY. THEY ALSO HAVE TO

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.186
ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY AND

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:20.856
INCLUSION BECAUSE DIVERSITY AND

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:21.456
INCLUSION IS NOT ONLY RIGHT TO

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.691
REFLECT THE COMMUNITY. WHAT IS

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:25.294
SO CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT IF YOU

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.129
WANT TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.431
AND THAT. IS CRITICAL IF WE

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.099
WANT TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.201
WHETHER IT'S ABOUT CRIME OR

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.335
MANY OF THE OTHER SOCIETAL

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.504
PROBLEMS WE HAVE. AND OF COURSE

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.639
WE NEED OVERSIGHT. THERE HAS TO

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:39.308
BE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:42.010
AND OVERSIGHT IN ORDER FOR AN

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:42.945
ORGANIZATION TO LEARN AND

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:45.180
IMPROVE. AND FINALLY I JUST

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:45.781
WANT TO SAY ON THE STATEWIDE

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:50.752
LEVEL. ONE SIZE CANNOT FIT ALL.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:51.787
NO ALL AGE OF THIS IN THE DO

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:54.990
CAN. THE LAPD CANNOT YOU CANNOT

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:56.892
HAVE WHAT MAY BE ADEQUATE FOR

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.460
THEIR APPROPRIATE FOR THE LAPD

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.429
TO APPLY TO THE NEWPORT BEACH

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:01.864
OR TO SHASTA COUNTY.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.832
CALIFORNIA'S LARGE DIVERSE IN

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.534
THEIR VERY MANY DIFFERENT NEEDS

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.935
OF COMMUNITIES AND AGENCIES.

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:08.303
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP THAT

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:09.905
THE STATE FROM LOOKING AT THE

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.241
SAME TYPES OF REGULATORY

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:13.141
STANDARDS AND THINGS THAT WE

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.943
EXPECT OF ALL PROFESSIONALS.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.346
MINIMUM STANDARDS TO BECOME A

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.881
POLICE OFFICER LICENSING

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.449
CREDENTIALING CERTIFICATION AND

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.451
YES DECERTIFICATION LIKE WE

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:24.386
WOULD ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL.

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.221
LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS I'M

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.422
LOOKING AT HOW TO IMPROVE

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.258
TACTICS AND OTHER THINGS.

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:31.126
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE SUPPORT

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.295
AND RESEARCH NECESSARY A FOCUS

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.796
ON HOW DO WE DEVELOP THE

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.099
OFFICERS WE WANT. THAT NOT ONLY

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.867
HAVE THE SKILLS BUT HAVE THE

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.502
CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.237

WE WANT AND EXPECT OF ALL

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.475
PROFESSIONALS. SO MY THOUGHT IS

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.743
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HISTORY I

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:50.479
THINK WHAT IT SHOWS IS A CALL

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.680
TO ACTION. FOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.015
AND OTHERS TO DO A

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.183
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION THE

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.051
STRUCTURAL EXAMINATION

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:58.020
POLICING. BECAUSE OFTEN THE

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.154
FRUSTRATION THAT WE SEE ABOUT

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.756
WHY HASN'T POLICING CHANGED

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:04.192
WITH ALL OF THE REFORMS AND

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:04.726
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THIS

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:05.327
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO AT

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.062
THIS BASIC FACT. THAT WE OFTEN

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.597
PUT POLICE OFFICERS AND HAVE

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:10.432
EXPECTATIONS OF THEM THAT THE

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.234
STRUCTURE IN OUR SYSTEM HERE IN

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.537
CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. JUST

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.439
DOES NOT SO PORT. WHO SHOULD BE

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.941
POLICE OR OFFICERS AND HOW DO

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.509
WE ENSURE PROFESSIONALISM ON AN

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:21.777
INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONAL

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:24.413
STATEWIDE LEVEL I TRULY BELIEVE

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.280
IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:30.786
COMMITTEE SHOULD EXAMINE.

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:31.420
CLOSELY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.421
I THE POLICE OFFICER POLICE

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:34.656
LEADERS AND THE WITH THE- AN

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.657
EXPANDED THEY EXPECT THESE

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:37.826
BASIC CONCEPTS. I THINK

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:39.394
REIMAGINE POLICING HIS

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:40.896
IMAGINING THE POLICE WE HAVE

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:42.464

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.866
PROFESSIONALISM AND THE URGENCY

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.101

POLICING IN THAT EFFORT SO- I

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:16.797

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.876
EXTRAPOLATIONS FROST. BETWEEN

TRANSPARENCY. IS TO BE OPEN.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:50.131
WITH YOUR COMMUNITY I THINK YOU

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:50.731
KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:54.068
ORIGINALLY WERE. PROBABLY THERE

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.403
WAS SOME PUSHBACK WITH LAW

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.671

ONLINE AND DOING THOSE THINGS I

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.209
THINK THERE THAT THE PERFECT

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.278

WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. THE KIND

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:17.358
OF THING WHERE WE ARE WE'RE

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.492
JUST SHOWING THEM OUR

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.294
PROCEDURES ARE POLICIES HOW WE

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:21.963
GET THINGS DONE. I THINK THE

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:23.097
FACT AND I THINK ALL THE

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.966
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY. EVENTS

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:26.867
THAT WE ACTUALLY HOST THAT THE

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:29.103
CITY. IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.038
TAKING PART IN THAT BECAUSE YOU

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.441
HAVE TO BECOME. PART OF THE

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:35.242
COMMUNITY YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:38.245
THE COMMUNITY. AND I THINK.

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:40.381
WHAT I'VE SEEN IS ONE OF ONE

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.383
POLICE FOR. THE DEPARTMENT THAT

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:44.251
CAN WORK WELL THAT THAT THE

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:46.387
THAT THEY HAVE A FORMAL-

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:48.856
COMMUNITY POLICING. PROGRAMS

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:51.225
BUT IT BE INFORMAL I THINK THAT

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:51.926
WORKS BEST IS WHEN YOU

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:53.728

YOU SAID AND GET OUT YOUR CAR

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.764

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.632

IN THE MEANTIME WITH YOUR

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:08.242

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.377
TOO IS. THE MEETING WHEN YOU'VE

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.245

OF LIABILITY ISSUES BUT I THINK

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:30.965
YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT TO THE

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.666

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:10.831
THE CONSEQUENCES OF. SOME OF

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.700
THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT IT MADE

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:16.203
IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. FOR

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:17.771
CHIEFS OF POLICE SAY

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:18.839
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THAT'S

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.642
WHAT THEY'RE DRAFTING IS- A HOW

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:23.577
TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IN

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:26.547
AND- BECAUSE YOU COULD EASILY.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.048
DECIDED THE CHANGE THAT HEY

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:28.582
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS

01:36:28.649 --> 01:36:30.317
PROCESS AND WE WANT TO YOU WANT

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.219
IT NOW THEY ARE TERMINATE

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.788
SOMEBODY. BUT THEN YOU HAVE ALL

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.423
THESE DIFFERENT BOARDS- THE

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.391
HELP THAT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.461
THROUGH AND MEDIATORS SOMETIMES

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.229
AND IF THE PEOPLE WIND UP

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:43.230
FIGHTING GETTING THEIR JOBS

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.666
BACK. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.334
TECHNICALITIES DOOR- JUST

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.703

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:51.605
JUST FELT LIKE THEY COULD GET

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.908
GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE. AND SO

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:56.877
THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT. FOR A

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:58.145
CHEAP TO DO THEIR JOB AND I

01:36:58.212 --> 01:36:59.747

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.482
PROCESS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:05.052
IN AND- IT CERTAINLY WOULD.

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:07.354
WOULD HELP- GO ALONG WAY THAN

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:10.357
TRYING TO- PROTECT THE

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.593
COMMUNITY. AND ALLOW US TO DO

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.663
THAT I THINK THAT THE-

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:16.130
EVERYTHING BECOME MORE

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:18.465
SOPHISTICATED. IN OUR WORLD AND

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:19.833
THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IN

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.903
TERMS OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND-

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.440

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.975
THAT GO BEHIND THAT HAVE BECOME

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:29.877
MORE COMPLEX AND SO. WE DEAL

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.111
WITH THE MUCH MORE COMPACT

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:33.047
SYSTEM THAN WE DID BEFORE SAY.

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.515

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.456

THERE'S A BODY YEARS SOMETIMES

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.576
BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:10.844
PERSON. IT'S VOTE ON A CASH

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.145
UNTIL THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON THEIR

OWN- MAKING DECISIONS AND

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.516
DRIVING ALONE IN A IN A POLICE

VEHICLE SO- COULD THERE BE MORE

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:20.587
TRAINING YEAH I CERTAINLY TINK

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:23.023
YOU KNOW IT- SO MANY TIMES THAT

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.291
I'VE BEEN EVEN IN MY PROFESSION

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:25.993
WHEN I AND EVEN AS A CHEAT. YOU

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:27.394
KNOW YOU YOU'RE CHEAP FOR A

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:28.261
COUPLE YEARS AND THEN YOU

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:30.063
REALIZE THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW AS

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:32.399
MUCH AS YOU SHOULD KNOW AND YOU

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:33.300
AND THEN THE SAME THING AS AN

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:35.302
OFFICER. YOU KNOW- I THINK IF

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:36.970
YOU LOOK AT THE MILITARY MODEL

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:37.938
I THINK IN AND YOU KNOW YOU

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:40.607
HAVE. YOU HAVE- ENLISTED FOLKS

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:44.578
THAT DON'T REQUIRE- A DEGREE

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:45.112
BUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:44:45.178 --> 01:44:46.213
COMMANDER THEM CERTAINLY DO AND

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:48.982
THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT- I DON'T

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:49.583
NECESSARILY EXPECT ALL OF OUR

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:52.219
GUYS- TO HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES

01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:53.020
COMING IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:56.690
REQUIREMENT BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:57.257
WE DO GET A NUMBER OF FOLKS

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:57.824
THAT. ARE COLLEGE EDUCATED

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:58.558
BECAUSE YOU'RE ENTERING THE

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.694
PROFESSION LATER IN LIFE. AND

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:01.828
DID DECIDE TO GO THROUGH A

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:04.064
CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAM I CAN

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:06.199
TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:07.801
YOU KNOW. THE APPLICATION LOG

01:45:07.868 --> 01:45:08.935
VERSES KNOWING THEORETICALLY

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.837
WHAT THE LAW SAYS. THERE'S A

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:11.805
HUGE DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.473
WHERE THAT THAT ON THE JOB

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:19.413
TRAINING

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.047
AND I DON'T THE- FOR SOMETHING

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:20.847
LIKE THAT I'VE BEEN SURE WHAT

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.015
WHERE THE YOU KNOW WE'RE- IT'S

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:23.850
NOT THE TIME YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:25.652
IN OUR STATE. IN OR ANYWHERE IN

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:26.687
OUR NATION. WITH WHAT'S GOING

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.321
ON WITH THE COVER NINETEEN AND

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:30.223
THEN TO SEE WHAT OUR- REVENUE

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:31.725
STREAMS HAVE BEEN DRYING UP IN

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.694
AND- TALK ABOUT THAT

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.396
NECESSARILY BUT- HI. I KNOW

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.798
THAT THE RE ORDERING OF OUR

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:40.300
TRAINING. IS IMPORTANT IN HAND

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.568
KIND OF PRIORITIZING AND I'VE

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:44.571
SEEN POSTS DO THAT- I SPOKE

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:45.472
ABOUT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

01:45:45.539 --> 01:45:47.741
AND- AND- AND I REALLY FEEL

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:49.342
STRONGLY ABOUT THAT I HAD READ

01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:50.110
AN ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:52.546
ON THAT. AND SAYING THAT IT'S A

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:53.547
REQUIRE IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:56.349
THAT'S- REALLY STRICTLY TESTED.

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:58.719
N. M. ELEMENTS OF IT ARE. IN

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:00.554
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:04.324
BUT IT'S REALLY SOMETHING BIG-

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:06.193
FOR RECRUITMENT BUT- MORE SO

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:08.128
FOR EVEN FOR PROMOTIONAL

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.597
OPPORTUNITIES- YEAH I DON'T

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:11.598
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY MAY

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.166
HAVE MORE TRAINING YET AND-

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:16.136
BETTING CARE- BUT I DON'T KNOW.

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:18.305
IF IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED MORE

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.140
HOURS FOR THEIR TRAINING- TO

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.742
LEARN THAT TOPIC BUT YOU KNOW

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:25.011
YEAH- CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THE

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:28.415
IT. I GUESS BE AT THE LEVEL OF.

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:35.622
A YOU KNOW AND I. THINK GERAKAN

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:37.157
WOULD TALKING YOU KNOW LIKE

01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:39.392
BEING IN A- IN THAT. HAVE GONE

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.194
TO LAW SCHOOL. THE AMOUNT OF

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:43.597
CRUDE LAW THE NOW. WITH COVER.

01:46:43.663 --> 01:46:45.832
IN THEIR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:46.967
IT'S PROBABLY THAT TO OUR THAN

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.835
MAYBE SOME OF GOING TO GETTING

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:50.237
TO A LOT. YOU KNOW AND SO THERE

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:53.073
IS A VERY. FORM OF LEARNING.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.242
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN CAST YOU

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:56.910
THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO BE HAD.

01:46:56.977 --> 01:46:58.712
AND THAT'S WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:46:58.779 --> 01:47:00.981
AS A IS SUCH A COMPLICATED-

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:03.049
PROFESSION. IT IS COMPLEX IS A

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:03.917
LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.485
BE ABLE TO DO. AND NOW WITH

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.754
MENTAL HEALTH WOULD ALMOST BET

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:08.955
THERE'S AND YOU JUST ON ADDING

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:10.457
THE THINGS THAT OFFICERS HAVE

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:11.825
TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE. OF

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:17.030
UNDERSTANDING AND. AND ALSO

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.698
COMPASSION FOR. MAKE A CHIEF

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:20.100
NEW IF I CAN JUSTIFY UP IS IT

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:20.734
OPINION THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:23.837
REFER WITH WITHIN THE EDUCATION

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:26.606
AND TRAINING. DOES THERE NEED

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:29.876
TO BE MORE QUALITY OF TRAINING.

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:33.246
I DO THINK THAT ANYTIME WE CAN

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:35.315
DO MORE- STIMULATION TYPE

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:36.483
TRAINING THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:39.252
DOING WITH THE S. B. T. THIRTY-

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.654
YEAH SO YOU'RE NOT ONLY DEALING

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.622
WITH THE ESCALATION. ISSUES BUT

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:44.391
YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH. THAT

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.393
KIND OF A MORE OF A REAL. TIME

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:48.161
REAL EFFECT AND THEN THE

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:50.263
SCENARIO BASED TYPE TRAINING- I

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:51.565
THINK THOSE ARE- THOSE ARE

01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:53.133
GREAT BECAUSE I MEAN. THAT'S

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.602
WHAT WE HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THE

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:56.169
APPLICATION OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.338
DOING- VERSUS WHAT THEY KNOW IN

01:47:58.405 --> 01:48:00.173
THEIR HEAD BECAUSE THAT THOSE

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.843
ARE THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE. A

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:03.944
CERTAIN AND THAT'S WHAT ABOUT

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:05.679
THAT MOST ACCOUNTS THAT THEY

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:06.213
HAVE TO USE THAT EMOTIONAL

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:08.448
INTELLIGENCE. FIFTY ESCALATE

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.617
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT IF THE IF

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:11.585
AND I THINK THE CURRENT

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:13.420
PRIORITIZE NATION. OF THAT

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:14.754

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.267
MODELS THAT WE CAN LOOK TO HEAR

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:42.535

BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.452
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO LAW

MANY DEPARTMENTS WILL. CREATE

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:06.459
INCENTIVES TO HAVE. OFFICERS

01:51:06.526 --> 01:51:07.994
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION BEFORE

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.396
THEY JOINED THE ACADEMY.

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:11.598
THEY'LL PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.733
STEPS IN IN SALARY. AND ALSO

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.502
SOME DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE-

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.237
EDUCATIONAL. REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:19.305
PROMOTION- AN ASSOCIATE'S

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:20.273
DEGREE OR AT LEAST SOME

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:22.175
CREDITS- SOMETIMES EVEN A

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:24.177
MASTER'S DEGREE- DEPENDING ON

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.345
THE AGENCY. I THINK THE

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.213
CHALLENGES THOUGH. THOSE

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.882
REQUIREMENTS ARE INCUMBENT UPON

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:30.784
THE INDIVIDUAL AGENCY TO DO IT.

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.552
IT'S NOT A STANDARD IT'S NOT

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:33.720
SOMETHING THAT'S UNIFORM

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.288
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND I

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:36.456
THINK THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.225
WE EXPECT. ALL OFFICERS TO ACT.

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:40.293
WITH THE SAME STANDARDS OF

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.128
CARE. THE SAME STANDARDS IN

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:43.696
USING FORCE AND THAT DECISION

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:45.865
MAKING CAPABILITY. I ALSO

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:47.267
BELIEVE AS I THINK I MENTIONED

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:48.268
AYE COMMENTS THERE'S A

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.502
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAINING.

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:52.005
AND EDUCATION. TRAINING IS

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:53.706
ABOUT SKILLS TEACHING OFFICER

01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:54.974
HOW TO DRAW OTHER WEAPON AND

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.643
FIRE IT ACCURATELY. TEACHING

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.178
OFFICERS HOW TO GET IT IN HIGH

01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.146
PRECISION DRIVING. THINGS THAT

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:01.748
I ACTUALLY LEARNED IN THE LAPD

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.083
RESERVE ACADEMY AND I WAS

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:05.185
ASTONISHED AT HOW WELL. I WAS

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.653
ABLE TO DO IN A SHORT PERIOD OF

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.421
TIME BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:09.055
THE INSTRUCTION. OF THOSE

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:11.224
SKILLS. BUT CRITICAL THINKING

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.393
AND DECISION MAKING. IS MUCH

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.328
MORE COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.596
DEALING WITH THE COMPLEX

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:17.997
CITIES. OF DEALING WITH.

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:19.632
COMPLEX SOCIAL BEHAVIOR.

01:52:19.699 --> 01:52:21.201
DEALING WITH CRIME. DEALING

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:22.168
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:23.870
THROUGH MENTAL HEALTH CRISES.

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.672
AND WE WOULDN'T EXPECT. A

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:27.674
LAWYER. WHO HAD NEVER GONE TO

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.142
LAW SCHOOL OR STUDY THOSE

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:30.877
THINGS TO ALL OF A SUDDEN GO.

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:32.779
AND BE AN ADVOCATE FOR

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:34.380
SOMEBODY. OFF ON MENTAL HEALTH

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:36.182
ISSUES BUT YET WE EXPECT POLICE

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.485
OFFICERS TO DO THAT. AND I JUST

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:39.252
THINK IT PUTS THEM IN SUCH A

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.820
DIFFICULT POSITION. TO HAVE TO

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.555
DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE ISSUES.

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:43.690
IN LITERALLY LIFE AND DEATH

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:45.992
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. WE DON'T

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:48.728
EVEN HAVE AS A STANDARD AND

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:50.763
ENGAGE THEM TO TEACH THAT

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:53.133
CRITICAL THINKING SKILL. AND

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.268
ONE OTHER ASPECT OF IT AS WELL.

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.569
MUCH OF THIS IS NOT THE FAULT

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:58.304
OF THE DEPARTMENTS POLICE

01:52:58.371 --> 01:52:59.005
DEPARTMENTS AND POLICE

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:01.241
ACADEMIES ARE TYPICALLY- THE

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.243
INSTRUCTORS ARE POLICE OFFICERS

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:04.744
OR FORMER POLICE OFFICERS WHICH

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.813
WE WANT IN MANY OF THE SKILLS

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.948
BASED ISSUES. BUT WHEN IT COMES

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:09.916
TO TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.718
CRITICALLY THINK- USING

01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:12.852
CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:14.587
EXERCISING GOOD JUDGMENT YOU

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:15.688
REALLY DO WANT TO HAVE

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:17.690
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS PEOPLE

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:19.058
COME FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES

01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:20.527
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:22.862
DIFFERENT TALENTS TO TEACH

01:53:22.929 --> 01:53:24.030
THOSE SKILLS AND OFTEN TIMES

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:25.798
THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE RESOURCES

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:26.733
OF A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:28.301
POLICE ACADEMY AND THEY OFTEN

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:29.435
HAVE TO USE OTHER POLICE

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.470
OFFICERS TO TEACH THOSE VERY

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:32.372
DIFFICULT SUBJECTS. AND I THINK

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:33.173
THAT'S SOMETHING ALSO

01:53:33.239 --> 01:53:35.909
STRUCTURALLY THAT THE STATE

01:53:35.975 --> 01:53:36.543
SHOULD LOOK AT TO ADDRESS THESE

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.678
ISSUES. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.013
THAT I JUST- JUST IF I MAY

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:41.548
MISTER TERRA COMMENT ON WHICH I

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:42.682
THINK ARE CALLING FROM PALM

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:44.017
SPRINGS ALSO MENTION ONE THAT

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:45.018
YOU BRING UP WHICH IS WHICH IS

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:46.519
THE QUESTION OF RESOURCES IT

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:47.387
WAS VERY AYE AYE OPENING FOR

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:50.256
ME- TWO YEARS AGO I HAD A BILL.

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:51.624
ON THE ISSUE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:52.525
TRAINING FOR GUN VIOLENCE

01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:54.060
RESTRAINING ORDERS AND JUST

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:54.827
GETTING INTO THE WEEDS WITH

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:56.329
POST AND SEEING HOW THAT THE

01:53:56.396 --> 01:53:58.264
COST ESTIMATES FOR TRAINING. ON

01:53:58.331 --> 01:53:59.132
HOW EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE TO

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.700
TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE IN

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:01.534
THIS ONE PERSON AROUND THE

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:03.002
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW

01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:04.204
WE ALTERNATELY HOW TO SCALE

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:05.205
THAT BILL BACK BECAUSE OF COST

01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:07.040
AND SO. I JUST WANT TO BE

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:07.707
MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE YOU

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:08.541
KNOW WE HAVE REALLY HIGH

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:09.876
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR OFFICERS

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:11.244
AND YET SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:12.378
ME THAT WORK. YOU KNOW I'M

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.446
GOING TO MAKE IT THE

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.547
INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:15.648
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TRAINING

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:16.883
THAT THEY THAT THEY NEED FOR

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:18.284
THE DIFFICULT ON TALENT IS THAT

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:19.686
THEY ENCOUNTER SO I THINK THAT.

01:54:19.752 --> 01:54:20.987
AS WE LOOK AT THIS TOPIC OF

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:23.456
POLICE REFORM I THINK WE NEED

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:24.524
TO IT TO BE WILLING TO PUT OUR

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.159
MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS- AND

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:26.893
BE WILLING TO INVEST IN IN

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.828
PROVIDING- OFFICERS WITH WITH

01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:31.030
THE TRAINING AND THE EDUCATION

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.131
THAT I THINK YOU'VE SUGGESTED

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:33.099
TO US COULD MAKE A REALLY BIG

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.300
DIFFERENCE HERE SO I THINK

01:54:34.367 --> 01:54:34.801
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:36.202
IMPORTANT FOR THIS. COMMITTEE

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:37.370
TO KEEP IN MIND OBVIOUSLY WE

01:54:37.437 --> 01:54:38.271
FACE EXTRAORDINARY BUDGET

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:40.240
CHALLENGES BUT BUT THIS IS

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:41.107
THESE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES LIFE

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:41.941
AND DEATH ISSUES THAT YOU

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:42.976
MENTIONED AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:43.643
AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:44.877
OUGHT TO. KEEP IN THE BACK OF

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:47.914
OUR MINDS AS WE HAVE THESE

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:48.514
CONVERSATIONS. SO THANK YOU.

TACTICAL. IN THE ACADEMY AND I

BECAUSE IF OFFICERS ARE DOING

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:50.643
SO MUCH. WITH THE YOU KNOW

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.612
PEOPLE AND JUST YOU KNOW HUMAN

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.813
ISSUES ON HE COMMUNITY AND

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.481
MENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.116
YOU KNOW MAYBE THE REQUIREMENT

01:55:57.183 --> 01:55:58.751
SHOULDN'T BE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:55:58.818 --> 01:55:59.452
DEGREE IF THERE IS A

01:55:59.519 --> 01:56:01.187
REQUIREMENT. MAYBE IT SHOULD

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:03.589
BE- PSYCHOLOGY OR HUMAN

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:05.191
DEVELOPMENT OR CHILD DEVELOP OR

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.693
SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. HAS

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:07.694
THAT EVER BEEN THOUGHT OF IF

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.228
THERE EVER IS AN EDUCATION

01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:11.164
REQUIREMENT TO HAVE NOT

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.532
NECESSARILY CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:14.334
BECAUSE YOU'LL LEARN THAT IN

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.034
THE ACADEMY MAYBE NOT AS MANY

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:18.971
HOURS AS- AS SHOULD BE AND YOU

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:19.639
LEARN THAT THROUGH THE SCOPE OF.

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:21.174
YOUR EMPLOYMENT BUT YOU KNOW

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.241
SHOULD WE LOOK AT OTHER ASPECTS

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:24.544
OF WHAT. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE DEAL

01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:27.146
WITH IN REAL LIFE IN THE

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:27.613
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.186
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S QUESTION.

01:56:33.252 --> 01:56:35.355
ONE THE QUESTIONS FOR MR OR IS

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:37.056
THAT A QUESTION EITHER ME OR

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:39.092
SOME MORE- OKAY SIR WHO TALKED

01:56:39.158 --> 01:56:41.060
ABOUT EDUCATION EITHER ONE CAN

01:56:41.127 --> 01:56:44.564
ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOW MY

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:45.131
NEXT THREE QUESTIONS WILL BE

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:47.934
FOR THE CHIEF. YEAH OKAY SO LET

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.302
ME LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:52.004
BEFORE THE CHIEF DOES I BELIEVE

01:56:52.071 --> 01:56:53.606
THAT HAVING A DIVERSE

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:55.508
EDUCATIONAL WORK FOR A

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:56.476
WORKFORCE WITH DIVERSE

01:56:56.542 --> 01:56:57.510
EDUCATION WOULD BE VERY

01:56:57.577 --> 01:56:59.746
HELPFUL- I DO THINK THERE

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:00.580
SHOULD BE SOME REQUIREMENTS

01:57:00.646 --> 01:57:02.115
THAT THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF

01:57:02.181 --> 01:57:03.850
UNDERSTANDING THE LAW IN THE

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:05.218
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:07.353
HAVING THAT DIVERSITY OF

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:09.389
PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER OTHER-

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:10.690
EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS WOULD

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:11.991
DEFINITELY BE USEFUL BECAUSE

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:14.060
POLICING AS AS AS AN INDIVIDUAL

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:15.661
AND AS AN INSTITUTION IS ABOUT

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:17.530
TRYING TO SOLVE. PROBLEMS IN

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:18.965
HAVING THAT DIVERSITY OF

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:19.632
BACKGROUNDS I THINK IT'S

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:23.603
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. JUST AS

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:24.203
DIVERSITY OF ETHNICITY CULTURE

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.272
BACK IT'S AND THERE IS- THERE

01:57:26.339 --> 01:57:27.940
IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHEN YOU

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:29.509
LOOK AT THE FBI WHICH OF COURSE

01:57:29.575 --> 01:57:30.777
IS VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:31.911
THEM BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:34.213
AGENCY THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:34.814
TO NINE ONE ONE CALLS OR THESE

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:36.315
CRISIS SITUATIONS BUT THEY

01:57:36.382 --> 01:57:37.917
CERTAINLY ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:39.218
ON THEIR INVESTIGATIVE COULD BE

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.620
CAPABILITIES IN DEALING WITH

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:42.455
COMPLEX ISSUES AND THEY VERY

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:44.257
MUCH EMPHASIZE NOT JUST HAVING

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:45.825
A COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT ALSO A

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:46.959
GRADUATE DEGREE OR OTHER

01:57:47.026 --> 01:57:48.694
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:49.996
THEY DELIBERATELY RECRUIT FROM

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.898
A BROAD ARRAY OF DISCIPLINES

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:54.100
FROM MEDICINE TO LAWYERS TO

01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.436
ACCOUNTANTS TO- PSYCHOLOGY AND

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:58.137
I THINK THAT WOULD BENEFIT

01:57:58.204 --> 01:57:59.305
POLICE DEPARTMENTS IF THERE

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:01.340
WERE TO EMPHASIZE THIS ISSUE OF

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:03.276
CRITICAL THINKING CRITICAL AND

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.577
DECISION MAKING AND EXERCISING

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:10.616
JUDGMENT- IN THE ROLE. THANK

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:12.685

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:19.292
NOT SURE TO THE CHIEF WANTED TO

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:23.996
ADD UPON THAT AS WELL. I THE

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:25.832
ONLY THING I. I DO THINK THAT

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.366
THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING ABOUT I

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.235
THINK THAT SOMETIMES AS WELL

01:58:29.302 --> 01:58:32.738
BACKGROUND. ON THE- I GET THE

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.941
MORE VERSATILE OR DIVERSIFIED

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.576
THAT SOMEONE CAN BE IN THEIR-

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:37.910
THEIR EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:40.413
SOMETIMES- BRINGS FORTH THE

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.183
ABILITY TO LIKE I SAID BEFORE.

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:45.418
TO WELL TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.986
THE SITUATION BUT TO ACTUALLY

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:49.655
BE ABLE TO THE FRAME PROBLEMS.

01:58:49.722 --> 01:58:51.224
IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT MAYBE

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.626
SOMEBODY THAT ONLY HAD- YOU

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:55.228

ALL OF THEM WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:49.048
BUT JUST WANT TO ASK OVERALL

01:59:49.115 --> 01:59:50.683
THE LAST I GUESS YEAR AND A

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:54.287
HALF- SINCE WE'VE- HAD THE BILL

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:56.789
INTO INTO A FACT AB THREE NINE

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.525
TWO- THAT YOU KNOW THAT DEADLY

01:59:59.592 --> 02:00:01.527

POSITION AT THE END THAT BECAME

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:11.070
LAW. AND I THINK THE LAW WAS

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.806
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.107

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:19.345
OF DEADLY FORCE AND LOOKING AT

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:20.846
THE NUMBERS IT LOOKS LIKE IN

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:21.514
THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE HAD

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.516
FEWER. OFFICER INVOLVED

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:26.085
SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA BUT

ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:31.924
POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:34.060
THE STATE EVEN YOURS. IN

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:36.495
TRAINING AND DE ESCALATION

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:42.268
EFFORTS AND WHAT WE ARE DOING.

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:42.868
TO PREVENT THESE IN THE FIRST

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:46.405
PLACE. YEAH WE- I THINK YOU'RE

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:47.974

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.642
OBVIOUSLY THE- THREE NINETY

02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:52.645
TWO- WAS A WAS A HEAVY LIFT FOR

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.246
EVERYBODY. AND GETTING THAT

02:00:54.313 --> 02:00:56.182
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE IF YOU

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:59.952
WILL BUT- YEAH BUT IT WAS- WELL

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:02.254
CRAFTED AND- DID PROVIDE THE

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:05.725
STRUCTURE. THAT THAT WE NEEDED

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:08.494
TO HAVE FOR OUR STATE. AND I

02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:11.364
THINK THAT- AND DEFINING YOU

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.898
KNOW USE OF FORCE IN DEFINING

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:16.802
THE DEADLY. USES OF FORCE AND

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:19.372
IT IT WAS. I WHAT ANYTIME YOU

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.173
CREATE LEGISLATION LIKE THAT

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:23.242
THAT KIND OF MAGNITUDE. IT

02:01:23.309 --> 02:01:24.977
CHANGES POLICY OBVIOUSLY AND IT

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:27.113
ALSO CHANGES ALL WHICH HELPS TO

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:28.781
CHANGE- PROBABLY CULTURE A

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.883
LITTLE BIT. AT LEAST IN THE

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:32.118
INSTRUCTIONAL PHASE OF YOU KNOW

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.719
WHAT THESE POLICIES IN THE

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:36.122
LEGISLATION. ARE IDENTIFYING

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:37.957
AND I THINK. I THINK IF YOU

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.558
LOOK AT- THE USE OF FORCE IN

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.360
GENERAL LIKE- AS YOU INDICATED

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.762
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT

02:01:42.828 --> 02:01:44.997
WE WERE IMPORTING TO THE- DOJ

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.098
THAT YOU KNOW CREATING SERIOUS

02:01:46.165 --> 02:01:48.234
INJURY OR DEATH- THAT THEY'VE

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:49.969
ALL BEEN REDUCED AND I THINK

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:51.837
THAT'S PART OF THAT IS. IS TO

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.105
THAT TRAINING I THINK IF WE

02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:54.206
KEEP THIRTY EVEN THOUGH IT

02:01:54.273 --> 02:01:55.908
DOESN'T FULLY COME INTO EFFECT

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:59.245
UNTIL- JANUARY- I THINK A LOT

02:01:59.311 --> 02:02:01.280
OF US HAVE ALREADY. DROPPED THE

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:02.848
STATE A HAVE A HAVE CHANGE OUR

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:05.751
POLICIES ON DE ESCALATION AND

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.286
THEN ALL THE VERBIAGE AND ALL

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.287
THE WORDING THAT SUPPOSED TO BE

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:10.389
IN THERE- BY THAT DATE R. AS IN

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:11.991
THERE I KNOW THAT'S- TRUE ABOUT

02:02:12.058 --> 02:02:14.493
MY POLICY. IN MY DEPARTMENT AND

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.028
WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN THAT POLICY

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:17.363
OUT WE'VE ALREADY HAD TRAINING

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:19.432
ON THAT SO. THAT OUR OFFICERS

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:21.133
ARE HIRING TRAINING ON THE

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.802
POLICY ITSELF WE'RE GETTING SET

02:02:22.868 --> 02:02:24.437
UP HERE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR

02:02:24.503 --> 02:02:25.404
TWO I BELIEVE IN NOVEMBER WE'RE

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:27.339
GOING TO BE. DOING THE FORMAL

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:28.574
TRAINING WERE WAITING PROPOSED

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:29.642
TO COME OUT WITH THE SIMULATORS

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:35.748
TO HELP US WITH THAT TRAINING-

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:36.949
BUT- WHAT ARE YOU KNOW I DO.

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.784
THAT I THINK. I THINK WHAT IT

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:40.186
DOES IS IT BRINGS EVERYTHING TO

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:43.556
THE POOR. AND MAY CAUSE PEOPLE

02:02:43.622 --> 02:02:44.824
TO. NOT ONLY CHANGE LIKE I SAID

02:02:44.890 --> 02:02:46.625
THEIR POLICIES BUT CHANGED- YOU

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.494
KNOW. THEIR CULTURE PERHAPS AND

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:49.729

BIASED ON THIS SITUATION ONLY

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:16.075
BECAUSE IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH

02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:17.276
THE EXCEPTION OF THE CITY OF

HUNTINGTON BEACH- ALL OF OUR

02:05:21.013 --> 02:05:22.081
OFFICER OF ALL SHOOTINGS ARE

INVESTIGATED BY THE DISTRICT

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.251
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THERE'S

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:27.686
SPECIALIZED UNIT- ABOUT CIVIL

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:30.723
SHOOTING UNIT THAT- THEY CALL

THAT THE ROLLOUT TEAM TO COME

02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:33.225
OUT. TO THAT AND IF YOU AND I

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:36.528
THINK ONE- THE- DOJ AT- CAL

02:05:36.595 --> 02:05:39.498
DOJA DONE- LOOK AT ALL OF THE

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:41.100
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN

CALIFORNIA WHOSE LARGEST TOP

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:44.236
TEN PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T YOU KNOW

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:46.405
LIVED AT THE GATE HEARINGS I

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:48.974
THINK LORD COUNTY VA WAS NUMBER

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:50.342
ONE ONLY BECAUSE THEY

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:52.111
INVESTIGATE ALL THE CITIES

02:05:52.177 --> 02:05:53.712
WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY. I NEED TO

02:05:53.779 --> 02:05:54.513
BE TO ACTUALLY USE THAT THE

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.781
SHERIFF'S BUT THE TERRORISTS

02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:56.949

02:05:57.016 --> 02:05:59.418
SITUATION THEY USE THE DA'S

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.853
OFFICE SO- I'M NOT SURE WHY

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.621
THEY DON'T USE THE DA'S OFFICE

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:05.958
BUT- I DO THINK THAT THERE IS-

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:09.128
BECAUSE THE IT. I DO THINK THAT

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.997
ONE IS IT CREATES A SEPARATION

02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:14.700
AND ALLOWS FOR- YOU KNOW THAT

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:15.935
LIKE YOU SAID EVEN IF YOUR

02:06:16.001 --> 02:06:17.469
NEIGHBORING AGENCY THERE'S

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:18.037
ALWAYS GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT

02:06:18.103 --> 02:06:19.738
SOMEBODY THINKING THAT YOU KNOW

02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:22.241
THAT IT NEW OR WHAT THAT IS-

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:24.877
IMPARTIAL AS THEY CAN BE BUT-

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:26.445
AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:27.446
EVEN WITH THE AID THEY

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:28.414
CONCERNED THE KIDS ARE

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.715
PROSECUTING THE THEY WANT TO

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:31.650
PROSECUTE COPS I THINK THEY

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:32.785
WANT TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE THAT

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:34.853
COMMIT YOU KNOW CRIMES. AND

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.355
ANAHIT COPIES COMMITTEE CRIME

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:37.489
THEY WILL FALL THROUGH THE

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:41.293
PROSECUTION BUT- SO AND I AM

THAT ARE NOW CREATING THESE

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:51.003
REVITALIZED UNITS WHERE THEY'RE

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:53.973

THAT THE THAT THE SECOND PART

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.054
WITH THE AG COMES IN BECAUSE

I'LL BE BRIEF ON THE ONLY

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:47.139
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE-

02:10:47.206 --> 02:10:48.607

CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IT'S THE

02:11:19.838 --> 02:11:21.139
DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON HOW

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:53.038
POLICE OFFICERS DID NOT OCCUR

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:59.778
NOR DO THEY GET PASSED. ON. TO

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:00.379

EUROPE BAT THANK YOU MR ST. SO

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:06.985
I WANTED TO REVISIT THAT THAT

02:12:07.052 --> 02:12:09.354
TOPIC THAT MR MAYES SR GABRIEL

02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:11.490
REYES AROUND EDUCATION. I HAD

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:13.125
THE PRIVILEGE IN MY CAPACITY AS

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:13.759
A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:15.627
COMMITTEE OF GOING TO NORWAY

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:17.329
AND SEEING. THE TRAINING THEY

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:19.164
DO FOR THEIR OFFICERS THAT ARE

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:21.199
IN PRISONS AND- IT WAS A

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:23.035
FASCINATING FASCINATING

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.136
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE DO

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.904
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:27.472
THOSE INDIVIDUALS COME INTO

02:12:27.539 --> 02:12:29.474
THIS ACADEMY THEY GET TWO YEARS

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:31.443
OF EDUCATION. AND THE

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:32.577
EQUIVALENT OF AN ASSOCIATES

02:12:32.644 --> 02:12:33.812
DEGREE BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE

02:12:33.879 --> 02:12:35.914
PRISONS AND DO THEIR JOB DURING

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:37.182
THAT TIME THEY ARE TAUGHT

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.650
PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.686
CRIMINOLOGY. AND THEY COME OUT

02:12:40.752 --> 02:12:42.054
WITH A DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT.%

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.522
PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT

02:12:43.588 --> 02:12:44.423
WE'RE PROVIDING HERE IN

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:46.391
CALIFORNIA. AND I APPRECIATE

02:12:46.458 --> 02:12:47.659
THE SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT INTO

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:49.328
PLACE A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT I

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:51.229
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:53.365
CRITICAL THINKING THAT WAS

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:55.300
MENTIONED BY BOTH DR HANNEKE

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:57.235
AND MISTER ALI KHAN. ABOUT THE

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:58.737
DISCRETION THAT IS GIVING IN

02:12:58.804 --> 02:13:00.072
AND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:01.740
MAKING THOSE CHOICES AND-

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:03.041
PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:04.943
THINKING IS SO IMPORTANT AT

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.878
SUCH A GOOD TOPIC BUT- WE ALSO

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.080
NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:09.481
DEBT. THAT ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS

02:13:09.548 --> 02:13:11.283
GRADUATE WITH THESE DAYS AND

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:14.553
THEN WHAT WE ARE ASKING FROM

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:15.120
THEM. IS A LOT. WHEN I WOULD

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:16.955
URGE US AS LEGISLATORS TO THINK

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:19.157
CREATIVELY I KNOW WE ALL. JUST

02:13:19.224 --> 02:13:20.125
DID FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:21.760
IN CUTS WE ARE IN THE GREATEST

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.495
RECESSION IN MY LIFETIME. BUT

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.263
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:26.832
COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THIS STATE IT

02:13:26.898 --> 02:13:28.300
IS TEACHING MANY OF THE THINGS

02:13:28.367 --> 02:13:29.468
THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE

02:13:29.534 --> 02:13:31.436
TODAY. AND SO ARE THERE WAYS IN

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:33.004
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM TO PROVIDE

02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:35.240
THIS EDUCATION. TO THOSE GOING

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:37.442
INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT NO COST

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:38.410
TO THEM WITH A DEGREE ON THE

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:39.945
OTHER SIDE OF IT. RATHER THAN

02:13:40.011 --> 02:13:41.313
PUTTING ON THEM ADDITIONAL

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.781
COLLEGE DEBT AND THE THINGS

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.416
THAT WE KNOW ARE SO BURDENSOME

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:45.317
AND SO I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T

02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:46.818
HAVE TO BE. WHERE THE

02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:48.220
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I THINK WE

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:49.020
CAN BE CREATIVE AND PROBLEM

02:13:49.087 --> 02:13:50.989
SOLVING. BUT WITH THAT I DO

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:52.624
HAVE A QUESTION AND I'M FOR MR

02:13:52.691 --> 02:13:53.859
ALL THE CON WHICH IS GIVEN MY

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:56.395
EXPERIENCE AND- AND- WHAT I GOT

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.729
TO SEE IN OUR WAY AND REALLY

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.431
THE VALUE OF THAT EDUCATION I'M

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:01.500
CURIOUS IF. YOU TALK A LITTLE

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:02.901
BIT IN RESPONSE TO MR GABRIEL'S

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:04.336
QUESTIONS ABOUT CALIFORNIA

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:06.004
CALIFORNIA'S DOING. BUT I THINK

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:07.839
WHEN WE LOOK BROADER THERE ARE

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:08.974
SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT WE

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.443
CAN- LOOK TO AND BE BETTER FROM

02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:13.378
AND I. SO I JUST ASK OUR THEIR

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:14.646
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:15.247
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:16.381
THE YOU WOULD ADVISE US TO

02:14:16.448 --> 02:14:23.155
MIRROR. AND TO BETTER EMULATE.

02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:25.824
REMEMBER I THINK JUST ACTUALLY

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:27.192
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:28.293
TOUCHED UPON ABOUT OTHER

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:29.761
SYSTEMS ARE ACCESS AND OF

02:14:29.828 --> 02:14:31.496
COURSE THIS THE TO EDUCATION

02:14:31.563 --> 02:14:33.131
AND THE SOCIAL EQUITY ISSUES IN

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:34.633
THE DEBT. IS AN IMPORTANT

02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:37.269
QUESTION IT ON IN THIS IN THIS

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:40.105
ARE. ON THIS ISSUE BUT I DO

02:14:40.172 --> 02:14:42.040
THINK THERE'S ONE IN THE UNITED

02:14:42.107 --> 02:14:43.575
STATES ONE MODEL THAT WE SHOULD

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:45.777
CONSIDER LOOKING AT AND I'M

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:47.145
VERY HESITANT TO DRAW ANY

02:14:47.212 --> 02:14:48.680
ANALOGIES TO THE MILITARY BUT I

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:50.682
DO THINK. FOR MY EXPERIENCE

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:52.851
HAVING BEEN. A PROFESSOR AT A

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:55.387
MILITARY COLLEGE. THE EMPHASIS

02:14:55.454 --> 02:14:56.721
THE U. S. MILITARY'S PUT ON

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.590
EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING NOT

02:14:58.657 --> 02:14:59.624
ONLY ITS FRONTLINE SOLDIERS BUT

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.526
ALSO WITH LEADERSHIP IS TRULY

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:03.428
IMPRESSIVE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:04.563
AT THE STRUCTURES THAT THEY

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:06.164
HAVE HAD SINCE WORLD WAR TWO

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:07.899
WITH THE GI BILL AND MANY OTHER

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:10.769
PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE OFF. TO

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:12.237
ENCOURAGE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:14.306
AND SAILORS TO GET THEIR

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:16.842
EDUCATION WELL- WHEN THEY START

02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:18.276
IN THE MILITARY AT A VERY YOUNG

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:19.444
AGE WHICH IS SIMILAR TO

02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:20.946
POLICING WHERE MOST POLICE

02:15:21.012 --> 02:15:22.447
OFFICERS DO START AT THE AGE OF

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:23.648
TWENTY ONE. THAT THERE ARE

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.050
MODELS THAT COULD BE PUT IN

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:27.652
PLACE WHERE OFFICERS COULD HAVE

02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:31.122
A GI BILL OF SOME SORT OR- EVEN

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:32.057
IF YOU LOOK AT HE PROFESSIONAL

02:15:32.123 --> 02:15:34.626
LEVEL SOME MILITARY DOCTORS AND

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.261
LAWYERS WHO BECOME JAGS. OFTEN

02:15:36.328 --> 02:15:38.063
TIME THE MILITARY WILL HELP PAY

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.297
FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEN

02:15:39.364 --> 02:15:40.365
THEY HAVE A COMMITMENT OF

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:42.400
SERVICE AFTER THAT SO EXCUSE ME

02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:43.602
OUT SO I DO THINK THERE ARE

02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:44.870
MODELS EVEN IN THE UNITED

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:46.404
STATES THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED.

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:47.772
THAT MAY BE ANALOGOUS TO

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:49.207
RELEASE CERTAIN ELEMENTS WOULD

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:50.942
HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT IT

02:15:51.009 --> 02:15:53.745
SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY IS

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:56.047
COGNISANT OF. THANK YOU I THINK

02:15:56.114 --> 02:15:57.315
THAT'S HELPFUL AND YOU KNOW

GOVERNMENTAL USE OF FORCE THERE

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:34.139

02:18:58.463 --> 02:18:58.963
CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR

02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:00.765
ASSISTANCE WILL RESULT IN THE

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:02.434

02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:04.362

IMMIGRATION. ALL THOSE ISSUES

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:22.446
ARE DIRECTLY LINKED AND

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:24.482
INTERTWINED WITH THIS KOMMER

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:25.249
CONVERSATION AROUND POLICE

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:29.086
REFORM- WHEN I TALKED TO OUR

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:29.553
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:32.590
SACRAMENTO. I WANT TO SPEAK OF

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:34.725
GLORIA WHO GLORIA TELLS ME

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:36.093
GABBY I THERE'S NO WAY I'M

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:37.995
GOING TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:30:38.062 --> 02:30:40.297
ONE BECAUSE I'M UNDOCUMENTED TO

02:30:40.364 --> 02:30:41.432
IN IN PART OF THE REASON WAS

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:43.567
BECAUSE LOCALLY. WE HAVE TO

02:30:43.634 --> 02:30:47.071
FIGHT TO END THE NICE CONTRACT.

02:30:47.138 --> 02:30:47.905
WITH OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S

02:30:47.972 --> 02:30:49.740
DEPARTMENT LAKE CHARLES

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.442
CONTINUES TO BE BROKEN IN OUR

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:53.744
COMMUNITIES AND SO. HAVING

02:30:53.811 --> 02:30:56.814
COMMUNITY CENTER SOLUTIONS THAT

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.115
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT JUST

02:30:58.182 --> 02:30:59.717
BROUGHT BROUGHT ONTO THIS

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:01.886
CONVERSATION AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:03.487
THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE USED

02:31:03.554 --> 02:31:05.523
AS FOCUS GROUPS BUT I THINKING

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.324
PARTNERS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT

02:31:07.391 --> 02:31:09.560
THEY NEED. WHO ACTUALLY KNOW

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:10.928
THE ROLE THEY WANT LAW

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.530
ENFORCEMENT TO PLAY IN THEIR

02:31:12.596 --> 02:31:15.566
COMMUNITIES. AND SO. WHEN I

02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:18.235
WHEN I REFLECT BACK ON WHAT OUR

02:31:18.302 --> 02:31:19.904
LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE I

02:31:19.970 --> 02:31:25.443
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. HAVE BEEN

02:31:25.509 --> 02:31:26.877
FIGHTING FOR SO MANY HERE'S ITS

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:27.945
ACCOUNTABILITY TRYING. IF WE

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:29.246
DON'T HAVE A WAY TO HOLD PEOPLE

02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:31.849
ACCOUNTABLE TO MOLD LIKE IF AN

02:31:31.916 --> 02:31:34.518
OFFICER. I DON'T KNOW LIKE I'M

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:35.653
I JUST I'M NOT BE HELD

02:31:35.719 --> 02:31:37.888
ACCOUNTABLE IT AND I AM SURE

02:31:37.955 --> 02:31:40.157
THAT I CAN ABILITY SUCH A

02:31:40.224 --> 02:31:42.660
BROAD. LANGUAGE BUT- LAKE ONE

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:43.561
WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:45.229
ACCOUNTABILITY IS THAT SOMEONE

02:31:45.296 --> 02:31:47.264
THAT HAS DIRECT TIES TO RACIST

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:48.833
ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD NOT BE

02:31:48.899 --> 02:31:51.335
POLICING OUR COMMUNITY. WE

02:31:51.402 --> 02:31:52.837
SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO THAT AND

02:31:52.903 --> 02:31:54.338
HOW ARE WE BEING TRANSPARENT

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:56.907
ABOUT THAT AND THAT A LOT OF

02:31:56.974 --> 02:31:58.742
THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE USING

02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:00.544
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:02.112
IS OVERSIGHT AND THAT THERE IS

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:04.315
A COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT WITH- YOU

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.649
KNOW A DIVERSE COMMUNITY

02:32:05.716 --> 02:32:08.419
OVERSIGHT SO THAT- WE ARE

02:32:08.486 --> 02:32:09.787
ACTUALLY FEELING LIKE THEY'RE

02:32:09.854 --> 02:32:11.388
NOT JUST. THAT COMMUNITIES NOT

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:13.123
JUST COMING A LONG **** JUST A

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:14.692
FOCUS GROUP BUT ACTUALLY AS A

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:18.662
THINKING PARTNER. THEN SO THE

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:20.264
LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT.

02:32:20.331 --> 02:32:22.766
I CELEBRATED WE CELEBRATE ALL

02:32:22.833 --> 02:32:23.934
OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE

02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:26.437
HAPPENED BECAUSE- REGARDLESS OF

02:32:26.504 --> 02:32:27.972
WHERE WE STAND IN THE SPECTRUM

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:29.807
WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES HAVE HAD

02:32:29.874 --> 02:32:31.141
OPPORTUNITIES WE KNOW THAT IF

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:32.676
THEY SOME LICENSE BUT NOT

02:32:32.743 --> 02:32:35.746
ENOUGH LIVES. IN SEOUL FOR US

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:37.982
ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW

02:32:38.048 --> 02:32:40.251
TRAININGS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT WE

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:42.920
ALSO COMMUNITY HAS SEEN HOW LAW

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:45.189
ENFORCEMENT HAS USE TRAINING TO

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:46.991
DE ESCALATE. FOR SOME

02:32:47.057 --> 02:32:48.592
COMMUNITIES BUT NOT DE ESCALATE

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:50.694
WITH OUR COMMUNITIES

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:51.595
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS THE

02:32:51.662 --> 02:32:53.931
STATE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:55.332
WAS MENTION TO DATE EARLIER

02:32:55.399 --> 02:32:57.234
INDIA IS SUPER IMPORTANT. AND

02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:58.502
EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT DATA WE

02:32:58.569 --> 02:33:00.804
KEEP ON SEEING THAT THESE

02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:02.373
POLICIES THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:06.510
PASS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED.-EQUALLY AMONG THE SPECTRUM IN

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:09.313
THE STATE AND SO I THINK. WHEN

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:11.482
WE LOOK AT THE MOMENT THAT WE

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:12.783
ARE INWHAT THIS MOMENT IS

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:15.786
REQUIRING OF. YOU ALL OF OUR

FOR US TO. REALLY THINK OUTSIDE

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:27.898
THE BOX ABOUT WHAT THESE

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:30.334
REFORMS CAN LOOK LIKE. AND SO I

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:34.138

ABOUT. WHAT WE ARE HOLDING

02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:45.349

BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITY AND LAW

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:23.020
ENFORCEMENT. THAT WOULD BE THE

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:26.690
FIRST QUESTION. IN YOUR OPINION.

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:28.258
EIGHT SO I THINK IN MY OPINION

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:31.128
IN MY OPINION- THERE'S A LOT OF

02:34:31.195 --> 02:34:32.162
THINGS ARE NEEDED BUT ONE OF

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:35.432
THEM HAS TO BE- HAVING

02:34:35.499 --> 02:34:39.003
COMMUNITY REALLY SHARE HOW THE

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:40.471
ROLE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE AND

02:34:40.537 --> 02:34:41.972
HOW THEY WANT TO INTERACT IN

02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:43.774
THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:48.112
DEPARTMENTS- THAT HAS TO BE. AT

02:34:48.178 --> 02:34:50.581
THE CENTER OF IT BECAUSE WE

02:34:50.648 --> 02:34:52.349
CANNOT. WHEN UNITY IS NOT ABLE

02:34:52.416 --> 02:34:53.684
TO TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:55.486
SUPPOSED TO SERVE THEM. IT'S

02:34:55.552 --> 02:34:57.888
KIND OF YOU KNOW COUNTER TO IT

02:34:57.955 --> 02:35:00.457
IF TO CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW-

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:01.892
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:04.061
SOLUTIONS ARE WHEN YOU KNOW THE

02:35:04.128 --> 02:35:06.163
COMMUNITY HAS TO DO THAT IN.

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:07.064
AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER MOUNT

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:10.768
MODELS BEFORE. BEFORE THE

02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:12.636
MURDER OF MR STEPHON CLARK TOOK

02:35:12.703 --> 02:35:14.438
PLACE IN SACRAMENTO. AT THE

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:15.539
CRIMINAL ACT WE HAD BEEN

02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:17.975
CONVENING FOR A YEAR LOCAL LAW

02:35:18.042 --> 02:35:20.310
ENFORCEMENT. PARTNERS IN THE

02:35:20.377 --> 02:35:22.212
ECOSYSTEM SAID WE SET ALL OVER

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:24.415
THE SPECTRUM AROUND- ON YOU

02:35:24.481 --> 02:35:25.482
KNOW THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:28.452
LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY WERE

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:29.520
JUST MEETING BREAKING BREAD.

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:34.258
AND THEN. MISTER STEPHON CLARK

02:35:34.324 --> 02:35:34.792
WAS TAKING AWAY FROM OUR

02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:36.560
COMMUNITIES IN SUCH A VIOLENT

02:35:36.627 --> 02:35:38.595
WAY THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS NO

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:39.830
LONGER WANTED TO BE SITTING IN

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:41.131
THE TABLE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:42.299
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:43.467
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WERE

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:45.602
HAVING A YEAR BEFORE FOR A

02:35:45.669 --> 02:35:47.738
WHOLE YEAR TOGETHER WE'RE GOING

02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:50.174
ANYWHERE AND SO IT HAS TO BE

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:52.209
NOT JUST A LISTENING BUT THE

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:54.545
ACTION PIECE- I THINK THOSE TWO

02:35:54.611 --> 02:35:55.579
THINGS HAVE TO BE THERE

02:35:55.646 --> 02:35:57.147
COMMUNITY HAS TO HAVE A LEVEL

02:35:57.214 --> 02:35:59.083
OF POWER WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE.

02:35:59.149 --> 02:36:01.452
THESE POLICIES HAVE TEETH THAT

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:02.019
ARE HELPING MOVE THE AGENDA

02:36:02.086 --> 02:36:04.021
FORWARD. AND ONE QUESTION MR

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:05.656
HARE'S IN YOUR LEGAL OPINION

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.725
WHAT CHANGED WHAT CHANGE IN LAW

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:09.993
CHANGES A LAW. DO YOU THINK-

02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:12.062
COULD IMPROVE THE JUSTICE

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:15.866
SYSTEM TODAY. SO TWO THINGS-

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:16.467
THE FIRST CHANGE I THINK WHAT

02:36:16.533 --> 02:36:19.470
WE NEED AND WE NEEDED A LAST

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:21.205
SESSION WAS WAS THAT THE BRADY

02:36:21.271 --> 02:36:23.974
LIST- SO THAT OUR DISTRICT

02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:26.443
ATTORNEYS. NO WHETHER OR NOT TO

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.512
PUT COPS WHO HAVE HAD ISSUES

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:31.982
WITH HONESTY AND INTRUDE. ON

02:36:32.049 --> 02:36:35.185
THE STAND. TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE

02:36:35.252 --> 02:36:37.020
ARREST THAT THEY HAVE MADE WITH

02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:40.224
REGARD TO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN-

02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:41.125
CONFINED BECAUSE OF CRIMINAL

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:43.026
ACTIVITY. AND THEN YOU KNOW

02:36:43.093 --> 02:36:44.361
WHAT THIS LEADS TO YOU KNOW

02:36:44.428 --> 02:36:45.863
WHEN THIS COP IS FINALLY

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:48.599
FIGURED OUT WHEN PEOPLE REALIZE

02:36:48.665 --> 02:36:50.267
THAT THIS PERSON HAS A RECORD

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:51.602
OF MALFEASANCE AND LAW

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:53.604
ENFORCEMENT CONDUCT. ALL OF

02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:57.107
THAT. WORK FOR JUSTICE IS UNDER

02:36:57.174 --> 02:36:58.175
THOSE OFFENDERS ARE RELEASED

02:36:58.242 --> 02:36:59.877
FROM PRISON BECAUSE THEIR THEIR

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:01.678
CASES ARE BROUGHT INTO DOUBT

02:37:01.745 --> 02:37:03.280
AND IT PUTS A FINANCIAL STRAIN

02:37:03.347 --> 02:37:05.149
ON A SYSTEM EIGHTY ROADS TRUST

02:37:05.215 --> 02:37:06.817
IN THE LAW AND CONFIDENCE IN

02:37:06.884 --> 02:37:08.819
OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IS A

02:37:08.886 --> 02:37:11.455
CANCER AND THIS BRADY LIST WILL

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:14.324
HELP FIX THAT PROBLEM NOT ONLY

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:15.192
THAT THE SECOND THING I WANTED

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:17.294
TO MENTION WAS THERE NEED TO BE

BE AN ORGANIZER AS WELL. AND I

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:37.294
WAS. I WAS REMEMBERING ONE

02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.829
REALLY GOOD- EVENT WE HAD

02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:40.730
BASICALLY WITH OUR POLICE

02:45:40.797 --> 02:45:43.933
CHIEF- WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.568
GOOD POLICE CHIEF IN SAN DIEGO

02:45:45.635 --> 02:45:47.237
WHO IS RESPONSIVE WHEN WE WOULD

02:45:47.304 --> 02:45:49.205
CALL THEM BUT WE HAD OUR- ADOPT

02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:51.174
MANY UNION MEMBERS COME IN AND

02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:53.410
HIM COME. IN TO DISCUSS JUST

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:55.211
THE ISSUE OF CARS BEING

02:45:55.278 --> 02:45:56.479
IMPOUNDED THIS WAS BEFORE WE

02:45:56.546 --> 02:45:58.248
HAD THE RIGHT HAVE LICENSES.

02:45:58.315 --> 02:46:00.150
AND BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW THERE

02:46:00.216 --> 02:46:02.218
WAS. THERE WAS COMPANY POLICY

02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.520
IF YOU WILL AND THEN THERE WAS

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.088
WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:07.757
AND IT WAS A AN AMAZINGLY

02:46:07.824 --> 02:46:11.528
POWERFUL INTERACTION AND- ON

02:46:11.594 --> 02:46:13.296
THAT ONE POLICY ISSUE AND WE

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:15.031
GOT SOME RESULTS OUT OF IT

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:16.333
BECAUSE HE REALLY HEARD FROM

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:17.734
THE COMMUNITY AND THEY THEY

02:46:17.801 --> 02:46:20.303
MADE SUGGESTIONS AND- THERE

02:46:20.370 --> 02:46:21.438
THERE BECAME THIS LIKE. EMAIL

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:22.872
BACK AND FORTH IF THE OFFICER

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.774
ACTUALLY IMPOUNDED A CAR IN SO

02:46:24.841 --> 02:46:26.242
THAT OFFICERS FOUND OUT REALLY

02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:27.410
QUICK IF THEY IMPOUNDED THE CAR

02:46:27.477 --> 02:46:28.678
OUTSIDE OF POLICY THAT THEY

02:46:28.745 --> 02:46:30.080
WERE ACTUALLY TO BE TOLD ABOUT.

02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:32.248
THE COMMUNITY. AND IT BECAME

02:46:32.315 --> 02:46:34.117
AND LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.819
I WAS THINKING- YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:38.655
TALKING ABOUT UTILIZING THE

02:46:38.722 --> 02:46:39.155
COMMUNITY AS PART OF THE

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:41.124
SOLUTION. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING

02:46:41.191 --> 02:46:43.893
THAT. IT'S SO HARD TO PUT THAT

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:45.028
LOCK RIGHT AND I'M I'M

02:46:45.095 --> 02:46:46.463
WONDERING IF THERE IS IF WE

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.630
HAVE EXAMPLES MAYBE FROM OTHER

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:49.366
STATES. OR IF THERE'S ANYTHING

02:46:49.432 --> 02:46:53.703
THAT SCALABLE WHEN IT COMES TO-

02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:54.704
SOME OF THESE ISSUES NOT NOT AT.

02:46:54.771 --> 02:46:56.806
NESSA ARE ARE TRANSPARENCY

02:46:56.873 --> 02:46:58.341
WHICH WE NEED A LAW BUT-

02:46:58.408 --> 02:46:59.976
COMMUNITY POLICING MAYBE SOME

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:01.411
OF THE REFORMS THAT WOULD HELP

02:47:01.478 --> 02:47:02.946
BUILD TRUST IS THERE ANYTHING

02:47:03.012 --> 02:47:03.947
OUT THERE THAT THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:47:04.013 --> 02:47:05.482
THOUGHT OF OR OR THAT YOU HAVE

02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:06.883
SEEN. I'M THAT WOULD BE

02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:09.352
SCALABLE OR EVEN LEGISLATIVE

02:47:09.419 --> 02:47:11.821
LEE. IT'LL ALLOWING US AYE I

02:47:11.888 --> 02:47:12.522
GUESS THROUGH THE BUDGET WE

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:16.459
COULD DO SOME BUT LIKE. WHAT

02:47:16.526 --> 02:47:17.026
THINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:47:17.093 --> 02:47:18.528
LEGISLATING. THE FIRM I HAVE

02:47:18.595 --> 02:47:20.563
ONE IDEA AND IT COMES FROM.

02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:22.132
SOMETHING RECENT I WAS I WAS

02:47:22.198 --> 02:47:24.200
LISTENING TO NPR. AND THERE IS

02:47:24.267 --> 02:47:25.969
A STORY ABOUT A LONG FORCING

02:47:26.035 --> 02:47:27.203
OFFICER I THINK IT WAS DOWN IN

02:47:27.270 --> 02:47:30.707
LA. SHE WAS- AND I COULDN'T SEE

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:31.274
WHAT SHE WAS DOING ITS COULD

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:32.842
HEAR. SHE WAS DRESSED IN PLAIN

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:34.978
CLOTHES I KNOW THAT- AND

02:47:35.044 --> 02:47:35.712
EVERYONE KNEW SHE WAS A LAW

02:47:35.779 --> 02:47:37.213
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BUT SHE AND

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:38.415
SHE WAS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY I

02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:39.282
THINK SHE WAS SITTING AT A

02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:40.984
TABLE IN FRONT OF A RESTAURANT.

02:47:41.050 --> 02:47:42.685
CHATTING UP SOME FOLKS FROM THE

02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:44.120
COMMUNITY SHE WAS ON THE JOB.

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:46.055
BUT SHE WAS. IN REALITY

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:47.190
SOCIALIZING AND HAVING A GOOD

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:49.926
TIME. AND I MEAN TO ME I WAS

02:47:49.993 --> 02:47:51.628
THINKING LIKE WOW THAT IS

02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:52.862

02:47:52.929 --> 02:47:54.697
THAT'S- PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY

02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:55.999
WHAT POLICING SHOULD BE

02:47:56.065 --> 02:47:58.301
BECAUSE- POLICING. HAVE TO

02:47:58.368 --> 02:48:00.503
INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY. IN ORDER

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:01.771
FOR CRIMES TO BE SOLVED

02:48:01.838 --> 02:48:02.939
EFFICIENTLY THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:48:03.006 --> 02:48:04.240
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND IN

02:48:04.307 --> 02:48:06.476
ORDER. FOR ALL OF THIS TO OCCUR

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:08.111
THERE NEEDS TO BE TRUST. THEY

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:09.612
NEED TO BE TRUST THAT THIS LAW

02:48:09.679 --> 02:48:11.448
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER REALLY

THIS IS HOW THAT TRUST IS

02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:20.023
BUILT. NOW I'VE SEEN- YOU KNOW

02:48:20.089 --> 02:48:22.392

AND GUN AND ALL THAT. AND IT

02:48:27.363 --> 02:48:29.265
SEEMS KIND OF SCRIPTED YEAH

02:48:29.332 --> 02:48:32.135
THAT'S NICE. BUT WE CAN DO MORE

02:48:32.202 --> 02:48:33.670
NOW AS FAR AS A LEGISLATIVE

02:48:33.736 --> 02:48:35.705
SOLUTION. IT'S INTERESTING HOW

02:48:35.772 --> 02:48:39.742
TO CRAFT. A LEGISLATIVE

02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:40.310
SOLUTION FOR THAT BECAUSE-

02:48:40.376 --> 02:48:40.977
REALLY DEPEND ON IN THE- APART.

02:48:41.044 --> 02:48:42.545
POLICY BUT IF THERE WERE LIKE

02:48:42.612 --> 02:48:43.746
GRANTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT

ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:47.050
BEHAVIOR. THEN AGENCIES WILL BE

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:51.287
ALL OVER IT. AND REALLY. DO YOU

02:48:51.354 --> 02:48:51.888

THING TO DO AND THEN GET AWAY

02:52:35.278 --> 02:52:39.082
WITH IT WHEN WHAT THE BEHAVIOR

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:41.651

WHICH WHAT I WOULD PRIORITIZE

02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:25.354
BUT I KNOW THAT- IT

02:54:25.421 --> 02:54:26.689
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:54:26.756 --> 02:54:29.392
ACROSS THE STATE WITH LEADERS-

02:54:29.458 --> 02:54:31.394
RECOGNIZING THAT ON PEOPLE OF

NECESSARILY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN

02:54:47.176 --> 02:54:48.744
TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE

02:54:48.811 --> 02:54:52.615

PERSONAL BIAS AND INTERNAL

02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:56.652
RACISM IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY

02:54:56.719 --> 02:54:57.720
DRIVING SOME OF THESE DECISION

02:54:57.787 --> 02:55:00.423
MAKING- IN PART OF THAT IS WHEN

02:55:00.489 --> 02:55:03.192
WE SEE THAT- SOMEONE THAT DOES

02:55:03.259 --> 02:55:04.894
THE MASS SHOOTING CAN BE

02:55:04.961 --> 02:55:07.797
ARRESTED PEACEFULLY RIGHT. AND

02:55:07.864 --> 02:55:09.198

TIES TO RACIST ORGANIZATIONS

02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:23.045
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT

GETS TO THE- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:27.216

02:58:56.992 --> 02:58:58.194
THINK IN REALITY THERE IS A

02:58:58.260 --> 02:58:59.028
MIDDLE GROUND BECAUSE WE ASK

02:58:59.095 --> 02:59:01.297

ATTORNEY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE

02:59:02.231 --> 02:59:04.100
DIETS TO REALIZE THAT. THE DEEP

02:59:04.166 --> 02:59:05.734
POCKETS IS NOT THE POLICE

02:59:05.801 --> 02:59:07.436
OFFICER AND HIS HOUSE OR HIS

02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:09.772
PENSION IT'S THE JURISDICTION

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:11.874
THE CITY. AND IN MY VIEW IF

02:59:11.941 --> 02:59:14.343
CITIES WERE MORE ON THE HOOK

02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:16.579
FOR WRONGFUL DEATH EXCESSIVE

02:59:16.645 --> 02:59:18.814
FORCE USE OF FORCE. THEY WOULD

02:59:18.881 --> 02:59:20.483
HAVE THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:20.950
THEY'RE CHEAP THEY'RE

02:59:21.016 --> 02:59:22.551
LIEUTNANTS OR CAPTAINS MAKE

SURE THAT THEY'RE POLICING AND

02:59:24.053 --> 02:59:25.721
A MORE JUST WAY IN THE

02:59:25.788 --> 02:59:27.490

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:30.326

OF COURT RULINGS THROUGH THIS-

02:59:35.664 --> 02:59:38.267
DANA AXLES I THINK THERE IS A

02:59:38.334 --> 02:59:40.202
