OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.677
WISH TO SPEAK. MR MET THE SMITH.

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:33.878
I AM I THINK. THERE ARE ANY

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:34.479

00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:36.614
MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.249
SAGAS HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE MOST

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:39.551
RECENT SHOOTING THAT TOUCH MY

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:41.553
DISTRICT. NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH.

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.921
AND WHAT IT HAS BEEN CLEAR THE

00:28:42.987 --> 00:28:44.889
THAT THE FINAL INVESTIGATION IS

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.324
NOT BEEN. COMPLETED AS THAT THE

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.626
YOUNG MAN WHO WAS BOTH I

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.028
BELIEVE THAT THE PERPETRATOR

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:53.164
BUT ALSO A VICTIM. HAD GREATER

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:54.199
ACCESS TO A WEAPON THAT HE HAD

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:56.000
TO MENTAL HEALTH HELP AND

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:56.935
SUPPORT AND SO I THINK THIS

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:57.802
MEASURE GOES. ONE SMALL PART

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:58.536
THE WAY TO THE REST OF THE WORK

00:28:58.603 --> 00:28:59.604
THAT WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:02.107
DO BUT- I PLAN TO SUPPORT TODAY

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:02.607

I'M A STAR. HI SO I'M CURIOUS

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.917

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:17.288
COMPONENT FOR PUPILS ALONG WITH

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:20.425
PARENTS FOR EDUCATION. I THINK

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:21.259
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:24.162
DEVELOP ONE STANDARD-

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:25.497
EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENT FOR ALL

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.398
GRADE LEVELS AND BECAUSE THIS

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.701
IS MEANT TO GO TO ALL PARENTS

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.903
FROM KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.539
UP TO HIGH SCHOOL- I THINK THAT

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.241
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IN THIS

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.275
CONTEXT I THINK THAT THIS YES

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.243
YOU HAVE DEVELOPED SOMETHING

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:42.614
STUDENTS IS A VERY. GOOD ONE-

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.314
GETTING THAT STUDENTS COULD

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:43.781
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:44.849
NECESSARILY IN A CHILD'S

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.351
ANOTHER CHILD MAY SHOW UP WITH

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:49.287
THAT- WEAPON WHEN THEY FIND ONE

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.288
ON THE PLAYGROUND- BUT I THINK

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:51.389
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE HAVE TO

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:51.890
BE A LONGER CONVERSATION

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:54.826
BECAUSE GOING TO FOR FREE. FOR

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:55.426

COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE

00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:08.173
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I DO

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.974
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE-

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.509

DON'T REALIZE HOW INDUSTRIOUS

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.062
CHILDREN CAN BE WHEN THEY WANT

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:31.663

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.523
RIVERS AND- RIGHT NOW THAT THE

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.958
HERITAGE OF THEY'VE AMERICANS

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.694

VERY TIGHTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:52.336
HERE IN CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.238
OUR OUR HISTORY AND SPECIALLY

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.940
RELATE TO NATIVE AMERICANS AND

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:57.174
I THINK THIS WILL THIS WILL

00:42:57.241 --> 00:43:00.544
BLEND WELL WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:01.045

MEAN A LOT- JUST IN TERMS OF

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.959
CONTEXT UP. IT MAY PRODUCE

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.827
CONTROVERSY- WHICH IS ALWAYS

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.697
GOOD- BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:20.397
HAD KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.132
SOMETIMES HISTORY ITSELF.

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:23.634
BECOMES OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:24.501
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:25.903
THEY'RE DOING. AND I THINK THAT

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.971
WAS THE CASE WITH LAST YEAR

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:28.072

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:31.942
PULSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.077
THEY'RE DEALING WITH DON'T KNOW

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.812
WHAT TO EXPECT. AND THAT MAY

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:35.980
HAPPEN WITH THIS WITHOUT HAVING

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.881
