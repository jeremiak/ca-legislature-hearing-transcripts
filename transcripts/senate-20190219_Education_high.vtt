THEY REALLY WERE YOU WANT TO SET

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.719
WELL [inaudible]

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:30.489
FRIENDS HERE.

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:30.789
CAROLYN --

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:31.957
HALLORAN WITH THE CHARTER

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:32.925
SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND I

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:33.826
APOLOGIZE I GOT MY LETTER IN

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:34.793
LATE LAST NIGHT --

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.395
WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.063
TRANSPARENCY AYE WE ARE HOWEVER

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.765
OPPOSED TO A FEW PROVISIONS IN

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.734
THIS BILL THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.334
BEFORE WHEN THEY WERE IN OTHER

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.168
MEASURES.

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.070
AND THIS BILL IS NOT THE SAME AS

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.271
THE CURRENT PROVISIONS THAT

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.474
APPLY TO TRADITIONAL DISTRICTS.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.743
UNDER A COUPLE ITEMS AT ALL

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.177
POINT OUT --

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.479
FOR INSTANCE --

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:57.182
THE ISSUE AROUND WHETHER OR NOT.

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:57.816
I SAID ON A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.252
&lt;c.green&gt;OARD AND WE ARE ALLOWED TO MEET&lt;/c&gt;

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:01.353
WHEREVER IN OUR DISTRICT WE

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.955
WOULD LIKE TO MEET --

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.323
AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE THINK

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.791
THAT THAT INCREASES TRANSPARENCY

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:06.892
WE NEED AT OTHER SCHOOLS IN OUR

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.527
DISTRICT WE NEEDED OUR CITY HALL

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:08.794
WHERE --

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.029
IT'S AVAILABLE AND WE ALSO DON'T

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.699
HAVE TO DO IT TO A TRANSMISSION --

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.300
AND AND WE THINK THAT PUTTING

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.269
THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON CHARTER

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.804
SCHOOLS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.005
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:22.141
TRYING TO DO HERE --

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.308
BY NOT ALLOWING CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.544
TO MEET AT SOME OF THEIR OTHER

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.012
SITES.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.813
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WE

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.847
HAVE --

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:30.616
ANOTHER ISSUE --

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:33.652
IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAB

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.754
THE BURDENS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.923
ON CHARTER SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.324
THE COSTS OF THE TO A

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.125
TRANSMISSION THOSE SORTS OF

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.593
THINGS WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.628
BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.364
BENEFITS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.665
AND THAT WOULD IN PARTICULAR BE

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:46.899
THAT --

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.467
STATE MANDATED COST

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.935
REIMBURSEMENTS --

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:50.903
AND THE LA --

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.639
JUST PUT OUT A REPORT --

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:54.273
I THINK ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THE

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.407
MONTH.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:56.442
AND AND IT TALKS ABOUT ALL OF

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.609
THE COSTS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.211
ARE ENTITLED TO THAT CHARTER

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:00.679
SCHOOLS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.413
REIMBURSEMENT.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.681
FOR SO SO THOSE THINGS WE THINK

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.049
OUGHT TO BE IN THERE FOR GOING

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.317
TO START GOING DOWN THE PATH OF

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:06.919
REALLY MAKING CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.787
PUBLIC AGENCIES.

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.589
AND LASTLY I THINK THAT --

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:11.824
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.592
ANALYSIS.

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:15.160
THE IDEA THAT WE TALK ABOUT

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:18.163
CHARTER SCHOOLS ONLY HAVING --

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.966
BROWN ACT IN PLACE BECAUSE

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.167
THEY'RE AUTHORIZED YEARS IT WAS

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:23.702
PART OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF OFF

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.670
THE RISERS.

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.438
IS REALLY STRONG LANGUAGE I

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.774
WROTE A CHARTER IN TWO THOUSAND

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:30.542
AND FOUR AND I PUT THE BROWN ACT

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.877
IN THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.711
THAT WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:33.111
BUSINESS.

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.180
NO ONE FORCED ME TO DO THAT --

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.348
THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT FROM OFF

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:38.116
THE RISERS SO I THINK THAT WE'RE

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:40.819
JUST NOT LOOKING AT THE WAY

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:44.056
CHARTER SCHOOLS REALLY OPERATE --

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:47.426
AND AND MAYBE TAKING SHOULD WE

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.594
TALK ABOUT THE THREE CHURCH

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.362
SCHOOLS YOU NOTED THAT HAD TO

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.264
ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF CHARTER

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:52.898
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE AND THEY'RE

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:53.765
ALL.

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.034
DIFFERENT SO IT'S HARD TO APPLY

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.870
SOMETHING SO BROADLY AS TO THOSE

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:59.771
ARE CONCERNS THAT WE DO REMAIN

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.807
OPPOSED --

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:02.474
AND AGAIN NOT OPPOSED TO

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.209
TRANSPARENCY SO THAT'S A GOOD

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.477
FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE I I'M.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.546
THE THIS CASE IS THAT THE SOME

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.915
WOMEN LAID LAID OUT ARE PRETTY

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:10.782
PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED LA LA

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.484
TIMES MATERIAL HOW MANY CHARTER

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.085
SCHOOLS ARE THERE IN THE STATE

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:13.852
YOU KNOW.

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:14.953
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.488
CHARTER SCHOOLS REPRESENT ABOUT

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:20.592
10% OF SCHOOL CHILDREN STATE.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:21.860
THERE'S ABOUT. THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:22.394
CHARTERS IN THE STATE OF

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:23.028
CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY THERE'S ABOUT

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.930
A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:25.430
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:29.101
FAQ.

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.669
YEAH ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS IN

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:33.605
OPPOSITION.

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.841
CASEY NINE WE WILL PULL IT BACK --

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.576
TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:41.813
COMMENTS OR CONCERNS

THE AUTHORS THE GOVERNOR

STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING SO HARD

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.325
ON THIS ISSUE THAT HAS HAD A A

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.128
LITTLE BIT OF AN ESCALATED.

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:57.529
TIMELINE BUT SOMETIMES I WHEN

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.931
PEOPLE ARE IN AGREEMENT I

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.232
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'D LIKE --

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.134
TO LIKE TO SETTLE IT AND I KNOW

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.201
THAT MEMBERS OF THE THE

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:04.570
COMMITTEE AND AND OTHERS ARE

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.771
AWARE THAT.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:06.805
THIS IS AN AREA THAT I'VE HAD

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.807
LEGISLATION AND FOR FOR A FEW

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:11.009
YEARS CENTER ALLEN I BOTH.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.811
AUTHORED LEGISLATION ON OPEN

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.212
MEETINGS AND DISCLOSURE CONFLICT

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.148
OF INTEREST RULES AND I AM

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.683
PLEASED TO SEE THAT.

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.884
THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US --

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:22.588
MAYORS IN SOME CASES IDENTICALLY

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.855
IT'S PROVISIONS AND I AND I

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.424
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.924
I WOULD NOTE THAT --

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.926
ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:29.795
THERE IS AN EXCEPTION THAT'S

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.597
PROVIDED IN THIS LEGISLATION --

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:33.165
ONE IN WHICH I SUPPORT.

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.800
WHICH IS ACCEPTING TEACHERS --

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.501
FROM THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.437
RULES -- AS

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:38.971
LONG AS THEY DON'T HAVE A

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:39.738
FINANCIAL T!I.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.006
AT TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND I

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.407
THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:43.942
CHANGE OF CURRENT.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.744
LAW IF YOU WILL --

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.346
BUT I THINK ONE THAT --

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:48.213
MAKES SENSE TO ME AND I'VE SEEN

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.781
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:50.816
