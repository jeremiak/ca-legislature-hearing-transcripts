OF OUR ABILITY TO BOUNCE BACK- YOU KNOW FROM TO THE PANDEMIC IN YOU KNOW MORE SOULFUL MANNER IN A WAY THAT HELPS US HEAL. SO SO THIS BILL IS THE CREATIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACT IT WOULD DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN% CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL TO ESTABLISH AND EARN AND LEARN PROGRAM. IN CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A COMMUNITY NONPROFITS TO EMPLOYEE CREATED WORKERS.

OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL TODAY SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM THE SON OF CHIU SALVADORAN IMMIGRANTS I GREW UP IN LOW INCOME HOUSING AND SILVER LAKE. AND NEIGHBORHOOD IN EAST CENTRAL LA. GROWING UP A CREATIVE CAREER WITH NEVER DISCUSSED AS A POTENTIAL CAREER IN MY HOUSEHOLD. IN ARTS EDUCATION WAS NOT OFFERED IN MY SCHOOL I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS STILL THE REALITY FOR MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BURSTING WITH CREATIVITY. AND GROWING UP IN LOW INCOME UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES TODAY. AT A TIME OF DEVASTATING JOB LOSSES IN THE CREATIVE SECTOR DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE MUST EXPAND. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE CREATIVE SPECTRUM IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS THE ECONOMY AND CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA. CRISES CAN WORSEN PRE EXISTING STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES. AND WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE FROM OUR PARTNERS IN THE CLIMATE CRISES MOVEMENT. SB SIX TO EIGHT THE STEP FORWARD TOWARDS ENSURING THE JOBS RECOVERY FOR CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT ONE IN SEVEN JOBS IN THE ALLEY REGION OR IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS WERE LOST YEAR IN LA. BUT THE DEVASTATION WOULD NOT EQUAL THE EXPERIENCE AS AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW BLACK ARTS WORKERS EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF INCOME. AT DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS. FEDERAL LEAF HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR CREATIVE INDUSTRIES INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF FOR THE- SELF EMPLOYED. BUT WE KNOW THAT BY PARK ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS WERE DECLINED ACCESS THE FEDERAL RELIEF AT A HIGHER RATE. SB SIX TO EIGHT ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA PRIORITIZE THE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CREATIVE SECTOR JOBS. IT OFFERS TARGETED JOB TRAINING FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY CENTER FIELD AND PRIORITIZES THE LIVING WAGE TO BREAK THE CYCLE IN THAT INEQUALITY FOR MANY.

THANK YOU- I TO THINK SIX GREAT IDEA TO APPLY THE- TO THE CREATIVE ALL WORKERS OF CALIFORNIA- AND I SEE SOMEWHERE REFERENCE EITHER IN THE ANALYSIS- I DON'T KNOW IF IN THE BILL TO THE HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS- THAT EXIST WITH THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN WE CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IT HAVE THAT REFERENCE TO HARDWOOD PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH EMPLOYERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIP THAT. WORD THE CREATED WORKERS THEMSELVES LIKE YOU SAID TARGETING- FROM TARGETING COMMUNITIES OF FOR RECRUITMENT AND FOR TRAINING FOR APPRENTICES SO- HIRA PARTNERSHIPS HAVE ALL THOSE ELEMENTS AND- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED- WE'RE GOING TO PASS ON S. B. FOR ELEVEN WHICH IS MY BILL UNTIL THE END OF THE AGENDA TODAY WHAT THAT MEANS WE'RE MOVING ON TO SB FIVE FIFTY. SUNDERED ALWAYS BILL I THOUGHT I SAW HIM HERE AND HE IS HERE- SOONER YOU'RE WELCOME TO PRESENT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I HAVE WITH THE BILL UP TODAY SB FIVE FIFTY THE EMPLOYEE PROTECTION. THE BILL FOR THE LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES JEOPARDY SB FIVE FIFTY WILL PROVIDE EQUAL PROTECTIONS TO THE EMPLOYMENT- EAST OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED THE SAME PLAZA REQUIRED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR CURRENTLY THE PASSES THOUSANDS OF LAWS. THAT DICTATE EMPLOYEE WORKING CONDITIONS AND HUNDREDS OF REGULATIONS EACH YEAR ON BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONVENE EXEMPTED THEMSELVES. FROM SOME OF THESE BURDENSOME LAWS. IF THE LAW IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES IT SHOULD APPLY TO OUR STAFF AS WELL LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. OPPOSITION SIXTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES CHEMICALS AND HIGH FREQUENCIES OF LAWSUITS AGAINST BUSINESSES THERE'S FOR MALAHIDE IN THIS BUILDING. IN OUR OFFICES FURNITURE THAT CAN CAUSE CANCER OR BIRTH DEFECTS. FLAME RETARDANTS THAT CAUSE CANCER OR BIRTH DEFECTS LEAD FROM BRASS OBJECTS THAT CAN CAUSE CANCER BIRTH DEFECTS. WAGING OUR OR OUR EMPLOYEES DON'T GET PAID OVERTIME- ALTERNATE WORK SCHEDULES MEAL AND REST PERIODS WHICH ARE OFTEN ABUSED- FOR EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PAGA LAWSUITS. EVERY DAY THE LEGISLATURE CAN WE TALK ABOUT. EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHILE WE DON'T LIVE UP TO THOSE STANDARDS OURSELVES. I'M EMPLOYERS SO I KNOW THE VALUE OF THESE PROTECTIONS. AND I KNOW THE COST OF THEM IT TO COMPLY WITH THEM. EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT SHOULD BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAWS THEY'RE PASSING A TO CALIFORNIA'S BY APPLYING THEM IN THEIR- TO THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES. I CAN THIS CHANGE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AS AS WELL. IT WILL END THE DOUBLE STANDARD OF EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS. THAT OUR EMPLOYEES DO NOT ENJOY- I KNOW THAT- CENTER LAYERED THIS WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME I'VE PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND- AND- SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT I'M DOING THIS IS A STATEMENT BILL. AND I'M NOT THIS IS A SERIOUS- WE WORK SOMETIMES EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HOURS A DAY. IN THIS CAPITAL CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR AND- NORM PLEASE DON'T GET PAID OVERTIME. AND I IN MY OWN BUSINESS- I PAY THAT I PAY FOR THOSE. WHEN WE WORK LONG HOURS IN FARMING WHICH WE DO- WE PAY THE LAW ALLOWS NOW. HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE- THE YOU KNOW RULES COMMITTEE IS THERE REALLY THERE- EMPLOYER. BUT THERE AT WILL EMPLOYEES IN THE IN THIS CAPITAL AND LAST YEAR I STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND TALKED ABOUT- WE ARE PASSING SOME- EXIT OR SOME REGULATIONS ON THE BUSINESS AND TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE WITH THE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR VERSUS THE LEGISLATURE AND- THEN. SENATOR CHERUB BUDGET HOLLY MITCHELL SAID WILL THEIR SALARIED EMPLOYEES WELL I WILL BEG TO DIFFER THE SALARIED EMPLOYEES ARE STILL UNDER THE- OUR REQUIREMENTS IF NOT. EVERY CALIFORNIA BUSINESS WOULD MAKE THEM SALARY THAT DOESN'T APPLY IF YOU MAKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. AS A SALARIED EMPLOYEE. YOU STILL ARE REQUIRED AS AN EMPLOYER TO NOT ALLOW THEM TO WORK MORE THAN FORTY HOURS A WEEK AND IF SO YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE THEM. SO I JUST WANT TO BRING OUT THE POINT THAT THIS ISN'T SOME STATEMENT BILL I ASKED MY HIPPA THE STAFF IF I'D HEARD FROM THE CONSULTANT ABOUT WE KNEW SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BILL AND- THEIR THEIR INTERPRETATION WAS THAT THERE. DIDN'T SEEM TO YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND WHY WAS DOING THE BILL SO I AM VERY COMMITTED TO THIS BILL I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AS A LEGISLATURE AND- AS LEGISLATORS WE SHOULD. PRACTICE THE LAWS THAT WE PASS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL I DO NOT HAVE ANY WITNESSES BECAUSE I ASKED FOR SOME STAFF TO COME AND TESTIFY. IT QUITE FRANKLY THEY ARE AFRAID TO TESTIFY BECAUSE- THEY DON'T WANNA LOSE OUR JOB. THAT'S HOW SERIOUS THIS IS SO MEMBERS- I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE PLEASE. THANK SENATOR DOLE- WE'RE GOING TO- MOVED TO THE COMMITTEE GIVEN THERE ARE NO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES AGAIN WE'RE GONNA TAKE OF THE SUPPORT SIDE. OF THE BILL RIGHT NOW DOES ANYONE HEARING COMMITTEE WISH TO SPEAK ON THE BILL. A NOT IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM I WILL TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM APPEARS TO BE NO ONE PRESENT THERE TO SPEAK. SB FIVE FIFTY- WE WILL ESTO CONFERENCE OPERATOR WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANYONE IN THE QUEUE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FIFTEEN OF SO PLEASE LET US KNOW. THIS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE OF. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME YOU MAY PROCEED. OKAY THANK YOU BYE MODERATOR WILL GO TO THE OPPOSITION THE SIDE OF THE BILL WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AGAIN TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS ANYONE HERE. WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SEEN NONE I WILL NOTE THAT THERE'S NO ONE IN THE OVAL ROOM OF WISHING TO SPEAK BACK TO THE MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY OPPOSITION. OF WITNESSES- WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SB FIVE FIFTY. THANK YOU TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE FIFTY PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME I'D- THANK YOU THANK YOU MODERATOR ON THE PRINCIPLE. TO THE COMMITTEE ITSELF AND A LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUES ON A VERY HEAVY FOR ME MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT ON SENATOR DOLE YET THEIR PRE SHEET. A YOUR EFFORTS- WITH REGARD TO DRAWING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE UP I'M NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ROUTES TO WOULD DETAIL THE BILL MY TAKE ON AT SOME POINT- GIVEN MY OWN CONCERNS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS YOURS- HAD THE BEEN THE SAME I MIGHT'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE YOUR YOUR READ- OPPOSITION WITNESS MYSELF. I MEAN YOU READ SUPPORT WITNESSES SKEWS ME- BECAUSE I DO HAVE CONCERNS TONIGHT IN THAT IN THAT VEIN I APPRECIATE THE ISSUE BEING ELEVATED- AND- I WILL JUST SAY AT THE OUTSET ARE MOVING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO. DEVELOP IT FURTHER BUT- I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE IT'S GOING IN TERMS OF DETAIL ON IT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A CONCERN FOR SOME FOLKS- IT'LL BE ON MY COMMENTS TODAY I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT YOU'RE CERTAINLY. WELCOME TO RESPOND LET ME IN WHEN YOU CLOSE BUT LET ME BRING IT BACK I'M NOT ASKING FOR A RESPONSE RIGHT NOW LET ME BRING IT BACK TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR ANY COMMENTS THAT THEY HAVE- CENTER NEWMAN AND CENTER DRAWS ON. AND THEY WILL COME TO CENTER WHERE HE HAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ANSWERED I DO APPRECIATE. NOT JUST WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE. YOU'RE BRINGING TO OUR ATTENTION. MY ANALYSIS- CAN. WILL THAT SORT OF. THE FROM THE CA INTEREST THEY WERE THEY WERE PROP. HAVE TO BE CONSTANT. PROVISIONS ADOPTED FOR THIS BILL THE SUCCESS TO BECOME LAW AND SO THERE'S NO OPPOSITION SO. WOULD YOU MIND SPEAKING OF ISSUE CANCER THE FULLER UNDERSTANDINGS AND MAKE MY PHONE. WELL I'M NOT A I'M NOT TO FAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LEGISLATURE BEING EXEMPT FROM LABOR LAWS WE ARE WE ARE EXEMPTED FROM THEM BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T TAKEN ACTION TO. INCLUDE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE'VE EXEMPTED THOSE EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS. THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS. UNDER THE LAW SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DON'T PAY THEM OVERTIME WHEN THEY WORKED TWELVE HOUR DAY. WITH THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO COME TO THE LEGISLATORS I HATE DEMAND JUST LIKE IT MY EMPLOYEES OF MY BUSINESS WOULD GO TO THE LABOR BOARD. AND SAY HEY MY EMPLOYER DID NOT. I WORK THESE HOURS AND THEY DIDN'T PAY ME AND THEN THE LABOR WARD WOULD COME AFTER ME THE LABOR BOARD DOESN'T COME OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY DON'T ABIDE BY THE LAW BECAUSE THEY'VE EXEMPTED THEMSELVES FROM THE XACT LAWS THAT THEY PASSED. SO I'M NOT. FOR MIGLIOR WITH. ANY CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THAT'S NOT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BUT I WOULD. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO LOOK INTO IT IF THAT'S THE CASE AND MAYBE WE NEED TO PUT ON THE BALLOT. M. OKAY SO I GUESS THAT'S- HI STEVE MY QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED I APPRECIATE. THE SENTIMENTS OF THE WILL MOVE ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN- DESCENDED ROSY WERE NEXT AND THEN CENTER ALERT. THANK YOU AND I- THANK TO APPRECIATE RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE STAFF- I- I DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE THEN I WOULD NEED A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN. WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED CURRENTLY. BY THE STATE TO OUR OUR OUR STAFF AND WHAT. THEY'RE LACKING- AS FAR AS EITHER RIGHT OR- BENEFITS OR HOURLY. I DON'T THINK THE I THINK THE IT THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE US OVER TIME THAT'S REALLY BASED ON MINIMUM WAGE SO- IT'S- KIND OF EASY FOR MOST EMPLOYEES FOR MOST OF. THE SAY THAT THEY'RE GETTING PAID OVERTIME BUT IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE I THINK OF WHAT'S NEEDED MORE CLARITY IS NEEDED- AND I JUST DON'T KNOW OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE FOR MOST IF NOT YOU KNOW OVERWHELMINGLY. MINIMUM WAGE IS LESS AN ISSUE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COVERED BY HE STATE- I PREFER. OF SURPRISE SURPRISE AB NINE SIX NINE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ'S BILL OF WHICH I'M A CO AUTHOR OF WHICH SAYS. I WILL BE EXTENDED- ON A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS SO THAT THEY CAN DECIDE ALONG WITH US AS THE EMPLOYER WHAT'S MISSING WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED- SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY THAT'S BEEN. IN MY OPINION THE BEST WAY OF DEALING WITH ANYBODY'S ALL WORKING CONDITIONS IS LEFT EMPLOYEES AND THE EMPLOYER DECIDE WHERE AND WHAT AND HOW MUCH IT BECAUSE THAT WHAT'S NEEDED AND WHAT'S NOT NEEDED. THANK YOU. PLEASE ROSE. WELL I WAS GONNA SAY THE CENTER INVALID TOOK ALL THE FUN OUT OF THIS. WITH HIS PRESENTATION I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM AS A LEAD QUESTION HOW MANY TIMES HE'D BEEN IN FRONT OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE IN EIGHT YEARS AND HE DID VOLUNTEER THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. I WAS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL MAY DAY PICNIC AT THE DALI RANCH UP IN THE PAPER. I THINK THAT STILL MIGHT BE ON. A IN A IT IS THE REAL THING IS I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE COMMENTS THAT THE CHAIR AND SENATOR DURAZO SAID AND I'M GOING TO FOR THIS BILL AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO WORK ON IT BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN OUT POINT AND THEIR CONCERNS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDERING MOVING TO FILL. OTHERS NUMBER TWO. YES I WANNA THANK US SENATOR DOLLY FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD I THINK THIS IS WHERE- I ADMIRE THE FACT THAT WHEN. LEADERS TAKE INITIATIVE OR IN THIS CASE THE ELECTED- OR ANY BUSINESS OWNER TAKES INITIATIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT AND PROVIDING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS- OPTIMAL. OUT FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND REALLY PUTS FORWARD THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'S THAT IT'S A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT WE HAVE THE EMPLOYERS AND WE HAVE THE EMPLOYEES AND THEY NEED EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. IN IN AN- IN THEIR ENDEAVOR SO- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO MOVE P. THE THIS BILL FORD. WHEN THE TIME COMES. OKAY THE TIME SHOULD BE COMING VERY SHORTLY- CENTER DOLLY- YOU'RE WELCOME TO CLOSE% AT THIS TIME. PERSONAL I WANT TO. THANK THE MEMBERS AND GREAT COMMENTS I DO I AND I APPRECIATE- CENTER LAYERED HE'S IN ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE- IT IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN FROM THIS COMMITTEE BUT- AS AN EMPLOYER I. I AGREE I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY EMPLOYEES AND IS A TWO WAY STREET AND THERE ARE MANY LOST MANY MANY LAWS THAT ARE BURDENSOME LOS- AND ALL HAVE BEEN PASSED FOR A GOOD REASON IF YOU REALLY DIG INTO THE LAWS AND FIND OUT THERE SOME ABUSES ABSOLUTELY. ON ON ALL SIDES OF LOS. BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE CAPITAL I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY IN THE FACT THAT. OUR OFFICES DON'T ABIDE BY THE LAWS THAT WE PASS. AND YOU KNOW WE HEAR A LOT OF SPEECHES ON THE FLOOR ABOUT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT. HOW THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT. SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRONG AWRY- RIGHT OR WRONG THEY SHOULD SAY GET THAT RIGHT- AND THERE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT THAT'S JUST WAS NEW TO MY V. BROUGHT UP TO ME. AND I'LL SHARE THAT IT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE- IF YOU'RE MAKING. WE DON'T PAY ANY OF OUR EMPLOYERS MINIMUM WAGE WE PAY ABOVE THAT UP SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT THAT BUT WE ARE STILL REQUIRED BY LAW. TO PAY. TIME TIME AND A HALF ON CERTAIN OUT WHEN THEY MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS YOU PAY SO- I KNOW THAT THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT OUR MINIMUM WAGE I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE I MEAN I KNOW IT'S MORE THAN THAT. BUT DINNER THE DAY THEY SHOULD STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO. YOU KNOW WE PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR IN THE- SENATE SENATOR JACKSON BROUGHT THE BILL FORWARD ABOUT. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE TO OUR LEAVE. AND YOU COULD CONSECUTIVE THAT FOR FIFTEEN WEEKS TWO HOURS AT A TIME. AND THAT BILL PASSED AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK ARE EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE. HAVE THE RIGHT TO AS WELL AND SO- FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THE BILL AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE- TO GET ME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MOVE ON AND I WILL LOOK UP ALL THOSE CONCERNS AND TRY TO GET YOU BETTER INFORMATION- AS WE TAKE. THIS JOURNEY THROUGH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH A ROLL CALL VOTE NO OF THE CONSULTANT WOULD DO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. SENATOR CORTEZ. HI AND THE COURT HAS THE AYE. SENATOR OCHO BUG I. UNDER CHAU BOGAN HIGH SENATOR ALSO. SENATOR DORADO AYE SENATOR LAYERED I SENATOR LAYERED HI SENATOR NEWMAN ALL RIGHT SENATOR NEWMAN AYE. MOTION PASSES OF FIVE TWO ZERO THAT BUILDS UP THANK YOU. THE YES BUT I LOOKED AT THE NEXT BILL HONOR GENDER IS SB SEVEN HUNDRED- THAT A SENATOR DROWSINESS BILL AND THE SENATE RUSSELL YOU MAY STAY IN PLACE IF YOU PREFER ON THE DAIS- POLITICAL WITH PROTOCOLS IN PLACE AND- YOU ARE CERTAINLY WELCOME TO PRESENT THIS TIME. OKAY MAKE SURE OKAY THREE. SEVEN HUNDRED OKAY- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF A ARE COMMITTEE- SB SEVEN HUNDRED IS ABOUT MISCLASSIFIED PORT DRIVERS HAVING ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS- ALL MY LIFE AND IN MY CAREER I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS AND IT BENEFITS THE FAMILIES BECAUSE A PARENT LOSES THEIR JOB. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THE FAMILY CN KEEP THEIR HOME OR NOT BE BIG THAT OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STATE'S SAFETY NET. BUT EVEN THIS ONE VERY MODEST PROTECTION HAS BEEN DENIED TO PORT TRUCK DRIVERS AS THE PANDEMIC KIT. AND THE AMOUNT OF CARGO IN THE PORTS DROPPED MANY MANY DRIVERS FOUND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY APPLIED FOR BENEFITS MANY WERE DENIED EVEN WORSE SOME OF THOSE CLASSIFIED DRIVERS WERE DEEMED TO BE EMPLOYERS. OF OTHER DRIVERS MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR UNEMPLOYED YOU WHY TAXES INSTEAD OF. THE COMPANIES PROFITING FROM THEIR WORK. NOW WE KNOW THAT COMPANIES USE SOME COMPANIES USE ELABORATE SCHEMES TO MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS ESPECIALLY IN PORT DRAYAGE. THE LABEL WORKERS AS SEPARATE BUSINESSES LEASE THEM TRACKS AND THEN TELL THEM TO FIND OTHER DRIVERS- OTHER WORKERS TO DRIVE OTHER SHIFTS ALL OF THIS IS MEANT TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF INDEPENDENCE WHEN REALITY THE WORKERS UNDER THE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE TRUCKING COMPANY- SO I BELIEVE IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR STATE AGENCIES TO SEE BEYOND. THESE FRAUD SCHEMES TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WORKERS WERE BEING HARMED. ON EIGHTY D. DECISIONS AT THE VERY FIRST LEVEL ARE DENYING BENEFITS AND THE PROLONGED AW THE AND THEY DELAYED ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING GOODS THROUGH THE PORT HE D. D.

AND WHEN IT WHEN I COMMITTEES AT THAT ADDRESSES PROBLEMS WITH THE PORRIDGE- IS FOUR ZERO DRIVERS. IT SOMETIMES FEELS LIKE WE'RE PLAYING A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE WHERE WHERE THE EMPLOYERS OR THE- THE FOLKS WHO. HAVE THE BUSINESS- DEPLOY ALL KINDS OF STRATAGEMS TO REDUCE THE WAGES OF THE WORKERS- AND OTHERWISE DEPRIVE THEM OF PROTECTIONS AND IT'S SORT OF IRONIC BECAUSE THE POOREST. IT'S NOT A SMALL BUSINESS AND IT'S NOT AN UNPROFITABLE BUSINESS. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- AND I'M GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE BROADER SOLUTION. OF SYSTEMICALLY ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM SO WE'RE NOT ALWAYS TRYING TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AS A THANK YOU TO SEND A BROWSER TO RUSSIA FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND IF I COULD I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A- CO AUTHOR. MOVIE FOR. THANK YOU CENTER NEW. OTHER COM ARE. ON THE DAIS- THE SCENE. MEMBERS YOUR YES. ONE SENATOR. IRAN'S I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. I HAVE- HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WOULD- SIR THE AJIJIC CARE TORE A JUDY CARE TORY SORRY PROCESS CONTEMPLATED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE FOR C. Y. A. B. DECISIONS TO BECOME PRESIDENT. WELL- MAYBE THEM- ARE WITNESS- EXTRA WINGS COULD ANSWER BUT I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING. IT WILL FIT WE'RE NOT SKIPPING ANYTHING OR BY PASSING ANY PROCESS THE- RIGHT NOW WHAT'S GOING ON IS AT THE VERY BOTTOM LEVEL THE EDT IS DECIDING- TO DENY THESE- PORT TRUCKERS THE U. I. BENEFITS AND IN FACT BLAMES THEM. BUT THEN AS THE DISEASE AS THE CASE GOES UP IT HAS TO BE ONE BY ONE- APPEALED AS THE CASES GO UP THEY GET OVERTURNED ON THE RIGHT DECISION IS MADE SO WE'RE NOT BY PASSING ANYTHING WE WANT TO CLARIFY AND SAY. ENOUGH WOULD BE LAYING THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO ALL THEY WANT IS THE MINIMAL WAY MINIMAL ON ONE OF A MINIMAL- BENEFITS OF OUR SAFETY NET THEY JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT SOME UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE THEY'RE OFF OF WORK SO WE'RE NOT BYPASS IN ANYTHING. IT'S ESTABLISHED BY THE APPEALS COURT ALREADY OVER AND OVER WE JUST WANT TO SAY AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR THE INITIAL DECISION IS MADE THAT THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THESE PARTICULAR TO COURT DECISIONS FOLLOW THEM SO THAT THOSE WERE THOSE BOND TRUCKERS COULD GET THEIR. BENEFITS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF- WITH THE- ADMIN LAW TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. THIS IS THE- SURE. SURE I THANK YOU AS THE NEW ADDRESS A YES- THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HERE THE JEWS SURFING ANY EDUCATED TEACHER CORPS YOU COULD TRY TO PROCESS. YOU I. A. B. HAS ROLLED AND HAS FOUND THAT TRUCKING COMPANIES ARE THE EMPLOYER AND IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE CAN FIND BE POURED INTO THE DRIVERS SHOULD BE THE EMPLOYERS AND FORCING IMPLICATE PAYROLL TAXES. AND WE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE A REQUEST WE WANT TO THE PROCESS THAT YOU AYE A BEAT TO MAKE THE DECISION TO PRESIDENTIAL AND THAT IS PENDING. ON IT AND THIS LEGISLATION AT THE SAME TIME SO CRITICAL BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY OF THE PREDICAMENT OF DRIVERS WHO ARE BLOCKED THE STAFF PAYROLL TAXES AND BEEN DENIED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ALL TAXES MEANWHILE THE XPO'S OF THE WORLD THE CONTAINER CONNECTIONS OF THE WORLD THE UNIVERSAL DOESN'T COUNTY THE WORLD OVER THE PAYROLL TAXES TO THE MUCH NEEDED COFFERS OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND ARE GETTING OFF SCOT FREE SO. LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NEEDED THE DRIVERS ARE FRUSTRATED STRIKE ACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED LAST WEEK AND I AM CONFIDENT MORE. WILL HAPPEN IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU. AGAIN TO THE WITNESS FOR AFFECT. OF HE STORE BEFORE NUMBER. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- ANOTHER FOR YOU SO. EDUCATE ME ON WHAT BIT IN FOR ME UNDER BECAUSE SOME OF THE TRUCKERS I HAVE MET WITH OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEY WANT TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. OUR PORT TRUCKERS. NOT AUTONOMOUS IN THEIR IN THEIR IF YOU MAKING AS FAR AS WORK AND HOW LONG THEY WORK AND WHAT THEY DO IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND I'M NOT SURE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRUCKERS THAT THEY ARE BUT IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PORT TRUCKERS AND- OTHER. TRUCKERS WELL. I'M NOT THERE IS DIFFERENCES I'M SURE BETWEEN TRUCKERS OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES BUT HERE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS A SYSTEMATIC ABUSE OF MIS CLASSIFYING. PORT TRUCKERS WHO ARE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THAT'S THE SCHEME FOR THE EMPLOYER TO GET OUT OF PLAY PAIN ALL THE THINGS. THAT I'M AN EMPLOYER IS NORMALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION OR- DISABILITY YOU CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON SO AS LONG AS THEY MISCLASSIFIED THAT TRUCKER AS A AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THE EMPLOYER THE TROOP LAWYER DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE PAY FOR ALL THOSE THINGS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S BECOME SUCH A- ON INDUSTRY SCHEME FAR MORE THAN OTHER INDUSTRIES THEY'VE MADE THAT THE MODEL- I HAVE SOME NOTES ABOUT THEIR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY LABOR COMMISSIONER DECISIONS. WITH OVER FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN UNPAID WAGES AND DAMAGES THESE ARE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE BY OUR STATE AGENCIES SAYING THERE IS ON THE BEAUCE HERE. BY MISS CLASSIFYING THESE PORT TRUCKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS I'M SURE THERE MAY BE SOME FALL WITHIN OF THE PORT TRUCKERS THAT ARE TRULY MEET THE TEST OF WHAT IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT IN THIS CASE THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY EMPLOYEES THEY'RE NOT OVERWHELMINGLY. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND IT'S JUST A SCHEME. WITH THIS BILL. A FOR AT ALL THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO WISH TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS PORT TRUCKERS IF IT THIS IS THESE ARE PORT TRUCKERS WHO TAKE THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. SO IF THEY ARE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT YOU KNOW THIS IS THOSE UP BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS IT FACTUALLY THE COMPLAINT IS MADE AND THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN. ODD TO- JUSTIFIED MISS CLASSIFICATION THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE COURT'S DECISIONS AND QUIT MAKING EVERYBODY GOAL ONE BY ONE OF THE APPEALS COURT. SO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EACH INDEPENDENT AT PORT TRUCKER IN ORDER TO OR WHEN TEY MAKE THE CLAIMS. FOR EDT. YEAH OF YES THEY THEY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS. IF YOU'RE IN THE IF YOU'RE TRULY AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND YOU DON'T FILE A COMPLAINT THAT'S NOT OUR CONCERN. MY CONCERN IS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE SAYING THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEY AREN'T MISSED- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEY ARE IN FACT EMPLOYEES. AND ULTIMATELY AFTER THEY GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LITIGATION PROCESS THE DECISION IS THAT YES THEY ARE EMPLOYEES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED. THE U. Y. BENEFITS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU ANYTHING ANYTHING ELSE FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. A C. NINE NINE COMPACT USER GROWTH OF HER CLOTHES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO PURGE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THOSE MISCLASSIFIED PORT TRUCKERS UNDERAGE AND I BOTH THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO FOR ALL YOUR GOOD WORK IN THIS AREA AND- THANK YOU.

SORRY COLLUSION IS. TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR COURTESY HI. SENATOR CORTEZ III CENTER- CHAU BOKE HI. SENATOR CHAU BOCA HI SENATOR TORONTO. SENATOR ALSO AVE SENATOR LAYERED. AND LAYARD AVE SENATOR NEWMAN. SENATOR NEWMAN AYE. IDENTIFIER THE QUOTE WAS A FIVE TWO ZERO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE BILL ITSELF. THANK YOU. MOVING ON NOW URBANIST TO BILLS WILL BE PRESENTED BY SENATOR LIEBERMAN SEE THAT SHE'S HERE WELCOME CENTRAL ASIA AND UNDERSTAND TO BE PRESENT ON S. B. FOURTEEN. AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE SECOND WHILE I GET MY NOTES. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TODAY I PRESENT AS BEFORE TEN TO ENSURE THAT WORKER SAFETY IS NEVER DELAYED OR CERTIFIED AS A RESULT OF DUPLICATIVE EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY ANALYSIS. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW SB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES TO PREPARE AN IN DEPTH ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF ANY REGULATION WITH AN ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS ECONOMIC ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IS CALLED THE STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHARIA. WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH REFORMS WE'RE ALL ALREADY AWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE PRACTICES THAT FINALIZED THOSE STEPS INCLUDE. OFTEN A BILL SIGNED INTO LAW DIRECTING CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD. O. S. H. B. TO TAKE ACTION ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEE HEARINGS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT WHICH WILL FURTHER ACCESS TO FIGHT FISCAL IMPACT. THE O. S. H. S. B. THEM EXTENSIVELY REVIEWS THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ANY STANDARD. BY THIS POINT AT LEAST FOR FEDERAL FISCAL ANALYSES HAVE BEEN DONE AND HAVE OCCURRED FOR THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO BE COMPLETED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SHRIYA REVIEWS REVIEW MANDATE A FIFTH PHYSICAL FISCAL ANALYSIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS ALREADY THOROUGH PROCESS. THREE CAN EXTEND THE RULE MAKING PROCESS BY ONE TO TWO YEARS OR EVEN MORE IN TURN TO CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE WORKPLACE. A FURTHER DELAY IN ADOPTING SAFETY MATT STANDARDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AND I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE LOWER LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW. MAY PLACE WORKERS AT AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. POSIBLES BUT DO REQUIRE. SUCH AS INDOOR HEAT THE STANDARD REQUIRED BY SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE TO SEVERE DELAYS AS WE WILL RESULT OF THIS PROCESS. MANY WORKERS ARE STILL IN JEOPARDY ON THE JOB. THE LANGUAGE FOR THE INDOOR HEAT STANDARD HAS YET TO EVEN BE PRESENTED TO THE O. S. H. S. B. DESPITE LEGISLATION REQUIRING THIS TO HAPPEN OVER TWO YEARS AGO. THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO ADDITIONAL YEARS THUS FAR THE INDOOR WORKERS HAVE LABORED IN GRUELING HEAT WITH NO CLEAR HE PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. FOR THE PANDEMIC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THIS DELAY IN JANUARY TWO ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEADLINE WAS ALREADY LONG GONE WHEN CODE APPEARED OVER ONE YEAR LATER. ALSO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED AND A SIX A SEVEN MONTH PROP- PROCESS ONE PROTECTING WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AND ANOTHER FROM COVERED NINETEEN. AS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THESE DID NOT REQUIRE SHARIA BUT THE REGULATIONS TO RECEIVED THOROUGH VETTING WITH PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGENCIES TO ANALYZE AND STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK. THESE AND OTHER EXPERIENCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SRI BRINGS LITTLE TO THE WORKER SAFETY RULE MAKING PROCESS OTHER THAN GREATER DELAYS INFLATED STATE COSTS WITH MORE INJURIES ILLNESSES AND FATALITIES. I WOULD ARGUE THAT SHARIA CAN MAKE WORKERS LESS SAFE. AS SUCH AS BEFORE TEN EXEMPTS CAL OSHA FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM SHRIYA ON ANY PROPOSED MAJOR REGULATION WITH A PROJECTED FISCAL IMPACT OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. ALL OTHER EXISTING LAYERS OF REVIEW INCLUDING INTERNAL FISCAL ANALYSIS THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC HEARINGS AND MEETINGS AND THE FEDERAL MAKING PROCESS WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. THIS BILL REFLECTS THE EXCEPTIONALLY DETAILED FISCAL ANALYSIS THAT ALREADY OCCURS AT CAL OSHA AND ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO FOCUS SCARCE RESOURCES AND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS. A PATH ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH BEEN SUPPORTED IS MUCH SNIDER OF THE LABOR FEDERATION WHEN APPROPRIATE MEMBERS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR A LEYVA. NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR WE HAVE. MITCH TIGER AND JUST ONE I CAN DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED- IS MUCH STRONGER ON THE LINE. A PLANT. PLEASE PRESS FOR YOU- SURE. SURE MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL THAT IS. ARE ABOUT MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER AND PROPHETICALLY IN THE CASE ALLOWING THIS ONE AGENCY TO WORK FASTER AND AT LESS COST WHILE IN NO WAY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE PROCESS. AND THAT IS CALLOSUM ABOUT ALLOWING THESE REGULATIONS TO GET IN PLACE FASTER IN A WAY THAT WILL PREVENT INJURIES AND ILLNESSES AND ABSOLUTELY SAVE LIVES. UNDER LABEL REALLY COVERED ALL THE MAIN POINTS BUT WE WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON THAT EXAMPLE OF INDOOR HEAT AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS BILL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. WHEN THE BUILDER FELLOWSHIP AND THE STANDARDS BOARD TO ADOPT AN INDOOR HEAT REGULATION WAS APPROVED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. HELLO JUST STARTED THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS QUICKLY AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I HAD. SEVERAL OF THESE MEETINGS TO IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE WAS NO LIMIT WHATSOEVER ON THE ABILITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO WAY AND- THERE ARE NO TIME LIMITS YOU COULD. TURN IN A LETTER THAT WAS AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHATEVER KIND OF COST IMPACT THAT ANYONE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT AND HE DID WE GOT. VERY DETAILED IN THE ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MONITORS THE CONSTANT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAINING. AND ALL THOSE ISSUES WERE COVERED VERY THOROUGHLY. AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WERE PROPOSED. BY MY COUNT EIGHT DIFFERENT VERSIONS THAT WERE FLOATED OUT THERE EACH WITH. UP TIME FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO WEIGH IN ON AFTER THE FACT AND- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS HOW ALL OTHER AGENCIES DO IT BUT WITH CALLOSUM. ANYONE OF THESE MAJOR REGULATIONS ALWAYS HAS ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE TOUCH TO IT UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY REGULATION. AND ALSO ALL THAT PRODUCE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEEN FINALIZED IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THEN IT'S JUST BEEN SITTING THERE. AND THEN WORKERS HAVE BEEN WAITING AND SUFFERING THROUGH THE HAZARD FOR TWO YEARS. BUT NO SOLUTION WELL THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETED BUT WE ALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CONSULTANT TO COMPLETE A PEDIA. AND SINCE THEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST SIXTY SIX ZERO INDOOR HEAT RELATED COMPLAINT. AND THAT'S WITHOUT A STANDARD AND QUITE. SO IN MOST CASES THE EMPLOYER WAS PROBABLY NOT TECHNICALLY DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL YET. BUT THE WORKERS WERE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE. WHEN I HADN'T ACCEPTED THE RISK OF RETALIATION. AND CALLED CALIBRATION ANYWAY. AND YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS THAT THREE ARE WITH. THEY'RE VERY INTEREST. VERY HELPFUL DOC. BY WHAT THEIR VALUE IS. ARE YOU IN THE WE BELIEVE LAST THE VALUE OF A WERE LIFE. AND MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT THE THAT. THIS IS WERE MADE WHEN WE ARE SOME LIKE THAT TO DELAY OR SAFETY RIGHT BY ONE TO TWO YEARS WE'RE SAYING THAT THE CULPABLE. OF WORKERS TO GET HURT BUT WORKERS TO DIE WHILE WE WAIT FOR THIS DOCUMENT TO BE PREPARED. WE THINK THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WE THINK THAT THIS BILL OFFERS A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION THAT WILL SAVE MONEY THAT WILL IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL ABSOLUTELY SAVE WORKERS. LIVES WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK VERY MUCH. THAT IS BRIDGE TIGER IN LEAD SUPPORT. SB FOUR TEN WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE DO WE HAVE.

THIRTY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN MADAM CHAIR THERE ARE NO QUICK NO- LINES IN Q. THANK YOU MODERATOR HAVING HEARD FOM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. WE DO HAVE ONE LEAD UP. THREE THIRTY. AND WE DO HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS THAT IS MISTER ROBERT NO TREE FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MISTER MO TREAT- ARE YOU ON THE LINE- YES MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED SIR- THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT MACHINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ALONG WITH THE COALITION ARE OPPOSED BEFORE CAN- I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY THE ISSUE UP FRONT. WHO RECOGNIZED THE CONCERNS I'M THAT ANALYSIS AND TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT MEASURES ALWAYS TAKE TIME THE REPEATED HEARING OF LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE DRAFTING IT OUT BY STAFF. ALL OF THOSE STEPS TAKE TIME THEY SLOW DOWN LEGISLATION JUST LIKE REGULATIONS BUT WE SEE THOSE UNHEALTHY AND THAT THAT PROCESS AND VALUABLE BECAUSE THE RESULT IN BETTER POLICY. I WOULD BE THE SAME WITH THE SERIE A PROCESS- I'D LIKE TO GET THAT THE TWO I THINK THE BIG ISSUES HERE RIGHT I THAT FIRST THE VALUE OF THE THREE OF PROCESS- FOR BRIEF CONTACT- THOROUGHLY THE ACCURATE NUMBER I THREE AT- BASIC PREMISE MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS FOR REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- I DO WHICH IS WHY DID WAS CREATE RECENTLY UNDER AT. SIX SEVENTEEN I THOUGHT OUR CALDERON THAT- AND ONE MEASURE OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A FACT IT- WE CAN LOOK AT THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE L. A- THE OFFICE. PUT OUT A REVIEW OF THE JURY A PROCESS AND COMMENTED AND I'M QUOTING WE FIND SOME OF THE CHANGES HERE HAVE LED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY OF. AGENCIES ANALYSIS OF MAJOR REGULATION. BY YOU THE L. A. R. THANK THE THREE OF THAT HAVE. PROVED THE THAT. AND TO THE TO THE POINT MADE BY THE PROPONENT IS BIT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. CAN IN OTHER PRETTY GOOD THING OUT. UNANSWERED STAFF NOW NOTE THE POINT THE ONE ASSEMBLY. IS THAT. BUT APART OF FINANCE HAS TO REVIEW. AND COMMENT ON SURREY ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY IT THE METHODOLOGY THE CALCULATIONS ARE ESSENTIALLY. CORRECT IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO CALCULATE WHAT IT'S GONNA DO THE TO THE ECONOMY WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE WILL COST. AND IF YOU LOOK AT U. S. WEBSITE YOU CAN VIEW THE OTHER DELAY IN MANY CASES WILL PUSH BACK AND SAY NO AGENTS YOU'VE DONE THIS MATH ROCK. NO CHANGE THERE SO TO THE IDEA THAT WITHOUT THE PRODUCT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME DATA JUST AS WELL I THINK THAT IT'S- IT'S PROVEN. BY DLF WEIGHING IN ON REGULATIONS. THAT HAVING TO CHANGE THE CALCULATION- ALL IT IS EXAMPLE- WE TALK THREE THE THING OUT THERE AND- L. Y. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT WHICH IS LITERALLY A FIVE PAGE. CHECK THE BOX FORM WHICH AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO DO WITH YOU IF YOU GET RESTORING AS ALTERNATIVE. THAT DID NOT COME ANYWHERE NEAR THE DEPTH OF SERBIAN AL PACINO- YOU KNOW COULD BE A HUNDRED PAGES. OF AND GO TO INDUSTRY TO INDUSTRY CALCULATION. CALCULATION ARE YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IS JUST NOT CAPTURED OTHER PLACES SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT VALUE. IT'S. CERTAINLY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS- THE LAST THE TOUCH ID LIKE TO ME- I THINK MR STEIGER MENTIONED IT SHOULD THE ISSUE OF HELLO SHOULD THREE AT THE TYPICALLY GOING SLOW WAITING ON A CONSOLE TO BE PRECISE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAVE TAKEN SOME TIME IT BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFIC OUTSIDE CONSULTING COMPANY CALLUSES CHOSEN TO CONTRACT WITH AND THEIR WORKLOAD. BUT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH SHARIA OR THE VALUE OF SERBIA ECONOMICALLY- INDEED THAT IS A CONSTANT ISSUE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE CONSULTANT THE CALLOUS HAS CONTRACTED WITH AND I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF ISSUE WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM NOW THIS IS A VALUE BUT IT DOES HAVE A CONTRACTING ISSUE- INTAKE BACK ISN'T A REASON TO THROW OUT THIS VALUABLE ECONOMIC TOOL AND INDEED I THINK THAT THEY AT AT MISTER SPEAKER NOTED IT IS A VALUABLE ECONOMIC IT OUT THESE OTHERWISE THE BILL WOULD BE GETTING RID OF IT FOR ALL AGENCIES THAT DOESN'T DO THAT RIGHT ONLY BECAUSE THE FOR CAL OSHA. I THINK THAT IN ITSELF ALSO UNDERLINED THE VALUE THREE SO WHILE WE ARE WHAT WE AGREED IT DELAYED BEEN DEREGULATION THEY'RE NOT IDEAL BUT WE THINK THE VALUE OF SHARIA INSIGNIFICANT AND DINNER. HE MAINTAINED A CALLOUS. EVEN AS WE ARE. AT THE TAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS. LET'S MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES AND UP OF AS- FOR TEN. IN ROOM FOR FORTY TWO OR THREE DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. TWO THREE FOUR TEN SEE NONE ARE THERE ANY WITH-THIS IS A ROOM TWENTY FORTY IN OPPOSITION SB TEN. SEEN NONE.

TRUST FROM PAYMENTS AND CARRY WORKERS COMPENSATION REQUIRE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE A THIRTY DAY NOTICE OF A VIOLATION TO THE DIRECT CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR ALLOWING THEM TO CURE THE VIOLATION DURING THAT PERIOD. ALSO TO REQUIRE THAT NOTICE BE FILED WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD WHICH WILL TRACK THE WAGE THAT VIOLATION ON THE ORIGINAL EMPLOYERS LICENSE AND JOINT LIABILITY FOR WAGE VIOLATION PENALTIES MAY APPLY IF THREE NOTICES ARE FILED. WITH THE C. L. C. S. WILL BE WITHIN A THREE YEAR PERIOD. WITHOUT SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN AIMS TO PREVENT WAGE THEFT WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY. AND TO HELP THOSE THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE PAID ON TIME. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUILT OUR WORLD CAT CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF A GROWING CALIFORNIA POPULATION. DUE TO THE SKILLS REQUIRED AND THE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKERS RECEIVED THE INDUSTRY PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO COULD THEN AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE HOME. THAT THEY BUILT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MORE FORTY. THOSE HAVE BEEN GARAGE. ERODING ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA. OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE FAMILIES CURRENTLY FALL INTO LOW INCOME CATEGORY. LESS THAN OVER ONE THIRD OF ALL CONSTRUCTION FAMILIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS VERY LOW INCOME EARNING LESS THAN 50% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. LIKE MANY OTHER SECTORS CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN THE WAGE THEFT IN CASH PAYMENTS HAVE ALSO INCREASED. A KEY FACTOR FOR THIS IS A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF BASIC LABOR LAWS ON THE JOB SITE. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES. AND HAVE ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER ON ITS CONTRACTORS AND UNDERMINED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. LABOR SHORTAGES IN CONSTRUCTION ARE LARGELY CONCENTRATED IN LOW WAGE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY. I DO NOT NEED TO GO INTO DETAIL WHY THAT IS DANNY CURTAIN WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY WE'LL DO THAT. BUT I WILL SHARE THAT WILL SEVENTEEN OH ONE BY FUHRMAN WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS MADE SOME DIFFERENCES IT IS NOT DONE ENOUGH SOME CONTRACTORS STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT TO JUST BE A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. COLLEAGUES AT THIS TIME THAT WE TREAT WAITSTAFF IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SIMILAR TO HOW WE TREAT IT AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE NECESSARY FORSMAN TOOLS TO EFFECTIVELY DETER CONTINUED WAGE THEFT BY ENSURING THAT DIRECT CONTRACTORS NO LONGER IGNORE THE VIOLATIONS OF THE SUBCONTRACTORS THEY HIRE. WITH THEIR PROJECTS FOR THE PROJECTS HERE WITH ME TODAY IS DANNY CURTAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF CARPENTERS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR- MR CURTAIN THANK YOU SENATE LABOR AND THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE- MEMBERS. ALTERNATIVE REPEAT SOME OF THE STUFF FROM THE SENATE DELIVER SAID BUT I'LL DO MY BEST. IN THE TIME ALLOTTED I WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS AND PERHAPS AT THE END IF I DON'T GET THROUGH ALL THIS YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS. HOW BAD THE WAGE THAT PROBLEM ACTUALLY IS SENATE LABORTOUCHED ON THAT THE DAMAGE IS CREATED ON THE WORK FORCE AND HONEST CONTRACTORS. HOW POOR THE ENFORCEMENT IS A HUNDRED YEARS OF LEGAL PRECEDENT FOR JOINT LIABILITY THE LEGAL PRECEDENT NOW THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE WHY THE DIRECT CONTRACTOR SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. THE HOUSING CRISIS. CANNOT BE SOLVED WITH UNSKILLED UNMOTIVATED IMPOVERISHED WORKERS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S BUREAU FIELD ENFORCEMENT DESCRIBED THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AS RAMPANT WIDESPREAD UNCONSTRAINED OUT OF CONTROL. THE CONCENTRATED IN FOR INTEREST IT'S CONCENTRATED IN FOR INDUSTRIES CONSTRUCTION AGRICULTURE RESTAURANT AND GARMENT I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND SENATOR DORADO FIRST SB SIXTY TWO ASSEMBLY JOINT LABOR LIABILITY BILL FOR THE GARMENT INDUSTRY THAT WAS PASSED ABOUT A MONTH AGO. THINK OF CONSTRUCTION IS A STACK OF FOUR CATEGORIES ALL RELATIVELY SIMILAR IN SIZE THIS IS IMPORTANT ALL ABOUT THE SAME SIZE THE TOP TWO CATEGORIES INCLUDE PUBLIC WORKS. AND THE LARGER MORE COMPLEX PRIVATE PROJECTS. UNION AND NONUNION CONTRACTORS COMPETE FOR THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS THEY NEED TO BUILD THESE PROJECTS. PUBLIC WORKS REQUIRES THE MOST RIGOROUS STANDARDS TO ATTRACT AND KEEP WORKERS ON THE PRIVATE JOBS CONTRACTORS HAVE TO MEET OR COME CLOSE TO MATCHING PUBLIC WORK STANDARDS. THAT'S A HEALTHY COMPETITION AND A TOUGH MARKET PLACE. THE BOTTOM HALF IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. I WAS CONTRACTORS THE PLAY BY THE RULES IN THE LOW WAGE NONUNION SECTOR. COMPETE WITH A BOTTOM FEEDERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WHERE THE RULES GO OUT THE WINDOW THEY FACE CASH PAID LABOR BROKERS PEACE WORK. NO OVERTIME PAY AND WORST OF ALL. OFTEN NO PAYROLL RECORDS. THAT'S A CANCEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE COMPETITION IN A VICIOUS MARKET PLACE IT DRIVES WAGES AND WORKING FISHING CONDITIONS OF THE BOTTOM. WORKERS HAVE NO SAY NO CHOICE AND A CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. I'M A CONTRACTOR FOR DRIVEN OF BUSINESS. IN THE LAST FIVE DECADES THE BOTTOM FEEDERS IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY HAVE INCREASED OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. IT'S CREATED A SUB CLASS OF WORKERS KEPT IN POVERTY. FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MARKET PLACE CRIME DOES PAY. ACCORDING TO CENSUS DATA. SENATE LABOR TOUCHED ON. THE LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME OR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME OR THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION MARKET. IN THE UPPER HALF OF THE MARKET PLACE THAT'S RARELY% THE CASE. IN THE BOTTOM HALF THEY MAKE LESS THAN FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO WORKERS IN THE FORMAL HONEST ECONOMY. THE FURTHER DOWN YOU GO INTO THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE INDUSTRY THE HIGHER THE CONCENTRATION. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY ITSELF THE BOTTOM 25% IT IS OVER 85% OF THE WORKFORCE. AT THE VERY LOW END OF THE INCOME LADDER THAT'S THE DAMAGE. IN ONE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT IS VALIANT BUT FEW TILE. YOUR CHANCES OF BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OR ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED YEARS. YOUR CHANCES OF BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE MULTI AGENCY JOINT FORSMAN STRIKE FORCE ARE ONCE EVERY THREE THOUSAND YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BUREAU FIELD ENFORCEMENT REPORTED TWENTY IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF WAGES ILLEGALLY REPORTED OR NOT REPORTED AT ALL. IN A HUNDRED NINETY ONE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. THEY ASESSED ONLY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN PENALTIES IN WAGES AND THEY COLLECTED SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST 80% OF WHAT THEY ASSESSED AGAIN IN A HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WE'RE CHEATING IS OUT OF CONTROL. THAT'S THE ENFORCEMENT. THE JOINT LIABILITY STANDARD AND SEVEN SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN AND SENATOR DHIRAJ ROOMS BILL BEGAN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. IT TOOK DEAD AND MANGLED CHILDREN IN THE TEXTILE FACTORIES TO FINALLY PASSED THAT LAW AND AFTER YEARS OF FOR THE STRUGGLE IT FINALLY WORKED. OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS THE NEW SUBLETT CLASS OF CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NEED THAT STANDARD. HONEST CONTRACTORS NEED THAT STANDARD AND IT ALREADY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION EXCUSE ME. WHEN GOVERNMENT BILLS UNLIKE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE SERVICE THE CONSUMER THE REGULATOR AND ENFORCER. THEY SET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN THE INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT WANTS THE PROP THEIR PROJECTS WELL DESIGNED AND BUILT TO LAST WITH WORKERS THAT MAKE GOOD WAGES AND BENEFITS AND WORK ON SAFE JOB SITES THEY DON'T TELL TOLERATE OR TURN A BLIND EYE A BIT CONTRACTORS THAT'S THE PRESIDENT. THE GENERAL CONTRACT CONTRACT IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A PROJECT. IF IT'S NOT THEN RIGHT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE. IF THE WINDOWS ARE UPSIDE DOWN THEY DON'T SAY SORRY. IT WAS A SUBCONTRACTOR'S FAULT THAT THE ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS THE ABILITY THE TOOLS AND THE AUTHORITY AND NOW WE WOULD SAY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN AND JOINT LIABILITY IS NOT A MAGIC CURE TO THE CANCER OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IT IS A BIG STEP BIDWILL TO STILL TAKE YEARS TO CHANGE THE WILD WEST CULTURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE INDUSTRY. SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN IS NOT A WAGE BILL. IT'S NOT A WAGE BILL. IT'S A PLAY BY THE RULES BILL IT'S A WAGE THEFT BILL CONTRACTORS ARE CORRUPT REQUIRED RIGHT NOW BY LAW TO KEEP PAYROLL RECORDS. THAT TIME SHE RECORDS IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK. NO MORE LOOKING THE OTHER WAY NO MORE FINGER POINTING NO MORE SAYING IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT IT'S TIME FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER AND PLAY BY THE RULES. ONE LAST THOUGHT. YOU ARE FACING A CRISIS WITH A TALL ORDER OF BUILDING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOUSING UNITS. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE INDUSTRY CLAIMS THEY DON'T HAVE THE WORKERS. THEY WON'T HAVE THE WORKERS AS LONG AS YOUNG WORKERS SEE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS A TOUGH DIRTY DANGEROUS JOB THAT WILL LEAVE THEM IN POVERTY. THAT WON'T CHANGE UNTIL YOUNG WORKERS SEE THIS INDUSTRY AS MORE THAN JUST BUILDING STRUCTURES BUT AS A WAY TO BUILD THE FUTURE. IT USED TO BE THAT WAY AND IT SHOULD BE THAT WAY AGAIN. SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN MATTERS AND WILL HELP ARE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND- BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BURTON. WE HAVE A.

THANK YOU MODERATOR HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. FOR SB SEVEN FOR I'M SORRY SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WE DO HAVE TO LEAD OPPOSITIONS ON FILE SILVIA FERRARI FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS SCOTT GOVERNOR. BROWN THE GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATES- DO WE HAD MR SILVA FERRARI ON THE LINE. NOT INSURE LOW CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HELLO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN THE BILL FOR OUR AND AFTER CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION TODAY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE SENATE BILL SEVEN TWO SEVEN I'M MEASURE THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A HOUSING KILLER BY THE CBI GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE ACTUALLY FIND OURSELVES HAVING TO RE OPEN WHAT WAS A FASHION LONG DEBATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN REGARDS TO AB SEVENTEEN OH ONE AND AT THAT TIME THE BILL INITIALLY CONTAIN VERY SIMILAR PROVISIONS TO THOSE IN SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN. NAMELY THE PROVISION SEEKING TO IMPOSE PENALTIES LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ON HOME BUILDERS FOR DIRECT CONTRACTORS IN THOSE PROVISIONS WERE REMOVED FROM SEVENTEEN OH ONE GB I WENT NEUTRAL I DON'T EVEN. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ARE PUNITIVE. VIRGINS ARE APPROACH WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO PUNISH THE WRONGDOER MEMBERS PUNISH THE WRONGDOER BECAUSE AN INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING IS COMMITTED. SO THERE IS FRAUD THERE IS MALICE THERE IS OPPRESSION COMMITTEE IN THE ACT. IS NOT AND CANNOT BE THE CASE WHEN THE PARTY WHO THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO PENALIZE PUNITIVELY HOMEBUILDER THE DIRECT CONTRACTOR DO DOES NOT KNOW DOES NOT CONTROL THE PAYMENT AND BILLING ACTIONS OF THE SUBCONTRACTOR. AND AS YOU HEARD THERE IS NO PUBLIC LIST MADE AVAILABLE BY ANY PUBLIC AGENCY THAT IDENTIFY BAD ACTORS IF THE STATE WERE TO PUBLISH IN THAT LIST. OUR MEMBERS WOULD LOOK TO IT TO HELP INFORM THEIR HIRING DECISIONS BUT SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN IN THIS BILL IS EVEN GOING TO BE REMOTELY WORKABLE AND NOT BANKRUPT BUILDERS ESPECIALLY THOSE SMALL MEDIUM BUILDERS INTO THE FUTURE. YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE A MEANINGFUL TEACHER OPPORTUNITY THAT INSURERS WORKERS ARE PAID WITH THEIR OWN IT INSURERS HOMEBUILDERS AND DIRECT CONTRACTORS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. HERE AND AVOID ANY PENALTIES OR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES BECAUSE AGAIN THEY WERE NOT THE PARTY WHO COMMITTED THE WRONGDOING. AND WHILE WE-APPRECIATE WHAT WE HEARD IN THE ARTICULATION OF THE AMENDMENT. THERE STILL SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT TO DO THERE TO MAKE THIS BILL EVEN REMOTELY WORKABLE. SO IN A MEETING COACH HERE IS NOT INCORPORATED SEVENTY SEVEN IN THIS BILL REALLY IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN UPHOLSTERED VERY WOULD YOU MIND CLOSING ON THOSE. ON THOSE WHO DID NOT COMMIT THE ACT AND THAT IS NOT JUSTICE IN THE NAME OF WORKERS SO WE ARE OPPOSED THIS IS A HOUSING KELLER WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL WE CAN WORK ON AMENDMENTS MOVING FORWARD- BUT WE ASK YOU KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FERRARI- WE HAVE MISTER SCOTT GOVERNOR IS HE. ON THE LINE PERCENT. I DON'T MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES GOVERNOR HOW SINCE EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION. OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY. TO THE- LATE AND- AT LIKE TO THINK THEY'RE NOT THE TARGETS OF THIS BILL YET THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED WE DO COULD DID NEGOTIATE SEVENTEEN OH ONE DIRECTLY WITH. THE PROPONENTS- AND WE DID ADDRESS THE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES THAN. FIFTEEN MUCH REFERENCE TO THE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS THE LABOR CODE PROVISIONS THAT APPLY THERE. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT ONLY TAKES SOME OF THOSE PROVISIONS. WE ACTUALLY REQUESTED- OF THE CARPENTERS AND SUGGESTED TO THE AUTHOR THEY TAKE THE ENTIRE LABOR CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. IN TRANSFER THAT HERETHAT PROVIDES TO PROCESS IT INSURES THAT WORKERS GET PAID QUICKER. UNFORTUNATELY AS PER THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OFFERED TODAY ACCEPTED TODAY. THERE IS NO ACTUAL RIGHT TO CURE. THE CONTRACTOR GETS A NOTICE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF SOMETIME COULD BE A YEAR AFTER THE PROJECTS DONE. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE ACTUAL WORKERS. YOU CAN'T Q. OR WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. LABOR CODE ADDRESSES THIS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE I. R. TO NOTIFY THE CONTRACTOR WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS. OF THE ACTUAL CLAIM WHAT CONTRACTORS THEN DO AS THEY SHUT DOWN THE SUBCONTRACTOR THEY STOP PAYING THEM THEY DEMAND THEY FIX IT OR THEY TERMINATE THEM. WE THINK THAT'S A FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE PROVISION THAN THE RIGHT TO CURE HERE WHICH AGAIN CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED IT WILL GET WORKERS PAY. AND YOU KNOW WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION WITH HER HAVE YOU CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CARPENTERS. BUT AGAIN AS THE MOMENTS- WERE EXCEPT ACCEPTED TODAY THEY DON'T FIX THE PROBLEM SO THESE RESULTS- REQUESTED HELP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW MOVE INTO ROOM TWENTY FORTY WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN SEEN NONE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MODERATOR FOR ACCOMMODATING THE REQUEST WE WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. YES CENTER TO RAZA THREE COMMAND CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- VERY MUCH AND THE CARPENTER'S SON AND EVERYONE WHO'S WORKING ON THIS YOU KNOW JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO- WE HEARD ABOUT GARMENT WORKERS AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY WHERE THEY EXPLODED THROUGH PEACE WORK IT'S THE MODEL OF. THE INDUSTRY. UP WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PORT TRUCKERS BEING MISCLASSIFIED ENTIRE INDUSTRY THAT'S IMPACTED. TODAY WE HEAR ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND THE WAGE THEFT THAT IS STILL GOING ON- AND THEN ALL THREE OF THESE INDUSTRIES THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS. IN NON BETTER INCLUDED IN THAT ARE LATINOS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN THOSE THREE INDUSTRIES ARE LATINOS. I WONDER WHY 80% OF THE CHILDREN IN L. A. U. S. T. QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED MEALS. 80% OF THE KIDS. SO THESE ARE YOU KNOW THOSE SAME KIDS LIVE IN OVERCROWDED HOUSING THOSE SAME KIDS UGH- ARE FACING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. EXTER LEARNING LOSS BEYOND WHAT OTHERS- THESE ARE THESE ARE ISSUES THAT IS NOT JUST ABOUT A FEW WORKERS HERE AND THERE THESE ARE THESE ARE ENTIRE INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE GOT TO DO BETTER AND I'M A REALLY YOU KNOW OF WAS GLAD TO SEE MR GOVERNOR HERE AND OTHERS WHO- ARE HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND SAID THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AND WITH THE CARPENTERS- WE CAN'T GO ON AS A STATE LIKE THIS- WE THEN ARE HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE OUR TAX DOLLARS WE'RE HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE ALL THOSE FAMILIES THROUGH A SAFETY NET OR BY- PAYING FOR THOSE MEALS FOR THOSE CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN THE POVERTY- WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THESE SYSTEMS DRAMATICALLY. SO THAT TAXPAYERS DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING THE BILL ON AND IT JUST IS VERY UPSETTING THAT WE KEEP HAVING TO DEAL WITH THESE INDUSTRIES SO I PLUGGED THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. TAKING THE STEPS THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS OF. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL CENTER NEWMAN AT THANK YOU MEMBERSHIP. SO- RELATED YOU FOR ALL HARD WORK ON THIS HARD BILL. I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS OVER LAST WEEK- WHICH HAS TO BE JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TIME YOU SPENT- AND WE COMMEND YOU AND THE CHEER. FOR MAKING YOURSELVES SO AVAILABLE TO BOTH SIDES AND I AND I'M GONE I'M GONE I'M ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE STILL WORKING. WITH OPPOSITION SO- I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE BROADER COMPLAIN OF THE CIA AND OTHER FOLKS. THAT THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY A SYSTEMIC ABILITY TO TRACK BAD ACTORS- AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THEIR CONCERN ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. YOU KNOW UNDER THE CONTEXT IS CREATED. TO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND RIGHT JUST TO REITERATE BECAUSE LIKE I'M ACTUALLY NOT A BIG FAN OF HOW WE DO THIS DURING THE PANDEMIC I THINK IT LOSES A LOT OF THE TRANSLATION. AND SOME OF THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE COMPLICATED AND QUITE SUBTLE. AND SERVE YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO WHERE THE BILL IS RIGHT NOW- THE AMENDMENT YOU'VE TAKEN SO FAR BUT THEN MOVING FORWARD. I DI DI AM SURE OF YOUR INTENT. TO TRY AND MEET THE NEEDS. OR THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AS YOU MOVE IT FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN AND WELL THIS IS CONVOLUTED AT TIMES. THE BILL IS REALLY PRETTY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WAGE THEFT IS NOT A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK TODAY HELP REMOVE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT AND THER CONCERNS ABOUT. WORKERS COMPENSATION- THE LAST PART OF THE MA'AM WE TOOK WOULD REQUIRE NOTICES TO BE FILED WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. WHICH WOULD TRACK THE WAGE THAT VIOLATION ON THE ORIGINAL EMPLOYERS LICENSE. AND JOINT LIABILITY FOR WAGE VIOLATION PENALTIES COULD APPLY IF THREE NOTICES ARE FILED. WITHIN A THREE YEAR PERIOD BUT AS ARM YOU HEARD ME SAY IN MY OPENING WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS- WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WE CAN FINISH THE CONVERSATION BILLS FOR THAT WAY. AND RIGHT TO CURRENT WORKING ON A RIGHT TO CURE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO. EVERYONE INVOLVED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. WORKING WITH ALL STATE FOR BONDHOLDERS SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION AS WE GO TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH WOULD BE JUDICIARY. I LIKE TO SAY THAT A GOOD NEGOTIATION MEANS EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE BIT HAPPY. AND A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS AND MAKING SURE WORKERS ARE PAID FAIRLY. I PROJECT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT IN MANY CASES. SO YOU KNOW WITH THAT IN MIND SO I I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I DOUBT I WOULD URGE YOU. TO CONTINUE WORKING. WITH THE SUPPORTERS- WITH THEIR SPONSORS WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK- AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU CAN GET TO A- A BIT LEAST. NEUTRAL ON THE OTHER SIDE. TWO FOUR TWO THANK YOU THANK CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE OTHER COMMENTS FROM. THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER LEYVA AT THIS TIME I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING YOUR THE BIL AT THIS TIME BUT I AM EXCITED TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS I BELIEVE THAT- IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS WILL DO MUCH BETTER WHEN WE DO HAVE BALANCE POLICIES.

VERY HELLO WELCOME SENATOR PAN YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BIO ON S. P. FOR TWENTY OR TWENTY TWO. YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- MEMBERS- PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT SB FOUR TWENTY TWO A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES BY EXTENDING WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY THE CIVIL SERVICE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. CURRENT LABOR LAW LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF HOURS A CIVIL SERVICE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL CAN PERFORM BEFORE THE STATE IS REQUIRED TO UTILIZE A CONTRACTOR PROVISIONAL SERVICES AND UNDER THE CURRENT MODEL CONTRACTORS IN COSTA STATE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. THAN COMPARED TO OTHER CIVIL SERVICE PROFESSIONALS PATIENTS ALSO CAN SUFFER DUE TO GAPS IN CARE FROM THEIR TRUSTED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR ITS PATIENTS AT STATE HOSPITALS AND CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS CURRENTLY SUFFERS FROM HIGH VACANCY RATES AMONGST PHYSICIANS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY DATA REVEALS A VACANCY RATE OF 29% AMONG ALL STATE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. THE VACANCY RATE AND FOR OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS EMPLOYING PHYSICIANS CAN RANGE FROM FORTY SEVEN TO EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. SB FOUR TWENTY TWOS MODELED AFTER A SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES FOR THE COUNTY. SB FOUR TWENTY TO SIX DEGREES TO CREATE A POSITION AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL REGISTRY THEY'LL ENCOURAGE SCHEDULING FLEXIBILITY AND GREATER PATIENT COVERAGE FOLLOWING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO REPAY MAIN AT THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. THIS BILL ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR CALLIE CHARGES TABLETS TO REGISTRY BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY IN ADDITION EACH STATE AGENCY EMPLOYING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE REGISTRY MUST CONDUCT REPORT STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST SAVINGS AT THE REGISTRY BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SIX. PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WILL SUNSET ON JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME DR STUART BUSSY PRESIDENT OF THE UNION AMERICAN PHYSICIANS DENTISTS TO TESTIFY ON THIS ISSUE AND TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE SPECIALLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR LEAD AT SUPPORT WITNESS WITH DOCTORS STOURTON. ABBASI THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES SIR. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS DR STEWART BUT SHE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS ASKED ME LOCAL TWO OH SIX. AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWENTY TWO. TO HEAR THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS PROVIDING BETTER CONTINUITY OF HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA'S INMATES. AND HOSPITALIZE MENTALLY ILL. IT WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. CONTRACTING OUT STATE EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE POSITIONS HAS REMAINED A PROBLEM FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I TESTIFIED AND RECOMMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. CAN PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM BUT NONE HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. BUT I AM MORE HOPEFUL NOW. THE STATE AND THE UNION HAVE COLLABORATED IN A RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STUDY OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. THAN IN THIS REPORT STATISTICS SHOW A STEADILY INCREASING AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING SPENT ON PRIVATE HEALTH CARE CONTRACTORS. GET BACK SO THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITION VACANCIES NCDC R. AND D. S. H. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. WHAT CONTRACT MADE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AT ACDC OUR PRISON IN ONE MONTH. THE STATE PAYS CONTRACTORS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR BARGAINING UNIT SIXTEEN WORK AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE WHEN CONTRACTING OUT BARGAINING UNIT NINETEEN PSYCHOLOGISTS. SOCIAL WORKERS PHARMACISTS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST. BUT COLEMAN COURT SPECIAL MASTERS REPORT OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN RECOMMENDED BETTER SALARY OPPORTUNITIES TO RETAIN OUR STATE POSITIONS. ARE YOU A DUTY AS PREVIOUSLY NEGOTIATED ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENT LANGUAGE IN ITS MO YOU WITH THE STATE BUDGET IS DISCRETIONARY ON THE PART OF THE STATE AND THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS LANGUAGE AND HAS BEEN HESITANT TO DO SO. EVENTUALLY NEED FOR SB FOUR TWENTY TWO. A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE OF AN EMPLOYEE REGISTRY WOULD ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM IT'S A BY MORE RELIABLE HEALTHCARE AT A MUCH LOWER COST. STATE EMPLOYEES IN CONTRAST TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ALREADY KNOW THEIR PATIENTS ALREADY KNOW THEIR INSTITUTIONS. THEY WOULD PROVIDE BETTER CONTINUITY OF CARE. THAT 110035% OF THEIR BASE SALARY THAT'S A BARGAIN COMPARED TO THE CONTRACTORS RATE OF 2100% HIS PROPOSED REGISTRY WILL BE MODELED AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGISTRY THOSE REGISTRY PROFESSIONALS THEIR PATIENTS ARE HAPPY. AND THE COUNTY OF SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO AT THE FORT SB FOUR TWENTY TWO REGISTRIES CAN ACCOMPLISH THE SAME RESULTS FOR THE STATE. I REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTES ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MY UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANOTHER READ SUPPORT WITNESS. THERE ARE NONE OKAY WE WILL ASK IF THERE ARE ANY SUPPORT WITH. ON THIS BLL IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM AT THIS TIME IF SO.

HERE KEVIN COLBERT NINETEEN BEFORE THIS COULD SENATOR COMES FORWARD. CENTER PORTANTINO. YOU'RE WELCOME TO PRESENT ON SB FOUR FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- AS THE CHAIR SAID I'M HERE FOR SB FOUR FIFTY SEVEN THAT WILL FURTHER CALIFORNIA'S- DIVEST MAN EFFORTS FROM THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT- MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF. THE CITY OF GLENDALE BOTH IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE CITY ARE DESCENDANTS OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE SURVIVORS. MOST OF THEM RECENTLY I'VE HAD TO RE RE LIVE THE INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA. DURING THE RECENT EVENTS IN THE ARTSAKH WAR IN WHICH TURKEY WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED. THANK OF BEING THE DESCENDANT OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE VICTIM. AND THEN THINK OF THE ATTACKS ON ETHNIC REGION OF THE WORLD WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A COUSIN. OR A SISTER. OR NEPHEW WHO EITHER FOUGHT IN THE WAR OR DIED IN THE WAR. AND NOW THINK OF YOUR HARD EARNED. WAGES AS A CITY EMPLOYEE OR A SCHOOL TEACHER. AND A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR WAGES GOING TO THE COUNTRY WHO PERPETRATED THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND THEN SUPPORTED THE RECENT ATTACK. ON ARTS SHOCK- I DON'T THINK ANY OF US. WOULD FEEL GOOD ABOUT. THAT SITUATION THE THOUGHT OF HAVING YOUR WAGES BEING INVESTED IN THE COUNTRY. THE FRONT DESK TO YOUR FAMILY. AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO FIND A CREATIVE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM BY ALLOWING CITY OF GLENDALE EMPLOYEES OR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES OF THE GLENDALE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. POPPED OUT OF THAT- THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FRANKLY THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IS. RELATIVE TO THE PERSON STIRS OVERALL PORTFOLIO. IT'S NOT GIGANTIC YOU KNOW 70% OF THOSE INVESTMENTS FRANKLY ARE U. S. INVESTMENTS- BUT- JUST THE SHEER THOUGHT THE OUTRAGE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE. COMPATRIOTS WHO ARE BEING HELD AS PRISONERS OF WAR TODAY. AND THERE ARE CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS AND HOMES THAT WERE SEIZED LAST YEAR- I'VE BEEN TO THAT REGION THREE TIMES. I ACTUALLY WENT TO A WEDDING AND A BEAUTIFUL WHITE CATHEDRAL IN THE TOWN OF SHUSHI. WHICH IS NOW BEEN SEIZED BY THE AZERBAIJANIS. AND THE CHURCH HAS BEEN DESTROYED- IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. AND IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR PURCHASERS TO INVEST IN THE GOVERNOR TURKEY FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO DENY THE GENOCIDE. AND THEN SECONDLY FOR THE ATROCITIES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN OUR TALK OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WITH ME TODAY ON THE PHONE WE HAVE- WE THE DIVIDEND FROM THE ARMENIAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF AMERICA WESTERN REGION AND MEET ON THE MARGINS FROM THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY AND I KNOW ONE OF MY WE TOOK ME TO WITNESSES AS COUNCIL MEMBER.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND% SENATORS MY NAME IS SETH BRAMBLE I'M SPEAKING THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL FOUR FIFTY SEVEN OUR MEMBERS WORK WITH SIX MILLION STUDENTS AND ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE FACING TEACHING SHORTAGES THATPREDATE THE PANDEMIC BUT HAVE WORSENED IN MANY DISTRICTS SENTENCE AMERICANS WE'RE SEEING A SURGEON TEACHERS RETIRING EARLIER THAN PLANNED IN MAJOR PART. DUE TO THE CHALLENGES OF TEACHING DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THOMAS OF THE SECURE RETIREMENT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT DRIVES GOOD CANDIDATES INTO THIS PROFESSION. WELL LONG TERM FUNDING PLANS ARE PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS UNFUNDED LIABILITY ANYTHING THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY OF OUR PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS TO ACHIEVE THEIR INVESTMENT TARGET. COMPROMISES THE PLAN THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS PARTICIPATING CAL STIRS AND ASSEMBLY BILLS- FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ESTABLISH THE COASTERS FUNDING PLAN. THIS PLAN PUTS CALLUSES ON THE PATH TO FULL FUNDING BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY FORTY SIX THROUGH INCREMENTAL SHARE CONTRIBUTION INCREASES AMONG THE PROGRAM'S THREE CONTRIBUTORS CUSTER'S MEMBERS EMPLOYERS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BEST MAN CARRIES THE RISK OF ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER TO CHOOSE TO DIVEST. CREATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE COULD SEE DIFFERENT INVESTMENT RETURNS TO BE BLUNT IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A STATEWIDE PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEM. THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY EMPLOYERS AND MEMBERS MUST BE PUT TOGETHER AND INVESTED JOINTLY IN A SINGLE PORTFOLIO WITH INVESTMENT RETURNS BEING CREDITED TO THE SYSTEM RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER ACCOUNTS CAN YOU IMAGINE. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON CASTERS TO ESTABLISH. THIS MANY SEPARATE PORTFOLIOS CASTERS IS WITH US THIS EVENING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT TO BE CLEAR THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ONE ADMINISTRATION ALONE WE OPPOSE SENATE BILL. FOUR FIFTY SEVEN AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK. THANK YOU MISTER. JENNIFER BIG YOU NEXT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

RETIRED TEACHERS ARE INCREASINGLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSETS IN HOLES IN THE MEDICARE COVERAGE LEAVING MANY ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE PARTICULARLY IN TODAY'S ECONOMY WHICH IS BEING COMPOUNDED BUT BABY BOOMER RETIREMENTS. ARE OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE STEMS NOT ONLY FROM THE YACHT DESIGNERS THE OLD TIMIDLY AT YOU GUYS ADMIT FROM TURKEY WITHOUT INDEMNIFICATION TO THE CHARACTER ON. THE COMPLETE ERADICATION OF CHARACTERS WITHIN HIGHER INVESTMENT STRUCTURE SOLELY FOR ONE ISSUE. OUR MEMBERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR RETIREMENT SECURITY AS DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION TO THEIR LONG TERM RETIREMENT SECURITY. THROUGHOUT THE LAST DECADE THE GREAT RECESSION AND INITIAL PANDEMIC ECONOMY HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON THE HEALTH. AND WELL BEING OF RETIREES. HELLO THREE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBER YOU BIG HEAD COACH NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN A WHICH WERE OUT MEMBERS AT. I DID WE HAVE RECENTLY SEEN A 26% INCREASE IN TEACHERS RETIREMENT THIS PAST YEAR WHICH MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL FISCAL LONG TERM STRAIN ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE SECTOR. OUR MEMBERSHIP FAILED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SHOULD BE HELD. ACCOUNTABLE DECISION THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE STATE THEY CERTAINLY DON'T SUPPORT THE ACTIONS OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT BUT WITH THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS VIçT BECOMING EVEN MORE WEALTHY WHY IS IT THAT MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN NOT THAT YOU PERCENT FOR CORPORATE AMERICA ARE SEEN AS THE PRIMARY CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE RETIREMENT SECURITY SHOULD BE PART. IN BED OF ALL TAXPAYERS. PAYING FOR THE COST OF THE MEASURE. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MEASURE COMPLY REDO THE INVESTMENT BRANCH OF. WHICH ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF CHARACTER STAFF TO REACH INVESTMENT GOALS WHICH WOULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON STATE SCHOOL AND TEACHER CONTRIBUTION RATES AND I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL BEEN CARING FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN YOUR AREA. REGARDING CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED OFF PROBABLY INTENTIONS. TO REVIEW. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIT RAPPA PLEASE. I'M SORRY WE HAVE A TEN MINUTE WAIT STRAIGHT.

THANK YOU- AS AS A COURTESY- UNDERSTANDING THAT TO SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH THE- HI THE SUPPORT WITNESS AND- WE WERE INSTRUCTED AT A TIME THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION FOR THE SPORT WITNESS. BUT SENATOR YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTION HOPEFULLY THE MODERATOR CAN FACILITATE A RESPONSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU'VE BEEN VERY GRACIOUS AND I REALLY APPRECIATED TO COUNCILMEMBER KASATKINA IS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED THIS LEGISLATION TO ME AS A- PERSON IN THE PER SYSTEM AND ALSO DISSENTED OF. ARMENIAN GENOCIDE SURVIVORS I JUST WANTED TO ASK HIM. IF HE WOULD APPROXIMATE ABOUT HOW MANY CITY AND SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES. ARE OF ARMENIAN HERITAGE TO PAY INTO THE SYSTEM. AND IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION JUST TO PUT A PERSPECTIVE ON IT. IF IS THERE. THE WOULD BE BELOW ABOVE THREE FREE SPONSORED ON VERY BRIEF PLEASE IF YOU'RE STILL AVAILABLE SIR IT IS A- AND IF HE'S NOT THERE I'LL JUST GO TO MY CLOTHES WHEN APPROPRIATE OKAY THANK YOU. WE'VE BEENVERY GRACIOUS WE CAN MOVE O THE ROAD ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO AND MOVE ON- WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE. IN LINE WITH OUR- RULES OF ENGAGEMENT HERE IN TERMS OF SPEAKERS AND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME CENTER ALERT IS SB KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU- I THINK THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL AND ONE BILL IS THE PART THAT HAS TO DO WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. WHERE THE CASE HAS BEEN VERY COMPELLINGLY MADE. THE SECOND PART IS HOW IF THERE IS. AN ECONOMIC ISSUE HOW IT'S DRIVEN HOME I THINK THAT PART IS FLAWED. I THINK IT NEEDS WORK AND I DON'T WANT THE- THE NOTION THAT THAT MIGHT BE FLAWED TO STOP THE BILL AND HAVE ANYBODY INTERPRETED IT. AS OUR STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND SO WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS. IS THAT WE MOVE THIS BONE BUT WE LET THE AUTHOR KNOW HE'S GOT SOME WORK TO DO ON THE SIDE THAT'S THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO FIX. AND THEN I WOULD HOPE. IF WE SEE THIS ON THE FLOOR WHO OVER ANOTHER TIME THAT THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BUT- THE AUTHOR HAS MADE A COMPELLING CASE AND I WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO. TO ALIGN THE IMPACT OF THE BILL WITH THE GRAVITY OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS SO DO PROPER TIME I'LL BE WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL AND THAT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING. WITH REGARD TO IT BEING ABLE. THE HE'LL BE JUST THAT I. SHE THAT ALMOST FEEL LIKE YOU. WE SHARED A SPEECH OF FOR TODAY'S- DISCUSSION NONPARTISAN WHICH OF COURSE WE BOTH KNOW WE DID NOT- IT OUT I'D ACTUALLY EVEN GO A LITTLE BIT JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND IT JUST SAY- THAT I ACTUALLY THINK. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THESE FIVE SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR A ROBUST DEBATE ON ON BOTH SIDES THERE'S IS A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO SEE THIS. OUT OF IT INTO THE LARGER FORUM BOTH OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SIDE- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT OPPORTUNITY IS. AVAILABLE THUS FAR BUT BUT ALSO IN THIS ISSUE ON THIS ISSUE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND AT WHAT POINT DOES HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION RISE TO THE LEVEL OF MORE WE ACTUALLY. TAKE THIS KIND OF A OF AN ACTION- I AM NOT SOLD ON THAT YET BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE IMPLICATIONS AND- I DID HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHOR AHEAD OF TIME AND INDICATED THAT. RELEASED I'D PROBABLY USE THAT WORD ONCE OR TWICE TODAY BUT AS A COURTESY- TO THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO MAY WHO MAY WISH TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE TO THE TO THE AUTHOR- WHO. I IS ALL. ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING GOOD IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. OF BUT TO. ADVANCE THE BILL AS CENTER ALERT SAID. REALLY AREN'T TOO TO ALLOW THE DEBATE THE BROADER DEBATE THE CURSED BE ON THIS COMMITTEE ROOM- BUT IT BUT I MUST SAY YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE HELP. THE MORE GRANULAR ISSUES LIKE HOW DO YOU INDEMNIFY- THE COASTERS YOU KNOW BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF. THE HARD WORK THEY WERE DOING TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES AROUND UNFUNDED. PENSIONS AND SO FORTH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU TAKE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTION AT THE SAME TIME- NOT YOU KNOW UNDER CUT THE GOOD WORK THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. A DESPITE THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE SO I THINK THOSE ISSUES REALLY NEED- THE NEW THROUGH DEBATE WHICH IS REASON TO GET THEM OUT- BUT THEY ALSO PREFER THIS VOTE ON. ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS YOU KNOW RAISE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS- AND CERTAINLY CENTER PORTANTINO WHEN WE'RE DONE UP HERE- IF YOU WANT INCLUDES ANYTHING ABOUT- THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT. THE UNDERCUTTING OF THE SYSTEM OF FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT I THINK OF ALL THIS WOULD BE OPEN TO HEARING THAT ALTHOUGH YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO THAT IS YOU KNOW- SENATORS ANYONE ELSE WISH TO COMMENT CENTER NEWMAN. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SURE SO. THAT NONE I WANT TO SAY. AND VERY RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT I HAVE. GREAT SYMPATHY FOR THE GOALS OF THE BILL SENATE- I AM EQUALLY SYMPATHETIC TO BE. THE COMPLAINT. OF THE RETIREES THAT IT IS THEY WHO WOULD BE ABSORBING THE BURDEN- AND NOT THE STATE- AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES MOVING FORWARD- THAT SHOULD RIGHTFULLY BE BASED ON IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THIS. AND THEN THAT DIFFERENT QUESTION HOW WE DIVEST. OF SOME OF THESE ASSETS WHILE HOLDING HARMLESS THE BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE RETIREMENT MONIES- AND SO ON FORCING WHILE I DO AGAINST SYMPATHIZED WITH YOUR GOALS HERE AND CERTAINLY WITH. THE SENTIMENTS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I WILL UNFORTUNATELY VOTING NO TODAY. SUBMITTER SAID RUSSELL YES- THE LITTLE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY WHICH IS THE HISTORIC HOME OF ARMENIANS IN THE STATE AND PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY IS IN MY DISTRICT- THOSE MEN WOMEN FAMILIES HAVE SHARED WITH ME FOR YEARS WHAT IT IS THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH IT IS THAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH SO I FEEL- THEIR STORY HAS GOT IS STARTING TO GET OUT. IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I COMMEND THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY FOR FIGHTING BACK OF WITH WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE. IN THEIR COMMUNITY WITH THE- IN AT WITH THE GENOCIDE SO I SUPPORT AS BEFORE FIFTY SEVEN. I UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL ISSUES OF FACING- THE RETIREMENT FUND I WAS A TRUSTEE ON A RETIREMENT FUND FOR MANY YEARS- AND WE HAD TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR STATE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT% IT- WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON I AGREE WITH SENATOR LAYERED AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE YOU KNOW. YES OR NO THIS IS THIS HAS SOME REAL IMPLICATIONS WHICH IS PARTLY THE REASON THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US BECAUSE IT HAS IT SHOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR TURKEY FOR WHAT THEY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE AND WHAT THEY FAILED TO DO SO- IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION. I THINK THERE'S A WAY OF MOVING FORWARD TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS TO TURKEY- AND- AND NOT HURT THE RETIREES NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT BY TAKING. ONE OPTION OUT. OF PICTURE DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE WHOLE RETIREMENT FUND IS GOING TO GO DOWN THE TUBES- WE'LL HAVE TO THE- RETIREMENT BOARD WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW TO WORK THAT OUT BUT- IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOSE THEIR OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND AGAIN MAYBE I'M MAKING THIS TOO SIMPLE I'M SURE PEOPLE WOULD SAY. BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- THAT. AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE WHO OPPOSE THIS ARE THINKING THIS IS DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE WE DO THIS ON THIS ISSUE OF THE GENOCIDE OF ARMENIAN PEOPLE MAYBE WILL START PICKING UP OTHER ISSUES I UNDERSTAND THAT COULD POSSIBLY COME UP. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BOMB. NOT TAKE A STEP FORWARD- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE OF OTHER UP BECAUSE OF LEGITIMATE LEGITIMATE OTHER CONCERNS I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE RETIREES ARE COMING FROM I DON'T WANT. ANYONE TO MESS WITH MY RETIREMENT THAT'S FOR SURE BUT- THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS. NOT ONLY INCLUDE THE INTEREST OF THE RETIREES BUT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THE SENATOR WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT YOUR- I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO AFINITOR LEYRITZ COMMENTS- BECAUSE HERS I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I YOU PERFECTLY IN VERY ELOQUENTLY- PLEADED DIFFERENCES CEDED TO CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE HERE- AND IT IS I DO HAVE- I WOULD. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CENTER PORTANTINO TO ADDRESS A POSSIBLE THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM THE OPPOSITION WITH REGARDS TO THE- I GUESS WOULD BE THE LOGISTICAL. ISSUES OF THE BILL BECAUSE IN MERIT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT. YOUR POSITION YEAH. I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS THE LOGISTICAL PART- I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT ALLOWS FOR- I APPRECIATE THE FACT IT DOES ALLOW FOR THAT. THE EMPLOYERS TO CHOOSE AN INVESTMENT OPTION I I'M ALWAYS ABOUT HAVING OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR CONSUMERS AND PEOPLE ARE ON THAT ENDEAVOR BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE COST BEHIND THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AT THIS TIME ABSOLUTELY MISTER CHAIR BACK ADDRESS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS DURING MY CLOTHES THAT PROBABLY IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IF YOU WANT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO ADDRESS I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S A GOOD. ORDER GIVEN THAT EVERYONE IN THE DANCE IS NOW SPOKEN AND- FIVE. YOU COULD JUST FOLD INTO YOUR CLOTHES RESPONSES TO- OUR BY CHAIR A RIDE SHARES OVER A QUESTION THERE- THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THEN LET ME I DON'T WANT TO. TAKE YOU OFF BEFORE IF YOU'RE NOT READY FOR HIM TO GO TO HIS CLOTHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY A CONCERN OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE TOURIST OKAY SO A USER BY SEARS. SEATING FOR NOW AND- WE COME BACK TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES AN ASSET YOU. PUT THE EXTENT POSSIBLE RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS YOUR COM. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN THE NOW- NUMBER FOUR. UNDER EXISTING LAW. IT POINTS OUT THAT- CALPERS AND CAL STIRS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS FOR A RUN. PURSUE DONE AND FOR BUSINESSES DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ISRAEL RELATED TO THE ARAB BOYCOTT. AND ALSO FOR THERMAL COAL COMPANY SO THIS IS NOT PRECEDENT SETTING. THE ACCOUNTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE. SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WHEN THE ARMENIAN STUDENT ASSOCIATION WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND SAID WE'D LIKE YOU TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS. DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAID YES. AND DID IT SO. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE UC I WAS ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE BOTH OF THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT ONE TWO THREE FOUR TIMES ALREADY. SO TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE- ACCOUNTING CAPABILITY TO DO IT. FRANKLY I FIND THAT. TO BE A SUSPECT ARGUMENT I UNDERSTAND IT'S SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO DO- BUT THEY'VE DONE IT IN THE PAST AND- TWO YEARS AGO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I INSTITUTED A POLICY TO DO IT PROSPECTIVELY AS WELL NUMBER TWO. THE AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES. THIS THE SUPPOSITION THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO FALL. IF THEY DO THIS I THINK IT IS NOT NECESSARILY AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF THEIR PROWESS IN MANAGING THE RETIREE'S PORTFOLIO AND THE PERCENTAGE OF THAT PORTFOLIO THAT'S INVESTED IN TURKEY RELATIVE TO THE REST OF IT AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING 70% OF THEIR INVESTMENTS ARE U. S. SO WE ALREADY START OUT WITH A SEVENTY PERCENT. POOL SO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO IS NOT SIGNIFICANT WHERE THIS DIVESTMENT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE RETIREMENT OF ANY OF THESE EMPLOYEES NOR DO I THINK THE 30% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ARE 30% OF THE CITY EMPLOYEES IN GLENDALE. WOULD WANT THEIR RETIREMENT TO BE SUSPECT SO I JUST THINK THAT- POSTULATE IS HERE TO ALARM YOU TO DRY YOUR OPPOSITION TRADITIONALLY DIVEST MEANT BILLS GET OPPOSED BY ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING THIS ONE. I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT BUT I ALSO BELIEVE AS BEEN ARTICULATED BY ALL OF YOU THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE ASPECT OF IT WE ARE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE IN A CERTAIN SET OF VALUES. WE BELIEVE IN HUMAN RIGHTS- WE BELIEVE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND WE OPPOSE HUMAN RIGHTS INJUSTICES AND INDIGNITIES THAT'S WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND TO TRY TO PUT A PRICE ON THAT. AND TO TRY TO ALARM YOU INTO THINKING THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS GREATER THAN IT IS AND THE ACCOUNTING PROBLEM IS A GREATER ACCOUNTING PROBLEM THEN REALITY WHEN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH PRECEDENT THAT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS GOAL WITH OTHER COUNTRIES- I JUST THINK THAT'S MORE OF A TACTIC. THAN A- TRUE ACCOUNTING PROBLEM THAT CAN'T BE SOLVED THEIR IMPLEMENTED I WILL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS TO HEART. I AM CAUGHT HAVING ALMOST WEEKLY CONVERSATIONS WITH PERSON STARES I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT BUT I AM EXTREMELY PASSIONATE. ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY AND WE CAN DO IT FOR A RON AND TO DON AN ON CALL COMPANIES WE CAN RESPECT THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARMENIAN AMERICANS. WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND KNOW THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING THEIR ANCESTORS WILL NOT OWN U TO THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING THEIR ANCESTORS HAVE INVADED A PART OF THEIR COUNTRY HAVE KILLED PEOPLE THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY BROKEN BREAD WITH. AND OF DESECRATED THE CHURCH THAT I WENT TO A WEDDING AT. AND PROUD OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OF GENOCIDE AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY AND I WILL LAST WORD AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES. PROGRESSES THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND I WILL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND SENATOR WILL IS MY JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS AS WELL AS ANOTHER NUMBER OF OTHER AUTHORS.

THESE RETIREES ARE ALSO KNOWN AS A RETIRED ANNUITANT AND THEY ARE LIMITED TO NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS OF WORK PER YEAR THIS BILL WOULD NOT CHANGE THAT. SOME RETIREES DO THIS TO SUPPLEMENT THE RETIREMENT INCOME ALL OTHERS BILLION ESSENTIAL BECAUSE HE'S DURING AN EMERGENCY TO ENSURE ADEQUATE STAFFING OR ME TEMPORARILY STAFF BEACON POSITIONS WHEN NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THESE RETIREES ARE HAVING TO PAY SIGNIFICANT COSTS.

THANK YOU AND THIRTY PER TIME OF COURSE WILL BE ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTES HE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THEM OUR LEAD WITNESS SWITCHES MISTER DAVIS APPEARING HERE'S HERE IN PERSON. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS DAVE SPIRAL I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. CSE IS THE SPONSOR OF SB FOUR ELEVEN BECAUSE THE BILL REPRESENTS A MOVE TOWARD FAIRNESS FOR RETIREES. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM KNOWN AS CALPERS. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT NOTICE PREPARA ALLOWS RETIREES TO WORK FOR A PUBLIC EMPLOYER AFTER RETIREMENT AS LONG AS THEY WAIT AT LEAST A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER RETURNING TO WORK- BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK. AND WORK NO MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOURS PER FISCAL YEAR. IT RETIREES EXCEED THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY HOUR LIMIT UNDER CURRENT LAW. CALPERS IS TECHNICALLY FORCED TO REINSTATE THEM AS ACTIVE MEMBERS. THE PERSON WHO IS DEDICATED YEARS IN THE CASE OF CSEA MEMBERS TO STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. IS THEN REQUIRED TO PAY BACK ALL THEIR EARNED RETIREE BENEFITS THEY RECEIVED AFTER EXCEEDING THE HOUR LIMIT BY EVEN JUST ONE HOUR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE RULES THAT RETIREES MUST FOLLOW. BUT THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED PUNISHMENT HERE OFTEN DOES NOT FIT THE CRIME. CSEA RETIREES HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PAY BACK SIX FIGURES OF THEIR HARD EARNED RETIREE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE MISINFORMED OR MISLED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS. PEOPLE LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME WHO COUNT ON THE PENSION THEY'VE EARNED HAVE FACED MORTGAGING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS WHO OFTEN BACK OUR RETIREES TO COME BACK TO FILL A CRITICAL NEED. THEN FAILED TO PROMPTLY REPORT THEIR HOURS TO CALPERS AND NOTIFY THE RETIREE THAT THEY CROSSED THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY OUR THRESHOLD. SB FOUR ELEVEN WOULD GIVE CALPERS THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER THESE SORTS OF MITIGATING FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER RETIREE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE REINSTATED THAT HAVE TO PAY BACK THE EARNED BENEFITS OVER. IF THERE IS A MORE REASONABLE SOLUTION FOR RETIREE WHO HAS EXCEEDED THE CAP CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH CASE. TO GIVE CALPERS THAT LIMITED DISCRETION. TO CONSIDER THE NEW WANTS AND FAIRNESS IN EACH CASE. CSEA RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE HONEST BEFORE ELEVEN AM THANKS GERMAN CORTESE FOR AUTHORING THE BILL.
