WE DESPERATELY PUBLIC DOLLARS TO

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.139
HELP BUILD MAINTAIN AND RESTORE

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.407
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT MY

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.741
DISTRICT AND ALL THEY PREDICT

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.176
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. WITH

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.478
THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:38.613
WORKING WITH YOU BUT I CAN'T

SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SO IN

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.019
THE BILL- AS WAS MENTIONED TO

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:46.120
YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.156
HAVE ALSO CARVED OUT 10% FOR LOW

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:49.157
INCOME SPECIFICALLY IRRESPECTIVE

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.625
OF CALABAR WAS GOING. WHICH

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.427
MEANS IT'S AN AREA THAT HAS THE

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.895
LOWEST PER CAPITA IN THE ENTIRE

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.963
STATE WOULD. MOST ASSUREDLY

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.532
QUALIFY WE ALSO MAJORED REPLACE

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:58.399
THIS IN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.834
COUNCIL THAT THERE ARE TECHNICAL

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.335
ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES TO HELP.

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:02.570
BRING COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:03.905
KNOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ALSO

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.606
STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THE STATE

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.842
RESOURCES. AND SO WE MOVED AWAY

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.544
FROM THE VIRUS GOING FOR

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.079
PORTION. OF THIS ALLOCATION 10%

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.246
TO MAKE SURE THAT JUST POOR

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.614
COMMUNITIES OUT RIGHT. AREN'T

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.917
LEFT OUT JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.185
HAVE POOR AIR QUALITY OR DON'T

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.486
HAVE POOR WATER QUALITY OF

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.454
WHATEVER METRICS

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.355
DISPROPORTIONATELY WAY.

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:25.593
CALAVERAS GOING. APPRECIATE THAT

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:27.628
OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.263
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.298
WOULD ARGUE THAT LOW INCOME

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:32.033
COMMUNITIES ARE DISADVANTAGED

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:35.169
AND LIKE I SAID IN MY DISTRICT-

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.637
CALAVERAS GREEN REALLY

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:38.573
DISADVANTAGES US LIKE SO I

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.841
THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.375
HAVE SET UP THE PHONE AND

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:42.443
RESPECTFULLY LOW INCOME IS ALSO

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:43.878
ONE OF THE METRICS THAT INCLUDED

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:44.912
IN CALAVERAS SCREEN IT'S

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:47.081
ACCUMULATIVE SCORE. YEAH AND THE

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:48.449
PROBLEM IS IF WE HAVE GOOD AIR

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:49.851
QUALITY AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:52.186
THAT MEANS WE DON'T GET

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.755
ANYTHING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.456
THAT'S A PROBLEM ON ON PRETTY

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.359
MUCH. EVERY EVERY EVERY FACET OF

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:00.294
THAT. AND I SO APPRECIATE WHAT

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.596
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I ABSOLUTELY

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.865
DO AND I DON'T DISPUTE THAT AT

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:06.300
ALL BUT- JUST GET OVER SOMETHING

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:07.502
THE DISADVANTAGES. ARE READY TO

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.437
SERVE AS COMMUNITY. ABSOLUTELY

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:10.838
NOT BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.206
FIND ADDITIONAL METRICS BESIDES

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.842
LOW INCOME- IF THEM AS A BETTER.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.611
TOOL THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND-

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.679
BUT THE ENVIRO GREEN AND THE

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:19.914
COMBINATION OF LOW INCOME I

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.048
THINK IT'S- THE OVERWHELMINGLY

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:22.183
MAJORITY OF DISPROPORTIONATE

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.584
COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.486
STATE. RULE AND URBAN- BUT I'D

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.655
LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:28.923
YOU OF COURSE. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.025
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:37.064
OR COMMENTS OF MISPERCEIVED-

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.033
THANK YOU SO I WANT TO POINT OUT

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.768
THAT THIS SETS ASIDE A

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:41.869
PERCENTAGE AND THERE'S STILL A

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.771
LARGE PART PART OF THE PIE THE

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:45.473
MAJORITY OF IT THAT GO ANYWHERE

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.508
ACROSS THE STATE BUT OUT THERE

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.377
ANYTHING SOMETIMES HERE IN THE

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:51.245
CAPITAL WE GET INTO WHAT I CALL

01:30:51.312 --> 01:30:53.014
THE OPPRESSION OLYMPICS OF WHO

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.049
HAS IT WORSE WE- A LOT OF

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.818
COMMUNITIES NEED TO AT HAND UP

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.619
AND A LOT OF COMMUNITIES UP AND

01:30:58.686 --> 01:30:59.987
DOWN THE STATE HAVE BEEN LEFT.

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.122
OUT OUT THERE. BUT THE REALITY

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.924
IS THAT THERE'S A LARGE

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.091
PROPORTION OF. COMMUNITIES OF

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.527
COLOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:07.595
THAT ARE CONCENTRATED WHERE WE

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:10.364
HAVE. AIR WATER SOIL ISSUES OUT

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:11.799
THERE AND IT'S AT THAT MUCH MORE

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:14.035
MAGNIFIED OUT THERE. AND SO I

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.703
KNOW AT TIMES THE FRUSTRATION

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.638
WITH THE CALAVERAS UNIBODY DO

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.440
THINK IT'S A FAIR TOOL. OUT

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.309
THERE I THINK WHEN YOU START TO

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:23.144
POINT OUT 10% FOR LOW INCOME

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.313
YOU'RE TRYING TO. BE INCLUSIVE

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:26.047
OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:28.583
ALSO BEING LEFT BEHIND FOR OTHER

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:31.285
REASONS- THAT MIGHT NOT INCLUDE

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.420
ERR. OUR WATER BUT OTHER REASONS

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:34.222
THAT ARE ALSO IMPORTANT SO I DO

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:36.524
APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:40.127

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:41.662
LET'S FIGURE OUT THAT THAT PIECE

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.898
BUT THEN AT THE END THE DAY I'D

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:45.433
LIKE TO SEE MUCH MORE THAN THIS

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:47.201
PART OF THE PIE GOING TO

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:47.735
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:49.036
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DEFINE THAT.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:49.837
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THEY

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:52.039
ARE BEARING. THE MAJORITY A LOT

01:31:52.106 --> 01:31:53.608
OF IT OF THE BURDEN OUT THERE

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.577

MOVE AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO

CHANGE THE PERCENTAGE I TO

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.586
HIGHER BUT I DO THINK THAT'S

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.921
SOMETHING THAT WAY I NEED TO

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:09.423

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:05.518
OTHER IMPACTS THAT THAT ARE

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:06.219
GOING ON FROM A WIDER

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:09.422
PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO WHAT THE

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:10.156
ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS WITH

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:13.359
THESE POCKET. POCKET FORESTS. BE

01:52:13.426 --> 01:52:15.995
SUBJECTED TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:18.665
BECAUSE I CAN SEE A LOT OF

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:19.566
BENEFIT IF THERE'S ENOUGH OF

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:22.635
THEM- THAT WE CAN KEEP ALIVE. TO

01:52:22.702 --> 01:52:23.636
AIR QUALITY AND THINGS LIKE

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:26.239
THAT- AND NOT TO MENTION SOME OF

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:28.108
THE THINGS IS SPEAKERS OF SET-

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:31.077
BUT- TO GET THROUGH A PROCESS

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.880
THAT WILL EVALUATE THE WATER AND

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.949
DRAINAGE AND RUNOFF AND THINGS

01:52:36.015 --> 01:52:39.119
LIKE THAT- SEEMS. LIKE IT FLIES

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:40.854
IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE HAVE IN

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:48.561
CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE ALLOW IN

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:50.196
COMES TO THE ISSUE OF DROUGHT

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:51.431
WHICH I THINK IS A REASONABLE

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:53.133
ONE TO CONSIDER- A POCKET FOR

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:54.934
THE THERE ARE OR THEY SHOULD

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:56.836
WATER IN GENERAL AND DROUGHT

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:59.339
MORE SPECIFICALLY- WHAT WHEN IT

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:01.374
COMES TO THIS KIND OF GREENERY

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:02.509
THAT ACTUALLY IS MORE

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:03.810
SUSCEPTIBLE SO IT WAS MORE

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:05.211
SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE POCKET FOR

01:53:05.278 --> 01:53:06.880
HIS UTILIZED NATIVE SPECIES ARE

01:53:06.946 --> 01:53:08.314
MORE COULD TO HANDLE CHALLENGES

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:09.349
AND BY MITCHELL PAN INCLUDING

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:11.484
DROUGHT EACH POCKET FORCES GROWS

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:12.919
INTO MINIATURE SELF SUSTAINING

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:14.220
ECOSYSTEM THAT PROTECT SELF

01:53:14.287 --> 01:53:16.689
CONTROL. THE BILL INSTRUCTS CAL

01:53:16.756 --> 01:53:18.057
PART EMPHASIZE USE THE DROUGHT

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:18.892
RESISTANT NATIVE SPECIES AND

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:20.593
APPROVE POCKET FOR US PROJECTS

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:21.761
AND THE BILL GRANTS RECIPIENTS

01:53:21.828 --> 01:53:23.830
HAVE A LOT OF FUN PROJECT WITH

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:24.330
MEANINGFUL PARTNERS FOR

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.698
IMPLEMENTATION FOR AND A PLAN

01:53:25.765 --> 01:53:27.100
FOR LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF A

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.701
POCKET FOURS AND THAT IT DOES

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:29.769
ALSO INCLUDE CONTINGENCIES FOR

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:31.304
SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:33.039
FINALLY I'D SAY THAT LOOK

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:34.274
ESPECIALLY PUTTING IT OVER

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.408
PAVEMENT OR SOMETHING OR JUST

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:37.944
AND- THAT'S RUNNING OFF INTO THE

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.445
INTO THE WATER STREAM AND

01:53:39.512 --> 01:53:41.114
EVENTUALLY JUST WASTING AWAY

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.749
THIS ACTUALLY ABSORBS WATER IF

01:53:42.815 --> 01:53:44.484
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. A HABITAT OF

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:45.985
THIS NATURE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:53:46.052 --> 01:53:46.886
KEEPING THE WATER IN THE

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:48.221
ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:49.889
GROWING OUR WATER TABLE SO AT

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:52.225
THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ACTUALLY

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.693
A GREAT SPONSOR SO TO SPEAK FOR

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.962
THE WATER THAT FALLS IN THE

01:53:56.029 --> 01:53:56.563
ULTIMATELY OTHERWISE WOULD BE

01:53:56.629 --> 01:54:02.635
GOING TO STRAIGHT OUT. INTO THE

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:05.438
SOLAR SYSTEM. MR FOR. THANK YOU

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:08.007
CHAIR THANK YOU FOR SORT OF- BUT

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.209
- COMMENTS TO BE SOMEONE CLOSE

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:10.310
TO KILL. HERE AT. BUT IS

01:54:10.376 --> 01:54:12.378
INTEREST AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.379
RURAL COMMUNITY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:15.348
I GREW UP IN A RURAL COMMUNITY.

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.749
AND WE'VE GOT GUYS THAT ARE

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:18.518
FOLLOWING LAND- BECAUSE THEY

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:19.552
DON'T HAVE WATER WE'RE JUST

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.653
GONNA DOWN THERE WE'RE NOT

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.754
PLANTING TREES AGAIN. AND THESE

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:23.623
ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHERE. MY

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:25.558
FOLKS GROW UP THIS IS THEIR

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:30.163
PARK. RIGHT AND SO I THINK AS WE

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:30.797
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. WORDS

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:32.332
LIKE AROUND HERE TO PAY PAUL

01:54:32.398 --> 01:54:33.900
WITH THIS AND I THINK A LOT OF

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:36.169
THIS GOES AWAY IF WE ACTUALLY

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:36.936
HAVE. A STORAGE STRUGGLE WITH

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.171
THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE- NONE OF

01:54:38.238 --> 01:54:39.939
US ARE SAYING THAT. KID IN

01:54:40.006 --> 01:54:41.941
BERKELEY SHOULDN'T. HAVE TREASON

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:43.543
AND PLAY ON GRASS LIKE I THINK

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:44.644
THAT'S SAD THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.713
THE CASE. BUT I DO WANNA MAKE IT

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:48.948
VERY VERY CLEAR THAT AS WE

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.250
TRANSFER WATER. INTO OTHER

01:54:50.316 --> 01:54:52.051
REGIONS THAT COME FROM OUR AREA.

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.353
ARE STEALING FROM THE ARSON AS

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:55.021
WELL. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:57.156
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO

01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:57.957
GO AROUND. THE WE DO HAVE THE

01:54:58.024 --> 01:55:00.026
ABILITY TO FIX IT SO I WOULD

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:02.228
ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO HAVE THAT

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:03.229
CONVERSATION AND FOCUS ON THAT.

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:04.964
THEN THE OTHER THING IS- THIS IS

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.600
A SECOND ON A ROAD WE'VE RECALL

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:08.768
PUT TUNING REQUIREMENTS ON

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:09.736
CALIFORNIA. AND I'M CONCERNED

01:55:09.802 --> 01:55:11.337
ABOUT THAT AS WELL. CALIFORNIE

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:12.839
EXISTE UNIQUELY FOCUSED ON

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:13.906
SUPPRESSION AND DO WITH THEIR

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:16.109
SUPER GOOD AT. AND SO I WOULD

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.110
JUST BECOME. A LITTLE BIT

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:18.611
CAUTIOUS ON. THE ADDITIONAL TASK

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.580
WE GIVE THE CAL FIRE. BECAUSE

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:21.981
WHEN THE STATE. ULTIMATELY IS

01:55:22.048 --> 01:55:23.750
BURNING AGAIN WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:24.951
THEM TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT. I

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:27.153
PROJECT THAT I COULD MADAM CHAIR

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:27.820
OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY OPERATES A

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.088
GRANT PROGRAM FOR URBAN GREENING

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:30.990
THIS DISTANCE ADDS THIS IS ONE

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.258
MORE ELEMENT THAT THEY COULD

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.359
POTENTIALLY. COULD COULD QUALIFY

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:34.560
FOR THOSE WHO EXISTING GRANTS.

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:37.330
AND SECONDLY AGAIN- IT I DON'T

01:55:37.397 --> 01:55:39.599
THINK IT HAS TO BE I THINK YOUR

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.434
POINT IS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:42.669
AN EITHER OR NOT AGREE WHEN IT

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.170
COMES TO. A WATER- BUT THE

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:46.005
REALITY IS IN MANY URBAN AREAS

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:47.840
WE LOSE A LOT OF WATER TO RUN

01:55:47.907 --> 01:55:49.042
OFF FAR TOO MUCH. THAT

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:49.909
EVENTUALLY IMPACTS THE ENTIRE

01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:50.910
STATE. BECAUSE THAT URBAN AREAS

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:53.112
ARE TAKING MORE WATER THAN THEY

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:53.780
NEED. THIS ACTION PROVIDES AN

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:55.381
OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO MAINTAIN

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:56.883
MORE WATER IN THE URBAN AREAS OF

01:55:56.949 --> 01:55:58.818
THAT. WOULD HAPPEN TO US OF THE

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:00.086
NEED FOR THE LONG RUN IT WOULD

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:01.821
TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS TO

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:02.755
CREATE A SUSTAINABLE

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:04.524
ENVIRONMENT. BUT ONCE YOU GET

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:05.058
PAST THAT IS A COMPLETELY

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:06.559
SUSTAINABLE. THE STARSHIPS. I

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:08.094
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR.

01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:12.699
WORKING ON THIS. BILL LIKE L.

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.600
AND I WAS IN A PLANT THINKING

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:15.968
THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY RUNS AND

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:18.771
URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM- WORK

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:19.972
WITH THEM REGULARLY IN MY

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:21.974
DISTRICT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:22.809
OFTENTIMES WE CANNOT ACCESS THE

01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:24.610
DOLLARS IS ALL WE HAVE LEFT OUR

01:56:24.677 --> 01:56:26.846
POCKET PARK AREAS AND PARK AND

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:28.881
FORESTRY AREAS AND HAVING TO BE

01:56:28.948 --> 01:56:29.482
CREATIVE. IN THINKING OUTSIDE

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:32.518
THE BOX OUT THERE NOT JUST FOR

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.220
THE BENEFIT OF HAVING NATURE

01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:35.621
AROUND US BUT WE KNOW THAT

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.290
LIVING AMONGST THE CONCRETE THAT

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:38.825
I LIVE IN AND DEFINES MY

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:41.994
DISTRICT WITH SIX FREEWAYS. TO

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.930
REVERSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY JUST A

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:45.298
BUNCH OF CONCRETE THAT BOOK AND

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:47.500
MY DISTRICT AS WELL- OUR

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:49.769
CONCRETE IS THE REALITY IS THAT

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:52.872
I LIVE UNDER HIVING ISAAC THIS

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.674
ALSO HELPS US WITH CLIMATE

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.542
CHANGE WITH A FEW ALLEN AFFECT

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:57.276
THAT OUR CHURCH CONSTANTLY

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:59.245
WORKING ON. AS WELL AND SO I

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:00.747
DON'T THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR I

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:02.048
THINK BEING ABLE TO CREATE

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:04.217
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:05.518
APPROPRIATE AND GETS US TO ARTS

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.186
SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM GOALS

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:09.489
IS WHAT THIS BILL IT IS REALLY

01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:12.024
ABOUT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:12.658
FOR THE INNOVATION OF CALLING

01:57:12.725 --> 01:57:14.560
ATTENTION TO POCKET FOREST

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:20.533
INITIATIVES- AND. I'M NOT SURE

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.201
WHAT WE HAVE AND THEN A TENER.

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.870
BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.405
OPPORTUNITY FOR. LIKE MINE-

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.005
ESPECIALLY BE THINK ABOUT PAY

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:28.007
YOU BACK THE P. BACK IN THAT

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:29.308
WITH. BROWN FEELS IT WERE ABLE

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:30.643
TO CLEAN UP THOSE BROWNFIELD

01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:33.112
EVER EVER TO TURN THEM INTO

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:33.780
THESE POPULAR FOREST WERE ABLE

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.915
TO THEN CAPTURE WATER WERE ABLE

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:37.316
TO MAKE SURE THAT MY TABLE WATER

01:57:37.383 --> 01:57:39.352
IS HIGHER AND HAVE LESS

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.253
POLLUTION- THAT I'M DEALING WITH

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:41.587
THEIR WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE

01:57:41.654 --> 01:57:43.689
THAT. WE DEAL WITH THIS ON SO

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:44.590
HAVING THIS COMING TOWARD TABLE

01:57:44.657 --> 01:57:46.325
WATER. INSTEAD OF RUNNING OFF

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:47.026
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE COUNTRY

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:49.061
DOESN'T JUST PUSH THAT AWAY- IS

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:50.096
INNOVATIVE AND SO I THINK

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:52.131
THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS. OUT

01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:56.335
THERE ON THAT- THAT'S THAT IN

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:57.203
THE IN THIS URBAN COMMUNITIES

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:59.439
THAT THE DROUGHT ISSUE- WOULD

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:00.706
ACTUALLY BE BENEFITTED WITH

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.041
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SO JUST

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.776
WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT AND I

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:06.746
LIKE TO BE A CLOTH ON YOUR

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:07.380
ABILITY TO KEEP PLAYERS. THANK

01:58:07.447 --> 01:58:11.017
YOU MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:14.754
MADAM CHAIR I JUST CAN'T. GO

UNNOTICED YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:18.825
MADE AN EMERGENCY DROUGHT OR THE

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:22.195
OTHER WEEK AND WENT SO FAR AS TO

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:23.396
SAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EVEN

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:26.466
WATER YOUR LAWN- YOU KNOW

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.801
MENTIONING STORM AFTER WE'VE

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:30.069
ACTUALLY PASSED QUITE A BIT A

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:31.571
LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:33.639
YEARS AIMED AT STORM WATER

01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:36.576
CAPTURE IT TO SEIZE THAT WATER

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:38.878
SO IF YOU GET IT BACK INTO THE

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:42.548
WATER SUPPLY- SO TO MAKE THAT

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.951
ARGUMENT FOR ME IS KIND OF THE

01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:47.153
HERE OR THERE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:49.755
ACTUALLY. MOVING CAPTURE EVERY

01:58:49.822 --> 01:58:53.793
LAST DROP WE CAN- MISTER FLORA

IS AFFECTING US AT A AFFORDABLE

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:06.072
HOUSING ALSO IS WE HAVE HOUSING

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:07.406
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING TURNED

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:08.174
DOWN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:10.176
WATER SO IT'S NOT JUST HURTING A

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:12.512
AGRICULTURAL FARMING STANDPOINT.

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.714
WERE FOLLOWING HUNDREDS OF

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:17.016
THOUSANDS OF ACRES WHICH ISN'T

AFFECTED. OVER WATER SITUATION

01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:31.464

TO THE AUTHOR- IT AFFECTS PEOPLE

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:33.292
THAT AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:35.227
LIFE. WE CAN'T REALLY GO HOME

02:00:35.294 --> 02:00:37.163

KNOW BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES. WHEN

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:41.300
THE FACT IS OUR PEOPLE DON'T

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:43.336
HAVE WATER IT'S RAINING ASHES ON

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:45.671
THEM IN THIS IS PULLING

02:00:45.738 --> 02:00:49.408
RESOURCES AWAY FROM. SO HOW CAN

02:00:49.475 --> 02:00:50.876
MY COLLEAGUES AND I EXPLAINED

THAT TO OUR COMMUNITIES THEY IN

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:55.214
THE VALLEY TO SUPPORT SOMETHING

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:56.949
THEY THINK YOU SEVEN MEMBER

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.351
THERE ARE IS AN EXISTING COPPER

02:00:58.417 --> 02:00:59.418
URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:01.020
GRANT PARK PROGRAM WHICH I WOULD

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:02.722
ARGUE RIGHT NOW THE FACT THAT

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:04.657
THE THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:05.257
FOR TREE PLANTING FOR EXAMPLE

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:08.594
LONGSTREET'S SPACED OUT TREES-

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:10.663
IS ACTUALLY LESS- LESS

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:12.431
PRODUCTIVE USE A WATER PARK OF

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:13.933
COURSE ARE STAYING WITHIN TWO TO

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.534
THREE YEARS AND SO THE REALITIES

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:17.169
EVERY GALLON OF WATER WE CAN

02:01:17.236 --> 02:01:19.038
SAVE IN URBAN AREAS IS ONE MORE

02:01:19.105 --> 02:01:20.106
GALLON THAT BECAME TWENTY YEAR

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:21.774
COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW SO MUCH

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:23.843
RUN UP AS MUCH WATER IS WASTED

02:01:23.909 --> 02:01:25.544
IN URBAN AREAS POCKET FOR US HAD

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:26.812
THE OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY CAPTURE

02:01:26.879 --> 02:01:29.548
THAT WATER AND IT IS THE END NOT

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:30.783
ONLY THATBUT IN PLACES LIKE SAN

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.818
JOSE WE ARE PURPLE PIPES WE HAVE

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:33.753
RECYCLED WATER THAT'S NOT

02:01:33.819 --> 02:01:35.788
POTABLE BUT WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:36.822
FUNCTIONAL BUT THEIR FUNCTION

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.524
FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES WILL BE

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:39.825
FUNCTIONAL FOR THIS AS WELL SO

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.560
WE CAN USE RECYCLED WATER IN

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:43.162
ORDER TO CREATE THAT FIRST TWO

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:44.296
THREE YEARS OF STAYING ABILITY

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.132
AND THEN ASSISTING ABOUT THEIR

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:47.466
ON. GOING FORWARD AND THAT

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.068
DOESN'T THE SCIENTISTS SAY THIS

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:50.436
I'VE BEEN USING NATIVE PLANTS I

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:51.904
BECOME SUSTAINABLE LOOK LOOK

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:54.273
LOOK MORE INTO THE QUALITY PART

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.708
PER BILLION PERCENTAGE FOR

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.009
PURPLE HEART PIPE VERSUS A

02:01:57.076 --> 02:02:05.651
BOTTLE OF WATER IN THOSE NUMBERS. WILL SURPRISE YOU- BUT IT'S- A

THAT WAY TO SET UP ON OFF

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:11.157
SYSTEMS. SO YOU DON'T

02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:13.192
NECESSARILY NEED TO PLANT TREES

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.027

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:43.795
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED.

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:44.629
UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:46.631
COMMUNITY IN THE PROVIDE INPUT

02:16:46.698 --> 02:16:48.233
AND HOW REGULATIONS MIGHT AFFECT

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:54.239
THESE BUSINESSES. WHY WHAT WHY

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:55.807
ARE YOU TARGETING THE E. J.

02:16:55.874 --> 02:16:57.208
SEATS ARE NOT SOMETHING ELSE FOR

02:16:57.275 --> 02:16:58.910
ADDING TO THE AIRPORT WHY

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:00.045
SPECIFICALLY ARE WE ADDING THIS

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:02.113
EXTRA COMPONENT TO THE AG SEATS

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:05.150
THAT. WE HAVE. I'M JUST TRYING

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:06.484
TO HAVE REPRESENTATION FOR

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:07.752
VOICES THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:09.554
IN CALIFORNIA BUT SMALL BUSINESS

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:11.256
OWNERS ON AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:12.958
BUT WE DO HAVE SMALL BUSINESS

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:14.059
OWNERS ON THAT FOR THAT HAVE

02:17:14.125 --> 02:17:15.226
LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:16.628
ACTUALLY PHILLY ARE BEING

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.663
REPRESENTED PRESENTLY. MAYBE

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:21.333
IT'S NOT GUARANTEED- AND SO. SO

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:22.701
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

02:17:22.767 --> 02:17:24.002
THAT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND OR

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:26.004
READ DOING THAT AT THE EXPENSE

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:27.205
OF THE HEAT OF AN AGENCY

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:28.773
POTENTIALLY. OF NOT JUST TO THE

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:30.108
POINT WE BY THE SENATE RULES

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:31.943
COMMITTEE TO HAVE A SMALL

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:32.944
BUSINESS OWNER WHO WE'VE TALKED

02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:34.546
ABOUT IT I KNOW THE ANALYSIS

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:35.347
SAYS THAT THERE'S BUSINESS

02:17:35.413 --> 02:17:37.649
OWNERS. I AM NOT SURE IF THEY'RE

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:39.184
FIFTY EMPLOYEES OR LESS. SO IF

02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:42.354
YOU GET THAT ANSWERED THEM

02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:43.455
THERE'S NO. NEEDED FOR THE BILL

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:44.723
YES IF THEY IF THEY WITH

02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:47.092
ANSWERS. IT SAID THAT BUT I

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.560
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE SMALLER

02:17:48.627 --> 02:17:51.463
THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES I REQUEST.

02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:52.831
OKAY ARE YOU MISTER SPEAKER

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.733
YOU'VE DONE SOLVED WHAT I MEAN

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:56.768
IF I AND I WILL NOT BE

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:58.103
SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK

02:17:58.169 --> 02:17:59.671
IT'S NOTABLE THAT YOU WANT TO

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:01.206
MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESS PLACES.

02:18:01.272 --> 02:18:02.841
ARE INCLUDED AT THE AIR DISTRICT

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:04.476
AND IN THEORY. THAT IS SOMETHING

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:07.078
THAT WE CAN DISCUSS I JUST DON'T

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:08.880
SEE IT AT THE EXPENSE OF AN E.

02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:10.882
J. C. WHEN WE HAVE. HUNDREDS OF

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:12.050
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:15.053
THAT BLACK REPRESENTATION IN THE

02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:17.489
SEVEN TWO HARD FOUGHT FOR SEATS

02:18:17.555 --> 02:18:19.724
FOR MANY YEARS OUT THERE AND SO.

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.893
I WOULD WANT TO SEE A DIFFERENT

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.895
WAY TO GET TO YOUR GOAL AND SO

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:24.896
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE BOTH A

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:26.931
PROBLEM IT'S- IT'S THAT IT'S

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:27.866
THAT I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS I

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:30.235
pWOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE. THAT WE

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:30.769
GET THAT ANSWER ABOUT THE

02:18:30.835 --> 02:18:32.404
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE AT THEIR

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:33.938
DISTRICT AND- THE SIZE OF THEIR

02:18:34.005 --> 02:18:38.543
BUSINESSES- PERIOD FOR. FOR THE

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:39.944
AUTHOR OF THE BILL. IT APPOINTEE

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:41.446
OF THE IN VAI MENTAL JUST.

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:43.214
APPOINTEE IS A BUSINESS OWNER OF

02:18:43.281 --> 02:18:45.350
FIFTY LESS. EMPLOYEES

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:46.751
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WOULD SUPPORT IT

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.353
. I THINK THAT LIMITED THAT'S A

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:49.821
REALLY NARROW DEFINITION AND

02:18:49.888 --> 02:18:51.423
WITHIN THE EACH A COMMUNITY AT

02:18:51.489 --> 02:18:52.757
ADVOCATE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:53.792
DIFFERENT NEEDS OUT THERE AND I

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:56.027
HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT ADDING AN

02:18:56.094 --> 02:18:57.762
EXTRA REQUIREMENT LIKE THIS ON

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.130
THAT TO GET YOUR WILL OF HAVING

02:18:59.197 --> 02:19:01.232
SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATION.

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:05.003
ON THE BOARD. OKAY MISTER SEA.

02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:06.871
OKAY SO IT'S A REALLY WHAT THIS

02:19:06.938 --> 02:19:08.973
DOES IS JUST GUARANTEE THAT THEY

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:09.841
HAVE. THE SMALL BUSINESS DOES

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.643
HAVE A SEAT AT THE BOARD WHETHER

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:13.812
OR NOT THEY HAVE ONE NOW. IS OF

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:15.814
NO CONSEQUENCE OTHER THAN THEY

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.348
GOT LUCKY IN AND HAVE SOMEBODY

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:19.217
THAT'S THERE. THOSE PEOPLE WOULD

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:21.352
BE RAISED AND THEN THERE'D BE NO

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:22.020
REPRESENTATION ALL THIS DOES IS

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:24.289
ENSURE THAT THERE IS RAMPANT IN

02:19:24.355 --> 02:19:26.091
TATIAN IS THAT CORRECT YES SIR

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:29.427
THANK YOU. MR STONE. THANK YOU

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:31.362
THIS ABSOLUTELY DILUTES THE

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:32.197
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:19:32.263 --> 02:19:33.798
REPRESENTATION ON THE AIRPORT

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:38.503
AND I CANNOT SUPPORT. MR FLOOR I

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:40.071
THINK IN IN THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR

02:19:40.138 --> 02:19:41.740
BILL AT THEM IN THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:19:41.806 --> 02:19:43.375
TWO APPOINTEES ASSESS THAT

02:19:43.441 --> 02:19:44.409
SHOCKING TO SHE CAN'T APPOINT TO

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:46.144
PUBLIC MEMBERS CORRECT SIR SO

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:47.645
CAN BE ONE OF THOSE TWO

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:48.613
POSITIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.848
COULD APPOINT YEAH CORRECT. THEY

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.049
WHICH DOES NOT NECESSARILY

02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:52.784
ATTACKING THE J. SEAT

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:54.953
NECESSARILY NOT AT ALL YOU DON'T

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:56.221
PARTICULARLY CARE WHERE IT COMES

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:58.156
FROM NO. WE JUST WANT A SMALL

02:19:58.223 --> 02:19:59.524
BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE ON THE

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.559

THANK YOU HAVE A POINT OF ORDER

AJC APPOINTED BY THE SENATE

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:09.000
RULES CHAIR AND I DON'T THINK

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.101
IT'S OUR BUSINESS IN THE

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.936
ASSEMBLY TO TELL SENATE RULES.

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:13.538
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE APPOINTING

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.340
NOR SHOULD WE BE INTERFERING

02:20:15.406 --> 02:20:16.808
WITH A HARD FOUGHT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:19.277
JUSTICE COMPONENT ON THE AIRPORT

02:20:19.344 --> 02:20:21.379
AND I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY

02:20:21.446 --> 02:20:23.448
FROM THE E. J. COMMUNITY. THIRTY

THEY HAVE FOURTEEN APPOINTMENTS

02:43:49.819 --> 02:43:56.259
WERE WERE MADE IN PART TO HELP.

02:43:56.326 --> 02:43:57.527
WITH STORAGE THOSE CLAM SHELLS

02:43:57.594 --> 02:43:59.162
HELP WITH TRANSPORTATION THOSE

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:01.164
CLAM SHELLS HELP REDUCE DAMAGE

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:03.200
OF BERRIES WHICH THEN ALLOW FOR

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.834
THEM TO STAY ON THE SHELVES A

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:07.070
LONGER AND ACTUALLY CONSUMERS TO

02:44:07.137 --> 02:44:09.172
ACCESS THEM. SO WE'RE NOT

02:44:09.239 --> 02:44:11.408
OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF INCREASE

02:44:11.474 --> 02:44:13.043
RECYCLED CONTENT BECAUSE WE

02:44:13.109 --> 02:44:15.011
THINK WE'VE BEEN LEADING ON IT

02:44:15.078 --> 02:44:17.480
AND IN FACT CREE COVE IT- MOST

02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:19.516
BERRY CONTAINERS- IF NOT ALL

02:44:19.583 --> 02:44:22.018
BERRY CONTAINERS I HAD OVER 20%

02:44:22.085 --> 02:44:24.254
RECYCLED CONTENT IN THEM BUT AS

02:44:24.321 --> 02:44:25.989
WAS POINTED OUT BY THE AUTHORS

02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:28.558
MOST OF THAT RECYCLE CONTENT

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:31.127
CAME FROM. BOTTLES OUR CONCERN

02:44:31.194 --> 02:44:33.930
WITH THE BILL IS SET IS WE DON'T

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:36.266
SEE AS OF RIGHT NOW HOW IT

02:44:36.333 --> 02:44:38.969
DRESSES THE BACK IN ISSUES OF

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.670
ACTUALLY CREATING THE COLLECTION

02:44:40.737 --> 02:44:42.305
MECHANISMS. MANY LOCAL

02:44:42.372 --> 02:44:44.741
GOVERNMENTS TODAY WILL TELL

02:44:44.808 --> 02:44:46.943
CONSUMERS NOT TO PUT THESE.

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:49.246
CONTAINERS IN THEIR BLUE BANDS

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:51.214
AND IF SB THREE FORTY THREE

02:44:51.281 --> 02:44:52.515
MOVES FORWARD AND THESE

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:54.384
CONTAINERS DO NOT RECEIVE OR

02:44:54.451 --> 02:44:56.152
ACHIEVE THE GOALS ESTABLISHING

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:57.921
SB THREE FORTY THREE THAT WERE

02:44:57.988 --> 02:44:59.122
SIGNED LAST YEAR. THE ACTUAL

02:44:59.189 --> 02:45:00.790
CHASING ARROWS THAT SAYS THAT

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:03.226
THE RECYCLABLE WILL BE TAKEN OFF

02:45:03.293 --> 02:45:05.161
OF THESE CONTAINERS. AND SO.

02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:07.197
THAT'S ONE ELEMENT THE OTHER

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.765
ELEMENT IS YES THEY COULD BE

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:12.135
SORTED TODAY- BY THE WASTE

02:45:12.202 --> 02:45:13.937
HAULERS BUT THEY'RE NOT. AND THE

02:45:14.004 --> 02:45:15.672
WASTE HAULERS ARE ACTUALLY PAID

02:45:15.739 --> 02:45:17.707
WHAT THEY CALL A CO MINGLED

02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:19.676
RIGHT. WHICH THEN ALLOWS THEM TO

02:45:19.743 --> 02:45:22.145
BRING PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:23.580
THERMAL SHIRT CLAMPETT THURMOND

02:45:23.647 --> 02:45:24.848
THERMAL FORM CLAM SHELLS

02:45:24.914 --> 02:45:27.817
TOGETHER AND GET PAID FOR THAT.

02:45:27.884 --> 02:45:30.020
WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.554
GREATER INCENTIVES SOMEONE

02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:34.190
CALLED THEM PENALTIES. ON CO

02:45:34.257 --> 02:45:36.226
MINGLE GREAT- WHERE WE'RE

02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:37.894
ACTUALLY ENTICING AND WORK

02:45:37.961 --> 02:45:40.430
INCENTIVIZE SEEN THOSE TO THOSE

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:42.866
TO ACTUALLY BE SEPARATED AND

02:45:42.932 --> 02:45:45.869
THEN MADE INTO THERMAL FORMER

02:45:45.935 --> 02:45:47.103
CYCLE CONTENT. AND THEN IT'S

02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:49.572
FANTASTIC THAT IF THE BILL WERE

02:45:49.639 --> 02:45:50.307
TO SAY- THERMOFORMED THERMAL

02:45:50.373 --> 02:45:51.975
FORM WERE NOT CLEAR THAT IT SAYS

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.743
THAT YET AND WOULD REALLY LIKE

02:45:53.810 --> 02:45:55.679
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. OUR FINAL

02:45:55.745 --> 02:45:57.213
POINT IN CONCERN IS JUST WITH

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:58.982
SOME OF THE LEVELS OF RECYCLING

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:01.284
IN THE GOALS DOES A SEVENTY FIVE

02:46:01.351 --> 02:46:05.188
PERCENT- WE THINK THAT- THAT IS

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:06.823
PROBABLY UNACHIEVABLE IN THE

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:09.326
SHORT RUN. WE LOOK AT A BOTTLE

02:46:09.392 --> 02:46:10.627
BILL THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:12.896
THAT HAS BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL-

02:46:12.962 --> 02:46:15.398
AND THE GOVERNOR I JUST ISSUED A

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:17.334
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL LAST WEEK

02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.502
LOOKING TO ADD A HUNDRED MILLION

02:46:19.569 --> 02:46:20.970
DOLLARS TO THAT PROGRAM

02:46:21.037 --> 02:46:23.073
SPECIFICALLY HE SPECIFICALLY TO

02:46:23.139 --> 02:46:25.075
INCREASE THE RECYCLING RATES. OF

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:26.843
CONTAINERS THAT ALREADY HAVE A

02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:29.312
DEPOSIT AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE

02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:31.414
TO TAKE BACK SO. WE HAVE

02:46:31.481 --> 02:46:33.483
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. ARE THEY

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:35.418
INSURMOUNTABLE NO WE HAD THE

02:46:35.485 --> 02:46:37.487
OPEN CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR

02:46:37.554 --> 02:46:39.322
ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET THERE BUT

02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:40.724
WE DO THINK THAT THESE ARE SOME

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:42.726
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL STEPS THAT

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:44.694
NEED TO BE PUT INTO THE BACK

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:46.763
INTO THE PROP WITH THE PROCESS.

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:48.898
TO ENSURE IT IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:50.734
HAVE A RECYCLED CONTENT ELEMENT

02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:52.302
ON THE FRONT END. THAT THOSE ARE

02:46:52.369 --> 02:46:55.138
ACTUALLY COLLECTED SEPARATED

02:46:55.205 --> 02:46:56.740
BAILED AND PUT BACK INTO THE

02:46:56.806 --> 02:47:00.276
PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT

02:47:00.343 --> 02:47:02.078

FINANCING MISTER BROWN POINTED

OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT

02:48:02.038 --> 02:48:03.740
LIKE THE TO GO INTO A LITTLE

02:48:03.807 --> 02:48:06.810
MORE DETAIL- VOLUMES ARE REALLY

02:48:06.876 --> 02:48:10.213
IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:12.348
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- FORM SO P.

02:48:12.415 --> 02:48:15.185

02:48:32.502 --> 02:48:35.438
ARE LESS THAN 1% OF THAT ONE

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:36.706
PERCENT. CONSULT FROM THAT

02:48:36.773 --> 02:48:38.675
PERSPECTIVE WE THINK IF THEY'RE

02:48:38.741 --> 02:48:39.709
STILL GONNA SIX FEET SHOULD BE

02:48:39.776 --> 02:48:42.512
FOCUSED ON P. P. THERMAL FORMS.

02:48:42.579 --> 02:48:44.848

KEEP UP WITH THEM SO WE DON'T.

02:48:58.428 --> 02:48:59.496
BELIEVE WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE OR

02:48:59.562 --> 02:49:00.930
EXPERTISE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

02:49:00.997 --> 02:49:03.600
ANY RESIDENTS WISHING. TO AVOID

02:49:03.666 --> 02:49:05.668
THIS TYPE OF REGULATION. BUT IT

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:08.137
IS CHALLENGING AND ONE OF THE

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:12.408
REASONS THAT. THE AT EIGHT CARRY

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:13.910
SUPPOSED THE BILL THIS YEAR IS

02:49:13.977 --> 02:49:15.345
IT- WHAT NEXT BROWN TALKED ABOUT

02:49:15.411 --> 02:49:17.947
THIS BILL BUT NOTHING TO ADDRESS

02:49:18.014 --> 02:49:19.949
THOSE VOLUMES AND COLLECTION AND

02:49:20.016 --> 02:49:22.352
SORTATION IN THE CO MINGLE GREAT

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:24.654
LAST YEAR AB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT

02:49:24.721 --> 02:49:26.055
DID SPEAK AND DID TRY TO ACHIEVE

02:49:26.122 --> 02:49:28.725
SOME TYPE OF COMPROMISE OR

02:49:28.791 --> 02:49:30.393
RESOLUTION TO THE COMMINGLED

02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:32.128
RATE BUT WHAT HAPPENS REALLY IN

02:49:32.195 --> 02:49:35.198
IN A MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY

02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:37.734
IS AMER POPPER RIDER I CAN HAVE

02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:40.169
A VERY CLEAN BAIL OF P. E. T.

02:49:40.236 --> 02:49:41.771
BOTTLES WHICH WE WANT TO BECOME

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.573
BOTTLES. AND THE COMMINGLED RATE

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.241
THEY MAY GET UNDERPAID FOR THAT

02:49:45.308 --> 02:49:48.545
BAIL THEY HAVE SUCH A CLEAN.

02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:50.613

BAIL THEY COULD POTENTIALLY ARE

02:49:55.184 --> 02:49:56.052
MOST LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:57.921

SYSTEM WORKS TODAY. IT IS BROWN

02:50:03.993 --> 02:50:05.562
SAID I DON'T THINK THERE'S-

02:50:05.628 --> 02:50:07.363
THERE ARE HURDLES THAT CANNOT BE

02:50:07.430 --> 02:50:08.831
OVERCOME I THINK THEY CAN'T BE

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.400
OVERCOME BUT UNLESS YOU ADDRESS

THAT BEING RESOLVED IT JUST

02:50:18.007 --> 02:50:19.609
BECOMES THE TAX FOR A FEE ON

FORMS WITH BOTTLES AND- WORKING

02:55:34.690 --> 02:55:37.159
TO INCENTIVIZE IT'S THE FIRST TO

02:55:37.226 --> 02:55:39.428
SORT THEM SEPARATELY. YOU KNOW

02:55:39.495 --> 02:55:40.863
WE KEPT REFERRING TO THE

02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:43.733
BEVERAGE BILL AND OF MR TANG AND

02:55:43.799 --> 02:55:45.801
I WORKED ON THAT I THINK IT WAS

02:55:45.868 --> 02:55:47.770
TWO YEARS AGO THAT WAS A BILL

02:55:47.837 --> 02:55:48.905
THAT IT IT TOOK THREE OR FOUR

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:51.474
YEARS TO PASS AND IT WAS AGAIN A

02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:54.010
BALANCING ACT AND SOME OF THE

02:55:54.076 --> 02:55:56.078
MEMBERS WERE COMPLETELY OPPOSED

02:55:56.145 --> 02:55:57.780
TO THE ENTIRE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE

02:55:57.847 --> 02:56:01.017
WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW- THEY ARE

02:56:01.083 --> 02:56:03.953
THE THREE BEVERAGE COMPANIES ARE

02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:06.188
BRAGGING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:07.790
MEET 50% MINIMUM RECYCLED

02:56:07.857 --> 02:56:10.226
CONTENT AND THAT IS THE HIGHEST

02:56:10.293 --> 02:56:13.429
STANDARD IN THE WORLD. AND THEY

02:56:13.496 --> 02:56:14.931
ARE SAYING THAT THEY CAN DO IT

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:16.999
SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT BILL

02:56:17.066 --> 02:56:18.901
IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK AND

02:56:18.968 --> 02:56:21.337
IT TOOK A BIG BALANCING ACT AND

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:22.004
WE EXPECT TO DO EXACTLY THIS WE

02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:23.773
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL

02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:25.408
THE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE WE NEED

02:56:32.915 --> 02:56:34.283
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:35.151

02:56:35.217 --> 02:56:36.752

RATE THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OUT WE

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:41.791

THEY'RE ALREADY THERE I DID THAT

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:00.109

03:07:39.915 --> 03:07:41.917
WANT TO BE AS CLOSE AS WE CAN

03:07:41.984 --> 03:07:44.119
IDEALLY THE SAME AS THE EUROPEAN

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:46.855
UNION. SO THAT THERE IS ALREADY

03:07:46.922 --> 03:07:49.057
SOMETHING THAT THE- BECAUSE

03:07:49.124 --> 03:07:50.792
MEDIC COMPANIES CAN DO THE FRANK

03:07:50.859 --> 03:07:53.295
WHICH COMPANIES COULD DO THAT IS

03:07:53.362 --> 03:07:56.098
COMPATIBLE- FOR WHICH THERE IS A

03:07:56.164 --> 03:07:57.766
MARKET AND THEN WE CAN ENCOURAGE

03:07:57.833 --> 03:08:02.804
THAT SAME- THAT SAME PROCESS TO

03:08:02.871 --> 03:08:05.607
BE BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA. AND

03:08:05.674 --> 03:08:06.742
HOPEFULLY TO THE REST OF THE

ROCKMAN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:47.983
WORKING AS A PROFESSOR AT THE

03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:49.885
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO I HAVE

03:08:49.951 --> 03:08:51.420
BEEN RESEARCHING MICROPLASTICS

03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:53.355
SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN I

03:08:53.422 --> 03:08:54.222
STARTED MY PHD HERE IN

03:08:54.289 --> 03:08:56.391
CALIFORNIA. I ALSO RECENTLY

03:08:56.458 --> 03:08:57.893
SERVED AS A COLD LEAD TO

03:08:57.959 --> 03:08:59.361
CALIFORNIA WORKING GROUP'S ON

03:08:59.428 --> 03:09:01.196

MICROPLASTICS AND ANOTHER ON

03:09:07.869 --> 03:09:10.138
RISK IN ADDITION I WAS ADVISOR

03:09:10.205 --> 03:09:13.208
TO THE OPC ON THEIR STATEWIDE

03:09:13.275 --> 03:09:14.476
MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY. THERE IS

03:09:14.543 --> 03:09:15.911
NO SCIENTIFIC DOUBT THAT

03:09:15.977 --> 03:09:17.746
MICROPLASTICS ARE A WIDESPREAD

03:09:17.813 --> 03:09:20.515
CONTAMINANT. MICROPLASTICS CYCLE

03:09:20.582 --> 03:09:21.750
GLOBALLY AND THE DEATH CYCLE THE

03:09:21.817 --> 03:09:23.552

BLOOD. LOCALLY IN COLLABORATION

03:09:28.957 --> 03:09:30.559
WITH AT THAT THE AYE WE FOUND

03:09:30.625 --> 03:09:32.227
RELATIVELY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS

03:09:32.294 --> 03:09:33.829
OF MICROPLASTICS IN SURFACE

03:09:33.895 --> 03:09:35.464
WATERS AND SEDIMENTS WITHIN THE

03:09:35.530 --> 03:09:38.600
SAN FRANCISCO BAY WE ALSO FOUND

03:09:38.667 --> 03:09:40.402
AND LOCAL FISH AND SHELLFISH.

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:42.037
TODAY THERE IS IRREFUTABLE

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:44.106
EVIDENCE THAT MICROPLASTICS CAN

03:09:44.172 --> 03:09:46.208
LEAD TO ADVERSE THE FACT. THE

03:09:46.274 --> 03:09:47.476
FACTORS INCLUDE DECREASED

03:09:47.542 --> 03:09:49.077
FEEDING DELAYED DEVELOPMENTS

03:09:49.144 --> 03:09:50.979
DECREASED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS

03:09:51.046 --> 03:09:52.914
AND MORTALITY WITHIN OUR

03:09:52.981 --> 03:09:54.382
CALIFORNIA WORKING GROUP WE

03:09:54.449 --> 03:09:55.884
DEVELOPED A THRESHOLD COOPER

03:09:55.951 --> 03:09:57.452
RISK THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE

03:09:57.519 --> 03:09:59.254
CONCENTRATIONS WE OBSERVED IN

03:09:59.321 --> 03:10:01.089
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. ALTHOUGH

03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:03.058
DO WE DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND

03:10:03.125 --> 03:10:04.626
HOW MICROPLASTICS AFFECT HUMAN

03:10:04.693 --> 03:10:06.661

LOCAL RISK EXACT GOVERNMENT

03:10:14.236 --> 03:10:15.437
SHOULD REDUCE SOURCES OF

MICROPLASTIC NOW BEFORE THEY

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:18.974
TRANSFORM ECOSYSTEMS ARE

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:21.376
RAPIDLY. FOR MICROPLASTICS

03:10:21.443 --> 03:10:23.278
CLEANUP IS NOT FEASIBLE IT IS

03:10:23.345 --> 03:10:25.413
CRITICAL THAT POLICIES REDUCE

03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:27.149
PLASTIC POLLUTION AT ITS SOURCE.

03:10:27.215 --> 03:10:28.650
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY SOURCES

03:10:28.717 --> 03:10:30.585
OF MICROPLASTICS POLICIES THAT

03:10:30.652 --> 03:10:32.087
TARGET ONE AT A TIME ARE

03:10:32.154 --> 03:10:34.222
RELEVANT AND EFFECTIVE. FOR

03:10:34.289 --> 03:10:35.957

INDUSTRY SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE

03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:23.398
. LET ME START BY NOTING THAT WE

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:24.065
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MICRO

03:12:24.132 --> 03:12:27.035
PLASTIC. POLLUTION IS A PROBLEM

03:12:27.102 --> 03:12:28.503
THAT WILL REQUIRE CREATIVE

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:32.407
SOLUTIONS. BUT AS DRAFTED AB

03:12:32.474 --> 03:12:33.108
TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:34.976
OVERLY BROAD FAILS TO CONSIDER

03:12:35.043 --> 03:12:36.378
MANY OF THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED

03:12:36.444 --> 03:12:38.313
INNOVATIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY

03:12:38.380 --> 03:12:41.149
AND SEEKS TO ADDRESS ONLY 1% OF

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:42.450
THE TOTAL PROBLEM THEY'RE

03:12:42.517 --> 03:12:44.085
EXTRAORDINARILY HARSH MESSAGE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND JUST AS

03:12:55.363 --> 03:12:57.165
A REMINDER THOSE CATEGORIES WERE

03:12:57.232 --> 03:13:00.201
VEHICLE TIRES TEXTILES SINGLE

03:13:08.677 --> 03:13:10.612
THE ISSUE OF MICROPLASTICS AND

03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:12.881
FOUND THAT THE PRODUCTS TARGETED

03:13:12.948 --> 03:13:14.983
IN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN.

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:18.086
ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO LESS THAN 1%

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:20.088
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ZERO POINT

03:13:20.155 --> 03:13:22.724
2% OF THE TOTAL MICRO PLASTICS

03:13:22.791 --> 03:13:24.793
GLOBALLY. NOT ONLY IS IT

03:13:24.859 --> 03:13:27.095
TROUBLING THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN

03:13:27.162 --> 03:13:28.863
EIGHTY SEVEN TARGETS ONE OF THE

03:13:28.930 --> 03:13:30.165
LOWEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:31.099
OVERALL MICROPLASTICS PROBLEM.

03:13:31.166 --> 03:13:32.167
BUT DEPENDING ON HOW

03:13:32.233 --> 03:13:33.735
MICROPLASTICS IS ULTIMATELY

03:13:33.802 --> 03:13:35.670
DEFINED THE FACT OF THE BILL

03:13:35.737 --> 03:13:37.339
WOULD DECIMATE AN ENTIRE

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:39.441
INDUSTRY BY BANNING MANY OF THE

03:13:39.507 --> 03:13:41.109
COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE

03:13:41.176 --> 03:13:42.143
PRODUCTS THAT CONSUMERS FIND

03:13:42.210 --> 03:13:44.479
ESSENTIAL TODAY. FOR A LOW AND

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:46.147
IN SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL

03:13:46.214 --> 03:13:48.249
RETURN ON INVESTMENT. THE REASON

03:13:48.316 --> 03:13:49.784
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A DE FACTO

03:13:49.851 --> 03:13:52.253
BAN IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A ONE

03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:53.388
TO ONE SUBSTITUTE FOR MANY OF

03:13:53.455 --> 03:13:55.156
THE NON PLASTIC POLYMERS THAT WE

03:13:55.223 --> 03:13:56.257
USE TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS

03:13:56.324 --> 03:13:58.927
WATERPROOF LONG LASTING. AMONG

03:13:58.994 --> 03:14:01.496
MANY OTHER USES THAT CONSUMERS

03:14:01.563 --> 03:14:02.831
FIND USEFUL. AND BECAUSE OF THIS

03:14:02.897 --> 03:14:04.132
BANNING ANY OF THESE POLYMERS

03:14:04.199 --> 03:14:05.834
WOULD REQUIRE US TO REFORMULATE

03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:08.203
THE ENTIRE PRODUCT. AS WELL AS

03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:10.005
FIND A SUITABLE SUBSTITUTE WHICH

03:14:10.071 --> 03:14:12.107
WILL TAKE SEVERAL DECADES. IT'S

03:14:12.173 --> 03:14:13.308
ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

03:14:13.375 --> 03:14:14.943
REMEMBER THAT ALL PLASTICS ARE

03:14:15.010 --> 03:14:16.511
POLYMERS BUT NOT ALL POLYMERS

03:14:16.578 --> 03:14:18.713
ARE PLASTIC. MANY OF THE

03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:20.348
POLYMERS THAT OUR INDUSTRY USES

03:14:20.415 --> 03:14:22.017
TODAY ARE LIKE WHEN A WAX FORM

03:14:22.083 --> 03:14:24.085
AND ARE NOT PLASTIC PARTICLES

03:14:24.152 --> 03:14:25.186
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLASTIC

03:14:25.253 --> 03:14:27.355
MARINE LITTER PROBLEM. AND WHILE

03:14:27.422 --> 03:14:28.456
WE APPRECIATE THE STATEMENT THAT

03:14:28.523 --> 03:14:30.025
MICRO PLASTICS ARE UBIQUITOUS IN

03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:31.659
THE WATER AND AIR BECAUSE OUR

03:14:31.726 --> 03:14:33.294
INDUSTRY IS A LOW CONTRIBUTED TO

03:14:33.361 --> 03:14:34.963
THE PROBLEM WE WOULD POINT TO

03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:36.698
THE SOURCES REFERENCED ABOVE. AS

03:14:36.765 --> 03:14:38.767
POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE

03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:40.835
PROBLEM RATHER THAN US. THE FACT

03:14:40.902 --> 03:14:42.070
OF THE MATTER THE FACT OF THE

03:14:42.137 --> 03:14:44.039
MATTER IS THAT THE E. U. HAS

03:14:44.105 --> 03:14:45.473
BEEN DEBATING THIS ISSUE OF

03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:46.408
MICROPLASTIC REGULATIONS FOR ALL

NINE ONE THIRTEEN. CAN YOU THINK

03:23:40.041 --> 03:23:41.609
WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL

03:23:41.676 --> 03:23:42.944

YOU MISTER CORPORATE RING THIS

03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:01.262
BEFORE A COUPLE JUST A COUPLE OF

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:03.764
QUESTIONS FOR. I AM CURIOUS AS

03:24:03.831 --> 03:24:06.033
TO WHY THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY

03:24:06.100 --> 03:24:08.002
WHICH REPRESENTS A TINY PORTION.

03:24:08.069 --> 03:24:10.504
OF MICROPLASTICS WHEN YOU'VE GOT

03:24:10.571 --> 03:24:11.839
NINETY NINE PLUS PERCENT OF

03:24:11.906 --> 03:24:13.507
OTHER FERTILE GROUND OUT THERE

03:24:13.574 --> 03:24:15.710
SO CAN YOU SPELL. THE REASON I

03:24:15.776 --> 03:24:18.012
THINK FOR THAT NUMBER HAS TO DO

03:24:18.079 --> 03:24:19.981
WITH RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE ON

03:24:20.047 --> 03:24:21.716
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY BY THE

03:24:21.782 --> 03:24:23.951
ESTUARY INSTITUTE. WHAT THEY

03:24:24.018 --> 03:24:26.554
FOUND IS THAT THERE'S ALMOST NO

03:24:26.621 --> 03:24:28.489
POLLUTION COMING OUT OF THE

03:24:28.556 --> 03:24:29.090
SENATE. THE FROM THE SEWAGE

03:24:29.156 --> 03:24:31.192
TREATMENT PLANTS THE BIG PROBLEM

03:24:31.258 --> 03:24:33.327
WITH STORM RUNOFF AND WITH STORE

03:24:33.394 --> 03:24:36.364
RUNOFF YOU GOT TIRES AND FIBERS.

03:24:36.430 --> 03:24:38.332
PERHAPS THE FIBERS YOU'RE COMING

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:40.635
FROM- WASHING MACHINES I'M NOT

03:24:40.701 --> 03:24:43.604
SURE. HOWEVER WE DO DO NOT ONLY

03:24:43.671 --> 03:24:46.841
FROM THIS- THAT THIS BILL EXCUSE

03:24:46.907 --> 03:24:48.242
ME FOR THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE

03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:49.910
SOURCES OF PLASTIC BUT THERE'S

03:24:49.977 --> 03:24:53.581
ALSO THE PLASTIC COMES OFF FROM

03:24:53.648 --> 03:24:54.615
OUR CLOTHES WE WASH THEM. BUT IT

03:24:54.682 --> 03:24:56.017
ISN'T COMING OUT OF THE SEWAGE

03:24:56.083 --> 03:24:57.652
TREATMENT PLANT SO WHERE IS IT.

03:24:57.718 --> 03:24:59.720
I THINK THE ANSWER IS IT'S IN

03:24:59.787 --> 03:25:01.689
THE BIO SOLIDS IN THE PLANTS.

03:25:01.756 --> 03:25:03.024
BUT IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE

03:25:03.090 --> 03:25:04.692
SYSTEM BUT THAT ISN'T MEASURED

03:25:04.759 --> 03:25:06.060
IN TERMS OF WHAT GOES INTO THE

03:25:06.127 --> 03:25:08.496
BAY NOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

03:25:08.562 --> 03:25:12.066
BIO SOLIDS. IS THERE GOING OUT-

03:25:12.133 --> 03:25:15.936
AND THERE'S A- MAJOR- EFFORT NOW

03:25:16.003 --> 03:25:17.805
TO GET THEM OUT ON TO FARM LANDS

03:25:17.872 --> 03:25:19.874
TO BE USED AS FERTILIZER. THAT

03:25:19.940 --> 03:25:21.308
MEANS OF THE PLASTICS THAT ARE

03:25:21.375 --> 03:25:22.943
COMING OUT OF OUR WASHING

03:25:23.010 --> 03:25:25.780
MACHINES AND- THE GOING DOWN THE

03:25:25.846 --> 03:25:27.448
DRAIN IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

03:25:27.515 --> 03:25:29.583
WE'RE GOING TO END UP ON A FARM

03:25:29.650 --> 03:25:31.018
LAND. FOR WHICH THEY WILL GET

03:25:31.085 --> 03:25:32.086
INTO STREAMS ETCETERA SO WELL

03:25:32.153 --> 03:25:34.755
IT'S NOT A MAJOR SOURCE OF

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:36.624
POLLUTION TO THE BAY. WHICH IS

03:25:36.691 --> 03:25:37.858
WHERE THE RESEARCH WAS DONE IT

03:25:37.925 --> 03:25:40.594
IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF

03:25:40.661 --> 03:25:41.295
POLLUTION. ANYWHERE WHEN YOU

03:25:41.362 --> 03:25:43.230
TAKE THESE BIOSOLIDS AND PUT

03:25:43.297 --> 03:25:45.733
THEM ON PLANT. THAT'S FARMLAND

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.835
THAT'S FOOD CONTAMINATION THAT'S

03:25:47.902 --> 03:25:50.738
HUMAN CONTAMINATION. THAT'S

03:25:50.805 --> 03:25:51.739
CONTAMINATION OF WATER IN

03:25:51.806 --> 03:25:53.607
STREAMS. DO YOU DOES ANYBODY

03:25:53.674 --> 03:25:54.875
KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

03:25:54.942 --> 03:25:56.677
PROBLEM THAT IS I MEAN WHY NOT

03:25:56.744 --> 03:25:58.312
BURY THE BIOSOLIDS RATHER THAN

03:25:58.379 --> 03:26:01.082
USE THEM FOR FERTILIZER. WELL I

03:26:01.148 --> 03:26:03.350
WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT.

03:26:03.417 --> 03:26:04.985
AND IF WE DID THAT WE WOULD NEED

03:26:05.052 --> 03:26:06.554
THAT BILL BUT THAT'S NOT THE

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:08.289
DIRECTION THE STATE'S GOING IN.

03:26:08.355 --> 03:26:12.460
SO YOU KNOW. IF YOU IF YOU THINK

03:26:12.526 --> 03:26:14.462
THAT ALL THE BIOSOLIDS SHOULD GO

03:26:14.528 --> 03:26:16.664
INTO SANITARY LANDFILLS THEN YOU

03:26:16.731 --> 03:26:19.166
WOULD NEED THE BILL. BUT THE

03:26:19.233 --> 03:26:21.569
STATE WANTS TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO

03:26:21.635 --> 03:26:24.872
USE THOSE BIOSOLIDS ON FARMLAND.

03:26:24.939 --> 03:26:27.508
AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO DO

03:26:27.575 --> 03:26:28.109
THAT YOU BETTER MAKE SURE IT

03:26:28.175 --> 03:26:30.511
DOESN'T HAVE PLASTICS- SO FIRST

03:26:30.578 --> 03:26:31.779
I NEVER SAY I'M I'M HAPPY THAT

03:26:31.846 --> 03:26:33.681
YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE E. U.

03:26:33.748 --> 03:26:35.750
IS DOING- YEAH AND I HAVE TO

03:26:35.816 --> 03:26:37.785
LOOK. IF I DON'T ALIGN WITH THE

03:26:37.852 --> 03:26:39.386
E. U. THEN THERE'S NOT REALLY

03:26:39.453 --> 03:26:40.788
CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK IT'S

03:26:40.855 --> 03:26:42.723
ENOUGH OF A MARKET. TO RELEASE

03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:44.825
TO STAY THE STRATEGY WE REALLY

03:26:44.892 --> 03:26:47.061
HAVE TO ALIGN WITH THE E. U. OR

03:26:47.128 --> 03:26:49.330
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT NOW IS WHAT

03:26:49.396 --> 03:26:50.931
TO THE E. U. STANDARDS DO AND

03:26:50.998 --> 03:26:53.200
WHAT DID THEY NOT DO. AND IF

03:26:53.267 --> 03:26:54.301
THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T

03:26:54.368 --> 03:26:56.170
DO THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH FINE

03:26:56.237 --> 03:26:59.240
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT IT

03:26:59.306 --> 03:27:00.174
IS THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO. SO

03:27:00.241 --> 03:27:01.976
PARTICULARLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:27:02.042 --> 03:27:03.878
GROUPS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

03:27:03.944 --> 03:27:05.279
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VERY HARD

03:27:05.346 --> 03:27:07.515
LOOK AT THE DEFINITION. OF

03:27:07.581 --> 03:27:10.284
BIODEGRADABLE MY FEELING IS WE

03:27:10.351 --> 03:27:11.652
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THERE

03:27:11.719 --> 03:27:12.853
BECAUSE IN THE END I THINK THE

03:27:12.920 --> 03:27:14.855
END UP IN THE BIOSOLIDS SO IT'S

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:17.424
HARD TO SIT HARD FOR ME TO

03:27:17.491 --> 03:27:18.025
BELIEVE THEY WOULDN'T BY THE

03:27:18.092 --> 03:27:19.593
GREAT BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:21.595
GROUPS. STILL WANT TO TAKE A

03:27:21.662 --> 03:27:23.664
CLOSE LOOK AT THAT BOB BUT- YOU

03:27:23.731 --> 03:27:26.066
KNOW IN THE END I THINK WILL BE

03:27:26.133 --> 03:27:27.434
WITH THE E. U. STANDARDS. SO A

03:27:27.501 --> 03:27:29.303
CLOSE LOOK AT THAT IN THERE IN

03:27:29.370 --> 03:27:31.172
THE PROGRESS OF THIS BILL YEAH

03:27:31.238 --> 03:27:31.772
DURING THE PROGRESS OF THIS

03:27:31.839 --> 03:27:33.340

THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME AND I

03:27:34.708 --> 03:27:36.443
COULD TALK SCIENCE WITH THIS GUY

03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:37.678
OKAY. YEAH THE OTHER QUITE THE

03:27:37.745 --> 03:27:39.280
OTHER COMEDY CAME UP WAS YOU

MASCARA OR WHATEVER THEY JUST

03:27:42.049 --> 03:27:44.118
WEST OF. IF THE E. U. DOESN'T

03:27:44.185 --> 03:27:45.953
REGULATE THEM NEITHER WILL WE

03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:48.556
BUT WE DO WANT TO. ALIGN WITH

03:27:48.622 --> 03:27:52.126
THE YEARS SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW

03:27:52.193 --> 03:27:53.794
WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT GOES. I'LL

03:27:53.861 --> 03:27:54.895
BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY

03:27:54.962 --> 03:27:57.665

03:28:07.041 --> 03:28:11.178
CLOSE YES- ABOUT ANSWERING

03:28:11.245 --> 03:28:13.380
MISTER WHICH QUESTIONS I THINK

03:28:13.447 --> 03:28:15.683
GETS ITS THEIR- THESE LIKELY ARE

03:28:15.749 --> 03:28:18.052
ENDING UP IN THE BIOSOLIDS WHICH

03:28:18.118 --> 03:28:19.453
GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS

03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:22.523
THE STATE. AND YOU KNOW IF THERE

03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:24.825
WERE NO ALTERNATIVE. THAT WOULD

03:28:24.892 --> 03:28:26.760
BE ONE THING BUT THE YEAR WAS

03:28:26.827 --> 03:28:28.062
COMING UP WITH REGULATIONS WHICH

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.964
IN THE LONG RUN I THINK THIS

03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:32.032

WITH WE STILL UNDERSTAND THE

03:28:33.767 --> 03:28:36.837
SCIENCE BETTER- BUT I THINK THAT

03:28:36.904 --> 03:28:38.939
IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO.

03:28:39.006 --> 03:28:40.641
AND THERE'S NO POINT

03:28:40.708 --> 03:28:42.977
DISTRIBUTING PLASTIC. CROSSED
