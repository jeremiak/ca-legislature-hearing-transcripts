WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM THE LAURA STREET HE- PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND LORETTA MEL B. THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER WELCOME. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I AM DIVORCED YOYO AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING. WITH ME TODAY IS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER LORETTA MELBY. WHO SINCE ASSUMING THIS ROLE IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET HEARING HAS LED B. R. N. THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS AND EFFICIENCIES. IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- COLLABORATION WITH THE CA BRN LAUNCH THE APPLICATION STATUS AND DETAILS TOOL ON THE BEER AND WEBSITE. THIS NEW TOOL PROVIDES APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES WITH DETAILED INFORMATION AND THE PROGRESSION OF THEIR INITIAL AND RENEWAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING ANY ITEMS THAT ARE DEFICIENT. TO FURTHER IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE THE B. R. N. ALSO REMOVED THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF A PASSPORT LIKE PHOTO. AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF DUPLICATE TRANSCRIPTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION FOR REPEAT EXAMINATION APPLICATIONS. BOTH OF WHICH HELP TO REDUCE THE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE APPLICATION PROCESS THUS IMPROVING PROCESSING TIME FRAMES ONE TO REDUCE DUPLICATION AND RESTRUCTURE CONTINUING APPROVAL VISITS ALSO KNOWN AS C. EIGHTIES. FOR NURSING PROGRAMS APPEARANCE WHICH IS IMPEDED IN ITS FIRST JOINT C. A. B. WITH THE ACCREDITATION COMMISSION FOR EDUCATION IN NURSING ALSO KNOWN AS A C. E. M. THIS JOINT EFFORT IDENTIFIED SIMILARITIES. BUT CONFIRM THE VAST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND ACCREDITORS PROCESS UTILIZING AN EVALUATION APPROACH AND THE ROLE OF THE REGULATOR WHO SERVES AS CONSULTANT. THE B. R. N. HAS A LINE OF TEACHERS C. EIGHTY. WITH A PREDATION VISITS AND WILL LEVERAGE THE ACCREDITORS REVIEW TO REDUCE DUPLICATION AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY WHERE POSSIBLE. ALSO THIS PAST FALL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CA AND A CONTRACTED IT VENDOR THE BEER AND DEVELOP A NEW SECURE PORTAL AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA APPROVED PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAM. THIS NEW PROCESS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR SUBMISSION OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS. AND EXPEDITES THE CALIFORNIA EXAMINATION APPROVAL PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS STUDENTS TO SCHEDULE THEIR INFLUX SOON- THAN IN THE PAST. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT A GRADUATE TAKES THE INFLUX AFTER COMPLETING A NURSING PROGRAM THE HIGHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFULLY PASSING THE EXAM AND ENTERING THE WORK FORCE I POINT. ADDITIONALLY IN NOVEMBER THE BOARD APPROVED A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS STRATEGIC PLAN IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND INCLUDES OUR NEW MISSION. TO PROTECT THE HEALTH. FIFTY AND WELL BEING OF THE PUBLIC. THROUGH THE FAIR AND CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING NURSING PRACTICES AND EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY OUR MOST RECENT EFFICIENCY HEARD THIS MONTH WHEN IN COLLABORATION WITH N. C. S. B. N. B. R. N. IMPLEMENTED MERCIES. TO PROVIDE THE LICENSE VERIFICATION SERVICE FOR OUR ENDS LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS ALIGNS THE B. R. AND WITH OTHER STATES AND TERRITORIES USING NURSES FOR THEIR LICENSE VERIFICATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THIS JOINT COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. AS YOU CAN SEE THE BOARD HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS. AND EFFICIENCIES OVER THIS PAST YEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD A FOUNDATION THAT WILL BE SUSTAINABLE AND NIMBLE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. THANKS AGAIN AND LORETTA AND I ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE MISS MOBLIE ANY ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. NOW I THINK SHE SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY THANK YOU. OKAY- BERMAN ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU TEAR FF I'M HAPPY THAT- LIKE COLLEAGUES- GO FIRST AND I'LL SEE IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WANT TO EVER GET THE CHANCE RICHARD THANK YOU A SEMI MEMBER OR ONE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ROTH SO DURING COVERT WE SAW A MAN. AT LEAST REGIONALLY NURSING SHORTAGES AND I THINK ONE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS TO GETTING. THE NURSES OUT INTO PRACTICE IS- THE LACK OF CLINICAL SLOTS AND SO- PRIOR TO A. B. A TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. I WAS WHICH I WAS A CO AUTHOR OF. OF BEER AND REGULATIONS ONLY ALLOWED. A NURSING SCHOOLS TO UTILIZE 25% OF- CLINICAL SIMULATION AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR- FOR CLINICAL HOURS SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS THE CASE AND- ARE YOU TAKING STEPS TO CONSIDER MOVING UP TO. A 50% LIKE MANY OTHER STATES THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS- LORENA FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN- WE ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ACTUALLY STARTED WITH READING LOOKING AT OUR REGULATION BACK REGULATION IN ALIGNMENT- FIGHT SELF IS NOT AFFECTED AND- I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT REGULATION WHICH IS FOURTEEN SIXTY THREE SIXTEEN C. C. R. FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX STARTED WITH A NURSE RIGHT HERE AT THE BEGINNING BUT ALL WORK THROUGH THOSE- IT SAYS THAT YOU NEED EIGHTEEN SEMESTER UNITS IN NURSING CLINICAL- AND THEN THOSE SEMESTER UNITS ARE BASED ON THE WEEK AND SO THERE'S NOT A STANDARD OUR NUMBER SO SOME SCHOOLS CHOOSE THREE OUT OF THREE UNIX IN PEDIATRICS SO 50% OF THAT WOULD BE A GOOD AND A HALF SOME SCHOOLS HAVE UNIT HAPPEN PEDIATRICS AND STUPID YOU PERCENT OF THAT WOULD BE A POINT SEVEN FIVE CREDIT. SO WE DON'T HAVE A BASELINE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE END C-SPAN SIMULATION STUDY THAT WE'VE THEY'VE BEEN KIND OF PUSHING OUT FOR PROBABLY TEN YEARS NOW THE FIRST THING IT SAYS IS TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT PATIENT CARE CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS THAT'S WHAT OUR BOARD VOTED IN NOVEMBER TO DO SO IN NOVEMBER IN. A BOARD MEETING I EXPLAINED. IS THAT WE HAVE WITH. WITH THAT MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SCHOOLS TO DO AS MUCH SIMULATION AS THEY CAN SUPPORT. IF THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT IT IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE FACULTY TO TEACH IT. THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO AS MUCH STIMULATION AS THEY WANT AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS STATES LIKE WASHINGTON OREGON AND WASHINGTON. AND OTHERS WERE THEY HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM A SIMULATION PERCENTAGE AND LAUGHTER THAT TO THEIR DEANS AND DIRECTORS TO ESTABLISH WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THEY SERVE. AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE SO CALIFORNIA. UNTIL WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING IN THEIR STATUTE REGARDING SIMULATION OR EVEN IN THE REGULATIONS REGARDING SIMULATION. WE HAD NEVER HAD ANY AUTHORITY OVER THAT- WE ONLY HAD A BIRDIE THAT TALK TO THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE THAT PROCESS WE WILL SET A STANDARD DRINK. MINIMUM POWER REQUIREMENTS THIS YEAR IN REGULATION UNLESS YOU GUYS WANT TO ADD THAT AS PART OF OUR SUNSET BILL- AND WE WILL FOLLOW THAT AND ALLOW OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS TO HAVE CARTE BLANCHE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH STIMULATION. WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT AND WAS LONG AS A SERVICE TO DEMOGRAPHIC THE CABBIE OUGHT TO THAT IS WE DO APPROVE THE CURRICULUM. SO WE DO KNOW WHAT THE CLINICAL OBJECTIVES ARE IN PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT IS TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER THEY DO OUTSIDE OF THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE. MANAGES TO PREPARE THOSE STUDENTS TO BE SAFE AND COMPETENT NURSES AFTER GRADUATION AND. MEETS THOSE CLINICAL PROJECT. OKAY YOU THAT SIR. SO WITH THE MINIMUM AND- DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS- THAT YOUR THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT- THIS YEAR DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF SIMULATION AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WE'VE- WE'VE- LOOKED AT DATA. AND THAT THERE IS. A CLINICAL SIMULATION HAS COME A REALLY LONG WAY AND IT SHOWED THE DATA SHOWS THAT IT INCREASES CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION MAKING. AND AIDS IN A CROSS CULTURAL CARE SO DO YOU SEE IT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME WHEN YOU SAY WE'VE TO SET OUR SETTING A MINIMUM STANDARD FOR DIRECT PATIENT CARE. DOES THAT MEAN DO YOU SEE. A AN INCREASE IN SIMULATION. I MEAN IS THAT ALL THE CABBIE OUTS THAT YOU HAVE PUT FORWARD. YEAH THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT DO SIMULATION REALLY WELL THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE THE STAFF THEY HAVE THE FACILITIES THEY HAVE ACCESS TO EVERYTHING THOSE SCHOOLS WILL INCREASE IN SIMULATION BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THIS DOES WHICH IS KIND OF AN INTENSIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT A CONSEQUENCE AT ALL. IS BECAUSE IT ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND THE SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE LIKE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES WE USED IS WE HAD A SCHOOL THAT HAD TWENTY FOUR UNITS THAT THEY WANTED TO USE IN CLINIC- SINCE THE EIGHTEEN UNITS THAT WERE REQUIRED. WHAT SIX ADDITIONAL UNITS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BUT EACH ONE OF THEIR STUDENTS NEEDED TO OBTAIN IN ORDER TO GRADUATE THAT MEANT A LARGER STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THAT MEANT MORE CLINICAL IN ACTION. SO WHEN WE SET THIS MINIMUM STANDARD IT'S BEEN A WHOLE STUDENTS OUT OF THAT COMMUNITY DECREASE THE CLINICAL IMPACTION AND ALLOW FOR SCHOOLS TO HAVE AS MUCH CLINICAL- STIMULATION THAT THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE. YOUR REGARDLESS OF THE B. R. N. SO THAT THEY CAN EIGHTEEN FACULTY LOADS THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR SIMULATION THAT WILL BE UP TO THEM BECAUSE THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIMULATIONS WE HAVE SOME. THAT ARE COMPUTERIZED HIM THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HIGH FIDELITY STEM SUMMER EVEN DOING VIRTUAL REALITY SO AS LONG AS THEY MEET THE GRADUATE OUTCOMES IN THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES I THINK OUR PROGRAMS WERE ABSOLUTELY STEP UP AND USE THAT AND IT WILL ACTUALLY WORK TO. EFFECTIVELY DECREASING CLINICAL IMPACTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT- HI WHEN I WAS IN MY DOCTOR'S PREPAY ONLY COMPLETED ONE YEAR HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET ONE OF MY ORIGINAL- POINTS OF LOOKING AT WAS SIMULATION AND I ACTUALLY SERVED- UNDER KT WAXMAN IN BY JUST GOING TO ALL OF OUR CLASSES HE WAS. REALLY ON THE FOREFRONT OF DEVELOPING SIMULATION SO I HAVE A HUGE TRUST OF SIMULATION AND I. TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT IS A GREAT ADS TO THE PATIENT. SO WE ARE NEED KIND OF STAY THERE THEIR OWN BROWN WE SET THE SCENE FOR MEN DIRECT. CARE AND LET THE SCHOOLS WITH THEIR DEANS AND DIRECTORS PARTNERING WITH THEIR SIMULATION EXPERTS DEVELOP WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU AND THEN- ONE OTHER THING ON THE NOTE OF FLEXIBILITY RIGHT. B. R. AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE CONCURRENCE BETWEEN- THEORY AND CLINICALS. AND HAS THERE BEEN SOME THOUGHT ABOUT ALLOWING- THE THEORY TO BE TAKEN FIRST BEFORE YOU DO CLINICALS JUST. SO YOU DON'T DEAL WITH- BOTTLENECKS IN- AND- PUTTING PATIENTS OUT ART OR A PUTTING IT AHEAD. MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM I SHOULD SAY A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THOUGH SO THE FIRST ONE IS THEY HAVE COMPLETE AUTONOMY WITHIN THEIR CURRENT SEMESTER RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT CLINICAL INFERI SCHEDULING. SO IF THEY HAVE A SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER AND THEY WANT TO FOCUS THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS ON THIRD. AND THEN GO THE FINAL EIGHT WEEKS INTO SIMULATION THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTABLE CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR REGULATIONS AND SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY DO A TWO DAY INTENSIVE BOOT CAMP THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS OF THE SEMESTER AND THEN THEY GO INTO CLINICALS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT AND ROTATE PEOPLE THROUGH ON A GROUP LIKE BASIS. WE ARE IN COMPLETE SUPPORT WITH THAT SO THAT FLEXIBILITY IS THERE AND IS ENCOURAGED WE ALSO HAVE- A KEY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WE AND RICHER AND HE SEES THAT WORK WITH THESE PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY AND IF THEY DO COME ACROSS A TIME WHERE THEY SAY HEY I HAVE FIVE STUDENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FINISH THEIR CLINICALS WITHIN THE SEMESTER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM TO WRAP THAT UP THE NEC'S WORK WITH THEM THE PROGRAM GIVES THEM AN INCOMPLETE THAT ALLOW SOME FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL DAYS POST THIS SEMESTER TO CLEAR UP THOSE HOURS THEY CLEAR THOSE HOURS AFTER THEY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SEMESTER. THE THING IS THE OLD. WHICH TO ME. THOSE HOURS INTO THE NEXT THE MASTER THAT I TALKED ABOUT IN OUR SENSE OF HEARING NUMBER TWO LAST YEAR IN MAY. THAT IS TRULY AN ALLERGY I USED AT THAT POINT THE BAD PAID A MONTH BECAUSE YOU HAVE CLINICAL HOURS YOU HAVE TO BE IN THAT NEXT SEMESTER. SO YOU END UP BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL GOING INTO THAT NEXT SEMESTER. INUNDATING THE CLINICAL SITES THAT YOU'RE ALREADY USING FOR THAT NEXT SEMESTER TO SCHEDULE YOUR CLINICALS ARE NEEDED BAD. AND JUST LIKE TRYING TO MAKE UP THE REMAINING CLINICAL HOURS FROM THE SEMESTER BEFORE. THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO COMPLETE. SO THAT FROM A SCHEDULING BASIS AND IT IMPACTED THE COMMUNITY IS REALLY NOT AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS TO WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE TO DO THEORY AND CLINICAL CONCURRENT WHEN YOU'RE I THE CLASSROOM AND YOU'RE TEACHING A SUBJECT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- HOLD PERSON STEPPED AWAY ARE YOU TALK ABOUT- TWO TROLLEY OF HELLO AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THAT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING OR PRACTICE THAT IN A SIMULATION- YOU KIND YOU KIND OF LOSE IT AND SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT THEORY WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON GO TO THE CLINICAL SETTING. LET YOUR CLINICAL PARTNER SAY HEY MY STUDENTS ARE LEARNING ABOUT CARDIAC RIGHT NOW CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY CARDIAC PATIENTS WE WANT OBSERVE WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY SEE THINGS IN REAL LIFE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT BIG OUR EXPERIENCE THAT THEY BRING THOSE QUESTIONS BACK TO THE THEORY INSTRUCT THE NEXT WEEK AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I SAW ON CLINICAL THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD IN THEORY MAKE HAT MAKES SENSE FOR ME AND THEY USE THAT ON A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP FOR FEEDBACK AND SO IT IS IMPERATIVE. THAT THEY HAVE THOSE REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE THIS CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS IT'S REALLY TO AID AND THEN BEING ABLE TO LEARN THAT CONTACT CONTACT SEE IT IN ACTION BRING QUESTIONS BACK AND REALLY HAVE THAT EMBEDDED IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEIR NOT HAVING TO GUESS WHEN THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF A PATIENT LATER ON THAT THEY MIGHT NOT. HAVE SEEN IT EXPOSED TO. SO I GUESS I'D HAVE ONE WAY QUESTION ALONG THOSE HAVE YOU SEEN DATA THAT IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE TO DO THAT WAY. TO DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER HEALING ARTS LIKE A MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY WHICH REQUIRE- THE THEORY BE TAUGHT. BEFORE THE CLINICAL. YEAH THERE IS DATA THAT THERE IS THERE'S- THERE'S- A LOT OF DATA RIGHT BEFORE- THE COLD OUTBREAK THAT REALLY KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THE THEORY PRACTICE GAP AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW EDUCATION AKADEMI ARE PREPARING THE STUDENTS FOR PRACTICE YET WHEN THE PRACTICE SETTING REACHES THEM OUR HIRES THEM THEY'RE NOT READY. AND SO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT- INCREASINGNEW GRAD PROGRAMS WAY BACK WAY WAY BACK WHEN I BECAME A NURSE TWENTY SOME YEARS AGO WE WERE DOING SIX WEEK- NEW GRAD PROGRAMS. BAND WHEN I WAS A CLINICAL EDUCATOR AT THE BEDSIDE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THE SIX MONTHS ENDING MAYBE EVEN A YEAR TO REALLY GET OUR NURSES SUPPORTED BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH TO JUST STICKS OUT THERE. THAT TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ACCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE OF NURSES ENTER PRACTICE WITHIN TWO YEARS SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HIGH POINT OF NURSES. IT'S MORE THAN JUST PUTTING THEM THROUGH SCHOOL AND GETTING THEM TO PASS THE AND PLAQUES IT'S PUTTING THEM THROUGH SCHOOL GETTING THE PASS AND PLAQUE. AND COLLECTS MAKING SURE THEY'RE SUPPORTED SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD YOU DECIDE TO STAY IN NURSING. THEY DECIDED TO STAY AND TAKE CARE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY WERE PREPARED TO DO THE WORST JUST SERVICE THAT WE DO IS PREPARE THESE STUDENTS IN ADEQUATELY. PUT THEM INTO THE WORK FORCE DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND WITH THEIR JOB ASPIRATION IS BAD WITH THEIR LIFE GOALS BAND FOR ALL OF THEIR YEARS THEY DECIDEYOU KNOW WHAT NO THIS IS NOT RIGHT FOR ME. AND THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SO YEAH THERE'S ABSOLUTELY EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT TIS WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IT STARTED WAY WAY WAY BACK WHEN WE WERE DOING DIPLOMA PROGRAMS AND THEY WOULD GO TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING. AND THEY WOULD GO INTO THE CLINICAL PRACTICE THAT EVENING AND BY THE TIME THEY GRADUATED SCHOOL THEY WERE RUNNING THE NURSING FLOOR BECAUSE THEY WERE EACH SEEING EVERYTHING PARTICIPATING IN EVERYTHING. IN THE NURSING STUDENTS KNOW THAT WITHIN THAT FIRST YEAR THEY'RE DOING A TON OF ON THE JOB TRAINING BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY NEEDED TO SEE IT IN PRACTICE. THEY NEEDED TO BE HANDS ON THEY NEEDED TO TOUCH THE PATIENT THEY NEED TO DISPEL PATIENTS SEE THE PATIENT WATCH THE BLANKS BE ABLE TO USE. ALL OF THEIR ASSESSMENT ABILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. IRWIN MAYBE I COULD JUST- ASK CLARIFY QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO. THE DOCTOR PAN EXCELLENT QUESTIONS- MA'AM YOU USE THE NUMBER- OR THE PHRASE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE WHAT IS THE NUMBER THAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE A NEW ACTIVITY WE DID IT RELYING ON THEM THIS LAST NOVEMBER AND THEY'RE PLANNING ON HAVING THEIR FIRST MEETING THIS APRIL TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT DATA. BUT OREGON AT WASHINGTON DC THEY'RE GIVING US A RANGE FROM AND C-SPAN THEY SAID ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND ONE TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY WE LOOKED AT HAWAII'S DATA HAWAII STATUS AS ONE THOUSAND- HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SIMULATION REPORT THAT NCS. PUT OUT BASS SAID MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE OF SIX HUNDRED. AND SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ST BERNARD'S STATUS. A SIMULATION STUDY THAT THEY'D STARTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN REACT AGAIN IN TWENTY NINETEEN THEY'RE RECOMMENDING SIX HUNDRED HOURS AS B. DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT IS AFFECTED YOU 550% UP. SO WE CAN LOOK ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED INDIAN ALIGNMENT WITH ALL THE OTHER WORDS VERSES THAT ARE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION. AND WHAT DOES WHAT DOES THAT REPRESENT IN TERMS OF THE TYPE. OF ISSUE OR TWO ABOUT HOURS RIGHT. YEAH WE ARE TALK ABOUT OURS AND I HE IS AN EXAM. CURRENT CURRENTLY WHEN WE DO 75% IF IT'S AN EIGHTEEN UNIT THE MASTER PORTAL CLINICALS AND IT LASTS FOR EIGHTY SIXTEEN WEEKS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THE BACK CALCULATION THAT'S IN OUR REGULATIONS AND I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A PROBLEM- BASED ON THE WEEKS OF THE SEMESTER SO IF YOU HAVE AN- EIGHTEEN WEEK SEMESTER. YOU HAVE MORE HOURS AND SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER YOU HAVE LESS HOURS AND SO BASED ON AN EIGHTEEN YEAR NEXT SEMESTER CALCULATION BACK IS SIXTEEN WEEKS WHICH IS THE TYPICAL BILL THAT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND THAT'S WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. WE THEN IT GOES LOWER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST NURSING COURSE THAT IS TEACHING BASIC SKILLS WE ALLOW 1100% TO BE DONE IN A SIMULATION LAB. SO WE'RE RIGHT THERE- AND I THINK THAT WE CAN MOVE THAT. THAT EASILY SAID BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED BASED ON THE DATA AND I EXPECT THAT I CAN EITHER PULL THAT FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT GETTING THAT INTO THE SUNSET REPORT WHICH I WOULD SUPPORT GREATLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD. ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY BURST IS GOING TO READ TO YOUR PROCESS TO UPDATE OUR REGULATIONS WHICH WE WOULD GET TO BUT IT WOULD HAVE A DELAYED EFFECT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN HOLD A- EVIDENCE FOR AND GIVE THAT TO YOU AND PROVIDE THAT TO YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. WELL I'M JUST WHEN YOU SAY SCHOOLS ARE FREE TO DO AS MUCH CLINICAL. SIMULATION AS THEY- C. FIT TO DO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. THE VAL OF THAT DEPENDS ON. WHAT PERCENTAGE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE IS OF THE TOTAL HOURS IN THE PROGRAM SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SIX HUNDRED HOURS WHAT PERCENTAGE. DOES THAT REPRESENT OF THE TOTAL TEACHING HOURS IN THE NURSING PROGRAM. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION IF. IS ALL RIGHT WELL LET ME LET ME JUST SO IS IT SIX HUNDRED HOURS OUT OF A THOUSAND WHICH ALLOWS THE TRAINING PROGRAM TO. UTILIZE CLINICAL SIMULATION FOR FOUR HUNDRED HOURS IS IT SIX HUNDRED HOURS YEAH. SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS FOR ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF CLINICAL SIMULATION I WAS TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND- YOU REMEMBER YOUR DATE DEALING WITH THE GERIATRIC SET WHEN YOU DEAL WITH ME SO. WELL THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I'M TRAINED IN GERIATRICS AS WELL SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS. SO CENTER OUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WHAT THE NCS AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING STUDY SHOWS IS SIX HUNDRED IS THAT DIRECT PATIENT CARE ANYTHING TO FIFTY PERCENT. AND STILL BE EVIDENCE SAYS THE MINIMUM STANDARD WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED HOURS AND THEN PROGRAMS CAN DO IT. JUST NOT THREE HUNDRED ON TOP OF THAT. AND THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATELY PREPARED NURSING STUDENT FOUR B. THE FIELD. SO FOR THAT I SHOW THAT 50% CAN BE MAYBE CLINICAL SIMULATION IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT. IT COULD BE SIMULATION BUT REMEMBER OUR REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW ONLY SPEAK TO THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE IT SAYS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST COURSE THAT CAN BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. THE REMAINING COURSES MUST HAVE MISSED MUCH IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT ALLOWS THE SCHOOL TO DO OBSERVATION. CASE STUDIES- VOLUNTEER WORK AND ADD TO IT INCLUDING SIMULATION IF THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO DO THAT. TO REALLY HAVE THOSE STUDENTS BE ABLE TO MEET. EIGHT CLINICAL OUTCOMES SO PULLING AWAY FROM A PERCENTAGE IS REALLY THE- THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IN THE WAY THAT OUR BOARD VOTED. TO GO AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THIS LAST YEAR IS TO ESTABLISH THAT DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND STAY SILENT LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE. ON HOW THEY MEET THE REST OF THE CLINICAL OBJECTIVES WITH THE ABILITY THAT THEY HAVE THAT IS SCHOOL SPECIFIC. AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS YOU'VE HEARD THE FIGHT 450% FIFTY PERCENT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY RESEARCH DATA RESEARCH DRIVEN DATA. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BASELINE BEFORE YOU CAN GO 250% YET THE BASELINE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IS NEVER ESTABLISH A BASELINE. SO WE NEED TO U. S. STOCK THAT BASELINE AND THEN OUR SCHOOL CAN THEIR- IS RUN. IT FIFTY SO PRE LIFE NURSING FROM THAT WE A- THROUGHOUT THE STATE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THE SERVER AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER THIS IS THEIR SCHOOL WELL YOU KNOW. WE'LL GET TO THAT I'M SURE LATER. LET ME- I'LL LEAVE THE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THE- SIMULATION TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE ON THE FLOOR WHO IS CERTAINLY MORE MORE EXPERIENCED IN THE CLINICAL SIDE THAN I AM LET ME MOVE QUICKLY TO ONE CLARIFYING. QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT OF CONCURRENCY THEORY VERSUS CLINICAL. AND I UNDERSTAND THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING CONCURRENT I THINK I DO THEORY AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THE SHOULD THE PROGRAM SO TO SPEAK ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL. SITUATIONS AND I WAS TAKEN IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER- WITH THE COMMENT. FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S STILL MY UNDERSTANDING LARGEST. THAT CASE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE US. AND THE COMMENT POINTED OUT. WHAT MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN NOTED THAT IN THE CASE OF PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND- PHYSICIANS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH PROGRAM DO NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED EVERY INSTANCE CONCURRENCY. AND THE QUOTE IN THE BACKGROUND REPORT IS FLEXIBILITY IN THE REQUIREMENT COULD ALLOW PROGRAMS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF AVAILABLE PLACEMENTS BY FRONT LOADING THEORY CONTENT AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WITH CORRESPONDING CLINICAL. PRACTICUM AND MY QUESTION IS SHOULDN'T WE- CONTINUE TO EXPAND FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AREA GIVEN THE- EVER INCREASING NEED FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR- EXPANSION OF CLINICAL FACILITIES AND TRAINING SLOTS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO KEEP UP. WHETHER BECAUSE OF ECONOMICS- BECAUSE FRANKLY OF. THE CHANGING WAY WE DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M TRYING TO COME OFF MUTE HERE MYSELF THANK YOU- SO A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE KIND OF HAVE TO LOOK AT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK ONE D. AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS YOU LOOK AT THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS THEY HAVE A ONE YEAR INTERNSHIP AND EXPRESSED. EXTERNSHIP INTERNSHIP SORRY AND A RESIDENCY AFTER THEIR COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM WHERE THEY ARE AT THE FACILITY THAT THEY'RE DOING TRAINING. AND THERE WE HAVE A MENTOR THERE ARE SIGNS YOU AT PHYSICIAN NETWORKS WITH THEM THE ENTIRE TIME AS- A ONE YEAR FIRST YEAR RESIDENCY IS SECOND YEAR RESIDENCY THEY DO THIS AS AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THE CORE PART OF THEIR CURRICULUM. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT NURSING EDUCATION IS SET UP WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHEN NURSES GRADUATE THEY GO INTO A TRANSITION PROGRAM LIKE I SAID WAS ABOUT SIX WEEKS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT'S ON OUR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW. THEY WHEN COLEMAN HIT AND THEY LOST THEIR EDUCATORS THE BOULDER EDUCATORS IN THE STAFF THOSE EDUCATORS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR- NEW GRADUATE PROGRAMS. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THERE TO SERVE THEM ANYMORE IT'S SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN INNATE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE NURSING EDUCATION BUT THEY'RE NOT SET UP TO BE SIMILAR. NOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE NURSING PROGRAMS IF WE DROP BACK TO A DIRECT PATIENT CARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WHAT HAPPENS IS IT MAKES IT LESS HOURS THAT HAVE TO BE COMPLETE COMPLETED ON A SEMESTER BASIS. SO BAD EVEN AFFECTS THAT SCHEDULING FIASCO BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF HOURS TO DO ON A SEMESTER SEMESTER BASIS WHICH THEN DOESN'T REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PULL THEM INTO NEXT SEMESTER BECAUSE. IN FACT WE DECREASED THAT. WOULD THEN ACTS IF. AT ADDRESS. THE CLINICAL IMPACT ATTACKING THAT AREA SO IF WE- THREE. OF A CLINICAL. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR HOURS BAG IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER. IN ORDER FOR THAT STUDENT TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHAT THEIR CURRENT REGULATIONS RIGHT BUT SEE WE HAVE A SCHOOL THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THREE THREE UNITS IS GOOD BUT I THINK I SHOULD DO FOUR AND A HALF UNITS. WELL WHEN THEY DECIDE THAT APPARENTLY AND DO THAT ON THEIR OWN THEY NOW ARE REQUIRING THEIR STUDENTS WITH OUR B. R. AND DIRECTION THE COMPLETE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN HOURS IN A CLINICAL SETTING WHICH AND THAT'S SEVENTY TWO MORE HOURS IN THE BORDERS REQUIRING. SO IF WE SET A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONCURRENCY FLEXIBILITY TO GO INTO THE NEXT SEMESTER ND THEY'RE NOT INTO IT IT'S BEEN STACKING THE DECK AGAINST THEM BECAUSE IF YOU CARRY OVER SEVENTY TWO HOURS FROM THE NEXT FROM THE PREVIOUS SEMESTER OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. THAT NEEDED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT SEMESTER ANYWAY ADD THAT ON TOP OF THEIR. HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR HOURS. WELL NOW YOU HAVE TO ENTER SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN AND THAT'S- WHAT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THE NEXT SEMESTER GONNA DUMP IN PROBABLY EIGHTY SIX MORE HOURS INTO THAT SEMESTER AND COMPILE THAT ON TO THE NEXT ONE. SO I UNDERSTAND THEIR NEED I TRULY DO I WAS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR YEARS I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME SCHEDULING MY STUDENTS I WAS EVEN THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT COORDINATOR CAUGHT MY SCHOOL BEFORE IT BECAME THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR. CLINICALS ARE HARD AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOLVING THIS A DIFFERENT ROUTE AND THAT IS WHERE WE STAB US IN MINIMUM. DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS WE ALREADY HAVE THAT IN OUR REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW IN SIXTEEN C. C. R. FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. THAT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS THAT SAY YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE. FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF SUPERVISED DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND THEN OUR NURSE PRACTITIONER PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO DO STANDARDIZED PATIENTS OR ABOVE. WHAT AND SIMULATIONS OVER TO BOB WHAT OUR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT IS TO PREPARE THEIR STUDENTS THIS PUTS US INTO A LINE MET WITH THOSE NATIONAL STANDARDS BEING ABLE TO DO THAT SIMILARLY TO WHAT WE ALREADY DO FOR AND KEEP PROGRAMS. SO IT TRULY ADDRESSES ALL OF THOSE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP AS A CONCERN BECAUSE THOSE ARE CONCERNS AS WELL. WELL LISTEN THE CHANGES THAT THE BOARD IS PUT IN PLACE MAY VERY WELL DEAL WITH THIS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE TO DROP OUT OF NURSING PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENT. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER SO. THE QUESTION IS DOES THE BOARD MONITOR THE NUMBER OF DRUG PROGRAM DROPOUTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONCURRENCY. REQUIREMENTS WHICH I HOPE THE ANSWER IS YES. AND IF IT NOT I HOPE YOU WILL BE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE HELLO AND SEE THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGES THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE. ON THE ISSUES THAT THE SCHOOLS SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THOSE THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS. APPARENTLY INCLUDING. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SO. SOMEBODY SEES A PROBLEM I'M HOPING THAT YOUR CHANGES HAVE ADDRESSED IT BUT IF NOT I'D LIKE SOME STATISTICS SO WE KNOW. THE SCOPE OF THE REMAINING PRO PRO- PROBLEM. THE NEXT TIME WE GATHER AT THE RIVER TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. DELAY LOVE THAT IDEA DO YOU KEEP STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMMATIC DROPOUTS THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF THE- CONCERT CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER ATTRITION. RATES AT ALL- WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING AID ASK US TO MONITOR ATTRITION WE DO AND IT IS SHARED ON OUR BOARD'S WEBSITE WHAT THAT IS. THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE DO THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN TITLE FOR FUNDING WHICH IS THE NATIONAL LEVELS THEY DO TIME AND A HALF FOR COMPLETION SO GIVE IT TO YOUR PROGRAM. THEIR TUITION NUMBERS FOR FUNDING IS BASED ON A TIME AND A HALF SO THEY ALLOW FOR THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE IT. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING GOES ABOVE THAT AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TRACK ON TIME COMPLETION SO IF YOU HAVE A TWO YEAR PROGRAM. WE WANT TO NOTE THAT STUDENT ABYAN SEE SIGNED UP HERE THEY COMPLETED TWO YEARS LATER ATTRITION NUMBER YES. WE COLLECTED THAT DATA. IT IS ON OUR- IN ORDER TO GET DATA THAT SAYS WHY. DOES SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE TO DO AN EXIT INTERVIEW WITH EACH ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS. TO FIND OUT WHY THE TRULY DROPPED OUT WHEN. I CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE CASE BECAUSE YOU HAVE. CLINICAL PLACEMENT MONITORS IN NURSING SCHOOLS AND BECAUSE OF THE CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS. THOSE PLACEMENT DIRECTORS WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT AVAILABLE. AND WHETHER THE STUDENT CAN. PARTICIPATE IN A CLINICAL SLOT. CONCURRENT WITH THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND IF THE STUDENT CAN'T THEN THE STUDENT. CAN'T COMPLETE THAT COURSE SO THERE MUST BE DATA. SOMEWHERE HE ASKED. CAN AND I HEAR YOU ON THAT I YOU ON AND I WOULD LOVE TO SAY ABSOLUTELY YES IT IS TRULY JUST BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROGRESS. BAD DATA WAS ONLY AVAILABLE DURING KOBE. WE'RE NOW NOT IN THE MIDST OF KOBE HAT DATA WAS NOT COLLECTED BEFORE BY THE PROGRAMS IT WAS NOT REPORTED. WE DO HAVE SOME DATA WITHIN OUR OUR- UCSF CONTRACT REPORT AND IF THEY DO SAY THAT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TIME GETTING CLINICAL SPACES. THEY ALSO HAVE THE SAME DATA THAT SAYS EVEN WITH THE 25% THAT THEY CAN USE IN SIMULATION. THEY'RE NOT USING IT THEY'RE USING 15% ARE USING 18% SO IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ISSUE THAN JUST A CUT AND DRY ANSWER. SO IF A STUDENT IS NOT ABLE TO PROGRESS SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR CLINICAL REASONS THEN THAT IS DATA THAT THE SCHOOL HOUSE TO TELLER AND HE SEES. AND WHEN THEY COME INTO ANY ISSUE LIKE THAT PRIOR TO KOBE THEY REACHED OUT TO THE NEC'S THE NEC'S MADE A PLAN WITH THEM AND THEY GOT THEM TO CONTINUE. WHAT TYPICALLY WE SEE IS THAT IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE IT'S- MONETARY HARDSHIP- IT'S- PREGNANCY YOU'RE A MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE- THERE SOME OTHER REASON THAT REQUIRES STUDENTS NOT TO CONTINUE. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET SCHEDULE OUR DIRECTORS ARE AMAZINGLY AND THAT. AND THEY WILL FIND PLACEMENTS THEY CALL UP THEIR FRIENDS THEY CALL US WE START LOOKING FOR THEM REACHING OUT TO AREA HOSPITALS AREA CLINICS AND SAYING HEY. CAN YOU GET THE STUDENT AND THEY HAVE TWELVE HOURS LEFT TO DO. BUT THAT AGAIN IS IMPORTANT TO US AND THAT'S WHY WE STARTED LOOKING AT THESE AND I BROUGHT IT FORWARD TO OUR BOARD IN NOVEMBER. WAS DAMAGED IN MINIMUM PRACTICE YOU CARE BECAUSE IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT STUDENT HAS TO BE IN A CLINICAL OVER AND ABOVE. WHAT WE REQUIRE WHEN WE HAVE A OVER IN THAT SAYS. I WANT TO GO ABOVE TO BE IS FOR. A REQUIRED FOUR. IN A- CLINICAL SETTING AND WE WERE ONLY REQUIRED EIGHTEEN WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHTEEN UNITS WHICH IS OUR MINIMUM STANDARD TODAY AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR HOURS. WHEN THE SCHOOL SAYS I THINK TWENTY FOUR UNITS IS BETTER THAT'S ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HOURS SO IF WE DO A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE THEY CAN KEEP THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HOURS THAT THEY THINK IS BETTER. BUT THAT MEANS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED AND THAT IF THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR UNITS IS IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE OR FIVE HUNDRED THAT'D BE IT EIGHTEEN UNITS IS IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE. AND THAT ALLOWS FOR ALL OF THOSE ADDITIONAL UNITS THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SAYS I THINK IS BETTER. CAN BE DONE IN A CERTAIN WAY. AND BACKED. YOU RAISE. ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND CONCURRENCY ISSUE THAT CLINICAL IMPACTION ISSUE. AND TRULY. PUTS LESS OF A BURDEN ON THE COMMUNITY IN THE AREA SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD SO IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGES YOU PUT IN PLACE OF. ELIMINATED THE ISSUE OR PERHAPS I JUST MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING TO US ABOUT- DURING LAST YEAR'S OF SUNSET HEARING BUT IN ANY EVENT IF IT NO LONGER REMAINS A PROBLEM THEN. IT NO LONGER REMAINS A PROBLEM AND- YOU CAN. TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR NEW PROGRAM THE NEXT TIME AS I SAID WE GATHER AT THE RIVER TO HAVE ONE OF THESE. A SUNSET CONVERSATIONS- I DIDN'T MEAN TO DOMINATE THAT SERIES OF QUESTIONS DR PANDA APOLOGIZE TO YOU PLEASE PROCEED. WELL THE THANK YOU THIS THAT. THAT'S A FASCINATING CONVERSATION I'VE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR. AND ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BOARD- AND. IN MEDICAL EDUCATION SO. THE THESE ARE ISSUES THERE IS WITH X. WELL MAYBE I'LL JUST- FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THAT AND THEN I HAD SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ACTUALLY WANT TO ASK AS WELL- SO. BECAUSE THE B. R. AND DOES HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER- ESSENTIALLY NURSING EDUCATION PROGRAMS INCLUDING NURSING TRAINING WITH- CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO ME DO YOU. WELL SO DO YOU REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY SHOOT SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE CLINICAL TRAINING SLOT THE NEEDS SO I KNOW MEDICAL EDUCATION YOU CAN'T GET A CREDIT IS UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE CLINICAL SLOTS LINED UP IN ADVANCE YOU CAN'T HAVE STUDENTS NOT HAVE CLINICAL SLOTS THAT YOU DON'T GO HUNTING AROUND FOR THEM AFTER THEY SIGN UP YOU HAVE TO ALREADY HAVE THE GRIEVANCE IN PLACE THE EMMA USE AND SO FORTH. IS THAT DIFFERENT NURSING I MEAN SO WE CAN START A NURSING SCHOOL AND THEN DIED NOT PEOPLE BUT I GUESS- NOT BE ASSURED THEY HAVE THE CLINICAL SLOTS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION THE SCHOOL HAS A RATE RANGE FOR THAT IN ADVANCE. SO ALL OF US AN EXAMPLE WHAT HAPPENED WITH KOBE. WE HAVE AS THE BEER AND WE HAVEN'T ALREADY OVER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF YOUR- OVER OUR HEALTH. FACILITIES SO THEY WILL HAVE CONTRACTS IN PLACE MOST OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE SEVERAL CONTRACTS IN PLACE. FOR MALL RIGHT. AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEY'RE REMOVED FROM THAT CLINICAL SITE JUST LIKE THEY HAPPEN WITH COLEMAN OKAY SOMETHING HAPPENED. THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THAT SITE. AND SO IF THE JOINT COMMISSION COMES THROUGH THEY'LL CALL UP THE SCHOOL EIGHT I CAN'T HAVE STUDENTS THIS WEEK. AND OR THEY'LL SAY- WERE REMODELING. THAT MAKE LABOR AND DELIVERY UNIT WE CAN'T HAVE STUDENTS IN PLACE WILL HAVE AN EIGHT MONTH PROJECT. AND WE'LL HAVE YOU GUYS BACK NEXT YEAR AFTER EIGHT MONTHS AND SO THERE WILL BE A SEMESTER. THAT THERE THAT CLINICAL FACILITY THAT THEY USED TO USE IS NOW NOT THERE OKAY BUT STILL. WE DO- ADEQUATELY CLINICAL RESEARCH CLINICAL ADEQUATE CLINICAL FACILITIES. FOR EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS. BUT WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE OKAY. TIRED TIME. EIGHT SECONDS OKAY WELL I DON'T IT IN THE LOCKER AND ASK ABOUT THIS BUT- IT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW. NO WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T SEE ANY IT'S ALSO IT'S LIKE. OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY- WELL WE EXPECT THE WELL THOSE OF US IN INTO MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH KNEW THAT PANDEMICS COMING WE CAN SAY EXACTLY WHEN SO OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW AND COVERED HEAD IT WAS QUOTE UNQUOTE UNEXPECTED IN A WAY OF LIKE WE'D INSTANTLY SCHEDULE THAT- I THINK. SOMEONE REMODELING THEIR L. AND D. DELIVERY THEY SHOULD KNOW IN ADVANCE AND SO THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE BUILT INTO A CONTRACT THAT THEY'RE CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS SO FORTH SO THAT SCHOOL CAN PLAN. AND FOR SCHOOL AND AGAIN IN IN IN MEDICINE TOO RIGHT WE HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THERE'S A RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION AND THEY HAVE CONTRACTS AND THE USE WITH OTHER ONES. RIGHT THAT SURE THAT THEY HAVE THIS CLINICAL POSITIONS AVAILABLE SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TRAINEES GOING AROUND TRYING TO HUNT AROUND FOR THAT. REALIZING THAT BECAUSE OF IT YOU DON'T CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS- I ATE SO. BACK I DO THINK THAT- AND I REALIZE THAT MAYBE YOU CAN'T TRACK DIRECTLY BUT YOU DO HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ARE YOU HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER THE INSTITUTIONS I THINK IS- THE CHAIR HAD SAID- MAYBE THOSE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDING- SOME. INFORMATION ABOUT THE PIPELINE THROUGH THE SCHOOLS HOW YOU START HOW MAY COMING OUT AND THE REASONS PEOPLE DROP OUT IN THE PROCESS. RIGHT SO IS IT BECAUSE- THEY COULDN'T FIND A CLINICAL SLOT VERSES THEY HAD MANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES YOU HAVE OUTLINED SO HOPEFULLY THAT IS DATA THE BOARD CAN GET THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. IN SOME WAYS- DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER IN TERMS OF THEIR APPROVAL SO. HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TRACK- I REALIZE THAT THE DATA PERHAPS WASN'T BEING CHECKED BEFORE CODED BUT- PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THE FORD. AND I I'LL I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT. CLINICAL SITES- CHALLENGER TRAGICAL SITES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ISOLATED NURSING PROFESSION ALONE I KNOW IT'S A ISSUE IN THE MEDICINE SIDE UP FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. RESIDENTS. ITSELF FOR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AS SO THE THIS IS A THERE A LARGE TOWN. THAT WE NEED TO THINK. IN TERMS OF THE- OBLIGATION AND- AND WHAT WE EXPECT OF OUR HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE CLINICAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINEES- AS WELL SELVES- JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT- AND ALSO PREVIEWED THE DISCUSSION ABOUT- SIMULATION I WILL I WILL JUST MAKE ME WANT CALM ABOUT SIMULATION. WE HAVE SOME REALLY AMAZING SIMULATIONS NOW. BUT WELL YES IT CAN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT'S NOT LIKE FLYING A PLANE AND ACTUALLY HAVING ACTUAL INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS EVEN WITH VERY LITTLE REALISTIC SIMULATIONS. YOU DO NEED TO HAVE DIRECT PATIENT INTERACTION- IT DUFFY SUBSTITUTES FOR THAT SO I'M NOT OPPOSED TO SIMULATION HAVING MORE SIMULATION BUT THERE ARE LIMITS TO HOW FAR STIMULATION CAN GO. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THAT PERSONAL INTERACTION OF SOCIAL INTERACTION. RIGHT YOU CAN LEARN THE PHYSIOLOGY ALL THAT OTHER STUFF ON A ON A SIMULATOR BUT IT'S- IT. SIMULATOR UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T TELL YOU A REAL LIFE STORY ABOUT SOMEONE'S LIFE AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AFFECTED THEM THAT. TAKING CARE OF AN ACTUAL PATIENTS ACCOUNT SO I'M JUST GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT'S- HUGE YOU. KNOW AS PART OF YOUR ASSESSMENT AND THAT'S KIND OF A DISGUSTING TOPIC. BUT IT JUST GOES ON HANDS ON IT GETTING THAT SENSE WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM HE WATCHED. THEM GUARD YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT. YOU GET THAT MESSAGE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO- SO I'M GONNA GET TO SOME QUESTIONS. OTHER QUESTIONS- SO FIRST OF ALL- IN. OUR IN OUR BACKGROUND PAPER- DON'T. AND AGAIN YOUR- ABOUT PROGRESS THE- B. R. AND HAS MADE- I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO AUDITS SO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX THERE'S A WHISTLE BLOWER ON IT. IT WAS NOT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER RECOMMENDATION THREE I WAS KIND OF STILL FLOATING OUT THERE AND THINK THE BEER AND CLAIMS THE FINISH THEY FULLY IMPLEMENTED THERE'S SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH THE- IDEA OF THE- AUDITOR WHETHER IT ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED- CAN YOU JUST STATE. WHAT IS WHAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION THREE RELATED TO THE WHISTLE BLOWER ON IT OF I THINK TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO THAT'S THAT TWO SEPARATE- THINGS THERE SO I EXPLAINED THAT. ON THE WHISTLE BLOWER ON IT THERE WAS THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND IT IS REFLECTED ON THE CSA WEBSITE. RECOMMENDATION THREE YEP MANSION BACK. TO THE AUDIT THAT OCCURRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND- SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT NUMBER SEVEN. B. WILL NOT. SHOW THAT IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THE FRAUD THAT WAS COMPLETED. SO WE'RE UNDERSTANDING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE FULLY IMPLEMENTED ALL THREE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER AUDIT. THAT CSA WILL NOT UPDATE NUMBER SEVEN TO SHOW THAT THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THEY DO AN ADDITIONAL. ON IT OKAY AND THERE'S ON. DO YOU KNOW THAT ON GO RIGHT NOW OR WHAT WHAT'S OF THE AND I GUESS WE HAVE TO HAVE TO BUT YES. YEAH WE'VE BEEN KIND. WHEN AUDITOR WILL BECOME INTO DO WHATEVER. AUDIT OKAY THEN ALL OURSELVES WITH DCA. AND DCA FOUNDER THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE FOR WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FOLLOW UP OKAY. SO YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE AUDITORS OKAY THANK YOU YES AND THEN THE OTHER ONE. WE HAVE ISSUE TWENTY ONE WAS IT. AGAIN REALLY TO AUDITOR G. LACK ON RECOMMENDATION I THINK. ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY TWO AS WELL- AND- SO THIS IS ABOUT THE- OVERSIGHT THE FEW LICENSURE- PROGRAMS AND- FEELING. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO AGAIN THE- AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN ISSUE TWENTY THREE ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE TWENTY THREE DUPLICATION PROGRAM REVIEW AS WELL AND- SO THEY TALKED ABOUT- SO THE pON IT. IN THE INITIAL PRESENTATION- BUT YET AGAIN TRYING TO REDUCE THE OVERHEAD- AND ON ON THE PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW THEY DID GOING TO THE- THE- THEY'LL NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL NURSING CREDITORS AND THEN THE OTHER B. R. N. AND- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE- MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO REDUCE THE DUPLICATION SO WE CAN AGAIN REDUCE THE BURDEN ON OUR PROGRAMS. AND THEN ALSO THE OTHER ONE IS ISSUE TWENTY FOUR WHICH ISN'T RELATED TO THE AUDIT BUT- THERE'S ALSO MADE MENTION THAT DVR AND HAS VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIREMENTS ARE FACULTY THAT HAVE ALSO MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOME THE PROGRAMS- IN TERMS OF- THAT THE YOU KNOW BUILDING A FACULTY BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SPECIFIC AND- WHETHER THERE'S- SOME THOUGHT ABOUT- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW HOW SPECIFIC DO WE NEED TO BE IN TERMS OF THE FACULTY REQUIREMENTS- SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN GET TO YOU KNOW BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE FULL FACT AGAIN CERTAINLY RECOGNIZING WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL QUALITY AND EXPERTISE IN THE FACT THAT. SO CAN YOU JUST TOUCH ON THE OVERLAP THE JOY- PRODIGY LIKE AUDIT AND- REDUCING DUPLICATE SERVICES AND THEN ALSO THE BURDEN AT THE NATIONALLY ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FACULTY RECORD. THE QUALIFICATIONS. I GOT THAT YES I WILL DO THAT FOR YOU SO. THE FIRST ONE IS. THE A CREDIT. FOR GROUP ALL. SO SOMETHING YOU'RE FAMILIAR. TO PANIC SHORT IS THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- PROVES THAT. THAT FACILITIES AND THEN THE JOINT COMMISSION WILL COME IN TO DO AN ACCREDITATION ARE NOT. COMING TO DO A CREDIT CHECK THAT'S IDENTICAL IT'S REALLY WHAT WE DO. SO THE BOARD WILL COME IN AND DO AN APPROVAL AND THEN A STANDARD SEE SEE ANY RETURN NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCIES WILL COME IN AND DO AN ACCREDITATION VISIT ON TOP OF THAT. IT'S GREAT FOR MARKETING IT REALLY HELPS ATTRACT STUDENTS AND IT HELPS ATTRACT FACULTY WHICH IS FANTASTIC FOR THAT SCHOOL. NOT REQUIREMENT THOUGH TO EDUCATE. SO WE ACTUALLY HEARD YOU GUYS LOUD AND CLEAR THE SUNSET AND- LAST YEAR AND WE STARTED- JOINT MEETINGS WITH THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN COME INTO ALIGNMENT. AND DO THE STICK. I MET WITH ACCREDITING AGENCIES SEE SEE ANY ACE AND- I MET WITH NCSP AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW OTHER BOARDS OF NURSING OR DO A JOINT VISITS. AND SO WE DID OUR VERY FIRST JOINT VISITS IN SEPTEMBER IN SAN DIEGO CITY COLLEGE AND IT WAS. IMPORTANT SO IMPORTANT I WENT AHEAD AND JOINED IN THE- DID THE BEST. I WANTED TO SEE FIRST HAND WE HAVE SENSE THEN- YOU CAN USE THAT AND WE'VE DONE I BELIEVE FOR MORE VISITS BETTER JOINTS WE HAVE A WIND NOW ALL OF OUR CONTINUING APPROVAL VISITS. WITH YOUR CREDITORS WE WILL GO SIDE BY SIDE ADDITIONALLY THEY GIVE A REPORT TO THE CREDITING AGENCIES WE- SAID WE WILL ACCEPT THAT SAME REPORT. EXCEPT IN THE AREAS THAT IT DOESN'T TOUCH OUR REGULATIONS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STILL MEETING. AND THEY WILL DO AN ADDENDUM TO ADD UP AND- OFFER THAT TO US. AND SO GREAT FEEDBACK SO FAR ON DOING THAT TOGETHER AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT MOVIE FOR IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND TALKING WITH THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS AND SHE SAID. I CAN NOW RETIRE YOUR KNOWING THAT MY LIFE'S WORK IS DONE WE FINALLY GOT THIS HAPPENING AT THE B. R. AT. THE NEXT ONE THAT YOU WANT ME TO READ. WHAT THE FACULTY APPROVE. YEP AND- I YOU GUYS KNOW THAT HAVE A TEACHING. BOARD HERE IN. CALIFORNIA THAT WE USE AND THEY OFFER A PRE LUMINARY TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND THAT A PERMANENT TEACHING CREDENTIAL. AND THAT'S IDENTICAL TO WHAT OUR BOARD DOES WE HAVE A PERSON COME AND THEY ENTER INTO EDUCATION BECAUSE WE'RE ALL TRAINED AS NURSES. TRADERS FESPACO. SO THEY COME N AND THEY GET BEYOND APPROVAL AND THEY BECOME ESSENTIALLY A FREE WOMEN ARE CREDENTIALED. TEACHER THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE CALL AN ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR THEY DO THAT FOR ONE YEAR. AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO MOVE ON TO BE AN INSTRUCTOR WHICH INSTRUCTOR GROUP ALL IDENTICAL TO THAT PERMANENT PRODUCTION THAT THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING BOARD DOES. AND SO WE STAY IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT. WEIGHT IS DIFFERENT AND WHAT THE CREDITORS DO IS THEY DO A ONE TIME APPROVAL. AND THEY APPROVE YOU AS AN INSTRUCTOR AND HE CAN TEACH WHATEVER YOU WANT. WELL NCSP AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE WORD NURSING HAS RESEARCH ON THAT AND THEY TALK ABOUT HAVING RECENCY AND SUBJECT MATTER CURRENCY. YOU WOULD NOT WANT SOMEBODY WHO IS A PSYCH NURSE TO TEACH OBSTETRICS. BABY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TEACH THAT CONTENT LIKEWISE YOU WOULD NOT WANT SOMEBODY THAT IS A PEDIATRIC NURSE. TO SITE AND SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONTENT AREAS THAT THEY ARE RECENT AND EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF A BEDSIDE NURSE. SO WE DO THAT APPROVAL PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY ACCREDITORS REQUIRE A MASTER'S DEGREE. OR A TERMINAL DEGREE IN ORDER TO TEACH THAT'S NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR TEACHING CREDENTIAL WHERE DOES. YOU CAN ENTER IN WITH A BACHELOR'S WITH A MASTERS AND GET THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY HELPED THAT PIPELINE. BUT TEACHERS WE HAVE A FACULTY SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT OUR BOARD DOES IS WE ARE ALLOW FOR SO DEGREE COMPARED. TO IN AND- IN A CALL SETTING WHERE THEY CAN- MAY. WHERE THEY CAN HELP DRESSING CHANGES. WE HAVE A CALL BACK MEMBER PRESS. WE ALSO THE ABILITY WHERE THEY CAN ENTER WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE- AS AN ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR THEY CAN DO A COMPLETE CLINICAL ROTATION THAT'S WHAT THEIR EXPERTISE IS THAT THE BAD SIDE. AND THEY REPORT BACK TO YOU A FACULTY MEMBER THAT HAS A MASTER'S DEGREE INSTRUCTOR PREPARED NURSE. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGING ON THAT COURSE THEY GET THE GRADES THEY MAKE THAT CURRICULUM PLAN. THEY MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS THE GRADUATE OBJECTIVES ETCETERA SO THE BOARD ACTUALLY HAS MORE ENTRY POINTS INTO BEING A FACULTY MEMBER TO ADDRESS THE FACULTY SHORTAGE. THEN THE ACCREDITOR AGENCY DOES AND WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING THAT SAYS YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONTENT SPECIFIC. BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT WANT A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE TO TEACH SOMEBODY HOW TO DELIVER A BABY AND I WILL BE SELLING WHERE IT ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH. NURSING OKAY AT APPRECIATE FIRST FIRST OF ALL- AT THE PRESIDIO CONGRATULATIONS ON ALIGNING ACCREDITATION APPROVAL DURING THE SAME VISIT TO SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW RAN A PROGRAM AND HAD TO GET CREDITED I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT INVOLVES SO. WHEN THAT CAN HAPPEN THAT CERTAINLY MAKES THINGS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT AND SMOKE. SOME OF THEIR- I THINK ON THE FACULTY SIDE I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I GUESS AGAINST SOMEONE WHO'S A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR YOU KNOW MEDICAL EDUCATOR- AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE CONTENT STUFF AS WELL BUT- FOR EXAMPLE YOU SAID WELL YOU DON'T HAVE PEDIATRIC NURSE TEACHING PSYCHIATRY. YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH ACCEPTS ACTUALLY DOES A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PEDIATRICS. RIGHT SO AND THEN YOU'RE YOU AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE GOING TO NURSING SCHOOL SO IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY GONNA BE A PSYCH NURSE IN THE FUTURE THEY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED MORE EDUCATION SO. I GUESS IT AND YES. PEDIATRIC NURSE PRIOR WHEN HAVE AS MUCH NON ABOUT CERTAINLY SO SIDE. ISSUES RIGHT CERTAINLY NOT ADULTS. ISSUES BUT- I GUESS GIVE THE SHE- I WANNA BE SURE WE'RE NOT OVER GOING OVER CREDENTIAL ISM I GUESS OF WHERE PLAYERS ARE LIKE OKAY YEAH WE WERE TRYING TO TRAIN SOMEONE TO BE IN OUR END RIGHT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT AND SO. AND THEN WHO'S THEN GOING TO ACTUALLY FUTURE FIELD DIFFERENTIATE POTENTIALLY THE FUTURE OF THE INSIDE THE SUB SPECIALIZED BUT THE MAN AT WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW AND AGAIN YOUR PRIME RATE A PSYCH NURSE FIVE IS GOOD TEACH- B. BUT I'M NOT PSYCH NURSE SO I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH THE SECOND OF MAY CORRECT ME. BUT I DO THINK THAT. FOR SOME OF THESE FIELDS LIKE CERTAINLY A YOU KNOW A FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER OR A- A PEDIATRIC NURSE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TEACH SOME BASICS OF MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE DANCE STUFF AND YOU NEED TO. SO I. WE'RE TRYING TO BE OUT HOW TO BUILD BROAD PIPELINE. IN IF ONE OF THE- NARROW CHOKE POINTS AS WE CAN'T GET ENOUGH FACULTY YURI HAVE CHALLENGES WITH NO PAY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. I WAS ON THE SHOW WERE NOT PUT IN REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT- WOULD. RESTRICT THE CAPACITY OF SCHOOLS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING OF COURSE CERTAINLY THE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION WE DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE THAT. BUT- SO I JUST GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE. CERTAINLY THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY AND AGAIN. YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE GRADATION BODIES AS WELL- BILL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBILITIES IN MY BUILDING AND WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT WOULD HAVE I'M SURE YOU DO. IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE ON THEIR EDUCATION RIGHT AND SO I JUST WANNA TO YOU KNOW. HAVE A THINK ABOUT THAT. YEAH ONE OTHER THING THAT WE ACTUALLY JUST DID WERE MOVING TOWARDS IT THIS MONTH IS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO. I'M GONNA PUT MY CARD FOR THE X. WE ARE DOING A ONE TIME FACULTY APPROVAL. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE ASKED AND THAT WAS BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM OUR DIRECTORS. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST IF YOU TAUGHT. AT- GETTING A STATE UNIV. YOU WERE. BUT THEY IF YOU WANT TO. STATE UNIV. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET ANOTHER WE ARE ABLE WE'RE ELIMINATING. AND IT'S A- ONE TIME APPROVAL AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE ADDED TO OUR BREEZE LICENSE LOOK UP. SAME IS EXACTLY CORRECTLY. BY THE END OF THIS MONTH AND EVERYTHING GOES SMOOTHLY. SO THAT WILL HELP TO DECREASE THAT BUREAUCRACY OKAY THAT'S WONDERFUL WONDERFUL HERE- ANOTHER PART OF EDUCATION I ALWAYS ASK MY CONTINUING EDUCATION- NOW I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE FROM MY READ THE BACKGROUND PAPER YOU'RE ONLY DOING C. AUDITED THERE'S COMPLAINTS WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER BOARDS WHICH ACTUALLY. DID DOES A C. E. YOU KNOW THEY DO A SAMPLE TO REVIEW- AND- AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO REPORT ON COMPLIANCE RATE SO I MEAN- SO. I MEAN. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT WHY ARE WE DOING TO MONITOR C. E. AND THEN ALSO IN ADDITION. BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED OVER ALSO PROVES THE C. E. ITSELF- AND I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES IN THE PAST ABOUT. SOME OF THE YOU KNOW. QUALITY OF THE C. E. R. X. A CALL IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT- I GUESS. AND I'VE ASKED IN THE PAST- DO YOU HAVE STANDARDS FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING C. COURSES BE SURE THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OF THE PERSON WHO'S TEACHING ARE SPONSORING THE C. E. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING EARLY. DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AS WELL SO- FIRST OF ALL C. E. AUDITS. AND ALSO- COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND THEN. S. GIVING APPROVAL ROLE- CONFLICT OF INTEREST. REGARDING CONTINUING EDUCATION. OKAY I THINK I GOT ALL THAT. THE FIRST ONE IS. I'MNOT SURE IF IT WAS NOT CLEAR IN OUR SUNSET BACKGROUND- PAPER BUT WE DO. RANDOM AUDITS WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT OKAY ALL. RIGHT SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. AND IF WE NEED TO. GIVE YOU STATS ABSOLUTELY WILL I CAN YOU THE WE DO THE AUDIT AND ONLY A SMALL PERCENT IS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO ENFORCEMENT YOU. HAVE A FOLLOW UP BECAUSE IT WASN'TCORRECT. IT IS CLEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWO POINT SIX ORDERED FORSMAN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE POINT NINE WENT TO ENFORCEMENT DOWN TO UNDER PERCENT NOW GOING TO ENFORCE OKAY. THOUGH ADDITIONALLY WITH THAT- I'VE LOOKED INTO EVERY SYSTEM OUR BRIEF SYSTEM ON LICENSE RENEWAL. ASKED BY A LICENSEE TO SUBMIT THAT COPY OF THE CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION FROM THERE SEE YEARS. THAT'S NOT A HARD STOP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES SAYS YOU MUST IN ORDER TO RENEW. WE SAY YOU ATTEST TO IT AND YOU KEEP THOSE RECORDS FOR FOUR YEARS. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO A LOT OF YOU TO SEE IF THAT HAPPENS- I AM LOOKING AT BRING YOU TOWARDS THE BOARD A REGULATORY PROPOSAL. THEN MAKE THAT A HARD STOP INCREASE TO HAVE OUR LICENSEES THE NET OF CERTIFICATES. THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BENEFIT US B. HONEST. AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE OF OUR LICENSEES WHAT WE FIND IS AFTER FOUR YEARS THEY'RE NOT KEEPING THEIR CERTIFICATE. WE CAN BE THE REPOSITORY OF FOR THEM TO HAVE THOSE CERTIFICATES ON. EVERY SYSTEM THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING THEM LATER- WHEN THEY'RE FOCUSED ON SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WHAT THAT ALSO DOES FOR US IT ALLOWS US TO JUST DO A RANDOM MY AUDIT BY PULLING THE RECORDS GROWN RESISTANT. VERSUS HAVING TO CONTACT THE LICENSEE AND SAY HEY SEND TO ME YOUR SEATS SO THAT'S A REGULATORY UPDATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION I HAVE TO BRING IT FROM OUR BOARD AND SEE WHERE WE MOVE RIGHT ON THAT. ON YOUR FINAL QUESTION I FORGOT. WHAT IT DOES ACTUALLY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE IF YOU APPROVE C. E. DO YOU HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY BASICALLY SAYING THAT YOU. A DISCLOSURE OF ANY CONFLICTS ARE ALSO NOT HAVING DIRECT CONFLICTS. WITH THE MATURE YOUR T. CHANGE THE YOUR FINANCIAL. IN IT. SO YOU'RE NOT SENSE ADVERTISE. THE STUFF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH WE END IT SAID LAST YEAR THE SONS THIS WAS THE DAY QUESTION AND WE DID HAVE A TALK WITH THE- WE STILL. HOWEVER BECAUSE HAVE S. THAT QUESTION TO OTHER ABOARD DO YOU SEE A HALF OFF THE RADAR AND THEY ARE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING A GENERALIZED TOPIC DEBATES RESTATEMENTS ALL OF THE BOARDS OF GIRLS WE WILL ALIGN WITH THEM WHEN THAT COMES OUT. OKAY SO THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND IN IN MANY WAYS I APPRECIATE THAT THE BOARD THAT THE VC ITSELF BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME QUESTION ACROSS THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION AND APPRECIATE AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ASKED LET ME ASK ME QUESTIONS- THE- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. COMMON CALICO. FOR IS THAT WE'VE HAD HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- PROMOTE. MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION THAT'S UNDERMINED THE PUBLIC HEALTH- DATS- AND OF COURSE NURSES ARE VERY TRUSTED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SO CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE JUST WITH NURSING WE'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF. MEDICINE THE MEDICAL BOARD. OTHER BOARDS AS WELL. I DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU IF. SO FIRST OF ALL. IS THIS AN ISSUE THE BORED LOOKING AT- NURSES WHO ARE ACTIVELY PROMOTING MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER KOBE JACKSON NATIONS AND OTHER THINGS AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THAT- BASICALLY AGAIN AS A PROTECTOR. OF THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC. TO ADDRESS A LICENSEE'S WHO ARE ENGAGED IN. SUCH ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY THAT'S FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL PERSONAL FINANCIAL WHAT IS FINANCIAL OR OTHER PERSONAL GAIN. AND PROMOTING- MISINFORMATION OR DISINFORMATION UNDERMINES PUBLIC HEALTH. YEAH WE ALWAYS HOPE THAT OUR NURSES WILL DO THAT BUT WE DO HAVE THE- TEN. PUT THEM THROUGH OUR ENFORCEMENT UNIT. UNIT AND IT DO YOU DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON THAT AND WE TAKE EVERY ONE OF THESE COMPLAINTS ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS. AND SO WHEN WE GET A COMPLAINT WE DO AN INDIVIDUALIZED- INVESTIGATION AND WE- DIRECTED THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS NEEDED BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE FIND- IT'S NOT JUST CALL WITH SPECIFIC WE HAVE NURSES THEY GET MISINFORMATION AND- FOR OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN COAL AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON THOSE. WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST TALK MY SPECIFIC CASE BUT CAN YOU. YEAH CAN YOU INDICATE TO ME ROUGHLY HOW MANY CASES ARE CURRENTLY. OKAY FOR YOU TO GIVE ME THAT I WILL OKAY IF YOU CAN GET THAT BACK TO ME AND I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU A DOCTOR FAN. LET ME TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES- THAT- CENTER PANDAS ADDRESSED. WITH RESPECT TO THIS APPROVAL AUTHORITY OVER FACULTY. ARE YOU WHERE DO ANY OF THE OTHER HEALTH CARE LICENSING BOARDS HAVE APPROVAL AUTHORITY OVER FACULTY WHO TEACH IN. ADVOCATION OF FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE MEDICINE PHARMACY. CHIROPRACTIC DENTISTRY. WITHIN CALIFORNIA. SO WITHIN CALIFORNIA B. B. N. P. TI N. B. R. N. B. OLY ONES THAT HAVE EDUCATION APPROVAL INCLUDING THE FACULTY HOWEVER WE ARE ALIGNED WITH THE NATIONAL ACCREDITATION WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS I UNDERSTAND THAT SO WIRE NURSES IN THIS PARTICULAR SETTING CALIFORNIA UNIQUE IN THAT REGARD EDUCATION. THAT REQUIRES THE NURSING BOARD. TO REVIEW AND APPROVE WHETHER ITS LIFETIME OR INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT- FACULTY. STILL THE EVIDENCE AND C-SPAN IS A NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARD OF NURSING IS A ROBUST COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY MONITORS EVERYTHING NATIONWIDE- AND WORLDWIDE SO THEY HAD EVIDENCE OF- WHAT THE BOARDS OF NURSING STEW IN AFGHANISTAN BUT THE BOARDS OF NURSING DO AND- AUSTRALIA END OF OURS IN SO BASED ON THAT OVERWHELMING WEALTH AND EVIDENCE THEY ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE SUCCESS OF A PROGRAM REALLY LIES WITH THE FACULTY AND THE ABILITY OF THE FACULTY TO BE FULL TIME. THEY HAVE A LOW TURNOVER RATE HAVE A LOW TURNOVER RATE AT THE- DIRECTORS AS WELL AND DO YOU HAVE- HIGH COMPETENCY LEVEL IN THE CONTENT THAT THEY TEACH SO BASED ON THAT THE FACULTY IS WHAT SETS UP THE SUCCESS FOR THE PROGRAM REMEMBER. THAT REALLY. THAT'S NOT THAT'S DO THAN ANY OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE AND- IS IT. AND ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT THESE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE ROUTINELY. AND FACTOR REQUIRED TO BE ACCREDITED SO ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT AN ACCREDITING BODY WOULD. INDEPENDENTLY AND SEPARATELY ASSESS AND- INITIALLY ACCREDITING AND RENEWAL THE YOUR CREDIT AND AT THE POINT OF RENEWAL OF ACCREDITATION. A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IT'S NOT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE ACCREDITED AND IN FACT THE STATISTICS THAT NCS COLLECTED SHOWS THAT THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE DECREASED THEIR PERCENTAGE OF ACCREDITATION WELL. KNOWN FOREIGN. OKAY AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S WITH US WE DO NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE. ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ACCREDITED. HELLO THERE ARE MANY OTHER. BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAMS DO WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA NURSING. NOT MANY DEGREE PROGRAMS BY JORDI ARE CREDITED- IT'S OUR ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR ENTRY ASTOR'S PROGRAMS ARE A 100% RIGHT BUT THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUALLY ASSOCIATES USE ME THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAM TRYING TO CUT TO THE CHASE HERE THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS WERE THOSE PROGRAMS GENERALLY- THAT ARE CONDUCTED AT OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THEY NOT HUNDRED. OF OUR PROGRAMS THERE ARE STEPS YOU TO GREET AND WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX PROGRAMS SO THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WELL THEN OKAY SO LET'S LET'S CONCENTRATE ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACCREDITED. WHAT IS THE VALUE ADDED MANY OF THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THE NURSING BOARD AS A AS A FUND SURPLUS. IF YOU WERE FINED INSOLVENT OR CLOSE TO IT. MY QUESTIONS WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND MUCH MORE POINTED. BUT WE STILL WANT EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS AND I'M SURE YOUR LICENSEES WANT THAT TOO. SO MY QUESTION IS IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED ACCREDITED. ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS WHY WOULD YOU WHY WOULD YOU. SPEND TIME ON THE ACCREDITED ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH RESPECT TO FACULTY APPROVAL. WHY WOULDN'T IF YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE WHY WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE. ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNACCREDITED. SO WE DO. CONCENTRATE ON THE ONES THAT ARE UNACCREDITED AS WELL SEE CREDIT PROGRAMS SO THE ACCREDITATION PROGRAMS THEY HAVE AN EIGHT YEAR CYCLE FOR CONTINUING APPROVAL VISIT OR A TEN YEAR CYCLE. WE HAVE MOVED TO THE EIGHT AND TEN YEAR CYCLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ACCREDITED WE CONTINUED WITH OUR FIVE YEAR CYCLE OF REVIEW. I MEAN MASS MARKET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FACULTY APPROVAL HERE. BACK T. APPROVALS ARE PART OF THAT AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU KIND OF PROBABLY SPOKE TOO FAST AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- WHEN I WAS TALKING TO DOCTOR CAN. I MENTIONED THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A ONE TIME FACULTY APPROVAL THAT'S A HUGE HUGE CHANGE FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST IN THE PAST WE USED TO DO THAT FOR EVERY SCHOOL. AND NOW WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL BOARD AND JUST LIKE THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL BOARD AS A SINGLE SUBJECT OR MULTIPLE SUBJECTS. WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE FACTS AND SO. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE OTHER SCHOOLS AND IN THOSE- AREAS THAT HAVE ACCREDITATION. AND THE OTHER BOARDS IN GIRLS THEY PARTNER WITH THE TEACHING CREDENTIALING BOARD AS WELL SO THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. WE DON'T DO THAT WE ARE THE TEACHING CREDENTIALING BOARD FOR THE FOR THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING FOR THAT. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THAT DUAL ROLE WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER BOARD THAT IS POTENTIALLY OUR TEACHERS WE DO THAT SO HOPEFULLY THAT KIND OF CLEARS THAT UP A LITTLE BIT. AND WITH THE APPROVAL VISITS THE APPROVAL VISITS DON'T ARE SORRY FOR ANY PATIENT VISITS DON'T OCCUR PRIOR TO PROGRAM. WE DO A PROGRAM APPROVAL. IT CREDIT EACH LATER TENURE LATER SO WE THE MEAN THERE NOT ACCREDITED THEY ARE APPROVED THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF FACULTY APPROVAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS AND SO IT'S VERY COMPLEX THE USED TO RETREAT DO YOU STILL READ DOES THE BOARD STILL RETAIN APPROVAL AUTHORITY. OVER NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTOR HIRES AT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS- NURSING PROGRAMS YES WE DO IS SIMILAR TO THE TEACHING CREDENTIALING BOARD RIGHT- INSULT MY QUESTION MY QUESTION. MY QUESTION IS THIS AND YOU CAN TELL I'M NOT PARTICULARLY- A SUPPORTER OF THIS PIECE OF REPARATION I AGREE WHEN YOU HAVE BECAUSE YOU DON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS AND- SOME OTHER PROGRAM THAT'S ON A STREET CORNER SOMEWHERE THAT'S TURNING OUT QUALITY NURSES. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A PROGRAM IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WITH THE WITH THE CUT COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WITH THE DEAN OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL ALL APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATELY CREDENTIALED BECAUSE THE YOUR THE INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION REQUIRES THAT. FOR PROGRAMMATIC ACCREDITATION IF THE SCHOOL HAS THAT. AND YOU HAVE A FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND IN MANY CASES. FRANKLY LABOR REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE TEACHING FACULTY. WHY IS IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE NURSING BOARD APPROVED NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTORS IN EACH OF THESE SCHOOLS APPROVE THE HIRING. AS PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. C. H. AGAIN IT GOESBACK TO IN RTP WITH TEACHERS THEY HAVE A APPROVAL PROCESS THEY WORK HARD THROUGH EDUCATION AND PREPARATION TO GET A PRELIMINARY TEACHING CREDENTIALS THEY DO THE SAME THING THEN GET A PERMANENT TEACHING CREDENTIAL YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THE PRELIMINARY ONE FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RENEWED EVERY FIVE YEARS IT'S IDENTICAL SQUARE RECENCY PROCESS. THEY ALSO AS THE TEACHER BOARD THEY CREDENTIAL BEAR PRINCIPLES BUT THE SAME THING AS OUR DIRECTOR OF NURSING WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY ARE IN A STRANGE AND ALREADY WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE IS NOT TRAINED IN A LOT OF THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT TRAINED IN CURRICULAR DESIGN SO WHEN YOU GET A BACHELOR'S PREPARED NURSE YOU HAVE THEM AND THEY ARE GREAT THEY ARE TRAINED IN THEORETICAL- NURSING KNOWLEDGE BUT THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE MASTER'S DEGREE. THAT MASTER'S DEGREE PERSON DOES HAVE CURRICULAR- INSIGHT THEY DO HAVE CLASSES AROUND THAT AND THEY THEY THEN EARN BAD BILITY BUT THEY ALSO HAVE SPECIALIZATIONS IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PERSON THAT WANTS TO SPECIALIZE AND DO A MASTERS IN NURSING BUT HAVE A FOCUS IN I. T. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE CURRICULAR DESIGN SO IT'S NOT JUST DEGREE SPECIFIC SO IT DOES REQUIRE REVIEW PROCESS. AND WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT EIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EFFICIENCIES WE ARE AS WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO DECREASE THE BURDEN ON OUR NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTORS I HEAR YOU ON THAT I WANT TO DO THE SAME THING AND SO DOES OUR FORD WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WE VOTED ON THESE WITHIN- OUR BOARD MEETINGS TO MAKE THESE THINGS AND ADDRESS THEM. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFICIENCIES FOR TRYING TO DECREASE THAT BURDEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROVAL AND ACCREDITATION THAT ACCREDITORS VISITS AFTER THE APPROVAL IT CAN. BE YOURS IT IS NOT MANDATED FOR ANY OF OUR PRO TAB APPROVAL HEALTH. IN EVEN IF THEY BECOME AN APPROVED PROGRA. IT'S AN APT SITE DOES A CREDIT PROGRAMS REQUIRE THEM TO BE A ONE TIME APPROVAL FOR AN INSTRUCTOR AND LIKE I SHARED BEFORE YOU DON'T WANT. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT CONTENT SPECIFIC CONTENT EXPERTS TO TEACH THE NEXT BREED AT THE NEXT- BATCH OF NURSES. COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE. IF THEY'RE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PATIENT PROTECTION COMES FROM WELL UNDER HIS. I WILL WANT. MY WORDS USE ME I DON'T I WILL TELL YOU THIS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. HAS SORT OF AN IRON FISTED CONTROL OVER NURSING EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- MAYBE THAT'S OKAY IF THE SCHOOLS ACCEPTED I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALL OF THEM THOSE THAT HAVE NURSING PROGRAMS- I'M NOT SURE THAT THE THAT SORT OF CONTROL WELL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO OR MAYBE LONGER I DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE TODAY AND IT'S CERTAINLY RESTRICTS FLEXIBILITY IT CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE TIMING OF DECISIONS- AND I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE THAT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. MAYBE WE SHOULD EXPLORE THIS HAS THE EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO DO THE KIND OF REVIEW THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOUR- NURSING EDUCATION COORDINATOR VACANCY RATE- AND PERHAPS SOME ADJUSTMENT TO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT EFFECT THAT NEC. VACANCY RATE AND THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF ANY SEES THAT THE BOARD IS. HAS HAD TO CARRY ON THE ON THE BOOKS- IN YEARS PAST BUT LET ME JUMP AHEAD I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL. I'M JUST TRYING TO MOVE ALONG AND I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. WITH RESPECT TO THE EDUCATION PROGRAM APPROVAL I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE AND YOU YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT. NURSING PROGRAMS I GUESS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT. CURRICULA FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM AND- GIVEN THE IRON FISTED CONTROL THAT I PERCEIVE THE BOARD HAS OVER THESE PROGRAMS. WHY IN THE WORLD HAS THE BOARD NOT PUT OUT. THE COMMON CURRICULUM FOR NURSING EDUCATION. A COMMON CORE CURRICULUM ONE THAT LITTLE THAT IF SCHOOLS ADOPTED WOULD RESTRICT THIS SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE BOARD- EXERCISES WITH RESPECT TO THE NURSING PROGRAMS. ENTER THE EXPRESS THE EXTENT THAT YOU NEED TO INSPECT AND APPROVE WHICH IS I GUESS A LANGUAGE THAT WE ALL USE HERE. YOU WOULD ONLY NEED TO INSPECT AND APPROVE ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THE CORE CURRICULUM IN PLACE. AND TO THAT YOU WOULD INSPECTED APPROVED AND DETAIL ANY ADD ONS TO THE CORE CURRICULUM. IS THERE A REASON. CALIFORNIA DID PUT OUT A COMMENT CURRICULUM BACK AT THE TWO THOUSAND NINE WE DO HAVE SOME OF OUR STUDENTS SCHOOLS THAT ARE STILL UTILIZING THAT CURRICULUM- HOWEVER WE IT WAS FOUND TO NOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSE NURSING DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER CURRICULUM WHEN IT COMES A LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A MISUNDERSTANDING AS WELL. WE ONLY APPROVE THE CONTENT THAT IS REQUIRED FOR LICENSING ALL OTHER CONTENT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT SCHOOL AND SPECIFIC TO PREDICT GREASE. CALIFORNIA BEING A LEADER ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS INTO THE PROFESSION WE HAVE AN ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S WE HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WE HAVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE WE HAVE THE THIRTY UNITS LV ENDS ARE AN OPTION. SO WITH THAT THERE'S NO DEGREE REQUIREMENT WITHIN CALIFORNIA WE ONLY HAVE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS ADDITIONALLY THAT AFFECTS THE RECIPROCITY IN THE INTEREST OF OTHER NURSES FROM OUT OF STATE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. IF WE HAD AN IRONCLAD YES THAT SAID THIS CURRICULUM MUST BE THIS THEN WE WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF NURSES THAT WOULD MEET THAT REQUIREMENT. FROM OUT OF STATE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA THAT'S ANOTHER THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT THAT I HAVE A QUESTION ON WHICH IS WHY YOU EVEN IF YOU HAVE A TEN YEAR NURSE. COMING IN FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHY YOU DO A COMPLETE PRE LICENSURE REVIEW OF THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND OF THE TEN YEAR NURSE BUT LET. ME FOCUS ON THE QUESTION AT HAND. YOU APPROVED FOR. YOU APPROVE NURSING. BUT YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T PUT OUT AND REQUIRE A CORE NURSING CURRICULA. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME AND IT CREATES A PROBLEM. FRANKLY IN THE PIPELINE BETWEEN THE ADN PROGRAMS AND A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN NURSING PROGRAMS WHERE THE CURRICULA DO NOT ALIGN. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAS THE TIME TO SPEND ON SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD MOVE TO THE TOP OF THE LIST. IS TO TRY TO ARRIVE AT A CORE CURRICULUM WHICH YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DICTATE EITHER IT'S- EITHER. IN YOUR CHARTER IS A BOARD OR THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. AND SO MY QUESTION IS WHY NOT. YEAH AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE IT IN OUR PROFESSIONS CODE WHERE WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKE IT BACK ONLINE WHAT WE FOUND WAS A LOT OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE- THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST WAY FORWARD AND SO THEY HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL CURRICULA AND SOMETIMES WITH THE CSU SYSTEM THEY ONLY ACCEPT SIXTY UNIT TRANSFER WE HAD SOME NURSING PROGRAMS THAT WERE WELL OVER EIGHTY SO THEY'VE HAD TO DECREASE THAT YOU ALSO GET INTO COMPETITION WITH YOUR SCIENCE- INSTRUCTORS AT THE COLLEGE WHERE THEY BELIEVE. WE ONLY HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR AT LEAST SIXTEEN UNITS OF SCIENCES AND THEY SAY- OR NINETEEN SORRY AND THEY SAY NO I NEED TWENTY FOUR UNITS ARE NOT GOING TO DROP MY REQUIREMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY SO THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT HAPPEN. IN THE DIVERSE ACADEMIC SETTING WITHIN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS WE DON'T HAVE MAXIMUM STANDARDS I WOULD THINK THAT IF WE PULL CORD MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM OR JUST A BLANK STANDARD- I THINK THAT WOULD. CHANGE THE WAY THAT NURSING EDUCATION YES THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR BOARD IS LOOKED AT YET I'D BE HAPPY TO BRING THAT IN FRONT OF THEM TO HAVE THEM CONSIDER THAT- BUT- ARE ARE I THINK WE HEAR A LOT OF FLASHBACK FROM RDG DIRECTORS BECAUSE THEY TRULY DO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE CURRICULUM THAT FITS THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC IN THEIR COMMUNITY- AND SO WE'VE- ONLY EVER SAID IF WE ARE IN. A MINIMUM LICENSE REQUIREMENTS- AS IT PERTAINS TO CURRICULUM AND NOT A SET STANDARD- BUT I CAN SEE THAT THE STATE STANDARD COULD HAVE SOME BENEFITS IT MAY ALSO HAVE SOME- COLLINS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND REVIEW ALL OF THAT. THE GREAT THING IS WE DO HAVE THE NURSING EDUCATION WORKFORCE- ADVISORY COMMITTEE NEED BACK AND- WE REALIGN THEM BACK IN NOVEMBER WE WERE BORED AND THEY WILL BE MEETING COME AGAIN IN APRIL AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE TASKED TO LOOK AT. SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR RECOMMENDATION- CENTER ROCK AND BRING IT FORWARD TO THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN COME UP WITH I COULD SEE THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED I HEAR YOU WANT THEM AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY SET MINIMUM STANDARDS YOU AND YOUR YOUR BOARD TEAM TELL ME THAT SOMEONE WHO GRADUATES FROM A TWO OR THREE YEAR PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR SOME OTHER PROGRAM OF THE- THAT QUALIFIES FOR THE EXAM AND FOR THE REGISTERED NURSING. LICENSE CAN TAKE THAT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND MOVE IT ENTIRELY TO A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. SCHOOL OF NURSING OR SOME OTHER SCHOOL OF NURSING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CALL THE CORE CURRICULUM. AN INMATE ALL OF ALL THE BASIC REBEL THE BASIC NURSING REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO RETAKE ANY CLINICAL NURSING COURSES AND INSTEAD CONCENTRATE ON THE LIBERAL ARTS COURSES AND- THE MANAGEMENT COURSES THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ATM AND THE B. S. AND- THEN I'M SATISFIED BUT I SUSPECT. THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IS THAT DOESN'T. EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. IT SAY. EXITING DOES THAT WELL I KNOW I WAS. WAS OF THAT PROBE IS YOU KNOW. STATE YEAH. IT THE FIRST. JUST TAKES MONTHS LATER BUT A REGIONAL. CURRICULUM BROKE GROUP THAT IS LOOKING AT THAT THEY'RE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON IT IT IS MADE UP OF OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS AND THEY WILL BE PUTTING THAT OUT AND THAT WOULD BE PERFECT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. GATHER INCLUDING THE EVIDENCE AND SUBMIT APPROVAL I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY DOES THAT TAKE A CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR SITTING IN HIS DISTRICT OFFICE CONVENING. LOCAL NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTORS DEANS AND COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND PROVOSTS. TO DO THAT IS THAT NOT A FUNCTION OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. BECAUSE BECAUSE IF YOU DID IT IT WOULD BE TRUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE WOULD NEED AND DEPEND ON REGIONAL. PARTICIPATION TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT- THAT'S NOT. THAT THE BOARD HAS GONE BEFORE BECAUSE WE REALLY DO LIKE TO LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND OF FACULTY THEY HAVE NO THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THEY SERVE. IN REALLY THE NEEDS OF THAT COMMUNITY AND BASED ON THEIR INPUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S VAST WHICH YOU HAVE IN IMPERIAL VALLEY DOWN HERE NEXT TO THE BORDER. IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU HAVE ND WHY RICA OR BUY SELL YEAH OR EVEN LA AND SO YOU WANT TO HAVE THOSE SCHOOLS TO SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. AND OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS HAVE THAT INNATE INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INPUT IT'S GREAT TO GET THAT INPUT. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR NEW ACTOR THAT NURSING EDUCATION WORKFORCE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAN LOOK AT AND WE CAN PUT SOMETHING FORWARD THAT'S EVIDENCE BASE AS YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET ANYTHING DEREGULATION IN ANYTHING IN THE STATUTE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EVIDENCE BASED. AND SO WHEN WE DO OUR REGULATORY CHANGE WHICH WE DIDN'T VOTE- AS A WARD IN NOVEMBER TO UPDATE SIXTEEN CC ARE FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX WHICH IS THE REQUIRED CURRICULUM. THAT WILL BE ABLE TO UPDATE THAT AND I THINK WE CAN GIVE YOU WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR SENATOR ROCKS I THINK IT IS TIME AND THAT'S WHAT OUR NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING AGREEING TO. IT'S TIME TO DO A REVAMP OF NURSING EDUCATION AND SEE WHAT WE CAN ALIGN AND DO TOGETHER. WELL I'LL SAY THIS I MEAN IF. I WOULD BE CAN. ABOUT THE PORT. AND MOBILITY OF OUR- NURSING- CADRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF THERE THAT MANY DIFFERENCES IN THE NURSING CURRICULA FROM THE TOP OF THE STATE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STATE BUT FOR THE NATIONAL EXAM WHICH MUST BE THE LEVELING FORCE HERE TO MAKE SURE. THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S TRAINED AT HUMBOLDT OR SOME OTHER OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN MIGRATE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN PERFORM EFFECTIVELY IN THE WORKPLACE BUT THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSES I JUST HAVE. A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORK FORCE MANAGEMENT SCHOOL APPROVALS THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I KNOW THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING UTILIZES ECONOMICS AND WORK FORCE OF. A DATA IN ITS DECISION MAKING PROCESS BUT I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT SO. I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT FACTORS ARE UTILIZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN EXISTING PROGRAM. NURSING PROGRAM THAT IT SHOULD BE APPROVED FOR EXPANSION OR NOT SO WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A DIRECTOR'S HAND BUT WITHIN THAT DIRECTORS HELM BUT IT ALLOWS THE PROCESS AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO SEE CONGRESS OF STANHOPE CHANGE. SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE- ALSO INCORPORATE ENROLLMENT INCREASES SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENROLLMENT INCREASE THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT DO THEY HAVE FACULTY SUPPORT THIS CLINICAL SITES TO SUPPORT THIS YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT DO THEY HAVE BUDGETS FOR THE ONLY GETTING IT BUDGETED BY COVERING IT WITH GRANTS THE GRANTS CAN SOMEONE GOING YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. IF IT IS COVERED BY GRANTS DOES THAT PROGRAM HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO COVER THE FUNDING IMPACT GOING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY DO THEIR CLASSROOM SPACE IF IT'S A BRICK AND MORTAR CAMPUS AND YOU WANT TO ROLL A HUNDRED STUDENTS DO YOU HAVE A CLASSROOM THAT WILL SUPPORT A HUNDRED STUDENTS- IF YOU DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER LAB THAT WILL SUPPORT A HUNDRED STUDENTS DO YOU HAVE A LIBRARY RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT A HUNDRED STUDENTS- ARE YOU IN A FINANCIALLY GOOD STANDING. DO WE NEED THAT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY DOES THE COMMUNITY NEED THAT ARE YOU A COMMUNITY LIKE LA OR SAN DIEGO THAT IS SATURATED WITH THE WORK FORCE THAT DOES NOT HAVE CLINICAL SITE. AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER SCHOOL THERE OR ARE YOU IN BUY SELL YEAH OR MORE OR READ WHERE YOU'RE LIKE I OUR VIEW. I ABSOLUTELY NEED MORE STUDENTS I NEED SOME ASSISTANCE HERE ARE YOU THAT AREA THAT NEEDS THIS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IT'S A REALLY BREAKING IT DOWN. FROM THE SCHOOL THEY ATTEND THEY- REACH OUT TO THE NURSING EDUCATION IS OFTEN SAY HEY I'M LOOKING AT A ROMAN INCREASE WHAT I HAVE TO DO WE WALK THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO GRAB THAT ALL OF THE DATA. TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT BACK IS THERE AND WHEN A STUDENT ENROLLED IN THAT PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE. ASK THE EXPERTS AND GET A JOB WE WANT THERE TO BE ABLE TO REPAY THEIR FINANCIAL AID WE WANT. THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED I THIS AND NOW YOU LOOK AT THE- INSTITUTES. ONLY 82% OF THE STUDENTS SCHOOL STUDENTS SORRY THANK A NURSE PRO. ARE ABLE TO PASS AND CLICKS ON THE FIRST TIME NATIONWIDE. SO THAT MEANS IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT MEANS EIGHTEEN OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO PASS ON THE FIRST TIME THAT MEANS NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY SORRY THE NATIONAL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING SAYS YOU CAN'T RETAKE FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS YOU NEED TO GO BACK IN THE MEDIA THAT'S THREE MORE MONTHS IF THIS PERSON DOESN'T HAVE INCOME. AND IS NOW% INCREASING MORE BURDEN TO THEIR FAMILY AND SO WE WANT TO BE ON TOP OF THAT SO WE ASK THOSE QUESTIONS THEY PROVIDE AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THEY SHOW THE DOCUMENTS THEY TURNED THAT INTO THEIR NEC WE THEN PUT THAT ON THE CALENDAR THE BOARD IS ABLE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS AROUND THAT. AND MAKE A GREAT DETERMINATION AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT OUR BOARD JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN NEW STUDENTS SLOTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHICH THAT MEANS IF IT'S A TWO YEAR PROGRAM. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS COMING OUT OF THAT PROGRAM IF IT'S A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM YOU QUADRUPLE THAT SO THEY HEARD THAT THEY APPROVED FIVE NEW PROGRAMS LAST YEAR FOR NEW CAMPUS LOCATIONS AND FOURTEEN ENROLLMENT INCREASES AND ACCEPTED BY MORE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR NEW PROGRAMS TO SAY HEY. I THINK I CAN RUN A NURSING PROGRAM LET ME SHOW YOU HOW WE CAN AND THEY'RE MOVING THROUGH THE PIPELINE IT'S AN AMAZING DAY TO REALLY SEE THAT OUR BORDERS RESPONSE INTO THE WORK FORCE NEEDS AND THEY'RE GETTING THE STUDENTS TO THEIR SCHOOLS THROUGH THEIR CREATING NEW STUDENT SLOTS AND WERE ABSOLUTELY HAVING EFFECT. AND ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THOSE- PLACEMENTS OCCURRED IN BOSTON- YEAH THE OCCURRED IN IMPERIAL THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN FLIGHT SO THEY'RE TRULY LOOKING AT THE AREAS THAT NEED THIS AND THEY'RE. GROWING INTO THAT WE HAD A FEW PEOPLE- GET CAMP APPROVAL IN PROGRAM APPROVALS ON. WHEN I MET WITH CHF THEY SAID THERE WAS BIG MEDIA AND ONTARIO IN THAT AREA FOR NEW NURSES AND I WAS ABLE TO SAY GREAT. ARIZONA COLLEGE WAS ONE OF OUR COLLEGES TO KEEP YOUR WE JUST APPROVE THAT AS A BSN PROGRAM AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENTS EACH YEAR AND ROLLED INTO THEIR PROGRAM. IT'S A THREE YEAR PROGRAM THEY'LL HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM THAT PROGRAM ON A THREE YEAR BASIS- GOING OUT AND SERVING THAT COMMUNITY. HELLO YEAH. WARRIOR THIS I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH ALL OF THE- BRICK AND MORTAR CAPABILITY CLINICAL PLACEMENT CAPABILITY FACULTY SIZE AND QUALIFICATIONS. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TYPICALLY. FACTORS THAT- THAT AN ACCREDITOR OR APPROVAL AGENCY WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IN DECIDING WHETHER A MEDICAL SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ACCREDITED OR APPROVED OR A- PHARMACY SCHOOL OR- CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOL OR YOU GO DOWN THE LIST DENTAL SCHOOL. IN THIS CASE DOES THE BOARD USED USE FORECASTED SUPPLY OF NURSES IN OTHER WORDS ECONOMIC FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPROVE OR DENY. NEW SCHOOL OR MORE APPROPRIATELY THE EXPANSION OR NOT OF AN EXISTING SCHOOL AND IF SO WHY. WHAT YOU'RE ON MUTE. THANK YOU- WE ACTUALLY LEVERAGE THE REPORT FROM UCSF WE DO A WORK FORCE REPORT EVERY TWO YEARS AND WE DO A SCHOOL REPORT ANNUALLY AND WE PUT THOSE TOGETHER AND PRESENT THAT TO OUR BOARD AND THEY'RE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WHAT IS HAPPENING WE ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT OUR SCHOOL SUBMIT TO US THEY MIGHT FIND ADDITIONAL DATA OUT THERE. THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE BOARD MEMBERS WILL AT THAT POINT SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO MAKE A DECISION TODAY I'M GOING TO DEFER ACTION CAN YOU COME BACK IN OUR BOARD MEETING NEXT MONTH WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO THAT I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION AND UR BOARD HAS NOT DENIED A SINGLE ENROLLMENT INCREASE REQUEST A NEW PROGRAM OR PRESS. REQUEST FOR A NEW CAMPUS LOCATION REQUEST SINCE I WENT BACK TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN FORWARD- AND SO THEY ARE TRULY LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN IT'S NEEDED AND MAKING THESE APPROVAL. SO THERE ARE SCHOOLS CAN BETTER SERVE. WELL I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WELL LET ME ASK A PRELIMINARY QUESTION MY R. BACKGROUND PAPER SAYS THAT WE HAVE FORTIN 580-001-0060 FIVE ACTIVELY LICENSED REGISTERED NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ASSUME THAT'S CORRECT SO DOES THE BOARD NO OR DOES YOUR STUDY REFLECT HOW MANY OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND LICENSED NURSES ARE STILL IN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF NURSING OR HOW MANY HAVE. RETIRED OR DECIDED TO STAY HOME OR HAVE FOUND JOBS IN OTHER FIELDS OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD OF NURSING YET HAVE MAINTAINED AN ACTIVE LICENSE. SO THE GREAT THING IS WE WON THEM ALL OF THAT DATA REALLY SOON THAT LEGISLATORS PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT GAVE THAT INFORMATION OVER THROUGH DC AIRPORTS ACROSS TO H. HIGH. AND SO H. KAISE DEVELOPING THAT ANY NURSE ANY HEALING ART TOWARD ANY RENEWAL OF THE LICENSE TO COLLECT THAT DATA TO FIND OUT ARE YOU GAINFULLY EMPLOYED ARE YOU DECIDING TO. RETIRE AND SO THAT WAS JUST PASSED IN JANUARY OF THIS LAST YEAR AND GIVEN TO H. FIVE AND H. FIVE WILL BE GIVING US THAT INFORMATION FOR ALL OF THE DCA WHITE BOARDS AND GIRLS ARE AFFECTED BY THAT WELL THEN I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING FORECASTED SUPPLY OF NURSES. OR ECONOMIC FACTORS BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME YOU HAVE THAT NEW DATA AND ANALYZE IT. IN MAKING THIS WHETHER TO APPROVE OR DENY EXPANSIONS OR NEW PROGRAMS. SO THE GREAT THING IS THEY BASE THAT ON THE REPORTS THAT WE DID AND SO WHEN THEY WERE H. TIE WS DOING A PRESENTATION. DEC EIGHT ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO COME AND PRESENT BECAUSE OUR BORDERS BUT IT WAS MODEL LOT. SO YES WE ARE ABSOLUTELY USING THAT DATA CURRENTLY IT IS COLLECTED THROUGH OUR UCSF CONTRACT THAT WE JUST RENEWED LAST JUNE. AND BASED ON THE CSA AUDIT RECOMMENDATION THE HOW WE CAN DO OUR PRE LICENSURE PROGRAM APPROVAL BETTER. THEY RECOMMENDED THAT WE GET DOWN TO THE REGIONAL WATER LEVEL THAT WAS ADDED TO OUR CONTRACT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AT THE DATA TO GET IT DOWN TO REGIONAL LEVEL LEVEL VERSUS JUST HAVING IT STAY RIGHT. WELL IF WE HAVE IT STATEWIDE THAN WHAT. WHAT'S THE NUMBER IF IT'S NOT FOUR HUNDRED AND 580-001-0060 FIVE WHAT NUMBER. OF ACTIVE OF ACTIVELY LICENSED NURSES. DO WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF NURSING. IN ONE NURSING. CAPACITY OR THE OTHER. I CAN REACH OUT TO YOUR CONTRACTED PERSON TO GET THAT DATA AND GET IT BACK TO CENTER. I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE I CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT DATA FOR YOU. WELL I MEAN. WHAT CAUSES MY CONCERN IS TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO OTHER. LICENSED PROFESSION WITH THE EXCEPTION PERHAPS OF THE VOCATIONAL NURSES NO OTHER LICENSED PROFESSION USES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ECONOMIC FACTORS VACANCY ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO APPROVE PROGRAMS OR TO APPROVE OR DENY EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS EXCEPT YOU AND THE OTHER- THE OTHER OCCUPATION I MENTIONED. AND SO I GUESS I'M WONDERING WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THE NURSING PROFESSION THAT CAUSES YOU TO WANT TO DO THAT AS A AS A FIELD YOU BEING THE BOARD. NUMBER ONE- CAN THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHY NOT WHAT ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE MARKET PLACE DICTATE THE SIZE AND SUCCESS OF NURSING TRAINING PROGRAMS WHAT GIVES THE BORDER THE STATE. THE RIGHT THE ENTITLEMENT TO REACH DOWN AND TELL ENTITIES THAT WANT TO TRAIN NURSES THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE OUR STUDY INDICATES WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE NURSES. SO I'LL TRY TO CLARIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT- FOR YOU THERE WE DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE THE WORK FORCE NEEDED IS NOT NEEDED IN LA THAT WE MORE GROUP WHEN THEY BRING INFORMATION TO US OUR BOARD LOOKS AT THAT INFORMATION AND IN FACT WE'VE APPROVED SEVERAL SCHOOLS JUST THIS LAST YEAR. FOR LA IN ORANGE COUNTY I HAVE THREE SCHOOLS RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT A LADY IN A INCREASE IN ORANGE COUNTY INCREASED ACTUALLY BY SCHOOLS IN LA. AND SO WITH THAT YOU IT'S NOT BASED SOLELY ON WORKFORCE NEED- BUT THERE ARE STATISTICS OUT THERE THAT SHOW THAT A PERSON THAT GOES TO SCHOOL REALLY WANTS TO BE EMPLOYED WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF WHERE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND STAYED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND SERVE THAT COMMUNITY. WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RECESSION HIT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IS NURSING STUDENTS WERE GRADUATING AND THEY WERE HAVING TO MOVE TO ALASKA TO GET JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA NEVER MOVED TO KENTUCKY TO GET JUST. GIVE ME JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT YOU GOT NURSES GRADUATING SCHOOL PASSING IT COLLECTS AND THEY CANNOT GET EMPLOYEE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS ALWAYS KIND OF IN THE BACK BURNER THAT YOU WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. KNOWING THAT THE DATA SUPPORTS OF THE STATEMENT FIFTY MILES OF WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL BUT ADDITIONALLY YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS THE CLINICAL IMPACTION THAT'S TRULY THE NUMBER ONE INDICATOR AND ALSO LET ME DIRECT I DON'T. I DON'T. I DON'T. PLEASE I DON'T DISAGREE THAT CLINICAL PLAY. ARE FACTOR DIDN'T SAY THAT. LET'S MICHAEL. IS WHY DO YOU CONSIDER A WORK FORCE ANALYSIS. AND SUPPLY OF NURSES OR NOT IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS WHEN NO OTHER OCCUPATION APPEARS TO BE DOING THAT. AND FRANKLY IF WE APPLIED YOUR STANDARD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING OUTCOME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ONLY AND ROLL THOSE PEOPLE. WHO WERE WORKING OR TRAINING FOR JOBS WHERE JOBS EXISTED WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE. SO THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT THAT'S THE EVIDENCE THAT SAYS WHY THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER THERE'S NOT A ONE AND DONE ANSWER FOR THIS IT IS A MUCH MORE ROBUST. AND VERY DIFFICULT. TACTIC TO EVEN LOOK AT WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE AB TEN FIFTEEN WAS ASKED FOR YOU GUYS THIS LAST YEAR THEY GAVE THE BOARD THE SPECIFIC DIRECTION IN BPC TWENTY. SEVENTEEN SO LOOK AT THIS TO FIND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS TO FIND. ANSWER FOR ALL OF THIS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE OUR SCHOOLS EXPAND AS NEEDED TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT JUST LIKE WE DO WITH- PRIVATE COLLEGES ARE LOOKED OUT WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR CREDIT EACH AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR FUNDING. COMMUNITY COLLEGE- LOOKED AT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY YOU CAN GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT ARE THOSE STUDENTS ABLE TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S THE KEY YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE WALKING AROUND WITH THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND A DEGREE. I CAN'T GET A JOB SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE IN ALL OF THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE TRULY ABLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND OUR STUDENTS ARE PUBLIC AS WELL AND SO YOU WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AFTERWARDS SO THAT IS ONLY A PARTIAL CONSIDERATION THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A LOOK AT. WELL I LISTEN I ABSOLUTELY RESPECT WHAT YOU AND- THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD AND YOUR STAFF TO EACH AND EVERY DAY WITH RESPECT TO NURSING EDUCATION AND NURSING LICENSURE IN THE STATE. I WOULD LIKE TO- HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME INPUT FROM YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE CLEARLY APPEARS TO BE. EITHER A DISCONNECT OR SOME STRANGE ANOMALY IN THE MARKET PLACE NOW WERE. HOSPITALS ARE FILLED WITH TRAVELLING NURSES. HOSPITAL CEOS COMPLAIN ABOUT SHORTAGES OF NURSES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO SECURE. NURSES TO FILL SHIFTS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE NURSING RATIOS. THAT ABSENT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER NEED TO BECOME WITH. SO I LOOK FOR TO HAVING A CONTINUE KIND. WITH YOU ON ON THESE ISSUES THE APPROVAL CRITERIA HOW THOSE FIT IN WITH SCHOOLS AND WHETHER SCHOOL SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPAND OR NOT. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR RESPONSES. TO MIKE POINTED QUESTIONS AND I HOPE THEY WERE TOO POINTED. LET ME LET ME TURN IT BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF- IF THEY HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE OR COMMENTS BEFORE I. I GO TO- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC JERRY BERMAN THANK YOU CHAIR OFTEN BY THE PATIENT BY THE WAY AND I. NO IT'S BEEN GREAT AND I'VE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW EVERY TIME I THINK I'VE GOT A QUESTION THAT GETS ANSWER GETS ASKED- SO IT'S A REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD MORE YOU APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS. I HAVE JUST GOT ONE QUESTION THAT'S AS KIND OF A SUBSET OF A QUESTION ANSWER ROTH RAISED- RELATED ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN IN EDUCATION PROGRAM APPROVAL ONE CONCERN THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM. A LOT OF PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOLS IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN WHAT CONSTITUTES A MAJOR OR MINOR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE. FOR EVERY APPLICATION I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR OFF OF THE TWO THAT THE STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AT THE- YOU KNOW THAT THE BOARD IS IN- DOES THE B. R. AND HAVE GUIDELINES THEY CAN SHARE- WITH SCHOOLS TO HELP CLARIFY. WHAT MAJOR VERSUS MINOR MEANS. YEAH WE HAVE THAT IT'S CALLED THE DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK. WE SHARED THAT AN UPDATE BACK ANNUALLY FOR THEM IT IS BASED ON OUR REGULATIONS WE DO HAVE A CURRENT REGULATORY PACKAGE THAT IS THE ACT AWAY ALL. THAT WE RECEIVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT WILL BE ADDRESSING. AND THAT ADDRESSES THE TWO REGULATIONS THAT WE UPDATED THAT PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON THAT. AND THAT IS FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS AND FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO CHANGES TO AN APPROVED PROGRAM. SO ONCE THOSE REGULATIONS ARE CLEARED THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THE STEPS WE GOT THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. THE EYESORE AND THAT THAT EPISODE OURS WELL THE FINAL STEPHEN REASONS ALL THERE IT IS WITH A WAY OUT. WE DID GET GO OUT FOR COMMENTS WERE WORKING ON ADDRESSING THOSE AND THAT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW. OUR BOARD OPERATES SOLELY UNDER REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY SO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE YOU ARE PROGRAM DIRECTORS. WE HAVE TO BE ALIGNMENT BALL THOSE LAWS. AND SO WE'RE UPDATING OUR REGULATIONS TO BE MORE CLEAR. AND WE ARE UPDATING THAT WITHIN OUR DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK INSTILLS THE REGULATIONS. ARE PASSED BY THE TIME WE DO THAT YOU. ADDITION OF THE DIRECTORS HAVE. THAT WILL BE AS WELL- BUT ARE ANY SEES ARE VERSED IN THIS AREA EXPERTS IN THIS AREA AND THEY WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THOSE PROGRAM DIRECTORS. YOU REALLY SEE CAN WE DO THIS AS A MINOR CREEK MORE VISION OR DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MAJOR CURRICULUM VISIONS AND THE MAJORITY OF TIME IT'S MINOR. AND SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING THAT'S APPROVED BY THE NEC BROUGHT FORTH AS OUR BOARD TO ACT AS A CONSENT AGENDA ITEM. AND IT GOES THROUGH THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AT THEIR SCHOOL- WITHOUT. IT'S A IT'S A GREAT PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND WE CAN DEFINITELY IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC PROGRAM DIRECTORS ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS. OR ANY SEES CAN REACH OUT TO THEM AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT WE ARE UPDATING OUR REGULATIONS. GREAT THANK YOU AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE IS CODIFIED IN STATE LAWS THE MINIMUM IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON ON LOWERING THAT MINIMUM- IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS DEEM AS NECESSARY WE- WE- MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE LEGISLATOR TELLS US THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE ASKING IF NOT THE SUNSET SO WE CAN HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS TO DO THAT IT'S UP TO YOU GUYS TO TELL US WHAT WE COULD DO. SO WITH THAT IF YOU GUYS DECIDE TO BE DECREASED IS NEEDED. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS BUT WHAT I CAN SHOW YOU. WANTED TO USE A CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS JANICE FOR LAST YEAR. WE HAD FOR REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETINGS. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE ITEMS THAT GO THROUGH GO AS MINOR CREEK REVISIONS PROGRESS FRIEND WITH. PROGRESS REPORTS AND DO NOT HAVE A FEE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT ALL. SO IT IS ONLY A FEW. THAT COME THROUGH AS A MAJOR CORPORATION THAT EVEN HAS THAT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE WITH THAT BECAUSE- ANY SEASONS WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THOSE PROGRAM DIRECTOR TO SAY. YOU'RE JUST CHANGING THIS IF YOU'RE JUST WORKING N THIS. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AS A MINOR CORPORATION. GRAIL SPEAKING. THANK THE- BIRTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO BERMAN CALLINGS IN FURTHER COMMENTS CONCERNS I SEE NO MIKE'S JUMPING UP INTO THE AIR SO. LET'S NOW- ACCEPT TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING BEGINNING WITH WITNESSES HERE IN THE GALLERY ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY WISH TO TESTIFY BOARD BUT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING I SEE. NO MOVEMENT IN THAT AREA LET'S NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT ANY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING WE WILL. BEGIN. MODERATOR. I PUT HIM TO SLEEP. MR MARTIN MISTER OR MS MODERATOR. IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME. PERFECTLY. THANK YOU WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT IN Q. I AM TWENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. PLEASE PROCEED. LINE TWENTY SIX LINE TWENTY SIX. WELL TRY LINE FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. I PUT THEM ALL TO SLEEP NINE FOUR ZERO. NINE FIFTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. LINE FIFTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD I'M SORRY FIFTY SEVEN. HE. NINE FORTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME PERFECTLY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS WENDY HAMPER- AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF NURSING AT. STATE UNIVERSITY IN SAN MARCOS. I WOULD LIKE. TO QUICK ISSUES. ONE IS THE COMMENT REGARDING CLINICAL SIMULATION WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED MORNING. ARE THESE THE CLINICAL SIMULATION IS NOW A COMMON AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE SECTION. BEEN TESTED TICKET ONLY DURING THE COPA NINETY PANDEMIC. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE A VALUABLE TEACHING STRATEGIES THAT ALIGN. WITH AN EFFECTIVELY PREPARES FOR DIRECT PATIENT CARE. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO USE VALIDATED. SIMULATION EXPERIENCES ARE MORE DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE BRN. DEVELOP GUIDELINES THE POLICY THE PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS THAT ALIGN WITH THE LACE AND NATIONAL STANDARD. THE BOARD NEEDS TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES AS TO THE NUMBER OF DIRECTLY TO CARE CLINICAL HOURS TOGETHER WITH THE TYPE OF RELATION EXPERIENCE. THAT ARE NEEDED FOR A PRACTICE OF LAW THAT YOU PRE LICENSURE ARE IN GRADUATE. MY SECOND COMMENT IS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CONCURRENCY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY. ADVOCATES REQUIRED TO HAVE CLINICAL AND CLASSROOM LEARNING OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS DR CAN YOU HELP ME AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CFU DIRECTOR OF NURSING REGARDING FACULTY AND CLINICAL APPROVAL. WE HOLD THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FOR NURSING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE IN OUR TWENTY NURSING PROGRAM AND WE WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT THE REDUNDANT PAPERWORK AND LEVEL OF APPROVAL THAT WOULD NOT GO TO JIFFY CLINICAL PLACEMENT AND FACULTY APPROVALS FROM B. R. N. IT IS THE NURSING DIRECTORS AND THEIR FACULTY WHO ARE REPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING PROGRAMS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE IRAN REGULATIONS. WHILE ALSO PREPARING FUTURE NURSING WORKFORCE. CURRENTLY THE NURSING PROGRAMS CAN NOT YOU KNOW LIKE CLINICAL EXPERIENCES. WITHOUT PRIOR. APPROVAL THE SAME IS TRUE FOR NEW FACULTY HIRED TO TEACH. OR CLINICAL COURSEWORK. PROGRAMS OFTEN HIRE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CLINICAL FACULTY EVERY YEAR AND SOMETIMES THIS HAS TO BE AT THE LAST MINUTE. POLITICAL CURRENCY IT ALSO NARROWLY DEFINED AS ACUTE CARE OFTEN DISMISSING THE CLINIC AND OUTPATIENT SETTING WHERE MANY ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES WORK. THE CSU STRONGLY ADVOCATE FOR LAST THIRTY SOME PROCESSES WHICH WE DID NOT. ADD NOTHING UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK IF YOU'RE IN NEED TO RE DEFINE THE PROCESS FOR FACULTY AND CLINICAL SITE APPROVAL. AND ELIMINATE REDUNDANT PAPERWORK IN PUBLIC APPROVAL I CAN DELAY IN HIRING AND THE CLINICAL THANK ONBOARDING PROCESSES. WE UNDERSTAND THERE NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A CHECK AND BALANCE. IT CAN PUT IN PLACE. WE SUGGEST GIVING UP AND GUIDE TO FOLLOW THANK YOU PLACE MUST BE WITH. AGENT HOT THAT ARE LICENSED IN CAL HEALTHCARE. BUT THE ISSUE ONLY PARTNERS WITH CONTRACTED AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS THAT ARE LICENSED HEALTHCARE FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA. OF NOTE. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS OF NURSING MEMBER PROFILE DATA. EIGHT THAT 78% OF THE BOARD OF NURSING DO NOT ACCRUE CLINICAL PLACEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMENTS THE MODERATOR NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU NINE FORTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. LINE FORTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS DEBRA WILSON I AM THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE NURSING PROGRAMS AT CSU BAKERSFIELD AND SPEAKING ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CSU DIRECTORS OF NURSING. WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK REGARDING ALLOWING NURSING PROGRAMS TO REVISE CERTAIN CLINICAL EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR. EIGHTY FIFTEEN THIRTY TO FIFTEEN THIRTY TO ALLOW SUPPORTERS BOARD NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANTS TO APPROVE A REQUEST FROM APPROVED NURSING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN CLINICAL EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER IT EXPIRES AT THE END OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR. MANY NURSING AND PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IN SECURING VARIOUS CLINICAL PLACEMENT ESPECIALLY IN THE NURSING SPECIALTY AREAS LIKE PEDIATRIC AND PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSING IN THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR. HOUSE WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THIS IS DUE TO CLINICAL PLACEMENT SITES LIMITING AND RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PLACED IN A FACILITY UNDER CLINICAL FACULTY SUPERVISION. THE PANDEMIC. BACK TO THE STUDENT RATE RATIOS WERE TYPICALLY ONE TO TWELVE PROVIDES A TEN FOOT CAN HELP MAKE MOST CLINICAL SITES HAVE LIMITED THEIR CLINICAL PLACEMENT- RATIOS. TWO ONE SIX EIGHT FOUR ONE TWO SIX I'VE EVEN EXPERIENCED AS LOW AS ONE TO FOUR IN THE PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH AREA. THE SECRETIVE AND FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY AND DRIVE UP THE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS NEEDED TO PROGRESS. THIRTY STUDENTS IN THEIR STUDY. THIS ISSUE IS THERE ANY COST HOW SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND THE CAMPUS OF CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO. FOR A REQUEST FOR A REVISED A CLINICAL EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT TO RECEIVE APPROVAL CURRENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE NURSING PROGRAMS TO CONTACT EVERY POSSIBLE CLINICAL FACILITY AND A TWENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS TO VERIFY THAT THERE IS NO AVAILABILITY FOR STUDENT PLACEMENTS. THIS PROCESS IS AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN FOR THE NURSING PROGRAMS. OUR FOCUS NEEDS TO BE UNSUCCESSFULLY TRAINING NURSING STUDENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY REGARDING CHECKS AND BALANCES- BUT THE NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADMINISTER PROGRAMS FCPA COMPLIANCE WHILE ALSO PREPARING THE SEARCH FEATURE NURSING WORKFORCE THE CSU STRONGLY ADVOCATES FOR A LESS BURDEN BURDENSOME PROCESS. WHICH DOES NOT ADD UNNECESSARY AND TIME INTENSIVE PAPERWORK OR CALLING EVERY CLINICAL PLACEMENT FIGHT WITHIN A TWENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS TO NO AVAIL. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMENTS MODERATOR NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU TERM MEMBER THERE BUT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICT WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK TO BE ARE AND HAVE BEEN DONE THE PHILOSOPHY THAT REVIEW HEARING. SOMEONE OFFER A FEW COMMENTS OR ANY CONCERNS ALL TYPES OF HEALTHCARE DISTRICT THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN BOTH URAN AND RURAL AREAS HAVE TO BE YOUR WORKFORCE SHORTAGES PARTICULARLY IN NURSING WHICH I'VE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COLD AT NINETEEN POINT THAT MIGHT. BE A DISTRICT RELY EAVILY ON GROWING THEIR FUTURE WORKFORCE TO ENSURE AND PRESERVE ARCTIC HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR MANY DISTRICTS IN THE R. AND INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF REGULATION WORKERS OFTEN LOCKED OPPORTUNITIES TO STAND UP NEW EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. OR EXPAND EXISTING PROGRAM WITH 50% THE HARBOR THERE IS VERY LITTLE FLEXIBILITY TO STAND UP PROGRAMS IN UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITY. HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS ARE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE CREATION OF PROPERLY TRAINED WORKFORCE BUT YOU NEED REGULATIONS I CAN BETTER ABOUT NOT ALL COMMUNITIES AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OR EVEN THE REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS MAY NOT MEET THE REGULAR REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE R. AND THEREFORE CANNOT RECEIVE CLINICAL PLACEMENT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF NURSE BUT- WE BELIEVE THAT TO MEET THE ONGOING DEMAND WE NEED TO EXTEND FLEXIBILITY IN AREAS SUCH AS SIMULATED OUR- CURRENCY AND BURGER REQUIREMENT. ADDITIONALLY WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE OUR ETHNIC THE DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK WIDELY AVAILABLE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS REALLY RIGHT THEMSELVES WITH THE ONGOING REQUIREMENTS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS NURSING SHORTAGES AND THEIR ABILITY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS. THE BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE AND MORE ABOUT NURSING WORKFORCE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND. YOUR TIME MODERATOR NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU I HAVE FURTHER. THING YOU AT THE TIME. THANK YOU THE MODERATOR. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTION COME IN OR- I SEE. NO MIKE. IN THE AIR SO. WE'LL WRAP UP THIS PORTION OF. PRESIDENT TRUJILLO AND MISS MEL B. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU AND- THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING DO FOR ALL OF THE REST OF US- SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION- MISS MEL B. YOU GET TODAY. TODAY OF FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND PUTTING A TWIST ON IT AND PUTTING UP WITH ME SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT IRAQ. THANK YOU SENATOR RON. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW BEGIN A REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL AND WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME. DR JEFFREY FOREMAN BOARD CHAIR- AND I THINK I WILL LET THE REST OF YOUR GROUP- INTRODUCE THEMSELVES FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ROTH CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM DOCTOR JEFFREY FOUR MINUTES WAS JUST STATED AND IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROFESSION AS HEALTH CARE AND FOR PAIN CONTROL AND STRESS REDUCTION HAS BEEN MY LIFE'S WORK. I'M FORMER PROFESSOR AT THE ANZA COLLEGE IN CUPERTINO CALIFORNIA AND- IN THAT CAPACITY I DEVELOPED THE FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGE MASSAGE THERAPY PROGRAMS AND THE FIRST DEGREE IN MASSAGE THERAPY IN CALIFORNIA AND A FEW DIFFERENT CERTIFICATES. I AM PRESENTLY THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL M. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE SCHOOL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ALL OF OUR- C. M. D. C. OF APPROVED SCHOOLS. A UNIQUE. C. M. D. C. IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SUCCESS STORIES OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE A UNIQUE NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION THAT ENCOURAGES COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS C. A. M. P. C. WAS CREATED BY LEGISLATION SIGNED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THE TITLE PROTECTION PROGRAM ALLOWS THE USE OF THE TERM CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST AND CERTIFIED MASSAGE PRACTITIONER. THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE IS WELL VETTED MASSAGE PROFESSIONAL WHO'S BEEN EDUCATED IT IS C. A. M. P. C. YOU APPROVE SCHOOL. IN IS IDENTIFIED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NUMBER AND THEIR ABILITY TO PRACTICES TIED TO THEM CONFORMING TO LEGAL BEHAVIOR. LICENSURE FOR MASSAGE THERAPY WAS CONSIDERED. IN THE COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION OF THE INITIAL LEGISLATION AND HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY DEBATED AND REJECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN INDEPENDENT FEASIBILITY STUDY SAID SPECIFICALLY THE C. A. M. P. C. IS A SUPERIOR MODEL TO LICENSURE DELINEATED LICENSURE IS MORE EXPENSIVE A RECENT FEES STUDY DONE OUR SHOWS THAT LICENSURE WOULD BE FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR- ARE THE MASSAGE THERAPIST IN WOULD ACTUALLY EXCEED A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS WAS SO ABLY WRITTEN BY THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CONSULTANT C. A. M. P. C. IS ABLE TO ACCESS REMOTELY FLEXIBLY AND INEXPENSIVELY IN ITS OPERATIONS. ACTUALLY WHEN COMPARED TO AN ALL I GUESS BOARDS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. MANY DCA BOARDS AROUND THE VERGES OF INSOLVENCY AT THIS POINT IN TIME RECIENTE C. HAS A BALANCED BUDGET AND MORE THAN SIX MONTHS OF CASH RESERVES. PERFORMANCE METRICS D. C. A. BOARDS WE'VE COMPARED THEM CAN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO C. A. M. P. C.'S ABILITY TO SWIFTLY ANSWER PHONE CALLS ASSIST CERTIFICATE HOLDERS ISSUED NEW AND RENEWAL CERTIFICATES IN DISCIPLINE VIOLATORS OF THE ETHICAL AND LEGAL STANDARDS OF PRACTICING CARE. PERHAPS THE DIFFERENCE IS NEVER MORE STRONGLY REALIZED THEN IN A STATEMENT BY OUT OF STATE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN ADVOCATING FOR LICENSURE THEY- BEHIND THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND PROSTITUTION I'M NOT THE BUSINESS OF A BODY REGULATING MASSAGE. C. A. M. P. C. CONSIDERS THE EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO BE THE CORE OF ITS MISSION AND MANDATE FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO CLOSE SCHOOLS THAT PROVIDE THE DIPLOMAS. THAT ARE PAID FOR AND NO EDUCATION IS PROVIDED THAT HE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS UTILIZE THIS. THIS AVENUE TO TRY TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR- WORKERS THE C. A. M. P. C. SCHOOL APPROVAL PROCESS IS A MODEL THAT MANY STATES ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY ADOPTING. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE SUPPORT FOR C. A. M. P. C. IS FAR REACHING AND DEEPLY ROOTED. THE STRONGEST ADVOCATES FOR C. A. M. D. C. R. GROUPS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND SISTERS OF CHARITY OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. WHO SUBSCRIBE TO COMMENTS BY THE SAN FRANCISCO COLLABORATIVE AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING A PARTICULARLY WELL SERVED BY C. A. M. P. C.'S OVERSIGHT. AND REGULATION. CMT C. IS SUPPORTED BY MAJOR EMPLOYERS IN THE STATES SUCH AS MASSAGE ENVY M. BURKE WILLIAMS. WHO SUPPORT THE SENSIBILITY INSTRUCTURE BRINGS TO THEIR BUSINESSES. AND C. A. M. P. C. IS SUPPORTED BY POLICE CHIEFS RANK AND FILE OFFICERS. AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO SUPPORT DUE PROCESS YET STRONGLY SUPPORT C. A. M. D. C. TO DO WHAT DCA BOARDS CAN'T. AND THAT IS QUICKLY QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY DISCIPLINE THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAW. WE ALSO COLLABORATE CLOSELY AS WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES HELPING THEM UPDATE THEIR MASSAGE ORDINANCES. C. A. M. D. C. HAS ELEVATED THE PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I FIRST BEGAN pTEACHING MASSAGE THERAPY IT WAS IN MANY COMMUNITIES CONSIDERED IN THE AREA OF ADULT ENTERTAINMENT. IN MY GRADUATES WERE FORCED TO TAKE VD TESTS. WE HAVE THOSE JACKIE JUST OVER THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE C. M. D. C. HAS ELEVATED OUR STATUS AND WE ARE NOW CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN FACT I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CODE NINETEEN VACCINE WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF THE CFTC STAFF. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A AND- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU THAT FUHRMAN DO. ANY OF YOUR OTHER COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO OFFER BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBER. YES MARTIN'S ZERO MY TECHNOLOGY AND- GENEROSITY. IN GERMAN BERMAN AND- THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'LL TRY TO MAKE MY COMMENTS- BRIEFS- BUT I THINK I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND ON ME- I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M A LICENSED ATTORNEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M CURRENTLY THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO. I AM A C. A M. T. C. BOARD MEMBER. AND AS A POLICE CAPTAIN I SPENT A YEAR UNDER COVER. INFILTRATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION THAT RESULTED IN THE TAKE DOWN OF SEVERAL MONTHS SOLID COLORS THAT WERE ACTING ILLEGALLY. I'M ALSO UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER BECAUSE AS A DEPUTY CHIEF I STOOD IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CHAMBERS. ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO LEGISLATOR INSTITUTING THE C. A. M. P. C. AND I WAS REPRESENTING CAL CHIEFS AT THAT TIME. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU. I WAS WRONG. IN ALL OF YOU. RIGHT CERTAINLY YOUR PREDECESSORS WERE RIGHT ON THIS- IT WAS INGENIOUS- TO CREATE A NEW STRUCTURE THAT WAS MINIMAL YOU CAN FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FACING WITH THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY. THAT HAD LITERALLY BEEN BY CRIMINALS THAT CREATED. A PIPELINE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I GOT TO WITNESS HIS FIRST UP. IN A TELL YOU IT WAS SEEM LESS. THAN TRAGIC. BY CREATING THE C. A. ANTI CD- YOU ALL CREATED IN A NIBBLE LEAD ORGANIZATION THANK YOU GO TO THE VERY HEART OF THE PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT NO STATE BOARD NO CITY IN NO COUNTY COULD EVER DO. AND I SAY THE CREATION OF THE C. M. D. C. WAS INGENIOUS. BECAUSE HE CREATED A FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE THAT FINALLY FINALLY ALLOWED THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT THAT HAD INFILTRATED. THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY IN IT ALLOWED US TO DO IT IN A COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE WAY. THE PROCESS IN PLACE NOW- THE D. C. M. D. C. OUR HOUSE ALLOWS FOR DENIALS IN DISCIPLINE A BAD ACTORS IN A QUICK FASHION AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY. BECAUSE WHITES ARE AT STAKE. IN FINANCIAL GAME FOR CRIMINALS IS JUST TOO GREAT WITHOUT THAT SWEPT IN DECISIVE ACTION. IN FACT I'M A MEMBER OF THE STATE BAR. AND- I HAVE LOOKED AT MANY OTHER- LICENSURE ASSOCIATIONS. AND WHAT TAKES THEM YEARS TO DO IN THE AREA OF DISCIPLINE YEARS WE CNT SEE USUALLY DOES AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE DAYS. THIS ALSO US DCA MP C. TO GO OUT THE TRAFFICKING PIPELINE. THESE WERE THE SHAM SCHOOLS IN THE DIPLOMA MILLS WERE LOCATED. IT WAS INCREDIBLE THE AMOUNT OF- WORK IT TOOK TO ROUTE THOSE OUT AND- IT CERTAINLY. WAS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING PIPELINE. BUT THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH THE SAME SCHOOLS AND THE ORGANIZATIONS COULD NOT BE REPLICATED BY CITIES COUNTIES OR STATE BOARDS. IN THERE IT REALLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE- IN IN- IN OUR TEN YEAR TO ELIMINATE THAT PIPELINE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SO AFTER COUCHES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS UNION G. C. WHICH WE LOST TONIGHT AND I WAS EDUCATED THANK GOODNESS WE DID LOSE AT THAT TIME. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES PUT ME ON THE C. A. M. P. C. BOARD AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE- I MEAN I WAS TRULY THERE TO WAGE A WAR AGAINST THE C. A. M. P. C. BECAUSE- CERTAINLY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT I COULD DO WHAT REPORTED TO DO. AND AND I WAS WRONG AGAIN- I GOTTA TELL YOU THAT- I WAS SO PROUD TO FIND OUT THE DATE- REPRESENTED MY GREATEST DESIRE AND THAT WAS PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO BRING ABOUT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS. THAT WOULD PROMOTE THIS PUBLIC SAFETY SO I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE CMT C. WAS EMBARKING DOWN THE PATH THAT CITIES AND LICENSING BOARDS IN COUNTIES COULD NEVER ACCOMPLISH. AND THAT WAS TO BRING ABOUT COORDINATION COLLABORATION ENFORCEMENT OF STATEWIDE RULES TO THE HEALING ART PROFESSION. AS I MENTIONED- THAT WAS A GREAT THING THAT THE LEGISLATOR DID AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM IN THERE IS NO PROBLEM. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THIS IS THE BEST AFTER FORTY YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS THIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE. SOLUTION AND YOU ARE CREATED- SO I TELL YOU THAT I. SO MY IN FAVOR OF THIS AND I'M PROUD OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATOR DID IN CREATING THE C. M. D. C. AND I'M PROUD TO BE ON THE DIVERSE SPORT. NOW REPRESENTING C. SACK- THIS BOARD IS PROVIDING DEGREE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND BORDER THAT IS REALLY UNPARALLELED. THE C. M. D. C. BOARD MEANS ARE TRANSPARENT OPEN. WE HAVE A VIGOROUS DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN PLACE- WE ARE FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS. ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND IN FACT WE HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS ON. LINE READY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. IN SECONDS THAT I KNOW OF NO OTHER AGENCY THAT DOES THAT. WE ARE SOLVENT WITH THAT AS MENTIONED BEFORE SIX MONTHS OF RESERVES IN A BALANCED BUDGET- IN IT I CAN TELL YOU WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY LICENSING BOARD. TO ACHIEVE THAT WITH OUR- INCREDIBLE BUT WITHOUT AN INCREDIBLE INCREASE IN INTERVIEWS. AND WE LISTEN AND CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT PERFECT BUT WE'RE WILLING TO LISTEN IN ORDER TO GET BETTER I THINK THAT'S THE KEY MARKET ANY. AGENCY SO RIGHT NOW EVERYONE IS ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. WE ARE THERE. WE THERE USED TO BE TO SEE. AND DOUG- IN THE WORK. WE'RE GONNA IN GREAT CHAOS IN THE ENFORCEMENT WHICH I. WORKED ON FIRST HAND THERE IS NOW EXTREME COOPERATION AND COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. AND THERE YOU WILL HAVE OTHER SPEAK AGAINST- THE C. M. D. C. I'M SURE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THEIR MOTIVATION THAT IS KEY BECAUSE OUR MOTIVATION CAN'T BE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH I THINK IS PARAMOUNT FOR THE CONSUMERS AND THE THERAPIST. WHO WANT TO OPERATE IN GENERAL BUSINESS. IN MY OPINION CHANGED THE MODEL THAT YOU ALL CREATED WOULD SEND US BACK TWENTY PLUS YEARS TOOK PLACE WE NEVER WANT TO GO BACK TO. AND THOUGH- I'VE HAD MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA I DON'T SPEAK FOR MYSELF. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC AGENCY THE PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES THAT I HAVE REPRESENTED IN THE PAST. YEARS AND NOW- I REPRESENT- IT IS A COUNTY EXECUTIVE C. SACK. IN FACT- I'VE NEVER IN MY TENURE- SEEN SUCH A DIVERSE COALITION OF GROUPS COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ANYTHING. ANYTHING WE'VE GOT THE POLICE TO SURE UP THE DA'S NGOS CODE COMPLIANCE- DOES IN THE MISSILE DUES IS ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING INDUSTRIES. CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ALL WORKING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME ON ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. C. N. T. HAVE BROUGHT ALL THESE GROUPS TOGETHER TO WORK THROUGH COLLABORATION ON ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH HAS PLAGUED THIS. INDUSTRY FOR DECADES. WE ARE MAKING A GREAT DIFFERENCE THROUGH PRIDE- BITE INTO. MO USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION AND EDUCATION OF THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. WHEN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES FOUND SWIFT AND DECISIVE ACTIONS ARE TAKEN. AND WE ARE FORTUNATE CRIMINALS. OUT OF THIS HI JACK HEALING PROFESSION. AND IT IS B. BECAUSE HE AND HE DELIVERS ON WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY SET OUT TO DO. AND THAT IS TO TAKE BACK THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY FROM THE CRIMINALS. THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT IT WAS LITERALLY. YOU SHOULD ALL BE CONGRATULATED. FOR INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY IN DEVELOPING AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS A RATHER CANYON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IN THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT FROM THE DISK FROM HIS HEALING ARTS PROFESSION WHILE ALSO PROVIDING UNPARALLELED CUSTOMER SERVICE. AN INTERIM WHILE ALSO BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IN DOING SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SIR- ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL WHICH TO MAKE REMARKS BEFORE I GO TO MEMBERS.

THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN AND- CENTER ROCK I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CEO OF- C. A. N. T. C. WAS PAID THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH AN ADDITIONAL 8% ANNUAL RAISE BEING DESCRIBED THIS CAST BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CAN WE HAVE THE EITHER THE ATTORNEY OR THE- BOARD MEMBER- EXPLAIN WHY THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE SALARY CONSIDERING THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS STATED THE MEDIAN SALARY FOR A SIMILAR. REGULATORY AGENCY EXECUTIVE. THE AGENCY USES AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND AND I DID SEE THAT. THEY WERE COMPARING TO CEOS OF THE- CHAMBR AND- THE- MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY. APPROPRIATE COMPARISON BUT MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING. ANY TAKERS. YES YEAH I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE CAN YOU PLEASE ANSWER. I THINK YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE SIR M. I. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW PERFECTLY PLEASE PROCEED. C. M. D. C. WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BUT NONE OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED JUST HAPPENED THEY COME FROM SOMEWHERE C. A. M. P. C. IT ALL STARTS WITH THE STRONG LEADERSHIP OF OUR C. E. L. IS A TRUE VISIONARY WHO GUIDES THE ORGANIZATION WITH A DEFT HAND. WHILE MUCH HAS BEEN MADE ALL OF HIS COMPENSATION I IT'S POLITICAL THEATER TO ME BECAUSE THE BOARD KNOWS WHAT THIS MAN HAS BEEN PAID AND IS BEING PAID YEAH WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING WE GET IT WE HAVE A TIRELESS WORKER. WHO WORKS ON HIS VACATION. I'VE HE'S CALLED. ANY DAY OF THE WEEK DAY OR NIGHT THIS MAN WORKS AND- AND I. HE'S VERY QUALIFIED HE HAS BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AS A THERAPIST INSTRUCTOR AND ENTREPRENEUR. HE BEGAN WORKING ON THE REGULATORY ASPECT OF MASSAGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE ISSUES FACING THIS INDUSTRY. A. N. MASAI'S PROFESSIONALS ED HE EEPS THE ORGANIZATION ON COURSE AND FOCUSED ON HIS MISSION. HE IMPLEMENTS OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES OF THE BOARD. AND HE HAD THE FORETHOUGHT FOR THOUGHT TO FOCUS ON HMAN TRAFFICKING FROM THE BEGINNING EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A POPULAR MOTION WHEN C. A. M. P. C. WAS STARTED. HE WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS FOR NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HE'S CREATED AND STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CITIES COUNTIES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ADVOCATED FOR STRONGER INFORMATION. SHARING PROVISIONS IN THE LAW WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PROMOTE OUR COMBINED INTERESTS. HE HAS WORKED WITH MULTIPLE COUNTY DA'S TO STRENGTHEN COLLABORATION RESULTING IN MEMBER- A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS. HE WORKS EVERY DAY TO ELEVATE THE PROFESSION. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT UNTIL PROSTITUTION IS SEPARATED IN THE MINDS OF THE PUBLIC FROM THE SIZE THE ENTIRE PROFESSION WILL SUFFER. HE TOOK AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ENSURING THE C. A. M. P. C. PROVIDED ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION FOR THE COVERT PANDEMIC. I HAVE. COUNTLESS. MEMORANDUMS WAS SENT OUT TO THE C. A. M. P. C. MEMBERS OF S. THE TICKET HOLDERS AND WE EVEN HAD IT A NATIONAL SPEAKER DR MANY- SPEAK ON A PANEL AND ROOF WARNER SPEAK ON A PANEL- IT'S RING QUESTIONS ABOUT COVERT FOR THE PUBLIC. IN HIS COMPENSATION IS IN LINE WITH WHAT A. M. P. A. M. G. A. PAYS ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND WITH OTHER SIMILARLY SIZED NONPROFITS PAY IS C. E. O.'S. WE DID. HAD A NATIONWIDE CONSULTING FIRM DO A STUDY IN THIS. PACKAGE THAT HE HAS IS WELL WITHIN IRS GUIDELINES FOR NON PROFIT CEO COMPENSATION. SEVEN NUMBER ONE PHONE I JUST JUST BEEN OPENED AND MAYBE IT'S YOU CAN'T BUY I APPRECIATE THE- EXPLANATION BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN THREE AND A HALF ALMOST THREE AND A HALF TIMES THE COMPENSATION FOR A SIMILAR REGULATORY EXECUTIVES AND- I I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING VERY HARD WORK ON DIFFICULT ISSUES ALSO SO. WHAT YOU'RE MIXING APPLES AND ORANGES HE HE HAS SIXTY EMPLOYEES. THAT HE'S HE'S MANAGING OKAY HOW MANY HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT THOSE- THOSE PEOPLE HAVE. I THINK THOSE ARE QUESTIONS WE CAN CERTAINLY ANSWER SIR ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OF SOME OF OUR- ANY FURTHER COMMENTS SIR. OKAY THANK YOU MA'AM SURE BERMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MIGHT HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THAT ISSUE LATER- ITEMS IN MR CALLAGY- YEAH YOU AND I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE LAST FIVE PLUS YEARS AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT I THINK YOU BEING WRONG ON ON THIS ISSUE IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER SEE YOU BE WRONG- SO- THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET EVERYTHING ABOUT A HUNDRED. OR A THOUSAND. FROM ON THE ISSUE OF- I BELIEVE IT WAS. MR FORM MR FOREMAN WHO YOU SAID YOU KNOW THAT THAT YOU'RE HAPPY TO SEE MASSAGE THERAPISTS TO FINALLY BE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE DO YOU CONSIDER MASSAGE THERAPY TO BE HEALING ART. YES I DO I AGREE WITH THAT IT APPEARS FROM STATUTE THAT THAT OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS ON YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ONLY TO HAVE TO BE ACTUAL MASSAGE THERAPISTS WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER HEALING ARTS BOARDS IS THERE A REASON WE SHOULD TREAT MASSAGE THERAPY DIFFERENTLY. IN THIS REGARD. THEIR MANAGER. PLEASE SO- CPC HAS A BOARD OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS. WE HAVE SIX MASSAGE SERVICE IN SEVEN OUR MEMBERS WERE NOT MASSAGE THERAPIST. EIGHTEEN SEE YOU SEE. OF COURSE ONCE THE INPUT OF THE MASSAGE PROFESSION. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SIX MASSAGE THERAPIST ON THE BOARD. OBVIOUS IT WAS VERY COMPLICATED ISSUES A MULTIFACETED ISSUE THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. TO HAVE. A DIVERSE BACKGROUND. IN HAVE GRASS WOULD BE PUT INTO THE BOARDS SO WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF CITIES OR COUNTIES OF POLICE CHIEFS- ENTER YOUR TRAFFICKING REALIZATIONS MASSAGE SCHOOLS- TO MASSAGE ASSOCIATIONS- BUT THAT BEING SAID. IF THE COMMITTEE KILLS THERE- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD AND REASSESS IT. WE ARE ALWAYS THERE TO- TO LISTEN AND THAT THE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS. ONE MORE ISSUE PERTAINING TO. THE SUBJECT OF- OF. OUR PROFESSIONALS ON REGULATORY BOARDS AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE- TO START THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISION ON THAT MATTER BETWEEN- THE NORTH CAROLINA- BOARD OF DENTISTRY A. N- AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION- I'M GONNA ASK ALLISON SIEGEL MAYBE TO ADDRESS ITS REAL QUICKLY. SURE ALMOST IS REFERRING TO- NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS VERSES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER A TWENTY FIFTEEN U. S. SUPREME COURT CASE AND JUST GENERALLY THAT CASE HELD THAT WHEN A STATE REGULATORY BOARD FEATURES A MAJORITY SHARE. OF ACTIVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS ANY ALLEGEDLY ANTI COMPETITIVE DECISION MAKING MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO PARKER ANTITRUST LITIGATION IMMUNITY UNLESS THERE IS QUOTE AN ACTIVE STATE SUPERVISION TO AN END QUOTE TO ENSURE THAT ALL DELEGATED AUTHORITY IS BEING EXECUTED IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC AND NOT THE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THEIR MEMBERS. AND WHY THIS IS REALLY A COMPLICATED LEGAL ISSUE AS TO ITS APPLICABILITY TO SEEING TCD THERE IS A CONCERN- THAT ABOARD ISSUE CAN BE TOO HEAVILY INDUSTRY MOTIVATED. AND HAVE A MAJORITY OF INDUSTRY MEMBERS THEREFORE THIS CONCERN REALLY WEIGHS HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF HAVING BOARDS THAT HAVE LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF INDUSTRY MEMBERS ON THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I DO MY NOTES SHOW THAT THREE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OR MASSAGE THERAPISTS- SO MAYBE MY INFORMATION IS OUTDATED- THE- THE MR NICK NETANEL I BELIEVE YOU SAID SIX MEMBERS ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE DRESSED THAT'S CORRECT WE HAVE SIX MASSAGE THERAPIST GREAT. ONE UP IF YOU COULD- MAYBE PROVIDE US WITH THE UPDATED LIST THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE FANTASTIC APPRECIATE IT. SO COMPLETELY AGREE ON ON THE VALUE OF ENFORCEMENT BEING QUICK AND NIMBLE GOD CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE COUNCIL'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS WHICH I UNDERSTAND. IS VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT WHO ALTERNATELY REVIEWS A CASE BROUGHT BY THE COUNCIL FOR DISCIPLINE. SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO LET ME JUST START THE BEGINNING WITH THE PROCESS DOES SEEM TO SEIZE PROCESS. A WIRE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN A STATE AGENCY DOES THE PROCESS IS AN ALL WAY ALWAYS EXCUSE ME ROBUST FAIR AND COMPLIES AND ALWAYS WITH COMMON LAW FAIR PROCEDURE DOCTRINE. THE MASSAGE THERAPY ACT AND THE BOARD APPROVED PROCEDURES IT MEANS THE CORE TENETS OF DUE PROCESS WHICH ARE NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. ROSS THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ENGAGE IN WHEN THEY DENY OR DISCIPLINE A LOCAL PERMIT- SO INITIALLY A LETTER SENT TO AN INDIVIDUAL A CERTIFICATE HOLDER OR AN APPLICANT. FOR CERTIFICATION THAT LETTER CLEARLY ARTICULATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. THE BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED DENIAL. OR DISCIPLINE AND DISCIPLINE INCLUDES RELOCATION OF A CERTIFICATE. THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE DECISION AND THE PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW SO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS PROCESS. SO THE LETTER- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHERE ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE SO THE LETTERS- WE DO TRAIN RIGHT THEM TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL READING LEVEL VERSES- SOME TYPE OF A HIGHER LEVEL- IN A LETTER CLEARLY IDENTIFIES DATES AND DEADLINES. SO IT NOTIFIES INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY MIGHT MAY REQUEST A HEARING HOW TO REQUEST A HEARING AND ALL OF THOSE SPECIFIC DETAILS- LETTERS ARE SENT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY DAYS BEFORE SPECIFIED HEARING DATE. INDIVIDUALS CAN REQUEST A CONTINUANCE CONTINUANCE IS ARE REGULARLY AND ROUTINELY GRANTED- THERE'S ALSO A DEDICATED EMAIL ADDRESS IN THE LETTERS AND THAT GIVES THE INDIVIDUAL POINT OF CONTACT THAT THEY CAN TALK TO- BY EMAIL IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PROCESS AND HOW TO ACCESS IT- INDIVIDUALS CAN REQUEST. AN ORAL TELEPHONIC HEARING FOR CONSIDERATION OF A WRITTEN STATEMENT- THAT CHOICE IS UP TO THEM IT'S WHATEVER THEY WOULD PREFER. AND THE ACCESS TO PROCESS ALL DONE REMOTELY SO WHEN KOBE CAME ABOUT THERE WAS A NEED TO CHANGE THE PROCESS BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS. COULD ALREADY ACCESS IT- SO THAT THAT REALLY CREATES A NICE EASE OF USE FOR PEOPLE AND IT DECREASES THEIR COSTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL TO A LOCATION. AND MISS WORK FOR THE TIME TO DO THAT TOOK- EVERYONE HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE THE PROPOSED DECISION BEFORE IT TAKES PLACE. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE LETTER THAT THERE'S THAT THEY'RE SENT. PROPOSES THAT SCENE DC IS GOING TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM EITHER DO NINE APPLICATION OR DISCIPLINE OR CERTIFICATE- AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COME HERE AND CHALLENGE THAT BEFORE THAT BECOMES FINAL AND EFFECTIVE. THEY'RE NOT LIMITED IN THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN SUBMIT- THEY- ARE. ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS WE SEE VERY VERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE SEE DECORATIONS WE SEE OUR CHARACTER LETTERS WE SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS- INDIVIDUALS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OR REPRESENTATIVE AND OFTEN AREN'T. AND THEY CAN PROVIDE THE LIVE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES- THROUGH THE ORAL TELEPHONIC HEARING IF THEY CHOOSE THAT OPTION. THEY CAN SUBMIT LEGAL BRIEFS- ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OR ANY FACTUAL ISSUES AND WE SEE THOSE. THOSE ARE NOT LIMITED IN IN LANE THREE SOMETIMES AND REGULARLY GET FIFTY PAGE BRIEFS THAT COME IN. ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I GET TO SUBMIT REPORT USUALLY ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. MATTERS AND CAN I ASK YOU WHO HERE'S THE ISSUE THE ISSUES ARE HEARD BY DEDICATED HEARING OFFICERS. SO THAT'S WHO DECIDES THE MATTERS HE TALKED ON THIS GUY STARTED IT DID JUST GOING KIND OF FAST FOUR THINGS A LITTLE BIT WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOMING HEARING OFFICER. WELL WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AS A AND- WE DON'T SEE. I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MINIMUM WOULD BE BUT WE REQUIRE THAT THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND EITHER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OR IN MASSAGE. SO GENERALLY HEARING OFFICERS ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND- THEY'VE GOT BACKGROUNDS AS MASSAGE TEACHERS- MASSAGE SCHOOL OWNERS. ARE CURRENTLY EVERYONE AND EVERYBODY WHO'S BEEN A HEARING OFFICER THAT IS IN SIZE PROFESSIONAL IS CERTIFIED- AND THEY'RE ALL WELL QUALIFIED FOR THEIR POSITIONS. THEY'RE WELL TRAINED- AND THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE SUBSTANTIVE KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN CONDUCT IS APPROPRIATE WELL MASSAGE IS BEING PROVIDED AND WHEN IT'S NOT- THEY'RE ALSO GUIDED BY STAFF COUNSEL THE STAFF COUNCIL. MUCH LIKE A STAFF COUNCIL MIGHT. PROVIDE OPINIONS AND ANALYSIS TO A CITY CITY COUNCIL STAFF COUNCIL PROVIDES THEM WITH- ADVICE ON LEGAL ISSUES SUCH AS EVIDENTIARY ISSUES. HOW TO WEIGH THE EVIDENCE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY COMPLYING WITH THE PROCEDURES- ADDRESSING LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT MIGHT GET ME IS MADE IN BRIEFS. IT'S ALWAYS ENSURED THAT THE HEARING OFFICERS HAVE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SO THEY HAVE NO PECUNIARY INTEREST IN THE MATTERS BEFORE THEM. THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND WITH THE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEM. ARE THERE NOT TO MENTION MATTERS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL THEY'VE NOT BEEN TARGETS OF ABUSE BY THE INDIVIDUAL WE'RE NOT FRIENDS OR RELATIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AND REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY. THEY ONLY HEAR THE MATTER AT THE END SO THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED AS AN INVESTIGATOR A FACT FINDER FINDER WARRANT INITIAL DECISION MAKER. IN THE PROCESS THAT LEADS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL GETTING A LETTER PROPOSING TO DENY OR DISCIPLINE THEM THINGS SENSUALLY HEARING OFFICERS COME INTO A COLD. I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE HEARING OFFICERS. IT IS NOT A DECISION MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S A DECISION MADE BY A BODY. SO THERE HAS TO BE A MINIMUM LOOK TO HEARING OFFICER THAT HERE EVERY. GENERALLY WE HAVE THREE FOUR AND IT'S A MATURE RULE. SO WE HAVE TO HEARING ON. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY- AND- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHILE IT'S NOT REQUIRED IF THERE'S THREE OR FOUR HEARING OFFICERS ON A ON A MATTER. I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME A DECISION WAS DECIDED THAT WAS NOT UNANIMOUS GREAT AND AGAIN HEARING OFFICERS AS A BODY THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION. IN THAT DECISION CANNOT BE MADE BY THE BOARD- CAN BE MADE BY STAFF OR STAFF ATTORNEYS- SO THEY'RE INDEPENDENT AND THEY THEY MAKE THESE DECISIONS- VERY WELL I HAVE TO SAY I'M ALWAYS INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE HEARING OFFICERS- THERE REALLY DILIGENT- THEY SPEND THEIR TIME REALLY DEBATING ISSUES. AND CONSIDERING HOW TO ACT ON THE INDIVIDUAL ISSUES. THANK YOU THANK YOU AN E. YOU YOU MET YOU MENTIONED A LOT IN IN THAT ANSWER WHICH I APPRECIATE UP AROUND THE PROCESS AT ANY POINT IN THE INFO IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. DOES ANYONE OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL REVIEW ACCUSATIONS- THAT ARE BROUGHT BY THE COUNCIL. NO THE PROCESS ALL RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. SOMETHING COMES IN A COMPLAINT A NOTIFICATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. BACK IT'S REVIEWED BY WHAT WE CALL THE BACKGROUND BACKGROUND REVIEWERS THE BACK AND REVIEW DID DIVISION. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ACTS SORT OF LIKE IN A CRIMINAL PROCESS WOULD BE- LIKE THE INVESTIGATORS THE DA'S OFFICE. THEY INVESTIGATE THEY LOOK AT THE MATTER THEY MAKE A ROPOSED- SOME PROPOSED FINDINGS ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE OCCURRED. THEN THAT GETS SENT OFF AFTER THAT INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED. BACK IT'S NOT TO THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT DROPS THE LETTER PROPOSING TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ECHOED A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS- TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN THIS IS OPEN TO ANYBODY WHO'S WHO'S ON TODAY TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE HOW MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES CURRENTLY REQUIRE CERTIFICATION BY THE COUNCIL. THE PRACTICE MASSAGE. I CAN I CAN ANSWER IT APPROXIMATELY FIVE M. TO ONE FIFTY. BUT THAT NUMBER CHANGES. AND DOES THE COUNCIL WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DRAFT ORDINANCES REQUIRING CERTIFICATION. EVERY DAY- WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST AND ON GOING RELATIONSHIP WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE OUTREACH PROGRAM- WISDOM SO WE MAINTAIN A LIBRARY OF VARIOUS- COUNTY ORDINANCES AND CITY ORDINANCES. WE ARE GIVE THEM FEEDBACK WE PROVIDE THEM WITH- SUGGESTIONS OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES- DIFFERENT- WHEN YOU DEAL WITH A RURAL COUNTY OR YOU DEAL WITH THAT- LARGE CITY THEY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. WE ALSO ARE INVOLVED WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN ALCOHOL ORDINANCE WHICH ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MASSAGE THERAPY ACT AND TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T CREATE ANY KIND OF LOCAL RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH ARE ONEROUS. AND ARE ARE CREATING HARDSHIPS. ON CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST. THANKS ENJOY GOT YET DO YOU BELIEVE THAT FOR THE AVERAGE CITY OR COUNTY INCORPORATING REQUIREMENT THAT ALL MASSAGE THERAPISTS BE CERTIFIED IS A GOOD POLICY. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING- THE CORNERSTONE OF THEIR REVOKE HERBAL REGISTRATION- OUR PROGRAM WHICH I'M GONNA ASK- MR CALLAGY MAYBE YOUR ADDRESS IN A MINUTE THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS POGRAM IS THE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THE CERTIFICATION SO THAT PROGRAM IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN GOING AFTER ILLICIT MASSAGE BUSINESSES AND HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE REALLY AFFECTED. US O MANY MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES DO REQUIRE CERTIFICATION HOWEVER THIS IS REALLY A DECISION THAT IT'S BEST LEFT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DECIDE BECAUSE THE BEAUTY OF THE STATE LAW THAT THE CREATION OF STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY TO A DOCTOR- THIS PROGRAM AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BUT IN SOME LOCAL COMMUNITIES MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM NOT TO REQUIRE IT FOR EXAMPLE. THE MANY THERAPISTS IN OUR INDUSTRY REFERRED TO THEM AS THEIR LEGACY THERAPISTS THERAPISTS WILL BE AROUND FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS HARD WORKING VERY DEDICATED VERY PROFESSIONAL WHO DO NOT MEET THE CORN REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS SO IF A LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS THIS ISSUE THEY CAN ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO WORK AND TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T NEED THIS THE HIGHER REQUIREMENTS. ISN'T THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE LAW SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING. BEST LEFT FOR LOCAL CONTROL. INTERMENT BERMAN I MAY- CEMETERY COUNTY ONE OF THE LEADERS IN IN ONE OF FIRST OF THE I IN THIS. STUDENTS A VOCAL REGISTRATION AT THE PROBLEM WE FOUND WAS IN THE PAST WHEN HE WENT AFTER THE MASSEUSES MANY OF WHO ARE HUMAN TRAFFIC- THE BUSINESS WOULD JUST KEEP OPERATING THEY WOULD SUPPRESSION WITH WITH THE- WITH NEW INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY BRING IN. FOR PURPOSES OF PROSTITUTION WE HOLD THE OWNER ACCOUNTABLE- REVOKE REGISTRATION AND THEREFORE TAKE THE INSTEAD OF OUT OF IT- FOR- DOCTOR OWNER JUST KEEP CONTINUING TO BRING IN. NEW VICTIMS- SO WE GO AFTER THE OWNER AND WE WILL MERELY- CLOSE OUT BUSINESS DOWN. IF THEY ARE. INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THANK YOU BOTH WE IN AND MISTER CARRIE. ARE YOU WHERE IS OUR MOST COUNTIES DO IS THAT WHAT WHAT MOST MUNICIPALITIES DO BECAUSE HE DID DO SOME PEOPLE RAISE ME THE CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW THE ESTABLISHMENTS WERE TO SHUT DOWN AND THEN POP UP. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER- YOU KNOW WITH A NEW NAME AND IT'S THE- MASSAGE THERAPIST WHO WHO IS OFTEN A VICTIM- AS AS YOU ALL SAID- WHO WHO ENDS UP YOU KNOW- IMPACTED BUT NOT NECESSARILY- THE- DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE REAL CRIMINAL- BEHIND ALL OF THIS. IS DENNY THOUGHTS ON THAT. RIGHT RIGHT WE HAVE RECEIVED. MANY MANY INCREASE INTO OUR ORDINANCE AND MANY OTHERS HAVE EMULATED WHAT WE HAVE I DONE HERE BUT THIS IS THE KEY AND HAVING WORKED IN THIS INDUSTRY AND TAKING DOWN MANY OF THESE ILLEGAL MASSAGE PARLORS. IN MY PRIOR CAREER- YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OUT OF THAT- FOR THESE OPERATORS IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CAPITAL INVESTMENT WILL BE IN JEOPARDY IN THE FIRST WEEK IN THE FIRST MONTH. THERE ARE A LOT LESS LIKELY TO OPEN UP THE ILLEGAL CYCLE OR IN THAT. JURISDICTION SO THAT'S WHY MANY HAVE GOLF BALL IT QUITE FRANKLY- YOU KNOW THERE'S SERVER AS FAR AS THE VICTIMS THEY ARE TOO BIG. BY THE WAY THAT THE- HAVING DID INSIDE OUT AND RUN AN UNDERCOVER OPERATION FOR A YEAR INSIDE I GOTTA LOOK INTO THIS THAT. WAS UNBELIEVABLE. BUT MANY OF THEM ARE FORCED INTO THAT IN BELIEVE ME- THEY ARE WAY BETTER OFF OUT OF IT. IN IN MOST OF THEM ARE NOT CERTIFIED. THE YOU- I THINK THAT WRAPS UP OKAY I HAVE ZHOROV. THANK YOU JERRY BERMAN ME JUST STAY ONE YOU KNOW AND LISTENING TO THE- QUESTION AND THE RESPONSES REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS OF DISCIPLINARY IS PROCESS OF. HE'LL OF DENIAL OF PROCESS IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HEARING OFFICERS EMBEDDED IN THE COUNCIL IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LICENSURE OR THE CREATION OF A STATE BOARD TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED- DUE PROCESS ISSUES. SO MY QUESTION IS THIS- TO THE COUNCIL AND THE MEMBERS HERE. HAVE YOU HAVE YOU CONSIDER UTILIZING THE SERVICES OF- AN INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR OR A JUDGE ON THESE CASES WHERE. THESE ARE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES APPROVAL DENIAL DISCIPLINE NOT. USING THE SERVICES OF AN INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR OR A JUDGE FOR EXAMPLE RETIRED JUDGE TO LISTEN AND ULTIMATELY- MAKE FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE DECISION TO THE BOARD ITSELF- FOR THE ULTIMATE DECISION. YES CHAIRMAN ROB I THINK I'LL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT'S OKAY SO TO MY KNOWLEDGE SEEM TO SEE HASN'T LOOKED AT THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT THAT KIND OF A PROCESS IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IF ANYONE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN ARBITRATION IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY AN ARBITRATOR. IN PAST CASES I'VE HAD LITIGATION MATTERS WE'RE PAYING ARBITRATORS YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY TO ARBITRATE THE MATTERS AND GET GOOD ARBITRATORS HERE SEEM TO SEIZE PROCESS IS A VERY INDEPENDENT PROCESS- AND I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES TO WHAT WE SEEM TO SEE OPERATES WITHIN ITS HEARING OFFICERS. THE WAY THAT ALE JAY'S WORK BUT YEAH I THINK SEEM DISEASE PROCESS IS MORE INDEPENDENT THAN THE WAY ALE JAY'S WORK FIRST IN OUR STATE LICENSURE MATTERS LOWER JUST. SAY THAT THE ALE JAY'S TYPICALLY. I COULD BE WRONG WORK FOR THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. AT LEAST IN MANY CASES AND THAT'S SEPARATE FROM WORKING DIRECTLY FOR. THE STATE BORDER BUREAU OR A OR A STATE AGENCY. AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S AN ISSUE I'M JUST. ASKING THE QUESTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PERCEIVED ISSUE OR IT WOULDN'T BE REFLECTED. IN OUR BACKGROUND PAPER AND- I'M NOT SURE FIRST OF ALL IF YOU CHARGE FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS AND CERTAINLY OUR BOARDS AND BUREAUS TOO YOU CAN CERTAINLY ASSESS A FEE FOR THE USE OF A OF AN ARBITRATOR OR A RETIRED JUDGE. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO YOU COULD ALSO TRIAGE THE CASES IN WHICH THE PROCESS SUPPLIES AND RESTRICTED TO ONLY THE MOST SERIOUS WHERE SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO IN ESSENCE EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. WORK IS IN JEOPARDY OR- SCHOOLS ABILITY TO FUNCTION. IS IN JEOPARDY SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION QUESTION BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN A MINUTE RIGHT IT MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGES. THE WORK THAT THEY DO IS PAID FOR BY THE AGENCIES THAT THEY PROVIDE THE WORKFORCE SO IT'S A VERY ANALOGOUS IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT. THE OTHER THING ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS FOR- IF SOMEONE HAS A STATE LICENSE. AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUES A PROPOSED DECISION THEY DO NOT ISSUE A FINAL DECISION. AND THEN THE BOARD ITSELF DECIDES WHAT TO DO WITH THAT PROPOSED DECISION. AND THIS IS A GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ELEVEN FIVE ONE SEVEN. C. ONE. SO THE BOARD CAN DO NOTHING AND JUST ADOPT THE DECISION- IF THAT'S HOW THEY LIKE TO ADDRESS IT. THE US THEY CAN DOCTOR IN THEIR ENTIRETY. THEY CAN REJECT THE DECISION AND REFERRED BACK TO NAIL J. THEY CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THE DECISION. AND THEY CAN REJECT THE DECISION AND DECIDE THE MATTER FOR THEMSELVES. SO I UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES ARE RAISED AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE TO ADDRESS THEM. BUT I THINK THE PROCESS IS APPROPRIATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE FAIR PROCEDURE DOCTOR IN COMMON LAW- THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND THE HEARING OFFICER. OFFICERS ARE VERY WELL THAT IT. AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WANTING TO. PUT IN A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS ON INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND FINANCES TO AFFORD IT- SO THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN YOU KNOW. IN ST. I DON'T USUALLY GIVE THEM A CHOICE. BUT IN IN SITUATIONS I'VE SEEN AND STATE BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE BOARD OF THE COUNTY THERE MIGHT BE AN ACTION AND THEN THEY GET THAT MONEY BACK THAT THEY PAY FOR THAT TO PROCESS THE- A COUNTY BOARD FOR EXAMPLE CAN REQUEST THAT MONEY BACK- AND- IN THOSE INDUSTRIES THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY WHERE INDIVIDUALS. WILL PAY YOU TO BE LICENSED AGAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE FINANCES TO DO IT YOU KNOW MIGHT BE TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INACTION HERE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MAKING A MUCH LOWER AMOUNT OF MONEY PER HOUR. AND DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE AT THE FINANCES TO PAY FOR THAT TYPE OF DUE PROCESS WITH ELEVEN YEARS AGO GOOD THE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT QUESTION SURE IF COST ISN'T AS A FACTOR AND- THE DETERMINATION IS MADE TO KEEP THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS INTERNAL TO THE COUNCIL. WHY WOULD THE COUNCIL BOARD DELEGATE FINAL AUTHORITY TO HEARING OFFICER EMPLOYEES. AND NOT PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR APPEAL TO THE COUNCIL. IF THE INDIVIDUALS OR THE ENTITIES IMPACTED DISAGREE WITH THE HEARING OFFICER'S DECISION. WELL SO. IF YOU'RE ASKING WHETHER THERE IS AN APPEAL I'M I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING WHETHER THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS WELL I'M LOOKING AT THE BACK ROOM OF TALKING ABOUT DENIED SCHOOLS RIGHT HERE. OKAY WELL SCHOOLS ARE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PROCESS SO- I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS SCHOOLS BUT SCHOOLS HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN INDIVIDUALS AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT REASONS BUT ONE OF THE REASONS HAS A COOL COOL STILL USE A HEARING OFFICER CONCEPT TO. PAGE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE OF OUR BACKGROUND PAPER. AND MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT. CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT SUBJECT. BUT MY QUESTION IS- IT RELATES TO THIS STATEMENT A DENIED SCHOOLS SUCH AS THE ONE IN THE RECENT CASE HAS NO OPTION FOR APPEALING A CA. CA MTC DECISION. EXCEPT TO DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE CMT C. ITSELF I EITHER TO HEARING OFFICERS. WHAT SORRY I'M SORRY CENTER OFF THAT IS NOT FACTUALLY CORRECT SO FOR SCHOOL PROCEDURE UP SCHOOLS FIRST OF ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO FULL PROCEDURE THE PROCESS IS VERY FAIR OPEN AND TRANSPARENT THEY'RE PROVIDED WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAIN WITH THE PROPOSED DECISION LONGER TIME FRAMES FOR SCHOOLS SCHOOLS MATTERS ARE HEARD- AGAIN BY A MINIMUM OF TWO HEARING FFICERS BUT GENERALLY THREE AND THEN IF SCHOOLS AREN'T HAPPY WITH THAT DECISION THEY DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL IT TO THE FULL BOARD- AND THEY HAVE I CAN SEE WHERE MEMBER COUNTY SHAKING HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE'S BEEN HE'S HEARD THOSE APPEALS WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO THE FULL BOARD AND THEY KIND OF KILL IT OR NOT. A LABOR IT'S NOT TO BELABOR IT THEN. OUR BACKGROUND PAPER ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE IN THE LITTLE PAGE IS INCORRECT AND LET'S FOCUS ON THE DISCIPLINE CASES TO DISCIPLINE CASES IN THE CASE OF A DISCIPLINE CASES AN INDIVIDUAL BEING DISCIPLINED WHO HAS HIS HER OR THEIR- CASE HEARD BY THE TWO OR THREE HEARING OFFICERS I THINK YOU MENTIONED TWO DOES THAT INDIVIDUAL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCIPLINARY DECISION APPEALED TO THE FULL BOARD. THEY DO NOT SO INDIVIDUAL CERTIFICATION MATTERS- AGAIN REQUIRED TO VAST MAJORITY WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR HEARINGS I'M SORRY HEARING OFFICERS ON THE HEARING SO HE'S A MINIMUM CASE SOMEONE GETS SICK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THE WAY THAT- THE WAY THAT IT'S RUN IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS THREE HEARING OFFICERS. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING AN ACTION SUPERIOR COURT SO THEY WOULD BRING A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CHALLENGING THE DECISION. AND THAT IS THEIR LEVEL OF APPEAL WHICH IS PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HAVING A THIRD JUDGE YOUR ARBITRATOR HEAR THE CASE IN THE BEGINNING. HAS THERE IS ANY CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN BEEN GIVEN TO. ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS. WHO FOR EXAMPLE ARE SUBJECT TO HAVING THEIR OR HAVE. HAD THEIR CERTIFICATION WITHDRAWN THAT'S THE PROPER TERM. BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT DECISION TO THE FULL BOARD GIVEN THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK. AND AGAIN SENATOR ALSO TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT HAS NOT AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT'S A VOLUME ISSUE C. N. T. AND THE TIMING ISSUE SEEM TO SEE AS A VOLUNTEER BOARD THAT MEETS FOUR TIMES A YEAR. IF THIS IF AN APPEAL WAS INSTITUTED WITH IN THE BOARD. THEN I THINK THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE MEETINGS EVERY WEEK POTENTIALLY I MEAN IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON VOLUNTEER BOARDS WITH A LOT OF OPTIONS FULL BOARD. SUB COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD I GUESS I'LL START OFF TO JUST REPEAT THE PREAMBLE TO MY QUESTION YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE LICENSURE. FOR THE CREATION OF A STATE BOARD IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THAT EITHER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED DUE PROCESS ISSUE SO- SUFFICE IT TO SAY ADDRESS MY QUESTION YOU RESPONDED. BY PROVIDERS OF- A SUGGESTION. THAT SOMEONE MIGHT NEED TO AT LEAST PROBABLY SHOULD GIVE A LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE PROCESS. YOUR PERMANENT THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE FROM YOUR BOURBON ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS I DO NOT THINK. OKAY SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON TO OUR PANEL WHO WE'VE ASKED TO WEIGH IN ON VARIOUS MODELS FOR MASSAGE THERAPY REGULATION HOPEFULLY THEY'VE- STUCK WITH ME AND I HAVEN'T PUT THEM TO SLEEP- STARTING WITH BOB BENSON CHAIRMAN ASSOCIATED BODYWORK AND MASSAGE PROFESSIONALS JAMES PARKER.

SAVE INITIAL INSURER CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH OF OFFERING VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION TO SARS SERVICE. KEEPS MOVING AWAY FROM THAT PURPOSE WHICH TO REQUIRE LICENSURE IS BOTH SHEARER AND OVERDUE. MORE THAN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE MASSAGE THERAPY EACH YEAR SERVED BY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND BESIDES THEIR APPROACH NONE OF THOSE SERVICES ARE STATE LICENSE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS. NORWAY'S MASSAGE CONSUMERS BELIEVE MASSAGE THERAPISTS ARE REGULATED BUT THAT ISN'T THE CATCH. OF SCOPE OF PRACTICE DEFINITION BUT ENGAGED AGAINST THEIR POSTS KEEPING THEIR WORK WITHIN BOUNDARIES APPROPRIATE TO THEIR TRAINING.

SHOULD YOU NEED TO SUPPORT YOUR ONGOING CONVERSATION HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND THANK YOU ADAM. WHERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR. EXCUSE ME. LET'S NOW TURN TO THE ASSISTANT DA FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA TERRY ARM ON BEHALF OF SANITARY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN THE ROSE AND MISSION AS THE DA OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH THE PREVENTION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIME HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A VERY COMPLEX CRIME AND THERE CAN BE MANY VARIANCES IN THE FORM THAT IT TAKES AND THE MOTIVATING FACTORS OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IT IS ALSO A CRIME THAT HIDES IN PLAIN SIGHT. ITS INSIDIOUSNESS OFTEN WEARS A MASK OF RESPECTABILITY OR HARMLESSNESS. THE AMERICAN MASSAGE THERAPY ASSOCIATION CLAIMS THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND PROSTITUTION IS THE PROVINCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS IS REALLY A VERY SHORT SIGHTED STATEMENTS WHILE POLICE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING OR WHEN SOMEONE REACHES OUT TO THEM USUALLY BY CALLING NINE ONE ONE. THE REALITY IS THAT THIS CRIME OCCURS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TASK FOR POLICE TO OBSERVE AND INTERVENE. THE VICTIMS OF THIS CRIME ARE OFTEN OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED AND CONTROLLED ENERGY SIMPLY UNACCUSTOMED TO HAVING A WEIGHT. LET ALONE MAKING A NINE ONE ONE CALL. IT IS A CRIME UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER CRIMES WHICH REQUIRES A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH WITH MANY DIFFERENT PARTNERS. C. M. T. C. HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC RESOURCE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE C. A. MTC IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. IT PROVIDES SPECIAL ATTENTION WITH CONSISTENT MEASURES THAT DO NOT EXIST IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAUCRACY. THE COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF CMT C. IS WHAT SEPARATES THEM FROM LICENSING BOARDS. SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS IN YEAR TWO OF THE FIVE YEAR MOU WAS C. A. M. P. C. AND WE ARE READY TO SIGN ON FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. INCLUDED AMONG THEIR MANY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATING ADMINISTERING LOCAL ORDINANCES SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE DA WHEN AUTHORIZED BY STATUTE. PROVIDING HISTORY OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION PROVIDING STATUS OF MASSAGE THERAPISTS CERTIFIED BY C. A. M. P. C. THE SHARE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HIGHLIGHTING RISKS AND EXPLORING SOLUTIONS AND THEY PROVIDE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT A DEDICATED POINT OF CONTACT. HERE IN THE DA'S OFFICE WE WORK WITH OTHER OR I SHOULD SAY WE DEAL WITH OTHER LICENSING BOARDS ARE BOARDS THAT GOVERN ATTORNEYS DOCTORS DENTISTS CONTRACTORS REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS AND THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION BECAUSE EVERYONE IS IN THEIR OWN SILO. WHEN THERE ARE SILOS IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. V. OFFENDERS SLIVER AROUND THE SILOS WHITE SNEAKS. SILOS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND COLLABORATION AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. YOUR SHIFT WAS C. A. M. P. Z. A SIGNIFICANCE AND YEAH AND IT'S ABOUT USING PRACTICAL ANSWERS TO A FESTERING PROBLEM. IF THE C. M. D. C. WERE BROKEN IN. WHY SO SURE MIGHT MIGHT MAKE SENSE BUT IT'S NOT BROKEN IT IS WORKING IT'S WORKING WELL WE LIKED IT. R. D. ROSEN PREVIOUSLY STATED IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT AND THIS IS STILL TRUE THERE IS A REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT. VICTIM SERVICES GROUPS OUR WOMEN'S GROUPS SUPPORT C. A. M. CHEESY WERE UNITED AND THE SUPPORT BECAUSE IT WORKS. WE ASKED FOR AN EXTENSION THAT ALLOWS THE MO USE BETWEEN C. A M. T. Z. AND OTHER ENTITIES TO BE EXECUTED. YOU'VE GIVEN FIVE YEARS IN THE PAST IT'S BEEN A GOOD FIVE YEARS IT'S A GOOD TIME TO GIVE FIVE YEARS AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM NOW MICHAEL CONNECTS CALIFORNIA. PROFESSIONALS SUCH THERAPY COALITION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN- MEMBERS MY CONNECTION HERE ON THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE THERAPY COALITION WHICH REPRESENTS MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND LICENSEES FRANCHISEES OF THE NATIONAL CHAINS AND THE LARGEST SCHOOL FOR THERAPIST I'M HERE ON ON BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP MOST OF OUR INDUSTRY. I WANT TO GIVE THIS LITTLE CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH C. M. D. C. OR EMBARK ON ON A VERY AMBITIOUS- TENUOUS LICENSING PROPOSAL- MASSAGE BUSINESS LIKE MANY DURING THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN THROUGH A GREAT DEAL IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. MANY OF MY MEMBERS AND THOSE ARE NOT MY MEMBERS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN FOR SEVEN TO ELEVEN MONTHS- DRAMATICALLY REDUCED INCOMING CUSTOMER TRAFFIC AFTER REOPENING THERAPISTS- EXITING THE INDUSTRY IN DROVES AND OF COURSE THERAPISTS ARE THE THING THAT MAKES OUR BUSINESSES WORK- IT WAS AWFUL- IT WAS TERRIBLE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CATCH YOUR BREATH AND STABILIZE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN. A VERY CHALLENGING TIMES WITH EXTREME. INFLATION AND THAT SORT OF THING SO I OFTEN GET ASKED OFTEN IN DIFFERENT ROLES YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT CAN THIS LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS CENTER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE- YOU CAN YOU CAN HELP SMALL BUSINESS BY NOT PLACING ANY ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON US AND WE NEED. REGULATORY CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY I WE DON'T NEED ANY NEW EXPENSES AND WE DON'T NEED REGULATORY COMPLEX- SO THAT'S POINT ONE ALSO I WANNA MAKE THIS A QUICK OBSERVATION ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION AND SEEING TO SEE- YOU'LL SEE HIM TO SEE IS A SUCCESS- IT REFLECTS KIND OF THE GENIUS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS. AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT AND THEY GET IT IN A WAY THAT. YEAH I THINK WE HAVE TO MINUTES NOT. BUT ITS WORK AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS- BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN THIS BREATH. OF GROUP COMING TO THE SUPPORT OF ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A REGULATED THERE IS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT MEANS DEEP- IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY PRETTY PASSION AS WELL- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT'S GOT TO GIVE ONE PAUSE ABOUT. A TINKERING WITH WITH THAT MODEL- AND ONE MUST THINK ABOUT KIND OF THE VALUE THAT IT THAT IT BRINGS. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF LICENSING ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THIS CONVERSATION IN MY MIND IS THAT THE LICENSING IS KIND OF BEING TALKED ABOUT- UP HERE IS SOME KIND OF UNREALIZED GOLD AND- YOU KNOW THOUGHT. PROCESS THAT DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD- I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THAT THIS WILL CREATE HIGHER COSTS- THAT INCREASE THE COST OF THE TEST- BOTH THE ACTUAL OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY. THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED C. L. E. WHICH IS ALSO GOING TO CREATE COSTS FOR THE THERAPIST- MEAL THERE WAS REFERENCE TO THE STUDY I MEAN A- VERY QUALIFIED. ENTITY THAT REGULARLY DOES STUDIES ON THE COSTS RELATIVE TO DCA BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS- AS IS DONE VERY THOROUGH STUDY ON KIND OF WHAT IT WILL COST AND IT'S A FIVE FOLD INCREASE. IT'S A THOUSAND DOLLARS WHATEVER. I'M IT'S NOT GONNA BE IN LIKE. WHAT MAYBE MAYBE IN MISSISSIPPI- I OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE REGULATORS HAVE A STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. AND IN A VERY DIFFICULT TASK AND SO WE SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE SHOULDN'T- TRY TO PRETEND THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE- ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT IT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR WHY WE NEED LICENSING IS SO THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO ITS JOB IRONICALLY TO MEET IS UNANIMOUSLY AND WILL SEPARATELY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE THING THEN AND NOW. WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED TO SEE HIM TO SEE IS A VERY GOOD PARTNER. AND C. M. D. C. ONE OF THE KNOCKS ON US YET TO SEE IS THAT IT FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON. TRAFFICKING I FIND THAT KIND OF AN ASTONISHING ASSERTION- THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES OF THE DAY WHICH REALLY NEEDS TO BE. YOU KNOW GOT MASTER. AND PARTICULARLY. IN THE SENATE DISTRICT- EIGHT YOU KNOW OBJECTIONS TO SEE AND DO YOU SEE IS THAT WELL THE DEFICIT THE DEFECT IN THE C. M. D. C. MODEL IS THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. OF THE C. M. D. C. THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME FOLKS OUT THERE OPERATING THAT AREN'T SUBJECT TO THE CFTC CERTIFICATION- THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IF THERE'S A LICENSING REGIME. EVERYBODY WILL GET LICENSE EVERYONE WILL COMPLY AND THAT'S JUST. NOT THE EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT TRUE- EVERYBODY SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAR INSURANCE AND THERE'S A DRAMATIC NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO DON'T HAVE SO IT'S NOT REALLY ACTUALLY GONNA SOLVE THAT PROBLEM NECESSARILY- SO A COUPLE THINGS SPECIFICALLY THE FINANCING- THE KIND OF THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE APPROACH THAT I SAW WAS SUGGESTED. ONE OF THE WAYS THEY'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT IS SWEET CMT C. SPOTS. DOES NOT. IT'S NOT LEGAL IT WOULD BE A TAKE. ON THE REPORT WHICH IS LONG I JUST SIXTY PAGES. DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF REAL DATA DATA ABOUT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH C. M. D. C. AS IT RELATES TO CONSUMERS. AND LICENSEE. I'M NOT EVEN ACTUALLY A LOT OF GREAT ANECDOTES ABOUT THE GREAT ARM. THAT'S HAPPENING THE CALIFORNIAN I DON'T HAPPEN TO BELIEVE. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CONSUMERS THINK. IS A GOOD RATIONALE FOR TRYING TO GET IN THERE AND DO THE KIND OF THIS DRAMATIC OVERHAUL OF THE LICENSING OF. A GIGANTIC INDUSTRY NOW. IF CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED IN THAT CAN BE SHOWN THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THE OTHER THING IS- IT IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE- DID THEY REPORT ASSUMES THAT GOING TO A LICENSING WILL ESSENTIALLY CREATE STATEWIDE PREEMPTION OF WHAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE DOING- AND SOMEHOW THAT WILL SAVE MONEY FOR THE ENTITIES THAT INTERACT IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING THAT HASN'T BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PREEMPT. LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER SOME OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING DURING THE PANDEMIC WE LEARN THAT YOU KNOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND PARTICULAR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE AN EXTRARDINARY AMOUNT OF CONTROL AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S RIGHT- SO. FOR US WHO ARE DEEPLY STEEPED IN THE INDUSTRY AND WHAT WORKS WE SUPPORT C. M. D. C. FROM A COUPLE OTHER THINGS IS BRINGING BACK THE EXAM SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT'S- LIFE- THERAPIST PROFESSION IS VERY ACCESSIBLE IT'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE IT'S NINETY PLUS PERCENT WOMEN AND AN EXAM IF NOT DONE PROPERLY AND THEY HAVE A SPECIFIC EXAMINE MY- UP EITHER OWNED. BY THEIR OWN DOCUMENT SAYS THEY'LL BE 30% PEOPLE THAT'LL BE WASHED OUT OF THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PASS THAT EXAM. THIS BODY HAS BEEN VERY CONCERNED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WHAT AN EXAM DOES FOR DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY. THE OTHER THINGS THAT I NOTICE IS- THE TIME FRAMES ARE ASTONISHING NINETY- DENTISTS TO PACE THE IMPOSITION OF A SCOPE OF PRACTICE WITHOUT DELAY OR DRUNK. ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED THERE'S NO PRACTICE CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT'S GOING TO BE A MULTI YEAR SLOG AT BEST- THOSE. THIS ONE DEFINITELY GOT MY ATTENTION THAT THERE WILL BE MONITORING SAVINGS FROM IMPLEMENTING A NEW IT SYSTEM FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY- I'LL LET THAT SINK IN FOR JUST A SECOND I ASSUME THE CFTC WILL HAND OVER ITS DATABASE. OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF PRIVACY ISSUES ELATED TO THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY'LL DO GRANDFATHERING IS ALLOW OR WILL REQUIRE- SOME OF THE LEGACY FOLKS. TO HAND OVER THEIR TAX RETURNS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVE HIMSELF I THINK THIS THIS. THIS IDEA. SURFACED A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE A WINNER HEARING WAS ORIGINALLY- ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED IT HASN'T GOTTEN REALLY ANY KIND OF THOROUGH REVIEW AND I WAS REALLY DELIGHTED TO HEAR THE CHAIRS ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE END YOU SEE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT'S% THE PROPER APPROACH AND LET'S LET'S DIVE IN LET'S ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. LET'S SEE WHERE THERE ARE SOME. CHALLENGES OR ISSUES ALWAYS SEEM TO SEE WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THERAPISTS FOR THOSE CONSUMERS UP TO THE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING MAYBE GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE TOOLS- THAT KIND OF THING- LICENSING AS ENVISIONED IN THIS REPORT DOESN'T EXIST. IN CALIFORNIA IT WILL BE VERY COMPLICATED IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE- AND IT WILL BE LAID ON AN INDUSTRY THAT IS STRUGGLING- MILE SO I THINK FOR US THE ENERGY SPENT TALKING ABOUT LICENSING WOULD BE BETTER SPENT LOOKING AT. IT BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EXISTING INSTANCE YOU THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL VERY ESTABLISHED TO USE KIND OF A METAPHOR. THAT BEEN GOING ON IN MY HOUSE AT THE- IF THE KITCHEN NEEDS REMODEL THAT'S YEAH. THAT'S FINE LET'S NOT THIS MAN IT AND PRETEND THAT WE CAN BUILD SOMETHING BETTER FROM SCRATCH OVER HERE IN ANOTHER LOCATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO- RESPOND ANY OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU BYE AND BEFORE WE MOVE TO QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS THAT AT THE RISK OF OPENING UP. THE WHOLE PURPOSE FOR HAVING PANELS WHICH IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FOR THIS COMMITTEE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FULL AND- FAIR AND OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO THAT. WELL WE HAVE NO PRECONCEIVED NOTION AS TO HOW THIS. ENDS UP. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE RECORD SO THAT WE CAN MAKE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO HAVING SAID THAT I'M GOING TO START AT THE TOP. AND GIVE EACH ONE OF THE PANELISTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PANEL. TWO MINUTES- TO OFFER ANY POINT COUNTERPOINT TO WHAT'S BEEN SAID BY ANY OF THEM STARTING WITH MISTER BOB BENSON SERVED TAKEN AWAY. YOU'RE ON YOU'RE ON MUTE I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT THIS AGAINST YOUR TIME NOW YOU'RE ON. OKAY THANK YOU- YEAH OPPONENTS OF LICENSURE HAVE NOT ANSWERED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF WELL FIRST OF ALL. HOW DOES A PEACE OFFICER WALKING INTO AN ESTABLISHMENT- WHERE- IFSOMEONE DOES THAT'S NOT CHOSEN TO OBTAIN CA AND PIECES OF RETENTION- HAVE- AN ABILITY TO REALLY KNOW HOW TO RECOVER REACT TO WHAT'S GOING ON TO MAKE A JUDGMENT SPARE- IF YOU HAVE MANDATORY LICENSURE WELL UNDER PERCENT OF PEOPLE UNDER THE TENT. SO TO SPEAK- IT'S A CLEAR CUT- SITUATION- OFFICER CAN SAVE PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR LICENSE- CHECK AGAINST DATABASE- MAINTAINED BY THE STATE BOARD AND WOULD KNOW DEFINITIVELY WHETHER SOMEBODY IS OPERATING WE. TO OR NOT THAT'S ONE ASPECT. THE STATEMENT WAS MADE BY MR FORM- CHAIR- SUGGESTING THAT SO THE COST OF THE LEDGER WOULD BE FIVE TIMES. WHAT IT IS FOR ANY SEM PIECES FOR PROPRIO OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S NOT SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT THE MEDIAN- LICENSEES GAVE BIRTH TO YOUR LICENSE AND THE FORTY FIVE STATES DO HAVE LICENSING IF ONE HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS A YEAR- THE- WE HAVE FIVE. THE FIRST RESPONSE- TO GERMAN ROSS- COMMENTS SAID IN OUR CONVERSATION I WAS. SHARED WITH THEM LAST NOVEMBER I SPENT SOME TIME PUTTING TOGETHER MODEL WORKING COSTS FOR A YEAR A LICENSING REGIME AND- CALIFORNIA. AND WE ENDED UP CONCLUDING THAT- IT WOULD WORK- WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL FEE OF A HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS TRANSITIONING THEM AFTER THAT INITIAL PERIOD UP TO A HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS- THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME ASPECTS OF THE MAKE. THINGS MORE EXPENSIVE- IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALL BOARDS ONE THOSE ARE FACTORED INTO BATTLE. THAT INFORMATION AND THE REQUIRED BY PEOPLE THAT SO THE ANSWER THE CENTER ALSO WAS LARGELY INCORPORATED- IN THE- ANSWER TO ONE OF THE SUNRISE QUESTIONS ON THE DOCUMENTS JUST RECENTLY WELCOME ABOUT. I SUGGEST THAT WE BEGAN. ALSO SERVED- AND THAT YOU THE PEOPLE USED THAT. SOME CRISPY THAT WE PUT TOGETHER ALONG WITH TAKING A THOUGHTFUL WORK AT FOURTEEN PAGE SHOW PROPOSED BILL- THAT- WAS ALSO WERE INTRODUCED IN RECENT DAYS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OPPORTUNITY TO REBUT. THANK YOU SIR- MISTER SPEAKER ANY FINAL COMMENTS. I'M NOT TOO MUCH I JUST JUST WANT TO POINT OUT- YOU KNOW WHILE YOU WELL I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE POSITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WICHITA KANSAS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY OPPOSITION FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICES FROM EIGHT POLICE ASSOCIATION- AND- HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LICENSURE- IN FACT YOU KNOW MOST RECENTLY THE CITY OF ROCHESTER MINNESOTA. I WENT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND UPON THEM HOW IMPORTANT IT WOULD BE FOR THEM AND THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES- YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE DATA OUT LIKE I SAID I. DON'T WANT TO BE BETTER FOR ANYBODY ARE. ON THIS CALL- I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT. YOU KNOW MISTER JOHNSON DIED- PHYSICIAN ON EXAM THIRTY PERCENT- IF I. I'M READING MY DATA CORRECTLY 53% OF PEOPLE PASSED THE BAR EXAMINATION SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE WE'RE TALKING THIRTY PERCENT. AND THERE THAT DO NOT PASS- I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBERS OFF HAND ON THAT THE SECOND GO AROUND WITH THAT WOULD GO UP TO BUY. YEAH WE HAVE TO AT SOME POINT RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE- YOU KNOW STICKING OUT SERVICES FOR HEALTH RELATED REASONS AND WE SHOULD PUT SOME REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF COMPETENCY- AND MEASURED AT COMPETENCY- AND BEFORE WE SEND THEM OUT INTO THE WORK FORCE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR- MS HARMAN ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO MR BENTSEN'S COMMENT ABOUT AS I UNDERSTOOD IT C. M. T. C. R. REALLY NOT HELPING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NOT. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER WE SEE A MTC INVOLVED SO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS C. A. M. P. C. IS CONDUCTED. COUNTYWIDE TRAININGS FOR LOCAL POLICE ON IDENTIFYING ILLICIT MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS. OUR TEAM AND SEE A MTC HAVE INITIATE A SHADED PILOT PROGRAMS OF CRIMINAL AND REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT. WITHIN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN CITIES LIKE CAMPBELL CALIFORNIA. SHE COUNSELED FOR CMT C. ASSISTED CAMPBELL CITY COUNCIL IN RETRACTING LOCAL ORDINANCES FOR MASSAGE BUSINESSES PROVIDING INSPECTORS AND POLICE GOOD TOOLS FOR BETTER OVERSIGHT THIS WORK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TOO THAT I THINK MR BENTSEN IS MISSING WHEN WE SAY THIS IS WHY C. A. M. P. C. WORKS. WHEN THE POLICE IDENTIFY EIGHTY ILLICIT MASSAGE PARLOR WE NEED TO MOVE FAST YOU HAVE TO BE NIMBLE. AND BECAUSE THESE PLACES IT CAN BE A SORT OF A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE YOU TAKE OUT ONE AND THERE'S A POP UP IN ANOTHER CITY AND SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL. AND THE FISSION PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT C. A. M. P. T. C. OFFERS IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND COLLABORATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. MR CONNECTION YOU GET THE LAST WORD. THAT'S THAT'S A THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THAT- I GUESS THAT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS SO A COUPLE OF THINGS I I'LL LET LAW ENFORCEMENT KIND OF. RESPONDED THAT OBVIOUSLY WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THIS HEARING BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICER THE STOCK IN DOING THEIR JOB JOB- BY LACK OF A PIECE OF PAPER IT'S JUST NOT REALLY HOW IT WORKS- THEY ALSO CAN ACTUALLY GO ON THE WEBSITE AND IF THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION REQUIRES THAT THEY CAN GO ON THE WEBSITE AND SEE IF YOU SEE AND LOOK UP WHETHER SOMEONE HAS THAT- SO AND DIFFERENT WAY. IN OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA IS A VERY UNIQUE ANIMAL I HAVE LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE. IN THE BE KIND OF THE STEALTH SUNRISE DOCUMENT- BUT THE ANALYSIS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS INCLUDING A RESPONSE TO THE SUNRISE DOCUMENTS. DONE BY CAPITAL COUNTY PARTNERS IS THERE- IT'S ROBUST IT'S THOROUGH AND IT'S DONE BY SOMEONE THAT IS DEEPLY STEEPED IN HOW IT WORKS IN CALIFORNIA. AS TO THE TEST I DON'T WANT TO. PREDETERMINE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I JUST KNOW AMONG MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. THERE IS A DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT IT'S TESTING OUT. ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND I APPRECIATE BRINGING UP THE BAR EXAM BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. OUR STATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. ABOUT THE PASSAGE RATE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME A TOOL OF EXCLUSION AS OPPOSED TO- SOME OTHER INDICIA OF SOME KIND OF A COMPETENCE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS GO ON. ALL THE TIME SO JUST BEFORE WE ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO DO A TEST. WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM A CALIFORNIA LANDS AND HOW IT WORKS ON OUR VERY DIVERSE POPULATION. AND ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ACTUALLY A PRE JUDGED OPINION ON THAT. I JUST KNOW THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS LOOKED AT IT VERY CAREFULLY AND IF WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THIS PATH. THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF A VERY THOROUGH AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS. AND ONE FINAL THING I GUESS IS- I THOUGHT I HEARD MR BENSON SAY THAT A BILL HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. I'M I'M ESTIMATES. THAT I APOLOGIZE THAT IS THERE A BILL NUMBER. I'M SURE YOU ALL CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT OFFLINE OKAY. NOPE NO WORK THANK YOU I SEE THAT A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL HAS HIS HAND UP ON THE SCREEN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THAT- COMMENT- IN IN WRITING DIRECTED TO- OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE AND WILL MAKE THAT A MATTER OF A RECORD SIR. SO THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS ON THIS MASSAGE THERAPY REGULATION MODEL MODELING PANEL- LET'S NOW TURN TO- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. FOR BOURBON ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU THE PLEASE THERE IT IS THANK YOU SURE OFTEN AND I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE ABILITY FOR FOLKS TO IT TO ANSWER AND HAVE A LITTLE BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I AGREE YEAH THAT WAS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF TODAY'S- LEASE THIS PANEL ON TODAY'S HEARING ANYTHING THAT'S HELPFUL- FOR ALL OF US AS WE DELIBERATE THAT THE DIFFERENT MODELS HERE- AND I WAS ALSO WANT TO SAY I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR MR COMMUTES AND SAY THAT- HE AGREES THAT YOU KNOW WE DID IF THE IF THEIR CAR TO BE HAD ABOUT REMODEL. THAT THAT HE'S OPEN TO THAT I DIDN'T GET THAT SENSE. SOME OF THE ANSWERS. TO SOME QUESTIONS IN THE EARLIER PANEL- AND SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR AND- THAT EVERYBODY IS OPEN. TO IT TO DIFFERENT- IMPROVEMENTS EITHER TO THE EXISTING MODEL. ARE THE ME TO SAY THAT I'M I'M GLAD THAT AT LEAST EVERYBODY. IS OPEN TO IMPROVEMENTS TO THE EXISTING MODEL- AND I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO. TO HEAR THAT. A QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY I SUPPOSE IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY. A BIGGER PROBLEM. IN STATES THAT HAVE A LICENSOR. I CAN I CAN ANSWER THIS. PLEASE WELL I EXCUSE ME OUT OF HERE THE FURNITURE OFF I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO- I DON'T I DON'T LISTEN I DON'T MIND I'M NOT GOING TO STICK STRICTLY TO THE PANELS BUT LET'S START WITH PANEL B. WHICH IS THE MASSAGE THERAPY MODELING PANEL AND THEN. WE CAN MOVE TO THE COUNCIL TO ANSWER THIS. ANY TAKERS IN PANEL B. MR BENSON. THIS RECORD. I'M QUESTION IF I'M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY SIR AS IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING- PROBLEM IN OTHER STATES WHERE WHERE THEY ARE NICE IS IT A BIGGER PROBLEM IT YOU KNOW YOU GET GIVEN- THE IF WE ALL AGREE THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IS IT A BIGGER PROBLEM IN STATES WITH LICENSURE THEN IN IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS A- DIFFERENT MODEL. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN SAY THAT AND IT IT REALLY- YOU KNOW EVERY AFTERNOON BUT IF ANYBODY'S BEEN FOLLOWING AND YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH. LAWYERS AND YOU KNOW THEY'VE TURNED DOWN A ROLE AND- YOU KNOW OTHER FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW. PUTTING IT IN. PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA FLORIDA PROBABLY THE WORST WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING YOU HAVE. LICENSE PERSON BY LICENSE- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK- YOU KNOW. WELL I THINK WE CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT EVEN IN STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED- RIGOROUS RESTRICTIONS ON THE CLUSTER ACTIVE BACK. IN AN ATTEMPT TO- ADDRESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING THIS YEAR HAS NOT WORKED- INTO THE POINT OUT OF THE EMPTY SEAT AND YOU KNOW I. WANT TO GO ON RECORD AND THEN THE MDC DOES A LOT OF THINGS WELL- AND I BELIEVE THAT- BUT YOU KNOW WE DO- JIM IT'S HARD TO FIND I BELIEVE- WORK. WITH MUNICIPALITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY- IN CREATING ORDINANCES THAT HELP THEM ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW JUST IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE A BMP. I'VE WRITTEN TO ORGAN ANSWERS- WE'VE WRITTEN AN OREGON STATE. COLORADO THAT NOW IS. RIGHT AN ORDINANCE IN COLORADO THAT IS NOW YOU KNOW THE SUBJECT OF STATE LAW- BECAUSE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH. THE CRIMINALITY LINES AS OPPOSED TO. YOU KNOW PUTTING IT OVERLY UNNECESSARY BARGAINING ON THE MOST FASTER- SEVEN YOUR QUESTION I YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON ON NUMBERS BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT- THERE IS A WAY TO ANSWER THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH COMPLEX MASSAGE OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING YEAH- IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN YEAH. AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT REALLY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE. BUT ON EARLIER IT'S YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS A- FINANCIAL. THERE'S LONGER AND YOU KNOW IT GETS YOU KNOW IT CAN GET YOU STARTED HERE- THANK YOU HEATHER THANK YOU. YEAH I'M LOOKING AT A GALLERY FULL OF PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE TO SIT HERE WHEN I SIT HERE SO. MR EXECUTIVE OFFICER YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT IN ONE MINUTE. YES I CAN DO ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT- YOU KNOW I AGREE MUSIC MISTER SPEAKER TO DO REASON. AN ACTUAL- QUANTIFIED STATISTICS. ARE ABOUT THAT BUT- YOU CAN SEE IN THE NEWS THEY WERE VERY WELL KNOWN CASES- IN FLORIDA A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THE OWNER OF A VERY WELL KNOWN FOOTBALL TEAM. WAS CLOCKED IN AT AN ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS- INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT WAS VERY SAD SITUATION IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA- YEAR AND A HALF AGO WITH A SHOOTER IN A- ESTABLISHMENTS WERE INVOLVED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING SO WE DID IT'S A VERY SERIOUS- NATIONAL PROBLEM. I WOULD OFFER THAT THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER ON SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. BED IS WORKING WITH STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY OTHER COUNTRIES ABROAD. AND THERE WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS C. M. D. C. MODEL. AND FIND IT TO BE SO POWERFUL. THEY DEFECTED IN DEALING WITH ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE FUTURE OF THEIR LAST YEAR IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE. OUR WORD THE- PRESENTED NOT ONLY TO OTHER STATES WHAT DO OTHER COUNTRIES TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA MODEL IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY WANT TO BE IN YOUR LIFE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU I GUESS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS INFORMATION PERFECT. PERVERT BERMAN- WITH A QUESTION PROBABLY FOR BENSON INSPECTOR WE ARE ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF LICENSURE IS THAT ENFORCEMENT WOULD TAKE MUCH LONGER WHICH WE CERTAINLY SEEN AS A PROBLEM WITH SOME BOARDS. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT CONCERN. ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN IN THIS INDUSTRY. IT STARTED OUT WITH THE WITH THAT ONE- THE- MANY OF MANY OF THE FEATURES- OF- THERE HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT- BY CMT C. ADVOCATES- HERE TODAY ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN THE- OF THE GRAPH BUILT OF THAT SO WE HAD INTRODUCED- SOMETIME BACK HELP AT THIS POINT- BUT UNTIL WE PUT IT OUT THERE FOR PUBLIC VIEW- THE SUMMARY SUSPENSION IS THERE- THE- OR RADIO. CONTROL- PENALTIES. IS EXPANSIVE- IN THE PROPOSED BILL- THE WITH THE BIRD SHE HAS BUT- WITH REQUIRED LICENSURE- ALMOST ALWAYS THERE BUT SHOULD BE COVERED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD BE INVOLVED- IN TERMS OF A JURY GETTING CASES AND- THAT SERVE WITH GREEK TOO WE BELIEVE STUFF A STRONGER- SITUATION AND IN TERMS OF STAYING ON TOP OF. THESE CHALLENGES OUT OF CERTAIN HOW TO SHARPEN THE PENCIL HERE BUT- THE QUESTION IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS. WHO FORGOT TO PARAPHRASE MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A JURY ASK IT BUT- WITH A LICENSED ORGANIZATION DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THE SAME TIME STANDARDS THAT. THE COUNCIL HAS WITH RESPECT TO DISCIPLINARY PROCESS HAPPEN. IN STATE BOARDS AND BUREAUS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY OUR CALIFORNIA LAW. SURE BERMAN THAT I'VE- MESSED UP HE SAYS IT'S OKAY THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU. AND. BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I JUMP AND QUITE AND THIS IS AN ISSUE AND IT IS AND WE'VE YOU KNOW BEEN DEALING WITH THOSE YOUNG FOR MY SEVEN YEARS- HERE- AND LONGER- AND THAT YOU KNOW ACTIVE LICENSING TOWARD PEOPLE WITH ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THEM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH I'M STATE THOSE. IN FLORIDA AND GEORGIA AND ALABAMA- IS- A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THAT LICENSE WHILE DUE PROCESS- PLAYS OUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES AND WHY THAT AND YOU KNOW SO WIDELY REPORTED IN THE MEDIA AS YOU KNOW IF THERE'S AN ACCUSATION AND IT MAKES IT TO THE CHRIST THE PRESS INQUIRES WITH THE BOARD AND THAT PERSON STILL HAS AN ACTIVE LIFE BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS EXPLAINED OUT MATS YOU KNOW THE CARDS THAT WE WERE TOLD ME THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW SPECIFIC STATES DECIDE- SO WHAT WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR IS WHEN THERE'S AN ACCUSATION IF THERE IS. ANY SORT OF LITIGATION AT THE AUTOMATIC- TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THAT LICENSE WHILE DUE PROCESS PLAYS OUT I CAN'T SAY THAT IN FACT YOU CAN GUARANTEE ANY TIME FRAME- YOU KNOW LIKE THE C. MCC I BELIEVE IS AT A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE DAYS ARE SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT FIVE YOU KNOW IT'S UP TO THE STATES IN THE STATE COURT SYSTEMS FIVE YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH WITH THE STATE AND YEAH SIX- HELPING YOU FIX THAT PROBLEM DRESS THE ISSUE WELL MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US EXCEPT WITH REGARD OF SEVERAL OF OUR BOARDS AND GIRLS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT MAY DIFFER FROM BORDER TO BORDER BUREAU TO BUREAU BUT- IT MINISTRATION BILLY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THEN YOU HAVE A VERY SHORT TIME LINE IN WHICH TO. TAKE THE ACCUSATION AND BEGIN THE PROCESS AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE YOUR INVESTIGATION COMPLETE AT THAT POINT AND IF A CRIMINAL PROCESS IS INVOLVED YOU ARE HERE MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN AGAIN PERHAPS DEPENDED ON THE BOARD YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE JUDGE IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. AND HAVE THE JUDGE APPROVED A TEMPORARY LICENSE. SO I YOU WILL WHO FUNCTION IN OTHER PARTS OF THE- WITH LACE. ARE CLIMBING IN THE NEWS. HERE IN CAL. WHETHER IT'S GOOD ONE OR A BAD ONE. BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE HAVE HERE BERMAN. BUT THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR NOW FEATURE OFF. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I- YOU KNOW MY CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH THE REASON FOR PURSUING LICENSURE IN THE COST OF THE LICENSE AND THAT'S SIMPLY IT FOR ME AND WE WERE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THOSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE LICENSE. FOR PUBLIC OR CONSUMER SAFETY REASONS WE DON'T LICENSE TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OR TO AFFORD A STATUS TO ANY PARTICULAR ROCK OCCUPATION FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON IT'S SIMPLY THAT AND WE KNOW THAT LICENSURE CAN BE A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT LICENSURECAN BE A BARRIER TO WORK. AND THEY CAN CERTAINLY COST MONEY AND IT CERTAINLY COSTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT AND DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF MY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING SURE BERMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS A COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY AND THIS GOES WAY BEFORE MY COLLEAGUE SIMON PROBABLY WAY BEFORE OUR PREDECESSORS TIME WE HEAR WE DECIDE TO LICENSE AN OCCUPATION PRESUMABLY FOR THE APPROPRIATE REASONS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND CONSUMER SAFETY. WE CREATE A BOARD A VERY EXPENSIVE BOARD BECAUSE OF OUR WAGE AND BENEFIT SCHEDULES HERE WITH STATE WORKERS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER. AND THEN WE HAND THE NEW LICENSEE OF BILL. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SINCE WE'RE DEALING WITH A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT CORPORATION ORGANIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. AND PROVIDED A TAX EXEMPTION PRESUMABLY BY THE FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THE STATE LEGISLATURE. CAN SWEEP THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF A PRIVATE FIVE OH ONE C. THREES. A BANK ACCOUNT AND SWEEP IT INTO THE STATE TREASURY. AND WHETHER THAT CONSTITUTES A TAKING- WHEN THE FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE HAS AN IRIS FEDERAL IRIS RESPONSIBILITY AS- WELL AS A RESPONSIBILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA UPON DISSOLUTION. TO DIRECT THAT MONEY FOR TAX EXEMPT. PURPOSES SO AT SOME POINT THOSE WHO HAVE A PROPER DIFFIE STUDY THAT SUGGESTS THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER YOU'VE OBTAINED A LEGAL OPINION. AS TO WHETHER THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY WORKS AND HOW WE GO ABOUT IT AND WHETHER WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WHEN WE DO THAT. BUT FINALLY IT OCCURS TO ME THAT WHETHER WHICHEVER FEE STUDY WE TAKE HER WHETHER WE DIVIDE THEM IN THE MAIL OR GET ANOTHER ONE. WHETHER THE FEE STUDY SHOWS AN INCREASE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR OR AN INCREASE TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR- AT THE OUTSET. IT IS CLEAR TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS FOR ANY NUMBER OF YEARS WITH. THIRTY SOMETHING BOARDS AND BUREAUS THAT THE COST OF LICENSURE WILL WILL BE FAIRLY HIGH. AND THAT THE COST OF LICENSURE ALMOST ASSUREDLY WILL GO UP YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR AND THE BOARD IF THERE IS ONE WILL BE BACK HERE THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE BACK HERE ASKING US TO APPROVE A FEE INCREASE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO ARE LICENSED. IN THIS CASE BY A POTENTIAL. MASSAGE THERAPY LICENSE BOARDS SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THOSE ISSUES HI NOT SURE BERMAN JOINS ME IN THIS. THESE ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES WE WILL DEVOTE THE TIME AND ATTENTION NECESSARY. TO GET THIS RIGHT BUT- LAYS IN GERMAN THOSE OF YOU WHO PARTICIPATED ON OUR PANELS- AND THOSE FROM THE COUNCIL WHO WERE HERE- I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS IN THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE. FOR I TURN IT OVER TO PUBLIC COMMENT SURE BERMAN ANY FINAL COMMENTS NO JUST APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S PARTICIPATION THANKS. OKAY LET'S KNOW HOW EXCEPT TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL WE HAVE I'M SURE VARIETY OF WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY- SO LET'S START WITH THE FIRST HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WAITING TO TESTIFY AND THAT DOESN'T COUNT THE NUMBER WHO ARE ON OUR PHONE LINES. SO WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR YOU TO. IDENTIFY YOURSELF. STATE YOUR NAME WHO YOU'RE REPRESENT IF YOU REPRESENT ANYONE. AND THEN A VERY VERY BRIEF STATEMENT OF YOUR POSITION. I WOULD LIKE TO LIMIT THE STATEMENTS OF POSITION TO ONE TO TWO MINUTES I MAY HAVE TO FURTHER RESTRICT THAT DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY. IF SOMEONE BEFORE YOU SAID ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO DO IS SAY I'M I CONCUR IN THE PREVIOUS STATEMENTS PROVIDED AND THAT WILL GIVE THE SAME HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON ME. AND MY COLLEAGUES AND ON THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COMMITTEE STAFF SO LET'S PROCEED FIRST WITNESS PLEASE NAME. OCT ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT IF THERE IS ANY THERE IS ONE IN YOUR POSITION PLEASE.

A. T. C. A. M. P. C. IN SOME CAPACITY OVER OVER MY SIX PLUS YOUR CAREER IN THE PHARMACY INDUSTRY. THEIR EFORTS OVER THE PAST FW YEARS NAVIGATING COAL THAT HAD BEEN MONUMENTAL BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEIR DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT TO SETTING AND ELEVATING INDUSTRY STANDARDS AS WELL AS REGULATING QUALITY MASSAGE THERAPY IN OUR STATE HAVE SHOWN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS IT RELATES TO MASSAGE THERAPY SCHOOLING PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE THERAPIST AND THE OVERALL PUBLIC THE M. T. V. AS PROVEN TO BE A LEADER AND PIONEER IN SETTING STANDARDS IN THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY SO A LITTLE PUSHING FOR A LICENSING PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE COSTLY DISRUPTED AND TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO IMPLEMENT IN HARMONY WITH MANY OF MY PEERS AND PROFESSIONALS IN THE INDUSTRY.

I AM A PAST GOVERNMENT RELATIONS CHAIR FOR THE AMERICAN MASSAGE THERAPY ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND I FULLY SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION AND ASK FOR A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION TO SEE A MTC. I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TO LICENSURE BILL. I'M VERY LEERY OF THE SUNRISE SUBMITTED BY A BMP ABM P. ADVOCATES FOR LICENSURE. ARE TO OUT OF STATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE INSURANCE TO MASSAGE THERAPIST BOTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE MASSAGE SITUATION AND REGULATION IN CALIFORNIA. C. CERTIFICATION IS BETTER THAN LICENSURE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. C. M. C. DOES NOT COST TAXPAYERS A DIME IT DOES NOT ADD TO THE STATE BUDGET AND IT DOES NOT ADD TO THE GROWING CALPERS EXPENDITURES. SECONDLY THE FEES FOR MASSAGE THERAPIST THAT WE PAY ARE REASONABLE AND MANY MASSAGE THERAPIST HERE. THAT THEY WILL GO UP EXPONENTIALLY WITH LICENSURE. CERTIFICATION DOES PROVIDE A CLEARLY DEFINED CRITERIA FOR MASSAGE PROFESSIONALS. THE PUBLIC CAN EASILY VERIFY THIS WE DON'T NEED A SCOPE OF PRACTICE LAW BECAUSE WE RARELY HARM OUR CLIENTS FOR OVER TEN YEARS THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A SCOPE OF PRACTICE LAW. AND THEY HAVE FAILED. AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ISSUES OF COMMERCIAL SEX THAT PLAGUE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. MY SISTER WILL NOT CHANGE PROSTITUTION HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR SEXUAL ASSAULT LICENSURE WILL NOT STOP LOCALITIES FROM PLACING ONEROUS EXPENSIVE AND EXCLUSIONARY LAND USE RESTRICTIONS USUALLY IN THE FORM OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT. OR ZONING LIMITATIONS ON OUR MASSAGE BUSINESSES. PANDEMIC IS BECAUSE INCOME LOSS AND HARDSHIP TO MASSAGE COMMUNITY WHAT WE NEED NOW IS BILITY EXTEND CMT C.
