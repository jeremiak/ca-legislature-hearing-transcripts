00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:56.067
FUTURE.

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:58.603
AND WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY JUST

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:00.338
SEEING THAT THAT RATE AND THAT

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:02.974
RETURN INTERVAL IS IS INCREASING

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.175
DRAMATICALLY IN THE IN THE

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:06.244
RECENT YEARS [inaudible]

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.246
WE'VE SEEN.

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.515
I DO TOO CLIMATE --

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:13.951
WILD SWINGS IN WEATHER PATTERNS

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:15.186
LESS SNOW IN THE HIGHER

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.288
ELEVATIONS --

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:19.223
LONGER --

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.192
AND MORE PERSISTENT DROUGHTS.

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:23.327
MORE -- WIND

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:27.064
EVENTS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:30.101
TO CONTROL FIRE UNDER SANTANA'S.

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:31.869
NORTHERN WINDS UP HERE IN THIS

00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:34.038
PART OF THE STATE AND SUNDOWNERS

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:35.840
AND THE CENTRAL COAST.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.675
MORE OF THOSE DAYS ARE COMING ON

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.177
AN ANNUAL BASIS THAN WE ARE ARE

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:42.647
USED TO SEEING --

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:44.382
AND THEN THE BONE DRY FUELS.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.917
AND WE'VE THE PERSISTENT DROUGHT

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:48.319
REALLY DRIED EVERYTHING TO BONE

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:49.487
DRY.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.756
OF THE LARGE LOGS THAT ARE OUT

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:54.058
IN THE FOREST THE TREES THE THE

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.359
HUNDRED AND NOW FORTY SEVEN

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.794
MILLION TREES THAT ARE DEAD IN

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.429
THE FORESTS OF THE OF THE

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.063
CENTRAL SIERRA.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.733
IT TAKES FOR THEM TO DRY OUT AND

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.335
IT TAKES MORE YEARS FROM THE FOR

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:06.504
THEM TO INCREASE IN MOISTURE

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:07.572
AGAIN.

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:09.106
SO THAT BONE DRY FUEL IS IS

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.942
BECOMING VERY AVAILABLE AND

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.877
MAKING A FIRE IS VERY DIFFICULT

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.479
TO CONTAIN.

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:15.947
A CLIMATE CHANGE HAS EXTENDED

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.315
OUR FIRE SEASON.

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.650
WE HAVE AN EARLIER START TO FIRE

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:22.086
SEASON AND AT A LATER AND AND

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:23.588
THAT'S THE PEAK SEASON AND WE'RE

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:25.656
FINDING THAT WE HAVE WILDFIRE

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:27.225
AND FIRE SEASON THAT'S CARRYING

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.292
THROUGHOUT THE SEIZE THAT

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.460
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.329
WE HAD A HUMBLE A FIRE IN

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:34.165
HUMBOLDT COUNTY THIRTY ACRES --

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:37.201
OVER THE THE A CHRISTMAS AND NEW

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:39.370
YEAR'S HOLIDAY PERIOD --

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.005
THAT'S UNHEARD OF IN THE WETTEST

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.374
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.475
HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:44.775
[inaudible]

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.811
SO.

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.279
WITH ALL OF THIS --

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:50.014
OF COURSE THE STATISTICS FROM

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:51.549
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SHOW

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:54.719
THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS.

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:55.987
AT THE TIME THE WORST FIRE.

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:58.256
SEASON IN HISTORY FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.924
AND THAT'S OF COURSE ARE ARE

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.193
WRITTEN HISTORY --

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.027
WHEN WE'VE BEEN STE --

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:05.696
WORKING TO SUPPRESS FIRES AND

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:06.330
AND SUCH.

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:07.965
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAME

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:11.235
AROUND AND DWARFED.

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.036
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BROKE ALL

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.672
RECORDS IN.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.907
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WOULD

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:18.476
COME TO A POINT WHERE --

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:20.645
FIREFIGHTERS THAT HAD THIRTY

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.079
PLUS.

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:24.448
YEAR LONG CAREERS --

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:27.218
AND RENDON THOSE CAREERS SOME

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.819
TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO THEY TALKED

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:30.288
ABOUT CAREER FIRES.

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.622
WHEN I STARTED THE FIRE SERVICE

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.391
IT WAS ALWAYS THIS CAREER FIRE

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:34.692
CONCEPT CAREER FIRE THIS THE THE

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.627
BIG?

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.796
ONE YOU SEE EVERYBODY ON THAT

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.132
WAS A FIRE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:41.699
FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.167
ACRES AND BURNED.

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.969
MAYBE --

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.470
ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.039
AND FIFTY STRUCTURES THAT WAS A

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.474
CAREER FIRE.

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.677
NOW WE'RE HAVING MULTIPLE CAREER

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:54.445
FIRES EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND I

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:58.215
CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME.

00:36:58.282 --> 00:36:59.617
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I'VE

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.752
HEARD ANYBODY SAY.

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:04.155
THAT'S A CAREER FIRE.

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.957
WE DON'T EVEN USE IT IN THE FIRE

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:07.458
SERVICE ANYMORE IT IS IT'S A

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:09.427
RELIC.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:11.362
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.998
VERY CONCERNING TO ME

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:14.298
[inaudible]

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:18.536
THE WATERSHED IMPACTS.

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:20.204
SO ALL OF THIS COMES WITH GREAT

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:20.938
IMPACTS.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:23.040
TO WATERSHED.

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:26.444
AND WE STARTED OFF --

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.044
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THE

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.946
TRAGIC EVENTS IN MINAS SETO --

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.548
THAT WERE ON THE HEELS OF THE OF

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.283
THE THOMAS FIRE AT THE TIME THE

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.919
LARGEST FIRE IN HISTORY --

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.821
AND THEN THEN THEN THE DEBRIS

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:39.523
FLOWS. TO KILL PEOPLE DESTROYED

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.959
HOMES AND BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:44.829
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AS WELL.

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:47.131
WEARE SEEING ARE AND AND AND TO

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:48.499
BE CLEAR WHAT THE STATE HAS

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:51.035
RESPONDED TO THE LARGE FIRES IN

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.870
THE LAST --

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.271
FIVE OR SO YEARS WITH --

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.841
WIRED WATER WATERSHED EMERGENCY

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.809
RESPONSE TEAMS THAT GO AND IT'S

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.412
CAL FIRE AND ON THE CALIFORNIA --

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.280
GEOLOGIC SURVEY SURVEY WORKING

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.149
TOGETHER --

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:05.783
AND OTHER AGENCIES TO DETERMINE

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.387
WHAT CRITICAL AREAS ARE THAT

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:13.190
THAT COULD SEE THE DAMAGE OR

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.692
HIGH HIGH FLOW OF WATER DEBRIS

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:16.227
FLOWS THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:17.595
OTHER DAMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.763
OCCURRED FROM.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.398
THE FIRE ITSELF AND THEN AND

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:20.898
THEN --

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.100
IDENTIFY THOSE AND IDENTIFY

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:24.802
MITIGATION MEASURES WHERE WHERE

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:28.506
POSSIBLE AND AND A FEASIBLE.

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:30.074
AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.776
AND THOSE TEAMS HAVE THEY HAVE

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:34.278
BECOME VERY CRITICAL TO OUR FIRE

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:36.547
RESPONSE AND ARE WATERSHED

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:39.050
EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.485
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS UTILIZE

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.154
THOSE SAME TYPES OF TEAMS TO

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.122
DETERMINE AHEAD OF AHEAD OF WILD

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:47.058
FIRES WHERE THOSE AREAS ARE WE

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:47.958
CAN DO THAT?

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.194
WE CAN AND ARE DOING THAT IN

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:51.595
SOME AREAS OF THE STATE --

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.831
PROACTIVELY TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:56.534
THE THE ISSUES MIGHT BE SHOULD

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.536
WE HAVE WATER A FIRE IN THOSE

00:38:58.602 --> 00:38:59.704
AREAS.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.905
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.540
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:05.309
MORE OF MOVING DOWN THE DOWN THE

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.012
ROAD.

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.580
IF YOU HAVEN'T.

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:12.817
READ JOHN MAKE FEES SHORT STORY

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:16.520
ON ON ON KIND OF WATER FLOW.

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.422
AND THE SENATE SAN GABRIEL

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.457
MOUNTAINS.

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.959
IN IN THE BOOK OR HIS BOOK.

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.828
THE CONTROL OF NATURE.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.263
I WOULD ITS A SHORT PASSAGE IT'S

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.765
AT THE BACK END OF THE BOOK AND

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.066
IT'S WORTH THE READ BECAUSE

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.702
IT'LL GIVE YOU A VERY VERY VIVID.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.371
PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:37.575
FIRE WHEN WE HAVE THESE THESE --

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.043
COULD KIND OF RAIN ABOUTS THESE

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.544
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS.

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:45.116
SOMETHING JUST TO TO THINK ABOUT --

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.651
SO I THINK THE WITH THE

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:50.621
WATERSHED A PIECE OF THIS --

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:53.057
KIND OF ADDING TO THE THE

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:56.527
LONGEVITY OF OF THE DAMAGE THAT

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.129
WILD FIRES ARE CAUSING --

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.830
ON THE LANDSCAPE.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.332
THE FINAL THING IT KIND OF COMES

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:03.367
BACK TO THAT CAREER FIRE COMMENT

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:06.504
THAT I MADE.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.472
WHILE THE WHILE THE WATERSHED

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:12.276
AND THE LANDSCAPE IS IS BEING.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:15.246
DAMAGED BY THESE THESE FIRES.

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.081
A AND THIS ACTIVITY.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:19.150
SO TO OUR OUR FIREFIGHTING

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:21.385
RESOURCES ARE OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:22.753
THAT GOES.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.922
TO RESPOND TO THESE EMERGENCIES

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.424
ARE ARE REALLY SEEING.

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:31.128
A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO THE THE

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:33.697
NUMBER AND THE LONGEVITY THAT

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:36.300
THEY'RE SPENDING ON INCIDENTS

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.701
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AGAIN.

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:41.272
NO LONGER IS THERE A CAREER FIRE.

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:43.874
THERE IS JUST CAREER SEASONS AND

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:46.443
IT JUST NEVER ENDS AND SO THAT'S

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.845
SOMETHING THAT THAT --

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.180
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON GOING

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:51.015
FORWARD IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:53.651

IMAGES.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.845
TO OF WHAT TOM JUST SO

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:21.812
ELOQUENTLY.

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.948
OF REPRESENTED AND I'M GONNA TRY

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.749
AND FOCUS A LITTLE MORE ON THE

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.652
WATER SIDE OF OUR WATER SHEDS

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:31.822
AND THE WILDLIFE AND HABITAT

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:33.123
COMPONENT.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.258
BUT THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:35.893
TO JUST.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.661
DO A LITTLE REVIEW.

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:38.462
IF I CAN GET THESE THIS QUICKER

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.297
TO WORK.

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:43.267
SO THIS IS A SLIDE THAT'S ABOUT

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.736
TWO YEARS OLD NOW BUT IT SHOWS

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.038
TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION.

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:48.806
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE RED

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:50.107
LINE THE TEMPERATURE IN

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.709
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN GOING UP AND

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:53.544
PRESET BOUNCES AROUND A LOT BUT

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.846
WE HAD THE FOUR YEAR DROUGHT.

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:56.847
THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A TWO YEAR --

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:59.316
A DOUBLE NORMAL RAINFALL YEAR

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:01.552
LAST YEAR OF WHICH I THINK

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.387
PROBABLY GREW THE THATCH WHICH

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:06.090
HELPED TO INMATE IGNITE MANY OF

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.124
THE FIRES THAT ARE.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:10.794
YOU WERE JUST DESCRIBING.

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:11.695
AND THEN I HAVE I HAVE A SERIES

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.564
OF MAPS YOU'RE THE TO JUST KIND

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.798
OF WALK THROUGH WHAT.

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.133
ARE SOME OF THE PROJECTED

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.602
FUTURES ARE AND I LIKE LOOKING

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.170
TOWARDS THE END OF CENTURY

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:21.805
BECAUSE THE THAT'S THE MOMENTUM.

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.642
EVEN IF WE MANAGED TO REDUCE OUR

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.877
EMISSIONS WE ARE STILL ON A

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.379
TRACK WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:31.115
A LOT OF CHANGE OVER THE THE

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:32.950
NEXT EIGHTY YEARS OR SO.

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.184
AND SO ON THE LEFT YOU SEE A

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.954
ANNUAL MEAN MINIMUM TURNED OUT

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.188
TO BE CRITICAL FOR MANY

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:39.423
ECOSYSTEMS --

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.191
AND MANY THINGS IN AGRICULTURE

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:42.459
AS WELL --

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:43.994
AND THEN IN THE CENTRAL PANEL

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:46.196
THAT'S THE CHANGE INTO --

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.431
AND CENTURY UNDER A WETTER

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:50.367
FUTURE AND ON THE RIGHT HAND

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.369
SIDE OF THE CHANGE. TO THE END

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:54.738
OF CENTURY UNDER A HOTTER FUTURE

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.407
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT SOME PLACES

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.708
ARE GOING TO BE.

00:42:57.775 --> 00:42:59.209
UNDER A PARTICULAR HAVE IF WE

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:02.212
STAY ON THE HOTTER TRACK.

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.581
OF LARGE PARTS OF THE CENTRAL

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.083
VALLEY WILL BE NINE AND DEGREE

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.319
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER ON

00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:10.587
NIGHT ON AVERAGE AT NIGHT SO

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.823
THAT'S THAT'S A PROJECTION THAT

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.124
THE THAT'S ON THE BOOKS NOW

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.459
RELATIVE --

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:16.727
TO THAT'S HOW MUCH WARMING WE

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.062
COULD SEE IN SOME PARTS OF WHAT

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.263
NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.299
I TRY TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:24.068
FAHRENHEIT AND MILES HERE. TO

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:24.969
PRECIPITATION THERE'S ON THE

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:25.736
LEFT THERE'S CALIFORNIA'S

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:27.037
PRECEPT AND WE KNOW ALMOST NEVER

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.872
HAVE AN AVERAGE YEAR RIGHT.

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.041
BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE YOU SEE

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.377
MORE OR LESS AND THEN UNDER A

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.079
WETTER FUTURE IN THE CENTER YOU

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:37.648
SEE A A A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE IN

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:38.282
THERE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:39.783
RAIN -- AND

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.419
UNDER A DRYER FUTURE BY THE

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:43.988
TRYING DOWN AND ONE OF THE

00:43:44.054 --> 00:43:45.155
THINGS TO NOTICE THAT IN OUR

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:46.824
WETTEST PART AS YOU.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.859
MENTIONED UP AROUND HUMBLE I WE

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.327
SEE A LOT OF DRY DOWN UNDER

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.495
UNDER ONE OF THESE.

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.731
CIRCULATION MODELS THAT HAS RAIN

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.666
NOT HITTING NORTHWESTERN

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.701
CALIFORNIA AS DEEPLY.

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.304
OKAY HERE'S RUNOFF OKAY WILL RUN

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.206
OFF A IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT'S

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.008
WHERE WE COLLECT THE WATER INTO

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:06.343
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT --

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.445
FUELS THE AGRICULTURE AND THE

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.280
THE CITIES IN THE NURSES THE

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:11.849
PEOPLE UP WATERS THE PEOPLE

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.017
SHALL WE SAY.

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.985
AND UNDER WHETHER FUTURE THERE'S

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:15.853
A LITTLE BIT MORE NOT

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:18.155
SURPRISINGLY UNDER DRYER FUTURE.

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.524
RUNOFF DECREASES OKAY WE EXPECT

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.959
THAT RIGHT [inaudible]

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:24.895
WELL OKAY.

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.830
AS WE GO ALONG WE'RE GOING SEE

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.832
MORE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AND MORE

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.167
DROUGHTS BECAUSE THINGS ARE

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:31.969
GETTING FLASHIER AND NOT ONLY

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.338
THAT BUT THE PULSE OF WATER MAY

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.306
BE MUCH MORE INTENSE SO NOT ONLY

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:38.409
WILL IT COME IN A SHORTER PERIOD

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.077
AND OUR FIRE SEASON BE LONGER.

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:42.146
BUT WE MAY SEE FLASH FLOODS OR

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:44.815
WE MAY SEE PULSES IN WHICH THE

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.717
OF RAINFALL THIS COMING IS

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:49.119
COMING MORE INTENSELY ON TO THE

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:49.753
LANDSCAPE.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.656
AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.158
HOW DO WE WATER HOW DO WE MANAGE

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:55.459
OUR WATER SHEDS.

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.494
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:59.897
FLEXIBILITY THE RESILIENCE TO

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:03.400
HANDLE BOTH PULSE ADVANCE AND

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:06.403
LONGER SEQUENCES OF DROUGHT.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.272
OKAY SNOW PACK WILL SNOW PACK

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:09.706
WHETHER IT GETS WETTER OR DRYER

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.375
OUR SNOW PACK IS EXPECTED TO

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.242
DECREASE --

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.711
THIS CURRENT STORM NONE YOU KNOW

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.280
REGRET IT REGARDLESS OF THIS

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:17.414
CURRENT STORM --

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.450
AND SO YOU SEE HERE THAT BECAUSE

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:21.819
TEMPERATURES ARE WARMING AND ONE

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:22.753
OF THE NICKNAMES OF THIS YEAR'S

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.954
IS THE MOTHER RANGE BECAUSE IT'S

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:26.090
A RELATIVELY WARM MOUNTAIN RANGE

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:26.523
IN.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.059
NORTH AMERICA --

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:29.359
THAT -- WILL

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:32.429
SEE A DECREASE SO THERE'S A

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:33.330
LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.667
WETTER DRIER FUTURE AND WHAT OUR

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.735
STORAGE OUR THIRD THIRD 30% OR

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:41.872
SO OF OUR WATER BUDGET THE COMES

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:42.106
AS SNOW.

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.240
WILL BE.

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.875
AND THEN HERE'S A A MEASURE OF

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:46.577
PLANT STRESS SO THE CLIMATIC

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:47.311
WATER DEFICIT AND IT'S

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.413
ESSENTIALLY HOW MUCH MORE WOULD

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.681
PLANTS LIKE --

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:52.249
TO EVAPORATE TRANSFEREE IF THEY

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:53.317
COULD -- IF

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:54.751
THE WATER WAS AVAILABLE IN THE

00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:56.653
SOIL AND SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.122
LEFT HAND SIDE.

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:59.590
YOU KNOW THE DESERT'S ARE REDDER

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.892
AND THE THE NORTH WEST CORNER IS

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:04.294
THE HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:05.662
CLIMATIC WATER DEFICIT.

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.897
AND AGAIN IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:11.001
WHETHER WE SEE MORE OR LESS RAIN

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.102
OF PRECIPITATION.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.337
PLANTS ARE GOING TO BE UNDER

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:16.473
HIGHER STRESS THAN THEY ARE NOW.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.076
FOR OUR FORESTS GRASSLANDS

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.477
SCRUBLANDS THEY'RE ALL GOING TO

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:21.979
EXPERIENCE HIGHER STRESS AND

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.914
THAT'S BECAUSE TEMPERATURE IS

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:26.383
RAMPING UP FASTER THAN A

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.318
INCREASE IN WATER WOULD WOULD --

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:30.354
ALLOW FOR THEM TO KEEP UP WITH

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.922
THIRTY VAPID TRANSPIRATION SO WE

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.725
EXPECT TO SEE STRESS COMING INTO.

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:37.895
OUR FORESTS MORE AND MORE AND

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:40.297
TRIGGERING EVENTS LIKE DROUGHT

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:42.799
COULD OCCUR.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:43.400
THEY MIGHT NOT THEY MIGHT NOT

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.168
NEED THE SAME INTENSITY OF

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:45.736
DROUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME LEVEL

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:48.172
OF A FACT IN TERMS OF MORTALITY

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.073
ON TREES AND STRESS ON TREES

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.575
THAT OPENS THE TREES UP.

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.877
FOUR BEATLES AND OTHER --

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:55.779
PATHOGENS RIGHT.

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:58.048
OKAY SO HERE'S SOME AN EXAMPLE

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.883
THAT SOME FORCE CHANGES ALREADY

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.084
HAPPENING THESE ARE --

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.220
BASED OFF OF NINETEEN THIRTY

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.588
SURVEY THAT WAS DONE --

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.623
IN CALIFORNIA AND COMPARING THE

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:11.094
MAP TO A CONTEMPORARY OF ABOUT.

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:11.962
TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT YOU SEE IS

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.197
THERE'S ABOUT ABOUT A THREE

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:28.078
HUNDRED FOOT TO TWO DEGREES.

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:31.548
OF NIGHT TIME WANTING TO DATE

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.450
THEIR RESPONSE TO THAT BUT IF

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.318
YOU HAVE A FIRE.

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.986
MAYBE THOSE FEELINGS ARE NOT

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.921
COMING BACK AND SO THIS STARTS

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:40.190
TO LEAD US INTO WE CAN EXPECT TO

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.959
SEE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION IN

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:44.795
OUR OUR FORESTS AND SPECIES MAY

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.430
BE A OF FORCE TREES MAY MOVE

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:47.231
AROUND.

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.766
AND THE MIX OF HARDWOODS TO CON

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:51.902
OFFERS IN THIS YEAR'S OR THE

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.070
LOCATIONS OF OUR BIG OAK

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.871
SAVANNAS THE BLUE OAK WOODLANDS

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:56.373
THAT RING THE CENTRAL VALLEY --

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.243
THOSE TYPES OF HABITATS MAY

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:00.644
BEGIN -- TO

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.446
CHANGE AND SO THEN THE QUESTION

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:05.215
ARISES OF WHERE DO WE WHERE

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:07.117
COULD WE RETAIN THEM.

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.919
AND WHERE ARE EVER PLACES THAT.

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:10.554
EVEN IF WE PUT ENORMOUS

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.556
RESOURCES IT MIGHT NOT LOOK THE

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.024
SAME FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW THAT

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.158
IT LOOKS TODAY.

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:16.994
AND HOW DO WE FIGURE THAT OUT

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.029
AND THEN HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.631
FROM A WATERSHED PERSPECTIVE.

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:21.231
AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR SOME

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:23.033
VERY COMPELLING STORIES LATER IN

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.369
THE DAY WITH REGARDS --

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.671
TO A DOCTOR NORSE AYE IDEAS OF

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:30.040
MANAGING FORESTS AND MANAGING

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:31.541
THE BLACK IN THE GREEN THAT WE

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:32.743
NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.411
REDUCE DEEP DEBRIS FLOWS AND GET

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:36.346
IN THERE AFTER FIRES WE ALSO

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:37.314
NEED TO MANAGE THE GREEN.

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:39.416
AND WE NEED TO DO THOSE THINGS

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:41.985
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SO I

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:44.921
HAVE TO TOP SLIDE WITH SOME TEXT

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:47.858
I APOLOGIZE WALK US THROUGH --

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:50.427
* SO WHERE EACH OF THESE SNOW

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:53.797
PACK WE LOSE OUR SNOW PACK

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:54.865
MEADOWS ARE GOING TO BE THE LET

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.800
THE NEXT SPONGES THAT COLD WATER

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.502
ON THE LANDSCAPE WE WANNA HOLD

00:48:58.568 --> 00:48:59.636
WATER ON THE LANDSCAPE AS MUCH

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.638
AS POSSIBLE. TO PREVENT IT THE

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:03.106
THE INCREASED SPEED OF OF

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.574
VELOCITY OF WATER MOVING THROUGH

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.443
OUR SYSTEMS NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.744
RETAIN IT FOR GROUND WATER

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:10.814
RECHARGE OR FOR ECOSYSTEM HEALTH.

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.816
FOR HUMAN USES SO MEADOWS BECOME

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.117
META RESTORATION BECOMES AN

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.519
INTERESTING.

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:17.754
OPPORTUNITY RIGHT CARRY IN AREAS

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:18.955
OF GETTING INTO THE RIGHT PARIAN

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.024
AREAS AND MAKING THEM MORE

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:22.292
RESILIENT --

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:25.729
TO WITHSTAND DEBRIS FLOWS AND TO

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.030
TO REDUCE EROSION BECAUSE

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:29.066
EROSION COMING INTO OUR DAM

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.168
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE A LARGE

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:32.936
PROBLEM SO HOW DO YOU --

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.438
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.872
WATERSHEDS HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.274
OF ALL OF THESE PIECES

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.276
CONTRIBUTE AND THEY RELATE TO

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:40.510
EACH OTHER WHILE THE HELL SLIPS

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:41.878
THAT'S WHERE YOU MIGHT BE

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.380
THINKING ABOUT --

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:44.981
MANAGING OUR WOODLANDS WELCOME

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.249
OTHER PLACES WE CAN PUT IN

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.452
SHADED FUEL BREAKS OTHER PLACES --

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:51.054
WHEN WE LOOK AT RECOVERING OF

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.623
FROM A YOUR TOWN RECOVERING LIKE

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.925
LIKE A PARADISE?

00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:56.093
WHAT COULD WE DO ON THE

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.527
LANDSCAPE THAT THAT BUILDS

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.795
RESILIENCE INTO THAT WHOLE

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:00.464
LANDSCAPE AND AND MAKES IT A

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.366
LITTLE BIT LESS SUSCEPTIBLE AND

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.533
ONE OF THE PLACES THAT YOU WANT

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.768
TO GO FIRST TO DO THAT?

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.104
IF YOU HAD HE GAVE ME A MILLION

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.138
BUCKS AND SIT AND SAID OKAY GO

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.840
OUT AND DO IT NOW WHAT PLACES

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.341
WHEN I PICKED BECAUSE I'M ONLY

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:12.576
GONNA GET A LITTLE TINY PART OF

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.311
THE FORCE THAT FIRST YEAR ON

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:14.711
THAT PERSONALLY.

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:17.013
RIGHT OKAY SO WE NEED TO THINK

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.316
ABOUT MANAGING OUR WATER SHEDS.

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:24.054
LOOKING AT THEM HOLISTICALLY --

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:27.391
IMPROVE THE WATER RETENTION ON

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.693
THESE LANDSCAPES BECAUSE OF THE

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.696
THE CLIMATE --

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.331
PRESSURES THAT ARE COMING.

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:35.532
SO I THINK THAT'S MORE OR LESS

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.168
WHAT'S ON THAT SLIDE.

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.302
AND LET'S JUMP TO THE LATTER THE

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.004
SECOND TO LAST.

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.205
SO.

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:43.106
HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.242
VEGETATION AND TWO SPECIES WELL

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:47.110
CHANGES IN THE SPECIES MIX ARE

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.780
COMING WILL WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:50.914
THAT IN DIFFERENT PLACES?

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:52.549
ARE AND SPECIES ARE GOING TO

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.184
MOVE TO TRY TO TRACK THEIR

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.752
SUITABLE CLIMATES.

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.521
THERE ARE THERE HOWEVER THERE

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.556
ARE PLACES WHICH APPEAR TO BE

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:00.824
MORE STABLE BY THE END OF

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.192
CENTURY AND THAT AT THOSE MAY BE

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.260
THE PLACES WHERE.

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.761
IF YOU HAVE A DOG FOR FORCE NOW

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.229
IT COULD STILL BE A DOG FOR FOR

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.564
US BECAUSE THE GENERAL

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:10.133
CONDITIONS ARE WITHIN THE RANGE

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.768
THAT DOG.

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.904
FOR OUR EXPERIENCE IS NOW AND

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.238
OTHER PLACES WERE DUG FOR CURSES

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.706
IT PROBABLY IS.

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:18.175
GOING TO BE OUTSIDE OF THAT

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.943
CLIMATE CONDITIONS.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.077
I AND THEN AND THOSE WOULD BE

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:22.112
THE ZONES OF TRANSITION AND SO

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.880
THE IF WE THINK OF THE LANDSCAPE

00:51:23.947 --> 00:51:25.916
IN TERMS OF WHERE THE REFUGIO

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:26.516
WHERE THE PLACES WE WANT TO

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.451
RETAIN.

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:29.352
WHERE THE PLACES THAT WE EXPECT

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:30.420
TO CHANGE AND MAYBE IT'S GOING

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.856
TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE --

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.892
TO TO SEE THAT CHANGE TO TRY.

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.661
TO THAT THE THOSE ARE --

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.029
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS --

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.997
AND AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.032
FOR COMMUNITIES.

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:43.233
A AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.001
WILDLIFE SIMILARLY THERE ARE

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.303
PLACES WHERE THE HABITATS THAT

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.071
ARE [inaudible]

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.506
ANIMALS.

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:51.241
OCCUPY OUR WILD ARE WILDLIFE

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:53.944
OCCUPIES OUR LOOK APPEAR TO BE

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.213
CLIMATICALLY STABLE OVER THE

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.647
NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AND THERE'S

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.449
OTHER PLACES WHERE --

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.251
THOSE SIMILARLY I MEANS THE

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:03.186
VEGETATION IS THE HABITAT OF WE

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.588
EXPECT THOSE PLACES TO CHANGE

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:05.589
AND SO THEY MIGHT NOT BE

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:07.824
SUITABLE FOR SOME SPECIES.

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:08.992
AND SO CORRIDORS AND

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.794
CONNECTIVITY LOOKING AT THE

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.661
LANDSCAPE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:14.064
OF OUR WHAT ARE THE PLACES THAT

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.832
YOU WANTED RETAIN IN SOME KIND

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.367
OF NATURAL CONDITION.

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.736
SO THAT SPECIES CAN MOVE FROM

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:23.139
WHERE THEY CURRENTLY CAN PERSIST.

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.808
TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY MAY

00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:26.209
BE ABLE TO PERSIST IN THE FUTURE.

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:29.079
THESE ARE A VERY ACTIVE RESEARCH

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:30.881
TOPICS AND THEY WERE ADDRESSED

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.215
IN THE FOURTH CLIMATE

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:33.917
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT TO SOME

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:36.052
DEGREE THEY ARE CAL FIRE HAS HAD

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.387
AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THESE

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.822
TYPES OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.690
CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.659
SIMILARLY SO I THINK THE

00:52:42.726 --> 00:52:44.194
AGENCIES ARE ALREADY ENGAGED

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.863
WITH MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.031
AND I'VE I APPRECIATE THE

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.466
OPPORTUNITY --

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:54.204
TO TRY TO PRESENT THOSE CONCERNS.

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.972
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:58.108
I WONDER IF YOU COULD GO INTO A

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:00.977
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT --

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.546
HOW AND PERHAPS BOTH OF YOU

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.247
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.483
THIS QUESTION HOW WORK CURRENTLY

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.019
PRIORITIZING THAT TED?

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:10.987
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE --

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:12.689
GIVEN THE FACT THAT EVEN WITH

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.424
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES --

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:15.692
OF THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED OVER

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:19.129
THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE STILL.

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:20.697
ARE LIMITATIONS.

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:23.700
AS DOES THE QUESTION --

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.503
IS RELATED TO MANAGEMENT I'LL

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.637
TAKE THAT FIRST.

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.806
FLEAS AND SO --

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.075
WHAT WHAT CAL FIRE IS DOING IS

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:33.109
IS --

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:35.178
THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT THAT

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.547
HAS COME THROUGH --

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.549
GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDING.

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:41.518
AND OTHER --

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.219
MECHANISMS --

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.355
WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:47.991
THAT TO WORKING DIRECTLY INTO --

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:51.795
WATERSHED BASS LANDSCAPE LEVEL

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:54.130
RESILIENCE WORK --

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.398
SO -- I'LL

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:56.333
AND I'LL COME BACK TO IT BUT

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.400
THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.668
MILLION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.036
EXPENDED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.104
YEARS --

00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:04.874
COMING GOING FORWARD WE HAVE --

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.143
TWO HUNDRED MILLION --

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.378
FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.679
TO TOTAL OF AN ADDITIONAL

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:10.880
BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:12.682
INVESTMENT IN THIS TYPE OF OF

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.884
LANDSCAPE LEVEL.

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.152
OF FOREST WORK.

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:19.122
AND BECAUSE SOME OF THAT WILL BE

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:21.091
FOCUSED IN IN IN AND AROUND

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.994
COMMUNITIES BUT BY AND LARGE THE

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.396
THE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS ARE

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.865
GOING TO BE OUT IN THE IN THE

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.667
BROADER LANDSCAPE WATERSHED

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:31.568
RELATED.

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:35.005
AND LOOKING TO ESTABLISH --

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.172
PRIORITIES --

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:37.907
THAT THAT.

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:40.076
ACT AS ANCHOR POINTS AND THEN

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.378
MORE WORK --

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.712
EXPANDS FROM.

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:45.315
ALL OF OUR EFFORTS IN --

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:47.317
IT DEVELOPING OUR GRANT PROGRAMS

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.519
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS --

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.721
AND HAVE HAVE BEEN TO THAT AND

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.423
WE HAVE BEEN DOING COMPETITIVE

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.425
GRANTS WE ALSO HAVE DONE BEEN

DETERMINED HOW MUCH IS GOING TO

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:51.574
GO -- TO THE

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.442
LOCAL --

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:55.178
VERSUS THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL --

WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S IT'S

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:49.566
BROKEN ALMOST EVENLY --

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:52.168
THEIR SPEND ABOUT FIFTY TO ADD A

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.670
LITTLE BIT LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

50% -- IN

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:58.441
THE THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL AND THEN

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.510
THE OTHER IN IN THE KIND OF

PREVENTION TYPE OF OF GRANTS --

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:16.693
IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT --

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:20.463
NOT A FORTY THAT HUNDRED AND TEN

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.899
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:24.934

IT HAS GONE ON TO FEDERAL LANDS

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:30.573
IN THOSE FEDERAL LANDS WHILE

THEY ARE NEAR COMMUNITIES THEY

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:34.410
ARE THEY ARE MORE OF THAT

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:36.012
LANDSCAPE LEVEL --

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.580
IT'S A FISCAL YEAR GOAL SO WE WE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:59.382
WE AREN'T ON A CALENDAR YEAR FOR

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.884
THAT FOR THE FUELS TREATMENT.

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.953
THAN THE FUELS TREATMENT IS --

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.224
BOTH PRESCRIBED BURNING OF AND

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.826
OTHER TYPES OF OF TREATMENT SO

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.728
THAT BE MECHANICAL OR HAND

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.464
CUTTING PILING BURNING THOSE

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.798
KIND OF THINGS --

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.733
ALL WOULD BE IN THE OTHER AND WE

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.402
HAVE A WE HAVE A STATEWIDE GOAL

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.572
THIS YEAR OF TWENTY THOUSAND

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.540
ACRES OF THE OTHER TYPE OF FUELS

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:25.608
TREATMENT.

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.543
AND FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.612
ACRES FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.147
WHICH IS NOT THE SIXTY BUT

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.716
THAT'S WE'RE SIXTY IS ARE ARE

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:36.586
PROJECTED GOAL IN THE FUTURE.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:39.489
THIS YEAR WE HAVE A FORTY FIVE

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.356
THOUSAND ACRE.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.992
GOAL AND AND WE'RE ABOUT 40% OF

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:43.526
THE WAY THERE WERE WORKING

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.761
TOWARD.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:48.531
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.299
QUESTIONS MR STONE.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.101
THANK YOU PROFESSOR ITCHING YOU

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:52.869
YOU MENTIONED THE PONDEROSA

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.804
PINES AND I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.272
WITH THEM IN THE SIERRA.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:59.208
BUT ON THE IN THE COASTAL AREAS

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:02.044
ON THE THE AGING COASTAL MARINE

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.045
TERRACES THAT ARE THEIR

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.614
PONDEROUS IS ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.816
PART OF THE SAND HILLS HABITAT

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.017
AND THAT'S A HABITAT THAT'S

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.519
DESIGNED TO BURN.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.254
IN ORDER TO PERPETUATE AND TO

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.357
SURVIVE IT HASN'T BAD BECAUSE

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.925
IT'S ALSO AN AREA UNDER TRUMP.

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:16.659
MEDICINE DEVELOPMENT PRESSURE

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.594
AND SO BEING ABLE TO MANAGE IT

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.630
THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:22.465
BECOMES A CHALLENGE.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.800
WHICH IS WHY LOOKING AT THE THE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.469
NATURE THE FORCED YOU BROUGHT UP

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.904
IN THE NATURE THAT THE FORCE MAY

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.506
END UP BEING AND BY YOUR SLIDES.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.141
ARE FORCED TO REALLY STRUGGLING

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:32.975
BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT WERE

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:36.045
MADE OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.513
IN HOW WE MANAGE FORESTS OR

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.315
DIDN'T MANAGE FORESTS.

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.850
AND IF WE'RE LOOKING.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.852
TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE DO FORCE

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.654
TREATMENTS NOW.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.522
WHICH IS YES FUEL REDUCTION BUT

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.957
IT'S ALSO GETTING THE FORCE TO

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.126
FUNCTION AS FORCED USED TO SO

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:52.161
THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE BIRDS THAT

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.996
THEY CAN MANAGE BECAUSE WHEN WE

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:56.966
CLEAR CUT WHEN WE RE PLANTED

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.601
HIGHER DENSITIES OR WITH THE

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.336
WRONG TYPE TO TREES OR THE WRONG

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:01.938
TYPES OF MANAGEMENT.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:04.006
THAN WERE JUST GROWING TREES TO

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.875
GROW TREES BUT NOT CREATING

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.443
FUNCTIONAL FORESTS.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.111
SO HOW DO WE TAKE.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.046
OR GUESS WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.715
SCIENCE OF THAT AS WE'RE DOING

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.884
FORCED RESTORATIONS NOW.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.553
AND LOOKING AT FUTURE IMPACTS.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.321
TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY YEARS DOWN

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.755
THE LINE WHEN THE SYSTEMS ARE

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:20.923
DESIGNED TO FUNCTION BECAUSE THE

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.358
WORK THAT NOW IS GOING TO WORK

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.326
OVERTIME.

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:24.860
HOW DO WE HAVE A SENSE THAT

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:26.362
THOSE RESTORATIONS THE WORK

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:26.862
WE'RE DOING TO PROTECT

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:30.132
WATERSHEDS TO MANAGE FORESTS NOW?

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.167
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.902
RIGHT THINGS BECAUSE OF HOW

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.972
THOSE FORCE MAY CHANGE OVER TIME.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:36.839
TO HELP.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:40.309
AND WE DEVELOPED ANY THOUGHTS ON

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:43.412
ABILITY TO PREDICT.

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.013
HOW MUCH TIME ARE YOU GETTING

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.681
THE?

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.750
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION --

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.352
I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S AN AREA OF

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:52.855
VERY ACTIVE INTEREST AND WELL.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:53.990
POINTING TO THE SAND HILLS I

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.691
CAN'T RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THAT

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.660
WITHOUT LOOKING AT MAPS AND

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.328
GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.596
ORIENTATION.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:03.099
GENERALLY SPEAKING OF FORESTRY

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:06.702
HAS USED SEEDS OWNS ARE AS WE

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.005
WHICH ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.072
THOUSAND FOOT BY ONE HUNDRED

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:11.574
MILE BLOBS ON A MAP THAT WERE

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.476
ORIGINALLY DRAWN IN NINETEEN

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:14.844
FORTY IN THE MOST RECENT VERSION

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.212
IN.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:19.081
NINETEEN SEVENTY AND THE IDEA IS.

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.816
THE THE SEEDS THAT WE MIGHT

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.518
PLANT I MEAN THERE THERE THERE

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.119
THERE COULD BE A BOTTLENECK

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.488
WHERE WE WE DON'T HAVE SEATS

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.923
OKAY SO WE THE ASSUMPTION IS --

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.557
YEAH WE CAN GO ON WE COULD DO

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.760
PLANTINGS WELL THE WAY THAT THAT

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:33.529
OPERATION WORKS IS THERE ARE.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.398
OF A THERE'S A NURSERY THE LA

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.133
MORAN NURSERY CAL FIRES OF

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:39.769
ACTIVATING IN DAVIS THAT HAS A

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:42.004
OF FROZEN BROOM WITH.

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.739
THOUSANDS OF BOXES OF SEEDS IN

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.841
IT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE AT THE

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:47.576
INSTITUTE FOR FORCED GENETICS UP

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.712
IMPOSSIBILITY FOR SERVICE THAT'S

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.846
ONE OF THE BIG ONES THERE'S A

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.948
NUMBER OF OF PRIVATE INDUSTRY

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:53.282
ONES AS WELL.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.250
BUT PEOPLE.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:58.087
THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THE SEEDS

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:00.289
GO OUT INTO AND AND THEY GET THE

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:01.390
PINE CONES THEY BRING THEM IN

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.191
AND THOSE ARE RECORDED.

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.592
IN A A RATHER.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.895
OLD SYSTEM OF ITS IN THIS SEEDS

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:07.530
OUT.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.265
AND PLANTING WITH A TAKING THOSE

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:10.800
SEEDS AND PLANTING THEM AGAIN IN

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.368
THE SAME SEATS OWN IS WHAT IS

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.169
NOW.

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.904
LOOKED AT BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.305
THINK ABOUT WELL IF YOU HAD.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.106
A BIG FIRE IN THE MIDDLE

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:21.010
ELEVATION AND YOU WERE GOING --

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.144
TO TRY TO GROW PONDEROSA IS

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:23.846
THERE YOU MIGHT WANT PONDEROSA

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.681
SEED FROM LOWER ELEVATIONS AND

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:27.650
PLANTED AT MIT ELEVATION IN

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.385
ANTICIPATION OF BECAUSE THOSE

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.619
GUYS WERE EXPOSED TO WARMER

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:31.287
CONDITIONS.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:32.688
AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.824
ANTICIPATE THAT'S ONE THE OTHER

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:35.991
THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE MIGHT

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.661
CHANGE THE MIX SO THE THAT.

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.096
I'M CONVINCED THAT IN THIS YEAR

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.230
AS THERE'S PARTS OF IT THAT ARE

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.833
BECOMING MORE HARDWOOD DOMINATED.

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.801
AND SO PERHAPS THEN --

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:48.237
NOT ONLY GOING BACK IN PLANTING

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:50.039
THE MOST.

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:50.940
OF WHAT LOVING CHURCH --

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.641
CONNOR FOR TREES BUT HAVING A A

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.243
FEW MORE HARDWOODS IN NOW TO

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.511
RECOGNIZING THE HEART WHICH MAY

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.279
COME INTO THEIR AS A NATURAL

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.781
TRANSITION.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:06:59.682
AND MAY BE CHANGING YOUR SEATS

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.650
STOCK MIX AS YOU'RE GOING IN TO

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.652
DO A RESTORATION OF THAT WOULD

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:06.756
BE AN EXAMPLE OF ANTICIPATORY.

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:08.958
PLANTINGS THE THE MOST RADICAL

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:10.092
ONES -- IN

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.328
WHICH ARE MORE ACADEMIC THAN

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.431
THAN -- REAL

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:19.802
ARE -- WHAT --

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.371
WE SERPENTINE AS OUR STATE ROCK

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:25.207
AND WE HAVE MAYBE. 25% OF ALL OF

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.777
OUR ENDEMICS OF OVER A THOUSAND

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.145
SPECIES LIVE ON SERPENTINE WELL

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.913
THOSE ARE LITTLE ISLANDS OF

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.481
UNUSUAL --

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:35.050
CONDITIONS RIGHT AND ARE THE

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:37.119
PLANTS THAT GROW ON THIS ONE

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.220
LITTLE ONE THAT'S OVER IN THE

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.622
BAY AREA GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.323
MIGRATE TO SOME OTHER PLACE.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.324
WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:42.892
GONNA HAVE TO BE PICKED THE

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.326
SEEDS ARE GONNA BE PLANTED IN

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.728
THAT OTHER PLACE AND THAT WOULD

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:46.729
BE MUCH MORE.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.564
IF THAT'S IS A RAGING DEBATE

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.733
ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S GOOD OR BAD

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.234
WE MOVE SPECIES AROUND THE GLOBE.

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.670
ALL THE TIME THAT'S THE REALITY

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.172
BUT OF I WOULD SAY THOSE ARE

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.306
THAT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE THE

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:01.977
STATE OF THE SCIENCES NOW IS.

01:08:02.044 --> 01:08:02.678
I KNOW IT EITHER AND THAT'S YEAH

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.312
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GETTING

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:04.647
AT IS BECAUSE IF WE'RE WE'RE

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:05.548
MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE FORCED

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:06.816
GROW SLOWLY.

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:07.616
AND OF WAS WERE MAKING

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.285
RESTORATION DECISIONS NOW WE'RE

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.620
GONNA BE END UP IN FOREST'S IN

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:12.588
THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS THAT

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.990
MAY NOT BE FUNCTIONING BECAUSE

01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:15.991
OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES.

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:16.592
I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:18.327
THE MECHANISMS TO LOOK AHEAD AT

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:19.929
WHAT WE EXPECT THOSE FORCED TO

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.664
FUNCTION OR HOW THEY EXPECT THEM

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:22.832
TO FUNCTION.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:26.202
IN THAT CHANGED ENVIRONMENTS.

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.471
AS WE DO RESTORATIONS NOW OR

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.407
WE'RE GOING TO AND REALLY UNITED

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:33.142
THE AND SAYING AND AND HAVING

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.043
SIMILAR KINDS OF PROBLEMS

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.078
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF THE

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:37.847
ABILITY THE FORCE OF FUNCTIONS

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.814
FORCE.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.883
IT IS CAL FIRE YOUR SHOE

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:41.750
DIVISION.

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.018
AS YOU DO RESTORATIONS ARE YOU

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.653
ARE YOU STARTING TO LOOK AT SOME

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.722
OF THESE CONNECTIONS I I'M I'M

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:48.891
GLAD YOU ASKED BECAUSE SOME --

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:53.462
IT AND THE SIDE --

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.431
THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING AND WE

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:57.466
HAVE TO LOOK AT AT A DIFFERENT

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.068
WAY WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.536
LOOKING AT REFORESTATION.

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.037
OF OF INSURING THAT THERE'S

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.405
GOING TO BE FORCE THAT COMES

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:05.808
FROM THAT ACTIVITY WE DON'T

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:06.442
WANNA JUST PLANT TREES FOR THEM

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:07.376
TO DIE --

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.345
BECAUSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.613
THEIR CLIMATE THEIR MICRO

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.047
CLIMATE WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE

01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:14.617
SO -- WE DID

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:15.584
IT.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:18.120
OVER A YEAR AGO NOW TO START A

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.289
WHOLE PROCESS OF REDEFINING WHAT

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.458
ARE SEEDS ZONES ARE AND WHAT

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:23.859
THEY NEED TO BE.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.427
BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE SEA THAT

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.196
WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.532
DETERMINING WHAT THE BEST

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:29.832
[inaudible]

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.834
PLATE LIKELY.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.536
MIGRATION OF WHERE THAT SEED

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:35.804
GOES BACK ON TO THE LANDSCAPE

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:38.674
SHOULD BE SO SO ARE PLANTING

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:39.708
GUIDES.

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:42.344
AND OR OR PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.280
THAT AT THE LA AROUND --

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.082
RESEARCH AND SEED SEED BANK AND

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.784
NURSERY --

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.452
ARE WORKING TOWARD THAT --

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:51.987
AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:55.524
DOES THAT IS THE WAY WE WILL BE --

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:58.494
REENTER INTRODUCING THE OVER

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.930
OVER THE LAST DECADES BACK INTO

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.598
THE LANDSCAPE --

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.466
GOING FORWARD THEY WILL BE GOING.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.368
NOT TO WHERE THE MOTHER TREES

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.237
CAME FROM THEY WILL PROBABLY BE

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.372
GOING UP SLOPE.

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.040
AND PROBABLY FURTHER NORTH

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:11.340
[inaudible]

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.975
YEAH.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.410
OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:16.045
ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOLLOWED BY

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.079
ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.948
EGGMAN.

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.216
THANK YOU CHIEF --

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:21.884
ONE OF THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IT

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.253
IS THE THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.788
AND THE DIRECT FUNDING TO ANCHOR

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:26.622
POINTS ARE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.223
THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:28.824
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE BIG

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.558
PICTURE.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.427
SO IT ISN'T JUST THOSE WHO HIRE

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:33.295
THE BEST GRANT WRITERS --

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.997
WHO GET THE GRANTS BUT LOOKING

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.732
AT THE BIG PICTURE TAKING ON

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.100
THAT RESPONSIBILITY APPRECIATE

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.368
THAT --

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:42.504
GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND THE

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.039
INTENSELY THE MOST RECENT FIRES.

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.274
HOW MANY FIRE PREVENTION

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.875
PROJECTS?

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:47.943
WORKING AT BIG COMPLETED EACH

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.613
YEAR.

01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:51.880
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.083
A MOVING TARGET EACH ONE OF OUR

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.918
UNITS WE HAVE TWENTY ONE UNITS

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.886
PLUS WE HAVE --

01:10:57.953 --> 01:11:00.322
SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES SO IN IN

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.925
EACH OF THOSE --

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.226
TWENTY SEVEN AND ADMINISTRATIVE

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:06.662
AREAS --

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.497
THEY HAVE A FIRE PLAN --

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:11.000
AND IT'S A CERTIFIED PLAN AND

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.635
AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF PROJECTS

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:15.104
SOME SOME TIMES --

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.905
THE PROJECTS ARE --

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:19.842
SCATTERED SO WE COULD BE DOING --

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.477
IN SOME AREAS.

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:22.745
OR IN SOME COUNTIES OR MULTIPLE

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:23.879
COUNTIES YOU MAY HAVE THIRTY

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.014
PROJECTS THEY GET DONE IN A YEAR

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.150
IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT --

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.885
OTHERS MIGHT HAVE JUST ONE OR

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.120
TWO BECAUSE THEY'RE BIGGER AND

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.322
MORE COMPLEX PROJECTS THAT

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.990
THEY'RE WORKING ON SO.

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.759
THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PROJECTS

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.494
THAT GETS DONE --

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.365
IS IS KIND OF IT CHANGES VERY

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.334
DRASTICALLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR --

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:47.336
THE ACREAGE THAT THAT WAS

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.304
MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY --

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:50.806
THAT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND THEY

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.341
WERE TRYING TO GET TO THIS YEAR

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.876
THAT'S ENCOMPASSING ALL THOSE

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:55.978
PROJECTS AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:58.447
IS IS FOR A A MAN A MEASURE IS

01:11:58.514 --> 01:11:59.915
IS TO TRY AND UTILIZE THE

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.750
ACREAGE THAT IS BEING TREATED.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.419
AND THEN USE THE THE FORCE

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.487
CARBON PLAN AS OUR GUIDING

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:09.625
DOCUMENT TO TO IDENTIFY WHAT CAL

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.192
FIRES.

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:13.696
AND OUR CAPACITY WHAT CAL FIRES --

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:17.933
TARGET IS IN THE KERR'S ANNUALLY --

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.039
OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:24.840
ACRES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.975
ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE --

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.310
IN IN ALL.

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.645
TYPES OF TREATMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:33.649
CAL FIRE PRIVATE AND AND OTHER

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.317
LOCAL -- AND

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.752
THEN THE FOR SERVICE IS ALSO

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:39.521
TRYING TO GET TO A FIVE HUNDRED

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.756
THOUSAND ACRE NUMBER. FOR A

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.025
TOTAL OF A MILLION ACRES ACROSS

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.226
THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE OF

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.095
CALIFORNIA --

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:49.631
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT DECADE.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:52.067
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST HINDRANCES

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.169
TO COMPLETING THE COMMUNITY FIRE

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:55.804
PROTECTION PROJECTS?

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.706
COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.875
PROJECTS --

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:01.343
MOST OFTEN COVER.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:04.513
MANY MANY SMALL LANDOWNERS AND

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.782
GETTING BY AND FROM ALL OF THE

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:07.883
LANDOWNERS --

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:11.286
IS ONE OF THE BIG HINDRANCES.

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:14.957
ANOTHER ONE THAT SLOWS PROJECTS

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.391
BUT DOESN'T KICKING I KEEP THEM

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.427
FROM BEING DONE IS IS THE SEQUEL

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:21.029
PROCESS SO WE WE DO HAVE A

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.664
SEQUEL PROCESS THAT.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:27.136
THAT TAKES IN SOME CASES --

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:27.736
TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.171
COMPLETE --

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:33.408
AND IT SLOWS IMPLEMENTATION

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.477
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WE DON'T

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.613
GET TO THOSE PROJECTS BUT

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.581
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE --

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.083
AND THEN SMALL LANDOWNERS THAT

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.518
ARE SKEPTICAL --

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.419
IN SOME CASES OF SEE CgA AND

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.155
AND SKEPTICAL OF WANTING

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.158
GOVERNMENT --

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.059
ENTERING ONTO THEIR LAND --

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.494
AND THE SCRUTINY THAT COMES WITH

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:56.298
THAT THAT THAT IS A LOCAL --

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:58.700
CONCERN THAT WE THAT WE RUN INTO

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.602
AROUND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.237
THAT WE TRY AND DO THESE THESE --

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.772
FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:07.709
ACTIVITIES AND THANK YOU.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:07.976
THANK YOU.

QUESTION I NEED TO LEAVE BEFORE

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:14.783
TOO LONG AND I WOULD ASK MY

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:15.284
COLLEAGUES --

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.951
THINK MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.186
PRESSING MOST FASTENED QUESTION

ABOUT THE SMALL.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.659
THE SMALL PROJECTS --

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:26.028
THE SMALL LANDOWNERS SO JUST UP

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:26.628
IN THE WOODS I'VE SEEN A WHOLE

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:29.665
LOT OF STOCKTON TIMBER --

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:31.900
SO THAT WAS GONNA BE MY QUESTION --

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:34.169
LONG LINES OF MISS REYES HOW HOW

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.404
WE WORKING TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.638
THAT TIMBER OUT ARE YOU GOT A

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.106
LOT OF PLANS OUT THERE AND THEN

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.708
A LOT OF SMALL LANDOWNERS AND SO

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:40.275
YOU'VE GOT.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.710
MULTIPLE SYSTEMS WORKING AT THE

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.846
SAME TIME DO WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.347
RESOURCES TO GET THE TIMBER OUT

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.615
SOMEWHERE ELSE SO IT'S NOT JUST

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:47.583
PILED UP.

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:48.817
AND THEN ALONG THE LINES OF

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:50.619
MISTER STONE.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:51.753
ALSO WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.723
HOW SEEDS SPREAD.

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.058
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:59.328
ON THE ANIMAL POPULATION THAT IS

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:01.296
ALSO THE BIRDS AND THE SQUIRRELS

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.831
AND THE INSECTS THAT SPREAD THE

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.200
SEEDS -- AND

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.436
ALSO OUR OUR THE WILDLIFE LOOKS

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:08.837
DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT LOOKED A

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:10.472
DECADE AGO IN PARTS OF THE

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:11.506
SIERRA --

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:12.507
ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT AND

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.142
TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.144
AS WE MAKE OUR PLANTS.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.714
BOTH VERY GOOD QUESTIONS ARE

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.684
TAKING THE FIRST QUESTION ON ON

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.152
SMALL LANDOWNERS THAT HAVE AN

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:26.288
ACCUMULATION OF OF LOGS AND

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.789
DIFFERENT THINGS --

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.424
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I I JUST

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.126
WANT TO QUALIFY THIS --

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.128
DEFENSIBLE SPACE THE AREA THAT

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.097
IS REQUIRED FOR A LANDOWNER TO

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:36.231
CLEAR AROUND THERE.

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:37.900
STRUCTURE THERE HABITABLE

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:38.834
STRUCTURE THAT'S THEIR

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.802
RESPONSIBILITY --

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:44.206
AND SO THERE ARE SOME PLACES

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.241
WHERE THERE'S DISADVANTAGED --

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.110
GRANT A CAPABILITIES STATE TO

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.379
HELP WITH SOME OF THOSE COSTS

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.747
BUT IT REALLY IS THE THE

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:53.282
LANDOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.550
WE GET INTO KIND OF THE THE THE

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.152
NEXT.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.054
TIER OF THAT OUTSIDE OF THAT

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.856
DESPITE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND WE

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:02.858
HAVE ACCUMULATION OF WOODY

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.826
MATERIAL WHETHER IT'S STILL

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:09.331
STANDING OR OR CUT AND AND ON

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.632
THE GROUND --

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:13.902
WITH THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.103
FOR FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.838
WITH WITH GROUPS THAT ARE

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.006
INTERESTED IN DEALING WITH THAT

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.675
ON THOSE FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:22.444
GRANT OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE --

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.946
THEY'VE BEEN USED IN THE PAST

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:26.782
FOR CHIPPING PROGRAMS AND OTHER --

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.450
IN SOME CASES --

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.185
SUBSIDIZING THE THE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.887
TRANSPORTATION OF CERTAIN

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.122
MATERIALS TO BIOMASS PLANTS AND

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.525
OR OTHER TYPES OF OF UTILIZING

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:40.896
PLANTS --

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:42.597
BUT THAT IS IS THAT IS THAT THAT

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.566
IS AN ISSUE FOR US AND THIS THAT

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:46.601
SMALL LANDOWNER PIECES WHERE WE

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.303
FEEL CAL FIRE FEELS THAT WITH

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.371
THAT.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.941
WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEED AND

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.544
PROBABLY THETHE THE GREATEST

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.346
CHALLENGE --

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.348
TO TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO --

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.416
IN IN MOVING TO THAT LARGER

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.218
NUMBER OF OF ACRES TREATED AND

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.554
ON ON THE ANIMAL POPULATION I AM.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.090
I DO WANT TO KICK THIS TO JIM I

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.057
DON'T WANT --

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.961
TO SURE COULD THE THE THAT I

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:13.628
DON'T I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:15.297
THE CAL FIRE DOESN'T THINK OF

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:16.431
THIS BUT THIS IS ANOTHER --

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.734
LANDOWNER AND LAND MANAGER

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.068
DECISION --

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.570
AND WE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:23.105
WITH LANDOWNERS.

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.639
ABOUT THE VALUE OF DIFFERENT

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:29.011
TREES FOR MAST OR FOR FEED --

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:32.314
FOR BIRDS OR OR DIFFERENT THINGS --

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:34.816
AND SO WE WE DO TALK ABOUT THAT

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:35.884
WHEN WE'RE HAVING --

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.286
KIND OF FORESTRY DISCUSSION WITH

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.489
A LANDOWNER AND WE ENCOURAGE

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:43.392
THEM TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:47.496
BUT RELATED TO SPECIFICS I THINK

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:48.463
I MAKE THAT TO JIM [inaudible]

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.066
OKAY OF WHEN YOU HAVE A REALLY

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:54.002
BIG WILD FIRE.

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.838
IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT THE LOCAL

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.407
SEED SOURCES.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:01.309
AND THE BIRDS THAT MIGHT BRING

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:04.079
THEM ARE GOING TO RE VEGETATE

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:04.980
THAT AREA.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.581
ARE AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:07.382
STUDIES --

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:08.884
THERE WAS A BIG ONE ON THE RIM

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:09.951
FIRE WHERE THEY WERE LOOKING AT

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.586
A A WOODPECKER AND AND SAYING

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.021
HOW MANY.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:13.822
WOULD YOU HAVE IN HERE AND YOU

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.891
WOULD THEY BE BRINGING IN ACORNS

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.225
OR WHATEVER AND AND YOU KNOW

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.727
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT WE

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.362
NEED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE WE'RE

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.063
NOT GOING.

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.297
TO JUST BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.667
AREAS TO NATURALLY REGENERATE OF

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:28.303
THE THE RISK --

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.471
FOR TO AT THE VERY LEAST THE

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.039
RISK FOR DEBRIS FLOWS IS VERY

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:32.908
HIGH FROM THOSE AND SO YOU YOU

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:34.176
NEED TO GET IN THERE AND DO

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:34.476
SOMETHING.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.411
SO -- IN

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.246
TERMS I I THINK THAT'S MAYBE

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:41.917
MORE OF A MOTIVATION FOR ACTIVE

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:42.584
RESTORATION.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.719
IN TERMS OF MONITORING THE

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:45.987
POPULATIONS OF SPECIES.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.556
YOU KNOW I THINK THE I HAVEN'T

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:50.592
HEARD OF SORT OF FOLLOW ON

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.260
STUDIES WE KNOW WHAT A LOT OF

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.995
THE SPECIES DO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.230
FISH AND WILDLIFE IS.

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:57.699
REALLY QUITE VERSED IN THE

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.334
INDIVIDUAL SPECIES FOR EXAMPLE

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:02.204
MANY DEER POPULATIONS MIGRATE UP

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.171
AND DOWN THE SIDES OF THE

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.473
MOUNTAIN --

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:05.140
JUST LIKE THAT OF AMERICANS USED

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:05.607
TO DO.

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.943
AT AND SO --

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.011
WE WE KNOW WHAT A LOT OF THE

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:10.879
THAT SORT OF THE NATURAL

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:12.314
TRAJECTORIES ARE MAINTAINING

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.250
CONNECTIVITY ON THE LANDSCAPE.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.351
AND WHICH IS.

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.520
DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.489
FROM FOREST SERVICE TO PRIVATE

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.691
LAND TO MAYBE TO YOU A RIVER

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.759
CORRIDOR THAT'S GOT SOME OTHER

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.961
JURISDICTION --

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.929
BUT YOU WANT TO TRY TO RETAIN

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:31.066
SOME NATURAL VEGETATION ACROSS

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.033
THAT.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.802
ALL ALONG THAT CORRIDOR THAT

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.237

ARE WIDELY POINTED TO FOR A

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.106
CLIMATE CHANGE THAT.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.609

WELL AS A REPORT WE PUBLISHED

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:59.781
ONLINE IN NOVEMBER ABOUT HOW CAL

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.549
FIRE IS SPENDING RECENT --

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.184
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.586
FOR FOREST HEALTH.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.887
SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF THE

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.489
HAND OUT AGAIN THIS IS JUST

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.090
BACKGROUND OUR FORESTS ARE

01:22:09.157 --> 01:22:10.525
IMPORTANT AND THERE AN UNHEALTHY

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.394
CONDITION I THINK WE'VE HEARD

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.862
THAT ALREADY TODAY.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.563
I THIS IS ONE POLICY AREA THAT

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.865
YOU ARE FACING THAT THERE

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:17.932
ACTUALLY IS A PRETTY BROAD

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.601
CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:20.735
DONE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.604
THE AREAS THAT THAT YOU ARE

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.706
FACED WITH AN CHALLENGES YOU'RE

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:25.006
FACED WITH.

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.941
DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE AREAS BUT

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:28.276
THERE IS A PRETTY BROAD

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.678
CONSENSUS ABOUT THE TYPES OF

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:31.613
ACTIVITIES THAT WILL YIELD

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.148
PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:34.449
I THINK THAT THE FIGURE HERE ON

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:35.850
PAGE ONE SHOWS SOME OF THE

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.085
CHALLENGES WERE FACING YOU CAN

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.520
SEE THE STATE'S SHARE OF

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.155
OWNERSHIP OF THE STATE'S OF

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.357
FORCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS QUITE

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:44.159
SMALL -- SO

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.727
THAT PRESENTS CHALLENGES BUT

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.262
ALSO OPPORTUNITIES THE STATE

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.596
CAN'T GO IN AND FIX THE PROBLEM

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.165
ALL BY ITSELF EVEN IF IT WANTED

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:50.965
TO IT TAKES A LOT OF

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:52.534
COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION I

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.069
THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM THAT --

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.603
ARE ON THE PANEL THAT WE

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.372
NECESSARILY NEED TO BE WORKING

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.873
WITH OTHER PARTNERS AND IN

01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.741
PARTICULAR THE FEDERAL

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.710
GOVERNMENT GIVEN THEIR LARGE

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.345
SHARE OF OWNERSHIP HERE.

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.846
TURNING TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.781
OUT JUST A VISUAL REPRESENTATION

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:08.283
OF THE BENEFITS OF HEALTHY

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.352
FORESTS AND THE POTENTIAL

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:11.519
CONSEQUENCES OF UNHEALTHY

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.488
FOREST'S --

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:16.157
WILD FIRES RESILIENCE CLIMATE

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.992
CHANGE AND THEN WATER SUPPLY

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:18.960
WHICH I'M --

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.028
I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.262
EVEN MORE IN THE THIRD PANEL

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.797
TODAY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT AS

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.366
THE LEGISLATURE HAS REALLY DIVED

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.534
INTO THIS ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:27.802
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:29.003
WELFARE AND WELFARE RISK BUT

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.605
PROBABLY NOT QUITE AS MUCH

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.107
DISCUSSION ABOUT --

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.309
THE WATER ASPECT OF OUR FORESTS

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.111
AND AND BENEFITS --

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.979
AND CONSEQUENCES OF AND HEALTHY

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:40.215
FORESTS SO I THINK AGAIN YOUR

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:41.750
THIRD PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT THAT

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:42.450
BUT THAT IS THE THEME OF SOME OF

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.953
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SO I WANTED

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.054
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:47.489
TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF THE

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:48.490
HAND OUT ANOTHER VISUAL

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:49.824
REPRESENTATION OF THE

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.726
CONSEQUENCES OF UNHEALTHY

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.661
FOREST'S THIS SUCH REPORTER

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.196
TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT THAT HERE

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:56.965
IT IS FOR YOU IN VISUAL FORM OF

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:58.633
THE TWENTY LARGEST AND TWENTY

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.601
MOST DESTRUCTIVE.

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:00.335
FIRES SINCE CALIFORNIA HAS

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:04.472
STARTED TRACK YOU CAN SEE THEY

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:05.774
HAVE BEEN VERY.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.776
NOTABLY CLUSTERED IN THE PAST

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:10.044
TWO DECADES AND THE TOP.

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.679
MOST DESTRUCTIVE WHEN WE

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:12.914
PUBLISHED OUR REPORT THEM

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.649
LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE HAD

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.484
JUST HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:17.018
SEVENTEEN EVEN SINCE WE'VE

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:17.886
PUBLISHED THOSE HAVE BEEN

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.521
SURPASSED BY THE TWO THOUSAND

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.923
EIGHTEEN FIRES.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.259
SO TURNING TO PAGE.

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:25.927
FOUR I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.295
HAD MORE RECOMMENDATIONS THAN

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.063
ARE SHOWN HERE IN OUR REPORT AND

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.165
SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE ALREADY

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.633
BEEN ADOPTED IN THE LAST

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:33.067
LEGISLATIVE SESSION --

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.436
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.804
HAD ABOUT FUNDING FOR PILOT

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.405
PROJECTS FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.574
WOODY BIOMASS AND MAKING SOME

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.942
CHANGES TO SOME OF CAL FIRES

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.710
PROGRAMS FOR LANDOWNERS TO MAKE

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:44.846
THEM EASIER --

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.181
TO TO UNDERTAKE SOME OF THEIR OF

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:48.650
FORCE PROJECT SO --

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.918
TO THIS IS A SCALED DOWN VERSION

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:50.885
WHICH IS GREAT.

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:53.221
I'LL TALK JUST PRIMARILY ON

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.923
THESE FIRST THREE BULLETS THAT

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.191
OUR OVER ARCHING AROUND

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:57.625
IMPROVING AND INCREASING FUNDING

01:24:57.692 --> 01:24:59.093
IN COORDINATION.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.562
THE FIRST ONE IS ALREADY BEEN

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:01.996
DISCUSSED HERE TODAY.

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.566
ABOUND THE REAL NECESSITY FOR

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.468
CLEAR PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.636
OVER HOW WE USE OUR FUNDING AND

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:11.539
HOW WE'RE TARGETING --

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:12.173
THERE'S SOME PROGRESS BEING MADE

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.411
ON THE HERE AT AB TWENTY FIVE

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:17.312
TWENTY ONE THAT IS DIRECTING THE

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:18.880
ADMINISTRATION TO PUT TOGETHER

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.381
PRIORITIZATION PLAN.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.583
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KEEP

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.651
TALKING ABOUT THIS CNH OVERSIGHT

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:24.786
HEARING IN EACH BUDGET

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.621
APPROPRIATION HOW ARE WE MAKING

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.089
SURE WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE USE OF

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.757
OUR FUNDING AND WHAT CRITERIA

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:32.894
ARE WE USING --

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.929
A THE FORMER EXECUTIVE OFFICER

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.898
OF YOUR NEVADA CONSERVANCY WOULD

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:37.732
TALK ABOUT LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:38.833
NOT --

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.502
UNDERTAKING RANDOM ACTS OF

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:41.736
RESTORATION WHICH I THOUGHT WAS

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:42.637
A GREAT.

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.572
WAY TO THINK ABOUT MAKING SURE

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.307
THAT WERE REALLY BUILDING ON THE

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.142
EFFORTS WERE DOING AND AND

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:49.010
ENTERING IN THERE A LOT OF

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:49.777
DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD BE

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:50.945
PRIORITIZE AND WE COULD

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.514
PRIORITISE KEY WATERSHEDS.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.449
WE GET PRIORITIZE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:58.119
WE GET PRIORITIZE GREENHOUSE GAS --

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:00.922
REDUCTION WE COULDN'T PRIORITIZE

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.357
WHERE WE HAVE PARTNERS IN PLACE

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.525
THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT --

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.193
AVENUES WE COULD USE BUT IF

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.394
WE'RE KIND OF STRIKING --

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.795
IN TRYING TO STRIKE EACH ONE WE

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:09.697
MAY LOSE THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.266
THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.669
MAXIMIZE GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.504
PROBLEM AND THE LIMITED FUNDS.

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.105
THE SECOND BULLET AT THIS WAS

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:17.772
ALSO TOUCHED ON ALREADY IN SOME

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:19.307
OF THE CONVERSATION WE

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.708
RECOMMENDED IN OUR REPORT

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.544
ELEVATING THIS ISSUE TO AN

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:25.046
AGENCY LEVEL AND HAVING A FOUR A

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.481
FOREST HEALTH TEAM.

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:28.249
OUT OF RESOURCES AGENCY THAT'S

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.218
IN CHARGE OF THESE PROACTIVE

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:31.886
FOREST HEALTH ACTIVITIES.

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.087
CERTAINLY COVER WOULD BE AN

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:34.522
INTEGRAL PART OF THAT BUT THERE

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.990
WERE TWO REASONS WE THOUGHT THAT

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:37.759
THIS MADE SENSE FIRST TO BREAK

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.427
DOWN SOME OF THE SILOS ACROSS

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.162
THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS --

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:42.196
ESPECIALLY WITH FISH AND

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.298
WILDLIFE AND WATER BOARD AND

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.999
OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:48.069
IN PERMITTING --

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:49.237
AND FOR AND ALLOCATING FUNDING

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:50.405
FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES TO

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.773
ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE MORE

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:53.541
STREAMLINED AND SEAMLESS BUT

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.610
ALSO SECONDLY GIVEN THE EXTENDED

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:56.911
WILDFIRE SEASON THAT WE'RE

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.447
SEEING.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:00.648
HOW FIRES UNDERSTANDABLY?

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:01.849
HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:02.951
ATTENTION SPECIALLY AT THE

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:04.485
LEADERSHIP LEVEL RESPONDING TO

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:05.553
THESE FIRES FOR LONGER PERIODS

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.121
OF TIME AND WE THOUGHT THAT

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.923
HOUSING IT AT THE AGENCY LEVEL

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.525
COULD KEEP THE FOCUS.

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:12.060
ON EVEN SOME OF THE

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.528
ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS LIKE

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:14.762
DEVELOPING GRANT CRITERION

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:16.497
MAKING SUR GRANTED GRANTS GET

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.865
OUT THE DOOR --

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.601
YOU WHEN CAL FIRE LEADERSHIP MAY

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:22.904
BE AGAIN UNDERSTANDABLY AND AND

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.539
JUSTIFIABLY FOCUSED ON FIGHTING

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.374
FIRES THAT WE DON'T LOSE THOSE

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.775
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:28.910
AND THEN THE THIRD BULLET THIS

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.111
IS AN AREA THAT HASN'T HAD AS

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.479
MUCH --

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.982
LEGISLATIVE FOCUS IN THE RECENT

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.283
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES IN RECENT

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.583
[inaudible]

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.752
MONTHS.

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:38.987
REALLY LOOKING AT WHO ARE IS

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:41.155
BENEFITING FROM OUR FOREST AND

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.991
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS --

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:44.792
CONTRIBUTING TO THE WORK THAT

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.060
NEEDS TO BE DONE AND

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:47.862
SPECIFICALLY ARE THERE WAYS THAT

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.064
DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS SHOULD BE --

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.499
GENERATING AND CONTRIBUTING

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:52.967
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TO SUPPORT

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.469
SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES TO KEEP

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.204
OUR FORESTS HEALTHY SO WE HAD

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.538
THREE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.107
HERE THE FIRST REQUIRING THE

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.708
STATE WATER PROJECT TO MAKE AN

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.176
ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.444
TO HELPING MAINTAIN THE HEALTH

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:06.547
OF THE FEATHER RIVER WATERSHED --

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:08.116
DEBTS OF THEY CONTRIBUTE ONE

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:09.617
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:10.952
ANNUALLY FOR THE STATE WATER

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.520
PROJECT WE THOUGHT.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:13.588
WE THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF MAY

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:14.922
PERHAPS TEN MILLION DOLLARS A

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.124
YEAR OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.692
LINES THAT WOULDN'T CAUSE ON DO

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:18.359
YOU.

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.428
FISCAL BURDEN ON REPAIRS BUT

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.697
ALSO WOULD HELP CONTRIBUTE TO

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:23.731
THE WATER SOURCE.

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:24.932
SECOND WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT MAKE

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.669
SENSE TO TRY IN ENCOURAGE WATER

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.604
AGENCIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:30.838
THEY'RE BENEFITING FROM THEIR

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:33.441
WATERSHEDS AND UNDERTAKE SOME.

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.909
IT COST AVOIDANCE FOR IN THE

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:35.810
CASE OF WATER --

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.345
WILDFIRES OR COST BENEFIT

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:39.147
STUDIES FOR HOW INVESTMENTS

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.848
MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HELP JUSTIFY

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:41.949
TO THE RATE PAYERS WHY THESE

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.251
TYPES OF INVESTMENTS MIGHT MAKE

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.252
SENSE.

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:45.453
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INSTANCES

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.088
OF AGENCIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.990
NOTABLY AT EASTBAY MUD IN THE

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:51.092
MCCALL MANY WATERSHED AND

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.794
PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY --

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.494
SO WE THOUGHT THE STATE

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.463
PROVIDING SOME MATCHING FUNDING

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.731
TO HELP INCENTIVIZE SOME OF THAT

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.566
ACT ACTIVITY BY LOCAL WATER

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.301
AGENCIES MIGHT --

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:03.337
MAKES SENSE TO HELP AGAIN --

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:03.971
DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE THAT THERE

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:06.441
WAS --

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:08.876
RECOMMENDATION ON A WATER GRANT

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.011
PROGRAM THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:11.312
WATER RESOURCES RUNS TYPICALLY

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:12.780
BOND FUNDED THIS IS SOMETHING

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:13.881
THAT PERHAPS COULD BE WORKED

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.116
INTO A FUTURE --

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.551
WATER BOND WHERE THEY ARE

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.653
INCENTIVE POINTS GIVEN TO

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.088
AGENCIES THAT ARE SUBMITTING

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.590
GRANT APPLICATIONS TO DO WORK --

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:23.858
IN THE UPPER WATERSHED REALLY

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.661
CAUSING FOLKS TO LOOK UP AND SEE

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:29.030
WHETHER WATER SOURCE COMES FROM.

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.498
PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT IS

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:31.999
JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE IT'S

PARTLY A BUDGET COMMITTEE.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:39.140
MEETING.

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:40.374
YOU CAN SEE.

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.909
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:44.479
PAST FEW YEARS PRIMARILY FROM

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:46.514
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS --

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.216
TO JEFF BUT ALSO SOME I'M

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.851
PROPOSITION.

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:50.451
SIXTY EIGHT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.119
SOME OF THESE --

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:53.020
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS FROM MY

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:55.189
COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE PANEL SO

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:56.691
REALLY JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:58.192
AND THEN FINALLY --

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.328
PAGES SIX AND SEVEN WE HIGHLIGHT

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.929
SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS THAT WE

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.798
THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:06.467
LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON NOT JUST

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:08.035
TODAY BUT IN THE COMING.

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:10.938
WEEKS MONTHS AND YEARS AND AND

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.373
YOU ALL ARE RIGHT IN IT THAT

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.674
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THESE

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.476
QUESTIONS ALREADY TODAY --

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:18.846
ARE WE HIT IT'S WHAT KIND OF

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.915
PROGRESS ARE WE MAKING ARE THERE

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.683
BARRIERS ARE CHALLENGES THAT YOU

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.318
ALL CAN HELP WITH THROUGH

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:26.354
ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION.

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.122
HOW ARE WE INSURING WHAT'S A

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.857
PRIORITIZATION THIS THEME HOW

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.292
ARE WE INSURING WHERE ACHIEVING

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.394
OUR BENEFITS --

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.897
WHAT PROACTIVE STEPS ARE

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:37.231
DEPARTMENTS TAKING AND

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.699
PARTICULAR CALVARY NOW SINCE

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:39.867
THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF MOST OF THE

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.302
MONEY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:43.171
HITTING ALL OF OUR TARGET AREAS

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:43.838
AS?

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.473
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS MENTION

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.507
NOT WE'RE NOT JUST GIVING THE

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.909
FUNDING TO THE BEST GRANT

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.043
WRITERS BUT WE'RE TARGETING

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.312
WHERE THE FUNDING IS REALLY --

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:52.847
IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE MOST --

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.215
TO CHECK IMPACT.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.250
I THINK THIS FINAL ROUND THE

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:57.652
BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX THIS SET OF

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.554
QUESTIONS AROUND LOCAL CAPACITY

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.855
IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.056
IMPORTANT TO REALLY KEEP AN EYE

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:04.192
ON DO WE HAVE ENOUGH FORESTERS

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:05.660
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO UNDERTAKE

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.628
THESE PROJECTS TO WE HAVE.

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.664
BEEN OF GREAT WRITERS AND LOCAL

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.899
PROJECTS SPONSORS OBSEQUIES

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:15.870
SPONSORS ARE THE TYPES OF OF

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:17.271
PROACTIVE WORK NEEDING TO BE

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.173
TAKEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.142
AREAS WE NEED THEM TO BE DONE

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.476
ARE THERE ADDITIONAL STEPS THE

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.945
STATE NEEDS TO TAKE TO BE SURE

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:24.679
THAT WERE --

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:27.415
UNDERTAKING THOSE PROJECTS IN

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.417
THE KEY AREAS.

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:31.118
PAGE SEVEN WHAT CREATURE WE

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:32.753
USING TO ALLOCATE FUNDING ACROSS

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.754
THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AS WAS

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:35.223
ALREADY ASK BETWEEN FOREST

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:36.457
HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION THAT

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:37.425
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:38.926
HAS LARGELY DELEGATED TO CAL

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.628
FIRE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:42.296
ACROSS THOSE TO PROGRAMS.

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:43.598
THAT MAY BE SOMETHING IN THE

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.032
FUTURE IF YOU'RE NOT.

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.000
COMFORTABLE WITH THE DECISIONS

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.201
YOU'RE MAKING THEY'RE MAKING YOU

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:48.402
MAY WANT TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.737
HELPING MAKE THOSE ALLOCATION

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:52.173
DISCUSSIONS DECISIONS AS WELL.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.274
AND THEN HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.809
WERE YIELDING SUCCESS WHAT KIND

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.644
OF METRICS THIS IS A TOUGH ONE

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:58.479
BECAUSE HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.514
AVOIDED A SEVERE WILD FIRE OR

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.183
NOT THESE THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.517
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BUT WE DON'T.

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:04.952
SPECIALLY WITH THE LEVEL

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:05.586
INVESTMENT THE STATE'S MAKING WE

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.655
DON'T I'VE SPENT A BILLION

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.156
DOLLARS AND WONDER WHAT WE GOT

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.024
FROM IT.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:13.094
SO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH THE

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.395
SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THIS KIND

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:15.897
OF RESEARCH AND THE DEPARTMENTS

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.265
THAT ARE RUNNING THESE PROGRAMS

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.066
ABOUT HOW ARE WE MEASURING

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.002
SUCCESS AND HOW ARE WE

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:22.803
IDENTIFYING THE AREAS THAT WE

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.672
THINK WE WILL.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.239
GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:26.340
BUCK.

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.742
SO REALLY ENCOURAGED TO SEE

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.243
THESE QUESTIONS ALREADY BEING A

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:30.978
FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.914
AND WE REALLY THINK KEEPING OUR

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.716
FOCUS ON THIS OVER THE COMING

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.418
MONTHS AND YEARS WILL HELP.

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:39.353
ENSURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.022
ARE A STRATEGIC AS WE CAN.

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.390
THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD OUR

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:43.591
QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.660
PANEL --

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.595
WITHOUT WILL.

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.462
GOOD MORNING CHAIR FRIEDMAN AND

AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.676
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY AND

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:03.678
HOW THE STATE'S NATURAL WORKING

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:05.313
LANCE FIT INTO THAT STRATEGY.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:06.414
SO YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.548
ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.417
IMPACTING OUR LANDS AND THE NEED

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:10.751
FOR US TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGING

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:11.986
CLIMATE.

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.387
CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:33:13.454 --> 01:33:14.855
THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT FROM

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.057
WORKING LANDS IN CLIMATE

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.758
MITIGATION SINCE OUR FIRST

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:19.860
CLIMATE CHANGE COPING PLAN IN

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:21.395
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT R.

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.630
NATURAL WORKING LANDS INCLUDING

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.231
FOREST'S FOR THE ONLY FACTOR

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:26.000
THAT CAN SEQUESTER CARBON THAT

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:27.802
IS THEY CAN PULL CARBON DIOXIDE.

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.503
OUT OF THE AIR FROM A CLIMATE

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.005
CHANGE MITIGATION PERSPECTIVE

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:34.709
THAT MAKES THE SECTOR UNIQUE.

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:35.876
I WILL CARB RECENTLY COMPLETED

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.411
THE FIRST NATIONAL WORKING LANDS

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:40.748
GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY.

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:43.117
LANDS EXPERIENCED A NET LOSS OF

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.318
OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:46.387
MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:49.090
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.491
TWENTY FOURTEEN MOST OF THAT IS

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:51.692
DUE TO WILD FIRE.

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:52.493
THAT TRANSLATES TO OVER SIX

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.262
HUNDRED AND ENDS OF CARBON

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:57.365
DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT OVER THAT

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.199
TIME.

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.867
NOW WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY WE

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:01.402
SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT FIRE IS AN

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.970
INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:04.939
ECOSYSTEMS IT BELONGS ON OUR

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.073
LANDSCAPES.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.241
BUT WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:08.976
NATURAL SYSTEMS IN WHICH FIRE IS

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:10.945
PART OF A REAL ZILLION SYSTEM

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:13.347
THAT SEQUESTERS MORE CARBON THAN

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:14.782
IT LOSES.

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:15.983
OUR MOST RECENT SCOPING PLAN WAS

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:19.286
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD IN LATE.

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.087
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS PLAN CALLS

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:23.858
THE LONG TERM GOAL OF

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.159
MAINTAINING OUR NATURAL AND

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:27.828
WORKING LANDS AS A CARBON SINK.

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:28.929
THE PROGRAMS THAT MANY OF MY

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.431
COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL TODAY

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:31.565
ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ARE AN

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:33.200
IMPORTANT PART OF RESTORING OUR

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.702
LANDS AND AVOIDING THE MOST

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.337
CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.172
CHANGE.

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.673
THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING LANCE

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:40.908
HAS ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.109
INTERNATIONALLY.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.244
LAST OCTOBER HE

THE TWENTY FORTY TO TWENTY FORTY

01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:53.587
FIVE TIME FRAME.

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.389
ACHIEVING CARBONNEUTRALITY IS

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:57.091
GOING TO REQUIRE DEEP EMISSION

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.192
CUTS.

01:34:58.259 --> 01:35:00.327
AS WELL AS INCREASED CARBON

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:01.762
STORAGE AND SEQUESTRATION.

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:02.763
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL GONNA

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:05.099
HAVE SOME COMBUSTION AND TWENTY

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.000
FORTY FIVE SO WE NEED TO HAVE

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:08.169
SOME SEQUESTRATION INCLUDING

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.770
SEQUESTRATION ON NATURAL WORKING

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.605
LANDS TO BALANCE OUT THOSE

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:12.740
EMISSIONS.

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.974

STARTED WE CAN --

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.781
HELP IN CERTAIN MORE FUNDING TO

01:40:53.847 --> 01:40:54.681
TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:55.315

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:56.984
PROJECT AND SKIP THE WHOLE

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:59.319
PROCESS OF OF RE VETTING AND

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:00.854
DOING DILIGENCE ON THAT PROJECT

AGREEMENT EXECUTIONER

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:06.760
CONTRACTING PROCESS --

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.262
WE ARE NOW ALSO PILOTING DIRECT

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:11.031
FUNDED AWARDS TO PARTNERS AND SO

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:11.932
THAT'S A REALLY EXCITING PART OF

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:14.301
OUR OF OUR PROGRAM IT'S STARTING

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:16.236
THIS YEAR.

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:16.904
DESPITE MAKING GAINS THE TIMING

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.305
IN TERMS OF MOVING FUNDING INTO

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:19.907
THE HANDS OF LAND MANAGERS AT

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:21.241
PROJECTS NOW ACTUALLY HAVE LESS

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:23.010
TIME TO COMPLETE THEIR ON THE

01:41:23.076 --> 01:41:24.211
GROUND PROJECTS.

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:25.479
BECAUSE EXPENDITURE LIQUIDATION

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.047
TIMELINES IN THE BUDGET HAVE

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:28.148
CHANGED FROM A TOTAL OF SIX

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.551
YEARS TO A TOTAL OF FOUR YEARS.

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.019
AND WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.220
THAT THIS FORCES PARTNERS TO

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:34.755
IMPLEMENT PROJECTS AND SOMEWHAT

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:36.623
UNFAVORABLE WAYS AND THEY WILL

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:38.258
SOMETIMES SPLIT PROJECTS INTO

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.893
PHASES SO THAT THEY ARE ONLY

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.328
ASKING FOR FUNDS THAT THEY KNOW

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:42.796
THEY CAN ACHIEVE.

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:44.665
IN A TWO OR THREE YEAR TIME LINE.

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:47.968
AND ONE PHASE OF THE PROJECT

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.536
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE BY

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:50.871
TIME THEY'RE DONE THEY DON'T

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.539
COME BACK FOR MORE FUNDING --

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:53.740
WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.375
CONTRACTORS ARE ASKING --

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.677
FOR OVER MARKET RATE FOR LABOR

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:58.278
BECAUSE THE TIMELINE IS SHORTER

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:59.880
AND SO --

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.048
THEY HAVE TO SOMETIMES FOREGO

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:03.217
OTHER JOBS OR JUST BECAUSE THEY

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:04.918
KNOW THAT THE DEMAND IS HIGH

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:06.286
THEY ALSO RAISE THEIR RATES.

01:42:06.353 --> 01:42:09.156
AND FINALLY SOME PROJECTS ARE

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:10.224
COMPLETING SMALLER PROJECTS

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.458
BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.593
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE TO DO

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:14.094
AND SO IF THERE'S ONLY TWO OR

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:15.062
THREE YEARS TO FINISH THE

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:16.063
PROJECT AND THEY SPEND HALF OF

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.563
THAT.

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:17.998
ON ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE THE

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:20.434
PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS IS

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:21.034
SIX SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN IT

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:22.736
WOULD BE.

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.639
AND THE THE PROGRAM WOULD

THE SECRET TO DO THE PLANNING TO

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:40.099
DO EVERYTHING ELSE.

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:41.834
IN THIS REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY

02:05:41.901 --> 02:05:42.668
TO BUILD --

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:43.903
LOCAL LABOR FORCES THAT CAN

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:45.504

OFTEN TO DO THIS WORK --

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.385
IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL.

02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:00.819
AND IT'S GOOD TO JUST BE KIND OF

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.488
HONEST ABOUT SUCCESS HERE IS

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:03.188
THAT.

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:05.324
YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE EMPOWERED

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:06.458

WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

02:11:58.744 --> 02:11:59.511

EXCELLENT --

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:04.116
I I MAY NOT BE THE BEST PERSON

02:12:04.182 --> 02:12:05.317
TO SPEAK ABOUT ALL OF THE

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:06.885
FEDERAL PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS IT

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:08.353
BECAUSE IT IT DIFFERS FROM

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.454
REGION TO REGION BUT JUST IN MY

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:12.557
OWN WORK SETTING UP THIS PROGRAM --

EXAMPLE IN THE NORTH --

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:23.435
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK UP IN

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.070
THE CLAIMS CASCADES IT'S KIND OF

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:26.672
A LINE PRIORITIES AND UP INTO

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:28.440
THE THAT THE TRIBUTARIES DOWN IN

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.975

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:30.876
COAST AREA.

02:12:30.942 --> 02:12:32.244
BUT EVEN DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:33.245
PART OF THE STATE THERE'S JUST A

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:35.247
REAL CONVERGENCE AND CONSENSUS

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:36.315
FORMING BETWEEN THAT THE

02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:37.449
MANAGERS OF THESE TYPES OF

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.623
I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT'S A

02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.224

THE COORDINATION AND THE

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:38.196
IMPORTANCE OF THAT BETWEEN

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.331
DIFFERENT ENTITIES NOT FEDERAL

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.499
GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE LOCAL

02:15:40.565 --> 02:15:41.766

IT'S IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BUT I

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:55.313
THINK THAT YOU KNOW --

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:56.781
AGENCIES LIKE OURS YOU KNOW

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:58.183
WE'VE GOT LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.118
AND LOCAL PARTNERS ARE CRITICAL

02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:01.253
TO WHAT WE DO WE ARE NOT

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:02.721
SUCCESSFUL IN ANYTHING THAT WE

02:16:02.787 --> 02:16:04.823
IMPLEMENT UNLESS WE'VE GOT INPUT

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.391
FROM OUR PARTNERS --

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:07.058
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY ON THE

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:08.260
SPOT -- IF

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:10.428
THERE'S ANYTHING LEGISLATORS

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:11.763
COULD DO TO IMPROVE THOUGHT --

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.899
OUR RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED ON I

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:17.335
THINK TRUST AND OF OUR

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:18.803
AVAILABILITY AND OUR DESIRE TO

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:20.705
SORT OF RAISE LOCAL ISSUES UP TO

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.641
STATE.

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:23.909
HERE'S IF YOU WILL --

02:16:23.975 --> 02:16:25.277
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE DIFFERENT

02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:27.312
THOUGHTS ON NOT BUT I FEEL LIKE

02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:28.547
IT'S A THING THAT THE ESSENCE HE

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.715
IS REALLY GOOD AT THAT WE

02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:32.350
SUCCEED I'D AND I CAN IMAGINE

02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:32.684
HOW YOU WOULD.

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:36.187
IMPROVE THE THERE MAY BE WAYS

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:38.023
I'M NOT THINKING OF I I WOULD

02:16:38.089 --> 02:16:40.358
JUST I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE

02:16:40.425 --> 02:16:42.227
YOU KNOW THE R. C. D. EXAMPLE

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:43.795
THAT KIND OF SHOWCASE HOW.

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:45.530
MANY OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:47.032
DOING AMAZING WORK WITH

02:16:47.098 --> 02:16:48.867
PRACTICALLY NO FUNDING.

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:50.769
AND IN A SPECIFICALLY WITH OUR

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:52.170
CD'S THEY ARE ONE OF OUR

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:53.838
STRONGEST PARTNERS ACROSS ALL OF

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.073
OUR WATER SAID WORK.

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:57.008
AND IN MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW NOT

02:16:57.075 --> 02:16:58.610
ALL OF THEM BECAUSE SOME OF THEM

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:00.312
DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING.

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:02.113
MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ANY --

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.782
TAX BASE TO WORK FROM AND

02:17:03.848 --> 02:17:05.083
THERE'S THERE'S SOLELY DEPENDENT

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:07.419
ON GRANTS IN THE THE SMALL BITS

02:17:07.485 --> 02:17:08.219
OF ADMIN THEY GET FROM THOSE

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:09.354
GRANTS -- TO

THIS IS THE GOAL OF OUR PROGRAM

02:17:13.725 --> 02:17:14.826
I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST THIS

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.494
IS JUST A ONE TIME PROGRAM YOU

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.096
KNOW FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:17:18.163 --> 02:17:19.197
STRATEGIC.

02:17:19.264 --> 02:17:20.632
LONG STANDING PARTNERS TO THE

02:17:20.699 --> 02:17:22.434
STATE THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME AND

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.702
STATES CAN ASSURANCES THAT THEY

02:17:23.768 --> 02:17:24.736
HAVE.

02:17:24.803 --> 02:17:28.006
THEY CAN BUILD A PROGRAM AROUND

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:29.307
THESE THESE CALLS OTHERWISE

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:30.208

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:00.338
IN YOUR C. D. REALLY PROVIDES A

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:02.741
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WORKING

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.275
WITH THE LOCAL LANDOWNERS.

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:06.077
IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE NEED

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:07.545
TO WORK AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING.

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:08.847
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY OWN

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:10.248
PROPERTY AND THAT THE AREA THEY

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:12.384
LIVE THERE SO THEY PROVIDE THAT

02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:15.320
NEXUS BETWEEN THE LOCAL THE

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:16.988
LOCAL THE LOCAL LANDOWNERS.

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:19.057
AND THE AND THE GOVERNMENT SO I

02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:21.259
THINK THEY'RE CRITICAL AND AND

LONGER TERM STEWARDSHIP

02:18:58.029 --> 02:18:59.531
AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW US

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.099
TO ACTUALLY GET --

02:19:01.166 --> 02:19:03.802
MORE OF THE BIOMASS THAT NEEDS

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:05.837
TO FOREST'S TO ON THE FACILITIES

02:19:05.904 --> 02:19:08.273
THAT NEED TO PROCESS IT --

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:09.774
BE THOSE BY AMOUNTS.

02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:12.510
OF ENERGY OR BIOMASS UTILIZATION

02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:14.045
OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO ZERO

02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:16.281
INITIATIVE AREAS ALSO LOOKING AT

02:19:16.347 --> 02:19:17.882
STREAMLINING --

02:19:17.949 --> 02:19:19.617
THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERMITTING

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:21.019
PROCESS SEES AND THOSE ARE

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:22.320
THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:23.421
OUT AS WELL --

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.790
AT SB NINE A ONE ADDRESSED SOME

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:28.927
OF THE BARRIERS LAST YEAR IN THE

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:31.796
SENSE OF LOOKING AT A SECRET

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:33.231
EXEMPTIONS AND THINGS THAT ALLOW

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.900
US TO GET WORK DONE MORE QUICKLY --

02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.535
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE INITIAL

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:39.938
ONES THAT I CAN THINK OF GREAT.

02:19:40.004 --> 02:19:40.238
AND THEN --

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:41.306
MISS CHANG I JUST A COUPLE

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:46.311
QUESTIONS FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL --

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:50.014
WE'VE BEEN INVESTING WHAT DO

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:52.083
BEST OPTION IS FOR MATERIAL

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.551
REMOVED FROM THE FAR AS FOR AIR

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:55.286
QUALITY AND GHG EMISSIONS I KNOW

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:56.621
THAT THAT'S A BIT OF A

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:58.089
CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT I'D LOVE

02:19:58.156 --> 02:19:59.023
TO HEAR.

02:19:59.090 --> 02:20:01.025
YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM --

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:03.495
FROM YOUR AGENCY SURE THAT IS SO

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:04.929
I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S ONE

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:07.132
BEST ANSWER TO THIS AND I THINK

02:20:07.198 --> 02:20:08.233
THAT --

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:10.001
ENCHILADAS MENTIONED --

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.736
IN HER REMARKS THAT THERE BE

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:13.772
HOSTED WITH UC BERKELEY A COUPLE

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.273
WEEKS AGO A BUYER WILL COME TO

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.208
ME FROM IT AT ON THE CAMPUS AT

02:20:17.275 --> 02:20:18.943
BERKELEY AND IT WAS REALLY

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.945
EXCITING TO LISTEN.

02:20:21.012 --> 02:20:23.214
TO THE POTENTIAL THAT WE HAVE TO

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:25.049
REALLY MOVE BEYOND THE KIND

02:20:25.116 --> 02:20:27.285
ABOUT BIO MASS PROJECT THAT WE

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:28.853
ALL THINK ABOUT SO WE THINK

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.623
ABOUT THESE DIRTY BIOMASS PLANTS.

02:20:31.689 --> 02:20:33.057
MANY OF WHICH ARE IN COMMUNITIES

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.159
OF THAT --

02:20:34.225 --> 02:20:35.660
REALLY CAN'T TAKE THAT POLLUTION

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:38.296
BURDEN AND AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:40.932
WE CAN MOVE BEYOND THAT INTO AN

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:42.133
ECONOMY WHERE WE HAVE.

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:42.834
BUT THAT THEY ARE CLEANER

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.502
BIOMASS PLANTS WHETHER WE ARE

02:20:44.569 --> 02:20:46.671
USING THIS WASTE PRODUCT TO MAKE

02:20:46.738 --> 02:20:48.006
TRANSPORTATION FUELS.

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:49.741
ON THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:50.842
THERE BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT

02:20:50.909 --> 02:20:51.943
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIGURE

02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:53.711
OUT HOW WE PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO

02:20:53.778 --> 02:20:55.413
DO THAT AND HOW WE AND SENSE

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.347
THOSE THINGS.

02:20:56.414 --> 02:20:57.248
AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE RIGHT

02:20:57.315 --> 02:21:00.585
NOW IS THERE ARE AND WE HAVE TO

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:03.354
FIND PLACES TO PUT THIS WASTE

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:06.024
RIGHT NOW AT THE PERFECT

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:07.192
SOLUTION THIS IS LOOKING AT THE

02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:08.626
SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED ON THE

02:21:08.693 --> 02:21:10.762
GROUND SORT OF IN THE REALITY

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:13.298
THAT WERE LIVING AND I'M.

02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:15.366
I I WAS ACTUALLY --

02:21:15.433 --> 02:21:17.335
AND ENCOURAGED BECAUSE OVER THE

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.803
LAST COUPLE DAYS I'VE HAD

02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:20.805
MEETINGS WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:21.873
GROUPS OF FOLKS THAT ARE LOOKING

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:24.309
AT HOW CAN WE TAKE FOREST WASTE

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:25.610
HOW CAN WE TAKE AGRICULTURAL

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:26.311
WASTE.

02:21:26.377 --> 02:21:27.512
AND MAKE PRODUCTS OUT OF IT THAT

02:21:27.579 --> 02:21:29.347
WE COULD SELL AND THIS IS KIND

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:32.283
OF A A WIN WIN WIN IT GIVES US

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:33.518
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WASTE

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:35.854
IT PROVIDES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.489
IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES --

02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:40.491
IT AND IT MERE DEPENDING ON HOW

02:21:40.558 --> 02:21:41.459
THE PROJECTS ARE DONE CAN HELP

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:43.161
US FROM A CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE SO

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.095
I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:45.897
OF WINDS THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:21:45.964 --> 02:21:48.032
LOOKING FOR IS WERE THINKING

02:21:48.099 --> 02:21:53.638
ABOUT THIS GOING FORWARD

EVERY YEAR OUT ON A REGULAR

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:14.092
BASIS WE CAN'T WAIT TO THE END

02:22:14.158 --> 02:22:16.060
OF FIVE YEARS AND SAY WE SPENT

02:22:16.127 --> 02:22:18.062

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:23.768
THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND

02:22:23.835 --> 02:22:25.003
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A

02:22:25.069 --> 02:22:27.105
GOAL FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:28.640

ANNUAL BASIS OTHERWISE AT THE

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:39.918
END OF FIVE YEARS IN THE BILLION

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:40.818
DOLLARS.

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:41.920
I DON'T WANT TO BE TALKING TO

02:22:41.986 --> 02:22:42.954
THE TAXPAYERS ABOUT THE FACT

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:44.856
THAT WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE SHOULD

02:22:44.923 --> 02:22:45.857
HAVE DONE.

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:48.626
I I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:50.795
LOTUS -- AT

02:22:50.862 --> 02:22:52.430
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENTS

02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:54.165
YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE SIXTY

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:56.668
PROJECTS.

02:22:56.734 --> 02:22:59.737
AND YOU MENTIONED IT TWO HUNDRED

02:22:59.804 --> 02:23:00.571
THOUSAND ACRES.

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:01.940

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:06.778
SPECIFICALLY I THINK I SAID OVER

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:09.180
SIXTY PROJECTS I LIKE TO HEDGE

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:11.115
IN THAT WAY OKAY --

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:13.351
AND AT THE HAVE BEEN AWARDED A

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:14.419
HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:17.322
TO CANCER THAT IS --

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:17.822
THREE THREE THREE BUDGET

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:21.059
ALLOCATIONS AND FISCAL YEAR

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:22.493
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ONE IN SIXTEEN

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.227
SEVENTEEN AND THEN --

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:25.263
THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:23:25.330 --> 02:23:26.831
ALLOCATION HAS ALSO BEEN AWARDED.

02:23:26.898 --> 02:23:28.967
I AM WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OF

02:23:29.033 --> 02:23:31.369
SELECTING PROJECTS FOR THE

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:32.503
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ALLOCATION OF

02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:34.872
A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION.

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:36.474
FOR THE FOREST HEALTH ARE ARE WE

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.910
SAYING IT'S AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:40.044
PROJECTS A YEAR.

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:41.079
AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:42.880
DIFFERENT THAN THAT IN THAT FOR

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.215
THE VERY FIRST YEAR IN FISCAL

02:23:44.282 --> 02:23:45.683
YEAR --

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:46.351
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN CAL FIRE

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:48.553
DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDING THROUGH

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:50.722
EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SO WITH

02:23:50.788 --> 02:23:51.823
THAT YOU'RE A BELIEVE WE

02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:52.957
ACTUALLY --

02:23:53.024 --> 02:23:56.394
AWARDED THIRTY FOUR PROJECTS AND

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:57.328
AND THEY WERE MUCH SMALLER.

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:59.897
AND MANY --

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:01.833
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:24:01.899 --> 02:24:04.168
AND THEN IN FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:04.836
SEVENTEEN ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS

02:24:04.902 --> 02:24:06.437
PROGRAMS GOT ROLLED UP INTO THE

02:24:06.504 --> 02:24:08.639
FOREST HEALTH OF PROGRAM OR MANY

02:24:08.706 --> 02:24:09.574
OF THEM DID.

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:11.075
AND THEN WE STARTED --

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:14.345
AWARDING MUCH LARGER AND ONE TO

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:15.480
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.781
THAT WERE REALLY LOOKING AT

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.616
INTEGRATING A NUMBER OF

02:24:18.683 --> 02:24:20.952
ACTIVITIES WHERE WE WE ASK

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:22.720
APPLICANTS TO BRING US PROJECTS

02:24:22.787 --> 02:24:24.222
THAT HAVE --

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:24.522
SEE -- YOU

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:27.158
KNOW USUALLY THREE OR MORE OF

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:28.626
THE ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES IN THE

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:29.861
THE PROJECT LINE UP SO THEY'RE

02:24:29.927 --> 02:24:31.763
DOING REFORESTATION AND FUEL

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:33.331
REDUCTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:35.033

ROLLS UP THE BENEFITS

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:44.535
COMMUNICATES THE BENEFITS.

02:30:44.602 --> 02:30:46.270
GIVES LEGISLATORS AND OTHER

02:30:46.337 --> 02:30:47.405
POLICY AND THIS IS A FUNDING

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:48.672
DECISION MAKERS --

02:30:48.739 --> 02:30:50.975
SOME EVIDENCE OF WHAT THE VALUE

02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:52.743
AND BENEFIT OF STATE INVESTMENT.

02:30:52.810 --> 02:30:55.079
IS AND HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:56.680
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL INVESTMENT.

02:30:56.747 --> 02:30:57.982
AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:30:58.048 --> 02:30:59.784
ONCE WE TESTED IT'S ONE OF THE

02:30:59.850 --> 02:31:01.118
INNOVATIONS WERE TESTING IN THE

02:31:01.185 --> 02:31:02.219
TAHOE CENTRAL SPHERE INITIATIVE

02:31:02.286 --> 02:31:03.921
AREA ONCE IT'S TESTED INVENTED

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:04.822
THERE.

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:06.891
ARE HOPE IS TO ROLL IT OUT

02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:07.758
ACROSS THIS YEAR AND ABOUT OUR

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:09.427
REGION RECOGNIZING THAT EACH

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:11.262
REGION IS DIFFERENT AND SO THE

02:31:11.328 --> 02:31:13.130
METRICS IN THE INDICATORS THAT.

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.498
INFORM --

02:31:14.565 --> 02:31:15.833
THAT DASHBOARD --

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.735
WOULD CHANGE AND SO CLEARLY

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:18.969
TRYING TO BASE ALL OF THOSE

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:20.905
THINGS THOSE ITEMS AND AND WHAT

02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:23.073
GOES INTO THAT ON ON SCIENCE.

02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:27.545
AND WE'LL OBSERVATION OF WHAT'S.

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:29.046
I WOULD JUST ADD TRADITIONALLY

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:31.115
THE WAY THE STATE HAS --

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:33.484
HAS HELD PROJECTS ACCOUNTABLE IS

02:31:33.551 --> 02:31:34.852
DID YOU TREAT THE NUMBER OF

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:35.686
ACRES THAT YOU SAID YOU WERE

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:37.087
GONNA TREAT AND THEN NOW WE'VE

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.689
BROUGHT IN --

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:40.691
YOU KNOW SOME MATH OF OF HAVE WE

02:31:40.758 --> 02:31:41.792
SEQUESTER THE AMOUNT OF CARBON

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.527
THAT BASED ON THE QUANTIFICATION

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:44.962
THAT THEIR BORDERS COME UP WITH

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:46.397
BUT IT'S BEEN PRETTY CONCRETE IN

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:47.331
THAT WAY.

02:31:47.398 --> 02:31:48.799
AND SO I THINK THIS TYPE OF WORK

02:31:48.866 --> 02:31:50.034
OF REALLY BRINGING IN SCIENCE

02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:51.502
AND GOING BEYOND THAT AND SAYING

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:53.270
HOW ARE WE MORE RESILIENT.

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:55.473
CAN WE MODEL THAT THE IF A

02:31:55.539 --> 02:31:57.007
WILDFIRE CAME THROUGH IT WOULD

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.742
BE LESS SEVERE CAN WE MODEL THAT

02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:00.978
THERE'S GREATER WATER SUPPLY

02:32:01.045 --> 02:32:02.913
THEM SNOW PACK BEING KEPT THERE

02:32:02.980 --> 02:32:04.949
OR YOU KNOW MEADOW SOAKING UP

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:05.983
THE WATER AND WHEN WATER COMING

02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:06.650
OUT.

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.118
THAT THESE ARE IT'S IT'S A

02:32:08.185 --> 02:32:09.753
LITTLE BIT MORE SQUISHY MEN DID

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:10.688
YOU TREAT THIS NUMBER OF ACRES

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:12.456
YES I DID BUT I THINK IF IT'S IF

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:14.225
IT'S BASED ON SCIENCE.

02:32:14.291 --> 02:32:15.259
THIS IS THE KIND OF WORK THAT

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:16.760
REALLY THE STATE SHOULD BE

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:18.696
PUSHING FOR AND LOOKING FOR IN

02:32:18.762 --> 02:32:20.764
ORDER TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:22.366
ARE GETTING THE TYPES OF

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:24.101
BENEFITS THAT WE WANT BEYOND

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:26.637
JUST.

02:32:26.704 --> 02:32:28.806
THE CONCRETE NUMBER OF ACRES.

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:30.007
THANK YOU FOR THAT I I DO HOPE

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.175
AS YOU'RE MOVING FOR THAT.

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:33.577
IT'S NOT JUST DID YOU DO WHICH

02:32:33.644 --> 02:32:34.411
SAID YOU'RE GONNA DO BUT IS.

02:32:34.478 --> 02:32:35.446
ARE YOU DOING WHAT WE NEED FOR

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:38.082
THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE ON AND SO

02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:39.450
I HOPE THAT THIS INNOVATION.

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.352
SOMETHING THAT CAN BECOME A

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:43.387
MODEL I'M QUICKER THAN.

02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:44.688
THE NOT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON

02:32:44.755 --> 02:32:46.056
WE'RE SURE FOR TIME --

02:32:46.123 --> 02:32:52.396
AND SO OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY.

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:53.731
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ON THE

02:32:53.797 --> 02:32:55.132
ROLE OF WATERSHED TH THAT WATER

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:55.766
SAID TO PLAY AS THE FOUNDATION

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:57.067
FOR A WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:58.602
HOW OUR INVESTMENTS IN FOREST

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:00.471
AND WATERSHED RESTORATION CAN

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:01.705
HELP IMPROVE.

02:33:01.772 --> 02:33:03.040
THE RELIABILITY OF OUR WATER

02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:04.441
SUPPLY.

02:33:04.508 --> 02:33:05.376
THIS IS QUESTION SEEMS

02:33:05.442 --> 02:33:06.944
PARTICULARLY TIMELY GIVEN THAT

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:08.112
THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:09.580
CONTINUES TO BE FOCUSED ON AN

02:33:09.647 --> 02:33:11.782
ILLEGAL AN ILL ADVISED EFFORT TO

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:13.150
RAISE SHASTA THEM.

02:33:13.217 --> 02:33:14.251
INUNDATING SACRED SITES AND

02:33:14.318 --> 02:33:17.888
MILES OF THE WILD AND SCENIC

02:33:17.955 --> 02:33:19.823
MACLEOD RIVER.

02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:20.691
WITH THIS TODAY WE HAVE LAURIE

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:22.960
WEBERN PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:24.962
OF THE PACIFIC FORCE TRUST.

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:27.431
AND M. VERSUS GUY WHO LEADS THE

02:33:27.498 --> 02:33:28.999
LAND WATER AND EAT YOUR PROGRAM

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:33.103
AT THE RESEARCH FOR THE FUTURE.

02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:34.972
AND MALCOLM NORTH PHD MR NOR

02:33:35.039 --> 02:33:35.806
DOES THE RESEARCH FOR IS THE

02:33:35.873 --> 02:33:37.374
COLLEGES WITH THE US FOREST

02:33:37.441 --> 02:33:39.076
SERVICE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST

02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:40.444
RESEARCH STATION.

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:42.313
AND FRET PROFESSOR EASY DAVIS I

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:46.417
AM THISIS POSSIBLE I DO

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:48.953
APOLOGIZE FOR THE TIME WE ARE

02:33:49.019 --> 02:33:50.220
RUNNING LATE AS YOU SEE WE'VE

02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:51.922
LOST MOST OF THE COMMITTEE --

02:33:51.989 --> 02:33:54.325
AND MULTIPLE TEARS UP ALONG THE

02:33:54.391 --> 02:33:55.859
WAY INSIDE APPRECIATE.

02:33:55.926 --> 02:33:57.261
YOUR YOU WORKING WITH US AND I

02:33:57.328 --> 02:33:59.463
DO APOLOGIZE AHEAD OF TIME FOR

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:00.064
GIVING YOU SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT

02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:01.565
OF TIME.

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:02.666
WE WILL DO OUR BEST AND THANK

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.034
YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THE

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:05.469
HEARING AND THANKS TO YOUR STAFF

02:34:05.536 --> 02:34:06.904
FOR HAVING PUT SUCH A GREAT

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:09.506
GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER --

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.709
MY NAME IS LAURIE WEBERN I AM

02:34:11.775 --> 02:34:14.011
PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER THE

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:15.179
PACIFIC FORCE TRUST.

02:34:15.245 --> 02:34:17.948
OUR ORGANIZATION IS.

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:19.316
COMMITTED TO CONSERVING FORCED

02:34:19.383 --> 02:34:21.585
RESOURCES FOR ALL THE BENEFITS

02:34:21.652 --> 02:34:23.020
THAT THEY PROVIDE.

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:24.088
OF THROUGH BUILDING A

02:34:24.154 --> 02:34:25.689
REGENERATIVE FOREST ECONOMY THAT

02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:28.258
SUSTAINS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET IN

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:30.227
THIS ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:34:30.294 --> 02:34:31.028
SO.

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:32.329
WE'VE SEEN TODAY FIRE IS A

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:35.833
DOMINANT FORCE IN OUR WATERSHEDS

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.201
EITHER FOR ILLNESS WE SAW SO

02:34:37.267 --> 02:34:39.136
MUCH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

02:34:39.203 --> 02:34:40.704
EIGHTEEN OR FOR GOOD AS WE ARE

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:42.506
INCREASINGLY SEEKING TO DO WITH

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:44.008
PRESCRIBED FIRE.

02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:46.677
OF FIRE FLOOD AND DROUGHT ARE

02:34:46.744 --> 02:34:47.845
DOMINANT FORCES IN OUR

02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:49.246
WATERSHEDS AND TODAY YOU MIGHT

02:34:49.313 --> 02:34:50.748
BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING THAT WE

02:34:50.814 --> 02:34:52.950
WERE BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:53.584
WITH THE PREACHER THE OROVILLE

02:34:53.651 --> 02:34:54.485
DAM.

02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:57.688
BUT HOW OUR WATERSHEDS FUNCTION.

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.657
IS HIGHLY DETERMINATIVE OF THE

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.825
AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WE HOUSE.

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:03.994
OF THE WATER THAT FLOWS INTO OUR

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:06.296
RESERVOIR IS HAT DETERMINES HOW

02:35:06.363 --> 02:35:09.833
MUCH WATER WE USE --

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.403
AND SO BY PUTTING OUR WATERSHED

02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:14.505
NOT ONLY --

02:35:14.571 --> 02:35:15.739
IMPROVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT AND

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:18.575
QUALITY AND TIMING OF OUR WATER

02:35:18.642 --> 02:35:19.843
BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE BENEFITS

02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:21.378
ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:23.681
MITIGATION ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE

02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:24.481
CHANGE.

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:27.051
UP FOR WHILE I FOR PEOPLE AND

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:28.419
FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES.

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:30.421
TOOK CALIFORNIA HAS PERHAPS THE

02:35:30.487 --> 02:35:32.156
MOST SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX

02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:33.757
PLUMBING SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.

02:35:33.824 --> 02:35:36.427
AND WE MOVE WATER AS YOU KNOW --

02:35:36.493 --> 02:35:37.428
SIX HUNDRED PLUS MILES FROM THE

02:35:37.494 --> 02:35:39.196
NORTH DOWN TO THE SOUTH ONE OF

02:35:39.263 --> 02:35:40.731
THE THINGS DR THORN WAS POINTING

02:35:40.798 --> 02:35:42.866
OUT EARLIER TODAY IS THAT SOME

02:35:42.933 --> 02:35:44.668
WATERSHEDS HAVE IMPACTS THAT ARE

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:47.037
NOT JUST LOCAL BUT THEY ARE

02:35:47.104 --> 02:35:47.971
RIPPLE ACROSS THE STATE.

02:35:48.038 --> 02:35:49.406
AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO LOOK AT

02:35:49.473 --> 02:35:51.108
IMPACTS NOT ONLY LOCALLY AS

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:52.109
YOU'RE POINTING OUT IN TERMS OF

02:35:52.176 --> 02:35:54.178
METRICS ON THE GROUND BUT HAVE

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.946
WE ACHIEVED WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:57.114
AND THIS NORTHERN REGION OF THE

02:35:57.181 --> 02:35:59.149
STATE BOTH OVER THE PAST HUNDRED

02:35:59.216 --> 02:36:00.250
YEARS AND PROJECTED GOING

02:36:00.317 --> 02:36:02.853
FORWARD REMAINS WETTER AND

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.454
COOLER THAN THE REST OF THE

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:04.288
STATE.

02:36:04.354 --> 02:36:06.657
AND INDEED WITH IN THAT AREA

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:08.192
THERE ARE FIVE KEY WATERSHEDS

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:09.093
THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE

02:36:09.159 --> 02:36:10.728
STATE WATER PROJECT AND THE

02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:12.229
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT.

02:36:12.296 --> 02:36:14.631
THOSE IVE KEY WATERSHEDS FILLED

02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:15.532
THE DEEPEST RESERVOIR IN THE

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:17.868
COUNTRY AND THE LARGEST

02:36:17.935 --> 02:36:18.802
RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTRY AND

02:36:18.869 --> 02:36:20.738
THEY THAT BEING THE SHASTA AND

02:36:20.804 --> 02:36:22.339
THE OR A BILL BUT THAT'S ALSO

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:23.907
THE SOURCE OF WATER FOR THE ST

02:36:23.974 --> 02:36:25.676
LOUIS RESERVOIR FOR THE LOS

02:36:25.743 --> 02:36:26.543
VAQUEROS.

02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:28.545
SO THIS AREA OF THE STATE IS

02:36:28.612 --> 02:36:31.615
WHAT IS CORE TO DRINKING WATER

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:32.850
FOR OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION

02:36:32.916 --> 02:36:34.284
CALIFORNIANS TO ALL OF OUR

02:36:34.351 --> 02:36:37.521
IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:39.823
FOR INDUSTRIAL USES.

02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:41.358
THAT'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:43.794
DEPENDENCE UPON JUST THOSE SEVEN

02:36:43.861 --> 02:36:46.196
MILLION ACRES --

02:36:46.263 --> 02:36:47.364
AS OUR PARTS POPULATION

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:48.532
CONTINUES TO GROW AND IS

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:50.267
CONCENTRATED IN URBAN AREAS THAT

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:52.102
RELIANCE WILL BE EVEN MORE SO

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:53.570
BECAUSE THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH

02:36:53.637 --> 02:36:55.172
PART OF THE STATE CONTINUES TO

02:36:55.239 --> 02:36:56.473
WARM AND DRY.

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:58.876
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND I

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:00.310
ALSO WANT TO MENTION THIS THIS

02:37:00.377 --> 02:37:02.346
PROVIDE 7% OF THE POWER FOR THE

02:37:02.412 --> 02:37:04.047
STATE THROUGH THE HYDROELECTRIC

02:37:04.114 --> 02:37:06.617
CAPACITY OF THESE PROJECTS.

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:08.418
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WE

02:37:08.485 --> 02:37:11.221
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT SUB OPTIMAL

02:37:11.288 --> 02:37:12.723
WATERSHED CONDITION THAT WE HAVE?

02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:14.258
THREATENS NOT ONLY ARE AIR

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:15.592
QUALITY THROUGH THE FIRES BUT

02:37:15.659 --> 02:37:17.561
OUR WATER SUPPLY AND THAT WE

02:37:17.628 --> 02:37:19.763
HAVE TO APPROACH IT AS A WHOLE

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.732
AND THAT'S COME THROUGH IN MANY

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:22.733
OF THE COMMENTS FROM THIS

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.802
MORNING --

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:27.004
EVEN SCALING UP.

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:28.872
WE ARE STILL WELL BELOW THE

02:37:28.939 --> 02:37:30.240
SCALE THAT WE NEED TO BE OUT

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:31.175
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEVEN MILLION

02:37:31.241 --> 02:37:32.910
ACRES.

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:35.145
AND COORDINATING INVESTMENTS AND

02:37:35.212 --> 02:37:36.847
ACTIVITIES ACROSS SO SEVEN

02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:39.082
MILLION ACRES REALLY REQUIRES A

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:40.884
DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.653
HOW WE APPROACH OUR WATERSHEDS.

02:37:42.719 --> 02:37:44.421
AND THAT WAY OF THINKING REALLY

02:37:44.488 --> 02:37:46.657
IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE COMMONLY

02:37:46.723 --> 02:37:48.425
USE IN INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING.

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:49.393
SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BUILD A

02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:50.727
DAM YOU DON'T SAY GEE I'M GOING

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:52.129
TO PUT DOWN A TON OF CONCRETE

02:37:52.196 --> 02:37:54.331
THIS HEARING FIVE YEARS ALL PUT

02:37:54.398 --> 02:37:56.066
DOWN ANOTHER TOWN A CONCRETE

02:37:56.133 --> 02:37:56.700
NUMBER MAYBE ALL ORDER THE REBAR

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:58.735
AND I SHOULD HAVE SOME PEOPLE

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.003
LINED UP FOR THIS.

02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:01.205
TO YOU WOULD SAY LET'S LOOK AT

02:38:01.271 --> 02:38:02.840
THIS AS A WHOLE TOP TO BOTTOM

02:38:02.906 --> 02:38:05.542
IDENTIFY OUR LABOR NEEDS ARE

02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:07.044
PROJECTS SPECIFICS.

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:08.579
AND WHAT'S THE FINANCING THAT WE

02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:11.448
HAVE TO HAVE A IT UP BECAUSE

02:38:11.515 --> 02:38:12.816
EVEN WITH A BILLION DOLLARS

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:14.518
ACROSS THE STATE IT'S VERY

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:15.586
LITTLE.

02:38:15.652 --> 02:38:17.020
WHAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT IS

02:38:17.087 --> 02:38:19.089
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WE DO IN

02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:20.791
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND WE

02:38:20.858 --> 02:38:21.859
NEVER PLAN CANNOT?

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:24.795
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF NEW.

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:26.263
TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:28.732
TOOLBOX NOW AB TWENTY FOUR

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:29.499
EIGHTY WHICH WAS MISTER BLOOMS

02:38:29.566 --> 02:38:30.901
BILL IN.

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:31.935
TWENTY SIXTEEN ACTUALLY CODIFIED

02:38:32.002 --> 02:38:33.670
THAT WATERSHED ARE PART OF THE

02:38:33.737 --> 02:38:35.439
WATER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

02:38:35.505 --> 02:38:36.340
THE STATE.

02:38:36.406 --> 02:38:39.309
AND ENABLED US TO BE THINKING UP

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:40.777
AND THAT WAY.

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.512
AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE OF LAST

02:38:42.579 --> 02:38:44.081
YEAR.

02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:47.050
PUT IN PLACE A CALL FOR PLANNING

02:38:47.117 --> 02:38:48.218
AT THAT LEVEL TO HAVE AN

02:38:48.285 --> 02:38:49.820
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO MOVE

02:38:49.887 --> 02:38:50.621
AHEAD.

02:38:50.687 --> 02:38:53.090
IN PARTICULAR IN THIS REGION.

02:38:53.156 --> 02:38:54.124
AND THEN THERE'S A NEW FEDERAL

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:55.525
TOOL THAT I WANT TO FLY BECAUSE

02:38:55.592 --> 02:38:56.994
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:57.995
AND THAT'S THE WATER

02:38:58.061 --> 02:39:00.530
INFRASTRUCTURE INNOVATION ACT.

02:39:00.597 --> 02:39:01.899
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:03.600
PROVIDING NEW FEDERAL GRANTS AND

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:06.203
FINANCING FOR WATERSHEDS ALONG

02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:07.638
WITH THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:09.106
FINANCING AND INNOVATION ACTOR

02:39:09.172 --> 02:39:10.073
WITH VIA.

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.508
THESE ARE KEY TOOLS THAT CAN

02:39:11.575 --> 02:39:13.710
SCALE UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:39:13.777 --> 02:39:15.612
THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO

02:39:15.679 --> 02:39:17.481
DO THIS.

02:39:17.547 --> 02:39:19.750
WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO TAKE OUR

02:39:19.816 --> 02:39:22.119
YOUNG HOMOGENEOUS FORESTS AND

02:39:22.185 --> 02:39:22.920
RETURN THEM TO OUR MORE

02:39:22.986 --> 02:39:24.554
RESILIENT STATE WHICH PRODUCES

02:39:24.621 --> 02:39:26.323
MORE WATER AS WELL THE STORES

02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:27.391
MORE CARBON.

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:29.526
DOING THIS CAN CAPTURE MORE THAN

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:30.994
70% OF THE SNOW THAT CURRENTLY

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:32.496
EVAPORATES ON THE TOP OF THESE

02:39:32.562 --> 02:39:33.964
FORESTS AS WELL AS CAPTURE MORE

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:35.966
WATER THROUGH HAVING THE KINDS

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:37.634
OF TURBULENCE THAT.

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:40.337
CATCHES CLOUDS AND MILKS THEM IN

02:39:40.404 --> 02:39:43.540
A WAY THAT CAN INCREASE WATER BY

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:45.075
10225% OF WHAT COMES IN WITHIN

02:39:45.142 --> 02:39:46.510
THOSE WATERSHEDS WITH

02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:47.444
SIGNIFICANT.

02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:49.413
IF WE RESTORE OUR STREAMS WE CAN

02:39:49.479 --> 02:39:51.148
HOLD THE WATER LONGER WE CAN

02:39:51.214 --> 02:39:52.649
TAKE THE SETTLEMENT OUT OF IT

02:39:52.716 --> 02:39:54.651
AND WE CAN RECHARGE GROUNDWATER

02:39:54.718 --> 02:39:55.652
WE CAN ALSO REDUCE FLOOD

02:39:55.719 --> 02:39:57.754
INTENSITY WHEN WE COMBINE THAT

02:39:57.821 --> 02:39:59.256
WITH RESTORING WET MEADOWS.

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:00.724
THIS CAN REDUCE THE FLOOD

02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:05.262
IMPACTS 12240%.

02:40:05.329 --> 02:40:06.363
SO YOU CAN THINK BACK ON THE OR

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:07.497
A VILLAIN GO GOSH IF WE'D HAVE

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.099
THAT IN PLACE AND WE HAD A MORE

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:11.034
NATURAL HYDROGRAPH WOULD WE HAVE

02:40:11.101 --> 02:40:14.037
HAD THAT DISASTER --

02:40:14.104 --> 02:40:16.039
THIS IS KEY HERE IN LIGHT OF THE

02:40:16.106 --> 02:40:18.275
CAMPFIRE AND THE RIM FIRE THE

02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:19.810
SLIDE THAT IS ON THE LEFT THAT

02:40:19.876 --> 02:40:21.845
IS THE AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT THE

02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:23.513
CAME DOWN FROM THE RED FIRE.

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.482
THE YEAR AFTER THAT CATASTROPHE

02:40:25.549 --> 02:40:27.751
OCCURRED.

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:28.785
WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP OUR

02:40:28.852 --> 02:40:30.520
WATERSHEDS WHOLE THINKING OF

02:40:30.587 --> 02:40:31.922
THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:33.256
FRAGMENTING THEM FURTHER NOT

02:40:33.323 --> 02:40:34.658
DEVELOPING IN PLACES THAT WE

02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:35.926
DON'T WANT TO DEVELOP.

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:38.695
AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE

02:40:38.762 --> 02:40:39.730
HOME THIS IS THE FEATHER RIVER.

02:40:39.796 --> 02:40:41.999
WATERSHED.

02:40:42.065 --> 02:40:43.767
THE LARGE AREA COME DOWN TO THAT

02:40:43.834 --> 02:40:45.035
LITTLE RESERVOIR.

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:46.937
HOW DOES ONE WORK WITHOUT?

02:40:47.004 --> 02:40:48.472
THE GREAT THING ABOUT TOOLS THAT

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.574
WE HAVE TODAY IN OUR MAPPING IS

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.209
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS FROM

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:54.211
SPACE AND ANALYZE THEM THIS IS A

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:56.680
PART OF ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE.

02:40:56.747 --> 02:40:58.081
OF THE SEVEN MILLION ACRES IT

02:40:58.148 --> 02:41:00.484
TELLS YOU WHERE DO WE NEED TO

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:01.885
WORK ON THESE STREAMS.

02:41:01.952 --> 02:41:03.520
AND THAT FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDES A

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:05.655
GOOD TOOL TO THEN BUILD UPON AND

02:41:05.722 --> 02:41:07.391
SAY ONE OF THE SPECIFICS OF A

02:41:07.457 --> 02:41:08.992
PROJECT ARE WE DELIVERING ON

02:41:09.059 --> 02:41:10.961
THAT PROJECT CAN WE TRACK THAT

02:41:11.028 --> 02:41:13.497
BACK ON THE GROUND AND SHOW THE

02:41:13.563 --> 02:41:16.366
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE --

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:18.535
AS WE'VE HEARD MANY TIMES TODAY

02:41:18.602 --> 02:41:20.137
MANAGING ACROSS THE CHECKERBOARD

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:21.371
OF OWNERSHIPS IN A COORDINATED

02:41:21.438 --> 02:41:23.673
FASHION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:25.142
OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S ON THE LEFT IS

02:41:25.208 --> 02:41:26.076
THE MAP.

02:41:26.143 --> 02:41:27.110
WHAT'S ON THE RIGHT IS THE

02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:29.112
ACTUAL LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN SEE

02:41:29.179 --> 02:41:30.047
THAT THE DIFFERENCES AND

02:41:30.113 --> 02:41:31.381
OWNERSHIP LEAD TO VASTLY

02:41:31.448 --> 02:41:33.183
DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES

02:41:33.250 --> 02:41:35.886
WHICH LEADS TO DIFFERENT WATER.

02:41:35.952 --> 02:41:37.287
AS WELL AS CLIMATE THE FIRE OUT

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:38.755
COMES.

02:41:38.822 --> 02:41:40.724
SO I WOULD BRING THIS DOWN TO A

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:44.127
SPECIFIC AND SHOW HOW ALL THESE

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:45.862
THINGS CAN COME TOGETHER. ONE OF

02:41:45.929 --> 02:41:47.397
THE EMPHASES THAT WE HAVEHERE

02:41:47.464 --> 02:41:49.332
IS WORKING WITH OUR NATURAL

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:50.634
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WATER

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.669
SECURITY OUTCOMES AND FOR

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.404
CLIMATE OUTCOMES.

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:56.473
OF THE NATURAL APPROACH TO

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:58.175
ENHANCING WATER SECURITY WE CAN

02:41:58.241 --> 02:41:59.676
LOOK AT WITHIN THE SHASTA A

02:41:59.743 --> 02:42:00.944
NUMBER OF YOU ARE PROBABLY

02:42:01.011 --> 02:42:02.879
FAMILIAR WITH THE TRUMP

02:42:02.946 --> 02:42:05.248
ADMINISTRATION'S MOVE AHEAD. TO

02:42:05.315 --> 02:42:06.783
RAISE THE SHASTA DAM.

02:42:06.850 --> 02:42:07.984
THEY HAVE USED TWENTY MILLION

02:42:08.051 --> 02:42:09.686
DOLLARS FROM THE NGUYEN ACT TO

02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:10.620
DO PLANNING ON THAT TO MOVE

02:42:10.687 --> 02:42:12.389
AHEAD.

02:42:12.456 --> 02:42:13.323
AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE LOWER

02:42:13.390 --> 02:42:15.325
LEFT THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:16.860
THIS IS WHAT IS PROJECTED TO

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:17.727
HAPPEN.

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:19.596
WHEN WE RAISE THE SHASTA DAM IF

02:42:19.663 --> 02:42:21.131
WE FOLLOW THAT IT'S OF COURSE

02:42:21.198 --> 02:42:23.100
ILLEGAL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW BUT

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:24.768
IT HAS BEEN MOVING AHEAD NONE

02:42:24.835 --> 02:42:26.002
THE LESS?

02:42:26.069 --> 02:42:28.071
THERE WILL BE ZERO INFLOW

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:30.507
INCREASE AND AS I SAID EARLIER

02:42:30.574 --> 02:42:32.375
WHAT FLOWS INTO OUR WATERSHEDS

02:42:32.442 --> 02:42:33.643
INTO IT FROM OUR WATERSHEDS INTO

02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:35.712
THE DANCE.

02:42:35.779 --> 02:42:36.379
IS THE ADDITIONAL WATER WE HAVE.

02:42:36.446 --> 02:42:38.615
THERE WILL BE NO MORE WATER.

02:42:38.682 --> 02:42:40.150
THERE WILL BE NO SPECIFIED FLOOD

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:42.219
PROTECTION WILL BE SEVENTY FIVE

02:42:42.285 --> 02:42:43.520
HUNDRED JOB YEARS.

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:44.488
THE IMPACTS ON FISH WILL BE

02:42:44.554 --> 02:42:45.755
NEGATIVE ACCORDING TO THE FISH

02:42:45.822 --> 02:42:47.023
AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.

02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:48.458
THE IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:49.559
WILL BE NEGATIVE IT WILL

02:42:49.626 --> 02:42:50.994
INCREASE EMISSIONS.

02:42:51.061 --> 02:42:53.830
IT WILL RARELY HAVE ANY INCREASE

02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:55.031
IN SUMMER COLD WATER WHICH IS

02:42:55.098 --> 02:42:56.566
THE WATER WE MOST NEED IT'S THE

02:42:56.633 --> 02:42:58.535
MOST EXPENSIVE FOR AGRICULTURE

02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:00.203
IT'S WHAT'S MOST NEEDED FOR FISH.

02:43:00.270 --> 02:43:01.538
AND THE INCREASE STORAGE IS

02:43:01.605 --> 02:43:02.873
POSSIBLE PERHAPS A THIRD OF THE

02:43:02.939 --> 02:43:05.442
TIME.

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:07.110
UNDER A NATURAL APPROACH THE

02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:08.512
INFLOW INCREASE WILL BE ON

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:10.080
AVERAGE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:11.114
THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

02:43:11.181 --> 02:43:12.983
EVERY YEAR.

02:43:13.049 --> 02:43:14.217
IT'LL VARY YEAR TO YEAR BUT

02:43:14.284 --> 02:43:16.286
THAT'S THE AVERAGE WE CAN REDUCE

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:19.222
FLOOD INTENSITY BY 12240%.

02:43:19.289 --> 02:43:20.957
THE FIRE BENEFITS WE WERE

02:43:21.024 --> 02:43:23.193
CALCULATING THESE PRIOR TO

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:24.127
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:25.762
ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE TO DATE.

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:27.364
BUT THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE

02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:29.266
WOULD SAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED

02:43:29.332 --> 02:43:31.234
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:33.637
WE HAVE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND

02:43:33.703 --> 02:43:34.404
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN JOB

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:36.439
YOU'RE INCREASES SIGNIFICANT IN

02:43:36.506 --> 02:43:38.041
TERMS OF THESE RURAL ECONOMIES

02:43:38.108 --> 02:43:39.643
AND THE CIRCULATION OF DOLLARS

02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:42.112
WITH IN WORLD ECONOMIES MANY OF

02:43:42.179 --> 02:43:43.813
THESE ACTUALLY FALL.

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.448
IN THE MOST DEPRESSED NOT ONLY

02:43:45.515 --> 02:43:49.286
IN THE STATE BUT IN THE COUNTRY.

02:43:49.352 --> 02:43:50.854
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR FISH A

02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:52.656
CLEAR EXTENSION OF COLD SUMMER

02:43:52.722 --> 02:43:54.224
WATER BY TWO TO THREE WEEKS AN

02:43:54.291 --> 02:43:58.061
INCREASE STORAGE IN TERMS OF THE

02:43:58.128 --> 02:44:00.730
TOTAL BENEFITS THAT ARE THERE.

02:44:00.797 --> 02:44:03.867
NOW WE KNOW THAT WORKING WITH.

02:44:03.934 --> 02:44:04.701
NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS.

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:07.804
CHEAPER --

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:08.638
THEN IN OUR TASK OF WILL BE

02:44:08.705 --> 02:44:10.006
DISCUSSING THIS FURTHER BUT I

02:44:10.073 --> 02:44:11.541
JUST WANT TO FLANK HERE WHEN WE

02:44:11.608 --> 02:44:13.076
LOOK AT THE COSTS.

02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:14.477
THIS IS FROM NEW YORK CITY IT'S

02:44:14.544 --> 02:44:16.513
A CLASSIC EXAMPLE LET'S LOOK AT

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:18.615
THE COST OF OR A BILL A BILLION

02:44:18.682 --> 02:44:20.317
DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY COST.

02:44:20.383 --> 02:44:22.919
IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE TWO POINT

02:44:22.986 --> 02:44:24.187
TWO FIVE TO TWO POINT SEVEN FIVE

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:25.055
BILLION DOLLARS IN REPAIR WHICH

02:44:25.121 --> 02:44:27.324
WE SPENT ONE POINT TWO FIVE

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:27.824
ALREADY.

02:44:27.891 --> 02:44:29.092
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF THE

02:44:29.159 --> 02:44:30.427
SHASTA REYES IT'S VERY

02:44:30.493 --> 02:44:31.861
CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED AT ONE

02:44:31.928 --> 02:44:33.296
POINT FIVE BILLION?

02:44:33.363 --> 02:44:36.600
IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

02:44:36.666 --> 02:44:37.133
THAT'S ALMOST FIVE BILLION

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.736
DOLLARS. FOUR FOUR BILLION

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:40.737
DOLLARS WE COULD RESTORE THE

02:44:40.804 --> 02:44:44.507
ENTIRE WATERSHED OF THIS AREA

02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:45.842
THIS ENTIRE SEVEN MILLION ACRES.

02:44:45.909 --> 02:44:47.410
NOW IN ADDITION.

02:44:47.477 --> 02:44:48.945
WE WOULD HAVE MORE WATER.

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:50.780
WE WOULD HAVE LESS COST IN TERMS

02:44:50.847 --> 02:44:52.882
OF FIRE FIGHTING WE WOULD NOT

02:44:52.949 --> 02:44:55.552
HAVE THE IMPACTS IN TERMS OF

02:44:55.619 --> 02:44:56.419
LOSS OF THAT YOU KNOW.

02:44:56.486 --> 02:44:57.988
I FIVE TRANSPORTATION AS

02:44:58.054 --> 02:44:59.889
HAPPENED WITH THE FIRES THIS

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:01.858
YEAR HERE FOR OF THE STATE'S

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:02.892
FIVE MEGA FIRES WERE IN THIS

02:45:02.959 --> 02:45:04.261
REGION THIS YEAR HALF A MILLION

02:45:04.327 --> 02:45:04.961
ACRES.

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:06.263
WE SPENT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE

02:45:06.329 --> 02:45:07.564
MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN THIS

02:45:07.631 --> 02:45:08.331
REGION.

02:45:08.398 --> 02:45:09.866
SO THE BENEFITS OF WORKING WITH

02:45:09.933 --> 02:45:12.235
NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE ARE

02:45:12.302 --> 02:45:14.704
MANIFEST WITH THIS.

02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:16.239
I'M I WOULD TAKE A MINUTE TO

02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:18.008
FOCUS IN ON WHAT RACHEL ELLIS

02:45:18.074 --> 02:45:20.010
WAS TALKING UP WHO'S CURRENTLY

02:45:20.076 --> 02:45:22.379
PAYING FOR THESE WATERSHEDS.

02:45:22.445 --> 02:45:23.013
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE IN THIS

02:45:23.079 --> 02:45:24.114
ROOM.

02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:26.583
TAXPAYERS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:28.118
WE DID THIS ANALYSIS SEWING ON

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:29.819
THE KINDS OF COSTS THAT ARE

02:45:29.886 --> 02:45:31.788
COVERED UNDER AB.

02:45:31.855 --> 02:45:32.589
TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THAT ARE

02:45:32.656 --> 02:45:34.090
DESIGNED TO RESTORE FUNCTION TO

02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:35.892
WATERSHEDS.

02:45:35.959 --> 02:45:37.961
AND SO WHAT WE CAN C. IS ALMOST

02:45:38.028 --> 02:45:38.495
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:45:38.561 --> 02:45:39.496
DOLLARS A YEAR AND AGAIN THIS

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:41.331
WAS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:42.832
TOOK AN AVERAGE OVER THE PAST

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:43.633
TWENTY YEARS ABOUT THOSE COSTS

02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:44.934
ARE THEY HAVE BEEN ESCALATING

02:45:45.001 --> 02:45:47.637
EVERY YEAR.

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:51.641
THE QUESTION IS WHO BENEFITS --

02:45:51.708 --> 02:45:53.443
WELL I THINK THAT ONE OF THE

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:54.978
PIECES HERE THAT IS MISSING AND

02:45:55.045 --> 02:45:56.646
RACHEL WAS REFERRING TO THIS.

02:45:56.713 --> 02:45:59.416
IS THAT THE TWO KEY BENEFACTORS.

02:45:59.482 --> 02:46:00.884
OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:02.185
AND THE STATE WATER PROJECT

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:02.786
WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR

02:46:02.852 --> 02:46:04.187
SYSTEM.

02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:05.055
OUR WATER CONTRACTORS AND

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:06.990
HYDROELECTRIC.

02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:08.725
DURING THE DROUGHT FOR FOUR

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:10.760
YEARS THE COSTS OF P. GINNY TO

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:12.929
REPAIRS ONE UP BY TWO POINT

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:14.331
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS.

02:46:14.397 --> 02:46:15.732
THE COST OF WATER IN AGRICULTURE

02:46:15.799 --> 02:46:18.068
WENT UP FROM A HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:46:18.134 --> 02:46:19.602
DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT TO ALMOST.

02:46:19.669 --> 02:46:21.071
A THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:46:21.137 --> 02:46:22.172
AN ACRE FOOT

02:46:22.238 --> 02:46:25.308
SO CLEARLY THOSE ENTITIES DO PAY

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:27.210
IN A TIME OF EMERGENCY.

02:46:27.277 --> 02:46:28.845
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS COULD WE

02:46:28.912 --> 02:46:31.214
PAY SIGNIFICANTLY LESS BUT IN A

02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:32.816
MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL WAY.

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:34.284
AND FINANCED AS WE FINANCE

02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:36.486
INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE INCLUDED

02:46:36.553 --> 02:46:37.420
THOSE BENEFICIARIES IN THIS

02:46:37.487 --> 02:46:39.389
PICTURE.

02:46:39.456 --> 02:46:40.623
AND FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S THE

02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:42.359
APPROACH THAT NGUYEN TAKES THE

02:46:42.425 --> 02:46:43.927
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:46:43.993 --> 02:46:46.896
INNOVATION ACT.

02:46:46.963 --> 02:46:48.365
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SHASTA

02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:49.833
THE WATER CONTRACTORS WILL BE

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:52.402
PAYING INTO THAT?

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:53.837
A SINGLE BENEFICIARIES THE MAIN

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:55.772
OUTCOME THEIR WORDS IF WE PUT

02:46:55.839 --> 02:46:57.507
THAT INTO THE WATERSHED WE WOULD

02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:59.809
ALL BE BENEFICIARIES.

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:01.144
SO IN SHORT WORKING WITH NATURAL

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:03.046
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A WIN WIN WIN

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:04.080
WIN WIN.

02:47:04.147 --> 02:47:05.415
OF WHETHER IT IS FOR THE

02:47:05.482 --> 02:47:06.583
WATERSHEDS THEMSELVES IN THOSE

02:47:06.649 --> 02:47:08.251
COMMUNITIES FOR THE RECIPIENTS

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:09.586
OF THE WATER IN THE BOTTOM PART

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:11.488
OF THE STATE AS A LOCAL SOURCE

02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:13.490
OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

02:47:13.556 --> 02:47:15.091
OR FOR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:17.127
THAT ARE A KEY PART OF THE

02:47:17.193 --> 02:47:18.828
HERITAGE OF THE STATE.

02:47:18.895 --> 02:47:20.063
OF THE OUTCOMES.

02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:22.232
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

02:47:22.298 --> 02:47:24.667
THE WATER SECURITY FOR THE STATE

02:47:24.734 --> 02:47:25.769
AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE CLIMATE

02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:27.237
RESILIENT.

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:28.438
WATER SUPPLY WRIT LARGE

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:28.738
[inaudible]

02:47:28.805 --> 02:47:37.914
THANK YOU.

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:39.416
BUT I'LL DIVE RIGHT IN AND THANK

02:47:39.482 --> 02:47:41.151
YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME.

02:47:41.217 --> 02:47:42.619
OF AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY

02:47:42.685 --> 02:47:43.653
INSTRUCTIVE TO COME TO

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:45.522
CALIFORNIA HERE WE HOW MUCH IS

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:46.856
GOING ON HERE IT'S ALWAYS AT THE

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:48.224
AMAZING --

02:47:48.291 --> 02:47:49.959
AND IT'S IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:52.529
TO MAY WHAT I WAS ASKED TO DO

02:47:52.595 --> 02:47:53.530
AND BY THE WAY MY MY NAME

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:54.731
SANDBAR TESCO I'M THE VICE

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:55.698
PRESIDENT FOR LAND WATER NATURE

02:47:55.765 --> 02:47:57.767
OF RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE

02:47:57.834 --> 02:47:59.235
WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS.

02:47:59.302 --> 02:48:01.037
THINK TANK IN WASHINGTON DC

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:05.742
THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE --

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:06.376
NINETEEN FIFTY TWO BUT I COME TO

02:48:06.443 --> 02:48:09.245
THAT THAT POSITION GROUND THAT

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:10.647
US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:11.981
MOST OF WHICH WAS FROM OF THE

02:48:12.048 --> 02:48:13.082
FOREST SERVICE --

02:48:13.149 --> 02:48:15.618
LAST WITH AS HEAD OF RESEARCH

02:48:15.685 --> 02:48:17.086
FOR THE FOR SERVICE AS WELL AS

02:48:17.153 --> 02:48:18.621
BEING VERY INVOLVED A LOT OF THE

02:48:18.688 --> 02:48:19.956
NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:21.858
ACTIVITIES SO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:22.992
OF BACKGROUND BEYOND THE

02:48:23.059 --> 02:48:25.528
ECONOMIC SPACE --

02:48:25.595 --> 02:48:27.864
SO THE REASON I WAS VERY EXCITED

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:28.932
TO TO COME HERE IS IS TAKING A

02:48:28.998 --> 02:48:31.267
STEP BACK AND LOOKING AT THE

02:48:31.334 --> 02:48:33.369
CONTEXT FOR THIS ISSUE OF

02:48:33.436 --> 02:48:34.971
NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND

02:48:35.038 --> 02:48:36.706
WATER AND FOREST MANAGEMENT.

02:48:36.773 --> 02:48:38.475
AND ACTUALLY LAND MANAGEMENT

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:40.443
LAND MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL.

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:42.479
AND PART OF WHAT --

02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:44.581
BRINGS ME TO THE TOPIC AREAS

02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:46.583
WHEN WE STARTED PURSUING A

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:48.751
SERIES OF ROUNDTABLES FOR LAND

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:49.953
WATER OUR LAND WATER NATURE

02:48:50.019 --> 02:48:52.055
PROGRAM AROUND WATER RESOURCES

02:48:52.121 --> 02:48:53.623
I'M NOT TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT

02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:55.391
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS.

02:48:55.458 --> 02:48:56.759
THAT WE COULD TAKE ON AS AN

02:48:56.826 --> 02:48:58.328
ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS THINK

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.396
TANK WE DID A SERIES OF REGIONAL

02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:01.898
ROUND TABLES AND CHICAGO SAN

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:04.200
FRANCISCO DENVER HOUSTON OF AN

02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:06.402
ENDING IN WASHINGTON DC.

02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:08.438
AND OF A VERY SHORT LIST OF

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:10.139
TOPICS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.608
PROBABLY IN THE TOP THREE WAS AS

02:49:11.674 --> 02:49:13.276
NOTION ACROSS ALL OF THOSE

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:14.611
LOCATIONS.

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:15.912
THAT SOURCE WATERSHED SOURCE

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:17.413
WATERSHED PROTECTION AN ACTIVE

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:19.115
MANAGEMENT WAS CRITICALLY

02:49:19.182 --> 02:49:20.016
IMPORTANT FOR THE WATER

02:49:20.083 --> 02:49:21.618
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNITED

02:49:21.684 --> 02:49:22.452
STATES.

02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:25.021
OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT 50% OF

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:26.823
WATER DOES COME OFF OF OUR

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:27.323
DRINKING WATER COMES OFF

02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:28.224
FOREST'S.

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.926
SO TO BE ABLE TO BE GOOD

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:31.394
STEWARDS OF THAT LAND TO BE

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:33.229
PROACTIVE IN MANAGING IT IS

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:34.998
CRITICAL NOT ONLY IN THE NEAR

02:49:35.064 --> 02:49:36.733
TERM NOT ONLY FOR PARTICULAR

02:49:36.799 --> 02:49:38.768
LOCATION BUT FOR THE NATION AS A

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:39.702
WHOLE.

02:49:39.769 --> 02:49:42.071
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT HAS LED US --

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:43.373
TO MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION OF

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.208
MY PARTICULAR INTEREST IS HOW DO

02:49:45.275 --> 02:49:49.312
WE WHAT ARE THOSE UNDERLYING

02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:52.048
PRINCIPLES I HAVE GOT EXCITED

02:49:52.115 --> 02:49:53.750
ABOUT THE TOPIC.

02:49:53.816 --> 02:49:55.485
AND I THINK PART OF IT IS THE

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:56.686
THE COST.

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.221
AND THE THE TRADE OFF IN COSTS

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:59.355
AND AND LAURIE CERTAIN IS

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:01.190
POINTED OUT SEVERAL EXAMPLES ON

02:50:01.257 --> 02:50:02.725
HER PRESENTATION.

02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:03.793
OF COURSE THE BIG ONE IS THE

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:05.862
NORDICS NEW YORK CITY WATERSHED

02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:07.597
AND CATSKILLS MANAGEMENT AND A

02:50:07.664 --> 02:50:09.899
CLEAR BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:12.135
AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ONE POINT

02:50:12.201 --> 02:50:13.536
SEVEN BILLION ORIGINALLY.

02:50:13.603 --> 02:50:15.672
VERSES THE TEN BILLION TO

02:50:15.738 --> 02:50:19.142
ACTUALLY DO THE WATER FILTRATION.

02:50:19.208 --> 02:50:20.577
SO MANAGEMENT ECOSYSTEM ONE

02:50:20.643 --> 02:50:22.345
POINT SEVEN BILLION BRING WATER

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:24.314
FILTRATION SYSTEM REPLACE A TEN

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:26.916
BILLION TO CONSTRUCT A HUNDRED

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.551
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

02:50:28.618 --> 02:50:30.420
OBVIOUSLY A VERY GOOD COST

02:50:30.486 --> 02:50:31.788
BENEFIT RATIO AND THAT BUT

02:50:31.854 --> 02:50:34.223
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF A

02:50:34.290 --> 02:50:36.626
SERIES OF NOW DEVELOPING EGGS OF

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:38.394
EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE

02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:39.896
WORLD FOR HOW VALUABLE.

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:42.565
THAT NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:44.334
FOR DOWNSTREAM WATER SUPPLY.

02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:46.035
IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT QUANTITY

02:50:46.102 --> 02:50:47.570
IT'S ALSO ABOUT QUALITY AND I

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:49.105
THINK WE HAVE INCREASING

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:51.107
EXAMPLES WHERE THE THE QUALITY

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:52.942
OF THE WATER THAT COMES OUT OF

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:53.977
THESE SYSTEMS.

02:50:54.043 --> 02:50:55.878
REQUIRES LESS FILTRATION LESS

02:50:55.945 --> 02:50:57.981
TREATMENT THAT HAS DOWNSTREAM

02:50:58.047 --> 02:51:00.116
COSTS ALSO BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS US

02:51:00.183 --> 02:51:01.451
TO START THINKING ABOUT WATER IS

02:51:01.517 --> 02:51:02.785
A WHOLE IT'S NOT JUST THE

02:51:02.852 --> 02:51:04.120
DRINKING WATER BUT IT'S ALSO

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:06.356
INTEGRATING WASTEWATER STORM

02:51:06.422 --> 02:51:07.590
WATER IN A MUCH MORE.

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:10.760
OF AN INTEGRATED MANNER THAT

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:13.796
INCLUDE STREAM.

02:51:13.863 --> 02:51:15.298
BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:17.834
HAVE IS THAT WHO PAYS FOR THIS --

02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:20.203
AND THE THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE

02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:21.571
ABOUT NEW YORK CITY IS ALSO

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:22.772
PLAYED OUT.

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:24.674
IN PORTLAND --

02:51:24.741 --> 02:51:25.308
ACTUALLY PORTLAND IN NEW YORK

02:51:25.375 --> 02:51:28.177
OUR TO ONLY FIVE LARGE CITIES IN

02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:29.512
UNITED STATES THAT HAVE ON

02:51:29.579 --> 02:51:32.815
FILTERED DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES.

02:51:32.882 --> 02:51:34.484
TO THEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:36.853
MANAGING THAT UP WATERSHED THEN

02:51:36.919 --> 02:51:38.454
THE COSTS CLEARLY WORK OUT.

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:40.023
BUT IT DOES TAKE SUSTAINED

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:41.391
ENGAGEMENT TO TAKE SUSTAIN

02:51:41.457 --> 02:51:42.291
MANAGEMENT.

02:51:42.358 --> 02:51:44.227
AND THE PORTLAND EXAMPLE WHERE

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:46.362
THEY ACTUALLY PUT THEIR WATERS

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.863
BUT THERE WATERSHED IN

02:51:46.929 --> 02:51:47.930
PROTECTION.

02:51:47.997 --> 02:51:49.065
DOUBLE ONE WATERSHED IS THE

02:51:49.132 --> 02:51:50.833
PRINCIPAL SOURCE FOR THE THE

02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:52.468
WATER IT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE

02:51:52.535 --> 02:51:53.803
MOUNT HOOD NATIONAL FOREST.

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:55.371
AND THEY PUT THAT IN IN PLACE IN

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:57.073
THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:59.075
OF IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE

02:51:59.142 --> 02:52:00.576
AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN

02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:03.479
UNDISTURBED VERY LARGE WATERSHED

02:52:03.546 --> 02:52:05.581
SYSTEM TO BOOT TO BE OPERATING

02:52:05.648 --> 02:52:06.349
WITH HIM.

02:52:06.416 --> 02:52:08.184
HOWEVER MORE RECENTLY THEY'RE

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:09.419
FINDING THAT THEY'RE HAVING

02:52:09.485 --> 02:52:10.820
CRYPTOSPORIDIUM WHICH IS A

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:15.792
FACTORY OF A PROBLEM DOWNSTREAM.

02:52:15.858 --> 02:52:16.626
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:18.127
WILDLIFE COMING AND PART MOSTLY

02:52:18.194 --> 02:52:19.362
BEAR HAVE BECOME HAVE TAKEN OVER

02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:20.430
THAT LANDSCAPE.

02:52:20.496 --> 02:52:21.964
SO NOW THEY'RE ACTIVELY MANAGING

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:23.099
TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO THEY

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:25.835
ADDRESS THE WILDLIFE LINKAGES

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:27.136
THAT OCCUR WHICH HAVE OTHER THAT

02:52:27.203 --> 02:52:28.237
BENEFITS.

02:52:28.304 --> 02:52:29.505
AND ASIDE MOLD REALLY THIS IDEA

02:52:29.572 --> 02:52:33.943
OF CREATE MANY MULTIPLE BENEFITS

02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:35.645
BUT THE THE ACTUAL COST OF

02:52:35.712 --> 02:52:37.346
PUTTING IN A FILTRATION SYSTEM

02:52:37.413 --> 02:52:38.514
FOR THOSE THAT.

02:52:38.581 --> 02:52:40.450
CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IS STILL FAR

02:52:40.516 --> 02:52:41.884
LESS THAN WHAT IT WOULD HAVE

02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:43.453
TAKEN TO BE PUTTING IN A MAJOR

02:52:43.519 --> 02:52:45.121
FILTRATION SYSTEM.

02:52:45.188 --> 02:52:46.489
AND RUNNING IT ON AN ANNUAL

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:48.057
BASIS IN THE OPERATIONS

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.592
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:52.161
DENVER IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE MORE

02:52:52.228 --> 02:52:53.496
DEAR TO MY HEART.

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:54.931
BECAUSE I WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE

02:52:54.997 --> 02:52:56.532
FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THE

02:52:56.599 --> 02:52:57.266
TIME.

02:52:57.333 --> 02:52:58.968
WHEN THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FIRE

02:52:59.035 --> 02:53:01.104
IN THE THE IMMEDIATE WATERSHED

02:53:01.170 --> 02:53:02.705
ON NATIONAL FORESTS?

02:53:02.772 --> 02:53:05.408
THAT BASICALLY ELIMINATED TREE

02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:07.276
COVER RESULTED IN THE MAJOR

02:53:07.343 --> 02:53:09.011
SETTLEMENT LOADING ON THE DENVER

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:11.748
RESERVOIR AND THEY LOST PROBABLY

02:53:11.814 --> 02:53:12.548
TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OF LIFE

02:53:12.615 --> 02:53:14.217
OF THE RESERVOIR AND THE WATER

02:53:14.283 --> 02:53:17.019
SUPPLY BECAUSE OF THE THE

02:53:17.086 --> 02:53:17.920
SETTLEMENT LOADING.

02:53:17.987 --> 02:53:19.455
THAT RESULTED IN A PARTNERSHIP

02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:20.890
WITH THE NATIONAL FORESTS WITH

02:53:20.957 --> 02:53:22.959
MANY OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES

02:53:23.025 --> 02:53:25.094
WITH OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS TO

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:27.363
REDUCE THE SEDIMENT LOAD BY.

02:53:27.430 --> 02:53:28.831
ACTIVELY RESTORING THE FAR SO

02:53:28.898 --> 02:53:31.334
HAVE SOME VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:33.202
HOW THAT FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAYS

02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.970
OUT.

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:35.271
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:36.806
AND THIS IS PART OF OUR AND SON

02:53:36.873 --> 02:53:39.375
OF STRUCTURE ON HOW DO YOU GET

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:41.911
THE DOWNSTREAM BENEFICIARIES OF

02:53:41.978 --> 02:53:44.280
THAT WATER SUPPLY. TO HELP PAY

02:53:44.347 --> 02:53:46.516
UP WHERE THE STEWARDS ARE DOING

02:53:46.582 --> 02:53:48.217
THE WORK AND THAT'S THAT IS

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:50.153
PROBABLY THE ONE LESSON TO TAKE

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:52.555
COME FROM MANY THE OF EXAMPLES.

02:53:52.622 --> 02:53:54.323
THAT BY THE THREE EXAMPLES I'VE

02:53:54.390 --> 02:53:55.758
TALKED ABOUT NEW YORK DENVER IN

02:53:55.825 --> 02:53:58.561
PORTLAND IS THAT IT DOES TAKE AN

02:53:58.628 --> 02:53:59.629
ACTIVE --

02:53:59.695 --> 02:54:02.765
LEGISLATURE REGULATION OF ITS

02:54:02.832 --> 02:54:04.667
CAPITALS VOLUNTARY AND HOW DO

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:05.568
YOU THAN WORK THROUGH IT AND

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:07.904
SOME OF STRUCTURE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:09.338
CREATE THAT LINKAGE.

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:11.641
AND PART OF IT FROM AN ECONOMIC

02:54:11.707 --> 02:54:15.511
SPUR OF WHAT THAT WATER IS AND

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:17.113
AND WE HAVE VERY BAD REALLY

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:18.347
UNDERVALUED.

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:20.082
ACCESS TO WATER AND THE FLOW OF

02:54:20.149 --> 02:54:22.752
WATER ON OVER AND NOT JUST.

02:54:22.819 --> 02:54:24.120
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT OVERALL

02:54:24.187 --> 02:54:25.688
GLOBALLY IT'S IT'S A IT'S

02:54:25.755 --> 02:54:27.757
CONSIDERED A SOMETHING THAT WE

02:54:27.824 --> 02:54:29.792
EXPECT TO GET BUT WE DON'T

02:54:29.859 --> 02:54:31.727
NECESSARILY COSTED OUT. TO JUST

02:54:31.794 --> 02:54:33.896
A FEW LAST MINUTE POINTS TO

02:54:33.963 --> 02:54:36.666
REYES AND A FEW LAST THINGS AND

02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:38.334
AND I I ALSO HAVE TO COMMAND THE

02:54:38.401 --> 02:54:40.303
THE WHOLE MOVEMENT TOWARDS MORE

02:54:40.369 --> 02:54:42.071
INTEGRATED WATERSHED BASED

02:54:42.138 --> 02:54:43.840
APPROACHES AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:45.641
SO THE EXAMPLE WE HEARD EARLIER

02:54:45.708 --> 02:54:46.976
ABOUT THE SIERRA NEVADA.

02:54:47.043 --> 02:54:48.644
WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:51.013
REALLY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF MOVING

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.415
FROM A PROJECT SPECIFIC.

02:54:52.481 --> 02:54:54.483
LOCAL A COMMUNITY SPECIFIC TO

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:56.185
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE AT

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:57.954
A MUCH LARGER SCALE AND ALLOW

02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.622
THOSE TRADE OFFS --

02:54:59.689 --> 02:55:01.023
I THINK ONE OF THE THERE WAS A

02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:03.025
QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT THE ROLE

02:55:03.092 --> 02:55:04.227
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

02:55:04.293 --> 02:55:05.261
OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE FOREST

02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:06.596
SERVICE IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:08.197
ARE REALLY VALUABLE.

02:55:08.264 --> 02:55:09.765
PUBLIC LAND THE FEDERAL LAND

02:55:09.832 --> 02:55:11.167
MANAGERS WITH THE LOCAL

02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:12.735
COMMUNITIES.

02:55:12.802 --> 02:55:14.537
I COMMEND THE RISK RECENT FOREST

02:55:14.604 --> 02:55:17.173
SERVICE STRATEGY ON TOWARDS US

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:18.040
CHAIRED STEWARDSHIP THAT IS

02:55:18.107 --> 02:55:20.009
EXPLICITLY TALKING ABOUT THE

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:21.444
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FEDERAL

02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:22.879
STATE TRIBAL AND LOCAL

02:55:22.945 --> 02:55:24.747
COMMUNITIES. TO TAKE AN

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:26.115
INTEGRATED APPROACH.

02:55:26.182 --> 02:55:28.451
BEING ABLE TO USE THAT AS A WAY

02:55:28.517 --> 02:55:32.121
TO CHECK END OF ACTIVITY WHERE

02:55:32.188 --> 02:55:33.256
NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:55:33.322 --> 02:55:35.057
PROVIDING FUNDS TO THE STATES TO

02:55:35.124 --> 02:55:37.026
DO COOPERATIVE FEELS MANAGEMENT

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.728
PROJECTS. TO ME THAT IS A PART

02:55:38.794 --> 02:55:40.329
OF THOSE GOOD NEIGHBOR IDEA THAT

02:55:40.396 --> 02:55:41.797
HAS BEEN FLOATED.

02:55:41.864 --> 02:55:43.332
BUT I STILL THINK WE HAVE THAT

02:55:43.399 --> 02:55:44.867
PARTNERSHIP IS A GREAT EXAMPLE

02:55:44.934 --> 02:55:47.069
BUT IT STILL REQUIRES RESOURCES

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:48.704
AND REQUIRES A STANDARDS. TO BE

02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:50.239
ABLE TO DO THAT TAKE THOSE

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:52.375
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT TO TAKE THAT

02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:53.943
THE GOAL OF BEING ABLE.

02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:55.578
TO WORK AT THE WATERSHED SCALE

02:55:55.645 --> 02:55:57.446
WITH MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES TO BE

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:59.248
ABLE TO PUT INTO PLACE AND TO

02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:00.583
PUT IT INTO PLACE OF PRIORITY

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:02.351
WATERSHEDS AND WE HEARD A LITTLE

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:03.386
BIT ABOUT THAT.

02:56:03.452 --> 02:56:04.587
TODAY BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO

02:56:04.654 --> 02:56:05.521
GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:07.390
BUCK WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET.

02:56:07.456 --> 02:56:09.492
THE DANVERS AND THE SUCCESSES OF

02:56:09.558 --> 02:56:11.560
THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES WHERE

02:56:11.627 --> 02:56:13.129
YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A

02:56:13.195 --> 02:56:15.731
AND A VERY POSITIVE AND

02:56:15.798 --> 02:56:17.233
SIGNIFICANT WAY.

02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:19.168
A LOT OF GOOD WORK AND I I THINK

02:56:19.235 --> 02:56:20.770
THERE'S THERE ACTUALLY I

02:56:20.836 --> 02:56:23.172
PROVIDED A THE STATEMENTS THAT

02:56:23.239 --> 02:56:24.473
HAS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL AND AT

02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:25.608
THE WHAT I JUST WENT THROUGH BUT

02:56:25.675 --> 02:56:27.009
I AGAIN I APPRECIATE.

02:56:27.076 --> 02:56:28.511
BEING ABLE TO BE HERE AND THAT

02:56:28.577 --> 02:56:29.979
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:31.414
OPPORTUNITY TO FILL IN SOME

02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:36.118
IDEAS OF THAT I THINK ARE GOING

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:36.686
TO BE ECHOED BY MALCOLM OVER

02:56:36.752 --> 02:56:40.022
THERE.

02:56:40.089 --> 02:56:40.656
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:56:40.723 --> 02:56:41.357
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE --

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:43.159
I GUESS I'M PROBABLY GOING LAST

02:56:43.225 --> 02:56:45.361
BECAUSE I'M OF FORCED ECOLOGISTS

02:56:45.428 --> 02:56:47.330
IS BEEN STUDYING THESE SYSTEMS

02:56:47.396 --> 02:56:48.731
FOR A ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:51.334
NOW AND I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:52.234
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF

02:56:52.301 --> 02:56:55.905
WHAT MAKES THE FOR IT WORKS --

02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.406
AND HOW WE WOULD STORE MORE

02:56:57.473 --> 02:56:59.175
CARBON IN IT AND WHAT THE

02:56:59.241 --> 02:57:01.877
ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS WOULD BE OF

02:57:01.944 --> 02:57:02.578
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN THE

02:57:02.645 --> 02:57:03.646
FOREST.

02:57:03.713 --> 02:57:04.880
AND I'M GONNA CUT RIGHT TO THE

02:57:04.947 --> 02:57:06.916
QUICK WHICH IS BASICALLY ALMOST

02:57:06.983 --> 02:57:08.818
ALL OF MY RESEARCH AND EVERYONE

02:57:08.884 --> 02:57:10.419
I WORK WITH HIS WORKED ON THIS.

02:57:10.486 --> 02:57:11.454
HAS SHOWN THAT.

02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.556
YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE ALL

02:57:13.622 --> 02:57:15.725
THREE OF THOSE BENEFITS IN TERMS

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:17.493
OF IMPROVING WATER QUALITY AND

02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:19.462
QUANTITY IMPROVING CARBON

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:20.663
STORAGE.

02:57:20.730 --> 02:57:22.298
IMPROVING THE ABILITY OF FOREST

02:57:22.365 --> 02:57:24.100
TO BE RESILIENT TO DROUGHT AND

02:57:24.166 --> 02:57:25.901
ALSO TO BE RESILIENT TO WILD

02:57:25.968 --> 02:57:26.736
FIRE.

02:57:26.802 --> 02:57:28.270
BY RETURNING THE KIND OF

02:57:28.337 --> 02:57:30.740
STRUCTURE AND THE CONDITIONS IN

02:57:30.806 --> 02:57:32.641
THE FOREST THAT WE KNOW --

02:57:32.708 --> 02:57:34.176
THAT WE'VE WORKED ON TO BE ABLE

02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:36.078
TO UNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST FIVE

02:57:36.145 --> 02:57:37.913
OR TEN YEARS AND SO I THINK IN

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:39.215
THIS CASE IT REALLY IS A WIN

02:57:39.281 --> 02:57:41.317
CONDITION IN WHICH ALL OF THOSE

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:44.320
GOALS AND UP SYNERGIZE. TO A

02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:45.354
COMMON.

02:57:45.421 --> 02:57:47.590
GOAL OF TRYING TO GET THE FOR

02:57:47.656 --> 02:57:48.124
INSTANCE THE RIGHT TYPE OF

02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:50.059
CONDITION.

02:57:50.126 --> 02:57:51.293
LET ME START WITH THE FACT THAT

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:53.529
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD HERE TODAY

02:57:53.596 --> 02:57:55.798
IT'S PRETTY INEVITABLE THAT BOTH

02:57:55.865 --> 02:57:57.533
DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE ARE GOING

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.068
TO BE INCREASING ITS THE NATURE

02:57:59.135 --> 02:58:00.870
OF THE BEAST WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

02:58:00.936 --> 02:58:01.971
WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO

02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:03.172
SUGGEST THAT THAT'S GOING TO

02:58:03.239 --> 02:58:04.840
CONTINUE TO BE A STRESSOR.

02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:05.875
ON FORESTS.

02:58:05.941 --> 02:58:07.309
SO WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS THINK

02:58:07.376 --> 02:58:08.377
ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THE

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:09.812
FOREST'S LESS RIGID MORE

02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:11.847
FLEXIBLE TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND

02:58:11.914 --> 02:58:13.182
RESPOND TO THESE TYPE OF

02:58:13.249 --> 02:58:14.283
CONDITIONS.

02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:15.618
GOING ON THERE.

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:17.586
AND WHAT WE OFTEN HAVE IN OUR

02:58:17.653 --> 02:58:20.222
FOREST'S NOWADAYS IS KIND OF A

02:58:20.289 --> 02:58:22.658
BINARY CONDITION --

02:58:22.725 --> 02:58:25.861
YOU KEEP FIRE OUT WHICH IS THE

02:58:25.928 --> 02:58:27.430
DOMINANT CONDITION IN MOST OF

02:58:27.496 --> 02:58:29.131
THE SIERRA NEVADAS AND MOST OF

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:30.032
THE MOUNTAINS.

02:58:30.099 --> 02:58:31.567
AND THE FORCE GETS REALLY CHOCK

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:34.070
FULL OF TREES IT'S VERY DENSE.

02:58:34.136 --> 02:58:35.571
IT'S VERY HOMOGENEOUS THERE

02:58:35.638 --> 02:58:37.039
ISN'T A LOT OF VERY ABILITY IN

02:58:37.106 --> 02:58:38.574
THE MICRO CLIMATE THE PLANT

02:58:38.641 --> 02:58:40.843
COMMUNITY IT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL

02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:43.646
CLOSE CANOPY AND THEIR OR WHAT

02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:44.847
HAPPENS IS YOU GET A BIG WILD

02:58:44.914 --> 02:58:46.282
CARD THAT COMES IN OR DROUGHT

02:58:46.348 --> 02:58:47.016
EVENT.

02:58:47.083 --> 02:58:49.452
AND ALMOST ALL THE TREES DIE.

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:50.719
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IT

02:58:50.786 --> 02:58:52.421
FLIPS TO BEING A VERY

02:58:52.488 --> 02:58:54.323
HOMOGENEOUS CONDITION BUT IN THE

02:58:54.390 --> 02:58:56.358
OTHER SENSE OF LACKING TREES

02:58:56.425 --> 02:58:59.095
MOSTLY DOMINATED BY SHRUBS.

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:01.730
AND IN EITHER CASE IS OUTSIDE

02:59:01.797 --> 02:59:03.199
THE RANGE OF HOW THAT FOREST

02:59:03.265 --> 02:59:06.569
DEVOLVED AND HOW IT RESPONDS. TO

02:59:06.635 --> 02:59:08.270
THESE KIND OF CONDITIONS BOTH

02:59:08.337 --> 02:59:09.572
DROUGHT AND FIRE WHICH IS

02:59:09.638 --> 02:59:11.574
EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST THIS IS

02:59:11.640 --> 02:59:13.375
OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THOSE TYPE

02:59:13.442 --> 02:59:14.510
THE CONDITIONS.

02:59:14.577 --> 02:59:16.445
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:18.247
WHEN YOU KEEP FIRE OUT OF IT. TO

02:59:18.314 --> 02:59:19.014
THE BIG THINGS THAT ARE

02:59:19.081 --> 02:59:20.883
HAPPENING IS YOU REALLY INCREASE

02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:22.384
THE FUEL LOAD IN THE FOREST

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:23.452
WHICH IS WHAT ALL THE SMALL

02:59:23.519 --> 02:59:24.920
TREES ARE DOING.

02:59:24.987 --> 02:59:25.654
AND THE OTHER THING TO THINK

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:27.823
ABOUT IS THE TREES ARE BASICALLY

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:28.991
STRAWS.

02:59:29.058 --> 02:59:30.759
AND YOU GET TOO MANY STRAWS IN

02:59:30.826 --> 02:59:31.927
THE GROUND.

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:33.395
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET

02:59:33.462 --> 02:59:34.697
A DROUGHT OF IT LIKE WE HAD A IN

02:59:34.763 --> 02:59:36.665
THE SIERRAS IN THE SOUTHERN PART

02:59:36.732 --> 02:59:38.033
WHICH IS TO THE PRIOR PART.

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:39.635
YOU END UP WITH A HUNDRED AND

02:59:39.702 --> 02:59:40.236
FIFTY MILLION DEAD TREES IN

02:59:40.302 --> 02:59:41.670
THERE BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH

02:59:41.737 --> 02:59:43.239
COMPETITION FOR THE WATER.

02:59:43.305 --> 02:59:44.707
AND SO THAT FORCE DOESN'T HAVE

02:59:44.773 --> 02:59:46.442
THE ABILITY MORE TO FLEX TO BE

02:59:46.509 --> 02:59:48.077
ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE KIND OF

02:59:48.144 --> 02:59:49.478
STRESSES.

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:52.047
AND WHAT WE HAVE FINALLY FIGURED

02:59:52.114 --> 02:59:54.016
OUT IS HOW TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:59:54.083 --> 02:59:56.285
THOSE FOR US MORE RESPONSIVE

02:59:56.352 --> 02:59:58.154
MORE FLEXIBLE TO THOSE TYPES OF

02:59:58.220 --> 03:00:00.055
CONDITIONS.

03:00:00.122 --> 03:00:01.157
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE

03:00:01.223 --> 03:00:03.025
KIND OF GETS VERY SPECIFIC HERE

03:00:03.092 --> 03:00:04.994
BUT I THINK IT'LL SHOW HOW WE

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:06.962
CAN ACTUALLY BRING THESE THINGS

03:00:07.029 --> 03:00:09.265
SYNERGISTICALLY TO BENEFIT ALL

03:00:09.331 --> 03:00:10.633
OF THE RESPONSES.

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:11.800
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:13.636
FORESTRY HAS FOCUS ON FOR THE

03:00:13.702 --> 03:00:17.873
LAST. FIFTY SIXTY YEARS IS BIG

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:19.608
TREES QUICKLY BOTH FOR BOARD

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:21.944
FEET FOR FIBER FOR ALL OF THOSE

03:00:22.011 --> 03:00:22.711
KIND OF PRODUCTS.

03:00:22.778 --> 03:00:25.548
AND ONE OF THE WAYS OF DOING

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:28.050
THAT IS WHEN THE TREES ARE GONE --

03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:29.919
YOUR RE PLANTING AREA YOU PLANT

03:00:29.985 --> 03:00:32.321
TREES IT VERY REGULAR SPACING SO

03:00:32.388 --> 03:00:33.956
THE OPTIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SPACE

03:00:34.023 --> 03:00:35.891
THEY HAVE TO GROW IN AND THEY

03:00:35.958 --> 03:00:37.326
CAN GROW REALLY FAST QUICKLY.

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:39.395
WORKS FOR CORN ALSO WORKS FOR

03:00:39.461 --> 03:00:40.663
TREES NOT TO SAY THE TREES ARE

03:00:40.729 --> 03:00:42.498
CORN BUT THEY DO HAVE THE SAME

03:00:42.565 --> 03:00:43.599
KIND OF RESPONSE.

03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:44.900
THAT'S THE WAY WE WOULD HAVE

03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:47.636
RESPONDED A LOT OF CASES TO

03:00:47.703 --> 03:00:49.171
THESE FORESTS BEING BURNT OVER

03:00:49.238 --> 03:00:50.539
OR TO THE TREES DYING FROM

03:00:50.606 --> 03:00:52.174
DROUGHT.

03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:53.475
BUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:54.944
SPECIFICALLY WITH A LOT OF

03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:56.645
RESEARCH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

03:00:56.712 --> 03:00:58.347
IS ACTUALLY THE SPATIAL

03:00:58.414 --> 03:01:00.216
ARRANGEMENT OF THE TREES REALLY

03:01:00.282 --> 03:01:01.450
MATTERS.

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:03.385
AND IN PARTICULAR THAT

03:01:03.452 --> 03:01:05.988
ARRANGEMENT MAKES THE TREES MORE

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:07.823
RESILIENT TO BOTH WILDFIRE AND

03:01:07.890 --> 03:01:09.358
TO DROUGHT.

03:01:09.425 --> 03:01:11.727
SO AGAIN AN EXAMPLE HERE.

03:01:11.794 --> 03:01:12.561
WE WOULD HAVE SPACE TO TREAT

03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:14.463
EVENLY TO MAKE THEM GROW FAST IN

03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:16.198
THE PAST WE NOW KNOW THAT WE'LL

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:17.933
WE'D LIKE TO DO IS HAVE THEM

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.301
GROW IN CLUMPS.

03:01:19.368 --> 03:01:20.769
WITH OPENINGS IN BETWEEN THEM

03:01:20.836 --> 03:01:24.006
AND SCATTERED INDIVIDUAL TREES.

03:01:24.073 --> 03:01:25.441
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THAT.

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:27.376
IT TURNS OUT THAT THOSE OPENINGS

03:01:27.443 --> 03:01:28.944
IN THAT KIND OF ARRANGEMENT

03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:32.081
MAKES THE FOREST VERY RESILIENT

03:01:32.147 --> 03:01:32.615
TO WILDFIRE WHEN IT COMES

03:01:32.681 --> 03:01:33.549
THROUGH.

03:01:33.616 --> 03:01:36.318
IT ALSO MAKES THE FOREST VERY

03:01:36.385 --> 03:01:38.420
RESILIENT TO DROUGHT STRESS.

03:01:38.487 --> 03:01:40.389
AND THAT IS NOT A WAY THAT WE

03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:41.824
WOULD HAVE MANAGE FOR US WHEN WE

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:43.859
WERE MANAGING THEM FOR

03:01:43.926 --> 03:01:45.794
MAXIMIZING BOARD FEET OR TREE

03:01:45.861 --> 03:01:47.396
GROWTH PATTERNS.

03:01:47.463 --> 03:01:49.698
BUT THAT KIND OF OPEN GAP GROUP

03:01:49.765 --> 03:01:51.433
TYPE THE STRUCTURE IT ENDS UP

03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.502
BEING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR

03:01:53.569 --> 03:01:55.170
BREAKING THE FOREST RESILIENT TO

03:01:55.237 --> 03:01:56.505
WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE

03:01:56.572 --> 03:01:57.773
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.

03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:59.775
THESE MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE OF

03:01:59.842 --> 03:02:01.477
EXTREME DROUGHT EVENTS AND

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:02.811
EXTREME FIRE.

03:02:02.878 --> 03:02:04.113
AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP THAT

03:02:04.179 --> 03:02:10.252
POINT BECAUSE IT'S A BENEFIT NOT

03:02:10.319 --> 03:02:12.488
ONLY TO THE FOREST'S RESILIENCE

03:02:12.554 --> 03:02:13.856
IS GOING ON THERE.

03:02:13.922 --> 03:02:15.157
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT'S

03:02:15.224 --> 03:02:16.692
ACTUALLY REALLY IMPROVING WITH

03:02:16.759 --> 03:02:18.494
IT IS WATER.

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:20.562
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS IF

03:02:20.629 --> 03:02:22.398
YOU HAD AS LAURIE WAS ALLUDING

03:02:22.464 --> 03:02:23.599
TO IF YOU HAVE REALLY DENSE

03:02:23.666 --> 03:02:24.833
TREES ALL WITH THE CROWNS

03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:25.934
TOUCHING EACH OTHER.

03:02:26.001 --> 03:02:27.336
WHEN THE SNOW COMES DOWN IN THE

03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:29.571
WINTER TIME IT STAYS IN THE TOPS

03:02:29.638 --> 03:02:30.572
OF THE CROWNS?

03:02:30.639 --> 03:02:32.141
SOME OF IT MELTS AND GETS DOWN

03:02:32.207 --> 03:02:33.742
INTO THE GROUND BUT A LOT OF IT

03:02:33.809 --> 03:02:35.744
SUBLIMATES WHICH MEANS IT JUST

03:02:35.811 --> 03:02:36.345
GOES STRAIGHT FROM THE SNOW

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:37.146
STAGE.

03:02:37.212 --> 03:02:38.514
BACK TO WATER VAPOR IN THE

03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:40.382
ATMOSPHERE YOU LOSE ALL THAT

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:41.583
WATER.

03:02:41.650 --> 03:02:42.985
AND AS BEST AS WE CAN TELL YOU

03:02:43.052 --> 03:02:45.921
PROBABLY INCREASE WATER YIELDS

03:02:45.988 --> 03:02:48.924
OUT OF THE SYSTEMS BY 10220%.

03:02:48.991 --> 03:02:50.426
BY HAVING SOME OF THESE OPENINGS

03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:51.927
SO THAT ALL THE SNOW ENDS UP

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:54.029
DOWN ON THE GROUND RATHER THAN

03:02:54.096 --> 03:02:54.763
STUCK UP IN THE TOPS OF THE

03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:55.497
TREES.

03:02:55.564 --> 03:02:56.965
YOU CAN HAVE THE OPENINGS TO BIG

03:02:57.032 --> 03:02:59.335
YOU CAN HAVE MASSIVE CLEAR CUTS.

03:02:59.401 --> 03:03:00.636
BECAUSE THEN ALL THE SUN COMES

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:02.371
AND IT MELTS THE WATER AND

03:03:02.438 --> 03:03:03.238
BASICALLY FLUSHES --

03:03:03.305 --> 03:03:04.773
THE SYSTEM WITHOUT A STORAGE

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:05.808
ABILITY.

03:03:05.874 --> 03:03:08.143
SO YOU NEED THIS KIND OF PATTERN

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:09.278
AND THIS IS WHY IT'S SO

03:03:09.345 --> 03:03:11.513
IMPORTANT THE PATTERN AND THE

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:12.815
ARE KIND OF UNDERSTANDING

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:14.683
RESILIENCE TO PRODUCE THESE KIND

03:03:14.750 --> 03:03:15.818
OF CONDITIONS.

03:03:15.884 --> 03:03:17.886
FUTURE NOT ONLY GONNA MAKE THE

03:03:17.953 --> 03:03:20.189
FORCE MORE RE.

03:03:20.255 --> 03:03:21.890
YOUR PRODUCE MORE WATER COMING

03:03:21.957 --> 03:03:23.425
OUT OF THE END OF IT.

03:03:23.492 --> 03:03:25.394
END YOUR INCREASE THE STORAGE

03:03:25.461 --> 03:03:27.830
CAPACITY BECAUSE MORE THAT WATER

03:03:27.896 --> 03:03:29.198
IS STAYING AS SNOW.

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:31.066
RATHER THAN JUST ENDING UP AS

03:03:31.133 --> 03:03:32.301
BEING FLUSHED DOWN THE SYSTEM

03:03:32.368 --> 03:03:33.702
WHEN IT MELTS OUT DUE TO THE

03:03:33.769 --> 03:03:34.903
SUNLIGHT.

03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:35.904
SO IT'S JUST IT'S A FAIRLY

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:37.506
SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT IT'S ONE OF

03:03:37.573 --> 03:03:38.807
THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WORKED

03:03:38.874 --> 03:03:40.542
AT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

03:03:40.609 --> 03:03:41.844
HOW TO MAKE THE SYSTEMS

03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:44.413
SYNERGISTICALLY BENEFITING?

03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:46.115
FIRE RESILIENCE DROUGHT

03:03:46.181 --> 03:03:47.950
RESILIENCE AND WATER THROUGH PUT

03:03:48.016 --> 03:03:49.251
AT THE SAME TIME.

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:50.552
AND I THINK WE KNOW HOW TO DO

03:03:50.619 --> 03:03:52.221
THIS STUFF NOW BECAUSE WERE

03:03:52.287 --> 03:03:53.889
REALLY FOCUS LAST ON TIMBER

03:03:53.956 --> 03:03:55.991
PRODUCTION AND MORE ON MAKING

03:03:56.058 --> 03:03:58.360
THE FOREST ABLE TO WITHSTAND

03:03:58.427 --> 03:04:00.229
THESE TYPES OF CONDITIONS.

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:01.663
SO HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD IN

03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:02.865
SOME OF THESE THINGS.

03:04:02.931 --> 03:04:04.800
I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:07.236
IS THAT OUR RESPONSE SO FAR

03:04:07.302 --> 03:04:08.837
PARTICULARLY TO WILDFIRE.

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:11.240
AND ALSO FRANKLY TO DROUGHT HAS

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:13.742
BEEN A VERY REACTIVE RESPONSE.

03:04:13.809 --> 03:04:14.576
WE'RE SITTING THERE TRYING TO

03:04:14.643 --> 03:04:16.111
PUT ALL THE WILDFIRES OUT WHEN

03:04:16.178 --> 03:04:17.413
THEY COME ALONG.

03:04:17.479 --> 03:04:19.047
AND BASICALLY WE'RE NEVER GOING

03:04:19.114 --> 03:04:20.482
TO WIN THAT GAME.

03:04:20.549 --> 03:04:22.718
WE KNOW THE FIRES GET WORSE THE

03:04:22.785 --> 03:04:24.219
FUELS KEEP ON BUILDING.

03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:25.721
WE HAVE TO START WORKING WITH

03:04:25.788 --> 03:04:27.456
FIRE RATHER THAN ALWAYS

03:04:27.523 --> 03:04:28.624
SUPPRESSING IT.

03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:29.425
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:04:29.491 --> 03:04:30.692
SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF

03:04:30.759 --> 03:04:31.860
FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT AT THE CRUX

03:04:31.927 --> 03:04:32.995
OF THIS.

03:04:33.061 --> 03:04:33.629
IS ONCE WE REALIZED THAT WE'RE

03:04:33.695 --> 03:04:37.332
NEVER GOING TO IT'S INEVITABLE.

03:04:37.399 --> 03:04:38.801
WE HAVE TWO CHOICES WE CAN

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:40.002
EITHER CONTINUE THE ROUTE WE'RE

03:04:40.068 --> 03:04:42.771
DOING RIGHT NOW WHICH FRANKLY

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:43.372
THE FIRES KIND OF KICKING OUR

03:04:43.439 --> 03:04:44.173
*.

03:04:44.239 --> 03:04:45.207
OR WE CAN GET OUT THERE IN FRONT

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.942
OF IT AND TRY TO BE THE ELEMENT

03:04:47.009 --> 03:04:48.777
THE PUTS THE FIRE MORE ON THE

03:04:48.844 --> 03:04:49.645
LANDSCAPE.

03:04:49.711 --> 03:04:51.413
WHEN THE WEATHER PATTERNS IN THE

03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:52.815
WIND IS GOING TO MOVE THE SMOKE

03:04:52.881 --> 03:04:54.516
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WE HAVE BETTER

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:56.485
CONTROL OVER THE FIRE BURNING AT

03:04:56.552 --> 03:04:58.020
THE RIGHT TIME TO THE TENT CITY?

03:04:58.086 --> 03:04:59.621
SO THAT IMPROVES THE HEALTH OF

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:00.756
THE FOREST.

03:05:00.823 --> 03:05:02.791
AND WERE THE ELEMENT OUT THERE

03:05:02.858 --> 03:05:04.726
THAT ACTUALLY DETERMINING WHEN

03:05:04.793 --> 03:05:07.162
AND WHERE THE FIRE WORKERS TO

03:05:07.229 --> 03:05:08.530
MAKE ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL.

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:11.133
RIGHT NOW ABOUT 90% OF OUR FIRES

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.569
ARE NOT ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL

03:05:13.635 --> 03:05:15.370
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

03:05:15.437 --> 03:05:18.540
REALLY COULD CHANGE HAS TRIED TO

03:05:18.607 --> 03:05:19.174
PROACTIVELY GET OUT THERE FRONT

03:05:19.241 --> 03:05:19.975
OF IT.

03:05:20.042 --> 03:05:21.477
FINALLY ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

03:05:21.543 --> 03:05:22.744
PROBABLY HEARD A BUNCH OF ABOUT

03:05:22.811 --> 03:05:25.481
BECAUSE THIS IS IS A FAVORITE.

03:05:25.547 --> 03:05:27.850
DISCUSSION OF OF POLITICIANS IS

03:05:27.916 --> 03:05:29.485
PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU KNOW YOU

03:05:29.551 --> 03:05:31.186
REALLY CAN'T GET MORE FIRE OUT

03:05:31.253 --> 03:05:32.521
ON THAT LANDSCAPE.

03:05:32.588 --> 03:05:34.022
IN A STATE WITH FORTY MILLION

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:35.491
PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING

03:05:35.557 --> 03:05:36.992
TO TOLERATE THAT AMOUNT OF SMOKE

03:05:37.059 --> 03:05:38.293
THAT'S GOING ON THERE YOU CAN

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.661
HAVE TO THINK YOUR WAY OUT OF

03:05:39.728 --> 03:05:40.863
THIS PROBLEM.

03:05:40.929 --> 03:05:42.130
AND I GET KIND OF TIRED OF THIS

03:05:42.197 --> 03:05:44.433
DEBATE BECAUSE IT WAS REYES ONE

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:45.968
TIME TO ME AND I RAN ALL THE

03:05:46.034 --> 03:05:47.436
NUMBERS AND I WROTE A PAPER ON

03:05:47.503 --> 03:05:48.203
THIS.

03:05:48.270 --> 03:05:49.938
AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YOU

03:05:50.005 --> 03:05:51.507
CANNOT SEND YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS

03:05:51.573 --> 03:05:52.140
PROBLEM.

03:05:52.207 --> 03:05:54.543
THINNING IS HELPFUL IS VERY

03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:55.911
USEFUL DONE IN THE RIGHT PLACE

03:05:55.978 --> 03:05:57.379
YOU CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD.

03:05:57.446 --> 03:05:58.981
BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO START

03:05:59.047 --> 03:06:01.917
WORKING WITH AND SO THOSE TWO

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:03.619
THINGS HAVE TO GO TOGETHER AND

03:06:03.685 --> 03:06:05.454
RATHER THAN NATTERING EACH OTHER

03:06:05.521 --> 03:06:05.988
ABOUT -- WE

03:06:06.054 --> 03:06:06.922
CAN IN OUR WAY OUT --

03:06:06.989 --> 03:06:08.624
WE CAN BURN OUR WAY OUT FRANKLY

03:06:08.690 --> 03:06:10.893
NO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:14.563
WE CAN ALL THE TOOLS WE CAN TO

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:15.163
REALLY BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE

03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:16.164
FOREST.

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:17.466
SO FINALLY.

03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:18.800
WHAT KIND OF THINGS MIGHT BE

03:06:18.867 --> 03:06:20.002
ABLE TO HELP IN TERMS OF

03:06:20.068 --> 03:06:21.136
LEGISLATIVE ACTION OR WHAT'S

03:06:21.203 --> 03:06:22.771
GOING ON?

03:06:22.838 --> 03:06:24.273
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS

03:06:24.339 --> 03:06:26.575
THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR ABILITY TO

03:06:26.642 --> 03:06:28.143
WORK WITH AND USE FIRE.

03:06:28.210 --> 03:06:30.012
WOULD BE TO RETHINK OUR AIR

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:32.848
QUALITY REGULATIONS AND HOW AT

03:06:32.915 --> 03:06:33.749
PRESENT THEY ACTUALLY MAKE IT

03:06:33.815 --> 03:06:35.984
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE THE

03:06:36.051 --> 03:06:37.953
ELEMENTS.

03:06:38.020 --> 03:06:39.521
OF PUTTING FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE.

03:06:39.588 --> 03:06:42.357
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE IS.

03:06:42.424 --> 03:06:43.992
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE OUT IN THE

03:06:44.059 --> 03:06:45.360
FOREST.

03:06:45.427 --> 03:06:46.461
NOT WHEN IT'S ALL COVERED WITH

03:06:46.528 --> 03:06:46.929
SNOW.

03:06:46.995 --> 03:06:48.797
IN THE SUMMERTIME LOOK DOWN WHAT

03:06:48.864 --> 03:06:50.499
YOU'RE WALKING AROUND ON IT'S A

03:06:50.566 --> 03:06:52.467
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEAF LITTER

03:06:52.534 --> 03:06:55.103
AND BRANCHES AND SO FORTH AND

03:06:55.170 --> 03:06:56.004
YOU THINK.

03:06:56.071 --> 03:06:57.940
WOW THAT'S FUEL BUT IT'S NOT

03:06:58.006 --> 03:06:59.541
ALONE FUEL THINK THAT WHAT

03:06:59.608 --> 03:07:01.443
YOU'RE REALLY WALKING AROUND ON

03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:02.844
IS SMOKE.

03:07:02.911 --> 03:07:04.947
ITS SMOKE THAT IS WAITING TO

03:07:05.013 --> 03:07:06.548
HAPPEN.

03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:08.717
AND ALTHOUGH THAT LEAF LITTER

03:07:08.784 --> 03:07:11.153
AND BRANCHES KONDIK HEY.

03:07:11.219 --> 03:07:13.155
IT'S COMING IN EVEN FASTER FROM

03:07:13.221 --> 03:07:15.257
THE TREES AND IT IS DECAYING OUT

03:07:15.324 --> 03:07:17.125
THE OTHER WAY SO YOU'RE ALWAYS

03:07:17.192 --> 03:07:18.794
GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST THAT

03:07:18.860 --> 03:07:19.928
LEVEL SMOKY YOU'RE WALKING

03:07:19.995 --> 03:07:21.930
AROUND ON AND THE LONGER YOU

03:07:21.997 --> 03:07:23.231
DELAY PUTTING FIRE INTO THE

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:24.166
SYSTEM.

03:07:24.232 --> 03:07:26.001
THE MORE SMOKE YOU'RE EVENTUALLY

03:07:26.068 --> 03:07:27.269
GOING TO PRODUCE.

03:07:27.336 --> 03:07:29.371
YOU CAN HAVE THAT SMOKE HAPPEN

03:07:29.438 --> 03:07:31.073
LIKE INTO RIMFIRE EVENT WE'RE

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:33.241
ALL GOES UP AND GETS DUMPED ON

03:07:33.308 --> 03:07:34.643
RENO AND EXPOSES THINK WE

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.445
CALCULATED SEVEN MILLION PERSON

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:38.747
DAY'S WORTH OF EXPOSURE DURING

03:07:38.814 --> 03:07:40.082
THAT KIND OF FIRE EVENT.

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:42.451
OR AGAIN WE CAN BE THE ELEMENTS

03:07:42.517 --> 03:07:43.752
PUTTING THE FIRE OUT ON THEIR

03:07:43.819 --> 03:07:45.821
WHEN THE CONDITIONS LOFT THAT

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:48.323
SMOKE WAY UP AWAY FROM PEOPLE OR

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:50.559
TAKE IT AWAY FROM URBAN AREAS.

03:07:50.626 --> 03:07:52.961
AND THE CALCULATION WE ESTIMATED

03:07:53.028 --> 03:07:55.631
IS YOU WOULD HAVE LESS THAN ONE

03:07:55.697 --> 03:07:57.566
SEVEN THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S

03:07:57.633 --> 03:07:58.500
HEALTH.

03:07:58.567 --> 03:08:01.436
THE WOOD BY WALKING AWAY WHICH

03:08:01.503 --> 03:08:03.605
IS WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING

03:08:03.672 --> 03:08:05.240
AND LETTING THE RIMFIRE EVENT

03:08:05.307 --> 03:08:06.742
TAKE ALL THAT LEAFLET HER.

03:08:06.808 --> 03:08:08.577
AND PUT ALL THAT SMOKE INTO THE

03:08:08.644 --> 03:08:09.845
AIR AT THAT TYPE OF TIME.

03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:11.546
SAYS ONE EXAMPLE BUT I THINK

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:13.081
THAT IF WE GET MORE PROACTIVE

03:08:13.148 --> 03:08:14.850
ABOUT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM.

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:16.385
AND WE START BEING SOME OF THE

03:08:16.451 --> 03:08:17.352
ELEMENTS OF MAKING THE

03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:18.887
RECONSTRUCTION OF FOREST'S

03:08:18.954 --> 03:08:19.988
HAPPEN.

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:22.524
WE CAN BENEFIT WATER QUALITY AND

03:08:22.591 --> 03:08:26.061
QUANTITY CARBON STORAGE.

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:28.530
FOREST'S RESILIENCE WILDFIRE.

03:08:28.597 --> 03:08:30.332
AND BENEFIT AND RESTORE THE

03:08:30.399 --> 03:08:32.601
FOREST'S WITHIN THE STATE OF

TOP WHERE THE WATER'S COMING TO

03:09:07.102 --> 03:09:08.303

THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR FAIR

03:09:25.787 --> 03:09:27.456
SHARE -- AND

03:09:27.522 --> 03:09:28.056
TO JUST JUST A WE WERE HEARING

ABOUT WATER IN BEVERLY HILLS

03:09:31.927 --> 03:09:34.329
VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS --

03:09:34.396 --> 03:09:36.098
SO FIGURING OUT DUTY YOU YOU

03:09:36.164 --> 03:09:37.065
CAN'T EVEN BAY THAN SOME OF THIS

03:09:37.132 --> 03:09:39.968
WATER SO THAT THE PROBLEM IS

03:09:40.035 --> 03:09:41.737
MUCH BIGGER BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:09:41.803 --> 03:09:43.705
THE TOPIC FOR TODAY'S WILD FIRES

03:09:43.772 --> 03:09:46.108
AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

03:09:47.476 --> 03:09:48.977
DO TO MAKE SURE THAT --

03:09:49.044 --> 03:09:50.378
WE PROTECT THE WATERSHED THAT WE

03:09:50.445 --> 03:09:53.181
PROTECT THE THE LAND AND OF THAT

03:09:53.248 --> 03:09:54.783
THE ERROR THAT WE ALL BREATHE.

03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:56.251
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR

03:09:56.318 --> 03:09:58.954

03:09:59.020 --> 03:10:00.288
IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN.

03:10:00.355 --> 03:10:02.357
THAN WHAT WE SOMETIMES THINK AND

03:10:02.424 --> 03:10:04.426
YOU WE DO HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE

03:10:04.493 --> 03:10:05.927
THE BOX AND LOOK AT THE BOX WE

03:10:05.994 --> 03:10:07.329

03:10:07.395 --> 03:10:08.196
NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND

03:10:08.263 --> 03:10:09.898
SISTERS HAD THEIR WAY OF DOING

03:10:09.965 --> 03:10:11.466
THINGS AND MAYBE WE NEED TO GO

03:10:11.533 --> 03:10:12.901
BACK TO SOME OF WHAT.

03:10:12.968 --> 03:10:14.436
WAS DONE DURING THAT TIME WITH

03:10:14.503 --> 03:10:16.705
CONTROLLED BURNS AND SOME OF THE

03:10:16.772 --> 03:10:19.674
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE DONE.

03:10:19.741 --> 03:10:20.776
COULD I JUST MENTION THAT I

03:10:20.842 --> 03:10:21.610
THINK --

03:10:21.676 --> 03:10:23.311
YOUR POINT IS SO WELL TAKEN WHEN

03:10:23.378 --> 03:10:24.813
YOU THINK ABOUT INNER CITY LOS

03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:26.314
ANGELES.

03:10:26.381 --> 03:10:27.983
THE MOST RELIABLE AND CHEAPEST

03:10:28.049 --> 03:10:28.884
WATER.

03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:30.652

THROUGH THE STATE AND WATER

03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:35.590
SYSTEM SO THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE

03:10:35.657 --> 03:10:37.526
FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WE OFTEN

03:10:37.592 --> 03:10:38.994
KNOW OR FEEL OR SEE.

03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.629

THE WATERSHEDS. FOR EXAMPLE

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:45.000
AROUND REGULAR INFLOW.

03:10:45.066 --> 03:10:46.668
INTO THOSE HOLDING SYSTEMS THAT

03:10:46.735 --> 03:10:48.103
ARE THE RESERVOIRS ON THAT PIPES

03:10:48.170 --> 03:10:49.404
AND CANALS THAT WE THINK OF AS

03:10:49.471 --> 03:10:50.672

03:14:56.184 --> 03:14:57.052
RESILIENCY PROJECTS THAT

03:14:57.118 --> 03:14:58.486
CONSERVE NATURAL WORKING LANCE

03:14:58.553 --> 03:15:00.355
RELEASED FIFTY YEARS. FOR THE

03:15:00.422 --> 03:15:01.556
BENEFIT OF CRIME ADAPTATION AND

03:15:01.623 --> 03:15:03.792
RESILIENCE WILDLIFE AND TO

03:15:03.858 --> 03:15:05.260
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT.

PRIORITIZE THE CONSERVATION AND

03:15:09.164 --> 03:15:10.899
MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL WORKING

LANDS PROVIDES ASSISTANCE FOR

03:15:12.434 --> 03:15:13.968
NETWORKING AND MANAGERS AND

03:15:14.035 --> 03:15:15.503
SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE.

03:15:15.570 --> 03:15:16.971
RURAL URBAN COORDINATION ON

03:15:17.038 --> 03:15:18.740
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION WE

03:15:18.807 --> 03:15:20.275
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:15:20.341 --> 03:15:20.809
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS

03:15:20.875 --> 03:15:24.546
IMPORTANT CLIMATE ADAPTATION

03:15:24.612 --> 03:15:31.753
PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET THANK YOU.

03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:32.954
A GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN A WIKI

03:15:33.021 --> 03:15:34.255
WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL

03:15:34.322 --> 03:15:36.624
DIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO

03:15:36.691 --> 03:15:38.993
THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS

03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:41.362
PANEL A TO THE COMMITTEES --

03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:42.864
I DON'T THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH

03:15:42.931 --> 03:15:44.866
ALL OF THE SPECIFICS AND DETAILS

03:15:44.933 --> 03:15:47.635
WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BUT I AM.

03:15:47.702 --> 03:15:50.105
VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE'RE

03:15:50.171 --> 03:15:52.073
FINALLY TO SEE THIS DISCUSSION

03:15:52.140 --> 03:15:54.676
WERE DIGGING INTO THIS ASPECT OF

03:15:54.742 --> 03:15:56.311
THE ISSUE --

03:15:56.377 --> 03:15:58.580
I THINK THE TALKING ABOUT THE

03:15:58.646 --> 03:16:00.348
LARGE SCALE PLANNING.

03:16:00.415 --> 03:16:03.718
AND WILDLIFE IMPACTS AS WELL AS

03:16:03.785 --> 03:16:06.554
THE THE THE ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA

03:16:06.621 --> 03:16:08.189
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:09.557
OF OUR DISCUSSION IN FACT

03:16:09.624 --> 03:16:12.227
CONTINUES.IN MANY WAYS TO BE LEFT OUT

03:16:12.293 --> 03:16:13.795
BECAUSE SO OFTEN ARE FUNDING AND

03:16:13.862 --> 03:16:16.498
OUR ACTION ON THIS IS DRIVEN BY

03:16:16.564 --> 03:16:18.500
THE CRISES WHEN COMMUNITIES

03:16:18.566 --> 03:16:20.869
HOMES AND LIVES ARE THREATENED.

03:16:20.935 --> 03:16:24.272
AND ON THAT I WANT TO I WANT TO

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:25.640
THE END AND THE SPEAKERS TODAY

03:16:25.707 --> 03:16:27.008
IS LIKE I FELT LIKE IT WAS

03:16:27.075 --> 03:16:28.977
IMPLICIT BUT THAT WE ARE

03:16:29.043 --> 03:16:30.778
STARTING TO SEE THAT DISTINCTION

03:16:30.845 --> 03:16:32.413
BETWEEN ALL OF THE WORK AND ALL

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.815
OF THE DIFFERENT THINKING THAT

03:16:33.882 --> 03:16:34.415
NEEDS TO BE DONE OUT IN THE

03:16:34.482 --> 03:16:34.983
FOREST.

03:16:35.049 --> 03:16:37.385
VERSES THE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE

03:16:37.452 --> 03:16:38.820
TO BE GIVEN FOR COMMUNITIES.

03:16:38.887 --> 03:16:41.089
HOUSES AND LIVES THAT THOSE ARE

03:16:41.156 --> 03:16:43.158
TWO SEPARATE THINGS THAT NEED TO

03:16:43.224 --> 03:16:45.927
BE DEALT WITH SEPARATELY AND AND

03:16:45.994 --> 03:16:47.729
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

03:16:47.795 --> 03:16:53.134
AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:16:53.201 --> 03:16:54.536
DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF

03:16:54.602 --> 03:16:55.937
SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND

03:16:56.004 --> 03:16:57.805
BIOMASS UTILIZATION CAME UP A

03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.174
FEW TIMES TODAY.

03:16:59.240 --> 03:17:01.342
AND I JUST WANTED --

03:17:01.409 --> 03:17:02.777
TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE STATE

03:17:02.844 --> 03:17:04.846
SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING NANI

03:17:04.913 --> 03:17:07.081
MISSION BIOMASS UTILIZATION.

03:17:07.148 --> 03:17:09.484
AND SHOULD ALWAYS PRIORITIZE --

03:17:09.551 --> 03:17:11.686
ECOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FIRST

03:17:11.753 --> 03:17:12.620
THAT.

03:17:12.687 --> 03:17:15.723
WE DON'T CREATE MORE OF A DEMAND.

03:17:15.790 --> 03:17:17.392
FOR WHAT THEN A PARTICULAR AREA

03:17:17.458 --> 03:17:19.661
CAN SUPPLY IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

03:17:19.727 --> 03:17:21.062
SENSE AS WE'RE TRYING.

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:22.564
TO SEQUESTER CARBON ON AYE

03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:24.065
LANDSCAPE.

03:17:24.132 --> 03:17:26.434
PRESS TO REMOVE TRAYS AND THEN

03:17:26.501 --> 03:17:34.075
BURN THEM AND PAUL HUGHES WITH

03:17:34.142 --> 03:17:35.476
FORCED FOREVER --

03:17:35.543 --> 03:17:37.212
WE FEEL GENERALLY VERY GOOD

03:17:37.278 --> 03:17:38.346
ABOUT THE INCOMING NEW SOME

03:17:38.413 --> 03:17:39.614
ADMINISTRATION IN THE HOPE IT

03:17:39.681 --> 03:17:40.815
HOLDS.

03:17:40.882 --> 03:17:42.283
FOR GOOD POLICY ON WILD FIRE

03:17:42.350 --> 03:17:44.719
RESILIENCE AND WATERSHED HEALTH.

03:17:44.786 --> 03:17:46.187
ARE SPECIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF

03:17:46.254 --> 03:17:47.422
CONTROLLED BURNING --

03:17:47.488 --> 03:17:48.856
AND WANT TO SEE MORE OF THAT OUT

03:17:48.923 --> 03:17:51.893
BUT WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE

03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:53.528
EFFORTS TO REMOVE.

03:17:53.595 --> 03:17:55.930
DEAD TREES EITHER IN THE FORM OF

03:17:55.997 --> 03:17:58.766
PRE FIRE OR POST FIRE SALVAGE

03:17:58.833 --> 03:18:00.134
LOGGING PROGRAMS.

03:18:00.201 --> 03:18:01.636
THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL

03:18:01.703 --> 03:18:04.138
ABOUT A INCREASING AND VERY

03:18:04.205 --> 03:18:05.873
LARGE GROWING UP BODY OF

03:18:05.940 --> 03:18:07.442
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SNACK

03:18:07.508 --> 03:18:08.843
FORESTS ARE GENERALLY LESS

03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:10.311
FLAMMABLE.

03:18:10.378 --> 03:18:12.213
THAN GREEN TREES THE FINE FUELS

03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:13.781
AND VOLATILE OILS DISAPPEAR

03:18:13.848 --> 03:18:16.751
FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER THE TREES

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:18.453
DIE.

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:19.520
AND THOSE FOREST'S SPEC FORESTER

03:18:19.587 --> 03:18:21.456
UNDER REPRESENTED HISTORICALLY

03:18:21.522 --> 03:18:23.258
AND IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:25.627
DIVERSITY RIVAL OLD GROWTH TREES

03:18:25.693 --> 03:18:26.961
ARE NOT THE ENEMY.

03:18:27.028 --> 03:18:28.696
HARDENING HOMES IS WHERE THE

03:18:28.763 --> 03:18:31.299
ACTION IS AT THERE ARE TWO

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:32.934
THINGS THAT WERE SUPPORTING THAT.

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:35.169
YOU'LL BE SEEING SOON WE HOPE

03:18:35.236 --> 03:18:37.372
ARE ONE IS US SENATE BILL NINE

03:18:37.438 --> 03:18:38.873
NO ONE CLEAN UP --

03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.242
WE FEEL IT WAS ENACTED IN HASTE.

03:18:41.309 --> 03:18:43.111
A AND NEEDS MORE ATTENTION TO

03:18:43.177 --> 03:18:45.913
THE MAXIMUM DIAMETER TREES THAT

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.949
CAN BE REMOVED WITH A NOTICE OF

03:18:48.016 --> 03:18:50.852
INTENT EMERGENCY HARVEST NOTICE

03:18:50.918 --> 03:18:52.153
OF INTENT.

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:53.888
A AM TO CAL FIRE RUDIMENTARY

03:18:53.955 --> 03:18:55.790
INSPECTIONS OF THOSE.

03:18:55.857 --> 03:18:58.593
OF ENOUGH OPERATIONS NEED TO BE

03:18:58.660 --> 03:18:59.961
PUT BACK IN PLACE.

03:19:00.028 --> 03:19:01.663
AND THE SECOND BIGGER ONE IS

03:19:01.729 --> 03:19:03.665
THAT THERE IS A CONFLICT WITHIN

03:19:03.731 --> 03:19:06.567
THE AGENCY RIGHT NOW CAL FIRE.

03:19:06.634 --> 03:19:09.437
IT'S 90% THE FIREFIGHTING AGENCY

03:19:09.504 --> 03:19:10.738
ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST AND

03:19:10.805 --> 03:19:12.974
BEST WE APPLAUD THAT WANT TO SEE

03:19:13.041 --> 03:19:14.342
THAT ROLE EXPANDED.

03:19:14.409 --> 03:19:15.576
BUT THERE'S LITTLE QUESTION NOW

03:19:15.643 --> 03:19:17.845
THAT IT IS DOING A THE

03:19:17.912 --> 03:19:19.180
SAFEGUARDING OUR PUBLIC TRUST

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:20.448
VALUES.

03:19:20.515 --> 03:19:22.216
<i><u>F WATERSHED HEALTH WATER</i></u>

03:19:22.283 --> 03:19:24.819
QUALITY WILDLIFE AND SO ON AT

03:19:24.886 --> 03:19:26.854
ROUTE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN ITS

03:19:26.921 --> 03:19:28.756
FORESTRY THAT IS TIMBER HARVEST

03:19:28.823 --> 03:19:30.124
REGULATION.

03:19:30.191 --> 03:19:31.893
AND FIREFIGHTING FUNCTIONS

03:19:31.959 --> 03:19:34.262
FORESTERS ARE TAKEN OFF LINE

03:19:34.329 --> 03:19:36.264
FROM THEIR FORESTRY DUTIES WHEN

03:19:36.331 --> 03:19:38.700
CALLED TO FIGHT FIRES WHICH IS

03:19:38.766 --> 03:19:40.168
ALMOST CONSTANT NOW.

03:19:40.234 --> 03:19:41.536
AND THERE IS AN INCREASING

03:19:41.602 --> 03:19:43.271
INTEREST IN SEPARATING THOSE TWO

03:19:43.338 --> 03:19:44.872
FUNCTIONS.%

03:19:44.939 --> 03:19:47.008
AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO CALLS FOR

03:19:47.075 --> 03:19:48.409
MORE EFFECTIVENESS AND

03:19:48.476 --> 03:19:49.944
EFFICIENCY.

03:19:50.011 --> 03:19:52.814
IN REGULATING LOGGING WE FEEL

03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:54.482
THAT SEPARATION WOULD DO THAT.

03:19:54.549 --> 03:19:56.818
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

03:19:56.884 --> 03:19:57.819
TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT SAID THAT

03:19:57.885 --> 03:19:59.487
MORE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT

03:19:59.554 --> 03:20:00.621
BETWEEN AGENCIES.

03:20:00.688 --> 03:20:02.757
ESPECIALLY IN NATURAL RESOURCES

03:20:02.824 --> 03:20:03.691
IS NEEDED.

03:20:03.758 --> 03:20:05.793
OUGHT TO SAFEGUARD PUBLIC TRUST

03:20:05.860 --> 03:20:07.395
VALUES IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT DO

03:20:07.462 --> 03:20:08.730
IT ALONE.

03:20:08.796 --> 03:20:10.531
SO WE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE CAL

03:20:10.598 --> 03:20:13.801
FIRES OF ACTIVITIES AROUND ITS

03:20:13.868 --> 03:20:15.169
CORE MISSION OF FIRE FIGHTING --

03:20:15.236 --> 03:20:16.904
LET FIREFIGHTERS DO WHAT THEY DO

03:20:16.971 --> 03:20:18.740
BETTER WITH LESS INTERFERENCE

03:20:18.806 --> 03:20:19.640
FROM.

03:20:19.707 --> 03:20:20.508
OF FORESTERS WHO ARE LESS

03:20:20.575 --> 03:20:22.310
TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED A LOT

03:20:22.377 --> 03:20:24.312
FORESTERS DO THEIR PARAMOUNT WE

03:20:24.379 --> 03:20:28.082
IMPORTANT JOB OF REGULATING THE

03:20:28.149 --> 03:20:30.651
END GREENHOUSE SEA QUEST

03:20:30.718 --> 03:20:30.952
[inaudible]

03:20:31.018 --> 03:20:33.020
STAY TUNED.

03:20:33.087 --> 03:20:36.624
CURRENTLY ON BACK AUTHORED A

03:20:36.691 --> 03:20:40.027
LEGISLATION THANK YOU.

03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:40.862
THANK YOU THERE'S NO MORE

03:20:40.928 --> 03:20:42.296
FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT THANK

03:20:42.363 --> 03:20:44.165
EVERYONE WHO ATTENDED TODAY WE

03:20:44.232 --> 03:21:00.515
WILL BE ADJOURNING
