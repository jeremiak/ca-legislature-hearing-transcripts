AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WERE VERY HAPPY TO BE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT ON JUSTICE OF THE COVERT PANDEMIC IN HOW WE CAN IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. AND IN ULTIMATELY MOVE FORWARD- TO COMMITTEES HAVE LONG TRIED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SAID IN A COVERT. INFLUENCE WORLD THAT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK THAT WE'VE SEEN REPORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING. CENTER AROUND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IMPACT FOR A FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE PRACTICAL FRANCISCO GOOD RESPONSE BUT ALSO IN THE JUSTICE RESPONSE IN THE ABILITY OF COURTS TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE. WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE STILL CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE THAT THAT THEY DESERVE. SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE CAN. ENSURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JUDICIARY BRANCH IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH THAT WE CAN BRING. TO ENSURE JUSTICE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING AS WE WOULD EXPECT.

IN SUMMER ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SERVICES MCCOURT'S FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY THE IMPACT ON. COVERT NON COURTS IS UNDENIABLE- WE'VE HAD MANY. BOTH INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE GONE A LONG WAY TO. TRYING TO. ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY'VE DONE SOME INNOVATIVE THINGS AND WE CONGRATULATE THEM- WE MADE STRIDES IN TERMS OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS- WE'VE ENACTED LEGISLATION TO. ENABLE DISCOVERY- DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. BOTH FOR WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IN ANTICIPATION OF THE NEXT.

OUR COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AT EVERY LEVEL OF COURT TRIAL COURT APPELLATE COURT- SHE HAS BEEN AN INNOVATOR. AND IN FACT SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO YES TO THE FIRST QUARTER IN SACRAMENTO. THAT WAS DEDICATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. SHE HAS ADDRESSED THE HERCULEAN TASK OF MAKING SURE THE COURTS AS WE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO. REMAIN OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN SO MANY AREAS- SHE HAS BEEN AN INNOVATIVE LEADER. OF THIS YEAR WITH DIRECTIONS EVICTIONS BEING. A AN ACUTE ISSUE FOR THE COURTS AND FOR CALIFORNIANS- SHE HAS LED THE WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT. THERE IS SOME RELIEF- BOTH IN TERMS OF THE ACCESS TO COURTS IT IS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO BEING ABLE TO STAY IN ONE'S ABODE- AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. IS THE DAM IS THE PANDEMIC ENTERS ITS SECOND YEAR THE CHIEF JUSTICE CONTINUES TO LEAD THE JUDICIARY WITH VISION AND DETERMINATION AND WE'RE MOST GRATEFUL. FOR HER TAKING THE TIME. OUT OF HER VERY BUSY IMPORTANT SCHEDULED TO VISIT WITH US HERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS. WITH THAT- MAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF IF YOU'RE HERE WE WELCOME YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON IT IS A PLEASURE AND A PRIVILEGE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU HOWEVER REMOTELY BUT I AM SAYING FIRST TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OF WISE COUNSEL AND LEADERSHIP AS TOGETHER WE HAVE WORKED ON SOME VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES AND TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN FRANK BUT ALWAYS WITH GOOD INTENTIONS WILL BE AT THE STATE WILL WORK I LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE YEARS OF THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP. AND THANK YOU SENATOR- BURKE ALSO. YOU ARE OUR NEWEST MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH I CHAIR AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR FIRST MEETING TOGETHER LAST MONTH. AS WELL AS OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN BETWEEN I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND RELY ON BOTH YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES. PRACTICAL WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE AS WE LEAD JUSTICE FOR IN CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH MY COLLEAGUES SOME OF THE PANELISTS AND PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OTHER ANALYSTS TODAY. TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AND I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS EXACTLY WE NOW KNOW IT IS AFFECTED AS YOU SAID SENATOR- BURKE EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE NO PERSON NO ENTITY. HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED BY THIS PANDEMIC BUT IN THE BEGINNING IN MARCH NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS I TOOK THE STEP OF PUBLISHING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT ADVISORIES. TO THE JUDICIARY REMINDING THEM IN CAJOLING THEM AND BRINGING TO THEM BEST PRACTICES WELL WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT SEVERAL THINGS WHAT THIS ONCE WHAT IT MEANT TO US AS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. AND HOW WE WOULD GO FORWARD TO PROTECT THE SAFETY NOT ONLY OF THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO AS IMPORTANT OUR COURT STAFF AND OUR JURISTS. AND AS YOU KNOW THOSE EIGHT ADVISORIES TURNED INTO THIRTEEN EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STATEWIDE ORDERS BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE PANDEMIC AT THIS TIME IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD THOUGHT HAD REACHED ITS APEX LITTLE DID WE KNOW OF THE SURGES TO COME AND THE DIFFERENT RULES. BUT IT WAS THIS VERY SAME PANDEMIC THAT FORCED THE LEGISLATURE. OUT OF SESSION FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS AND PART OF THE SUMMER. AND WE DECIDED WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STEP IN TO TEMPORARILY FILL THE VOID THAT WE KNEW YOU WOULD CONSIDER ONCE YOU CAME BACK FROM BEING OUT OF SESSION. AND THAT'S WHEN WE PASSED AS YOU HAVE REFER TO THE ORDER THAT STOPPED UNLAWFUL DETAINER EVICTIONS THE ORDERS THAT SET NO BAIL BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED AS A JUDICIARY. ABOUT INFECTIONS IN THE JAIL AND PRISONS AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THAT INTO THE COURT HOUSES. YOU KNOW WITH A STATEWIDE RULES I WANT TO SAY ONE THING OR TWO THINGS ACTUALLY STATEWIDE RULES AS YOU KNOW ARE RIFE WITH CHALLENGE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS SO DIVERSE. I STATEWIDE RULES ARE RIFE WITH CHALLENGE BECAUSE SO MANY TIMES WE ARE OFTEN ACCUSED AT LEAST I HAVE BEEN IN MYRIAD LAWSUITS IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURT. OF UNDERMINING LOCAL DIVERSE LEADERSHIP. OF PRESUMING SUPERIORITY WITH ABSTRACT WISDOM OVER BOOTS ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE AND TRUST. AND STATEWIDE ORDERS ALSO CAN BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CULTURE OF THE COMMUNITY. I KNOW YOU YOURSELVES ARE GRAPPLING WITH UNIFORM STATEWIDE ORDERS HAVING TO DO WITH SCHOOLS AND SPORTS AND- VACCINE ROLLOUTS AS WELL AS- A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHERE IT SEEMS SO SIMPLE TO SAVE A STATEWIDE RULE WOULD WORK. BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE BANDAID THAT REALLY SUFFICES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION TO THE THIRTEEN PASSED STATEWIDE EMERGENCY ORDERS. I HAVE REVIEWED IN MY CAPACITY CHAIR AND CHIEF. OVER FOR AND SEVENTY EMERGENCY ORDERS. REQUESTED BY THE PRESIDING JUDGES OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS NOW IT MAKES AN EMERGENCY ORDER UNDER SIXTY EIGHT ONE ONE FIVE IS NOT IN YOUR PAGE. IT IS PAGES AND PAGES OF REASON AND MATERIAL THAT BACKS UP THIS REQUEST BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE ELECTED BY HIS OR HER PEERS. TO PROPER FOR ME TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY THAT THEY CAN USE AS NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL OR AND OR STATUTORY PROVISIONS REGARDING. BOTH CRIMINAL AND SOME CIVIL MATTERS OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND COUNTING EXECUTIVE OUR EMERGENCY ORDERS AND YOU ASK WHY SO MANY ORDERS FRANKLY I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION. WHEN I READ THROUGH THE MATERIAL SUBMITTED BY THE PRESIDING JUDGES OF EACH COUNTY ASKING FOR AN EMERGENCY ORDER THE SITE TO THE MYRIAD CHANGING LOCAL HELP ORDERS. THE MYRIAD CHANGING STATEWIDE ORDERS THE DIFFERENT. THAT THE DIFFERENT EXPERTS. THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZES OF COURTROOMS AND HERE IS THE KEY. OUT RIGHT FEAR OF JURORS TO COME TO COURT. JUDGES ARE PUT IN A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE SO MANY PEOPLE TO COME TO COURT SO THAT. AN ACCUSED MAY HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. ARIF TO COME IT'S NOT THE THEY DON'T WANT TO FEEL OUT THE RISK OF OTHER DUTY THERE ARE FREIGHT EVEN THOUGH THE COURTS HAVE PLEXIGLAS AND THERMOMETERS I EVERY MATTER OF PROTECTIVE GEAR. WHO CAN BLAME TEACHERS FOR BEING AFRAID NO I USED TO BE A TRIAL ATTORNEY I MYSELF DON'T WANNA JUROR WHO'S AFRAID TO BE IN COURT WITH ME. AND SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT BUT IMPORTANTLY TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN WITH THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY I MERGING SEE ORDERS ARE COURTS HAVE NEVER CLOSED I AM AWARE OF ONLY TWO COURTS THAT CLOSED. DURING THE INITIAL PERID OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS PRIMARILY TO CLEAN TO START UP AND START OVER. BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BASED ON MY READING OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND COUNTY EMERGENCY ORDERS. ALL COURTS HAVE REMAINED OPEN THEY OFFER REMOTE HEARINGS MANY ARE OFFERING JURY TRIALS BUT THE JURY TRIALS ARE BEING INTERRUPTED BECAUSE A JUROR IS EXPOSED A STAFFER IS EXPOSED AN INMATE IS EXPOSED AND THEY END UP BEING MISS TRIED AND WE START OVER AGAIN. ADDITIONALLY TO BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF COURTHOUSES SORT OF LIKE SCHOOLS WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE NUMBERS AND CRITICAL MASS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE. SO OUR BRICK AND MORTAR IS SOMEWHAT A BARRIER TO THE ABILITY TO CALL MASS GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO SIT FOR JURORS. SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AND A CONTRACTED OUT WITH GYMS AND SPORTS ARENAS IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN BRING IN JURORS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCE THEM TO SELECTORS. SO THIS IS A LONG WAY OF SAYING. THAT WHILE WE'VE BEEN OPEN AND IF WE'RE NOT WORKING ON THE CASE THE TRIAL JUDGE'S ARC ARE VALUABLE COURT STAFF OR COURT EMPLOYEES WERE NOT WORKING ON A CASE WE'RE MEETING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WITHOUT LEGAL AID WITH PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS WITH. DEFENSE LAWYERS WE'RE TRYING TO FOR FIND BETTER FOR WHERE HE IN THE- ABOUT WHAT WORKING WHAT ISN'T WORKING. I ALWAYS ASK FOR WHICH COUNTY ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS IN BECAUSE WE CAN GET MESSAGES AND HELP AND BEST PRACTICES TO THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY MAY BE A PROBLEM. BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR EYES AND EARS OPEN AND YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW THIS WHO IS IN OUR COURT NOW. WELL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COURT NOW ARE THE PEOPLE WHOARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STATUTORY LAW THAT LEGISLATORS BEFORE YOU HAVE SAID DESERVE PRIORITY. AND THOSE ARE PEOPLE ACCUSED OF CRIME PEOPLE WHOSE LIBERTY IS AT STAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CUSTODY. OF FAMILIES THAT ARE FALLING APART BECAUSE PARENTS SPOUSES PARTNERS HAVE LOST JOBS BECAUSE THEIR HOMES ARE AT RISK ALSO YOU KNOW WHO'S IN OUR COURTS. CHILDREN CHILDREN WHO IT'S UNSAFE IMAGINE THAT IT'S UNSAFE FOR THEM TO BE AT HOME NOW AND COURTS MUST. ADDRESS THE ENTIRE FAMILY TOGETHER. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE IN OUR COURTS NOW AND WE TRY TO HELP THEM IN THE MOST EFFICIENT AND REMOTE POSSIBLE WAY IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE ROOM FOR OTHER CASES LIKE SEVERAL OR OTHER CASES OR TRIALS. WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A CRISIS IN OUR POPULATION AND IF THERE IS CRISIS IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE. THE CRISIS AT HOME. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE HEARING TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO OUR COLLABORATION I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN DOING IN THE LAST YEAR WITH A WHERE WE WERE NOT FULLY FUNDED TO BEGIN WITH. BUT TO THE TRIAL JUDGES TO OUR COURT EMPLOYEES OUT THERE I HAVE NOTHING BUT THANKS GRATITUDE AND AWE FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING. AND I GIVE YOU STRENGTH BECAUSE YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH. THANK YOU. FOR THESE MOMENTS TO MAKE THESE REMARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHIEF JUSTICE. THANK YOU MADAME CHIEF JUSTICE I THINK WE VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP. WITH THEY- ARE ALSO LEGISLATURE YOUR ROLE AS A AS THE JUDICIARY AND THEY WERE ALL LEARNING ABOUT THE INTERPLAY AND HOW WE BEST AS AS TWO. BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT CAN WORK TOGETHER AND THE- YOUR LAST POINT THAT I THINK IS VERY WELL TAKEN THIS HEARING IS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST AND WAYS THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL AND TO PARTNER AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE CENTER. I'M GLAD THAT YOU MENTIONED THE COURTS FUNDING ISSUE IS WE'VE STRUGGLED WITH THAT OVER THE YEARS IN THE IMPACTS. THAT HAS LED TO A LACK OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS YOU AND YOUR COURTS VERY WELL NOW NOW WERE COMPOUNDED WITH THE COVE IT. CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND YOUR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. SO WE'RE NOT GONNA MOVE TO OUR PANELS WE HAVE FOUR PANELS WE HAVE A PRETTY LONG HEARING TODAY SO THE WAY I'D LIKE TO RUN THIS HEARINGS ALL INTERVIEWS THE PANELS WILL HAVE. THE FIRST PANEL SPEAK. AND THEN OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS FROM SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO THOSE PANEL MEMBERS IT'S OUR FIRST PANEL IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE UNPRECEDENTED IMPACT OF KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ON THE COURTS. AND COURT USERS SO WE'RE STARTING KIND OF TOP LEVEL AND WE HAVE THE HONORABLE MARLA- ANDERSON. THE SPIRIT WORD OF MONTEREY COUNTY FROM MY BACKYARD SO WHEN I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND SHE IS. THE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEGISLATION COMMITTEE. WE ALSO HAVE ROBERT- YOUNG THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO BE CHIANG C. A. O. C. THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT. FOR A STATE WIDE PERSPECTIVE AND I UNDERSTAND. WAS CHIANG HAS A VIDEO PRESENTATION. SO LET'S START WITH JUDGE ANDERSON. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TOUCH MARLEY ANDERSON AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT IS INDICATED CHAIRED THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEGISLATION COMMITTEE AND JUDGE YOUR MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND SENATOR I'M BURKE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COMMITTEES ON JUDICIARY. ON THE UNPRECEDENTED IMPACTS THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON CALIFORNIA'S COURTS AND ITS USERS INCLUDING THE COURTS RESPONSES TO THE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. AND THE COURTS CONTINUED EFFORT TO GATHER DATA TO INFORM TAX FORWARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL COURT USERS AND COURT PERSONNEL. HERE GO WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT TERMS SUCH AS MASK MANDATES LOCKDOWN SHELTER IN PLACE SOCIAL DISTANCING NONESSENTIAL SERVICES REMOTE WORKER BUILDING CAPACITY. A VACCINATION PARTY WOULD BE COMMON TERMS USED TODAY TO DESCRIBE HOW WE AS A SOCIETY INTERACT MAKE DECISIONS AND GO ABOUT OUR DAY. THE PANDEMIC SLOW DOWN HAS DEEPLY IMPACTED THE COURTS NOT UNLIKE THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE BUSINESS SECTOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION. IN LESS THAN A YEAR COURTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REINVENT THEMSELVES AND HAVE TRANSFORMED IN MANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE METHODS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC IS SERVERS. IN SOME RESPECTS FOR THE COURTS IT'S BEEN MUCH LIKE DESIGNING AND BUILDING AN AIRCRAFT WHILE IN FLIGHT. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE LOCKDOWN IN MARCH DIFFICULT OPERATION DECISIONS WERE MADE BY THE COURTS TO BALANCE HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS ACCESSIBILITY. AT THE OUTSET TO ENABLE RESUMPTION OF SERVICES IN TO AUTHORIZE COURTS TO OPERATE UNDER PANDEMIC CONDITIONS NOTWITHSTANDING OTHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS. COURTS REQUESTED EMERGENCY ORDERS FROM THE CHIEF JUSTICE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ADOPTED STATEWIDE EMERGENCY RULES OF COURT AND INDIVIDUAL COURTS ADOPTED LOCAL EMERGENCY RULES. THE SUMMERS AND THE GRAVITY OF PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS UNDER PANDEMIC CONDITIONS. WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF COURT USERS COURT PERSONNEL AND JUDICIAL OFFICERS WEIGHED HEAVY ON THE COURTS. TRIAGING BECAME NECESSARY. SERVICES SUCH AS TELEPHONE WAIT TIMES TIMES FOR CITY HEARINGS AND TRIALS AND DISPOSITION OF CASES WERE MODERATELY TO SEVERELY IMPACTED. HOWEVER AS TIME MOVED ON AND THIS TIME MOVE FORWARD AND DATA WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED COURTS BECAME BETTER POSITION TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ADAPTING AND EVOLVING SERVICES AND METHODS BY WHICH COURT USERS ARE SERVED. BUILDING ON FOUNDATIONS FROM PREVIOUS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS CORPS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SAFE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR. MOST COURTS RECONFIGURED PHYSICAL SPACE TO ENABLE PHYSICAL DISTANCING. THEY ALSO IMPLEMENTED REMOTE HEARINGS AND EXPANDED ON SITE LOCATIONS FOR JURY SELECTION. MANY COURT STREAMED HEARINGS AND PROCEEDINGS TO THE INTERNET AND OFFERED OTHER ONLINE SERVICES LIKE LIVE CHAT. AND REMOTE SELF HELP FOR EXAMPLE YOUR MODERATE COURT WHERE I SERVED WE IMPLEMENTED AN EMERGENCY LOCAL THAT PERMITTED PARTIES AND COUNSEL TO STIPULATE TO SUBMIT SYMBOL ON MOTIONS ON THE PLEADINGS WITHOUT APPEARANCES OR ARGUMENT. WE ALSO MOVE CIVIL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES TO VIDEO CANCERS AND WE ALSO PROVIDED STAGGERED HEARING TIMES AND THE OPTION TO PROMOTE APPEARANCE BY VIDEO OR TELEPHONE OR IN PERSON APPEARANCES FOR FAMILY LAW PROBATE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HEARINGS. WE PURCHASED PLEXIGLAS TO PROVIDE SAFETY FOR THE JURY BOX COUNSEL TABLE WITNESS STAND IN JUDGE'S BENCH. AT THE OUTSET SELF HELP STEP CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES TELEPHONICALLY AND IT WOULD HAVE TO PLACE OF REQUESTED DOCUMENTS OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE COURTHOUSE ON A CART AT A AND THEN WE PROVIDED A DROP BOX FOR THE DOCUMENTS TO BE PLACED IN THE DROP BOX FOR FILING. THESE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS WE ANOTHER COURTS ADAPTED TO PROVIDE ACCESS. HOWEVER NO MATTER THE SAFETY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED WE STILL HAD COURTS STAFF AND A JUDICIAL OFFICER TEST POSITIVE FOR THE COPA NINETEEN VIRUS I SEEN ANOTHER COURTS. RECORDS DURING MARCH TO DECEMBER IT WAS ADDITIONAL GROWTH IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY MOST NOTABLY IN THE AREAS OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES AND WEB BASED YOUR PROCESSING. AFTER THE SIGNIFICANT DROP IN COURT FILINGS IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC COURT FILINGS FOR MANY CASE TYPES HAVE RETURNED TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AS A COURTS WORK TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF KEEPING PACE WITH CASE LOADS. DATA WILL CONTINUE TO PROMPT US TO ASK QUESTIONS TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS. WE'VE MADE IT PAST THE TREE HOUSING STATE AND COURT LEADERSHIP HAVE COLLABORATED TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES CIRCULATING THE PANDEMIC CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDE. WE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH BALANCING HEALTH AND SAFETY DUE PROCESS AND ACCESSIBILITY CALIFORNIA'S COURT USERS. COURTS CONTINUE TO UPDATE THEIR OPERATION STATUS ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA'S SERVICE STATUS QUO BUT NINETEEN WEBPAGE. AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE VARYING WAYS THE DOORS OF THE COURTS CAN REMAIN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC WE SERVE. CONTINUING THE CHIEFS JUSTICE AXIS THREE D. PLAN FOR THE COURTS WHICH IS PHYSICAL REMOTE AND EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND I'M ROBERT A YOUNG OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF WALK THROUGH THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THE COURTS. WELL THANK YOU- JUDGE ANDERSON- MY NAME IS ROBERT O'DONNELL AND I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. THE COURT EXECUTIVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE SPONSORED A SURVEY THAT WENT OUT TO ALL TRIAL COURTS- IN AN EFFORT TO GATHER DATA TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. ON TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS ARE FIFTY FOUR OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COURTS WERE ABLE TO RESPOND AND I'D LIKE TO SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS FOR YOU- AS JUDGE ANDERSON MENTIONED TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ENHANCEMENTS. HELP MAINTAIN ITSELF ACCESS TO JUSTICE ARE WITH MOST COURTS IMPLEMENTING NEW TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE REMOTE AND ONLINE SERVICES. BALLCOURT USER SHELTER IN PLACE. OR WORK FROM HOME. SELF HELP CENTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN AND NOW PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF ASSISTANCE REMOTELY. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE SELF HELP INTERACTIONS OR FACE THE POINTS- THAT CHANGED ABOUT APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN BY AUGUST. 75% OF SELF HELP VISITORS CHOSE TO INTERACT WITH SELF HELP CENTERS REMOTELY. WHILE 25% OF THE VISITORS DECIDED TO VISIT THAT'S ALL HEALTH CENTERS IN PERSON. I PROVIDING THE WITH THE CHOICE OF HOW TO INTERACT WITH THE COURTS SOME PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SAVE TIME- TRAVELING OR STAY SAFELY AT HOME WHILE CONDUCTING THEIR CORE BUSINESS. WELL THERE'S COULD COME INTO A COURTHOUSE IF THAT WAS THEIR PREFERENCE. CORE PROCESSING SLOWDOWNS WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. IMPACTS OF WORKFORCE ABILITY AND AS THE CHIEF JUST MENTIONED DELAYS DUE TO EXPOSURE IN QUARANTINE RELATED TO COPE IN NINETEEN. WORK FOR CHEFS AND READ DIRECTIONS OCCURRED FOR ABOUT 5210% OF EMPLOYEES OR PANDEMIC SPECIFIC TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS TEMPERATURE MONITORING AT COURT ENTRANCES ADDITIONAL CALL CENTER WORK AND ADDITIONAL CLEANING. SOME COURTS EVEN BEGAN TO OFFER TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO THE PUBLIC TO HELP THEM CONNECT TO COURT SERVICES. AND THEN FINALLY DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED ABSENCES AND IT'S A PERCENT BUDGET CUT IN THE CURRENT YEAR ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE THE LADIES- WERE REDUCE- THE COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS. RESULTED IN AN AVERAGE 49% REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DISPOSITIONS IN% TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS REDUCTION WAS MOSTLY CONSISTENT BETWEEN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASE TYPES WITH CIVIL HAVING 49% YOUR DISPOSITIONS AND CRIMINAL HAVING 51% YOUR DISPOSITION. JUDICIAL OFFICER AVAILABILITY WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY PANDEMIC RELATED LEADS- AND JUDICIAL OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS FOR SPECIFIC CASE TYPES REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. WE HAVE HEARD SOME CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THE COURTS WERE REASSIGNING JUDICIAL OFFICERS FROM CIVIL ASSIGNMENTS TO CRIMINAL ASSIGNMENTS OR OTHER AREAS BUT OUR DATA SHOWS THAT ASSIGNMENTS RECEIPT OUT REMAIN CONSISTENT. CONTINUANCES FOR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES INCREASED AN AVERAGE 11% WITH CIVIL CASES BEING AFFECTED LESS THAN CRIMINAL CASES. ARE THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS A LAPSE FROM FILING TO THIS POSITION PERCIVAL UNLIMITED CASES WHICH INCLUDES COMPLEX CIVIL CASES INCREASED BY 18% AND THEN FINALLY THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HEARINGS PER CASE FOR CIVIL CRIMINAL AND TRAFFIC VERY- BASED ON LOCAL CONSTRAINTS AND PROCESS CHANGES SOME INCREASE SOME SAY THE SAME AND IN SOME CASES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HEARINGS DECREASE. ARE THE SURVEY RESULTS ARE STILL PRELIMINARY AND SOME FOLLOW UP IS NEEDED WITH THE COURTS BUT THE OVERALL THEME AND CONCLUSIONS ARE CLEAR- PROCESSING SLOWDOWNS ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. IMPACT THE WORKFORCE ABILITY AND DELAYS DUE TO EXPOSURE IN QUARANTINE RELATED TO COVERT NINETEEN. AS YOU HEARD FROM JUDGE ANDERSON OF THE CHIEF AND AS YOU WILL HEAR AN UPCOMING PANELS THE COURTS RECOGNIZE THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND HAVE TAKEN GREAT MEASURES TO ENSURE EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE IN PROVIDING CONTINUED ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GIVE US YOUR GOING ON AND FOR THE MEMBERS THE BACKGROUND PAPER INCLUDED. SOME DATA ON DISPOSITIONS OF CIVIL CASES WE JUST RECEIVED YESTERDAY CRIMINAL SO YOU'RE THERE THAT DATA HAS BEEN PROVIDED OUT TO YOU. AS WELL SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT HAVE BOTH. RIGHT WILL MOVE TO OUR THIRD PANELIST ON PANEL NUMBER ONE DOUBLE CHECK FROM CHAU SINCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AS SOON AS I BECAME THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE PRESIDENT OF C. O. C. WE IMMEDIATELY ABOUT WITH OUR CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO DISCUSS WHAT WE COULD ALL DO WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG OF CASES AND IN THIS PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC LAWYERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AGREED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND WORK TOGETHER. AND SO TOGETHER THE CEO SEE AND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL AND MEMBERS OF CALEDONIA SENT OUT A SURVEY TO ITS MEMBERS AND OVER NINE HUNDRED ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS RELATING TO PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PANDEMIC HOT SPOT AREAS OF CONCERN AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AS WELL AS REMOTE VIRTUAL TRIALS AND PRIVATE JURY. IT HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED IN A REPORT THAT IS BEING DISTRIBUTED TODAY. BY FAR THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN OF ALL ATTORNEYS IS THE INABILITY TO GET THEIR CASES TO TRIAL THE SETTING OF A TRIAL DATE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE LIFE OF THE CIVIL CASE IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MOVES THE CASE TOWARDS RESOLUTION WHEN THERE'S NO TRIAL DATE EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN WITH NO END IN SIGHT AND NO INCENTIVE FOR SELLING EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN LOWBALL NUMBERS. WITH WHAT'S BEEN NOW TERMED AS THE KOBE DISCOUNT AND AS A RESULT OUR CLIENTS ARE SUFFERING. FOR THOSE OF US THAT THE CDC WHO REPRESENT PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED THIS MEANS THAT OUR CLIENTS CAN I GET MUH NEEDED MEDICAL CARE OR COMPENSATION FOR LOST WAGES AND SO AS A RESULT THE LIVING CONTINUAL PAIN FEAR AND DISCOMFORT. AND FOR SOME SUCH DELAYS IN TREATMENT CAN RESULT IN SEVERE BACKSLIDING IN THEIR CONDITIONS AND EVEN DEATH BEFORE THEIR DAY IN COURT. AND THE ELDERLY AND THE VERY YOUNG ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR PREDICAMENT SO MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD SO WE ARE SHOWING YOU NOW A VIDEO OF TWO OF THEIR STORIES IN THE SERIES THAT WE'RE CALLING FACES OF THE PANDEMIC. AND NOW WE CAN ROLL THE VIDEO- JURIES TO CA CORE BUSINESS. OPEN. NINETY MARK. SIXTY SAN. ZERO VIDEO PLAYING ARMCHAIR WITH US WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF TECHNICAL. ISSUES IF SOMEONE ALLOWS ME TO SHARE I COULD SHARE IT ON MY SCREEN- HANG ON. WE CAN GET. WHAT. THE PREVIOUS OKAY IT'S GREAT. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS THERE A WAY TO ALLOW HER TO SHARE HER SCREEN IF SOMEONE ELSE TO BE CHAIRS I CAN SHOW IT ON MINE THEN WE'LL SEE IT IN THE SHOULD ALSO. OVER THE- LAKE. OKAY. YES SOMEONE LISTENING IN YEAH WORK HOLD ON WE'RE ON. WE. THE. GOOD IT IS NOT ENABLING IT. ONE OF THE PROBLEM. I'LL GIVE US A MINUTE. OKAY. YEAH WE'RE SHALL BE ON. OKAY WELL WE'RE WAITING FOR THE TECHNOLOGY TO KIND OF CATCH UP WITH US UNFORTUNATELY DUE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OF OUR FIRST PANEL. WITH THE CHILD CARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAYBE I'LL DO A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ARE IF I MAY- MY QUESTIONS DEAL WITH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY- TEKELI WITH RESPECT TO COURT HEARINGS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COURTS HAVE QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION WHEN IT COMES TO USE OF TECHNOLOGY AS TO WHAT TECHNOLOGY THEY WANT TO USE. OUR AND ALSO GRANTED THAT- YOU'RE DIFFERENT CASES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW SOME TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT WORK IN CERTAIN CASES. AND MY QUESTION IS SOLVED. USER IS- UNIFORMITY IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY- WHEN IT COMES TO LET'S SAY A COURT HEARINGS IN THE LIKE A PARTICULARLY REMOTE. ACCESS TO THE COURT SYSTEM. AND IF UP AND WHY AND WHY NOT. SO THIS IS ROBERT A YOUNG I CAN ANSWER THAT- REGARDING THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR. COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE THAT VERY IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS HAVE DIFFERING INFRASTRUCTURE SO I HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES AND REQUIRE DIFFERENT TOOLS- SO HE DON'T PRESCRIBE ANY PARTICULAR TOOL FOR THE COURTS. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDE THAT JUDGE ANDERSON MENTIONED A SET OF BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES THAT ALL COURTS- CAN TAKE A LOOK AT TO ENSURE THAT. THE PUBLIC- RECEIVED THE BEST- POSSIBLE- EXPERIENCE WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE COURT AND SO THESE ARE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THE VIDEO IS CLEAR MAKING SURE THAT THE AUDIO CAN BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE COURTROOM. SO ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE PRESCRIBED PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY WE DO HAVE A SET OF- BEST PRACTICES THAT THE COURTS CAN LEVERAGE TO ENSURE- A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR THE PUBLIC. SO DOES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MAKES A RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE USE OF- DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES OR IS IT ENTIRELY UP TO THE JUDGES HOW TO MAKE THE DECISION- SO IT'S TYPICALLY UP TO THE COURTS TO MAKE THAT DECISION- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL PROVIDE SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF. CAPABILITIES AND IN PARTICULAR- SECURITY- BUT AGAIN WE WON'T PRESCRIBE A PARTICULAR PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE QUOTE. THANK YOU. HERTZBERG THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN YES IT IS BT I WANT TO RAISE FOR THE RECORD THESE TWO POINTS ONE AND I KNOW THERE'S GREAT COMPETITION TO VACCINATE FOLKS BUT YOU KNOW. ESPECIALLY IN THE COURTS WERE- PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE COURT ROOM WITH SOME REFERENCES TO IT. IN OUR THIRTY PAGE PAPER. GERMAN GERMANS. PLAY READ THAT'S A COMPLIMENT THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE COMPLIMENT. I APPRECIATE IT- IT JUST TOOK ME LONGER THAN EXPECTED BUT- BUT WHERE WHERE THERE'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY CASES OF OUTBREAKS OF COALBED WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF PRO PERS COMING IN. YOU KNOW IN DEALING WITH CASES THEY'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IN THE COURTROOMS. A JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S BEEN THE EFFORTS TO VACCINATE- SOME OF THE JUDGES AND WORKERS AGAIN WE'VE GOT LIMITED RESOURCES I JUST RAISE IT IN THE- IN THE- ARRAY OF ISSUES THAT WE REYES. TALK ABOUT AND SECONDLY. IT'S ALLUDED TO AND- DIVERGING TALKS ABOUT. IT TALKS ABOUT IT IS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY EXPEDITE THOSE CASES WHERE. SOMEONE'S DYING OR THERE IS IT WE SEE THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES I KNOW THERE'S SOME THE GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT IT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN CASES WHERE TIMELINESS OF PRECEDING. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO PRESERVING EVIDENCE ORDER PRESERVING A CASE OF LITIGANTS OR WHATEVER TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT TO SOMEHOW- EXPEDITE THOSE PROCESS THESE- TO. TO DEAL WITH THOSE VERY SENSITIVE CASES PEOPLE ARE BEFORE. OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. I CAN ADDRESS THAT IF YOU'D LIKE AND THIS IS JAKE ANDERSONI THINK IT DEPENDS IN SOME RESPECTS ON THE COURTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO HERE IN MARIN COUNTY PRIORITIZE THOSE CASES- WE STILL HAVE OUR FULL A JUDICIAL. RESOURCES FOR THE CIVIL MATTER IN FACT I AM ASSIGNED TO THE CIVIL CALENDARS AND HAVE BEEN HANDLING THOSE CASES LIKE I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY SOME OF THE CASES WE ALLOW TO BE SUBMITTED ON THE PAPERS WITHOUT HAVING TO COME INTO COURT SOME OF THE PAPERS. SOME OF THE CASES WE HAVE PERMITTED TO GO BY WAY OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS EITHER THROUGH VIDEO. A SOME THROUGH COURT CALL IF IT'S NOT A TRIAL ITSELF SO WE DO EACH COURT WORKING THERE PASSED WITH UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAVE. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE PRIORITY CASES YES IT HERE TOO- WE ALSO HAVE PRIORITY OF JUVENILE MATTERS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MATTERS WE HAVE JUVENILE DEPENDENCY WE HAVE A JUVENILE JUSTICE YOU HAVE. PRIORITY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOUR PRIORITY FAMILY LAW MATTERS CUSTODY VISITATION SUPPORT AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PRIORITY TYPE CASES. AND THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICAL SPACE AND REMOTE SPACE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WORKED AT TRIAGE BUT ALSO KEEP THINGS IN THE PIPELINE ALL ALWAYS KEEP MOVING THINGS FORWARD. AND AS DATA BEGINS TO PRESENT ITSELF ON BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. BUT WE ARE WORKING HARD AT IT AND. I ASKED ONE CAN QUESTION. YEAH LINCOLN COURSE ALL THE FOLLOW PUSH WHICH IS MANY J. DO YOU AN MODERATE CONCERT MIKE. IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO. HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE- WE HAVE IN TERMS OF JUST OFFICER TO POINT TO I KNOW THE POINT TWO THAT'S A COMMISSIONER. BUT OUT OF THE- CASE. TWENTY TWO JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND IT ALSO DEPENDS AS WELL AS- IN YOUR ABILITY. IN MONTEREY COUNTY WERE FORTUNATE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A CRIMINAL BUILDING THAT'S IN SALINAS SEVERAL WAS IN MONTEREY. AND THEN WE HAVE JUVENILE AT A DIFFERENT PORT HOUSE. SO IT ALSO DEPENDS ON YOUR PHYSICAL SPACE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE- WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO AND PROVIDE. SO EACH COUNTY HAS ITS CHALLENGES I JUST LIKE WITH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. DEPENDING ON THE RESOURCES IN YOUR COUNTY IS DEPENDING ON HOW FAST. YOU CAN PROVIDE SERVICES BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT WORKING AS BEST YOU CAN. TO PROVIDE WHAT YOU CAN. WHERE YOU CAN AND CONTINUE TO DO BETTER. I THINK HEARING SUCH AS THIS HELPS. US TO UNDERSTAND. AND KNOW WHERE WE CAN BE BETTER. I DO THINK YOU'RE READY TO PAY THAT. DOWN IF ANYONE TO SEE IT. WE DO WE DO BUT HANG ON A SECOND SENATOR OTHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MY QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT. THE FUNDING- BUT YOU'VE GOTTEN AND- MAYBE FUNDING THAT YOU NEED. AND THE BACKLOG SO HOW DO YOU PLAN TO USE WILL BE WILL YOU BE USING THE MONEY FOR THE BACKLOG YOU RECEIVED LAST YEAR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE- PANDEMIC BACKLOG AND THEN- TO RESTORE YOUR ONGOING FUNDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION. BUT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS HOW YOU GET IT HOW DO YOU PLAN TO USE THAT FUNDING AND ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO- THE BACKLOG- AND THEN CONNECTED IS. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT TO RESTORE COURT OPERATIONS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. AND I I'M SO I'LL SEND IT- ALL. ENDED BY JUST SAYING IN LA I UNDERSTAND BETWEEN MARCH AND AUGUST OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN THEY WERE HUNDRED. FIFTY CIVIL CASES WERE RESOLVED IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND CASES AND YOU KNOW HOW HOW IS LOS ANGELES EVEN WITH FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY. EIGHTY TWO JUDGES HOW ARE WE ARE WE GET ADDRESS THAT BACKLOG. THE DRESS THAT FOR YOU AND THE MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO EACH ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS DEPENDING ON THEIR BACKLOG THE INITIAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS PRO RATA AND THE SECOND WAS BASED ON DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED BASED ON THE COURT'S BACKLOG IN EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS HAVE A PRESIDING JUDGE ASSISTANT PRESIDING JUDGE. AND THEIR OWN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND SO EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND BASED ON THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE SO WE CANNOT ANSWER UNIVERSALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT EACH COURT IS GOING TO DO FOR EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE YOU- JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING AND MONTEREY SUPERIOR COURT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES THAT LOS ANGELES MAY HAVE. I'LL GIVE YOU A PICTURE IF YOU HAVE A HUGE- CRUISE SHIP YEAH WITH THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS THEN YOU HAVE A SPEED BOAT OR KAYAK OLD ARM YOU KNOW MANEUVER DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OCEAN TE WHIMS AND EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE AND SO THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EACH ONE OF THE COURTS IS THAT THEIR LEADERSHIP IS DECIDING BASED ON DATA AND HAVING DATA AND FORM THEM. IN TERMS OF HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG HOW TO ASSIGN NOT ONLY JUDICIAL RESOURCES BUT STAFF RESOURCES- IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT MATTERS. ARE HEARD AND CASES ARE PROCESSED. AND WHAT YOU THINK AMOUNT IS TO. COURT UP LEVELS. AT THIS TIME WE'RE STILL GATHERING DATA- TO ASSESS THE BACKLOGS I BELIEVE THIS YEAR THAT CAN SPEAK WITH RESPECT TO THE PERCENTAGE OF BACKLOGS THAT EACH COURT HAS BASED ON OUR SURVEY BUT AS WE GATHER MORE DATA AS WE SEE WHAT COURTS ARE DOING IN ORDER TO WORK THROUGH- THE BACKLOG. HOW TECHNOLOGY IS ASSISTING AND HELPING WHETHER WE BALANCE PHYSICAL ACCESS REMOTE ACCESS AND MAKING SURE WE DO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS. THEN DATA WILL INFORM US IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR NEEDS WILL BE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO TO HIS REYES AND THEN WILL SEE MS CHANG'S VIDEO. I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE. BOB ONE THANK YOU- PERCENT GABRIEL- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE REMOTE TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE- ENDED FOLLOWING UP WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUE MYSELF HER- ON THE COST. OF THAT TALK ABOUT THE CONSPECIFIC LEAP FOR UPDATED TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT CAN ACCEPT THE REMOTE OR THAT TO BE THE ELECTRONIC FILINGS SOME CANNOT. SOME CAN PROVIDE THE REMOTE TO TURN HEARING SOME CANNOT SO EVEN IF WE LOOK AT THE MINIMUM THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO EACH OF THESE COUNTIES. HAS THERE ALREADY BEEN ASKED ABOUT ON THE COST JUST TO BRING THEM TO A MINIMUM. SO I CAN ADDRESS THAT PAIN IS ROBERT A YOUNG- IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE TOTAL COSTS- FOR BRINGING PEOPLE UP TO WHAT WOULD CONSIDERED EIGHT MINIMUM LEVEL HOW WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THAT AS A WHOLE. I AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION WHERE EACH OF THE COURTS HAVE- QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT DEPENDENCIES ARE REGARDING THEIR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE- THEIR LOCAL ABILITY TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGIES. AND SO THROUGH- FUNDING REQUEST BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS HOW WE AND THROUGH THE MODERNIZATION FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. I'LL WE HAVE ALLOCATED THAT OUT TO THE COURT SO THAT THEY CAN PRIORITIZE AND THEY CAN IMPLEMENT BASED ON THEIR LOCAL CONSTRAINTS- WE DO HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT BASICALLY OUTLINES. THE BASIC CAPABILITIES OF ELECTRONIC FILING- DIGITAL- DOCUMENTS- REMOTE HEARINGS AND AGAIN IT'S EACH OUR COURT HAS THEIR OWN. LIMITATIONS AND THEIR OWN- AREAS OF FOCUS BASED ON THEIR LOCAL POPULATION AND THEIR LOCAL PARK OPERATIONS. SO WE DON'T HAVE AN OVERALL COST FOR THAT HOWEVER EACH COURT IS. MOVING TOWARDS THAT AND STOP. THANK YOU. I THANK LET'S SEE CAN WE GET MISTRANSLATED- ON JURY SERVICE TO CONDUCTING COURT BUSINESS REMOTELY OPEN NINETEEN IS TURN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HERE UPSIDE DOWN. JURY TRIALS ARE CANCELED IN PERSON HEARINGS ARE POSTPONED. TRIALS BEING SLOW THANKS TO CORONAVIRUS. ALSO JUST WHY IT RIGHT NOW ROTAVIRUS HAS FORCED THE POSTPONEMENT OF. HEARINGS RILES. TO BEGIN WITH MY DAD FELL. SO MR- YOUNG IF YOU EVER FIGURE OUT THE TECHNOLOGY MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE IT WITH US. WELL THIS IS. YEAH BOB. YEAH WE CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE THRILLING- AND THEN EMAIL AND- AGAIN IF SOMEONE ENABLE MY SHARE BUT NINETY CHAIRED BY LIKE THAT I THINK THEY DISABLED IT FOR THIS TYPE OF PRESENTATION MODE WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE LINK FOR IT AND I'M SORRY YOU COULDN'T SEE IT NOW I CAN ACTED OUT BUT THEY DO IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN I WOULD THANK YOU AND IF YOU YEAH WE AND THEN WE CAN ALSO PUT UP ON OUR WEBSITE TO MAKE IT SURE THAT IT'S PART OF OUR PACKAGE WOULD BE HAPPY OKAY. SO DID DID YOU HAVE MORE TO PRESENT TO US. NO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER IT TAKES CREATIVE OUT OF THE BOX THINKING. AND WITH US WORKING TOGETHER WITH- EVEN REACHING OUT TO OUR- BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS THE AISLE. I BELIEVE IN THIS PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC WE CAN WORK. TO ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG OF CASES IN VERY CREATIVE WAYS. AND VOLUNTEER FOR A LOT OF. DISCOVERY REFEREE MEDIATING AND DOING A LOT OF THINGS AND WE'RE EAGER AND WILLING TO DO THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO SHARE SOME OF OUR IDEAS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS BECAUSE- WE HAVE THE WILL AND THE ABILITY. GREAT THANK YOU. CENTURY TRIALS ARE CANCELED IN PERSON HEARINGS ARE POSTPONED CAN YOU. WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS VIDEO LATER. THANK YOU WE'LL WE'LL PUT UP WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I'M I HAVE A KIND OF FOLLOWING UP FOR A QUESTION FOR MR YOUNG AND JUDGE ANDERSON. AND THIS SORT OF A TOP LEVEL OVER ARCHING QUESTION THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ALTERNATELY GET TO AND BASED ON WHAT YOU EXPLAINED IT AND I HATE THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S COMMENTS. TO POINT BECAUSE WE STRUGGLE WITH. SETTING STATEWIDE STANDARDS IMPOSING THAT LOCALLY AND I AND I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE SOME CHALLENGES HERE. BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT YOU CAN KEEP THAT THE CULTURE THE NATURE OF YOUR FIFTY EIGHT INDIVIDUAL. COUNTIES THE COURTS FUNCTIONING BUT STILL BE ABLE TO SET STANDARDS SO THAT WE DON'T SEE DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE COUNTY TO COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND I THINK SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN SHOWS THAT THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT. CONSTRAINTS TO DIFFERENT RESOURCES AND- WHICH LEADS TO A REALLY DIFFERENT ABILITY TO ACCESS JUSTICE AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT IS TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THIS IS PHYSICAL SPACES. BUT I THINK WE ULTIMATELY NEED TO HAVE A PLAN AND ADD AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CAN GET TO SORT OF WHAT BASIC LEVELS OF ACCESS OR ACCEPTABLE OR WE SHOULD BE SHOOTING FOR. AND THEN HOW WE ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE COURT CAN MEET THAT STANDARD AND I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION COLLECT THAT DATA I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY WILLING. TO LOOK AT THAT AND ENSURE THAT WE BUILD. PROOF AGAINST. A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS WILL HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT GONNA CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE BUT BUILD SOME. BUILD A BETTER SENSE OF ACCESS AND CONTINUITY AMONG ALL OF THE COURTS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT. WELL I CAN GO AHEAD AND- START WITH THAT ANYTHING- THE WAY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS STRUCTURED IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS STRUCTURED REALLY LENDS ITSELF. TO OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH YOU KNOW AS WELL AS REACHING OUT PARTNERING OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND LET ME. GIVE AN EXAMPLE WE ARE GRASSROOTS TO THE TOP AND GRASSROOTS TO THE TOP MEANS WE HAVE ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND ONCE WE HAVE ADVISORY COMMITTEES THAT TO THE BATTLE IN THE INFORMATION GATHERING THE DATA GATHERING AND THEY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION ON UP THE CHAIN- TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR POLICIES THAT. WE HAVE THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND WE HAVE THE COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS BEGINNING TO STUDY AND COLLECT DATA AS MISTER- YOUNG HAD I TALKED ABOUT THE SURVEY THAT WE DID WITH RESPECT TO THE COURTS. THEY PUT OUT THE PANDEMIC CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDES THAT IS THE PRESIDING JUDGE IS GETTING TOGETHER OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS AND SHARING INFORMATION AND SHARING BEST PRACTICES- SO THAT'S HOW IT IS DONE I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR. US IN TERMS OF OUR EVOLUTION HERE IN MONTEREY COUNTY WE FIRST STARTED OUT WITH MICROSOFT TEAMS AND THEN. GRADUATED TO A DIFFERENT PLATFORM AND FINALLY WE HAVE RESOLVED UNIFORMITY OUT WITH THE SUIT AND. THAT WAS AN EVOLUTION BY. WHEN THEY'RE AT THE BEACH. OF THE PAN. WHEN ALL YOU HAD TO DO DO SOME. AND THEN AS WE- TECHNOLOGY. PLATFORMS OUT REACHED OUT TO OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS REACHED OUT TO THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS TO FIND OUT WHAT. I WORK FOR THEM AS WELL AS HOW THAT INFORMED OUR DECISIONS AND WE BEGAN TO CHANGE OUR DECISIONS. SAME WORK BRANCH WIDE BY UTILIZING THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND GATHERING DATA AND INFORMATION AND SHARING THAT DATA AND INFORMATION THEN YOU CAN COME UP WITH A GOOD POLICY. AND PRODUCE AND PROVIDE MANUALS FOR FOLKS TO HAVE SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT SAYS WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES. WE ALSO HAVE THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT DOES A DATA COLLECTION AND ASSESSING ON TECHNOLOGY THAT INFORMS THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE. SO WE HAVE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ADVISORY BODIES COMMITTEES WORK GROUPS THAT REALLY DO THE VETTING AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. SO THAT DECISION MAKING AND BEST PRACTICES. CAN BE PROVIDED. ROSS THE BRANCH BUT ALSO FROM COURT TO MAKE OWN IN. DECISIONS BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY FIND THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR PARTICULAR COUNTY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE MISTER YOUNG- YOUNG HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO PROVIDE. YEAH I THINK THAT- IS IT IS A GOOD SUMMARY THINKING THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE REALLY IS AND TERMS OF WHAT THE- CHIEF JUSTICE WAS SAYING IN TERMS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF. ACTUALLY HAVING JURORS COME IN BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TO COME IN THE TO THE COURT- AND THAT'S ALSO A YOU KNOW A BARRIER- IN TERMS OF. YES SLOWING DOWN THE PROCESSES BUT I THINK THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT- AND AGAIN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE- I THINK SHOULD. SHOULD BE HELPFUL WELL WE DO ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO. SEEING BEYOND THE- FROM- IS- CHIANG- YOU KNOW IN WORKING WITH TECHNOLOGY EVERY DAY NOW WE SEE THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY- THOSE CAN GET RESOLVED SO THAT WE CAN SEE THAT THAT VIDEO. OKAY AND YOU'RE DESCRIBING. AS WITH INJURED COUNTS AND COURT. HOW ARE YOU TAKING INFORMATION FROM THE USERS OF THE COURTS. TO INFORM THOSE DECISIONS. YES SO- IN MANY CASES- FOR EXAMPLE AND SELF HELP- WE DO COLLECT THAT DATA ON A REGULAR BASIS- TO DETERMINE. WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST DEMAND SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS RESOURCES IN THOSE AREAS- WE HAVE MEANT AS WELL- WITH MANY OF THE GROUPS SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT TIME YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM TODAY AS WELL- TO GET THEIR INPUT AND INCORPORATE THAT. INTO OUR PLANS FOR RECOVERY AND IN FACT- IN THE PANDEMIC CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDE- THAT JUDGE ANDERSON MENTIONED HOW WE HAVE INCORPORATED- FEEDBACK FAST WE HAVE RECEIVED. IN THOSE BEST PRACTICES. THANK YOU CHERUB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST COUPLE QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASK THEM COLLECTIVELY AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND- TO ALL OF THEM FIRST IN TERMS OF THE INTERSECTION OF CRIMINAL TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO END CIVIL TRIALS. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CRIMINAL TRIALS AND HOW IS IT IMPACTING CIVIL TRIALS THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO. IS THAT. FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT THERE'S BOUNDARIES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL THINK IF YOU'RE IN A COUNTY. THAT COULD BRING SOME OF THE TRIAL IN TWO YEARS AND YOUR FIVE MILES FROM OTHER COUNTY THEY CAN'T BRING ANYTHING A TRIAL IN FIVE YEARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE A DISPARITY THERE WITHOUT WITHOUT A REAL RATIONALE AND SO WHAT WHAT WHAT THE COURTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO FOR EXAMPLE UP MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE IS A LEGISLATURE ENACT. A STATUTES SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY YOU CAN HAVE TRIALS THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES NUMBER ONE AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO. TO SURGE CAPACITY RIGHT NOW- THE FIVE YEAR OLD THE DREADED FIVE YEAR RULE IT IS COMING BACK IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT EVERY CASE GOING OUT TO TRIAL WAS A FOUGHT WHAT'S CALLED A FIVE YEAR CASE. NOW IT'S BACK. SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND IN THE U. S. COLLECTIVE WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE DO HERE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF ALL THESE CASES HITTING A FIVE YEAR PERIOD I GET THAT THERE'S AN EXTRA SIX MONTHS AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY ORDER. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION ESPECIALLY. WHEN THE ISSUE. IT'S NOT RESOLVED BUT WHEN THE- EVICTION- CHALLENGE BECOMES EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED SO. GO AHEAD SOLVE ALL THOSE QUESTIONS SOLVE ALL THOSE ISSUES THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S CONTINUING TO THE DIALOGUE AND DATA COLLECTION AND ASSESSING WHAT THE NEEDS ARE UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION OFTENTIMES. IT MAY BE DEPENDENT AGAIN LIKE I SAID ON ON PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF THE COURTS TO REALLY PROCESS ALL THOSE CASES ARE YOU ABLE TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE BUILDING DO YOU HAVE THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JURY TRIAL DO YOU HAVE THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE JURORS AND COMPLEMENT. BY YOU KNOW HAVING HALL IN SAFETY MONITORS WHEN HAVE WE EVER HAD TO HAVE SAFETY MONITORS OF THE WHOLE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THERE'S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE THE COURTROOM SO I THINK B. R. FIFTY EIGHT COURTS THROUGH THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACCORD EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMMITTEE. I CAN CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS I BELIEVE THE- THERE'S ALREADY THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY OPTS FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THE CHIEF JUSTICE. TO BE ABLE TO ASSIGN CERTAIN CASES TO TWO DIFFERENT CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT I THINK THERE ARE ANSWERS ANSWERS OUT THERE WHICH REQUIRE STUDY AND DATA ANALYSIS AND FURTHER CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE- AGAIN. I CAN TELL JUST TELL YOU I'M JUST SO FORTUNATE TO BE IN A COUNTY WITH WE WRE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ALL ELECTRONIC AND YOU COURT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WELL MY NEIGHBOR IN SANTA CRUZ IS NOT A COMPLETE IN COURT- AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW FOR VARIETY OF REASONS COULD BE BUDGET AT. IN ABILITY TO HIRE THAT REQUISITE TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND SO THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. WITH IN EACH COURT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU PARTICULARLY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR CASES DEAL WITH YOUR BACK LOADS AT A CASE ABOUT CLOTHES AND THEN ONCE WE'VE GATHER DATA AND DO THE ANALYSIS THEN WE. CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION BUT SOME TIMES WHEN YOU PUT THE CAR IN FRONT OF HORSE. AND THE COURT IS PUSHED THE CART OUT WE DON'T GET VERY FAR BUT I. IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET. TO ON CONTINUE TO SHARE INFORMATION THEN WE CAN COME UP WITH ANSWERS. JUDGE LANCE WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THAT. BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF CIVIL CASES IN PARTICULAR. SO WHAT WHAT'S THE TIMELINE. FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO US TO HELP RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. WE ARE STILL COLLECTING DATA I BELIEVE WE JUST COLLECTED ADDITIONAL DATA THAT I BELIEVE MISTER YOUNG INCLUDED IN HIS COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO- QUESTIONNAIRES. THAT WERE SENT OUT TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS- SO WE WOULD NEED TO COLLECT BECAUSE I CAN AGAIN TELL YOU DIFFERENT COURTS HAVE DIFFERENT TIMELINES FOR HEARING MONTEREY IF YOU WANT A TRIAL DATE YOU GET ONE. FOR CIVIL- AND THERE ARE AT BUT IN OTHER COUNTIES AND I THINK I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE EQUAL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FORTUNATE ENOUGH IN TERMS OF FACILITIES. TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT CRIMINAL AND CIVIL WAR OTHER PORTS DON'T HAVE THAT SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND ASSESS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR BACK LOADS. ARE THE RESOURCES JUDICIAL BECAUSE THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE OTHER RESOURCE THE STATS BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE. ARE THE RESOURCES FACILITIES BECAUSE IT MAY MAY NOT BE ARE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TECHNOLOGY WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEEDED IN ORDER UNDER YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO GET THE CASE OUT. YES THE BRANCH HAS IT ON THEIR MIND AT THAT TROUBLE JUST BY YOUR COMMITTEE AS WELL AS FOR EXECUTIVES. ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND THINKING DOWN THE ROAD JUST SAY HEY YOU. SEE THAT. SOMEONE AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE ACT YOU KNOW UNLAWFUL DETAINERS WILL COME TO THE COURTS WHAT IS OUR PLAN- WHAT RESOURCES ARE WE GONNA HAVE WHAT JUDICIAL OFFICERS ARE YOU GOING TO SIGN TO THAT EACH COURT WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO CONTINUALLY LOOK DOWN THE ROAD TO SAY HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS AND HOW DO WE SLOWLY BUT SURELY. WITHIN STATE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS THAT WE DO HAVE BEGIN TO WIDEN THE PIPELINE BEGIN TO OPEN UP AND BEGIN TO HEAR MORE AND MORE CASES. WE YEAH THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS WHO ARE TRYING NOT ONLY CRIMINAL CASES BUT SEVERAL CASES- THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW THAT DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES AND THEN OUR I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ALAMEDA. A LITTLE BIT LATER AND HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD I- REMOTE. JURY TRIALS SO AS COLLECT THE BEST. I THINK WE WILL BE ALSO. SALUTE SO MISTER. YOUNG WHAT WHAT IS THE TIME OF. FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP DEAL WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT ON CLOUT NINE. AND ON. THAT WILL- AFFECT ALL OF US. THREE WELL WE'RE HOPING THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ONSLAUGHT AND WHAT AS JUDGE ANDERSON HAD MENTIONED- WE ARE CONTINUALLY COLLECTING DATA- WHAT WE ARE DOING AT THIS POINT IN HIS EACH STEP TOWARDS RESTORATION FOR EXAMPLE OF THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED RESTORATION OUR BUDGET I THINK IS ONE STEP TOWARDS MOVING FORWARD- FOR US AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL HOW WE'RE IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS WHERE WE ANTICIPATE- EIGHT- JOHN IN OUR CASE LOAD AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING IN ON SOME OF THOSE- THE CHEESE HAS PUT TOGETHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE- EARLY DISPOSITION CALENDARS AND SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT A SET OF MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS- AND AS WE DETERMINE- WHAT WE CAN AND DEAL WITH INTERNALLY- WE WILL WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU TO DEFINITELY REACH OUT AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF RESTORATION OF THE- BUDGET I THINK IS A VERY STRONG MOVEMENT- TOWARDS- BEING- NORMALCY- BUT TO BE FRANK WELL ONE OF THE BIG CONSTRAINTS FOR US AGAIN IS NEED PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS- DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW ARE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE DEPENDENT UPON THINGS LIKE VACCINES AND OTHER- OTHER SOLUTIONS BUT- AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK THROUGH THE DATA AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COURTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH YOU AS WELL SO IT IS THE RIGHT TIME LINE FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND THEN PROVIDING US. WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW WE DO NOT HAVE A TIMELINE A IT'S GO TO BE AN ONGOING BASIS ONCE WE COLLECT- APPROPRIATE DATA AND WERE I'M READY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION- I THINK THAT WHEN WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD CONCLUSIONS WE WILL INITIATE THAT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE A SET TIME. FOR WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE WE WILL HAVE THAT ANALYSIS DONE OR COME TO CONCLUSIONS BUT IT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE IT BY THE TIME WE ENACT THE BUDGET. IT'S HARD TO SAY I AGAIN IT'S A ONGOING PROCESS. OKAY. OKAY JUST JUST DON'T YES I CENTER ALSO THE DOING THING I DO WANT TO GET ON TO OUROTHER PANELS I'M SORRY I JUST I IT'S HARD FOR ME WHEN YOU SAY. YOU DON'T SEE AN- WHEN. WE WILL FOR MORE RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS SEE IT. COMING AND WHETHER IT'S ON THE BIG XIN LEVEL. WHETHER IT'S IN THE DEPENDENCY COURTS I MEAN THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS ALL THE OTHER CIVIL CASES. THIS IS REALLY BUILDING UP AND THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR BACK THAT'S WHAT I HEAR BACK IN MY DISTRICT. SO I AM NOT I DON'T THINK I'M ASKING FOR YOU TO GIVE US A- DETAILED WHAT IS EVERY SINGLE COURT GOING TO DO IS. BUT RATHER. HOW AS A SYSTEM. AS A SYSTEM ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS. BOTH THE BACKLOG CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC WHICH WAS NOT ARE OF OUR MAKING. AS WELL AS- WHAT WAS ALREADY A BACKLOG IN THESE VARIOUS AREAS SO. YOU MAY NOT HAVE AN ANSWER NOW BUT- I DON'T SEE HOW WELLS. WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE'RE OFFERING YOU ARE ASKING YOU WHAT IS THE FUNDING THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO SOLVE ALL THIS. AND I'M JUST HERE I'M NOT QUITE HEARING THAT. THAT PROCESS IS I'M NOT SAYING I'M GOING TO PROCESS BUT THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO LEAD US TO A PLAN SOMEWHERE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I THINK WE'RE GOING TO. MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT PANEL BUT THAT THAT POINT IS WELL TAKEN AND SO TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I KNOW YOU WANT FULL RESTORATION THAT'S BEEN BEEN ONGOING SUBJECT HOWEVER. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE LEVELS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. IS AVAILABLE AND IT IS AVAILABLE AT. LEAST THE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ESTABLISHED ALREADY FROM THIS IS THERE ARE DISPARATE. LEVELS OF ACCESS COUNTY BY COUNTY BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE WANT TO HELP BUT WE NEED INFORMATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HELP SO HELP US THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS HELP US THROUGH. INFORMATION GATHERING PROCESSES IN THE MORE THAT WE CAN FEEL INFORMED THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNERS. IN COURT FUNDING AND GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEASURES UP TO OUR PROCESSES AND THAT THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS AFFECTING THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE QUESTION. ALL RIGHT SO LET'S NOW MOVES TO THE PANEL TWO AND WE'RE- A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BUT THAT'S OKAY. SO WE HAVE FIRST OF ALL IT'S ENERGY RICHARDSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BAY AREA LEGAL AID. AND WE HAVE A SHELL BROWN CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION THE FAMILY LAW SECTION. AND CATHERINE STEPHAN- SEVEN OR SO STATES WHO IS A PRACTICING ELDER ABUSE ATTORNEY. AND THE SUBJECT OF THIS PANEL IS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC OWN SOME COURT USERS SO THESE ARE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT VERY SPECIFIC AREAS. WHERE THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED THEIR PRACTICE AND THEIR CLIENTS SO MS RICHARDSON. I'M GENEVIEVE PROJECT SETTINGS EXTRACTOR VERY LEGAL LANA- BENEGAL IS A REGIONAL CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES NONPROFIT THAT CERTAIN PRACTICES IN THE SEVEN BAY AREA COUNTY. WE SERVE AND REPRESENT VERY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND A VARIETY OF FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL RIGHTS ISSUES HOUSING MYSTIC VIOLENCE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND MORE. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE IN LEGAL AID FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND I THINK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING- AND FOCUSING ON WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SUPPORT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO BE SAFE. AND TO ENSURE FULL AND EQUAL ACCESS THE TWO CANNOT BE SEPARATED. WE CANNOT BE HAVE LITIGANTS AND ATTORNEYS CHOOSING BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH AND THE EXERCISE IN PROTECTION OF LEGAL RIGHTS TO TAKE EARLY LEAD AGAINST WITH LIMITED MEANS AND OFTEN THOSE WHO ARE THE GREATEST HEALTH THREATS. AND YET THIS CONTINUES TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT AS CHAIR. I LEGAL AID WE ARE. TO ADDRESSING POVERTY SOCIAL INJUSTICE AND ACCESS TO THE COURTS IN ON PANDEMIC HAPPENS WE DO THIS BY OUR OPEN DOORS. AND OUR ATTORNEYS ADVOCATES ARE YOU MEETING WITH OUR CLIENTS THE COMMUNITY BUT IN MARCH FOLLOWING THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORIES EVEN APPARENT ESSENTIAL SERVICE. WE MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE OUR DOORS AND- TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS STAFF AND COMMUNITIES WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING FOCUSED ON SAFETY AND THEN WE CONTINUED OUR SERVICES REMOTELY. WITH VERY LIMITED IN PERSON ACTIVITIES AND REALLY STRICT- SAFETY PROTOCOLS IT HASN'T BEEN PERFECT OR IDEAL BUT IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY. AND SINCE THE BEGINNING WE'VE ALSO BEEN RAISING SAFETY AND ACCESS ISSUES AND THE COURTS ARE LOCAL COURTS AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL. HONEST STATEWIDE LEVEL AS ONE OF ELEVEN LSC FUNDED LEGAL SERVICE SAYS TOGETHER WE SERVE THE COMMUNITIES IN EVERY COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE. AND IN OUR FREQUENT MEETINGS THROUGHOUT KOBE WE START IDENTIFYING THESE SYSTEMIC PATTERNS OF DISPARITIES THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IN SEPTEMBER WITH SUCH A DETAILED LETTER TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WITH THE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ADDRESS THEM. WE'VE LOST WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. RAISING ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ON THE NEED FOR STATEWIDE GUIDELINES AND MINIMUM STANDARDS. WE ALL KNOW THAT HOGAN NINETEEN S. EXPOSE GREAT DISPARITIES THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY INCLUDING AT THE COURTS AND UNIQUE HEALTH DANGERS WITHIN THE COURTS. MY FOCUS TODAY IS ON WHAT CONTINUES TO BE CENTRAL TO BE LEGAL AND IT TOO MANY GREAT COLLEAGUES. RT AND WORKS AND THAT IS THAT OUR LOW INCOME LITIGANTS AND OUR STAFF ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO UNNECESSARY HEALTH RISKS IN REQUIRED IN PERSON PROCEEDINGS. AND THERE IS GREAT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS WE NEED A MINIMUM STANDARD. I LINES WHERE THE COURTS AND SAFETY AND WE NEED TO LINE THE IS WITH A CALIFORNIA COMPANY GUIDELINES AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED BY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WELL MOST OF CALIFORNIA IS IN THE STRICTEST PURPLE TEAR WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MATTERS THAT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO BE IN PERSON IN UNSAFE COURTROOMS. MANY OF THE IN PERSON REQUIREMENTS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS LOW INCOME. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE IN PERSON HEARINGS ON THE WAY FOR. A TRAFFIC CITATION AND AFFECTION. EVICTION MATTERS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING SEPARATE JURY TRIALS AND SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE AS THESE REQUIRE- MORE LONG HOURS INDOORS WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT ALL OF IT CONTRADICTS YOUR BASICS CDC GUIDELINES AND- CREATES EXTREME DANGERS ARE CODED TRANSMISSION WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES OF TRIALS A SUPER SPREADERS. AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE RARE REFERENCE WE'VE SEEN EXPOSURE AFTER EXPOSURE IN THIS CONTEXT. WE ALSO ROUTINELY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HEALTH COMPROMSE NEEDING REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. AND OFTEN THEY ARE WAITING FOR RULINGS ON THEIR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS UP UNTIL JUST BEFORE HEARINGS OR IF THEY'RE NOT ANSWERED THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH AND EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS WERE THE ATTORNEYS ETHICAL DUTIES. WELL THERE'S NOTHING PERFECT IT IN NO PERFECT SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED WE ARE REALLY FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE REMOTE SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE US TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ARTS. THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT MINIMUM STANDARDS AND HOW WE GET ALL COURTS CONSISTENT I THINK ARE EXACTLY ON POINT IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ACCESS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP TO ESTABLISH STATEWIDE SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR REPORTS. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WHEN WE MEET WITH LOCAL COURTS THE LOCAL COURTS ARE OFTEN LOOKING TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WELL IT'S NOT THAT'S JUST A COUNCIL THEY ARE OFTEN DEFERRING TO LOCAL COURTS OR THEY DON'T WANT TO OVERSTEP THE LEGISLATURE. THUS THIS IS LEFT LEAD AGAINST AN ADVOCATES A CORPORATE HOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT MATCH OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. I COME OUT I ALSO COMMEND THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND ALL THAT WAS IN IT AS IT JUST CRIED THE RULES ESTABLISHED BY LOCAL PORTS ARE NOT. OUR SYSTEM. IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE IS LOCKED BIG WHITE STANDARDS HASN'T MET. MENTION CREATE INCONSISTENCIES AND DISPARITIES INCREASED HEALTH RISKS AND INCREASED CORE ACCESS. WE RECOGNIZE LOCAL COURTS AND DIGITAL I ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD- AND WE UNDERSTAND THERE UNDER RESOURCE AND THAT THERE ARE LOCAL CONSTRAINTS INDIANS BUT OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LOCAL COURTS AND JUDGES SEEM TO BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH RECREATING AND REACTING RATHER THAN STARTING FROM MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES AND I'M STANDARDS FOR. REMOTE TECHNOLOGIES AND BASIC TEMPLATES FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND NOTICES AND INSTRUCTIONS. THE RESULT OF WHAT WE SEE IS THAT ONE'S ABILITY TO SAFELY EXERCISE THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS IS NOT JUST BY COUNTY BUT LIKE COURT DEPARTMENT AND BY JUDICIAL OFFICER. EXAMPLE WE CONTINUE TO SEE A LOT OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED CONSISTENT POLICIES FOR ACCESS REMOTE APPEARANCES AS YOU OF DISCUSSED. THERE IT MAY BE THAT WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS TO APPEAR IN PERSON MIGHT BE ABLE TO CALL IN OR USE VIDEO PARENTS MAY DEPEND JUST ON A JUDICIAL OFFICERS PREFERENCE AN INTEREST IN LEARNING THE TECHNOLOGY. RATHER THAN WHITE RIGHT TRAINING AND FACILITATION OF REMOTE ACCESS. WE DO NOT SEE CONSISTENT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS EVEN ACROSS LOCAL COURTS. I'M AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR THINGS LIKE LANGUAGE ACCESS. WE HAVE WE ARE NOT SEEING SIMPLE CLEAR NOTICES AND INSTRUCTIONS SO IT IS CONFUSING TO KNOW HOW- WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AND HOW YOU ACCESS THEM. AND THEY ARE OFTEN NOT THAT TRANSLATED INTO LANGUAGES OUT OTHER THAN ENGLISH MAKING IT EITHER. FOR MORE COMPLICATED. FOR LEAD AGAINST YOU DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AS FIRST LANGUAGE. OUR CLIENTS ALSO THOSE ARE FACING FEES RELATED RELATED TO RURAL REMOTE ACCESS AND FEE WAIVERS ARE NOT BEING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. FOR EXAMPLE FOR A TELEPHONIC APPEARANCE WITH COURT CALL IT CAN BE A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CALL OR PER CALL THERE ARE OFTEN MANY STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO GET THOSE FEES WAIVED. FOR THOSE WERE JUST ABOVE A FEE WAIVER WHICH RAISED A FAMILY OF FOUR I JUST UNDER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS COULD BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OR FOR JUST A FEW HEARINGS WHICH INCLUDE CONTINUANCE. WHILE OTHER COMPANIES AND JUST ACROSS THAT ARTIFICIAL BOUNDARY. YET THERE ARE NO FEES FOR REMOTE ACCESS. FURTHER THIS INCONSISTENCY AND REMOTE APPEARANCE THIS HAS MEANT THAT THERE ARE LESS RESOURCES FOR LEGAL AID IN PRO BONO AS OFTEN WE ARE ETHICALLY WE HAVE ATTORNEYS THAT ARE ETHICALLY I HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION AND ASSISTANCE BECAUSE HER HEALTH CONCERNS THEY CANNOT GO INTO COURT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS CAN CHANGE AND CHANGE QUICKLY WE CAN WE SEE AND HOW MANY IS AND WE WILL HEAR FROM LATER TODAY ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED CONSISTENT UNIVERSAL VIDEO PARENTS TECHNOLOGIES STARTING IN APRIL. AND THEY ARE A MODEL FOR BEST PRACTICES. AS IN THE- ALSO AS WELL AS DETAILED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. ALL MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HAVE DONE SOME A REMOTE APPEARANCES FIFTY COUNTIES HAVE SOME LEVEL OF REMOTE ACCESS AND THIRTY EIGHT HAVE SOME WITHIN EACH. CASE TYPE SO THERE IS ALREADY GROUNDWORK THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE AVAILABILITY STATEWIDE AND THAT IS CRITICAL WE NEED THAT CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. IN CONCLUSION I JUST I WANT TO AGAIN RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BUT WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN THE MIDST OF THIS. MATCH AND THERE IS GREAT URGENCY AND NEED TO ACT NOW. I UNDERSTAND WE THE WE HAVE YEARS TO COME BUT AGAIN WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP ESTABLISH STATEWIDE COURTS SAFETY GUIDELINES THAT A LONG. ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA CODE GUIDELINES SUCH OF OUR HOLDERS TIERED SYSTEM THAT IS WELL KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD IT. AND TO HELP SET SAFETY GUIDELINES THAT ARE LED BY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE EXPANSION OF REMOTE ACCESS AND HAVE A COMMITMENT TO CONSISTENCY AND FULL EQUAL. AND ACCESS. FOR ALL LITIGANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS WILL RICK. A COMMITMENT FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING WHICH I'M HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK THIS TIMELINE IS URGENT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FINANCIAL BARRIERS ARE NOT IN THE WAY OF SAFETY AND ACCESS. IT WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT IN DISASTER RELIEF DOES NOT DIVERT FROM OTHER VITAL SERVICES. AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE LESSONS WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES. LEGAL AID REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COURTS AND THE LEGISLATURE IN DRESS ACCESS TO JUSTICE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH OUR- THANK YOU LET'S MOVE TO MICHELLE BROWN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MICHELLE BROWN AND I'M THE FAMILY LAW REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION I'M A CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST AND HAVE BEEN AND PRACTICED BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO START CHIEF JUSTICE SAID FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND I PRACTICED PRIMARILY IN SAN DIEGO MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS REGARDING FAMILY LAW AND THE EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON THE LITIGANTS AND THE COURT AND THE INFORMATION THAT I'M PROVIDING TO YOU YOU IS BASED ON INFORMATION FROM MY FAMILY LAW COLLEGE ACROSS THE STATE L. AS WELL AS THE FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS THEMSELVES. INTO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 90% OF FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE SELF REPRESENTED WE MUST CONSIDER THE EFFECT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. WHEN THE PANDEMIC INITIALLY HIT IT RESULTED IN ABSOLUTE CHAOS FOR FAMILY ALREADY GETS PARTICULARLY THOSE IN CHILD CUSTODY SITUATIONS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU HANDLE A TWO PARENT HOME WHICH ULTRA HOME ORDERS WHAT DO I DO IF I'VE LOST MY JOB AND I CAN'T PAY SUPPORT. HOW DO I GET A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER WITH THE ESCALATION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. BUT THROUGH THE COURTS STAKEHOLDERS JUDICIAL COUNCILS WE'VE WORKED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE ARE ABLE TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE CHAOS PROVIDE DIRECTIONS TO FAMILIES WHO ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. WE'VE ACTUALLY RESULTED IN SOME POSITIVE THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BE TAKEN INTO FAMILY COURT ARE NOW INTO THE FUTURE. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT KAMALA LITIGANTS HAVE. HAD THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC SOME OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS AND A WAY FORWARD. ONE OF THE IMPORT CONSEQUENCES OF THE PANDEMIC HAS AN ESCALATION IN THE AMOUNT OF DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FILINGS AND IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FILINGS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS STATED IN ITS REPORT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT JUST BETWEEN MARCH AND JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS A 59% INCREASE IN ASSISTANCE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A 57% INCREASE IN ASSISTANCE FOR CHILD CUSTODY ISSUES. SO WITH THE MESSAGE VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC ABUSE ON THE RISE. THE REQUEST FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT RESTRAINING ORDERS ESCALATED. HOWEVER MOST OF THE COURTS TO GRAB THE STATE EVEN WHEN THE COURTS WERE COMPLETELY CLOSED PROVIDED A MECHANISM PROTECTED THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS AND GUN VIOLENCE TO BRING RESTRAINING ORDERS. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY EACH COURT HAD AN EX PARTE INFORMATION BOOTH WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO DROP OFF YOUR APPLICATION FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER AND THERE IS ONE JUDICIAL OFFICERS WHO WOULD REVIEW THE REQUEST AND EITHER GRANTS IT OR DENY IT IN CAMERA WITHOUT THE HEARING. ALTHOUGH THE COURTS ACROSS THE STATE REALLY DID A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING ON THEIR WEBSITES INFORMATION AS TO HOW TO SEEK A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER DURING THE PANDEMIC. WAS UP THE DIFFICULT FOR ATTORNEYS LET ALONE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. YES OUR ROLES HAD TO KNOW TO GO ON TO THE COURT WEBSITE TO FIND HOW TO GO TO CODE RELIEF AND HOW TO SEEK A RESTRAINING ORDER. MANY OF THE SELF HELP CENTERS WERE CLOSED INITIALLY AND THEN ONLY REMOTE SO THOSE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS EVEN THOUGH THE COURTS DID A GOOD JOB OF ENSURING. THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE FOR VICTIMS OF ABUSE. A DV EIGHT ZERO. MUST BE HEARD OR DISSOLVED WITHIN TWENTY FIVE DAYS AS THE STATUTE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENACTED EMERGENCY ROLE EIGHT WHICH ALLOW THE EXTENSION OF THE EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS. IS GREATLY ASSISTED THE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNFORTUNATELY MANY VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT RULE EIGHT WAS LOOKING KNOW WHETHER. THE RESTRAINING ORDER HAD BEEN TERMINATED OR WERE STILL IN EFFECT. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN AT PARENT MAY ALSO INCLUDE AN APPLICATION FOR A G. D. G. RO. I REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY OR VISITATION OF THE CHILD. NO CONTACT OR SUPERVISED VISITATION. WELL WHAT THE SHOP AT HOME ORDERS. COURTS CLOSED MANY SUPERVISED VISITATION MONITORS WERE NO LONGER DOING SUPERVISION SUPERVISED VISITATION AND- LOCATIONS WERE CLOSED THIS ENDED UP RESULTING IN NO CONTACT ORDERS AND NO VISITATION ORDERS. ARE PERSONS WHO WERE RESTRAINED OR FOR PERSONS WHO ACTUALLY CURRENTLY HAD A SUPERVISED VISITATION ORDER. AND OFTEN TOOK FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS FOR THESE PERMANENT RESTRAINING ORDERS TO BE HEARD AND DURING THAT TIME THE RESTRAINT QUALITIES OFTEN HAD NO ACCESS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. SO ONE OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS. WAS HOW TO SHARE YOUR CHILDREN AND IT TO HOME FAMILY WITH A SHELTER HOME ORDER. THE REMAINDER FOR YET A QUESTIONS THAT SUB REPRESENT AGAINST THAT WERE ATTORNEYS WERE DISCUSSING AMONG THEMSELVES WE HAD NO ABILITY TO SEEK COURT GUIDANCE. SINCE MOST OF THE SCHOOLS WERE INITIALLY CLOSED DO YOU FOLLOW YOUR COURT ORDERED CUSTODY PLAN WHILE THE CHILDREN ARE IN SCHOOL DO YOU FELT COURT ORDER CUSTODY PLAN. FOR SUMMER VACATION. WHAT DO YOU DO IF ONE PARENT HAS VISITATION WITH THE CHILD AND THE CHILD IS OUT OF STATE DO YOU ALLOW THAT CHILD TO FLY. FOR THE SHELTER AT HOME ORDERED. WHAT DO YOU DO IF ONE PARENT TEST POSITIVE FOR COBIT DO YOU ALLOW THE CHILD TO GO TO THE OTHER PARENT'S HOME WELL THESE ARE QUESTIONS. THAT NO ONE HAD DEALT WITH LAWYERS WERE ARGUING ABOUT HOW TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS SOUTHWEST REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WERE COMPLETELY IN THE DARK. WHAT DID THIS DO THIS RESULTED IN AN ESCALATION OF PHONE CALLS TO POLICE AN ESCALATION OF RESTRAINING ORDERS. GAME PLAYING. FORTUNATELY THE MANY OF THE COURTS DID ISSUE FAQS WHICH STATED THAT CUSTODY ORDER SHOULD BE ADHERED TO DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND IF THE PARENT WAS BOUND TO HAVE WRONGLY ABUSED THE SYSTEM DURING THE PANDEMIC THEN THAT CAN BE HELD AGAINST THEM AND A FUTURE MODIFICATION HEARING. BUT WITH THE BACKLOG OF CASES AND THE COURTS TRIAGING TO ENSURE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AND CASES WHERE THERE ARE NO COURT ORDERS THAT ALL WANT CUSTODY WERE HEARD. A MODIFICATION PROCEEDING WAS SIX TO NINE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD. THAT ALSO RESULTED IN ISSUES LIKE I SAID WERE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ORDERS MAYBE THE PARENTS SEPARATED DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT THERE WEREN'T DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS HOW DO YOU SHARE THE CHILDREN WHAT IF ONE CHILD. STRUCK THAT WHAT OF ONE PARENT REFUSES TO TURN THE CHILD OVER TO ANOTHER PARENT SEEKING SAFETY ISSUES THESE WERE ALL CONCERNS THAT WERE IMPACTING FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS WHICH WERE NOVEL ISSUES THAT FAMILY LAW ATTORNEYS HAD TO DEAL WITH. THE MASSIVE LOSS OF JOBS ACROSS THE STATE IMPACTED BOTH PLAYERS A SUPPORT AND RECIPIENTS OF SUPPORT. I HAD A PLETHORA WHICH CLIENTS CALLING ME WITH LOTS THEIR JOBS WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THERE IS NO WAY TO GET INTO COURT TO FILE A MODIFICATION FOR SUPPORT. DID THEY CONTINUE PAYING SUPPORT WHICH WOULD MEAN THEM HAVING TO CASH IN THEIR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS OR DID THEY STOP PAYING SUPPORT ALTOGETHER. HOW DID THAT AFFECT THE RECIPIENT OF THE SUPPORT WHO ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WENT FROM RECEIVING MONEY TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN TWO ZERO. FORTUNATELY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENACTED EMERGENCY ROLE THIRTEEN WHICH ALLOWED THE PARTIES TO SERVE MOTIONS FOR MODIFICATION ON SUPPORT EVEN WHEN THE COURTS WERE CLOSED. AND ALLOW THE COURTS TO GRANT RETROACTIVE MODIFICATION OF CHILD OR SPOUSAL SUPPORT HOWEVER IT WAS STILL TAKING MONTHS TO GET INTO THE COURT. WHEN THE COURTS BY THE RE OPEN FOR HEARINGS THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG BUT THE COURTS REALLY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF PREJUDGING AND HEARING ISSUES. LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR INITIAL CUSTODY ORDERS FIRST. IT DISCUSSING CUSTODY ISSUES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT ALSO CAME ABOUT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IS A CONCERN AS WE SIT HERE TODAY IS THE CHILD CUSTODY RECOMMENDING COUNCILLORS OR THE FCS FAMILY COURT SERVICES MEDIATORS. PREVIOUSLY. THE FAMILY COURT SERVICES MEDIATOR WOULD SET WITH BOTH PARENTS EITHER COLLECTIVELY OR INDEPENDENTLY FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION WAS OBTAINED THE FACTS AND BE ABLE TO WRITE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE JUDICIAL OFFICER ON A PARENTING PLAN. HOWEVER SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED MOST OF THESE FAMILY COURT SERVICES MEDIATIONS HAVE OCCURRED BY FALL. NOT ONE SES'S REPORTED BEING IN PERSON THIS IS RESULTING TO AN FCS COUNSELOR MAYBE HAVING A ONE HOUR PHONE CONVERSATION WITH FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ASSESS BODY LANGUAGE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCEPT THOSE COERCIVE CONTROL ISSUES AND PERHAPS AS IS UNFORTUNATELY COMMON IN FAMILY LAWSUIT SITUATIONS. TO PARENTS STILL RESIDING IN THE SAME HOME MAYBE IN DIFFERENT ROOMS ON THE PHONE WITH THE FAMILY COURT SERVICES COUNSELOR TRYING TO DECIDE. HOW TO PLAN THEIR PARENTING. ONE THING THAT WE WANT THE COURTS MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IT'S TWO PENDING A RETURN TO IN PERSON FAMILY COURT SERVICES SESSIONS ENSURING THAT ALL FAMILY COURT SERVICES SESSIONS ARE DONE VIA VIRTUAL VIDEO PLATFORM. THIS WAY THE COUNSELORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE PARENTS AND HOW THEY INTERACT. WITH EACH OTHER AND- LASTLY WHAT I WANTED TO A- WAS THE RIVER HEARINGS FAMILY LAW HAS ACTUALLY DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB OF ENSURING THAT ALL FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE HAVING ACCESS TO THE COURTS. THEY ARE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR SUBSTANTIVE HEARINGS HEARD NOT ONLY ARE WE HAVING REQUEST FOR ORDER HEARINGS FOR CUSTODY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD SUPPORT SPOUSAL SUPPORT. THERE ARE ALSO TRIALS THAT ARE OCCURRING ON PROPERTY DIVISION I WAS JUST IN AN ALMOST TWO WEEK TRIAL JUST LAST MONTH ON PROMOTE. AND THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH REMOTE ISSUES BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME BENEFITS THAT WE'VE SEEN. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ARE THAT LOW INCOME LITIGANTS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS LAPTOPS OR SMARTPHONES THEREFORE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT DIG UP YOUR BY PHONE. THIS PUTS THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE THE JUDGES CAN'T SEE THEM THEY CAN'T SEE THE JUDGE THEY CAN'T SEE THE OTHER PARTY. IF THERE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THE COURTS OFTEN HAVE TO CONTINUE HEARINGS THIS IS OFTEN DONE AS A PLOY OF ONE PARENT OR DOESN'T WANT A COURT HEARING TO GO FORWARD HERE SHE MAY FAILING TO HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. PRETEND THAT THEY CAN'T HEAR THE COURT AND THE MATTER GETS CONTINUE. SOME OF THE MORE JUST CONCERNING THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT YOU'RE IN A CHILD CUSTODY SITUATION. AND YOU'RE WITH THE CHILDREN WHO ARE AT HOME DISTANCE LEARNING. YOU CAN BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A COURT HEARING DISCUSSING WHO'S GONNA HAVE CUSTODY OF A CHILD AND THAT CHILD WALKS IN IN THE- PRECEDING. OR YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CUSTODY PROCEEDING AND A CHILD MAYBE HAS A TEMPER TANTRUM AND THE CORPS OFFICER IS HEARING A CHILD SCREAMING ARE POUNDING ON THE DOOR TO GET THEIR MOTHER OR FATHER'S ATTENTION. HOW IS THAT GOING TO AFFECT THE- COURT'S RULING ON PARENTING. AND HONESTLY SOME OF THE BENEFITS LASTLY SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE WANT TO SAY R. DESPITE THESE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES REMOTE HEARINGS HAVE PROVIDED MORE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR SOME SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS IT IS EXPENSIVE TO GO TO COURT YOU HAVE A CAR YOU GOTTA DRIVE TO COURT IT'S OFTEN THIRTY DOLLARS TO PAY FOR PARKING HAS TAKEN ENTIRE DAY OFF OF WORK SOMEONE WHO MAKES MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THEIR SALARY. HERE THEY COULD ASK FOR HALF A DAY OFF THE WORK SIT IN A ROOM AND MAYBE BE ABLE TO APPEAR FOR COURT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DECREASE CHILD CARE COSTS THEY DON'T HAVE GUESTS ALLEGE THEIR CHILD ALL DAY LONG IF YOU REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ATTORNEY FEES YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR YOUR LAWYER TO DRIVE TO AND FROM COURT. AND IF YOU HAVE. THE ABILITY THAT JUDGES HAVE DONE TO ENABLE A LADY GETS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE COURTS ON THE SPOT IT'S HELP DRAMATICALLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN A CHILD SUPPORT HEARING. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PAY STUB THE COURT CAN'T ISSUE AN ORDER REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT. THAT THAT PARENT IS AT HOME THE JUDGES I'VE SEEN JUDGES STEAK WELL CAN YOU EMAIL THE PASTE UP TO MY CLERK WELL LET'S PUT YOU ON RECALL. THE JUDGE CAN HEAR THE MATTER RIGHT THEN AND THERE INSTEAD OF HAVING THESE PARTIES HAVE TO COME BACK ON ANOTHER DAY. AND UNLIKE THE CIVIL TRIALS FAMILY LAW TRIALS OR BENCH TRIALS SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE TRIALS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. SO AS GOING FORWARD. WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER A HYBRID. PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE LET'S HAVE SOME OF THESE TRIALS OR CREDIBILITY IS AN ISSUE OR YOU WANT THE JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOMEONE ON CROSS EXAMINATION. WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT GOTCHA ON IMPEACHMENT. MAYBE THOSE ARE IN PERSON REQUEST FOR ORDER HEARINGS MAYBE THEY CAN STAY REMOTE LET'S LOOK AT HIGHBRIDGE. ALLOW ELECTRONIC FILING. THAT AND KEEP DROP BOXES FOR THOSE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS I MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY EIGHT I'M CONFIDENT THAT WITH US ALL WORKING TOGETHER THANK YOU THIS PANDEMIC THE FAMILY LAW SYSTEM IS GOING TO COME OUT STRONGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND LET'S GO TO OUR FINAL PANELIST ON THIS PANEL TO CATHERINE STEP. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CAPTAIN STEPHAN- AND I AM A VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS WITH GREAT HUMILITY AND GRATITUDE THAT I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I'M HERE TO DESCRIBE THE DEVASTATING WAYS IN WHICH CODE RELATED JUDICIARY DELAYS THAT IMPACTED MY ELDERLY CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS IS A BIT OF BACKGROUND I'M ALSO ON THE LEGAL REFERRAL SERVICES BOARD FOR THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM PAST PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO TRIAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND CO AUTHOR IN TWO OF THE CHAPTERS OF THE CV BOOK ON ELDER ABUSE LITIGATION. I FILED MY FIRST ELDER ABUSE IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NO I DON'T LOOK THAT OLD. WHAT IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND I THE PRACTICE TO DO THE MATH- MY FOR IS IN SERVICES WHERE FOR LAWYER WORK TIME I WOULD CASES- ALL THAT'S ALL I DO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE NOTICED SYSTEM AT THE VERY SHORT- PART OF THIS HEARING IS THAT NOBODY'S TALKED ABOUT ELDERS- AND NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN NEED TO BE PROTECTED BUT OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN MENTIONED BUT ELDERS ESPECIALLY ELDERS LIVING AND- NURSING HOMES AND YOU KNOW WITH SERIOUS INJURIES HAVE BEEN- NEGLECTED. YOU KNOW THEY AREN'T THEY REQUIRE. PRIORITY LIKE CHILDREN. AS I JUST KNOW JUST WANT TO SOME REFERRED ABOUT THE- TO FOCUS ON THE CHILDREN NOT THAT THAT'S ONE OF. BUT I THINK WE NEED. TO NOW AND WE ALL KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW BEING IN A NURSING HOME. IS POSSIBLY A DEATH SENTENCE. FOR A INJURED ALTER. I TELL PEOPLE THAT MY CLIENTS ARE EITHER USUALLY DEMENTED OR DEATH. WE BRING CASES AGAINST LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. IF MY CLIENT. IS ALIVE THEY'RE OLD. AND THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN THESE FACILITIES AND THE FINANCIAL ABUSE CASES THEY'VE BEEN SWINDLED OUT OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND HAVE NO CHANCE OF OTHER INCOME AND THEY HAVE HEALTH CONDITIONS TO ATTEND TO. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BOTH MY CASES AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. IN WAYS THAT TO SHOW HOW ELDERS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED DUE TO THEIR HEALTH STATUS AND THE COOK WITH PANDEMIC. MY CLIENTS DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME. THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AND UNIQUELY DISADVANTAGED BY THE WAY. WHAT I WANTED TO JUST GO THROUGH VERY SPECIFICALLY WITH YOU JUST SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT JUST THE SIMPLE HOLTZ NOT SIGNING OF AN ORDER DOES TO OUR CLIENTS AND ONE HAPPENS TO SIT ON A JUDGE DOES FOR FOUR MONTHS. SO FIRST CLIENT JAMES NONE. FILED AN ELDER ABUSE CASE AGAINST A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. HE WAS NINETY FOUR YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND TIME WAS OF THE ESSENCE. YEAH AMPUTATION IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AFTER HAVING A PRESSURE ULCER OR DECUBITUS ULCER AT THE FACILITY AND WE WERE GENERALLY CONCERNED WHETHER HE WOULD EVEN SURVIVE TO THE END OF THE CASE. WITHOUT THE CASE RIGHT AWAY RIGHT BEFORE THE COURT SHUT DOWN ON MARCH AND WHEN THEY RE OPEN WE NEED IT WE FILED A MOTION FOR PREFERENCE WELL IF MY CLIENTS ARE LIVING THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A TRIAL WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AFTER- THE MOTION IS HEARD SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PREFERENTIAL TRIALS FOR ELDERS ARE NEEDED. BECAUSE THEY'LL DIE IN ALL GO INTO THAT LATER. DUE TO THE COURT BACK. IT WAS SET FOR JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IT CAN THE COURT CONTINUED THE MOTION AND EVEN AFTER GRANTING OUR MOTION FOR PREFERENCE ON SEPTEMBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THE COURT DIDN'T GIVE US A TRIAL DATE. FOR THE QUOTE INSTEAD THE COURT SET A TRIAL SETTING CONFERENCE ON IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH. AT THAT HEARING THE COURT SAID IT COULD GIVE US A TRIAL WITHIN THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS FOR THE CODE. SO IT WAS SET FOR. A JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. MR NONE WAS LITERALLY DYING AND WE HAVE WE WERE FORCED TO SETTLE THE CASE. PRIOR TO HIS DAY IN COURT. IN FEDERAL VERSES CHASE WE HAVE A FINANCIAL ELDER ABUSE CASE ARISING FROM A SWEETHEART SCAM THE DRAIN ALL OF AN EIGHTY SEVEN YEAR OLD. OF LIFE SAVINGS FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT. IT WAS BROUGHT AGAINST CASE BANK. CHASE BANK ALLEGING THAT THROUGH HIS REPRESENTATIVES WE HAVE NOTICED THAT HE'S POTENTIALLY BEING SCAMMED AT THIS DID NOTHING ABOUT IT IGNORING ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT ADVISORIES THEY HAD DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE RED FLAGS AND THEY TOOK TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HIS ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS. HE MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR FUNDING FOR A PREFERENTIAL TRIAL SETTING. AND HE HAS NOTHING AND HE'S LIVING PRACTICALLY SWALLOW RIGHT NOW. THIS CASE WAS INITIALLY FILED IN SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX TWO THOUSAND AND- RIGHT BEFORE WE KNEW THE EXTENT OF CODE. THE CASE WAS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT BY CHASE IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. SUPERIOR COURT ALMOST FIVE MONTHS LATER IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. A HEARING YEAH YES WE GOT OKAY AND THEN- OKAY GREAT AND THEN SO IT WAS AND THEN THE COURT WAS SUPPOSED TO SEND IT SAN FRANCISCO SEND IT TO- RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND I WAS OVER TWO MONTHS AGO. WE'VE BEEN MAKING PHONE CALLS BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY TRYING TO LEAST EVEN GET A CASE NUMBER WE DON'T KNOW WHERE CASES AND MY STAFF AND WE HAVE BEEN MAKING NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS EVEN FIND OUT WHERE THIS CASE IS SO WE CAN'T EVEN ASK FOR PREFERENTIAL TRIAL SITTING WITH THIS MAN WAS EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS OLD WAS LOST ALL HIS MONEY. MISTER CUNNINGHAM ANOTHER CLIENT IS EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD HUSBAND OF A WOMAN WHO DIED AFTER DEVELOPING GANGRENE FROM ABOUT SORT OF THE DEVELOPED IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. WE FILED OUR COMPLAINT THE CASE DECEMBER NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE FILED A MOTION FOR PREFERENCE HEARING WHICH WAS SET MARCH SIX TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WAS RESET FOR APRIL TENTH. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. HEARING WAS THEN CONTINUED FOUR TIMES. BECAUSE OF CODE RELATED DAYS DELAYS AND ON OCTOBER NINTH THE MOTION WAS GRANTED AND IT WAS SET FOR A TRIAL ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. ON DECEMBER EIGHTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE COURT SO SPONTANEOUS VACATED THE TRIAL. VACATED THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE AND JUST TALK ABOUT COUNTER AND SAID COME SEE ME ON JANUARY SEVENTH WHICH WE SHOWED UP FOR AND THAT AND THAT WAS SET FOR TRIAL ON MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH MARCH FIRST TWO THOUSAND. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT WAS ONLY AFTER HE ATE HIS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND WE AGREED TO A BENCH TRIAL. WE REPRESENT A WOMAN NAMED KERRY IN A WALL SHOULD DISABLED WOMAN WHOSE CARE IS SUPERVISED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER. THIS IS A CASE AGAINST AN ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY. SHE DEVELOPED A BLOOD INFECTION AND BRAIN INJURY DUE TO AN UNTREATED INFECTION. THE REGIONAL CENTER WE'RE WORKING WITH WOULD LIKE TO FIND FUNDS TO PLACE HER IN A MORE APPROPRIATE SETTING TUTOR INJURIES. WE FILED THAT COMPLAINT. AND THE GUARDIAN ADLAI ITEM APPLICATION WHICH WE NEED TO HAVE SO WE CAN GET A SUMMONS TO START THE COMPLY STARTED GOING. SEPTEMBER FOURTH. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE COURT DID NOTHING FOR FOUR MONTHS WE TRIED CALLING EVERYONE WE TRIED CALLING THE CLERK WE TRIED EMAILING PEOPLE WE YOU KNOW PRACTICALLY STOPPED YOU KNOW I PRACTICALLY STOOD OUTSIDE THE WINDOW YOU KNOW TRY TRY TO GET SOMEONE TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON TRYING TO REACH OUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS ORDER SIGNED AND THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION ON JANUARY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE SO THAT WAS FOUR MONTHS. MY COLLEAGUES THAT REPORTED THE SAME STORIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE TOLD ME THEY REPRESENTED A WOMAN WHO'S AT A NURSING HOME OF THE TRACK TO THAT WAS DISLODGED RESULTING IN A SEVERE LACK OF OXYGEN TO THE BRAIN. THEY FILED THEIR COMPLAINT AND THE GUARD AND PETITION LIKE WE DID IS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ON OCTOBER FIFTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THAT ORDER WAS NOT SIGNED UNTIL DECEMBER EIGHTEENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THAT ORDER SAT ON A DESK SOMEWHERE JUST LIKE OURS. THEN THE COURT DID NOT ISSUE THE SUMMONS UNTIL JANUARY. SIXTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. ANOTHER TOLD ME THAT SHE- AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD CLIENT WAS ACTUALLY THROWN ON THE FLOOR BY CAREGIVERS. SUSTAINED FRACTURES OF THE BONES ON HER FACE. WITH TIME RUNNING SHE QUICKLY FILED AND STARTING AT A LIGHT AND WHAT SHE NEEDED. IT TOOK SIX MONTHS ORANGE COUNTY JUDGE JUST SIGNED THE ORDER. JUST TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO BRING THE CASE. DURING THAT TIME SHE DIED. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE HAVE A LIVING OUT THERE WAITING FOR HER DAY IN COURT. THE FUNDS THAT SHE NEEDS TO CARE FOR HERSELF WITH THE INJURIES SHE SUSTAINED. WHILE WAITING IN THE FACILITY WITH NO FAMILY TO CHECK ON HER. AND NO ONE TO GO WITH THE LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT SHE NEEDS. SHEER DIES OF COVERED. OR LONELINESS. PEOPLE ARE DYING OF LONELINESS. IN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO GO ON WHEN THEIR FAMILY DOESN'T COME. AND THOSE PEOPLE DESERVES TO MOVE OUT OF THOSE FACILITIES AND FIND A BETTER PLACE AND RECEIVE JUSTICE. IF SHE DIES. THE DAMAGES TO COMPENSATE HER FOR HUMAN SUFFERING DIE WITH HER UNLESS AN ATTORNEY LIKE ME AN ELDER ABUSE ATTORNEY CAN PROVE THAT THERE'S CLEAR CONVINCING EVIDENCE. BY A MANAGING AGENT OF RECKLESSNESS. THAT'S VERY VERY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU NEED FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES THIS IS JUST AND WE WAIT. THIS IS A VERY EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT- LEVEL TO REACH AND SO WHAT I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT TO YOU IS THAT JUST WAITING FOR FOUR MONTHS FOR A SIGNATURE SITTING ON A JUDGES STAFF. BUT DOES IT MEAN THAT TO MY CLIENTS. SO ON BEHALF OF C. ROC- YOU KNOW WE FEEL THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND THAT WE THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THREE AREAS NUMBER ONE WE ASK THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PREFERENCE CASES CAN HAVE THEIR TRIAL BEFORE THEY DIED NO MATTER WHAT COUNTY THEY LIVE IN. THE PREFERENCE CASES NEED TO GET A TRIAL DATE. AND THEY SHOULDN'T USE THESE ORDER SHOULD NOT FOR ELDER SHOULD NOT BE SITTING ON THE DESK OF JUDGES. SECONDLY WE THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CRASH PROGRAM TO YOU THE RESTORED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ATTACK THE BACKLOG. THERE'S ALREADY A BACKLOG WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO GET WORSE AND WE NEED TO HAVE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS LIKE OTHER PANELS ARE TALKING ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IN FACT IT'S NOT JUST THE COUNTY EACH JUDGE HAS THEIR OWN RULES WE HAVE NO IDEA. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE PERSPECTIVE PURPOSES POSTED FIGURED OUT. LOOK WE HAVE A- DATA RIGHT NOW TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- RIGHT NOW. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED THE DATA WE NEED THOSE THINGS. BUT WE NEED I THINK THAT THESE COMMITTEES ARE ASKING. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU MONEY. TO DO SOMETHING HERE TO LIKE GET THIS BACKLOG SO WE'RE ASKING TO HAVE THIS WE'RE NOT WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED ALL THE DATA WE KNOW THERE'S A TSUNAMI. IT'S ALREADY COMMON THERE'S A BIGGER. ONE COMING BEHIND IT. SO I OTHER ANYTHING ANYONE NEEDS I'M AT YOUR BECK AND CALL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY- TO LISTEN ON BEHALF OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ELDERLY THANK YOU. STE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ALL THREE AND REALLY. BRINGING AND RELATING THE STORIES AND MAKING IT. PERSONAL UNDERSTANDABLE WHAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE HOWEVER MUCH APPRECIATE THAT.

COULD YOU JUSTICE IS CHARGED TO SEARCH FOR A 310060 DEGREES ACCESS OPPORTUNITY IS HAPPENING IN OUR COURTS. IT'S A SAMPLE IT'S EXPANDABLE IT'S EXCITING AND WHILE STILL MAINTAINING IN PERSON ACCESS AS PERMITTED. HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT TODAY IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE COURT'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SERVICES. AND DEPENDENT UPON THE MANY VERY PUBLIC ORDERS EACH COUNTING THUS RESULTING IN DIFFERENT MEASURES AND EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE APPLICATION OF JUSTICE IS SOCIAL IN NATURE WHAT IS THE CENTRAL COMPONENT IS NOW DANGEROUS TO ALL PARTICIPANTS IN EVEN MORE SO. GIVEN OUR COURTS HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY UNLEASHING THE VACCINES. THE TRIAL COURTS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY IMPLEMENTED MASK WEARING ORDERS.

REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WILL HELP BRING MATTERS FORWARD WHERE APPROPRIATE BUT THESE NEW REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ALSO DELAY CALAVERAS DUE IN PART TO CALL AND GET CONNECTION. AND USE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE APPLICATION. IN MANY COURTS MUST WAIT OUTSIDE IN VARYING WEATHER CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AT THE COURTHOUSE. IN MODERATE THE QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO ALLOW COURT USERS CHECK IN THEN WAIT IN THEIR CAR FOR A TEXT BEFORE ENTERING THE COURTHOUSE. COURTS HAVE A WHOLE AS A WHOLE HAVE PERFORMED HEROICALLY SHIFTING RESHEF CORPORATIONS TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE CHALLENGES. IN MULTIPLE WAYS SINCE THE ONSET OF THE NINETEEN. IMPACTORS RESULT OF CODE IS THE WORST I'VE SEEN IN THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE IN THIS BRANCH. RESTORATION WILL TAKE TIME TO ACHIEVE ONCE IT'S SAFE TO RESUME. NORMAL AND FUNDING IS ONCE AGAIN AVAILABLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SURE THAT PART OF THAT STORY I WOULD BE HONORED TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS EVERHART. DEADLINE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER US USUALLY CENTER ON BURGER FELLOW HOMETOWN HERO AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE- COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER STALLED ON MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC IS OUT ON THE COURTS AND COURT PERSONNEL. AND HERE ARE PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL DETAIL ON THE NUMBERS THEREFORE I'M GONNA TAKE A MORE BROADER APPROACH BY TALKING ABOUT HOW THE PANDEMIC IS SHED SOME LIGHT ON OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. IS CERTAINLY HAS HIGHLIGHTED STRENGTHS. PROVEN LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE G. JUDAS BRANCH MOST READ THROUGH THE TIRELESS EFFORTS OF OUR CHIEF JUSTICE. THE CONSISTENT COLLABORATION WITH JUSTICE PARTNERS. AND EXTENSIVE COMMON GROUND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SHARES WITH BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HEARING TODAY. FROM MISS CHANG AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BAR AND THEIR CHALLENGES AND CHALLENGES THEIR CLIENTS FACE. OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND THEIR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO EQUAL JUSTICE AT ALL TIMES. AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT WHO WE ARE AS JUDICIAL OFFICERS IS BEST DEMONSTRATED DEMONSTRATED BY THOSE THAT WE SERVE. THIS PHOTO COLLAGE PROVIDES. A DEMONSTRATION OF PEOPLE WHO WEEK SERVE WHO COULD BE PEOPLE WE SERVE ON ANY PANEL IN ANY COURTHOUSE DEPARTMENT IN ANY COUNTY. OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE NEED TO PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND YES THAT INCLUDES THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR CIVIL TRIAL PREFERENCE. AND NOT MIS STEP WHERE I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CLIENT IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR THAT. I DO ASSURE YOU THAT THAT THAT'S MORE OF A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH OUR STAFF IS MS EVER HARD JUST DESCRIBED BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT I MYSELF SIT TWO TRIALS FOR PREFERENCE BOTH RESOLVED. BEFORE THEY COULD GO TO TRIAL. JUDGE WE LOST A LOT. MY STILL CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME AND SEE ME WE CAN HAND NOW. CAN YOU SEE ME NOW WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COLLAGE. OKAY I'M TRYING TO GET THAT OFF. WE GO OKAY OKAY YOU SEEN OUT CENTER WE CAN'T. ALL RIGHT SO- SO ALONG WITH THOSE HIGHLIGHTED STRENGTHS BY THE PANDEMIC EXPOSED THE DEPTH OF WEAKNESSES IN SOME LIMITATIONS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM ONE IS OUR RELIANCE ON LIMITED AN AGING SPACE OR PHYSICAL PLANT AND I'M BACK IN A MATTER ABOUT WHICH WE WERE PREVIOUSLY UNAWARE. OF BUILDINGS ALWAYS PRESENTED TO COST BUT WAS FINANCIAL NOW ARE BUILDINGS THAT ARE SPACED REYES HEALTH AND SAFETY COSTS TO PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE TRY AS WE MIGHT JUST SPREAD OUT IN CERTAIN SOCIAL WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS THE REALITY IS WE CANNOT CONDUCT JURY PROCEEDINGS SELECTION OR TRIALS AT LEAST NOT IN THE SAME NUMBERS IN THE SAME REASONABLE TIME SAFELY IN THE LIMITED SPACE WE HAVE IN OUR COURT HOUSES. IN OUR PROGRAMS WE ALL KNOW THE PRIORITY CONSTITUTIONAL PREFERENCE AFFORDED CRIMINAL TRIALS AND THE GOOD REASONS FOR IT PEOPLE'S LIBERTY IS AT STAKE STILL NO ONE WILL DENY THAT WE NEED TO DO ALL WE CAN TO GET TO JUSTICE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD MORE EFFICIENTLY BUT SAFELY WITHIN OUR CURRENT LIMITATIONS. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH REMOTE CIVIL LAW LAWN OTION HEARINGS AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE WILL HELP MOVE THOSE CASES FORWARD HOPEFULLY TOWARD RESOLUTION AND AS WE PROCEED WE CANNOT FORGET THE EXISTING ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS COURT TRIALS EXPEDITED TRIALS. TRIALS WERE YOU STIPULATE TO FEWER THAN TWELVE JURORS ALL OPTIONS UTILIZED DURING THE BEST OF TIMES IT CAN STILL APPLY TODAY SIMILAR ETCETERA BURKE THESE ALTERNATIVES THAT YOU THAT. WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE TOUGH QUESTIONS YOU ASKED ABOUT THE FIVE YEAR STATUTE THE BIG THING WE CAN DO NOW AND THAT WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD WELL. TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT BACKLOG. FROM DAY ONE WE'VE- CREATIVE ALTER. STAGGERING TRIAL TO. CREATING TO CALL HOUSES ONE IN THE MORNING ONE IN THE AFTERNOON. GOING OFF SITE TO LARGER SPACES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. IT IS USE WITH THOSE ALTERNATIVES ROSAMILIA IMMEDIATELY. ISSUES INVOLVING STAFF AND EMPLOYEES WHO BY THE WAY ARE WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES CENTER HERZOG I BELIEVE IT WAS YOU WHO COMMENTED ON THE VACCINE PRIORITY. WE APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT WE MADE THAT REQUEST ALONG WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL NOT TO GAIN ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE BY ANY MEANS IN FACT IT WAS MORE ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES AND THE HEALTH RISKS. THAT THEY ARE UNDER BY SHOWING UP TO COURT EVERY DAY. ALSO THERE ISSUES INVOLVED LOGISTICS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGY OUR SITE WHICH MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND OF COURSE THERE WERE ADDITIONAL COST OF SECURITY AT ON SECURED LOCATIONS. WHICH EXACERBATED THE ALREADY MOUNTING CONCERNS OVER THE INCREASING COST OF COURTHOUSE SECURITY. THIS RESULTED OR ROSA REASONS AND SEVERAL OF OUR COUNTIES. ANOTHER WEAKNESS IS THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY NOW THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES OVER THE YEARS ON TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE MOVE TO REMOTE PROCEEDINGS IN A PANDEMIC HOW TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. SUDDENLY REMOTE ACCESS WAS NO LONGER FOR CONVENIENCE IT WAS A NECESSITY. CHALLENGES AMHERST IMMEDIATELY. FROM TRAINS ARE JUST OFFICES ON DIFFERENT MEDIUMS TO UNEVEN BAND WITH. TO COST. BOTH TO THE COURT AND TO THE PUBLIC. JUST ISSUE INVOLVING EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO LITIGANTS CONSISTENT WITH MR RICHARDSON'S COMMENTS AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO ACCESS TO OUR PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS. FINALLY UNDER THE HEADING OF THE NECESSITY THAT NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. DEMOCRATS ALSO REVEALED POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS WHICH DOUBLE AS REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE. THE NEED FOR GREATER RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY IS A PARENT WE NEED TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR BEST PRACTICES BOTH ON THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. HOW TO APPLY IT IN IN OUR DIFFERENT PRACTICE AREAS EACH OF WHICH WILL BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. BASED ON THE DIFFERENT NATURE OF THOSE PRACTICE AREAS THEMSELVES AND THE DIFFERENT NEEDS OF EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OUR RECORDS SIR. WE NEED TO EXPLORE WHAT. MORE WHAT SOME COURTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH REMOTE JURY PROCEEDINGS WE WILL HERE IN A FEW MINUTES FROM JUDGE DO SO TELLS ABOUT ALAMEDA SUCCESS WITH REMOTE JURY PROCEEDINGS. CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION HAS FORMED A JOINT TASK FORCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IT'S NICE TO SEE MICHELLE BROWN HERE. THAT JOINT TASK FORCE IS LOOKING AT REMOTE TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS WHICH WILL COVER BOTH CORRECT BEST PRACTICES FOR ALL PANELS. AS WELL AS JURY PROCEEDINGS NOW AND GOING FORWARD WITH AN EYE ON WHAT LEGISLATION WE NEED. TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN. THIS IS AND WILL BE ON. THE CODE PANDEMIC. THE IDEA REMOTE COURTROOMS- REMOTE COURT FACILITIES ALSO IS HAS POSSIBILITIES WE DISCUSSED THE POTENTIAL USE OF OFFICE COURTROOMS COUNTY BUILDING STADIUMS STADIUM SEATING. OUR SCHOOLS EVEN THEATERS TO ACCOMMODATE LARGE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CALENDARS THE MORE NON JURY WORK WE CAN DO OFF SITE SAFELY. THE MORE SPACE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CREATE FOR OUR JURIES BOTH CRIMINAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL AND THEY ALL DEMAND AND ALL THAT THE DEMAND IN TERMS OF THE STAFF. THE COSTS AND THE SECURITY WE ARE THE CHIEF JUSTICE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF WHAT ARE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. FINALLY WE NEED MORE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS. ECHOING WHAT MS CHANG SAID WE NEED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND ENGAGE MORE CONSISTENTLY IN DIALOGUE WITH OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS. ON HOW TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS NOT ONLY DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT OTHER POTENTIAL SITUATIONS LIKE NATURAL DISASTERS. ALL RECURRING ISSUES WITH OUR AGING PHYSICAL PLANT LIKE ASBESTOS THAT CAN AND HAVE CLOSED OUR COURTHOUSES IN ORANGE COUNTY AND IN OTHER PLACES. I AM CONVINCED AND I THINK WE ALL ARE AFTER WHATEVER TODAY IT WE WHAT WE DO NOW CAN AND WILL AFFORD OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER EFFICIENCIES. IN OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS. THIS IS A GREAT UP TO START TO START THIS DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO RAISE ISSUES AND DISCUSS ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND STATE WIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROCEED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND ALL OF OUR CASES INCLUDING OUR CIVIL JURY TRIALS. AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW SO WE CAN GET A PLAN. A REALISTIC PLAN WITH A REALISTIC PRICE TAG TO YOU SO WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN SOONER THAN LATER THE TWO HUNDRED THE MORE THAN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS TO FORMULATE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK. SO WE CAN PROVIDE. 109 DEGREES DO YOU CENTER 260 DEGREES ACCESS TO EQUAL JUSTICE EQUAL JUSTICE. FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU JUDGE. NEXT THE PANDA CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF INTERPRETERS. THANK THAT NOONE I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COUNTY FORTY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME'S JANET SHOULD IT COME WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF INTERPRETERS WE ARE THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS ALL INTRUDERS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE FOUR EIGHT GIVE ANY SPECIFIC STATEMENTS LET ME JUST GIVE A BRIEF FULL. INTERPRETERS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO UNEQUAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS D. ONGOING ELIMINATION CONTRIBUTOR POLICE HAVE RESULTED IN GREATER STRAINS IN MAKING INTERPRETERS AVAILABLE. FORCING MANY TO WORK UNDER UNDER ADEQUATE SAFETY PROTOCOLS OFTEN WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. CFRN IS SOMEONE UNIQUE AS IT IS A STATE WIDE UNION WHOLLY COMPRISED OF INTRAPRENEURS NOT JUST FROM A SINGLE COUNTY BUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTS WE REPRESENTED GUARDIAN FOR ALL SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN TRIPURA EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR FOR ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO LANGUAGE ACCESS AND SUPPORT FOR INTERPRETERS. THE COURT INTERPRETERS LINE ITEM IN THE STATE BUDGET FOR WHILE YOU NEED FOR COURT EMPLOYEES REFLECTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL FEDERAL AND STATE SUBMIT MANDATES TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE ACCESS IN ALL CASES. ARE BUDGET ITEM HAS NEVER BEEN DECREASE IT HAS INCREASED EVERY YEAR EVEN DURING THE TIGHTEST OF YOURS. INSPIRE COMMITMENT SEVERAL FACTORS PREPEND THEM IT KEPT COMPLEMENT COMPLICATED THE DELIVERY OF A CONTRIBUTOR SERVICES OVER THE PAST YEAR. I HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAGEDIES FOR TRIPS. FIRST DESPITE THE LEGISLATORS APPROVAL OF OUR OWN OF OUR INCREASE BUDGET LINE ITEM EVERY YEAR MANY COURTS HAVE CUT BACK AND ELIMINATED INTERPRETER POSITION. SOME COURTS HAVE EMPLOYEE POSSESS POSTING IMPROPER POSTINGS IN WHICH QUALIFIED APPLICANTS HAVE APPLIED COULD NEVER GET A CALL BACK. YES TO HIRE THEM ITS CONTRACTORS. COURTS HAVE SHIFTED FROM EMPLOYEE INTERPRETER TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR INTEREST. SANTA CLARA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE 65% THE WORKERS OR CONTRACTORS. THIS RESULTS IN LESS COST EFFICIENCY AND LESS ABILITY AVAILABILITY OF INTERPRETERS AND IS CONTRARY TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWO IN TRIPURA ACT PASSED BY LEGISLATORS. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT INTERPRETERS WITH THE KURDS. GIVEN THAT WE ARE ESTABLISH IS THE REGIONAL KOREAN SYSTEM WITH UNIFORM CONDITIONS INDULGE IN DROUGHT EACH REGION WE REQUESTED TO DISCUSS KEEPING INTERPRETERS HEALTHY AND SAFE- INCUMBENT AT A REGIONAL LEVEL ONLY TO BE TURNED AWAY. FROM THE ONSET WE REQUESTED KEEP E. SPECIFIC PRINTER PRINTERS EVEN GETTING THE BASIC P. P. HE WAS A STRUGGLE SOME COURSEWORK. MORE WORKABLE THAN OTHERS THE P. P. GIVEN WAS NOT ADEQUATE FOR TRUCKERS. PRIOR TO THE SEARCH MOST COURTS WERE FOCUSED ON KEEPING STAFF SOMEONE STATE. BUT AS BACKLOGS PILED UP THE FOCUS CHANGE AS COLBERT'S SURGE RAMPED UP COURTS ALSO INCREASED OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE PRE EXISTING SHRINKING EMPLOYEE POOL SURE OF US WERE AVAILABLE TO COVER THE LANGUAGE YOU NEED TO THE COURT THAT MEANT THE AMOUNT OF WORK OF EACH INTERPRETER INCREASED. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE NEW SEARCH WITH LITTLE PROTECTIONS. RIGHT NOW COURT HEARINGS ARE BEING CONDUCTED MOSTLY BY A MIX OF IN PERSON EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AND IN SOME CASES VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING. HOWEVER INTERPRETERS NOT ONLY WORK IN THE COURTROOMS. INTERPRETERS ALSO WORK IN HALLWAYS AND WAITING AREAS HELPING ATTORNEYS COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CLIENTS AND HELPING WITH FORMS. MANY COURTS ARE SENDING INTERPRETERS TO THE JAILS FOR SECOND. THESE INTERPRETER THESE INTERVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED IN SMALL NON VENTILATED ROOMS INSIDE THE JAIL WITH THE INTERPRETER THE DOCTOR THE DEFENDANT ARE LESS THAN SIX FEET DISTANCE. FROM EACH OTHER FORTY FOUR NINE EVALUATION THAT LASTED OVER AN HOUR. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS THE NORM. UNDER KOBE IT'S JUST DANGEROUS. ON THE ONE HAND IN PERSON IS THE APPROPRIATE INTERPRETER MODEL. FOR MANY REASONS PRIMARILY. TO BENEFIT THE COURT USER THERE IS GREATER CONFIDENCE AND PARTICIPATE SHE IN IN PROCEEDINGS AND SOMEONE IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INTERPRETER. IN PERSON INTERPRETER IT ENSURES QUALITY COMMUNICATION AND ALSO MOST EFFECTIVE AND SPEEDIEST. WE HAVE HEARD FOR THIS FOR YEARS AND YEARS HOWEVER WITH YOUR EMPLOYEE INTERPRETERS EACH EMPLOYEE IS COVERING MORE AND MORE COURT ROOMS IN A SINGLE DAY CREATING GREATER EXPOSURE TO GLOBAL NINETEEN AND LESS EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RELY ON VIDEO REMOTE WHICH LARGELY LARGELY IS INDUCED INEFFECTIVE AND DETRIMENTAL TO THOSE WHO NEED WHO NEED OUR SERVICES. EIGHTY EIGHT DOESN'T GO GO BY WHEN TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T FAIL. AFTER THIS PANDEMIC VIDEO REMOTE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR IN PERSON INTERPRETING. ADDITIONAL INTERPRETERS ARE RECEIVING LESS HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS ANOTHER COURT EMPLOYEES FOR EXAMPLE COURT REPORTERS CLERKS BENCH OFFICERS INSIDE THE COURTROOM- CORRECTLY PROTECTED BY TEXT PLEXI GLASS INTRAPRENEURS ARE NOT. WE ARE GIVEN FUTURE ANY PROTECTIONS UNLIKE OTHER COURTS STAFF THAT WERE PUT IN A CONFINED SPACE INTERPRETERS DO NOT. AN INTERPRETER WORDS SPACE CONSIST OF WORKING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO COURT USERS INSIDE COURTROOMS. NEAR IT BECAUSE THE DEFENDANTS WERE TRANSPORTED TO COURT. IN HALLWAYS AND WAITING AREAS WHICH ARE OFTEN TOO MANY WERE THERE TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS GROUPS CDC RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOT ENOUGH TO FIFTEEN SOCIAL. PROPER SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE MOST TRAGIC OUTCOME IS REDUCED HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS WHAT HAPPENING LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AN INTERPRETER WAS EXPOSED TO COLD IN THE COURTROOM WELL OTHER EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED TO QUARANTINE AT HOME SHE WAS NOT. IN PART BECAUSE THERE WERE FEWER IN TRIPURA EMPLOYEES DESPITE AVAILABLE FUNDING. SHE ASKED FOR TIME OFF TO QUARANTINE BUT WAS DENIED. SHE WAS FORCED TO WORK AND ON HER OWN SOUGHT OUT A CO THAT TEST SHE DAYS LATER SHE RECEIVED NOTICE OF A POSITIVE TEST RESULT. IN THE DAYS SINCE HER EXPOSURE SHE WAS FORCED TO GO TO THE COURTHOUSE. AND BE AROUND HER TRIP THERE COLLEAGUES. AS A RESULT ALMOST TWENTY INTERPRETERS IN THAT COURTHOUSE WERE EXPOSED. SACHEM CAPITAL BECAME SICK WITH A COLD IT. AND FROM THAT EXPOSURE SHE PASSED AWAY JANUARY SEVENTEENTH. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO DAN FELIX. IN A DIFFERENT COURT BUILDING. WO MORE INTERPRETERS HAVE PASSED AWAY SINCE THEN. THESE INTERPRETERS WORK DAILY IN THE ALLEY COURTS S. INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE CONTRACTORS. DAVID BASKET NOT WHAT. WE GOT PORK CHOP KEYCHAIN. IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THEY WOULD'VE OPTED TO THE EMPLOYEE. BOTH OF THESE INTERPRETERS WORKED IN COURTROOMS AND SMALL HOLDING CELL STATES PRIOR TO TESTING POSITIVE. COOLEY CARPAL WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. KEEP YOUR THE HIGH COST OF HEALTHCARE. AS A CONTRACTOR. THEY DON'T HAVE HELP. SINCE THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIONS NO BENEFITS. HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THE HEALTH KERR I'M SORRY HEALTHCARE WORKERS COLLUDED NINETEEN DEATH RATE IS ONE IN SIX THOUSAND WE LOST FOR ANY COURT WITH THREE HUNDRED IN A STATE WHERE THERE'S LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND ENTREPRENEURS WORKING IN THE COURTS. FOR YEARS WHICH HAS STRUGGLED WITH OUR LOCAL COURTS TO BE TREATED ASK RESPECTED. WORKFORCE THEY CUT. OUR RANKS DESPITE WHO FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATOR WE'RE TRYING TO REPLACE IS WITH TECHNOLOGY OR TRIED TO LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY INTERPRET FOR INDIVIDUALS. WE HAD TO SECURE BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE SIMPLY TO ALLOW US TO INTERPRET BETWEEN ATTORNEY AND CLIENT WELL OFF THE RECORDS WERE TAKING A TEN MINUTE BREAK BECAUSE PRESIDING JUDGES WERE TELLING US THAT WE CAN ONLY PROVIDE LANGUAGE ACCESS WHILE ON THE RECORD. THIS CONTINUOUS WAVE UNDERMINING INTERPRETERS AND THOSE WHO USES ARRIED OVER TO SLOPPY AND DEADLY DISREGARD FOR OUR SAFETY. IN KERN COUNTY SEVENTEEN INTERPRETERS WERE FORCED TO SIT IN THE SAME NON VENTILATED ROOM FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AS A QUASI FOR A LITTLE WHILE OTHER EMPLOYEES WERE FREE TO LEAVE THE BUILDING. IN SHORT. THE MOST DANGEROUS PRACTICE DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN KEEPING FEWER PROTECTION TWO INTERPRETERS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES AND NOW WE HAVE LOST THE LIVES OF FOR WORKAHOLICS. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. INTERPRETERS NEED TO BE ANY NEED TO BE PROVIDED WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY TOOLS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR JOBS THIS INCLUDES FACE SHIELD FOR INTERPRETERS. AS CHILLS FOR WITNESSES ARE TESTIFYING THAT USE INSTRUCTORS TWO WAY RADIO INCORPORATE QUICKENING ATTORNEY CLIENT IN JAIL INTERVIEW SHOULD BE CONDUCTED SAFELY WITH CDC GUIDELINES IN MIND. HEALTHSPRING THAT THE DOOR INFORCE MASK WEARING LIMIT THE NUMBER OF COURT USERS STABBER SCHEDULED COURT TIMES TO REDUCE QUARTERS OUR FOOTPRINT CREATE SAY FAIRNESS FOR INTERPRETERS. SO INTERPRETERS CAN DO THEIR OWN COURTROOM AND CELERY DUTIES SAFELY AND IMPROVE CONTACT TRACY. WE NEED STRONG UNIFORM SAFETY PROTOCOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT JUST IN ONE COURTROOM OR IN SOME. COURTS NEED TO HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES INCENTIVIZE COURSE WERE PRIORITIZING THE HIRING WILL PLEASE GIVE CONTRACTORS- ALREADY WORKING PRIMARILY AND MOST OF THE TIME FOR THE COURSE AND EMPLOYMENT AT. JOE WAITED WITH THE RECENTLY ADOPTED DISTRIBUTION OF THE LINE ITEM FUND THAT LIMITS AND PUNISHES COURTS WOULD PRIORITIZE EMPLOYMENT. WE NEED MORE IN PERSON IN TRIPURA POLICE TO REDUCE DELAYS AND WE TACKLE BACKLOG. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR ATTENTION AND THE DOCTOR CHANGED I'M- FORTY ONE AND JUST SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISS YOU TAKE A VERY VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY AND YOUR PASSION CLEARLY FOR THOSE THAT YOU REPRESENT THANK YOU. THE NEXT OF NECESSITY LOUISE SAN FRANCISCO ACCESS CENTER. BUT AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY AND SENATE THE CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY AT THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT I'M PROCEEDING- CAN EVERYONE SEE MY SHIRT SCREEN. AND WE SEE YOUR SCREEN. WE DON'T OKAY GREAT WE SEE ONE. OKAY THANK YOU SO LAST YEAR I GAVE TESTIMONY REGARDING THE SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT IN PERSON DIRECT SERVICES SELF HELP SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL WHICH INCLUDED IT. WALK IN CLINICS WORKSHOPS ONE ON ONE APPOINTMENTS US MAIL CORRESPONDENCE AND COURT ROOM ASSISTANCE. WE KNOW THAT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE A CORE FUNCTION OF THE COURTS AND THAT THE IMPACT OF SELF HELP CENTERS GOES FAR BEYOND JUST DIRECT SERVICES FOR THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. SELF HELP CENTERS STATEWIDE SEE A CHAIN OF INTACT PRE FILING AN ON DAY OF COURT FOR EXAMPLE BY ASSISTING A SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANT WITH THE EXPLANATION OF THE LAW LEGAL PROCEDURES AND FORMS COMPLETION THE SELF HELP SERVICES ENSURE THAT ALL PAPERWORK IS PREPARED AND PACKAGED CORRECTLY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR THE FILING WINDOWS IN CIVIL OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY IN TAKE AN INTERVIEW AT SELF HELP CENTERS PROVIDE A VENUE FOR THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO TELL THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY AND OFTEN SIMPLY THAT THIS PROCESS INCREASES EFFICIENCIES DURING COURT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS CAN THEN FOCUS ON THE ISSUES THAT AND CAN BE BETTER PREPARED WHEN THEY- APPEAR BEFORE THE JUDGE. THE CHANGE IMPACT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR ONCE IT WAS DISRUPTED BY THE FIRST ROUND OF SHELTER IN PLACE CLOSURES YES THE CENTER HAD TO CANCEL ALL APPOINTMENTS AND COMPLETELY SUSPEND ONSITE SERVICES THE SHELTER IN PLACE OF LAW LIBRARIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND LEGAL SERVICES FURTHER REDUCED AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. AT THE SUPERIOR COURT PERSONNEL AND DIVISIONS WERE IMPACTED BY THE CLOSURE OF ACCESS SHERIFF DEPUTIES AT THE COURTHOUSE LOBBY METAL DETECTORS COULD NO LONGER REFERRED SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS DIRECTLY TO ONSITE. HEALTH HELP ASSISTANCE FILING WINDOWS RECEIVED FORMS FROM SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS THAT WERE INCOMPLETE OR HAD NUMEROUS ERRORS AND MISSING PAGES. RECORDS DEPARTMENT AND OTHER CIVIL DIVISIONS WERE INUNDATED WITH TELEPHONE INCREASED FROM SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE SOUGHT ASSISTANCE ON SITE AT THE SELF HELP CENTER. AND FINALLY COURT ROOMS COULD NOT SEND SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO ACCESS FOR EXPLANATION OF COURT ORDERS OR HELP. WITH SERVICE OF PROCESS ISSUES. IN RESPONSE TO THE SHELTER IN PLACE CLOSURES THE ACCESS CENTER BEGAN TO TRANSITION TO REMOTE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY THE DAY AFTER PLACE WAS IN PLACE. AND THROUGHOUT THE THREE MONTHS OF ACCESS CLOSURE ACTUAL STAFF WORK FROM HOME TO CAR TAX SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WITH THEIR PENDING MATTERS PROVIDE LEGAL INFORMATION AND TO RESCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS. A PRIMARY CHALLENGE THAT AXLE STAFF FACED WAS A LACK OF NECESSARY EQUIPMENT REQUIRING STAFF TO USE THEIR OWN. DEVICES THEIR OWN PERSONAL LAPTOPS AND PHONES TO CONTACT. SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MY WEEK TO ACCESS RESEARCH ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WEBSITES SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT VIRTUAL SELF HELP BEST PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AFTER AFTER IT DEVELOPED WRITTEN MATERIALS TO BE PUBLISHED ON THE ACCESS WEBPAGE. THE COURTS CLOSURE ACCESS WORK IN STAGES TO DELIVER SERVICES TO A BROAD SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL PUBLISHING AN ONLINE INFORMATIONAL LIBRARY CREATING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FOR EMAIL INCREASED SETTING UP TO TELEPHONE VOICE MAILS ONLINE CHATS THROUGH LIVE CHAT VIRTUAL APPOINTMENTS USING TEAMS AND ZERO CRACK. ONLINE CALENDAR AND SCHEDULING AND WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF SHELTER IN PLACE ACCESS RETURNED TO THE COURTHOUSE FOR LIMITED ONSITE SERVICES. DURING FACE TO ACCESS BUILT A NEXT REMOTE MODEL AND EXPANDED INNOVATION INNOVATIONS TO INCLUDE TRANSLATION OF ITS INFORMATIONAL LIBRARY INTO THE SPANISH CHINESE VIETNAMESE RUSSIAN AND TO GAWLER LANGUAGES. EMAILS HAVE BEEN STREAMLINED TO ONLINE SURVEY MONKEY AND CURRY'S VOICEMAILS ARE SUPPORTED WITH THE ADDITION OF THE IBR LIVE LINE DURING THE STRIKE AND SHELTER IN PLACE. AXEL'S IDENTIFIED ONSITE SOLUTIONS TO INCORPORATE A KIOSK CHIU MATIC APER TICKETING SYSTEM FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE A COMPUTER OR A SMARTPHONE. BUT OUR FIRST TRANSITION OF CREATING ONLINE RESOURCES STUFF REPRESENT THAT WOULD AGAINST COULD FIND INFORMATION ONLINE TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY INFORMATION AND TO START CASES ON THEIR OWN. WE SAW A MASSIVE IMPACT HERE WITH EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINETY EIGHT HITS ON THE ACCESS SELF HELP WEB PAGE AFTER POSTING ONLINE MATERIALS THE NUMBER OF DAILY WEBPAGE VISITORS NEARLY TRIPLED. TO TRANSITIONING TO OUR VIRTUAL REMOTE MODEL YES THE CENTER HAS PROVIDED DIRECT SERVICES TO EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE. SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHEN WE BREAK DOWN THE DATA WE CAN SEE THAT TELEPHONE ASSISTANCE PROVIDES THE GREATEST ACCESS. IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE THAT A LARGE PORTION OF SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS VISIT THE COURTHOUSE FOR ASSISTANCE EVEN WHEN ACCESS TRANSITION AND IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL VIRTUAL AND REMOTE SERVICE OPTIONS. I WILL JOIN MISS MICHELLE BROWN AND SAY THE HYBRID MODEL IS THE FUTURE OF SELF HELP AS WELL AS OTHER DIVISIONS. AND ACT AS ACCESS CONTINUES TO EXPLORE ENHANCING THE VIRTUAL SELF HELP MODEL. ACCESS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE ONSITE SERVICES FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET NOR COMPUTERS PRINTERS SMARTPHONES PHOTOCOPIER STAPLERS TO HOLD PENSION OTHER BASIC OFFICE SUPPLIES NEEDED FOR COURT FILINGS. ANY SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS ALSO REQUIRE IN PERSON ASSISTANCE FOR COMPLEX MATTERS AND FOR THOSE FACING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES DUE TO LITERACY OR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY PROFICIENCY. SELF. WAS MY TEAM LAST YEAR AND IT CONTINUES TO BE THIRTEEN THIS YEAR A YBRID MODEL OF. BOTH IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL REMOTE SERVICES AND MAXIMIZES THE SCOPE OF SELF HELP SERVICES AND REACHES THE POPULATIONS AND THE MOST ME. I WANT TO ADDRESS EIGHT EIGHT A QUESTION THAT WAS POSED EARLIER TODAY HOW TO DETERMINE BASIC LEVELS OF ACCESS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE HOWEVER COURTS AND- HOW CAN COURTS MEET THAT STANDARD. SO SAN FRANCISCO WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION IT SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL DURING SHELTER IN PLACE BECAUSE WE WERE FORTUNATE TO APPLY FOR AND BE AWARDED GRANT FUNDING FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE BILL TO BUILD. A VIRTUAL SELF HELP CENTER. MANY COURTS ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER COUNTIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS SEEKING ASSISTANCE IN SMALLER COUNTIES SHOULD RECEIVE THE SAME SELF HELP SERVICES AS SELF REPRESENT THAT AGAINST. SEEKING ASSISTANCE FRANCISCO OR COUNTIES WITH GREATER RESOURCES SO OUR EATING LOCAL PLAYING FIELD IS PROBABLY THE BEST START AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MISS LORI APPRECIATE THAT TEST WENT UP JUST A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE JUDICIARY IS A THIRD INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT JUST AS WE WOULD NOT WANT THE COURTS TO TELL US HOW TO DO OUR BUSINESS. I ASSUME YOU DON'T WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR BUSINESS BUT- JUST LOOKING AT TODAY'S HEARING I CAN SEE THE LEVEL OF INTEREST. THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO DEMONSTRATE ONE POINT WE HAD OVER 25% OF THE SENATE WAS HERE FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WE HAD TEN OF THE ELEVEN MEMBERS A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THREE OF THE FIVE BUDGET SUB CHAIRS SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS WHO ARE PRESENT SO THIS IS AN AREA OF. TREMENDOUS INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BEST PRACTICES- AND WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN IN GATHERING THOSE BEST PRACTICES WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE PLAN WERE VARIANTS THE TIMELINE MORE VARIANTS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE DISPARITIES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COUNTIES. OF DOESN'T CONTINUE TO EXIST THAT ONE COUNTY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO JUSTICE NEARLY IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER COUNTY IT MAY BE YEARS BEFORE YOU GET ACCESS TO JUSTICE. SECONDLY IS THE DISPARITY WITH RESPECT TO COST WHERE YOU CAN CALL IN SOME PLACES FOUR ZERO OR YOU CAN ACCESS THE HEARING VIRTUALLY FOR NO COST OTHER PLACES IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER QUARTER CALL ANY OF THAT. SO WE ARE INTERESTED I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE MY CLOTHES MISTER CHAIR BUT BUT IT IS NOT QUITE BUT BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE SOLUTIONS WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE JUDICIARY AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE SYSTEM FIDO'S WHATEVER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF MONEY THE THERE'S A FUNCTION THERE'S ALSO SOME EFFICIENCIES TO BE AFFECTED AND EVENT. SO THANK YOU- QUESTIONS AS- YEAH. I'M YOU KNOW WE FOR LEARNED THAT- BEHAVIORS HAVE CHANGED YOUR INDEPENDENT MAKE WHAT WE WERE THINKING LAST APRIL FOR WHAT THE HOSPITAL SITUATION- INDUSTRY WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOLS WERE THINKING ABOUT HAS RADICALLY CHANGE YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT THAT FOLKS DON'T NEED TO HAVE MASKER HAVE MASK DO WE STAY CLEAN THIS THIS AREA UP HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT WE REALIZE THE BEST PRACTICES DON'T DON'T. NECESSARILY REQUIRE THAT WE BECOME SMARTER IT'D I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS IN THE IN THE COURTS. WHERE ARE WE AT THE VILLAGE WE'VE GOT THIS REPORT ON THE PERSONNEL AND THE COURTS FOR OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS RIGHT NOW WE'RE SITTING ON. FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD WHAT ARE THE THING WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE PRACTICES OTHER THAN THE HYBRID MODEL I GUESS IS WHAT I'M HEARING WHAT ARE THE- WHAT ARE THE- THINGS THAT WE CAN HAVE WE CAN HELP OUT WITH. THAT DON'T INCLUDE I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE ATTITUDES THAT SOME JUDICIAL OFFICERS WILL HAVE OR SET IT. UP COURT ADMINISTRATORS THAT WE CAN WE CAN HELP OUT BECAUSE IT'S NICE TO HEAR THE STORY HOW WE GOT HERE AND ALL THE PAINS AND SUFFERING BUT WE KNOW NOW. WE HAVE TO A DOUBLE MASTER'S THINKING OF THE INTERPRETER MEAN I KNOW. IT SEEMS IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE THINGS YOU COULD DO THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IN APRIL MAY AND I GET I GET THAT BUT NOW. I BE NUTS HAVE A DOUBLE MASS GOING TO WALK INTO A COURT ROOM OR- A PLACE THAT WAS AN AIRPLANE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. OTHER THINGS THAT. THE JUDGES IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THE- INTERPRETERS THAT THEY ALL AGREE ON THE DCR- IRREFUTABLE NOT DEBATABLE PRACTICES TO REDUCE SPECIALLY. KING ABOUT DISTANCE HOW CAN YOU FORCE ELEVEN PEOPLE IN A ROOM RIGHT NOW THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A AN OUTRAGEOUS ATTEMPTED SO. I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT HAPPENED IT'S AN OUT LIAR IT'S NOT PART OF THE PRACTICES THAT THIRD THIRD DOING TODAY SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE PANELISTS. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT ON THE PANEL. I CAN GO AHEAD AND AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ALTHOUGH I THINK IT MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE COURT EXPERIENCE THIS IS NANCY EVERHART AGAIN NUMBER NINETY NOW- YOU KNOW WE'VE LEARNED A LOT SINCE MARCH WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE TO REDUCE SERVICES AND- WE'VE LEARNED WHERE TO GET MASS AND HOW TO WEAR MASKS AND HOW DO. HOW TO APPLY SIGNAGE AND OTHER SOCIAL DISTANCE I THINK SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR AROUND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THE INADEQUACY OF OUR FACILITIES- YOU KNOW WE'VE USE PLEXIGLAS BARRIERS WHERE WE CAN'T BUT IN GENERAL COURT ROOMS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT SO HOW DO WE FIND ALTERNATIVE FACILITIES FOR THAT. POLICING COSTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE IN A TIME WHERE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET AVAILABLE- STAFFING IS NOT AVAILABLE TO HANDLE EXPANDED COURTROOM CASES SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT IF WE HADN'T NEED BUDGET AVAILABLE AND WE HAD STAFFING AVAILABLE WE MAY BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE SERVICES THAT WE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION OR NOT BUT- I CAN'T SAY THAT J. C. SEATED AT. A REMARKABLE JOB OF WORKING WITH CARILLO WE ASKED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PP EQUIPMENT TO THE COURTS AND WERE ABLE TO ORDER THAT DIRECTLY NOW WHICH WAS SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE IN THE BEGINNING AND WE WERE SCRAMBLING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE TO. OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION. ALREADY FOR THAT EQUIPMENT. BUT YOU TO SEPARATE AND ELSE CARE TO. VOLUNTEER NAY. AND THE QUESTION. THIS IS DELAY JUDGE LATE OUT ALL RESPOND FROM CENTER CENTER WHY HOUSE GETS ITS A GREAT A VERY PRACTICAL ONE- AND WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT AS MUSEUM ARTS THAT STATED NAY DO THINK THAT WHILE EVERY COUNTY HAS DEFERRED HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN DIFFERENT STANDARDS BECAUSE THE KOBE IT IMPACT IS DIFFERENT IN MOST COUNTIES I THINK THERE IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS A CONSENSUS OF SOME KIND ON BASIC. HEALTHCARE PRACTICES IT WORLD FOLLOWING IN THE COURTS- I DO THINK THAT IT DOESN'T OF MEDIA AS YOU POINT OUT THE SPACE ISSUE I COME FROM A COUNTY WE WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF TRYING JURY TRIALS INCLUDING CIVIL TRIALS BUT WE'VE HAD ARE LOGS WE'VE TAKEN OUR LUMPS WHERE WE'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN TRIALS WHERE JURORS WITNESSES OR ATTORNEYS HAVE BE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE RIGHT NOW LITTLE TRIAL RESULTING AS YOU HEARD BEFORE MISTRIALS OR CONTINUANCES AND HAVING TO DO OVER SO IT DOESN'T ALLEVIATE THE CHALLENGES SPACE. AS YOU PUT IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IN THE SPACE WE HAVE TO GET TWELVE OR FOURTEEN WITH ALTERNATES. IN ONE ROOM. THANK YOU- CAREER. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR- I GUESS THAT LET ME JUST SAY THAT I'VE REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- I THINK WE EVEN GIVEN US A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF THE CHALLENGES FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVES BOND ON. ON IT YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT A SITUATION WHERE- THE COURTS HAVE THE FINITE SPACE TO WORK IN AND THEY HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES- IN MANY WAYS IN TERMS OF THE TREATMENT OF- THE LEAD AGAINST I'M I GUESS WHAT I WOULD LIKE. NOT EVERYONE TO THINK ABOUT IS. BUT YOU KNOW I TAKE A LOOK AT AT THAT THE BACKLOGS- THE DATA SUCH THAT IT IS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN RESOLVED BY COUNTY AND- AND IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT YOUR BUDGET AND YOUR STAFFING NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE TO BE ABLE TO. GET BACK TO. I TO NORMAL AND I PUT THAT IN QUOTES. BECAUSE IF THERE'S EVER A TIME OR WE HAVE THE RESOURCES IT'S RIGHT NOW AND IF WE WAIT TOO MUCH LONGER- THOSE THE AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE BUDGETS ARE GONNA LOOK IN THE OUT YEARS AND- THE THIS THESE DELAYS AS WE HEARD TODAY ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS AND- THEIR LIVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THIS CORONA VIRUS AND THEN TO ADD. ADD A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT THEY DON'T FEEL. SERVES THEIR NEEDS IS- I THINK IS IT IS NOT A GOOD THING SO- I WANT IT I WANT TO SEE SOME CONSENSUS ON SOME OF THAT AND THE NEXT PANEL IS BEST PRACTICES. AND I WANT TO GET TO IT QUICKLY BUT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE THERE ARE SOME. SOME IDEAS THAT THAT- THAT CAN COME OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SOME BEST PRACTICES THAT THEY ALL AGREE THAT A SHARE AND START DOING. TO EXPEDITE SOME OF THE CASES- AND- AND TELL US WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE AND IT MAY BE THAT IT'S BRINGING STAFF AND JUDGES OUT OF RETIREMENT AND PUTTING THEM. ON A REAL FOCUSED BASIS ON THE CASES THAT ARE THE OLDEST WHERE ARE THE- THEY RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE THEM A TRIAL WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OR WHATEVER THE EXPEDITED. FRAMEWORK IS THAT THAT DOES GET PRIORITIZED AND THEY THEY GET DEALT WITH RIGHT AWAY- BECAUSE IT'S- I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. AND SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF WHAT THAT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE MAKE A PROPOSAL TO US. SO THAT WE CAN GET IT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND WE CAN WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE IN A WAY THAT I THINK STARTS MOVING THINGS. MUCH FASTER. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONIES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY. VERY CLEAR THAT YOU'RE LABORING UNDER A REALLY A BIG BURDEN AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN. BE PARTNERS IN THIS I THINK THE BETTER IT'LL BE. THANK YOU- ANYONE RESPOND TO THAT ON THE PANEL. YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD YES OKAY- SENATE SENATOR RUSSELL. YEAH I HEARD- A LITTLE BIT OF ALL OF ALL OF THEM MIXTA RESPONSE WITH REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF TACKLING BACKLOGS- OR IT'S PROBABLY MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT. I HAVEN'T HEARD A CLEAR CUT WAY OF HOW TO RESPOND TO THE BACKLOG WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE- THIS COURT IN THIS AREA RURAL URBAN WHATEVER IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THERE'S- THERE'S SOME BASICS THERE AND- I AM VERY- I FEEL MUCH BETTER HAVING HEARD FROM THE BEST PRACTICES THAT THERE ARE WAYS OF ADDRESSING THESE CASES SO. HOW COME WE HAVE SUCH DIFFERENT OPINIONS HERE. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG. YEAH. JUDGE LEONIE DON'T START WITH THAT OR ANYONE ELSE ONE OF ALL I BE HAPPY TO. THANK YOU SENATOR OF NUMBER IN THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO I MEAN- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DISPARITY IN HOW WE TACKLE THE BACKLOG I THINK WE'RE STILL-DEALING WITH THE- CURRENT SITUATION AND TRYING TO GET THINGS THROUGH AND TRYING TO. GET TO OUR CURRENT CASES SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE BACKLOG BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE BEEN A COUPLE OF CONSISTENCIES IN OUR TESTIMONY. AND ONE OF THEM WELL IT CAME FROM OUR- MS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE EMPLOYEES AND MORE JUDGES. TO SENATOR- CABALLERO COMMENTS. THE CHIEF JUSTICE DID APPROVE RETIRED BRITISH ALL RETIRED JUDGES TO COME OUT AND HELP US AND- AND A LOT OF OUR COUNTIES INCLUDING HERE IN ORANGE WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT. SO WE ARE UTILIZING THEM. OR THAT BACKLOG. WE ALSO HEARD MORE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE HELPFUL- OR JUDGES WOULD BE HELPFUL WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH SO LUIS ESPADAS. OF THE NEW APPOINTMENT SECRETARY AND I PROMISED AND WE STOPPED TALKING TO HIM SO HE COULD GET BACK TO WORK. PRESENT VERY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF US. AS HE BEGINS HIS NEW TASK AND IT'S A BIG ONE. BECAUSE ALL THE COUNTIES RELEASED A NUMBER OF US. HAVE BACON CD NEED TO BE FELT SO THOSE ARE SOME CONCRETE PLANS FOR A GOOD START. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S REALISTIC FOR US TO COME BACK TO YOU. AS A BRANCH TO COME BACK TO YOU WITH A- WITH A BETTER PLAN. A MORE CONCRETE PLAN THAT INCLUDES A REALISTIC- COST. WHILE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN WILL START WORKING ON THAT BACKLOG AS WE STILL DIG OUT. OF OUR CURRENT. SITUATION RIGHT. THANK YOU. BOB THANK YOU OUR PANEL WERE GONNA NOW TURN TO FOR STONE RIGHT YOU SO- FOR IS INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS AND BEST PRACTICES WE'RE WELCOME MORE CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE DURING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC AND FUTURE EMERGENCIES IN THE PANELISTS FOR THIS OR THE HONORABLE TERRA DO SOL TELLS FOR THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF REFERENCE TO GOOD THINGS GOING ON ALAMEDA COUNTY SOME INTERESTED IN THAT. KATAMARI THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INNER CITY LAW. CENTERS A DIEGO CARDENAS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF BET SAID ACT LEGAL SERVICES DAVID DANIELS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL MICHELLE CALDWELL COURT REPORTER FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND THE HONORABLE MARC YOU HOUSE. L. A. COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AND THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE SO JUDGE DISCOUNT. AFTERNOON I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BACKGROUND NOISE IT'S LIFE LIVING AND WORKING IN DOWNTOWN OAKLAND. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE INVITED TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL HERE THIS AFTERNOON PARTICULARLY UNDER THE CATEGORY OF BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST YEAR IS REALLY AS YOU HEARD FROM EVERYBODY SO FAR TRY TO THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CATCH MY NAME IS STARTING TO TELL I AM THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT I AM ALSO THE VICE CHAIR. OF THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ALL ABOUT HOW WE HAVE MANAGED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE AS WE ALL REMEMBER IT WAS APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO WHEN THIS BEGAN AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC MANNER. IN WHICH IT IS NOW IT WAS ON MARCH FOURTEENTH THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ISSUED ITS FIRST PRESS RELEASE DETAILING THE SAFETY OPERATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS THAT WE WERE PUTTING IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE THEN NEW CORONAVIRUS SPECTER AND IT WAS A MERE TWO DAYS LATER ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. WHERE ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ISSUED AN ORDER SHUTTING ITS COURTHOUSE DOORS AND CEASING ALL COURTHOUSE OPERATIONS IN VIEW OF THE BAY AREA SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER THAT SHORTLY BECAME THE STATE WIDE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER. NOW WE WERE UP AND RUNNING AGAIN AS SOON AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE BY THAT FRIDAY MARCH TWENTIETH WE HAD REOPENED AND WE HAD RESUMED CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE OPERATIONS ON A MUCH REDUCED PLAQUE FOR. BUTFROM THAT POINT UNTIL TODAY WE GRADUALLY OPENED ACROSS. ALL CASE TYPES. AND HOW DID WE DO THAT. WE DID THAT THROUGH REMOTE OPERATIONS. THAT IS THE WAY BY WHICH WE CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BALANCE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO KEEP COURT USERS AND POOR DEPLOYS SAFE THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS ACCOMMODATE AND SATISFY THE DIRE ACCESS TO JUSTICE NEEDS THAT ALL LITIGANTS AND MEMBERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEAT. SO HOW DID WE DO THIS I'M GONNA BRING EVERYBODY BACK TO THE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE ADDITIONAL REMARKS OF JUDGE ANDERSON. AS WE RECALL FROM THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF APRIL APRIL SIX WHERE THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. ISSUED A SERIES OF EMERGENCY RULES THESE EMERGENCY RULES GAVE LOCAL COURTS LIKE OUR OWN. THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE OUR OWN WHEN I MERGING SEAT LOCAL RULES. AND ONE OF THESE EMERGENCY RULES WAS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND THAT WAS EMERGENCY ROLE THREE. THAT GAVE THE COURTS THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER REMOTE FOR STUDENTS. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT THAT IS WHAT WE DID IT IMMEDIATELY THAT SAME DAY OUR COURT ISSUED AN EMERGENCY LOCAL RULES MANDATING. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS IN ALL CIVIL CASE TYPES. THAT MEANS CIVIL LIMITED CIVIL UNLIMITED INCLUDING COMPLEX IT INCLUDES PROBATE IT INCLUDES FAMILY. AND WE SIMILARLY SET UP REMOTE OPERATING SERVICE THROUGHOUT OUR COURTS INCLUDING REMOTE OPERATIONS INTERVIEWS COUNSELING SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS IN OUR ELF HELP CENTER AS WELL AS A NEW LIVE CHAT FORUM. INCLUDING FAMILY COURT SERVICE MEDIATORS AND CHILD CUSTODY FACILITATORS. WE ESTABLISH SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE DEPARTMENTS WE SET UP INFORMAL PRE TRIAL HEARING CONFERENCES WE SET UP CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCES WE MODIFIED CALENDARS WE CONSOLIDATED RESOURCES AND WE ADDED CALENDARS BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TO MOVE TO THIS NEW REMOTE CLASS FOR. OUR OPERATIONS HAVE CHANGED ENTIRELY ACROSS THE BOARD AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE COULD KEEP OUR COURT DOORS OPEN. YOU HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THE COURT HAVE WITH OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS PRE PANDEMIC. MOST OF US ARE IN OLD FACILITIES. OLD BUILDINGS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES WITH VERY LITTLE SPACING OPPORTUNITIES. USING JUST ONE OF OUR TEN COURTHOUSES ALAMEDA COUNTY AS AN EXAMPLE. OUR ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING WHERE OUR CIVIL TRIALS ARE HELD THE MAJORITY OF OUR CIVIL TRIALS ARE HELD. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COURT ROOM. IN THAT BUILDING. THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE WITH SIX FOOT SOCIAL DISTANCING TWELVE JURORS. THE MOST WE CAN MANAGES NINE. OBVIOUSLY AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. WHICH IS WHY WE MOVED TO THE REMOTE PLATFORM. THAT WAS THE DAY TO BRING THE LITIGANTS THE COURT USERS AND ALL OF OUR COURT PERSONNEL BACK TO COURT TO KEEP US RUNNING AND OPERATING THROUGHOUT. SO WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM THESE REMOTE EXPERIENCES WELL I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST BY ANY STRETCH THAT THIS HAS BEEN A SMOOTH RIDE IT'S BUMPY AND IT CONTINUES TO BE- WE PIVOTED AT AND- SHOCKINGLY RAPID RATE THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE. WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL GLITCHES THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE CAN BUILD UPON. BUT BY AND LARGE WE HAVE RECEIVED OVERWHELMING POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM ALL WHO INTERACT WITH OUR COURTS. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ATTORNEYS THE LEAD AGAINST THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS ALL OF OUR COURT USERS FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THOSE POSITIVE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES STARTING OF COURSE WITH THE USERS AND SOME OF THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE BIT REPETITIVE BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME. HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE SAME POSITIVE BENEFITS. IN TERMS OF THE COURT USERS AND THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE RECEIVED. THEY LIKE REMOTE APPEARANCES BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE CONVENIENT. BACK ON DECEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS STAFF AND ADDITIONAL JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEMBERS VISIT IT ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT FOR ONE DAY. THROUGH A PRIOD OF APPROXIMATELY SIX HOURS WE TOOK THEM THROUGH TEN. DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT CASE TYPES. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE PHYSICALLY VISITED OUR COURTS BEFORE AND THE WAY WERE SPREAD OUT YOU KNOW THAT NEVER COULD HAVE HAPPENED. IF WE HAD NOT BEEN OPERATING REMOTELY. AND MUCH AS THOUGH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR COURTS. DO USERS BENEFIT IN THE SAME WAY THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN THE SAME WAY. ATTORNEYS ARE ABLE TO APPEAR IN MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. IN MULTIPLE COURTHOUSES AND IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN A SINGLE DAY WITH OUT BURDENING THEIR CLIENTS WITH THE ASSOCIATED TRAVEL COSTS. OR THE COST OF SITTING IN A COURTROOM WAITING FOR THEIR CASE TO BE CALLED. THE LITIGANTS THEMSELVES BENEFIT IN THAT SAME WAY. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO TAKE A FULL DAY OFF WORK AND SECURE CHILD CARE OR DEPENDENT CARE OR MAKE ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS. THERE'S NO NEED TO TRAVEL THROUGH TRAFFIC OR FIND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND FIGHT PERFECT PARKING DIFFICULTIES TO MAKE IT INTO A COURT ROOM. INSTEAD WITH VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS. MEMBERS WHO NEED TO ACCESS OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY HAVE THAT CAPABILITY. AND I WANT TO THROW IN SOMETHING BECAUSE OF THE COST PIECE FOLKS HAVE ASKED ABOUT THE DISPARITY IN COSTS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK INTO. AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO VARY BY JURISDICTION AND BY RESOURCE IT'S NECESSARY THAT WAY. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAD A REMOTE MANDATE THAT IS WHAT SET UP OUR COST STRUCTURE OR LACK THEREOF. SO AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THAT REMOTE MANDATE THE COURT IS SHOULDERING THE COST OF THESE REMOTE OPERATIONS I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE CAN DO THAT. SO IN ONE OF THOSE ASKED FOR THE FUTURE THAT SOMETHING FOR ALL OF US TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE ALL OF THIS OF COURSE COST MONEY. NOW IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL PREFERENCES AS TO THESE REMOTE OPERATIONS ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SOMETIMES IS NOT BROUGHT OUT. IS THE COURT EXPERIENCE IN PERSON. CAN BE FRIGHTENING. CAN BE INTIMIDATING. CAN BE AWKWARD. IT IS MOST CERTAINLY UNFAMILIAR FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. WHO USE OUR SERVICES. THE NICE THING ABOUT A REMOTE PLATFORM IS IT TAKES THAT UNFAMILIARITY AWAY. THE INDIVIDUAL USER CAN REACH OUT TO THE COURT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS CAN GAIN ACCESS TO JUSTICE FROM THE COMFORT OF WHERE EVER THEY ARE. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT TAKE PLACE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTEXTS. THERE'S BEEN TALK TODAY ABOUT RESTRAINING ORDER HEARINGS FOR EXAMPLE AND THE URGENCY OF THOSE COURT PROCEEDINGS AND WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE. RESTRAINING ORDER HEARINGS UNDERSTANDABLY ARE SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS COURT APPEARANCES THERE ARE. S. ARCH FAMILY COURT HEARINGS. IN THESE TWO AREAS IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE FEEDBACK TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF REMOTE APPEARANCES BECAUSE IT TAKES DOWN THE TEMPERATURE LEVEL. YOU ARE NOT ONLY NOT IN AN UNFAMILIAR AREA BUT YOU'RE NOT FORCED TO SIT ACROSS THE TABLE. FROM SOMEBODY THAT YOU ARE IN A VERY ANTAGONISTIC. AND POTENTIALLY FRIGHTENING RELATIONSHIP WITH. YOUR DISTANCED BY THE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY IN A POSITIVE WAY THE NEW NAVELS MANY PEOPLE TO SPEAK MORE FREELY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN A MORE OPEN DIRECT WAY THAT ULTIMATELY HELPS THE TRIER OF FACT ASSESS THE VERACITY. AND DETERMINE WHAT'S THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE. I THINK ALSO FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR COLLABORATIVE COURTS. WHERE WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEALING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS MAY HAVE PTSD. IN MANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES COMING TO COURT CAN BE WHAT'S CONSIDERED A TRIGGERING EVENT. IT TAKES THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THEIR TREATMENT FACILITY IT TAKES THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THEIR COMFORT SETTING AND PUTS THEM BACK POTENTIALLY IN THE SAME KIND OF TRIGGERING OR TRAUMATIC CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY SET BACK THEIR REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REACH THESE PEOPLE. TO BRIDGE WHATEVER TECHNOLOGICAL GAPS THERE MAY BE AND BRING THEM TOGETHER PROVIDING COURT SERVICES WHILE STILL ENABLING THEM TO MAINTAIN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT'S SO NECESSARY FOR THEIR ON GOING PROGRESS. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. ONE OTHER TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'VE TALKED EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THE ACCESS PIECE AND HERE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE LIVE STREAM ALL OF OUR PROCEEDINGS VIA AN AUDIO LAKE. WE ALSO OFFICE OFFER THE MEDIA THE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE VIDEO ACCESS. WE HAVE ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE COURT IS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN OPERATION DURING THE RIGHT WAY SO WE CAN REACH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IN AN APPROPRIATE EVENHANDED UNBIASED MANNER. AS THE CHIEF HAS LED WE ENGAGE IN A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE SCHOOLS SEX IN THE EDUCATION PLATFORM. HOW GREAT IS IT NOW FOR STUDENTS. INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE COURT SYSTEM ABOUT THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE JUDICIARY AND COURT OPERATIONS TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN A LOT. TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN A COURTROOM DAY TODAY. WE TALKED ALREADY TODAY ABOUT JURY SERVICE. AND HOW CHALLENGING IT IS FOR JURORS TO COME TO COURT A MISTER PANDEMIC. IT'S CHALLENGING FOR JURORS TO COME TO COURT WITH OUT A PANDEMIC. IN A COUNTY LIKE ALAMEDA AS BIG AS OURS. IT TAKES TIME. YOU HAVE TO DRIVE OR SECURE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. TRY AND FIND CLOSER PARKING WHEN THERE IS NONE AND THEN SIT IN A CROWDED JURY ASSEMBLY ROOM PERHAPS ALL DAY TO RECEIVE YOUR FIFTEEN DOLLARS. IT'S DISCOURAGING. WITH OUR REMOTE OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE EXTENDED TO JURY TRIALS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE CIVIL CONTEXT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A BETTER YOUR RESPONSE RATE. WHICH I THINK OF SOME OF THE REASONS WHY JURORS CANNOT SERVE ON JURIES AND IN ADDITION TO DEALING WITH THAT DO YOU DISTANCE AND TRANSPORTATION ASPECT THERE'S THE TIMING PEAKS. IT GOES BACK TO THE TAKING TIME OFF WORK. TO MISSING NECESSARY MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS TO DEALING WITH CHILD CARE INDEPENDENT CARE CHECK UP AND DROP OFF ISSUES ESPECIALLY TODAY IN THE TIME OF DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A REMOTE JURY TRIAL. WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL JUROR CAN PARTICIPATE FROM THEIR OWN COMFORTABLE SAFE LOCATION. MANY OF THESE IMPEDIMENTS ARE REMOVED AND IT IS IN FACT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF JURORS WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE ON THESE PANELS. IN ADDITION WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE PRESENTATION PIECE LET'S GO BACK TO THINKING ABOUT A TRADITIONAL CORPORATE. WELL WE HAVE TWELVE INDIVIDUALS SITTING IN THE JURY BOX USUALLY LOOKING AT A WITNESS TESTIFYING SIDE WHAT'S- ON ONE SIDE OF THE COURT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURTROOM YOU MIGHT HAVE AN OLD TV MONITOR A PULL DOWN SCREEN OR SOME OTHER DISPLAY MECHANISM WHERE THE ATTORNEYS OR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS ARE TRYING TO SHOW THEIR RESIDENTS TO THE JURORS. IN THE BEST SCENARIO IT'S IMPERFECT. WE DO OUR BEST TO PRESENT AS WELL AS WE CAN BUT WE ALL DEAL WITH THE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL COURTHOUSES AND pNICE THING ABOUT OUR REMOTE COURT JURY TRIAL OR OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS. IS THAT THE TRIER OF FACT WHETHER IT'S A JUDGE JURY JUROR. IS LOOKING AT ALL OF THE WITNESSES THE SAME WAY. EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT WITNESS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM. TO SEE AND HEAR ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE THAT STABLE INTERNET CONNECTION. TO SEE AND HEAR THE WITNESSES THE SAME WAY. TO SEE AND HEAR THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED THE SAME WAY. WE'VE HAD INSTANCES WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THE WITNESS TESTIFY AND WITH THE CONVENIENCE OF THE SPLIT SHARED SCREEN IMMEDIATELY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE VIDEO PLAYING THAT THE WITNESSES TESTIFYING ABOUT. THERE ARE FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITIES. THAT REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF WHERE OUR COMMUNITY IS TODAY FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND FUNDAMENTALLY. WHEN WE HOW THE STABLE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. IT HAS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE COURT ACCESS. IF WE LOOK AT RECENT EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUSTIN ALAMEDA COUNTY ITSELF WHERE AS I SAID WE ARE OFFERING REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS ALL CASE TYPES. THAT MEANS WE HAVE ATTORNEYS APPEARING REMOTELY LITIGANTS APPEARING REMOTELY SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS APPEARING REMOTELY. WITNESSES APPEARING REMOTELY SUPPORT PEOPLE APPEARING REMOTELY INTERPRETERS CANNOT APPEAR REMOTELY. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES ARE CLEAR. IN TERMS OF ACCESS WE'VE TALKED ALREADY ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN HAVING TO TAKE A DAY OFF WORK. TO COME TESTIFY OR DEFEND THEMSELVES OR TAKE A POSITION IN AN IN PERSON COURT HEARING. NOW GETS TO A CHEER FROM THEIR HOME LOCATION. WE'VE HAD EXAMPLES WHERE IN CRIMINAL SENTENCE SIX. SOMEBODY RECENTLY RELEASED FROM A LOCKDOWN FACILITY HAS SECURED A NEW JOB. RATHER THAN HAVE TO TRY AND TAKE TIME OFF WORK DURING THAT PROMOTION. WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUALS CALL IT. ON OUR ELECTRONIC PLATFORM YOU CAN USE IT FROM A MOBILE PHONE OR ANY KIND OF SMART DEVICE. CALL IN TO COURT AND YOU CAN WITNESS THAT INDIVIDUAL IN A CONSTRUCTION UNIFORM. IN THE PARKING LOT OF THEIR NEW JOB. PARTICIPATING IN THEIR COURT PROCEEDING AND ABLE TO RETURN. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO THE SAME SETTING THAT THEY CAME FROM. WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL IN A TRAFFIC PROCEEDING CHALLENGING THEIR INFRACTION OR THEIR TICKET. I RECALL ONE WHERE WE HAD SOMEBODY WITH A BROKEN ARM. IT WAS CLEAR THAT PERSON WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE TO COURT BUT RATHER THAN HAVE TO CONTINUE THE MATTER. THAT PERSON WAS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. WE'VE HAD INTERPRETER CASES WITH. LANGUAGES THAT ARE LESS COMMON OR LESS ACCESSIBLE OR NEED RELAY INTERPRETERS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LINK THAT WORKS THROUGH REMOTE TECHNOLOGY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADULT CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO BE AT HOME OR AT A WORKPLACE WITH THEIR DEPENDENT. AND IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP. THERE CERTAINLY ARE SOME BUT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN THE SECOND REMOTE JURY TRIAL THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY ENGAGED. WE CALLED IT WAS A PREFERENCE CASE WE CALLED IN APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE JURORS OVER SEVERAL SESSIONS. THEY WERE ALL GIVEN A QUESTIONNAIRE. AND BECAUSE WE KNEW THIS TRIAL WAS GOING TO BE CONDUCTED REMOTELY. WE MADE SURE THAT THE INITIAL QUESTIONS INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN A JURY TRIAL REMOTELY. AND DO YOU HAVE STABLE SECURE OR TECHNOLOGICAL ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. ALL OF THAT APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE JURORS THAT WERE CALLED IN. MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THERE WERE ABOUT SIX. WHO SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE NO REMOTE JURY TRIAL OR DID NOT HAVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY TO ENABLE THEM TO DO SO. THAT'S TREMENDOUS IN TERMS OF THE SHOWER. I CAN GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT GOES TO THE QUESTION I ASKED EARLIER ABOUT A FUTURE ASK. WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE ATTORNEYS AND ALBEIT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A WELL RESOURCE CASE BUT WE'VE HAD ATTORNEYS IN WELL RESTORES CASES PROVIDE CLEAN TABLETS. TO ALL OF THIS WERE JURORS IN THEIR CASES TO ENSURE THAT ALL JURORS HAD THE EXACT SAME. TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SAME ACCESS TO THE COURT PROCEEDINGS. SCHNAPF IS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES. BUT THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO BALLOTS THAT TREMENDOUS NEEDS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL COURT USERS ALL COURT MEMBERS. YES GUARANTEED ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT. SO TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE ENVISION GOING FORWARD WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE REMOTE ACCESS WELL AS I SAID THERE HAVE BEEN BUMPS THERE HAVE BEEN GLITCHES THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS. THAT WE CAN IMPROVE UPON. THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE. HAS BEEN SO POSITIVE AND THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY BALANCE THOSE TWO ISSUES HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ACCESS APPEARS TO BE THROUGH THESE REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES WE JUST NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO THE SAME LEVEL TO GUARANTEE ITS UNIVERSALIST CRAWL ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. SO TO THE QUESTION AS TO HOW DO WE DO THAT. ALL BREAK IT DOWN INTO TWO AREAS. NUMBER ONE STAFF. WE NEED STAFF I CAN'T SAY THAT OFTEN UNTOUCHED. AS MISS AMBER HEARD ALREADY SAID THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE THEY ARE WORKING NONSTOP THEY ARE STRESSED THEY ARE STRAIGHT NO ONE IN THE COURT HAS TAKEN A BREAK SINCE MARCH OF. TWENTY TWENTY. USING L. A. COUNTY AS AN EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET. OUR STAFF OVER 80% OF OUR BUDGET. THIS IS WHAT TIES DIRECTLY TO OUR BACKLOG. WITH THE BUDGET CUTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCE DURING THIS FISCAL YEAR THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. WE'VE HAD TO IMPOSE FOR LOS. WE'VE HAD TO IMPOSE HIRING FREEZE. WE'VE HAD VOLUNTARY TIME OFF PROGRAMS WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF BUDGET REDUCTIONS TO TRY AND KEEP THE SHIP MOVING WITH OUT A CLOSURE. THE LACK OF STAFF LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN BACKLOG. LAST YEAR OVER 41% OF OUR EMPLOYEES TOOK SOME KIND OF FORMAL LEACH. ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING A 10% VACANCY RATE AT LEAST. THAT TELLS YOU WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S AS MUCH AS A 50% REDUCTION AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME NOW I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THAT WAY EVERY DAY BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THE NUMBERS ARE SHOCKING. AND THAT'S WHERE THE BACKGROUND HAPPENS. WHEN WE TOOK OUR VOLUNTARY TIME OFF PROGRAM OVER THE HOLIDAYS AS A COST SAVING MEASURE. BECAUSE IT WAS THE HOLIDAYS AND WE ALREADY KNEW WE HAD REDUCE COURT OPERATIONS WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT TIME TO REDEPLOY THE STAFF THAT WE HAD WORKING TO FOCUS DIRECTLY ON THE BACK LOCK. AND WE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO REDUCE OUR FILING DELAYS JUST IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD. WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE HIRE STAFF ON A FULL TIME BASIS WE CAN DEVELOP THAT STAFF TO THE BACKLOG WE CAN DEVOTE THAT STAFF TO CASE PROCESSING WE CAN DEVOTE THAT STAFF TO REMOTE JURY SELECTION SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE TRIALS OUT. BUT WE CAN'T DO IT WITH THIS HUGE WITHOUT THIS HUGE STAFF HE'S SATISFIED. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE SECOND PIECE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT NOT THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. ALL COURTS AND THIS IS WHERE THERE'S THE DISPARITY IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTS. WE ALL ARE IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF BANDWIDTH WEALL HAVE DIFFERENT COURTHOUSE STRUCTURES WITH SIX FOOT CEMENT WALL SEPARATING OUR INDIVIDUAL COURTHOUSE CHAMBERS. WE NEED EXPANDED CONSISTENT RELIABLE BANDWIDTH AND THE FUNDING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE NEED SOFTWARE LICENSES ACROSS THE BOARD THAT HAS SECURITY AND CAN ACCOMMODATE MULTI PARTY PLATFORMS. WE NEED THINGS LIKE MULTIPLE MONITORS JUDGES THAT ARE PRESIDING OVER REMOTE REMOTE JURY TRIALS AND CLERKS WORKING IN COURT ROOMS WITH REMOTE HEARINGS NEED DUAL MONITORS TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE EVERYBODY GOING ON. WE NEED ADDITIONAL VIDEO EQUIPMENT AND THE COURTS WHICH INCLUDE MODERNIZE DISPLAY CAPABILITIES SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN COURT CAN BE SEEN COOLEY FROM EVERY ANGLE. WE NEED UPGRADED AND EXPANDED VIDEO AND PROJECTION EQUIPMENT TO ENABLE THAT EQUAL VIEWING AND ALL CORPORATES. WE NEED INTEGRATED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT MATCH WITH INTEGRATED JURY SYSTEMS. WE NEEDEVIDENCE PRESENTATION SYSTEMS THAT ARE USER FRIENDLY SO THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN USE IT ESPECIALLY THOSE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS KEEPING IN MIND THE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES AND THE SMALL CLAIMS CASES THAT ARE ONLY GOING TO INCREASE WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER RELATED LOSS. WE NEED THINGS LIKE ELECTRONIC HEADSETS OR CONFERENCE CALL CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE THE INTERPRETER ISSUES THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME ABOUT. AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE MORE PROACTIVE LIKE ELECTRONIC RESOURCE LIBRARIES WIFI HOT SPOTS THE ABILITY TO OFFER OUT TABLETS SMARTPHONES MOBILE DEVICES ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. THAT DOES THAT DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TO USE. SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW IDEAS TO THROW OUT FOR ALL OF YOU TO CONSIDER AND WHEAT AS THE COURT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF YOU. TO MOVE THIS PROGRESS FORWARD. THESE CHANGES WERE FORCED UPON US. WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS KEEP ALL THE GOOD THAT CAME WITH. REFINE THE PRACTICES IMPROVE UP HONDA. AND WILL FORWARD IN A WAY THAT REALLY IS GUARANTEEING THAT WE ARE PROVIDING EXPANDED ACCESS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE FOR ALL WHO WANT TO USE OUR JUDICIAL SERVICES. SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I KNOW WE'RE LATE AND I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PANELISTS I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME. AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS NOW OR LATER THAT ANY OF THE ATTENDEES HALF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUDGE AND YES WE ARE RUNNING LATE WE LET IT. SORT OF OUT OF TIME TO FOLKS AND WE'RE- RUNNING PRETTY FAR BEHIND- BUT THE INFORMATION IS GOOD. AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS HEARING WAS DESIGNED TO TRY AND- RESET IT SO OUR NEXT. HELLO THIS IS ADAM MURRAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INNER CITY LAWCENTER. THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE MYSELF ON SCREEN BUT CAN PEOPLE HEAR ME YES BECAUSE SEE YOU AND HEAR YOU OKAY WONDERFUL. SO- THANK THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS ADAM MARIE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INNER CITY LAW CENTER WHICH IS A FIFTEEN YEAR TERM NEED NONPROFIT POVERTY LAW FIRM LOCATED IN THE SKIN RUN NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES. WE FOCUS ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- WE WORK WITH CLIENTS WHO ARE EITHER EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR VERY PRECARIOUSLY HOUSED WERE STRUGGLING TO GET INTO HOUSING OR RETAIN THEIR HOUSE- AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AND WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU BRINGING SUCH ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE PRESENTATION I JUST HEARD- BY THE HONORABLE JUDGE FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS- AND TO ME IS REALLY MODEL. FOR WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING ACROSS OUR STATE WHEN I HEARD HER SAY WAS THAT IMMEDIATELY THE COURT FOCUSED ON WHAT I WHAT I THINK ARE THE TWO PILLARS THAT SHOULD BE DRIVING. OUR CONVERSATION OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA THE TWO COLORS IN MY MIND OR SAFETY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE I WANT HER THE JUDGE SAYING IS THAT FIRST THEY MADE SURE THEY WERE BEING SAFE. AND FOR THAT WHAT THAT MEANT IS THEY NEED TO BE REMOTE AND SO THEY MANDATED REMOTE ACCESS AND THEN THEY SPENT THE LAST ELEVEN MONTHS FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO THAT AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. AND I WOULD NOTE. THAT WELL IN SOME INSTANCES. SAY AN AXE. CAN SIT INCOME DURING. WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE ARE LOTS OF INSTANCES WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY REINFORCE. ONE ANOTHER I THINK YOU HEARD THAT IN THE PRESENTATION JUST READ ABOUT ALL MEDIA. IS THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE AROUND ACCESS THAT MAKE EVERYBODY SAFER AND THINGS CAN BE BLOWN AROUND SAFETY THAT IMPROVE ACCESS AS WELL. SO THESE AREN'T ALWAYS CONFLICTING IDEAS AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR COURT ROOMS ARE SAFE. AND THAT WE MAXIMIZE. ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC TO OUR JUDICIARY SYSTEM- SO I HAVE THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO- AND INTERESTING OF THE FACT THAT THAT AS YOU JUST MENTIONED- WE ARE WE ARE RUNNING A BIT LATE THAT I WILL QUICKLY RUN THROUGH THAT I WANT TO SHARE. THE FIRST IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE UNSAFE PROCEEDINGS IN MANY OF OUR COURT ROOMS ACROSS THE STATE- I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE ALAMEDA MODEL ALAMEDA MODEL YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. IS THAT IT. FOR MOSTLY CANCER MANY LITIGANTS IN THE STATE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THOSE BENEFITS. IN MANY INSTANCES ACROSS THE BAY DOWN HERE IN LOS ANGELES PEOPLE ARE STILL HAVING TO GO INTO COURT. IN VERY UNSAFE SITUATIONS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS NOT JUST THOSE SITUATIONS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT FROM THE CHIEF JUSTICE. WHICH ARE CERTAINLY SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING ISSUES WITH IT SHE RACED AROUND THE PEOPLE'S LIBERTY IS AT STAKE OR THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH OR SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN PERSON. BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING A LOS ANGELES. WE ALSO HAVE. ROUTINE I TRAFFIC MATTERS BEING HEARD IN PERSON SO WE HAVE A CLIENT WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE FINE RELATED OR CRACKED WINDSHIELD THEIR ONLY OPTION. IS TO SHOW UP AT A CROWDED WAREHOUSE AND GO INTO A CROWDED COURTROOM. AND DEAL IN WHAT I BELIEVE IS A VERY UNSAFE WAY WITHOUT CITATION. CENTRALLY IN OUR VISION MATTERS- AND THESE ARE DONE IN LOS ANGELES ON A JUDGE BY JUDGE DETERMINATION EACH JUDGE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO THE SIDE. TO WHAT DEGREE SOMEONE FACING EVICTION. FROM THEIR HOME AND THEIR LAWYER IF THEY'RE REPRESENTED. SHOULDN'T REQUIRED TO COME INTO. IN WITH THEIR ANTICS MATTER IF THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE A- AND THE RIGHT TO STAY IN HOME OR WHAT DEGREE THEY CAN DO THAT REMOTELY- I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT KNOW THAT THESE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THE- RATE. THE GREATEST CONTINUATION OF IN PERSON PROCEEDINGS OR WHATEVER WE SEE LOW INCOME LITIGANTS AND MOSTLY BLACK AND BROWN THAT AGAINST IN OUR COURT ROOMS- THAT'S MY FIRST POINT IS THAT THIS CONTINUES TO GO ON AND CONTINUES TO GO ON AREAS. THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNSAFE AND THAT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL URGE. THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST. BUT STILL HAPPY IS IN SAY THE IDEA THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO CONDUCT IN PERSON PROCEEDINGS. IN NONESSENTIAL MATTERS. WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST. PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS SEEN IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. I DON'T BELIEVE WHY WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE THAT. AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE TESTIMONY TODAY IS ROOTED IN OUR DECENTRALIZATION OF HOW WE ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW OUR COURTS ARE OPERATING. SO WE HAVE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY COURTS ON MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR COUNTY. AND WHAT'S OPEN AND WHAT'S CLOSED AND WHAT THE REMOTE PROCEDURES ARE I'M NOT EVEN ALWAYS ON FIFTY EIGHT LEVELS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL. DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THOSE COURTS ARE MAKING DIFFERENT DECISIONS AND IN MANY INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE AS I JUST MENTIONED INDIVIDUAL COURTS WE ACTUALLY. INDIVIDUAL JUDGES HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT JUDGES ACROSS OUR STATE MAKING THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS SAFE AND WHAT IS NOT SAFE. I BELIEVE THAT THE CHAOS THAT WE ARE SEEING AND EXPERIENCING. I DON'T USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY I REALLY THINK IN MANY. CASES IT IS CHAOTIC. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS BECAUSE- BY DECENT. AND THAT D. CENTRAL. IS JEOPARDIZING BOTH SAFETY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING THAT YOU HAVE NOT HER. IN THE BACK OF A SECOND YOU HAVE FOR LOTS OF VERY CREATIVE. VERY HARDWORKING REPORTS FROM THE COURTS ABOUT THINGS THEY HAVE DONE TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES AND EVEN THOUGH I AM. SO VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THESE THINGS I RECOGNIZE THEY ARE COMPLICATED I RECOGNIZE THERE'S LOTS IN THE WEST. BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE COURTS FOR THE MOST PART WAS HEY WE'VE DONE A LOT. YOU DIDN'T HEAR THEM SAY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING IN OUR SMALL COURT ROOMS ARE SAFE. AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE NOT HEARD THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS BACK THAT UP. I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT BUT NEITHER ARE THE JUDGES THAT WE'RE ASKING. INDIVIDUALLY COURTROOM BY COURT ROOM OR ACROSS. DEPARTMENTS YOU MAY THESE. THEY'RE NOT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE- I BELIEVE WHAT WE NEED IS CLEAR CONSISTENT GUIDELINES. AND STANDARDS THAT ARE SET STATEWIDE WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD POINT. WHICH IS BUT I STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO SET MINIMUM. STATEWIDE SAFETY AND ACCESS STANDARDS FOR OUR COURTS. I THINK WE HAVE TOO MUCH OF A DISJOINTED CHAOTIC DECENTRALIZED PROCESS I RECOGNIZE YOUR LOTS OF WAYS IN WHICH THAT CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS. BUT IN THIS INSTANCE IS JEOPARDIZING OUR SAFETY AND IT'S IN JEOPARDIZING. THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IF I WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD BE LOOKING TO THE CHEER COLORED SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE APPLY FOR MANY THINGS ACROSS COUNTIES AND I WOULD ASK PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS TO TELL ME WHAT LEVEL OF SAFETY IS APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF IN PERSON PROCEEDINGS. IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER PROTECTION SHOULD BE IN PLACE AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS THAT WE HAVE OF THAT COLOR TIERED SYSTEM. AND I WOULD MANDATE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE COURTS IN THAT RESPECT. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT THAT THERE IS OFTEN AND UNDERSTANDABLY. HESITANCY FROM A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO MANDATE THANKS TO THE JUDICIARY AND THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO TRY VERY CAREFULLY THERE. BUT USUAL COUNSELORS HAD THE AUTHORITY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC TO SET THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS. INDEED THEY HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL COURTS SOME HAVE SET STANDARDS SOME OF NOT INDIVIDUAL JUDGES UPSET SOME SOME HAVE NOT. IT'S A PATCHWORK THAT DOES NOT HAVE CONSISTENCY IT IS NOT KEEPING US SAFE IT IS NOT KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE IS NOT KEEPING LITIGANTS SAFE. IT IS NOT KEEPING MY LAWYERS ARE GOING INTO COURT WITH A STAFF FOR WORKING IMPORTS WERE JURORS SAY. IN A IN A CONSISTENT SYSTEMATIC WAY. SO WE NEED SOME STANDARDS THAT DO THAT WE DO NOT NEED THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T BELIEVE TO DICTATE EVERYTHING THE COURTS THERE'S LOTS OF ROOMS. THE ROOM FOR THE COURTS TO INNOVATE AND BE FLEXIBLE AND IT JUST IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT NEEDED. WHAT WE NEED A MINIMUM FLOOR WHEN WE SAY AT A MINIMUM. IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS. IN THIS YEAR YOU SHOULD NOT BE HAVING A IN PERSON. I'M THEY KNEW THESE. PUBLICLY HEALTH EXPERTS SAID GUIDELINES FOR WHAT YOU BE GOING ON. I BELIEVE THAT IF HAD THE- WE WOULD NOT BE HAVING ANY REMOTE. PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY ARE ALMOST NO REMOTE PROCEEDINGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WERE DRIVING WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING ON COURT ROOMS WE WILL ALL BE LOOKING AT A SYSTEM. LIKE THE ONE ALAMEDA HAS AT LEAST FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE I KNOW I SAID IN MY FINAL POINT IT'LL MAKE ONE MORE. WHICH IS THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT. OF COLLABORATIVE CREATIVE STUFF THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND THAT CAN BE A MODEL FOR WHAT WE DO. IN LOTS OF WAYS THAT CAN INCREASE AT CHRIS ACCESS YOU'VE HEARD FROM VARIOUS FOLKS. THAT THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT SOME OF THE STUFF WE'VE ALREADY DONE. CAN CAN CAN BUILD THE BEST THAT DIFFERENT WORLD IN A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS WE MOVE INTO THE AFTER TIMES. IF WE CAN DEAL WITH A BACKLOG IF WE CAN DEAL WITH THE OVERWHELMING. SCALE ISSUES THERE'S LOTS OF POSITIVE BEST PRACTICES THAT CAN COME OUT OF THIS THAT CAN MAKE US MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO INCREASE ACCESS. THAT CAN THAT CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PLUG IN ACCESS JUSTICE- THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING OUR COURTS BETTER IN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM IN MANY INSTANCES. WE NEED TO STATE KEEP THOSE ASPECTS OF THINGS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHAT WE NEED TO CORRECT. THE FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF SAFETY THAT IS STILL GOING ON AND TOO MANY OF OUR COURT ROOMS. AND SO AGAIN I REALLY CALL IN THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP INTO THAT VOID. YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE UP NORTH GENEVIEVE. EARLY LEADER FROM THEIR ILLEGAL EIGHT WHERE SHE SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS PUTTING IT TO THE COURTS. THE COURTS ARE LOOKING TO THE LEGISLATURE BACK TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING SOMEWHERE ELSE WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP STEP UP AND SAY. AT A MINIMUM HERE ARE SOME STANDARDS GOING TO INNOVATE ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ATTENTION AND BRINGING- BRINGING. ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK FOR JOINING US TO. VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR ALL RIGHT THOMAS RECORDED. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE AS HAS BEEN NOTED MY NAME IS DIEGO CAR TO HANNAH AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS PRESIDENT CEO GETS OUT OF LEGAL SERVICES. OUR AGENCY PROVIDE SERVICES TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN A WIDE ARRAY OF LEGAL ISSUES INCLUDING HOUSING TRAFFIC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ELDER ABUSE MATTERS WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR THERE FOR WITH THE IMPACT THAT CODE IS HAVING A WIDE CROSS SECTION OF WHAT AGAINST. I'D LIKE TO TELL THE STORY OF TWO DIFFERENT COURTS ONE IS THE DEPENDENCY COURT HERE IN LOS ANGELES. AND MONTEREY PARK TO BE PRECISE. AND THE OTHER IS THE STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE JUST UP A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILES AWAY. WHY THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE DEPENDENCY COURT. THE DEPENDENCY COURT ADDRESSES A VERY HIGH NUMBER OF URGENT. ON BEHALF OF A LITIGANT POPULATION SIMILAR TO WHAT IS SEEN IN OTHER COURTS THEY'RE OFTEN LOW INCOME LITIGANTS THERE OFTEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE CASE IS SEEN IN DEPENDENCY COURT- NOT UNLIKE THE MATTERS WE NEED AS A LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION HANDLES. HIGH STAKES MATTERS HIGH VOLUMES ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME LITIGANTS OF COLOR. WHEN FACED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND REALIZING THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GRANT ACCESS TO THE COURTS WHILE PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE DEPENDENCY COURT DECIDED IT WOULD MOVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS REMOTE ACCESS PLATFORM ACROSS ALL ITS COURTS. NAMELY THE WEB EXPORT PLATFORM. THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE THE COURT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PRESERVE HEALTH AND SAFETY. HOWEVER THEY DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF ENSURING COURT ACCESS AS A GOAL. TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO WEBEX THEY PURPOSEFULLY AND INTENTIONALLY CLOSED ALL BUT FOUR COURTS. WHAT OTHERS WERE BEING OUTFITTED WITH WEBEX. THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS WOULD CAUSE A BACKLOG BUT THEY ALSO WORK TO HAVE A PRIORITY LIST OF URGENT HEARINGS THAT WOULD STILL BE OUT. AND MANY OF THOSE MATTERS WERE HANDLED VIA STIPULATION. IF NOT BY REMOTE ACCESS THEM BY STIPULATION ULTIMATELY THEY HANDLED THREE THOUSAND CASES BY ELECTRONIC STIPULATION. AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ADOPTIONS HEARINGS I WISH THERE WERE HUNDREDS THAT WERE HANDLED REMOTELY DURING THE PANDEMIC. THOSE THREE THOUSAND MATTERS HANDLED BY STIPULATION OR HANDLED COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF THE COURT THEY WERE FILED. JUDGES REVIEWED AND SIGNED THE STIPULATIONS ALL WITHOUT A HEARING OR APPEARANCES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THESE STIPULATIONS OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF. ISSUE MERIT THAT IS TO SAY THEY DID NOT RESOLVE THE ENTIRE CASE BUT WERE ABLE TO NARROW DOWN THE ISSUES IN QUESTION. BY JUNE ALL DEPENDENCY COURTS WERE OUTFITTED WITH WEBEX. THEY HAVE NOW BEEN WORKING FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS ON A COMPLETELY REMOTE ACCESS STRUCTURE AND AS A RESULT THEY'RE HANDLING LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CASES EVERY WEEK USING WEBEX. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY OTHERS SPEAKERS THIS IS CARD IS BECAUSE SOME UNINTENDED BENEFITS. THE PERCENTAGE OF LITIGANTS WHO SHOW UP FOR HEARINGS HAVE INCREASE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL. AND THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE AS MUCH TIME OFF OF WORK TO GIVE JUST TWO EXAMPLES. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN STANLEY MOSK AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND. THIS IS NOT ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE THIS IS WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY JUST A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILES AWAY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE WE ARE SEEING WHAT AGAINST AND ATTORNEYS. BEING REQUIRED TO ATTEND COURT HEARINGS IN PERSON. REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE HEARING. FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS WHERE ATTORNEYS FOR MY OFFICE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO ATTEND VARIOUS UNLAWFUL DETAINER HEARINGS. IN PERSON. OR PERHAPS WE CAN GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE OTHER END OF THE COUNTY TO THE SANTA MONICA COURTHOUSE. THAT IS WHERE ATTORNEYS FROM OUR OFFICE. AND ATTORNEYS FROM OTHER OFFICES. INCLUDING MY OWN WIFE. ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND IN PERSON HEARINGS TO ADDRESS MINOR INFRACTIONS ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS. MINOR MATTERS LIKE A BROKEN WINDSHIELD. OUR DAUGHTER HAS LOST SLEEP WONDERING WHETHER HER MOTHER WILL COME BACK SICK FROM ATTENDING A COURT HEARING. SO AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED IT IS CRITICAL TO HAVE STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS POLICIES AND MEASURES THAT BALANCE BOTH ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME SIMPLE STEPS THAT ALL COURTS CAN TAKE YOUR INSURER ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND PRESERVE HEALTH AND SAFETY FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS TO COURTS COURTS MUST PROVIDE OPTIONS INCLUDING E. FILING EMAIL FAX AND DROP OFF IF NECESSARY. THESE OPTIONS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ALL MATTERS AND TO ALL INDIVIDUALS THIS IS A BOTH ATTORNEYS AND LITIGANTS. WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF COURTS WHERE DEFENSE BUT I APOLOGIZE PLAINTIFFS ARE ALLOWED TO EFILE AND DEFENDANTS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO FILE IN PERSON. IN ADDITION THE COURT MUST ELIMINATE DELAYS IN RETURN CONFORM COPIES. WHEN IT COMES TO FEE WAIVERS ALL FEES FOR REMOTE ACCESS SHOULD BE WAIVED WHEN A CLIENT IS ELIGIBLE. AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE ACCESS TO REMOTE ACCESS PLATFORMS ELECTRONIC FILING AND REVIEWING COURT DOCUMENTS THE WAIVERS SHOULD COVER THE LITIGANT THE LEGAL AID COUNSEL AND IF APPLICABLE PRO BONO COUNSEL. AND THESE WAIVER SHOULD COVER THIRD PARTY SEATS. AWEBER SHOULD BE GRANTED ON THE PAPERS AND IF THERE IS A QUESTION REGARDING A FEE WAIVER THE MATTER SHOULD BE SEPARATE HEARING NOT SIMPLY BOUNCED AND IF HEARING IS REQUIRED THE HEARING SHOULD BE HELD REMOTELY. WE ALSO NEED UNIFORM RULES REGARDING THE ACCEPTANCE OF E. SIGNATURES E. SIGNATURES MUST BE ACCEPTED BY ALL COURTS ON ALL MATTERS. AND THIS ROLE SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE WHIMS OF ANYONE INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL BENCH OFFICER OR COURT CLERK. IN SO FAR AS HEARINGS WE WOULD URGE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFORMED CLEAR POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE ALL PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING KOBE SAFETY. THIS ARTICLE MASS PHYSICAL DISTANCING. ADEQUATE AIR CIRCULATION AND- IN ALL OF THE COURTHOUSE AND IF THIS CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IT WOULD MEAN CLOSING COURTROOMS SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD INCLUDE PROVIDING A UNIFORM AND ACCESSIBLE PLATFORM FOR REMOTE APPEARANCES. SETTING SPECIFIC HEARING TIMES STAGGERING COURT CALENDARS ONLY SCHEDULING A NUMBER OF MATTERS THAT CAN BE CONDUCTED WALLEN'S FORCING PHYSICAL DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN EACH COURTROOM. ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES SO THAT PEOPLE WERE WAITING TO ENTER COURTROOM CAN MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND NOT GATHER IN LARGE GROUPS. WE REALIZE THAT THIS MAY CAUSE A DELAY IN HEARINGS BEING HELD HOWEVER WE CAN TRY TO ADDRESS THIS BY FOR EXAMPLE PRIORITIZING MATTERS. ADDRESS MATTER SUCH AS CASE HERE CASE MANAGEMENT HEARINGS OR TRIAL SETTINGS ON THE PAPERS OR BY STIPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE BROUGHT LOS ANGELES FAMILY COURT SERVICES OFFICE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS RATHER THAN REQUIRE IN PERSON OR EVEN REMOTE MEETINGS TO DISCUSS CáC AND VISITATION MATTERS THIS OFFICE SENSE FORMS JIM WOOD AGAINST. AND BASED ON THE RESPONSES PROVIDED BY THE LATE AGAINST IF THE PARTIES ARE ABLE TO SHOW SOME BASIS FOR AN AGREEMENT WHEN AN AGREEMENT IS WRITTEN UP IN ISSUE. THIS COMPLETELY ABOUT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR HEARING AND INDEED ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR THE COURT STAFF TO HOLD. A MEETING BETWEEN THE LITIGANTS. WHATEVER BEST PRACTICES ARE PROBLEMS. TO BE EFFECTIVE THE COURTS NEED TO HAVE REGULAR AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION AND MESSAGING. COURTS OFTEN RELY ON THEIR WEBSITES AND WE WOULD THEREFORE RECOMMEND FOLLOWING SOME COMMON BEST PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR WEBSITES. MINIMIZING TAX. FOLLOWING THE RULES CHAU NOT TELLING AND SIMPLE NAVIGATION. TRANSLATING THE WEBSITE INTO MOST COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE AREA AND NOT RELYING ON GOOGLE TRANSLATE OR OTHER MACHINE TRANSLATIONS. OPTIMIZING WEBSITES DESIGNSFOR USE ON MOBILE. PHONES AND OPTIMIZING WEBSITES FOR ACCESSIBILITY. AND NOTICES TO LITIGANTS MUST BE MODIFIED THEY MUST INCLUDE LANGUAGE REGARDING METHODS BY WHICH TO ACCESS THE COURT IN COURT HEARINGS AND THEY MUST DRAW ATTENTION TO LANGUAGE FOR EXAMPLE- USING DIFFERENT COLORED PAGES OR IMAGES THIS WAS A TOPIC THAT WAS DEPLOYED BY THE DEPENDENCY COURT. WHEN THEY ISSUED NEW NOTICES THEY PUT THESE NOTICES ON DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER. WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND FREQUENT TRAININGS FOR JUDICIAL OFFICERS STAFF AND ATTORNEY. FOR EXAMPLE THIS PAST DECEMBER BLACKBUCK PART IN THE L. A. COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION EXCUSE ME PARTNERED WITH THE FAMILY COURT TO PROVIDED TRAINING ON HOW TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND OR TRIAL REMOTELY. RECENTLY THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH THERE WAS A MEETING OF THE FAMILY LAW COALITION THIS IS A MONTHLY MEETING OF FAMILY LAW LEGAL SERVICES ADVOCATES AND THE COURTS WHERE THERE IS A BACK AND FORTH DISCUSSION ON HOW TO RESOLVE ISSUES AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES. AND FINALLY WE WOULD RECOMMEND ENGAGING IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH LEGAL AID AND OTHER PARTNERS TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND FORM PARTNERSHIPS. FOR EXAMPLE LEGAL AID OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING CREATING CHAOS WHERE OUR CLIENTS CAN ACCESS HEARINGS REMOTELY. AND THERE ARE THE LAW LIBRARY COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD REPRESENTATION AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM LEGAL AID. OR SELF HELP CENTERS THEY CAN SERVE AS A KEY RESOURCE BY PROVIDING CLASSES HELP WITH RESEARCH AND EVEN FREE CONSULTATIONS WITH VOLUNTEER ATTORNEYS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT MATTER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COURTS AND ALL OUR. PARTNERS I'M RESOLVING SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR BEING CLEAR WITH VERY GOOD TO. RIGHT MISTER DANIELS. GOOD HAVE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'LL TRY BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS DUE TO THE LOW OF THE- HEARING SO FAR- I WOULD TO- COMMENT THAT EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL OF SAID I AGREE WITH. THAT I WILL NOT WE STATE THAT- AS WELL. WELL I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA COUNCIL PRIOR TO THAT I SAY SERVED AS PER. OF THE ALSO DEFINES OF MONICA NEVADA I BEEN PRACTICING I THINK THIS IS MY TWO YEAR IN FACT SENATOR WHY KASKI YOU MAY KNOW MY MAN CARE WHITE HOUSE THE WHO I WORK FOR BACK IN. NINETEEN NINETY THREE- BECAUSE OF THAT LET. I'VE BEEN TO APPEAR IN THE IF NOT ALL OF THE- IN THE COUNTY SPUR COURT ALL FIFTY EIGHT. IN THERE IS WIDE DISPARITY THERE ALWAYS WILL BE AWAY SPIRIT. FROM TO. WHEN YOU'VE GOT IT ALL COME JUDGES A MODOC COUNTY THE OR- VERSUS TO EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY OUR STUDENTS FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY. JUDGES IN L. A. COUNTY IT'S JUST GONNA BE DEBT. BUT THAT. MEAN WE SHOULDN'T TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME WITH SOME UNIFORM WHEN IT COMES TO. ACCESS TO THE COURTS IN THE REMOTE. SYSTEM THAT THE L. A. COUNTY IS. I THINK THAT THAT IS A SPEECH GREAT. THAT WE CAN YOU. OUR OWN. THAT TO FOLLOW TO SET UP IN THE- OTHER CASE. IN PREPARATION FOR MY TEST MY TODAY I. SOME JUDGE THAT ARE COLLEAGUES OF IN SHASTA. L. A. COUNTY DIEGO COUNTY SACRAMENTO ON FOSTER- WHERE I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME. LITIGATING AND- THEY UNIFORMLY TOLD ME THEY'RE BUSIER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. SO IF THERE'S ANY NOTION THAT THE JUDGES AND THE COURTS ARE NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF COURT CLOSURES. AT THE THAT'S THE- IT TO STAY LEGAL TERM AT HOGWARTS. WELL THEY ALL FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THE LITTLE DUTCH BOY WHO'S TRYING SAVE THE DAY BY STICKING A FINGER IN THE DIKE. IN THERE WAITING FOR- THAT DAY TO BREAK AND I THINK GONNA. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO. MOVE FOR WITH A PLAN A STRONG PLAN TO GET THESE CASES MOVED ALONG. I WOULD LIKE TO SPLIT. MY TESTIMONY TO AIR. THE PREACHER. LITIGATION OF. AND THEN THE TRIAL OF MATTERS SUPER COURTS. JUST AT EIGHT THIRTY I LONG COUNTY ON A- RESTRAINING ORDER YEAH I WISH I THE CAMERA TEMPORARY ORDERS WERE ISSUED J. IN THIS WAS FOR THE PERMANENT. WE DID IT WE IN WAS SEEN EIGHT EIGHT THE ALL THE PARTIES WERE PRESS WE ALL SEE EACH OTHER AT WHOLE TIME- THE JUDGE WILL ON TIME HE SAID BASICALLY THREE MAIN ON HALF HOUR. YEAH MANAGE WERE POST ON THE- ONLINE I THAT THAT EVERY TIME SHE BE REQUIRED TO HAVE AND I DOT SO THAT WE HAVE ACCESS WHAT'S ON IN COURTS OF DAY. HE HAD THREE MATTER OF THE THIRD THREE MATTER NINE THREE MINUTES NINE THREE. IN MY MATTER WAS ACTUALLY SO AT NINE WE STARTED AT NINE OO. THAT'S INCREDIBLE IT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ROLE ACCESS I CAN'T SAY HOW MANY TO WHEN I WOULD BE HOURS. BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE WE'RE LARA AND WE WERE NOT GETTING THINGS FOR ON A TINY BASE. SO I THINK FROM FREE TROUBLE STAND. ONE HUNDRED REMOTE TO THE COURTS. IS A THING I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME UNIFORMS RULES ON THAT. I THINK THAT THOSE LITIGANTS WHO- CANNOT ACCESS TO REMOTE HEARINGS THAT MADE WE SEE SOMETHING UP WITH HIS AND THAT THE JUDGE MELANIE COUNTY SAID. GIVEN SO THAT THEY- HAVE A TO EQUAL I. ALBUM UP TO COURT ROOM THEM SAY IN IN IN IN THE G. DELIVER. IN FOR OF A VIDEO CONFERENCE SINCE THEN IT ASK APPEAR- SO THERE ARE TO LOSE TO THE OF APPEARANCE HOMES THAT WE HAVE. WE THINK THE- DOES NAMES PRACTICE IN THE LITIGANT- PRACTICE PRACTITIONERS. NEED MAY WANT TO CONSIDER GOING TO A NINE PANEL JURY INSTEAD OF THE TWELVE- I WOULD NOT HOWEVER WANT THAT TO BE FORCED UPON ME AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY. I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE A LEFT IN WE SHOULD HAVE SOME LEGISLATION THAT SAYS THAT. IF THE PARTY STIPULATE TO NINE- JURIST OR IF THE PARTY STIPULATE. THAT TO SOME OTHER. POLKA TRIAL AND CHIP AWAY THAT WE CARRY THE BILL DON'T CASE FORWARD. AT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A WELL. ON. WE SEE HERE. WELL I ALSO THAT WE TRY TO STRIVE TO HAVE A SINGLE TO. PLATFORM GOING- I DO PRACTICING LAW ENOUGH WHERE THE WE HAD EVERYTHING DONE PERSON AND THEN WE WILL TO COURT CALL. COURT CALL WAS. WE FANTASTIC I NO LONGER HAD TO TAKE THAT THAT UP TO WHAT COUNTY. OR FLY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO FOR A HOUR. WITH COST ME MY CLIENT. THE FULL TIME AND MONEY TO HAVE MY HEARD. ABOUT NOW. COURT CALL WE'RE WE'RE NOW DOWN INTERIM ACCESS TO THE- I THINK THAT A YEAR FROM NOW FOR YEARS AND TEN FROM NOW. WE AS THE JUDICIAL NEED TO STAY UP WITH THE- INCOME WITH A PLAN WE HAVE A SINGLE PLAY. FOR ALL WHO TO USE THE SAME. THE INCIDENT BE TEAMS THAT MARK TEAMS WHATEVER BE- BUT AFTER WE GOT A HAVE YOU TO. THERE WELL. WITHOUT REACH WHAT MIGHT COLLEAGUES I WILL LET ME LEAVE BACK TO YOU- NO WORRIES JUST LITTLE IN OUR HOUSE. RIVALRY'S ALL RIGHT MISS CALDWELL. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHELLE CALDWELL AND I'M AN OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AND A MEMBER OF SEIU I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A PART OF THIS PROFESSION SINCE I WAS A LICENSED BY THE COURT REPORTERS PORED OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAS AUTHORIZED BY AB TWO FIFTY THREE TO CONDUCT A REMOTE COURT REPORTING PILOT PROJECT THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE PILOT TO BE CONDUCTED IN LIMITED COURT ROOMS DURING CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND ENDED THIS PAST DECEMBER. THE POINT OF THE PILOT WHICH PASSED PRETTY COVE IT WAS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF COURT REPORTER APPEARING THE COURT REPORTER APPEARING REMOTELY IN A COURTROOM IN FULL EVERY DAY IN PERSON THREE KOPET OPERATIONS OUR FIRST TEST WAS IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT HAD CHALLENGES IT WAS A SINGLE CAMERA AND THE ANGLE WASN'T ENOUGH FOR REPORTER TO DIFFERENTIATE EVEN WHO WAS SPEAKING. THE SOUND WAS TENNEY AND IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE BUT OUR I. T. DIVISION WENT TO WORK RIGHT AWAY TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES BUT IT WAS JUST A WEEK LATER WHEN MOST COURTROOMS- IN OUR COUNTY JUST LIKE STATEWIDE SHUTDOWN OVER COATED AND THE TESTING WAS STOPPED SO WHAT WE DID RESUME TESTING LATER IN THE FALL IT WAS UNDER REMOTE APPEARANCES AND KOBE CONDITIONS. PEOPLE MASSED AND WHATNOT. BUT WE'RE AB TWO FIVE THREE ONE OFF THEIR OF THE INTO. SO OF PICKED. AND I SAY SORT OF BECAUSE THE TYPE OF REMOTE REPORTING MY COLLEAGUES AND I DO NOWADAYS. DOES NOT RESEMBLE WHAT AB TWO FIFTY THREE ENVISIONED CREE COVE IT. AB TWO FIFTY THREE ENVISIONED EVERYONE IN THE COURTROOM EXCEPT THE REPORTER AND THAT'S NOT HOW WE CONDUCT BUSINESS NOWADAYS AS YOU ALL KNOW. IN FACT TO THAT END AB TWO FIFTY THREE HAS NEVER BEEN TRULY TESTED BUT FOR THOSE TWO DAYS NEARLY A YEAR AGO. ULTIMATELY IS THE REMOTE SYSTEM GOOD ENOUGH. PERHAPS IT IS. BUT EVEN IF WE CAN GET TO GOOD ENOUGH WE HAVE TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PART OF THE ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING A RECORD. AND THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH GOOD ENOUGH. ORDERS ROLE IN THIS BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT ISN'T JUST TO BE GOOD ENOUGH GUARDINS OF THE RECORD. OUR REPORTERS ROLE IS TO BE THE GUARDIANS OF HISTORY. IF IT IS SET IN A COURTROOM AND A REPORTER DOESN'T HEAR IT OR DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. AND CAN'T SPEAK UP TO INTERRUPT AND GET IT RIGHT.IT'S GONE FOREVER IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND IT'S NO LONGER PART OF HISTORY. IT CAN'T BE REVIEWED OR ANALYZE OR BE PROCESSED THROUGH ANY FORM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. IT JUST ISN'T OUR PROFESSION. THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD LICENSING AGENCY OF EVERY CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTER WILL TELL US THAT MUCH. ONE CAN LISTEN TO AN ARGUMENT WITH INTERRUPTED CONNECTIONS ARE OUTSIDE NOISE AND DISTRACTIONS. AND GET THE GIST OF WHAT SOMEONE SAYING EXACTLY LIKE ELECTRONIC RECORDING DOES. AND A CORD INJURY CAN EVEN MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THAT INCOMPLETE RECORD. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THAT END RESULT IS ULTIMATELY INCONSEQUENTIAL. HOW THE COURT OR JURY GOT TO THAT END RESULT IS ULTIMATELY WHAT MATTERS. THE CONTENT ISWHAT MATTERS AND THAT'S WHAT THE RECORD FROM THOSE COURTROOM HISTORIANS THE COURT REPORTERS. BECOMES INVALUABLE. THERE IS NO APPEAL NO JUST JUDICIAL REVIEW WITHOUT AN ACCURATE RECORD OF HOW CORD INJURY GOT TO THE END RESULT. IF WE MERELY WANTED A SYNOPSIS OF THE DAY'S EVENTS WE HAVE MINUTE ORDERS FOR THAT. AND WHERE ARE OUR STANDARDS IN THE COURT ROOM THREE CODED THERE WAS ABSOLUTE AND NECESSARY COURTROOM PROTOCOL. BUT NOW NOT. YES THEIR GUIDELINES AND SUGGESTIONS AND BEST PRACTICES BUT A RECORD IS A RECORD AND DOESN'T CHANGE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. MY COLLEAGUES STATEWIDE ARE WORKING UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES EVERY SINGLE DAY. LITIGANTS LAWYERS AND JUSTICE PARTNERS ARE CALLING IN AND PARTICIPATING IN COURT PROCEEDINGS. ON CELL PHONES FROM THEIR CARS IN TRAFFIC WITH OPEN MIKES FROM RESTAURANTS GROCERY STORES SUMMER LYING IN BED ORDERING FOOD IN A DRIVE THROUGH LAUNCHING A BOAT. ARE BEING SEEN AN EMERGENCY ROOM THE LIST OF OPEN MIKE SCENARIOS GOES ON. IT DOES NOT REMOTELY RESEMBLE THE ORDER OF EVEN THIS HEARING. NOT EVEN CLOSE IN MANY MANY COURTROOM STATEWIDE BE OUTSIDE INTERFERENCES MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE AND KEEP A RECORD. AND SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO ACCESS AT ALL ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK EVERY AFTERNOON AND ONE PARTICULAR COURT THE STATE ANNOUNCEMENT PLAYS LOUDLY QUOTE YOUR SESSION HAS ENDED GOODBYE. LITIGANTS VICTIMS ADVOCATES AND THE PUBLIC ARE DROPPED FROM THE CALL COURT JUST CONTINUES AND NO ONE BATS AN EYE OR WE CAN ACCESS. AND MANY CALLERS HAVE NO CAMERAS IF A REPORTER CAN'T SEE AMOUNTS MOVING HERE SHE CAN'T ALWAYS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SIMILAR WORDS LIKE FIFTY OR FIFTEEN NON STATION MATTERS. AND SO IT'S A REPORTERS RESPONSIBILITY TO INTERRUPT. BUT TRUTH BE TOLD THE PATIENCE OF THE SYSTEM IS WEARING THIN IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR. TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGY IS OFTEN NONEXISTENT AND JUDICIAL FATIGUE IS A REAL THING BUT THEIR CALENDARS TO GET THROUGH BACK WELL TO CLEAR OUT OF AS WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT TODAY. AND SO JUDICIAL OFFICERS HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO DIRECT REPORTERS NOT TO INTERRUPT. ONE JUDICIAL OFFICER NOTING THE RECORD DURING JURY SELECTION THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE A BIT OF DISRUPTION TO ALLOW THE REPORTER TO INTERRUPTING OVER THINGS THAT ARE QUOTE NOT PARTICULARLY CONSEQUENTIAL. WHAT IS CONSEQUENTIAL AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED WHAT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL ARE NOT RECORDER BORDERS CALL. HISTORY AND APPELLATE COURTS GET TO MAKE THAT CALL NOT A REPORTER. OUR PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND IN FACT STATUTORY AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS REQUIRE THE REPORTERS MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO MAKE ARRESTS RECORD AS IT'S HAPPENING. NOT TO CREATE ONE LATER FROM THE CHEST OF A PROCEEDING. THE WORDS INAUDIBLE AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ARE NOT OPTIONS AS CERTIFIED TRANSCRIPT THOSE WORDS THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD DOESN'T RECOGNIZE AND DOES NOT ALLOW US LICENSE YOU REPORTERS TO USE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE FROM ONE TRIAL COURT BUT COURT ROOM STATEWIDE ARE REPLETE WITH EXAMPLES JUST LIKE THAT. INCLUDING A WAVE OFF FROM A JUDGE ONE REPORTER SAYS HERE SHE CAN'T HEAR OR SIMPLY IGNORING A MUTED MIKE FROM A TALKING ATTORNEY OR LITIGANT AND MOVING ON WITH CASES. THESE THINGS HAPPEN EVERY DAY. LET ME TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MY COLLEAGUE STATEWIDE AND I ARE WORKING. AND HAVE BEEN SINCE THE REST OF THE STATE WANTED TO SHUT DOWN IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. REPORTERS IN THE COURTROOM ARE EXPOSED TO LITIGANTS IN CUSTODY AND OTHERWISE WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM. THEY'RE OFTEN STICK EXPOSED ON MASTER IMPROPERLY MASKED. AND THERE IS LITTLE MASK OR DISTANCING ENFORCEMENT FROM THE BENCH COURT SECURITY OFFICER OR OTHERWISE. SOMETIMES MINUTES MAYBE HOURS AND PLEXIGLAS IS A FINANCIAL LUXURY NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL PROGRAMS. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM THEIR WORKPLACES MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO TAKE PAID TIME OFF EVEN AFTER THEY WERE DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS AT WORK. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOT BEEN VACCINATED AND BUT FOR A FEW SELECT REGIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE. BUT MANY COURTS ARE GETTING IT RIGHT SOME COUNTIES- CONTINUE TO PAY FOR PAID LEAVE TO EMPLOYEES WHO NEED TO QUARANTINE. OTHERS DO NOT. SOME IS HERE TO STRIP DISTANCING AND SANITIZING AND HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY AND OTHERS NOT. SOME I PARTNERED WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE COURT FAMILY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION IN THESE DANGEROUS AND SCARY TIMES. AND OTHERS WOULD NORTH PLEASE WORKERS. ON BEHALF OF MY PROFESSION MY COLLEAGUES WE URGE THE ADOPTION OF SYSTEM WIDE PROTOCOLS TO HELP ENSURE THE SAFETY OF COURT WORKERS. AND TO ENSURE ACCURACY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE RECORD. BORDERS ALONG WITH THIS YEAH YOU WELCOME AND REQUEST TO SEE IF THAT DECISION MAKING TABLE AND ARE EAGER TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE DO AGREE THAT REMOTE COURTROOMS CAN BE A VIABLE STANDARD FOR THE FUTURE BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCES WITHIN OUR INDIVIDUAL COURTROOMS. IS SWITCH OUT PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO COURT WORKER SAFETY AND THE PROTECTION OF THE RECORD. GOOD ENOUGH JUST ISN'T ALWAYS GOOD ENOUGH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN IT IS INTERESTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PROJECT FOR REMOTE REPORT COURT REPORTERS AND THEN SEE HOW THAT WAS. AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AT I THINK IT'S REALLY RAISED A LOT OF ISSUES. WRITER ARE FEEDING FINAL SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL IS JUDGE YOU HOUSE. AND MUCH OF SENATOR UMBERG INITIAL NUMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER STRONG FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE- I'VE BEEN WORKING THIS AFTERNOON CUTTING DOWN MY REMARKS SO I UNDERSTAND ON THE FINAL HOLD OUT HERE AND I'M GONNA MAKE THEM- AS QUICK AS I CAN- I'M THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMMISSION FOR CALIFORNIA- I'M ALSO A FAMILY LAW JUDGE ARE HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'M NOT HERE ON BEHALF OF EITHER THE BRANCH FOR ALL OF LOS ANGELES. COUNTY HOWEVER I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE A COURTROOM WE'VE NOT TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE FACT IT WELL ALL OF THIS IS BEEN GOING ON. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS BEEN CONTINUING TO WORK ON FORMS AND RULES- THAT ARE PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE VARIOUS LITIGANTS SHOP I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT THERE'S MORE TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH DOWN WHAT OCCURS INSIDE OF A CORK ON THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMMISSION HAS WORKED FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TO LOWER OBSTACLES TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATE AND THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE WITH A STAKE IN THESE ISSUES OF OUR COMMISSIONERS FOR LAWYERS JUDGES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS I'M I THINK IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO DO TWO THINGS CONCURRENTLY. ONE WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE MANY CHANGES WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT I'M ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WHICH OF THE EMERGENCY CHANGES THAT HEARD ARE WE'RE GOING TO REJECT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND SECONDLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABLE CRISIS WHETHER IT'S FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS. OR HUNDRED YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- ACCOMPANYING SECURING ISN'T. AN EXCELLENT. PAPER IN THE- SUCH. OF SERVE ACTUALLY CONSIDER. THE COURTS MUST INTO CAN. I'M I'M LIKE TO. MAKES SUGGESTIONS HOW THE COMING. WORK TO ASSIST CAL. I THINK EVERYONE TESTIFIED TODAY- NO THE IMPORT. OF VIRTUAL APPEARANCES APPEARANCES AND WITH A HOLD GREAT PROMISE FOR ACCESS. WEST MAIN ACCESSED COMMISSION ISSUED A FOR COURTS ON TO JUSTICE ISSUES ARE THAT THE REMOTE HEARINGS POST JUDGES AND COURT STAFF SURGEON REMARKABLE JOB. INCLUDING SOME OF THESE CHANGES AND AFTER THE VICTIM DIMMOCK THERE IS NO DOUBT THE COURTS WILL NOT AND FRANKLY CANNOT SIMPLY RETURN TO THE BUSINESS AS USUAL. RECORDS NEED SUPPORT TO REDUCE EXPECTS TECH TONIC TECHNOLOGY SHIFT AND SINCE THE SHIFT OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN BOTH EXPENSIVE. AND CHALLENGING. THE MOST ACUTE ACCESSING AFFECT WHO CAN'T THE MOST OF ACCESS ISSUES OF PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD LAW. I'M THESE ARE MANY OF THIS PEOPLE WERE MY LIKELY BEEN UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN REMOTE HEARINGS BECAUSE THEY LACK THE REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT- WELL MANY PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. HOW RELIABLE BANDWIDTH I'M AT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT. MANY OF OUR PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE RURAL AND OTHER AREAS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY- BAND WITH THEY DON'T HAVE THE BASIC TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S REQUIRED ON THE ACCESS CONNECTION IS WORKING ON A MODEL PROGRAM JUST SET UP A REMOTE HEARING ACCESS SITES. THESE WILL BE PLACES THAT OFFER ONLINE ACCESS A COMPUTER TERMINAL A CAMERA MICROPHONE PRINTER. AND A SCANNER IN A PRIVATE SECURE AND COVERT NINETEEN SHOULD ASK ENTER A LOCATION THE SUCH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE IN THE NUMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAS. NEEDS REMOTE. COURT ACCESS. FOR TO GET INTO COURT. TO MEET THE ROLE THE NEW IN RURAL AREAS WE ARE UNDERTAKING WORK WITH AID TOURIST FROM HEARING. THE CRITICAL OF K. LAW LIBRARY AREN'T DIRECTIONAL LOCATION LIBRARIES AS HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTICED- ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND HAVE PROVIDED SAFE RELIABLE ACCESS FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS FOR MANY YEARS WE ALSO HOPE TO WORK WITH SUPERIOR COURTS CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE OTHER LIBRARIES AMONG OTHERS ABOUT OTHER POTENTIAL LOCATIONS. WE WILL NEED TO ESTABLISH A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE LOCATIONS ARE WITH EVERY ADEQUATE ADVERTISING TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THEY EXIST FOR MAKING SENTIMENTAL STATEWIDE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT BUT WE HOPE TO DEMONSTRATE IN THESE REMOTE HEARING SUCH HELP NARROW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ALLOW ACCESS TO THOSE CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE. EASY ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. ARE WE ALL KNOW THAT IS THE- ELECTION MONITORING BEGINS THE COURTS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FACE AND US. CASE THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN CRITICAL STEPS TO PM. OF THESE CORPORATE BASED ECONOMIC ABOVE THE CORPORATE BASED. CRISIS ON BOTH WINTERS LANDLORDS. HOWEVER MANY COURTS IN LARGE URBAN AREAS HAVE STARTED MEDIATION PROGRAMS FROM LAWFUL DETAINER CASES IT'S EVERYTHING EVERYBODY'S BEST INTERESTS TO SETTLE AS MANY CASES AS WE CAN- MANY COURTS DON'T HAVE THESE MEDIATION PROGRAMS. SO WHILE MEDIATION USING REMOTE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE EFFECTIVE AGAIN ALSO POSES SOME OF THE MANY CHALLENGES THAT REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE THERE ARE DISCUSSED WITH REMOTE COURT PROCEEDINGS. YEAH THIS COMMISSION IS WORKING ON THREE PROJECTS TO HELP COURTS WITH THESE- MEDIATION REMOTE MEDIATION POSSIBILITIES. ONE PROVIDING VIRTUAL TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR MEDIATORS TAUGHT BY VERY EXPERIENCED VERY EXPERIENCED MEDIATORS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE IN FICTION DISPUTES IN THE LANDSCAPE. TO WORKING WITH ONE OR MORE SUPERIOR COURTS TO ESTABLISH NEW MEDIATION PROGRAMS WERE EXPLORING MEDIAN IN THOSE CASES PERHAPS A DAY OR TWO IN ADVANCE OF BEFORE THE COURT DATE WHICH GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE TO PLAN ON TAKING TIME OFF OF WORK SHORT AS THAT MAY BE A BIT ALSO CAN ADDRESSES POTENTIAL CALENDAR- CROWDING AS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY GET PEOPLE ARE RESOLVED AND OFF THE DOCKET BEFORE THE NEEDS TO COME INTO COURT. EVEN FOR DIFFERENT. VIRTUALLY REMOTE. WE DON'T LIKE TO SEE PROVIDE ORGAN. AND BARS CA. ORGANIZED AND COACHING FOR LITTLE. BOTH TEN AND LANDLORDS. WILL HAVE PART IN SMALL PRESS. ABOUT BACKGROUND CARDS I'M COOPER NINETEEN HAS EXPONENTIALLY WORSENED PROBLEMS WITH EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CHILD CARE AND HEALTH CARE. PUBLIC SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE BUT OFTEN IT TAKES KNOWLEDGEABLE RESOURCES AND ACTIONS AND MANEUVERING TO GET THAT HELP. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDED FOR RATE REDUCTIONS BUT ONLY FOR WINTER FILLS OUT THE RIGHT FORMS AT THE RIGHT TIMES CIVIL LEGAL AID PROGRAMS PLAN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ROLE. IN ASSISTING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SENIORS DISABLED VETERANS AND OTHERS IN OBTAINING THE HELP THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED. MANY PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS OR HAVING HOURS CUT BACK. WORKERS CAN GET HELP FROM LEGAL AID PROGRAMS AND OTHER TARGETED PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE EQUAL ACCESS FUND GRANTS A LEGAL SERVICES TRUST FUND TO PROCEEDS. FROM INTEREST ON LAWYERS TRUST FUNDS OR IOTA FUNDS. FEDERAL AND STATE COVERED NINETEEN ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE BUT IS DIRECTLY AVAILABLE CAN DEPEND ON GETTING LEGAL HELP AT THE RIGHT TIME WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THE DEBIT CARDS WITH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS GO ASTRAY.
