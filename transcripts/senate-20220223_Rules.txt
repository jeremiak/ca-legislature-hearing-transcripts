THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR. THANK FOR- OPPORTUNITY- TO MEET OUR I APPRECIATED IT I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT CAME OUT OF OUR CONVERSATION. AND ONE OF THEM WAS. I ASKED YOU- SINCE YOU HAD HAD MOST OF YOUR CAREER OUT OF STATE AND WE'RE COMING IN TO CALIFORNIA. OR WHAT IT WAS LIKE AND HOW YOU EXPECTED TO COMPENSATE FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE LEARNING CALIFORNIA PROCESSES AND CALIFORNIA RELATIONSHIPS- IN YOUR JOB. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- AND IT WAS WONDERFUL MEETING WITH YOU AS WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY- YESTERDAY. THAT IS SO WE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW COMING UP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SERVING AS A PUBLIC SERVANT NOW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE EXPERIENCES OF WORKING IN GOVERNMENT ARE VERY SIMILAR SO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN ADMINISTERING THE A LARGE AGENCY ARE NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM ADMINISTERING A LARGE FEDERAL AGENCY. AND SO IN THAT SENSE I FEEL LIKE I CAME VERY PREPARED AND READY AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO JUMP IN VERY QUICKLY TO THE ISSUES AND TO PRIORITIZE SEEN WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS. IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP THE AREAS WHERE I COME UP WITH A BIT OF A DISADVANTAGE. I YOU KNOW I YOU NATURALLY OF A RELATIONSHIP BUILDER I FEEL THAT IT IS MY JOB TO. BREAK DOWN SILOS ASSURE THAT I'M WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE OTHER SECRETARIES. TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SENATE AND WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH ON THE EMPLOYER SIDE AND THAT THE WORKER SIDE. AND SO I HAVE BEEN FOCUSING QUITE A BIT OF MY TIME ON BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND GETTING OUT THERE ARE TO OUR LOCAL AREAS AND GETTING TO KNOW WHAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC CHALLENGES ARE AS WE COME OUT OF COLLUDED. AND ENTER. THIS NEW PHASE OF RECOVERY. GRAY THANK YOU I PREFER THAT THE OTHER A I THOUGHT ARE ASK YOU. A WE TALK. YESTERDAY ABOUT. I COUNT ABILITY MEASUREMENT SO THAT YOU HAVE A WAY OF ASSESSING. THE WORK YOU DO AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT IS AND IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THAT SO WE WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT TO HOLD ACCOUNTABILITY IN YOUR POSITION THAT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IT IS ONE THAT CAME UP. IN MANY OF MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ONE OF MY KEY AREAS OF FOCUS DURING MY PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER HAS BEEN THE YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR POLICYMAKERS SO NOT ONLY FOCUSING ON THE POLICIES THAT MAKE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT ALSO ON HOW WELL GOVERNMENT OPERATES HOW IS CONTINUES WE IMPROVING ANY INNOVATIVE. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVES. AND SO MY GOAL HERE- THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IS TO BRING MY EXPERIENCES. FROM MY FEDERAL SERVICE YEARS AND TO IMPLEMENT MORE A MORE ROBUST STRUCTURE AROUND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND EVIDENCE BUILDING. SO THAT WE MAY BE DEMONSTRATING TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE VALUE THAT WE OFFER. AND THAT WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY PRIORITISING AND MEASURING OURSELVES AGAINST THOSE PRIORITIES PRIORITIES. GREAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED MAN VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SECRETARY WE DID HAVE A VERY NICE VISIT YESTERDAY I WAS ABLE TO SQUEEZE YOU IN ACTUALLY PASS YOUR DINNER TIME AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD KIDS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE WAITING FOR THAT SO. THAT TIME LET ME SAY JUST OFF THE TOP- THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE PRIVATE ACTION- HOW THE ISSUE KNOWING YOU YOU DID NOT EXPERIENCE THAT INTO YOU CAME TO CALIFORNIA. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU BE OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME OF THE REFORMS THAT. ARE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE NECESSARY FOR PROTECTING AND IN PARTICULAR I THINK ALL THE FOCUS WAS ON. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SO I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT YOU HAVE. AN OPEN MIND AND GO WE'LL TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THAT IF INFORMATION COMES FORWARD AND YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATORS I APPRECIATED THAT. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT BUILD ON OUR- VERY ODD. INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION YESTERDAY AND I WONDER IF THE CLAIMS PROCESSING- WE DID RUN INTO ISSUES WITHOUT. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM THERE WERE MANY THINGS AWAY IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. SO THE QUESTION IS- HELLO- HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE SURE THAT WAS STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE SB I IF IT'S USING THE SAME COMPUTER PROCESSOR. THAT WE WON'T START TO RUN INTO SOME SIGNIFICANT. FRAUD ISSUES THERE AND I KNOW A FEWHAVE MEMBERS NOT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH YOUR A. B. THAT COULD YOU SHARE A LIBERATE CONVEYED YOU DID RESPOND TO THAT BUT- ABURRIDA LITTLE. ON THE PUBLIC RECORD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. ALSO SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION FRAUD IS NO FRAUD OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM HERE IN OUR STATE AND ACROSS. ALL OF OUR STATE. HAS BEEN TOP OF MIND FOR MANY. AND AS WE KNOW IDENTITY FRAUD IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST VULNERABILITIES THAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY TODAY UNFORTUNATELY. AND THE PANDEMIC ON COVERED A LOT OF THIS HERE IN OUR STATE WITH OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. AND THE PROCESSING. THERE ARE FOUR KEY ACTIONS THAT WE TALK DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO REVISE AND REVIEW CURRENTLY- TO COMBAT FRAUD. THE FIRST ONE WAS EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WE CONTRACTED WITH THOMSON REUTERS TO PROVIDE. US SOME DATA ANALYSIS AND FILTERS THAT WE COULD USE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. THAT PROCESS EVOLVED OVER TIME NOT SO THOSE FILTERS HAVE EVOLVED AND THEY ARE STILL IN PLACE AND THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING FRAUD THAT ISN'T ALWAYS IDENTITY FRAUD COULD BE OUT OF STATE FRAUD THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRAUD THAT THESE FILTERS HELP US IDENTIFY. THE SECOND IS A TOOL IT'S A TECHNOLOGY TOOL THAT MANY AGENCIES HAVE STARTED TO USE BOTH IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS IT NEED. SO I DO NEED IS FOCUSED ON THE FRONT END TO OUR VERIFY IDENTITIES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. SUBMITTING CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND SO THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY. CONTROL LEVELS OF FRAUD OF. THE THIRD. LARGE PIECE IS THAT THE- EDT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER A FRAUD A UNITS SO THIS IS A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE ASSESSING. THE ANALYTICS THE DATA AROUND OUR CLAIMS TRYING TO STAY AHEAD AND NOT BE REACTIVE TO NEW ATTACKS OF FRAUD. AND FOURTH BOB VERY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH FORMER U. S. ATTORNEY MCGREGOR SCOTT AND HIS ROLE HAS BEEN TO HELP US MOVE FRAUDULENT- OF. EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD INTO THE HANDS OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE PROSECUTED. SO THAT IS ON THE BACK AND THE ACTUAL PROSECUTION OF THE CRIMINAL FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING DOMESTICALLY AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY. AND SO IN TERMS OF D. II WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. WE ARE THESE OF SORTS OF FEATURES ARE NOT IN PLACE OUR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE TO FRAUD AND SO WE HAVE A LOOK AT OUR BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION. SYSTEMS BUT DISABILITY INSURANCE IS ONE OF THEM AND WE ARE. IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THESE PIECES INTO THE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO VERY VULNERABLE TO THESE SORTS OF IDENTITY THEFT FRAUD- I WOULD OF COURSE YOU KNOW WANT TO STATE THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING AND ASSESSING WHAT FRAUD LOOKS LIKE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED TO PUT NEW TOOLS IN PLACE OR YOU KNOW WE THINK OUR STRATEGIES WE ARE DOING SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN REAL TIME SO THAT WE'RE NOT BEHIND THE CURVE. GREAT ANSWER AND APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE THINKING OF THE PRESIDENT AND THEN. TAKING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED I GUESS INTO THE FUTURE. THERE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE REYES THAT THE VISUAL ARTS. RECOGNITION CONDIT- I THINK GOING FORWARD. CREATE SOME PRIVACY ISSUES I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE VERY OUT WITH. HAVING SOME SORT OF CHALLENGE ON THAT BUT IT JUST IT'S VERY VERY RECENT THAT HAS EMERGED BECAUSE IT'S BEING USED MORE. SO ANY THOUGHT FOUND OUT WHY NO WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THAT THAT TIME HAVE YOU HAD A JOB FROM- I GIVEN THE ISSUES RAISED ON OUT ALREADY. YES I'VE SENATOR AND WE ARE WORKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS OTHER STATES AND LOOKING AT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING WHEN IT COMES TO ID ME AND THE FACIAL RECOGNITION TOOL. THAT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE A SELFIE- AND- AND SO THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CAN QUICKLY CROSS REFERENCE THAT ADDITIONAL IDENTIFICATION WITH OTHER FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION. ARE WE ARE ASSESSING CURRENTLY OUT WHETHER WE WANT TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE IRS HAS MOVED WHICH IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING OPTIONALITY FOR USERS OF ID ME. WHERE THEY CAN CHOOSE TO CONTINUE WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO OPT INTO THAT AND THERE WILL BE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF VERIFYING IDENTITY WHICH IS WITH A LIVE INTERMEDIARY. THAT COMES ON AND- VERIFIES THE IDENTITY OF THE PERFECT PERSON WITHOUT A SELFIE HAVING TO BE TAKEN. INTEREST WE ARE EVALUATING CURRENTLY ASSESSING THOSE OPTIONS. AND IRIS IS USING THAT INTERESTING. LAST QUESTION I THINK WE DID DISCUSS THIS BECAUSE IT'S VERY. CONCERNING TO YOU AGAIN OUR TO OUR SMALLER BUSINESSES THE UNIT. THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND OUT TO HAND OUT YOU WITH HUGE WITH THE GREAT RECESSION TOOK A DECADE TO RETIRE. OUR COMING AT IT AGAIN MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE SOME OF OUR OUR CONVERSATION AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT AGAIN. BOB WHAT TO REITERATE THAT WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THE CURRENT SURPLUS AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HELP. AT LEAST IN THE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD OF REDUCE THAT BURDEN THAT THAT WOULD BE IN PARTICULAR ON THE SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT IS. CLEARLY THE BASE AND I DISTRICTS SO YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AGAIN FOR ALL YOU. KNOW PUBLIC. DISCUSSION I'M CENTER YES THE QUESTION OF- YOU I SAW IN SPEED. COMES UP AGAIN AND- AND THERE'S SORT OF TWO TO THREE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS- I. OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS PUTTING IN HIS BUDGET IS PROPOSING THREE POINT ONE BILLION TO PAY DOWN THE FEDERAL DEBT THAT WE HAVE. FOR YOU I TRUST FUND AND I OF COURSE FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE RIGHT STEP- IN SHOWING. THE SUPPORT TO OUR BUSINESSES IN STARTING TO PAY THAT DOWN. OUT WHAT THAT WILL DO IS IT'LL SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THE STATE OWES THIS DEBT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR CONVERSATION WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATED IT WAS SORT OF THE LONGER THE LONGER TERM VISION. AND SORT OF FACING THE REALITY THAT. WHEN THERE ARE ECONOMIC OF CRISES YOU KNOW SUCH AS THE GREAT RECESSION AND WORE THE PANDEMIC WHICH WAS TREMENDOUS IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT. WE ALWAYS END UP IN THE CYCLE OF INSOLVENCY WITH OUR FUND AND HAVING TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT MY AGENCY CAN BE HELPFUL TO YOU AND OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE OR OTHER SENATORS OR SIMPLY MEMBERS IN ANALYZING WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE- WHEN LOOKING AT YOU KNOW OUR TRUST FUND. WE ARE HERE OUR DOORS ARE OPEN AND WE ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ON WHAT THOSE OPTIONS COULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT MODELS OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED. SO THAT THEY ARE NOT CONTINUOUSLY IN THE CYCLES EVERY TIME THERE IS A RECESSION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSES TO MY QUESTIONS ON. YOU HAVE A BIG JOB AHEAD OF YOU IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR ARE YOUR WEALTH- AWARE OF THAT AND CERTAINLY HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SKILL SET TO BRING TO THE JOBS WHO WISH YOU WELL AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT. WELL NOW WITH THE VOTE IS TAKEN OUT THANK YOU AGAIN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR SENATOR COBBLER. THANK YOU WANNA THANK YOU FOR SPENDING SOME TIME WITH ME YESTERDAY- THAT WAS INFORMATIVE AND YOU WHO HAVE A BIG TASK AHEAD OF YOU- WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS BUT I WANT TO JUST- ASK IT AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A- A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT ON THE RECORD- BUT I AM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND KNOW THAT- THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIANS- WHO ARE IN THE LABOR. WORKFORCE IN WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO IT AND STAY INTO IT AND HAVE IT BE SAFE AND PROTECTIVE. I'D LIKE YOU TO SHARE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW COMMUNITIES WITH- HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. AND I THINK I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT MY DISTRICT WAS- THE DISTRICT WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF OPEN CLAIMS DURING THE PANDEMIC SO HOW ARE COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH. NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYMENT- AND JOB TRAINING VOIDS BEING SERVED. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THERE MIGHT BE. HOLES IN THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO THEM AND SO YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC PART OF THAT IS AS AS I SHARED WITH YOU YOU KNOW I HAVE A BUILDING IN MY DISTRICT IN EDV BUILDING THAT'S BEEN CLOSED FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THAT FACILITY HAVE BEEN COLOCATED INTO OTHER- CITIES AND AREAS OUTSIDE OF. LA AND IT CAUSED A MAJOR DISRUPTION- FOR FOLKS WHO ARE. WHO WANT TO SEE THE STATE IN THEIR DISTRICT IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD- AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO GRANTED MANY PLACES WERE CLOSED DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THAT SO JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW IN SPACES- LIKE SOUTH LA WHERE THERE IS A VOID OF RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. HOW ARE YOU STILL WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSTITUENTS FEEL- THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE ESPECIALLY WITH ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY CRITICAL LIKE YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS BEINGABLE TO GET YOUR BENEFITS BEING ABLE TO GET HELP. WITH JOB TRAINING SKILLS LIKE CETERA. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION AND ALSO FOR THE TIME THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SPEND YESTERDAY SO I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTION AND INTO PARTS BECAUSE- THERE THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO IT. SO ON THE CRENSHAW BUILDING. AS YOU KNOW WHEN I WILL SPEAK THIS FOR THE RECORD- EDT HAS BEEN IN AND FIGHT A LEGAL BATTLE OVER THIS PROPERTY FOR MANY YEARS- THIS PROPERTY WAS A LEASE TO OWN. AND WHEN IT WAS TIME TO ACTUALLY OWN THE BUILDING OWNER AND HIS FAMILY FOX ABOUT OWNERSHIP PIECE OF THE CONTRACT AND SO THIS HAS BEEN- IN THE COURTS FOR A WHILE THE COURTS DECIDED. THAT THE OWNERS NEEDED TO HAND OVER THE DEED AND THAT THE YOU KNOW THE TITLE OF THIS BUILDING TO EDT. AND THEY HAVE ALSO DENIED- AN APPEAL OF THAT. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THE NOTGREAT NEWS IS THAT WE STILL KNOCK WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED- THE HANDOVER OF THE DEED AND TITLE FOR THAT PROPERTY AND THAT'S THE FINAL PIECE SO ONCE THAT IS DONE. I LOOK FORWARD YOU KNOW TO WORKING WITH YOU AND WE- WILL ASSESS THE CONDITION OF THAT BUILDING. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE FIXES TO IT- MY UNDERSTAND IS NOT IN GREAT SHAPE RIGHT NOW- AND THEN OF COURSE WE WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON. PLANNING AND FOX ABOUT RE OCCUPYING THAT BUILDING AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND HOW. THAT WOULD BEST SERVE THAT COMMUITY. ON THE BROADER. ABOUT AREA WITH HIGH AND A LACK OF SERVICES. THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE SITUATION TO HAVE AN AREA THAT IS ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED JOBS AND WERE SERVICES ARE LACKING SO THAT CONFLUENCE OF FACTORS IS. VERY UPSETTING TO ME AS LABOR SECRETARY AND SO ONE OF MY PRIORITIES IS TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL OF MY TEAMS HERE THAT WORK ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THAT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD EMPLOYMENT TRAINING POINT PANEL THE WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH. THEY ARE ALREADY THE COME TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE STRATEGY AND MY COMMITMENT MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING. VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND TO INVEST TRAINING DOLLARS AND PROGRAMS WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED MOST AND ALSO IN A WAY THAT INTEGRATES WITH OUR GOALS FOR DEVELOPING ENOUGH. YOU KNOW OUR HEALTH CARE ECONOMY OUR CLIMATE SUSTAINABILITY ECONOMY AND ALL OF THESE NEW- AN UPCOMING INDUSTRIES THAT WE HOPE TO BRING INTO THE STATE. AND SO THAT IS MY GOAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING MORE WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- THIS IS WHAT MAKES US RELEVANT OR IRRELEVANT HOW WELL WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS THOSE IN YOUR DISTRICT. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE YES THAT BUILDING IS JANKY. BUT YEAH I'VE HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT THE STATE HAS THE MONEY SO I'M GOING TO CROSS MY FINGERS THAT THAT GREAT PUT ON SOMEBODY'S WISH LIST. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS. HOW DO WE CREATE EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY. BETWEEN THE SERVICES IN THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT THAT WE OFFER AS A STATE. AND A CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED IT SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU- SENATOR COME LONGER AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ANSWERS THUS FAR I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE MANY QUESTIONS BUT- I DID WANT TO ASK- ABOUT. YOUKNOW AS WE GO FORWARD WE HAD A RECESSION WHEN I WE WERE COMING OUT OF A RECESSION WHEN I GOT ELECTED. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TEN AND WE HAD TO PULL TOGETHER ADDITIONAL STAFF TO HANDLE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS BEFORE WE HAD TO CREATE A STRIKE TEAMIS YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TODAY. TO KIND OF DO THAT BUT OF COURSE TODAY WE HAVE WORKFORCE ISSUES- JUST ACROSS THE BOARD AS I'M SURE YOU'RE MORE THAN AWARE OF. SO SB THREE NINETY I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU WERE SENATOR EARLIER BUT- REQUIRES EDT TO DEVELOP A RECESSION PLAN TO PREPARE FOR AN INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMPENSATION BENEFITS CLAIMS WHEN THERE'S AN ECONOMIC RECESSION. NOW LAST TIME WAS NOT QUITE LIKE WE ARE EXPERIENCING THIS TIME SO YOU MIGHT THINK GOING FORWARD WILL OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE RECESSION AND HAVE A BETTER PLAN BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO OVERWHELMED AT THIS TIME. HOW COULD WE NOT HAVE A YOU KNOW KIND OF COVERED THE BASE FOR A FUTURE RECESSION THAT PROBABLY WOULD IN NO WAY MATCH THIS ONE BUT I JUST KINDA WANT TO SENSE OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE STILL. ALL THIS HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT TOM AND GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW YOU'RE PROCEEDING FORWARD TO KIND OF PUT THAT IN PLACE SO WE DON'T HAVE A NEXT TIME TO THIS. DEGREE I'M CENTER YOU THANK FOR YOUR CALL. YOU KNOW FOR ME ONE OF THE DANGERS- THAT WE HAVE IN GOVERNMENT MANY TIMES IS SORT OF AND LEISURE OF WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. AND SO WHEN WE BOUNCE BACK. AND THINGS NORMALISE AND WE'RE IN WHAT WE CALL SORT OF THE STEADY STATE OPERATIONS WE OFTEN BEGIN TO EITHER BECAUSE THERE IS A NEED TO CUT BACK. ON FUNDING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE RE PRIORITIZATION. WE START CUTTING BACK ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS THAT WERE CAUSED BY A RECESSION. SO THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE DANGERS THAT WE NEED TO AVOID AS WE ARE COMING OUT. OF THIS RECESSION AND WORKING THROUGH THIS CONTINUE. WORKLOAD THAT WE HAVE AN EDT. THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS ALL OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED THEY DO HAVE TO BE CAPTURED IN A RECESSION PLANET SO I THINK SENATOR LAYERED. YOU THE SENATE BILL AND FOR THIS REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A RECESSION PLAN FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW AND WERE EXPECTED THAT IT WILL BE- IN YOUR HANDS TIMELY OF BY MARCH FIRST AS REQUIRED BY THE BILL- MANY OF THE LESSONS LEARNED. OUR OUR OUR PIECES THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH BASED ON THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE GOVERNOR STRIKE- STRENGTH TEAM. AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY SO THAT IT IS MORE NIMBLE SO THAT I CAN ADAPT TO CHANGING NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS. THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY STAFF ALL AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE PLANS ARE AROUND THAT SO THOSE TWO PIECES- TO GATHER ARE THE KEY BETTER ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND MODERNIZATION OVERALL ALONG WITH A STAFFING PLAN THAT WILL HELP US STOP OFF WHEN THESE CRISES HIT AGAIN WHICH OF COURSE THEY WILL. WE WANT TO LEAVE EDT AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM MUCH BETTER OFF THAN IT WAS UP DURING THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK THAT'S OUR INCREDIBLE HOPE I YES HOPEFULLY BECAUSE OF THE BILL. A REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO- YOU SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AN IN DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT MEANS I APPRECIATED- AND YOU ANSWER TO OTHER QUESTIONS IN THAT SO OFTEN I'LL SKIP THOSE QUESTIONS- BUT I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT. WHAT ONE OTHER PIECE OF THAT MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION P. WAY RECIPIENTS I'M TOLD. RECEIVED A REMINDER NOTICES FROM ED'S TO SUBMIT THEIR PROOF OF SELF EMPLOYMENT AS REQUIRED BY THE. PROVIDE REGARDING FOR ANY OTHER GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AROUND THIS OVER OVER PAYMENTS HOW ARE WE GOING TO. ADDRESS THAT YES SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. ON ALL OF THE PANDEMIC OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SUPPORT THAT WAS PROVIDED. AND SO OUR REACHING OUT TO CLAIMANTS TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYED AND SEEKING WORK WAS FOLLOWING FROM DOL'S GUIDANCE. ON THE OVERPAYMENT ISSUE WHICH WHICH IS SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT WE HAVE NOT YET BE GONE ANY OF OUR WORK OVERPAYMENTS OF COLLECTION PROCESS WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING IS WORKING WITH DEAL WELL. ON OPTIONS FOR WEAVERS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO. WE'RE NOT FRAUDULENT AND WHO WERE NOT AT FAULT AND MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE- AND SO FAR DEAL HAS RESPONDED AND THE PROVIDED AT SEVEN OPTIONS FOR WEAVERS- AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE HOW WE WOULD IMPLEMENT THOSE AND WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE MIGHT BE TO WAVE. OVER PAYMENTS THAT ARE DUE TO NON FRAUD AND NON FAULT AS WELL. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE DOING THIS RIGHT AND THAT- WE ARE. YOU KNOW. ARENA OF ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT WERE IN PLACE WHEN HE WAY WENT OUT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I AM PRETTY SURE THAT AS AS WE LOOK AT THAT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION A REMINDER NOTICES THAT MANY OF OUR STAFFS ARE GOING TO. BE PART OF THAT PROCESS AND I DO WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE EVEN IS OVERWHELMED AND DIFFICULT AS IT HAS BEEN. THE STAFF AND ET DE HAVE RESPONDED TO OUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- IT HASN'T BEEN EASY BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT- I IT YOU KNOW ONE THING I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE. IS THE WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION PRIORITY INITIATIVE AND I WONDERED IF YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME JUST OF A SHORT GLIMPSE OF HOW THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING IN AN UPDATE ON EFFORTS AS IT RELATES TO THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. INTO NEW SECTORS. YES I THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THIS IS ONE THAT I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND VERY INVOLVED IN. A WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH VR A WITH THE DIRECTOR THERE AS WELL AS OUR DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING OUT. WHAT THAT FUNDING- COULD GO FORWARD AND WE HAVE SEVERAL IDEAS AROUND- INNOVATIVE PRACTICES IN THE TRADES THAT BRING MORE WOMEN IN- WE ARE CONSIDERING SUPPORT SERVICES THAT WOMEN NEED. TO FINISH THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- AND EVEN ACCESS THOSE PROGRAMS. AND WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH LOOKING I- BROUGHT ANY NOT. TRAINING SO TRAINING FOR WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION AROUND SAFETY AND HEALTH- AND OTHER ISSUES AROUND MENTOR SHIP AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A VOICE IN A WORKPLACE THAT TRADITIONALLY. DOESN'T INCLUDE A LOT OF WOMEN WHICH CAN BE VERY INTIMIDATING FONG. I WILL SAY IN YOU KNOW IN THE FALL I WAS ABLE TO VISIT WITH MANY OF OUR PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY ARE JUST AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES UP FOR PEOPLE YOU KNOW OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CAREERS. WITH VAULT IN A WORKPLACE. BUT WHAT IS LACKING IS CLEARLY WOMEN AND SO I. ALWAYS MENTION THIS- TO THROUGH THE TRADES AND THEY ARE TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEY ARE ALSO. ARE CONSIDERING WAYS THAT THEY CAN BE MORE INNOVATIVE PARTICULARLY IN THE RECRUITMENT. OF WOMEN AND THE SUPPORT OF THOSE AND THAT WOMEN ONCE THEY ENTER THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AND COMPLETE THOSE PROGRAMS. WE I'M THREE TO HEAR YOUR HAVE ABOUT THIS I KNOW NUMBER MY COLLEAGUES ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE UPDATES ON IT. MOVING FORWARD AND AS WE LOOK AT MARCH WHICH IS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE DEFINITELY- IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF EXPANDING THE WORK FORCE- I. YOU KNOW I THINK. ALL OF THE QUESTIONS ARE I COULD PROBABLY ASK MORE BUT BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED AND- YOU SEEM TO REALLY HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE PULSE I AGREE WITH THE VICE CHAIR. ON WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST AND THEN THE MONUMENTAL TASK ON THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU OVERSEE BUT YOU KNOW LEAST- LEASE THE YOU THINK WE DON'T READ YOUR MATERIALS AND YOUR BIO I DID HAVE ONE INTERESTING QUESTION I JUST HAD TO ASK. I IN READING THE BIO. BUT YOU SAY THAT WHILE SMALL URUGUAY WAS THE FIRST EVER WORLD SOCCER WINNER IN NINETEEN THIRTY AYE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU FOLLOW SOCCER I LOVE IT. I FIND IT INTERESTING AND MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US R. AS TO WHY THIS IS THAT WHILE URUGUAY IS SUCH A STOP SMALL TINY COUNTRY OF LIKE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. THAT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY SEEMS TO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE NUMBER. HI URUGUAY AMERICAN STAFF TO EITHER WORK OR HAVE WORKED THERE. I MEAN I'M A FAMILIAR THAT ARE PRO PREVIOUS- GOVERNOR BROWN'S UNDER SECRETARY OF THE LABOR SECRETARY YOU'VE GOT AGENTS YOU MAY REMEMBER. FORMER SECRETARY OVER THERE. A SON OF URUGUAY IMMIGRANTS AND ALSO AN AVID FOOTBALL FAN. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE HIS PARTNER IS THE PERSON WHO IS THE SECRETARY OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WHO KEEPS ME ON TASK DURING THIS HEARING. WHICH TYPICALLY SHE IS NOT DOING QUESTION BUT- I JUST WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME- ARE YOU ARE YOU IMPORTING- TALENT FROM. OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH TO MAKE CALIFORNIA BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. YEAH I MEAN I THINK I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ANSWER AND I LOVE THIS QUESTION AND YOU KNOW AND I DON'T I HIGHLIGHT YOUR BOY IN MY BIO BECAUSE- MANY PEOPLE NEVER HEAR ABOUT URUGUAY AND SO I DO LOVE YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT WHY IT'S FOR MY PARENTS ARE FROM MY- MY ENTIRE FAMILY SO. YOU KNOW. WHYIS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS IT'S VERY FULLER TO THE UNITED STATES IT IS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS AND SO YES IT WASN'T IMPORTER. OF A LOT OF EUROPEANS- THAT CAME WITH AN ADDED A PASSION FOR SOCCER AND SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO ARGENTINA THAT'S WHERE THE TRADITION AND THE PASSION COMES FROM. I WOULD ALSO- WE'RE SEEING WHICH IS A AND THAT MIGHT ANSWER WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF- YOUR WINDS ARE YOU KNOW CHILDREN OF YOUR LINES HERE- URUGUAY IS A VERY. PROGRESSIVE COUNTRY AND IT'S VERY CONNECTED UP TO THE WORLD IN TERMS OF ARTS AND ECONOMY AND- IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND SO WHILE IT HAS THREE AND A HALF OR SO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY I BELIEVE THERE ARE ABOUT ANOTHER MILLION AND A HALF OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY. ARE DOING GREAT THINGS. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWER- IS A LITTLE BIT. I IT'S GREAT TO ALWAYS MORE I YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE CAN BE AND THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD YEAH WE TEND TO BE RECEIVED BY OTHER COUNTRIES AS IF WE WERE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT OR CONGRESS WHICH IS A LITTLE ODD- TO SAY THE LEAST BUT- I'VE BEEN TREATING SENATOR LAYERED I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE- QUESTION OR PROBLEM. WELL THERE ARE WAS. ADMONISHED BY THE SECRETARY IN OUR MEETING FOR DESCRIBING HOW I HAD BEEN IN BUENOS IRIS ONCE AND WALKED BY. THE FERRY TO MONTEVIDEO AND DIDN'T GET ON IT. SO SHE WAS- LET ME KNOW THAT I'D REALLY MADE THE WRONG DECISION- RUNNING OUT ON THE RECORD AND LET ME AS LONG AS I'M- TALKING. IT THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM FOR THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T BRING UP MY BILL YOU DID IT AND THAT IS THAT IS WONDERFUL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE SECRETARY. KNOWS THAT THE BILL SPECIFIED TO REPORT FOR MARCH FIRST AND WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO IT SO. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY CENTER WE HAVE MANY WAYS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT WHAT- WHAT WHAT YOU'RE AWARE OF AND SO- I. AM THRILLED THAT SENATOR GROW WAS ABLE TO REJOIN IS WHAT I'M BUYING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO SHE CAN GET GROUNDED TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT SHE'S DOING DOUBLE DUTY OUT WE'VE JUST FINISHED UP WITH A AROUND OF QUESTIONS FROM FROM EVERYONE BUT WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CENTER GROVE TO ASK A QUESTION OR MAKE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEN AND IT'S VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD- THEY'VE FOR YESTERDAY A BELIEVER SOMETHING I DON'T REMEMBER FRIDAY. MAYBE THURSDAY OR FRIDAY I APPRECIATE THAT I THOUGHT AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY ENGAGING AND I REALLY APPRECIATED. AND YOUR RESPONSES AND SO WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA I KNOW YOU CAN FROM THE EAST COAST AND WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA. AND ALL THIS ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I'M SURE THEY WERE ALREADY ASKED BY. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES I APOLOGIZE THAT I WAS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME. AND YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE U. I TRUST FUND WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CENTER YOUR PURVIEW. AND DAD IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL DOLLAR AMOUNTAND EMPLOYERS- WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE LAST YOU I TRUST FUND OVERDRAFT. AND IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS I BELIEVE SIX YEARS TO PAY IT BACK IT WAS SUBSTANTIAL- AT THE END OF EVERY YEAR YOU WOULD JUST GET A BILL IN WITHIN THREE WEEKS YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR- WHATEVER IT WAS. AND SOME BUSINESSES REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THAT. BUT YOU HAD A VERY BALANCED APPROACH TO THE U. I TRUST THAT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. TO COVER THE OVERDRAFT PAYMENT FOR THIS YEAR BUT THEY'RE STILL PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS IN FRONT OF US SO WHAT'S YOUR LONG TERM PLAN- THOUGHTS ON THE U. I TRUST FUND AND I ALSO ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION. VERY MUCH AND SO I THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE WELCOME. YES WE DID TALK A LITTLE BT ABOUT THIS BUT I WILL. REITERATE SOME OF WHAT I SAID. THE GOVERNOR'S YOU KNOW THREE POINT ONE BILLION OF TOWARD THE FEDERAL DEBT THAT IS OWED. OF FOR OUR E. U. I. TRUST FUND IS SIGNIFICANT AND- IT SHOWS THAT. YOU KNOW HE IS WITH EMPLOYERS HE UNDERSTANDS THIS BURDEN. OF THAT CONTINUES TO OCCUR EVERY TIME. THERE IS AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN- IN OUR STATE. AND THE TRUST FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT AND WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND BORROW. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED. EARLIER AND- AND I BELIEVE THIS WAS ADDRESSING SENATOR BEATS QUESTION ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC. WAS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO. APPROACH AND THINK ABOUT THE U. I TRUST FUNDS. AND THERE ARE MANY MODELS OUT THERE- FROM OTHER STATES AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. AND SO WHEREAS WE MIGHT BE BUCKET MORE. IN THE CATEGORY OF A PAY AS YOU GO STATE. WE DON'T COLLECT THAT MUCH UP FRONT. AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE HAVE RECESSIONS. WE END UP HAVING TO- TAX EMPLOYERS TO COVER THAT DEBT. THERE ARE OTHER MODELS. THERE ARE MODELS THAT THINK MORE ABOUT FORWARD FUND. A LITTLE MORE AND YOU'RE YOU'RE A HAVE A BETTER AT RISK. SO THAT YOU HAVE THERE ARE EVEN MODELS THAT GO WAY BEYOND THIS WHERE THERE CALPERS CYCLICAL AND THEY BUILD UP VERY LARGE RESERVES. AND ACTUALLY TRY TO REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS. WHEN THERE ARE RECESSIONS AND WHEN THEY MAY NEED THAT TAX RELIEF THE MOST SO ALL TO SAY THERE ARE MANY MODELS AND WE ARE HERE TO HELP. ARE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AS YOU THINK THROUGH THIS ISSUE UP WITH ANALYSIS DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER STATES- EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS OUT THERE OR EVEN ANALYSIS ON HOW CHANGES COULD IMPACT. THE STATE AND OUR EMPLOYERS. THANK YOU AM I KNOW AND THAT WAS YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T- I DON'T RECALL DISCUSSING IT ABOUT TAXING EMPLOYERS MORE AND CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST I MEAN WE'RE ACTUALLY- ALMOST 5% HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE SO TO INCREASE HER IS AGAIN. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VIABLE SOLUTION- I'D I'D LIKE AND I DON'T RECALL THAT BEING ONE OF THE RESPONSES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO BRING THAT TO MY ATTENTION TODAY. AND AT THAT CAN I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR THE THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT HE ALLOWED FOR A PAYMENT AND TO HELP WITH THE SITUATION THAT WAS CAUSED. AN OVER THE PANDEMIC PERIOD FOR THAT YOU I TRUST FUND TO BE- INSOLVENT A I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE I HAVE- ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I WANT TO TALK TO THAT WE BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT THE ELLERBEE THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD. THAT TAKES ON ISSUES- WAGING OUR ISSUES AND THINGS LIKE THAT FOR FARMWORKERS AND THEY'RE KIND OF UNDER YOUR PURVIEW BUT NOT REALLY THERE AN INDEPENDENT- BOARD BUT THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE DEEP AS SECRETARY OF LABOR TRUE OR NOT TRUE. YES SO THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BORDER AT THE A. R. B. E. IS AN INDEPENDENT BOARD THAT FALLS UNDER- THE LABOR FAMILY OF GROUPS OF PANELS BOARDS AND DEPARTMENTS WE SAY IT'S INDEPENDENT BECAUSE IT'S DECISIONS WHEN THERE ARE CASES BROUGHT TO THE BOARD ARE INDEPENDENCE OF MY INFLUENCE FOR ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S INFLUENCE SO YOU HAVE THE THESE ARE INDEPENDENT- DECISIONS THAT'S WHAT THAT'S- WHY IT IS AWARD. HOWEVER THE ROLE OF THE LRB IS SPECIFICALLY IN THE SPACE OF LABOR- RELATIONS WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL OF LANDSCAPE. SO IT IS NOT. LIKE D. DIVISIONS WHICH ARE FOLK ON SAFETY AND HEALTH. AS WELL AS WE AND OUR AND OVERTIME. AND RETALIATES. SO IT IS A VERY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON. LABOR RELATIONS- ISSUES AND PROCESSES FOR WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE SEPARATE FROM THE SECRETARY OF LABOR'S AT. OVERSIGHT NEAR DECISIONS ARE SEPARATE FROM ME YES OF COURSE THEY ARE INTEGRATED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE EVER WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SUPPORTING EMPLOYERS IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR WORKERS THEY WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT- PARTICULARLY IF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE AGRICULTURAL SPACE THEY THOUGHT THEY DON'T FOCUS ON THE SAFETY HEALTH OR WAGES AND HOURS ARE CONDITIONS OF WORK ISSUES THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OVERSEAS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT PART OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT AND I LEFT YOUR RESPONSE THAT YOU WERE SURPRISED AT THAT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS THAT TYPE OF LIFE HE DID SAY I THINK TWO OR THREE OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT IT. AND THAT AT THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THE TIMETHAT. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT- LAW IN EXISTENCE. THERE IS A BALLOT MEASURE ON THE BALLOT THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY EMPLOYER ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. OF WHICH WOULD- IN ADDITION TO REFORM IN THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACT WHICH HAS HUGE AN INTENSIVE KERR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER IT DOES DRASTICALLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY BENEFIT ALL TRIAL LAWYERS. BUT YOU KNOW YOU GO THROUGH THESE LONG PROCESSES OF A LOT OF THIS LITIGATION AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING YOU KNOW I KNOW IN CASE WE GOT LIKE THREE DOLLARS EACH IN A DOLLAR FIFTY EACH AND THE EMPLOYER PAID OUT MULTI MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- IN THE ATTORNEY KIND OF WALKED AWAY WITH A HUGE PORTION- SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS OF THESE CASES IS THE GENERAL WAY HAPPENS WHICH CAUSED. US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND IN ACTED BRING SETTLEMENTS TO THE DIR AND VENDA DIR SO THERE WERE SETTLEMENTS COULD BE REVIEWED SO THAT THE D. I. R. COULD STEP IN AND SAY NO MISTER ATTORNEY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A MILLION WELL THESE MILLION DOLLARS WHILE THESE EMPLOYEES GET. A DOLLAR FIFTY OR WHATEVER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS. SO IF OR SHOULD THIS BALLOT MEASURE PASS AND IT WOULD BRING MORE RESPONSIBILITY LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE SO IF IT DOES PASS SHOULD IT PASS HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT ON HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THE AGENCY AND SPECIFICALLY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE- BECAUSE. IF IT DOES PASS IT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE EVALUATING AND WE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY ASSESS- YOU KNOW WE ABSOLUTELY DISCUSS PAGA AND I AM VERY COGNIZANT OF SOME OF THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES AND THE UNINTENDED SORT OF CONSEQUENCES AND ACTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THIS ACT- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN PROVIDING INFORMATION TO YOU TO UNDERSTAND. HOW OUR WORK MAY LOOK DIFFERENT IF THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE PASSES WE ARE HERE TO DO THAT- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- TO INFORM YOU AS THE POLICYMAKERS ON YOU KNOW ANY ANYTHING ELSE- THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU AND WALK YOU KNOW. WITH YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTIONS IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO SPEND IT WAS A PLEASURE ALMOST AN HOUR WITH YOU I FELT BAD- SO ALMOST AN HOUR WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONFIRMATION IWISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. I THINK I AM- YOU KNOW. THE PRIOR SECRETARY OF LABOR THAT WE HAD- I KNOW SHE WENT ON TO WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS AND THE DC LEVEL OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR AT LEAST WILLINGNESS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WILLINGNESS ON THE OTHER YOU KNOW THE LABOR SECRETARY. TO EVEN EXPLORE OR LOOK AT THE ADVERSE. AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT ON BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS TO EVEN APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ON THE U. I TRUST FUND ISSUE AND HOW- YOU KNOW HOW THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. I JUST APPRECIATED ALL YOUR REMARKS AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES AND BE FAIR BALANCE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION.

THANK YOU- ADAM HAD TEN GOOD AFTERNOON PREP TIME ATKINS BASED BATES AND GROW COMMON AND THEIR WORK IT'S AN HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO BE AT THE HEARING FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. ALTHOUGH MY CAREER IN STATE SERVICE ANOTHER PUBLIC PUBLIC AGENCIES HAS PREPARED ME FOR THIS ROLE I DO NOT OVERLOOK THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BEING THE FIRST WOMAN AND FIRST LESBIAN NOT TO BE PERMANENTLY APPOINTED TO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR AND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY FOR CONFIRMATION I AM THANKFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR THIS APPOINTMENT. AND THE SUPPORTER IN MY LEADERSHIP. I TO SINCERELY YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE TIME TO CONSIDER ME FOR THIS POSITION. THE HOW I GOT TO THIS POINT IN MY CAREER IS AS IMPORTANT AS TO THE WIDE BELIEVE MY LIFE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A VALUABLE PERSPECTIVE. AS THE DAUGHTER TO IMMIGRANT PARENTS WHO CAME FROM MEXICO IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SIXTIES. I WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROVIDE FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATION UNINSURED COLLEGE ACCESS. RUN A SMALL BUSINESS AND BECOME HOMEOWNERS. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION EDUCATION FOR PAYING JOBS AND HEALTHCARE AND THE ABILITY TO BUDGET FOR OUR HOUSEHOLD LET ALONE A SMALL BUSINESS. OR CORNERSTONE CONVERSATIONS AT THE DINNER TABLE THROUGHOUT MY UPBRINGING. AS AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS- MY PARENTS ONLY SPEAK SPANISH OFTEN OFTEN LOOK TO US THEIR CHILDREN TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. THAT OUR FAMILY RELIED ON. WHETHER MY PARENTS WERE APPLYING FOR A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN OR NAVIGATING THE EDUCATION SYSTEMS FOR THEIR KIDS. WE WERE ALWAYS THERE TO HELP. ASSEMBLY ADVOCATE AND REPRESENT AXIS AND FAMILIARITY PUBLIC SERVICES WERE NOT AS EASY OR EVEN READILY AVAILABLE. WHEN USING THEIR HARD WORK ETHIC AS THEY MANAGED A SMALL BUSINESS PROPELLED ME TO WANT TO PURSUE A CAREER THAT WOULD HELP ME ADDRESS. THE INEQUITIES THAT I EXPERIENCE GROWING UP IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND HUNTINGTON PARK. THE LIMITED ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE FEW HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS HEALTH CARE OR OTHER SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTS INSPIRED ME TO PURSUE STUDIES. THAT WOULD GIVE ME THE SKILL SETS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE URBAN POVERTY INEQUITIES. AND WHILE STUDYING EVERY PLANNING I FOUND MY CALLING AND WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT TO CREATE MORE EQUITABLE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND USER FRIENDLY SYSTEMS THAT ALL CITIZENS. COULD ACCESS. SERENDIPITOUSLY THROUGHOUT MY CAREER I'VE BEEN APPLYING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. AT MANY INTERSECTING POINTS AND BECAUSE OF MY LIFE AND CAREER EXPERIENCES MY PERSPECTIVE OF HOW I AM LEADING TGS. IS TO PROMOTE THE HUMAN CENTERED LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION SO THAT WE ARE PROVIDE WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING ACCESS AND DELIVERING EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE RESULTS. I'M ALSO INTENT ON LEAN IN ORGANIZATION THAT PRIORITIZES DELIVERING RESULTS IN A TIMELY COST EFFECTIVE MODELS FOR CUSTOMERS. PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY PARENTS GUSTAVO AND YOU LEARN THE LAST SO FOR ALL THEIR SACRIFICES STRONG WORTH WORK ETHIC- CONDITIONAL LOVE FAITH COMMITMENT TO GIVING MY BROTHER SISTERS AND MYSELF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO STELLAR EDUCATION. I WANT TO THANK MY SIBLINGS GUSTS MARTY LILY ARE PAVING THE PATH TO HELPING ME REACH HIGHER EDUCATION. MY DEEPEST APPRECIATION TO MY LEVEL HAS BEEN A WHOLE SESSION ON THIS WHO FIRMLY SUPPORTS ME ENCOURAGES MY DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND TO OUR TWO CHILDREN OUT ABOUT AGE TEN AND THE L. H. EIGHT FOR BEING INCREDIBLY UNDERSTANDING AND AWESOME CHEERLEADERS OF MY WORK AT EACH YES FINALLY. I WANT TO THANK MY VILLAGE OF CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO ARE HELPING US FOR OUR KIDS AS JOSE AND I PURSUE OUR DEDICATION TO BEING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THOSE OPEN COM IN A WE TO WHO WERE IN SCHOOL WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN THEIR SMILE FACES AND CONGRATULATIONS THAT YOU HAVE A VILLAGE HELPING TO SUPPORT YOU. IN THAT ENDEAVOR- LET ME- CENTER GLARED WOULD YOU LIKE TO KICK US OFF AGAIN THIS TIME. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- N. R. I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT THE- I WORKED WITH THE NOMINATION. NOMINALLY WORK FOR THE RESOURCES AGENCY IS THE DIRECTOR OF EXPOSITION PARK IN LOS ANGELES AND WE WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER AND- AND WHILE THE FACT THAT WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET YESTERDAY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE FIRST ONE. I SORT OF WAS- DESCRIBE MY OWN KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OVER TEN YEARS AND IT WAS AS MY LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WILL UNDERSTAND I HAD THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WHERE THEY MADE ME TAKE THIS AMENDMENT TO THE BILL AND THEN THEY VETO THE BILL FOR THE AMENDMENT THAT MAKE ME TAKE THEM. IT WAS A VERY DISORGANIZED DEPARTMENT AND THEN I THINK THAT IN THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS IT HAS BECOME COLLABORATIVE IT ACTUALLY IS HIS OUTCOME ORIENTED BAND IT HAS BEEN A MAJOR CHANGE AND MY QUESTION WAS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE THIS AFFECT OF MAKING SURE THAT. THAT IT'S NOT CONTROL DEPARTMENT IT JUST ALWAYS MINDLESSLY STOPS THINGS BUT THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WORKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT STATURE COLLABORATE AND GET THINGS DONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER FOR- THAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YESTERDAY WHEN WILL MATCH. OPERATIONALLY DG IS VERY BROAD HAS MORE THAN TWENTY OFFICES AND DIVISIONS HAS A VERY DIVERSE PORTFOLIO. AND OF SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENTS OR DIVISIONS WITHIN THE JETS COULD BE THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS ON THEIR OWN- BUT WHEN I GOT TO D. G. S. AND I SAW ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING IN THE TELEWORK SITUATION RIGHT. AND WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS HYBRID THAT THEY CAN. QUICKLY BECOME VERY SILENT. AND AS A CONTROL AGENCY. ARE SOME OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SAID THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO CROSS OLLABORATION CROSS POLLINATE SOME OTHER TEAMS THAT- SILO TYPE ENVIRONMENT CAN HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY. SO I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SUSTAINABILITY. THURMOND AND OUR REALIST- PORTFOLIO ASK THREE FOCUS AREAS- I THINK IT'S TIME THAT THE REALLY FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY AND WORKING ACROSS OUR TWENTY DIVISIONS ON THIS TOPIC AND SEEING HOW WE CAN CROSS POLLINATE TEAMS WORK TOGETHER I HOPE TO- CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD A ONE DGS MINDSET THAT IS COLLABORATIVE THAT IS CUSTOMER FOCUSED AND IS- INTENT ON DELIVERING SERVICES IN A TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE WAY. OF BUT ALSO THAT WITHIN THE TEAMS THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS THAT THEY REACH ACROSS THE VIRTUAL AISLE OR VIRTUAL AFFORDABLE TO ENSURE- THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUT OUR CUSTOMERS FIRST. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT RISK AND JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE. ARE ANXIOUS THAT THAT HAPPENED- DURING YOUR TENURE IN THAT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE TO BE RESPONSIVE. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT. IT IS YOU DESCRIBED THAT WHEN YOU HAD WORKED. AT SOME POINT FOR THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT YOU HAD TO TAKE PLANS IN A TO HAVE REVIEWED IN SOME FORM BY THE VERY AGENCY THAT YOU'RE NOW HEADING. AND I ASKED YOU IF YOU WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTER. BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE IN THIS POSITION AND YOU ANSWERED IT WELL I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER TO THE HEARING. ABSOLUTELY AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT FOLLOWING MY CONFIRMATION HEARING- WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM I TO CLEAR HIS. FOR THE DIVISION OF STATE ARCHITECT THAT SAME DIVISION THAT- MANY TIMES MY COLLEAGUES MY FORMER COLLEAGUES AT LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I WALKED OVER PLANS FOR REVIEW. THE DIVISION OF STATE ARCHITECTS- HAS REALLY-TRANSFORMED THEIR SERVICES SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY'VE GONE TO FILING ELECTRONICALLY AND WHAT USED TO TAKE OR WHAT WAS VERY ONEROUS PROCESS FOR THE CLIENT BEFORE- AND PROBABLY LINKED. AND THEN ANTICIPATED A LOT OF FOLKS HAD TO FILL THAT INTO THEIR SCHEDULES HE DAY THEY CAN GO TO AN ONLINE PORTAL. AND THE DIVISION OF THE ARCHITECTS PROVIDES A GREAT CUSTOMER HERE REFUSE TO THEIR CLIENTS TO ENSURE THAT PLANTS ONCE DELIVERED AND PUT IN THE QUEUE ARE IN THE PROPER FORMAT FOR REVIEW AND CAN. I HAVE A QUICK TURNAROUND SAID THE PROJECT CAN MOVE FORWARD TO BED AN OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY CONSTRUCTION. AND SO IT'S FOR TO IT IS THAT DIVISION IS THE ARCHITECTS MOVED INTO AN ONLINE PORTAL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TWO YEARS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO THEY WERE PRIMED AND READY LOSER. JUST YOU'RE LUCKY THAT THEY HAD ALREADY DONE THIS AND THAT THERE ARE TEAMS HAD ALREADY LEARNED OF THE PROCESS AND FOLKS OF WHO ARE THEIR CUSTOMERS HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THIS. ONLINE DELIVERY METHOD SO- YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM MY STAFF I DECLARE WHO ARE PRESENT LATER BUT- I THINK- THAT CREDIT IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO REVIEW PLANS IS NO LONGER THERE. AT LEAST I HEAR FROM FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY. THANK YOU AND I JUST APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THAT EXPERIENCE INTO YOUR JOB I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU WHEN WE GET. THE CHANCE THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. THANK YOU. I THINK POLITICAL. YOU HAVE TO AT THEM OKAY MEDEVACED I WILL GO TO YOU NEXT. MISTER. WELL DIRECTOR DIRECTOR OF LAWFUL IS LAWFUL ON CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION OF FOR BEING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES FOR A LOOK AT YOUR RESUME VERY IMPRESSIVE IN IN BECAUSE I PARTICULARLY NOTICED THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH THE DESIGN BUILD I THINK OF THE- DEREGULATE RIGHT TO DESIGN BUILD INSTITUTE AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP- ONE OF MY FIRST ASSIGNMENTS WAS PLAYING IN A ON THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO GET THE- THE ASPHALT ON THE ROADS THE ROADS DONE MORE UP MORE QUICKLY AND THE DESIGN BUILD CONCEPT CAME AND- IT WAS LIKE A- YOU KNOW LUNOKHOD TWO MOVING PROJECTS MORE QUICKLY. SO THAT EXPERIENCE. A VERY IMPRESSIVE TO ME REALLY. IMPORTANT TO THERE AND ALL IN THE- WORLD. THANK YOU FOR THAT- COUPLE QUESTION I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET PERSONALLY AND I DO APOLOGIZE BUT YESTERDAY. WAS ON IT JUST OF KIND OF A CRAZY DAY ON MY SCHEDULE BUT- HEARING YOUR PRESENTATION- TO MY COLLEAGUE. AND DONNA- YOUR EXPLANATION OF HIS SOME VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THERE ARE YOU TO HAVE A COUPLE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COVERED YET AND- ONE CAUGHT MY EYE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE HAVE THE HOMELESS ISSUE. AS YOU KNOW AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE NOT HAD SIGNIFICANT INTEREST FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO USE THE SURPLUS PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN DECLARED I THINK I'M LOOKING AT MY NUMBERS HERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR PROPERTIES- DIFFER. THAT WERE REALLY REALLY BE SO HELPFUL WITH THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT AND WHAT MIGHT BE DONE WHAT WHAT COULD BE THE PROCESS TO. INCENTIVIZE ENCOURAGE THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- AND WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO COLLABORATE. OF FOR REGIONFOR SAY LET FAIL SMALLER LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW MOVE FORWARD ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE TOO LARGE BUT CERTAINLY IF THEY CAN COLLABORATE REGIONALLY THAT COULD BE HELPFUL. WHO ARE YOU BUILDING ANY INCENTIVES INTO. THE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE THERE ALSO THAT THEY WOULD TAKE A SECOND LOOK. AT THE NOTES WE GO FORWARD AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE- MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCKS TO. OUR HOME THE PHONE. SOLUTION THANK YOU VERY MOISTURE RATES FROM CLASH. AND THIS IS- SOME THAT PREDATES MY TIME AT TGS HOW I CAN SPEAK TO THE X. ORDER. TO THREE TO AND- THE OFFERING OF THIS HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR PARCELS THAT WERE DECLARED SURPLUS- IT IS TRUE THAT NOT SO LONG SO FAR HAVE BEEN TAKEN UP BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMMUNITIES COUNTIES OR CITIES. TO PLACE SHELTERS SO WE HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS I HAVE HAD QUITE SUCCESS- BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN AND THIS IS JUST MY- WHAT I'VE LEARNED AND GLEANED FROM SPEAKING TO STAFF IS THAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY BE LOOKING ATPROPERTIES THAT THE STATE OFFERED AND THOSE MAY NOT BE IN THE LOCATIONS ARE VIABLE OR CLOSE TO OR IN. A IN A- APPROXIMATE LOCATION TO WHERE THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES AND SO THEY MAY GO WITH PROPERTIES THAT THEY THEMSELVES- I AM INTENT THOUGH I'M TAKING THE DGS- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. USING A HUMAN CENTERED LEADERSHIP APPROACH BUT ALSO HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN AND THAT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS PROVIDING MORE USER FRIENDLY INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC. SO ENSURING THAT CERTAIN PORTALS OF OUR WEBSITE AND INFORMATION THAT WE ARE SHARING- CAN BE MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE I THINK YOU KNOW I YOU BRING UP A REALLY GREAT IDEA AND- I CAN TAKE THIS BACK TO MY TEAM TO SEE IF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. AN INTERSECTION WHERE WE CAN PROMOTE SOME OF THAT SURPLUS- LIST OF PROPERTIES AND SEE HOW WE CAN WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND JURISDICTIONS- ON A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY OF THE PROPERTIES. WE ARE OFFERING AT A NOMINAL FEE. THE GREAT PAPER THE CHILL TAKE OUT FOR. I WAS THINKING THEIR SON OFF. FOR REGIONS AND WE CAN CALL FOR THE CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE WHERE THERE'S SOMETHING IN A LARGE PARCELS AND- OF. THE INDIVIDUALS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTICIPATE WITH WHATEVER IS REQUIRED IN TERMS OF LESS SAFE YOU KNOW A STARTUP MONEY OR FUNDING IN SOME SORT TALK. THAT WILL I THINK BE VERY IMPORTANT INCENTIVE TO THEM AND ALSO GET PEOPLE WORKING ON. THE PROBLEM AS A REGIONAL ISSUE VERSUS CITY BY CITY WHICH IS KIND OF THE WAY I. LIVE IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR AND CREATED UP A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT FOR BIT OF DISSENSION- CERTAINLY- I IDEAS OF MAYBE WE COULD A LIST OF THOSE PROPERTIES OF- THEY MAY HAVE BEEN PUBLICIZED AND SEEN THEM PERSONALLY BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK. CERTAINLY FOR MY REGION AND UP. THAT WAY I CAN. ENCOURAGE MY LOCAL FIRE EVEN BEYOND OUT TO A TAKE A LOOK OUT TO OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE THERE AND REACHING OUT TO. SOME OF THEIR OTHER COLLEAGUES- IN IN THE REGION. A QUICK QUESTION ON THE NO BID CONTRACTS I KNOW THAT THAT IS BEING. CERTAINLY COVERED. IN THE MEDIA- EXTENSIVELY AND I AM I THINK OUR CONCERN IS IF THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE STATE FROM POOR PERFORMANCE BY A COMPANY THAT'S UNDER. A NO BID CONTRACT ANY ESPECIALLY IF DOUBTS ONE THAT GETS RENEWED WITHOUT ANY REAL OR- YEAH. OVER ON OUR ANY PER. METRICS WERE PROVIDED TO ALL WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN THE CONTRACT AND WHETHER THEY NOT FOUND. WHETHER THEY HAVE AVOIDED DOLLARS SOME OF THE SCANDALOUS PHOTO. REPORTS OF COMMON A FEW OF THEM I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME REAL CONCERN IN AN EMERGING OF. CREDIBILITY ISSUE- CERTAINLY IN THE DURING THE PANDEMIC I'M GOING FORWARD. SO IF YOU ALL COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT YOU WILL. BE DOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. LET'S SAY A MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE. PROCESS IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ON NO BID APPROACHES SOMETIMES. HAVING SERVED A LITTLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES THE THAT ACTUALLY GETS THE JOB DONE MORE QUICKLY AND SOMETIMES THOSE CERTAINLY UNDER BUDGET. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW ON THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE THERE AND CERTAINLY- THE PERFORMANCE METRICS. THAT WERE MET BEFORE IT'S RENEWED. CERTAINLY I THINK A VERY QUESTION I THINK YOU FOR. ASKING THAT AND- THE WHEN WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY DESK. AND THERE'S AN EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT FEET DEPARTMENT CHARLES. PROCUREMENT DIVISION- WELL SUPPORT OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD THE EMERGENCY CONTRACT BUT WE HAVE PER FOR ALL PARTICIPATION IN SOME OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SO I THINK THAT REFERS TO SOME OF THESE AUTOMATIC- RENEWALS THAT. OUR PROCUREMENT DIVISION IN RUNNING A REGULAR PROCUREMENT FROM SOUP TO NUTS- WOULD NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED WHEN WE DO PROCUREMENT IN A REGULAR. PROCUREMENT TIMELINE WE ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES OR GOODS ARE DELIVERED PRIOR TO PAYMENT WE ENSURE THAT- THE BAND AND THE CONTEST IS TRANSPARENT AND- OUR BUYERS STATE BUYERS REVIEW- THE VENDORS BACKGROUND ENSURE THAT THEIR SOLVENT. ALSO WE HAVE CONTROL MEASURES IN PLACE AND AS A CONTROL AGENCY DGS TAKES ABOUT DELEGATION VERY SERIOUSLY- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE X. OR C. UNDER THE VARIOUS EMERGENCIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH A INCLUDING. THE UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC- THAT CREATED SUCH HIGH NEEDS BUT I DO WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT OUR PROCUREMENT DIVISION IS INTENT ON CONTINUOUSLY FOLLOWING THE MEASURES AMHERST POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY- WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING SOME OF THOSE IF YOU COULD- YOU KNOW FOLLOW UP TIED TO MY OFFICE PROVIDE ME WITH HOW THOSE REVIEWS ARE DONE- I THINK THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY REALLY ARE. LOOKING IN DOUBT THAT SUMMER CRITTERS THAT HAVE COME IN A COUPLE OF BILLS THAT HAVE REALLY. HIT THE MEDIA YEAH AND- WE GET QUESTIONS FROM HER CONSTITUENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON THE PHONE CERTAINLY ARE NOT RIDDLED WITH CONTROVERSY AND POTENTIAL FRAUD. SO IF YOU WOULD GET THOSE TO ME THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BUT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES AND CERTAINLY ARE. YOU HAVE A BIG JOB IN FRONT OF YOU SO- WILL HOPE TO HEAR BACK ON HOW THINGS ARE GOING ON IN THE NEAR TERM. IT'S THANK YOU MADAM VICE SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU IT'S DEFINITELY A PLEASURE- TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU CONGRATULATIONS SIGNED- BEING THE FIRST THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFITS TO THAT- I'M THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN THAT'S EVER SERVED IN THE STATE CAPITAL AND YOU BEING THE FIRST FEMALE AND LATINA TO EVER HOLD THIS POSITION IS TRULY SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CHERISH FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO. CONGRATULATIONS ON AND THAT. AT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- THAT- REGARDING THE NO BID CONTRACTS THAT ARE BEING ISSUED NOW AS- THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THE GOVERNOR IS PUT IN PLACE THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY AS IT LINGERS ON THERE'S TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NO BID STATE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED- WHAT OVERSIGHT OR AUDIT PROCESS DOES DGS HAVE IN PLACE- TO ENSURE THAT FRAUD WASTE ABUSE IS THINGS LIKE THAT ARE NOT OVERLOOKED ENTER THAT BECAUSE THESE. PROJECTS ARE PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED I GUESS AND IS THERE A PROCESS IN PLACE THE DTS HAS TO MAKE SURE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE STILL PROTECTED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION GROVE AND YES WE DO HAVE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES- ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES WE HAVE EXTREME LOADS OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. AT THE END OF HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE- THE COUNTERMEASURES WERE PUTTING OR SOME OF THE- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE ARE DEVELOPING AT THE CHEST AND PROMOTING. TO HELP. OUT WITH SOME OF THE CONTRACTING THAT IS OCCURRING UNDER EMERGENCY MEASURES SO THAT WE CAN- HAVE A LIST OF APPROVED VENDORS THAT WE CAN GO TO ON SOME OF. THESE ITEMS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY BEING PURCHASE BUT FOR OUR STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES THE ONES THAT ARE PROCUREMENT DIVISION FOLLOWS. OUR VENDORS ARE ASKED. TO PROVIDE A QUOTE WITH PRICING AND DELIVERED THE DELIVERY OF SCHEDULES- OF WHATEVER GOODS OR SERVICES THEY ARE GOING TO PROVIDE. THEY ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE PAID DATA- BUYERS. FROM THE EVALUATE COLD TO THE- IN RECENT PRICING. OUR BUYERS ALSO VALLEY P. EDE. WE MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN GOOD- WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK UP THE VENDORS IN OUR FISCALE SYSTEM. AND BUYERS FROM THE STATE NEGOTIATE WITH VENDORS ON PRICING PAYMENT TERMS AND DELIVERY AND DEPENDING ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CONTRACT- AND THE SIZE OF THE CONTRACTOR CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER WILL DISCUSS AND COLLABORATE. WITH- THE LEADERSHIP. AT THE UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP SO IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY CONTRACT AND WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE. OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ON THOSE EMERGENCY CONTRACTS OF A REGULAR CONTRACTS WE FOLLOW OUR REGULAR PROCEDURES THAT ARE NOT UNDER AN EMERGENCY CONTRACT SHALL WE CAN. YOU KNOW HAVE DONE TO ESTABLISH- SOME MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING IN CONTRACTS UNDER THESE EMERGENCY NEEDS THIS PROMOTE SMALL BUSINESSES AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IS BY HAVING A LIST OF APPROVED VENDORS. FOR ITEMS AND GOODS THAT ARE IN CONSTANT NEED ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BECAUSE OF OUR CONSTANT WILDFIRES AND WE HAD A REGISTRY OF ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS. AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES POSTED ON OCTOBER FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO NOW DEPARTMENTS CAN GO TO THAT LIST AND GO TO AN APPROVED. LIST OF VENDORS THAT HAVE BEEN VETTED- AND THAT WOULD PRECLUDE US HAVING TO DO THE SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS BECAUSE THESE VENDORS HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH A CERTIFICATION PROCESS. AND OUR BUYERS HAVE THAT IT THOSE VENDORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW YOU'VE ONLY BEEN IN THIS POSITION AND NOT YET A YEAR RIGHT. NOT YET A YEAR ALMOST THOUGH- BUT BECAUSE YOU CAME ON DURING THE CODED SITUATION WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU'VE LEARNED AND HOW YOU CAN IMPLEMENT THOSE TO CREATE. A BETTER QUALITY OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE GET FROM TGS. CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR AND I THINK THAT- I'M THE LIVING BREATHING EXAMPLE HYBRID WORK- AND I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE I AM THE DIRECTOR THAT'S ON THE ROAD. I'M GOING TO VISIT A LOT OF OUR SITE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ALONGSIDE SOME OF OUR FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION TEAM MEMBERS. UNDERSTAND WHAT A AY IN THE LIFE OF THEIR WORK IS LIKE. WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY- NO DOING SOME LANDSCAPING OF THE CAPITOL. PARK OR- WORKING IN ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS AND WORKING WITH OUR BUILDING ENGINEERS TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF THOSE EMPLOYEES. THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TELEWORK OR HYBRID WORK- SO AS THE DIRECTOR WHO'S ON THE CONSTANTLY ON THE ROAD AND ON THE GO. I'M TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS- WHAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE FACING HOW OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GETTING THEIR SERVICES WHETHER IT'S VIRTUAL OR IN THESE DIGITAL- PLATFORMS OR- CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF. AND IT'S GIVEN ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO TELEWORK AS EDS IS. THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TELEWORK POLICY IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR CALIFORNIA HUMAN. RESOURCES DEPARTMENT- I WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT FOLKS REALLY CARE TO BE SEEN OUR- EMPLOYEES- LOVE TO BE CALIFORNIANS. AND PTSIS REALLY THE FRONT DOOR TO THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHEN. SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU TO SAY HOW ARE WE DOING IT GOES A LONG WAY. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND% THROUGH THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS- AT HOW IS THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION RESPONDING TO THE RECENT BUREAU OF STATE AUDITS REPORT FINDINGS SUGGESTING THAT THE OFFICES. FIRST COME FIRST. AND SERVED PROCESS. HAS READ. IN INEQUITIES AND IN WHICH PROJECTS ARE FUNDED THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION IS CONDUCTING A VARIETY OF WORKSHOPS TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION IS. REACHING ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PROVIDING SUPPORT- TO THE SMALLEST OF DISTRICTS THE LARGEST OF DISTRICTS FOR FUTURE FUNDING AND CURRENT FUNDING CYCLES- AND WITH THAT I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE FULL FAITH IN THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND- WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN NEED. THANK YOU AM I LOOK FORWARD TO- SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION FROM ONE WOMAN WHO'S THE FIRST TO ANOTHER WOMAN WHO IS THE FIRST AND NOW THROWING IT BACK TO. THE FIRST FEMALE PRO TEM OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATIVE SENATE- FOR THE SENATE SO. AS I'M SURE SHE'S GONNA ENJOY SUPPORTING YOU AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU- SENATOR GROVE AND AUG I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS HI. I JUST WANTED TO ASK IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE OF THE GERMAN AND I'M MORE INTERESTED IN. OF PROCUREMENT AS IT RELATES TO HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY AND APPRECIATING WHAT SENATOR BROKE JUST SAID ABOUT THE FIRST WOMAN FIRST ENOUGH. YOU KNOW MY SPOUSE IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER- AND HAS A NUMBER OF THOSE DISTINCTIONS. NOT DISABLED VETERANS- WHICH IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO OTHER MINORITY OWNED. OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND. YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND- IS THAT. AND REALLY DIVERSITY AND DIVERSIFYING IT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. IS HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL IT IS IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENS THAT WHEN YOU MARRY THAT WITH THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW AND- FORGIVE ME SEEMINGLY BUREAUCRACY THAT HAS TO. HAS TO EXIST FOR MANY REASONS ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY OF PROCESS A FAIR PROCESS. HOW DO YOU BALANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS I'M SURE YOU APPROACH THIS JOB FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THE FIRST BUT- SECUREMENT WILL MAKE PEOPLE'S EYES GLAZE OVER AND I KNOW THAT THAT MY COLLEAGUES ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT- YOU KNOW PROCUREMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC IN EMERGENCY AND NON. COMPETE BUT JUST GENERALLY A PROCUREMENT A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THEIR FRUSTRATION. ABOUT THE LACK OF- OUR OUT REACH AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HAVING THOSE LISTS. OF PRE VETTED YOU KNOW JUST GIVE ME YOUR EXPERIENCE AND WHAT YOU SEE AND THEN THE RESPONSES FROM BUSINESSES WHO MAY REACH OUT AND SAY WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE STATE PROCUREMENT PROCESS I'M JUST CURIOUS. YOUR BROUGHT US THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW YOU INTEND TO. TRY TO HELP THAT ALONG. THANK YOU SO MUCH- DIMENSIONS FOR THAT QUESTION- IF YOU RECALL FROM MY OPENING STATEMENT THAT MY PARENTS HAD A SMALL BUSINESS AND WE'RE NEVER ABLE TO GET A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO EVEN NAVIGATE. IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM LET ALONE HOW TO BET ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY EASY- PROCESS HAD THEY HAD MORE ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT WAS READILY AVAILABLE IN A LANGUAGE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND- WITH WORKSHOPS SECOND WALK THEM THROUGH HOW TO DO THAT. RIGHT SO WHEN IT CAME TO D. J. S. HAVING BEEN A CLIENT FOR SO LONG AND- UNDERSTANDING THE PRIVILEGE OF LEADING. THE BUSINESS BACK HOME PHONE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. AND KNOWING THAT IN CALIFORNIA ARE SMALL BUSINESSES. REALLY ARE THE LIFELINE TO OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY AND RECOVERY I MET WITH MY ENTIRE TEAM AND I SAID. I'M GOING TO REALLY FOCUS ON THREE ELEMENTS AT EACH YES SUSTAINABILITY. LEVERAGING A REAL ESTATE TO- REACH MORE CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND CREATING EFFICIENCIES IN PROCUREMENT AND I SPOKE AND SAT DOWN WITH. OUR PROCUREMENT DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHE'S ALSO OUR CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER FOR THE STATE AND IS THAT HOW CAN WE MOVE THAT NEEDLE OF BEING MORE EFFICIENT. MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE HUMAN CENTRIC MEANING WE REALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW ARE SMALL BUSINESSES YOU KNOW WHEN THEY LOOK AT AN ART PIECE- THEY WALKING THROUGH THAT DOOR IT'S DAUNTING TO- EITHER GO THROUGH A CERTIFICATION OR RESPOND TO AN RFP. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S THAT TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION THAT THE CLASSICAL SO- SOME OF THE WORK WAS ALREADY BEING DONE AND I'M GLAD SHE AND I SAW I TO II. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN PROMOTING IS EIGHT TASK ORIENTED MEMO. OF THE VARIOUS ITEMS WE WANT TO DO TO MOVE THE. NEEDLE ON SMALL BUSINESS- AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTISAN. ONE THIS IS AN BRIDGE STREET FOR BUSINESSES THAT CAN PROVIDE SERVICES DURING EMERGENCIES THAT OPEN ON OCTOBER FIFTH- THE OTHER IS MOVING FORWARD WITH A VARIOUS ADVISORY COUNCILS AND REALLY LEANING ON SOME OF OUR LOCAL CHAMBERS AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS TO HELP US SHARE AND DISSEMINATE THE INFORMATION THE OTHER IS WORKING WITH OTHER VERY LARGE CITIES THAT HAVE STRONG CHAMBERS AND THAT ALSO NAVIGATE- THE SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENT PROCESS. FOR INDIVIDUALS AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN HAVE CROSS REGISTRIES FOR THOSE BUSINESSES OF YOUR BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN YOUR REGISTERED IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT THERE WOULD BE A CROSS REGISTRATION ACROSS A RECIPROCITY WITH THE STATE AND THAT THROUGH OUR SYSTEM KELLY PROCURE OR THEIR SYSTEMS THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO THE INFORMATION OF THE SAME. CONTRACTS THAT ARE BEING. SO WE ARE WORKING TO MOVE THAT NEEDLE I AM- I'M REALLY INTENT ON MOVING THIS FORWARD AND THEY PARTICIPATE A LOT IN THESE MEETINGS- WHICH IS NOT. ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF A DIRECTOR BUT IT BECAUSE I'M SO COMMITTED. TO SEEING THOSE DOORS OPEN AND OPEN MORE WIDELY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. I APPRECIATE THAT LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION REAL ALONG THOSE LINES. WHEN THERE IS SECUREMENT AND CONTRACTS AND SAY. MAYBE LARGER BUSINESSES GET THE AWARDS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEY HAVE- SUBCONTRACTORS. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHAT I'VE HEARD AT LEAST FROM SMALL BUSINESSES I KNOW THAT THEY GET SELECTED TO BE SUBS BECAUSE IT INCREASES THEIR DIVERSITY NUMBERS AND THEN THEY NEVER GET THE WORK OR THEY DON'T GET TO DO THE- SO YOU KNOW IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING WHEN A SMALL BUSINESS. PARTNERS WITH A LARGER. BUSINESS AND THE BENEFIT TO THE LARGER BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY IS THE DIVERSITY FACTOR AND YET DID THEY DON'T GET THE WORK. DONE HAVE YOU HEARD COMPLAINTS OF THAT NATURE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT SPECIFIC COMPLAINT BUT I AM HAPPY TO INFORM THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT OUR PROCUREMENT DIVISION DOES HAVE A TRACKING MECHANISM ESPECIALLY UPON PAIN. THE PRIME CONTRACTOR. ESPECIALLY IF THEY SAT OR THAT THEY HAD A DVD OR A SMALL BUSINESSES PART OF THIRTEEN. TO ENSURE THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS OR THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IS GETTING PAID AND PAID PROMPTLY AND THAT WERE SEEN THEM ALONG THE COURSE OF THE CONTRACT- SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN- I'VE- MADE. MY PREVIOUS POSITION I HEARD ABOUT IT ANECDOTALLY US SINCE COMING TO DIGEST I HAVE NOT BECAUSE NOW I KNOW THAT WE DO ACTUALLY TRACK IT IN OUR SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES. WHO ARE MINDING THOSE CONTRACTS ARE HELPING DEPARTMENTS MANAGE THOSE CONTRACTS REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION TO ENSURE WE'RE COUNTY- THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY AND THE SMALL THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE NUMBERS. THAT WE ARE REPORT NOT. THANK YOU. WELL I. THAT YOU COME WITH THE VALUE SET THAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THAT YOU ALSO REMINDED ME OF IN YOUR RESPONSE TO MY FIRST QUESTION AROUND PROCUREMENT- I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF EVER WE'RE GOING TO. DRILL DOWN IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FOCUS AND INTENTION AND YOU COME WITH THAT- PERSPECTIVES AND SO I APPRECIATE. THAT AND I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. THANK YOU IN THIS REGARD- SENATOR COM LONGER IS HERE- I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME SAY I HAD TO MEMBERS WHO HAD TO LEAVE AND GO TO BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE SO. HE HAS REURNED AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE OF IMPORTANCE TO HER SOMETHING TO TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR PROBLEM LONGER. EIGHTY MADAM FOR TEN AM IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MISS LAST SO- LAST LAST I SAW YOU WE ACTUALLY WERE BOTH AT EXPOSITION PARK- SAVING THE DAY THERE. SO I KNOW- SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ASKED ABOUT- BUILDINGS. AND SORT OF BUILDING SURPLUS SAYS THAT THE STATE- IS MANAGING. SO I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOLLOWING UP ON- ON THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT I HAVE THIS EVD BUILDING ON FIFTY FOURTH AND CURRENT JOB BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER BUILDINGS THAT ARE ALSO- THE STATE OWNED IN THE DISTRICT- THAT ARE HAVE BEEN DAYS MENTIONED OR THEY'RE NOT BEING UTILIZED X. CETERA. ONE OF THEM I THINK ON BROADWAY AND MAYBE FOURTEENTH IS- LOOKING AT BEING TURNED INTO HOUSING SO I'D JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU IF YOU CAN KIND OF SHARE. THE ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU KNOW STATE PRESENCE. VIS A VIS FACILITIES- AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU I RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A HUGE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. AND- LOS ANGELES. AND YET. YOU KNOW HAVING A STATE OWNED THE BUILDING. TURNED INTO HOUSING- COULD INFER TO PEOPLE THAT THE STATE IS NOT PRESENT- IN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF TOWN AND SO IF THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING YOU KNOW. WHAT'S THE ROLE WHAT ROLE IN MAINTAINING A PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE IT INTO HOUSING HOUSE THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED AND ENGAGED AND THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND IF THEY EVEN WANT IT AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE- AND IF THERE ARE IDEAS TO SORT OF RE OPEN FACILITIES BACK UP TO THEIR ORIGINAL INTENDED PURPOSE YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE- ULTIMATELY I THINK. CONSTITUENTS WANT TO SEE US. AND OFTENTIMES OF FACILITY. RIGHT WITH EMPLOYEES IN THERE HELPING YOU. IS THE BEST WAY TO VISUALLY EXERCISE YOUR PRESENT. SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE FACILITIES AND ULTIMATELY AN AMBASSADOR. TO THE STATE'S PRESENCE IN OUR DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA JUST WANT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE SORT OF MAINTAIN THAT. CENTER CALENDAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION I REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE LIKE YOU I TRULY BELIEVE THAT HAVING A PROPER BALANCE AND SPREAD. OF BOTH SERVICES AND AMENITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THOSE THAT. NEED ACCESS TO. BOTH THE SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES BUT ALSO TO THE AMENITIES LIKE PARKS AND HOUSING THAT ARE SO NEEDED. AND SO- TWO PARTS TO THIS ANSWER ON A ONE AND THE PROPERTY ON FIFTEENTH AND BROADWAY. ARE SLATED SURPLUS AND- IT WAS PUT OUT TO BID FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF- DDS PROVIDES SUPPORT IN TRANSACTIONAL ARM TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EFFORTS THAT- BE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IS MOVING FORWARD AND IN THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY HAS BEEN AWARDED SO I'M HAPPY TO REPORT SINCE THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS IT'S BEEN AWARDED. AMENDED THE DEVELOPER WILL BE CARRYING THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY DESIGN PLANS- MANY PLANS FOR THAT PARTICULAR SITE AND FIFTEEN THEN BROADWAY IS DEFINITELY AN AREA THAT NEEDS A LOT OF HOUSING NOW BALANCING THAT WITH OF THE VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE WISHES SERVICES IN ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND SEEN US ADVOCATE FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THOSE. SERVICES FOR. GOING TO THE PROP ON SHOP. DGS THE STEADFAST AND SUPPORTIVE OF EATING AND STAND TO PART WITH THEM TO- HELP RECOVER THAT PROPERTY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DEVELOPMENT AS OF TODAY AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO REPORT TO YOU- ON INTO FOR THE DGS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RECOVERING THAT PROPERTY AND ENSURING THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER SHE AND HER TEAM OF LAWYERS. WILL FILL THEIR OBLIGATION TO RETURN THE PROPERTY TO THE STATE WE WERE NOTIFIED THIS AFTERNOON THAT THE TITLE COMPANY RECEIVED SOME DOCUMENTS FROM THE FLOOR FORMER OWNER TODAY AND SO WE WILL BE REVIEWING THAT FOR THE COMPLETENESS AND THEN WORKING WITH EDT ON NEXT STEPS AND KEEPING YOUR OFFICE SURPRISED. SO I THINK THE WAY WE LOOK AT THIS- MOVING FORWARD IS ENSURING THERE'S A PROPER SPREAD ON ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S- YOU KNOW SO THERE'S DEPRESSED OR AND IF THEY'RE IF THEY HAVE ECONOMIC- NEED. THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO WALK TO SOME OF THESE RESOURCES OR- TAKE A SHORT BUS RIDE OR A SHORT DRIVE TO SOME OF THESE OFFICES AND IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AS WE LOOK AT OUR SURPLUS PROPERTIES AND THE INVENTORY THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO DO JUST FOR YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MY TEAM. TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE. ARE NOT LEAVING ANY GAPS. OF SERVICES AREA AND WHERE WE ARE TO FOR THAT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE LET. AND JUST ASK YOU ALL WHO REPRESENT THESE GREAT COMMUNITIES. THIS IS WHAT WAS THE MADE IN TERMS OF SURPLUS. THESE ARE THE OTHER LOCATIONS OF- GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN YOUR COMMUNITY. CAN YOU HELP US ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT MISSING ANY NOOK AND CRANNY IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO NO ONE GOES UNDER REPRESENTED.

I'M HONORED TO SERVE THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CAPACITY ALONGSIDE DIRECTOR LHASA. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU COME FROM MY- THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU MISS CLAIRE THIS IS QUITE A DAY FOR FIRST AND THE AND FOR WOMEN I MIGHT ADD. AND THEN WITH THAT I'M NOT GONNA LET SENATOR LET GO FIRST ON. I'M GONNA ASK VICE CHAIR. SENATOR BATES TO KICK US OFF WITH THAT WITH GREAT RESPECT TO THE ONE DOLLAR BILL IS THE ONE GENTLEMAN WITH. SENATOR GO AHEAD THANK YOU ALL MISS CLEAR- CAN. ON ALL. YOUR ROLL OUT OF OUR STATE ARCHITECT I COME FROM AN ARCHITECT FAMILY IN FACT MY HUSBAND GRADUATED FROM THE- USC SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE. MAYBE A DECADE AND A HALF BEFORE YOU STILL OUT THERE DOING DOING A LITTLE WORK. BETTER I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON PROCESS FIND I ACTUALLY KNOW IT PRETTY WELL WHILE BEING A PARTNER. OF SORTS FOR YOU KNOW THE BETTER HALF MAYBE OF THE ARCHITECT IN MY FAMILY THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN- YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT LOSING SOFT SKILLS ARE THEY PEOPLE SKILLS AND I'M- KIND OF WONDERING IF THEY'RE OUT TO BECAUSE- MOST OF OUR COMMUNICATION. WITH PEOPLE QUESTIONS- ON PROCESS OR PROBLEMS IF- NOT PEOPLE THE PEOPLE ARE FACE TO FACE COULD YOU KIND OF ELABORATE ON THAT I THINK IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT FLOW OF. AB ACROSS MANY OF OUR AGENCIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO SPEAK ON TO VOICE MAILS OR- YOU KNOW ZOOMING ZOOMING OVER BETTER THAN TELECONFERENCING BUT- ANYWAY- YOUR THOUGHTS. SURE ABSOLUTELY- THANK YOU FOR THE CALL- I WILL SAY THE- WHILE WE HAVE- YOU KNOW EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS IN PERFORMING OUR WORK WE'VE BEEN VERY TIMELY WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION SEAMLESSLY THROUGH TELEWORK- WHAT I NEED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SOFT SKILLS THAT OUR PROFESSION IS VERY- WELL OUR DEPARTMENT IS VERY CUSTOMER SERVICE ORIENTED. AND SO WE NEED OFTEN WITH OUR CLIENTS AND WERE USED TO ENGAGING WITH THEM IN PERSON AND I THINK THAT'S THE NATURE OF ALSO THE ARCHITECTURE PROFESSION IS GATHERING PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE AND SOLVING PROBLEMS TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY VIA TELEWORK BUT I THINK THAT- THERE IS A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES OF THE NEW PATIENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY- IT MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT AS WELL I THINK TO COMMUNICATE VIA TELEPHONE ONE WORLD WAR LYING ON OUR COMPUTERS TO DO THAT COMMUNICATION. BUT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW TROUBLESHOOTING THOSE ISSUES AS WE MOVE ALONG IN IN THE PANDEMIC AND NOW WE HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM FOR COMMUNICATION FOR COMMUNICATING ON PHONES BUT I STILL THINK THAT IT'S THE NATURE OF ALL OF US TO REALLY GATHER AROUND A TABLE AND SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER AND SO THAT'S RIGHT THEY GOT A HYBRID ENVIRONMENT REALLY STARTS TO MAKE SENSE IN TRYING TO CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE. TOGETHER WHEN WE NEED TO BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOT OF OUR WORK- REMOTELY WHEN WE CAN AND THEREFORE GET A BETTER BALANCE AND STILL DELIVERED THAT THAT CUSTOMER. SERVICE THAT WE SO VALUE. WHO YOU'RE IN TEN TO. OUT OF. FOR THE HYBRID ANY IN PERSON MEETINGS. CERTAINLY OUR VENDOR STAND THAT IN FACT I THINK IT. IT KIND OF REVERBERATES. THROUGH MANY MANY ON AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WHERE WE ARE. HAVING DIFFICULTY REALLY GETTING THE BACK AND FORTH THAT'S REQUIRED TO MOVE GOAL FORWARD INFO. FOR THE ISSUES SO WELL I THINK YOU FOR THAT- CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON YOUR NOMINATION AND YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT. FOR THE CONFIRMATION VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR SENATOR LAYER GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE FIRM AND I KNOW IT'S- LATE IN THE HEARING MAYBE IT WAS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE THE LAST BECAUSE WE WON'T. BE EXTENSIVE SO ARE I REALLY APPRECIATED YOU. A MEETING YESTERDAY MAYBE I'LL JUST US TWO THINGS ABOUT- THAT CAME UP IN OUR MEETING. ONE IS THAT. ARE YOU HAVE NEW ASSIGNMENTS THIS IS WHERE YOU DO SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW OF PROJECTS THAT COME BY YOU WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU DO THAT HOW THAT GOT ADDED TO. JUST WHAT THAT MEANS. SURE THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME YESTERDAY SENATOR LAYERED AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- AS THE SUSTAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND CAL GREEN BECOME- INCREASINGLY- I GUESS NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS SUSTAINABILITY SCHOOLS WE DO HAVE TO INSTILL A MESSAGE OF PLAN REVIEW THAT ACTUALLY ENSURES THAT THE LARGER MESHES MEASURES ARE ACTUALLY GETTING IMPLEMENTED OFTEN SOME OF THE MEASURES AND CAL GREEN ARE EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE- SEE IF PAINS OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE INSULATING MATERIALS THOSE ITEMS ARE PROLIFIC IN. CONSTRUCTION AND SO WE KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY HAVE TO INSTALL- THOSE TYPES OF MATERIALS IN BUILDINGS AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE EASY TO PROCURE EASY TO INSTALL IN THE BUILDINGS IN FACT THERE ARE THE PREDOMINANT SUPPLY THAT'S OUT THERE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED- LIKE SHADE TREES AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING THAT ARE SITE SPECIFIC AND THEY'RE TRIGGERED WHEN AN ACTION IS TAKEN EITHER YOU KNOW ON A PARKING AREA OR NEW PARKING AREA- OR ANY SITE IMPROVEMENT OR REHABILITATION OF LANDSCAPES AND SO WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE PROJECTS A LITTLE MORE CAREFULLY. AND ENSURE THAT WHEN IT'S NEEDED TO HAVE THE SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES INSTALLED THAT WERE ACTUALLY CHECKING TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS AND SO IT IS. A PROCESS THAT WE TAKE IN OUR INTAKE IF IT'S NOT INCLUDED AT INTAKE WE DON'T DELAY THE REVIEW BUT WE DO FLAG IT AND WE ASK THAT YOU DESIGN PROFESSIONAL TO COME BACK WHEN THEY COME BACK. WITH RETURN FROM THE COMMENTS THAT THEY PROVIDE THAT DOCUMENTATION PRIOR TO THE FINAL REVIEW SO OUR GOAL IS NOT TO NECESSARILY DELAY THE SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW NOR IS IT TO DELAY THE PROJECT IT'S TO ENSURE THAT IT'S INCLUDED AND TO GIVE THE DESIGN PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPLEMENT THE DRAWING SET IF IT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. WELL WE PROCEED WITH OUR REVIEW AND THEN CATCH IT- AT THE. END OF DURING BACK CHECK COM. AS THE- ELEMENTS IN CALGARY WILL BE LOW AT EACH OF THOSE ITEMS INCREMENTAL. THANK YOU I REALLY THAT NINE HOW THAT ADDED AND- IT HOW THAT'S NOT DONE AS A MATTER OF COURSE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT PROCESS. THE OTHER THING I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT IS THAT- IT IN THE COBWEBS OF MINE MINE DIED REMEMBER THAT FIFTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WAS A HUGE BACKLOG OF PROJECTS IN THE STATE ARCHITECT. AND THAT. HE A YOU KNOW AS A LEGISLATOR I GOT LOTS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WHAT WAS HOLDING UP BUSINESS. HOLDING UP CONSTRUCTION. THE THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS AND YOU INDICATED. BOB YESTERDAY IN OUR MEETING THAT IT'D BEEN ROUGHLY TEN YEARS SINCE THAT BACKLOG EXISTED AND ARMED WONDERED IF YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT. THAT BECAUSE THE THING I ASKED YOU WAS HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE. YOU NEVER START TO GET A BACKLOG AGAIN HOW DO YOU MONITOR IT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE ASKING FOR HELP IF THAT MATERIALIZES I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A KEY PART OF YOUR DEPARTMENT I. WONDERED IF YOU COMMENT ON THAT. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- NO I PREVIOUS THAT PREDECESSOR- HAVE SET IN PLACE OUR ELECTRONIC PLAN REVIEW PROCESS HOW ABOUT. I WANT TO SAY ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO NOW WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING PROCESS AND THEN AN ELECTRONIC PLAN REVIEW PROCESS SO WE ARE COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE ORGANIZATION WITHOUT REALLY ANY PAPER. AND DOES WHAT THAT APPOINTMENT PROCESS DID WAS IT GAVE THE SIX WEEKS AT THOSE DRAWINGS WOULD NORMALLY SIT AT DSA WAITING FOR REVIEW HE GAVE IT BACK TO THE DESIGN PROFESSIONAL SO NOW MUCH LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO THE PHYSICIAN AND YOU NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SHOW UP. FOR YOUR YOU KNOW HEALTH CHECK WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING THE DESIGN PROFESSIONAL HAS SIX WEEKS IN ADVANCE TO SCHEDULE THAT APPOINTMENT AND SCHEDULE A TIME TO HAVE THAT- PROJECT COMMAND WE TAKE THEM AT ALL TIMES. OF THE DESIGN PROFESSIONAL CAN SCHEDULE THAT SIX WEEK APPOINTMENT ANYTIME UNLIKE YOUR DOCTOR APPOINTMENT IT IS NOT LIKE YOU HAVE ONLY CERTAIN TIMES WHEN YOU CAN SUBMIT THEY JUST IT'S JUST THAT THEY CAN SUBMIT SIX WEEKS IN ADVANCE AND WE CAN PLAN SIX WEEKS IN ADVANCE SO WE HAVE A DASHBOARD. THAT WE LOOK AT OUR STAFFING MODEL AND LOOK TO SEE WHO IS WRAPPING UP A PROJECT AND START WE CAN START ASSIGNING THE PROJECT AS IT COMES IN BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROJECT IS AND WE KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE SUBMIT. AND THAT WAY WE CAN- KEEP TRACK OF OUR- ARE PLAN REVIEW PROCESS ON OUR DASHBOARDS EACH SUPERVISOR HAS A DASHBOARD BUT WE ALSO HAVE A METRICS- DEPARTMENT WHO ESTABLISHES REPORTS EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE GET THAT AS TO THE SUBMITTALS THAT ARE COMING IN. AND WHEN WE HAVE THAT SIX WEEK LOOK AHEAD WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOME OF OUR OTHER TOOLS IN ORDER TO ENSURE TIMELY PLAN REVIEW- IF OUR STAFF IS FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE PROJECTS THAT COME IN AND THOSE ARE CONSTRUCTION I'M SORRY CONSULTING CONTRACTING AND ALSO OVER TIME. AND WHILE WE LIKE TO RESORT TO THOSE- LAST WEEK DO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE STAFF IS BUSY AND WE TAKE PRIDE IN IN DOING THE WORK THAT AS WELL AS YOU DO- THEY ARE THEY DO GIVE US A OPPORTUNITY THAT. WE NEED TO WE CAN. REACH OUT TO WORK IN. AND SAY HERE GIVE US YOU KNOW- A TASK ORDER TO DEFINE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ROLE IS. HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST AND SO WHEN THAT PROJECT CONSENT WE CAN ASSIGN IT TO THEM IF WE ARE AT CAPACITY. SO WE DO HAVE METHODS TO ADDRESS OUR WORKLOAD AND WE TAKE PRIDE THAT WOMEN ARE PROJECTS COMES IN WE USUALLY GET TO IT WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THAT SUBMITTED. SOME MIDDLE DATE. AND PROCESS THAT THROUGH THROUGH THAT REVIEW AND AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED IF THERE ARE SOME POP ELEMENTS OF IT THAT ARE. MISSING WE INFORM THE CLIENT AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY EITHER TO IF IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE INITIAL REVIEW. TO PROVIDE IT TO US WITHIN. A TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOUR PERIOD OR IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW THAT'S A SUPPLEMENTAL DOCUMENT. GIVE THEM TIME TO WHILE IT'S IN REVIEW SUPPLEMENT THE DRAWINGS. SO THAT WE CAN KEEP PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR THAT. A DETAILED ANSWER AND I THINK THE THING FOR US IS TO SIT. OF RE INTERESTINGLY CONFIRMATIONS ARE ALSO THE CHANCE TO DO OVERSIGHT. AND SO. OUR THIS IS OUR WAY OF CHECKING INTO BACKLOGS WERE THE YOU HAVE LONG WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WOULD JUST SAY. THAT IF THERE'S EVER A TIME WHEN RESOURCES ARE SUCH THAT BACKLOG START TO ACCUMULATE TO HELP YOU WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH MARK THANK YOU. FOR YOUR RESPONSES I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR. SENT GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM FOR TEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CLAIRE HOW HOW ARE YOU I THANK YOU GOOD AND I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- JUST TO I PROBABLY WON'T TAKE AS LONG AS THEM THAT MY COLLEAGUE OF FORMER SECRETARY DID. M. BUT I DO. OKAY HE HAS ME ON A STOPWATCH SO I JUST I NOTICED IN YOUR WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THE RULES COMMITTEE- YOU SAID THAT YOU HAVE SOME- BUILDING STANDARDS IN ADMINISTRATION THREE XIN ADMINISTRATIVE RELATED REGULATIONS. THAT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE CERTIFICATION OF THE BOARD CONSTRUCTION OF MODERNIZATION I JUST NOTICED THAT. A COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT OR COULD YOU SHARE YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS. ABSOLUTELY SO THERE IS A REGULATION THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIA MINISTRY OF CODE THAT STATES THAT NGUYEN- THE SCHOOLS PERFORMING MODERNIZATION. AND THAT MODERNIZATION ARRIVES AT VALUE- THEN IT TRIGGERS A FULL. UPGRADE FOR THE STRUCTURAL SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT. AND SO FOR A LOT OF THESE HISTORICAL BUILDINGS- IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ON THE BUILDING BUT THIS COULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT THAT WAS A PLAN FOR BY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO WHERE WE USED TO SEE THIS HAPPEN- PERHAPS MAYBE ONCE A YEAR WE ARE NOW SEEING APPROXIMATELY TEN PROJECTS A MONTH WHERE THIS IS OCCURRING. IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE AND SO. WHAT THAT TENDS TO DO OBVIOUSLY DERAIL YEARS OF PLANNING THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE PERFORMED AND A LOT OF THIS REASON IS BECAUSE THE- COST OF CONSTRUCTION FLUCTUATE SO GREATLY AND SO IF THEY'RE PLANNING VERY CLOSE TO THAT 50% MARK. THEN THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING THAT COST ESTIMATE COULD REALLY SEND IT OVER THE MARK AND THEN CREATE ALL THIS ADDITIONAL WORK. YEAH SO- WE DIDN'T WANT TO- WE NEED TO WE REALIZE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS REGULATION THAT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A WHILE AND SEE HOW WE CAN EITHER ADJUSTED FOR IMPROVEMENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE. THE STRUCTURAL SAFETY WE NEED BUT ALSO ADDRESS RESILIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR DSA TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE SUSTAINABLE ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND THEN WE HAVE A REGULATION THAT MAY ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY DEMOLISHED BUILDING IN ORDER TO PROCEED. BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BUILD A NEW ONE- OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT VERY- IT DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S A VERY CARBON INTENSIVE. YEAH SO WE HAVE ARRANGED A TASK FORCE THAT ACTUALLY OUR FIRST MEETING WILL BE MARCH NIGHT- WE'VE ENGAGED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH ARCHITECTS WITH- STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AS WELL. AND WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER AND TRYING TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PROCESS CAN WE HAVE HE TRIGGER POINTS THAT MAYBE WE DO. THAT THAT THE PROJECTS NOT SO VOLATILE DEPENDING ON THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS RIGHT OR- JUST YOU KNOW THE REGULATION ITSELF THAT SAYS LET'S PRIORITIZE SAFETY BUT IT'S LOST A LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY RESILIENCY AND HOW CAN WE WRITER REGULATIONS SO THAT. OUR SCHOOLS CAN BETTER PLAN BUT THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE SAFE WHEN THESE FACILITIES ARE MODERNIZE. SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL OF THIS PROCESS WE USE TASK FORCES BEFORE- I'VE IMPLEMENTED TWO OR THREE OF MY TIME AT TSA. THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AN EXPLORATION OF THE PROJECT TOGETHER AND THE PROBLEM TOGETHER AND LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW WHERE WE WHERE WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WERE MEETING THAT GOAL WHICH IS TO TRY TO SAVE SOME OF OUR EXISTING FACILITIES. TRY TO MAKE THEM STRUCTURALLY SAFER TRY TO MAKE THEM MORE SUSTAINABLE AND TRY TO DELIVER THESE PROJECTS ON TIME FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T NEED TO ASK MY SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE IT WAS- HAVE YOU ENGAGED IN A PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS REGULATORY PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO BE. PROHIBITING SCHOOLS FROM BEING ABLE TO DO A MODERNIZATION WITHOUT TEARING DOWN COMPLETE BUILDINGS. AND YOU HAVE AND YOU GAVE A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR IT SO I AM FINISHED I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONFIRMATION. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH SENATOR COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AYE- JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- ARM AN APOLOGIES IF MAYBE YOU TO ADDRESS THIS EARLIER AND JUST- AS IT RELATES TO THE CAL GREENE RULEMAKING PROCESS THESE- HAVE YOU CONVEYED YOUR FRUSTRATION AT THE SLOW NESS OF IT. WELL THE PROCESS ITSELF IS STEPS THAT STATUTE AND I THINK IT'S NOT THAT IT'S- A SLOW PROCESS SO MUCH IS THAT THE LENGTH OF THE ROCESS- TENDS TO. FLUCTUATE THE ENGAGEMENT- BUT THE PROCESS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR US TO DO OUR OUTREACH BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE REGULATIONS ON AN EIGHTEEN MONTH CYCLE. AND SIX MONTHS OF THAT TIME IS REALLY WORKING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WHETHER WHICH WOULD BE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND ENGAGING WITH THEM AND LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE WHY WE'RE DOING IT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO COST ANALYSES SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF PACKAGE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT. AND IT ONCE IT ONCE WE DO OUR INITIAL PRE CYCLE OUT REACH- AND WE ESTABLISH WHAT THE REGULATIONS ARE AND THEN THERE IS A WHOLE NOTHER FORMAL PROCESS THAT GOES THROUGH BUILDING STANDARDS AND THERE'S OTHER CHECKPOINTS TO ENGAGE. AND IT'S TRYING TO DRAW THEM BACK INTO THOSE CHECKPOINTS TO ENGAGE BECAUSE AS WE RECEIVE COMMENTS WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE REGULATION- SOMEWHAT. AND SO IT'S REALLY TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE SCHOOLS AND SAY HERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO COMMENT HERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATE. COME JOIN US COMING FORM AND IT'S- DEPENDING ON BECAUSE IT'S EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS DEPENDING ON HOW BUSY ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ESPECIALLY RECENTLY WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO AT THE START OF SCHOOL OR YOU KNOW IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER AND THAT'S WHEN THAT TIME FALLS AND THEY'RE VERY BUSY WITH CONSTRUCTION ON THEIR CAMPUSES. SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER TO GET THEIR ATTENTION SO WHILE. THE PROCESS IS- YOU KNOW SECONDS. PRETTY MUCH A STATUTE AND THERE'S A REALLY GOOD REASON FOR IT IT'S REALLY US TRYING TO. ELICIT THEIR ENGAGEMENT TO KEEP THEM INTERESTED SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF WHAT'S COMING IN THE FUTURE. GOT IT THANK YOU AG IS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT SOME TIME IN THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT- I. AM ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WAYS. THAT WE CAN SORT OF ENERGIZED OUR PROCESS EASIER SORT OF ACTIVATE THEM IN A WAY THAT- KEEP THINGS CURRENT BECAUSE- DISTRICTS ARE. TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THEIR FACULTY AND THEIR STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD. IN A WAY THAT IS- SUITABLE FOR THE KIND OF- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON CAMPUSES. BUT THEN YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH COSTS AND OTHER KINDS OF CONSTRAINTS AND TIME CAN IMPACT ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND THEN IT ENDS UP YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S BUILT. IN YOU'RE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL AGAIN AND SO- YOU KNOW ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WAYS THAT WE CAN SORT OF STREAMLINED AND ACTIVATE THESE PROCESSES FOR FULL ENGAGEMENT BUT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. YOUR RESPONSE I HAVE NOTHING ELSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CALM WATER THIS IS BEEN A REALLY INFORMATIVE- CONVERSATION SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OTHER THAN TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE.
