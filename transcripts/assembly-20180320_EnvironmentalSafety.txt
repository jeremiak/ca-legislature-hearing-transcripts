COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF EXPRESS CONCERNS REGARDING THAT REGULATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES. ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES IS THE BAD RECYCLING PLANT OPERATED BY EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CITY OF BURN AND. AND SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO GO UNCHECKED FOR OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS DUE TO LAX PERMITTING. AND ENFORCEMENT. THE RESPONSE OF THIS AND OTHER ADVANCED LEGISLATURE INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PUBLIC RESOURCES BUDGET TRAILER BILL. A REQUIREMENT THAT DTS HE ESTABLISHED INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL TO REVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING IMPROVEMENTS TO DTS SEIZE PERMITTING. ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC OUTRAGE AND FISCAL MANAGEMENT.

IN THE PURSUE ALL OTHER. PERMITTED HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR. REGULAR MORE FREQUENT SPECTRES CAN HELP AVOID EXPOSING THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT A HARMFUL TOXINS. AB TWENTY NINETY FOUR WILL HELP ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS ARE DISCOVERED QUICKLY AND FACILITIES ABOUT BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. THEREBY MINIMIZING HARM TO NEARBY COMMUNITIES.

IF THOSE YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BELL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON KEPT KEY WITH MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU IN OPPOSITION FORTUNATELY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. C. MTA AND OTHER COALITION LED BY THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER I AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. ARE CONCERNED AND UNFORTUNATELY IT MUST OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINETY FOUR. AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT TIME ESTABLISHING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON DTS SEE WHEN THEY ARE IN PROCESS OF MOVING FORWARD A HOST OF DIFFERENT REFORMS. ARE REGULATORY PACKAGES AND WHAT HAVE YOU ARE CURRENTLY FOR THEIR X. CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST IMPACTS OF THIS WILL HAVE. ON AN BURDENS HANNAH AGENCY THAT AGAIN IS SEEKING TO APPROACH FOR WITH A HOST OF REFORMS. FURTHER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. ABOUT SO IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL AND OTHER FORUMS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING OUT TO ANY REFORMS TO THE DEPARTMENT AYE IN A HOLISTIC FASHION. A WE ARE CERTAINLY AS ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY CERTAINLY VERY INTERESTED IN THAT DISCUSSION ARM AND HAVE ENDEAVOR TO PUT FORWARD OUR SUGGESTIONS. RELATED TO ITEMS THAT WE DO THINK IT WOULD HELP FURTHER. COULD HAVE A PROTECT COMMUNITIES ENSURE WORKABLE APPROACHES AND ENSURE THAT SELL OUTS CALIFORNIA WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN AN APPROACH THAT DOES ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR OWN HAZARDOUS WASTE. OF VERSES ARE SOLELY SEEKING TO MOVE OUT OUT OF STATE HAVE WE ARE CONCERNED AGAIN ABOUT. DOT AND FURTHER WOULD NOTE THAT TIME JUST LAST YEAR AS PART OF A TWO YEAR COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS. DGSE ON AND TOOK ON A REVIEW OF ITS OPERATIONS RELATIVE TO ENFORCEMENT AND AS PART OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT OFFERED TO A CAME FORTH WITH A HOST OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO BOTH EFFORTS ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS INSPECTION PROCESS SEES. OTHER WORKING TOWARDS MOVING SOME OF THOSE PIECES FORWARD ON INCLUDING I'M USING A CALLIN VIRO SCREEN RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY IMPACTS IDENTIFYING THOSE. PRIORITIZING INSPECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE THROUGH THE USE OF THAT OUR TOOL. AGAIN ULTIMATELY WE'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THIS APPROACH ON MAO'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED ON ABSENTEE VERY OF FOCUSED RISK BASED ON COMPLAINTS HISTORY BASED APPROACH VERSUS JUST ON SEEKING. A VERY STRICT NUMBER OF MINIMUM INSPECTIONS ON MAY NOT BE THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES MANIA PROVIDE AND DON INSTITUTE FOR THE BURDENS. ON THE AGENCY WITHOUT NECESSARILY HOW THE CORRESPONDING ARE BENEFICIAL IMPACTS THE PROTECTION OF THAT I THINK WORLD LOOKING FORCE WITHOUT MUCH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. A BIT TOO AGAIN. AND WISH TO CONVEY OUR INTEREST IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION ON REFORMS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MORROW BEHALF OF CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS ITS SUBSIDIARY SAFETY CLEAN WHICH TOGETHER HAVE. FOURTEEN UP PERMITTED FACILITIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA A TO KEEP IT BRIEF THOUGHT MY MY REMARKS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY ELECT ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE REMARKS. THAT MISS KEPT HE MADE ON BEHALF OF HER CLIENTS MAKE IT REAL QUICKLY IN ADDITIONAL COST YOU'D STILL QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO IN TERMS OF THE FOCUS IN TERMS OF PRIORITIES WITH REGARDS INSPECTIONS. AND AGAIN DEEPER SHE'S AS AS WAS KEPT HE SAID I MEAN WE JUST GOT THROUGH FIT WE COLLECTIVELY. THE LEGISLATURE A PAID FOR A ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR A EVALUATION THAT DGSE HAS RECENTLY. UP CONCLUDED AND HAS ADOPTED A NUMBER OF UPDATED A NUMBER OF ITS POLICIES INCLUDING INSPECTIONS ENFORCEMENT POLICIES I THINK A BILL LESTER DID TO HAVE. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE. EDUCATE THAT THE MEMBERS HERE AS WELL AS A STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF THAT PROCESS AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH REGARD TO UPDATING THEIR POLICIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE EDUCATING THEIR STAFF. THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INSPECTIONS ARE ARE CONSISTENT AND CONDUCTED IN THE MATTER UPON WHICH WE ALL EXPECT THANK YOU CURRENT. THANK YOU ARM WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW ESTABLISH A FORUM AND THEN WE'LL GET BACK TO MISTER CALDERON WHO WHO'S EXPERT WITNESS HAS ARRIVED. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. QUIRK. HERE CHEN. I RUMBULA. BRO. FRIEDMAN. REALLY HERE HOLDEN. WHAT'S WHICH. SO WE HAVE A QUORUM. WE HAVE A QUORUM. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. FOR TAKING THE TIME TAPE FEE OUR SUBSTITUTE DE PINCH HITTER TODAY. ALRIGHT. MISTER CALDERON YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOUR. EXPERTS. A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF WE HAVE WITH US INTO INGRID ROSTRUM THE SENIOR ATTORNEY THE CENTER ON RACE PROPERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK YOU OUT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. FOR SEVERAL REASONS OF FIRST OF WHICH. IS THIS BILL COMES FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE I RP THIS IS OF COURSE A BODY THAT TOOK TWO YEARS. A LOOKING CLOSELY AT EVERY AT EVERY PROGRAM AREA ON AND DEVELOP THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE I RP. DID INCLUDE RISK BASE FACTORS AS ENHANCE MY CRITERIA FOR INSPECTIONS AND REALLY BY RECOGNIZING THAT OF FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED NEAR EDICT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. A SHOULD BE A SHOULD HAVE PRACTICES ON THAT OR MORE PROTECTIVE THAN NOT US SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE ENHANCE PERMITTING CRITERIA FOR INSPECTION CRITERIA. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND INCLUDING OTHER RISK FACTORS AS WELL. I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION. IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED IS THAT A D. TSC OR THIS BILL. CODIFIES MUCH OF WHAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED. OR REQUESTED FROM EPA ON AND. SO THIS BILL DOESN'T DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE AMOUNT OF INSPECTIONS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BUT DOES SAID IN STATUTE ARE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. I'M DGSE IS AN AGENCY THAT HAS ON MANY ISSUES. WITH PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND ALSO WITH CONSISTENCE CONSISTENCY. ACROSS FACILITIES US SO WE DO WANT TO SEE. THERE TO BE A A CODIFICATION OF INSPECTION RECORDS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A STANDARDIZED PROCESS ESPECIALLY SINCE OF PERMITTING DECISIONS ARE BASED IN PART ON COMPLIANCE HISTORY. AND LOOKING AT PAST VIOLATIONS WITHOUT A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE OF INSPECTIONS ACROSS ALL THE FACILITIES ON IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO HAVE A FAIR MEASURING STICK UPON WHICH TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE HISTORY. ON I JUST ALSO WANT TO NOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF INSPECTIONS ON ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT. FACILITIES ARE COMPLIANT NIKITA COMMUNITIES I'M AND IF THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THERE IS A SPEEDY. ON AND FULL A RETURN TO COMPLIANCE SO THAT WE'RE NOT FACED WITH SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHEN THERE ARE COMPLAINTS. BUT ISSUES AT THESE FACILITIES AND THEY'RE NOT DISCOVERED AT LEAST TWO VERY REAL IMPACTS AND VERY REAL ECONOMIC HARM TO THE TO THE STATE AND OF COURSE REAL A HEALTH IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE NEARBY. OKAY THANK YOU. FARM. LET'S SEE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. OR LITTLE GOING A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER THAT TASK. THANK YOU CHAIR TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. A OPPOSED FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY. IS KEPT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M. BUT SEE. MISTER VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY. OF. OTHER MEMBERS. ALRIGHT YOU MAY CLOSE A. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COUNT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ENDS UP I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF. NOT JUST BUT FLORA THIS YEAR BUT LAST YEAR AS WELL A WORK MOVEMENTS CLOSELY. I'D HAVE A BILL THAT DID SUCCESSFULLY MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. OUR MY AND HE GOT VERY POSITIVE LE CLUB CONVERSATION OF GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OPEN THE REAR END IS THE BELT THAT WEREN'T THE CASE. AND I I. FEEL STRONGLY. THAT THIS BILL AS WELL AS WELL IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER BILLS ARE ALSO MAKING THEIR WAY. THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS AN IMPORTANT. STEP THAT WAS HAVING BETTER UP BUT OVERSIGHT OF THESE FACILITIES AND AS NOTED A BY. MY WITNESS HERE TO MY LEFT. I'M. IN OF THE THIS IS CODIFYING MUCH OF WHAT THE EPA REQUIRES AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THERE'S BEEN SOME ROLL BACKS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULES REGULATIONS SO IT'S MORE IMPORTANT NEVER THAT BE IS A STATE ACTUALLY QUALIFY WHAT. IT IN MANY WAYS HAS BEEN. THE STANDARD. IN RECENT YEARS AND FIND WAYS TO ACTUALLY BEEN STRENGTHENED OUR ABILITY TO. AND PROVIDE FOR. SAFE OF ENVIRONMENTAL BURKE PLACES AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND AND I'M GRATEFUL AND RESPECTFUL OF THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF BEING OPEN TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. AVOCADOS WHETHER WE GOT THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD OR NOT THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT A LOT TO WORK WITH AND SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT. OF THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. AND I I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK. OKAY SO ARE I WILL SAY FIRST WHILE THE OPPOSITION RACISM CORRECT CONCERNS DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. ARE YOU IS THIS GOING TO BE PART OF A FULL PACKAGE. ARE HOW WELL DOES IT FIT. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. AND ARE I HAVE FULL FAITH THAT THEY WILL. MAKE SURE THAT IF THIS BILL DOES GO FORWARD THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE FUNDING IN THAT IT FITS INTO THE WHOLE. UP PACKAGE HAD THEREFORE I WILL RECOMMENDED I ON THIS AND. DO BELIEVE THAT. THEY'LL BE. MORE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION PARTICULAR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS PART OF. OF THE WHOLE REFORM PACKAGE AND IS WELL IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THAT HAS APPROPRIATE FUNDING SELLERS RURAL CONCERNS THAT I SHARE WITH THE. OPPOSITION AND I'M SURE I SHARE WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL SO. ARE AGAIN I GIVE THIS AND I VOTE AND. MADAM SECRETARY WOULD YOU LET'S SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FOR A BI TWENTY NINETY FOUR. GOOD. ALRIGHT AND THEN MADAM SECRETARY YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS A. B. TWO ZERO NINE FOR KALRA THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE CHEN. CHEN NO ARAMBULA. PRO. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN. MATTEUCCI. MATTEUCCI I. WILL HOLD ITS. ALRIGHT WE HAVE. AND NEED FOR ONE MORE VOTE. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU WELL THANK YOU SHARE. OKAY. A MS RANTS I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO HEALTH COMMITTEE SO PLEASE COME UP AND. BRING YOUR BALL FORWARD. SO WE ARE LOOKING ASKED. A. B.. TWENTY THREE FORTY FIVE HIGHS HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY PERMITS A. B.. TWENTY THREE FORTY FIVE REQUIRES AN OWNER OPERATOR FOR PERMITTED HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION FOR RENEWAL TWO YEARS BEFORE THE PERMIT EXPIRES. AGAIN THIS WAS A BILL OF THAT THE GOVERNOR. LOOKING AT THE FULL OP PICTURE OF WHAT HE WANT TO DO THAT RELUCTANCE TO MOVE FORWARD LAST YEAR. WE BELIEVE THAT. THAT AS WE LOOK AT THIS IN THE NEXT YEAR THAT THAT THERE IS HOPE THAT THIS WILL. GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN AND BE SITE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FIVE. AS YOU'VE INDICATED IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT REQUIRES AN APPLICANT FOR THE RENEWAL OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY TO SUBMIT FOR REVIEW AT LEAST TWO YEARS BEFORE ITS EXPIRATION. FOR PERMITS EXPIRE AFTER JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN ADDITION THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE. CONTROLLED TO POST ON ITS WEBSITE. AND IT'S ESTIMATED TIMELINE OF KEY MILESTONES IN THE REVIEW PROCESS. DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERMITTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN HAZARDOUS WASTE. AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW'S BROWN UNDER MUCH SCRUTINY OVER THE YEARS DUE TO A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. ISSUES WITHIN TERM PERMITS THAT HAVE LASTED DECADES. AND AN INABILITY TO COMPLETE TASKS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN RESPONSE TO THESE PROBLEMS A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT CREATED AND INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL TO OVERSEE THE DEPARTMENT'S PERMITTING. ENFORCEMENT AND FISCAL MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PANEL WAS TO REQUIRE PERMIT APPLICATIONS. TO REQUIRE PERMIT APPLICANTS TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICANT. INFORMATION ON A TIMELY BASIS AND THE STAB WISH ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS. THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES BOTH OF THESE GOALS BY REQUIRING AN EARLIER REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. TO BOTH FACILITIES AND OF THE COMMUNITY BY MANDATING THAT DTS SEE. POST A TIME LINE OF ESTIMATED DATES OF KEY MILESTONES. IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS INGRID ROSTRUM WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU ARM AND WE ARE AGAIN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AS PART OF THE IEP PACKAGE. AGAIN THIS A ENTITIES ARE REVIEW PANEL WILL TAKE TOOK A CLOSE LOOK I'M OVER TWO YEARS ON AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD HELP PROTECT. RESIDENTS LIVING NEARBY HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES. I WILL NOTE THAT DTS SEE HAS. BEEN CRITICIZED LONG CRITICIZED FOR THE NUMBER OF EXPIRED PERMITS. AT A CERTAIN POINT AND I AM I DON'T THINK THIS NUMBER HAS DECREASED THAT MUCH BUT AS MUCH AS A THIRD OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE OPERATING UNEXPIRED PERMITS. AND THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN ON MUCH ATTENTION PLACED ON THIS ISSUE ARE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE. DONE IN THE WAY OF REALLY ROLLING BACK THIS BACKLOG. I AM I WILL NOTE THAT OF THE FACILITY THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING THE LONGEST ON AN EXPIRED PERMIT. HAVE A HAS ITS FIBER TECH IN LOS ANGELES AND THAT PERMIT EXPIRED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THIS GIVES YOU SOME INDICATION OF ONE ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS THE DTS HE HAS MADE ON THIS ISSUE. AND TO JUST THE JUST THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND IN FACT IN THISCASE DECADES ARM. A THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. ARM. THE CURRENT LAW IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THIS EXPIRED PERMIT ISSUE BECAUSE BY DETAILS HIS ESTIMATION IT TAKES AT LEAST TWO YEARS TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS. SO FOR NOT RECEIVING APPLICATIONS UNTIL THE PERMIT IS NEAR EXPIRED BY DESIGN WERE ALLOWING AND WE'RE PROMOTING IS A FACILITIES OPTED TO OPERATE ON THE SIX BY PERMITS AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY. HAVING CURRENT PERMITS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO RESIDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE IT PROMOTES A UP TO DATE MITIGATION MEASURES IT PROMOTES UPTODATE STANDARDS. ARM AND IT ALLOWS THE DTS HE TO LOOK AT COMPLIANCE HISTORY AND VIOLATIONS AS PART OF ITS PERMITTING DECISIONS SO THESE DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE IN A TIMELY WAY. AND WE SHOULD THEREFORE. PROCESS TO ALLOW THE TNC TO MAKE TIMELY PERMIT DECISIONS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. ARM. ARE THERE OTHER IN SUPPORT. A MORENO ON THE OFFICE HERE COULD CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. RANDALL FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF FOUR NAVIENT THREE AIRFORCE PERMITTED FACILITIES IN SUPPORT WE WOULD LIKE WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH TURNING IN OUR APPLICATIONS TWO YEARS EARLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE BILL GO FURTHER AND ACTUALLY. HAVE A MARK UP FORCING PROCESS SO WE COULD GET OUR PERMIT WITHIN THE TWO YEARS WE DON'T WANT OPERATE WITH EXPIRED PERMITS EITHERAND AND THAT. I'M. WITH THAT CONCEPT WE'VE CERTAINLY SUPPORT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING BEER MANY ISSUES INVOLVED. THANK YOU. ANDREA ENTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. THE AND ABOUT HIS WITH CALIFORNIA I'M TO JUSTICE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT AND A FEELING WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST. THE RALLY ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP IS ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PLANKING GETTING THIS AGENCY IMPORTANT AGENCY UP TO SNUFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT AN ACCENT ON BEHALF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALL NEXT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. AND. I HAVEN'T SAID THIS BEFORE BUT IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR MARKS TO ABOUT FOUR MINUTES MAXIMUM I E. YOU YOU DID I'M SURE YOU WILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN CHRIS ABOUT THE HELP OF A CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND SAFETY CLEAN. I THINK WE CAN ALL IN THIS ROOM AGREE THAT THAT. THE DTS IF WE CAN GET DETAILS SHE TO PROCESS PERMITS FASTER WE WOULD ALL BE. THE BETTER FOR IT I THINK THE CONCERNS THAT MY CLIENT HAS WITH REGARDS TO THIS BILL IN THIS AND THIS A IT WITH ALL THE YOU KNOW. WE HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE SINCERITY. OF THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS A PROPONENTS. A. REQUIRING REQUIRING A PERMIT APPLIQUE IT TO SUBMIT A PERMIT TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE THAT'S ALL FINE AND WELL. BUT THE REALITY IS IS THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE DTS SEED TO DO ANYTHING MORE WITH REGARD TO KEEP TO PROMULGATING THAT PERMIT AND AS. I REPRESENTING A CLIENT WHO'S DEALING WITH DTS SEE WITH A NUMBER OF PERMIT RENEWALS. AT THIS POINT AND SOME OF THEM THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN BEEN IN STACEY'S FOR IT FOR MANY MONTHS NOW. IT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT THE THERE'S THIS EXPECTATION THAT IF THE APPLICANT SUBMIT THEIR PERMITS TWO YEARS EARLY THAT SOMETHING. MAGICAL IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THOSE PERMITS ARE GOING TO BE PROCESS THE QUICKER MATTER AND AND THEY'RE JUST NOT AND AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND INCLUDING A AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR OF A. COST. COSTS COSTS OF THE PERMIT ESTIMATES. THAT'S A HUGE HUGE ISSUE WITH AND WITH REGARD TO MY CLIENT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER APPLICANTS THEY HAVE THEIR PERMIT RENEWALS AND PROCESS SO. WHY WE WILL RECOGNIZE? THE NOTE THAT DESIRE TO SEE. PERMITS. GO THROUGH THE PROCESS QUICKER. I THINK THERE'S IS THERE'S THIS EXPECTATION THAT THAT THAT THE LOG JAM IS GOING IS GOING TO BREAK WITH REGARDS TO BILLS LIKE THIS AND AND THE REALITY IS IS EVEN WITH REGARD TO THE I RP RECOMMENDATION. THE COMPLETE I OR P. RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARD TO THIS PERMITTING. WAS REQUIRED IDIOCY OBTAIN FULL COST RECOVERY CONNECTED WITH THIS HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY PERMIT DECISIONS THE DTS HE REPORTS THAT THE DTS HE'S EXISTING. ARE A. S.. WELL THAT THAT THE IRE P. RECOMMENDED THAT THAT THAT THAT DTS SEE ALSO BE. PUT ON NOTICE WITH REGARDS TO MOVING THOSE THOSE PERMITS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT SOME ACTIONS IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITH REGARD TO EITHER. APPROVAL OF THE PERIMETER DENIAL OR BEGINNING OF THE DENIAL OF THE PRIMITIVE IF THE ACTION DOESN'T DOESN'T TAKE PLACE SO AGAIN THIS BILL TAKES CARE OF ONE SIDE OF THE LEDGER BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER WITH REGARDS TO THE ACTIONS THAT THE. DEPARTMENT IS TO DO TO PROMULGATE THOSE PERMITS IN A. IN A TIMELY MANNER. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT. STERN VICE CHAIR NO QUESTIONS ARE. OTHER MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. THOUGHT HERE WE GO ANOTHER PERSON AND YOU IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. NEITHER AND BOTH. TOM NINE. TOM JACOB WITH THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE JUST WHERE TO REGISTER ON THIS BILL WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WE'RE NOT SURE THAT IT. GETS US WHERE WE NEED TO GO FOR THE REASONS THAT CHRIS OUTLINED. A ON THE OTHER HAND. WE DO FEEL IT'S DO IT DEALING WITH SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES. A AND. WILL HAVE TO PROCESS IT FURTHER AS IT MOVES FORWARD BUT. I JUST WANTED TO REGISTER THAT. OKAY GIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD ALSO WELL LET'S HEAR FROM THE OTHER MEMBERS DOES ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT. ALRIGHT ARM. THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FRANCE. AT. MY MYERS WE GET A MOTION NOW WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO MAKE MOTION. OKAY A ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST ONE STEP. CLEARLY WERE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM BUT I THINK IF THE SMALL STEPS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK THE. THE CLARITY THAT'S BEING OFFERED IN THE BILL AS WELL AS TIME LINES THERE ISN'T A PERFECT SOLUTION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'RE THERE'RE TEMPS ON BOTH SIDES TO TRY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK IF WE DON'T TAKE. SMALL STEPS WILL NEVER GET TO THAT POINT. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY AGAIN. THE GOVERNOR IS. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT. WE DO SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE CONCERN IF FIVE DOESN'T HELP TO HAVE THE. HAVE A TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE OF IT THEN TAKES TEN YEARS TO. TO CERTIFY OR TWENTY. BOB THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALL WANT TO AVOID. IT IS MY. OPINION IN TALKING WITH BARBARA LEAD THE NEW HEAD OF THE A THE DTS SEE. AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT THIS IS A DEDICATED GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. SO A LARGE PART OF. MOVING US FORWARD AND ALL OF US WANT DECISIONS FASTER WHETHER YOU'RE FOR OR AGAINST THE FACILITY. AND A LARGE PART OF THAT HAS TO COME THROUGH THE BUDGET. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL SEE CHANGE IN THE BUDGET IN THE MAY REVISE. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID I'M SURE THAT. YOU'RE WORKING WITH GOVERNORS OFFICE AND WE WILL LOVE. BRING THIS FORWARD AGAIN IF WE CAN COMBINE THIS WITH MORE RESOURCES SO THAT THE BILL SO THAT. THE JOB. DECISIONS CAN BE MADE IN A MORE TIMELY MATTER IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. SO OP WITHOUT HAVING AYE RECOMMENDATION MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS AB TWO THREE FOUR FIVE ANDREAS THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE CHEN. CHEN AYE ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I WROTE. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN.

ARAMBULA BY WROTE. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I HOLDEN. HOLDEN I WENT SEARCHING RHETORIC. TARGET. THE NEXT THREE BELLS ARE MINE. CHAU. MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU I'M GONNA BE TAKING THESE IN NUMERICAL ORDER SO I HOPE YOU'RE ALL SITTING HALF. SO AB NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND A. TWENTY SEVENTY TWO AND THEN AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY. ALRIGHT. CHAU. MAYBE NINETEEN EIGHTY STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB NINETEEN EIGHTY EXTENDS THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS FOR COMMENCING CIVIL ENFORCEMENT. FOR ABOVE GROUND PETROLEUM STORAGE ACTOR A P. S. A.. VIOLATIONS FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS. SPILLS FROM PETROLEUM TANKS COURSE CAN LEAD TO A HOST OF PROBLEMS FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL AND DRINKING WATER. TO INCREASE FIRE RISK. A PSA WAS ENACTED NINETEEN NINETY AS DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE SPELL OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF. PETROLEUM FROM AN ABOVE GROUND PETROLEUM TANKS. IN. INTO SENSITIVE MARSHES AND THE BAY DELTA ESTUARY. ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CURRENT LIMIT. SO WE WANT TO INCREASE THIS TO FIVE AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT USUALLY TAKES AT LEAST A YEAR AND SOMETIMES MORE. EMPLEADOS TO GAY ASIANS INVOLVING OF VIOLATIONS OF A PSA. THESE YOU'RE COMPLEX INVESTIGATIONS THAT OFTEN INVOLVE VIOLATIONS OF MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. AND WE REALLY WANT TO GET THESE THINGS RIGHT. A PSA IS ENFORCED BY THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCIES ALSO CALLED COOPER'S. OUR THE COOPERS UNIFY VIETMINH ASTRAY XIN PERMIT AND ENFORCEMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL LOSS. OF THE LAWS THAT COOPER IS IN FORCE EIGHT PSAS HE ONLY WON WITH ONE YEAR STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. SO YOU HAVE AN UNDERGROUND TANK. OR ANY OTHER SITUATION YOU HAVE A FIVE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. I HAVE KEVIN WONG HERE FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND JUSTICE MILAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA NOT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FIRE MENTAL. HEALTH ADMINISTERS HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. LET'S SEE LET'S START WITH MR Y.. THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS KEVIN LONG AND THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. APPEARING. ON BEHALF OF NANCY O'MALLEY. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FOR CIVIL ACTIONS BROUGHT UNDER THE ABOVE GROUND PETROLEUM STORAGE ACTFROM ONE YEAR. TO FIVE YEARS. BY DOING SO BY EXTENDING THE STATURE LIMITATIONS. IT'LL MAKE BEST OF OUR MENTAL LAW CONSISTENT WITH OTHER AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. AND ALSO REFLECT THE REALITIES OF THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE IMPORTANCE OF NAPSTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF NAPSTER. DESERTED IN AT STATED. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. JESS IS IMPORTANT AS THE OTHER AREAS. OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW LIKE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS HAZARDOUS WASTE LAW. HAS MATERIALIZE. AND ALL OF THOSE AREAS OF LAW. GET THE FIVE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. IN ORDER TO BRING CONSISTENCY. I'D THE ABOVE GROUND PATROLLING STORAGE ACT SHOULD ALSO HAVE THAT FIVE YEAR STATUTE LIMITATIONS. NOW BEYOND CONSISTENCY. EXTENDING THE STATURE LIMITATIONS BUT ALSO REFLECT THE REALITIES OF THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS AND HOW THEY COME TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES. THE ONLY WAY THESE CASES COME TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES. IS WHEN THEY REFERRED BY LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS THE COOPERS. THE COOP IS DO THEIR INSPECTIONS THEY OBSERVE VIOLATIONS. AND NAY USE THAT TAKE THE TIME TO USE THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. STEPS. TO BRING IT FACILITY BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. IT'S ONLY AFTER THEY TAKE THAT TIME TO EXHAUST ALL OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STEPS. IF THEY REFER THEM TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. SO WHAT IT COMES OVER TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. IT'S ALREADY DELAYED. AS FAR AS SCHEDULED. THEM WHEN WE GET THE CASE OUR OFFICES AT THE INVESTIGATE. FURTHER WE LOOK INTO OTHER AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW THAT ONLY ABSOLUTE ELATION BUT. UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK VIOLATIONS. HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LAW VIOLATIONS. HAS ITS MATERIAL VIOLATIONS BECAUSE WE WANNA. HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THESE CASES. AND ONE YEARS IS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DO THESE TYPES OF CASES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE'D ASK THAT. STAND THE SATCHEL LIMITATIONS THE FIVE YEARS AND WE WATCHED IT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS JUST ALONG THE HOPE FOR THE COOPER IS. I WANT TO YOU MUCH TIME TO RANDY WHO IS. A COOP IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY BUT WE JUST WANT TO ECHO THE A FORMA COMMENTS. BASICALLY IT AS WELL AS MENTIONED BEFORE THERE'S THERE'S ACTUALLY SIX DIFFERENT PROGRAMS UNDER THE CERTIFY UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENTS HERE IN A COOPER IS NAY ALL. HAVE BAD STATURE LIMITATIONS THERE FIVE YEARS THIS TO BE CONSISTENT. BUT DUE TO DO ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES WE ALSO WORK WHETHER AGENCIES TO LOOK AND AND HELP US INVESTIGATE. AND JUST IT TAKES TIME AND. WITH RESOURCES AND GETTING EVERYTHING SET UP IT COULD TAKE IT TAKES IN NUMBER MONTHS IF NOT A YEAR TO. DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. YOU DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A SAY NO WITNESSES DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CENA WITNESSES SO OPEN UP THE QUESTIONS THAT REMEMBERS. THIS HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FOR THE CHAIR AND WITH THAT SAID MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE COLD ROLLED. AB NINETEEN EIGHTY QUIRK. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE CHEN. CHEN I. ARAMBULA. WROTE. WROTE NOT VOTING. FRIEDMAN. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I. MATTEUCCI MERETZ WHICH YOU. FOR. THANK YOU. UP NEXT I'LL DEAL WITH. AB TWENTY SEVENTY TWO CONTAMINATES OF EMERGING CONCERN UP JOB MISTER VICE CHAIR. MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVENTY TWO WILL CREATED DEDICATED PROGRAM AT THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO RESEARCH MONITOR AND UNDERSTAND CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN OR. SOMETIMES CALLED C. E. SEES. AND OUR WATER SOURCES AND THEIR IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE INTENT IS TO HAVE DECISIONS MADE ABOUT REGULATING WATER QUALITY ON ROBUST SCIENCE. NOT MAJORITY VOTES TO THE LEGISLATURE. AGAIN EVEN I AS A SCIENTIST DON'T WISH TO BE AN AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA WE REALLY WANT THE SCIENCE DONE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE DEDICATED TO IT. AND HAVE THE TIME. NOW THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS IN COMMERCE TODAY THE CONSUMERS USE IN AND AROUND THEIR HOMES. THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE CHEMICALS ENTERING OUR WATER HAVE NUMERIC WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN. REGULATE FOR WHICH OUR PUBLIC US WATER SYSTEMS SHOULD MONITOR. CONSTITUENTS EMERGING CONCERN REPRESENTS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM FOR REGULATORS TO ADDRESS. OWING TO LIMITED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR SOURCES FATES IN THE FAX. AB TWENTY SEVENTY TWO WILL REQUIRE THE STATE WATER BOARD THE EXTENT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. TO MAKE RESEARCH ON. CONSTITUENTS STATUETTES PERMIT AT. WHICH WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON POTENTIAL WATER CONTAMINANTS AND UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE. SOME POLISH QUESTIONS IT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION ABOUT THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE CONSTITUENTS MIGHT INCLUDE. OF THE NEXT STEP AFTER. IDENTIFICATION IN. IS. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE M. PACKED ON M. ON FUTURE REGULATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH THE EXISTING. SCIENCE ADVISORY. PANELS. BROUGHT MY STAFF AND ARE WILLING AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH STATE HOLES ON CLARIFYING THESE POLICY QUESTIONS. WITH ME TODAY IS. ADRIA VENTURA FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION AND BOB. BOCOCK WITH THE AARON. BROCKOVICH FOUNDATION. OF WHICH WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. AT AT ALL RIGHT ANDREA PLEASE GO AHEAD AYE ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION. AND I SPEND A LOT OF MY CAREER WORKING ON DRINKING WATER STANDARDS AS WELL AS. CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN. AND I'LL JUST MAKE TWO POINTS ARE VERY QUICKLY WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO AND THE REALITY IS THESE CHEMICALS ARE OUT THERE. WE NEED TO GET A GRASP ON THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT A CALIFORNIA'S DRINKING WATER. UP THAT SAID I ALSO WOULD. OF MAKE MENTION THAT THE MORE DATA WE HAVE THE BETTER AND EVEN MORE COST EFFECTIVE DECISIONS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DOWN THE ROAD IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. THAT MEANS MAY BE POLLUTION PREVENTION BY UNDERSTANDING THE SOURCES THAT MEANS REALLY HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTAND WHAT TREATMENT REALLY IS NECESSARY. ARM AND SO WE DON'T OVER DO IT BUT WE ARE PROTECTIVE. I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS ONE OTHER ISSUE I HAVE HEARD IN THE BUILDING THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT PUSHED BACK BECAUSE THE RECYCLED WATER PROGRAM. HAS. SOME INTEREST IN ALREADY LOOKING AT ATTACHMENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECYCLED WATER FOR POTABLE REVIEWS. WE ARE LOOKING AT WASTE WATER THAT IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION IN OUR WATER. A STORM WATER PRODUCTS ENDING UP IN OUR WATER AND LEACHING CHEMICALS ARE ALSO PROBLEMS AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS THE CONSTITUENTS. AND THE CONCENTRATIONS MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE OF THIS MOVES US TOWARD ADDRESSING THAT DATA GAP AND THAT'S WHY CLEAN WATER ACTION AND OUR MEMBERS SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. KAREN A. NO BOB CHAIRMAN BOCA OF YEAH AARON. BROCKOVICH FOUNDATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BOB OKAKURA BROCKOVICH FOUNDATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION. UNIT DRINKING WATER AND AND. CLEAN WATER. DISCHARGE STANDARDS IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA GOAT DECADES. WITHOUT REGULATION. EVERYONE'S FAMILIAR WITH THE THE QUOTE ERIN BROCKOVICH CHEMICAL HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM WE PASSED FOUR PIECES OF LEGISLATION. IN THIS VERY ROOM ADDRESSING THAT THAT VERY CHEMICAL AND YET WE STILL DON'T HAVE A MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST CALIFORNIA LAW. WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS NOT ONLY FOR THE CHEMICALS THAT. ARE COMMERCE PUTS INTO REGULATION BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE CHEMICALS BREAKDOWN IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OFTENTIMES THE DAUGHTER CHEMICALS ARE ACTUALLY MORE TOXIC THAN THE CHEMICALS THEMSELVES. ON IN OUR TREATMENT PLANT PROCESSES WHETHER IT'S WASTE WATER OR INNER SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS WE OXIDIZERS CHEMICALS EITHER USING OZONE UV CHLORINE CHLORINE DIOXIDE. AND THOSE PROCESSES THEMSELVES MAKE A MYRIAD OF OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE OFTENTIMES MORE TOXIC AND WE HAVE A TENDENCY NOT TO STUDY THOSE. WHEN TREATING THE WATER IN THE BALLPARK ABA UNIT ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN'S AREA. WE WERE WE WERE FACED WITH T. C. E. AND THEN IT'S BREAKDOWN CHEMICALS WE GOT TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WE WERE HIT WITH. UP AMMONIUM PER CHLORATE FIVE YEARS LATER WE WERE HIT WITH% NDMA. THESE CHEMICALS DON'T HAVE REGULATIONS TODAY THEY ARE CHEMICALS OF EMERGING CONCERN AND THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE THEY TAKE TIME FOR THE PUBLIC TO. ACTUALLY PUT TREATMENT BARRIERS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER WEST I'M THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF WATER REDUCE CALIFORNIA BOMB WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL WERE STILL REVIEWING IT. WE PLAN TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THIS AUTHOR AND WERE GENERALLY SUPPORT ABOUT THE APPROACH HE'S TAKING. CURRENTLY I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THROUGH THAT WATER BOARDS RECYCLED WATER POLICY FOR RECYCLED WATER THEY MUST REVIEW CFCS. AND DO OUR MONITORING REVIEW THE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS FOR RECYCLED WATER EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THEN FACT THAT REVIEW HAS JUST HAPPEN IN FACT LAST MONTH AN EXPERT PANEL DID PUT OUT A REPORT. A ON CALLED MONITORING STRATEGIES FOR CONSTITUENTS OF EMERGING CONCERN FOR RECYCLED WATER. AMONG THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE REPORT. OUTLINED UPDATING A RISK BASED FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING CECE'S FOR HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS. WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF UPDATING THE FRAMEWORK AND AND WITH THE GENERAL APPROACH OF THAT EXPERT PANEL AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW IT ON HOW IT ALIGNS WITH THAT PROCESSES THAT ARE GOING ON AT THE WATER BOARD. AND ON GENERALLY SUPPORT ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR JUST MULLIN BEHOF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTIVES WE HAVE A MULTITUDE OF RESPONSIBILITIES RANGING TWO WATER WASTE WATER DRINKING WATER TETRA. SO WE DO LIKE THIS MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH WE DON'T JUST HAVE THAT RECYCLED WATER FOCUS. EMERGING A CHEMICALS EMERGING CONCERNED AFFECT EVERY ASPECT OF WATER SO WE DO LIKE THIS APPROACH ENERGI VOTE. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JUST GO GAGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCY IS. A WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS AND BILL TO TAKE A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESES AND WATER SOURCES SO FOR THAT REASON WE TOOK A SUPPORTING CONCEPT POSITION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND STAFF AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. BILL ELLIOTT ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP WE SUPPORT THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH THANK YOU. IF ENACTED ON BEHALF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. A MARINE ON THE OFFICE YOUR CLIP CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL OPENED UP TO. PLEASE MOMENTOUS. I'M SORRY ONCE AGAIN. NEITHER OPPOSED HER. SUPPORT BUT. TOM JACOB ON BEHALF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. INITIALLY HAD SOME. SOME SIGNIFICANT MISGIVINGS ABOUT. THIS. SAT DOWN WITH STAFF LAST WEEK LATE LAST WEEK TO DISCUSS THE AMENDED VERSION. M.. SATISFIED THAT THIS IS INDEED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND APPRECIATE THE. THE CHAIRS INITIAL COMMENTS IN HIS INITIAL STATEMENT. A ABOUT HIS INTENT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME ADDITIONAL. MODIFICATIONS TO THE BILL. NON AND WILL BE RECOMMENDING THAT OUR FOLKS A CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DEUS THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIR WAS LIKE CLOSE. AS I WILL CERTAINLY BE WORKING AS A SAID WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS LE CHEMISTRY COUNCIL. A SEWER AGENCIES ARE AS WELL AS RECYCLED WATER. I. AGAIN THE INTENT HERE IS LET'S DECIDE BY SCIENCE. ARE WERE ENVISIONING AS WE TALK TO THE WATER BOARD SOMETHING LIKE TWO TO THREE PEOPLE. WHO ARE DEDICATED TO THIS AND PERHAPS THEY CAN EVEN COME UP WITH THE STANDARD FOR CHROME SIX? I REALLY HOPED. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B.. TWO ZERO SEVEN TWO QUIRK. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. QUIRK. I QUIRK I. CHEN. CHEN I. I DON'T BELONG. BROKE. BRO BY. FRIEDMAN. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I. WHAT AT SEARCHING MERETZ RICHIE I? FIVE. OKAY. MY LAST BILL. A. B. TWENTY SIX SIXTY. ARE DEALING WITH RETAIL WASTE. SO. THANK. NOW WE HAVE A VERY GOOD CREW HERE. SO FIRST OF ALL. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ODDS NICE TO NICE TO BE HERE TODAY AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY ALLOWS A RETAILER. WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE A WEST WASTE DETERMINATION TO SHIP A SURPLUS HOUSEHOLD. ZOOMER PRODUCT TO REVERSE DISTRIBUTOR. WHAT WE'RE FINDING NOW IS WHEN THESE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE AT THE RETAIL LEVEL? THAT THERE IS A THE EXPERTISE THERE. AND THERE IS THE EXPERTISE AT THE REVERSE DISTRIBUTOR A REVERSE DISTRIBUTOR FOR THOSE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TERM BEFORE. IS SOMEBODY WHO TAKES IN THE MATERIALS FROM THE RETAILER. AND THEN DETERMINES CAN THEY BE REUSED CAN THEY BE GIVEN AWAY OR ARE THEY SOME SORT OF WASTE AND HOW WHAT KIND OF WASTE. HAZARDOUS OR. CAN IT GOING TO LANDFILLS AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE DECISION THAT IN THE RETAIL AND THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE FOR AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE BILL. BR I'M. SHOW DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS TO WHEN A PRODUCT BECOMES A WASTE. OF RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS HAVE DECIDED TO AVOID THE RISK OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION. BY ESTABLISHING VERY CONSERVATIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO THEY WILL OFTEN THROW THINGS OUT OR DECLARE THEM HAVE REDUCE WASTE WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY EITHER REUSABLE OR THEY'RE NOT HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE RESULT IS THAT PRODUCTS COULD OTHER BUYS THE DONATOR SALVAGED OR NOT. SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM WHEN THAT IS FAKE VEXED STOCKHOLDERS. SHE'S BEEN STAKEHOLDERS FOR YEARS. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE. OFFICIAL OPPOSITION I DO WATCH RECOGNIZE WE'RE WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF STAKE HOLDERS TAKING THEIR INPUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS A BETTER AND SAFER PROCESS. OUR THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF MANY STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TOGETHER AND COMING UP WITH THIS HOT NEW PROCEDURE. WHICH I GENUINELY THINK WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA. A. HOW CAN I SAY MORE CONSERVATIVE PLACE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT IT USES ITS MATERIALS? NOT DESIGNATING THINGS IS HAZARDOUS WHICH ARE NOT. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OH YES WITNESSES. I DON'T HAVE A LIST JUST INTRODUCE YOURSELVES. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME IS SHERRY RUDOLPH I'M CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER OF A NATIONAL NONPROFIT CALLED GET THREE SIXTY. GOOD THREE SIXTY IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN PRODUCT PHILANTHROPY AND PURPOSEFUL GIVING AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE WORK WITH CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT TO DONATE. AND WE MATCH UP THOSE DONATIONS WITH NONPROFITS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO NEED THESE I'D NEED THOSE ITEMS IN ORDER TO DELIVER ON THEIR OWN LOCAL MISSIONS AND MANDATES WE'VE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS. WE'VE DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND CRITICALLY NEEDED GOODS TO PEOPLE IN NEED INCLUDING CHILDREN FAMILIES THE HOMELESS VETERANS SURVIVORS OF DISASTER AND MANY MORE. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THREE THOUSAND NONPROFITS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF GET THREE SIXTY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING MORE THAN THIRTY THREE HUNDRED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE FOUND THAT THERE'S A REALLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN A STRONG DONATION ECOSYSTEM. SO WE HELP CORPORATIONS RESOLVE THE BUSINESS CHALLENGE OF RESPONSIBLY DONATING ACCESS GOODS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT WE ALSO HELP NONPROFITS ACCESS GOODS THAT HELP THEM DELIVER ON THEIR MISSIONS. THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO OTHERWISE DONATIONS ALLOW NON PROPOSITION WRETCH THEIR BUDGETS EVEN FURTHER ALLOWING THEM TO FOCUS MORE ON THEIR SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AS OPPOSED TO THE PURCHASE OF GOODS. THROUGH THESE NONPROFITS INDIVIDUALS FACING CHALLENGING LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES GET THE GOODS THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE DAY TO DAY. AND GOODS ARE GIVEN A NEW LIFE NOT ONLY REDUCING WASTE BUT KEEPING THEM OUT OF LANDFILLS AND ALSO ALLOWING US TO COLLECTIVELY BUILD MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO DISTRIBUTE MORE NEEDED PRODUCT WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE DEMANDS BUT WE CAN'T FULFILL THAT DEMAND BECAUSE OF CURRENT RESTRICTIONS. MANY OF OUR CORPORATE PARTNERS WILL NOT ALLOW THEIR DONATED PRODUCTS TO BE DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY BECAUSE THE CURRENT SCRUTINY AROUND HAZARDOUS WASTE POSES TO HIGHER RISK. THREATS TO THE MOVEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF DONATIONS CAN THREATEN AND DISRUPT THE MOVEMENT OF ALL DONATIONS SINCE RETAILERS CANNOT RUN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS EACH CATERING TO A SPECIFIC TYPE OR CATEGORY OF CONSUMER PRODUCT. OUR NONPROFIT MEMBERS CONSTANTLY ASK FOR ITEMS LIKE PERSONAL CARE GOODS SHAMPOO COSMETICS AND CLEANING SUPPLIES. BECAUSE THESE ARE HIGH NEED GOODS AND THEY ALWAYS NEED TO BE REPLENISHED THE THAT THESE ITEMS HAVE VALUE IN THESE NONPROFITS ARE OFTEN WILLING TO PAY FOR SHIPPING. OR EVEN PICK UP THOSE ITEMS THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE ITEMS ARE IN SUCH HIGH NEED. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE IT'S THREE SIXTEEN SURE THAT DONATIONS ARE HANDLED RESPONSIBLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. ARE MEMBERS ARE NONPROFIT MEMBERS GO THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE VETTING PROCESS WITH US TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY VERIFIED FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATION. BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT DONATED PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED AND USED APPROPRIATELY AND AS INTENDED. WELL WE'D LIKE TO SEE SAM TECHNICAL LANGUAGE CHANGES WITHIN THE BILL CURRENTLY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN WE DO SUPPORT THE OVERALL GOAL AND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO BRING MORE CRITICALLY NEEDED GOODS. HERE TO CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE NICOLE CAN UNITS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS MANUFACTURE A VARIETY OF CONSUMER GOODS AND THEY'RE SOLD OUT OF RIGHT YOU RETAILERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I THE FAMILY MEMBER QUIRK STATE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT. ENVIRONMENT WE'RE FINDING THAT RETAILERS ARE VERY CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING OUR UNSOLD PRODUCTS WHICH IS LEADING TO UNNECESSARY WASTE. AS A RESULT THROUGH THIS BILL WE ARE HOPING. TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE SENATE UNNECESSARILY TO HAZARDOUS WASTE I IN MOST INSTANCES WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE STILL VALUE IN THESE PRODUCTS AND TO DISPOSE OF. THESE ITEMS WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE FOR LIQUIDATION DONATION RECYCLING SUCH A. IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR MANUFACTURERS EXPENSIVE FOR RETAILERS BUT YOU MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT CLEAR FOR RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS WHEN THE REVERSE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. IT CAN BE USED AND WILL ALLOW FOR CONSOLIDATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS PRODUCTS TO OPEN UP MORE MARKETPLACES. I'M AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO FINE TUNE THE LANGUAGE I'M AND WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT SAYS THE. BASS SOLUTION THAT CAME OUT OF THE RETAIL HAZARDOUS WASTE WORK GROUP THAT WE ALL PARTICIPATED AND FOR. A YEAR ALL OVER ALTERING AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN I'M AND WE DID DEVELOP A REPORT THAT WAS. DELIVER TO THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND THIS IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ONE OF THE OPTIONS IN THE REPORT WE BELIEVE I'M ITS WENT BUST OPTIONS THANK YOU. DURING. MISTER CHAIR JUST MALONE FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTORS WE ACTUALLY HAVE ALL THREE PROGRAMS WE HAVE THE COOPER PROGRAM WE HAVE THE MEDICAL WASTE PROGRAM AND THE SOLID WASTE PROGRAM. AND YES INDEED IT HAS BEEN A VEXING PROBLEM NOT ONLY DO WE SOMETIMES OVER CHARACTERIZE THE WAYS WE DO SOMETIMES UNDER CHARACTER. SO WE DO BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP. DO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THAT WASTE MORE ACCURATELY BETTER IN THESE CONSOLIDATED AREAS THAT RELY ON THESE THOUSANDS OF RETAIL STORES TO DO THAT WASTE CHARACTERIZATION STATES ONE STEP IN AN IMPORTANT PROGRESS. AND DEATH THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE POOL INTRODUCING THE BILL. OF THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAWN KEPT KEY MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR JIM WOOD OF THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WERE NOT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. A BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ONE ASPECT IN THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ADD. A NEW EXEMPTION TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE. LANGUAGE THAT DOES PROTECT TO LET. INFORMATION FROM. DISCLOSURE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS AS NARROW AS POSSIBLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THE COMMITTEE IN THE STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD THAT END THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT ITSELF BEYOND IT WE DO SUPPORT GROCERY MANUFACTURERS THANKS. CATHERINE OF ARAGON ON BEHALF OF RALPH'S IN SUPPORT. AMARILLO MAP OF THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. TRANSMETA BEHALF OF RITE AID AND SUPPORT. ANDREA ENTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION. AYE YOU OUGHT TO IS PART OF THE RETAIL WASTE. WORKGROUP AND WHILE WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION AT THIS POINT TO OFFER SUPPORT WE THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT GOOD ABOUT THIS BILL. UP WE THINK THE CONCEPT IS GOOD WE HAVE A FEW SPECIFIC ISSUES AROUND. ARE OVER THE COUNTER PHARMACEUTICALS THAT IF THEY ARE NOT DEEMED TO BE USABLE OR ABLE TO BE. SENT TO SOMEPLACE THAT NEEDS THEM THAT THEY MAY END UP IN NOT IS HAZARDOUS WASTE BUT JUST THROWN IN THE TRASH AND END UP AN ARMBAR MAY. THAT SAID WE ARE WORKING WITH STAFF WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE IF PROPONENTS OF THE BILL TO TRY TO WORK OUT SOME OF THESE DETAILS SO WE'RE HOPING TO COME TO A SUPPORT. POSITION ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT. GLAD TO BE WORKING WITH FOLKS. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. NOW WITH THAT ON MEMBERS OF ANY QUESTIONS. SECURE WAS LIKE CLOSE. YES JUST THAT I'LL BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS HAVE WE HEARD SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE HEARD QUESTIONS ABOUT DISCLOSURE. AND ABOUT THE. SPUR SMITH OF.
