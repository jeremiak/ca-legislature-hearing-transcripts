REALLY CHALLENGING ON SENATOR

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.823
WITH THE BILL IS.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.559
AGAIN -- IT TO THE EXTENT

THERE'S A LOCAL REVENUE IMPACT --

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.497
AGE I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.732
THAT THE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.401
THAT WAS RECEIVING THE

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.169
INVESTMENT THE JOBS ANOTHER DOG

00:13:57.236 --> 00:14:01.273
DIRECT BENEFITS TO THE EXTENT

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.009
THERE WAS A CLOSER NEXUS.

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:06.312
AND THE BENEFIT OF THE AND I

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.980
THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE WORKABLE

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:11.417
IT'S PRETTY HARD -- THE WAY THE

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.752
PROGRAM WORKS IS A MANUFACTURER

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.021
WILL HAVE A LIST OF THINGS.

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:18.591
THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:19.959
FOR FOR FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.228
PROJECT AND THE AND IT'S UP TO

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.729
THE MANUFACTURER IN TERMS OF

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.232
WHERE THEY BY THOSE PRODUCTS SO.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.767
THE THE THE TAX THE IMPACT OF

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.903
THE TAX REDUCTION IS COULD BE

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.373
SPREAD ALL VER THE PLACE WHERE

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.675
THE IF YOU LOOK IN THIS IN THIS

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:37.910
ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT TESLA

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.078
GETTING A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.846
DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF THE

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:41.580
PROGRAM.

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:42.982
WILL CLEARLY SAID THE CITY OF

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.883
FREMONT IS BENEFITING A LOT FROM

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.485
THOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:49.121

CONTRIBUTIONS COMING FROM.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.660
IT'S VERY HARD IN THIS PROGRAM

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.928
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.463
RESTRUCTURING SO THERE'S A

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.531
CLOSER NEXUS BETWEEN -- THE

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:03.802
CONTRIBUTORS AND AND THE BENEFIT.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.804

EITHER SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.755
FIX THE SYSTEM.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.057

WOULD SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:27.519
DIFFERENT.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:28.821
IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.089
POTENTIALLY A ONE TIME LOSS THAT

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.123
IS NOTED.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.424

UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND IF

THIS IS A PROBLEM MEMBERS

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.778
STATEWIDE SHOULD THIS NOT BE

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:28.313
FUNDED OUT OF THE STATE GENERAL

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:30.315
FUND BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:31.482
STATEWIDE CONCERN.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:32.917
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE FOISTING

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.585
ADDITIONAL FEES ON CONSUMERS

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:35.687
THAT MIGHTNOT HAVE BATTERY

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.889
PLANTS IN THEIR GIVEN GEOGRAPHIC

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.491
AREAS SO REALLY FOR US IT'S A

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:41.359
QUESTION NOT SO MUCH OF THE FEE

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:52.470
INCREASES JUST EQUITY IN GENERAL.

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:55.239
FOR THOSE REASONS ASK FOR NOVA.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.374

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:02.013
LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION.

BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:04.749
SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.250
COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION A

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.453
MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY CENTER

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.521
TITLE IS VICE CHAIR [inaudible]

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:13.458
FOR MR -- IT ALWAYS SEEMS THAT --

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:15.259
WHEN WE GET A YEAR TAX INCREASE

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:16.961
IT TO IT'S A BIG ONE IT'S IS

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:17.562
UNDER PERCENT ALTHOUGH JUST A

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:18.863
DOLLAR?

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.797
AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING --

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.665
USING THE ARGUMENT IS WELL WE

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.934
HAVEN'T RAISED IT IN A LONG TIME

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.568
THEREFORE WE GOT A REALLY CATCH

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:24.235
UP.

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:25.403
IS THERE A WAY TO MAYBE MODIFY

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.938
THE BILL TO DO IT INCREMENTALLY

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.506
OVER TIME.

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.441
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE ALLOW

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.743
THE FEE TO BE AT THE RATE AT

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.711
WHICH IS COMING IN.

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.013
WE WOULD HAVE -- OVER THIRTY

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.281
YEARS BEFORE WE COULD FINISH THE

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.850
CLEANUP AND SO WE CONTINUE TO

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:41.352
PUT PEOPLE ARE ASSN THE HEALTH

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.186

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:45.189
CHILDREN OUT THERE BEING BORN

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:47.558
PRETTY DETRIMENTAL WE AND WE'RE

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:48.659
ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:52.797
CONSUMER FEE IS EQUITABLE UNABLE

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:55.166
TO THE MANUFACTURE FEE.

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.033
I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS AREN'T

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.634
ALWAYS A DEAL IN IN THE

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.669
LEGISLATURE -- BUT THERE IS A

00:33:58.736 --> 00:33:59.737
SENSE OF URGENCY ACROSS THE

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:00.872
STATE NOW THAT WE KNOW THE

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:03.141
EFFECTS OF LED OUT THERE AND AND

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.076
A SENSE TO HURRY UP AND TAKE

ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.331

LET IS ONE OF THE MANY TOXIC

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.126
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ON A

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.061

WAS JUST AMENDED LAST WEEK OF

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.835
COURSE SO -- THAT WAS THE REASON

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.803
FOR THAT -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:07.938
THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.339
DIFFERENT REASONS MEMBERS LESSEN

DECADES THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.549
PREVIOUSLY TO TRY AN INCREASE

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:22.586

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:29.893
NOT.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.527
SORT OF AN IMPETUS TO PUSH HESE

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:31.995
LOCAL TAXES UP 23% SO WE

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.096

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:41.371
REASON -- THERE'S COMPLIANCE

AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHERS WHAT

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.714
THAT LEADS TO ITS CONSUMERS JUST

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.249
JUMPING AROUND FROM MUNICIPALITY

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:54.151

DUE TO A LACK OF ACCESS TO CLEAN

MANY OF THEM WEREN'T BOILING IT

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.731

EXPERIENCES WITH BACTERIAL

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.301

WAS A WAY TO TREAT THAT WATER --

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.004
BUT BECAUSE THIS WATER WAS

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.272
CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD THAT CAN

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:38.607
ACTUALLY CONCENTRATE THAT

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:40.675
CONTAMINANT AND SUBJECT FAMILIES

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:26.852
LAY OUT WHY THIS HAS BEEN

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:27.686
DIFFICULT.

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:28.887
SO INITIALLY WE PROPOSE THERE TO

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:35.093
BE A REGIONAL AGENCY AND WHAT WE

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.995
HAD HEARD BOTH IT'S FROM A BAG

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:37.896
AN MTC WAS THERE ARE TWO

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:38.564
REGIONAL AGENCIES ALREADY WHY DO

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:38.964
WE NEED A THIRD.

02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:39.798
AND SO IT IS CONTEMPLATED RATHER

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:40.666
THAN CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW

02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:42.134
REGIONAL AGENCY THAT WE HAVE

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.969
PASSED ANTI SEEN A BACK TO WORK

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:46.271
TOGETHER. TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:10:46.338 --> 02:10:49.208
COLLECTIVELY THOSE TWO BODIES

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:51.276
CAN TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:52.144
THAT WE NEED TO MOVE THIS

02:10:52.211 --> 02:10:52.878
FORWARD.

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:55.214
SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.316
OF HOW WE'RE DOING THIS BUT I

02:10:57.382 --> 02:10:58.684
SHOULD ALSO SAY AS YOU KNOW.

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:01.286
M. T. C. IS VIEWED AS A BODY

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:03.322
IT'S A REGIONAL BODY -- BUT

02:11:03.388 --> 02:11:05.090
BECAUSE THERE APPEARS TO BE A

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:06.658
HEAVY AWAY FROM FROM LARGER

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:08.527
CITIES THAT HAS CREATED A RACKED

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:10.195
REACTION FROM SOME OF THE

02:11:10.262 --> 02:11:12.030
SMALLER AND SUBURBAN CITIES.

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.465
LIKE WISE BECAUSE THE MTC AND

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.100
HOW IT'S STRUCTURED TYPICALLY

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:17.002
HAVING ONE VOTE PER CITY IT IS

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.103
VIEWED AS BEING MORE

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:19.605
REPRESENTATIVE FOR SMALLER AND

02:11:19.671 --> 02:11:20.939
SUBURBAN CITIES AND SO WHAT

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:22.474
WE'VE TRIED TO DO WITH THIS BILL.

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:24.343
IS TO REALLY ASK BOTH BODIES TO

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:25.911
WORK TOGETHER.

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:28.580
IN MOVING THIS FORWARD AND AS

02:11:28.647 --> 02:11:30.082
YOU KNOW BOTH ANTI SEEN A BAG

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:31.683
ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION AS WE

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:33.252
SPEAK ABOUT HOW TO DO BETTER

02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:34.586
WORK TOGETHER SO THAT IS REALLY.

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:36.188
THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:37.990
TO DO HAVING ONE BODY OR THE

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.825
OTHER DICTATE FUNDING WOULD BE

02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.393
LIKE SUGGESTING THAT IN THIS

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:44.062
CASE THE SENATE THE U. S. SENATE.

02:11:44.129 --> 02:11:45.197
OUGHT TO DECIDE FUNDING FOR

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:47.532
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT HAS ONE OR

02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:48.734
TWO VOTES PER STATE.

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.469
THAT THAT HAS CREATED A LITTLE

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.970
BIT OF REACTION FROM FROM SOME

02:11:52.037 --> 02:11:53.705
CITIES THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:54.906
JUST HAVING HOUSE DICTATE THAT

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:57.542
WOULD MAKE SENSE SO AGAIN WE'VE

02:11:57.609 --> 02:11:58.310
SAID TO AIM TO SEEN A BACK CAN

02:11:58.377 --> 02:11:59.511
CAN THE TWO AGENCIES WORK

02:11:59.578 --> 02:12:00.579
TOGETHER.

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.781
THAT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME BUT MY

02:12:02.848 --> 02:12:05.684
HOPE IS AND I'M A VERY -- AGAIN

02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:07.119
NOT JUST APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK

02:12:07.185 --> 02:12:08.186
OF YOU ANOTHER -- LOCAL

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:09.321
LEGISLATORS BUT THE FEEDBACK

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:12.391
FROM ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIVES

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:14.426
OF EIGHT AND A BAG AN MTC ON

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:15.627
THIS THIS WILL MAKE THE BILL

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:16.662
BETTER AND THAT IS OUR HOPE OVER

02:12:16.728 --> 02:12:18.263
THE NEXT MONTH THAT WE

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:19.531
INCORPORATE THAT FEEDBACK SO

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.233
LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:21.433
THAT.

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:22.868
I DON'T KNOW MAY HAVE MAYORIF

02:12:22.934 --> 02:12:23.635

SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:38.483
INITIALLY WITH BILL SUPPOSE I

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:39.084
DIDN'T SUPPORT CREATING A NEW

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.152
BUREAUCRACY I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.454
APPROPRIATE THAT A BAG OR MTC.

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:43.422
TAKE ON THIS ROLE OF RUNNING

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:43.955
THIS NEW REGIONAL HOUSING

02:12:44.022 --> 02:12:44.856
FINANCE AGENCY THAT WAS THE OVER

02:12:44.923 --> 02:12:45.524
RIDING CONCERN THAT WE'VE HEARD.

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:46.258
FROM CITIES OF ALL SIZES THE BAY

AREA AND THE BILL AMENDMENTS

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:48.260
THAT WE WORKED OUT.

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:49.795
THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED WOULD HAVE

02:12:49.861 --> 02:12:51.496
A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH

02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:54.299
A BAG NMTC TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:56.001
THE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:58.003
ON THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION FOR

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:00.505
PROJECTS THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:02.407
WE DO AROUND OUR SUSTAINABLE

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:04.309
COMMUNITY STRATEGY PLAN BAY AREA

02:13:04.376 --> 02:13:05.477
WE'RE BOTH AGENCIES WORK

TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE REGIONAL

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.547
LAND USE PLAN.

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.115
SO I THINK THIS PRESIDENT WE YOU

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:11.183
KNOW WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:12.284
THERE'S GONNA BE A MUCH BROADER

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:15.087
CONVERSATION ON SHARED REGIONAL

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:16.021
GOVERNANCE IN THE COMING MONTHS

02:13:16.088 --> 02:13:17.189
AND YEARS.

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:18.323
THANK YOU SO MUCH AS MAYOR IF I

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:19.658
COULD TURN OVER CONVERSATION IN

THE WALL -- I KNOW THAT MS

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:22.227
SECOND WOULD LIKE ME TO SAY A

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:25.163
FEW WORDS PRIOR -- TO CLOSING --

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.998
IT WITH MR CHIU LET'S HAVE THE

02:13:27.065 --> 02:13:31.036
COMMITTEE DANCING COMMENTS

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:32.471
QUESTIONS CENTER ABOUT.

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:33.138
WELL AS A MEMBER OF THE

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:33.705
COMMITTEE FROM THE BAY AREA

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:34.840
LET'S BE VERY INVOLVED IN THE

02:13:34.906 --> 02:13:36.742
DISCUSSIONS SO -- GENERALLY --

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:39.378
OF FROM SAN JOSE'S PERSPECTIVE --

02:13:39.444 --> 02:13:41.713
WE SEE -- A LOT OF HOUSING

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.248
BUILDING SAN JOSE THIS

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.549
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:46.785
AND A LOT OF WORK DONE OVER THE

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:48.120
LAST SEVERAL DECADES.

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:49.388
BUT WE SEE OUR REMAINING

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:53.425
NEIGHBORS NOT PRODUCING -- I'LL

02:13:53.492 --> 02:13:54.326
JUST SAY.

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:56.027
THEIR FAIR SHARE.

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:59.798
OR OR OR ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.767
THE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:14:01.833 --> 02:14:05.537
SO IT'S KIND OF LONG STANDING --

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:06.638
PROBLEM.

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:08.173
AND I THINK THAT HAVING A

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:11.076
REGIONAL OF KIND OF APPROACH.

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:13.845
MIGHT BE ONE WAY OF SOLVING THAT

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:15.647
THAT ISSUE.

02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:19.184
MY MY PARTICULAR VIEW IS THAT --

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:21.319
OF THE CONDUCT OF THE

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:23.989
LEGISLATORS SHOULD BE.

02:14:24.055 --> 02:14:25.023
YEAH WE GOT TO DO IT THE HARD

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:26.391
WAY FOLKS.

02:14:26.458 --> 02:14:28.660
THE HARDWARE IS KIND OF LIKE HOW

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:30.529
WE DID REGIONAL MEASURE.

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:31.997
THREE WHICH WAS.

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:33.098
AS ALWAYS ALL THE BERRY

02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:35.100
LEGISLATORS KNOW VERY DIFFICULT

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:36.334
TO GET.

02:14:36.401 --> 02:14:38.403
THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE BAY AREA

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:41.540
LET LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION.

02:14:41.606 --> 02:14:44.643
ARE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY.

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:46.778
AROUND THE BAY THE NINE COUNTY --

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.547
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCIES

02:14:48.613 --> 02:14:49.948
AND ALL.

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:53.318
OF THE COUNTY -- AREAS INCLUDING

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:57.189
YOURS -- MADAM COUNCILMAN -- TO

02:14:57.255 --> 02:15:00.892
SUPPORT THE THE REGIONAL MEASURE

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:01.626
THREE THE GOT PLACED ON THE

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:02.627
BALLOT.

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.262
AS SUCCESSFULLY VOTED ON IN THE

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:05.864
BAY AREA WHEN WE PUT THAT ON THE

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:07.299
BALLOT.

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:09.067
IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND I

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.569
THINK IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AS

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:12.103
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS BECAUSE

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:12.971
YOU WORKED ON IT VERY HARD WITH

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:14.272
ME.

02:15:14.339 --> 02:15:15.407
AND SIR MCGUIRE AND CENTER

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:16.741
WINNER AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS

02:15:16.808 --> 02:15:18.844
VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE WORK

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:22.447
SO WE DID THAT PREP WORK THAT

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:24.182
WAS SO DIFFICULT.

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:27.385
THE TWO YET -- SOME PEOPLE SAID

02:15:27.452 --> 02:15:28.520
IS LIKE HERDING FERAL CATS YOU

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:29.621
KNOW WITH THE BAY AREA POLITICS

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:32.257
BUT BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT WE HAVE

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:33.758
TO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER.

02:15:33.825 --> 02:15:35.627
AND BRING OURSELVES TOGETHER BUT

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:37.462
I BUT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE

02:15:37.529 --> 02:15:38.763
STRONGLY.

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:41.766
THERE ARE A REGIONAL

02:15:41.833 --> 02:15:42.067
[inaudible]

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:45.237
HOUSING ORGANIZATION.

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:46.738
COULD BE AS SIMPLE ORGANIZATION

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:48.240
COULD BE AS SIMPLE ORGANIZATION

02:15:48.306 --> 02:15:50.942
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE FOCUSING ON

02:15:51.009 --> 02:15:52.744
JUST BUILDING A HOUSING.

02:15:52.811 --> 02:15:54.446
GETTING A HOUSING PROGRAMS GOING

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:56.081
JUST YOU KNOW KEEP KEEP IT

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:58.583
SIMPLE -- I TAKE -- WE CAN BE

02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:01.086
VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HAVING A AND

02:16:01.152 --> 02:16:04.256
A MEDIA TO IMPACT ON ON

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:05.624
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE BAY

02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:07.759
AREA WHICH WE SO DESPERATELY

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:08.426
NEED.

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.295
IT'S IT'S IT'S PROBABLY THE

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:12.030
MAJOR REASON WHY.

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:14.266
OUR ECONOMY COULD LAG IN THE BAY

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:15.267
AREA.

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:17.402
IS BECAUSE A LACK OF AFFORDABLE

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:19.538
HOUSING IT'S IT'S IT'S WE'RE AT

02:16:19.604 --> 02:16:21.239
WE'RE AT A POINT WERE OF PEOPLE

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:22.173
ARE GOING TO START LOSING THEIR

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.242
JOBS AND BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO

02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:25.310
START TO LEAVE.

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:29.214
AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:30.715
ISSUE FROM THE REGIONAL

02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:32.717
PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHY SUPPORT

02:16:32.784 --> 02:16:34.953
THIS BILL -- GOING FORWARD AND

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.821
HAVING TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION IS

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:39.324
GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT.

02:16:39.391 --> 02:16:45.196
THAT -- OF IT'S IT'S NOT ABOUT --

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:46.898
IT'S NOT ABOUT US IT'S ABOUT

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:48.066
THEM I KEEP TELLING MYSELF

02:16:48.133 --> 02:16:50.302
THAT'S ONE OF MY SAYINGS I GIVE

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.304
MY STAFF IS NOT ABOUT US.

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.439

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.957
TO ENGAGE WITH THAT.

02:23:19.023 --> 02:23:20.758
LET ME JUST CLOSE BY FOCUSING ON

02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:22.493
THE NEED THERE WAS A SUGGESTION

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.294
THAT SOMEHOW THE BAY AREA HAS

02:23:23.361 --> 02:23:24.495
NOT BEEN THE EPICENTER OF THE

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:25.596
HOUSING CRISIS.

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:27.231
THAT IS A STATEMENT THAT I HAVE

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:28.066
TO TAKE.

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.268

WE SAW AND WE EXPERIENCE THE

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.906
HOUSING CRISIS BEFORE OTHER

02:23:36.774 --> 02:23:38.776
YEARS AGO AND TO THIS DAY WE

02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:40.678
HAVE THE HIGHEST HOME PRICES WE

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:42.046
HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE LEVELS WE

02:23:42.113 --> 02:23:43.348
HAVE THE HIGHEST ADDICTION RATES.

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.316

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:46.951
HOMELESSNESS LEVELS ARE RIGHTLY.

02:23:47.018 --> 02:23:48.152

A PARKING FOR SECOND SO WHAT

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:02.439
WHAT WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT.

MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:33:18.756 --> 02:33:20.057
OPPOSITION IS THAT THEY WANT TO

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:21.158
ENSURE PARKING FOR THOSE

02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:22.459

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:17.854

MAJOR HIGHWAY CAPACITY.

02:43:58.728 --> 02:44:00.664
INCREASING PROJECTS THAT THE

NOW THAT THE IT'S THERE ARE.

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:16.246
THERE I'VE HEARD OF PLACES WHERE

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:17.514
THIS COULD BE A VERY GOOD IN

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:18.748
THIS IMPORTANT IN THE SET

02:44:18.815 --> 02:44:20.116
NECESSARY BILL.

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:21.751
THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE STATE

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:23.386
POLICY AREAS THAT WERE THIS

02:44:23.453 --> 02:44:25.155
WOULD OPEN UP THE GATES AND WE

02:44:25.222 --> 02:44:27.023
THINK THAT THAT IS INVOLVED SAY

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:28.692
WITH A A OR B. ISSUES IT WITH

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:34.731
THIS MASSIVE IN A DEVELOPMENT A

02:44:34.798 --> 02:44:36.499
ENABLING.

02:44:36.566 --> 02:44:37.634
THE ACTION HERE.

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:39.302
BUT ALSO IT IS HAPPEN SO SOON

02:44:39.369 --> 02:44:40.971
AFTER THE RECENT THE FAILURE TO

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:41.571
PASS THAT THEY SPEND A MILLION

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:42.739
DOLLARS TRYING TO DEFEAT IT IT

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:43.807
DIDN'T WORK.

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:45.408
SO WE'LL COME BACK TO THE THE

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:47.944
CHANGING THE RULES AT THIS POINT --

02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:49.646
WE THINK IT IS JUST IS NOT AN

02:44:49.713 --> 02:44:52.015
ADVISABLE SO IT IS NOT ADVISABLE

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:55.252

02:45:01.358 --> 02:45:02.792
WHICH WE THINK RAISES A NUMBER

02:45:02.859 --> 02:45:05.862
STATE POLICY QUESTIONS AND WHAT

02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:06.963

FOCUSES ON JUST TO COUNTIES IS

02:45:58.448 --> 02:45:59.683
THE WAY THE BILL READS IS CAN BE

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:02.285
FOCUS ON SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND

02:46:02.352 --> 02:46:03.386
PLASTER COUNTY.

IS THIS NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:13.396

CONTIGUOUS JURISDICTIONS.

02:46:15.899 --> 02:46:17.567
SO WE CAN -- WHAT WOULD BE VERY

02:46:17.634 --> 02:46:20.003
CHALLENGING IS IF WE'RE TAKING

02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:22.105
SPECIFIC SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN AN

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:23.540
UNINCORPORATED AREA?

02:46:23.606 --> 02:46:25.575

ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO PAYS WHAT

02:46:27.944 --> 02:46:29.045
LEVEL OF TAX WOULD BE A

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.113
CHALLENGE.

02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:34.751
THIS UP.

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:36.252
THERE WOULD BE EIGHT CONTIGUOUS

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:39.022
CITIES WITHIN.

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:40.390
THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO.

03:28:44.445 --> 03:28:45.779
IN THE LAW.

03:28:45.846 --> 03:28:46.780

03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:06.333
MAJOR GOVERNMENTAL TOOL TO

03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:07.101
COMBAT CORRUPTION.

03:29:07.167 --> 03:29:11.005
IT IS MAJOR BECAUSE OF THE POWER

PROTECT IN THIS CASE IF A KEY

03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:15.055
TâM.

03:37:15.122 --> 03:37:16.623
PLAINTIFF DOES COME FORWARD IN

03:37:16.690 --> 03:37:17.424
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE THAT

03:37:17.491 --> 03:37:19.493
UP THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ACCESS

03:37:19.559 --> 03:37:21.461
TO ANY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL TAX

03:37:21.528 --> 03:37:22.028
RECORDS WE'VE MADE THAT VERY

03:37:22.095 --> 03:37:22.996
CLEAR.

03:37:23.063 --> 03:37:24.865
OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO A CITY WHO IS

03:37:24.931 --> 03:37:26.533
PURSUING TAX FRAUD SHOULD

03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:28.802
ABSOLUTELY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

03:37:28.869 --> 03:37:30.237
RECORDS BUT THAT IS BEING HELD

03:37:30.303 --> 03:37:31.738
AND IN THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTACT

03:37:31.805 --> 03:37:32.472
AND THERE ARE.

03:37:32.539 --> 03:37:34.074
PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE DO NOT

03:37:34.141 --> 03:37:35.942
WANT THROUGH THIS MECHANISM THAT

03:37:36.009 --> 03:37:37.210
INFORMATION THAT CONFIDENTIAL

03:37:37.277 --> 03:37:40.514
INFORMATION OF EVEN OF A TAX.

03:37:40.580 --> 03:37:42.716
FRAUD VIOLATOR TO TO NECESSARILY

03:37:42.783 --> 03:37:44.885
BE PUBLIC THOSE THOSE RECORDS

03:37:44.951 --> 03:37:46.219
ARE.

03:37:46.286 --> 03:37:47.387
ARE TO BE PROTECTED.

03:37:47.454 --> 03:37:48.688
SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH

03:37:48.755 --> 03:37:49.923
SOME OF THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:52.259
WE ARE FRAMING THIS IN THE WAY

03:37:52.325 --> 03:37:53.627
THAT HE'S ABLE OF GIVING THE

03:37:53.693 --> 03:37:55.529
ATTORNEY GENERAL THE ABILITY TO

03:37:55.595 --> 03:37:57.130
GO AFTER TAX FRAUD.

03:37:57.197 --> 03:37:59.733
CLOSE THAT TAX GAP HAPPY TO TALK

03:37:59.800 --> 03:38:01.668
ABOUT THE LIMITS THAT THAT YOU

03:38:01.735 --> 03:38:03.103
AND I IT TOOK DISCUSSED EARLIER.

03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:04.738
AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY

03:38:04.805 --> 03:38:06.139
MAKE SENSE IN THIS CONTEXT

03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:08.141
ALTHOUGH FUNDAMENTALLY IF

03:38:08.208 --> 03:38:08.708
SOMEONE IS THE FRAUD IN THE

03:38:08.775 --> 03:38:09.843
STATE.

03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:10.844
AT THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:38:10.911 --> 03:38:11.778
DOLLAR LEVEL OF THE TWO MILLION

03:38:11.845 --> 03:38:13.346
DOLLAR LEVEL.

03:38:13.413 --> 03:38:15.449
AS TAXPAYERS WE SHOULD ALL.

03:38:15.515 --> 03:38:17.384
ACTUALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

03:38:17.451 --> 03:38:18.685
BUT GIVEN THE PENALTIES THE

03:38:18.752 --> 03:38:20.153
PENALTIES ARE IN INTENTIONALLY

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:22.189
STRICT ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:38:22.255 --> 03:38:23.457
THIS IS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY

03:38:23.523 --> 03:38:24.357
AND THAT THE TOOLS.

03:38:24.424 --> 03:38:26.359
CAN BE EFFECTIVE THAT'S WHAT

03:38:26.426 --> 03:38:27.427
WE'RE REALLY TIES I WOULD NEVER

03:38:27.494 --> 03:38:28.795
QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT NEW

03:38:28.862 --> 03:38:29.629
YORK STATE.

03:38:29.696 --> 03:38:30.597
THERE IS SOME PRELIMINARY

03:38:30.664 --> 03:38:32.399
INFORMATION ABOUT THE

03:38:32.466 --> 03:38:34.234
EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW YORK WE

03:38:34.301 --> 03:38:36.102
LOOKS LIKE THAT IS EFFECTIVE AND

03:38:36.169 --> 03:38:41.041
I THINK THE AG HAS THAT

03:38:41.107 --> 03:38:41.675
INFORMATION AND CAN ADDRESS THAT

03:38:41.741 --> 03:38:48.482
ISSUE. FOR SURE SIR WHY NEW YORK.

03:38:48.548 --> 03:38:49.583
IN TWENTY TEN NEW YORK ENACTED.

03:38:49.649 --> 03:38:52.652
A VERY SIMILAR A STATUTE UPON

03:38:52.719 --> 03:38:53.353
WHICH WERE BASING THIS AMENDMENT --

03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:54.020
THEY HAVE COLLECTED HUNDREDS OF

03:38:54.087 --> 03:38:55.388
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNDER THEIR

03:38:55.455 --> 03:38:57.791

03:38:57.858 --> 03:38:59.593
AS A COMMITTEES A SUMMARY

03:38:59.659 --> 03:39:01.361
INDICATES -- DAVID THE LARGEST

03:39:01.428 --> 03:39:02.696
SETTLEMENT WAS A THREE AND A

03:39:02.762 --> 03:39:04.698
THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT

03:39:04.764 --> 03:39:07.267
WITH SPRINT -- SO THEY'VE BEEN

03:39:07.334 --> 03:39:08.134
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

03:39:08.201 --> 03:39:10.504
SO WE'VE FOLLOW THEIR PATTERN

03:39:10.570 --> 03:39:11.605
BUT WE'VE MADE SOME WHAT WE

03:39:11.671 --> 03:39:13.640
THINK OR SOME IMPROVEMENTS.

03:39:13.707 --> 03:39:15.175

03:39:20.947 --> 03:39:22.849
UNLIKE NEW YORK WE SPECIFICALLY

03:39:22.916 --> 03:39:24.284
PUT IN A PROVISION THAT SAYS THE

03:39:24.351 --> 03:39:25.552
PRIVATE.

03:39:25.619 --> 03:39:27.988
PLAINTIFF CANNOT GET ACCESS TO

WE ALSO HAVE PLENTY OF AUTHORITY

03:39:32.726 --> 03:39:34.461
UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN

03:39:34.528 --> 03:39:35.295

WE CAN FORCES SETTLEMENT.

03:39:46.406 --> 03:39:46.973
WE CAN LIMIT THEIR PARTICIPATION

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:47.974
IN THE PROCEEDINGS.

03:39:48.041 --> 03:39:51.044
AND OUR EXPERIENCE.

03:39:51.111 --> 03:39:52.379
IS THAT WE WILL EXERCISE.

03:39:52.445 --> 03:39:53.980
THOSE REMEDIES MEANS WE DON'T

03:39:54.047 --> 03:39:55.315
WANT.

03:39:55.382 --> 03:39:59.185
OUR BOSS CLAIMS ACT WHICH WE USE

03:39:59.252 --> 03:40:01.087

TO BE USED FOR HARASSMENT.

03:40:02.455 --> 03:40:04.324
HELLO WE RESIST THAT I SHOULD

WE WOULD FOLLOW.

03:40:09.896 --> 03:40:10.997
IS THAT IT THEY MAKE IT CLEAR IF

03:40:11.064 --> 03:40:12.332
IT WASN'T ALREADY THAT IF THE

03:40:12.399 --> 03:40:14.467
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS

03:40:14.534 --> 03:40:15.902

03:40:16.903 --> 03:40:19.539
MERIT.

03:40:19.606 --> 03:40:20.874
DECLINES THE CASE THAT SENDS A

03:40:20.941 --> 03:40:22.642

THAT WE ARE.

03:41:02.382 --> 03:41:03.550
WORKING ON IN LIGHT OF THE

03:41:03.617 --> 03:41:05.352
OPPOSITION BUT THE PURPOSE OF

03:41:05.418 --> 03:41:07.354

03:41:14.027 --> 03:41:16.529
APPROPRIATELY TO DO WHATEVER WE

03:41:31.177 --> 03:41:34.347
THREAT OF USING A PROVISION LIKE

03:41:34.414 --> 03:41:36.616

THAT THERE HAS BEEN TAX FRAUD.

03:41:42.555 --> 03:41:43.957
WE SHOULD BE ALLOWING THE

03:41:44.024 --> 03:41:44.991
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER

03:41:45.058 --> 03:41:46.526
THAT TAX FRAUD IN THE PENALTIES

03:41:46.593 --> 03:41:48.228

03:41:48.294 --> 03:41:49.696
OVERALL WHAT IT COSTS TAXPAYERS

03:41:49.763 --> 03:41:52.198

03:51:01.614 --> 03:51:02.215
OUR FOCUS THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH

03:51:02.281 --> 03:51:02.815
IN THIS COMMITTEE IS LARGELY

03:51:02.882 --> 03:51:04.684
FOCUSED ON OUR CONCERNS ABOUT

03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:05.718
THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN NO

03:51:05.785 --> 03:51:08.654
FISCAL ANALYSIS DONE.

03:51:08.721 --> 03:51:11.357
OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

03:51:11.424 --> 03:51:12.825
CONSEQUENCES ARE.

03:51:12.892 --> 03:51:14.627
THE CIVIC LEE WITH RESPECT TO

03:51:14.694 --> 03:51:15.895
THE RATE OF GROWTH IN A

03:51:15.962 --> 03:51:18.097
RELATIVELY SMALL COMMUNITIES.

03:51:18.164 --> 03:51:20.132
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL ANALYSIS

03:51:20.199 --> 03:51:22.301
THAT WAS PERFORMED BY MS WONG

03:51:22.368 --> 03:51:24.036
FOR THE SENATE.

03:51:24.103 --> 03:51:26.839
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE

03:51:26.906 --> 03:51:28.241

SHE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES THAT

03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:32.311
WE'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:51:32.378 --> 03:51:33.980
AND THAT IS IS THAT.

03:51:34.046 --> 03:51:35.781
IF YOU HAVE A VERY FAST RATE OF

03:51:35.848 --> 03:51:38.718
GROWTH WITH THE GENERAL PLANS

03:51:38.784 --> 03:51:40.119
BEING AS THEY ARE NONE OF THEM

03:51:40.186 --> 03:51:42.888
ANTICIPATED WHAT'S HAPPENED SO.

03:51:42.955 --> 03:51:45.258
TO THE EXTENT THE CHIU GENESIS

03:51:45.324 --> 03:51:47.360
THE RAY SHOULD RATE OF GROWTH

03:51:47.426 --> 03:51:49.729
AND THE BUILDING SPEED WHICH THE

03:51:49.795 --> 03:51:51.130
BILL IS INTENDED TO DO.

03:51:51.197 --> 03:51:52.465
YOU'RE GONNA SENSUALLY BLOW OUT

03:51:52.531 --> 03:51:53.799
THE GENERAL PLAN IN THE SMALL

03:51:53.866 --> 03:51:54.900
COMMUNITIES.

03:51:54.967 --> 03:51:56.035

ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL.

03:52:02.808 --> 03:52:04.176
SECONDLY WE DON'T THINK THAT THE

03:52:04.243 --> 03:52:07.013
SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS NECESSARY IF

03:52:07.079 --> 03:52:08.848

MORE CUMULATIVELY OR OTHERWISE.

03:52:22.862 --> 03:52:23.863
IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION

03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:25.865

03:56:34.547 --> 03:56:35.114
FOR FIFTY YEARS.

03:56:35.180 --> 03:56:36.081
ANAHEIM AN ACTIVIST AS WELL I

03:56:36.148 --> 03:56:37.416
WAS ON THE GENERAL PLAN TASK

03:56:37.483 --> 03:56:38.717
FORCE IN CHICO.

03:56:38.784 --> 03:56:41.887
AND ALSO STARTED THE CAR TO GO

03:56:41.954 --> 03:56:43.222
SUSTAINABILITY GROUP -- AND I

03:56:43.289 --> 03:56:43.889
THINK YOU KNOW JUST A FEW

03:56:43.956 --> 03:56:46.358
COMMENTS ONE IS THAT THERE.

03:56:46.425 --> 03:56:49.061
IS NO EVIDENCE YET THAT THE CAMP

03:56:49.128 --> 03:56:51.764
FIRE VICTIMS CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD

03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:54.533
THE HOUSING THIS PROPOSED.

03:56:54.600 --> 03:56:55.067
FOR EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY WE

03:56:55.134 --> 03:56:56.068
BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE MORE

03:56:56.135 --> 03:56:58.137
DOWNS BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:56:58.203 --> 03:56:59.972
MORE DATA AND I THINK I'M WITH

03:57:00.039 --> 03:57:01.340
THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT THAT

03:57:01.407 --> 03:57:02.875
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ANALYSIS

03:57:02.942 --> 03:57:03.876
MADE.

03:57:03.943 --> 03:57:06.412
BEFORE GOES FORWARD.

03:57:06.478 --> 03:57:08.714
AND ALSO -- I THINK IN THE LAST

03:57:08.781 --> 03:57:09.648
TEN YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S

03:57:09.715 --> 03:57:12.618
REALLY FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:57:12.685 --> 03:57:15.888
AND CARBON EMISSIONS AND YOU.

03:57:15.955 --> 03:57:17.356
ALSO CALLED THIS EARLIER A

03:57:17.423 --> 03:57:19.325
CRITICAL ISSUE AND THE PROPOSED

03:57:19.391 --> 03:57:20.960
DEVELOPMENT WILL CREATE COMMUTER

03:57:21.026 --> 03:57:22.227
TRAFFIC.

03:57:22.294 --> 03:57:23.662
AND CARBON EMISSIONS WHICH CAN'T

03:57:23.729 --> 03:57:25.130
BE MITIGATED.

03:57:25.197 --> 03:57:27.633
SO THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT IS

03:57:27.700 --> 03:57:29.468
CREATING MORE CONDITIONS WHICH

03:57:29.535 --> 03:57:32.304
EXASPERATED THE CAMPFIRE

03:57:32.371 --> 03:57:32.605

04:00:07.960 --> 04:00:10.129
CITIES.

04:00:10.195 --> 04:00:10.662
THAT WENT THROUGH A LOT OF

04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:12.831
SCRUTINY -- AND THAT PEOPLE HAVE

04:00:12.898 --> 04:00:15.634
MADE PLANS TO DO RESIDENTIAL

SHOULD LIVE IN DANCE.

04:00:36.722 --> 04:00:38.824
HOUSING OBVIOUSLY NOT KNOWING

04:00:38.891 --> 04:00:40.325
THAT NINE THOUSAND HOMES IN

04:00:40.392 --> 04:00:42.661
PARADISE WERE SINGLE FAMILY

04:00:42.728 --> 04:00:43.495

04:01:09.321 --> 04:01:09.721
THE POINT.

04:01:09.788 --> 04:01:11.323
THAT DOES NEED TO BE PART OF THE

04:01:11.390 --> 04:01:13.025

04:47:53.422 --> 04:47:54.690
AVAILABILITY OF THE EXISTING

04:47:54.757 --> 04:47:56.559
HOUSING STOCK IN CALIFORNIA.

04:47:56.626 --> 04:47:57.627
I ALSO WANT TO TAKE AN

04:47:57.693 --> 04:47:58.561
OPPORTUNITY JUST SPELL SOME

04:47:58.628 --> 04:48:00.129
MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE AGE TO

04:48:00.196 --> 04:48:01.697
A PROGRAM THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S

04:48:01.764 --> 04:48:03.366
A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY.

04:48:03.432 --> 04:48:04.266
THE TRICK PROGRAM'S BEEN IN

04:48:04.333 --> 04:48:05.334
PLACE FOR ALMOST THIRTY FIVE

04:48:05.401 --> 04:48:07.269
YEARS WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE BEST

04:48:07.336 --> 04:48:09.005
AND WE ADVOCATE ON A FEDERAL

04:48:09.071 --> 04:48:09.572
LEVEL FOR CHANGES FOR THAT

04:48:09.639 --> 04:48:11.941
PROGRAM.

04:48:12.008 --> 04:48:13.676
AT THE SECOND IS THAT.

04:48:13.743 --> 04:48:15.211
THE TREE PROGRAMS UTILIZED ONLY

04:48:15.277 --> 04:48:16.278
BY LARGE SCALE FARMS THAT'S NOT

04:48:16.345 --> 04:48:17.079
CORRECT TO FORM OF ALL SHAPES

04:48:17.146 --> 04:48:18.914
AND SIZES PRODUCTION STYLES AND

04:48:18.981 --> 04:48:20.950
REGION'S UTILIZE EMPLOYEES FROM

04:48:21.017 --> 04:48:22.718
THE H. TO A PROGRAM -- AND SO IF

04:48:22.785 --> 04:48:23.819
THE PERSPECTIVE IS TO WITHHOLD

04:48:23.886 --> 04:48:25.354
FUNDS IN THIS BILL FROM THOSE

04:48:25.421 --> 04:48:27.289
WHO HAVE A READILY AVAILABLE

04:48:27.356 --> 04:48:28.624
ABILITY TO PAY.

04:48:28.691 --> 04:48:30.126
THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- AND THEN

04:48:30.192 --> 04:48:32.228
FINALLY IT'S NOT AS THOUGH --

04:48:32.294 --> 04:48:33.329
ALL FORMS EITHER UTILIZED

04:48:33.396 --> 04:48:34.530
COLLEGE TO EMPLOYEES OR NO AGE

04:48:34.597 --> 04:48:36.298
TO EMPLOYEES WE HAVE A LOT OF

04:48:36.365 --> 04:48:39.101
FARMS THAT UTILIZE A MIX OF AGE

04:48:39.168 --> 04:48:39.769
TO WEIGH IN ON EACH -- TO EIGHT

04:48:39.835 --> 04:48:41.037
SO UNDER THIS BILL IF I HAD A

04:48:41.103 --> 04:48:43.673
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND ONE

04:48:43.739 --> 04:48:44.206
HAPPENED TO BE IN AGE TO

04:48:44.273 --> 04:48:44.807
EMPLOYEE I WOULD BE PRECLUDED

04:48:44.874 --> 04:48:48.544
FROM USING ANY STATE FUNDING TO

04:48:48.611 --> 04:48:50.112
BUILD FOR THE REMAINING.

04:48:50.179 --> 04:48:51.113
NINETY NINE WE DON'T THINK THAT

04:48:51.180 --> 04:48:51.781
A SERVICE THE BROADER PURPOSE --

04:48:51.847 --> 04:48:52.615
RESTRICTING FUNDING FROM ONE

04:48:52.682 --> 04:48:53.482
GROUP ACTUALLY RESTRICTS FUNDING

04:48:53.549 --> 04:48:54.817
FROM ALL AND WE DON'T BELIEVE

04:48:54.884 --> 04:48:56.619
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD

04:48:56.686 --> 04:48:57.953
BE A ZERO SUM GAME.

04:48:58.020 --> 04:48:59.121
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS

04:48:59.188 --> 04:49:00.222
ABOUT THE INCENTIVE OFFERED IN

04:49:00.289 --> 04:49:01.691
THE BILL THE WE CAN APPRECIATE

04:49:01.757 --> 04:49:03.659
IT IS A TOOL THAT THE AUTHOR IS

04:49:03.726 --> 04:49:05.528
OFFERING JUST ONE OF MANY --

04:49:05.594 --> 04:49:07.229
IT'S REALLY AND ACCESSIBLE.

04:49:07.296 --> 04:49:08.431
A FORMER BE RESPONSIBLE UNDER

04:49:08.497 --> 04:49:09.598
THIS BILL FOR FUNDING AND

04:49:09.665 --> 04:49:10.933
CONSTRUCTING A HOUSING UNIT AND

04:49:11.000 --> 04:49:12.868
THEN SEATING ALL OPERATION AND

04:49:12.935 --> 04:49:13.602
MANAGEMENT OF IT TO A THIRD

04:49:13.669 --> 04:49:14.270
PARTY.

04:49:14.336 --> 04:49:16.172
WELL THE RETAIN ALL LIABILITY

04:49:16.238 --> 04:49:18.007
AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT IS

04:49:18.074 --> 04:49:19.542
TOO MUCH OF A RISK FOR OUR

04:49:19.608 --> 04:49:21.744
PARTIES TO TAKE -- YOU HAVE TO

04:49:21.811 --> 04:49:22.845
BE A RISK TAKER TO BE A FARMER

04:49:22.912 --> 04:49:24.146
YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF NATURE

04:49:24.213 --> 04:49:25.915
AND THE MARKET -- BUT WE DON'T

04:49:25.981 --> 04:49:28.718
BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYEES HOUSING

04:49:28.784 --> 04:49:29.318
SHOULD BE SOMETHING YOU GAMBLE

04:49:29.385 --> 04:49:31.120
ON ONCE AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE

04:49:31.187 --> 04:49:31.787
ATTENTION OF THE PROBLEM BUT THE

04:49:31.854 --> 04:49:33.789
BUILDING OF THE CARE THAT WE

04:49:33.856 --> 04:49:35.825
JUST CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WE

04:49:35.891 --> 04:49:37.593
BELIEVE PERHAPS MOST ACUTELY ARE

04:49:37.660 --> 04:49:38.661
FROM COMMUNITIES HAVE SERIES

04:49:38.728 --> 04:49:40.096
HOUSING PROBLEMS AND WE NEED

04:49:40.162 --> 04:49:40.362
SERIOUS.

04:49:40.429 --> 04:49:42.264
SOLUTIONS THE DEPLORABLE

04:49:42.331 --> 04:49:44.033
STANDARDS THAT -- THE AUTHOR AND

04:49:44.100 --> 04:49:45.034
SPONSOR DESCRIBED IS IN THE

04:49:45.101 --> 04:49:46.569
ABSENCE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED

04:49:46.635 --> 04:49:48.504
HOUSING WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED TO

04:49:48.571 --> 04:49:50.506
ADVOCATE FOR IN THIS BILL --

04:49:50.573 --> 04:49:51.674
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THESE FUNDING

04:49:51.741 --> 04:49:53.976
RESTRICTIONS AND THE INCENTIVE

04:49:54.043 --> 04:49:55.511
AS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY WE

04:49:55.578 --> 04:49:57.713
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL.

04:49:57.780 --> 04:50:00.015
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

04:50:00.082 --> 04:50:01.250

WINE GRAPE GROWERS -- WE ARE

04:50:04.854 --> 04:50:05.521

RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND THAT

04:50:06.889 --> 04:50:08.023
TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

04:50:08.090 --> 04:50:09.525
BILL IN ANY KAMALA THE PROCESS

04:50:09.592 --> 04:50:11.894
BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR

04:50:11.961 --> 04:50:13.996
WHOLE HEARTEDLY THERE IS A

04:50:14.063 --> 04:50:15.364
SERIOUS PROBLEM.

04:50:15.431 --> 04:50:17.133
AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT.

04:50:17.199 --> 04:50:19.602
BUT THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION.

04:50:19.668 --> 04:50:22.271
IN ACTUALITY BECAUSE LOOK AT A

04:50:22.338 --> 04:50:24.340
COMMON SPEND FARM BUREAU.

04:50:24.406 --> 04:50:25.241
WE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

04:50:25.307 --> 04:50:26.208
COMMENTS WE ACTUALLY THINK THIS

04:50:26.275 --> 04:50:26.876
BILL ACTUALLY GOES OUT TO

04:50:26.942 --> 04:50:27.877
DIRECTOR OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM.

04:50:27.943 --> 04:50:29.311
WE WERE HOPEFUL THAT ALONG THE

04:50:29.378 --> 04:50:30.279
WAY BECAUSE THE COMMANDER THE

04:50:30.346 --> 04:50:31.514
AUTHOR WHICH WE TOTALLY RESPECT

04:50:31.580 --> 04:50:32.782
APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS COULD B

04:50:32.848 --> 04:50:34.350
WORKED OUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF

04:50:34.416 --> 04:50:35.484
THE CONCERNS.

04:50:35.551 --> 04:50:36.252
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED SO

04:50:36.318 --> 04:50:37.386
REGRETFULLY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN

04:50:37.453 --> 04:50:39.655
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

04:50:39.722 --> 04:50:40.523
FUNDAMENTALLY THE BILL IS A

04:50:40.589 --> 04:50:42.024
WORKABLE IT'S JUST AN UNWORKABLE

04:50:42.091 --> 04:50:43.859
APPROACH OF DOES WORK FOR THREE

04:50:43.926 --> 04:50:45.761
REASONS ONE IT ACTUALLY REDUCES

04:50:45.828 --> 04:50:47.496
FUNDING FOR HOUSING AT A TIME

04:50:47.563 --> 04:50:49.298
WHEN FUNDING IS CRITICALLY

04:50:49.365 --> 04:50:51.433
NEEDED. FOR TO US THAT DOESN'T

04:50:51.500 --> 04:50:53.068
MAKE ANY SENSE -- TO UNDER THIS

04:50:53.135 --> 04:50:54.537
BILL LANDOWNERS WILL BE EXPOSED

04:50:54.603 --> 04:50:55.638
TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY BECAUSE

04:50:55.704 --> 04:50:56.939
OF THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT

04:50:57.006 --> 04:50:59.074
REQUIRED UNDER THE BILL.

04:50:59.141 --> 04:51:00.242
WHICH IS AS POINTED OUT MAKES IT

04:51:00.309 --> 04:51:01.844
A WORKABLE THREE THE BILL

04:51:01.911 --> 04:51:04.046
CREATES A STREAMLINED PROCESS.

04:51:04.113 --> 04:51:06.215
THAT JUST DOES NOT WORK.

04:51:06.282 --> 04:51:08.284
AND WHILE IT IS REFERRED TO AS

04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:09.318
ADOPTED IN.

04:51:09.385 --> 04:51:12.321
IF IT HAS A 0% CHANCE OF SUCCESS

04:51:12.388 --> 04:51:14.123
NO ONE'S GOING TO OPT IN THERE'S

04:51:14.190 --> 04:51:16.659
NOTHING TO OPT INTO.

04:51:16.725 --> 04:51:17.560
IT REALLY IS DOWN UP DOWN.

04:51:17.626 --> 04:51:18.694
BECAUSE OF THE REDUCE WORKFORCE

04:51:18.761 --> 04:51:20.729
MORE MORE GROWERS ARE HIRING AGE

04:51:20.796 --> 04:51:21.530
TO A WORKERS.

04:51:21.597 --> 04:51:23.666
IT AS IF IT'S A FACT OF THE

04:51:23.732 --> 04:51:25.568
INDUSTRY AND SITUATION WE HAVE

04:51:25.634 --> 04:51:28.103
TODAY -- I'VE TOUR IS TO A

04:51:28.170 --> 04:51:29.505
HOUSING I'VE DESERVE THE HOUSING

04:51:29.572 --> 04:51:30.372
AND HAVE TO PUT A GET TOGETHER

04:51:30.439 --> 04:51:31.740
TOWARDS FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE

04:51:31.807 --> 04:51:34.476
THAT HOUSING IS NOT SUB STANDARD

04:51:34.543 --> 04:51:35.077
IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER.

04:51:35.144 --> 04:51:35.978
IT IS.

04:51:36.045 --> 04:51:39.281
FINE HOUSING -- IT IS OF

04:51:39.348 --> 04:51:41.350
REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW IT IS

04:51:41.417 --> 04:51:43.419
EXPECTED ELLIE BY THE STATE IS

04:51:43.485 --> 04:51:44.253
APPROVED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF

04:51:44.320 --> 04:51:45.721
LABOR -- AND TO GO OUT THAT

04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:47.389
HOUSING I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT

04:51:47.456 --> 04:51:48.924
THE REASON IS ESPECIALLY SINCE

04:51:48.991 --> 04:51:50.726
THAT HOUSING IS ALSO USED TO

04:51:50.793 --> 04:51:58.033
HOUSE OTHER WORKERS -- WE AGREE

04:51:58.100 --> 04:51:58.500
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

04:51:58.567 --> 04:51:59.368
STREAMLINED PROCESS BUT THE

04:51:59.435 --> 04:52:00.336
PROCESS HAS TO WORK A

04:52:00.402 --> 04:52:01.036
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THIS

04:52:01.103 --> 04:52:02.838
PROCESS IS A NO LENDER IS GOING

04:52:02.905 --> 04:52:03.706
TO LEND MONEY FOR THIS KIND OF

04:52:03.772 --> 04:52:04.306
HOUSING.

04:52:04.373 --> 04:52:05.274
IF YOU'RE A LENDER AND GROW

04:52:05.341 --> 04:52:06.442
COMES USES A HEY I WANT TO TAKE

04:52:06.508 --> 04:52:07.843
VENGEANCE STREAMLINED PROCESS I

04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:09.345
NEED A LOAN THE LENDER IS GOING

04:52:09.411 --> 04:52:09.845
TO SAY.

04:52:09.912 --> 04:52:10.713
HOW MUCH OF A GOOD FOR CLOSE ON

04:52:10.779 --> 04:52:12.414
THE PROPERTY WHEN THIS CAN BE A

04:52:12.481 --> 04:52:13.582
FIFTY FIVE YEAR CONDITION ON

04:52:13.649 --> 04:52:15.284
THAT PROPERTY WITH A THIRD PARTY

04:52:15.351 --> 04:52:16.418
MANAGEMENT COMPANY?

04:52:16.485 --> 04:52:19.521
ON TOP OF THAT WELL THE SPONSORS

04:52:19.588 --> 04:52:20.723
CLAIM THAT THEY WANNA SEPARATION

04:52:20.789 --> 04:52:22.091
TO THE LANDLORD OF THE EMPLOYER

04:52:22.157 --> 04:52:23.325
THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO

04:52:23.392 --> 04:52:23.792
THAT.

04:52:23.859 --> 04:52:25.761
BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER STILL ON

04:52:25.828 --> 04:52:27.363
THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING SO WHAT

04:52:27.429 --> 04:52:29.398
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS IF

04:52:29.465 --> 04:52:30.132
THERE'S A MANAGEMENT COMPANY

04:52:30.199 --> 04:52:31.667
DOING IT THEY SHOULD ASSUME ALL

04:52:31.734 --> 04:52:33.969
RESPONSIBILITY ALL LIABILITY SB

04:52:34.036 --> 04:52:34.970
TRANSPARENCY.

04:52:35.037 --> 04:52:35.971
THERE'S GOT TO BE A PROCESS

04:52:36.038 --> 04:52:37.640
WHERE YOU CAN NEGOTIATE BASED ON

04:52:37.706 --> 04:52:39.575
ON THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND

04:52:39.642 --> 04:52:40.075
A CAP IS SOMETHING WHERE

04:52:40.142 --> 04:52:41.076
SUDDENLY.

04:52:41.143 --> 04:52:43.245
THE THIRD PARTY COMES IN AND

04:52:43.312 --> 04:52:44.647
TAKES OVER THE OPERATIONS AND

04:52:44.713 --> 04:52:46.382
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROPERTY

04:52:46.448 --> 04:52:48.550
WHILE THE ROVER IS STILL ON THE

04:52:48.617 --> 04:52:49.818
HOOK FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THE

04:52:49.885 --> 04:52:52.021
