JUST TO OPEN IT UP- I KNOW ALL OF YOU WHO WERE HERE NO BUT- WITH THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WE LAUNCHED- ABOUT A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR EFFORT SOMEONE TIME SOMEONE GOING AT THE TIME. TO ESTABLISH A NEW SEPARATE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH THE NEW PRESIDENT TO NEW ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM. CREATING A NEW ONLINE CURRICULUM TO SERVICE A LARGE GROUP OF WORKERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME. DESCRIBED AS STRANDED. SINCE WE ARE NOW BEGINNING THE SECOND YEAR OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION PROCESS- AND SINCE THE TWO OF US WERE NOT IN THESE CHAIRS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME THAT THIS ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONCEPT WAS HATCHED. IN THE SHIP WAS LAUNCHED. WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKEN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONCEPT AS WELL AS THE STATUS OF THE ROLL OUT- AND IMPLEMENTATION TO DATE. SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN IT OVER- TO MY SENATE EDUCATION CHAIRS SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA FOR ANY STATEMENTS THAT SHE MY WHICH TO MAKE AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I AM EXCITED THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM CALIBRATE REGARDING THE STATUS OF THE STATE'S ONLINE COLLEGE. AND PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THE STATUTORY DEADLINES THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE COLLEGE WHEN IT WAS ENACTED. HAVING FLEXIBLE AND AFFORDABLE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT CATER TO THE NEEDS O WORKING LEARNERS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR EDUCATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE WHEN IT COMES TO COURSE SCHEDULING AND TESTING SUPPORTS DURING NONTRADITIONAL HOURS. THAT IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION. THE CAL I PROPER MODEL TO HEARINGS THIS. THAT SAYS I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE HE HAVE A- WE GOT. A TRAJECTORY AND I'M OF THE SEA THOSE PRESS. THIS MONTH GIVEN THE RECENT MOVEMENT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF. THE EDGE MODEL. I AM FOR IN TO HEAR WE ARE NOW WHERE WE NEED BEAT BEST SIR TO AND WHAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ENSURETHAT CAL BRIGHT. CONTINUES TO MEET ITS DIRECTIVE I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE. BEFORE WE START WITH OUR- OVERVIEW OF- CALIBRATE COLLEGE HAVE BEEN JOINED BY SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES IMAGES TO. PASS THEM AT FIVE IF ANY OF THEM WANT TO MAKE A ANY BRIEF COMMENTS BEFORE WE START. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO RIGHT INTO THE OVERVIEW OF CALIBRATE COLLEGE AND IDEAS TO REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO JOIN US. FOR THAT OVERVIEW. SIR WHEN YOU COMFORTABLE PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU POLICY IN HOUSE IN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OF USER OF NICE TO BE HERE THANK YOU. SO THE SERGEANT IS DISTRIBUTING A HAND OUT IN THE HANDOUT CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN PARTS FIRST TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR CALIBRATE THEY HAND OT BEGINS WITH A BACKGROUND. OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND INITIATIVES IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM. THEY HAD OUT THEN TURNS TO WHAT. SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE WANTS HAS ASKED CAL RIGHT TO DO HOW MUCH FUNDING IS PROVIDED FOR CALIBRATE AND THEN I DO HAVE THAT IDENTIFIES MAJOR MILESTONES THAT CAL RIGHT MUST MEET OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SO IF YOU START ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. ALL ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LOCALLY RUN COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFER ONLINE COURSES. ONLINE COURSES REPRESENT ABOUT 17% OF OVERALL INSTRUCTION AMONG THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES IT'D HAVE BEEN OFFERING ONLINE INSTRUCTION WHICH IS UP FROM 7% A DECADE AGO. THAT THESE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES YOU MAINLY SEE ONLINE INSTRUCTION IN CREDIT COURSES SEARCHES PSYCHOLOGY OR HISTORY OR ENGLISH COURSES THAT ARE TRANSFERABLE TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY ARE YOU ALSO FIND- ONLINE INSTRUCTION SOME CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THE HAND OUT NOTES SO WEBSITE DESIGN AS AN EXAMPLE. STUDENTS TAKING ONLINE CLASSES CLASSES OFTEN TYPICALLY TAKE FACE TO FACE CLASSES AS WELL A COLLEGES WILL TELL YOU THAT ONLINE COURSES ARE AMONG THE VERY FIRST TO FILL UP OTHER POPULAR IN GENERAL WITH STUDENTS- BECAUSE STUDENTS. WE HEAR OF FIND IT BENEFICIAL TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A CLASS WHERE THEY ARE WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO- AND LEARN AND PROGRESS. ONLINE COURSES TYPICALLY FALL OF THE SAME- SEMESTER CALENDAR THAT SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN WEEKS SEMESTER CALENDAR THAT REGULAR FACE TO FACE CLASSES FOLLOW. OUR ONLINE INSTRUCTION GENERATES FOR COLLEGE IS THE SAME FUNDING RATE THE SINGAPORE SENATE RATE FROM- THE STATE AS REGULAR FACE TO FACE CLASSES AND ON STUDENTS TAKING ONLINE ONLINE CLASSES PAY THE SAME FEES STATUTORILY SET FEES OF REGULAR FACE TO FACE CLASSES THEY ALSO ON MY STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR. FEE WAIVER THERE FINANCIALLY NEEDY. AND THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR NON CREDIT ADULT EDUCATION COURSES OFFERED THROUGH THE COMMUNICATOR AGES AND THAT'S A PURSUANT TO STATE LAW. PAGE TWO DESCRIBES A COUPLE OF THE ONLINE INITIATIVES FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. MOST NOTABLY THE STATE PROVIDES TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY COLLEGES THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE AN ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL COMPONENTS INCLUDING TRAININGS FOR FACULTY IT'S STATEWIDE AND LOCAL LEVEL. A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THAT FACULTY CAN DELIVER COURSES- IN AN ONLINE FASHION. AND ALSO A SYSTEM THAT ALLOW STUDENTS FROM PARTICIPATING COLLEGES TO CROSS AND ROLE IN OTHER COLLEGES TAKING ONLINE CLASSES ACTUALLY PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA GOES INTO MORE DETAIL ON THAT ONLINE- LOOK OF COURSE EXCHANGE. PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT NOTES THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH COLLEGE WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AS CHAIR JUST NOTED. THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHICH OVERSEES THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE SYSTEM ALSO SERVES AS CAL RIGHTS OWN BOARD IT'S KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROVIDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME AND TO THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE THE ONE TIME FUNDS WERE INTENDED TO START UP COSTS COVERING EXPENSES SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION. THE ON FUNDS ARE FOR OPERATING COSTS SEARCHES OF. WHICH IS COMPENSATION FOR STAFF. IN ADDITION THE COLLEGE IS ELIGIBLE UNDER STATUTE TO CLAIM APPORTIONMENT STICK CLAIM STATE FUNDING FOR ANY ENROLLMENT SET HAS WHICH IS THE SAME AS OTHER COLLEGES. THE COLLEGE IS DIRECTED TO FOCUS ON CREATING SHORT TERM PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS THAT LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS GAINS AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE AND CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AT ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGES LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IT'S TO FOCUS ON AND ROLLING WORKING ADULTS WITH NO POST SECONDARY CREDENTIALS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY ACCESSING HIGHER EDUCATION NOT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF TIME FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS RATHER REASONS. NOW THE COLLEGES REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS IN COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY. AND FOR EACH NEW PROGRAM CREATED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MUST NOTIFY YOU MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION- ADMINISTRATION ON HOW THE PROGRAM IS NOT DUPLICATIVE OF PROGRAMS AND OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE COLLEGE IS ALSO TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO ACCELERATE THEIR LEARNING ACCELERATE THE COMPLETION OF A OF A PROGRAM THROUGH PRIOR LEARNING ASSESSMENT SIR OTHER WAYS THAT STUDENTS CAN SHOW WHAT THEY KNOW. AND THEREBY ADVANCE THROUGH THE PROGRAM. PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT NOTES ACCOUNT RIGHT GENERALLY MUST FOLLOW THE SAME RULES AS OTHER COLLEGES. THERE ISN'T- THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE HAND OUT NOTES- THAT THE COLLEGE EXEMPT FROM USING THE REGULAR STUDENT FEE STRUCTURE WHICH I DESCRIBED EARLIER. FINALLY PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT LISTS THE MAJOR STATUTORY MILESTONES THAT CAL BRIGHT MUST MEET. IN PARTICULAR CALIBRATE MUST START BY CREATING AT LEAST THREE PROGRAMS. AND TO HAVE BEEN ROLLED THE FIRST STUDENTS BY THE LAST PART OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CALIBRATE IN ADDITION MUST DEVELOP A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN PROGRAMS BY MID. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. AND PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES TO LEGISLATURE IN IN WRITTEN FORM AS WELL AS OF COURSE- APPEAR IN A AND HEARINGS THAT YOU CALL. CAL RIGHT ALSO MOST AVAILABLE PLAN FOR. OBTAINING ACCREDITATION AND ACTUALLY OBTAIN OCCUR ACCREDITATION BY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. SO WITH THAT ALL AND MY REMARKS IN HAPPENED IN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE CALLINGS ANY QUESTIONS FIRST LET ME TURN TO MY SENATE EDUCATION CHAIR CENTER LIVE A- GOOD RIGHT NOW THANK YOU ALEX ANY QUESTIONS OF THE LA DOCTRINE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OVERVIEW AND PRESENTATION- IS TALKING ABOUT- MILESTONES I'M SURE WE WILL BE HERE AT WE ARE GONNA BE HERE A STATUS REPORT FROM THE- COLLEGE SELF BUT FROM THE ALEJO'S PERSPECTIVE- WHERE. YOU KNOW IT'S WELL IT'S A TWENTY TWENTY SO YES THEY'RE STILL MANY MILESTONES AGO- IN YOUR X. EXAMINATION- HOW ON TRACTOR BEHIND TRACK ARE THEY- WELL YOU'LL HEAR- THE NEXT PANEL ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE CREATED SO FREE UP PROGRAMS. WERE CREATED- HELP RIGHT HAS STARTED TO ENROLL STUDENTS- INITIALLY AND A- A COURSE REALLY DESIGNED TO SEE F THIS IS THE RIGHT FIT FOR THE STUDENTS SO THEY HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED THERE. AND THEY HAVE THE ABOUT TWENTY ACTUALLY ROLLED IN THE THREE PROGRAMS I MENTIONED- THEY HAVE PROVIDED A STATUS REPORT THAT IS IN YOUR YOUR PACKET THERE- FAIRLY FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION- SO. I THINK YOU KNOW THEY- HIGHER THEIR THEIR CO NOW. CO HE'S LEAVING ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO. DEFINITELY THEY'VE BEEN EASY- AND- ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THESE GOALS AND- WE'LL HAVE TO SEE FROM YOU KNOW THE NEXT PANEL ABOUT THEIR FUTURE PLANS TO CONTINUE THAT TRAJECTORY. AND SO WHAT IS THE- LA- DOING TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE REPORT YOU BEING HERE SIDES THEY'D SO I KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE IS THE LA JOH MAYER'S. CAL BRIGHT SO WE AND GONNA HEAR AN UPDATE FROM THE ACTUAL. FOLKS WHO ARE DOING IT- BUT I JUST WANT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SORT OF OUR- YOU WORK FOR US SO I WANTED TO DIAL IN TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT- IT WHAT IS LA WILL. BUT LA AS PLANTS IN TERMS OF MONITORING CALIBRATE YEAH THAT'S- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU'D LEGISLATURE'S GIVEN CAL RIGHT A LOT OF MONEY. YES HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A ONE TIME IN AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY IN ONGOING. IN ADDITION TO GIVING CAL RIGHT THE OPPORTUNITY TO. OUR CLAIM STATE FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. INITIATIVE TO FOLLOW AND TO OVERSEE IT'S SOMETHING. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT IT BEFORE WE'VE DONE ANALYSES ON IT ALREADY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONSIDERING. THE WEATHER TO FIND THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW AND PROVIDE YOU WITH UPDATES WE OFTEN INCLUDE UPDATES IN OUR- FORMAL BUDGET ANALYSES WHEN THEY'RE PROPOSALS WE ALSO PROVIDE. WED POSTS AND OTHER UPDATES- TO LET YOU KNOW- WHAT ARE THE DEVELOPMENTS IN IF WE SEE SOMETHING THAT SAYS. IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT OKAY WELL I GUESS I'D SAY IS AS YOU'RE MONITORING THIS PROGRAM- I URGE YOU TO. LOOK AT FROM THIS FRAME ALL RIGHT- I MEAN WE COULD OF COURSE IS THE LEGISLATURE WE CAN DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY WE GIVE TO THIS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. BUT AND I'D CERTAINLY I THINK THE FUNDING THAT. WE PROVIDED FOR EDUCATION IS WORTHY. THE QUESTION IS THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEND THE HUNDRED MILLION PLUS THE TWENTY MILLION EVERY YEAR SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE LA I WAS LOOKING AT THIS- I THINK WHEN THE FRAME TO LOOK AT IT IS TO SAY. IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY. THE AT AND TO DRAW A COMPARISON BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE INVESTMENT WILL PUT IN HERE AND WHAT WHAT. WHAT WE HAVE GOTTEN AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO ALWAYS FIGURE THAT OUT IF WE HAD DECIDED TO PUT THE MONEY IN OUR EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DERRY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALL SET UP. THAT RATE HAS IT CETERA AND YEP BECAUSE WE USE YOU MENTIONED- THERE 17% READY ONLINE IN OUR EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THEY'RE DOING STUFF. SO THE QUESTION IS IT MAKES SENSE TO. BUT ALL THE OVERHEAD AND IT CETERA FOR THIS AS WE PREPARE FOR FIGHTING A UNIQUE PRODUCT THAT COULDN'T BE OBTAINED. BY OR- WE TOOK THE SAME ABOUT MONEY AND GAVE IT TO THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TODAY DO THE SAME OR EVEN MORE. I MEAN THAT'S A TRUE COMPARISON RIGHT IS THIS THE WISEST WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY ARE YOU GETTING THE BIGGEST RETURN FOR INVESTMENT- SO. SO I HOPE THAT AS THE ELLIE I WAS MONITORING THIS IS NOT MERELY LIKE DID YOU HIT THE STATUTORY DEADLINES. BUT IS THIS THE BEST WAY WE COULD SPEND OUR MONEY- IN TERMS OF. EDUCATION FOR AND HE CALLED SYSTEM YES NIGHT. WE WOULD AGREE- AND I WOULD KIND OF ADD TO THAT- WE HAS A- LOT OF. ONLINE INITIATIVES GOING ON IN THE STATE YOU HAVE THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES AND YOU HAVE CAL PRIDE WE HAD ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. WHICH YOU ALSO FIND. IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION LEARNING LAB. WHICH IS ALSO IN THE HAND OUT THAT'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONALLY SO. TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT COMING TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING THAT'S COHERENT AN INTEGRATED AND WORKING TOWARD THE SAME PURPOSE AS OPPOSED TO. DUPLICATION TO BEAM DUPLICATIVE AND- AND NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDING A COHERENT EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE VALUATIONS IN THE LA- AND- PLEASE LET US KNOW IF. YOU NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES OR ACCESS TO INFORMATION TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. CENTER ALSO YES THANK YOU- IN YOUR IN YOUR- PRESENTATION TO US THE ONE AREA THAT I DON'T SEE. YOU YOU YOU TELL US ABOUT THE FUNDING RIGHT THAT'S A HUNDRED MILLION AND TWENTY MILLION ON GOING. BUT I DON'T SEE WHERE YOU MADE THIS SORT OF AN ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT UP UNTIL NOW AND ANY OPINIONS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT. THE SPENDING THAT'S ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND HOW MUCH IS LEFT AS IT MAKES SENSE OR DOZEN THAT- SO COULD YOU. YES THAT'S SOMETHING WE COORDINATED WITH STAFF ON ABOUT. WHAT WE SHOULD COVER VERSES WHAT STAFF COVERS THE AGENDA IF YOU LOOK ON AGE IS TWO AND THREE OF THE GENDER THAT GOES INTO DETAIL. OF A SPENDING YOU CAN SEE ON MIDDLE OF PAGE TWO ON THE FUNDING THAT I MENTIONED AND THEN YOU'LL SEE AN UPDATE ON CAL GRANT CAL RIGHT SPENDING. ONE THING. TO THINK ABOUT. OTHER THAN WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE TWENTY MILLION ONGOING IS AT TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT GOING TO BE NEEDED REALLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS GIVEN THAT CALIBRATE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM APPORTIONMENT SINCE I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THEY HAVE OTHER PLANS- IN TO BRING IN REVENUE AS WELL SAID SOMETHING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT FUNDING AND WHETHER IT'S IT REALLY IS NEEDED AN ON GOING BASIS AS THE COLLEGE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. THE OTHER IS TO JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPENDING- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING REGULAR UPDATES ON THE SPENDING. SOMETHING THAT JUST JUMPED OUT TO ME IS THE MONEY SPENT ON CAPITAL OUTLAY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR AN ONLINE COLLEGE I THINK WE JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER IDEA BETTER SENSE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT IS FOR WHAT THAT. THAT MONEY IS REALLY NEEDED FOR. THE LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU MENTIONED ON PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT AND YOU MENTIONED IT ALSO- THAT 17% OF ALL INSTRUCTION A COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S TO ONLINE IS IT WORTH NOTING THAT ONLINE COURSES ARE DIFFERENT THAN COMPETENCY BASED ONLINE COURSES WHICH CAL BRIGHT REPRESENTS I THINK SOMETIMES WE COMPLETE THE TO AND THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT AS- THE LA LOOK AT THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A THAT IS A GOOD POINT- I DID MENTION THAT ONLINE COURSES AT THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES TYPICALLY ARE ON A SEMESTER. OR YOU KNOW QUARTER SYSTEM AT A FEW OF THE COLLEGES. AND SO. STUDENTS ARE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY USUALLY WITHIN A WEEK TO GET THERE TO GET THEIR WORK IN LOG IN. DO THAT WHATEVER ASSIGNMENT THEY HAVE TO DO THEY MIGHT HAVE UNTIL SAY MID NIGHT- ON SUNDAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO DO IT- BUT GENERALLY EVEN IF THEY KNOW THE MATERIAL THEY NEED TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT WEEK. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE STUDIES WERE IS THROUGH COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION STUDENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THROUGH ACCELERATE THROUGH THAT MATERIAL OR TAKE SOME EXTRA TIME IF THEY NEED IT- SO THERE IS THE SOME POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE TO COPY COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. WHAT TO. SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT'S TO COME. IN THIS- REVIEW. YOUR HANDLE REFERENCES TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS THAT'S F. T. E. THAT'S NOT TH TOTAL STUDENTS. ENROLLED IN ONLINE COURSES CORRECT CORRECT THAT SO IT'S MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF HEAD COUNT IN FACT OUR PREDECESSORS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WHEN WE WERE INITIALLY CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL. WERE PROVIDED WITH THE NET ANALYSIS THAT REFLECTS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFERED. FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINETY TWO ONLINE COURSES. AND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE ONLINE DEGREE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS IN THE- CALIFORNIA VIRTUAL CAMPUS CATALOG WITH ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONLINE COURSES DOES THAT SOUND ABOUT RIGHT YES IT'S AN AND WE I BELIEVE WE WERE ALSO TOLD AT ONE POINT. THE OF THE OF THESE THERE WERE SEVENTY THREE SHORT TERM FULLY ONLINE CERTIFICATES OF ACHIEVEMENT INCLUDED IN THAT PACKAGE IS THAT ALSO SOUND ABOUT RIGHT. YES OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY LET'S- LET'S INVITE OUR- PANEL OF THE TIME IF STEEN AND CHANCELLOR OAKLEY UP. MISTER PRESIDENT I PLAN SURE NAME CORRECTLY. EPSTEIN I APOLOGIZE WELL DON'T BE I HATE TO MISPRONOUNCE PEOPLE'S NAMES I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BOTH OF YOU. MR. THANK YOU- IT'S- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AGAIN- TO TALK ABOUT TO COVER A COLLEGE WHO GETTING GOOD MORNING CHAIR ROTH- CERTAINLY CHAIR LEYVA WHEN SHE STEPS BACK IN CENTERS PLATE SHOULD BE HERE WITH YOU ALL- MY NAME'S YOU ORTIZ OAKLEY AND HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS THE CHANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES- YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS THE PROGRESS OF OUR NEWEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE CALIBRATE COLLEGE- LESSON TWO YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE. TOOK A VERY BOLD STEP. TO HELP WORKING CALIFORNIANS AND I EMPHASIZE AND I'M GONNA TALK A LOT ABOUT WORKING CALIFORNIANS. IN MY REMARKS THIS IS A POPULATION THAT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN WELL SERVED. BY TRADITIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION MODELS OF POPULATION THAT IS THE ON GOING TARGET. OF FOR PROFITS AND NATIONAL NONPROFIT MAKE A UNIVERSITIES TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN ENROLLMENT HERE IN OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A YOU EXPANDED THE EXISTING HIGHER EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE A TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN ONLINE COLLEGE INTENTIONALLY FOCUSED. ON WORKING LEARNERS THE MANDATE WAS TO ESTABLISH IN VERY SHORT ORDER GRANTED WE'RE LESS THAN TWO YEARS FROM THE FIRST HEARING TODAY IN VERY SHORT ORDER TO ESTABLISH A COLLEGE- THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND FLEXIBLE FOR THOSE CONSTRAINED BY JOB AND FAMILY OBLIGATIONS A COLLEGE IT IS FULLY COMPETENCY BASED IN ALL SPEAK MORE ABOUT THAT DISTINCTION- THE COLLEGE IS FULLY COMPETENCY BASED AND FOCUSED ON SKILL ACQUISITION. AND JOB PLACEMENT THIS IS ABOUT JOB PLACEMENT FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING THE STUDENTS PRIOR LEARNING HELPING THEM OBTAIN AN EMPLOYER RECOGNIZED COLLEGE CREDENTIALS LET ME TAKE A MOMENT TO BETTER ARTICULATE COME SEE BASED EDUCATION WHAT DO WE MEAN BY C. B. E. KANSI BASED EDUCATION IS AN OUTCOME BASED APPROACH TO EARNING CREDENTIALS. C. B. E. IS A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT TRANSCRIPTION AND SUB AND IT ALSO SUPPORTS COHESIVE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE. INDIVIDUAL STUDENT MASTERY. A STUDENTS ACQUIRE AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS BY ENGAGING LEARNING EXPERIENCES LEARNING EXERCISES ACTIVITIES AND EXPERIENCES THAT ALIGN WITH CLEARLY DEFINED PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES. STUDENTS RECEIVE PROACTIVE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FROM FACULTY AND STAFF LEARNERS ARE IN CREDENTIALS BY DEMONSTRATING MASTERY AND I EMPHASIZE THE WORD MASTERY BECAUSE THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE ON HOW WE TYPICALLY PROVIDE INSTRUCTION IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. HERE INCOMES IT SAID YOU CATIONS FOCUS ON WHAT THE STUDENT MASTERS NOT HOW LONG THE STUDENT IS IN THE CLASSROOM THE- MASTERY TO MULTIPLE FORMS OF ASSESSMENT OFTEN AT A PERSONALIZED PACE AGAIN. IF YOU THINK ABOUT TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM. YOU WERE THERE FOR A SEMESTER REGARDLESS HOW QUICKLY OR NOT YOU GAIN MASTERY OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. THE TIME BEGINS AND ENDS AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THIS COUNTRY ARTIST. AT THEIR PACE SO YOU COULD HAVE. TEN STUDENTS IN ONE CLASSROOM ALL PROGRESSING AT DIFFERENT PACES THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR WORKING LEARNERS. BECAUSE HE BE IS FOCUSED ON DEMONSTRATING SKILL MASTERY IS AN OUTCOME RATHER THAN STE A C. TIME PROXY. THE LEARNING MODEL BETTER TRANSLATES TO THE SKILLED NEEDS OF HIRING EMPLOYERS THIS MODEL BY THE WAY HAS BEEN GROWING TREMENDOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE NATION- N. AS A STATE WE ARE JUST NOW STARTING TO TALK ABOUT IT IN OUR SYSTEM OF. OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS FULFILLING ITS OVERSIGHT OBLIGATIONS YOU HAVE CHARGED OUR OFFICE WITH ENSURING OVERSIGHT NOT ONLY OF CAL BRIGHT BUT ALL OVER A HUNDRED FIFTEEN COLLEGES. WE'RE REVIEWING THE PROGRESS OF CALIBRATE AND RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THE PROGRESS IT'S MAKING WE REVIEW THE FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT COVERAGE SUBMITS AS WE DO FOR EVERYONE OF OUR COLLEGES. AND I CAN TELL YOU TODAY THEY HAVE SUBMITTED EVERY SINGLE REQUIRED FINANCIAL REPORT THAT WE REQUIRE OF ALL OF OUR COLLEGES. FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING- THERE- ANNUAL- INDEPENDENT AUDIT AS WE SPEAK. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE COLLEGE IS IN ITS INFANCY AND NOT ALL OF ITS REPORTING SYSTEMS IN TEACHING LEARNING MODELS HAVE BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED I EXPECT THAT MY OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THEIR FINANCES AS WELL AS A TITLE FIVE COMPLIANCE AS WE DO FOR ALL OF OUR COLLEGE. WELL AT TIMES THE ROAD HAS BEEN ROCKY I BELIEVE CAL PRIZE WELL ON ITS WAY TO ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED AND THAT- MY OFFICE EXPECTS OF THEM. ON THE QUESTION A DUPLICATION THIS QUESTION KEEPS COMING UP- SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. YOU RECEIVE MY OFFICES ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE AS TO WHY WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE INITIAL PATHWAYS ARE NOT DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER PROGRAMS IN OUR SYSTEM THAT IS. OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND WE HAVE- THE CAPABILITY IN OUR OFFICE OUR GENERAL COUNSEL AND SEVERAL LAWYRS WHO HAVE LOOKED AT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND IT MADE THIS DETERMINATION. NOW WITH ANY CAREER PATHWAY THAT CALIBRATE OF WELL UPS THERE WILL BE ELEMENTS. OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE CONTENT THAT CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HOWEVER THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE LIES IN THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE PATHWAYS LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT I'M SURE YOU ALL CAN RELATE TO- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE CSU OFFER DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AND CYBERSECURITY. CALIBRATE ALSO OFFERS- TRAINING CYBERSECURITY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CERTIFICATE AND A CSU PASSERS WELL THEY'RE BOTH CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMS AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS IN BOTH PROGRAMS THAT LOOK VERY MUCH THE SAME IT IS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF CREDENTIALING. A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO A CERTIFICATE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT CYBERSECURITY NOR IS A CERTIFICATE NICK YOU COLLEGES EQUAL TO THE KIND OF CERTIFICATION CREDENTIALING THIS PROVIDED A COP RIGHT THESE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERTISE WITHIN THE FIELD OF CYBER SECURITY. SO YES IT IS EASY TO THINK THAT THEY ARE DUPLICATIVE BUT THEY ARE NOT JUSTICE. WE ARE NOT DUPLICATING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THE CSU. THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT AND SPEAK TO THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF COVERAGE MISSION TO FLEXIBLY AND INTENTIONALLY PROVIDE PATHWAYS INTO THE WORK FORCE. THE DELIVERY MODEL THE CONCISE NATURE OF THE SKILLS BEING MASTERED THE DESIGN OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LEARNERS CALIBRATE IN THE EMPLOYER PARTNERS. THIS THIS THREE LIKE IT'S TOOL IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF CAB RIGHT AS IT MUST ENGAGE WITH THE EMPLOYER AS WELL AS THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT. REPRESENT THESE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE S. YEAH YOU HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE HELPING US UNDERSTAND HOW TO BETTER SERVE THEM- FURTHERMORE THE PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR INTENTIONAL DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE AND TO CUSTOMIZE A LEARNER'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE PACE AND LEARNING NEEDS. SO ANOTHER QUESTION YOU RAISED WHY DOES CAL BRIGHT NEED TO BE A SEPARATE ENTITY. THIS DEBATE AND DISCUSS IN THE INITIAL THIS TUNES OVER CALIBRATE. AT THIS. WITH YOU THE FIRST ON THIS ITS CREW IMPORTANT AT THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF THE FACULTY AND THE STAFF BE FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE LEARNING SCIENCE IN THE NEEDS OF WORKING LEARNERS. THIS IS ALL THIS FACULTY AND STAFF ARE ASKED TO DO SERVE WORKING LEARNERS A GROWING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THE NEEDS ACCESS TO QUALITY CREDENTIALS. UNLIKE MOST OF OUR THE COLLEGES CALIBRATED SOLELY FOCUS ON THAT ONE MISSION. TO PROVIDE UPSCALING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING LEARNERS AND MEASURABLE ATTAINMENT AS WELL AS ECONOMIC MOBILITY. THIS PROVIDES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS YOU THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE ABILITY TO CLEARLY EVALUATE OUTCOME DATA AND NARROWLY FOCUSED ATTENTION ON KEY MILESTONES IN ADDITION THE COLLEGE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DEVELOP NEW FACULTY ROLES THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH ITS ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP CREATING NEW MODELS FOR BARGAINING UNITS. FOR BARGAINING CONTRACTS THAT REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF THE NEW TEACHING FACULTY AND SWELLED TO CLASSIFY JOBS ARE GOING TO BE CREATED BY CALIBRATE. NOW WE ALSO SEE THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IN THIS CASE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ABLE TO SERVE STATE NEEDS NOT JUST LOCAL NEEDS OUR OTHER SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS ARE LOCALLY ELECTED AND GOVERN LOCALLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IN SOME WAYS A VERY PAROCHIAL. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ALLOWS FOR GOVERNANCE ACROSS THE STATE. AND I'LL EMPHASIZE THAT. THIS BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS A DIRECT CONNECTION TO YOU AS YOU CONFIRM EVERY MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES SO YOU HAVE DIRECT ACCESS AND INFLUENCE OVER THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS ENTITY THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY. A SET UP. AT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS IN INNOVATION ALLIANCES WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON WITH OTHER COLLEGES CALIBRATE CAN ALSO QUICKLY DISSEMINATE THE NEW TEACHING LEARNING METHODS DEVELOPS WITH OTHER COLLEGES WISHING TO REPLICATE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE NEW INNOVATIONS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THIS IS ABOUT ADDING TO THE CAPACITY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOT REMOVING CAPACITY FINALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE TRADITIONAL AROMA GROWTH IS DECLINING AND THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION. AND WE SEE NONTRADITIONAL FOR PROFIT AND NOT FOR PROFIT PROGRAMS LIKE SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE- THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX WESTERN GOVERNORS AN ISSUE ALL SEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA IN THEIR ENROLLMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFERING A NONTRADITIONAL PATHWAY TO OUR STUDENTS I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS ITS OWN RESPONSE A RESPONSE THAT IS BOTH PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I BELIEVE THAT RISK. IT CAL BRIGHT NOW LET ME POSE STORY ONE OF THE CAL BRED LEARNERS LEARNERS TRINIDAD UNITS AT FIFTY EIGHT MISSED UNION AS AS A FULL TIME JOB AND SHE ESTIMATES THAT SHE MUST WORK ANOTHER TEN TO FIFTEEN MORE YEARS BEFORE RETIRING SHE COMMUTES FROM RIVERSIDE TO VENICE AND SO- CHAIR ROTH YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT COMMUTE- THAT'S HOW FOR SHE COMMUTES FOR HER JOB SHE ALSO CARES FOR HER MOTHER. FOR HER ARE OLDER FATHER. MR SAYS THE CAL I'D SUPPORT PROGRAM IS THE RIGHT FIT FOR HER AND SEES IT COMPLEMENTING HER SKILLS FROM PREVIOUS CAREER IN SYSTEM AS BEING A PREVIOUS KOREAN SYSTEM ANALYSTS CALIBRATED SERVING HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS LIKE THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE MORE SO I ASKED THIS BOY. TO ALLOW CALIBRATE THE TIME IT NEEDS TO FULLY DEVELOP AND TO SERVE MORE CALIFORNIANS LIKE TRINIDAD THANK YOU FOR THE TIME- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. CANCER PRESIDENT SIGN THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH AND OTHER SENATORS THANK YOU- AS YOU'VE HEARD MY NAME IS TOM EPSTEIN AND I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF BOTH CAL RIGHT BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I FEEL RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH OF IT I WANT TO SEE THE SUCCESSOF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OTHER COLLEGES WELL AS COUNT RIGHT SO I TAKETHIS RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT COUNT RIGHT THIS IS MY FIRST CHANCE TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR CONSISTENT SO PORT FOR THE BECAUSE SYSTEM AND AS WELL VOTE TO ESTABLISH OUR ONLINE COLLEGE. WITHOUTVOTE YOU BELIEVES THE NEW TRAIL IN HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE VIENEN RELIC EDUCATIONAL TRAINING FOR CALIFORNIANS WORKING IN LOW WAGE JOBS WITH LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCED. THE CALL WAS A RESPONSE TO RAPIDLY. ECONOMY THAT IS LEFT TO CALIFORNIANS BEHIND PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME WORKERS OF COLOR. THE ONLINE COLLEGE WAS GIVEN A UNIQUE MANDATE- AND IT'S DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ADULTS WHOSE WORK AND FAMILY OBLIGATIONS PREVENT THEM FROM ATTENDING A BRICK AND MORTAR INSTITUTION ON A REGULAR ACADEMIC CALENDAR. I CALIBRATE THESE WORKERS CAN OBTAIN THE EDUCATIONAL TRAINING THEY NEED TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER AT A TIME AND PLACE OF THEIR CHOOSING. THE METHOD FOR FILLING THE MISSION IS ONLINE COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION A CHANCE OR JUST DESCRIBED. IT ENABLES STUDENTS TO WORK AT THEIR OWN PACE AND LEARN SKILLS TO QUALIFY THEM FOR HIGHER LEVEL JOBS. IMPORTANTLY CALVARY WAS ALSO DESIGNED TO OFFER A LOW COST PUBLIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WHICH PROVIDE INFERIOR EDUCATION AT PRICES THAT LEAVE MANY STUDENTS DEEP IN DEBT. WE'RE STILL IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT INSTITUTION CALIBRATE COLLEGES ANNOUNCED TO THE PUBLIC ONLY LAST MAY AND BEGAN ACCEPTING APPLICANTS FOR ADMISSION IN OCTOBER. MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS HAVE ENROLLED NOW AND ARE TAKING COURSE WORK IN THE AREAS OF CYBERSECURITY MEDICAL CODING AND IT SUPPORT. THIS PILOT GROUP WILL HELP US TO IMPROVE OUR CURRICULUM IN STUDENT SERVICES AND THE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE WE EXPAND MORE BROADLY THIS SUMMER. BECAUSE WE ARE AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE IN OUR DEVELOPMENT THE INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE TO YOU TODAY IS VERY PRELIMINARY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR WORK. AT A AT THIS HEARING IN WELCOME INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP US IMPROVE OUR SERVICES AND FULFILL OUR MISSION. FINALLY I WANT TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR LEADERSHIP TRANSITION. AS YOU KNOW OUR FIRST CEO RESIGNED LAST MONTH. WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME A NEW INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE A G. TO TELL WALKER MANON WHO WILL START IN TWO WEEKS MS MEN. BEARING CAN. SHOW HER CITIES ASSOCIATES. MISS MEN AND LET THE ADVANCE TEAM THAT IMPLEMENTED THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED CALIBRATE AND IS DEEP COMMISSION COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION OF THE INSTITUTION. SHE SERVED AS A KEY HIGHER EDUCATION ADVISER IN THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE IN THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AS WELL AS ROLES IN CONGRESS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP STUDENTS ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION GOALS. AS INTERIM CEO SHE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION YOU NEED FOR EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF COUNT RIGHT. AND BEFORE I CONCLUDE- I WAS GIVEN A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS VERY QUICKLY- WHERE I WITH US FOR AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS IN IN MEETING THE START UP MILESTONES IN- WE HAVE MET IN IN A REPORT THAT WE SENT TO YOU- LAST YEAR- MATTER STATUTORY. OUT MILESTONES AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARD THE ACCREDITATION UNDER THE DISTRICT. AT THE DISTANCE EDUCATION ACCREDITING COMMISSION AND WE WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO SUBMIT- TO DO TO THIS ORGANIZATION DEAC NO LATER THAN OCTOBER IN TWENTY TWENTY. I WAS ALSO AS FOR AN UPDATE ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT- PROGRAM OFFERINGS IN PROJECTIONS WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN ENROLLEES NOW. IN THE THREE PROGRAM PATHWAYS AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE OUR FIRST GRADUATES. COMPLETE THE CURRICULUM BY LATE SPRING. AND IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIAL REPORTING- WE BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN VERY CAREFUL STEWARDS OF THE MONEY- THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN SO FAR A- SINCE IT. LAUNCHED ITS A TOTAL OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SPENT- THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AT THE LA- INDICATED WAS FOR CAPITAL EXPENSES HAS NOT BEEN SPENT THAT'S JUST WHAT'S BEEN BUDGETED- WE INTEND AND HAVE BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING TRANSPARENT. AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU EVER NEED AND WE ALSO DID HAVE AN INTERNAL AUDIT WHICH FOUND WHICH GIVE US CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH- FOR THE FIRST. SIX MONTHS OF THE ORGANIZATION. AND FINALLY WAS ASKED TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON- ON WORK WITH EMPLOYERS AND LABOR IS TO ME WORKFORCE MAN'S- WE ARE WORKING WITH WITH MANY DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS AND HAVE DONE OUT REACH TO OVER A HUNDRED OVER THE LAST- MANY MONTHS- WE HAVE LETTERS- IN THE RECORD TODAY- ROM. SALES FORCE AND KELLY SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY INDICATING THEIR INTEREST IN WORKING WITH US TO PLACE- CALIBRATE STUDENTS IN THEIR JOBS. AND WE'VE ALSO HAD SUPPORT FROM THE LA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE BAY AREA COUNCILS. AS SO BAD THANK YOU. LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. CALLING I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT RATHER THAN HAVE ME START LET ME- DEFER TO YOU FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. LET ME. LET ME START AND I'M SURE THEY'LL JUMP IN. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SPEAKER FOR ABOUT A TIME UNDER THE DOME HERE CRITICIZING THE FOR PROFIT EDUCATIONAL INDUSTRY BOTH FOR THE COST OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND FOR THEIR- CURRENT LACK OF- OR FILL YOU TO TIE PROGRAMS TO ACTUAL JOBS FOR GRADUATES AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S A DISCUSSION CERTAINLY THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING ON THE NATIONAL. STAGE AS WELL SOME OF THE FOR PROFITS AND OTHERS THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX S FOR EXAMPLE CERTAINLY SERVE MORE THAN COMPETENCY BASED. PROGRAMS ON THEIR PLATE ON ITS PLATE. BACHELOR'S DEGREES MASTER'S DEGREES AND OTHERS- ARE IN A CONCEPT THAT SHEDS BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES FOR THE MOST PART. FOR A FLEXIBILITY AND ALL OF THE REST. THAT'S PROBABLY A SUBJECT THAT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND WE CAN PROBABLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I'M SURE. THE DEBATE WILL BE FIERCE IF WE EVER STARTED BUT THE REAL ISSUE HERE IT SEEMS TO ME IS WHETHER THIS PRODUCT IS NEEDED. AND IF SO HOW BEST TO DELIVER IT AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET INTO THE DUPLICATION CONVERSATION. SINCE I WAS NOT HERE IN TWENTY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHO AND I INDICATED I'D LIKE TO SORT OF HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS PROGRAM HOWEVER SHORT. LET ME JUST ASK A FEW QUESTIONS I'VE READ. THE MILESTONE REPORT THE RECENT ONE FROM CALIBRATED. AND NOTED THE EFFORT TO- ENGAGE EXCITE AND EDUCATE I THINK THE THREE EASE THAT YOU ALL USE. THE EIGHT MILLION STRANDED WORKERS IN THE STATE. AND THEN WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT THE- BUDGET COMMITTEES ANALYSIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. I NOTED THAT- THERE WAS SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE INADEQUATELY SERVING THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR WHO WERE IN THE WORK FORCE BUT LACK A POST SECONDARY. DEGREE OR CREDENTIAL AND PRESUMABLY THAT WAS THE ONE OF THE PREMISES THAT MY PREDECESSORS- CONSIDERED WHEN THOROUGHLY EVALUATING THIS PROPOSAL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO MY QUESTION I WAS THROUGH THE QUESTIONS THEY DID TEACH ME HOW TO ASK THEM ART THERE WERE THERE ANY SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THE PREMISE THAT WE HAVE EIGHT MILLION STRANDED WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TALK ABOUT STUDIES. AND IT'S EIGHT MILLION ONE PLACE IT'S A POINT FIVE MILLION ANOTHER BUT WHAT I HAVE WHAT I DID NOT NOTICE IN ANY OF THE MATERIAL THAT I READ IN PREPARING FOR THIS. ANY CITATION TO A SPECIFIC STUDY DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ONE. WAS ANY TAKERS. SO SURE RAFI THERE WERE IS. A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND- WHAT DO WE MEAN BY STRANDED WORKERS AND HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS- SO. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE RELIED ON DIRECTLY WAS- BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANALYSIS ON WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ET DE DATA- AS WELL AS INFORMATION THAT COMES DOOR YOU KNOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND OTHERS WHO ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF. DEGREE ATTAINMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WORKERS AND THEIR WAGES- THE WAGES OF WORKERS THAT- BOTH WORKERS AND HAVE HAD POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION CREDENTIALS AND WAGES THAT HAVE NOT SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE NOT ONLY STUDIES BUT DATA THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM FEDERAL AND STATE SOURCES THAT'S WHAT WE RELIED ON THAT'S WHAT WE PROVIDED- THE LEGISLATURE- THERE ARE THERE ARE STUDIES- BOTH FROM- GEORGETOWN- DOCTRINE KERN VOLLEY DOES A LOT OF. WORK THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TWO NINE LOOK AT THE MACHINE OF STRIP IT WORK ARTS OR ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE CALL THIS- DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENTLY. BUT CALIFORNIA HAS A LAW WHICH IS SEGMENT IN WORK. WORK GROUPS THAT. COLLEGE CREDENTIALS IS THIS THE WAY THE COMMUNITY CALL THIS TO TRY CAPTURE THOSE WORK SO THEY WE CAN CERTAINLY PER YOU WITH A LOT OF THAT IN BE HAPPY TO PROVIDED TO STAFF BUT- AS YOU MENTIONED DEPENDING ON WHICH REPORT YOU READ IT HAS DIFFERENT- NUMBERS OF WORKERS BUT IT'S ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT MILLION WHICH IS A LOT KNOW HOW YOU LOOK AT IT MY COULD EARN. BOTH THERE IS. THE US THE PRO OF FOR DATA AND THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR EDT DATA. IS VERY GENERAL NONSPECIFIC. OVERALL AND CERTAINLY DRAMATICALLY NONSPECIFIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE BREAK DOWN OF CALIFORNIA AND THE VARIOUS REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HELPFUL THAT DATE IS WHEN MAKING A STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE STRANDED WORKERS BECAUSE- THAT STATEMENT. SUGGESTS THAT YOU HAVE WORKERS WHO IN SOME CASES WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU HAVE SUGGESTS THAT YOU HAVE WORKERS WHO WERE IN REGIONS THAT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. GIVEN THE DISH EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BUILT IN THERE THAT I THAT'S WHY I ASK IF THERE WAS A SPECIFIC STUDY. TAILORED TO CALIFORNIA AND IN PARTICULAR TO- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONLINE EDUCATION AND BRICK AND MORTAR EDUCATION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPETENCY BASED DIRECT ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS AND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY OFFER IN OUR C. ISSUE YOU SEE AND- MORE PARTICULARLY. ARE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SO THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS NOT A MORE SPECIFIC STUDY THAT RELY ON. AND THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION HAVE THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES. THE DOCUMENT. IN I'M CREED WAY ARE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES AND IN PARTICULAR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE INADEQUATELY SERVING. ANY PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHIC CAN OUR POPULATION BASE AND IN PARTICULAR THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION APPARENTLY RELIED ON. IN PUTTING THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION IN PUTTING FORWARD. THIS PROPOSAL. AND YOU ALL SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A TIDY THAT'S CRITICIZING THE VERY VERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THAT YOU SUPERVISE. YES SO THE ANSWER IS YES- AND I WOULD ARGUE TO YOUR PREVIOUS POINT AND WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE SPECIFICALLY. WE ARE CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ENGAGING WITH THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOME ON THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION WHICH IS ALSO LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. SPECIFICALLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WAGE GAIN AND- AVAILABILITY OF COLLEGE CREDENTIALS SO- I THINK- WE HAVE RELIED HEAVILY AND HAVE ARGUED TO THE LEGISLATURE THE CALIFORNIACOMMITTEE COLLEGES NEEDS MORE CAPACITY- BOTH IN TERMS OF ONLINE EDUCATION. COMP THE BEST EDUCATION AND- THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW BRICK AND MORTAR CAPACITY. MOST RECENTLY- THE GOVERNOR'S- POST SECONDARY COUNCIL ON EDUCATION- REVIEWED SEVERAL REPORTS OF FROM MACKENZIE. THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE IN THE CAPACITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO MEET THE DEMAND PARTICULARLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THESE ARE TWO AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE WE LACK CAPACITY FROM BOTH THE PUBLIC. HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR AND THE NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR. IT IS LED TO INITIATIVES LIKE THE FRESNO PROJECT THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY BY BRINGING TOGETHER THE PUBLIC IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. BUT THERE. I AT LEAST I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED. THAT MY SYSTEM. DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE TOOLS NECESSARY. TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF PARTICULARLY OF WORKERS WHO DID NOT GET MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND WHOSE JOBS. I THINK WHETHER YOU'RE READING MACKENZIE PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPER THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE A NUMBER OF THINK TANKS AND OF LOOKED AT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE. THERE IS WHETHER IT'S EIGHT MILLION SIX MILLION OR FOUR MILLION. VULNERABLE TO THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING. WITH A AYE AND AUTOMATION IN THE WORK FORCE SO THAT'S- THAT WAS THE IMPETUS SO- HAS THERE BEEN ONE COMPREHENSIVE STUDY DONE JUST ON THIS QUESTION- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT IS BEING DONE. TOLD BRING ALL THE STUDIES TOGETHER TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE- AND IS LED TO A LOT OF CHANGES BOTH THEM OUR SYSTEM TO SEE IF YOU THE UC AS WELL AS- CHANGES OF THE GOVERNOR IS CONSIDERING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WELL I HAVE MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS AND I HOPE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THOSE BUT LET ME JUST ASK MORE OVER ARCH QUESTION. HERE BECAUSE I THINK GHOST PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE CONVERSATION. ALL THE TO AT. BACK TO HAVE THIS WORK FOR PROGRAM WE FIND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS ONE COMPONENT OF WITH CONSORTIUM IS ONE COMPONENT OF TRYING TO BRING FOLKS FROM HIGH SCHOOL INTO IT WAS CERTIFICATES AND THEN THE DIFFERENT JOBS AND WE FUND AT IT I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR SO IS A RECALL WE HAVE ANOTHER ADULT SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT IS A K. TO TWELVE CONCERTS YEAR REIGN AS WELL AND THERE'S THE TENSION BETWEEN THE- OF THOSE. WE HAVE OTHER. T. E. EFFORTS THE FUNDED TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. PLUS YOU HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE HERE THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. IN A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IF THAT'S ACCURATE ENROLLED IN THOSE. AND YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF ONLINE PROGRAMS OR THOUSANDS DEPENDING ON WHICH TO STICK YOU PICK. ONE AND WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TWO FOR EXAMPLE. TELL ONE OR MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALL OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER. TO TAKE A CERTAIN PORTION OF THEIR EFFORT IF WE HAVE TO TAKE A PORTION OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION TAKE A PORTION OF THAT. AND MOVE AWAY FROM- TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM MODELED INSTRUCTION TO IF THE CURRENT VIEW IS WE WANT MORE COMPETENCY BASED DIRECT ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS. WITH FLEXIBLE. START AND STOP TIMES AND NOT. TETHERED TO PARTICULAR ACADEMIC TERMS TELL ONE OR MORE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALL OF THEM TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION 410% OF THEIR OFFERINGS ARE 20% OR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVE THAT'S BEEN OUTLINED FOR CALIBRATED ASSUMING IT'S A VALID OBJECTIVE ASSUMING WE HAVE STRANDED WORKERS ASSUMING WERE INADEQUATELY SERVING A PORTION. OF OUR POPULATION IS- FOR QUESTION. HOW ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IT WAS A IT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED TO BEGIN WITH. THIS QUESTION WHY WOULD WE NEED ANOTHER COLLEGE NOW. IT'S A BIG THE QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE A HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES TO BEGIN WITH I MEAN THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO GROW UP IN CALIFORNIA. SO YES THIS QUESTION. IS THERE ANY NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF CASSIDY IS A BALLOT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. QUESTION CAN. ASK&lt;/c&gt;</u> BY THIS BY. I WILL. THAT TO UP I'M- JUSTICE. WAY ME TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THAT I GREW UP IN THE COASTER BECAUSE SYSTEM I WENT TO GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE THE COST ME COLLEGE DISTRICT HAS THREE COLLEGES ONE OF WHICH IS FULLY ONLINE- IT WAS DEVELOPED TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF ONLINE INSTRUCTION SO THE CORE CAPACITY FOR COASTAL IN COLLEGES ONLY TO DO ONLINE EDUCATION. THE CHALLENGE FOR US WHY MARLIN FOR OTHER COLLEGES IS AT OUR COLLEGES ALREADY. RECEIVE LESS THAN NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT THE ALREADY ASKED. TO SERVE MULTIPLE MISSIONS INCLUDING IN- ESL INCLUDING- INCARCERATED FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH WE CONTINUE TO ASK OUR COLLEGES TO DO MORE AND MORE. IT WAS- OUR ARGUMENT THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A COLLEGE JUST TO SERVE ONE POPULATION AND THEN TO DISSEMINATE THAT LEARNING TO ALL OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN CALL JUST SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD CAPACITY. IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU USE THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE THE ONLINE EDUCATION IN THIS GOAL. IS TO DEVELOP A- A CORPSE EXCHANGE FOR ON. EDUCATION SO THE ANY STUDENT IN THE STATE CAN TAKE AN ONLINE COURSE AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE TAKEN INTO PROBE A STUDY. IT'S BEEN ALL FIVE YEARS WE STILL HAVE NOT LEAVE THAT GOAL THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF THE ISLAND. INITIATIVE THAT'S- AN ISSUE THAT WE IN THE SYSTEM ARE CONTINUE TO BE ASKED TO DO SEVERAL THINGS AT ONCE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS FIFTY HIM AS MY WRONG FIFTY SEVEN OF YOUR- ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES ARE PART OF THE- ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. FIFTY SEVEN OUR PARTY ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE BUT THERE ARE MUCH LESS COURSES AVAILABLE ON THE COURSE EXCHANGE IN THE IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE STILL ARE CHALLENGED BY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO SHARE- F. T. HOW TO SHARE THE EXPENSE THE REVENUE ACROSS THE COLLEGE THEN WE WILL GET THERE. BUT BUT THE OTHER THING I WOULD WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THESE ARE CONTINUE TO BE TREATED NO CORPUS. I WOULD STILL OPEN THE SUN ESTHER MY- THERE'S SICK TIME. AND WHILE IMPORTANT WE TO GO BECAUSE- WE HAVE OUR COMPETITORS CONTINUE TO GROW THEIR CAPACITY- IN MY MIND THIS IS NOT AN EITHER OR SITUATION WE NEED BOTH. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS OUR COLLEGES TO WORK IN REGIONS. TO WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE TO TRY AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FOR REGIONAL WORKFORCE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REACH MORE STUDENTS THROUGH THINGS LIKE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF C. B. E. WE ARE PREPARING REGULATIONS TO GO TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THAT WOULD ALLOW ALL OF FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES IF THEY CHOOSE TO OFFER C. B. E. IN MY MIND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. ALL OF LEVELS OF CAPACITY IN ORDER TO SERVE THE NEEDS GROWING NEEDS OF OUR WORKFORCE. WELL ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD TO DO TRACK THIS THING AND- TRACKS WITH. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AS I RECALL BUT YOU COULD THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPER. NINETY ONE TIME TO IMPROVE ONLINE YES EDUCATION THROUGH ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. AND CAN LOOK THAT. BUDGET TERM. INITIATIVE I GUESS FOR THE ADMIN. MINUS THAT THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO- LEAD THIS THESE ARE THE WORDS LEAD TO SHORT TERM INDUSTRY VALUED CERTIFICATES OR CREDENTIALS ARE PROGRAMS. FOR ENABLE STUDENT IN A PATHWAY TO CONTINUE IN THE PATHWAY. IN A PATHWAY OFFERED BY AN EXISTING COLLEGE WAS CERTAINLY THE FIRST ONE IS EXACTLY THE CAL BRIGHT MODEL ISN'T IT SHORT TERM INTO SHOCK VALUE TOO DIFFICULT CREDENTIALS ARE PROGRAMS. AND IF SO IF THAT DOESN'T DIFFER FROM CAP BRIDES IT'D MISSION. WHAT ARE WE DOING. SO SENATOR I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT THE SAME AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS. SOMETIMES A DIFFICULT DISTINCTION BECAUSE WE ARE SO USE TO THE MODEL OF EDUCATION THAT WE ALL PARTICIPATED IN. THAT WE ALL HAD THE BENEFIT OF GOING TO A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WHETHER ONLINE OR BRICK AND MORTAR AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO PURSUE AN EDUCATION. THAT REQUIRED SEVERAL SEMESTERS TO GET THROUGH. AND EVEN IN THE SHORT TERM CERTIFICATE MODEL IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE STILL ASKING. OUR STUDENTS. TO GO THROUGH A SERIES OF COURSES OVER A SERIES A LENGTH OF TIME TO ACCOMPLISH AND ACHIEVE A CERTIFICATE THAT ROOM. IMPORTANT CREDENTIAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE LOWER LEVEL OF CREDENTIALING A LEVEL CREDENTIALING THAT WE HAVE NOT STATE BEEN DOING A LEVEL OF CREDENTIALS AND THAT IS CHARTER TO WE- WORK. WHO WERE WERE TO WITH. THAT'S THE TYPE OF CREDENTIAL IN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO. DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND ATTEND ONE OF OUR COLLEGES SO THIS WILL MAKE US MORE FLEXIBLE NOT LESS FLEXIBLE. TO MORE CALIFORNIANS BELLE ISLE NOTE ON THIS. ATTACHED TO THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT INITIATIVE IT OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES SEVENTY QUALIFYING PROJECTS WERE FUNDED OUT OF A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS DESIGNED TO CREATE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN NEW OR IMPROVED FULLY ONLINE PROGRAMS LEADING THE HIGHER WAGE EMPLOYMENT. I REALIZE THIS ISN'T YOU AND THIS IS WASN'T YOUR INITIATIVE I DON'T THINK BUT SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE LOOKING AT THIS WOULD PROBABLY THINK WE AREN'T VERY WELL ORGANIZED. IN THIS STATE IS JUST AN OBSERVATION AND I WOULD MAKE LET ME MOVE% TO. EMPLOYERS AND IT SEEMS TO ME BASED ON WHAT'S BEEN SAID AND CERTAINLY WHAT I'VE READ THAT THE LYNCH PIN IN THIS PROCESS IS THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY AND I FRANKLY Q. HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OUR- CUSTOMERS ARE EMPLOYERS OR OUR CUSTOMERS OUR STUDENTS AT THIS POINT AND I'LL- I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS TO GO TO THAT IN A MINUTE BUT- WHAT. WHAT NEEDS BASED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AROUND THIS STATE OF HIM OF EMPLOYERS NOW. TO DETERMINE THE NEED FOR A COMMUNITY BASED- TRAINING PROGRAM. THE ONE WE'VE EMBARKED ON TO INITIATING THIS EFFORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OTHER WORDS WHAT EMPLOYERS WORK OR STUDY INDEPENDENTLY. AND WHO STUCK THEIR HAND UP AND SAID LET ME SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE I NEED THIS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY THAT. PROBABLY IS MORE TRAINING INTENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER AND IT'S JUST WEST OF HERE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THAT INDUSTRY HAS OR HAS OUR OWN AND HAS THEIR OWN INTERNAL TRAINING PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S COOL OR WHATEVER- INTUITIVE COULD PROGRAMS THAT THEY OFFER BOTH FOR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES AND OTHER- PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT. CENTER FOR QUESTION YES NO ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IF YOU PICK UP THE PAPER ANY DAY OF THE WEEK YOU SEE ONE MORE EMPLOYER ONE MORE LARGE EMPLOYER WHETHER IT'S DISNEY WALMART- DISCOVERED CHIPOTLE ALL INVESTING IN EMPLOYER LED TRAINING PROGRAM. FOR THEIR WORK FORCE SO I THINK ONE THAT SPEAKS TO THE TREMENDOUS DEMAND TO THAT SPEAKS TO. THE LUCK OF CAPACITY EMPLOYERS HE AND I PUBLIX. OF OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T BE IN IN THE OWN PROGRAM SO WOULD RATHER SEE THE INVEST IN OUR PROGRAMS I WOULD RATHER SEE THEM INVEST THAT MONEY IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEMS- NOW SO WHICH EMPLOYERS SHOULD WE TALKED WE TALKED TO- IT IS A LARGE LIST OF EMPLOYERS INCLUDING EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. THE TO THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP TO THE LA CHAMBER SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO. MANY MANY MANY EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT WE HAVE MET WITH THEY CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND CONTINUE TO RAISE YOUR HAND AND SAY YES WE WANT THIS INCLUDING LARGE EMPLOYERS LIKE YOU HAVE- LETTERS FROM SALES FORCE WE HAVE- IN WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM- HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE KAISER DIGNITY HEALTH SUTTER. AND OTHERS. AND AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION HERE IS THAT WE ARE NOT JUST FOCUS ON EMPLOYERS. WE ARE NOT- GIVING EMPLOYERS MORE OF A HAND IN THIS DESIGN. THEN WE ARE WORKERS IT IS AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO AND WORK WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS WHO SEE THIS AS A CRITICAL ISSUE. WHETHER WE'RE TALKING TO- AS YEAH YOU YOU H. W. S. YEAH YOU IN GENERAL- CSEA OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT SEE THE NEED NOW THERE IS A CHALLENGE WITH EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE OF EMPLOYERS DO NOT FEEL THAT CAL BRIDE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS DIFFICULT TO LAND. A FIRM PARTNERSHIP. BUT NONE THE LESS THERE ARE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE. HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING CONTINUE TO BE DEVELOPED THE THREE PATHWAYS THAT WERE DETERMINED- WHEN WE CAME BEFORE YOU THE FIRST TIME THE THREE PATHWAYS ARE DETERMINED. BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYER DEMAND AND BECAUSE OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATION DEMAND THAT'S HOW THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE- SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO ROUTE. I SAY WIKI IS BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOES THIS IS IN OUR DNA EXPECT CALIBRATED TO THE SECOND THING. IS LEVEL OF CREDENTIALS AS WE ASK MUST TURN YOUR COLLEGE WITH. US AND YOU ME BECAUSE THIS MARK MY FORMER COLLEGE BEACH COLLEGE WE SEE THIS ADDING TO PASSIVELY WELL I HAVE SOME WORK. ON THIS PARTICULAR EMPLOYER ISSUE WHEN AND THE MAN BUT I. SENATOR UP IT'S GOING ME A XO UNDER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR OF YEAH. I WOULD GO BACK TO ALLOW BIT THE ISSUE OF. TARGET OF WORKERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE ON THE UNDERSERVED- CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCES ABOUT HALF LATINO. AND THE MEAT THAT PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION UP BUT THE CAL BRIGHT OF COLLEGE ENROLLMENT SO FAR- IS LESS THAN THIS MAN THE LATINO ENROLLMENT IS LESS THAN 20% AND THEN 25% OF ENROLLEES HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO HOW DOES THAT. DR HOW DOES THAT MATCH WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MISSION OF CAL BRIGHT. I MEAN LET ME TAKE THEM IN FOR- FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW THIS IS A PILOT- COVERT IT'S THE FIRST WAVE OF PEOPLE BUT ALSO THERE IS- IMPORTANTLY THERE WAS A AN ERROR IN THE CALCULATION ORIGINALLY THAT. THE PERCENT OF- LENNIX- ENROLLEES IS OVER AND- WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING THAT ACCURATELY AT THE BEGINNING- BUT THE- IN TERMS OF THE 25% BEING- HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WE'VE HEARD SOME. SO TALK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHO HAVE. SIGNED UP FOR CALIBRATED TO SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND WE THINK THAT MAY HAVE- PERHAPS THROWN OFF THE- THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF THIS OF THIS INITIAL COHORT. WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT- THAT'S JUST- THINGS THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD. BUT YOU KNOW OUR OUR- OUR INTENT AS WE AS WE MARKET MORE BROADLY AND- AND GROW THAT THAT WE- WE WERE. COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT WE WILL HAVE A- YOU KNOW BE REACHING THE TARGET AUDIENCE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. PROGRAMS IN PLACE BOTH BOTH JUST- DIRECTED. OUT REACH TO TWO GROUPS THAT WORK CLOSELY WITH THOSE POPULATIONS AS WELL AS- AS A TARGETED ONLINE- MARKETING- PLAN THAT THAT WE THINK WILL REACH THEM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN WAIT. THE PAPER SEE THE OUR MISSION SO WITHIN THAT WILL WILL CHANGE OVER TIME IN I CAN'T REPEAT ENOUGH THAT THIS I MEAN WHICH LAUNCHED A FEW MONTHS AFTER UNITED AFTER GETTING THE AFTER EVEN AND ANNOUNCING IN NAME IN THAT. SO THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO TO- TO ENHANCE OUR VISIBILITY- IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT TO REACH AND THAT WE ARE DEDICATED TO DOING THAT SO- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE THAT CAO BREAKS OUR RECRUITMENT PLANS ARE NOT. POACHING THE STUDENT. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE UTILIZE THE ONLINE. US EIGHTY UP PROGRAM OFFERED BY COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THE AT THE INSTRUCTION THAT WE'RE OFFERING IS VERY DIFFERENT IN IN BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE IT'S- AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT- YOU CAN START AND STOP WHENEVER YOU WANT- YOU PROGRESS AT YOUR OWN PACE. AND IN ITS- IS OFFERING IT IS NOT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR DEGREES AS MOST PEOPLE WHO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. TO BUILD CREDITS TOWARD A DEGREE THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS IS FOR THIS IS. TO OBTAIN JOB SKILLS TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER FROM FROM WHERE YOU ARE SO- IT IT'S A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY THEN AND THEN OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE USING AND I DO WANT TO ADD THAT. WE THINK THIS WILL IN THE LONG RUN BENEFIT ALL THE- COLLEGES BECAUSE WE'RE- A VEHICLE FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND LEARNING HOW TO DO. WHAT AND AS WITH THAT WE CAN SHARE THAT- THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH. THE BASE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND WE ALL WILL SHARE- ALSO IN OUR IN OUR OUT REACH TO EMPLOYERS FOR INSTANCE- WITH WE FIND AN EMPLOYER HAS GREAT NEEDS IN CALIBRATING TO START WITH A VERY SMALL. STUDENT POPULATION YOU CAN PUT IN. A STEEP TO BE TRYING TO GET OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO TAKE THE JOBS THAT THAT WITH THE STATEWIDE EMPLOYERS THAT WERE- THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH. IF I CAN ADD SENATOR I'D I THINK. YOU KNOW A AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONWHO WHO IS CAL BRIGHT TARGETING RESEARCH WHO IS. OUR OUR TRADITIONAL COMMITTEE CALLED IS TARGETING. AND I THINK- THAT CERTAINLY OUR EXPECTATION CHANGES OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD BE TARGETING. THEY SHOULD BE WORKING WITH AND I THINK THE MORE- LABOR PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE CREATED WITH CALIBRATED THINK THE MORE THAT YOU'LL SEE THAT TARGET CONTINUE TO. BE REFINED- I ALSO THINK. THAT YOU KNOW. WE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO WE CANNOT DENY ENROLLMENT. TO ANY COLLEGE I MEAN YOU'RE- FROM- THE GREAT CITY OF SAN ANGELES WE HAVE. PROBABLY OUR TALKING HERE THREE COLLEGES AROUND OR ARE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- WE FEEL THAT. THE COLLEGES IN LAS CHANGES WORK WELL TOGETHER. TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYER EVEN THOUGH STUDENTS MOVE. CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH ALL THE COLLEGES WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO SANTA MONICA COLLEGE LACC- REAL HONDA WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING. AND IS WHY WE EXPECT CAL RIGHT TO FORM. ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS CABARETS ALREADY FORMED A MEMORANDUM BUT AND UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SOUTH ORANGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. IT'S EXPLORING A PARTNERSHIP WITH SEVERAL OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND THAT THAT'S THE EXPECTATION WE HAVE ALL OVER COLLEGES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE. THAT WERE HANDED OUT STUDENTS OF BELONG IN OTHER PROGRAMS I LIKE WHAT THE CAN AND OFF THE COP RIGHT SO SAID ARE BETTER. STRUCTURE GOING UP. AND JUST ENTER OF THE EMPLOYER. I MEAN WITHIN A FEW YEARS- YOU PROJECTED YOU WILL HAVE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND- STUDENTS- AND BECAUSE OF YOUR MISSION OF THOSE STUDENTS WILL BE PUT IN SOME SORT OF A JOB IT WILL LEAD TO SOME SORT OF A JOB OF PAID YOU KNOW WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS. HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET FROM WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW WHERE YOU HAVE NONE. TO THAT LEVEL IF THAT'S THE PROMISE THAT YOU'RE MAKING. OF BOTH TO US AND TO THE PUBLIC AND TO- PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR CAREER BY THE WAY I HOPE NOT. DON'T SEE THIS AS A CAREER AT END UP IN WALMART I DON'T SEE THAT AS A CAREER. BUT YOU KNOW A REAL CAREER. WELL ED DO YOU KNOW WE HAVE JUST STARTED WE LITERALLY- DIDN'T EVEN START ACCEPTING- STUDENTS UNTIL OCTOBER FIRST- WE ARE- TESTING A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND NEW COURSES AND- AND ALSO EXPERIMENTING WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES TUTORING COUNSELLING- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ONLINE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THAT- AND WE EXPECT TO LEARN QUITE A BIT THAT'S GOING TO ENABLE US TO. YOU TO BE- MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE- WHEN WE BRING IN OUR NEXT WAVE OF STUDENTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT- THAT IF WE GET IT RIGHT THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT- THAT MANY- STUDENTS INTO INTO THESE AND OTHER COURSES THAT WOULD BE ADDING- NEXT YEAR. AND THAT- AS EMPLOYERS SEE THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC IN A WELL MAINTAINED WELL MAINTAINED WELL CREDENTIALED ORGANIZATION THAT THAT THEY'LL WANT TO PARTNER WITH US WE THINK WE'VE MADE SOME REAL PROGRESS- WE HAVE A TEAM THAT'S OUT THERE TALKING. I'VE TALKED OVER A HUNDRED EMPLOYERS SO FAR. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO- TO- CREATE PARTNERSHIPS OF THEM OR WEAKENED WHERE THEY CAN DO- OUR OUR STUDENTS AS THEY FINISH THEIR- CREDENTIALS CAN DO- IT CAN DO ON THE JOB TRAINING. AND THEN ULTIMATELY LEADING INTO INTO FULL TIME JOBS I MEAN WE'VE GOT OBVIOUSLY SOME SOME MORE THINGS TO DO BUT BUT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THAT WE'RE JUST IN THE VERY VERY EARLY STAGES OF THIS I MEAN LITERALLY I MEAN TO GET A- A- A WHOLE NEW ENTERPRISE UP AND RUNNING FROM. YOU KNOW FROM YOU KNOW IN SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS IS IT IS REALLY A BIG CHALLENGE BUT IT BUT WE'RE PLEASED THAT WE'VE GOT. WE'RE LEARNING FROM THEM AND- AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY OBTAIN. THE ULTIMATE EMPLOYMENT THE END OF THE ROAD THAT THEY'VE BEEN- THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR. YEAH I JUST FINALLY- ON THE ON THE ISSUE THAT I'VE I KNOW WITH. SENATOR ROTH IS ALREADY KIND OF ALREADY PRETTY MUCH **** BUT- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATE ENTITY. A I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL MODEL- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF. A CERTIFICATE AND THEN THE DEGREES. BUT WHY IT HAS TO BE A SEPARATE ENTITY- THAT PART I DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MADE FOR WORKING PEOPLE. THEY ARE MADE FOR MEN AND WOMEN YOUNGER OLDER DOESN'T MATTER- I CAN BE IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WHO THEY ARE. YOU ASK HIM. DID YOU EVER TAKE COMMITTEE COLLEGE COURSE SOME OF THEM. GRADUATED WITH A DEGREEMOST OF THEM DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY USED IT TO ENHANCE THEIR SKILL. SO I'VE ALWAYS SAYING. COMEY CALLED AS A REAL SWORD CALLED BY COLOR BUT REAL WORKINGCLASS. AT BASICALLY BECAUSE- IT'S SO CHEAPER. THAN THAN THE YOU KNOW FOUR YEAR. ON ALL CALL. SO OF. I DON'T ICE. DO GET. WHY THERE HAVE TO BE. AN T. I'M SURE WHAT. COLLEGES AN UNCERTAIN RULES THAT THIS KIND OF LIKE THE A CHARTER SCHOOL YOU KNOW AND WE DIDN'T ASK AND EXPECT ON IN THAT WHOLE DEBATE OUT WE USED IT TO SAY HEY LET'S BE INNOVATIVE. CELLS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO DO LET'S BE INNOVATIVE LET'S FIND A DIFFERENT WAY REACHING ARE WORKING CLASS ON COMMUNITIES WHICH I THINK IS GREAT I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU EVEN BROUGHT THAT UP. BUT OF THE DOESN'T YET TO ME JUSTIFY HAVING A SEPARATE ENTITY- AND A SEPARATE GOVERNING A SYSTEM OF IT'S JUST NOT. CLICKING UP AND I KNOW THAT YOU JUST STARTED BUT THIS IS A COMMITMENT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE COMMITMENTS THAT YOU MADE- AND IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR YET FOR EXAMPLE HI GOING TO GET ALL THOSE EMPLOYERS WELL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP FRONT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE INITIAL DEAL UP FRONT BUT- IT MAYBE YOU COULD JUST ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. I'M NOT. YES NO NO I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS SENATOR PARTICULARLY. YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY THE WORD USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE TO YOU- IN TERMS OF A CHARTER LET ME BE VERY CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT WE ARE IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM INTERESTED IN CREATING A CHARTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS ENTITY WAS CREATED SPECIFICALLY IN THIS WAY SO THAT IT WOULD BE. EXACTLY LIKE- ONE OF OUR OTHER SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. SUBJECT TO- ENSURING THAT OUREMPLOYEES ARE REPRESENTED. SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES UNDER TITLE FIVE IN THE EDUCATION CODE AND THIS WAS IN AND I TAKE THIS VERY PERSONALLY BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING A COMMITMENT I MADE PERSONALLY TO OUR LABOR PARTNERS CTA C. F. T. S. C. R. U. C. S. C. A. ON ON DOWN THE LINE. I MADE VERY CLEAR AND I THINK GOVERNOR BROWN AND CERTAINLY GOVERNOR NEWSOME ALL ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A CHARTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT IS A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE ABSOLUTELY. THE REASON WE FELT IT NEEDED TO BE A SEPARATE ENTITIES BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO NEED TO ESTABLISH A NEW BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENT THAT HAS VERY DIFFERENT. WHY ROLES IN. ROLES IT WILL SET A BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO DO THIS IN IN OTHER DISTRICTS IT WILL SET- GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY. TO QUICKLY- DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN BE EASILY SHARED WITH OTHER COLLEGES THAT IS THE INTENT IN AND IF THAT INTENT HAS NOT BEEN MADE CLEAR. IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IS FROM THE INTENT THAT WE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE EXPECT. TO CALIBRATE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL WHILE IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WELL IT WILL DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND- OF MORE CALIFORNIANS. WE EXPECTED TO ACT LIKE A CAT. WHICH IN I COULD ADD JUST A COUPLE THINGS IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. TO YOU KNOW WHEN WRITTEN IN THE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A- ENTITY IS BECAUSE IT IS. THE GOING STATE. AND THE OTHER- COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE DISTRICTS THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY OF BOUNDARIES AND THIS IS THIS IS INTO THIS ENABLES US TO- INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH STATEWIDE EMPLOYERS AND AS A AS I SAID EARLIER WE- WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO. IF WE IDENTIFY EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR WORKERS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES THATARE TRAINING WORKERS OF SIMILAR SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE THOSE JOBS. AND ALSO IN TERMS OF COMPETING FOR STUDENTS WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TRACKING. STUDENTS THAT MIGHT THAT COULDN'T WOULDN'T FIND THEIR WAY TO A REGULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE A BRICK AND MORTAR COLLEGE IN THAT. IF THEY IF THEY- FIND US IN A AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. GET GET ACCUSTOMED TO GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND TO AND LEARNING AND LEARNING THINGS TO HELP THEM MOVE UP THE LADDER THAT THEY- MIGHT BE INTERESTED. IN GETTING A DEGREE AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE FOR THOSE STUDENTS- INTO A PIPELINE TODAY TO THEIR LOCAL ANY COLLEGE. AND THE LAST REASON IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE SEPARATE IT'S REALLY A VERY FOCUSED- ORGANIZATION. CAN THEY CAN TAKE CHANCES EXPERIMENT LEARN NEW THINGS- AND- AND THEN. AS A MASTER AT THE- THE TECHNIQUES WE CAN SHARE THAT WITH ALL THE OTHER COLLEGES THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM A HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS I SAID I. I OVERSEE BOTH AND I YOU KNOW I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED OUR WHOLE BOARD IS THAT. THE CALVARY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE TO THE WELL BEING ALL THE COULD BECAUSE OF. I BOTH SEMI IT BILL LEARNING THAT BE THE CHIEF WELL IT BY. BEING IN. WHY FIGURE IT. CAN'T MAKE IT IN. A ROW TO COMMUTE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO SAY HER FOR THE PRESS X. DO WHAT FOR UP ON LAST FROM SAN DRAWS FIRST AND THEN I HAVE OTHER AS WELL SO. THIS ISSUE ABOUT THREE A SEPARATE ENTITY AND A AND THE MAY BE A OF WHAT SOME QUESTION LOMA POWERFUL BUT I DO HAVE A- BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED. AND NOW IT'S CONCERNS FOR PASS BUT YOU KNOW GOVERNOR THAT WAY. IS THAT THIS ENTITY THIS NEW COLLEGE WOULD BE DIRECTLY UNDER THE GOVERNANCE OF THE STATE WIDE ME COLLEGE TOWARD. WHICH I PRESUME MAYBE A PRISON WRONG I THOUGHT HAD CERTAINLY ENOUGH WORK TO DO TO OVER SELL TO DO THE GUIDANCE CORNY BETWEEN ALL THE OTHER COMMITTEE COLLEGE WITH THEIR ON THE PEDAL BOARDS AND DISTRICTS. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS AND WE YOU KNOW WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THIS WITHOUT SOME CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP AT CETERA. WHAT PROPORTION OF TIME IS OUR STATE WIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARDS SPENDING ON THIS ONE ENTITY. VERSUS OVERSEEING THE ROOM YOU KNOW OUR ACTION OVERSEEING THE RIGHT WORD BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAL DIFFERENT DISTRICTS BUT- DOING THEIR- WORK TO DATE ALSO BEEN CHARGED TO DO TO COORDINATE BETWEEN ALL THE OTHER ENTITIES- SO. BECAUSE THIS IS DIRECTLY UNDER THE STATEWIDE SO- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE- AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THIS IS. BEING NOW PUT ON THE STATE WHAT HE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE STATE AND NOT JUST ON ONE SPECIFIC COLLEGE. WELL I FEEL THE PAIN OF THIS. BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO CONFESS I'VE SPENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ON ON CALIBRATE- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS- IT YOU KNOW AS A START UP IN AND- WITH THE LEADERSHIP CHANGE IT'S IT HAS. IT HAS BEEN TIME CONSUMING BUT- AND IT FALLS I THINK MUCH MORE ON ME THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER THE BORE WE HAVE FORMED AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE BOARD TO- TO OVERSEE CALIBRATE ON ON A MONTHLY BASIS- THE FULL BOARD DOES MEET EVERY. EVERY TWO MONTHS- I CAN SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY IT HASN'T INTERFERED WITH THE GOVERNANCE. TIME IT MAY BE SPENDING MORE TIME THAN I WANTED TO BUT IN THIS BUT- BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN WITH OUR OUR VICE PRESIDENT WHO'S IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY TO AND WHO AND SHE AND I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME BUT- BUT- WE ARE. YOU KNOW I THINK OF ANYTHING IT'S BEEN HELPFUL FOR ME TO BE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF AN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE. IN AN X. ME UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER COLLEGES ARE ARE ARE ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT AND I'VE ALSO THOUGH IT JUST TO SEE YOU KNOW I'VE- I'VE MADE A REAL EFFORT I'VE BEEN TO. THE COLLEGES I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE STATE I'VE MET WITH ALL THE LEADERSHIP STUDENTS THE FACT TO THE CLASSIFIED STAFF EVERYONE. AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT'S AN OFFICIAL FOR US TO BE. SERVICE MORTGAGE STEVE ONE COLLEGE. ST I'M AYE AYE DON'T ANY OF THE- BIRTH YOU THEY HAVE. LIKE THE IN ANY WAY THE UP THERE A STEWARD OF THE OF ALL THE UNIQUE. WELL FIVE. THAT I APPRECIATE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS. MAYBE I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE BOARD BEING BUSY BEFORE- BUT I. ONLY I'M- ABOUT. THE YEAH ON THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS THE OTHER THING IS YOU KNOW HAVE A RELATIONSHIP BUT THIS ONE COLLEGE STAND OTHER ONE AND HOW THAT MIGHT IF YOUR TO MAKING I THINK IS A YOU KNOW A GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN SO I THINK- SO- SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE FIND OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE- AND I THINK WE TENANTS EQUITY BOND SENATOR. THE NEXT PERSON AND ENDS AND I WOULD CERTAINLY YEAH YOU. TO HAVEYOU RESPOND. SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT. I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO MONITOR- AND BUT I DO HAVE AT HAND BEFORE I STILL HAVE AN ACTUALLY THE MORE I HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS GOING ON. THAT CONCERN IS ACTUALLY GROWN. ABOUT THE BUT YOU SHOULD BETWEEN THE STATEWIDE BOARD AND ONE PARTICULAR COLLEGE VERSES THE REP THEIR REMAINING NOW THE OTHER. PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL SO- TO CHANCELLOR PLEASE I. CUT YOU OFF BUT- IT IS QUITE RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TIME I'LL BE BRIEF- I UNDERSTAND- BUT THE CONCERN YOU'RE DESCRIBING THAT WAS CERTAINLY APPOINTED DISCUSSION WHEN CAL BRIGHT WAS ACTUALLY CREATED. IN STATUTE JETS OR A COUPLE OF THINGS AND- NOT TO DEBATE THE ISSUE BUT JUST TO BRING OUT WHAT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED INITIALLY. WHAT IS. THAT THERE WAS- A REAL DESCRIPTION BETWEEN LEGAL COUNSEL'S BOTH FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. AS WELL AS INTERACTION WITH SOME OF OUR- LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE PREFERRED. THERE WAS DEBATE WHAT WOULD THE MODEL SO THIS. THIS CREATION WAS A COMPRA. THE TIME WITH ALL THE CONSTITUENT GROUPS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST MULLIN A MODEL THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH- ONGOING. THE SECOND IS. NOT UNLIKE THE UC IN THE C. ISSUES BOARDS- OF THEIR **** TO CONTINUOUSLY OVERSEE OTHER ENTITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE UC- THEY OVERSEE THE NATIONAL LABS THEY OVERSEE A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES OR SEPARATELY INCORPORATED- AND IT DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME- SO. THE STRUCTURE IS. ULTIMATELY UNIQUE BUT I DO I DO APPRECIATE. THAT THIS HAS TAKEN A LOT OF TIME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ALSO IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE BOARD OF NURSING HAVE A SEPARATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IT HAS A- TIME. IN OVER. COME TO BECAUSE- THE CITY PURCHASED OKAY BECAUSE. IT PROVIDING TO OVERSIGHT FOR OVER OF THE BROUGHT TO COME BECAUSE- SO IT DOES HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE ANY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING A CONFLICT. FOR THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE OF THE SYSTEM BUT I DO BELIEVE IS A FAIR QUESTION IT AND SOME THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER APPRECIATE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT AT YOU SEE WHICH WERE I WAS FORMALLY FACULTY MEMBER. THE NATIONAL LABS ARE DIFFERENT AND THE INDIVIDUAL EDUCATIONAL CAMPUSES SO YES I GET THAT BUT WHICH SO. I'M NOT SURE. EXACTLY THE SAME THIS IS A DESERT ADDITIONAL EDUCATION INSTITUTION. VERSUS THAT SO THAT'S IN. COMPETITIONS RIGHT WORD BUT CERTAINLY. MAYBE I ATTENTION THE DUPLICATION OF THE OTHER ONES- AS AND WE WON'T REHASH TO DUPLICATE AN ISSUE- THE OTHER THE OTHER SO THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE- SEVEN LISTEN CAREFULLY RAISING WILL WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE COLLEGE. RIGHT AND- SO ONE THAT AT ONE POINT THAT WAS EMPHASIZED QUITE A BIT. WAS AND I MESSAGES FOR THE NEXT PANEL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. IN TWO. WELL THIS THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR OWN. AT SO FORTH YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A TIME AND IT BUT I STILL DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY A YOU HAVE TO CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE COLLEGE BILL DO THIS WHY CAN'T THE EXISTING COLLEGES DO THAT IS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN ARGUMENT. AS TO WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATE COLLEGE AND HAVE SEPARATE COURSES BECAUSE- WE CAN'T WORK ON A COMMITTEE ON A SEMESTER SYSTEM AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDER OWN PACE. AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. AND MAYBE I MISUNDERSTAND AND SOME OUT BARRIER TO. MY COURSES BE DONE THROUGH OUR OTHER. COLLEGES SO THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE A WHOLE SEPARATE COLLEGES TO DO THAT. IT'S A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY IT'S A DIFFERENT CURRICULUM- IT'S- IT IT REQUIRES DIFFERENT CONTRACTS WITH- WITH FACULTY BECAUSE THEY'D BE TEACHING SO I JUST THE BECAUSE AND I APOLOGIZE- BUT JUST AS WE GET TO THE POINT SO USING THE FACULTY REFUSING TO DO THIS- I'M I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M JUST. SAYING WHAT DISTINGUISHES. YOU KNOW IT AND WHY IT'S DIFFERENT THE AND ALSO. YOU KNOW IT DOES IT'S A FAST CHANGING FIELD IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIMENT IN A IN A WHOLLY FOCUSED WAY WITH IT WITH MINISTRATION IT'S- YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP OF THE COLLEGE FOCUSED ON. ALL THOSE AT THE- AN ABLE TO A- REACHED STATEWIDE CAN EMPLOYERS. AND STUDENTS IN A IN A WAY THAT A THAT A LOCAL DISTRICT IT WOULD HAVE MORE MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY. AND HE THE- END IT IS A IN A IS A- FOR THE STUDENTS THAN THAN WHAT MOST COMMUNITY COLLEGES- OFFER TODAY. ALL RIGHT IT'S OKAY I GOT YOU.GOT THAT BUT I JUST WONDERED WE NEED TO HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE COLLEGE FOR THAT SO. BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN I MEAN. THE EFFORT AND WE CAN SEE THIS REPORT HOW MANY YEARS IS GOING TO TAKE ITS AT OUR- AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAD A HUNDRED MILLION AND ALLEN TWENTY MILLION EVERY YEAR- AND- AT NIGHT I GUESS. I'M STILL LIKE IT SO. I STILL UNDERSTAND WHY. EXISTING PROGRAMS CAN'T DO THE SAME THING- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO PREPARE. FOR JOBS BUT WHAT I HEARD YOU'RE SAYING ALTHOUGH IT. IN THE REPORT I SEEM TO GET SOME EXPRESS IT IS. THE PART OF THIS COLLEGE. NOT THE GROUP. IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE CERTIFICATE THAT YOU CAN GET SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING A FULL DEGREES SO. ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME GOAL TO ESTABLISH DEGREES SO THAT SEEMS TO BE ALONE CONFLICT HERE- THAT THIS WAS A WHILE THE REST OF THE COLLEGES OF FOLKS SOME PEOPLE GETTING THEIR DEGREES ARE ALTHOUGH WE DO KNOW THAT MANY OF ACTUALLY MANY PEOPLE GO TO THEIR LOCAL COMMITTEE COLLEGE NOT FOR DEGREES BUT- OKAY. THAT THEY'RE MORE FOCUSED DEGREES THIS ONE'S MORE ABOUT CERTIFICATE. AND IN MANY WAYS I GUESS THE CLARIFICATION IS THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH I MEAN MAYBE THEY'LL HELP THEM GET A NEW JOB. BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FOR PEOPLE ARE WORKING A READY. I ASSUME THIS WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE FOCUSED ON HELP PEOPLE HAVE FIGURE SKILL SETS FOR PROMOTIONS THAT MAKE THEIR MEASURE THAT AND SAYING BECAUSE THREE WORKING RIGHT NOW THEY COULD BE PREPARING FOR A NEW CAREER THAT'S- WHAT AND- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO CALL. IS THIS. GET TO THE ENTERING YOU FEEL THEIR TREE OR IS THIS ASSERTIVE TO THAT'LL YOU TO PROGRESS WITHIN YOUR OWN CAREER THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN'T BECAUSE WELL THEY SAY WE NEED ANOTHER CERTIFICATE OR SOMETHING ELSE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE OF THE ADVANCE PROMOTED OR WHATEVER ELSE SO- SO I'M JUST IT IS ON THIS YEAR'S TALKING ABOUT IT. I WON'T BE SURE WERE USING THE RIGHT METRIC TO MEASURE WHAT IS SIXTY THE SUCCESS OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE PROPOSING- BECAUSE IF IT'S- YEAH. IT TIME TO WRAP YOU CAN. ANSWER THAT ALL ANSWERED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. WHY WE CREATED THIS AND WHAT WERE THE EXPECTATIONS LAID OUT ON DAY ONE- ONE- THIS IS NOT ABOUT A CASUAL IN AN OUT TO DETERMINE TO GET SOME CERTIFICATE THAT ALLOWS YOU. TO GET- A BETTER WAGE IF YOU'RE ALREADY LEARNT EARNING A GOOD WAGE THIS IS ABOUT A GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS- THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY THIS ECONOMY A GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO ACTUALLY I JUST THAT I'VE HEARD THAT WE THIRDS OF THE MULTIPLE TIMES CAN YOU JUST GET TO THE POINT SO WHO IS IT FOR. EXAMPLE I MEAN WE ARE ARE THIS POPULATION WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE FOR THEM FORGOT THIS COP VERSUS BUT STATE OR LOCAL COLLEGE WILL. IS AT ONE VETERAN ONE OF SUCCESS. IS MOBILITY IS WAGE GAIN THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES ALL RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT SO I HOPE FOR MEASURING THAT YES OKAY SO THAT'S GONNA ELECTRIC IS WAGE GAME OKAY NOW APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN- BECAUSE I THE ONE SOME CLARITY THERE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING. SO AND SO WE SHOULD BE COMPARED IT TO WAIT IN A FEW GO TO IT RIGHT COMMUTER REGULAR OF THIS SHOULD X. THE WAIT PEOPLE GO TO THIS COLLEGE. SHOULD EXCEED THE WAGE GAIN OF PEOPLE GO TO TRADITIONAL COMMITTEE COLLEGE THAT SHOULD BE THE METRIC. THE METRIC SHOULD BE PEOPLE WHO ARE. AT OR BELOW LIVABLE WAGES TO SAYS GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED ECONOMIC MOBILITY. BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS OR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT SHOULD BE THE METRIC IN MY ESTIMATION I GUESS THE ONE OTHER COMMON IN AND NO I MADE IT- YEARS AGO IN THIS CAME UP IS THAT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO WHEN YOU'RE PATHWAYS WELL IT'S TOUGH TO BILLING CODING IT'S NOT REALLY HEALTH CARE- IT'S THE ADMINISTRATIVE PART. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION AND- AND WE THINK ABOUT LOT OF THE OTHER EDUCATION WHEN THE CONCERNS AGAIN IS THAT. WE SER THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING BEING ONLINE BUT A LOT OF THE- CAREER WHERE YOU HAVE AN OP. FOR PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO ENTRY. LEVEL IS A IN AND THAT'S AND HEALTH CARE OTHER PLACE DO REQUIRE SOME KIND OF. HANDS ON AT SOME POINT GREAT I MEAN YOU YOU I MEAN IT'S GREAT YOU CAN. DO THINGS ON THE COMPUTER AND MAYBE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO ON THE COMPUTER BUT SOME POINT YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE TO. DEMONSTRATE SOME PROFICIENCY HANNAH AND ARE YOU CAN READ ABOUT IN THE BOOK BUT EVENTUALLY SHOW YOU CAN DO IT. AND THE AND SO AND APPRECIATE THAT NOW CREATE A COLLEGE THAT HAS TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND SHOULD HAVE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE SIX THE PUT THE EXISTING. VISUAL IDEAS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A DUPLICATION ALSO THAT BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT ONE ADVANTAGES. DO PROMOTING ONLINE IT. THROUGH EXISTING STRUCTURE IS THAT. PROBABLY NOT ALL THERE MAYBE IF YOU EAT ICE LEAGUE SAMPLES BUT A LOT OF LEARNING. PROBABLY SHOULD BE A BLAND RIGHT WE WANT TO TREAT THE CONVENIENCE AND- PACING AND SO FORTH AVAILABLE THROUGH. AN ONLINE MECHANISM BUT ALSO- IT. AND DEAL AGAIN BM BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE CUT CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PLAYERS- THEY ALSO PROBABLY WANT SOME POINT THEM DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PERSON CASH DO SOMETHING. BEYOND JUST WHAT THEY CAN DO ON A COMPUTER. AND HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT LINKAGE SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THE KIND OF CERTIFICATES THAT PLAYER'S VALUE AND- THEREFORE. AGAIN THAT'S ABOUT. GETTING PEOPLE MORE. THE LADY PROPERTY THE END FOR. AT M. YES. ONE THINGS WERE. THE CITY IS BRING OUT MORE PATHWAYS SO FOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN ARE LESS. ABOUT JUST DOING STUFF ON THE COMPUTER. IT'S GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU INCORPORATE. THIS THE TOWN'S UP. AND OF NOT JUST YET. ABOUT SO OF ELEVATION THAT MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO CONVINCE AN EMPLOYER JUST. GET OF THE- AND AT LEAST TO THE. TALK BUT- SO THAT'S MY THAN. I DO AGREE WITH YOU CENTER I THINK THAT IS SO A QUESTION THAT ONE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE SKILLS THAT. WORKERS LEARNERS ARE CHAIN UP TO A ALLOW THEM ACCESS INTO OTHER JOBS THAT IS A VERY VALID QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT A QUESTION ABOUT THE MODEL THE CALIBRATE WILL BE USING. OKAY THANK YOU THE SHARING OF WE INTERRUPTED YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING WHICH I VERY MUCH SUPPORT. THAT'S OKAY SEVEN. PROBABLY DESERVE TO BE INTERRUPTED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I APOLOGIZE IF SO MY **** QUESTIONS ARE DUPLICATIVE THIS JOB REQUIRES US TO SOMETIMES DO TWO THINGS HOW TO CLONE MYSELF SO. WE'RE GONNA ON THAT. I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I THINK THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ELSE BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAL RIGHTS COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION MODEL. AND TRADITIONAL ONLINE. COURSES FOR EDUCATION AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A COMPETENCY BASED MODEL TO CALIBRATE IS USING- BASICALLY ALLOWS A STUDENT TO- START AND STOP AT ANYTIME YOU'RE NOT BOUND BY A SEMESTER OR QUARTER CALENDAR- IT'S- IT IS ALSO YOU PROGRESS AT YOUR OWN PACE AND YOU AFTER YOU'VE- ABSORBED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MATERIAL YOU YOU SHOW THAT YOU'VE MASTERED THAT COMMON SEE THEN YOU MOVE UP TO THE- NEXT LEVEL. I'M AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THAT TO THE MOST TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES ARE TAUGHT EVEN THE ONLINE COURSES- GENERAL NEED TO BE TAUGHT THAT WAY. THE AS I SAID YOUR OUT OF THE ROOM HOPE IS THAT BY CALIBRATE LEARNING THE BEST METHODOLOGY FOR DOING THIS THAT THEY WILL THEN BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT- THAT THAT LOT KNOWLEDGE WITH THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEY CAN BEGIN TO OFFER. SIMILAR KINDS OF COURSES THAT CAPITALIZE ON THE ON THE FACULTY AND THE AND THE STUDENT. BODY THAT THEY TRACKED. AT THE PACE I CAN GO FOUND IF I HAVE TIME I CAN GO SLOWER IF I NEED MORE TIME. YEAH AND THEY NEVER HAVE TO GO TO A BRICK AND MORTAR COLLEGE AND- AND IT ALSO IS- IS TARGETED AT SPECIFIC JOBS- THE NOTION OF CALIBRATED THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WHATEVER TRAINING WE'RE OFFERING WHATEVER SKILL BUILDING WE'RE OFFERING IS- IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO JOBS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING TO FILL. I THINK. SO I HAVE YOU SET FOR THE I'M NOT A FAN OF ON. BECAUSE I THINK THAT HE INTERACTION INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO HAVE. THAT WE LIVE IN IT PRINT PAGE THEN WHEN I WENT COOL BEEN WORK. UP HERE WE- NONE OF THE- MEAL OR OF US HAVE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HERE HAVE LAID OFF OUR JOB. FOR SELECT YES. YEAH FOR THEM. I THINK THE YOU KNOW DO HAVE SOME CRITICS OF HELP MOOD FOR BUT I DO DON'T WANT US TO THROW OUT THE BABY WITH THE BATH WATER AND WE HAVE TO I THINK IF IT MEETS STUDENTS WHERE THEIR NEEDS ARE AND IF CALL ME IF I'M WRONG GET THIS HANDY DANDY WILL UPDATE THIS MORNING YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND TEN- INSTANT RIPPLED CONTROLS AND- IT PULLED A PROGRAM PATHWAYS. BACK YES IS BETTER IN THE SENSE THE I. THAT THEY WLL MOVE I GREAT INTO OF THE PATH ABSOLUTELY NO I TOTALLY GET THAT MY QUESTION IS WERE ANY OF THESE STE AND IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SETTING BEFORE THEY CAME TO CAL BRIGHT. I'M AFRAID I DON'T THE ANSWER TO THAT- WE CAN GET THAT FOR YOU MY UNDERSTANDING WAS NOW. IS THAT THESE ARE ALL STUDENTS THAT WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND TELL THE AND ROLLED AND CAL BRIGHT SO FOR WHATEVER REASON THIS APPEALED TO THE STUDENTS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND THE AGES. IT'S QUITE A VARIETY OF AGES AND QUITE A VARIETY OF ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS SO IT DOES SEEM THAT IT'S SERVING A DIVERSE POPULATION. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS. BUT HE SAID IT NAM CITY AND YOU JUST STARTED ROLLING STUDENTS IN OCTOBER SO I THINK THAT. IT'S STILL MIGHT FIND THIS THAT WORKS FOR THEM. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE AS A COMMITTEE AND AS THE LEGISLATURE LOOKS AT. AT CAL BRIGHT THAT WE CONSIDER EVERYTHING- THAT WE CONSIDER EVERYTHING SO THAT WE MAKE SURE WE'RE TRYING TO. DO THE BEST WE CAN FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MOVE UP ECONOMICALLY AND THAT WE CAN'T LET. TRADITIONAL COLLEGE GET IN THE WAY OF SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE NEW AND HELPFUL TO OUR HARD TO REACH STUDENTS AND I SEE THE STUDENTS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN CALIBRATE AS STUDENTS THAT HARD TO REACH- AND THEN THERE WAS A QUESTION. ABOUT WHY DON'T WE JUST DO THIS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS- I'VE HEARD SOME YOU KNOW THIS IS THE A STATE WIDE PROGRAM SO IT IS SET UP SEARCHABLE DIFFERENTLY. BUT I GUESS I WOULD SAY TO CHANCE KLAY DO YOU THINK THAT CAN CALL US PART BASED. ELL TO DELIVER. EAST EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION LEYVA LET ME BEGIN THAT ANSWER SAYING YOU WILL NOT FIND A BIGGER CHAMPION OF THE COMMUNITY CLLEGES THAN ME IS THE REASON THAT I'M HERE- SO- I BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMUNICATIVE DO A TREMENDOUS JOB WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE THEY SERVE MULTIPLE MISSIONS- AND SO ARE THE EQUIPPED TO BEGIN TO DELIVER COME BASED EDUCATION PLACE. THIS BARB ANOTHER'S THAT WE DO OFFER SOME TYPE OF COMPANY BASED EDUCATION PARTICULARLY FOR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE. BUT THESE ARE COURSES THAT ARE DONE VERY DIFFERENTLY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SCALE THOSE COURSES AND VERY DIFFICULT- TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE- CHANGES THAT WERE SEEN IT IN THE ECONOMY- SO. I DO BELIEVE THAT CAO BRIGHT WILL HELP OUR COLLEGES BEGIN TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS UNDER THE C. B. E. MODEL BUT IT'S SORT OF. A CHICKEN AND THE EGG WE NEED TO HATCH THIS EGG FIRST AND LET. THE WORK BEGINS SO THAT ALL OF OUR COLLEGES CAN BENEFIT FROM. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND I AGREE I AM A HUGE CHAMPION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES- MY ALMA MATER MOUNT SAC THE PRESIDENT IS HERE TODAY I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM HIM BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING ALL STUDENTS AND GIVING EVERYONE AN ECONOMIC ACT OPPORTUNITY. SO THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE NOW MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. WELL I GUESS IT'S MY TIME AGAIN. YOU KNOW I I'VE HEARD THE WORD EXPERIMENT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A MIGHTY PRICEY EXPERIMENT AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND GOING UP AND I GET THE FEELING THAT WE'VE SORT OF PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE AND THEY WERE FEELING OUR WAY ALONG IN THE HOPE THAT THE EMPLOYER. COMMUNITY WILL COME ALONG AND THAT WE WILL FIND SUCH A STUDENT POPULATION ON A STATEWIDE ASIS SOMEHOW WITH AN INSTITUTION THAT'S- WHETHER YOU'RE A BRICK OR MORTAR NOT CEMENTED IN OAKLAND AND IS NOT IN HIM IT'S APPLE VALLEY PERRIS RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO CHULA VISTA. OR ANYWHERE NEAR IMPERIAL COUNTY. AND THEN ONE OF THE COMMON I HAVE I WANT TO MAKE AND THEN I WANT TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW. IT COULD BE ARGUED HERE THAT IN LISTENING TO THIS IS THAT. THIS IS A MIGHTY POWERFUL CONDEMNATION OF OUR EXISTING. COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT THE SYSTEM IN THE INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS THAT FORMAT. ARE SIMPLY NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. OR CHANGES IN THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY. SUCH THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A SEPARATE STANDALONE INSTITUTION TO DO SO. THAT'S NOT A QUESTION BUT THAT TO COME AND AT SOME POINT YOU BE CERTAIN FREE TO RESPOND TO IT BUT- I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS TO PROJECT. TO HAVE ENROLLED IN. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY SIX. QUESTION WHAT'S THE PROJECTION BASED ON. I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION- AT MY FINGER TIPS AND- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT TO YOU WHAT DO YOU KNOW WAS THERE A SURVEY OF HIM AS THE ALL HAS TO QUESTIONS TOLD THEY'RE ALL IN LOSS COULD ONLY ASK ONE BUT ALL IS GOOD COMPOUND QUESTION WHAT IS A STATE WIDE MARKET FOR THIS. AND HOW IT HOW WAS THAT STATE WIDE MARKET. FIGURE DETERMINED. WAS THERE A SURVEY OF EMPLOYERS CONDUCTED THAT PRODUCED THE PROJECTION OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED BECAUSE IT WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NOT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AT NINETEEN THOUSAND AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. IT WAS A NUMBER. SO I WILL NOT SPEAK TO THE TWENTY TWO THAT FOUR HUNDRED BUT I WILL SPEAK TO THE EMPLOYER PART OF THIS HOW WE DETERMINE THE MARKET WHEN WE INITIALLY CAME BEFORE YOU OF A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT MARKET WAS DETERMINED THROUGH NUMEROUS- EMPLOYER ENGAGEMENTS UP AND OWN THE STATE I BELIEVE THERE WERE LIKE TEN FORUMS WITH IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE WITH DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH CARE TO ADVANCED MANUFACTURING- LOGISTICS. HEALTH CARE- WE ALSO HAD ENGAGEMENTS WITH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT MANY OF THOSE JOBS FOR EXAMPLE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH. A U. H. W. ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE ISSUES. TO LEARN WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WE WORK WITH THE JOINT TRAINING CENTERS- BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND LABOR. SO THAT INITIAL- AGE GROUP TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE I BELIEVE IT WAS AN AROUND TWO POINT FOUR TWO POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS WAS HOW WE GOT TO THAT NUMBER- THAT IS WHAT WE HEARD FROM EMPLOYERS. THAT THAT IS- DEMOGRAPHIC OF WORKERS THAT THEY FELT IS IN NEED OF SOME. RAPID UPSCALING- AND SO AS WELL AS WORKING WITH- THE CHAMBERS AND PLACES LIKE THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND OTHERS. THAT'S FOR THAT INITIAL NUMBER CAME FROM- I WOULD HAVE TO ASK THE CAL BRIGHT FOLKS HOW THE- THEN PROJECTED OUT THEIR ENROLLMENT TO TWENTY TWO THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED I'M SURE. YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK HIM. BUT WILL ALSO LET ME AS THIS SO IN YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE UNNAMED EMPLOYERS DID YOU ASKED HIM ARE ARE YOU ARE YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES- PROVIDING THE SERVICE TO YOU HAVE YOU CONNECTED WITH YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF. NEED THAT YOU'RE A DENTAL CRYING AS PART OF OUR OUT REACH PROGRAM ME WAS THERE ANY SORT OF. BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAVE YET TO HEAR THE NAME OF A SINGLE EMPLOYER I HAVE QUESTIONS DOWN BELOW THAT I'VE NOTED. I WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SEVERAL NAMES OF EMPLOYERS WELL I HAVE SOME. ON A- YES SO WE GET THE- IS PRESENT QUESTION DID YOU. YES A BETTER I DON'T I BE A- I AND IT. HELLO ONE. TO REACH EMPLOYERS AND COUNTIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT I CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME I DON'T GET IT AND WHAT I ALSO DON'T GET IS HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST. TO MARKET THIS PROGRAM I WOULD BET IT'S MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HOW DO YOU DO IT LET ME UNLESS YOU'RE UNLESS OVER TALKING ABOUT. ARE THE AMAZONS THE U. P. S. IS THE FED EX'S. AND HAD A COUPLE MORE TO THE STACK. WHO HAVE CENTRALIZED HR OPERATIONS WHO CAN PASS THE WORD DOWN TO THEIR PLANT MANAGERS AND SAY SIGN UP WITH CAL BRIGHT. LET ME LET ME ASK FIRST ABOUT THE ERROR RESPOND TO THE UP TO THE OAKLAND- HEADQUARTERS THE AND I DO WANT TO SAY THERE'S JUST- THAT THE CALIBRATE STAFF IS SCATTERED- STATEWIDE AND THEY AND THEY DO A LOT OF THEIR WORK VIRTUALLY AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE- YOU KNOW. HOW OAKLAND IS THE OFFICIAL HEADQUARTERS IT'S A WE WORK FACILITY SO IT'S NOT PERMANENT- AND THAT- AND THAT A LOT OF THE- A LOT OF THE- WORKERS WORK REMOTELY AND CONNECT USING USING TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT'S FRANKLY HOW REACH OUT TO STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE YOU KNOW A LOT OF. EVEN A LOT OF THE ARMS THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TRAINING BEFORE HE DONE REMOTELY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO- YOU KNOW TO A LOCAL EMPLOYER AND PROVIDE- WORKERS THERE'S SO MANY WORKERS WHO NOW WORK REMOTELY AT LEAST PART OF THE TIME AND SO- PARTICULARLY IN THE KIND OF JOBS THAT WERE TRAINING PEOPLE. OR SO IT'S THE END OF THE WHO I THINK IT IT WILL BE ABLE REACH. YOU KNOW STATEWIDE AND- USING IT BASED MARKETING IS A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TO A BILL IN THE- IS. DOING MORE HANDS ON WORKING WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND HAVE A- YOU KNOW WE'RE THERE WAS A STE WORKFORCE THE- A TRAIN PEOPLE THAT WOULD THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT GOING TO OUT TO. BE COOPER OF EIGHT. NINE IN THAT. AND THAT WE THE- THEIR AGE ONLINE IN THE DROPS EVEN ON THE AFTER THEIR- PLEASE THREE PROBE THAT YOU CURRENTLY NO. CODE CYBERSECURITY AND I TEASE. MAYBE IT WAS A THIRD BUT CERTAIN. BLEW PAST ME FOR THESE PRO SELECT. DID AMAZON SO THEY NEED. EVEREST HERO SUPPORT AND THEY NEED FOR HUNDRED AND OF THE AND SO YOU FIGURE PRODUCE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SERVICES I TISA BY DID DO. REGIONAL JOBS AND JOB IS SAYS AND VERSION IN THE STATE TO DID BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT FIGURE DOES NOT EXIST NLESS YOU DID IT. DID YOU DO REGIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF JOBS AND JOB SKILLS BY REGION IN THE STATE TO DETERMINE WHAT SPECIFIC JOBS AND WHAT'S SPECIFIC SKILLS ARE REQUIRED IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE INLAND. OF INLAND CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINE HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR PROGRAMS. THAT'S A QUESTION OF THE FOLLOW UP WOULD BE. IF NOT- WE SIMPLY DESIGNING A PROGRAM AND HOPING THAT THE JOBS COME. I THINK IF IT WAS A LETTER SENATOR YOU NEED TO CLOSE THIS THING THEM- IF THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING THEN THEN THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS BUILT TO DO IT WAS BUILT TO DO THE OPPOSITE. DID TO THE FORMER WHICH IS TO CREATE DIRECT PARTNERSHIPS THE REASON THAT MEDICAL CODING IS WHERE IS LISTED AS A PROGRAM. IS SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAD WITH THE UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS DIGNITY HEALTH AS WELL AS AS SUTTER HEALTH. THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT PROGRAM PATHWAY CAME FROM AND IT WAS INTRODUCED IN THIS ROOM IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN ASKED. WHAT PROGRAM WOULD YOU BEGIN ITH AND WHY AND SO- THIS IS EITHER THE SAME WORKERS THAT ARE NOW ACCESSING SIMILAR EDUCATION FROM SALT LAKE CITY THROUGH UNIVERSITY CALL WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY. AND IF THE SALT LAKE CITY CAN REACH CALIFORNIANS I'M SURE OAKLAND TO REACH CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THEY ARE REACHING THEM NOW- AND I ASSURE YOU THOSE FACULTY ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ORGANIZED- OPERATE FACULTY WILL- SO. THIS IS NOT A CONDEMNATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I KNOW YOU YOU MADE THAT COMMENT THIS IS A CONDEMNATION OF THE DAY THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM- A AND I WERE LETTING OTHER INSTITUTIONS PRIDED SALT FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME CRAZY BUT BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE OF. PRINCE TO BE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN CRITICS IS NOT SOME OF THAT THIS IS MY JUSTIFIED AND PERHAPS ISN'T. DEPENDING ON THE INSTITUTION IN THE- BUT- TO SHOW. BUT WAS IS CHOSEN AT THE OTHER BETTER NOW TIED TO JOB BUT SOUL SO YEAH USES. DIGNITY HEALTH NAY FOR MAY CODE PEOPLE RIGHT DO WE THIS THING DOWN NO. MEDICAL CODING IN OF ITS- WILL SOON BE AUTUMN. AS WELL. BUT MEDICAL CODING ALLOWS FOR MANY WORKERS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THIS CANNOT BE A TERMINAL CREDENTIAL IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM OUR HOPE IS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY ACCESS CALIFORNIA GIVE ME COLLEGES OR ANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION. AS A WAY NOW AN ENTRYLEVEL AN ON RAMP TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS SOON IS THAT STUDENT IS COMPLETED THEIR MEDICAL CODING. CERTIFICATION YEAH I WOULD EXPECT THAT CALIBRATE BEGIN TO HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE CREDENTIALS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU FURTHER ECONOMIC MOBILITY WORKING WITH THE COLLEGES IN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO CONNECT THEM IF THEY'RE LIVING IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HOLD OFF ON THAT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT MANY INSTITUTIONS. HAVE OF THE. THAT THE ME THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS. THE YOU HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THE AND TWO ACCOUNT. TO THOSE OUT FOR BOB WHAT WHAT WOULDN'T ME AS ANOTHER SO. IN THE ANNOUNCED IN THIS AND STUFF THAT I READ TO GET PREPARED FOR THIS SINCE I WASN'T REALLY. IN THIS POSITION CERTAINLY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I BELIEVE THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE AND THE DVD DE DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS THAT THE ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSES TO OFFER OUR WATER THE WORDS HAVE JOB MARKET VALUE TO CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIES WAS THAT DETERMINATION MADE IN ADVANCE AND IF IT WAS WAS IT MEMORIALIZED IN SOME FASHION. I'M NOT AWARE THAT IT WAS MEMORIALIZED BUT CERTAINLY AS WE WENT AS ALL THREE PATHWAYS WERE DEVELOPED THERE WAS DIRECT COMMUNICATION AND IF A AND R. AT SE IF YOU RECALL BUT AT THE TIME- THE DIRECTOR OF THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT STATE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD DID SYFY. BEFORE THIS BODY IT'S THE EDUCATION CODE REQUIRES YES THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THAT WORKS A WISE MOVE- I DON'T KNOW THAT T'S BEEN MEMORIALIZE SINCE THAT TESTIMONY WHEN THESE FIRST THREE PAF WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BUT CERTAINLY I CAN TO I CAN ASSURE YOU. THAT A- THANK YOU BE IN CONTACT WITH THE NEWS LABOR TO THE SUIT TO IN THAT SHE GETS WHAT SHE NEEDS AND HER ENTIRE ORGANIZATION FROM CAL BRIGHT WHAT THEY NEED NOW THEY ARE REORGANIZING- THEIR AGENCY AND WE HAVE BEEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT AGENCY AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT CAL BRIGHT RESPOND TO AND WORK WITH OF THAT AGENCY IS REQUIRED BY EDUCATION CARP I MEAN I JUST THE BUSINESS PLAN SEEMS. FLOOD HERE. AND I SAID KERR BEFORE THE HORSE FULLY BELIEVE CART BEFORE THE HORSE TO ME WE HAVE PROGRAMS. THE EDUCATION CODE REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS BY THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND EDIE ORGANIZATIONS ON JOB MARKET. VALUE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES MY PERSONAL OPINION HAVE ISSUES BECAUSEWE DON'T HAVE ANY REGIONAL JOB. SKILL JOB VACANCY JOB NEED ANALYSIS IN THE STATE IN ANY REGION ANYWHERE ANYTIME AND THAT'S ESTABLISHED IN SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT ARE IN SOME OF THE MATERIALS AND THEN THE MILESTONE REPORT FOR EXAMPLE I'VE GOT A QUESTION ON ONE OF THOSE. SO I DID SHOULDN'T THERE BE AN EVIDENCE BASED DETERMINATION OF JOB MARKET VALUE BEFORE WE SPEND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ON PROGRAMS. I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH THAT SENATOR. CAL BRIGHT HAS TO WORK IN ALL OF OUR COLLEGES HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING NOW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. WHETHER IT'S ET DE- DEPARTMENT OF LABOR- THIS IS THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE WE ALSO WORK WITH. OUR CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THAT PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT DATA WE ALSO WORK WITH- THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY WE WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS- THAT DO THIS. OF FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THE BEST- IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES CAN INFORM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW TO IMPROVE THAT. IT IS OUR IT IS IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN DIVISION FOR SUCCESS THAT WE BEGIN TO MEASURE ECONOMIC MOBILITY IN TERMS OF WAGE GAIN IN TERMS OF REGIONAL LIVABLE WAGES. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION DEBTS. IN CALIFORNIA- BUT WE DO NEED THE LEGISLATURE'S HELP IN THE GOVERNOR'S HELP TO IMPROVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE I WILL CERTAINLY AGREED WE DON'T SEEM TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION IN EDUCATION TO. OF THE EXPECTATION OF OUR CUSTOMER. AND IN THIS CASE CUSTOMERS ARE STUDENT AND IN MOST CASES WHAT THEY REALLY WANT OUT OF THIS EXPERIENCE. YOUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOUR CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE BECAUSE SYSTEM ISSUE YOU SEE A GOOD PAYING JOB AT THE END OF THE DAY YES BUT BUT- ENOUGH OF. WHAT I SEEM TO THINK QUESTION. DOES CALIBRATE HAVE. AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYERS FOR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS BECAUSE I ASSUME AND YOU CAN INCLUDE THIS IN THE RESPONSE. THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE OR WHATEVER IT IS STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN CALIBRATED OF AN EXPECT X. AS HAVE AN EXPECTATION AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. THAT THEY WILL MOVE INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND THAT CERTAINLY IN YOUR BUSINESS PLAN CORRECT IT IS IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN WE DO NOT HAVE ANY AGREEMENTS CONSUMMATED YET THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF- EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WHERE- CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT BY THE TIME THIS THIS GROUP OF. STUDENTS IS COMPLETED THAT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ON THE JOB TRAINING AND ULTIMATELY FULL TIME JOBS. AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TOWARD THAT WE HAVE A TEAM THAT'S OUT THERE EVERY DAY. HOW ABOUT- EMPLOYMENT IN GENERAL DOES CAL BRIGHT HAVE ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY EMPLOYERS. IN CALIFORNIA TO ACCEPT. STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE THE KELP BRIGHT PROGRAM ANYWHERE- THERE IN NO AGREEMENT YET I MEAN IS THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT I THINK I'M PLAYERS ARE STILL. WATCHING TO SEE. HOW IT PROGRESSES AND WE YOU KNOW I ONLY HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT ARE. IN THE PIPELINE IN AND I THINK YOU HOW NEW WE ARE THERE THE YOU KNOW THERE CERTAINLY OBSERVE HOWARD. BUT THEY EITHER ALSO EXCITED ABOUT IT I MEAN THE FACT THAT THAT THEY'VE BEEN WILLING TO HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH US INDICATE THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE'S- REAL POTENTIAL IN CALIBRATION SEVERAL EMPLOYERS HAVE SUBMITTED LETTERS TO THE RECORD HERE TODAY SAYING THAT WE THEY THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT- OF L'IMPORTANCE STEP AS AS TO SEVERAL- EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS VERY COUNCIL ELLIE CHAMBERS SO. WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT IF WE CAN BEGIN TO SHOW- THAT- THE STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING- EXCELLENT TRAINING AND THAT- SOME EMPLOYERS WILL BE ABLE TO BE OUR OUR FIRST TO EXPERIMENT WITH US I KNOW YOU. MAY BE SHOULDN'T USE THE WORD EXPERIMENT ANYMORE BUT- THE- TO START WITH US AND RAN EXPERIMENT. AND THE AND THEN WILL YOU KNOW I AND IT'LL GROW FROM THERE I MEAN I YOU KNOW ITS- IT. IT IS. A BRAND NEW- YOU KNOW ON AND- THE UNTESTED ENTITY AND INK IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S- IT'S A PUBLIC OPTION AT AT LOW COST AND HIGH QUALITY AND HIGH INTEGRITY- FOR- FOR THE WORKERS OF. CALIFORNIA THAT NEED THIS KIND OF HELP AND- AND WE FEEL VERY COMMITTED TO THE MISSION THAT THAT THIS IS- THIS IS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT HAVE THEM. WELL I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE RECORD BUT- HAVE HAVE OUR STUDENTS IN CALIBRATED LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ROLE AT THE BEEP. AND SHIPS OR JOBS OR- OR BOTH AT THE END OF THE PLAN FOR THEM. THEY BEEN. TELL THAT THEIR THAT THERE BE TRAINED THE FOR JOBS THAT EXIST AND THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE EVERY EFFORT WE CAN TO- TO CONNECT THEM WITH THOSE JOBS IN THAT WERE WORKING DILIGENTLY EVERY DAY AND HAVE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH EMPLOYERS THAT COULD- THEY COULD BE THOUGH THE- OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM BUT WE STILL WE STILL A FEW MONTHS- AS I SAY WE JUST WE JUST START- BUT WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW PROBABLY TWO OR THREE MORE MONTHS TO CLOSE SOME OF THESE THESE ARRANGEMENTS. AND BE ABLE TO GET THE- ON THE JOB TRAINING YOU KNOW I THINK- THAT THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO NEED AND THAT WILL HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A FULL TIME JOB FOR THEM BUT I WAS GOING TO QUESTION GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENT. IN A MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY AND YOU HONOR BUT TWO TO THREE MONTHS TIME. HERE YEAH I MEAN BUT IT WOULD NOT WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH I MEAN THESE. CONVERSE BEEN GOING ON FOR THREE FOUR MONTHS. YOU AND I'M SURE YOU UNDER. IT'S A VERY CRITICISM THAT WE LAUNCH SHOULD THE- FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY. PUSHING PEOPLE OUT WITH CERTIFICATES AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB YEAH WE'RE COMPLETELY DETERMINED FOR THAT NOT TO HAPPEN IT'S A DIFF TOTALLY DIFFERENT MODEL OUR MODEL IS TO. IS TO HELP THE STUDENTS SUCCEED AND THAT'S AND WE HAVE. WE ALSO HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM ONCE THEY FINISH THEIR- THEIR THEIR CERTIFICATE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING AND- AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LAND. IN IN A POSITION THAT WILL HELP THE MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER. AND MOVING INTO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AREA I WAS FASCINATED WHEN I READ THE MILESTONE REPORT THAT IT APPEARS THAT CAL BY IS PROPOSING TO MOVE. SORT OF OUTSIDE THE EDUCATIONAL ARENA AND TO WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE- EMPLOYMENT AGENCY STAFFING SERVICES. MILIEU BY SERVING AS AN EMPLOYER OF RECORD FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND- OTHER LIABILITIES AND THEN CHARGING JOB PLACEMENT FEES. FOR STUDENTS WHO MOVE IN TO- THE EMPLOYMENT. OPPORTUNITIES WE CERTAINLY HOPE WERE ABLE TO SECURE BY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYERS SOMEWHERE. WHAT WAS THE REST OF FOR THAT IN. IS THAT. WHAT WAS THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITH TO THE- A DECISION I AM MOVING THE DIRECTION. THAT WAS THAT WAS I THINK A GOAL OF THE COLLEGE UNDER A PRIOR LEADER I THINK ARE FROM A BOARD PERSON WE WANT TO- PROVIDE THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT THAT EMPLOYERS WANT TO NEED WE THINK IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WITH EVERY EMPLOYER WERE. NINETY TWO SEPARATING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR- FOR ALL THE EMPLOYERS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH AND- THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW BRINGING IN A NEW LEADER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THOSE KIND OF ARRANGEMENTS AND DETERMINE IF WE NEED TO MAYBE- YOU KNOW OFFER A NUMBER OF FLEXIBLE OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYERS WHICH SHOULD BE MY INSTINCT AND DIRECTION. IF I CAN AT SENATOR THAT IS SOMETHING WE DO NOW AS A MATTER OF FACT- CAL THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES- HAS AN ARRANGEMENT WITH MANY OF OUR COMPLETE COLLEGES ACTS AS THE EMPLOYER RECORD TO. THIS TO NAY FOR WORK LEARNING IS NOT IN HERE IT BY THE X. EMPLOYERS SOME HAVE OVER THE COST. OF KNOWING THIS TO OPERATE IN THIS AN. SO I THINK IT SOMETHING THAT CAL BREAKING LEAN ON AND WORK WITH FOUNDATION WE ALREADY HAVE SOME CA. IN THE CITY BUT BUT BY THE WAY THE ARE THE- KERR STUDENTS SERVING DOUBLE TO HIM. OF THE IN. AND OF W. TWO IN OF YOU AND WORK AND WORK. THEY ARE. THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT ALLOWS THEM TO BE TO COVER THE COST OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR THOSE STUDENT WORKERS. ALLOWS THEM ACCESS TO JOBS THAT THEY DIDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE- SO THAT IS A MODEL THAT WE CURRENTLY USE IN THOSE IN THOSE STUDENT WORKERS ARE PAID THROUGH. THE FOUNDATION NOW. THE FOUNDATION CHARGES EMPLOYER. FOR THE COSTS OF THOSE EMPLOYEES BUT A CAR LABOR SING WHAT'S BECAUSE RELEASING. THAT YOU HAVING SERVICES YES ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW FOR US WE WANT EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO SOME SORT OF WORKPLACE LEARNING AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU SENATOR BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WELL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICULAR HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CUT FUNDING. FOR WORKPLACE- LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS SO WE HAVE TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN GET. INTO INTERNSHIPS AND BE PAID INTERNSHIPS- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SOME SORT OF WAGE. I SUPPOSE THAT'S A SUBJECT FOR A DIFFERENT HEARING IN. I HAVE ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS ON HOW YOU DEAL WITH WORKPLACE SAFETY AND ALLOF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE W. TO EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE INS HAVING EMPLOYEES IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORKPLACE BUT- THAT'S PERHAPS FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE. MY REPORT I ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT ONE POINT I THINK IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY NINE SITES TO LIST OF OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS IN A CATEGORY LABELED ANNUAL OPENINGS AND IT'S A LIST AND JUST I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE FIRST ONE AND WAS COMPUTER USERS SUPPORT SPECIALIST AND INDICATES ANNUAL OPENINGS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIX. AND MY QUESTIONS IS I LOOKED AT THIS. PRICE ONE I ASSUME THIS IS IN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T SAY. BUT WHO WHO MADE THE DETERMINATION AND ON WHAT BASIS WAS THE DETERMINATION MADE THAT THERE WOULD BE SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIX OPENINGS FOR COMPUTER USERS SUPPORT SPECIALISTS. IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IN WHAT INDUSTRIES AND WHAT REGION'S. WE GET BACK TO ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY BUT I COULD TELL YOU SENATOR THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE WE FIND WHAT WE CALL CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT LOOKS AT PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF JOB OPENINGS FOR PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES THIS IS FUNDED TO THE STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE. SO WHILE I DON'T HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE EXACTLY WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA NOW THAT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE FUNDS THROUGH STRONG WORKFORCE INITIATIVE AND THAT DRIVES MANY OF THE- DISCUSSIONS AND- DETERMINATIONS AND HOW TO USE A STRONG WORK FORCE DOLLARS BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO RELY. ON DATA IN ADDITION TO DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS- ARE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE TO PROVIDE OUR SYSTEM DATA SPECIFICALLY IN JOB CATEGORIES. AND I HAVE ISSUES THE DATA COLLECTION GENERALLY IN THE STATE IS YOU KNOW SO I WON'T BELABOR THAT LET ME RETURN TO THE DECISION TO. ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE COLLAGEN AND MY UNDERSTANDING FROM READING YOUR REPORTS WAS THERE WERE FOUR OPTIONS AND ARE NO SUSPECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT THERE WERE FOUR OPTIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED. CREATE THE ONLINE PROGRAM ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WITHIN AN EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE OF THEM. TO CREATE THE PROGRAM IS A CONSORTIUM OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES PRESUMABLY THOSE THAT WERE ACTIVE IN THE ONLINE EDUCATION. ARENA HOSTED BY ONE. THREE THE ONE THAT WAS SELECTED CREATE A NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO DO SO FOR CREE TO PROGRAM WITHIN THE EXISTING ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. AND OF COURSE NUMBER THREE WAS SELECTED BUT WHY. WHY WAS THE DECISION MADE. TO NOT USE THE CONSORTIUM APPROACH WHICH WAS OPTION TWO. OR TO CREATE THE PROGRAM INSIDE OF THE EXISTING ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE DIRECTED AND CONTINUE TO DIRECTED INCREASED RATE TO THAT WE I EFFORTS. SO THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS- AND- THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION- ONE WITHIN- YEAH ON A YEAH I IS NOT. AN END TO SEE PER SE IT IS- A FUNDED ORGANIZATION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANGES OFFICE AS WELL AS CONNECTED TO THE FORT HILL THE ANSWER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. THAT IS TRYING TO AGGREGATE. THE DIFFERENT ONLINE- LEARNING OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND BEGIN TO PULL THEM TOGETHER SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO PROVIDE- THE BACK OFFICE SUPPORT THE GOVERNANCE- DEVELOP OUR UNION AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED SO THAT'S WHY COULDN'T EXIST UNDER YEAH BECAUSE- YEAH I ITSELF DOESN'T GOVERN ITSELF IT IS GOVERNED- IN AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT WAYS UNDER FOR HEALTHY ANSWERED ME BECAUSE DISTRICT AND THE CHANCES OFFICE WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE NEW ONLINE. OPERATION WE HAD TO ESTABLISH A GOVERNANCE MODEL WE HAVE HAD TO GO TO YES A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO. TO ACQUIRE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO PAYROLL TO HAVE POLICIES- IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS RIGHT ACTUALLY NO THE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMITTEE COLLEGES DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY OF THAT- THE WHEN CAL BRIGHT WITH ESTABLISHA UTILIZED THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES. TO PROVIDE THE BACK OFFICE SUPPORT DIRECTLY UNTIL WHAT IS SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO THE REASON OUR POLICIES FROM SOUTHERN COUNTY RIGHT THE REASON THAT- IN STATUTE WE WERE REQUIRED IF YOU READ THE STATURE REQUIRES A CHANCE OR TWO TABLETS ANIMAL YOU. LOCAL DISTRICT. THE RELEASE FOR THAT WAS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A LOCAL DISTRICT HAS LISTING BURKE UNIT SINCE THAT. AND WHEN. UBER. HERE'S FOR. CLASS STAFF BEFORE THEY THEM OR- ALLOWS THEM AT THIS TO A EXISTING. UNIT AS WELL AS PER. A NEW. AVENUE TO BEGIN TO WORK. WITH THE COMMUNITY DISTRICT- TO SHARE- INFORMATION- WHAT CAL BREDS DOING TO CREATE PROGRAMS ALIGNED DIRECTLY- SO THAT WAS THE INITIAL REASON WHY- IN STATUE WERE **** TO SET UP THAT ARRANGEMENT AS WELL AS- THERE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IT WAS HAD AT THE TIME THE WAY THAT'S THE SAME. AS MY POINT ISN'T IT YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THE ON LINE IF THERE WERE ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. BUT THE ONLY EDUCATION INITIATIVE HAS NO EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN A CORE STAFF- THOSE EMPLOYEES THOSE FACULTY OF THE FACULTY OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES HELP RIGHT DIDN'T EITHER UNTIL WE YES. RIGHT MY POINT THE OTHER POINT IN IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND YOU KNOW- I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE BERMAN ADMINISTRATION BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF NEGOTIATION. WITH MANY OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATION SINCE CAL AND IT'S INCORRECT HIGHER TO ENSURE THAT CAL I JUST LOOK LIKE A CHARTER. UP ANOTHER DISTRICT. IN THE DIRECT DIRE ENSURE THAT THE CAL BRIGHT BOARD REPRESENTED STATEWIDE- INTERESTS AND THAT WAS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO A LEGISLATURE. THAT WAS A BIG DRIVER OF WHY WAS STATUS WE QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW I COULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER. THINGS TO DO A LOT. FOR THAT. BUT IS A IT BUT TO SOME. GOVERNOR BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF BEING CONCERNED. THAT. LOOK. PREVAILING ISSUES AS TO WHY WAS ESTABLISHES WAY WHAT GIVEN THE FACT THEY WERE ALMOST TWO YEARS DOWNSTREAM IN GIVEN ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED- WOULD YOU MAKE THE SAME DECISION OR MAKE THE SAME RECOMMENDATION TODAY IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE. OUR I WOULD. AGREE AS OPPOSED TO OPTION ONE TWO OR FOUR I THINK. I THINK WE PICKED THE RIGHT OPTION IF I WAS TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY I THINK THERE WOULD BE MORE CLARITY AND WHAT THAT OPTION LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED AND IS THERE A TIME LINE- TO GO TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW THIS COULD HAVE BEEN. DONE AND HOW YOU SELECTED DISTRICT- HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO COMPETING- BARGAINING UNIT AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CREATED- HI YOU DEVELOP. THE INFRASTRUCTURES QUICKLY IS A HAVE- I MEAN ONE IMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE IS FOR EXAMPLE. OF ALMOST ALL OF OUR COLLEGES ARE UNDER THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALLED CANVAS. IN CANVAS IS A STATE WIDE THAT YOU LEGISLATURE OF CALIBRATE COULD NOT. ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER THE CAL CAMPUS MODEL BECAUSE CANVASES NOT PROVIDE- THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO DELIVER COUNTY BASED EDUCATION FOR THIS ALLOWS CALIBRATE WHAT'S THAT MEAN BECAUSE IS A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UP LATER I KNOW THE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IS WHAT THE BASICALLY THE SHELL THE STUDENTS OPERATE IN. TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR COURSES SO WE HAVE GENERALLY- 98% OF OUR COLLEGES OPERATE UNDER ONE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CALLED CAN THAT THE COMPANY- AND SO THAT WAS A GREAT A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT- FOR COMPANY BASED EDUCATION- WHO. STUDENTS HAVE TO OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT ONE THAT IS OPEN ACCESS ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC CALENDAR CAMPUS COULD NOT AT THAT TIME PROVIDE CAL BRIGHT WITH THAT MODIFICATION BUT HAS COMMITTED TO TRY TO DO THAT FOR THIS STORM. SO THIS ALLOWS CAO BRIGHT TO WORK WITH OTHER LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HELP BETTER INFORM CANVAS OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE GONNA NEED TO BE MADE FOR GOING TO SCALE THIS- STATEWIDE SO THIS PUSH AND PULL IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CAL BRIGHT TO BE OPERATING IN THIS WAY BECAUSE- NOW WE HAVE. FACT FACULTY AND STAFF SOLELY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE AROUND HOW TO BEST DELIVER SCALABLE COMES BASED EDUCATION- SO I REALIZE. IT'S A COMPLICATED WEB OF DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT ULTIMATELY- AGAIN IF I WAS TO DO THIS OVER AGAIN- I THINK I WOULD ASK FOR MORE TIME FOR CALIBRATE TO ESTABLISH ITSELF. MORE TIME FOR IT TO. DEVELOP PROGRAMS- AND MORE TIME TO DETERMINE ITS WAY FOR ACCREDITATION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW- ACC JC THE REGIONAL CREDITOR FOR CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT A CREDITOR FOR CALIBRATED- BUT THAT WAS THE DESIRE OF THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TIME. SO THAT WAS. WHAT WE RESPONDED TO WELL UNDER THE STANDARD YOU DON'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR ACCREDITATION UNDER THAT. NOT UNLESS CAL RIGHT DEVELOP AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE AND OTHER THAN ALWAYS A POINT OF DEBATE. YES AT LEAST ONE. NOW ACC JC IS LOOKING AT CHANGING SOME OF ITS STANDARDS AND WE WILL WORK WITH THEM. AS IT AGAINST YOUR CREDIT MORE MORE CBA CB INSTITUTIONS- BUT THAT'S IT'S AN ISSUE FOR ANOTHER DAY FOR NOW THERE IS AN ACCREDITING. A COMMITTEE. THAT COULD CREDIT RIGHT SHOWING I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE- SO IT THE LEAD I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION FINAL. ONE IS GOING TO BE FINE IF. YOUR THING IN. ONE YES WE BE IF THIS LAW. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE A MINISTRY DECIDED TO PIVOT AWAY FROM THE CURRENT MODEL. OPTION THREE TO A CONSORTIUM OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES HEAVILY INVOLVED IN ONLINE EDUCATION WITH THE INSTRUCTION AND OF COURSE THE FUNDING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT TO. INSURE THAT THE ONLINE OFFERINGS. OUR OPEN ACCESS OR COMPETENCY BASED WITH DIRECT ASSESSMENT AT LEAST A CERTAIN PORTION OF THEM AT LEAST THREE OF THEM. THAT THE OFFERINGS BE MARKETED. STATE WIDE THROUGH VARIOUS ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT EITHER ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THE CONSORTIUM. THROUGH THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS OR ARE DEVELOPED AGAIN WITH FUNDING. WHAT DIFFICULTY WITH THAT. IN TALE FOR THE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT. WELL. AGAIN YOU KNOW- I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE MODEL CHOSEN WHAT'S THE BEST GIVEN THE CHOICES AVAILABLE CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION S. CHANCES OFFICE TO BUT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL THE CHALLENGE WITH THE MODEL IS THAT- DISTRICTS ARE GOVERNED LOCALLY- THEY HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS- AND THEY HAVE A MYRIAD OF MISSIONS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY TRYING TO FULFILL- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT I BELIEVE IT WOULD JUST TAKE MUCH MORE TIME. TO BUILD THE CAPACITY NECESSARY TO SERVE AT SCALE THE WORKERS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT- AND SO IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT- YOU DETERMINE WHO ARE WHO ARE THE DISTRICTS BEST POSITION TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY DISTRICT THEY'RE DOING PARTS OF THIS I DO BELIEVE THAT IS SIMPLE FOR COPYRIGHT TWO IS BUSH FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM AN INNOVATION ALLIANCE WITH CALLED THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. TO SHARE IN THE- CREATION OF THE CONTENT IN THE DIRECTION OF CAL BRIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS STILL POSSIBLE- AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE CALIBRATE TO FORM THAT. KIND OF INNOVATION ALLIANCE WITH COLLEGES AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE COLLEGES TODAY THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT. ONE FINAL QUESTION I'M SURE YOU'RE TIRED OF ME. THE IMPLEMENTING A BE FOR THIS WHOLE PROCESS- RECORD THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE YOUR OFFICE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY NINETEEN TO RECOMMEND TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. WAYS OF MAKING ONLINE AND COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS EASIER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE INCLUDING WAYS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS SEES FOR ONE. FUNDING NONCREDIT COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS AND TO OFFERING ON LINE COURSES UNDER A FLEXIBLE CALENDAR THE VERY THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THAT GO TO THE CORE OF CALIBRATE AND THE VERY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO DISTINGUISH CALIBRATE FROM. COMMUNITY COLLEGES I ASSUME THAT YOUR OFFICE DID THAT AND CONTINUES TO DO THAT- WE ARE HAVE WE HAVE A VERY DELIBERATE TO PROCESS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE THROUGH THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE. APPROPRIATE TO THIS ISSUE TO DEVELOP TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW. ALL OF OUR COLLEGES AWAY TO OFFER COUNTY BASED EDUCATION TO CONSIDER THE CHALLENGES TO THE CURRENT CALENDAR TO CONSIDER MANY OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES SO THAT IS HAPPENING NOW. AND WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL WORKING WITH THE STATEWIDE ACADEMICS AND BE ABLE TO DELIVER A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND THIS GOES TO AN EARLIER POINT I MADE AND SORT OF MY- CONFUSION ONE AND CONCERNED AND WE DON'T LOOK ORGANIZED. IT AND THIS IS SORT OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I'LL LET YOU RESPOND TO IF THERE IS A QUESTION SOMEWHERE IN THERE BUT IF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS OR OR IN FACT ABLE TO OFFER NON CREDIT COMPETENCY BASED. PROGRAMS AND THEY DO START OF FLEXIBLE THIS OPEN ACCESS WITHOUT TERMS THAT ARE. BEGINNING AND AN END. THEN WHY PARALLEL TRACK THIS PROCESS AS WITH BROUGHT. TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING. SO CENTER I THINK THAT THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION AND A CRITICAL QUESTION. IN A QUESTION WE DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT- BECAUSE ON ONE HAND AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S ALMOST COMES ACROSS AS A CONDEMNATION OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT MY COMMENTS COME ACROSS AS A CONDEMNATION. MY COMMENTS ARE. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY DE UM. STATES IN A COMMUNICATIVE TRICK HAS SEVERAL COLLEGES TO DO WONDERFUL WORK TO TRY AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE GREATER FRESNO AREA. BUT THEY ARE LOOKING TO ADD ONE MORE COLLEGE THE REASON IS NOT BECAUSE THE OTHER COLLEGES. CAN'T SERVE STUDENTS WHO MADERA IS BECAUSE THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS IN MADERA THAT WOULD BE BEST SERVED BY A COLLEGE SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF THAT COMMUNITY. AND SO THIS IS A MECHANIS THAT WE'VE USED TO GROW INTO THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHILE WE CAN ARGUE AS TO WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THESE THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS AN BE ANSWERED BY A CURRENT CAPACITY- I THINK. THAT HAVE BEEN A GROUP OF FACULTY AND STAFF SOLELY DEDICATED. TO SERVICING THEM NOT AS A BY PRODUCT OR IS A SUB MISSION OF ANOTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT THE SOLE MISSION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN BE ABLE TO OFFER. ON RAMPS TO OTHER COMMITTEE CALLS ACROSS THE STATE I THINK IS THE BETTER ANSWER BECAUSE I WILL ONLY SPEAK FROM MY EXPERIENCE OF LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE MY PREVIOUS COLLEGE- WE HAVE A VERY HAD. THEY STILL HAVE A VERY ROBUST. NON CREDIT PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY IN ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE THEY TRAINED. THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES PARTICULAR FROM CAMBODIA AND FROM VIETNAM THAT CAME OVER AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB. THAT IS A LOCAL MEET. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW FOR CALIBRATED SO SKILLED STATEWIDE NEED IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. EVEN IF WE SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION A MILLION WHATEVER EVEN IF WE TOOK 2% OF THAT THAT IS STILL A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO SERVE. A SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT IS BEST TO CREATE AN ENTITY SOLELY FOCUSED ON THAT AND CAN BE CLEARLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT FROM IT WHEN YOU BURY IT FOR BLACK OF A BETTER TERM IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT OUTCOMES AT SPECIFIC CHARGE. ELEVEN ANY QUESTION FINAL QUESTIONS ARE CLOSING REMARKS BEFORE I CLOSE AT THE PANEL THANK YOU. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT'S VERY FORWARD THINKING THAT WE ARE. WE NEED TO DO THIS AND SCALE IT STATE WIDE AND THAT WAS KIND OF GOES TO THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT MAYBE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF IT. IS THAT WE NEED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY THE YOU KNOW THOSE OF US HER MAKING THESE DECISIONS. WE DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE LIKE MANY OF THESE LEARNERS NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION- ABOUT THE PRESS TENT AND THE PRESIDENT WHO'S NO LONGER AT CAL BRIGHT. I MY UNDERSTANDING IS HER SALARY WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND IS THAT ACCURATE. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK. THAT IS. DO NOT BE SOMEONE ELSE THAT KIND OF MONEY. IF THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA MAKES TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I WOULD SAY HE IS A PRETTY BIG IT'S STRESSFUL. UP DON'T KNOW THE ONE RUNNING PROGRAM TO MAKE UNDER NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PAID WITH TAXPAYER MONEY. MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW. THE LEAGUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION- RELATED TO ACTUALLY AND ANSWERS GIVEN TO SOME OF THE- SIR ROTS QUESTION SO- SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE GRADUATES ARE AT THAT THE OTHER STUDENTS IN THE ONLINE COLLEGE YOU TALKED ABOUT- BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT WELL WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WE'RE GIVING GUIDANCE COUNSELING SO FORTH. SO CAN YOU. SO IS THIS ALL GOING TO BE ONLINE I MEAN COUNSELING. IN BE PARTIALLY DONE ONLINE BUT SO HOW HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PROVIDE THIS ASSURANCE THAT HE WOULD YOU KNOW PEOPLE ASK ABOUT WILL TO GET A JOB AND SO FORTH IS IT WILL GIVE THEM A LOT OF SUPPORT TO GET THE JOB. OKAY SO I GUESS NOT DEFINITELY JOB I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN THIS IS A PROMISE THAT ALL THE HOPE WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT. WILL LEAD TO THAT- BUT HOW. SO HOW WE CAN DELIVER THIS GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING THROUGH CAL BRIGHT- THIS IS JUST GONNA BE ONLINE OURS ARE GOING TO BE A PERSONAL TOUCH. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW COUNSELING WORKS THAT WELL JUST ONLINE. THERE THERE WILL BE TELEPHONE ACCESS THERE ALREADY IS AND THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE EVEN AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THERE'S THEIR CERTIFICATE. AND WHAT SORT OF RATIO OF COUNSELORS TO STUDENTS DO YOU ANTICIPATE STAFFING FOR. UP TO PRIDE THIS. TELEPHONE GUIDANCE. I DON'T HAVE THAT AT THE TIPOF MY FINGERS BUT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A OF. A COMPREHENSIVE OKAY SO YOU WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO MYSELF IN THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I KNOW I AGAIN THIS IS A- PART OF BEING A COLLEGE IS PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT IT'S AND IT'S JUST NOT THE COURSES IT'S ALSO THE SUPPORT AND THE LEVEL SUPPORT. TELEPHONE I GUESS WHO USES BETTER JUST ON THE SCREEN BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S MISTER SUFFICIENT BUT THANK YOU. HI I JUST ME I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S- TELL DOES TELEPHONE OR SKYPE OR YOU KNOW THERE'S A ROOM OR SOMETHING AT THE MAY VERY WELL BE VIDEOS OKAY WELL. THAT PRECEDED YOU COULD- WHEN YOU GET THE INFORMATION PROVIDE THAT AND AS WELL AS THE RATIO OF COUNSELORS. THANK YOU. GENERALIZATION FOR PARTICIPATING I HOPE YOU. DON'T TAKE MY QUESTIONS AS INDICATING ANY SORT OF LACK OF SUPPORT TO I AM CLEARLY A SUPPORTER OF INNOVATIVE EDUCATION EFFORTS SITE. WHEN I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TO GROUPS I TELL THEM THAT WE CANNOT IN CALIFORNIA. DO BUSINESS TODAY THE WAY WE'VE DONE BUSINESS OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS JUST BECAUSE- OUR CUSTOMERS YOUR STUDENTS. THAT DEMANDED ND THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET DEMANDS AT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT I'VE STATED IN SOME THAT I PROBABLY HAVEN'T OVER THE- THE ASSUMPTIONS THE MASSES- THE PREPARATION IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THIS EFFORT- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. SHOULD THE ADMINISTRATION CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE CURRENT DIRECTION TO WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES IN THIS CURRENT DIRECTION OR IF THERE'S A PIVOT FOR ANY ANY REASON TO WORK THROUGH THOSE WITH YOU ON THE PIVOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DELIVER ON DEMAND EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT EDUCATION TO THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED IT WHEN THEY NEEDED SO THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THANK YOU BUT SAYS THE NEXT PANEL TO JOIN US UP HERE IF YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO DO SO. LEAVE IT. WITH. WELCOME TO WHAT'S MY LINE. WHEN YOU'RE SITUATED IF I COULD ASK OF THE PANELISTS TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT AND THAT WOULD BE YOU SIR. I'M JOHN STANCE BECAUSE I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST ASK HIS THANKS FOR JOINING US MA'AM. EMILY ROSENBERGER WITH THAT CHAU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SIR RENDON HOOKER FROM THE EDT EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- GOOD FOR THANKS FOR BEING A REAL STRONG AS A PRESIDENT AMOUNTS SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE. DR STRUGGLES THANKS FOR JOINING US. BECAUSE. MR MAILER IT. I AM GOOD MORNING I'M BOB LANTER DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. THANKS MISTER LANDER FOR JOINING US OKAY WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST. STATUS ARE YOU IT. WE DON'T HAVE TO WE CAN FLIP A COIN NO IT'S FINE. I WILL SAY THAT IF. YOU ARE A LITTLE INTIMIDATING. ALL NO- SO MY NAME IS JOHN STANDS BECAUSE I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES- I REPRESENT THE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND- FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL MATTERS- SO I- WANTED TO PREFACE THAT OUR- JOB AS THE ACADEMIC SENATE- IS TO REPORT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ABOUT EDUCATIONAL POLICIES AND CURRICULAR DESIGN AND THAT WE HELP ALL COLLEGES SERVE STUDENTS AND IT HERE TO THE LAWS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE REGULATIONS CREATED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. AND ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS UP FRONT THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE TO SAY IT MAY SOUND DIFFERENT FROM THAT REPORTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE- CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH AS PART OF OUR ROLE. I COMMEND. THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND OUR CHANCELLOR FOR DEFENDING OUR COLLEGES AND ARE DISTRICTS. AND I WOULD EXPECT THEY WOULD DO SO FOR ANY OF THEM- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS AND SO I WILL TRY TO DO SO TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY- FIRST WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW WE HAVE WORKED WITH CALIBRATE- SINCE THE LAW WAS PASSED- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE- WORKED WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEN. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT IS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. TO A POINT A GROUP OF FACULTY FROM ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT CAN SERVE AS A RESOURCE AND A FACULTY VOICE. AS POLICIES ARE DEVELOPED AROUND ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL MATTERS AS HIRING NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AS ANY OF THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE. FACULTY IN IN A- ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL SETTING THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FACULTY- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW INITIAL BOARD POLICIES. THEY WERE ASKED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE CURRICULUM. THE OTHER PARTS THAT ARE LISTED AS THE JOB OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE ABOUT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT- ABOUT CREATING- HIRING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THERE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN UTILIZED AS MUCH. I'M ALSO IN A ROLE WE HAVE TRIED TO GO TO ALL OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEETINGS OR HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE THERE AND JUSTICE WE WOULD AS ANY ACADEMIC SENATE WOULD FOR ANY LOCAL DISTRICT HE WOULD EXPECT YOUR ACADEMIC SENATE PRESIDENT TO BE PRESENT. AND TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND ADVICE TO THE BOARD WE HAVE TRIED TO FILL THAT ROLE AS WELL UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS THE COLLEGES ABLE TO ITS OWN- INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACULTY ORGANIZE THEMSELVES IN THAT WAY. THE SECOND QUESTION YOU ASKED WITH TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE IN THE WORK THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS DONE WITH THAT- WE OFTEN WORK WITH THE- III IN A STATE MY CAPACITY TO COLLABORATIVELY INSURER STANDARDS IN PROCESS APPROVAL. MUCH OF THE INITIAL IDEAS OF WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS FOR OFFERING ONLINE EDUCATION WERE DONE COLLABORATIVELY. THE ACADEMIC SENATE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THAT THE WE AYE- EXT TOOK ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CREATED THE STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS TODAY IN THE WAY I. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT- LOCALLY SUPPORTING THE CURRICULAR DESIGN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND PARTICULARLY THAT DEVELOPMENT OF THE C. T. E. ONLINE PATHWAYS THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS AGO. UP FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE. I IN A SECOND. THE THIRD QUESTION. ASKED WAS TO DESCRIBE OUR QUESTIONS REGARDING LEFT LEGISLATIVE CLARIFICATION ON DUPLICATION AND ACCREDITATION. SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE WRITTEN YOU LETTERS WHICH IS WHAT WE HOW WE PREFER TO INTERACT WITH YOU. AND NOT THIS WAY. I'M TRYING TO CLARIFY- SOME OF OUR CONCERNS YOU REFERENCED EARLIER THE AUGUST REPORT- FROM CALIBRATE TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE THEY FIRST- TALKED ABOUT HAVING DEGREES AND THAT PROMPTED OUR FIRST LETTER IS THAT WAS PREFACED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE- TO EIGHT. THE TASTY SEE THROUGH THE ACCREDITOR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO PURSUE A DIFFERENT A NATIONAL ACCREDITOR WHERE A DEGREE IT'S NOT REQUIRED- SO SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN ALLEVIATED BUT THERE IS LACK OF CLARITY IN THE LAW ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATOR X. BACK DID IN TERMS OF ACCREDITATION- BEYOND JUST BEING ACCREDITED AND THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN. NATIONAL ACCREDITATION AND REGIONAL ACCREDITATION. THE SECOND TENT FOR ANY- ISSUE RE IS REGARDING- THE DUPLICATION OF PROGRAMS- AND WE HAVE OUTLINED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE DUPLICATION OF PROGRAMS- AND PROVIDED EXAMPLES. AT. IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING THAT- THE EDUCATION CODE LOOKED REALLY CLEAR. TO MOST OF THE FACULTY IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE ABOUT WHAT DUPLICATION OF PROGRAMS MEANT AND THE EXPLANATION PROVIDED BY CALIBRATE BY THEY ARE NOT DUPLICATING. WOULD BE TRUE FOR ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO DO. BY USING THAT STANDARD THERE IS A STANDARD IN TITLE FIVE- IN THIS SECTION OF THE REGULATION THAT GOVERNS COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT IS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THAT DEFINES A PROGRAM. AS A AS AS BEING DEFINED BY THE OUTCOMES OF THE OF THE COURSES AND CONTENT. IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ONLINE OR FACE TO FACE WHETHER IT IS NON CREDIT OR CREDIT OR ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHAT THE PROGRAM IS AND THAT IS THE DEFINITION THAT THE REST OF THE SYSTEM HOUSE TO USE. IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND SO WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE SOME CLARITY IF THIS IS A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF DUPLICATING A PROGRAM- I AM AND WHERE THAT LINE IS BECAUSE WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE ASTOR TATIAN. THE ASSERTION OF CALIBRATE AROUND DUPLICATION. I DID WANT TO TALK TO YOU- A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. A PIECE OF THAT ARE BECAUSE WE- OFFER COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION THAT IS THAT IS THE BASIS OF NON CREDIT NON CREDIT IS DESIGNED IN STATUTE THAT IT CAN BE A OPEN ENTRY AND OPEN EXIT. THAT IT CAN BE- EITHER TRANSCRIPT DOUBLE OR NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRANSCRIPT IT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE STUDENT WANTS OUT FROM THAT AND WE OFFER NON CREDIT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NOT AS MANY OF THEM ARE ONLINE AND THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT THAT ARE STRUCTURAL TO THE SYSTEM WE APPRECIATE THE REPORT THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I RECENTLY SENT TO YOU ABOUT COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS. HOW IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR SYSTEM WE AS WE OF DISINCENTIVE IZED. THAT WE HAVE MADE THAT LESS APPEALING IN TERMS OF HOW WE FIND THE COLLEGES- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. I DID WANT TO SAY. ALSO THAT. THAT THE LAST QUESTION WAS HOW CAN THE STATE BETTER SUPPORT FACULTY IN COLLEGE AS AN OFFERING ONLINE EDUCATION AND I HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS. THE FIRST IS THE- ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE ONLINE- EDUCATION AN ISSUE TO THE COURSE EXCHANGE AND CROSS ENROLLMENT. RIGHT NOW- IS BEING EXPANDED- THROUGHOUT A COLLEGES TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS THAT. YOUR CORRECT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE FIFTY SEVEN- COLLEGES IN THE CONSORTIUM- I THINK THAT NUMBER IS. MOVING TO SEVENTY BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THAT'S AND% THAT THAT HAS BEEN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT IS HAVE INPUT FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW TO SERVE STUDENTS BOTH REGIONALLY AND AS A STATE. I DID WANT TO SAY THAT MOVING AWAY FROM OUR CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE WHICH IS BASED ON WEEKLY STUDENT CONTACT AROUND WHAT THE CALENDAR HAS TO LOOK LIKE. CURRENTLY ADVANTAGE IN FUNDING THE FACE TO FACE COURSE THAT IS A FULL SEMESTER- FOR CREDIT. WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER DIFFERENT WAYS OF INSTRUCTION THAT WOULD MEET THE DEMANDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED NEED TO BE- PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA. TO DO THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THAT FUNDING. STRUCTURE TO DO THAT. AND THE LAST THING. I WILL CLOSE WITH I KNOW YOU WERE ASKED ME TO SPEAK FOR THREE MINUTES AND I HAVE LIKE FIVE HUNDRED OTHER THINGS WRITTEN DOWN HERE SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO LOOK. AT WHAT IS AVAILABLE- THROUGH THE CONSORTIUM YOU JUST HAVE TO TYPE IN CVC DOT EDU. AND IF YOU SCROLL DOWN HERE. TO THE NEXT THING AND CLICK ON. ONLINE CERTIFICATES OF ACHIEVEMENT. THESE ARE NOT DEGREES THESE ARE ONLINE CERTIFICATES OF ACHIEVEMENT FULLY ONLINE AND YOU CAN FIND ALL THREE OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY CALIBRATE HERE. THANK YOU. YOUR OF YOUR VISION YES YEAH THAT'S FINE WITH ME I'M GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO YOU SPEAKS FIRST DR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. SO CALIBRATE IS A AT AN ONLINE C. T. A. C. C. T. CAN COMPETENCY BASED- IN AN EMPLOYER ALIGNED COLLEGE. ASOS MOUNTS ACT AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW WE DO SOME OF THE SAME THINGS THAT- CAL BRIDE HAS IN IN ITS MISSION. WE BEGIN WITH ONLINE CONTACT OFFERS EIGHT ONLINE CTP PROGRAMS FULLY ONLINE- THEY ARE PROGRAMS LIKE- COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION AND- HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BUT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT- BOTH THE DIDACTIC THAT IS THE BOOK LEARNING AS MY DAD WOULD CALL IT AND- HANDS ON- A WORK CAN BE DONE ON A COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM THEREFORE. THERE FULLY ONLINE. WE OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL FULLY ONLINE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AIMED AT ACADEMIC AND TRANSFER PROGRAMS AND IS ONE OF OUR FASTEST GROWING AREAS YEAR OVER YEAR WE GREW 32% LAST YEAR SO NOW- OF NON SECT STUDENTS EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND% NINETY TWO STUDENTS. TOOK ONLINE CLASSES LAST YEAR SO IT IS A TREMENDOUS GROWTH MARKET IN OUR REGION AND STATE WIDE. WE ALSO OUR FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA VIRTUAL CAMPUS CAMPUS ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE- AND SO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE ARE ON OUR PART OF THE COURSE EXCHANGE KNOWN AS- THE. I'M LOSING THE WORK WORD RIGHT NOW- FACT THAT FINISH FAST PROGRAM. I'M I'M ALSO AWARE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE ABILITY TO HAVE THIS COURSE EXCHANGE WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WE WERE SLOW IN IMPLEMENTING YOUR FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE FIRST ATTEMPTS WE HAD WERE CHALLENGING BUT NOW A STUDENT REGISTERED IN ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN REGISTER IN A COURSE AT MOUNT SAC OR ANY OTHER PARTICIPATING- WE AYE COLLEGE WITH A BASICALLY A SEAMLESS. PROCESS THAT'S SPURRED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL POSTING OF COURSES IN THE ONLINE CATALOGUE MOUNT SAC NOW HAS OVER FORTY CLASSES THAT'S BEEN POSTED IN THAT EXCHANGE AND WE REGULARLY EXCEPT- YEAH- FOR CREDIT HANFORD DEGREE COMPLETION COURSES TAUGHT ONLINE AND OTHER COLLEGES. IN THE AREA OF EMPLOYER CONTACTS FOR A WE OFFER. SIXTY FOUR TWO YEAR ASSOCIATE DEGREES IN C. T. E. AREAS AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX SHORT TERM- CITY PROGRAMS AND IS THERE A YEAR OR LESS. SO WE'RE A MAJOR- CTP PROVIDER THE LARGEST IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. FOR ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS WERE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN INDUSTRY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE MEET REGULARLY WITH EMPLOYERS WHO ADVISES ON CURRICULUM ON- BEING UP TO DATE ON WHAT THEIR JOB SPECIFICATIONS ARE THE COMPETENCIES OUTCOMES AND THEY HELP WITH EMPLOYMENT. THOSE PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED BY LABOR MARKET DEMAND YOU HEARD THE CHANCELLOR TALK ABOUT THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE MOUNT SAC HOSTS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE GET THAT LABOR MARKET AT DATA THROUGH THE QUESTION EARLIER AS HOW IS BY CONTRACTING WITH EMS AND- THE SECOND ONE WILL COME BACK TO ME LATER- BUT TO BE CONTRACTED SERVICES THAT PROVIDE US THAT DATA- WITH THE INFORMATION WE GIVE THEM ABOUT THE SEARCH SERVICE AREA AND PARTICULARLY LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR ME. IT AS WE DO THOSE PROGRAMS WE ALSO- INTERACT WITH. THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT MARKET THROUGH THE CENTER FOR COMPETITIVE WORK FOR SAID DOES RESEARCH ON EMERGING- JOB SPECIFICATIONS AND SO ON SO WE TRY TO DESIGN PROGRAMS THE MEET NOT JUST CURRENT LABOR MARKET NEEDS BUT EVOLVE THOSE IN AREAS LIKE AUTOMATION AND A I'D- THEN WE ALSO ARE EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED IN. INTERNSHIPS AND APPRENTICESHIPS THESE ARE CLASSES THAT WE OFFERS OF THEIR CREDIT TRANSFERABLE CLASSES FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE UP FOR IT IN THE CASE OF INTERNSHIPS ARE NEAR THE END OF THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM AND THEIR ASSIGNED IT IT ON A WHIM THE WORK SITE- WITH A EXPERIENCE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE- AN OB THE JOB TRAINING IF YOU WILL THAT'S RELATED TO THE COURSE OF STUDY WHETHER SUPERVISED BY. SOMEONE ON AT THE WORKPLACE AND COORDINATED WITH ONE OF OUR CREDIT FACULTY MEMBERS TO ACHIEVE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THAT SOME AS VOLUNTARY SOME IS PAID WORK. IN ADDITION WE WORK WITH EMPLOYERS TO BE SURE THAT FEEDBACK FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WERE RIGHT ON THE GROUND WITH EMPLOYERS LOOKING AT THE JOB SPECIFICATIONS IT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF INTERACTION WITH EMPLOYERS TO KEEP US CURRENT WITH SOFT SKILLS AS WELL AS HARD SKILLS. WE PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE'S A- PROGRAMS THAT FUNDING YOU MAY KNOW MOVED FROM K. TWELVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. APPRENTICESHIPS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TYPICALLY OUR GRADUATES WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING AND NEED ON THE JOB TRAINING TO GET UP TO SPEED ON WHAT THE EMPLOYER NEEDS. SO THEY'RE PAID BY THE EMPLOYER BUT RELEASED. TO WORK WITH US ON WHAT'S CALLED RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION. A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE KEEP ON TRACK OF ALIGNMENT WITH EMPLOYERS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OUR NON CREDIT- COMPLY. A COMPETENCY BASED VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THESE ARE NON CREDIT SO AT THIS PARDON ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE BUT NON CREDIT FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE NO FEES FOR NON CREDIT IT'S FREE. FOR THIS TYPE OF NON CREDIT IT'S PAID AT THE SAME RATE AS CREDIT PROGRAMS BUT THE WAY WE COLLECT THE HOURS OF THAT WOULD BASICALLY WE BILL FOR IS DIFFERENT IT'S CALLED POSITIVE ATTENDANCE SO IN COMPETENCY BASED WORK YOU PROVIDE THE INSTRUCTION BOTH THE DIDACTIC- BOOK LEARNING AND THE- PERFORMANCE HANDS ON WORK. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF INSTRUCTION THE TO STUDENT NEEDS TO REACH THAT COMPETENCY LEVEL AND THE COMPETENCY LEVELS ARE AT A DEVELOP TO THROUGH THE SAME WAY FOR THESE NON CREDIT C. T. PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS. AND THE SAME FOR LABOR MARKET DEMAND BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WHEN THE STUDENT HAS COMPLETED THE COMPETENCIES SATISFIED THE PERFORMANCE THESE ARE MEASURABLE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES SOME ARE- CLASSROOM BASED SO MARK PERFORMANCE- ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK THAT THEY'LL BE EMPLOYED IN. THEIR DONE- WE'RE ONLY PAID FOR THE ACTUAL HOURS OF INSTRUCTION THAT THE STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN THE VISION. CORD OR STOP OUT AND BACK. WE GET PAID LESS HOURS SAME HOURLY IS BUT LESS HOURS THAT'S THE BASIS OF COMPETENCY. EXAMPLES IN THE HANDOUT THAT I GAVE FOR EXAMPLE OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN EMT AMBULANCE AMBULANCE DRIVERS. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLASSROOM PORTION OF THIS WHERE WE TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF BEING AN EMT WORKING WITH THE HEALTH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BUT WE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE BACK END OF AN AMBULANCE THAT SITS IN A LAB AT THE COLLEGE SO THEY ACTUALLY GET THE ON THE JOB TRAINING OF HOW TO WORK WITH SCENARIOS THAT THE- IMP EMPLOYERS. TWO TYPES OF EMPLOYERS THE FIRES- OF. THE FIRE INDUSTRY AND HOSPITALS ABOUT THE TYPE OF THINGS THEY WOULD INTERACT WITH ON THE ON THE RESCUED THE TRUCKS OR THE AMBULANCES. SO AGAIN MOST OF THESE SHORT TERM VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE SIX MONTHS OR LESS THEY'RE BASED ON CERTIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT GETS THE COMPETENCIES PASSES THE LICENSE EXAM AND GOES TO WORK. OUR PASS RATES ON INDUSTRY AND STATE CERTIFICATIONS ARE ALWAYS ABOVE TESTING THEM ON WHAT THEIR COMPETENCIES WILL BE AND THESE EXAMS. AND THE EMPLOYMENT RATES ARE ALSO THAT HIGH. WE LOOK FOR A MERGING OCCUPATIONS SO WE ADDED ONE FOR- AIRCRAFT DISPATCHERS THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO TALKED TO THE AIRPLANE WHEN YOU'RE ON SOUTHWEST AND THEY SAY I'M SORRY WE'VE GOT A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM HOLD UP. THAT'S THE DISPATCHER WAS TALKING TO THEM WE HAD OUR FIRST COURTED TWELVE PEOPLE PASSED THIS FAA CERTIFICATION IN A 100% EMPLOYMENT. YOU CAN SEE HOW THESE TYPES OF C. T. E. R. COMPETENCY BASED BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE HANDS ON WORK THEY DON'T LEND THEMSELVES TO ONLINE. WE'RE WORKING ON THE GRANT SYSTEM THAT'S OUT THERE FOR ONLINE- NOT CREDIT SEAT HE PROGRAMS PERHAPS CAN HAVE A DIDACTIC. PROGRAM ON THE LINE AND HAVE THE CHANCE WERE DONE WHERE DO IT NOW. WE NEED TO THE ELEMENTS THAT CAL. AS A WE SEE THAT THE THIS LEVEL ONLINE WOULD BE. AN A USEFUL. WITH US BUT I BILL. THAT OUR ECONOMY IS. AND COMPLEX ENOUGH THAT A STATE WIDE ONLINE SOLUTION IS NOT GOING TO CAPTURE THAT RANGE OF PROGRAMS IT MIGHT WORK IN WISCONSIN WHICH HAS A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FULL RANGE OF WHAT IS EXPECTED FOR CALIBRATE WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO THE TO THE AUDIENCE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THESE SHORT TERM VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAVE THREE MARKET SEC THE WE REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE MANY JUST STOPPED WORKING. AND THOSE WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED THEY'RE UP SPILLING AND THE THIRD IS THOSE ARE A NEW TO CALIFORNIA. THESE TEND TO BE A NON CREDIT THE ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS BUT CNA GOES TO A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE TO OUR AND ALL OF WHICH PROGRAMS WE HAVE WE HAVE AN OBSCURE RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. THE MTV IS A PRE REQUISITE TO A MEDIC. WHICH WE ALSO OFFER IN AND CLOSE TO A WORK AND THEN AND ROLE IN THE PART. I AM THIS BOTTLE THE LOCAL RESPONSE AND HANDS ON WORK IS NOT IN THE WHEEL HOUSE COULD BE AT LEAST. CAL. WOULD HAVE PAID PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL NINE STATE WHY. BUT THE REGION NATURE AND THE ON NATURE WILL. CALL FOR BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE MOUNT ST. THANK YOU DOCTOR YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA WAIT UNTIL QUESTIONS BUT CENTER JUST TWO OF US OF ME. OF FOR MY COLLEAGUE THE SAME COURTESY OF ME JUST ASK OF THESE ONE QUESTION ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS CAL BREDS REACH STATEWIDE WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN I THINK. TO ADDRESSING AND WITH REGARD TO THIS COMPETENCY COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION- COMPETENCY BASED INSTRUCTION. WITHIN THE REGION THAT YOU SERVICE. HAVE YOU- HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY FEEDBACK FROM THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY THAT THERE ARE ANY. A DEFICIENCIES IN IN THE PROGRAMMATIC OFFERINGS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR THOSE THAT ARE EMPLOYED IN NEED UPSCALING OR THOS THAT ARE COMING IN. TO THE EMPLOYMENT ARENA AND DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS YES WE CONSTANTLY MONITOR THAT AND WE FOUND THAT IN OUR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROGRAMS WE WEREN'T KEEPING UP WITH CURRENT COMPETENCIES. AND WE WERE A BIT AT A LOSS SO WE RECENTLY SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH GOODWILL INDUSTRIES WHICH IS A PROVEN INTERMEDIARY WITH INDUSTRY. AND THAT CONTRACT CALLS FOR THEM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO WORK WITH MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYERS IN THE GROWING MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN LOS ANGELES AND DO EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. TALK TO THEM DIRECTLY GET THE COMPETENCIES SEE WHAT THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT IS LIKE HELP US- WITH. THE CURRICULUM. I HAVE A POSITION THAT I'M READY TO FILL WITH THAT BUT I PUT THE STOP TO THAT TO SAY WE'RE NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS UNTIL WE HAVE A GOOD WAY OF RESPONDING. TO THAT AS WELL THE SECOND ANSWER IS THE CENTER FOR COMPETITIVE WORK FORCE THAT WE FUND THROUGH THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IS LOCATED IN A LAYSA PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE AND WORKFORCE INVEST BOARD AND THE LA CHAMBER COMMERCE. THEY DO OUT. ON AS I MENTIONED KEEPING UP WITH THE EVOLUTION OF SKILLS AND THEY DO REGULAR REPORTS THEY ARE ONLINE AND WE USE THOSE REPORTS TO UPGRADE OUR CURRICULUM ON A REGULAR BASIS IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT. IN THE AREA OF CTV. FOR YOUR RESPONSE A CENTER LEYVA I'VE TO TEAR OPEN UP QUESTIONS FORGERS JUST ONE QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE EIGHT ONLINE PROGRAMS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT OUR DO THOSE CAN THOSE STUDENTS- GET TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SUPPORT LIKE STUDENTS TO CALIBRATE CAN. YES WE HAVE FULLY ONLINE COUNSELING AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE INTO ITS INTEGRATED INTO THE PROGRAMS. AND WE HAVE- THE ABILITY TO HAVE WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- HOTLINE FOR ASSISTANCE A LOT OF THAT IS JUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF HOW TO INTERACT WITH. AND THEN WE HAVE BOTH- SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS CONNECTION WITH INSTRUCTORS IT'S ACTUALLY WRITTEN INTO THE CURRICULUM EVERY DISTANCE EDUCATION. PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE CURRICULUM PROCESS MUST ESTABLISH THE EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTORS STUDENT CON TO CONDUCT AND THAT'S A FACT LEE DRIVEN ISSUE RIGHT NONE. AND THEY- EVER EVERY TIME THE PROGRAM IS UPDATED OF THE COURSES UPDATED THE ASSURE THAT THAT KIND OF SUPPORT WHENEVER THE STUDENTS NEEDED IS AVAILABLE EITHER SYNCHRONOUSLY OR ASYNCHRONOUSLY. ALONG WITH THE COUNSELING IN THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AVAILABLE ONLINE MOSTLY SINCE THAT'S THE MECHANISM OF MATH OF CANVAS THAT WE USE TO INTERACT WITH STUDENTS SO TWO AM I PICK UP THE PHONE BONE THEIR SOME OF THEIR FOR ME TALK TO. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ASYNCHRONOUS YOU SEND A MESSAGE OUR STANDARD IS RESPONSE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BY THE FACULTY MEMBER AND IN THAT'S A COMMITMENT THAT FACULTY ENJOYED MEETING. GOOD THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH WHOSE NAME TIME I COULD GET A GREAT. HI MY NAME IS BRENT HOOKER I'M A SENIOR RESEARCH SPECIALIST ON THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION WITHIN THE ET DE THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT LABOR MARKET VALUE. AND THE DATA AVAILABLE IN OCCUPATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACADEMIC COURSEWORK WE DISCUSSED TODAY ON MEDICAL CODING IT SUPPORT. AS WELL AS COMPUTER INFORMATION SECURITY OCCUPATIONS. THE EASY USES A VARIETY OF WAYS OF ASSESSING LABOR MARKET VALUE WE USE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA- TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT OR THE QUARTERLY CENSUS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES WHICH IS BASICALLY A COMPREHENSIVE TABULATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES. FOR ALL WORKERS THAT ARE COVERED BY CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LAWS WE ALSO GET DATA FROM THE EDIE'S A BASE WAGE FILE WHICH GETS DATA FROM THE QUARTERLY REPORTS FROM EMPLOYERS THAT REPORT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO BE EATING. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED WAGES. THE ONE KEY RIGHT ARM PERSONAL% IDENTIFIER THAT WE USED TO LINK ALL OF THESE DATA SETS IS THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ANALYZE IT ON A PROGRAM COMPLETION BASIS WOULD GET THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OF PROGRAM COMPLETE EARNERS SO THEN WE CAN DO A LONGITUDINAL STUDY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES WHICH WOULD BE- WHETHER THEY WERE EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. INDUSTRY THEY'RE EMPLOYED IN AS WELL AS THE WAGES THEY'VE GARNISHED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN COMPLETING THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER METHOD WE YOU. TO ANALYZE EMPLOY DEMAND ACTUALLY IS A SOFTWARE TOOL ONLINE WE LOOK AT ONLINE JOB ADS AS A MEASURE OF EMPLOYER DEMAND AND WE USE A SOFTWARE TOOL- THROUGH THE CONFERENCE BOARD BURNING GLASS HELP WANTED ONLINE DATA SET. THIS DATA SAID ACTUALLY- SCREENS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND JOB DOMAINS THE TRADITIONAL JOB BOARDS AS WELL AS THE CORPORATE JOB BOARDS AS WELL AS THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES SO IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF EMPLOYER DEMAND ONLINE. WHEN WE GET A LINK BETWEEN ON WHEN WE'RE ANALYZING THE SKILLS THAT ARE IN DEMAND OF PROGRAM COMPLETE- SO WHAT THEY HAVE IN THIS CASE MEDICAL CODING CYBERSECURITY AND IT SUPPORT. WE LOOK AT THE JOB AT AND SEE IF THERE'S AN FOR ALL MATCH AND THEN WE MAKE GENERAL ASSESSMENT IF A PROGRAM HAS LABOR MARKET VALUE. ANOTHER DATA SOURCE WHO USES THE EDIE'S EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS WHICH ESTIMATES EMPLOYMENT CHANGES OVER TIME ON THE INDUSTRY IN OCCUPATIONAL LEVELS. AND THESE CHANGES CAN OCCUR THROUGH- INDUSTRY GROWTH WITHIN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. I'M I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE SIMPLE PROCESS IS THAT WE USE YOU CAN GET A MORE A BETTER FEEL FOR- HOW WE COME TO THESE OVERALL THE TERMINATIONS. IN TERMS OF- THE PROCESS WERE USING WE LOOK AT THE THREE PROGRAM AREAS AND AGAIN THOSE MEDICAL CODING I. T. SUPPORT AS WELL AS COMPUTER INFORMATION SECURITY. AND WE LINK THAT TO THE SIP CODE AND THE ZIP CODES ARE WHAT THE IS ACTUALLY THE CLASSIFICATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS. AND THEY ACTUALLY LINK A SPECIFIC CODE TO AN ACADEMIC AREA OF STUDY SO YOU CAN ANALYZE PROGRAM ACTIVITY IN PROGRAM COMPLETIONS AND MORE. IN A MORE SYSTEMATIC IN UNIFORM MANNER. WHEN WE HAVE THE ZIP CODE WE CAN LINK IT TO A SOCK CODE IN THE SOCK CODE IS BASED ON THE STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. WHICH IS THE FEDERAL STANDARD FOR- LINKING WORKERS TO A PARTICULAR OCCUPATION BASED ON THE TYPE OF JOB THEY DO. THAT ONCE WE HAVE THE SOCK CODE WE CAN LINK THIS TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS SO NOW IT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN- ACADEMIC AREA OF STUDY WE CAN LINK IT TO OCCUPATION SO MEDICAL CODING. THINK OF OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND MEDICAL RECORDS TECHNICIANS WHO WERE LOOKING AT COMPUTER INFORMATION SECURITY THINK ABOUT OCCUPATION SUCH AS IT SECURITY ANALYST AS WELL AS DATA SAID MINISTRY- AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT I. T. SUPPORT- CURRICULUM LOOK THINK ABOUT OCCUPATION SUCH AS COMPUTER SUPPORT SPECIALIST. WE TOOK THIS OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION THIS DIRECT AND GRANULAR LEVEL OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION AND LINK IT TO OUR EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS ARE EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS THAT WE USED. IN ANALYZING THESE COURSES WAS A TEN YEAR OCCUPANT EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS THAT WENT FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX. RIGHT HANDER HAVE BEEN FOR YOU. THE PEACE TO. AND SOME DETAILS FROM IT'LL GET INTO. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME SEE GROW THREE FOR THE I KEEP RAY FROM POINT TWO PER. TO TWENTY NINE TWO PER. HE ALSO SEE THAT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL WAGES NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE IN EXCESS OF THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THEN WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT THAT WAS ACTUALLY DISCUSSED TODAY ABOUT THE TOTAL JOB OPENINGS. WHEN WE'RE ANALYZING THEM WITH OUR EDT EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS IT'S THE SOME OF THREE DIFFERENT AREAS THE NEW JOBS CREATED BY EMPLOYERS. THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED FROM WORKERS EXITING A JOB SAY DUE TO RETIREMENT. ALSO THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED FROM EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS OUT OF THE JOB. SO THOSE ARE THE IT'S A IT'S A SUM UP ALL THREE OF THOSE IS THAT'S THE DATA THAT YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT THERE. IN TERMS OF BREAKING IT DOWN INTO THE THREE SPECIFIC AREAS. WE SAW THAT OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TOTAL JOB OPENINGS WERE RELATED TO COMPUTER INFORMATION SECURITY. EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TOTAL JOB OPENINGS RELATED TO IT SUPPORT. AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED JOB OPENINGS RELATED TO MEDICAL CODING WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL GROWTH RATES ARE THE WAGES ASSOCIATED IN THE JOB OPENINGS WE CAN GENERALLY STATE- THAT THE COURSE OFFERINGS TO HAVE LABOR MARKET VALUE. ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT WE LOOK AT THEN I DESCRIBE BRIEFLY WAS THE A JOB AT ANALYSIS WE DID A JOB AT ANALYSIS OVER THE SIXTY DAY PERIOD ENDING ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH USING THE COMFORTS BOARD BURNING GLASS HELP WANTED JOB DATA. FOUND THAT THERE WERE NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE CYBERSECURITY THE COMPUTER INFORMATION SECURITY JOB ADS STATE WIDE. FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MEDICAL CODING JOB ADS STATEWIDE. FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN IT SUPPORT JOB AT STATEWIDE SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL EMPLOYER DEMAND IN TEACHING IT IN A DATA DRIVEN MANNER WE'RE SEEING THAT THIS COURSE WORK DOES HAVE LABOR MARKET VALUE. AND IN CLOSING OF DVDS HELLO MY DE CAN CONDUCT ALL LONGITUDINAL OUTCOME STUDIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED BEFORE USING THE QUARTERLY CENSUS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES IN THE BASE WAGE FILE BUT THE KEY TO ACTUALLY DOING THIS DATA IS HAVING THAT GRANULAR LEVEL ALSO SECURITY NUMBER AS A PERSONAL IDENTIFIER THAT LINKS ALL THREE. SO L. U. D. DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONDUCT ALL TO THREE FORMS OF ANALYSIS THAT I LAID OUT. IN WE COULD DO THAT IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHAT DID HE DE DE PERFORM THE JOB MARKET ANALYSIS PER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE THREE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WAS CAL RIGHT. I THINK WE ARE WE DOING IT TODAY. THEY THEYWE'VE DONE THIS ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU WITH THIS THIS HANDOUT HERE- ALL THIS KIND OF DATA WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS- ANALYSIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA WORK FOR SPORT. BUT I HAVE NO INDIVIDUAL KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE EDT AND CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE WELL THEN MY OTHER QUOTE I'VE ACTUALLY I'VE GOT A COUPLE BUT THIS ANALYSIS IS STATEWIDE DO YOU DO YOUR DOES YOUR SYSTEM HAVE THE ABILITY AND DO YOU. BREAK THIS DOWN BY REGION YEAH WE ACTUALLY BREAK IT DOWN BY METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS COUNTIES SO THERE BE A SACRAMENTO MSA ALSO WE HAVE THE METROPOLITAN DIVISION AREAS. IN THESE ARE ALL FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR- BREAKING DOWN INFORMATION ON A REGIONAL LEVEL. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATES AND EMPLOYABILITY. IT'S ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. IT'S ANOTHER TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STATEWIDE STATISTICS BUT SOMEBODY WITH A CERTIFICATE WHO LIVES IN HEMET CALIFORNIA. IF THE JOB IS IN THE BAY AREA. AND THEY HAVE A FAMILY MAKES IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FILL THE JOB SO SOME TO AT SOME POINT THIS WHOLE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE. REGIONALIZED WHICH PROBABLY SPEAKS TO. WHAT LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS DO VIS A VIS THE CALIBRATE PROGRAM BUT- THAT'S NOT THAT'S JUST ANOTHER PANEL. THE RIVER OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR MOTION SIR. SIR COULD I JUST INTERJECT THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF DATA THAT WE EXPECT COLLEGES TO DO TO LOOK AT THE REGIONAL DATA IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. EMPLOYABILITY IN THE LEVEL OF ATTAINMENT OF SKILL IS A IS A CERTIFICATE OKAY IS IT JUST ONE COURSE. IS IT- A DEGREE OR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT GLORIA TO CREATE THEIR DIFFERENT LEVELS THERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE- SEPT CODE. THAT IS USED TO FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT. OF CURRENT CURRICULAR PROCESSES OF THE COLLEGES. MS ROSENBERG IS ISSUE ME OKAY. WELL ABOVE AN ISLAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM BUT- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS FOR INCLUDING US IN A CONVERSATION. WE'RE ALWAYS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO OUR WORKERS EXPERIENCE AND PERSPECTIVE- AS YOU MAY KNOW SEIU REPRESENTS SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- WE GAUGE ON AN ISSUE IT IS WITH THE INPUT OF ALL SEVENTEEN OF OUR LOCALS. THROW ONE VOICE APPROACH OUR INVOLVEMENT HOW BRIGHT IS NO DIFFERENT- I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY BEFORE I DIVE IN THAT- SCA YOU WORK WE'RE PROUD ADVOCATES AND WERE STRONG ADVOCATES- EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE SUPPORT FOR THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MINUTES CALIBRATE. IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT FILLS A UNIQUE AND LARGELY ON MATT ROLE IN THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SEVERE- S. YEAH YOU INITIALLY BECAME ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION AFTER LOCAL UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS USE W. SUGGESTED WE CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL. THERE'S A HUGE SHORTAGE OF ALLIED HEALTH CARE WORK CALIFORNIA AND THAT SHORTAGE IS GROWING AT A PIECE OF THE STATE IS NOT MEETING- WHEN WE BROUGHT THE PROPOSAL TO OUR LEADERSHIP HOWEVER WE LEARN THE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR LOCAL. HASA DEMAND FOR SHORT TERM SHORT FOR TREATING AND CERTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO ME THEY'RE LOOKING TO PRIVATE SECTOR TED TO SECURE THAT EDUCATION AND- THAT THE DEMAND IS OUTPACING OUR ABILITY TO FILL IT- SO FOR INSTANCE OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS THEY REQUIRE A NUMBER. OF TICKETS IN TRAINING US DOES THE EARLY LEARNING CERTIFICATE AND LEAD TEACHER TRAINING WE'VE HAD TO UTILIZE PRIVATE PROGRAMS TO GET THAT RECKLESS TRAINING OUR CLASS OF THE WORKERS AT THE NEED A BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION. TATIAN TRAINING- THAT'S OFTEN REQUIRED WITH IT PEAS WE WERE ABLE PART WITH L. U. S. D. TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR A PILOT. AND THAT SMALL IT'S LIMITED IT'S- ONLY LOCALIZA CERTAIN PARTS OF LA AND ULTIMATELY HOW TO UTILIZE A. SAMPLES I CAN PROVIDE BUT I FOR THE SAKE OF TIME LIMITED THAT- WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIBRATE WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AS IT WAS ENVISIONED- THE OPPORTUNITY WE SEE IN COBB RIGHT IN THE SUPPORT WE HAVE GIVEN TO THE CONCEPT. IS THAT IT IS A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE FROM THAT OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN AND WE KNOW THAT SOME COMMUTING COLLEGES ARE WE UNDERSTAND IF THEY OFFER THAT TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION- AND THAT THE YEAH I MIGHT HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM AS WELL BUT- OUR LOCALS OF EXPRESS THAT THEY NEED A MORE EXPENSIVE. A MORE ACCESSIBLE IN A TARGETED EDUCATION PATHWAY BY SUPPORTING HOW BRIGHT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH THE TRADITIONAL COLLEGE STRUCTURE OR THE- WE I PROGRAM. WE SUPPORT STUDENTS ARE PRACTICALLY EVERY TRADITIONAL COLLEGE AND- III BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE WORKERS LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH PROGRAMS MEET WORKERS WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT INCLUDES THAT WE AYE PROGRAM. AND WILL KNOW IT SINCE THE CONVERSATION AROUND COPY AND- YEAH I AS VASTLY IMPROVED WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A COINCIDENCE- MANY OF OUR LOCALS HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT. ARIENS AN EXPANSION OF PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE YEAH I AND WE DO APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS ENCOURAGING AND HOPE FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS- BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT OUR LOCAL HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY'VE EXPAND THE USE OF YEAH I IS STILL FOR PRE REQUISITES AND STILL FOR TRADITIONAL TWO AND FOUR YEAR DEGREES- SO AGAIN WE DON'T SEE EVEN IF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF OVERLAP. THE TRACKS ARE USUALLY PRETTY DIFFERENT WITH THEIR LOOKS SEEKING HOW BRIGHT AND WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING IN THE ON THE BRICK AND MORTAR AND- WE I. DID THE CURRENT OF COMMITTEE CALLED INCIDENT ON BOTH IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A STREAMLINED APPROACH FOR PARTNERSHIP- NOT ONLY STATEWIDE BUT EVEN LOCALLY- FOR INSTANCE YOU AGE YOU WHICH IS JUST NUMBERS. BECAUSE AS I OVER HUNDRED AND TEN. TAX WHEN. CAN'T TURN HIGH. PROSTOCKS NEXT TO FORCE THE MAN'S DOES DUE TO TIME YOU WOULD WAS ON TO PARTNER WITH CAL RIGHT FOR THEM PROBE BUT WE ARE MOVING WITH THE DEATH TRAINING PROVIDER WHICH I KNOW A I'M HASN'T ABOUT G. ILL THEY A PROGRAM RUNNING OFF GROUND WE WERE YU FINDS A CENTER WORKERS TO PRIVATE INTO FOR PROFIT SO WE THOUGHT- A NONPROFIT LARGER PROGRAMMING WAS STILL A BETTER ALTERNATIVE ULTIMATELY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PUBLIC OPTION- WE KNOW THAT HOW BRIGHT HAS MEDICAL COOKING UP AND RUNNING AND IF WE COULD. COURTNEY EFFORTS I DON'T THINK WE WOULD ROLL OUT UTILIZING THEM. WE ARE SELLING GAUGING AT U. H. W. SPECIFICALLY- IS WORKING WITH THEM TO SEE IF THERE'S A BETTER PATHWAY TO MOVE FORWARD- YOU KNOW OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING WE BELIEVE THAT COOPERATE IN THE CONCEPT BEHIND THEIR INSTITUTION IS A NEEDED ONE WITHIN OUR WORK FORCE- AND MY CLOSING DOES TIE BACK TO WAY. DR PAN RAISED AND WHAT THE ET SPOKE TO WHICH I FIND TROUBLING- AND HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR US IS THAT WHEN WE FIRST DISCUSSED HOW BRIGHT WE LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR LOCAL THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED. AND WE PROBABLY REPRESENT LOW WAGE WORKERS THEY DO WHAT JOB THAT'S NEEDED- AND THEY ALSO DESERVE OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY DESERVE- TO FIND AFFORDABLE PUBLIC OPTION RATHER THAN HAVING TO TURN TO PRIVATE SECTOR- BUT THE SUCCESS METRIC METRICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. THEY LEAVE THEM OUT. SO WITH THE FOR INSTANCE THE CLASSIFIED WORKER AT THE WOULD RECEIVE A MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING. ON THE CUSP OF POVERTY WAGES SO 5% WOULD BE A MORE STABLE HOME LIFE FOR THEIR FAMILY. IT ALSO WOULD BE IN HOUSE A LOT OF WORK FOR CONTRACTING OUT. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A GOOD INVESTMENT PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT ALSO IS A GOOD INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC AFTER WE WOULD IT HURRY NEARLY. SIX MONTHS YOU ALSO CA. IS THE EMPLOYER A GOOD EMPLOYER ARE THEY A PULP. EMPLOYER ARE THE EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED DO THEY HAVE BENEFITS. THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED- AND NOT JUST WE JUST ALONE ALTHOUGH WE DO THINK LEADERS ARE STRONG INDICATOR- SO WE URGE THAT THE GOAL SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FOR GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. WE ARE SUPPOSE BUT WE ARE SUPPORTED BE COLLEGES AND WERE SUPPORT ABOUT. BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THAT USED TO BE. WORKERS AND MEETING. THEY ARE HOWEVER. IS MISINTERPRETED I THINK THERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET WORKERS WERE THERE. AT THE WE- SURE THAT WE GIVE WERE HEY UP. THEMSELVES BOTH FOR THEMSELVES IN THEIR AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO THINK SOME THE ISSUE. IS HOW WE STRUCTURE THIS. AND WHETHER WE SPEND TWELVE MONTHS. OUT WHO THE PRESIDENT IS AND HIRING THIRTY ONE ADMINISTRATORS OR WHETHER WE SPEND OUR TIME PUTTING COURSES ON THE GROUND AND LINING UP EMPLOYERS- I THINK THE IDENTITY OF THE EMPLOYERS. IS STILL AN ISSUE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WE'RE SCA USE INVOLVED IN SCA THOSE CONTRACTS YOU KNOW YOUR PLAYERS ARE. AND WE KNOW IF A LABOR ORGANIZATION CAN GATHER UP WORKERS WHO NEED. ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR UP SKILLING. AND CAN WORK WITH THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY WORK WITH ON A DAILY BASIS. THERE'S SOME CONNECTIVITY THERE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER COMMENTS I MADE. IS THE LACK OF CONNECTIVITY WITH THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY SEIU. WHO DON'T HAVE EXISTING CONTRACTS BETWEEN LABOR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR EMPLOYER. CAN CONNECT THEM. WITH THE CERTIFICATE TO SOME NEW. A SKILLED JOB AND I THINK WE NEED WE NEED A LITTLE WORK ON THAT THE QUESTION IS DOES THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DO THAT. THEN THE PATH READING DOWN AS SHE THAT OR DO WE NEED TO PIVOT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT MY POSITION ON ALL THIS IS CLEAR BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT. AS UUAL BUT I MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT THE LOW WAGE WORKERS ABSOLUTELY SIR OR ARE SHORT TERM- VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE NON CREDIT COMPETENCY BASED NO FEES. OFTEN TARGET THE ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE IN HIGH DEMAND LIKE HOME HEALTH CARE WORKER AND- CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT. BOB BUT WE SEE THAT THOSE WHO COME TO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE- DOES YOUR MID LIFE- MAYBE HAD NOT HAD ANY FORMAL TRAINING. THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE THERE THEY WANT TO ADD A WAGE TO A FAMILY INCOME THAT RIGHT MAKES THE FAMILY INCOME LIVABLE WAGE. AND IN LA COUNTY- IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT IT TAKES MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS TO PRODUCE A LIVABLE WAGE. A SO WE FEEL THAT- THE RESPONSE WE'RE GETTING FROM THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THOSE JOBS. FIRST OF ALL THAT THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FAMILY INCOME. IT'S THE PRICE OF HAVING A JOB IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE FAMILY IN THE COMMUNITY AND SECONDLY THEY DO COVER THEM TELLS THE PARTY TO LEARN THAT THEY MAY HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED BEFORE. AND AS I MENTIONED MOST OF THESE ARE ENTRY LEVEL BUT THE CAN CALL PROVIDE AND STEP IN THE LAN AND WE- KILLED RATE OF ABOUT 8% I WOULDN'T NEGLECT THE SKILL WORK. IN THE TO. PROTOCOL WITH SEEM TO BE AT A LITTLE WEIGHT FOR THIS JOB. BEING A ACE OF A OF THE OLD. US I'M GOING FROM GOING FOR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR AN INVITING US TO BE HERE TODAY- I'M BOB WINTER CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION DIRECTOR- WE REPRESENT THE FORTY FIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ABOUT ANOTHER SEVENTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN ADVANCING AND SUPPORTING LOCAL AND REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND JOB TRAINING. THE JOB SEEKERS THAT COME TO THE CAREER CENTER SYSTEM OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE MANY OF THE FOLKS WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY THEY REPRESENT TARGET POPULATIONS FROM. VETERANS AN EX OFFENDERS AND FOSTER YOUTH TO LONG ERM UNEMPLOYED AND PEOPLE ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND- THE MORE THAN 20% OF OUR POPULATION LIVE AT OR BELOW POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE THE WORKING POOR I WAS ASKED TODAY TO DESCRIBE RELATIONSHIPS AND- EFFORTS BETWEEN LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO. I'M GONNA COVER FIVE AREAS OF THE STATE I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION. LOS RIOS COLLEGE. HAS INVESTED IN THE SACRAMENTO EMPLOYMENT TRAINING ADMINISTRATION THE WORK FORCE BOARD HERE UNDER THE STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE. TO PAY FOR PROVIDE THREE COACHES FROM THE SACRAMENTO WORKFORCE BOARD ON SITE AT LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE THOSE COACHES FOCUS ON CONNECTING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS STUDENTS AND GRADUATES. DIRECTLY TO EMPLOYERS AND DEMANDED ST OCCUPATIONS BOTH BEFORE THEY START THE PROGRAM AND AFTER COMPLETION SO THEY DO THE PLACEMENT FUNCTION ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ADDITIONALLY THE WORK FORCE BOARDS IN THE REGION HERE ALONG WITH THE REGIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I INVESTED IN AND SUPPORTED- THE CREATION OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY MANUFACTURING INITIATIVE. WHICH WORKS WITH EDUCATORS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS PROACTIVELY DEVELOP. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WORKFORCE INITIATIVE PROGRAMS LEADING TO FOR FILLING MANUFACTURING CAREER PATHS THROUGH THE REGION HERE. CURRENTLY THEY'RE WORKING ON A CNC MACHINIST APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH UTILIZES CURRICULUM CERTIFICATES DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MANUFACTURER ASSOCIATION HERE IN THE REGION AND THE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT SAID TO THE EAST BAY. IN THE EAST BAY REGION THE CITY OF OAKLAND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PARTNERS WITH LANEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ALONG WITH THE OAKLAND IN THE ALLIANCE AND WHOLE FOODS AND A ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CALLED RALPH J. BUNCHE SHE ACADEMY. A CULINARY CAREER PATHWAY PROGRAM FOR OPPORTUNITY YOUTH STUDENTS RECEIVE PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING AND INTERNSHIPS AND UPON COMPLETION OF THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THEY ENTERED THE CULINARY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. LAINEY COLLEGES THE EDUCATION AND TO EIGHT AND THE OAKLEY INDIA THE OAKLAND INDIA ALLIANCE IS AN ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF OVER EIGHTY RESTAURANTS WHICH ARE THE EMPLOYER SPONSORS FOR THE REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE YOUR AREA. THE WORK FORCE BOARDS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE ARE PART OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE LAUNCH WHICH STANDS FOR LOCAL APPRENTICESHIPS UTILIZING A NETWORK OF COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS IT'S A BIG ACRONYM LAUNCHES THE INLAND EMPIRE'S APPRENTICESHIP NETWORK IT'S A GROWING NETWORK OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES HIGH SCHOOL AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING THIS A SYSTEM WIDE APPROACH. IN OFFERING APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE REGIONS I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHY REGIONAL WELL FROM OUR EXPERIENCE BUSINESSES AND JOB SEEKERS COMMUTE AND WORK AND RECRUIT TALENT REGIONALLY. THE LAUNCH INITIATIVE- AND THE WORK FORCE BOARD RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE JAMES IRVINE FOUNDATION AND A COUPLE THIS WITH THEIR STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE IN THE TITLE ONE DOLLARS. TO BUILD THIS LAUNCH INITIATIVE. ADDITIONALLY THE IN TECH CENTER- PAT CHAFEE COLLEGE WORKS WITH THE WORK FORCE BOARDS TO DEVELOP PRE APPRENTICESHIP AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS- AND THEY SERVE THE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN THE REGION- REGIONAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. UNDER THE WORKFORCE RATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES ACT HAVE BEEN USED TO SUPPORT CHAFEE COLLEGE TO EXPECT A NUMBER OF COHORTS THAT ARE BEING TRAINED IN IN TECH CENTER. IN THE LA BASIN. THE LOS ANGELES WORKSOURCE CENTERS ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES INCLUDING LA TRADE TACK LA CITY COLLEGE AND THE LA VALLEY COLLEGE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS BIG AND LOS ANGELES VALLEY AS IT IS IN THE REST OF THE STATE. ORDINATOR IN CASE MANAGERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY SPECIALTY AREAS IN LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTY TO ADDRESS THIS NEED THE BOARDS IN LA AND INVENTOR A LED BY THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES WORKFORCE BOARD COLLABORATED WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE AND THE EIGHT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN LA. TO DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE FOR CARE COORDINATION SKILLS ALLIANCE THE ALLIANCE DEVELOPED CARE COORDINATION PATHWAY TRAININGS THAT ARE NOW ARTICULATED TO THE PUBLIC. AND THEIR TRAINING AND THREE LEVELS PATIENT NAVIGATOR CARE COORDINATOR AND CARE MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THE SOUTH BAY WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS PARTNERED WITH WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE GENERAL FIVE THOUSAND APPRENTICES. AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP AT PRE APPRENTICES INTO THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING OCCUPATION SERVING THE AEROSPACE AND BIOSCIENCE SECTOR. UPON RECEIVING A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FOR OVER FOUR YEARS THE WORK FORCE FOR THEIR WORK WITH EL CAMINO COLLEGE IN THE COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. ALONG WITH THEM PLAYERS AT THE TABLE WHICH INCLUDE AEROJET ROCKETDYNE. IMPRESS AEROSPACE IBM LOCKHEED MARTIN NORTHROP GRUMMAN TESLA AND PANASONIC ENERGY. FINALLY THIS HAPPENS- ALSO IN RURAL AREAS OF OUR STATE- UP IN THE GREAT MOTHER LODE- THE MOTHER LODE JOB TRAINING- ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE WORK FORCE FOR THEIR- FORMED A CO LOCATION AGREEMENT A PARTNERSHIP CALLED THE AMADOR PROSPERITY CENTER. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE AMADOR COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE AMADOR COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY THE TOURISM COUNCIL AND COLUMBIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE WORKFORCE BOARD THEY'RE LOCATED THEIR CAREER CENTER RIGHT IN THE PROSPERITY CENTER AT COLUMBIA COLLEGES OFFERING CLASSES AT THE CAREER CENTER- AT THE PROSPERITY CENTER. THEIR FOCUS CURRENTLY IS THE HEALTH CARE SAID AND THIS IS THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE FOUR HOSPITALS IN THE REGION. AND THEN FINALLY THE COLLEGE OF THE REDWOODS UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS WORKED WITH THE HUMBLE COUNTY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO WORK WITH HIM VARIOUS EMPLOYERS AND DEVELOPING TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO MEET INDUSTRY DEMAND. AND THESE INCLUDE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WORKPLACE SAFETY PHLEBOTOMY TRUCK DRIVING CERTIFICATION PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN. MANY THESE FUNDS HAVE COME TO THE AREA THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S DISCRETIONARY MONEY AS LAW AS WELL AS A STRONG WORK FORCE INITIATIVE. SO THOSE ARE JUST FIVE OF MANY EXAMPLES THAT I HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP TO WORK FOR SPORTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO IN TECH IS IN THE HEART OF MY DISTRICT AND WE LOVE IN TECH WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THEM. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT WHOLE FOODS WHAT IS YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND- WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THEM SO THE WORKFORCE BOARD IN- OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. IS WORKING WITH- WHOLE FOODS. AS ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM FOR- THE CULINARY APPRENTICESHIP CELL WHOLE FOODS SITS ON- THE EMPLOYER SPONSORED PART OF THAT JOINT APPRENTICESHIP COMMITTEE THEY OVERSEE THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT MAKE SURE THE CURRICULUM MEETS THEIR NEEDS. AND MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THEY'RE ONE OF THE OVER EIGHTY RESTAURANTS AND FOOD SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEN HIRE PEOPLE INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BUT I COULD DOUBLE BACK AROUND TO FIND OUT FOR YOU JUST CURIOUS COMING OUT OF- ORGANIZED GROCERY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE SOMEONE ISN'T SPENDING TIME. GETTING A CERTIFICATE OR WHAT NOT TO WORK AT WHOLE FOODS WHEN YOU COULD GO WORK FOR UNION EMPLOYER WALK IN AND HAVE. A GOOD WAGE BENEFITS AND A PENSION SO THAT'S JUST MY POINT. THAT'S. JIM MILLER I'M PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS I'M ALSO A FACULTY MEMBER AT SAN DIEGO CITY COLLEGE- SO I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AIDS MUCH LIKE GREATLY APPRECIATED ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THE REPORTS AND MATERIALS THEY PROVIDED FOR THE HEARING IT'S FANTASTIC ANY OBJECTIVE PERSON THAT WOULD JUST READ THROUGH THE MATERIALS WOULD SEE NO NEED FOR CAL BRIGHT I THINK IT JUST MAKES THE CASE ON ITS OWN JUST BY READING THROUGH IT- AND WE'VE BEEN POSED TO CALIBRATE SINCE IT WAS FIRST DISCUSSED AND WE'VE BEEN VERY VERY VOCALLY OPPOSED. TO IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS- I WANTED TO DISPEL A FEW MINUTES THAT WERE- MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY ON THE LEGISLATURE REALLY PER SUPPORTED CAL RIGHT EITHER WHEN IT WAS IN CONCEIVED LOBBIED FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO FIND ONE PERSON IN SUPPORT REASON IT CAME INTO BEING IS GOVERNOR BROWN. ALBRIGHT OUT AND SO PUT IT IN THE BUDGET BILL. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT NOW IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WENT THROUGH REGULAR POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS LIKE. NORM NORMALLY BILLS WOULD AND IT'S MY GUESS HAD THAT BEEN THE CASE IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DIED IN THE FIRST HEARING WHICH IS WHY I END UP IN THE BUDGET BILL. SO WE'RE STUCK WITH SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR BROWN REALLY WANTED BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY WANTED IT OR EVER SUPPORTED AT ANY POINT IN TIME- I WANTED TO TALK ON. TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF DUPLICATION. IT'S A BIG POINT A BONE OF CONTENTION AMONG US MOMENTS FACULTY OF THE SENATE AS WELL- THE STATUTES SUPER CLEAR. THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE DUPLICATING THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT NEED A LOT OF EXTRA DEFINITION AS TO WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS AND- WHEN WE PRESS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON THIS THE BEST WE CAN GET BACK FROM THEM WAS. WELL IT'S A TERM OF ART. WHAT IS THAT MEAN. DUPLICATION IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE WORD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANS IN. A TO GIVE YOU A SET THAT SIMILAR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A- MODEL BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PART OF THEIR- STATUTE OR THERE ARE. RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE ANY PROGRAMS AND SEE AS YOU ARE YOU SEE AND GUESS WHAT. NOT THEY'VE GOT THIRTEEN UNIQUE PROGRAMS AREN'T BEING RUN ANYWHERE ELSE. SO THESE THREE PROGRAM MEDICAL CODING. CYBERSECURITY AND FORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE FIFTY ONE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT OFFER THOSE PROGRAMS. OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN ACCREDITED COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIFTY ONE. SO IT'S NOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DUPLICATION IT'S A LOT OF DUPLICATION AND THE REASON WHY THOSE FIFTY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OFFERING THOSE PROGRAMS. IS BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE RESEARCH THAT MR HOOKER- ALLUDED TO THAT THERE'S JOBS THERE THAT THE IT DOES OUR FIELDS WHERE WE NEED TO YOU KNOW TRAIN STUDENTS TO GET. JOBS WE DON'T OFFER PROGRAMS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF WE DON'T SEE. ANY NEED FOR THEM RIGHT WE DO THESE RESURGENT DOCTORS GASKETS MENTION THIS AS WELL DOCTOR SCROGGINS THAT WE DO THIS RESEARCH LOCALLY WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THE JOB MARKET ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND WHAT PROGRAMS WE NEED TO PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE STUDENT NEEDS WERE DOING THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS IT'S WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT. IT THERE'S A REASON WORK CALLED COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE WERE CONNECTED TO OUR COMMUNITIES- THE OTHER POINT ABOUT. FOR PERHAPS THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR OF ONE OF THOSE FIFTY ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WANT TO TAKE THIS PROGRAM. FROM SOME RURAL AREA OR SOME REMOTE AREA OR SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE A CALIFORNIA EVEN. ANY PROGRAM BE ACCESSED BY ANY STUDENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THERE AREN'T GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES FOR ONLINE AT ANY STUDENT CAN TAKE ANY ONLINE COURSE FOR MANY COLLEGE. NO MATTER WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE LOCATED. SO THERE'S NO BARRIER. AMONG THE CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS THAT JUST DOESN'T EXIST. THE POINT WAS MADE ABOUT ACCREDITATION IF YOU RECALL SOME YEARS BACK WE HAD A BIG FIGHT AMONG IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THE ACC JC. WHEN THERE ARE A CREDITOR BEFORE THERE WAS A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY WERE UNFAIRLY YOU KNOW SANCTIONING SOME OF OUR COLLEGES AT CETERA. AND NOW WE HEAR AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS A MOVEMENT TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT A CREDITOR TO GET OUTSIDE OF THE CJC AND WE WERE TOLD NO ALL THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE IN WINE ACCREDITING BODY WE COULDN'T HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE OR TWO DIFFERENT CREDITORS. AND NOW HERE THE ONLINE COLLEGE THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR OWN A CREDITOR SO NOT ONLY DO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW AND IN IN OTHER AREAS BUT NOW ITS ACCREDITATION AS WELL IF YOU READ THROUGH THE PACKET. THEY WEREN'T IN COMPLIANCE WITH A 50% LAW NO WE DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THAT BUT NOW THEY DO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THAT SO THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS THEM JUST. YOU KNOW BALLING DISREGARDING WHAT DISPATCH STATE THERE'S A SENSE THAT THE ONLINE CALLS FOR SOME REASON DOESN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL THE SAME RULES THE REST OF US FOLLOW AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COMES FROM. OR NO WAY BUT THE BASIS IS ON THAT- CONTRACT WAS MENTIONED. WE CON THROUGHOUT THE CAN CALL DOES AS WE SO FELT WE ALSO A FAN A- WE GONNA SET THAT UP THE PARTY COMPANY. ON SOME TAKE TRAINING PROGRAM IT'S NOT IN OUR- YOU CURRY. LET TO SAY YOU GOT A BY COMPANY AT ONE TO. DO SOME EXTRA TRAINING FOR THEIR CHEMISTS WE DO THAT WE THAT NOW WILL SEND A CHEMISTRY FACULTY MEMBER AND WILL WORK OUT A CONTRACT WITH THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE THAT TRAINING MAYBE IT'S A WEEK MAYBE IT'S TEN WEEKS WHATEVER TIME THE COMPANY WANTS. AND WE YOU KNOW A KIND WITH THEM TO BRAND WE'RE OUT AND WE'VE PROVIDED THAT SERVICE TO THAT WORKPLACE WE DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS I'M- AND IF YOU ALSO LOOK THROUGH THE- HANDBOOK THEIR- WERE OF THE MID. HERE PER. WE THIS ONLINE AND INITIATIVE THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT UNDER FUNDED IF WE COULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO THAT. WE COULD GROW THAT AND MAKE THAT INTO A MUCH MORE ROBUST PRO PROGRAM. AND NO ONE MENTIONED THE ENGINE A LITTLE BIT THE NUMBERS BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THEM. THAT EVEN WITH THE NEW NUMBERS THAT WE WERE TOLD THIS MORNING THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE- CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE. AND MAYBE A COUPLE HUNDRED IN THE PIPELINE TOWARDS ENROLLMENT THERE- KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE IN THE REGULAR TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. WE DON'T GET TO COUNT OR GET FUNDED FOR STUDENTS THAT DON'T ENROLL IN A CLASS SO FOR STUDENT TAKES A- KOREAN I'D TAKES A- PLACEMENT EXAM OR GOES TO AN ORIENTATION SESSION. OR MEET WITH A COUNSELOR AND THEN THEY DON'T ON ROLE WE DON'T GET ANY REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT WE DON'T GET ANY MONEY FOR THAT THE ONLY STUDENTS WE COUNT. ARE THE ONES AND ROLLED SO IF YOU COUNT THE ONES AND ROLLED AND CAL BRIGHT. THIRTY EIGHT. IT'S THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER PERSON WERE SPENDING FOR THOSE THIRTY EIGHT STUDENTS. AND AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER CHAIR ROTH. WE HAVE A- YOU KNOW NOMENCLATURE OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS WHICH IS HOW ARE FUNDING ACTUALLY ROLLS OUT. SO IF YOU CONVERT YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ONE CLASS AT THEY'RE TAKING. ON AN FTL. IT'S A THIRTY SEVEN BILLION. PER FULL TIME. AND MONEY LET'S PULL ONE TIME MONEY OUT IT'S STILL FIVE THREE MAY. DOLLARS PER FTS THAT WE'RE SPENDING THERE. SO THE COLLEGES GET ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND TIMES LESS. PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT IN THE CALPERS GETTING. SO IF YOU COULD JUST LIKE DOUBLE OUR RESOURCE WE WOULD BE IN GREAT SHAPE. RIGHT NOT WE ARE ASKING THAT YOU RAISE A BY A THOUSAND TIMES JUST DOUBLE THAT AND THEN WE'D BE IN GREAT SHAPE BECAUSE IF YOU COMPARE THE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO UC'S CSU. AND PRISONS WERE WAY AT THE BOTTOM EVERYONE GETS MORE FUNDING THAN WE DO PER PUPIL SO. THAT'S REALLY THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM. IT'S THE DRAMATIC UNDER FUNDING OUR DRASTIC UNDERFUNDING OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IF THERE WAS MORE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM WE COULD EXPAND IN ALL OF THESE AREAS. AND JUST WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE AND WE ARE YOU SEE ON THIS PAPER THAT IN THE PACKET. NINETY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE ALREADY BEEN SERVED THROUGH THAT PROGRAM AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. AND IF YOU READ THROUGH THE- OTHER OVERVIEW ON PAGE SEVENTEEN IT TALKS ABOUT BECAUSE I'M FROM SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO CONTINUING THAT. WE'VE PUT TOGETHER PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME PROGRAM. AS CAL BRIGHT FOR FRACTION OF THE COST THE SAME OPEN ENTRY OPEN EXIT IT'S FREE TO EVERYBODY. SAME TYPES OF DEGREES AND EVERYTHING CAL BRIGHT IS DOING. IN HOUSE AND AS WE SAID SINCE THE VERY FIRST MEETING ON THIS. THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE THE SEPARATE ENTITY IT'S NOT SERVING ANY PURPOSE THAT WE CAN'T ALREADY SERVE WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE WISE. TO TAKE THESE RESOURCES AND REDEPLOY THEM IN SUCH A WAY. THAT WE GET. WE HAPPEN TO THE ALREADY A- MY MORE. SINCE IN THAT HAVE IN PLACE. THROUGH THE OTHER HUNDRED AND FOUR. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK IT GOES TO THE QUESTION SEVENTY ASK AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS TO AND- TO DO IT WOULD. IT AND UNDERSERVED. BEEN OUT THERE IF THE RESEARCH POPULATION IN OUT STRUCTURE. BUT YOU CAN AND SET UP THIS OF OBJECTIVES AND METRIC SO WE CAN MEASURE SUCCESS IF THERE IS AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION AND YOU SPREAD THE MONEY OUT THEN THE QUESTION IS IMMEASURABLE AND CAN WE DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE USE OF OUR FUNDS SO THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT. QUESTIONS BUT ALL OF THEM FINAL BACK TO THE FIRST POINT WHICH IS THERE AN UNDERSTAND UNSERVED OF CADRE OF- POTENTIAL STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY THE CURRENT SYSTEM. CAN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM MODIFIED TO SERVE THEM OR WE DO WE NEED TO SET UP AN AS WE HAVE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE TO DO SO. SORT OF COMPLICATED ALL OF US I THINK HAVE THE SAME GOAL AND OBJECTIVE OVERALL WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE EDUCATION TO STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY GET A PRODUCT THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM. ALL ALL IF NOT ALWAYS IS A GOOD PAYING JOB SO. OBSERVE QUESTIONS AUGUST ANYTHING FURTHER PANELISTS WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELLO SIR WE COULD I COMMENT ON THE ACCREDITATION YES SIR. TWO JUST SO YOU YOU HEARD US TALK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. NOW AND READ. ACCREDITATION BUT WE NEVER REALLY TOLD YOU WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS COMPLETELY. THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S ONE OF THEM IS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE A- GOOD OF. A DEGREE IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN GENERAL STUDIES. IS THAT CORRECT ACTUALLY IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT I FIGURED. THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS THE- ENTITY THAT RECOGNIZES NATIONALLY CREDITORS. ND THEY THEY ARE SPECIALIZED CREDITORS PROGRAM BASIC CREDITORS FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS ONE THAT HAS THE SOLE MISSION TO A CREDIT. ONLINE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE NATION WISCONSIN HAS ONE. THAT NATIONAL ACCREDITATION CREW IS WHAT CHANCELLOR OAKLEY WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR- AGENCY SO WOULD NOT NOT BE A REGIONAL IT WOULD BE- AT A US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DEALING WITH THE REGULATIONS AND PROCESS THE LIMITATIONS ON NATIONAL VERSUS LOCAL. IS THAT THE CREDITS EARNED BY CAL BRIDE ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY OTHER COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA NOT CSU NOT UC NOT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE CAN ONLY ACCEPT UNITS FROM REGIONALLY EC ACCREDITED- COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SO IF SOMEONE DROPPED OUT OF THAT CODING CLASS. AND WANTED TO USE THE CREDITS THAT THEY HAD EARNED TWO COMPLETED AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT WOULDN'T BE PERMISSIBLE. COULD TALKING BUT STRANDED CERTIFICATE HOLDERS AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY STRANDED WORKERS YES THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT THE CURRENT. MODEL IS NON CREDIT. NO BUT THAT COULD THEN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCREDITATION ROOM RIGHT. SO IT'S COMPLICATED. ASSEMBLY BUT NON CREDIT UNDER CURRENT LAW AND REGULATIONS DOESN'T RESULT IN ASSOCIATE DEGREE WHICH ATTRACTS THE DIRECTION YOU GAVE THE COLLEGE IF IT IS AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE YOU WOULD HAVE TO. AND HAVE TO BE A CREDIT DEGREE YES RIGHT YES BUT THAT ISN'T THE- SO WITH THAT WITH A SPECIFIC CONCENTRATION IS ABOUT THAT'S RIGHT SO. WITH NATIONAL ACCREDITATION AND THE LIMITS ON TRANSFER OF CREDIT BAD CREDIT ASSOCIATE DEGREE WOULD ALSO BE A STRANDED DEGREE. SO THE ACCREDITATION IS MY PRESENTS MORE COMPLICATED- LIMITATIONS ON CALIBRATE THAT. SOME OF WHICH TO LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE WHAT'S IN- THE BUDGET ACT. JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS THERE'S NO ASSOCIATE DEGREES WITH NATIONAL ACCREDITATION THANK YOU DOCTRINES OR CREDIT WENT TO. JUST JUST QUICKLY I THINK THIS IS VERY HELPFUL IN MUDDYING THE WATERS- SO THIS IS A CONVERSATION MAYBE FOR ANOTHER DAY- WITH VERY CLEAR WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THE PANEL EXCEPT KIMBERLY I AM IN YOUR BOAT KIMBERLY- THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND MOVE FORWARD AND DO SOMETHING TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE I WILL ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH. THE CHAIRS COMMENTS ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT BUT I THINK THAT THIS THIS CONVERSATION NOW MISTER CHAIR IS JUST MUDDYING THE WATERS ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY. SIR. YOU GET THE MONEY THEM FURTHER HELLO ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS THE ACADEMIC SENATE EXISTS IN STATUTE- AND REGULATION TO HELP IMPLEMENT WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES CURRENT LEGISLATION IS- A SEPARATE DISTRICT IN COLLEGE AND WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO SERVE THAT FUNCTION- AS BEST WE CAN- I DO THINK WE HAVE LEARNED SOME THINGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND I APPRECIATE THE LEGEND SURE I'M CENTERING HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AT THIS MILESTONE MARKER. I THINK THAT WE'VE LEARNED. WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME WITH JOB PLACEMENT SERVICES LOCALLY WE AREN'T FUNDED I FOR TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK. WE KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME NEED FOR STATEWIDE COORDINATION. EFFORTS OF- HAVE SOME AREAS AND SOME THAT PROBABLY DON'T. ENTER AND THAT THEIR SERVICE DIFFERENTLY I THINK WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT INTERNALLY IN THE SYSTEM ABOUT HOW WE ENCOURAGE- NON CREDIT AND COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION IN OUR SYSTEM AND THAT WE KNOW EXPLICITLY THE BARRIERS THAT MAKE THAT LESS DESIRABLE- FOR COLLEGES TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES. AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS UNDER FUNDED TO DO SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS- THAT THEY COULD BE DOING THAT NEED TO THAT NEEDS SYSTEM MIGHT INSTRUCTION. AND I THINK WE LEARNED THAT WHEN THE SYSTEM IS PROVIDED WITH MONEY AND CLEAR DIRECTION TO EXPAND IN C. T. E. IN THIS AREA. THAT THE CITY ONLINE PATHWAYS GRANT FOR THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. RESULTS AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN NEW AND IMPROVED PATHWAYS AND NINETY NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS SERVED IN TWO YEARS AND SO THIS IS INFORMATION HELPS US MOVE FORWARD- AT THIS POINT AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO ALL OF THOSE ARE VERY VALID POINTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO I KNOW I SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES. IN WORKING WITH THE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCES OFFICE IN THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND ALL OF THOSE INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS IN TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT. THINK IF ANYONE LEAVES. OF THIS HEARING ROOM OF WAS NOTHING ELSE SHE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITH THAT TO. QUESTIONS ARE QUESTIONS TRYING TO GET INFORMATION AND NOT AN INDICATION OF ANYTHING ELSE SO WHAT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. YES SHE THE MOVEMENT. IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN PLEASE PROCEED YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT AND A BRIEF OF.

AND IT'S EXPENSIVE NATURE. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WEREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO SERVE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE UP MEDICAL CODING. OUR HEALTH ED PROFESSORS WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO LOTS MORE TRAINING OF MEDICAL CODERS IF THEY HAD THE- FINANCING FOR IT IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER. OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EXISTING ONLINE PROGRAMS WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE THE MANAGEMENT.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CAL RIGHT IS MEANT TO DO AND IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS W BELIEVE TAT CALPERS MEANS FOCUS ON CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE COLLEGE AND CAREER SKILLS. THAT CAN REPEL STUDENTS INTO ATTAINING HIGHER EDUCATION DEGREES. AND INTO THE WORK FORCE IN A FIELD WITH GROWTH. AND IF YOU NEED TO PASS THREE CALIBRATE OFFERS EMPLOYERS A DIRECT LINE OF INTO. RIPARIAN ARC RETURNING WORK FORCE. AND OURS WAS A POOR CONNECTION WE'VE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN OUR FREE MY FUTURE SPEND AT WORK UP AT. MONTHS STUDENT AT PRO. AT WEAVER SEEN IN BARBERS.

OFFERING SOLELY ENROLLMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WITH PROGRAMS LOOK DIRECTLY LINKED TO EMPLOYER NEEDS. AND A CURRICULUM THAT IS I GO AT YOUR OWN PACE AND SO WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S. CHECKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIBRATE HAS BEEN MAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MEET THEIR LEGISLATIVE OBLIGATIONS. AND GIVEN MORE TIME TO ESTABLISH A BRAND NEW COLLEGE OF AND GET A FULLER PICTURE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE SITUATION.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY MASURIA FROM YOUNG PRINCIPLES REPRESENT YOUNG ADULTS CALIFORNIA AGES EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FOUR. OF ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE SPOKE WITH STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND INITIAL PLANNING STAGES OF CALIBRATE OUR ADULTS THOSE WHO CAN I ENTER. THROUGH THE COMMITTEE CALL SYSTEM FOR MULTI REASONS IN CALIFORNIA'S COST CRISIS. DO DO FROM COMMITMENTS AND OVERWHELM ME THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT. THE CALIBRATION- MANY OF THEM HAD CONSIDERED A FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. AS A MEANS TO RECEIVE SPECIALIZED TRAININGS BELIEVING THAT DEBT. THE TOOK ON. WOULD BE AN OFFSET BY THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED EARNING POTENTIAL. SO THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORTED IN THE PAST. WE KNOW THAT FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES PREY ON THE STUDENTS IN THE GRAPHICS. I'M ESPECIALLY NONTERMINAL STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF LOW INCOME FOR THAT REASON YOU INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THIS MODEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS HEARING MY NAME IS GAIL YEAH AND I'M WITH CALIFORNIA COMPETES HIGHER EDUCATION FOR SHOWING CONNIE- OUR WORK FOCUSES ON AND THE TALK MILLION ADULTS WHO HAVE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE TO SIXTY FOUR THAT HAVE NO COLLEGE DEGREE- BUT ALSO THE FOUR MILLION THAT HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT DIDN'T COMPLETE AND SO WE SEE CALVARY AS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. TO HELP REIMAGINE ONLINE LEARNING AND TO HELP GET THE STUDENTS TO ENTER HIGHER AT- BUT WE DO RECOMMENDS THAT CALIBRATE PARTNER WITH EXISTING ON SUCCESSFUL. PROGRAMS AT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR AT A SIXTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE THOSE SHASTA XCELERATED COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAM.

MY NAME IS MICHAEL SHEETS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE VENTURA COUNTY FEDERATION OF COLLEGE TEACHERS AFT LOCALLY CAN TWENTY EIGHT. I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN URGING YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE FUTURE PUBLIC EDUCATION CALIFORNIA.

TO BE CLEAR WE RECOGNIZE HOW YOU OF TAKING EDUCATION TO THE STUDENTS WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED IN FACT I HAVE LONG BEEN A SUPPORTER OF ONLINE EDUCATION AND CURRENTLY TEACH BOTH ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES HOWEVER. IN THE STATE IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY STRUGGLE YEAR AFTER YEAR STRETCH ARE LIMITED EDUCATIONAL DOLLARS AMONG OUR EXISTING PUBLIC SCHOOLS.% SPENDING THE OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY NECESSARY TO SUPPORT A REDUNDANT AND EFFICIENT PROGRAM IS ALLEGE. MOUSE AND OF THE VERY MY- IN. I DID MISS ME. FOR WE ARE. IS A MY- CAP COMMUNE KERR ARE CANCER WAS THE SOUTH OF RIGHT 3% UP HUNDRED FIVE THE- A YEAR. TO A PMR SO. PATIENT UNDER. IN MY DAY ARE. APPOINTMENTS THE ALREADY OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE OF OUR ON GROUND COURSES IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO EDUCATE FOUR HUNDRED TO STUDENTS WHO YEAR. WHEN EXISTING HUNDRED FOURTEEN LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALREADY IDEALLY SITUATED TO MEET THE EMERGING NEEDS OF OUR STATE. OUR DISTRICT BUDGET HOVERS NEAR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND EVERY YEAR WE STRUGGLE TO MEET THE ON GOING FINANCIAL BURDENS. OF DELIVERING THE QUALITY EDUCATION OUR STUDENTS DESERVE. INSTEAD OF WASTING THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CALIBRATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE REQUIRES TO STAY VIABLE. REINVEST THE MONEY WHERE IT BELONGS IN LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONLINE PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY HELP STUDENTS ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS. ON BEHALF OF THE A FEW LOCAL EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT I URGE YOU TO MAKE THE NECESSARY COURSE CORRECTIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. REMAINS THE HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR NEXT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING HEARINGS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NIKKI GONZALEZ HERE AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT DE ANZA COLLEGE IN CUPERTINO. TOM ALRIGHT BOOSTERS HAVE CRITICIZED OUR EXISTING HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES FOR NOT ADEQUATELY SERVING PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THOSE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES SO CALLED STRANDED WORKERS. BUT CAL PRIDE IS NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN DO BETTER CERTAINLY NOT BETTER ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXTRAORDINARY FUNDING LEVELS. IF THE CAL BRED APPROACH IS SUPERIOR. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO POINT TO IMMEDIATE POSITIVE RESULTS IN THEIR ENROLLMENT DATA AFTER ALL CAL BRIGHT HAS BEEN BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP. WITH THIS SUPPOSEDLY UNIQUE METHODOLOGY TAILORED TO THE VERY SPECIFIC STUDENT POPULATION. THEY SAY NEEDS TO BE SERVED BUT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS CLAIM IN FACT. QUITE THE OPPOSITE FIRST CAL BRIDESMAID AND STUDENT BODY IS TINY. SECOND THEY SERVED ABOUT A THIRD OF THE PERCENTAGE OF LATIN ACT STUDENT SAYS THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE BUT ALMOST STUDENTS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BA DEGREES AND THE REST OF THE SYSTEM BUT ONLY TWO THIRDS IS LIKELY TO HAVE NO TO CREATE ALL. THE COW PRINT BREWSTER'S MADE BIG WAS BASED ON A THEORY THAT THEIR APPROACH IS SPECIAL BUT IF THERE ARE SPECIAL THE EVIDENCE FOR SAYS IT'S NOT THE KIND OF SPECIAL THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO WRAP. AND CERTAIN NOT KINDEST. THIS SHOULD. TO FIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT. I THINK YOU GET AFTER TH. HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER XIN I'M PRESS OF THE PROUD TO FEDERAL OF TO IF TO LOCAL SIXTY NO THREE I REPRESENT THE SOME ONE THOUSAND- FACULTY WHO WORK IN THE PEARL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT- CALIBRATE IS SITUATED LITERALLY IN THE BACKYARD OF THE PEARL TO. COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IT IS COMPETING FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AS WAS NOTED TODAY BUT IT'S ALSO DIRECTLY COMPETING FOR OUR STUDENTS. COLLEGE WHICH OFFERS BOTH IT AND CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE BEING OFFERED TO CALIBRATE. HAS A STUDENT POPULATION THAT'S 27% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 27% LATIN ACTS. THIS IS THE TARGET POPULATION THAT WE WERE TOLD TODAY IS THE TARGET POPULATION FOR CALIBRATE. WE ARE ALREADY SERVING THAT POPULATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO SUFFICIENTLY HELP THOSE STUDENTS AND ASSIST THOSE STUDENTS AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE A MARKETING BUDGET THAT ALLOWS US TO RECRUIT STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE STATE. THE ONLINE OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TODAY ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AT OUR COLLEGES AS YOU'VE HEARD- WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO STEWART SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO FULLY SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS OR% THE SYSTEMS. THAT ARE HELPING THEM. WHAT WE NEED IS NOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH COLLEGE WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE EXISTING COLLEGES INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR PEARL TO DISTRICT. AND I WON ONE ADD ONE OTHER NOTE- THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS ORIGINALLY WERE TOUTED AS THESE CENTERS OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING- THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO AUGMENT TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL. SCHOOLS AND INSTEAD WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THEY'VE SIPHON DOLLARS AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND THEY'VE DONE SO IN MANY WAYS BY CIRCUMVENTING SOME OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I URGE ALL OF US TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY NAME IS ANGER STARK AND I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT LANEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN OAKLAND AND A DISTANCE EDUCATION COORDINATOR FOR THE PEARL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE. AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOU NOT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE LAUNCH OF THE CALIBRATE SYSTEM NEW COLLEGE. BUT INSTEAD TO RE ROUTE THOSE FUNDS TO EXISTING PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES AND I WAS GONNA SAY A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT ONE I DO FEEL LIKE IT IS TO PUT IT IS. AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE IT'S AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO LAUNCH- SUCH A SMALL AND I'M SORT OF RISKY INITIATIVE. BUT INSTEAD OF REHASHING NOT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION. AND THAT IS THAT YOU CONSIDER RE USING THOSE FUNDS FOR TO A DISTINCT GRAMS BUT OUR X. ORDINARY AND ALREADY DOING THE THINGS. IS TRYING. DISTRICT FOR COLLEGES WILL BE SUBMITTING OUR LOCATIONS THAT CONSORTIUM NEXT WEEK AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ARE INNOVATIVE AND BUILDING A STATEWIDE ONLINE COLLEGE. WERE STUDENTS FROM ANYWHERE IN THE STATE CAN ENROLL IN TAKE COURSES AND COMPLETE COURSEWORK AT COLLEGES ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. YES IT MIGHT BE A TINY BIT BEHIND ON ONE SMALL PORTION THE EXCHANGE BUT THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GROWTH AND THE TRAINING THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. THE SECOND IS ONE THAT YOU CHAIR ROF MENTIONED AND IT'S CALLED THE ONLINE CITY PATHWAYS INITIATIVE. AND IT'S A GRANT THAT WAS GIVEN OUT OF THIS YEAR TO A NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN THIS DISTRICT I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT% EIGHTY I MEAN THE STATE ABOUT THE COLLEGES. TO SPECIFICALLY GROW ON CREATE INNOVATION AND GROW THE CTP PROGRAMS THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO PUT IT ON MY INVITE. AND IS FUNDING ALL THESE COLLEGES ACROSS THE STREET ALREADY TO INNOVATE AND TRY TO PUT THOSE ON LINE. TO CONTINUE THAT GRANT BEYOND JUST ONE YEAR YOU WOULD GET SO MUCH MORE VALUE FOR THE MONEY THE PUTTING SO MUCH INTO THE CAL BRIGHT. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS NEXT YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RALPH CHAIR LEYVA I'M DEBBIE KLEIN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND I'M PROUD TO BE A FACULTY MEMBER FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW IN OUR SYSTEM I TEACH ANTHROPOLOGY. A GAVEL IN COLLEGE AND I'M HERE TO ECHO WHAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID. SO WHEN THE CONCEPT FOR CALIBRATE WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED FAQ OFFERED A MORE COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD BETTER SERVE STUDENTS STATEWIDE AND REGIONALLY WE STILL BELIEVE AND INCREASING INVESTMENT IN THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE pA LOT HERE. THIS REMAINS THE BEST PATH FORWARD INSTEAD OF CONTINUED FUNDING FOR CALIBRATE. THIS SPRING OVER ONE HUNDRED CTE COURSES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO THE ONLINE MODALITY WHICH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THAT'S AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO WILL COMPLETE THESE COURSES THIS YEAR INCREASED INVESTMENT IN OUR EXISTING ONLINE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS ALREADY PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. WE UNDERSTAND THE GOAL OF OUT COMPETING FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. OUR EXISTING MODEL DOES IT BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN THE FOR PROFITS. WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THAT. PLEASE ALRP CAO BRIGHT SO. TO X. KERN. MY FOR A- FACT FOR IS CELL AS A- TO THE LEAD. TO FROM RIGHT BUT STILL. WILL BE SIR PAUL CAO. BECAUSE STUDENT. THANK YOU THANKS THANKS TIME. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON SHERMAN LEYVA GOOD AFTERNOON GERMAN RAW MY NAME'S MILE MISS AT THE CALL. AND WE SAY TO PROOF. TO ATTEND THE CALL. IT'S A COME THAT HAS T. LIKE ABOUT THE STUDENTS. HAS A DIVERSE POPULATION WITH PEOPLE OF ALL CAREERS AND AGES RIGHT HAS A MYRIAD OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND THESE ARE ALL THINGS WHICH ARE ABSENCE FROM CAL BREAKS RIGHT IT'S AN ONLINE COLLEGE WHO SENSUALLY WEBSITE. RIGHT WITH NO FULL TIME FACULTY NO ESTABLISH STRUCTURES OF OVERSIGHT AND DUPLICATE CLASSES WHICH ARE LEGAL. RIGHT NOW UNDERSTAND THE EXCUSE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR FUNDING CAL BRIGHT WAS THAT IT IT WOULD SERVICE SPECIFIC POPULATION OF STUDENTS WHOSE NEEDS WERE NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THE REASON THE STUDENTS NEEDS ARE NOT MET BUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO DO THAT. AS JIM MILLER MENTIONED COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVE THE LOWEST PER PER PUPIL FUNDING OF ANY KIND OF INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION- PROGRAMS WHICH ALREADY EXISTS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WITH EXTRA FUNDING. THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE EXPANDED. AND CHANCELLOR OAKLEY MENTIONED FACULTY TRAINS SPECIFICALLY TO CATER TO WORKING STUDENTS NEEDS. AND I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THAT MEANS EXACTLY. BUT I'VE BEEN DEMANDS A LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE FACULTY THERE IS PERFECTLY WELL TRAINED ENOUGH. TO CATER TO WORKING STUDENTS RIGHT IF ANYTHING IT WOULD BENEFIT THE MORE TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO EXPAND THE FACULTY IN BETTER COMPENSATE THEM. SO ALL IN ALL IF YOU WERE TO INVEST THESE FUNDS INTO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOT ONLY WOULD YOU ALLOW FOR A LARGER DIVERSE CITY OF PROGRAMS TO BE OFFERED. WHICH WOULD ALSO BE PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH MORE THAN JUST A BROWSER TAB ON THEIR COMPUTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS YES SIR. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I'M ROB SCHNEIDERMAN ON THE PRESIDENT THE COAST FEDERATION EDUCATORS WE REPRESENT ABOUT A THOUSAND FULL AND PART TIME FACULTY DOWN ORANGE COUNTY. AND AS YOU KNOWS STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN DECLINING AND I'M IN MEETINGS DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITH THE THREE COLLEGES ORANGE COAST COLLEGE GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE IN COASTLINE COLLEGE WE'RE JUST WORKING HARD TO FIND WAYS TO INCREASE OUR FULL TIME IN ROMAN R. F. T. S. AND- I JUST KNOW IF THIS WAS FUNDED. THE THAT COMPETENCY BASED BASED EDUCATION IF IT WAS FUNDED I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL STEP UP TO THE CHALLENGE AND BRING THOSE STUDENTS AND PROVIDE THAT COMPENSATE BASE EDUCATION SO I HOPE YOU CONSIDER FUNDING THE ALLOCATE THAT MONEY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU TIME NEXT YES MA'AM I HEAR IT YEAH I'M ROBERT AT PHD IN GEOPHYSICS AND I'M GEOLOGY AN EARTH SCIENCE FACULTY AT ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE IN LANCASTER CALIFORNIA- I DON'T WANNA BE DUPLICATIVE. OF ANYTHING EITHER SINCE LOOKS LIKE I'M LAST ON THE LIST HERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DUPLICATION ALL DAYS YEAH EXACTLY SO JUST ASSUMING THAT THE MONEY IS FINITE IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE IT SEEMS OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR COME RIGHT- THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR APPARENTLY WHEN THE BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING. AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THINGS LIKE BASIC SUPPLIES OR PROP- JUST FOR RUNNING AB CLASSES. YEAH IT'S AS IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME SEARCHING ABOUT THIS IS THE BEST USE. OF THAT KIND OF MONEY BECAUSE- FROM WHAT I KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY UNDER DISCUSSION HERE IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO. THE YEARLY BUDGET OF AT LEAST MANY OF THE MID SIZE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND SO IT'S CONCERNING THAT THERE'S THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE WHEN ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOLS STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET RESOURCES- CLASSROOM PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET RESOURCES. AND ONE LAST COMMENT ABOUT THIS IDEA OF ONLINE ACCESS. I A REGULARLY COME ACROSS MANY MANY MANY STUDENTS THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A LAPTOP. SO I'M A BIT CONFUSED AS TO HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ONLINE PROGRAMS. WHEN THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE LAPTOPS OR TABLETS AND THIS DOES SEEM CONCERNING TWO OTHER. FOLKS THAT ARNOLD VALLEY COLLEGE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO HAVE A LAPTOP TO LEARN PROGRAM WHERE WHEN OUR COMPUTERS. GET CYCLED OUT OF IT FACULTY WORK SPACES ARE COMPUTER LABS THE LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS BASICALLY GET DONATED TO NEEDY STUDENTS. AS I THINK THERE'S A YOU MENTIONED CART BEFORE THE HORSE EARLIER AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS VERY VERY CONCERNING ABOUT CALLED RIGHT SOMEONE REGISTER MY OPPOSITION TO IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AT THIS OF. WHAT FOR OUR HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE NOW ADJOURNED.
