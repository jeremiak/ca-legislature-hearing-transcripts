THIS IS NOT AN ACTION ITEM HEARING TODAY IT'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT WE HEAR OUR DISTRICT THAT'S HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS CALL IT SAYS. WHETHER IT'S THE- CSU SYSTEM THE UC SYSTEM OF THE COMMUNICABLE SYSTEM IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL THAT HOME HERE QUITE OFTEN WE ALSO NOTES AND FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY. WELL LOOK AT THE MOMENT TRANSFER PAST DECADE I TALK WITH ALL THE SEGMENTS ABOUT HOW CAN BUILD CAPACITY THAT ARE CALLED THE UNIVERSITIES NEXT DECADE. WE DO NOT WE TALK ABOUT THE HEARING FEW WEEKS AGO THAT WE NEED TO ANY. NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OF BACHELOR'S DEGREES CALIFORNIA. AT ACCORDING TO PP I SEE WE NEED TO ENROLL ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS EACH YEAR AT OUR YES YOU SYSTEM. AND ABOUT THOUSAND MORE THE UC JUST THE END OF THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THIRTY WORKFORCE A PROJECTIONS HELLO ACTOR THEM GOOD. COMBAT IS THAT MY CALIFORNIANS I YOU.

WITH ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS- AT YES DO. AND FOR MORE. DENSE AT TO SEE. DECADE YOURSELF. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE YOU SEE WE'VE HAD AN ISSUE WITH FEWER CALIFORNIANS FRANKLY GAINING ACCESS WE'VE SEEN NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY INCREASE WE HAVE A TABLE AND PARENTS AND STRIKING NUMBERS THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA TUDENTS IN UP CLOSE OUT THING THAT WE KNOW WE NEED. THE BAD NEWS FOR THE CS WITH EVERY YEAR. QUALIFIED APPLICANTS APPLY AND ARE TURNED AWAY SO DEMAND IS FAR OUT PACING SUPPLY- WE TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS IN MANY WAYS WE HAD I THINK A FAIR POLICY- CREATING A FORMULA NICK FOR NOT. ROMAN YOU SEE OUR IMPLEMENTING NEW POLICIES IT CSU DIRECT STUDENTS TO SECONDARY CAMPUS OF THEY'LL GET THE CAMPUS THEIR FIRST CHOICE AND WE'RE DOING THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE LIKE HE INCREASING FINANCIAL LET. MAKING COMMUNICORP FOR INSTANCE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS SO WE'RE DOING OUR PART WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF OUR CAMPUS YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T WE'VE ONLY BUILT ON WHO KNEW. YOU SEE IN CSU CAMPUS IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WE BOUGHT YOU KNOW DOES IT COUPLE DOESN'T STATE PRISONS. ARE READY FOR USE HE IS HE SAYS I'LL KNOW THAT'S THE MOST APPROVING A DO WE DO NOW WE CAN BETTER GET A LOT. CAN'T ENTER OFF CAMPUS CENTER. THERE FOR. INCREASE ACCESS FOR A CALL. OF WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE CRATER WAYS TO ACTS THROUGH OUR- HIGHER ED SEC SEGMENTS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE ALSO KNOW THAT PART OF THE PUZZLE TO. IS ARE ON PRIVATE BECAUSE YOU NEVER HEAR FROM THEM. A LATER AS WELL. AS WITH THAT. WE'RE GOOD AT. THE CALL. LETTERS FOUNDATION. STARTED OFF THE MORNING AND A GIVE A PRESENTATION ON ADDRESSING CAPACITY SHORTFALLS AT OUR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN RDSP MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RE YES AND KEPT A BOT AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE COLLEGE FEATURES FOUNDATION THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT BUILDING HIGHER EDUCATION CAPACITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE SENSE TO AGREED. TO WHICH THE DREAMS AND STRENGTH ECONOMY AND SOCIETY ISSUE OF QUEBEC THE IS VITAL AND COMPLEX AND STEPS CAN TAKE YOUR TURN TO ADDRESS IT COLLEGE. NO A COMPLETE WRONG TIED TO AT. BILL I WITH EVERY DAY CAPACITY SHORT ALSO AFFECTS TO INCOME AND THAT'S WHY WORK WITH ORGAN AND ACROSS THE STATE TO CATALYZE SYSTEMIC CHANGE CHRIS DEGREE COMPLETION AND CLOSE EQUITY GAP A COLLEGE FEATURES FOUND RECENTLY COMMISSION THE END WE NEED TO THE POST SECONDARY CAPACITY IT IS IN THE STATE. THIS PAST FALL WE ENTIRE. ROOM FOR SIX ENDS AT OF CAPACITY AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT UC CSU THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND IT ALSO LOOKS AT CONNECTIONS TO THE WORK FORCE AND ECONOMY AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY. AS SO LET'S START WITH. THE AS YOU MENTIONED YOUR MCCARTY K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS THANKS TO EFFORTS IN UNDERTAKEN BY THE STATE AND THE EDUCATION SEGMENTS IN THE LAST DECADE. MORE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING FROM. THAN EVER BEFORE FOR MORE OF THEM COMPLETE A THREE BECAUSE PREP COURSE WERE. AND FOR IS TWELVE. XIN IS IN DECLINE NUMBER COLLEGE READY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IS EXPECTED TO CLIMB BY ABOUT 10% ANNUALLY THREE TWENTY THIRTY. AND IN ADDITION GROWING NUMBERS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS COMPLETE AND FOR PATHWAYS CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION- AT A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION EXPANDED STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES AND IMPROVE NATION WITH ADVERSITIES HOPE. ARE FOCUSED ON HELPING THEM AND FOR MORE EASILY. AND WE CAN'T THAT'S THAT'S CAN YOU BUT REPAIR HIGHER ED AND TO SINCE STATE NOT. A PATH. WHAT IT'LL SHOW YOU IS THAT IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR ELIGIBILITY SIR PASSED CAPACITY BY ABOUT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS AT CALIFORNIA FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION. AND IF WE DON'T ACT THAT NUMBER WILL NEARLY DOUBLE ANY THIRTY CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE A- AND FOUR FOUR THOUSAND POLICY STUDENTS IN. THE BY THAT THERE. COURSE PLUS ABOUT. DOESN'T MEAN IT COLLEGES BUT THAT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL. AND THE COMBAT COLLEGES WHITE IN THE STATE'S ALREADY DEEP RACIAL INCOME IN GEOGRAPHIC INEQUITIES STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF COURSE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT THEY'RE THE ONES. WHOM THE COMBAT CRISIS HURTS MOST THE STUDENT BASIC FIGURES AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE DIVISIONAL BURKE. INTO PERTINI OUT REGENERATE OUT OF THIS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE INSIDE FOR. ACID IS OUR PARTICULAR YOU IN REGIONS WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FOR EXAMPLE IN BY TWENTY THIRTY THE INLAND EMPIRE WILL FACE AN ANNUAL COST CITY GAP. TWENTY THAT AND SEATS FOR THESE WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF OF THE ESTIMATED QUALIFIED STE SINCE IN THE RE. AT MILLER. VALLEY WILL IN OKAY GAP OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND SEATS. IS SANTA IT SEE IF REGIONAL AND OKAY THAT'S THE OF SIXTEEN SEATS- AND OF COURSE THESE ARE AND BY NO MEANS THE ONLY REGION'S WITH THIS TROUBLING TREND CAPACITY IS TRULY A STATE WIDE TO AN ERROR COMMUNITY CAN AND DO MORE TO ADDRESS IT AT COMPOUNDING THIS CAPACITY TAP HIS ARE CHANGING BONHOMIE AS PAT APPS TWENTIETH. YOU SING TO FOR WORK POLITICS AND- NUMBER THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THIS TODAY THE SHORTFALL OF NEARLY ONE POINT ONE MILLION WORKERS WITH THE BATCHES IN I KNOW YOU. YES PROGRESSES BE CLOSING THAT GAP BUT DEMAND REMAINS HIGH AND A LOT MORE MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO RECOMMEND THREE CONCRETE STEPS TO ADDRESS CAPACITY AND DEMAND FOR DEGREES THAT INVOLVE INNOVATION ACROSS SECTORS AND SEGMENTS FIRST TO ACCOMMODATE DEMAND WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE SERVICE. CAN TO EXPAND THE EGGS. YEAH OUR TING STUDENT SUCCESS BORN. STUDENTS EARN THEIR DEGREES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND AS A RESULT CREATE ROOM FOR MORE STUDENTS WE APPLAUD THE STATE TO LEADERSHIP ON MANY OF THESE REFORMS WILL ENROLLMENT CLEAR. WAYS LIMóN EDUCATION FORM AND NOW IS THE TIME TO LEAN FURTHER INTO THESE EFFORTS TO ENSURE MORE STUDENTS ARE BENEFITING UP FUTURE EFFORT SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN STUDENT NEEDS AND ADDRESS A NATIONAL CREDIT THE BEAR SUCH AS THE FULL COST OF. COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. THIS WILL IMPROVE. AND ACCELERATE THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE CAPACITY. AT SECOND TO EXPAND OUR SUPPLY WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE USE SPACE AND RESOURCES WE SHOULD LEVERAGE PHYSICAL SPACE MORE CREATIVELY SHARING ALL THESE AND OTHER RESOURCES. EDUCATION INTO EDUCATION CONSISTENT- I'M- HERE LITTLE. THAT ESCAPES SHOULD MAXIMIZE WILL RESET IS OFFER MARK IS IN THIS IS EVENING AND WEEKENDS. ADJUSTED BUSINESSES THE FLEXIBLE AND LOCATION HIGHER. NEEDS AT YOU THINK BEYOND THE SMALL ONES AND TO PASS. FURTHER HELLO CAPACITY OR FALLS. BE A- THIS IN RURAL. COLLABORATIVELY TO A EYES. THIRD AND FINALLY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON REGIONS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS SHOULD BE KEY PLAYERS IN THAT WORK CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SEVERAL REGION OPERATIVES THAT WERE PROCESSED AND EDUCATION SEGMENT DRESSED. AND WE SHOULD REALLY BRIDGE DOES EFFORTS DRESS CAN I SET HAND THE GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS CAN OFTEN MOVE MORE QUICKLY THAN THE STATE TO IDENTIFY NEED SECURE LOCAL SUPPORT. AND INCREASED THAT MEET LOCAL DEMAND AND ALSO DEVELOP PROP. SEC I'M UP OF HIS BETTER. SO FOR HIGHER READ OUR ECONOMY NEEDS MORE WORKERS WITH DEGREES AND WE MUST IMPROVE HIGHER EDUCATION CITY TO MEET THOSE DEMANDS THE STATUS QUO IS AND TEN OF. AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE THE- TWO CAN NEITHER HIGHER ED. I AMONG THE STATE'S BEST ASSETS WE WORK TO GET TO IN THE STUDENTS TO FULFILL POTENTIAL ARE YOU CAN READ THE BACK FITS. ANY SO THANK YOU FOR THE ANY TO PRESENT. OUR CAN COME. INTO IF YOU HAVE THAT OKAY. I QUESTION FROM. SPEAKER MR MEDINA. WOULD YOU ABLE TO JUST QUICKLY LET ME KNOW TELL ME- THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO WHO DOES TO FILL IN CALIFORNIA THE A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS. THE PERSON IT'S MORE THAN HALF FOR SURE I THINK IT'S OF. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE EXACT NUMBER BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE MAJORITY AT THIS POINT OKAY AND WE SEE MUCH OF A DECLINE WHEN YOU LOOK AT. SPECIFIC RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. IT KIND OF THE THERE ISN'T A VERY IS ON THE ON THE DIMENSIONS THAT YOU MAY THINK A DEFINITELY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF GAINES SIMPLY MADE A LASTING YOU SEEM TO IN ALL OF THE GROUPS OF ALL THE RACIAL GROUPS- BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY GAP BY. I THINK DEVICE AS WELL AS EACH. AND WHEN WE YOU LOOK AT ASSN THE IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS OF HOW MANY OF OUR GRADUATES ACTUALLY GO OUTSIDE A CALIFORNIA TO DO WE HAVE ANY. OF THAT KIND OF DATA YEAH IT'S HARD TO PINPOINT EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOW BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF OUR DATA AND THAT KIND OF THE NEXT ACROSS SEGMENTS IN THAT WAY. AND WE KNOW THE THERE ARE AND LEAVING I PERSONALLY. AND TO WHICH THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE NOT CONNECTED IN THAT WAY WITH TWELVE I DO IT. DATE AS AS WHERE THEY GO IN COLLEGE GIVE SURE. MISTER REPP HE WAS CHAIR YOUR SLIDE SHOWS SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS- COULDN'T GET IN THE UC OR- SEE ISSUE IS THAT THEY CAN GET INTO THE CAMPUS OTHER CHORES FOR THE PROGRAMMER YEAH SO OUR BURNED OUT THE DEATH BY LEVELING DIRECTIONAL IS SO WE DIDN'T LOOK AT APPLICATIONS AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THEIR FIRST CHOICE APPLET THIS IS ABOUT. STATE THE COMPLETION OF A THREE G. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. I TRANSFERRED KIND OF ELIGIBILITY OR ADULTS WHO MADE A SMALL SHARE ARE ADULTS WHO MAY WANT TO GO BACK- AND TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE THEY- HAD NOT COMPLETED SO IT'S NOT ABOUT APPLICATION TO YOU KNOW. IT IS A LEAD OR PARTICULAR CAMPUS IT'S MORE ABOUT THE BROADER SENSIBILITY BEFORE FOR A YEAR AND IT ALSO AND PRIVATE SAYS WELL OKAY FOLLOW UP ON MY CALLER REMEMBER SIDE SO WE DON'T KNOW. OF THE SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND GOT IN SCHOOL BUT WENT ONCE A MONTH WE DON'T TRACK THE RIGHT SO WILL BE ICING TO STATE TRACK THAT. NOT NOT IN HEALTHY ADULTS BELIEF. AND THEN YOU ALSO SAY THAT SEE ISSUES PUT IN A NEW PROCESS THIS PAST FALL- REDIRECTING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AFGHANS WHO DENIED ADMISSION TO THE CAMPUS OF THEIR CHOICE NINE HUNDRED WERE ACCEPTED AND AGAIN DO WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND NOW I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A LARGE. QUESTION IN A BIG KIND OF. TENSION IS NOT HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND NOT KNOWING WHERE MANY STUDENTS GO I MEAN I THINK IN A TOTALLY WE KNOW MANY GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND RIGHTLY SO AND MANY MANY OF POSTPONED THEIR- COLLEGE TO PLANS. UNTIL THEY FIND OUT WHERE THEY GO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF. A LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THESE IN WHICH KIND OF GOING OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR THEM SO OFTEN WE KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS. DO NOT CONTINUE- AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND THEIR LOCAL STATION- OKAY. MARK THANK YOU STRUCTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. LET'S GET GOING WITH OUR NEXT PANEL. WE'RE HAVING FIRST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THREE SPEAKERS AND WE- WE DO HAVE QUITE A LONG LIST OF PARTICIPANTS TODAY AND WE KNOW WE HAVE PUBLIC CALM AS WELL WE'RE GIVING EACH.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE PERSON CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED CALIFORNIA UNDER JOINT ENROLLMENT BY NEED. TWENTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS. THIS GROWTH IN RECENT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY STATE SUPPORT BOTH FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS. FULLY FUNDING NEW ROMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY ALLOWS FOR THE HIRING OF FACULTY AND THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT STUDENTS NEED. AND PRE FUNDING ENROLLMENT ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY TO MAKE IT MISSION DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA GRADUATE. WITH. TWENTY IT'S LIKE TO- SOME OF OUR ACCESS TRENDS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. TURNING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER THE UNIVERSITY ENROLLS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW UNDERGRADUATES EACH YEAR OF WHICH NINETEEN THOUSAND HAVE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNIVERSITY FROM ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

HOWEVER WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE INCREASE IN TRANSFER APPLICANTS WITH TAGS THIS YEAR WHICH WE REVIEWED PART NEW ADMIT VIRGINITY. WE ALSO WANT TO GROW DISCUSS WITH YOU ARE. OPERATION AND THE CASE PARTNERSHIPS SAY PAP PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ALSO A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR ACCESS STRATEGY SIX IS A PORTFOLIO PROGRAMS EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND TOOLS THERE ARE THIRTEEN IN TOTAL THAT SPANNED THE EDUCATION PIPELINE FROM PRE SCHOOL TO GRADUATE EDUCATION. THEY SERVE THE STATE'S FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND THE SCHOOLS THEY IT INTO. THEY PUT PROGRAMS REACH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND K. TWENTY STUDENTS AT MORE THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA PUBLIC KATO SCHOOLS HUNDRED FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AS OTHER INSTITUTIONS. SAVE UP ALSO INCLUDES GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE OUR HIGH ACHIEVING FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATES FOR CAREERS AS ACADEMICS RESEARCHERS PRACTITIONERS AND LEADERS. AND THREE SAY PEP UC ENGAGES IN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH SECONDARY SCHOOLS OTHER EDUCATION SECTORS COMMUNITY A STORE STATIONS. AS AN INDUSTRY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES AN OPPORTUNITY AND IMPROVE ACCESS. WE ALSO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURED THE DEATHS OF THE PROGRAMS AND WHETHER THEY ARE IMPROVING STUDENTS CHANCES OF GETTING INTO COLLEGE AND SUCCEEDING. ARE ACCOUNTABILITY WORK IS GUIDED BY AN ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE UNIVERSITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND FLIGHTS FIVE AND SIX- SHOW SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF OUR SAY PET PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE PARTICIPANTS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT COLLEGE READINESS AND COLLEGE ENROLLMENT ARE YOU'LL TO APPLICATION RATES THE UNIVERSITY FOR SAY PAP ARE HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. SIMILAR SCENES FROM SAID. AND BUILD A PLATE THE STUDENTS IN ROLE IN ALL OF OUR PEPPER.

STATE TAPE UP HAS REMAINED CONSTANT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE AT TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION- AS A CONSEQUENCE THE SCOPE OF STATE PET PROGRAM. BROKE BROKE RAMMING HAS NOT GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. THE UNIVERSE YES CHALLENGED IN SERVING A NA UNDER RESOURCE SCHOOLS AN IMP ING WITH THE GROWING NMBER TWELVE COULD CHARTER SCHOOLS. EDUCATE LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. SAVE UP. REPRESENTS ONE OF THE GUARANTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY ONE OF ITS ITS ITS PRINCIPLES- WE'VE HOW LONG DELIVERED HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS WE HAVE STRONG OUTCOMES THESE PROGRAMS OPEN DOORS AND CHANGE LIVES AND THEY REPRESENT ONE OF THE CRITICAL WAYS THAT YOU SEE SO. THOSE WHO LIVE HERE. AND LEAD HE- AND WE WILL WAS BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR PAST SUPPORT TO HELP US TO STAY IN OUR FUNDING FOR THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS I'LL NOW TURN TO VICE PRESIDENT BROWN WHO WILL DISCUSS OUR STRATEGIES FOR INCREASING ENROLLMENT. THANKS VERY MUCH. I REFER TO THE INFORMATION SLIDE SEVEN UP WHICH TALKS ABOUT ARE YOU SEE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE MAJORITY OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE PELL FIRST GENERATION AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. AND THE UC TWENTY THIRD FRAMEWORK A PORTION OF THAT IS FOCUSING ON INSURANCE THE STUDENTS SUCCEED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. OUR FIRST GOAL IS- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE DEGREES BY TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S A HUNDRED DEVELOP UNDER. PLEASE FOR THE GRAD. IS AND ON TOP ONE MILLION TREES ALREADY HAD. ACTED UP SOME OF THAT THROUGH IN ROMAN. CLEARLY IT BAD WITH. ON A PUZZLE ON A BECAUSE TAKE A LOOK STATE WERE. NEEDS CONSIDERING GRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS IMPORTANT- THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED FEELS THAT WILL REQUIRE GRADUATE DEGREES PARTICULARLY IN HEALTH CARE AND TECHNOLOGY. AND MARK. FROM THE CALIFORNIA FUTURES FOUNDATION THEIR REPORT HAS ALSO IDENTIFIED IN XIN GRADUATE SEATS AND SO THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. OUR SECOND GOAL IS FOCUSED ON ENSURING NINE OF TEN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL WANTED TO GET A DEGREE. OF THE BIGGEST. OKAY THIS ONE IS DURING TIME TUITION FOR PELL FOR GENERATION. AND UNDER READ IT'S DO THAT'S OUR NEW CHEN STUDENTS WITH TO ENSURE THAT THEY GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER WE ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS GRADUATE DEGREE ATTAINMENT APPS FOR THOSE ON SUSAN'S. AND IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY AND A FOCUS TO DIVERSIFY THE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- THE TWO GRAPHS THAT WE SHOW AT THE TOP HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT THESE STUDENTS NOT GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT'S FOR STATE THAT GREG MADE AND FOUR YEAR THE BLUE A IN. FOR THOSE THAT BRITAIN'S. WHICH IS IN RED THEY AND TO LEAVE WAS FIVE HUNT MORE IN DEBT. UP AND OVER THE FIRST DECADE THEY WILL HAVE LAW EARNINGS THAT AMOUNT TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. THERE'S A PERSONAL ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE STUDENTS TO NOT GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE EMPHASIZING THAT. AS BEING CRITICAL FOR US WITH THE TWENTY TO GO ANOTHER THING IT IS INSCRIBED IN SIX YEARS COMPARED TO THEIR LESS LIKELY TO GO ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. AS WE WERE TO. THE PATH TO GET. A DEGREE ALSO TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY. TORY ING ABLE TO ADVANCE PATH IN THE PLANE IS EMPTY. SO THAT'S A AREA OF FOCUS. NUMBER DO YOU THINK. BY DID. ONE OF THE KEY THING FIRST TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT COURSES TO BE ABLE TO TAKENTO INCREASE THAT AND IN FOR THE THIRD GOAL TO GROW- ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FACULTY OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. NOT ONLY THAT BUS INCREASED NUMBER OF COURSE IS THAT WERE OFFERING IT'LL ALSO HELP ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ABLE TO GET INTO THE MAJOR OF THEIR CHOICE WHERE THAT IS LESS LIKELY TO THAN IT WAS A DECADE AGO. IT SCHOOL OR IN. OF IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHT THAT. HURTING TO SEE A DECLINE IN FIRST YEAR RETENTION RATES PARTICULARLY AGAIN FOR A PELL FIRST GENERATION UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS- AND WITHOUT INVESTMENT WE NOT ONLY LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS A THIS GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THESE IS A IMPROVEMENTS IT'LL ALSO. DECREASE ARE LIKELY HAD TO REACH THE DEGREE ATTAINMENT GOALS. I'M TURNING TO SLIDE EIGHT. THIS IS FOCUSING ON- SOME OF THE CURRICULAR STRATEGIES AND ENROLLMENT GOALS THAT WE HAVE A FIRST- OUR FOCUS IS ON SHARING THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO PASS THE COURSE THAT THEY TAKE FIRST TIME THAT THEY DO. A AND THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS CAPACITY SHOES. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME LARGEST GATEWAY COURSES THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE STEAK AT WORKING WITH THE FACULTY IN THOSE COURSES THREE DOES AND THE CURRICULA TO RE. THINK HOW THEY'RE DELIVERING COURSES AT AND TO PROVIDE WHAT IS TO I'D IT FOR THEMSELVES THIS IS SO. IN IN. IN. TWO NINETY TO MAKE A CHANGE BEFORE THE END OF THE COURSE OF VICE PROVOST GLAD HAD TALKED ABOUT THE GROWTH THAT WE'VE HAD WITH TRANSFERS WE ARE EXPANDING OUR OPPORTUNITIES. TO ON BOARD AND PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT OVER THE SUMMER SO THAT THEY HAVE A SMOOTH INTRODUCTION AND PARTICULARLY GET EARLY INFORMATION ABOUT. OPPORTUNITIES AT OUR CHURCH UNIVERSE INCLUDING RESEARCH. ON IT AS WITH THEIR SHORTER TO MONKEY. OF THE THIRD THING IS TO ADVANCE OR PHOENICIAN FOR STRATEGIES- THE BEACH A TRADITIONAL. ADVICE OF IF YOU WANT TO GET ON TO THE CAMPUS. ARTS SLOW. AND ACCLIMATE TO THE CAMPUS RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TAKING A FULL LOAD IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO AND IT IS THE WAY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE MOVING IN ON A TIMELY MANNER SO. STRATEGIES FOR ADVISING OR CHANGING A AND WE'RE CHANGING SOME OF THE POLICIES TO PUSH. A LARGE. UNITS AT STUDENTS KING AND THEN ACT ADVISING TO MEET THOSE GOALS. I WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE SUMMER SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL AID- THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THE CHART SHOWS GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN AND HAD QUE ROMANS OVER THE PERIOD JUST IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD ALMOST THREE. MORE AS IN ROUTE SUMMER. AND AT THAT CONTINUE FOR THE PORT IN IN ADDITION TO THE SUMMER PAL IS HELPFUL FOR US IN MEETING THOSE GOALS OF GETTING OUR PAL FIRST CHEN AN UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO GRADUATE IN. TIMELY MANNER. GIVING MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN SUMMER BUT ALONG WITH EXPANDING OUR OPPORTUNITIES WITH SUMMER BRIDGE AND TRANSFER IT AS PERSONAL. FRIENDS THAT- GETS SENT BILL THING THAT I WANT TO TALK. IS A YOU SEE IS LAW THE ONE TIME. THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE TO EXPAND DEGREE AND WORKFORCE CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT. OF THREE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION- WE SENT OUT AN R. F. P. WE'VE RECEIVED SEVEN PROPOSALS FROM CAMPUSES THAT BOTH WOULD- PROVIDE WORKFORCE CREDENTIALS THAT ARE ON CRITICAL TO. THE ECONOMY OF AND ALSO BRING STUDENTS BACK WHO ARE CLOSE TO BUT HAVE NOT FINISHED A DEGREE WERE INTHE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THOSE- AND- WILL PASS IT NOW OVER TO A COLLEAGUE TAKE. THANK YOU PANEL UP I'M SAY EVER CANNON OF I WANTED TO START OUT BY THINKING THIS THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR. OF PLACING PROP THIRTEEN ON THE BALLOT UNFORTUNATELY THE GEO BOND DID NOT PASS BUT THE UNIVERSITY HAS IDENTIFIED OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL OUT PROJECTS THAT WOULD HELP US. A INCREASED EDUCATION COMPOSITE ON OUR CAMPUSES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND FIVE FINDING WAYS THAT WE CAN FIND SOME OF THE PROJECTS AND CONTINUE TO. LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE TO INCREASE PASADENA CAMPUS. THANK YOU. OKAY THERE WE GO. DESPERATE QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW BUT REACH OUT TO OTHERS FIRST. OKAY MR MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP IN IN OUR HAND OUT ON PAGE FIVE WE HAVE- THE CHART GRAPH OF THE ADMISSION RATE AT THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES OF UC. AND. AS YOU GUYS KNOW I REPRESENT RIVERSIDE VERY PROUD THAT UC RIVERSIDE HAS AMONG THE HIGHEST- DIVERSITY OF THE UC'S AS I LOOK AT THE CHART ON PAGE FIVE AND LOOK AT THE ADMISSION RATE AT WHICH VARIES. FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS IN OUR I. AS WE KNOW UCLA AND BERKELEY BUT THESE THESE FIGURES ARE ARE TELLING WHICH HAVE THE LOWEST ADMISSION RATE. ALSO ON PAGE FIVE OF MY HAND OUT. THE MY AGENDA. SO YEAH. THANK YOU FRONT PAGE FIVE OF THE AGENDA. WE SEE THE ADMISSION RATES ACT OF THE- OF STUDENTS TO APPLY TO THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES. RIGHT I BERKELEY 17% IF I'M READING IT CORRECTLY OF FRESHMAN APPLICANTS ARE ARE ACCEPTED. RIGHT 26% OF TRANSFERS YOU UCLA RIVERSIDE UC RIVERSIDE GOES UP IS. 57% UC MERCED WHICH IS ALSO VERY DIVERSE 75% OF ADMITS ARE ACCEPTED SO MY QUESTION IS TO THE TO THE- GOAL OF DIVERSITY AT THE OTHER CAMPUSES SPECIFICALLY BURKE AND UCLA WHAT ARE THOSE TWO CAMPUSES DOING TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICANS DO. AT WAS TO CAMP. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BOB. WE WILL BERKELEY HAS EMBARKED ON- TO AYE IMPORTANT INITIATIVES I THINK HERE ONE IS THEIR AFRICAN AMERICAN INITIATIVE WHICH IS- BACK BY SOME SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO CLOSE THE NATURAL GAP THAT STUDENTS UP PERCEIVE THAT THEY WILL EXPERIENCE IN ACCEPTING YOU SEE OFFER OF UCLA ALL OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES EITHER THROUGH FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THROUGH OUR STUDENT INITIATED OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO REACH. COMMUNITIES AND HELP STUDENTS HERE FOR AN UP TO THE IN. OF UTAH UT. WE ARE ALSO SUING FOR THE IS BEEN VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT PURSUING IT STATUS AS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION WHICH HAS EGGS ALLOW THEM TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHERE THERE ARE PERHAPS INEQUITIES AN OPPORTUNITY. THAT UP FOR THAT ARE BEING EXACERBATED BY BY CERTAIN PRACTICES AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING OUR HOLISTIC REVIEW PROCESS OUR COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS PROVIDE THE MOST OPPORTUNITY FOR CAL OF YOUR STUDENTS THAT BE SAID. BUT BURKE IS A HIGH COLLECTIVE YOU. IT'S A LOT OF APPLE AND SO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS ONE OF THOSE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN WE CAN EMPLOY ALONG WITH- WERE MORE- SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THROUGH- NEW INITIATIVES. AND INTENTIONAL PURSUIT OF STATUS LIKE AGES SITE WHICH OFFERS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR FEDERAL FUNDS HELP IMPROVE TEACHING AND LEARNING- TO HELP IMPROVE PRACTICE FOR THE UNIVERSITY. SHOULD BE AN H. ASIDE IN TUITION IT IT'S 30% I BELIEVE RIGHT OF THE OF THE STUDENTS. A RIGHT. PERCENT OF THIS. I HAVE TO BE IN. I HAVE QUITE A TO GO BUT THEY ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ATTEMPT WHERE WHERE MIGHT THEY BE NOW. I THINK THEY MIGHT BE AT. FIFTEEN PERCENT. THE PROJECT WILL CHECK OKAY BUT THEY HAVE A QUITE A WAYS TO GO RIGHT AND THEY HAVE AND THEY HAVE A PLAN. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR HER THANK YOU. QUESTIONS MISTER GALLAGHER. YES ONE QUESTION I HAD WAS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO KIND OF CONNECT ACCESS EXPANSION AND WORK FORCE NEEDS EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. SO MAYBE ARE WE ADDRESSING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN IN AND INCREASED ACCESS BASED ON ANY CORRELATION WITH STATEWIDE OR REGIONAL MARKET DEMANDS FOR WORKFORCE NEEDS YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- YOU WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE FIELDS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE GROWING THAT OUR FOLKS DâN ON. A STATE WORKFORCE NEEDS PARTICULARLY IN HEALTH CARE AND IN TECHNOLOGY- THOSE ARE TWO PLACES WHERE WHEN WE LOOK AT ACADEMIC PROGRAM GROWTH THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. THAT WE'VE SEEN MORE PROPOSALS AND A SPECIFIC INTENTION ON MEETING- THE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION- THEY ARE VERY. FOCUSED ON THE LOCAL MARKET WHAT IS REQUIRED- AND THIS A NEW PARTNERSHIP TO THINK ABOUT- DECREE ATTAIN MY GOALS BEING ABLE TO BRING STUDENTS BACK THAT HAVE STARTED BUT NOT YET COME. THREE AND ALSO LOOKING AT WORKFORCE CREDENTIALS- WHEN WE START TO TAKE A AN INITIAL VIEW WITH THE SEVEN PROPOSALS THAT COME IN. WE CAN SEE THE INTENT IDEA OF LOOKING AT WHAT NEEDED BOTH THE PRO AND CONSIDER BACK WITH A DEGREE THAT WOULD HELP THEM GET INTO THE WORKFORCE AND IMPROVE IN ADDITION TO SPECIFICS OF. THAT NEED SO WE LOOK THAT YEAH. BUILDING HAVE BEEN ON ON THE CAMPUS AS IF MILLION AND ONE FOR GIVES A NOT TO JUMP UP SOME OF THAT WORK AND IN PARTICULAR FOCUS IN AREAS OF BACK UP BRINGING STUDENTS BACK SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETED CAREER BE A COMPLETION PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW YOU BROUGHT UP HERE AND I KNOW SPECIFICALLY IN MY REGION SO REPRESENT THE NORTHERN SACRAMENTO VALLEY. COUNTY AND- MORE THAN CAL GENERALLY LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET RESIDENTS PRO AND CURRENTLY WITH UC DAVIS- BEYOND THAT FRONT IS THAT SOMETHING. THAT MIGHT FIT INTO THIS WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING HERE YEAH AND YOU'RE DOING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT WITHIN THE INFORMATION SENT WE HAVE- STATED THAT. ALLOWS US TO TAKE A LOOK AT BOTH RESIDENTS AND THOSE THAT HAVE GONE ON TO GET A MEDICAL DEGREE TO SEE THROUGHOUT THE- FORM SO THAT WE CAN SEE WE HAVE DOCTORS VETS NUR. BOB IN THE TRAIN NOW WORK IN THE LOWER COMMUNITY AND HOW THAT HAS GROWN OVER TIME. OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK SPANISH LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO OKAY MY DEFINITELY LIKE THE- YOU KNOW MARIN AND GET MORE INFORMATION AND CERTAINLY WORK MORE. ON AND IN MY MAIL ALASKA. THIS COULD YOU GIVE SOME BACKGROUND ON WHERE THE. YOU KNOW THAT THE ENROLLMENT ROWTH AT THE STATE HAS FUNDED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHERE HAS THAT MONEY BEEN ALLOCATED AND MAY YOU PER PARTICULARLY I AM INTERESTED IN- THE CAMPUSES WERE THE HIGHEST DEMAND- AND THE HIGHEST NON RESIDENT. ENROLLMENT ARE THEY BEING ALLOCATED A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE MOMENT GROWTH TO SERVE CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. OF THANK YOU SIR THE NEW STATE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE ARE ALLOCATED THE CAMPUS BASED ON SOMETHING WE CALLED THE REAP BENCHING FORMULA WHICH IS WAITED FOR STUDENT- WHERE UNDERGRADUATES ARE WAITED A ONE GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE LIKE A TWO POINT FIVE FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE FIVE. THE FUNDING FLOWS OUT THE BASED ON THE TOTALNUMBER OF ENROLLMENT ON EACH CAMPUS. A RESIDENT ENROLLMENT ON EACH CAMPUS. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT- THE GROWTH THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TIME SOME OF THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY ARE THE BURKE CAMP SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES THE CAMPUSES ARE IN HIGH DEMAND WE'VE SEEN A SIG GROWTH IN CAL YOU READ STUDENT I'M I'M- I'M NOT A VERY TRYING. IT UP QUICKLY CAN YOU INFORMATION THAT. YEAH AND THAT WOULD BE GOOD I'D LIKE DEFINITE THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT. BUT WHAT I HEARD THERE IS IT SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE BIT. SOUND LIKE YOU'RE OF DOING IT BASED ON WHERE YOU HAVE RESIDENTS RIGHT NOW AND I THINK. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S MANY CAMPUSES THAT. DON'T HAVE AS MANY RESIDENT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO SHOULD THEY BE MAYBE GETTING. THE MORE MONEY TOWARDS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE ROMAN GROSS THEY'RE BAD FOR RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE EARLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S BEING ALLOCATED THE FUNDS ARE ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON ENROLLMENT ON THE CAMPUSES IN THE NEW NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT ACTUALLY TAKE ON. OF AND THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT ARE ABLE TO TAKE ON FAR LESS OF SO EACH YEAR THE CAMPUSES EVALUATE MANY. BUT YOU KNEW. I THINK AND ACCOMMODATE BASED ON THE HIRING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND THE FUNDING THEY THINK THEY WILL HAVE FROM ALL SOURCES. AND BASED ON THAT THEY COME UP WITH OF A TARGET OF WORK WITH YOU CO PIECE THAT UP WITH THE TARGET AND ROLLED. UP IF YOU HIT THAT GET THEM. THE FUNDING. THEY THEY RISK. DON REVENUE STUDENTS THAT THEY IN RAW BUT THERE TO GO THAT TARA OKAY WHO'S HERE THERE TARA. RIGHT AND WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR A MORE THAT FUNDING. OF YOU SAY THAT. A LOT MORE THE RECENT GROWTH HAS BEEN UP THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GROWTH IN SAN DIEGO FOR OUR SIDE. OF THEIR GET THE GOTTEN SOME MORE OF THE FUNDING MORE. BUT WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF ON STUDENTS STUFF WE'VE TAKEN ON IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHERE THE STATE HAS PROVIDED US WITH GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF NEW FUNDING FOR. STUDENTS BUT ACTUALLY OVER AND ROLLED BEYOND THAT. AND SO OUR CAMPUSES HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALL THE FUNDING FOR STUDENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED. SO WHERE WE OVER EMERALD. OF AS A SYSTEM WHERE OVER AND ROLLED BY ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- AND- WHAT CAMPUSES WELL WE DISTRIBUTE THE NEW FUNDING BASE WE REDUCE THE pTHROUGH BUT AT THE CAMPUS SAYS BECAUSE IT'S A FORMULA THAT DIVIDES AL THE DOLLARS ACROSS THE NEW STUDENT. SO IT'S JUST THAT ALL CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN RECEIVING A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GET. OKAY BUT IF FOR. STUDENTS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT CAMPUSES SIR. I GUESS WE ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF ENROLLING P. AND IF THERE IF THERE ARE OVER AND ROLLED. THERE'S CAMPUSES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING MORE OVER AND ALL I GUESS WE WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT TO. ALL RIGHT YEAH I CAN GET TO THE RECENT A ROMAN NUMBERS BY CAMPUS TO SEE WHERE WHERE THERE'S BEEN BOTH OVER IN ROME IT WHERE YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT GETTING FUNDED FOR THAT AND THE- WHERE THAT. ALLOCATED TO ACTUAL ENROLLED FUNDED STUDENTS SAY GUESSES THAT ACCENTS I THINK SENSE KNOCKER THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU I THINK JUST TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE I KNOW YOU'RE ON THIS ISSUE TO MISTER GALLAGHER IT DOES SAY WERE OVER I KNOW THAT YOU SEE CLAIMS WERE OVER AND ROLLED SEVEN BUT I WOULD SAY WERE DRAMATIC. UNDER AND WILL FORGET GRADS GET THE CHART ON PAGE FOUR IN OUR AGENDA I THINK THIS IS THE MOST ELIMINATING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK. IF YOU LOOK AT. THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE'VE INCREASED BY 10% IN THE LAST DECADE ROUGHLY AND FOR NON RESIDENTS WE'VE INCREASED BY ARE TAKING NOTICE OF THIS AND NOW MISTER MARTZ REACHES BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS AS WELL SO THE NOTION THAT WERE ROLLED THAT I DON'T. BUY THAT THE- SAYS CALIFORNIANS. FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE SINCE THE LAST I THINK SIX YEARS ON AVERAGE AND YOU SEE GROW BY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT SO THANK YOU TO THE USE BEAR STILL NOT. MEETING THE NEEDS. CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BUT MIGHT MIGHT TWO QUESTIONS ARE- ONE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE POSITIVE NEWS THAT. THAT UC. BERKELEY AND DAVIS AND I RECENTLY MET WITH UCLA TALKING ABOUT THIS IS. AS FAR AS- PASSAGE HE ON THEIR CAMPUSES THERE'S NOT ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW RIGHT THERE BUT THERE ARE OFF CAMPUS ALL THESE I KNOW AT UC BERKELEY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OVER MIL. PRIVATE SCHOOL- FORMALLY AT ALL WOMEN'S COLLEGES HAVING. SOME STRUGGLES WITH ENROLLMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY AND SO BERKELEY MAKE TAKE OVER THAT CAMPUS WITH THINGS A FABULOUS IDEA I KNOW THEY HAVE SOME. OF THE LAND OF. A I THINK ON MY- OLD I KNOW HERE AT UC DAVIS. WE HAVE THIS AGGIE SQUARE CAMPUS AT OUR MED CENTER HERE IN. IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SACRAMENTO. WE ARE HAVE THE MED SCHOOL NURSING SCHOOL THERE POTENTIALLY BRING OUT PROGRAMS THERE AND I KNOW THAT THE UCLA CHANCER WE MET ON FRIDAY TALKING ABOUT HIS IDEAS FOR THE I JUST THINK THAT'S- WHAT WE BELIEVE THE- KING OUT IN SOME. THIS CAN I THINK WE WOULD. PRE WAR AND FOCUS ON HOW WE INVEST IN THAT WE GET A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AGGIE SQUARE BUT I THINK THAT POTENTIAL IS THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXPAND. AND I KNOW THE GET SANTA THINKING WITH THESE OFF CAMPUS CENTERS RATHER PLACE TO ENROLL STUDENTS YEAH WELL I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HAVING THAT CHANCELLORS HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN THAT MORE THEY WORK START TO GET SOME ENROLLMENT PLAN. THINGS LOOK LIKE OVER THE YEARS IN ADDITION THAT- THEY ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STRATEGIES TO PARTNER WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE MILLS EXAMPLE THAT YOU IDENTIFIED THAT MIGHT. HAVE EXISTING CAPITAL WHERE THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE SO I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE WORK THAT IS- ON GOING IN THE NEXT- FEW MONTHS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. OKAY SITES THAT CAMPUS OF OTHER EXAMPLES WERE YOU LOOKING AT YOU SEE WHY WELL I MEAN EVEN AT SANTA CRUZ THEY HAD A FIGHT A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A PLACE WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER- THE- I KNOW THE IRVINE CAMPUS WHEN THEY HAD SOME OVER ENROLLMENT I BELIEVE THEY PARTNERED WITH THEIR LOCAL BECAUSE THIS. ADD-IT THERE GET THAT WRONG COLLEGES BUT IT ANTI A PROGRAM WHERE THEY WERE. BUT IS A- SO. NUMBER PULLS BUT CAMPUSES ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH WITH EXISTING- EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES THAT ARE ARE NEARBY OR AROUND THE CAMPUS OKAY WHAT COULD THE STATE DUE TO HELP IN THIS IN THIS. LIKE MAYBE WE COULD SEE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO- TO SUPPORT THAT- AND THE STUDENTS THAT ARE THERE I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT STRATEGIES ON OUR CAMPUSES TO TRY TO GET STUDENTS THROUGH TIMELY MANNER AND PARTICULARLY OUR OUR HEALTH FIRST CHEN AND UNDER REPRESENTED WE SEE THAT AS A- SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. SOME OF GROWTH AND SUPPORT STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THEN WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS- THERE WE THINK IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE ENROLLMENT IS ENSURING STUDENTS LEAVE FOR THE DEGREE AND- SO. I TIMELY MANNER. BOTH IMPORT. MORE SHE WAS GET TO THEM IN A BET SO IF YOU'RE A LAWMAKER WITHOUT AT A CSU IN YOUR DISTRICT YOU WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE TO DELIVER A NEW CAMPUS TO YOUR DISTRICT BUT IS THAT THE MOST IF NOT THE THING TO DO CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW AND I THAT WE GOT OUR- PLEASE THIRTY. CAMPUS YOU SEE YES YOU. AND SEE HOW WE CAN EXPAND THOSE AND GROW OFF CAMPUS CENTERS I THINK THAT THAT'S- MORE SUSTAINABLE AND THOSE RESOURCES FOR THAT SO. WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THAT. I'M I'M IN FULL SUPPORT YEAH I THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I THINK AGAIN IT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO GET STUDENTS TO GRADUATE SOONER. THAT TO WOULD GIVE. A POSITIVE OUTCOME TO STUDENTS- AS WELL AS- SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL MORE. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE GRADUATING SOONER- THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON SO FAR AS THE THAT THEY NEED TO DO SO AND THAT THAT. THAT AMOUNT OF STUDENT DATA YOU GET FROM THAT TO FIT YEAR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. NO THEY'RE NOT FACT WHY. THAT THAT HAPPENS THEN. YOU'D HAVE TO WORK MUCH THE WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND FINANCIAL AID. READ MISTER MEDINA TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS CAN CAN FOCUS ON THEIR ON THEIR STUDIES AND NOT HAVE TO. WORK SO MUCH AND GO PART TIME BUT ONE OF THAT THE- PROMISING FOR THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SUMMER EXPANSION. AND WE DID THAT A COUPLE YEARS AGO OUR CHANGE THE CAL GRANT POLICY SO. IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT ENOUGH OR DO WE NEED. THING ELSE TO FOCUS ON. SUMMER BECAUSE THAT AREA YOU CAN PICK UP THE- GRADUATE. THESE TO EXPAND SUMMER SUPPORT- WE RECEIVED THAT TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR- AND CAMPUSES QUICKLY WHAT WHAT WENT INTO ACTION TO RIGHTS. OF PROVIDE OUTREACH AND GET STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO BE INCLUDED- IN THOSE PROGRAMS. THEIR EFFORTS ON GOING TO EXPERIENCE SUMMER STARTS SUMMER BRIDGE TRANSFER EDGE THOSE. FOR TERM PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO GET STUDENTS IN SO SUPPORT FOR OUT. MISS THEM AND THAT EFFORT. THE AND- IT IT IS ONE OF THE AREAS FOR. DO TRACK WE GET A FOR ALSO AT THE SOFT LINING AID IS A COMPONENT TO MAKE SUMMER POSSIBILITY OKAY THANK YOU STRATEGY. THANK YOU YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE TO. YEAH STEP BACK I APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE CREATE PARTNERSHIPS AND- JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW TRYING TO INCREASE OUR OUR OUR OUR- THANK YOU PROGRAMS MORE EFFICIENT BYE BYE GRADUATING PEOPLE ON TIME TO CREATE MORE SPACE. YOU KNOW I AND I ALWAYS BACK TO YOU KNOW MY POINT OF REFERENCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW. THEY THEY THEY TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW IN THE SIXTIES AND THE SEVENTIES THEY ONLY PAID YOU KNOW A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS A TICKET CALL OR- NO. THE AM THEY WOULD BE A LABOR- AND THEN REALLY START STUDYING- IN APPLYING THEMSELVES UNIT BUT THE SOMEHOW THEY'RE ABLE TO GET INTO THE- TO THE UC'S- YOU KNOW WITH. A GROUP TONIGHT I CONSIDER EVEN. TO BERKELEY IN THE EIGHT SECOND. I SAW UP A PART OF THAT. THAT GENERATION WORRY WAS MUCH EASIER FOR MEDIOCRE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF TO GET INTO BERKELEY AT THE TIME. BT BUT NOW IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN IT'S- THE- INCIDENT. PLEASE OPEN IS JUST. MAKING LIKE DIFFICULT A IS TO INTO TO THE USE AND ESPECIALLY TO. NEAR THE MOST MOST COMPETITIVE CAMPUSES OF A BERKELEY UCLA AND SAN DIEGO AND- IT ENDS SO WHEN I WHEN I TRY TO LOOK BACK TO CAPACITY QUESTIONS I THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW THE INTO THE STATE'S POP. A BILL OUR STATE POPULATION WAS A TWENTY TWO MAY. BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND TODAY WE'RE APPROACHING FORTY MILLION IT DIDN'T DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE USE ON RATHER CAPACITY IN IN A VERSE TODAY. AND IF NOT CAN I YES YOU CAN. I WILL SAY I DO I HAVE IT. YOU ABOUT WHAT NEED TO DO THEY GET INTO COLLEGE AND MORE CHEN THAN IT WAS ME WHEN I WAS A STUDENT I WILL SAY ONE OF THE THINGS AND AGAIN WHY THIS YOU SEE TO. IS IMPORTANT IS. SING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES SO ENSURING THAT NINE OF TEN STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO GRADUATE NOT JUST AT BERKELEY OR AT UCLA BUT IT EVEN AS AND IRVINE AND SANTA CRUZ AND OTHER PLACES. AND I THINK ARE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE STUDENTS MORE AWARE ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE ACROSS ALL OF THE- UC CAMPUSES- THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT COME THEIR THEIR THEIR EACH- AMAZING PLACE TO GO. AND BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AND DO SO IN A TIMELY I IS REALLY IMPORTANT. OF STATE PARENTS STUDENTS. OKAY AND I PRE. HELLO UNIVERSITY OF THIS TRY TO RECREATE TO- THEY'VE BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT MORE OPPORTUNITIES- MINERAL LIMITED SOURCES ON BUT IT. IN A MOVIE IT HAS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA EVER CONDUCTED LIKE A- LIKE A LONG TERM ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF LIKE YOU KNOW HOW HOW MUCH. THE INVESTMENTS WERE MADE. A SAY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL CAMPUS CAPACITIES AND WHETHER THAT AS MATCH THE DOUBLING OVER STATE'S POPULATION AND WHAT IT WILL TAKE IN TERMS OF THAT THE COST TO BE ABLE TO A COMEDY THAT DOUBLING OF THE STATE POP HAS THE CALIFORNIA STEP BACK IN. TELL ALL RIGHT SO KIND OF THOSE KIND OF A QUOTE YOU ARE PRIOR THE STUDIES BATH THE LOOK AT THOSE AND ROOM FOR I'VE- I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP. THAT'S FOR SIMPLE MINDS LIKE MYSELF I MEAN IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT HOW THE STATE. STE POPULATION DOUBLED IN THE LAST. FORTY YEARS AND- AND IN- HOW I HOW MUCH IT HAS THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S CAPACITY INCREASED AND- AND TO WHAT EXTENT IT IS THAT A REFLECTION OF WHY IT'S SO DID. TO GET INTO THE- YEAH YEAH YEAH- UP YOU KNOW. ALONG THE LINES OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET INTO- ESPECIALLY ARE- MOST- IT COMPETITIVE CAMPUSES IS COURSE THE ISSUE OF THE ADVANCE VERSUS NON RESIDENTS. WHEN C. V. THE CAPS THAT- THAT WERE ADOPTED FOR THE NON RESIDENT AND RALPH AND BERKELEY ROGER IT SPOT ARE. IN TWO NINE CAL KIDS AND SO YOU KNOW A WENT WHEN I WHEN I CAN'T. YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT BUILDING NEW CAMPUSES OR WE ARE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING BERKELEY AND UCLA THEN THAT'S WHERE I LOOK TO NEXT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR KIDS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO BERKELEY SALE. ISN'T THAT THAT THAT'S A 25% OF YOU KNOW. REDUCTION IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA KIDS RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND TO. THAT YOU KNOW WE IT IS WE I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH WITH THAT MS VERDON IN YESTERDAY YOU KNOW IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN THE STATE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF POIGNANT CAMPS THE MAKE UP. WITH ALL THE COMING. DAYS STUDENTS. ARE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO GET THE UNIVERSITY COUNTY CALIFORNIA BACK TO WHERE WE WERE JUST AS RECENTLY AS TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE WHEN THE STATE AND WRONG LESSON PERCENT YEAH. AND IT I MEAN IT'S-IN NEW ONE HANDED WELL I MEAN THEY CAN'T COMING MORE RELIANT ANOTHER FUNDS SOURCES AND NON RESIDENT TUITION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF IT I'M- SOME OF THE DECLINE THINGS THAT WERE STILL AND FIRST YEAR. TURNING TO ME. FOR THAT. WE WANT TO STEM. AND WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO GET IN THE COURSES THAT THEY WANT TO THE MAJORS THAT THEY WILL INTERESTED IN COMING BACK THE UNIVERSE. AFTER KNOWING WHAT THEY KNOW THOSE RATES ARE DECLINING SO I WORRY ABOUT- NOT JUST ACCESS BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE EXPERIENCES THAT STUDENTS ARE HAVING ON THE CAMPUS AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE FIGURES SHOW AND I KNOW THAT THE- VISIT. OUR LYING ON THOSE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE THERE OKAY- AND- I MEAN I KNOW THAT- AND THEN MS VERDON HAS A TOUGH JOB IN A SHE'S ALWAYS COMING BACK LIKE ASKING. FOR MORE MONEY YOU KNOW EVEN AS A GOVERNOR PROPOSING A 5% INCREASE AND- AND I APPRECIATE THAT I. THEY ARE ALL PROUD OF BEING HOME TO THE INNER TO CALIFORNIA AND YET YOU KNOW I WAS TELLING HER NEED YESTERDAY. FOR ME IT EXCITED YOU TEACH YOU NEVER CALIFORNIA. HE OR THESE GRASS ON THE BOARD ON. STUDENT I WANTED TO. IN A REITERATE WHAT THAT'S HIGH. THE ON ON ON PAGE FOUR OF OUR OF OUR AGENDA- THE CHART AT THE VERY BOTTOM THERE MEANWHILE WHILE YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW YOU WE GO CALVET HAS WE HAVE A SIX DID IN IT BASING THE UNDERGRADUATE. THE CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE PRESSURE. I MEAN WE SEE WHERE YOU YOU KNOW WHO WAS WHERE THE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IT IS I MEAN 10% INCREASE IN RESIDENT ROMAN IN LAST TEN U. VERSE IS A 21002% INCREASE IN NON RESIDENT ROMAN MINUTES. HOW AYE AYE GO TO SIT IN CHAMPION MORE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHEN SUCH A START. AND DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AND YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE GOING TO THE NON RESIDENT NON CALIFORNIA NON CONSTITUENT KIDS. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU KNOW SO DIFFICULT FOR ME TO YOU BUT IT DID TO DO CHMPION- MORE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT WORD IS OUT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S JUST GOING TO BENEFIT THE IS IT A STATE IS NOT AN ART. WE SAW. THOSE TWO. ARE BRING IT WITH CUT BACK BUT OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WITHOUT SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO- TO REPLICATE WHAT THEY'RE PROVIDE THING IT MEANS THAT ALL THE STUDENTS THE CAMPUS AND THE PAT. VIRGINITY AND WHAT THEY DO TODAY. I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PERCENTAGES AND IT'S RIGHT IT'S FROM THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'VE GOT HERE THIRTY THOUSAND MORE ON RESIDENTS OVER THAT PERIOD. TEAM AND MORE IN STATE STUDENTS. BUT THERE THERE HAVE BEEN- CHANGES IN THE GROWTH- AND THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING INTO TO SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS BETTER THAT SO I WORRY ABOUT ACCESS BUT AGAIN I A LOT ABOUT. IT'S A- TO GET STUDENTS. TO THE GRASS IN THE PARK I GET REALLY REALLY. IMPROVEMENTS AND GRADUATION RATES WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON ELIMINATING THE GRADUATION CAP SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO AND IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR PAL OUR FIRST JAN. UNDER IT WILL ONLY. THE DEGREE GO ON THE SCHOOL AND EVENTUALLY GET INTO THE PROFESSORIAL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER REFLECT THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS REALLY CRITICAL AS WELL WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE- CONCERN. I CA EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW. I KNOW THIS REPEAT I'LL BE HERE FROM A GOOD NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW CROWDED CAMP ARE. AND HOW WE HAVE A REAL ISSUE. I FEEL LIKE FIRST. AT LEAST THE KIDS THERE THAT A CONTEST FOR TODAY THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO ATTEND THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS OUT THERE THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL.% AND THAT'S WRONG. LAST YOU KNOW I KNOW. CHARGING AN INSURER CARD. THE HAVE CALLED FOR AND WAS A STUDY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO BASICALLY BITE DOWN THE YOU KNOW TO REPLACE THE REVENUES THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE NOT IS NERVOUS. WHEN A CONTINUE TO SIGN YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT US TO CHAMPION MORE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT'S- BENEFIT CAL KIDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MY MARYLAND. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW THIS IS- WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF BATTLES- AND- HAD THIS REALLY HEALTHY I THINK DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS- FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW OF MY WAYS HAVING WERE. EMPHASIS ALL IS THAT NOT CLEAR. IDEA JUST EDUCATION THE LOAN IS WHAT HELPS- C. O. S. A SUCCESSFUL I THINK OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WORRIED YOU KNOW TWO THREE. IN THE CAMPUS IS IF THERE WASN'T I MEAN MENTAL HEALTH IS AND IT'S NOT LITTLE THAT IS HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE ARE FOR STUDENTS AND SECURITY ANY I DON'T THOSE THINGS ARE. AND THE YEAH- THAT WE WILL TRADE UP SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED- FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESSIBLE AT WHY IT PULLED AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR MORE PATIENCE. I DON'T FAIR I WISH THAT THAT THE MATTER NUMBER BUT IT IT I SEE HELLO STUDENTS BACK BUT NO NOT NUMBER IS AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE LOTS EIGHT IS ALL.FOR TO. IF CONVERSATION WE WANT MORE STUDENTS I MEAN I WISH AT YOU WE WOULD SEE THE IMPACT IMPACTS AND THAT YOU SEE MORE SAID BUT WE DON'T THE TRUTH IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND TAXPAYERS TALKING TWO. OF ALL THE CAMPUS. WHICH IS A THINK IT. THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THE IS IT HAPPENED SEE FOR ELEVEN YEARS I DON'T THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GO TO UCLA OR BERKLEY I THERE ARE BETTER MEET TO DO THAT UNIVERSITIES AND I DO MY BY I'M GOING TELL YOU GO TO YOU SEE AND A BARBARA IS THERE'S RESEARCH PROPERTY. NEXT BEING ON. MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS UNIQUE IS THE- IF YOU'RE URBAN CAMP INTO A THAT IT'S THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE PART OF OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- ENCOURAGE. OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS TO THINK OF THE UC AS A WHOLE THIS IS IT I MEAN IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO UCLA AND BERKELEY IS REALLY WHAT WERE HEARING THE MOST TO US AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN YES% I LOVE THE IDEAS THAT FOUND THOSE CAN'T BE MY PROPER UP BUT IN THE END IT THAT'S THAT. NOT GET INTO THE- SO I THINK THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE MORE HEALTH STUDENT THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND BUT I ALSO THAT IT'S OF DEL BALANCE ON THE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IN THE SENSE THAT UP SOME SUCCESSFULLY PATRICK FARES OR IF IT GEN- IS THERE SO YOU I A PRE RECEIPT FOR IT TO COME MAYBE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT. QUICK QUESTION. GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MERCER JEEZ QUESTION DOES THE- UNIVERSITY HAVE ENROLLMENT TARGETS IN MIND TEN YEARS FROM NOW OR OR TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW WHERE THEY WHERE THEY EXPECT TO BE. NO NOT THAT FAR OUT WE BUSTED INFORMATION FROM THE CAMPUSES TO LOOK OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEAR PERIOD WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING INFORMATION. IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ENDED UP HAVING WITH SOME OF THE CHANCELLOR'S AND THEY HAD WITH OTHER CHANCELLORS TO ABOUT A TO DAYS IN THE PROPER OF. THAT IS THAT YOUR POINT. SURPRISE THAT ARE AT THIS INFLECTION POINT IN THE STATE WE HAVEN'T BUILT ANY- ADDITIONAL CAMPUS THIS WE OBVIOUSLY DURING THE TIME THE NUMBER OF US. WERE AT COLLEGE YOU SEE WAS GOING THROUGH A GROWTH SPURT YOU SEE WAS GROWING SO- OF COURSE AS THE POPULATION WAS GROWING THE STEVE KEEPING PACE. I THINK QUESTION IS DIVERSITY TO RECEIVE. HAD ABILITY TO CAN TEAM TO KEEP PACE IT SEEMS LIKE. THINGS HAVE SORT OF FALLEN BEHIND- IN IN THIS IS NOT JUST A YOU SEE IT'S ALSO WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MUCH OF OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WE SORT OF HAVE NEGLECTED OVER THE LAST COUPLE DECADES SO WOULD YOU SEE NOT. ALONE IN THAT AT ALL IF YOU WE- THE DOOR. THE EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN SORT PLAYING CATCH UP FOR A DECADES OF NEGLECT IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE- ON. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR. YOU SEE TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF A IN ROLE MEANT- TARGETS THEY CAN HIT IT EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT- I. YOU KNOW GO GO BACK TO MY FROM SANTA BARBARA'S COMMENTS I THINK YOU KNOW SHE SHE IS RIGHT- THAT WE DO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO- ADVOCATE FOR THE OTHER SEVEN EPISODES. I THINK I THINK THE GOOD THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD NEWS IS I THINK THE SECRETS OUT I THINK THAT I THINK ALL SEVEN OF THOSE CAMPUSES ARE IN HIGH. I MEAN DO I'M BERKELEY IN USED. THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND ALL SEVEN OF THOSE CAMPUSES- I THINK THAT'S A GREAT I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR OR FOR THE STATE OF. IT'S CLEAR THERE'S STILL MORE TO MAKE A UC DEGREE REGARDLESS OF CAMPUS ON THERE THE- SPOT AT ANY IS REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR IN APP BERKELEY WHERE I YOU'RE A BURST. SO I THAT IS THE VERY. I'M I DO THINK YOU KNOW I'D BELIEVE THAT YOU CAMPUSES HAVE BECOME ADDICTED TO OUT OF STATE ENROLLMENT. I DON'T THINK IT CONTINUES TO BE A FAIR. STATEMENT THAT OUT OF STATE IN ROMAN INCREASES. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF IN STATE SUPPORT IN FACT SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WAS- STARTING IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR THE END OF TWENTY TWELVE. EVERY SINGLE YOU SEE HAS RECEIVED AN INCREASE IN INCREASE IN SUPPORT. YET IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART IN TWENTY THIRTEEN EVERY SINGLE YEAR WHILE THE STATE INCREASED THEIR SUPPORT TO THE UNIVERSITY WHAT HAPPENED. WELL FOR NOT CURSE IN STATE AROMA WAS FLAT. INTEL MYSELF AND MR MCCARTY ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO GET IN STATE ENROLLMENT UP THE WAS NOT BECAUSE UNIVERSE DECIDED TO THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY THE SHADE IN THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS BUT- THE CHANCES ARE VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. OUT OF STATE MOMENT. SO I THINK YOU SEE NEEDS TO BREAK THE ADDICTION OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. OR THEY NEED TO PAY THE STATE BACK FOR ALL ITS BUILDINGS ALL ITS LAND. ALL THE INVESTMENTS STATE. BECAUSE TO ME IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO BREAK THAT ADDICTION TO OUT OF STATE STUDENTS THERE ARE THERE HAS TO BE A CHANGE IN THE RELATIONSHIP. SO TO ME THIS YEAR I I'VE ALWAYS I THINK YOU YOU SEE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THE STATE HAS EVER DONE AND I CONTINUE TO STAMP. ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IS PROBABLY MAYBE EVEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST CONTINENT. IN THIS WORLD. IT'S A REASON THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN TALENT GROW OUR OWN TALENT INNOVATE- SO MUCH OF. WHAT HAS. BEEN INNOVATIVE IN THE STATE HAS COME OUT OF A UC THIS. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTE CREDIBLE BUT- I MEAN I THINK THAT TWO. TWO THINGS IS. WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT YOU SEE IS PREPARED AND PLANNING. TO MEET. D. DEMANDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE DEMANDS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND FRANKLY DEMANDS FOR A VERY VERY EDUCATED WORKFORCE WE LIVE IN A VERY EXPENSIVE STATE. WE COMPETE YOU KNOW GOV GOVERNOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT A LOT LIKE WE DON'T COMPETE. ON PRICE. WE LOSE THAT COMPETITION. WE COMPETE. BASED ON GETTING THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COME TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE CHUNK OF OUR ECONOMY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE REAL PIECE OF OUR COUNTRY THAT YOU SEE IS THE PART OF THE DIFFUSE CARE CONTINUE TO. EDUCATE IN KEEPING MAINTAIN THAT EDUCATION CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO CONTEND IN OF IT. AND I THINK ALSO IF IT'S- IF IT IS HE DOESN'T HAVE ROOM FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH THOSE CALIFORNIA'S SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GOING TO GO TO TEXAS THEY'RE GONNA GO TO MASSACHUSETTS THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO IT ANNOYED GOING TO. NORTH CAROLINA. CREATE GEN THEN TACK IN FLORIDA NOT IN SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT TO US I THINK IS EVEN THOUGH THE LARGER CONCERN- AND I IF THE UNIVERSITY- DOESN'T OUT IT UP AGAIN WHERE WHERE I THINK WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK- WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON DEVELOPING A LONG. TERM THEY TOOK ALL THE BACK THERE WE HAVE GOTTEN HAS- TO ME NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNIVERSITY SERIOUS ABOUT BREAKING THE CYCLE AND BREAKING THEIR ADDICTION- BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY INTERESTED IN THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE VERY INTERESTED. BECAUSE THEY THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PAYING TAXES KIDS CAN'T GET IN. TO DO YEAR END INTO THE UNIVERSITY. SO TO ME- YOU KNOW IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT- THAT THIS SORT OF SORT OF ENROLLMENT LOOK BE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO. IT'S. YOU'RE HAVING ALSO QUESTION ABOUT SAY THAT JUST TO STEVEN THAT THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND OR IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. TWENTY EIGHT- THE TWO THOUSAND. YOU KNOW OUT OF STATE STUDENTS THOUGH THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THOSE COULD BE CALIFORNIA'S LOTS AND AGAIN. WHAT NO NO ONE POINT OUT IS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF OUT OF STATE A ROLE THAT IS NOT A U. SEAMERS AT. WHERE WORK WITH THANK YOU SEE ELECT THAT UC SAN DIEGO. SO THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF. IT'S B. AS YOU KNOW- IN THIS IS A JOKE IT'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE BETTER OFF MOVING TO NEW YORK. WHEN YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL BEEN TRYING TO GRADUATE FROM CALIFORNIA TO GET INTO BERKELEY. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT US TO TELL OUR CONSTITUENTS MOVE OUT OF STATE. SO YOU CAN GO TO UC BERKELEY. WITHOUT A STATE SO YOU CAN GET INTO UCLA. THAT THAT SOUNDS. LIKE A VERY POOR WAY TO DO IN ADMISSIONS PROCESS FOR IN IN STATE. YOU NEVER. BUT THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE ARE AT AT THIS STAGE IT IS SOMETHING THAT TO ME IS. NOT ALL. IT'S NOTHING THAT I CAN TELL MY CONSTITUENTS I CAN'T GIVE THEM THE ADVICE TO MOVE OUT OF STATE TO GO TO THE COLLEGE THAT THEY'D LIKE TO. BUT THAT TOWARDS CHOICE WOULD YOU STARTED. LEAVE MANY OF US. SO AGAIN I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO. HIGHLIGHT HOW MUCH EACH OF THE CAMPUS'S CAN GROW. WHAT THE CAPACITY IS YOU KNOW NOT JUST A FOR YEARS BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING TEN TWENTY YEARS. AND ALSO. HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE. ABLE TO HAVE- ADMIT THE GROWTH IN ROLE THE GROWTH IN IN STATE CALIFORNIA'S CUSTOMS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK A LONGER TERM FUNDING PLAN IS A GOOD IDEA THE PRE FUNDING THAT WE HAD IN THE LAST PERIOD IS IT IS VERY HELPFUL- CAMPUSES KEEP AND TO PATE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TERMS OF SLOTS AND- UP ACCORDINGLY IT TOOK OVER A PERIOD THAT IN TALKING ABOUT. THE CITY OF FORMULA HAS AND DID THE TARGET. WHAT WE WERE GETTING IN TERMS AT STATE. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- SO IT ISN'T AS THOUGH OVER THAT PERIOD WE DIDN'T ENROLL AS MANY AS SLOTS AS WE WERE GETTING PAID FOR BEING ABLE TO THINK AHEAD ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS- AND BEING ABLE TO PLAN TOGETHER AND KNOW THAT THE- RESOURCE WELL. WILL HELP THE CAN'T. WITH WITH MEETING DRUNK WHICH WHICH WHICH HAS BEEN GREAT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY- YOU KNOW IT HERE TO THE AGREEMENT THE BUT LET'S JUST BE CLEAR THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED ON TO THE UNIVERSE CAME TO US AND SAID HEY WE HAVE THIS GREAT PLAN. FOR IN STATE AND WOMEN AND WE WANT TO INCREASE NUMBER CALIFORNIANS. NOBODY CAN TO TALK ABOUT. ALL THE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW CAN WE INCREASE MORE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE LOVE THE MONEY. IN FACT IT WAS COMMITTEE- THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT. YOU SEE WAS NOT ONLY ADMITTING HE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS FOR THE MONEY THEY IN FACT WERE GIVING SOME OF THEM SCHOLARSHIPS THESE WERE NOT ATHLETES WERE TALKING ABOUT. THEY WERE GIVING. PRESSURES FINANCIALLY DOLLARS TO OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. SO THE YOU KNOW YOU SEE WAS BECOMING THE UNIVERSITY OF NON CALIFORNIANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. BUT IT BECAUSE WE TOOK ACTION AND WE FORCED YOU SEE BACK TO ITS MISSION. TO ADMIT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT A START DOING THAT. SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE WE'VE THIS COMMITTEE'S BEEN ASKING FOR A ROMAN PLAN I THINK I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. AND WE ASKING. FOR A PLAN. TO IN ROLE MORE CALIFORNIA'S TENS AND WE'VE BEEN ASKING. FOR HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST. OUT WE GOT A PLAN IN TERMS OF INSTEAD OF BUT THAT TO ME IS NOT COMPLETELY WE STICK THINK AT LEAST AS A STARTING POINT. FOR DISCUSSION GRAVERT PLEASE BY THE- AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO GO BACK ANDDUST OFF. IT'S SORT OF FOUNDING DOCUMENTS AND LOOK BACK AT ITS MISSION. IN THE MISSION IS TO FOR THE MISSION WAS TO BE- THERE'S A LAND GRANT UNIVERSITY TO DO AMAZING RESEARCH IN AND- HAS BEEN. CONTINUOUS AND IS TO EDUCATE. THE GREAT MINDS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS IT M. IN MOST OF THIS YEAR PROBABLY MOST OF US UP HERE I MEAN I'M JUST LOOKING AT ALL OF US UP HERE HOW MANY DOES HAVE YOU SEE DEGREES SURE MANY PEOPLE. YES ALL. YOU DON'T CAN ANYONE PATH THIS THIS WILL BE A DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE THERE AND WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN YOU GO TO OTHER STATES. WHEN YOU GO TO OTHER LEAD AS THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OPTION AND WHAT'S MADE OUR STATE. RATE THIS MADE OUR STATE DIFFERENT. BUT WE ABSOLUTELY THIS IS THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE DOES HAS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. POURTANT YOUR WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS WOULD YOU SEE DOES SHAPES THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND THAT PEOPLE CARA. SO MUCH. IT SHAPES WHETHER PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THE STATE. THE CHIP BUT PEOPLE COME WORK IN THE STATE. IS SHAPES KIND OF INDUSTRY BE IN THIS STATE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. IN AND THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATURE'S FIGHTING FOR OUR STATE BAR CONSTITUENTS FOR OUR RESIDENTS FOR FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS BECAUSE WE- TO ENSURE THAT YOU SEE DOES NOT FORGET ABOUT THEM I KNOW THERE ARE STUDENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THERE'S TEN FORTY NINE OTHER STATES WHO WOULD LIKE I'M HERE. THEN WE WELCOME THEM TO COME. BUT THEY DON'T ALL GET TO COME TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT WHERE THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP. CELL AND THEN THIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DEPARTURE ON THE MISSION AND WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD. LOOK IN THE MIRROR. BREAK ITS ADDICTION TO OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. AND REMIND ITSELF. WHAT IT'S HERE TO DO. SO THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- I CONCUR WITH 99% OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID I DON'T WANNA GET. YES OKAY BACK WHEN WE DID SERVICE YEARS ON THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE I'M YOU YOU- WENT ON THIS FOR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU KNOW. WE'RE TING AND I WERE WERE BANG ON TWO THREE FOUR YEARS AGO AND- NOW THE PRO TEM OF THE SENATE POSTED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR BY POP. ALL ACROSS LET. IS SPOKE ON ISSUE I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON A LITTLE POSITIVE THING SO WE DO KNOW THAT. BECAUSE OF THAT. IT'S NOT NOT CAP I CALLED A FORMULA AND AS MISTER MARTZ WHICH IS SAD. DEPENDS ON WHAT CáC. ARE BUT% USED HYDRO THE- EVERY NON RESIDENT YOU GET FOUR MORE CALIFORNIANS AND SO. THAT IF NOTHING ELSE CHANGES IN THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOU WON'T SEE THESE NUMBERS. SEC DEPRESSING BECAUSE THERE WE ARE DEPRESSING AND I I'LL CONCUR THAT YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO THIS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON DURING THE RECESSION. AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE. IS THAT A CRAZY TIME IN THE REGION ST PAUL'S THIS IS A THREE LIKE IT'S ARE YOU BY THE UC STATE ON MY STATEMENT BE. SOON FEE MONEY. THAT CONRAD. STATE IN NEW STATE MY AN YEAH TOWN AND YOU GO EACH KILLING INCREASE TUITION SO MUCH. AND SO WE DID THIS FOR COUPLE YEARS A LITTLE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON BUT AFTER WE STABILIZED AND I'VE BEEN GIVING MORE THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE PAST FIVE SIX YEARS WE'VE DOUBLED AGAIN NUMBER NINE RIGHT THAT'S WHAT MAKES A MISTER MARK. SCRATCHER HOW DO YOU CAN FOR MORE. SEE MONEY SAYS OKAY. BEEN GIVEN. WAY MORE MONEY A YEAR AND ALLOW. SIX SEVEN YEARS WITH A DOUBLE THE NUMBER. OF NON RESIDENT. IS CUTTING INTO A SPOTS AND SO JUST THAT'S- US AND OUR CONSTITUENTS RIVER. I'M I WILL SAY TO THAT IF WE HAD A SUITCASE RIGHT HERE OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT I THAT. DOWN BACK. NOW I DON'T I DON'T. EDUCATION FINANCE A LATE SO I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT EVEN IF WE HAD THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT NOW WE WOULD GO AND BUY BACK. WHERE WE WERE TEN YEARS AGO TO GO BACK AND PERCENT I THINK IF WE- HAD LIMóN UNLIMITED RESOURCE YEAH BUT I THINK YOU TO EVALUATE- OPPORTUNITY COST AT BUT I KNOW WE HAVE. JANET TODAY AND THIS. ONE OF ANY ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE SO OF MISTER MEDINA. YOU KNOW I EIGHT. THE GREE WITH SOME OF- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH HAS THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF COLLEGE GOING RATE ALONG PROBABLY WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF A- BACHELOR DEGREE IN POPULATION. I'VE I REALLY DO NOT HERE A CLAMOR. FROM MY CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY FELT SO STRONGLY THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO UCLA. CAL BERKELEY I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR TWENTY SOME YEARS. AND I SAW WERE STUDENTS UP WENT TO COLLEGE IN EVERY YEAR OF A GRADUATING CLASS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS I THINK THE GRADUATING CLASS OF POLY HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE WHERE I TAUGHT. WITH ONE TO COLLEGE. YOU KNOW AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY YOU KNOW FIVE OR SIX. MAY GO TO UCLA. YOU KNOW MAYBE TWO OR THREE THE CALIBER GLEE. OF ONE OR TWO WOULD GO THE IVY LEAGUE COLLEGES- BUT I DON'T HEAR I DO NOT HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM. I THINK MORE IN TO THEM IS THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY BECAUSE I HEAR FROM MOTHERS WHO COME TO MY OFFICE AND TELL ME YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS ONLY TO WAREHOUSE WORK. NO THEY- A COLLEGE TO GO TO HAVE A BETTER FUTURE. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AT UCLA OR OR CAL BERKELEY. BUT I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE UC SHOULD BE YOU KNOW FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT THAT THE SORT OF WAS RAISED AND YOU KNOW WHERE WAS CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SO I WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION DO YOU SEE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OR PICK ANOTHER DECK. BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF UC'S BUDGET WAS PART FUNDED BY THE STATE IT CALIFORNIA. THAT SHIFTED. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE UC BUDGET THAT WAS PARKED THE FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW IS THAT CHANGE OVER TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER MEDINA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY- I THINK WAS CLOSE 280% OF THE UC'S BUDGET WAS COMING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THAT POINT IF EVEN OR ODD DO THE EXACT NUMBER. IF I COULD A MENTAL BUT ON THE COST PRESSURES THAT WE ARE FEELING LATELY- AS A SYSTEM WE HAVE SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BEEN RECEIVING A LOT OF. MONEY FROM OF. FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR SINCE TWENTY TWELVE YOU BE GIVING US INCREASES. BUT ONE. THAT WE HAVE. FOR MANY ON A SINCE THEN IS ARE RICH. PROGRAM IN THE TWO AN EIGHT NOT BASH ARE. PROGRAM COLA STE AND WE HAVE HAD TO START PUTTING TRUMP. THE MONEY INTO IT EVER YEAR THAT ACTUALLY GO PROVIDE ANY NEW SERVICES ON THE CAMPUSES. YOUR PROGRAM AND REALLY IF WE WANT TO DEAL WITH FUNDING AND CAPACITY ISSUES ON THE CAMPUSES WE WOULD FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH OUR- TOWARDS US. WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT LESS MONEY EARLY AND WE COULD USE THOSE FUN INSTEAD FOR CALIFORNIA ACCESS. WHAT WHAT WHAT AN AGE OF THE UC'S BUDGET TODAY IS- STATE FUNDED. A TODAY WHERE THE 42% STATE FUNDED PARKOUR CAMPUS OPERATIONS 42% ASTRID. OVER THAT WAY THE DIVISIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY OF ALMOST NINE HUNDRED. THAT THE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. YES THANK YOU CONTINUE MR MEDINA I ACTUALLY GET A JUST ON THAT POINT THE- SO IF YOU INCLUDE FINANCIALLY WHAT WOULD BE THE PERCENTAGE OF STATE FUNDING THAT THAT SUPPORT SERVICE OF TWENTY STUDENTS. I DON'T HAVE NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME I'M SORRY. WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE NUMBER THEM- IF THE ISSUE IS HOW MANY COMING BILLION IN THE CORE. A NUMBER OF THE ABOUT OF. ALMOST FOUR POINT NINE BILLION OKAY SO. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY SO ONE BILLION MORE. 20% MORE. BUT TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE WHERE IS THREE OF US TO TELL BUT THE BATHROOM O THE TO THE CAN WORK OR DO TO OUR- YOU YOU CAN SEE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE BUDGET HAS DECREASED. OF SUPPORT. UC RIGHT IT IS. DRAMATICALLY YEAH YEAH AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL GENERAL FUND BUDGET YEAH ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT HOW MUCH WE'VE BEEN SPENDING ON CORRECTIONS SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES STRONG CORRELATION RIGHT THERE RIGHT BUT I AND I MEAN THE PERCENTAGE STATE BOARD. TO OUR FOR OF BUDGET BUT- PERCENTAGE OF THE BY THAT IS BY THIS BY THE IPHONE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT. PERCENT AGAIN WE NEED. SIR CRISTINA GARCIA THE MATH PROFESSOR HELP US BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S WELL OVER 50% IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE MONEY BECAUSE- BACK. TO THE STUDIO COMMISSION THEY WRITE A CHECK TO THE UC FOR ABOUT A BILLION. TO SAY THAT'S NOT ME I THINK IT BEING INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST AND SO WE NEED COULD COUPLE ALL THE MONEY FROM THE FUND THE GO. THE UNIT. WE HAVE. QUITE A FEW MORE SO. I WANT TO GET A THANK YOU.

AS REQUIRED THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES PASSED A POLICY ON RE DIRECTION IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FIRST FULL REDIRECTION TERM WAS. TWO THOUSAND NINE. TO FALL OF NINETEEN IN THIS. THREE FOR TRANSFER APPLE THAT SEEING A LEGIBLE BUT NOT ADMITTED TO ANY CAMPUS THE APPLIED REQUIRE BY SB FOURTEEN FORTY. THE NEW ROOF RACKS POLICY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REDIRECTION TO FIRST TIME FRESHMAN AND TRANSFER APPLICANTS AS WELL AS THE- FOR TRANS CSU I'LL- BUT NOT ADMITTED TO AND CAMPUS THEM I'D- START APRIL. NINETEEN WE STARTED MEETING WITH APPLICANTS THAT THEY WERE STE THEY STILL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK CSU COP CAMPUS THAT STILL HAD. A CITY WE CONSERVE PARTLY ME FIVE THOUSAND APPLICANTS BE EATEN UP TAX MATH THIS. NOT CSU THIS STILL HAVE AVAILABLE. WE SENT ME MESSAGES TO THIS GROUP OF APPLICANTS AND PROVIDED TO CSU WEBSITE THAT ALLOWED THEM TO EXPLORE THE NINE CAMPUS I. OF THE FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WERE INITIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR REDIRECTION EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO APPLICANTS ULTIMATELY ENROLLED AT A CA. ES THIS EQUATED TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT YIELD OVERALL. YIELD FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WITH POINT 2% COMPARED TO ONE POINT EIGHT. PERCENT FROM PRESS. ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT HE DID THE CSU CHANCES ARE. PROCESS WITH CAMPUSES AND INTERNAL STOP TO DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. AS THIS PROCESS NEW FOR CSU FOR TIME FRESHMAN APPLICANTS AND THEIR COUNSELORS AND FAMILIES WILL BE INCREASING OUR COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION EFFORTS FOR THIS POPULATION. THIS IS ALSO FOUND THAT PROVIDING DEBT WEBSITES AND A PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT FOR WAS IMPORTANT TO CONNECT THESE STUDENTS TO SPECIFIC AREAS ON CAMPUS SUCH AS FINANCIALLY AND HOUSING. INCLUDE THE CSU WAS WORKING TO PROVIDE ACCESS AND MEET THE REGIONAL NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT I'VE TAKEN ALL THE RIGHT STUFF TO PREPARE RECALL IT. IN TWO. IT WAS FUND AND ROMAN GROWTH BROAD TUITION OFFERED IS ALLOWING THE CSU TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S NEED FOR AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE AND TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE THE US AND GLOBALLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO NEED RESOURCES FOR THAT WE CAN CALIFORNIA. AT THE- THANK YOU EIGHT PROPERTY WITH YOU THIS MORNING. THANK YOU I'M RAIN STORM ALSO FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET NOT JUST HERE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THE RIGHT. BACK ON TRACK HERE. ONCE AGAIN YOU SEE IN ALL OF THE TENSION. I DON'T SEE AS YOU THAT AT TIMES RIGHT. YES EXCEPT OVER DOLING OUT THE BUDGET ALLOCATION. WHAT'S YOUR FAIR SHARE TO SELL ALL START OFF WITH THE- THE QUESTION I ASKED WITH YOU SEE ABOUT. OFF CAMPUS AND- WELL I THINK THOSE ARE VERY TO PROMISING IDEAS DEALING WITH. ACCESS AND THEM LOOKING TO EXPAND ASSIST EXCESS ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL GRADUATES- START WITH THE SUMMER. WHAT ELSE COULD WE BE DOING TO HELP MAKE THAT A REALITY DEAL WITH THAT. SITUATION IS DEPENDENT AND AGREE I'M TO GET DOWN TO FOUR YEARS. FOR SUMMER TWO WE WILL BE OFF. NINE CAMPUSES APPROXIMATELY SIX DOLLARS TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOL SO THEY SHOULD HELP SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING A CLOSER. ALSO SOME OF. EXPLORING XP CSU FULLY ONLINE TO SUMMER THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE ONLINE CLASSES DURING THE SUMMER SO. WE HAVE NINE CAMPUSES BE SUPPORTING FINANCIAL AID AND STATE SIDE SUMMER COURSES THIS YEAR. YOUR THING TOO IS THAT WITH THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WE RECEIVE SINCE THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION WE'VE HAD FORTY ONE THOUSAND SPOTS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY YOU OVER THE YEARS- CAMPUSES WHAT WE DO WE ALLOCATE THAT. THOSE ENROLLMENT TARGETS ARE THOSE NEW SLOTS TO CAMPUSES THEN AS YOU SEE IT THERE IS A- CITY FOR DO SUMMER COURSE OFF. THEY WILL LAUNCH THOSE OVER ON THAT SO WE DON'T DIRECT THEM FROM THAT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AT THIS POINT TO DO SO. BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF A THE GRASS ROOTS OF. ARMS OF IF THEY IDENTIFY PARTICULAR PER ROOM THAT MAKES SENSE TO THEM THAT THEY'LL WATCH THAT WITH THERE ARE SOME RUMBLINGS OF PARTICULAR CAMPUSES THAT ARE KICKING THE TOP. LEAVE A STATE SUPPORT. PROGRAM ISN'T CASE FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. SO AS ROAMING GROWS WE ARE- SEEING THAT THERE'S MORE OF AN APPETITE- FOR CAMPUS IS TO SHIFT. SOME OTHER ENROLLMENT TO THE SUMMER WHICH IS GOOD FOR. YOU KNOW. ADDRESSING CAPACITY NEEDS AND THAT SORT OF THING SO I THINK TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU HAVE THE FINANCIAL. PIECE YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL ROAMING GROW. IN ACTIVITY CAMPUSES I THINK I THAT'S THAT'S A US IN PUTTING IS THE WRITER OKAY HOW ABOUT THE OFF CAMPUS. CENTER DISCUSSION. THROUGH ANOTHER THERE IS TALK ABOUT A NEW CSU STOCKED IN AND I THINK SANDRA DINO YOU KNOW GET UNLIMITED RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE NICE BUT- IF THAT'S- THE BEST THING WE SHOULD DO OUR BIGGEST BANK BACK WITH LIMITED RESOURCES AND SO I THINK. WE'LL FOCUSING EVERYTHING SOON THROUGH. BUT WE HAVE SOME OF THESE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND- YOUR TALK ABOUT THAT. TWO ONE. SURE OKAY NOT AT THIS TIME THE CENTERS IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FROM AN ACT TO EAT PERSPECTIVE TO EXPECT AND CENTERS THAT IT IS EXPANDING EXISTING EMPHASIS SO CENTER BEING USED ALERT MEANS SPIT. ALSO IT WHAT I JUST READ SPECIFIC PART OFFERED OUTS BUT ON. CAMPUS LOOK TO OUR PARTNER WITH OTHER SCHOOLS KIND OF HOW CAL STATE SAN MARCOS START STATE SAN MARCOS ACTUALLY STARTED AS AN UPPER DIVISION COURSEWORK AND IN. ON LOWERED OF COURSE WERE TO BECOME A FOR FULL UNIVERSITY BUT I THINK CAPACITY ASSESSMENT STUDY WILL BETTER HELP US UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THE- AS- WHERE THOSE. MIGHT AND I THINK OVER TIME WHY YOU HAVE THE CENTERS TO BEGIN WITH IS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN AYE IF I DEMAND. PARTICULAR CAMPUS THAT'S IT YOU KNOW LINKED WITH SAN BERNADINO THEY HAVE A EIGHT HUNDRED OF ALL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT OR THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN MORE OF A DEMAND AND. MORE AGGRESSIVELY PERHAPS- BUT THEN ALSO THEY THEY DO UTILIZE THEM JUST IN GENERAL- BECAUSE THERE ARE PARTICULAR NEEDS ON US CAMPUSES. THANK YOU. IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY I THINK YOU GAVE THE FIGURE THAT ONLY 4% OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE RE DIRECTED RESERVE OF APPLICANTS. AND THE GOAL TO IT'S WHERE THEY BEEN RE DIRECT THAT. YES ABOUT FOUR FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT ULTIMATELY ROLE EVEN THOUGH ALL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WERE ULTIMATELY RE DIRECT TO A CAMPUS RIGHT SO BUT ALL 4% OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE READ ACTED EVENTUALLY AND- AT WHAT ISSUE CAN. STATE SO BROWN OF BY TWO WHERE THEY APPLY SO THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT EXACTLY THE REASON WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS DIDN'T COME UP TO XIN. OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS WHEN WE LOOK THE CALIFORNIA REFERENCE THEY WERE SEVENTY SAID ABOUT 77% OF THEM ACTUALLY WENT TO ANOTHER UNIVERSITY OR IF YOUR ARE CAN YOU CALL IT. SO THE- BUT STUDENT BUT HE IT LOCALLY ACT MUCH HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER STUDENTS THAT ARE AT TEN LOW% EIGHT SO ALL STE ARE. DOWN WITH THIS. SO IT WASN'T. BECAUSE THEY THEY COULDN'T GO TO SOME OTHER PART OF THE STATE THAN TO ATTEND. THANK YOU. OKAY YEAH THE QUESTIONS GALLAGHER QUESTION YES STRONGER. ALSO THE. DONE. ONE QUESTION I HAD WAS AROUND THE AT T. S. IN THAT PROGRAM NOW THIS YEAR ESTABLISHING- ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFERS. RIGHT NOW IMPACTION OBVIOUSLY IS AFFECTING UC CAMPUSES BOTH UC AND CSU CAMPUSES BUT MAY MOST ESPECIALLY CSU CAMPUSES. AND IT DEPEND ON WHETHER THE IMPACTION IS BY CAMPUS OR BY PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO ANSWERING YOU KNOW AS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE POLICY TO PROVIDE ADMISSIONS PRIORITY TO STUDENTS RESIDE HELLO SERVICER. AND YOU IF I HOW THESE ACTION POLICIES ALSO AFFECT EIGHTY TEAS- THEY'RE TRYING TO TRANSFER INTO THE CSU SYSTEM TO THEIR LOCAL CAMPUS. FIRST SO EIGHTY TWO USED ACTUALLY GET TWO BOMBS AT THEY ARE LOCAL AND APPLYING TO WIN IMPACTED PROGRAM SO THAT A TRANSFER STATE THAT HAS AN EIGHTY E. THAT IS A- ONE EIGHT PROGRAM. MILLER SO THE MEANS I HAVE SEEN COLLEGE COMMUNITY CALL AND I CLIMBED A PSYCH PRO AT THE CAL STATE THEY ARE RECEIVE UP. THE EIGHT AS WELL AS THE PRIORITY BUT- THEY WERE APPLYING TO A SIMILARPATHWAY AND APPLYING TO THEIR LOCAL CSU OKAY SO THAT GIVES A MAYBE AN ADDITIONAL PRIORITY IS ANOTHER WE'RE- YEAH IF THEY HAVE AN EIGHTY T. AND THEN ALSO WITH THE AT T. PROGRAM IF THEY'RE APPLYING ON THE SIMILAR PATHWAY. THEY COME IN WHICH YOU'RE STANDING AND THEY ONLY HAVE SIXTY UNITS TO FINISH THEIR DEGREE. OKAY. AND I MISSPOKE GRAND OF UC DOESN'T HAVE INTERACTION AND SEE AS HE THAT DOES IMPACTION RIGHT. BUT I SEE THAT CONTINUES TO BE KIND OF A TOUGH ISSUE FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GUYS DECLARE AN IMPACTION EITHER ON THE CAMPUS OR- IN A PROGRAM. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S IT KIND OF PUTS A STRANGLEHOLD OBVIOUSLY ON PEOPLE BE ABLE TO GET IN. YOU GUYS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW TO KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SURE SO. CAPTION PROCESS IS ACTUALLY- STATE MANDATED FINALLY- ADD CODE EIGHT NINE ZERO THREE ZERO POINT FIVE AND SO IT'S REQUIRED THAT EACH CAMPUS TO ANNUAL REVIEW OF THEIR IMPACTION PROCESS IF THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE. AN IMPACT IN CHANGES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO PUBLIC. TRUST SO HE WAS THE WRAPPING UP THEIR PUBLIC HEARINGS ABOUT NOW FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR. MOST RECENTLY ACTUALLY THEY GAVE THE TREND HAS BEEN TO DISCONTINUE IMPACTION SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR- FALL TWENTY ONE WHICH IS WHAT THE- OUR OF. AND LIGHT THROUGH EIGHT. SO NOT MUCH WILL BE DEBT IMPACTION FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN HUMBOLDT WILL BE DISCONTINUING BIOLOGY BOTANY ZOOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT. SEND A BAIT. EWING BUSINESS CAN YOU JIM. ACTION BY SCIENCES THAT SACRAMENTO HAS PLAN IN PLACE THE THREE YEARS FULLY AND- SO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A LOT OF DISCONTINUANCE OF IMPACTION IN THIS IS BASED ON THE ANNUAL WERE VIEW AND THE PLANS THAT THE CAMPUSES HAVE TO PROVIDE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I WOULD HAVE. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. THE WITH MANY YEARS IN A ROW OF SUSTAIN FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY. DESHAWN ROLE THAT SLIDES THAT GET. IS MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE ABILITY EDUCATE MORE. AND I'M PROGRAM ALL IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THAT CRISIS OF THE DAY YOU HAVE A SITUATION NOW WHERE OVER TIME BEEN LETTING MORE AND MORE OF THAT IMPACTS AND THAT'S TESTAMENT TO YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE NUTS GET IS EIGHT. TO HEAR THE AS OUR DRESSINGSHOES AND CERTAINLY OF HAVE DONE A LOT TO HELP ADDRESS THE ENROLLMENT ISSUE. ON THAT SUBJECT HOW THE GUYS USE YOUR ENROLLMENT DOLLARS HOUSE THAT BEEN ALLOCATED. YOU KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY TEACH CAMPUS AND I'M KIND OF INTERESTED OBVIOUSLY IN THOSE HIGH DEMAND IS HAVE YOU. AND THAT PURPLE LOOKING AT YOU DID DO THE MOST WORK IN OTHER WORDS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVE YOU DONE THAT OF YOU TO. THAT I COULD PREPARE AND LOOK AT MY NOTES ON. SO WHAT WE DONE. THAT THE BACK UP OF FOR IS WE'VE AT IT FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ANGLES AND IT'S NOT CLEARLY A PERSONAL ASPECT SO IF WE RE STATE INCREASED 1% ENROLLMENT INCREASE NEVER EMPLOYED THAT ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. ANY VERY SMALL QUE RIGHT CAN'T DID SAY IN THAT IT WAS IN THE MID NINETY I THINK IS SAN MARCOS- WE ALSO CHANNELIZED SO ONE OF THINGS WE SAID OKAY FOR ONE OF THE- IS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT FOR SMALL THIS IS A SMALL STUDENT SHINS THANK TO GROW THEIR CAPACITY. ON THOSE CAMPUSES- THE OTHER THING TOO IS WE'VE OBVIOUSLY- LOOKED AT- DEMAND AT THOSE HIGH- THOSE HIGHLY DEMANDED CAME THIS RIGHT SO THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES THE SAN DIEGO. ALCOHOL THESE THE LONG BEACH IS THOSE OF ALL I COULD HAVE RECEIVED INCREASES ALSO UP THE ONE THING THAT HAS TEMPERED A LITTLE BIT OF THIS TO IS. AT THIS BILL MASS. INTER PHYSICAL PLAN IN ITS INSTANCE WE HAVE ACT RUN INTO THAT CAPACITY THAT THAT CAP SO. A MASS AND PHYSICAL MASTER PLAN IS DEVELOPED AT THE LOW LEVEL BY THE CAMPUS. APPROVED BY THE BOARD PLEASE. HELP IN CONCERT THE LOCAL YEAH RIGHT. AND SO I'LL BE YOU WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IT CAN. GO FROM SAY A TEN THOUSAND. CAMPUS TO A THOUSAND CAMPUS RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S- THERE'S TRAFFIC IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. SO IN SOME IT SAYS ON ON THINKING TO- CAL POLY AS WELL AS WITH FULLER TEN. IN CHICO THE SICK AND- IS A LITTLE LIMITED AMOUNT. AT THE START. WITH US IS SPACES TO EDUCATE STUDENTS AS AS WE WOULD LIKE AND THEN ALSO BE THE MASTER PLAN SO TO SPEAK SO WE HAVE TEMPERED IT DOWN AND I DON'T WANT IT IS A SAYS I A- IT'S- TAKEN. FOR A THE FRONT. ADDING A THEIR- IN ANY OTHER FOR ANOTHER FACTOR THE HAS KICKED IN IS THAT AND HAS ACTUALLY A ON A BIT OF A DIP IN ALASKA HAVE HERE'S- PETER. CALIFORNIA YEAH IN IN IS SET IN AT HUMBOLDT AT MARITIME WE HAVE NOT INCREASED IN ENROLLMENT AT ALL BECAUSE THIS THOSE PARTICULAR CAMPUSES ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THE AND TARGET SO WE DON'T IT IS WRONG THAT'S MY NOT. AND THAT THERE IS A HUGE POPULATION ONLY A FINITE CAMPUSES AND THOSE CAN'T IS A RATHER LARGE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW SO THAT KIND OF UP. PIECES I MATHEMATICAL EXERCISE A STRATEGIC PLACEMENT OF NEW ENROLLMENT TO MEET PARTICULAR NEEDS ON THOSE CAMPUSES. ALRIGHT. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE FIRST OF ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- HOW YOU. STARTED OFF YOUR PRESENTATION. THE FALL. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COVER VERSION WITH. YOU KNOW YOU TALKED OUT TO EXPAND DRAMATICALLY INCREASING YOUR YOUR ENROLLMENT- WHERE IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO NEW CSU CAMPUSES ARM HI I'M LOOKING AT. ARE A MATERIALS HERE THE CASE THAT CSU AS- INCREASED ITS UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT BY NEARLY EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND- IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IT DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE THE- OKAY ALL RIGHT. WE ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF ALL THAT INFORMATION SO OUR RATES GOLDEN. AND YOU KNOW FOLLOWING ON OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RESIDENT VERSUS NON RESIDENT- DO YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM WIDE WHAT A PERCENTAGE OF CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. AS A STUDENTS OR- FROM OUT OF STATE OR NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. SO OVERALL IT 6% I 2% OF WILL AFFECT TAKE THAT 6% OF 40% OR 2% OF THOSE ARE DOMESTIC SO THE FROM OTHER STATES OF THE P. SIX. RED OF THEM ARE. AND WHAT PAYING THE EIGHT IN RED STUDENT ENROLLMENT FROM FAULT TEAM PAUL TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN A DROP IN. EIGHT HUNDRED I'M CONVINCED. SO WENT FROM. HE SAID HOUSE IN A RANGE THAT TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN CHANGE. AND YOU THE DEBT TO CAL STATE HAVE A SIMILAR- FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO TRY TO RECRUIT AN INCREASE THE- THE NUMBER OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS NOT PARTICULARLY THERE'S NOT A LOT THAT COMES IN TO PLACE AND WE HAVE. SPREAD OUT OVER TWENTY THREE CAN. SO NOW THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN TERMS OF WHEN WE ALLOCATE MONEY FROM THE STATE AND BALLOTS THAT WITH TUITION WE NEVER FACTOR IN NON RESIDENT TUITION BECAUSE AT THE CSU WE TREATED MORE AS LIKE THAT THIS IS A GOOD HAVE A WE HAVE. NOT IT'S IT FLUCTUATES A LOT FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR WE HAD AN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS TO. SOMETHING HAPPEN THE BRISE ECONOMY ALL OF OUR INSTANCE. FROM SO IT'S VERY TENUOUS IT BOUNCES AROUND QUITE A BIT- I THINK WE ONE OTHER THING THAT'S BEEN FACTOR IS A SINCE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAME AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DISTANCE STUDENTS COMING TO. HAVE AS POINT SO THAT'S- ATTEMPTING SORT OF. US AND THEN- AND THEN YOUR EVERY FROM FALL EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN PARTICULAR. MAYBE MISSION THAT BUT I'M NOT WHY ARE. IT AS MUCH AS A DAY. BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE DEPENDANT ON A THAT WAY WHY WHAT IT WHAT ARE TUITION LEVEL DO LARGE COVER THE COST OF THEIR INSTRUCT. WELL IT'S FUNNY MAKING AND FOR THAT POINT SO. HOW MUCH DO YOU TO. NON RESIDENT STUDENTS SO WHAT THEY. STUDENT SO THEY PAY TO PIECES- THEY PAY- FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN AND FORTY TWO FOR THE TUITION PIECE WHAT THAT EVERYBODY PAYS. AND THEN. WHAT WE DO IS WE CHARGE NOT REST IT'S ON A PER UNIT THEY TAKE. AND MOST OF OUR STE ON RESIDENTS TO ARE ALL TIME EQUIVALENTS. SO WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND ENDS UP BEING ABOUT THE- TEAM TO A INTEL'S LIFE ABOUT A THOUSAND. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO THE CAUGHT. THE COST OF IT XIN BUT IT'S CHEN. LINE WITH THIS OF THAT THE FOR INSTRUMENTS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF DETERMINING COST OF INSTRUCTION SO. BUT SO OF THE RIGHT THIS IS A YOU GET THE DOLLARS PER. NON RESIDENT STUDENT MORE THAN A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT GENERALLY YES OKAY AND YET WE WILL HAS BEEN TREND ARE YOU YOU SAID THAT THE TREND HAS BEEN. CLIENT ON RESIDENTS IN SAID THAT UP THE REST YEAH I JUST THIS FALL OVER FALL WE HAD A HUNDRED. A FEW STUDENTS ARE THIS IS. SIMILAR TO THE DIVERSITY CAL ARE THERE ARE CAMPS IS HAVE A HIGHER. OF NON BY TO THAN. YES THERE ARE AS SENATE BILL IN SAN DIEGO. AND WHAT ARE THE PRISON OF SANDERS MIGHT BE UP TOO IF I'M NOT I THINK FROM OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION FROM ME BUT I THINK TELL. JENS YOUR CLOSE TO FIFTEEN BUT NOT FIFTEEN THEN SEND THIS JOSE I MENTION IT BUT IT'S NEVER GET LOWER THAN THAT. SENATE SINGLE BIT BUT- MOST THEIR CAMP. IT'S EVERYONE A SAFE ARE RUNNING A BUT NOT A STEW POPULATIONS THAT MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE. VERY AND IN. MEETING BURKE. IT'S A THE COMMENT WAS MADE OR THAT THAT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE LAW PROVIDER OF CAL TEACHERS ISN'T A ALSO THE FOR OR ENGINEER. I ON DON'T KNOW OKAY I BELIEVE UP I HEARD THAT IN IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS CAL SALE BEACH- BRAGGING ABOUT HOW TO PAY- TURNOUT MORE ENGINEER NAY THE POOL IN AND CAL BUT I- I THINK THE- A GOOD THEY CAN. I MEAN AS WERE TO ABOUT THE NEED TO EDUCATE TO. OUR FEE WORKFORCE IN A TO- TO HIGHLIGHT HOW. STATE UNIVERSITY. EDUCATE CALIFORNIA KIDS TO BE PART OF OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE THE REASON WHY I HESITATED REPLYING TO USE THAT THE FACT THAT WE- PREPARED AND DESCENT IT MAY BE TWO THREE FOR YOUR- OKAY. BUT WORD. YOUR VOLUME AT THE C. ISSUE YOU NAME THE PROFESSION WERE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SERVE THE DEGREES RIGHT JUST BY. THE SHEER NUMBERS YEAH BUT WE COULD DEFINITELY DOES STOP THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO YOU NO PROBLEM OKAY IT ANY CARE THAT OVER. YOUR ASSIST WIDE GRADUATE SINCE OUR FIRST GENERAL TO THAT'S CORRECT. ALL RIGHT OTHER OF FOR THIS PANEL SO NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YOU. NEXT WE'D LIKE TO INVITE THE COMMUNICATE LET'S WRAP.

ACCOUNT STUDENTS A YEAR HE QUIPPED ABOUT THOUSAND FULL TIME TO. AND COUPLE OF OUR BIG THAT ARE READ IS ARE A- TWO FOLD IDEA ATTAIN ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR A HAVE CALLER NO DEGREE COMPARED ABOUT 22% STATE WHY. AND THAT CLOSE TO SEE ISSUES ABOUT FIVE MY SOUTH DOWN AND SHE- AND ASSIST YOU SEE IS YOU SEE DAVE ABOUT HER FIFTY SO. BUT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING TO SERVE OUR OUR AREA BETTER AND TO BUILD OFF OF WHAT TO MY COLLEAGUE I SHARED WITH YOU- HI I HAVE A ONE COLLEGES UPS- SUMMARIZE FOR YOU UNTIL IN ROMAN THING YOU CAN SEE THE GROWTH IN THIS PROGRAM. ALSO IN OF A- BIRD. WE WERE THAN TWENTY FIFTEEN IS HELP SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THIS PROGRAM. BUT FOR OUR REGION- WE'VE GONE TO OVER. THREE THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NOW DO OWN ROLLED IN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TAKING FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS COURSES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR- GIVING THEM A HEAD START IN. A AND NOT COLLEGE- YOU CAN SEE THE CHART ON HOW MANY SECTIONS- WE HAVE BEEN OFFERING. THE GREAT PART OF HIS PROGRAM AS I LOOK AT IT IS UP 299% DISTANCE THROUGH THE VERY FEW STUDENTS DROP. OF THESE COURSES AND INTERVIEW THAT TO OUR GREAT INSTRUCTION AND IN THE TORY HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE POLICIES. AND THEN- OVERNIGHT 2% ARE ARE HAVING SUCCESS IN THEIR COURSES SO FAR- OVER THAT FIVE YEAR TIME PERIOD. AND THAT COMPARES TO AROUND SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF COLLEGE WIDE OR SUCCESS RATES- AND SO THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH. RATE EMPHASIZING LIMIT MORE ABOUT THE OF PROMISE PRORAMS AND THE INCREASE- WE'VE SEEN THERE AND STUDENT PARTICIPATION- WE START IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK TO AUTOMATE FINANCIALLY PROCESSING. MEETING IN HAND HAND THE WORK AND YOU CAN SEE WE'VE HAD A- OVER A COUPLE YEAR PERIOD OF FIVE POINT 6% INCREASE IN PELL GRANT. STUDENTS IN ORDER PROGRAM NOT TWENTY THREE PLUS PERCENT INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANTS INS- FORMALLY THE BUG FOR. PROGRAM AND WE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO OUR COULD WORK OF OUR FINANCIALLY STAFF AUTOMATING PROCESSES MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS. QUICKLY HIGHLIGHTING- AND IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD ARM ROMAN HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT SO IT'S NOT A GROWTH IN NUMBER OF STUDENTS- IT'S JUST GETTING MORE THAN THEIR AID THIRD. HIGHLIGHT OUR- PROGRAM WE CALL STEP UP WHICH STANDS FOR SHASTA TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM UNITED PARTNERSHIP. LONG NAME- BUT WE STARTED IN THAT TWENTY FOUR FIFTEEN WITH A SMALL PROGRAM. AND THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SHERIFF AND PROBATION AND SHASTA COUNTY NOW WE'VE EXPANDED OTHER PARTNERS LISTED THERE IN YOUR HAND OUT. WE'VE EXPANDED NOW TO- HAVING A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX- FORMAL INCARCERATED STUDENTS IN THIS PROGRAM- SUCCESS RATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO OUR DISTRICT WIDE SUCCESS RATES- AND THE BIG THING- THAT I'M REALLY PLEASED TO REPORT ON IS THE RECIDIVISM RATES IN THE STUDENTS WE- NOW OVER THROUGH. DESPITE IN THIS. PRO AND A FIFTY ONE. HAVE BACKSLIDING I GUESS ALL SAYING AND OTHERS ONLY THIRTEEN POINT% MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT I'M TOLD- THE TYPICALLY IS FOR US STUDENTS IN THIS LIFE SCENARIO. THE THIS IS A- TO EXPAND THIS BECAUSE OF ANOTHER INNOVATION AWARD WE RECEIVED- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO- HAVING THAT SPECIAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE EXTRA SUPPORT THE STUDENTS NEED TO SPEND A KEY PART OF. OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND. OUR FOURTH PROGRAM I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT BRIEFLY IS WE CALL OF XCELERATED COLLEGE EDUCATION OR ACE UP ITS CHEST THE COLLEGE. WE BUILT THIS PROGRAM OUT OF OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN INNOVATION AWARD MONIES TO IN IN THIS EFFORT. AND ACTION YEAH GOT A TWENTY SEVENTEEN INNOVATION AWARD. BASED ON THIS SO- KIND OF FUN TO- TO SEE THAT TO BUILD ON ITSELF- THE MAIN IDEA HERE IS A REALLY STRONG GUIDED PATHWAYS FOR RETURNING ADULTS LET'S INVITE THEM BACK TO FINISH THEIR DEGREES BUT NOT TO THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE THEY HAD. THAT LET PERHAPS LEAVING- ATTEMPT SO THESE ARE ALL SET UP TUESDAY THURSDAY IN COURSES SOME ONLINE COURSES EIGHT WEEK SESSIONS SO EIGHT WEEK AND FALL OFF NAY WE GOT YOUR BERMAN WITH FOR. HIS TWENTY SIX. COURSE GRADES OVER THE FIRST TWO TWO AND A HALF YEAR PERIOD AND THIRTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE CRAZY LATELY WERE STUDENTS IN THE ACE PROGRAM GETTING THE EXTRA SUPPORT AND BECAUSE WE'RE OPEN AT THE OTHER HALF PEOPLE JUST IN. FOR THAT. YOU ME EXT. SEE MY REVIEW. NINE PERCENT- COURSE EXCEPT IN THESE COURSES AND FOR THE BASIC PART OF THIS AND THEN FOR THE OTHER TWO JUST HAPPENSTANCE HAPPENED WHEN ROLL SEVENTY NINE SO- WE ATTRIBUTE THAT TO THE ORDER. IT'S EVENT IS. AND YOUR OWN NEEDING THREE MORE WEEKS COMPLETE A CLASS RATHER THAN SAY TWELVE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO STICK IT THROUGH RATHER THAN THAT GIVE UP. THAT'S ANECDOTAL NOT STUDY ONLY AT. FROM THE STORIES THE STUDENTS TELL US THAT WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING FIFTH ITEM ON THE BACK PAGE- JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF OUR GROWTH AN ONBOARDING DEGREES AND- PLEASE THE SHOW. IF WE WENT EVEN FURTHER A. B. EVEN. PRESS BUT- YES- AN INCREASE IN DEGREES BEING AWARDED. THANKSGIVING AT T. AND I. WHAT I DIDN'T ADD IN HERE IS A NEW EFFORT WE STARTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WERE COLD. ABOUT A FIVE PERIOD AND FOUND ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS- WHO HAD SIXTY PLUS UNITS BUT WERE AWARDED THE DEGREE. AND WE WENT BACK AND READ WAITED THEM AND FOUND TO LEARN THIRTY PLUS OF THEM HAD A DEGREE THEY JUST NEVER APPLIED FOR IT. SO IT'S KIND OF. IRONIC WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERYONE KNOWS TO APPLY TO COLLEGE. WE HAVE THESE INTERNAL. BOTHER WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE TRANSFERRING OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO- WE'RE GOING BACK IN AWARDING THEM THEIR DEGREES THAT THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED PROGRAM DEGREES WHEN. FOR A- AND NOW IT TAKES TO MORSE USING UC'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE FINALLY- PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY A YOU HAVE A NEWSLETTER HAND OUT HERE- A PROGRAM I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT- THE STATE IS MAKING AND- ADDRESSING FORCE MANAGEMENT AND THE OVERGROWTH IN. VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE- WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL LANDING NOW- A SUB GRANTS AND THEN A DIRECT GRANT UP TOTALING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT HIRE ADDITIONAL FACULTY- AND- SUPPORT. EXPANDING OUR EQUIPMENT GRAHAM INTO- AGS FOR HEAVY EQUIPMENT. INTO A LOGGING CERTIFICATE AND BUILDING IN OUR MENTAL. FOR FROM SPREADING AS AS- QUICKLY AND HEAVILY. TIED TO THIS WAS OUR- WORDINGOF A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR A STATE GRANT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE FOR NONTRADITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WHERE WERE ABLE TO- GIVE STUDENTS OF THE PRACTICAL MORE STUDENTS THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY. PAID EXPERIENCE ON THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT WERE PART PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS PROGRAM. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR REGION ESPECIALLY AFTER THOSE DEVASTATING. FINAL NOTES JUST MENTIONING- WHERE WE'RE GOING NEXT TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND- OUR PILOT PARTICIPATION IN THE BACCALAUREATE- CALIFORNIA CAL'S BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IS WERE EXCITED ABOUT- I SEE THAT AS A POTENTIAL WAY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MORE BACCALAUREATE SHOULD WE GET. EXPAND BUILD REALLY WRONG PROTECT PROGRAMS IN OUR- ARE- APPLIED BACCALAUREATE APPROACH TO UP TO MEET INDUSTRY NEEDS IF ALLOWED. AND THEN. ALSO WERE- IN PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING MORE COMPETENCY BASED OR A CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO HELP THEM. GAIN SOME FOR LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MILITARY WHEN THEY HAVE THE BACKGROUND OF ALL THE TRAINING THEIR RECOGNIZING THAT CREDIT MORE READILY- OR DEGREES AT AND WHEN THEY COME TO US. SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS AND I WOULD BE RUDE NOT TO MENTION I'M SURE REDDING WELCOME IN A PENSIONS FROM YOU SEE YOUR SEATS YOU. AND THAT'S- WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR GALLAGHER. YEAH I MEAN JUST A LOT THERE AND I MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THERE THAT I THINK. VERY PROMISING THAT WERE SEEN AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND I THINK YOU KNOW OF HE SAW A SNAPSHOT HERE SHASTA COLLEGE IN SOME I THINK SOME PRETTY AWESOME THINGS THEY'RE DOING FROM THE STEP UP PROGRAM- TO ACES.

YOUR HIGHLIGHTS SIR TRUCKING A TRUCKING OBVIOUSLY A BIG A STILL VERY MUCH A BIG EMPLOYMENT SECTOR AND AT THE TO HIM THE CAMPUS I KNOW THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS OF. HAVE FOCUSED ON. YOU KNOW AS WE DISCUSS THE PANELS HERE AT YOU KNOW AT. MORE MORE I SEE ACCESS. THAT THE ANSWERED ACCESS IS THAT THE CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND EXPANDING IS PROGRAMS AT THEIR DEEP I THINK WE CONTINUE TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY A WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE UC LEVEL. AND WE'VE SEEN THE PROGRESS THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING. ARE PAYING MUCH MORE FOR- WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WITH THE CSU SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR IS AT T. L. ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT AGAIN THE AT T. IS A SEEM TO BE. WORKING PRETTY WELL I THINK YOU BY THE OME OF THESE I KNOW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. PATHWAYS IN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS BUT THERE'S OTHER DISCIPLINES RIGHT NOW THAT YOUR SUPPORT YOUR LOOKS POINT ALIGNMENT WITH- DO YOU MAYBE WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE AND PARTICULARLY. I THINK WHERE WE FOCUS ON THE WORK FORCE WHERE WE HAD THE DEMAND FOR WORK FORCE EDUCATION. WHERE WE CAN HIGHLIGHTED WHERE SOME OF THOSE REGIONAL TRENDS HERE RECENTLY ONE JUST THAT DAY COMES TO MIND FOR ME IS WE KNOW WE NEED TO GET INTO OUR FORCE YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. BUT TREE TRIMMING AND- ARBORISTS THAT WE THEY WERE GONNA NEED TO HELP CLEAR UTILITY LINES- ENSURING THE SAFETY OF OUR OF OUR GRID. I KNOW BUTTE COLLEGES HAS BEEN SENT ONE BEEN INTERESTED IN TRYING TO SET UP A PROGRAM AND THAT RESPECT ANY A LOT OF PEOPLE TO IN THE- IN THE- FOR BUT MAYBE IF YOU HIGHLIGHTED OF. THINGS WERE YOUR YOU. THE C. THE COMMITTEE THIS IS TRYING TO. FIND THOSE PATHWAYS WITH THIS WITH THE EIGHTIES. WELL I'LL I'LL BRIEFLY MENTION WE HAVE NOW OVER TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY TEAS- APPROVED THROUGH OUR PROCESSES SO THERE ARE. MANY OF THOSE FIELDS LIKE PHYSICS MATH. PSYCHOLOGY AND MANY OTHERS- AND SO- AND THEN THE ON THE WORK FOR SIDE MY THOUGHTS AND I'M GOING TO THE STRONG FORCE INVEST THE STATE'S BEEN MAKING AND COMMITTEE COLLEGE TO THEM AND HOW- HELPFUL THAT'S BEEN- FOR OUR COLLEGE TO IT- DO MORE AND DO. CRITICS TRAINING SO. IT'LL OF FOUNDING A- OUR SYSTEM PROGRAM- AND- WE'VE EXPANDED. WORK IN THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEEN A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THESE OTHER GRANTS WE PAD- TO EXPAND OFFERINGS THERE- AND MANY OTHER FIELDS IN CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION THE SPORT OUR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROGRAM- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY TO TRY TO MEET THE NEEDS- OUR LOCAL INDUSTRY- SORTS OF- ARE BUILDING EACH OTHER- IF YOU WANNA ADD MORE. YES AND THANK YOU. SOUND LIKE CHESTER WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF OUR COLLEGES DO- GREAT WORK REALLY FOCUSING THEIR PROGRAMS ON THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND REGIONALLY ADOPTED- WITH REGARDS TO EIGHTY TEASE OUT SOME CHANGES MADE- THAT ARE ENABLING. MORE AND PATHWAY APPROACHES ARE ONE- THAT HAD SB FOUR FORTY WHICH ALLOWED CAREERS AND- DEGREE CLUSTERS WHICH MAKE THESE TRANSFER PATHWAYS MORE ADAPTIVE TO WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED I THINK WE'RE WE'RE STILL FINDING IS THAT- WHILE THAT'S BEEN HELPFUL- ARE STRONG WORKFORCE PROBABLY BEEN MORE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE CUTE OF WORK FOR. A PROGRAMS THAT ARE NEEDED IN REGIONS PARTICULARLY LIKE SHASTA PROGRAMS LIKE THAT- THE CALIFORNIA- AT A PRACTICE SHOULD THEY SHOULD IS FOCUSING ON NEW AND EMERGING INDUSTRIES- IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S AREAS THAT HAS. FOR ADDITIONAL INVEST IN THAT BUDGET. SO THOSE ARE OF THE SPACES WHERE WE'RE SEEING- OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ADAPT TO WORKFORCE NEEDS. OKAY THANK YOU. THIS MUST THE PRESENTATION BUT SHOW BECAUSE I READ WITH GREAT I KNOW WHAT I GO BACK TO WATCH THE VIDEO. OKAY THANK YOU. TO OUR NEXT PANEL THIS IS. WITH THE ROLE OF OUR PRIVATE NON PROFITS IN INCREASING CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. A GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME'S ALEX GRAVES- BEHALF OF THE ICC YOU WHICH REPRESENTS EIGHTY FIVE INDEPENDENT. NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE STATE WERE AS FAR NORTH AS READING AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO WE HAVE A BRICK AND MORTAR INSTITUTIONS ONLINE PROGRAMS HYBRID PROGRAMS EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. COLLECTIVELY WE EDUCATE A HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. OVER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE UNDERGRADUATES ARE CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS AND WE ALSO EDUCATE OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ADULT LEARNERS- AS OF OUR LAST CAPACITY SURVEY A FEW YEARS AGO. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS WERE OPERATING AT ABOUT 86% CAPACITY WITH AN ABILITY TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN THOUSAND. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. AND I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THREE POINTS BEFORE TURNING IT OVER TO PRESIDENT JOHNSTON MY RIGHT. FIRST IS THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION REPORT NOTES AVAILABILITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION CLOSE TO HOME MAKES COLLEGE GOING MORE ACCESSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. AND WITH EIGHT FIVE INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE BELIEVE OUR SECTORS WELL POSITIONED TO OFFER STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME. WHETHER THE ANNUAL STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WELL THROUGH A TRANSFER PATHWAY. OR READ HIGHER. IN THE DES. IN OUR INSTITUTE OFF NUMBER TRANSFER PATHWAYS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND LAST YEAR WE ENROLLED OVER SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS. IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN A I SEE SEE YOU PRESIDENT KRISTIN SOURIS AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR YOU LIGHT ORTIZ OAKLEY. SIGNED THE MASTER AND- YOU FOR THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER OR AT T. JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER THIRTY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS BEGAN ACCEPTING AT T. APPLICANTS TO ARTICULATED PATHWAYS. AND AS OF THIS PAST FALL THIRTY NINE INSTITUTIONS ARE ACCEPTING- AT T. TRANSFERS. WELL THESE PATHWAYS ARE STILL RELATIVELY NEW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN OUR REVIEW OF STUDENT MOVEMENT- WE FIND THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO A ICC INSTITUTIONS CLOSE TO THE COMMITTEE CALLED FROM WHICH THEY RECEIVE THEIR AT T. INDICATING THAT THE- P. IS. WRITING REGIONAL ENTITIES FORCED TO CAN YOU THE CRASH TOWARDS ABOUT HIS DEGREE I AND ONE OF THE HAVE NOTS IN YOUR FOLDERS SHOWS THAT STICK MOVEMENT FOR PRESENT PACIFIC UNIVERSE THE- AT. PAPER FROM. BEST PERSON. INSISTS THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS. PER THEM IS AN AFFORDABLE OUR INSTITUTIONS DO A TREMENDOUS JOB OF PROVIDING ROBUST AID I PROVIDING ON AVERAGE OF OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR AND INSTITUTIONAL GRANT AID TO A CAL GRANT RECIPIENT. PROVIDE TIMELY POUTS HE'S OUT WITH 64% OF CAL GRANT STUDENTS GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS AT A RELATIVELY LOW COST TO THE STATE. I AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AROUND CAL GRANT REFORM ARE IMPORTANT AND MANY ASPECTS OF THAT WAS- PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED WOULD BOTH EXPAND ACCESS. ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT AID THEY RECEIVED- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE FURTHER LEVERAGING THE CAPACITY AT OUR INSTITUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE REFER. POLICY IN IT THE CALPERS FOR STUDENTS ATTEND OUR INSTITUTIONS IS NOT SUBJECT TO DISCUSS BUDGET THAT'S AN ANTI AS IT IS THING LAW. I DID THE STATE COULD FURTHER BUYS THE REGIONAL CAPACITY OUR INSTITUTIONS BY SIMPLIFYING OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES BE I WON THE STATE AS OF LAST YEAR PROVIDES ADDITIONAL ALL CAL GRANT SUPPORT TO. AS STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU SEE YOUR CSU. I AND WE BELIEVE THAT MAKING THAT ADDITIONAL AID AVAILABLE TO CAL RECIPIENTS AT OUR INSTITUTIONS WHILE THEM. ACCESS THE INSTITUTIONS IN THEIR REGION AS THEY LOOK CAN YOU THEIR POWER. DEGREE ALSO WHERE THERE IS MENTION SUMMER CALGARY WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF A DEEPER SUMMER. BUT LIKE THE STUDENT PARENT ISSUE- THAT FUNDING WAS ONLY MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ATTENDING YOU SEE YOUR CSU. AND WE BELIEVE THAT CAN HELP INCREASE EFFICIENCIES HELP STUDENTS GET TOWARD THEIR DEGREE. MORE QUICKLY- WHICH THE STATE ANY AN- ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO JOE JONES PRESIDENT OF FRESNO PACIFIC CARE AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF A I SEE SEE- YOU MEMBERS- INSTITUTIONS FRESNO PACIFIC UNIVERSITY IS HERE TO REPRESENT THE STRESS OF PUBLIC AND INDEPENDENT NON PROFIT COLLEGE UNIVERSITIES PARTNERSHIPS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I UNDERSTAND ONCE SAID THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME THINKING WE USE- WHEN WE CREATED THEM. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO BUILD A EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME OF THE BEST EDUCATION IN THE WORLD. THEY SUCCEEDED IN BEING E. UC'S I SEE ISSUES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IT'S NOT A FIRM THE VALUE INDEPENDENT A UNIVERSITIES AND- COLLEGE SECTOR BUT DID NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN OF A THREE LIKE IT'S TO TESTING OF. ALL ONLY THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. OFF I FIND THAT WE OFTEN FORGET THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE EIGHTY FIVE. PLUS PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AS A MAJOR THREAT AND A APPROACH TO EMPOWERING CALIFORNIA. WE UNDERSTAND THAT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IT IS A KEY ELEMENT IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BUT SELDOM RECOGNIZE THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS SERVE AS A FOURTH LAKE TWO OF THIS TOO IN THIS EDUCATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE STATE. WE SOME HOW FORGET THAT THE INDEPENDENCE PRODUCED TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE BACHELORS DEGREES IN THE STATE AND OVER 50% OF THE GRADUATE DEGREES. AND A DISPLAY I DESPITE PREVIOUS OR REDUCTIONS IN CALGARY IT'S A FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO CHOSE TO ATTEND THESE INSTITUTIONS STILL PROVIDE THE HIGHEST GRADUATION RATES IT IN THE LAST STEP SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATE GRAY PATIENT RAKES IN STATE. OF THESE A PRE PRODUCTION IN ASSISTANT DID NOT KEEP US. DID NOT PREVENT FROM OF. THEIR SUCCESS. MY TODAY IF THE BROUGHT THE STRAT FOR COME FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THAT REQUIRES SHIFTING OUR PERSPECTIVE- AND IN TERMS OF FUNDING JUST THE THREE LIKE IT'S TOO BUT THINKING ABOUT I FOR LAKE IT'S TOO. YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED TO TD PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BETTER PREPARE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE'RE LOCATED. BEATS AIMS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. WHICH TODAY HAVE RESULTED IN K. THROUGH A SIXTEEN COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH FULL PUBLIC PRIVATE. OCCASIONALLY S. SINCE. OUR FOCUS MOVES BEYOND JUST THINKING ABOUT THE IN VISUAL INSTITUTIONS BUT OUR TARGET ON THE NEEDS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. CAL GRANT NOT- OF OUR INSTITUTIONS IT IS A THAT BROUGHT AND STAY OPTIONS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. WE HAVE CREATED GUIDED PATHWAYS TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH A INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS. A IN THIS ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGE YOU CAN REGION WE ARE TURNING AWAY THOUSANDS OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS FROM FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE WE NOW LACK THE CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER. SB YOU FRESNO PACIFIC BILL PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR REGIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES SEE ISSUES AND YOU SEE MERCED. WE ESTABLISHED TRANSFER PATHWAYS AROUND THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR A TRANSFER WITH THE ELEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. VISITING MANY OF THOSE CAMPUSES AND AN ENROLLMENT EXPRESS. EVENT WHICH ALLOW STUDENTS TO- INTERESTED IN TRANSFERRING TO REGISTER FOR CLASS RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID AND MEET WITH AN AXE GIVE US ALL ALL IT SINGLE AND- ONLY TAKING A COUPLE HOURS. OF THE TWENTY ONE EVENTS HI A LAST YEAR- WE ACTUALLY HOSTED FEES THAT ELEVEN DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHICH A TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND ANY TRANSFER STUDENTS TO OUR UNIVERSITY. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH- FRESNO STATE TO FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS IN THE VALLEY WHO WANTED A FOUR YEAR DEGREE- WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCEPTANCE BUT TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF DUE TO IMPACTION. WE BUILD A PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU SEE SAID TO CREATE A STREAMLINED XCELERATED PRO. TO TRANSITION BEST STUDENTS INTO OUR TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. WE HAVE SHARED SPACE WITH BAKERSFIELD COPS AND FRESNO CITY COLLEGE TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR GROWTH AND SPACE NEEDS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH REAL COLLEGE. I TOO LOST BIG PATH THAT'S WITH PROGRAM. CAMPUS FIVE GREEN AS A WITH THE EIGHTY T. VISIT NOT A CHEAP REPRESENT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AVAILABLE THROUGH A PRIVATE INSTITUTION COMMITTED TO THE WELL BEING OF STUDENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS I SUGGESTED EARLIER IN QUOTING ALBERT EINSTEIN WE CANNOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME THINKING WE USED WHEN WE CREATED THEM THE FOR THE FOUR YEAR INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY STILL. AN OPTION FOR. IMPACTION ISSUE BUDGET AND CAL GRANT IT NOT BE UP CUTTING ONE LEG OF THIS AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. BUT TO ALL STUDENTS IF WE SENT YOU INSTRUCTING THE WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US TIME TO HEAR. QUESTIONS HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN YOU QUITE OFF THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE ON THE CAL GRANT ISSUE AND- SEC THAT ISSUES. CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO YOUR LIKING AS FAR AS THE MAXIMUM AWARD FOR PRIVATE CITIZENS AND WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE TO ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT 14% CAPACITY. ABOUT MUCH OF THE PERSON. YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY SIR FOURTEEN THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIANS. BUT WHAT I THINK OF THE PRIVATE- BASICALLY DO HAVE BUT- OPPORTUNITY AND ABILITY TO IT- TO EXPAND- ACT. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS FOR OUR FOR US AS WE LOOK IN TERMS OF SINCE WE'VE A MOST OF US I CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS- FAIRLY QUICKLY A REAL CHALLENGE IS ACTUALLY A COMMUNICATING THAT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HI AND OF THE EXAMPLES I CAN GET IF YOU WE HAVE THESE MEETINGS WITH CHAPLAINS AND PRESIDENT CENTRAL POINT ROUTE THE REASON WHY WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IN A MIXED. AND ALL WELL I. TO THIS. BECAUSE OF THAT AFTER WOULD COST THE FOR TO THESE CA COLLEGES IN THE STAFF TO ACTUALLY GIVE WHAT WOULD AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO START AT THE SAME MOMENT X. EXPRESS BUT AS WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER GRANTS WE EXPECT. A QUITE YET GET THAT BUT WHAT WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING AS A STATE I KNOW THAT ANYBODY CAN APPLY FOR CAL GRANT AND THAT THEY CAN TAKE THAT WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WHEN YOU SEE A CSU OR OF YOU APPEAR IN SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE I GET THAT SO ANYTHING ELSE THAT. FROM QUE. DAHLE FROM YOUR- WELL I. IF YOU GET A CLEARLY THAT THE ARE AN OPTION- AND A PART OF THE STRATEGY TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOSTER OUR STUDENTS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY- AS THE COMMUNITY AT THE AT THE STATE LEGISLATING A- MARKET AND COMMUNICATE THAT TO OUR STUDENTS AND TO. A THE COMMERCE IN WE ALL I'M KIND OF THE WHOLE HOLD MY HAND UP IS HOLED UP REMEMBER THE PRIVATES REMEMBER THE PRIVATE. AND SO OUR STUDENTS AREN'T GETTING THE MESSAGE UNLESS WE ACTUALLY GET OUT AND SO ON OUTSIDE THE PROVINCE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THAT I THINK ON THE PUBLIC SIDE. OF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ALSO SOUGHT I THINK IS A IT WOULD COME AT LEAST AB TEASE BANDEAU. WHY CAN WE ARE TO THE MA MORE. TEARS UP THE OBVIOUS I. TO THIS OKAY THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST I THINK YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLE OF FRESNO PACIFIC'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS THE PARTNERSHIP THE REP. EARLIER BETWEEN UC BERKELEY. AND MILLS CALL PAGE. BOTH OF THOSE EFFORTS WERE REALLY. I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST BORN OUT OF- JUST A PARTNERSHIP ENTER. LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL LEADERS BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THOSE DO YOU PROVIDE A GLIMPSE OF OUR PROP PRACTICES THAT COULD BE REPLICATED IN OTHER. REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT I NEED AREAS LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND WILL CERTAINLY- IS PRIVATE. INSTITUTIONS YOU CAN'T. RISK WRECKED EIGHT. ARE FROM YOU KNOW FOR SCALING THE UP THERE ARE MY IS MY UNDERSTANDING LEASE THERE ARE WAYS THROUGH OPR AND OTHERS TO PER MAKE SOME FUNDS AVAILABLE ON A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS WHEREBY OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. TO REPLICATE SUMMIT PROMISED PRACTICES MMHM. OKAY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THAT CONCLUDES THE- FIVE PANELS ARE FOUR PANELS PLUS OUR- OUR OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER FROM THAT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA COLLEGE FEATURES FOUNDATION SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO PARTICIPATE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT PLEASE.
