00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.406
SOMETHING THAT IS AT THE

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.974

AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. GOING

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.351
FORWARD IS THAT IS THAT THERE'S

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.574
MINISTER. TO CREATE DISASTER

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:26.609
PLANS DECREASED DISASTER

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.845
MANUALS TO BE READY FOR JUST

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:30.846
ABOUT ANYTHING BECAUSE WHO KNEW

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:33.249
ABOUT A PANDEMIC. M. AND BEING

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.517

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:37.620
THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT- I'M SO

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:38.154
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.489
GRANTS AND MONEYS- I WAS IN

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.391
CHARGE OF ENSURING THAT. THE

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.727
CITY OF LOS ANGELES NOW ONLY

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.028
GOT MONEY BACK FROM THE FEDERAL

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.930
GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FOR STATE

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.799
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY FILLED OUT.

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:51.300
THESE FORMS FOR STATE GRANTS

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.569
ACTUALLY FILLED OUT- FORMS TO

GET. IT FROM THE FEDERAL

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.573
GOVERNMENT AND I THINK I DID A

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.574
PRETTY GOOD JOB WE NEVER HAD TO

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.510
BORROW MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:03.646
DEAL WITH THIS NOW IT SEEMS.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.481
LIKE A LOT OF MUNICIPALITIES.

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:06.749
EITHER NOT GETTING THEIR

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.050
MONEY'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:08.584
TRAINED WITHIN THE

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.219
INFRASTRUCTURE OR THERE'S A

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:13.856
DELAY. OR THEY JUST MISS. BEING

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.125
ABLE TO APPLY FOR IT ALTOGETHER

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.092
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:19.395
THERE. THAT KNOW HOW TO GET

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.998
MONEY BACK FROM FEMA. AND SO I.

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:24.533
THE STATE USED TO BE PRETTY

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.069
GOOD AT ENSURING THAT WE HAD

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.338
PEOPLE IN EVERY MUNICIPALITY

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:29.939
THAT WAS TRAINED TO DO THAT I

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.540
THINK WE EVEN. THERE WAS EVEN A

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.543
LAW THAT MADE IT A REQUIREMENT

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:35.077
THAT WE HAD AT THIS

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.879
INFRASTRUCTURE AND- AND SO I'M

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:37.980
JUST KIND OF CURIOUS BECAUSE

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:39.782
I'M I'M I GET THE FEELING THAT

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.917
MAY BE BUDGET CUTS. THAT THAT'S

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.319
BEEN DECIMATED AND WE DON'T

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.554

HAS BEEN MAKING TO THE PROGRAM

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.945
OVER THE PAST YEAR IN RESPONSE

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:52.446
TO A DIRECTIVE FROM THE

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.648
GOVERNOR. I IN THE INTEREST OF

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:57.517
TIME I WON'T DETAIL THEM BUT- I

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.553
WILL NOTE THAT GENERALLY WE

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.321
THINK THEY SEEM LIKE A STEP IN

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:03.256
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT-

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:05.659
PROBABLY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH- I

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:08.161
KNOW EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:10.497
MORE. INTERESTING COMMENTS BUT

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:12.532
PRIMARILY- WHAT'S LACKING FROM

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:14.768
THE EXISTING PROGRAM AND THE

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.737
GOVERNOR'S. MEDICAL CARE

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:18.505

ON PAGE FOR THE HAND OUT- WHICH

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:25.746
IS WHERE WE INCLUDE OUR

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:27.781
ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM-

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:31.184
pVERY SIMPLE- WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:32.519
ANY PROGRAM WE ASK TWO

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:33.887
QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:35.188
THE PROGRAM AND USING MEETING

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:37.657
THOSE GOALS. AND IN THIS CASE

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.760
WE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:42.095
STATUTORY MISSION OR GOALS FOR

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.163
THIS PROGRAM WHICH MAKES IT

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.165
VERY. DIFFICULT TO ASSESS IF

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:48.602
IT'S- SOMETHING IMPORTANT STATE

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:49.269
FUNCTION AND TO CONTINUE TO

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:51.605
EXIST- IF IT'S APPROPRIATELY

01:46:51.671 --> 01:46:56.510
STRUCTURED AND RESOURCED. I OR

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:57.144
IF IT'S OPERATING EFFECTIVELY-

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:59.112
IT ALSO GIVES FINISH DISCRETION

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.447
TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:01.948
SEC AND HOW TO OPERATE THE

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:03.049
PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY SAID AS I

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:05.318
SAID EARLIER. I THANK YOU JUST

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:07.487
REALLY REQUIRES THE SEC TO

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:09.756
PERFORM REMAINING ACTIVITIES-

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:11.758
BUT DOES NOT TELL ME IF YOU SEE

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:13.593
HOW TO PERFORM THOSE ACTIVITIES

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.729
SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU SEE HAVE

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:17.531
TO ISSUE CERTAIN REPORTS. BY

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:19.366
EIGHT COULD CHOOSE AND WHETHER

01:47:19.432 --> 01:47:21.802
TO. WRITE THEM IN A MANNER THAT

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:25.238
IS- YOU KNOW. INTENDED FOR

01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:26.640
FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS IF THE

01:47:26.706 --> 01:47:28.542
GOAL IS REALLY TO BE AN ASSET

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:30.277
TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO.

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:32.245
COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO OPERATE

01:47:32.312 --> 01:47:34.381
THESE FACILITIES OR IF I COULD

01:47:34.447 --> 01:47:35.649
WRITE IT IN A MANNER THAT'S

01:47:35.715 --> 01:47:38.552
VERY- ACCESSIBLE TO THE LAKE

01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:39.653
THE LAYPERSON IF THE GOAL IS

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:44.424
TO. PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. TO

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.793
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- SO

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.995
MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE AND THE

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.263
REST OF MY HAND OUT AND

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:51.097
COMMENTS PERTAIN TO OUR

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:52.499
RECOMMENDATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.668
FACT FINDING- AND JUST HAD A

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:56.069
VERY HIGH LEVEL WE'VE THREE

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:59.072
RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS TO

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:01.074
SET A CLEAR MISSION AND GOALS

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.843
FOR THE PROGRAM IN STATUTE THE

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:05.011
SECOND IS TO ALIGN BOARD

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:06.646
MEMBERSHIP WITH THAT MISSION

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.281
AND GOALS AND THE THIRD IS TO

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:09.783
REQUIRED THE SEC TO SUBMIT A

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.852
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:14.087
HOW IT WILL ALIGN THE PROGRAM

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:16.156
WITH THAT MISSION GOALS. GOING

01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:18.291
INTO THOSE EACH- IN A LITTLE

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:20.594
BIT MORE DETAIL FIRST WE HAVE

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.661
AN ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:23.196
COMMISSION AND GOALS NOW OF

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:24.364
COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:25.999
ESTABLISH ANY GOALS THAT IT IT

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.601
SEEMS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:28.368
THE PROGRAM BUT WE DO

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:31.671
RECOMMEND- A SPECIFIC MISSION-

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:33.673
WHICH IS TO PROMOTE LEGAL

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.775
HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS-

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:37.177
WHICH WE WOULD KNOW DOES NOT

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.478
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.479
DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:41.147
INFORMAL- MISSION OF THE

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:42.916
PROGRAM ALTHOUGH WE DO THINK

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:44.718
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT BE-

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:46.253
CODIFIED GIVEN NOT A FUTURE

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:47.320
ADMINISTRATION COULD ADOPT A

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:48.889
DIFFERENT INFORMAL AND-

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:51.358
MISSION. AND THEN WE RECOMMEND

01:48:51.424 --> 01:48:53.193
FOR SPECIFIC GOALS TO FURTHER

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.328
THAT OVER ARCHING MISSION AND

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:57.197
THOSE ARE ONE TO MAINTAIN

01:48:57.264 --> 01:48:58.598
STANDARDS THAT HELP LOCAL

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:00.200
LEADERS DETERMINE AND MEET

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:02.068
MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.371
DETENTION FACILITY CONDITIONS

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:06.239
TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:08.208
ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH-

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:12.545
STANDARDS. AND INSPECTIONS OF

01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:13.780

FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:24.557
IN LOCAL DETENTION FACILITY

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:28.261
CONDITIONS. AND OUR SECOND GOAL

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:30.196
THEY MENTIONED IS TO AFTER

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:32.732
ESTABLISHING- IN STATUTE.

01:49:32.799 --> 01:49:35.735
ARCHITECT CONTAGION IF YOU IT'S

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.404
AFTER STUMBLING CONDITIONING IN

MEMBERSHIP WITH THEM. AND WE

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:46.413
pRECOMMENDATIONS ARE SOME

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:50.550
RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THAT.

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:52.452
UMBRELLA- THE FIRST IS TO ADD

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:54.454

ADVOCACY SURROUNDING DETENTION

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:03.663
CONDITIONS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE-

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:06.132
THE B. THE BOARD CURRENTLY HAS

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.001
SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN- SLOTS

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:09.536
ARE DESIGNATED FOR LEADERS AND

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:12.372
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR-

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:15.208
BY MANAGE FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.810
INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM SO

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:17.310
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.980
EXPERTISE ON. OPERATIONS BUT

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.448
THERE IS NO DESIGNATED SPOT

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:23.683
FIRST- A PERSON WITH EXPERTISE

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:26.052
IN OVERSIGHT AND GIVEN THIS IS

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:28.722
ONE OF THE SEC'S FOR- CORP

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:30.123
PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.858
IMPORTANT I'M IN THE SECOND

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:34.494
RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO-

01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:35.695
BALANCE THAT APPOINTMENT

01:50:35.762 --> 01:50:36.696
AUTHORITIES BETWEEN THE

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:38.098
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.699
CURRENTLY THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:41.301
TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS AND

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:43.069
THE LEGISLATURE. APPOINTS TO SO

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:44.371
WE THINK HAVE A BETTER BALANCE

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:48.541
THEIR WAY TO HELP FACILITATE.

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.744
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.078
MOVING ON TO THE PAGE SEVEN- WE

TRYING TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:55.147
OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ON NON

COMPLIANCE ISSUES AGAIN THE

02:10:57.082 --> 02:10:59.218
GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF KERN

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:01.520
COUNTY- THE FILM SPECTER

THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION

ABOUT THAT TO THE BOOK THERE

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:10.062

COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND THERE

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.804
NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED INSPECTIONS

02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:22.274
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NO THE

02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:22.841
ISSUE OF KERN COUNTY IS ALSO

02:11:22.908 --> 02:11:24.343
CRITICAL. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:26.078
WHAT THE FEDERAL INSPECTORS SAW

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:27.946
THE KERN COUNTY HAS ONE THE

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:29.648
HIGHEST RATES OF SUICIDES IN

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:31.116
INDIA ARE COUNTY JAIL IN

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:33.452
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT

02:11:33.518 --> 02:11:34.620
SOMETHING TO BE A FIFTY HAS

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:35.654
EVER DISCUSSED I THINK THEY

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:36.622
NEVER BRING IT UP AT THE BOARD

02:11:36.688 --> 02:11:39.725
MEETINGS- IT'S NOT A FOCUS AREA

02:11:39.791 --> 02:11:42.594
AND SO CLEARLY- THE BOARD IS

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:43.929
NOT GETTING THE TYPING

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:46.298
INFORMATION THAT IT NEEDS- TO

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:47.766
SERVICE LEADERSHIP BODY. SO

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:48.734
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:49.601
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WOULD

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:55.173
MAKE FOR HER- BCC. I MADE TO

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.209

AL FROM L. A. O. IS A- TO

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:05.517
BALANCE THE BOARD. WHICH AT

02:12:05.584 --> 02:12:06.685
THIS POINT IS STILL AS WE VERY

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:09.721
LONG DA SOUL I MANY THAT THERE

02:12:09.788 --> 02:12:11.623
SHOULD BE A INCLUSION OF X.

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.158
OTHER EXPERTISE IS SUCH AS

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:15.227
MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:18.063
ABUSE- FACILITY CONDITIONS AND

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:19.598
ALSO I THINK OF UTMOST

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.762
THAT TIME MADE TO THOSE LOCAL

02:20:37.829 --> 02:20:41.933
AGENCIES TO NOT INTERFERE. N.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.302
F. AS I GO THROUGH THIS I GUESS

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:47.071
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. BSE C.

02:20:47.138 --> 02:20:49.741
WAS REALLY SET UP MORE. AS YOU

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:51.609
LOOK AT IT LESS ABOUT OVERSIGHT

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:52.811
AND MORE ABOUT BEING AN

02:20:52.877 --> 02:20:55.847
ADVISORY BODY PER SE TO THE

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:57.282
LOCAL AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT

02:20:57.348 --> 02:20:59.617
IS WHY WE DO NEED TO TAKE A

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:03.588
LOOK AT. THE ROLE OF WHAT WE

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:05.523
EXPECT NOW B. O. C. C. TO DO

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:08.960
AND SET STANDARDS WERE THE

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:09.861
STATE'S RELIED A LOT OF

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:12.063
FUNCTIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:15.033
OR MORE. INCLUDING TO THE IN

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:20.338
THE. THE JAILS IN RELATION

02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:20.872
BETWEEN THE JAILS AND THE

02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:22.340
PRISONS BUT WE'VE DONE IT IN

02:21:22.407 --> 02:21:23.775
OTHER HUMAN SERVICES WE'VE DONE

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.910
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:29.113
AND THE ONE THING THAT I'M

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:30.849
CONSTANTLY CONCERNEDABOUT AND

02:21:30.915 --> 02:21:31.950
WE'RE SEEING THIS I THINK IN

02:21:32.016 --> 02:21:34.252
THIS CASE IS IF THE STATE'S NOT

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:37.055
VERY CLEAR ABOUT SETTING OUT

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.656
STANDARDS AND HAVE WAYS TO

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.325
ENFORCE THOSE STANDARDS IT IS

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:41.559
TRUE THAT IT'S UP TO LOCAL

02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:42.994
JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT AND

02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:44.262
THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT IN

02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:45.663
THEIR WAY. BUT IF WE'RE NOT

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.665
SENDING SOME BASELINE STANDARDS

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:49.167
AND BEING VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE

02:21:49.234 --> 02:21:51.269
FORTIES THEN WE'RE GOING TO END

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:53.838
UP WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:55.440
WHERE IMPLEMENTATION IS VERY

02:21:55.506 --> 02:21:57.675
DIFFERENT COUNTY BY COUNTY. AND

02:21:57.742 --> 02:21:58.810
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:01.379
CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO SEE. SO

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:03.248
IT IS. CLEAR THAT IT'S TIME

02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:04.849
THAT WE REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT.

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:09.053
THE MAKE UP. OPSEC END IF END.

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.922
REALLY BOLSTER THEIR ABILITY TO

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:11.589
DO THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:14.559
EXPECT. AND THAT MEANS AND THAT

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:16.494
IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE IS

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:17.629
PRIMARILY CHARGED WITH IS

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:19.998
OVERSIGHT OF THE ACTIVITIES HE

02:22:20.064 --> 02:22:20.999
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES BOTH

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.533
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:25.069
JUDICIARY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

02:22:25.136 --> 02:22:26.671
SURE THAT AN ORGANIZATION LIKE

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:28.439
BE IT C. C. HAS THE APPROPRIATE

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:30.174
TOOLS HAS THE APPROPRIATE

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:32.043
MEMBERSHIP HAS THE APPROPRIATE

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:34.312
AUTHORITIES. MISSION STATEMENTS

02:22:34.379 --> 02:22:36.848
AND ALSO ARE THE OUTLIERS WERE.

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:39.017
REPORT HERE IS I THINK VERY

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:41.619
INSTRUCTIVE AT PROVIDING US

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:43.821
WITH A BIT OF A PATH FORWARD.

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:45.223
AND COMING UP WITH STRONGER

02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:46.224
STATEMENTS AND THAT IS OUR

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:47.992
RESPONSIBILITY MATCH THAT IS

02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:49.460
THE JOB OF THE LEGISLATURE.

02:22:49.527 --> 02:22:52.263
ANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FCC IS

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:53.865
SET UP. TO PROVIDE THAT

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:55.967
OVERSIGHT BUT ALSO ABOUT THE

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:57.902
LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS

02:22:57.969 --> 02:23:00.571
OVERSIGHT. OF THOSE FUNCTIONS

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:03.675
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION SO I

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:06.277
THE IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE SEC

02:23:06.344 --> 02:23:08.379
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME VERY

02:23:08.446 --> 02:23:09.180
SERIOUS COMPLAINTS AND SOME

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:12.550
CONCERNS. BUT HAS BEEN TRYING

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:14.686
TO MEASURE UP TO HOW THE DAY

02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:15.687
WERE STRUCTURED IN THE

02:23:15.753 --> 02:23:16.454
AUTHORITIES THAT THEY WERE

02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:20.091
GIVEN. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS

02:23:20.158 --> 02:23:21.859
IT WAS REALLY A FAILURE OF. THE

02:23:21.926 --> 02:23:24.862
INITIAL ENABLING STATUTES TO

02:23:24.929 --> 02:23:27.198
CREATE AN APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE.

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:29.600
AND ALLOW FOR THE OVERSIGHT

02:23:29.667 --> 02:23:32.103
INPUT AND TRANSPARENCY AND

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:34.038
REALLY THAT'S ON US AND THAT IS

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:35.807
ACTUALLY ONE REASON THAT IT'S

02:23:35.873 --> 02:23:37.542
INTERESTING AND BUT I THINK

02:23:37.608 --> 02:23:38.776
VERY WISE OF THE SPEAKER TO PUT

02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:40.712
THE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:44.148
COMMITTEE ON THIS SUB COMMITTEE

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:45.850
BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTERSECTION

02:23:45.917 --> 02:23:49.854
OF POLICY. AND BUDGET THAT IS

02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:51.189
REALLY ULTIMATELY VERY

02:23:51.255 --> 02:23:53.091
IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE DO

02:23:53.157 --> 02:23:55.059
OVERSIGHT WHICH WE DO THROUGH

02:23:55.126 --> 02:23:56.694
THE BUDGET PROCESS. WE'RE ALSO.

02:23:56.761 --> 02:23:57.595
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:23:57.662 --> 02:24:00.098
LOOK AT THIS STRUCTURES THAT WE

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:01.599
HAVE PUT IN PLACE OR HAVE BEEN

02:24:01.666 --> 02:24:03.301
PUT IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS

02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:05.470
THAT LEGISLATION PUT IN PLACE.

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:07.205
TO ACCOMPLISH VARIOUS THINGS

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:09.574
THAT I AM JUST NOT SURE BCC IS

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:11.743
ACCOMPLISHING WHAT WE NEED THEM

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:12.744
TO BE ACCOMPLISHING AT THIS

02:24:12.810 --> 02:24:14.979
POINT IN TIME. AND TAKE A LOOK

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:16.681
AT THE OVERSIGHT THE STATE

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:17.548
PROVIDES TO THESE LOCAL

02:24:17.615 --> 02:24:20.018
AGENCIES. TO DO THE BEST JOB

02:24:20.084 --> 02:24:22.687
POSSIBLE AND- ALL OF THE TALK

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:24.489
HERE BOTH IN THE L. A. REPORT

02:24:24.555 --> 02:24:26.391
IN FROM MEMBERS OF BCC RIGHT

02:24:26.457 --> 02:24:28.359
NOW ABOUT BEST PRACTICES. AND

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:29.494
PROVIDING SORT OF THAT

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.865
OVERSIGHT AND- N. REQUIRING

02:24:33.931 --> 02:24:35.833
LOCAL AGENCIES TO MEET MINIMUM

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.602
STANDARDS WE CAN HELP SET THOSE

02:24:37.668 --> 02:24:38.803
MINIMUM STANDARDS AND THINK

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:39.737
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:41.072
SHOULD DO THEN I THINK WE WOULD

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:44.042
HAVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR

02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:45.710
PEOPLE WHO ARE CURSED RATED AT

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:46.944
THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WAS THE

02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:48.880
POINT WOULD BE A CC WAS THE

02:24:48.946 --> 02:24:50.915
POINT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:52.817
LOOK AT AS WE TRY TO CLEAN UP

02:24:52.884 --> 02:24:55.286
THE STATE LEVEL. SYSTEMS THAT

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:58.589
IT THAT ECKHART'S THREE PEOPLE

02:24:58.656 --> 02:25:01.526
IT IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY

02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:03.561
TO REQUIRE CERTAIN MINIMUM.

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:05.797
CAPACITY CAPABILITY AT

02:25:05.863 --> 02:25:08.499
EXPECTATIONS EVEN AT THE LOCAL

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:10.902
LEVEL SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT I

02:25:10.968 --> 02:25:12.303
THINK OUR TASK IS HERE IT'S

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.072
PRETTY CLEAR I DON'T KNOW IT'S

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:15.306
GONNA TAKE SOME HARD WORK

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.674
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:18.309
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AND THE AND

02:25:18.376 --> 02:25:20.244
THE ADVOCATES IN THIS CASE. TO

02:25:20.311 --> 02:25:21.145
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:23.081
UP THE CORRECT SYSTEM BUT IT

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:24.115
JUST SEEMS TO ME IN THIS

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:26.184
CONVERSATION THAT THERE'S NOT

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:28.019
AT THIS POINT A DISAGREEMENT

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:30.555
THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE AND

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:32.390
THAT THERE IS A PATH AHEAD OF

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:34.292
US OF COURSE THE DETAILS AS

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:36.327
ALWAYS WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE

02:25:36.394 --> 02:25:38.362
THE EASIEST BUT THAT'S THAT'S

02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:40.064
THE ROLE THAT WE HAVE HERE. TO

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:41.065
APPRECIATE MADAM CHAIR THE

02:25:41.132 --> 02:25:42.867

THIS ITEM FORWARD. AND IT'S

02:25:44.836 --> 02:25:47.004
JUST VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:48.739
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE

02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:51.409
IMPLEMENTED OF THIS REALIGNMENT

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:52.810
AND LOOK FOR PLACES LIKE THIS

02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:54.112
WHERE THERE ARE CLEAR NEEDS FOR

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:56.380
STATE STANDARDS AND IMPLEMENT

02:25:56.447 --> 02:26:00.218

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.388
EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT IF SO HE'S

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:19.523
QUITE FRANKLY AND WE AS A STATE

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:21.659
SHOULD PUSH TO CONTINUE PUSH

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:22.727
FOR CIVILIANS AND PROGRAMS

02:28:22.793 --> 02:28:24.795
REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR

02:28:24.862 --> 02:28:27.131
ENCOURAGING REHABILITATION AND

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.233
SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION IT HAS

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:30.101

INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL BE

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:33.704
TOMORROW'S NEIGHBOR WE SHOULD

02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:35.139
CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR NEIGHBORS

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:37.441
TO RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATIONAL

02:28:37.508 --> 02:28:38.609
VOCATIONAL AND OTHER SUPPORT

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:41.512
THAT. THEY NEED TO THRIVE I

02:28:41.579 --> 02:28:42.580
WOULD PARTICIPATE IN STATE

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:44.315
COURT IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:46.384
USING OUR FUNDING SOURCES TO

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:48.552
INCENTIVIZE REHABILITATION LAW

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:50.087
ENFORCEMENT CANNOT CONTINUE

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:52.857
WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL THEY

02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:54.859
MUST EMBRACE A PERSON FOCUSED

02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:56.761
REHABILITATION APPROACH RATHER

02:28:56.827 --> 02:28:58.195
THAN CONTINUING TO LOCK HIM UP

02:28:58.262 --> 02:29:00.765
AND THROW AWAY THE KEY TACTICS

02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.701
OF THE PAST. SO BE SEC. HAS BY

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:06.504
THEIR OWN ADMISSION SAID THAT

02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:09.607
THEY ARE HAMSTRUNG. BY THE

02:29:09.674 --> 02:29:11.175
LEGISLATURE AND WHAT WE PUT IN

02:29:11.242 --> 02:29:14.045
PLACE. AND SO WE AS A

02:29:14.111 --> 02:29:15.880
LEGISLATURE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:18.316
VIABLE MEANS TO NOT ONLY CHANGE

02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:22.019
THE COMPOSITION OF THE B. SEC

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:24.855
WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT SERVES TO

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:27.725
PROTECT THE STATUS QUO. BUT WE

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:31.062
NEED TO MAKE IT NâNG BALANCED.

02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:32.430
BUT ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHERE

02:29:32.496 --> 02:29:34.265
WE'RE MOVING AT THE STATE WHERE

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:37.101
WHERE WHERE THE PUBLIC WANTS US

02:29:37.168 --> 02:29:40.071
TO MOVE- THAT INCLUDES EVEN

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:41.439
LOOKING AT SHARES AND SHARES

02:29:41.505 --> 02:29:44.008
TRAINING. THAT WE PUT YOUNG

02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:45.643
CADETS IN THE SHERIFF'S

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:48.979
DEPARTMENT IN. IN JAILS TO

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.948
WHERE THEY BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO

02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:53.250
KIND OF A VIOLENT. WAY OF

02:29:53.317 --> 02:29:55.152
INTERACTING WITH THEIR

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:57.355
CONSTITUENTS. AVACEN OFFICE AND

02:29:57.421 --> 02:29:58.989
LAW ENFORCEMENT I SHOULD BE

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:00.725
INCENTIVIZED TO ADULT

02:30:00.791 --> 02:30:03.527
REHABILITATION FOCUSED. OR

02:30:03.594 --> 02:30:05.496
POSSIBLY LOSE THE MONEY THAT WE

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:06.997
GIVE THEM AND WE NEED TO

02:30:07.064 --> 02:30:08.766
RETRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE

02:30:08.833 --> 02:30:10.735
MOVE DJJ KIDS THE COUNTY

02:30:10.801 --> 02:30:13.471
DETENTION. ALL OF THIS CAN'T

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:17.274
HAPPEN. IF WE CONTINUE TO DO

02:30:17.341 --> 02:30:18.542
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:19.844
AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT

02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:22.546
RESULT AND SO I WILL WORK WITH

02:30:22.613 --> 02:30:25.182
MY COLLEAGUES TO ON BOTH SIDES

02:30:25.249 --> 02:30:27.251
OF THE AISLE. BOTH THE

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:30.421
ADVOCATES. AND PEOPLE IN LAW

02:30:30.488 --> 02:30:33.624
ENFORCEMENT THAT WE START FROM

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:37.495
SCRATCH. WITH THIS ORGANIZATION

02:30:37.561 --> 02:30:39.363
CALLED THE B. S. C. C. AND WE

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:40.498
HAVE A HONEST DISCUSSION WITH

02:30:40.564 --> 02:30:42.733
OURSELVES WHAT DO WE WANT THIS

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.869
ORGANIZATION TO DO BECAUSE

02:30:44.935 --> 02:30:47.204
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT DOING WHAT-

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:50.808
WE WANT THEM TO DO RIGHT NOW IN

02:30:50.875 --> 02:30:51.709
TWENTY TWENTY IT MAY MADE SENSE

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:54.812
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:55.312
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:57.448
SEVENTY BUT- IT IS NOT WORKING.

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:59.116
AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO WE

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:00.384
REALLY DO HAVE TO HAVE THAT

02:31:00.451 --> 02:31:01.752
HONEST DISCUSSION I ALSO THINK

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:04.255
WE NEED TO MOVE FAIRLY QUICKLY-

02:31:04.321 --> 02:31:07.057

THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

02:31:16.567 --> 02:31:18.903
DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO

02:31:18.969 --> 02:31:21.005
IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT- WE

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:24.575
WILL CORRECT PROBLEM IN THE

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:26.977

CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK WE

02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:37.555

MOVE. THE BOTTOM ARRAY OF.

02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:43.561

ON LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES.

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:04.815
ARE THERE ANY OTHER OVERSIGHT

02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:07.518

THAT THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL-

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:37.114
REMEDIES. WHEN THAT IN FACT

02:32:37.181 --> 02:32:40.017

AND DO THEIR PORTION OF AN

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:55.666
INSPECTION. AND I THINK- WHEN

02:32:55.733 --> 02:32:56.800
THOSE THINGS ARE FOUND OUT OF

02:32:56.867 --> 02:32:57.868
COMPLIANCE WE HAVE SEEN A

02:32:57.935 --> 02:33:01.171
NUMBER OF- CIVIL SUITS

02:33:01.238 --> 02:33:02.573
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT IS A

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:06.210
COMPLICATED EQUATION IN THAT-

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:09.346
THERE ARE. ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:33:09.413 --> 02:33:11.081
RUNNING FACILITIES THERE ARE

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:12.716
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT HAVE

02:33:12.783 --> 02:33:15.386
OVERSIGHT OF THE BUDGETS FOR

OFFICERS ACROSS THE STATE AND-

02:33:21.692 --> 02:33:24.428
THE OPERATION OF THESE.

02:33:24.495 --> 02:33:27.531
ENTITIES IS FIFTY EIGHT

02:33:27.598 --> 02:33:31.335
DIFFERENT ARE. SHAPES SIZES

02:33:31.402 --> 02:33:37.074
AND- IT IS A DAUNTING TASK TO

02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:38.409
SAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF

02:33:38.475 --> 02:33:39.710
THEM THINK THAT THEY ARE ON

02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:42.913
EQUAL FOOTING THE RESOURCING

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:45.115
AND WHAT GOES ON OUT THERE

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:47.818
MAKES IT DIFFICULT WITH THAT

02:33:47.885 --> 02:33:49.954
SAID OUR INSPECTIONS ARE

02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:52.489
CERTAINLY GOING IN AND TAKING A

02:33:52.556 --> 02:33:53.991
HARD LOOK AT WHAT WE ACTUALLY

02:33:54.058 --> 02:33:56.093
SEE INSIDE OF THE FACILITY BUT

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.562
THEY ARE BACKED UP BY LOOKING

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:01.565
AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:04.535
LOOKING AT- OF BACK UP

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:07.137
INFORMATION- TO ENSURE THEIR-

02:34:07.204 --> 02:34:08.539
DOCUMENTATION SAYING THAT THEY

02:34:08.606 --> 02:34:10.574
ARE. DOING WHAT THEY'RE SAY

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:13.711
THEY ARE DOING IN A FACILITY-

02:34:13.777 --> 02:34:16.814
CERTAINLY YOU'RE- THE

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:18.182
LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO HAVE

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:20.985
GREATER AUTHORITY- AS I SAID

02:34:21.051 --> 02:34:23.287
EARLIER WE ARE WILLING TO DO

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:25.356
WHATEVER JOB WE ARE TASKED WITH

02:34:25.422 --> 02:34:31.362
DOING. OKAY- LET ME JUST SAY

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:34.632
THIS FIRST OF ALL- THE

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:35.232
POPULATION THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:34:35.299 --> 02:34:39.637
ABOUT. PROVIDING INSTRUCTION A

02:34:39.703 --> 02:34:41.772
CARE FOR IS A COMPLEX.

02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:43.307
COPULATION IMPRESSED TO

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:45.042
CHARACTERIZE IT ONE WAY OR THE

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:48.212
OTHER I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC.

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:51.281
AND FIRST OF ALL WHEN AND THE

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:53.217
WHOLE SPIRIT OF REALIGNMENT.

02:34:53.283 --> 02:34:54.918
BEING COMMENDABLE THERE ARE

02:34:54.985 --> 02:34:56.487
SOME INHERENT PROBLEMS FROM THE

02:34:56.553 --> 02:34:57.921
GET GO THERE WERE NEVER

02:34:57.988 --> 02:35:01.525
ADMITTED TO. FIRST OF ALL GELS

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:02.960
WERE NEVER DESIGNED FOR LONG

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:04.061
TERM INCARCERATION. HUGE

02:35:04.128 --> 02:35:08.499
PROBLEM HUGE PROBLEM AND THERE

02:35:08.565 --> 02:35:12.036
ARE JUST SOME. SOME INHERENT

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:14.672
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I THINK. RBS

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:16.807
CC'S PROBLEMS THERE ARE

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.909
PROBLEMS AS LEGISLATORS AS

02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:21.712
OVERSEERS AS POLICY CREATORS

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:23.847
WHERE THE WHERE THE ONES OF.

02:35:23.914 --> 02:35:26.216
PUT HIM IN THIS THE-

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:28.385
UNSUCCESSFUL SITUATION KNOWN

02:35:28.452 --> 02:35:31.488
FORSMAN AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT.

02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:33.924
RESPONSIBILITY AS CONFLICT. I

02:35:33.991 --> 02:35:38.929
MEAN AND THEN WE TRY TO BLAME-

02:35:38.996 --> 02:35:42.132
THE OVERSIGHT. GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:45.369
FOR THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT-

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:45.936
THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING WE

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:48.472
NEED TO. THE EVALUATE AND I

02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:51.241
THINK. WE JUST HAVE TO BE

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:53.544
CAREFUL I THINK BALLOTS ALWAYS

02:35:53.610 --> 02:35:55.579
NEEDS TO BE THE GOAL. AND I

02:35:55.646 --> 02:36:00.818
WILL I HOPE THAT- BALANCE IS

02:36:00.884 --> 02:36:01.585
NOT ONLY A CONCERN WE'RE

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:04.254
TALKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

02:36:04.321 --> 02:36:06.623
ASPECT IN PUBLIC POLICY THAT

02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:07.491
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:11.595
ELSEWHERE BUT THIS IS CLEARLY A

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:12.730
POPULATION THAT WE ALL BENEFIT

02:36:12.796 --> 02:36:15.666
FROM IF WITH THAT ARRIVE IN OUR

02:36:15.733 --> 02:36:19.002
GOAL OF REHABILITATION HOWEVER.

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:22.706
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE- IN A

02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:24.508
SITUATION THAT THOSE WHO ARE

02:36:24.575 --> 02:36:24.975
CARRIED OUT WITH THE

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:27.878
OVERSTEPPING ARE ALSO PROTECTED

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.580
AND SO THAT THOSE ARE THE

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:30.280
BALANCES THAT NEED TO BE

02:36:30.347 --> 02:36:32.816
CONSIDERED AND I LOOK FORWARD

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:35.052
TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM TO

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:37.254
ADDRESS THESE. CHALLENGES IN A

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:39.189
MEANINGFUL WAY BUT THERE'S SOME

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:41.391
POLICY ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEED TO

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:43.660
BE MADE IMMEDIATELY. AND I AND

INSPECTION PROCESS ARE THERE

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.656
SPECIFIC METHODS OF ENFORCEMENT

IN YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU

02:38:20.557 --> 02:38:21.158
THINK WOULD BE THE MOST

02:38:21.225 --> 02:38:23.861
EFFECTIVE IF WE ARE BEGINNING A

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:24.561
DISCUSSION OF HOW WE DO THIS

02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:26.630
BETTER. ON HOW WE MOVE FORWARD

02:38:26.697 --> 02:38:27.831
WITH THEIR GOALS AND HOW WE

02:38:27.898 --> 02:38:29.900
LEARN FROM FROM THE MOMENT WHEN

02:38:29.967 --> 02:38:31.935
ARE THERE SPECIFIC- ENFORCEMENT

02:38:32.002 --> 02:38:33.403
MEANT THAT THAT YOU THINK.

02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:35.606
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING

02:38:35.672 --> 02:38:38.208
COMPLIANCE. AS WEAK AS WE

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:38.742
CONSIDER THE WORK AHEAD OF

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:42.145
REFORM. I I WANT TO GET THE

02:38:42.212 --> 02:38:44.114
MOST DIRECT ANSWER THAT I CAN

02:38:44.181 --> 02:38:45.415
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THIS

02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:49.019
OPENS UP REALLY HUGE POLICY

02:38:49.086 --> 02:38:50.988
TANGLE IF YOU WELL WHEN IT

02:38:51.054 --> 02:38:53.357
COMES TO THE STATE OF THE

02:38:53.423 --> 02:38:55.058
LIMITS ON THE STATE'S AUTHORITY

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:57.060
TO DIRECT. HOW THE COUNTIES DO

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.596
THINGS SO- I WOULD JUST NOTE

02:38:59.663 --> 02:39:01.164
THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE IN THIS

02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:05.969
WHOLE DISCUSSION AREA- AND YOU

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:08.171
KNOW I THINK. AGAIN THOSE ARE

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:09.539
THE THOSE ISSUES COME UP FAST

02:39:09.606 --> 02:39:11.642
ACROSS SO MANY DIFFERENT POLICY

02:39:11.708 --> 02:39:12.843
ISSUE AREAS THE STATE AND

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:17.147
LOCAL- DIFFERENCES AND- THAT'S

02:39:17.214 --> 02:39:18.782
WHY I WAS SO INTERESTED TO HEAR

02:39:18.849 --> 02:39:20.550
THE RECENT DISCUSSIONS. OUT OF

02:39:20.617 --> 02:39:22.352
THE- ALLY G. IN THE VARIOUS

02:39:22.419 --> 02:39:24.154
BUDGET HEARINGS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:39:24.221 --> 02:39:26.056
AN ENTITY THAT DOES HAVE THE

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:27.791
ABILITY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.126
ENFORCEMENT WITHIN THE STATE

02:39:29.192 --> 02:39:30.594
STRUCTURE THIS IS DIFFERENT

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:31.995
WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:39:32.062 --> 02:39:33.297
WITH OUR- COMPLIANCE

02:39:33.363 --> 02:39:36.266
RESPONSIBILITIES. WITH RESPECT

02:39:36.333 --> 02:39:36.900
TO FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY

02:39:36.967 --> 02:39:40.237
GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE THE ACTUAL

02:39:40.304 --> 02:39:40.704
ENTITIES RUNNING THESE

02:39:40.771 --> 02:39:43.874
FACILITIES. JUST WAIT A MINUTE

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:44.541
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:39:44.608 --> 02:39:46.410
OPENET- I THINK THE MEMBERS

02:39:46.476 --> 02:39:48.245
HAVE HAD GREAT COMMENTS AND

02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:49.913
NOTING THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:52.015
ISSUE AND- I HAVE TO. REITERATE

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:55.152
WHAT- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HOWARD

02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:55.953
JUST MENTIONED ONE OF THE

02:39:56.019 --> 02:39:57.988
ISSUES WITH. YES YOU SEE IN

02:39:58.055 --> 02:39:59.656
THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE IS BACK IN

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:01.325
BEING PRESCRIPTIVE FROM A STATE

02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:02.826
AGENCY TO THE COUNTIES AS FAR

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:04.828
AS MANDATE IT MUST AND MUST NOT

02:40:04.895 --> 02:40:06.396
DO. IT OPENS UP POTENTIAL

02:40:06.463 --> 02:40:08.165
ISSUES WITH STATE REIMBURSABLE

02:40:08.231 --> 02:40:09.099
MANDATES ARE PROP THIRTY

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:13.971
TRIGGERS AND I THINK. THAT'S

02:40:14.037 --> 02:40:14.871
ONE OF THE DIFFICULT ISSUES. OR

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:16.640
DOES IT YOU CAN NAVIGATE HOW.

02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:17.507
DIRECT COUNTY AND PROVIDE THEM

02:40:17.574 --> 02:40:20.477
WITH. AND TECHNICAL. WITHOUT

02:40:20.544 --> 02:40:23.480
ISSUING ANY KIND OF. IRAQ

02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:24.681
MANDATE THAT WOULD BE

02:40:24.748 --> 02:40:25.615
REIMBURSABLE BY THE STATE

02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:27.317
SAVINGS I THINK IT'S A VERY

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:28.385
COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT THE

02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:29.686
RESTORATION IS HAPPY TO HAVE

02:40:29.753 --> 02:40:30.854
THE CONVERSATION IN SUPPORT OF

02:40:30.921 --> 02:40:33.757
MOTOR ROBUST OVERSIGHT OF THAT

02:40:33.824 --> 02:40:44.501
COUNTY JAILS. SO IT'S THE I

02:40:44.568 --> 02:40:47.571
THINK IT'S COMPLICATED SO WE

02:40:47.637 --> 02:40:50.941
LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN

02:40:51.008 --> 02:40:53.510
THIS DISCUSSION TO DO THE

02:40:53.577 --> 02:40:57.814
PROCESS BETTER- AND WE CAN LOOK

02:40:57.881 --> 02:40:59.483
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE STATE

02:40:59.549 --> 02:41:01.385
GIVING MORE MONIES ARE GIVING

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:02.285
MONEY TO THE COUNTY IN THIS

02:41:02.352 --> 02:41:04.154
PROCESS BUT IT NEEDS TO COME

02:41:04.221 --> 02:41:05.489
WITH THE KHAN ABILITY IN

02:41:05.555 --> 02:41:07.791
TRANSPARENCY IN ENSURING THERE

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:08.325
WERE GETTING THEIR MONEY'S

02:41:08.392 --> 02:41:10.427
WORTH AND SO BOTH OF THE POLICY

02:41:10.494 --> 02:41:12.062
PROCESS PART PROCESSING

02:41:12.129 --> 02:41:14.231
COMMITTEES THANK- MISTER JONES

02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:16.033
SAWYER IS A PUBLIC SAFETY OR

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:17.000
THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:18.835
THIS DISCUSSION MUST CONTINUE.

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:20.003
SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY MEET OUR

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.105
GOAL FOR MOVING FORWARD AND

02:41:22.172 --> 02:41:26.176
HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS. AT THAT

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:26.743
TOO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

02:41:26.810 --> 02:41:27.511
ENGAGEMENT. I ARE THERE ANY

02:41:27.577 --> 02:41:28.979
MORE QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:31.715
LET ME MINDFUL OF TIME IS. A

02:41:31.782 --> 02:41:33.850

ONLY- HAVE ANY. EXAMPLES OF

02:41:36.586 --> 02:41:38.588
OTHER OVERSIGHT AND TO SEE

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:40.357
ENTITIES THEY WOULD ENVISION

02:41:40.424 --> 02:41:44.428
THAT THE B. B. SEC SHOULD LOOK

02:41:44.494 --> 02:41:49.566

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:54.071
ONE- THIS. INDIVIDUAL ENTITY

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:57.507
THAT WE IDENTIFIED THAT- FILLED

02:41:57.574 --> 02:41:59.476
ALL THAT. PURSUES THE SAME

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:02.813
GOALS THAT WE RECOMMENDED AND-

02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:05.015
HAS A PROGRAM IN LINE A LINE

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:06.650
WITH THOSE GOALS IN THE WAY THE

SPECIFIC WAYS THAT BE

02:42:07.818 --> 02:42:09.786
RECOMMENDED- BUT THERE ARE A

02:42:09.853 --> 02:42:12.489
VARIETY OF. ENTITIES OUT THERE

02:42:12.556 --> 02:42:14.791
THAT HAVE BITS AND PIECES OF

02:42:14.858 --> 02:42:17.994
WHAT WE- HAVE RECOMMENDED FOR

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.429
THE DIRECTION THAT THE STATE GO

PIECES OF. DATA ON AND- JAIL

02:42:31.942 --> 02:42:35.078
OUTCOMES AND PROC BOTH SO FOR

STRATEGY. TO HOPEFULLY I AM

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:58.335
IDENTIFYING TARGET THE

02:42:58.401 --> 02:42:59.736
FACILITIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY

02:42:59.803 --> 02:43:01.204
TO HAPPEN MOST SERIOUS ISSUES

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:03.640
AND THE GOVERNOR HAS- DIRECTED

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:05.308
THE SEC TO TAKE A STEP IN THIS

02:43:05.375 --> 02:43:06.977
DIRECTION BUT WE AS WE OUTLINED

02:43:09.646 --> 02:43:11.448
THAT THAT AGENCY CAN GO

02:43:11.515 --> 02:43:13.717
FURTHER- AND TEXAS IS ONE

02:43:13.783 --> 02:43:16.219

02:44:20.383 --> 02:44:22.219
THIS YOU COULD SEE CONSIDER-

02:44:22.285 --> 02:44:23.820
AND THEN FINALLY ANOTHER

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:25.789
EXAMPLE THAT WE POINT TO IN THE

02:44:25.855 --> 02:44:27.724
REPORT IS THAT IT. OFFICE OF

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:28.892
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH

02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:30.327
OVERSEES STATE PRISONS IN

02:44:30.393 --> 02:44:32.596
CALIFORNIA AND I WAS NOTED IT

02:44:32.662 --> 02:44:35.899
IS- IT FILLS IN A LARGE DEGREE

02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:37.634
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:38.902
THERE'S VERY VERY IS DIFFERENT

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:40.870
OVERSIGHT- FUNCTIONS THAT ARE

02:44:40.937 --> 02:44:42.239
DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE ON

02:44:42.305 --> 02:44:43.306
CORRECTIONAL OVERSIGHT AND

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:45.575
HAPPY TO. GET MORE IN TUNE IF-

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:47.110
IF THAT BE HELPFUL BUT AT A

02:44:47.177 --> 02:44:50.280
HIGH LEVEL- REGULATION IS JUST

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:52.515
ONE TYPE OF OVERSIGHT FUNCTION-

02:44:52.582 --> 02:44:54.217
THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:56.052
CLOSEST THING TO WHAT THE FCC

02:44:56.119 --> 02:44:56.753
DOES BUT THEN THERE'S

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.888
MONITORING- WHICH IS MORE KIND

02:44:58.955 --> 02:45:00.724
OF LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY HOW

02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:01.424
ARE THE PEOPLEIN THIS

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:09.899
FACILITY- BEING TREATED- AND

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:11.101
IT'S MORE IN. A KIND OF. LONGER

02:45:11.167 --> 02:45:12.269
TERM LOOKING AT X. AND THERE'S

02:45:12.335 --> 02:45:13.770
INVESTING. WITH TO THE A

02:45:13.837 --> 02:45:14.838
SPECIFIC IN THAT HAPPENED. WHAT

02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:16.506
WENT WRONG HERE- THOSE ARE ALL

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:17.941
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND- I. G.

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:20.176
DOES SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS-

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:22.312
SO THAT'S WHAT PART OF THE

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:24.080
REASON THEY HAVE A BIGGER-

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:25.949
BUDGET BUT AND- IT'S MARIN

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:27.050
STAFFING INTENSIVE AS WAS

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:29.185
NOTED- BUT WHAT THINK ONE THING

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:30.453
WE POINT TO IN THE REPORT THAT.

02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:31.388
WE GOT THAT THEY DO

02:45:31.454 --> 02:45:32.656
PARTICULARLY WELL IS THERE

02:45:32.722 --> 02:45:36.092
REPORTING STYLE- IT'S REALLY

02:45:36.159 --> 02:45:38.461
IT'S A LOT WELL ALIGNED WITH.

02:45:38.528 --> 02:45:40.430
THE SEVERITY OF THE VIOLATION

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:42.699
IT'S KINDA WELL ALIGNED WITH-

02:45:42.766 --> 02:45:45.001
HOW SORT OF THE INTENSITY OF

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:47.003
THE REPORT THAT THEY PRODUCE

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:49.039
AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY

02:45:49.105 --> 02:45:52.008
PUT OUT A REPORT- TO SET TO

02:45:52.075 --> 02:45:53.576
SOME DEGREE SIR KIND OF. THEIR

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:54.844
KIND OF RAISED ALARM IN A IN A

02:45:54.911 --> 02:45:55.979
WAY THAT FEELS A MORE

02:45:56.046 --> 02:45:58.515
APPROPRIATE RELATIVE TO. THE

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:01.151
ISSUE AT HAND- IT'S ALSO A VERY

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:03.386
ACCESSIBLE- LANGUAGE FOR THE

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:05.955
LAY AUDIENCE AND THEIR WEBSITE

02:46:06.022 --> 02:46:08.224
HAS- MAKES IT. IS VERY

02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:11.895
INTERACTIVE AND EASY TO LOOK

02:46:11.961 --> 02:46:14.030
AT. TRENDS IF YOU LISTEN AND

02:46:14.097 --> 02:46:16.333
THEY ALSO SORT OF. TRY TO

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:18.101
SURFACE SYSTEMIC ISSUE BASED ON

02:46:18.168 --> 02:46:20.937
THAT- THEY'RE NOT JUST SPEAKING

02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:21.705
TO THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS

02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:23.940
BUT- RAISING ISSUES THAT MAY

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:25.408
REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT

02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:26.776
ON AND GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE

02:46:26.843 --> 02:46:28.311
EYES ON THE FACILITY BOOTS ON

02:46:28.378 --> 02:46:30.246
THE GROUND. I THINK THE SEC IS

02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:32.716
IN A POSITION TO DO- SOME OF

02:46:32.782 --> 02:46:34.517
THAT TYPE OF WORK THAT DATE

02:46:34.584 --> 02:46:36.252
