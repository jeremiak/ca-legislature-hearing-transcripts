HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. BEFORE COMPELLING THIS LEGISLATURE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT ELECTRIFICATION COSTS WE MUST CONSIDER IF THE PORTION OF THOSE FUNDS COULD OTHERWISE BE REDIRECTED. TO INCREASING STATEWIDE RAIL RIDERSHIP. I SHOULD ALSO BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSED ME TO INTRODUCE THIS BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE. LAST YEAR AS A MEMBER OF ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION. I RECEIVED AN UPDATE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. I ASKED WHY DID MAY NOT INCLUDE A SINGLE ALTERNATIVE IN THEIR PROJECT UPDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I ASKED WHY THE ONLY OPTION THEY WERE PRESENTING WAS ONE TO CONTINUOUS ELECTRIFY THE LINE FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD I WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE VARIOUS OPTIONS. IN THIS PROJECT UPDATE. THE AUTHORITY RESPONDED DURING THE HEARING THAT THERE TWENTY NINETEEN UPDATE WAS BASED OFF OF COMMITMENTS MADE.

THIS BILL REITERATES THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN PASSING PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN STATING THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM SHALL NOT REQUIRED OPERATING SUBSIDY. THIS YEAR DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN FROM THE AUTHORITY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE INITIAL SEGMENT CANNOT OPERATE WITHOUT A STATE SUB A SUBSIDY. AND THAT'S CURRENTLY ESTIMATED COST FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE PLAN ALSO MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT THE AUTHORITY BELIEVES ERODING ASSEMBLY- THAT IT DOES NOT VIOLATE PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE AN EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR. WILL BE OPERATING THE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF THE AUTHORITY. AND SO IN ESSENTIALLY WHAT LOOKS TO BE LIKE A- LIKE A BIT OF A SHELL GAME THE AUTHORITY IS SAYING. WELL WE WON'T GET A SUBSIDY TO THE AUTHORITY BUT WILL GIVE A STATE SUBSIDY TO AN EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR THAT THE AUTHORITY CHOOSE IS THAT JUST AS AN END RUN AROUND THE INTENT OF. THE PROPOSITION DELAY NOTED IN ITS REVIEW. OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN THIS IS INCONSISTENT. ENTIRELY WITH PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY THREE TO THIRTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT. WILL CLARIFY THAT NO MATTER WHO OPERATES THE INITIAL OPERATING SYSTEM. THE UTILIZATION OF ANY STATE SUBSIDY VIOLATE PROP ONE EIGHT AND IS THERE FOR ILLEGAL. I THIS IS A TIMELY BILL WHICH IS CRUCIAL BEFORE THE AUTHORITY PROCEEDS WITH ITS TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLANNING BEGINS SEEKING ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. HELEN CARE SYSTEM IS- WITH THIS FROM THE LA- VIA PHONE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE LA DOES ANALYSIS. AND TWO OUT. ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ABOUT COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO WHICH- ONE ARE YOU THERE. HERE YES PLEASE PROCEED. WONDERFUL GOOD AFTERNOON HERE NUMBERS MY NAME IS HELEN THIRTEEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE DOING MARCH AND THIS YEAR OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT REVIEWING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN IN THAT REPORT WE MADE SEVERAL KEY OVERSIGHT ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER REGARDING THE PROJECT- AND I DO HAVE TO SEPARATE THE ISSUE THAT WE READ THAT THE MOST RELEVANT THE BILL WHICH RELATE THE AUTHORITIES EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL REQUIRE AN OPERATING SUBSIDY. I TO SPECIFICALLY IN OUR REPORT WE GET BACK HOW THE AUTHORITY PLAN TO USE A THIRD PARTY PUBLIC ENTITY OPERATE INTERN SERVICE FROM MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD YOU CAN STILL TAKE COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A APPEARS TO BE INCONSISTENT. WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE MEASURE. AB ONE A WRECK TO THAT PASSED TRAINS. PROVIDED BY THE- NOT REQUIRE AN OPERATING CITY IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PLACES. IT APPEARED TO ASK THAT THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT PASSENGERS OF THE SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE GENERAL. I CORPS TAX. A PAY FOR THE COST. OF THE CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROJECT. HOWEVER THAT FORTY PROPOSED APPROACH- WOULD HAVE THE STATE AND GENERAL GENERAL TAX PAYERS- CAME FOR WHATEVER PORTION OF THE- OPERATING COSTS ARE NOT COVERED. YOUR I. EVEN THOUGH THE IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO RECEIVE AT THAT DRAW. UNDER FORTY THE FRENCH IN THE- PLAN. I DON'T KNOW REALLY CHANGE ON FACT THAT STATE WOULD LIKE THERE ARE OF THE SYSTEM DOCTOR COSTS. AT LEAST DURING THAT AND ON SERVICE THE OR SEVEN. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THROUGH THE MODERATORS ANYBODY AND ON THE LINE FOR. THIS BILL. REASON GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IT AND WISH TO HAVE LEAVE COMMENTS. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THERE ARE NO COMMENTS IN MAY COMMENT Q. JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THROUGH THE MODERATORS NO COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION OF THE BELL.

I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION DAY BE THIRTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT BUT ALSO FIRST ONE THE JUST MAKE A COMMENT- AS WE TRIED TO DIAL IN BUT HAD SOME DIFFICULTY ON THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN THE READ THIS BILL. AND I JUST WOULD SAY THAT. THE NOTION OF MAKING THE BEST INVESTMENTS FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT BY ALL OF US THIS IS A PROGRAM I THINK THAT HAS HAD. OVERSIGHT IN IN. DIRECTION PROVIDED NOT ONLY BY THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN BUT- ASK GOVERNOR THE CURRENT GOVERNOR AND IN MANY OTHERS IN THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHORITY HAD BEEN ON A PATH OF MAKING THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AT THIS POINT SO I JUST WOULD ADD THAT TO THE- THE SB THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN- NOW FOR THIRTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL- RESTRICTIONS. I ON BEHALF TO SEARCHES FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO GET OPPOSE THIS BILL THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT ANY AND TO BE THAT HAVE ANY TYPES OF SUBSIDY FROM. BEING ABLE TO WORK AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM IS- IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH HOW WE OPERATE EVERY SINGLE OTHER PROGRAM TRANSPORTATION IN THE STATE. THERE ARE SUBSIDIES PROGRAM FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT ALL BLEND TOGETHER PROJECT. CLEAR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER IT'S A PRIVATE SECTOR. RAIL PROVIDED THE MAY BE BUILDING A TRAIN FROM NEVADA IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR SOME OTHER ENTITY THAT MAY COMBINED THEIR RESOURCES WITH THIS EFFORT SHOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE VOTERS WANTED AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL THE STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

THANK YOU MISTER GIVES APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I REALLY DON'T THINK SO WHY IS THAT- THE CONSTRUCTION IS ONE THING. THE OPERATION. AND THE SUBSIDY NECESSARY TO CLOSE THAT GAP IS AN OPERATIONAL QUESTION. AND I THINK THAT THE BASIC. AB ONE HERE WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BOND IS CLEAR. AND THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN AS WE ARE LOOKING AT IT NOW. SUGGESTS A AND RUN AROUND THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE. IN THE BOND MEASURE WHAT THIS DOES IS. A LINE THE POLICY OF THE STATE MAKING IT VERY VERY CLEAR THAT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TO HAVE AN IMPACT SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS.
