01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.210
WHAT HAPPENED A SMALL BUSINESS

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.678
OWNERS. INDEPENDENT

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:16.646
DISPROPORTIONATELY CLOSE

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.514
MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IS A

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.316
KEY QUESTIONS NOT. THEN ANOTHER

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.851
QUESTION I'VE BEEN INTERESTED

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.152
IN. IS HOW MUCH TOO SMALL

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:24.487
BUSINESSES LOSE AND SALES

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:25.621
DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF A

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.523
PANDEMIC. WHAT TYPES OF

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.092
BUSINESSES WERE HIT HARD OR THE

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.461
WHAT WE THINK- HAS HAPPENED OR

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.129
ARE THERE OTHER INDUSTRIES OR

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.597
TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.399
BEEN AND HEARTS. AND I'VE ALSO

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.367
BEEN REALLY INTERESTED IN

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.868
STUDYING THE GOVERNMENT RELIEF

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.636
PROGRAMS. SO I FOCUSED ON THE

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.238
U. S. ONES THAT PAYCHECK

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.173
PROTECTION PROGRAMS. IN THE I

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.075
DON'T PROGRAMS. AND THE BIG

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.343
QUESTION THERE IS THAT I'M

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.444
INTERESTED IN IS WHETHER OR NOT

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.679
THEY'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTED EVENLY

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.114
TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES ALL

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.516
TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW SOME

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:57.987
OF MY RESEARCH A- TO YOU. NEXT

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.355
SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE TIMING OF

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:02.625
THE PAN. HI THIS IS PRETTY WELL

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.593
KNOWN RIGHT MARCH A LOT THE WAY

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.495
HEALTH OR TO CLEAR NINETY

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:08.131
ATTENDED SAN FRANCISCO AREA

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.365
PRETTY MUCH THE FOR PLACE TO

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:12.301
MAKE AND CHAU IN PLACE RESTRICT.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.103
MARCH THE STATE BECAUSE IMPOSES

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.706
RISK MARCH AT NEW YORK STATE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.041
AND THEN BY EARLY MOST IMPOSE

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.109
SOCIAL DISTANCING. THIS IS

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.411
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT I'M

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.312
GONNA DO IS COMPARE EVERYTHING

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.581
FROM FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.550
SKIP OVER MARCH TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:31.254
AND THEN THEN GO TO APRIL

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:31.821
TWENTY TWENTY SO NEXT SLIDE

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.290
PLEASE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.458
NUMBER OF ACTIVE BUSINESS

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.926
OWNERS IN THE U. S. CD'S ARE

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.661
OWNERS. THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.997
WORK ETHIC IN THEIR BUSINESS SO

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.799
I CANNOT LOOK AT THEIR SALES

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:43.599
HERE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THAT

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.902
A SECOND ANOTHER PROJECT. BUT

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.070
HERE I'M JUST LOOKING AT

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:48.004
WHETHER OR NOT THE BUSINESS

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.972
OWNER IS CURRENTLY ACTIVE. IT'S

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.541
ACTUALLY RELATIVELY STEADY THIS

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.009
IS FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.444
IT'S RELATIVELY STEADY OVER

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.345
TIME. BUT WHAT YOU SEE IS THIS

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.014
UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF THE DROP

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:00.149
IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY. IF YOU

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.517
COMPARE THIS TO THE GREAT

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.920
RECESSION. IN THAT ONE MONTH.

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.255
OF APRIL WE LOST TWENTY OVER

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:09.225
20% OF ACTIVE BUSINESS OWNERS

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.227
OVER THE ENTIRE GREAT RECESSION

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:14.363
WE ONLY LOST FIVE PERCENT. NEXT

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.966
LIGHT. THERE WERE

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.835
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.736
MINORITY GROUPS SO AFRICAN

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.672
AMERICANS WE SAW A LOSS OF

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.108
FORTY ONE PERCENT. LAST NEXT

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:28.177
32% AND ASIAN. BUSINESS OWNERS

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.480
26% SO THOSE NUMBERS WE JUST

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:34.617
MENTIONED CEMEX FIGHT. NOW WHAT

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:35.818
I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN SINCE

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.386
THAT KIND OF EARLY BROWN OF

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.055
CLOSURES HAS THERE BEEN A

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:39.889
REBOUND TO SOME OF THOSE

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.958
BUSINESSES ONLY TEMPORARILY

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:46.329
CLOSED AND REOPEN. EXIDE I KNOW

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.497
THERE'S BEEN A STEADY

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:49.198
IMPROVEMENT IN ACTIVE BUSINESS

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.235
OWNERSHIP EVERY SINGLE MONTH UP

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:55.138
UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY K.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:58.107
PLEASE NEXT FIVE. THAT GROWTH

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.343
HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH COVERED BY

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.544
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.079
POPULATION SEATED ON THE FAR

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.314
LEFT HERE YOU CAN SEE- THE

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.616
NUMBERS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.118
THE MIDDLE ONE IS FOR LATIN.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.187
AND THE THIRD- SET UP

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.723
GROCERIES- CENTER CALLS IS FOR

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.392
ASIAN AMERICANS SO FOR AFRICAN

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.060
AMERICANS AND LATIN ACTS BUT WE

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.328
SEEN AS KIND OF A STEADY

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:23.633
INCLINE. BUSINESS OPENINGS.

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:24.367
ASIAN AMERICANS THERE IS BEEN A

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:25.735
DIFFERENT STORY WE CAN TALK

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:26.736
ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT MORE

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:27.937
MEDIAN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.772
BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.607
RELATIVELY AND KNOWING WHAT

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.309
HAPPENED THERE WHY IT STALLED

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:37.647
OUT. OKAY NEXT LINE. WHAT IS

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:40.883
HAPPENED SINCE OCTOBER IS. IS

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.718
CONCERNING. THERE HAS BEEN A

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.754
DROP IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY IT

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.289
HAPPENED NOVEMBER IT HAPPENED

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.723
IN SEPTEMBER AND IT HAPPENED

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.492
AGAIN IN THIS LATEST STATED BUT

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.593
AS I MENTIONED JUST BECAME

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.495
AVAILABLE A FEW DAYS AGO. AND I

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:55.898
PREPARED. FOR THIS HEARING. SO

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:56.666
WHAT YOU SEE IS THE STEADY

01:03:56.732 --> 01:04:00.570
MONTH TO MONTH TO MONTH DECLINE

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:01.103
OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:04.140
SINCE OCTOBER. THE NEXT SLIDE.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.841
WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA SO

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.310
I GENERATE NEED ESTIMATES FOR

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.946
CALIFORNIA. FOR THIS HEARING SO

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:14.951
NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE IS

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.587
EXACTLY THE SAME PATTERN. RIGHT

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:18.521
WE SEE THIS KIND OF RELATIVELY

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.723
STEADY BUSINESS OWNERSHIP

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.626
ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA OVER YOU

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.227
KNOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND A

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.062
HALF OR SO THE BIG DROP IN

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.798
APRIL FROM FEBRUARY IN A MONTH

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.367
BY MONTH. INCLINE IN RATES

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.469
UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:34.870
THEN A REVERSAL RIGHT SO

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.073
CALIFORNIA IS ESSENTIALLY

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.242
FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE SAME

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.577
PATTERN AS THE U. S. OVERALL HE

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.913
NEXT LINE. SO THAT WOULD BE

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.114
REALLY INTERESTING TO COMPARE

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:47.650
THIS DIRECTLY RIGHT SO WE SEE

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:48.751
THE SAME PATTERN IN CALIFORNIA

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:51.354
IS THE LAST. BUT HOW. DIFFERENT

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.689
ARE THEY THE CHANGES OVER TIME

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.558
SO THE GOLD BARS HERE SHOW

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.627
CALIFORNIA THE BLUE BARS SHOW

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.829
UNITED STATES AND WHEN YOU CAN

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.198
SEE IS EARLY OFTEN THE PANDEMIC

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.400
SO IN APRIL MAY JUNE CALIFORNIA

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.102
WAS ACTUALLY HIT HARDER RIGHT

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.536
SO THE SHUTDOWNS WERE MORE

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.138
SEVERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.641
HAPPENED IS- IN OCTOBER

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.309
NOVEMBER THEY WERE RELATIVELY

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.344
SIMILAR BUT THEN WHAT YOU SEE

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.980
IS IN DECEMBER JANUARY OR SEEN

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:18.514
KIND OF THE SAME TYPES OF

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.417
CLOSURES. AND SO REALLY WHAT'S

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.752
HAPPENED IS KIND OF THIS KIND

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.020
OF MORE RECENT RAMPART

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.054
SHUTDOWNS IS BEEN ROUGHLY THE

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.056
SAME AS CAL IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.825
THE WEST- CALIFORNIA SEEING A

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.494
10% DROP INSTEAD OF A 6% DROP.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.562
BUT THE OTHER MONTHS- WERE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:38.034
PRETTY SIMILAR. NEXT SLIDE.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.303
YEAH DOES THIS LOOK BY I IN

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:43.205
RACIAL. SO IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.341
SAMPLE SIZES ARE TOO SMALL FROM

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.309
THE DATA THAT I'M USING TO

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.277
REPORT AFRICAN AMERICAN NUMBERS

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.346
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S- A

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.081
SIMILAR PATTERN FOR LATIN ACTS

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.849
AS OVERALL CALIFORNIA. THAT

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.017
THERE WAS A BIG DECLINE IN

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.519
APRIL AND THEN THERE WAS KIND

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:58.354
OF THIS MONTH BY MONTH REBOUND.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.690
AND THEN KIND OF A STEADY WELL

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.258
YOU KNOW KIND OF PLATEAU AREA

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.259
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.294
SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE LAST

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.029
COUPLE OF MONTHS. ASIAN

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.065
AMERICANS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.033
MORE OF A KIND OF A STUBBORN

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.569
RECOVERY THERE. THAT IS A

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:14.603
MENTION BEFORE IS NOT ENTIRELY

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.205
CLEAR IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT'S

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:17.707
PARTLY DUE TO TYPES OF

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.075
INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.210
ASIAN AMERICANS ON- MANY OF

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.745
THEM ARE IN KIND OF MORE PERSON

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:23.779
TO PERSON CONTACT TYPE

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:25.581
BUSINESSES. AND YOU CAN SEE

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:28.317
FINALLY FOR. WHITE NONLIFE

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:33.689
BACKS ON BUSINESSES CEMEX.

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.991
FIGHT NOW I'VE ALSO BEEN DOING.

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.060
ON LOS IN CAL. IT'S A-

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.895
DIFFICULT TO GET KIND OF. I'VE

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:40.663
BEEN WORKING WITH THE

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:41.697
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.766
AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.669
AT AVERAGE SALES LOSSES. ALMOST

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.471
ALL OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.405
ON THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:53.576
TWENTY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:54.343
WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.378
QUARTER BECAUSE THAT INCLUDES

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:57.680
APRIL MAY JUNE SO YOU CAN SEE

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.548
HERE IS TAXABLE SALES GROWTH

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:03.185
OVERALL GROWS ABOUT 325% EVERY

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:05.020
QUARTER AND THIS IS YOUR OVER

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.956
YOUR GROWTH SO WHAT YOU SEE

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:09.191
THAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER THERE

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.160
WAS A BIT OF A DECLINE. IN THE

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.196
SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.231
WAS WHEN WE SAW HUGE DECLINES

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:16.899
OR LOOKING AT IT A DROP IN

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.301
TOTAL SALES OF BUSINESSES IN

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.636
CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN PERCENT-

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.138
IT'S VERY INTERESTING IS THAT

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.173
IN THE THIRD QUARTER WE SEE A

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.409
REAL BIG CHUNK BACK NOT ALL THE

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:27.510
WAY BACK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.779
ABOUT 325% GROWTH RANGE BUT ALL

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:32.415
THE WAY BACK TO ESSENTIALLY

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.616
ZERO GROWTH SO WE WERE NOT SEEN

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.084
LOSSES THEN. THIS IS OF COURSE

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.385
COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.320
OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO I'M

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:39.121
NOT COMPARING THIS TO THE

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.589
PREVIOUS QUARTER WHICH I THINK

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.191
WAS THE KIND OF A BIG MISTAKE

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:46.195
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. GDP

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:46.929
NUMBERS FOR THE U. S. NEXT

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.166
SLIDE PLEASE. NOW HOW DID THIS

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.300
HIT DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.469
BUSINESSES YOU CAN SEE THE ONES

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.236
THAT WE REALLY EXPECTED TO BE

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:57.373
HIT HARD ACCOMMODATION IS THE

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.775
ONE IN BLUE IN THE FAR LAST.

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:02.311
REAL NICE AND 90% DROP IN SALES

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.146
IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.247
TWENTY SO WAS JUST DEVASTATED

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:07.316
AND BACKORDERS DRINKING PLACES

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.485
ALCOHOLIC ARE YOU KNOW CARS.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.420
THAT WAS HIT EXTREMELY HARD.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.022
YOU CAN SEE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.924
RACKS FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.459
WERE HIT HARD HIT STORES

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.427
CLOTHING STORES ALL THE ONES

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:20.196
THAT WE CAN EXPECT BUT THE

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:22.198
LOSSES WERE PRETTY SEVERE RIGHT

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.532
WE'RE SEEING LOSSES A FIFTY.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.767
DOLLAR ALL THE WAY UP TO NINETY

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.902
PERCENT. ON THE FLIP SIDE A LOT

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.737
OF INDUSTRIES THAT DID FINE

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:30.706
THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO GROW.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.641
AND WANTED REALLY STICKS OUT IS

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:33.976
NON STORE RETAILERS WHICH

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:36.879
INCLUDES ONLINE. AND THAT GROUP

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.581
BY A HUNDRED EIGHTY PERCENT.

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:43.919
OVER COURT IN QUARTER TWO OF.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.187
TWENTY POINT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:45.788
IN THE RESEARCH PROJECT THAT

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.957
WERE ON IT ALL LOOKS REALLY AND-

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:50.159
IN HOW THIS RELATED TO. THE

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.027
NUMBER OF KOBE CASES ANY COPING

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:55.231
CASES PER CAPITA EARLY ON. SO

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:55.965
THESE ARE BACK IN APRIL AND

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.633
MAY. AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.534
THERE SEEM TO BE A NEGATIVE

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:00.236
RELATIONSHIP SO REMARKABLY

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:01.971
CASES THAT WERE BEING RECORDED

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.739
PER CAPITA. IT LOOKS LIKE

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:04.840
CONSUMERS WORK AND I'M MORE

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.476
NERVOUS ABOUT GOING TO STORES

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:09.745
AND SHOPPING AT THE STORES. OUT

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.413
IT ALSO COULD BE RELATED TO

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.548
KIND OF MORE ENFORCEMENT OF

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.383
CLOSURES BUT THIS TIME THERE

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.018
WASN'T THAT KIND OF COUNTY BY

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:19.154
TIMELY CLOSURES THAT WE SEE NOW.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:24.293
NEXT SLIDE. I'VE ALSO BEEN VERY

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:24.860
INTERESTED AS I MENTIONED IN

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:26.395
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AID THE PPP

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.197
AND I DON'T PROGRAMS IN THE

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.065
CARRIAGE ACT THE ROUTE TO

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.567
PRIORITIZE SERVING UNDERSERVED

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.135
MARKETS AND BUSINESSES ON BY

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.236
SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.438
DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS SO

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.907
THE QUESTION I WAS INTERESTED

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.875
IN PEACE LONG PROGRAMS COACH

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.977
MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO I WAS

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.812
ABLE TO GET DATA FROM FIFTY

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:44.947
MILLION DIFFERENT LOANS TO

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.250
ANALYZE THIS REALLY CAREFULLY

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:50.286
CEMEX SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHAT I

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.353
FOUND IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.455
THE FIRST ROUND OF DPT PROGRAM

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.690
THERE ACTUALLY IS A VERY STRONG

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.358
NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.093
MINORITY SHARE THE COMMUNITY.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.062
SO THOSE FUNDS DID NOT FLOW TO

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:01.797
MINORITY COMMUNITIES EARLY IN

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.400
THE FIRST ROUND WHAT HAPPENED.

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.001
IS CONGRESS REALIZE THIS AND

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:07.736
THEN SWITCH THE PROGRAM TO

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.171
REALLY GO OUT AND BE MUCH MORE

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.372
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT GETTING LOCAL

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:13.876
COMMUNITY BACK BANKS. FINANCIAL

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:16.879
TECH. INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.180
TYPES OF LENDING AND FINANCIAL

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.416
INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD TARGET

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.785
LOW INCOME MINORITY AREAS AND

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:23.586
WHAT WE FOUND IS IN THE SECOND

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.988
ROUND IT DID REVERSE AND THAT

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.791
MINORITY- COMMUNITIES TO GET

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:33.829
LOANS. CAN BACKSIDE. SO WHAT

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:34.597
CAN WE DO TO ME FORWARD I THINK

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:35.831
THEY'RE SORT OF FOR TAKEAWAYS

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:36.966
FROM THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:38.000
DONE IN THE PRESENTATION THAT

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.202
I'VE GIVEN. YES I THINK THERE

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.204
ARE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:43.772
CONSUMERS NEED TO FEEL SAFE

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:44.974
AGAIN. WE NEED TO GET THE

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.375
VACCINE OUT WE NEED TO GET OUT

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:48.410
FASTER IN MY OPINION. YOU KNOW

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.812
PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GO BACK

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.980
TO RESTAURANTS AND SHOPS AND

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.448
DAKOTA DOWNTOWNS AND SHOP

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.650
LOCALLY BUT THEY ARE GOING TO

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:57.419
BE RELUCTANT TO DO THAT POLICE

01:10:57.486 --> 01:10:58.554
YOU'LL SIX. I ONE IS MEAN NEED

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.155
MORE. ASSISTANCE I THINK THIS

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.523
IS A CRITICAL PERIOD FOR A LOT

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.125
OF SMALL BUSINESSES. I THINK

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.194
RENT RELIEF IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.362
SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT THAT

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.364
BILL. PASSED YESTERDAY IN THE

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.399
GOVERNOR IS LIKELY TO SIGN IT

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:14.670
TODAY. WE ALSO NEED TO SLOW

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:15.838
ONLINE SHOPPING WHICH IS

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.640
HAPPENED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:18.707
SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.743
MORE OF AN ONLINE PRESENCE SO

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:21.610
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.512
HELP IS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.614
OF- ONLINE SEARCHES SEARCH

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.549
ENGINES. THEY OFTEN WILL SHOW

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.851
KIND OF BIG BOX STORES ARE

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.653
LARGER RETAILERS WOULD BE GREAT

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.521
IF THEY COULD FOCUS ON SMALL

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.089
BUSINESSES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.692
SO THAT. YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.327
CAN PRIORITIZE THEM. I MEAN I

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.762
THINK MORE DATA ON RACE NEEDS

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.930
TO BE COLLECTED THAT IS CLEAR.

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:43.832
D. P. PT LOAN. PROGRAM WAS

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.267
CRITICIZED HEAVILY FOR NOT

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:46.635
COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION THE

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:48.437
RESEARCH THAT I SHOWED YOU JUST

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:49.672
LOOK AT THE MINORITY SHARE THE

01:11:49.738 --> 01:11:51.840
COMMUNITY AND NOT. ACTUAL LOAN

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:53.375
RECIPIENTS I THINK THAT WAS A

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.711
HUGE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE. AND

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.212
ALSO THIS WAS ACTUALLY

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:59.815
MENTIONED EARLIER IN IN THIS IN

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:02.685
THIS- SESSION. IS A COLLECTION

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.253
INFORMATION APPLICATIONS.

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.688
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:07.322
WHO'S APPLYING FOR THESE LOANS

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:08.691
AND WHO'S GETTING DENIED FOR

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:12.895
THESE LOANS. IS. THERE RACIAL

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.997
EQUITY. IN THAT. BACKSIDE

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.832
PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THIS

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:17.633
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.368
FINDINGS MY RESEARCH I LOOK

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.469
FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.404
COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:23.539
YOU FOR OUR CHAPTER I

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:24.907
DISCOVERED QUICKLY DO YOU KNOW

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.875
WHAT DO YOU HOPE FOR A POLICY

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.210
LEADERS CAN TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.279
RESEARCH AND- WHAT OTHER

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:33.015
RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO PERHAPS

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.416
ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:36.018
CAN TAKE TO MITIGATE THE

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:38.754
DISPARITIES AMONG. DIFFERENT

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:41.557
BUSINESS OWNER GROUPS. YEAH I

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:42.291
MEAN I THINK THE ONE OF THE

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.592
THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE FIRST

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:44.860
NEED THAT KIND OF INFORMATION

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.862
RIGHT IF WE HAD BETTER RECENT

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.764
FORMATION ON APPLICATIONS. BUT

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.598
A RECENT FORMATION A LOAN

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:51.433
RECIPIENTS I THINK WE COULD

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.001
START TO LOOK AT THIS EXTREMELY

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:55.204
CAREFULLY. RIGHT NOW I FEEL

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:56.839
LIKE CHARLIE MY HANDS AND OTHER

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.807
RESEARCHERS ANSWER TIGHT WE

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:01.009
IT'S SO HARD TO GET THE DATA TO

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.945
BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.613
WHAT'S GOING ON SOME OF THE

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.581
THEORIES ARE THERE IT'S A LACK

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.783
OF INFORMATION ANOTHER ONE IS

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.885
THAT IT'S A LACK OF. OF KIND OF

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.386
THESE MORE LONGER ESTABLISHED

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:13.589
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS SO IF

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.824
WE CAN BREAK THOSE PROBLEMS AND

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.760
GET MORE INFORMATION OUT-

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:21.263
CREATE. YOU KNOW QUICK MORE.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.397
YOU KNOW LIKE SHORTER TERM

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:24.333
ESTABLISHMENTS WITH BANKING OR

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.906
THAT COULD REALLY HELP. OUR ONE

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:31.507
OF THE STATEMENTS JUST MADE A

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.408
MOVING FORWARD- THAT SMALL

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:34.843
BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE MORE OF

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.311
AN ONLINE PRESENCE HOW DO YOU

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.515
PROPOSE THAT CONVERSATION START

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:40.115
WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHAT

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.651
DO WE DO. YEAH THAT'S A TOUGH

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.520
ONE TO- I THINK ONE OF THE

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.188
THINGS THAT COULD HELP. IS HOW

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.890
TARGETED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:50.793
DIRECTLY FOR. CREATING WEB

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:53.028
PAGES FOR CREATING. YOU DON'T

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.697
WASTE THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.666
RESIDENTS TO SHOP ONLINE AND

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.334
LOCAL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW WE

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.203
COULD ALSO TRY TO PUT A LITTLE

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.439
BIT CRUSHER ON SEARCH ENGINES.

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:05.707

PRIORITIZE LOCAL BUSINESSES

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.011
RIGHT I MEAN THE PROBLEM THERE

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:11.113
IS A LOT OF THAT IS BASED ON AT

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.615
REVENANTS RIGHT AND THAT MAKES

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.484
IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. BUT YOU

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:16.351
KNOW MAYBE AT THIS POINT IN

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:19.822
TIME GIVEN THIS SEVERE CRISIS.

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:21.957
AND THIS. POTENTIAL WE'RE GONNA

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:23.926
LOSE SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:24.393

YOU NEED BECAUSE THIS IS SUPER

01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.981
VALUABLE- AND HELPING US TO

MAKE GOOD POLICY DECISIONS FOR

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.617
THE STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:49.918
THAT I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT- AND

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.353
YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT IN

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.421
YOUR PRESENTATION OF YOU DON'T

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.356
HAVE THE DATA THAT SIGN. I'M

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.391
WONDERING ABOUT THE EXPONENTIAL

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:59.061
IMPACTS OF MINORITY OWNED

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.629
BUSINESSES COMBINED WITH

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.264
COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCE

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.365
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.000
THEY HAVE LOWER SPENDING

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:07.035
CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.337
THOSE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.005
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.640
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:12.908
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT THAT

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.643
KIND OF ADDITIVE OR EXPONENTIAL

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.245
IMPACT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:17.779
SPENDING COME UP CAPACITY IN

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.414
THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE MAYBE

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.482
THEY'VE BEEN HARDER HIT BY

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.850
COVERT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.552
MORE UNEMPLOYMENT THEREFORE

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:24.386
THEY HAVE LESS DISPOSABLE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.221
INCOME. THAN THAT HOW THAT

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.223
RELATES TO HELPING- THE

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.958
MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHO

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.360
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:34.396
BEEN MORE SEVERELY IMPACTED

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.163
THIS THAT MAKES SENSE. YES IT

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.266
DOES. YOU KNOW SORT OF LOCAL

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.201
DOLLARS LOCAL I THINK IT'S KIND

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.469
OF THE SAME. THAT'S REALLY

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.137
IMPORTANT HERE. BUT I THINK

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.772
IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT THERE IS

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.641
A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.876
SHOWS THAT WHEN. YOU LOOK AT

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.211
THESE KIND OF SMALLER MINORIT

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.780
OWNED BUSINESSES. TEND TO HIRE.

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:54.216
COLLECT MIX SALUTE IF YOU LOOK

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:54.983
AT BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES FOR

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.919
EXAMPLE THEY TEND TO HIRE OTHER

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.287
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THOSE

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.955
BUSINESSES THOSE JOBS OFTEN ARE

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.690
VERY LOCAL. THE SUPPORT THAT

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.825
COMMUNITY AND SO NOT ONLY ARE

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.228

COMMUNITY AND THAT'S A

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.770
DISADVANTAGED AREA. THEN YOU'RE

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:15.637
HELPING THE SMALL BUSINESS

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.139
OWNER YOU'RE HELPING CREATE

01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:19.441
JOBS IN THAT LOCAL AREA. AND

YOUR CREATING WEALTH AND THAT

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:23.378
WEALTH OF COURSE ANY SPENT OR

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:24.479
AT LEAST IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:29.584
SPENT BACK IN THAT COMMUNITY.

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:30.185
AND SO THERE'S DEFINITELY THIS

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.020
MULTIPLIER. ANY OTHER COMMIT

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.556

AND THEN TIE BACK TO YOUR

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:43.665
SLIDE. AS FAR AS THE- SECTORS

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:46.401
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:48.470
OCTOBER NINETEENTH. AND SO MY

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.005
FIRST QUESTION IS WITH THE SHUT

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.441
DOWNS- WHERE THEY DRIVEN BY

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.643
CERTAIN SECTORS MEANING- WERE

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.645
SOME OF THE SECTORS HIT HARDER.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.547
THAN OTHERS- IN WHICH

01:16:58.613 --> 01:17:00.849
BUSINESSES AND WHICH SECTORS

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.819
WHERE THEY- YES THAT WAS ONE

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:04.586
THING THAT WAS NICE IS BEING

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.388
ABLE TO GET THE SALES DATA

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:07.889
STATE CALIFORNIA. YOU COULD SEE

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.491
THAT ACCOMMODATIONS WAS THE ONE

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.126
THAT WAS HIT THE HARDEST. SO

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.661
THERE WAS A 90% DROP IN

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:16.465
REVENUES. TO THOSE BUSINESSES.

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.399
THAT IN SOME OF THE OTHER ONES

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.368
THAT WERE HIT HARD COURTS WERE.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.303
HOURS WERE IT VERY HARD. NO BUT

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.971
A LOT OF SMALL SHOPS THAT WERE

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:24.906
SHUT DOWN SO CLOTHING. GIFT

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:26.708
SHOPS YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.378
BUSINESSES WERE HIT EXTREMELY

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:31.747
HARD. AND WHEN YOU YOU TALKED

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.914
IN YOUR PRESENTATION OF A

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.484
REBOUND- WITH JOBS AND

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.718
BUSINESSES REBOUNDING OPENING

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.087
UP. DID THAT FOLLOW THE SECTORS

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.155
THAT WERE HARDEST HIT OVER

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:41.923
THOSE DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.959
WE'RE CONTINUING TO EXPAND AND

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:46.328
REBOUND FROM THE CALL THE

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:49.331
NINETEEN- ECONOMIC IMPACT. SO I

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.433
DON'T HAVE THE DATA TIED TO

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.602
THOSE INDUSTRIES SO I WAS

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.303
FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON YOUR

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.439
QUARTER TILL TWENTY TWENTY. SO

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.807
I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.742
THAT IT IS BECOMING AVAILABLE

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:01.510
AND WILL BE ABLE TO STUDY THAT

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.478
SAM AND SEE WHERE THE REBOUNDS

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:06.848
WERE SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.884
TARGET. THANK YOU AND WE LOOK

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.118
FORWARD TO SEEING THAT BAD

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:10.919
INFORMATION SO WE COULD

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.088
PINPOINT- CERTAINLY THOSE THAT

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.423
ARE REBOUNDING BUT THEN THOSE

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.857
THAT THAT HAPPENED. THAT NEEDS

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:19.728
SOME ADDED- ADVOCACY FOR THEM I

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:21.096

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.633
GROWTH A SALES GROWTH

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:26.668
PERCENTAGE. AND SOME OF THE

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.236
SECTORS THAT WOULD DRASTICALLY

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:32.107
HIT BY. THE IMPACT OF TWELVE

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.342
NINETEEN BUT ALSO- SHOWING THAT

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.510
SOME BUSINESS SECTORS CONTINUED

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.712
TO HAVE A GROWTH PERIOD- DURING

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:39.681
THIS TIME. SO THAT THAT WHAT

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:41.516
I'M IN IN MY MIND ALLOW US TO

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:44.419
FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON THE TRUE

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.520
BUSINESSES THAT ARE BEING

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:47.856
IMPACTED. BY COVERT NINETEEN SO

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:49.524
THAT WE CAN GET ALL OF THEM

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:52.861
REBOUNDING BACK INTO THE

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.930
ECONOMY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A SIMILAR

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:00.769
QUESTION TALKED FAIRLY- ONE OF

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:01.770
YOUR EARLIER SAW SLIGHT

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:02.671
INDICATE THAT THE ASIAN

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:05.073
BUSINESSES ARE. SOMEWHAT SLOWER

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.275
AND RECOVERY- COMPARED TO THE

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:10.579
OTHER GROUP SO. I WAS WONDERING

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:11.179
WHETHER OR NOT DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:13.615
OF. DATA SHOWING THE BREAKDOWN

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.750
BY INDUSTRY OR BY SECTORS

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:18.620
REGARDING THESE BUSINESSES.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:19.721
WHEN I DID SOME OF MY EARLIER

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:22.290
WORK I DO TRY TO. KIND OF FOCUS

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.892
ON INDUSTRY DIFFERENCES ABOUT

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:24.860
WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.661
FOUND IS THAT ASIAN BUSINESS

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.230
OWNERS AND ACTUALLY OTHER

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.664
MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES.

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:31.500
TENDED TO BE IN INDUSTRIES THAT

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:33.401
WERE SHUT DOWN MORE IN APRIL IN

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.370
OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO ONE GOOD

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.172
EXAMPLE IS AGRICULTURE'S ONE OR

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.141
IF IT'S DONE WELL IF YOU LOOK

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:40.308
AT THE OWNERS OF AGRICULTURAL

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:42.144
BUSINESSES THEY TENDED NOT BE

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:44.112
MINORITY ALL. YOU DON'T WORKERS

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.714
OFTEN ARE MINORITY WORKERS IN

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.916
THOSE INDUSTRIES BUT NOT THE

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:48.550
OWNERS OF THE BUSINESSES SO YOU

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.751
THINK IT YOU KNOW I'M TALKING

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:52.721
NATIONALLY HERE- THAT A LOT OF

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:55.857
THE FARM OWNERS ARE. ARE- ARE

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.726
NOT A MINORITY OWNS IT SO THAT

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:58.326
DADS ROLL SOME OF THE

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.128
DIFFERENCES BUT ALSO JUST

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.129
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.797
PERSON TO PERSON CONTACT YOU

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:04.533
KNOW YOU THINK OF. BARBER SHOPS

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:06.902
NAIL SALONS REALLY SMALL RETAIL

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.237
STORES THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.605
WERE KIND OF HIT THE HARDEST

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.907
YOU KNOW EARLY ON WITH CLOSURES

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:14.342
AND HAVE SEEN THIS KIND OF. YOU

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:16.178
KNOW OPENING SHUTTING DOWN

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:22.050
OPENING YOU DON'T RE OPENING.

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:22.617
AND SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:25.153
PART OF IT. LET ME GO AND TURN

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.022
TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MANY. AND A

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.391

BREAK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.307
THE COUNTIES. OF THE FIFTY

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:46.241

SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:41.287

IF I NAY MADAM CHAIR I'M- IT IS

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:01.373
IT'S A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR MAYBE

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:03.542
TO THE QUESTION I ASKED OF OUR-

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.044
EARLIER PANELISTS BIT ODD.

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.112
CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:07.713
CHALLENGES ARE CERTAINLY NOT

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.615
GOING TO BE UNIQUE YOU NEED FOR

02:03:09.682 --> 02:03:10.583
CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.184
SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:13.552
WERE FACING ACROSS THE NATION

02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:15.654
AND INDEED ACROSS THE WORLD. SO

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:18.124
ARE THERE OTHER STATES THAT ARE

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:21.761
ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:22.695
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OR DOING

02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:24.730
A REALLY GOOD JOB AT UPSKILLING

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:27.500
RETRAINING. OUR WORKERS AND

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:28.434
PREPARING THEM FOR THE JOBS OF

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:32.438
TOMORROW. IS THERE ANYWAY WE

02:03:32.505 --> 02:03:35.141
CAN LOOK TO DO IT AS A MODEL.

02:03:35.207 --> 02:03:36.842
NOT FOR ANY ANY OF THE

02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:40.379
PANELISTS WHO HAVE A FEW. RIGHT

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:42.381
I THINK THERE ARE FEW STATES-

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:43.716
FIRST OF ALL CALIFORNIA WITH

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:45.151
EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL DOES

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:47.219
SET THE STANDARD IN MANY CASES

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:49.121
FOR OTHER STATES THERE ARE VERY

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:49.722
MANY OTHER STATES THAT DON'T

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:53.125
HAPPEN. THIS FORM OF- OF- OF

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:56.128
THE WORK FORCE- SUBJECT OF

02:03:56.195 --> 02:04:02.768
BIRDS ARE SUBSIDIZATION OF THE.

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:04.904
I CAN SEE THAT BIG. WILD STATES

02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:07.606
IN WHICH THEY RESIDE AND OPEN.

02:04:07.673 --> 02:04:08.707
MUCH LATER ADVANTAGE OF

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:09.875
TRAINING AND THEY CAN'T ANOTHER

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:10.643
STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:12.411
POSSIBLY TEXAS OR ARIZONA OR

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:14.013
SOMETHING ELSE. IN TERMS OF

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.381
THOSE STATES THAT ACTUALLY

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:18.250
HAVE- YOU KNOW GOOD GOOD

02:04:18.317 --> 02:04:19.552
PROGRAMS I THINK NEW JERSEY

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.353
PROBABLY HAS A GOOD ONE AS I AS

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.422
I REMEMBER. IN IN LOOKING AT

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.291
SOME OF THIS- THEY THEY DO A

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:26.625
NICE JOB BECAUSE THEY DO A

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:29.195
TERRIFIC JOB OF CONNECTING- THE

CAN DO THAT- IS REALLY DOING A

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:43.042
GOOD JOB AND THEN I THINK NEW

02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:44.610
JERSEY ALSO SUPPORTS IT WAS

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.011
SOME KIND OF FUNDING. IN TERMS

YOU SO MUCH AND I'LL TRY TO

02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:50.042
MAKE THIS CHRIS QUICK- YOU KNOW

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.609
ONE OF THE THINGS KNOW THE

02:05:50.676 --> 02:05:52.311
PENDING. AND IS THAT IT REALLY

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:54.847
HIGHLIGHTED THE NEGATIVE

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:58.317
IMPACTS OF LONG- SUPPLY CHAINS

02:05:58.384 --> 02:05:59.952
FOR OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR.

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:02.021
SO WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:02.821
MORE ON SHORING OF

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:04.490
MANUFACTURING. AND WE KNOW WE

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:06.292
HAVE AN AND NOT ONLY HAVE I

02:06:06.358 --> 02:06:08.260
HAVE. IS THERE MORE TO DO

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:10.396
BEFORE THAT. TO CREATE THE

02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:12.197
SKILLED WORKERS WORK FORCE FOR

02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:15.501
MANUFACTURING. BUT WE ALSO NOW

02:06:15.567 --> 02:06:17.469
HAVE A LARGE SECTOR OF.

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:19.939
UNEMPLOYED FROM HOSPITALITY

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:22.074
FROM RETAIL FROM RESTAURANTS.

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:23.876
SO MY QUESTION AND IT GOES BACK

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:25.177
TO MISTER WATSON WHAT YOU WERE

02:06:25.244 --> 02:06:27.012
SAYING IS WE NEED TO BE BETTER

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:29.982
AT BRIDGING. THAT THE JOB SKILL

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:31.951
NEEDS AND THE TRAINING THAT OUR

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:34.153
COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR OUR OTHER

02:06:34.219 --> 02:06:36.722
PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE. IT IF YOU

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.791
COULD GIVE ME YOU IT MAYBE-

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:41.293
MISS- CRAVEABLE CAN GIVE US.

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.695
THE TOP THREE THINGS THE

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.964
LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO BRIDGE

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:46.398
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ONLY DO

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.500
WE COME UP TO. A GOOD LEVEL BUT

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:49.568
WERE ABLE TO INCREASE AND

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:52.037
ABSORB SOME OF THAT AND IT

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:52.604
TREAT RETRAIN SOME OF THOSE

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:56.642
UNEMPLOYED WORKERS. THE TOP ONE

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:57.376
TWO THREE THINGS WE SHOULD DO.

02:06:57.443 --> 02:07:01.180
GO WELL I THINK FIRST NEWS IS

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:03.582
AFTER IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:07.720
FOR- INCOME TRAINING AND FOR-

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:09.088
APPRENTICE TRAINING WOULD BE

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.557
WOULD BE TO TALK TO FOR ME- I

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:13.158
THINK I THINK THOSE ARE THE

02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:15.494
AREAS THAT I THINK WE CAN IN

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:16.161
TERMS OF CITIES IN

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:19.431
MANUFACTURING WE CAN CERTAINLY-

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:21.767
BUT A LOT OF. STUDENTS IN THOSE

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.035
TWO AREAS. IF WE HAD THE

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:25.170
FUNDING AND IF WE COULD GO OUT

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:26.705
AND WORK WITH MANUFACTURERS TO

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:29.575
BE ABLE O- TAKE NEW WORKERS

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:31.143
OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.545
AND UNIVERSITIES. AND EXTREME

02:07:33.612 --> 02:07:35.748
AFTER. WE GET WE NEED TO GET

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:36.749
THIS BRIDGE AND THEN FROM THERE

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:38.183
I KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:39.752
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIGN ON. HOW

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:40.686
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:42.855
RETRAINING- THEIR STUDENTS BUT

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:43.822
I KNOW MOST OF TWO STUDENTS

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:45.657
TRAINED IN MANUFACTURING. WE

02:07:45.724 --> 02:07:47.059
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:50.329
INTO THE. MANUFACTURING

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:50.829
COMMUNITY AS QUICKLY AS

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:52.998
POSSIBLE. I WOULD LIKE TO- ADD

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:55.934
ON. ON TO THAT THAT.

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:57.736
MANUFACTURES WON'T COME BACK

02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:58.937
WITHOUT A SKILLED WORKFORCE

02:07:59.004 --> 02:08:01.774
STATE THE BILL ONLY COME BACK

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.841
IF WE HAVE THAT SKILLED

02:08:02.908 --> 02:08:06.612
WORKFORCE. SO AGAIN. A GREEN

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:08.147
1100% WITH MISTER WATSON.

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:10.682
SPENDING IS THE NUMBER ONE WE

02:08:10.749 --> 02:08:12.785
NEED TO BE ABLE TO. TRAIN THESE

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:14.920
INDIVIDUALS. AND PUT THEM TO

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:16.688
WORK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.290
CONVINCE MANUFACTURERS THAT WE

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:21.827
HAVE A SKILLED. WORKFORCE THE-

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:24.863
THE OTHER IS ACCESS TO SOFTWARE.

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:27.499
THERE'S MANY GREAT SOFTWARE.

02:08:27.566 --> 02:08:28.834
PLATFORMS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:32.805
THAT WE CAN USE AGAIN FUNDING

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:33.572
TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE TAX

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:36.442
SOFTWARE. PLATFORMS THAT WE CAN

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:37.843
WORK IN A HYBRID WORLD OR

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:41.246
VIRTUAL WORLDS WHICH EVER ONE

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:42.581
REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU LOOK AT

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:45.017
IT. AT LATIMES SOFTWARE HELPS

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:46.618
US TO BECOME SAFETY BEFORE WE

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:49.555
DO ACTUAL HANDS ON ACTIVITIES.

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:52.324
AND THEN I WOULD SAY ONE OTHER

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.392
ASPECT THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:55.761
TALKED ABOUT HERE AND I WOULD

02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:56.595
SAY THE THIRD ONE WOULD BE.

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:59.231
BUSINESS IS ACCEPTING JUSTICE

02:08:59.298 --> 02:08:59.665
INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:03.902

02:09:05.504 --> 02:09:06.538
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:08.006
BACKGROUNDS IF WE'RE TRYING TO

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:09.475
SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE THEM

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:11.376
INTO BACK INTO SOCIETY. THEY

02:09:11.443 --> 02:09:13.312
NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND IF

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:14.880
THE MORE BUSINESSES THAT TELLEM

02:09:14.947 --> 02:09:17.616
NOW NOT ONLY CONTINUES TO PUT

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:19.084
THEM INTO ONE DIRECTION AND

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.953
THAT IS TO BACK TO RESET UPDATE

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:22.855
AND GO BACK TO PRISON. WE NEED

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:24.990

THESE COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.080

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:22.554
INTENDED TO HELP WE ASK YOU TO

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.622
CONSIDER A FEW THINGS THAT ARE

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.123
UNIQUE TO THE RESTAURANT

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:27.759
COMMUNITY. ONE WE WERE ONE OF

02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:29.060
THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:31.029
STATE SAID WE ARE PEOPLE HAPPY

02:19:31.096 --> 02:19:32.597
AND MORE PROUD OF THAT.

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:33.932
RESTAURANT LABOR COSTS ARE

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:35.200
HIGHER THAN ELSEWHERE IN THE

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:37.135
NATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:37.869
WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA

RESTAURANTS BEEN SHUT LONGER

02:19:40.405 --> 02:19:40.872
THAN ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:42.574
SECTOR NATIONWIDE. MY MAIN

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:43.608
POINT HERE IS JUST THAT

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:44.809
RESTAURANTS HAVE HIGH NUMBERS

02:19:44.876 --> 02:19:46.878
OF EMPLOYEES. WHICH DOESN'T

02:19:46.945 --> 02:19:48.980
NECESSARILY REFLECT BIG

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:50.882
BUSINESS VERSUS SMALL BUSINESS.

02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:52.751
AS RESTAURANTS WITH EVEN ONE

02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:55.687
TWO OR THREE LOCATIONS CAN

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:56.221
QUICKLY ADD UP TO LOTS OF

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:57.989
EMPLOYEES. SINCE THE PAYCHECK

02:19:58.056 --> 02:19:59.557
PROTECTION PROGRAMS BEEN CITED

HERE A FEW TIMES IN THIS

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:01.960
HEARING I WANTED TO JUST POINT

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:03.795
OUT A FEW THINGS. CALIFORNIA

FOR TWO REASONS. ONE LOAN

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:12.804
AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON LABOR

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:14.506

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:23.548
ORDERS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:20:23.615 --> 02:20:25.550
LIMITED. OR IN MOST CASES

02:20:25.617 --> 02:20:27.218
PROHIBITED SAID INDOOR DINING

AND MUCH OF THE STATE'S IN

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:31.389
SPOTS MUST MARCH. ONE OF THE

02:20:31.456 --> 02:20:32.857
KEY OBJECTIVES OF THAT TV

02:20:32.924 --> 02:20:33.691
PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE

02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:35.360

THE PAYROLL. NO ANSWER GIVEN AT

02:20:37.929 --> 02:20:39.430
THE RESTAURANT SPENT AT LEAST

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:41.800
60% ON LABOR RESTAURANTS GOT

02:20:41.866 --> 02:20:43.468
BIGGER LOANS IN BOCA THAT MONEY

02:20:43.535 --> 02:20:45.203
FLOW THROUGH TO WORKERS HAS

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:48.206
INTENDED. SO AGAIN THE NUMBER

02:20:48.273 --> 02:20:49.407
OF RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES OR

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:50.942
SIGNS OF A RESTAURANT LOAN DOES

02:20:51.009 --> 02:20:52.277
NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE TO

02:20:52.343 --> 02:20:53.311
WHETHER A RESTAURANT IS BIG OR

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:55.213
SMALL OR UNSTABLE ECONOMIC

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.948
FOOTING. THE NEST MAJORITY THE

02:20:57.015 --> 02:20:58.283

VAST MAJORITY OF THE COUNTIES.

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.692
SO SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:09.227
THE STATE BEGINS TO AUTHORIZE

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:10.695
COUNTIES TO ALLOW US BACK

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:12.664
