NOTHING REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM BETTER THAN SURFING. CATCHING THE GOLDEN WAVES OF OPPORTUNITY AND HARM ME HARMONY WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT. WITH MINIMAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SURFING WAS ORIGINALLY THE SPORT OF HAWAIIAN ROYALTY. SO IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE DURING ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH ONE OF THE GREATEST CULTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE. BY NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THREE WHOLE Y. AND PRINCES. INTRODUCED SURFING TO CALIFORNIA AND SANTA CRUZ. EVER SINCE THEN SERVING AS BECOME AND ICONIC AN INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND CULTURE. SURFING DEFINES THE CALIFORNIA STYLE. AND THE CALIFORNIA STYLE AND INSPIRES A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR GLOBAL INDUSTRY. SUPPORT FASHION TOURISM AND RECREATION. ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF CERTAIN CALIFORNIA SURFING IS THE METHODS OF RESPECTING AND PROTECTING THE OCEAN. AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND SOON AS CALIFORNIA'S RECENTLY INVENTED THE WORLD'S BEST WAVE PARK.

LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND AND PROVIDING SERVE CANCER TRYING GET INNER CITY CITY KIDS TO PARTICIPATE IN SURFING. AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS LIKE CLEAN WATER GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES DISADVANTAGED COUNTRIES LIKE INDONESIA ANOTHER FLIGHT OTHER PLACES THAT SURFERS TEND TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUT IN IN HELPING THEM GET CLEAN WATER AND AND AND LIFTING UP THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SURFING IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT LOVE. ABOUT PASSION AND IT'S ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT A LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE SURFERS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ADVOCATING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE. OF SOMETHING THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO US IN FOR AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW OUR IDENTITY CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO IN OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. IN OUR ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AND SURFING.

THE BILL HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN POLICY AND FISCAL COMMITTEES AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NIGHT. THANK YOU MISS GRAYSON MISTER KILEY YOUR RECOMMENDS. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA TO PASS LAWS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL? BECAUSE SUCH ALONG OR REALLY LAWLESSNESS CAN WRECK HAVOC. WHEN OUR STATE INTEL A COURT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THROW IT OUT. BUT THAT'S NOT MY ARGUMENT THAT'S THE VERY ARGUMENT. BEHIND THE BILL BEFORE US. THAT A BILL WE PASSED JUST LAST YEAR S. B. FIFTY IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE CONCORD REUSE PROJECT IN FACT THE AUTHOR STATEMENT FOR TODAY'S BILL SAYS THIS IS JUST ONE OF NUMEROUS. PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA QUOTE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS NEW STATE LAW S. B. FIFTY AND AS A REFRESHER WHAT S. B. FIFTY DID. WAS REALLY. SOMETHING QUITE REMARKABLE. IT SAID WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO TRANSFER LAND EITHER TO ANOTHER ENTITY OR A PRIVATE PARTY. THEN I AS THERE'S OFTEN GOOD REASON TO DO AS IN THE EXAMPLE BROUGHT UP BY THE AUTHOR TODAY. THEN WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN INTERPOSE OURSELVES WE CAN SAY NO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN CALL THE DEAL OFF AND THE STATE CAN THEN GRABBED THE LAND FOR ITSELF. OR EVEN IT IF IT DOESN'T IT CAN'T ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR STEPHEN FOR TODAY'S BILL IMPEDE THE TIMING. OF THE TRANSFER. NO EVEN WOULD S. B. FIFTY WAS PASSED. NO ONE SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN ACTUALLY DO. UNDER THE US CONSTITUTION. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY'S BELL BECAUSE SB FIFTY IS IN FACT CURRENTLY BEING CHALLENGED IN COURT AND TODAY'S BILL WOULD ELIMINATE A BASIS FOR STANDING ON THE PART OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT. BUT WHY DO I SAY THAT NO ONE AT THE TIME S. B. FIFTY WAS PASSED SERIOUSLY THOUGHT IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL. WELL FOR ONE THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S OWN ANALYSIS SAID THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT FEDERAL COURTS WOULD FIND OF THIS BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE PROPERTY BECAUSE. OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO MOCK ARGUMENTS MADE IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA THAT THE BILL WAS CONSTITUTIONAL. IN ADDITION IT TO VIOLATING THE PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION I THE ISSUE OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION HAS ALSO BEEN RAISED BY THE ONGOING LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO WHICH AGAIN TODAY'S BILL WOULD ELIMINATE. A BASIS FOR STANDING. THEN WE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL PREEMPTION AUTHORITY ALONG WITH SOME OBSCURE STATUTE OR REGULATION. BUT THE FEDERAL LAW THAT S. B. FIFTY VIOLATES IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. IT'S A LAW PASSED BY CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY. AND OF THAT DATE SOUNDS FAMILIAR THE TITLE OF THAT FEDERAL LAW WAS AN ACT THROUGH THE ADMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE UNION. THE ACT PROVIDED THAT SAID STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ADMITTED INTO THE UNION UPON THE EXPRESS CONDITION THAT THE PEOPLE OF SAID STATE THROUGH THEIR LEGISLATURE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NEVER INTERFERE WITH THE PRIMARY DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC LANDS WITHIN ITS LIMITS. AND SHALL PASS NO LAW AND YOU KNOW ACT WHEREBY THE TITLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO AND RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF THE SAME SHALL BE IMPAIRED. AND QUESTION. THAT'S RIGHT LAST YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE. PAST A LAW THAT EXPRESSLY VIOLATES A CONDITION OF CALIFORNIA'S STATEHOOD. ON TODAY'S MEASURE I'M URGING MEMBERS TO WITHHOLD YOUR VOTE. INTEL THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO EXEMPT FROM THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL S. B. FIFTY NOT JUST ONE TYPE OF TRANSFER. BUT ALL TRANSFERS FOR EXAMPLE ONE PROJECT THAT'S BEEN HAMSTRUNG BY THE BILL IS THE RESULT VITAL IS ASIAN OF THE VA IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT ACRE. WEST LA CAMPUS THAT PROJECT INVOLVES LEASING PROPERTY TO PROVIDE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND SERVICES FOR LOCAL VETERANS AND ISSUING AN EASEMENT TO LOS ANGELES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PLAN PURPLE LINE METRO PROJECT. NOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF AFTER THIS BILL WE START GETTING OTHER BELLS ASKING FOR FURTHER EXEMPTIONS FROM SD FIFTY FOUR OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS UNTIL S. B. FIFTY IS FINALLY AND INEVITABLY STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS I THINK I'D BE A LOT EASIER. AND WOULD SPARE A LOT OF HARM TO A LOT OF PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IF WE SIMPLY AMENDED THIS BILL TO TAKE SB FIFTY OFF THE BOOKS NOW AND I HOPE THAT THE NEXT TIME WE'RE TEMPTED TO PASS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW. WE REMEMBER THIS THAT THAT IS A LOSE LOSE FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. MISTER STONE YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BILL AND HANDS MOST OF THAT WAS REALLY ABOUT A PREVIOUS BILL YOU CAN CRITICIZE THAT BILL ALL YOU WANT I APPRECIATE. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CONCORD. WORKING ON A PREVIOUS LAW WHICH IS WHAT WE DO ON A REGULAR BASIS FIND FLAWS AND MOVE IT FORWARD. WHETHER YOU'RE FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH BILLS LAST YEAR OR NOT. THAT TIME HAS PASSED WHAT IS BEFORE US IS A BILL THAT ADDRESSES A VERY REAL ISSUE A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE. AND IF YOU WANT TO THROW OUT THE BENEFIT THAT IT DOES. BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER DESIRE TO AMEND THIS BILL I SUGGEST. YOU CAN ALWAYS INTRODUCE YOUR OWN BILLS THAT'S OUR AUTHORITY HERE ON THE FLOOR. THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE BILL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS TO MOVE FORWARD AND I ASK FOR YOUR I'VE. THE IMAGE DOWN SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MR GRACING YOU MAY CLOSE. YES I DO WANNA THANK. COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SCOTTS VALLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN ALSO JUST TO REMIND AS WAS STATED IN THE OPENING STATEMENT THAT THE BILL HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND POLICY IN FISCAL COMMITTEES AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I. WITH THAT CLERK LOCAL ROLL-ON MEMBERS OF THE. DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF THOSE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. THE CLERK WILL. CLOSE TO ROLL EYES FIFTY TWO KNOWS ONE THAT MEASURE PASSES. FILE ITEM NINETY NINE PASS RETAIN THAT BRINGS US TO FILE ITEM ONE HUNDRED. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT CORPORATE ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BY FAMILY MEMBERS STEINORTH AND ACTUALLY THE HOUSING MISTER STEINORTH. IF YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE THE COUNTY OF SALMON MEDINA WITH AN ADDITIONAL MECHANISM TO DEVELOP OPERATE IN FINANCE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS. BY JOINING IN THE PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE COUNTIES OF SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CLARA ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR BY AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SEVEN GLORIA. THIS WILL INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING PROJECTS TO BOTH MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO WHICH ARE LARGELY UNDERSERVED. OUR STATE POLICIES OFTEN PREVENT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FROM CLIMBING THE LADDER OUT OF POVERTY BECAUSE THEY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. WE MUST TAKE IN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE GROWING MIDDLE MISSING MIDDLE THAT IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS. ALLOWING THE COUNTY TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL MIXED INCOME PROJECTS GIVES THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THE COST PENCIL OUT. BY INCORPORATING MARKET RATE AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING TO HELP PAY FOR LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL EVERYONE IS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED THIS LEGISLATION ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HAS HAD NO OPPOSITION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THEY CAN BE STEINORTH.

RELEVANT TO THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL TENANCY. SOME SECTIONS OF THE CIVIL CODE NUMBER COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE LAW IS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUALS. INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTIAL TENANTS AND NOT THE COMPANIES IN THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS NATURE OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. OVER TIME AND WHERE IT MAKES SENSE AN EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO CLARIFY AND OR SEPARATE AREAS OF THE LAW. WHERE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO TREAT COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL TRANSACTIONS IN THE SAME MANNER? THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON CONSENT.

THIRD READING FILE. FILE ITEM ONE OF SEVEN IS S. B. SIX OH SIX CORPORATE. SENATE BILL SIX OF SIX BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AND ACTUALLY TO WATER. MISS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX OH SIX. LAST YEAR AFTER THE MOST OF YOUR DROUGHT IN MIND MODERN HISTORY I AND OTHERS IN THIS HOUSE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF MAKING LONG TERM WATER USE. IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS MORE SUSTAINABLE. THE BILL AND IT'S A COMPLETE UGH PANNION AB SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND SHIRTS OUR STATE WILL BE MORE PREPARED TO HANDLE FUTURE WATER SHORTAGES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. IT IS A FRAMEWORK FOR DROUGHT RESILIENCY IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND FOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY. A FRAMEWORK BUILT ON HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF MEETINGS SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISES AND FINDING COMMON UNDERSTANDING. IT IS FAIR TO WATER SUPPLIERS AND EMPOWERS THE LEGISLATURE NOT THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL FOCUSES ON THE EFFICIENT USE OF WATER RATHER THAN CURTAILING WATER RIGHTS AND LOCAL DISTRICTS ARE IN CONTROL ABOUT HOW. AND WHERE TO FIND WATER SAVINGS NOT SOME STATE AGENCY. THE BILL HELPS COMMUNITIES TO GROW BY ADJUSTING THEIR TARGETS AS THEY ADD NEW RESIDENTS BUSINESSES AND PARKS. IT IS PROVIDED. IT PROVIDES FOR GRADUATE FORCE MEANT BY THE STATE WATER BOARD AND STRICTLY PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM REQUIRING CIVIL PENALTIES ON WATER USES. THE BILL INCLUDES VARIANCES AND ALLOWANCES FOR SPECIAL AND UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER THAN FORCING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BONUS INCENTIVE FOR WATER DISTRICTS THAT HAVE INVESTED IN ME POSSIBLE REDUCE SYSTEM. THE RESULT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE PART OF. GROUPS AS DIVERSE AS ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT BUT I'M NRDC AND PEPSI ALL SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND COMPLICATED PROCESS BUT S. B. SIX A SIX AND A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL SET US ON THE RIGHT PATH FORWARD. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SENATE BILL SIX ALL SIX. THANK YOU MS RUBIO MISTER ALAN YOU'RE RECOGNIZE. I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB SIX OH SIX A LOOK AFTER THIS LAST MOST RECENT AND SEVERE DROUGHT. THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE DOING IS GIVING ANY MORE POWER TO STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS CALIFORNIANS SAY MORE WATER THAN ANY OTHER STATE WHERE THE MOST WATER CONSCIOUS STATE IN THE NATION. YET WHEN WE PASSED THIS WATER BOND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION OF WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO NEW WATER STORAGE WHICH ACTUALLY WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. NOT ONE PENNY OF THAT BOND MONEY WAS SPENT. AND NOW JUST RECENTLY IN SACRAMENTO. THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION DENIED FUNDING NECESSARY. TO FINANCE TEMPERANCE FLAT. WHICH WOULD'VE BROUGHT WATER TO THE ENTIRE CENTER CENTRAL VALLEY. WE HAVE SITES RESERVOIR WE NEED TO RAISE SHASTA DAM WE NEED TO BUILD THOSE THE CARIS THERE'S WATER PROJECTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE STATE THAT THE STATE WATER COMMISSION. DOES NOT WANT TO BILL BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY DO NOT PENCIL OUT THE LAST THING WE NEED IS MORE WATER MANDATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE DO NEED IS TO COMPLETE THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER PROJECT WE NEED TO BUILD NEW WATER STORAGE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS WE ACTUALLY STORE OUR WATER? AND DON'T ALLOW FIFTY PERCENT OR MORE OF OUR WATER EVERY SINGLE YEAR TO FLOW AND THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. THIS BILL IS THE EXACT WRONG APPROACH YET AGAIN BY SACRAMENTO IT'S TELLING CALIFORNIA'S IT WE LEAVE THAT WE LIVE IN A STATE OF SCARCITY. WE DON'T LIVE IN A STATE OF SCARCITY LAYS ADJOURNMENT WE LIVE IN A STATE OF ABUNDANCE ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO USE OUR TEXT FOR OUR TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE. WE NEED TO BUILD NEW WATER STORAGE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN STORE MORE WATER. NOT FIGURE OUT WAYS HOW TO TAKE WATER. SOME CALIFORNIANS IN EVER GREATER QUANTITIES WHICH EXACTLY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WANTS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL WANTS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION IS ONE TO DO NOW. GOING BACK DECADES WE'D TO BUILD NEW WATER SOURCES OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED FLOOD THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE'D ACTUALLY HAVE WATER STORAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S GET GREEN LAWN TO TAKE LONG SHOWERS THIS IS THE EXACT WRONG APPROACH YET AGAIN FROM SACRAMENTO I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS. LET'S BILL MORE WATER STORAGE NOT IN POWER STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CALIFORNIA. MISTER GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. IT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION EVERYBODY SHOULD BE VERY FOCUSED ON BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT. ON EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT. IT IS GOING TO IMPACT YOUR WATER RATES IN YOUR DISTRICT. IT'S GOING TO IMPACT HOW MUCH CREDIT YOU GET FOR THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'RE COMMUNITIES HAVE MADE. AND RECYCLING WATER AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. INTO ME. WHAT'S SAD IS THAT YOU KNOW WE STARTED THIS OUR. WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS WE'RE BRINGING LOTS OF STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS GONNA BE A LEGISLATIVE. DRIVEN PROCESS. AND THAT PROCESS LARGELY BROKE DOWN. WE HAD SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS BUT WE NEVER REALLY SAW. THE AMENDMENT SAID A LOT OF US WERE TALKING ABOUT. NUMBER ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE IN CONTROL THAT WE SHOULD BE IN CONTROL TO MILLIE OF HOW WE STEP HOW WE SET STANDARDS THIS BILL STILL GIVES THAT POWER. ULTIMATELY TO THE WATER BOARD TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. ANOTHER THING IN THIS. BILL DOESN'T DO AS IT DOESN'T GET RID OF THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL MODEL THIS STILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO SET STANDARDS BASED ON THE WATER BUDGET. MODEL AND THERE'S LARGELY NOT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND TO USE OTHER METHODS OF BITTER IT LOOK EVERY EVERYBODY KNOWS SIT IN THIS ROOM THAT WATER NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. SOME AREAS HAVE MADE LARGE SCALE INVESTMENTS ARE RECYCLED WATER. OTHERS OF US HAVE VERY STRONG GROUND WATER TABLES AND AND WE HAVE BACKUP WATER SUPPLIES THAT PUT US IN A STRONGER POSITION. SOME ARE REALLY FACING SOME REAL DIRE STRAITS WITH REGARD TO GROUND WATER. AND THEN THEY NEED ADDITIONAL WATER SUPPLIES. IT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND YET THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. AND IT'S GONNA LARGELY GIVE ONE AGENCY OR WHOLE LOT OF A POWER TO SET. AN ARBITRARY. STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA HAVE VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT. SO WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. RECYCLED WATER YES THERE IS IN HERE AN INCENTIVE. THAT ALLOWS FOR FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR EXISTING FACILITIES. AND TEN PERCENT FOR NEW FACILITIES THAT SHOULD BE CONCERNING FOR ABOUT IN HERE IF WE REALLY BELIEVE. IN EXPANDING MORE RECYCLED WATER FACILITIES WIRE WE CREATED A DISINCENTIVE. YOU GET FIFTEEN IF YOU'VE GOT AN EXISTING BUT IF YOU CREATE A NEW ONE YOU GET LESS. CREDIT. TO ME THAT'S SORT OF BACKWARDS. YOU'LL FINALLY I THINK THAT. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. WHY OR WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO GIVE OKAY OUR AUTHORITY AND THE I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE BIG THE BIGGEST THING HERE WHY DO WE CONTINUE? THIS IS A BIG ISSUE WE SHOULD BE DRIVING THAT PROCESS IT'S OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE IMPACTED. BY A VERY BROAD REACHING POLICY. IT SO WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT WE ACTUALLY LET'S TAKE THIS BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD LET'S CONTINUE TO WORK ON A THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO HAD. INFLUENCE ON IT BUT TO ME WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'RE REALLY AFRAID OF A BUDGET TRAILER BILL COMING SO WE'LL JUST TAKE WHATEVER WE CAN GET. AND MOVE FORWARD AND SOME ARE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY GOT A FEW THINGS THEY'RE ASKING FOR. BUT LARGELY THIS IS STILL VERY FLAWED. POLICY. THAT YOU'RE QUITE DO YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL BE ASKING YOU ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS WHEN YOU'RE WATER RATES START GOING UP. AND THEY'RE SAYING WHY IS THIS HAPPENING IN WELL BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO COMPLY WITH S. B. SIX A SIX. AND WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WHO JUST PASSED SOME VERY DRACONIAN REGULATIONS ON ALL OF US. SO I REALLY ASK I WOULD REALLY ASK YOU MAY NEED TO STAY OFF THIS BILL OR VOTE NO. BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THANK YOU. MS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I I RISE I'M BEHALF OF MY FARMERS IN MY LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO ARE SOUTH OF THE GRAPEVINE SO GONNA SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THOSE OF US DOWN SOUTH FLORIDA'S. PAYS SOME OF THE HIGHEST WATER RATES IN THE STATE. AND EVERYTHING DOWN THERE IS BROWN SO WE CAN'T WATER ANYTHING OUR LAWNS OF BROWN'S. THE CITY OF ESCONDIDO THAT I REPRESENT HAS THE TERTIARY TREATED WATER. OF RECYCLING PLANT BUT IT'S HAD NOW FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I OPPOSE THIS BILL ALONG WITH ALL OF MY LOCAL WATER AGENCIES. I THIS BILL IMPOSES A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WATER USE STANDARD. THAT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR UNIQUE LOCAL CONDITIONS. OR THE INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S AN EXAMPLE INVESTMENT. IN RELIABLE SUPPLY LIKE POTABLE WE USE FOR RAW WATER RECYCLING. THIS WILL UNDERMINE THOSE PAST EVENTS INVESTMENTS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND UNDERCUT FUTURE EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY WATER. MORE RESILIENT SECURE AS WE HEARD. FORMER COLLEAGUE IT DOES A DISINCENTIVE TICKET EVEN LOOK AT EXPANDING ON RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS. SO. I OPPOSE THIS EXPANSIVE NEW AUTHORITY AND VIRGIN THOUGH VOTE. MR VALLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ALSO RISE IN IN OPPOSITION AND I ALSO. LIKE TO SHARE THAT I WAS PART OF THAT BIPARTISAN. INITIAL GROUP IN THERE WERE SEVERAL BILLS OUT THERE AND. I WILL SAVE FROM A DISTRICT WHO PRODUCES ABOUT. SOME AROUND SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STATE'S WATER. THE FOLKS WHO ARE SOUTH TO ME WHICH IS. I GUESS FROM ABOUT WILLOWS I WOULD SAY SOUTH IS SOUTH. BUT YOU DONE A GREAT JOB OF WATER CONSERVATION LEADING THE WORLD IN WATER CONSERVATION YOU'RE GONNA GET PENALIZED. FOR BEING A GOOD STEWARD OF YOUR WATER. IN THE FUTURE AND WE'RE NOT IN A. SPOT WHERE WE HAVE TO RIGHT NOW MAKE THIS DECISION WHAT IS THE URGENCY. WERE ON IN A FULL BLOWN DROUGHT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT TAKE THE POWER BACK TO THIS HOUSE. AND PUT UP POLICIES THAT WORK FOR INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF THE STATE. SO I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON THIS GIVE US SOME TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO AREN'T HAPPY WITH THIS. WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I WILL GUARANTEE YOU IF YOU'RE. SOUTH OF SACRAMENTO. THIS WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU IS GOING TO DRIVE YOUR RATES UP AND IT'S NOT GONNA INCREASE MORE WATER. SURE MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER COLLINS THE I'VE GOTTA ECHO A LOT OF THESE REMARKS YOU KNOW WATER IS DIFFERENT WHETHER YOU'RE FROM NOR CAL. SO CAO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY LA% COACHELLA VALLEY SAN DIEGO. OR THE EAST SIDE OVER AND OWNS VALLEY. MEMBERS I HELL FROM THE CITY OF PORT OF VILLAGE A FEW YEARS AGO WAS THE CITY WITHOUT WATER. AND I'M ASKING YOU FOR NO VOTE. SENATE BILL SIX A SIX FAILS TO PROVIDE LOCAL MANAGEMENT AND WATER PLANNING FLEXIBILITY. WHICH IS EXTREMELY NEEDED. S. B. SIX OR SIX PROPOSES A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THE FELLS TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. IN EACH COMMUNITY. THERE WAS. GRANDA LOCAL WATER SUPPLY INVESTMENTS ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE WATER RATES WITH OUT. COMMENSURATE BENEFIT AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LOCAL ECONOMY. FOR URBAN WATER. SUPPLIERS WHERE'S MY LA CAUCUS. WHICH HAD AMPLE SUPPLIES FOR. THE DROUGHT ENIK SHE'D MANDATE STATE. CONSERVATION LEVELS THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE UNNECESSARY. ONE LESSON LEARNED. FROM THIS PAST DROUGHT IS THAT FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING. SHORTAGES. PLANS ALLOWED WATER AGENCIES TO BE CREATIVE. AND CALL UPON THAT OF I'VE EARNERS WATER SUPPLIES THEY HAVE TO DEVELOP. AND PAID. FOR TO WHETHER DROUGHT CYCLES. THIS BILL LACKS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM LOCAL WATER SUPPLIERS. ACCORDING TO THE COALITION WATER. AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RELATED ASSOCIATIONS QUOTE SENATE BILL SIX ALSO WORKS. GRAND STATE AGENCIES EXPANSIVE NEW ENFORCEMENT POWERS. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE WATER SUPPLY TO TAKE PUNITIVE ENFORCEMENT. ACTIONS ON THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THE AUTHORITY TO DENY STATE GRATTON LOAN FUNDS FOR FAILURE TO ME. AN UNDEFINED STANDARD OF COMPLIANCE. SENATE BILL SIX OH SIX IS ENFORCEMENT. PROVISIONS NEED TO BE SHIFTED AWAY FROM PROVIDING YOU PUNITIVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO THE STATE AGENCY AND POURED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ANY INFORMATION SHARING ALONG THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT REPORTING PLAN AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE SATISFIED. CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE TO CONSERVE WATER. CHANGES TWO BEHAVIORS FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT THAT ARE MADE. FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES DURING THE DROUGHT HAVE GENERALLY BEEN MAINTAINED. ACCORDING TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THEMSELVES CALIFORNIA'S WATER SAVING HER EACH. EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. COMPARED TO OCTOBER TWENTY THIRTEEN PUDDLE WATER PRODUCTION. FOR THE. THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SUPPLIERS REPORTING. BASED ON THE ESTIMATES THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON USES POINT TWO ACRE FEET OF WATER PER YEAR THIS SAVINGS IS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY. TWO THOUSAND. FOR. HE TWO OR TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH WATER. FOR ONE YEAR. FORTY ONE PERCENT OF SUPPLIERS REPORTING AN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ACHIEVED WATER SAVINGS. BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT COMPARED TO THE SAME MONTH IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE SUPPLIER SERVE MORE THAN. TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE TEN PERCENT A SUPPLIER SERVING MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA'S REPORTED WATER SAVINGS. OF TWENTY PERCENT OR MORE. THIS CONTAINS PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE THAT MAY ALLOW THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS WITH OUT CALIFORNIAN FIREMAN ó QUALITY ACTION REVIEW. SENATE BILL SIX OH SIX SPECIFIES AN ACTION OF THE BOARD TAKEN UNDER THIS CHAPTER SHALL BE DEEMED. TO BE A CLASS EIGHT ACTION A CLASS EIGHT EXEMPTION UNDER SEQUEL CONSIST OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. TO AUTHORIZED BY STATE OR LOCAL ORDINANCE TO ASSURE. THE MAIN ANSWER RESTORATION ENHANCEMENT OR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE REGULATORY PROCESS INVOLVES PROCEDURES. TO PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THIRTY SECONDS MR MATHIS. MEMBERS I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ ALL MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS AYE IT THIS BILL QUITE FRANKLY ROOM RATE REMINDS ME OF OF SOMETHING OUT OF. IT A ANY ADVENTURES MOVIE WHERE WHERE YOU WOULD HEAR THE. ON THE DOOR IN AN AGENCY SAYING. YOUR COMPLIANCE WILL BE REWARDED. THIS ISN'T A HELL HYDRILLA. THIS IS REAL LIFE THIS IS PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS. THE IDEA OF GIVING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD MORE POWER TO COME KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR. TO SAY HEY GUESS WHAT YOUR COMPLIANCE WILL BE REWARDED CONSERVE MORE. CONSERVE MORE ONE ASKING YOU. MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES CONSERVE YOUR VOTE LAY OFF LET'S GET THIS RIGHT. FUTURE GENERATIONS DEPEND ON IT. THIS FRIEDMAN. YOUR ATTACKS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE REYES THERE MIGHT CENTER SPEAKING TODAY ON THIS ISSUE IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IN TERMS OF THIS BILL ITS COMPANION BILL AB SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT FOUR YEAR AND A HALF. ANOTHER BUILT ON CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING UP HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THE LESSONS FROM THE LAST LAST DROUGHT. WE'RE VERY IMPORTANT WE SAW IN THAT DROUGHT THAT THERE WERE SOME WATER AGENCIES THAT WERE VERY PREPARED TO DEAL WITH DROUGHT IN THEIR OTHER WATER AGENCIES THAT WERE NOT PREPARED TO DEAL WITH DROUGHT. ONE THING THAT WAS CONSISTENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHERE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SAYING. WHY ARE WE NOT A MORE EFFICIENT STATE? WHY DO WE NOT HAVE? ADEQUATE PREPARATIONS IN SO MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE. MY CONSTITUENTS THAT TO ME WHERE VERY EFFICIENT USES OF WATER WIRE WE NOW BEING TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE FIFTEEN PERCENT. OR TEN PERCENT WELL WE ALREADY ARE VERY LOW USERS OF WATER WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN ALL OF THE PLUMBING THAT WE CAN PUT IN. WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES IS IT MOVES THE STATE UP AWAY FROM THOSE ONE SIZE FITS ALL TYPES OF EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS THOSE ARBITRARY PERCENT INTRODUCTIONS THAT APPLY EQUALLY TO EVERYBODY NO MATTER HOW EFFICIENT YOU ARE? AND INSTEAD OF SETTING UP A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TYPE OF PROCESS IT LOOKS OUT LOCAL CONDITIONS AND ALLOWS FOR THOSE CONDITIONS TO HELP DICTATE HOW THOSE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES BECOME EFFICIENT. IT ALLOWS FOR A PROCESS WHERE THE WATER AGENCIES THEMSELVES COME UP WITH THE BREAST TYPE OF DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLANS THEY CAMPER THEIR CONDITIONS WITH OF COURSE NOW SOME MORE GUIDANCE AND APPROVAL FROM THE STATE'S A THAT THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT. EMPTY HANDED ANY LONGER. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS WITH A LOT OF COMPROMISES BELIEVE ME I'VE I HAVE GRAY HAIRS. FROM THESE BILLS FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF BUT THEY COME TO A REALLY GOOD PLACE HOW GOOD OF A PLACE IF THEY COME TO WE HAVE A. A LOT OF THE FORMER OPPONENTS OF THESE BILLS WHO ARE NOW SUPPORTERS VERY LARGE WATER AGENCIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE EAST BAY MUD METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT STE SFPUC IRVINE RANCH. ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT. CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION. IT'S A SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WESTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. OF GROUPS WHO WOULD WHO WOULD OPPOSE THIS BILL A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHO NOW SUPPORT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS. THE AMOUNT OF COMPROMISE AND THE AMOUNT OF TALKING THAT WENT INTO THIS LEGISLATION. WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK AS WE GO FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO DROUGHT BUT IT'S TIMEFOR US TO ACT AND TO DO SOMETHING. IS THIS GOING TO BE MAYBE THE PERFECT BILL FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU I WOULD SAY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO CRAFT A BILL THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IS GONNA THINK IS ALWAYS A HUNDRED PERCENT WONDERFUL. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE GONE FAR WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE HAVE BROUGHT PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE OPPONENTS TO NOW BE SUPPORTERS. THIS IS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THIS TAKES US NOW ON THE ROAD TO STATEWIDE WATER EFFICIENCY AND I WOULD URGE ALL OF YOU TO VOTE I TODAY. AND ALLOW THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA HERE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD ADD TO. THAT ARE CALLING HASN'T ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE UNDERGONE A. TREMENDOUS. RIGOROUS. AT SOMETIMES PAINFUL PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING WHAT'S ULTIMATELY BEFORE US TODAY. AND THE IT'S BEEN WHAT I WOULD CALL A PRETTY INCLUSIVE PROCESS TO SAY THE LEAST. A MANY. INDIVIDUALS FROM. THIS BODY. PARTICIPATED IN THE CONVERSATIONS. TO ULTIMATELY. SEE THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. A WE HAVE COME QUITE A BIT OF WAYS AS MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS MENTIONED. TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT BY A NUMBER OF WATER AGENCIES SMALL LARGE OF FROM UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IF SHIFTED THEIR POSITION. FROM MAY ADAM IN NO POSITION TWO NOW SUPPORTING. THIS POLICY I RESPECTFULLY ASK I ON THESE. POLICIES THAT ARE BEFORE US IS TAKING A LOT OF TIME AND WORK A TO COME BEFORE US LET ME JUST GO OVER A COUPLE OF THINGS. THAT ARE IN THIS BILL. INDOOR USE WERE ESTABLISHING WATER BUDGETS MADE UP RENDERS INDOOR USE OUTRIGHT USE INCLUDING INDUSTRY WHERE POSSIBLE. WATER LOSS PART ABORT REUSE WATER EXPANDS. THE BUDGET ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THAT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR WATER RIGHTS TO BE IMPACTED REQUIRED FORSMAN ON WATER SUPPLIERS CUSTOMERS. CHANGES AGRICULTURE WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS URBAN DROUGHT PLANNING AND RESPONSE AND ESTABLISHES ROLE DRAW PLANNING. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE THE END OF LAST YEAR THE CONVERSATIONS WHERE WE LEFT OFF WATER SUPPLIERS WITH EXISTING FACILITIES CAN NOW RECEIVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT PROBABLE REUSE. SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY CONTENTIOUS ARE ALONG THE WAY. CLARIFIES THAT THERE WILL BE APPROVED VARIANCES PROHIBITS THE WATER BOARD FROM REQUIRING WATER SUPPLIERS TO ISSUE FINES ON THEIR CUSTOMERS. SPECIFIES WHAT GOES INTO INDOOR WATER USE COMPONENT AND ALLOWS WATER SUPPLIERS. TO CHECK THE WORK THAT WENT INTO ESTABLISHING THE OUTDOOR COMPONENT THOSE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT MANY OF YOU BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AT THE END OF. LAST SESSION THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE REFLECTED IN THESE POLICIES. SO TODAY THAT'S BEFORE YOU. AND AS I MENTIONED THERE WAS A LOT OF DELIBERATION AND COMPROMISED THAT'S TAKEN PLACE A TO GET TO THIS POINT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IN APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE GLENDALE AREA AS WELL AS FROM THE. I BELIEVE IT'S THE. WELL WHEN PARK AREA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EXPECTED. ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED. IT'S RUBIO WE MAKE LOS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THERE IS A QUOTE IN THE WATER INDUSTRY THAT SAYS WITH USE FOR DRINKING WATERS FOR FIGHTING WELL I WOULD NOT. TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. BUT THE. PART OF THE COMPROMISE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN I GOT HERE PART OF THE. WORD COMPROMISE TO ME MEANT THAT NOT EVERYBODY GOT EVERYTHING AND BUT WE ALL GOT SOMETHING AND I THINK IT TOOK A YEAR AND A HALF FOR ALL OF US TO BE AT THIS POINT. IT TOOK A LOT OF. GIVING INTO THINGS THAT WE NEED MORE WEREN'T ABSOLUTELY. HAPPY WITH BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD POINT I'M AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT IF THERE IS ANOTHER DROUGHT WE WON'T HAVE ANY SAY SO THE GOVERNOR CAN ALWAYS. IMPOSE AN EMERGENCY AND HE OR SHE HAS CONTROL OF WHATEVER. STANDARDS THEY SAID AND SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND I HEAR MY COLLEAGUES. FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND I APPRECIATE THE EMPLOYED AND I THINK THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO AT LEAST. TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING I KNOW IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH YOU ON FUTURE WATER LEGISLATION I HOPE TO BE. AND STAY IN THE WATER COMMITTEE FOR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AGAIN I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER LEGISLATION THAT'S PASSED. IS NOT.

GOVERNOR DUKMAJIAN SHOULD ALSO BE REMEMBERED AS A TRUE GENTLEMAN. HE WAS ALWAYS POLITE AND A CLASS ACT. THE MAN DID NOT HAVE AN ARROGANT BONE IN HIS BODY. HE HAD TO CALM DEMEANOR THAT CARRIED RESPECT. HE WAS MODEST AS WELL HE STILL LIVE IN THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE RAISED HIS KIDS AND WAS HIS HOME PRIOR TO BEING THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN IS POLICY ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE MANY. HE WAS AN ARDENT FISCAL CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE AND KNEW THAT A GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE LIVES AND DIES BY ITS BUDGET.

THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I STAND IN HONOR OF A GREAT CALIFORNIAN AND A GREAT ARMENIAN AMERICAN GOVERNOR GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN. EQUATION WAS A DEDICATED AN EXCEPTIONAL PUBLIC SERVANT COMMITTED TO PROTECTING. THE PUBLIC SAFETY. I VALUED HIS PASSION FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AND THE HE WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAPED BY THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND THAT'S WHY YOU COULD SEE HIS APPEARANCE. TO THE RULE OF LAW. HIS AUNT WAS KILLED BY OTTOMAN TURKS IN THE GENOCIDE AND HIS. PARENTS FLED FOR AMERICA. ALL ARMENIANS FROM A YOUNG AGE ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THE GENOCIDE. AND THERE WE ARE TAUGHT NOT ONLY TO REMEMBER BUT TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. BECAUSE OF OUR ANCESTORS EXPERIENCE. GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN INTERNALIZE THESE LESSONS. ONE OF HIS MOST SURPRISING MOVES WITH HIS EVENTUAL SUPPORT OF THE DIVESTMENT OF THE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS TEACHER AN EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUNDS. FROM FIRMS THAT DID BUSINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA. UPON HEARING NEWS OF THE SOUTH AFRICA THAT SOUTH AFRICA WAS HUNTING DOWN AND JAILING ANTI APARTHEID ACTIVISTS HE RALLIED HIS OWN APPOINTEES TO SUPPORT DIVESTMENT. GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN. WOULD NOT USE CALIFORNIA'S MASSIVE RETIREMENT FUNDS TO SUPPORT AN UNJUST REGIME. WHETHER YOU AGREED OR DISAGREED WITH HIM ON POLICY ISSUES. BY ALL ACCOUNTS HE WAS AN HONEST PASSIONATE PERSON. SERVED WITH GREAT INTEGRITY. A PRAGMATIST AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE. THE GOVERNOR ASSIGNED AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AFTER A MASS SHOOTING. WE SHOULD REMEMBER HIM AS SOMEONE WILLING TO PLACE COULD POLICY AHEAD OF IDEOLOGY. AND THE GOVERNOR WILLING TO WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES. AS IN ARMENIAN. THE WAS A ROLE MODEL. FOR THE COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY LEFT WITH A MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT FROM THE GENOCIDE. OF TWO LIVES UNDER COMMUNISM AND TO THE DIASPORA EXPERIENCE AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO WAS INSPIRED. TO PURSUE PUBLIC. PUBLIC OFFICE BECAUSE IDEA AYE LOOKING AT HIM REALIZE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO ALSO BE AN OFFICE. HE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF ARMENIANS INTO PUBLIC SERVICE AND I THINK IN FOR HIS COURAGE. HONESTY AND PASSION MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HIS WIFE GLORIA CHILDREN AND LOVED ONES THANK YOU. THE COMMISSION IS AREA MISTER ALLEN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT LOOKS RISE IN HONOR. OF GEORGE MAGE ALSO KNOWN AS THE IRON DUKE. THE THIRTY FIFTH GOVERNOR'S IN CALIFORNIA.

DEGRADED WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO WIN ALL OF THE POLLS ACTUALLY HAD HIM DOWN AND HAD HIM IS LOSING. EVEN THE EXIT POLLS THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION SHOWED HIM LOSING. BUT HE WAS VICTORIOUS IN WHEN HE WON. HE FOUGHT AGAINST TAX INCREASE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HE WAS KNOWN AS THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE. HE WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE ALSO THAT ENSURED THAT WE HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY HEARING CALIFORNIA. HE WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE COURTS ARE HIGHLY CRITICAL OF JERRY BROWN'S APPOINTMENTS I TO THE SUPREME COURT SPECIFICALLY ROSE BIRD WHO WAS RELATOR REMOVED FROM OFFICE BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

FROM HIS SERVICE HIS CHARACTER AND GOVERNING STYLE REPRESENTED THE GOOD. IN AMERICAN POLITICS AND I THINK WE COULD SEE THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS THAT ROSE TO JOIN IN HIS MEMORY. TODAY. HE WAS A PRINCIPAL CONSERVATIVE THAT MUCH LIKE REAGAN BELIEVES. I KNOW YOU KNEW. THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM IN THE TENT FOR EVERYONE. HE REPRESENTED US ALL WITH POLICIES THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST. MANY RECALL GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN IS DISCRETE DEMEANOR. A STARK CONTRAST WITH TODAY'S SHOUTING THAT OCCURS. ON CABLE NEWS AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IT WAS THROUGH HIS QUIET LEADERSHIP THAT THE BIG FIVE WAS CREATED IN FOR THE PATH FOR MUTUAL RESPECT. ACROSS PARTY LEADERSHIP. HIS PASSING LEAVES A VOID IN CALIFORNIA POLITICS ONE THAT I HOPE WILL BE FILLED. IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. MY HOPE EXTENDS THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS THOSE OF US HERE. IN THIS CHAMBER.
