SAID AND THEN ALICE'S REITERATES

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.317
BOTH BECAUSE THESE LAWS ARE

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.818
PENAL IN NATURE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.920

STANDING THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:02.024

LAWCENTER BOX THAT WOULD DO THIS

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.731
IN OUR OWN STATE BETTER K. STATE

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.667

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:12.635
RESULT WE DO NOT NEED TO ENFORCE

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.470
THOSE IN OTHER STATES. I WOULD

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.738
LIKE TO CORRECT THE RECORD ON

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.573
ONE THING THAT WAS SAID BY THE

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.575
OPPOSITION AS A LONGTIME ALLY OF

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:20.543
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY I WANT TO BE

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.912
CLEAR THAT WHEN SOME STATES DID

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:23.813
ALLOW FOR GAY MARRIAGE. THOSE

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:24.747

THOSE MARRIAGES AND OTHER STATES

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.485
AND I DON'T WANT THE RECORD OF

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.620
HISTORY TO BE UNCLEAR ON THAT

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:32.655
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:33.522
AS THE SISTER OF SOMEONE WHO IS

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.991

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:32.761
PRACTICE THAT GOES AGAINST THE

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.796
STATED GOAL. OF REUNIFYING

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.831
FAMILIES CALIFORNIA DATA SHOWS

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:37.632
THAT MANY PARENTS ARE REQUIRED

TO PAY THESE EXPENSES.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.802
EXPERIENCE EXTREME POVERTY. THE

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.717
TO DO JUST THAT. REUNIFY IT ALSO

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.386
HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT.

01:20:58.453 --> 01:20:59.554
ON BLACK BROWN POINT INDIGENOUS

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.256
