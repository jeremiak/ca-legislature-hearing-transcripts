IF THE LAWS HAVE NO TEETH TO

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.199
THEM IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.368

THIS BILL LET ME JUST RESPOND A

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:32.788
FEW THINGS THAT ARE FOR FROM

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:35.190
THE UC- FIRST OF ALL THEY

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.625
WONDER WHY IT APPLIES TO THEM

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.994
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.129
IF THERE'S A FUTURE BILL THAT

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:41.930
WOULD APPLY TO MORE LOCAL

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:43.899
JURISDICTIONS OR OTHER PUBLIC

THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:47.603
SUPPORT BUT THE REALITY IS IN

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.972
RECENT YEARS THE UC HAS BEEN

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.940
THE MOST EGREGIOUS VIOLATOR. OF

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.575
IN THIS AREA AND DESPITE

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.777
WARNINGS AND PROMISES TO DO

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.178
BETTER THEY'VE CONTINUED TO

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:59.448
FLAUNT THE LAW AND AS- ARE

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.518
ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE- DOLLARS

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:05.054
COMES REYES JUST MENTION- AT

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:05.854
THIS MOMENT THERE'S REALLY NO

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.524
TEETH- EVEN IF THE EMPLOYER

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.591
ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.727
SUCCESSFUL AND PETITION PER TO

TIME THAT NOTICE THE DAMAGE HAS

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.368
BEEN DONE AND SO WE THINK THAT

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.803
THERE MAY BE JUST A LITTLE BIT

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:23.205
AS PARTY FROM I ALSO WANT TO

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.106

SUCCESSFUL. AND AS A RESULT OF

02:21:34.118 --> 02:21:36.254
THAT THEY HAVE DEVISED. WAYS TO

02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:37.121
TRY TO GET A DIVERSE STUDENT

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:39.557
POPULATION. WE STILL LAG BEHIND

02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:40.592
IN SOME AREAS IN TERMS OF THE

02:21:40.658 --> 02:21:42.627
POPULATION. BUT THEY WORK VERY

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:44.062
HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY TRY TO

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:45.163
GET FOLKS IN BUT ASIANS ARE

02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:46.865
NOT. FED NOT BENEFITING FROM

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:48.800
PROP TWO OH NINE. THEN I

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:49.300
BENEFITING IN TERMS OF

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:51.703
BUSINESSES AND CONTRACTING. NOT

02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:53.171
NOT NOT BENEFITING IN TERMS OF

02:21:53.238 --> 02:21:55.073
SCHOOL IN MOBILE. AND SO- AS A

02:21:55.139 --> 02:21:57.175
RESULT WHEN WE HAD AFFIRMATIVE

02:21:57.242 --> 02:21:58.343
ACTION AND THAT'S AN EFFORT TO

02:21:58.409 --> 02:22:00.411
BE. SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT AT

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:01.646
LEAST OF AFFIRMATIVE EFFORT TO

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:03.214
INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS IS NOT A

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:04.749
QUOTA. IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED.

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:06.584
UP AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:08.353
STATE STANDARDS THERE WERE

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:10.054
GREATER IN MOMENTS OF ASIANS

02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:14.492
LATINOS. AND AFRICAN AMERICANS.

02:22:14.559 --> 02:22:15.827
VERSUS WHAT WAS AS WELL AS THE

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:16.594
REGULAR STUDENTS THE OF THE

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.263
OTHER. THAT WOULD THERE. SO

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:20.331
THEY STILL THERE'S- A CONCEPT

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:21.266
THE THIS IS TO HAPPEN AT. OF

02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:22.934
AND YET WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THE-

02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:23.968
THE AGENTS FOR AFFIRMATIVE

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:25.570
ACTION AND A HOST OF OTHER

02:22:25.637 --> 02:22:26.905
ORGANIZATIONS TO DRILL DOWN TO

02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:28.373
THE DATA. MATERIAL WE'VE GIVEN

02:22:28.439 --> 02:22:30.141
THEM. IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:31.743
THAT THERE IS NO NEGATIVE THAT

02:22:31.809 --> 02:22:33.544
COMES TO ASIAN POPULATIONS. AS

02:22:33.611 --> 02:22:35.013
A RESULT OF IT. AFRICAN

02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:36.514
AMERICANS FIGHT HARD FOR THIS

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:37.682
PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY WITH

02:22:37.749 --> 02:22:38.950
BERMAN OF ACTION. AND

02:22:39.017 --> 02:22:40.018
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WE ARE THE

02:22:40.084 --> 02:22:41.653
LEAST TO PERMANENT BENEFIT FROM

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:43.254
IT. IN TERMS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:44.322
THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION.

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:46.391
YET WE FIGHT FOR IT. BECAUSE WE

02:22:46.457 --> 02:22:47.525
KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WE KNOW

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:48.626
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:50.929
HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:52.397
TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MOST OF YOU

02:22:52.463 --> 02:22:53.798

TALKING BACK PULL BUT NOW. THE

02:22:57.001 --> 02:22:58.036
GROUPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.804
DEVASTATED BY COLE WAS AT BUT

02:22:59.871 --> 02:23:01.239
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN. AT THE

02:23:01.306 --> 02:23:02.473
IMPACT OF IT IN TERMS OF

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.542
HEALTH. ECONOMICS ALL OF THOSE

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.110
THINGS IT EDUCATION. OUR

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:07.946
CHILDREN WHO ARE WHO ARE STILL

02:23:08.012 --> 02:23:09.247
SUFFERING WILL HAVE WITH GREAT

02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:10.548
OF LOSS AS A RESULT OF WHAT

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:12.050
WHAT'S GOING ON. IN FEW

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:13.851
RESOURCES TO REBUILD. OUR

02:23:13.918 --> 02:23:15.253
BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:16.354
DECIMATED BECAUSE I PEOPLE OF

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:17.322

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:19.123
BANKS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.925
STABILIZE OUR BUSINESSES. AND

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:21.826
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

02:23:21.893 --> 02:23:24.028
BUT BUSINESS YOU IT'S DIFFICULT

02:23:24.095 --> 02:23:25.330
TO STABILIZE A BUSINESS. SO

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.631
WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT IT

02:23:26.698 --> 02:23:27.665
AND SOME SAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO

02:23:27.732 --> 02:23:29.500
THIS BECAUSE OF COLD BUT- WE

02:23:29.567 --> 02:23:30.902

02:23:30.969 --> 02:23:32.303
THE RESULT OF IT AND WITHOUT

BUSINESSES WILL NOT COME BACK.

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:40.745
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:41.713
THAT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT IN

02:23:41.779 --> 02:23:42.714
BOSTON THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.682
DOING SOME AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:45.216

AMERICANS OUT OF WORK. WE NEED

THE LAST TWO MONTHS. THIS IS

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:10.514
GONNA AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE IN

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:13.184
OUR HOMES. I THINK WE IN THE

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:14.285
LEGISLATURE BEFORE THIS YEAR IS

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:17.121
DONE. NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:18.623
FACT THAT IT'S LIKE CANCER

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:22.059
TREATMENT. TRONG MEDICINE WHICH

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:25.162
DEALS WITH CANCER CAN SOMETIMES

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:25.730
HAVE OTHER EFFECTS THAT NEED

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:28.599
REMEDIATION. SO I SORT OF FEEL

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:31.002
THIS TIME OF DOWNTURN. THE

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.570
LEGISLATURE NEEDS LOOK ACROSS A

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:34.272
BROAD ECONOMY IS A ONE OF THE

02:28:34.338 --> 02:28:36.540
THINGS WE NEED TO DO. TO

02:28:36.607 --> 02:28:38.042
STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA AS A

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:41.445
WHOLE. BUT WE HAVE TIME TO DO

02:28:41.512 --> 02:28:42.513
THAT I THINK WAS TRYING TO GET

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:45.116
A FOCUS ON THAT- MY COLLEAGUE

02:28:45.182 --> 02:28:45.783
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:47.385

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:56.193
ANALYSTS TO JUDY TO FOCUS ON

02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.562
WHAT DO WE DO FOR THE ENTIRETY

02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:02.166
OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS MEASURE

02:29:02.233 --> 02:29:04.802
FOLKS ARE VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM

02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:07.038
OF HOW DO WE GIVE HOPE. TO

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:10.641
FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T HAD. THE AND

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:13.377
OF MY COLLEAGUE- MISTER VOEPEL

02:29:13.444 --> 02:29:14.612

THOSE CONVERSATIONS ONE IS OUT

02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:23.587

CHAPTER SIX VERSE TO SIX AND

02:29:25.489 --> 02:29:27.591
NINE SAYS DO NOT GROW WEARY IN

HAVE OPPORTUNITY LET US DO GOOD

02:29:32.063 --> 02:29:34.465
TO ALL PEOPLE. I SORT OF THINK

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:35.666
THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ETHIC

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:36.567
THAT WE OUGHT TO BE AS

02:29:36.634 --> 02:29:38.469

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:42.373
GROW WEARY IN WELL DOING. ANY

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.008
OTHER ONE THAT CAME TO MIND

02:29:44.075 --> 02:29:46.077
ACTUALLY REFLECTED UPON THIS.

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:48.813
IS THE FUNNY LITTLE BOOK AN ILL

02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:50.881
TEST OF THE BOOK OF JONAH. JOHN

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:51.982
WHO SENT ON A MISSION TO GO

02:29:52.049 --> 02:29:53.517
TELL SOME PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE

02:29:53.584 --> 02:29:55.286
GOING TO BE JUDGED. HE DOESN'T

02:29:55.353 --> 02:29:56.821
EVENTUALLY AFTER A LOT OF.

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:58.789
ADVENTURE MARITIME ADVENTURE I

02:29:58.856 --> 02:30:01.158
SAY AS I LOOK AND- THERE'S NO

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:03.627
VOEPEL OVER THERE. BUT AT THE

02:30:03.694 --> 02:30:05.730
VERY END HE CERTAIN OUTSIDE THE

02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:09.567
CITY. AND HE'S UNHAPPY BECAUSE

02:30:09.633 --> 02:30:10.034
IT DOES NOT GENERALLY

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:12.870
COMPASSION. AND A PLANT GROWS

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:16.674
UP. SHELTERS HIM FROM THE HEAT

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:18.709
THEN THE PLANT DIES WHAT YOU

02:30:18.776 --> 02:30:19.977
REALLY SEE IS THIS BOOK IS

02:30:20.044 --> 02:30:21.345
ABOUT HOW DO YOU GROW

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:24.815
COMPASSION. AND THE PUNCH LINE

02:30:24.882 --> 02:30:26.851
OF THE BOOK OF JONAH SOMETIMES

02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:28.519
WE ARE MORE COMPASSIONATE.

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:30.254
WE'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SOME

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:33.124
HARDSHIP OURSELVES. JOHN IS ALL

02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:35.126
ABOUT HOW JOHN HAD AN ATTITUDE

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:38.396
CHANGE HAVING HAD A GOOD THING

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.898
THE KIND OF DRIFTED AWAY. SO I

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.266

WE'VE JUST COMPLETED AND THEN A

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:32.228
PARTIAL OF KINDA LIKE A FAKE

FAKE HERE TRUST ME. AND THEN.

02:49:38.902 --> 02:49:40.770
IT RATCHETED DOWN IT'S ALMOST

02:49:40.837 --> 02:49:42.338
LIKE AN AIRCRAFT THAT HAS

02:49:42.405 --> 02:49:45.808
ENGINE FAILURE. THE INVESTMENTS

02:49:45.875 --> 02:49:48.044

AND YOU GO DOWN A DID. AND WHAT

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:03.126
HAPPENS IS CAPITALIST SUCKED IN

02:50:03.192 --> 02:50:03.693
AIR AND WHERE I'M GOING WITH

02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.231
THIS. IS STIRS EMPERORS HAVE

02:50:08.298 --> 02:50:10.133
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR

02:50:10.199 --> 02:50:14.370
FUNDIE. AND AS THE TAX BASE

02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:17.473
EVAPORATES. THAT MEANS THE

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:20.209
CITIES AND ALL THE PARTICIPANTS

02:50:20.276 --> 02:50:22.745
OF HERS. ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN

02:50:22.812 --> 02:50:26.215
DEEP TROUBLE. ASSEMBLY

02:50:26.282 --> 02:50:27.850
FINANCING THE WHOLE YSTEM

02:50:27.917 --> 02:50:30.320
WITHOUT A STOCK MARKET CRASH

02:50:30.386 --> 02:50:31.988
INTO ECONOMIC CONTRACTION

02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:33.890
MISTER CHAIR. WITH ALL DUE

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:34.991
RESPECT IT'S NOW IT'S OUTSIDE

02:50:35.058 --> 02:50:36.759
THE PENSIONS THIS BILL SPEAKS

02:50:36.826 --> 02:50:37.694
TO EFFORTS OUTSIDE THE PENSION

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:39.228
SYSTEM I THINK THIS ANSWER

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:40.463
STANDARDS GOING EVERY AS A

02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:41.598
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JUST

02:50:41.664 --> 02:50:44.601
ONE ORDER I THINK HE'S SPEAKING

02:50:44.667 --> 02:50:45.234
TO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT REALLY.

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.437
IT DOESN'T COMPORT WITH A BILL.

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:48.705
GREGORY JUST STICK TO THE

02:50:48.771 --> 02:50:50.573
MERITS OF THE BILL QUESTION

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.742
WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS.

02:50:52.809 --> 02:50:55.878
FROM STIRS VIEWPOINT. THIS IS

02:50:55.945 --> 02:50:57.880
THE WORST POSSIBLE TIMING FOR

02:50:57.947 --> 02:51:00.617
THIS BILL I WOULD NOT BE

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.986
NECESSARILY AGAINST IT. IN A

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:04.520
COUPLE YEARS WHEN WE SEE WHAT

02:51:04.587 --> 02:51:06.422
THE ECONOMY'S GOING TO TURN OUT

02:51:06.489 --> 02:51:07.590
TO BE AND WHAT ARE FUNDING IS

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:09.158
GOING TO BE BUT STARS HAS

02:51:09.225 --> 02:51:11.294
PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PORTFOLIO

02:51:11.361 --> 02:51:14.330
ANYWAY. ADDING ON AN IRATE

02:51:14.397 --> 02:51:16.032
MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE TO ME

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:18.868
RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE ALSO.

02:51:18.935 --> 02:51:20.903
COMPETING ONCE AGAIN WITH THE

02:51:20.970 --> 02:51:24.073
PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S MY POINT.

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.808
THANK ANY OTHER CUSTOMER IF I

02:51:25.875 --> 02:51:27.577
COULD RESPOND OF THAT CHURCH

02:51:27.644 --> 02:51:28.645
REAL QUICK NORTH OKAY WHAT

02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:30.246
EXACTLY THE POINT OF EDUCATION

02:51:30.313 --> 02:51:33.883
IS VOEPEL BUT I THINK WHAT THIS

02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:34.350
BILL DOES IS ACTUALLY

02:51:34.417 --> 02:51:35.251
CONTEMPLATES. THAT THE PENSION

02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:36.653
SYSTEM CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:51:36.719 --> 02:51:38.755
ALL OF ALL ITS MEMBERS BECAUSE-

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:40.356
YOU'LL GET YOURS ACTUALLY THE

02:51:40.423 --> 02:51:41.624
PENSION TEACHERS GET IS.

02:51:41.691 --> 02:51:43.459
ACTUALLY NOT A LOT WHEN

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:44.060
COMPARED TO SOME OTHER PENSION

02:51:44.127 --> 02:51:46.195
SYSTEMS OUT THERE- SO WHAT

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:47.330
WE'RE ENCOURAGING TEACHERS TO

02:51:47.397 --> 02:51:49.799
DO IS PUT MONEY ASIDE. AND

02:51:49.866 --> 02:51:51.534
RECOGNIZE THE FACT. THAT

02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:52.702
WHETHER PENSION SYSTEM HELL

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:53.403
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:51:53.469 --> 02:51:54.771
NEED MORE MONEY THAN THE

02:51:54.837 --> 02:51:56.539
PENSION SYSTEM IS OBLIGATED TO

02:51:56.606 --> 02:51:58.374
GIVE THEM. TO SURVIVE GOING

02:51:58.441 --> 02:51:59.942
FORWARD. SO AS A LONGTIME

02:52:00.009 --> 02:52:01.878
TEACHER MYSELF NO I STARTED

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:04.013
EARLY ON. YOU KNOW SAVING

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:05.348
OUTSIDE MY PENSION SYSTEM

02:52:05.415 --> 02:52:06.949
BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED THAT THAT

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:08.951
PENSION SYSTEM WASN'T. CARRY ME

02:52:09.018 --> 02:52:10.053
THROUGH AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE

02:52:10.119 --> 02:52:11.020
THAT GEE I'M NOT GONNA GET

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:11.788
SOCIAL SECURITY AND I'VE

02:52:11.854 --> 02:52:13.656
WORKED. MANY YEARS AND YET

02:52:13.723 --> 02:52:15.191
WON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF

02:52:15.258 --> 02:52:16.192
SECURITIES ALL THE MONEY THAT

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:18.161
I. PUT INTO STILL SECURITY I

02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:20.863
GAVE AWAY BUT I THINK. THE GOAL

02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:22.932
HERE IS TO GET TEACHERS TO SAVE

02:52:22.999 --> 02:52:24.033
MONEY SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:27.036
GOAL. NOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS-

02:52:27.103 --> 02:52:28.805
WORD. THERE IS SHOULD SHOULD

02:52:28.871 --> 02:52:30.373
THE ON THE IRA IRA BUSINESS WE

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:31.407
CAN WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE ALL

02:52:31.474 --> 02:52:33.276
DAY LONG. BUT THERE WAS A

02:52:33.342 --> 02:52:34.510
CONCERN BROUGHT ABOUT CONFUSION

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:36.646
WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO NEED

02:52:36.713 --> 02:52:37.513
TO BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD.

02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:38.715
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TEACHERS

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:39.682
THINKING THAT THEY SHOULD DO IS

02:52:39.749 --> 02:52:41.384
JUST GOING TO I'M GOING TO GO.

02:52:41.451 --> 02:52:43.319
OPEN IRATE WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT

02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:43.853
BE AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD

02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:46.789
PROBABLY. GO THE FOUR THREE B.

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:48.725
ROUTE FIRST BECAUSE THAT CAPITA

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:50.426
MUCH HIGHER THAN THE IRA CAP.

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:53.296
RIGHT AND ALSO SOME OF THE

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:55.031
OFFERINGS THAT WE IF TO STARS

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:57.934
AS GOING TO GOING TO THE SERENE

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:58.534
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE-

02:52:58.601 --> 02:52:59.168
AT THOSE PRODUCTS THEY DO OFFER

02:52:59.235 --> 02:53:01.637
OUR COMPETITIVE. WHEN I FIRST

02:53:01.704 --> 02:53:02.972
WENT INTO TEACHING BASICALLY

02:53:03.039 --> 02:53:03.773
ALL YOU CAN GET WAS AN ANNUITY.

02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:07.110
RIGHT AND THAT PROBABLY AT THE

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:08.711
AGE MY WAS THAT PROBABLY WASN'T

02:53:08.778 --> 02:53:09.879
THE BEST VEHICLE INVESTMENT

02:53:09.946 --> 02:53:11.114
VEHICLE FOR ME AT THAT POINT IN

02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:12.248
MY LIFE IT MAY BE IN A GOOD

02:53:12.315 --> 02:53:14.183
INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR PEOPLE

02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:15.151
ANOTHER DIFFERENT POINTS TO

02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:15.885
LIVE THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND IT

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:17.887
WAS NOW MORE SO THAN WHAT THAN

02:53:17.954 --> 02:53:19.622
THEIR THEIR WORK BACK IN BUT

02:53:19.689 --> 02:53:20.556
AGAIN I'D SO THERE ARE SOME

02:53:20.623 --> 02:53:21.491
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

02:53:21.557 --> 02:53:23.826
CONTEMPLATED AS THE BILL MOVES

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:24.427
FORWARD. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR

02:53:24.494 --> 02:53:26.963

PENSION THAT HE RECEIVED I

02:53:40.576 --> 02:53:41.043
THINK IS WONDERFUL BUT IT

02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:42.311
WASN'T ENOUGH YOU'RE RIGHT

02:53:42.378 --> 02:53:44.547
SAVING ON THAT IN ADDITION TO
