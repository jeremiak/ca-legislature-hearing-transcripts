BEGAN MY CAREER AND I SOLVE PRE

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.104
DHAKA THE EFFECT THAT NOT HAVING

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.026
A SHAME FOR CALIFORNIA NOT TO BE

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:00.798
IT INDICATES IN THE ANALYSIS OF

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:02.300
ONLY ELEVEN OF THE HUNDRED

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.001
FOURTEEN CAMPUSES HAVE FEES NOW.

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:05.870
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE -- PUT

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.972
FEES ON THE BALLOT AND THEY HAVE

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.942
FAILED.

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.443
SO NO SO THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.879
IS LIKE A RIGOROUS -- SO IT HAS

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:15.513
TO BE.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.082
PUT ON THE BALLOT ED EACH ASL

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:19.484

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.185
PROCESS FOR WHAT CAN GO ON A

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:23.488
BALLOT AND IN THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:25.857
BE THE AVERAGE OF THE PAST THREE

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:27.258
ELECTIONS AND HAS THE BEST RATE

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.960
WAS SO MOST IS OLDER LIKE THAT'S

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.394
TOO MUCH WORK AND SO IT DOESN'T

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.029
THEY DON'T BOTHER PUT IT ON IT

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:32.530
BECAUSE I MEAN.

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:34.065
THAT STUDENTS ON TOP OF

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.433
SOMETHING ELSE ON TOP OF

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.068
SOMETHING ELSE SO A LOT OF A

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.904
ESOS JUST DIDN'T GO THROUGH WITH

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.974
IT CLARIFIED THAT'S YOU SO

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.442
SHOULD STUDENTS.

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:47.044
EACH INDIVIDUAL CHANGE AND I WAS

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:48.179
THE NUMBERS IN THE IN THE IN THE

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:48.913
LETTERS TO CHANGE.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.848
SO I I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- I

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.850
FIND THIS A REQUIREMENTS I GUESS

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.619
IT'S A STATE REQUIREMENT OF THE

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.687
AVERAGE OF THREE ELECTIONS. TO

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:57.688
BE RIDICULOUS.

00:35:57.755 --> 00:36:03.895
I MEAN THINK OF WE DID THAT FOR

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:04.896
OUR ELECTIONS OKAY -- IN THE

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:05.796
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN TWO

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:06.464
THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT SOME WOULD

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:07.565
SAY WAS VERY CONSEQUENTIAL 60%

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:08.966
OF AMERICANS DIDN'T VOTE.

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.268
AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR SENATE

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:11.969
ELECTIONS YESTERDAY.

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:14.005
MY GUESS IS THE TURNOUT IN THOSE

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:14.572
ELECTIONS WOULD NEVER HAVE

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.240

AND SOMEONE A FLAG THAT IS WHAT

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.445
I THINK IS AN UNFAIR.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:24.081
REQUIREMENT TO CREATE A EVEN

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.583

END THE COLLEGE -- I'M RETIRED

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.254
NOW BUT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:17.888
ISSUE OVER MANY YEARS -- IT WAS

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:18.555
MY DISTRICT THAT HAD SOME

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.089
TROUBLE.

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.590
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO -- THAT WE

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.258
WENT TO FACT WITH WHERE THE

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.392
DISTRICT DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT --

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:23.994
TRANSFER OF SICKLY FROM A PART

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.329
TIME FACULTY MEMBER.

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:26.463
AND AT THAT POINT -- K. TWELVE

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.798
AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAD

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.333
THE SAME AD CODE LANGUAGE.

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:30.801
OKAY CALLS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:31.702
WORLD FROM THE COMMUNITY

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.338
COLLEGES IT WAS A YOUNG ONE YEAR

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.640
ANDMOST K. TWELVE JOBS YOU KNOW

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:37.974
OUR FULL TIME.

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.609
AND YOU OF WOULD TRANSFER

00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:41.645
COMPLETELY FROM ONE DISTRICT TO

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.747
ANOTHER -- AND WE SHALL AND AND

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.248
WITHIN A YEAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.883
TRANSFER YOUR SICK LEAVE AND NOT

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.518
STILL IS THE WAY IT IS FOR K..

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.220
TWELVE BUT OUR PART TIME FACULTY

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:51.955
OF A HARD TIME WITH THAT --

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.090
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FULL

00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:55.125
TIME JOBS AND A TRAVEL AMONG

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.027
MANY DISTRICTS OFTEN.

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:59.096
AND FRANKLY NEVER REALLY KNOW

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.864
WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER HIRED IN

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.899
A DISTRICT OR WHEN THEY AT WORK

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:04.000
WHEN THEY REALLY COMPLETELY

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:04.501
TERMINATED.

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:05.402
THEY COULD MAYBE NOT AN

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.138
pSUDDENLY BE CALLED BACK IF

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.706
THERE'S A NEED BECAUSE THEIR

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.108
NAME IS STILL IN THE POOL.

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:13.210
SO THE WE WERE HOPING TO GET --

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:15.712
A MORE REASONABLE TIME LIMIT --

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.415
WE WERE -- WORKING TOWARD A FIVE

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.417
YEAR LIMIT WITH -- ARE

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.386
LEGISLATION AT THAT TIME.

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:25.222
AND ENDED UP WITH A THREE AND SO.

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.723
THE IDEA ABOUT THAT SORT OF A

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.824
TIME LIMIT WAS THAT IF THERE

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.426
WERE REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ON A

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.094
CAMPUS FOR A PART TIME FACULTY

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:31.995
MEMBER.

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.830
THAT BY FIVE YEARS THAT THEY

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:34.731
DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE LOST THEM

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.333
IF THEY HAD NOT HAD CONTINUOUS

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.535
SERVICE. THREE MAYBE THAT'S A

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:42.773
LITTLE DICEY -- BUT THAT'S WHAT

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:43.340
WE ENDED UP WITH.

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.474
SINCE THAT TIME.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.108
DISTRICT SEVEN TO REPORTED THIS

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.042
LAW.

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:47.611
IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:49.212
STILL DENYING TRANSFER OF SICK

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:49.780
LEAVE UNDER CERTAIN

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:51.648
CIRCUMSTANCES SOME HOLD TO A

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:54.418
HARD A THREE YEAR RULE OTHERS

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:55.886
THINK THAT NO THAT'S REALLY AS

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:56.887
LONG AS YOU'RE STILL STILL

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:58.088
WORKING AT THERE'S NO BREAK IN

00:50:58.155 --> 00:50:59.222
SERVICE.

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:01.825
IN THE SYSTEM YOU YOU'RE OKAY SO

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:04.161
WE NEEDED TO JUST CLEAR THIS UP.

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.863
OF THE BOTTOM LINE ON THIS IS HE

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.964
HAD WITH CAL STIRS IS THAT.

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:10.233
WHEN YOU RETIRE AND EVEN WHILE

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.468
YOU'RE STILL WORKING SICKLY Và

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.370
SOMETHING YOU EARN IT'S A AND IT

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.771
DOES END UP IN RETIREMENT

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.339
POTENTIALLY BEING A BENEFIT --

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.141
WHERE YOU GET SOME SERVICE

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:18.742
CREDIT FOR YOUR UNUSED SICK

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.110
LEAVE?

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.878
SO -- REALLY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:24.047
PART TIME FACULTY -- WE WANTED

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.682
TO PRESS FOR ELIMINATING ANY

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.651
TIME LIMIT -- AND I'VE EXPLAINED

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.419
WHY THAT IS THEY JUST NEVER KNOW

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.887
REALLY WHEN THEY'VE TERMINATED

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:32.923
WITH ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICT.

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.324
SO -- THE ONLY THING OTHER THING

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:36.226
I WOULD ADD IS THAT BACK -- WHEN

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.994
WE WERE DOING THE EARLIER BILL

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.029
AT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.664
IT WAS THAT DISTRICTS DON'T KEEP

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.965
THESE RECORDS?

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:44.367
BUT IN MY RETIREMENT I WENT TO

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.069
ALL THE DISTRICTS I HAD WORKED

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.504
