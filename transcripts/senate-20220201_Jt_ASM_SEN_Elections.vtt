00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:11.235
STRONGLY THAT- THE UNIQUE THING

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.736
OF CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE THE

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:15.005

THOSE KINDS OF THINGS MAKERS

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.883
WANT TO AT LEAST LOOK AT IT AND

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.151
TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:28.652
THINK ARE SOME ISSUES THAT

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:31.021
CONTINUE TO- MAKE THE RECALL

ISSUES- REFORM ACT AS IS A PART

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:55.572
OF ANY OF THE RECALL PROCESS

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:58.809
SHOULD CONSIDER. THE IMPACT ON

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.110
AN OVERALL VOTER ON OVERALL

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.612
VOTER PARTICIPATION.

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.080
SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE SOME

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:04.581
IDEAS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.383
TERMS OF THE REFORM THAT'S THERE

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.818
BUT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:09.152
THE FACT THAT WHATEVER WE DO

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:12.089
WILL HAVE A- POSITIVE EFFECT. ON

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:14.291
IT AND EVERY ISSUE YOU HAS ALL

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:15.859
THE ISSUES THAT BECAUSE IT'S A

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:17.761
NOT TO BE AS EFFECTIVE. AND AS A

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:18.962
RESULT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:20.864
OUT- BUT IT'S CLEAR UP FROM

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.000
ACROSS THE BOARD ITSELF HAD SOME

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.101
ISSUES WITH THE RECALL. THAT

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.869
THEY FELT COULD BE IMPROVED

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.504
COULD BE TWEAKED AND WANT TO

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.172
LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.008
THE GENERAL PUBLIC- ONE OF THE

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.309
MAJOR CONCERNS AS YOU PROBABLY

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.677
PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE DID NOT

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.112
THINK THAT WE SHOULD SPLIT THE

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.648
ISSUE. BETWEEN THE NO VOTE FOR A

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.349
RECALL AND THE END OF THE

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:40.684
SITTING OF THE ISSUE AND A YES

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:42.653
VOTE WILL CONTENDERS. THAT IN

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:44.121
ITSELF PROBABLY CREATED MORE

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:46.256
CONFUSION WITH INDIVIDUALS- THE

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:47.991
MINIMUM CONFUSION AROUND THE

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.493
PRIMARY QUESTION OF SUBJECT OF

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:50.661
THE RECALL AND THE

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.162
QUALIFICATIONS AND THE MOTORS OF

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.598
REPLACEMENT. I HAD A TENDENCY TO

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:55.732
OVERSHADOW WHAT THE RECALL WAS

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.901
REALLY ALL ABOUT. AND IT IS

00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.102
ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT AN

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.171
ADDITIONAL ELECTION TAKING PLACE

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:02.906
IF WE DO WORK TO HAVE MORE THAN

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:04.174
ONE. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.776
GOOD PRETTY CLEAR THAT MOST

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:07.277
FOLKS THOUGHT THAT THE- UP AND-

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:10.013
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO VOTE- FOR

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.081
ONE THING AND THEN TO VOTE FOR

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:12.082
THE OTHER THING WOULD SUCH A

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.850
HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RUNNING.

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:15.285
AND THEN FEELING AT THE SAME

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:23.293
TIME. BACK TO BECAUSE IT WASN'T

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.728
RUNOFF BECAUSE IT WASN'T ANY WAY

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:25.829
TO REALLY HONE. THE REPLY- WE

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:26.563
WERE RUNNING THE RACE OF HAVE

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.831
REPLAY. AND VERY LITTLE SUPPORT

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.566
FROM THE PUBLIC- THAT IT WOULD

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.467
HAVE BEEN PASSED. FIRST TO LESS

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.803
VOTE AND BECOME GOVERNOR- TO

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.137
REPLACE PERSON WHO GOT MORE

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:36.673
VOTES. IN FAVOR OF THEM- THAN

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.941
THAN THE OTHERS AND THAT'S A

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:38.442
REAL FATHER WAS A REAL

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:41.244
POSSIBILITY. WITH REGARDS TO-

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.013
THE WAY THIS RECALL IS STILL

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.381
STRUCTURE EVERY STATE DOESN'T

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.982
STRUCTURE TO RECALL THAT WAY.

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.651
AND YET WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.186
DO THAT AND I THINK IT HAS A

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:50.854
TREMENDOUS IMPACT UPON. HOW

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.389
FOLKS DECIDE TO VOTE THERE'S

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:54.024
CONCERN ABOUT. THIS REALLY

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:54.825
DOESN'T LIVE UP TO OUR

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:56.660
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN TERMS

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:58.161
OF THE MAJORITY VOTE AND AS A

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.530
RESULT WE END UP WITH. A HUGE

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.532
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS RUNNING-

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:04.701
WE ALSO WANT TO AND AS A RESULT

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.203
OF THAT THERE IS A DISCUSSION

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:08.505
ABOUT- AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:09.706
THAT THE MECHANIC GOVERNOR.

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.174
SHOULD ACTUALLY. BE THE

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:12.876
REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE AT LEAST

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.678
AT THAT POINT. PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:15.746
VOTING WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:17.848
VOTING FOR. NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.149
THE RECALL BUT WHO THEIR BOOK

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:21.151
WHO WOULD TAKE THAT PLACE AND SO

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.419
THEREFORE. THEY HAVE A SENSE OF

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:24.821
WHAT'S COMING- THE PAST ELECTION

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:27.290
MADE IT SUCH A DIFFICULT THING

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:29.326
THAT PEOPLE HAD. DIFFERENT

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.961
FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD- THEY

00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:32.262
VOTING. AT THIS TIME WHEN THE

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.197
BUILDING SOME. SO THAT IF THEY

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:36.066
THEY WANTED TO RECALL THE PERSON

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.868
THEY MAY NOT LIKE THE CHOI. THAT

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.136
WOULD BE A OR FEARFUL THAT THE

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:40.704
CHOICE THAT WERE BEING MADE-

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.539
I'LL- ON WHERE THE MOST MONEY

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.774
AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.075
WILL LEAVE US WITH A CANDIDATE

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:48.011
OR A SPACE SPLIT- PODOBE

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:51.448
INDIVIDUALS AS WE SELL- ELECTION

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:52.516
. THE CHOICES THAT WERE BEING

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.050
GIVEN THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.685
SOMEONE WITH THE PROBLEM. IF THE

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.020
30% OF THE TOTAL VOTES AND SO

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:58.555
THAT WAS A CONCERN OF GREAT

00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:00.590
CONCERN TO STEER. THE GROUP BUT

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:02.659
ACTUALLY WE- THE LIEUTENANT

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.661
OBVIOUSLY CRAZY WITH YOU AND I

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.463
GUESS WHAT THE- IN THE MEETINGS

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.398
I BIT INTO. SHE KNOW SHE DID

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:09.866
THINK IT WAS A GOOD SYSTEM TO

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.001
BASICALLY HAPPY. LIEUTENANT

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:14.104
GOVERNOR THERE COULD BE ALL. OF-

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:16.907
WELL. ISSUES OF THEM PUSHING THE

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:25.549
RECALL. SO THEY COULD BECOME GO

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:26.583
OVERNIGHT. I PUT THE REALITY IS

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:27.951
ELECT LIEUTENANT. WHAT THE END

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:28.952
IS. THAT THEY PERSON IS PREPARE

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.887
IT WILL BE. TO STEP IN INCOME

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:32.522
THERE IS ANY. OF BACK. IN CASE

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:36.092
THERE IS A- IN CASE THE- REMOVED

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:38.428
THE PERSON FROM. OR IN CASE OF

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.696
UP HORRIBLE. OR SOMETHING OF

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.798
NATURE I SAW **** IS THE-

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:42.399
GOVERNOR LIKE TO BUY SPREAD.

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.534
UNITED ITS PER. TO TAKE ALL-

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.368
THERE'S A FEAR. DIFFERENT

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:46.603
PARTIES AND I'LL KINDS OF THINGS

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.604
ARE CAN HAPPEN MANY OF THOSE

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.739
THINGS. THAT ALSO STOP THAT

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:53.376
MAYBE IF. IN IT SO. THAT THAT IS

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:54.911
WAS GOING TO AT THAT. THAT MODEL

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.546
THAT WE GET. ALSO CHANGE WE

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:59.115
ELECT TO. GOVERNORS THAT WE LOOK

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.584
LIKE TO NEW TEN GOVERNORS. TO

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.686
THE WAY WE SELECTED A VICE

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:03.753
PRESIDENT UNITED STATES. THAT

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.688
THE GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.423
RUN ON THE SAME TICKET. SO THE

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.658
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.759
TO HAPPEN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.294
THAT PERSON. WHO WOULD TAKE AND

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.762
THEN BASICALLY UPLOADING

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.698
FOURTEEN. UP SO THAT WAS ONE OF

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:15.699
THE MAIN THINGS IN FACT MOST

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:17.667
FOLKS FILLED MORE THAN ANYTHING

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.736
THAT- THAT. IT LEFT US

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.204
VULNERABLE TO END UP WITH THE

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.006
WITH THE WITH THE GOVERNOR. WHO-

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.608
WHO DID NOT ENJOY THE MAJORITY

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:27.711
OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT- WAIT

00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:29.379
THEY ALSO COULD. THAT MOST FOLKS

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:30.413
ASK QUESTIONS WHY ARE WE DOING

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.349
RECALL ONE OF THE REASONS FOR

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:33.617
THE RECALL. THAT'S ALL THERE IS

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.619
DISCUSSION THAT YOU MAY WANT TO

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.487
HAVE ABOUT- THE WAY WE IDENTIFY.

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:38.955
WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE OR

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:40.290
INAPPROPRIATE. SOME ARE SAYING

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.858
THAT WE SHOULD USE THE SAME KIND

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.660
OF. LANGUAGE THAT WE USE FOR

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.762
IMPEACHMENT- THAT THIS IS A FORM

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:46.630
OF IMPEACHMENT BY THE PUBLIC

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:47.864
VERSUS IT AND FORM OF

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.399
IMPEACHMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE.

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:50.600
BUT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE TE

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.202
SAME AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.803
LOOK AT THAT AND BASICALLY

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.805
REQUIRE THAT AS A- AS A STANDARD

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.807
FOR THE FILING OF. A PAPERS TO

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:59.042
DO A RECALL THAT THEY HAD THE

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.744
BIG THIS IS THE PEOPLE SAME

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:01.811
STANDARD OF IMPEACHMENT. AND IS

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:03.580
BASED ON PERFORMANCE AND

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.315
BEHAVIOR- THAT IS THE AND THEY

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:06.316
FEEL THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.518
OF INCAPABLE UNSATISFACTORY IS

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:11.021
TOO LATE. AND AND IS SUBJECT TO

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.889
ABUSE. THAT DOUBT THAT WE NEED

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.024
TO HAVE THE GREATER STANDARD

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.091
SIMILAR LIKE WE HAVE WITH AN

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:23.366
IMPEACHMENT. PROCESS YEAH

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.367
CONCERN ABOUT OB. THE CITY

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:26.536
SIGNATURE. AND ENACTED BE BALLOT

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:27.771
WITH OUR- ABOUT PEOPLE. TO HAVE

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:30.373
AN- TO IF WE WAIT IT. TOO HIGH.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.342
WE SAY LIKE SOME STATES YET A

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:33.810
BIT DEPRESSED. OF THE ELECTRIC

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.412
WITH ONE FIVE. BUT THAT MAY IT

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:36.446
VERY DIFFICULT IN THIS DAY. TO

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:39.249
ACT FOR THE- TO. ENGAGE IN. BOB

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.784
AND SO AND SO OF THE SAID. WAS

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.886
THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T END UP AS

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.020
WE DO NOW. WE PEOPLE. KIND OF

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:46.056
ANALYZE WHETHER NAY BUSINESS AT

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.691
A GOOD IDEA TO DO- A RE. THE OF

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:49.793
THE TERM OUT THAT TOOK PLACE THE

00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:51.127
GLOBAL. ELECTION THAT WE SHOULD

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.096
ABOUT IT THE STANDARD THIS

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.631
WASN'T THE HIGHEST ISSUE THAT

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:55.799
PEOPLE REYES. BUT THINK ABOUT

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.867
BASICALLY UTILIZING. OF THE

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:58.835
NUMBERS THAT THAT PRETTY

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.537
STANDARD THAT IS BASED ON THE

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:01.371
NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS NOT

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:02.505
NECESSARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:03.640
OF PEOPLE. WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.141
UP TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION.

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.876
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS AT THE END

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.812
OF THE ABILITY TO- PARTICIPATE

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.780
IN THE RECALL ELECTION. AND SO

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:11.948
THEREFORE THEY THEY SHOULD BE

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.450
ADDED INTO THE VERY WELL THAT'S

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:14.651
THE YEAR. THERE WAS CONCERN

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.719
OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:16.886
TIME AND YOU KNOW MANY STATES

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:18.722
DON'T GIVE YOU A HUNDRED AND

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.090
SIXTY DAYS WHICH IS ALMOST A

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:21.324
HALF WHICH IS A HALF OF A YEAR.

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.793
TO BASICALLY- DO YOU RECALL

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.729
PETITIONS AND WE SAW AN EXTENDED

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:26.930
PERIOD THIS TIME MAINLY BECAUSE

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:29.132
OF THE- COLD EVERYBODY BLAMES ON

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.867
CALL THAT AND THE COURTS AGREED.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.936
AND SO AS A RESULT WE END UP

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.304
WITH ALMOST AN ALMOST A YEAR.

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.106
WELL OF TIME TO COLLECT

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:37.974
SIGNATURES AND THEY WERE. IS

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:39.376
THAT IF THERE ARE FLAWS IN THIS

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:42.712
PERSON'S- PERSONALITY. FLAWS IN

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:45.548
HIS BEHAVIOR OR HIS SERVICE-

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.684
THOSE ISSUES SHOULD BE RESPONDED

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:49.152
TO ALL RIGHT AWAY AND NOT. TAKE

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.620
ANOTHER ALMOST A YEAR OF WORK

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.988
YOU CAN IN A BAG WAY MORE AND

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.556
MORE ISSUES IN APPLE'S ISSUES

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:55.525
TO. THE RECALL SO THERE'S A

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.860
CONCERN THAT ARE PART TIME

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:59.763
FRAMES ENTIRELY TOO LONG-

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:02.499
EVERYONE. SUPPOSED US. CREASING

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:06.536
FEES AND- M. SIGNATURE PRESSURE

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.772
. FOR FOR THE GOVERNOR TO. FOUR

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:09.873
FOUR. CANDIDATE AND THAT BECAUSE

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:11.841
PEOPLE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.743
THE PUBLIC CITY STAFF ACCESS. TO

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.545
THE RECALL. SHOULD BE REASONABLE

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:23.586
BUT IT SHOULD. HAVE ACCESS TO

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:27.157
THE RICO. BOB THIS YEAR- SO

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:27.724
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MAIN

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.426
THINGS THAT FOLKS HAD A- IS A

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:30.827
CONDITION. OF THAT CONCERN OF

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:33.229
WHETHER THERE'S- THAT WE HAVE

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.831
DONE IN. INTO ABOUT. PROCESS WE

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.132
REGARD TO PROCEDURES THE SHOULD

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:39.069
BE. CALL WE CAN'T. WHO ALL THOSE

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:40.170
KINDS OF THINGS ARE OURS ARE

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:42.072
EXTREME IMPORTANT ISSUES- AND

00:55:42.138 --> 00:55:44.574
THAT'S A SAY AN SHOULD BE.

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:47.377
EFFORTS TO DRIVE REALLY THE KIND

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.379
OF RECALL THAT WE WILL TO HAVE

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:51.581
AND THE- THIS YEAR- WE- THINK

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.117
CAUTION. THIS THAT. FACTOR

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.820
ACOSTA ALWAYS A- BUT IT SHOULD

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.688
NOT BE AT A POINT WHERE. FEEL

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:04.594
THAT- DONE RIGHT. AND SO- WE'RE

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:06.196
NOT WE'RE NOT ARGUING THAT THE

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:07.697
COST BACK TO BACK TO THE YEAR.

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:10.133
BUT WE ARE ARGUING SOME OF THE

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:10.767
OTHER ISSUES- THAT MAYBE HAVE

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.535
DIFFICULTY. I UNDERSTAND IT NOW

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.204
BUT I'M SURE TO OUR CALLS BACK

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.139
TO BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING-

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.107
DURING THIS LAST RECALL

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.775
ELECTION. WITH THE NUMBERS WILL

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:20.176
BE OUT TO DATE OUR STAFF IT'S

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:21.878
BEEN WORKING SO LATE LAST NIGHT

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.646
THIS MORNING TO VERIFY ALL OF.

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:26.116
THE MATERIALS THAT CAME IN. THE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.485
LEGISLATURE ITSELF- MADE

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.887
POSSIBLE EIGHT AN ALLOCATION OF

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.689
TWO HUNDRED I THINK IN SEVENTY

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.390
SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:37.193
RECALL PROCESS- AND- AND AS A

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.095
RESULT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. THE

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:41.431
ONLY WE SPENT A HUNDRED NINETY

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.465
SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON THE

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:45.034
RECALL SO WE- WE WERE- WE MADE

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.603
GOOD ON YOUR INVESTMENTS WE DID

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:47.704
NOT. THE WHOLE TUNE IN SO THE

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.672
SPEECH WAS NOT SPENT. UP THERE

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:50.807
WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:53.576
MILLION- THAT WAS COUNTY COST

00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:55.011
AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.246
MILLION. THAT WAS SECRETARY OF

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.615
STATE COST- THERE'S STILL SOME

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.583
COUNTIES THAT HAVE- NEEDED

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.152
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE ABOUT

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.153
SIXTEEN OF THEM BECAUSE THEY

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.121
COULD NOT- BASICALLY PULL OFF

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:06.523
THE ELECTION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:08.024
RESOURCES. AND YOU'LL GET THOSE

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:10.827
IN A REPORT AS IT COMES FORWARD-

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:11.961
THAT TURNED OUT OF COURSE AND

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.530
ELECTION WAS TWELVE POINT EIGHT

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:16.833
MILLION INDIVIDUALS. ABOUT IT.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.901
WHICH WAS A COST OF ABOUT

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.836
FIFTEEN POINT. FIFTEEN DOLLARS

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:21.337
LITTLE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:22.772
PERSON. THAT WE PAY FOR THE

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:25.608
ELECTION- THERE WERE THERE WERE

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:26.676
TWENTY TWO ELIGIBLE REGISTERED

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:28.912
VOTERS- AND WHICH IS GAY AT ALL

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.680
HOLD IT BUT WE DID OUTREACH TO

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:31.948
ALL OF THEM WHICH MEANS THE COST

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:33.583
WAS. EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SIX

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.151
DOLLARS. AND NINETY TWO DOLLARS

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:36.886
PER VOTER AND THAT WAS THE

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:39.556
RESULT- RECALLS ARE EXPENSIVE.

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.057
AND ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.325
IS THAT WHEN WE DO WE CALL THAT

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.927
WE GET IT WE DID IT THIS TIME

00:57:43.993 --> 00:57:45.261
THAT WE- OPERATE THAT THE STATE

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.330
PAYS FOR IT- IT HASN'T ALWAYS

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:49.232
BEEN THAT WAY BUT IT IS IF

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.099
THERE'S A RECALL ELECTION

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.935
STATEWIDE. IT SHOULD TELL THE

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.902
STATE SHOULD PAY THE COSTS OF

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.971
THAT WAS. STRONGLY FELT BY THE

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.673
PERSONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.241
THEY WERE GRATEFUL FOR OBVIOUSLY

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:06.282
FOR- FOR YOU. BEING ABLE TO DO

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:07.283
THAT- JUST IN TERMS THE- ASK. OF

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.186
IT. THE TO. OF ASPECT OF IT IS

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:11.120
THAT. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. A TO

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.255
RUN INTO LAW OR ELECTION SUCH A

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:17.093
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- AFTER WE

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.261
WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.128
OF COLLECTING SIGNATURES

00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:20.897
VERIFYING SIGNATURES THOSE KINDS

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.131
OF THINGS THAT INDICATING THAT

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.566
THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY OTHER WAS

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:24.834
ENOUGH SIGNATURES OBVIOUSLY PUT

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.502
THE RECALL. WE HAD DID

00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:28.471
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAVE BETWEEN

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:29.772
EIGHTY TO SIXTY DAYS- TO

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.741
BASICALLY CALL THE ELECTIONS.

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.142
ELECTION OFFICIALS UP AND DOWN

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.544
THE STATE'S SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.212
THIS IS A BIT MUCH MORE TIME IS

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.947
NEEDED TO ADMINISTER AN ELECTION

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:38.715
IN A STATE THE SIZE OF

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:41.050
CALIFORNIA. UNCERTAINTY AFTER

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.452
THE ELECTION DATE PREVENTS

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.287
PRINTING BALLOTS AND VOTER

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.388
GUIDES AND OTHER REQUIRED

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:47.423
MATERIALS UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.225
AN ELECTION GETTING-

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.827
UNFORTUNATELY WE ONLY HAVE FORTY

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.962
SOME ODD FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR-

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.097
PERSONS ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.531
GOVERNOR I THINK THE LAST TIME

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.066
WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:58.034
SOMETHING. TO TRY TO PRODUCE A

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.669
DOCUMENT WITH THE INFORMATION ON

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.604
ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:02.672
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IS

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:05.408
DIFFICULT AND RUNS THE RISK OF

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.844
LAW ERIS- RUNS THE RISK OF THE

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:10.046
PAPER SHORTAGE AS WE I HAVE OF.

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:11.347
WHAT ABLE TO MEET THAT BUT

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:12.715
WEREN'T SURE INITIALLY WE WOULD

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.217
DO THAT BE ABLE TO MEET THE

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.485
PAPER SHORTAGE THERE'S A PAPER

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:16.653
THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC PAPER

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.154
THAT THE BALLOTS ARE PRINTED ON.

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.622
AND TRYING TO MEET ALL OF THAT

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:21.090
AND NAVIGATE THAT AS WELL AS WE

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.926
HAVE OVERSEAS BORDERS THAT WE

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.427
MAILED BALLOTS TO ANOTHER FEMALE

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.562
EVERYONE A BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.097
IT MAKES IT- A VERY MUCH MORE

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:30.066
DIFFICULT PROCESS ONE IS

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.868
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. IT ALSO

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.369
DOESN'T GIVE MUCH TIME- THE

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:34.570
CURRENT PROCESS DOESN'T GIVE

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:36.005
MUCH CAR IMPROPER PEOPLE TO

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.373
VETS- TO GET TO KNOW THE

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.708
CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.609
GOVERNOR THE WAY THIS IS SO

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:40.743
STRUCTURED IT'S ALL DONE AT THE

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:42.879
SAME TIME- AND AS A RESULT WE

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.180
DON'T GET A CHANCE THOUGH TO

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.915
BASICALLY. TALK ABOUT THE

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.717
QUALIFICATIONS THE ACCESS PEOPLE

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:48.785
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ACCESS

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.620
AND FIGURE OUT WHO'S RUNNING

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.821
WHAT THE REAL ISSUES ARE IT'S

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:53.556
PRINTED IN A BOOKLET BUT IT BUT

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.124
WE DON'T HAVE THE ONGOING

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.060
DISCUSSIONS AMONG CANDIDATES FOR

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.294
THE LARGEST STATE IN THE UNION

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:00.964
SO. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT-

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.132
WOULD CONCERN AS A SAID ABOUT

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.634
THE COST AND A THE ASPECT IT IS

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.102
TRULY ONCE BACKED OUT WE ARE

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.403
CONCERNED ABOUT TO MAKE SURE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.038
THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS. WHAT THE

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:12.275
PROCESS IS. GOING TO- WELL THE

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.043
ISSUES WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:20.249
PERSONS ARE. THAT ARE RUNNING A

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:22.585
WHAT THEY CALL THE- ARE ALL-THOSE KINDS OF THE- BECOME VERY

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:23.720
VERY IMPORTANT. TO THE PUBLIC WE

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.721
TALK ABOUT- REMOVING A GUN. OR

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:25.621
REMOVE ANYWAY FROM OFFICE. AND

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.457
YET W DON'T THAT TIME TO TIME

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.758
TO. IT TO ACCESS IT WE DIDN'T

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.059
MUCH AS WE COULD IN THE

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.494
SIGNATURES. OFFICE WE USED UP WE

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.030
UTILIZE A NUMBER OF- OF-

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.598
RESOURCES IN TERMS OF PUBLIC

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.367
MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.835
MAILING THINGS OUT. TO MAKE SURE

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:40.003
THAT PEOPLE KNEW THAT THERE WAS

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.371
AN ELECTION UNDERSTOOD THE

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.139
PROCESS THEY VOTED TWICE. SO

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.741
FORTH AND SO ON BECAUSE IT'S

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:45.842
DIFFICULT WITH PEOPLE WITH A

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.076
PROCESS THAT YOU DON'T DO VERY

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:48.378
OFTEN. YOU TRY TO GET THE

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.712
INFORMATION OUT AS TO HOW THIS

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:52.315
PROCESS WORKS. SO IN IN THE YEAH

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.417
LET ME JUST SAY THAT- THERE'S

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.752
SOME CONSENSUS THAT THE

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.086
STRUCTURE IN THE LONG TERM

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.055
REFORM DESERVES PERIODIC REVIEW

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:01.190
AND WIDE RANGING. AND PROLONGED

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:03.793
SCRUTINY- THE RECOMMENDATION

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.029
OFTEN IS THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.131
HAVE SOME KIND OF COMMITTEES-

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.132
EVEN MY OFFICE SECRETARY OF

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.099
STATE'S OFFICE OR THE

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.834
LEGISLATURE. THAT PERIODICALLY

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.704
EVALUATES THE RECALL PROCESS. OF

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.305
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALL THAT

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.074
WE STILL. ARE ABLE TO DO THE

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.642
KINDS OF THINGS WE SAY WE CAN DO

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:20.777
WITH THE RECALL TO MAKE SURE

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.478
THAT WE HAVE DONE THE NEXT LEVEL

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:23.413
TO PERFORM IF THERE'S ANYTHING.

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:24.614
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT TO

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.315
TAKE TIME TO FULLY ASSESS WHAT

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:28.017
THE SYSTEM IS BUT- WHETHER IT'S

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.619
BROKEN AND IF SO. WHETHER IT

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:32.055
NEEDS FIXING AND- AND IT WAS NOT

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.223
THE FIXING IS BETTER THAN. OF

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.525
THE PARTS THAT WE HAVE A WHERE

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:37.126
THE NOT THIS IS JUST A BLOCK

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.995
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.296
WITH- SO MUCH THAT CONSIDERED IN

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.364
HIS COMMITTEE THAT WE DO

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.565
SOMETHING LIKE SELECT COMMITTEES

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.900
AND INDEPENDENT CITIZENS

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.802
COMMITTEES AND REFUSED. TO PRINT

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.503
OUT TO KEEP US UP TO WHERE WE

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.971
ARE WITH REGARDS TO RECALL. BUT

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.706
ALSO WITH OTHER ISSUES. MANY OF

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.308
THEM HAD TO ISSUES WITH THE

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.177
WHOLE INITIATIVE PROCESS. THAT

01:01:54.243 --> 01:02:01.851
IS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW- SO

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:02.952
MANY ISSUES ABOUT- ST. IN TERMS

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.353
OF WHETHER OR NOT THE RECALL

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.988
PROCESS AS WELL AS THE PETITION

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:06.456
PROCESS. AND SIGNATURE

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.557
GATHERING. LIVES TO EXPECTATION

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.925
. YOU KNOW WE- WE DIDN'T

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.359
EMBARKED UPON THIS WHOLE

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.495
PETITION ISSUE. FROM THE PUBLIC

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.696
BECAUSE WE FELT THE PUBLIC

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.264
NEEDED A VOICE. AND THE RECALL

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.466
PROCESS TO THE PUBLIC NEED A

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.534
VOICE. BUT THE IS COMPLICATED

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.902
AND DIFFICULT IT IS NOW ALMOST

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.071
EVERYONE AGREES. THAT IT BECOMES

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.806
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.675
PERSON. TO ENGAGE IN

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.610
ESTABLISHING OR DOING A RECALL.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.145
IT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.746
OF RESOURCES AND MONEY. AND

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.448
OFTENTIMES OUTSIDE INFLUENCES

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.383
DETERMINES THE NATURE RECALL AS

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.751
WELL AS THE NATURE OF PETITIONS

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:36.752
THAT WE SEE. IN TERMS OF

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.322
LEGISLATION. SO NOT ALWAYS-

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.423
UNTIL THERE IS GREAT CONCERN

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.058
THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH AND

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:43.659
MAYBE WE CAN'T. TO BASICALLY A

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:45.194
PROBE INTO THE ACT I LOOK

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.295
FORWARD TO WHAT DO YOUR

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.998
RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE- I

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.800
WOULD WANT TO CAUTION ALL OF US

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.202
THAT DOWN. THAT WE HAVE A

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.470
TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY DID

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.839
NOT. RUSH TO JUDGMENT TO NOT RUN

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.908
QUICKLY TO. THE SOLUTIONS WHAT

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.209
TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THEM TAKE

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.978
THEM INTO CONSIDERATION. AND

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.546
REALLY BEGAN TO WORK TO SEE IF

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.348
THERE IS A WAY. THAT WE CAN

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.717
ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG A PROCESS

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:08.551
ONE THAT THE PUBLIC SEES IS

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.520
BEING FAIR. TO IT NOT ONLY TO

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.221
THE PERSON BEING RECALLED BUT TO

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.556
THE PUBLIC ITSELF AND IT REALLY

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.125
IS THE VOICE OF THE PUBLIC. AND

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.727
MANY FELT THAT THIS LAST PROCESS

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:20.229
WAS NOT- THAT DIED IT WAS AS I

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.697
SAID IT DID NOT GIVE THEM THE

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:23.466
ASSURANCE. BACKED UP IF THEY

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:24.734
RECALL THE GOVERNOR THAT THEY

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.335
WOULD BE ACTUALLY SELECTING A

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.970
REPLACEMENT. ALL AND THEY WERE

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.672
CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THAT AS

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.240

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.632
SOMETHING WRONG THAT WE NEED TO

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.101
DO RECALL ABOUT AND WHAT ARE THE

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:39.669
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S ALWAYS

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:40.936
BECOMES IS THIS PERSON BETTER

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:42.638
THAN THE OTHER FORTY THREE AND

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:43.572
THAT BECAME THAT THE

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.241
CONVERSATION MUCH MORE THAN THE

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.610
DISCUSSION OF RECALL- SO I WOULD

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.378
DEFINITELY WOULD SEPARATE THAT.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.713
I WOULD LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.515
THE SPANISH THE RECALL YOU KNOW

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:53.816
WHAT WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:55.084
WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS AND HOW

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.952
DO WE EVALUATE INCLUDE EVALUATE

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.154
WHAT THE APP IS BEEN PROFICIENT

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.089
EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION TO PUT

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.691
IT ON THE BALLOT FOR RECALL

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:02.958
THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.393
IMPORTANT BECAUSE CONSISTENTLY I

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.095
WAS ASKED AS I WENT AROUND AND

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.596
NOT DOING THE RECALL PROCESS IS

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.432
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS WHAT ARE

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:10.766
THE PERSON WHO DOES WRONG I KNOW

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.501
AND IT BECOMES VERY YOU KNOW

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.036
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER BECAUSE OF

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.505
THE FACT. THAT THE- THE

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.007
ALLEGATIONS ALL THE ISSUES OF

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.875
WRONGDOING WOULD NOT VERY CLEAR

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.110
AND THEN PEOPLE WORK GREATLY

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.646
CONCERNED- AT THE END OF THE

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.348
PROCESS AND I SAID THE ONLY

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.849
THING I CAN ENSURE TO MOST FOLKS

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.517
IF THE GOVERNOR'S RECALLED IS

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:29.418
THAT WE WOULD END UP WITH

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.420
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.421
MAJORITY INTEREST OF THE STATE

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.756
OF CALIFORNIA AND I SAY THAT

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.558
BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:36.692
WERE GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:37.960
DIDN'T EVEN WHAT'S WHAT'S NEXT

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:40.129
GET FIFTY PERCENT. ONE AND WE

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:41.630
DON'T HAVE A RECALL AND WE DON'T

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.165
HAVE RUNOFF PROCESS ANYTHING OF

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.900
THAT NATURE I KNOW TO TEN A

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.736
GOVERNOR IS NOT EXCITED ABOUT TO

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.337
STEPPING INTO THAT ROLE BUT THE

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.839
REALITY IS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.607
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. AS A FEEL

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.209
SAFE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:54.543
WHO IS PREPARED TO SET

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.278
EXPERIENCE WHO CAN STEP INTO

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:57.446
THAT ROLE AND WHEN YOU PICKED A

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.215
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR- YOU SHOULD

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:00.716
BE PICKING SOMEONE YOU BELIEVE

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.418
WILL STEP INTO THAT ROLE OF THE

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.553
SAME IS TRUE I THINK WITH THE-

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.455
AND SOME ARGUED AND I WOULD

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:14.130
PROBABLY SAY IF THERE'S APPEARS. TO BE A CONFLICT THEN MAYBE WE

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:14.764
NEED TO HAVE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:15.631
AND GOVERNOR ON. THE SAME TO. SO

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.466
THAT YOU KNOW WERE YOU'RE BY. UP

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.834
FRONT AND THERE PEOPLE WHO MAKE

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.403
IT JUST. COULDN'T UP A- IS. ON

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.437
THE BILL. Y. KNOWING TO THEY

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:22.705
KNOW. WHAT THEY CHOSEN. AS A

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:23.606
SECOND. SO I THINK THOSE ARE

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.174
THE- IS. SAID THERE. IF WE CAN

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:26.542
LOOK AT THE TIME FRAME. I WOULD

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.744
DO THAT. I MAY WILL ALSO. THE

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.479
NUMBER OF TIMES PEOPLE CAN DO

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.047
RECALLS IT WAS SAYING THIS AND

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.416
THAT IT. TOO MUCH IT AT THAT AT

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.084
OUR LEVEL. BUT AT OTHER LEVELS

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.318
WORK THE FIRST TIME YOU DON'T

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.720
GET THE SIGNATURES COME BACK

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:38.554
AGAIN THE SECOND TIME YOU COME

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.623
BACK AGAIN A THIRD TIME. AND IT

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.324
BECOMES JUST THE OF THE WORLD

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.793
RECALLS IN IN TERMS OF OUR

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.028
REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AND UP- IF

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.630
THEY RECALLS A PERSON HAS A-

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.964
LEGITIMATE REASON TO DO THE

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.332
RECALL SHOULD BE DONE IT SHOULD

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.901
BE PUT OUT THERE. AND THEN WE

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:54.437
CAN TALK ABOUT- LOOK UP YOU KNOW

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:55.805
WE CAN DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THE

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.306
PROCESS. IT IS ALSO GOOD

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.442
SUGGESTED THAT WE DO A THAT IF

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:01.777
WE GO DOWN THE PATH WHERE- WITH

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:02.611
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:03.846
ACTUALLY BECOMES THE GOVERNMENT

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.514
THERE'S A RECALL. THAT THAT

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.149
PERSON THAT THE ELECTION TO

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.784
CHOOSE A GOVERNOR HAPPENS AT THE

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.619
NEXT STATEWIDE ELECTION. WHICH

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.221
MEANS IT COULD BE ALL ON AND OFF

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:14.323
YEAR IT COULD BE- WHENEVER WE'RE

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.691
DOING A STATE ELECTION THAT

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.826
WOULD PREVENT US BY HAVING SUCH

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:19.028
AN EXTREME COSTS. FOR ANOTHER

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.296
STATEWIDE ELECTION TO CHOOSE THE

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.631
GOVERNOR. OF THE STATE IT WOULD

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:23.999
BE BLENDED IN WITH THE NEXT

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.968
ELECTION SO. IF SAY FOR INSTANCE

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.937
IF FOR SOME REASON THE NEW SOME

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:30.539
HAD BEEN RECALL THIS TIME-

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.574
COLLECTORS WOULD BECOME

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.509
GOVERNOR. AND SHE AND THEN WE

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:35.010
WOULD HAVE ON ELECTION IN JUNE

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.645
OF THIS YEAR. OUR PRIMARY FOR

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:37.346
THE GOVERNOR AND THEN THE

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.114
GENERAL ELECTION AND WOULD ALLOW

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:40.950
IT SHE WANTED TO RUN. FOR THAT

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.585
SEAT BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD NOT

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.086
INCUR AN ADDITIONAL COST. TO TRY

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.855
TO FEEL THE GOVERNOR'S SAT FOR

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.791
A FEW MONTHS. AND AND UP BECAUSE

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:49.992
WE'VE ALREADY VOTED THERE ARE

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.228
REPLACEMENT. IS THE LIEUTENANT

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.696
GOVERNOR WE DID THAT WHEN WE HAD

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:54.964
THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND IT

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.065
WOULD HOLD TRUE THAT THIS WOULD

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.967
BE A REPLACEMENT. UNTIL WE HAVE

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.268
ANOTHER ELECTION BUT WE WOULD

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:00.569
NOT HAVE TO HOLD OFF UNTIL THE

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.337
NORMAL CYCLE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.771
ELECTION. IT WOULD BE THE NEXT

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.807
STATEWIDE ELECTION. THOSE ARE

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:12.581
THINGS I THINK ARE A REASONABLE-

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.949
AND GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:09:14.016 --> 01:09:15.551
CAN BE PROUD OF OUR- OUR RECALL

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.719
PROCESS. THAT BE FAIR TO THOSE

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.520
WHO WERE. MORE INTERESTED IN.

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:18.521
THE GOVERNOR. WILL BE FOR TO

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:19.889
THOSE WHO ARE. THE OF THE GUY.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.457
WHO'S BY TO BE REACHED. AND TO

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.492
BEGIN. A GOOD. TO THE- IN TERMS

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.126
OF KNOWING- THAT THEY- MADE A

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.528
DECISION TO RECALL BASED ON THE

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:26.262
STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE. AND

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.530
THAT THEY RECALL THE PERSON.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.430
KNOWING THAT THEY'VE ALREADY

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.965
CHOSEN REPLACEMENT WHEN THEY DID

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.667
THE FIRST ELECTION. AND THEN IT

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.002
WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.236
CHECK THAT THE SELECT THE

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.571
GOVERNOR. I MEAN THOSE ARE

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.039
THINGS I THINK THAT ARE.

DO AT WITH THE UNITED STATES.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT WOULD

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.425
ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF. A

TO RUN FOR THE REPLACEMENT. WE

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:28.917
HAVE TO GIVE THEM TIME FRAME FOR

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:30.853
THEM TO- PUT THEIR PAPERS

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:31.987

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.835
THIS GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT. IT'S

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.904
NOT LIKE- YOU KNOW I DO YU LIKE

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.072
THESE PEOPLE THESE OTHER FORTY

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.407
PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PRINT ALL

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.541
THIS MATERIAL FOR AND ALL THE

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:53.676
DOCUMENTS FOR AND ALL THE

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.577
CERTIFICATIONS AND EXAMINE ALL

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.279
THE THINGS THEY PUT TOGETHER-

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.415
THE QUESTION IS IT. POSSIBLE FOR

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.382
YOU SHOULD YOU RECALL THE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.718
GOVERNOR AND- AND IT'S A SIMPLE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:03.952
QUESTION AND BUT IT WILL ALSO

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:05.154
LEAD TO I THINK MORE

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.789
CONVERSATION AND DEBATE AND

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.557
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO.

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:10.759
EXAMINE WHAT THE QUESTION IS AND

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:11.927
WHETHER NOT IT'S A BALLOT ENOUGH

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.462
QUESTION FOR YOU TO VOTE TO

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.730
RECALL THE GOVERNOR RATHER THAN

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.398
HAVING ALL OF THIS STUFF PUT

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.800
TOGETHER AND A SHORT PERIOD OF

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.301
TIME. THROWN AT THE PUBLIC VERY

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.070
QUICKLY AND THEN THEY HAVE TO

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.305
MAKE THESE CHOICES AND THEN MAKE

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.773
LIMITED THINKING STRATEGICALLY

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.709
DO LEVEL FOR THIS VERSUS THAT

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:27.609
THEN THERE WAS A WHOLE MOVEMENT

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.677
TO SAYS DON'T GO FOR ANY

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.012
REPLACEMENT WHICH WHICH

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.313
OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE TURNED OUT

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.215
TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER. AND

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.383
SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T I THOUGHT YOU

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.318
KNOW VOTING FOR ONE OF THE

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.619
VOTING AGAINST THE OTHER INSULT

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:38.887
SO IT REALLY WOULD SIMPLIFY THE

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.823
MATTER IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:42.691
AUG TWO AUG FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE A

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.660
DECISION. AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.328
IT EASIER AND GOING FORWARD THAT

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:47.796
THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT BEEN

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.630
RECALLED A GOVERNOR HAS BEEN

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.532
RECALLED A LOT OF THE OTHER BUT

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:52.367
WE WOULD HAVE A CLEANER AND A

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:54.770
FASTER PROCESS- AND ONE THAT

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:56.205
WOULD PROBABLY GIVE PEOPLE MORE

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.806
INFORMATION. THAN THE CURRENT

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.775
PROCESS WE HAVE. THANK YOU SERVE

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.310
TO WEBER ONE ONE FOLLOW UP

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:05.347
QUESTION TO THAT IF THAT IS. AN

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.248
IMPROVEMENT FROM YOUR

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:09.318
PERSPECTIVE- AT THE STATE LEVEL-

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.620
WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONSIDER

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.422
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO AT

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.457
THE LOCAL LEVEL A WE ALSO CAN

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:23.499
HAVE. THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH IS

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.466
YOU CAN HAVE A RECALL M. AND YOU

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.368
CAN HAVE MULTI. OTHER CAN. TO

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:27.536
WHAT WHAT WOULD IT MAKE MORE

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:32.241
SENSE STE A LOW RE. AS A OTHER-

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:34.376
YEAH REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OR

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:35.611
SOMEBODY DYING IN OFFICE IN

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.479
OTHER WORDS USED TO LOCAL

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.515
PROCEDURE THAT EXIST RIGHT THEN

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.216
IF THE CITY COUNCIL REPLACES YOU

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.185
IF YOU DIE IN OFFICE THE CITY

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.788
COUNCIL SHOULD REPLACE YOU IF

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:47.489
YOU'RE RECALL FROM OFFICE RTHER

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.626
THAN HAVING YES- SAME CHALLENGE

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:52.094
OF HAVING ALL THESE OTHER

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.796
CANDIDATES RUNNING IN THE RECALL

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.030
BEFORE WE KNOW WHETHER WE'VE

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.665
RECALLED. AND THEN AS YOU

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:59.701
STATED- HAVING THE NEXT

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.970
AVAILABLE ELECTION BE WHEN THEY

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:04.973
ACTUALLY THE ELECTORATE VOTES TO

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.341
REPLACE THAT CITY COUNCIL

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.210
CANDIDATE OR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.578
BECAUSE THAT'S RIGHT I THINK I

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.513
SEE THE GREATEST ABUSE OF THE

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.782
RECALL HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT THE

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:17.186
LOCAL LEVEL- WE'RE- PEOPLE THE

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.821
RECALL EFFORT IS BEING DONE.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.589
PURELY FOR NARROW POLITICAL

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:23.492
REASONS AND NOT FOR ANY OF

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:26.528
GREGIS- ETHICAL VIOLATION ON THE

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.564
HEART IT ON ON ON THE PART OF

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.566
THE CANDIDATES SO- DO YOU HAVE

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:31.900
AN OPINION ABOUT THAT DID THE

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.335
FOLLOWING THE SAME KIND OF

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.337
CONCEPT- THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:36.972
AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL FOR LOCAL

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.308
ELECTIONS. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:42.311
I THINK IT SHOULD- YOU KNOW THE

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.546
PROCESS OF REMOVING A PERSON

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:45.514
FROM OFFICE IS A VERY SERIOUS

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.583
THING AND- NOT ONLY FOR THE

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.017
PERSON BUT FOR THE GOVERNMENT

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.319
FOR THE STRUCTURE THAT'S IN HERE

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:51.887
AND THOSE WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:53.355
IT WILL PART OF IT SO IT SHOULD

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.123
BE DONE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AND

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:58.260
NOT DONE- OFTEN- I KNOW THAT-

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.028
I'VE SEEN GROUPS CASES OF ISSUE

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.430
WHERE THERE'S BEEN I DON'T KNOW

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:02.831
THE- RECALL OF THE PERSON WENT

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.733
OVER. WHICH TO ME IF YOU DIDN'T

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.767
DO IT THE FIRST TIME LT'S MOVE

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.603
ON AND SO I THINK IN ADDITION TO

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.238
THAT WE HAVE TO BEAT THIS SOME

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.405
GUARD WILL TO PEOPLE PUT OUT THE

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:11.607
DRAFT AT LEAST BEEN IN OFFICE

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.408
FOR YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN BE

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:14.776
READY CALL YOU HAVE TO DO

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:15.978
SOMETHING IN ORDER TO EARN A

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:18.447
RECALL AND SO- SO THOSE ARE THE

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:18.947
THINGS I THINK THAT ARE

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:21.183
IMPORTANT. SOME CITIES HAVE A

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.151
VARIOUS PROCESSES IN SAN DIEGO

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.286
WE HAVE LOST TWO DIFFERENT

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.755
MAJORS ONE JUST RESIGNED AND THE

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.757
OTHER ONE- NOT GUESS WHO'S BEEN

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:35.797
THIRTY NOW WE PASS WE WERE.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.299
UNIQUE WEEK WE HAD THE WE'VE HAD

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.968
GOVERNOR UP. WILL LEAVE THIS. OF

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.904
VARIOUS. READ AND THE CHAIR OF

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.106
THIS CAN. BECAME THE BIG ACTING

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.440
MAY. I KNOW FULL WELL TONY. WAS

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.175
THE ACTING MAYOR FOR. AND IN-

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.278
TALK GLORIA GLORIA WAS AS NUMBER

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.914
BUT HE WAS. ME AFTER- TWELVE

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.382
CHILDREN LIVE SO THERE A PRESS

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:54.917
THAT'S- THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.351
THAT'S THAT THE CITY. DO

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.020
THEMSELVES WITH THEIR C. COUNCIL

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:58.820
AND I THINK THEY'D CAN

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.489
STRENGTHEN IT PROBABLY BY MAKING

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:02.457
SURE. THAT IF THERE'S A RECALL

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.358
PROCESS THAT THAT'S A PART OF

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:06.895
BUT JOIN PEOPLE. DIED OR MAYOR

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.030
RESIGNS OKAY THAT'S SOMETHING

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.698
ELSE THEY HAVE A PROCESS IN

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.066
PLACE AND THAT THEY USE IN TERMS

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.935
OF. THE CITY COUNCIL OFFICERS

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.170
AND- ACTING MAYOR UNTIL THE NEXT

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.005
ELECTION AND SO FORTH AND SO ON

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:18.240
BUT- I THINK TRYING TO. PEOPLE

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.408
ARE CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE A

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.076
STANDARDIZED AND YOU GO FROM ONE

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.311
BOOK TO THE NEXT SOME CITIES

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:25.113
HAVE 20% FOR RECALL. SIGNATURES

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:28.583
OTHERS HAVE LESS- AND- AND I

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.552
THINK IT'S A NEW ONE IF CITIES

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:31.987
AS MUCH OF A TANAMI AND YOU

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:34.122
PASSABLY CAYENNE- TO MEET THEIR

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.357
NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY CITY IS VERY

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.992
DIFFERENT. AND YOU CAN'T DO A

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.127
LOT OF L. A. B. PROCESS WITHOUT

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:40.028
SUTTER COUNTY OR SOMETHING OF

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.997
THAT NATURE. THE SIZES ARE SO

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.699
DIFFERENT AND- SO DIFFERENT. BUT

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.734
I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:46.335
AT THE PROCESS AND MAKE SURE

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:47.302
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:49.972
THERE ABOUT IT- IN TERMS OF.

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.773
HAVING A DINNER FIVE WHAT THE

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.909
SECESSION YES AND WHO COMES IN.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.610
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- BUT

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:56.845
THEY MAKE IT SHOOTS OUT WHAT

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.714
THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE LOCAL

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.281
LEVEL BUT DOCTOR. ACTUALLY

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.383
HAVING SOME SOMETIMES FRAME AND

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.985
SOME LIMIT TO THE NUMBER RECALLS

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.720
THAT YOU CAN PUT. THIS ON ONE

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.388
PERSON. ALL THAT STUFF CAN BE

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.156
VERY DISRUPTIVE TO IF WE'RE

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.658
CONSTANTLY FALLING PAPERS FOR A

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.493
RECALL ON SOMEONE WHO JUST GOT

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.928
AN OFFICE. AND I'VE SEEN IT

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.930
RECENTLY SURE THE SUCCESSION

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:17.132
PROCESS IF IT IS A SUCCESSION

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:20.168
PROCESS. THAT IS FOLLOWED. IF

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.503
THE SAME SUCCESSION PROCESS IS

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.739
FOLLOWED FOR RESIGNING IS FALL

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.541
FOR RECALL IT WOULD. POTENTIALLY

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.643
DECREASED THE SAME CONFUSION.

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:37.252
AND CHALLENGES THAT. WE HAVE-

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.286
THAT WERE RICH REFER TO AS A

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:39.154
STATEWIDE LAW. WAS TEN A

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.188
GOVERNOR BEING ON THE BALLOT.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:43.492
THANK YES THEY YES. THANK YOU

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:46.094
BENNETT I DON'T WEBBER I HAVE A-

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.329
THE ARGUMENTS MADE. IMPAR

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:47.863
COMMITTEE HERE THAT RICO A

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:48.797
REALLY WERE AND THERE'S NO NEW

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.399
TO CHANGE THIS QUO OR MAKE

01:17:50.465 --> 01:17:50.932
MAJOR. AT FIRST COMMITTEE

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.968
HEARING YOU MADE A NUMBER OF

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.169
POINTS ABOUT THE FLAWS IN THE-

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:55.904
FULL THREE RECALL. AND I'M

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.072
CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:58.874
ON THE URGENCY OF MAKING CHANGES

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.742
TO THE RECALL FOLLOWING LAST

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:03.245
YEAR AS WELL. I THINK IT IS

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.579
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK WE

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.148
CAN WE CAN SAY THIS THIS THIS

01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:07.716
SITUATION ONLY HAPPENS ONCE

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:10.018
EVERY. YOU KNOW WE CAN INITIALLY

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.787
SAID IF THIS IS HAPPENING BUT

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.588
NOBODY'S BEEN RECALLED OKAY OR

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:15.090
THAT'S KIND OF THE CERTIFICATE.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:16.525
THE NOT QUALIFYING FOR THE

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.493
BALLOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.995
MAKE DECISIONS NOW WHILE IT'S

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:21.730
FRESH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS. BUT

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.165
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE RECALL INTO

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:25.834
IT AND IT'S IN A TWO THOUSAND

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:27.069
AND THREE IN FACT THEY TALKED

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.637
ABOUT HOW. THEY HAD CHANGES THEY

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:30.105
HAD IDEAS AND THEN THE

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:32.207
LEGISLATURE DIDN'T HAVE BEEN PUT

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:33.475
FORWARD DIDN'T GET TO THE BALLOT

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.810
SO WHILE IT'S ON THE MINDS OF

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:35.710
PEOPLE AND THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.679
TALKING ABOUT. WE SHOULD MOVE

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.448
FORWARD WITH SOME DISCUSSIONS

01:18:39.514 --> 01:18:41.216
AND POSSIBLY SOME SOME REFORMS

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.851
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:44.086
WHOLE SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.253
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.855
IS. BUT CLEARLY THE FLAWS THAT

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.290
WE SEE IN IT THAT EVERYBODY

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:49.925
AGREES TO THE ACTIONS EVERYONE

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.159
SOME FOLKS DON'T THEY SEE THE

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:51.993
FLOP THEY DON'T THINK IT'S-

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.728
LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE CHANGE.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.030
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.998
DO- AND MOST FOLKS THAT THEY

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.667
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:18:58.733 --> 01:18:59.935
AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:02.971
IT DIDN'T- AND- ISSUES- BOB. YOU

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.806
KNOW ISSUES OF QUALIFICATIONS-

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.775
WHAT IS QUALIFYING FOR PERSON TO

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.276
RUN ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:10.645
CAME TO MY DESK. AND WILL AND I

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:11.980
HAD TO NAVIGATE THE WITHOUT

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.749
HAVING ANY- ANY SUPPORT

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.485
NECESSARILY FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:17.486
TERMS OF THEM HAVING WRESTLE

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.254
WITH THE SAME ISSUES BEFORE. AND

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.956
RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SO WE'RE

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.691
I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL THAT

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.192
THAT THE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.328
SO MUCH. LEFT UP TO CHANCE OR TO

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:28.029
WHO I WANTED TO PICK I WAS VERY

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.965
CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE RULES

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.900
TO MUCH. OF THE MAINLY BECAUSE I

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:32.734
DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.169
THIS WAS SOME MANIPULATION KIND

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:37.072
OF GOING ON. BUT ISSUES- OF

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.507
QUALIFICATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:39.441
RUNNING AND ALL THOSE KIN OF

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.842
THINGS THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.278
JUST KIND OF LEFT OUT THERE AND

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:44.779
SO- AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.313
APPALLED AT WHAT THEY SAW

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.115
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR-

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:48.116
INTELLECTUAL BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.818
FARMERS OUR SYSTEM DOES PRODUCE

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:52.387
AND SO- SO I THINK IT IS TIME TO

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.556
YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A- IT'S

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:55.690
A IT'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.225
WHILE IT'S ON PEOPLE'S MINDS.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.660
PEOPLE CAN VOTE AGAINST IT THEY

01:19:58.727 --> 01:19:59.461
CAN BEFORE THEY HAVE TO.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:05.433
CONSTITUTIONAL. CHANGE BUT I

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.568
THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.637
DO AND IS. NOT BE. SO THAT. I DO

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.071
. WOULD BEEN ONE OF TO HAPPEN.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.040
BUT I IT MAY. BE I DON'T KNOW IF

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:14.109
. THE GROUP CAN LOOK AT FAST.

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.243
OCT AT LEAST WITH. THE OF TIME.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.578
AND PRODUCE TIME CHANGED THE

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.246
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WANT. TO KIND

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.181
OF HEAR. AND DISCUSSIONS THAT

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.283
YOU HAD. A TO DO THAT BUT I

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:24.653
THINK IT IS- WE SAW ONE A RECALL

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:27.255
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- TOOK TWO

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:27.889
THOUSAND THREE WE SAW ONE THIS

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.958
PAST YEAR. AND SOMEONE SAID WELL

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:30.759
THAT'S WHAT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.327
BUT WHO KNOWS IT MIGHT BE

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:33.461

YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ONE.

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:38.700
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'LL BE

ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS THEY MAY

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:41.903

RECALL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:44.585
THEM. THEY BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:46.420
A PERFECT ONE THAT'S CHANGES ARE

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:49.223

SCREEN JUST POP GIVE ME ONE

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.755
SECOND THERE WE GO- AND THAT IS

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:26.226
YOU MENTIONED- A DOCTOR THAT IS

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.494
. GUBERNATORIAL RECALLS ARE

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:31.265
RARE- AND THAT WE'VE HAD BUT TO

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:32.933
WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK FROM

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.536
YOUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:37.571
HERE IN THIS FIELD THAT PAID

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:40.007
SIGNATURE GATHERERS ARE LIKELY

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.709
TO MAKE RECALL ELECTIONS MUCH

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:44.345
LESS RARE THAN THEY WERE IN

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:45.612
THERE AND THEY'LL- OVERALL

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:47.448
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IN

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:48.582
OTHER WORDS ARE WE HAVE. IT

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.084
WHERE WE HAD A PERIOD WHERE

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.086
RECALL ELECTIONS ARE MUCH MORE

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.454
LIKELY TO HAPPEN THAN THE

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.393
HISTORICAL. AVERAGE. I YEAH

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.061
THAT'S A HARD QUESTION FOR ME TO

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:05.699
ANSWER- AND- I THINK THAT ALL OF

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:07.434
. DEFERRED I EXPERIENCE THAT

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.237
THAT- I- COMMITTEE MIGHT HERE

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:13.507
THIS- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:16.076
THAT PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS-

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:19.346
CLEARLY CHANGES THE DYNAMICS OF.

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.916
OF NATURAL RECALLS BUT REFERENDA

01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.351
AND INITIATIVES WHICH ARE

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:26.453
ACTUALLY MORE COMMON. THAN

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.089
CITYWIDE RECALLS WE DO KNOW THAT

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:30.858
THERE ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.793
MANY MORE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:35.429
TODAY- AND WHEN MANY MORE PEOPLE

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:37.564
WHO VOTED. SAID THAT WERE IN THE

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.932
PAST SO IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:40.401
TO SORT OF YOU KNOW MAKE AN

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:43.537
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.038
OUR PAID RECALL OF PAID

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.874
SIGNATURE GATHERERS EXCEPT AS

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:50.978
NAY THAT- IN IN MOST CASES WE

01:40:51.044 --> 01:40:53.147
KNOW THAT. THAT THAT- ITEMS

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:54.848
GETTING TO THE STATEWIDE BALLOT

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:59.953
WITHOUT PAYING SIGNATURE.

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.088
GATHERERS WHAT. WITH WOULD BE

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:04.625
WITH RARE TO OF. THE MILLIONS OF

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.693
SIGNATURES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.831
ABOUT. TO THE THAT A OF. RECALL

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.667
IS BAY ON TRULY ACT BY AN

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.469
ELECTED OFFICIAL WHICH-

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:17.204
HOPEFULLY WOULD MOTIVATE MANY

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:18.305
PEOPLE TO WANT TO SIGN THE

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:23.110
RECALL. IT IT TO. LEADS ME TO

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.112
THIS QUESTION AND THEN THAT I

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.547
GUESS OBSERVATION AND LIKE TO

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:27.748
GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:31.351
THAT IS IF WE MAKE A CHANGE TO-

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.187
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TAKING

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.722
OVER PROPOSALS THAT IS OUT

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:38.559
THERE. IT SEEMS THAT IT WOULD

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:40.327
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.329
INCENTIVE FOR MINORITY

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:46.366
CANDIDATES TO FUND- RECALL

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.502
EFFORTS BECAUSE MINORITY

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:51.104
CANDIDATES WHO REALIZED THAT

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:53.574
THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO WIN

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.711
A MAJORITY VOTE AND A REGULAR

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:58.312
COOLEY SCHEDULED GUBERNATORIAL

01:41:58.378 --> 01:42:00.180
ELECTION. VIEW THE RECALL

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:04.918
PROCESS AS A WAY FOR THEM TO-

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:07.621
TAKE THE SEAT- WITHOUT EARNING A

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.890
MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:12.159
IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE MADE THIS

THIS WORLD SOME PEOPLE QUESTION

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:21.206

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:25.410
CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE ANSWER

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.712
TO THAT QUESTIONIS YES THAT

02:11:26.778 --> 02:11:28.680
WITH PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS

02:11:28.747 --> 02:11:30.582
OUT THERE. RECALLS HAVE BECOME

02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:33.051
DOMINATED. BY THOSE WHO WANT TO

02:11:33.118 --> 02:11:34.453
USE THE RECALL PROCESS FOR

02:11:34.519 --> 02:11:37.155
NARROW. POLITICAL INTEREST

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:38.857
RATHER THAN FOR WHAT THEY'RE

02:11:38.924 --> 02:11:41.360
DESIGNED FOR WHICH IS- TO REMOVE

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:42.894
FROM OFFICE PEOPLE THAT ENGAGE

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:46.265
IN EGREGIOUS- OF MISCONDUCT OR

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:48.000
SERIOUS ETHICAL VIOLATIONS AND

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.835
THAT ARE OUT THERE. WILL GIVE

02:11:49.901 --> 02:11:51.703
TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT AND ONE IS

02:11:51.770 --> 02:11:53.405
A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THEY CAN

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:56.608
ONLY WIN. IN A RECALL ELECTION

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:58.877
THAT STARDOCK DESIGNED TO ALLOW

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:01.179
A CANDIDATE WHO GETS A PERHAPS

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.815
SMALL NARROW SLICE OF THE VOTES

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:06.285
TO BECOME. THE GOVERNOR OF

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:09.454
CALIFORNIA- THAT IS A MOTIVATION

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:10.889
FOR SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:12:10.956 --> 02:12:12.758
AND FUNDS TO FLOW IN TO RECALL

02:12:12.824 --> 02:12:15.294
CAMPAIGNS. THE SECOND IN THAT

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.029
ONE THAT WE SEE VERY MUCH AT THE

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:18.830
LOCAL LEVEL ARE PEOPLE WHO AT A

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:20.132
LOCAL LEVEL HAVE KNOW WHAT

02:12:20.198 --> 02:12:22.834
EVIDENCE OF- OF THE PREVIOUS

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.069
MISCONDUCT OR ETHICAL

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:26.738
VIOLATIONS. BUT SIMPLY DISAGREE

02:12:26.805 --> 02:12:29.975
WITH A POLITICAL OF POSITION

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.777
TAKEN BY A LOCAL ELECTED

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:33.545
OFFICIALS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:35.213
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP PROVIDES

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.450
OUR EXETER- AND- WHILE THEY HAVE

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:40.686
THE RIGHT TO DO THAT- OF. PAID

02:12:40.752 --> 02:12:42.487
SIGNATURE GATHERERS ALLOW THOSE

02:12:42.554 --> 02:12:45.757
PEOPLE TO ALSO- GATHERED THE

02:12:45.824 --> 02:12:47.592
SIGNATURES OFTEN WEST OF

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:49.061
MISREPRESENTATIONS OF WHAT

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.762
THEY'RE GATHERING AND I THINK WE

02:12:50.829 --> 02:12:52.097
WE'VE ALL SEEN PLENTY OF THOSE

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:55.200
EXAMPLES. SO I. WOULD OFFER THAT

02:12:55.267 --> 02:12:57.302
I SUPPORT THE CLARITY THAT

02:12:57.369 --> 02:13:00.138
COMES. FROM IDENTIFYING FOR

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:01.473
EXAMPLE THAT THE LIEUTENANT

02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:02.874
GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE THE

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:03.575
PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:08.914
RECALL. THE CLARITY. THAT COMES

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.182
FROM- THIS HANG. THE LOCAL

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:12.784
PROCESS WE BE. A RE. OR THREE

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.119
PLACEMENT IF SOMEBODY IS

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:15.620
RECALLED IS THE SAME AS IF IT

02:13:15.687 --> 02:13:17.856
AND IF SOMEBODY RESIGNS BECAUSE

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.257
THAT CLARITY DECREASES THE

02:13:19.324 --> 02:13:21.626
INCENTIVE FOR MINORITY

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:24.096
CANDIDATES TO TRY TO PUSH

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.931
THROUGH A RECALL AND I THINK

02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:28.400
THAT WITH THAT SINGLE CHANGE. WE

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.736
WILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASE- THE

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:33.305
INCENTIVES AND THEREFORE- THE

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:35.374
FREQUENCY OF INAPPROPRIATE-

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.008
RECALL EFFORTS THAT THAT WOULD

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:39.111
BE OUT THERE. THANK YOU VERY

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:55.627
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE SHOULD BE

FUNCTIONAL THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:06.138
REVIEWING AND THIS IS PROBABLY
