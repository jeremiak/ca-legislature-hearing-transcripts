I THINK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AS

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.301
WE REDUCE THE CYCLE TIME OF THE

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:44.436

AND THEIR THEIR AND WE HAVE

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:16.967
SOME. IT'S ALL MUSIC- DOWN TO

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:19.970
TALK ABOUT CRITICISMS BECAUSE

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:23.707
THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED ONE OR

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:26.310
TWO WERE JUST A FEW.

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:28.812
UNFORTUNATELY GOT TIRED TO PART

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:31.015
OF THE BECAME A CULTURE OF THE-

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:31.548
SO THAT I SEE THAT AS A

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:32.182
CHALLENGE AND I KNOW THERE HAVE

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:39.990

SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT. VERY

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.862
SPECIFICALLY ON THE TRAINING OF

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:48.465
THE STAFF. ON THE CHANGE OF THE

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:51.035
CULTURE OF THE DMV. WHAT WHAT

GET THERE. COUPLE QUESTION SO.

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:02.713
TO LET'S SAY THE FRONT. I THINK

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:08.485
WE SAW. THE KIDS ARE BEFORE IT

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:08.986

THAT WAS ON THE DAY ARE AT THE

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:20.631
END OF THE DAY AND HE WAS FULLY

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.231
ALIGNED WITH THE MISSION WHAT

00:43:21.298 --> 00:43:24.535
WAS READ. THEM. HOW TO. PERFORM

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:27.304
THEIR- BEST I SAW. THE RESULTS.

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:29.206
FOR IN TERMS OF JUST LOOKING

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.141
DISTRICTS. IDENTITY MORE LIGHT

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:31.542
IN THE OPERATIONAL

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:35.846
EFFECTIVENESS POST. NIXON STAY

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.148
WAS SENT TO THAN PRE WHAT I CAN

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:40.818
TO COME YEAH AT THE TEN OR 15%

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:43.187
MOVE ON A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBERS

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:46.824
IS IMPRESSED EITHER

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:47.458
TRANSACTION. I THINK THE TEAM I

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:50.227
THINK BETTER UNDERSTOOD BETTER

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:53.964
THAN NO TRAINING TO BE GETTING

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:54.598
YEAH THE WIND THE MORNING AFTER

00:43:54.665 --> 00:44:01.372
OUR. I HAPPEN IN BROAD I THINK

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:01.939
THAT THE CHALLENGE HAS TO DO

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.507
THAT HE- ORGANIZATIONAL YOU

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:09.279
KNOW IN IT AND HOW THE F.

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:09.880
ORGANIZE EDIT. AND I WAS IN IN

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:10.447
THE IN THE OC OUT AS WELL I

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:14.385
READ THAT DURING MY PROCESS I

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:14.985
WAS WHEN THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:15.619
LIKE IT LEARN ABOUT THE V. IN

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:16.220
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:19.456
BEEN SIX CHARGES UP. TO YOU TO

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.657
CHANGE HOW WE MAKE. AND I

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:23.227
GIPSON SAMPLE AWHILE AGO. FIELD

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.628
OPERATIONS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.964
HOWARD HUGHES THE CYCLE.

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:30.267
INTERESTING SACRAMENTO THINK

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.337
ABOUT THINGS SHOULD BE IN HE'LL

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:34.004
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.639
THE FIELD THEY REALLY DON'T

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:36.273
KNOW WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF THE

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.045
EMPLOYEE AND HOW THAT. I THINK.

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:41.645
IN THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT THIS

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:44.381
OP WITH THE CLUB CREST. THOSE

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.583
DECISION RIGHT DOING THE WORK.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.952
CONSULT WITH OTHER FOLLOWING

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.255
THE LAW. WITH THAT MOVEMENT WE

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:53.657
ARE ABLE TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.426
MOVE IN IN THE IN THE TIME IT

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:58.128
TAKES TO PROCESS THE

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.363
TRANSACTION BECAUSE OPERATIONS

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:03.100
TEAM HAD A IF THE WELL YOU KNOW

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:06.070
THAT. THEY WERE IN THAT. THEY

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:10.040
ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT DO YOU DO IT.

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:10.574
REALLY DID WHAT THE MODEL

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:13.143
SENSITIVE. IT IS LIKE THAT THE

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.813
MOVE. KIND OF A VERY RISK

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:16.346
AVERSE CULTURE SACRAMENTO

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:20.451
STREET CULTURE TOO. BY MAKING

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.420
DECISIONS WE NEED AIRPORT AND I

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.021
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THERE

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:24.855
ARE A LOT DIRECTION WE'RE

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:29.159
TRYING TO GO BUT IF YOU IN

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:29.726
THAT. IS A LOOK ON TUESDAY

00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:31.895
BETWEEN THESE TWO. YOU CAN

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:34.765
PRETTY MUCH YOU NEED. DROUGHT

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:37.134
WHAT'S GOING TO WORK IN. ACROSS

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:41.738
THE STATE. VERY GOOD IN A SHORT

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:44.808
BY CHANCE HE TAKING SOME OF THE

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:45.409
SHACKLES OFF OFF THE FIELD AND

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:48.545
WE HAVE TO DO THIS WAS NOT JUST

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:49.146
OKAY WAY I SO WANTED DOWN THE

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:53.684
CHAIN THING IS FINE. BUT NOW

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.218
HE'S SERVING OKAY INTO THE

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:58.555
CULTURE TO THAT. ONE RESPOND

00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.123
WITH TRENDY INTEREST IN WHY

00:45:59.189 --> 00:45:59.723
THEIR TRUCK WHEN I WAS TRYING

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.357
TO DO. SO THINK ABOUT TEST THE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:00.991
HYPOTHESIS RUNNING EXPERIMENTS.

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.759

WE LEARNED WHAT WE EXPECT

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:10.667
TESTING SYSTEM. POSITIVE

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:11.268

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:27.317
TWENTY MINUTE TESTING TIME FOR

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:30.721
