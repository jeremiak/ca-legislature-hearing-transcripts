00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.409
THERE ARE COUPLE OF CHALLENGES

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.811

WE'VE MADE IN ADDRESSING THE

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.460
GAP IN VACCINATION RATES TODAY

00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:57.561
WE WILL HAVE REAL TIME

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.629

INJURY HARM AND SUICIDE SO THAT

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:06.436
WE CAN DELIVER PROGRAMMATIC AND

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:09.806
POLICY RESPONSES. THAT ARE-

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:12.209
TIMELY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.144
THIS IN AREAS OF OPIOID

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.679

ATTRIBUTED TO OPIOID WE'VE BEEN

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:19.449
ABLE TO DO THIS IN OTHER AREAS

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:20.584
OF HEALTHCARE. CALIFORNIA MUST

STRENGTHEN ITS STRATEGY TO

BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.123
HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:28.158
SUICIDE IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.526
THINK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.895

THERE'S A COMMUNICATIONS

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.715

ADDRESSED AND THAT

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.518
COMMUNICATION ELEMENT MUST BE

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.653

APPROPRIATE POLICIES IN MANY

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:31.227

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.663

PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS EVEN

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:44.240

HAVE A BROAD VISION FOR WHAT IT

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.782
MEANS TO ENSURE THAT THESE

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.284
NUMBERS COME DOWN QUICKLY

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.785
DRAMATICALLY IN ACROSS ALL

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.021
SECTORS OF CALIFORNIA DOING

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.889
THAT WILL MEAN BUILDING OUT

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:00.690
ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS WITH

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.426

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.789
APPROACH THAT WE ARE SEEKING

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.757

THE SECTOR TARGETS. AND FINALLY

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.498
WE- THAT THE PROCESSES OF

OFFICE NEED HAVE TRANSPARENCY

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.202
AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT. IN THE

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.336
PROCESS OF SETTING TARGET

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:04.573
SHOULD BE DONE IN A WAY THAT

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.140
INCREASES CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.975
PROGRAM. BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.877

PUBLIC COMMENT ON PROPOSED COST

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:20.656
TARGETS. A SEPARATE MEETING

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:21.657
WITH THE DIRECTOR WOULD

INDICATIVE OF THE WAY WE WOULD

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.278
WANT TO APPROACH STAKEHOLDER

IN THE STATE FOR A WHILE- AND

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:44.773
THAT THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATIVE

FIND TO BE GENERALLY REASONABLE

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:28.750
BUT WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.052

THESE COMPUTER SYSTEMS- THAT

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:03.345
THEY'VE BEEN USING THAT THE

COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.925
BE OUT OF GOING TO FINALLY BE

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:19.194
AT A AT AN APP BASED SYSTEM

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.862
WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.364

CENTURY. AND WE'RE CALIFORNIA

MEMBER IS CONCERNED SO IN TERMS

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:54.663

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:55.497
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.999
OFFICE NOTED SO IT IS TRUE THAT

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.768
THE WHEN WE STARTED OUR

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.237
STAFFING. MODEL WE DID LOOK TO

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:03.872
MASSACHUSETTS I THINK WE'VE ALL

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.273
RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA'S

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.708

MASSACHUSETTS AND BELIAU ALSO

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.878
NOTED THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:11.880
PROGRAM SO THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.516
IS TO- REALLY BEND THE COST

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.251
CURVE AND WE THINK THAT OUR

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:17.552
MODEL IS IT. IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.154
LEVEL OF STAFFING GIVEN THE

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.089

WERE HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.396

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:36.104
IMPRESSED BY BY STAFF ABILITY

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.439
TO BUILD SYSTEMS VERY QUICKLY

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:38.807
AND VERY EFFICIENTLY SO THIS IS

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.942
NOT DESIGNED TO BE A CONSUMER

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:44.179
FACING- HELP OF COMPUTER SYSTEM

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.147
THAT WOULD HAVE AN APP ON A

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:47.415
PHONE UP FOR EXAMPLE. BUT WE

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:48.617
HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.485
BUILDING NEW SYSTEMS THAT

INTERFACE WITH WITH THE HEALTH

PLANS WITH THE PROVIDERS TECH

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.756
TO CAPTURE THEIR DATA SO I FEEL

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.758
VERY CONFIDENT- IN MY TEAM'S

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.793
ABILITY TO SUCCEED ON THE DATA

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.495
FRONT. ANNUAL ACTUALLY BE ABLE

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.930
TO SHARE THE DATA BACK AND

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.065
FORTH IN AND DO THE THINGS

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:09.504
INSTEAD OF BEING STUCK IN A.

WORKING ON THIS I KNOW WE HAVE

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.933
BEGAN THIS CONVERSATION WHEN WE

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:19.901
WORKED ON A SELECT COMMITTEE

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:23.304

FOR YOU DIRECTOR RIGHT I WANTED

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.546
TO GET IN ABOUT THE SILO VERSUS

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.515
COLLABORATIVE. NATURE OF

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.484
SETTING TARGETS FOR SECTORS. I

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.786
WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.288
BIT ABOUT HOW WE DON'T SHIFT

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:42.624
COSTS OF FOR. A LOOKING AT

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.392
CERTAIN SECTORS AND POTENTIALLY

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:47.695
NOT OTHERS AND HOPING YOU COULD

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:48.329

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:50.365
COLLABORATIVE. ABSOLUTELY SO I

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.800
THINK WE NEED TO DO ABOVE AND

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:54.135
APPROACH HERE I THINK IT IS

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:56.537
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BOTH LOOK

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:57.505
AT THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AND

01:27:57.572 --> 01:28:00.475
HAVE- SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.510
GOALS FOR TOTAL COST OF CARE.

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:05.213
BUT ALSO TO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.848
IT'S AT WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:07.649
COST DRIVERS ARE THERE

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.717
PRIMARILY WITH HOSPITALS WHAT

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.586
PROVIDERS WITH TECHNOLOGY WITH

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.688
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT IS OUR

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:18.059
HOPE IS AGAIN WITH TRANSPARENCY

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.027
REPORTING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND.

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.094
HOW COSTS ARE CHANGING OVER

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:22.764
TIME BUT ALSO WE DO VERY MUCH

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.832
WANT TO HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THE

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:25.867
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IS A

01:28:25.933 --> 01:28:27.502
PATH AS OPPOSED TO A SILENT

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.270
APPROACH- WE HOPE THAT THIS

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:30.705
WILL SPUR ADDITIONAL

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:31.906
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:32.940
DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.175
HEALTHCARE. INDUSTRY TO WORK

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:35.543
TOGETHER TO MEET THE COST

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.478
TARGETS THAT ARE SET- AGAIN I'M

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:38.946
JUST KNOW THE ADVISORY BOARD IS

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:41.282
GOING TO PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE-

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.384
IN IN HAVING ECONOMIC EXPERTISE

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.053
AND HAVING EXPERTISE ABOUT THE

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.255
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- AND HOW IT

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.357
FUNCTIONS. AND SO WE HAVE FAITH

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:50.725
IN IN THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:53.127
PUBLIC PROCESS THE ABILITY FOR

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.362
ALL OF THE PARTIES TO BE AT THE

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:56.631
TABLE I'M CONTRIBUTING AND FOR

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.232
THE ADVISORY BOARD CHAT TAKE

01:28:58.299 --> 01:28:59.801
THAT INPUT AS THEY PICK WHAT

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.402
WHAT ECONOMIC INDICATORS MOST

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:02.970
APPROPRIATE FOR HEALTHCARE. AND

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.039
WHAT CONDITIONS- ARE HAPPENING

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.474
IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHO COULD

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:07.575
HAVE PREDICTED A FEW YEARS AGO

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.143
THAT WE WOULD. BE HERE WITH THE

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.244
PANDEMIC AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.846
HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:14.248
COSTS AND SO WE WOULD IT'S VERY

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.651
IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO BE

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:21.289
AGILE ENOUGH TO ADJUST. AS

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.024
CONDITIONS CHANGE- HELLO THOSE

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.992

01:29:26.594 --> 01:29:28.830
TO. REALLY HAVE A CLARIFICATION

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.698
BETWEEN THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.433
AND THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.303
BOARD AND- HOW THAT INTERFACE

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:37.371
WILL WORK AND HOPING YOU COULD

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:40.341

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:41.642
IN PART- YOU KNOW COVER

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.177
CALIFORNIA BOARD I THINK IS A

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.679
GOOD EXAMPLE FOR US AS A RECENT

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:47.115
HEALTHCARE ENTITY- WHERE THERE

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.816
IS A SIGNIFICANT STAFF THAT'S

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.151
DOING A LOT OF WORK THAT'S

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.320
DIRECTLY NEGOTIATING. WITH

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.821
HEALTH PLANS IT'S COLLECTING

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.523
DATA THAT'S DETERMINING

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.792
ELIGIBILITY- BUT THERE ARE KEY

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.994
POLICY DECISIONS THAT WILL BOTH

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.130
THERE'S AN ASPECT OF PUBLIC

01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.464
TRANSPARENCY AND HAVING A

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:06.267
BOARD. AND HAVING PRESENTATIONS

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.168
TO THE BOARD ABOUT ALL OF THE

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.538
COMPONENTS- IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.240
COVER CALIFORNIA. AND NOW. NOT

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.975
REGIONAL LIKE HAVING EXPERTS IN

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:15.843
THE HEALTHCARE FIELD I CAN HEAR

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:16.844
THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE SOME

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.846
OF THE KEY HOLE SO THE CONCEPT

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:19.547
OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.649
AFFORDABILITY. IS THAT WE WOULD

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.484
HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.520
ECONOMISTS- TOURNEY'S

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:28.156
RESEARCHERS A DATA COLLECTION

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:30.625
EXPERTS STATE AUDITORS TO MAKE

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.425
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:32.927
DATA PIECES RIGHT THAT WE'RE

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:34.629
BUILDING A SYSTEM. I'M DOING

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.364
THE ACTUARIAL AND OTHER TYPES

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.966
OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND- THAT

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:41.402
FORECASTING THAT WE NEED TO DO-

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:42.970
AND TO PRESENT THAT INFORMATION

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:44.338
TO THE BOARD BUT BUT BY VIRTUE

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:46.007
OF. OF PRESENTING IT TO THE

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.575
BOARD ALSO IT'S PRESENTED TO

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:48.576
THE PUBLIC AND THERE'S

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.778
OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT- AND THEN

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.413
THE BOARD IS ABLE TO TAKE THAT

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.316
INFORMATION. DIRECT ADDITIONAL

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.151
INFORMATION THAT THEY MAY WANT

01:30:57.218 --> 01:31:00.254
AND- VOTE OF FIVE MAJORITY ON

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.656
THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:03.457
INDICATOR FOR THE COST TARGET

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.927
SO I THINK IT'S A- GOOD MODEL

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.562
IN TERMS OF HAVING A STAFF

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.797
EXPERTISE. WITHIN GOVERNMENT

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.465
AND THEN ALSO HAVING THE

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:13.201
EXPERTISE ON THE BOARD WITH A

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:18.673
BROADER VIEW- AND. PUBLIC AND

01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:19.307
TRANSPARENT PROCESS. THERE WAS

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:20.408
SOMETHING IN THE CAR USE THE

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:23.978
ADVISER BOARD KEEP. TO AND-

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.480
ANYTIME ALSO THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:29.283
ARE EMPOWERING NEW NON ELECTED

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:33.721
BOARD IT'S- HARD. FOR US TO

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:36.390
HAVE THE TRUST AND FAITH- BUT

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.559
KNOWING YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.561
ON MORE THAN ABLE AND WILLING

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:41.929
TO WORK WITH YOU AND BE

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.097
COLLABORATIVE TO MAKE SURE

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.199
IT'S- REFLECTIVE OF ALL OF OUR

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:47.301
VALUES. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:49.270
MAKE SURE THAT THAT ROLE IS

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.105
BETTER DEFINED AND WE HAS THE

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.608
LEGISLATURE. DID NOT ABDICATE

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:59.146
OUR RESPONSIBILITY- BUT STILL-HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERFACE

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:00.414
AND PARTICIPATE IN THOSE KEY

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:03.017
POLICY DECISIONS AS THEY'RE

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:04.485
COMING POINT. SO WHERE'S THE

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.320
KEEP POLICY DECISION WILL BE TO

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.256
SET THE COST TARGET ITSELF- BUT

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.891
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:11.592
OPPORTUNITIES FOR. FOR

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.827
DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:16.631
AND. AND WE WILL NOT. IF

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:17.431
QUESTION IF I CAN ANIMAL MOVE

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:20.301
ON. WITH THE AGENDA- YOU YOU

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.937
HAD SAID EARLIER IT'S A- NOT A

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.473
LOW COST LOW VALUE SYSTEM AND

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.775
IT DOES NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.877
OF QUALITY. SOMEONE WHO SPENT

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.379
MOST OF THEIR LIFE FIGHTING FOR

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:35.950
HEALTH EQUITY. IT'S- I WANT TO

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.685
MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.186
DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT WE ARE

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:42.156
NOT SPEAKING IN THE DISPARITIES

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:44.458
THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:47.595
MAKE SURE THAT- POPULATIONS WHO

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:50.097
ARE VULNERABLE OR- THAT WERE

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:52.833
WORKING ON THEM AND WAS HOPING

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.669
THAT YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT.

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:55.803

COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA- IT'S

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.241
CERTAINLY ONE THAT THAT THE

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:01.809
ADMINISTRATION AND I SHARE WITH

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:03.511

PERFECTLY HONEST THIS IS AN

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:05.947
AREA THAT NEEDS MORE

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.748
DEVELOPMENT BUT I WANT TO STATE

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:08.783
AT THE OUTSET THE WERE VERY

01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:10.418
COMMITTED TO NOT LOCKING IN

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.553
INEQUITIES AND SO I THINK YOU

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.587
KNOW AS YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:14.989
ABOUT WERE VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:15.923
GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.925
MEASURE. QUALITY AND EQUITY

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:19.827
METRICS ALONG THE WAY SO AGAIN

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:21.095
WE'RE WE'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.430
A RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHICH IS

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:23.531
THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:26.834
DO- BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:28.035
FIGURED OUT IS HOW NOT TO TAKE

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.870
IT AND IN EQUITY RIGHT SO IF

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.572
YOU HAVE. A MEDICAL GROUP FOR

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.441
EXAMPLE THAT IS PROVIDING VERY

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:36.978
FISHING CARE- THEY SAID THEY

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:38.679
WON'T BE LIMITED BY BY THEIR

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:40.047
STARTING POINT AND SO WE'RE

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.349
TRYING TO START LOOKING AT

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:43.451
DIFFERENT WAYS OF ADDRESSING

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:44.952
THAT AND VERY MUCH WELCOME.

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.321
STAKEHOLDER ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:48.389
INPUT SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDER

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:50.458
INPUT ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT-

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:53.127
WE THINK BECAUSE THERE IS SOME

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:54.795
ABILITY TO SET DIFFERENT

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:58.165
TARGETS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA- AND

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:59.600
BY SECTOR ONE PICKED COULD

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.611
ADDITIONAL GROWTH IN THAT AREA

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:13.147
FOR EXAMPLE BUT VERY OPEN TO

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.548

HEARING FOLKS SPECIFIC THOUGHTS

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:17.018

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:31.298

I NOTED YOU SAID YOU KNOW

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:48.516
OBVIOUSLY WANT THE LEGISLATURE

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.117
INVOLVED IN POLICY. YOU'RE

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:52.086
CONCERNED ABOUT POLICY

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:54.021
DECISIONS MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE-

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:57.425
MY KID. THE AND THE EXPERTISE

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.326
IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WILL

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:02.596
HAPPEN WITH THIS DEPARTMENT- IS

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:04.298
SIGNIFICANT AND THESE WILL

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.667
THESEGOALS WILL NOT BE ARRIVED

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:09.837
AT LIGHTLY SO THE ABILITY FOR

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:11.005
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:13.107
LEGISLATURE TO ANALYZE THIS AT

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:14.508
THAT LEVEL IS VIRTUALLY

01:35:14.575 --> 01:35:15.743
IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS THEY'RE

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.812
WORKING HAND IN HAND ON A DAILY

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:19.680
BASIS WITH THIS SO THE IDEA

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.782
THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD NEGOTIATE

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.918
AS A LEGISLATURE THESE GOALS I

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.419
THINK WOULD BE A HUGE

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:26.687
DISSERVICE TO THE OFFICE AND

01:35:26.754 --> 01:35:28.155
THE EXPERTISE OF THE PEOPLE

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:30.357
WORKING HERE. AND POTENTIALLY

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:31.692
POLITICIZED AS THIS

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:34.462
SIGNIFICANTLY AS INDIVIDUAL

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.163
ENTITIES MIGHT DECIDE THEY

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.698
DON'T LIKE THAT GOAL AND THEY

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:38.666
WANT TO ENGAGE MEMBERS OF THE

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.301
LEGISLATURE WHO DON'T KNOW EVEN

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:41.669
HOW THE DATA WAS EN MASSE TO

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:42.970
PUT THIS TOGETHER SO WE HAVE TO

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.039
BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:47.908
WE DON'T TIP THE SCALES. IN A

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.643
POLITICAL WAY- TO BENEFIT

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.312
CERTAIN PLAYERS OR WHOEVER

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:52.546
MIGHT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WHAT'S

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:53.914
GOING ON I THINK THE IMPORTANT

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:56.484
THING HERE TO NOTE ALSO IS THAT

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:59.053
THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.522
PUNITIVE AND I THINK IT'S BEING

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:03.824
PRESENTED BY BY SOME PEOPLE WHO

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:05.159
ARE WHO WHO OPPOSE WHAT WE'RE

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:07.728
DOING OR HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.530
WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE NEED

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.065
PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO THINK

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:12.666
DIFFERENTLY AND OPERATE

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:15.202
DIFFERENTLY AND IF WE WERE

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.570
GOING THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.739
IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY-

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:19.907
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT WASTE AND

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:21.942
HEALTH CARE. HUGE AMOUNTS OF

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:22.843
WASTE AND HEALTH CARE WE KNOW

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:24.645
THAT JOURNAL OF AMERICAN

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.147
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION POINTED

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:28.883
THAT OUT VERY DIRECTLY- AND SO

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:31.485
IF WE CAN JUST GET PEOPLE. EVEN

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:32.953
JUST A FOCUS ON SOME OF THAT

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.022
BENDING THE HEALTHCARE COST

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:36.357
CURVE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.958
THERE WE GOT TO START THINKING

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:39.860
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT. AS FAR

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:42.129
AS INEQUITIES TRUST ME YOU AND

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:44.265

WHO WANNA DO ANYTHING. THAT

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.608
EXACERBATES ALREADY EXISTING

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:57.311
EQUITIES IN IN CONTRAST WE WANT

01:36:57.378 --> 01:36:59.580

02:43:32.536 --> 02:43:34.804
IN A WAY WE SIMPLY WEREN'T

02:43:34.871 --> 02:43:37.174
DOING THAT- ONE OF THE WAY ONE

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.475
OF THE AREAS WE'VE SEEN. WHERE

02:43:38.542 --> 02:43:39.543
WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT IN HOW CARE

02:43:39.609 --> 02:43:40.744
IS DELIVERED AS IN FAMILY

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.479
PLANNING SERVICES AND- WHAT

02:43:42.546 --> 02:43:43.647
WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT PATIENTS

02:43:43.713 --> 02:43:45.415
HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO THIS.

02:43:45.482 --> 02:43:48.818
AND IT CAN BE- IN MANY CASES

02:43:48.885 --> 02:43:49.419
THEY ACTUALLY PREFERRED IT'S

02:43:49.486 --> 02:43:51.421
MORE CONVENIENT. IT CAN ENSURE

02:43:51.488 --> 02:43:53.056
PATIENT PRIVACY ELIMINATES

02:43:53.123 --> 02:43:54.491
TRANSPORTATION TIME AND THE

02:43:54.558 --> 02:43:56.259
NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK.

02:43:56.326 --> 02:43:57.894
THEY BRING SERVICES TO WHERE

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.996
THE PATIENT IS. WE'RE BUILDING

02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:01.064
OFF OF A MEDICARE RATE

02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:02.465
STRUCTURE THAT IN MANY CASES

02:44:02.532 --> 02:44:04.367
BELOW COMMERCIAL PAYERS- PAY

02:44:04.434 --> 02:44:06.036
FOR THE SAME SERVICES. SO I

02:44:06.102 --> 02:44:07.103
THINK A PARITY REQUIREMENT

02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:08.939
MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THESE-

02:44:09.005 --> 02:44:12.742
SERVICES IS APPROPRIATE AND

02:44:12.809 --> 02:44:13.610
NECESSARY. I ALSO THINK WE NEED

02:44:13.677 --> 02:44:14.544
TO BE NOT MOVING TOWARDS

02:44:14.611 --> 02:44:17.080
PAYMENT REFORM FOR FQHCS I KNOW

02:44:17.147 --> 02:44:19.216
ANY TRANSITION IS HARD. BUT

02:44:19.282 --> 02:44:20.450
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BANDAGES

02:44:20.517 --> 02:44:22.185
TO AN ALTERNATIVE PATH PAYMENT

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.588
METHOD METHODOLOGY- AND NOT

02:44:24.654 --> 02:44:26.523
JUST FOR TELEPHONE VISITS-

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:27.958
PAYMENT REFORM IS NOT JUST

02:44:28.024 --> 02:44:28.992
ABOUT COVERAGE FOR TELEPHONE

02:44:29.059 --> 02:44:30.860
CALLS. IT WILL ENABLE AN ABLE

02:44:30.927 --> 02:44:33.296
ADVOCATE SEES TO- BE ABLE TO

02:44:33.363 --> 02:44:34.698

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:35.665

02:44:35.732 --> 02:44:36.800
BEEN FIGHTING FOR IN THIS

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:39.469

THE THAT SIDE OF AUDIO-

02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:27.517
TELEPHONES NON SMARTPHONES NOT

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:30.853
EVERYBODY IS A QUIPPED STILL IN

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:31.487
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S

02:50:31.554 --> 02:50:34.123
AREAS. THAT STILL DON'T HAVE

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:36.059
TELEPHONE LINES RUNNING TO THEM

02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:38.027
SO WE'RE NOT AS FAR YOU BOB AS

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:39.495
WE THINK AND THE MORE THAT WE

02:50:39.562 --> 02:50:40.897
MOVE FORWARD AND FAILED TO

02:50:40.964 --> 02:50:43.132
ADDRESS THOSE AREAS. BECOMES

02:50:43.199 --> 02:50:45.234
EVEN MORE GREATER CONCERN. BUT

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.971
I DO HAVE A QUESTION AS FAR AS

02:50:48.037 --> 02:50:49.906
THE- MINIMIZING OF

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:52.008
REIMBURSEMENTS DO WE HAVE ANY

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:54.043
STATISTICS DO WE HAVE ANY DATA.

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:56.346
THAT SHOWS THAT WE LOWER THOSE

02:50:56.412 --> 02:50:58.247
REIMBURSEMENT COST WHAT WILL

02:50:58.314 --> 02:51:00.850
THAT EFFECT BE ON THE PROVIDING

02:51:00.917 --> 02:51:02.785
OF THE HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE-

02:51:02.852 --> 02:51:04.454
UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:05.755
THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:07.223
GET THOSE SERVICES THERE. WELL

02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:08.925
NOW WE LOWER THOSE THOSE

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:10.827
REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENTS WILL

02:51:10.893 --> 02:51:13.363
THERE BE EVEN HARDER FOR THOSE

02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:15.031
TO GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED

02:51:15.098 --> 02:51:17.967
WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:19.369
HAVE JUST ADDRESSED. MISS

02:51:19.435 --> 02:51:20.503
COOPER I BELIEVE THE QUESTION

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:27.176
WAS ADDRESSED TO YOU. SO I JUST

02:51:27.243 --> 02:51:29.145
WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS

02:51:29.212 --> 02:51:30.880
TRACKING FOR THE VARIOUS PARTS

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:32.382

02:51:43.259 --> 02:51:44.360
WERE DOING EVEN BEYOND WHAT WE

02:51:44.427 --> 02:51:45.695
ARE PROVIDING AND PUBLIC HEALTH

02:51:45.762 --> 02:51:46.596
EMERGENCY AND I JUST THINK

02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:48.564
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

02:51:48.631 --> 02:51:49.065

COMMENTS THAT TELEHEALTH HAS

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:25.054
BEEN AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:26.355
LIFELINE DURING THIS PANDEMIC

02:54:26.422 --> 02:54:28.858
AND- ALSO SHARE THE CONCERNS

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:31.194
THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US HAS

02:54:31.260 --> 02:54:32.929
THE- POTENTIAL TO DRIVE

02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:34.964
STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES THAT ARE

02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:37.333
CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM. AND

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:39.368
I'M GROUNDING MYSELF AND SURE

02:54:39.435 --> 02:54:41.103
ON WHICH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

02:54:41.170 --> 02:54:43.506
TODAY. AND REMINDING MYSELF OF

02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:45.875
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY AND HOW

02:54:45.942 --> 02:54:48.444
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM. IN A

02:54:48.511 --> 02:54:50.112
POOR CITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:54:50.179 --> 02:54:52.048
ACCESS TO BOTH INTERNET OR

02:54:52.114 --> 02:54:54.617
SMARTPHONES AND- THE STRUGGLE

02:54:54.684 --> 02:54:56.385
THAT THAT COMMUNITY WILL HAVE

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:58.120
WITH THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL.

02:54:58.187 --> 02:55:00.723
THAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:02.291
FROM YOU IF I CAN. THAT IT

02:55:02.358 --> 02:55:04.560
SEEMED AS IF YOUR COMMENT WAS

02:55:04.627 --> 02:55:05.328
THAT WE NEEDED A LOWER

02:55:05.394 --> 02:55:07.363
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR AUDIO

02:55:07.430 --> 02:55:10.132
VERSUS VIDEO AND IN PERSON. AND

02:55:10.199 --> 02:55:12.969
YOUR CURRENT STRATEGY HAS BEEN

02:55:13.035 --> 02:55:16.138
TO. PENALIZE THOSE WHO ARE ON

02:55:16.205 --> 02:55:18.774
THE TELEPHONE. RATHER THAN TO

02:55:18.841 --> 02:55:21.244
INCENTIVIZE. THOSE WHO ARE

02:55:21.310 --> 02:55:23.346
DOING IN PERSON OR VIDEO. AND

02:55:23.412 --> 02:55:25.281
I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:28.818
COMMENT ON THAT. FROM WHAT I

02:55:28.885 --> 02:55:29.685
WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T BE IT

02:55:29.752 --> 02:55:32.521
ADDS. UP YOU KNOW I THINK THEM

02:55:32.588 --> 02:55:35.424
FOR AUDIO ONLY- BY ACKNOWLEDGE

02:55:35.491 --> 02:55:37.126
THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.395
EARLIER BY A FEMALE IN REGARDS

02:55:39.462 --> 02:55:40.963
TO BETTER CALIBRATE. BUT I

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.832
WOULD SAY IS THAT IN HEALTHCARE

02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:44.033
REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES IS

02:55:44.100 --> 02:55:45.401
REFLECTIVE OF COSTS WHICH IS

02:55:45.468 --> 02:55:47.303
WHY WE PAY MORE FOR A HOSPITAL

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:48.571
BED THAT THAT WE DO FOR AN

02:55:48.638 --> 02:55:50.206
OUTPATIENT VISIT. AND WE

02:55:50.273 --> 02:55:50.973
STRONGLY FELT THAT

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:53.009
REIMBURSEMENT SHOULD REFLECT

02:55:53.075 --> 02:55:55.011
THE OVERALL TYPE OF SERVICE AND

02:55:55.077 --> 02:55:56.012
COST OF THE SERVICE BEING

02:55:56.078 --> 02:55:57.947
PROVIDED WHICH IS WHY WE ARE

02:55:58.014 --> 02:55:59.982
ALIGNING OUR PROPOSAL- TO

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:01.784
SERVICES IN THAT WAY- AND THAT

02:56:01.851 --> 02:56:03.119
IS THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW

02:56:03.185 --> 02:56:06.055
CURRENT PROPOSAL- AND WE

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:08.190
UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE THAT IT

02:56:08.257 --> 02:56:10.159
BRINGS WHICH IS WHY WE INCLUDED

02:56:10.226 --> 02:56:11.394
IT IN THE PROPOSAL AND IT'S

02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.595
ALSO WHY WE'RE WILLING TO

02:56:12.662 --> 02:56:13.729
ENGAGE WITH A FEW ISSUES IN

02:56:13.796 --> 02:56:15.698
REGARDS TO. WHAT WE CAN GET

02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:17.600
THAT MOVING FORWARD- WITH THE

02:56:17.667 --> 02:56:19.168
RATE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

02:56:19.235 --> 02:56:21.103
DO IT NOW MIND YOU WE LACK SOME

02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:23.439
OF THE- I'M CONCERNED CMS HAS

02:56:23.506 --> 02:56:24.941
IN REGARDS TO THAT BECAUSE OF

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:26.509
FEDERAL REGULATIONS. BUT I

02:56:26.575 --> 02:56:28.010
THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS FULLY

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:29.245
COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE

02:56:29.312 --> 02:56:31.280
HAVE A BROAD ACCESS TO

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.548
TELEHEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING

02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:34.283
AUDIO ONLY IN THE FUTURE WHEN

02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:36.352
APPROPRIATE. BUT I WOULD ALSO

02:56:36.419 --> 02:56:37.720
RAISE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD

02:56:37.787 --> 02:56:39.555
PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:56:39.622 --> 02:56:40.523
US AROUND EQUITY FROM THE OTHER

02:56:40.589 --> 02:56:42.358
SIDE. MAKING SURE THAT ALL

02:56:42.425 --> 02:56:43.859
INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO IN

02:56:43.926 --> 02:56:45.861
PERSON CARE AND FOR QUALITY

02:56:45.928 --> 02:56:47.797
CARE OF AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:56:47.863 --> 02:56:49.165
BALANCE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

02:56:49.231 --> 02:56:50.933
WITH ALL OF THIS AND I THINK.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:52.835
EARLIER DAVID SAID IT WELL IT'S

02:56:52.902 --> 02:56:54.870
ABOUT THAT FORMULA WHEN IN

02:56:54.937 --> 02:56:56.706
PERSON VERSUS AUDIO ONLY IS

02:56:56.772 --> 02:56:57.873
AVAILABLE OF COURSE DURING THE

02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.508
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SOME

02:56:59.575 --> 02:57:01.477
PLACES ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:02.812
AUDIO ONLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

02:57:02.878 --> 02:57:04.146
HAVE TELEHEALTH EQUIPMENT AND

02:57:04.213 --> 02:57:06.115
OFFICES WERE CLOSED AND THAT

02:57:06.182 --> 02:57:07.817
WAS APPROPRIATE DURING. A

02:57:07.883 --> 02:57:09.352

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:30.366
EDUCATION SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE

02:58:30.433 --> 02:58:32.268
PROVIDING. SERVICES JUST

02:58:32.334 --> 02:58:34.303
BECAUSE WE WERE PROVIDING ZOOM

02:58:34.370 --> 02:58:35.738
AS EDUCATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:58:35.805 --> 02:58:37.306
THE TEACHERS WERE PAID IN THE

02:58:37.373 --> 02:58:38.674
LAST TEN IN THIS CASE JUST

02:58:38.741 --> 02:58:40.643
BECAUSE WITH THE DOCTORS WERE

02:58:40.709 --> 02:58:42.211
PROVIDING SERVICES OVER THE

02:58:42.278 --> 02:58:43.279
PHONE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

02:58:43.345 --> 02:58:44.113
DOCTORS WERE ANY LESS

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:46.248
QUALIFIED. OVER THE PHONE THAN

02:58:46.315 --> 02:58:47.383
THEY ARE IN PERSON SO I REALLY

02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:48.250
DON'T UNDERSTAND THOSE

02:58:48.317 --> 02:58:50.419
COMMENTS- YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING

02:58:50.486 --> 02:58:53.255
WE SHOULD BE- YOU KNOW.

02:58:53.322 --> 02:58:55.157
CELEBRATING BECAUSE THAT WE ALL

02:58:55.224 --> 02:58:57.026
KNOW THAT AFTER THIS PANDEMIC

02:58:57.093 --> 02:58:58.127
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SHORT A

02:58:58.194 --> 02:58:59.528
SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE

02:58:59.595 --> 02:59:01.130
PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS

02:59:01.197 --> 02:59:03.332
HAPPENING SO AGAIN I DON'T

02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:04.834
UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO COMMENTS

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:06.969
AND- FIRST HOW IS IT THAT. BY

02:59:07.036 --> 02:59:10.306
PROVIDING- OF PHONE- SERVICES

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:12.141
DECREASES THAT SERVICES FOR

02:59:12.208 --> 02:59:14.877
THOSE IN PERSON SERVICES- AND

02:59:14.944 --> 02:59:16.645
SO I MEAN AGAIN YOU KNOW I

02:59:16.712 --> 02:59:17.346
THINK WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE ALL

02:59:17.413 --> 02:59:19.215
LOOKING FOR EQUITY AND IF

02:59:19.281 --> 02:59:21.183
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I DON'T SEE

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:23.619
HOW IT'S VALID- ESPECIALLY

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.354
WHEN. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO

02:59:25.421 --> 02:59:26.222

02:59:26.288 --> 02:59:27.656
WHAT WE HAVE IN AGAIN FOR THE

02:59:27.723 --> 02:59:31.260
PROVIDERS DOING. TELEPHONE

02:59:31.327 --> 02:59:32.495
PROVIDING SERVICES BY TELEPHONE

02:59:32.561 --> 02:59:35.131
DOESN'T DIMINISH DIMINISH IN

02:59:35.197 --> 02:59:36.165
THE M. THE SERVICE IN MY

02:59:36.232 --> 02:59:38.801
OPINION IT DIDN'T DIMINISH IT-

02:59:38.868 --> 02:59:40.302
FOR TEACHERS AND YES WE ALL HAD

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:42.872
PROBLEMS- YOU KNOW TRYING TO

02:59:42.938 --> 02:59:45.141
FIGURE IT OUT. BUT THE TEACHERS

02:59:45.207 --> 02:59:46.308
ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAID LESS

02:59:46.375 --> 02:59:47.843
BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING ZOOM-

02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:49.712
EDUCATION AND I DON'T BELIEVE

02:59:49.778 --> 02:59:51.080
THAT YOU KNOW THE SERVICE IS

02:59:51.147 --> 02:59:51.914
PROVIDED BY MEDICAL

02:59:51.981 --> 02:59:53.115
PROFESSIONALS SHOULD BE LAST

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:54.583
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING OVER

02:59:54.650 --> 02:59:56.185
THE PHONE SO IF YOU CAN. HELP

02:59:56.252 --> 02:59:57.486
ME UNDERSTAND THAT COMMENT

02:59:57.553 --> 03:00:02.191
ABOUT HOW. ONE BIG ONE

03:00:02.258 --> 03:00:03.792
DECREASES THE OTHER. CHART BE

03:00:03.859 --> 03:00:04.260
TO. SO I THINK WHAT I

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:05.261
MENTIONING IS THAT THERE ARE

03:00:05.327 --> 03:00:06.228
CERTAIN VISITS ADMISSION BY

03:00:06.295 --> 03:00:08.364
MANY OF THE SPEAKERS PREVIOUS

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:10.633
TO ME- AT THAT SHOULD BE DONE

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:12.034
IN PERSON. RESIDENTS ARE YOU

03:00:12.101 --> 03:00:13.269

COMMENTS THERE IS. A PERFECT

03:00:15.237 --> 03:00:17.206
ROLE FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES I

03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:19.008
THINK PART OF THE CARE BEING

03:00:19.074 --> 03:00:21.010
PROVIDED TO SOMEBODY. OF THAT

03:00:21.076 --> 03:00:22.511
THERE ARE VISITS THAT DO NEED

03:00:22.578 --> 03:00:24.413
TO TAKE PLACE IN PERSON-

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.048
ADDRESS MENTIONED BY BY MANY

03:00:26.115 --> 03:00:28.317
SPEAKERS AND MOST PHYSICIANS IN

03:00:28.384 --> 03:00:29.518
REGARDS TO WHEN THEY'RE

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:30.753
PRESENTING THIS PIECE AND SO.

03:00:30.819 --> 03:00:32.388
THAT'S WHAT MY COMMENT WAS IN

03:00:32.454 --> 03:00:33.355
REGARDS I CAN GIVE YOU SOME

03:00:33.422 --> 03:00:34.957
EXAMPLES. DURING THE PUBLIC

03:00:35.024 --> 03:00:37.259
HEALTH EMERGENCY MAJORITY OF-

03:00:37.326 --> 03:00:39.161
VISITS WERE BEING PROVIDED VIA

03:00:39.228 --> 03:00:41.063
EITHER TELEHEALTH IN ORDER

03:00:41.130 --> 03:00:42.598
AUDIO ONLY VISIT. HOWEVER WE

03:00:42.665 --> 03:00:44.400
HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:45.568
REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF

03:00:45.634 --> 03:00:46.101
CHILDREN RECEIVING

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:48.404
IMMUNIZATIONS- DURING THE LAST

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.105
YEAR WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DIP

03:00:50.172 --> 03:00:51.640
DECREASE. IN REGARDS TO THE

03:00:51.707 --> 03:00:53.576
NUMBER OF CHILDREN- WHO WERE

03:00:53.642 --> 03:00:55.010
GETTING THEIR WELL CHILD VISITS

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:56.679
WHICH REQUIRE CERTAIN PIECES.

03:00:56.745 --> 03:00:58.514
OF THOSE VISITS THE IN PERSON

03:00:58.581 --> 03:01:00.082
SO MY COMMENTS WERE REALLY MORE

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:02.017
AROUND THE FORMULA AND I FEED

03:01:02.084 --> 03:01:04.186
BY THAT I MEAN A COMBINATION

03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:06.388
OF. IN PERSON VISITS AND AUDIO

03:01:06.455 --> 03:01:08.357
ONLY BEING AVAILABLE TO

03:01:08.424 --> 03:01:09.959
INDIVIDUALS AS THERE'S A CLEAR

03:01:10.025 --> 03:01:11.760
NEED. TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS

03:01:11.827 --> 03:01:13.229
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THEIR

03:01:13.295 --> 03:01:14.964
PROVIDER IN PERSON. AND TO BE

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.998
ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE TYPES

03:01:16.065 --> 03:01:17.700
OF CARE THAT CAN'T BE PROVIDED

03:01:17.766 --> 03:01:19.535
VIA AUDIO ONLY. VERY

03:01:19.602 --> 03:01:20.836
UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT THAT

03:01:20.903 --> 03:01:22.204
IT IS ALSO COMPLEMENTARY FOM

03:01:22.271 --> 03:01:23.739
AN ACCESS POINT BUT IT'S

03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:24.907
DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:01:24.974 --> 03:01:26.542
CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED IN ORDER

03:01:26.609 --> 03:01:27.943
TO ENSURE THAT WE IMPROV. AND

03:01:28.010 --> 03:01:29.745
HAVE GOOD QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:31.447
CERTAIN SCREENINGS AND SERVICES

03:01:31.513 --> 03:01:32.881
THAT MEET THE NEEDS TO BE DONE

03:01:32.948 --> 03:01:34.149
IN PERSON SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT

03:01:34.216 --> 03:01:35.751
MY COMMENT WAS REGARDING. JUST

03:01:35.818 --> 03:01:37.519
MAKING SURE IT'S A PART OF THE

03:01:37.586 --> 03:01:38.854
SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BUT NOT

03:01:38.921 --> 03:01:40.756
BE ON THE MODALITIES AVAILABLE

03:01:40.823 --> 03:01:42.191
TO PEOPLE. AFFECTED BY

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:44.960
CONFLICT. WHAT ABOUT RIGHT BUT

03:01:45.027 --> 03:01:47.096
BUT I THINK THE COMMENTS- IF I.

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:47.963
MADE THE COMMENT THAT WE'RE

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:49.965
MAKING IS NOT SPECIFICALLY TO

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:52.935
PROVIDE ONLY TELEPHONIC- VISITS

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:54.536
I THINK. THIS IS WHAT WHAT

03:01:54.603 --> 03:01:55.704
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE

03:01:55.771 --> 03:01:58.540
HAVE TO HAVE. A VARIETY OF WAYS

03:01:58.607 --> 03:02:04.179
TO BE MAKE SURE THAT. SOME

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:04.747
FOLKS ACCESS AND OF COURSE I

03:02:04.813 --> 03:02:05.614
AND- THAT THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:06.548
BE. OVER THE PHONE. AND SO I

03:02:06.615 --> 03:02:07.650
DON'T. UNDERSTAND THAT COMMENT

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:10.586
EITHER- AND I DON'T THINK THAT-

03:02:10.653 --> 03:02:12.054
A PROVIDER OVER THE PHONE IS

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:14.690
GOING TO. FADE TO OUR PATIENTS-

03:02:14.757 --> 03:02:16.425
DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS AND LET'S

03:02:16.492 --> 03:02:17.893
JUST DO THIS OVER THE PHONE. SO

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.662
I DID SO JUST SO THAT WE DON'T

03:02:19.728 --> 03:02:21.897
GET INTO KIND OF THAT. BACK AND

03:02:21.964 --> 03:02:24.933
FORTH- THIS IS NOT ABOUT A GUY

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:25.968
BIG BUT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO

03:02:26.035 --> 03:02:27.002
IS MAKE SURE THAT WERE

03:02:27.069 --> 03:02:28.704
EQUITABLE IN THE SERVICE

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:29.838
PROVIDED IN SOME OF OUR

03:02:29.905 --> 03:02:33.208
COMMUNITIES ONLY HAVE. ACCESS

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:34.576
TO WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GO

03:02:34.643 --> 03:02:36.045
THEY CAN GO BUT A LOT OF TIMES

03:02:36.111 --> 03:02:37.279
ARE NOT ABLE TO GOAL THE WORK

03:02:37.346 --> 03:02:39.615
LONG HOURS. AND IF THIS IS THE

03:02:39.682 --> 03:02:40.816
WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AT

03:02:40.883 --> 03:02:44.386
LEAST- BEGIN TO OFFER SOME KIND

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:46.221
OF HEALTH. SOME SOME KIND OF-

03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:47.690
SERVICES AND I THINK THAT WE

03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:49.525
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. IT'S NOT

03:02:49.591 --> 03:02:50.926
ONE VERSUS THE OTHER AND I

03:02:50.993 --> 03:02:51.960
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

03:02:52.027 --> 03:02:53.896
A BALANCE. BUT AGAIN THE

03:02:53.962 --> 03:02:56.899
PROVIDERS ARE NOT. ANY LESS

03:02:56.965 --> 03:02:59.635
THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ANY LESS-

03:02:59.702 --> 03:03:01.603
CARE. IF THEY'RE DOING IT OVER

03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:02.171
THE PHONE AND SO FOR ME THE

03:03:02.237 --> 03:03:04.640
EQUITY IS- FOR THE COMMUNITY

03:03:04.707 --> 03:03:06.642
BUT ALSO FOR THE PROVIDERS THAT

03:03:06.709 --> 03:03:08.377
ARE. ARE ARE DOING THIS AND SO.

03:03:08.444 --> 03:03:09.812
I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS

03:03:09.878 --> 03:03:11.180
IT WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT-

03:03:11.246 --> 03:03:13.482
OF ONE VERSUS THE OTHER. AND I

03:03:13.549 --> 03:03:14.383
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD I KNOW IF

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:18.754
I. HEARD THAT INCORRECTLY- THEN

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:22.024
THEN. I THEN I YEAH I WOULD

03:03:22.091 --> 03:03:23.225
MAKE SURE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF

03:03:23.292 --> 03:03:24.593
MY COMMENTS- BUT I WITH I JUST

03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:25.461
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:03:25.527 --> 03:03:26.929
NOT IT'S NOT ONE VERSUS THE

03:03:26.995 --> 03:03:29.565
OTHER AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

03:38:54.387 --> 03:38:56.423
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO

03:38:56.490 --> 03:38:57.224
STRENGTHEN EXISTING

03:38:57.290 --> 03:38:58.959
PARTNERSHIPS BUILD UP THE

03:38:59.025 --> 03:38:59.726
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE

03:38:59.793 --> 03:39:01.862
MAKING AN ON AN ONGOING

03:39:01.928 --> 03:39:04.130
INVESTMENT IN. EXPAND ADDED WE

03:39:04.197 --> 03:39:06.132
HOPE OVER TIME WE CAN IN

03:39:06.199 --> 03:39:09.536
PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS WITH

03:39:09.603 --> 03:39:11.705
MEDICARE PLANS AND OTHERS BEGIN

03:39:11.771 --> 03:39:13.740
TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT IS

03:39:13.807 --> 03:39:15.141
REALLY DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF

03:39:15.208 --> 03:39:16.543
THE STUDENTS WERE SERVING.

03:39:16.610 --> 03:39:18.044
RATHER THAN STARTING WITH THE

03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:19.946
FUNDING THE DESIGN OF THE

03:39:20.013 --> 03:39:21.581
FUNDING THAT WE BRING TO THE

03:39:21.648 --> 03:39:24.518
TABLE. I DO WANT TO COMMENT-

03:39:24.584 --> 03:39:26.253
BASED ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

03:39:26.319 --> 03:39:27.654
IN THE ANALYSIS OR THE

03:39:27.721 --> 03:39:28.421
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:39:28.488 --> 03:39:30.824
SERVICES. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE

03:39:30.891 --> 03:39:33.260
THAT THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM

03:39:33.326 --> 03:39:34.394
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEET THE

03:39:34.461 --> 03:39:36.997
NEEDS OF OUR EARLIEST CHILDREN

03:39:37.063 --> 03:39:39.132
OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS AND SO

03:39:39.199 --> 03:39:41.401
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED IN

03:39:41.468 --> 03:39:43.303
THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:44.237
AND HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT AS

03:39:44.304 --> 03:39:46.907
WELL. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

03:39:46.973 --> 03:39:47.841
SUPPORT YOUNG CHILDREN AND

03:39:47.908 --> 03:39:49.142
THEIR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY

03:39:49.209 --> 03:39:50.710
THROUGH A PREVENTION AND EARLY

03:39:50.777 --> 03:39:52.779
INTERVENTION LANDS. AND ON AND

03:39:52.846 --> 03:39:54.247
ON THAT POINT THE SAME IS TRUE

03:39:54.314 --> 03:39:56.116
FOR HIGHER AT I WAS IN A

03:39:56.182 --> 03:39:57.450
MEETING TODAY WITH THE UC

03:39:57.517 --> 03:39:59.019
REGENTS THEY COMMENTED THAT

03:39:59.085 --> 03:40:00.921
ABOUT 10% SLIGHTLY UNDER TEN

03:40:00.987 --> 03:40:03.590
PERCENT. OF THE UC STUDENTS ARE

03:40:03.657 --> 03:40:04.891
ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. WITH

03:40:04.958 --> 03:40:07.294
ANTICIPATE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:10.263
SIZE OF THE CSU SYSTEM AND THE

03:40:10.330 --> 03:40:11.898
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:40:11.965 --> 03:40:13.133
SYSTEM THAT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD

03:40:13.199 --> 03:40:15.268
BE HIGHER IN TERMS OF A MEDIC

03:40:15.335 --> 03:40:18.405
CAL ENROLLEES- BUT I. DO WANT

03:40:18.471 --> 03:40:19.940
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

03:40:20.006 --> 03:40:22.008
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE

03:40:22.075 --> 03:40:24.811
SCHOOLS AS A PATHWAY TO SUPPORT

03:40:24.878 --> 03:40:26.947
BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS AGAIN DO

03:40:27.013 --> 03:40:27.747
A PREVENTION ANDINTERVENTION

03:40:27.814 --> 03:40:29.616
STRATEGY IS THE SAME

03:40:29.683 --> 03:40:31.451
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR EARLY

03:40:31.518 --> 03:40:33.053
LEARNERS AS WELL AS OUR HIGHER

03:40:33.119 --> 03:40:35.121
EDUCATION SYSTEMS. SO ALTHOUGH

03:40:35.188 --> 03:40:36.423
THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE AT THE

03:40:36.489 --> 03:40:37.424
MOMENT WE JUST WANT TO

03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:43.463
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE VERY.

03:40:43.530 --> 03:40:44.197
SIMILAR CONCERNS AND WE SEE.

03:40:44.264 --> 03:40:45.398
TREMENDOUS COOPER. FOR PAR BUT

03:40:45.465 --> 03:40:46.199
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:40:46.266 --> 03:40:48.468
SYSTEMS ARE COLLEGE UNIVERSITY

03:40:48.535 --> 03:40:50.770
CAMPUSES AND EARLY LEARNING

03:40:50.837 --> 03:40:52.072
OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN REALLY

03:40:52.138 --> 03:40:54.140
STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF CARE.

03:40:54.207 --> 03:40:56.042
IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN

03:40:56.109 --> 03:40:59.179
DESIGN CARE- THAT IS RESPONSIVE

03:40:59.245 --> 03:41:01.281
RESPONSIVE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN

03:41:01.348 --> 03:41:02.182
TODAY WE'RE REALLY TALKING

03:41:02.248 --> 03:41:04.351
ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE BACK IN OUR-

03:41:04.417 --> 03:41:06.519
IN OUR WORLD WE REALLY THINK

03:41:06.586 --> 03:41:08.622
ABOUT ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. IN

03:41:08.688 --> 03:41:12.859
IN TERMS OF- YEAH THE BROADER

03:41:12.926 --> 03:41:14.861
INVESTMENT AROUND MEDICAL

03:41:14.928 --> 03:41:16.162
OPPORTUNITIES THE QUESTION THAT

03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:17.497
I WAS ASKED IS WHAT ELSE WHAT

03:41:17.564 --> 03:41:19.566
ELSE COULD WE BE DOING HERE-

03:41:19.633 --> 03:41:20.600
CHILDREN HAVE A VERY

03:41:20.667 --> 03:41:22.135
SIGNIFICANT ENTITLEMENT UNDER

03:41:22.202 --> 03:41:23.436
MEDICARE FOR SCREENING

03:41:23.503 --> 03:41:25.338
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT AND WE

03:41:25.405 --> 03:41:27.941
TALKED DURING THE EARLIER ITEM

03:41:28.008 --> 03:41:30.076
AROUND BETTER USING DATA IN

03:41:30.143 --> 03:41:31.911
PROCESS AYE PREVENTION THIS IS

03:41:31.978 --> 03:41:33.947
AN AREA WHERE WE ALSO NEED TO

03:41:34.014 --> 03:41:35.949
BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW WHAT

03:41:36.016 --> 03:41:36.983
KIND OF INFORMATION IS

03:41:37.050 --> 03:41:39.085
AVAILABLE AROUND WHO IS

03:41:39.152 --> 03:41:40.754
ACCESSING CARE WHO'S NOT

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:43.523
ACCESSING CARE AND THE GAP

03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:44.090
FIFTY THIRTY IN OUR SERVICE

03:41:44.157 --> 03:41:45.659
DELIVERY SYSTEM IT WOULD BE

03:41:45.725 --> 03:41:48.328
VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:41:48.395 --> 03:41:49.963
NEEDS ARE OUT THERE WHAT NEEDS

03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:51.531
ARE BEING MET SO THAT WE CAN

03:41:51.598 --> 03:41:52.432
BEGIN TO PUT IN PLACE A

03:41:52.499 --> 03:41:55.869
STRATEGY TO CLOSE THAT GAP. M.

03:41:55.935 --> 03:41:57.804
WE WANT THAT TO BE DONE THROUGH

03:41:57.871 --> 03:42:00.006
AN UPSTREAM PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL

03:42:00.073 --> 03:42:03.176
PREVENTION STRATEGY AS WE CAN

03:42:03.243 --> 03:42:03.743
IMAGINE. THAT REALLY WOULD

03:42:03.810 --> 03:42:05.578
ALLOW US TO BOTH IF WE

03:42:05.645 --> 03:42:07.547
UNDERSTOOD THOSE GAPS IF WE

03:42:07.614 --> 03:42:09.049
UNDERSTOOD THE PATHWAYS THAT

03:42:09.115 --> 03:42:11.551
PEOPLE ARE PURSUING TO SEE CARE

03:42:11.618 --> 03:42:12.786
IT WOULD ALLOW US TO STRENGTHEN

03:42:12.852 --> 03:42:14.854
OUR MEDIC CAL. IN RELATED

03:42:14.921 --> 03:42:17.524
ACCESS STRATEGIES. ONE OF THE

03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:19.559
QUESTIONS IN THE ANALYSIS FOR

03:42:19.626 --> 03:42:22.729
MANY YEARS AROUND MOBILE AND

03:42:22.796 --> 03:42:24.998
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND MOBILE. I

03:42:25.065 --> 03:42:26.833
THINK YOU KNOW IN OUR SOCIETY

03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:29.536
WE HAVE MOVED TOWARDS MOBILE

03:42:29.602 --> 03:42:30.570
BUT WE ALSO MOVE TOWARDS

03:42:30.637 --> 03:42:32.072
DIGITAL ART AS PART OF THE

03:42:32.138 --> 03:42:33.006
CONVERSATION YOU HAD EARLIER

03:42:33.073 --> 03:42:34.541
TODAY AROUND REIMBURSEMENTS FOR

03:42:34.607 --> 03:42:37.744
VIRTUAL CARE. AND I THINK THE

03:42:37.811 --> 03:42:39.312
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS NOT

03:42:39.379 --> 03:42:41.147
BEEN AS NIMBLE IN MOVING

03:42:41.214 --> 03:42:43.049
TOWARDS MOBILE AND VIRTUAL AS

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:44.918
WE COULD BE I THINK THAT'S TRUE

03:42:44.984 --> 03:42:46.686
ACROSS EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE

03:42:46.753 --> 03:42:48.855
DOING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR NOT

03:42:48.922 --> 03:42:50.690
NOT UNIQUE TO HEALTHCARE IN

03:42:50.757 --> 03:42:51.624
SOME WAYS IT'S MUCH MORE

03:42:51.691 --> 03:42:53.893
DIFFICULT AND HEALTH CARE AS

03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:56.596
EVIDENCED BY THE CONVERSATIONS

03:42:56.663 --> 03:42:58.231
YOU HAD. EARLIER IN THE AGENDA.

03:42:58.298 --> 03:42:59.232
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

03:42:59.299 --> 03:43:00.900
REALLY ARE EXCITED ABOUT IN

03:43:00.967 --> 03:43:02.435
TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS

03:43:02.502 --> 03:43:04.304
MOBILE BASED CARE. AND WE WOULD

03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:06.272
ARGUE THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR

03:43:06.339 --> 03:43:08.007
CRISIS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE

03:43:08.074 --> 03:43:10.210
LIMITED TO CRISIS RESPONSE

03:43:10.276 --> 03:43:12.278
PARTICULARLY. IF WE WANT TO

03:43:12.345 --> 03:43:14.547
ADDRESS ACCESS CHALLENGES IF WE

03:43:14.614 --> 03:43:17.550
WAT TO ADDRESS INEQUITY ISSUES

03:43:17.617 --> 03:43:19.519
OR DISPARITIES ISSUES. MOBILE

03:43:19.586 --> 03:43:21.888
ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY RESPOND

03:43:21.955 --> 03:43:22.722
THE NEEDS WITHIN INDIVIDUALS

03:43:22.789 --> 03:43:24.991
WERE SERVING RATHER THAN ASKING

03:43:25.058 --> 03:43:27.794
PEOPLE TO ADAPT THERE NEEDS TO

03:43:27.861 --> 03:43:30.230
THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. AND SO

03:43:30.296 --> 03:43:31.631
WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE STATE

03:43:31.698 --> 03:43:32.632
WOULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT

03:43:32.699 --> 03:43:33.600
INVESTMENTS IN MOBILE

03:43:33.666 --> 03:43:35.535
STRATEGIES IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH

03:43:35.602 --> 03:43:39.038
pIS THAT ARE ALREADY MOVING IN

03:43:39.105 --> 03:43:40.974
THIS DIRECTION. SO WE THINK

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:43.209
THIS SHIFT TOWARDS MOBILE IS

03:43:43.276 --> 03:43:43.843
IMPORTANT NEEDS TO BE AN

03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:45.812
IMPORTANT ELEMENT. OF A BROADER

03:43:45.879 --> 03:43:48.848
CONVERSATION AROUND HOW WE CAN

03:43:48.915 --> 03:43:52.385
BETTER RESPOND. TO THE NEEDS

03:43:52.452 --> 03:43:53.887
ACROSS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT

03:43:53.953 --> 03:43:55.421
TURNS OUT THAT THE

03:43:55.488 --> 03:43:57.223
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE BROADER

03:43:57.290 --> 03:43:58.558
COMMENT ABOUT WHAT OF THESE

03:43:58.625 --> 03:44:00.493
OPPORTUNITIES HERE I JUST WANT

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:02.495
TO ADD A COUPLE OF. POINTS FOR

03:44:02.562 --> 03:44:05.465
YOUR CONSIDERATION ONE IS- IN

03:44:05.532 --> 03:44:07.200
TERMS OF THE STATE'S ABILITY TO

03:44:07.267 --> 03:44:09.235
RAPIDLY RESPOND TO THE

03:44:09.302 --> 03:44:10.403
CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING

03:44:10.470 --> 03:44:12.005
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

03:44:12.071 --> 03:44:13.840
OF THE PANDEMIC AND ALL OF ITS

03:44:13.907 --> 03:44:16.209
RELATED. ISSUES IS THE MEDICAL

03:44:16.276 --> 03:44:18.912
SERVICES STUDENT SERVICES ACT

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:20.780
INCLUDES TWENTY COUNTIES THAT

03:44:20.847 --> 03:44:22.549
ARE WHAT WE CALL SHOVEL READY.

03:44:22.615 --> 03:44:24.417
THEY'RE READY TO GO. WE WERE

03:44:24.484 --> 03:44:25.985
NOT ABLE TO FIND THEM BECAUSE

03:44:26.052 --> 03:44:27.654
LIMITS IN THE ALLOCATION OF THE

03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:29.489
COMMISSION RECEIVED. WE ARE

03:44:29.556 --> 03:44:31.224
COMMITTED TO BE ABLE TO PUSH

03:44:31.291 --> 03:44:32.058
THOSE DOLLARS OUT IN SIXTY DAYS

03:44:32.125 --> 03:44:33.660
OR LESS TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:44:33.726 --> 03:44:35.128
COUNTIES CAN RECEIVE THEM THAT

03:44:35.195 --> 03:44:36.596
BATH WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT

03:44:36.663 --> 03:44:38.331
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN.

03:44:38.398 --> 03:44:39.766
THAT COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO

03:44:39.833 --> 03:44:41.801
DEVELOP SCHOOL BASED STRATEGIES

03:44:41.868 --> 03:44:44.170
IN TIME FOR THE BEGINNING OF

03:44:44.237 --> 03:44:46.739
THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IN THE

03:44:46.806 --> 03:44:48.274
FALL. BUT IT MEANS THAT WE

03:44:48.341 --> 03:44:49.375
WOULD AT LEAST HAVE AN

03:44:49.442 --> 03:44:52.412
OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTY SCHOOL

03:44:52.478 --> 03:44:54.380
PARTNERSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO.

03:45:02.121 --> 03:45:04.023
BE IN TECH ASSIST WILL BE.

03:45:04.090 --> 03:45:06.326
IMPORTANT IN THIS EFFORT SO

03:45:06.392 --> 03:45:08.061
THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE

03:45:08.127 --> 03:45:09.796
LEARNING THAT THAT SCHOOLS AND

03:45:09.863 --> 03:45:11.865
COUNTIES AND I WOULD ADD WE

03:45:11.931 --> 03:45:13.499
HOPE MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL GO

03:45:13.566 --> 03:45:15.301
THROUGH AS THEY BEGIN. TO BUILD

03:45:15.368 --> 03:45:16.970
OUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS. AND

03:45:17.036 --> 03:45:19.138
SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA HAS MADE

03:45:19.205 --> 03:45:20.907
TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN BUILDING

03:45:20.974 --> 03:45:22.575
OUT THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE

03:45:22.642 --> 03:45:24.510
SYSTEM WHICH IS A MOBILE SYSTEM

03:45:24.577 --> 03:45:25.979
TO RESPOND. TO CHILDREN

03:45:26.045 --> 03:45:27.213
INVOLVED WITH THE CHILD WELFARE

03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:28.248
SYSTEM WE THINK THAT THAT'S A

03:45:28.314 --> 03:45:30.283
MODEL. THAT THE STATE SHOULD

03:45:30.350 --> 03:45:32.552
LOOK AT A BUILDING UPON THEM

03:45:32.619 --> 03:45:33.553
FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN

03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:35.788
BECAUSE IT'S AVAILABLE. AND IT

03:45:35.855 --> 03:45:37.257
WOULD ALLOW US TO RAMP UP

03:45:37.323 --> 03:45:40.727
RELATIVELY QUICKLY RELATIVE TO

03:45:40.793 --> 03:45:41.294
OTHER KINDS OF APPROACHES.

03:45:41.361 --> 03:45:42.495
THERE ARE OTHER MODELS OUT

THERE WE ARE COUNTIES HAVE

03:45:44.330 --> 03:45:46.232
REALLY BEEN LEADING THE WAY. IN

ACCESS TO SERVICES AND THAT IS

04:08:02.300 --> 04:08:03.401
ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF WHAT

04:08:03.468 --> 04:08:04.102
WE'RE HOPING THIS INVESTMENT

04:08:04.169 --> 04:08:07.005

QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO

04:08:15.547 --> 04:08:16.982

04:08:17.048 --> 04:08:18.883
IN THAT CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN

04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:21.586
HAVING THE LAST FEW YEARS- YOU

04:08:21.653 --> 04:08:22.821
KNOW I AM SURE THAT THE

04:08:22.887 --> 04:08:25.457
COMMISSION STRATEGY PART OF OUR

04:08:25.523 --> 04:08:26.091
OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY

04:08:26.157 --> 04:08:29.828
STRATEGY. IS TO HAVE A CLEAR

04:08:29.894 --> 04:08:32.297
AND UNDERSTANDABLE WAY TO

04:08:32.364 --> 04:08:35.467
REFLECT FIRST SPENDING YOUR THE

04:08:35.533 --> 04:08:36.668
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING

04:08:36.735 --> 04:08:38.203
AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

04:08:38.270 --> 04:08:39.104
FOR THE ENTIRE MENTAL HEALTH

04:08:39.170 --> 04:08:40.739
SYSTEM. THE COMMISSION AND

04:08:40.805 --> 04:08:41.706
START WITH THEM AND TO SAY

04:08:41.773 --> 04:08:44.009
FUNDS BAD PART OF OUR STRATEGY

04:08:44.075 --> 04:08:45.977
IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF W WANT

04:08:46.044 --> 04:08:47.812
TO UNDERSTAND THE BROADER

04:08:47.879 --> 04:08:49.714
PUBLIC INVESTMENT WE NEED TO

04:08:49.781 --> 04:08:51.316
PUT SOME NUMBERS OUT THERE AND

04:08:51.383 --> 04:08:53.918
MONITOR THOSE. THE SECOND PIECE

04:08:53.985 --> 04:08:56.087
IS IN THIS GETS TO PREVENT

04:08:56.154 --> 04:08:57.389
FRAZIER COMMENT HERE'S WHAT WE

04:08:57.455 --> 04:08:59.057
SPENDING THESE DOLLARS ON AND

04:08:59.124 --> 04:09:00.358
SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO

04:09:00.425 --> 04:09:02.527
REFLECT. THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

04:09:02.594 --> 04:09:08.099
BEING FUNDED WITH. THE DOLLARS

04:09:08.166 --> 04:09:09.234
THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE. FROM

04:09:09.301 --> 04:09:10.402
FROM OUR TAX PAYER. AND THE

04:09:10.468 --> 04:09:11.603
THIRD. OF THAT DISCUSSION IS

04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:12.837
WHAT OUTCOMES BEING AND- THIS

04:09:12.904 --> 04:09:15.807
IS A M. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

04:09:15.874 --> 04:09:17.275
DO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WE

04:09:17.342 --> 04:09:19.311
DON'T HAVE GOOD MODELS. IN THE

04:09:19.377 --> 04:09:21.613
PUBLIC SECTOR IN SOME WAYS WE

04:09:21.680 --> 04:09:22.981
HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS IN

04:09:23.048 --> 04:09:24.916
MENTAL HEALTH. AND IT'S TRUE IN

04:09:24.983 --> 04:09:28.320
OTHER SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA OR

04:09:28.386 --> 04:09:29.554
ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

04:09:29.621 --> 04:09:31.456
WE CAN'T. WITH IN A VERY

04:09:31.523 --> 04:09:34.259
LIMITED STANDS. POINT OUT THAT

04:09:34.326 --> 04:09:36.227
WE CAN WE CAN SHOW THAT FOR

04:09:36.294 --> 04:09:37.662
BOTH SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT

04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:39.731
ARE SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO

04:09:39.798 --> 04:09:41.666
HAVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE HISTORY.

04:09:41.733 --> 04:09:43.568
THAT WHEN THEY ENTER THESE

04:09:43.635 --> 04:09:46.705
PROGRAMS. AND UPON GRADUATION

04:09:46.771 --> 04:09:48.840
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE.

04:09:48.907 --> 04:09:51.710
IN RE ARREST RATES AND EVEN

04:09:51.776 --> 04:09:53.311
OVER TIME AS PEOPLE LEAVE THESE

04:09:53.378 --> 04:09:55.180
PROGRAMS WILL WE SEE A

04:09:55.246 --> 04:09:57.682
REDUCTION AS HIGH AS 69% 59%

04:09:57.749 --> 04:09:58.883
REDUCTION CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:09:58.950 --> 04:10:00.418
INVOLVEMENT. FOLLOWING

04:10:00.485 --> 04:10:01.319
PARTICIPATION IN THESE

04:10:01.386 --> 04:10:03.188
PROGRAMS. PART OF THE REASON

04:10:03.254 --> 04:10:05.323
THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT

04:10:05.390 --> 04:10:06.191
THE VALUE A FULL SERVICE

04:10:06.257 --> 04:10:08.693
PARTNERSHIP. FIRST AND OVER

04:10:08.760 --> 04:10:10.095
NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT

04:10:10.161 --> 04:10:12.497
IS A TREMENDOUS INVESTMENT THAT

04:10:12.564 --> 04:10:14.366
IS THAT WE ARE MAKING ANNUALLY.

04:10:14.432 --> 04:10:15.333
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

04:10:15.400 --> 04:10:16.968
INVESTMENT IS HAVING THE IMPACT

04:10:17.035 --> 04:10:18.603
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WE

04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:21.239
DON'T KNOW I'M A LITTLE IN THE

04:10:21.306 --> 04:10:23.108
DATA THAT I JUST SHARED ABOUT

04:10:23.174 --> 04:10:24.576
HOW FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS

04:10:24.642 --> 04:10:25.977
ARE HELPING PEOPLE AVOID THE

04:10:26.044 --> 04:10:27.679
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ONE OF

04:10:27.746 --> 04:10:29.581
THE THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

04:10:29.647 --> 04:10:31.850
WHICH WE THINK IS ESSENTIAL.

04:10:31.916 --> 04:10:33.985
FOR IN CALIFORNIA IS WHAT IS

04:10:34.052 --> 04:10:35.920
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

04:10:35.987 --> 04:10:37.355
PARTICIPATION IN A FULL SERVICE

04:10:37.422 --> 04:10:38.757
PARTNERSHIP OR LACK OF

04:10:38.823 --> 04:10:41.292
PARTICIPATION IN THE LIKELIHOOD

04:10:41.359 --> 04:10:43.728
THAT SOMEONE BECOMES. ENOUGH

04:10:43.795 --> 04:10:45.230
LANDS IN THE STATE HOSPITAL

04:10:45.296 --> 04:10:46.698
WITH AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND

04:10:46.765 --> 04:10:47.766
TRIAL DESIGNATION BECAUSE OF A

04:10:47.832 --> 04:10:49.734
FELONY CHARGE. WE NEED TO

04:10:49.801 --> 04:10:50.969
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

04:10:51.035 --> 04:10:53.838
TRAJECTORY OF HOW PEOPLE WHO DO

04:10:53.905 --> 04:10:56.207
OR DO NOT RECEIVE A SET A RANGE

04:10:56.274 --> 04:10:58.576
OF SERVICES. END UP IN A VERY

04:10:58.643 --> 04:11:00.678
EXPENSIVE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM

04:11:00.745 --> 04:11:01.980
OR THEY AVOID THAT VERY

04:11:02.046 --> 04:11:03.648
EXPENSIVE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM.

04:11:03.715 --> 04:11:04.849
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

04:11:04.916 --> 04:11:06.518
RELATIONSHIP THE COMMISSION HAS

04:11:06.584 --> 04:11:11.689
BEEN WORKING TO BUILD. OUT

04:11:11.756 --> 04:11:12.323
EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMMING. WE

04:11:12.390 --> 04:11:12.824
WANT TO WRECK. THAT THE

04:11:12.891 --> 04:11:14.392
GENERATE BE AVERAGE DURATION OF

04:11:14.459 --> 04:11:15.660
UNFIT PSYCHOSIS IN THE UNITED

04:11:15.727 --> 04:11:17.695
STATES. IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN

04:11:17.762 --> 04:11:19.130
MONTHS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

04:11:19.197 --> 04:11:19.798
THE DATA FOR SPECIFIC TO

04:11:19.864 --> 04:11:22.634
CALIFORNIA. AND THE NATIONAL

04:11:22.700 --> 04:11:25.170
STANDARDS. INDICATE THAT THAT

04:11:25.236 --> 04:11:26.538
REALLY SHOULD BE TWO TO FOUR

04:11:26.604 --> 04:11:28.907
WEEKS. IN THE UK STANDARD IS

04:11:28.973 --> 04:11:31.176
TWO WEEKS. AND SO WE WANT TO

04:11:31.242 --> 04:11:34.145
UNDERSTAND IF WE IMPROVE ACCESS

04:11:34.212 --> 04:11:36.815
EARLY ACCESS TO. PSYCHOSIS

04:11:36.881 --> 04:11:37.916
SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:11:37.982 --> 04:11:38.950
EXPERIENCING THEIR FIRST

04:11:39.017 --> 04:11:41.186
PSYCHOTIC EPISODE CANNOT REDUCE

04:11:41.252 --> 04:11:43.455
RELIANCE ON A VERY EXPENSIVE

04:11:43.521 --> 04:11:44.489
COMMUNITY BASED FULL SERVICE

04:11:44.556 --> 04:11:46.090
PARTNERSHIP. AND CAN FALL

04:11:46.157 --> 04:11:47.392
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS REDUCE

04:11:47.459 --> 04:11:49.661
RELIANCE ON EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE

04:11:49.727 --> 04:11:52.497
HOSPITAL BASED CARE. THERE'S A

04:11:52.564 --> 04:11:53.832
NUMBER OF STUDENT COBBLED

04:11:53.898 --> 04:11:56.100
CHAINS ARE LINKED SERVICES IN

04:11:56.167 --> 04:11:57.202
OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM

04:11:57.268 --> 04:11:58.269
WHERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

04:11:58.336 --> 04:12:00.872
TRACK INVESTMENTS. RECOGNIZE

04:12:00.939 --> 04:12:02.140
THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT

04:12:02.207 --> 04:12:03.508
WE'RE PROVIDING BE ABLE TO DO

04:12:03.575 --> 04:12:05.143
THE ANALYSIS TO DEMONSTRATE

04:12:05.210 --> 04:12:05.677
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE

04:12:05.743 --> 04:12:08.112
EFFECTIVE. AND THEN DO THE MATH

04:12:08.179 --> 04:12:09.914
AROUND THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE

04:12:09.981 --> 04:12:11.916
HAVING ON OUR BOTTOM LINE. ON

04:12:11.983 --> 04:12:13.151
THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE

04:12:13.218 --> 04:12:13.885
ACHIEVING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND

04:12:13.952 --> 04:12:16.087
COMMUNITIES. I WILL SHARE WITH

04:12:16.154 --> 04:12:18.256
YOU THAT OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES

04:12:18.323 --> 04:12:20.158
THAT ONLY ABOUT FORTY PERCENT.

04:12:20.225 --> 04:12:21.626
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR

04:12:21.693 --> 04:12:23.027
HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMMUNITY

04:12:23.094 --> 04:12:23.862

SERVICE PARTNERSHIP. ARE THERE

04:12:25.797 --> 04:12:27.165
WITH A PSYCHOSIS BAGNAIA

04:12:27.232 --> 04:12:29.400
DIAGNOSIS WHICH SUGGESTS WE MAY

04:12:29.467 --> 04:12:31.336
NOT BE USING THAT RESOURCE AS

04:12:31.402 --> 04:12:33.338
STRATEGICALLY. AS AS IS

04:12:33.404 --> 04:12:35.940
NECESSARY SO WE ARE COULD. TELL

HAVE ARTICULATED- IT IS VERY

04:12:42.113 --> 04:12:43.548
CHALLENGING. THERE'S LOTS OF

04:12:43.615 --> 04:12:45.350
STEPS TO GET THAT DONE I THINK

04:12:45.416 --> 04:12:46.384
WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT

04:12:46.451 --> 04:12:48.286
CAN'T BE DONE BUT WE NEED TO

04:12:48.353 --> 04:12:50.188
EXPAND THAT WORK DRAMATICALLY.

04:12:50.255 --> 04:12:51.990
SO THAT YOU AND THE PUBLIC HAVE

04:12:52.056 --> 04:12:53.224
THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO

04:12:53.291 --> 04:12:55.159
MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT

04:12:55.226 --> 04:12:57.595
INVESTING IN EXPANDED CARE. THE

04:12:57.662 --> 04:12:59.497
TYPE OF CARE WE INVEST IN AND

04:12:59.564 --> 04:13:07.272
OPPORTUNITIES IDEALLY OR HIGHLY.

04:13:07.338 --> 04:13:07.872
EFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND EARLY

AT THE TIME BECAUSE MANY

COUNTY INNOVATION PLANS THAT WE

04:21:31.142 --> 04:21:33.878
RECEIVED- THE LEVEL OF FINDING

04:21:33.944 --> 04:21:35.279
THE NAME OF THE PROJECT AND WE

TAKES FOR THE COMMISSION TO.

04:21:39.316 --> 04:21:40.851
REVIEW AND COUNTY INNOVATION

04:21:40.918 --> 04:21:43.421
PLAN THIS FISCAL YEAR THAT'S

04:21:43.487 --> 04:21:45.523
AVERAGING THIRTY SIX DAYS AND

04:21:45.589 --> 04:21:47.691
WE START THE CLOCK EITHER WAY

04:21:47.758 --> 04:21:48.492
AND THE COUNTY BOARD OF

04:21:48.559 --> 04:21:51.729

PRESENTATION ACCOUNTS ARE

04:21:59.770 --> 04:22:01.639
REQUIRED TO HAVE FOR EACH

04:22:01.705 --> 04:22:04.008
COUNTY INNOVATION BUT I AM. SO

04:22:04.075 --> 04:22:05.910
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROCESS

04:22:05.976 --> 04:22:07.445
IS DIFFERENT FOR INNOVATION

04:22:07.511 --> 04:22:10.247
THEN FOR P. E. I. OR C. AS THAT

04:22:10.314 --> 04:22:11.282
OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

04:22:11.348 --> 04:22:12.983
EXPENDITURES BECAUSE COUNTIES

04:22:13.050 --> 04:22:15.186
ARE NOT REQUIRED. TO GET STATE

04:22:15.252 --> 04:22:16.554
LEVEL APPROVAL AND SO THAT

04:22:16.620 --> 04:22:18.322
ADDITIONAL STAFF DOES FEEL LIKE

04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:20.424
A BURDEN. I'M I ALSO WANT TO

04:22:20.491 --> 04:22:21.425
POINT OUT THAT OVER THE LAST

04:22:21.492 --> 04:22:23.027
FEW YEARS WITH SUPPORT FROM THE

04:22:23.094 --> 04:22:24.995
LEGISLATURE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

04:22:25.062 --> 04:22:26.964
ABLE TO FACILITATE. MULTI

04:22:27.031 --> 04:22:30.134
COUNTY. INVESTMENTS IN SHARED

04:22:30.201 --> 04:22:33.070
INNOVATION SO WE HAVE EITHER

04:22:33.137 --> 04:22:35.172
PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR

04:22:35.239 --> 04:22:38.375
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON. SIX OR

04:22:38.442 --> 04:22:39.977
SEVEN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT

04:22:40.044 --> 04:22:41.946
COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT ABOUT

04:22:42.012 --> 04:22:44.715
FORTY COUNTIES. ON IT SEVERAL

04:22:44.782 --> 04:22:45.983
WAYS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:22:46.050 --> 04:22:49.753
INVOLVEMENT. STRENGTHENING FULL

04:22:49.820 --> 04:22:50.354
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. HANGING

04:22:50.421 --> 04:22:51.222
IN THE CRISIS MODEL I MENTION

04:22:51.288 --> 04:22:53.190
EARLIER- WE'RE CURRENTLY

04:22:53.257 --> 04:22:54.091
WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF

04:22:54.158 --> 04:22:55.559
COUNTIES TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

04:22:55.626 --> 04:22:57.928
EFFORTS USE INNOVATION FUNDS.

04:22:57.995 --> 04:22:59.263
TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND ETHNIC

04:22:59.330 --> 04:23:02.366
INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES. ARE

04:23:02.433 --> 04:23:04.468
EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK HAS BEEN

04:23:04.535 --> 04:23:06.170
LEVERAGING COUNTY INNOVATION

04:23:06.237 --> 04:23:07.872
FUND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW.

04:23:07.938 --> 04:23:10.207
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE

04:23:10.274 --> 04:23:12.610
HAVE APPROVED SIX HUNDRED AND

04:23:12.676 --> 04:23:13.210
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A

04:23:13.277 --> 04:23:15.546
COUNTY INNOVATIONS. AND NINETY

04:23:15.613 --> 04:23:18.315
SEVEN POINT 6% OF COUNTY PLANS

04:23:18.382 --> 04:23:20.017
ARE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION

04:23:20.084 --> 04:23:20.985
I THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT

04:23:21.051 --> 04:23:22.486
THAT PERHAPS THAT PERCENTAGE IS

04:23:22.553 --> 04:23:24.155
LITTLE TOO HIGH IT SUGGEST THAT

04:23:24.221 --> 04:23:26.724
MAYBE- THAT INNOVATION PLANS

04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:28.726
AREN'T AS EDGY AS THEY COULD BE

04:23:28.792 --> 04:23:30.861
IF WE WANT TO FUNDAMENTALLY.

04:23:30.928 --> 04:23:32.029
DISRUPT SOME OF THAT THE

04:23:32.096 --> 04:23:33.230
SERVICE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN

04:23:33.297 --> 04:23:34.532
PLACE TODAY THAT AREN'T WORKING

04:23:34.598 --> 04:23:36.467
AS EFFECTIVELY. AS THEY COULD

04:23:36.534 --> 04:23:39.236
BE- BUT WE DO NOT AGREE WITH

04:23:39.303 --> 04:23:41.205
THE CHARGE THAT ARE PUT OUR

04:23:41.272 --> 04:23:43.307
SYSTEM IS SLOW AND CUMBERSOME

04:23:43.374 --> 04:23:45.843
WE DO AGREE. THAT IT IS AN

04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:48.779
ADDED STAFF THAT COUNTIES OFTEN

04:23:48.846 --> 04:23:51.882
ARE HESITANT. TO FACE. WE HAVE

04:23:51.949 --> 04:23:54.151
DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

04:23:54.218 --> 04:23:57.521
ENSURE THAT OUR BEHAVIOR IT IS

04:23:57.588 --> 04:23:59.657
NOT WHAT CAUSES DEPARTMENTS AT

04:23:59.723 --> 04:24:01.125
COUNTIES TO LOSE MONEY TO

04:24:01.192 --> 04:24:02.426
REVERSION AND IN FACT WE HAVE

04:24:02.493 --> 04:24:04.428
ADDED ADDITIONAL MEETINGS.

04:24:04.495 --> 04:24:06.330
RIGHT UP TO THE JUNE DEADLINE

04:24:06.397 --> 04:24:08.666
SO THAT. WE CAN REVIEW THOSE

04:24:08.732 --> 04:24:10.467
PLANS TO AVOID REVERSION IF

04:24:10.534 --> 04:24:13.070
NECESSARY. IN TERMS OF THE

04:24:13.137 --> 04:24:14.305
QUESTION ABOUT THE STATUS OF

04:24:14.371 --> 04:24:16.373
UNSPENT FUNDS BY COUNTIES WE

04:24:16.440 --> 04:24:18.108
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ASK C. B.

04:24:18.175 --> 04:24:21.545
H. J. FOR CLARIFICATION AND THE

04:24:21.612 --> 04:24:22.880
DEPARTMENT THAT HAS THAT IF

04:24:22.947 --> 04:24:23.814
YOU'RE GOING FOR FIVE POINTS

04:24:23.881 --> 04:24:27.551
OUT- WE DO NOT YET HAVE THE-

04:24:27.618 --> 04:24:29.453
FISCAL REPORTING TO TELL US HOW

04:24:29.520 --> 04:24:31.055
MUCH MONEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

04:24:31.121 --> 04:24:33.824
REVERSION. IF THAT PROVISION IN

04:24:33.891 --> 04:24:36.293
THE LAW IS NOT WAIVE IT IS NOT

04:24:36.360 --> 04:24:38.829
POTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR- IT

04:24:38.896 --> 04:24:41.265
DOES SOUND LIKE IT THEN THE

04:24:41.332 --> 04:24:43.033
NUMBERS WOULD NOT BE VERY HIGH.

04:24:43.100 --> 04:24:44.201
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE

04:24:44.268 --> 04:24:50.908
ARE BECAUSE. THE REPORTING IT'S

04:24:50.975 --> 04:24:51.508
NOT YET AVAILABLE. ONE OF THE

04:24:51.575 --> 04:24:52.676
THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO OUT-

04:24:52.743 --> 04:24:53.644
THE COULD HAS IN THE- IF YOU

04:24:53.711 --> 04:24:56.180
RECOMMEND. THAT CURRENTLY FINDS

04:24:56.247 --> 04:24:57.881
THAT RIVER COME BACK TO THE

04:24:57.948 --> 04:24:59.683
STATE. AND ARE ULTIMATELY

04:24:59.750 --> 04:25:02.386
REDISTRIBUTED BACK TO COUNTY SO

04:25:02.453 --> 04:25:04.255
IN A- SORT OF YOU KNOW

04:25:04.321 --> 04:25:05.889
COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING

04:25:05.956 --> 04:25:08.192
METHOD. I'M INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES

04:25:08.259 --> 04:25:11.128
MAY LOSE SOME MONEY- BUT ACROSS

04:25:11.195 --> 04:25:13.030
ALL OF THE COUNTY'S IMAGES THEY

04:25:13.097 --> 04:25:14.632
DOLLARS THAT RIVER DON'T LEAVE

04:25:14.698 --> 04:25:16.600
THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE SYSTEM.

04:25:16.667 --> 04:25:18.335
THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS IN

04:25:18.402 --> 04:25:19.903
GETTING THOSE DOLLARS REVERTED

04:25:19.970 --> 04:25:21.305
BACK TO THE COUNTIES BUT THAT'S

04:25:21.372 --> 04:25:22.706
AN ISSUE WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE

04:25:22.773 --> 04:25:24.675
TO SPEED THAT UP. IN THE PAST

04:25:24.742 --> 04:25:26.443
THE COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED

04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:28.045
THAT IN THE INSTANCE WHERE

04:25:28.112 --> 04:25:29.980
COUNTIES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO

04:25:30.047 --> 04:25:32.049
USE THAT MUCH AS A REVENUES FOR

04:25:32.116 --> 04:25:33.317
THREE YEARS OR LONGER OR IN THE

04:25:33.384 --> 04:25:34.752
CASE OF SMALL COUNTIES FIVE

04:25:34.818 --> 04:25:36.453
YEARS OR LONGER. THERE'S SOME

04:25:36.520 --> 04:25:39.123
JUSTIFICATION THERE TO.

04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:40.791
REDIRECT THOSE DOLLARS TO

04:25:40.858 --> 04:25:43.060
PRIORITIES AND SO ONE THING

04:25:43.127 --> 04:25:44.628
THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS

04:25:44.695 --> 04:25:46.830
WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO.

04:25:46.897 --> 04:25:48.666
EXPLORE THEIR ABILITY O RETAIN

04:25:48.732 --> 04:25:50.968
THOSE DOLLARS. UNDER CONDITIONS

04:25:51.035 --> 04:25:53.003
THAT THEY DEDICATE THEM TO

04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:54.238
STATEWIDE PRIORITIES LIKE

04:25:54.305 --> 04:25:55.806
ADDRESSING INEQUITIES WHICH WE

04:25:55.873 --> 04:25:57.841
KNOW ARE- FUNDAMENTAL

04:25:57.908 --> 04:26:01.945
CHALLENGES. THAT WE MUST DO

04:26:02.012 --> 04:26:02.880
BETTER ON. CAPITA AGAINST ANY

04:26:02.946 --> 04:26:04.381
QUESTIONS THAT BE THAT I MEAN

04:26:04.448 --> 04:26:06.717
ADDRESS. IN MY FORMAL TESTIMONY

04:26:06.784 --> 04:26:09.320
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

04:26:09.386 --> 04:26:09.887
NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM S. K.

04:26:09.953 --> 04:26:13.624
ARDA. HERE IN AND I'M ACTUALLY

04:26:13.691 --> 04:26:14.992
GOING TO START WITH THE FIRST

04:26:15.059 --> 04:26:16.960
QUESTION BY JUST SAYING THAT I

04:26:17.027 --> 04:26:19.897
THINK- DR PIPER ANSWERED IT

04:26:19.963 --> 04:26:22.166
PERFECTLY. WE REALLY ARE NOT

04:26:22.232 --> 04:26:24.535
TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF FUN WE

04:26:24.601 --> 04:26:26.136
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FEW

04:26:26.203 --> 04:26:28.372
PLACES. WHERE CALVET NINETEEN

04:26:28.439 --> 04:26:31.041
HAS IMPACTED SOME EXPENDITURES

04:26:31.108 --> 04:26:33.310
SO SHE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

04:26:33.377 --> 04:26:34.845
COUNTIES ARE SPENDING MITCHELL

04:26:34.912 --> 04:26:37.414
SAY DOLLARS WE TYPICALLY DO WE

04:26:37.481 --> 04:26:39.283
SPEND 80% OF OUR IMAGE AS A

04:26:39.350 --> 04:26:41.151
DOLLARS IN TWO YEARS. WE HAVE

04:26:41.218 --> 04:26:42.720
WE HAVEFOR LARGE COUNTY THREE

04:26:42.786 --> 04:26:44.421
YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS

04:26:44.488 --> 04:26:45.856
FOR SMALL COUNTIES FIVE YEARS

04:26:45.923 --> 04:26:47.424
TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS AND WE

04:26:47.491 --> 04:26:48.992
DO DO THAT WITHIN THAT TIME

04:26:49.059 --> 04:26:51.328
FRAME. SO DOCTOR PAPERS

04:26:51.395 --> 04:26:53.397
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE ARE MOVING

04:26:53.464 --> 04:26:54.865
FORWARD AND THAT THE AMOUNT

04:26:54.932 --> 04:26:57.134
THAT UNSPENT IS IT'S A SMALL

04:26:57.201 --> 04:26:58.135
AMOUNT AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING

04:26:58.202 --> 04:27:00.604
ABOUT HERE. IS A SMALL AMOUNT

04:27:00.671 --> 04:27:03.173
OF DOLLARS WE ARE NOT ASKING

04:27:03.240 --> 04:27:05.008
FOR SAFEGUARDING REVERSION OF A

04:27:05.075 --> 04:27:06.710
LARGE AMOUNT BECAUSE THAT THAT

04:27:06.777 --> 04:27:08.312
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT WE

04:27:08.379 --> 04:27:09.880
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY

04:27:09.947 --> 04:27:12.649
ISOLATED PROJECT. REALLY JUST A

04:27:12.716 --> 04:27:14.885
HANDFUL OF PROJECTS. THAT HAVE

04:27:14.952 --> 04:27:17.087
COME TO US AND SAID BECAUSE THE

04:27:17.154 --> 04:27:19.123
POPE AT NINETEEN WE COULDN'T

04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:21.458
OPEN A WELLNESS CENTER SO WE

04:27:21.525 --> 04:27:23.193
COULDN'T EXPAND. THOSE DOLLARS

04:27:23.260 --> 04:27:24.828
BECAUSE OF HOPE IN NINETEEN

04:27:24.895 --> 04:27:27.998
WHERE WE PLANNED TO TRAIN FIVE

04:27:28.065 --> 04:27:29.767
THOUSAND PRIMARILY VETERANS. TO

04:27:29.833 --> 04:27:31.402
PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID

04:27:31.468 --> 04:27:32.369
WE WERE GOING TO START IN

04:27:32.436 --> 04:27:34.071
OCTOBER. BUT I'M SORRY WE'RE

04:27:34.138 --> 04:27:36.273
GONNA STARTING JANUARY TWENTY

04:27:36.340 --> 04:27:37.341
TWENTY WE COULDN'T WE HAD IT

04:27:37.408 --> 04:27:40.244
BACK. TO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY

04:27:40.310 --> 04:27:41.211
AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE

04:27:41.278 --> 04:27:42.479
CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THESE

04:27:42.546 --> 04:27:44.615
FUNDS WILL BE WILL BE SUBJECT

04:27:44.681 --> 04:27:46.517
TO REVERSION SO WE'RE LITERALLY

04:27:46.583 --> 04:27:47.584
TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF

04:27:47.651 --> 04:27:49.686
PROJECTS. LOOK LIKELY NOT MORE

04:27:49.753 --> 04:27:52.589
THAN TEN PROJECTS OUT OF THE

THAT THEY'RE BRINGING THE

04:28:21.251 --> 04:28:22.152
PROJECT AND WE GIVE THAT THE-

04:28:22.219 --> 04:28:22.920
ALWAYS SEE THE COMMISSION IS

INNOVATION POT. REALLY IT'S

04:28:34.631 --> 04:28:35.566

04:28:35.632 --> 04:28:37.301
COUNTIES THAT HAVEN'T HAD THE

04:28:37.367 --> 04:28:39.636

04:28:43.307 --> 04:28:45.342
INNOVATION PROJECT WHICH CAN

04:28:45.409 --> 04:28:48.212
TAKE SOME TIME. RIGHT NOW THE-

04:28:48.278 --> 04:28:50.547
THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZING THAT

04:28:50.614 --> 04:28:52.416
THERE ARE STILL AREAS FOR

04:28:52.483 --> 04:28:55.219
IMPROVEMENT. IN IN THIS PROCESS

04:28:55.285 --> 04:28:57.855
TRANSCONTINENTAL'S ARE FINANCE

04:28:57.921 --> 04:28:58.989
TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE

04:28:59.056 --> 04:29:00.858
ISSUES THE CD HOW THEY CAN

04:29:00.924 --> 04:29:02.192
IMPROVE THAT INNOVATION

04:29:02.259 --> 04:29:03.460
PROJECTS. WERE STRONGLY IN

04:29:03.527 --> 04:29:04.328

PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS.

04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:08.665

04:29:08.732 --> 04:29:10.767
OF THE ISSUES GET RESOLVED SOME

04:29:10.834 --> 04:29:11.635
OF THE ISSUES AND EXPERIENCES

04:29:11.702 --> 04:29:13.103
THAT WE HAVE. BECAUSE THE

04:29:13.170 --> 04:29:14.905
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IT'S EVEN

04:29:14.972 --> 04:29:19.510
FOR THOSE FOLKS. THAT ARE GOING

04:29:19.576 --> 04:29:20.010
TO BE HEARD IN JUNE. IF

04:29:20.077 --> 04:29:21.378
COMMISSION COMMIT OR THE CAN.

04:29:21.445 --> 04:29:23.413
DOES NOT APPROVE. THE PROJECT

04:29:23.480 --> 04:29:25.549
IF THEY DISAPPROVE THE PROJECT.

04:29:25.616 --> 04:29:26.550
AND THERE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE

04:29:26.617 --> 04:29:28.785
SUBJECT TO REVERSION IN THOSE

04:29:28.852 --> 04:29:30.854
PROJECTS. THEY WILL HAVE NO

04:29:30.921 --> 04:29:33.557
TIME. TO RETURN BACK AND

04:29:33.624 --> 04:29:34.791
SAFEGUARD THOSE FUNDS THOSE

04:29:34.858 --> 04:29:36.627
FUNDS WILL BE REVERTED EVEN

04:29:36.693 --> 04:29:37.995
THOUGH THEY DID ABSOLUTELY

04:29:38.061 --> 04:29:40.130
EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD TO DO.

04:29:40.197 --> 04:29:41.798
BUT IN THE END THE COMMISSION

04:29:41.865 --> 04:29:43.567
DID NOT APPROVE THEIR PROJECT.

04:29:43.634 --> 04:29:44.835

PROVIDER TO A SIMILAR PROVIDER.

04:33:13.276 --> 04:33:14.644
