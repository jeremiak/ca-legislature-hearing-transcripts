IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS MORNING'S HEARING. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF CALIFORNIA'S AMERICA'S CRISIS IS ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING. IN CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED FROM OPIOIDS. ACCORDING TO THE CDC. THIRTY PEOPLE DIE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM YOU AIDS EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS NOW MAKES. OVERDOSE A TOP FIVE CAUSE OF DEATH IN OUR COUNTRY. IT BREAKING AND AT EVERY STEP WE HAVE SEEN PREDATORS WHO ARE EXPLOITING. PEOPLE FOR PROFITS PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES DOCTORS WHO HAVE NO LEAD OVER PRESCRIBE THE DRUGS AND SCRUPULOUS REHABILITATION CENTER OPERATORS WHO ARE EXPLOITING MISSIONS FOR PROFITS. RIGHT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WELL THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK FOR THOSE SEEKING RECOVERY THERE ARE TOO MANY HORROR STORIES A PATIENT IS RECRUITED FROM STATE BY A BODY BROKER OUT OF NETWORK INSURANCE POLICIES ARE PURCHASED FOR THE PATIENT AND RUN OUT THOUSANDS. OF DOLLARS OR THIRTY SIXTY NINETY DAYS AND INSURANCE RUNS OUT THESE PATIENTS ARE CURBED EXACERBATING ARE HOMELESS CRISIS YES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED TO RELAPSE IN ORDER FOR THE CYCLE TO BEGIN AGAIN AND THIS IS A CYCLE THAT FAR TOO OFTEN. ENDS IN PATIENT DATA. CYCLE AS POSSIBLE TO A TOTAL LACK OF REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT IN THIS SPACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE STRATEGY STE TRAGEDIES HAVE WHEN ABSOLUTELY FLAT. AND IN THE MEANTIME PEOPLE ARE DYING EARLIER THIS YEAR I FORMED A AT BIPARTISAN WORKING GROUP ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT TO FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES. WE'RE GONNA STOP EXPLOITATION IN THE RECOVERY INDUSTRY ESTABLISHED STANDARD TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND PROVIDERS AND TO ENSURE THAT TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT EFFICIENT. AND EFFECTIVELY. WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO IN THIS SPACE TODAY'S HEARING WILL HELP US SHED LIGHT ON HOW UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS ARE I MEAN PATIENTS. NUMBER TWO WE'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT PRACTICES ON THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO HELP CLOSE REGULATION GAPS AROUND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AND THREE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW ENFORCEMENT WORKS IN ORDER TO SHUT DOWN BAD ACTORS IN THE FIELD AND IDENTIFY AREAS WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCALITY. HAD THEIR HANDS TIED WHERE WE AS STATE POLICYMAKERS NEED TO DO MORE I REALLY AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION I'D TO LEARNING TODAY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING REAL SOLUTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE FOR WE COLLECT OUR FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS ON THE DÍAS TO MAKE WELCOMING REMARKS. THE MORE I MEAN I AM A STATUS LIMÓN AARON QUIRK SILVA PRESENT NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WHICH INCLUDES CITIES OF FULLER AND WHAT A PARK WEST ANAHEIM CYPRESS STAND NUMBER COMMA- AND THIS ISSUE IS NOT ONLY AN ISSUE THAT I CARE ABOUT. BUT I'VE WORKED ON IN THE PAST I WAS ABLE TO MEET. AT WORK DIRECTLY WITH MAYOR A KATRINA FULLY IN AT THAT TIME FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATT. HARPER WHERE WE HOSTED A TOWN HALL AND HE ONLY HUNTINGTON BEACH REGARDING SOBRE BEING HOMES. I AND ALTHOUGH WE WERE MOVING LEGISLATION THAT NOT MOVE WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL WILL CONTINUE TO. WORK TOGETHER WITH THE LEAD OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND ACCOUNTABILITY CHAIR KADI PETERS NOT PRESS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DID COME OUT OF THAT TOWN HALL WAS TO ADDRESS. TO THE NEIGHBORS PARTICULARLY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THIS STEMS THAT PLATE ARE BROKEN BUT EVEN WITH A BROKEN SYSTEM THERE WERE SOME THINGS AT. WORK CLARIFIED THOSE BEING THAT TO MANY TIMES WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SOBRE AND HOMES- AS WOULD BE EXPECTED THE A PARTICIPANT CALL THE LOCAL. DEPARTMENT REALLY CLARIFYING THAT THE STATE DOES HAVE COMPLIANCE OFFICERS. THAT ARE THAT PART OF THE. WEEK PART OF OUR LOW FORMER LEGISLATION WAS TO TRY TO GET COM A COMPLIANCE OFFICER BASED HERE ACTUALLY OUT OF THE CITY OF COSTA MESA. AND MIKE WAS MENTIONED THAT DIDN'T MOVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT I DO KNOW AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD SPECIFICALLY THAT WHEN THE NEIGHBORS HEARD THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY. A LIVE VOICE TO SPEAK TO THEIR WORDS SOME OF RELIEF IN AT LEAST HAVING THE COMPLAINTS HURT AND DOCUMENTED AND THERE WERE SOME CHANGES IN OUR HOMES BEHAVIOR- BUT I WILL CLOSE WITH KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO BE VERY EAGER. TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS A COMMITTEE TO LEARN MORE BECAUSE AS WE NOTED IN THE CHAIRS OPENING REMARKS WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO DO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NOW LET ME ARE GIVE MY APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUDDY P. JEFF. DO AYE NORRIS TO. GET OUT TO GATHER A AND- B. OF GLEE MEMBER OF CORK CELL. HI IT'S CERTAINLY MY PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM ARE. THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS LAST YEAR THIS GOES BACK TWENTY YEARS I THINK NOW PROBABLY TWENTY TWO TO FOUR YEARS THAT. MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE ATTEMPT TO. BRING MORE OVERSIGHT AND LOCAL REGULATION AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS WE HAVE TO APPLAUD COSTA MESA- PRESENT AND PAST. THEY KINDA LED TO THE EFFORT AFTER NEW PER CHILD SUFFERED SOME. SERIOUS LITIGATION ALL. I IT WOULD SAY FINANCIAL IMPACTS WHICH KIND OF GOLD IN THE US SPIRIT IN THE OPPORTUNITY AND- COSTA MESA JUMPED IN A FIRE. IN OF DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD OF RECENTLY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UNDER. THE LEADERSHIP OF JOHN WAGNER. AN ANSWER WE'RE START TO FOCUS ON BEING ALSO AUTHORITY REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND ATTENTION AND AWARENESS WHAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE CAN REALLY START. JUMPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS INSTEAD OF AT THE STATE LEVEL I THINK KILEY SAID IT BEST WE'RE KINDA NIPPING AROUND THE EDGES BECAUSE WE'VE MADE PROGRESS A LOT OF PROGRESS AND THANK YOU TO HER OUT SHE SET UP A- SUBSTANCE ABUSE WORKING GROUP JUST THIS YEAR SO WE CAN. PUT TOGETHER A CALL LEFT SIDE OF THE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY THE PASSION TO. HELP OUR NEIGHBOR WE ALL LOOK AT THIS IS PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED ODD I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER ONCE UPON A TIME BEYOND WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES ADDICTED LIKE. VERY VERY SAD SPEAK FOR THEM AND CERTAINLY THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR FANS SO WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER TO HELP OF BOTH OF THE VICTIMS THEN CERTAINLY. NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE COMING VICTIMIZED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LOCAL CONTROL ON. THAT'S WILL BE MY TOTAL FOCUS AS WE GO FORWARD WE'VE GOT TO BRING THEM. I TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SINO SHARON SERVED ON ONE I'VE SERVED ON NOT ONE LOOK LOOK IN A GALLON BY THE WAY I HAD A SOBER LIVING HOME NEAR ME. AND THE ORIGINAL OPERATOR WAS NOT A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND WE HAD WHAT WAS MENTIONED SOMEONE KICKED OUT SITTING ON THE CURB A YOUNG LADY WHO ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OLD CRYING AT THE KEPT. CONFISCATED ALL OF HERBAL THINGS THAT JUST PUT HER OUT ON THIS PART BECAUSE HER INSURANCE RAN OUT AND THAT WAS AT MIDNIGHT. AS WELL DODD FOUND GOT FROM FOR. SO THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY OPEN WITH BAD OPERATORS NOW WE HAVE THAT SAME HOME OPERATING A GOOD OPERATOR AND I'VE NOTICED THAT. A LOT OF THE- ACTIVITIES GOING ON- KIND OF A WALK TOGETHER ARE CERTAINLY. IN THAT SO LIVING HOME THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF. GROUP OF HELPFUL ONLINE WITH YOUR- COUNSEL. THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO SEE BUT AND THEN IT'S NOT DISTURBING IN FACT I GOT KIND OF EXCITED THAT I'M SEEING DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING AND GOING. SO THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN IT AND PROBABLY BENEFIT. GETTING OFF THEIR STUFF HAVING OPPORTUNITY FOR A FULL LIFE AND THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE. SO WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER THANK YOU AGAIN QUALITY FOR ODD PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK BRINGING WHERE ELSE OUT THIS LOCAL LEVEL THEN ON UP TO STATE. THAT TWENTY TWENTY MIGHT BE THE YEAR WE COULD DIFFERENCE THAT I MENTIONED TO. A FEW HERE THAT THIS IS BEEN TWENTY YEARS IN THE MAKING AND I'M THE TWENTY TWENTY MIGHT BE A GOOD OMEN.

ON THIS FIRST PANEL WITH OUR TWO. TWO SPEAKERS. GOOD MORNING JOINING US MORNING. AND NANCY DO YOU WANNA GO AHEAD AND START US OFF. IT WILL BE INTRODUCTION OF ME I'D BE GREAT IN OFTEN SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. MY NAME IS NANCY CLARK BECAME INVOLVED IN THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR- I DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAM IN THE COURTS HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND- THE PURPOSE WAS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. BY GETTING HELP FOR PEOPLE WITH DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND THE LIKE- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD WAS FINDING RESOURCES FOR THESE PEOPLE SO IN NINETEEN NINETY WITH THE HELP OF SOMEONE I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. I OPEN THE RECOVERY CENTER AND SO WE HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS WE ARE A NINETEEN UNIT APARTMENT COMPLEX AND WE ARE STATE LICENSED FOR THIRTY EIGHT BALLOTS- WE TREAT MEN AND WOMEN- ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW AT THE PRESENT TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY WOMEN THERE- ALWAYS SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. AND. IT IS A LABOR OF LOVE- MY PHILOSOPHY IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MANY OTHER. TREATMENT PROVIDERS BECAUSE ALL OF MY RESIDENTS HAVE TO FOLLOW A DRESS CODE THEY PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY SERVICE OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM EMPLOYED. AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. SO I WANT TO PROUD OF WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. AND I'M HERE TO HELP IN ANYWAY I CAN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. YEAH SAM. GOOD DAY EVERYONE MY NAME IS LANDERS I AM A VERY ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY COUNTY. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO GO TO THE FORD CENTER MY SOBRIETY IT IS FEBRUARY SECOND NINETEEN NINETY FOUR GROUP STAY. YES TOMORROW I WILL HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SOBER AND CLEAN. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO- BUT SPONSOR WHO WAS ALSO THE DIRECTOR THE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF STONE'S ADOLESCENT RECOVERY HER NAME WAS PATTY A CHILL UP. SHE HAD THE MOST INTEGRITY WAS MOST ETHICAL PERSON I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE SHE AND I OPENED A SOBER LIVING. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN IN LAGUNA HILLS AT LAGUNA HILLS LAGUNA LANDING SOBER LIVING FOR WOMEN. ARE WE DID NOT ACCEPT INSURANCE WE HAD A PRICE POINT OF TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH I WAS ABLE TO STAY IN IT FOR A LITTLE UNDER THREE YEARS- I BASICALLY LOS MEASURE. AND THAT IS BECAUSE- WE WERE SO STRICT ON WHO WE LET IN. WE REQUIRED AT LEAST FIVE MEETINGS A WEEK WE REQUIRED YOU TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE BY EIGHT THIRTY IN THE MORNING. X. ARE AND SO FORTH THE- WE WERE ONE OF THE GOOD PLAYERS I WAS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN IT. I AM DELIGHTED THE SMOKING TO HEAR SENATOR BATES INVOKE THE GOOD PLAYERS AND REMIND TO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB. I DID PUT TOGETHER A FEW NOTES HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT BECAUSE THIS IS OVERWHELMING. BUT WHEN I EIGHT. I'M IN THE MEETINGS ALL THE TIME I LEFT MY NINE THIRTY WOMEN'S MEETING IN MISSION VIEJO TO BE HERE. AND I WAS IN A MEETING LAST NIGHT IN SAN CLEMENTE SIX PM AND YESTERDAY MORNING UP IN A MEETING SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO. AT TEN AM SO I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON I SEE PEOPLE RELAPSING AND- I KNOW THAT. THOSE OF US IN THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY. OF BITTER INVOLVED IN IF HOWEVER ARE INVOLVED IN TREATMENT CENTERS SO RELIVING WE USED TO SAY ABOUT THREE OUT OF FOUR OR THE BAD PLAYERS. NOW WE SAY ABOUT NINE OUT OF TEN. BECAUSE OF THE MONEY. AND IT IS ABOUT MONEY BECAUSE OF THE GREED. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO SAY YOUR TODAY IS. LET'S CORRECT BUT NOT OVER CORRECT. AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT THE COUPLE THINGS. SPECIFICALLY THAT I WANT TO MENTION ONE IS. I DON'T SEE ANY WAY AROUND THE FOLLOWING WHEN I HAD MY SOBER LIVING WE HAVE A TOTAL AMOUNT OF VISITATIONS FROM ANYONE POLICE OR ANYBODY ELSE ZERO. ZERO IN ABOUT LITTLE UNDER THREE YEARS. THE ONLY TIME WE WERE CHECKED OUT AS I WAS LIVING OF THAT SOBRE SOBER LIVING AT WORK WHICH IS A GREAT GROUP AND A GREAT ORGANIZATION THAT IS TRYING TO DO GOOD WORK. WE WERE NEVER THEY DID INSPECT THE- AND THEY WERE VERY THOROUGH AND GREAT JOB. WE NEVER HAD ANY CONTACT FROM THE POLICE WE NEVER HAD ANY OVERSIGHT. I KNOW THAT WE HAD CREATED A FAMILY THIS MOST PEOPLE WE EVER HAD AT ONE TIME WAS FOR. WE CREATED A FAMILY AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THE HALL THAT'S HOW PEOPLE STAY. SOBER CLEAN IS TO HAVE A FEELING OF BELONGING A FEELING OF COMMUNITY. WITHIN THE HOME. I DON'T SEE ANY WAY AROUND THE FOLLOWING. A LOT OF MONEY. IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE EXPLICATED TO PERFORM SPECIAL TEAMS. THAT ARE VERY WELL TRAINED VERY SPECIALIZED AND HOPEFULLY RECRUIT- INCLUDE AT LEAST SOMEONE FROM THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY BECAUSE. AS A FORMER ALCOHOLIC AND ADDICT I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT. SOME OF YOU KNOWN SOME OF YOU DON'T. WHEN WE'RE DRINKING IN USING. WE ARE THE SNAKE IS MOST MANIPULATIVE CLONING IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR UNANNOUNCED. THE BAD PLAYERS ARE GOING TO FIND A WAY AROUND IT YOU HAVE TO PUT SPECIAL TEAMS TOGETHER WELL TRAINED. RISE VISITS AT ALL TREATMENT SOBER LIVINGS ALL TREATMENT AND SOBER LIVINGS. AND PLEASE ON THOSE TEAMS AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO IS IN A RECOVERY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. THAT YOU GUYS STONE AND THAT YOU TO FRUSTRATE ME AND I FINALLY REALIZED. WITH PATIO CHOSE HELP HOW COULD YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE HEALTH OF ALCOHOLISM AND- ADDICTION IT'S SOME. IT'S INCREDIBLE BUT ONE THING THEY DIDN'T TELL ME AT THE BETTY FORD CENTER TOLD ME A LOT OF GREAT THINGS BUT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME IF YOU STAY CLIENTS OVER. YOU GONNA GO TO A LOT OF FUNERALS. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY FUNERALS I'VE BEEN TO. I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS WITH THIS. I SUGGEST ALL THE TIME FOR EVERYONE TO ATTEND MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A- AN ALCOHOLIC OR MEETINGS OF NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADDICT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE OPEN MEETINGS THAT CAN OPEN YOUR MINDS AND EXPOSE YOU YOU CAN HEAR THE SPEAKERS AND YOU CAN ALSO GO UP TO THE PEOPLE THAT RULE OUT OF THE VANCE FROM THE TREATMENT CENTERS YOU CAN WALK UP TO THEM YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF YOU CAN TALK TO THEM YOU CAN EXPERIENCE ONE ON ONE. AND I HAVE A SPECIFIC OUT THAT I'M HOPEFUL THAT EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM PARTICULAR PANEL WILL DOWNLOAD THE APP IS CALLED MEETING GUIDE. IS A WHITE CHAIR WITH THE BACKGROUND IT IS THE BEST OF. CAJUN THE MEETINGS IN THAT BEFORE. OPTION UNDER TIGHT AND YOU GOING THAT HAPPENED YOU PUT OPEN. PLEASE ATTEND AN OPEN MEETING PREFERABLY MORE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND YOU CAN TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN THE TREATMENT CENTERS AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND ONE FINAL COMMENT AND SPIRIT. OF A COOPERATION IN A CULTURAL CHANGE THAT THE GOOD PLAYERS IN THE. IN THIS IN THE INDUSTRY- FEEL THAT THERE'S A SORT OF A SPIRIT IT'S VERY ADVERSARIAL. AND A CULTURE OF THE US VERSUS THEM AND IF WE CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE THAT AND IF WE IF WE CAN BEGIN TO EMBRACE AN ALTAR OF. INCLUSIVITY INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVITY. AND WORK WITH THE GOOD PLAYERS YEAH I'M A NINE TO TEN I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT'S NINETEEN OUT OF TWENTY NOW IT'S SO. HORRIBLE AND THE RATE OF RELAPSE YOU CANNOT BELIEVE IT WHEN I GOT CLEAN AND SOBER NINETY FOUR PEOPLE DIDN'T TYPICALLY RELAPSE THANK GOD I'VE NEVER RELAPSE THAT'S WHY I GO TO A LOT OF MEETING. I HOPE EVERYONE WILL ATTEND OPEN MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS DOWNLOAD THAT APP AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE EFFORTS IT'S GOING TO TRYING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IT'S NOT EASY THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE AND YOU GUYS ARE MOVING FORWARD AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. TODAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO YOU. YOU MENTIONED THAT AT ONE POINT IT FELT LIKE IT WAS. THREE FOUR THE PLAYERS IN THIS SPACE WERE BAPTIZED AND NOW IT'S LIKE NINE TO TEN MAYBE NINETEEN OUT OF TWENTY. FROM BOTH OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DRIVING. THAT SHIFT IN DRIVING SO MANY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS AND SO MANY YOU KNOW PREDATORY PLAYERS. TO GET IN THIS SPACE NET PROFIT. IT'S THE MONEY OKAY MY THOUGHT IS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN EVERY WHO GO INTO THIS FIELD AND ACTUALLY TO HELP PEOPLE BUT- THEY USED TO BE ADDICTED TO DRUGS ALCOHOL THEY BECOME ADDICTED TO MONEY. AND THEY CUT CORNERS AND THEY DO WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO BUT ANOTHER ANOTHER PLAYER IN ALL OF THIS IS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO CORRECT THE WAY THAT THEY DO BUSINESS BECAUSE INHERENT IN INSURANCE BILLING. IS ONE FALSEHOOD AFTER ANOTHER AND IT BECOMES THIS GAME OF A RECOVERY CENTER TRYING TO CONVINCE THE INSURANCE COME THAT THERE'S MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR TREATMENT. THEY THEY GO BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PING PONG BALL. IT SHOULD NOT BE OUT. ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO NOT PAY OUT ANY MONEY. AND THEN THE RECOVERY CENTERS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET THE LAST NICKEL. WHETHER THAT IS HONEST TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED OR NOT- OVERSIGHT IS DEFINITELY THE ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND PATTY WAS ONE OF MY- BIG HEROES- SURPRISED IT'S- ABSOLUTELY NO IF YOU'RE RUNNING YOUR FACILITY CORRECTLY YOU SHOULD NEVER BE WORRIED. OVERSIGHT OR NOT. FOR PEOPLE DROPPING BY- FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD A SOBER LIVING IN COSTA MESA WE HOUSE SEVENTY TWO PEOPLE AND I BET NONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM KNEW THAT. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES. IT WAS A GOOD FACILITY IT DID HAPPEN TO BE SURE OF CERTIFIED WHICH MEANT THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CAME BY ON A REGULAR BASIS AND COSTA MESA CODE ENFORCEMENT CAME BY ON A REGULAR BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE OPERATING. A PRO LIFE. OVERSIGHT IS THE ONLY ACTOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE AIR SIR CERTIFIED IS THAT NOT SOMETHING THAT. ANY A SOBER LIVING HOME COULD IT TAINT THROUGH A CERTAIN PROCESS. DON'T THEY NO LONGER HAVE THAT NOW WE CONTRACT WITH THE SHASTA MEANT TO PROVIDE SERVICES YOU RELEASED FROM JAIL. THAT'S WHAT NECESSITATED THE CERTIFICATION. IT WAS REALLY EASY IT WASN'T DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN- BUT GAVE US LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THEN ALSO- FOR SANDY SELL SELL YEAH SORRY YOUR UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YOU KNOW I THINK ANY OF US WHO. OTHER YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER IN MY CASE I HAVE. A BROTHER WHO. IT WHO HAS NOT ONLY DEALT WITH ALCOHOLIC ADDICTION BUT ALSO DIED THIS PAST YEAR. BUT I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WOULD BE I ALSO HAD ANOTHER SISTER THOUGH- HAD ISSUES BUT WAS ABLE TO IN MANY WAYS. BE ABLE TO RECOVER AND SHE HAS TALKED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IT'S BEEN PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS. YOU MENTIONED YOUR BIRTHDAY I KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU'VE TALKED TO SOMEBODY WHO'S WHO RECOVERED. THEY OFTEN TELL YOU ALMOST TO THE MINUTE YOU KNOW SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH THAT. AND SHE ALSO WAS GONNA MANY MEETINGS BUT WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY WHO MAY GO INTO RECOVERY OR HAVE SUPPORT IN BOTH CASES THEY DID. AND I KNOW SOME WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT IN ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT SOMEBODY WHO JUST. TAKES ONE PATH AND THE OTHER DOESN'T IT I MEAN IF THERE'S THEIR FATE CAN YOU CANNOT. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST RELEVANT SELLING QUESTIONS THE ANSWERS THAT IS SUCH A COMPLEX. DIFFICULT THING TO UNDERSTAND. YOU ON THE MAIN KEY YET I SPONSOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT WOMEN PAT MONSTER. I'M SO HAPPY YOU. DO YOU KNOW HOW INCREDIBLE SHE WAS. GO TO ELAINE WE DO TO GET DRUGS AND A DRINK INTO USE WE'RE WILLING TO DO IT YOU HAVE TO APPLY THIS MENTALITY OF NEW SPONSOR YESTERDAY ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT WILLING TO GO TO ANY LENGTHS. I INVOKE. GOT IN THIS IF YOU INVOKE A HIGHER POWER IT'S IN THE STEPS I YOU KNOW IT. IS A PERSON WILLING TO USE THE STEPS AND WILLING TO VOCAL INVOKE A HIGHER POWER ALSO IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GO TO A REPUTABLE. TREATMENT SOBER LIVING OR PLACE LIKE I WAS BETTY FORD CENTER YOUR FOUNDATION IS OUTSTANDING I HAD A FOR WONDERFUL FOUNDATION FROM DAY ONE. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL QUESTIONS IT IS BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING IN SO MANY KIDS GOING IN AND OUT. OF I WILL SAY THIS AND I BROUGHT A PAMPHLET FOR YOU A FROM COLLEGE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE- ALMOST ALL OF US HAVE A CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER I DO. I'M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT I USED TO BE. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO AND THAT GETS VERY COMPLICATED BECAUSE THAT CALLS FOR OUTSIDE HELP AND IT'S A VERY STICKY THING BUT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. SOME DON'T- BUT- WILLINGNESS TO GO TO ANY LENGTHS SOME PEOPLE TO BE ON THE GRASP OF. IT'S AMAZING TO SIT MEANINGS IN TWO PEOPLE SHARE AND TALKING TO PEOPLE GO IN AND OUT AND TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. YOU HAVE TO PUT IT FIRST BEFORE EVERYTHING INCLUDING YOUR CHILDREN YOUR HUSBAND YOUR WIFE YOUR JOB EVERYTHING. WHAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT- RECOVERY IS CONTAGIOUS AND YOU CATCH IT MEETINGS. AND YOU NEED TO BE IN GOOD ME AND YOU NEED TO BE AND SAFE BEATING JUST LIKE YOU NEED TO BE IN IN A SAFE RECOVERY ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE. WHO'S READY AND WHO'S NOT EXCEPT BY WHAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE- I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES JOBS HOMES EVERYTHING AND THEY STILL ARE READY- IT'S A VERY ELUSIVE. ELUSIVE THING WHAT YOU NEED TO KEEP TRYING YOU IT'S KIND OF LIKE DIETING- BUT THERE ISN'T A PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO WENT ON A DIET ONLY ONE TIME IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND THEN WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK SAID WELL I'M JUST GONNA BE FAT FOREVER- YOU HAVE TO STAND UP BRUSH YOURSELF OFF AND HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. RING DIFFERENT TOOLS WITH YOU. WHAT I HAVE SEEN CHANGE IN THE RECOVERY BUSINESS THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN IT. IS A LOT MORE COAL CO OCCURRING DISORDERS- WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO RECOVERY. WHO HAVE BEEN USED TO SAY. CO CO OCCURRING DISORDERS ARE YOU HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE- WERE SUBJECTED TO ABUSE MOLESTATION ALL. DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY YOU. WHEN I STARTED WORKING RECOVERY IN THE SEVENTIES BASICALLY ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS SOBRE SOMEBODY UP. AND THEY WENT ON AND DID PRETTY WELL- BY THE EIGHTIES THE END OF THE EIGHTIES IN PARTICULAR. DRUG ADDICTS WERE NOT HAVING DRUG ADDICTED CHILDREN. SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE COMING FROM THESE INTACT FAMILIES YOU NOW HAVE PEOPLE BRING ALONG A LOT OF BAGGAGE AND WITHOUT GETTING SIMULTANEOUS THERAPY ALONG WITH RECOVERY. THEY THEY WERE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO STAY SOBER. THEN ENTERS THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THEM BECAUSE MOST DOCTORS KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT COVERING AN ADDICTION AND IF THEY'RE TRAINED TO TREAT THE SYMPTOMS THEY'RE TRAINED TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS THEY'RE TRAINED TO MAKE GOAL WAY WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT A MOMENT. SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T GIVE SAN NEXT TO AN ALCOHOLIC WHO COMPLAINS THAT THEY HAVE ANXIETY- IT'S FINE BUT WHEN TO BE. AND SO THERE ARE SO MANY FACETS TO THIS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DOCTORS THE CITY. AND EVEN THE RECOVERY INDUSTRY- RIGHT NOW IF I HAD A POINT WALK INTO MY OFFICE WHO NEEDED TO BE DETOX. I'D BE HARD PRESSED WHERE TO SEND THE WE HAD SOMEBODY THAT. THAT SO DURING MY OFFICE WAS TRYING TO FIND A DETOX AND FOR THE OTHER DAY AND- RANDY BEDS. SO FOR THE PERSON WANTS TO GET SOBER WHERE DO THEY GO WITH THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THANK YOU I'M JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT. ALL OF US AT THE STATE LEVEL ARE GRAPPLING. DALY BECAUSE NOT JUST THAN TALKING OUT AN ADDICTION OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL MULTIPLE ISSUES AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO ADDING TO THAT HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE FOR MANY OF THEM THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. SO WE HAVE HAD VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE AND THAT COULD BE A TEMPORARY SHELTER- ORANGE COUNTY OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A FULL DAY'S WORTH OF A COMMENTARY ON HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT BUT THEN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THEN WHEN YOU ADD IN THE DIRECTION WITH POSSIBLY A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IT COMPLICATES IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE- SOMEBODY WILL EVEN IF TWO OF THOSE ISSUES WOULDN'T NECESSARILY DO WELL ON EMERGENCY SHELTER. AND CERTAINLY INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IF WE HAD THEM WHICH WE HAVE A HUGE LACK OF BAD WOULDN'T NECESSARILY DO WELL THERE SO WE HAVE LOCKED UP WHAT ARE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES. TO THOSE TWO SCENARIOS AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. IS THERE A THIRD FOR THREE FIFTH TYPE OF LOSING SO THAT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT AT AND. WITHOUT YES. SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT MY BROTHER BUT I GUESS IT'S IN A YEAR ONE YEAR TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE PASSED AWAY IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE JUST THE FACTS THAT INDIVIDUAL IS YOU KNOW IT AFFECTS THEIR FAMILY MY MOTHER. IS EIGHTY FOUR AND HAS SUFFERED INCREDIBLY SENSES PASSING- AS WELL AS- ALL OF US SO. I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION THEY CAN HAVE THE EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY TO NOT JUST DISCARD PEOPLE. AND NOT TO JUST GIVE UP BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART WHERE. I MEAN I CAN'T TELL YOU IN MY WORK HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAVE HEARD WHAT JUST PUT HIM ON A BUS AND SEND THEM OUT TO THE DESERT. OR LET'S JUST SEND THEM THE SAN BERNARDINO OR IN A ORANGE COUNTY IS A GREAT PLACE BUT THINGS ARE SO EXPENSIVE AND WE REALLY WHY WOULDN'T WE SEND THEM TO A AREA WHERE. THE COST OF LIVING IS CHEAPER AND THEN IT ALL MAKES SENSE AND THESE ARE NOT SOLUTIONS THEIR SIMPLISTIC. IN A VERY COMPLEX WORK. AND IT WAS ELECTED LEADERS IT'S OUR JOB TO NOT MOVE INTO A PATHWAYS THAT TAKE US DOWN A ROAD OF. A LEAN TOWARDS A SOLUTION THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A SOLUTION IF YOU ASK CENTER BERNIE DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD THINK THAT WAS GREAT IF U. S. DESERT CITIES BUT THERE COULD BE SOLUTION IN. AN INCREDIBLE. MARK BECAUSE WITH SOME FIRST PLEASE WOULD BE THE IDEA THAT THERE COULD BE A HOST THE. LET'S BILL THIS TIME WHETHER IT BE A MENTAL HEALTH SLASH ADDICTION CENTER. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HOST IT COULD PROVIDE JOBS BUT THAT HAS TO BE A MUTUAL AGREEMENT VERSUS WAS JUST PACK EVERYBODY UP AND GET HIM OUT OF HERE. SO THANK YOU I THINK THAT- SORT OF BUILDING ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLUBS ALL THOSE FACING. I THINK THAT THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT THE INNER SEVEN TREATMENT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SYSTEM OF CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT FROM DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE FIFTY YEARS AGO. THAT'S THE BAD NEWS I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT RIGHT HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY WE ARE MAKING. SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE STE. AT THE WELL I'M MENTAL HEALTH AND WHAT HAD THERE IS THE GROUND BREAKING THAT FACILITY IN ORANGE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO MANY OF US MANY OF US WERE. THAT AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A CUTTING EDGE. YOU'RE KIND OF BEST IN CLASS FACILITY RIGHT HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THERE IS A VISION THAT WE WANT. AS A THREE TABS THE BILL SIR THE NEEDS. OF ALL ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO. FOR A HOT HANDS TO USE. MY CELL THERE DEFINITELY SEND SOME POSITIVE THINGS ON THE HORIZON. THERE IS ON THERE SO MUCH MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. SENATOR MAKES QUESTION FIVE. I USED TO BILL AND THIS GOES TO SEE. OF THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE OF ASKING WHO ARE GOING TO OPERATORS OF THE R. T. APPS. AND THE BILL OF FELL ON HARD TIMES BECAUSE FELT IT WOULD BE THE MINOTAUR A TO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK AND DISCOVER THAT ZOMBIE LIKE YOURSELVES SAL HAD THE PROBLEM BUT WAS RECOVERED. HANDED THAT WOULD SHOW UP IN A BACKGROUND CHECK AND I SAID- BETTER THEY ON ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS RECOVERED TO RUN ONE OF THOSE WOULD YOU FEEL FROM SORT OF A FILM FOR OFFENDED IF YOU WENT IN REPLY IN YOU THERE IS A BACKGROUND CHECK AND CHILLED OUT BECAUSE MY BILL ALSO PROVIDED. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. TO PUNCH YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT YOU HAD ON THE TWELVE STEPS THAT YOU WERE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THAT. MEAN TO ME YOU BE LAYING OUT YOUR RECOVERY. HALF IN THAT WOULD BE VERY CONVINCING I AM NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE SOME THE. THE POWERS THAT BE THAT THAT WAS THE PROVISION BILL THAT WOULD HELP THE RESULT I INTRODUCED THE BILL IS BECAUSE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEWS GROUP IN THERE IT WILL ON A YEAR LONG INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS. CREATING BAD ACTORS IN IN THIS BUSINESS SO WHY NOT GO TO THE HEART OF THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED WHAT YOU DID TO BE RUNNING THESE RECOVERY CENTERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THE PASSED THE HOUSE AND THAT KIND OF A LONG QUESTION WITH THE STATEMENT BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR- THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE- WE CAN. RESTART SOME OF THE OF. WE HAVE. THE THANK YOU OF OUR IN OUR LET'S THEIR PRESENTATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE WILL HELP OUR GET PEOPLE THINKING DIFFERENTLY IN GET THINGS PASSED BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE GET STOPPED AND THINGS THAT ARE YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE AT THAT MOMENT FROM AB IN FACT THIS IS A GOOD THING. IT'S NOT FROM DETERRENT. IN NOTHING BERRA THING A DISCRIMINATORY. I WAS SHOCKED THAT I WASN'T CHECKED OUT I WAS SHOCKED THAT I WASN'T SCRUTINIZED I WAS AND NOBODY. LOOKED CARE. I ALSO SHOT FROM A ROOFTOP THE I AM PROUD THAT I'M CLEAN AND SOBER AND- PATIO CHIRLA. TO BE I WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT HER AND BALD MEN SHE'S EXPERT ON THIS AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE WAS TO CREATE A KEEP A FAMILY WITHIN THE HOME. WHAT YOUR BILL WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME IS SOLUTION AND EFFECTIVE. EVERYBODY GOING INTO THIS WHO'S GONNA RUN SHOULD BE CHECKED OUT THOROUGHLY BACK EVERY KIND OF BACKGROUND CHECK. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYTHING IN MY BACKGROUND THAT WOULD COME UP THAT SHOWS I'M IN RECOVERY OTHER THAN MY SHOWING UP THINGS LIKE THIS AND SAYING IT. WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE ELEVEN TRADITION THOSE OF YOU IN RECOVERY NOW IT IT'S A VIOLATION TO SAY YOU'RE A MEMBER OF. A PARTICULAR GROUP PATTY AND I WENT TO A OF A BIG SYMPOSIUM ON A IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO SAY YOU'RE- A WOMAN IN LONG TERM RECOVERY. WHAT I GOT OUT OF THE BETTY FORD CENTER I CALLED THE VERY DAY I GOT OUT TO ASK HOW I WAS DOING AN INTERVIEW FOR A MAGAZINE- BECAUSE I WAS A MUSICIAN AT THE TIME AND- I ASKED SOUNDS BETTY FORD HANDLE. SHE SAYS I REFER TO AS I SEEK A SOLUTION- AND SUPPORT IN TWELVE STEP GROUPS. SO LETTING PEOPLE KNOW YOU'RE IN RECOVERY IS A GREAT THING WHAT YOU TRY TO IMPLEMENT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY WHO. CARERS AND WHO WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING WOULD BE ADVERSE TO THAT THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU'D BE ADVERSE THAT AS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE. THE ONLY REASON. I WOULD THINK THAT IF I'M IF I'M A RECOVERING ADDICT. AND I DO I DOUBT- YOU KNOW THE HIGHER POWERS DIRECTING ME TO HELP MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE IN THE SAME BOAT. I WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A- LIFE AND CITY AND- **** SURE I STORY IF I COULD BE VERY CONVEYANCE I'M THINKING LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ON THIS PANEL. BOB SO SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO GET OUT. OF STE WITH PEOPLE COMING TO OUR COMMITTEES INTENSIFYING WHO ARE. YOU KNOW REFORM TO RECOVERED ADDICTS. THE OTHER THING I TRIED TO DO WAS. OUT FIND FUNDING FOR A- A FACILITY IN SACRAMENTO. ARE THEY OUT TO IS SEEN CHARMS PROGRAM WHICH I ACTUALLY HELPS WOMEN WHO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN MOVE BECAUSE THEY- HAD SUBSTANCE ABUSE SOLVE. ITS OF LIKE A CAMPUS AN INDIAN TEACHES THEM AND TING ON HOW TO GET THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE YOU NAME IT. THREE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN CAMPED AT HAND BLOSSER CHILDREN AT DICTION AND ALSO. BEING INVOLVED IN THE ON THE- THAT. CAME TO TELL US WHY DID THE PRE SHEET IT BEING DRUG. WHICH WAS A REQUIREMENT ARE WE DO NOT SUPPORT. GIVE MANY TOUR ANY SORT OF PROGRAMS THERE'S DRUG TESTING BECAUSE IT'S HOUSING FIRST BUT IF YOU CAN LIKE ME HAVING TO WATCH YOU FOR THE LAST- MANY MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN FIVE A WHEN I GO INTO A WAIT OUR CONTROL PROGRAM I LOVE TO BE WEIGHED BECAUSE ON FRIDAY WHEN I'M GOING AND I MAKE SURE I'M NOT EATING WHAT I SHOULDN'T. SO TO ME IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED THAT LITTLE EXTRA MOTIVATION SO IF I'M AN ADDICT AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE DRUG BUT AND I'M GETTING MY CHILDREN BACK THERE I BEEN SEPARATED FOR THERE WERE THREE YOUNG WOMEN ARE BARELY OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN BLOCK GRANTS CRYING OUT THIS COMMITTEE MEETING AND THEY STILL DIDN'T PASS THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS. TO BE OUR COMPLETED A COMPETITIVE I'LL GRANT PROGRAM WHERE THEY WOULD BE GIVEN MONEY TO EXPAND IT TAKE MORE ARE MORE INDIVIDUALS I THOUGHT YOU GUYS- THAT WE ALL NEED TO AS HUMAN BEINGS THE MOTIVATION NOT TO EAT THAT DON'T. NOT TO TAKE OUT NEXT WHATEVER RADIOS BECAUSE THERE SOME HIGHER THAN JUST THE SATISFYING. URGE TIME WORKING TOWARDS. HE CAME TO BAT YOU GOT IN THE RECOVERY CENTER AND USE OUR WILL REALLY REALLY HELP US AS WE REINTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT SOME OF THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND JUST GETTING DRUG TESTED. IS SOMETHING HEY PLEASE DRUG TEST ME PLEASE TELL US THAT I TOO COULD DONATE YESTERDAY AND SHOULD NOW. NOW I GAINED HALF A POUND. IT IT HELPS US. THE HUMAN NATURE I SPEAK TO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS YEAH THE ISSUE. OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PROBATION DEPARTMENT HAD AND. APPROVED LIST OF FACILITY. AND IT. CRIER AND OF THAT WAS THAT EVERYONE STAFF HAD TO HAVE A BACKGROUND. THEY ALSO REQUIRED A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS OF SOBRIETY THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY BACKGROUND CHECK ON YEARS OF SOBRIETY. BUT IT. IT WOULD BE REALLY ALL THAT A PERSON HAD STOPPED GETTING ARRESTED IN GETTING IN TROUBLE THE PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THAT THEY HAD THEY HAD GOTTEN SOBER THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT DISBANDED THAT UNIT BECAUSE OF FUNDING. BUT WHEN THAT UNIT WAS OPERATIONAL THE COURTS. WOULD NOT SEND ANYONE TO A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT ON THEIR APPROVED LIST THEREFORE. YOU KNOW KNOWING ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE HAD PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK THE ONE DRAWBACK ON A BACKGROUND CHECK IS IT ONLY TELLS YOU AN ARREST RECORD. AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM MAKING A VALUE JUDGMENT WITH IS THEIR ARREST RECORDS SO HORRIBLE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS WHEN IN MANY CASES THAT COULD BE THE VERY. IMPETUS FOR SOMEONE TO GET SOBER AND THAT WOULD BE A VERY VALUABLE THING FOR THEM TO HAVE BUT IT CERTAINLY WOULD TELL YOU THAT THE PERSON. ISN'T CURRENTLY ON PROBATION OR PAROLE AND OPERATING A FACILITY BECAUSE NO ONE ON PROBATION OR PAROLE SHOULD OPERATE. A SOBER LIVING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. BE EMPLOYED THERE IN MY OPINION. ONE THING ORDER COMPLICATED TO LOOK MORE HIDEOUS THIS IS OF. PEOPLE WHO. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME PEOPLE THAT REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS. WHO RUN IT SERVER LIVINGS TREATMENT CENTERS WHO ARE GOOD PLAYERS THOSE OF US WHO WERE CLEAN AND SOBER. IT IS HAPPENED A RELAPSE CAM TO THEM TOO. AND OF THERE HAS TO BE SOME OVERSIGHT SOME WE. I KNOW I KNOW PERSONALLY KNOW PEOPLE WITH FORTY THREE YEARS SOBRE THAT HAVE RELAPSED OF THERE ARE I PERSONALLY KNOW OF GOOD PLAYERS IN THE IN THIS COMMUNITY IN THIS TOWN IN SAN CLEMENTE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO I ALSO KNOW OWNERS THAT HAVE RELAPSE THEMSELVES AND ARE. AS WE SAY OUT THERE THEN THAT'S NOT LIKE A MENTAL THAT'S MEANING OUT THERE USING AND DRINKING- IT'S A REALLY COMPLEX THING BUT I REALLY THINK THAT ONE OF THE CORE THINGS IS THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THE GOOD PLAYERS- NEED TO BE NOT ONLY CHECKED INITIAL. BUT ONGOING. NOT JUST IN THE BEGINNING. AND THERE HAS TO BE TEAMS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED. EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION I CAN'T FIGURE OUT ANYWHERE AROUND THAT. WELL THANK YOU BOTH AGAIN DREAM PART IS I THINK AS AS PAT PAT SAID AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU KNOW POLICY SOLUTIONS AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION I THINK THAT THIS PARTNERSHIP IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL SO ME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING. THANK YOU AS WELL I HAVE A LOVELY PARTING GIFT. MOVING ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS. ON WHAT IS REAL TREATMENT WILL BE HEARING FROM A HANDFUL OF THREE EXPERTS. FOR DIED IN FOR LOS WHO'S THE VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL FROM HIS HOLDEN BETTY FORD FOUNDATION. AND DOCTOR RANDOLPH HOMES HOMES THE CARE OF THE PUBLIC POLICY CAN. FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY ADDICTION MEDICINE. WELCOME TO BOTH YOU AT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. RIGHT JENNIFER WILL GO AHEAD AND START WILL GO WITH YOU. WELL GOOD MORNING IN- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS AS WELL- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. POLITY ADDICTION TREATMENT- AS THE CHAIRWOMAN. A SEATED I AM THE HE'S AND BETTY FORD FOUNDATION OUR ORGANIZATION FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH US- IS THE LARGEST NONPROFIT PROVIDER OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT IN THE COUNTRY. WE STARTED IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE AND TODAY WE'VE EXPANDED- INTO SEVENTEEN SITES IN NINE DIFFERENT STATES INCLUDING THE BETTY FORD CENTER RANCHO MIRAGE INTO OTHER OUTPATIENT CENTERS HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. UP AND THROW THE COUNTRY WE TREAT MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS- BOTH AT OUR CLINICS AND THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES. ARE NONPROFIT ALSO INCLUDES AN ACCREDITED GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADDICTION STUDIES A PUBLISHING HOUSE RESEARCH CENTER- AND EDUCATION ARM OF FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN A PROGRAM FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION AND THEIR FAMILY. IN CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY HIS THAN BETTY FORD HAS A BILL THAT SELF TO EVERY OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY ACCREDITATION AND LICENSING- THAT IS PERTINENT TO OUR WORK OUR HIRING STANDARDS FOR COUNSELORS. REQUIRE AT LEAST A MINIMUM OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND- YOU KNOW STRONG PREFERENCE TOWARDS A MASTER LEVEL CLINICIANS. THE BETTY FORD CENTER OUR LARGEST CENTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA- MAINTAINS LICENSE AND CERTIFICATION ONLINE TO FULL TREATING CONTINUUM. WITH LONG SUPPORTED QUALITY BASED STANDARD. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON AND CRACKING DOWN ON UNETHICAL PRACTICES. BUT REALLY MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE- ALTHOUGH I FEEL DOES REALLY GREAT WORK I TO ENSURE OPTICAL QUALITY CARE FOR THOSE WHO SEEK ADDICTION BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARDS AND A MANDATORY CONSISTENT ENFORCEABLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT CALIFORNIA. IT'S WITH THIS BACKGROUND THAT I'M HERE TO IT TO TALK ABOUT THREE WAY IS THAT K. MISSION IMPROVE REGULATION I THE DICTION SHIPMENT INDUSTRY. THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE OLD OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES AND INDIVIDUAL LICENSING STANDARDS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AS A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF CARE THAT SPANS MANY STATES. ALSO I WANNA START SOME HUMILITY WE LIKE ALL PROVIDERS. I BY NO MEANS PERFECT. WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF CHANGES TO OUR AGING BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE AUDITING A MYRIAD OF STANDARD- THROUGHOUT OUR NATIONAL SYSTEM OF CARE- AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THE BEST AND HIGHEST QUALITY SERVICES THAT WE CAN. BUT WE FEES CHALLENGES AND WE STRIVE TO GET BETTER EVERY DAY. WE OFTEN PARTNER WITH OUR STATE LICENSING ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THAT. IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STEP TO REFORM MUST BE TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE PROGRAM STANDARDS THAT ARE MANDATORY AND QUALITY FOCUSED IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING A VOLUNTARY. NATURE OF STATE CERTIFICATION AND OF ITSELF IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC. FROM QUALITY CARE TO BILLING AND NUMEROUS OTHER FORMS OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. IN NO OTHER OF OUR HOME ST STE- OUTPATIENT TREATMENT LICENSE HERE OPTIONAL. INSTEAD STATES MAINTAIN LICENSING BASED UPON SPECIFIC QUALITY BASS LINES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ORDER AND IN MINNESOTA OUR STATE LICENSE AGENCIES HAVE CODIFIED STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE. WITHIN BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTING SO FOR EXAMPLE AN UP WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL LICENSE OR A RESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF CARE DOESN'T ADAM- AUTOMATICALLY EQUATE TO A DETOX LICENSE THAT'S A SEPARATE LEVEL OF LICENSING. I'M AND- A VERY ATION TO RESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF KERR. SO THIS AND POOR- HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY. THE VOLUME OR NUMBER OF HOURS OF SERVICES ALONE IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE INDICATOR OF QUALITY TREATMENT. WHAT HAPPENS DURING THOSE HOURS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW MANY HOURS ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED. IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS MINNESOTA LEGAL SANDERS RECENTLY MODIFIED TO INCLUDE MORE FOCUSED HARD ON QUALITY. YOU KNOW AN HOUR OF YOGA DOES NOT EQUATE TO AN HOUR OF TRAUMA THERAPY FOR OUR PATIENTS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOGA LOVE YOGA. IT'S NOT THE SAME. REGARDS TO FACILITIES BECAUSE CERTIFICATION IS VOLUNTARY AND NOT CONSISTENT FACILITY STANDARDS ARMED FORCES THE CONDITION OF RUN A PROGRAM. WITHOUT ENSURING THAT BUILDINGS ARE SAFETY CODED EGRESS IS AVAILABLE FOR AN EMERGENCY MEDICATIONS ARE CAPS FOR TRADERS AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURES. JUST TO NAME A FEW PATIENT CARE IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE AT HIGHER RISK OF AND COMPROMISED AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE PUT AT RISK. SANDERS FOR PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES. TO PATIENT OUTCOMES AND JUST AS IMPORTANT ARE THE STANDARD SET FOR PROFESSIONALS PERFORMING THIS LIFESAVING WORK IN THOSE PROGRAMS. WELL TRAINED AND CREDENTIALED COLLECTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO PROVIDING CLINICAL CARE. CALIFORNIA UNLIKE A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES NEW YORK ILLINOIS MINNESOTA WORKING HAS NO MANDATORY SAY OVERSIGHT FUNCTION FOR THE MANY OP PROFESSIONALS TREATING THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. INSTEAD MAINTAINS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THE THIRD PARTY OR XIN THE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS ARE MORE LIMITED THAN WHAT WE SEE IN OTHER STATES. AND IN OTHER PROFESSIONAL WORK IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS SOCIAL WORK OR L. MATISSE. AND THEY ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO DELIVER QUALITY CARE. IN ADDITION EDUCATION SOME OF OTHER HOME STATES- INCLUDE BACKGROUND STUDIES FOR THE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING WITHIN OUR FACILITIES THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WITH THE OTHER PANEL. AND HAVING MORE ROBUST VULNERABLE ADULT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE PROFESSIONS. SO IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY BACKGROUND PRIOR- TO COMING TO HIS WITHIN BETTY FORD I WAS- IN ACUTE CARE. AND SINCE JOINING THE FOUNDATION. I REMAIN REALLY SHOPS AT THE LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION FOCUS ON PATIENT CARE. NOT JUST FOR TWO YEARS BUT THOSE IN A VAULT IN THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE SOBRE HOME OPERATORS RECOVERY PROFESSIONALS IN MORE. IN MY ESTIMATION THIS IS DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THE SPECIALTY EDUCATION FIELD. HAS LONG BEEN MARGINALIZED AND A STEP REMOVED FROM MAINSTREAM HEALTH CARE IT'S NOT INTEGRATED. NOT TAUGHT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL NOT EVEN RECOGNIZED AS A SPECIALTY UNTIL RECENTLY. MY CAPITA SEPARATED WHICH IS ONE REASON THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO EXIST UNDER A LESSER REGULATORY SCHEME. I HOPE TO- PLAY A PART IN CHANGING THAT TODAY AND I THINK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND YOUR LEADERSHIP. WHERE CAN YOU HEAR THANK YOU WHAT YOU SAID ALL I KNOW HOW MUCH BUT FOR ME TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I'M ANY HOMES- I'LL BE BRIEF- USUALLY THERE'S I. SAY USUALLY HAS MORE QUESTIONS THAN THAN WHAT I CAN SAY BUT I'M I AM A AND SHE MEDICINE PHYSICIAN HERE IN SELLING FOREIGN IN THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR TREATMENT PROGRAM. LEVIN LOCATIONS. AND I'M CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DECIDED ADDICTION AS WHICH IS THE STATE CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN SIDE. MESSENGER A SAM. WE ARE THE LARGEST POSITION GROUP THAT REPRESENTS. DOCTORS AND OTHER SOCIAL NOW THAT TO TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS EN EL MY ROLE IN SEIZE MS IS A PUBLIC POLICY CHAIR SO I DO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY FOR THEM I AM ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE POLICY FOR A SAM THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION SO I HAVE WORK HERE CHECK AND I WORK IN WASHINGTON. AND I SIT ON THE BOARD BOTH ORGANIZATIONS- SO ARE INTERESTED IN IN IN IT TODAY'S TOPIC IS SYNCING OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS AS MOST OR MAYBE YOU DON'T THAT CALIFORNIA NOT LAPSES OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE CERTIFIED AND YOU COULD BE CERTIFIED BY BY ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS BUT WE- SEE SAID MY ORGANIZATION AT ADVOCATES TO BE LICENSED AND I THINK INCREASING STATE OUR SITE IS A THING. AND WE SUPPORTED THE BILL. THAT UNFORTUNATE AGO I DIDN'T DID GET DIDN'T. PASSED THROUGH HIM. SUPPORT THE BILL THAT THAT EXISTED THIS YEAR NINE TWENTY AND IF THIS BILL COMES UP AGAIN IF WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS THIS BILL STARTED IN THE SENATE I THINK JERRY WILL START THE BILL AND THEN IT MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY AS BILLS DO. WE ARE ORGANIZATION CERTAINLY WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS AND ON AND I WOULD AND AT LAST YEAR WE WILL CO SPONSOR WHICH MEANS WE ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY FOR THE- FOR MANY THINGS AND I THINK. IF YOU HAVE WILL ENSURE YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT AND WE WOULD THINK THAT. THAT WE ARE OUR ORGANIZATION FEELS. THE ALL EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ALCOHOLISM ADDICTION ISSUES NEED TO BE OFFERED AT TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO GET A LICENSE SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO GOES THROUGH TREATMENT NEEDS TO BE ON MEDICATION THURMOND EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS WHICH YOU'RE NOT MEDICAID USUALLY YOU THINK OF EVENTS PASTRY. THAT INVOLVE MEDICATIONS. THE SUBOXONE BEING THE ONE THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE INJECTABLE- TRAWL IT OR THAT NOW TRICKS ON AND THERE'S ALSO AN INJECTABLE FORM OF THE PEOPLE ARE FEW WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY REALLY GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND- BUT THAT THERE ARE GOOD EVIDENCE PASTRY. FOR OTHER SUBSIDIES- DISORDERS THAT WE HAVE MEDICATIONS WHICH WORK WELL FOR OPIATES AND WE HAVE MEDICATIONS WHICH WORK WELL FOR AL ALL WE HAVE NOTHING FOR METHAMPHETAMINE OR STIMULANTS LIKE COCAINE WE HAVE NOTHING FOR CANNABIS- IN FACT THERE ARE GOOD EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT WHICH DID NOT INVOLVE A DOCTOR OR PRESCRIPTION- CONTINUE TO MANAGEMENT WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT NEED A DOCTOR TO DO A PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WORKS WELL IN STIMULANTS- SO METHAMPHETAMINES WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE HAD. WE HAVE WE HAVE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS WHAT WE THINK THAT WITH MY INSURER WILL BE A LOT OF THE- THE BAD APPLES A LOT OF THE ABUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. BUILT. FOR MILLION LITTLE NOISE WAS JUST HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WE THINK THAT THIS THIS THE LICENSING MOBILE AND A LOT OF. BECAUSE THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO GET A LICENSE ARE GONNA HAVE TO COMPLY WITH STATE. AND IF THEY COMPLY WITH STATE THERE'S THE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE BILL YOU KNOW. ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A POP FOR A URINE TEST WHICH CAUGHT TWENTY BUCKS AND THREE TIMES A WEEK. AND BILL YOU KNOW MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE ALL KNOW EXIST. SO WITH. OUR WORK WE'RE IN VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF LICENSURE- AND AN INCREASING OVERSIGHT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING THIS WILL HELP PEOPLE. THIS WILL KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE. ARE WE OFFERING MEDICATIONS PARTICULARLY NOW IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD. INCREASING ABOUT THAT NOTHING OF FENNEL IS NOW ARRIVING HEALTH. IT WAS HERE WAS NOT HERE EARLIER. IT'S INCREASING WE'RE SEEING INCREASING NUMBER AS FROM FAT NOW. OUR PROBABLY THIS YEAR I THINK FIRST YEAR RUN PIECE. THAT METHAMPHETAMINE DOES WILL NOW EXCEED OPIATE DESK CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE MORE PEOPLE DYING FOR NEW FOR METHAMPHETAMINE THAT WE HAVE FROM OPIATES AND YOU'LL BE DOES A RISING BECAUSE FENTON WAS NOW ARRIVED. PILL FORM. AND SO THE OTHER THE OTHER THING THAT THAT IT IT CAME UP IN THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU SENT ME WORK HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW SO THAT WE HAVE ANY MEDICATIONS WE HAVE AN INJECTABLE FORM. THE BUPRENORPHINE. AND THIS IS THIS I THINK IS A REAL GAME CHANGER BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW. MANY PEOPLE COME OUT OF TREATMENT AND YOU SEE THEM- RIGHT RIGHT WHERE WE SIT YOU SEE PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY PUT ON MEDICATIONS IF THEY HAVE. A HEROIN ADDICTION. AND THE SOBRE LIVES WON'T TAKE A THE CAN'T IT INTO A SOBER LIVING IF YOU'RE ON THESE BUSES FOR THE MEASURE NOT GEARED UP TO DISPENSE MEDICATIONS. SO THEY COME OUT OF TREATMENT STABLE WE CAN'T GET HOUSING WE CAN'T GET IT WAS OVER LIVING THEY GO BACK THE STREET THE STOP THE MEDICATION THEY WERE IS THE OVERDOSE. WITH AN INJECTABLE FORM MEDICATION- WE GIVE THEM A SHOT ONCE A MONTH AND THE SOAP LIVINGS ARE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN STILL LIVE IN THEY COULD LEAVE FOR AFTERNOON COME BY THE OFFICE TO SEE THE NURSE COME TO MY OFFICE GET A SHOP. AND GO RIGHT BACK TO THE SOBER LIVING THEY DON'T SO WILL NOT CHARGE THE MEDICATION AND THEY CAN DO THIS ONCE A MONTH. AND WE CAN HOUSE PEOPLE WE GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET WHO WHO HAVE OPEN TODAY. AND GET THE HOUSE WHICH IS TO KEEP SOME SAFE KEEPS OF DYING- WHICH WE THINK IS GOOD IT WHICH WAS THE COULD BE WILL HELP AND AT AS WELL AS THE OTHER REJECTED ALL THE NOW TRICKS. ON THE PATROL WHICH ALSO WAS A BIG HELP WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE NOW. AND AS FAR AS- THE OTHER QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED. IS ABOUT HOW DO WE FOLLOW PEOPLE. HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE HAVE GOOD OUTCOMES. WERE LICENSE TREATMENT FACILITIES HOW DO WE KNOW. THAT A GOOD JOB. AND STORE KLAY IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT. TO TRACK YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CHRONIC RELAPSING ILLNESS. AS MY HYPERTENSION DIABETES ARE YOU COULD FALL THEM YOU GO TO THE LAB. AND INTO A BLOOD TEST YOU CAN ACHIEVING YOUR OFF TO TAKE THE BLOOD PRESSURE WITH WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALCOHOLISM OR ADDICTIONS VERY FICKLE. HISTORICALLY WE'VE YOU. DRUG TESTING. WE USED THE INTERACTIONS WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T GET ARRESTED FOR A COUPLE YEARS THIS IS USUALLY A SIGN THAT YOU'RE NOT BACK IN THE DROP. UP WE'VE USED ER VISITS AS SORT OF. CIRCUIT MARKERS FOR DRUG USE CHOOSE A LOT OF WAYS WE CAN TEST BESIDES DRUG TESTING- IT IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE A IT'S A VERY. COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND MANY PEOPLE REQUIRE DIFFERENT- TREATMENT MODALITIES TO GET- AND WE ARE YEAH MY ORGANIZATIONS IN FAVOR. I THINK EVERYTHING THAT WORKS WE JUST WANT TO THAT ALL THINGS ARE OFFERED A AT THE TRIAL LEVEL. SO THAT'S IT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. SO THE COUPLE QUESTIONS PRESS START AND YOU I WITH YOU MISS IT A I SEE YOU YOU COMMENTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED AT JUST THE COMPLETE LACK OF REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT OF EITHER PROVIDERS OR AT AS PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YEAH IT'S THE ONLY STATE IT'S THE ONLY STATE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES IN THIS TOTAL LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND IT IS A I HAVE BEEN EQUALLY SHOCKED IS A YOU KNOW THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO LEARN THAT IT'S SHOCKING AND IT IS SHIPPING FALL SO I'M QUESTION I THINK I ASKED YOU WHEN WE'RE CHATTING EARLIER BUT I'D LOVE UNIT YOU SHARE WITH THE GROUP IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO IS DOING A GOOD JOB. AND WHO AND WHERE CAN WE LACK FOR NORTH STAR IT'S. WE TRY TO PUT TOGETHER A FREE MORE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH IT OUT THAT'S A GREAT XIN THERE IS A LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK BEING DONE- WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS IN AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE STATE OF MINNESOTA HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS IT IS AND THIS IDEA OF QUALITY AND THE LICENSING REGULATIONS- NEED OF THE- OF THE DEFAULTS FOUR ON STATE AGENCIES AS DOCUMENTATION RATE BUT- DOCUMENTATION FOR DOCUMENTATION SAKE AND QUALITY. SO WHAT WHAT ARE INDICATORS OF QUALITY WELL I'M YOU KNOW. INDICATORS OF QUALITY ARE- PEOPLE THAT ARE MEASURING THEIR OUTCOMES ARE THEY ARE THEY MEASURING THEM- WITH ADULT OBJECTIVE CRITERIA- ARE THEY- YOU KNOW TING SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY LIKE HAVING. YOUR PROFESSIONAL PROVIDERS THAT ARE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE OF THE COAL CURRYING DISORDERS ARE APPARENT IN YOUR NEARLY A 100% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEE- OUR STATISTICS ARE OF THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WE'RE- TREATING A YEAR- WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR EHR 90% OF THEM HAVE A CO INCURRING. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY DISSOCIATION SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU KNOW THIS IS- THIS REQUIRES THE RIGHT TYPE OF PROVIDER THE RATE TYPE OF SERVICES EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES- THAT THE DOCTOR TALKED ABOUT HERE EIGHT IS SUPER IMPORTANT- ESTAS IN QUALITY AND. SO YOU KNOW MINISTER IS AB ABSOLUTELY- SOMEBODY TO OR IN. THE NORTH TEARS DURING THE TREMENDOUS JOB AND WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE ORGAN SYSTEM ISN'T AT THEY HAVE INVITED THE PUBLIC TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO OUR PREVIOUS PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE IN THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY. BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT THAT- THAT WE BRING IN EXPERTS- OF A MEDICINE THAT WE BRING IN EXPERTS FROM CLINICAL THAT WE BRING IN EXPERTS FROM EVERY CAN BE FROM THE SOBRE HOMES. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CREEK CONTINUUM OF CARE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND THEN AB GEN I HAVE FOR YOU DR. IN OUR PREVIOUS ALL MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THERE IS THE SMARTEST CAN SOMEONE THERE CAN BE A DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE WERE PRACTICING ADDICTION PRINCE OF OUR- OTHER MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS AND THE THIRD YOU KNOW KIND OF TREATING THE IMMEDIATE SOMETIME RATHER THAN LOOKING BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE CAUSE WHAT CAN WE DO TO FORGE A MORE EFFECTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP THERE AND HAVE EVERYBODY. WORKING TOGETHER MORE TO PLAY SO THIS IS THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DR PRACTICES DICTION AND DR THE REST OF THE WORLD WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALMOST ALL MY COLLEAGUES THINKS I'M NUTS I MEAN YOU KNOW I AM IF PEOPLE SEE YOU TAKE YOUR DRUG ADDICTS ALCOHOLICS ARE YOU THINKING ONCE SHE JUST. TAKE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND DIABETES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE ARE LOOKED AT RATHER ODDBALL YOU KNOW WE ARE KIND OF OUT LIARS AND PART OF THAT BECAME BECAUSE MANY OF THE EARLY PIONEERS IN ADDICTION TREATMENT CAME OUT OF THE ROOM REMOVED SELF THEY WERE IN RECOVERY AND THEY THEY CAME. THEY WERE LIKE THE RADICS WE WERE THE LAST PLACE TO PRACTICE KNOWN AS ONE OF THEM SO YEAH IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO A LOT OF THAT REGION EDUCATION. WITH WITH OPIATES I BEING WITH. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO REMOVE STE I'M IN THE STATE IS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THAT. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE PEOPLE WEBSITE THE STORE THEY DON'T TAKE YOUR DRUG ADDICTS. AND SO WE DO A LOT OF WORK ORGANIZATIONS HE'S AS A LOT ABOUT REGION IN AND GET FULL TO COMMUNICATE. I THINK WITH THE ADS OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS THERE'S ALSO. THERE'S ALSO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEDERAL. PROHIBITION HEARING INFORMATION SO THIS IS A OF HIPAA AND THERE'S ENOUGH TO SEE FOR PART TWO WHICH ARE TWO SEPARATE LAW. FEDERAL LAW VERSUS STATE LAW TERMS SHARING. SO IF I HAVE A- SOME OF MY OFFICE AND I HAVE A. A MONSTER BOX ON AND I SPEND ALL DAY EVERY DAY IT TREATING PATIENTS WITH IT WITH ADDICTION ALCOHOLISM. I COLLEAGUES CAN'T ALWAYS SEE THAT NOTE. SO IF I SEND SOMEONE OVER TO GET IT IF THEY HAVE A HERNIA AND I SEE YOU NEED A HERNIA REPAIR I SEE YOU NEED YOUR COLONOSCOPY AND I SAID I'M OVER THAT IT'S HARD SOMETIMES FOR THOSE DOCTORS LOOK AT THE DATA BECAUSE THERE ARE FEDERAL RULES THAT PROHIBIT THE SHARING OF DATA WE OPERATE A SILO. AND THE FEDERAL FEDERAL LAW TRUMPS STATE LAW AND SO WE HAVE TO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS NOW THERE'S SOME FEDERAL REGULATION BEING CHANGED TO ALLOW SHARING INFORMATION BUT SOME OF IT IS JUST LAW SAYS I CAN'T. I CAN'T PUT STUFF ON A CHART THAT ANOTHER DOCTOR CAN SEE. QUESTIONS RATHER MEMBERS. NOT A QUESTIONNAIRE IT REALLY GO SIDE TO. JENNIFER WE'VE HAD REALLY GOOD COMMUNICATION- WITH STATE OF FLORIDA AND THE STATE ATTORNEY UBER DAVE CURRENT BURKE I BELIEVE WHAT SOLVE THEIR SUCCESS WITHIN OF THE BILLS THAT WE'VE TRIED IN YOU KNOW GOD HIMSELF BUT NOT OVER THE LINE INCLUDING KILEY PETER IS THE LAST ONE. THAT HAVE YOU HAD ANY. EXPERIENCE WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND EIGHTY FORD OF BECAUSE- THEY PUT TOGETHER A TASK FORCE WHICH I THINK IS THE BEGINNING IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM LAST YEAR WHEN ASSEMBLYMAN. ARKADY HE JUST WENT AWAY SO. I'M JUST GONNA CALL YOU CARTY OKAY YOU CAN CALL ME PAT. BAD TO IN ANY WAY THAT SHE STARTED ABOUT I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON THERE THAT THEY HAD ON THERE IS AND MAYBE THAT SOMETHING THAT. WILL BE ON OUR HER TO DO LIST FOR NEXT YEAR. GET BACK TOGETHER BUT HAVE YOU HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH THEM BECAUSE ON THREE OF THE BILLS I THINK THAT- WE'VE AUTHORED- FEEL ABOUT FIVE DIDN'T MAKE IT IT IT IT BACK THERE LIKE. MINE DOES DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES SOFTWARE WHEN. ON OUR BECAUSE HE WAS PUT IN THE WRONG PLACE AND HE ACTUALLY TO. AT THE END OF IT. AND LEAVE OUT WAS THE REASON THAT THE PARENTS WERE LURED INTO THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY WITH A- MARKETING AND WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN ON IT CETERA ETCETERA AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO. YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING THAT WE MIGHT. TAKE WITH A FIVE READ THE NEXT YEAR. YEAH HE'S LINDA ACTUALLY THE FACILITY IN FLORIDA AND THE- FLORIDA SO- WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE- EVOLUTION. OF THE REGULATIONS IN FLORIDA AND- YOU KNOW REALLY THE- THE- THE DECEPTIVE PRACTICES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSFERRING HERE TO. THERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF WORK- WITH THAT BROAD SECTION THAT I TALKED ABOUT HAVING- EVERYBODY IN THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM AT THE TABLE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES LAW ENFORCEMENT. I MEAN THIS IS A COMMUNITY. FAMILY DISEASE AND IT TAKES A COMMUNITY AND THE FAMILY AND IF YOU KNOW WHICH INCLUDES THE PROVIDERS IN THE SCHOOLS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TOGETHER TO SAUL. ON THIS IS A REALLY COMPLEX ISSUE BUT ONE OF THE YEAH WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE- THE PROSECUTORIAL ON DETERRENCE. HELP IN FLORIDA YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT JUST PUTTING LAWS IN PLACE BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. ENFORCING THOSE LAWS AND THEIR PUBLICIZING THOSE LAWS AND- YOU KNOW I'LL EVEN GIVE CREDIT OUTS THE MEDIA THE MEAT I HAS BEEN. REALLY REALLY GOOD AT- REPORTING ON SOME OF THE ABUSES THAT THAT HAPPENED IN SOUTHERN CAL- IT SOUTHERN- FLORIDA AS WELL- AND SHINING A LIGHT ON THE- ON THE NECESSITY FOR THIS. YOU KNOW IT AND UNFORTUNATELY- YOU KNOW UP AB ABUSES LIKE THIS LATE DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES- ADDICTION TREATMENT- SEPARATE AND APART FROM YOUR OTHER HEALTH CARE. IS NOT CONTROLLABLE BY. ANYBODY IT'S GENERALLY CONSUMER DRIVEN. AND GENERAL WHEN YOU'RE IN A STATE OF CHAOS. YEAH THE FAMILY UNIT DOESN'T IN A STATE OF CHAOS OR- THERE'S A LICENSURE ISSUE THERE YOUR ATTORNEY OR OF ITS- AIRLINE PILOT OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF LICENSED PROFESSIONAL. AND SO THE FIREMAN'S IS A RIGHT FOR THAT THOSE WITH THE FLASH'S WEBSITE. TO CAPTURE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AS OPPOSED TO IF YOU HAVE DIABETES OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR SOME OTHER KIND OF CONDITION. AND YOU HAVE A NAVIGATOR THAT KNOWS THE SYSTEM KNOWS WHERE- YOU CAN GO TO GET THE BEST TREATMENT- BECAUSE YOU KNOW TREATMENT WORKS AND RECOVERY IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE. BUT IT GETS FUZZY WITH. THIS YOU KNOW THESE DECEPTIVE PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING SO ABSOLUTELY A PARTNERSHIP AMONG ALL OF THESE GROUPS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN LICENSING IS A BIG PART OF IT I MEAN FLORIDA HAS LICENSING FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE. AND THEY HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR PROVIDERS. SO YOU KNOW WE CAN GET THERE TOO. I AB NINE TWENTY AND MY FOR BOTH WERE VIDAK BUT BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF IN FORCE I THINK THAT WAS WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP IS THE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. SEEM TO ME WHAT WE NEED TO CONTACT FIVE SOMETHING THAT PROVIDE. ENFORCEMENT THAT MAYBE WE OUT. TO THE LOW LEVEL WITH SOME STATE PENDING OR MATCHING. I KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO BE SPEAKING LATER AND MIGHT. DRESS THAT ISSUE BECAUSE BOTH MALES IN PARTICULAR I THINK NINE TWENTY WAS REALLY GOING AN ODD GREAT DIRECTION THAT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNED ABOUT COST OF ENFORCEMENT IT GOT BE DOING IN MY LISTEN MATTER OF REACHING OUT TO A THIRD PARTY THAT MIGHT BE DOING THE- ADVERTISING FOR. AN HOUR. AN ORGANIZATION WE CAN GO AFTER THE THIRD PARTY WOULD HAVE TO BE THE SPECIFIC PROVIDERS SO WE'LL WE'RE WORKING ON OFFICE BECAUSE THERE'S A PATH THERE I'M NOT SURE ON SB I MEAN AB NINE. TWENTY THERE WAS A PATHWAY BECAUSE OF THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES SO. WE'RE PARTNERS WITH YOU TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET THAT FUNDING FOR YOU ON THAT BILL. THANK YOU DOCTOR SHE THANKS I THINK WELL THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT THE SUBSTANTIAL. CLEARLY THE COST OF DOING NOTHING MORE IS A LOT MORE YEAH. I AND MY HAD A COMMENT I'M- JUST COMMON ONE OF THE THINGS AND- THESE. HEARING IN ARE EITHER HELD IN THE DISTRICT UP AT THE STATE. AND WE DO THE PUBLIC THAT JOINS US HERE AND SOMETIMES AT THE STATE IT'S REALLY I THINK IN MANY WAYS MEANT FOR THE LEGISLATORS TO LEARN THE INFORMATION BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER INSTITUTIONS IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GO TO- LEGISLATORS SCHOOL YES YOU LEARN ABOUT POLICY SO THANK YOU TO THE SPEAKERS BECAUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION. AND THEN EACH TIME I'M- YOU HEAR ABOUT THE ISSUE YOU GAIN MORE BUT CERTAINLY TO MY COLLEAGUES THEY ALWAYS KNOW BILL NEVER DIES SO I CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT YOU'LL BRING UP THE BILLS THAT WERE VETOED BACK WITH THE BUT I ALSO THINK JUST FROM HEARING THE PANELIST. AND WE'RE ALSO HAVE ONE TO COME THE NEXT PANELIST I'VE ALREADY HEARD IN MY NOTES OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATION AND HAD I NOT PARTICIPATED I MAY NOT HAVE THAT FIRSTHAND. BUT I WILL SAY THE ONE KEY WORD THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE AWAY ALREADY FOR MY WHAT I'VE HEARD IS STILL NOT. AN AS WERE TALKING ABOUT ADDICTION. IT GOES IT PAYS TO ONE KIND OF IMAGE BUT IF YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WITH THE BREAST CANCER OR SOMEBODY. WITH AS WE SAY DIABETES OR HEART ATTACK IT GOES IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND WHEN WE HAVE SOMEBODY A NEIGHBOR OR A FAMILY MEMBER- WE'VE JUST HEARD- THERE HAVE REX BREAST CANCER WE START OUR FACEBOOK GROUPS TO BRING MEALS IN OUR CHURCH GROUPS AND- SURROUND THEM WITH LOVE AND- HUGS. BUT WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT ADDICTION. IT BRINGS IN THIS THING LIKE WHAT DID THAT FAMILY DO WERE THEY NOT THERE. UP MOTHER NOT THE RIGHT MOTHER ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS AND WHEN WE SEPARATED MEDICALLY. I MEAN IT IS A DISEASE ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH THOSE ARE A DISEASES BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE WAY THEY ARE- THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS FRAMED- IN MANY WAYS THEY'RE TAUGHT IT'S SECONDARY TO A HEALTH CONDITION. AND AS WHAT I SEE HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND IS ONE ISSUE LEADS TO ANOTHER SO SOMEBODY MIGHT STRUGGLE WITH FIRST WEATHER BE ALCOHOLISM OR- ENDS BUT THEN THAT STARTS TO DETERIORATE ON ONLY PHYSICALLY. SO THEY HAVE OF COURSE HEALTH ISSUE. BUT THEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO I AM MORE THAN EVER MOTIVATED FOR US AS A TEAM UP HERE TO CONTINUE TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC RECEIVES. BUT ALSO THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE GAINED HERE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT- BECAUSE WE LOSE ALL TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE UNDER UMBRELLAS THAT WE PUT PEOPLE AND SO WHETHER IT'S ADDICTION WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW AN ORANGE COUNTY OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE LOST FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE JUST ST ORANGE. ORANGE IN HOMELESS BUT HOW MANY OF THEM ALSO WERE ADDICTED AND HAVE HEALTH ISSUES AND SO FORTH. SO I'M- LIKE I'M IN PLACE. I AM EXACTLY EIGHT TO BE ABLE TO AND I ACTUALLY I WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE I. WAS ON A PLANNED TRIP IN BECAUSE OF A MIGRAINE SO THERE'S ANOTHER I HAD THE TURN SO I MEANT TO BE HERE TODAY. SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN APPS AND DATA. Q. TO FOR ALSO ASKING FOR BEING HERE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR HEIGHT AND ALL YOUR SUPPORT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND CALL UP OUR THIRD PANEL ON THE. THE FOCUS OF OUR THIRD PANEL IS LAW ENFORCEMENT HOW CAN RESPOND TO UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS WILL BE HEARING FROM MAYOR KATRINA FULLY. UP FRONT TRACY HUSING WHO IS THE SENIOR SENIOR DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND FROM JEFF POWELL ACT WHO IS THE ASSISTANT SHARE. ALSO HEARING FROM. THE FULLY WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH THAT WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE. FOR THANK YOU FOR AT LETTING US HOSTS THIS IMPORTANT HEARING HERE TODAY I JUST A LITTLE BIT. EVAN INTRODUCTION SO. I GREW UP IN IT WITH AN ABUSIVE STEPFATHER WHO WAS AN ALCOHOLIC MY MOM HAS BEEN SOBER SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER BUT YOU KNOW SHE GOT TO GO INTO SPACE OVER LIVING HOME IN SANTA BARBARA WAS CONNECTED TO COTTAGE HOSPITAL WHERE- IT WASN'T ALL ABOUT MONEY AND INSURANCE AND- THANK YOU REALLY. IT WAS ABOUT TRYING TO HELP THE WOMEN WHO LIVED THERE SO THERE IS A PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND A NEED FOR GOOD QUALITY OPERATORS BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND WE'RE GONNA START OUR SLIDESHOW OF AREA- WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN PARTICULAR IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAS CAUGHT UP IN OUR CITY TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR IN LITIGATION AGAINST ABUSIVE SOBER LIVING HOME OPERATORS- SO COSTA MESA. I YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT EARLIER BUT WE- GAVE IN WITH A NOW WE HAVE EIGHT. IS THAT OUR STATE YES. AND WHAT WHAT. DEAN. IS A SET FROM A CROSS THE COUNTRY AGGRESSIVE ARE ADVERTISED IN FOR THAT. BE HAPPY RIVIERE. SURE NO PROBLEM THE BILL PAY FOR YOU SURE NOTES. THEY WILL BUY A ONE WAY TICKET- BUT RETURN SO WE END OF CREATING AN ORDINANCE AND WE'VE UPDATED THAT ORDINANCE A COUPLE OF TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN EXCITED. OF SO OUR ORDINANCE WE BELIEVE IS A GOOD MODEL AND IT IS A COMMONSENSE LAW I'VE BEEN IT'S AN TAX. IN THE ASSEMBLY HALL AS WELL. HE IF I HAVE IT SEX OF YOUR FILE FELL IS DEAL FROM OPERATING LIVING WE HEARD CARE FOR PANEL BUT THAT GOODS. IT PROVIDES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SUPER VISION APP PATIENTS. EVENTS BEING AN ORDINANCE AS YOU CAN THAT. MYERS AT IF BY THAT INTO IT TRANSPORTATION THE FIRST TO COP TO ASSUME THERE SOMEONE I'M- YOU HAVE. AS FOR THEIR RETURN GO BACK HOME THEIR SUPPORT WORK AND FAMILY. WE HAVE A NOTE SEE AN NEIGHBOR POLICY. WE HAVE A MEASURE THAT. DISTANCE REMEDY THAT PREVENT IS TO SHIP SAGE OF REPRESENTS SPACE REQUIREMENTS SIX FIFTY IT UP AND THEN WE'RE. IT CAN TO PROTECTING THE CHANCE. THE CHARACTER OF THE CITY'S EVER HEADS THAT WE GO BACK TO THE COMMENTS FROM CELL IS IT SAL ABOUT. THE COMMUNITY AND BUILD A POSITIVE PLACE NEXT. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE- TO ENCOURAGE OPERATOR FIRST. THE GOOD OPERATOR TEXAS VISUAL RECORD THREE THE REST COMES CLEAN COVER FIRE AND THE NEW MINIMIZE PRIME THE WAY DRUG USE AND SURE PEOPLE COVER YOU CAN LIVE. COOPER FIRST DO SO I THINK BE HEARD HERE TODAY. WHITE PEOPLE OKAY THERE'S NO REGULATION HOWEVER NOTE OVER EIGHT TO LIVE ON FOR CRAP THANK. HE'S FOR SEX OFFENDERS WE SENT ONE FEDERAL COURT CASE. JUSTIN JACK WHERE THEY WHERE ONE OF THE. I OP INSTEAD WAS THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT OR IS THAT WOULD ALLOW SEX. TWO SEVEN. THAT ORDER IS THIS WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE SAID. DISAGREED THEM FORTUNATELY I'M COMING. I'M PRETTY SURE FRAUD AND THEN OF COURSE MEDICATION MAN RESULTING IN A XIN FOR DOES DEATH AND THESE ARE NOT ALL SPECULATIVE THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. NEXT SLIDE. WE HAVE SEVEN THE SERVER LIVING HOME LAWSUIT THAT ARE CURRENTLY STILL TING. ALL ARE. I'M MORE IN FEDERAL COURT RIGHT NOW WE'VE HAD A WE HAD A HIGHER DESPITE LIES EFFORT. HE TO HANDLE THIS THE XIN BREATH. AND WE HAVE. AN EXTRA SEVEN IS LITIGATION AND COVERAGE. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED WHAT WE LEARNED THAT PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION ARE VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION ABOUT OPERATORS I THINK EVERY THE PANEL THEY HAVE AS THAT. READERS WILL STOP NOTHING RIGHT RIGHT THE SHIN DIG INTO CYCLE EXPLOITING THEIR VICTIMS MANSION AND WE HEARD. ALL OF THE PAST AS TO ARE WORKING IN THESE INDUSTRIES A THEY'RE NOT AFRAID REGULAR. I'M AFRAID OF LIFE THANK YOU SOME ART I'M THOSE FIRST YEAH THANKS BYE SEVEN ARE YOURS BECAUSE THEY WANT US TO HAVE A IN ORDER. THE THIRD. DROP REPRESENT THIS BUT WELCOME RIGHT TIONS. US SO WE I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS INDIVIDUALLY BUT WE DID- WE'VE IDENTIFIED WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF HARM INDUSTRY PRACTICE YOU KNOW THE RECYCLING OF PATIENTS THIS. IDEA THAT IT'S A MODEL OF RELAPSE INSTEAD OF BEING A MODEL OF RECOVERY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NEVER GOING TO A RESTAURANT IF WE IF WE DON'T BREAK THIS AT. THIS AT GOAL. I LOVE TO LAUGH. FOR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT DR INDEED IT THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE SCRAPPED. I THINK HE'S THAT YOU. SEN. LIMÓN BUT THERE IS AN EIGHT SOME SEVEN. THERE ARE TRADE PERFECT. AND WE ARE DYING. SURE BROUGHT MONEY LAUNDERING OPERATOR OUR FAULT SO FAR. IN TERMS TO TRIGGER BRIDGE SERVER IS RIGHT THERE IN THE. PATIENT BROKER. U. S. G. NORRIS FOR YOUR BILL AB IN NINETEEN THAT EXIST FORCED TOOL TO ADD SENATOR- AS OF AN- APPROPRIATE. BUT THAT. AND WE JUST HEARD. I KNOW IT IS A FROM RECEIVE JESTER AS THE EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND WRITING ON FISH THE CURBING AND WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING AT THAT. TWENTY SIX PER CENT OF RESIDENTS WERE LIVING IN OUR HOME. SHELVE ARE PEOPLE FROM. ADDICTION TREATMENT OF THE REASON THAT IF YOU CROSS. OUT WE SEE EXPOSURE OF PEOPLE THOMAS I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED ISN'T THIS HOW DO KLAY RELATED BETWEEN THESE. CURBING PEOPLE EXCITED. HOW DO THEY RECYCLE PATIENTS BASICALLY THE PATIENT ENTERS THE FACILITY AND THEN THERE'S THE REHAB IS THIS THE READ THE LIVING THIS IS MONEY FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY. AND THEN. THEY HAD NOT DAIS DAY THE TRICK IS AND THEN SOME THE PATIENTS ARE EXPOSED TO DRUGS AND IN OUR TO GET BANDS WE HAVE TO COVER THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE RIGHT WAY THAT THERE'S THIS MATTER EXPOSURE. TO THESE PATIENTS IN ADDITION. TO GET TO COME BACK TO THE FIRST THE AND START THE CYCLE ALL OVER AGAIN AND THAT IS THE MARK OF REAL APPS. I'M NOT RECOVER A SIDE. I'M THE DRUG STATE INSURANCE FRAUD. IN OUR BRIEF. HAS IT TWICE IF YOU THREE TWO WEEKS I THINK. TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW ONE IS PRETTY MUCH FISH NO THESE ARE DRUGS IF YOU WERE USING IF DO IT TWICE YOUR I GET THE MEMBER. THE END. ADDITION NOT ONLY ARE THEY. ESTATE AND WE HAVE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THAT MULTIPLE TIMES THEY'RE ALL SO USING THE SAMPLES IN THERE SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THE LAB AND THEY'RE GETTING A PAYMENT FROM THE LAB AS WELL SLIDE. SO THAT BECOMES THIS WHOLE. INSURANCE ARE THE GAMES THAT HAPPENING THERE. SAM OR TAKE FROM WHAT IF IT WOULD BE IF AND THEY'RE TO ANOTHER LAB THEN MY SIT BACK TO THE FACILITY WE WERE IN CAMP WAS WERE TAKE. THE ALL THE GROUPS BOB. AFFECT OFF IS YOUR TESTS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE NEEDS LIKE. WORK ON THIS AS AN ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT EXCITED. I'M THE INSURANCE COMPONENT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT I'M. THERE'S THREE SENT MARK THE SITE THAT THE- THE WHAT I HAVE OVER LOOKED COMES CONNECTED TO TREATMENT CENTER. AND SO. HE MADE SEVERAL COME AND COLLECT THE MONEY. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE INSURANCE IS. TREAT SENT HER AND IT IS CENTER IS KING. BACK TO THE LIVING WHICH. HE DOESN'T KNOW THE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT PAYMENT IS BEING MADE TO SO. ANOTHER SERIOUS I INSURANCE CONCERNED THAT I DO HOPE THAT THE STATE LOOKS INTO YOU NEXT SLIDE. AS WE TALKED EARLIER MEDICATION MANAGED ON A FIGHT PEOPLE. CATION AND NOT VERY DRESSED FIVE. SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED AS PART OF OUR LITIGATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND IT'S NOT SPECULATIVE IT'S NOT BASED ON DISCRIMINATORY- BELIEVES IT BASED ON. ABOUT ABUSIVE OPERATORS TRYING TO EXPLOIT VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND ALSO JUST MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE OFF OF THE INSURANCE SO I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK- YOU THREE WOMEN HAVE DONE GREAT WORK TO HELP US ADD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE LICENSING ISSUES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN SHARON QUIRK SILVA FOR PARTNERING WITH ME A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO. ADDRESS LIES SAYING AND THANK YOU. HI PETRIE-NORRIS FOR HELPING NOW AND WE SUPPORTED AB NINE TWENTY WHERE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN TAKE SOME FURTHER PROGRESS WITH. AND SENATOR IT'S THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF EFFORTS SPACE AS WELL KATE ALL THAT WORK AND WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE OUR STAFF AND OUR- WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO YOU THAT. THAT ACTUALLY IS THE DATA THAT GOES TO THESE FLIGHTS. THANK YOU MAYOR FALLING. I BELIEVE TO ADDRESS HUGHES. SO I'M TRACY HERE THANK YOU I'M A SENIOR DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE ORANGE COUNTY DA'S OFFICE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH OUR OFFICES SOBER LIVING ADDICTION TREATMENT TASK FORCE SINCE IT STARTED AND I WAS THE PRIMARY DRAFTER AT DICTION TREATMENT REGISTRATION AND DISCLOSURE ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED BY. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LAST NOVEMBER. OUR OFFICE IS COMMITTED TO FIGHTING FRAUD RELATED TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. MISTER SPITZER UNDERSTANDS THAT UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS ARE TARGETING VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS ARE SUFFERING DUE TO THE HUGE PROLIFERATION OF SUB PAR FACILITIES. WE HAVE A CASE RIGHT NOW AND THE FIVE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AND WE FELT THAT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE HAVE A TRIAL DATE JUNE OF NEXT YEAR FOR DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES CONTRIBUTING TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AND OUR OFFICE NOW HAS ALLOCATED SEVEN PEOPLE TO THE SOBER LIVING TEAM ADDICTION TREATMENT TASK FORCE. AND I JUST WANNA SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER CASES WE HANDLE AND OUR OFFICE NORMALLY WE GET REFERRALS FROM POLICE AGENCIES SO IF THERE'S A SEXUAL ASSAULT OR AND HOMICIDE OR SOMETHING. THE POLICE AGENCY WILL INVESTIGATE THAT CASE THE DETECTIVES GO OUT. I DO ALL THE INVESTIGATION THEY BRING IT TO OUR OFFICE FOR FILING. WE FOUND THE CASE AND WE TAKE THE CASE TO TRIAL SO THEY ARE THE PRIMARY ON THE GROUND INVESTIGATORS FOR THOSE CASES. AND OUR INVESTIGATORS ASSIST AND ARE BRINGING THE CASE TO TRIAL IN PROSECUTING THE CASES AND MAYBE SOME FOLLOW UP. BUT FOR THESE CASES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO COMPLICATED AND SO DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE TYPICALLY SEE. WE ARE WORKING ON THESE CASES FROM THE INSIDE SO OUR TEAM IS INVESTIGATING THESE CASES FROM THE GROUND UP FRONT TIPS WE HAVE WE'VE HAD I THINK A HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN TENTHS TO THE TIP LINE SO FAR. AND THEY ARE BUILDING THESE CASES INVESTIGATING THESE CASES. PREPARING THEM FOR PROSECUTION. THAT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL AND IT'S VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE- A COUPLE OF THE CASES THAT WE HAVE ON GOING ONE WAS FILED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND INVOLVES. YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN IRAQ FROM OUR CASE AND THE SCHEMATIC THAT. FOLEY SHOWED YOU IT INVOLVED A URINALYSIS SCHEME AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY WE HAVE ALLEGED AT TESTING SOBER LIVING RESIDENTS YEAR AND MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY NOT ACTUALLY SENDING IT TO THE LAB BUT BILLING INSURANCE FOR THE TASKS- MULTIPLE TIMES AND I THINK THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF LOSS WAS TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. SO TWO OF THOSE AT DEFENDANTS HAVE PLED GUILTY ONE HAS PASSED AWAY AND THERE TO THAT ARE AWAITING TRIAL. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CASES THAT ON GOING I ANOTHER'S. SCHEME THAT THE TEAM INVESTIGATED FROM THE GROUND UP AND AGAIN VERY COMPLICATED MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ENTITIES LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLAYERS. AND NOT WAS THE SERVER LIFE USA CASE. THAT WAS FILED LAST YEAR THEIR LEVIN CODEFENDANTS AND THAT INVOLVES- FRAUDULENT SURGICAL PROCEDURES. THAT THEY WERE TELLING PAGE PATIENTS WE HAVE ALLEGED I THAT WOULD ADDRESS THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION BUT THIS IS A NON FDA APPROVED TREATMENT WHEREBY THEY SURGICALLY IMPLANTED ON TRUCKS AND PALLET IN PEOPLE. NOT FDA APPROVED- AND THEY WERE CHARGING THEY WERE GIVING WE HAVE A LEADS TO THE PATIENTS ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. AT TO COME IN AND UNDERGO THE PROCEDURE THEN BILLING THE INSURANCE COMPANY UP TO FORTY THOUSAND A POP FOR THESE PEOPLE COMING IN. SO THEIR LEVIN CO DEFENDANTS IN THAT CASE TWO OF THEM HAVE PLAYED GUILTY THE REST ARE ON THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN SO. OUR INVESTIGATORS IN OUR TEAM PUT THESE CASES TOGETHER. BUT THEY'RE ALSO HAVING TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION SO THAT MEANS GETTING THEM READY FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING AND TRIAL. SO WITH EACH ADDITIONAL CASE IN OUR OFFICE COMES ALL OF THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH PUTTING THOSE CASES ON. SO IT'S VERY RESOURCE INTENT INTENSIVE AND WE WOULD WELCOME ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER LINE FORCE IN IN. HELPING TO BUILD THESE CASES ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED FROM TALKING TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN FLORIDA. WELL AS THEY HAVE ASSEMBLED A TEAM INSIDE THE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE HELPING WITH THE INVESTIGATION. AND BUILDING IN THESE CASES. I'M. SO OUR OFFICE IN MISTER SPITZER UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH FRAUD IN THE INDUSTRY ARE COMPLEX. AND HE IS COMMITTED TO VIGOROUS PROSECUTIONS OF THE CASES WITH THE TOOLS WE HAVE. BUT AT. WHEN ECHO WHAT WE'VE HEARD ON THE PANEL TODAY THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED AREA AND IT REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT JUST PROSECUTIONS ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO. MORE ROBUST REGULATIONS SO THAT WE HAVE THE TOOLS FOR THOSE PROSECUTIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STANDARDS SO THAT FAMILIES WHEN THEY'RE EVALUATING HOW THEY CAN GET HELP FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THEY CAN DECIDE IS THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL WILL HELP THEM OR NOT AND RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS SO I'M IN THAT SECOND PRONG OF LEGISLATION WE APPLIED. FELICE. ORDINANCE AND ALSO WE WORKED ON THIS ADDICTION TREATMENT. JUST REGION ORDINANCE THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR AND IT IS NEAR AFTER I HAVE LAW AS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS A VULNERABLE GROUP OF PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO HAVE EXTRA PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. PART OF THE LICENSING PROCESS REQUIRES THEM TO DISCLOSE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OTHER ENTITIES SO IF YOU. RECALL THAT SLIDE WITH THE DIFFERENT THE LAB IN THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES IT'S COMMON FOR THESE UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS TO HAVE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ALL OF THOSE PIECES SO THEY'RE COLLECTING AT EVERY STAGE AND THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILY DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING SO. OUR ORDINANCE TRIED TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THAT AS WELL AS HAVING THE REGISTER SO WE HAVE. AN IDEA OF JUST USE OPERATING OUT THERE. I'M. SO THREE PRONGED APPROACH ECHOING WHAT THE PANEL SAYS I WE HAVE BEGAN TO TALK WITH STAKEHOLDERS I SEE SOMEONE FROM SAFER OUR ACTS WHICH IS THE- SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HI ANTI PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE TEAM WE HAVE AN ORANGE COUNTY THAT YOU SEE I STARTED IN THE AUDIENCE. HELLO DOCTOR AND WE ARE TRYING TO REACH OUT WITH AND TALK TO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO WORK ON. HOPING WITH THE STANDARD PIECE OF THIS THAT WERE READY TO PROSECUTE CASES AND WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THEM. THANK YOU. AND ASSISTANT SHERIFF POWER. ONE THANK YOU UP MY NAME IS JEFF ALEC I AM THIS IS SYSTEM SHERIFF I OVERSEE OUR FIELD OPERATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS COMMAND WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY ONE PATRON ORDERS FOR INCLUDING US THIS THIS PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT. THE DAY MANY THE CITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE PREVALENCE OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES. I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE AND SHARE THE HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THE CITY'S SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT JURISDICTION. I'M SURE WITH YOU THE PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR LINE LEVEL TROLL DEPUTIES THAT ARE RESPONDING TO CALLS FOR SERVICE. SO FOR CITY LIKE THE HIGHLIGHTS THE CITY OF SAN KHAMENEI AS FROM WHAT WE'RE AWARE OF TWENTY FIVE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT HOMES. SEVENTEEN OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE HOMES. RECEIVED ONE MORE CALLS FOR SERVICE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. ONE HOME IN PARTICULAR HAS AT THIRTEEN CALLS FOR SERVICE. IN THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD AND ONE HOMES HAD SEVENTEEN WAS FOR PURPOSE AND A TWO YEAR PERIOD. OF THE CITY OF BEING A POINT IS A PARTNER TO THE NORTH ON THEY HAVE OVER THIRTY HOMES THAT WERE AWARE. HALF OF WHICH OF HAD CALL OR HAD MULTIPLE CALLS FOR SERVICE IN THAT SAME TWO YEAR PERIOD. THE TYPES OF CALLS TO RECEIVE THESE HOMES RUN THE GAMUT AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ONLY OF LIFE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. WELL THE IMPACTS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD MAYBE STE MADE SIGNIFICANT THE FORCE OF LAW IS OFTEN NEARLY A CITATION OR A NUISANCE VIOLATION. THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT MEASURE LEAVES NEIGHBORS POWERLESS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS POSED BY THESE BUSINESSES. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACTS TO RESIDENTS AREAS. IMPROPERLY RUN TREATMENT FACILITIES A FEW ARE HOMELESS AND ADDICTION IS INDIVIDUALS WHO FELT PROGRAMS OFTEN BECOME TOMORROW'S HOMELESS. THE MORE FRUSTRATING THINGS FOR RESIDENTS IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BE TOLD NOTHING CAN BE DONE. TEARS FORMER WILL ISSUE CITATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO CALLS- WILL WORK TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BUT WITHOUT A PROPER REGULATORY BACKBONE. FOR THE STREET EFFORTS CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF AB NINETY NINE NINETEEN AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN THAT YOU NORRIS WHICH REQUIRES THAT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. PREVENT AND STOP BODY BROKERING SCHEMES WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL RECONSIDER SUPPORTING THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND EIGHTY NINE TWENTY WHICH REQUIRES. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO BE LICENSE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OVER SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT INDUSTRY. IS VITAL AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE IMPACTS OF AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. CONTINUE TO SEE A HIGH PREVALENCE OF GOITRE IN ORANGE COUNTY. IN PARTICULAR FEDERAL LEVEL ONCE CONTINUES TO GROW. AS WE WORK TO COMBAT THIS ADDICTION CRISIS WE NEED A BUS SINCE ABUSE TREATMENT INDUSTRY THAT IS BOTH ETHICAL AND RESPECTFUL OF THEIR NEIGHBORS WE KNOW OUR MANY GOOD FACILITIES THAT EXISTS BUT WHEN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORT TO REGULATE OUT THAT ACTORS. SURE BARNES RECOGNIZE IS ALL SCHOOL WHICH HAS BEEN REITERATED ON THE PANEL THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED. SITUATION COMPLICATED TO SAUL BUT HE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT BUT WE AS LONG COURSE OF MUST STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN. THE OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE SERVE. THANKS AND SO. QUESTION ALL OF YOU KNOW I'M- PRETTY OPEN AND MAYBE JUST GIVE ME THAT THE TOP ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN WE DO AS STATE POLICYMAKERS TO HELP. YOU DO YOUR WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY. THERE'S THREE THINGS DO ONE YOU COULD WORK WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PRESS THE INSURANCE ABUSES AND- SO THAT CITIES ARE BURDENED WITH. REVENUE AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCE HAVING USE OUR MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT. TO CERTAINLY A LIGHT SING AND PERMITTING AND READY TORY SCHEME THIS CALL GOAL TO THIS INDUSTRY. AND OF THREE ALLOW LOCAL ENTITIES TO REGULATE WHICH RIGHT NOW THAT IS CAUSING A LOT OF LITIGATION AS THERE IS THIS TENSION BETWEEN EXACTLY CAM LOCALS REGULATE VERSES WHAT IS. PREEMPTED BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN FLORIDA THEY WERE ABLE TO GET PAST THE BODY BROKERING LÀ BUT IT'S FELONY AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE AN ASSEMBLY LINE OF THE BROKERS THAT THERE. IN THROUGH AND THEY'RE REALLY IMPACTING THEIR RATES SO ANYTHING YOU DO IN SACRAMENTO TO. IF SOME OF THESE NEW LAST AND TEETH WOULD HELP US AS PROSECUTORS. I THINK THAT ARE YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT THAT YES THE PROSECUTION. PROSECUTORIAL DETERRENCE IN FLORIDA HAS MADE AN ADAM MEANINGFUL IMPACTS YEAH. THE MOST IT'S BEEN HIT SO FAR BUT I WOULD SAY THAT PROPER REGULATORY BACKGROUND IS P. THAT'S NUMBER ONE- I WOULD ALSO SAY OR THE TO DETERMINE ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT NEEDING HELP YOU KNOW ANY TYPE OF FUNDING FOR PERSONAL TO DO WHETHER IT'S A TASK FORCE MODEL OR SOMETHING WE CAN- RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY TO. THIS TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE HELPFUL IN RIGHT NOW WORKS IT'S JUST NOT A LOT OF TEETH THERE'S NOT A LOT WE CAN DO FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE OTHER THAN RESPOND TO THOSE. DAY TODAY CALLS FOR SERVICE TYPICALLY A QUALITY OF LIFE I CALLS ON WHETHER BE ABOUT MUSIC OR PEOPLE IN CARS OR- DISTURBANCES A PERSPECTIVE THINGS IN AROUND THESE STEPS PHONES. THE THING I'M FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT I THINK IF WE GET IT ABLE TO GET THE RECALL AS AS AS IN THESE ISSUES AND DRIVE OUT THESE PREDATORY OPERATORS NEEDS UNSCRUPULOUS ACTOR. SOME OF THIS CAN THESE ANCILLARY. CONCERNS WILL GO AWAY. CAN I ALSO ASK. THE LICENSING SPECTERS I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN- QUIRKS BUT WORKED ON TRYING TO GET US ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ADDED MORE MONEY FOR MORE INSPECTORS NO ONE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS OUR CODE ENFORCEMENT ARE- SHERIFF'S OFFICERS WE'RE HAVING TO BE AND WITH THAT THE STAFF. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THAT AS WE LEFT OFF WITH THE- LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH AT THAT TIME AS THE CHAIR WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT RIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS IS NOW WE HAVE A NEW. CHAIR I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE OF A PUBLIC THAT'S EDUCATED ON. THE STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE SO I DO THINK WE CAN RE LOOK AT THAT BUT I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR COMPLIANCE OFFICERS IN ESSENCE HEADQUARTERED IN SACRAMENTO FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. DID A GOOD ROUND ABOUT WELL WE PUT ONE IN LOS ANGELES AND I HAVE. QUITE A BIT FOR ME SAYING LOS ANGELES CAN BE AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC UP MAYBE FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT THAT IS NOT BASED IN ORANGE COUNTY SO WE STILL HAVE STEPS TO TAKE. BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT IF WE HAVE EIGHT COMPLIANCE OFFICERS I BELIEVE IT'S TEN NOW AT THE STATE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE SOMEBODY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FIVE DAYS A WEEK IT COULD SIMPLY BE. ONE DAY A WEEK MAYBE AN ORANGE COUNTY SOMEBODY ELSE AND SAN DIEGO BECAUSE CERTAINLY. OTHER COUNTIES ARE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES SO ON NOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE AT THE PARCHMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. IN THE KEY POSITION I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD IN AN ESSENCE. CREATE A PATHWAY THAT IT'S NEW AND VISIONARY. SENATE DEBATE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR. OUR PANELISTS I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS OUT. NEEDING A OF ALL EFFORTS THAT HAVE GONE FORWARD I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF BILLS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN. WE PROBABLY HAD TO CLOSE TO TWELVE THIRTEEN ALL OF WHICH DIED IN COVERED MANY OF THE TOPICS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED. SO I THINK ARE MINE. THOSE OF US WHO SERVE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR HOUSE WE NEVER GIVE UP WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TO. REDUCE THE LEGISLATION THAT RESPONSE TO THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD HERE THEY- ARE TODAY AND BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING COMES MORE MORE PUBLIC. I THINK WE GOT A LOT OF A LOT MORE FORCE BEHIND US SINCE WE- INTRODUCED SITE AND COME UP WITH SOME NEW IDEAS THAT CERTAINLY ARE GENERATED BY DISCUSSIONS SO. THANK YOU AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA IS IN GREAT TO JOIN YOU IN AND CERTAINLY ALL THE PANELISTS IN MAYOR ON FOLEY THANK YOU FOR POSTING FAN. I THINK IT'S A GREAT THE RIGHT DIRECTION CAN REALLY HELP THE SCHOOL. AT ALL LEVELS LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CERTAINLY I IN THE LEGISLATURE. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A VERY BRIEF CLOSING COMMENT THINKING ONLY ALL THE PARTICIPATE TO HAVE JOINED US FROM THE PUBLIC. I MEAN THAT AS YOU INFORMATION WE DO AS WELL. FOR THE LEADERSHIP WITH NOT ONLY ON THE ASSEMBLY SITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KADI PETERS NORRIS AND ON THE SENATE SIDE WITH A SENATOR PAT BATES. I WILL JUST READ. THESE WORDS THAT I COUNT MY TAKE AWAY IS. I'M NEVER IT'S NEVER TOO TOO TOO LATE TO CONTINUE TO LEARN BUT I'M SHOCKED. IT SHAMEFUL AND IT'S STAY GREEN AND WHAT WE SEE THAT IS RELATED TO THE DICTION AND THE STIGMA THAT ARE KEEPING FAMILIES SUFFERING IN SILENCE MANY TIMES ALONE NOT UNDERSTANDING NOW TO NAVIGATE A BROKEN SYSTEM. AND MY BROTHER BILLY STORY IS A STORY OF MANY AND I KNOW THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- ENDLESS HOURS TO SEE SOME RELIEF FOR THE FAMILIES THAT SUFFER AND FOR THE INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK. OUR PANELISTS HERE I THINK. IT IS. IT'S CLEAR TO ME I'M ON SO MANY LEVELS I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INSURE THAT WE HAVE A BETTER PARTNERSHIP AT BETWEEN OUR FEDERAL OFFICIALS LOCAL OFFICIALS STATE OFFICIALS AND COUNTY OFFICIALS TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS AND GET THIS DONE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THAT. I'M NOT BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP THE FINAL PANEL IS TO IS GOING TO PART OF OUR FIRST COMMITTEE IT'S NOW BEEN ABLE TO JOIN US HERE THEY GIVE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN TODAY. SO MANY OF US HAS BEEN. BY ADDICTION. WHETHER WE STRUGGLED SELVES WEATHER WE'VE HAD A LOVED ONE OR A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS STRUGGLED THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT TOUCHES ALL OF OUR LIVES AND- WINDY MCINTYRE IS WHEN I I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEARS WE'VE- BEEN DEVELOPING LEGISLATION WHEN HE IS. AT THE COUNTER AS- FIVE JERRY IT'S LAW AND A PATIENT ADVOCATE AND THAT. SHOWS SHARE HER STORY AND HER PARENTS WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT INDUSTRY AND THEN WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. HI WENDY. THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAD ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS WHERE YOU FEAR I'M GONNA BE LATE BECAUSE NONE OF THE ALARMS GO ON AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. NAME IS WENDY MCINTYRE. I FOUND THE CHAIRS LÀ SHORTLY MY STE JERRY DIED IN A ROW AGREE HAVE IRONICALLY CALLED. THE SAFE HOUSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SHARE MY STORY. AND THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS AND FOR THE LEGISLATIVE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THESE ISSUES. WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THAT NO PARENT WANTS TO GET I WANTED TO STAND BACK. AND STAY THERE. BUT INSTEAD I DECIDED TO BECOME BETTER NOT BETTER. NOW I DEDICATE THE REST OF MY LIFE TO SAVING OTHERS. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE I STAND HERE TODAY THE HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN ROGUE REHABS. I INVESTIGATE THESE THAT'S DALY I'M HORRIFIED AT WHAT DISCOVERED. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN I GOT A CALL FROM ABOUT ANOTHER BOY DONOVAN DOYLE. LIKE MY SON JARED HE DIED IN A ROBBERY HAVE. CARRIE ROBERTS CHAT ERIC JAMES MATH CORY AND I COULD GO ON AND ON. IN A FEW MINUTES YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM JACK LONDON THAT SHOULD THE TWIN SISTER OF HARRIS AND UNFORTUNATELY LOST HIS LIFE ROGUE REHAB RIGHT HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY. IN FACT AFTER HEARING I'M GOING TO ACCOMPANY HER PARENTS TO SANTA ANA SUPERIOR COURT JURY TRIAL WILL BEGIN TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH. THE WEEK DOESN'T GO BY THAT I DON'T GET A CALL FROM HER BROKEN MOM OR DAD. I KEEP COMING TO THE STATE THIS LIST OF DEAD BODIES MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH. AND IT FALLS ON DEAF EARS. TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED YESTERDAY OF OVERDOSES IN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE TODAY. CALIFORNIA STATE REGULATORS HAVE INVESTIGATED MORE THAN A HUNDRED NINETY ONE DEATHS THE TREATMENTS AND CENTERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. THIS NUMBER IS MISLEADING BECAUSE THE DEATHS DO NOT INCLUDE SOBER LIVING HOMES BECAUSE OUR LIVING ROOMS DON'T HAVE TO REPORT THOSE DEATHS. I'M HERE TO GIVE A VOICE TO THE VICTIMS SURVIVORS AND FIGHTERS WE CHALLENGE THIS BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT PLACES PROFIT OF. THIS SECTION AND THE FEAR OF BEING JUDGED WILL OFTEN HAVE FAMILIES WAITING TO THE LAST MINUTE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP. THEY OFTEN FEEL TERRIFIED ALONE AND DESPERATE TO FIND HELP FOR THE LOVED ONES. SOME PROVIDERS FIRST IT WILL STRATEGICALLY. HONEST FEAR TO GET A YOUNG PERSON AND THEIR SO CALLED TREATMENT PROGRAM. WITHOUT ACTUALLY PROVE VITAL MUCH IN THE WAY OF CARE. FOR MANY FAMILIES THIS PREDATORY BEHAVIOR WILL APPEAR AS A GIFT. A KIND AND COMPASSIONATE STRANGER WHO CAN ANSWER THEIR PRAYERS. UNTIL THE DAY THEIR CHILD HAS RETURNED HOME IN A BODY BAG. SHARES LÀ IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET SOBER AND US. HEALTHY AND SAFE WAY. THERE MUST BE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE. JERRY IS A LOT IT'S ABOUT TAKING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE NATION AND WE MUST DO BETTER. FOR PATIENTS AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT CONSIDER PEOPLE AND TREATMENT PATIENTS THEY THINK THEIR CLIENTS. ON VACATION. AND THESE DETOX FACILITIES WHERE MEDICINE IS BEING PRACTICE THERE. IS CONSIDERED A NON MEDICAL FACILITY SOME GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME NEW LEADERSHIP AS THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS CHANGE. AS A SAFER STARS WE NEED TO STARTED KNOWLEDGE AND THESE ARE PATIENTS SEEKING RECOVERY NOT INCIDENT CATION A DETOX HOUSE WERE LEVEL MEDICATIONS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED BY UP AND STAFF. IS CURRENTLY LIKE I SAY CONSIDERED A NON MEDICAL KHILADI. IT'S A HIGH WIRE ACT. OF ADMINISTER UP TO SIXTEEN MEDICATIONS TO GROWING PRAGMATIC TO CAME TO THE SPECIFIC T. ONLY TO GET ON ONE DRUG. I'M HERE TODAY IS GEARED SMALL AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER ACTIVISTS MOTHER FATHER SEEKING CHANGE. OF CHANGE WON'T HELP BRING. HER CHILDREN BACK. IT WILL CREATE A LEGACY FOR FUTURE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO RECEIVE SET FOR TRADE. COUNTRY IN FACILITIES LIKE SOBER LIVING HOMES NEED TOUGHER STANDARDS BETTER SCREEN AND MORE OVERSIGHT. REGULATORY GAPS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE QUALITY OF SOBRE LOOKING ON DISABILITIES AND REHABS AND TYPE OF QUALITY OF SERVICES THEY PROVIDE AND THE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND WHICH THEY OPERATE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CHAIRMAN PETRIE-NORRIS AND HER BIPARTISAN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WORKING GROUP FUTURE LEGISLATION TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO FOLLOW CONCERNS PUT FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'D NOW LIKE TO INTRODUCE CHAPLAIN. YEAH HI MY NAME IS JACQUELINE DINNER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING UP HERE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT MY- TWIN BROTHER. HIS NAME IS HARRISON HE DIED AT A REHAB CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN HE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND I WAS DUE TO INSURANCE FRAUD BODY BROKERING A MISDIAGNOSIS PURPOSELY TO INCREASE INSURANCE CLAIMS AND PROCESS LIKE YOU TOUCHED ON MY PARENTS ARE. RIGHT NOW IN THE TRIAL AGAINST THE NURSE PRACTITIONER WHO INCORRECTLY IN PURPOSELY DIAGNOSE HARRISON AS I HEAR AN ADDICT. AND THEY GAVE HIM A DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUGS. WITH FETAL WARNINGS THAT SHE WAS NOT ADMINISTERED TO GIVE AND THEN LEFT HIM ALONE WITH NO SUPERVISION TO DIE. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO COME UP HERE TO. YOU KNOW. ASK IF WE CAN LIKE WE TOUCHED ON AND BARRY BROKERING BUT ALSO INCREASE STAFFING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO ALLOW FOR PROPER OVERSIGHT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ONLY SIXTEEN STAFF MEMBERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OVERSEEING FOUR THOUSAND. AND MORE A REHAB FACILITY IS AN ORANGE COUNTY. IN CALIFORNIA- AND SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON IT IS INCREASING AMERICA MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CAP- TO HOLD MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS MORE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. EVEN IF THERE IS THE DEATH OF ALL THEY CAN ONLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THANK YOU. AND WHEN I THINK BOTH OF YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND. AND FOR BEING WILLING TO SHARE YOUR STORY AND WHEN THE ISSUE. IS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING FOR SO MANY YEARS TO TURN YOUR GRIEF INTO ACTION IN AN INTERACTION FOR SAVING. SAVING OTHER CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU AND I THINK AS I SAID TO YOU BEFORE IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE ESTABLISH. GAME PROTECTIONS FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WE HAVE FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING ANY OTHER KIND OF MEDICAL TREATMENT NOTS THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU AND AT WITH THAT. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP TO YOU TO PUBLIC COMMENT I IF YOU CAN JUST FROM A LINE AT THAT PODIUM AND JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF EVERYONE CAN CAN LIMIT. COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE. JUST TO HAVE EVERYONE CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK. MY NAME IS LAURIE DURANT AND ADVOCATES FOR RESPONSIBLE TREATMENT I WANT TO THANK THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND OUR COMMENTS ARE REALLY DIRECTED TO THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE THAT ISN'T HERE TODAY.

AND IT IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. HI MY NAME'S MERRY ORDER AND MY SOBRIETY DATE IS AUGUST FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I GOT SOBER IN HAWAII IN THAT YEAR AND THEY HAD FULL SERVICES YOU COULD GO TO COUNSELING YOU COULD HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. YOU COULD SEE PSYCHIATRISTS. YOU COULD HAVE MEDICAL HELP EVERYBODY IN HAWAII EITHER HAD HEALTH INSURANCE OR THEY WERE COVERED BY THE STATE SO I WANT YOU TO THINK. FOR YOU START CLOSING. PLACES THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE IN SERVICES NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION PROBLEMS. SAM THAT'S MY SCHOOL. THANK YOU. HI AM SRI DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM DICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS AND I REPRESENT THE COUNSELORS THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN THE SEVERAL LIVINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM GOOD APPLES AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS BEING VERY HUMBLE ABOUT HER NEW ROLE AT THE STATE CAPITOL SHE CAME IN AS A FRESHMAN FEET BARELY WET SAYS STARTED THE FIRST AS HE CARCASS OUR STATE HAS EVER HAD. SHE CALLED EVERY TREATMENT PROVIDER ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS TREATMENT AND CLIENTS. INTO HER SHE AT OFFICE REFRESHMENT BUT. STILL SMALL. SOUNDS ALL DOWN IN OUR OFFICE ON THE COUCH AND SAID HOW DO I FIX THIS SHE DIDN'T SAYS ROBINSON SAY YOU'RE AWFUL PEOPLE YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE SHE SAID YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS YOU TELL ME HOW TO MAKE THESE THINGS STOP. AND THEN SHE WON'T ONE STEP FURTHER SHE CO AUTHORED THE BILL TO MAKE OUTPATIENT SERVICES MANDATORY LICENSURE. AND THEN WHEN THAT BILL GOT IN TROUBLE WITH SOME POLITICAL SHENANIGANS SHE ACTUALLY TOOK OVER THAT BILL PUT IN ONE OF HER OWN BILLS SAT AT THE STATE CAPITOL ON THE LAST NIGHT. AND GOT THAT BILL TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK HE'S RETURNED IT WAS SOME SUGGESTIONS OR WE'RE GOING TO GET IT THROUGH THE YEAR BUT WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT HER. I'M TELLING YOU SHE JUMPED IN AND SAID. AND MYSELF. IN ADDITION TO THAT SHE ALSO GOT PASSED AND SIGNED. EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN WHICH DOES EXACTLY WHAT YOUR LOCAL. OF LOOK LEGISLATORS ARE ASKING FOR. BRING HERE WITH THE TICKET HAVE A TICKET BACK. FOR A YEAR IF YOU'RE GOING TO OFFER HOUSING WHICH IS NOT ILLEGITIMATE WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGITIMATE PROVIDERS AS A CONTINUUM OF CARE YOU CAN'T KEEP PEOPLE IN TREATMENT FOREVER THEY GET ON WITH THIRTY DAYS THEY'RE LIVING BERMAN ISN'T CONDUCIVE TO RECOVERY. THEY GET A SOBER LIVING THAT MIGHT BE OWNED BY THE SAME TREATMENT PROGRAM. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT BE TRANSPARENT EXPLAINED TO THE TO THE CLIENTS OR PATIENTS. WHAT THEY'RE GETTING SO THAT BILL ALSO DOES THAT IT'S FABULOUS. WE'VE GOT TONS OF THINGS TO WORK ON. THE LAST THING I WANNA LOVE YOU LEAVE YOU WITH IS CURBING YOU KNOW WHO DOES MOST OF THE CURBING YOUR INSURANCE COMPANIES I REPRESENT THE LEGITIMATE PROVIDERS WHEN A DOCTOR- WORDS OUR DOCTOR HERE. WITH THEIR- SAYS YOU NEED YOUR MEDICAL NECESSITY IS THIRTY DAYS THAT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME I'M YOUR HEAD IS NOT EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN USING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S NEGLECTED ITS TREATMENT SYSTEM. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TREATMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU'RE BARELY THINKING WALKING. AND BEING ABLE TO START YOUR RECOVERY AT THIRTY DAYS SO WHEN AN INCH WHEN IT WHEN A PHYSICIAN SAYS YOU GET THIRTY DAYS. AND SIX DAYS LATER. AND WITH A CALL FROM THAT ENSURE SAYING YOU'LL NO LONGER MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY. WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT PERSON THESE ARE EVIL TREATMENT PROVIDERS THROWING PEOPLE ON THE STREETS ALTHOUGH. THERE ARE THE BAD APPLES AND WE'RE WORKING HARD TO GET RID OF THEM. BUT IT'S ALSO THE GOOD APPLES IN IS BECAUSE INSURANCE DOESN'T WANT TO PAY FOR THIS BECAUSE IT BECAME A MANDATORY BENEFIT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEY WENT WOW THAT'S EXPENSIVE. HERE'S HOW WE GET RID OF IT WE DENY PEOPLE. WE MAKE THEM STEP DOWN TO TREATMENT THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR NEEDS. AND WE OBJECT THEM FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY SO THAT'S- A HUGE UP WE'VE GOT TO. GO AFTER NEW JERSEY NEW YORK PENNSYLVANIA IF THE DOCTOR SEARCH THIRTY DAYS YOU GET THIRTY DAYS. INSURE DOESN'T. COME BACK AND SAY. YOU'RE DONE OUT ON THE STREETS. SO I AM. I'VE BEEN LOBBYING FOR THIS INDUSTRY FOR HONEST HONORABLE THIRTY YEARS AND THIS IS JUST A NEW DAY SACRAMENTO AND PRIMARILY BECAUSE- OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SO THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MONICA RICHARDSON I'M A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER AND ACTIVIST AND THE VICTIM'S ADVOCATE. I HAVE MANY MOTHERS HAVE CONTACTED ME WITH THE CHILDREN. OF THE RE HAVE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE REGULATED AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THIS. WHY IS AN UNREGULATED ANONYMOUS SOCIETY FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE COMMON FOUNDATION IN OUR TREATMENT INDUSTRY TODAY. IF MY BREAST CANCER THAT I HAD WAS TREATED LIKE IT WAS IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE I COULD BE DEAD. WE HAVE LOTS OF NEW INNOVATIONS TO SCIENCE I WANT TO MAKE A PLUG FOR SMART RECOVERY SELF MANAGEMENT AND RECOVERY TRAINING IS AROUND TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT OFFERS FACE TO FACE MEETINGS. THEY HAVE TRAINED LEADERS. NOBODY LABELS THEMSELVES AN ALCOHOLIC OR AN ADDICT ANYMORE IT'S KIND OF PRETTY OLD. WHY IS IT EASIER OR LET'S SAY IT'S HARDER TO OPEN A NAIL SALON. THAT A RIO OKAY IF YOU'RE OF THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BACKGROUND CHECK BUT IF I'M GOING TO HELP. SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALCOHOL OR PROBLEMATIC DRUG USE THAT I CAN BE ANYBODY I CAN BE AN ECSTATIC DURING EXTREME CURRENT ALMOND ON I KNOW NO ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT REALLY THE CASE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT CARLOS RODON WHO WAS MURDERED BY A COURT ORDERED VIOLENT OFFENDER IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IN A REVIEW OF IN SAP. BECAUSE IT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR COLLARD TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR WITH FOUR OTHER WITH THE ROOM THIS IS A HOUSE THAT WAS FOURTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET THERE WERE TWENTY PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WHY IS BLUE CROSS PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR CARLY BE TO BE DRIVEN TO THAN A SOBER LIVING. IN SANTA CLARITA WHERE IT THERE IS DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND ALL THE MEN WORST THEY'RE BEING DRIVEN TO IN THAT A MEETING WERE DIVERTED FROM GOING TO JAIL. AT HIS A VIOLENT OFFENDER WHO WAS COURT ORDERED J. FIFTY FIVE TIMES OVER TWENTY YEARS SHE WAS DEAD WITHIN FOUR MONTHS. YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T HELP HIM. THERE ARE WAYS PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER WAY IS THE SCIENCE MEDICATION CO OCCURRING TRAUMA IT'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TODAY AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST SAY SOMETHING THAT I NOTICE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON VAPING ADDS. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED FROM VAPING. HARRISON TO WE'RE NOT EVEN THE NUMBERS THAT WHEN DO YOU STE YOU KNOW GIVES NUMBERS FOR ARE NOT EVEN FOR ALCOHOL RELATED DEATHS WERE DEALING WITH OPIOID SHE WAS WHICH IS DOUBLE THAT NUMBER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING. FROM WITHDRAWALS LIKE THERE IS A RE BUT I HOPE IT'S CLOSE NOW SPANISH SPEAKING WHEN IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AT A DETECTIVE TOLD ME ABOUT DOWNTOWN WHERE THEY WERE TIENE PEOPLE UP IN AMERICA IN LOS ANGELES IN A CHAIR SO THEY COULD GO WITH THROUGH WITHDRAWALS FROM ALCOHOL WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION. WHICH IS REALLY DANGEROUS IT'S. IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS. HEART ATTACK SEIZURE. MY RESEARCH THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING THAT LOOKS LIKE WHERE I WENT. AT CEDARS FOR MY BREAST CANCER. IT'S A REAL CLINIC IN A REAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE SO OPPOSED THAT YOU COULD WE COULD GET INTO THE REAL INTO THE CENTURY. AND PUT. EIGHT HOME. A RESIDENTIAL HOME AND HOW THE REAL CLINICS THAT'S WHAT THEY DID IN FLORIDA YOU CAN GO TO FLORIDA AND ACTUALLY GO TO A REAL DETOX THREE TO FIVE THERE'S GONNA BE DOCTORS THE NURSES THERE ALL DAY LONG. THANK YOU. YOU. THE NOON THANK YOU I'M BARBARA THEY'LL GLAZE AND I SERVE ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND THINGS IN BEACH- I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU PUT THIS ON TODAY IT'S TIMELY AS MATTER OF FACT IT'S REALLY OVERDUE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ONE OF THE THREADS THAT REALLY CAME THROUGH TO ME. PLEASE FOLLOW. THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU HAVE OUT THERE I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE THE FULL RIGHT TO FLORIDA. ON THE CONSULTATION A CALIFORNIA CITIES HAD DAVID HAMBURG OUT HERE TWO SUMMERS AGO. AND IT WAS WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR PENNINGTON BEACH AND THE PART I'M SAYING THAT IS BECAUSE- HE GAVE US. HE GAVE US STEPS ON WHAT TO DO BECAUSE OF FLORIDA WAS AHEAD OF WITH ALL THIS CRAZINESS. AND THE. LEFT FLORIDA AND CAME HERE THE- LAST WEEK OR SO. AND THE PEOPLE ONE OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW IN THIS ROOM NANCY CLARK OF NO NANCY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS NEVER BY EVER HEARD HER SAY. OH MY GOD I'VE GOT PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND LIKE MANIACS PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT. THEY NEED SHE CARES. SURE THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE OF. BILLS I'VE MET SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT. HAS I HAVE STAYED THERE. THANKS NANCY FOR SAVING THEIR LIVES. SO I THINK YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE- JUST FOLLOW UP ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO MINNESOTA. THEN DO THAT- THE ORANGE COUNTY THE AGENCY IS WORKING ON REMOVING THE STATE. YOU KNOW I WILL BE VAN ON SATURDAY I MEAN. IF THIS HAD A COMPOUND FRACTURE IN THEIR LEG IT WOULDN'T BE A BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU TELL THEM THEY'RE SCHIZOPHRENIC. THEY CAN'T GET SERVICES THIS IS RIDICULOUS SO- I ALSO WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE A LOT I KNOW GOING ON AND I KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST TO. TRY AND GET THESE THROUGH BUT- ORANGE COUNTY NOW LEADS THE EIGHT. DOES END TEENAGE SUICIDE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING AND I APPLAUD YOU AND MISS BATES IN THIS QUICK SILVA I KNOW YOU'VE GONE UP THERE AND I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS AND THEY'VE BEEN TURNED OUT WHY ARE THEY BEING TURNED DOWN IS IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION OR THE PEOPLE STILL IN THE DARK AGES ABOUT HOW HOW THINGS NEED TO BE THIS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE REGULATED IT NEEDS TO BE CERTIFIED IT NEEDS TO BE LICENSE. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. LET'S GET RID OF NOT RATED BUT LET'S- BUT THE INSURANCE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ONE REAL PEOPLE. AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY WE WANT QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SO. I THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND PLEASE REACH OUT TO US. IF WE CAN HELP YOU WE GOT TO GO TO SACRAMENTO I WENT WITH SHARON QUIRK SILVA WHEN SHE HAD. A BEES FIVE SEVENTY NINE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS BUT- YOU KNOW I'M SAYING WE NEED WE JUST NEED MORE REGULATION OVERSIGHT. COUNTY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN BERRIDGE AND I'M WITH CONGRESSMAN HARDLY RIDGES DISTRICT OFFICE AND THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HEARING AND AGREE THAT WE NEED BETTER COORDINATION AND PARTNERSHIP AMONG ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT CITY STATE FEDERAL- AND- FOR EXAMPLE SAM'S A WHICH IS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. JUST UNVEILED ITS BEST PRACTICES AND SUGGESTED GUIDELINES FOR THE OPERATION OF SOBER LIVING HOMES AS DIRECTED BY CONGRESS AND THE SUPPORT ACT AND ALONG WITH A BIPARTISAN COALITION OF MEMBER CONGRESSMAN RITA ENGAGED SANSA DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE GUIDELINES. AM AS WE WORK TO REVIEW THESE GUIDELINES AGAIN JUST ENCOURAGING THE REACHING OUT AND CONNECTING- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ALL COURT NEEDED AS WELL AS PART BIPARTISAN BILL HR THIRTY. EIGHTY NINE. SENATE BUT IF ENACTED THE BILL WOULD HELP THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST ADDICTION CRISIS- SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND LET'S ALL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. Q. AND ABSOLUTE PLEASE. CONGRESSMAN READ AS I HAVE WORK ON DECEMBER THE GUIDELINES AND HR THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU FOR COMING ASSEMBLY WOMAN. CONNIE PETRIE-NORRIS IT'S KIND OF A MAYBE PROVIDENTIAL THAT YOU'VE COME TO COSTA MESA. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MAYOR FOLEY THANK YOU WENDY AND THINK YOU'RE ALSO ARE WONDERFUL NANCY CLARK WHO. YEARS AGO LIVE VERY CLOSE TO NANCY CLARK'S. SOBER LIVING HOMES AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT BECAUSE THEY WERE INVISIBLE AND SO- I GUESS SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM FROM COSTA MESA CAN SAY WE SURVIVED FIFTEEN YEARS OF THE INVASION- BY SOBER LIVING HOMES INTO. COSTA MESA TO WRECK HAVOC BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOME OF THESE THINGS WERE TOUCHED ON ACTUALLY- MY THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD SON IS SIX MONTHS OVER. FROM A HEROIN ADDICTION. AND THANKFULLY HE- I BELIEVE GOD LET HIM INTO A GOOD TREATMENT CENTER THAT IS FROM TUSTIN BUT IN FIND. HELP BECAUSE I HAVE LEVERAGE AND I SAID BASICALLY- IF I IF I MAKE YOUR CAR PAYMENT WOULD YOU GO WERE YOU GOING TO DO PARKS THE RECOVERY AND- THAT WAS WHY HE COOPERATED BUT HE WAS OUT AT THE BOTTOM. HE HAD REACHED AT THE BOTTOM AND SO HAD AYE. AND SO- BUT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE IS IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GOING TO DETOX TODAY. THERE ARE NOT DIG PARTS PLACES FOR PEOPLE WHO POOR WITHOUT INSURANCE. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH IN IN A LOT OF THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DECIDE LIKE SOMEBODY'S LIVING DOWN OF THE JUNGLE AT THE END OF NINETEEN STREET YEAH I'M READY BUT I NEED TO SAFELY BT DETOX. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PLACES THANKFULLY MY SON HAD JUST GONE ON MEDI CAL AND THIS PLACE WHERE HE WENT ALLOWED HIM TO WHERE HE DETOX AND THEN HE WENT INTO. LIKE A THREE OR FOUR MONTHS PROGRAM AND EVERY DAY- I'M THANKFUL AND I KNOW HE IS TO AND HE'S YOU KNOW WORKING HAS RECOVERY BUT THAT DETOX. ELEMENT IS MISSING- THE OTHER THING IS I DISCOVERED. ALL THESE OTHER STATE PEOPLE THE COMMON THEY GET ON CALIFORNIA MEDI CAL AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THEM TO GET RECOVERY IN COSTA MESA IN CALIFORNIA THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF RECIPROCATION WHERE WE BILL THAT STATE THAT THEY COME FROM. IN ORDER TO ROUTE TO SAY ALL RIGHT YOU GET TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING WE'RE GOING HOME BUT WE ARE FINE WE ARE. PUTTING THESE PEOPLE IN REHAB AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT WHEN THEY'RE NOT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THE OTHER THING IS KIND OF A FEDERAL ISSUE WITH AND I'M THAT OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM- CONGRESSMAN ROUTE IS OFFICES HERE. IS HOMES AT SAY THEIR HOMES THE IDEA WAS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE GOOD COMMUNITY NEIGHBORHOOD PICK UP TRASH SAID YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THEY'RE KIND OF. ISOLATED BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA. THERE THAT'S A CASH BUSINESS IS THE IRIS REGULATING THEM DO THAT DO THEY- THE MONEY'S JUST LIKE UNDER THE TABLE BUT THEY'RE COLLECTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE MANY HER CURVES SO MANY THEY START ALL OVER- LAST THING I WANT TO SAY BECAUSE THE RESTART ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND OVERSIGHT I WORK AT COLLEGE HOSPITAL. AND I WORK IN THE ADOLESCENT UNIT AND THOSE ARE THE KIDS THAT- WANNA TAKE THEIR LIVES MANY OF THEM ARE ON DRUGS. SO WE HAVE TO LOOK THIS UP THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE- WITH DUAL DIAGNOSIS WITH SUICIDE IDEATION BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO AS A- WE HAVE TO AS A COUNTRY REALIZE THAT OUR KIDS NEED TO BE YOU KNOW AN ARTICULATED DID NOT TO TAKE DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THE KIDS LIKE THEY SAID THE OTHER DAY UPSTREAM. THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE REALLY ADDICTS BY THE TIME YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THE CAUSE AND FIND OUT WHO. SELLS ALL THE DRIVE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S GENE CAMPBELL- A RESIDENT HERE IN COSTA MESA I'M ALSO A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER. AND NEXT MONTH ALL OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF SOBRIETY SO I COME AT THIS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE- THE EQUATION- COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS I WOULD MAKE BASED ON OVER TWENTY YEARS OF WORK IN THE RECOVERY INDUSTRY AND I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR I'M NOT AFFILIATED WITH. ANY TREATMENT CENTER I'M INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER- I AM WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN FAVOR OF REGULATING SOBER LIVINGS ESPECIALLY. AN OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS AS A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER I'M REQUIRED TO DO A LIVE SCAM. WHICH MEANS ON FINGERPRINTED. THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY LICENSE CLINICIAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF IT WERE UP TO ME THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR ANYONE WORKING AT ANY LEVEL OF CARE IN ANY KIND OF ADDICTION RECOVERY TREATMENT. OR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND JUST TO PUT ON YOUR RADAR MENTAL HEALTH IS THE NEWER ACTION BECAUSE INSURANCE WILL REIMBURSE IT. IS THAT THEY USE TO REIMBURSE ADDICTION SO. PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND MOVING FORWARD THAT THOSE BAD. ACTORS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. START MOVING OVER AND HAVE ALREADY STARTED MOVING OVER INTO. HEALTH ISSUE. A IN TREATMENTS- AND THOSE FOLKS ARE INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE AS WELL- A LOT OF TIME. PLACES GET LICENSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE JOINT COMMISSION. THE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CHARTS BEING LOCKED BEHIND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF. DRAWERS THAN THEY ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT DIRECT PATIENT CARE. AND SO THOSE STANDARDS NEED TO BE REEVALUATED I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST TO SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH FAMILIES. I CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENT CENTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT HAVE A GOOD FAMILY PROGRAM. AND IT'S AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION THE FAMILIES NEED TO BE EDUCATED THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS. EMIGRATE BLESSED. ARE SUFFERING AS MUCH AS THE ADDICTS AND ALCOHOLICS OR- SO I WOULD REQUIRE THAT THERE BE ADEQUATE FAMILY SERVICE. INVOLVED IN ANY TREATMENT CENTER. THE OTHER THING IS WITH DOING ALL DUE RESPECT TO DOCTOR IS. OUT ACTORS THE LICENSE OF PATIENTS. WHO ARE OVER PRESCRIBED. IT'S. ONE OF THEM IT. RIGHT OR BENZODIAZEPINES LIKE EXAM X. LIKE OUT OF THEM LIKE VALIUM THAT IS A HUGE SILENT EPIDEMIC THAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP. THE LAST THING I WANT TO JUST MENTION IS UP I ALSO PUT ON YOUR RADAR THAT'S KIND OF SEPARATE BUT- EQUIVALENT TO ME. ONE IS NOW LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S PULLING PEOPLE OVER FOR DO YOU WISE AND HOW THEY'RE BEING TESTED. BECAUSE THERE'S NO. STING GOING ON IN THAT RESPECT AND WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE ROADS EVERY DAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. I AM I THINK. THIS ISN'T SURE. ORANGE COUNTY IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT TESTING FOR AN FOR MARIJUANA ORANGE COUNTY'S ACTUALLY LEADING THE STATE IN TERMS OF DOING THAT TESTING DOING THAT ANALYSIS AND TRYING TO ESTABLISH. THRESHOLDS THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS ACTUALLY DOING DOING SOME REALLY GOOD WORK THERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PERRY FISHER I AM ONE OF THE VERY FRUSTRATED HOMEOWNERS LIVING ADJACENT TO FOR SOBER LIVING HOMES I TOTALLY GET COSTA MESA HAUSER ORDINANCE THESE FOR SOBER LIVING HOMES. COUNTY MY PROPERTY AND IT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THREE HUNDRED FEET OF MY HOUSE MAINLY BECAUSE I LIVE IN A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD. AS LONG AS THE RECOVERY HOMES OPERATE AT SIX RESIDENTS THEY ARE REQUIRED I UNDERSTAND BY FEDERAL LAW TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO THERE'S REALLY I MEAN I HEAR A LOT REGULATION LICENSING OVERSIGHT DO THIS DO THAT ENFORCEMENT. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET AROUND THE FITS AND THEIR REQUIREMENT FIFTIES HOMES HAVE TO BE TREATED JUST LIKE MY HOME LIKE MY NEIGHBOR A COUPLE WITH FOUR CHILDREN. THERE ARE SIX. IT'S THE SAME THE ONLY. RECOURSE PEOPLE IN MY SITUATION HAVE. IS THE CITY'S NUISANCE LAW. AND I'VE BEEN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS SINCE COSTA MESA MAYOR FOLEY CAN TELL YOU SINCE WE STARTED DOWN THE ROAD WITH OUR OUR ONE ORDINANCE LIKE BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. I'M STILL LIVING IN THE SAME CONDITIONS I STILL WALK IN MY HOUSE. BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THE POOL NEXT DOOR TO ME AND MY HOUSE SMELLS LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH TRAY NOW LOOK BAD IN THE VP LET'S ADD IN I VERY SELDOM LET MY THREE YEAR OLD GRANDSON GO IN THE BACKYARD BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE. WHERE'S WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME WHO'S PROTECTING THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO TOLERATE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY BASICALLY NOTHING ANYBODY CAN DO YOU JUST GO RENT A HOUSE. YOU BRING IN FIVE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER IN THEIR SOBRIETY AND THERE'S THEIR UNTOUCHABLE. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF US ESPECIALLY IN COSTA MESA IN THE SINGLE FAMILY AREAS. AND WE ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY MULTIPLE CELL. ANYTHING YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WORK WITH THE FED SINCE THERE ARE LAWS AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS HOW EVER ANYTHING YOU COULD DO TO TAKE THE BURDEN OFF. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. ON A BRIEF THE RES BRIEFLY RESPOND TO THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR- YEP I APPRECIATE. WHAT A FRUSTRATING SITUATION NOT AS SO HERE'S MY CENTRAL BELIEF MY CENTRAL BELIEF IS THAT MOST OF THOSE AND YOU KNOW MOST OF THE SOBER LIVING HOMES THAT ARE. NOT JUST THEY'RE EXPLOITING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THEY ARE ALSO EXPLOITING PATIENTS- NETWORKS AS THEY WERE LIVING HOMES ARE NOT BEING RUN BY COULD OPERATORS YOU'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE. HE SAID NANCY CLARK STABILITY IS RIGHT MY BACKYARD DIDN'T EVEN NOW. GOOD OPERATORS GOOD ACTORS PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY HELPING PEOPLE GET BACK ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. ALSO GOOD NEIGHBOR WHICH IS WHY FOR ME MY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON A DRESS SEEN THAT THE THINGS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IN STATE LAW BECAUSE YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT WE- IF WE WANTED TO BAN ALL ALSO RELIVING HOMES. WE CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL I REALIZE THAT YOU MENTIONED MY BELIEF IS THAT IF WE GET AT THE ROOT CAUSE IN WE AT. S. T. TO SET WE GET RID OF THE PROFIT MOTIVE THAT IS DRIVING SO MANY OF THESE OPERATORS THE THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SICK YOUR COMMUNITY WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THAT IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON. SO THANK YOU VERY FISHER THAT'S WHO JUST SPOKE BECAUSE SHE HAS REALLY DONE OUR HOMEWORK FOR THE COMMUNITY OF COSTS MISSUS SHE'S BEEN ON THE COMPUTER DOING RESEARCH AND IS NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK UP AND I'M GLAD SHE'S HERE TODAY SO I'D ALSO AYE EGGS SO APPLY THE HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU OF PUT THIS TOGETHER I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE WORD THAT HAS COME OUT OF ALMOST EVERY SPEAKERS MOUNT I ESPECIALLY GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T JUST YOU KNOW THAT. STEP UP AND TRY TO HELP OTHER FAMILIES I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO TERRY'S COURSE OF THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER FOR HER FABULOUS COVERAGE OF THIS EPIDEMIC IN IN ORANGE HOW IT'S AFFECTED. US AND EACH GET A SURPRISE FOR. BECAUSE WE'RE BRAIN. I'M SORRY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MORE LIBERAL THAN THE FEDERAL LAW THAT WAS MENTIONED HERE TODAY WHY DON'T WE JUST IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT FURTHER ADO MAKERS STATE LAW LIKE THE FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD PUT A CURB ON QUITE A BIT OF THIS SECOND OF ALL OUR- THIRD. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS POLITICS. THERE IS I YES THE YOUNG LADY WHO CAME AND SPOKE EVERYBODY'S YOUNGER THAN ME SO SHE- ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE RUNNING A HOME AND EVERYTHING SO I JUST RAN OUT NOW SIR. YOU HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE NOW I FEEL THAT HER. HEART IS IN THE BEST PLACE BUT IT IS ASTOUNDING TO ME IN ORANGE COUNTY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE RUNNING SEVERAL LIVE IT DOES IS AND THEY'RE ONLY QUALIFICATION IS. THAT THEY HAVE REAL ESTATE LICENSES THEY HAVE NO MEDICAL BACKGROUND NONE WHATSOEVER. I HOPE EVERYONE'S AWARE THAT IN BEVERLY HILLS AND OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THEY RUN REAL ESTATE SEMINARS. PUMP TO ORANGE COUNTY AND OPEN UP A SOBER LIVING HOME AND THAT- THE MOTHER LODE IS IN PARTICULAR COSTA MESA AND THE REAL MOTHER LOAD YOU KNOW THE GOLD STREAK IS EASE SITE COSTA MESA. TEACHING REALISTIC CLASSES LIKE THIS. I THINK THE LOBBYIST YOU THE- NO ONE'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE LOBBYIST IN SACRAMENTO HERE'S TO LOBBIES TO KEEP THESE PLACES ROCKING AND ROLLING. THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY HOW MANY HOUSES TO THEIR OWN. IN ORANGE COUNTY YOU MIGHT LOOK INTO THAT WE HAVE THE SCOTT BOB WHO IS THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ORANGE COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY LOBBYIST FOR THE SOBER LIVING COMMUNITY AND I THINK IT WAS ALLEN AGAIN I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH- OF PHARMACY. THIS IS THE HE IS THE LOBBYIST FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SELLING THE OPIOIDS. DOESN'T BOTHER ANYBODY THEN WE HAVE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON CITY COUNCILS THAT ACTUALLY OWN THESE HOUSES PEOPLE THAT ARE HEADS OF CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT OWN THESE HOUSES. WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LOOKING INTO THIS WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE LOBBY IS INVOLVED IN ALL- NOT TO MENTION THE REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY. LOBBYIST YOU KNOW HOW STRONG THEIR LOBBY IS IN SACRAMENTO DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS NOT ONLY DO THEY- OWN THE HOUSES. THEY MARKET TO OVERSEAS THEY MARKET TO CHINA INDIA. ENGLAND ANYWAY I CALLED UP VILLA REAL ESTATE TO FIND OUT WHO THE MARKET TO. AND THEN THEY EXPLAINED TO ME HOW THIS WORKS. THE FOREIGNERS BY THE HOMES IT'S JUST AN INVESTMENT THEY DON'T EVEN LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY. THEY MAKE SO MUCH MONEY DOING THIS THEY HAVE A. A COMPANY A MANAGEMENT COMPANY PRINCES IN COSTA MESA IT'S- IT'S HIM CAR AND HE MANAGES THESE HOUSES. AND THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF. THE PEOPLE MOVE OUT WHEN YOU GET ONE OF THESE HOUSES IN YOUR COMMUNITY WE LOST THREE REALLY GOOD NEIGHBORS BECAUSE KEITH RANDALL. PUT A SERVER LIVING FACILITY AT THE END OF THE BLOCK. AND THEY DID THEY HAVE SMALL CHILDREN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY MOVED THREE LONG TIME REALLY GOOD NEIGHBORS. I FEEL THAT THERE'S- THAT THIS. IS THE ANSWER THE STATE SHOULD REGULATE THE WAY THE FED LÀ CHANGE THE STATE LAW SO IT'S LIKE THE FEDS START FIGHTING THE LOBBYIST WHY DON'T WE HAVE A LOBBY WANTED TO RESIDENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY WHERE IS OUR LOBBY LET'S GET TOGETHER TO GET UP THERE. THANK YOU CUTTING PETRIE-NORRIS BECAUSE WE ARE FULLY RIVER. NO BECAUSE THEY'RE LISTENING TO THE CONSTITUENTS THEY'RE NOT TO IGNORING US THERE'S TROUBLE. OUT HERE PLEASE US THANK YOU THANK YOU.

SO I THANK YOU FOR GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK EVERYBODY WHO IS HERE. PLEASE KEEP US IN MIND OUR OFFICE IN MY TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO HELP YOU- WE- WITH THAT INPUT FOR LEGISLATION FROM ORANGE COUNTY. OR ANY ANY OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE COUNTY WOULD OPERATE THAT MUCH. YEAH. THANK YOU AGAIN EVERYONE FOR JOINING US TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC I DEFINITELY I. TAKE A SINGLE HOMEWORK. I WILL JUST BEFORE WE GO ALL YES I THE QUESTION OF NINE TWENTY WHICH A COUPLE OF FOLKS HAVE MENTIONED IT WAS A BILL THAT I AUTHORED. THAT WOULD HAD ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENT FOR ALL OUTPATIENT DRUG REHAB FACILITIES. IN CALIFORNIA. TO BE LICENSED AND WE GOT THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT. BILL WAS VETOED THAT BILL WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR NEW SAM IN HIS VETO MESSAGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. HIS STAFF HE HAS AFFIRMED HIS BELIEF AND HIS COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT ALL SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND PRACTITIONERS ARE LICENSED IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA HIS RATIONALE FOR THE VIDEO IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IT'S WE'RE IN A BIT OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH A VACUUM IN WHAT EXISTS TODAY IN ORDER FOR US TO ESTABLISH A LICENSURE OSKI MAN. HIS RECOMMENDATION REQUEST IS THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE DETAIL SAID THAT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE THIS IS HAS MUCH MORE DETAIL MUCH MORE DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT LICENSE YOUR WILL CONSIST OF. AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN AND TO GET THEM THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING IT WAS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN NINE. IS THAT AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING AND ABOUT MINNESOTA NOW THERE'S SOME BEST PRACTICES IN MINNESOTA I HAD A LOT OF WHAT EXIT IN MINNESOTA IS CODIFIED IN STATE LAW IT IS NOT LEFT UP TO INTERPRETATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO. I AM ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO SEE THIS AS KIND OF YOU KNOW WELL IT WAS PLENTY TO GET THAT. DO YOU THINK IT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND FLORIDA WITH EXPERTS LIKE HAZELDEN BETTY FORD AND OTHERS TO CRAFT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IT ALSO IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS A LOT OF DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHAT IS CODIFIED. WE CAN AND GET PASSED IN IMPLEMENTED NEXT SO THAT IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE PART OF THE PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT CAN GROUP. ALSO BE BEST. A NUMBER OF OTHER BELLS AND PROGRAM SO AND. THERE IS A TIE AND THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE OFFERING PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAPPLING WITH ADDICTION.
