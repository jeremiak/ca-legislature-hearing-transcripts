BUT PART OF THE PURPOSE OF

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.711
TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GIVE US A

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:24.384
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT --

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.219
OF SOME OF THE REHABILITATION

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.421
PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONS

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.323
DEPARTMENT NOW BEFORE I GO

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.925
FURTHER WITH THAT.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:37.797
WE ARE -- R.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:38.965
J. LACKEY MEDI THE JOINT

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.633
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.936
DIRECTED THE STATE AUDITOR TO DO

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.638
AN AUDIT OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.440
CORRECTIONS REHAB PROGRAMS AND

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.409
THAT AUDIT WAS RELEASED.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.544
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.580
AND WE WILL HAVE.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.615
THE AUDITOR HERE.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.050
AT FUTURE HEARING TALK ABOUT

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.518
THOSE FINDINGS.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.386
I'M BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.622
WORTHWHILE TO YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.792
SO.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.328
JUST IN THE CONTEXT ON FREE THE

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.597
RECESSION.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.698
CALIFORNIA HAD.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.666
SOME VERY MINIMAL REHABILITATIVE

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.835
PROGRAMS IN.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.370
OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT BUT

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.838
WE DIDN'T EVEN ADD.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.808
THE WORD WE DIDN'T ADD TO OUR TO

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.042
THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.344
WHAT YEAR WAS THAT ADDED SENATOR

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.514
BILL DO YOU RECALL.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.352
OKAY BUT IT WAS IT WAS.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.087
BUT IT WAS OWN MORE.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.922
NO NO NO IT WAS MORE IN THE YEAH

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.524
I WAS GONNA SAY IT WAS IN THE

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.425
EARLY TWO THOUSANDS SO WAS NOT

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.860
THAT LONG AGO.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.396
SO WE DID NOT VIEW.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.597
OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT AS A

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.267
AS WE DO NOT VIEW THAT IT HAD A

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.602
REHABILITATIVE PURPOSE UNTIL.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.005
AS LATE AS TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.173
THEN VERY QUICKLY THERE AFTER WE

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.642
HIT THE RECESSION.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.577
AND WE PRETTY MUCH SLASHED THE

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.146
FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.581
SO WE DIDN'T REALLY START.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.617
REINVESTING IN REHABILITATION

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.386
WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONS DIVISION

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.588
UNTIL ABOUT.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.789
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT AND SO

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.190
REALLY WE'VE NOT HAD GOOD

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.559
INVESTMENT INTO A MUCH MORE

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.493
RECENTLY.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.695
ADDITIONALLY.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.697
WHEN WE LOOK AT I MEAN SO WHAT'S

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:18.765
THE PURPOSE OF OUR

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.767
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS?

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.635
DEPENDING ON ONE'S PERSPECTIVE

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.004
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THE VAST

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.774
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT WE HOLD

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.976
IN OUR STATE PRISONS GO HOME.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.244
THEY RETURN HOME AT SOME POINT

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.245
OR ANOTHER.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.647
AND SO.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.016
THE ONE VERY VALID PERSPECTIVE

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.518
IS IF WE ARE.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.586
HOLDING PEOPLE FOR A CERTAIN

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.820
PERIOD OF TIME WE KNOW THEY'RE

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:41.888
GOING TO RETURN HOME

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:42.188
[inaudible]

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.358
INDEPENDENT OF OF TRYING TO KEEP

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.060
RECIDIVISM LOW.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.395
WE OBVIOUSLY OUR JOB IS TO IS

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.598
PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.299
IS TO DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THE

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.201
SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.302
WE WANT.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.104
ONCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD IN

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.806
OUR FACILITIES AND THEN RETURNED

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:00.673
HOME.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.508
WE WE WANT TO HAVE DONE THE BEST

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:06.145
JOB POSSIBLE. TO HAVE THEM.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.314
THRIVE AND BE ABLE TO RE ENTER

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.549
IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE FOR OUR

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.517
COMMUNITIES.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.186
AND SAFE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.188
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.489
PURPOSES OF OUR REHABILITATIVE

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.524
PROGRAMS.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.361
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THEM

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.896
REALLY IN REINVESTED IN THEM IN

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.598
REALLY A PRETTY MORE PRETTY

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.101
SHORTER RECENT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.937
IT'S HARD WHILE THE LA --

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.473
NOT ELIO POLICIES.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.308
THE AN AUDITOR.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.009
HAS IDENTIFIED SOME VERY

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.610
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'LL HEAR

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.611
ABOUT WHEN THEY AUDIT YOUR

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.313
PRESENTS.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.281
IT'S HARD TO DO A REALLY GOOD

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.783
ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.485
NUMBER BECAUSE OF THE SHORT

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.953
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.987
THAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.322
INVESTING IN THEM.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.092
AND SO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.228
PARTIALLY TODAY WAS TO GET SOME

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.030

PROGRAMS TO GIVE US A LITTLE

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.403
CONTEXT SO THAT THEN WHEN WE

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.404
HEAR FROM THE AUDITOR IT'LL HELP

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.871

SUCCESSFUL MITIGATING IMPACT

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:16.963
OTHER REHABILITATIVE ARE JOB.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.131
I'M WHO WILL IN TURN HAVE TWENTY

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:20.633
MEN.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.235
THE GROWTH IN THE ABILITY TO

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.638
PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL THIS PROPOSAL.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.340
THERE ARE TWO POINTS --

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.174
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:28.908

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:36.682
THROUGH OUR TAPING COSTAS --

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.918
TESTING WHICH IS BASIC ARM

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.286
LITERACY LEVELS THAT ARE TESTED

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.854
THROUGHOUT PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.956
EDUCATIONAL ASSIGNMENTS.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.024
OTHERS USUALLY YOU'LL HEAR

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:50.429
MASQUERADE LEVELS ONE THROUGH.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:51.030
NINE AND SO WILL BE MEASURING

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:51.931
THOSE STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:52.698
IN THIS MENTOR PROGRAM TO MAKE

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:53.532
SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING --

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.334
EDUCATIONAL LITERACY GAINES AND

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.102
IN TERMS OF LEVELS AND

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.169
ULTIMATELY WILL BE MEASURING

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.537
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:00.306
EQUIVALENCIES THAT THEY AREN'T

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:00.773
AS WELL.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.408
SO THOSE ARE MEASURABLE

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.943
COMBINATIONS PLUS LOOKING AT

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.144
HOURS THAT THEY SPEND IN THE

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.779
LITERACY PROGRAM.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:07.613
HOURS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.981
AN ACADEMIC MOVING WILL GIVE US

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.149
A REALLY ROBUST --

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.118
ABILITY TO TO MEASURE SUCCESS IN

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.687
THE PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.255
IT WAS ONE FINAL THING THAT I

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:17.256
JUST WANTED TO BRING UP THAT I'M

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:19.625
WAS MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSAL

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.393
AND THE LA --

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.627
WILL BRING UP PROBABLY AS A

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:24.630
CONCERN IS THE ABILITY --

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.465
TO SUPPLANT CBT I IN TERMS OF

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:27.867
CRIMINAL THINKING AS PART OF THE

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.335
COMPONENTS FOR THE MODULES.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.636
RELATED TO THIS LITERACY MENTOR

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.471
PROGRAM THERE IS SOME CRIMINAL

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.940
THINKING ON THIS GOING TO BE S.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.341
THAT WE WERE NOT PLANNING TO

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.309
HAVE.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.477
THOSE CRIMINAL THINKING SLOTS

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:39.845
THAT ARE DONE WITH OUR C. B. T.

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.347
FACILITATORS.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.517
USED BY OUR IN MAY MENTORS THIS

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.685
IS ESSENTIAL IDEA HERE IS THAT

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.585
THEY G THROUGH SOME LEVEL OF

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:48.154
CRIMINAL THINKING APPROXIMATELY

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.589
40% OF OUR POPULATION ALREADY IS

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.657
ASSESSED FOR CRIMINAL THINKING.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:54.894
SO IF THEY TAKE IT WOULD NOT

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.429
REQUIRE THEM TO TAKE IT AGAIN.

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.630
THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:58.464
ASSESSED FOR CRIMINAL THINKING

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.398
PART OF THE CURRICULUM IS BEING

00:09:59.465 --> 00:09:59.932
DEVELOPED AND LED BY THE

ONE OF THE MODULES FOR THE

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:04.103
TRAINING.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.671
AND THEY WILL TAKE IT THERE SO

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.640
THAT THEY'RE NOT --

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:08.774
IMPACTING OUR CPT.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.677

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.649
PROPOSAL.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.750

THE C. B. T. --

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:44.210
COMPONENT IN ADDITION TO THAT DO

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.211

PROGRAM WE ARE NOT ENTIRELY SURE

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:47.446
THIS WOULD BE A COST EFFECTIVE

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.849
PROGRAM --

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:50.750
NOTABLY INMATE MENTORSHIP I

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:51.650
HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED TO BE

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.185
EFFECTIVE IN THIS CONTEXT

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.520
PREVIOUSLY.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:58.157
THAT WE RECOMMEND PURSUING THIS

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:23.983
WE THINK THIS WOULD BE OF ENOUGH

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.884
TIME TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.584

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.323
ARE REALLY ADDRESSING THAT

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.991
DYNAMIC COMMITTED GENIC FACTORS

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.026
SO --

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.694
ASSESSING BOTH THAT THEY HAVE A

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.629
CRIMINAL THINKING NEED GETTING

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.898
THEM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.000
YOU AND THEN MAINTAIN --

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.435
BEHAVIORAL CHANGE OR SURROUND US

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.139
THE ADDED VALUATIONS --

OF THE CRIMINAL THINKING.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:03.676
ARE THERE VALUATIONS OF WHO DOES

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.377
IT.

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:06.312
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:06.879
SPECIFIC EVALUATION COMMIT

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:08.380
THINKING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:08.948
CURRICULUM THAT IS EVIDENCE

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.416
BASED ON AND I THINK SOME OF IT

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:11.984
ACTUALLY IS IN THE QUEUE RESULTS

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.586

READING PROBLEMS --

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.110
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOUR MODEL

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.611
INVOLVES THAT.

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.213
IS THAT TRUE.

OUR CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION

YOU'RE PROPOSING THEY ARE

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.756
ACCREDITED TEACHERS THAT WILL BE

PRINCIPLES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:41.840
HAVING A FORMAL STRUCTURE.

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.042
MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING

OF EDUCATION CREDENTIALS.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:03.462
I DON'T BELIEVE OUR TEACHERS

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.997
WERE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:05.864

EVALUATION OTHER READING ISSUES.

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.411
AND WHY THEY HAVE READING ISSUES

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:19.712
[inaudible]

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:21.880
STEPPING DOWN [inaudible]

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:24.383
DURING A DOT A DIAGNOSTIC

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.984
EVALUATION.

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:26.485
AS DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.520
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROBLEMS FOR

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:29.321
READING METERS.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.991
WIDE RANGE OF REASONS WHY IT.

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:35.127
PEOPLE ARE DEFICIENT IN REASON

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.495
AND READING ABILITIES.

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.397
ABSOLUTELY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.898
THE MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENT

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:41.700
OF IT BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE GIVE

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.202
OUT THE TAPE --

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:44.737
WHICH IS THE TEST OF ADULT BASIC

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.538
EDUCATION AND THE COST SAYS

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.374
WHICH IS FEDERALLY DRIVEN THOSE

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.541
ARE TASK THAT.

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:52.311
ARE ABLE TO DIVE VERY DEEP INTO --

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.012
THE COMPONENTS OF WHERE PEOPLE

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.182
ARE STRUGGLING SO FOR INSTANCE

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:57.983
WE GIVEN ACOSTA SETTLEMENT.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.386
THEY CAN GO DOWN TO THE VERY

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:03.789
LOCAL LEVEL TO THAT OFFENDER AS

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.357
OF NEEDS THEY HAVE MIGHT BE

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.658
TELLING TIME OR SIMPLE MATH SO

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:07.826
THE CEDIT HE TEACHERS CAN

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.361
REALLY FOCUS.

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.597
ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:12.531
THAT STUDENTS SO ACROSS THIS TAX

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.933
IS A REALLY ROBUST ANALYSIS AND

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.734
THE BACK END OF THAT SYSTEM

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.536
PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL DATA FOR US

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.872

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.974
THEIR TARGETED NEEDS.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.142
SO ARE MEDICAL DOCTORS INVOLVED

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:26.011
THESE EVALUATIONS.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.479
NOW NOT SAID NONE OF SOMETIMES

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.716
THE REASONING BEHIND YOUR

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.351
READING DIFFICULTIES INVOLVES

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.086
CONDITIONS THAT ARE PICKED UP BY

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.555
A MEDICAL DOCTORS --

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.824
AND IT'S QUITE COMMON ACTUALLY

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.359
IT'S MORE COMMON ACTUALLY

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:41.627
REALIZE --

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:44.062
WHEN YOU LOOK AT CHILDREN AND

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.264
ADULTS THEIR READING PROBLEMS

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.832
ARE ACADEMIC TEACHERS AND I'M

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.066
SORRY I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.301
QUESTION ACTUALLY OUR ACADEMIC

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:50.903
TEACHERS DO LOOK AT MEDICAL

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.338
ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE DONE --

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.374
TO DEDICATE STAFFING JUST TO

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.643
THOSE WITH ABOVE COGNITIVE AND

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.411
PHYSICAL DISABILITIES SO THOSE

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.312
ASSESSMENTS DONE BY MEDICAL ARE

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.047
INCLUDED IN OUR STRATEGIC

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:04.316
OFFENDER MANAGER THEY LOOK AT

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:05.317
WHEN THEY SEE SOME OF THE

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.619
READING PROBLEMS THAT THEY DO A

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:09.688
READING MEDICAL ASSESSMENT TO

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:10.522
SEE IF THEY HAVE.

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:15.928
PROBLEMS WITH HER EYES --

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:16.562
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS I

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:19.031
MEAN THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.065
REASONS YOU KNOW THAT THE BILL

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.134
IN A BILL TO FOCUS.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.236
ON WORDS YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:27.306
REASON --

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:30.175
DYSLEXIA IS --

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.310
SPECTRUM.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:35.447
YEAH THERE'S ALL KINDS OF TYPE

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:35.881
TO THAT --

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.783
THE GOVERNOR HAS TALKED ABOUT

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.918
THAT HIMSELF HAVING IT HIMSELF

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:40.786
YOU KNOW.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.690
ON IN A VERY HONEST --

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:45.657
VERY PROUD OF OUR GOVERNOR FOR

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.659
DOING THAT.

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:48.861
PEOPLE ARE --

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.429
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE KINDS OF

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.431
THINGS HE WANTS TO DO WITHOUT.

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:57.302
AND SO I I I THINK THE DEBT.

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:58.537
THE PART THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

00:18:58.604 --> 00:18:59.371
NEEDS TO BE.

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.607
EXPLAINED BETTER AND YOUR

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:02.474
PROPOSAL [inaudible]

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.310
OKAY -- THEN

IN TERMS OF IS IS A MATTER OF

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.094
LIKE IN A LOT OF CASES TRAINING

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:58.163
THAT HIGH. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.566
READ SOMETHING [inaudible]

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:05.470
AND IS THAT PART OF YOUR

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.438
PROPOSAL FOR THE READING

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.073
LITERACY.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.207
PART OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY IS

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:12.177
MACHINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IS --

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.645
WE HAVE A SEPARATE WE HAVE A

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:18.050
NUMBER OF DISABILITY.

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.084
REPLACEMENT ITEMS TO HELP PEOPLE

ACHIEVE READING IF THEY'RE

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.421
STRUGGLING WITH THEIR VISION ARE

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:24.089
STRUGGLING WITH A TIME BUT IN

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.324
ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE ALSO

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.191
IMPLEMENT IT --

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.693
TECHNOLOGY BASED THINGS LIKE

READING HORIZONS OR AZTEC WHICH

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:31.863
ARE PROGRAMS.%

PEOPLE AN ADDITIONAL STRUCTURED

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:37.703
TIME --

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.605
SURROUNDING THOSE ITEMS SO --

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:43.141
THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:43.442
THEY ARE --

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:47.312
KIND OF A SUPPLEMENT PLAYING --

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.081
THOSE.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:51.583
TOOLS AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.920
KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT.

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:59.391
THAT IN TERMS OF GOALS OF OF OF

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.659
AND THEN IN TERMS OF HOW WE

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:01.793
PRIORITIZE.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.564
THE PROGRAM LIKE.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.365
HOW DO YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.733
ATTACKING?

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:08.400
SEVERITY --

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:10.535
OF READING PROBLEMS OR YOU JUST

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:11.003
DOING -- IN

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.838
A GENERAL WAY.

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.039
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE WORST

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.842
PROBLEMS.

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:20.045
OR YOU DON'T IN A GENERAL WAY.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:20.779
HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:22.047
APPROACHING RIGHT NOW --

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.982
OUR MAIN FOCUS IS THOSE THAT

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.218
HAVE HIGHER LITERACY LEVELS THAT

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:28.053
ARE KIND OF MEETING THAT I'VE

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.521
TARGETED FOCUS THAT THAT CAN BE

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.056
ACHIEVED RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.190
THAT LEAVES MORE TIME FOR OUR

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:33.759
CREDIT ACADEMIC INSTRUCTORS TO

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.227
FOCUS ON THOSE WITH LOWER LEVELS

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:36.194
OF LITERACY.

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:37.295
WE'RE NOT XCLUDING THE LOWER

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.731
LEVEL LITERACY AS PART OF THE

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.266
PROGRAM'S REALLY IS MENTORS ARE

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:42.634
NOT INTENDED TO SUPPLANT.

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.702
I'M EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:44.836
WHICH ARE REALLY CRITICAL IN

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:46.271
GETTING PEOPLE'S LOWER LEVEL

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.640
LITERACY IS UP TO A HIGHER LEVEL.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.541
AS THE WERE FOCUSED ON THE

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.343
HIGHER LEVEL MORE ALSO FOCUSED

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.045
ON THOSE WOULD BE CLOSEST TO A

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:55.213
RELEASE SO THAT PEOPLE WITH A

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.715
COUPLE OF YEARS ORA YEAR OR

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:57.249
MONTHS.

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.484
CAN HAVE SOME TARGETED

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:03.155
INSTRUCTION BEFORE.

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:03.922
OKAY -- I

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.390
DON'T THINK YOU'RE PROPOSAL

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:06.658
EXPLAINS THAT GOOD ENOUGH I

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.593
THINK. ONE OF ONE OF THE ONE OF

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.162
THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:13.298
IS.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.433
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS I ALWAYS LIKE

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:17.903
TO SEE IF YOU'RE.

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.372
IS KIND OF LIKE SPECIAL ED HERE

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.207
IS WHAT WE'RE DONE WITH --

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:23.508
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THE MOST

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.510
SEVERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:27.245
THING TO DO.

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:29.247
A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:31.116
TO DO IT SO I I I KIND OF HOPE

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.918
THAT YOU.

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:35.821
WE'LL THINK ABOUT.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:37.289
HOW YOU MAKE YOUR PRIORITIES AND

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.491
NOT JUST --

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:43.862
HELLO THE MODERATES AND AS

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.363
OPPOSED TO SERVE YEARS IN TERMS

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.767
OF READING READING DIFFICULTY

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:49.401
THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:50.335
MANAGER.

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:59.010
THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE.

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:03.381
IT SEEMS INTUITIVE THAT --

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:03.982
THEIR READING SKILLS.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.751
I'M.

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:07.486
BUT TO HAVE.

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:10.589
I I DIDN'T.

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:12.991
LIKE SEE A STUDY THAT KIND OF A

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.693
FIRM THAT I REMEMBER THERE'S

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.460
PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM BUT DO WE

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:16.762
HAVE ANY.

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.964
STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT A READING

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.266
LITERACY PROGRAM IS USED.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.502
IN A STATE AND HERE WERE THE

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.337
RESULTS OVER A PERIOD TIME.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:26.705
I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STUDY TO

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:27.906
REFERENCE FOR THE LITERACY

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.141
PROGRAM BUT I KNOW THAT THERE

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:30.976
ARE NUMBER OF PEER TO PEER

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.477
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST OUT THERE --

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.112
AND I I BELIEVE THERE'S ONE

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.148
STATE THAT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:38.383
AN ENTIRE INMATE DRIVEN TEACHING

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.418
SYSTEM FROM ACTUAL EDUCATION TO

00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:42.020
VOCATIONAL PART OF WHAT WE KNOW

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:42.687
HERE.

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.856
IS THE BASE FACT THAT PEOPLE

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.958
WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF LITERACY

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:49.661
OR THAT ACHIEVED THAT HIGH

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:50.896
SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA WILL

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:53.031
DO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY ARE

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:53.799
RELEASED IN TERMS OF OR SAID

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:55.233
ABOUT THEM WE HAD SOME INITIAL

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:55.801
NUMBERS.

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:56.668
I'M THAT ARE STILL PRELIMINARY

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.170
THERE'S A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHICS

00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:59.504
THAT HAVE TO BE ANALYZED AROUND

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.505
IT BUT FOR THOSE --

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:02.174
PEOPLE THAT WERE RELEASED IN

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.542
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT HAD A

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:04.176
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:05.243
EQUIVALENT SEE.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.545
THEIR RECIDIVISM ONE YEAR

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.180
CONVICTION RATE WAS ABOUT NINE

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:09.314
POINT 5%.

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.784
WHEN YOU LOOK AT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:16.254
WHICH IS A TO RELATIONS ONE YOUR

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.956
CONVICTION RATE IT'S EIGHTEEN

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.258
POINT 3% SO ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.393
APPLES TO APPLES THERE'S MORE

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.694
THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITH THAT'S

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:23.829
INITIALLY SAYING IS?

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.831
THERE'S NEARLY A 50% DROP IN

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:28.767
ACTIONS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:29.401
THOSE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS WORK

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:29.734
OF ONE SEES.

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:30.735
IT'S VERY PRELIMINARY WE NEED TO

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.070
DO MORE ABOUT IT BASICALLY

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.405
SUPPORTS THE FACT IN THERE'S A

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.906
NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.375
OUT THERE FROM RAND. TO OTHER

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.311
PLACES AS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:40.979
OR EQUIVALENT SEE THOSE OF THE

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:41.613
WAYS TO TARGET PEOPLE BEFORE THE

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.314
RELEASE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.149
GOING TO BE HELPFUL TO THEM.

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.750
IF SOMEBODY HAS --

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:47.352
A CVT NEED OR VOCATIONALLY BUT

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:49.487
THEY CAN ACTUALLY READ THAT'S

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.156
NOT GONNA HELP THEM AS MUCH SO

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:52.424
REALLY HAVING THIS ACADEMIC

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.159
LITERACY SUPPORT IS CRITICAL I

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:55.694
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.262
BASED PRINCIPLES.

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.898
AND DATA SURROUNDING IT TO SAY

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:04.436
GETTING PEOPLE FOR THIS

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:05.003
EDUCATIONAL LITERACY LEVELS

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.138
REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:10.108
SO WHILE YOU'RE ANSWERING CENTER

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.043
BELLS QUESTIONS I JUST LOOK UP

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.182
ON MY IPHONE BUT CAST.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:18.583
PROGRAMS ARE STUDIES ROUTE THERE

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.785
IN WHAT CAME UP WHEN I KEYED IN

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:23.221
A FEW KEY WORDS.

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:25.390
WAS A A SITE CALLED PRISON

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.925
FELLOWSHIP.

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:30.095
WHICH AS A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:31.863
WHERE.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.497
PEOPLE CAN COME AND HELP EACH.

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:35.333
INMATES HOW TO READ I'M JUST

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.668
WONDERING DO WE TAP INTO A

00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:37.836
VOLUNTEER BASIS SPECIALLY WITH

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:41.273
THE A SENIOR RETIREE POPULATION

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:42.440
IS GROWING.

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:43.008
I KNOW THATWE HAVE A

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.442
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.344
THAT COME IN BOTH ON THEIR OWN

00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:47.946
INTER INNOVATIVE GRANTS.

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:49.881
I DO.

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:50.515
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OFF THE TOP

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:51.283
MAN BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET YOU

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:52.918
SOME INFORMATION ON WHETHER WE

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:53.118
HAVE.

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:54.986
EDUCATIONAL.

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.322
HERE STUDENT TUTORS I KNOW THAT

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.224
IT HAPPENS I'M JUST YOU KNOW

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.125
WHEN YOU GO AND VISIT AN

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.861
INSTITUTION OFTEN ARE.

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:04.863
MATERIALS DESCRIBED.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.132
AND NUMBER OF THE VOLUNTARY ON

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.366
THE THE VOLUNTEER EDUCATION

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:11.403
PROGRAMS AND ALSO DESCRIBED A

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:11.603
BILL.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.439
WHICH I ESTABLISH THEM UNDER

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.707
SENATOR HANCOCK SO THERE ARE I

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:19.144
DON'T KNOW ROBUST.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.212
GREEN I AM [inaudible]

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:24.082
STILL AT CORRECTIONS ONE A ONE

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.683
SO.

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:26.518
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS I'M

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:27.319
TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW MANY

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.820
SO WE DO HAVE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.722
IN OUR STATE PRISONS AND

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:32.257
INDIVIDUALS.

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.191
SO HOW DO WE MERGE THE

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.926
VOLUNTEERS WITH.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.162
THE THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS THAT

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:37.395
YOU'RE.

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.864
TRYING TO ADD.

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:42.367
I THINK THIS IS A DISTINCT

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.203
PROGRAM BUT THOSE VOLUNTEERS

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.471
CREATE A CULTURE THAT WE FULLY

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:47.872
SUPPORT I THINK IT CONTINUES TO

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:48.673
HELP.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.275
THE BASIC CONCEPTS AS WE HAVE IF

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.043
WE SAY WE HAVE 62% OF PEOPLE

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.411
THAT DO NOT HAVE THEIR HIGH

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:54.946
SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENCY.

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:57.849
IN OUR INSTITUTIONS THERE IS

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:58.950
ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE --

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.318
AND THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM TO GROW

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.153
SO I THINK I'LL GO BACK AND LOOK

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.289
AT THESE THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:05.757
SURE THAT WE ARE COMBINING BIRTH

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.158
APPROPRIATELY --

00:27:07.225 --> 00:27:08.693
BUT THEY REALLY CAN STILL STAND

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.527
ON THEIR OWN I BELIEVE AND

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:10.862
ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT WHICH IS

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:13.398
GETTING PEOPLE HIGH SCHOOL

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.633
DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE PRIOR

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.934
TO RELEASE.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.535
AND THEN.

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.471
HOW DO YOU ASKED BECAUSE READING

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:20.271
IS WANTING COMPREHENSION IS

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:22.240
ANOTHER?

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:22.941
IS THIS ORDER.

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.410
COME OUT OF THE THE THE READING

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.911
HORIZONS PROGRAM DO THEY KIND OF

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:33.651
THE KIND OF GREAT OR ANALYZE HOW.

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:36.688
SOMEONE IS IMPROVING HE'S BEEN.

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:37.288
ON THEIR READING SKILLS IN THE

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:38.923
RETENTION SKILLS.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.192
OUR OUR BASIC ASSESSMENTS ARE

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:42.961
DONE THROUGH OUR TAPING COSTS.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:43.628
WHICH ARE STANDARDIZED

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.829
ASSESSMENTS OUR INSTRUCTORS GIVE

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.064
OUT AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:48.066
HOURS OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.234
BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.769
BOTH READING HORIZONS AND ASKED

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:51.436
TECH -- AS

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.805
PEOPLE ANSWER QUESTIONS THEY RE

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:55.340
FOCUS ON THOSE TARGETS BUT THEY

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.875
MIGHT HAVE MISSED THINGS OR

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:57.709
OFFER UP SOLUTIONS THANKS TO

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.911
FOCUS ON SO ALL OF THE PROGRAMS

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:01.246
THAT WE USE --

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.747
GO BACK TO WHAT TARGETED NEEDS

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:04.315
MIGHT BE THERE AND THEN ARE

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:04.916
STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT THERE

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.951
WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO USE IN

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:12.023
TERMS OF GRADE LEVEL GROWTH.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.324
IS THERE A COMPONENT OF SAY

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:14.759
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THIS

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.694
OP OR THAT KIND OF HIS.

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.830
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALREADY WAY

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.031
BEYOND LEVEL WE NEED TO MOVE YOU

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.599
UP WITH A HIGHER.

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:24.502
IT WOULD IT WOULD DISPLAY IN OUR

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.204
WHERE WE REALLY FOCUSED BUT IF

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:26.938
THEY WERE DOING A SOFTWARE SO

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:28.239
READING HORIZONS FOR INSTANCE IS

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.641
USUALLY PEOPLE BETWEEN.

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:30.375
A GRADE LEVEL --

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:32.610
OF ZERO TO FOURTH GRADE AND SO

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:33.211
IT REALLY FOCUSES ON THOSE OF

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:34.946
THOSE LOWER LITERACY LEVELS AND

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:35.980
IF THEY WERE SEEING ACADEMIC

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:36.748
GROWTH --

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:37.649
IMPROVEMENT AFTER A CERTAIN

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:39.284
NUMBER F HOURS THEY WOULD GET

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.752
REASSESS THROUGH OUR TABOR COSTS

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.854
THIS TEST AND THEN THEY WOULD BE

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:45.356
PLACED INTO A HIGHER LEVEL

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:46.524
PROGRAM BASED ON THAT TEACHER.

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:51.930
REVIEWING BUT THOSE TEST SCORES

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:52.464
AND THEIR ACADEMIC GRASS.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.367
AND THIS VOTE HOW MANY OTHER

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.369
PROGRAMS BACK TO ONE A ONE HOW

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.537

FOR THE A WHOLE LOT BUT BASS

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.980
FIRE FIRE.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.382
TRAINING.

CAN AND HOW MANY CAN YOU SIGN UP.

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:14.385
FOR ONE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:15.253
LIMIT ON SIGNING UP FOR PROGRAMS

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:15.920
I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT.

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.255
WHAT THE SCHEDULE LOOKS LIKE IN

00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.724
THE ABILITY FOR THE --

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.693
AND MADE ACTUALLY ATTEND A FIRE

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:24.095
CAMP YOU COULD BE IN THAT

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:25.563

READING.

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.199
I IMAGINE THAT THE THE READING

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.234
PROGRAM AS WERE ROLLING IT OUT

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:29.801
THAT HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.970
THINGS LOCATED IN THE PRISON --

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:32.670
BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR OF

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:33.972
VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:36.007
WHICH IS ARE ACCREDITED

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:36.574
INSTRUCTORS THAT HELP OUT OF

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:39.410
FIRE CAMPS.

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.111
GREAT THANK YOU MANAGER THANK

00:29:58.263 --> 00:29:58.963
THIS.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.333
IT INDICATES THAT IN SEVENTEEN

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.636
EIGHTEEN THERE WAS A ESTIMATION

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:07.505
OF ABOUT 41%.

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:11.543
OR FORTY FOUR THOUSAND OFFENDERS

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:12.877

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:19.851
THAT THERE'S BEEN WELL PERHAPS

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:22.921
NOT A FULL ON ASSESSMENT OF ALL

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.556
INMATES.

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:25.857
SOME LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT OF A

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.859
GOOD PROPORTION OF VIDEO DIDN'T

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.928
SEEM TO INDICATE THAT.

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:31.563
I MIGHT HAVE I MIGHT HAVE.

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:34.432
NOT BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH.

SO WHEN.

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:38.570
WHEN ANY IN MAY COMES IN TWO THE

DCR THE RECEPTION CENTER AS LONG

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.272
AS THEY'RE NOT ONE OF THE

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:42.473
EXCLUSIONARY GREATER THEY WILL

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.241
GET A COMPASS ASSESSMENT?

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.176
WHICH ASSESSES THEIR DYNAMIC

00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:47.245
COMMISSION IT NEEDS ONE OF THOSE

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:49.180
COMPONENTS IS CRIMINAL THINKING

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:49.881
WHAT YOU'RE READING IS PROBABLY --

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.015
WHAT THAT IS FROM WHICH IS ABOUT

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:54.452
40% OF THOSE COME INTO CITIES

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.721
OUR STATE INSTITUTION THAT ARE

00:30:56.788 --> 00:31:02.293
AUTOMATICALLY ASSESSED AS A

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.263
MODERATE TO HIGH FOR CRIMINAL?

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.931
SO ASA HIGH NEED FOR CRIMINAL

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:10.501
PERSONALITY THERAPY YES.

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.704
INTERCHANGEABLE SO SO I'M SORRY

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.938
WELL GIVEN THAT.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.640
YOUR PROPOSAL THE MINISTRATIONS

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.641
PROPOSAL.

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.077
SAYS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE THIS

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:21.012
THERE BE TO EVERY INMATE WHO WAS

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.013
PART OF THIS MENTOR PROGRAM SO

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.780
THAT WOULD.

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.082
BE INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER THEY

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:24.682
WERE IT MODERATE TO HIGH NEED

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:24.983
[inaudible]

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.951
GIVEN THAT.

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:29.454
I MEAN THAT I THINK THE ALEJO'S

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.488
POINT THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE A

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.056
LOT OF SENSE.

00:31:32.123 --> 00:31:32.690
IS LEGITIMATE WHY WOULDN'T YOU

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.692
ONLY REQUIRE THAT FOR THOSE WHO

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.526
WERE.

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:36.427
ASSESSED AT MODERATE TO HIGH

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:37.895
NEED.

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:39.063
SO THOSE THAT WERE ASSESSED

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.865
MOTOR TINY WILL ALREADY BE A

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:41.432
PART OF THE C. B. T. PROGRAM

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:44.102
WHICH IS.

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:45.903
WHAT WE'RE READING INDICATES NOT

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.871
EVERYONE IS RECEIVED THAT SO I

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.172
DID SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.941
PROVIDE IT FOR EVERYBODY AT ONCE?

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:56.381
SO CLEARLY IT'S YOU PROBABLY

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:57.482
HAVE A BACKLOG.

00:31:57.548 --> 00:32:00.618
SO WHY WOULD YOU REQUIRE IT. FOR

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:03.521
THOSE IN YOUR MENTOR PROGRAM WHO

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:04.656
ARE NOT ASSESSED AT MODERATE TO

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.924
HIGH.

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.560
THOSE IN THE PROGRAM THAT WERE

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:10.228
NOT AS FAST AS A MODERATE I NEED

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:11.696
WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO TAKE

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.698
PART OF THE C. B. T. PROGRAM

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:14.732
THAT EXCESS.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.401
WEIGHT THEY ARE AS PART OF THE

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:17.669
CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION WITH THE

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:18.469
VOLUNTARY EDUCATION.

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:19.070
GOING TO BE TAUGHT CRIMINAL

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.805
THINKING OPPONENTS BECAUSE A LOT

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.106
OF THE POPULATION THAT THEY MAY

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:24.208
BE INTERACTING WITH HAVE A

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:25.143
CRIMINAL THINKING ASSESSMENT.

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:28.846
SO A LOT OF IT WAS ATTACKED I

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:30.214
WANT TO SAY LIKE A TRAIN THE

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.182
TRAINER APPROACH HAVING THEM

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:32.283
UNDERSTAND THOSE CRIMINAL

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.484
THINKING BEHAVIORS WILL ALSO

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.186
HELP THEM INTERACT WITH POSSIBLY

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.587
THE VOLUNTARY STUDENTS.

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:40.825
NOW IF THEY ALREADY ARE SETTLED

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:41.459
IT'S NOT WRITTEN THAT WAY RIGHT

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:47.198
SO YOU NEED TO NOW IF THERE.

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.867
I WILL WE WILL CLARIFY BUT THAT

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:50.368
IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.236
PROPOSAL.

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:59.310
I'M ALL RIGHT SO NEXT POINT --

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:00.611
BACK TO MISTER SENATOR BELLS

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.347
POINTS ABOUT.

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:03.981
AN ADEQUATE ASSESSMENT TO LEARN

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:05.983
HOW TO READ.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.752
IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:12.390
UNDERLYING ISSUES OF SAY VISION.

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.192
OR SOMETHING ON THE SPECTRUM OF

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:14.792
LEX YES.

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.194
WE'RE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.028
THAT.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:17.829
COULD IMPEDE ONE'S ABILITY TO

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:20.131
READ.

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:23.000
THAT HAS TO BE IDENTIFIED

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:23.301
[inaudible]

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:25.970
BEFORE.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:29.073
pOUT OF TEN TO ASSIST SOMEONE TO

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:29.707
BE ABLE --

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:31.743
TO LEARN HOW TO READ.

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.478
SO IF THAT HASN'T BEEN

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:34.679
IDENTIFIED.

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.381
AND WE HAVE MENTORS BRING TO

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:38.082
HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO READ.

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:40.351
WE CAN CREATE A VERY FRUSTRATING

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:42.887
CIRCUMSTANCE BOTH FOR THE INMATE.

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:44.956
WHO IS TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.424
READ AND THE AND THE INMATE WAS

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:46.991
MEANT BRING THEM?

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:48.793
IF THAT UNDERLYING SO YOU

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.761
DESCRIBE A THING WHERE YOU THE

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:52.163
ASSESSMENT TOOLS CAN DISCOVER

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.464
FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER.

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.933
YOU SAID TO ME ABOUT RECOGNIZING

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.070
NUMERALS FOR TELLING TIME I

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.239

ANOTHER POINT THAT I WANTED.

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:03.160
TO YES I KNOW.

00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:05.696

WHICH MARIN APARTMENT FINANCE

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:18.009
WANT TO NOTE THAT WE SEE THIS AS

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.477
A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REACH A

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:21.279
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INMATES.

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:21.612
ON THE LA --

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.080
MAN MENTIONED A RAMP UP PERIOD

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:25.249
AND BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.183
RAMP UP HERE IT IS GOING TO TAKE

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.519
TIME TO ROLL THE PROGRAM OUT WE

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:31.322
THINK PILOTING IT WILL JUST TO

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:36.193
LIKE TO AVOID --

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.529
ALL RIGHT I'M.

MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:45.803
IS THERE A WAY TO QUANTIFY.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.003
I GOT.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.939
THE RESULTS.

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:48.906
IMPROVE READING SKILLS IS THERE

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:51.142
ARE SOME.

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.343
THROUGH SOME WAY THAT THE

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.844
RECIDIVISM GOES DOWN WHICH THEN

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:56.247
THEREFORE RESULTS IN LAST.

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:58.015
INCARCERATION WHICH TRANSLATES

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:58.716
INTO THE FOLLOWING DOLLARS SO

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:00.217
THAT WERE SPENDING A DIME TO

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:02.019
MAKE A QUARTER.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:03.921
WE HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:06.557
WELL.

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:08.125
WE'VE THE DEPARTMENT TWENTY

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.360
COLLECTING A NUMBER OF THOSE --

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.861
OUTCOME MEASURES WE CAN SEE THE

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.263
EFFECT OF THE PROGRAM ON

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.332
LITERACY RATES AND THEN WE CAN --

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.767
EXTRAPOLATE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:17.602
MIGHT MEAN FOR RECIDIVISM BUT

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:18.603
THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:19.637
DO THAT EVALUATION AND THEN.

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:21.439
WE COULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO A

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:22.740
HYPOTHETICAL A DOLLAR AMOUNT

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.275
BASED ON HOW MUCH WE THINK THIS

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:26.043
WILL IMPACT RECIDIVISM BUT YES

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.512
THAT IS THE IDEA THAT THIS WILL --

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:29.680
GET A BIG BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.749

FRUSTRATION AND LESS SUCCESS

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.820
NOW.

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:58.088
THAT WE AS A STATE UNDERSTAND

00:40:58.155 --> 00:41:00.090
THAT REHABILITATION IS AN

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:03.894
ESSENTIAL THE CENTRAL COMPONENT

TRAINING IN IN ALL IN MANY MANY

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.742
ASPECTS OF THINGS THAT SOME OF

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:19.877
US MAY HAVE.

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.546
YOU KNOW BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:25.282
TO ACQUIRE EARLIER IN OUR LIFE.

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:26.550
BUT YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE MUST BE

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:29.320
VERY ROBUST PART OF OUR ENTIRE

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:32.189
CORRECTION SYSTEM AND THEY STILL

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:35.059
WE'VE MADE PROGRESS THERE OR

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:37.828
SOMETHING BUT IT'S NOT YET REAL

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:38.629
ROBUST.

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.831

THEIR IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:49.340
POSSIBLE SO I WANT TO PUT THAT

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:52.276
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMENT.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:57.448

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:09.152
AND I THINK BECAUSE HE

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.520
REPRESENTS WHAT'S POSSIBLE WEN

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:13.423
PEOPLE ARE BY THE OPPORTUNITY IN

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.359
THE SUPPORT --

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.593
BE SUCCESSFUL --

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.029
I MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE --

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:20.597
DOES HELP ME BE HERE --

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:24.368
AND MY IN WITHIN MY OWN FAMILY

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:26.236
I'VE SEEN THE THE MULTI

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:30.907
GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.576
UNRESOLVED TRAUMA OF

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:34.077
INCARCERATION.

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:36.246
OUR END RELEASE WITHOUT SOME KEY

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:37.981
SUPPORTS BEING IN PLACE.

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:39.750
MY OWN SISTER SPENT ABOUT.

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:41.918
MOST OF TWENTY YEARS IN JAILS

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:42.819
AND PRISONS GLAZER PRETTY LONG

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.288
STRETCHES AND WHEN SHE WOULD

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:45.656
COME HOME.

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:47.424
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY BETTER

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.792
SENSE OF HOW SHE ENDED UP THERE.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:51.128
AND SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT.

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.195
THERE WAS NO COUNSELING THOSE

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:53.764
THERAPY NO SUPPORT FOR HER TO

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.198
ANSWER THE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.233
HOW.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.101
HER OWN CHILDHOOD.

00:48:58.168 --> 00:49:00.570
EXPERIENCES --

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.439
IMPACT HER DECISIONS IN OUR

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:03.473
ACTIONS --

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.576
AND IT TOOK ME SHE WAS SHE WAS --

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:07.177
IN THE AND FORTIES BEFORE SHE

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:09.946
REALLY CONNECTED TO SOME WORK I

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:12.082
WAS DOING.

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:14.384
AND SO I I STE I KNOW WHAT THAT

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.319
LOOKS LIKE AND I I SEE HOW THAT

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.987
IMPACTS HER KIDS AND HER ABILITY

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.423
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR KIDS.

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:20.991
AND SO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.326
FOCUSED ON REALLY PROVIDING THE

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:24.027
KIND OF COUNSELING AND AND

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:26.430
SUPPORT THAT THAT SHE NEVER HAD.

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:29.633
AND I FIND THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.269
IT'S SO MUCH NEEDED INSIDE THE

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:32.869
INSTITUTION OF PEOPLE REALLY

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.071
HUNGRY.

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.239
FOR I WILL SAY THE WHAT I FOUND

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.708
IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:40.510
OUT OF PRISON --

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.113
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.248
ARE COMING FROM LIFE SENTENCES

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.950
AND AND AND AND FOCUS ON A

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:47.517
POPULATION. FOR THIS

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.386
CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:50.587
THE WORK THEY HAVE TO DO.

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.022
IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.490
PAROLE BOARD THERE NO LONGER WAS

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.392
THE PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:56.026
IS WORK THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS TO

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.861
DO.

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.096
THEY HAVE.

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.630
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEIR OWN

00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:01.932
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:03.667
IMPACT THEIR DECISIONS AND

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.768
ACTIONS.

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:06.169
LED TO LET THEM HURT THEMSELVES

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:08.372
AND OTHERS IF YOU DON'T RESOLVE

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.773
THOSE THINGS WHILE THEY'RE IN

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.241
PRISON THEY CAN'T COME HOME.

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:12.576
SO WHEN THEY DO COME HOME HAVING

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.978
DONE THAT WORK.

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:17.681
I THINK THEY ARE THE ARE THE KEY.

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.049
TO REALLY DISRUPTING VIOLENCE IN

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.584
OUR COMMUNITIES --

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.485
THEY PLAY REALLY CRITICAL ROLE

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:22.719
AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:24.187
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:26.723
EMPLOYMENT ACT PASSED.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.257
AND EVEN MOTHER INSIDE THE

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:28.158
PRISON.

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:30.093
THEY PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.094
IN --

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.096
PROVIDING MENTOR SHIP GUIDANCE

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.631
SUPPORT TO OTHER PEOPLE TRYING

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:35.932
TO TRAIN TRYING TO TRAVEL THE

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.634
SAME ROUTE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.802
THE SAME ANSWERS TO THOSE

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:42.038
QUESTIONS.

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.774
AND SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT --

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.443
IS A GREAT POTENTIAL IN THIS

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.745
THINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:50.013
PRESENCE.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.847
HAVING --

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:53.250
WORK WITH SO MANY PEOPLE INSIDE

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.284
THE PRISON OF IDENTIFIED.

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:57.921
SOME SOME ASPECTS OF SOME OF THE

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.523
BETTER --

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.792
PROGRAMS INSIDE INSTITUTIONS --

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.093
AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH WITH --

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.761
WITH THIS COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:08.432
THE KEY PIECES THAT WE FIND IS

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:11.368
THAT -- WHEN

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:12.502
WE START A CONVERSATION WITH

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:16.740
SOMEONE?

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.775
YOU KNOW THE THE WORST CHILD

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:19.476
EXPERIENCING A REMEMBER.

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:21.111
AND THEY MAY START TO OPEN UP

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.045
ABOUT THAT.

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:23.246
AND WE STE MAY SPEND OUR COUPLE

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.948
HOURS WITH THEM AND THEN I GO

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:26.616
BACK TO MY OFFICE.

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:27.150
AND THEN THERE LEFT IN THE

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:28.452
PRISON.

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.219
WHERE THEY HAVE A GREAT A

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:30.554
SUCCESS IS WHERE THEY CAN

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.255
CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WITH

00:51:32.322 --> 00:51:33.457
THE COMMUNITY?

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.192
WITHIN THE INSTITUTION THAT

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.727
SUPPORTS THAT INQUIRY.

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:38.261
GIVES THEM THE SPACE TO BE

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:39.429
VULNERABLE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:40.997
THINGS SUPPORTS THEM DOESN'T

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.732
JUDGE THEM DOESN'T SHARE THAT

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.134
INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE ART.

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:46.002
OF THOSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:47.537
SEEM TO MAKE THE BIGGEST

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:48.138
DIFFERENCE IN THOSE THE ONES

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.105
THAT -- THEY

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.440
GO BEYOND --

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.642
THINGS LIKE ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.044
AND NARCOTICS.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.846
ANONYMOUS WHICH SIDE THE PRISONS

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:58.482
ARE ANYTHING BUT ANONYMOUS --

00:51:58.548 --> 00:51:59.416
N..

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:02.052
IN AND THEY GO INTO THESE THAT

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:05.522
THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT MANY OF

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:07.190
UNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS --

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.792
BUT THE ONES THAT DO THIS DEEPER

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.794
DEEPER DIVE INTO SOMEONE'S HOME.

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.395
HISTORY AND AND AND LIFE

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:14.431
EXPERIENCES --

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.899
BUT I FOUND THAT THOSE THAT

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.634
THOSE PRISONS THAT HAVE A

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:20.837
SUPPORTIVE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY.

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.672
WHERE THIS WHAT CAN HAPPEN?

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:23.840
IS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:25.408
GREATEST SUCCESS --

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:28.845
IN THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THOSE --

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.280
THE THE ONE WITH SOMETIMES THINK

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:32.849
ABOUT IN TERMS OF MASLOW

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.317
HIERARCHY OF NEEDS.

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.086
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.554
YOU LOOK AT THAT AT THE BASIC AT

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:38.788
THE BOTTOM LEVELS THERE'S JUST

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:39.956
BASIC.

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:43.360
BASIC NEEDS OF OUR FOOD SHELTER

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:45.562
WATER SAFETY.

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:46.897
YOU CAN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.365
MUCH ELSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:49.900
THOSE THINGS HANDLED.

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:51.368
N. AT THE HIGH SECURITY LEVEL

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:53.103
PRISONS AND THOSE THAT DON'T

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:55.338
HAVE A THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY.

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.274
THE THE THE MAIN FOCUS IS NOT

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.743
OUR SURVIVE TODAY.

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:00.710
A YOU CAN'T THINK BEYOND HOW TO

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:02.479
MY CHILDHOOD IMPACT MY DECISION

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.847
YOU DON'T GET TO THAT POINT.

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.248
SO -- YOU

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:05.949
GOTTA HAVE YOU GOTTA BE IN A

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:09.052
SAFE PLACE AND AND THAT TAKES.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:11.721
ON A SHARED AGREEMENT I THINK.

00:53:11.788 --> 00:53:14.090
AMONG THE PEOPLE INCARCERATED

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.659
AND THE STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION.

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.794
THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE.

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.362
FOR TO DO THIS WORK WE'RE NOT

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.697
JUST HERE TO WAREHOUSE

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:21.698
AND WE'RE NOT JUST HERE TO PUT

OURSELVES OUT.

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.471
AND I THINK WHERE YOU SEE THESE

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.640
THESE POCKETS EXIST LIKE THE SAN

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:30.907
QUENTIN'S.

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:33.877
THERE ARE MANY OF IT'S WHERE

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.678
THERE'S A SHARED AGREEMENT THIS

00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:35.912
IS THE WORK WE'RE HERE TO DO.

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.047

I'M.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.801
SO THAT THE WITHIN THOSE SPACES

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:58.401
THEY'RE ABLE TO EXPLORE THEIR

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:02.505

AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS --

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:12.682
IN ONE OF THE OTHER KEY PONENS

CAM COMPONENTS ARE JUST TOUCH

HAD AT THE HEAD SORT OF THE CITY

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.147

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:54.544
RESPONSE TO BEING CHALLENGED IN

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.546
SOME WAY IS TO USE VIOLENCE IT'S

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.681
NOT A MYSTERY HOW THAT HAPPENED.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.816

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:00.884
THEMSELVES.

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:01.785

OR OR STRESS THAT'S JUST ONE

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.758
EXAMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S ONE THAT

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:10.593
SHOWS UP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.227
SCENARIOS IN THE CASE THAT WE

RECIDIVISM RATE FOR PEOPLE WE

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.171
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.472

THE RASON --

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:06.709
WALKING OVER BACKGROUND MYSELF

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.711

THIS ONE FIVE YEARS TO LIFE --

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.717
THREE MONTHS AGO ON CHRISTMAS

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.586
EVE GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTING MY

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:17.487
SENTENCE.

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.554
I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE RECEIVED

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:19.789
THAT -- AND

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:21.324
FORTUNATELY SENATE BILL FOURTEEN

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.326
THIRTY SEVEN PASSED IN AUGUST

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:23.960
AND IN JANUARY WHEN INTO EFFECT.

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:27.397
WHICH RELEASED ME ON JANUARY.

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:28.631
SO I'VE BEEN --

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:29.966
I SERVE SIXTEEN YEARS AND I'VE

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.734
BEEN OUT TWO MONTHS NOW.

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:32.468
I'M THE REASON I'M HERE IS

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:35.772
BECAUSE I READ THE AUDIT.

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:37.240
A POWER THROUGH IT.

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:40.176
AND I SAW SOME.

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.210
ALSO A LOT OF THINGS IN THERE

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:41.844
THAT WERE LEFT OUT IN MY OPINION

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:43.246
BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.049
OF ATTENDING A LOT OF THE

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:48.051
PROGRAMS I'M ATTENDED MULTIPLE

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:50.320
SELF OGUZ REBUILT TO THE

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.255
PROGRAMS.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.156
AND THERE WAS ALSO A COUPLE OF

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:53.690
DISTINCTIONS.

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:54.524
IN MY OPINION THAT WERE

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.025
COMPLETELY LEFT OUT --

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.760
THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION

00:59:57.827 --> 01:00:00.263
GROUPS VERSES THE THE CDC ARE

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.865
RAN PROGRAMS --

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:03.433
IS A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:04.600
TALKS ABOUT.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.169
IN TERMS OF CULTURE AND WHAT

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.737
THAT MEANS FOR INCARCERATED

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.605
PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TRUST --

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.374
AND ALSO ANYTIME I BELIEVE WE'RE

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:14.610
TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM --

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.912
CAN'T MAKE RECIDIVISM RATES

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.213
UNLESS YOU TALK ABOUT --

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.349
AGAIN IN MY OPINION HOUSING AND

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.850
EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:21.918
THOSE THE TWO HIGHEST.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.753
REASONS WHY PEOPLE COME BACK

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.387
FROM LAST ONE OF THE STUDIES ARE

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.323
READY SAID.82% OF INCARCERATED

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.890
PEOPLE COME BACK WITHIN THE

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.292
FIRST YEAR.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.827
DIRECTLY LINKED TO HOUSING AND

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.929
EMPLOYMENT.

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.230
AND SO WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.665
LINKED TO THOSE POOR CBT

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.767
PROGRAMS COGNITIVE OR THERAPY

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.036
PROGRAMS.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:43.773
EVER BEEN A SET IN THE AUDIT.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.374
I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS FAILED.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.541
IN.

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.943
I HAVE I CAN SPEAK A LOT MORE ON

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.879
THAT BUT I THINK --

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.180
ARE OPEN TO QUESTIONS THE

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:53.182
MEASURE ACTUALLY WORKS

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:53.483
[inaudible]

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.350
I'M.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.352
SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:59.655
PARTICIPATED IN.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.724
A VARIETY OF WHAT CDC ARE

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:02.825
CONSIDERED TO BE REHABILITATIVE

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:05.094
PROGRAMS CAN YOU JUST SHARE SOME

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:10.533
PERSPECTIVES ON THAT --

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.268
AGAIN KNOWING THAT THIS IS.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.705
YOU'RE SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:18.608
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:19.409
I THINK --

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.710
WHEN I WANT TO START WITH --

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.445
WE TALK ABOUT.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:23.813
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY I

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.747
THINK WHAT IT DOES WHAT

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.983
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.650
I'M NOT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.519
A RIGHT OR WRONG WAY BUT I THINK

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:32.722
WHAT IT DOES IS IS AND PRESSES --

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:37.460
THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM MEANING --

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.127
OKAY WHY AM I THINKING LIKE AS I

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.762
HEARD THAT I'M CRIMINAL THINKING

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:42.065
CRIMINAL THINKING A LOT AND IT

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.600
KIND OF MADE ME.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:45.134
THINK LIKE WHAT DOES THAT

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.536
ACTUALLY MEAN AM I SUPPOSED TO

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.303
STOP.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.406
THINKING CRIM CRIMINALLY NOW --

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.675
AND AND OVERCOME THAT QUOTE

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:53.609
UNQUOTE ISSUE THAT'S WITHIN ME.

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:56.779
AND A REALLY IN TERMS OF

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.482
UNDERSTANDING TRAUMA AND PAIN

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.016
AND HOW.

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.118
EXAMPLE I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE IS

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.153
I WENT FROM MY EIGHT YEAR OLD

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.855
LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. EIGHTEEN

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.390
YEAR OLD WITH A LIFE SENTENCE.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.791
AND SO HOW CAN COGNITIVE

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.827
BEHAVIOR THERAPY IN THAT MOMENT

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.562
HELP ME I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.996
FOR ME IT WOULD WHAT HELPED ME

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.231
WAS REALLY GOING BACK

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:16.666
UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT YEAR OLD

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.234
ME WHEN MY PARENTS DIVORCE AND

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:19.936
THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT WAS

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.737
DEVELOPED OVER TIME.

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:22.939
YES I COMMITTED MY CRIME AT THE

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.474
AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND I MADE A

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.308
CONSCIOUS CHOICE THAT DAY THAT

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.009
NIGHT.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.278
HOWEVER MY ABANDONMENT FROM

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:30.546
EIGHT YEARS OLD MY EXPERIENCES

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.215
OF NEGLECT AND ABANDONMENT AT

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.549
TWELVE YEARS OLD.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.384
MY HOMELESSNESS A SEVENTEEN YEAR

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:37.186
OLD WHICH REINFORCED NOT THIS

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.287
PHYSICAL STRUCTURE ON HAVE A

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.255
PLACE TO STAY BUT THE

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:42.091
REINFORCEMENT OF YOU DON'T

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:43.259
MATTER YOU DON'T CARE.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.260
THE NEED.

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.195
FOR A FATHER FIGURE WHO WAS

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.697
ABSENT IN MY LIFE THE AGAIN

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:50.867
AMANDA MANY LIKE THOSE THINGS

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.401
AREN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESSED AND

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:53.002
ADDRESS AT THE ROOT OF WHERE

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.903
THEY HAVE BEEN.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.470
AND SO WHEN I STARTED TAKING

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.072
THESE --

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.773
PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALSO

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.876
COMMUNITY BASED BRAND WHICH IS

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.911
VERY VERY IMPORTANT MY OPINION.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.313
BECAUSE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.681
THERE'S A HUGE BUST.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:08.484
THE FOR ME AND FOR MANY MEN AND

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:09.785
WOMEN IN SADDAM'S ONLY FOR WOMEN

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.187
OR MEN MANY OTHER FRIENDS THAT

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.522
ARE SPOKEN TO INSIDE.

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.090
LOT OF TIMES WE DID NOT FEEL

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.091
LIKE WE WERE EVER PART OF

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.126
SOCIETY OR COMMUNITY TO BEGIN

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:17.894
WITH -- I

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.028
STRUGGLE AT HOME WITH WITH

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:21.230
ISSUES I WENT TO SCHOOL ANDYES

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.232
MY BEHAVIOR SHOWED UP IN SCHOOL

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.800
BUT I WAS CONSIDERED A QUOTE

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:25.201
UNQUOTE BAD IT.

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.602
AND SALAS TAKEN OUT OF THE

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.504
CLASSROOM PUT IN DETENTION OR

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.339
SUSPENSION WE'RE LITERALLY MY

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.607
FUTURE DEPENDENT ON ME BEING IN

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:32.141
THE CLASSROOM.

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.143
AND SO WHAT I WAS OBSERVED AS IS

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.312
AN ACADEMIC FAILURE.

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:39.549
AND MY EMOTIONAL --

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.318
ARMS WERE NEVER DEALT WITH THAT

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.854
EIGHT NINE ON I STILL NEVER FELT

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.922
LIKE OKAY I DON'T BELONG AT HOME

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.323
I DON'T BELONG IN SCHOOL.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.990
I WAS KICKED OUT OF HOME NOW TO

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:48.991
BELONG IN SOCIETY AND SO

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.760
THEREFORE AT LEAST LIKE A

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.728
LOGICALLY --

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:53.362
SOCIETY RULES NO LONGER APPLY TO

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.931
ME.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:56.666
AND THERE ARE GOING TO COMMIT

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:57.333
MORE CRIMES.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.935
AND COMING INTO PRISON THERE IS

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.270
A HUGE CULTURE OF IS ABUSIVE

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.706
CULTURE OF POWER AND CONTROL IS

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.440
ACTUALLY.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.441
HOT FOR THE CORRECTIONAL

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.010
OFFICERS IT'S TIED TO PAID STAFF

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.580
THAT OVERSEE THE PRISON PROGRAMS.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.381
LIKE IF YOU GUYS SIT IN THE

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.015
TRAINING HONOR SENATE TRAINING

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:13.282
BUT JUST.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.251
KNOWING HEARING ABOUT IT SITTING

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.619
IN THE TRAINING IT'S THE

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.954
MANIPULATORS THEY'RE GONNA TRY

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.989
TO DO THIS YOU DON'T GIVEN THIS

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:22.892
DON'T GIVEN THAT TREAT HIM LIKE

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.794
THAT THAT THERE.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.728
THEY'RE TAUGHT WITH ABUSE AND

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.897
CONTROL IS IS THE IS THE WAY TO

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:28.998
FUNCTION AND DEAL WITH HUMAN

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:29.966
BEINGS -- EN

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:30.967
EN.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:31.968
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.502
WANT TO SAY DO NOT DO THAT.

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:34.837
IT IN THE AUDIT IT WAS CLEAR TO

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.272
ME RIGHT WHEN I READ IT IS SAID

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.441
THAT SANK NGUYEN HAD THE LOWEST.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.776
CAMINO A CVT ENROLLMENT RATE

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.345
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.113
ENROLLMENT RIGHT.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.014
THAT'S BECAUSE IN IN SEGUIN THE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.984
LAST FOUR YEARS I SPENT THERE.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.385
THIS IS SO HUGE ON COMMUNITY.

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.786
MAYBE IS THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:52.388
IS STRUCTURED AND IN THE MIDDLE

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.789
MARIN QUOTE UNQUOTE LIBERAL BAY

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.890
AREA I DON'T KNOW BUT IT HAS

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:57.560
ACCESS TO PEOPLE --

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.028
AND SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING IN

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.830
THERE THEY WERE BRINGING THEIR

01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:01.631
PROGRAMS WITH THEM.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.766
SO LOT A LOT OF THE MEN INSIDE

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.268
WERE LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO SEE

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.370
THE PROGRAM WHERE.

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:08.504
IT'S A PAID CDC OUR STAFF.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.939
AND THERE'S NO TRUST THERE I'M

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:12.174
GOING TO WEAR WE'RE JUST

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:12.808
COMMUNITY WHERE I FEEL LIKE I'M

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:15.778
LAW -- IN

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:16.379
THEIR MIND IN THEIR HEART AND

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.848
SOUL IF I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPECTED.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.916
TO SIT IN A PROGRAM.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:21.917
WELL SUPPOSED TO SHARE MY

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:26.088
INNERMOST JAMES TRAUMAS HAYNES.

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.823
A HERTZ WHATEVER THAT MAY BE.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:28.758
BUT I DON'T TRUST THE PERSON I'M

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:29.659
SAYING THAT TO THE WORK IS NOT

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.093
GOING TO BE DONE.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.595
INTERNALLY IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:33.229
DONE.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.597
BUT IF I'M SITTING IN A IN A

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.766
CULTURE IN A IN A IN A CLASSROOM.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.100
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE PERSON I'M

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.169
AND THE PEOPLE I'M SPEAKING.

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:42.271
TO I TRUST THEM THEY HERE FOR MY

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:45.474
INTEREST THE NOT SEAT CDC ARE OR

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.310
OR ENOUGH FROM PORTABLE THE MAN.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:49.745
THAT I I BELIEVE I CAN REALLY

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.547
SPEAK ABOUT MY MY TRAUMAS AND

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.450
FIND HEALING.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.752
ALSO A LOT OF THE CBC PROGRAMS

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.688
DID NOT ADDRESS VICTIM IMPACT.

01:05:58.754 --> 01:05:59.588
TO A DEGREE THAT I FEEL LIKE

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:00.956
IT'S IMPORTANT OUR ORGANIZATION

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.291
RESTORED IT JUST RESTORE JUSTICE.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.526
UNDER OU STAFF WE HAVE

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.593
SURVIVORS OF CRIME PEOPLE WHO

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.395
HAVE LOST LOVED ONES TO VIOLENCE.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.197
WORKING ALONGSIDE WITH PEOPLE

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:11.133
WHO HAVE COMMITTED HARM.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:11.901
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HEALING MEANS

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.736
WERE BOTH SIDES INDIVIDUALLY AND

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.838
COLLECTIVELY AND THAT THAT WAS

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:18.240
LACKING IN MY OPINION IN THE CBC

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:18.507
PROGRAMS.

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:21.277
ON SO SO THAT IS ANOTHER THING I

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:21.877
THINK CULTURE HAS A LOT TO DO

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.946
WITH IT --

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.314
IS IS I CAN GO INSIDE A

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.716
CLASSROOM SURE I CAN BE IN A

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.217
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.353
GROUP WAS SOON AS I STEP OUT I'M

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.355
BEING TOLD TO GET OVER HERE GO

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:34.457
THERE SHUT UP SIT DOWN.

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.025
ABUSIVE LANGUAGE CONTROLLING

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.426
LANGUAGE AND IT'S KIND OF

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.228
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE --

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.230
AN EXAMPLE LIKE TO USE I DON'T

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.398
WANT TO OFFEND ANYONE ELSE IN

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.265
THE MILITARY BUT SOMEBODY IS

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.835
SUFFERING FROM PTSD WOULD YOU

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:48.170
PUT HIM IN A PUNITIVE CULTURE.

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.206
TO HELP HELP THEM OVERCOME PTSD.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:51.173
MANY MEN AND WOMEN IN PRISON

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.075
SUFFER FROM PTSD.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.211
WAR ZONES MAYBE WITHIN THE HOME

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:55.945
COMMUNITY --

WILLING TO CONTINUE THAT.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:46.061
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT OPENNESS

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:46.862
TO THE COMMUNITY.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.030
A CULTURE WITHIN THE PRISON

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.099
PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.200
TRANSFERRED IN FROM OTHER

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:52.367
PRISONS.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.550
HERE.

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:09.818
AND IT BLOWS THE MIND.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.453
IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THIS

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.756
DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT IT THIS.

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:16.725

[inaudible]

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.194
GREAT.

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.796
BUT SAN QUENTIN HAS CREATED AN

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:21.330
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.898
THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT ON ALL

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:23.499
SIDES THIS IS THE WORK WE'RE

HERE TO DO.

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:25.634
AND THAT TAKES A COMMITMENT FROM

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.970
THE WAR LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:29.772
N..

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.173
BOTH SUPPORTING AND AND

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.877
REWARDING STAFF TO SUPPORT THAT.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:35.511
AND DISCIPLINE THOSE WHO DON'T.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:54.089
TO THE CULTURE OF OFFICERS --

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:54.456
IN MY OPINION.

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:57.926

USE OF AUTHORITY.

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:14.142
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.977
BEGINNINGS --

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.011
AND THEN NOTHING LIKE YOU JUST

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:16.745
MENTIONED THAT THE COMMUNITY

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:18.313
BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.548
ATTRACTED BECAUSE THEY'LL BE

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.316
MORE INCLUDES INCLUDED.

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:23.285
INTO THESE PRISONS --

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.254
Là TIME THERE'S THIS DIVISION

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.490
OF IN MEAT LOVERS ALL THE TERM

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.726
GOING AROUND.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.026
YOU KNOW --

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.028
KNOWN.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.230

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:35.898
THE I'M NOT I WON'T USE HERE BUT

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:37.432

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.001
AND SUCH AND SO IT IT'S IT'S

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.736
MORE THESE DEMORALIZING --

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.404
AND THEN THE THE THE TROUBLE IT

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.106
TAKES FROM VOLUNTEERS OR COMMUNE

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.073
BASED ORGANIZATION TO GET IN A

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:45.707
PRISON.

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.709
IS CONSTANTLY OUR TURN AROUND

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:49.344
YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS EVEN

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:49.945
THOUGH THAT PERSON PUT IT A

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.314
WARRANT THE SAME THING THE WEEK

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.284
BEFORE I'M IT IS IS IT SEEMS

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.852
LIKE THEIR GAMES --

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.387
AN IS REALLY DEMORALIZING THEY

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:00.422
CAN BE AND SO THAT CULTURE I

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:01.990
BELIEVE NEEDS TO CHANGE --

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.058
WORK MANY VETS ORGANIZATIONS CAN

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:10.499
COME IN INTO THE PRISON AND WORK

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.133
COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE PEOPLE

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:13.235
INSIDE -- I

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:13.936
THINK.

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.671
IT IS ALSO CLEAR IN THE IN THE

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.707
AUDIT WHERE TO TALK ABOUT SAID

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.742
AS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:21.843
ANY FACILITY CORCORAN THEY TALK

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.813
ABOUT THE RECIDIVISM RATES FOR

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.148
THE INCARCERATED MEN AND BY THAT

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:29.618
PROGRAM THAT THEY EVALUATED WAS

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:33.288
LOWER AND I'M GONNA ASK A

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.157
QUESTION NEXT ABOUT SUBSTANCE

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.024
ABUSE.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.727
AND SO SO IN THAT FACILITY.

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.295
THERE'S AN OFFICER THAT WAS

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.196
QUOTED BY SAYING THAT I AN

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:41.997
OPPOSITE SAID THE I BELIEVE THE

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.665
REASON WHY THAT IS BECAUSE OF

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:46.201
THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.769
THAT IS OFFICER SAYING THAT IN

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:50.439
THE AUDIT AND SO.

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:51.506
I THINK THAT --

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.308
NOTHING I WAS ONE ADD BRIEFLY IS

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:56.611
WITH ME BASS ORGANIZATIONS IF

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:57.446
YOU TALK ABOUT MAKING.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:17:01.316
A CHANGE THE CULTURE --

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.851
AND LINKING IT TO RE ENTRY.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.486
THE REASON I AM I FEEL LIKE I'M

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:07.189
SUCCESSFUL AND I'M SET UP TO BE

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:08.023
SUCCESSFUL ON MURRAY ENTRY IS

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:09.658
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY BASED

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.625
ORGANIZATIONS HELPED ME.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:15.831
THROUGH AND THROUGH THE DAY

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.165
AFTER THE THEIR DAY OF ON ME

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.467
THAT I GOT OUT.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:22.037
THAT LINKAGE OF RE ENTRY IS NOT

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:24.239
THERE WHEN IT COMES TO NOT IN MY

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.874
OPINION NOT COMING BACK.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.142
AND SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.810
PROPOSE OR JUST.

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:29.578
PUT OUT THERE THE PEOPLE ARE

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:30.312
LISTENING.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.247
IS THAT MANY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:35.450
NEED TO BE AT THE CENTER OF

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.051
WHATEVER THIS CULTURE SHIFT IS

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:36.885

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.600
I HAD A WE WE DISCUSSED IN THE

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.068
LAST FEW WEEKS HERE IN THIS

SUBSTANCE ABUSE CULTURE?

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.746
INSIDE THE PRISONS.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:38.914

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING?

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.086
UPPER IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:48.290
DOLLARS. FOR THE MEDICAL STUFF

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:50.292
THAT WE NEED TO PUT INTO THOSE

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:51.193
WHAT I'D LOSE WHAT'S YOUR

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:54.329
OPINION I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE --

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.464
EXPLORING.

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:57.332
ALL THE DIFFERENT.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.367
NOW THESE AND AND SUBSTANCE

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:01.069
ABUSE TREATMENT --

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.638
UP TO NOW IT HAS BEEN --

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.107
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS NARCOTICS

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:08.910
ANONYMOUS YEAH WELL STEP YEAH.

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:09.544
WHICH DOESN'T WORK FOR A LOT OF

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:10.479
PEOPLE --

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:12.848
BUT IT IS SORT OF THE FAVORED.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:16.118
APPROACH ON AND WHAT I FOUND

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.452
AGAIN.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.421
LOOKING AT AT IT THROUGH THE

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.689
PAROLE BOARD LENS.

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:23.325
IT IS BECAUSE IT'S A FAMILIAR

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.227
ENOUGH MODEL TO ROLL COMMISSION.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:29.164
IF THEY CAN THEY CAN TRACK --

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:30.765
TRACK IT AS A STRUCTURED

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.334
APPROACH TO RECOVERY AND

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.169
SOBRIETY --

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:34.836
TWELVE STEPS OKAY WOULD YOU WORK

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.938
TWELVE STEPS AND YOU CAN SHOW

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.673
THAT YOU HAVE A CLEAN UP RECORD

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.175
BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN PRISON.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:40.742
THEN YOU'VE YOU'VE ADDRESSED

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:42.878
THAT ISSUE.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:43.478
BUT IT DOES THAT DOESN'T WORK

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:44.546
THE WAY FOR EVERYBODY.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.380
AND SO THERE'S SOME OTHER

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.681
STRUCTURED WAY SOMEONE'S GOTTEN

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:49.284
CLEARLY MAINTAIN SOBRIETY.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.685
RATE MOST --

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:51.520
AND THEN.

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:53.088
THEY SAY THE THREE THINGS WOULD

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.022
BE THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.724
TREATMENT.

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:58.093
OUR NUMBER HERE ABLE SERBIAN

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:58.460
TWELVE STEP SO.

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.662
THE YEAH I KNOW IT IN WE'RE

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:03.431
LOOKING AT THIS AUDIT IS IS.

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:06.401
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.702
YOU KNOW MAYBE.

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.404
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT DIRECTION

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.073
BUT I I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.808
IT'S DONE RIGHT THE THAT'S WHAT

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.609
I WOULD.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.577
I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY THOSE

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.414
THINGS ARE [inaudible]

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.383
I KNOW [inaudible]

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:27.055
PERSONALLY THAT --

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:29.124
MY SISTER BECAME A DRUG ADDICT

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.134
BIGGER THING IS CHANGING THE

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.302
CULTURE OF THE LEARNING

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:29.904
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:32.206
TRULY TRULY FEEL SAFE. TO TALK

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:33.708

COMMITTEE.

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.631
MY SECOND QUESTION IS.

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:11.332
IN.

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.767

JUST RECAP THAT ARM.

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.332
I WOULD SAY THAT THERE HAS TO BE

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:47.535

ON THE OUTSIDE.

01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:57.278
THAT IS NOT OVERLY RESTRICTIVE

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:57.912
THAT IS NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE

01:36:57.978 --> 01:36:59.246
PRISON.

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.482
OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.084
EXIST NON FOR FOCUSING ON

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.886

TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:21.135
MONTHS OR A TWO YEAR.

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.469
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE VERY

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:23.938
RESTRICTIVE --

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.172
MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY

INTEGRATE WITH.

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:49.230

SUCH A KEY ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:08.449
WE NEED TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO

WE HAD ALL OF THEM IN THE

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.200
PROGRAM.

WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:44.872
THEM.

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:46.440
AND THAT INVOLVES FORMING CARS

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.809
REALLY PEOPLE INVOLVES TRAINING

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.289
THEY CREATE.

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:04.525
MORE THESE THESE THESE POCKETS

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:07.027
THESE OF THESE PLACES WHERE THEY

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:09.363
CAN REPLACE THE THE THE CYCLES

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.931
OF VIOLENCE THAT WE STAND WITH I

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:11.765
WOULD.

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:13.734
CALL IT CYCLES OF VIRTUE.

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:14.301
