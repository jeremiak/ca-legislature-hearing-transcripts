I THE AUDIT REQUEST FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND REHABILITATION. NOBODY WANTED TO SIT NEXT TO ME WHAT WAS WRONG MORE PHOTOGENIC. NO NO. I WARNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS HARDING. MY COLLEAGUE AND I ASSEMBLY MEMBER IAN CALDERON UMP RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT THE STATE AUDITOR CONDUCT AN AUDIT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND REBUILT REHABILITATION'S CDC ARE. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS HOUSE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INMATES ANNUALLY. AND RELEASES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OFFENDERS BACK INTO COMMUNITIES EACH YEAR. VARIOUS IMPRISONED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OFFERED TO INMATES TO IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL LEAD A PRODUCTIVE CRIME FREE LIFE UPON RELEASE OR. READ BRICK BUT AREN'T AND NOT TO RECEIVE A. AS CHAIR OF SUB FIVE FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN. I'M I WAS ABLE TO PUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET FOR REHABILITATION AND REENTRY PROGRAMS. SINCE THAT TIME I'VE ASKED FOR A REPORT ON HOW THE MONEY WAS USED. I'M YET TO RECEIVE. A REPORT. GIVEN THE KIND OF INVESTMENT THAT WE WILL BE MAKING THROUGH TO VARIOUS PROPOSITIONS ON 47-57 AND OTHERS WHICH COULD LEAD INTO BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARM. DISCOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IN HIS PROGRAM IT IS NATURAL THAT WE IT'S A STATE NEED TO EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. AND OF PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY. BOB I AM A BIG BIG PROPONENT OF EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AUDIT IS NOT ONLY PROVE THAT IT WORKS BUT ALSO TO SHOW HOW WE CAN IMPROVE AND MAKE SURE. THAT THE MONIES THAT WE SPEND ON IN THE NEXT. OUR HOPE THE NEXT DECADE. ARE SPENT EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. WE USUALLY SPEND THE MONEY. AND THAT WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SUBMITTED THIS IS GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TERM IN THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED SO THAT WE GET THE MOST THE BEST OUTCOME. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK A GUY VOTE. AND MY COLLEAGUE IS HERE WITH ME TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OFFERS INMATES VARIOUS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON. INCLUDING EDUCATION AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAMS THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THESE PROGRAMS IS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. TO EXTEND OUR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE THE PROGRAMS HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM THE CDC ARE SHOULD BE COMMENDED HOWEVER IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO LA AND REPORT THE ALEJO IDENTIFIED SEVERAL. SHORTCOMINGS IN IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CDC OURS VARIOUS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT COULD LIMIT THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM SUCCESS. FIRST IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER EACH PROGRAM IS READ RESEARCH BASED AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE MODEL PROGRAM SECOND REHABILITATION SLOT TO DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ALLOCATED OR USED EFFECTIVELY. TO MEET IN MAY NEEDS FINALLY THE REPORT NOTES THAT CDC ARE USES. LOTT APPROACHES FOR MEASURING PROGRAM PERFORMANCE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER EXISTING PROGRAM RESOURCES ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY PRIOR TO PURSUING ANY LEGISLATION RECOMMENDING CHANGES. TO ANY IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE BELIEVE AN AUDIT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND CDC OURS. PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AS THE STATE PRIORITIZE AND INCREASES FUNDING FOR REPLAYABILITY ASIAN PROGRAMS BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT STATE FUNDS ARE BEING USED. AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE WE SIMPLY NEED MORE INFORMATION BEFORE DISCUSSING FUNDING LEVELS OR ANY LEGISLATIVE FIXES TO SEE YOU SEE OURS INCREASE PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE BELIEVE THIS AUDIT WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH. INFORMATION TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ON THESE PROGRAMS ESSENTIALLY WE SPENT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT ISN'T WORKING. I BELIEVE IN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS ARE ALSO THE SAME TIME THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NOT PROGRAMS FOCUSED. WITH ARTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HELP OTHERS. WITHIN THE SYSTEM. REHABILITATING KEEP THEM FROM RECEIPT OF AIDING A BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE OUR MONEY. AYE EFFECTIVELY ARE MONIES BEING USED IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR US. THEN WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME. TO DO THAT AND TO LEARN THAT AND UNDERSTAND IT SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND WE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH STATE ORDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS AS A ASSEMBLYMEMBERS INDICATED THIS WOULD BE IN OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. STARTING OUT BY LOOKING AT THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THEIR OVERSIGHT OVER THESE PAST STATE FUNDED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THAT A FEW KEY ISSUES AS THE MEMBERS INDICATED IN THERE AND THEY'RE OPENING COMMENTS AS. HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REALLY DETERMINE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO MEET THE REHABILITATION NEEDS OF INMATES STARTING SPECIFICALLY WITH HOW DID THEY ESTABLISH THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS ARE THE PROGRAMS EVIDENCE BASED. WHAT'S THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR THOSE VARIOUS PROGRAMS HOW'RE THEY EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS MONITORING AND PROGRESS. AND ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH PROGRAMS WHAT TYPE OF DATA ARE THEY MAINTAINING OR COLLECTING WITH RESPECT TO ENROLLMENT OF PROGRAMS ATTENDANCE. OUTCOMES SUCCESS. FOR THE INMATES. WHETHER OR NOT THE INMATES RISK IN THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS ARE BEING MET HOW WHAT TOOLS ARE THEY USING TO FIRST IDENTIFY WHAT THE NEEDS ARE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL INMATES HAVE. AND HOW DO THEY DETERMINE WHICH PROGRAMS TO ENROLL THOSE INMATES AND AND THEN TO ISSUES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE METRICS HOW'RE THEY ASSESSING WHAT METRICS ARE THEY USING TO ASSESS. AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS AND THEN PERHAPS MAKE SOME. CHANGES TO A PARTICULAR PROGRAMS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT THEY DIDN'T MENTION IN THEIR COMMENTS IS DETERMINING WHETHER THERE'S A WAITLIST. IF THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS ON A WAITING LIST HOW HOW MANY HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN ON THAT LIST WHAT IT NEEDS OF THOSE PARTICULAR INMATES ONE OF THE ISSUES. THAT LA O. MENTIONED WAS. WHERE THEY HAVE THAT? EFFECTIVENESS OF PARTICULAR PROGRAMS IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF INMATES THAT ARE HIGH VERY HIGH RISK AND HAVE VERY VERY HIGH NEED SO IN LOOKING AT THAT WAITING LIST ARE ARE WE SEEING INMATES ON THAT LIST. THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE PLACED INTO PROGRAMS SO. THE AUDIT TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED HOURS WILL BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AS WITH ANY AUDIT IF WE FEEL WE NEED TO BRING IN EXPERTISE TO ASSIST US WE WILL WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WE THINK WE CAN HANDLE MOST OF THESE. REQUESTS THAT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS MEMBERS ASKED OUT WITH OUR OWN STAFF A TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED OUR AUDIT WILL TAKE US ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OF STAFF TIME TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BACK VERY MUCH. THE AUTHORS OR THE REQUEST YEARS OF THE AUDIT. DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF YOUR PRESENTATION. NO OKAY LARRY. LIKE TO INVITE THEN. THE. RESPONDING AGENCY. BELIEVE WE HAVE CHRIS APPLEGATE ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ALSO LEGISLATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION. GOOD MORNING HERE IN MEMBERS ABOUT CHRIS APPLEGATE ON THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AS I REQUEST NOTES AND BOTH MEMBERS OF NOTED THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE HAVE I MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING SO OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THIS VARIES FROM COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY CT PROGRAMS LONG TERM OFFENDER PROGRAMS THAT THREE TWO INNOVATIVE GRANT PROGRAMS NOT SOME CORRECTIONS PROGRAMS. THESE HAVE BEEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. WE THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF AND I WERE HAPPY TO COOPERATE WITH THE ON IT. HOWEVER WE. THINK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE RELATED TO BILL APPLEGATE OF TORRANCE I AM NOT. YEAH. YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD OR BAD OKAY. MIGHT BE A VOTE. ALL RIGHT. OUR. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER ABOUT THIS THOUGH. AS. AS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE. BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY I STRONGLY SUPPORT THEIR AUDIT I'M. HAPPY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO. PRESENTERS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND. I HOPE THAT. PRODUCTIVE. IMPROVEMENTS CAN RESULT FROM THAT SO. I THINK THAT. ONE AREA WHICH SUGGESTS THE JUSTICE THAT GO INTO IT DESERVE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. PAROLE PROGRAMS AND. WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM AFTER? THEY LEAVE PAROLE AND ARE. HEADED OFF TO YOUR COUNTY. MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AND THEN THE ISSUE OF WHERE THEY GO OR THEY HOME BECOME HOMELESS HOUSING. SERVE THE. SIR THE HANDOFF BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND. THE. COUNTY I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT. AREA. I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION OR DOES THIS INCLUDE. THE. YOUTH. A JUVENILE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTION RESISTANT DOOR. IT'S ONLY. IT'S ONLY BE ADULT BY COULD. WE JUST PAYS ONLY TELLS YOU ALL OKAY SO I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ONE OR THE OTHER. SO IT'S WE'RE TALKING TO DOLE. OKAY OKAY THAT'S GOOD OKAY. I. I THINK DID DO. YOU KNOW THE RECEIVER. HAS MANAGED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS YOU KNOW WITH A COURT ORDER. THE RECEIVER HAS. DONE SOME THINGS THAT. NONE OF US WOULD HAVE DONE. IN TERMS OF DIRECTING LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH. AND OTHER ASPECTS AND I THINK. WHAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE TRANSFERRING? THE RESPONSIBILITY BACK. TO. THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE AWAY FROM THE RECEIVER. AND SOME OF THOSE I JUST POINT OUT ONE THING THAT I'VE ALWAYS BROUGHT UP. THE RECEIVER THE MENTAL HEALTH. COURT CASE. THE CLIENT TO INCLUDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AND THEN THEN AND THE RECEIVERS OF RESPONSIBILITIES. THE OTHER WORDS THEY. HOODED MENTAL HEALTH. BUT THE CLIENT TO INCLUDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TREATMENT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THEY HAD MENTAL HEALTH. WITHOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WHICH IS ILLOGICAL. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THAT HUESO NOW THE DEPARTMENT'S TRYING TO. CATCH UP TO THE BUDGET. REDUCTIONS. IN ALL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAPPENED AND. FIVE SIX YEARS AGO. WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP. WE HAVE A SEVERE EGGMAN PROBLEM OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE. THE DEATHS IN THE PRISON FROM FENTON ALL AND OTHER DRUG ABUSE PROBLEMS. SO IT'S BECOME A MAJOR. ISSUE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SO APPRECIATE THAT I JUST HAD THOSE COMMENTS TO MAKE. YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE WAS NOT. EMPHASIZED BY THE FEDERAL COURT RECEIVER. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE. COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE AT THIS TIME I. SEE WE HAVE A QUORUM OF SENATORS WE NOW NEED A QUORUM OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS WELCOME REMEMBER BAKER. YEAH. PUBLIC COMMENTS ANY COMMENTS ON THIS AUDIT REQUEST PLEASE COME FOR. I'M TELLING ROTH AUDEN FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND. IN USUALLY WITH A C. S. SUPPORTING ON US LIKE THIS BECAUSE IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD A FAIRLY ROCKY RELATIONSHIP. BUT I'M HERE WITHOUT GUILE TO BASICALLY SAY THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AYE THIS DEPARTMENT HAS REALLY STEPPED FORWARD PARTICULARLY THEIR REHABILITATION SECTION. THEY'VE REHIRED MANY OF THE TEACHERS THEY'VE TAKEN MANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE UNION PUT FORWARD AND DR CHOATE WHO'S RUNNING THE REHABILITATION IS REALLY UNINSPIRED LEADER. IN SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE OPPOSE THE IDEA THAT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO REWARD. PEOPLE OVER AND CDC ARE THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HAVE MADE A GREAT DEAL OF PROGRESS. WE'VE SEEN AND IT'S NOT JUST. RECIDIVISM WILL NOT JUST BE. WHAT HAPPENS IN REHABILITATION WILL NOT BE THE ONLY INPUT TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM? WE'VE SEEN THE RATE OF RETURN TO PRISON GO FROM SIXTY SIX TO PERCENT TO TWENTY TWO PERCENT. WE THINK THAT'S AWESOME WE THINK THAT THERE THE FORTY SIX PERCENT. IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE OVER SIXTY PERCENT RATE THAT WE HAD BEFORE IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM SO THEY ARE DOING A DECENT JOB THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO SAY WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS AUDIT BECAUSE WE THINK WE NEED TO READ MORE THOSE PUBLIC SERVANTS THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE OVER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION. THANK YOU. MICHAEL GO WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION I JUST LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF A IT'S YEAH LOOK ONE THOUSAND WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS BUT. ALSO SEE MY HANDS THERE'S. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER. PUBLIC COMMENTS. I'D LIKE TO. DRIVE FIRST ADDRESS THE QUESTION WELL WHAT WHEN WE GIVE THE RIGHT WILL REQUEST AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO. CONCERNS RIGHT REYES BY ASCII. SO. BUT THAT SOMEONE. WHOSE JOB BEEN TO A LOT OF ROCKY. ON AUDITS Y. WERE FOR THE CITY OF INTO SEVERAL. ON I'VE BEEN IN SOMEWHERE. DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS DD AUDITOR LEFT CRYING. AND I. I WHEN I SEE CONTENTIOUS VERY CONTENTIOUS SADDAM. SO NUMBER ONE I'M GLAD THAT CDC ARE IS WILLING PARTICIPANT IN THIS BECAUSE THIS IS RE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR THEM ARM FOR BOTH PARTIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE ANSWERS. MY COLLEAGUE AND I WILL BE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT MY UNION SEIU IS TALKING ABOUT. WHENEVER WE ASK WHENEVER PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS. ASK ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS. I'M WE SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET NUMBERS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT WE DON'T GIVE THOSE. I BELIEVE THIS AUDIT WILL NOT ONLY HIGHLIGHT ON HIM SOME AREAS WE CAN IMPROVE. AND I DON'T USE THE WORD WRONG OR PROBLEMS BUT AREAS WE CAN IMPROVE. BUT I ALSO THINK WILL HIGHLIGHT UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESSES IN AREAS THAT WE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT. LIKE I THINK YOU MENTIONED. WAS THE ACTORS GANG I'M I DON'T KNOW OF ROCK CLIMBING WORKS AND IMPRISONS BUT WHAT IF IT DOES. HOPEFULLY THIS AUDIT WAS SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SHOW HOW WE CAN. WE CAN DOCUMENT. BOMB THEM. EFFECTIVENESS OF IT I AM I ASKED ABOUT A JOB PROGRAM WHEN SOMEONE GETS A JOB LEAD TO TRADE AND THEN LEAVES I ASKED WHETHER NOT THEY KEPT. ON THE JOB FOR A LONG TIME AND MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF GETTING THAT DATA. I DON'T THINK THEY. THEY WORKED HARD ENOUGH TO GET THAT DATA BECAUSE DETAILS SAFE YOU IF YOU WOULD CALL. THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE A TREASURE LAW OFFICERS IN THE STATE AND GET THEIR THAT THEY PAID STATE TAXES FOR THE LAST. FIVE YEARS WELL GUESS WHAT I'M PRETTY SURE GOING TO WORK NINE TO FIVE EVERYDAY DONE LEGAL WHOLE LOTTA ROOM ROOM FOR HIM TO RECEIVE A. AND SO YOU HAVE A SUCCESS STORY RIGHT THERE BUT WE'RE NOT DOCUMENTED. AND AND I LOOK AT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW HOW NOT ONLY HOW EFFECTIVE THESE PROGRAMS ARE BUT I'M HOPING THAT ALSO SHOWED. NADIA DEDICATED EMPLOYEES THAT WORK ON THIS EVERY DAY. ON THAT THAT THAT WOULD WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT AND AND FINALLY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE AUDITOR KNOWS I WANTED. HER TO LOOK AT AND UP WHO IF YOU HIRE SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION A UNIQUE. PLACE TO WORK WHERE YOU COULD HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION CALL UP PROGRAM. AND SOMEONE. MY DISTRICT PRISON GANG LEADER OR SHOCK COLLAR MAY WANT TO BE SHUT DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN TO FIGHT. THERE'S PROBLEMS AND ALISON THE NUMBERS WHO ARE DOING VERY WELL GOAL DRAMATICALLY DOWN. BUT IT'S NOT. SHOULD NOT BE A REFLECTION ON THE PROGRAM SHABBY REFLECTION ON ON VIA THE DIRECTOR WHO'S DOING IT SHOULD BE IN A BAD REFLECTION ON CD IT SEE OUR AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOCUMENT THAT. THESE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE THAT WE WHO'VE NEVER BEEN IN THANK GOD WOULD NEVER BEEN IN THAT SITUATION. ON BAKED A DAY EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES THAT HOPEFULLY WE NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND THAT THEY INCORPORATE THAT. IN THE AUDIT AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT THE CI USE IS IS SAYING THAT WE MAKE SURE ON THIS IS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND AGAIN. AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE WILL AGREE. I LOOK AT THIS IS A WAY TO HIGHLIGHTED SUCCESSES NOT TO BE DEPARTMENT UP. AND AND AND AGAIN WHEN WE FINISH. GET FINALLY GET THE ACCOLADES THAT THEY NEVER GET. AND AND I'LL JUST HAVE MYSELF IS THAT IT IS OUR JOB AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT I MEAN THAT IS A HUGE PART OF OUR ROLE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY AND. HOW WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY? FOR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE AND THE IMPORTANCE AND I THINK IT'S ONLY. CORRECT OF THIS BODY TO TAKE ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ARE SPENDING MONEY ON IS. IS OPERATING IN THE WAY THAT WE UNDER THE UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT WE HAVE FUNDED THESE PROGRAMS ARE AND AND THIS IS IN NO WAY. ARMS WE ARE BOTH MYSELF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCERNS OF SEIU BUT THIS IS IN NO WAY MEANT TO BE. TAKEN AS SOMETHING THAT'S. CHALLENGING OR. AGGRESSIVE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT IT'S MORE ABOUT JUST WHAT WHAT. WHERE'S OUR MONEY GOING. YOU KNOW I I'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY FORMALLY INCARCERATED THOSE ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE BECAUSE I LOST AN OFFICER IN MY DISTRICT I AUTHORED AB FORTUNE AWAIT THAT DEALT WITH. A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES OF FLASH INCARCERATIONS AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID I WOULD APPRECIATE SENATOR BELL'S COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT. I SPECIFICALLY HAVE DOWN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. BUT I'M I I KNOW THAT THEIR OUTSIDE GROUPS TO COME IN AND PROVIDE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHERE ALL YOU DO IS IF YOU'RE AN INMATE YOU SIGNED INTO ON. THERE'S NO REAL. REQUIREMENT OR THERE'S THE THERE'S THE OVERALL REQUIREMENT THAT YOU STAY AND PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM HOWEVER THEY'RE GETTING PAID FOR ANY EVERY INMATE THAT SIGNS UP FOR THAT PROGRAM. WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY DO THE PROGRAM OR NOT OR WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY STAY IN IT OR NOT I AND WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF THAT'S HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE POINT OF THIS. AUDIT IS AND IT'S NOT TO MEANT TO BE ADDED TO BE AGGRESSIVE OR. OR AGAINST ANY WAY THE DEPARTMENT AYE BUT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AUDIT AYE AND AND IT'S JUST PROVIDING THE BASIC. OVERSIGHT ROLE AYE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WE. ANSWER. OVERDOSE. YEAH. ALRIGHT. APPRECIATE THE THAT THE REQUEST WE WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND SO ASSEMBLYMEMBERS PLEASE COME TO. DO YOUR DUTY. BUT. I I. HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE SEIU. LOOK ONE THOUSAND YESTERDAY AND. AND WHILE I. APPRECIATED THEIR THEIR CONCERNS ALSO IN THE LABOR FEDERATION'S CONCERNS ALSO. I TOLD SEIU. I RESPECT THE THE REQUESTER IS HERE MAIN. NOW NOT ONLY AS A AS A ADVOCATES FOR. FOR. PROPER OVERSIGHT FOR FOR. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVE. DATA BASED. REHABILITATION PROGRAMS MAKE SURE THAT WHERE WHERE AN INVESTING OUR STATE DOLLARS AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO THAT. YOU. ARE VERY RESPECTFUL OF THEIR WORKERS RIGHTS DE LA WORKERS ISSUES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED. INCLUDING THAT MEMBERSHIP OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND. SO. I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR AUDIT REQUEST. WE AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM WHO WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND A SECOND AND ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SCENE AND OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESIDENT GERMANY BICU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. ALRIGHT NEXT AYE SALSA REGAINS LE. A MAN IS CENTER AGAIN YES. THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN ON THE REGULAR CALENDAR. ITEM TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASH ONE ONE ZERO. I REQUEST FOR THIS CITY OF LINCOLN. SUBMITTED BY SARAH GAINES AND BEFORE I. TURN IT OVER. AS A PROCEDURAL MATTER. SOME LIMERICK COSTA DID YOU HAVE A REQUEST FOR. REMOVING ANY ITEMS FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR. NOT AT THIS TIME. ETCETERA. SURE I THINK THE FOLKS FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH I. UNDERSTOOD TO BE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. THAT'S NOT ITEMS THREE. OKAY IT'S THE CIVIC SITTING COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO MY NUMBERS ARE LINING UP BUT. ITEM NUMBER THREE SO AT. THE VICE CHAIRS REQUEST. WE WILL BE REMOVING ITEM NUMBER THREE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE SIXTEEN. THE ART A REQUEST BY SOMEONE MARIE GLORIA FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO TO BE REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR AND SO WE WILL HAVE. IRREGULAR HEARING ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH GAINS RATE WONDER FULL THANK YOU. CHAIR MURATSUCHI APPRECIATE IT MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVE AN AUDIT. OF THE CITY OF LINCOLN. CONDUCT A COMPLETE AUDIT AND REVIEW OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND ASSETS CONTROLLED BY THE CITY OF LINCOLN INCLUDING THE CITY'S ADMINISTRATION. OF THOSE FUNDS AND ASSETS. THE CITY OF LINCOLN'S FISCAL YEAR BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WILL EXCEED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE CITY MAINTAINS A MINIMUM OF. FORTY SEVEN SEPARATE FUNDS. RECENTLY CITIZENS CHALLENGED CITY BASED ON WATER RATES. AND MADE SOME DISTURBING FINDINGS. LEADING TO A BROADER CONCERNS OVER FAILURE TO COMPLY. WITH REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STATE LAW. AND A PATTERN SHOWING POOR INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FUND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES. THIS PATTERN COULD POINT TENCHI OFFER A HIGH RISK CITY. WHICH SHOULD IT FAIL. COULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO STEP IN WITH FUNDS TO BOLSTER THE CITY'S BUDGET. IN LATE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY OF LINCOLN WAS* CLOSER. FINANCIAL RECORDS REGARDING THEIR WATER SYSTEMS. RECORDS THEY CLAIM TO HAVE UTILIZED TO IMPOSE NEW WATER RATES UPON RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THE FINANCIALS PER DAY PRODUCED FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY PROP TWO EIGHTEEN. THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN RATES AND COSTS. ATTEMPTS BY TAXPAYERS TO COME. TWO ACCOMMODATION WITH THE CITY FOLLOWED. ULTIMATELY THE TAXPAYERS FOR FORCE TO FILE SUIT THE CITY IN A MEDIATED SETTLEMENT AGREED TO REFUND. RATE FEES BACK TO THE RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. FOLLOWING THEIR SUCCESS WITH RESIDENTIAL RATES THE SAME CITIZEN GROUP PASSED THE CITY. WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED DO ABOUT COMMERCIAL RATES WHICH HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL AWARD? THE CITY MANAGER IS NOT INCLINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE A LINK TO COMMERCIAL RATE PAYERS. THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL. IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CITY COUNCIL RECONSIDER THE CITY'S ACTIONS AFTER RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE POTENTIAL CITY LIABILITY. THE CITY COUNCIL OVERTURNED THE CITY MANAGER'S POSITION. AND VOTED AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN REFUNDS DATING BACK TO JANUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN. TOTAL REFUNDS CURRENTLY DO TAXPAYERS NOW STAND AT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WITH FURTHER EXAMINATION SUPPLE MORE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REFUNDS MAYBE DO RATE PAYERS THROUGH OTHER FUNDS. IN THE MEANTIME LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE RATE PAYER GROUP STUMBLED. ONTO THE FACT THAT THE CITY WAS USING WATER FOR FREE. APPROXIMATELY. AT THE RATE OF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THROUGH HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CITY OWN METERS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. THAT SENIOR STAFF AND SOME CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS WATER ASSET JUGGLING. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. THE CITY HAD ALSO GONE SO FAR AS TO CALL SUPPLY REPORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IN AN ATTEMPT TO COVER UP THEIR PRESUMED ILLEGAL USAGES. WHILE IN DISCOVERY CITIZENS DISCOVERED A PARENT MIS USES OF PUBLIC FUNDS FOR INSTANCE THE CITY ISSUE LOANS FOR REHABILITATION AND REDEVELOPMENT AREAS. WHICH ARE NEVER REPAID. FOLLOWING THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THE CITY PAID THEY SUCCESSOR FUNDS DEBT WITH MONIES FROM THE PLASTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY WHEN THERE WAS NO NEXUS BETWEEN WATER AND REHABILITATION. THESE PAYMENTS THAT WERE NOT DISCLOSED UNTIL FIVE YEARS LATER WHEN I REVISED REPORT WAS MADE TO THE STATE. I'M MORE DISTURBING EVENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WHEN THE CITY. CHARGED OFF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPER FEES A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISING WHEN DEVELOPERS DO NOT BUILD THEIR INTENDED PROJECT. THOUGH IN THIS CASE THE DEVELOPERS WERE ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITH THEIR PROJECTS THIS ACTION APPEARS TO BE A GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THESE FACTS SHOW OF POTENTIAL PATTERN OF MISMANAGEMENT AMONGST. SOME OF THE UPPER ECHELONS OF CITY GOVERNMENT IN LINCOLN. THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ROLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE RESPECTED AND RELIABLE STEWARDS OF THE PUBLIC TRUST AND ASSETS. BY CONDUCTING THIS AUDIT SEVERAL QUESTIONS CAN'T BE ANSWERED WITH REGARD TO THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENT STEWARDSHIP. OF THEIR FUNCTIONS. FINANCES ARE. SO. AT THIS POINT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REQUEST. THAT JAY LACKEY AND THE STATE AUDITOR. ENGAGE IN AN AUDIT REVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT FIVE FISCAL YEARS THE CITY OF LINCOLN. AND. I BELIEVE WE HAVE. SOME. WITNESSES. DOTTED DOT HODGKIN AND TED JONES. OKAY WITH WHATEVER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE REGAINS UP BEFORE WE PROCEED THERE WHERE RICH TRYING TO JUGGLE A.

I HAVE OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A BANK EXECUTIVE IN GOVERNMENT FINANCE. MIKE. AND THE MODEL MIGHT. MY NAME IS DONNA HIDE SAN AND I AM A RESIDENT OF LINK IN CALIFORNIA. PAVE OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A BANKING EXECUTIVE IN GOVERNMENT FINANCE CASH MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENTS. FOR STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. HAVE ALSO SERVEDAS CHAIR FOR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. I AM TERMED AN EXPERT WITNESS. I WAS APPOINTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE HAS THE BANKER FOR THAT ORANGE COUNTY BANKRUPTCY. AND THEN CONTINUED TO BANK ORANGE COUNTY POST BANKRUPTCY UNTIL I RETIRED. MY ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE CITY OF LINCOLN HAS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN. COULD LEAD THEM DOWN THAT SAME PATH AS ORANGE COUNTY. ALTHOUGH ALMOST SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IS BEING RETURNED TO RATE PAYERS FOR PROP TWO EIGHTEEN WATER RATE DILATION. THERE'S ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS DISCOVERED OVER SIX MONTHS AGO. WHERE WE HAVE YET TO HAVE HERE FROM THE CITY WIN THEY WILL RETURN RATEPAYERS MONIES? THE CITY'S LACK OF ACTION ON COLLECTION OF DEBTS FROM LOANS AND LEASES ALONG WITH CHARGING OFF DEVELOPER FEES HAS COST THE CITY OVER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY. OVER THE YEARS. THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE TERMED AS ON AUTHORIZED PUBLIC GIFT OF FUNDS. GOVERNMENT CODES IS VERY SPECIFIC ON TIMBER A SHORT TERM BORROWINGS WHICH INCLUDE ENOUGH INTER FUND BORROWINGS. A PURPOSE FOR THESE TYPES OF BAHRAIN'S IS FOR THE ANTICIPATED INCOME WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR. IT IS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING TEN YEAR LONG TERM DEBTS. THE CITY CURRENTLY HAS NINETEEN INTER FUND BAYERN'S DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR. FOURTEEN YEARS. ALMOST EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS PLUS LOSS OF INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS. AND SUBSIDIZING OTHER FUNDS. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS VALIDATE THERE'S NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. ONLY THE STATE AUDITOR CAN IDENTIFY ANY MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS WERE MISMANAGEMENT OF FUNDS FROM THE GOVERNMENT CODE OR CONSTITUTIONS PERSPECTIVE. TO DATE ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER FISCAL YEAR IN CLOSE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE CITY STILL HAS NOT. PROVED IN RELEASED THEY'RE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. CATHERINE. IF THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS PUBLISHED FINANCIALS WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THEIR YEAR END. ELEVEN MONTHS SHOULD BE VERY ALARMING TO ALL OF YOU. MA'AM I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO TREASURER UP WE THE CITIZENS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO TELL THE CITY. THAT THEY'VE OVER CHARGES FOR SERVICES OR TELL THEM TO USE GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION BEST PRODUCT PRACTICES. YET THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. I THINK YOU THE AUDIT IS NECESSARY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS TED JONES I'M A RESIDENT OF LINCOLN. I'M ONE OF THE NINE CITIZENS THAT. CAME TOGETHER. OVER A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. AND. ASK THE CITY IF THEY COULD REDUCE HER HIGH WATER RATES. WHAT BEGAN AS A REQUEST AND BECAME A YEAR LONG BATTLE WHERE WE? CHALLENGED ARE CITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. RELUCTANTLY THEY FINALLY AGREED TO RETURN OVER SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP TWO EIGHTEEN OVER CHARGES. DURING THIS TIME WE UNCOVERED THAT THE CITY WAS HIDING THEIR OWN WATER USAGE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN INDIVIDUAL METERS IN DOZENS OF LIGHTING AND LANDSCAPING DISTRICTS. IN ALL THE CITY PARKS AND AND ALL THE CITY FACILITIES. CLAIMING WATER LOSS. THIS RESULTED. IN AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CALLED THE MYERS NAY REPORT. WHICH CONCLUSIVELY SHOWED THAT MUCH OF THE SO CALLED WATER LOSS WAS IN FACT CITY USAGE. AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RATEPAYERS IN TERMS OF HIGHER RATES. THE CITY'S OWN WORDS THE LIGHTING AND LANDSCAPING DISTRICTS ALONG WITH THE GENERAL FUND COULD NOT SUPPORT PAYING THEIR OWN WAY. OUR QUESTION IS. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE RATE PAYERS ON FIXED INCOMES? ALL THE LIGHTING AND LANDSCAPING DISTRICTS ARE IN TOTAL DISARRAY. AND SHOW SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMPLIANCE AND ALLOCATION ISSUES. THERE ARE EIGHT OTHER ENTERPRISES FUNDS WHICH WE BELIEVE CLEARLY SHOW. OVER COLLECTION AND ADDITIONAL REFUNDS DO WHICH COULD TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT EXCEPTION. EVERYWHERE WE LOOK WE FIND SIGNIFICANT AND SHOES AND A HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES WHICH ARE ALWAYS MET WITH THE SAME STRATEGY. OF DENIAL AND PUSH BACK THIS IS WHY WE TURNED TO OUR SENATOR FOR HELP. IN CLOSING. OUR CITY SHOULD WELCOME AN AUDIT. IF IT IS IN FACT PROPERLY MANAGING ITS FINANCES. AND LIVING IN APPLYING THE CONSTITUTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. STATE ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE. AS AS CENTER GAINES INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE CITY LIKE AND WE WOULD START LOOKING AT THEIR GOVERNANCE AND AN OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE BUT PRIMARILY REALLY LOOKING AT THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOW THEY ARE CARRYING OUT THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES. ARE HE'S ASKED US AS HE INDICATED TO LOOK AT FIVE FISCAL YEARS ARE WORTH OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOOKING AT INTERNAL CONTROLS ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THOSE AUDITS. DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS OF CITYLINK AND HAS TAKEN TO CORRECT THOSE DEFICIENCIES BUT AS THE WITNESSES INDICATED ALSO LOOKING AT THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS LOOKING AT ENTER ENTER FUND LOANS. LOOKING AT ANY MONEY TRANSFERS COLLATERAL STATION OF CERTAIN PUBLIC MONIES. ALSO LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FOLLOWING REQUIRED LAWS AND REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING INCOME SPENDING ASSETS ABOUT THE. USAGE ARE OF BOTH WATER SEWAGE THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS RATE. RATE RATES ARE ACQUISITIONS AT CETERA ALSO ASSESSING THEIR COLLECTION AND REPORTING PROCESS IS FOR FEES NOT ONLY FOR RESIDENTIAL BUT AS A SENATOR INDICATED THE COMMERCIAL FEES AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING AT. FIVE YEARS WORTH OF OF WATER RATES AND DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT LINK AND REALLY HAS BEEN CHARGING IN EXCESS OF WHAT THEIR ACTUAL COSTS ARE. FOR THE WATER RATES. OBVIOUSLY DID THE CITIZENS PROVES CERTAIN INFORMATION BUT WILL BE LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW AND THEN LOOKING AT THE USE OF REDEVELOPMENT MONIES AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE READ. REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS WERE USED IN DISTRIBUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ANY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE CITY OF LINCOLN IS DOING IS TO COMMUNICATE TO. THE CITIZENS OF LATE OF THE CITY OF LINCOLN. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CHANGING RATES HOW ARE THEY MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS WHAT FACTORS INTO THEIR THEIR DECISION TO EITHER. INCREASE RATES LEAVE RATES AT THE SAME LEVEL OF THE AUDIT IS BUDGETED ABOUT TWO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS RELATIVELY SMALL AND AUDIT OF THAT SIZE WILL TAKE US ABOUT FIVE. FIGHT BETWEEN FIVE IN SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. I LIKE TO INVITE. RIMS CENTER FOR THE CITY LINCOLN IF ANYONE IS PRESENT PLEASE COME FORWARD. I CAN ASK YOUR SUPPORTING WITNESSES TO. PROVIDE THE SEEDS. THANK YOU THAT ORDER IS NOT IN TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. THANK HER BOY. WHEN WE GO FOR A FULL FIVE. SO SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS FIVE MINUTES OF ONE OF A SPEAKS. IF WE DIVIDE ACTUALLY IT'S IS TWO MINUTES A DAY BAG I I SHOULD HAVE ASKED LAID OUT TO BUT NORMALLY OUR GROUND RULES TWO MINUTES EACH FOR EACH HAVE A WITNESS DOWN. WE WE DID GIVE US SOME. EXTRA TIME FOR. THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE I REQUEST AND SO. FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER FOR THE TWO OF YOU ARE TRYING TO MOVE THROUGH THIS VERY QUICKLY THANK YOU MISTER SCHECK WHICH EIGHT THAT. ARE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SENATOR GAINES AND STAB MY NAME'S PAUL JOINER I AM A. WE CAN CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I'VE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL FOR TEN YEARS TO THOSE YEARS AS MAYOR. I'M JUST GOING TO JUMP TO THE MIDDLE MATTERS TIME AS IS OF THE ESSENCE. ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE SENATOR GAINES CONCERNS. HIS REQUEST IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR THE CITY OF LINCOLN TO BECOME IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK CITY AND THEREFORE. BE AT RISK OF BECOMING A BURDEN TO THE STATE. ACCORDING TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S WEBSITE HIGH RISK CITIES USUALLY EXHIBIT. PACIFIC FINANCIAL INDICATORS SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO PAY SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS LACK OF CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES. POOR REVENUE GROWTH A LACK OF ABILITY TO PAY RETIREE OBLIGATIONS AND A POOR FISCAL OUTLOOK OF THESE FIVE INDICATORS THE CITY OF LINCOLN DOES NOT ACCEPT IT A SINGLE ONE. THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ANNUAL BUDGET INCLUDED TOTAL EXPENDITURES OF ALMOST NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THE CITY'S CASH INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CITY HAS AMPLE ABILITY TO PAY ALL SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS. THE CITY OF SEVERAL RESERVES IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR IT TO RESPOND TO FINANCIAL EMERGENCY SHOULD THEY ARISE. OPERATING RESERVE EQUAL TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND OUTFLOWS FULLY FUNDED THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WILL BE FULLY FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AT OVER FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. CATASTROPHIC RESERVE SENATE TWO MILLION DOLLARS THE RESERVE IS FULLY FUNDED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN RESERVE FULLY FUNDED THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WILL BE FULLY FUNDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AT A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. CAPITAL RESERVE REPLACEMENT FULLY FUNDED THIS CURRENT YEAR AND WILL ALSO BE FULLY FUNDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OTHER POST EMPLOYEE BENEFITS HELP HAVE RESERVE. FULLY FUNDED THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WILL BE FULLY FUNDED AS INTENDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS. EACH OF THE CITIES THREE MAJOR ENTERPRISE FUNDS WATER SEWER AND SOLID WASTE ALSO HAS SEPARATE RESERVES FOR OPERATIONS IN CAPITAL REPLACEMENT. THESE RESERVES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CITY IS IN A GREAT POSITION TO WITHSTAND A FINANCIAL EMERGENCY. ANOTHER ONE OF THE FISCAL INDICATORS IS WHETHER THE CITY HAS AN ADEQUATE PROJECTED REVENUE. GROWTH RATE THE CITY CURRENTLY PROJECTS THE GENERAL FUND FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL INCREASE BY THREE POINT THREE PERCENT. NOW AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE NEARLY ALL LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE STATE ARE EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES RELATED TO FUTURE RETIREE OBLIGATIONS. THE CITY CURRENTLY FULLY FUNDS. THE CALPERS NORMAL COST WHICH IS THE ANNUAL COST OF SERVICE OF CRUEL. FOR THE UP FISCAL YEAR THE CITY PAYS IT'S REQUIRED ANNUAL PAYMENT FOR THE UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITY AT THE BEGINNING THE FISCAL YEAR AND THE CITY ALSO PAYS INTO THE OPEC TRUSTS. TO ENSURE PAYMENT TO FUTURE RETIREE HEALTH CARE OBLIGATIONS THE OPEC TRUST BALANCE AT THE END OF MARCH WAS OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. AS SUCH THIS DEMONSTRATES THE CITY IS ABLE TO PAY ITS RETIREE OBLIGATIONS. THE FINAL FINANCIAL INDICATOR IS WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY HAS SOUND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE INFORMATION I'VE ALREADY PROVIDED. IN THE CITY. HAS THE ABILITY. TO MEET OUR TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR MONTHLY INVESTMENT GOAL. FURTHER THE CITY HAS A NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PLACE TO MONITOR THIS IS THE CITY'S FISCAL OUTLOOK. NOT ONLY IS THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS VERY TRANSPARENT. AND PROVIDES FOR A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE THE CITY ALSO HAS A FISCAL INVESTMENT IN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THAT IS COMPOSED OF TWO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THE ELECTED CITY TREASURER. TO STAFF MEMBERS AND TO CITIZENS AT LARGE. BASED ON THIS FACT. BASED ON THE FACT THAT I'VE GONE OVER. THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT CITY OF LINCOLN IS AT RISK OF BECOMING AN AT RISK CITY. NOW OTHER ISSUES THE SENATOR GAMES. REQUEST POINTS TO. OUR CHALLENGES CITY IS ALREADY TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO RESOLVE. LIKE NUMBER CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE CITY DID HAVE A LEGAL ISSUE RELATED TO TIERED WATER RATES STRUCTURE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED THE ISSUANCE OF REFUNDS TO CUSTOMERS. LIKE MANY OTHER CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE CITY WAS HISTORICALLY NOT PAYING FOR MEN IS MUNICIPAL UTILITIES THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE CITY EVEN WENT FURTHER AND AUTHORIZED A FACT FINDING INVESTIGATION. WHICH THE OTHER WITNESSES SPOKE TO A ON THIS ISSUE RESULTING IN A REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE CAPPER REPORT THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT SUPPOSEDLY HAD NOT COME FORWARD WAS APPROVED AT OUR LAST COUNCIL MEETING. SO AS I'VE DEMONSTRATED THE CITY OF LINCOLN IS NOT ONLY FISCALLY STABLE BUT ALSO TAKES THE APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. WHEN AN ISSUE ARISES. ALTHOUGH AN AUDIT CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO IDENTIFY ISSUES THE CITY OF LINCOLN SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THE STAFF RESOURCES. SUPPORT AND AUDIT OF THE TYPE THAT SENATOR GAINES IS REQUESTING DOING SO WOULD PREVENT STAFF WORKING ON MUCH. NEEDED PROJECTS THAT WILL FOR TAXPAYERS. AS SUCH. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CITY'S FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW THE FACTS PROVIDED IN OUR RESPONSE LETTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THAT WAS A TOTAL SO I BELIEVE YOU OF. THE GIVEN YOUR TIME TO YOUR COLLEAGUE ON THE COUNCIL. WE HAVE ANY REMAINING MISTER CHAIRMAN I ACTUALLY IT WAS PRETTY ALMOST PRECISELY FIVE MINUTES IF YOU HAVE A FEW WORDS TO JUST A FEW COMMENTS OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

IN RESERVE. WITH A STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BORROW FROM ONE. I COVER IN ANOTHER. ALWAYS GIVING THE INTENT AS TO WHEN AND HOW YOU'LL PAY IT BACK. I'D LOVE TO SEE. THIS CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED CITIES OF CALIFORNIA MATCH US UP IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL STABILITY THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO SYSTEM MADE BY MS BAKER SECONDED BY MONTHS SIR OBERNOLTE THIRD BY MISTRESS CENTER ROTH. A QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE YES ADEQUATE ARE LOWER UP THE SCORES FOR THE AUDITOR I KNOW THE OPPONENTS TALKED ABOUT THE HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM. AND HIGHLIGHTED THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FALL UNDER THAT. BUT GIVEN THAT THIS AUDIT IS BEING BROUGHT UP INDEPENDENTLY. BOB NOT FROM YOUR OFFICE BUT FROM THE AUTHOR THEREFORE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY PERFECT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE I. ALSO APPRECIATE TO SARAH LAWRENCE A QUESTION BECAUSE THEY AYE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AND THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL MEMBER OF. THE CITY OF LINCOLN AND APPRECIATES THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST UNDER THE AUDITOR'S. A HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM. SO WHILE THERE WAS A REFERENCE INSERTED REGAINS IS REQUEST LETTER FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR A HIGH RISK CITY. THE NATURE OF THE REQUEST IS FOCUSING ON ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT START DANCES WELL AS A SUPPORTED WITNESSES OCCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO BE THE WATER RATES AND AND AND AND DID DISPUTES AND SO. I'M SURE. THE. THE FACTS OF THE U. PRESENTED IN TERMS OF YOUR RESERVES IN YOUR YOUR. FISCAL MANAGEMENT OVERALL THE CITY THAT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE OF THE AUDIT SAID THE THE ISSUES ARE AS. NOT SPECIFIED IN CENTER AGAINST THIS REQUEST. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WOULD WITH ANY AUDIT REQUESTS ESPECIALLY ON SMALLER CITIES WITH. THE GOOD OF THE DAY. THE BURDEN AND THE DISRUPTION TO NORMAL CITY OPERATIONS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. DEAR YOU DO NEED TO. ADDRESS WITH YOUR SENATOR. BUT. AYE I THINK THE MOTION'S BEEN MADE AND SECONDED THIRD IT. AND.

THAT HAVE ARISEN THAT FOR WHICH CITIZENS OF THE CITY HAD TO COME FORWARD. AND. WORK VERY HARD AND I WOULD SAY EVEN BATTLE WITH THE CITY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT REFUNDS FOR MADE ON THE WATER ISSUE AND THAT WAS JUST ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE SO. OTHERS ISSUES ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE THERE'S ISSUES WITH REDEVELOPMENT. THERE'S ISSUES WITH SPECIAL FUNDS. THAT IN MY VIEW WARRANT. AND AUDIT AND IF THERE'S NOTHING TO BE FOUND. THAT'S GREAT AND. YOU'VE GOTTA CLEAN BILL HEALTH AND YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT CLARITY PROVIDED FOR THE CITIZENS SO THEY CAN HAVE COMPLIMENTS THAT. THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS IS RUNNING IN THE RIGHT FASHION AND THEY CAN HAVE A FAITH AND TRUST.

ARE RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH THE UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. WELCOME SEVERAL ARE THANK YOU. THINK IT WAS CHAIR MEMBERS IN REQUESTING THE AUDITOR EXAMINED CITY IN COUNTY JAILS A CONTRACT WITH ICE TO DETAIN IMMIGRANTS REFUGEES. UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ON ASYLUM SEEKERS HELD IN CIVIL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY RELATED TO THEIR IMMIGRATION CASE. THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS HAS OVERSIGHT PURVIEW OF CITY AND COUNTY JAILS AS YOU ON NO. BUT DOES NOT MONITOR ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IMMIGRATION DETENTION IN JAIL THAT DOES NOT TRACK WHICH JAILS. DETAIN IMMIGRANTS TYPE. TYPES OF LENGTH AND CONTRACTS REVENUES RECEIVED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DETAINED LENGTH OF DETENTION DEMOGRAPHICS OF. PERSONS DETAINED ARE OR THE OUTCOMES OF THE DETENTION INCLUDING DEPORTATIONS OR DEATHS AMONG OTHER VALUABLE DATA. NEARLY A DOZEN CITY IN COUNTY JAILS ACROSS THE CITY ACROSS THE STATE I'M SORRY CONTRACT CONTRACT WITH ICE. TO DETAIN IMMIGRANTS AND CIVIL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY AND THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION SYSTEM IS A CLOSED SYSTEM THAT LACKS TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE TO OUR POLICY AND BUDGET COMMITTEES HAS HOW TO FISH FOR INFORMATION COUNTY BY COUNTY CITY BY CITY. AND OR RESORT TO WORK WITH ADVOCATES TO OBTAIN DOCUMENTS AND DATA SECURE TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS. TO GET PIECEMEAL INFORMATION ABOUT ACTIVITIES IN OUR LOCAL PUBLIC FACILITIES. WHILE CONTRACTS OFTEN INCLUDE PAYMENTS OR GRANTS TO THE CITY OR COUNTY IN EXCHANGE FOR BADS OR DETENTION SERVICES IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE PAYMENT TO THE COVERS. THE LOCAL COST OF HOW MUCH IF AT ALL THE STATE IS SUBSIDIZING THESE CONTRACTS WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS THAT CAN HELP PIECE TOGETHER THE BIG PICTURE. OF THIS PRACTICE HALL OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD KNOW HOW FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THIS PRACTICE IS BEING UTILIZED OR MANAGED SO AS TO INFORM THE STATE PARK. OUR STATE POLICY AND BUDGET DECISIONS. THE AUDIT WILL IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE THE FISCAL IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL JAILS AS A RESULT OF CONTRACTING WITH ICE. THE DATA IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CONSISTENT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. FOR EXAMPLE THIS AUDIT CAN HELP IDENTIFY WHETHER STATE FUNDS ARE SUPPLANTING FEDERAL DOLLARS WHEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RENTS PADS. TO FADS BUT THEN COMES TO REQUEST JOE CONSTRUCTION FUNDING AIMED AT ADDRESSING OVERCROWDING. ADDITIONALLY DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WILL BE VALUABLE. TO CLARIFY WHETHER OUR HOUSING ARE WHETHER WE ARE HOUSING OR HAVE HOUSED. PASTE OR TRANSFERRED ANY OF THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN THAT ARE STILL MISSING. ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY FOR THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY SUBCOMMITTEE ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED MIGRANT CHILDREN PLACED IN HOMES OF ADULT SPONSORS BY FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTY WENT MISSING LAST YEAR. ARE THEY IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE GROUP HOMES FROM FAMILY PLACEMENTS JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. ARE THEIR PARENTS ALSO DETENTION HAVE THEY BEEN SEPARATED HAVE THESE CHILDREN DIED OR HAVE THE BEEN DEPORTED. WE HAVE NO IDEA OF KNOWING WHERE THESE CHILDREN ARE. THAT AND WHETHER YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE WE'RE AT ON THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. WE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE CHILDREN ARE WHERE ARE THE BEING PLACED. AYE IF WE DON'T KNOW IF THESE CHARGES HAVE BEEN RELEASED IT TO COMMUNITIES. WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD KNOW SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THEY'RE BEING SUPPORTED INTEGRATED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AFFORDED DUE PROCESS. AGAIN MEMBERS. AT THE STATE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO CARE AND ACCOUNT FOR THE INNOCENT IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE CHILDREN THE CONTINUED REMAIN MISSING TODAY. ARE STRICTLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU HAVE ANY OF WITNESSES WHO PART OF YOUR REQUESTS. ANY WITNESSES OF YES. AS CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT WE DON'T CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE. ON A REQUEST BY THE SENATOR WE THINK THAT WITH THE. STEPS LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN TO LAST FOR YEARS TO ENSURE THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS AND I IMMIGRANTS. THAT THIS IS A TIMELY MEASURE THAT WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO ENSURE THAT. OUR TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT WITH SHOULD BE SPENT PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IT IMMIGRANTS AND I'M GOING TO GET IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS SENATOR LARA INDICATED THIS WOULD BE LOOKING AT. STARTING AT THE STATE LEVEL LOOKING UP CALIFORNIA BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED AND OVERSEEING JAILS THAT CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UP SPECIFICALLY HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW AND GET GATHERING SOME INFORMATION AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS DETAINED IN THESE CONTRACT DEALS FOR REASONS. REGARDING IMMIGRATION STATUS THE DURATION OF AMOUNT OF ANY STATE OR LOCAL. MONEY THAT'S BEING USED TO SUPPORT. PARTICULAR CONTRACTS OVER AND ABOVE THE FEDERAL MONEY. THAT THE AYE AYE SPACE TO TO THESE CONTRACT JAILS HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK AT A SELECTION OF CONTRACT YELLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE LOOKING AT BOTH OUR CURRENT CONTRACT OR RECENT CONTRACT. ALL THAT THEY'VE HAD WITH WITH ICE AND AGAIN LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT IS COMING INTO THESE FACILITIES POWER THE FACILITIES USING THE FEDERAL MONEY AS A SENATOR INDICATORS IT BEING USED TO EXPAND. THE CAPACITY OF THESE PARTICULAR FACILITIES ARE THERE ANY LIMITS PLACED IN THOSE CONTRACTS AS FAR AS MONETARY CAPS ON THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY. THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE CONTRACT JAILS IF THERE ARE IF THE EXPENDITURES EXCEED THAT WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT THE JAILS ARE USING. OUGHT TO PROVIDE. NAM TOOK TO COVER THE EXCESSIVE OUR EXPENSES RELATED TO THOSE. TO THOSE DETAINEES ON IN ADDITION LOOKING AT THE HOUSING ARE THESE DETAINEES HOUSED IN A A DIFFERENT. OUR ENVIRONMENT VAN CRIMINAL DETAINEES ARE THEY HOUSE TOGETHER WHAT KIND OF REQUIREMENTS ARE THE JAILS CONSIDERING WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO. DETAINING HER HOUSING THE THE DETAINEES AS HE INDICATED HE IS ASKING FOR SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT A FIVE OR SIX YEAR WINDOW FOR TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. LOOKING AT AGES NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE LOOKING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ANY CHILDREN BEING DETAINED. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY DEATHS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. DURING THE TIME THE INDIVIDUALS WERE DETAINED IF POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF DEATH. DECIDE IT'S BUDGETED AT A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND HOURS THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE FEEL WE NEED TO GO TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS ARE WILL DO SOME WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE EFFORT WILL BE. AT THESE CONTRACT JAILS. THAT ARE ARE CONTRACTING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN HOT INDIVIDUALS FOR IMMIGRATION RELATED REASONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY IDENTIFIED. ARE RESPONDING AGENCIES BUT ARE THERE ANY. REPRESENT IS OF ANY. CHRIS POTENTIAL RESPONDING AGENCIES IN THE AUDIENCE. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATE. SOME OF OUR BAKER THANK YOU AND DAM. I YEAH YOU MAY HAVE COVERED THIS I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING THEM RIGHT AFTER. BUT I FIRST WENT BEFORE WE. AND SEND THE AUDITOR SOMEWHERE ADDS IMPORTANT TO SEE THE EFFECT THAT IT MAY WHERE. THE OUTER MAY END UP IN THE AFFECT THAT MAY HAVE ON EITHER EXISTING AUDITS ARE OVERSIGHT IN REVIEW. SO HAVE QUESTIONS TO THAT AND FOR BOTH THE AUDITOR IN OUR AUTHOR. OF THE AUDITOR THE ENTITIES. THAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING TO AUDIT. IN THE PAST YOU'VE MENTIONED WHEN THE I DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY PARTICULAR AGENCIES WHERE THOSE MIGHT BE. CAN YOU ADDRESS HOW YOU WILL CHOOSE WHICH ENTITIES YOU WOULD GO TO OR WOULD YOU GO TO THE WHOLE I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE FIVE. WERE SIX IN THE STATE THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE S.. REQUEST YEAH AND THANK YOU MISS MS BAKER I'M IN THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS THAT I'VE LOOKED AT IT I'VE SEEN A RANGE BETWEEN NINE AND TWELVE DIFFERENT FACILITIES IN THE STATE. I ALSO LOOKED AT SOME INFORMATION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID SOME. UNANNOUNCED VISITS AND THERE WERE TWO FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAD SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO INCLUDE THOSE TWO FACILITIES. AND THEN PICK. A HANDFUL OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES TO GET REGIONAL AS WE OFTEN DO NOW NORTH SOUTH. AND ALSO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF DETAINEES IN THOSE DIFFERENT FACILITY SO WE WOULD TRY TO PICK A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE ACROSS THE STATE BUT. THERE WERE TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AGAIN DID AN UNANNOUNCED VISIT AND REALLY WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONDITION SO I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE THE IG WAS IN THERE. ABOUT THREE AGO AND THOSE TWO WHERE. I'D HAVE TO GRAB MY BACKGROUND MATERIAL I THINK IT WAS. THERE IS A. WHAT IF ANOTHER MEMBER KNOWS? I I'LL HAVE TO THINK YOU. HIS I DID NOT SEE THAT TWO MENTIONED. SPECIFICALLY THE MATERIALS SPECIFICALLY MENTION BUT. HERE'S MY. MY WEEKEND HOMEWORK. WE'LL FIND IT FOR A VERY QUICK THANK YOU. AND. AYE WELL THAT WELL AUDITOR AND THANK YOU FOR LOOKING FOR THAT MAYBE ADDRESS MY NEXT TO THE. OUR AUTHOR IN THAT IS. YOU KNOW THESE GOING INTO THESE. AGENCIES DOES YOU KNOW. PICKED STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES AWAY IN THIS WOULD BE OF COURSE FOLKS ARE OPERATING A JAILER LA ENFORCEMENT FACILITY. AND SO IT'S AYE WANNA AYE I'M USUALLY RETICENT TO PROVIDE ITS THAT EITHER THERE'S A PENDING AUDIT ALREADY GOING ON OR WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION WITHOUT THE AUDIT. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST QUESTION UNDERSTANDING OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS DIRECTED I BELIEVE LAST YEAR TO HAVE BY. BY MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN A REVIEW OF THESE ENTITIES. IF I'M. IF THERE IS AN INTEREST IN TRYING I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT IS. IF THAT WOULD MAKE EITHER DUPLICATIVE WORK FOR WHAT OUR AUDITOR WILL BE DOING OR AND WE DO NEED TO FIGHT FIND OUT WITH THE AG'S GONNA DO WE ALREADY HAVE. SENT THE AG INTO THIS I THINK THE SAME ENTITIES. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLEASE EARLY THIS IS A WEEK WEEKS WE SEE THIS AUDIT OF COMPLIMENTARY TO WHAT THE AG IS ALREADY DOING. THE AG IN A SENSE IS LOOKING AT OUR CURRENT CONDITIONS OF WHAT IS OCCURRING AT SOME OF THE. PRIVATE FOR PROFIT. DETENTION CENTERS THIS IS FOCUSING ON OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES WHERE. WE STILL LACK SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT. EVEN STATISTICAL DATA ON HOW MANY. DETAINEES WE HAVE ONE OF THE CONDITIONS IN THESE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TRYING TO LOOK AT. THE THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE COMING DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN HAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COME TO US AND SAYING WE WE NEED MORE MONEY FOR JOE CONSTRUCTION. AND WE'RE SAYING THAT THE MONEY IS A MONEY OFFSETTING. THEN THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTUALLY DETAINING PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUAL CRIMINALS IN THE SYSTEM SO IT WE FEAR OF COMPLEMENTARY WE ACTUALLY. REVIEW WOULD. WE ACTUALLY HAD THE AG REPEALED AUDIT REQUEST TO LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK. DUPLICATIVE IN THEIR WORK AND SO THEY THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS COMPLEMENT YOU TO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING GIVEN THAT THIS IS FOCUSING ON THE THE PUBLIC. FACILITIES AND I I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANYONE FROM AGES OFFICERS HERE IMAGINE THAT IF THERE IS A BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU REACHED OUT TO THE AG'S OFFICE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. WHAT WE DIRECTED THEM TO DO JUST LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET? WHICH I SUPPORTED WAS TO HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF COUNTY. JAIL FACILITIES AND PRIVATE SO THAT IT IS. A LOOKING AT THE VERY SAME ENTITIES THAT COULD BE COVERED BY THIS AND THAT THE AG ISN'T JUST LOOKING AT PRIVATE RECENT THAT YOU'RE UNDERSTAND IS THE AGES LOOKING ONLY A PRIVATE WELL WE. WE'VE FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO INTO THE PRIVATE FACILITIES WHICH THEY DIDN'T HAVE NOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AGE IS GOING TO GO IN AND LOOK AT THE HONG GOING CURRENT SITUATION OF. NOT ONLY WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE WHAT THE. ICE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE WHEN IT CAME TO ACCESS TO MEDICATION ACCESS TO. DUE PROCESS ACCESS TO SHELTER. AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN CONDITIONS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE AUDITOR'S TO GO MUCH MORE BEYOND THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A TO STATISTICAL DATA. THOUGH HISTORIC DATA OF HOW MANY FOLKS ARE ARE BEING HELD HOW MANY UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE THERE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THERE'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED. CHILDREN THAT ARE MISSING AND WE HAVE AND THE US GOVERNMENT HAS NO IDEA WHETHER AT WHERE THEIR PLACE SO WE'RE ASKING WHERE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE KNOW IF THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE ARE THEY ARE THE BEING PLACED ON THE WHAT THE DEPORTED. HAVE THE PASSED AWAY WE DON'T THERE'S NO DATA TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT SO WE'RE ASKING THE AUDITOR TO GO IN AND HAVE A DEEPER LOOK INTO A MORE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OF WHERE WE KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT'S. ALL THE INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. BEFOREHAND HAVE BEEN EITHER TO ADVOCATES OR TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. SO THIS WILL GIVE THEM A BETTER COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT ONLY THE FINANCING OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF. THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO ARE THEY ACTUALLY GOING TO SERVICE THIS COMMUNITY. OR ARE THE YOU KNOW BEING USED TO SUPPLANT FUNDS FOR. GROWING THAT THE PRISON THE LOCAL PRESENTER JAILS OF SELF THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT ARE DIFFERENT AND AGAIN THE AG DID LOOK AT OUR LETTER. AND THOUGHT IT WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO WHAT WE WERE WHAT THEIR WORK TO DURING THANK YOU AYE. AYE I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT WE ARE WE HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW THAT WE HAVE ASKED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DO THAT THAT MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY BUT ALSO DUPLICATIVE SINCE THE RESOURCES TO BE GOING INTO THE SAME. AND THEN IT GOES TO THE THE WHERE YOU MENTION THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. INFORMATION FROM FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT USUALLY AND I I AT LEAST LOOK AT I LOOK AT IS THIS WHEN CITY STATE AUDITOR IS A CHOICE OF LAST RESORT BUT WE'VE BEFORE WE SPEND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THREE THOUSAND HOURS. FOR THE AUDITOR LOOKING INTO THIS AND THE DISRUPTION THAT IT HASN'T LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. FACILITIES THAT WE MAKE SURE THIS ISN'T DATA THAT CAN BE ACQUIRED. ELSEWHERE. HAVE YOU DONE OR HAVE YOU MENTION FOR YOUR REQUESTS HAVE THERE BEEN EFFORTS TO DO THAT AND HAVE THEY NOT RESULTED IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU WOULD LIKE BEEN IT'S BEEN VERY PATCHWORK AND IT'S BEEN VERY PIECEMEAL WHICH TAKES A LOT OF TIME FROM THE ADVOCATES AND. WITH THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THEM. DAVID HAD VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE. FACILITIES AND IN ONE OF THE INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE ON ONE OF OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JAILS. THEY WERE HOUSING HOW MANY CHILDREN. THEY WERE HOUSING TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN THAT WE HAD NO IDEA I MANY OF WHICH ALREADY HAD WANDER ASYLUM CASE BUT WAS STILL BEING HELD YOU KNOW IT LOCATION THAT WAS IN THAT BOOK. OKAY NO. I'M SORRY YOLO COUNTY YOLO COUNTY. A AND SO THE FOYER RICK HAVE BEEN A LITTLE I MEAN THEY ARE DIFFICULT FOR FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EASY BUT THEY ARE ARE THEY ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC INFORMATION. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ALSO THAT. MUCH OF THE INFORMATION MAY BE REQUESTED IT LISTED SOME OF THE LOCATIONS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY TRACK IT SOMETHING THAT ICE HOUSE. HAVE YOU ARE OR THESE ORGANIZATIONS REACHED OUT TO ICE TO GET THAT INFORMATION AGAIN IT'S BEEN THROUGH FOIA REQUEST WHICH AGAIN TAKES TIME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HAVE BEEN OVER A HUNDRED DEATHS. OF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT OF THEIR SOME TRENDS AND PATTERNS IN WHERE. WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING SO IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT. JOURNEY TRYING TO GET INFORMATION AND GIVEN THAT THE POPULATION FLUCTUATES AND OUR CONCERT MOVING WE WERE TIME MAKE SURE WE GET THE DATA AND THE STATISTICS AGAIN. THE HG IS LOOKING AT THE CURRENT. HEALTH AND CONDITION OF OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION AND. UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE REFUGEES THIS AUDIT WILL GO MORE IN DEPTH THAN LOOKING AT. STATISTICAL DATA ABOUT YOU KNOW FOUGHT BACK FIVE YEARS THIS IS WHY. THE THE THE HONORS THE AUDITS LOW PRICEY BUT IT'S INFORMATION WE DON'T HAVE NOW WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY FOLKS ARE BEING HELD WHAT THEIR STATUS IS OF THEIR. THEIR IMMIGRANT CASE. ARE THEY BEING. ACASO BEFORE SOME OF THOSE CHILDREN HAD REALLY WANT ASYLUM CASE BUT WERE STILL BEING HELD TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS. SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW I MEAN DEPENDING ON ONCE WE GET THAT INFORMATION WILL BETTER KNOW AND DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO ACCORDINGLY. SO AGAIN WE FEEL THAT THIS IS COMPLIMENTARY BUT I I RETORTED ASSIGN YOUR QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T IF WE WANNA WE DON'T WANT TO. REDUPLICATED WORKED AT THE AGE IS DOING AGAIN THIS IS WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WE CHECK WITH WITH THEIR OFFICE FIRST AND THE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AND IS MY AGE AND IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASK THAT THE AG'S OFFICE HAS BEEN GIVEN. AND AN AMOUNT OF TIME TO WHICH IS MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN OR SPRING YOU KNOW YEAR FROM NOW. TO TO GET THAT AND IT DOES MAKE ME HESITANT TO TO THEN HAVE ANOTHER PROCESS WE'VE WE'VE APPROVED DIES BEFORE MANY TIMES A DIFFERENT AGENCIES WE END UP WITH THEM SPENDING A WHOLE LOT OF TIME. AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE DELAY TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING SOMETHING FOR IT. LOOKS INTO THIS AT IS THE AUDITOR HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TWO ENTITIES WERE. RIGHT TO TO FACILITY SANTA ANA CITY JAIL WAS ONE FACILITY ACCORDING TO THE IG REPORT THAT'S A MIXED GENDER FACILITY SO HOUSING MALES AND FEMALES. AND THEN THE OTHER FACILITY AS THEO LACY WHICH IS AN ORANGE COUNTY. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO FACILITIES THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HOMELAND SECURITY A CASE RECENTLY VISITED THANK YOU. AYE YEAH AYE AGAIN I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE BUDGET LAST YEAR INCLUDING THIS REQUEST. THE THE THE REVIEW IN THE OVERSIGHT. AND I DO KNOW THAT ICE ALSO CONDUCTS TO SEPARATE. OVERSIGHT. REPORTS AND FUNCTIONS THEMSELVES INDEPENDENT FROM WHAT THE AG'S OFFICE IS DOING. I I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO. I I SUPPOSE IDEALLY I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS HAPPEN AFTER THE AG'S REPORT. IS COMING FORWARD CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION IS WORTH HAVING. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE LOOK AT IT AND ALSO THAT THERE IS A GEOGRAPHIC BALANCE POPULATION BALANCE. AND. YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE COUNTY VERSES CITY AND I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A BALANCE FOR THAT AND HOW IT MAY PRIORITIZE SO THANK YOU FOR. THE ANSWER MAKE YOU APPRECIATE QUESTIONS ARE ALL IMPORTANT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SORROWFUL. SO I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON. WE ALREADY HAVE THIS. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BEING INVESTIGATED. AND OUR CALLING FOREIGN AUDIT BUT THE AUDIT DESCRIPTION SOUNDS LIKE AN INVESTIGATION MORE THAN A NOT IT. AND SO WOULD YOU CLARIFY THAT DIFFERENCE TWO NECESSARILY SO THE HG. AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSPOKE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE HAVING YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF NEXT TO YOU. INTO. THE EIGHTY G. OTHER LE ARE LOOKING INTO PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FACILITIES AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT TWO BEINGS THE STANDARD OF CONDUCT THE STANDARD OF CARING CONDITION. OF THE CONFINEMENT. SO THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL AN INVESTIGATION. THE A PUBLIC ART IT IS MORE ON DATA FISCAL ANALYSIS ON WHERE THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY BEING USED. FROM THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE BEING DRAWN DOWN ON THE ACTUALLY BEING USED TO HOUSE IMMIGRANTS TO CARE FOR THE IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING DETAINED AND THE REFUGEES. AND THEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHO ARE THESE FOLKS WE HAVE NO IDEA. WHETHER HOW MANY WHAT TYPE OF IMMIGRANT THEY ARE WHAT WHETHER CASES SO THAT THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENCES THAT IS AN AUDIT. WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. GIVEN THE COST OF THIS AUDIT. IT HAS SOME GOOD INTENTIONS BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER LAYERED ON TOP. AFTER. CURRENT INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED AND WHEN THERE WE COULD MAY BE. A TIME LIMIT OR. NARROWER FOCUS. THE AUDIT REQUEST. RIGHT NOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF OVERLAP. AND. I REALLY DON'T. HIT I DON'T THINK IT'S. WE DON'T WE RARELY HAVE ENOUGH BY THE TIME FOR OUR AUDITOR TO AUDIT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED. SAYS IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. IT WOULD BE BETTER TO STREAMLINE THIS. AUDIT AT A LATER DATE AFTER WE ALREADY HAVE. A DONE THE INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND WE KNOW SOME MORE THINGS ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE WANT TO TRACK. AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS QUESTION. A LOT OF THIS QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ANSWERED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. A IN OTHER VENUES ANYWAY AND SO MAYBE. WE WOULD GET DOWN TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MAY BE MORE USEFUL FOR. FOUR OR PAYING BUT I I DO. APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD. AND. CERTAINLY I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THAT CURRENT INVESTIGATIVE OF REPORT TO INFORM US OF WHAT OUR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE. RICHARD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW. THANK YOU I'M I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS I THINK. AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN I READ THE REPORTS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED KIDS BEING GONE AYE IT'S IT JUST TO ME NOT KNOWING. HOW MANY FOLKS ARE IN THOSE FACILITIES AND NOT KNOWING THE NAMES ARE THAT'S THE CASE IS? DISTURBING. BECAUSE. I I WAS UNDER THE THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN SOMEBODY WAS ADMITTED THAT THEY WOULD. YOU KNOW DOCUMENT WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE AND IF WE CAN'T FIND FIFTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN I THINK THAT THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT AG IS DOING. A SEPARATE AUDIT AND NOT ON CONDITIONS AND THIS IS. AT STATISTICS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO OTHER FACILITIES. I HAVE A SITUATION IN MY CITY WHERE WE CAN'T FIND. THE SPOUSE OF ACTUALLY MY NEIGHBOR. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MIS COMMUNICATED IS INFORMATION. TO THE SPOUSE AND SO. AT FIRST SHE WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE IN. BRAWLEY I THINK AND SHE WENT THERE AND HE WASN'T THERE AND SO TO ME IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE FIND. AT LEAST TO IDENTIFY WITH THESE FOLKS ARE SO THAT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OR THAT THE FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE YOU AT LEAST WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE. IF THEY'RE THERE OR IF THEY'RE NOT THERE BUT I APPRECIATE THAT. AND NIGHT I SHARE YOUR CONCERN BUT I THINK. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IT'S NOT LIKE WE LOST THE CAR BROADLY TO IF WE LOSE CHILDREN THAT'S A OF BIG CONCERN TO US ARE TO ME. ANYWAY SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND AND. ALSO THE THE YOU KNOW FOR PURE FROM THE AUDITOR THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE TIME AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO DO THIS AND I THINK IT'S OF THE ESSENCE THAT WE DO THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ANYONE THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE ANY OF FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SAYING NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH LARA AYE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE. THE. COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF YOUR REQUEST. HAVING WORKED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE I AM ACTUALLY NOT SURE WHO. OR RAZA WHAT RESOURCES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD HAVE IN TERMS OF COMPILING. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE SEEKING. AND SO. CHILDREN ARE MISSING. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND ARE SITTING COUNTY JAILS. AND I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR IF YOU REQUEST WHICH LIKE IT OUGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU AGAIN AND I I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND AND THE CLARIFICATION ON. THE WORK THAT THE AG IS DOING THAT TO ME YOU KNOW THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU'RE AT ON THE IMMIGRATION SPECTRUM. YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SO MUCH IN IN CALIFORNIA CHIU NOT ONLY SHED SOME LIGHT. I'M THE SERVICES AND AND. ISSUES THAT ARE BEING. HIGHLIGHTED AS IMPORTANT FOR IMMIGRANT REFUGEE AND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. YOU KNOW THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN DO THEIR JOBS. ARE IN THE PRISONS AND IN THE JAILS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE DATA THAT WE NEED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. AND ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT IF THE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY BEING PUT TO USE FOR THESE. FOR THESE FOLKS AND NOT BEING USE JUST A PLANT OR THEN THE IRONY OF THEM HAVING TO CREATE MORE BADS. NOT GETTING ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN COMING TO THE STATE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL PRINT I'VE JOKERS PRISON CONSTRUCTION MONEY OR JUMP CONSTRUCTION MONEY. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEDS SO THIS WOULD SHED SOME LIGHT GIVE US SOME DATA AND ALLOW US TO MOVE APPROPRIATELY IN AND AND AGAIN IT IS COMPLEMENTARY. TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS DOING WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM. SIDE BY SIDE ON THIS ISSUE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANKS VERY MUCH. CAN I ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MS RUBIO. MOVED BY MS RUBIO.

THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDATIONS AND AYE VOTES ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERCY CHANGE WHERE CG I ACOSTA. BAKER. BAKER I IS ARYAN. OBERNOLTE. RUBIO AYE RUBIO I WOULDN'T. SENATOR ROTH. ALLEN BELL. CANNELLA FULLER. FULLER NO. LARA AYE LARA AYE. ALRIGHT THE REQUESTED ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT I BELIEVE SEVERAL GAINES JUST BEAT OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA ON THE SIGN UP LIST AND SO YES SORRY I MEAN SEVERAL GALGIANI AT POLICIES. THIS SERVES ITEM NUMBER TEN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S ONE FIFTEEN. ON A REQUEST BY SENATOR GALGIANI. ON. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT A REQUEST TO AUDIT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN WHICH IS A PUBLICLY SPONSORED NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION ENROLLED AS A MEDIC HELP FIGHTER. SPECIFICALLY I'M REQUESTING THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT INTO BONUS PAYMENTS MADE TO PERSONNEL AT THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN. AND D. H. CS IS OVERSIGHT INCLUDING OVERSIGHT OF SUCH PAYMENTS OR PRACTICES. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEALTH PLANS SAM KEEN PROVIDES A VITAL SERVICE TO MANY CHILDREN SENIORS AND WORKING FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WITHOUT IT MANY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WOULD FURTHER STRUGGLE TO ACCESS QUALITY HEALTHCARE. HOWEVER IS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAM KEEN HAS REWARDED CERTAIN EXECUTIVES WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN BONUSES ON TOP OF THEIR SALARIES. AND I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAS BEEN AWARDED IN BONUS PAY TO MANAGEMENT AND NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE. ONE EXECUTIVE IS SAID TO HAVE RECEIVED A BONUS OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ON TOP OF A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUAL SALARY. GIVEN THAT THE MEDIUM AND CAN MEDIAN INCOME IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. IS. FIFTY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLARS A CONCERNS ME WHEN NONPROFIT HOSPITAL IS A WORDING AN EXECUTIVE A BONUS WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE AVERAGE LOCAL COMMUNITIES YEARLY SALARY. WHY CAN APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT TASK THAT THE HEALTH PLAN OF SOUND TEAM FACES AND PROVIDING NEEDED CARE? I'M ALSO REMINDED OF A LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE FROM NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT REPORTS THAT MEDI CAL HEALTH PLANS IN GENERAL. MADE FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION IN PROFITS DURING THE MEDICAID EXPANSION BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AND ACCORDING TO D. H. CSS DIRECTOR JENNIFER CAN AS QUOTED IN THE LA TIMES ARTICLE. HEALTH PLANS PROFITS WERE HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED DURING THE A CA EXPANSION. IT IS CLEAR THAT IT AUDIT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH HEALTH PLANS ARE COMPLYING WITH STATE AND FEDERAL STANDARDS. AND THE OVERSIGHT PROVIDED BY D. H. CS. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO BE AN EFFECTIVE STEWARD OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. I BELIEVE AND I WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO ALLEGATIONS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND SPIKED PAY THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION FOR THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVE THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IDEA OF ANY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST. OKAY CENA US. THE STATE AUDITOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS CENTER GALGIANI INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE WITH RESPECT TO MEDI CAL MANAGED HEALTHCARE PLANS SHE HAD SPECIFIED THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO LOOK AT THE. HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN BUT ALSO LOOK AT SOME OTHER PLANS AS WELL AS FAR AS. THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE PLANTS LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF AREAS WHAT WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT IS HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDING WITH RESPECT TO RATES ANY RATE ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDI CAL. PAYMENTS FOR MANAGED HEALTH CARE PLANS. THE QUALITY OF CARE MONITORING. THE PLANS AS FAR AS THEIR DELIVERY OF OF CARE AND HOPEFULLY THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF CARE AT AT THE VARIOUS FACILITIES. ARE AS THE SENATOR INDICATED WE WOULD BE EMPHASIZING. THE ANALYSIS IN LOOKING AT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THEIR OVERSIGHT WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL. PLANS MEDICAL H. M. O.'S INCLUDING THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN AND MEETING BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO STANDARDS OF CARE. I'M SHE SPECIFIED POSTPARTUM CARE IN DIABETES CARE BUT WOULD LOOK AT OTHERS AS WELL AND THEN THE LAST TWO OR THREE OBJECTIVES ARE REALLY LOOKING AT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. OUT WHAT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT IS HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDE WITH RESPECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. ANY BONUSES PAID TO EMPLOYEES WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND ALLOWABLE. AND THEN ALSO WHAT IS HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOING IN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH PLANS HOW TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT CONTROLS. TO PREVENT WASTE ABUSE ANY KIND OF MISMANAGEMENT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ARE REALLY LOOKING AT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND AND AND FOCUSING ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT IS TWENTY THREE HUNDRED HOURS RELATIVELY SMALL THAT WOULD TAKE US BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TWO WE HAVE. REPRESENTATIVES. FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES OR THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN JOAQUIN. IF WE DO PLEASE COME FORWARD. ALRIGHT WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM A. A DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES FIRST. THE MORNING MY NAME IS DAN RONAN LEGISLATIVE COORDINATOR WITH THE H. CS AM UNFORTUNATELY GOT DOUBLE BOOKED WITH A COUPLE BUDGET HEARINGS TODAY SO IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE INTO COMBAT THAT APARTMENT IN THE PROVIDE YOU WITH. WITH THE RESPONSE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I CHAU WE HAVE A MISSION. NOW WELCOME TO THE CAPITAL. LEAGUE WHICH LIKE TO MAKE STATEMENT. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MY NAME IS AMY CHEN AND THE CEO OF HEALTH PLAN THAT'S UNLOCKING IT. HELP US AND I CANCERS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. AND THAT ARE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IN SAN JOAQUIN STANISLAUS COUNTIES. AS A PUBLIC ENTITY WE ARE GOVERNED BY A PUBLIC COMMISSION. APPOINTED BY OUR LOCAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND THE PUBLIC COMMISSION IS SUBJECT TO BROWN ACTS OPEN MEETING RULES AND OPERATE WITH COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY. FIRST AND TO REQUEST A LARGE STATEWIDE AUDIT AND IS PREDICATE AND IT IT'S PREDICATED ON A SINGLE. LOCAL LABOR CONTRACT MATTER WITH A HEALTH PLAN. AS PRIOR TO THE UNIONIZATION ALL EMPLOYEES HAD AN INCENTIVE OR BONUS PROGRAM. AND AS PART OF THEIR TOTAL COMPENSATION. SECOND OUT WE THINK THIS AUDIT IS A LITTLE PREMATURE. WHAT WE LEARNED THAT HAVE SENATORS AND TEND TO REQUEST NOT IT WE MET WITH THE SENATOR? AND WE ACTUALLY AGREED WITH HER THAT EVERY DOLLAR MATTERS AND WE MUST ENSURE. PROPER FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC DOLLARS WE FOLLOWED UP WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE COUPLE TIMES SINCE THAT MEETING TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR THIS INFORMATION. BOAT AB AND NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER SANDERS OFFICE HAS TRIED TO GET ANSWERS BUT THESE ANSWERS. FROM THE H. CS BEFORE REQUESTING AN AUDIT. ADDITIONALLY A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REYES AND AUDIT REQUEST HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED. BY THE LEGISLATURE. FOR EXAMPLE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ON NOVEMBER NINTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WEIGHS LA TIMES ARTICLE REFERENCING QUESTION NUMBER ONE. OF THE AUDIT REQUEST. I'M PREPARED TO. ADDRESS ALL OTHER QUESTIONS OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT BUT OF COURSE GIVEN THE TIME LIMIT. I CAN DEFER TO THAT. COMMITTEES AND QUESTION PERIOD. AND THAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR IN QUESTION I'M EQUATED TO POINT OH SEVEN SIX PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL BUDGET. SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SMALL AMOUNT LIKE TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS THREE POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF FOR THAT HERE. AND THAT IS. AT COMPARED TO HEALTH NET WHICH IS OR COMPETITION COMPETITOR HEALTH PLAN AND THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS THERE THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. GIVEN AT WHATEVER FISCAL YEAR YOU LOOK AT. AND SO AND I. THINK AGAIN IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE AND AND AT BASED ON A LOCAL ISSUE. HOWEVER I WE ARE VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AND WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SANDERS REQUEST. AND SO IF THE REQUEST IS APPROVED WE WILL FULLY COOPERATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM EATING. SAN MIGUEL JOHNNY THE. THE YOUR LETTER AND TESTIMONY IS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OR. AYE IS BEEN REPORTED TO YOU ABOUT BONUSES. AND I THINK EVEN IF IT IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THAT OVERALL BUDGET THAT BONUS IS THE SIZE OF THE AVERAGE INCOME OF SOME OF THE REPRESENT IS WORTH. TAKING A LOOK AT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SENSITIVITY TO IT. BUT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO SHARE IT WAS A SOMETHING WAS REPORTED IN NEWS MEDIA OR HOW DID THAT INFORMATION COME FOR THAT IS FOUND IN THE BASIS FOR YOUR AUDIT. IT WASN'T THERE WAS A REPORT THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN AND HAD A HAD LISTED. ACTUAL BONUSES AND SALARIES SO WAS A REPORT OF INFORMATION AND THIS WAS WAS A SET PUBLIC REPORT. WAS IT CONDUCTED BY. I JUST AM SORT OF HIS IS ALREADY IN YOUR MATERIALS I DIDN'T SEE IT WHERE THE. WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE I'M? IF THIS IS AN AUDIT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE THE CAME UP WITH THE REPORT. OR WHERE BUT WAS THE BASIS FOR. THAT. AND SOME OF THE INFORMATION CAME FROM THE NEWSPAPER AND WE ALSO HAVE A WHISTLEBLOWER THAT CAME TO OUR OFFICE. WHO WAS NOT AN SEIU MEMBER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU? EVEN IF IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF AN OVERALL BUDGET. I THINK WHEN WHEN YOU SEE BONUSES OF THE AMOUNT THAT HAS BEEN INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR. IT IS WORTH TAKING EIGHT INDEPENDENT. AND VERY TRANSPARENT LOOK OUTSIDE PRESHEAF THERE WILL BE COOPERATION WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. BUT I THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE AVERAGE INCOME IS THE AMOUNT OF SOME OF THOSE BONUSES SO THANK YOU I JUST WONDER WHAT THE BASIS WAS FOR AND SEND THE AUDITOR OFF TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT. IN A RANDOM HEARSAY SAID THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS MATTER. I HAVE A GO ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR A MISSION. SO. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR PATIENTS ARE UP OR OR YOUR? MEMBERS FORTY PATIENTS ARE MEDI. MEDI CAL PATIENTS THE PROCESS UNDER PERCENT. SO. YEAH I I THINK A. I WOULD AGREE WITH THEM AS BAKER THAT. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PUBLIC DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WE DON'T GET ANY BONUSES AND. I I THINK OF NOR SHOULD WE. WE WE WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE GET TO WORK. THAT. YOU KNOW IMPORTANT PUBLIC PROGRAM I. I I'M I'M SURE. YEAH ASSUMING THAT EVERY EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING. IS IS IS TRUE AND CORRECT. PERHAPS THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT WILL EITHER CONFIRM OR DENY. ESTIMATES CONCERNS RAISED. BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS AUTUMN. I WOULD BE WORTHWHILE UMF CENTER GALGIANI WAS LIKE CLOSE. AM I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE THAT BILL MOTION BY MUCH RUBIO SECOND BY CENTER FULLER. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE.

CANNELLA AYE FULLER. FULLER AYE LARA. ALRIGHT THIS. REQUESTS HIS UNCLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING PATIENT. THIS ITEM WAS ORIGINALLY ON CONSENT BUT TO. IT WAS PULLED AT THE REQUEST OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND OUR CONNIE OF SAN DIEGO. AND THE VICE CHAIR. CONVEYING THAT REQUEST SO. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT OF THIS J. LACK REQUEST LAST YEAR MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW SAN DIEGO EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS A. AYE IN RECENT HISTORY AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE CREATION OF A VACCINE FOR THIS. DISEASE AS THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. IN FACT DECLARATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES WERE MADE BOTH BY THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND BY GOVERNOR BROWN AS THE DISEASE SPREAD FROM SAN DIEGO TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS LIKE SANTA CRUZ. AND LOS ANGELES AS OF MARCH TWENTY NINTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY REPORTEDLY FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN CASES FOUR HUNDRED TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS AND REGRETTABLY TWENTY DEATHS IN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO BECAUSE OF HEPATITIS A. THIS AUDIT IS SO VERY NECESSARY BECAUSE WE NEEDED INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF HOW THIS OUTBREAK WAS HANDLED BOTH BY THE CITY AND COUNTY OFSAN DIEGO. FOR EXAMPLE WE MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT CRITERIA WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE OUTBREAK THAT WAS NOW IN FACT A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN IT THAT DECLARATION WAS MADE AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. IT. IF THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF THAT DECLARATION A BY THE COUNTY THE STATE'S EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. GRANTEDTHE LOCAL THEM SAID THE TEMPORARY AUTHORITY TO ALLOW PARAMEDICS TO ADMINISTER DOSES OF VACCINE. THAT DECLARATION CAME IN THE EARLY FALL. AFTER. IT WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IS NOW BREAK IN MARCH THAT LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THAT DECORATE THE IDENTIFICATION AND DECLARATION COULD HAVE BEEN. IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF LIMITING THE LOSS OF LIFE AND SPECIALIST DISEASE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE MANY THINGS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW COULD HELPUS TO DETERMINE IF THE ACTIONS BY ALL PARTIES WERE CONSISTENT WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. AND BASS PRACTICES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OF THE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES AT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE WERE SPENT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS POSSIBLE. DECISIONS THE POWER WATCH SIDEWALKS ERECT TENTS NEED TO BE REVIEWED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE EXPENDITURES WERE WERE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING THE. SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE THE COUNTY REPORT JUST LAST WEEK THAT THEY HAVE NOW AT THIS POINT SPENT OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ON IN RESPONDING TO THIS OUTBREAK. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE VIEWS OF THE CITY AND COUNTY HAVE UNDER THEIR VIEWS OF THE CITY AND THE COUNTY HAVE UNDERGONE OF A CONTINUE TO UNDERGO. BUT THIS OUTBREAK HAS SPREAD TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THE STATE DECLARED AS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AYE AND WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW SEPARATE FROM THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I'D HOW CAN BE PREVENTED GOING FORWARD I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION IS REQUEST I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES ON THIS BOTTOMS CHEN. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. BUT RIGHT NOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M NANCY WHETHER SOME PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND WAS. ACTIVE IN THE NORTH COASTAL OCEAN SIDE REGION FOR DOING THE VACCINATION AND. ATTENDING TO THE OUTBREAK CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. OKAY. THE THE GREATEST CONCERN IS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE WAS THAT OF NO SAFETY PROTOCOL IN PLACE. EVEN AS THE OUTBREAK CAME TO AN END. IN MARCH OR APRIL. GOING OUT INTO THE ENCAMPMENTS UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR AGENCY TO PROTECT THE NURSES WAS PIE THE MOST GLARING OF. HOME IMPROPRIETIES THERE WERE NO SENTINEL EVENTS IN OUR OFFICE I'M SURE THEIR STORIES THAT COULD BE TOLD. WE DID HAVE SOME SOME. INTERESTING INTERACTIONS WITH THEM. THE NORTH COUNTY HOMELESS AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS. VERY KIND TO INFORM US AS TO THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE NORTH COUNTY HOMELESS POPULATION. VERSES AND THE CENTER CITY HOMELESS. SOME OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE BECAUSE OF THE. PREVALENCE OF MATH HOUSES AND GROWING. HOMES GROWING HOUSES IN NORTH COUNTY MOST OF THE HOMELESS ARE ARMED AND HOW. FELONY RECORDS FOR EITHER ARM PROPERTY ROBBERY OR ASSAULT. THE A RATIO OF GROW HOUSES IN NORTH COUNTY TO SAN DIEGO IS. MARGINALLY HIGHER BUT THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENT CRIMES AND ROBBING OR. CAUSING DISRUPTIONS TO THOSE TO THOSE FACILITIES IS MUCH HIGHER. NONE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE WENT OUT WITH COULD BELIEVE THAT WE WERE BEING SENT OUT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF. GUARD OR PRESENCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE WENT OUT OF MANY TIMES WITH ANCILLARY AGENCIES FOR MEDI CAL TO. ENROLL THE HOMELESS IN PROGRAMS THAT WERE ENTITLED TO. AND EVEN THOSE ARE STAFF MEMBERS WERE FITTED WITH SADDAM BALLISTIC GARMENTS TO PROTECT THEM IN CASE OF ANY KIND OF VIOLENT INTERACTION. THE NURSES WENT OUT AND ARE SCRUBS CARRYING OUR KIDS FULL OF SYRINGES AND. MEDICAL SUPPLIES MA'AM I CAN ASK YOU TO WRAP UP. YES I AM I THINK SAFETY PROTOCOL FOR THE COUNTY IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN EXPECT IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME SURE A CERTAINTY AND ASSURANCE THAT. ITEM WE WON'T BE. PLACED IN HARM'S WAY REGARDLESS OF THE OUTBREAK AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE HEPATITIS A THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. I THINK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JIM GROW SOME HALF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER THE COUNTY WANT TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR THE REQUEST YOU MADE FOR THE COUNTY TO APPEAR AND SPEAK ON THIS THANK OKAY I OR ANSWER ANY HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDIT REQUEST. NO AND I OKAY HE RESPONDING TALKING. HOLD ON A MINUTE LET'S OUR THANK YOU. STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA INDICATED THIS WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. AND WE HAVE TWO MAJOR OBJECTIVES ONE IS FOCUSING ON THE COUNTY'S RESPONSE THE OTHER ONE IS FOCUSING ON THE CITY'S RESPONSE SIMILAR OUR REQUIREMENTS I'M GONNA GO OVER THOSE AS A WHOLE SO I DON'T. TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME. CERTAINLY ASKING US. WHETHER IT'S THE CITY OR THE COUNTIES RESPONSE WHAT CRITERIA DID THEY USE TO DETERMINE THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES HOW DID THEY IDENTIFY. BASICALLY CONTAIN AND TREAT OUR INDIVIDUALS A. DURING THE OF HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK DID THEY FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS AND ANY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND AGAIN WILL BE DOING THIS BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. THE OTHER TWO OBJECTIVES AGAIN FOR BOTH IS COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE WITH RESPECT TO LOCATION DATA WHERE THESE CASES BEING IDENTIFIED IN WHAT LOCATIONS. POWER THEY COORDINATING WITH THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS IN THE LOCAL THE LOCAL REGIONS AND THEN WHAT LESSONS HAVE THEY LEARNED FROM THIS SITUATION. WHAT PROTOCOLS HAVE THEY PERHAPS MODIFIED OR STEPS THEY PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT A SIMILAR TYPE OF OUTBREAK FROM OCCURRING IN AN EXPANDING? IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LAST TWO OBJECTIVES. AS AS THE MEMBER INDICATED IS REALLY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT CONTRACTS THAT WERE APPROVED. BY THE CITY TO RESPOND TO THIS PARTICULAR EMERGENCY AND DID THOSE PROCESSES DIFFER FROM TYPICAL CONTRACTS THAT ARE AWARDED BY THE CITY. AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE THE CITY APPROVED THOSE FOLLOWING LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFIC POLICIES AND THEN THE LAST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY AGAIN ANOTHER LESSONS LEARNED AS FAR AS. WHETHER THE COUNTY. COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING SOONER. EARLIER IN MARCH AS AS THE MEMBER INDICATED RATHER THAN. THIS EMERGENCY BEING DECLARED AND IN SEPTEMBER OF OF SEVENTEEN. THE BUDGET FOR THE AUDIT RELATIVELY SMALL TWENTY TWO HUNDRED HOURS THAT WOULD TAKE MY STAFF'S TIME ABOUT FIVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW BEFORE WE. PROCEED TO THE RESPONDING AGENCIES LIKE I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT. THAT I REQUESTED THE YOU TO TESTIFY I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I DID NOT THAT. WE RISEN HAVE THIS ON CONSENT OF BUT THROUGH YOUR REQUEST THROUGH THE VICE YEAR. WE HAVE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT AND NOW YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. WELL I'M SORRY. THE LETTER ACTUALLY. COME FROM GLORIA. AND IN TERMS OF HIS REQUEST AND THEN A LETTER TO THE CHAU FROM. THIS COMMITTEE ASKING FOR ATTENDANCE. BOB I THINK THAT. WE WERE UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WANTED A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTY HERE. UP THEREFORE WE WERE SURPRISED WAS I CONSENT BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE AND. HAVING THE MATTER HEARD. IF THE COUNTY. RESPONSE TO THE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS QUICKLY BECAME ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY. WE BELIEVE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN CONTAINING THE OUT BREAK THROUGH A VARIETY OF EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES. YEAH I INCLUDING IMMUNIZING OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS BOTH COUNTY WORKERS AND COUNTY RESIDENTS. THAT BEING SAID. AS I'M SURE MR GLORIA WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE. ADDRESSING AN OUTBREAK OF THIS TYPE. AMONG THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT A SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO. TODAY ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE LIKE. ARE LESS SURE OF THAT. OBVIOUSLY THIS LEGISLATURE STRUGGLING WITH THE GENERAL ISSUE OF HOW DO WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ISSUES. INCLUDING A HEALTH ISSUES AND I'LL ADD HOUSING ISSUES IN THE LIKE SO THIS IS NOTHING NEW THAT THESE ARE NOT EASY ISSUES. I'D TO GRAPPLE WITH. I I THINK THAT. THE COUNTY REALLY BELIEVES THAT IT IS A LESSON TO LEARN. AYE IN THAT THIS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION. THEY'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CITY. THERE PROBABLY WAS SOME DUPLICATION OF OF EFFORT BUT A BOLT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD. I THINK THAT THE AFTER ACTION REPORT THAT ALL OF YOU RECEIVED A LINK TO THAT WAS PREPARED BY THE COUNTY ILLUSTRATES. THEIR EFFORTS IN GREAT DETAIL ILLUSTRATES THE PROGRESS. AND ALSO RAISES ISSUES OF ITS OWN ABOUT ITS PERFORMANCE AND HOW IT CAN IMPROVE. BOB BUT I THINK ALSO. IT HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT. ARE. THE COUNTY IS NOT THE ONLY ONE PROVIDING A REPORT. THE. AYE CIVIL GRAND JURY IN SAN DIEGO IS ABOUT TO ISSUE ITS OWN REPORT. ON. THIS CRISIS AND THE RESPONSE THERE TOO. UP WE KNOW HOW THOROUGH THE AUDITOR IS AND WE ASSUME THE AUDITOR WILL IN FACT LOOK AT BOTH ARE AFTER ACTION REPORT. AND THE GRAND JURY REPORT WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT REPORT. AND FROM THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GLEAN ARE A LOT OF INFORMATION WILL HELP ANSWER MISTER GLORIOUS QUESTIONS. AND PERHAPS REDUCE THE COST OF THE AUDIT AND ASK YOU YABBA FINALLY WE WE SENT SOME SKEPTICISM REGARDING THE COUNTY SPOTS A CRISIS. THE FACT IS THE COUNTY HAS BEEN LAUDED NATIONALLY FOR ITS EFFORTS AS I SAID WE WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM THIS. BUT WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO ASSUME THAT THIS WASN'T THE MOST ROBUST EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE. THE TIME TO GET TO. PROVIDERS LITTLE RESPONSE WE JOIN OUR COUNTY PARTNER. AND. NOT OBJECTING TO THIS AUDIT WHATSOEVER. BUT ALSO NOTING. NOT ONLY THE. THE AFTER ACTION REPORT THAT THE COUNTY PREPARED THAT WE THINK IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT. OF OF BOTH BY THE CITY AND COUNTY ACTIONS AND AND ROOMS FOR ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. WE IT'S A TWO HUNDRED PAGE REPORT IT'S IT'S A. IT'S THOROUGH WE TOO ARE PROVIDING OUR OWN OUR ASSESSMENT THAT. IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT RELEASED. DURING THE SUMMER SO WE WOULD COMMAND THE AUTHOR OF THE AUDITOR ONTO THAT REPORT AND HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH WITH HER AND HER STAFF. WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THEN ALSO JUST TO ECHO THE COUNTY'S COMMENTS. I THINK THAT ANYONE WHO. PRY NATIONWIDE KNEW HOW SERIOUS. THE EPIDEMIC WAS IN SAN DIEGO HOW SERIOUSLY WE TOOK IT. CITIES DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE HEALTH OFFICERS THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT'S JUST NOT UP AT A CITY FUNCTION THAT MOST CITIES HAVE. AND SO WE DID WE IT TOOK US. YOU KNOW A A HERCULEAN EFFORT TO RAMP UP AND REALLY JOIN WITH OUR PARTNERS NOT JUST AT THE COUNTY BUT AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS SO WE FEEL QUITE PROUD OF OF. OF WHAT WE DID KNOWING FULL WELL THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT AND PROBABLY A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM IT. BUT WE ABOUT WELCOME THE AUDITOR TO SUNNY SAN DIEGO WITH OUR CLEAN STREETS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER ON THE ON IT THINKING HER THANKS VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I M.. I HAVE THE. FIRST OF ALL A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE SOUNDS LIKE NOW THERE'S THIS THE AFTER ACTION REPORT. CITIES GOT ITS OWN ANALYSIS THEY'RE DOING. THE CIVIL GRAND JURY AND THEN THERE IS I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR THE COUNTY. LATER THIS SUMMER THAT'S ISSUING A REPORT. AND. AYE I'M GENTLE INCLINE TO SUPPORT THE ODD BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANT THOUGH. THAT WATER LESSONS LEARNED FOR ALL OF US TO GET IN ITS. FRANKLY SUMMIT ADMINISTRATIVELY EASIER IF WE GET FROM ONE INDEPENDENT SOURCE. BUT AND I'M LOOKING AT THAT TOWARDS THE BAY AREA WHERE THIS COULD HAVE SPREAD A WE HAVE WE HAVE A TRANSIT SYSTEM IN THE BAY AREA THAT IS JUST. REALLY A MAJOR SANITATION PROBLEM AND TOP OF HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER ISSUES SO I I'M I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT BUT WHEN I HEAR THERE ARE FOUR OTHER STUDIES AND REPORTS GOING ON. BEFORE WE SET THE AUDITOR TO DO IT AND WHEN THE AUDITOR GOES INTO COUNTY AND CITY THEY ARE GOING TO BE. THE OFFICE IS GOING TO BE NEED TO INTERACT WITH I WANNA SEE DISTRACT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING WHICH CAN TAKE. CITY AND COUNTY TIME. AS YOU PUT HAVE YOU PUT THOUGHT TO. THE TIMING OF THIS BEING NECESSARY. MAY BE. POSTPONING UNTIL THE OTHER FOUR REPORTS COME OUT ADD TO SEE WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO UTILIZE OUR OUR RESOURCES ON THIS. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IS BAKER AND I WOULD NOTE THAT BOTH THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE NOT OBJECTING TO THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST TODAY. AND I SHARE AND I'M APPRECIATE YOU UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR THE AUDIT BECAUSE YES THIS COULD HAPPEN YOUR DISTRICT TO. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE SHOULD ARMY WAS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE YOU AMY KNEW I REQUEST BY THE WAY FOR THE NEXT HEARING WE HAVE SAID THANK YOU. SO WITH REGARD TO TIMING OF THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT A MISTAKE I HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU DURING THE MIDST OF THIS CRISIS THERE WAS A LOT OF FINGER POINTING THAT HAPPENED. AND WE ALL MADE AGREEMENT AT THE TIME TO SORT OF SET THAT STUFF ASIDE AND RESPOND TO THIS IS GRASSLEY'S POSSIBLE. AND THEN COME BACK TO IT AFTER THAT MARKETS HE HAS PASSED EMERGENCY HAS PASSED THE DECLARATION HAS BEEN REMOVED. AND AFTER ACTIONS ARE HAPPENING BUT I THINK PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WAS MISS A TOP WAS MENTIONING THE CITY THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. THERE BEEN A MULTITUDE OF THE COMMENTS THAT I THINK REALLY. MAKE THE STATE'S AUDITING OF THIS A VERY IMPORTANT UM THE IN THE STATE IS A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT REVIEWER OF THIS IT IS NOT EITHER THE ACTORS THAT WERE INVOLVED THE IMMEDIATE. RESPONSE AND I THINK AS A RESULT HAS ADDED A. HEIGHTENED CREDIBILITY THAT CAN HELP REALLY AGAIN BRING OUT THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT ARE IMPORTANT FROM THIS AND REALLY SPEAK. FOR WHAT I THINK MAY BE A NEW NORMAL GOING FORWARD BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT THE VALUE HERE IS A THIRD PARTY THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY RESPONSE FOR WHICH FOR QUESTIONING. AND I THINK THAT KIND OF IMPARTIALITY. IS VALUABLE THANK YOU AND THEN IT DOES BRING ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION THE OTTERS HIS HOW CAN IT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO STRUCTURE. THAT HOW YOU DEPLOY YOUR RESOURCES THE TIMING OF HOW YOU DO THIS GIVEN THAT THERE ARE ME I WOULD REALLY WANT YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ALL THESE OTHER REPORTS RATHER THAN ON A PARALLEL TRACK. KNOWING THAT ONE IS EXPECTED OUT IN JULY JUST A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW THINK THE CITY MENTION THEY'RE DOING WIND IT'S COMING SEPTEMBER. SUMMER SKEWS ME AM. IS IT WITHOUT WANTING TO DELAY BECAUSE I DO WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS I I APPRECIATE THE POINT MISTER COLOR MAKES THAT THIS IS A. AN INDEPENDENT THE DIDN'T HAVE A. THE A FINGER POINTED OUT AT THE STATE OR THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE BUT HOW WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE. THE BEST WAY TO DEPLOY YOUR RESOURCES GIVEN THE. OTHER REPORTS ARE COMING OUT. RIGHT THANK YOU MS BAKER UP WE ABSOLUTELY WOULD WANT TO TIME OUR WORK NOT BASED ON SOME OF THESE REPORTS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS AFTER ACTION REPORTS VERY COMPREHENSIVE THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE WHAT STAFF WOULD START WITH. IS LOOKING AT THAT WE WE ALSO HAVE AN AUDIT WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING. OFFER CENTER KOISO ON PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND THE STAFFING AND ONE OF THE ELEMENTS HE ASKED US TO LOOK AT WITH STAFFING RELATED TO THE HAVE BAY OUTBREAK SO WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT WE'VE CLEAN FROM THAT AUDIT. BUT CERTAINLY AN AUDIT OR AT A REPORT THAT'S COMING OUT IN JULY THAT'S A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW THAT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT ONCE IT COMES OUT. WE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT IF THERE'S INFORMATION THAT'S IN DRAFT I WOULD ASSUME WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT NOW. THE CITY WOULD COOPERATE IN HAVE. I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN THE ASSURANCE FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES HERE SO WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION LOOK AT THE SUPPORT BEHIND IT SO THAT WE ARE DUPLICATING EFFORT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT LOOK AT IT FROM WITH A CRITICAL EYE. SO ABSOLUTELY ANY OF THIS INFORMATION WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO US AND HOPEFULLY TO THE EXTENT WE CANRELY ON THAT INFORMATION IT'LL CUT BACK THE NUMBER OF HOURS WE HAVE TO INVEST IN HOW MUCH THIS AUDIT WILL COST I HOPE SO AND I THINK. EVEN HAVING A CIVIL GRAND JURY LOOKING AT THIS MEAN THEY'RE FAIRLY INDEPENDENT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OF EARLY INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT. IS TIMES WHEN THAT'S COMING OUT BUT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO TO LOOK AT AS WELL WITHOUT REINVENTING. THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING OF JUST TWO MORE QUICK ONES BAKER CAN I JUST LOOK TWO BITS OF INFORMATION MY UNDERSTAND IS THE THE THE GRAND JURY REPORT IS. THURSDAY I'M AND I WOULD POINT OUT THE GRAND JURY. HIS FUNDED HOUSE WITHIN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THE AUTHOR HAS. AVAILABLE NOR SOME OF THAT SUBPOENA POWER TO SUBMIT THAT I'M ACCESSING OF OF MORE CONFIDENTIAL DOT. THAT THAT MAY BE THINKING THAT MAYBE THE CASE I I KNOW I'M HOW WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE A CIVIL GRANGER IT'S A THANKLESS TASK AND AND IT DOES. HAVE TO DO A LOT OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK. AM I DO WANNA ALSO THIS I GUESS IS FOR THE AUDITOR BUT ALL THIS TO BE MINDFUL OF WHEN A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HAPPENS. AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO DO BOTH AFTER ACTION AND WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER TO PREVENT IT AGAIN AND. AND HAVE A BETTER RESPONSE IF FUTURE THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF HINDSIGHT. AND I I KNOW YOU CAN'T INCORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR REPORT I KNOW THAT WHATEVER PART YOU HAVE I FOR ONE WILL BE LOOKING THAT WERE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BE HAVING THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A CONTRACT THIS WAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WAY BUT THIS WAS A VERY TENSE TIME AND A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH. ISSUE. I THINK IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE A CAUTION FOR US THAT WE ARE JUST GOING TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT HAPPENS IN HINDSIGHT WHEN THERE'S BEEN AN AN URGENCY. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A QUESTION BUT I DO HAVE ONE FOR YOU. MANY OF THE ISSUES. THAT I OR QUESTIONS ARE RAISED IN THE AUDIT. OF ALL GOOD ONES. TO ME LOOK VERY MUCH DIRECTED SO MUCH WHERE THE COUNTY WOULD TRADITIONALLY BE AN AUTHORITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS YOU SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF MANY SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE FOR EITHER FUNDED BY THE STATE OR SEPARATELY. AND LESS SO THE CITY AND YET THE AUDIT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SORT OF EQUAL I WAS EQUAL TIME BUT IT WILL FOCUS ON THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. I I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY THE AUDITOR LOOKS AT THIS KNOWING THAT MOST COUNTIES ARE NOT. ARE ARE THAT MORE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL FOR REGION AND NOT SO MUCH A CITY. I CAN GIVE YOU JUST SORT OF SAY HOW YOU MIGHT ALLOCATE YOUR RESOURCES ON THAT OR. MAKING SURE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON WHERE IT'S FAIR I MEAN FRANKLY THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS AS A LONG TERM. ESTABLISHED PROGRAM. TO RESPOND TO A CRISIS LIKE THIS. THANK YOU MS BAKER. AT WITH ANY AUDIT WHEN WE GET IN THERE THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE AUDIT FIRST TWO WEEKS ESSENTIALLY STAFFER GOING OUT SO THEY WOULD BE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO MEETING WITH CITY OFFICIALS MEETING WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS. AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TO US AND SAY YOU KNOW MOST OF THE EFFORT A RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT COUNTY LEVEL SO WE REALLY NEED TO SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME. ON THOSE PARTICULAR QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBER ASKED WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK AT THE CITY BUT NOT AS MUCH WE'RE GONNA PARROT BACK SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COURSE CORRECT DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT USUALLY THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS SEVEN ON IT. IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE STAFFER OUT IN THE PARTICULAR ENTITY IN THIS CASE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO ARE TALKING TO OFFICIALS LOOKING AT THE AFTER ACTION REPORT. HOPEFULLY LOOKING AT SOME DRAFT INFORMATION IF THE GRAND JURY REPORT IS OUT A LOOKING AT THAT MAY BE TALKING WITH SOME OF THE YEAH. MEMBERS WHO SERVED ON THE GRAND JURY BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY ABLE TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT WE PUT. INTO SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES BASED ON WHAT STAFF LEARNED DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF AN AUDIT OKAY AND THE BE VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT. WE CAN DIRECT EVERY DETAIL THAT HOW YOU DO THIS BUT JUST BE MINDFUL AS YOU GO ALONG. WHERE WHO WHO IS ULTIMATELY MORE RESPONSIBLE WHO HAS THE RESOURCES TO DO IT I WILL LOOK FOR TO THE REPORT? KNOWING THAT HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY AND AND HOPE THAT I WILL NEVER HAVE TO ASK FOR AN AUDIT OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE BAY AREA. BECAUSE WILL LEARN FROM THIS TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SOME OF HER WORK JUST A COMMENT I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT'S. I I UNDERSTAND THAT WERE ON THE SPEAKERS COMING FROM. FOR HER PERSPECTIVE BUT I'LL TELL YOU FROM SOMEONE WHO JUST EXPERIENCED A PRETTY MAJOR NATURAL DISASTER IN MY DISTRICT. WE'RE LOOKING REALLY CLOSELY AT EVERYTHING AT THE CITY LEVEL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AROUND EMERGENCY WARNINGS AND AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN THERE SO SO WE'RE DOING THIS IN THE SPIRIT OF HOW DO WE. ENSURE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN FOR EVERYONE AND I KNOW THAT'S THE SPIRIT IN WHICH YOU BRING THIS FOR AND I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND I LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING SADDAM. TAKING IN THE FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM ANYONE IN THE. AUDIENCE LIKE TO COMMENT. SEEING NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FOR. THE REQUEST. DIED. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE. SOME OF THE CONCERNS. ABOUT. THE THE AFTER REPORT IN THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION. BUT. WE ARE. RESPECT YOU AND RESPECT THAT YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR YEAR YOUR DISTRICT IN MEAN AND ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS REQUEST DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS HUTTON PROCEDURE SUPPORT AS CHAIRMAN AND IT PUT IT ON CONSENT. AND I WOULD JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE NEED TWENTY PEOPLE DIED OF FROM THIS OUTBREAK. AND WHILE I'M THEY WERE HOMELESS. THEIR LIVES ARE NO LESS VALUABLE. THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE STATE. AND BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME HOUSE HOMELESS AND HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE IN THE STATE I FEAR THAT THIS MAY HAPPEN AGAIN WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS STUDY IT CLOSELY REPORT ON IT. APPARENTLY I'M THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE IS DOING THAT WITH ANY CREDIBILITY IS TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO HAVE A MOTION OKAY AND MAKE THE MOTION. MOTION BY RUBIO SECOND BY FULLER THIRD BY THE WAY. ROLL CALL PLEASE. ROLL CALL TO APPROVE ITEM NUMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TASH ONE ONE SIX OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK. THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND I VOTES ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERCY CHANGE MERCY CHI AYE ACOSTA. BAKER BAKER AYE NAZARIAN OBERNOLTE. RUBIO. RUBIO I WEIGHED. WOULD I. SENATOR RAW. ALLEN BELL CANNELLA. CANNELLA AYE FULLER. FULLER AYE LARA. THE A RATE WE ARE SHORT TO SENATE VOTES THE. REQUESTED SOKOL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WOULD AND OR SOME OF OUR WOULDN'T SARAH CANNELLA. TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. OUR REQUESTS. TO AUDIT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES RELATED TO MEDI CAL CHILDREN'S ACCESS SOME PREVENTIVE CARE. DID YOU SAY THE COOL PEOPLE UP THERE THAT SHE SAYS AND. HOW I SEE IT? ALRIGHT. IT'S A VERY NICE MUG YOU HAVE THERE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD ACTS OR EQUAL TIME MISTER CHAIR FOR MY TEAM. THE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THAT PROUD TO PRESENT THIS AUDIT ARTISTS ARE. ADDED TO REQUEST BEFORE YOU. MEDI CAL IS THE CORNERSTONE OF HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WITH NEARLY THREE OUT OF EVERY FIVE. CHILDREN THE STATE BEING COVERED UNDER MEDICARE. MEDICARE PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE INCLUDING REGULAR AND WELL CHILD VISITS AND DEVELOPMENTAL AND OTHER HEALTH SCREENINGS. UNFORTUNATELY COMES ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL PERFORM IN THE LOWEST QUARTILE OF ALL STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS. LIKEWISE IN REGARDS TO PERIODIC CHILDHOOD SCREENINGS MEDICAL PERFORMS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR EACH AGE GROUP. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING ENFORCING AND REPORTING THAT MEDI CAL DELIVERS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES MOST MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE NON URGENT PRIMARY CARE TO APPOINTMENTS WITHIN TEN DAYS. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT THESE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS ARE NOT BEING MET. THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN SECRET SHOPPER SURVEY OF MEDI CAL PEDIATRIC APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY FOUND THAT ONLY ONE THIRD OF ATTEMPTED CALLS FOR IN PEDIATRIC WELL CHILD APPOINTMENT RESULTED IN AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN THE TEN DAY. TIMELY ACCESS STANDARD INITIALLY ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE CALL ATTEMPTS WERE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY APPOINTMENT DO TWO PROVIDERS. TO TO KNOW PROVIDED FROM THE PLAN'S PROVIDER LIST ACCEPTING NEW MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED AUDIT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS PROPELLING ITS MANDATE AND EVALUATE HOW PLAY HOW WELL PLANS ARE DOING IN MEETING THE GOAL THAT CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. RECEIVED A TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. THROUGH THE AUDIT. THROUGH THE SIDE IT WE CAN OBTAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE AND IDENTITY. AND I DON'T. AND IDENTIFY WHAT AREAS MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FOCUS AND INVESTMENT. HERE TESTIFYING SUPPORT ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS MICHAEL O'DAY A DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY FOR CHILDREN NOW. EXACTLY WHAT GOOD MORNING GERMAN HEART SURGEON MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE I'M MICHAEL DAY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY CHILDREN NOW AND ON BEHALF OF SEVERAL OF OUR ADVOCACY PARTNERS REPRESENTING HEALTH CONSUMERS. FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEDI CAL CHILDREN'S ACCESS AUDIT. MAKEUP PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR ROUGHLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S KIDS MAKING IT THE KEY SOURCE OF PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE FOR UPWARDS OF FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION KIDS. AND MAKING IT THE CORNERSTONE OF HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA'S KIDS IN THE STATE. THIS OVERSIGHT AUDIT REQUESTED BY DOCTOR WOULDN'T SENATOR CANNELLA IS CRITICAL TO HELP POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. UNDERSTAND HOW WELL CALIFORNIA IS FULFILLING ITS MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. FOR FIFTY YEARS FEDERAL MEDICAID LIES REQUIRED STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO ACTIVELY PROMOTE ENSURE THAT CHILDREN UNDER TWENTY ONE RECEIVED ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. UNDER THE IMPORTANT EARLY PERIODIC DIE SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT BENEFIT EPS DUTY. TODAY THESE INCLUDE THE PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT ARE CLINICALLY RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS BRIGHT FUTURES PERIODICITY SCHEDULE AND GUIDELINES. THESE ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND WELL CHILD VISITS WHICH INCLUDE PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES LIKE IMMUNIZATIONS AND SCREENINGS OUR KEEPER CHILDREN'S HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT AND ADD EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. AS THE LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY MEDICAL SERVES MORE CHILDREN THAN ANY OTHER STATE BUT DATA SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND MOST OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION. AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON TWENTY SIXTEEN STANDARDIZED DATA CALIFORNIA PERFORMS IN THE LOWEST QUARTILE OF ALL STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE. MORE THINGS MAY BE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THE RATE OF YOUNG CHILDREN AGES THREE TO SIX WITH A WELL CHILD VISIT HAS CONSISTENTLY DECLINED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND UNLIKE FORTY SIX OTHER STATES THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOES NOT PUBLICLY REPORT ON THE RATE OF WELL CHILD VISITS FOR INFANTS OR FOR ADOLESCENTS. CHILDREN NEED TIMELY ACCESS TO PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES AND SCREENINGS NEEDED FOR HEALTHY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN LINE WITH THE EP STT BENEFIT. STATUTORY CONTRACTUAL STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT CHILDREN MEDI CAL CAN GET A NON URGENT PRIMARY CARE POINT ME WITHIN TEN DAYS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT NEW FEDERAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE RULES WILL REQUIRE NEW TIMELY ACCESS MONITORING PROCESS. BEGINNING IN JULY OF THIS YEAR A FUNCTION THAT IS NEW TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY CURRENT OFFICIALS STATED ON COMPLIANCE WITH TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MEDICAL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES CAN AND DO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FINING PEDIATRIC PAYMENTS WITHIN TEN DAYS OR SOMETIMES AT ALL. THE TROUBLING DATA OR LACK THERE OF AROUND CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO CARE RAISE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA IS FULFILLING ITS OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. THIS AUDIT WILL HELP STAKEHOLDERS A POLICYMAKERS UNDERSTAND WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING NOW AND SHOULD BE DOING TO REMEDY THE REMEDY THESE DEFICIENCIES TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF DR WOULDN'T SENATOR CANNELLA IN REQUESTING THIS AUDIT TO ENSURE CHILDREN'S NEEDS ARE MET AND I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CNN. STATE AUDITOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD INDICATED THIS WOULD BE AN AUDIT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES REALLY FOCUSING ON PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. FIRST LOOKING AT THE EFFORTS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AYE HAS MADE TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ARE ARE BEING PROVIDED A RECEIVING PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. ARE WHETHER OR NOT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS MONITORING AND ENFORCING THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS OFF FOR PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE CARE APPOINTMENTS ALSO LOOKING AT. CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND MAKING SURE THAT GUIDANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING. ENSURES THAT PLANS UNDERSTAND OR PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TIMELY ACCESS. AND DELIVERY OF PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES ALSO AGAIN WHAT IS HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOING TO OVERSEE AND MONITOR. THAT PARTICULAR INFORMATION ALSO THAT TWO MEMBERS OF CENTER CANNELLA AS WELL HAVE ASKED US TO LOOK AT INCENTIVES OR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. PROGRAMS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES OPERATES. AND HOW DOES HAVE A LEAD TO ANY ADDRESS ANY DEFICIENCIES WITH RESPECT TO NOT ONLY ACCESS TO CARE BUT UTILIZATION AS AS HIS WITNESS INDICATED. ALSO A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY OFFER FAMILIES THAT. SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN ENGLISH OUT EITHER THE CHILD OR THE PARENTS OUT WHAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE THEY IN DOING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES IN PARTICULAR FOR THE CHILDREN. AND THEN. WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING TO MODERN MITIGATE ANY DISPARITIES WITH RESPECT TO ETHNICITY AND RACE AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE AND UTILIZATION? AND THEN THE FINAL. ISSUES ASKING US TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE ARE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN BE DOING TO STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO CARE AND UTILIZATION. AND THEN FINALLY TO LOOK TO DETERMINE WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS DONE TO PREPARE FOR THE UPCOMING CHANGES ARE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM I WITH RESPECT AGAIN TO P. ACTOR CARE ACCESS UTILIZATION. THE AUDITS BUDGETED ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOURS SO AN AUDIT OF THAT SIZE WILL TAKE US A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE STAFF TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. FORGOT TO ASK THE SERVER CANNELLA WHICH YOU WOULDN'T DO YOU HAVE ANY STATEMENT IT HAS A COVERT QUESTOR AB APPRECIATE BEING A CO AUTHOR DOCTOR WHAT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA WITH THE DENTAL PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK. THE PROGRAM IN ITS ENTIRETY MEAN THESE KIDS RELY ON THIS AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CANCEL. APPRECIATE UP TO SPEED ALRIGHT THANK YOU A I SEE. LIVE SECOND IRATE AG. DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WASN'T ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR GIVEN THE. BIPARTISAN REQUEST YOUR VITA. DO WE HAVE ANYONE FROM THE AFFECTED AGENCY HERE. PLEASE COME FOR.

SEEING NONE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD WHICH LIFE CLOSED YES A PROVIDE LIKE THE SAM HONORED TO BE JOINED BY SENATOR CANNELLA IN THIS AS A AS MY JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS. A BIT ALSO JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW THAT WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN I COME FROM OF A PROFESSION THAT THAT IS FOCUSED ON PREVENTION. VALUE YOU YOU INTERVENE EARLY YOU PROVIDE BASIC PREVENTIVE CARE SUCH YOU KNOW HAVE MORE CATASTROPHIC MORE EXPENSIVE COSTS INCURRED LATER ON. IT'S REALLY DISTURBING THAT FOR FOR WHATEVER REASON IT APPEARS THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO THIS PREVENTIVE CARE. AND THAT IS GOING TO. HAS TO LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS ON THE OTHER AND SO WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND HOW WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WAVE MOTION AND SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE.

WERE REQUESTING A THORNY TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO. AS YOU ARE UNSURE WHERE WE HAVE A LOCAL HIGH RISK PROGRAM WHERE WE USE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION PRIMARILY INFORMATION THAT'S REPORTED UP TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. ALSO LOOKING AT GRAND JURY REPORTS ANY OTHER UP. PUBLIC OUR INFORMATION AND SOME CASES IT'S MEDIA INFORMATION BUT BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT MY STAFF DID OF THE FINANCIAL OUR RECORDS FOR THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO WE HAD SOME PRETTY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR. FINANCIAL CONDITION. THEY'RE FORECASTING LOOKING AT THEIR BUDGETING PRACTICES. AND AND HAVING GONE THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS. WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING THIS AUDIT REQUEST TO THE COMMITTEE SO I'LL QUICKLY STEPPED THROUGH THE THE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES ARE AND LOOKING AT THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO ONE ISSUE THAT WE WANT. PICTURE. OPERATION. OF THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT. SEVERAL ACTIVITY OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ENTERPRISES. TRANSIT AUTHORITY THEIR WATER. DISTRICT AND THE COUGH COURSE WHERE THEY'RE LOSING MONEY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN HAVING TO BE. USING FUNDS FROM THE GENERAL FUND THE GENERAL FUND IS LOANING. DOLLARS TO THESE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES IN THIS IS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS SO A ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO TRY TO ENGAGE WITH THE CITY IS. HOW ARE THEY DEALING WITH THESE INTER FUND DAHLE LOANS? WHAT IS THEIR FUTURE PLANS TO TRY TO MITIGATE OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF? DOLLARS THAT NEED TO BE BORROWED FROM THE GENERAL FUND THEY ALSO HAVE SOME IN INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES RELATED TO THEIR THEIR WATER UTILITY DO THEY HAVE PLANS FOR ADDRESSING THAT IN THE LONG TERM. I AM LOOKING AT THEIR BUDGETING PRACTICES. WE REALLY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO REVENUE THEY HAVE ONE HOTEL WHERE THEY'VE HAD. HIGH PROJECTIONS AS FAR AS REVENUE BUT THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN REALIZED NOW THEIR PROJECTIONS FOR REVENUE. HOTEL THAT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT BUT BASED ON THE HISTORY OF THE EXISTING HOTEL WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT REVENUE WILL ACTUALLY BE REALIZED AND IF IT ISN'T REALIZE WHAT WILL MONTEBELLO INTENDED TO. A TO ADDRESS THAT SITUATION. UNDER OUR HIGH RISK PROGRAM WE CURRENTLY CURRENTLY IN OUR REGULATIONS HAVE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT ASSESSING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND THE CITY'S ABILITY ANY CITY'S ABILITY TO PAY. LOCATIONS BOTH ON A SHORT TERM BASIS AND A LONG TERM BASIS WE ALSO LOOK AT AUDITS THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO GO INTO CITIES. THE LAST TIME THEY WENT INTO THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO WAS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SO WE WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE MADE TO SEE WHAT MONTEBELLO HAS DONE TO. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THERE WERE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INTERNAL PATROLS AT CETERA. AND THEN THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ALSO REYES RELATED TO CONTRACTING PRACTICES FATHER PROCUREMENT POLICIES ARE THEY GETTING THE BEST VALUE AGAIN ARE THEY. BEING FISCAL STEWARDS OF. THE FINANCES FOR THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO WE BUDGETED THIS AUDIT ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AS I SAID WE'VE ALREADY DONE SOME PRELIMINARY WORK.

LINDA STRONG LONG TIME RESIDENT OF MONTEBELLO. UP FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE MONOPOLE BUDGET HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN BALANCED WITH ONE TIME MONEY. REPEATED REPEATED SALES OF CITY. A LONG TERM LEASES WITH A LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE CITY WAS SOMEHOW FUNCTIONING AS A REGULAR CITY. THERE'S ALSO BEEN MULTIPLE MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH CONTRACTS NUMEROUS CONTRACTS WITH OUT REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS OTHERS VERY SHORTENED REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL TIME LIMITS MYSTERIOUSLY OVER AND OVER WE JUST ONE BIT IS BEING MADE. SO THERE'S LIKE THEY DON'T THEN THEY REFUSE TO REBUILD IT TO PUT IT OUT AGAIN. WE'VE HAD CONTRACT EXTENSIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR INCLUDED IN ONE CASE A CONTRACT EXTENDED A DAY AFTER IT HAD ALREADY EXPIRED. CONTRACTS ARE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IN THIS CITY THERE APPEARS TO BE ALL SORTS OF INSTANCES OF FAVORITISM AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE AUDIT WILL ADDRESS CONTRACTS THANK YOU. Q.. GOOD MORNING A MY NAME IS LINDA NICHOLAS AND WITH A GROUP CALLED MATCH MONTEBELLO ACTIVISTS TO CLEAN HOUSE. WE HAD A FORMER CELLS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR CITY. THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING BEFORE YOU ARE ABLE CHAIR COMMITTEE. AGAIN AYE AYE A CONCUR WITH A FOR THE FOR THAT THE. PREVIOUS SPEAKER CONTRACTS ARE A HUGE ISSUE FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE FAVORED. ARE GIVING EXAMPLE. THE HOTEL THAT THE AUDITOR MENTIONED. H. TWO SUITES WAS AWARDED TO OUR MAYOR SPREAD THIS EMPLOYER. A COMPETITIVE BID A WAS NOT DONE. IT WAS THAT GIVEN A THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT WAS AWARDED INTENDED AS. WHAT COMPETITORS WHAT CAN COMPETENT? BUSINESS CAN MAKE A BUSINESS PROPOSAL FOR THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT IN TEN DAYS THAT'S UNHEARD OF. AND WE HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE A TIRE COMPANY. IT WAS GIVEN OUT IN HIS IT IS CONTRACT HAD EXPIRED BE EXTENDED IT. AND THEY GAVE HIM A THREE PERCENT INTERESTS. INCREASE TO GIVE HIS EMPLOYEES A RAISE. THAT'S UNHEARD OF BUT THEY AWARDED IT. I'VE GIVEN YOU COPIES OF INFRASTRUCTURE NOW THAT COMPANY. IS AN ENGINEERING THAT DOES ALL OUR ENGINEERING WORK. ON ONE OF THE FORMS OF SEE WHERE IT SAYS OUR CITY IS WAVING. THE BIDDING PRACTICE OF FROM FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT AND YOU GOT IT WAS HONORED JENDA. THEY ALSO GONNA GIVE THEM. THEY WANTED TO BELIEVE IN SPEAKING UP.

THERE ENGINEERS WHAT BUSINESS THEY HAVE. BUT THEN WE FOUND OUT ON THEIR NEWSLETTER THEY'RE NOT PROMOTING THEMSELVES AS THE GOLD RUSH AND A STRIKE TEAM FOR POT CULTIVATION.

THE HIGH RISK AUDIT REQUESTS FOR THE CITY OF ATWATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. WE'RE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE CITY OF ATWATER OH BASED ON SOME OF OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT WORK WE DID AND LOOKING AT NOT ONLY. INFORMATION THAT'S REPORTED TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BUT IN AUDIT THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER CONDUCTED A BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE SIMILAR TO TO WHAT I REFERRED TO IN MY PRIOR PRESENTATION. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE CITY OF ATWATER AND WE'VE NOTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF THE ATWATER GENERAL FUND BALANCE. HAS DROPPED FROM A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. RESERVE TO ADD THEIR IN A DEFICIT SITUATION. HAVE ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GENERAL FUND HAS. BASICALLY THERE RESERVE HAS BEEN DEPLETED IN ADDITION TO THAT AND THE COMPTROLLER'S REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE CONTROLLER IDENTIFIED ISSUES WHERE THEY WERE USING GENERAL FUND MONEY ARTS UP MONEY FROM OTHER FUNDS. TO COVER GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. THEY'VE CONTROLLER RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THOSE PROCESSES. WORKED ATWATER RETRO LACK RETROACTIVELY APPROVED SOME LOANS TO THE GENERAL TO THE GENERAL FUND FROM THE WATER AND SANITATION FINES BUT IT WAS UNCLEAR AS TO. THE REPAYMENT TERMS AND AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED BUT A BIGGER ISSUE IS LOOKING OUT THE FINANCIAL FORECASTING THEIR GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES ARE TYPICALLY EXCEEDING THEIR REVENUE. AND THE LAST TEN OUT OF ELEVEN YEARS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THERE WAS AN EXCESS OF EXPENDITURES OVER ANOTHER REVENUE COMING IN. AS MANY CITIES ARE FACING OUR RETIREMENT. COSTS FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS OUGHT BOTH A REGULAR RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND A POST EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS YOUR MAN HEALTH AND MEDICAL. WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT WHAT THE CITY OF THAT WATER IS DOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN. THEY HAVE WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE MADE SOME ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THEIR DEFICITS UP BUT AGAIN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TREND. OF THE EXPENDITURES ARE CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDING THEIR THEIR REVENUES THEY HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER IN THEIR MANAGEMENT GROUP THEY'VE HAD SEVEN CITY MANAGERS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SOME INTERIM CITY MANAGERS. SO WITH THAT WITH ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS WE PUT TOGETHER A SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS REALLY WANTING TO LOOK AT THEIR FINANCIAL POSITION. THEIR ABILITY TO MEET NOT ONLY THEIR SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS BUT LONG TERM FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS A WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO REPAY THE CENTER FUND LOANS WHAT'S THEIR PROCESS WHAT'S THEIR INTENT TO DO THAT. POWER THEY ADDRESSING SOME OF THEIR PENSION OBLIGATIONS MOVING FORWARD. THEIR PROCESS FOR SETTING UTILITY RATES WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT AGAIN LOOKING AT THE COMPTROLLER'S REPORT WHAT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE THEY TAKEN. IN RESPONSE TO THE TWENTY FOURTEEN REPORT ISSUED BY THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT EFFORTS THEY'VE TAKEN TO FILL SOME OF THESE KEY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. THE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THAT THEY NEED TO TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF CONTINUITY ON THEIR OPERATIONS AYE AYES AYE INDICATED THE BUDGET FOR THIS AUDIT IS ABOUT A LITTLE OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. THAT WOULD TAKE US. BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE REP CENTER FROM THE CITY OF ATWATER. PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS LAURIE WATERMAN CITY MANAGER ATWATER I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AYE REGARDING OUR ITEM THIS MORNING AND I'LL DEFER MY TIME TO ATTORNEY LIKE. I WAS CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS DOUG WHITE I'M WITH THE LAW FIRM OF CHURCH WHAT WHITE IN THE CONTRACT CITY ATTORNEY FOR. THE CITY ABOUT WATER I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA WE REPRESENT FIVE OR SIX OTHER CITIES AS WELL SPECIAL JURISDICTIONS US. OUR SPECIAL IN THEM. AGENCIES OVER THERE. IN IN THE AREA AND. RECENTLY CAME ON BOARD THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TURNOVER IN THE CITY OF ATWATER TO MOSTLY BEEN DUE TO THE USE OF RETIRED ANNUITANTS. AND OTHER REASONS BUT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE WITH THE. PLAN THAT GENTLEMAN WHO ARE JUST PREVIOUSLY WORKED WITH THIS WASN'T A NEW ONE. TO GET TO TAKE REALLY PROACTIVE MEASURE SO THE THREAT OF THE AUDIT HAS DONE ITS INTENDED EFFECT WHICH IS TO HAVE OF THE CITY. TAKE MEASURES IN PROACTIVE STEPS TO GET ITS HOUSE IN ORDER. AND THE FIRST THING THAT IS DOES THE CITY'S LIQUIDATING ITS ON SURPLUS PROPERTY WE ALREADY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. UNDER CONTRACT. AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE. IN TOTAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF. CITY PROPERTY SURPLUS AND SOLD WHICH WOULD PAY OFF ANY DEBT THAT IS VOTE UP WITH LAKE PLUS ONE. TOO THAT THE SEWER FUND WHICH IS TO ENTER FUND LOAN THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. IN ADDITION TO THAT I WE PRINT WE PROJECTED OR IN THE PROCESS OF ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS. TO UP FOR ANOTHER ONE AND A HALF TO TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS A WITH OTHER BUSINESSES THAT WE'VE ENTERED INTO SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS BY WITHIN THE AREA. AND WE THINK THAT'S VERY DEPENDABLE AND INCOME PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM. WELL. SOME THE THIRD MEASURES WE'VE TAKEN IS WELL WE DONE RECLASSED WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A REORGANIZATION AND REACT THREE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CITY. AND ELIMINATING THOSE PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO MAKE SOME RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT UP WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP FOR THE CITY BUT. CITIES BUT FINANCIAL SITUATION WE'RE LOOKING AT AND IMPLEMENT WHAT I CALL KIND OF AN AUSTERITY MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS IT CITIES HOUSES OF FINANCIAL ORDER. AND WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE DO BUDGETING AND PLANNING SO WE'RE DOING IT NOW REVERSED THE FACT WE'VE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH PARS WE'RE SETTING ASIDE OUR OPEC OBLIGATIONS ARE CALPERS OBLIGATIONS. AS WELL SETTING UP THE BUDGET GENERAL FUND RESERVE IN ADVANCE OF ALL THOSE ARE THE THINGS OF THE CITY'S OPERATING ON ON WHAT ON WHAT IT CAN AFFORD AND NOT WHAT I CAN'T AFFORD WHAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTING IT AS YOU DO RAPPER YEP SKIP WITHOUT A STRICT BUDGET MEASURES WE HIRED RGS TO TO HELP WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THREE MONTHS. TO BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO YOU UP ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE MADE KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT SIX MONTHS. TO SEE THE TRUE FACTS OF IT WE WOULD JUST LIKE SOMETIME BEFORE THIS KIND OF NEXTSTEP COMES BECAUSE OF THE LABEL THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND THAT THE INABILITY OF OUR. WHAT WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE TO THE BOND WORLD? AS WELL AS. WHAT THAT MIGHT DO FOR FUTURE RECRUITMENT OF HIGH CALIBER TELL SO THINK EATER? THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SARAH CANAL. I JUST JUST A COMMENT. WITHOUT WATERS IN MY DISTRICT AND I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSE TO THAT WATER FOR SOMETIME AND AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR FINANCES. THIS AUDIT GROUP INITIALLY CAME UP IN JANUARY. WHERE? YOU KNOW DIDN'T COME UP FOR WHATEVER REASON AND NOW I'M I'M VERY CONFIDENT THIS TEAM THAT'S WORKING ON THIS SIDE YOU KNOW GOV BINDER HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM. I THINK WE'RE ASKING FOR SYSTEM THREE MONTHS AWAY. BUT SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST I MEAN I I'VE BEEN THE FODDER CAN TELL ME WHAT'S THE WORST CASE THERE'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THREE MONTHS BUT. IF THEY HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED TO THE AUDITOR THEY'VE GOT THEIR FINANCES AND CONTROL THAT I WILL SUPPORT THE OUT OF BUT IF WE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S LIKE TEN THOUSAND HOURS TO THE CITY ABOUT WATER. I THINK IT'S BETTER IF THEY USE THAT TIME IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS TO GET THEIR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER IF IT DOESN'T IF IT'S DOESN'T OUTERS. REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL DO NOT AND SO I WOULD JUST ASK FOR A THREE MONTH. THANK YOU. STATE AUGER WHICH LIKE TO RESPOND COM CERTAINLY AYE AYE THEM IT'S DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY HAVE RUN A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THEY HAD BUT THE CITY OF WHAT THAT WATER HAD A RESERVE AMOUNT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS THEY'VE RUN A DEFICIT IN THEIR GENERAL FUND WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO IS CUT BACK ON VARIOUS SERVICES SO IF THAT CONTINUES. WHERE ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO LOOK TO CUT SO THE CONCERN WE WOULD HAVE AND AND WE CERTAINLY WILL DEFERRED OF THEIR? THAT THE COMMITTEE. S WE FELT THAT THIS WAS A VERY HIGH RISK CITY BECAUSE OF NOT JUST THE GENERAL FUND DEFICIT BUT THE INNER LOW ENTER. ENTER FIND LOANS. SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE COMPTROLLER'S JUST LAST WEEK WE STAFFER JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET INTO THE CITY OF ATWATER NOW BUT CERTAINLY WILL DEFER TO THE DESIRE OF THE COMMITTEE IF THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO DELAY. AND WAIT UNTIL THE AUGUST HEARING. WE WILL RESPECT THAT. WE JUST FELT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET AND I GET THIS WORK DONE IMMEDIATELY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO WORK NOW SARAH CANNELLA IT JUST JUSTICE BUT I DON'T WANT TO DEBATE OUR HONOR BECAUSE I WOULD LOSE. BUT HAS A AS A LOCAL A MAYOR YOU KNOW WE WE WENT THROUGH WE HAD A VERY IS A SUBSTANTIAL. GENERAL FUND BALANCE AS WELL AND THE RECESSION TOOK ALMOST ALL OF THAT SO ALL THE CITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO GET ON TOP OF THIS. GET OUT WATER DO WE WILL SEE I'M JUST ASKING FOR A THREE MONTH DELAY I I CAN'T IMAGINE THINGS FALLING APART WITHIN THREE. SURE. SOME LIVER RUBIO. SENATOR ALAN CENTER LARA. IN. I THINK IN. AND. I I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO PUT PREDICT WHAT THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT I THINK WE DID A FROM MONTEBELLO AND WE'D WE GIVE THEM THE COURTESY OF. OF OUR ALLOWING THEM TO TRY AND GET THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER. AND. IF THE COMMITTEE SO WHICH IS I THINK IT WOULD BE A APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY NOW. IF WE DO THIS. I DON'T WANT TO EAT MY WORDS LATER AND SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENS SO IF YOU CAN ASSURE ME THAT THIS IS BEING DONE THEN I WILL SUPPORT THE EXTENSION OR THE. THE PAS IF YOU WELL UNTIL AUGUST BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT. ON THE RESIDENTS OF ATWATER AT RISK BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IN SEOUL YOU KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR US BUT I KNOW WE DID IT FOR THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO ALSO THAT BECAUSE THERE CITY MANAGER WHO HAD BEEN ON THE JOB ONLY FOR ONE DAY. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I ASSURANCES I CAN GET BUT PLEASE DON'T MAKE US EAT OUR WORDS LATER. YOU HAVE OUR OUR OUR EXECUTIVE TEAMS PROFESSIONAL COMMITMENTS. ALRIGHT BUT YOU JUST BEFORE WE GO TO CENTER ALLEN DESCENDANTS ARE LARA ME WE COULD CONSIDER. A MOTION THAT IT DID TO TO APPROVE THEIR AUDIT. UPON SOME CONDITION. AND THE AND THE AND I'M OPEN TO IDEAS SENATOR ALAN. WELL. IT MIGHT MY TENDENCIES TO WANT TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO I THINK DOWN. NO. CERTAINLY WANTS TO SEE. THINGS MADE RIGHT IN THE CITY ITEM I GUESS IF IF WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT A DELAY I THINK WE WOULD ALL ASK YOU PERSONALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THERE'S GOOD PROGRESS BEING MADE IN. BUT I I WOULD. MATT. YEAH CON THOUGH THEN AND THEN A FIRE IF AYE WELL AS IF YOU WILL I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE AUDIT BUT FOR IT TO BEGIN IN AUGUST HOUSE THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S OUR GOAL IN AUGUST THAT THERE'S NOT ONE REQUIRED SO FEW PROVE THE AUDIT STARTING IN AUGUST AND THEY'VE MADE SUBSTANTIAL. IMPROVEMENT THEN THEN AUDIT GOES FORWARD I I THINK OUR GOAL IS FOR THEM TO TO GET THEIR HOUSE OVER SO THAT IT OUGHT IS NOT NECESSARY AGAIN IF IT IS. THEN THEY START AUGUST WE HAVE A MEETING IN AUGUST WE CAN APPROVE AND I WILL I WILL SUPPORT OUT AT THAT TIME DIFFERENT SENATOR LARA THEN BY SARAH. I THINK YOU I'M INTRIGUED ABOUT. CHAIRMAN YOUR YOUR MOTION OF. OUR OR. OF DISCUSSION ABOUT APPROVING NODDED WITH CONDITIONS IF THEY HAVE AN MATT. CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT THAT WOULD BE. BUT CERTAIN ALLOWS US SOMETHING. THAT'S CONSIDERED THAT WE WE DON'T. YOU KNOW IT BELIEVE. IT GIVES YOU THE INSURANCE THAT YOU KNOW NOT THAT. TO YOU KNOW. CUP POLICE ANY BLAME GIVEN THAT DOESN'T AN EXECUTIVE TEAM LOOKING AT I MEAN THAT THEY PROTEST TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS RIGHT SO THAT. ON IT WILL KICK IN. I I MEAN I I THINK THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING WORTHY OF LOOKING OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOW THE THE. THAT MAY NOT A THREAT BUT YOU KNOW THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE. YOU KNOW I'M NOT IT LOOMING IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT I MEAN I THINK. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE HIGH RISK ON IT. PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO BE EVER CATCHES AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS A FAULT. THAT TO KERN FOLKS BUT AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF THAT WATER WHICH IS ALSO EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT SO ARE IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY I GUESS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER RIGHT SO IF WE APPROVE THAT THE OTHER STARTS IN AUGUST IN LEICESTER SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. AND THE AUDITOR AT THAT TIME SAYS WE DON'T NEED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS ARE REAT THAT WE COULD JUST I'M ASSUMING CANCEL AT THE AUGUST MEETING. SO I THINK IT'S SIX OF WHAT HAPPENED AS THE OTHER AYE AYE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT RIGHT IF I COULD WE WOULD WOULD JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CRITERIA WOULD BE BECAUSE I'M WHAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN HAVE A A BUDGET GOING FORWARD. AND WE CAN SHOW WHEN DEMONSTRATE HOW WE WOULD SET ASIDE RESERVE FUND IS WEALTH COMMITMENTS TO. OPEC REQUIREMENTS CALPERS REQUIREMENTS THE IDEA THAT ALL OF US AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TWO THREE MILLION DOLLARS. RESERVE IT'S PROBABLY NOT REALISTIC APPOINTS WHAT I CAN DO IS READ IT REVERSED SHOW THAT WERE REVERSING THE TREND. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THAT MAY NOT BE AT THE AUDITOR'S DISCRETION BUT IT BE AT THIS COMMITTEES DISCRETION WELL BECAUSE WHILE THE OTHER PERSON WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD MAKE DIRECTLY I. THE AUDITOR. IT WOULD BE INCLUDED. AGAIN WE KNOW WE'RE NOT A I'M SORRY I'M SPEAKING OUT OF OUT OF MY BED TO THE CHAIR. OF COURSE WE'RE NOT EXPECTING I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO ALICE HAVING COME UP WITH AS MONEY BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD REALLY NEED ABOUT IT. A LOT THAT. AYE SHOWING THAT WHERE YOU WERE REVERSING THE TREND ISN'T AS IMPORTANT. BEFORE WE CALL ON THE VICE CHAIR AYE IT. CLARIFICATION TO THE AUDITOR CAN. I I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE ON YOUR OWN A JUDGMENT THE INITIAL ASSESSMENTS. BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLYING FOR. AND AUDIT APPROVED BY BUDGET IN JAIL LIKE IS THAT CORRECT WELL I I THINK MISTER CHAIR IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO APPROVE AN AUDIT WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT I WOULD REPORT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. AT OUR AUGUST HEARING THEM ASSUMING WE WILL HAVE IN AUGUST HEARING TO CONSIDER I REQUEST WE COULD CERTAINLY REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND SAY WE'VE LOOKED AT MATERIALS THAT THE CITY OF ATWATER. HAS PROVIDED TO US RECENTLY WE'VE ALSO ENGAGED WITH IF THE CITY'S WILLING TO DO THAT ENGAGE WITH THEM OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH TENNIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT WHEN WE CONDUCT OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENTS. WE ARE ENGAGING WITH LOCALS. IT AND NOW IT'S VOLUNTARY IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION HIS WAY ON ABSTRACT STORY AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT BORE CERTAINLY LOOKING TO SEE. YOU MAY BE IN A DEFICIT SITUATION RIGHT NOW BUT DO YOU HAVE PLANS AND DO THOSE PLANS LOOK REASONABLE AND THAT'S THE CRITERIA THAT WE WOULD BE USING. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN WORKING WITH THE CITY OF ATWATER. ARM IN PREPARATION TO COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND SAY YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE COULD RESEND THE AUDIT IN AUGUST SAYING THAT BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE IN. THE ABILITY ENGAGE WITH THE CITY THAT. THE RISKS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED MAY STILL BE THERE BUT THE PLANS AND PROTOCOLS THAT THE CITY HAS PUT IN PLACE WE THINK ARE REASONABLE SO WHAT WE WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD DO. IN THAT SITUATION IF WE DON'T CONDUCT AN AUDIT WE WOULD STAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CITY OF THAT WATER AND IF WE FELT THERE WERE CONCERNS WE MIGHT COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR. AND AND REQUEST AN AUDIT AGAIN SO I THINK WE CERTAINLY COULD DO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF MY GENERAL COUNSEL. YOU AGREE WITH ME. MIGHT NOT SO MY I'M DEFERRING TO MY CHIEF COUNSEL HAS UNDERSTANDS OUR REGULATORY. AUTHORITY S. THINK IF THE COMMITTEE MAKES A DECISION TO BASICALLY CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE AUDIT. AND EXPECT THAT MY OFFICE REPORT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE IN AUGUST I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. BY SARAH. WELL. LET ME. IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING IN AUGUST IN MY POSITION ON THIS WOULD CHANGE. BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ART IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HOURS WHICH IS WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS SO I WON'T BE DONE TOMORROW ANYWAY. IT PROBABLY CAN'T START TOMORROW SO THERE'S SOME SPOOL UP TIME FOR THIS THING. BUT APPROVAL OF AN AUDITS HAS CONSEQUENCES SO IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO GIVE. THE CITY THAT'S ATTEMPTING TO RIGHT THE SHIP IN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO BEFORE WE LAUNCH AN AUDIT TEAM IN THERE THEN. CONDITIONALLY APPROVING AN AUDIT HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT. MAY NOT BE REVERSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GET THIS ON THIS DIRE AS CAN SET SPECIFIC ENOUGH CONDITIONS ON A LOT OF APPROVAL TO MAKE ANY SENSE OF IT. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE WITH THIS ITEM AGENDA IT ANYWAY IN AUGUST WOULD BE MY GUESS EITHER BECAUSE. THE AUDITOR DECIDES IT OR NOT IT'S NOT REQUIRED WITH THE CITY DISPUTES THE AUDITOR'S POSITION ON WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SUGGESTIVE IS IF THE INTENT. AND THE SPIRIT IN THE INTEREST OF THOSE OF US ON THE DYESS IS TO GIVE THIS THIS YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE WATER OUT OF THE BOAT BEFORE WE CAN MEN. AS A STATE THEN LET'S GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE WATER OUT OF THE BOAT. GEN DID IN AUGUST IS NECESSARY AND THAT THE AUDITOR STOPPED START THE ON IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT. THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA BE TRYING TO. DESIGN CONDITIONS ON AUDIT APPROVAL HERE THAT ARE GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DESIGN. ANYWAY. THAT'S MY COMMENT MISTER CHAIR ALRIGHT THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR SO. I'M I'M REVIEWING THE THE RULES OF A. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND. AS PART OF THE RULES RULE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE FOR COMMITTEE ACTIONS HAS APPROVED THE REQUEST DENIED THE REQUEST OR. THE THIRD OPTION RETAIN THE REQUEST FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION SENECA WELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT. YEAH MOVES FOR A FUTURE CONSIDERATION. OKAY. IS OUR SECOND MS CHAIR BEFORE WE TAKE OF I'M SORRY TO SOMEONE UP TO CLARIFY BEFORE I VOTE. WOULD IT IF THIS BAR MOTION PASSES WOULD PRECLUDE. THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE FROM WORKING WITH THE CITY OF ATWATER. CLIMATE LET ME ASK THE HORRIFIC. IF THE OUR. IS THAT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO. TO HAVE FIXED THE THE PROBLEMS IF. AS WELL AS HERE ARE HOW LIMITED YOU ARE YOU A BULL AGAIN I'LL I'LL DEFER TO MY GENERAL COUNSEL BUT I WOULD I WOULD HOPE AND ASSUME UNDER OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AND OUR REGULATORY AUTHORITY WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL ENTITIES SO BEFORE WE WOULD COME BACK AND TAKE UP THIS COMMITTEE'S TIME. I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CONSIDERING AND AS I INDICATED THE CITY AND JUST RECENTLY LAST WEEK SENT US I THINK IT'S THIS BINDER MATERIALS MY STAFF HAVE JUST STARTED LOOKING AT IT. SO I WOULD I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO COULD CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE CITY SO THAT WHEN WE COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. WERE COMING BACK WITH AN INFORMED. A. PROPOSAL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE CITY OF ATWATER I'LL SECOND THAT CAN NARRATE WITH THAT CLARIFICATION A SECOND FROM HIS RUBIO.
