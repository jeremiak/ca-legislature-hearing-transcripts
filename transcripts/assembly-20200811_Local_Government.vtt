BY THE VICE CHAIRMAN THE

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:22.463
COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO DO-

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.231
LEGISLATION AROUND HOUSING

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.533
WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:28.169
AFFORDABILITY AND SUBSIDIES

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.371
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.274
REGULATION AND SEEK WORK ALL OF

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:34.842
THOSE THINGS ARE ISSUES ISSUES

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.677
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS YOUR

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.779
BODY AND THE ASSEMBLY IN THE

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.047
SENATE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.649

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:50.358
ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.493
THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.628
OF THOSE ISSUES. IF MONEY AND

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:56.731
SUBSIDIES WERE THE THING THAT

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:57.999

MORE HOUSING UNITS FOR OUR

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.969

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:05.239
ACTUALLY EASIER IT WASN'T

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:05.840

AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ANY

02:12:56.702 --> 02:12:58.637
HOUSING AT ALL HAS REALLY

02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:00.405
CREATED THE SITUATION WHERE YOU

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:02.541
SEE COBIT IS RAGING. IN THE

02:13:02.607 --> 02:13:03.809
FARMWORKERS COMMUNITY BECAUSE

02:13:03.875 --> 02:13:04.710
PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN REALLY

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:05.877
SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.979
SITUATIONS SO AFFORDABLE

02:13:08.046 --> 02:13:10.982
HOUSING IS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:11.583
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES. IT WILL

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:13.285
AND WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:14.953
ARE WHAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER IS

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.788
BECAUSE WE HAVE A NEW DENSITY

02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:19.925
BONUS. LAW THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:22.227

SET SOME AFFORDABLE CRITERIA

02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:28.567
THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE TO

02:13:28.633 --> 02:13:29.935
FOLLOW AND SO THAT'S THE REASON

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:31.370
THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A-

02:13:31.436 --> 02:13:34.406
MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT-

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:36.808

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:42.314
ISSUE OUT BEYOND THAT. IS

02:13:42.381 --> 02:13:43.782
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE'S A

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.317
DESPERATE NEED IN MY

02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:46.518
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DOUBLE

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:48.553
DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT DURING THE

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.288
GOOD TIMES OF THE YEAR. TO HAVE

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:52.991
THE ABILITY TO CALL EIGHT. ON

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:55.694
UP. A JOB GOOD PAYING. AND

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:58.130
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS

02:13:58.196 --> 02:13:58.730
IS ALL ABOUT IS TRYING TO MEET

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:01.566
OUR OF OUR HOUSING. ISSUEAT

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.735
AND OUR JOBS JOBS ISSUE AND DO

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.971
IT IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.539
CREATE VACANCIES IN OUR

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:08.640
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE TO BE

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:11.042
BOARDED UP. THAT ATTRACT

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:12.878
BLIGHT. AND THE KIND OF

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:14.746
VANDALISM THAT HAS FIVE

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:17.482
FIREFIGHTERS WORRIED BECAUSE

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:18.083
THEN YOU END UP WITH THE FIRE

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:19.785
SO MY POINT ABOUT ALL OF THAT.

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:22.387
THAT IS THAT. WE'VE FULLY

02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:24.189

THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.245
ENVIRONMENTAL PROP PRINCIPLES.

NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:16:17.702 --> 02:16:19.671
SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACES THE NEED

02:16:19.738 --> 02:16:21.439
FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND

02:16:21.506 --> 02:16:22.541
THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:16:22.607 --> 02:16:24.075

WITH THESE RARE ABUSES OF SHORT

A TOOL TO THEM. NOT A

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:39.864

YOU LOOK AT THE LAW TODAY IS

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:52.911
THAT. A VIOLATION BECOMES JUST

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:54.712

BUSINESS A COUPLE HUNDRED

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:58.783

IMPRESSION- DIED. CITIES OVER

02:45:38.361 --> 02:45:41.998
ONE WHICH HAS NEVER WON HIS OWN

02:45:42.065 --> 02:45:42.532
FOR MORE DENSITY FOR MORE

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:43.166
HOUSING. BUT THAT IS NOT

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:44.200
ACCURATE THEIR PLENTY OF THEIR

02:45:44.267 --> 02:45:45.502
CITIES THAT DON'T. BUT THERE

FOR MORE HOUSING IN PARTS OF

02:45:49.706 --> 02:45:52.742
THEIR CITY. BUT CALIFORNIA LAW.

02:45:52.809 --> 02:45:54.844
STATE LAW MAKES IT REALLY

02:45:54.911 --> 02:45:56.946
REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO DO IT.

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:58.615
IT MAKES IT TAKE YEARS AND

02:45:58.682 --> 02:46:00.050
YEARS AGO TAKE FIVE TO TEN

02:46:00.116 --> 02:46:01.985
YEARS. TO DO EVEN A MODEST

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:04.621
REZONING. IT CAN COST AN

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:05.855
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER

02:46:05.922 --> 02:46:07.791
MONEY. TO GO THROUGH THAT YEAH

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:10.527
I OUR PROCESS. AND IT CAN LEAD

02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:12.095
TO UNENDING LITIGATION AND SO

02:46:12.162 --> 02:46:13.496
THEY ARE CITIES THAT WANT TO

02:46:13.563 --> 02:46:15.231
ZONE FOR MORE DENSITY. IN PARTS

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:17.500
OF OUR CITY. BUT THEY JUST

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:18.501
DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT

02:46:18.568 --> 02:46:19.402
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE SO

02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:21.438
LENGTHY EXPENSIVE AND IS GOING

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:23.807
TO BE A LITIGATION. WHAT SB

02:46:23.873 --> 02:46:25.842
NINE OH TWO DOES. IS IT ALLOWS

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:28.078

FOR UP TO TEN UNIT BUILDINGS

02:46:30.013 --> 02:46:32.615
ARE COULD BE THREE UNITS ARE

02:46:32.682 --> 02:46:34.117
FIVE UNITS RESPONDING UNITS OR

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:34.718
TEN UNITS ARE A MIX WHATEVER

02:46:34.784 --> 02:46:38.755
THEY WIND. UP TO TEN UNITS- IN

02:46:38.822 --> 02:46:40.924
A STREAMLINED EXPEDITED WAY BY

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:44.627
ACTION OF THEIR CITY COUNCIL.

02:46:44.694 --> 02:46:47.364
THIS ARE EXCLUDES SPRAWL THAT'S

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:50.767
NOT WHAT WE WANT- SO THE- THIS

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:52.635
TOOL IS LIMITED TO AREAS THAT

02:46:52.702 --> 02:46:55.004
ARE NEAR. TRANSIT ORIENTED JOB

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:58.341
RICH AREA OR AN INFILL AREAS SO

02:46:58.408 --> 02:46:59.743
WE DON'T WANT TO BE GIVING

02:46:59.809 --> 02:47:02.946
CITIES. MORE TOOLS TO HAVE MORE

02:47:03.012 --> 02:47:05.148
SPRAWL WE WANTED TO BE A

02:47:05.215 --> 02:47:07.751
SUSTAINABLE AND SERVICE. TO

02:47:07.817 --> 02:47:09.586
UTILIZE THIS TOOL. THE

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:12.422
PROMPTLY- INCREASE ERROR ZONE

HOUSING ABOUT CITY. WE HAVE AN

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:16.226

THIS COMMITTEE- BEFORE THE

02:47:18.094 --> 02:47:19.329
CHAIR AND- I THINK THERE ARE

02:47:19.396 --> 02:47:20.864
SOME. DIFFERENCES IN THE

02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:22.599

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:30.240
HOUSING GOALS NOT IS PLAYING

02:47:30.306 --> 02:47:32.008
OUT NOW. IN THAT IT'S VERY VERY

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:34.277
IMPORTANT BECAUSE RENO WAS NOT

02:47:34.344 --> 02:47:35.879
MEETING OUR ACTUAL HOUSING

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:39.749

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:46.456
WE'RE TELLING SAID WE WANT YOU

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:47.524

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:48.892
WERE MADE HARD FOR THEM TO ZONE

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:51.461
