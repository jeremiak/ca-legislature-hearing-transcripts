ENSURING THAT OUTSTANDING

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.428
RESTITUTION AND RESTITUTION

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.364
FINES ARE NOT A BARRIER TO

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.832
EXPUNGE. ARE CURRENTLY PEOPLE

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.335

DENIED EXPUNGEMENT EVEN IF

THEY'RE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.740
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.076
PAY OUTSTANDING RESTITUTION AND

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.378
RESTITUTION FINES RESTITUTION

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:49.148
THAT IS OFTEN THE ONLY THING

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.582
HOLDING SOMEONE BACK FROM

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.251
CLEARING THE RECORD AND FINING.

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.553
AND HOUSING- ADDITIONALLY WHEN

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.121
SETTING RESTITUTION AMOUNTS

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:57.556
QUARTER NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.658
INTO ACCOUNT A PERSON'S ABILITY

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.427
TO PAY THAT RESTITUTION THIS

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.028
MEANS THAT VICTIMS OF CRIME WHO

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.563
WERE AWARDED RESTITUTION

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.398
OVERWHELMINGLY RECEIVED EITHER

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.734
NOTHING OR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.703
THE RESTITUTION. BECAUSE OF THE

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.237
TENANTS SIMPLY LACKS THE

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:15.441
RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PAYER.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.242
CARLAW COURTS TO THAN A REQUEST

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.545
FOR EXPUNGEMENT EVEN IF THE

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.113
INDIVIDUAL IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.449
IF THEY HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:25.684
UNPAID RESTITUTION. ON A CORK

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.119
AND THEN I EXPANSION ON THIS

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:29.988
BASIS EVEN IF THE DEFENDANT IS

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:30.789
LIVING IN POVERTY. THIS KIND OF

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:32.424
BARRIER TO REENTRY DOES NOT

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.525
INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.594
SOMEONE WILL PAY THE RESTITUTION

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.363
IN FACT BLOCKING SOMEONE FROM

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:38.697
CLEARING THEIR RECORDS MAKES IT

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.499
EVEN LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.835
EVER BE IN A POSITION TO PAY THE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:46.238
RESTITUTION. I WANT TO BE VERY

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.107
VERY CLEAR. S. B. ELEVEN OH SIX

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.776
DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REDUCE OR

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.811
ELIMINATE A PERSON'S RESTITUTION

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.213
THE AMOUNT THAT A PERSON WAS A

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:56.281
RESTITUTION THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.751
TOUCH. THE RESTITUTION OWED- NOR

00:16:58.817 --> 00:16:59.818
DOES IT IMPACT THE COURT'S

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.587
ABILITY TO ENFORCE RESTITUTION

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:05.257
ORDERS IT SIMPLY. PROVIDES THAT

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.159
UNPAID RESTITUTION WILL NOT BE A

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:10.195
BARRIER. TO EXPLAINS RUN-

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:12.297
SERVICE SOMEONE CAN RE ENTER.

MOST OF HISTORY AT LEAST MY

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:52.871
HISTORY. THESE INDIVIDUALS NEVER

SENTENCES FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.569
EVEN FOR THE WORST OFFENDERS. WE

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.838
DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON VERY

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:28.607
MUCH ANYMORE. AND NOW WE'RE

HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT PAY ANYWAY

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.451

DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.908
MAKING IS RATHER CIRCUITOUS IT'S

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:53.578
CIRCULAR. VICTIMS NEED THE MONEY

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.714
KORUGAR RESTITUTION YOU SHOULD

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.349
BE PAYING RESTITUTION BUT WE'RE

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:58.684
NOT GOING TO CHANGE WE'RE NOT

RESTITUTION. AND HOW IN THE

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.725
WORLD IS AT WORK. AND WE CAN SAY

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.060
JUDGES AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:09.995
OUR JUDGES HAVE THE DISCRETION

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.064
TO DO THAT BUT LISTEN TO THE

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.865
PRESSURE THAT WE PUT ON

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:14.633
OURSELVES HERE ONE SIDEOR THE

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.868
OTHER. THE PRESSURE IS PUT ON A

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:19.137
JUDGE IN A COURT. AND WE EXPECT

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.305
THE JUDGE TO WITHSTAND THE

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.940
PRESSURE AND DO THE RIGHT THING

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.975
SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT SOMETIMES

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:26.011
THEY DON'T BECAUSE JUDGES STAND

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:27.679
FOR REELECTION AS WELL. AND THEY

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.514
CANNOT ENGAGE IN THE TYPE OF

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.249
PARTISAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:33.485
BUT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DEFEND

SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:41.493
BECAUSE I THINK. WHEN A PERSON

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.628
HAS SATISFIED THE SENTENCE OF

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.597
THE COURT HAS IMPOSED FOR THE

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:47.299
CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED. THE

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.501
AND I'M I THINK VICTIMS DESERVE

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:50.936
RESTITUTION I THINK WE NEED TO

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.370
MAKE SURE. THAT THE MONEY GETS

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:54.206
TO THE VICTIMS. BUT INDIVIDUALS

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.674
DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.343
JOB TO EARN THE MONEY. TO PAY

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.080

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:14.659
SAID IT IN THE BEGINNING BUT

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.328
APPARENTLY I NEED TO SAY IT

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:19.064
AGAIN. THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:22.000
WAY REDUCE THE RESTITUTION IS

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.436
OWED BY ONE PENNY THE BILL HAS

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.371
NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW MUCH YOU

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.406
ARE IF THIS IS SIGNED INTO LAW

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:31.309
ANYONE WHO OWES RESTITUTION WILL

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:34.346
CONTINUE TO- THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.914
RESTITUTION WHICH CAN'T BE

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.550
DISCHARGED IN BANKRUPTCY. BY THE

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.285
WAY. SO TO SUGGEST THAT THIS

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:45.557
SOMEHOW IMPACTS PEOPLE. PEOPLE'S

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:46.658
OBLIGATION TO PAY RESTITUTION IS

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:50.929
SIMPLY FALSE WHAT THIS BILL DOES

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.733
DO IS TO SAY WE WANT TO ACTUALLY

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.234

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.338
BACK TOGETHER. AND IF PEOPLE

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:01.673
CAN'T GET THEIR LIFE BACK

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.375
TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:04.943
GOTTEN EXPUNGEMENT. AND THEY

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.412
CAN'T GET A GOOD JOB MAYBE THEY

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.714

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.686

PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR. THEY WERE

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.262

YOU'RE POOR AND YOU CAN'T PAY

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:37.509
