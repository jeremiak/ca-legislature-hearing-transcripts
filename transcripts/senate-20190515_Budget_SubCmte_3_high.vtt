THERE'S A QUESTION WE HAVE A A

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:17.483
GROWING NEED FOR HSS -- I'M A

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.117
PART OF THE SILVER SONORA RIGHT

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.686

SUNSET -- SENDS A A LOT OF FEAR

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.498

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.087
SHOCKWAVE.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.089

SURPLUS THIS YEAR?

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.205
WE SHOULD EVALUATE THE PROGRAM

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:13.606
EVERY YEAR BASED ON IS MERITS

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.475
BASED ON REVENUE COMING IN BASED

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.843

NO AND I UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.331

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.954
AMBITIOUS PLAN.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.489

IT IS -- HIS PHILANTHROPY.

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.803
ARE WE NOT DOING IT ON THE BACKS

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.140
OF PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:57.877
MOST HILL -- CONSTITUENTS.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.645
THE BUDGET IS NOTHING MORE THAN

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.047
A PRIORITY.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.882

SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:25.605
THIS IS NICELY BUT AYE AYSHA

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.839
SAYS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.341
GROWING PROGRAMS AND SAID THIS

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:29.976
IS A WAY FOR US TO LOOK AT COSTS

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.143
AND TO MAKE SURE.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.279
WE ARE HAVING A STRUCTURALLY

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.314
SOUND BUDGET AND I UNDERSTAND

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.049
THAT BUT IF YOU'RE BALANCING

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:38.818
WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FUTURE

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.319
BUDGETS ON THE BACKS OF THOSE

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.154
THAT CANNOT CHAMPION THESE

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.589
ISSUES FOR THEMSELVES.

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.690

SUNSETS ON MANY PROGRAMS.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.163
THAT I CAN TELL YOU IN A

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.732
BIPARTISAN WAY PEOPLE ARE VERY

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.166
ANGRY ABOUT IT.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:58.337
AND WE NEED TO LOOK FOR THE

00:08:58.404 --> 00:08:59.538
GOVERNOR KNOW THAT.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:00.306
IT'S ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THOSE

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.073
A CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.074
AND WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THESE

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:03.276
ARBITRARY -- SUNSETS AND

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.411
PROGRAMS AT IN FIGHTING FOR

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:06.045
RESTORATION FOR MANY MANY YEARS

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.280
TO COME.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.514
I'M NOT TRYING TO KILL THE

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.149
MESSENGER ARTIST -- PROCEDURE

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.083
SENDING MY MESSAGE TO THE

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.519
GOVERNOR THAT I THINK IT'S

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.788
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.124
IS THERE STONE -- I TO SHARE

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.226
CENTER SENS CONCERN IN LA IS

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.394
CONCERNED -- IS REALLY

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.095
APPRECIATE I RECOGNIZE THAT

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.931
WHILE THE BUDGET ITSELF IS A ONE

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:28.935
YOUR DOCUMENT -- BUT I CERTAINLY

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.971
AGREE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK OUT

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.673
AT OUT YEARS.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.241
BUT I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT --

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.710
ON THE 7% CUT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.445
OF THE GREAT RECESSION.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.846
ALRIGHT SO.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.449
THIS IS THE RESTORATION OF THE

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.452
7% IT'S NOT AND SO REALLY WHAT

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.554
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WERE

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.022
SAYING THAT WILL BE MADE THE CUT.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.091
WHEN I BRING IT BACK BUT THEN

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.259
WE'RE GONNA CUT YOU AGAIN?

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.160
ABOUT THE FUTURE TWO YEARS FROM

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:55.995
NOW WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:58.164
OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.132
THE GOVERNOR WILL WHEN THAT TIME

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:00.866
COMES.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.134
I STILL HAVE A CONVERSATION

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.004
ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT SURE YEAH I

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.206
I DON'T AGREE WITH BUILDING IT

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.174
IN.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.942
INTO THE MECHANISM CLEARLY YOU

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.977
KNOW IN OUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.478
THE BUDGET OF COURSE KNOWING TO

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:13.846
LOOK AT THIS YOU WANNA SEE OUT

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:19.485
YOUR IMPACTS -- BUT I THINK AS

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.419
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ONLY THE

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.220
AGING POPULATION WE HAVE A

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.955
GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WHO

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.324
ARE LIVING -- WITH.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.526
DISABILITIES WHO NEED TO SUPPORT

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.296
SO THEY CAN LEAD -- PRODUCTIVE

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:34.800
AND LIVES WERE THERE -- THAT.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.003
THE IDEA THAT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:38.237
THAT.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.306
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.674
WORKING IN THE FIELD AND ALSO

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.342
PEOPLE MIGHT CONSIDER WORKING IN

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.278
THE FIELD RIGHT.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:49.815
NO THAT WE BUILT IN A 7% CUT.

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:50.983
AND HAVING THE ISLANDS THAT

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.185
UNCERTAINTY WHAT WILL REALLY

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.420
HAPPEN I MEAN I THINK THEY HAVE

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.488
BUT IT ALWAYS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.122
GOING TO ASSUME OF THE BILL THE

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:56.989
SEND THAT THAT'S WHAT WILL

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:57.690
HAPPEN.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.291
RIGHT I MEAN WE MAY NOT ACTUALLY

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.459
DO IT WHEN THE TIME COMES THE

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:01.527
PENDING WHAT'S ECONOMIC

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.362
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:04.130
END OF THE ECONOMIC SERVES AS A

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.731
POOR ME MAY EVEN DECIDE

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.633
HOPEFULLY NOT -- YOU'LL HAVE TO

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.868
DECIDE WHAT WHAT WE PRIORITIES

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.403
WHAT ELSE WE YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.438
WE COTTON THE OTHER BIGGER CUTS

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.205
THAT WE LOOK AT IN DIFFERENT

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.841
PLACES -- BUT I AM YOU KNOW I I

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.009
SHARE WITH LA IS CONCERNED AT

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.244
THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS A

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.879
PROGRAM THAT'S AN ONGOING

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.448
PROGRAM IT'S IT'S NOT A ONE TIME

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.350
SO THAT KIND OF TREATING THIS IS

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.351
A ONE TIME.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.719
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY SENDS THE

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:29.688
WRONG SIGNAL AND AND ACTUALLY

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:30.956
UNDERMINES OUR EFFORTS TO

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.491
PROVIDE SERVICES BECAUSE WE'RE

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:33.859
TELLING THE PEOPLE WHO.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.394
MAY BE GOING INTO THIS PEOPLE

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.562
ARE TRYING TO PLAN FOR THE

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.164
FUTURE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.398
NEED FOR THE PROGRAM DOESN'T

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.500
CHANGE AND YES IT IS ONE THE

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:42.301
FASTEST GROWING PROGRAMS.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:47.473
I WOULD POINT OUT THOUGH THE

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.474
ALTERNATIVES.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.008
THE ALTERNATIVE THAT THIS

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.042
PROGRAM IS NOT THAT THE PEOPLE

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:50.943
DISAPPEAR.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.811
NOTHING DID NEED DISAPPEARS IT

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:52.745
GETS PUSHED AND OTHER PLACES IN

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.146
FACT.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.181
I BELIEVE LA YOU LOOKED AT THIS

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:57.316
RATE I MEAN THE ALTERNATIVE IS

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.485
WE INSTITUTIONALIZE PEOPLE.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.353
AND THEN WHO PAYS FOR MOST OF

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.622
THAT WELL ACTUALLY INTERESTING

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:05.191
NO THOUGHT TO US AGAIN RATE

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.859
NURSING HOME CARE AT THE DELTA

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:10.029
KERR DAT UNDR MEDICARE AL.

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:10.596
AND SO ACTUALLY [inaudible]

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:12.231
IT.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.899
THE WHO'S US ACTUALLY TO FIGURE

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:16.202
HOW WE SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM SO

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.837
WE CAN NOT OF SO ACTUALLY IS A

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.305
BUDGET EVEN DUMBER BUDGET

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.272
COMMITTEE CELL I MEAN THERE'S A

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.574
POLICY ISSUE EVEN FROM A

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.576
BUDGETARY STANDPOINT.

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:26.245
I REALLY DO WONDER -- INURED

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:27.980
LONG TERM ANALYSIS DID YOU

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:29.982
FACTOR IN THE FACT THATOKAY WE

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:32.118
DO A 7% CUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.719
THEN TO THE SERVICES.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.554
AND THEN HOW MUCH OF A SHIFT WE

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.456
NOW HAVE FROM HSS TO OTHER

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.091
PROGRAMS AT THE STATE ALSO TO

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.459
PAY FOR AND HOW COST EFFECTIVE

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:45.364
THOSE ARE -- SO I I CERTAINLY --

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.266
IN A WOULD APPRECIATE -- BEFORE

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.235
I WOULD CERTAINLY EVEN ENTERTAIN

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.137
LOOKING AT THIS -- AGREEING TO

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.838
SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'D LIKE TO

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.240
SEE AN ANALYSIS.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.708
THAT SHOWS THAT EVEN FROM A

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:56.842
PURELY FINANCIAL PLAIN VIEW

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.043
ALTHOUGH AGAIN THE SHE'S NOT

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.645
JUST FINANCIAL AND WE'LL TALK

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:00.679
ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:01.981
EVEN FINANCIAL VIEW CAN YOU

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:02.648
ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT THIS

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:03.883
ACTUALLY WOULD WORK THIS

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.584
ACTUALLY REDUCES OUR OUTGOING

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.386
SPENDING MY GUESS IS IT MIGHT

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.888
ACTUALLY NOT LET YOU PRETEND

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.389
LIKE THIS.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.192
NEEDS TO STOP.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.126
YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR MAN I THINK

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.494
THAT'S AN UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTION.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:19.532
SO -- HOPEFULLY -- THE A JOB FOR

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:20.332
BY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.434
PARTICULAR AND ALSO THE OVERALL

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:23.903
IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.539
SUNSET ON ON GOING SERVICES I

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:27.139
MEAN WITH A SEVEN OZ

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.440
CONVERSATION WE WANT THE

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.675
SERVICES OR NOT.

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:32.678
YES WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.248
THE OF YOUR COSTS WOULD BE SO.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.116
OKAY.

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.017
IS IT IS IT ANY OF BY WAYS ANY

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.952
IN AND SUCH ANALYSIS BEEN DONE

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.787
AND AND FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.291
AS I SUGGESTED. ONE THE ANALYSIS

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:48.027
WAS THE MAYOR REVISION FORECAST

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.895
WHICH IS NOT PROTECTING A

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:50.963
RECESSION BUT IN MY MIND

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.698
RECESSION COVERS ALL AND REVENUE

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.200
DECLINES OF NATURE BUT IF YOU

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.334
LOOK AT THE SHIFT TO THEN THE

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.236
COST SHIFT THAT COULD HAPPEN AS

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:58.637
A RESULT OF THIS.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.439
THEY'RE LIKE INSIST.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.974
THIS WAS PACIFIC PLAY FOR THAT I

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.842
AND JUST LAST COST AND THOSE OUT

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.010
YEARS OKAY SO SO ONE OF THE

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.812
THINGS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.180
WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE IN SILOS.

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:09.215
WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THE PEOPLE

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.016
HAVE NEEDS.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.218
YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE A POLICY

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:14.153
CHOICE NOT TO MEET THEM.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.487
RECOGNIZE RIGHT LET'S LET'S E

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.056
HONEST WITH PEOPLE THAN OKAY WE

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.123
COULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.426
HE CAN AFFORD IT WE'RE NOT TO

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:20.726
PROVIDE IT.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.695
OR SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT ARE A

00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:24.697
POLICY PROPOSALS AND COME OUT

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:26.198
AND SAY THAT OTHERWISE THEN MY

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.499
AND SAY WELL WE CAN MEET THE

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:30.002
NEEDS BUT WHEN I GO FIGHT THIS

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.370
WAY.

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.204
THEN WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE IT AND

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.072
THE COULD TURN OUT THE

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:34.106
ALTERNATIVE IS MUCH MORE

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.108
EXPENSIVE AND SO I HOPE WE'RE

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:36.709
NOT JUST LOOKING AT THINGS IN

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:37.443
SILOS.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:39.578
AND WE'RE BEING HONEST ABOUT.

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.480
WHAT WE'RE REALLY PROPOSING?

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.948
INCIDENT IN THESE PROPOSALS I

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.617
RECOGNIZE THOSE CONCERNS OKAY

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:46.919
THANK YOU.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.053
YES SAYS THERE'S NOTHING I'M

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.421
GOING TO FALL APART I'M NOT SURE

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.156
YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.324
THE QUESTION IS THAT -- DO WE

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.892
ARBITRARILY.

00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:55.828
CUT BACK ON THE 7% UNDERSTANDING

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:56.829
THAT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.898
SOME PEOPLE. TWO SIX SERVICES

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.200
AND MORE INSTITUTIONALIZED

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.269
SETTINGS SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.236
TWELVE BUCKS AN HOUR.

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.804
ON HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER OR

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.741
FRIEND OR YOU DEDICATED HEALTH

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:09.074
CARE.

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.210
PROVIDER -- PROVIDE THE SERVICES

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.811
WERE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:14.413
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS GOING TO

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.149
BE SPENT -- WHICH IS A MUCH MORE

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:22.087
EXPENSIVE -- AVENUE -- I HSS IS

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.089
A ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM IS A NOT.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.357
IT'S AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.492
WHICH MEANS WERE MANDATED BY LAW

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.260
TO GIVE IT.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.528
CERTAINLY IF WE DON'T FIND IT

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.063
APPROPRIATELY.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.164
WE CAN RATION IT.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.799
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO EARN A

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:35.267
LIVING WAGE I DON'T SUGGEST THAT

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.368
THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO PAY PEOPLE

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.569
EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR SO THEY

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.171
CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.839
PEOPLE TO DESPERATELY NEED THEM.

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.107
BUT I THINK THE QUESTION WAS HAS

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:43.475
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:46.145
DONE A ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS TO

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.281
KNOW THAT IF WE CAN EMBARK ON

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.349
BUT NOT RESTORING THE FEE

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.717
PERMANENTLY.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.085
AND THAT RESULTS IN A LOSS OF

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.787
SERVICE.

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:55.888
TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:57.489
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL WITH

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:59.158
THE ALTERNATIVE COST.

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.894
INSTITUTIONALIZING THOSE BE --

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.495
HAS JUST AS DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.932
DENNIS STUDY IN IF YOU HAVEN'T

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.801
HAS A PHILLY -- DONE THAT STUDY.

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:09.535
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:10.936
BUDGETS ON A MULTI YEAR AND

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:11.570
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.505
AT AND OUR ANALYSIS TO ENSURE

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:15.174
THAT IN THESE OUT YEARS WE ARE

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.376
PRODUCING A STRUCTURALLY SOUND

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.043
BUDGET.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.345
I WOULD DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.013
AT THE LA OKAY **** BUT BUT YOUR

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.448
ANALYSIS IS FLAWED BECAUSE YOU

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:23.816
MENTIONED YOU LOOK AT HOW YOUR

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.485
BUDGETS AS DECLINING.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:27.519
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK AT YOUR OUT

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.254
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.623
MAINTAINED SO YOU HAVE A FLAWED

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.059
ANALYSIS IN MY VIEW DEPARTMENT

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:38.397
OF LA -- CAN YOU RESPOND.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.398
GINNY GIVE ME GINNY FELLOW WITH

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:40.966
THE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS DOCTOR

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.801
PAN INDICATED WE DID LOOK AT

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:45.537
THIS YEARS AGO ACTUALLY AND IF

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:46.972
THE CONTEXT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.207
THE PROGRAM WAS QUITE DIFFERENT

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.675
AT THE TIME.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:50.876
BUT THE READ THE PROPOSED

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:53.345
REDUCTION WAS NEARLY A COMPLETE

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.179
ELIMINATION THE PROGRAM ABOUT IT

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:58.217
WAS LIKE NEARLY 87% REDUCTION.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:16:59.518
SO WE WERE REALLY LOOKING AT THE

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:00.953
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING THE

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:03.822
PROGRAM AND NOT AND DID FIND

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:04.857
THAT.

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:06.558
IT WAS COST EFFECTIVE TO THE

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.926
STATE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:08.594
AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE THE

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.062
COUNTIES ALSO HAVE A SHARE AND

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:10.963
IT'S NOT JUST.

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.030
AS YOU SAID IT'S TWELVE DOLLARS

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.332
AN HOUR BUT THE STATURE OF THAT

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.833
IS ACTUALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.835
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE FEDERAL

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:17.436
GOVERNMENT KICKING IN AND THE

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:17.970
COUNTIES.

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:18.837
SO WE DID LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.272
NOT LOOKED AT SORT OF THIS

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.741
MARGINAL THE 7% DECREASE IN I

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:23.742
THINK OF THAT IT'S A BIT.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.511
OF A TRICK YOUR ANALYSIS TO DO

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:26.712
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN ALL OR

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.414
NOTHING SO ASSUMING SOMEONE HAS

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.682
TO GO INTO INSTITUTIONALIZED

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.951
CARE TODAY -- NUMBER ONE WHAT IS

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:33.952
THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF THE

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.754
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WITH

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:36.955
COLLECTIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.957
CONTRIBUTION WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:39.958
IT I'M NOT HOLDING TO A FIGURE

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.260
IS THE AVERAGE COST PER DAY THAT

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.461
WE WOULD HAVE TO SPELL PER DAY

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.929
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT PER DAY.

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.631
I THINK THAT AND I'M NOT ARE

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:46.965
MEDI CAL PERSON BUT I NOTICED

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.368
THE FEDS PAY ROUGHLY ABOUT 50%

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.037
pAND I THINK A NURSING HOME COST

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.673
AS UPWARDS OF SIXTY TO A HUNDRED

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.008
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TOTAL

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.844
BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENT

00:17:58.911 --> 00:17:59.611
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I AGES

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:01.713
US IS THAT IS A BIGGER BANG FOR

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.415
THE BUCK IT'S LESS MONEY THERE'S

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:04.183
OTHER EVEN SOMEONE'S IN IN.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:04.783
HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THEY

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.185
MAY BE RECEIVING OTHER OTHER

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.053
SERVICES AS WELL WHICH IS ALSO

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.154
WHAT SORT OF LAYERS ON TOP OF

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.923
THE TRICK UNITS OF THIS ANALYSIS

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.124
IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE I JUST

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.358
HAVE COSTS BUT THEN THEY ARE

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.260
GETTING OTHER SERVICES BUT BUT I

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:15.494
THINK.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:16.962
THAT'S A THAT'S A FAIR COMMENT

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.797
THAT ON AVERAGE A PERSON IN I

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:23.068
JUST US VERSES IN A NURSING HOME

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:25.003
IS CHEAPER.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.637
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS THANK

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:28.440
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:29.041
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- PUBLIC

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:32.644
COMMENT.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:33.212
RESEARCHER MEMBERS TO ANYONE

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:33.779
WITH THE CSU CALIFORNIA AND

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:34.780
STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.081
PROPOSAL -- THIS TO YOUR SON

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.116
SAID IS DEFINITELY A STEP BACK

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.618
FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AND I

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.986
THINK IT CONTINUES TO LEAD

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.354
DIETERS AS PROGRAM AS A WHOLE

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.289
KNOW THAT THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.057
PROVIDERS AND THE CLIENTS ARE

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:46.058
JUST.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.093
NOT IMPORTANT -- TO THE STATE WE

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.528
CONTINUE TO COME BACK HERE YEAR

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.330
AFTER YEAR AND WE WOULD MAINTAIN

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:51.830
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.866
PERMANENT RESTORATION TO THE 7%

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.801
AND WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU HIGHLY

THIS IS.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:47.946
ATTEMPTING TO BY PASS THE

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.715
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IF A

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.516
REDUCTION IS NECESSARY DUE TO AN

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.085
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN TWO YEARS

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.119
WE SHOULD DELIBERATE THAT

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.320
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.555
AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.190
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A VOTE AND

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.291
DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.392
NORMALLY DO FOR CUTS.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.728
AND NUMBER TWO IN RESPONSE TO

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.696
THE OBSERVATION THAT I JUST AS

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.498
IS THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAM

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.133
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.901
THAT'S TRUE THAT IS A BIG

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.704
PROBLEM AND IN FACT I WOULD URGE

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.272
THIS COMMITTEE TO ALSO ADOPT THE

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.641
REQUEST FOR THE ONE MILLION

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:17.109
DOLLARS FOR THE ACTUARIAL

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.044
ANALYSIS SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.213
THE WORK OF CREATING A WAY.

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.482
TO INTERVENE WITH MIDDLE CLASS

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:24.583

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.619
AND BECOME HSS RECIPIENTS SO

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.688
LET'S THINK HOLISTICALLY HERE

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.156
THAT IF WE ARE TRYING TO CONTROL

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.991
I JUST AS BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.259
ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT THAN JUST

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.861
THE REDUCING.

00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:38.330

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.107
REVISE HOW AND THIS ISSUE I

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.175

MY COLLEAGUES ARE MAKING AS THIS

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:01.953
CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT THIS

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.456
IS WHERE REDUCTIONS WILL HAPPEN.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.258
IN TWO YEARS I GET IT THAT IT'LL

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.193
BE SUBJECT TO DISCUSSIONS BUT AT

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.428
THE STARTING POINT OF THOSE

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.363
DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE FROM THE

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.364
PRESUMPTION.

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:16.702
THAT THIS -- THAT THE INCREASE --

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:18.837
ROLL BACK WOULD BE THE STARTING

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.672
POINT FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:22.307
THEN ONE LAST POINT ON THIS THIS

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:25.110
IS A SIGNIFICANT -- RETREAT FROM

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.978

THAT WE HAVE THAT -- THE

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.659
PARTICIPANTS ARE LIVING WITHIN

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.661

RAISING THE LINE OF QUESTIONING.

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:12.257
REGARDING THE COSTS THE REAL

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:14.259
COSTS THAT ARE BORN BY CONSUMERS

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:16.328
AND PROVIDERS IF THIS CAUGHT

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:17.662
ISN'T FULLY WORKED STORED IT'S

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.231
NOT JUST THE DE HUMANIZING

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.500
CHOICES THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.034
TO MAKE BECAUSE THE ALLOCATION

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:25.504
OF OURS IS BASED ON A NEAT.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.405

TALKING ABOUT HOSPITAL IS A AND

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:45.557
THOSE COSTS CAN BE LIMITLESS.

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:46.758
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REQUEST

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:47.659

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.917
MESSAGE AND ALSO.

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.018

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:54.219
THE GOVERNOR'S VISION FOR

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:18.963
COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTIES

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.999
DETERMINES HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.167
STATEWIDE.

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.069
BLOCK WILL CALL IT OUT TO THE

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.071
COUNTIES I'M IT'S NOT CLEAR AT

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.539
THIS POINT IF.

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.074
THAT ALLOCATION WILL BE MADE TO

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.343
THE COUNTIES SIMILARLY BASED ON

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.712
THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:37.281
CASES THAT CUSTOMIZABLE LEVEL AT

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:38.683
THE COUNTY. FOR FEDERAL BE

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.685
ALLOCATED -- SORT OF BASED ON

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:43.320
PRIOR YEAR LEVELS WITH SOME MORE

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:46.057
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS -- SO WE THINK.

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:47.591
AGAIN PROMISING STEP BUT BUT A

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:48.926
QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.362
HOW CUSTOMIZABLE TO COUNTY LEVEL

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.930
TO TO MAKE THE ALLOCATION.

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:55.766
OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.269
TALENTS OKAY YES SAYS ANDERSON I

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.070
THINK IT WAS SURE IT'S MY

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.771
UNDERSTANDING THAT -- REMAINING

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.707
CASE WORK IS THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:04.975
OF ALL THE CASES IN THE COUNTIES --

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:07.144
MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.913
GONNA CAR ABOUT TEN HOURS OF

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:11.482
TIME VERSUS FIVE HOURS A TIME

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:15.920
CAN YOU ARTICULATE.

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:16.620
WHAT DATA YOU'RE RELYING ON

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:17.288
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A?

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:18.422
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.390
ENTITIES ONE TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.291
ABLE.

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.425
TO SPEND THE APPROPRIATE TIME

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.595
WITH THESE -- WHAT THESE PEOPLE?

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.663
I I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.031
EXAMPLE WHERE WE WERE JUST

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.032
TALKING THAT WE DON'T LACKING

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.400
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WE DON'T

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.001
HAVE A LOT WE DID SURVEY

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:32.903
COUNTIES WE TOOK THEIR DATA WE

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.072
PROPOSED WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.841
LOGICAL YOU KNOW.

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:38.242
THE HARDER CASES TAKE MORE TIME

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:39.543
CASES TAKE CLASS I THINK IT'S A

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.778
STARTING POINT FOR THAT

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:43.247
CONVERSATION -- I UNDERSTAND

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.381
THAT COUNTIES FEEL PRETTY

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:45.883
STRONGLY THAT THE MOST INTENSIVE

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.919
CASES TAKE TEN HOURS A MONTH --

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.821
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.523
THAT WOULD TELL ME THAT'S NOT

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.258
TRUE OR THAT THAT'S EXACTLY

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:56.494
RIGHT EITHER -- AND WE'RE HAPPY

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.162
TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.864
EITHER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS OR

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.032
THROUGH THE LEARNING OF ACTUAL

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:04.568
EXPERIENCE GOING FORWARD.

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:08.072
OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:08.372
[inaudible]

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:11.742
AND THE BUT STILL ALSO A FOLLOW

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.810
UP ON SOME QUESTIONS THE LA --

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:13.477
HAD BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE I

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.378
GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.747
DEFINE INTENSIVE CASES RIGHT SO

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.749
BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING.

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:21.485
CLOSELY.

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:22.620
SO IS A DIRECTORY OF A BELL

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.420
SHAPED CURVE RATES OF INTENSE

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:25.022
CASES OF PEOPLE AT THE END THE

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:25.956
QUESTIONS FOR YOU CUT OFF HE

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:26.757
CURVE AND THEN -- IS THAT THE

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.058
AVERAGE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:28.793
ALWAYS BEAT OUT LIARS AND THEN

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:29.727
OF COURSE SMALLER COUNTIES WILL

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.762
HAVE FEWER PEOPLE AVERAGE OUT SO

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.097
YOU HAVE MORE VARIATION.

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.431
SO I THINK CERTAINLY GETTING

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:37.268
MORE DATA AND GETTING ACCURATE

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:38.302
DATA.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:38.969
WOULD BE HELPFUL I DO APPRECIATE

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:40.604
THE CONTINUED WORK OF THE

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.206
DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH THE

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.408
COUNTIES AND AND IN DOING THIS --

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:45.609
TO STAY WILL REMIND PEOPLE

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:49.246
BEFORE -- THE THE THE THE

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.681
DEPARTMENT THE COUNTIES EMBARKED

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:51.916
ON THIS WE WOULD JUST WORKING ON

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.851
A LINEAR MECHANISM WHICH

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.219
ACTUALLY UNDERMINE THE

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.954
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.689
DURING GOOD YEARS AND THEN WHEN.

00:40:58.756 --> 00:40:59.924
DAD YEARS CAME YOU KNOW WE

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.592
ALWAYS PLAY CATCH UP SO I REALLY

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:03.360
APPRECIATE THIS INVESTMENT AND

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.929
AND THEN ADMINISTRATION

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:05.696
RECOGNIZING THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.598
THAT WE PUT IN SOME MORE MONEY

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.500
DURING THE GOOD YEARS -- TO

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.801
MAINTAIN AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:13.103
WILL THEN BE READY -- IF THE

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.839
CASE LET'S GO UP WHEN --

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.174
ECONOMIC HARD TIMES A STRIKING

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.409
PEOPLE NEED THE HELP SO I REALLY

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:20.311
THINK -- THE PARCHMENT IN THE

00:41:20.377 --> 00:41:21.679
HARD WORK ON DOING THIS I THINK

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:23.681
THIS -- METHODOLOGY CERTAINLY

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.549
HAS PROMISED BY IF MAYBE YOU CAN

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.117
ADDRESS SOME OF THE AREAS

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:29.553
QUESTIONS ABOUT SO WE CREATED

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.488
FOUR CATEGORIES AND WILL HERE I

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.023
THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM --

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:33.891
THAN PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:39.063
COUNTIES ABOUT THIS BUT EXACTLY

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.265
AND ARE WE GOING TO EAT. FOR

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.466
EACH COUNTY DO WE SAY WELL HOW

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:43.033
MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN EACH

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.968
CATEGORY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.803
ALLOCATION IS TO TAKE STATE WIDE.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.370
DISTRIBUTION AND SAY WELL WE

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:47.037
JUST DIVVY UP BY THE NUMBER OF

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.839
CASES YOU HAVE SO WE'RE NOT

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.241
LOOKING AT WHAT'S AND COUNTY SO

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.243
WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.277
CURRENT DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.646
HOW YOU PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:58.382
WITH THIS.

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.416
FIRST LET ME START BY CLARIFYING

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:00.117
OR MARKET I MADE EARLIER I

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:00.751
MENTIONED THE EMPLOYMENT

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.786
SERVICES HAS TWO COMPONENTS THE

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.021
CASE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECT

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:05.222
SERVICES WE HAVEN'T DONE A

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:06.223
METHODOLOGY ON THE DIRECT

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.925
SERVICES PARTS I WANT TO BE

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.126
CLEAR WE'RE NOT FINISHED EVEN

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.194
THOUGH I SAID WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.562
THE METHODOLOGY.

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:13.864
SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT SAID -- I

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.366
I WOULD DâN THEN GO TO

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.200
ANSWERING THE QUESTION MY

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.601
ALLOCATION I THINK IT'S

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:21.105
PREMATURE TO TO REALLY HAVE HAVE

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.806
PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO THAT --

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:25.276
HISTORICALLY -- LEFT THE FUNDING

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.478
HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY CASELOAD FOR

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:28.379
ACTUATION SINCE SO ESSENTIALLY

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:32.116
WE'VE BEEN MARGINALLY BUDGETING

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:34.151
AND BASED ON CASELOAD MOVEMENT

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.252
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.120
ABOUT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHO

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:36.887
WEAR THAT CASELOAD IS

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.088
GEOGRAPHICALLY MOVING WE'VE

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.391
WE'VE ADJUSTED THOSE ALLOCATIONS.

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.692
I THINK CONCEPTUALLY THAT'S A

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.993
VERY LOGICAL THING HERE THE

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.762
POINT IS NOT TO OVER BUDGET SOME

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:46.630
PEOPLE IN UNDER BUDGET OTHERS WE

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:47.765
WANT TO BUDGET WHERE THE

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:50.000
CASELOAD FALLS -- THINGS LIKE AS

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.468
AS YOU WERE JUST ALLUDING TO THE

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.736
DEFINITION OF WHO FALLS IN WHICH

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.939
MARKET IS STILL NOT SETTLED

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:55.539
EITHER.

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:56.040
SO I THINK THERE'S SOME

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:58.175
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:01.745
HAPPEN FIRST -- CLICK.

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:03.347
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN BEING

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.649
UNFAIR TO ANYBODY AND EVEN IF WE

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:08.085
BUDGET ACCURATELY BASED ON WHERE

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.753
WE THINK THAT WORKLOAD IS GOING

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.287
TO BE.

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.855
THAT COULD BE A BIG OR A SMALL

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.490
CHANGE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COUNTY

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.092
AND SO WE THINK ABOUT.

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.727
RAMPS FOR THEM AND I OTHER

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.162
THINGS THAT PLAY INTO AN

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.164
ALLOCATION SO I I WOULD SAY

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.465
THERE'S A LOT THAT STILL IN PLAY

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:22.800
BEFORE I COULD TELL YOU HOW

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.034
EXACTLY THIS IS GONNA BE

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:25.569
ALLOCATED AND MANY MORE

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.972
CONVERSATIONS WOULD NEED TO

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:30.941
HAPPEN BASED ON THE FINAL BUDGET.

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:32.543
AND JUST TO TO CLARIFY A BIT I

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.645
THINK WE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.246
IT WOULD BE PREMATURE AT THIS

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:37.748
POINT IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD.

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:40.451
FULLY WORKED THROUGH -- THOSE

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:42.419
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WE RAISE THE

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.021
QUESTION MORE OF A LONG TERM

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:46.390
LACK -- AS WE EXTEND THIS NEW

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:47.992
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES METHODOLOGY

00:43:48.058 --> 00:43:49.693
AND BRING IN THE DIRECT SERVICES

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.928
COMPONENTS SO IT'S THE FULL

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.930
METHODOLOGY SOMETHING TO KEEP IN

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.365
MIND AS WE REEVALUATE JUST HOW

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:55.632
FAR THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.301
IN GOING IN PURSUING THIS MORE

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.370
CUSTOMIZABLE APPROACH -- IT'S IN

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:01.772
NO WAY CRITICISM OF DSS WITH THE

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.875
COUNTIES AT THIS POINT TO

00:44:04.942 --> 00:44:07.144
SOMETHING WE ONE FIVE AND I

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:07.978
REALIZE THIS IS A WORK IN

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:09.079
PROGRESS.

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.581
AND I ACTUALLY JUST WANTING

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:11.915
KNOWLEDGE APPRECIATE THE FACT

00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:13.283
WE'RE TAKING ON THIS WORK

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.686
BECAUSE AT LEAST AND WE'LL HEAR

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.588
VERY SHORTLY -- PLACE I THINK

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:19.523
THIS IS A I MEAN THIS IS AN

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.258
IMPROVEMENT.

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.893
TYPE THAT DON WHAT WE HAD BEFORE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.228
SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ALWAYS

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:26.930
IMPROVE THINGS EVEN MORE AND BUT

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:27.765
I I HOPE THAT.

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:29.967

SO AT LEAST.

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.907
MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT WILL HAVE

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:37.474
A BETTER SYSTEM THAN WE HAD

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.342
BEFORE.

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.276
I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL AND I

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.244
REALIZED ARE STILL ONGOING

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.479
DISCUSSIONS THE FIGURE OUT HOW

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:43.213
TO REFINE AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.982
IT'LL PROBABLY BE A MULTI YEAR

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.618
DISCUSSION I MEAN ABOUT TO READ

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:48.252

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.353
ALREADY BEEN.

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.468
THINK WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT A NEW

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.036
METHODOLOGY IT'S KIND OF A BLACK

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.571
A TORRID AND MAKE SURE IT'S

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:08.806

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:11.975

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.450
MILLION TOTAL FUND AND THE

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:30.286
NINETY EIGHT MILLION -- WOULD BE

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.288
FOR RELATED TO DDS I WANT TO

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.056
CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE A PORTION

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:35.691
OF THE TOTAL TWO HUNDRED JUST TO

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:37.827
UPDATE THAT IS ALSO REFLECTS THE

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.562
D. O. R. PORTION -- THAT YOU

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.864
WOULD BE HEARING AND IN THE SUB

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:42.498
COMMITTEE AS WELL.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.734
SO WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT JUST

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.634
TO REMIND YOU WITH THE

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.936
SUPPLEMENTAL PROPOSED

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:48.137
SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.373
IT'S FOCUSED ON TARGETED AREAS --

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:51.907
THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED -- BUT

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:54.009
AGAIN JUST TO REMIND YOU LOOKING

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.644
AT COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES ON

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:57.046
THE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS IN THE

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.081
VARIOUS CATEGORIES SUPPORTED

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.716
EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED LIVING.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.351
AND SO THE QUESTION THAT WAS --

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:03.986
THAT WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS WAS

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.454
TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE THE

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.223
GAPS YOU KNOW AND HOW DOES THAT

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.992
RELATE TO THE RIGHT STUDY AS WE

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.327
HAD DISCUSSED THAT WHEN WE'RE

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.462
LOOKING AT THE METHODOLOGIES AND

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.131
LOOKING AT THE PROJECTION FOR

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.199
THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.335
THAT IT WAS RELATED AND INFORMED

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:21.303
BY THE RATE STUDY SO WHEN WE

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.806
WERE ARE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL --

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.708
RATE ADJUSTMENTS IT IS

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:28.611
APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THOSE

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.745
TARGETED SERVICES.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.414
SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.717
TARGETED SERVICES AS IT COMPARES

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:35.951
TO IF THE RIGHT MODELS WILL WERE

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:37.820
FULLY IMPLEMENTED -- FULLY

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:40.256
IMPLEMENTED COMPARED TO WHAT OUR

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.258
CURRENT RATES ARE FOR THOSE

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.727
TARGETED AREAS WE WERE ACTUALLY

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:49.298
LET ME BACK UP.

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.600
OUR OUR TOTAL -- GREAT STUDY AS

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:52.301
COMPARED TO OUR CURRENT RATES

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.003
SHOWS A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT 40%

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.904
ON AN AVERAGE SO THAT'S A

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:55.805
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WITHIN THE

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.406
DIFFERENT SERVICE CATEGORIES AND

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.108
SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT ON AVERAGE

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:00.075
40%.

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:02.511
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:05.448
PROPOSAL AND WE INCLUDE THAT IN

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:07.683
OUR TOTAL YOU KNOW VIEW OF OUR

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.585
TOTAL RATE AS WE COMPARED TO THE

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.653
RATE STUDY?

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.988
THAT 40% IS THEN CHANGED TO A

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.424
DIFFERENCE OF 23%.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.393
SO AGAIN IT IT IS FOR ALL OF OUR

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.161
SERVICES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.496
THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.164
YOU IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.966
AT THE TARGETED SERVICES WITH

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.367
COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.602
WITH SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:29.205
SUPPORT SERVICES THOSE ARE THAT

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:31.140
THE SERVICES THAT DO YOU HAVE IN

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.275
COMPARISON WITH THE RATE MODELS

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:35.077
THE GREATEST KIND OF DELTA.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.979
IF YOU WILL BETWEEN CURRENT

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.748
RATES AND THEN THE PROPOSED --

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:41.584
SUPPLEMENTAL RTES SO IT'S IT'S

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.087
EVERYWHERE FROM ABOUT. 80% AND

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.422
THEN LIKE FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:48.224
ASSISTANT YOU KNOW IF THAT WAS

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.392
IMPLEMENTED IN THE RIGHT MODELS

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.894
IT WOULD BE LIKE AN ADJUSTMENT

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.529
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 5%.

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.297
SO YOU DO SEE AND IN SOME OF

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:56.665
THESE CATEGORIES IS THE GREATEST

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.600
ELEMENT.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:58.934
I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THOUGH

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.203
THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.338
WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT OUR

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.507
TARGETED PROJECTIONS WE'RE NOT

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.908
JUST LOOKING AT KIND OF THE

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.110
GREATEST GAP AS COMPARED TO THE

01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:09.011
RATE STUDY.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.746
WERE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT FOR

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.081
COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES THAT

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:13.616
THAT IS THE AREA THAT WE ARE

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.416
SEEN.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.851
THE REDUCTION OF ACTUAL

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:18.120
PROVIDERS -- NOT ONLY RELATIVE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.588
TO THE CONSUMER POPULATION BUT

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:21.323
JUST IN GENERAL WERE SEEN THAT

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.525
REDUCTION AND IN THE ARM LEVEL

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.893
PROVIDERS.

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:27.129
WE ALSO ARE ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.731
DIFFERENT MODELS THAT ARE

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:31.133
CONSISTENT WITH THE H. CBS.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.835
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.537
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.438
DOLLARS THAT WE WE CAPTURE AND

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.439
REIMBURSEMENTS.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.874
AND SO CERTAINLY WITHIN THOSE WE

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.209
HAD TALKED ABOUT THAT THEY ARE

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:42.411
IN ALIGNMENT WITH EIGHT CBS --

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:43.779
IT'S ALSO WITH OUR EMPLOYMENT

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.414
FIRST POLICY WITH A SUPPORTED

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.784
EMPLOYMENT.

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.286
THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK IT'S

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:50.986
REALLY IMPORTANTTHAT THAT I

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:51.620
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE POINT

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:51.820
OUT.

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:52.721
IS REALLY MOVING THAT NEEDLE

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:55.724
BETWEEN THE IN EQUITY BETWEEN

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.026
THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.494
AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.963
EXISTING RATES CERTAINLY PRESENT

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.998
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:06.001
THAT THE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:07.536
PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE ON THE

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.405
SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

IS GOING TO FULLY SHRINK THAT

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.542
GAP BUT IT IS DEFINITELY TAKING

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.210
A LOOK AT HOW TO MOVE HAT

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.211

CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE.

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.481
THE CONCERN THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.683
IN KIND OF KEEPING THAT KIND OF

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.318

FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL.

FIRST WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:11.026
IT DOES USE SOME OF THE FINDINGS

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.161
FROM THE RATE STUDY IN A

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.429
BENEFICIAL WAY AS THE DIRECTOR

JUST DESCRIBED FOR EXAMPLE

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.900
TARGETING USING THE THE GAPS IN

FUNDING IT COMPARED TO THE WHAT.

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.003
THE RATE RATES WOULD BE

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.438
WONDERFUL IMPLEMENTATION TO

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.506
TARGET THE RESOURCES AS WELL AS

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.741
TRYING TO REDUCE SOME OF THE

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:28.143
INEQUITIES ACROSS PROVIDERS WHO

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.212
PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICE IN THE

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.513
SENATE IN A SIMILAR REGION --

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.248
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME KEY

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.783
CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.552
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:37.619
AND WE KNOW THAT IT MISSES AN

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.421
OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDAMENTALLY

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:42.057

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.296
PRIMARY CONCERNS.

THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUND THE

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.466
AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROPOSED IS

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.768
RELATIVELY MODEST -- WHEN YOU

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.737
COMPARE IT TO THE RATE STUDIES

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.672
IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS IF YOU

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.307

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.409
MODELS IN NINETEEN TWENTY IT

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.143
WOULD INCREASE GENERAL FUND

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.778
SPENDING BY ONE POINT TWO

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:04.046
BILLION DOLLARS?

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.415
WHERE IS THIS IS A A? TWO

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.317
HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALIZED COST --

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:11.019
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN

ISSUE -- IN THIS IN THE HSS

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.031
ISSUE BUT THE PROPOSED SENSITIVE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:25.067
RATES RAISES CONCERNS AND I

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:25.601
WON'T.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.770
GO OVER ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.104

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:39.615
TIME.

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.651
PROJECT THESE ARE REALLY ONGOING --

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:45.554

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.664
ACROSS THE OTHER SERVICE

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:56.665
CATEGORIES SO.

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:58.133
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE THOSE AWAY

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.669
IT'LL HAVE A DESTABILIZING

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:05.440
AFFECT -- THIRD.

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.142

ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.753
TARGET THE INCREASES -- IS

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.388
PROBABLY A MORE COST EFFICIENT

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:20.889
APPROACH BUT IT DOES SORT OF

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.424
LEAVE OUT A LOT OF THE OTHER

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.092
PROVIDERS FROM ANY AMOUNT OF

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.263

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.536
YOU'RE PROBABLY AT A MUCH LOWER

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:47.803
PORTION.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.137
THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THOSE

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:52.174
SERVICES TOGETHER WOULD GET YOU

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.077
TO ABOUT 60% OF IF IT WAS FULLY

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.980
FUNDED IN THE RATE MODELS SO FOR

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:01.049
THE TARGETED SERVICES THAT YOU

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:01.583
IDENTIFIED FOR YOU ARGUED

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:02.517
RECOGNIZE AS A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:05.988
OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE NOT.

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.723
INCLUDED.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:08.490
IT'S A PARTIAL IT'S A IT WOULD

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.125
BE A PARTIAL IF THE RATE MODELS

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.493
WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR EVEN

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.394
JUST A SERVICES FOR THOSE

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.796
SERVICES AND AND OF NOTE.

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.231
THAT WHEN WE MEET.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.034
WITH WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.769
PROPOSAL SO THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:24.606
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT -- AS I HAD

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:26.908
MENTIONED THAT -- THE THE RATE

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.611
STUDY IF FULLY IMPLEMENTED ON AN

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.346
AVERAGE WOULD BE A GIVE OR TAKE

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.115
A LITTLE BIT OF ABOUT 40%

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:36.618
INCREASE TOTAL OF ALL IN SCOPE

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:37.719
SERVICES.

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:41.223
SO WITH THE INVESTMENT OF THE SO

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.591
THE RATE ADJUSTMENT THAT WE'RE

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.926
PROPOSING THAT THAT WOULD THEN

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:48.530
CHANGE THAT TO YOU YOUR YOUR

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:49.398
DELTA WOULD READ WOULD BE

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.899
REDUCED.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:54.236
HOWEVER YOUR THE SOME OF THE THE

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:56.872
TARGETED -- SERVICES THAT I

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:59.941
TALKED ABOUT CCAF TRANSPORTATION

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:00.542
YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE SUPPORT

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:04.513
SERVICES STILL ON TOTALITY WOULD

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.981
BE.

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:07.182
THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE THE THE

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.917
GREATEST INCREASE STILL THAT

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:10.085
WOULD BE NEEDED TO GET TO THE

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.820
RIGHT STUDY.

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.155
OKAY ABOUT IF THAT MAKES SENSE

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.290
OF YOU CLOSING THE GAP CLOSING

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.026
THAT GAP STILL HAVE A GAP IN THE

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:18.760
GAP.

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.062
UTILIZING THE GAFFE THAN IN SOME

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.296
WAYS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.498
IT IS IT'S MOVING THE NEEDLE IN

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:25.700
THE SENSE OF TRIED OF IT BECAUSE

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:29.271
IT WOULD BE A A PROPORTION OR A

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.739
RELATIVE PERCENTAGE.

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:34.509
AS IT IS BASED ON COMPARED IT TO

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.978
THE RIGHT STUDY SO WE STILL SO

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:41.983
WILD THOSE TARGETED AND GRANTED

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.452
AND FHA.

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.786
YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.455
IF IT WAS FULLY AT THE RATE

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.123
STUDY WAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THEY

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.791
HAVE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.326
INCREASE THAT WOULD OCCUR.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:52.894
MORE YOUR LARGER ONES WOULD BE

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:55.397
THE CCS AND SOME OF THE SUPPORT

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.265
SERVICES AND SO WHAT I'M JUST

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.333
SAYING IS THAT.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.969
YOU KNOW WITH THAT WITH THE

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:06.208
PROPOSAL TO INCREASE STILL AS

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:06.975
COMPARED TO THOSE.

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:07.909
SERVICES THAT ARE NOT WITHIN OUR

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:10.312
PROPOSAL THEY STILL WOULD HAVE A

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:13.248
GREATER DELTA BETWEEN.

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:16.084
THEIR NEW RATE AND OKAY IF THE

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.786
RIGHT STUDY WAS IMPLEMENTED

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:18.086
[inaudible]

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:22.424
AT OKAY.

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:23.892
IF I MIGHT ADD -- WHEN WE WHEN

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.427
WE SPOKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT A

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.828
COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND THEY

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.463
ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.665
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION SIX

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:31.533
HUNDRED PLUS?

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.268
MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.737
GENERAL FUND FOR THE RESIDENTIAL

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.639
FACILITIES.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.241
THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.042
AUGMENT SO JUST PUT IT IN THE

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:41.910
CAR OKAY.

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:43.411
RIGHT SO WHAT AND THAT'S JUST

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:44.646
FOR THE ONE CATEGORY THAT WE'RE

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.081
JUST TAKING THE ONES OF THE

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:49.718
BIGGEST ALT AND MAKING THE DELTA

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:51.219
A LITTLE SMALLER.

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:53.155
IN THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.423
CCF'S THAT IS ACCURATE.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:56.958
OKAY ALL RIGHT I JUST WANT TO

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:59.194
CLARIFY THAT CENTER STONE AND

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.763
FRY HAVE MORE COMMENTS LATER

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:02.197
THANK YOU LETTERS SO

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:02.497
[inaudible]

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.566
SO.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.334
IF WE'RE TO FULLY FUND THE LAND

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.969
FROM AN ENTITLEMENT ACT IN

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:08.703
SPIRIT.

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.605
IT WOULD COST US ABOUT ONE POINT

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.640
EIGHT BILLION.

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.742
IS MY UNDERSTANDING.

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:16.378
AND YOU'RE PROPOSING.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.313
THAT WE USE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.681
MILLION THIS YEAR.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:23.018
WHICH LEAVES -- SIGNIFICAN DOT

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.419
OF ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:28.490
DOLLARS.

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.125
YOU CAN ENHANCE THE THESE FOUR

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.893
CATEGORIES SO WERE REALLY UPSIDE

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.262
DOWN.

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.497
BUT WE'VE NEGLECTED.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.265
TO DO RATE INCREASES FOR OTHER

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.900
SERVICES THAT.

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.569
HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:44.639
TAKE CARE OF OUR DD COMMUNITIES --

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.241
THE ADVOCATES HAVE -- BEEN

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.043
ASKING.

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:49.778
IN LIEU OF YOUR FINAL COMMENTS

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:51.646
ON THE RATE STUDY IN A PERCENT

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:55.083
ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE.

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:55.584
WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.985
UNREASONABLE.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.019
BECAUSE WE'RE FINDING IT VERY

01:20:58.086 --> 01:20:59.221
DIFFICULT TO CONTRACT FOR

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.056
SERVICES OUT OF OUR OUR REGIONAL

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.291
CENTERS SO.

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:06.328
ASSUMING THAT YOU.

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:08.964
INCREASE THE FOUR CATEGORIES AS

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.532
YOU HAVE PROPOSED IF YOU WERE TO

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:13.602
ADD AN 8% INCREASE TO THE OTHER

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.804
SERVICES.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.671
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT.

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:18.540
KIND OF A BUDGET ENHANCEMENT YOU

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.041
WOULD -- NEED I'M I'M HEARING

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.443
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A BILLION

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:24.179
DOLLARS AND ABOUT RIGHT TO

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:30.118
FIFTEEN FIFTY MILLION.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.319
OUR POLICY IS WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:34.422
NUMBER WITH US RIGHT NOW BUT IF --

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:35.824
THAT'S A QUESTION WE CAN GO

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.158
AHEAD AD TAKE A LOOK AT AND

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.960
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:43.832
SO WE WE TASK YOU WHAT'S --

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:44.966
DURING A RAID STUDY.

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:45.533
AND THE PURPOSE OF THE RATE

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.670
STUDY WEST.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.439
TO PROVE THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.875
RATES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE IN

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:54.476
THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:55.577
GET.

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:57.646
THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND

01:21:57.712 --> 01:22:03.118
CERTAINLY DESERVE -- SIX SO WHY --

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.719
EVEN IN THE FOUR CATEGORIES TO

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:08.757
CHOOSE -- ENHANCED WHY WOULD WE

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.825
STILL SEE A DELTA.

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:11.860
WE CAN'T CLAIM THAT WE DON'T

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.061
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY COMING INTO

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:13.928
THE TREASURY BECAUSE WE SEE

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:15.597
OURSELVES HAVING TWENTY TWO

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:16.631
BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WE HAD

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:17.999
BUDGETED.

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:20.368
FOR SO WHY ARE WE FULLY FUNDING

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:21.770
THESE FOUR CATEGORIES AND

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.805
AUGMENTING THE OTHERS.

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.040
I SEE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:27.042
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN THE BUDGET

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.710
FOR ME AND I'VE BEEN.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.745
TUNING THE HORN FOR PROVIDER

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:31.413
RATES TO BE INCREASE FOR THE

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.214
PAST. FOUR YEARS AND I'VE BEEN

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.349
HERE.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.784
AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF OUR

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.920
REQUESTED FALLING ON DEAF EARS --

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:41.222
I WAS HOPING -- THAT TO THEIR

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:43.625
NEW GOVERNOR THAT MAYBE HE WOULD

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.527
SHOW MORE OF A SENSITIVITY. TO

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:49.931
THIS VERY FRAGILE POPULATION --

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.266
AND KIND OF PUT.

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.068
MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS AND

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:53.668
WANTING TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.637
THAT.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.772
REALLY DESPERATELY NEED SERVICES

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:58.073
[inaudible]

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:02.277
AND I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT.

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:05.146
WE HAVE MORE OF A NEED THAT OUR

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.649
ABILITY TO FUND SERVICES I THINK

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:08.283
YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.551
THAT.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.985
WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:11.586
WAITING FOR SERVICES THAT ARE

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.854
GETTING THEM.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:15.390
AND SO I STILL THINK THERE WERE

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:16.491
GROSSLY UNDERFUNDING.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.994
ARE PROVIDERS -- I DO UNDERSTAND

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:22.597
WHY IN THESE GOOD TIMES.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.300
THAT WE DON'T FULLY -- FUNDS

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:28.036
BASED ON THE EXPENSIVE TIME

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:29.537
CONSUMING STUDY THAT WE DID BUT

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:30.739
AT A MINIMUM.

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.776
WHY WOULD WE -- ADOPT THE 8% FOR

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.812
THE REMAINING ITEMS SO THAT WE

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.047
CAN GIVE SOME.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:40.315
CONFIDENCE IN THE IN THE

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.716
COMMUNITIES AT ALL OF US SERVE

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:44.319
THAT THE TV COMMUNITY IS GOING --

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:45.754
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.721
THEY COULD SEE SOME LIGHT AT THE

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.723
END OF THE TUNNEL. FOR MANY MANY

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:51.126
YEARS OF CUTBACKS AND AND AND

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.227
NON RESTORATION TROODON

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.995
RESTORATION EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:57.499
THE STATE.

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:18.646
PROGRAM SO THERE'S DIFFERENT.

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:20.481
PROJECTIONS THAT WERE WITHIN TE

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.517
RATE STUDY -- THAT WAS

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:24.218
INFORMATIVE AS FAR AS EVEN

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:26.220
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT HELPED

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:28.790
INFORM OUR PROPOSAL.

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.958
SO AS OUR PROPOSALS MOVING YOU

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:33.961
KNOW IS IS BEFORE YOU IS THAT WE

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:35.329
DIDN'T.

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:36.631
PUT THAT ON A SHELF TO SAY THAT

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:37.665
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE PART OF

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.701
IT BUT IT IS YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.303
A BIGGER DISCUSSION TO HAVE --

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.871
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OF

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:46.140
WHEN WE'RE GOING -- TO ADDRESS

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.209
ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT'S FOR

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.143
FOR ALL OF HIS TO HAVE

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.412
CONVERSATIONS -- BUT TO CONTINUE

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.047
TO WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:53.981
ANYBODY WHO WALKS THROUGH THE

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.249
DOOR OF A REGIONAL CENTER IS

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:56.651
RECEIVING SERVICES AND TO

01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:58.052
FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.387
GAPS ARE SO WE CAN HAVE.

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.788
KIND OF THAT THAT BROADER

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.290
DISCUSSION BUT WAS IN THE

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:04.559
PURPOSE OF THE READ STUDY.

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.260
IS TO IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS AND

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.829
QUESTION THOSE CAPS AND THEN YOU

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.564
LOOK AND FIND OUT THAT THE

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:10.398
REASON WHY YOU HAVE THOSE GAPS

01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:11.966
OF BECAUSE CONTRACTORS ARE TAKEN

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:14.202
THE WORK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WORK

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:14.869
FOR NOTHING.

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.604
AND SO IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.905
LEARNING FROM THE STUDIES.

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.173
AND WE'RE JUST GIVING LIP

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.175
SERVICE SAYS -- TO IN ORDER TO

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.410
PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT LEAST IN

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:23.878
AND STATEMENT ONLY BUT WHEN IT

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:25.880
COMES DOWN TO THE THE THE THE

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:27.782
THE THE TIRE OR TIRES MEETING

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:28.549
THE ROADS.

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:29.851
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:30.918
THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE ALONG

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.920
FUNDED APPROPRIATELY AND SO I I

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.989
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IN THE IN

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:35.756
THE IN THE GREATEST REVENUE

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.191
STREAM THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:37.925
EVER HAD.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.428
WHY DOES THE DEVELOPMENT A

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.996
DISABLED GET THE BACKSEAT IN THE

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:44.532
STATE BUDGET WHY ARE WE WORKING

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:45.967
TO FULLY FUND THIS PROGRAM?

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.335

I KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.238

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.640
FINANCES HEARING BUT I'M VERY

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:54.275
DISSATISFIED AS A CALIFORNIA.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:55.176
THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:56.777
THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.179
THAT WE OVERSEE WHILE WE WERE

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.747
ELECTED I DON'T THINK THIS IS

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:01.482
THIS IS A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS IS

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:02.783
A BIPARTISAN ISSUE.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:06.420
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.622

DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:12.159
COMMUNITY SHOULD HAVE IN THE

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:13.227
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:15.329
ATTENTION THEY'RE NOT GETTING WE

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:16.097

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:17.331
APPROACH TO PROVIDING THESE

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:18.733
ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND THAT'S

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:21.168

THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING WE

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:41.675
SHOULD BE DOING -- BUT THE IDEA

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.477
THAT WE WOULD BUILD INTO OUR

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.713
BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT THE THIS

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.816

DO YOU KNOW I CAN SEE THE

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:58.959
CHANGES IN.

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.027
AND BEHAVIOR TO CHANGE OUT THAT

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:01.595
THAT THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.431
YOU WANT TO SEE FOR ME ENTRIES

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:05.933

TEMPORARY BOB RIGHT -- SO I I

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:10.137
CERTAINLY HOPE -- THAT -- THE

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.672
ADMINISTRATION WILL AGREE I

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:12.239
BELIEVE.

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.140
WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.809
SHOULDN'T DO THAT I MEAN

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.477

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.682
WE AND WE WENT OVER THIS BEFORE

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.317
LET'S LET'S NOT SEND THE SIGNAL

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:26.487

IT'S ONE THING IF YOU HAVE A

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.329

COURSE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:25.946
GOING TO COME NOW THAT IT'S HERE.

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.014
AND WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.382
IT AND IS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:31.519
LEGISLATURE PASSED THE GOVERNOR

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.954
PRIOR GOVERNOR AGREED.

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:35.389
TO RIGHT THIS IS THE THIS IS

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:36.157
BEST A WAY AND THERE ARE SOME

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:36.857
IMPERFECTIONS WE HAD A

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.392
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN TERMS

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.994
OF HOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.429
RECOMMENDATION BUT THAT.

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:43.998
THIS WAS I THINK.

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.666
YEAH THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.401
WE WANTED TO TAKE RIGHT I MEAN

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:48.602
THIS DOES THE DEPARTMENT THAT.

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.237
WORK WITH THE VENDOR TO FIGURE

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.405
THIS OUT IT CETERA.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.907
AND IT'S HERE AND IT'S SAYING

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.508
THAT WE HAVEA BIG PROBLEM WE

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:55.743
HAVE A BIG GAP.

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.178
AND OBVIOUSLYIT'S UP TO US AS

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.946
THE POLICY MAKERS TO FIGURE OUT

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:01.148
HOW TO CLOSE THAT GAP AND HOW WE

01:37:01.215 --> 01:37:03.217
WANT TO PRIORITIZE BUT I THINK

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.119
THIS OF COMMITTEES VERY

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.954

ADDRESS SPEAK FOR THE ALL MY

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.590
COLLEAGUES BUT I THINK THAT

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:11.358
BUDGET COMMITTEE OVERALL.

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:12.159

SO -- I'D STATE WAS JUST FOR

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:17.998
THIS WAY THE EXPECTATION WILL BE

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:19.633
IS THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:23.637
AND SO FORTH AND I REALIZE HE'S

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:25.372
DISCUSSIONS ARE JUST GONNA BE

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.841
FOR ONE TIMES AND BUT WE WILL

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.843
TRY ONE AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.445
OF WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:32.913

THIS YEAR BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.041
QUITE FRANKLY WE ALSO BELIEVE

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.709
THAT THE SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:10.711
ACROSS THE BOARD AND WE'VE BEEN

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:13.047
A STRONG PROPONENT OF THE 8% TO

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:15.049
STABILIZE IN -- FUNDING FOR OUR

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:19.253
SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD THIS YEAR

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.923
ON THE QUESTION OF THE OF THE

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.525
SUNSET -- CLEARLY IT'S A

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.660
DESTABILIZING IMPACT AND I THINK

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:27.294
THE POINTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.129
MADE ON THAT IN MY LAST COMMENT

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:31.332
IS IF NOT NOW WHEN -- TWENTY

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:32.866
YEARS AGO WE HAD A SIMILAR STUDY

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:34.601
OF THE CITY GATES STUDY THAT

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.136
CAME OUT AT A SIMILAR TYPE TIME

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:37.471
IN OUR ECONOMY WHERE THINGS WERE

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:38.672
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:40.140
ONLY TO SEE A QUICK DOWNTURN IN

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:41.809
OUR ECONOMY AND THAT PARTICULAR

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.677
RATE STUDY SHELVED WE'RE VERY

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:44.445
CONCERNED OF COURSE HOW

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.146
SENSITIVE THE SYSTEM IS NOT

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:47.481
HAVING A GUARANTEE OF FUNDING

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:48.782
BUT HAVING AN ENTITLEMENT.

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.184
THAT WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.919
THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE MONEY AND

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:54.188
HAVE THE TIME AND HAVE THE DATA

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:55.956
TO SUPPORT WHAT THE SYSTEM IS

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:56.924
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW THAT WE

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:59.493
TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.661
THANK YOU.

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.696
THANK YOU WELCOME.

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:03.997
NANCY CHANCE FAMILY MEMBER

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:05.699
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHOICES

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:08.702
PERSON CENTERED SERVICES -- AND

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:10.137
THE CALIFORNIA.

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:14.074
THE PERSON CENTERED PARTNERSHIP.

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:14.675
AND THE PATH FOR COLLABORATIVE

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:15.843
OKAY.

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:16.677
I JUST WISH I AM GRATEFUL FOR

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.612
THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:20.814
OF FOR THE SERVICES THAT WERE

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:23.217
IDENTIFIED -- WE FEEL THAT AN

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.618
INDEPENDENT LIVING AND RESPITE

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.120
SERVICES NEED TO BE INCLUDED

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:27.888
WITH THOSE SERVICES AS THEY BOTH

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:30.090
ARE H. U. B. S. COMPLIANT AND

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.692
ALSO HELP PEOPLE TO REMAIN

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:32.726
LIVING IN THEIR OWN HOMES

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:35.295
INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW HAVING TO GO

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.297
TO A MORE RESTRICTIVE --

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:38.098
ENVIRONMENT.

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:40.801
I AM ALSO OPPOSED TO THE SUNSET

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.369
OF THE RATE INCREASE AND LESS

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:44.238
THAT SUNSET IS ACTUALLY TIED TO

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:47.608
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OF THE

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:47.908
RATE STUDY.

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.643
SO I MEAN IT WAS TIED TO THE

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.844
IMPLEMENTATION THEN THAT WOULD

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:51.745
BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.180
SPENDING MONEY NOW TO GET THERE

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:55.382
BUT THERE IS NO NO MENTION OF

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.317
THAT SO THAT'S CONCERNING -- AS

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:58.886
YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THESE

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:00.721
HEARINGS ARE -- OVER AND OVER

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:02.122

TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:09.596
AND QUITE FRANKLY I I I'M

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:10.497
ACTUALLY IS.

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:11.865
A SUPPORT LIVING PROVIDER I AM

01:41:11.932 --> 01:41:13.300
ALSO AN INDEPENDENT PROVIDER IN

A DAY SERVICE PROVIDER BUT AS OF

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:17.004
SUPPORT LIVING A PROVIDER AYE

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.604
I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:18.806
COMFORTABLE GIVING SALARY OR

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:19.807
RAISES.

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:20.874
IF I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE HIM

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.242
AWAY IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS I'M

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:23.877
REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT SO

THINGS THAT THE LA -- SAID AND I

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.420
THINK WE SHOULD HELP ALL

PROVIDERS IN SOME WAY LIKE

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:37.157

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:46.934
LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT WOULD

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.069

NANCY CHANCES MUST MENTION.

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:56.677
FIRST OF ALL JUST WANTED.

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:57.277
SHOW MY APPRECIATION TO THE

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.312

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:02.249
SAID.

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:03.350
IT'S JUST IMPORTANT FRAME THIS

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.219
DISCUSSION RESTORATIONS WHEN

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.854

THAT'S A REALLY A UP A REALLY

01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:18.532
TERRIBLE IN BALANCE IN POLICY

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:19.466
MAKING THAT I THINK THE

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:23.971
LEGISLATURE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY.

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:24.438
TO ADDRESS AS WELL AS

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.272
ADMINISTRATION.

FIRST WE PREACHER WITH THE

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.375
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON ON THE

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:05.872
CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND THE LIKE

01:44:05.939 --> 01:44:08.342
AND AND WE WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:09.176
ASK FOR A PERCENT ACROSS THE

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:09.876

THE RAGE THAT HE WILL HAVE AN

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:14.881
IMPACT ON WHAT THE RESULT IS FOR

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:17.351
THOSE RATES BUT NOW WHAT.

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:18.919
WE'RE SEEING IS A CHOICE OF

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:21.755
WHICH SERVICE CODE TO THE

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:23.156
QUESTION WAS RAISED.

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:24.725
IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.293
DESTABILIZATION THERE'S

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.728
ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT THIS

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.496
APPROACH WILL DESTABILIZE IF YOU

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:31.398
ARE A PROVIDER WHO IS PROVIDING

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:32.499

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:38.405
FOR ANOTHER.

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:39.539
AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEN ALL

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:41.174
MICRO PROBLEM IT'S A MACRO

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:43.143
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.244
HAVE A DESTABILIZING AFFECT

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:45.445
ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:47.347
SO THAT IS ONE OF OUR MAJOR

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:48.982
OBJECTIONS YOU CANNOT LEAVE OUT

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:51.184

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:23.303
SIX MONTHS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE

HUNDRED NINETY DOWN.

TO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THE MAIN

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.879
REASON IS MONEY WHAT THEY'RE

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.181
BEING PAID THE STAFF

BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:46.493
THE NUMBER ONE REASON THEY'RE

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.062
LEAVING IS BECAUSE OF MONEY HOW

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:50.497

AGENCY HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:53.767
IT MEANS WE LOST SEVENTY STAFF

MORE APPROPRIATE FOR RESOURCES

WHEN THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:42.315
THAT THEY'RE ALL IN NEED -- OF

01:48:42.382 --> 01:48:43.483
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THAT'S

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.118
WHY THE 8% ACROSS THE BOARD

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.519
WOULD E MORE BENEFICIAL.

01:48:46.586 --> 01:48:48.521

AGREEING TO IN THE BUDGET -- I

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.842

HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:18.311

CONTRACTS AS A WELL WILL

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.778
CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:25.912
ARE WE GOING TO BE CHANGING THE

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.614

PROTECTION -- AN EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:13.366
WOULD BE IF THERE IS AN INSTANCE

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:15.134

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:37.023
THE SAFETY IS THERE BUT THERE

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.491

REGIONAL CENTERS MAY NOT BE

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:44.497
AWARE OF IT.

01:56:44.564 --> 01:56:48.835

REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:49.529
OUTCOMES OF THOSE MEETINGS AND

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:51.531

01:58:11.184 --> 01:58:13.019
JUST LIKE TO MAKE FOUR POINTS

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:35.975
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IT

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:37.677
DOES INCREASE THE WORKLOAD OF

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.879
THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:41.013

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:56.362
SOME IDEAS FOR HOW TO

01:58:56.429 --> 01:58:58.164
COLLABORATE WITH THE REGIONAL

01:58:58.231 --> 01:58:59.465

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:24.944
ORGANIZATION OF PERSISTENTLY

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:26.679
DOES NOT IMPROVE.

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:27.146
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:28.614
CONSEQUENCES.

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:29.949
OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER PIECES

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:32.151
THAT.

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:33.619
YOU KNOW IT AT A PREVIOUS

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.688
HEARING -- WAS DISTURBED TO HEAR

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:37.256
SOME PEOPLE INDICATE THERE'S

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:38.858
SOME ISSUES AROUND PEOPLE THEN

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:42.128
FEEL FREE TO EXPRESSED PROBLEMS --

DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.333
MECHANISMS BY WHICH IF SOMEONE

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.634
DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.603
REPORTING WHAT THEY PERCEIVE THE

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:52.204
PROBLEMS AND AGAIN THAT NOW

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:53.673
REQUIRES INVESTIGATION WE DON'T

02:01:53.739 --> 02:01:55.941
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE REALITY IS.

02:01:56.008 --> 02:01:57.009
THAT THERE ARE WE HAVE THOSE

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:59.945
MECHANISMS -- THE THAT SAID

SERVICES FROM SO -- WITHERED AS

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:10.322
MECHANISM FOR GOING THROUGH

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.525
THE STATE -- ARE IN A BUG'S MEN

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.660
TYPE SYSTEM WHERE BASICALLY THEY

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:16.228
KNOW THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:17.663

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:20.933
OVER.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.335
OUR IT HAS RELATIONSHIP DOWN THE

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:25.337
RELATIONSHIP THAT THEN MAKES

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:27.173
THAT THE BASICALLY THE PEOPLE

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:29.208
NEED TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THINGS --

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.410
WITHOUT FEAR -- OBVIOUSLY THEY

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:33.679
NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED WE DON'T

02:02:33.746 --> 02:02:34.513
TO STILL AT THAT AND THE FINAL

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.182
THROUGH THE PROBLEM IS BUT I

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:44.323
THINK AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY --

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:46.125
I THINK SOUNDS IT SEEMS TO ME

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:46.759
I'M HEARING A LOT AND I'M VERY

02:02:46.826 --> 02:02:47.693
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO IS THAT

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:55.267
THAT.

02:02:55.334 --> 02:02:57.269
THE THE DISCUSSION THAT WE WOULD

02:02:57.336 --> 02:02:58.170
BE HAPPY WITH REGIONAL CENTERS

02:02:58.237 --> 02:02:59.271
THIS COMES ALSO WITHIN THE

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.440
REORGANIZATION IS REALLY KIND OF

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:01.640
THAT.

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:03.642

OR A DRESSING.

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:22.428
UP A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IF IF

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:24.230

REASONS IN A REGIONAL CENTERS --

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:17.443
BUT I ALSO PERCEIVES -- THAT WE

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:19.378
MAY HAVE -- AND UNDERLYING

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.547
CHALLENGE WITH TYPICALLY PEOPLE

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:22.915
FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES --

02:05:22.982 --> 02:05:24.216
THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:26.252
SYSTEM WE ALREADY KNOW THEIR

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:27.853
STIGMA ISSUES AROUND DOLLY

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.722
MENTAL HEALTH BUT DEVELOPMENTAL

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:32.391
ISSUES GET TIED UP INTO THAT --

02:05:32.458 --> 02:05:33.759
THEN THERE'S LANGUAGE BARRIERS

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.961
CULTURAL BARRIERS -- PEOPLE'S

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:39.331

AND AND DOING THEIR BEST -- BUT

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.054
I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO LOOK

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:04.323
STRUCTURALLY AT THE NATURE OF

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:05.357

COMMUNITIES DEFER YEAH AND AND

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:09.728
AND DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND

02:06:09.795 --> 02:06:12.197
EXPERIENCES -- IN MANY WAYS

02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:13.565
ACTUALLY WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:15.034
THE FACT THAT WE THESE

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:16.368

ALSO MEANS PEOPLE COME FROM A

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:21.740
LOT OF DIFFERENT OTHER PLACES

02:06:21.807 --> 02:06:22.808
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT KIND

02:06:22.875 --> 02:06:24.410
OF EXPERIENCE OUR EXPECTATION

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:25.177

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:21.339
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER.

02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:22.140
NOW WITH THE CLOSURE THE

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:24.175
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THERE'S A

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:28.179
VERY LIMITED WE ABILITY -- TO

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:31.015

CANYON SPRINGS TEMPORARILY FOR

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:38.489
TEN BEDS FOR IT UNDER THE STARS

02:26:38.556 --> 02:26:40.291
SERVICES THIS IS NOT THE AREA

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:42.760
MUCH I'M TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS

02:26:42.827 --> 02:26:44.061
EXPANSION FOR CANYON SPRINGS.

02:26:44.128 --> 02:26:45.696
THIS IS VERY SPECIFIC IN THOSE

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.732
REALLY RARE INSTANCES WERE

02:26:47.798 --> 02:26:48.799
TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH

02:26:48.866 --> 02:26:50.668
VERY VERY COMPLEX NEEDS RIGHT

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:51.269
NOW.

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:54.338
THAT AS FAR AS TRYING TO HAVE A

02:26:54.405 --> 02:26:55.640
TIME IN WHICH STABILIZATION AND

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:57.475
TREATMENT IS EXTENDED LONGER

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.010

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:08.619
LIMITED BUT IT DOES GIVE US A

02:27:08.686 --> 02:27:10.388

SEE THIS LANGUAGE -- QUITE LATE

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.747
AS A WAS AND PARTICULARLY SINCE

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:13.050
IT WAS -- IS A REVERSAL OF A

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:15.353
VERY CLOSELY NEGOTIATED --

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:18.222

WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE --

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:27.365

INCREASING THE CAPACITY.

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:25.816

02:31:03.053 --> 02:31:05.089
THAT THIS WOULD BE AN AREA IN

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:06.824
WHICH WE COULD ACCESS AS FAR AS

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.392
ADMISSION INTO CANYON SPRINGS

02:31:08.459 --> 02:31:09.527

NO ONE ACTUALLY GETS PENALIZED

THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT AND THEN

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:49.746
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLE

02:49:49.812 --> 02:49:52.048

THAT'S THE PREVIOUS SO I

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:08.097
APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE DOING SOME

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:09.966
SORT OF THESE ADS -- BUT LET US

02:50:10.033 --> 02:50:11.734
RECOGNIZE THAT A JURY SPENDING

02:50:11.801 --> 02:50:14.571
25% ON THE PREMIUMS AND THEN YOU

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:17.006

NAY THROUGH THE CROSS YEAR ON

02:50:48.304 --> 02:50:49.872

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:51.107

LEADERSHIP AND SAYING THAT BY

02:50:55.178 --> 02:50:56.779
THINK WE DO NEED TO DO MORE.

02:50:56.846 --> 02:50:58.481
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE MARRYING

02:50:58.548 --> 02:51:00.917

MANDATE SELL -- SO AGAIN -- AS I

02:51:06.422 --> 02:51:07.590
THINK WE NEED TO REALLY THINK

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:10.326
MORE ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT.

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:11.561

02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:18.668
CHALLENGING POSITION.

THE IMPROVEMENTS WE EE.

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:39.122
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE

02:51:39.188 --> 02:51:41.090
ON THE SUBSIDY SIDE TO MAKE THE

02:51:41.157 --> 02:51:42.692

REGARDING FEES SUBSIDIES FOR

02:52:01.310 --> 02:52:03.346
THOSE UNDER.

02:52:03.413 --> 02:52:07.216
THE UP OVER THE TWO WAS A 2100%

02:52:07.283 --> 02:52:09.318

COULD BE IN IT IT SEEMS LIKE

02:52:13.423 --> 02:52:14.090
THERE'S NOT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT

02:52:14.157 --> 02:52:17.427
OF SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD BE QUITE

02:52:17.493 --> 02:52:22.265

IN THIS LANGUAGE.

02:52:36.112 --> 02:52:37.580
HOWEVER WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW WE

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:38.715
COULD IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:40.850

NON PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND SO

02:59:08.170 --> 02:59:09.572
FORTH HAS INCREASED PRETTY

02:59:09.638 --> 02:59:11.774
MARKEDLY AND SO WE WE THINK WE

02:59:11.841 --> 02:59:13.476
FIND THE EVIDENCE OVERALL MIXED

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:14.877
ON A STATE WIDE SHORTAGE.

02:59:14.944 --> 02:59:16.312
WE DO FIND HOWEVER REGIONAL

02:59:16.378 --> 02:59:18.214
DISPARITIES -- AMONG MENTAL

02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:20.382
HEALTH PRESS -- PROVIDERS SO

02:59:20.449 --> 02:59:23.085
ESPECIALLY IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY --

02:59:23.152 --> 02:59:26.755
AND AS WELL AS THE INLAND EMPIRE

02:59:26.822 --> 02:59:28.124
THOSE ARE -- DO APPEAR TO BE

02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:29.425
EXPERIENCING MORE ACUTE

02:59:29.492 --> 02:59:30.693
SHORTAGES I SHOULD KNOW THAT ON

02:59:30.759 --> 02:59:32.328
A STATEWIDE BASIS WE DO FIND

02:59:32.394 --> 02:59:33.896
MORE EVIDENCE OF A OF A

02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:40.669
PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE -- WE ALSO

02:59:40.736 --> 02:59:41.270
FIND THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY

02:59:41.337 --> 02:59:41.904
AS TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING

02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:43.472
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL --

02:59:43.539 --> 02:59:44.974
ONE PIECE OF DATA THAT WE LOOKED

02:59:45.040 --> 02:59:47.176
AT WAS WHERE IN WHERE RECIPIENTS

02:59:47.243 --> 02:59:50.012
OF WET AWARDS WORK AFTER THEIR

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:51.380
AFTER -- THEIR SERVICE

02:59:51.447 --> 02:59:53.115
OBLIGATIONS COMPLETE AND FOUND

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:54.717
THAT THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A

02:59:54.783 --> 02:59:56.252
VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP.

02:59:56.318 --> 02:59:59.455
BETWEEN THE THAT WHERE THEY WORK

02:59:59.522 --> 03:00:00.089
AND WITH THE REGION'S THE STATE

03:00:00.156 --> 03:00:01.190

SOME OPTIONS AS WELL FOR

03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:06.762
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FIRST

03:00:06.829 --> 03:00:08.097
WOULD BE TO TAKE PAUSE AND

03:00:08.164 --> 03:00:09.632
IDENTIFY THE STATE'S NEEDS IN

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:10.699
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

03:00:10.766 --> 03:00:13.702
STRATEGIES -- FOR FOR ADDRESSING

03:00:13.769 --> 03:00:15.771
ANY STATEWIDE A REGIONAL MENTAL

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:17.039
HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES.

03:00:17.106 --> 03:00:19.608
ANOTHER WOULD BE -- TO SCALE

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:22.211
BACK FUNDING -- AND POTENTIALLY

03:00:22.278 --> 03:00:24.513
HERE REQUIRE LOCAL CONTRIBUTION

HISTORICALLY -- MENTAL HEALTH

03:00:26.315 --> 03:00:27.983
SERVICES ACT FUNDING THAT WAS

03:00:28.050 --> 03:00:30.819

AVAILABLE UNDER THE MHSAA SO WE

03:00:40.362 --> 03:00:41.597
THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

03:00:41.664 --> 03:00:43.365
CONSIDER EITHER ALLOWING OR

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:45.668
REQUIRING LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

03:00:45.734 --> 03:00:46.969

HEALTH WORKFORCE AND SO THEY DO

03:00:53.075 --> 03:00:55.010
RECEIVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:56.545
BASIS TO DO SO -- AND THEN

03:00:56.612 --> 03:00:58.080
ANOTHER OPTION WOULD JUST BE TO

JUST A FEW DOLLARS A TO THE WEB

03:02:05.214 --> 03:02:06.482
PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE CHANGING

STATUTORY LANGUAGE.

03:02:07.149 --> 03:02:08.884

AND COUNTIES NOT EXPECTING TO BE

03:02:21.930 --> 03:02:23.766
ASKED TO MATCH ANY NEW FUNDING --

03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:25.634
AND COUNTIES HAVE LIKELY NOT

03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:27.636
BUDGETED FOR THIS CLASS AND

03:02:27.703 --> 03:02:28.704
THOSE DOLLARS MIGHT BE ALREADY

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:32.207
EARMARKED FROM -- FOR OTHER

03:02:32.274 --> 03:02:35.044
MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.

03:02:38.113 --> 03:02:40.716
UP SO ACTION IS SO IN TERMS OF

03:02:40.783 --> 03:02:43.452
OF WE'VE HAD WHAT.

03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:44.653

THIS WILL BE THE THIRD FIVE YEAR

03:02:47.656 --> 03:02:48.724
PLAN STRAIGHT TO THE THIRD FIVE

03:02:48.791 --> 03:02:54.930
YEAR OKAY SO THAT YEAH SO -- AND

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:55.898
I KNOW WE DID YOUR FAMILY OF

03:02:55.964 --> 03:02:56.532
SOME OF SO I THINK YOU KNOW I

03:02:56.598 --> 03:02:57.566
THINK -- VALUATIONS GOING TO BE

03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:58.167
IMPORTANT AND ACTUALLY LOOKING

03:02:58.233 --> 03:02:58.701
NOT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S

03:02:58.767 --> 03:03:00.202
MULTIPLE COMPONENTS IN HERE.

03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:02.071
LIKE SUB CONSERVE SO FOR EXAMPLE --

03:03:02.137 --> 03:03:03.405
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO

03:03:03.472 --> 03:03:07.509
UNDERSERVED AREAS RIGHT.

03:03:07.576 --> 03:03:09.511
SORRY MY BACKGROUNDS AND WORK

03:03:09.578 --> 03:03:10.412
FORCE I DID WORKFORCE RESEARCH

03:03:10.479 --> 03:03:11.747
SO.

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:12.648
CHALLENGES LIKE YOU FEEL

03:03:12.715 --> 03:03:13.515
SOMETHING AS YOU WILL SAY WELL

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:14.583
LET'S JUST SHOVE AS MANY PEOPLE

03:03:14.650 --> 03:03:15.250
AS WE CAN RIGHT INTO THE SYSTEM

03:03:15.317 --> 03:03:17.052
BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE A SHORTAGE

03:03:17.119 --> 03:03:18.387
BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:20.089
WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE FOR DO THEY GO

03:03:20.155 --> 03:03:22.691
AND PUT A GO NOT SURPRISINGLY.

03:03:22.758 --> 03:03:25.527
IS DEPENDENT ON THE LABOR MARKET

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:27.663
FOR THAT SO YOU CAN IF YOU DON'T

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:28.964
IF IT UNDERSERVED AREAS DON'T

03:03:29.031 --> 03:03:30.799
HAVE POSITIONS.

03:03:30.866 --> 03:03:31.567
AND IT'LL HAVE COMPETITIVE

03:03:31.633 --> 03:03:33.068
POSITIONS COMPARED TO OTHER

03:03:33.135 --> 03:03:35.137
AREAS THEN PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO

03:03:35.204 --> 03:03:37.973
STAY EVEN IF YOU SELL.

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.209
ANY YET RIGHT SO I MEAN THINK

03:03:40.275 --> 03:03:41.543
ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR

03:03:41.610 --> 03:03:43.579
A JOB AND YOU GO OKAY PAGE HERE

03:03:43.645 --> 03:03:50.185
AND THIS KIND OF YOUR LIVER HERE.

03:03:50.252 --> 03:03:51.253
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:53.789
FACTORS GO IN PLACE SO -- AND SO

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:55.791
I THINK. FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE

03:03:55.858 --> 03:03:57.993
LOOKS AT IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT --

03:03:58.060 --> 03:03:59.027
WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW DO LOAN

03:03:59.094 --> 03:04:00.229
REPAYMENT PROGRAMS FAIR RIGHT SO

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:01.263
FOR EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL HEALTH

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:01.797
SERVICE CORPS.

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:03.165
USED TO PUT THE EMPHASIS ON

03:04:03.232 --> 03:04:03.832
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THE PAID PEOPLE

03:04:03.899 --> 03:04:04.800
UP FRONT NAY REALIZE THAT

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:06.034
ACTUALLY TO GET PEOPLE TO STAY

03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:07.102
YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME THEY DO

03:04:07.169 --> 03:04:08.771
THEIR APPLICATION WAS ACTUALLY

03:04:08.837 --> 03:04:10.272
TO GET LOAN REPAYMENT RIGHT.

03:04:10.339 --> 03:04:11.774
AND AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT

03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:13.409
BEYOND THE PIPELINE HOW THE

03:04:13.475 --> 03:04:14.576
PROVIDE THE KIND OF SUPPORTS FOR

03:04:14.643 --> 03:04:16.845
PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE

03:04:16.912 --> 03:04:19.448
AND THE MOST UNDERSERVED AREAS.

03:04:19.515 --> 03:04:20.783
SO SOLEMN HOPING THAT IS WE'RE

03:04:20.849 --> 03:04:24.286
LOOKING AT THIS THAT THERE'S A

03:04:24.353 --> 03:04:25.487
SERVER.

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:27.289
THIS BROADER COUNTY LOOKING AT

03:04:27.356 --> 03:04:28.924
THE KIND OF THAT THE AND ALSO

03:04:28.991 --> 03:04:30.025
LOOKING AT THE DATA ABOUT WHAT

03:04:30.092 --> 03:04:30.526
WILL WHICH PARTS OF THE

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:30.826
PROGRAMMER.

03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:32.394
ARE MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL RAID

03:04:32.461 --> 03:04:35.030
SO I THINK LA -- JUST MENTION

03:04:35.097 --> 03:04:35.831
THE BILL FORTY PEOPLE INTO

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:37.599
PRACTICING WHAT WHAT'S THE

03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.501
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT RT RT

03:04:39.568 --> 03:04:40.702
PRACTICING IN THE UNDERSERVED

03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:42.037
AREAS ARE NOT.

03:04:42.104 --> 03:04:44.206
OF SOME OF THAT MAY REQUIRE SOME

03:04:44.273 --> 03:04:46.909
TIME IT'S FINE TUNING OF THE THE

03:04:46.975 --> 03:04:47.810
THE STRATEGY RIGHT AND THINK

03:04:47.876 --> 03:04:49.044
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO

03:04:49.111 --> 03:04:50.879
PEOPLE PRACTICING IS THAT JOBS

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:52.381
IS IT ACTUALLY SOMETIMES CAREER

03:04:52.448 --> 03:04:54.049
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPOUSES.

03:04:54.116 --> 03:04:54.983
I MEAN THAT'S A FACTOR IN

03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:57.820
WORKFORCE MOST KNOWN PEOPLE GET

03:04:57.886 --> 03:04:58.454
MAIL.

03:04:58.520 --> 03:04:59.488
FORM RELATIONSHIPS MAYBE GET

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:00.823
MARRIED THEY USUALLY NEED TO

03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:02.925
HAVE A CAREER FOR BOTH PEOPLE.

03:05:02.991 --> 03:05:04.626
AND SO HOW DO YOU TREAT THOSE

03:05:04.693 --> 03:05:06.962
OPPORTUNITIES THAT -- IT'S SO

03:05:07.029 --> 03:05:08.864
THAT COULD BE A DRIVING FACTOR --

03:05:08.931 --> 03:05:10.866
WHAT KIND OF JOB SUPPORT SO WHAT

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:12.768
IS IT HOW GOOD IS THE PUBLIC YOU

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:14.403
KNOW AND FOR SEE HOW GOOD IS THE

03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:15.704
INFRASTRUCTURE?

03:05:15.771 --> 03:05:17.206
FOR HIRING PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:18.907
AREAS RIGHT SO USE NOW YOU SPENT

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.242
THE TIME YOU TRAIN YOUR SOCIAL

03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:21.477
WORKER YOU CHANGE PSYCHIATRISTS

03:05:21.543 --> 03:05:22.778
WHATEVER.

03:05:22.845 --> 03:05:24.313
IS IS THEIR COMPETITOR TO

03:05:24.379 --> 03:05:25.747
COMPETITORS ASIANS FOR THEM TO

03:05:25.814 --> 03:05:26.982
DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:28.784

03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:36.885
LOWER THAN IT WAS IN JANUARY --

03:11:36.952 --> 03:11:37.953
ALL THE MAJOR CHANGES WE'RE

03:11:38.019 --> 03:11:39.955
GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT LATER

03:11:40.021 --> 03:11:41.489
TODAY SO I WON'T LIST THOSE.

03:11:41.556 --> 03:11:44.359
THE ONE ADDITIONAL ITEM ALTHOUGH

03:11:44.426 --> 03:11:46.294
IT'S NOT PART OF THE BUDGET.

03:11:46.361 --> 03:11:47.963
ITSELF AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE

03:11:48.029 --> 03:11:49.931
IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME WE DID

03:11:49.998 --> 03:11:51.733
ALSO RELEASE ARE.

03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:53.401
FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR THE CARVE

03:11:53.468 --> 03:11:55.337
OUT OF THE PHARMACY SERVICES

03:11:55.403 --> 03:11:57.572
BACK TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- IT IS

03:11:57.639 --> 03:11:58.874
ESTIMATED AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.542
TO BE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE

03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:01.676
MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:04.880
SAVINGS -- I WILL NOTE THAT WE

03:12:04.946 --> 03:12:06.681
DID NOT ASSUME ANY SAVINGS

03:12:06.748 --> 03:12:08.183
RELATED TO THREE FORTY B..

03:12:08.250 --> 03:12:09.451
IN THIS ESTIMATE JUST SO THAT

03:12:09.517 --> 03:12:12.420
IT'S CLEAN AND CLEAR AND I KNOW

03:12:12.487 --> 03:12:12.921
THERE HAD BEEN CONCERN

03:12:12.988 --> 03:12:13.889
PREVIOUSLY.

03:12:13.955 --> 03:12:15.423
THAT MOST THE SAVINGS WOULD BE

03:12:15.490 --> 03:12:17.092
COMING FROM THREE FORTY B. SO

03:12:17.158 --> 03:12:18.260
ESSENTIALLY AS A PART OF THIS

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:20.095
ESTIMATE -- WE JUST AT THIS

03:12:20.161 --> 03:12:21.863
POINT ASSUMES.

03:12:21.930 --> 03:12:23.198
THE PAYMENTS WOULD STAY THE SAME

03:12:23.265 --> 03:12:25.367
OBVIOUSLY TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE

03:12:25.433 --> 03:12:26.835
THE FUNDING STILL FLOW THAT WAY

03:12:26.902 --> 03:12:28.003
THE LEGISLATURE.

03:12:28.069 --> 03:12:29.771
AND ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE TO

03:12:29.838 --> 03:12:31.840
DEVELOP SOME TYPE OF PLAN TO

03:12:31.907 --> 03:12:33.708
HAVE THE MONEY STAY WITH THEM --

03:12:33.775 --> 03:12:35.477
IF OTHERWISE OTHERWISE THERE

03:12:35.543 --> 03:12:36.645
WOULD BE SAVINGS FROM THREE

03:12:36.711 --> 03:12:37.545
FORTY B. AND THEN THE NUMBER

03:12:37.612 --> 03:12:40.282
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

03:12:40.348 --> 03:12:42.717
THAN -- THREE NINETY THREE YOU

03:12:42.784 --> 03:12:44.252
HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE

03:12:44.319 --> 03:12:47.622
INCREASE IN THE SAVINGS -- FOR

03:12:47.689 --> 03:12:48.690
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS REALLY

03:12:48.757 --> 03:12:51.426
RELATED TO FOR ISSUES -- THERE

03:12:51.493 --> 03:12:53.628
WE'VE DELAYED REPAYING -- SOME

03:12:53.695 --> 03:12:55.330
TITLE -- TWENTY ONE FUNDS THAT

03:12:55.397 --> 03:12:57.666
WE A CLAIMS BEFORE AS WERE STILL

03:12:57.732 --> 03:12:59.100
WORKING WITH CMS.

03:12:59.167 --> 03:13:00.568
ON THEN EXCHANGING THAT FOR

03:13:00.635 --> 03:13:01.937
TITLE.

03:13:02.003 --> 03:13:03.171
NINETEEN WE DID HAVE INCREASED

03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:06.608
DRUG REBATES -- WE HAD FEWER

03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:08.343
DEFERRALS FROM CMS AND THEN WE

03:13:08.410 --> 03:13:10.478
DID HAVE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE

03:13:10.545 --> 03:13:14.015
TIMING OF RETROACTIVE MANAGED

03:13:14.082 --> 03:13:16.284
CARE RATE ADJUSTMENTS

03:13:16.351 --> 03:13:16.584
[inaudible]

03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:17.919
OKAY HELLO [inaudible]

03:13:17.986 --> 03:13:19.821
IT'S MILLION.

03:13:19.888 --> 03:13:20.322
RYAN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE

03:13:20.388 --> 03:13:21.790
ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THE LAST

03:13:21.856 --> 03:13:23.792
SEVERAL DAYS WE HAVE BEEN --

03:13:23.858 --> 03:13:25.126
CAREFULLY LOOKING THROUGH AND

03:13:25.193 --> 03:13:26.828
THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:28.063
REVISION MEDI CAL ESTIMATE.

03:13:28.129 --> 03:13:29.130
AND DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR

03:13:29.197 --> 03:13:32.767
CONCERNS AT THIS TIME -- HOWEVER

03:13:32.834 --> 03:13:34.169
WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

03:13:34.235 --> 03:13:37.339
THE ESTIMATED SPENDING IN TWO

03:13:37.405 --> 03:13:37.939
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS

03:13:38.006 --> 03:13:39.474
NOW ABOUT THREE POINT THREE

03:13:39.541 --> 03:13:41.443
BILLION DOLLARS LOWER.

03:13:41.509 --> 03:13:43.044
THAN AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR --

03:13:43.111 --> 03:13:44.546
WHEN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:13:44.612 --> 03:13:45.847
NINETEEN BUDGET ACT WAS APPROVED --

03:13:45.914 --> 03:13:48.383
AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW --

03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:50.552
VERY LARGE ANTICIPATED CHANGES

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:52.487
IN THE MEDICAL BUDGET HAVE

03:13:52.554 --> 03:13:54.222
BECOME RELATIVELY COMMON -- IN

03:13:54.289 --> 03:13:55.690
LARGE PART DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY

03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:58.193
OF THE PROGRAM -- AND THIS HAS

03:13:58.259 --> 03:13:59.060
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

03:13:59.127 --> 03:14:00.428
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO

03:14:00.495 --> 03:14:02.430
FORMULATE AND PURSUE LONGER TERM

03:14:02.497 --> 03:14:03.798
FISCAL PLANS IN ALIGNMENT WITH

03:14:03.865 --> 03:14:04.833
ITS PRIORITIES.

03:14:04.899 --> 03:14:08.036
AND ALSO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF

03:14:08.103 --> 03:14:09.704
THE PROGRAM -- WOULD LIKE TO

03:14:09.771 --> 03:14:10.739
REITERATE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS

03:14:10.805 --> 03:14:12.107
FROM EARLIER IN THE YEAR ON A

03:14:12.173 --> 03:14:13.808
PROPOSAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

03:14:13.875 --> 03:14:15.410
HAS PUT FORWARD AND CONTINUES TO

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:16.678
PROPOSE.

03:14:16.745 --> 03:14:18.246
THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING --

03:14:18.313 --> 03:14:20.281
AND POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT

03:14:20.348 --> 03:14:22.817
TO BETTER TRACK -- CASH FLOWS

03:14:22.884 --> 03:14:24.619
AND AND ESTIMATES IN THE MEDI

03:14:24.686 --> 03:14:25.787
CAL PROGRAM.

03:14:25.854 --> 03:14:26.654
AND ALSO TO CREATE A SPECIAL

03:14:26.721 --> 03:14:28.423
FUND THAT WOULD SMOOTH THE

03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:30.091
IMPACT OF DRUG REBATES.

03:14:30.158 --> 03:14:31.993
ON ON THE MEDI CAL BUDGET THE

03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:32.794
MAYOR VISION CONTINUES THAT AS

03:14:32.861 --> 03:14:35.397
WELL -- AND PROPOSES TO PUT A

03:14:35.463 --> 03:14:36.398
HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:37.999
DOLLARS INTO THAT SPECIAL FUND --

03:14:38.066 --> 03:14:39.601
WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THAT

03:14:39.667 --> 03:14:41.202
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED.

03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:42.270
THOSE PROPOSALS AND KNOW THAT

03:14:42.337 --> 03:14:46.274
THE COMMITTEE TOOK ACTION TO

03:14:46.341 --> 03:14:46.841
APPROVE THE CREATION OF THE

03:14:46.908 --> 03:14:48.243
SPECIAL FUND -- BUT WE FURTHER

03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.877
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:14:48.943 --> 03:14:49.711
DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO SHARE

03:14:49.778 --> 03:14:51.413
KEY INFORMATION WITH THE

03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:52.947
LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD BE GAINED

03:14:53.014 --> 03:14:55.216
FROM -- THESE NEW POSITIONS THAT

03:14:55.283 --> 03:14:56.684
ARE GONNA BE TRACKING -- MEDI

03:14:56.751 --> 03:14:58.086
CAL EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE

03:14:58.153 --> 03:15:00.221
PERHAPS ADDITIONAL MADE YOUR

03:15:00.288 --> 03:15:01.723
UPDATES ON THE CASH FLOWS OF

03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:02.757
CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE

03:15:02.824 --> 03:15:04.459
PROGRAM THAT ARE PARTICULARLY

03:15:04.526 --> 03:15:05.960
SUSCEPTIBLE TO UNCERTAINTY.

03:15:06.027 --> 03:15:07.095
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

03:15:07.162 --> 03:15:08.797
LEGISLATURE HAD DIRECT THE

03:15:08.863 --> 03:15:10.231
DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A LONGER

03:15:10.298 --> 03:15:11.666
TERM PLAN WITH.

03:15:11.733 --> 03:15:13.268
MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT

03:15:13.334 --> 03:15:16.504
WOULD -- IMPROVE THE ESTIMATES

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:17.806
OF THE MEDI CAL BUDGET IN AN

03:15:17.872 --> 03:15:19.407
INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE'S

03:15:19.474 --> 03:15:21.009
ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM.

03:15:21.076 --> 03:15:22.911
AND WOULD SUGGEST THAT PROCESS

03:15:22.977 --> 03:15:25.246
BE CREATED THAT WOULD -- GATHER

03:15:25.313 --> 03:15:27.549
INPUT FROM THE LA -- AND FROM

03:15:27.615 --> 03:15:29.517
OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND TO

03:15:29.584 --> 03:15:31.986
GENERATE IDEAS FOR HOW -- THAT

03:15:32.053 --> 03:15:33.888
PLAN COULD BE ASSEMBLED -- WITH

03:15:33.955 --> 03:15:35.256
WE THINK THIS WOULD HELP THE

03:15:35.323 --> 03:15:37.225
LEGISLATURE -- TO HAVE A LITTLE

03:15:37.292 --> 03:15:38.693
BIT MORE PREDICTABILITY -- IN

03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:40.428
THE FUTURE AS AS SOME OF THESE

03:15:40.495 --> 03:15:44.299
COMPLEXITIES ARE ARE ADDRESSED.

03:15:44.365 --> 03:15:46.534

03:17:53.995 --> 03:17:55.263
THAT THE WHOLE BUDGET BECAUSE WE

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:56.598
HAVE A FEDERAL MATCH AND ENDS

03:17:56.664 --> 03:17:57.565
AND EVERY LIGHTS Là MORE

03:17:57.632 --> 03:18:00.201
COMPLICATED THAN THAT BUT IN

03:18:00.268 --> 03:18:01.536
TERMS OF OUR BUDGET MANAGEMENT.

03:18:01.603 --> 03:18:04.239
HOW MUCH OF A SWING TO HAVE TO

03:18:04.305 --> 03:18:05.273
WORRY ABOUT GENERAL FUND WISE?

03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:06.507
SO THE THREE POINT THREE BILLION

03:18:06.574 --> 03:18:07.508
NUMBER THAT I MENTIONED THAT IS

03:18:07.575 --> 03:18:09.544
GENERAL FUND OKAY AND IT IS IT'S

03:18:09.611 --> 03:18:10.979
ABOUT 14%.

03:18:11.045 --> 03:18:12.614
OF OF THE MASS THAT IS A

03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:14.315
PARTICULARLY LARGE.

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:15.817
ADJUSTMENT AND IMPRACTICAL TERMS

03:18:15.883 --> 03:18:17.385
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LAST

03:18:17.452 --> 03:18:18.786
YEAR AT THIS TIME.

03:18:18.853 --> 03:18:19.787
WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AN

03:18:19.854 --> 03:18:21.189
INCREASE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

03:18:21.256 --> 03:18:22.523
OVER THE PRIOR ESTIMATE AND THAT

03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:24.292
THEN HAD TO FACTOR INTO THE

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.927
LEGISLATURE'S DECISION MAKING

03:18:25.994 --> 03:18:27.295
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT.

03:18:27.362 --> 03:18:28.997
WHAT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO

03:18:29.063 --> 03:18:30.365
ALLOCATE TO VARIOUS PRIORITIES

03:18:30.431 --> 03:18:32.433
YEAH AND THEN IN JANUARY AND

03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:33.868
THEN UPDATING HERE IN MAY IT'S

03:18:33.935 --> 03:18:41.075
NOW SWUNG THE OTHER DIRECTION --

03:18:41.142 --> 03:18:42.277
BY A VERY LARGE AMOUNT.

03:18:42.343 --> 03:18:42.977
AND I'M SURE THE ISSUE BECOMES

03:18:43.044 --> 03:18:44.045
EVEN MORE MAGNIFIED IN YEARS

03:18:44.112 --> 03:18:44.912
WHERE WE HAVE FINANCIAL

03:18:44.979 --> 03:18:46.447
CHALLENGES WERE CASE LET'S GO UP

03:18:46.514 --> 03:18:47.615
AND SO FORTH AS WELL IS THAT

03:18:47.682 --> 03:18:48.449
TRUE.

03:18:48.516 --> 03:18:49.050
THAT THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE A

03:18:49.117 --> 03:18:49.517
TRUE BUT A LOT OF THE

03:18:49.584 --> 03:18:50.551
ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING

03:18:50.618 --> 03:18:52.620
HAVE MORE TO DO WITH -- THE

03:18:52.687 --> 03:18:53.955
TIMING OF PAIN KAY.

03:18:54.022 --> 03:18:55.857
RIGHT OKAY AND THE WAY WE DO THE

03:18:55.923 --> 03:18:57.458
ACCOUNTING FOR THAT RIGHT IS IT

03:18:57.525 --> 03:19:00.695
WE DO CASH RATE SO.

03:19:00.762 --> 03:19:01.763
SO DEL DEPENDS ON WHAT TIME WE

03:19:01.829 --> 03:19:03.031
HAVE TO PAY THE BILL IT'S AT

03:19:03.097 --> 03:19:04.732
DOES A FALL BEFORE OR AFTER.

03:19:04.799 --> 03:19:06.567
OKAY YES AND THE ONLY THING I

03:19:06.634 --> 03:19:07.535
WOULD ADD IS THAT THAT WHAT

03:19:07.602 --> 03:19:08.703
WE'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF

03:19:08.770 --> 03:19:10.605
SAY LIMITING GENERAL FUND GROWTH

03:19:10.672 --> 03:19:12.206
IN THE PROGRAM OVERALL BY ONE

03:19:12.273 --> 03:19:13.841
RELYING A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS

03:19:13.908 --> 03:19:14.876
AND ALSO RELYING ON A LOT OF

03:19:14.942 --> 03:19:16.744
THAT NON GENERAL FUND STATE

03:19:16.811 --> 03:19:17.412
REVENUES.

03:19:17.478 --> 03:19:19.247
THE TOLL THE GENERAL FUND CAN BE

03:19:19.314 --> 03:19:21.215
AT RISK FOR THE CHANGES IN THE

03:19:21.282 --> 03:19:22.784
TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM IN

03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:24.852
WHICH WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR A

03:19:24.919 --> 03:19:26.587
ANY FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S NOT

03:19:26.654 --> 03:19:29.223
COMING IN OR THE TIMING OF THESE.

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:31.693
OTHER NON FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO

03:19:31.759 --> 03:19:33.261
TO SOME DEGREE THE RISK IS

03:19:33.328 --> 03:19:35.229
LARGER THAN JUST THE GENERAL

03:19:35.296 --> 03:19:38.900
FUND PROPORTION OF THE BUDGET

03:19:38.966 --> 03:19:39.834
THAT YOU SEE.

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:41.669
AND SO I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT

03:19:41.736 --> 03:19:42.704
ESPECIALLY THE DRUG REBATE

03:19:42.770 --> 03:19:44.939
BECAUSE OF THAT I REMEMBER ONE

03:19:45.006 --> 03:19:46.074
YEAR WAS A HOSTILE ONE A HALF

03:19:46.140 --> 03:19:47.308
BILLION OR SOMETHING SWINGING

03:19:47.375 --> 03:19:49.444
AND DOES A MISCALCULATION THERE

03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:50.211
IS ANOTHER FEW BILLION LIKE YOU

03:19:50.278 --> 03:19:51.179
KNOW.

03:19:51.245 --> 03:19:52.347
LIKE WHICH THROUGH A FEW BILLION

03:19:52.413 --> 03:19:57.085
HERE FOR THE THEIR RIGHT --

03:19:57.151 --> 03:19:59.287
WHICH IS THE THE SO I APPRECIATE

03:19:59.354 --> 03:20:01.522
YOUR PRESENTATIONS IS THE LA --

03:20:01.589 --> 03:20:02.690
PLAN THE BABY PUT TOGETHER A

03:20:02.757 --> 03:20:03.758
MORE FORMAL REPORT ABOUT THIS

03:20:03.825 --> 03:20:06.260
THAT WE CAN USE AS A TEMPLATE

03:20:06.327 --> 03:20:07.962
FOR PURSUING AND UPS THE WE WILL

03:20:08.029 --> 03:20:09.897
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON

03:20:09.964 --> 03:20:10.098
THIS.

03:20:10.164 --> 03:20:11.833
TO TRY TO HOW HOW IN TERMS OF

03:20:11.899 --> 03:20:13.000
HOW WE BETTER MANAGE OBVIOUSLY

03:20:13.067 --> 03:20:14.235
DOES THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT

03:20:14.302 --> 03:20:15.837
OVERSEES MEDI CAL HOW CAN BETTER

03:20:15.903 --> 03:20:17.772
MONITOR THIS.

03:20:17.839 --> 03:20:20.675
AND AND MANAGE THESE.

03:20:20.742 --> 03:20:22.944
THESE SWINGS IN RISKS.

03:20:23.010 --> 03:20:23.544
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CERTAINLY

03:20:23.611 --> 03:20:24.145
COULD CONSIDER I THINK WE'RE

03:20:24.212 --> 03:20:25.913
VERY INTERESTED IN -- WORKING

03:20:25.980 --> 03:20:27.949
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO OURS

03:20:28.015 --> 03:20:30.318
FIVE WAYS THAT -- WE COULD GET

03:20:30.385 --> 03:20:31.352
THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED AND

03:20:31.419 --> 03:20:32.687
ALSO WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE

03:20:32.754 --> 03:20:33.921
STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE WAY

03:20:33.988 --> 03:20:34.555
THAT WE MAKE OUR PAYMENTS THAT

03:20:34.622 --> 03:20:35.323
COULD.

03:20:35.390 --> 03:20:36.557
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:20:36.624 --> 03:20:40.828
CERTAINTY -- FROM YEAR TO YEAR --

03:20:40.895 --> 03:20:42.497
WE POTENTIALLY COULD PUT THOSE

03:20:42.563 --> 03:20:43.598
THINGS IN HER APARTMENT I THINK.

03:20:43.664 --> 03:20:46.501
WANTED JUST WORK INFORMALLY AND

03:20:46.567 --> 03:20:47.802
WITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON

03:20:47.869 --> 03:20:48.803
THESE ISSUES.

03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:49.871
A CLEAR TO ME AT THAT IS THAT WE

03:20:49.937 --> 03:20:51.005
ALL HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST AND

03:20:51.072 --> 03:20:52.273
SO WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY

03:20:52.340 --> 03:20:53.775
GOALS OF A HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE

03:20:53.841 --> 03:20:55.143
A MUTUAL INTEREST AND FIGURE OUT

03:20:55.209 --> 03:20:57.078
HOW WE BETTER MANAGE THE BUDGET

03:20:57.145 --> 03:21:00.715
AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND

03:21:00.782 --> 03:21:01.849
SWINGS THAT WE HAVE.

03:21:01.916 --> 03:21:03.818
AND IN THE BUDGET.

03:21:03.885 --> 03:21:05.720
YES AND THE THE THE AT THE ONLY

03:21:05.787 --> 03:21:06.854
THING I THAT IS AT THIS REALLY

03:21:06.921 --> 03:21:07.488
CAME TO HAVE THE HEAD A COUPLE

03:21:07.555 --> 03:21:09.157
YEARS AGO WHEN THERE IS A LARGE

03:21:09.223 --> 03:21:10.725
SWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

03:21:10.792 --> 03:21:12.059
AND THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY

03:21:12.126 --> 03:21:14.162
ENGAGED IN PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO

03:21:14.228 --> 03:21:15.863
IMPROVE ITS OWN PROCESS SEES

03:21:15.930 --> 03:21:17.765
SOME OF ITS OWN IT SYSTEMS AND

03:21:17.832 --> 03:21:18.699
SO FORTH.

03:21:18.766 --> 03:21:20.168
AND SO I THINK AT THIS STAGE

03:21:20.234 --> 03:21:22.437
IT'S REALLY TIME -- TO START

03:21:22.503 --> 03:21:23.471
BRINGING THE LEGISLATOR

03:21:23.538 --> 03:21:25.640
LEGISLATURE AS SORT OF OVERSEE

03:21:25.706 --> 03:21:26.974
IS OF THE BUDGET INTO THIS

03:21:27.041 --> 03:21:29.010
PROCESS TO IT TO ENSURE THAT

03:21:29.076 --> 03:21:30.678
THERE'S A GREATER TRANSPARENCY

03:21:30.745 --> 03:21:31.913
IN OVERSIGHT BROADLY.

03:21:31.979 --> 03:21:35.516
WE DON'T JUST OVERSEE THE BUDGET

03:21:35.583 --> 03:21:37.819
WE ACTUALLY WRITE THE BUDGET.

03:21:37.885 --> 03:21:39.086
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE SO

03:21:39.153 --> 03:21:40.788
I THAT SO I THINK -- YEAH SO WE

03:21:40.855 --> 03:21:41.289
WE SHOULD.

03:21:41.355 --> 03:21:42.356
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO

03:21:42.423 --> 03:21:43.624
THROUGH ALL THESE ISSUES HERE

03:21:43.691 --> 03:21:46.260
RIGHT NOW BUT I APPRECIATE THOSE

03:21:46.327 --> 03:21:48.796
PRESENTATIONS AND WE SHOULD BE.

03:21:48.863 --> 03:21:50.865
REALLY LOOKING AT AT SOME

03:21:50.932 --> 03:21:51.599
INITIAL STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN

03:21:51.666 --> 03:21:53.601
AND AND FED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

03:21:53.668 --> 03:21:55.403
THOSE BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S

03:21:55.470 --> 03:21:57.104
SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE

03:21:57.171 --> 03:21:58.739
NOT JUST CONVERSATION BUT THINK

03:21:58.806 --> 03:22:02.143
ABOUT ACTIONS WE WANT TO TAKE --

03:22:02.210 --> 03:22:04.912
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR -- SO A AND

03:22:04.979 --> 03:22:06.681
THAT YOU'D MENTIONED AND AND I

03:22:06.747 --> 03:22:07.748
HAVEN'T SEEN BY UNDERSTAND MY

03:22:07.815 --> 03:22:11.185
STAFF AS THE FINANCIAL REPORT ON

03:22:11.252 --> 03:22:13.287
THE BULK PURCHASING.

03:22:13.354 --> 03:22:17.458
SO THE CARVE OUT SO -- SO WHEN.

03:22:17.525 --> 03:22:20.528
HE SAID THERE'S NO SAVING

03:22:20.595 --> 03:22:21.796
SEVENTY FORTY BE IN THE ACCIDENT

03:22:21.863 --> 03:22:22.563
AND AND AND THE ESTIMATES SO

03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:25.466
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THREE FORTY

03:22:25.533 --> 03:22:25.967
BE THEN.

03:22:26.033 --> 03:22:27.368
RIGHT SO I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S

03:22:27.435 --> 03:22:30.238
NO SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON HOW TO

03:22:30.304 --> 03:22:32.406
RESOLVE THE ISSUE IT NATURALLY

03:22:32.473 --> 03:22:35.142
AS A POLICY -- IF THE CAR ABOUT

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:36.444
HAPPENED AND NOTHING NOTHING

03:22:36.511 --> 03:22:38.079
PROACTIVE WAS DONE BY THE

03:22:38.145 --> 03:22:39.480
LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION

03:22:39.547 --> 03:22:41.682
THERE WOULD THEN BE SAVINGS IN A

03:22:41.749 --> 03:22:43.284
THREE FORTY BE BECAUSE THEY

03:22:43.351 --> 03:22:45.319
WOULD BE BEING PAID AT COST.

03:22:45.386 --> 03:22:46.053
WHICH THEY ARE NOT IN MANAGED

03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:48.789
CARE SO WE WE'RE NOT CHANGING

03:22:48.856 --> 03:22:50.358
THE FEE FOR SERVICE POLICY BUT

03:22:50.424 --> 03:22:51.726
WE DIDN'T WANT SORT OF THE

03:22:51.792 --> 03:22:53.294
CONVERSATION TO GET CONFUSED

03:22:53.361 --> 03:22:54.729
ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE SAVINGS

03:22:54.795 --> 03:22:57.298
WAS FROM THAT VERSES ACTUAL SORT

03:22:57.365 --> 03:22:58.099
OF INCREASES IN REBATES AND

03:22:58.165 --> 03:22:59.333
OTHER.

03:22:59.400 --> 03:23:01.335
OTHER TYPES OF SAVINGS AND SO --

03:23:01.402 --> 03:23:02.436
AS WE SAID BEFORE WE'RE

03:23:02.503 --> 03:23:03.504
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE A

03:23:03.571 --> 03:23:05.606
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT

03:23:05.673 --> 03:23:06.941
ARE THOSE DOLLARS IS ALSO NOT

03:23:07.008 --> 03:23:08.776
POSSIBLE FOR US TO ESTIMATED

03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:09.944
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW

03:23:10.011 --> 03:23:11.746
WHAT THREE FORTY PRICES ARE.

03:23:11.812 --> 03:23:13.481
ONLY THE COVERED ENTITIES DO SO.

03:23:13.548 --> 03:23:14.315
IT FELT.

03:23:14.382 --> 03:23:15.950
FUNNY TO JUST GAS WHAT IT WOULD

03:23:16.017 --> 03:23:17.718
BE AND SAID YOU KNOW I KNOW

03:23:17.785 --> 03:23:19.287
WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR SEASON AT

03:23:19.353 --> 03:23:20.087
COLLEAGUES THAT THEY'VE BEEN

03:23:20.154 --> 03:23:21.389
DOING SOME WORK IN ESTIMATING ON

03:23:21.455 --> 03:23:22.323
WHAT IT WOULD BE.

03:23:22.390 --> 03:23:23.991
AND I THINK AGAIN WE WE WOULD BE

03:23:24.058 --> 03:23:24.592
HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

03:23:24.659 --> 03:23:27.528
ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OPTIONS --

03:23:27.595 --> 03:23:29.030
IF IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE IN

03:23:29.096 --> 03:23:30.831
ADMINISTRATION WANT TO CONTINUE

03:23:30.898 --> 03:23:31.432
HAVE THAT MONEY FLOW TO THEM

03:23:31.499 --> 03:23:33.501
OKAY AND THEN THE THREE HUNDRED

03:23:33.568 --> 03:23:34.335
NINETY THREE MILLION YOU

03:23:34.402 --> 03:23:34.902
MENTIONED SO WHERE IS THAT

03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:36.003
COMING FROM.

03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:38.072
SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONAL

03:23:38.139 --> 03:23:39.807
REBATES AS WELL AS THE

03:23:39.874 --> 03:23:42.577
IMPLEMENTATION OF MAXIMUM

03:23:42.643 --> 03:23:44.412
ALLOWABLE ALLOWABLE INGREDIENT

03:23:44.478 --> 03:23:47.548
COST -- BOTH IN FEE FOR SERVICE

03:23:47.615 --> 03:23:49.517
AND MANAGED CARE -- WE DO I

03:23:49.584 --> 03:23:51.218
THINKS SCOTT PROBABLY DOES HAVE

03:23:51.285 --> 03:23:53.187
THE WORKSHEET THAT LAYS OUT THE

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:58.926
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE OF

03:23:58.993 --> 03:24:00.294
THE FISCAL [inaudible]

THIS BENEFIT.

03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:38.793
IS PROBABLY MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE

03:25:38.859 --> 03:25:40.628
WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT COSTS.

ESPECIALLY WHEN A UP A BUCK

03:26:09.924 --> 03:26:11.525
INVESTED MIGHT SAVE FIVE OR TEN

03:26:11.592 --> 03:26:13.127

GLORIA LET DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

03:26:24.271 --> 03:26:26.307
I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

03:26:26.373 --> 03:26:28.375
WOULD AGREE THAT THERE ARE MANY --

03:26:28.442 --> 03:26:29.910
SERVICES INVESTMENTS THAT COULD

03:26:29.977 --> 03:26:31.812
FURTHER BE MADE IN THE BUDGET

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.614
BUT THERE'RE STILL A LIMITED

03:26:33.681 --> 03:26:35.182
NUMBER OF AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

03:26:35.249 --> 03:26:37.051
AND THEIR MANY INVESTMENTS THAT

03:26:37.118 --> 03:26:38.786
HAVE BEEN MADE THIS IS I'M NOT

03:26:38.853 --> 03:26:43.591
ONE OF THEM BUT WERE HAPPY.

03:26:43.657 --> 03:26:44.258

OKAY -- WELL.

03:26:48.763 --> 03:26:50.030
AND THESE WERE SERVICES THAT

03:26:50.097 --> 03:26:51.565
WERE CUT DURING SOME VERY

03:26:51.632 --> 03:26:53.901
CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES WHEN

03:26:53.968 --> 03:26:56.070
I WAS TAUGHT IN THE LEGISLATURE --

03:26:56.137 --> 03:26:57.905
WE HAD MORE CASH FLOWING INTO

03:26:57.972 --> 03:26:59.440
THE COUNTY TREASURY THAN WE'VE

03:26:59.507 --> 03:27:00.775
EVER WITNESSED IN THE STATE'S

03:27:00.841 --> 03:27:02.042

HISPANICS THAT ARE SEEING

03:27:07.581 --> 03:27:09.316
AMPUTATIONS OTHERWISE COULD HAVE

03:27:09.383 --> 03:27:10.751
BEEN SPARED HAVE THEY HAVE THE

03:27:10.818 --> 03:27:13.754
APPROPRIATE -- PARTY AFTER CAKES

03:27:27.301 --> 03:27:28.335
TO BEGIN TO FUND THIS AGAIN OR

WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU

03:27:30.271 --> 03:27:30.971

OFTEN HEARD THE TERM BUDGET DUST

03:27:47.188 --> 03:27:48.522
THAT'S REALLY BUDGET DUST.

03:27:48.589 --> 03:27:50.057
BUT THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

03:27:50.124 --> 03:27:53.060
COULD MULTIPLY EXPONENTIALLY IF

03:27:53.127 --> 03:27:54.829
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE AMPUTATIONS.

03:27:54.895 --> 03:27:56.664

SPEAK COULD SAVE A HECK OF A LOT

03:28:17.251 --> 03:28:19.019
MORE IN THE FUTURE SO

WHERE THEY WERE INTENDED AND

03:37:28.635 --> 03:37:29.870
ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE GENERAL

03:37:29.936 --> 03:37:31.037
FUND.

03:37:31.104 --> 03:37:33.140
FOR NON MEDICARE ALL NON HEALTH

03:37:33.206 --> 03:37:34.741
CARE RELATED ISSUES.

03:37:34.808 --> 03:37:35.675
SO.

03:37:35.742 --> 03:37:37.244
JUST BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

03:37:37.310 --> 03:37:38.745
THE SUNSET RAISES A LOT OF

03:37:38.812 --> 03:37:42.783
SUSPICIONS -- AS TO WHY WE WOULD

03:37:42.849 --> 03:37:44.317
EVEN CONSIDER.

03:37:44.384 --> 03:37:45.519
THE NEWS FUND SOMEPLACE ELSE

03:37:45.585 --> 03:37:46.720
WHETHER BE THE GENERAL FUND OR

03:37:46.787 --> 03:37:47.854
ELSEWHERE.

03:37:47.921 --> 03:37:49.222
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOVERNOR

03:37:49.289 --> 03:37:51.024
MADE A COMMITMENT.

03:37:51.091 --> 03:37:53.160
A PUBLIC COMMITMENT -- AND THAT

03:37:53.226 --> 03:37:55.195
HE RECEIVED A LOT OF PRAISE.

03:37:55.262 --> 03:37:56.630
FOR THAT A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN

03:37:56.696 --> 03:37:58.131
SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED FOR SO

03:37:58.198 --> 03:37:59.299
MANY YEARS WAS FINANCING SOME

03:37:59.366 --> 03:38:00.934
RELIEF.

03:38:01.001 --> 03:38:02.836
SO WHILE I APPRECIATE YOUR

03:38:02.903 --> 03:38:06.706
COMMENTS -- I'M I'M AS ONE AND I

03:38:06.773 --> 03:38:08.208
THINK MY CAUCUS AS ANOTHER IS

03:38:08.275 --> 03:38:09.843
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS VERY

03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:10.410
CAREFULLY AS WE LOOK AT THE

03:38:10.477 --> 03:38:11.511
BUDGET.

03:38:11.578 --> 03:38:13.680
DOCUMENT AS A WHOLE.

03:38:13.747 --> 03:38:14.915
AND I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW

03:38:14.981 --> 03:38:17.083
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THAT THE

03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:19.252
GOVERNOR MAINTAIN HIS WORD AND

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:20.554
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WE CAN.

03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:22.055
WITH -- THE TAXES OF PEOPLE

03:38:22.122 --> 03:38:24.357
RELIED UPON TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:38:24.424 --> 03:38:26.693
MEDICAL SYSTEM IS IS IS WELL

03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:27.861
FUNDED AS WE POSSIBLY CAN MAKE.

03:38:27.928 --> 03:38:31.097
THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:38:31.164 --> 03:38:33.300
OTHER COMMENTS.

03:38:33.366 --> 03:38:36.069
SO YEAH I I'LL I WOULD -- ALSO

03:38:36.136 --> 03:38:38.371
JUST HAVE SAID REGARDING THE

03:38:38.438 --> 03:38:41.942
SUNSET -- THE VOTERS SO ASIDE

03:38:42.008 --> 03:38:43.477
FROM THE GENERAL MARKET MADE

03:38:43.543 --> 03:38:45.946
ABOUT SUNSETS ON PREVIOUS ITEMS

03:38:46.012 --> 03:38:47.814
I ALSO MENTIONED THAT.

03:38:47.881 --> 03:38:49.382
FOR IT'S A GOOD FOR PROP FIFTY

03:38:49.449 --> 03:38:52.018
SIX THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THIS.

03:38:52.085 --> 03:38:55.121
TAX IS REVENUE STREAM RIGHT.

03:38:55.188 --> 03:38:59.159
AND WITH THAT AND IN GETTING THE

03:38:59.226 --> 03:39:01.928
VOTERS THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THIS

03:39:01.995 --> 03:39:05.565
TO GO TO SPECIFICALLY --

03:39:05.632 --> 03:39:07.567
IMPROVING ACCESS TO MEDICAL

03:39:07.634 --> 03:39:11.438
INCLUDES -- INCLUDING IMPROVING --

03:39:11.505 --> 03:39:13.607
PAYMENTS BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT

03:39:13.673 --> 03:39:14.774
WAS A IT DOESN'T ISSUES I MEAN

03:39:14.841 --> 03:39:15.375
THAT DOUBLE THE CENTER I WAS

03:39:15.442 --> 03:39:17.878
PART OF THAT CAMPAIGN IS THE

03:39:17.944 --> 03:39:18.912
CENTERPIECE OF THE CAMPAIGN.

03:39:18.979 --> 03:39:20.046
AND SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:21.982
WOULD PUT A SUNSET I MEAN THE

03:39:22.048 --> 03:39:23.183
VOTERS ENOUGH VOTE FOR A SUNSET

03:39:23.250 --> 03:39:26.520
ON THE THE PROPOSITION.

03:39:26.586 --> 03:39:28.855
THE IT'S AN ONGOING PROPOSITION

03:39:28.922 --> 03:39:31.892
AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- TO HONOR

03:39:31.958 --> 03:39:33.894
WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED -- FOR THE

03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:35.896
IDEA THAT WE WOULD THEN PUT A

03:39:35.962 --> 03:39:39.065
SUNSET ON ON THOSE THINGS THANK

03:39:39.132 --> 03:39:41.034
IS IS EXTREMELY DISTURBING -- WE

03:39:41.101 --> 03:39:42.469
HAD THIS DISCUSSION WHEN IT

03:39:42.536 --> 03:39:44.504
FIRST PASSED AND PROPOSALS ABOUT

03:39:44.571 --> 03:39:47.207
HOW TO DIRECT THE MONEY -- I

03:39:47.274 --> 03:39:48.608
APPRECIATE THAT THIS GOVERNOR

03:39:48.675 --> 03:39:50.210
HAS MADE STATEMENTS THAT HE

03:39:50.277 --> 03:39:51.578
WANTS HONOR WHAT THE VOTERS

03:39:51.645 --> 03:39:54.548
VOTED FOR FOR PROP -- FIFTY SIX

03:39:54.614 --> 03:39:56.616
AND IT'S IN THEM WE APPRECIATE

03:39:56.683 --> 03:39:57.284
HIS.

03:39:57.350 --> 03:40:00.453
HIS EXPRESSIONS OF THAT AND I I

03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:01.721
THINK THAT AND SO PUTTING A

03:40:01.788 --> 03:40:03.790
SUNSET BASICALLY IMPLYING THAT

03:40:03.857 --> 03:40:05.692
AT THAT SUNSET DATE IS THE THE

03:40:05.759 --> 03:40:06.993
MONEY WOULD THEN REFER TO THE

03:40:07.060 --> 03:40:08.161
GENERAL FUND.

03:40:08.228 --> 03:40:09.529
AGAIN UNDERMINES THE TRUST OF

03:40:09.596 --> 03:40:13.333
THE VOTERS -- AND SO OF THOSE WE

03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.235
GO TRY IT YOU'LL BUILD TRUST

03:40:15.302 --> 03:40:19.139
WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT DO WE KEEP

03:40:19.205 --> 03:40:20.440
OUR PROMISES.

03:40:20.507 --> 03:40:21.207
WHEN VOTERS VOTE FOR THINGS DO

03:40:21.274 --> 03:40:21.808
WE CARRY OUT WHAT THEY DECIDE

03:40:21.875 --> 03:40:24.044
WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE I MEAN

03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.277
WE CAN?

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:26.046
PUT UP MIL WE CAN TRY TO BE

03:40:26.112 --> 03:40:27.747
LEGALISTIC BUT DURING THE

03:40:27.814 --> 03:40:29.349
TENSIONS ARE PROVIDE CLEAR.

03:40:29.416 --> 03:40:31.184
AND SO I THINK THIS REALLY SENDS

03:40:31.251 --> 03:40:32.752
THE WRONG SIGNAL TO THE VOTERS

03:40:32.819 --> 03:40:35.455
ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE TRUSTWORTHY --

03:40:35.522 --> 03:40:38.224
AT THAT WE RESPECT WHAT THEY'VE

03:40:38.291 --> 03:40:40.694
TOLD US -- AND THEN IN ADDITION

03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:42.462
TO THAT OF COURSE IT ALSO HAS

03:40:42.529 --> 03:40:44.197
POLICY IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE

03:40:44.264 --> 03:40:45.365
AGAIN THAT.

03:40:45.432 --> 03:40:47.167
THIS IS A BIT OF REPETITION THE

03:40:47.233 --> 03:40:47.934
PREVIOUS.

03:40:48.001 --> 03:40:49.903
ONES BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

03:40:49.970 --> 03:40:51.237
YOU'RE TELLING OTHER PEOPLE.

03:40:51.304 --> 03:40:52.505
YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DON'T HIRE

03:40:52.572 --> 03:40:54.507
PEOPLE WITH THE INTENTION OF

03:40:54.574 --> 03:40:56.710
LAYING THE MáS IN TWO YEARS.

03:40:56.776 --> 03:40:59.179
RIGHT HI YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE

03:40:59.245 --> 03:41:00.680
THAT WELL WILL -- WE'RE GONNA

03:41:00.747 --> 03:41:02.382
BRING YOU ON BOARD BUT THEN WE

03:41:02.449 --> 03:41:03.984
WON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO I MEAN

03:41:04.050 --> 03:41:05.518
THAT THAT'S RIGHT OR WE'RE GOING

03:41:05.585 --> 03:41:07.354
TO CUT YOUR SALARY IN TWO YEARS

03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:08.288
I GUESS YOU COULD BECAUSE HE

03:41:08.355 --> 03:41:09.389
REALLY UP FRONT ABOUT IT BUT

03:41:09.456 --> 03:41:10.357
THEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HOW

03:41:10.423 --> 03:41:11.591
HARD IS IT TO RECRUIT.

03:41:11.658 --> 03:41:13.560
PEOPLE FOR THAT.

03:41:13.627 --> 03:41:17.097
SO -- SO I THINK IT HAS A

03:41:17.163 --> 03:41:17.831
CHILLING EFFECT ALSO IN THAT

03:41:17.897 --> 03:41:19.432
REGARD BUT IT FUNDAMENTALLY.

03:41:19.499 --> 03:41:22.002
THE IDEA THAT THE VOTERS SAID WE

03:41:22.068 --> 03:41:23.603
ARE PASSING THIS PROPOSITION FOR

03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:25.672
THIS PURPOSE AND THEN WE HEAR

03:41:25.739 --> 03:41:28.875
AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT WE ARE

03:41:28.942 --> 03:41:30.510
GOING TO PROPOSE TO SAY WELL.

03:41:30.577 --> 03:41:32.479
TOO BAD WE'RE GOING TO GO AND

03:41:32.545 --> 03:41:34.681
JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND THEN FOR

03:41:34.748 --> 03:41:38.118
SOMETHING ELSE OR JUST THROWN TO

03:41:38.184 --> 03:41:39.352
THE GENERAL POT.

03:41:39.419 --> 03:41:40.153
I THINK RELIEF SENDS THE WRONG

03:41:40.220 --> 03:41:42.322
MESSAGE AND IT AND AS WE HAVE TO

03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:43.757
GO BACK TO THE VOTERS TO TALK

03:41:43.823 --> 03:41:45.392
ABOUT OTHER PRIORITIES AND WE

03:41:45.458 --> 03:41:46.292
HAVE O PROVE OURSELVES

03:41:46.359 --> 03:41:48.428
TRUSTWORTHY OF THAT AND AS A

03:41:48.495 --> 03:41:49.462
EVERY TIME SO I THINK IT'S

03:41:49.529 --> 03:41:51.097
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T.

03:41:51.164 --> 03:41:53.033
IMPLY IN ANY WAY THAT WE ARE NOT

03:41:53.099 --> 03:41:55.669
FIND INTENTIONS OF THE VOTERS.

03:41:55.735 --> 03:41:56.770
THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WENT

03:41:56.836 --> 03:41:58.938
AND CAMPAIGN FOR THE PROPOSITION

03:41:59.005 --> 03:42:00.140
SUCCESSFULLY.

03:42:00.206 --> 03:42:01.207
AND AND AND SAID THAT THIS IS

03:42:01.274 --> 03:42:02.342
THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSITION

03:42:02.409 --> 03:42:04.377
WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT AND I

03:42:04.444 --> 03:42:06.646
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT --

03:42:06.713 --> 03:42:10.083
THAT -- WE NOT SEND THAT WE NOT

03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:11.685
TELL THE VOTERS OTHERWISE SO.

03:42:11.751 --> 03:42:13.620
SO TO ME THAT AGAIN THE SUNSET

03:42:13.687 --> 03:42:14.788
SUNSET THE SUN SETS IN GENERAL

03:42:14.854 --> 03:42:17.891
THE PROBLEM THIS ONE IN

03:42:17.957 --> 03:42:18.425
PARTICULAR IS PARTICULARLY

03:42:18.491 --> 03:42:20.727
PROBLEMATIC -- THE OTHER ISSUE I

03:42:20.794 --> 03:42:22.962
ACTUALLY WANT TO ASK ABOUT SO I

03:42:23.029 --> 03:42:25.365
DO APPRECIATE THE THE PROPOSALS --

03:42:25.432 --> 03:42:27.400
IN TERMS OF THE AUGMENTATIONS --

03:42:27.467 --> 03:42:29.102
THE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THE

03:42:29.169 --> 03:42:30.203
OPTICAL WAS SOMETHING THAT THIS

03:42:30.270 --> 03:42:33.540
LEGISLATURE PASSED BEFORE SO I

03:42:33.606 --> 03:42:35.542
REALLY DO IT -- THAT WAS

03:42:35.608 --> 03:42:37.544
SUPPOSED TO BE WE'RE DOING THIS

03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:39.145
PREVIOUSLY I WOULD.

03:42:39.212 --> 03:42:42.816
COMMENT THAT -- ALSO -- EIGHT MY

03:42:42.882 --> 03:42:43.883
MY GOOD FRIEND HAS TALKED ABOUT

03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:47.487
THE DIET TREE IS WELL AND NOT TO

03:42:47.554 --> 03:42:48.988
THE SAFE IT'S AN FIFTY SIX BUT

03:42:49.055 --> 03:42:50.090
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE

03:42:50.156 --> 03:42:53.893
END COST BENEFIT RATIO RIGHT --

03:42:53.960 --> 03:42:55.462
THE BUT THERE'S FINANCIAL ARE

03:42:55.528 --> 03:42:57.397
ALSO IN THE BUT THE OTHER FOR

03:42:57.464 --> 03:42:59.799
AND AND THE OTHER PIECE I ALSO

03:42:59.866 --> 03:43:01.668
WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THE I

03:43:01.735 --> 03:43:04.370
BELIEVE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED --

03:43:04.437 --> 03:43:04.771
WITH.

03:43:04.838 --> 03:43:06.506
THE X. YES WAS STILL WORKING ON

03:43:06.573 --> 03:43:11.544

AND WHERE AND I THINK WE EXPRESS

03:43:14.080 --> 03:43:15.248
THAT AT LEAST WHAT WAS BEING

03:43:15.315 --> 03:43:16.850
PROPOSED AND EVEN YOU AND THE

03:43:16.916 --> 03:43:18.818
DIRECTOR AT SAID THAT'S NOT WHAT

THOUGH I FULLY OWNED THAT THAT

03:43:28.561 --> 03:43:30.196

GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

03:43:53.586 --> 03:43:57.924
DATE IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT

03:43:57.991 --> 03:43:58.491
I'M I'M PRETTY CLOSE AT THIS

03:43:58.558 --> 03:43:59.459
POINT.

BASICALLY WE WANNA BE SURE THE

03:44:05.932 --> 03:44:07.967
MONEY IS FOCUSED IN A WAY THAT

03:44:08.034 --> 03:44:10.069
NEWS THE NEEDLE ON ACCESS TO

03:44:10.136 --> 03:44:10.804
FAMILY PLANNING THAT'S WHAT I

BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THAT'S

03:51:32.712 --> 03:51:34.714

YEAR TO YEAR BUT IS THIS IS WHAT

03:52:15.521 --> 03:52:16.622
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE REASON FOR

03:52:16.689 --> 03:52:19.058
THE OPPOSITION.

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:24.563
TO DOING A LONGER PLAN AMENDMENT.

03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:25.331
I JUST THINK IT'S DEPARTMENT OF

03:52:25.398 --> 03:52:27.133

03:52:27.199 --> 03:52:28.901
EARLIER IT DOES -- ONE YEAR

03:52:28.968 --> 03:52:30.169
STATE PLAN AMENDMENT DOES GIVE

03:52:30.236 --> 03:52:31.570
THE DEPARTMENT A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:52:31.637 --> 03:52:33.639
OF FLEXIBILITY -- AN INMATE

03:52:33.706 --> 03:52:34.874
ADMINISTRATION GENERAL ARE

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.742
FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY TO DO

03:52:36.809 --> 03:52:39.045
WHAT TO ELIMINATE THE PAYMENTS

03:52:39.111 --> 03:52:40.146

03:52:40.212 --> 03:52:41.747
WOULD HAVE LIKE CIVILIAN A CD NO

03:52:41.814 --> 03:52:43.249
NO CERTAINLY AND I'M NOT THAT

03:52:43.316 --> 03:52:45.017
KIND OF FLEXIBILITY IT IS A

03:52:45.084 --> 03:52:47.019
DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE --

03:52:47.086 --> 03:52:48.688
BEING A TOBACCO TAX ALL TOBACCO

03:52:48.754 --> 03:52:50.656
TAXES SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

03:52:50.723 --> 03:52:52.425
ADMINISTRATION HAS FLEXIBILITY

03:52:52.491 --> 03:52:54.093
TO REEVALUATE FUNDING LEVELS ON

03:52:54.160 --> 03:52:55.361
A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS.

03:52:55.428 --> 03:52:58.631
AN ANNUAL STATE PLAN AMENDMENT

03:52:58.698 --> 03:53:00.499
DOES A FACILITY THAT PROCESS.

03:53:00.566 --> 03:53:01.367
SO I GUESS.

03:53:01.434 --> 03:53:03.035
VAN THAT MAKES EVEN MORE

03:53:03.102 --> 03:53:06.138
IMPORTANT -- THAT THE

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:07.440
ADMINISTRATION SENDS A CLEAR

03:53:07.506 --> 03:53:09.475
SIGNAL AGAIN THE THE SUNSET THE

03:53:09.542 --> 03:53:10.943
FORTIES THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT

03:53:11.010 --> 03:53:11.977
THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO THIS

03:53:12.044 --> 03:53:14.246
DOING THIS AN ON GOING BASIS.

03:53:14.313 --> 03:53:15.281
RIGHT I MEAN CLEARLY YOU KNOW

YEAR WE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:19.251
AND SO FORTH BUT THAT THE

03:53:19.318 --> 03:53:21.320
INTENTION AND COMMITMENT IS THAT

03:53:21.387 --> 03:53:22.088
THIS IS GOING TO BE SUSTAINED

03:53:22.154 --> 03:53:24.156
EFFORT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE GET

03:53:24.223 --> 03:53:26.125

OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.

03:53:30.963 --> 03:53:32.531
SO SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:53:32.598 --> 03:53:34.200
IMPORTANT THAT THAT.

03:53:34.266 --> 03:53:35.634

DECREASE OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC

03:56:50.029 --> 03:56:51.163
HEALTH ACTIVITIES.

03:56:51.230 --> 03:56:52.464
THE MAYOR VISION NO LONGER

03:56:52.531 --> 03:56:53.933
REFLECTS TO CHANGE THE

03:56:53.999 --> 03:56:56.468
REDIRECTION AMOUNT OF THE FOR

03:56:56.535 --> 03:56:58.070
COUNTIES REALIGNMENT REVENUES

03:56:58.137 --> 03:56:59.038
275%.

03:56:59.104 --> 03:57:00.839
SECOND THE MAYBE REVISION

03:57:00.906 --> 03:57:02.508
REFLECTS YOLO COUNTY AT THE

03:57:02.575 --> 03:57:04.209
COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM

03:57:04.276 --> 03:57:05.077
COUNTY.

03:57:05.144 --> 03:57:07.012
AND LASTLY THE MAY REVISION

03:57:07.079 --> 03:57:09.148

SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD.

03:57:12.585 --> 03:57:14.420
UNTIL THE BOARD'S TOTAL RESERVES

03:57:14.486 --> 03:57:17.890
REACHED A REASONABLE LEVEL EQUAL

03:57:17.957 --> 03:57:18.357
TO TWO YEARS OF TOTAL

03:57:18.424 --> 03:57:19.892
EXPENDITURES.

03:57:19.959 --> 03:57:21.327
AT THAT POINT THE WARTS

03:57:21.393 --> 03:57:23.829
REDIRECTION WILL BE REFLECTED AT

03:57:23.896 --> 03:57:24.797
75%.

03:57:24.863 --> 03:57:27.566
AND WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS ON

THE REDIRECTION LEVEL AT 75% FOR

03:57:30.636 --> 03:57:32.504
THE SEEM AS KEYBOARD FROM FROM

03:57:32.571 --> 03:57:34.073
THE LA -- INSTEAD HOLDERS AND

03:57:34.139 --> 03:57:35.307
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE WILL

03:57:35.374 --> 03:57:39.278
BE TAKING THESE CONCERNS BACK

03:57:39.345 --> 03:57:40.613
FOR CONSIDERATION [inaudible]

03:57:40.679 --> 03:57:42.448
OKAY AVAIL.

03:57:42.514 --> 03:57:45.084
ON THE NUMBER OF VICE ESTIMATES

03:57:45.150 --> 03:57:47.453
FOR THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE AL --

03:57:47.519 --> 03:57:48.988
WE THINK A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY

03:57:49.054 --> 03:57:50.589
TIMELINE IS VERY REASONABLE IN

03:57:50.656 --> 03:57:51.824
LIGHT OF THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE

03:57:51.890 --> 03:57:53.392
WITH THE PREVIOUS EXPANSION TO

03:57:53.459 --> 03:57:55.494
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN -- WE'RE

03:57:55.561 --> 03:57:56.528
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

03:57:56.595 --> 03:57:58.030
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND --

03:57:58.097 --> 03:57:59.932
REVISED CASELOAD ESTIMATES BUT

03:57:59.999 --> 03:58:00.566
DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS

03:58:00.633 --> 03:58:01.800
TIME.

03:58:01.867 --> 03:58:03.936
ON THE AB EIGHTY FIVE ISSUE --

03:58:04.003 --> 03:58:05.037
WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE

03:58:05.104 --> 03:58:08.040
MAY STILL BE SOME SAVINGS IN THE

03:58:08.107 --> 03:58:09.675
FOR A NON CMS P. COUNTIES THAT

03:58:09.742 --> 03:58:10.843
WERE MENTIONED.

03:58:10.909 --> 03:58:11.677
AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

03:58:11.744 --> 03:58:12.811
ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS A POLICY

03:58:12.878 --> 03:58:14.413
CHOICE TO ALLOW THOSE SAVINGS TO

03:58:14.480 --> 03:58:15.714
STAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR

03:58:15.781 --> 03:58:16.882
LOCAL PRIORITIES INCLUDING

03:58:16.949 --> 03:58:18.384
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES.

03:58:18.450 --> 03:58:19.952
THAT'S A REASONABLE PRIORITY --

03:58:20.019 --> 03:58:21.487
BUT ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE OF

03:58:21.553 --> 03:58:22.721
COURSE CAN CAN WEIGH AGAINST

03:58:22.788 --> 03:58:24.757
OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR

03:58:24.823 --> 03:58:27.126
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES -- WE

03:58:27.192 --> 03:58:28.794
ALSO THINK IT IS REASONABLE I'M

03:58:28.861 --> 03:58:30.663
AS WE NOTED BEFORE FOR THE STATE

03:58:30.729 --> 03:58:31.964
TO RE DIRECT.

03:58:32.031 --> 03:58:33.866
REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM THE C.

03:58:33.932 --> 03:58:35.134
M. S. P. PROGRAM GIVEN THAT THEY

03:58:35.200 --> 03:58:37.569
HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT RESERVE --

03:58:37.636 --> 03:58:39.138
OVER TEN YEARS OF OPERATING

03:58:39.204 --> 03:58:43.575
EXPENSES -- BUT AS WAS NOTED --

03:58:43.642 --> 03:58:45.978
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

03:58:46.045 --> 03:58:48.180
THAT IT APPEARS THE IT'S OUR

03:58:48.247 --> 03:58:48.981
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MISTER

03:58:49.048 --> 03:58:50.249
SINCE PROPOSAL WOULD

03:58:50.315 --> 03:58:52.584
ADDITIONALLY -- ELIMINATE GROWTH

03:58:52.651 --> 03:58:53.686
FUNDING TO THE SAME AS P.

03:58:53.752 --> 03:58:55.087
PROGRAM.

03:58:55.154 --> 03:58:59.124
INDEFINITELY -- AND AT 75% --

03:58:59.191 --> 03:59:02.628
WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SEEM AS

03:59:02.695 --> 03:59:03.595
P. PROGRAM NOT RECEIVING.

03:59:03.662 --> 03:59:06.131
REVENUES EVEN AFTER ITS RESERVES

03:59:06.198 --> 03:59:07.599
GO DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL.

03:59:07.666 --> 03:59:09.301
NOW OF COURSE GIVEN THE

03:59:09.368 --> 03:59:10.502
MAGNITUDE OF RESERVES OF THE

03:59:10.569 --> 03:59:11.737
PROGRAM HAS THIS WOULD ALL TAKE

03:59:11.804 --> 03:59:12.971
PLACE.

03:59:13.038 --> 03:59:15.107
YEARS IN THE FUTURE -- BUT WE

03:59:15.174 --> 03:59:16.308
WOULD KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT

03:59:16.375 --> 03:59:17.843
NECESSARILY A NEED FOR THE

03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:19.378
LEGISLATURE TO DEFINE.

03:59:19.445 --> 03:59:20.746
THE PARAMETERS OF ONGOING

03:59:20.813 --> 03:59:21.847
FUNDING FOR THE SAME IS BE

03:59:21.914 --> 03:59:23.015
PROGRAM.

03:59:23.082 --> 03:59:24.983
AT THIS POINT -- INSTEAD THE

03:59:25.050 --> 03:59:26.452
LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT.

03:59:26.518 --> 03:59:28.721
THAT THE REVENUES BE REDIRECTED

03:59:28.787 --> 03:59:30.589
AND FURTHER DIRECT THAT THE

03:59:30.656 --> 03:59:34.393

THAT THEIR CASE LET'S HAVE

03:59:42.901 --> 03:59:45.370
FALLEN SO SIGNIFICANTLY WITH

03:59:45.437 --> 03:59:49.341

THEIR SHARE OF COST IS REALLY

04:11:35.613 --> 04:11:37.015
HIGH THEY MIGHT NOT GO GET THOSE

ALSO LOOKING SEE WHAT I CAN DO A

04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:06.578
LITTLE MORE -- I REALLY

04:12:06.644 --> 04:12:08.947

04:12:14.986 --> 04:12:16.788
APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL.

04:12:16.855 --> 04:12:23.695
REGARDING CMS P. AND THE SO -- I

04:12:23.761 --> 04:12:27.065
YET I GET THE IDEA THAT OKAY.

04:12:27.131 --> 04:12:29.834
AND FROM THE C. M. S. V. FOLKS

04:12:29.901 --> 04:12:30.902
THAT WHILE THEY GOT FIRST OF ALL

04:12:30.969 --> 04:12:32.570
WE GOT ONE KIND OF LARGEST CHUNK

04:12:32.637 --> 04:12:34.739
OF MONEY BACK FOR THE ACA BUT

04:12:34.806 --> 04:12:36.708
THEY'RE SITTING ON TEN YEARS.

04:12:36.774 --> 04:12:37.375
RIGHT THAT'S WHY [inaudible]

04:12:37.442 --> 04:12:43.481
OKAY -- THE OPERATING RESERVE OF

04:12:43.548 --> 04:12:44.349
NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

04:12:44.415 --> 04:12:45.550
DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THEIR

04:12:45.617 --> 04:12:47.418
EXPENDITURES A. COULD BE MORE

04:12:47.485 --> 04:12:48.753
THAN TEN YEARS OKAY.

04:12:48.820 --> 04:12:51.055
ALL RIGHT SO.

04:12:51.122 --> 04:12:52.724
SO I GET THE IDEA YOU'RE SAYING

04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:53.825
OKAY WELL.

04:12:53.892 --> 04:12:55.059
AT AND MOST OF THE MONEY COMES

04:12:55.126 --> 04:12:55.960
FROM WHERE [inaudible]

04:12:56.027 --> 04:12:59.063
FROM.

04:12:59.130 --> 04:13:01.199
FROM -- THE REALIGNMENT RAVENOUS

04:13:01.266 --> 04:13:03.301
RIGHT NOW OKAY SO SO THAT SO

04:13:03.368 --> 04:13:05.103
THAT THAT IS SO AND SO ONE OF

04:13:05.169 --> 04:13:06.371
THINGS I HEAR THEM SAYING THAT

04:13:06.437 --> 04:13:08.306
DATED SO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:13:08.373 --> 04:13:09.307
SPENDING OUT SOME POINT WE'VE.

04:13:09.374 --> 04:13:12.076
THE MONEY NEEDS THAT.

04:13:12.143 --> 04:13:13.211
THE ARTS WE KEEP IT SAID I HEARD

04:13:13.278 --> 04:13:17.448
SPEND DOWN THE TWO YEARS ROUGHLY.

04:13:17.515 --> 04:13:19.350
AND DESERVE PLAN THEN FOR THEM.

04:13:19.417 --> 04:13:20.985
TO TO THEN GET REVENUE AGAIN FOR

04:13:21.052 --> 04:13:22.887
THAT OR I MEAN I GUESS THAT

04:13:22.954 --> 04:13:24.222
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S COME UP

04:13:24.289 --> 04:13:26.457
SO BECAUSE OTHERWISE EFFECTIVELY

04:13:26.524 --> 04:13:27.892
YOU'RE NOT SAYING SPEND UNTIL

04:13:27.959 --> 04:13:29.994
TWO YEARS I MEAN IT JUST GOES

04:13:30.061 --> 04:13:31.496
DOWN TO ZERO CORRECT.

04:13:31.563 --> 04:13:34.165
SO -- AND I REALIZE THAT'S NOT

04:13:34.232 --> 04:13:35.400
THIS YEAR -- PRIVACY SEVERAL

04:13:35.466 --> 04:13:37.201
YEARS OUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE

04:13:37.268 --> 04:13:41.506
THE THE THE AMOUNTS BUT IS.

04:13:41.573 --> 04:13:43.441
CAN CAN.

04:13:43.508 --> 04:13:44.475
AT ONE ALABAMA TO GUESS WHAT IT

04:13:44.542 --> 04:13:45.610
APARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO --

04:13:45.677 --> 04:13:46.911
THE TERRIBLE IS FORTHCOMING ON

04:13:46.978 --> 04:13:48.947
THIS -- AND SO THE PROPOSAL

04:13:49.013 --> 04:13:51.149
RIGHT NOW IS AFTER WE DETERMINED

04:13:51.215 --> 04:13:52.283
THAT THERE'S A YOU KNOW A

04:13:52.350 --> 04:13:54.652
REASONABLE RESERVE -- WE WILL

04:13:54.719 --> 04:13:56.588
RIVER OR THE REDIRECTION AMOUNT

04:13:56.654 --> 04:13:59.290
WILL CHANGE 275% AND SO THAT'S

04:13:59.357 --> 04:14:00.558
THE POINT THAT THE ALLEY --

04:14:00.625 --> 04:14:03.728
RAISED EARLIER THAT -- PERHAPS

04:14:03.795 --> 04:14:07.365
SAID 75% -- THEN THE THE REVENUE --

04:14:07.432 --> 04:14:08.933
MAY STILL.

04:14:09.000 --> 04:14:11.369
MAY STILL BE ZERO AND SO THAT'S

04:14:11.436 --> 04:14:12.236
WITH MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED

04:14:12.303 --> 04:14:13.538
EARLIER THOSE ARE THE COMMENTS

04:14:13.605 --> 04:14:14.272
THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE BACK IN

04:14:14.339 --> 04:14:17.141
TERMS OF THE 75% VERSUS MAYBE

04:14:17.208 --> 04:14:19.377
PERHAPS ANOTHER LEVEL -- BUT THE

04:14:19.444 --> 04:14:21.713
PROPOSAL AS IT IS TODAY IS -- TO

04:14:21.779 --> 04:14:25.650
AFTER REASONABLE RESERVE.

04:14:25.717 --> 04:14:26.918
IS REACHED THEN WE WOULD --

04:14:26.985 --> 04:14:29.253
INCREASE EVERY DIRECTION 275% OF

04:14:29.320 --> 04:14:30.955
THE VOTE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIT

04:14:31.022 --> 04:14:33.257
SO THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT

04:14:33.324 --> 04:14:35.493
JUST MENTION IS THAT -- IN A FEW

04:14:35.560 --> 04:14:36.861
CAN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S

04:14:36.928 --> 04:14:39.197
LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO GET

04:14:39.263 --> 04:14:41.232
MORE UNDOCUMENTED COVERED AND I

04:14:41.299 --> 04:14:42.233
THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT WE

04:14:42.300 --> 04:14:43.935
CAN DO EVEN MORE OVER THE YEARS

04:14:44.002 --> 04:14:47.105
MAYBE WE'RE SO LUCKY WILL EVEN.

04:14:47.171 --> 04:14:48.840
GET EVERYBODY BEFORE THE THAT

04:14:48.906 --> 04:14:50.608
RUNS OUT AND AND RECOGNIZE THAT

04:14:50.675 --> 04:14:51.809
NOT EVERYONE ON C. MYSTERIES

04:14:51.876 --> 04:14:53.177
NECESSARILY AND DOCUMENT EITHER

04:14:53.244 --> 04:14:55.680
SO THE PROGRAMS NOT JUST SERVING

04:14:55.747 --> 04:14:58.850
A DOCUMENT CORRECT.

04:14:58.916 --> 04:15:00.818
THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS --

04:15:00.885 --> 04:15:02.420
UNDOCUMENTED AND FOLKS THAT JUST

04:15:02.487 --> 04:15:03.888
DON'T HAVE OTHER COVERAGE RIGHT

04:15:03.955 --> 04:15:04.922
OKAY SO I MEAN WE'VE DONE

04:15:04.989 --> 04:15:07.191
COVERAGE EXPANSIONS OF OTHER

04:15:07.258 --> 04:15:09.160
TYPES TO SELL.

04:15:09.227 --> 04:15:10.461
SO BUT THE ONE PART I ALSO

04:15:10.528 --> 04:15:11.796
WANTED SO EVEN IF WE OFFER

04:15:11.863 --> 04:15:15.400
COVERAGE TO ALL UNDOCUMENTED.

04:15:15.466 --> 04:15:16.234
THE THING I THINK WE NEED TO

04:15:23.941 --> 04:15:25.009
SOME CHALLENGES WITH SOME

THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NOT

04:37:10.313 --> 04:37:11.414
ACCEPTING THE RESPONSIBILITY

04:37:11.481 --> 04:37:12.716
BECAUSE THEY DELEGATED ALL THAT

04:37:12.782 --> 04:37:15.018
DOWN TO THE OTHER PAIR SO TO THE

04:37:15.085 --> 04:37:16.553
EXTENT THAT THAT'S A PART OF

04:37:16.619 --> 04:37:17.153
THIS WE THINK WOULD BE A GOOD

04:37:17.220 --> 04:37:17.687
THING.

04:37:17.754 --> 04:37:18.822

IN REGARDS TO DELEGATED ENTITIES

04:37:27.230 --> 04:37:29.733
IS THAT PART OF THIS TRAILER

04:37:29.799 --> 04:37:32.002
BILL LANGUAGE IT'S NOT SPECIFIC

04:37:32.068 --> 04:37:34.337
TO THIS -- THIS WOULD COVER SORT

04:37:34.404 --> 04:37:36.473
OF THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT

04:37:36.539 --> 04:37:37.974
I THINK WE ARE WE HAVE YOU KNOW

04:37:38.041 --> 04:37:39.042
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD SOME

04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:40.577
CONCERNING ISSUES SEVENTH POPPED

04:37:40.643 --> 04:37:41.811
UP IN THE RECENT YEARS.

04:37:41.878 --> 04:37:43.079
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AND SO

THAT SO THIS WOULD SUPPORT THAT

04:37:48.151 --> 04:37:51.321
BUT IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY TIED

04:37:51.388 --> 04:37:51.554
TO THAT.

04:37:51.621 --> 04:37:54.924
OKAY SO I THE ESTATE A. THINK

04:37:54.991 --> 04:37:55.892
WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS IS THAT.

04:37:55.959 --> 04:37:57.027
JUST WON'T BE SURE THERE'S

04:37:57.093 --> 04:37:58.228
CLARITY SELF IT'S THEY OBVIOUSLY

04:37:58.294 --> 04:37:59.729

04:37:59.796 --> 04:38:01.264
ENTITIES BUT DO I MAKE SURE THAT

04:38:01.331 --> 04:38:02.265

04:38:03.666 --> 04:38:05.402
TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND

04:38:05.468 --> 04:38:06.536
CLARITY.

04:38:06.603 --> 04:38:08.605
ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO -- TO BE

04:38:08.671 --> 04:38:09.739

04:38:09.806 --> 04:38:12.042
PROCESS THAT THERE'S CLEARLY

04:38:12.108 --> 04:38:13.076
ALSO THEN.

04:38:13.143 --> 04:38:14.310
AGAIN WE ARE NEVER WON WE HOPE

04:38:14.377 --> 04:38:16.112
WE NEVER HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WE

04:38:16.179 --> 04:38:17.881
EVER NEED TO DO THIS -- BUT THAT

04:38:17.947 --> 04:38:19.549
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO

04:38:19.616 --> 04:38:21.918
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AT

04:38:21.985 --> 04:38:25.989
LEAST THE HOURS THESE THE PLAN

04:38:26.056 --> 04:38:26.956
HAS TO HAVE.

04:38:27.023 --> 04:38:28.625
RESPONSIBILITY OVER DELEGATED

04:38:28.691 --> 04:38:30.460
ENERGY BUT THE PRIDE DEL THEY

04:38:30.527 --> 04:38:31.795
AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT THE

04:38:31.861 --> 04:38:33.063
IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT OVER TO

04:38:33.129 --> 04:38:35.999
DELEGATE ANY DISCOUNTS CAN

04:38:36.066 --> 04:38:38.668
SIMPLY SAY NOT OUR PROBLEM.

04:38:38.735 --> 04:38:39.135
OKAY.

04:38:39.202 --> 04:38:40.603
HI THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE

04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:41.204
GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPENED.

04:38:41.271 --> 04:38:42.338
FINALLY WE HAVE -- DON'T USE OF

04:38:42.405 --> 04:38:44.407
MARIJUANA ACT TO USE EDUCATION

04:38:44.474 --> 04:38:44.908
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

04:38:44.974 --> 04:38:47.777
WORKLOAD. TO THE OBVIOUSLY PROP

04:38:47.844 --> 04:38:48.378
SIXTY FOUR WAS PASSED BY THE

04:38:48.445 --> 04:38:50.213
VOTERS AND IT REALLY DIRECTS THE

04:38:50.280 --> 04:38:52.382
DEPARTMENT TO DO A FEW THINGS IN

04:38:52.449 --> 04:38:54.818
TERMS OF THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE

04:38:54.884 --> 04:38:56.586

THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

04:39:00.423 --> 04:39:02.258
SO IN THE MAY REVISION IT DOES

04:39:02.325 --> 04:39:03.693
REFLECT A HUNDRED NINETEEN

04:39:03.760 --> 04:39:05.295

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR

04:39:10.934 --> 04:39:12.902
SURVEILLANCE IN EDUCATION -- THE

04:39:12.969 --> 04:39:14.537
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD BE

04:39:14.604 --> 04:39:16.072
GETTING A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY

04:39:16.139 --> 04:39:17.874
MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND SLOTS
