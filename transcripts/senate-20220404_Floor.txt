ALONG WITH THE DEATH THE PERKINS AND A DEATH SAYS ON T. DRIVE ON BEHALF OF CENTER GROVE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE WE WELCOME YOU TO THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AS WE DO OUR BUSINESS. MEMBERS ARE MOVING UP- WE'RE GOING BACK TO SENATE THIRD READING ITEM NUMBER FORTY WHICH IS SENATOR MAN. HE IS READY PLEASE READ. SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY FIVE BY SENATOR MEN RELATIVE TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM CENTER MEN THE FOR YEARS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY FIVE WHICH- RECOGNIZES THAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS IS CRUCIAL FOR FOSTERING HEALTHY DISCOURSE IN THIS. IN OUR CLASSROOMS I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT. CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR ECONOMY OF OUR SOCIETY- THEY'RE CONSIDERED A TOOL AROUND THE WORLD. AND AT THE HEART OF HIGHER EDUCATION I SPEAK AS A LAW PROFESSOR SOMEONE WHO IS TUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM IS THE IDEA OF ACADEMIC INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM. OUR CLASSROOMS WOULD NOT BE AS ROBUST IF WE DID NOT HAVE THAT TYPE OF DIALOGUE- IT WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLASSROOM WHERE WE CAN HAVE A SETTING. I'M SORRY- WHERE WHERE WE CAN ENCOURAGE CHALLENGING ONE'S ASSUMPTIONS AND BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD- YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT WITHOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE. HI IT'S S. R. FORTY FIVE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING ACADEMIC. FREEDOM FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS INCLUDING IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THIS RESOLUTION IS SPONSORED BY THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE- SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IF I MAY. YOU MAY OR AYE PROCEDURALLY MADAM PRESIDENT. OKAY AT W. TAKE A QUESTION CENTERMAN- YES THEY WILL BE WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH- AS SENATOR MAN WOULD YOU BE WILLING AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO AMEND YOUR BILL ARE TO SUPPORT A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY POLICY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON OUR STUDENTS POLITICAL AFFILIATION SO INCLUDING STUDENTS WITHIN YOUR RESOLUTION AND NOT JUST THE FACULTY. I THINK THIS BILL READY GO OUT I'D BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER A SEPARATE RESOLUTION ABOUT STUDENT VIEWS AS WELL. NO NO THEN. ARE NOT WITHIN YOUR BILL WELL THIS BILL IS A I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO LIKE INCLUDE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT BUT- I'D BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING RESOLUTION IF YOU LIKE TO OFFER ONE. ON STUDENT VISAS. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE GOAL OF THIS PARTICULAR OKAY WELL I AM SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT- BECAUSE I RISE IN A BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE MERITS OF THIS RESOLUTION. AND WHAT IT SAYS TO OUR STUDENTS AND THE PARENTS- WHEN IT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE ALLOWING IN IN OUR UNIVERSITIES WHEN IT COMES TO CONTROVERSY ALL SUBJECT MATTER IN OUR SCHOOLS AS PARENTS. WE SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL TO BE EDUCATED. NOT INDOCTRINATED. IN S. R. FORTY FIVE. AS I UNDERSTAND AIMS TO PROTECT TEACHERS FROM. RETRIBUTION FROM EXPRESSING VIEWPOINTS THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL IN THE CLASSROOM- WHETHER BY STUDENTS OR THE ADMINISTRATORS. AND THAT'S A- LAUDABLE EFFORT I WOULD SAY BUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE AT HARVARD STUDENTS ANY CURRENT OR FORMER. BUT MINISTRATION OFFICIAL FROM APPEARING AS A SPEAKER ON THE CAMPUS OF KEEPING OTHER STUDENTS FROM HEARING A MESSAGE THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY FOUND THE% ELEMENTS OF THE CONVERSATION MIGHT BE TO CONTROVERSY. SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT KIND OF DOUBLE STANDARD WE ARE ENCOURAGING HERE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE WANT TO PROTECT TEACHERS IN ANY VIEW POINTS THAT THEY MAY WISH TO EXPRESS IN THE CLASSROOM WHETHER. SOMEONE AGREES WITH IT OR NOT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE NOT PROTECTING STUDENTS AS WELL- THAT WAS THE BILL ACTUALLY WAS MY BILLS I'M HAPPY TO HEAR YOU WOULD SUPPORT A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD PROTECT STUDENTS IT WAS S. B. TWO FORTY NINE IT WAS VOTED DOWN IN COMMITTEE SO I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE AGAIN. THAT- AS THE SAYING GOES WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER AND IF WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR TEACHERS. AND OUR- FACULTY IN UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AS WELL THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISPARITY HERE AND WHAT THE STATE THE MESSAGE OF THE STATE IS SENDING. OUT TO OUR UNIVERSITY SO WITH THAT SAID- I WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THIS RESOLUTION TODAY BECAUSE I THINK. IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT COMPLETE. YOU KNOW THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PACKAGE SO BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS THOUGH I. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I SUPPORT PEOPLE HAVING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S JUST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STUDENTS HAVE THE SAME FREEDOM OF SPEECH THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. UNDER EGGMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT CENTER PAN AM I'M WONDERING AS AS SOMEBODY WAS ALSO A CLASSROOM PROFESSOR A TENURE CLASSROOM PROFESSOR- AND THE PURPOSE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND TENURE HISTORICALLY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE WERE TEACHING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE OUTSIDE- SEE SAY THE MOORS THE- THE GOVERNMENT AS IT WERE BECAUSE OUR ACADEMIC. LEGACIES CAME FROM OTHER PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND COULD BE FIRED FOR SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE. NOT NOT A LONG LINE WITH THE CHURCH OR NOT ALIGNED WITH SOMETHING ELSE. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS ACADEMIC FREEDOM AT THE FACULTY FOR COLLEGE LEVELS RIGHT TO THESE PEOPLE BY DEFINITION ARE NOT CHILDREN BUT ARE IT PROBABLY AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MAYBE THERE'S A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD BRIGHT PERSON IN THERE OR EVEN UP TO. THIS TO SIXTY OR SIXTY FIVE RIGHT SO AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STUDENTS AND WILLINGLY WENT TO CLASS SIGNED UP FOR THE CLASS IS GOING TO THE CLASS BEFORE YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS LIKE REDEFINE OR RE VERIFY. THAT FACULTY MEMBERS WHO ARE TEACHING IN A DESIGN SUBJECT MATTER THAT THEY ARE OFTENTIMES HAVE A PHD IN WOULD BE FREE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH THAT THE STUDENTS TO THEIR FULL ABILITY. AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT MAINTAINING THEIR EMPLOYMENT NOT ABOUT THEIR OPTION TO TAKE A CLASS OR NOT WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO A UNIVERSITY TO BECOME A STUDENT IS THAT CORRECT. SENATOR MEN WILL YOU TAKE A QUESTION I WILL TAKE THE QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CENTER EGGMAN. SOB YES I THE GOAL OF DISABILITIES INCLUDED TWO IS TO. REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND BY THAT I DON'T JUST MEAN HAVING CONTROVERSIAL VIEW. BUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS TO TEACH CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECTS. WITHOUT FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT FEAR OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED RETRIBUTION. WHICH WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO OFTEN IN RECENT MONTHS AND YEARS. I ANSWER THIS IS PARTICULARLY PERNICIOUS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL BECAUSE MANY THAT FACULTY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. DON'T HAVE THE TYPE OF JOB SECURITY. THAT THEIR UC AND CSU TENURE COUNTERPART DO. AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE TO MY COLLEAGUE- WE SPOKE EARLIER THAT- THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE FOSTER HEALTHY DIALOGUE AND I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS DIALOGUE BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. OF THE TYPE OF DIALOGUE THAT THAT WE LIKE TO PROMOTE AND IN CLASSROOMS I THINK IT SAID. AGAIN AT THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY DISCUSSION. OF CONFLICTING VIEWS. AT BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THE PROFESSOR THE PERSON LEADING THAT DISCUSSION. HAS TO FEEL FREE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THOSE. OPINIONS TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THAT DIALOGUE WITHOUT FEAR. THAT SOME CLIP IS GOING TO GET OUT ON THE INTERNET THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT- AND AGAIN I FEAR THAT. I THINK THE VALUES ARE EXPRESSED EARLIER ABOUT HAVING OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS ABOUT HAVING CONTROVERSIAL VIEWS. ABOUT THIS TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE DO SOMETHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOOD BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS CONTROVERSIAL POSITION. ANY FURTHER. OR DEBATE.
