00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:45.357
FROM TERRORISTS IS NOT

AND- IT DOESN'T END ANY.

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:53.565
PRACTICE REFLECTION CONNECTING

THE NATION'S SERVICE BY WHICH

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.103
THE ENGINE IT IS NOT A LOT SO

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.471
THIS WOULD BE A WAY THAT TE

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:02.741
CPC AND A LEGISLATURE CAN

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:05.777
ENSURE THAT THAT COMMUNITY-

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.279
THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE NEEDS AND

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:09.581
IN FACT. REVEALING WHAT IS WHAT

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.817
IS BEING DONE SO THAT THERE IS

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:13.919
NO- CONTINUATION IN SERVICE

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:20.158
WITHOUT. THE APPROPRIATE

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:21.626
PROCESS. I'M STILL LOOKING FOR-

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:22.961
IF IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN UNDER

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.596
CURRENT STATUTE STATES THAT YOU

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:27.432
CANNOT REPLACE- APPOINTMENT

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:30.368
WITH INFERIOR TECHNOLOGY I JUST

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:30.936
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:34.906
TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE FOR.

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.209

THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE- THAT

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:54.693
SO IT'S A WAY TO PREVIEW WHAT

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.194
IS TO BE. I THINK GENERALLY THE

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.763
QUESTION IS IT NOT ALLOWED NOW

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.166
AND IF IT ISN'T ALLOWED. WHAT

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:02.901
IS THIS HOW DOES THE BILL THIS

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:06.171
BILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THAT

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:08.073
SAID FURTHER ADDRESS IT DOES IT-

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:10.909
RESTATED OR IS THE LANGUAGE IN

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:13.011
THE BILL WHAT CAUSES IT NOT TO

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:15.113
BE ALLOWED IT I JUST JUST A

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.682
LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION IF.

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:18.216

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:23.655
QUESTION. YES MY UNDERSTANDING

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:26.491
IS THAT. IT IS NOT ALLOWED AND

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:29.661
IN IN. A LOT RIGHT NOW AND THE

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:31.663
BILL WOULD BE A WAY TO CHECK.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.598
THAT THE PROVIDER IS NOT DOING

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:37.068
THAT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:37.736
TO REALISTICALLY AND

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:40.272
PRACTICALLY CHECK. THAT OUT

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:43.008
THERE THAT THIS PRACTICE ISN'T-

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:45.610
ISN'T HAPPENING. AND CULD YOU

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.178
AT LEAST TO PROVIDE US SOME

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.713
LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.916
BILL WOULD DO THAT WHAT. WHAT

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:53.718
IS THE ACTUAL. CONTROL THAT'S

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:57.656
PUT INTO PLACE. THAT WOULD

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.791
ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:03.795
YES THE BILL- OKAY WHEN WE TRY

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.764
TO MAKE A CHANGE AT THE PNC

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.766

WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:34.205
RELEASED ITS NEEDS ASSESSMENT

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.307
AND IDENTIFIED MORE THAN THREE

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.208
HUNDRED TWENTY WATER SYSTEMS

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.209
THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY FAILING

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.477
TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.045
SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THEN

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.447
ALSO IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.015
SIX HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS- THEY

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:47.051
WERE AT RISK OF FAILING A

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.786
CONSISTENT THEME THROUGHOUT

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.054
THAT ANALYSIS IS THAT THE

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.422
SYSTEM SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:52.823

DRINKING WATER AND IN SOME

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.396
CASES WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.631
FOR THESE SYSTEMS IS TO MERGE

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:01.932
WITH A LARGER SYSTEM THAT HAD

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.901
SUFFICIENT SCALE AND PROVEN

CONSOLIDATION OF WATER SYSTEMS

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.651
MAKES THE MOST SENSE. I MEAN IF

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:21.986

LARGER WATER SUPPLIER REGULATED
