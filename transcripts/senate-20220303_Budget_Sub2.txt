THE COMMITTEE SAID REQUIRED IN SIGN IT BUT HE ASSOCIATES HIMSELF WITH THE LETTER WAS SENT TO- THE DIRECTOR LAST WEEK THE DIRECTOR RESPONDED YESTERDAY WITH OF A FIVE PAGE LETTER SO WE HAVE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS AND DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE- HAS.

REQUIRED YEAH STERN HERE OKAY QUORUM IS BEEN ESTABLISHED DIRECTOR MARGIE WAGNER PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATE. WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE I KNOW YOU ALL ARE VERY VERY BUSY AND SO I WILL KEEP MY PRESENTATION RELATIVELY SHORT BUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE CAME BACK AND ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT THREE HEATH THINGS ABOUT THAT HARTMAN IS WORKING ON- AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO BUILDING OUR CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND MEETING THE BOTH LEGISLATIVE GOALS AND MANDATE. AND THAT YOU ALL HAVE GIVEN US THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING THAT I IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU I HAVE A PRESENTATION AND I WILL SHARE MY SCREEN HERE. AND EVERYBODY SEE THAT L. A SLIDE SHOW ARE YOU JUST DOING IS GREAT. JUST THE SCREEN COURSE I HAD IT BEFORE AND NOW IT'S NOT WORKING. HE. I DO IT. IMAGE APOLOGIES SENATOR. OKAY EDIBLE FOOD RECOVERY GRANT PROGRAM THE CENTER RIGHT GOOD OKAY HERE WE GO. AND SO IF YOU'LL DAHLE THREE JUST FOR A SECOND I WANTED TO SHARE POWER CYCLE HAS ADOPTED A NEW MISSION STATEMENT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND THAT WE HAVE NOW PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE AS OF LAST MONTH AND THAT REALLY TRULY REFLECTS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DIRECTED US TO GO IN THE IMPORTANT MISSION THAT WE HAVE IN FOR FILLING THE ENVIRONMENTAL- GOALS AND MANDATES AND NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION STATEMENT IS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE FOR THE HEALTH AND PROSPERITY OF FUTURE GENERATIONS TO THE REDUCTION REUSE RECYCLING OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION DISASTER RECOVERY AND THE TRANSITION FROM A DISPOSAL TO A FULLY CIRCULAR pMOUTHFUL BUT WE TAKE OUR MISSION VERY SERIOUSLY AND IN COMING TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND SHARING THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU ASKED US TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CIRCULAR ECONOMY GRANT. WHERE WE ARE IN IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW- TODAY DISASTER DEBRIS RECOVERY OPERATION AND WHERE ARE WE ON AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM ALL REALLY TRULY GOES TO MEETING THIS NEW MISSION THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED IN ADOPTED IN REALLY TRULY- AND MEETING AS THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE THAT WE AT AND THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE THAT WE TRANSITION TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST. I'M VERY PROUD TO SHARE. AT WE HAVE AT THE ARE THE I BELIEVE- NINE AND ALLOCATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED AND THEN- BUDGET LAST YEAR THAT YOU ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRESS ON WHERE WE ARE IN AND ALLOCATION AND EXPENDITURE OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE APPROPRIATE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- YOU WILL SEE VERY NINE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE AND HOW IT'S BEEN DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO YEARS- AS YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE DOLLARS THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION WAS APPROPRIATED OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT'S BEEN DIVVIED UP BETWEEN THE TWO YEARS. AT THIS NEXT FIGHT IS WHAT I THINK AND FOR ME AS A VISUAL LEARNER IS REALLY- ILLUSTRATES THE DEPARTMENT- COMMITMENT WE DEVELOP TO THIS TIMELINE AND THE DAY AFTER THE LEGISLATURE- AND PASSED AND THEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AT THE BUDGET SO THAT WE CAN FACILITATE GETTING AS MUCH MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO AS YOU WILL SEE OUR FIRST RAMP PROGRAM AT THE TOP OUR ORGANICS WHAT WE CALL THE B. LIST WHICH WAS I GRANT THAT HAD- AND- I ELIGIBLE FOR OUR LAST YEAR'S GRANT BUT- WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FIND. WE AND- REACHED OUT TO THE AWARDS IN OUR FAT AND OUR PUBLIC MEETING IN FEBRUARY. I'M I WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE BUT JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE HERE THAT WE ARE ALREADY MAKING AWARDS FOR SO THE ORGANICS THE LAST- WE ARE MOVING THROUGH OUR CO DIGESTION. WHICH IS A NEW GRANT PROGRAM ARE CO DIGESTION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH WE WILL BE OUT MAKING AWARDS LATER THIS SUMMER AND AS WE DEVELOP THAT CRITERIA WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE FALL. AND THE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS THE SIXTY MILLION THAT GOES TO OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. OUR ORGANICS WASTE PROGRAMS AT WE WENT ABOUT VERY QUICKLY SCOPING OUT THAT GRAHAM PROGRAM DEVELOPING CRITERIA AND WE DID IT IN A WAY THAT WAS FORMULAIC. TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING BUT ALSO SO THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS USE THIS TO TRULY AND TO TRULY IMPLEMENT AND- AUGMENT THE EFFORTS THAT THEY'RE MAKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IMPLEMENTOR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE WE RECEIVED FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY APPLICATIONS. THE DEADLINE WAS. AND IN JANUARY AND WE WILL BE MAKING THOSE A WAR. THE FIRST ROUND OF AWARDS WILL GO OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS BUT DO NOT HAVE AN ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION IN PLACE AS PROVIDED BY- THE REGULATIONS AND- ON JANUARY FIRST BUT FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND. WE WILL HAVE A SECOND PERIOD OF AWARDS THAT WILL HAPPEN THIS SUMMER SO RECOGNIZING SOME OF THAT SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS. AND HAVE STRUGGLED TO MEET THE JANUARY FIRST DEADLINE WE ARE WORKING WITH THOSE JURISDICTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS THIS GRANT PROGRAM TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS THAT THE JURISDICTIONS HAVE- I KNOW AS A DIRECTOR. MUCH LIKE A PARENT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE A FAVORITE PROGRAM BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROGRAMS IS THE EDIBLE FOOD RECOVERY PROGRAM AS YOU ALL KNOW AND- AND HAVE I PROVIDED APPROPRIATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO THIS PROGRAM. FROM GIGI R. F. WE HAVE AWARDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BRANSON'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL. FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WENT OUT FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TO. FACILITATE ED- ET PROJECTS- ACROSS EIGHTY DIFFERENT AS AND I'LL GRANT GRANTEES- FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NONPROFIT. AND IT IS LOCATED. ALMOST A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MEALS SERVED TO- OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE FOOD INSECURE. AND IT ALSO IS AT THE END THAT IT WAS ALL FOOD THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE GONE TO WASTE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND CARS OFF OF THE ROAD- WITH THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GRANTS SO WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THIS PROGRAM. AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED NEW CRITERIA OUT WE WANTED TO AND- UPDATE OUR CRITERIA FOR THIS PROGRAM TO TRY TO REACH SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WORK. I REACHED IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS OF GRANTS- INCLUDING PRIORITIZING- I'M OUR TRIBAL NATION PARTNERS AND WE HAD RECEIVED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GRANT APPLICATIONS. ARE FOR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WAR SO WE WILL BE MAKING THE FIRST AWARDS I'M HERE IN MARCH AND JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU WILL SEE THAT FIRST LAST. AND I HAVE A PROJECT THAT WILL BE AWARDED WITH THE FIRST THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN WE WILL BE DOING A SECOND AWARD IN JULY WITHOUT MONEY. I'M AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LIST YOU WILL SEE THOSE THAT WE ARE SOME NEWER PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY COMPOSTING IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM BUT WE ARE UPDATING THOSE CRITERIA TO AGAIN. TRY TO FACILITATE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND DOING MORE OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES THAT WE HADN'T PREVIOUS READ SO ARE STILL. THIS TIME- AS WE ARE WARNING THESE OTHER GRANTS REALLY LOOKING AT THE CAPACITY PLANS THAT WILL BE COMING IN THE SPRING FROM OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO WE OVERLAY. THE RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN US AND TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED IN THE STATE- FROM OUR LARGE PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE LIKE HEY DIGESTION AND ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. YOU ARE SMALLER PROJECTS LIKE COMMUNITY COMPOST AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST WE ARE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ROLLING OUT- AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS NOW AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WE AND- PROVIDE GRANTS FOR RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY THIS IS A BRAND NEW CONCEPT HERE WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP. THE FEASIBILITY PLANNING CAPACITY HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP. ATTRACT PRIVATE BUSINESSES THAT CAN REALLY FILL GAPS WITHIN OUR CIRCULAR ECONOMY THIS IS REALLY EXCITING AS WE- ARE BUILDING OUT OUR OFFICE OF INNOVATION RIGHT NOW AND- AND- GETTING READY TO HIRE THE LEAD OF THAT OFFICE. THIS WILL BE A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO OUTREACH TO SOME OF THOSE INNOVATORS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT REALLY CREATIVE IDEAS. AROUND NOT ONLY RECYCLING BUT REMANUFACTURING AND HOW CAN WE REALLY CHANGE THE MARKET ALLEN AND PUT CALIFORNIA AT THE LEAD NOT ONLY FOR THE NATION BUT THE GLOW- IN BUILDING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY SO ALL OF THIS TOGETHER GOES TO WHAT. YOU THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US LAST YEAR IF YOU DEVELOP A CIRCULAR ECONOMY PLAN AND I THINK WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY. AND TO MAKING. A GREAT DEAL OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS- I HAVE A- OF- JUST I CAN ROLL QUICKLY THESE A COUPLE OF- GRANTEE ILLUSTRATIONS HERE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE ORGANICS BRAND SO YOU CAN SEE. WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT AROUND COMPOSTING- THIS YEAR AND THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS I'M A COUPLE OF THE INNOVATIVE IDEAS AROUND- ANAEROBIC DIGESTION AND THEN THE CITY OF STAND AS STUDY VEIL IS THAT IS. BEING UP IN THE AND USING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES I'M WHICH I THINK WILL BE A REALLY EXCELLENT COMPLEMENT TO WHAT WE- ARE SEEING BILLS ACROSS THE STATE AROUND CO DIGESTION. SO ALL OF THIS TOGETHER WILL GO WITH THE COMMUNITY COMPOST ACT SB CAPACITY PLANS THAT WE SHOULD BE SEEING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. TO HELP US REALLY DRY OUT A MAP AND A LANDSCAPE OF WHERE OUR RESOURCES ARE MOST NEEDED- AND THEN HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR WE CAN HAVE A NUMBER NOTHER CONVERSATION OF REALLY WHAT THAT LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAD TO GIVE THE IS LEGISLATURE AN IDEA OF HOW WE'RE DOING AND. AND WHERE WE'RE DOING OUR BEST WORK. I'M THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF OUR EDIBLE FOOD RECOVERY GRANT PROGRAM I STAFF YOUR ACCOUNT WAS LIKE ALWAYS KNOW THAT I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU'RE A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT MAKES A HUGE IMPACT- OUT OF VERY VERY GRASSROOTS LEVEL SO THIS IS THE ST FRANCIS CENTER IN LOS ANGELES WE GAVE THEM SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE. THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PURCHASE TWO REFRIGERATED BOX TRUCK SO THIS IS REALLY JUST INFRASTRUCTURE- AND IT FACILITATED. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS OF EDIBLE FOOD RECOVERED IT IS JUST REALLY- REALLY PHENOMENAL- AGAIN I HAD THE CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO COUNTY FOOD BANK AND AS WAS AWARDED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SOME TRACKS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AND THEY'VE RESCUED- OF OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD TO DATE- AND ARE ARE PRETTY PROVIDING SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE LOCAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES- SO I WILL SKIP AHEAD. THIS IS OUR CO DIGESTION PLANTS- IN AND- LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ALSO IT'S AND DIVERTING- AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF- AS FAST FOOD WASTE FROM THE LANDFILLS ALREADY I'M TO GO TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WE ARE- SPREADING OUR OUR RESOURCES ACROSS THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF YOUR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED MUCH MUCH MORE OF THAT IN THE COMING YEARS I'M SO WITH THAT AND BEFORE I MOVE ON TO DEBRIS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ON- ORGANIC WASTE AND OUR. CIRCULAR ECONOMY BRANDS. GO AHEAD AND KEEP GOING OUR MY NUMBERS KEEP. HOW DO YOU GET IT JUST MAKE SURE I KNOW I'M I KNEW SHOES NUMBERS QUICK JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M NOT WE ANY. SO I HAD THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT I COME AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND THE PROGRESS WITH OUR DISASTER DEBRIS RECOVERY OPERATION OUR FUTURE- DIVISION WE ARE REALLY REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST YEAR AND WHEN I CME ON BOARD I SAT DOWN WITH THE DIVISION HAD- TINA WALKER TO TALK ABOUT HER DIVISION AND WE- QUICKLY IDENTIFIED- SOME CHANGES THAT COULD BE MADE TO MAKE HER DIVISION WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY SHE- JOINED US FROM- HELLO YES. AND SO IT BECAME VERY OBVIOUS AND NATURAL FOR US TO REFORM HER DIVISION TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM TELL. YOU THE FIRST SECOND I'M GONNA READ SOME NUMBERS BECAUSE I'M NOT OTHERWISE GOING TO REMEMBER IT AND EVERYTHING THAT SHE SHARED WITH ME THAT AND WE HAVE AT CREATED THREE TEAMS. AND THAT CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEPLOYED ACROSS THE STATE OR CONTRACT. MANAGEMENT HEALTH AND SAFETY- I ALAN'S I- HAVE. I THINK SENATOR MCGUIRE ONE OF THESE SPECIFICALLY STAFFING WE HAVE FAILED ALMOST ALL OF THOSE POSITIONS WE ARE GOING TO WE FAILED OUR THREE WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEERS. AS AND JUST THIS PAST MONTH I FEBRUARY WE ARE WORKING ON INTERVIEWS RIGHT NOW FOR OUR NEW WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEERS- THAT WERE RE CLASSIFIED TO A GPAS FOR OUR CONTRACT MANAGERS. AND THEN WE FILLED OUR NEW SENIOR WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEERED SUPERVISORY ROLE IN SEPTEMBER I'M AND THEN WE HAVE ONE ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST THAT IS GOING TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO A STAFF SERVICES THIS IS ALL GUYS DOUBLES. I WILL DIE WILL SKIP AHEAD I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I'M I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS STARTED. AND THAT WILL BE ADVERTISED IN MARCH SO WE HAVE SOME STAFFING THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING ON DOING BUT WE ARE OUT BY THIS SPRING- AND IT IS A PAINTING BEING FULLY STAFFED UP WITH THE THREE TEAMS THAT WE HAVE REDEVELOPED AND RE CLASSIFIED. FOR THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE FIELD- ADDITIONALLY WHEN I CAME ON BOARD IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE CLASSIFICATIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT FIT FOR THE KIND OF WORK THAT WAS NEEDED. AND LIKE I SAID- HE DID A GREAT JOB AND HELPING US. VERY QUICKLY TO BUILD- AT THE BACK DISASTER DEBRIS TEAMS THAT ARE EASILY AND QUICKLY DEPLOY- AND TO ILLUSTRATE THAT. OUT WE WERE DEPLOYING AND ISSUING CONTRACTS COURTESY OF OUR LEGAL TEAM AND OUR ARJUN DISASTER TEAM- BEFORE THE DIXIE FIRE WAS- DONE BURNING- UNFORTUNATELY AS WE ALL KNOW IT BURN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT WE WERE ABLE TO START OUR DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATION EVEN BEFORE THE FIRE HAD COMPLETED- AND- EVEN FURTHER ILLUSTRATION. CAL RECYCLE AND HELLO YES WE ARE INDEED HAND PARTNERS- IN AND MEETING THE RECOVERY MISSION. ON AND OUR PARTNERS AT DGSE- THE STATE OF COLORADO AS THEY- EXPERIENCE THEIR DAMAGE DEVASTATION EARLIER THIS YEAR OR LATE LAST YEAR. AND REACHED OUT TO US TO ASK HOW DO YOU DO A DEBRIS RECOVERY OPERATION POST WILDFIRE BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE THIS YEAR AND SAW THAT WE HAD HAD SUCCESSFULLY- BUILD A SYSTEM. AND THAT IS THAT IS WORKING SO. TO THAT POINT- OR AT AS- OVERALL- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN- WE'VE CLEANED UP TWENTY THREE THOUSAND HOMES RESPONDED TO OVER FIFTY DISASTERS- AND HAVE BEEN IN THIRTY THREE COUNTIES- BUT WHAT REALLY GOES TO ILLUSTRATE WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS. ALL RIGHT ON WHAT IS TODAY MARCH THIRD WE ARE 77% DONE WITH THE STRUCTURAL DEBRIS REMOVAL FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- DISASTERS- I THINK JUST HOVERING AROUND 20% DONE WITH THE TREE REMOVAL- FROM FROM THESE DISASTERS WHICH AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WHO ARE ARE TRACKING EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO RECOVERY IS REALLY VERY VERY CHALLENGING AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE VERY REMOTE- AND DESPITE. THE WEATHER CHALLENGES THAT WE EXPERIENCED AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEGINNING A TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE ARE MAKING INCREDIBLE HEADWAY AND REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLOSE OUT THIS OPERATION. BEEN FINISH THE DEBRIS REMOVAL- BY THE SPRING WHICH IS JUST INCREDIBLE- AND SO I REALLY JUST WANT TO APPLY TO THE TEAM HERE AT OUR CYCLE AND HELLO YES AND THE- AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD. I'M LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE WE ARE AND WE ARE. VERY EXCITED THAT WE ARE ROLLING OUT SOME NEW TOOLS THAT WE HAVE A MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT FOR OUR MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT CONTRACTS THAT WENT OUT TO BED AND AT MARCH SECOND IT WILL BE BACK ON MARCH ELEVENTH- AND SO FOR OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS WE WILL HAVE A READY MADE TOOL. AND ALREADY- HAVE CONTRACTORS- READY AND WAITING- DO YOU TO GO TO% WORK AT FOR OUR FUTURE. OPERATIONS THROUGH THAT MSA AND- THROUGH GDS IS HELPING DEVELOP NOT. FOR OUR CONTRACTORS ARE REMOVING AND DOING THE ACTUAL DEBRIS REMOVAL YOU ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A PRE QUALIFIED BIDDERS LESS SO AN MSA WAS NOT THE APPROPRIATE TOOL. FOR THOSE CONTRACTS BUT WE ARE DEVELOPING A PRE QUALIFIED BIDDER LESS TO GET AND DISTILLATE TATE A VERY QUICK DEPLOYMENT WHEN I'M AT AT EIGHT AND DISASTER OCCURS. AT SO WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING- THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THIS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS WE AS I'VE ACTUALLY SAID. HAVE BEEN- BUILDING THIS PLANE AS WERE FLYING AND LANDING AT ALL AT ONE TIME ON A VERY STRICT TIMELINE POST DISASTER SO WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS- IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S- VISIBLE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING. EVERY DAY IN THIS PROGRAM- WITH OUR OTHER STATE PARTNERS SO I AM VERY EXCITED TO SHARE THAT. WITH ALL OF YOU AND SENATOR THAT FINAL HE'S IS THERE A- BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP THERE AND- AND THEN JUMP IN OR IF YOU WANT TO KEEP UP. FOLLOWS ONE OF WE HAVE CENTER DOLLY HAS A QUESTION ON THE- WILDFIRE DEBRIS CLEAN. RIGHT SO. SOMEBODY WHO IS EXPERIENCED THE CAMPFIRE. THE CAR FIRE IN THE DIXIE FIRE ALL DEVASTATING- COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPERIENCED IS THAT WHEN YOU SAID YOU HAD PRE QUALIFIED- OF. DEBRIS REMOVAL PEOPLE. WHAT IS A COMMUNITY JUST BURN DOWN AND YOU DON'T USE THE CAR. IN THE COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY. REBUILD OUR COMMUNITY OR OR CLEAN UP THEIR COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A DOUBLE HIT BECAUSE THE CONTRACTORS COME. FROM OUT OF THE AREA THAT ARE PRE QUALIFIED AND SO I WORKED WITH UP. MARK GHILARDUCCI AND CAL AND- CALLOW YES ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCALS. HAVE THE WORK BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU BRING THE CONTRACTORS FOR SOMEONE'S WE SAW THIS ON THE ORAL DAM AND WE SAW THIS ON ALL THE PROJECTS THAT- WERE DISASTER PROJECT AND SO I AM VERY. CONCERNED THAT YOU'D- MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCALS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE DOLLARS THAT. ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO REVITALIZE IT STAY IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S A DOUBLE HIT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT IS SESSION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT POINT SENATORS AT SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT. IN PREVIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGAIN EVERY YEAR IS A NEW LEARNING OPPORTUNITY AS WE AS WE REALLY BELT. AND OF THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AT A STATE RUN RECOVERY OPERATION. BUT I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN PREVIOUS OPERATIONS AND THIS CONTRACT FOR THIS YEAR WE NOT ONLY GAVE PREFERENCE THATREALLY LOOKED FOR- VISIBLE METRICS- FROM OUR CONTRACTORS ON HIRING LOCAL WORK FORCE AND WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS AS WE DEVELOP OUR PRE. PRE QUALIFIED BIDDER LAST WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH- LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS- LOCAL LABEL OR DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS ON HOW DO WE BEST INTEGRATE. OUT LOCAL AND HIRING PRACTICES INTO OUR PRE QUALIFIED BIDDER- PRACTICE OF THIS IS ERY MUCH A PART OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE A VERY STRONG POLICY AND ROLL OUT AS PROJECT PART OF OUR PRE QUALIFIED FEDERALIST. BUT I COULDN'T AGREE MORE- HAVE GONE TO GREEN I WHEN HE SENATOR. AND ENDING UP AT THE DIXIE FIRE AND SEE ANTI COME. ABSOLUTE DEBT. AND REALLY WANT A TO BE AND PART OF THEIR RICK. REALLY TO. THAT THAT- INVESTMENTS- IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND FACILITATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR- THESE THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES BUT ALSO THEIR JOBS TO REALLY- PART OF THE RECOVERY AND WORK THROUGH THIS WITH US AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT COMMENT. I JUST WANT TO GO ON THE RECORD BECAUSE THAT ALWAYS IT'S NOT ALWAYS WORK THE WAY. THAT WE WANTED TO WORK AND THAT MEANS THAT THE LOCAL THE LOOK THAT THE PRE APPROVED CONTRACTORS. TYPICALLY ARE NOT FROM THE AREA THERE STATEWIDE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE BIG CONTRACTORS BUT THE SUBJECT OR NEED THEM- SHOULD BE COMING FROM THE LOCAL AREA AND I NOTICE IT YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THERE BUT- ON THE GROUND. YOU CAN GO TALK TO THE LOCAL CONTRACTORS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT WORKING AND THEY DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD NOT THE COMMITTEE HERE NO. BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCED IT MANY TIMES AND IT'S REALLY NOT FAIR- BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING TOWARDS A BETTER. HOPEFULLY GOD WILLING WE WON'T HAVE A LOT MORE THESE DEVASTATING YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES BEING DESTROYED- BUT IT SEEMS TO BE HAPPEN MORE AND MORE SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD YOU KNOW THAT IS IT ISN'T AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE LOCAL CONTRACTORS WORKING IN THEIR THERE AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND THAT MONEY STAYS IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU IT IS EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT SENATOR. SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER AT FIRST AND FOREMOST ON ON THE ISSUE OF DEBRIS AND DEBRIS HAULING I WANT TO. TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTOR. AND THE DIRECTOR HAS BEEN. ENGAGED AND INVOLVED AND ALL ISSUES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HER TENURE HERE. LAST YEAR IT CARRIED CYCLE AND THIS ONE IS HOW GRATEFUL I AM. INDEED JUST. BACKGROUND CARRY CYCLE. IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT AGENCY THAN WHAT THEY WERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. ESPECIALLY WITH THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THESE WILDFIRES OVERSEE- FIVE WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE VALLEY FIRE VALLEY FIRE WAS THE FIRST. MASSIVE FIRE THAT CAN RECYCLE TO CONSOLE LEAD TO BE ABLE TO- CLEAN UP COMMUNITIES IN LAKE COUNTY. AND THAT AND THEN UNDER DIRECTOR MISALIGNED- IN GRATEFUL TO TRIGGER WAGNER FOR HER. FOCUS ON THIS. PROJECT AND TALK ABOUT SOME SPECIFICS IN REGARDS TO THE POSITIONS THAT AMOUNT OF DIRECTOR YOU JUST MENTIONED. YOU IT SAID THE VAST MAJORITY NOT HAVE BEEN HIRED LAST YEAR IN THIS BUDGET SUB THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES ABOUT BRINGING FOLKS. ON BOARD IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE US SOME SPECIFICS ON THAT AND THEN I WILL GO TO MY. SECOND QUESTION THE MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT. OF COURSE SENATOR SO. AND EXIT AND GET HAULAGE FOR GETTING INTO SOME SERVICE SPEAK BUT AS I NOTED- WE HAVE. REORGANIZED TO THIS DIVISION AND TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE DIVISION COMMANDER AFTER COMMANDER TO REAL QUICK CAN WE TAKE. THE SLIDE DOWN TO SO WE CAN SEE THE DIRECTOR SCREEN IS A FULL. SORRY SECOND. YOU CAN ARE SHARING YOUR- THAT WERE YEAH WELL GO RIGHT TO INSECT THANK YOU SO MUCH DIRECTOR VERY HIGH IT'S. FONG I WOULD JUST OUT IS. AND NOT MANY FOR DO- ONLINE PRESENCE. I SO FOLLOWS NOW LIVING THE DREAM SOON THESE. I TOTALLY GET IT. HEY AS WE SAY. WE TOOK WHAT WAS. I MEAN REALLY DELYLAH. AS A CLEAN UP- JIM AND WE LOOK AT IT DID. BECAUSE OF THE NEED OF THESE AT BEING DESIGNED RECOVERY AND I'M RESPONSE. WE KEPT AT EXPERTISE IN RESPONSE AND WE TOOK A AND I'VE HEARD OF IT TO LOOK MORE LIKE A NUMBER WITH TO BE. SO ARE BILL OR HAVE NOW REACHED THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT HAVE AID FINANCE LEAD- WHICH IS THE CONTRACT MANAGER. AND TO SAFETY OFFICERS AT TWO DHUBRI GROUP SUPERVISORS SO ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN OUT TO AN OPERATION KNOWS THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ON VARIOUS SITES. AND SPENDING ALL OF THE PARCELS ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND ONE I'M OPERATIONAL PLANNING LEAVE AND. IT COINCIDES VERY VERY WELL. WITH THE TEAMS. ECHO ADD CALLAWAY. AND IT ALIGNS VERY WELL SO ONCE WE DID THAT I WHAT I LIKE TO ASK ACTUALLY TO AS A MINI. AND RE CLASSIFY AND SOME THE POSITIONS WE HAVE FROM LAST YEAR I'M HONESTLY AS I HAD TO TELL YOU AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE PREVIOUS OPERATIONS- I DECIDED THAT THEY NO LONGER WANTED TO BE IN THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEPLOYED FOR SIX SEVEN EIGHT MONTHS OF LAST YEAR AND- THE TOLD IT TOOK ON THEM PERSONALLY. WAS A LOT AND THEY WANTED SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK THOSE OPEN POSITIONS WE RE CLASSIFIED THEM TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SPECIFIC JOBS THAT WE NEED UNDER THIS REORGANIZED STRUCTURE- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE. HERE WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINE ENGINEER POSITIONS THAT WERE RE CLASSIFIED Q. ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST WHICH IS A BROADER- CLASSIFICATION- FOR THE TO CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POSITIONS THOSE INTERVIEWS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO FILL THOSE TWO POSITIONS. WE HAD- THREE WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEERS THAT WERE RE CLASSIFIED- FOUR THREE DEBRIS GROUP SUPERVISORS POSITIONS THOSE ARE FILLED IN FEBRUARY- WE HAVE AT ONE SENIOR WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEER THAT WAS JUST TURNED INTO A SYMBOL OF SENIOR CIVIL ENGINEER. THAT WAS FILLED IN SEPTEMBER. AT AND THEN WE TOOK OUR GEOLOGIST AND TURNED IT INTO A STAFF SERVICES MANAGER POSITION SO MORE OF A MANAGEMENT POSITION- TO BECOME AS A TRIBAL COORDINATOR SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THAT WILL BE ADVERTISED HERE IN MARCH. AND SO AND YEAH ADICIONAL LEE WE ARE HIRING FOR A LIMITED TERM EIGHT GPAS FOR INVOICE. I INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW AND THEN- I. FOR FOUR FIELD OFF IN DEGREE GO. THE BRICKWORK SUPER. MY GOODNESS I'M SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE- OUR TO FILL. MODIFY AND- TEAMS FOR THREE CONCURRENT OPERATIONS BASED ON THE CURRENT STAFFING THAT WE HAVE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HADN'T SOLD ANY OF THOSE POSITIONS BUT MOST OF THOSE POSITIONS WERE FILLED- AND THEN WE HAD- AS- AS STAFF LEAVE. AS A AS A NOTED AND AFTER THE LAST OPERATION- AND NOW WE ARE STAFFING UP AGAIN AND TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE TEAM. WE SHOULD TURNED LOOK INTO THE I THINK OF THE ITEMS IT WOULD LIKE TO BE A LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE NOT AT THIS TIME. IS THAT OKAY CANDIDLY BURNOUT IS GONNA BE INCREDIBLY HIGH WITHIN THESE POSITIONS BEING DEPLOYED AND IN SUCH DRAMATIC- CIRCUMSTANCES SO I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO LOOK AT- WITH CAL RECYCLE IN THE FUTURE. I HAVEN'T CHECKED IN WITH THE DIRECTOR ON THIS BUT I IT'S VITAL WHICH GETS ME TO THE NEXT POINT. AND THAT'S ON THE MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT. LOOK BOTTOM LINE IS YEAR AFTER YEAR IT'S GETTING WORSE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT REMOVING- YOU COMPARE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. TO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR IT'S NIGHT AND DAY IT'S SIGNIFICANT. I'M IN WHAT I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTOR LOOKING AT. IS A MODERN DAY. REVAMP OF DEBRIS REMOVAL IN THE STATE. IN MANAGER AFTER I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING IN ON. RIGHT NOW IN THIS MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT YOU WOULD HAVE. A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRE QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS THOSE CONTRACTORS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO AGREE TO WHAT A SET OF STANDARDS WOULD BE THAT THE STATE WOULD EXPECT. AND YOU WOULD HAVE THEM PRE QUALIFIED SO THEY ARE PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE. HOPEFULLY HEFTY LIST SO THAT WERE MOVING. SEVERAL DEBRIS OPERATIONS AT A TIME. AND THEY CAN MOVE QUICKER THAN HAVING TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE A THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAY R. P. TO BE A TO BRING THEM IN BETTER DIRCTOR I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I AM TRACKING IN WHAT YOUR GOAL IS TO BE A TO GET THESE FIRMS ON BOARD. THAT IS THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT SENATOR SO FOR A LOT OF THE CONTRACT THESE ARE VERY VERY RIGHT HERE AT THE CENTER OF WHAT HOUSING AS A AS A HOMEWORK PROJECT THIRTY ONE NO. AT ITS CURRENT CONTRACT FOR YOU. JUST THANK YOUNG LITTLE HIRED AS- I'M THESE CONTRACTORS ARE. VERY VERY DETAIL AND- A LOT OF THE CON. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR CONTRACT AND SO IF YOU COME IN A BID TO US TODAY WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON- YOU ARE PRE QUALIFIED. WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC OPERATIONS SO IF IT'S A SMALL OPERATION AND- IN LAKE COUNTY OR A LARGE OPERATION. IN AB YOU COUNTY. YOU ARE ALREADY QUALIFIED AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFICS THEN THE AND DETAILS OF THAT OPERATION. WE WILL HAVE SOME ABILITY TO PICK THOSE THAT ARE. BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THAT OPERATION AND THEIR OVERALL ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THAT OPERATION BUT THEY WILL ALREADY BE QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE. IS HUGE IN THE LAST PIECE ON THIS AND I'LL DO THIS QUICKLY IS. WHAT YOU HAD SAID EARLIER AND PARAPHRASING- AND DIRECTORS ON THE ISSUE OF LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE DIFFERENT TRADES- WHETHER IT'S- COULD BE OPERATING JIM NEARS OR LABORERS- EXEDRA. WORKING WITH THEM SINCE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS- THE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL UP AND RUNNING AND THEN I THINK IT ACTUALLY GETS TO. SENATOR DONNELLY'S POINT. WITH THESE. THAT SPECIALIZE IN THE CITY'S CRASS- WHAT THAT QUALIFY WORK FOR RIGHT LIKE FOR. WITH PREMJI NEARS THEY CAN GET THEIR FOLKS UNDER HAS WHOPPER TRAINING. AND READY TO MOVE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT WORK FORCE READY TO MOVE ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE CORRECT. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. A LOT OF OUTRAGE AND A LOT MORE WORK TO REALLY AND HEALTH. I AND IT TOO MOSTLY THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS WITH WHETHER IT'S OPERATIONAL MANAGERS ARE THE LABORS FOR OUR LABOR DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE BOARDS IN- IN THESE REGIONS. TO SAY HERE'S THE SKILL SET THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HOW CAN WE START TO BRING IN. A BUILD OUT THIS WORK FORCE I THINK WE WERE ALL HOPEFUL AFTER CAMPFIRE- THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE LESS AND LESS OF THAT THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK YOU KNOW OUR REALITY- ACT. BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS THAT WHERE WE ARE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE GOING TO BE AND THE WILD FIRE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND DEBRIS BUSINESS. SO HOW DO WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT REALLY IS MOST RESPECTFUL TO THE TO THE VICTIMS OF THESE DISASTERS THAT REALLY GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THEIR RECOVERY. AND REALLY SERVESTHEM IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE- ANYTHING FALL. IS WHEN YOU'LL BE READY TO ROLL. THERE'S IT IS NOT WHAT THANK YOU. TO ME YOU KNOW I LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING TOMORROW BUT THERE LOT PEOPLE HAVE TO GET ON BOARD THAT WE THAT THINGS THAT WE DO IT SO I'M LEARNING THIS PAGE BUT ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO KNOW SENATOR SINCE WE WERE TALKING PLACES THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE TO DO- ARE IS I KNOW A LOT OF YOU AND HE REPRESENT AREAS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES ALSO REPRESENT SOME OF OUR TRIBAL NATIONS AND THIS IS ANOTHER PLACE THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION. WHERE WE BUILD STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT ARE OUR TRIBAL NATIONS I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND STRONGER COMMUNICATIONS THAT THAT IS SOMETHINGADDITIONALLY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THIS YEAR AND HOPING TO HAVE- A VERY STRONG- COMMUNICATION NETWORK. AS FOR THE NEXT OPERATION. OKAY. I GUESS IF YOU COULD JUST YOU KNOW WHEN AN AREA GETS DEVASTATED YOU HAVE THE DIXIE FIRED NINE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES WHERE IS THE CEMENT I ASSUME ALL THE CEMENT IS RECYCLED ALL THE WOODY DEBRIS WHAT IS USABLE WHAT'S NOT USABLE YOUR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TREES AND REMOVE SOME OF THEM ARE JUST DANGEROUS BUT ARE NOT DESTROYED HOW DOES IT IF EVERYTHING IF THE LUMBER YARD HAS BEEN BURNED DOWN WE'RE HOW DO YOU FEEL LOGISTICALLY TAKE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A PROPERLY DISPOSE OF AT THE END HOW DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION SENATOR SAID THIS IS PART OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR DEBRIS- REMOVAL CONTRACTORS IS THAT THEY NEED TO RECYCLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND WE HAVE SPECIFIC QUANTITIES IN TERMS OF TREES- AND- AND HIGHEST AND BEST USE OR AND THE DEBRIS PRIMARILY THE TREES AS YOU POINT OUT BUT IT DOES BECOME VERY COMPLICATED BECAUSE I E. SENTRIES AND IS- LASSEN COUNTY WHERE YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LUMBER YARD IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE TO VIEW COUNTY TO GET THEM TAKEN CARE OF SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OF OUR CONTRACTORS ON EACH OF OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THIS. SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE FIND IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION AND IT HAS BEEN A REAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR ME IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON BROWNFIELDS CLEANUPS AND THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION BECAUSE YOUARE NOT- AS METHODICAL ABOUT FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND IT'S NOT IN PLACES NECESSARILY THAT ARE PARTICULARLY EASY TO REACH AND YOU'RE WORKING REALLY REALLY FAST YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME OF THIS CHART IT OUT IN ADVANCE SO WHAT ARE PRE QUALIFIED LIST. THESE. ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN WE REQUIRE OUR OUR A CONTRACT. TO OUR LIVE US THE THEY- AND I ABOUT INTO THE SEA I'M THEY'RE GOING TO THIS OF THE- HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DISPOSE OF IT AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MEET THE BEST AND- THE BEST FINAL USE FOR THE DISPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY WE REQUIRE THEM TO USE OUT LOW MISSION VEHICLES- WHERE POSSIBLE SO WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY ASPECT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE FRENCH THAT ONE OF THESE OPERATIONS PASSED. AND ASKING THE QUESTION OF OUR CONTRACTORS BEFORE THEY EVER STEP ON THE FIELD OF HOW DO WE MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IN THIS IN THIS OPERATION WELL THANK YOU WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO. TODAY'S MAIN AFFAIR THE BOTTLE BILL OTHERS HAVE SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT- PRETTY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT WE ASKED IN THE- I WILL. ALLOW YOU TO ANSWER. THOSE AND CONTINUE YOUR PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW I COULD YOU. WE CAN'T A GREAT AND THE QUOTE OR- I DID JUST AND HAVE A COUPLE. OF LAKE. GETTING AT THIS I THINK MAYBE. I'M AT NOPE I'M NOT GETTING BETTER AT THIS I THOUGHT I WAS. HI DO I SHARE REYES VERY RECAP. ALL RIGHT THE COUPLE BY ON I THE NUMBER CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM AND AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW SINCE THE INCEPTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED BILLION CONTAINERS HAVE BEEN RECYCLED- THROUGH OUR PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M JUST LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I IT SAYS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN POINT SIX BUT- WE ARE CURRENTLY AND CONTINUE TO COMPILE THIS NUMBER AS OF YESTERDAY I THINK IT WAS HIGHER THAN EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION CONTAINERS RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM LAST YEAR I'M WHICH IS THE HIGHEST CONTAINER- NUMBER OF CONTAINERS- THAT WE HAVE EVER RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- LAUNCHED PILOT PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR AND IN CULVER CITY IRVINE. SAN FRANCISCO. SAN MATTEO THAT ARE UP AND RUNNING AND ONE ENDS AND NUMBER COUNTY THAT IS REALLY INNOVATING AROUND- DIDN'T AND UTILIZING PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS I'M THAT WILL BE ONLINE HERE- IN MARCH. I'M. ONE OF THE THINGS TAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT BEFORE WE GET INTO- THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT BUT I THINK WE'LL LUMINATE SOME OF THE ANSWERS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- IS THAT CALIFORNIA OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC SAYS SENSE BEGINNING OF- TWENTY TWENTY HAS SOLD MORE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAN EVER IN OUR HISTORY SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE- OF BAR CHART SAYS THE BEGINNING SENSE TWO THOUSAND- WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER SALES AND WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY JUMPING. FROM JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR- BILLION AT CONTAINER SOLD TO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WE CONTENT COMPLETE OUR- CALCULATIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT ROUGHLY TWENTY SEVEN BILLION CONTAINER INCREASED. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. I'M WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IN TERMS OF RETURNS- THIS NEXT CHART GOES TO SHOW YOU REALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF RETURNS IF YOU LOOK AT TWENTY TWENTY THAT DEATHS THAT YOU SEE THERE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THAT FIRST YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WE EXPERIENCED- FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS- AS MANY OF OUR RECYCLING CENTERS TEMPORARILY CLOSING DOWN FOR ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO SIX MONTHS I'M SO AB AND PEOPLE- STAYING IN PLACE. AND SO WE DID ALLOW EIGHTEEN BILLION RETURNS WHILE SEEING RECORD SALES- AND THEN HEARING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS I HIGHLIGHTED THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION WE ARE BACK UP OVER EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION- CONTAINERS RECYCLED. I'M SO THAT REALLY GOES TO ILLUSTRATE SORT OF THIS FLUCTUATION THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THIS PROGRAM- AND IF YOU WANT A SENATOR I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK- AND THE LETTER THAT YOU SENT- BUT- I THINK THAT THE- IT TO BE A LITTLE CHEEKY THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHY IS THE NUMBER. SO IS SUCH A HUGE DISCREPANCY FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LAST JANUARY AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE BUILD INTO THE BUDGET OR THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT. OR OR ANY OF THE OTHER. PLACES THAT WE WOULD PROJECT HOW THE THAT THE FUND IS GOING TO GO WERE OFF. USUALLY IN A RECESSION WHERE WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY DURING A RECESSION IS THAT BEVERAGE CONTAINER- SALES GOES DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY- BUT REDEMPTION EITHER IT STAYS PRETTY LEVEL OR BUMPS UP A LITTLE BIT AND SO WE DID NOT PROJECT- THE SALES THAT WE ENDED UP SEEING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTINUE TO SEE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS PART OF- THE REPORTS THAT WE DID THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE FUNDS WE WENT THE MORE CONSERVATIVE ROUTE OF PROJECTING. WHAT WOULD NORMALLY HAPPEN DURING A RECESSION- AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THE SEMIANNUAL REPORT IS REALLY AIMED AT MAKING SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS AWARE- WIN THIS FIGHT AND- IS STARTING TO DECREASE- IS AWARE WHEN- WE ARE PROJECTING A PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION IN AND THE FORMULAS FOR PAYMENTS. I'M RECTOR DIRECTOR LET ME I GUESS I MEAN WE ALL MADE MISTAKES IN MARCH AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY OF THE GOVERNOR OUR BUDGETS ANTICIPATED- REDUCTION WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO A WRITTEN OTHER RECESSION AND THAT'S THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH THAT THERE BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE. IS WE PAY DISTRIBUTORS. TWENTY FOUR MILLION A YEAR TO REAP TO K. RECYCLE HOW MANY CANS AND BOTTLES THEY'RE DELIVERING NOT SUPPORT BEING RECYCLED BUT THAT WAS THAT'S LIFE THAT HAPPENED APRIL MAY JUNE JULY ALL THREE TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN YOU CAN THEN IT GOT CONTINUED IN IT IN FEBRUARY MARCH AND APRIL AND MAY BEFORE WE DID THE BUDGET. BEFORE DOES THE BUDGET SO DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE PAYING TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT DATA. IT IN LIFETIME LIFETIME IT'SNOT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUAL IT'S NOT ESTIMATE IS NOT PROJECTION WE KNOW THAT IT IT'S AT THE STORE READY TO BE SOLD. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- D. B. BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FIND AND WHAT IS REPORTED IN THE BUDGET AND NOT THAT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND- TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR NUMBER AS YOU OUTLINED IN- AND- AT YOUR LETTER. THAT NUMBER IS PART OF THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OBVIOUSLY AND I EITHER WAY. I THINK I DID A REALLY. MEDIOCRE I WAS GONNA SAY BAD BUT I THINK I DID A REALLY MEDIOCRE JOB EXPLAINING THIS TO- THE CHRONICLE REPORTER BECAUSE LIVING AND BREATHING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR SO MANY YEARS. I REALLY I THINK ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THE WAY THAT OUR BUDGET WORKS IS THAT THAT NUMBER IS THAT BUDGET FIND. OUT THAT FUNDS- NUMBER IS FORMULA EIGHT FORMALIZED- FOR THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET AND THEN IT CARRIES OVER INTO THE BUDGET YEAR AND IS WHITE- AS WHAT. YOU ALL ARE WORKING OFF THAT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROJECTIONS IN SALES AND THE PROJECTIONS OF REDEMPTION- AND I THINK IT I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH WHAT I THAT ARE USEFUL WAS COVERING IS THIS ABSOLUTE ORIGINS. AND COMPARISON BETWEEN- THAT FUND STATEMENT THAT IN THE BUDGET AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT THAT REPORT IS NOT MEANT TO SHOW THE HEALTH OF THE FUNDS. THAT REPORT WAS CREATED VERY SPECIFICALLY AFTER THE LAST TIME WE WENT INTO PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GET AWARENESS SO TO PROVIDE ALL OF THESE PROJECTIONS AND WHAT WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE FIVE. I HONESTLY AND BECAUSE NONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF I CAN'T. THE END OF THE TABLE I DON'T THINK THAT THIS REPORT SERVES YOUR PURPOSES I THINK WHAT YOU JUST SAID THE VERY REAL TIME. INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS FUN AND WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS OUT IN THE WORLD AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED SERVES YOUR PURPOSE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE STATUTORILY REQUIRED IN THIS REPORT- AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. STATE AIRPORT WILL BE SOMETHING MORE USEFUL I'M GUESS I'M WONDERING FOR ANYBODY AT FINANCES. PAYING ATTENTION WHAT ARE WE DO GOING IN THE MAIL. YOU KNOW WE HAD MADE OF TO TWENTY WE KNEW THAT. ALL MY GOD WE THIS IS OF WORK OR DRINK AND THEY WERE THEIR DRINK AND OF BEER TO THEN WE HAD MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SEE THE NUMBERS ARE OFF THE CHARTS YOU'RE YOU'RE SHOWING ME. AND I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE IT WHAT HAPPENED WITH CURBSIDE DURING THIS WHEN PEOPLE WERE IF I GET THE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S SOMETIMES. THAT THOSE NUMBERS COMMANDED THAT CONTAMINATE CONTAMINATION RATE SHOOT THROUGH THE CEILING AND IT'S ALL IN THE LANDFILL AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT BUT NOW WE'RE COMING ON TIM MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE GOT PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FROM THE CHRONICLE BUT YOU'RE SAYING YOU. KNOW WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS IT. WHAT ARE YOU RELY ON IN AS- AND IF YOU DO HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY. NINE MILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENT PLANNING TO DO WITH THIS. COME THE MAY REVISE I GUESS THIS. IS YOU KNOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPROVE THE BOTTOM BILL PROGRAMMER WHAT'S UP. SERGIO YOU TAKE A QUICK SEVEN YOU HAVE BEEN WE WILL WANT TO WE WILL COME BACK WITH UPDATED NUMBERS FOR MAIN REVISED OUT OF THESE CONTINUE THESE TRENDS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- CONTINUE- IN TERMS OF SALES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THAT AS THE WORLD IS NOW STARTING TO OPEN UP- WHETHER WE WILL GO BACK TO. A MORE HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS AND ON. RECYCLING RATE TREND- BUT I DO WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I DO HEY WE ARE WORKING ON OUR WASTE CHARACTERIZATION RIGHT NOW I DON'T ANTICIPATE EVERYTHING'S GOING INTO THE LANDFILL AS YOU CAN SEE ARE THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS. ADDED THAT ARE BEING RECYCLED CONTINUES TO GO. SO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT- THAT DAY IF THE WHILE IT IS AND- THAT RATE TENDS TO BE. I HAVE A RING AROUND THAT 70% RATE RECYCLING RATE I WE ARE SEEING MORE CONTAINERS BECAUSE THE SALES NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP SO SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WE ARE ANTICIPATING COMING BACK TO YOU SENATOR WITH- HIGHER NUMBERS FOR THE FIND IN MAY REVISED WE'RE HERE I'LL TURN IT TO YOU WELL I GUESS. I GUESS. MR A- THANK YOU ARE WHAT. YOU KNOW WE GOT ALL OF LARGE RESERVE WHAT IS FINANCES OPINION ON WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HEALTHY AMOUNT. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE WHAT WHAT. AND WE'RE ONLY ONE OF TWO PUBLIC BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS A HEALTHY AMOUNT FOR THE RESERVE. L. WHAT'S A GIVE ME GIVE ME THE MINIMUM AND THE HEALTHY. YEAH THIRTY EITHER PART OF FINANCE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER AND IN TERMS OF WHAT. KIND OF HELP YOU FOUND. SB BRIDGES AT THE LIBRARY ON ODD RECORDS WAGNER'S COMMENTS BUT WE DO AGAIN YOU KNOW UPDATE OUR OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR MOST FUND BACK UNDER THE BUDGET ACT AND THAT MAY BE FIVE. AND WE HAD. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE I THINK IN IN THIS CASE WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE TREND THAT I THINK- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THAT HEARD WHAT WILL DEFINITELY. NOW WE HAVE TO DEBATE IT- STILL KIND OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHETHER THAT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR WILL CONTINUE. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE BALLOT THEY- THAT KIND OF BE YOU KNOW IF WE DO IT THROUGH MY HIGHER. LEVEL OF BRITAIN YOU KIND OF WHAT THAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THEN DEPENDING ON WHAT THE BALLOT ONE BALLOT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME POTENTIAL KIND OF OTHER STRATEGY THAT THOUGH- THAT DON'T YOU KNOW WE'RE DEFINITELY MONITORING BUT WILL DEFINITELY. I HAVE- WILL LOOK AT ANOTHER REVENUE- AT THE MEASURE FOR RUTHLESS. FOR THE REVISION. SO ARE THERE ARE VOWED TO READ MONCHI THERE OF WAYS TO MAKE THE RIVER. OF THAT NOW. IN ABOUT BILL. MORE ACCURATE AND MORE TIMELY YOU HAVE OTHER- OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU. SHARE WITH THE CAN TODAY. AT YOU MAY KNOW WE DO OUR PART I'M MORE- REAL TIME INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT WHAT'S BEING RECYCLED AND THOSE MONTHLY NUMBERS COME OUT- THANK YOU NOTE THAT IT. THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT IS VERY SPECIFICALLY BUILT OFF OF THOSE BUDGET NUMBERS AND- AND HAS STATUTORILY REQUIRED CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS THAT GO INTO IT SO. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU SENATOR AND TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT REPORT MORE USEFUL. DO YOU IN THE BUDGETING PROCESS TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE THINGS- IS IMPORTANT. IF WHAT TRULY THE BALL IS TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS FUND IS GOING TO PROVOKE INTO FOR PARTIAL REDUCTION. I'M HAPPY TO NOTIFY YOU. THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK A LOT OF CONFUSION HAS BEEN CREATED. BY THIS REPORT BECAUSE IT'S BUILT ON ONE MOMENT IN TIME- AND THEN IT IS A DIFFERENT MOMENT OF TIME THAT WE RELEASED THE BUDGET AND THEN A DIFFERENT MOMENT OF TIME THAT WE'RE- WE RELEASED. THE NAY REALIZE AND I THINK IT REALLY HAS. BRED A LOT OF CONFUSION AND IT IS ALL. PROJECTIONS AND- ECONOMIC. FORECASTING AND WHAT WE THINK CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO DO AND WHAT WE THINK THE PLASTICS MARKET OR THE ALUMINUM MARKET IS GOING TO DO AND CLEARLY THE PANDEMIC. SET EVERYTHING AS YOU- AND IN THE LAST. COUPLE OF YEARS IN TERMS OF THAT FORECASTING AND THAT AND THOSE AT PROJECTIONS AND ESTIMATES ETCETERA SO. I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THIS IS A VERY SMALL PIECE OF A LARGER CONVERSATION- BUT HOW DO WE GET THE LEGISLATURE. REAL TIME INFORMATION AT THAT CAN MAKE THE ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE AND THE I HAVE BUDGET APPROACH- AND THAT REALLY FACILITATES THE DECISIONS THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- ON AND IT- AT THIS YEAR I'M ON- I KNOW HOW CAN WE LOOK AT. THE RIGHT AMOUNT FOR A HEALTHY SURPLUS VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WELL YOU KNOW. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE AN OBLIGATION FINANCE YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE COULD NUMBERS SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN WE'RE SUPPOSED THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO HOLD YOU. FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AND IN THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW I MEAN WAS THE PUBLIC ABLE YOU KNOW. JUST A YEAR AGO I MEAN WE KNOW WE STARTED OFF IN JULY WITH THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS- SURPLUS THEN YOU ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS GONNA BE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IN A REPORT TO LEGISLATURE LAST FALL AND IN DECEMBER YOU SEND FINANCE A LETTER. THAT WAS FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THAT PROMPTED THE FIVE AND TWENTY NINE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THAT PROMPTED THE LETTER SAID SHE IS IN ONE YEAR MINNOWS ARE SORT OF. PRETTY BIG NUMBER SO LIKE ACT YOU KNOW. BY BOTH THE DAY. OF A HUNDRED MILLION IS SORT OF. THAT'S A LOT OF NICKELS AND DIMES. A LOT A LOT OF NICKELS AND DIMES AND- I KNOW EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHERE I AM ON. THE DESIRABILITY OF IMPROVING AND WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH THE NUMBERS CRUNCHES HERE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY IDEAS AT ITS- FINANCE OR THE MINISTRATION ON WHERE WE CAN CHANGE A PROGRAM IMPROVE IT BUT THAT. WE'RE JUST WE'RE JUST GETTING. WE'RE GETTING DATA HOW PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALIZE THE MISTAKE WAS MADE I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST I'M IN THIS GAME. ARE RECYCLING I THINK EVERYBODY ALL MY COLLEAGUES THINK IT IS I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. THIS WE WANT TO CALL OUR ACCOUNTING PROBLEM UNTIL I READ IT MOVE IN A COMICAL. I MEAN I WOULD TO NOTIFY. MY NOBODY WAS NOTIFIED. RIGHT AND AGAIN I WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON SOME CHANGES TO USE ACTUALLY THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT WOULD- PROVIDE MORE REAL TIME INFORMATION TO YOU AND TO THE PUBLIC. I DON'T I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO CALL IT A MISTAKE. AND SAY THAT ARE ESTIMATES AND ARE PROJECTIONS WERE WRONG IT'S I I'M NOT TRYING TO PARSE WORDS HERE. BUT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN DIDN'T HAPPEN. IS REALLY WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO AND WHILE THE NUMBERS IN THE BUDGET WERE BASED ON. BOOKS THAT WE HADN'T CLOSED YET AND THAT WAS REALLY THE ACCOUNTING ISSUE THAT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME AND AGAIN THIS DEPARTMENT WAS REALLY IMPACTED- IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO. CLOSE OUR BOOKS AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN TIME FOR THE JANUARY BUDGET- WE HAVE MADE AT THAT TIME WE ARE PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. O AND KEEPING YOU UP TO DATE WITH THESE NUMBERS AS WE HAVE NEW PROJECTIONS ARE NEW NEW INFORMATION. BUT REALLY AS WE'VE ILLUSTRATED HERE THE LAST TWO YEARS ARE UNPRECEDENTED IN HISTORICALLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN. EVER BEFORE AND SO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE OF ONE PERCENTAGE. THE R. V. N. OR C. R. V. OUT IS MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN A DAY. SO IT REALLY YOU'RE DEALING WITH AS YOU VERY VERY VERY WELL KNOW THOSE NICKELS AND DIMES ADD UP TO BILLION OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. I'M AND WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IS PROVIDING YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED SO THAT YOUCAN ADEQUATELY APPROPRIATE THIS MONEY- THAT KEEP THAT KEEP THE FIND HEALTHY SO. AGAIN WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU FOR MAY REVISE WITH UPDATED INFORMATION- AND AS YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS HAPPY ALWAYS HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT. THIS PROGRAM AND ANY OF OUR OTHER LIKE I GUESS IN JANUARY YOU CAME UP- OR THE GOOD. THE BUDGET SAYS THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. OUR A DEAF OR WE'RE GOING TO BE TOWARDS A I THINK A HUNDRED TO NINE THE I'M I'M SHUFFLING MY PAPERS RIGHT HERE HOW DO WE GET TO THAT NUMBER. MAYBE THE FINANCE NUMBER IF IT'S NOT IF IT IS DIRECTOR PLEASE. SO WE'RE NOT PROJECTING A DEFICIT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SURPLUS. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS BASED ON. OUR PROJECTIONS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING OUT OF THE FIND. VERSES THE AMOUNT OF SIERRA COMING IN. IT IS THAT THAT NUMBER IS BIGGER. BUT BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THE CHANGES IN THIS MARKET. OVER THE LAST. FIVE YEARS OR SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A SURPLUS AND IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO YOU HOW MANY BOTTLES AND CANS ARE BEING RECEIVED. AND I USE THAT MONEY GETTING OUT THE DOOR SO I DO THINK THAT THAT. BY THE END OF THIS THAT THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND WE WILL SEE THAT SURPLUS GO DOWN BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THAT TREND AROUND RECYCLING GO UP AGAIN- BUT- WE ARE. AT YEAH I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME COME IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND- TELL YOU I'M WORRIED ABOUT PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION IN THE NEXT YEAR SO WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT IN THE PLACE WHERE WE THINK. THAT THERE WILL BE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BECAUSE THE SURPLUS HAS ACCUMULATED. SO OKAY I'M LOOKING TO. RESTORE SOME FAITH AND FOLKS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PILOT PROGRAMS AND WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT IN A SECOND. BUT GENERALLY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH TALKED ABOUT DESERT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE UNDERSERVED WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE JUST STARTING TO GET IT WHAT HAS CHANGED WHAT WHAT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR HAVE CHANGED IF. PEOPLE ARE MAD ABOUT THE PANDEMIC% DERMATOPHYTE IN PLACE. AT ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT RUSSIANS INVADING YOU KERN WHAT MAKES THEM. THANK WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL FIFTY FIVE MILES TO RECYCLE THEIR BOTTLES I MEAN WHAT WHAT. WHAT IS NEW INFORMATION. FOR FRONT OF YOU THAT WOULD RESTORE THE FAITH. IN THE PUBLIC AT LARGE ARE YOU SEEING LESS PEOPLE DOING CURBSIDE IS THERE ANY DATA THAT'S COMING IN. THAT WOULD INDICATE. THAT IT'S WORKING. WELL I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW A RISK RATE THAN IT DOWN TO ROUGHLY SIX EIGHT PERCENT. HI IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT THAT WAS WITH MANY OF OUR RECYCLING CENTERS- CLOSED FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. AND MANY PEOPLE AREN'T NOT LEAVING THEIR HOMES WE WERE STILL RECYCLING AND 68% AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT JUMPED BACK UP TO OVER 70% I THINK FOR FIGURING IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND SEVENTY POINT SIX PERCENT- AS WE FINISH COMPILING THAT DATA FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS PEOPLE ARE STILL RECYCLING THAT THAT RECYCLING RATE OVERALL IS IT IS PRETTY AND- PRETTY STATIONARY THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE IMPROVING IT. I'M JUST SAYING 70% IS A PRETTY HIGH RECYCLING RATE FOR ANY PROGRAM MUCH LESS- AT ONE THAT IS- BRINGING IN. EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION BOTTLES AND CANS LAST YEAR THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER. I THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO I THINK. WE'RE SEEING THAT THAT THOSE REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES- NEED TO IMPROVE THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR STATE WHERE DOES THAT WHERE WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT RATE OF REDEMPTION. THAT YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AND- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THAT WE ARE SEEING THE AMOUNT OF RECYCLING GOING UP. I ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS AS A POSITIVE- AS YOU KNOW THE- REPLANTED PUBLISHERS HAD. A MAJOR IMPACT ON RECYCLING AND CONVENIENCE DON'T- AVAILABILITY I FEW YEARS BACK- BUT JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS- WE'VE I'M ON A BROAD ONLINE. THIRTY MORE RECYCLING CENTERS AND THAT'S DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THERE IS IMPROVEMENT AS IT IS HAPPENING BUT AS- AT AS AND YOU HIGHLIGHTED SENATOR. AND WE TALK ABOUT FOR A LOT OF YEARS THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM. A YEAH I GUESS SO WE HAVE THE LAW AUDIENCE. REPLAY CLOSE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR SITES IN TWENTY NINETEEN N. N. N. N. SO WE HAD ALMOST A FULL YEAR. OF NOT HAVING RE PLANET- WHEN WERE YOU GUYS ARE MAKING PROJECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT SO THAT SO WE KNEW THAT- N. AS- OKAY. ANOTHER I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ON THE PILOT PROGRAMS WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE TALKED ABOUT- THAT THE ARTICLE- HIGHLIGHTED ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF WANTED THE PROGRAM START WHEN DID THE MOBILE PROGRAM START THERE'S DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM- THE JULY FIRST ST WERE VERSUS THE ACTUAL DATE WHEN THE MOBILE PROGRAM- STARTED CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON ON THAT BECAUSE WHAT I AM WHERE I'M GOING FOR MY SECOND SHOULD SUPPLY THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING IS THAT WE KNOW THAT ALL THE OPTION BE PAYMENTS STOPPED. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE REPLACEMENT ON THE RECYCLING. WASN'T IN EFFECT. WELL AS YOU KNOW SENATOR- THAT BUDGET PASSED LAST YEAR SB ONE FIFTY FIVE- CONTAINED A PROVISION THAT- PROVIDED OUT FOR A YEAR- EIGHT AND- AT HIATUS FROM PAYING OPTION BE IF HE MET CERTAIN SMALL RETAILER OF REQUIREMENTS IN THIS WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE TECHNOLOG MEN OF THE HARDSHIP OF THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED WAR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO. IT MOST OPTION BE FOR THOSE SMALLER RETAILERS THE SMALL BUSINESSES- ARE NOT CURRENTLY I IN IN A FAX- AS FOR THIS ONE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME TO GIVE THEM TIME TO GET BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC I'M BUT YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO IS AS A AS AS I PUT IN MY RESPONSE SAN FRANCISCO'S. PILOT PROJECT HAS REDEEMED OVER TWENTY MILLION CONTAINER SINCE IT BEGAN IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I WILL GO TO SAY THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED THESE PILOT PROJECTS EARLIER BUT AGAIN MUCH LIKE STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE REALLY STRUGGLING DURING THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY THE EARLY PART OF PANDEMIC TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPERATE REMOTELY AND I THINK WE CAN ALL SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM- FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE INSTEAD OF THESE PILOT PROJECTS AND TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME- WITH THE PILOT PROJECTS IT'S- A PARTNERSHIP HAS TO BE BUILT BETWEEN RECYCLERS- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY- AND THE PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE. AT A CITING THE DROP OFF OR R. OR PICK UP- OPPORTUNITIES AND SO IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO FILL THESE OUT BUT SAN FRANCISCO SO FAR HAS- SENDS JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECYCLED MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION CONTAINERS- AND THEY ARE DOING AN INTERESTING I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THEIR PILOT PROJECT BECAUSE THEY'RE TESTING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES SO MOBILE RECYCLING WILL BE ONE OF THEM AS THEY'RE GETTING NOT ONLINE. AND THE BACKDROP AND. AND AS WELL AND THERE WILL BE INTRODUCING SOME REVERSE VENDING MACHINES I'M IN THE EARLY PART OF THIS. YEAR'S SO ON DECEMBER JUST GO IT WAS LITTLE I THE UPTAKE BUT ARE. TO SOME OF THEIR CHALLENGE AND A- I THINK- YOU KNOW NONE OF US PREDICTED A PANDEMIC AS WE ROLLED OUT THIS PROGRAM OR ANY OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS AND- ARE REALLY TRYING TO ADJUST TO GET THINGS BACK ONLINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT I. THINK MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY W. CAN PROBABLY SPEAK MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY TO THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT. I HAVE A QUICK QUICK QUESTION ON ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND ALUMINUM CANS I KNOW IT'S BECOMING POPULAR WHY NAY CAN BOOST IN THE CAN I CAN IS A CAN. YOU THINK. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED. I'M GLAD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW I WOULD ANSWER THAT IS THAT I IT WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE LEGISLATURE AT UNITED AND MATERIAL MATERIALIZE YOU SAID AGAIN AS I CAN- AND THAT YOU KNOW I WASN'T HERE WHEN THAT STATUTE FIRST OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT AND NINE PERCENT- FOR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM- BUT I'LL TELL YOU IT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE EASIER IF IT. I CAN WAS AGAIN. THE I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW. THE PEOPLE WILL. ALUMINUM IS GOING TO BE PROCESS JUST WHAT IS NOT COULD BE CV. GET THE DEPOSIT IT'LL JUST BE SCRAP METAL IS THAT BECOME. RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY AND SENATOR THE DEFICIT DOES NOT PERMIT US TO COLLECT THE SIERRA ME ON THOSE- BEVERAGE CONTAINERS- AND SO THEY- HAVE TO BE RECYCLED- AS AT AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW AND I'M I KNOW I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT I THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO- TAKE THIS PROGRAM AND OF ALL THAT INTO WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CIRCULAR ECONOMY- I WAS SAYING TO SOMEBODY THIS MORNING I WAS LOOKING AT THIS THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE THIS WHOLE BOOK RIGHT HERE THIS IS THE WHOLE STATUTE. AND THE STATUTE ALONE IS THE BOTTLE BILL VERSES ARE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE ORGANIC STATUTE WHICH IS I BELIEVE FIVE PARAGRAPHS THE STATUTE IS INCREDIBLY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE- AT WHAT WE COLLECT AND WHAT WE COLLECT ON AND HOW WE GET PAYMENTS AND ON WHAT SCHEDULE WE GET PAYMENTS. AND WE JUST REALLY AREN'T ADULTS YOU QUICKLY ADJUST TO THE CHANGING- STATE THAT WE ARE- YOU KNOW I KNOW NEW BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE COMING OUR NEW BEVERAGES ARE COMING ON THE MARKET ALL THE TIME. AND SOME OF THEM I HAVE THAT JUST ABOVE THAT ALCOHOL IS GREAT ART A PART OF OUR PROGRAM BUT I CAN'T. SUGGEST THAT ON THE- YEAH AT THE- WHEN. GOVERNOR NEWS FIRST TOOK OFFICE RECEIPT AS LOOK OUR LETTER X. SOME- BURNESS INTEREST IN FIXING THE PROBLEM AND WE KNOW THAT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION MADE EFFORTS AND EFFORTS AND EFFORTS TO NO AVAIL- I REQUEST THE LETTER S. THERE'S NO PROPOSALS OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANCE THE BROUGHT FORTH IN NOW THIS IS THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE ADMINISTRATION SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHY. OR OF WHAT HIS CHANGE WHAT WHY WHY NOT A SIGNIFICANT- ADDRESSING OF THE SERIOUSLY FALLS FLOOD- BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. WELL SENATOR I THINK THE WAY I WOULD ANSWER THAT IN AND WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE ARE THERE ISN'T THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF THIS PROGRAM CAN BE FIXED AND I THINK- I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR BUT FOR MYSELF NOW IN THIS CAPACITY AS THE DIRECTOR I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE HELP BUILD FOR HELPING BUILD OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND SO AS YOU KNOW HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO YOUR STAFF AS YOU- WORK THROUGH YOUR BILL I DO THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM WHO HAS A BILL WE PROVIDE HIM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL SO REALLY ENDS AND A REFLECTION OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF THIS PROGRAM WE WILL BE HERE TO SUPPORT THE POLICY DIRECTION THAT YOU LEGISLATE- AND PROVIDE YOU THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT- BUT WE REALLY WANT TO RESPECT THE FACT THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH- AND YOU ARE GOING TO DIRECT THIS POLICY AND HELP YOU. DO THAT TO THAT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. I WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM. AND WE DIDN'T GET IT DONE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE GOVERNOR IN AND WE HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS BEING PROVIDED THERE'S A CHALLENGE THERE'S A PHILOSOPHICAL CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ON IF WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO- HAVE OUR BETTER ANGELS TAKE IT TAKE CONTROL AND TRY TO GET SOMETHING FIXED IS GOING TO BE IS HI I APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE THAT YOU GIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AS I LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE SEEMS TO BE EVAPORATING WHERE HE JUST DECIDES I WANT TO DO IT THIS WAY BUT UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S DIFFERENCE TOWARDS THEM SO- WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO ASK I NEVER HEARD FROM FINANCE WHAT WAS THE MINIMUM OF THE RESERVE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT SHOULD BE IN THE ACCOUNT. I MISSED OUT ON THAT. YES SIR GENERAL PART OF FINANCE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC MINIMUM- YOU KNOW IT IT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PLANET I'LL GO I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY STILL KIND OF MONITORING THE HEALTH CONDITION OF FUND AND- LOOKING TO BE KIND OF WHAT THE TRENDS ARE GOING TO BE MOVING. THAT NOT THEY AT ME VISION THERE'S NO YEAH NUMBER THAT PER SE THAT WERE SAYING SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM OF THE DAY SO FINANCES AWARE WE TALK THIS FUND SOME LIKE IF DID IF YOU JUST LANDED FROM OUTER SPACE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS A GREAT THING SURPLUS FUND THESE ARE DEPOSITS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE PAID THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REDEEM. THEY THEY PAID THEIR NICHOLSON PAID THEIR TIME IN THE SYSTEM IS SO BROKEN BUT THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO NOW SOME PEOPLE FOR CONVENIENCE WOULD DO IT BUT MOST PEOPLE. YOU KNOW IF I REPEAT EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND PROBLEMS WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST THROW AWAY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AND DEPOSITS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO BACK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO TO THE STORE THEY CAN'T FIND A RECYCLING CENTER. THEY CAN'T THEY HAVEN'T FOUND ONE OF THESE THIRTY NEW PROGRAMS TO THE COME ON BOARD TO JUST REACH REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THIS IS THE CONSUMERS MONEY THAT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING OF IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY I GUESS BECAUSE WE GOT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IT HASN'T BEEN RETAINED. THAT HAS REDUCED ME THAT WE SHOULD IT WITH IT WE WOULD IN THE BEST CAUGHT POSSIBLE WORLD WOULD ALWAYS BE ZERO EVERYBODY WHO SPENT A NICKEL GOT TO NICKELBACK RIGHT AND WE WILL BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HATE. HOW WE PAY FOR. THE STAFF POSITIONS ARE- ALL RIGHT A- WE WILL. CLOSE THE CLOSE THE RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA HAVE PEOPLE FROM POP THAT HAVE- INFORMATION- FIVE. AM LOOKING FORWARD WITH GREAT INTEREST TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE MINISTRATIONS ATTENTION TO THIS AREA IN THE MAY REVISE WE MAY HAS MAP- DIRECTOR MONCHI WHETHER WE MAY HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN BEFORE THAT- BECAUSE AS YOU AS YOU. INTIMATED WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION LIVE ON THIS AND I JUST- I'M PERFECT THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY IN THE FUND AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IT. THEN OR WE DO WORK WE TRY TO MINIMIZE IT AND WE NEED TO DO WE THE PUBLIC DEMANDS BETTER PERFORMANCE FROM THIS PROGRAM OR GET A DIFFERENT PROGRAM. AND THIS ALL ALL LEAVE IT AT THAT APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY. AND WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS C. WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE TAX FUND THIS IS SB. FOUR FIFTY SIX WE HAVE THE- NATURAL RESOURCES A- THIS ORDER TO CREATE AN ACTION PLAN. THE TASK FORCE SORRY IT'S- BUT EVERYBODY IS SLEEP HERE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. THE NATURAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY BEFORE US. OKAY YES THIS IS A GREAT TIME- DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE FORCED RESILIENCE TASK FORCE I AM I AM ON MUTED BUT MY VIDEO IS NOT. WORKING THERE'S A. IT'S BEING CONTROLLED CENTRALLY OR NOT. WELL. I MAY HAVE TO GO OUT AND COME BACK IN. WITH YOU A QUESTION AND- I THINK AT THE. WE CENTER STERN REYES TO CAUSE CONCERN ABOUT THE PATTERN TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT WE UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT WITH THE RESOURCES- DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT ITEM. YEAH. YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT I HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THIS IS PATRICK RIGHT TIME- DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S. A FORCES ELISE JASPER'S HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY OF MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WHAT I WOULD THOUGHT I WOULD DO CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE AND I CAN SEE A- THERE. WHEN I THOUGHT I WOULD DO- JUST VERY BRIEFLY BEFORE WE GET TO YOUR QUESTIONS IT IS JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE'D COME- I OBVIOUSLY DON'T NEED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FOREST AND WILDFIRE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING- MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN VERY ELOQUENT ON THAT AT THE HEART OF WORK ON THAT- OUR JOB AT THE TASK FORCE WAS TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE. PLAN AND STRATEGY WHICH WE DID IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE TO PULL TOGETHER ALL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VARIOUS STATE FEDERAL AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM FROM. JILL FRIEDMAN PROJECTS TO WOULD UTILIZATION TO PRESCRIBE FIRE CETERA. WE LAID OUT THAT PLAN IT WAS REALLY MEANT TO. BOTH GUIDE THE EXPENDITURES OF ORIGINALLY A BILLION AND A HALF STAND AND MORE EXPENDITURES ON. VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM TO ALIGN THE AGENCIES GET THEM OUT OF THEIR SILOS AND GET THEM. WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATING COST SHARING. AND THE PLAN ALSO INCLUDES A SPECIFIC LIST OF. I'M NINETY NINE ACTIONS THAT WE ARE TRACKING ON A REGULAR BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON TRACK AND RUN TIME WITH DELIVERING. ON THOSE ACTIONS MANY OF WHICH WRONG FROM SPECIFIC LGISLATIVE MANDATES. WE THEN RELAUNCH THE TASK FORCE LAST SUMMER- TO BE HONEST STATE LEADERSHIP TO INCLUDE FEDERAL LEADERS LOCAL LEADERS. TRIBAL LEADERS A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS. BEGAN WITH THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF. OF AND MONITORING AND EVALUATING THE NINETY NINE ACTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALIGNMENT. AND ALSO TO SCALE UP OUR EFFORTS AS AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A- A MILLION ACRE TARGET BETWEEN FEDERAL AND NON FEDERAL LAND- THAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO TRY TO GET THERE. I TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS PART OF A ROAD MAP INJECTION THREE BIG BUCKETS. AND ONE IS A SERIES OF STATEWIDE STRATEGIES FOR THINGS LIKE REFORESTATION PRESCRIBED FIRE WOULD YOU LOSE ASIAN PRIVATE LANDOWNER ASSISTANCE TO MAKE SURE. AGENCIES ARE COORDINATING AND MOVING FORWARD IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS. SECOND A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING SYSTEM. SO THAT YOU AND OTHERS CAN BE AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE ACCOMPLISHING ON THE GROUND. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ALL THE AGENCIES ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE ACRES TREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY. WE'RE TRYING TO ALLOW ACT COME UP WITH ONE CONSISTENT SYSTEM. AND ALSO GO BEYOND ACRES TREES AND BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ACHIEVING IN TERMS OF. RESILIENCE CARBON STORAGE YOU KNOW EFFECTIVENESS AT CETERA. AND THEN FINALLY AND I THINK- OKAY PERHAPS MOST IN THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMITTEE IN OTHER. IS BILL A REAL FOR AND WE'RE GONNA TO GET THE DONE. I KNOW IT'S A LONG STANDING CONCERN OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE RISKS AND PRIORITIES IN EACH REGION ARE VERY DIFFERENT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A FIVE POINT STRATEGY TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THAT WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF REGIONAL FORUMS WERE MEETING REGULARLY WITH THE LEADERS IN EACH REGION. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN. HELP THEM ADDRESS THEM SECOND A SET OF REGIONAL PROFILES ARE SCIENCE DRIVEN. THAT RECOGNIZE WITH THE KEY RISKS AND PRIORITIES ARE IN EACH REGION. THIRD THROUGH THE R. F. YOU PROGRAM THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM BUT THE LEGISLATURE. CODIFIED LAST YEAR TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF REGIONAL PROJECTS THAT REFLECT AGAIN THE PRIORITIES AND RISK IN EACH REGION AND TO FUND THOSE THROUGH A NEW CONCEPT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO PILE IT WHICH IS REGIONAL BLOCK GRANTS TO BE ABLE TO SEND TO THESE REGIONAL EFFORTS BLOCK GRANTS. TO COVER A WIDE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN FINALLY DESERVES A REGIONAL TOOL KITS RECOGNIZING THAT SOME REGIONS ARE WAY AHEAD SUMMER BEHIND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY REGION HAS THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY THE LATEST TOOLS THEY NEED TO PLAN PRIORITIZE AND GET PROJECTS DONE. OF COURSE DOING ALL THAT DOES TAKE RESOURCES ARE WE ARE TRYING TO STAY LEAN AND MEAN THAT THE TASK FORCE ITSELF WHERE RELYING ON THE LEADERSHIP OF. THE CALIFORNIA OR THE FOR SERVICE IN OTHES BUT WE DO HAVE A HANDFUL OF POSITIONS THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO RUN THE OPERATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE INCLUDING A COUPLE POSITIONS AT C. N. R. A. A COUPLE WITH CAL FIRE. I IN SOME CONSULTANTS SUPPORT TO KEEP US MOVING SO WE HOPE YOU'LL LOOK FAVORABLY UPON THAT- AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH ARE WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC. ON FIRST AND FOREMOST OF COURSE WAS. AGREEMENT ON THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE LAST YEAR I'M CERTAINLY HOPEFUL HAVE AGREEMENT THIS YEAR ON A PACKAGE OF. A SIMILAR MAGNITUDE- AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF BILLS THAT PASSED LAST YEAR FALL ONE THAT CODIFIED THE TASK FORCE ACTION PLAN SEVERAL AND PRESCRIBED FIRE LIABILITY EACH ONE THAT CODIFIED THE REGIONAL BUYER AND FORCE CAPACITY PROGRAM. EACH OF THOSE BILLS. HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR ABILITY TO GET THINGS DONE ON THE GROUND- INTO A LINE THE AGENCIES IN SUPPORT OF OUR GOALS SO CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND- AFTER TALKING MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. BY ANY ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM YOU MIGHT ANTICIPATE SOME LEGISLATIVE OF MORE AND LEGISLATIVE AMBITION THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN JANUARY BUT I DON'T WANNA GET AHEAD OF MYSELF. ALLEY MISS KIRSTEN- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS- BUDGET REQUEST. I DIDN'T CARE. AND SENATOR TELLING YOU WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON WE HAVE AN IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. CENTER STERN OF QUESTION. YES THANK YOU MR- AND- THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT FOR- PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER AND- REALLY TRYING TO THINK COMPREHENSIVELY- ABOUT OUR STRATEGY I KNOW WE WENT THROUGH SOME OF THIS- THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS LAST YEAR NOW WE SORT OF WE'RE SITTING HERE. AT THE BUDGET PHASE OF IMPLEMENTATION- AND WHILE WE WERE DEVELOPING POLICY LAST YEAR ON THIS TOPIC OF CODIFYING THE ACTION PLAN- I HAD RAISED. THE QUESTION ABOUT HAVING MORE QUANTIFIABLE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AROUND- THE HARDENING- IN DEFENSIBLE SPACE PRONG OF THE STRATEGY- AND I'M JUST WONDERING I KNOW THERE WAS SOME RESISTANCE TO PUTTING ANYTHING QUANTIFIABLE THAT WOULD BE SOME KIND OF ANALOG TO. THE ACREAGE TARGETS WHICH SEEM TO BE A CENTRAL METRIC AND YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HEAR ANY MENTION ACTUALLY IN YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT ANY OF THE HOME HARDENING OUR COMMUNITY HARDENING OR DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORKING. SEEMS LIKE THE BUDGET KIND OF REFLECTS THAT- THAT PRIORITY IN IN THE- CURRENT ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO- THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS BUT I'M I'M WONDERING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT- APARTMENT INSURANCE APPARENTLY HAS. A NEW PROPOSAL THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH CAL FIRE AND- YES HAVE YOU ALL- STARTED TO DEVELOP SOME PER PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT THAT YOU INTEND TO. TO HELP DRIVE- THAT PRONG OF THE STRATEGY. YES WE DO WE HAVE AN EFFORT UNDERWAY WE'VE GOT A FIRE ADAPTED COMMUNITIES WORK GROUP THAT INCLUDES THE- LEADERSHIP OF- FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND KEY INTEREST GROUPS TO TRY TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON. HOW DO YOU EVALUATE COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY WHAT'S WORKING AND NOT WORKING AND WHAT HE IS- A COMMUNITY THAT'S WELL PROTECTED HOW DO YOU DEFINE THAT OTHER A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEASURES OBVIOUSLY AS YOU MENTIONED YOURSELF. A PERCENTAGE OF- RESIDENCES AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE HOME HARDENING THAT HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE DO THEY HAVE EVACUATION ROUTES. DO THEY HAVE OUT OF REACH- THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF RAZORS OUT THERE ON THE DATE MOST OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON GETTING THOSE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMMES UNDERWAY- BUT I'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF TRYING TO THEN ROLL THOSE UP AND BE ABLE TO TELL YOU AND OTHERS HOW MUCH PROGRESS ARE WE MAKING IN MAKING COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE IN COMING UP WITH A SINGLE DEFINITION OF WHAT MAKES A COMMUNITY RESILIENCE- BUT THERE IS AN EFFORT UNDERWAY JUST TO ESTABLISH A SET OF INDICATORS THAT WILL DO THAT. CERTAINLY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH A WITH A MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN IN IN TERMS OF THE REGIONAL FORUMS THAT THAT YOU. DESCRIBED AT THE OUTSET- DO YOU THINK THAT'S THAT THAT FINING THOSE SORT OF. MEASURES ARE THE PART. PART OF THE WILDFIRE STRATEGIES GOING TO BE A- FOCAL POINT CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE MORE COLOR ON WHATWHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT AROUND THESE THE REGIONAL FORMS YOU DESCRIBE- YEAH I KNOW I DO THINK THE REGIONAL FORMS ARE GOING TO BE THE CIVIC CREASING LEE THE CENTRAL WAY WHERE WE GET THINGS DONE. I THINK FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WE'RE HEARING THIS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE GOT A LOCAL COMMUNITIES LOCAL RCTS FIRE DISTRICTS SAYING. IF WE HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANTS WE CANNOT. SUSTAIN PROJECT YOU CAN'T RAMP UP AFTER GETTING A GRANTED RAMP DOWN HOPE YOU MIGHT GET A GRANT FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECT TWO YEARS FROM NOW OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. WE NEED TO MOVE COLLECTIVELY TOWARDS SUSTAIN FINDING OF THESE REGIONAL PLANTS. YEAH I'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO IN YOU KNOW A SITUATION WHERE BUDGETS ARE ANNUAL. SO WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A WAY SO THAT WE CAN BLAND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THESE. YOU KNOW ONE TIME. ASIANS OF MONEY WERE GAY. THROUGH GRANTS TO AGENCIES SO THEY'VE GOT SEVERAL YEARS OF MONEY OVER TIME TO GET BLOCKS OF PROJECTS DONE SO THAT THEY CAN HIRE THE CONTRACTORS THE CONSULTANTS THE CREWS. ARE VERY HARD TO DO WHEN YOUR- YOUR FUNDING STRATEGY IN YOUR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY YOU KNOW IS BASED ON A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. YOU'LL GET A COMPETITIVE GRANT OR NOT- THERE'S A LONG STANDING HISTORY THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA- GOING THE COMPETITIVE GROUP ROUTE TO MAKE SURE THE BEST PROJECTS GET FUNDED SO WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A BLEND OVER TIME WE'RE INCREASINGLY AS REGION'S DEMONSTRATE TO ALSO THEY'VE GOT SOLID PLANS. THAT HAVE BROAD BASED SUPPORT THEIR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND MONITORING THAT ONCE THEY CAN MEET THAT TEST AND HAVE A SOLID PLAN INCREASINGLY I HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARDS BLOCK GRANTS TO THOSE ENTITIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE DECIDING WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE IN THEIR REGION. RATHER THAN FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO. AND MUSIC TO MY EARS IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO GET AROUND THIS SORT OF SPORADIC CYCLE ESPECIALLY AS YOU'RE DOING CAPACITY BUILDING IN AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH- BUT ON THAT NOTE I. I RECALL THAT WE DO HAVE A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION I THINK FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND ON AT LEAST SOME ASPECT OF OUR OF OUR WILDFIRE. MITIGATION STRATEGY IS THAT HOW HOW MIGHT YOUR TASK FORCE BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE- SOME PRIORITY SAY. FOR THOSE KINDS OF ON GOING STREAMS- THAT THAT KIND OF ON GOING SCREENING TO PROVIDE THIS KIND OF. OR CAPACITY ASSISTANCE IS THAT IS THAT ON THE TABLE. THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK AS WE MOVE TO DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT FOR BLOCK GRANTS WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE TO FIGURE OUT. SOME FUNDING STREAMS FROM BOTH THE STATE SIDE IN THE FEDERAL SIDE LEND THEMSELVES TO LONGER TERM TIME HORIZONS AND OTHERS DON'T OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE A NEED FOR A ONE TIME MONEY FOR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS TO GO AND GET THINGS DONE. AND THEN WE HAVE A KNEE NEED ALSO FOR SUSTAIN PROGRESS SO WE'LL DEFINITELY BE WORKING WITH THE WITH FINANCING ADMINISTRATION AND LED STAFF TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MATCH. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FUNDING WITH DIFFERENT PURPOSES. SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP OFFLINE ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN HELP- ON CORONATION ON SOME OF THE REGIONAL SCALE I WANT TO SEE. THIS THIS INSURANCE REGULATORY APPROACH IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REQUIRE GENERAL FUND OR EVEN G. G. R. F. TO HELP BE A DRIVER TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK SO WE DON'T JUST PRICE EVERYBODY OUT OF THE FIRE ZONES BUT I. I'M REALLY LOOKING ALSO TO YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR A LITTLE MORE CLARITY IN THIS TASK FORCE'S STRATEGY AROUND. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT INTO THE FIRE CELLS WE KNOW THERE'S FUNDING IN THE BUDGET TO DO INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND NOT FIRE DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE'S ALSO. BOARD OF FORESTRY REGULATIONS THAT. HAVE RAISED SOME HACKLES ABOUT ARE WE ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZING NEW DEVELOPMENT THERE I'D LOVE TO SEE IN FOLLOW UP IN A DRESSED IN THE STRATEGY YOU BRING BACK THE LEGISLATURE. HOW TO ACTUALLY MITIGATE RISK. BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT AND NEW HIGH RES DEVELOPMENT WE PUT INTO THOSE ZONES AND WHAT THAT'LL YOU'LL TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU. I THINK VERY GOOD WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- AND MOVE ON TO- RIGHT SIZING OUR FIRE CREWS WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS- THIS IS ISSUED NUMBERS. A DIRT HAS COULD MORE. WELCOME TELL US ABOUT RIGHT SIZE YOUR FIRE CREWS COMMITTEE BY- CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS BOTH- ONE WAY AND I'M AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- ARE TO BY TWENTY TWO TWENTY. RIGHT GENERAL FUND OF JUST ORDER ALLOWING STAFF POSITION AND THEIR FOR TIME FORMER BUSINESS SOME IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT I CAN'T BACK TO CALIFORNIA DROUGHT. WE HAVE NO ARE. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN GATHERED TO FIRE IN WITH CAL OR OTHER- OKAY A FIRE SENT. A MEANS IN YEARS BAD- CREWS THAT- CAN PLASTER THE ROLE ARTURO LOS WATER CENTERED JOB ON WALL STREET SO. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE FOUR EIGHT PER FIREFIGHTING. WITH THE YOU MORE CRUZ YOU TO MORE YOU HIGHER RISK OUT OF COUNCIL- EARLIER THE OR THIS- ARE. ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN HEARD YEAH SO TWENTY TWO TO THREE YEARS EVEN MORE FIRE CREWS WILL CHAD ADDITIONAL TEN PERMANENT PART- AND IF THE INSURING YOUR SO THERE'S A GREAT FOR. THE STAFF SIDE. I'M HERE TO GO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU MIGHT HAVE. MISTER SEA FROM THE ALSO HE HAD ANY- OF. ON LOW LOS PETER CENTER CAMERA THIS CENTER MY- TO HEADQUARTERS. I'M SPECIFIC CONCERNS THE PROPOSED WE DO THINK IT PROBABLY MAY SENSE SAID PROVIDE TO ME JUST RESOURCES IN THIS AREA MORE J. AND WE DIDN'T IT'S IMPORTANT KIND OF LOOK AT THIS PROPOSED PROBABLY IN A OF ALL OF THE OTHER DARK. THAT YOUR STAY WE- I KNOW WE A WHOLE HERE READ ABOUT A PROPOSAL AND EVERYTHING IT'S IMPORT LOOK AT BUT- WE DO THINK THAT A THESE CREWS PROVIDE A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR THE STATE AND- GIVEN THAT IT IN CREATE- YOU KNOW TEMP TO MAKE SURE THE THESE ARE. WELL AND- YOU CAN CAN AT LEAST THE STATE. MISTER BENSON WITH THE- OF FOR. OUR STAFF RECOMMENDED. IS TO PROVE HIS BUT- MISTER. SUBMITTED. OKAY SORRY NOTHING BAD YEAH I KNOW I WAS YEAH I KNOW I'D HEY WE THINK THIS IS ARE ALWAYS A VERY IMPORTANT FULL JUST TO KIND OF MAINTAIN EXISTING FIRE THE PAST YEAR OR SO DONE NOTHING REALLY TO THE PRESENTATION- AND LATER. COVERED IT WELL HI. DOCTOR SAID A WEEK TO THE VOTE. OUR PORTION WILL UC. A CONSIDER MOTION TO APPROVE IT- REQUEST. THEY YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR THE SPRING CAL. ISSUE THE SEVEN THESE. ARE BAD. FOR THE LIVESTOCK- IT'S LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS MANAGERIAL EMPLOYEES. MR HENNING WELCOME. THANK YOU SURE WHY CALCIUM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I NEVER HAVE NAMED ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STATE FIRE TRAINING WITH CAL FIRE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. THIS GOVERNOR OFFICE PROPOSAL IS FOR FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND IN BUDGET YEAR IN A HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND ONE POSITION TO IMPLEMENT TRAINING FOR THE LIVESTOCK HOUSE PROGRAM. BASED ON PREVIOUS ENQUIRIES FROM THIS COMMITTEE INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE- CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION WE LOOK AT HOW WE SCOPE THE ORIGINAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN OH THREE. REGIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AVE LOOKED AT DELIVERING THE COURSES USING AN ONLINE COURSE DELIVERY FORMAT. THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IS THAT THE END USERS PREFER DC BASED COURSE FOR DELIVERY BY TRANSITIONING TO A SEA BASED COURSE. WE HAVE REVISED THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE POSITION AND REDUCE THE COST TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. YOU'RE STILL REQUESTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THE IMPLEMENTATION TO JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS SIX MONTH EXTENSION IS FOR THE COURSE PLAN TO GO THROUGH THE STATE WIDE TRAINING EDUCATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND THE STATE BOARD OF FIRE SERVICES APPROVAL PROCESS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. MISS SINCE ALLEY- HAVE A COMMENT. I'M SO WE RECENTLY- HEARD ABOUT THE INSTRUCTIONS CHANGE OF PLANS WITH REGARD TO THIS PROPOSAL AND HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO DIG INTO THE SPECIFICS HOWEVER AND I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER BUT IF THEY DO WANT THIS IN PERSON OR- THE ONLINE COURSE. WHICH MODEL THEY WANT TO CHOOSE BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO DEPEND THAT'S GONNA- THAT'S GOING TO INFORM THE RESOURCES THAT ARE REQUIRED SO- WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY REASONABLE TO CONSIDER BOTH OPTIONS AND- JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED ARE REALLY COMMENSURATE WITH THAT YEAH. HALF A MILLION BUCKS SIXTY THOUSAND YOU KNOW THERE'S A- THE PUBLIC EXPECTS SOMETHING ALL RIGHT- WE'RE GONNA HOLD MATTER OPEN. CAN YOU GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ON THE ONLINE. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WE GET TO. MAY WE KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU CAL FIRE LET'S MOVE ON TO DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE IN. CRAB TRAPS THIS IS COMMERCIAL FISHING INSPECTIONS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. DIRECTOR BONNIE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE. LIKE THE PRIOR ISSUE THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS HALF A MILLION BUCKS AND THE PUBLIC CAN EXPECT SOMETHING- THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ON ISSUE EIGHT IN MY VIEW IS A CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND ECONOMIC STABILITY PROPOSAL. THE DEPARTMENT SIX FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND AND THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT SENATE BILL EIGHTY. THAT BILL GIVES OUR DEPARTMENT- THE INSTRUCTION THE AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT WHAT'S CALLED AN OF DISSERTATION PROGRAM FOR OUR COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS AND ROCK CRAB FISHERIES EXPAND OUR BIO TOXINS SAMPLING. IN OUR CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND CREATE BETTER CONSISTENCY FOR OUR HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE OCEAN YOU ARE CATCHING THESE CROWDS AROUND SOME OF THE OPENING CRITERIA BEGINNING OF EACH SEASON. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL HELP WE HAVE BROAD SCALE KIND OF OR DESTABILIZATION CHALLENGES. ARE MORE IN REGIONAL COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST REALLY STRUGGLING. AS CLIMATE CHANGE THAT AFFECTING OUR OCEAN THAT WILL HELP US KEEP GOOD CLEAN SEAFOOD. ON THE PLATES OF CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. LET ME PAUSE THERE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME. LET'S A CHECK IN WITH THE- THE L. A. YOU'LL MISS A SELLERS YOU HAVE ANY- VIEWS ON UNHEALTHY LEVERAGE LEVELS OF THE MULTI CAST SAID OR OTHERS ALL THINGS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM. HI I THINK YOU MISTER TO A LIST OF THE WAY- I AM AGAINST UNHEALTHY LEVELS STOCKS. WE DIDN'T ANY CONCERN WITH THIS PROPOSAL YOU. OUR LET'S THAT WE HAVE SET MCGUIRE HAS QUITE PLEASE GO AHEAD CENTERS DIESEL RESEARCHER IN THE JOY. NOTICES THEY A CONCERN WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FLEET ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE HAD. IN ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS NOTED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN- THE STAFF REPORT. EVERY YEAR THEY A CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE COPPER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. EXPECTS CRABBERS THE FLEET OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART THE SCHLEP OUT. THROW SOME TRAPS IN THE OCEAN CAPTION CRAB BRING IT BACK AND THEN PROVIDED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR TESTING. OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE SEEM SEASONS CANCEL SEASON SIGNIFICAN DELAYED. AND THE FLEET HAS TO CONTINUE. TO DO THIS WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF COMPENSATION IT'S PRETTY RIDICULOUS. I SENT A MILLION DOLLARS- THIS STATE SHOULD BE COMPENSATING CRAB FISHERMEN FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IF THE STATE EMPLOYEE WERE TO DO THAT IT WOULD COST- SIGNIFICAN DOLLARS IF WE WERE TO CONTRACT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT YET THERE'S BEEN THIS. EXPECTATION SINCE BEARS AROUND IN THIS STATE THAT THE FLEET IS GOING TO DO IT AND SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE SEASONS SO- I KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR IS VERY WELL AWARE OF THIS- WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE TO WORK THIS OUT. BEFORE THAT- THE BUDGET IS ADOPTED IN AGAIN IT'S LESS THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE BILL TO COMPENSATE THOSE FISHERMEN WHO HAPPENED TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND CATCH THIS CRAP AND THEN TURN IT INTO A STATE AGENCY TO FILL A FLIPPIN MANDATE THAT THE STATE HAS ON THE FLEET. SO AT THAT IS JUST MY ONE CRUNCHY PIECE- THAT I WANTED VETO DANCE DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE THEIR STAFF FOR CONDITIONS TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN WE DID HAVE SOME CONCERN OBVIOUSLY WHEN I HAVE A HAPPY OUTCOME I THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO THE- WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY. ACTIONS THIS IS THE SB SEVEN NINETY PROPOSAL- YES SURE. SO LIKE THE PRIORITY ISSUE WHERE THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL IS IN YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE THE SAME IS TRUE ON THIS ISSUE- I ACTUALLY WE RE NOTICE THIS AND WE'VE TAKEN THIS OFF THE CALENDAR I FORGOT. I HAVE MY FINAL PAPER HERE SO- WE WILL COME BACK AND VISIT THIS IS A DIFFERENT AT A DIFFERENT DATE- OKAY BECAUSE WE GOT SOME CHANGES SO. SORRY ABOUT THAT- IT'S OKAY WE'RE DONE WITH YOU FLORIDA. WE DON'T WILDLIFE FOR THE MOMENT THEY WILL GO- TO THE PARKS AND RECREATION AND ISHQ- OUR NEXT NEXT ISSUE ON BONDS IN TECHNICAL PROPOSALS. PROP. SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. MR DOING. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BRUCE- MY NAME IS BRIAN DELEON THE CHIEF OF THE SOLE REASON THE BELLMAN FOR STATE PARKS AND I'LL BE PRESENTING THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ISSUE I'D LIKE TO FIRST START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'VE HAD SOME BIG DIFFICULT EXPLAINING THISISSUE CLEARLY THUS FAR SO PLAY COULD NOT RECTIFY THAT TODAY THE ISSUE BASICALLY HAS TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART IS LARGELY TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND IS RELATED TO HOW VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS AND DECISIONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY SAVINGS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THE SECOND PART OF THIS ISSUE IS MORE OF A POLICY QUESTION REGARDING THE BEST USE OF THESE LIMITED FINANCE ADMINISTRATION ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO USE THESE FUNDS. TO COMPLETE- CONTINUE CAP CONTINUING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS IN LIEU OF STARTING ONE OR MORE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS- THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS SIGNIFICANT NEEDS OF BOTH EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE FIRST PART OF THIS AND DESCRIBE SOME OF THESE CHANGES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THEY'RE VERY BEEN VERY IS APPROPRIATIONS REVISIONS FUND CHEFS THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE AMOUNT OF PROP SIXTY FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND AS OF THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY THE NET RESULT OF THESE CHANGES PROVIDE A TOTAL OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FROM PROP. SIXTY EIGHT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. BEN AND ENJOY TWENTY ONE. THE BUDGET ACT ADDITIONAL ONE UNDER EIGHTY FIVE GENERAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. WE SUBMITTED A LIST OF THESE PLANNED PROJECTS INTO THE LEGISLATURE IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE MAKING. CLEAR THAT THIS LIST WILL NOT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS PROPOSAL. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS PROPOSED BUDGET ACT INCLUDES- THIS PCP THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY FOR REVERSION OF ROUGHLY FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PROP SIXTY EIGHT SAVINGS- THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF A PORTION OF THE ONE EIGHTIES HARRY FIVE NINE GENERAL FUND PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT ABLE TO DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROJECTS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO FULLY FUND SEVERAL PARTIALLY FUNDED AND UNDERFUND UNDERFUNDED PROJECTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE SHIFTING FUNDING FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ONLY PARTIALLY FUNDED FOR THE FACE FIRST PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION SUCH AS THE PIGEON POINT LIGHTHOUSE. WHICH WAS ONLY FUNDED FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THE TOP SECTION OF THE WHITE HOUSE. BY SHIFTING FUNDING TO THE GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PROJECT THE PARTS WAS ABLE TO FULLY FUND. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE LIGHTHOUSE. SOME OF THE SAVINGS GENERATED BY THE FUND SHIFT ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASEPROP SIXTEEN FUNDING FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS. SUCH AS THE MOUNT DIABLO ROAD REPAIR PROJECTS WHEREBY FUNDING WAS INCREASED BY THREE POINT THREE MILLION TO EIGHT MILLION. TO EXPAND PHASE ONE OF THE- ROAD REPAIR PROJECT. IN ADDITION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PARKS IS ABLE TO MEET THE REGIONAL TARGET SPECIFIED IN THE BOND ACT PARKS AND SET ASIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT. ROUGHLY THREE MILLION OF THESE FUNDS SET ASIDE WERE ULTIMATELY NOT NEEDED GIVEN PARKS IS PROJECTED TO MEET REGIONAL TARGETS BASED ON PROJECTS IDENTIFIED TO DATE. FINALLY THE OTHER PROP SIXTY SAVINGS WERE GENERATED ON THE NATURAL AS ACTUAL COSTS WERE LOWER THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. AND THIS IS SPREAD OVER ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE THE SAVINGS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT NOT BEING VIABLE AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS. SO THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN THESE SAVINGS OF ROUGHLY FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION APPROX SIXTY EIGHT. SO THIS BRINGS US TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS ISSUE AND THE UNDERLYING QUESTION THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY IS RATHER THAN SHIFTING PROP SIXTY FUNDING. ARTIST CAPITAL CAPITAL OUTLAY WHY NOT START NEW DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WITH THE FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS YOU KNOW ALL STATE PARKS AS A SEPARATE SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AND WE COULD HAVE STARTED ONE OF MORE PROJECTS WITH THE STAVING DESCRIBED. FIRST TO DETERMINE THAT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT TO RESERVE THESE FUNDS IN THE NEAR TERM TO COVER INCREASED COSTS ON EXISTING PROJECTS. S. A PARTIAL RESTRAINING THESE FUNDS ON NEW PROJECTS AND THEN FAILED TO SECURE THE NATIONAL CAPITAL THE FUNDING NEEDED. STATE PARKS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF HAVING TO STOP OR REDUCE CONTINUING CAPITAL IT PROJECTS. TO STAY WITHIN AVAILABLE FUNDING. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECOMING AVAILABLE THAT TIME. THIS STRATEGY WAS INTENDED TO HELP ENSURE THE COMPLETION OF EXISTING PROJECTS. BUT ALSO PRESERVING THE OPPORTUNITY SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND START MORE PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. SO WITH THAT I CAN CLEAR MY AT MY PRESENTATION AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MR SINGH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REVERT ROUGHLY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT FOR ITS ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. BASICALLY BY DIVERTING THESE BOND FUNDS THE DEPARTMENT WOULD MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO COVER COST INCREASES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED RELATED TO SOME OF ITS CAPITAL PROJECTS- I HEARD ABOUT THAT AS WELL WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THIS CAP OUT LIKE PROJECTS AND WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO BACK FIELD TO THESE FINDS THE NET EFFECT REALLY- AT THIS PROPOSAL IS BACK. AND THEY WOULD BE LESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT- COMPARED TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND WE DO KNOW THE DEPARTMENT REALLY HAS A VERY EXTENSIVE BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS I TOTALING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT BACKLOG AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE REALLY- CRITICAL PROJECTS. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I'M KIND OF ITS ITS COMFORT LEVEL WITH AND THIS ACTION WHETHER IT WANTS TO- TO TAKE THIS ACTION OR WHETHER FOR EXAMPLE ONCE YOU CONSIDER BACK FILLING AND SUMMER ALL OF THOSE FRIENDS AND REALLY DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH. IT WEIGHS THERE'S DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AS PARTNER FOR. OF THE- PARKS AND RESORTS DEPARTMENT SAID THEY REALLY THAT THIS IS THE BEST USE OF- AFTER. MUCH SO SEARCHING OR SOME SEARCH- I AM I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT YOU HAVE. THE SECOND SOME LIVE HERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE LAKE FERRIS STATE RECREATION. AND I GUESS YOU KNOW I KNOW ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT WOULD SAY OH WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO A THESE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE FOR THE KEEP ONE WALL UP IN A COMPLETELY BUTTE REBUILD THE WALL BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND. SOME LOCAL HOUSING ORDINANCES THAT YOU CAN'T DO WITHOUT THE KNOCKDOWN POLICE WERE BEING HONEST THAT THE THIRD LIFEGUARD HEADQUARTERS AT LAKE FARE AS FOR THE- COLONEL ALLENSWORTH STATE PARK IT'S GOING TO. RESULT IN A NEW VISITOR CENTER AND THE OFFICERS CENTERS CRITICAL KAPUT. WHY IS THAT THE BEST USE OF THE FUNDS RATHER THAN THE DEFERMENT. I MEAN OF RATHER THAN JUST GENERAL MAINTENANCE BECAUSE WE GOT STILL HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. EVEN IF WE PUT THE FIFTH SIXTEEN AND THERE. YES GOOD MORNING MY COULD GET US WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THIS ONE TIME THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRIORITIZING CAPITAL PROJECTS AS A MEANS OF INVESTING IN THE IPROVEMENT AND RESTORATION OF THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. THE MAJORITY OF CAPITAL PROJECTS AND IN PARTICULAR THESE PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH THIS FOR VERSION WHAT REALLY EMPHASIZED ON THE RESTORATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE PURCHASE SPEND WAYS THAT ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY SIMILAR TO- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME- DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO. AND ULTIMATELY THESE PROJECTS WILL HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT OF FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE VISITOR EXPERIENCE AT THE PARK SYSTEM. I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID NOT PUT ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY AND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT THERE WASN'T ANY MONEY IN FOR- WILDFIRE PREVENTION ON THE PARKS WHICH IS YOU KNOW WE- AT LEAST THE MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THE CROSSOVER BETWEEN. YOU KNOW WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND FITTING OF FORCE ON STATE OWNED LANDS ACTUALLY HELPS OUT WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS SOMETIMES. THIS THE TREE LINE ON THE TRAIL HIGH CASES IS THE- IS THERE SOME REASON. THAT THAT YOU DID THAT YOU SAID YOU THIS I SEE THIS PROPOSAL'S GOING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY BUT TO SORT OF. THIS- PHILOSOPHY THAT I'M MISSING. WITH THE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WELL THEY HAS BEEN A BROADER AND- ON CAPITAL. IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET I DID YOU KNOW NOTE THAT ADMIN. EVALUATES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS ON ESTATE LEVEL ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN LIGHT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES RECENT APPROPRIATIONS AS IT RELATES TO OTHER PRIORITIES. I GUESS WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE- SENATE MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH MESSAGE HERE I'M JUST GOING TO REITERATE YOUR POINT- ABOUT WE ARE SPENDING TIME ON THE SIXTEEN MILLION WHEN WE HAVE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT WITH THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WERE ADVANCE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SYSTEM. IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE SHOULD REDOUBLE THOSE EFFORTS THIS YEAR I GET IT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON THIS FUN OF THESE FUNDS THAT THAT WOULD BE ADVANCE AND IT'S A DROP I THE BUCKET COMPARED TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO AND WOOD SINCERELY HOPE ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WATER SUPPLY. RESTROOM FIRE WATER SUPPLY EMERGENCY INGRESS AND EGRESS OUT OF CAMPGROUNDS- THAT WE ARE ABLE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN ADVANCE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. NUMBER WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR INTO STATE PARK SYSTEM WITH THIS SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS AT THAT AT THE STATE IS WITNESSING THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER. OKAY BUT SEPARATE PROVISIONS WE HOLD THAT MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION- WE'RE DRAWN ON THE ISSUE NUMBER NINE AND WILL NOW MOVE TO- ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS THAT WERE ON TODAY'S AGENDA AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPATION NUMBERS. NUMBER IS.
