STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND AS YOU ALL ARE CUSTOM WE BETTER WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE- HOUSE KEEPING ITEMS. AND AND WE DO HAVE- ONE ITEM ON THE AGENDA SO WE'LL GET STARTED GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME I'D LIKE TO CONVENE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE TO LEASE AN ENERGY AS A SUB COMMITTEE. CHARGES PLEASE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE AGENDA HAVE A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENTS TO MAKE WE WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BIGELOW TEMPORARILY FILLING IN FOR SOME MEMBER CHEN. TODAY WELCOME SOME MEMBER BIGELOW TODAY WE WILL VOTE ON ONE BILL THAT IS ON THE CONSENT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING OUR COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY WE WILL HOLD OUR TRANSMISSION INFORMATIONAL HEARING. HOW MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY AN INDIVIDUAL WITH DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED- FROM THE ROOM OR THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE- IF FILE THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH THAT- ACTIVITY. CALLING NUMBER FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS. 877-692-8957 AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WEBSITE. AS WELL AS ON THE TV SCREEN WE ARE ALSO ACCEPTING WRITTEN TESTIMONY THROUGH THE POSITION- LETTER PORTAL ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE ONE MEASURE. ON THE AGENDA IT IS ON CONSENT. AND WE WILL- WAIT TILL- WE ESTABLISH FORM TO TAKE AN ACTION ON THAT MATTER BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE ABLE TO CALL FOLKS FOR THE INFORMATION HEARING. AND SO THOSE WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING ON THE FIRST PANEL IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR WAY UP TO THE- TO THE FRONT. AND WE WILL- I GUESS RECESS THIS THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE SESSION AT THIS TIME SO WHILE WE GO TO RECESS ON THE ACTUAL HEARING WITH THE ONE ITEM THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND WE WILL GO INTO THE- TRANSMISSION- HEARING. FOR TODAY. ONCE OUT WOULD WELL SO AS YOU GET SITUATED I'M GOING TO RECONVENE THE- OFFICIAL HEARING BECAUSE WE DO HAVE APARTMENTS ALL ASK THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL TAKE THAT ONE ITEM THAT'S ON CONSENT. EDUARDO GARCIA HI. HERE PATTERSON PATTERSON HERE BEAR CAN BIGELOW. BIGELOW HERE CARILLO CARRILLO HERE CUNNINGHAM CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HERE HOLDEN. THEN HERE MAYES MAYES HEAR MURATSUCHI CORK AIRPORT HERE REYES REYES HERE SANTIAGO KING. THAT'S NINE OKAY SO WE DO HAVE A QUORUM WE DO HAVE ONE ITEM ON CONSENT CALENDAR THAT IS EASY ARE ONE EIGHT EIGHT BY MR HOLDEN DO I HAVE A MOTION AND MOTION AND A SECOND TO MOVE THE ITEM ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR AREN'T ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT- SECRETARY RON PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ACR ONE EIGHTY EIGHT THE MOTION AS BE ADOPTED TO CONSENT EDUARDO GARCIA HI. IN ORDER C. I. PATTERSON PATTERSON AYE BARRICADE HANDS.

CORK I REYES REYES AYE SANTIAGO KING THAT'S NINE OKAY THE CONSENT ITEM HAS BEEN PASSED WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER COLLEAGUES TO ADD ON AND THAT THIS TIME WILL RECESS THE OFFICIAL- UTILITIES AND ENERGY HEARING AND A CALL THE- TRANSMISSION HEARING TO ORDER. WANT TO THANK YOU ALL WHO HAVE- JOINED US TODAY WOULD LIKE TO CALL THIS NOW THE INFORMATION HEARING TO ORDER WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS. THE NEED FOR NEW TRANSMISSION IN ORDER TO MEET OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS SPECIFICALLY WE WILL EXPLORE HOW WELL OUR PLANNING PROCESS- PREPARES US FOR FUTURE TRANSMISSION NEEDS. CHALLENGES THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PROCESS AND SOLUTIONS THAT ENSURE WE CAN MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SB ONE HUNDRED ESTABLISHED THE STATE POLICY THAT RENEWABLE AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES SUPPLY A 100% OF ELECTRICITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FIRST JOINT AGENCY SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT FOUND THAT IN ORDER O MEET. THIS POLICY CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO BUILD SIX GIGAWATTS OF NEW CLEAN RESOURCES EVERY YEAR THIS REPORT DEMONSTRATES. THAT THE 1100% CLEAN ENERGY POLICY IS ACHIEVABLE BUT REQUIRES BUILDING ELECTRIC FACILITIES AT AN UNPRECEDENTED PACE. HAND IN HAND WITH THIS NEED FOR NEW RESOURCES IS A NEED FOR TRANSMISSION TO CONNECT PROJECTS TO THE POWER GRID. A RECENT STUDY BY THE CLEAN AIR TASK FORCE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND CONCLUDED THAT CALIFORNIA MUST DOUBLE. ITS TRANSMISSION CAPACITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THIS NEW HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION TAKES ON AVERAGE TEN YEARS TO BUILD. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROCESS TO BRING NEW FACILITIES ONLINE. ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE. THIS BILL WILL BE THE FIRST OF MULTIPLE HEARINGS. PLAN BY THIS COMMITTEE TO FOCUS ON TRANSMISSION AND WILL NARROWLY. FOCUSED ON STATEWIDE PLANNING EFFORTS AND ACTIONS WITHIN CAL I SO WE HAVE INVITED A PANEL TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS WITH TRANSMISSION PLANNING. ASSET ALL POUNDS PROVIDE THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS THEN WE CAN TURN TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. WE WILL START WITH MARK ROSSITER SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEFOPERATING OFFICER. THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WELCOME. THANK YOU- JERRY GARCIA AND- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY I'M GONNA QUICKLY HANDED OFF TO- NEIL MILLER VICE PRESIDENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE- PLANNING. OF ALL TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ACTION ON A SKI ARE ONE EIGHTY EIGHT. IT ALSO- MY ROLE AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER IS BOTH A- RESPONSIBLE FOR IT INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING BUT ALSO OPERATIONS AND IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. AS AN OPERATIONAL MATTER THAT THE PLANNING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BE TIMELY- AND BE. CONSIDERATE OF WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS ARE. AND IT'S VERY BECOMING MORE MORE CRITICAL THAT THAT IT BOTH RESOURCE AND TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE ARE PLANNED IN ADVANCE SO THAT THEY COME ON LINE IN TIME SO THAT WE CAN ALSO LET SOME OF THE RETIREMENT OF RESOURCES THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING OFF OF A RETIRE. SO TAT I'M JUST GONNA QUICKLY HANDED OFF TO NEIL MILLER WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL OPENING STATEMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE GARCIA AND IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WALK THROUGH THE WE DO HAVE A PRETEXT THAT WOULD JUST TOUCH ON. THANK YOU AND WHAT I WAS LOOKING TO DO WAS TO TOUCH ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES SO WE USED TO MOVE TRANSMISSION PLANNING FORWARD. AND ALSO TO INDICATE THE WITH THE ACCELERATION OF A NUMBER OF KEY INPUTS WE ARE HAVING TO PICK UP THE PACE TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE NEED TO OVER THE NEXT DECADE. SO IF I COULD JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FUNDAMENTALLY ARE THE ISA'S ANNUAL TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS IS A VEHICLE USED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TRANSMISSION ACROSS THE 80% OF THE STATE THAT FALLS WITHIN OUR FOOTPRINT. THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING IS REALLY DONE BASED ON THREE MAJOR INPUTS. AND THAT IS THE LOAD FORECAST WORK DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THE RESOURCE PLANNING CONDUCTED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AS WELL AS ALL OF THE RELEVANT OF FEDERAL AND STATE AND OUR EYES SO OWN PLANNING REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA. EACH YEAR WE PRODUCES ANNUAL TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT THAT OBLIGATES SOMEONE TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET THAT TRANSMISSION BUILT. AND GENERALLY THE TRANSMISSION FALLS INTO MEETING THE NEEDS OF RELIABILITY NEEDS. ACCESS TO RENEWABLE GENERATION TO IS TO ACHIEVE STATE GOALS. AS WELL AS LOOKING FOR TRANSMISSION UPGRADES THAT CAN ALSO. HELP LOWER THE OVERALL DELIVERED COST OF ELECTRICITY BY ACCESSING LOWER COST RESOURCES. TO THOSE OF THE KEY MAIN INPUTS THAT REUSING. AND IN ALL THREE OF THOSE AREAS WERE HAVING TO ADAPT AND CHANGE. ACTUALLY IF I COULD JUST MOVE. ALL PASSED THIS SLIDE THIS LARGELY HAS THE WORDS I JUST SPOKE TO AT CENTER SPEND JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES ON THIS- THE GRAPH THAT YOU SEE AS PART OF WHAT'S DEMONSTRATING THE NEED TO ESCALATE THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT. THAT GRAPH REPRESENTS THE- LOAD GROWTH PROJECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THE LOWER BLUE LINE WAS THERE COMPREHENSIVE FORECAST DEVELOPED TWO YEARS AGO. THE RED LINE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IS THE CURRENT FORECAST LOOKING OUT OVER THE NEXT DECADE SO THIS IS DEMONSTRATING ASIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOAD GROWTH ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE TRANSFER ME- OTHER INDUSTRIES AND TRANSPORTATION. TRANSITION TO ELECTRICITY TO REDUCE THEIR OWN CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THAT THAT'S ALSO ONE OF OUR OTHER INPUTS INTO OUR PLANNING PROCESSES THE IMPACT IT HAS ON PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RESOURCE PLANNING. THE PLANS WE BASED LAST YEAR'S TRANSMISSION PLAN ON WERE KEY TO ADDING A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCES A YEAR OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE PLAN OR BOARD JUST APPROVED IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WAS TIED TO A PACE OF TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS A YEAR. AND A PLAN WE'RE NOW WORKING ON IS KEY TO RESOURCE PLANS CALLING FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS TO BE ADDED EACH YEAR OVER THE NEXT DECADE. SO THAT RAMPING UP BOTH OF LOAD REQUIREMENTS CUSTOMER DEMAND REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO SERVE FULL LOAD. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF RETIRING RESOURCES IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO DRIVE AN ACCELERATION OF OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND INITIATING NEW TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. IF I COULD MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE OTHER CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS COMPETITION FOR PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES IS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND WELL AT TIMES WE ALSO FACE THOUGH A BIT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF RICHES OUR CURRENT INTERCONNECTION QUEUE. IS SITTING AT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ASSETS SEEKING TO CONNECT TO OUR SYSTEM. THAT IS A GREAT DEAL OF COMPETITION FOR A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT OF AUTHORIZED PROCUREMENT JUST TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT- LAST JUNE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AUTHORIZED THEIR SINGLE LARGEST EVER. A RESOURCE AUTHORIZATION WHICH WAS FOR ELEVEN POINT FIVE GIGAWATTS OR ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCES. OUR CURRENT INTERCONNECTION QUEUE IS STANDING UP WELL OVER TWENTY TIMES THAT AMOUNT. SO WINNOWING DOWN THROUGH THE AMOUNT OF PROJECTS APPLYING TO GET CONNECTED AS THEY ARE ALSO SEEKING. TO GET TOP POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH UTILITIES AND OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. IS OBVIOUSLY A CHALLENGER HAVING TO DEAL WITH. LAST YEAR ALONE WE ADDED OVER A HUNDRED OF ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF. OF ASSETS TO THE INTERCONNECTION QUEUE SEEKING TO GET CONNECTED. AND AS I SAID COMPETITION IS GOOD BUT THIS LEVEL OF COMPETITION DISTRACTS FROM THE PROJECTS THAT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER VOLUME. IF I COULD MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS YEAR'S TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT I ALREADY MENTIONED- HAS BEEN MOVING FORWARD SHOWING THAT ACCELERATION OVER THE TEN YEARS WE'VE CALLED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE PROJECTS TOTALING TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN COST. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION A YEAR AND CAPITAL IN OUR TRANSMISSION PLANT SO THIS IS MORE THAN A TEN FOLD INCREASE. WE ALSO TOOK THE STEP OF TRIGGERING THIS YEAR OF DEVELOPING A TWENTY YEAR TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK. THAT IS NOT AN APPROVAL DOCUMENT IT WAS A WAY TO PROVIDE SOME LONGER TERM VISION FOR WHAT THE GREAT BUT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF GETTING TO A 100% CARBON FREE. AND THAT HELPS PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR. PLANNING DECISIONS SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IN THE NEAR TERM AND SETS OUT LONGER TERM STRATEGY OUT- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WAS JUST AHEAD ON SOME OF THE KEY AREAS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WE THINK THERE CAN BE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT RECOGNIZING THE VOLUME OF TRANSMISSION THAT NEEDS TO BE PLANTED BUILT. AND THAT IS BOTH THE NETWORK UPGRADES AS WELL AS THE INTERCONNECTION FACILITIES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THESE RESOURCES TO PIPE TO THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE SIR CUSTOMER LOAD AT THE OTHER END SO FIRST ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE OF COURSE TO STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS. IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED THE TIME LINES THAT CAN TAKE FOR AT TIMES HAVING TO REVISIT THE NEED FOR CERTAIN TRANSMISSION FACILITIES LATER IN THE PROCESS CAN ADD YEARS TO GETTING CERTAIN pTRANSMISSION BILL AND WHILE WE ALWAYS AGREE THAT- THESE DECISIONS NEED TO BE PROPERLY VETTED SOMETIMES THE TIMING IS AN ISSUE OF WHEN THEY'RE BEING VETTED AND HOW. ALSO POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS BEING PUT IN PLACE RIGHT NOW ARE LARGELY JUST FOCUSED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS OUT. LONGER TERM PROCUREMENT TO IDENTIFY WHICH PROJECTS WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD. WHAT HELPED US FOCUS OUR PRECIOUS ENGINEERING RESOURCES ON THE PROJECTS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD. INSTEAD OF KEEPING SOMEBODY ALIVE FOR NEAR TERM COMPETITION. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WHERE THIS IS NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR THE ICE OF IT PERHAPS FOR THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY AND IN ACHIEVING THESE OUTCOMES WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL. VOLUME OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ENGINEER AND BUILD ALL OF THE FACILITIES THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND TO US THAT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE WE WON'T SOLVE THAT JUST BY HIRING OR STAFF AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE. AND LASTLY WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH OUR OWN PROCESSES AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ACTIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW. LOOKING FOR WAYS TO OPTIMIZE OUR OWN TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND GENERATION INTERCONNECTION PROCESSES. THESE OF OFTEN BEEN HELD UP ACTUALLY AND- BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION OF SOME OF THE BEST IN CLASS. BUT WE DO HAVE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GET ANY EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVEMENTS OUT OF THOSE PROCESSES AS WELL. SO I'VE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION BUT THAT WRAPS UP. THE INITIAL COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT- MISTER MARK. RATHER NO I GUESS ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ADD AS A- AS WE ALL KNOW. THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING. A NEW GENERATION NEW RESOURCES ON CLEAN RESOURCES CLEAN IT'S A CLEAN FLEXIBLE RESOURCE ON. IS BECOMING EVER MORE CRITICAL- AS YOU ARE WHERE WE RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THIS YEAR WE STILL SEE. DEFICIENCIES THAT POTENTIALLY PUT THE SYSTEM IN VULNERABILITY AT LEAST A HIGH LOW LEVELS IN EXTREME CONDITIONS. CERTAINLY CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING US BOTH IN TERMS OF WILDFIRE RISKS- BUT ALSO JUST- THE- RISK OF HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HIGH LOADS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND ALLOWING US TO MOVE THE GET THE SOME OF THESE ARE. OLDER RESOURCES RETIRED. SOME OF THAT'S GONNA TAKE RESOURCES BUT IT'S ALSO GONNA TAKE CURRENT MISSION. AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A COORDINATED WAY WHERE THE TRANSMISSION THE SERVICE PORTAL RESOURCES AS IN PLACE. IN THE RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT PLACE. THAT COORDINATES WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE MESSAGE. THAT THE ANNUAL CONTAINER HERE FROM US THANK YOU NEXT PRESENTER THAT- MY BAKER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I ALSO HAVE A SLIDE PRESENTATION- AND I. HI MY NAME IS MATT BAKER- THE DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WE ARE THE INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE FOR AFFORDABLE SAFE RELIABLE UTILITY SERVICES- CAN YOU MOVE THAT SLIDE TO I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE COST IMPACTS OF THE TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT- AND OFFER AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW WE MIGHT WANT TO STUDY TO SEE IF WE CAN MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE COSTS- WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NEED- NEW TRANSMISSION IF ONLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF NEW CHEN GENERATION WIND AND SOLAR. THAT WILL REQUIRE IT- WE ALSO KNOW THAT WILL NEED TO DEVELOP THIS IN A QUICKER TIME FRAME THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST- AND FINALLY GIVEN THE RATE PRESSURES THAT WE'RE FACING WE WILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO TRY TO CONTROL THE COST AND CERTAINLY CONTROL THE GROWTH IN THE COSTS. IN THIS PRESENTATION I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RATES TODAY- I WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW THE TRANSMISSION INVESTMENTS IMPACT RATES AND WHAT THEIR TRAJECTORY AS AND FINALLY- AND WITH A FEW DIFFERENT IDEAS ON THINGS THAT WE CAN STUDY T AMELIORATE THIS PROBLEM. IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- EDUCATION SEE FROM THIS SLIDE RATES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN EXCEEDING THE RATE OF INFLATION THESE FIGURES WERE PROVIDED BY THE STAFF AT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. THE BLACK LINE AT THE BOTTOM REPRESENTS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OVERALL YOU KNOW EACH UTILITIES RESIDENTIAL AVERAGE RATE HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ON THIS SLIDE WHAT WE'RE DEMONSTRATING HERE IS THAT WITH IN THESE RATE INCREASES TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE TAKING UP HIGHER AND HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAT MEANS THEY'RE PUSHING RATES UP- AND THIS IS HAPPENING FOR AGAIN ALL OF THE BIG THREE UTILITIES- IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- AND ON THIS SLIDE WE'RE SHOWING THAT WHAT THE ACTUAL TRANSMISSION COSTS. HAVE BEEN. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE- COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER THREE HUNDRED PERCENT- TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE RECOVERED FROM THE FEDERAL ENERGY THROUGH. TRANSMISSION OWNERS MAKING A FILING TO THE TRIP TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. THIS IS COLLECTED THROUGH FROM THE RATE PAYERS VIA BOTH A HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE WHICH IS FOR FACILITIES. TWO HUNDRED KV AND ABOVE AND A LOW VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE AT BELOW TWO HUNDRED- CAVESE. THE FIRST IS PAID FOR BY ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS IN THAT CASE- TERRITORY THE SECOND IS PAID BY THE CUSTOMERS OF EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL I- USE WHERE IT TAKES PLACE- AND AGAIN AS YOU CAN SEE. THIS CHART SHOWS THAT THE YOU KNOW THE GROWTH OF THE HIGH VOLTAGE TACK SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IF YOU CAN MOVE THIS NEXT SLIDE. WHAT WE WANT TO SHOW HERE IS THAT THE TACK IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. TO INCREASE FURTHER- AS- THE REPRESENTATIVE SOME KAITO ALLUDED TO- RECENTLY THERE WILL THEY PUT FORWARD THEIR TWENTY YEAR TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK- AND THIS DOES EXPLORE THE LONGER TERM GRADE REQUIREMENTS AND HOW WE WILL MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. RELIABLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY- WHAT THIS CHART SHOWS IS THAT BY TWENTY FORTY TO BASED ON OUR CALCULATIONS USING- THE TAX CALCULATOR PROVIDED BY OKAY SO WE'LL SEE A 90% INCREASE TO THIRTY ONE DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR- SO JUST TO RECAP. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALREADY IN A SITUATION WHERE RATES ARE INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY. ADMISSION COSTS FOR ONE DRIVER OFTHOSE RATE INCREASES AND THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL. TO MEET OUR CLIMATE OBJECTIVES AND TO HAVE A RESILIENT RELIABLE SYSTEM. WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE TRANSMISSION SO THESE COSTS WILL GO- THE QUESTION WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORWARD IS KIND OF WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WORK. IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. ONE THING THAT AFFECTS THE COST OF TRANSMISSION IS HOW YOU FINANCE IT- WE'RE NOT ADVOCATING ANY PARTICULAR WAY WITH THE SLIDE DOES IS IT ILLUSTRATES. FOR DIFFERENT FINANCING MODELS- JUST TO SHOW HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THINGS LIKE THE RATE OF RETURN AND WHETHER YOU'RE FINANCING WITH DEBT OR EQUITY- CAN HAVE ON THIS. I'M SECOND YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- WE ARE ALSO OPTIMISTIC THAT- IN THE FUTURE- ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WILL HOPEFULLY HELP US AVOID INTO FOR TRANSMISSION COSTS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW THE QUESTION WE WANT TO ASK IS YOU KNOW CAN THESE TECHNOLOGIES NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN INCREASING EFFICIENCIES TO SMART WIRES. CAN THE SCALING OF BATTERIES CAN THAT HELP RELIEVE CONGESTION AND LOAD POCKETS CAN IT HELP US TO COST EFFECTIVELY DEFERRED TRANSMISSION IS NOT REALLY COST EFFECTIVE IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING THEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER YOU HAVE TO BUILD TRANSMISSION AGAIN SO YOU WANT TO WANT TO LOOK AT THAT- ENDED DO THIS WE NEED TO BE REALLY BEING DISCIPLINED IN PILOTING DEMONSTRATIONS. LEARNING FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS STRESS TESTING THE SOLUTION SO THAT THEY MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF ROUND RELIABILITY- AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SCALE THEM AND IN PARTICULAR WE'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT. EITHER BOB IT'S EITHER AN INCLUDING BEHIND THE METER BATTERIES ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES AND ALL OF THE BATTERIES THAT WERE INVESTING IN THE BULK POWER SYSTEM YOU KNOW WHAT POTENTIAL CAN THEY HAVE YOU KNOW TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. AND THEN FINALLY- IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT TRANSMISSION COST OVERRUN. LARGE TRANSMISSION PROJECTS HAVE A HISTORY OF COST OVERRUNS- A TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY BY THE BATTLE BRATTLE GROUP OF EIGHTEEN- CALLIE SO APPROVED PROJECTS SHOWS THAT IN OUR THERE WAS AN AVERAGE. COST ESCALATION OF 40% WHY NINE PHYLLIS SOME OF THE MORE- EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THESE COST OVER RUNS. IN I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHY IS THIS HAPPENING- WHAT ROLE IS SITING AND PERMITTING- AND THE DELAYS CAUSED IN THERE WHAT ROLES THAT PLAYING IN THESE COST OVER RUNS. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS DUE TO POOR PROJECT PLANNING OR POOR EXECUTION. AND THEN FINALLY CAN WE DEVELOP. INCENTIVES FOR WAYS TO HELP SHIELD RATEPAYERS FROM SOME OF THE RISKS OF COST OVERRUNS SO- AND I I'LL JUST SAY YOU KNOW TO SCALE THE CLEAN ENERGY BUILD OUT AND THE SCALE THE TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT. REALLY GOING TO NEED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE COST ISSUES AND REALLY BE MINDFUL OF THAT. FINALLY IN CONCLUSION YOU KNOW IN A DECARBONISE WORLD WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE CLEAN ELECTRICITY ORGANIZED A LOT MORE CLEAN ELECTRICITY- CARDS CURRENT DRAFTED THAT SCOPING PLAN ENVISIONS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ELECTRICITY THAT'S CLEAN. FOR TRANSPORT BUILDING AND INDUSTRY- WE HAVE A SYSTEM THE TRANSITIONING TO RUNNING MORE AND MORE ON WIND AND SOLAR- AND THIS WILL REQUIRE MORE TRANSMISSION. YOU KNOW SO WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS OUT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE RATES AND BILLS HAVE INCREASED FASTER THAN INFLATION. UNTIL WE REALLY GOT AGAIN LOOK AT YOU KNOW CAN WE CONTROL THESE COSTS. AND JUST TO REITERATE. WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME CONSIDERATION- ARE STUDYING OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO FINANCE THESE PROJECTS THAT FIT WITHIN. HOW WE DO THINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO SEE- AND EMPHASIS- CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON LOOKING TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE A WAY TO HELP ADDRESS COST OVER RUNS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDRESSING SITING PERMITTING AND CONSTRUCTION DELAYS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU I'M GONNA PAUSE HERE AND ASK ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF OR FOR THE FIRST TWO. PRESENTERS DR. THANK YOU- FIRST I THINK- FOR MR MILLER. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THESE TRANSMISSION COSTS ARE DIVIDED. HOW MUCH IS IT TOO- HOW MUCH OF THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO NEW GENERATION SITES. OUT IN THE DESERT FOR SOLAR OR WIND. AND HOW MUCH IS DUE TO INCREASED- USAGE MORE LECTER COMBS MORE LOCKED VEHICLES AT CETERA. IT IS IT'S STILL HERE WITH THE AYE SO THE- AND IN OUR ANNUAL TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS WE'RE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING THE NEED FOR EACH TRANSMISSION UPGRADE. WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO GO BACK AND REASSESS THOUGH EXACTLY TO SAY WELL THIS IS THE IMPACT ON RATES FROM THIS TYPE OF PROJECT VERSUS THAT TYPE. BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO PICK THE BEST OVERALL TRANSMISSION SOLUTION IT'S RARE THAT THOSE ARE JUST MEETING A SINGLE PURPOSE SURE SO SOME OF THE PROJECTS ARE QUITE CLEAR WE CAN IDENTIFY SOME MAJOR PROJECTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO REACH OUT INTO NEW AREAS AND ACCESS YOU NEW RESOURCES. BETTER WITHIN THE LARGER NETWORK ITSELF QUITE OFTEN OUR SOLUTIONS ARE A COMBINATION OF HELPING US MEET THE LOAD RELIABILITY NEED AND ALSO HELPING ACCESS FROM RENEWABLE GENERATION. AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THIS YEAR'S TRANSMISSION PLANT. WITHOUT APPROVAL FOR A- A NEW MAJOR FIVE HUNDRED KV SUBSTATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIABILITY BENEFITS INTO THE AREA. AND ALSO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO NORTHERN SACRAMENTO VALLEY RENEWABLE RESOURCES SO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE MEETING MULTIPLE PURPOSES BUT WE DO TRY TO GIVE THE KEY INDICATORS IN OUR TRANSMISSION CLASS. I DO NOT TO HAVE A RATE IMPACT OF ONE VERSUS THE OTHER I'M AFRAID ALL RIGHT WELL. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT- AND I PARTICULARLY HERE. WOULD LIKE TO- GET ANY COMMENTS THAT THE- MISTER BAKER IS WILLING TO THINK ABOUT THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF EQUITY CONCERNS HERE AND- YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. VERY LOW USAGE AND ALSO WHO SAY DON'T HAVE CARS AND YET A LARGE PART OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IT'S GOING TO BE ELECTRIC CARS ELECTRIFICATION FOR RUSSIA. HOMES IT'S CETERA BUT PARTICULARLY FOR CARS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CARS OR WHO USED TO FUEL OTHER THAN LUCK TRICITY. ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON. AND THE IS WHY I ALWAYS HAVE IF KNEW. HOW MUCH WAS INCREASED USAGE VERSUS. DIFFERENT TERM TRANSMISSION BUT THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CARDS OR HAVE DEEP FEW CARDS FOR THE OLD ON HYDROGEN OR BIO FUELS AND ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO ALSO PAY FOR THIS INCREASE TRANSMISSION. IT'S CLEARLY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW FOR HOW MUCH THIS IS COSTING BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE TO BE FAIR- SO MISTER BAKER WHAT DO YOU THINK. SO I THINK I WOULD ADDRESS THAT QUESTION IN A COUPLE OF WAYS BUT HISTORICALLY THE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IS AS WE INVESTED MORE IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. WE WERE ALSO INCREASING USAGE SO THOSE ELECTRONS WERE SPREAD OUT OVER MORE AND MORE USERS YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE A DECLINING- COST OVER THE OVER THAT TIME FRAME. AND I THINK DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO ELECTRIFICATION PARTICULARLY OF TRANSFER OF PARTICULAR EVIL OF CONSUMER VEHICLES- YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE THAT AS WELL AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL REALLY WANT. TO IS YOU KNOW MAKE SURE COST BECAUSE THERE'S ARE THE ONES WHO WILL ABSORB THE COST OF IT- BUT ALSO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT ELECTRIFICATION IS DONE IN A WAY SO THAT IT. MINIMIZES THE AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE BORN AND I THINK WE'LL WE'RE MINDFUL OF. THE CONCERNS YOU'RE RAISING AROUND. OU KNOW THE TYPES OF VEHICLES THAT PEOPLE DRIVE AND I THINK WE WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT OKAY. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE- INCREASE. IN TRANSMISSION AND PROJECTS. I THINK A LARGE PART OF THAT TEHACHAPI OVERRUN THIS DUE TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF LOCAL OPPOSITION THEY- THEY WENT. WENT UNDERGROUND WITH THE WIRES WHICH WILL BE DOING OF COURSE A LOT MORE OF- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER PROJECTS BUT THIS ONE. I WOULD THINK THAT A LARGE FRACTION THAT OVERRIDE WAS DUE TO THE UNDERGROUNDING ZACHAREK CORRECT. AND HI FOR DOING A LOT MORE THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. THE AND IF I COULD JUST THAT ARE NOT THAT HAVING TO TAKE THESE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AROUND THE THUS THE ROUTING OF THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF AND WHERE THAT MIGHT LEAD IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO IN OUR OWN PLANNING PROCESSES AND A TRANSMISSION LINE WITH THAT WENT INTO SERVICE A FEW YEARS AGO IN SAN DIEGO WHEN WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING SO THAT THERE WERE NO SURPRISES WE COSTA DEL BOTH THE COST OF OVERHEAD AS WELL AS UNDERGROUND AND IT SPECIFIED ARE LEVEL ONE OR THE OTHER. BUT WE DID PROTECT THE PRICE INTO ACCOUNT RIGHT FROM THE START WITH THE HATCH P. ADMITTEDLY WE DID NOT SEE THAT COMING BUT ANOTHER PROJECTS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE ARE TIMES WERE GOING UNDERGROUND CAN ACTUALLY SAVE US SOME MONEY BY REDUCING THE CITING COSTS AND LAND ACCESS COSTS BEYOND YOUR ALSO AS YOU YOU'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO FINISH PROJECT ON TIME IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WIRES. WHY IS SAN DIEGO. SUCH A- DIRT THEY'RE PAYING A LOT MORE FOR TRANSMISSION THAN THE OTHER SAN DIEGO- ELECTRIC GAS ELECTRIC IS PAYING A LOT MORE FOR TRANSMISSION I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND PG&amp;E WITH VERY SPREAD OUT- BASS AND I CAN UNDERSTAND ADDISON BEING IN A MUCH MORE COMPACT- BUT WHY IS SAN DIEGO SO HIGH YOU WOULD THINK THAT THERE. WELL I JUST. CURIOUS. THE RESULT IN YOUR GRAPH IMPAIRING THE THREE- I'LL USE CLUSTER TRANSMISSION. OKAY CLOSER TO THE COMMISSION TRANSMISSION CAN WITH CENTER ANDRE. I IT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW IS READING I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY- I'M ASSUMING THAT THE SUIT AND THAT THIS IS JUST ONE THING AT THE CHEQUERED THESE HIGH VOLTAGE OR TOTAL TRANSMISSION COSTS. HIGH VOLTAGE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF RATES. OKAY SO IF I'M SORRY IF THIS IS THE HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION CHARGE- AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR RATE IT COULD JUST ALSO BE A FUNCTION OF THE REST OF THEIR RATE BECAUSE SOME TYPE THE HUBBLE BUT I SHOULD ALSO CLARIFY OUR HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION CHARGES ARE COVERED ON A DOLLARS PER MEGAWATT HOUR. FROM THE UTILITIES OR THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THAT ARE SERVING THE LOAD BUT THE WIRES RATES THEMSELVES REFLECTED DECISIONAL RATE DESIGN SO NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME RATE DESIGN FOR HOW TRANSMISSION COSTS THAT ARE BEING LEVELIZED THROUGH OUR PROCESS ARE BEING RECOVERED FROM RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN APPLY DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURES AS WELL IN THEIR FINAL RATE DESIGN THAT WE DON'T HAVE DISABILITY YEAH SAN DIEGO OVER ALTHOUGH HAS HIGHER RATES PERIOD. FOR THEIR CONSUMERS. CAN I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD WHY BACK TO YOU ON THAT SOME OF THE INITIAL THINGS THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH PENETRATION OF ROOFTOP SOLAR IN THEIR- VERY SPRING TO COST UP QUITE A BIT THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR MORE OF A- YOU KNOW A WIRES COMPANY THEN. ON THE OTHER THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES BUT WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE EXACT ANSWER ON OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THE QUESTIONS- QUESTION SIR. THERE WERE TWO QUESTIONS WHY ON THE EFFICIENCY SIDE. OF BOTH FR MR RIGHT LETTER AND MR MILLER. YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR LAST SLIDE THAT THE ISO'S REVIEWING YOUR GENERATION INTERCONNECTION PROCESSES. WAS THAT INVOLVED IN TO SPEAK FUTURE INTERCONNECTION CLUSTERS HAVING SIMILAR VOLUME. ISSUES YOU SEEN WITH CLUSTER FOURTEEN. YOU HAVE ANY POTENTIAL REMEDIES FOR THIS IF THAT'S WHAT THINGS ARE ADDED WE'RE GETTING FROM. AND I THAT MAINLY FROM OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TEND TO DEVELOP THESE APPLICATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE VARIOUS INVESTORS IS THAT WE COULD SEE AS MANY OR EVEN MORE APPLICATIONS COMING OUT US AND THE NEXT CYCLE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE THINK WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT IN SOME AREAS WE ARE LOOKING AT INCREASING THE APPLICATION FEES AS WELL AS INTRODUCING OTHER REQUIREMENTS. TOO SO THAT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD CAN MOVE FORWARD ON A MORE TIMELY BASIS AND THAT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT READY TO MOVE FORWARD TO SOME EXTENT STEP ASIDE AND MAKE WAY FOR THE ONES THAT ARE SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WE'VE ALREADY ASKED OUR BOARD TO APPROVE CERTAIN CHANGES TOWARD TARIFFS ALREADY IN THAT REGARD. AND WILL BE BRINGING THE- YOU READY. DO THIS YEAR CELS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AS WELL. SO PART OF THAT IS TO MANAGED- AND FOCUS THE ATTENTION ON THE ONES THAT ARE READY TO MOVE SO THAT WE'RE NOT DISTRACTED BY THE LARGE VOLUMES THAT ARE NOT OKAY I THINK IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK JUST HAVING. A RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLAY OUT SO THAT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING CONTRACTED ARE MOVING FORWARD AND REALLY AND IT AND THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY GET CLEARED OUT OF THAT A PROCESS SO KIND OF THIS BACKLOG OF HAVING A LOT OF. DEMAND BUT NOT A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IS- EXACERBATING THE ISSUE. OKAY NO QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS THAT. IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS USE INPUTS FROM THE CPUC TO DO YOUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING- BUT THEN YOU MUST DEFEND THOSE SAME DATA POINTS- WHEN YOU'RE BEFORE THE CPUC. AND DONNA WERE WONDERING I MEAN IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY OF GOING ABOUT- GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WITH OUR TIME- TO ULTIMATELY GET TO THE END GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN WEB AND ASKED THE SAME QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR MAKERS WELL. AT THE CELLS WHAT ONE IS. YOU DAD HAD AN ISSUE THAT SHOWS UP AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I'VE TESTIFIED IN ALMOST EVERY. MAJOR TRANSMISSION FILING IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S GOING TO HEARING. AND THAT THAT THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW IT'S FOR ITS IN FRONT OF US THAT WERE RELYING ON INPUTS FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ITSELF. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS WE WOULD FOR TO SEE. MORE MORE SCRUTINY. AT THE PROJECT INITIATION STAGE. INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE DETAILED ROUTING ENGINEERING WORK AND REVISITING THE QUESTION OF IF THE LINE WAS NEEDED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO GETTING MORE SCRUTINY OUT FRONT BUT BACKING OFF ON THIS AFTER THE FACT. DUPLICATION WOOD WE THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT NOW HOT WHAT SHAPE THAT TAKES THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS OUT THERE BUT AS A FUNDAMENTAL GOAL THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD REALLY SEE SOME. OPPORTUNITY FOR. THANK YOU COULD I JUST ADD THAT WE- WE DO- WE DO PARTICIPATE IN BOTH THE CDC PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE- THE- THE FORECAST AND WE PROVIDE. SOME INPUT ON THAT AND- COLLABORATE- BUT ALSO IN THE CQC PROCESS OF THE RESOURCE PLANNING WE DO HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND WE DO COMMENT. IN THE RESOURCE PLAN BEFORE IT IS FINALIZED AND APPROVED AND THUS KICKING OFF THE INPUT TO THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS SO WE DO EXERCISE THOSE ANA. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE. THANK YOU MUCH BAKER. YEAH I WOULD SAY WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT- YOU KNOW. THE PROPERTY FOR BY TO THE APPLE I WOULD SAY OUR- WE ARE NOW STUDYING. HOW WE CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE UP FRONT. IN THE PLANNING PROCESS- AND WAYS TO GET SOME OF THE COST CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE CARE ABOUT ADDRESSED UP FRONT DOOR LOOKED OUT UP FRONT- AS OPPOSED TO. DOING SOME OF THAT FROM CANDOR FROM THE END PART OF THE STRATEGY BUT WE DO SEE THAT THAT IS THE- ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. RIGHT THANK YOU EVER HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF GO AROUND ONCE MORE IF NOT THANK YOU- YOU'RE NOT GOING VERY FAR SHE US SO WE MAY COME UP WITH SOME. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL GO ON WITH THE- AGENDA WE HAVE SINCE JENNY MEN AND WITH VICE PRESIDENT ASSET STRATEGY AND PLANNING. FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GARCIA AND MEMBERS OF THE- MY NAME IS XIN GINNY MANON AND I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF ASSET MANAGEMENT AND BY FIRE SAFETY AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRANSITIONS AHEAD OF US. YOU KNOW THE BABY LOOK AT THAT THE VALUE OF THE ELECTRIC GRID GOES BEYOND THE COMMODITY COST OF THE ENERGY DELIVERS. THE GREAT POWERS ALL ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY AS ELECTRICITY BECOMES THE FUELING SYSTEM FOR A LARGER PART OF THE ECONOMY WE MUST RE IMAGINED WHAT THE FUTURE GREAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE AT ALL LEVELS. AND HOW IT MUST FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY TO MEET THOSE EXPANDED NEEDS. IN RECENT HISTORY LOAD GROWTH AN ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUTS HAVE PROCEEDED AT A MODEST PACE. WITH THE REASONABLE PREDICTABILITY. WHILE AN ELECTRIC SYSTEM UPGRADE CAN TAKE AS LONG AS A DECADE DECIDE LICENSE BUILD AND COMMISSION THE EXTREMELY LONG LEAD TIMES FOR MANAGEABLE GIVEN THE SMARTEST PREDICTABLE GROWTH. HOWEVER WE ARE CURRENTLY AT AN INFLECTION POINT VERY RAPID ACCELERATION IN ELECTRIC GRID UPGRADES AS NEEDED COMPARED TO WHAT WAS SUFFICIENT HISTORICALLY. SO IT'S ESSENTIAL TO PREPARE SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE DECARBONISATION ACCELERATED ELECTRIFICATION IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS FOR A MINUTE ON THE DECARBONISATION ASPECT. DECARBONISATION OF OUR ECONOMY WILL BE A POOR DRIVER OF HOW THE PLAN DESIGN AND OPERATE THE ELECTRIC PARADE GOING FORWARD. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS UPDATING THE STATE'S COPING SPLAT BAND AS WE SPEAK THAT CRAFTING THE STATE'S BLACK TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM ARE MONUMENTAL. FOR THE ALTERNATIVE THAT CARPET HIGHLIGHTED AS THE PREFERRD SCENARIO ALTERNATIVE THREE. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE ELECTRIC LOAD WOULD INCREASE BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS FROM TWENTY TWENTY LEVELS. WE WILL NEED TO BUILD OUT SEVEN GIGAWATTS OF SOLAR AND DO BIGGER WALKS OF BATTERY STORAGE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. FOR CONTEXT HISTORICALLY WE HAVE ONLY BUILT OUT LESS THAN THREE GIGAWATTS OF SOLAR AT THE MAXIMUM. AND WE NEED TO CONNECT ALL OF THAT TO THE GREAT TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND FROM ELECTRIFICATION. BY 2035100% OF THE ANNUAL LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES SOLD IN THE STATE WILL BE ZERO EMISSION. WE ALSO EXPECT MAJOR CHANGES IN HOW CUSTOMERS WILL USE ELECTRICITY WHICH WILL PLACE UNPRECEDENTED STRESS ON THE GRID PREDICTABLE SUPPLY WILL BE MORE INTERMITTENT AND DEPENDENCE ON ELECTRICITY FOR TRANSPORTATION HOMES AND BUSINESSES WILL INCREASE. CONVERSATIONS WITH CC THE CPUC ADVERTISER REVEALED A GROWING APPRECIATION OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US AND THE NEED FOR ACTION NOW. I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT TO HIT THE SHARED GOALS WE WILL NEED TO DO MORE THAN TRANSMISSION UPGRADES. MEETING INCREASED LOCAL DEMAND AND INTERCONNECTING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES WILL ALSO REQUIRE UPGRADES AND NEW DESIGN AND OPERATING STANDARDS AT THE BILL XIN LEVELS AND AT CUSTOMER SITES. AS THE GREAT GETS MORE COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED TECHNOLOGY WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT AS WELL WHETHER IT IS FOR COMMUNICATION AUTOMATION MORE SENSORS ON THE GRADE OR CYBER SECURITY. TO OPERATE A SAFE SECURE RELIABLE AND FLEXIBLE GRADE YOU MUST ALSO INVEST IN THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE. LET ME QUICKLY GO THROUGH A TOUR OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BEFORE US A LOT OF YOU THIS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WHAT SPECIFICALLY MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH EACH NEW VEHICLE SPEAK CHARGING BEING ROUGHLY THE EQUIVALENT OF ADDING A NEW HOME TO THE CORRECT. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE ELECTRIC GRID WAS BUILT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DIMOND WILL COME FROM DEVICES THAT ARE NOT STATIONARY MAKING LOAD FORECASTING BY LOCATION MORE DIFFICULT. NOT ONLY WILL THE UNCERTAINTY OF DEMAND FORECASTING INCREASE THE VARIABILITY IN POWER SUPPLY WITH RENEWABLE RESOURCES BUT ALSO INCREASE AS MANY OF THESE ARE INTERMITTENT RESOURCES. THIS IN TURN WILL CHALLENGE THE GRID STABILITY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCE. CONNECTING MILLIONS OF SOLAR PANELS BATTERIES AND ELECTRONICS TO THE GREAT COULD CAUSE WIDESPREAD POWER QUALITY IMPACTS SUCH AS VOLTAGE DISTORTIONS. WHICH IF LEFT UNMITIGATED WOULD SHORTEN THE LIFE OF CUSTOMER AND GREAT EQUIPMENT LIKE. THE BUSCA FUTURE RENEWABLE RESOURCES WILL BE LOCATED FAR FROM CUSTOMERS AND THE CURRENT TRANSMISSION GRID WOULD BE UNABLE TO DELIVER ADEQUATE POWER TO OVERLOOKED CENTERS. THE GRID WOULD BE EXPOSED TO GROWING CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS RECENT WILDFIRES AND HEATWAVES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ONLY PROOF OF THE ACCELERATION OF THESE CLIMATE CHALLENGES. WE CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS CHALLENGES BUT WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS. IN SHORT READ PLANNING DESIGN AND OPERATIONS NEED TO INVOLVE STARTING RIGHT NOW. THOUGH THERE ARE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TRAJECTORIES OF DEMAND GROWTH AND RENEWABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THE END GAME. THAT IS WE MAY NOT KNOW THE EXACT PATH BUT WE ALL KNOW A DESTINATION. CALIFORNIA SHOULD MAKE REASONABLE REFORMS TO THE EXISTING PLANNING REGINA AND PERMITTING PROCESSES WE NEED LONGER TERM PLANNING AND WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THE DEMAND GROWTH CURVE BY BEGINNING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS NOW. WE SHOULD HAVE ELECTRIC UTILITIES PROACTIVELY UPGRADE THE GREAT BY PROVIDING THEM ADEQUATE COST RECOVERY ASSURANCES. GETTING AHEAD OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND WORSENING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS WILL ALLOW AVOID COSTLY JUST IN TIME SOLUTIONS PREVENT THE GREAT FROM BEING A BARRIER TO ELECTRIFICATION AND DECARBONISATION. AND IN FACT ENABLE AN EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ECONOMY. WE SHOULD ALSO EXPAND ENERGY SYSTEM PLANNING ACROSS STATE AGENCIES TO LONGER TERM TIME HORIZONS AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE DECARBONISATION OBJECTIVES. WE NEED TO WORK ON THE NEAR TERM NEEDS AND LONG TERM TARGETS WITH EQUAL URGENCY. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE BUILT TO SUPPORT SB ONE HUNDRED AND CARBON NEUTRALITY ALL PARTIES AGREE ON THIS POINT TWO. SO SPECIFICALLY FOR TRANSMISSION. TWO THINGS FIRST WE NEED TO PLAN USING DIMOND AND RESOURCE FORECASTS THAT COULD ACTUALLY MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS OR AT LEAST HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE TO MEET THOSE GOALS OTHERWISE WE FALL FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT KIND SO TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS OR D. B. B. INCORPORATES TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS THE TEN YEAR PLANNING HORIZON OFF CRISIS B. B. B. DOES NOT CURRENTLY INTEGRATE THE POTS HIGHLIGHTED BY CARP SCOPING PLAN SCENARIOS. TO HELP HIGH SO THE STATE SHOULD REQUIRED THAT THE CC PROVIDE FULL FIFTEEN YEAR I PER FORECAST TO THE CHI SO FOR USE IN ITS STEEL B. B. AND I PER FORGOT SHOULD REFLECT A BIBLE TRAJECTORY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THAT INCORPORATE STATE POLICIES LAWS REGULATIONS. AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE I PER FORECAST TO THE HI SO FOUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING SHOULD REFLECT THE STATE POLICIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION. IN OUR VIEW THIS WILL HELP. ENSURE TIMELY MODELING AND APPROVAL OFF A LONG LEAD TIME TRANSMISSION OPERATES BY THE CRISIS. SECOND WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A UNIFIED STATE AND LOCAL CITING AND APPROVAL PROCESS. ONE KEY CHALLENGE WITH TRANSMISSION DEVELOPMENT IS THAT PLANNING BETWEEN RELEVANT ENTITIES IS NOT ALIGNED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND VARIOUS AGENCIES ARE NOT EQUIPPED WITH PLANTS THAT COULD BE CHEAP THE STATE'S GOALS. AS THE SB ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY REPORT NOTED A UNIFIED PLANNING PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SCALE ENERGY PROJECTS AND RESPECTIVE TRANSMISSION LINES MUST BE CONSIDERED. IT WILL ALSO BE IMPERATIVE TO FASTRACK HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS BELLOWED IS BOUND TO INCREASE WITH THE SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY CONSTRAINED ARE CLOSE TO BEING CONSTRAINED AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS VITAL FOR EXAMPLE LOCATIONS IN COMMUNITIES NEAR THE PORTS MAJOR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS AND WAREHOUSE DISTRICTS. IN OUR VIEW THE STATE DOES NOT NEED NEW AGENCIES OR NEW PUBLIC FINANCING MECHANISMS IT NEEDS COMMONSENSE REFORMS OF THE EXISTING PROCESSES TO ENABLE PROACTIVE GREAT INVESTMENT INVESTMENTS AND MINIMIZE THE TIME TO CONSTRUCT TRANSMISSION LINES. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON SOLUTIONS OURSELVES AS THE UTILITIES EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF HIGH ELECTRIFICATION SCENARIOS TRANSITIONING FROM A BRIT CENTRIC DO A MORE CUSTOMER CENTRIC PLANNING. AND STREAMLINING OUR INTERCONNECTION PROCESSES IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED CLIMATE GOALS AT AN AFFORDABLE AND EQUITABLE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO CUT CURRENT TIME LINES DOWN AND FIND WAYS TO UNDERSTAND TODAY WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE WILL BE LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT TO MY TENT THANK YOU ALL ASKING YOU MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF YOUR PRESENTATION. NO QUESTIONS BUT I LIKE TO GET A COPY OF YOUR PRESENTATION. CAN YOU SEEN THE OTHER QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TO CENTER- CAMERON. YOUR HEALTH CARE SENIOR REGULATORY AND MARKET AFFAIRS MANAGER. EDP RENEWABLES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS CAMERON KASKY I WORK FOR EDP RENEWABLES WERE UP- GLOBAL NATIONAL MULTI TECHNOLOGY RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPER. AND ALSO ASSET OWNER- WE DO WIND SOLAR STORAGE OFFSHORE WIND HYDROGEN WE HAVE- MOSTLY UTILITY SCALE BUT ALSO DISTRIBUTED GENERATION. BUSINESS I AGREE WITH A LOT OF COMMENTS OF THEIR PANELISTS SO FAR TODAY I WANT TO- PRIMARILY ADD TO THE SENSE OF URGENCY AROUND THE TRANSMISSION QUESTION. IN MY VIEW I THINK IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST BARRIER TO REACHING OUT MERE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS I PREACH APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION FROM THE COMMITTEE. ON THIS ISSUE I WILL SAY THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA- BY ANY MEANS IT'S ONE OF THE LARGER CONCERNS- AND ALL THE STATES THAT WE WORK AND TRANSMISSION IS FUNDAMENTALLY A- A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO DEAL WITH- A TOUCH ON SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS AT ALL I'LL GET I BROUGHT JUST A COUPLE SLIDES- THERE ARE REFERRED TO IN A LITTLE BIT- THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. BUT SO I TOUCH ON SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK TRANSMISSION IS SO DIFFICULT IN SOME AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. ONE IS THAT THERE'S SO MANY ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THEY'RE ALL DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER RIGHT TRANSMISSION OWNERS. AND OPERATORS THEY REALLY NEED TO BE TOLD- BY THE GENERATORS AND THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO CONTRACT FOR NEW RESOURCES SO THEY KNOW WHERE TO PLAN AND BUILD THE NEW TRANSMISSION TO. THE SAME TIME ON OUR HANDS- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE CONFIDENT THAT THE TRANSMISSION WILL BE THERE ONCE OUR GENERATION IS BUILT- SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY. IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY ON TIME- AND THEN THE STATE SIDE YOU KNOW WE ALL NEED THE REGULATORS. BLESS THOSE INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCE SOMETIMES AND ALSO YOU KNOW DO THE PERMANENT WORK- TO MAKE THE TRANSMISSION HAPPEN. SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE CONVENE ALL THE ENTITIES WHERE SOME STATE LEADERSHIP I THINK CAN REALLY BE CRITICAL- TO HELP DRIVE THE INDUSTRY FORWARD IN CUTS THROUGH- SOME OF THOSE CHICKEN AND EGG ISSUES. ABOUT THE OTHER ISSUE A TRANSMISSION IS IT IT'S BEEN TOUCHED ON ALREADY TODAY BUT IT JUST TAKES SO LONG RIGHT IT'S BY FAR THE LONGEST LEAD TIME- ASSETS INVOLVED IN OUR ENERGY TRANSITION WE CAN BUILD. OUR CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES ARMATURE ONCE ANYWAYS IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS- BUT IT TAKES YOU KNOW SEVEN TO TEN YEARS TO BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION- EVEN FOR. CERTAIN JUST UPGRADES WHICH SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE YOU'RE RE CONDUCT DURING. TRANSMISSION TOWERS IN EXISTING RIGHT AWAY IT'S NEW SEEN SIGNIFICANT DELAYS FOR THAT WORK. SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHY THE CRISIS TWENTY YEAR OUTLOOK- IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THAT REGARD. LAYS OUT THE FUTURE PICTURE OF WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO GO WITH TRANSMISSION NOW WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND- INCLUDE IT PROCESS SEES IN THE STATE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS- SOON SO IT'LL BE READY WHEN WE'RE BUILDING THOSE RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE. THE OTHER ISSUE WITH TRANSMISSION THAT WILL BE NO SURPRISE TO FOLKS IS THE PERMITTING CHALLENGES- THAT IS JUST DIFFICULT CITING LINEAR FACILITIES- IS DIFFICULT NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EASY WAY AROUND THAT BUT- I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME PRINCIPLES THAT CAN BE HELPFUL WITHOUT ISSUE ONE IS STARTING EARLY. AND WE HAVE THE TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK NOW- IT PAINTS A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE FROM WHERE E WILL NEED SOME UPGRADES I THINK STARTING THE PERMITTING PROCESS ON SOME OF THOSE LINES SOONER. RATHER THAN LATER AND HAVING THE PERMITS READY TO BE A PRUDENT STEP- THE OTHER POINT HERE IS TO USE ON CITING IS TO USE. OUR CORRIDORS AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. AND IF- THE STAFF TO GO TO THE WATER SLIDE. WHEN I BROUGHT- THIS. I MEAN A- THANK YOU. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT PICTURE I WANT TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT ILLUSTRATES SOME OF BOTH THE LAND AND COST THE COLONIES OF SCALE BUILDING BIGGER TRANSMISSION PRESIDENT INCREMENTALLY GOING IN AND BUILDING- SMALLER TRANSMISSION ON A AS NEEDED BASIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE- SEVEN SIXTY FIVE KV TRANSMISSION CORRIDOR- EXAMPLE VERSES OF THREE FORTY FIVE KV EXAMPLES. SHOWS SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW COSTS PER MEGAWATT OF TRANSFER CAPABILITY SAVINGS ALMOST A FIVE FOLD SAVINGS PLUS YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY SEE THE ADDITIONAL RIGHT OF WAY SO- EFFICIENCIES THERE SO IF WE CAN GO IN AND REPURPOSE. EXISTING RIGHT AWAY WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER FACILITIES THAT EXIST TODAY. AND AND ADDS LARGER TOWERS THERE WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY COST EFFECTIVELY- TO THE TRANSFER- CAPABILITY. THE OTHER- QUICK POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS OFF OF THAT OTHER SLIDE IS JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE COST OF TRANSMISSION- AND WE'LL SEE IN A SECOND THREE DIFFERENT THE NATIONAL STUDIES BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MEET CLEAN ENERGY STANDARDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY- AND NOT TO TAKE AWAY- FOR ME MISTER BAKER'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE COST OF TRANSMISSION I THINK PUT BOTH THESE THINGS CAN BE TRUE. THE COST OF TRANSMISSION IS INCREASING IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. TO KEEP OUR EYES ON BUT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY HERE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE. BUT THE LARGER CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES THEY WERE GONNA HAVE TO ADD TO THE SYSTEM. THESE THESE THREE DIFFERENT STUDIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LOOK AT THE TRANSMISSION TO SUPPORT THAT AND THE COSTS OF THE TRANSMISSION TO SUPPORT THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THAT CONTEXT THE TRANSMISSION IS ACTUALLY A MUCH SMALLER. PORTION OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENTS FOR THE SCREENER TO TRANSITION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT BROADER PERSPECTIVE TRANSMISSION ABOUT SMITH IS REALLY MEANT TO SAVE COSTS AND GET ACCESS TO. CHEAPER PREFERRED RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE- SO WITH THAT I THINK. WE'LL START TO CLOSE AND- LOOK FORWARD ANY QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION- FROM THE PANEL WHICH IS WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE LEADERSHIP ON THESE TRANSMISSIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU LICENSE- FOR THIS PRESENTER YES SIR. WHAT WOULD DO THAT IT BENEFICENCE YOU GOT A GOOD LUCK IT WE HAVE ONE THAT LAST PRESENTER THAT SAID TENNIS WICK YEAH ACTUALLY P. DIRECTOR OF PERMIT CINEMA. CLICK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE IS A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE AGAIN I'M TENNIS WICK THE DIRECTOR PERMITS IN OMAHA THE LAND USE PERMITTING AUTHORITY FOR THE COUNTY CINEMA I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA- COUNTY PLANNING DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA- SONOMA COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO. MORE EFFICIENT PERMITTING WHEN IT COMES TO RENEWABLE ENERGY WE WERE THE FIRST COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA TO PARTNER WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY INFORMING- SOLAR APPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S REDUCED OUR PERMITTING TIMES FOR A RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR AND STORAGE- FROM A WEEK DOWN TO NINETY MINUTES- AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUTURE EFFICIENCIES AND WORKING WITH PRIVATE AND STATE PARTNERS WHEN IT COMES TO. RENEWAL THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION AND STORAGE- MY COMMENTS THIS AFTERNOON FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON STORAGE- WHERE WE ARE SEEING A PRIVATE ENTITIES COMING IN AND MAKING REPRESENTATIONS TO US ABOUT STATE NEEDS- AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO HEAR FROM STATE AGENCIES ABOUT. WHAT CAPACITY WE NEED TO PLAN FOR HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO ACREAGE AND- PROXIMITY OF THESE FACILITIES TO SUBSTATIONS. IF WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN MOVE OUT OF THE AD HOC PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NOW USE PERMITS AND DESIGN- AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WHICH IS THE COMMITTEES I'M SURE FAMILIAR WITH TAKE. ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THREE YEARS TO MOVE THROUGH A PROCESS TO SOMETHING WHERE IF WE IF WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED UP FRONT. WE CAN- REDUCE THAT TIME. TO A MINISTERIAL PERMIT- BY DOING ALL THE UP FRONT PLANNING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW CHANGING THE GENERAL PLANS. AND ZONING ORDINANCES SO WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THESE USES. THAT RIGHT NOW IT AND I SHOULD SAY REGARDING ESPECIALLY THE STORAGE UNITS IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE USE ITSELF THEY'RE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO FIGURE OUT IT'S REALLY THE SETTING WHERE THE SUBSTATIONS ARE LOCATED. AT THE TIME THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BUILT MANY OF THEM- GREAT DEPRESSION ERA LOCATIONS THEY WERE ON THE PERIPHERY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT NOW. THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT HAS COME AN ENCROACHED AROUND THEM AND THEIR NUMBER OF MORE SENSITIVE RESOURCE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BEFORE- WE CAN AUTHORIZED READY SO THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS. FOR THE RIGHT THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL OF. THE PANELISTS AND I MEAN I WOULD HAVE GOT A LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS HERE THAT I'M A JUMP INTO BUT OPEN IT UP FOR SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO A TO START OFF. SO FOR MR WHERE- ARM. AGAIN PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR- MORE ELECTRIFIED HOMES. AND ALSO FOR EV'S YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK YOU WOULD HAVE TO REVISE YOUR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE ARE YOUR TRANSFORMERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE. MADE LARGER- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL WIRES BUT THEY CAN CARRY- IS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THIS PLANNING BUT CAN YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT OR I ALSO FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EDISON AFTER. MR SINNOTT MISTER RADHA WICK FINISHES. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WELL FORTUNATELY LOCAL REGULATORS RARELY GET INTO THAT LEVEL- THAT THAT FIELD WE DON'T OCCUPY. AND IT'S- I THINK OUR CHALLENGES FACED WITH THAT AND THEN THIS HAPPENS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA RELATIVELY OLD OLD HOUSING STOCK. SO NOW THAT WE'RE THE COST OF MONEY STILL RELATIVELY CHEAP WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF REMODELING AND THAT'S WHEN- THE SOLAR INFRASTRUCTURE AT LEAST ON THE PRIVATE SIDE ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. BECOMES OUR PRIMARY FOCUS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT HOLDING ANYTHING BACK- WHEN IT COMES TO LARGER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. MY COLLEAGUES HERE DISCUSSING CURRENT AND THEN FOR MISS MARYLAND- HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REBUILD OF YOUR CURRENT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT DEMAND PROBABLY DOUBLES. WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS SEES RIGHT NOW. AND BUT WE DO EXPECT I JUST SPEAK DIRECTLY INTO THE MICROPHONE YOU NEED THEY DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT ME AND PEOPLE WILL HEAR YOU MUCH BETTER. WE DO EXPECT THAT THE DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED BOTH TO MEET THE LOAD OF ALSO TO INTEGRATE THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY ROSE MY RESOURCES THAT THE BILL BE IN A- OTHERS ROOFTOP SOLAR OR- OTHER STORAGE FACILITIES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. IN ADDITION LOCALLY BEYOND THE DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE- AS- THE BOSTON FEEL PLANS- YOU KNOW I RETIRING. IN THE IN THE LOCAL AREAS AND TO BRING IN THE TRANSMISSION TO DO THAT URBAN LOTS CENTERS. THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SUB TRANSMISSION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED AS WELL. OKAY BUT DID GOING TO DOUBLE RATES RIGHT REYES AND BY 2% DO WE HAVE ANY BALLPARK NUMBERS THERE. I AM UNABLE TO GIVE YOU AN EXACT PERCENTAGE RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS NOT- IT'S NOT MINIMAL AND I CANNOT TELL YOU IT IF IT'LL BE DOUBLE ARE NOT SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW BUT BE EXPECT SIGNIFICANT. BUILDOUT NEEDED AT THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION LEVELS DO LIKE I SAID BOTH TO MEET THE- LOAD GROWTH AND ALSO TO INTERCONNECT THE RENEWABLE RESOURCES. AND THEN MISTER BAKER HAVE YOU BEEN CONSIDERING THIS ALPHA. LOCAL REPLACING OF TRANSFORMERS AT CETERA WILL IMPACT- RIGHT IN ADDITION TO TRANSMISSION. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENTIRE BUILD OUT- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT NOT TO DO IT BUT IT IS AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE VERY CAREFUL IN WHAT THE COSTS ARE. AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST. WHAT THE COST OF SERVICES BUT WHEN IT MIGHT HIT. RATE PAYER SO THAT IT CAN BE SPREAD OUT RIGHT BUT BUT IT IS AN ISSUE WE CARE ABOUT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. YES AND I WAS LISTENING TO ONE OF THE- OUR ELECTRIC. LOCAL LAW ENERGY PRODUCERS AND SUPPLIERS THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT A PARTICULAR COURT TESLAS AND IF SOMEBODY GOT A THIRD TESLA UNLESS PEOPLE WERE SMART ENOUGH JUST TO TEST THEM DIGESTA CHARGE THEM AT THE RIGHT TIME GOOD FOR YOU OKAY. BUT IF THEY DIDN'T THAT- THEY'D HAVE TO PUT IN A NEW TRANSFORMER FOR THAT PARTICULAR RACK COURT- SO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME SMARTER ENERGY ENERGY- USERS AS WELL. TAKEN MMHM. I'D LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING S. LIMIT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED IS- THE REQUIRED TO DO THEIR PLANNING THEIR GOOD PLANNING BASED ON THE DEMAND FORECASTS THAT THE CC PRODUCES THAT'S PART OF THE- I BURKE. AND THEN THE CQC REQUIRES US TO USE THAT AND CURRENTLY. THE AYE PER FORECAST THAT THE CC PROVIDES US DOES NOT INCORPORATE THE LEVEL OF ELECTRIFICATION AND LOAD GROWTH THAT WE BELIEVE IS COMING AND WE BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE- CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS. SO THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY PLAN FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE COLLECTIVELY IS NEEDED FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY. WELL SOUNDS LIKE OMETHING THE CHAIR CAN LOOK INTO OVER THE NEXT MONTHS OR YEARS. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU GOOD QUESTION IT CAN GET INTO THE COST SIDE OF THINGS AND EVERYONE'S WELCOME TO ADDRESS THIS LAST INFORMATION HEARING HELD FOCUSED ON THE RISING ELECTRICITY RATES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND CUSTOMERS FINDING THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE AREA- CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE EXCITED TO SEE THE NUMBER THAT THESE BUT FORWARD. CLEARLY PAINTING THE PICTURE THAT PEOPLE ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH- PAIN THOSE UTILITY BILLS. SO I'D LIKE TO SPEND SOME TIME IN TERMS OF WATER SPECIFIC- ACTION ITEMS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS IT RELATES TO THE BUILD OUT OF THIS. TRANSMISSION NEED THAT WE HAVE TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- KEEPING IN MIND- THESE COSTS THAT ULTIMATELY- IMPACT- REGULAR FOLKS. IN CALIFORNIA WILL DEAL WITH A MISTER MAKER FIRST AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP TO OTHERS. GIVEN THAT YOU DID UP A TOUCH ON SOME POTENTIAL. IDEAS OR SOLUTIONS ON THAT FRONT. YEAH I. I- I THINK WE NEED TO ROUTE EVERYTHING IN WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO WE HAVE TO START THERE AND HAVE TO WORK BACKWARDS SO I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK CARDS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN LAYING OUT KIND OF DIRECTIONALLY WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING AND WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO INTO THE PLANNING PROCESSES- I YOU KNOW I DO THINK- YOU KNOW IT ALL STARTS WITH WHAT WE NEED WHEN WE NEED IT. IS A PLANNING PROCESS- I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN BRING SOME EFFICIENCIES OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE'VE LAID OUT A COUPLE WAYS- LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE'RE FINANCING THESE INVESTMENTS THEIR ENORMOUS THERE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO DO THEIR HUGE. I MEAN THAT THAT THE OVERALL INVESTMENT WILL BE HUGE. HEY SO HOW DO WE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN AND- WE TRANSMISSION H. THERE GENERALLY SAFE INVESTMENTS TO SELL- SO LOOKING AT THAT- I WOULD ALSO. POINT OUT THAT I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THE SITING. AND PERMITTING PROCESSES- BECAUSE I IT. IT IS THE I BELIEVE THAT THEY WHAT WE THINK THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DRIVING UP. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE COSTS BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY HELPING TO STRETCH THE TIME FRAME OUT AND WE REALLY NEED TO WORK- YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY TO BUILD THINGS AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. I THINK I'LL LEAVE MY REMARKS THERE- IT. THAT BUT HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER IDEAS WE HALF THIS AS WELL. IS IT AYE I WOULD JUST SPEND ADD TO THAT- YOU KNOW IN OUR TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS AS WELL WE OFTEN CALL IT THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS BUT WE DO LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES WHAT'S THE LOWEST COST WAY TO MEET THE NEED. AND THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF ACTIVITY ON NOT ONLY WHERE STORAGE MAY EMERGE ON ITS OWN BUT WHERE WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO WORK WITH PEOPLE BUYING STORAGE TO GET LOCATED AT THE MOST AFFECTED AREAS. WE ALSO INCLUDE IN OUR OWN STUDY WORK EACH YEAR WE STARTED AN ANNUAL PROCESS OF INCLUDING HOW MUCH STORAGE IN CERTAIN AREAS WOULD ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE AT HELPING MEET LOCAL NEEDS BEFORE YOU START BUMPING INTO THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO CHARGE THAT STORAGE IN ORDER TO HAVE IT AVAILABLE AT THE NEXT PEAK LOAD. SO THESE ARE PRODUCER SOLUTIONS WERE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH VISIBILITY OF AN TRANSPARENCY ON AS POSSIBLE AND LOOK FOR THE LOWEST COST IN THE LONG RUN. AS MR BECAUSE SLIDE SHOW THOSE QUITE OFTEN. WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE TRANSMISSION COSTS THEY SEE THE COST BUT THE BENEFITS SHOWS UP SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DECISIONS ARE TAKING ALL OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS INTO ACCOUNT. WHETHER THAT'S A TRANSMISSION SOLUTION STORAGE OR OTHER NEW EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT- AT DIFFERENT OF APPLICATIONS OF FLOW CONTROL DEVICES TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE INTEGRATED GRID. AS OPPOSED TO JUST PUTTING POWER FLOW WHERE IT WANTS TO. OUR PHYSICS TAKES IT OUT THAT WE CAN BE MORE ACTIVELY CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICITY. TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE FACILITIES WE HAVEN'T THAT WE'RE ADDING TO THE GRID. SO THAT HOLISTIC VIEW IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO COMING UP WITH THE BEST OVERALL SOLUTION AND THE INTEREST RATE PAYERS. BUT ALSO INVOLVES LOOKING OUT LONGER TERM NOT JUST WHAT'S THE- WHAT'S THE CHEAPEST TODAY. BUT WHAT PROVIDES THE BEST VALUE OVER FIVE TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS. YOU HAVE NOT OF YOU HAVE EQUITY ALL THE IT'S OF PART OF THIS. SO THE TWO- SOLUTIONS THAT I TALKED ABOUT IN MY REMARKS- I'LL COME BACK TO THOSE BECAUSE IF WE CAN A PROACTIVELY PLAN IF YOU GET A HEAD OFF UP- YOU KNOW FOR THE LONGER TERM THAT- LEADS TO A MANAGED TRANSITION AND A MANAGED TRANSITION WILL BE LESS COSTLY THAN TRYING TO CATCH UP AT THE END. DOING JUST IN TIME UPGRADES ESPECIALLY FOR THE LARGE BUILD OUTS LIKE A TRANSMISSION PROJECTS AND THE SECOND POINT IS ABOUT APPROVAL OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT THE LICENSING PERMITTING REVISITING THE NEED THESE ALL ADDS TO TIME AND TIME EAGLES MONEY- EXTENDING EIGHT TO TEN YEARS ALREADY LONG SOMETIMES IT TAKES LONGER- SO. I AND BIT ALSO KEEP IN MIND COUPLE OF OTHER POINTS. THESE SEEMS LIKE BIG INVESTMENTS BUT THESE UNNECESSARY. IT IS INVESTMENTS ARE IN ALICE'S SHOWS THAT IN THE LONG RUN THE ENERGY COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS WILL ACTUALLY GO DOWN BY A THIRD DESPITE ALL THESE INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TODAY. WHETHER IT'S ON THE- RENEWABLE GENERATION SIDE ALL THE GREAT SIDE. AND LASTLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AS WE LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY IS NOT ONLY THE COST OFF THE GRID UPGRADES AND THE INVESTMENTS NEEDED. BUT ALSO. THE COST OF INACTION THE COST OF NOT DOING IT. ESPECIALLY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S NOT THAT BAD EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THE- PEOPLE WHO. ARE DISADVANTAGED OR VULNERABLE IN SOME OTHER WAY KATTAN- BUT DISSIPATE SO HE'S IN A- BEGIN TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN BOTH THE COST OF DOING AND COST OF NOT. UGH GOING AHEAD WITH THESE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU. THIS BAKER HI I WAS JUST GONNA ADD ONE LAST STRATEGY TO THE YOU KNOW LOWER THE COST LOOK AT THE FINANCING- THAT THAT THE LAST PIECES WHEN SOMETHING CAN HIT THE RATE PAYERS BECAUSEOFTENTIMES WHICH YOU'LL SEE AS- YOU KNOW THERE'S INCREASES IN TRANSMISSION AND THERE'S BE AN INCREASE INVESTMENT AND DISTRIBUTION THERE'S WILD FIRE THERE'S ALL OF THESE THINGS AND THEY START TO PANCAKE OP. SO TO WHAT EXTENT AND THIS IS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE STRATEGIC ON HOW WE DO THIS AND THINK ABOUT IT ON THE WHOLE SYSTEM BUT TO WHAT EXTENT CAN INVESTMENTS BE DEFERRED EVEN IF IT'S FOR A TEMPORARY SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME OR CAN TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THE IMPACTS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ON RATES BE DEFERRED THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS. SO ANYONE ELSE. LIKE TO ADD. YEAH I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ANSWERS FROM THE OTHER PANELISTS AND BUILDING OFF OF WHAT MR BAKER WAS JUST SAYING THERE I THINK ALSO BEING MINDFUL OF AS ELECTRIFICATION- MATURES YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD HELP US SPREAD AROUND THE COST OF SOME OF THESE LARGER INVESTMENTS AND WELL SO IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF TIMING AND STAGING MAKE SURE THEY WERE BRINGING UP THE RATE BASE AS A ROUTING UPSET SOME COSTS TO IT. RIGHT GOOD COUPLE QUESTIONS- LET'S GET YOUR OPINIONS ON THE INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION CONCEPT AND DOES THAT HELP US AND THE IMMEDIATE- DOES THAT PUT US IN A BETTER POSITION TO MEET NOT JUST OUR- VICIOUS GOALS BUT- STABILIZES THE GREAT SYSTEM THE OTHER QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW I MADE REFERENCE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THAT LAST TRANSMISSION LINE TOOK NINE YEARS TO SITE PERMIT AND APPROVAL I MEAN IS THAT THE BASELINE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE POINTED TO THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT LONG. TO BUILD ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT- TOOK THAT LONG I MEAN I'D LOVE TO HEAR PERSPECTIVES ON BOTH OF THOSE- QUESTIONS FROM PANELISTS WHO WANTED. TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT. SO WITH REGARD. TURKEY WITH REGARDS TO- INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION I THINK- A WELL PLANNED- INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION CAN BE QUITE EFFECTIVE IN ACCESSING A DIVERSE SET OF TECHNOLOGIES AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OTHER RESOURCES. IT HAS TO COME WITH A- A ACCEPTED RESOURCE PLAN THAT A KNOWLEDGES THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE RESOURCES DEVELOPED AND CONTRACTED IN THAT IN AND ACROSS THE REGION IF IT DOESN'T THEN IT'S A IT'S AN INVESTMENT TO NOWHERE SO IT HAS TO BE AGAIN COORDINATED WITH THE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCE. PROCUREMENT PLANNING- I THINK THE AS A GENERAL MATTER THE HAVING A ROBUST- INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION GRID ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE THE SYSTEM AND OPERATIONALLY WE SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT THROUGH THE WESTERN ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET- WE EXPECT THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WILL INCREASE AND THOSE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WILL INCREASE OVER TIME- BUT IT HAS AGAIN COME ALONG WITH SOME COORDINATED- RESOURCE AND TRANSMISSION PLANNING CONCEPTS ON. ONE AND I THINK. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT AND JUST ON THE ISSUE OF TIMING- I HAVE TO ADMIT UNTIL WE SEE THINGS SHIFTING WERE ASSUMING TOSS THE WORST CASE THAT THESE TYPES OF PROCESSES WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS LONG. THAT'S NOT IDEAL BUT THAT'S OVER HAVING TO BREAK INTO OUR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID UNTIL THERE IS- PROGRESS ON. FINDING WAYS TO STREAMLINE THE PERMIT THE PERMITTING AND SHORTEN THOSE TIME LINES WHICH IS WHERE THE BULK OF THE TIME SPENT TO BE BLUNT THE AMOUNT OF CONCERN TIME SPENT ON ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION NOW IS BECOMING A VERY SMALL PART OF THE TIMELINE PROGRESS WERE WERE HAVING TO MAKE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS INTO OUR WORK BUT THAT'S BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR REALITY SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO PLAN AROUND- BUT- BUT IT'S NOT IDEAL EITHER ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT. TIME FRAME AND OR THE INTERSTATE TRANSMISSION IDEA. JUST ON THE ON THE REGIONAL GRID I WAS JUST EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS BOTH RELIABLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO IMAGINE DOING ALL THREE OF THOSE SAYINGS RELIABLE COST EFFECTIVE- AND CLEAN WITHOUT A MORE REGIONAL ALLIES STE. GRID ON THE TIMING FOR TRANSMISSION. I THINK I WOULD JUST SAY WE SHOULD- PLAN FOR THE WORST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND WORK TO BEAT THOSE TIME LINES AS WELL BUT IT'S DEFINITELY URGENT TO GET STARTED. YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THOSE LONGER TIMELINES IN THE PAST. PLEASE YEAH I'LL JUST ADD ON YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE DEAL GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY FOR THE REASONS EVERYONE ELSE- NOTED- I THINK ANOTHER REASON TO FORMALIZE ANY KIND OF ROOM REGIONAL- TRANSMISSION IS IT ALSO ALLOWS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AGREED UPON COST ALLOCATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS WHICH I THINK WOULD ALSO GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS EASING THAT. OKAY RIGHT IF FOR NO ONE'S GONNA AT ADD ON TO THOSE. TWO QUESTIONS I'M GONNA PAUSE THE INFORMATION HEARING FOR A MINUTE OPEN UP THE- REGULAR UTILITY AND ENERGY HEARING FOR A COUPLE OF MEMBERS HAD ON TO MATTER AND WE'LL GET BACK TO SEARS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON. WHICH UP PUBLIC COMMENTS AS WELL FOR THE HEARINGS WELL SELF AND JUST WAS QUICK PAUSE SO WILL NOT RECONVENE THE UTILITIES ENERGY HEARING. ACR ONE EIGHTY EIGHT BE ADOPTED TO CONSENT OUR QUE HAN. CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM I I CHIANG. ELEVEN IT WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WE WILL RECESS THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY HEARING AND RECONVENE THE INFORMATION HEARING AT THIS TIME- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- THE- DOCTOR WORK. QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY YOU KNOW I I'D LIKE TO DO SOME LITTLE DIFFERENT HERE AND A WEEK WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT FOLLOWS AFTER YOU KNOW THE PRESENTATIONS HERE I'D LIKE TO ASK THE THOSE WHO ARE IN THE PUBLIC- AS THEY COME UP MAYBE YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO- OF THE PANELISTS AND- YOU KNOW NOT AND I GOT YOUR QUESTION RIGHT BUT A CONSTRUCTIVE YOU KNOW QUESTION ON A ON A ON A POINT THAT PERHAPS WAS TOUCHED ON. THAT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME ELABORATED RESPONSE TO ALL OR FOR THAT MATTER A DIRECT QUESTION THAT STATEMENT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE FOR ON THE RECORD AT THIS INFORMATION HEARING SO WE'LL START WITH- ALLEN WITH SAYING THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH PUT YOU ON THE SPOT HERE BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A WELL ROUNDED- OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME POINTS RAISED QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND THEN I'LL COME BACK TO THE PALACE BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADDITIONAL HEARINGS ON TRANSMISSION. AND YOU MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO POINT US IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION THAT YOU YOU'RE LOOKING AND SEEKING DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE SO- MY APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE FOR THE UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH HERE BUT NEVERTHELESS I WANT THIS TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE SO WE'LL START WITH THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT ARE HERE IN THE ROOM HAVE PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION OF YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT PLEASE PUT THAT FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME'S JOHN WHITE I'M WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN IN THE CENTER FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES FIRST ON EXPRESSED GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS AND THE PANELISTS FOR THIS VERY VERY GOOD HEARING COVERED A LOT OF GROUND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN GOOD. IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- ONE OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE COST OF TRANSMISSION IS IF YOU KNEW THE HISTORY OF THE TO HATCH A P. LINE AND HOW THAT UNDERGROUNDING PROJECT HAPPENED IT IT'S A SCANDAL WAS THE INTERVENTION OF PRESIDENT PEAVEY ON BEHALF OF A OF THE CITY AT CHINO HILLS. THE TRANSMISSION RIGHT AWAY WAS WITH THE- LINE WAS ALL. THERE WAS JUST NEXT. WITHIN EXISTING RIGHT AWAY AND PEAVEY OF FORCED EDERSON TO UNDERGROUND AT A COST OF SOME THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT'S A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR WHEN YOU HEAR PG&amp;E TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE. ABOUT TEN THOUSAND MILES WORTH OF TRANSMISSION WE'RE GOING UNDERGROUND WHAT THAT'S THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT AMOUNTS TO ALL THE MONEY THAT THAT. THAT THAT UP TWENTY YOUR OUTLOOK WAS GOING TO COST. SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND WELFARE PROTECTION IS IMPORTANT UNDERGROUNDING IS THE HIGH COST SOLUTION IS NOT THE FIRST THING THAT WE SHOULD DO WE HAVE MICRO GRIDS WE HAVE OTHER ALTERNATIVES SO. SO THAT'S THAT'S A COMMENT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE- THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST OBSERVE IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PUT MONEY FROM THE STATE BUDGET INTO BUYING SUPPLEMENTAL- ENERGY RESERVES IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRANSMISSION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO DELIVER THE PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO COME ONLINE. AND THAT'S A FAILURE ON THE PART PRINCIPALLY OF THE PC. BECAUSE THEY PRACTICE THE JUST IN TIME PHILOSOPHY THAT WE CAN WAIT THERE'S NO HURRY WE'VE GOT ENOUGH AND IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE WRONG YOU KNOW THE IMPORTS FROM THE RETIREMENT OF COAL. WENT AWAY FOR MUCH FASTER OF THE GAS PLANTS CONTINUE TO BE OLD AND DIRTY AND INEFFICIENT THE CLEAN ENERGY IS WHAT'S GOING TO BOTH LOWER COSTS AS WELL AS INCREASE RELIABILITY SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT SUBJECT AND I HOPE YOU STAY WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO. YOU TO HEARINGS AND THESE KINDS OF QUALITY DISCUSSIONS MAKING RIGHT THANK YOU- NEXT WEEK. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR PATRICK WELCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ONE ALSO LIKE MISTER WHITE THANK YOU FOR- DIGGING INTO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ALSO ON THE COSTS AS WELL. DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS SO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT BUT I DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS TODAY. THERE ARE TWENTY PUBLIC POWER UTILITIES THAT RECEIVE THEIR TRANSMISSION SERVICE IN THE CHI SO AND THE REST ARE SERVED BY MUNICIPAL BOUNCING AUTHORITIES WHICH ARE WHICH LARGELY CONTROL THEIR OWN ATRANSMISSION LINES THAT'S SOMETHING FOR IT IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IS THAT CHI SO COVERS 80% THE STATE. THE OTHER 20% THE STATOR COVER BY MUNICIPAL BOUNCING AUTHORITIES AS WELL. WE RECOGNIZE AT C. MADE THE- AND SUPPORT THE NEED FOR SOME DEGREE OF TRANSMISSION UPGRADES AND NEW FACILITIES IN THE CHI SO GREAT TO MEET THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. WE CAUTION THE COMMITTEE THAT THE RUSH TO BUILD TRANSMISSION IN CHI SO SHOULD NOT OBSCURE THE IMPORTANT FOCUS OF IMPROVING OVERALL RELIABILITY IN MANAGING CUSTOMER COST IMPACTS. MISTER BAKER IS ONLY PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION ON THE COST MPACTS OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE CHI SO A TRANSMISSION COSTS HAVE TRIPLED IN THE PAST DECADE. COSTS VARY BY REGION AS MISTER BAKER DISCUSSED BUT IF THE TREND CONTINUES WE ESTIMATE THAT IN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE MONTHLY TRANSMISSION OSTS FOR A CUSTOMER WILL INCREASE FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER MONTH ON THEIR BILL TODAY TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE BY TWENTY THIRTY THAT DOESN'T GET US ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WILL GO UP. THAT'S AN ADDITIVE COSTS THERE'S OTHER THINGS LIKE DISTRIBUTION WILDFIRE GENERATION THAT WILL BE LAYERED ON TOP OF THAT. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY A AVERAGE BY TWENTY THIRTY EVEN AS NATIONAL SPENDING ON TRANSMISSION INCREASES WE COULD BE PAYING 210027% MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FOR MUNICIPAL UTILITIES OF THEIR OWN BALANCING AUTHORITIES FOR SOME TRANSMISSION UPGRADES MAY BE ESSENTIAL IN SOME CASES TO REACHING A 100% GOAL. BUT THEY NEED BETTER PERMITTING AS BUSY HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY AND SEQUEL LITIGATION PROTECTION TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND IN CLOSING MISTER CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE LEADING INTO THIS TOPIC AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND THE REST OF THAT STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU. ARE THANK YOU NEXT NEXT. BIGGER NEXT PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ALSO THANK YOU FOR- HOLDING THIS. THIS HEARING- LOTS OF- GOOD INFORMATION AND- IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME- WITH YOUR STAFF. AND THE WONDERFUL PREPARATION. THAT SHE DID- I WANTED TO MAKE A JUST A FEW POINTS ONE IS A CLARIFICATION THAT P. GENIES UNDERGROUNDING PROPOSAL. PARDON ME A START OVER MISTER CHAIRMAN VALERIE TERRELL OF LAJOS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY MAKE IS THE UNDERGROUNDING PROPOSAL BY P. JEANNIE IS A DISTRIBUTION LEVEL PROPOSAL. THAT'S ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE- THE SECOND IS JUST- AS WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR STAFF- ON ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON COST TRENDS- AND OTHER TRENDS- AT YOU FURTHER EXPLORE- THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS JONATHAN YOUNG WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND I MAY BE WONDERING WHY I'M UP HERE TALKING AND ENERGY HEARING- BUT ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO SPEAK TODAY IS THAT ENERGY IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING ONE OF THE LARGEST COSTS FOR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AS WE WORK ON DELIVERING WATER ACROSS THE STATE- OUR SUSPICION REPRESENTS TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TOP TWENTY NINE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT WITH D. W. R. TO DELIVER WATER FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO AREAS AS FAR AS LA IN THE DESERT AND SO. YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR ENERGY COSTS CAN BE REALLY EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIFTING IT OVER TO HATCH APPEASE- AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO REALLY RAISE AND I THINK- MISTER BAKER AND SEVERAL OTHERS SPEAKERS OF TOUCH ON IT IS JUST THE NEXUS WITH WATER FORD ABILITY ISSUES I'M AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THIS TRANSMISSION NETWORK WE'RE GONNA SEE INCREASING COST PRESSURES ON WATER AFFORDABILITY. ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO DELIVERING CONVEYING OF WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIG CONCERNS IS WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE WONDERFUL PANEL IN THE EXCELLENT SPEAKERS AND THE EFFORT THE COMMITTEES PUTTING INTO THIS SUBJECT. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO- SPEAK CAN PUBLIC COMMENTS. ADDRESS QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS COMPLAINTS- OF THE ABOVE OKAY WE'LL WE'LL GET BACK TO POUNDS IN A MINUTE THANK YOU- IF YOU WANT OF REFLECTING ON THOSE UGH WENT OVER MADE AND YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS WILL ASK YOU IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS TO TOUCH ON THOSE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE MODERATOR- MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY ONE IN LINE TO- THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE. AND WE HAVE NO ONE CLEANED UP. ALL RIGHT SO SAY NO ONE EITHER. ASKED AND ANSWERED. NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE ARE- IN IN IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS AT PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE DURING PUBLIC COMMENTS AND IF SO I MEAN A ONE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO PUT ON TABLES WELL LOT OF OBSTACLES TO BUILD OF TRANSMISSION YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN TOUCH ON WHAT ARE THE TOP TWO OR THREE IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WE NEED TO YOU KNOW PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO GET TO THE END GOAL AND- BUT I'LL JUST TO SAY THANKYOU AGAIN FOR. BEING HERE FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND ALSO YOUR CONTRIBUTION TODAY PLEASE. WILL START. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS. IMPORTANT AND FOR INFORMATIONAL HEARING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TOPIC- I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE DIET SO IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THE NEXUS BETWEEN- RELIABILITY- A CLEAN ENERGY AND AFFORDABILITY AND- WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AS PART OF THE- THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE FRAMEWORK TO BUILD OUT THE RIGHT TRANSMISSION IN AN AFFORDABLE WAY IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF. RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUT WE CERTAINLY DO WANT TO KEEP UP WITH THAT AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PACE OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT HAS TO INCREASE- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT- SOLUTIONS. ARE I THINK THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION AND I THINK IT'S AN AND SITUATION WE HAVE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. INCLUDING AS- HOW DO WE GET DEMAND. ON A TO- REDUCE AT CERTAIN TIMES THAT REDUCES DEMAND FOR TRANSMISSION REDUCES DEMAND FOR ENERGY WHEN YOU NEED IT CERTAINLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFRICAN SHAPE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CONSUMPTION. TO TIMES WHEN WE'RE NOT OTHERWISE PEAKING THAT HELPS THE SYSTEM- IF WE CAN MOVE WATER THROUGH THE SYSTEM AT TIMES WHEN WE ARE NOT- PEAKING THAT IS CERTAINLY A SOLUTION. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE MAN SIDES- SUPPLY SIDE AND THEN COME IN WITH A REASONABLE- TRANSMISSION PLAN THAT LOOKS AT AND ALIGNS WITH THOSE OTHER SOLUTIONS WHETHER IT BE IN STATE OR ACROSS THE REGION AND WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO OUR NEIGHBORS ACROSS THE REGION BECAUSE WE IF WE DO. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A COORDINATED MANNER. SO WITH THAT I AGAIN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IT'S NOT THE END OF DISCUSSION I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THIS BUT- THANK YOU. I'M FINE YES. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM I BELIEVE IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES MENTIONED SEEK WORK REFORM S. SEQUEL BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE IN CITING. UP OUR PLANT POWER LINES. ACTUALLY IT'S THE COMPONENT THAT REQUIRES ANOTHER DETERMINATION OF THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT THAT IS WHERE IT'S SOME OF THE DUPLICATION OCCURS AND ALSO THE DOTE AROUND PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW APPROVED THROUGH OUR PROCESS MOVING THROUGH THE PERMITTING DETAILED ENGINEERING ROADING ACTIVITIES BUT THEN WE REVISIT THE NEED ALL OVER AGAIN. AND THAT THAT CAN ADD EASILY AND HAS ADDED YEARS IN ITSELF TO DIFFERENT PROJECTS WELL SO THAT I'M RETIRED BUT- PERHAPS SOME OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE CAN TAKE THIS UP- TOUCHING THE SEQUEL IS LIKE TOUCHING THE LIVE WIRE BY THE WAY. THE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO AND IF IT IS IN FACT DUPLICATIVE. WEAKER IDEA REFORM SYKORA IN SOME WAY BUT THAT PARTICULAR FOR DECIDING YEARS TO PROJECTS AND THEREFORE MILLIONS MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED. YEAH INCLUDE THAT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US TO SPEAK TO THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC IN THE SECTION. OF I THINK IN CLOSING I WILL. PROBABLY BE REPEATING SOMETHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE GETTING AHEAD OF THE CURVE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND PLANNING FOR THE LONG TERM PLANNING TWO TO FIVE YEARS OUT FOR DISTRIBUTION OR EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OUT FOR TRANSMISSION IS NOT SUFFICIENT ANYMORE. THE GROWTH WILL BE EXPONENTIAL AT THE BACK END BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE SAME AND GOAL IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE HAVING A MORE MANAGED BUILD OUT WILL HELP US LOOK AT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE HOLISTICALLY. PLAN IN A MANAGED WAY LOOK AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT ARRAYS OF BALANCING THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND IN TERMS OF MANAGED CHARGING FOR EV'S ARE IN A MANAGE TIME OF CONSUMPTION BUT THERE IS FOR WATER MOVEMENT OR OTHER. END USE APPLICATIONS AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS LOOKING AT THE APPROVAL PROCESS BOTH FOR THE NEED TO AND DOES A PERMITTING AND SITING. THE MAYBE THAT'S WE CAN DECIDE LOOKING AT THE SUITE OF PROJECTS WHICH ONES ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHICH ARE THE HIGHEST NEEDS LOCATIONS BOTH FROM A GREAT NEED POINT OF VIEW AND ALSO IN EQUITY POINT OF VIEW FROM YOU KNOW AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA AND FAST TRACKING SOME OF THOSE HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS. OF TO START WITH IS ON A LEAVE IT AT THAT THAT MADE I THINK THOSE ARE. THE THINGS THAT CAN START WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HAVING A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE HERE TODAY WE APPRECIATE IT- AND AS I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT WEEKEND. NO THE CAPACITY NEED. THE LAND AND THE PROXIMITY TO THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN HELP WITH SEQUEL- IN REDUCING THE PERMITTING TIME. THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US HERE ARE HEY I THINK I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS JUST THE- WHAT. I THINK. MIGHT THE NEXT STEPS FOR THE COMMITTEE BUT- I THINK. REALLY THINGS THAT I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED TO DO AT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE- THAT YOU KNOW TO TRY TO DO OUR PART. YOU KNOW ONE IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEARLY INCORPORATING WHAT THE STATE GOALS ARE IN THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE. PARTICULARLY THE SCOPING PLAN GOALS AND HOW THAT IN IN IMPACTS OUR ADVOCACY- TO IS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE ENGAGED IN. PARTICULARLY IN TRANSMISSION PLANNING. UP FRONT AND WE WILL BE COMING FORWARD WITH. TO YOU KNOW TO OUR PARTNERS AT QUÉ AT AT CHI SO WITH. SUGGESTIONS ON HOW MIGHT BE TO BETTER INCORPORATE SOME OF THE COST CONSIDERATIONS UP FRONT SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE UP FRONT AND LESS. LESS IN THE BACK. THREE IS WHAT WE DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. HOW ARE FINANCING THESE IN GIVEN THE- MAGNITUDE OF ALL OF THE INVESTMENTS OVER DOING INTO THE SYSTEM. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND WE'D- ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE ALSO TO LOOK AT THAT. WE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS OF THE CURRENT PERMITTING REGIME STAT CITING A PERMITTING REGIME WHAT ACTUALLY ARE GETTING FORMA. COMPARED TO KIND OF OTHER STATES AND- YOU KNOW WHAT TO CREATE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS WHAT MIGHT BE THE BENEFITS OF MAKING IT SHORTER. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FILE ON OUR SIDE AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE- ELECTRIC PLANNING WORLD TO KIND OF INCORPORATE ALL OF THESE IN TOGETHER SO. WE'RE NOT DOING. THE SAME YEAR WERE PUTTING A WHOLE BUNCH INTO BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AND A WHOLE BUNCH IN THE TRANSPORTATION EXTRICATION WHOLE BUNCH INTO- YOU KNOW NW TRANSMISSION. THAT WE CAN SEQUENCE SOME OF THESE OUT OVER REASONABLE TIME SO THAT THEY CAN HIT RATE PAYERS. AT A TIME WHERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE RATE CSAKY DON'T HAVE REBELLION- YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE LOW GROWTH THAT STARTS TO MAKE YOU KNOW TO MEET UP WITH WHAT THE COST GROWTH THIS SOUTH. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE THANK YOU. BASED THANK YOU CHERUB APPRECIATE IT- I WANT TO TOUCH QUICKLY ON THE ON THE SEQUEL A QUESTION- WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME POTENTIAL CHANGES THERE AND I AM- FAMILIAR WITH AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE. JUST THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT A LINE WE CONDUCT DURING WHICH AGAIN IS ALL WITHIN EXISTING RIGHT AWAY WHO WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE FULL C. PCM PROCESS. ONE OF THE LESSER- PERMIT TO CONSTRUCT PROCESS THESE- TAKES UP A YEAR'S ORTH OF TIME OF A TRANSMISSION OWNER'S. LAWYERS TALKING WITH THE SECRET DIVISION JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHICH APPLICATION CAN BE FILED. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE WHERE- SOME VERY STRATEGIC. CHANGES TO CLEARLY DEFINE YOU KNOW WHERE THAT DEMARCATION LINE IS- COULD COULD POTENTIALLY SHAVE OFF A YEAR'S WORTH OF TIME. IN THAT EXAMPLE- BUT IN CLOSING I WOULD. JUST EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ADDRESS THE COST QUESTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. I THINK IT WAS pCRITICAL THERE IS FOCUSING ON BILLS. AND ALL ENERGY COSTS TO CONSUMERS NET NET- AS WE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY. I WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE LEADERSHIP ON TRANSMISSION QUESTIONS I THINK. MAYBE NEED A NEW APPROACH THERE THE- MULTI AGENCY. PROCESS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN TAKES ABOUT SIX YEARS TO IDENTIFY. AND APPROVE NEW TO NEW TRANSMISSION I THINK THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG SO WE NEED A MORE TARGETED. APPROACH TO THAT AND THEN JUST STOP AT THE SIZING IMPORTANCE FOR ALL THIS. OF HAVING. A MORE REGIONAL GRID THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUE HAS OF COURSE ABOUT. ALL IT COMMENT- I'LL GET TO WITH YOU RIGHT AFTER THE MEETING AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT SAKE WELL. NOT USE THAT THE CHAIR MR HOLDEN WHO'S BEEN THE CHAIR HERE OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE AROUND NEXT YEAR- PERHAPS. WE CAN SAY WE'RE NOT CHANGING SEQUEL WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT WHEN SOMETHING'S ALREADY BEEN DONE IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE- IT'S VERY HARD. TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT AND YOU WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF LABOR UNIONS. YOU WILL NEED AT LEAST THE PERMISSION OF THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS BUT- IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN COST AND THAT IS A BIG DEAL FOR US RIGHT NOW. SCOTT WELL I DON'T SEE SCOTT HERE BUT- HE'D BE A GOOD PERSON TO TALK TO- SERVICE HE HE M. HE WOULD BE A GOOD PERSON TO TALK TO READ HE'S GOT THE- LABOR UNIONS THAT. WORK FOR THE UTILITIES I THINK YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AS WELL SOUTH BOB GOOD LUCK I'LL BE GLAD TO TALK TO YOU ANYTIME AND SUGGEST SOME POSSIBLE AUTHORS. GOOD LUCK HE SAID. I THANK DR WE ARE I THINK THIS CONCLUDES OUR- INFORMATION HEARING ON TRANSMISSION CLEARLY- THIS LAST POINT THAT WAS JUST MADE IS OF INTEREST TO US AND PROP COULD BE THE CENTER OF OUR OUR NEXT TRANSMISSION CONVERSATION I THINK IT TIES IN WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF ENERGY. I CHALLENGES THAT- THAT WE ARE FACING ALONG WITH SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE MAY REVISE HAS PUT FORWARD AS IT RELATES TO TRYING TO BACK FILL SOME OF OUR ENERGY NEEDS- FOR TODAY SO- WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS AGAIN AND ALL THOSE WHO- SPOKE DURING PUBLIC COMMENTS- WE WILL ADJOURN THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AT THIS TIME IT'S THREE ELEVEN PM THANK YOU AND THAT WILL RECONVENE THE- UTILITIES AND ENERGY- COMMITTEE HEARING SERGEANTS IF YOU CAN- CALL- THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND I BELIEVE IT'S- BAUER K. HAN- MISTER TEEN. AND THOSE WOULD BE THE ONLY TWO YEAH WHAT WILL LEAVE- THE CALL OPEN FOR A GOOD FIFTEEN MINUTES. THANK YOU HAVE A CARD. HER NAME ON THE RIVER-ACTUALLY MATTERS OF THE COURT. ROBIN ROBERTS. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YOU AND I HAVE. MET YEAH. YEAH REALLY. ONE IDEA CALLED USING THE WE CAN DO. TEN IT WILL OPEN UP THE CALL. ACR ACR ONE EIGHTY EIGHT. MY PHONE.
