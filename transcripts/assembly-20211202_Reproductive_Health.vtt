00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:09.819
A MEANS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.221
BUT IT JUST TO GIVE US A SENSE

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.523
OF WHAT ELSE WE NEED. MOVING

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.326
FORWARD FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IT

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:20.964
WOULD BE HELPFUL. YES SO AND YOU

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.432
KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE CONTINUED

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.434
SUPPORT FOR TELEHEALTH BY VIDEO

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:25.402
AND PHONE VISITS WITH

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.003
APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.239
IS. ESSENTIAL TO CONTINUE OUR

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.474
SERVICES. WE FOUND THAT WE

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.610
NEEDED TO INCREASE AT WE FOUND

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:35.545
THAT WE HAD AN INCREASE IN NEED

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:36.947
FOR TELEHEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:37.447
SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:39.816
PANDEMIC. AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.217
THERE IS AT THIS TIME LACK OF

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.486
STATE FUNDING FOR THIS SPECIFIC

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.256
TYPE OF SERVICE- SYPHILIS

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:48.291
SCREENING IS. CRITICAL TO THE

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.793
FIGHT IF THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE

00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:51.728
SIDE OF THE FIGHT FOR THAT

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:54.130
SIPPLE'S EPIDEMIC- AND WE NEED

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.699
TO FIND A WAY TO. I'D SURPLUS

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.667
TESTING AND TREATMENT- I'M

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.269
FUNDING INNOVATION IDEAS AT

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:00.804
LARGE BY IN PLACES LIKE PLANNED

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.973
PARENTHOOD MAR MONTE IS. IS

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:05.642
ESSENTIALLY THE ANSWER TO AND

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:06.109
MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:08.478
COMMUNITIES. IN GENERAL FUNDING

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:10.614
THAT FOCUSES ON IMPORTANCE OF

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.649
STI TESTING AND PILOTING TESTING

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:14.150
METHODS THAT BETTER MEET THE

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.719
PUBLIC NEEDS EXAMPLES COULD BE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:18.555
LIKE RAPID IN CLINIC TESTING. AT

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.890
HOME TESTING TO INCLUDE PATIENTS

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.860
SELF COLLECTION METHODS- AND

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:24.961
THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:26.696
WOULD BE YOU KNOW THIS THERE'S

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:27.931
THIS DISCOURSE WITH VACCINE

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.567
FUNDING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS-

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:32.602
WE PROVIDE SEVERAL VACCINES IN

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.470
OUR HEALTH CENTERS BUT THERE'S

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.639
ACTUALLY NOT FUNDING FOR US FOR.

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:37.440
TAXIS WHICH IS EACH PEAVEY.

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:40.243
VACCINE AT THIS TIME AND JUST

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.444
WRITE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.612
INCREASE FUNDING AND LARGELY IN

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:46.082
SETTINGS. WOULD HAVE A GREAT

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:52.622
IMPACT. THANK YOU. I WOULD

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:54.357
ACTUALLY ADAM LIVED HER DOCTORS

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.892
WHO TASIA REFLECT ON THAT AS IT

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:57.661
RELATES TO THE DELAYS YOU WERE

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.095
TALKING ABOUT SORT OF WHAT WE

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.665
CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT- BURNING

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:03.433
PEOPLE AND WOMEN WHO NEED OTHER

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.734
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:15.478
SHOWING UP- EARLIER. NO ACTUALLY

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:17.647
I AGREE WITH MISS FREY HONEST ON

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.982
TOP WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED OUR

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:21.484
TELEHEALTH EARNED ABILITIES AND

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.919
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOT

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:23.853
OF FUN IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.188
EXPANDING OUT TO DO

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:28.491
VIDEOCASSETTES AS WELL- AND BE

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.026
ABLE TO BE APPROPRIATELY

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.428
REIMBURSED FOR THOSE VISITS IS

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:34.631
KIND OF CHALLENGING I THINK

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:38.068
THOSE VISITS- AREN'T. AT THE WE

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:40.537
DON'T AT IN TERMS OF OUR

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:42.138
REIMBURSEMENT IS JUST THERE'S

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:43.740
SEVERAL OF THOSE THAT THAT MAKE

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:45.508
UP LIKE A SINGLE IN PERSON VISIT

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.744
FOR EXAMPLE- SO I THINK HAVING

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.546
SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO BE

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:53.149
ABLE TO. INCREASED ONE OF THE

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.617
MAJOR ISSUES WITH MEDIC HOW IS

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.586
THAT THERE AREN'T A LOT OF

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.788
PROVIDERS IN THAT SYSTEM MANY

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:01.224
PEOPLE CHOOSE MANY PHYSICIANS

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:05.328
MANY- CLINICIANS CHOOSE NOT TO

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:08.164
TAKE MEDIC- AND THE REASON FOR

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:09.966
THAT IS THE POOR REIMBURSEMENT

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:12.569
RATE. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:15.105
THAT- N. AS IN THE PANDEMIC

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:17.607
PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THEY LOSE

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:18.508
THEIR ABILITY TO BECOME

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.543
INSURANCE A STATE TRANSITION TO

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:25.148
PUBLIC INSURANCE- AND- THE

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.382
PUBLIC INSURANCE SYSTEM IS

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:29.519
COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY SUCH A

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:30.120
LARGE VOLUME OF PEOPLE AND NOT

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:32.188
ENOUGH. PROVIDERS TO PRIME BY

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:35.391
CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE- SO WHAT

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:37.961
HAPPENS IS THAT WE SORT OF THIS

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:39.963
LIKE. DOUBT YOU KNOW TRICKLE A

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.931
FACT WHERE NOW WE DON'T HAVE

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.166
ENOUGH PROVIDERS BECAUSE NO

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.701
PROVIDERS AREN'T BEING

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.035
REIMBURSED APPROPRIATELY FOR THE

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:48.772
KIND OF CARE- AND THEN WE HAVE

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.807
JUST THIS HUGE SORT OF BACKLOG

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:53.510
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. UNABLE TO GET

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:56.379
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WITHIN A

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:57.680
TIMELY MANNER. AND SO IT JUST TO

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.883
STIR BACK THAT INCREASE OUR

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.818
REMEMBER RATES FOR VERY AT FOR

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:04.354
THE THAT MAKE IT. AT CARE MORE

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.490
ACCESSIBLE WOULD BE GREAT. YEAH

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.192
I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE AND ONE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:11.194
OF THE BENEFITS OF TELEHEALTH IS

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.196
THAT WHERE WE HAVE- DESERT'S OF

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:15.064
MEDI CAL PROVIDERS OR PROVIDERS

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:17.700
GENERALLY W CAN PROVIDE. CARE

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:18.835
AT A. DISTANCE WHICH IS VERY

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.637
NICE BECAUSE I THINK AS SHOWN

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.907
AND DR. ALICIA ALICIA IS MAP

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:25.608
RIGHT WE KNOW WE HAVE DOZENS OF

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.610
KAREN CALIFORNIA- AND AREAS

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.178
WHERE WE HAVE LESS PROVIDERS

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.846
BUT- WE ARE SHORT MEDICAL

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:30.780
PROVIDERS EVERYWHERE SO

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.715
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.450
TO IMPROVE THAT SITUATION. AS WE

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:35.652
INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICARE

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:38.321
WHICH WE DID THIS YEAR. NEED TO

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:39.522
MAKE SURE WERE. INCREASING THE

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.757
PROVIDERS OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.692
OVERWHELM YOU ANY OTHER.

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.227
INCREDIBLE FIGHTERS OUT THERE AT

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.095
BUT ON TOP OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.397
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY HEARING A LOT

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:50.099
ABOUT AND- STAFFING SHORTAGES.

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.969
AT ALL LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT. I'M

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:54.838
AND I'M WONDERING HOW THAT HAS.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:58.007
AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:57:58.074 --> 00:58:00.410
CARE ON TOP OF THE SHORTAGE YOU

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.879
ALREADY MENTIONED- DO YOU WANT

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:05.148
TO. TAKE THAT FIRST STEP

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:08.651
DECISIONS. SURE AND WE HAVE HAD

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:10.053
SOME PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL STAFFING

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:12.689
SHORTAGES AS YOU MENTIONED WHAT

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:14.591
THE PHENOMENON THAT'S HAPPENING

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.526
RIGHT NOW AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:20.563
IN THE NEWS IS BAD- IN AREAS

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.332
THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY COALBED.

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:24.334
THERE ARE OFFERING HUGE

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.537
INCENTIVES FOR NURSES TO TRAVEL

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.472
NURSES TO GO THEIR WORK FOR

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:31.174
SHORT PERIODS OF TIME GET PAID

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.710
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY-

00:58:33.776 --> 00:58:34.777
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PULLING AWAY

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:38.882
FROM OUR OUR- STAFF NURSES- AT

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.483
MOST OF OUR HOSPITALS. SO WHAT

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.918
HAPPENS IS WE HAVE MAJOR

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.786
STAFFING SHORTAGES ON OUR LABOR

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.555
AND DELIVERY FLOOR OPERATING

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:48.691
ROOMS AND WE ARE HUGELY LIMITING

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:49.859
THE AMOUNT OF CARE THAT WE CAN

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:53.363
PROVIDE FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS-

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:55.331
CURRENTLY WE'RE LIMITED TO THAT

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:56.833
WE HAVE THIS. AT JUST TO GIVE

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.668
SOME BACKGROUND SO SOMETHING

00:58:58.735 --> 00:58:59.736
THAT HAPPENS- DURING THE

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:04.007
PANDEMIC WAS THAT- NON ESSENTIAL

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.909
SURGERIES NON EMERGENT SURGERIES

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.277
BOARD THE LATEST OF THINGS THAT

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.579
WERE DEEMED ELECTIVE SURGERIES-

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:12.448
FOR EXAMPLE- AS- THE WOMEN WHO

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:15.251
HAS- REALLY REALLY HEAVY

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:17.420
MENSTRUAL BLEEDING. I'M TO THE

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:18.321
POINT WHERE SHE BECOMES ANEMIC

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.789
NEEDS MULTIPLE BLOOD

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.492
TRANSFUSIONS- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.160
NOT LIFE THREATENING- AND

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.862
OVERALL SHE'S STABLE SHE'S GOING

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.931
TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER YOU

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.699
KNOW. THINGS HAVE BOOSTED UP

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:31.234
WITH A PANDEMIC TO BILL TO GET

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.468
HER SURGERY FORTUNATELY

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.003
UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S NOT THE ONLY

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.438
ONE WHO HAD THAT ISSUE THERE ARE

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.707
JUST SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:40.243
HAD THAT ISSUES OUR BACKLOG AS-

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.245
YOU KNOW- NOT EMERGENT CASE

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:46.182
SAYS. HAS JUST EXPANDED- AND NOW

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:48.551
WE ARE FURTHER CONTACTED BY THIS

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.386
LACK OF ALL OUR STAFF. AND

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.688
THAT'S KIND OF CONTRACT IN THE

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.523
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WERE ABLE TO

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:55.725
OPERATE SO FOR EXAMPLE MY

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:57.660
OPERATING ROOM CAN ONLY FUNCTION

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.429
FROM SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.564
TELL- THREE IN THE AFTERNOON

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.800
WHEN NORMALLY WE CAN GO BEYOND

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:04.367
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A SHIFT

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.436
CHANGE AND THEN. AT THREE PM WE

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.037
HAVE TO CUT DOWN TO ONLY THREE

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.172
OPERATING ROOMS FOR THE ENTIRE

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.641
HOSPITAL SO. IT BECOMES

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.842
CHALLENGING THAT WAY BECAUSE WE

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.444
HAVE NOT ONLY THIS HUGE BACKLOG

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.679
BUT THEN ON OUR SIDE OF THINGS

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.247
WHERE FURTHER CONTRACTED AND HOW

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.683
MUCH WE'RE ABLE TO GIVE BECAUSE

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.684
WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:25.521
PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE THAT CARE-

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:26.656
AND SIMILARLY A LABOR AND

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.858
DELIVERY SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:29.959
THREE NURSES FOR THE ENTIRE

PANCREATIC I MEAN YOU NAME IT

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.631
WAS THEIR PATIENTS COULDN'T GET

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.366
IN FOR THE SCREENING AND YOU

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:18.835
KNOW SO WHEN THEY'RE NOT GETTING

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.437
IN FOR THEIR SCREENING OF A LOT

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:22.505
OF THESE CANCERS THAT ARE GOING

CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND THE CANCER

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.451
DIAGNOSIS THAT MAKES A

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:36.986
DIFFERENCE WHICH IS THE EARLY

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:40.990
DIAGNOSTICS. OF CANCER- ANY I'D

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.558
SAY THAT'S REALLY ACROSS THE

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.394
BOARD AND IF I MAY JUST PICK UP

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.129
ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:49.732
EARLIER- KAREN EXISTENCE I THINK

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.868
THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:55.138
MINDSET- THAT WE'VE HAD FOR SUCH

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.206
A LONG TIME A MEDIINE WHICH IS

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.542
FOCUSED ON DISEASE MANAGEMENT

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.043
DISEASE KAREN'S ADVANCED STAGES

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.178
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE ALL

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:04.113
TRAINED AS NURSES AND DOCTORS TO

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.249
TAKE CARE OF THE END STAGE. AND

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.451
YEAH- AS I MOVED THROUGH MY

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:11.621
CAREER- I'M REALIZING NOW THAT

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.222
WE NEED TO PICK HIM UP EARLY

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.590
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.859
HAVE A REAL IMPACT NOT ONLY ON

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:17.493
THEIR LIVES THAT CAN IMPACT THE

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.229
DOLLARS SO IF I CAN IDENTIFY IT

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:25.434
THIS THIS. WOMAN- THIS PATIENT.

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.104
WHAT WE- MINUTES ONE. CORRECT

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.473
OKAY. YOU CAN SAY THE- YOU SAVE

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.475

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.976
HOSPITALS THE GET BACK TO THE

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.811
SAME THING HOLDS TRUE. COMEDY I

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:39.615
GOT AND YEAH- YOU MENTIONED AS

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:41.651
FOR THE SIMPLEST YOU KNOW AFTER

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.519
THE ACT SAN THING. AND WE TO K.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.821
THEM EARLY. BECAUSE WE KNOW CO

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.590
OF IT. AND THIS IS FOR MUCH

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.759
ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT IF WE

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.694
DON'TCATCH THEM EARLY AND WE

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.462
DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.731
TO IDENTIFY THEM. THEN THEY SHOW

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:58.034
UP LATE AND THEY SHOW UP LATE.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.435
AS- THAT'S TO DIE HE SAID IN THE

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.237
EMERGENCY ROOM WITH UNCONTROLLED

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.940
DIVE DIABETES. AND THAT'S WHEN

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.575
IT GETS TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:08.911
SO THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.913
CIRCLING BACK IS YES WE HAVE

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.517
SEEN A DROP IN DIAGNOSIS- FOR

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.519
DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND WE'RE

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.521
SEEING THEM SHOWING UP LATE- IN

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.189
LATE STAGES OF CANCER. AND

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.557
THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD IN THIS

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.592
IS WHAT THIS IS WHERE IT BREAKS

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:27.597
YOUR HEART BECAUSE. YOU KNOW YOU

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.264
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THAT IS

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:30.066
YOUR- IT'S ALTHOUGH ALASKA

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.100
FOLLOW UP QUESTION ALONG THE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.902
THEME MY CAR. WHICH IS DO ANY OF

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.503
YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.305
FOR HOW WE CAN HELP ENSURE

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.674
CALIFORNIANS ARE GETTING THAT

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.208
EARLY SCREENING AND EARLY

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:41.010
DETECTION. YOU KNOW I SAW THAT

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.878
YOU WENT TO GEORGETOWN AT MADAM

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.447
CHAIR AND I WENT TO GEORGETOWN

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.648
TO AND YOU KNOW YOU NEVER ASK

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.483
YOUR TOP. IN IT YOU HAVE ANY

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.619
ADVICE. AND THE ANSWER IS OF

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:52.788
COURSE WE DO- SO I THINK THAT.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:53.689
FOR ME IT'S CHANGING THE

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.791
MINDSET. AND WE NEED TO GET

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.960
PEOPLE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.929
PREVENTION. I AND WE SAW THAT

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.330
HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUT THAT'S A

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.065
BIG STEP. I THINK IT'S

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.867
PREVENTION EARLY DIAGNOSIS

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.503
SCREENING ACCESS AND DOING THE

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.604
SIMPLE THINGS REALLY REALLY

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.640
WELL. WE GET FOCUSED ON ON THE

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.908
HOSPITAL BASED WORKERS THAT SEXY

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:13.876
THAT'S WELL THAT'S SUPER

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:16.279
EXPENSIVE. BUT I BELIEVE THAT

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:18.447
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH BY. THAT'S NOT

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:19.348
WHERE YOU MAKE THE BIGGEST

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.449
IMPACT CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.251
IMPACT AT THE FRONT END. SO

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.220
CHANGING OUR MINDSET. FOR

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.554
SCREENING FOR HIM WELL WHEN THEY

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:26.722
WON CITIES FOR COLORECTAL

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:30.359
CANCER- GET THE GET THE PATIENTS

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.528
BEFORE THE KIDNEYS ARE DESTROYED

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.530
BY DIABETES OR OR THEIR EYES ARE

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.899
DESTROYED BY DIABETES. GET THEM

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:37.933
BEFORE THEY SHOW UP WITH PELVIC

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.368
ABSCESSES BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.037
BEEN DIAGNOSED. AND I THINK

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.571
THAT'S THAT'S WE NEED TO SHIFT

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:45.174
THE CONVERSATION. TO A MORE

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.575
EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION OF

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.511
SCREENING RESOURCES AND THEN.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:53.783
THE ABILITY. TO FOLLOW THOSE

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:57.787
PATIENTS UP. THE YOU RESPOND.

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.221
ALONG WITH LINES AND I THE

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.856
REPHAIM FREE FRAME OF ONE CARE

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:03.359
TO DISTANCE AND FOCUSING MORE ON

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:06.262
A PREVENTATIVE CARE IN THAT

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.531
DURING THE PANDEMIC AT BECAUSE

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.800
OF THE INCREDIBLE JOB LOSSES

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:13.502
THAT MANY EXPERIENCED- I'M SURE

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.371
THAT THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.972
NEEDED TO GET ON TO MEDICARE ALL

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:19.241
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY I

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:21.777
WONDER- AND I THINK THAT DOCTOR

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.846
AT. A LATER THIS MIGHT BE A

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.716
QUESTION FOR YOU- I WONDER IF TO

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.551
THE EXTENT TO WHICH AT THE

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.619
MEDICAL SYSTEM AS IT IS SET UP

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:33.689
RIGHT NOW- IT IS ADOPTING ENOUGH

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.324
THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU SUGGESTED

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.159
AROUND A FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:40.262
CARE SCREENING AND- AND TESTING

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:43.199
AND WATCH- WHAT IF ANYTHING YOU

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:45.601
MIGHT AT ARE THERE OTHER FOR

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.636
DOCTORS TO TASIA OR- A MYSTERY

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.505
THAT MIGHT SUGGEST WE NEED TO

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:54.710
FOCUS ON. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. MORE TESTING PREVENTATIVE CARE

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:58.748
. THIS IS A SURPRISE. UM I HAD

01:06:58.814 --> 01:06:59.849

THAT THEY'RE DOING AND I HAVE

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.469
SOME IDEAS ON THAT BUT IF I MAY

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.271
I THINK IT BE MORE OKAY. I

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:23.572
ALWAYS LIKE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE

A FULL LOAD OF PATIENTS IN THE

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.852
CLINIC I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.854

AND NATURALLY DELAYED ROUTINE

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.355
HEALTH CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.024
LEADS TO FEWER SCREENINGS AND

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:17.326
MORE. AND IN HIGHER INFECTION

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.595
RATE SO WHEN WE LOOK AT LIKE THE

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.298
CDC REPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:23.833
THE GRADUAL INCREASE EVERY YEAR

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.401
LIKE FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.403
SYPHILIS BASED UP WILL BE NO.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.338
AND WITH LESS SCREENING VISITS

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.574
THIS. IS NOT YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.942
LIKELY TO BE THE CASE FOR TWENTY

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:33.876
TWENTY AS WELL AS WE'RE GONNA BE

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.611
GETTING MORE TREATMENT. AND MORE

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.980
MANAGING AS THE LACK OF CARE

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:39.348
THAT WEREMADE WERE SEEN DURING

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.450
THE PANDEMIC AND THIS COULD

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.751
THEORETICALLY BE APPLIED TO

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.453
OTHER AS GIANT SECTION RATES

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.522
LIKE ON EVERY INCLUDE MEDIA. SO

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:47.423
FOR EXAMPLE PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.825
COMPLETED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.995
LESS AS TI TEST IN FISCAL YEAR

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:53.629
TWENTY ONE THAN WE DID IN FISCAL

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.365
YEAR TWENTY. SO WHAT I THINK IS

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:58.834
THAT AND YOU IN GENERAL GENERAL

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.102
FUND ENOUGH FOCUSES ON THE

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.570
IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:03.472
SCREENING AND PILOTING NEW

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:04.807
TESTING METHODS LIKE I'D MENTION

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.877
PRIOR- WHETHER IT BE IN CLINIC

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:10.346
RAPID TESTING ARE. LEVERAGING AT

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.014
HOME TESTING SELF COLLECTION AND

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.015
MAKING THAT MARK SACHS

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:18.821
ACCESSIBLE FOR PATIENTS AND.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:19.421
EDUCATING THEM ON THE NEED FOR

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.956
IT. WOULD BE SENT IT WOULD BE

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:26.896
IMPORTANT. SO IF I MAY UM I'LL

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.898
PICK UP ON THE AT HOME AND THE

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:30.799
PATIENT SERVICE CENTER WE ONE OF

BECAUSE THE WORKER. IT'S HARD

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.903
TRANSPORTATION ANY NUMBER OF

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.639
REASONS- YOU KNOW THEY CAN GO TO

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.608

NEXT YEAR WILL BE MOVING INTO A

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.981
HOME COLLECTION. AND THEN WE

HAVING THIS DISCUSSION OF BETTER

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:30.059
ALIGNED OF REESE. AND FOCUSING

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:32.428
ON ON PREVENTION. OUT WILL GO A

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.196
LONG WAY TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE

BLACK PARTY PEOPLE RIGHT- AND SO

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.243
THE ACTION PROJECT IS THE FIBER

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:31.579
ONCE BEFORE AND THAT IS OUR

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:33.281

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.723
REFLECTIVE JUSTICE FACULTY FOR

CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS HUGE AND

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.461
THEN THE NEXT ONE I HAD WAS A

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:48.663
BEAUTIFUL SLIDE THAT DEFINED

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.564
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO MEAN

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:52.366
REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE- AND IT'S

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.601
HUMAN RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR

A REPRODUCTION AND THAT RIGHT

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.640
CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WHEN ALL

LIVES. AND SO THAT DEFINITION

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.389
THAT FRAMEWORK GROUNDS ALL OF

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:17.491
OUR WORK AND IN THE PUBLIC

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:19.560
HEALTH FIELD THERE IS THIS-

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.329
CONCEPT HEALTH IN ALL POLICIES

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:23.698
RIGHT AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:26.400

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.985
ENSURE THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR AN

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.553
ADVANCE POLICIES THAT ARE

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.488
HOLISTIC. INTERSECTIONAL AND

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:50.057
REFLECT THE BASIC TENETS OF

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:53.160
REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. FROM SO

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:54.328
UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.529
REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:56.697
ORGANIZATIONS THE NEXT SLIDE I

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:59.500
HAD WAS. EXPLAINING IT WAS A

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:02.470
CHART THAT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:03.738
THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.406
MATERNAL HEALTH UP IN

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:08.042
CALIFORNIA. RIGHT AND SO I

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.711
JUXTAPOSED THESE TWO CHARTS ONE

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.747
IS A COMPARISON BETWEEN

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.448
CALIFORNIA AND HOW CALIFORNIANS

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.017
DOING AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:18.619
THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.388
TO OVERALL MATERNAL. HEALTHCARE

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.823
OR MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE AND

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:25.559
THAT CHART ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:27.395
CLAP FOR ITSELF IMPACTS OPENED

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.563
BACK BECAUSE WE ARE DOING SO

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.932
WE'RE FARING BETTER. RATE AS THE

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.634
DATA STANDS THEM THE REST OF THE

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:35.336
COUNTRY AND THEN THE SECOND

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:39.306
CHART THAT I HAVE JUXTAPOSED.

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:41.142
NEXT TO IT ON THIS. ON THE SLIDE

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.477
IF YOU ONLY A- IS A COMPARISON

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.746
RIGHT IT TAKES A CLOSER LOOK OF

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.349
THE STOCKS WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:51.552
COMPARES- BIRTHING PEOPLE OF

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.788
VARIOUS RACES AND WHAT THAT

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:57.358
REVEALS IS YOU KNOW- I'M MORE

01:34:57.425 --> 01:34:58.893
DISCONCERTING AND DISHEARTENING

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:01.662
STORY RIGHT- WE SEE THAT BLACK

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:04.532
WORKING PEOPLE- SUFFERED.

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.934
TREMENDOUSLY RATE THE DISPARITY

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:09.403
IN XP GREEN JUST AT THIS POINT

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.873
AND SO- A RECENT ACTUALLY

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.643
REPORT- BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:16.577
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THAT

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:19.647
WAS JUST RELEASED- IN SEPTEMBER

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:24.351
I BELIEVE- REVEALED THAT BETWEEN

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:24.885
TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:25.486
SIXTEEN THE PREGNANCY RELATED

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:28.489
MORTALITY RATIO FOR BLACK WOMEN

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.925
WAS FIFTY SIX POINT TWO. LIVE

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:33.294
BIRTHS FOUR HUNDRED THAT. FIFTY

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.329
SIX POINT TWO DEATHS PER HUNDRED

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.598
THOUSAND LIVE BIRDS RIGHT- ARM

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.867
AND THAT'S THAT MAKES IT FOUR TO

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:41.102
SIX TIMES THAT OF OUR

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:42.937
COUNTERPARTS RIGHT AND THIS

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:45.239
NUMBER IS UP FROM FORTY FIVE

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:49.777
POINT THREE. DEATHS PER HUNDRED

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:52.279
THOUSAND LIVE BIRTHS FROM TWENTY

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:52.847
ELEVEN TO TWENTY THIRTEEN SO

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:55.116
WHAT THAT REVEALS RIGHT THESE

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.183
ARE THE MOST CURRENT NUMBERS

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:58.519
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THIS

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.421
DISPARITY IS WIDENING. AND

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:03.290
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC RATE- AND WE

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:04.758
DO THAT THIS WAS THE CASE

01:36:04.825 --> 01:36:07.661
BECAUSE THE COUNTY WIDE NUMBERS

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:09.730
SORT OF TELL US THIS RATE

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:11.432
DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY YOU ARE

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:13.334
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH OFFER MORE

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.569
RECENT DATA- WE SEE THE

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.304
DISPARITIES ARE EVEN GREATER

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:19.507
THAN. WHAT'S WHAT'S REVEALED

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:21.775
STATEWIDE SO- I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.677
IMPORTANT TO SORT OF POINT THAT

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.813

HEAR IT SO I THINK IT'S SO

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.394
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FACT

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.196
AND THE FACT THAT IT IS ONLY

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:30.864
GOTTEN WORSE DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:31.765
IS PART OF WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.133
CONVERSATION. AND FOR THOSE

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.435
EITHER LISTENING TO THE FIRST

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:35.769
PANEL WHEN DOCTORS WHO TASIA

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.871

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:39.406
DIDN'T SEE CARE DESPITE HER

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:42.776
OVERWHELMING- DIABETES UNTIL

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:43.310
AFTER HALFWAY THROUGH HER

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.579
PREGNANCY WE START TO UNDERSTAND

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:46.814
WHY THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATES

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.382
THESE PROBLEMS AND WE NEED TO.

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:49.583
BE DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.051
POWER TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS GET

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:54.221
ACCESS TO CARE- I HAVE TO SAY I

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:57.591
HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION WHICH IS

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:58.225
YOU STILL HAVE THE SHINGLES THE

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.526
PROGRAM. YOU SAID IT WAS A YEAR

FEEL LIKE HAVING BEEN A PREGNANT

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.864
PERSON. AND SOMEONE WITH

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.833
INCREDIBLE CARE. I DON'T KNOW AN

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:14.375
AMAZING IDEA. READ AGREED

GAP OKAY MA'AM. BUT YOU KNOW IT

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:22.149
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T. LOOK

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:24.284
FOR FIGHTING FOR HOME VISITATION

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.853
. AND I DO THAT'S RIGHT ONE OF

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.221
THE THINGS ARE WELL- I GET MY

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.223
SPELL WHICH WE KNOW AGAIN IT.

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:31.024
THE DATE ON LISTEN. TO DO AS A

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:32.459
SPECIAL FOR WOMEN OF. IS REALLY

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.694
INCREDIBLE AND HOW IT AFFECTS

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:35.462
MATERNAL MORTALITY AND BIRTH

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:39.733
OUTCOMES FOR THE UNBORN- SO. IT

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.203
AT FAN WAY TO PER AUNTIES. WE

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.339

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:50.778
BEGUN TO HIGHLIGHT A LOT OF WHAT

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:53.447
THE PROBLEMS ARE- DURING THE

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:55.716
PANDEMIC AND SO- YOU KNOW AND I

01:40:55.783 --> 01:41:00.554
THINK- SO WE ACT A KIA REALLY

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.522
TALKED AT THE END ABOUT THE

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:02.956
POLICY THAT IS PASSED IN THE

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:05.058
PAST FEW YEARS TARGETED AT THIS

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.194
ISSUE OF ACCESS AND REPRODUCTIVE

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.296
JUSTICE AND I GUESS I WOULD ASK

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:10.631
FOR ANY OF USE OF COMING TO THIS

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:11.799
POINT A PANDEMIC WHERE DOES NOT

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:13.400
OVER BUT WE IN OUR LIVING WITH

01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:14.435
IT AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LIVE

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:16.370
WITH THAT- WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.372
YOU HAVE FOR US FOR WHAT WE'RE

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:20.441
SEEING IN FOR THESE INCREASED-

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.408
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.611
HAPPENING FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY

01:41:24.678 --> 01:41:26.447
WOMEN OF COLOR. WHO ARE BIRTHING

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:31.285
- SO I GUESS I WILL START WITH-

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.053

DO YOU WANT TO START. THANK YOU

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:44.865
. CASH SO MY I DON'T KNOW IF

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:49.203
THIS IS. APPROPRIATE OR IF IT'S

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:51.038
APPROPRIATE BUT EXPEDIENT ENOUGH

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:54.341
BUT I THINK STILL THAT- REALLY

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:56.276
ADDRESSING THESE BEES

01:41:56.343 --> 01:41:57.544
DISPARITIES IN THESE ISSUES

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:02.683
THEIR POLICY IS CRITICAL- AND SO

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:05.853
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:07.721
HAVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.890
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.859
ARMED WITH THEIR EARS TO THE

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.194
GROUND SORT OF INFORMING THE

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:17.364
POLICY ARM RECOMMENDATIONS AND-

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:19.433
IN STORE IN TURN THE LEGISLATION

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:22.369
THAT'S PASSED- IS A CRITICAL

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:25.405
STEP TOWARDS- ADDRESSING THESE

01:42:25.472 --> 01:42:27.407
ISSUES BECAUSE IT. CREATES

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.877
CHANGE ON A SYSTEMS WIDE LEVEL-

01:42:29.943 --> 01:42:32.579
AND CAPTURES A BROADER- SECT OF

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:36.216
THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW AND SO

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.784
FOR ME I THINK I REALLY DO

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:40.220
BELIEVE IN POLICY- INNOVATIVE

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:43.190
POLICY POLICY THAT'S EXPENSIVE-

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:47.494
AND SORT OF PUSHES. DOWN IS

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:49.630
CRITICAL TO REVIEW THE EFFECTING

01:42:49.696 --> 01:42:51.598
CHANGE IN THIS ARENA AND I DON'T

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:55.435

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:56.303
ANSWER OR THAT'S NOT. IS

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:57.471
IMMEDIATE MAN THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.539
MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR BUT I

01:42:58.605 --> 01:43:00.374
REALLY DO BELIEVE IN THE POWER

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.745
OF- INNOVATIVE LEGISLATION TO.

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.480

SINCE THE MID EIGHTIES AND HAS-

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.205
IS EVIDENCE BASED- AND SUPPORTED

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:34.474
BY FEDERAL FUNDING AND THAT IS

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.543
CONFERENCE OF PERSONAL SERVICES-

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.879
WE DON'T OVERSEE IT WELL ENOUGH

01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:41.381
AND- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.183
REAL DEEP DIVE INTO WHAT'S GOING

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:46.253

FOR MEDICAID ALL- PREGNANCIES IN

JANUARY ALL PREGNANCIES WILL BE

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.928
IN MANAGED CARE EXCEPT FOR

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:57.731
UNDOCUMENTED. WHICH DOES CONCERN

01:43:57.798 --> 01:43:59.433
US THAT KIND OF SPLIT HOW WILL

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:00.500
THE CREATED MEDI CAL FOR A

01:44:00.567 --> 01:44:02.035
DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT AS GOOD AS

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:03.804
THE MANAGED CARE WILL THAT BE

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:08.575
THAT PERCEPTION. BUT- S. DOES

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:09.843
THIS DETERMINANTS OF OR WHAT

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:11.945
WE'RE TO ABOUT HERE. THAT IS

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:15.482
WHAT CPSDOES THIS CEDARS PARK-

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:17.484
NEEDS AND SO THE FACT THAT

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:19.386
MANAGED CARE DOES NOT GENERALLY

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.655
THOSE SERVICES. ARE PLANNING FOR

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:25.192

INCLUDE CPS BEING AND THEY DON'T

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.366
REALLY DO IT- SO WE NEED TO WE

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:34.401
NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT- I WOULD

01:44:34.468 --> 01:44:36.303
ALSO SAY THE THINGS I SAID.

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:37.571
DURING THE PRESENTATION RICHARD

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.006
YOU KNOW CUT FEES AND THINGS

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:41.174
LIKE THAT- DELIVERY FOR

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:44.411
CALFRESH- PROVIDE HOME DELIVERY

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:45.212
FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET OUT OR

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:48.715
SHOULD NOT GET OUT- TELL PEOPLE

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:51.184
THAT MEDICARE CONTINUES. EMBRACE

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:53.887
PREGNANCY AND- THEN THE NEED FOR

01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:55.555
NOT NOT TO BE PREGNANT IF

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:56.957
SOMEBODY CHOOSES NOT TO BE AND

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:59.926
SAY YOU CAN GET THAT IT'S OKAY-

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:03.363
BUT- LET'S NOT TURN PEOPLE AWAY

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:05.432

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.768
PROVIDERS AFRAID OF NOT GETTING.

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.469
PAID AND WE SEE THAT WAY WAY WAY

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:10.971
TOO MUCH INTERRUPTIONS IN

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.973
COVERAGE. WHICH SHOULD NOT BE

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.809
HAPPENING BUT THEY DO. AND

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.511

ANYWAY. LET'S LET'S TRY TO SET

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.949
THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF HER.

01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:24.017
BECAUSE I'M SURE THE PROVIDERS

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:25.652
DON'T GET PAID OFF AND IN THE

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:27.654
BIG STEP THEY CAN'T A PRODUCT

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:36.463
THAT WAY. SO YOU KNOW THE ARE

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.765

COLLEGE DEGREE IS MORE LIKELY TO

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:43.810

WE'RE READY TO GO THERE NOW AND

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:49.475
THEY CERTAINLY COULD OPEN UP

HOME BIRTH PRACTICES THEY

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:52.145
CERTAINLY COULD OPEN UP

PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:55:57.116 --> 01:55:59.552
AND THAT WOULD BE FINE- BUT NOT

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:00.720
EVERYBODY WANTS AN OUT OF

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:01.954

INTENTION. THOSE WOMEN BIRTHING

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:10.196
PEOPLE MIGHT NEED TO OR CHOOSE

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:11.297
TO TRANSFER TO A HOSPITAL

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:12.432
SETTING FOR SOME REASON AND THE

01:56:12.498 --> 01:56:13.633
MOST COMMON REASON FOR THOSE

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:16.836
TRANSFERS IS A NATURAL OR FOR

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:19.272

INDEPENDENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.743

OPPOSITION- PERMISSION SO I SEE

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:37.857
I SEE A NEED NOW FOR US TO

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:39.759
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:41.327
MIDWIVES INTO THOSE CRITICAL

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:43.029
ACCESS HOSPITALS IN THOSE

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:47.500
COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:48.534
OBGYN PROVIDER- SO THAT DON'T

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.469
HAPPEN. OR COMMUNITIES THAT

01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:51.804
DON'T HAVE- MIDWIVES WHEN THERE

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.940
ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO PREFERMENT

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:55.475
WITH FREE CARE. ABOUT THEM

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:57.243
ANOTHER THING I'M HEARING IS

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.746
MEDIC HOW. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:02.448
OUR ASSOCIATION IS WORKING ON. A

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:03.916
GRISLY RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:05.918
FORTUNATE TO BE INVOLVED IN A

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:06.753
MIDWIFERY LEARNING

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:09.155
COLLABORATIVE- WE WERE SELECTED

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:11.691
AS ONE OF FIVE STATES. TO WORK

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:13.960
ON A PROGRAM TODAY INCREASING

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.762
ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY SERVICES

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:17.530
THROUGH MEDICARE ALL AND ONE OF

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:19.565
THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT'S COME UP

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:20.767
FOR US OVER AND OVER AND OVER

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:23.469
AGAIN ITS REIMBURSEMENT- A

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:25.638
SEQUESTER WAS PUT INTO PLACE I

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.940
WANT TO SAY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN-

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:30.943
WHERE PROVIDERS. HAD THEIR

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:32.278
MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT REDUCED

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:34.414
BY ABOUT 10% AND THAT WAS

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.548
REVERSED FOR A POSITION

01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:37.216
COLLEAGUES- BUT IT HASN'T BEEN

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:39.886
FOR MIDWIVES AND SO WHILE IT IS

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:40.553
HARD TO GET MEDICAL

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.889
REIMBURSEMENT. PERIOD THAT'S AN

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:45.491
ISSUE. IT'S EVEN MORE OF AN

01:57:45.558 --> 01:57:46.893
ISSUE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:49.462
MADE WITH FREE ACCESS- AND

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:52.131
MIDWIFERY REIMBURSEMENT BEING

REDUCED RIGHT NOW SOTHAT'S-

01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:55.334
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE

01:57:55.401 --> 01:58:00.873
LEGISLATURE COULD ACT THEY COULD. ACT TO- INCREASE OR TO MOVE

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.909
THAT'S A QUAESTORS THAT MIDWIVES

01:58:02.975 --> 01:58:04.777
. ARE REIMBURSED FULLY AS OUR

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:07.213
PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES ARE- AND

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.982
THERE BUT THERE WILL. AND HEREBY

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:12.385
INCREASE ACCESS TO MIDWIFERY

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:16.456

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:19.225
BIRTHING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:22.495
THE OTHER THING I'M HEARING IS-

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:25.698
INCREASING OUR WORKFORCE RIGHT-

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.700

FOR THE MOM THE BEST AND- ONE OF

01:58:36.108 --> 01:58:38.177
THE THINGS THAT THAT. THAT BILL

01:58:38.244 --> 01:58:41.681
DID WAS CREATE A MIDWIFERY

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:44.383
WORKFORCE TRAINING FUNDS- AND

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.785
THAT WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:49.856
GEARED TOWARD BRINGING MIDWIVES

01:58:49.922 --> 01:58:51.491
TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:52.692
TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:57.830

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:04.337
VERSIFI ANYTHING THAT'S AN

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.138
IMPORTANT THING TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

01:59:06.205 --> 01:59:08.975
THAT- ADDITIONALLY IF YOU GO

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.810
BACK A FEW HUNDRED YEARS.

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.845

OWN MIDWIVES- AND IT WASN'T

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:24.724
UNTIL. THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:26.225
VARIOUS PROCESS SEES A

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:29.195
CONVERSATION- THAT MIDWIFERY WAS

01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.596
ELIMINATED AND THEN IT WAS

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:32.398
BROUGHT BACK BUT ONLY WHITE AND

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:33.766

02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:33.919
BEEN A BIRTHING PERSON I CANNOT

02:01:33.986 --> 02:01:35.688
IMAGINE BEING ALONE IN THAT

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:37.523
MOMENT I'M BEING TO ADDICT ABLE

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:38.691
TO ADEQUATELY ADVOCATE FOR

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:41.360
MYSELF- SO OBVIOUSLY THAT COMES

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.294
TO MIND BUT I ALSO WONDER

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:44.130
COMMUNICATIONS YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:46.432
MENTIONED IN THE PRIOR PANEL AND

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:47.433
HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON I'M HERE

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:50.369
IS- REALLY THEY NEED TO BUILD

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:53.239
TRUST BETWEEN THOSE WHO THAT ARE

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:54.340
IN NEED OF CARE WHO ARE

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:57.543
ACCESSING CARE AND PROVIDERS AND

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.812
I THE COMMUNICATIONS- FROM THE

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.414
GOVERNMENTS HOPING DURING THE

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.315
PANDEMIC. I WONDER HOW THEY HAVE

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:06.385
AFFECTED- YOU KNOW CARE AND THE

02:02:06.452 --> 02:02:08.154
ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE CARE

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:10.322
SO I JUST REALLY IF- I DON'T

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:11.424
KNOW WHO WANTS TO START WITH

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:12.992
THAT MAYBE I MISSED YOUR IDEA IF

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.093
YOU WANT TO LEAD THE

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:15.795
CONVERSATION ON THAT BUT I WOULD

02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:18.964
REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WE HAVE

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:21.367
DONE. THE GOVERNMENT. I'M WELL.

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:22.568
IT'S ALSO TO. SOLD THE

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:26.539
GUIDELINES. AT NECESSARILY I GAS

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:27.907
HAVE FALLEN SHORT WITH THE

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:29.575
SPORADIC AND DELAYED

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:31.877
IMPLEMENTATION WHICH YOU KNOW

02:02:31.944 --> 02:02:33.245
GRACIOUSLY BEGIN KNOWLEDGE NONE

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.680
OF THIS IS NEVER BEEN THROUGH

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:35.981
THIS BEFORE NONE OF US HAVE DONE

02:02:36.048 --> 02:02:39.085
AB HE A PANDEMIC BEFORE IT NOT

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:41.120
POLICYMAKERS AND NOT THE SCIENCE

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:45.191
THEY RELY ON. AND IT CAN'T

02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:48.661
HAPPEN FASTER THAN THIS. THEIR

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:51.263
VIRUS. ADAM HAS REAL LIFE

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:52.932
IMPACTED BUT FOR ME THAT THE

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.634
FAILURE IS WHERE IT POLICIES

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:58.971
CHANGE MIDSTREAM- EVEN I'VE I'VE

02:02:59.038 --> 02:03:00.473
BEEN AT A BIRTH FOR THE POLICY

02:03:00.539 --> 02:03:03.509
CHANGED WHILE I WAS THERE LIKE

02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:06.178
THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR. BEING

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:06.912
WITH THAT FAMILY CHANGED A LOT I

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:10.649
WAS THERE- AND SO OVER AND OVER

02:03:10.716 --> 02:03:12.618
AGAIN. WE DO OUR PART WE HAVE A

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:13.986
FAMILY CALL BEFORE YOU GET THERE

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:15.788
AND ASK WHAT THE POLICIES ARE

02:03:15.855 --> 02:03:17.757
FOR VISITORS CALL WHEN YOU'RE

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.024
LABOR STARTS TO ASK WHAT THE

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:21.127
POLICY IS ASK THEM WHEN YOU GET

02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:21.761
THERE ASK THEM WHEN YOU HAVE THE

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:24.730
BABY AND- AS OFTEN AS NOT. IT'S

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.632
A DIFFERENT ANSWER EVERY TIME-

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:29.101
AND THAT'S NOT JUST GOVERNING

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:30.269
BODIES POLICIES THAT

02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:31.871
ADMINISTRATION OF HOSPITALS

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:33.472
THAT'S YOU KNOW SUBJECTIVE AND

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.608
OBJECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION-

02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:36.809
DEPENDING ON THE MOOD OF

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:39.879
APHORISMS SHIFT AT THE TIME. AND

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:43.249
EVERYBODY IS OVERWHELMED. AND

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:45.151
THAT OVERWHELM IS VALID FOR

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:47.253
EVERYBODY BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:48.454
TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF HIM AND

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.589
BEING OUT OF THEIR BODY IN THE

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:55.060
MIDST OF IT AND SO I THINK THAT.

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:58.230
THAT AND- ABOUT LACK OF REVIEWS

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.331
ON THE ONE HAND TO BE ABLE TO

02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:00.833
IMPLEMENT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AS

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:02.568
A PERSON WE TALK ABOUT AUTONOMY

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:03.636
WE TALK ABOUT BEING ABLE

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:06.739
ADVOCATE FOR OUR OWN BODIES. AND

02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:10.342
THAT SHOULD INCLUDE. YOUR BIRTH

02:04:10.409 --> 02:04:12.311
TEAMS RIGHT I MEAN I SHOULD BE

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:13.746
AT THE TOWARD THE TOP OF THE

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:15.114
LIST TUESDAY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:17.583
HAVE. YOUR BABY AND IT JUST IT

02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:19.485
BEATS THE TRAUMA THAT ALREADY

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:21.253
THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN ARE

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.322
ALREADY AFRAID LIKE WHEN I

02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:26.058
STARTED. BEING A DELAY EVEN IN

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.293
TWENTY NINETEEN BEING A DOULA

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:28.494
WHEN I INTERVIEWED APPLYING IT

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:30.029
YOU KNOW AND I SAY WHAT MAKES

02:04:30.095 --> 02:04:32.031
YOU WANT THE SERVICE. AND THEY

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.165
WOULD HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YOU

02:04:33.232 --> 02:04:35.134
EXPECT I WANT TO NATURAL BIRTH

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:36.702
OR I WANT SOMEBODY THERE WHO

02:04:36.769 --> 02:04:38.537
CAN. GIVE ME MY OPTIONS OR I

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:40.039
WANNA MAKE GOOD DECISIONS OR I

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:42.374
WANT SOMEONE TO HELP MY PARTNER

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:44.410
HELPED ME HAVE THIS BABY. AND

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:46.278
THIS YEAR LAST YEAR THE ANSWER

02:04:46.345 --> 02:04:50.416
WAS I JUST DON'T WANT TO DIE.

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.785
THAT WAS STOPPING HEART. WHEN

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:55.187
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS THIS

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:56.488
THIS THING IN THE SHIFTING

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:58.924
POLICIES TAKE AWAY THE MAGIC OF

02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:00.759
THOSE INITIAL MOMENTS WHEN MOMS

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:02.194
ARE AFRAID TO TAKE A CO THAT

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:03.963
TEST NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:04.964
THEY'RE SICK BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:06.398
AFRAID IF IT HAPPENS TO TURN UP

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.200
POP POSITIVE DOES THAT MEAN I'M

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:09.435
GOING TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:11.203
BABY DOES THIS MEAN I GET TO

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.605
BREAST FEED MY BABY DOES THIS

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:13.806
MEAN SOMEBODY'S GOING TO CALL

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:15.441
THE PEOPLE ON ME IF I DECLINE

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:17.443
THIS TEST BECAUSE I WANT TO STAY

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:20.145
WITH MY BABY. WHAT IS THAT THAT

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.413
LOOKED LIKE AND SO ANY TIME YOU

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.349
SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS WORKING

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:25.284
WITH A FAMILY AND GUIDING THEM

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.518
THROUGH PLANNING THEIR LABOR AND

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:27.853
DELIVERY AND THE POSTPARTUM

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.723
BONDING TO SEE THAT BE SNATCHED

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:33.759
AWAY M. IT'S HEARTBREAKING WHEN

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:37.363
THERE ISN'T A RECOURSE AND FOR

02:05:37.429 --> 02:05:38.797
ME NOT BEING ABLE TO BE WITH

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:41.600
THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE AN

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:44.470
ADJUSTMENT. S. S. OR OR RESPONSE

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:46.906
IN REAL TIME TO HAVE TO ADJUST

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:49.008
TO BURCHELL SUPPORT I MEAN HOW

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:50.342
HARD IS IT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:52.811
THROUGH A MASK RIGHT SO YOU'RE

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:53.979
TALKING THROUGH THE MASCULINE

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.547
MATCHING AMASSED WE'RE TRYING TO

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:57.283
DO BREATHING TECHNIQUES I CAN'T

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:59.418
SEE HER FACE FULLY I CERTAINLY

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.719
CAN'T SEE HER FACE FULLY THROUGH

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:04.423
A MASK AM ON FACETIME. ON VIDEO

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:05.758
RIGHT SO THERE'S ALL OF THESE

02:06:05.824 --> 02:06:08.027
THINGS THAT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:14.867
AT YOU KNOW LIKE SOMEBODY AT.

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:15.534
THE TOP DECIDING WHAT STATE. AND

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:16.168
YOU COMPARE THAT TO SOME. WHO

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:17.870
DOWN HERE IN IT IN THE TRENCHES

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:20.172
. AND TRYING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:24.677
WHAT IS. IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN

02:06:24.743 --> 02:06:27.179
THERE'S NOT THAT FLEXIBILITY M.

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:30.149
IT IT IT CAN BE CATASTROPHIC TO

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:32.651
A FAMILY THAT MAY BE. RADULA

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:34.820
ALREADY. AND WE'RE COMING INTO A

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:36.255
SITUATION AND YOU'VE GOT A MOM

02:06:36.322 --> 02:06:37.690
WHO'S ALREADY AFRAID TO HAVE A

02:06:37.756 --> 02:06:40.960
BABY IN A PANDEMIC IN A HOSPITAL

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:43.362
IN BLACK SKIN. AND THEN SHE HAS

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:44.730
TO TELL HER BABY'S FATHER HE

02:06:44.797 --> 02:06:46.498
CAN'T BE THERE SHE HAS TO TELL

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:48.634
HER MOTHER SHE CAN'T BE THERE

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:50.135
FOR HER BEST FRIEND OR HURDLE

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:53.472
THAT LIKE. ALL OF THESE THINGS.

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:54.907
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:56.809
BEEN BREATHING ON HER THE ENTIRE

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:59.578
TIME. SO THERE'S NOT THIS HUGE

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:02.214
INCREASED RISK OF HAVING THEM BE

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:07.419
BY HER. STILL AGAIN RIGHT LIKE

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:09.521
NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH THAT

02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:11.824
AND I THINK THAT THAT. FOR ALL

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:13.325
OF THE GOOD INTENTION THAT THERE

02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:15.561
ARE FOR THE GUIDELINES- AND THEY

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:17.363
MAKE SENSE BIG PICTURE THEY

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:18.864
REALLY REALLY DO I DON'T WANT TO

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.199
BE ON A BUS WITH ANYBODY WITHOUT

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:21.066
A MASK I DON'T WANT TO BE ON A

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:22.634
PLANE WITH ANYBODY WITHOUT A

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:24.436
MASK AND VACCINES AND ALL THAT

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:25.871
THAT MAKES SENSE BUT IN OUR

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:29.675
LITTLE SMALL CIRCLE FAMILY.

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:32.177
BUBBLES OF BIRTH. THERE HAS TO

02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:36.582
BE THAT BAD LIKE STABILITY AND I

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.684
. THE OTHER PART AND THIS IS THE

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:40.219
HARD PART OF THE CONVERSATION

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:41.286
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ALL THE

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:42.588
STATISTICS FOR THE PART THAT

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:43.622
COMES WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT A

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.424
QUESTION WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:47.459
STATISTICS SO FAR OF HOW THIS

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:48.894
THE PANDEMIC AFFECTS PEOPLE AND

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.629
IMPACTS PEOPLE BUT ONE OF THE

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:52.064
THINGS WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:55.300
IS THE MAGNIFYING. THAT A

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:58.470
PANDEMIC HAS PLACED ON BIASES.

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:00.005
THE INCREASE THE ENERGY THE

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:02.908
POWER THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:08.280
WHERE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S BIAS CAN

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.783
TAKE AWAY AN ENTIRE BIRTH PLAN

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:14.219
AND THERE'S NO RECOURSE AND WHEN

02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:17.689
THERE IS A LACK OF. SHARED%

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:19.725
VALUES FROM THE PEOPLE AT THE

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:22.227
TOP WHO WON ALL THE BEST FOR

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:24.229
EVERYBODY AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.197
STRUGGLING WITH THE HANDS ON

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:28.400
CARE- THAT CAUSES DRAMATIC BIRTH

02:08:28.467 --> 02:08:32.171
EXPERIENCES. FOR WORKING

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:37.943
FAMILIES I. HAD. ANDERSON

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:41.447
MINISTRY- WALK INTO A ROOM. WITH

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:43.315
ANOTHER ADMINISTRATOR WHO WAS

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:44.616
NOT A CARE PROVIDER JUST

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:46.251
SOMEBODY WHO WAS PURELY

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:48.454
ADMINISTRATION BE BROUGHT INTO A

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.423
ROOM WHEN A FATHER REQUESTED TO

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:55.127
AT. ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN FILE

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:58.864
AT A REPORT OR A GRIEVANCE WHEN

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.666
THE FAMILIES BIRTH PLAN WAS NOT

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:05.604
FILED. AND EIGHT. THAT POLICY

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:08.407
THAT POPPED UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.

IF THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS

02:28:50.788 --> 02:28:52.456
RACISM I KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S

02:28:52.523 --> 02:28:54.258
REALLY DIFFICULT BUT THAT THERE

02:28:54.325 --> 02:28:56.494
HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL RACISM

02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.130
ESPECIALLY THAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:01.832
SEEN DURING THIS. AND DEMOCRATS-

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:04.635
SOME OF IT IS ALSO A AND IT

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:07.805
INTERACTED WITH HOUSING. FOR

02:29:07.872 --> 02:29:10.341
EXAMPLE THERE IS A- ONE OF OUR

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:13.511
SISTER ORGANIZATIONS IN LA- DATA

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:15.746
CREATING CLIENT AND WHO BETTER

02:29:15.813 --> 02:29:17.982
TO RENT A PLACE- BECAUSE SHE

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.450
WANTED TO LEAVE HER ABUSER SO

02:29:19.517 --> 02:29:20.951
SHE HAD THE FUNDS HER RENTAL

02:29:21.018 --> 02:29:22.553
BACKGROUND WAS FINE SHE THOUGHT

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:23.988
SHE HAD THE LEASE. UNTIL THE

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:26.490
COMPLEX THOUGHT SHE WOULD SPREAD

02:29:26.557 --> 02:29:28.225
CODED BECAUSE SHE WAS ASIAN. SO

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:29.560
NOT HAVING STATE HOUSING

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:31.462
DEFINITELY AFFECTS ONE'S HEALTH

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:34.565
AND WELL BEING. OF OUR EVEN AS A

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:35.866
GUY THAT AFFECTED HAVE A DOUBLE

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:38.135
FEAR WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:40.304
GETTING COLDER. BUT WITH THE

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:42.506
SECOND. PROBLEM BEING BEING

02:29:42.573 --> 02:29:45.643
BLAMED FOR KOBE AND HAVING TO

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.311
DEAL WITH RACISM. HI AND IT

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:48.913
ISN'T ENOUGH THAT THERE IS THAT

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.548
REALITY OF THE FEAR INCOMPETENT

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:53.951
THE COVERED RACISM. THIS IS ALSO

02:29:54.018 --> 02:29:57.755
BEEN- AWAY OF ABUSE BY THEIR

02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:00.091
THEIR ABUSERS- WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:02.193
SEVERAL VICTIMS TELLING US HOW

02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:03.928
THEIR ABUSERS TELL THEM. YOU

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:04.962
KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET

02:30:05.029 --> 02:30:06.263
COOPER THEY'RE GOING TO SPREAD

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.566
COLD WINTER GONNA FACE RACISM

02:30:08.632 --> 02:30:10.334
AND SO IT JUST MAKES IT THAT

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.403
MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO CHANGE

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:15.606
THEIR LIVES TO CALL FOR HELP.

02:30:15.673 --> 02:30:16.841
AND WE'VE ALSO KNOWN THAT

02:30:16.907 --> 02:30:18.042
THERE'S BEEN AN IMPACT

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:19.210
ESPECIALLY ON THE ASIAN PACIFIC

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.579
ISLANDER COMMUNITY. IT BAG

02:30:21.645 --> 02:30:22.747
COMMUNITIES SUFFERED THE MOST

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:24.415
ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE I'VE CALLED

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:28.018
A COUPLE FEARS AND RACISM. THIS

02:30:28.085 --> 02:30:31.188
IS MEANT A LOSS OF JOBS IN OUR-

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:32.056
ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:34.358
COMMUNITIES STRESS ADDITIONAL

02:30:34.425 --> 02:30:37.294
STRESS ON OUR API FAMILIES AND

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:38.496
WE BELIEVE MORE DOMESTIC

02:30:38.562 --> 02:30:41.465
VIOLENCE IN IN OUR HOMES. THE

02:30:41.532 --> 02:30:42.733
VIRUS DIDN'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.135
TOUCH OUR FAMILIES BUT THE

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.536
ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM THE

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:48.472
VERIFIERS MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:49.740
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OUR

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.609
FAMILIES. SO IF THERE'S

02:30:51.675 --> 02:30:52.910
SOMETHING LEGISLATIVE THAT YOU

02:30:52.977 --> 02:30:54.945
COULD HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE WE

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:56.380
KNOW THAT THAT IMPACTED BECAUSE

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.281
IT'S GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY

02:30:57.348 --> 02:30:59.183
REVEALED WHEN FOLKS RETURNED TO

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:00.251
WORKING OUTSIDE THEIR HOMES

02:31:00.317 --> 02:31:02.052
MORE. AND THAT'S WHEN I CRISIS

02:31:02.119 --> 02:31:03.487
CALLS WHICH ONES ARE GOING TO

02:31:03.554 --> 02:31:05.489
SPIKE MARC AND WE NEED TO MAKE

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.826
ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN PLACE AND A

BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THE RISE

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:21.939
SPECIFICALLY IN ASIAN HATE

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:22.873
DURING THE COURSE OF THE

02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.509
PANDEMIC IT'S SOMETHING THAT-

THAT AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITY BUT

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:35.719
IT IS BEEN- DISTINCT. HONOR TO

AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE.

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:42.660
THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:44.261
WE DID PASS QUITE A FEW PIECES

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.729
OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT WE

02:31:45.796 --> 02:31:46.864

02:31:48.365 --> 02:31:49.667
HATE CRIMES WE CAN BETTER TARGET

02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:51.435
THEM BUT IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:52.303
THING AND I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

02:31:52.369 --> 02:31:54.371
ELEVATED IT. BECAUSE IT DOES

02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:55.906
TOUCH EVERY ASPECT OF THE LIVES

02:31:55.973 --> 02:31:56.907
OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE IT

02:31:56.974 --> 02:31:58.876
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.611
AB EXPERIENCING TRAUMA TO

02:32:00.678 --> 02:32:02.780
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THIS

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:07.918
MESSENGER ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD. TO WHAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:10.421
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON. I WOULD

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:13.123
LIKE TO ECHO MUCH OF WHAT- HILDA

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:15.159
HAS ALREADY LIFTED UP WHICH IS

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:17.828
THE NEED FOR CULTURALLY SPECIFIC

02:32:17.895 --> 02:32:20.664
FUNDING- WE ARE WE ARE ONE SUCH

02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:22.266
GRANT WE RECEIVED IT. AT THE

02:32:22.333 --> 02:32:23.901
FEDERAL LEVEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW

02:32:23.968 --> 02:32:25.402
OF ANY AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:27.371
REALLY. ALLOCATE FUNDING

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:29.306
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CHEN C.

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:31.242
CENTER LIKE. MY SISTER'S HOUSE

02:32:31.308 --> 02:32:32.977
THAT ARE- OPERATING WITH THE

02:32:33.043 --> 02:32:35.246
CULTURALLY SPECIFIC PLANS AND

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:38.282
FOCUS. PRECAMBRIAN MICK- AFRICAN

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.951
AMERICAN WOMEN WERE. THREE TIMES

02:32:41.018 --> 02:32:42.753
MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:44.154
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WE

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:47.091
SUSPECT. THAT THAT STATISTIC-

02:32:47.157 --> 02:32:49.159
HAS INCREASED DURING THE

02:32:49.226 --> 02:32:52.563
PANDEMIC. AND WE KNOW THAT-

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:54.398
AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:57.067
PARTICULAR CONCERNS. ABOUT BEING

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:59.904
ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP NOT

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:02.306
IN TRADITIONAL WAYS. AND OUR

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:04.508
ORGANIZATION HAS STOOD AS ONE OF

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:07.278
THOSE SAFE HAVENS WHERE. AFRICAN

02:33:07.344 --> 02:33:08.746
AMERICAN WOMEN IN SOUTH LOS

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.481
ANGELES FELT SAFE TO REACH OUT

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:11.615
FOR HELP. WHEN THEY WERE

02:33:11.682 --> 02:33:12.983
EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:14.451
AND SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE FUNDING

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:16.320
THAT RECOGNIZES THE SPECIAL

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:19.623
ROLE. THAT WE PLAY IN SERVING

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.692
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES- I DID

02:33:21.759 --> 02:33:22.993
TOUCH ON THIS A LITTLE BIT IN MY

02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:28.966
OPENING REMARKS IN TERMS. OF.

02:33:29.033 --> 02:33:30.401
LOOKING AT HOW. FINDING IT YOU

02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:33.637
AND SUCCESS METRICS- SOME OF OUR

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:37.041
CONTRACTS ARE FEE FOR SERVICE SO

02:33:37.107 --> 02:33:38.609
IN OTHER WORDS WE ONLY GET

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:40.377
REIMBURSED UNDER THE CONTRACT

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:42.313
WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO BILL FOR

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:44.548
CERTAIN. SPECIFIC SERVICES SUCH

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:46.750
AS BAD NIGHTS AND IN THE WAKE OF

02:33:46.817 --> 02:33:48.452
THE PANDEMIC THESE METRICS NO

02:33:48.519 --> 02:33:49.753
LONGER MAKES SENSE AND THEY

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.689
DON'T ACCURATELY REFLECT THE

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.257
BREADTH AND SCOPE OF THE WORK

02:33:53.324 --> 02:33:54.525
THAT WE ARE DEALING I'M

02:33:54.592 --> 02:33:55.926
PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:57.227
PANDEMIC AND SO I BELIEVE LIKE

02:33:57.294 --> 02:33:59.163
THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A LOOK

02:33:59.229 --> 02:34:01.198
AT PERHAPS. CRAFTING SOME

02:34:01.265 --> 02:34:05.169
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DO AWAY

02:34:05.235 --> 02:34:07.838
WITH THESE- MEASUREMENT MODELS

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.840
IF YOU WILL THAT WILL HINDER OUR

02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:12.476
ABILITY. AS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:14.378
DO THIS WORK AND TO DO THIS WORK

02:34:14.445 --> 02:34:16.046
IN A WAY THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:18.148
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE

02:34:18.215 --> 02:34:20.351
COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. AND

02:34:20.417 --> 02:34:22.519
THAT CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.555
FUNCTION NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S

02:34:24.622 --> 02:34:26.023
A PANDEMIC OR SOMETHING ELSE

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:28.425
THAT- IMPACTS THE WAY THAT WE DO

02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:31.362
THE WORK SO THAT WOULD BE

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:31.996
SOMETHING I'D ASK LEGISLATORS TO

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:34.798
CONSIDER. IF I MIGHT ADD YOU

02:34:34.865 --> 02:34:36.533
