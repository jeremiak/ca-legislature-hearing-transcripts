TO CALL OUR MEETING TO ORDER. THIS IS THE SECOND MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TODAY I. WE WILL BEGIN WHAT I. EXPECT MAY WELL BE A MULTI YEAR COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INITIATIVES. IN ARE OVERSIGHT ROLE IT IS OUR DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT ONLY FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED. BUT MAXIMIZING THEIR POTENTIAL I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WITH RECYCLING WERE REALLY NOT THERE ON EITHER OF THOSE SCHOOLS. HOWEVER AS POLICY MAKERS AND ELECTED STEWARDS OF THE STATE WE ARE ALSO TAXED WITH INNOVATING AND INSTALLING NEW APPROACHES TO OUR EVER EVOLVING CHALLENGES. WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY. IT'S NO SECRET THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING PROGRAMS NEED REFINEMENT AS I MENTIONED IN FACT FIXES TO THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM MOST COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE. BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN EACH OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN CHAIR. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT ALONG WITH CAP AND TRADE IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE BOTTLE BILL HAS BEEN DISCUSSED MORE THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM. AS PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON FIXES HOWEVER AS POLICY MAKERS WE HAVE A DUTY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND EXAMINE OUR APPROACH TO RECYCLING. AND TAKE A FURTHER STEP BACK AND EXAMINE OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS. LET'S SINGLE OUT JUST ONE OF THE MANY PRODUCTS WE PRODUCE AND CONSUME. PLASTICS. SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES GLOBAL PLASTIC PRODUCTION HAS RISEN FROM TWO MILLION TONS A YEAR TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION TONS. IT'S MUCH BETTER. SHOULD APPLAUD THE LIGHT. ADAM THIS IS PRODUCED MORE THAN SIX POINT THREE BILLION TONS OF PLASTIC WASTE. OF WHICH NINE PERCENT. ONLY NINE PERCENT HAS BEEN RECYCLED TWELVE PERCENT IS INCINERATED WORLDWIDE AND THE REMAINING SEVENTY NINE PERCENT. IS DUMPED INTO LANDFILLS. OR LITTERED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS STAGGERING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE MILLIONS OF BLUE BINS THAT LINE THE STREETS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS EVERYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ON. TRASH COLLECTING DAYS. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE ARE THE STATISTICS? WHAT ALSO STAGGERING IT IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF SOLID COULD FILL AN AREA THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE FEET DEEP? ACTUALLY TO OUR TWENTY NINE FEET AND SEVEN INCHES THIS IS ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR ROLAND DIRE AT THE INSTITUTE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SANTA BARBARA. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THIS PLASTIC WASTE IS ALSO IN OUR OCEANS WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC ON MULTIPLE LEVELS. FIRST PLASTICS ARE NOT HEALTHY FOR OCEANS AND SEE LIFE AND IN TURN NOT HEALTHY FOR US. WELL SALT WATER AND ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT BREAKDOWN PLASTICS. THEY DO NOT DECOMPOSE AS A RESULT. THESE PLASTICS WHETHER THEY'RE CLAMSHELL PACKAGING. COKE BOTTLE STRAWS AND THE LIKE THE BREAKDOWN INTO TINY MICRO PLASTICS IN SOME CASES LIKE MICROBEADS FOUND IN FACIAL SCRUBS AND TOOTHPASTE. WE'LL BE SEEING LESS OF THOSE IN THE FUTURE OR PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS FROM SYNTHETIC CLOSE WE RUN THROUGH OUR WASHING MACHINES. THEY PENNED. DESERT THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE DELIBERATE LEE PRODUCED AS MICHAEL PLASTICS IN A BREAKDOWN THAT'S THOUGH THE WAY THEY'RE PRODUCED. IN ANY CASE. THESE CELL MICROPROCESSOR THAN INGESTED BY FASHION AS THE ECONOMISTS RECENTLY POINTED OUT AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED JUST LAST WEEK. FROM THERE IT SEEMS ONLY A SHORT JOURNEY TO OUR DINNER PLATES. WE ALSO DON'T TYPICALLY SEE PLASTICS THAT ARE IN THE OCEAN SCIENTISTS ESTIMATE THAT OUR OCEANS CONTAIN FIFTY ONE TRILLION MICHAEL PLASTIC PARTICLES AND THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY. THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC ARE OCEAN. FINISH THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. FINALLY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING RATE FOR ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS PLASTIC GLASS AND ALUMINUM. IS DECLINING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS MORE RECYCLING CENTERS CLOSE. THINK ABOUT THAT. AND I REALLY THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOESN'T KNOW. AND AS WORD. BECOMES AS THIS IT DOES BECOME MORE GENERALLY KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED THAT WE'RE NOT ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT THEY ALL EXPECT US TO ACHIEVE. AND COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM EVEN ONE BOTTLES ARE RETURNED TO BE RECYCLED. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BEING RECYCLED AS WE EXPECT MOST PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE THAT MUCH OF WHAT THEY THROW INTO THEIR BLUE BINS. ENDS UP IN THE LANDFILL INCLUDING AS WAS RECENTLY REPORTED TO MY OFFICE COMPLETELY CLEAN RECYCLABLE PLASTIC SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THE PRODUCT. SO CONSUMERS ARE NOT ONLY NOT GETTING THERE NICKEL OR DIME BACK BUT MORE TO THE POINT. THEIR RETURN BOTTLES ARE NOT ACTUALLY PAYING RECYCLED. DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS OF CONSUMERS RECYCLERS REGULATORS AND ADVOCATES AND OTHERS WHO HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN THIS PROGRAM. IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO DO THEIR PART AND RECYCLE TO NOT LABEL THIS PROGRAM AS FAILING. IN ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION AND MISSION. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF ARE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS TODAY NOR WILL WE COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR PRODUCER AND CONSUMER HABITS HOWEVER. I DO EXPECT THAT BY TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR RECYCLING PROGRAMS WE WILL START TO RETHINK THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE LARGER SOLUTION. AND THAT REALLY LOOK AT MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING A GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE. I MET A VERY PLEASED TODAY TO SEE THAT OUR BUDGET CHAIR FELTING IS PRESENT AND TO HE HAS BEEN INTENSELY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE. CHAIR TING DID DO WANT TO ADD SOME COMMENTS. JUST VERY BRIEFLY IT SEEMS THAT DOWN IS JUST ECHO YOUR. YOUR YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR THAT. HOME FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR. GREAT RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND THAT WERE VERY VERY PROUD OF IT THINK WE. I'VE EVER PAPER PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE THAT. SEEMS TO BE THAT WE STRUGGLED TO GET IT ABOVE THE EIGHTY PERCENT THRESHOLD AND IT SEEMS TO COSTS A. B. FLUCTUATING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PERCENT OF THE PLOW. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO. TAKE A STEP BACK IT AND REITERATE THAT OUR GOAL IS NEVER ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT BUT ABOUT ZERO WASTE. THAT IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND IT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT NOT HOW DO WE. AND MAINTAIN THE SOLVENCY OF A PROGRAM THAT KEEPS AT EIGHTY PERCENT BUT WHAT KIND OF PROGRAM DO WE NEED TO HAVE TO GET US TWO HUNDRED PERCENT SO. THAT WITHOUT VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THAT HEARING IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. YOU'RE WELCOME AND VERY WELL SAID THANK YOU SOWE WILL BEGIN. TODAY WITH A A REPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ACTUALLY AIMS. HERE TO PELUSO LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE BOTTLE PRO. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS EVERYONE MACHINES WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DID PREPARE A HANDOUT THAT I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE FOR THE THE SERGEANT I WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU. AND SO THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE A KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW IT'LL MOVE THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY SINCE I KNOW THEIR LOT OF PANELISTS THAT YOU WANT TO GET TO BUT PLEAS FEEL FREE TO. STOP ME ALONG THE WAY. FROM THINGS UNCLEAR YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SO PERSONAL JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CONTAINERS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROGRAM AND HOW WE DETERMINE WHICH CONTAINERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE PART OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. DON'T TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FLOW OF THE CONTAINERS THROUGH PROGRAM AND THE EXCHANGE OF THE. REDEMPTION VALUE ABOUT MONETARY VALUE THAT'S TIED TO THOSE CONTAINERS. THIRD ALSO GOT SO THE OUTCOMES SPECIFICALLY THE RECYCLING RATES OVER TIME AND I KNOW YOU TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON THE RECENT TRENDS THERE. ALREADY AND FORTH SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAM EXPENDITURES THAT THEY SUPPORT BESIDES JUST THE BASIC CRV PAYMENTS FOR THE CONTAINERS. A FIFTH THE STATUS OF THE FIND. ON THE MAIN FUND FOR THE PROGRAM AND THEN LASTLY SOME OF THE THE RECENT RECYCLING CLOSURES. SO IF YOU LOOK ON THE FIRST PAGE. THIS FIGURE JUST SHOWS HOW WE DETERMINE WHICH CONTAINERS ARE ACTUALLY PART THE PROGRAM. IN THE SEA HAS TO DO WITH SIZE OF THE MATERIAL TYPE AND WHAT THE CONTENT OF THE CONTAINER IS MADE UP OF. IRELAND AND THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS AS YOU CAN SEE THERE. WELL MOST OF THINGS THE PROGRAM WATER BOTTLES SODA CAN YOUR BOTTLES ON THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT THEY ARE USED TO PAY YOUR SCARY FOR. A SOLUTION YOU TURN THE NEXT PAGE. AND THAT'S THE FLOW OF THE CONTAINER PAYMENT SO. AROUND THE OUTSIDER CODE THE MAIN OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND YOU CAN SEE AT EACH STAGE OF THE CONTAINER CHANGES HANDS. THEN THERE'S USUALLY SOME KIND OF OF A PAYMENT THAT CHANGES THAT WELL AS WELL. I'M CONSUMERS PAY THEIR DEPOSIT WHEN THE A AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE I MEAN THE WAY THAT. THE PROGRAM WORKS IS WE INCENTIVIZE THEM TO BRING ABOUT JUSTIFIED RECYCLER BY. REFUNDING THAT TO THEM. WHEN THEY DO THAT. IF YOU TURN TO THE THIRD PAGE THEN. YOU CAN SEE THAT OVER TIME THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL AT. A BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING ESPECIALLY FROM THE BEGINNING. NOTABLY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND YOU SEE BIG DROP. BUT THE P. ET THAT WAS WHEN I WATER BOTTLES BEGAN. OF THEIR INCLUSION IN SO YOU CAN SEE THE RATE WAS MUCH LOWER AND THEN CLIMBS AGAIN OVER TIME. BUT AS THE CHAIR NOTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE RECYCLING RATES. FROM THAT CAN BE A TO REACH MANY FACTORS BUT I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT CERTAINLY CAN BE RELATED TO SOME OF THE RECENT RECYCLING CENTER CLOSURES. OF SOFT TOUCH ON THAT HERE IN A MOMENT. TURNING TO THE FOURTH PAGE. THE PROGRAM ALSO STRIDES SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF OTHER ACTIVITIES BESIDES JUST THE EXCHANGE OF CONTAINERS AND SERIES. AS YOU CAN SEE AND THE WAY THE THOUGHT IS FUNDED IS ESSENTIALLY THROUGH A CRV THAT'S NOT CLAIMS SO RECYCLING RATE IS ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT THAT MEANS YOU'RE ONLY PAYING OUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHAT WAS PAID IN. THE OTHER TWENTY PERCENT GOES TOWARDS THESE VARIOUS. OTHER PROGRAMS I WON'T GOING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY. WHAT THE OF THOSE HAPPY TO TOUCH ON THOSE? IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE FIVE. AND THE SALUTE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT MAYBE THAN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE SUB COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT THE STATUS. OF THE PROGRAM FINANCIALLY AND ITS VARIOUS FUNDS. WHICH IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SURPLUS PROJECTED FOR. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND WE'VE BEEN IN YOUR LOT BECAUSE OF. TALKING ABOUT DEFICITS BUT SINCE THE RECYCLING RATE OF HAS DECLINED OF ONE PERCENT DECLINE IN THE RATE IS MORE THAN I'M TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S. STAYING IN THIS PROGRAM AND SO BECAUSE IT'S GONE DOWN A LITTLE BIT. AMONGST OTHER THINGS WE SEE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY. THIS YEAR. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE'S MORE MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE THERE'S LESS RECYCLING GOING ON. THAT IS WHAT THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. ONE OF THE. AND THEN FINALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST PAGE. JUST TOUCHING ON SOME OF THE RECYCLING CENTER CLOSURES. SINCE THE PEAK WOULDN'T WE HAD THE MOST RECYCLING CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. A ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED SENATORS THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED FEWER CENTERS REGISTER OF COLOR CYCLE TODAY THAN THERE WERE AT THAT TIME. WHICH IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. VARIOUS REASONS BUT THE MAIN ONES THAT WE FOUND WHERE THE REDUCE RECYCLER REVENUES DUE TO AND THEN THE. REALLY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN SCRAP VALUE THAT WE SAW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SOME RECYCLERS DID SAY INCREASED OPERATING COSTS TIED TO THINGS LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE ON SOME INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THAT KIND OF THING. AND THEN FINALLY THAT SOME OF THE THE PAYMENT FORMULAS COMING OUT OF THE PROGRAM WERE ABLE TO KEEP. PACE WITH SOME OF THOSE MORE QUICK MARKET CHANGES. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SMALL ROLE RECYCLERS WERE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED LIKELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGHER PER CONTAINER COST PER TRANSPORTATION COSTS UNUSUALLY LESS ECONOMIES OF SCALE. ETCETERA. IN THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR SEVERAL REASONS THAT REDUCES CONSUMER CONVENIENCE TO GET THERE ARE. DEPOSIT BACK. IT CAN INCREASE RETAILER COST THE RETAILER HAS A START TAKING THOSE CONTAINERS BACK OR PAYING THE. HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THE OF THE PROGRAM THEIR SPECIFIC PAYING. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A RECYCLE THEIR NOT TO IN THE CONTAINERS BACK. AND THEN FINALLY THAT POTENTIALLY FEWER RIGID CONTAINERS ARE BEING RECYCLED. BECAUSE THE SALAS CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE. TO BRING THE RECYCLING AND SAYS YOU NOTED THAT THE RATE HAS DROPPED TO. CLOSE TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT AND NOW WE'RE WE'RE ROUGHLY AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT. SO THEN FINALLY JUST TO CONTINUE THAT. THE STATE HOUSING AT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. THE FIRST ONE IS WE DO HAVE A BILL LAST YEAR THAT. AUTHORIZED SOME PILOT. PROJECTS FOR A MOBILE. RECYCLING CENTERS TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE NOW VERY UNDERSERVED ON THAT. I THINK STILL THE INITIAL STAGES BUT GETTING UNDERWAY AND THEN SUDDENLY. CAO RECYCLE DID I IN ACTS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS. SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE ROLE CLOSURES BUT I'M SURE OF THAT TRACTORS ELABORATE ON THAT MORE THAN I CAN. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. RETAIN. SO GOING BACK BACK IN MY OPENING COMMENTS WHAT DO YOU WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THE PROGRAM TO BE COMEY ZERO WAYS PROGRAM AT THAT THAT. THE PEAK OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT WHAT WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO. BUT. THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH I THINK IF YOU IT CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM HOUSE ONE OF THE RELATIVELY HIGHER RECYCLING RATES OF SOME OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN. YOU KNOW PLACES I HAVE INCREASED THEIR DEPOSIT A AMOUNT THAT'S TIED THE CONTAINERS THEY'VE USUALLY SEEN SOME KIND OF AN INCREASE IN RECYCLING JUST BECAUSE OF THE STRONGER INCENTIVES. THAT'S PROBABLY THE MAIN ONE THAT COMES TO MIND BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WOULD KIND OF AND YOU CLOSER TO THAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. ALUMINUM AND STATE HAS BEEN AT A HUNDRED PERCENT OR CLOSE TO IT BEFORE AND SO I FULLY TIED TO. BUT THE SCOUT VALUES AND SO PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE HIGHER VALUE WHEN THEY BRING IT BACK. BUT. YOUNG JUST INCREASING CONSUMER RECYCLING WOULD PROBABLY IT AS WELL AND INCREASED THE RATE OVERALL. SO GLASS A HIGHER VOLUME OF WRIST AND ALUMINUM WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THEIR. RATES ARE SO LOW. FOR THE GLASS RECYCLING. I THINK IT'S FOR A FEW REASONS UP FIRST ALL IT'S HEAVIER. AND SO PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY I THINK TO TO BRING IT INTO THEIR STORAGE LARGER TO CARRY ITS ONLY YOU CAN AND THAT. YOU CAN KIND OF CRUNCH AND THEN I THINK SECONDLY IN IN. DRUGS OR SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO PROBABLY. I'D GET INTO THE NITTY DETAILS ON THIS LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT IT IT WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH IT BEING BROKE AND IN SOME OF THE SINGLE. SINGLE STREAM CURBSIDE AND SO THAT CAN CAUSE. THE GLASS NOT EVER MAKE IT RECYCLING CENTER OR TO HAVE TO BE DISPOSED OF. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WERE GOING TO TAKE ROLE NOW AND THEN PROBABLY RECESSED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES. OF MISTER SMITH LINE IS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING MR DEROSE IS ON HIS WAY OVER IT'S PROBABLY. TWO OR THREE MINUTES AWAY NOW. WE'LL TAKE. ROLL SLOWLY. SILICON HELPS THAT OUT. BLOOM HERE FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. THE WE HAVE A CORPSMAN THAT WILL RECESS FOR JUST COMPLIMENTS INTO MISTER DIRECTS OUR RIGHTS THANK YOU ARE A. RATHER THAN DELAY ANY FURTHER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE. OTHER ITEMS SO HONORED GENDER SEVERAL PANELS I SHOULD SAY. OF. WE'RE WE'RE JUST GONNA PROCEED WITH A SUSAN COLLINS AND MARK MURRAY AND THEN WILL WILL REVERSE ORDER IF THAT'S ALRIGHT. SO MR MURRAY MS COLLINS MORNING DOCUMENT LEADERS. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CAN YOU HEAR ME TO STEP HE PULLED OUT A LITTLE CLOSER TO RIGHT I THINK IT'LL BE A LITTLE EASIER KISSED THE MARKETS BASED AND THE OTHER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. ASKING ME TO COME AND SPEAK HERE GROUP ABOUT AND CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING IN LITTER REDUCTION PROGRAM. AND JUST A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT THE CONTAINER RECYCLING INSTITUTE IS. I AM SUSAN COLLINS I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONTAINER RECYCLING INSTITUTE. AND WE ARE A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE THAT DOES RESEARCH EDUCATION AROUND PACKAGING RECYCLING. OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE NORTH AMERICA GLOBAL MODEL FOR THE COLLECTION AND QUALITY RECYCLING OF PACKAGING MATERIALS. AND AS WE DO OUR RESEARCH AND BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AROUND THE WORLD THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BEST PRACTICES WERE LOOKING FOR. HOW DO YOU GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY RECYCLING THE HIGHEST QUANTITY OF RECYCLING AT THE LOWEST COST AND AGAIN JUST FOCUS ON ON PACKAGING MATERIALS BUT IF YOU CAN IT IT WAS JUST STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THOSE THREE THAT SORT OF RECYCLING NIRVANA HIGH QUALITY HIGH QUALITY LOW COST? SO A LITTLE BIT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE ON BEVERAGE CONTAINER DEPOSIT LAWS. IT'S INCREDIBLE THE GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AROUND THE WORLD TO SINCERE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THERE'VE BEEN FIFTEEN NEW DEPOSIT LAS SERVING MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SO THIS IS A VERY MUCH A GROWING AND. TOPIC AND THEY'RE PICKING UP IN A BIG WAY IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA. AND WE'RE HEARING NOW THAT THE U. N. IN THE G. SEVEN ARE ALSO LOOKING AT DEVELOPING NATIONS. AND THE ISSUE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP CHAIRMAN BLOOM ABOUT SAM PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THE MARINE DEBRIS ISSUE. IS A HUGE DRIVER OF THESE CONTAINERS POSIT LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES THIS IS JUST. NEW LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WERE DOING RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ON. A MORE THAN TWO DOZEN BILLS IN. ABOUT A DOZEN STATES AT THROUGHOUT THE US SO IT'S IT'S A TOPIC THAT'S RECEIVING A LOT OF ATTENTION NOT JUST HEARING CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE U. S.. ALSO ARE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT PROBLEMS TODAY BUT I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE INCREDIBLE SUCCESS AND IT IS A PROGRAM THAT STILL HAS A SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT RECYCLING RATE WHICH IS AMAZING FOR RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL. AND THE BIGGEST PROGRAM FOR CONTAINER DEPOSITS IS IN GERMANY CALIFORNIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD. AM AND DAD THAT WILL HOLD UNLESS THE U. K. A TOPS AND THE DEPOSIT LA THEN NOPE THE PUMP IS DOWN TO NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE FROM NUMBER TWO. THE OTHER THING THAT HAS RECEIVED A LOT OF CONVERSATION IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE DISCUSSION OF STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. AND WE SHOULD REALLY A NOT BE DISCUSSING THAT A LOT TODAY. AND THE PROGRAM ACHIEVED A SURPLUS IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. OF FORTY FOUR MILLION IT'S GOING TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM FROM THAT IN. CAO RECYCLES QUARTERLY REPORT BUT THERE WAS A THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS PLUS ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN INTERNAL TRANSFERS SO DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE MAIN FUND BUT IT WAS JUST MOVING MONEY FROM ONE ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER. ALTOGETHER BETWEEN THE FUND BALANCE IN THE MAIN FUND AND THE FUND BALANCES AND THE OTHER FOR FUNDS THERE'S MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUND BALANCE. SO. THAT'S NOT IT YOU KNOW YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT A PLACE WHERE YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO. THE THING THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS AN IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY THAT'S A DISTRACTION WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE WANNA DO. AND HERE'S THE BIG BIG TOPIC THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES. THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. SINCE THE PEAK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. NEARLY ONE THOUSAND REDEMPTION CENTERS HAVE CLOSED. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR A WHOLE BUNCH IT FOR REASONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON IN THIS CHART IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT THE STEEPEST PART OF THE. DECLINE OCCURRED BETWEEN MID TWENTY FIFTEEN AND MID TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I HAVE SEVERAL MORE CHARTS THAT ARE GONNA EXPLAIN WHY THIS HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED. AND UNDERSTANDING WHY IT HAPPENED AND WHAT HAPPENED ARE ABSOLUTELY INSTRUMENTAL. FOR US TO KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. SO. BRIEFLY READING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IN EACH OF THESE COLUMNS THE COST OF RECYCLING IS THE COST THAT THE REDEMPTION CENTERS BEAR THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES OF REVENUE. THE PROCESSING PAYMENT THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE SCRAP VALUE THEY RECEIVE AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THEM WHOLE. YOU CAN SEE IN THE MAY TWENTY SIXTEEN COLUMN THIS IS FOR P. ET THEY HAD A COST OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS A TON. AND THE TO PAYMENTS THAT THEY WERE GETTING. WASN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM WHOLE THEY WERE THEY WERE RECEIVING A SHORT FALL. FORTY FIVE DOLLARS ON EVERYTIME OF P. ET THAT THEY HANDLE. DID THE EXACT NUMBERS ARE AN IMPORTANT HERE IT'S JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS IS HOW THEY GET PAID AND THIS IS HOW GET THE. THEY WERE GETTING PAID AND IT WASN'T WORKING IT WAS LOSING THE MONEY AND EVERY TIME THE HANDLE. ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCRAP VALUES TRENDING DOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIS IS A COMPLETELY EXTERNAL SOURCES IS SOMETHING THAT NOBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ANY CONTROL OVER. BUT IT IS SOMETHING WHAT WE CAN CONTROL IS HOW WE REACT TO IT. SO THE SCRAP VALUES WERE DECLINING FOR P. ET FOR ALUMINUM CANS AND FOR GLASS AND HERE'S THE KEY. IT ALL HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME. IF ONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. THE REDEMPTION CENTERS MIGHT OF WEATHER DOT PROBLEM. YOU CAN SEE IN THE DATE THAT THE REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSED IT CORRELATES VERY STRONGLY TO WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE RIGHT ALUMINUM CANS. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ONE PART OF THAT CHART WHERE THE LINE DECLINES DRAMATICALLY THEIR STE IT JUST FALLS OFF OF A CLIFF. THAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE P. T. PRICES WERE FALLING OFF A CLIFF. NOW HERE IN THIS NEXT CHART THERE'S TWO LINES HERE. THE ACTUAL SCRAP VALUE IS WHAT THE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE PAYING. THAT'S THE DOTTED LINE. THE. BULLS LINE THE FILLED IN LINE ON THE TOP OF EACH OF THESE GRAPHS. IS WHAT CAL RECYCLES FORMULA THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE PAID TO THE GAP IN BETWEEN THOSE LINES IS WHERE THE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE EXPERIENCING A SHORTFALL. AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE BIGGEST GAPS OCCURRING FOR P. ET AND GLASS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN TIME PERIOD AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHEN THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. WERE ALSO RECEIVING LESS MONEY FROM ALUMINUM BECAUSE THE ALUMINUM PRICES IT FALLING OFF A CLIFF. SO OF THESE THOUSAND CENTERS THAT HAVE CLOSED OVER THIS FIVE YEAR PERIOD. ALMOST HALF OF THEM FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX OF THEM CLOSED IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. AND IT WAS THAT THAT TERRIBLE PERIOD WHERE ALL THE PRICES DECLINED. SO. WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT THIS PROGRAM DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT IT NEEDED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OCCURRED VERY QUICKLY AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO SOLVE IT? BUT THE PROBLEM ALSO OCCURRED BEFORE THAT TIME PERIOD AND AFTER THAT TIME PERIOD AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY TOOLS TO ADDRESS THAT EITHER EXCEPT FOR THE RECENT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT CAME ABOUT. CHAIRMAN BLOOM YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU HAD A QUESTION SHOULD I STOP HERE. HER I WAS SET PONDERING WHETHER TO ASK YOU WHAT THOSE TOOLS ARE THAT WE NEED. BUT I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO THAT I'M AVERAGE I. THANK YOU. IT SO IT DID THIS IS SORT OF A RESTATEMENT OF THE SAME THING IT SHOWS HOW MUCH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE UNDERPAID. EACH YEAR FOR YOU KNOW THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND THEN HERE IT IS CUMULATIVELY. SO IF A REDEMPTION CENTER WAS EXISTING AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS TIME AND THEY WERE ABLE TO STICK IT OUT THROUGH LOSING A LOT OF MONEY. IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S ONE THING BUT THEN THE CUMULATIVE LOSSES MOUNTED. AND OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME THOSE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE UNDERPAID BY A TOTAL OF SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. SO ALL OF THAT MAKES IT COMPLETELY OBVIOUS WHY WE LOST A THOUSAND REDEMPTION CENTERS. THERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL CLOSING OF REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE. I THEY BASICALLY BEEN EVICTED BY THEIR LANDLORDS OR THE SUPERMARKETS THAT ARE HOSTING THEM. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE THOUSAND WERE CLOSED IN THAT WAY. BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S PART OF IT. AS WELL. SO AN ENCOUNTER CYCLE. INCLUDED A STATEMENT IN THEIR QUARTERLY REPORT THIS LAST TIME WHERE THEY SAID WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE THEY NEED HELP FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THROUGH OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. SO. WHEN WHAT THE KEY THING ABOUT ANY DEPOSIT PROGRAM IS THAT. THERE EXISTS A SOCIAL CONTRACT. TWEEN THE STATE AND THE CONSUMERS. THE STATE PUTS THE LINE PLACE THAT SAYS IF YOU RETURN THIS BEVERAGE CONTAINER WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET YOUR FIVE CENTS BACK. AND. THE CONSUMERS ARE OWED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR FIVE CENTS BACK. SO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE REDEMPTION CENTERS IN ENTIRE COUNTIES. AND INDEED THEIR SEVENTEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE EITHER ZERO OR ONE OR TWO OR THREE REDEMPTION CENTERS. THAT HAS BROKEN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. FOR TELLING THE CONSUMERS TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT ALLOWING THEM WHAT THEY NEED THE ACCESS TO RECYCLING TO DO IT. THE OTHER PART OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS. AND WE WILL RECYCLE THIS PRODUCT. THE AT THE EXPECTATION. IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT. SO RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY HAVE WE LOST THESE THOUSAND AND REDEMPTION CENTERS BUT THE POPULATION IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING MORE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAN THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO SO THIS MEANS WE ARE RETURNING MORE CONTAINERS. PER PERSON AND WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE RETURNING CONTAINERS THAN EVER BEFORE. AND NOW WE HAVE FEWER CENTERS. SO THIS CHART IS LOOKING AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THIS SAYS WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SERVED BY EACH REDEMPTION CENTER. AND WE REACHED A POINT WHERE IT WAS AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. SERVED BY EACH REDEMPTION CENTER NOW IT'S MORE LIKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVED BY EACH REDEMPTION CENTER. SO THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. ARE MORE CROWDED THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC THAT'S A BIGGER IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY ARE. AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE LONGER. UP WITH THE INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN THE COST OF THE CENTERS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALREADY THE CENTERS ARE ALREADY FINANCIALLY BELEAGUERED. THEY HAVE CUT THE HOURS THEIR CENTERS ARE OPEN AGAIN SQUEEZING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AND MORE AND MORE CONTAINERS. INTO A SPACE THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED PHYSICALLY A SPACE THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO ACCEPT THAT MANY CONTAINERS. AND WHAT ARE THEY DESIGNED TO. TO. THEY WERE DESIGNED SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO HANDLE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN THOUSAND AT PEOPLE PER CENTER NOT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO EACH CENTER IS RECEIVING ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT MORE CONTAINERS THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. I AM SO YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON THEIR PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT. SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED THE ANALOGY. ANALOGY I WILL MAKE IS THAT. IF YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE PUT OUT THE FIRE AND THEN TALK LATER ABOUT REDECORATING. SO WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING ANY CONVERSATIONS TODAY ABOUT REDECORATING ALL OF OUR CONVERSATION SHOULD BE FOCUSED TOWARD THIS MAIN MAIN ISSUE WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND CALIFORNIA SO THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO RETURN THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. SO TO HEAR STICKING A DEEPER DIVE INTO. HOW ONE MATERIAL TYPE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN AFFECTED MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO MAJOR MATERIAL TYPES THIS THIS DATA IS FOR GLASS? WHAT WE'RE SEEING? IS THE WE HAVE THE GENERAL STATISTIC THAT THE CURRENT RECYCLING RATE IS SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT AND WE KNOW THAT DIETS FIVE TO SEVEN POINTS LOWER. THEN IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO. HOWEVER. THAT'S THE OVERALL RECYCLING RATE IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE SHIPS. OF THE MATERIALS FROM. AT THE REDEMPTION CENTERS TO CURB SIDE AND FOR GLASS IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC AT THE GREEN BAR THERE SHOWS THAT AND CLASS IS GONE DOWN BY MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT THAT. FROM FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND TIMES DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND TONS GOING THROUGH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. THAT'S THE SUPER CLEAN HIGH QUALITY GLASS. INSTEAD A BUNCH OF THAT GLASS HAS GONE TO THE LANDFILL OF COURSE. A AND THAT'S YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE BLACK LINE ON THE TOP. BUT THE BLUE LINE SHOWS THAT A BUNCH THAT GLASS WAS ALSO ABSORBED BY. SINGLE STREET CURBSIDE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS THE GLASS THAT IS MORE CONTAMINATED AND IS WORTH LESS IN DOLLAR VALUES. SO WHEN YOU SHIFT THE GLASS OUT OF THE HIGH DOLLAR VALUE CATEGORY INTO THE LOWER DOLLAR VALUE CATEGORY. THAT AVERAGE PRICE FOR GLASS GOES DOWN AND THE PROCESSING PAYMENT PASSED TO GO UP TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. SO HERE ALL OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO GLASS. THE CONSUMERS ARE GETTING LAST REFUNDS AN ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL MATERIALS IT'S IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING THAT'S LESS THAN WHAT THEY USED TO AT. AND IT MADE EVEN BE BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THAT OF AYE RECALCULATE. THE REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE GETTING LESS MATERIAL. THE MERCK'S ARE GETTING MORE GLASS AND THEY DON'T WANT MORE GLASS. THE QUALITY IS LOWER. SO THE PROCESSORS AND THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO EITHER HAVE HIGHER COSTS. OR THEY GET LESS MATERIAL WHICH THEY WANT TO MAKE RECYCLED CONTENT PRODUCTS. ALL THE WHILE THE FUND IS ACTUALLY PAYING MORE. TO GET LAST CLASS AND LOWER COSTS QUALITY GLASS AND THE MANUFACTURERS ARE PAYING MORE TO. SO NO ONE WINS HERE. NO ONE WENT SO THOUGH ON GLASS THOSE OF THE OUTCOMES WHETHER WHAT OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THOSE OUTCOMES YOU KNOW ACTUALLY MADE A GOOD POINT WHEN SHE SAID WITH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSING IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA TRAVEL FARTHER ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE. I IF THERE IF ON A BIKE IF THERE ON FOOT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CARRY THE HAVE YOUR CLASS THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE ALUMINUM IN THE P. ET AND FOR RECYCLING. SO I'M ALL OF THE RATES ARE DOWN INCLUDING GLASS BUT I THINK GLASS SUFFERS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE OTHER MATERIAL TYPES IN THAT SCENARIO. SO AGAIN I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION THE ANSWER IS MORE REDEMPTION CENTERS IN MORE PLACES. AND I DO HAVE A SLIDE HERE AND HOW IT'S AFFECTED DIFFERENT PLACES. IN ADDITION TO THE RURAL COUNTIES SUFFERING A LOT AND LOSING REDEMPTION CENTERS TO THE POINT WHERE SOME OF THEM HAVE NO REDEMPTION CENTERS AT ALL. THE PLACES THAT HAVE HIGH RENT. HAVE ALSO LOST REDEMPTION CENTERS YOU CAN IMAGINE OF COURSE THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGHER COSTS. SO I THINK. EIGHT OUT OF THE TEN HARDEST HIT COUNTIES THE ONES THAT HAVE MOST SCARCE REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND THAT WAS RESULT I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND WHEN WE CRUNCH THESE NUMBERS. AND THE PERCENTAGE LOST. I THINK AM SEVENTEEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HAVE LOST MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. SO. THE LOSSES. ARE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. BUT IN SOME COUNTIES THE REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE SO SCARCE AND THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME FINDING A CONVENIENT LOCATION RETURN THERE THE CONTAINERS. SO AGAIN I HAVE RELEGATED SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES TO THIS SLIDE COMING VERY LATE IN MY PRESENTATION AND IT'S BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS THE RESTORATION. I THE REDEMPTION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONSUMER CONVENIENCE I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE AND LOOK AT MODERNIZATION OPPORTUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS OF COLLECTING CONTAINERS THAT WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN IN OTHER STATES THEY'RE FIFTY PROGRAMS. AROUND THE WORLD THAT DO BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING SO THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF RETURNING CONTAINERS. THAT WE CAN LOOK AT AND LEARN FROM THOSE AND CHOOSE MORE MODERN AND BETTER APPROACHES THAT WE HAVE NOW. AS WE ALSO JUST REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN A VERY CONVENTIONAL WAY. THERE'S ALSO STILL THIS ISSUE OF REVENUE COLLECTION WE WROTE A REPORT ABOUT THIS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. WE BELIEVE THAT MORE AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. I'M STILL NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED FROM THE FREE RIDERS IN THE SYSTEM. AND ACT CAL RECYCLE HIS HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THEY ARE AT TAKING ON NEW MEASURES TO FIND THE MANUFACTURERS AND AND DISTRIBUTORS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SYSTEM. AND TEN CAN YOU BE A LOT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THAT TERM FREE RIDERS MEANS WHOSE INCLUDED IN THAT GROUP. SURE AND FREE RIDERS WOULD BE EITHER. THAT MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO EITHER UNDER REPORT THEIR SALES OF BEVERAGES AND IN ORDER TO NOT PAY AS MUCH MONEY INTO THE FUND OR. THOSE THAT DON'T REGISTERED ALL AND DON'T PAY ANYTHING AT ALL. AND SOME OF THAT CAN HAPPEN JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE YOU KNOW PAYING THEIR NICKELS AND THE FUNDING BE REGISTERED WITH CALPERS CYCLES. THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH NEW BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAL RECYCLE. AT COMMENTED ON IN ONE OF THEIR REPORTS IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE NEW CRAFT BREWERS IN THE STATE. SO A LOT OF THE SMALL COMPANIES WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SYSTEM IT TAKES SOME OUTREACH. DOES THAT INCLUDE. A WINE BOTTLES. NO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM. YEAH. SO. CAL RECYCLE DID TAKE SOME STEPS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO AUDIT MORE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN CAL RECYCLE WAS DOING SIXTY AUDITS PER YEAR THEN IT DROPPED DOWN TO AROUND THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE PER YEAR. OUT WITH THE ADDITION OF THESE NEW PEOPLE THEY WERE BACK UP TO SIXTY THIS LAST YEAR. AND THAT PAID OFF IN SPADES AND THERE WERE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND AUDIT FINDINGS. IT IS THE ARE THE AUDITING PROGRAM IS ONE THAT PAYS FOR ITSELF EVERY YEAR. AT A MINIMUM EVEN THOUGH THE LOW YEARS CAL RECYCLE GETS THREE DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND IN AUDITING. IT WOULD ALSO SERVICE AS MORE OF A DETERRENT AS IF PENALTIES WERE ACTUALLY ASSESS I MEAN THERE IS ONE COMPANY THAT PAGE FOURTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. LAST YEAR. AND AUDIT FINDINGS BUT THEY WEREN'T ASSESSED ANY PENALTIES. IN TERMS OF IMPROVING FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FORECASTING I WILL SAY THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT HAS GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AND DIETS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID. A GIVE CAL RECYCLE A CLEAN AUDIT ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS AND THEIR AUDITS THEY DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAD AUDITED% CAO RECYCLING FOUND THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE MATERIALLY MISSTATED. SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED NOW A CLEAN AUDIT AND I'M GLAD AND THAT THAT'S IMPROVING. AND THEN REDUCING PAYMENTS FOR CONTAMINATION THAT SEEMS LIKE LOW HANGING FRUIT. CAL RECYCLE DID AN ASSESSMENT AND FOUND THAT TIME OF THE PAYMENTS THAT THEY MAKE TO THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION THERE LITERALLY PAYING TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR TRASH. IN THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE BALES ARE DIRTY AND CONTAIN MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT PEACHY WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE P. ET AND HDPE WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AGE TO BE. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S. ONE OF THE EASIER PLACES WHERE THEY COULD A STRIVE TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL OUTCOMES THE PROGRAM. THIS SLIDE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CONTAMINATION LOOKS LIKE THIS IS. A REAL FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA ON THE LEFT TO THOSE OR GLASS DEPOSIT BOTTLES ON THE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE TRASH IT'S ACTUALLY GLASS FROM CURBSIDE PROGRAMS. A LOT OF THE PLASTIC AND PAPER HAS FLOATED TO THE TOP IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CLASS IN THERE THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE. BUT IT SORT OF SHOWS YOU THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PROCESSORS HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO CLEAN UP THAT PILE IN AND GET CLEAN GLASS OUT OF IT. ANOTHER THING THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT. THE CAL RECYCLE PROGRAM IS THAT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST CURBSIDE RECYCLING FUNDING PROGRAM IN THE US. MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS PAID TO THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS. AND ON A REVENUE PER CONTAINER BASIS. THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS ARE RECEIVING. AT AS OF THE. THE DATE OF THESE IT WOULD BE LOWER NOW BECAUSE THE SCRAP VALUES A LOWER BUT IT WAS MORE THAN TEN CENTS PER CONTAINER. THERE'S NO OTHER DEPOSIT PROGRAM THAT USES ITS RESOURCES THIS WAY. NOW LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. ACTUALLY ALSO MENTIONED WHEN SHE WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO GET CLOSER TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. OREGON HAS RECENTLY INCREASED THEIR DEPOSIT FROM FIVE CENTS TO TEN CENTS AND NOT HAS LED TO A WONDERFUL RESULT. THEY USE TO HAVE A REDEMPTION RATE JUST A YEAR AGO THAT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. AND WEDNESDAY INCREASE THE DEPOSIT VALUE TO TEN CENTS. NOW THEY'VE GONE OVER EIGHTY PERCENT THEIR EIGHTY TWO PERCENT SO ASSERTIVE OVERNIGHT THEY FLIPPED A SWITCH AND THEY WENT FROM SIXTY FOUR PERCENT TO EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. THEY'VE ALSO EXPANDED THEIR PROGRAM TO INCLUDE MORE CONTAINER TYPES. AND OREGON. ACTUALLY HAS MORE REDEMPTION LOCATIONS THAT CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH THERE POPULATION IS ABOUT THE TENTH OF OURS. BECAUSE ALL OF THE STORES TAKE BACK CONTAINERS. A QUESTION YEAR IN TERMS OF CONTAINER TYPE YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY'VE INCREASED THE A CONTAINER TYPES. OF. THAT'S I ASSUME WITHIN ORGAN THEY SHIFTED THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER TYPES HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM. THEY'VE NOW CAUGHT UP WITH CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE NOT ARE ALREADY. WHERE THEY ARE NOW? IN TERMS A CONTAINER TYPES YES YES. THEY THEY DO NOT ACCEPT WINE AND SPIRITS IN THEIR PROGRAM OR MILK JUST LIKE CALIFORNIA. THEY. THEY ACTUALLY BUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT LESSON FROM. OREGON IS THAT THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR EXPANSION AND MODERNIZATION PROCESS IN STAGES SO TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE MEANS SORT OF TOO MUCH CHANGE AT ONE TIME. THEY FIRST EXPANDED TO WATER BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY COVERING CARBONATED BEVERAGES NOW THAT'S SOMETHING CALIFORNIA DID LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO THEY EXPANDED TO WATER. THEN THEY WENT FOR FIVE CENTS TO TEN CENTS AND THEN EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT THEY WENT TO. ALL OF THE OTHER NON CARBONATED BEVERAGES LIKE TEA AND SPORTS DRINKS AND ENERGY DRINKS THE ONES THAT WE ALREADY COVER IN OUR PROGRAM. SO TERMS A CONTAINER TYPES AND BEVERAGE TYPES THEY CAUGHT UP WITH US. BUT IN TERMS OF THIS STYLE OF REDEMPTION THEIR MODERNIZATION IS A GENERATION AHEAD OF US. THEY'VE GOT BOTTLE DROP RETURN CENTERS WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY NICE AND. REDEMPTION CENTERS WITH THREE DIFFERENT STYLES OF RETURN YOU CAN BAG UP YOUR MATERIALS AND THAT IN A BAG WITH YOUR OWN TWIST TIE WITH YOUR OWN BAR CODE AND JUST DROP IT THROUGH THE SLOT. THEY'RE INTRODUCING THESE BOTTLE DROP EXPRESSED SITES AT GROCERY STORES SITTER AGAIN EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF SITES WHERE PEOPLE CAN RETURN COULD CONTAINERS AND THEY'RE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING THE EASE WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN RETURN CONTAINERS. NO WAITING IN LINE AT ALL IF YOU HAVE YOUR MATERIALS BAG WITH YOUR OWN BAR CODE ON YOUR BACK. YOU JUST OPEN THOSE SLOT THAT'S LIKE A MAILBOX AND DROP YOUR YOUR BAG OF MATERIALS IN AND SOMEONE WILL COUNT THEM FOR YOU LATER AND PUT THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT ELECTRONICALLY. AND YOU CAN EVEN DESIGNATE YOUR REFUND TO GO TO A CHARITY IF YOU WANT OTHERWISE YOU CAN AND GET YOUR MONEY OUT LATER AT A KIOSK AT A GROCERY STORE. AND THE GROCERY STORES ARE SO ON BOARD WITH THIS THAT THEY ACTUALLY GIVE A BONUS OF TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT IF YOU REDEEM. IF YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK WITHIN THAT GROCERY STORE. WHAT IS IT THAT IS DRIVING THE GROCERY STORES TO? LIKE THIS PROGRAM SO MUCH AN ORGAN. THEY LOVE THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN THE LARGE VOLUME RETURNS OUT OF THE GROCERY STORES AND INTO THESE BOTTLE DROP REDEMPTION CENTERS. AND THEY LOVE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE FOOT TRAFFIC AND THE DOLLARS INTO THE STORE WHEN THEY GET PEOPLE DROPPING OFF THEIR BAGS IN THE STORE. OR AT REDEEMING THEIR LITTLE THEIR TICKET SIR YOU KNOW USING THE KIOSK TO GET THERE. REDEMPTION VALUE AND THEN SPENDING THAT IN THE STORE. SO IT'S THE IT'S THE FOOT TRAFFIC. AND IT'S THE DOLLARS BROUGHT INTO THE STORES. THANK YOU YES. WITH THIS PERHAPS. WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MIRROR OREGON'S? PROCESS PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION MADE IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE OREGON HAS. BUT A PRETTY GOOD JOB IT IS IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM OURS THAT WE NEED TO RETOOL LARS. BOTH WITH RESPECT TO POLICY AND. ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. HOW FAR ARE YOU APART AND CAN WE GET CLOSER TO WHAT THEY DO SURE WELL IT CAN BE DONE SO OR IT'S NOT JUST ORGAN THAT HAS THIS TYPE OF A DROP SYSTEM? AND THEY ALSO M. IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS FIRST IN MAINE ABOUT FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS AGO AND THEN THE COMPANY CALLED CLINK THAT OPERATES THE PROGRAM IN MAINE ALSO EXPANDED THEIR OPERATIONS INTO NEW YORK. AND AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS THAT WORK ON THE PROGRAM IN OREGON. IN ALL OF THOSE CASES THEY DID HAVE TO MAKE TWEAKS TO THEIR LAWS TO ALLOW THESE NEW SYSTEMS TO OPERATE. TIME BUT IT WASN'T IN NO INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS TO GET THROUGH THAT. AND. IN ALL OF THOSE CASES THERE'S A STABLE RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH MONEY FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO OPERATE. THAT'S A KEY THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE HERE THOSE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE THOSE PROGRAMS DON'T WANT TO OPERATE. IN THE INCREDIBLY VOLATILE FUNDING AT CLIMATE THAT WE HAVE HERE. A CAN YOU IDENTIFY THOSE STREAMS GENERAL FUND SPECIAL TAX BUT WHAT'S BUT IT WHAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF THE STRAIN THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR STREAM IS THAT. THAT TO PAYMENTS THAT I DESCRIBE THAT REDEMPTION CENTERS GATT. ARE BOTH VOLATILE. IT IN ALL OF THE OTHER PLACES IT'S A IT'S A DOLLAR AMOUNT PER CONTAINER SO WHEN YOU WHAT AS I WOULD IF THEY HAD IS OREGON DO. THAT THAT IS DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO PAY. SURE EARLIER WITHOUT REDUCING THE VOLATILITY IN GETTING THAT JUST WHAT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM. TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS OUR DESCRIBE OTH NEW YORK AND OREGON AND I AND I JUST WANNA BE COMPLETE AND MY ANSWER TO YOU BECAUSE THEY BOTH WORK BUT THE REALLY DIFFERENT. SO IN NEW YORK AND MAINE THE HANDLING FEE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CENTS PER CONTAINER. SO THAT THE PRIVATE COMPANY CAN COME IN AND THEY KNOW IN ADVANCE I'M GONNA GET THREE AND A HALF CENTS PER CONTAINER ON EVERY CONTAINER I HANDLE. THE FUNDING SOURCE IS COMING FROM THE BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS DIRECTLY THAT'S THAT THE NEW YORK AND. A MAIN PROGRAMS ARE. INDEPENDENT. INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM SO EVERY DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE HANDLING FEES TO THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OREGON WHICH ORGAN MUCH MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA HAS A CENTRALIZED FUND. AND THE CENTRALIZED FUND RUNS THESE REDEMPTION CENTERS DIRECTLY IT IS A COOPERATIVE CALLED THE OREGON BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING COOPERATIVE. AND OB R. C. AND THEY STAFF THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THEY CITE THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THEY OWN THEM THEY. THEY SEND THE TRUCKS AROUND TO PICK UP ALL OF THE MATERIAL SO REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT ASPECT OF IT IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT. IT IS POSSIBLE TO LAYER SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON TOP OF THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AS LONG AS WE HAVE STABILITY IN FUNDING AND SUFFICIENT FUNDING CHURCH TO RUN AN OPERATION LIKE THAT. START WRAPPING UP HERE. MY LAST COUPLE OF SLIDES. I TOO WANTED TO BRING UP THIS MARINE DEBRIS ISSUE. THERE WHO MOST RECENT RESEARCH IS NOW TELLING US THAT WE HAVE. EIGHT TIMES OF PLASTIC AND HEARING THE OCEAN EVERY SECOND. AND THIS WHALE WAS CONSTRUCTED BY AN ARTIST TO ILLUSTRATE THAT SO IT THAT'S EIGHT TONS OF PLASTIC THE AMOUNT THAT GOES INTO THE OCEAN EVERY SECOND. AND THE OCEANS PROVIDE HALF OF THE OXYGEN WE BREATHE SO. THIS REALLY HEAR HIS. THAT THE HEALTH OF THE OCEANS REALLY IS A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. LASTLY AND THIS IS AN ART PROJECT WE DID LAST SUMMER ON THE BEACH BECAUSE WE WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE ISSUE OF MARINE DEBRIS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROGRAM. TO REDUCING LETTER. IT'S CRITICAL IN REDUCING LETTER AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING BEVERAGE CONTAINER LATER. THIS. ART PROJECT IS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TWO CONTAINERS THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE US CONSUMES EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S IN JUST THE RIGHT MIX OF ALL THE DIFFERENT BEVERAGES LIKE SODA AND WATER AND BEER AND WINE AND IT'S IN JUST THE RIGHT MIX OF GLASS BOTTLES VERSUS PLASTIC PURSES ALUMINUM CANS WE'VE EVEN GOT SOME POUCHES THEREIN SOME GABLE TOP CONTAINERS. I AM BUT IT'S MEANT TO PROVIDE. UP A LITTLE BIT OF CHEER AND HOPEFULNESS AND IN OTHER WAYS SORT OF GLOOMY PRESENTATION. THIS PROGRAM CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO FIX THERE ARE FIFTY OTHER EXAMPLES AROUND THE WORLD OF BEST PRACTICES THAT WE CAN DRAW UPON AND I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPTIMISM. AND. LET'S MOVE ON TO MR MURRAY'S PRESENTE. MORNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. I HAVE OF THIS IS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM ALMOST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THREE DECADES OF. RECYCLING. AND. I WANT TO START OFF BY BUT REALLY THINKING. THE CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE FATHER CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE STAFF UP FOR THE INVESTMENT OF TIME AND THOUGHTFULNESS NOT JUST TODAY BUT REALLY OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. IN TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. ON I ACTUALLY I WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PUTTING OUT THE FIRE BUT ALSO ONE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE REDECORATING THAT I THINK HAS TO. TAKE PLACE. BOB I THINK THAT THE PUTTING OUT THE FIRE SOLUTION THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PUT FORWARD FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. REMAINS EXACTLY THE RIGHT SOLUTION. THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. AS AS TWO HUNDRED DESCRIBED WE FACED REALLY A PERFECT STORM SOME OF THAT WAS A RESULT OF. GLOBAL DECLINE IN SCRAP PRICES. BUT THIS PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABLE TO TO RESPOND DROPS IN SCRAP PRICES BY HAVING. BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES COVER THAT NET COST RECYCLING. ON AND UNFORTUNATELY THE THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING STATUTORY PROVISIONS. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS WE NEED AND SO THE GAP THAT. TALKING ABOUT OF THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. SCRAP PRICE THAT THE PROGRAM SOON FOLKS WERE GETTING WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE SCRAP PRICE THAT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING. AND THUS THE INFRASTRUCTURE LOST YOU KNOW WHAT IS ENDED UP BEING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. SCRAP INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS WAS REALIZING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SCRAP VALUE FOR RECYCLING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THAT. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS LOST ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM. AND WHILE WE DO HAVE THIS PROCESSING PAYMENT THIS THIS PROMISED TO THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE TO COVER THE NET COST RECYCLING IT IS BEEN SLOW TO COVER THAT FULL COST OF RECYCLING. SO. SLOW TO RESPOND IN IN THE CHANGE IN SCRAP VALUE. SECONDLY AGAIN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX STATUTORY PROVISIONS. DECIDED THAT TO IN ORDER TO COVER THE. AVERAGE COST OF RECYCLING. THAT CALLOUSLY BILL WOULD GO OUT AND SURVEY ON IN THE BIG THEY HAD GIVE THEMSELVES TWO YEARS BASICALLY A TWO YEAR TIMEFRAME. ON PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION TO GO BACK AND SURVEY COSTS. BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY SERVING COSTS WITH THEIR SERVING. EXPENDITURES AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS RECEIVING LESS MONEY IN THE FORM OF SCRAP VALUE. THEIR EXPENDITURES GO DOWN. AND SO WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE SCRAP VALUE THAT THE COSTA RECYCLING SURVEY IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF IN THIS DEATH SPIRAL BECAUSE. THE REVENUE WAS GONE DOWN INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSE TO THAT LOST REVENUE BY REDUCING THEIR EXPENDITURES SO THEN THE NEXT COST SURVEY. PEERS SUGGESTS THAT THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS LESS. AND SO THE PROBLEM THAT BEGAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER REIMBURSING RECYCLERS WITH THE THE COST OF RECYCLING WERE NOT COVERING THAT COST RECYCLING. THAT WE WERE BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. THE THIRD COMPLAINT OF THE PROBLEM BOB. NOT STATUTORY REGULATORY ARM IN ANY STATE PROGRAM WHERE WE ASK THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO UP PROVIDE A SERVICE TO COVER UP PUBLIC COST. WE PROVIDE A REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS. AND THE STATUTE WAS SILENT IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM FOR DOING THAT NOW. MANY STATE PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S FOR HEALTH CARE. OR FOR CONSTRUCTION WE PUT OF FIXED. REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN USUALLY IN THE TEN TO FOURTEEN PERCENT RANGE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THAT. CALPERS CYCLE IN AGAIN THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH THEM ARM CAME UP WITH THE A REGULATORY FORMULA THAT SAID LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE RECYCLING SECTOR NATIONALLY. IS REPORTING ON THEIR TAXES. DETERMINE WHAT THEIR PROFIT WAS AND WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT THE REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS. BOB AND IT ENDS UP THAT LIKE EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN THE ECONOMY THE. RECYCLING SECTOR TENDS TO REALLY. SHOW A LOT OF EXPENSES AND KIND OF LOW BALL THEIR PROFIT MARGINS WHEN THEY'RE SUBMITTING THEIR TAXES AND A RESULT AS A RESULT THAT REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN WHEN YOU RELY ON THAT. THAT TAX DATA SHOWS AN EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL IN THE IN THE TWO TO THREE. PERCENT RANGE AND AS WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AN ACTUAL NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF THE RECENT IN IN TERMS OF THE PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE RECYCLING SECTOR NOW HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT. THAT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE RECYCLING CENTER STE SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES LOST MONEY. AND THAT WAS THEN. BY REGULATION THAT HAD TO BE REFLECTED IN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS FOR THE COST RECYCLING SO. IN A NUTSHELL THREE PROBLEMS TO STATUTORY AND ONE REGULATORY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE STATUTORY PROBLEM FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS NOW. AND AGAIN THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB OF OFFERING A SOLUTION TO THAT. THE REGULATORY PROCESS WE HAVE INSULTED. ON THE REGULATORY PROBLEM. WAS IDENTIFIED BY CAL RECYCLE BY STAKEHOLDERS TWELVE MONTHS AGO. AND IN THAT TWELVE MONTHS CAL RECYCLE HAD THE AUTHORITY AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. SO. IN THE ONE INSTANCE WHEN CAL RECYCLE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THEY SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND FRANKLY IN THEIR CREATIVITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM ON REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN BY PUTTING A FIXED NUMBER IN THEIR REPLACING THE OLD OUTDATED REGULATION. THEY ALSO TOOK A STEP IN TERMS OF OUR ADDRESSING ANOTHER COMPONENT A CRISIS WHICH WAS THE LOSS OF OF RURAL RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. BY RECOGNIZING A HIGHER REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN. IN FOR THE UP RULE RECYCLING CENTERS. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS OF OF THE LOS OF OF REVENUE TO THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THE LOSS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF REDUCED RECYCLING CENTERS NOW FOR TWO YEARS. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THE ONE INSTANCE WHERE CAL RECYCLES HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE CAME UP WITH A SUCCESSFUL SOLUTION WHICH IS. YOU KNOW DOES MOTIVATE ME TO THINK THAT. RATHER THAN NECESSARILY TRYING TO CONSTANTLY BE SCRAMBLING TO COME UP WITH LEGISLATION. FIX THE PROBLEM AS THIS CYCLING. INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA EVOLVES OVER THE NEXT THREE DECADES BUT IT MAY BE TIME TO START GIVING MORE AUTHORITY AND MORE DISCRETION TO CAL RECYCLE IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE PUTTING OUT THE FIRE WHAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW TO PUT OUT THE FIRE. SOME. I WOULD REFER TO. THE ACTION ALERT THAT WE PUT OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE SOLUTION LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME SOLUTIONS. WE NEED TO RETURN RECYCLING PAYMENTS THE THE THE COST BASIS FOR THOSE RECYCLING PAYMENTS TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD IT RIGHT THAT WAS PRIOR TO THE LOSS OF ALL THESE RECYCLING CENTERS. NOW THERE NEEDS TO BE A COLA ADJUSTMENT AND WE NEED TO APPLY THAT REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURN PERCENTAGE TO THAT TWENTY FIFTEEN COST. BUT BUT THAT'S THE SOLUTION TO IMPLEMENT THAT COST BASIS. A NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO CREATE SOME FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO BRING RECYCLING CENTERS BACK TO THESE CLOSED UNSERVED A AREAS OF THE STATE. ON IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT WE'VE LOST ALMOST A THOUSAND RECYCLING CENTERS THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. BOB WE DIDN'T LOSE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR. RECYCLING VOLUME. SO I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT WE NEED TO BRING BACK. NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO RECYCLING CENTERS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. THAT PARTICULARLY RURAL COMMUNITIES THE STATE THAT. HAVE NO CONVENIENT RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY. THE THE RECYCLING RATES HAVE GONE DOWN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND AS SUSAN POINTED OUT THE OTHER COST HAS BEEN. THAT NOT P. ET NOT ALUMINUM BUT WITH THE CLOSURE OF THOSE RECYCLING. CENTERS GLASS VOLUME HAS SHIFTED THE CURBSIDE AND HAS BEEN POINTED OUT. CURBSIDE IS NOT THE VERY BEST WAY OF RECYCLING YOUR GLASS CONTAINERS YOU DON'T GET A HUNDRED PERCENT RECOVERY OF THOSE GLASS CONTAINERS. COST BURDEN FOR THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM IT'S A LOS RECYCLING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S A HIGHER COST OF PROCESSING THAT MATERIAL FOR THE GLASS MANUFACTURES. SO BRINGING BACK THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT ONLY DOES IT. FILL THAT PROMISE TO THE CONSUMER OF OF BRING BACK UP PROVIDING THEM WITH AN OPPORTUNITY GET THEIR NICKELS BACK BUT IT SUSAN POINT OUT IT REDUCES THE OVERALL COST OF THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT MOVES THE MATERIAL TO THE PLACE. WHERE IT HAD BOMB IT? CAN HAVE ITS HIGHEST RECYCLING RATE AT ITS LOWEST COST. BOB. ALSO WANNA. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT OF AND MAYBE THIS IS SPEAKING TO US ASSEMBLY MEMBER TINGS ISSUE IN TERMS HOW DO WE GET. TO ZERO WASTE WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT AND AND MAYBE THIS FITS INTO THE REDECORATING ASPECT OF THIS. BOB BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE DID A FABULOUS JOB OF COLLECTING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FOR RECYCLING IN THE STATE. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT RECYCLING IS A GREAT COLLECTION RIGHT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC IS NOW THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTAINER IN OUR BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING SYSTEM. WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING IN THIS PROGRAM PLASTIC CONTAINERS WERE TWO PERCENT. OF THE MARKET SHARE NOW THERE IN EXCESS OF FORTY PERCENT MARKET SHARE THE. HAVE SURPASSED ALUMINUM CANS. AND UNLIKE ALUMINUM CANS PLASTIC CONTAINERS THE SCRAP VALUE FOR THE PLASTIC CONTAINER ISN'T SUFFICIENT TO COVER THAT COST RECYCLING. SO. WE NEED THAT THE THE MARKET BASED MECHANISMS IN THIS PROGRAM TO REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURERS TO COVER THE FULL COST RECYCLING. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT ASKING THE MANUFACTURES TO PAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THAT NET COST RECYCLING. WE HAVE SOMEONE REDEEM MONEY THAT PUMP RIGHT NOW WITH LOW RECYCLING RATES HE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THAT NET COST RECYCLING. IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING BACK TO AN EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT RECYCLING RATE AS WE MOVE CLOSER TO. A HUNDRED PERCENT RECYCLING. THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A GREATER SHARE OF THAT KNOCK THAT NET COST RECYCLING. AND. STATUTE LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS PAY ON. THAT THE LIMITS THAT WERE SET IN STATUTE A DECADE AGO MADE SENSE A DECADE AGO WHEN THE RECYCLING RATE WAS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WE HAD UP. PILE OF UNREDEEMED MONEY BUT WE KNOW THAT AS THAT RECYCLING RATE GOES UP THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY MONEY IS GOING TO COME DOWN. AND THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A GREATER SHARE OF THE NET COST RECYCLING. NOW WE MAY NEVER HAVE TO ASK THEM TO PAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF RECOVERING THEIR CONTAINERS RETURNING THEIR CONTAINERS TO THEM. TO THE GLASS INDUSTRY TO THE PT INDUSTRY BUT WE MAY NEED TO ASK THEM TO PAY MORE THAN THE ELEVEN PERCENT. THAT THEY'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW. FINALLY IN YOU KNOW KIND OF ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS IS BOB. THAT. IN THE CASE OF. A GLASS CONTAINER. A GLASS INDUSTRY IS TAKING BACK AND CONSUMING FIFTY PERCENT OF THE GLASS CONTAINERS THAT ARE SOLD SO THE GLASS CONTAINERS THEIR MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA ARE MADE WITH FIFTY PERCENT RECYCLED CONTENT. WHEN THE PLASTIC SIDE THE STORY IS MUCH DIFFERENT. WE'VE SEEN SOME FABULOUS PRESS RELEASES FROM BEVERAGE COMPANIES TALKING ABOUT THEIR DESIRE TO INCREASE THEIR USE OF RECYCLED CONTENT IN CONTAINERS AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN RELY. ON THE VOLUNTARY EFFORTS OF THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. I SAW. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WHEN THE SCRAP PRICE WHEN WHEN CALIFORNIA OTHER JURISDICTIONS MOVED AWAY FROM PETROLEUM FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR ENERGY NEEDS. THAT REDUCED. COST OF PETROLEUM. TRONG LIAM NATURAL GAS THE WRONG GREETINGS TO MAKE YOUR PLASTIC CONTAINERS. THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY THE BOTTLE MAKERS THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. REDUCE THEIR COMMITMENT A BUYING RECYCLED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T PASS UP THE EXTRAORDINARY LOW PRICES FOR THE VIRGIN PLASTIC SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE. THAT THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS ALWAYS BUYING BACK THAT PLASTIC CLOSING THE LOOP INCORPORATED INTO THEIR CONTAINERS WE'VE GOTTA HAVE MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE MINIMUM CONTENT. FOR GLASS CONTAINERS IN THE INDUSTRY IS EXCEEDED THOSE NUMBERS WE NEED TO HAVE MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT MANDATES FOR ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S PEACE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT THAT WOULD DO EXACTLY THAT SO ON THAT'S GOTTA BE PART OF THE SOLUTION UNDER OF THAT FITS INTO THEPUTTING OUT THE FIRE OR IT FITS INTO THE REDECORATING. BUT THAT'S GOTTA BE AN ELEMENT OF THE OF THE SOLUTION. AGAIN PART OF THE REDECORATING CERTAINLY MAY INCLUDE THE FACT THAT. AGAIN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WE'VE LOOKED AT THE COST TO RECYCLING AND WE'VE WE'VE APPLIED THE SAME STATEWIDE AVERAGE COST RECYCLING TO EVERY RECYCLING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE'VE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT. DIFFERENT BUSINESSES DIFFERENT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE DIFFERENT COSTS BASED ON THEIR VOLUME AND BASED ON THEIR THEIR DISTANCE FROM MARKETS. SO WE MADE NEED TO WE HAVE TO AMEND THE STATUTE TO EITHER. SET A DIFFERENTIAL A TIERED. PROCESSING PAYMENT HANDLING FEE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE DIFFERENT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURES BASED ON THEIR ACTUAL COSTS OR WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT DISCRETION TO CAL RECYCLE TO IMPLEMENT IT THEMSELVES. SO. WE DON'T NEED OVER PAY FOR RECYCLING BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO COVER THE COST OF RECYCLING THOSE CONTAINERS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR COVERING THAT COST RECYCLING BUT ALSO FOR USING THE MATERIAL THAT WE COLLECT FOR RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY I THINK AGAIN I THINK THAT OF. THE SITUATION IN THE WORLD RECYCLING IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND IT MAY NO LONGER MAKE SENSE. DICTATE ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW IN STATUTE WE MAY NEED TO LOOK TO INCREASING THE AUTHORITY. THE DISCRETION RESPONSIBILITY FOR CALPERS CYCLE. THANK FOR THANK YOU. AT AS USUAL ON IT DETAIL. AND I APPRECIATE TO YOUR REPORT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT WE HEARD ABOUT HOW THEY'RE TAKING PLACE IN OREGON OTHER PLACES? YOU KNOW SO. IT IT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE IT. ORGAN IS A SMALLER STATE THERE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED I THINK WAS POINT ABOUT SOME TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED. GROCERY STORES PROVIDING REDEMPTION. TECHNICALLY WE HAVE MORE THAN THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED GROCERY STORES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TECHNICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING. CONTAINERS BACK INSIDE THE STORE. NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING IN OREGON VERSES WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING CALIFORNIA BUT THE GROCERY STORES ARE NOT EXCITED ABOUT THAT RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY. AND THEY'RE NOT PROMOTING THAT RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY. SO. THE OREGON LAW HAS ALWAYS BEEN BASED ON BRINGING CONTAINERS BACK INSIDE THE STORE. FARM AND AND IT WOULD BE VERY ALL CHALLENGES AS A GREAT DEAL OF RESISTANCE TO THAT. BY THE A GROCER NEAR IT AND AND SO THERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER IN REACH IN REBOOTING THIS PROGRAM. DO WE WANT TO PUT GREATER RESPONSIBILITY ON THE GROCERY STORES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND. ON. DEALERS THAT DISTRIBUTE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT SELL TO CONSUMERS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS WERE SITE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OR DO WE WANT TO FOCUS. OUR RECYCLING DOLLARS ON CREATING FULL SERVICE RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE PLACES THAT WE NEED IT AGAIN IT'S TELLING THAT WITH THE CLOSURE OF RECYCLING CENTERS. BOB WE DIDN'T LOSE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE RECYCLING VOLUME OF. ITS ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND IT'S MEANINGFUL THAT WE DID LOSE YOU KNOW FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT TO INCREASE THAT RECYCLING RATE. UP TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT NINETY PERCENT RECYCLING SO WE NEED MORE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. MOM BUT THE CONSUMER HAS IN CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER HAS DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO. USE A FULL SERVICE RECYCLING CENTER AS OPPOSED TO TAKING CONTAINERS BACK INSIDE THE STORE. BUT I WONDER IF THAT ISN'T OUT OF NECESSITY AS OPPOSED TO A CONVENIENCE AND IF WE WERE TO. AND MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CONSUMER WOULD WE NOT TESSA AND THIS IS REALLY. I THINK A QUESTION TO PONDER NOT NECESSARILY ANSWER TODAY. BUT. WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET CLOSER TO THAT DOT NET ZERO RECYCLING GO. I THINK THAT MAKING IT MORE CONVENIENT BOMB IS ABSOLUTELY. BUT YOU KNOW PART OF THE SOLUTION I WOULD LOVE TO HAPPEN I'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ARE TAKE MY BAG OF RECYCLABLES INSTEAD OF STANDING IN LINE WHICH I NOW HAVE TO DO ONCE A MONTH WHEN I TAKE MY RECYCLING CENTER TO THE ONE REMAINING. RECYCLING CENTER IN MY COMMUNITY THAT I'VE GOT TO STAND IN LINE AND I'M STANDING IN LINE WITH LOTS OF OTHER SOCCER MOMS AND DADS AND FOLKS THAT ARE. EITHER THE REDEEMING IT FOR CASH OR THE REDEEMING IT FOR A CHURCH OR A CLUB OR A SOCCER TEAM. AND WE'RE ALL STANDING IN LINE TO GET OUR FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS WORTH OF OF REDEMPTION VALUE AND. I'M SURE IT'S COST ME MORE THAN TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS TO BE STANDING IN LINE SO MAKING IT MORE CONVENIENT HAVING A RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ABLE TO THAT'S THAT'S MORE CONVENIENT. NOT NECESSARILY BASED ON ITS PHYSICAL LOCATION BUT IN TERMS OF THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT TRANSACTION AT THE RECYCLING CENTER SO I'M IN AND OUT. I THINK THAT YOU THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT ELEMENT OF CONVENIENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING. ON IT IS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM. THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE FOCUS THIS THIS BUYBACK RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY TO SO FEW LOCATIONS AND IT IS CREATING THE THE THE HANDFUL OF RECYCLING LOCATIONS THAT REMAIN. IN GROCERY STORE PARKING LOTS ARE PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THOSE LOCATIONS SO. HAVING MORE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS WILL RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE AND SOME OF THE ANGST IN NEIGHBORHOODS ABOUT HAVING. LONG LINES OF PEOPLE LOUD NOISES FROM THAT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE. THERE ARE OTHER IMPACTS BESIDES EFFICIENCY THAT WE NEED TO BE EVALUATING. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON. WITH RESPECT TO A. CONVENIENCE. ISN'T THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE. DEALING WITH THEIR RECYCLABLES IS TO SEPARATE AT THE CURB AND SENATE TO THE WAY CENTER. IT IS THAT I I YOU SUGGESTING ANYTHING THAT WOULD UPSET ME JUST TELL YOU WHAT THE DILEMMA IS HERE. AYE WAS MY FRESNO FOR EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH RECYCLING. LEVEL BUT. IT TOOK US A PERIOD OF TIME AND SOME VERY HARD WORK. WE DESERVE WE DESIGNED AND UTILIZED THIS THAT THREE CAN SEPARATION IT IS. UNIFORM ONLY USED. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS THE MOST. AND THAT GOT US. ABOVE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE WERE GETTING THREATEN WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR A DAY FINE. SO WE DID WE DESIGNED A VERY CONVENIENT WAY OF DOING IT ARE YOU SUGGESTING IN ANY WAY ON DOING THAT CONVENE. ABSOLUTELY NOT ADJUSTING THAT WE UNDO. A CURBSIDE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN FACT I WOULD IN IN RESTATING ONE OF THE THE POINTS THAT SUSAN MADE OF THE FACT THAT THIS SYSTEM THIS CALIFORNIA REDEMPTION SYSTEMS. EXPANDS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORTING THAT CURBSIDE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DOESN'T PLAY FAVORITES IN TERMS OF RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IN FACT SUPPORTS THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING INTEREST. THAT'S SAID. WE NOW KNOW THAT THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. CRAPPIE SYSTEM FOR RECYCLING GLASS CONTAINERS. IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM. EXPENSIVE FOR THE THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS THE GLASS MANUFACTURES THE DON'T WANT THAT CLASS THAT'S COMING FROM THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM. PICTURE THAT DATA SUSAN SHOWED OF THE DIVESTITURE I I'VE BEEN TO ALL THOSE LOCATIONS I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES IN ALL OF THIS. BUT. WHAT SO FINISHED FINISH YOUR YOUR COMMENT WHAT WHAT SO I POINT IS THAT WE HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS RIGHT NOW? HAVE A RECYCLING INCENTIVE THAT PULLS THE MAJORITY OF CONTAINERS INTO A A VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT BUYBACK RECYCLING CYST. FOR THOSE CONSUMERS THAT DON'T WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT SYSTEM THE CONTINUE TO HAVE CURBSIDE RECYCLING WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY UNLIKE ANY OTHER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE PROGRAM SO WE HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. I DON'T THINK IT'S A CHOICE WE DON'T HAVE YOU ASKED THAT THE WONDERFUL FOLKS IN FRESNO HOW WOULD THEY WITH. HOW THEY WOULD FEEL IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO INCLUDE GLASS IN THEIR CURB SIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM AND I THINK THE ANSWER'S GONNA BE? YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME OTHER PLACE COULD GO THAT WOULD BE IDEAL. YEAH AGAIN I THINK THE THE BIG THINK BIG PROBABLY WITH THE WITH THE. ART LARGER BOURBON AREAS OF LIKE FRESNO IS WE GET WEEK WE GOT PLANNING ON ONE SIDE WHICH BASICALLY SAYS WE'RE GONNA FIND A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES WE GET THE JOB DONE. WE GET THE RECYCLING WAY WAY DOWN. AND AND AND WE WE WERE OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE THREAT OF THE STATE WHICH WHICH WAS REAL. AND THEN. SO I'M HEARING IS YEAH IT'S CONVENIENT BUT IT'S WHAT TOO MUCH IN DIRTY. YOU KNOW I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE HEARING ME. POCKET I'M HEARING YOU ON THIS I LOVE MY CURB SIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM IT IS A PHENOMENAL PROGRAM FOR RECYCLING THE BULK OF THE RECYCLABLES THAT WE GENERATE OUR HOUSEHOLD WHICH IS MOSTLY MIXED WASTE PAPER. A BUNCH A PLASTIC PACKAGING IT'S. STEEL CANS TIN CANS ON IT IS A GREAT SYSTEM THAT IS IT IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY CONVENIENCE. IT IS NOT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM WHAT IT BEACHWOOD SYSTEM FOR WHAT I FOURTH WHAT A FOURTH SEPARATION WORK. YOU DON'T I I I THINK THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS. ACCORDING SEATTLE HAVE HAD THEY HAD OF A POINT IN TIME WHERE THEY HAD LITERALLY A SEPARATE BIN FOR THE GLASS. SO THERE I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING. AGAIN I THINK THAT FRESNO HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THEIR CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM. BOB I THINK THAT. FRESNO IS AS POINT AT THIS MOMENT IS MAKING A MISTAKE. BY CLOSING BUYBACK RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO I'M AWARE I'M AWARE OF THAT AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE INCREASING THEIR COSTS OF RECYCLING AT THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM. THEIR RATE PAYERS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE TO GET STOCK MIGHT WITH AYE WORKABLE YES BUT. UNDERSTAND COMPLEX IS BUT. THAT THAT THAT THE POLITICAL REALITY IN FRESNO IS YOU GOT A LOT OF THESE. A NUMBER OF THE SITES THAT QUITE FRANKLY ARE GATHERED THEIR TRASH RECYCLERS BUT THEY'RE ALSO TRASH COLLECTORS. THAT IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT SO YOU TALKING ABOUT CONVENIENCE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IT IN A WAY. THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND I WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO. SOLVE THE. CONVENIENCE ISSUE AND SOLVE THE. THE GLASS ISSUE WITH WITH BUT PERHAPS SOME OTHERS OTHER SUGGESTION BRACKET IN MY OWN CITY I I I THINK WE CARE WEEK WE COULD DO SOME GOOD THINGS IF. IN FACT THE PROCESS IS ABBOTT DON'T LIKE IT BEVERAGE FOLKS DON'T LIKE IT. OUT WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST. CITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE. WAYS OF SEPARATING AND CONVENIENT TO. IT IF PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO GO BACK AND GET THEIR FIVE SENSE THE GOING BACK AND GET THEIR FIVE CENTS. THEY ARE SAYING IT IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO PUT IT IN TO THE BIN. EVERYBODY ON MY BLOCK AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS IN FRESNO SEE THIS AS CONVENIENT AND AS RECYCLING IN THE KIND OF PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK FOR. THAT SEPARATION. I'M I'M WILLING TO LOOK AT HOW WE WE TWEAK A SYSTEM WITHOUT THROWING OUT THE CONVENIENCE AND AND THE. DEMONSTRABLY EFFECTIVE UP REDUCTION AND WHAT WE SEND TO THE WAIST. ASSEMBLY. I THINK. I. QUICKLY AGREE RIGHT THE POINT YOU JUST MAKE IT. GOOD AND ON THAT NOTE YES ALL THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. AND THE. I THINK OF THE CONVERSATION REALLY POINTS OUT JUST HOW COMPLEX S. A OF THE SENATE THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. TO AT AND IT SHOWS HOW WHY IT'S BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO A GET TO A RESOLUTION AND ON THAT NOTE WE WILL CALL UP OUR PANEL TO. I IT WE HAVE PHOTO WITH A SET FROM. THE OF THE. DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING IN RECOVERY. HOWARD LEVINSON CAN DO RUSSIA AND ZOE HELLER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MORNING. FIRST OFF. MY SINCERE APOLOGIES UP FOR FOR BEING LATE THERE WAS SOME MISCOMMUNICATION ON THE THE START TIME. OF FOR THIS MORNING IN THIRTEEN YEARS I'VE NEVER BEEN LATE TO A COMMITTEE SO WELL AS A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING NO DISRESPECT INTENDED WE FORGED AHEAD AND. WERE ANXIOUS TO HEAR YOUR REPORT NOW VERY GOOD. WHITNEY'S AND SO WE HELLER WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY PROFESSIONAL WOMEN AND MEN OF COLOR RECYCLE. DIRECTOR SMITH LINE SINCE HIS REGRETS HE'S A VERY MUCH UNDER THE WEATHER WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY SO. WITHOUT AYE AS YOU. CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAKE IT REQUESTED WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. IN THE CONTEXT A BROADER RECYCLING CHALLENGES AND TRENDS NOT JUST THE CONTEXT OF THE PROGRAM BUT BUT SOME OTHER PHENOMENON THAT ARE HAPPENING IN AND THAT THE COMMITTEE. SHOULD BE AWARE. A LOT HAS EVOLVED AND CHANGED SINCE THE LEGISLATURE DISCUSSED PROGRAM LAST YEAR AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES DISCUSSED FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS PROCESS. BUT WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS THE PROGRAM AND DISCUSS SOME POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS NUTRITIONIST MISS HELLO AS A CIVIL DISCUSS SOME NEW EMERGING CHALLENGES. NOT JUST FOR OUR PROGRAM BUT FOR RECYCLING OTHER RECYCLABLE MATERIALS AND COMMODITIES. AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS MORNING FROM. OTHER PRESENTERS. THERE ARE EMERGING CHALLENGES REPLYING CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND EVALUATE WHAT RECYCLING MEANS AND HOW BEST WE CHIEF RECYCLING. RECYCLING GOALS WITH POLICIES THAT GO BEYOND. COLLECTION AND THEN WILL CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING HOW THESE EMERGING CHALLENGES DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM BUT UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR CHANGE. FOCUS WITHIN THAT PROGRAM AS WELL AS OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAM. SO AS THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS ALREADY AND YOU'VE HEARD THERE ARE ECONOMIC REALITIES THAT CAN INFLUENCE OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROGRAM THESE FACTORS INCLUDE BEVERAGE SALES MATERIALS MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE TRACKING THE DROP IN OIL PRICES WHICH WHICH YOU'VE HEARD. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN PRICES FOR VIRGIN PLASTIC FELL DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT RECYCLE PLASTIC SCRAP FROM RECYCLING CENTERS WAS NOT AS COMPETITIVE ON THE MARKET THIS CREATED. BUT SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGE FOR RECYCLERS AND OPERATORS KNOWS NOTED THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS THESE RECYCLING CENTERS BY PAYING SUBSIDIES THE GENERALLY SEEK TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN RECYCLING CENTER PROFITS FROM SALES SCRAP. AND THE COST OF OPERATIONS HOWEVER THE PROGRAM STATUTES ARE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND YOU'VE HEARD THAT SEVERAL TIMES THIS MORNING. IN HOW AND WHEN CAL RECYCLE CAN ADJUST PAYMENTS TO RECYCLERS UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PAYMENT FORMULAS AS MR MURRAY ALLUDED TO PRESCRIBE IN STATUTE REGULATION RESULTED IN REDUCE SUBSIDIES COMPARED TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. JUSTICE RECYCLERS WERE ALSO RECEIVING LESS FOR RECYCLED SCRAP PLASTIC ON THE MARKET. THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES THAT A RECYCLING CENTER BE LOCATED IN EACH CONVENIENCE ON THIS ZONE AS AS YOU'VE NO DOUBT HEARD IS DEFINED AS A ONE HALF MILE FROM A SUPERMARKET. WERE THREE MILES WITHIN A PEARL AREAS. TO MR MURRAY'S OTHER POINT WHILE HIGHER VOLUME RECYCLING CENTERS WERE AT A SCALE THAT COULD WHETHER THE IMPACT OF THE SCRUB MARKET. AND THE DROP IN PROGRAM SUBSIDIES MANY OF THE LOWER VOLUME SITES INCLUDING MANY WERE REAL RECYCLING CENTERS COULD NOT AND IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE. RURAL AREAS AND MANY OF THEM IN THE NORTH OF THE STATE THAT ARE WITHOUT A CONVENE A RECYCLING CENTER SOME AS MANY AS. TEN TWENTY MILES AWAY CLEARLY NOT NOT CONVENIENT AND AND WHAT THE SPIRIT OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX STATUTE HAD INTENDED. THE STATE EXPERIENCED A NET LOSS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY RECYCLING CENTERS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND IN THE EVENT. OF RECYCLING CENTER CLOSURE AS THE COMMITTEE. HAS HAD LIKELY HEARD. ZONE CAN BECOME UNSERVED COMPELLING DEALERS WITHIN THAT ZONE TO EITHER REDEEM THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND STORE OR PAY A HUNDRED DOLLAR PER DAY IN LIEU FEE. THE CLOSURE OF AT CREATED THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE UNSERVED ZONES YIELDING EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE UNSERVED ZONES IN THE STATE AND LAW STATUTE DEFINES CONVENIENCE SOUNDS. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW US TO CONSIDER RESPOND ALWAYS TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCESOR RECONSIDERATION. OF BASED ON NEW INFORMATION TRENDS AND CHANGING HABITS. WE'VE NOTIFIED. AND WE NOTIFIED OVER THREE THOUSAND GROCERS WITH THE NEW WITHIN THE NEWLY AND SERVES ON SECOND REQUIREMENT TO BRIGHTEN STORE TAKE BACK. FOR PAID THE IN LIEU FEE. TO DATE DEPARTMENT TOTAL. FROM PAYMENTS REGRESSORS IS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND CURRENTLY HUNDRED NINE GROCERS ARE OPTING TO PAY THE FEE WHILE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED. I WILL PROVIDE IN STORE CONTAINER TAKE BACK. TO TOUCH ON THE RECYCLING RATE FOR JUST A MOMENT ONE OF OUR CRITICAL METRICS. OTHER RECYCLING RATE HAS DECLINED AS YOU'VE HEARD BUT WE WANNA BE CAREFUL TO EXAMINE THE MANY FACTORS INFLUENCING THIS CHANGE. OUR MOST RECENT BI ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS EIGHTEEN POINT ONE BILLION CONTAINERS RETURNED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN. TWENTY TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTY. THIS IS A TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR ONE FACTOR IS THE CLOSURE OF HUNDREDS OF RECYCLING CENTERS AND I DON'T INTEND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THAT WERE. OF THOSE CLOSURES A WITH THESE AND SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS HERE THAT IT HAS IMPACTED CONSUMERS. BUT THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF RETURNS REFLECTS A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES THAT WE'VE ADOPTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THESE INCLUDE ELIMINATING THE COMMINGLED RATE AT RECYCLING CENTERS THAT IS. PAYING ONLY FOR C. R. V. MATERIAL WHEN CONSUMERS BRING THAT TO A RECYCLING CENTER. WE'VE ESTABLISHED RECORDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE FOR BRINGING EMPTY BEEN BEVERAGE CONTAINERS INTO CALIFORNIA VIA. CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S BORDER STATIONS THIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS IMPORTED MATERIALS REPORTING. AND WE'RE ANALYZING THOSE REPORTS TO NOTE TRENDS AND AND TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. WE'VE INCREASED OUR FIELD OVERSIGHT OF PROCESSING FACILITIES IN THE STATE. WE'VE REDUCED DAILY LOAD LIMITS FOR MATERIALS AND THE NUMBER POUNDS THAT SOMEONE CAN BRING ON A DAILY BASIS TO RECYCLING CENTER. AND WE PROVIDE A PRE CERTIFICATION TRAINING AND EXAMS FOR POTENTIAL OPERATORS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NECESSARY AND ORDER TO BE A SUCCESSFUL RECYCLING CENTER. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RECYCLING RATE IS BEVERAGE SALES. WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE A BEVERAGE CONTAINERS SOLD IN THE STATE WITH TWENTY POINT TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION SOLD IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THIS IS A TWO PERCENT INCREASE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS IN SHORT CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEIR CONSUMPTION OF SINGLE USE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND IN THIS CONTEXT WHAT YOU'VE WE'VE HEARD AS WELL THIS MORNING IT'S NOTABLE. TO TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL TREND IS THE INCREASING CONSUMPTION OF BOTTLED WATER. BOTTLED WATER SALES HAVE BEEN STEADILY INCREASING EACH YEAR AND NATIONAL VOLUME SALES OF SHOWN EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT INCREASE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BOTTLED WATER IS PET. AND IT'S TYPICALLY ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE STRAIN. THE RECYCLING RATE. WAS ESTIMATED AT SEVENTY SEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT FIRST FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN TO A SLIGHT DECLINE. AND WHILE THAT'S BELOW THE STATUTORY GOAL OF EIGHTY PERCENT REMAINS HIGHER THAN MANY OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAMS TODAY. WHILE RETURNS AND SALES PRESENTED CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA MAY SEEM RELATIVELY SMALL THREE PERCENT ROUGHLY THREE PERCENT DECLINE IN RETURN A TWO PERCENT. INCREASE IN REVENUE. IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THOSE AND SORT OF IT AMERICANA EXCEPT APPRECIATED. MISS COLLINS. REMARKS ABOUT THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT IT IS NO LONGER IN A DEFICIT IT'S AND I PAY SURPLUS. TO HELP EXPLAIN IN PART HOW WE GOT THERE AT THREE PERCENT DECLINE IN RETURNS. UNDER ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM IS BASICALLY A THREE OUR THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN EXPENDITURES. TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN SALES IS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SIX MILLION IN REVENUE SUCH ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SWING. UPWARD RELATIVE TO THE FUND. SINCE RELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FUND AND. THERE ARE MORE FUNDS LEFT AND REDEEMED BY IN THE CONTAINER PROGRAM. WELL WE'RE NEAR THE PRUDENT RESERVE. THE STRUGGLE DEFICIT IS GONE AT THIS POINT. AND THE POINT IS TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A FINANCIAL ISSUE BUT IT DOES REFLECT THAT IT THE RECYCLING REYES ON DEBATE KLEIN AND CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WITH THE PROGRAM. WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF OTHER ELEMENTS. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO RETURNS AND THE CHANGE THE INCREASE IN SALES WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. MOST OF THE PROGRAM COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED ARE FOCUSED ON THE COLLECTION SORTING HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE DEVELOPING IN STATE CAPACITY FOR REMANUFACTURING. PM DP PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INEQUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM SUPPORT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PLASTIC MANUFACTURERS. AND THREE GLASSMAN YOU FRACTURES. THE NDP HAS PROVIDED UP TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY EXCUSE ME TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WITH PLASTIC PROCLAIMERS AND MANUFACTURES FOR PROCESSING. AND USING RECYCLED PLASTICS. AND. THOSE PAYMENTS HAVE EXPIRED AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THEY'RE NO LONGER SUPPORTING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S POLICY LEGISLATION ON THAT ON THIS POINT. SO AS WE CONSIDER. ADDRESSING THESE CHANGES AND CHALLENGES TO THE PROGRAM IT'S IMPORTANT ELECT POLICIES AFFECTING RECYCLING MORE BROADLY AS WE TALK ABOUT MARKETS AS WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO AND RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESILIENT SO WITH THAT I'M I'M GOING TO TURN IT TOO SO WE HELLER WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK MORE BROADLY ABOUT RECYCLING AND EXPORTS. THANK YOU. ONE MORNING THANK YOU. FOR TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING AT RECYCLING MORE BROADLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG. COLLECTING SORT INFRASTRUCTURE HERE. WHAT WE'RE LACKING IS? A STRONG REMANUFACTURING INFRASTRUCTURE AND STRONG DIVERSIFIED MARKETS. THIS LEAVES US VULNERABLE TO UNPREDICTABLE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR RECYCLABLE COMMODITIES. MAY GIVE YOU A FEW STATS OF WHAT RECYCLING LOOKS LIKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF ALL MATERIALS GENERATED. RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA. THROWING THEIR BLUE BEEN. ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO THREE QUARTERS ARE EXPORTED TO FOREIGN MARKETS. OF THOSE RECYCLABLES EXPORTED WHICH ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION TONS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. IT'S TO TWO PERCENT OF THOSE WENT TO CHINA. WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT CHINA HAS HISTORICALLY. ON BEEN THE BUYER OF MANY OF OUR RECYCLABLE COMMODITIES. HOWEVER CHINA'S POLICIES FOR RESTRICTING IMPORTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE LED TO DECLINES IN EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES. INDIA'S EXPORTS HAVE BEEN DECLINING SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN. FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN EXPORTS DECREASED BY NINE PERCENT OR TWO MILLION TONS. SO CENTER PRESENTATIONS YOU LAST YEAR CHINA IMPOSED MORE RESTRICTIVE IMPORT POLICIES STRAINING OUR EXISTING RECYCLING SYSTEMS IMMERSING THEM PACKS OF THAT NOW. CHINA ANNOUNCED NATIONAL SOARED POLICY IN JULY OF JUST LAST YEAR. AND WHAT THAT POLICY IN TO DO WAS TO REDUCE IMPORTS OF FOREIGN WASTES THEY'RE LOOKING TOUGH. CLEAN UP THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND NO LONGER BE THE RECIPIENT OF THE WORLD'S GARBAGE ESSENTIALLY. SO NATIONAL SOARED THIS POLICY THAT WAS JUST INTRODUCED IS BUILDING ON A PREVIOUS POLICY THAT WAS CALLED GREEN FENCE. BECAME BORED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THAT POLICY SIMILARLY WAS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE THE IMPORT OF CONTAMINATED MATERIALS TO CHINA. AND WITHOUT THE IMPACTS IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE WAS BACK UPS THE PORTS AND THAT'S REALLY WHEN WE STARTED SEEING A MAJOR DECLINE IN NAM? OUR EXPORTS TO CHINA. GREEN FENCE WAS ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN MEETING CHINA'S GOAL OF. CLEANING UP THE REFINEMENT ENVIRONMENT REDUCING THE IMPORTS OF FOREIGN WASTE. SO AS A RESULT IN PART OF NATIONAL SOARED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN NON IN JULY CHINA NOTIFIED THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION OF TWENTY FOUR WASTE THAT THEY WERE BANNED FROM IMPORT. AND THOSE THAT ARE RELEVANT TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ARE MIXED PAPERS AND MIXED PLASTICS BOTH OF WHICH WOULD EXPORT QUITE A BIT TO TO CHINA OVER THE YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THE BAND. A POINT FIVE PERCENT CONTAMINATION RATE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL OTHER ALLOWABLE RECYCLABLE IMPORTS. THIS STANDARD IS EXTREMELY HARD TO ME. ON BUYER FACILITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. SO WHAT IS POINT FIVE CONTAMINATION RATE LOOK LIKE IN SOMETHING LIKE A BALLOT CARDBOARD WHAT CAN BE. A LOT OF THINGS FROM LABELS TAPE TO BELL WIRE TO SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE HARD TO SORT OUT OF MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES. LIKE FILM PLASTIC AND OTHER THINGS. IN ADDITION TO THE POINT FIVE PERCENT CONTAMINATION RATE. CHINA ALSO LIMITED IMPORT LICENSES INCREASED INSPECTIONS AT THE PORT. MAKING IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT OUR MATERIALS THERE. SO THESE POLICIES WERE INTRODUCED ON TO CLEAN UP AND PRESERVE CHINA'S ENVIRONMENT AS I'VE MENTIONED. IN OCTOBER IT CHINA'S NINETEENTH ANNUAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT SHE'S IN PAIN MENTION THE ENVIRONMENT EIGHTY NINE TIMES WHILE ONLY MENTIONING THE ECONOMY SEVENTY TIMES IN HIS SPEECH. SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THEM PACKS OF NATIONAL SORT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MARY MATERIALS I NO LONGER HAVE MARKETS ARE STOCKPILING AT OUR SOLID WASTE FACILITIES. IN SOME CASES MATERIALS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPORTED ARE NOW BEING SENT TO LANDFILL. JURISDICTIONS HOLLERS AND SOLID WASTE FACILITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN'T RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH NATIONAL SORT. STRATEGIES LIKE WASTE PREVENTION. UPDATING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT CAN BE PLACED IN THE BROUGH BEN. INCREASING PROCESSING MATERIALS THAT MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES TOURS REDUCE CONTAMINATION CAN ALL RESULT IN CLEANER MATERIAL. BUT THE STRATEGIES COSTS A LOT OF MONEY INTO NOT FULLY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM WITH OUR RELIANCE ON EXPORTS MARKET. GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER DID CAN WHO WILL NOW ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING RESILIENCE RECYCLING PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WEEK BEFORE. THAT WE SHIFT OVER. DO YOU HAVE ANY STATISTICSOR PROJECTIONS ON WHAT THE REDUCTION. AND RECYCLING FOR VARIOUS MATERIALS WILL BE AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. MAY BE YOU KNOW BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN AND. WHEREVER AND WE END UP AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY NINE SOMETHING. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT WE STARTED RECEIVING SOME JUST. PRELIMINARY DATA ON WHITE ON OUR EXPORTS ARE PROJECTED TO BE OUT TO THE. TO THE NEXT YEAR AND IT'S NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD FOR MATERIALS LIKE. CARDBOARD IN MIXED PAPER PARTICULARLY ON SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT. OUR OVERALL RECYCLING WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE ON. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL WE HAVE SOME MORE. STABILIZATION IN THE MARKETS OVERALL. ON. WITH THAT SAID WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND OTHER MEASURES TO INCREASE ORGANICS RECYCLING. ARM SO IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE MIGHT SEE. SWING EN AN UPSWING IN OUR RECYCLING RATE. ON ALSO IF WERE ABLE TO FIND SOME SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES WITH IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN SEE WE CAN UP TO SEE THAT AS WELL FOR SOME THESE OTHER MATERIALS THAT WE'VE. TRADITIONALLY RELIED ON THE EXPERTS MARKET. THANK YOU. SO. WITH MORE MATERIAL STAYING CALIFORNIA MAJOR FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE AND THAT SORT OF LACK OF A DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS WE NEED TO HAVE CLEARLY MORE RESILIENT. RECYCLING PROGRAMS CLEAN MATERIAL. IN STATE PROCESSING IN REMANUFACTURING UNSTRUNG DIVERSIFIED MARKETS ARE ARE THOSE CRITICAL COMPONENTS SO IF WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. THROUGH THE LENS OF THESE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS A I THINK IT IS SOME OF THESE IDEAS. COME CLEAR FIRST. THE DEPOSIT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THAT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR CONSUMERS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO BRING BACK THAT BEVERAGE CONTAINER TO RECYCLING SAN BRING THAT MATERIAL. THIS ENSURES A CLEANER COLLECTION AND AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SCRAP VALUE THAN WHAT'S COLLECTED AT CURBSIDE AND WE'VE HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE THE QUALITY OF THAT THAT MATERIAL IN THE CONCERNS THERE BOTH. TERMS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE MATERIAL COMING. THE MATERIAL PAPER ONE COLLECTED A CURB SIDES EASILY CONTAMINATED AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGH SINGLE STRING COLLECTION PROGRAMS. SECOND. THE PBP PROGRAM SUPPORTS THAT IN STATE REMANUFACTURING CREEK BY PROVIDING THOSE SUBSIDIES TO RECLAIM RISEN MANUFACTURES USE RECYCLED PLASTIC OVER VIRGIN MATERIAL. AND TO HELP COMPETE WITH THOSE OVERSEAS MARKETS PART OF PROGRAM STARTING IN FACT WE WERE EXPORTING ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF OF P. ET NOW IT'S ONLY FIFTY PERCENT. LASTLY AND AS YOU'LL RECALL FROM HIS HOWLERS COMMENTS TWO THIRDS MATERIAL GOING INTO THE BLUE BIN. IS EXPORTED THAT'S ARTHUR CONCEPT IS CREATING MARKET DEMAND TO POLICIES LIKE PMT P. AND MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT THEY CAN HELP BUILD RESILIENT RECYCLING PROGRAMS FOR THOSE MISTER MATERIALS. THAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY EXPORTED ELSEWHERE. SO IF WE HAD SIMILAR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALS THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT WE COULD REDUCE OUR EXPORTS AND BUILD UP OUR DOMESTIC REMANUFACTURING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DIVERSIFIED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE JUST LAST YEAR WE EXPORTED FOUR MILLION TONS OF CARDBOARD. THE CHINA. WITHOUT ROBUST DOMESTIC REMANUFACTURING OF MARKETS CARDBOARD WOULD WILL LIKELY BE DESTINED FOR DISPOSAL. THE SAME GOES FOR OTHER MATERIAL TYPES. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THE NATIONAL SORT IS GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. COLLECT SORT AN EXPORT IS NO LONGER A VIABLE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT SAID WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND A CHALLENGE TO REDEFINE RECYCLING. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS FOR ALL MATERIALS. SO IN IN CLOSING I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE CRITICAL AND KEY ELEMENTS HERE THIS IS A THIRTY YEAR OLD PROGRAM IT HAS STATUTES THAT ARE THAT ARE RATHER RIGID AND ANDWE HAVE LIMITED FLEXIBILITY TO TO ADDRESS THIS. TOOK TO ACCOMMODATE AT. WE DID AS MR MURRAY RIGHTLY POINTS OUT EXERCISING REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF THE REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE OPTIONS ELSEWHERE. MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW WE ESTABLISH PAYMENTS REQUIRE A LOOK BACK THAT IT THAT IS NOT CONTEMPORARY WITH WHAT'S EXACTLY HAPPENING WITH THE MARKET. THERE'S A NEED TO LOOK AT CONVENIENCE BASED ON THE UNIQUE REGIONS. WITHIN CALIFORNIAN THAT COULD ALLOW FOR APPROACHES THAT A MORE SUSTAINABLE ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT TO ASK BEFORE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WE'RE IMPLEMENTING NOW WILL ALLOW US TO EXPLORE SOME PILOT PROGRAMS. ON CONVENIENCE IN COLLECTION MODELS. WERE CONDUCTING WORKSHOPS RIGHT NOW ON THAT TO TO GARNER SOME INTERESTING IDEAS AND AND WILL BEGIN MOVING THAT FORWARD OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WHERE WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT. MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK YOU TO SUSTAIN MARKETS HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED. MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT IS ONE WAY GETTING US THERE RISK REQUIRING CONTAINERS TO INCLUDE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED MATERIAL PROVIDES A CONSISTENT MARKET DEMAND IS MORE INSULATED FROM INTERNAL MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. MORE BROADLY IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT CIRCULAR ECONOMY THAT CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS OUR PURSES TO DEVELOP DOWNSTREAM MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS LIKE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. PROGRAM TO COLLECT SORT OF CREATE MORE DIVERSIFIED MARKETS ADDITIONALLY WE CAN LOOK UPSTREAM TEA IS LESS MATERIALS MAKE SMARTER CHOICES ON THE MATERIALS THAT WE DO USE. I'M A CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE POLICIES IN WHICH MATERIAL. IS ACCEPTABLE OR WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THAT. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LEFT WITH THE HARD DECISIONS TO MANAGE THESE MATERIALS THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT AND REGRETTABLY WILL END UP IN THE LANDFILL. I'M EITHER HERE OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES ON. SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WILL RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU WELL I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS JUMP BUTTON TO ACT I THINK. INDIFFERENCE TO THE OUR. I'M GONNA. RESTRAIN MYSELF LISTED ON AND. OBVIOUSLY. A WE NEED A LOT OF WORK ON THIS PROGRAM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONTINUING. DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW ON. ON THIS ISSUE. OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL ON MATTRESS RECYCLING SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. IT WAS VERY CLEVER THE MEMBERS. TONY GONZALEZ REPRESENTING TOLERATE NORTH AMERICA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AYE TONY GONZALEZ REPRESENTING. THOMAN EARTH AMERICA WE'VE TALKED A GREAT DEAL BUT CONVENIENCE AND MODERNIZING THE PROGRAM. ONE OF THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOL BOX IS WHAT IS COMMONLY DONE IN AND THROW MOST OF NORTH AMERICA AND IN EUROPE WHERE. WE HAVE VERY ADVANCED DEPOSITS SYSTEMS WHICH IS GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY REVERSE VENDING MACHINES. WE SAW SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF WHAT IS BEING DONE IN OREGON. HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT AT ALL VERY COMMONLY USED THROUGHOUT. MOVES TO DEPOSIT SYSTEMS UNITED STATES MY ONLY COMMENT HERE IS THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN OUR STATUTE TO. GREATER INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF OUR OF YAMS. CLEARING AWAY SOME OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THE STATUTE THAT REALLY PRECLUDE THEIR USE IN CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. IN THE STATE THAT. WE COULD USE A LOT MORE THAT WOULD ADDRESS MANY THE ISSUES IN THE. RURAL AREAS IN URBAN AREAS SUCH AS FRESNO WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE CONVENIENT DROP US SYSTEMS THAT DO PROVIDE. NOT ONLY A. MECHANISM FOR DEBATE. FOR REDEMPTION BUT ACTUALLY A TRUE PAYMENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE PAID BY COUNT. PER BOTTLE AS OPPOSED TO THE WEIGHT IN WHICH THAT NORMALLY THE CONSUMER WILL GET SHORT CHANGED SOME DEGREE. BY BRINGING THE MATERIAL BY WEIGHT AND WITH THOSE COMMENTS WE LOOK FOR WORKING WITH STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS TO SORT THIS OUT THIS YEAR. MISTER CHAIRMAN AS THE COMMITTEE UPPALA TREAT ON BEHALF OF CPR SEE IF THE PLASTIC RECYCLERS COALITION. SO. ON YOUR LIST WE WERE LISTED AS PROCESSORS WERE ALSO CALLED PROCLAIMERS AND RECYCLERS SO WERE THE ONES THAT TAKE THAT FINAL OF BENEFIT OF A OF A PLASTIC BOTTLES AND. WE TAKE THOSE WE STERILIZE AND TURN THEM INTO A PRODUCT BE MADE AGAINST WITH THE END OF THE LINE. BEFORE IT BECOMES SOMETHING NEW AGAIN SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE BEEN LITERALLY WE'VE ALREADY LOST ONE THERE'S ONLY FIVE OTHERS BIG ONES IN THE STATE. AROUND THAT DEAL WITH THESE PRODUCTS WE NEED TO HAVE MINIMUM CONTENT NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE CONSIDERING IN YOUR COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW BUT WE NEED SUPPORTED. AND TO THAT PM DE PAYMENTS BACK. THOSE WERE STARTED YEARS AGO ALSO BE SENDING YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THOSE BUT THERE THE GAP THAT WE NEED BEFORE OUR GUYS LITERALLY GO UNDER IF WE CAN'T GET MINIMUM CONTENT. SO WILL BE SENDING YOU MORE ARE IN STATE GREEN JOBS. AND THE LAST CYCLE FOR A CLOSELY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M KELLY ASKED HER WITH THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL THE SERGEANT IS DISTRIBUTING AB. VERY BRIEF WHITE PAPER THAT WE HAPPEN TO PREPARE ON THIS TOPIC OF NATIONAL SOARED. I I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M DELIGHTED WITH OF MS. HELL IS PRESENTATION AND VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT. WE ARE DISCUSSING THE VAT ALONGSIDE THE MATTRESS IN THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM ISSUE. I DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS IN MIND BUT I'M GUESSING OF THE THIRTY SWEET. DISPOSE OF SOME THIRTY SEVEN MILLION TONS OF MATERIAL EVERY YEAR. WHILE THE BOTTLE BILL FIXES ARE NECESSARY. AND WE CAN PERHAPS AGREE ON SOME WHAT THOSE OUGHT TO BE A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM IS LOOMING AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM OF NATIONAL SOARED. THE MEMBERS OF C. R. SEE ARE THE MURPH OPERATORS OF FOLKS WHO BUILT FINANCE CONSTRUCTED THESE OF FACILITIES AND FEED THEM THROUGH THE COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. THEY LITERALLY ARE FINDING NO HOME. FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MATERIAL THAT FORMALLY HAD A HOME. IN THE CITY THE LAW IS NOT CURRENTLY. DESTRUCTIVE IN THE WAY TO ADDRESS THAT THE ASSUMPTION THAT WAS MADE WITH NINE THIRTY NINE WAS IT MARKETS WOULD ALWAYS BE THERE THE SUDDEN. AND PROFOUND CRASH IN THOSE MARKETS MEANS THAT EVEN. THERE'S A CLASS OF MATERIAL WE CAN'T EVEN PAY TO GET RID OF. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT IT'S A VERY SHORT TERM IMMEDIATE PROBLEM I'D LOVE ONE DAY FOR THERE TO BE A RESILIENT. RECYCLING SYSTEM LIKE IS DESCRIBED. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF DOMESTIC MARKETS WERE COMPLETELY AT THE MERCY. OF A AT EAST ASIAN MARKETS AND THOUGH THEY'RE SHOWING SOME. UNWILLINGNESS SUDDENLY TO ACCEPT MATERIAL FROM US AND THERE'S NO OPTION BUT TO DISPOSE OF WHAT I CALL THE EXCESS MATERIAL. THAT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT EXCEEDS OUR ABILITY TO STORE ON SITE AT A RECYCLING FACILITY. WHERE IS HARMED OR MORE SO THAN ANYBODY BY THAT FACT IT'S AN UGLY FACT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS? WE'LL TO BECOMING FOUR DO YOU IN THE NEAR FUTURE WAS PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. CHAIR. MISTER PATTERSON. MARKET PRAYER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. YOUR STAFF WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HEARING IS THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION NOT A BROADER CONVERSATION NOT JUST ABOUT THE BOTTLE BILL AND. MATTRESS RECYCLING BUT HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB. OF A RECYCLING ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO I WANNA. ADDRESS BOTH A BOTTLE BILL BUT ALSO. SOME OF BROADER ISSUES. SO AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THE THE. CURRENT BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY NOT PERFECT BUT IT. IT CERTAINLY HAS ACCOMPLISHED MUCH GOOD. IN TERMS OF IT'S RECYCLING RATE IN THE AMOUNT OF BOTTLE. BEVERAGE CONTAINERS RECYCLE. THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO PROVIDED A VALUABLE REVENUE STREAM THAT HAS HELPED FINANCE MUCH OF OUR CURRENT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE REVISED AND UPDATED BUT CERTAINLY NOT. NOT ABANDONED. I IN RESPONSE TO A BE NINE THIRTY NINE IN RESPONSE TO THE BEVERAGE CONTAINING CONTAINER RECYCLING ACT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANDTHE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN PROGRAMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACHIEVE THE RECYCLING RATES THAT WE CURRENTLY ENJOY. BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT SOME THE OTHER PUBLIC POLICIES THAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FOR INSTANCE. THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB THREE THREE FORTY ONE BY MISTER CHESBRO WHICH ESTABLISHED A STATE OF POLICY GOAL THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF SOLID WASTE GENERATED BE DIVERTED BY. FROM LANDFILL DISPOSAL BY TWENTY TWENTY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX THAT PHASES IN REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERATORS OF ORGANIC WASTE. TO ARRANGE RECYCLING SERVICES FOR THAT MAKE MATERIAL OF BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THROUGH JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND. NINE NINETEEN WERE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF IMPLEMENTING. THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT REPUBLIC SERVICES WAS AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF THAT MEASURE. AMONG OTHER THINGS SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE STATES THAT METHANE. EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS SHALL INCLUDE TARGETS TO REDUCE THE LANDFILL DISPOSAL OF ORGANIC WASTE FIFTY PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY. AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LEVELS. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED HAVE IMPOSED A. A TOUGH BURDEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT RECYCLERS WASTE HAULERS IN OUR RATE PAYERS. WE ARE CONFRONTING THE DEMAND TO BUILD MORE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FACE OF TOUGHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS DIMINISH MARKETS. AND A LACK OF LONG TERM STATE FUNDING SUPPORT. ACCORDING TO RICH CAL RECYCLED THE PRIVATE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BUILT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ACTIVE ANAEROBIC DIGESTION COMPOST FACILITIES IN THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. ORGANICS REDUCTION GOALS ASSEMBLY IT S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE WILL NEED TO SITE FINANCE. PERMIT AND BUILD AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT NUMBER OF FACILITIES IN THE NEXT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. AT A COST OF AROUND THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THUS FAR NO ONE HAS PROPOSED A PERMITTING PROCESS. NOR OFFER THE NEED CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO ACHIEVE ORGANIC REDUCTION GOALS LAID OUT IN S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. SO AS WE LOOK FOR A LOOK TO A DEPRESSED ADDRESSED RECYCLING IN A BROAD SENSE. FOR. NOT ONLY BEVERAGE CONTAINERS MATTRESSES. OTHER CONTAINERS BUT THAT ACROSS THE BOARD WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THE SUCCESSES THAT WE'VE HAD. BE MINDFUL THAT THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE WITH THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED. AND. ENSURE THAT NEW POLICIES DO NOT LEAVE SOLID WASTE INVESTMENTS IN ASSETS STRANDED. I WE WE COMMIT TO YOU AND TO THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THAT WILL BE YOUR PARTNER IN DEVISING ANY FUTURE POLICIES AND FIGURING OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AT RECYCLING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CHAIRMAN BLOOM PATTERSON ON MICROBES HERE ON BEHALF THE GLASS PACKAGING INSTITUTE ON REPRESENT THE. GLASS BOTTLE MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. AND THERE IS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION IN CLASS TODAY AND I AND AND I THINK I'M A LOT OF THE PREVIOUS ON. TESTIMONY HIT ON A LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK WERE WERE ALL FAIRLY ACCURATE AND COUPLE THINGS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY RAISED. AND. DISCUSSION IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND FROM THE LA OWN IN EVEN A LITTLE BIT FOR MR MURRAY ABOUT. MANUFACTURES PAIN HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE COST OF RECYCLING OR YOU KNOW CLOSE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT THE COST RECYCLING JUST FOR ITS A PERTAINS THE GLASS CONTAINER INDUSTRY ONE IT AND. KNOW THAT WE BELIEVE WE DO THAT ALREADY I MEAN THERE IS A PROCESSING FEE OFFSET. AND SHOULD WIN WIN THE RECYCLING RATE GOES DOWN OUR PROCESSING FEE OFFSET IS REDUCED MEANING OUR PROCESSING FEE IS MORE. THAT'S WE PAY ON THE FRONT END AND TO SUPPORT. THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE ALSO PAY ON THE BACK END SO WE IT WE ARE WE ARE THE AND MORE WE ARE THE PRIMARY AND MARKET AND MR MURRAY MADE THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW FIFTY. APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF GLASS BOTTLES AND. AND. APPROXIMATELY. FIFTY PERCENT OF A GLASS BOTTLES MADE UP OF RECYCLED MATERIAL. AND THEM AND AND THAT'S THE END USER WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT CALL IT WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT RECYCLED GLASS. AND SO WHATEVER IT COSTS FOR THE FOR THE HOLLER THE RECYCLER AND THE PROCESSOR TO GET US THAT PRODUCT WE'RE PAYING FOR IT WEEKS WE PAY A PREMIUM FOR QUITE FURNACE READY QUALITY COLOR SO SO I JUST WANTED KNOW THAT THAN THE MARKET. FLEX. THAT COSTS WE ARE PAYING FOR IT INTO WE PAID IN THE FRONT AND WE PAY THEM THE BACK. AND MISTER KING ASSEMBLYMAN TING ASKED I'M ABOUT THE. RATE OF RECYCLING FOR GLASSON AND UNFORTUNATELY HE LAUGHED I'M I THINK ALL THE ANSWERS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ON THAT THE OTHER MATERIAL TYPES ARE ARE WIDER EASIER TO MOVE ALL THOSE ARE ALL. ACCURATE ACCURATE A. RESPONSES IT'S BUT IT'S ON. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID THAT AT ONE POINT AND IT WAS IT WAS MENTIONED BY SOMEBODY THAT. YOU KNOW THE THE ROOM THE RECYCLING RATE FOR ALUMINUM WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT A HUNDRED PERCENT AT ONE POINT SO SO YOU KNOW IF YOU GET TO TAKE SOME THIS RECYCLING RATE STAFF IN. PUT IT INTO IN A BIGGER CONTEXT ANYTHING MISTER DRAWS A HIT ON IT IS THAT. DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN LAST YEAR'S OF RATCHETING DOWN ON FRAUD IN SO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RECYCLING RATE FOR WOMEN TO HAVE EVER BEEN A FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT BUT IT WAS. AND SO THEY THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF TAKING A MATERIAL LIKE PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM WHICH ARE VERY LIGHT EASY TO MOVE ACROSS STATE LINES AND BRING IN THE CALIFORNIAN RECYCLE IT. IF YOU'RE IN ARIZONA OR WHATNOT. YOU KNOWN SURPRISINGLY NOW OREGON HAS A TEN CENT DEPOSIT. SO. YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS MAYBE SOME OF THAT SOME OF OUR ALL THIS MATERIAL COULD BE MOVING ORGAN FOR ALL WE KNOW IT AGAIN THE TIME INSTEAD OF A NICKEL. SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND AND. AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW RECYCLING RATES. YOU KNOW REFLECT LIKE MR GROWTH OF SAID A LOT OF DIFFERENT OTHER THEM ITEMS TOOK THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN A SIMILAR PATTERSON JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY I THOUGHT SET A VERY GOOD START ANYMORE REPRESENTING REPLY THAT. THE LARGEST CAN BE IT'S AN RECYCLING THE STATE. I THINK THE HEARING SET A WONDERFUL BASS LINE IN TERMS OF OUR HAVING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND WHERE WE'RE STARTING OFF AT THIS POINT IN TIME. OUT AND THEN JUST TWO QUICK POINTS ONE ON THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE. AND THEN THE OTHER GENERALLY. WITH REGARD TO THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES IN THE STATE. ON THE FIRST POINT. AS YOU'VE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN ARE RECYCLERS WERE NOT. BUT PROPERLY COMPENSATED FOR THE TREMENDOUS DEBT BEEN COMMODITIES PRICES. AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS IN OUR STATES PROGRAM WE PROBABLY DON'T ADEQUATELY TIE THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES TO HOW RECYCLERS ARE COMPENSATED. YOU HEARD WHAT MR MURRAY SAY EARLIER THAT. RECYCLERS ARE ARE OFTEN REALLY PRIMARILY COMPENSATED. BASED ON THEIR OWN COSTS WHICH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE THIS MODERNIZE PROGRAM WE WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT. FOR RECOGNIZING THAT. THIS FALL AND ACTING VERY QUICKLY TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION AND HELP MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SECOND POINT IS ON THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND AND THAT IS. WE IN THE STATE. I HAVE LOST A TON OF THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO REINVEST IN THAT. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF COURSE OF OUR CURB SIDE PROGRAMS AND THAT IS A VERY CONVENIENT OPTION. ON FOR MANY CONSUMERS BUT FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE PAID A NICKEL OR A DIME. FOR A CONTAINER AND THEY WANT TO GET THAT MONEY BACK. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CONVENIENT PLACE TO COMPETE IN PLACE TO GO TO GET THAT MONEY BACK IT CONSTITUTES A TAX FOR THOSE CONSUMERS. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE OR EVEN INCENTIVIZE. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT TO CLOSE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONE LAST QUICK POINT IF I MIGHT WITH REGARD TO THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THE PROGRAM IS NOW PRIMARILY PLASTIC. AND IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE A HIGH COMMODITIES PRICES SO THE PROGRAM PAYS ALL OF US A LOT LAST FOR THE COST OF RECYCLING AND SO CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY PAY LESS FOR THAT COST OF RECYCLING. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR PLASTIC INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT WAS WITH PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MELISSA AND MO WITH CHAU YOUR ANTI HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA. I JUST WANNA OUT OUR VOICE TO THE CHORUS AND TO SAY THAT AS WE EVALUATE THE STATE'S AND FUTURE OF RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEMS AND WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR STATE A SENSE ASSISTANCE WITH DEVELOPING IN STATE MARKETS. AND INFRASTRUCTURE ON PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF FOURTH CAME FORTH COMING STATE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THOSE ESTABLISHED BY SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. I'M AND ALSO THE HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON SOME OF OUR LARGEST EXPORT MARKETS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT STAY ASSISTANCE INCLUDE FUNDING FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. ASSISTANCE WITH PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S AMEND POLICY IS THE HOPE OF SOURCE REDUCTION AND GETTING AT THE ISSUE OF PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY SO WE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING AS WE MOVE FORWARD THINK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN BUYERS I'M AARON EVANS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AS YOU'VE HEARD BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE INVESTED MULTI MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN MANY DIFFERENT AND NUMEROUS TYPES OF RECYCLING PROGRAMS. I CURBSIDE RECYCLING REMAINS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AS TO THE THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM AND OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAMS AS WELL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ON SOLUTIONS. TO THE DECLINING RECYCLING RATES I'M INCLUDING UP POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE CONTAINER TYPES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RALPH SIMONI REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA. BUT PLEASE ALLOW ME TO COMMEND YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. OF HOPEFULLY MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WILL THAT YOU'VE SPARKED THE DISCUSSION HER DIALOGUE AMONGST US HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO UP MAKE SOME OF THE TWEAKS AND SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS. ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF THE METRICS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY TODAY A LOT OF NUMBERS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THAT OUR RECYCLING RATE IS HOVERING IN THE EIGHTY PERCENT LEVEL. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENT'S QUARTERLY REPORT THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY THEY HAD AND EIGHTY POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AND THE LOOK IN AND THE LA OWE A REPORT THAT WAS GIVEN OUT THIS MORNING. IT WAS I THINK THE QUOTE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT CHAU YES WE ARE BELOW THE ALL TIME HISTORIC HIGHS. SOME OF THAT MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A CONTRACTION OF RECYCLING CENTERS SOME OF IT MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO. OF IT MORE GLOBAL A ELEMENTS LIKE PEOPLE BEING MORE FLUENT DURING THIS CURRENT TIME SO. WE NEED TO EVALUATE THAT. VERY CRITICALLY UP IF I MIGHT I'D ALSO LIKE TO DISCUSS THE OF THE RECYCLING CENTERS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S. IN IMPORTANT POINT AND I DON'T WANNA. SHE JUST THAT THERE ARE TOO FEW OR TOO MANY BUT IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S A BALANCE IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS AND DEMANDS AND BETWEEN WHAT THE PROGRAM CAN'T AFFORD? A HUB COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION COMMISSIONED A STATEWIDE POLL. ACTUAL INTERVIEWS A PRIOR TO GOING OUT IN THE FIELD WE HAD ASSEMBLYMAN THEN ASSEMBLYMAN RICH GORDON VET THE QUESTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE FAIR AND NOT SKEWED. OF ONE OF THE PRIME COMPONENTS OF THAT PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY WAS. WHAT DOES THAT GENERAL PUBLIC WANT AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THERE WERE TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE? WHO FREQUENTLY USED RECYCLING CENTERS AND ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT? THAT OCCASIONALLY. WE THEN ASKED THE QUESTION A BALLOT CURBSIDE AND AS I RECOLLECT THE NUMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH CAL RECYCLE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE POLICY CONSULTANT. THE CURBSIDE. ROUGH FRENCH WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE THIRTY SEVEN TO THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT FREQUENT. AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO PERCENT. OCCASIONALLY SO IT IT IT IS A MATTER OF CONSUMER CHOICE QUITE FREQUENTLY WHETHER THEY WANT TO DONATE OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO RETRIEVE THEIR NICKEL AND AGAIN I'M NOT ARGUING FOR ONE OR THE OTHER. BUT CLEARLY THEY HAVE TO BE A TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A ALSO CAL RECYCLE IS DOING ITS. BUT YOU HAVE THE UC STUDY THAT CAN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DUE IN AUGUST. WE'RE STILL AWAITING THAT THAT ALSO INCLUDES SOME SURVEY DATA HOPEFULLY IT WILL VALIDATE. WHAT WE HAVE A GENERATED UGH JUST TOP LINE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS? MARK MURRAY HAS AND OTHERS HAD MENTIONED THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT. OF MY CLIENTS TOTALLY ENDORSE THAT. HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO EVEN CHANGE THAT RATHER THAN A STATIC. PM DE. HOW BOUT A DYNAMIC PMD SO WHEN THE COST OF VIRGIN AND OR PET? ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. THE RECLAIMER SHE WOULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL PSALMS BEYOND THAT TEN MILLION MAYBE HAVE IT ELASTIC WORK COULD BE UP TO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TO ADJUST FOR THAT GAP. CONVERSELY WHEN THE PRICE OF VIRGIN AND OUR PET ARE. QUITE DIFFERENT MAYBE AS THEY ARE TODAY. YOU GO DOWN TO A MUCH LESSER AMOUNTS OF THEIR WAYS TO HELP. OF RECYCLING CENTERS ARE. JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. ABOUT ONE TO DEPARTMENT ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IN DECEMBER COUNT AS I RECOLLECT. THAT. CHANGERS THE REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS. AND. PLUGS INTO A NUMBER OF ELEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. FOR URBAN AND SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT OR SOMETHING PERCENT REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURN FOR RURAL LOCATIONS. OF. MY CLIENTS SUPPOSED THAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER WHICH ARGUABLY WAS SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY AND NOT TIED TO ANYTHING SPECIFIC BUT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE A COMPONENT. TO EXPAND THE REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT WAS A FOCUS OF THIS. HEARING EARLIER SHOW I THINK WE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY THERE BUT. YOU KNOW IF WE NEED A MORE ROBUST CENTER TO RECALIBRATE AND REBALANCE THE DESIRE TO GO CURBSIDE VERSUS REDEMPTION CENTER A CLEARLY THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT I JUST CLOSE WITH A POINT OF OPTIMISM. SHOES AND HAD MENTIONED IT. MY CLIENTS HAVE SUPPORTED WHAT MARK MARIE HAD PROPOSED. EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE TO FIXTURES THAT THAT CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH AND ALSO. WE'VE SUPPORTED. STABILIZING THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT AND MAKE IT MORE ROBUST SO HOPEFULLY THERE'S A HEARING WILL SPARK THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN PARAFFIN A JURY WHO LEAVE ON BEHALF OF OWENS ILLINOIS THE LARGEST GLASS CONTAINER RECYCLING COMPANY IN THE WORLD. LIKE MR MURRAY EXACTLY DONE THE THINGS. THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM AND I HAVE TO. PICK UP ON A QUICK COMMENT MISTER PATTON THAT YOU MADE WHEN YOU THAT WHAT ABOUT A FOURTH CONTAINER. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHAT WE DID SEPARATE PAPER LAUGH ENHANCED. AND THE REAL CONTAMINATION WITH LAP THAT THE CURRENT HE IS WHEN IT PICKED UP A CURB TIED. THE BROKEN GLASS AND BAD IN THE PAPER. AND THAT DIDN'T MAKE THAT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MY CLIENT TO RECEIVE QUALITY COLOR WHICH BY THE WAY WE DEPEND ON. TO LOWER OUR CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION COME COMMITTEE BEEN VERY FOCUSED APPROPRIATELY ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE. DEPENDENT ON HIGH QUALITY COLOR IT IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE WE WANT THAT CLEAN COAL IT STREAM BUT FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET BY THE WAY A QUICK COMPARISON WITH OREGON. NO THE ROOF MENTION THAT WE PAID THE BACK END WE'RE PAYING THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER. QUEEN CULLITON CALIFORNIA THEN THEY'RE PAYING THE MIGHT COMPANY OF PAYING IN OREGON. I DON'T KNOW WHY AREAS BUT WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR HIGH QUALITY COLOR. THE YET TO THAT POINT AGAIN WE NEED TO EXPLORE EITHER REMOVING GO LAUGH OR REMOVING PAPER FROM THAT CURB TRIED BEEN SO THAT YOU GET A HIGH QUALITY CALLED THAT WE NEED IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH. OTHER MATERIAL TYPE OF NOT A PROBLEM WOULD YOU CAN BUY WITH THE PAPER YOU GET THE CONTAMINATION THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE. THE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR GROUP WORK. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMING BACK IN A FEW MINUTES. BUT WE WILL NOW SHIFT OVER TO OUR. INFORMATIONAL ISSUE TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINNING WITH A BRIEF PRESENTATION BY ASHLEY AIMS AT THE LA AUTO. APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO SAY BRIEF BUT. WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF TIME PRETTY SOON SO WE HAVE TO MOVE IT ALONG. PLEASE. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER HAUSMAN GOOD MORNING ACTUALLY AIMS WITH THE. ALEJO. SO SO MUCH BEFORE THERE'S A BAND OUT ON THE ROAD KIND OF JUST BE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW FOR YOU BUT PLEASE. FEEL FREE TO STOP AND ASK QUESTIONS AS WE GO ALONG. PERSONAL JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROGRAM AND AND WHAT THE STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE. THEN SECONDLY I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BASIS OF THE PROGRAM WAS WHICH IS THE IDEA BEHIND IT EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. THIRD WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF MATCHES COLLECTION UNDER THE PROGRAM. FOURTH US OF THE MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND BEEN ABLE TO BE REUSED. AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING OUT OF THE BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND EACH. SO YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PITCH A. PROGRAM WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN STATUTE. AND IT'S ENGINE THE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MATTRESSES. AND SO WHAT I'M SAYING MATTRESSES I'M GONNA BE USING THAT ONE WHERE BUT ALSO DEFERRED A BOX. BOX SPRINGS FOUNDATIONS LIKE NOTHING TO. THE RECYCLED US LIKELY TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE NETWORK. OF COLLECTION CENTERS AND RECYCLING FACILITIES FOR MATTRESSES AND THEN THIRD TO TRY TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF MATCHES THAT ARE DUMPED ILLEGALLY. AND THOSE ASSOCIATED CLEAN UP COSTS. SO. PERCENT THE LEGISLATION THE MATTRESS PRODUCERS THROUGH THEIR INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION DEAD FORM THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL OR A MERCY. ON IN THERE THE ONE THAT RUNS THE ONLY CURRENTLY THE ONLY A PROGRAM ON THE HOUSE BEEN CERTIFIED BY CAL RECYCLE AYE WITHIN THE STATE RIGHT NOW. OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDED BY A FEE THAT CONSUMERS PAY IT WHEN THEY PURCHASE A NEW MATTRESS. ARE CURRENTLY THE FEE IS TEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS THAT IS HISTORICALLY BEEN ELEVEN DOLLARS AND WAS RECENTLY WERE. REVISED DOWN ON JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND THAT WAS BECAUSE EMARCY WAS PROJECTING A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. YEAR. I'M FINALLY THEM MAIN ROLE OF THE STATE THAN IN THIS INDUSTRY RUN SYSTEM IS MOSTLY A OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT AND INCOME RECYCLE TAKES CARE OF THAT. SO THEN ON THE SECOND PAGE. YOU KNOW THAT BASIS FOR THE PROGRAM IS EXTENT USERS POSSIBILITY OR. SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE A PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP AND SO JUST THE IDEA THAT THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE OUT OF SHOULD. THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THE COST OF THEIR I END OF LIFE EITHER DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING. AND. CONCEPTUALLY THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU REQUIRE THEM TO PAY FOR THE TOTAL LIFETIME COSTS THAT WOULD INCORPORATE WITHIN THE PRICE THAT'S PAID BY THE CONSUMER AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. TO COVER ALL THE COSTS MOVES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OTHER WASTE MANAGEMENT THAT PROGRAMS WHERE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TAXPAYERS WOULD TYPICALLY. A COVER THOSE COSTS THROUGH A WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. LOOK AT THE THIRD PAGE. THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT. COLLECTION METHODS THAT ARE UNDER THIS PROGRAM. THERE OPERATED A NETWORK OF NO COST DROP OFF SITES WHERE YOU CAN GO A DROP OFF YOUR MATCHES FOR FREE AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE. WAY THE MOST THE MATTRESSES ON THE STATE ARE COLLECTED. SECONDLY RETAILERS CAN OURS NEED TO OFFER TO TAKE ALL MATTRESSES BACK FREE OF CHARGE WITH A DELIVER A NEW MATTRESS. OF AND SO THAT'S THE SECOND MOST COMMON. AND THEN THIRDLY THEY DO OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVE UP FOR CONSUMERS TO TAKE THE MATTRESS I DIRECTLY TO RECYCLING CENTERS THEMSELVES ABOUT THREE DOLLARS. AND THERE'S ALSO AGREEMENTS WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF MATTRESSES. LIKE HOTELS FOR EXAMPLE ON IN THE VALLEY THERE'S. COLLECTION OF AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE ITEM THAT ARE HOSTED BY MRC. SO LOOKING AT THE FOURTH PITCH. TO SEE A SENSE OF SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT WE'VE COLLECTED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM FOR RE USE OF THEM. FEEL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF MATTRESSES THE LARGEST ONE IS OBVIOUSLY US STEEL WHICH MAKES A LOT MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT BY. WEIGHT. IN TOTAL OF FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FORTY SIX MILLION HOW THE MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED ABOUT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE THE RECYCLED OR. USES WASTE ENERGY AND ABOUT ONE QUARTER I WAS NUYS BLONDE ENOUGH GOING TO LANDFILLS. SHE'LL GET THE FIFTH PAGE. AYE MITCHELL BEFORE THAT THERE'S THE FEE THE FUNDS THE PROGRAMS IS HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE. A. PLAN TO BE SPENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO IMMERSE HIS BUDGET. CLEARLY THE LARGEST COST THERE IS THE OUT TRANSPORTATION IN THE PROCESSING OF THE MATTRESSES THEMSELVES. AND BUT THEY ALSO. BRING PLUCK XIN COMMUNICATION PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS. AND IN THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATION AND THEN THEY ALSO REIMBURSED CAO RECYCLE FOR THAT THE COST OF THE OVERSIGHT. I'M. SO WITH THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS HUNDRED ANSWER THOSE NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON TO. OUR REPRESENTATION FROM CAO RECYCLING EXTEND MISTER LEVINSON IS HERE. GIVE US THE REPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I AM HOWARD LEVINSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAL RECYCLE AND WITH ME IS CYNTHIA DONE. WHO SUPERVISES OUR CARPET PAINT MATTRESS NAM PROGRAMS? I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW. DESCRIBE OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE IN SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES RICK. INCLUDING RECOVERY RATE AND THE CONTRACTING ISSUES THAT ARE MENTIONED STAFF'S ANALYSIS I TRY NOT TO DUPLICATE. A WITNESS AND SAID TO THE EXTENT THAT I KANSEN NOW TIMES. OF THE ESSENCE HERE BUT I WANT TO START BY INDICATING THIS ACT. DOES FOLLOW A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH WHICH IS A DIFFERENT MODEL THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE BOTTLE BILL THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. THIS DOES PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ON IN THIS CASE THE MATTRESS RECYCLING ORGANIZATION. SPECIFICALLY THE MATCHES RECYCLING COUNCIL OR MRC. AND THEN. THE STATE. HAS OVERSIGHT ROLE IN THIS CASE. VESTED BY THE LEGISLATURE CAL RECYCLE. SO ONE CENTRAL PREMISE OF A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH IS THAT. STATE ARM THE GOVERNMENT'S DOES SET THE GOALS AND OTHER PROGRAM PARAMETERS AND PROVIDE THAT PROGRAM ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT. SO CAL RECYCLE IS TASKED WITH DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING. APPOINTING MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE POSTING LISTA COMPLIANT MANUFACTURERS. AND RENOVATORS AYE WE REVIEW AND APPROVE THE COUNCIL'S PLAN AND IT'S BUDGETS AND AND THE REPORTS. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO ESTABLISH STATE RECYCLING. STATE RECYCLING AND ENSURE THAT THE COUNCIL MAKES A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH THOSE GOALS AND FINALLY CONDUCT VARIOUS ON INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. I THINK THE SECOND PREMISE OF A PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY APPROACHES THAT THE. I IN THIS CASE THE MRC BUT THEN THE RECYCLING ORGANIZATION SET UP BY THE MANUFACTURERS. HAS CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO MEET THE STATUTORY DIRECTION. SO IN THIS CASE. IS MS AIM SAID MRC IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP FINANCE AND IMPLEMENT. A CONVENIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE COLLECTION TO RECOVER. AND RECYCLE I USE MATTRESSES THAT ARE GENERATED IN THE STATE. SO WE DID RECEIVE OF M. R. C.'S. PLAN FOR THIS PROGRAM IN JANUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN WE REALLY PROVED IT. IN JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN IN THE BASICS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE USING FUNDS FROM THE MATCHES RECYCLING CHARGE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION OUT REACHED PARTICIPANTS. ESTABLISHED NO COST COLLECTION SITES PROCESS COLLECTED UNITS THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH RECYCLERS. AND ESTABLISH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR REDUCING HIGH ILLEGAL DUMPING. EVERY JULY THE. MATTRESS YOU PSYCH COUNCIL HAS TO SUBMIT A BUDGET. FOR THE NEXT YEAR CALENDAR YEAR AND ITS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR. SO HAS MENTIONED. THE MRC DID SUBMIT A BUDGET THAT INCLUDED REDUCING THE MATTRESS CHARGE ARE THE YOU TO CHARGE PER UNIT. FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS DOWN TO TEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. I THIS SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE ADVISORY COUNCIL HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THIS REDUCTION. BECAUSE UP EVEN AFTER ONLY A YEAR AND A HALF OF IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE GAPS IN. OUR COLLECTION COVERAGE AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. CALVET SAKAL DID GO AHEAD AND APPROVE THAT. BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE MRC FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY ONE IS THAT THE REQUEST MET ALL THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS A STATUTE BUT. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN REVENUES BETWEEN THAT. LEVIN DOLLARS IN THE TEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS IS ABOUT ONLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. PROJECTED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE MRC HAS A RESERVE OF ROUGHLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SO IT HAS A SUBSTANTIAL. OF FUN THAT IT CAN DRAWN TO IT. USE FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES AT THIS POINT. I HAD THE MATCH THAT COUNSEL THEN SUBMITTED ITS. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND REPORT. IN MID YEAR MID TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS WAS THE PROGRAM'S FIRST REPORT. IT'S IMPORTANT OUT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAROF IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE PROGRAM. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CALENDAR YEAR AND ALSO THAT WE HAD NOT YET ESTABLISHED. THE RECYCLING BASELINE AND. GOALS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE DID REVIEW THAT PLAN AND LAST SEPTEMBER FOUND THAT THE PROGRAM IS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATUTE REGULATIONS. AND IS ACHIEVING MOST THE GOALS IN ITS PLAN. EVEN SO WHAT ARE WE DID IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES THAT WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM STILL NEEDS TO ADDRESS. AS IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND MATURE. IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS A OF JUST MENTION THREE IN PARTICULAR. ADEPTLY MORE COLLECTION SITES ARE NEEDED STATEWIDE PARTICULARLY AND RURAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS. SITUATION IS THAT NOT ALL SOLID WASTE FACILITIES TRANSFER STATIONS IT'S A TOUGH ONE TO ASSESS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT RIGHT NOW ON RENOVATORS PARTLY BECAUSE THE RENOVATORS THEMSELVES ARE NOT FULLY REPORTING TO US IN OUR OWN DATABASE. WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. AND THIRDLY THE. PROGRAM STILL NEEDS TO FURTHER ADDRESS ILL ILLEGAL DUMPING THIS IS STILL CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. AYE THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF PARTICIPATION FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AT THE EMBASSIES PUT FORTH BUT WE HOPE TO SEE THAT. BY INCREASING THE FUTURE. AT LAST NOVEMBER WE DID ESTABLISH THE STATE RECYCLING BASELINE AND GOALS ARE PURSUANT TO STATUTE. THOSE BECOME A FACTOR BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY. OF THIS YEAR. THOSE GOALS FOCUS ON INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING MAINTAINING THE NUMBER OF UNITS RENOVATED. AND INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE MATERIALS RECOVERED FROM RECYCLED MATTRESSES. I ONE THING TO NOTICE THAT WE DID NOT ESTABLISH STATEWIDE I'M RECYCLING PERCENTAGE RATE LIKE TRYING TO SHOOT FOR SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT RECYCLING RATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THAT KIND OF RATE REQUIRES TWO PIECES OF INFORMATION. HOW MANY MATTRESSES ARE COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING DIVIDED BY HOW MANY MATTRESSES ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION ON THE FIRST PROPONENT PART OF THAT? BUT WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON WHAT'S REALLY AVAILABLE HOW OFTEN PEOPLE BRING MATTRESSES OUT SO WE CAN'T REALLY CALCULATOR RECYCLING RATE AT THIS POINT. TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AND WE CAN. REVISIT THESE GOALS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN PURSUANT TO STATUTE. JUST A COUPLE MORE POINTS. TO MAKE. ONE IS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED ALMOST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY INSPECTIONS OF. RETAILERS AND RENOVATORS AND OTHER ENTITIES UNDER THE REGULATED UNDER LAW. SOME OF THE STILL HAVE SOME ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BUT ABOUT OVER THREE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. OF THOSE ABOUT A QUARTER WERE FULLY COMPLIANT HIGH IN THE INSPECTION THREE FORCE HAD SOME KIND OF VIOLATION IN THE FIGHT RANGE OF VIOLATIONS IS PRETTY WIDE AND. I GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT IF YOU NEED. A ANY OF THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE. RECEIVED A VIOLATION OUR INSPECTORS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY AND BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE THERE'S A AND EXPECTED DATE. FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT IS NOT PROVIDED TO THE BUSINESS AND IN MOST CASES THEY DO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IF THEY DON'T WE WILL. IMPOSE OR TAKE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT STEPS UP TO AND INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES BUT OUR GOAL IS. TO AVOID THAT BRING FOLKS INTO COMPLIANCE. LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE BLUE MARBLE MATERIAL SITUATION. WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF. THE CONCERNS THAT ABUSE BEEN EXPRESSED BY VARIOUS FOLKS ABOUT THAT CONTRACT A HOWEVER TO PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH CAL RECYCLED DOES NOT. INTERVENE IN CONTRACTING ISSUES IT'S REALLY A MATTER THAT'S BETWEEN. THE STEWARDSHIP THE MAN THE RECYCLING ORGANIZATION THIS CASE MRC AND ITS CONTRACTORS WE INSTEAD LOOK AT THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE RECYCLING ORGANIZATION OR IN THIS CASE THE MRC. AND MEETING THE VARIOUS GOALS UP PUT FORTH IN STATUTE AND INSPIRE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE HALF RIGHT NOW BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AND IT. SO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO. HERE FROM MIKE MCDONALD. OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL. WELCOME. IF YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CITY JOINING ME THIS MORNING THOSE. TIME SEE WITHOUT GREENBERG TARIK. WE SHAPE THE OPPORTUNITY. UP MY NAME IS MICHAEL DOT ON THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL OTHERWISE KNOWN AS M. ARE SEE. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN UPDATE ON OUR PROGRAM. WELL WE ARE START UP SO TO SPEAK WE'VE RD MADE TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS NOT SUPPORTING THE ENVIRONMENT BY RECYCLING MATERIALS. THAT ARE OTHERWISE LANDFILL IN CALIFORNIA. AND MERCY IS COMMITTED TO THE GOALS ESTABLISHED BY CAL RECYCLING WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY. S. B. TWO FIFTY FOR THE CALIFORNIA USED MATTRESS RECOVERY AND RECYCLING ACTIVE TWENTY THIRTEEN. AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S. LEADERSHIP AND THE POWER OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. AS YOU KNOW THE NONPROFIT MATTRESS RECYCLING COUNCIL WAS CREATED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM IT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO CAL RECYCLE. LAST DECEMBER NEVER SEE RELEASED ITS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT. IN REVEALED THAT PROGRAM RECYCLERS COLLECTED NEARLY ONE MILLION MATTRESSES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. DIVERTING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE MILLION POUNDS OF STEEL. FOAM FIBER AND WOOD FROM DISPOSAL IN CALIFORNIA LANDFILLS. IN JUST TWO YEARS OF OPERATION WE HAVE NOW COLLECTED OVER TWO MILLION MATTRESSES ACROSS THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY THE PROGRAM IS BEGINNING TO IDENTIFY AREAS WERE ILLEGAL MATTRESS DUMPING IS PREVALENCE WE CAN PROACTIVELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THE FIRST YEAR THE PROGRAM WE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ILLEGALLY DUMPED MATTRESSES THAT WERE REMOVED WE CALIFORNIA'S ALLEYS SIDEWALKS AND OTHER PUBLIC SPACES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE INCREASE THIS FIGURE BY OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. MRC IS ALSO A CONTRIBUTOR TO CALIFORNIA'S GREEN JOBS ECONOMY. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PROGRAM CONTRACTED WITH SIX RECYCLERS OPERATING ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LOCAL NONPROFITS SMALL AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE LIFE SKILLS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THE DIVERSE WORK FORCES. GROUPS LIKE THE INSTITUTES OF SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. ESTIMATE THAT FOREVER FOR EVERY TEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF MATERIAL RECYCLED. DOZENS OF JOBS ARE CREATED. AS THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW WERE EXPANDING RECYCLING CAPACITY IN INCREASING EFFICIENCY SO THAT MORE MATTRESSES AND MORE BOXSPRING TO BE RECYCLED. RECOVERED AND RECYCLED AT A LOWER PER UNIT COST. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS AND TRANSPARENCY WITH OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS. INTO THAT AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OUTLINED IN STAFF COMMENTS SECTION OF THE AGENDA. AND OTHER QUESTIONS WE HAVE RECEIVED DURING OUTREACH TO LEGISLATURE'S AND STAFF. FIRST AS HOWARD MENTIONED IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE'VE ONLY CHEAP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT COLLECTION RATE. THAT RATE IS DERIVED BY SIMPLY DIVIDE IN THE NUMBER OF MATTRESSES COLLECTED IN THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BY THE NUMBER OF MATTRESSES SOLD IN THE STATE THAT SAME YEAR. BY CALCULATION IS NOT ACCURATE. A MATTRESS IS NOT BOTTOM DISPOSED OF IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS ASSOCIATIONS CONSUMER RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF MATTRESS PURCHASES GENERATES A MATTRESS DISCARD. ALL MATTRESSES ARE NOT ALWAYS HEADED LANDFILLS SUMMER GIVEN TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY. MATTRESS REBUILD ITS PURCHASE SOME DIRECTLY FROM RETAILERS AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A STRONG EXPORT MARKETS MEXICO. I ACCURATE COLLECTION RATE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE NUMBER OF UNITS COLLECTED BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS DISCARDED AND STATE. NEITHER MRC OR CAL RECYCLE HAVE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF A REAL COLLECTION RATE UNTIL WE'VE HAD ENOUGH TIME. TO COLLECT DISCARD DATA FROM SOLID WASTE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. SECOND IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED WE ARE NOT INVESTING ENOUGH IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH THAT IS FALSE. MERCY IS A STRONG PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH AS A NEW ORGANIZATION. CONSUMERS KNOW WHERE EDUCATION PROGRAM IS BY BY MATTRESS. OUR ROBUST PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM CONSISTS OF POINT OF SALE MATERIALS. PAID TV ADVERTISING. RADIO PRINT MEDIA INTERNET AND BILLBOARDS AND DIGITAL MARKETING. BYE BYE MATTRESSES ALSO RECEIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FREE ADVERTISING. AND PUBLICITY VALUE FROM MEDIA COVERAGE PSAS AND GROUP GOOGLE AD GRANT. PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM BYE BYE MATCHES HIS FIRST EVER CONSUMER AWARENESS STUDY INDICATES FIFTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS KNOW THEIR MATTRESS CAN BE RECYCLED. THIS INCREDIBLE STATISTIC GIVEN OUR SHORT. I'M TIME FRAME IS AN ORGANIZATION. AND FINALLY WE BANKS MARKED OUR STRATEGY OUTREACH AGAINST OTHER SIMILAR RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE INVESTING THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUDGET HAS THERE'S. THIS DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T WANT TO MORE IN THE FUTURE BUT WE ARE CAREFUL TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES. APPROPRIATELY. THIRD IT IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT EVER SEE IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COMBAT ILLEGAL DUMPING IS REQUIRED BY S. B. TO FIFTY FOUR BUT SUCH A CONCLUSION IS PREMATURE PASSED. CALIFORNIA'S NEVER COLLECTED RELIABLE DATA ON MATTRESS DUMPING SWIMMERS HE WORKED WITH THE CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY CAO RECYCLE ILLEGAL DUMPING TASK FORCE AND THE MATTRESS ADVISORY TO DEVELOP. AN ILLEGALLY DUMPED MATTRESS COLLECTION INITIATIVE. THE CONCEPT AND PAYMENT STRUCTURE MRC PROPOSED WAS CLEARLY DESCRIBED IN OUR TWENTY FIFTEEN PROGRAM PLAN. THIS IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND APPROVED BY CAL RECYCLE. THE PRIMARY GOAL AT THIS EARLY POINT THE PROGRAM IS TO COLLECT ACCURATE DATA SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE DUMPING IS A PROBLEM. COLLECTING THIS DATA IS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES THE COOPERATION OF MINUTES A PALETTE IS ACROSS THE STATE. MRC HAS BUDGETED THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO RESEARCH THE PROBLEM IS PAYING COMMUNITIES FOR THE DATA THEY PROVIDE. AND OUR FIRST YEAR FORTY ENTITIES PARTICIPATED THIS INITIATIVE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ACTRESSES WERE COUNTED REMOVED FUNK THESE COMMUNITIES WITH MRC SUPPORT AND FUNDING. PARTICIPATION GREW IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNITS BY OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. THIS DATA WILL BE CRITICAL GOING FORWARD AS WE IDENTIFY WHERE DUMPING IS A PROBLEM. BASED ON THIS DATA WE CAN FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON UPSTREAM SOLUTIONS THAT PREVENT ILLEGAL DUMPING BEFORE IT OCCURS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A WORKING ILLEGAL DUMPING IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH FRESNO COUNTY IN A LOCAL SLEEP RETAILER TO PRODUCE A RADIO PSA TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL DUMPING. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY IN A SIMILAR PROJECT IN OF A PENDING CONTRACT WITH ALAMEDA BEAUTIFICATION COUNSEL TO COLLECT AND DOCUMENT. ILLEGALLY DUMPED UNITS IN THAT COMMUNITY. TURNING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMMERSEE WILL RELEASE ITS OWN PSA IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CITIES AND COUNTIES. TO CO BRAND OR CUSTOMIZE. WE CONTINUE TO PUBLICIZE THE INITIATIVE TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION GATHER DATA AND PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS THE ISSUE. FOURTH IS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOLID WASTE FACILITIES ARE NOT PARTICIPATING BECAUSE MRC IS NOT PAYING ENOUGH THIS IS FALSE. BEFORE WE LAUNCH THE PROGRAM MRC IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FACILITIES CURRENTLY ACCEPTING MATTRESSES IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER S. B. TWO FIFTY FOUR MRC PAYS THESE FACILITIES TO COLLECT MATTRESSES ON OUR BEHALF. TO INCENTIVIZE FACILITY PARTICIPATION AMMERSEE DEVELOPED A REASONABLE COMPENSATION MODEL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. BY WORKING WITH THE CAO RECYCLE MATTRESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL. ARE APPROACH TO COMPENSATION VERY SPOT VARIES. AND THE AMOUNT PAID IS BASED ON THE FACILITIES REAL COSTS. TODAY WE'VE ESTABLISHED REASONABLE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY OF THESE FACILITIES AND ARE WORKING TO ADD THE REMAINING SITES TO THE COLLECTION NETWORK. THOSE WHO COMPLAIN THAT ARE COMPENSATION METHOD IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ASKING FOR MORE THAN WHAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER FACILITIES. HAVE FOUND REASONABLE. TO DATE ONLY FIFTEEN LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAS STATED THAT THEY'RE NOT INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. MRCS ACT BEEN IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THESE ENTITIES. MEANWHILE WE ARE CONCURRENTLY WORKING WITH ALTERNATIVE COLLECTORS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. FIFTH WE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED REGARDING THE CONTRACT STATUS OF ONE OF OUR RECYCLING CONTRACTORS. AS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF MRC IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO HOLD ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS TO HIGH STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF SP TWO FIFTY FOUR. WHILE RUNNING A FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PROGRAM. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH RECYCLING PARTNERS ARE CLEARING WE EXPECT THEM TO BE HONORED. WHERE THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES WE WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS PERFORMANCE ISSUES? WERE HOPEFUL THAT THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED. FINALLY WE'VE BEEN ACCUSED PREMATURELY LOWERING THE PROGRAMS RECYCLING FEE THAT IS NOT THE CASE. S. B. TWO FIFTY FOUR REQUIRES MRC TO ESTABLISH A FUNDING LEVEL SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE PLANS BUDGET COSTS. AND OPERATE THE MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD ANY PRUDENT AND RIP UP FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. I'M ARE SEIZED. MANAGES ITS BUDGET IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF SP TWO FIFTY FOUR. AND THE TAXPAYERS WHO PAY THE POINT OF SALE FEE. OUR OPERATING BUDGET IS APPROVED BY CAL RECYCLING AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE EXTERNALLY AUDITED. THE PROGRAM HAS SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF RAMALLAH YEAR PERIOD WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING OUR SUFFICIENT RESERVES. WE MET OUR TWELVE MONTH TARGET MORE QUICKLY THAN EXPECTED AND SUBSEQUENTLY LOWERED ITS BE BY FIVE PERCENT TO RIGHT SIZE THE PROGRAM. OTHER CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS HAVE ENCOUNTERED SUBSTANTIAL CRITICISM FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FOR RUNNING. SUBSTANTIAL AND EXCESSIVE RESERVES MRC PROACTIVELY COUNTER THESE CRITICISMS BY PROVIDING A MODEST FEE REDUCTION AND CAL RECYCLE APPROVED THIS ACTION. AS A START UP ENTERPRISE. ACCOMPLISHED NEARLY ALL OF OUR STATED OBJECTIVES IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PROGRAM PLAN. WE MATTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN COLLECTION GOAL AND WE'RE ON PACE TO ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TARGET. OUR SUCCESS TO DATE IS NOT A CEILING. BUT A FLOOR UPON WHICH WE INCREASE OUR SERVICE LEVEL. PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS AND LONG TERM PLANS TO MEET AND EXCEED THE RECYCLING OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED IN TWO FIFTY FOUR. ANY SUGGESTION THAT AMOROUS YEARS REDUCING OUR SERVICE LEVEL COMMUNICATIONS EFFORT FOR LONG TERMS OBJECTIVES AS WITHOUT BASIS. MY COMPLETED CONCLUDING POINT IS THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM THAT GOVERNOR BROWN AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. CAN POINT TWO IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS COLLABORATION. AND MERCY AND IT'S BY BY MATTRESS PROGRAM SUPPORTS GREEN JOBS CLEANS UP COMMUNITIES AND SUPPORTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU. WELL YOU CITED FRESNO. FOUND. FIRST OF ALL A UP. I VOTED FOR THIS AB A BIT RELUCTANTLY. OUT WENT THROUGH IT. A SERIES OF THE TALK SHOWS IN FRESNO THAT. SAID IT'S A MATTRESS TAX. IF I RECALL THAT THE. INITIAL HEARINGS AND ALL. A. THESE MATTRESSES IN OUR. IT ALL OVER THE PLACE. I'M I'M I'M WILLING TO. SUPPORT AND GIVE THIS OPERATION A REAL A REAL CHANCE TO SUCCEED. NUMBER HAVING SAID THAT I HAVE A DOG IN TWO. A LOT OF THE REPORTING ALL OF THIS I HAVE TALKED TO OUR FOLKS BACK HOME. NOT NUMBER ONE. THIS IS REALLY WORKING. AND IT'S REALLY WORKING. WE ARE SEEING A REDUCTION AND THE. MATTRESSES THROWN AROUND. BACKYARDS I WE ARE SEEING. SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE USE OF IT. AND SO WHAT I. TO ME. THESE EVIDENCES ARE WHAT THIS. PROGRAM INITIALLY WANTED TO TRY TO ACHIEVE WHICH WAS A. THUG GOOD RECYCLING A GOOD REDUCTION. FAIRLY FAIRLY PRICED. COMMUNICATED WELL. OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB AND. AYE BUT FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY THERE AREAS TO IMPROVE YOUR NEW OBVIOUSLY THERE AT AT YOU KNOW THIRTY. MILLION DOLLAR RESERVE PER SURPLUS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. YOU HAVE FOR A START UP ISSUES AND MANAGEMENT DUH. BUT CHALLENGES LIKE IT LIKE EVERYBODY BUT I REALLY THINK IF YOU LOOK STEP BACK AND LOOK WHAT YOU SEE AS A. OKAY A OUT OF A REALLY GOOD START AND A WILLINGNESS TO RECOGNIZE THAT FEES DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO GO UP. AND MATT AS A FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY OTHER BUDGET COMMITTEE IN WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A FEE. THE CLIENT SLIGHTLY I THINK THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GOOD MANAGEMENT. AND I THINK A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS ARE. I JUST THINK UNNECESSARY AND AND REALLY DON'T GET TO THE TARGET FROM FROM OUR STANDPOINT AND. THE FRESNO REGION. WE APPRECIATE IT AND. I'M GLAD I VOTED FOR QUITE FRANKLY. I HAVE DONE AGAIN AND TAKE TAKE A LOOK AT. SOME OF THESE. RECYCLING RATES. AND. ON THE SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT WAS PASSED OUT HERE. IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE I. YOU GOT SIX. YOU GOT SIX RECYCLERS. IN TOTAL THAT RIGHT SIX ACROSS THE STATE. MOST OF THEM. ARE PRODUCING. CLOSE TO THAT THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT GOAL OF GETTING CLOSE TO MY RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT. I NOTICE ONE. OF THE SIX. I LOOKS TO BE DRAGGING DOWN THE REST WITH A WHAT I HAVE TO SUGGEST AS AN ABYSMAL PERFORMANCE. PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY. IS TO. ENGAGE RECYCLERS. HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO A PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. ARE AND IF NECESSARY CHANGE THEM OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT AT TO? FIX WHAT AMOUNTS TO. ONE OF THE SIX DRAWING EVERYBODY ELSE DOWN I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT READ FLANK HERE THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO ABOUT. OF FIXING THAT PROBLEM. WE BELIEVE THESE ARE FIXABLE PROBLEMS WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT PARTICULAR RECYCLING TO INCREASE THEIR RECYCLING. OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING THAT THAT AMMERSEE PUT TOGETHER WE DESIGNED THE ENTIRE PROGRAM AROUND TWO FIFTY FOUR THE OBJECTIVES. AND. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING COOPERATIVELY WE FELT WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN WITH CAL RECYCLE TO GET THIS PROGRAM OFF TO A FASTSTART. AGAIN OF FIVE DELINQUENT PERFORMERS THE PROGRAM. OUR OUR FIRST. GOAL IS TO GET MAKE THEM AND GET THEM TO BE COMPLIANT. TOP BUT WANT ONE FINAL. IT IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT DE THIS ONE OUT OF SIX. ISN'T JUST MISSING THE MARK SLIGHTLY. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DRAGGING THE REST OF THE WHOLE OPERATION. DOWN BUT. DO YOU HAVE ADEQUATE. I GUESS STATUTORY OR REGULATORY OR. MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY. TO GET THEM INTO A MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE OR FIND SOMEBODY ELSE DO THE JOB. WE DO WE DO THANKS. YOU KNOW THE. THE SECONDARY MARKETS FOR MATTRESS COMMODITIES FORTUNATE DON'T HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES THE BOTTLE BILL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. MY HIGHEST PERFORMING RECYCLERS EXCEEDED NINETY PERCENT RECOVERY RATE BY VOLUME OF THE MATERIALS THAT THEY HAVE. SUMMIT THESE HAD SPECIALLY MARKETS FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES WEBER IT MAY BE. BUT AGAIN OUR TARGET FOR OLIVER RECYCLERS HAS TO HIT THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MARK OKAY APPRECIATE THAT A LOT OF THE TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN. THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS BY THINK OFF TO GOOD START AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE'RE APPRECIATING IT MORE AND MORE. THAT MISTER THANK YOUR FINAL PRESENTATION WILL BE. HEIDI AND BORN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. WAS GOING TO SAY GOOD MORNING BUT HE EARNED GOOD AFTERNOON IF. WE ARE. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER. MY DECEMBER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL A PUBLIC BENEFIT NONPROFITS THAT EDUCATES AND ADVOCATES. FOR PRODUCERS TO BE THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO FUND DESIGN AND RECYCLE THEIR PRODUCT WASTE. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A MEMBER OF THE MATTRESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. CPSC HAS A FOURTEEN MEMBER BOARD OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBERS AND WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY WE FORMED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TO PROMOTE. POLICIES THAT MOVE AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND OPERATED PROGRAMS WHICH WERE NOT SUSTAINABLY FUNDED OR MEETING THE SOURCE REDUCTION GOALS OF AB NINE THIRTY NINE. FOR PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY POLICIES ARE WHITE USED WIDELY AROUND THE WORLD FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS INCLUDING PACKAGING. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON TOXIC AND PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS THAT THAT THAT DID NOT HAVE A MARKET VALUE. TO REDUCE WASTE WHICH IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OPTION. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PRODUCERS TO DESIGN PRODUCTS WITH RECYCLING IN MIND AND PROVIDE FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVES. THROUGH POLLUTER PAYS MODELS SUCH AS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY OR EPR. IS A BETTER WAY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF GREEN DESIGN AND ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF REDUCE AND RECYCLING. WE'VE BEEN THE STRONGEST EDUCATORS AND ADVOCATES FOR WELL THOUGHT OUT POLICIES TO MANAGE WASTE TO GET AWAY FROM PUBLICLY FINANCED THE MANAGE SYSTEMS. GROW GOVERNMENT AND CAN LACK RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGING MARKETS AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. THIS IS WHY. WE WERE CONCERNED WHEN THE MATTRESS LEGISLATION CONTINUE TO MOVE AND BE PASSED WITHOUT INCLUDING SOME OF OUR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS. AND FACT CBC WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND THE CITY OF CHULA VISTA WITH THE LAST OPPONENTS OF AB TWO FIVE SP TWO FIVE FOUR. AND SENT A LETTER IN AUGUST THE TWENTY THIRTEEN A COPY OF WHICH I PROVIDED. HIGHLIGHTING SPECIFIC CONCERNS AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO FIX THE BILL. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE FEE MONEY WAS HANDED OVER TWIN INDUSTRY GROUP WE BELIEVE WITHOUT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY OR RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THEY COULD USE THE MONEY. OUR LETTER LISTED FIVE KEY CONCERNS FIRST THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY HAVE NO REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD OF THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. TO THE NEED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SOLID WASTE FACILITIES FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM. THREE THE NEED FOR CLEARLY ARTICULATED RECYCLING GOALS TO BE SET BY CAO RECYCLE RETURN FORCIBLE AND NOT VAGUE. FOR TO SHORTEN A DEADLINES TO HOLD MRC ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE AND FIVE TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN THE DEFINITION OF MATTRESSES MATTRESS RETAILERS TO ENSURE THE FULL FUNDING OF THE PROGRAM. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE LETTER WE STATED WE WANT TO SUPPORT SB TWO FIVE FOUR AND HOPETHAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THESE AMENDMENTS IN THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH THEY ARE GIVEN. TO SIMPLY ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM WILL WORK WELL. AND THAT IS ALL WE WANT ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLY FUNDED. OPERATED AND BY THE APPROPRIATE PARTIES AND THAT WORK AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR HOW WELL IT'S WORKING AND FRESNO I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR EVERY COUNTY. IN CALIFORNIA BUT I'M REALLY GLAD AND IT IS WORKING AND SOME COMPANIES. WHY MERCY HAS HAD THE SMOOTHEST ROLL OUT OF ANY OF THE PROGRAMS? THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS NOT WHERE IT SHOULD BE FOR A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. SOME OF THE REASONS OUTLINED IN THE LETTER OF THE BECAUSE OF THESE CURRENT PROBLEMS SUCH AS NOT HAVING. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY ON THE BOARD OF THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM SO THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE BE ABLE TO WORK WITH A BETTER. HOWEVER THE BEST WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR US TO HAVE NEVER GIVEN PUBLIC FEE MONEY TO A BOARD THAT IS ESSENTIALLY. THE SAME BOARD AS IT IS BY THE INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. WHO QUOTE FROM THEIR WEBSITE WORKS HARD EVERY DAY ON BEHALF OF US BUT MEMBERS TO CREATE A STRONGER MATTRESS INDUSTRY? AND THIS IS THE SAME POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST WE HAVE IN THE CORPORATE PROGRAM WHERE THE CARPET AND RUG INSTITUTE MEMBERS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME BOARD ON THE CARE BOARD. THE LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY THIRTEEN ON P. CARPET AND MATTRESSES. A HYBRID POLICY APPROACH IS WHAT IT IS MEANING THAT THE TO REDUCE PRODUCER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL'S. ALL OF THEM ELIMINATED THE PRODUCER PAY PORTION. INSTEAD TOOK CONSUMER FEES. AND GAVE IT TO A PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITY. WITHOUT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY OR OVERSIGHT OUR OPINION. FOLLOW THE MONEY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SAYINGS BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS A LOT. IN THIS CASE HANDING PUBLIC FEE MONEY TO OTHER STATE INDUSTRY GROUPS WITHOUT ENOUGH CONTROLS RISKY. WE FOUND THAT OUT THE HARD WAY WHEN PINK HERE USE THE FEE MONEY TO SUE CAO RECYCLE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE REGULATIONS FOR OVERSIGHT. AND NOT ONLY PAID FOR THE LAWSUIT BUT PAID FOR THE APPEAL AND PAID FOR BOTH SIDES INCLUDING COVER CYCLES PORTION. WE BELIEVE THAT STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BASED OUT OF STATE AND USE CALIFORNIA MONEY. WHICH IS NOT THEIRS HAVE THE PRIMARY GOAL TO KEEP THE FEE LOW ON THEIR PRODUCTS. NOT NECESSARILY MAXIMIZING SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING OR THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AS EVIDENCE OF THIS MRC REDUCED THE FEE AS THEY EXPLAINED LAST YEAR FIFTY CENTS FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS TO ATTEND FIFTY A UNIT. WITH UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION FROM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE CREW I ADVISORY COMMITTEE RESPECT BY CAO RECYCLES DIRECTOR AND REPRESENTS ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS OF THE STATE NOT ONE OF US SUGGESTED THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN. SO HOW DID IT HAPPEN. BECAUSE THE BILL WAS WRITTEN SO THE BUDGET COULD BE APPROVED SEPARATELY FROM THE STEWARDSHIP PLAN. AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE NO POWER. IF THE MONEY WAS BEING SPENT TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM WAS WORKING WELL FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE RESERVE WOULDN'T BE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TWO YEARS INTO THE PROGRAM THERE IS A LOT TO DO AND WE COULD HAVE SPENT THAT MONEY ON MAKING SURE ALL THE COUNTIES ARE GETTING THE SAME SERVICE AT PRESENT WAS GETTING. I POSE A QUESTION TO OUR SUPPORTERS. ASKING FOR STORIES OF WHAT WAS OR WASN'T WORKING WITH THE PROGRAM. ONE RESPONSES FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHO WAS SO UPSET AT STILL SILLY SEEN MATTRESSES ON THE STREETS HE WANTS TO FIX THE LEGISLATION. AND OTHER RESPONSES FROM THE CITY OF DAVIS AND WE SHARED WITH YOU THE PICTURES. OF SO YOU HAVE THAT HANDOUT. OF THE MATTRESSES THE PILOT EVERY AUGUST WHICH IS NORMAL FOR MOST UNIVERSITY TOWNS. IT MRC SUSPENDED THEIR LARGE VOLUME PROGRAM AN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH SERVICE THE UNIVERSITIES THE RETAILERS AND THE HOTELS. SO I MERCY STILL HAS NO PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH UC DAVIS ANY COLLEGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT PROGRAMS REINSTATED. SO ALL THE MATTRESSES IN THOSE PICTURES THAT GO TO LANDFILL. THEIR MANY MORE STORIES AND SOME WILL TESTIFY TODAY SUCH AS DOWN OR COUNTY. BUT IN SHORT THE PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY NOT PROVIDING EACH FEE PAYER. WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW. ACCESS TO RECYCLING NOR PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH RELIEF FROM THE COSTS IN THE BLADE FROM ILLEGAL DUMPING THAT THEY WERE PROMISED. WHAT WE SUPPORTED PAINT BECAUSE THAT INDUSTRY AND WORK FOR TEN YEARS WITH MULTIPLE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DESIGN A MODEL BILL? IT WAS A REALLY GOOD START AND IT STILL WORKS WE THINK THE BEST OF ALL THE PROGRAMS TO DATE. THE CARPET A MATTRESS BILLS WERE MOVING FURTHER AWAY FROM THE POLICY MODEL WE KNEW WOULD WORK. THEY'RE STILL AND WE ARE STILL UNCLEAR IN FACT HOW CALIFORNIA WOULD GET OUR FEE MONEY BACK FROM ANY STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION OF CAO RECYCLE DISAPPROVED THE PLAN. AND AND THERE WAS CHANGE OF AN ORGANIZATION RUNNING THE PROGRAMS. THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT THAT WOULD KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT WORRYING IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BAC IF WE NEEDED TO CHANGE OWNERSHIP OF THAT PROGRAM. WHY WE APPRECIATE WHATEVER SCENE HAS DONE AND WE DEFINITELY DO AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM IN FACT EVERY TIME I GO TO COMPLAIN OR SOMETHING I SHARE IT WITH THEM SO THEY GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT? WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. FOR US AND PRODUCING THE FEE AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ENTIRE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHEN THE PROGRAM IS NOT FULLY ROLLED OUT. NOR WORKING WELL IN SOME CASES TO US WAS JUST UNACCEPTABLE. HERE'S MS KEY SUGGESTIONS FOR MRC TO IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE. ONE HIRE MORE STAFF AND GET EVERY COUNTY THE SERVICE THEY PAY FOR WE STILL HAVE A COUNTIES WITHOUT SERVICE. TO REINSTATE THE LARGE VOLUME PROGRAM AND FUND SERIOUS ADDITIONAL EFFORTS ON MARKET DEVELOPMENT WE CAN'T PULL THINGS OUT OF THE WAY STREAM IF WE HAVE NO MARKET FOR THEM. THREE ENCOURAGE RECYCLERS TO FORWARD REBUILDABLE MATTRESSES. TO ONE OF THE MANY MATCHES RENOVATORS IN THE STATE FOR HIGHEST AND BEST USE THAT WAS A PROMISE OF THE BILL THAT WE WOULD NOT HURT THE RENOVATORS AND I'M HEARING FROM THE RENOVATORS. THEY ARE BEING HURT BY THIS PROGRAM AND MATCHES IS THE COULD OF BEEN RENOVATED ARE BEING RECYCLED INSTEAD. FOR PROMOTE MUCH MORE HEAVILY THE RETAIL TAKE BACK PROGRAM BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE MOST CONVENIENT IF MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT IT THEY WOULD ASK FOR IF THE RETAILER AND PROVIDED. FIVE IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE CAP OF ONLY ALLOWING FIVE MATTRESSES BE COLLECTED AND BROUGHT TO RECYCLERS PER DAY WHICH IS FORCING COLLECTORS LITERALLY TO DRIVE ACROSS TOWN BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY DROPPED FIVE YEAR AND THEY HAVE TO DROP FIVE YEAR AND THEN FIGHT HERE. AND SIX IS TO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THREE DOLLARS PER MATTRESS RECYCLE TO A HIGHER NUMBER. THREE DOLLARS REALLY IS ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE TO COLLECT AND RECYCLE MATTRESSES. WE ARE REASONABLE BUT WE HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR GOOD REASON. WE JUST WANT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR EVERYBODY. WE STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF HIS POLICIES IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND ARE ARE AVAILABLE TO SHARE THESE INSIGHTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIX EXIST EXISTING PROGRAMS. AS OUR AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION THE NATIONAL STORAGE OF ACTION COUNCIL DID LAST YEAR WITH CARPET AND AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS LEGISLATURE. WE HOPE WITH YOUR HELP TO PASS NEW LAWS. WITH HIGHER STANDARDS TO ENSURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL WORK. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ARE A MYTH AND WARNED THAT A STAFF COMMENTS THAT REFER TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT THAT IS UNDER WAY AND. I'M KIND OF RECOMMENDATION. IS TO ALLOW THAT OUGHT TO PROCEED AND THEN. SEE WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND THAT. PRESUMABLY ACTED. ODD YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT. YES I THINK IT'S A GREAT THING TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT GOOD OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROGRAMS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW OUR PUBLIC MONEY IS IS BEING GIVEN TO GROUPS THAT. RIGHT NOW IN THIS LAW THEY COULD PHARMACY SIX AND MOVE IT FROM C. THREE WHICH IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION TO A C. SIX WHICH IS A MEMBERSHIP BENEFIT ONLY ORGANIZATION. VERY DIFFERENT UNDER IRS RULE MEANING THEY COULD SEE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THEIR MEMBERS IS REALLY NOT TO HAVE THE PROGRAM WORK THEY DON'T LIKE IT. AND THEY COULD SABOTAGE IT LEGALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT THESE ARE LITTLE FIXES THAT WE'VE LEARNED. THAT WE HAVE DONE A WHOLE WHITE PAPER AND HAD AN EXPERT ATTORNEY DO A WHITE PAPER ON THAT VERY THING. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE LOCAL ORDINANCES AS WELL WHERE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAD FORMED A SISSY SIX AND THEY'RE DELAYING WE THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACT FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. SO THERE'S LOTS OF LITTLE NUANCES THAT NEED TO PROBABLY BE TWEAKED WE LEARNED THIS OVER TIME I MEAN THIS IS AND AS YOU SAID IT'S A GREAT START. BUT WE'VE GOT IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE AND WE DO HAVE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE GETTING THE SERVICE THEY'RE PAYING FOR WE JUST WANTED TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY. HE SAID THERE ARE EIGHT TO. ONE MOMENT MISTER PATTERSON NOW THERE'S A COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY HAVE. A NO PROGRAM AT ALL ACCORDING TO MRC. LAST PRESENTATION WE HAVE THE POWER POINT YES. ARE ARE THOSE SAID A RURAL COUNTIES TO OUR RURAL IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS TO SIX ARE NOT. RIGHT. TO. I DON'T OF THE LIST OKAY YEAH WELL MAYBE AN ARTICLE. SURE THAT. I KNOW DEL NORTE COUNTY IS ONE COUNTY THAT'S REALLY ON HOW YOU GET THERE YEAH THE UP. PATTERSON YEAH THANK YOU MISTER OF. I WAS A BIT OF A. SOMEWHAT STARTLING CHARGE. THAT THEY WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE YOU HAVE OUTLINED COULD I HAVE THE MRC PEOPLE UP PLEASE. WITH RESPECT TO CHANGING THEIR ORGANIZATION. IT IT. YEAH I'M NOT I'M NOT ACCUSING THEM OF NO I I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A PUT IT. THE WAY THE LAW WAS I UNDERSTAND I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. ARE YOU INTERESTED OR DO YOU INTEND TO TAKE THE ACTION THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. CHANGE THE THE IRS STATE THE IRIS. FROM THAT SEAT THREE TO A SEAT SIX YEAH. NOW WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF INDUSTRY FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED CALIFORNIA'S NOT THE ONLY STATE. WITH A MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM WE ALSO THAT'S UP THAT'S OFF THE TABLE. ABSOLUTELY OKAY. APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU OF MISTER MEMBER. SURE OF THANK YOU ADJUST TO THINGS REAL QUICK. MISS SANBORN REFERENCED SP TWO FIFTY FOUR NUMBER OF TIMES. I'D LIKE TO ROAM ALL REMIND EVERYBODY HERE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ALL THERE'S THIS AND RESPONSE YES PATTERSON'S QUESTION. OR YOU MAKING A SEPARATE POINT I WAS MAKING A SEPARATE POINT. THE ARE JUST NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT YOU CAN RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. FORGET AND IF YOU ARE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT I'M NOT GO LET YOU DO BOTH SIT AT THE TABLE AND MAY I MAKE MY DO NOT MATCH OF THE LATTER. YEAH MECHANISM PRECLUDE YOU FROM PUBLIC I'M AND THIS CHAIR NOT I DON'T WANT TO. UNNECESSARILY LIKE THAT ALL OF THIS WE WERE TO. JUST AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AN EXPLANATION OF THAT BILL. IN A LANGUAGE THAT YOU WOULD PUT IT IN WRITING AND GET IT TO THE MEMBERS. I WILL LOOK AT IT FOR SURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD IT WILL PROCEED TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW AND TO. BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIKE TO SPEAK. PLEASE STEP FORWARD. HELLO MY US MO EXCITER ENTRY ON BEHALF OF DEL MAR COUNTY. ASTHMA MENTIONED. WHERE RURAL COUNTY WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST TIPPING FEES IN THE STATE AM AND ILLEGAL DUMPING IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTY? WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MRC BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AT LEAST ONE FREE DAILY DROP OFF LOCATION AND EVERY COUNTY. AND IF NOT WOULD LIKE THE REVENUE COLLECTED FROM DELMARK COUNTIES RESIDENTS TO BE REMITTED TO THE COUNTY AND FOR THE ONES PROVIDING THAT DAILY JOB AT THAT DALY COLLECTION AND DROP OFFERED OPPORTUNITY. AND WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THEM MARCY'S EFFORTS PROVIDE COLLECTION EVENTS IN OUR COUNTY AND. BUT WE WOULD REITERATE THAT THE SPORADIC EVENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM REMAINS SO WE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPROVING THE STATE'S RECYCLING PROGRAM AND. AND LET OF THE FORTHCOMING AUDIT AND OTHER EFFORTS THINK IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER PATTERSON ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR LETTING THE HEARING GO YOU'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO GET THE VIEWS EXPRESSED WE PERCEIVE THAT. I JUST WANTED TO REMIND FOLKS OVER HERE IN THE AUDIENCE OVER HERE FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN S. B. TWO FIFTY FOUR PASS. I KNOW BOTH OF YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WERE HERE AND ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THE BILL. THAT WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE BILL. WE HAD EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY DEMOCRAT CAUCUS AND THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS WELL FOR THE BILL. AND IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE HAD OVER HALF OF THE REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR. AND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL ATTACKED IT AS A QUOTE TAX INCREASE IN THOSE RECYCLING FEE. THE REASON WHY MENTIONING THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS VERY BROAD SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE. AND THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AND THEY'VE ALREADY DIVERTED TO MILLION MATTRESSES FROM LANDFILLS SO IT REALLY IS WORKING TO MISTER PATTERSON'S POINT. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE CONCERNED AND THIS PROGRAM IS NOT PERFECT. AND THE. BYE BYE MATCHES PROGRAM WILL ONLY GET BETTER BUT IT'S CLEARLY MET THE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE SPOKEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS ON YOUR FLOOR WHEN YOU VOTED FOR IT SIR. AND WHEN TWO THIRDS PLUS OF YOUR COLLEAGUES DEAD. AND UP WORK YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. AND WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION ONE THING I'M ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO UNANIMOUS VOTE BY THE MATTRESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE SAYING. DON'T LOWER THE FEE. THEY WERE DARNED IF THEY DO AND DARNED IF THEY DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T LOWER BY FIFTY CENTS. AND YOU HAVE A HIGH RESERVE BECAUSE IT'S A NEW PROGRAM THAT STILL ROLLING OUT THAN THEY WOULD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THE HIGH RESERVE LIKE OTHER PROGRAMS OUT. SO IT'S A BALANCING ACT THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS TAX MONEY THEY'RE DOING THE BEST JOB THEY CAN'T MANAGE EFFICIENTLY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUING SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THERESA BURGER BACHELOR. SORRY. I AM FROM EAGLE CONSOLES ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE OR THE ALAMEDA. TWENTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY I JUST WANNA QUICKLY SAY THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE AUDIT THAT WAS PUT FORTH BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU. WAS BEEN THE LIMON DATING DISCUSSION THERE AND IT IS A NEW PROGRAM THERE. I THINK IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY EVERYONE. A SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THE PURPOSE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AND THERE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT I THINK. A WE WILL ALSO OF FOLLOW THE. BUT WHAT WILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT. WELL CONSIDERING THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF MR PATERSON QUICKLY WON THE AYE AYE SPORT THE AUDITOR'S WELL A HAVING A. HUGE TRUST IN OUR WATER INDEPENDENT. I WOULD ALSO JUST SUGGEST.
