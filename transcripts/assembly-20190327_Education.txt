THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE BY PROVIDING ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS ACCESS TO REQUIRED COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM. CERTAINLY. STUDENTS IN GRADE THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH AND THEN ELEVENTH ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT TESTS THAT AGAIN IS THE STATEWIDE REQUIRED TEST. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADMINISTER AN ENTRANCE EXAM SUCH AS THE ACT. SAT INSTEAD OF THE STATE REQUIRED -- REQUIREMENTS TO THE STATE REQUIRED ASSESSMENT FOR ELEVENTH GRADE. THE ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT WILL BE OFFERED DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AT NO COST TO STUDENTS. IT BUILDS IT INTO THE SCHOOL THAT BUILDS IN AS PART OF THE SCHOOL CULTURE BUILDS IN A CULTURE OF COLLEGE GOING. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE ASSESSMENT TO BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE STANDARDS MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE THAT A COMMA ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PROVIDED. OUR FROM OUR PROVIDED A STUDENT'S I EP OR MAYBE. FIVE OH FOR NEARLY FORTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING OAKLAND SAN JOSE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND LONG BEACH AND MANY OTHERS AGAIN. ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING THE SAT OR THE ACT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE. THE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATE. THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND PARENTS. AND ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TESTING I GIVE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS MORE TIME FOR INSTRUCTION. STUDENTS TAKE THE SAT OR ACT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT IS MEANINGFUL TO THEM. THE SAT IS MORE USEFUL TO TEACHERS. THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT THAT'S THE ASPECT IS A TEST. THE SAT IS AN ASSESSMENT THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT WHAT IS A TEST WILL ATTEST IS TYPICALLY A SUMMATIVE EVENT THAT YOU GIVE AT THE END OF THE YEAR OR THE END OF THE END OF A UNIT. AND THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW THE STUDENT DID AT THE END OF THE UNIT BUT ASSESSMENTS TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN. WITH THE S. C. TEAR THE ACTU GIVEN THE EIGHTH NINTH TENTH AND ULTIMATELY THE FINAL TEST ON THE ELEVENTH AND WHAT YOU DO IN THOSE INTRAMUROS. IS YOU SEEK TO ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT YOU FIND -- AS YOU TEST ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT'S A CLASSROOM TEACHER ME I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE MOVED TO MORE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT JUST A TESTING SYSTEM. THE ASPECT IS A TESTING SYSTEM NOT AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS AGAIN TELL YOU HOW STUDENTS ARE DOING ALONG THE WAY SO YOU A MONITOR AND A DRESSER PROGRESS. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OR THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN STATES THAT USE THE S. BACK FOR THE ELEVENTH GRADE ASSESSMENT WELL TWENTY FIVE STATES TO THE SAT. OR THE ACT. THE CURRENT SCANDAL MAKES THE CASE FOR S. B. I'M SORRY THE CURRENT SCANDAL MAKES THE CASE FOR AB. FIFTY ONE BY ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TEST PREPARATION. AND THE TEST IS ADMINISTERED IN A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT WITH PROTOCOLS PROFESSIONALS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE DOCTOR RUTH PRECIOUS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PARAMOUNT. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SHE WILL NOW TESTIFIED. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST STATED MY NAME IS DOCTOR RUTH FOR US ON THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PARAMOUNT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT -- AND TODAY WAS SAT DAY -- IN PARAMOUNT THIS IS OUR THIRD ANNUAL YEAR WHERE BECAUSE OF OUR CONCENTRATION FUNDS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH FREE ACCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE SAT. WE ARE A DISTRICT WHERE 94% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ARE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED 35% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS EVERY OPPORTUNITY DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TOOLS THAT WILL HELP THEM IN OUR ENDEAVORS TO PROVIDE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO TODAY ALL OF OUR ELEVENTH GRADERS TOOK THE SAT WITH THE TEACHER THAT IS IS AT THAT KNOWS THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SUPPORTIVE WE ALSO OFFER THE PSA T. THIRTY YEAR DOING THAT SINCE EIGHTH GRADE. WE OFFER KAPLAN SERVICES -- FOR OUR STUDENTS PREPARING THEM FOR THE EXAM AS WELL AS FREE -- AP EXAMS AT FOUR FOR OUR STUDENTS OUT WE DO THIS BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE AND BECAUSE WE WANT OUR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE TOOLS -- OTHERWISE IN OUR DISTRICT NOT ALL STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT -- BUT TODAY A 100% OF ALL OUR STUDENTS HAD AND WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE TO OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES BY PROVIDING THIS THAT. YOU KNOW SEIZE UP WHETHER YOU CAN THAT COLLEGE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS ATTAINABLE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WHO ALSO COSPONSORED THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT -- ALL OF OUR ON BEHALF OF US WE ARE ALL IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FIFTY ONE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE STATE. ARE SUPPORTED BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES THE COLLEGE DIPLOMA GAP BY OPENING DOORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS THROUGH OFFERING THESE TESTS DURING THE DAY AND THAT NO COST TO STUDENTS. IF MORE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO TAKE A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TEST MORE UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS CAN BE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO SCHOLARSHIPS. FREE PERSONALIZED TEST PRACTICE TOOLS AND COLLEGE APPLICATION FEE WAIVERS REMOVING THEIR HISTORIC BARRIER STOP TO COLLEGE EDUCATION. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD TRULY HELP TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST FOR PARAMOUNT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT FOR FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE REALITY THAT WE'RE LIVING IN NOW IS THE FACT THAT THE SAT IS A USE FOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS FOR ENTRANCE INTO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL ALSO ENSURES THAT STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS ARE APPROPRIATELY ACCOMMODATED EQUALLY IMPORTANT THE BILL REQUIRES ENGLISH LEARNERS TO BE PROVIDED. APPROPRIATE ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDING ACCESS TO TESTING INSTRUCTIONS AND THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE THAT'S 35% OF OUR POPULATION AND CONSISTENT WITH ONE OF THE PRIMARY TENANTS OF LOCAL CONTROL. THE BILL OFFERS THE CHOICE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DISCUSS THIS AT THE GOVERNING BOARD LEVEL AND DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THEIR STUDENTS -- PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS INSURANCE THIS CONVERSATION THIS BILL INSURANCE A CONVERSATION HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THE VALUE OF THIS CHOICE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH NOW GIVE STATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP ADDRESS THE DIPLOMA GAP. GIVING ALL STUDENTS EASIER ACCESS TO COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TEST. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE WITH YOU FOR THIS REASON WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE ACT. THANK YOU KNOW MEGAN KERR FROM THE LONG BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SHE IS A BOARD MEMBER. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS MEGAN KERR I'M ON THE BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR THE LONG BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A MEMBER OF CSPA WHICH IS CO SPONSORING THIS BILL. AND THE CURRENT MOM OF THREE COLLEGE KIDS -- FOR US IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED THIS IS A JUSTICE ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY AND ACCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS. TWO THIRDS OF OUR FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD. SCHOOL MEALS A FREE ESSAY T. OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED THEMSELVES TO BE COLLEGE MATERIAL. TODAY IS ALSO SAT DAY IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED SO FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED JUNIORS ARE TAKING THE TEST IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED TODAY. OUT IN A SUPPORTIVE SETTING IN A SAFE SETTING I SAW ON TWITTER YESTERDAY THEY EVEN TEACHERS LEAVING POSTED NOTES ON KIDS DESK THINKER AGING THEM THAT THEY'VE GOT THIS IN THIS IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING SUPPORTED. AND THAT'S CRITICAL AS THEY WALK INTO A ROOM AND THEY'RE NERVOUS -- THE NERVOUS IS IS DECREASE FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE OFFER THE PS EIGHTY STARTING IN EIGHTH GRADE EIGHTH GRADE NINTH GRADE AND TENTH GRADE WHICH ALLOWS US TO DO THAT ASSESSMENT WORK THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS SPEAKING OF SO CRITICALLY IT ISN'T I'M A POINT IN TIME TEST. IT'S REALLY WORKING WITH STUDENTS TO MOVE THOSE SKILLS AS THEY GO THROUGH THE YEARS. DURING THE TIME LIMIT UNIFIED HAS OFFERED THE SAT FOR FREE WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS MEETING THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CSU SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME OUR GRADUATION RATE HAS INCREASED FOR THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW. MORE OF OUR STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING A THREE G. COURSEWORK REQUIRED FOR ADMISSION TO BOTH THE CSU AND YOU SEE SYSTEMS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A BIG INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PASSING ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMS FOR COLLEGE CREDIT. AS A SUPPORT WE OFFER FREE SAT PREPARATION PEER TUTORING AND MULTIPLE SITE LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THEIR SAT PREP. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE KHAN ACADEMY ALLOWS STARTING IN EIGHTH GRADE WITH VERY SPECIALIZED INDIVIDUALIZED -- SUPPORT. FOR AREAS OF WEAKNESS SO WHEN MY DAUGHTER TOOK THE PSA T.. SHE FOUND THE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT SHE NEEDED TO WORK ON TO IMPROVE FOR THE NEXT TIME AND REALIZE SHE WAS REALLY STRONG IN SOME AREAS AND DIDN'T NEED TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME DOING PREP WORK -- SO IT'S NOT A BLANKET SUPPORT INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT. FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DO THEIR BEST WORK. I THINK WE OWE OUR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY OUR STUDENTS OF UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS THESE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO PREPARE FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE AND IN COLLEGE WE KNOW THAT FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THEY DON'T CONSIDER. COLLEGE SOMETIME IS AN OPTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHETHER IT'S APPLICATION FEES TUITION -- ARE A BURDEN ON THEIR FAMILY SO WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE WORKING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES SO BY GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THIS TEST DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY AS PART OF THEIR SCHOOL CULTURE. IT OPENS THEM UP TO FEED THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE VERY SAT SPECIFIC -- WE KNOW THAT GIVING KIDS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY WILL MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND WE SUPPORT THEM IN BEING ABLE TO MEET THEM. THIS IS AGAIN ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING FOR ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT IT ALLOWS THE CONVERSATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR GOVERNING BOARDS ALONG WITH THEIR SUPERINTENDENTS IN THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. TO DECIDE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM WE KNOW IN LONG BEACH FOR THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS THIS IS WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF TESTS THAT ARE JUNIORS TAKING A JUNIOR YEAR IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HERE BUT ALSO A VERY BUSY YEAR. TAKING OUT FOUR DAYS OF TESTING. IS A GOOD THING FOR THEM THEY'RE READY TO TAKE THE SAT THEY KNOW THE IMPLICATIONS IT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM AND THEY COME PREPARED THAT DAY. TO DO THE ASPECT HAS AFTER THAT. FOR SOME FOLKS AND AFTER ANY P. TEST HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN -- LET'S JUST SAY THE FOCUS IS AND ALWAYS THERE UNLESS IT'S HIGHLY INCENTIVIZE BY THINGS LIKE PROM TICKETS IN YOUR BOOKS. SO THIS IS AN OPTION FOR DISTRICTS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THEIR VERY INDIVIDUALIZED SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH OVER A THOUSAND IN THE STATE WE THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE. BUT WE KNOW FIRST HAND OUR KIDS WILL DO AMAZING THINGS AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN THIS BILL DOES THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I NEXT WE HAVE BILLY DEE WHICH IS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SHE IS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT FROM NEARBY KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILLY DEE SCOTT AND I AM A LIMIT GREATER I JOHN F. KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO. I SUPPORT AB SEVEN FIVE ONE BECAUSE EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE SAT OR ACT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE. HELPING STUDENTS CONNECT TO THE TEST IN FINANCIAL AID IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU WANT MORE STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE AND BECOME SUCCESSFUL. I KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL WE HAVE AS A TEACHER. SO ALL STUDENTS TAKE THE SAT DURING THE SCHOOL HOURS. AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE THIS AS A T. IN SCHOOL HELPED ME VERY MUCH. AND COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS ARE STRESSFUL ENOUGH AS IT IS SINCE I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE SAT I'M MY OWN SCHOOL DURING THE SCHOOL DAY I WAS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. I IN COLLEGE I AM PLANNING ON STUDYING MARKETING AND BUSINESS AND HOPES OF ONE DAY BECOMING AN ENTREPRENEUR.

SHANNON PRIMER EDUCATIONAL PARALEGAL AND TEACHERS WIFE WE'RE IN SUPPORT. OKAY THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO TESTIFY. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE DO WE HAVE ANY UP I BEG YOUR PARDON OKAY GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BRIAN REAVIS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST APOLOGIZE WE DIDN'T GET OUR LETTER INTENDED TO MAKE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- WE RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS AN EFFORT TO BOOST COLLEGE GOING PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS THAT WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. BUT FRANKLY WE WE STUDIED THIS OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR. WE AGONIZE OVER THE TRADE OFFS AND THIS YEAR WE CAME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AND THAT IS WE THINK THE TRADE OFFS IN THE COMPROMISE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE BY ADOPTING THIS BILL. IS TOO GREAT OF A PRICE TO PAY. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS -- ARE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM RELIES ON THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD. TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS BASED ON COMPARING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ACROSS SUB GROUPS AND ACROSS DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES. WHEN WE IDENTIFY A PROBLEM WE HOPE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS BY DIRECTING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS THROUGH THE SYSTEM SUPPORTS? WE THINK THAT THIS APPROACH ALTHOUGH WE APPLIED FREE AS A T. FOR ALL. WE THINK THIS APPROACH UNDERMINES THE SORT OF THEORY OF ACTION OF OUR SCHOOL DASHBOARD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE AS CLEARLY. AS PRECISELY. HOW STUDENTS ARE DOING BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM RELIES ON COMPARING THEM TO ONE ANOTHER? SO WE HAVE STUDENTS TAKING SEPARATE TESTS. THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PUT INTO PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES TO SOME KIND OF ALGORITHM OR CONVERSION. AND EACH STEP THAT YOU TAKE TO MAKE THAT CONVERSION IS GOING TO INTRODUCE. STATISTICAL ERROR VARIANCE IN IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE CLARITY IN THE PRECISION OF THOSE COMPARISONS. SO OVERALL MY MAIN REASON FOR THE MAIN REASON WE'RE OPPOSED IS THAT WE THINK THE TRADE OFF HERE IS. SOME STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE SAT FOR FREE. BUT THE STATE IS GOING TO BE LESS ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS ARE SERVING THEM AND PREPARING THOSE STUDENTS TO GAIN ADMISSION TO UNIVERSITY. AND GO ON TO GRADUATE WE THINK THAT THAT PRICE IS TOO HIGH TO PAY. SECONDLY. WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT ACCOMMODATIONS FOR TWO SUBGROUPS IN PARTICULAR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL WITH DISABILITIES. LAST YEAR THE STATE ADVISORY COMMISSION ON STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LOOKED AT THIS BILL. THE THE PREVIOUS VERSION OPPOSED IT AND CONCLUDED THAT STUDENTS TO TAKE THE SAT OR STUDENTS WHO TAKE. YES THE SAT FROM THOSE GROUPS WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED RELATIVE TO STUDENTS WHO TAKE THE S. BACK SO THAT MEANS FOR THOSE GROUPS WOULD BE EVEN LESS ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR US AND WE DON'T WANT TO RELY ON THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE AN INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS ON WHETHER OR NOT. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S ENGLISH LONGER ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE ADEQUATE. LASTLY I THINK WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT NOW IS THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SAT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS AN INVESTIGATION GOING ON OF THE CURRENT SCANDAL. THE ACADEMIC SENATE IS REVIEWING WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE USE OF THE SAT IN UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS. UC REGENT AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR YOU LLOYD OAKLEY IS CALLING FOR ELIMINATION OF THE USE OF THE S. A. T.. AND IN MISSIONS. WE THINK RIGHT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE USE OF THE S. A. T.. IN ADMISSIONS IN FACT WE THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO PRESS THE PAUSE BUTTON. AND ASK OURSELVES WHAT'S THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF THE S. A. T. ON STUDENTS WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING HIGHER EDUCATION. AND ARE WE DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO REDUCE BIAS AND SAFEGUARD AGAINST FRAUD. EVERY DAY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE -- UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED THANK YOU. IF I MAY OKAY WHAT TIME SIR GIVE OWN MEN WOMEN MORE OUTSIDE OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. XENA. JUST TO GIVE THE OPPOSITION IS NEW SO THIS IS NEW TO ME THIS IS NEW INFORMATION TODAY FOR ME -- THE RESULTS OF THE S. EIGHTY WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE DASHBOARD JUST AS THE RESULTS OF THE ASPECTS ARE NOW -- IN THE BILL REQUIRES THE ASSESSMENT TO BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE STANDARDS. MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE THAT ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HE SPOKE OF WAS LAST YEAR. NOT TO THIS YEAR'S BILL SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT BUT BUT AGAIN IF I GROUPS THAT OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR -- THAT THAT THEY ARE NOT HERE TODAY THEY'RE NOT OPPOSING TODAY THAT -- THIS BILL THEY ARE THEY'RE NEUTRAL AS FAR AS I KNOW. AND WITH REGARD TO SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IT REQUIRES US TO ACCOMMODATE SPECIAL STUDENTS IS EVEN BETTER. BECAUSE WE SCHOOL SITE PERSONNEL -- THAT WOULD BE -- INSURING THAT THE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE FULFILLED AT THE SCHOOL SITE. AND GIVING THE TEST AT THE SCHOOL SITE IS A SAFER MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT THEN THEN THEN THEN I'VE BEEN OF SOME PLACE OFF CAMPUS AND AND CONDUCTED BY A THIRD PARTY QUITE FRANKLY. SO GIVEN THE CURRENT SCANDAL -- I MEAN YOU CAN BLAME SAT YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE SAT BUT TO ME BLAMING US EIGHTY FOR PEOPLE CHEATING ON IT'S KIND OF LIKE BLAMING THE BANK FOR GETTING ROBBED. RIGHT -- IN AGAIN I I THINK. THE CURRENT SITUATION MAKES THE CASE FOR EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE ONE BY ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TEST PREPARATION. ONE INTO THE TEST IS GIVEN ON SITE IN A VERY SECURE. AND PROTOCOL ORIENTED FASHION AND I KNOW MISS KERR HAD -- THINK DID YOU WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING. WITH ME HE IS INTERESTED -- WE DO HAVE RESEARCH TALKING ABOUT THE CORRELATION RIGHT BETWEEN THE SAT AND THE S. BACK -- AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THEY ARE BROADLY ASSESSING THE SAME SKILLS THERE'S A ZERO POINT SEVEN SEVEN WHICH IS A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ASPECT YOU NEED RW. AN ASPECT YOU AWAY AND ZERO POINT EIGHT TWO WHICH IS A VERY STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SAT MATH AND S. BACK MATH. BOTH TESTS INDICATE A COMPARABLE PERCENTAGE OF ALL STUDENTS MEETING THE STANDARDS IN THE LA WHILE FIFTY THREE MET SAT AND MATH. WHILE 31% MATT S.. EIGHTY AND JUST ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PIECE THERE'S ESSENTIALLY A ONE TO ONE MATCH WHERE APPLICABLE BETWEEN THE FORTY TWO UNIVERSAL TOOLS. DESIGNATED SUPPORTS AND ACCOMMODATION WITH ANY ASPECT ANY ACCOMMODATIONS WITHIN THE SAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I WILL OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible] YES -- YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING THIS IN REVERSE NOT RIVERSIDE LONG BEACH I GATHER AT USING LONG BEACH AND YOU ALSO STILL DO THE TEST WE DO. SO YOU DO THEM BOTH BECAUSE I AS I LISTEN TO BOTH ARGUMENTS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR ACTUALLY HAVING YES CITY ON CAMPUS AND FREE. I DIDN'T HEAR HOW IT HAD. HOUSE STILL GIVING THE TEST WOULD HAVE A THE OTHER TESTS AS BACK WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT. ON STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE TEST IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE I MEAN. MY CONCERN IS ALWAYS BEEN WITH AN AYE WE HAVE CONTINUING THE SAME DATA SO THAT WE CAN ASSESS WHAT NOT STUDENTS ARE MAKING A KIND OF PROGRESS. AND WE'D LIKE TO THEM TO MAKE AND SO HE'S KIND OF TAKE A PIECE OUT YOU YOU KIND OF BREAK THE CYCLE IN TERMS OF PROGRESS BUT BUT I THINK YOU'RE CONVERSATIONS ALL SAID THAT YOU DO IT NOW. ARE YOU STILL DO THE OTHER TESTS CORRECT. SO IS WORKING NOW SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO TAKE OUT THERE BECAUSE I COULD SEE IS WANTING TO BASICALLY ENCOURAGE EVERY SCHOOL -- ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS LOW INCOME TO BASICALLY DO THE S. A. T. ON THEIR CAMPUS TO MAKE IT FREE FOR KIDS TO BLACK RESOURCES. TO HAPPEN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR THEM I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE OF EQUITY THAT THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. NOT SURE WHAT THE NEGATIVE IS OF YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE. SO BECAUSE WE DO ADMINISTER BOTH TESTS WERE INCREASE THE COST OF THOSE TASKS SO WHILE WE'RE BROADLY USING THE PS EIGHTY AN SAT FOR ALL OF THOSE YEARS WE THEN DO THE S. BACK AGAIN WHICH IS A FORTY TEST WHICH TAKES TIME OUT AT STUDENT LEARNING AND REFLECTION. BUT IT'S ALSO NOT INCENTIVIZE FOR THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR THEM SO FOR MY STUDENTS WHO TOOK THE ASPECT AS JUNIORS THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN THE SAT. AND THEY WERE WORKING TOWARDS COLLEGE ADMISSION BECAUSE TWO OF MY KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL OUT OF STATE -- SO THAT FOUR DAYS OF TESTING REALLY TOOK AWAY FROM WHAT THEY WERE DOING IT FROM A DISTRICT RESPECTED MORE THAN PAYING THE COST TO ADMINISTER A SECOND TEST. WHEN WE HAVE -- WHAT WE FEEL ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT METRICS AS WELL AS LONG TERM AT MULTI YEAR METRICS THAT WE CAN USE TO DO INTERVENTIONS IT IF I COULD IN EVERY ON QUICKLY AND EVERYBODY EVERY SINGLE TAKE THE SAT? THERE WOULD NOT BE SOME CRACKING AND SOME NOT SO WE OFFERED TWICE A YEAR ACTUALLY SO WE OFFER IT TODAY IN THE SPRING FOR YOUR STUDENTS WE ALSO OFFERED AGAIN FOR FREEIN THE FALL. FOR OUR SENIORS WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUMP UP THEIR SCORES FOR THEIR CSU INDEX FOR SOME OF THE MORE COMPETITIVE SCHOOLS HAVE A HIGHER REQUIREMENT. AND WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY AT THAT POINT FOR SOMEONE TO GAIN ADMISSION TO THE CSU IS TO CHANGE THEIR SAT SCORE THEY CAN'T CHANGE THEIR GPA AT THAT POINT. BUT WE DO THE MATH AND WE SEE THAT IF THEY GOT FOUR MORE QUESTIONS CORRECT ON THE SAT IN THE FALL THAT BUMPED UP THEIR ELIGIBILITY WHICH HELPS OUR LONG BEACH COLLEGE PROMISE. SO LAST YEAR WE HAD APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN STUDENTS WHO WERE JUST BARELY OFF THE COLLEGE PROMISE METRIC OF THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FOR CAL STATE LONG BEACH -- BUT WE NOTIFY THEM THEY KNEW WHAT THEIR SCORES THEY DID SOME REALLY INVALID INDIVIDUALIZED -- TUTORING IN THOSE AREAS AND APPROXIMATELY A HALF I BELIEVE WE'RE ABLE TO BUMP UP THEIR SAT A SCORE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THEM ADMISSION INTO CAL STATE LONG BEACH SO IT HAS VERY REAL TIME A FAX -- SO THAT'S OUR COMMITMENT TO THEM THAT WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THAT. YOU WANT TO TELL YOU I JUST WANT TO SHARE THEIR YOU JUST SAID IT BASICALLY IT'S AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. NOT JUST A TRYING SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS. ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WITHIN THAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM ARENA. AND IT INVESTED LISTEN KIDS A LOT OF GREAT. LOVE THEM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS REAL INVESTED IN THESE TESTS THAT DON'T MEAN A LOT TO THEM IN THE US BACK IS SUCH A TEST. AND ALSO TIME TO GO. TO THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH ADMINISTERING THE ASPECT ARE SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY SOME OF OUR LARGER HIGH SCHOOLS THEY WILL DISRUPT CLASSES FOR TWO THREE WEEKS SOMETIMES. JUST TO GET THAT TIME WINDOW -- THAT STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE THE ASPECT HAS TO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN AGAIN IN THAT ELEVENTH GRADE YOU'RE A LOT OF KIDS HAVE A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THERE'S A P. TASKS -- THERE'S COLLEGE APPLICATIONS THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON DURING THAT ELEVENTH GRADE YEAR. THAT I THINK GIVING -- THAT THIS APPROACH IS IS IS. IS SMARTER TESTING NOT JUST MORE TESTS. YEAH I'D LIKE TO WELL I I'M NOT SUPPORTED TO DOUSE THE I'LL TRY TO GET THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT HE HAD THAT HE SHARED WITH UP. WITH THAT BECAUSE I'VE HAD SOME CONCERNS BUT I THINK IT'S A I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SAT AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO WANT IT. I KNOW DOING ANYTHING ON CAMPUS SOMETIMES A POSITIVE EFFECT FOR STUDENTS AND SURELY PAYING FOR THAT NUMBER SCHOOL TO PAY FOR IT. AND AND AND IT'S A GOOD USE OF THE TITLE ONE DOLLARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE TO GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE I DON'T KNOW THE DATE WITH REGARD TO HOW WELL STUDENTS DO ON THAT KIND OF HIS VERSES IS BAD. I'M NOT SURE THE STUDENTS NOT MOTIVATED ON ANY TESTS IS NOT BE ON SAID MOTIVATED ON SAT WHEN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF OF GOING BEYOND WHERE THEY ARE YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS JUST GRADUATING IN DOING SOMETHING ELSE. I'M NOT TOO THERE'S A REAL BIG MOTIVATION FOR THAT BUT BUT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW. WHAT IT IS AND WHETHER NOT WE STILL NEED TOOLS TO ASSESS PUT FOR TEACHING WITH REGARDS TO THE S. BACK AS WITHIN OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS EFFECTIVE OR INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN? DOING THE SMARTER BALANCED WE'VE BEEN DOING THE NEW CORE CURRICULUM AND ALL THAT STUFF AND SO NEEDING TO CONSTANTLY ASSESS WHAT THE NOT STUDENTS ARE GETTING IT MOVING FORWARD WITH IT OR WHATEVER. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENS BUT I I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BASICALLY HAVE AN ON CAMPUS FOR EVERY STUDENT CHOOSE TO HAVE IT AT A COST OF THREE YES NO QUESTION. THANK YOU. AND THERE IS A THERE IS A STUDY OUT OF UC DAVIS I DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR OF THE STUDY WHICH SHOWS THAT THE TESTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED. AND AND AS FAR AS HOW THEY PREDICT COLLEGE SUCCESS AND THAT THE SAT IS ACTUALLY A SLIGHTLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT A SLIGHTLY BETTER PROTECT. YEAH BUT THE IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THE STUDY OFTEN SHOWS TO THAT. STUDENTS OF COLOR DO BETTER ON ACT AND SAT. AND SO IT WOULD PUSH EVERYBODY S. A. T. THERE WERE KIDS OF COLOR DON'T DO VERY WELL. BUT THEY DO MUCH BETTER IN A CITY BECAUSE OF THE FORMAT OF IT THEN WE MAY BE PUSHING THEM INTO AN AREA WHERE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS AND TALKING TO NOW WITH KIDS PUTTING THEM IN A CITIES PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAUSE IT CITIES HAS NOT BEEN. A WHATEVER THAT HONEST I'VE DONE AND ALL THE TESTS AND AGES BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BETTER TEST IN A BETTER ASSESSMENT. OF AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS SO IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SAT YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS IN THERE. THEY MAY STILL WANT TO TAKE THE ACT THE PANTS ARE CONSCIOUS OF IT SO THEY MAY FIND THEMSELVES ONCE AGAIN BEING TESTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY WANT TO CHEESE SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS THAT. EVEN AS A T. HAS ITS CULTURAL BIASES OF THE GENERALLY NOT IN FAVOR. OF KIDS OF COLOR YOU KNOW IT'S KIND LIKE THE I. Q. TESTS THEY DO WE ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF KIDS OF COLOR. AND THE TEST A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT THAT GOES FAR BEYOND WHAT TO DO IN THE CLASSROOM THE CLASSROOM HEALTH WHICH YOU CAN'T STUDY FOR THE SAT NOT REALLY. YOU CAN SAY THE FORMAT OF THE SAT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY BONE DOWN AND STUDY FOR THE SAT CAUSES ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO -- ANYWAY. WOULD BE INTERESTING SEEING WHATEVER DATED INFORMATION WE MIGHT HAVE CONCERNING BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT CHOICES DISTRICTS TO MAKE ONE THING IS GOING IT'S A CHOICE TO DISTRICTS CAN MAKE AND I HOPE THEY WILL. SERIOUSLY LOOK AT IT INCOME AND IN TERMS OF THE STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO SERVE AND THE COMMUNITY SAID OF THE AND HAVE THAT HOPEFULLY CONVERSATION INPUT FROM COMMUNITY SAID TAYLOR IT BEST FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THE DISTRICT. SO I LIKE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT SAYING SAT OR ACT WERE SAYING EITHER BUT AGAIN I I GET YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. WITH REGARD TO THE SAT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT HEARING NONE I WOULD YOU LIKE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE MISTER O'DONNELL -- JUST ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- AND THIS IS THIS THIS THIS BILL IS AOUT -- PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND AGAIN I ASTRONOMICAL [inaudible] OKAY.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS TAMMY MARTIN WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. AND OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SPONSORED A NUMBER OF BILLS TO MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER FOR LGBT Q. STUDENTS. BUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE. DATA SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF LGBT Q. STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA REGULARLY HERE ANTI LGBT Q. REMARKS AT SCHOOL AND ARE FREQUENT TARGETS OF HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS. EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND CONTEMPLATE SUICIDE THAN THEIR NON LGBT Q. PEERS. WE KNOW THESE DISPARITIES ARE WORSE FOR LGBTQ YOUTH WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE RESOURCES EXIST MANY LGBTQ STUDENTS REPORT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT SURPRISING WE RECENTLY SENT A SURVEY TO ALL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND OTHER DISTRICTS THAT RESPONDED JUST A HANDFUL REPORTED THAT THEY PROVIDE MANDATORY LGBT Q. CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING AND OVER A THIRD REPORTED THAT THEY DO NOT EVEN OFFER VOLUNTARY TRAINING. EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND ZIP CODE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THAT SHOT AT SUCCESS AND WE KNOW THEY WANT TO HELP. THAT'S WHAT THE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES AND CAREERS TO DOING. BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO DO SO. THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY FOUR NINETY THREE WHICH ADDRESSES THIS URGENT NEED BY PROVIDING TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF WITH THE TRAINING THEY NEED AND WANT. TO HELP LGBT Q. STUDENTS WERE BULLIED AT SCHOOL. REJECTED BY THEIR FAMILIES OR LACK ACCEPTANCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL WILL MAKE OUR SCHOOLS SAFER AND MORE INCLUSIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS. BECAUSE WHEN LGBT Q. STUDENTS FEEL SAFE AND SUPPORTED. THEIR FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES BENEFIT. TO SO WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA AND OUR CO SPONSOR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. FOR ADVANCING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF BY. HI THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS. THERE TURN MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR OF ANY PUMP HEY AND I'M HONORED TO SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FOR NINETY THREE AS A FORMER TEACHER SCHOOL COUNSELOR AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS. AND AUTHOR OF THE LGBT -- YOUTH REPORT. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE DESPERATE NEED FOR STAFF TRAINING ON SUPPORTING LGBT Q. STUDENTS. NOT ONLY ARE LGBT YOUTH EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS OF PURE BOWLING AND FAMILY REJECTION. BUT THEY ARE ALSO NOT FINDING ADEQUATE ADEQUATE SUPPORT FROM THEIR EDUCATORS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT ONLY CALIFORNIA SAY THAT ALL OF THEIR SCHOOL STAFF OR SUPPORT OF THE LGBT PEOPLE. WHEN STUDENTS FEEL SAFE AND CONNECTED AT SCHOOL THEIR ATTENDANCE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND GRADUATION RATES GO UP? UNFORTUNATELY THIS KNOWN FACT IS OFTEN IGNORED WHEN IT COMES TO LGBT Q. STUDENTS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SUBJECT MATTER MAKES DISTRICT DECISION MAKERS. UNCOMFORTABLE. LIKE ALL STUDENTS LGBT Q. STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO ATTEND SCHOOL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M SORRY SHOULD SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR CAMPUSES ARE SAFE AND INCLUSIVE OF LGBT STUDENTS. WITH NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH K. TWELVE SCHOOLS I HAVE YET TO FIND A CAMPUS AT A SAFE AND WELCOMING OF LGBTQ STUDENTS THAT HASN'T YET PROVIDED TRAINING FOR THEIR STAFF. I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT THE HARDWORKING EDUCATORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE HUNGRY FOR THIS TYPE OF TRAINING AND TO LEARN HOW TO BEST SUPPORT THEIR LGBT STUDENTS. BUT THEY NEED THIS BILL TO PASS SO THAT THIS NEEDED TRAINING BECOMES A REALITY. AB FOR NINETY THREE ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS OUR ETHICAL OBLIGATION AS INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF ALL STUDENTS I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS LIFESAVING BILL THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

WE DON'T KNOW. I WILL GO TO MISTER HOLDEN FILE ITEM NUMBER. WE'LL DO NINETEEN FILE ITEM NINETEEN FIRST. HE WILL HAVE TWENTY THREE AFTER THE FILING OF NINETEEN MISTER HOLD YOU MAY PERCEIVE ONE RIGHT. NINETY TWO FIRST [inaudible] MR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE EIGHTY TWO I'D LIKE TO LEAD OFF BY ACCEPTING THE A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES OF WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A STUDENT HAS EXCUSE ABSENCE TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE PEOPLE WITH MISTER SIMONS AND TESTS. HOWEVER FOR STUDENTS SUSPENDED IT IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE TEACHER TO PROVIDE OF MISSED WORK. EVEN IF THE STUDENT OR PARENT REQUESTED. AB NINE EIGHTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE TEACHERS TO PROVIDE MISSED HOMEWORK OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN REQUESTED WHEN A STUDENT IS SUSPENDED. AS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS EVEN WITH THE DECLINE IN SUSPENSIONS DISPARITIES STILL EXIST. AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS CONTINUE TO BE SUSPENDED AT MUCH HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER GROUPS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PREVENT STUDENTS FROM FALLING BEHIND AND BECOMING MORE OF A JUST DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS. IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO ADD ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO TEACHERS. SINCE THE TEACHERS ALREADY HAVE A PREPARED LESSON PLAN THEY WOULD JUST NEED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN UPON REQUEST. AB NINE EIGHTY TWO IS CLEAR THAT. THE GRADING OR PROVIDING CREDIT FOR THIS MISSED WORK IS UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE TEACHER. I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATING ALL STUDENTS. AND IF THE PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ENOUGH TO REQUEST THE HOMEWORK AND TEACHERS SHOULD PROVIDE THE-SAME CLASS WORK THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE EXCUSED. STUDENTS. IT IS SAFE TO SAY WE ARE ALL HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WANT ALL STUDENTS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SUCCEED. AND WE CANNOT IGNORE THE LASTING IMPACT THE SUSPENSIONS HAVE ON STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP. TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND TODAY I HAVE JACQUE WILSON FROM ADVOCATES FOR JUSTICE JOINING ME. AS A WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHOCK WILSON I AM A CO FOUNDER OF ADVOCATES FOR JUSTICE. A BOARD MEMBER OF CRLA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M A PARENT AND I'M ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS WITHOUT A VOICE. AS ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS I KNOW FIRST HAND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT A SUSPENSION HOUSE ON A STUDENT -- SUSPENDED STUDENTS OFTEN FALL BEHIND IN SCHOOL DISENGAGE DROPOUT BECOME VICTIMS OF THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WHICH IS WHY IN CALIFORNIA -- SUSPENSIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A DISCIPLINARY TOOL OF LAST RESORT. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY TWO IS NOT ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR SUSPENDED STUDENTS. IT ONLY SIX THAT WE WILL ATTEMPT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SUSPENDED STUDENTS BY GIVING THEM FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO THE CLASS ASSIGNMENTS. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I ON BEHALF OF ADVOCATES FOR JUSTICE CONDUCTED A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST. A MODESTO CITY SCHOOLS AND WE DISCOVERED THAT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT THERE WAS A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE AFRICAN AMERICANS. THE ROLE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. THESE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WERE SUSPENDED A RECEIPT THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF A SUSPENSION MORE THAN FORTY ONE HUNDRED TIMES. NO OTHER STUDENT GROUP EXPERIENCES THIS TYPE OF GROSS DISAPPEAR DESPITE DISPROPORTION AUDI INSISTS PENSIONS OR DISCIPLINE IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. WHAT WAS EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS THAT THE STUDENTS WERE BEING WAREHOUSE MANY OF THEM ALL DAY WITHOUT ACCESS TO THEIR SCHOOL WORK AND WERE EVEN ALLOWED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES AND WATCH VIDEOS ON THEIR CELL PHONES? ABC TEN INVESTIGATORS RAN A TEN MINUTE SEGMENT ON THIS. THE GROSS ABUSE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IN CALIFORNIA WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO MISS CRITICAL CLASSROOM TIME AND THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. ACCORDING TO DATAQUEST IN TWO THOUSAND SO YOU SUMMARIZE. PLEASE SUMMERS OKAY START BACK UP THE CORDON -- AB NINE EIGHTY TWO IS ONE WAY OF KEEPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOL ENGAGE. IN THE IN THE SCHOOL THIS PROCESS OF PIPELINE I SUPPORT EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY TWO BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE TECHNICAL EDUCATION. EXPERIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THANK YOU VERY WELL DONE. YOUR NEXT WITNESS [inaudible] THAT'S THE ONLY ONE WITH US OKAY -- YEAH I DO NOT RIGHT -- OKAY OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD AND STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION OF THE ERIC HAIRS WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SEEM TO OTHERS ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I SEE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OF RING UP BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS MISTER HOLDEN THERE WERE THREE OF THEM. AND IT REALLY ONE OF MY CONCERNS AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER -- WHICH I SHARED WITH YOU WAS. THANK YOU THERE'S OKAY I'M SORRY TWO MINUTES TWO MINUTES WAS -- THAT I TEACHER NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER ONE STUDENT BE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT HOMEWORK THAT WOULD HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN ASSIGNED SHOULD THEY BE THERE. AND YEAH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT A TEACHER NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE TO RESPOND TO A CALL FROM THE OFFICE STOP TEACHING AND AND AND GATHER UP HOMEWORK FOR STUDENTS WHO SUSPENDED BUT THAT. IT BE HANDED OFF TO A STUDENT WHO MATTER IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND YOU AGREE TO THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A CHARTER MEMBER TOO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS READY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER MCCARTY YEAH THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ANYWAY IF SOMEONE'S. BEING SUSPENDED HAVE THEM WORK ON THEIR HOMEWORK AND LET'S FACE IT YOU'RE RIGHT STUDENTS WHO GET SUSPENDED. I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE A DROP OUTS IN THE COST OF LAST TIME I CHECKED IN YOUR OWN COUNTY LA COUNTY JUVENILE HALLS ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAND A YEAR FOR SOMEONE IN JUVENILE HALL STUFF. COSTS ARE TREMENDOUS JUST CURIOUS I DIDN'T ANY OPPOSITION BUT HAD HAS THE HAVE THAT SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION -- EXCEPT IN THE PROVIDING FEEDBACK. IF THEY OPPOSE OR SUPPORTER OF THE CONCERNS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM HERE BEHIND YOU DOING AT ME TOO BUT YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT -- FOR US FROM THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY ON THIS BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY DIRECTLY NINE OR AT LEAST MY OFFICE IS NOW. THE COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION YEAH AND I HAVE BEEN TELLING ME TALKING TO THEM AND WHAT'S THEIR FEEDBACK FROM THE FROM ACCESS OR CSPA. WELL I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF REGULARLY INTERACTS WITH ADVOCATES REMOVES ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED. NO FEEDBACK ON THIS BILL SO WE ASSUME THERE RIGHT. NEUTRAL OR POSSIBLY EVEN SUPPORT OF MAYBE THEY'RE RELEVANT ORGAN -- BODIES HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT IF YOU WANT TO DRUM UP OPPOSITION. THIS MIGHT BE THE WAY TO DO IT. GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MARC SUMMERS ON BEHALF OF ACCESS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE BILL I WE HAVE NO CONTRACT THIS MOMENT BUT WILL GET WITH AUTHORED OFFICER IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU. ERICA HOW CAN I BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION I CAN JUST SAY DITTO WE'VE GOT A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE MEETING COMING UP IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND IT IS ALREADY ON MY LIST TO TAKE THE BILL THERE FOR POSITION. YES I'M TRYING TO GET TO SUPPORT SIDE FOR THAT MISTER RIGHT. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WHEN YOU'RE THE DICE YOU QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD. THIS MCCARTY HAS A DIFFERENT VISION APPARENTLY. NEVER NEVER ROBBING A BANK WITH YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS REALLY COMING DOCTOR WEBER. OKAY DOCTORS MISS SMITH. THANK YOU I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WHAT IN WHAT I THINK IS A FIRST SMALL STEP TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TERMS OF RE DIRECTING SOME OF OUR OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW RATHER THAN THINKING IN TERMS OF REMOVING THEM FROM A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. INSTRUCTIONAL TIME ALL TOGETHER WE'VE GOT TO START GETTING THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE MOST INTENSIVE REMEDIES AND AN ON THE SPOT -- ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WE CAN BE MAKING FOR THESE KIDS TO HELP THEM STAY ON THE PATH FOR AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL CARE SO I I THINK YOU FOR THIS. DR WEB YES MR HOLDEN WELL THANK YOU I THINK YOU BROUGHT THIS FOURTH ONCE BEFORE WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SOME WHILE AGO. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU -- STICKING WITH IT AND BRINGING IT FORWARD. I ONLY HAVE ONE PROBLEM AND THAT IS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE HOME WOULD BE GREAT IT. AND I I AND I AND AND THAT IS STATED THERE -- AND I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ABOUT THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK -- I'M IF MY UNDERSTANDS CORRECT OUR SCHOOLS ARE STILL GETTING PAID EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN KIDS ARE SUSPENDED. SO THE MONEY IS STILL COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL WILD KIDS ARE NOT THE YOURSELF -- HAVING GIVE HOMEWORK AND THEN HAVE NO ONE TO GREAT IT -- MAYBE THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT MATTER IF THE DEAL WITH ALGEBRA WHATEVER IT MAY BE. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT -- IT'S NICE TO TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE MATERIAL I THINK IT'S BETTER TO TO KEEP THEM IN THE PROCESS TO HAVE THE TEACHERS OF GRADE MATERIAL. I YOU KNOW I JUST I I SAW THAT I THOUGHT WELL WHY WOULD. YOU GIVE HOMEWORK IN SOME CASES SEAT IS BUSY WORK UP BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN GREAT. AND SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THE CLASS THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME HOPEFULLY UNDERSTANDING AS OTHERS. BEING SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL IS PUNITIVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW NOT WHICH APPEARS AND TO LEARN THE KID MIGHT THINK IT'S A GREAT THING. BUT I THINK AS A PARENT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN FOR YOUR CHILD MS TWO DAYS. OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE -- SO I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHY WOULD NOT ASKING FOLKS TO GRADE THE HOMEWORK. THAT WOULD GIVING WORK BUT WE'RE NOT ASKING TO BE GRADED RIGHT -- I APPRECIATE THE THE QUESTION DOCTOR WHATEVER I IT'S A RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THAT. IT WAS NOT. NOT WHAT. THAT THAT I I I DIDN'T. THAT ACTUALLY DID NOT COME FROM THE COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION YOU SHOULD HAVE GOING FORWARD. ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS GREAT AND I GET. I GET THE CONCERNED WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THEM DO IT IF IT'S NOT GREAT MY OWN CLASSROOM HONESTLY I I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SIGNING WORK TO STUDENTS SUSPENDED AND THEN GRADING IT. WASN'T A CHALLENGE TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER THAT YOU WOULD DO THAT SO I THINK WE SHOULD DO IS KIND OF LIKE GOING FOR WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD INCLUDE THAT. I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO TO INCLUDE IT -- AND AND I I I UNDERSTAND IT'S IT'S I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE ACTUAL WORK OF THE TEACHERS WILL BE GREEN HOMEWORK ANYWAY. I WOULD HOPE THAT A TEACHER WOULD HAVE THAT MAYBE IT'S SUSPENDED STUDENTS THAT BETTER. IT BECOMES. A YOU KNOW UNBELIEVABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I I THINK IT HAS VALUE TO BE ABLE TO FOR THE STUDENTS KNOW THAT THIS WORK MATTERS -- AND AND THEY NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND IT ALSO GIVES SOME LEVERAGE TO PARENTS. TO GET THE WORK DONE AND GET IT DONE A CORRECTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME RESPONSE BACK AS TO HOW WELL THE STUDENT DID FOR THOSE TWO DAYS THEY HAD TO DO. IT WOULD HOME DOING HOMEWORK SO. I THINK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER I THINK IT STRENGTHENS IT MUCH MORE THAN JUST SIMPLY ASKING FOR CAUSES LIKE MAYBE BUSY WORK WHATEVER. THAT IT OUGHT TO HAVE SOME VALUE AND IT KEEPS THE STUDENTS ON TRACK WITH THE CLASS I CAN AGREE WITH YOU MORE DOCTOR WEBER AND THIS YEAR SO WITH YOUR CONCURRENCE WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL. ON YOUR OF TODAY AND WE WILL LOOK. TO SEE THAT -- ISSUE RESOLVED THANK YOU ALONG THE WAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION. SOMEBODY WOULD BUT IF NOT I'LL MOVE IT SO MOVE.

CREDIT RECOVERY PROGRAMS LET'S STUDENTS WHO FAIL A CLASS RECOVERY CREDIT THE ABBREVIATED MAKE UP. COURSES [inaudible] DONE WELL. THE RECOVERY PROGRAMS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A LEGITIMATE SECOND CHANCE TO GRADUATE ON TIME. BUT SOMETIMES BUT SOME PARTICULAR HIGH VOLUME PROGRAMS OF QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS THAT CREATE A SECOND TRACK TO GRADUATION THAT A ROAD SCHOOL CULTURES AND LOWERS EXPECTATIONS. PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS UNFORTUNATELY TOO LITTLE IS KNOWN ACROSS THE NATION AND IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THESE PROGRAMS. WE SHOULD INCREASE ATTENTION TO THESE RAPIDLY EXPANDING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THEY ARE HELPING NOT HARMING STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO GRADUATE. CURRENTLY CDC CUT COLLECTS NO DATA ON CREDIT RECOVERY PROGRAMS AND THERE IS NO DEFINITION OR REGULATION OF CREDIT RECOVERY AND STATUTES. AB TEN NINETY SEVEN IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE THAT DIRECTS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO REPORT. ON THE USE OF CREDIT RECOVERING CALIFORNIAN ALSO DEFINES CREDIT RECOVERY IN STATUTE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WILL KEEP ON WORKING ON MY HAND WRITING IT WAS NOT MY STRONGEST GRADE IN SCHOOL CLEARLY. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND READY TO LEARN. SINCE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS OF AN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DIRECT HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED AT SCHOOL SIDES. THROUGH SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY MEDICAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. DUE TO A RECENT FEDERAL CHANGE THESE PROGRAMS THAT USED TO BE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. ARE NOW OPEN ALL MEDI CAL OKAY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THIS CHANGE ALLOWS FOR MANY MORE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TO RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL INCLUDING HEALTH EVALUATIONS PHYSICIAN SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES. WHEN POORLY TREATED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BEHAVIOR? AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO INSTITUTIONALIZED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH OVERSEES MEDICARE NOW AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COORDINATE VARIOUS HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. DELIVERED THROUGH SCHOOLS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMINISTERING HEALTH RELATED PROGRAMS IN ADVISING ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE DELIVERY. OF SCHOOL BASED MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE STATE. WITH THE EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE. IN ASSISTING SCHOOLS THAT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS MAY CONTINUE RECEIVING HEALTH. AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL SITES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND WITH ME OUR LEASE -- EISENBERG FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE. AND TONI TRADUCTOR GUERO FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LISA EISENBERG ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR OF AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO I'M OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING VOICES IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY YEARS BRINGING TOGETHER HEALTH AND EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE ARE EXCITED THAT THIS BILL IS A NATURAL NEXT STEP IN STRENGTHENING THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS RELATED TO SCHOOL BASED HEALTH YOU'VE DONE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THE SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS. SO YOU ALL ARE WELL WELL AWARE OF THE GREAT NEED FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES. AND ALSO THE BENEFIT OF PROVIDING HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOL SETTING AND I'M NOT GOING TO COVER A BUNCH OF DATA -- YOU MIGHT ALSO BE AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BRING THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT SILOS TOGETHER HEALTH AND EDUCATION. SCHOOLS ARE NOT NATURALLY SET UP TO BE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND BILL HEALTH CARE FUNDING STREAMS. NOR DOES OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT'S FAMILIAR WITH DOCTORS CLINICS HOSPITALS. AUTOMATICALLY UNDERSTAND HOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN AT THE FRONT LINES FOR ENROLLING KIDS IN HEALTH COVERAGE IDENTIFYING STUDENTS WITH ASTHMA SCREENING STUDENTS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS RECOGNIZING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES TO NAME A FEW. ALSO AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HAS NOTED -- WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE'S THIS GREAT CHANGE COMING THAT WILL ALLOW OUR SCHOOL MEDICAID PROGRAM TO OPEN UP REIMBURSEMENT FOR SCHOOLS. NOT JUST TO STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT STUDENTS -- AND MEDICAL STUDENTS OVERALL THIS IS EXCITING THIS IS GONNA DRAW DOWN THE NUMBER OF REVENUES IN REVENUE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND IT'S GOING. TO GROW THE ROLE THAT SCHOOLS ARE PLAIN IN PROVIDING SOME OF THESE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'M. THIS IS GOING TO MEAN AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR A STATE LEVEL COORDINATION AND STATE LEVEL SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR SCHOOLS -- THESE ARE OURALL REASONS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OTHER STATES DO THIS MEDICAID IN EDUCATION WORK WELL TOGETHER AND OTHER STATES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DO TRAININGS -- AND PLAN FOR FEW. STANCHION -- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND URGE YOUR EYES THANK YOU AGAIN YOUR NEXT WITNESS MISTER CHAIR TONY TOOK CARE ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THE SERGEANTS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU AN ABBREVIATED COPY OF A MARCH FOURTEENTH LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE EXAMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE AUDIT POINTS OUT CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTIETH IN THE COUNTRY. AND IS CONSISTENTLY BELOW 50% FOR UTILIZATION RATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN -- ON MEDI CAL IN CALIFORNIA AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS WERE IDENTIFIED FOR REPAYMENT. THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DH CS DID NOT CONTEST TO DISPUTE THE AUDIT OF A HANDFUL OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS. BUT THE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION REPAYMENT IS SPREAD ACROSS ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. A PARTICIPATING IN THE LA. MEDI CAL BILLING PROGRAM HAD DH CS PROVIDED MORE ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS AND PROTESTED THE AUDIT FINDINGS. SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR OF MUCH NEEDED DOLLARS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE CHAIRS A. B. THIRTY ONE NINETY TWO REQUIRING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN CONSULTATION WITH HALEY AGE THE AD HOC WORK GROUP IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ED TO PREPARE AND COMPLETE A FISCAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT GUIDE. TO THE LA A MEDI CAL BILLING PROGRAM IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM IN SCHOOLS REQUIRE REQUIRE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION. OF THE PROGRAM TO APPROPRIATELY BILL FOR THE HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. THIS IS KEY TO SCHOOLS CONTINUING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IN RECENT YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE HAD TROUBLE RECEIVING CLEAR AND CONSISTENT GUIDANCE FROM DH CS ON HAD A BILL FOR SERVICES IN A COMPLIANT MANNER AND IN SOME CASES. PRIOR AUDITING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVELY APPLIED TO CURRENT CLAIMS SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE CEASED PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS. THIS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF AN ALLEY A TO PROVIDE HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS. RUN SMOOTHLY AND MAXIMIZE FUNDING ELIGIBILITY SCHOOLS REQUIRE SUPPORT FROM STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH HEALTH AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AB THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISHING OPS OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH WILL ASSIST SCHOOLS BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL CAUSES. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOW NOT AVAILABLE FROM DH CS THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES LATER THIS YEAR WAS TO SCHOOLS IN PROMOTING HEALTHIER OUTCOMES.

FOR ALL FOR YOU WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT THIS BILL SEEKS TO REQUIRE THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PROBATION IS DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. AN INDIVIDUALIZED TRANSITION PLAN TO MEET THE ACADEMIC BEHAVIOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND CAREER NEEDS. OF ARE YOU TRANSITIONING FROM JUVENILE -- COURT SCHOOL. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE TRANSITION PERIOD WHEN YOU ARE LEAVING TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITY. IS AT TIMELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. THEY MAY HAVE TROUBLE RE ENROLLING. IN SCHOOL GETTING NECESSARY SCHOOL DOCUMENTS RECEIVING CREDIT FOR THEIR COURT -- SCHOOL -- COURSE WORK GETTING -- INFORMATION ON COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT WILL PREPARE THEM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND ALSO CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA SOME COUNTIES HAVE TRANSITION PLANS WITH THE DESIGNATED PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH THE YOUTH AND RECEIVING SCHOOL TO MAKING SURE THAT THE TRANSITION OF THAT YOU. GOALS ACCORDING TO PLAN. THE KEY WORD IS PLAN. BUT THERE IS THE ISSUE -- THAT SOME KIDS AGAIN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THROUGH THE THIS BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE NO CHILD FALLS BE THROUGH THE CRACKS EXISTING LAW IN ACTIVE -- SIDE OF AB TWENTY TWO OF SEVENTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REQUIRE THE STE THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A JOINT TRANSITION PLAN. POLICY THAT INCLUDES COLLABORATION WITH RELEVANT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES RELATING TO JUVENILE COURT SCHOOL STUDENTS HOWEVER IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH IN MANDATING THAT THE TRANSITION SUPPORT NEEDED.

THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT BEING MET BECAUSE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT DESIGNATE ONE AGENCY ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING MAY HAPPEN. THIS BILL REQUIRES A TRANSITION PLAN. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT IT REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTY OFFICES OF AT OVERSEE THE TRANSITION PROCESS FOR ALL COURT SCHOOL PUPILS REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN IN THE FACILITY.

AS AMENDED AB NINE SIX SEVEN INCLUDES CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITIES IN THE EL CAP PROCESS AND SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF ALIGNING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THAT OF ALL STATE ELEAZAR. FOR FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING DATA DRIVEN AND RIGOROUS LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AND MEANINGFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SEES IN EL CAP DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY. YELL CFF REQUIRES THAT ELEAZAR CONSULT WITH PARENTS STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR AL CAPS AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES. HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AT ELIMINATING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. DURING MY TENURE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WE HAD AN EXTREMELY ROBUST EL CAP PROCESS. IN SO DOING WE WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND STAFF IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VERY USEFUL PLANNING TOOL. UNFORTUNATELY AT PRESENT NOT ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY AND MEANS TO ACCEPT ACCESS THEIR SCHOOL BOARDS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE EL CAP PROCESS. AB NINE SIX SEVEN BRINGS CHARTER SCHOOLS INTO ALIGNMENT WITH ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PROVIDES THE EL CAP AS A UNIFORM AND STANDARD BASIS FOR COMPARISON TO MONITOR STUDENT OUTCOMES ACROSS THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES AND TARGETED SUBGROUPS ACROSS ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS CONSISTENCY WILL LEAD TO GREATER COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR ELLIE A AND CHARTER ENDEAVORS. AND A CLEAR ROADMAP FOR ELLIE A AND CHARTER BUDGET PRIORITIES AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS -- WITH ME OUR RYDELL SPENCER MASSARO FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATE SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE AND MARYLAND WE ARE A MOTHER OF STUDENTS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM.

AT THE TRAINING PARENTS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR SCHOOLS HAD FEWER OR NO REQUIREMENTS AROUND ALL COPPING GAUGE MEANT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS COMPARED TO THEIR DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS. AFTER THIS TRAINING PUBLIC ADVOCATES CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS OF SEVENTY CHARTER SCHOOL -- CAPS PUBLISHED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. WE FOUND THAT ONE THIRD OF ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS EXAMINED HAD NO WELL COP ONLINE EVEN AFTER EMAIL REQUESTS TO THE SCHOOL. OF THE CUPS WE COULD FIND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE FUNDS GENERATED BY HIGH NEED STUDENTS OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WERE UNACCOUNTED. FOR ONLY 21% CLEARLY MEASURED HOW THE ENGAGED PARENTS AND SCHOOL DECISION MAKING.

WEBER AYE THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES IT IS ON CALL [inaudible] WITH THAT. WILL MOVE -- TO FILE ITEM NUMBER. THIRTEEN THIS IS A MAP. TO THE CHAIR. TO OKAY WE SHOULD JUST ON THE BILL OKAY SO WHERE WE GOING NOW. FILE ITEM THIRTEEN IS GONZALEZ YOU MAY PROCEED ALREADY IT'S FUN MY THIRTEEN OF EIGHTY SEVEN SEVEN THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO STARTUP ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN SEVEN THREE WOULD HELP EQUIP OUR YOUNG ADULTS WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO BECOME ELECTORALLY ENGAGE CITIZENS. BY REQUIRING LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMMING FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN RECENT YEARS THIS BODY HAS PASSED SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION AIMED AT INCREASING VOTER REGISTRATION IN MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. HOWEVER IN THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO DIFFERENT VENUES. THROUGH WHICH TO CAST BALLOTS SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY FEEL OVERWHELMED AND SIMPLY CONFUSED THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR OUR NEWEST VOTERS. MOST YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO VOTE AT LEARN HOW VOTING WORKS BY WATCHING THEIR PARENTS OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. HOWEVER DUE TO DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES MANY YOUNG CITIZENS NOW COME FROM FAMILIES IN WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER VOTED OR MAY NOT BE EVEN ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. FOR THOSE STUDENTS THAT DO NOT LEARN HOW TO VOTE FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS THE OTHER PRIMARY AVENUE IS THROUGH THEIR CIVICS EDUCATION CURRICULUM. WELL I CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK INCLUDES A CIVICS EDUCATION COMPONENT THERE IS NO MANDATED OR SPECIFIED INSTRUCTION MODEL THE TEACHERS MUST IMPLEMENT IN THE CLASSROOM. THIS RESULTED INSTRUCTION MODULES THAT VARY FROM CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM IN SOME INSTANCES CAN BE GLOSSED OVER IN A LESSON PLAN. THIS ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A YOUNG ADULT POPULATION THAT IS UNCERTAIN WITH HOW TO PARTICIPATE ELECTORAL PROCESS IT'S NO LONGER ENOUGH TO SIMPLY REGISTER YOUNG VOTERS WE NEED TO LITERALLY TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO VOTE IN DEMYSTIFIED ENTIRE ELECTORAL PROCESS. AB SEVEN SEVEN THREE WILL HELP DO THAT BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. LOCAL COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMMING IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO LECTURE IN SYSTEM IN THEIR COUNTY. I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES WITH ME HERE TODAY AND I ULTIMATELY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE DOCTOR WEBER. MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHARON WHITEHURST PAIN AND I AM THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS PLEASE TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN LORENA GONZALEZ. AS A CO SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVEN SEVEN THREE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAM IN FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. WE SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD. HELP OUR STUDENTS TO ACQUIRE THAT TANGIBLE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER -- TO BECOME REGISTERED VOTERS AND TO VOTE. I AM TOTALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SAN DIEGO HAS ALREADY BEEN ON THAT PATH IN THIS PAST SEPTEMBER. WE HAD THE A CONGRESSMAN FROM JOHN LEWIS FROM WASHINGTON DC TO SPEAK TO MORRIS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THAT AND I'LL. TO REGISTERING STUDENTS IN GETTING INVOLVED THEMSELVES WE ALSO HAVE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AT LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL. AND OUR STUDENTS GOT THE MESSAGE THEY ARE THEY KNOW THE PROCESS LOGISTICALLY BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T REALIZE THAT A LOT OF TIMES IT JUST STICKS. IS A PROBLEM FOR THEM SO THEY HAVE THAT TRAINING AND NOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING IT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I REQUEST AN IPHONE FOR ME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STAFF. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK TODAY WE APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. THE DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES OF BOTH -- THE THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FOR THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME STANDARDIZATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL. PROGRAM BY ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE BUT WE FURTHER A PRIEST OF APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE BILL ALLOWS. AND FOR COUNTY OFFICE ELECTION OFFICES TO WORK ON THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE FLEXIBILITY THIS ALLOWS FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THIS IN AN ENERGETIC -- PROACTIVE AND ENERGIZE MANNER WHAT WE KNOW IS WHEN STUDENTS ARE -- ENGAGE AND ENERGIZE THEY PARTICIPATE WHEN THEY PARTICIPATE -- THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THE VOTE AND WE KNOW THAT IF WE WANT TO HELP ELEAZAR BE -- PROVIDE TOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO THEIR STUDENTS TO BECOME MORE ACTIVE CITIZENS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- IN THEIR COLLEGES AND ON THE WORLD STAGE. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IS SOMEONE THE LONG ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX BUT THE YEAH I LIKE TO THINK THAT A COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHOR ON RECENT AMENDMENTS AND MORE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THE TRAVELING ALMOST IN THE SAME PATH I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HEARD IT THIS MORNING -- THAT DEALS WITH -- VOTER EDUCATION IN HIGH SCHOOLS SO HOPEFULLY YOU GUYS WILL COORDINATED BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO BUT I SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM A COMMITTEE MEMBER SAYING ON YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. YES OKAY THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE THE TWO ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING -- YOU MAY CLOSE. I I JUST WANNA POINT OUT FOR DR WEBBER THAT I THINK IT'S ASSEMBLY WOMAN AT GARY CURRY'S BILL AND I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THAT TO ANOTHER ON THAT BILL AS WELL. THERE IS THERE SOME DIFFERENCES -- WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IT'S HARD TO KIND OF GET WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A REALIZATION THAT A LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN A BALLOT? THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINALLY REGISTER THEM IN AND THEN WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO AND I KNOW -- FOR FOR GROWN ADULTS THE FIRST TIME THEY VOTE IT CAN BE SCARY BUT WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN AND YOU'RE EXPECTED TO JUST GO FIND. POLLING LOCATION AND YOUR NAME IN CASE SOME BALLOTS ARE CONFUSING AND WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO JUST THAT FEAR OF NEVER BEING EXPOSED -- IT IS IS A BARRIER AND SO WE WANT TO TRY TO REDUCE THAT WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT TIME POSSIBLE FROM CURRICULUM AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU I RESPECT LASSEN ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU KNOW JUST A COMMENT AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER OFTEN HAD KIDS REGISTER IN CLASS. AND HATE TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS VOTING IMPORTANCE OF IT AND THEN THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATE WITH I THINK WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE BETTER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY BRING A VOTING BOOTH IN THE CLASS MEAN ACTUALLY SHOW THE MACHINE AND SHOW THEM THAT PROCESS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN ADULTS. WHO ARE CONFUSED BY THAT PROCESS% SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUR BILL CAN ADDRESS THAT AS WELL I HOPE IT DOES -- WITH THAT -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING. O'DONNELL O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NO KALRA. MCCARTY. SMITH SMITH I WEBER. WEBER I THE BILL IS ON CALL AS THREE VOTES. THREE ROOMS. VOTER FILE ITEM I MISS REYES FILE ITEM NUMBER. ONE EIGHTY SIX FILE ITEM. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TO THEIR PRESENT AB SIX A BILL WHICH CREATES THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. INCREASING THE CAPACITY IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR ALL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMING. THIS GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE CAME AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE SPEAKERS A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THIS COMMISSION WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR TWO YEARS AT ASSESSING ALL ASPECTS OF THE VERY COMPLEX EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION STRUCTURE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEREAFTER PREPARED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. WITH A LONG ARRAY OF PLANS. TO EXPAND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FROM CHILD CARE TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WITH PROPOSALS BY EVERYONE FROM THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR AND A MULTITUDE OF LEGISLATORS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ELEVATE. EXISTING GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE COMING INFLUX. OF PROGRAM EXPANSION. THIS NEW BRANCH WILL HELP SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUCCEEDING WHILE THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR CONTINUE TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON EXPANDING THIS CRUCIAL ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THE VERY NATURE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD. EDUCATION REQUIRES A VARIETY OF STATE AGENCIES MIXED MATHIS DRILL DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND HAS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WITH PARTICULAR NEEDS. THE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS WITHIN THE NEWLY CREATED BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT ALL PROGRAMMING REMAINS COORDINATED HIGH QUALITY AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE FAMILIES THE PROGRAM SERVES. FOR THE MORE PRO ACTIVE EXAMINATION CREATION OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES FOR RAPIDLY EXPANDING AREAS OF EDUCATION RATHER THAN REACTIVE CAN ENSURE THAT THE PLAN SET FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. AND OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTERED FROM THE START. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS THE GREATEST EQUALIZER THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROVIDE FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE THESE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS IN A COORDINATED AND EFFICIENT MANNER. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK MORE ON THE ISSUE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PARENT TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IS DONNA ARE TO COVERAGE AFTERNOON. REMEMBER OF DIAL UP IT'S NOT ON GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DONNA ARE TO COVERAGE. I AM A FORMER TEACHER AND A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I ALSO HOLD A MASTER'S DEGREE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO THIS. THIS ISSUE IS VERY DEAR TO MY HEART BY THE WAY I'M A MIDDLE CHILD ALSO. I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON WELL. I AM HERE THIS AFTERNOON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIX THE RESEARCH AND THE EXPERTS AGREE THE EARLY YEARS OF A CHILD ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL IN TERMS OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. PROVIDING QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION DURING THESE YEARS ENHANCES A CHILD'S OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. ALL OF YOU HERE ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OUR FOCUS ON HOW TO MAKE OUR K. TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM BETTER. WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND BEYOND? ONE WAY ONE CENTRAL CONCRETE RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY TO IMPROVE OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM IS TO FOCUS ON THE EARLY YEARS. FIVE FIVE WHEN A CHILD ENTERS OUR SYSTEM. WELL IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE. IF CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CARE AND EDUCATION IN THEIR EARLY YEARS THEY QUICKLY FALL BEHIND IN SCHOOL AND HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME CATCHING UP. OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF CARING FOR IN EDUCATING INFANTS TODDLERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN IS IN DISARRAY. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE IS HANDLED BY MULTIPLE AGENCIES HOUSED IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AND REQUESTS MULTIPLE AND DUPLICATE THE FACT APPLICATIONS. PARENTS DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO GO TO SEE CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL SERVICES THEY'RE CONFUSED AND CONFOUNDED AND OFTEN GIVE UP. OR PERHAPS TO NOT EVEN KNOW THAT ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF PARENTS WHO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS AND OUR LOW INCOME EARNERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF PARENTS WHO SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE AND ESPECIALLY TO OF PARENTS LOOKING TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE WONDERING HOW TO JUGGLE. CHILDCARE AND A JOB BY CREATING THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION GRANTS BRANCH UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THERE WOULD BE ONE CENTRAL LOCATION FOR PARENTS ONE CENTRAL OFFICE. TO COORDINATE SERVICES AND GIVE PARENTS THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO FIND QUALITY HEARING SPOT FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS IDEA WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY YEARS AND WE AYE VOTE ON AB SIX THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT TONY TOOK CARE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR EFFORTS. ON THIS BILL. BEFORE I BECAME A STATE LEGISLATOR I TAUGHT MATH FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- LOW INCOME MOST OF THEM ARE -- FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENOUGH COLOR. AND I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND HOW EXPERIENCE MATTERS TO THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE INTO THEIR SUCCESS. I GOT TO SEE MY GROWTH OVER THE THIRTEEN YEARS FROM BEING A NOVICE TEACHER TO BE IN A PROFICIENCY SIR. AND I WOULD HOPE BY THE END I WAS A GOOD TEACHER I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS AN EXCELLENT TEACHER. I ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE SOME OF THE SAME STUDENTS THAT I HAD MY FIRST YEAR OR WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THEM PRE ALGEBRA. AND THEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING IN GEOMETRY THIRTY YEARS LATER AND I GOT TO SEE THE BEARS I HAD IN TEACHING GEOMETRY BECAUSE THEY HAD ANOTHER PAGE WITH A LIST WAS HAVE TAUGHT THEM. THE FIRST TIME AND THAT'S CANNELLA WHEN I SAY IT'S KINDA HAVE THIS. IDEA IN MY BELLY OF OF THIS PIECE IN IT WELL I'VE BEEN HERE -- FOR THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR IT I'VE TAKEN A WHILE TO SAY TO JUMP INTO THE INTO THIS INTO THE SPACE -- AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE AT THE END OF THE DAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. QUALIFIED EXPERIENCED TEACHERS WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS OUT THERE -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT TO DAY SEVEN TWO DAYS AB TWO TWENTY ONE TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT UNDER TRAINED AND UNTRAINED. TEACHERS FROM IN TERM PROGRAMS OF NOW OUTLINED. IN. THE AMENDMENTS WHICH INCLUDES TEACH FOR AMERICA. WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN THE CLASSROOM WE KNOW THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN DATA HAS BEEN HARD TO ABSTAIN TO OBTAIN AND DEPENDING ON HOW YOU TALK TO OR TALKING ABOUT. 70% OF THOSE TEACHERS ARE 85% OF THOSE TEACHERS EVEN WITHIN THREE YEARS THE CLASSROOMS ARE RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE GETTING TO PROFICIENCY WERE LOSING THEM -- WE KNOW THAT THE STUDENTS -- ARE ARE. THE STUDENTS HAVE A LOT OF BARRIERS IN FRONT OF THEM -- AND AS HER LEARNING ON THE JOB WITH THEM WE'RE CREATING HOLES FOR THEM ALONG THE WAY IN AFFECTING THEIR EARNING POTENTIAL DOWN THE ROAD. AS I EXAMINED THE DATA FURTHER ON TV AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CENTER PROGRAMS I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PAYING ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE PLACEMENT OF THESE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS INTO. THEIR CLASSROOMS MONIES THAT I FEEL SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CLASSROOMS WHETHER IT'S FOR TEACHER INCREASE US SALARIES WHETHER IT'S FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR JUST FOR OUR STUDENTS OUT THERE -- WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE I'D ACCEPTED -- I'VE BEEN REPLACED BY THIS ISSUE AND I HAD KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A TEACHER SHORTAGE BUT I'M LET MYSELF ASKING THE QUESTION IS THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION.

MOST PROMINENT PEER REVIEWED STUDY OF OF TFA IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE IT'S BEEN CITED MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED TIMES WE EXAMINE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS TOPIC TFA TEACHERS COMPARED TO OTHERS. IN A LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS SETTINGS -- WE FOUND THE TFA TEACHERS DID NOT PERFORM BETTER THAN CERTIFIED IN TRAIN TEACHERS IN MY WORK AS A FACULTY FELLOW FOR THE NATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY CENTER. I'VE PROBABLY READ IT EVERY SINGLE STUDY AND TEACH FOR AMERICA AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WHILE MOST STUDIES DON'T SHOW A POSITIVE EFFECT OF TEACHER AMERICA. THE STUDIES THEY DO FIND A POSITIVE EFFECT TYPICALLY DON'T FIND IN EFFECT UNTIL THE FOURTH AND FIFTH YEARS AND PRIMARILY ONLY IN MATH. BUT BECAUSE 85% OF TO GIVE ME A TEACHERS ARE GONE BY THE FOURTH AND FIFTH YEARS I THINK YOU HAVE% TO PUT A BIG ASTERIX BY THOSE FINDINGS. WE SHOULD CAN LOOK AND AND RE ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THOSE FINDINGS. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SAY THE TFA IS NOT THE NEW CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS THEY HAVE CLAIMED IN THE PAST MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME SHOW ME WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE. AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHO YOU ARE. I THINK IT'S NOTABLE THAT THE CALIFORNIA AND DOUBLE ACP LOU ACT OUR NATION'S LARGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. FOR THE MORE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS REPRESENTED BY SEE IF T. ARE ALSO SUPPORTING THIS BILL IN CONCLUSION. THE CALIFORNIA POLICE BE IN THE NETWORK FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION SUPPORT PARENTS IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO DESIRE A HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHER FOR EVERY SINGLE STUDENT. IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS THANK YOU. MY NAME IS THERE MIGHT CITY I WAS A TEACH FOR AMERICA CORPS MEMBER IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK PUBLISHED BY PETER LANG. FOR THE STUDY I SURVEYED AN INTERVIEW TWENTY SIX OF MY FELLOW CORPS MEMBERS IN THE GREATER PHILADELPHIA REGION. THREE SURVEYS INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED OVER TWO YEARS THESE TWENTY SIX TEACH FOR AMERICA CORPS MEMBERS SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES WHICH COLLECTIVELY PROBLEM TIES TEACH FOR AMERICA'S APPROACH. TEACH FOR AMERICA TO YOUR ALTERNATE A TEACHER CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON RECRUITING. GRADUATES FROM ELITE YOU NEVER CITIES TO TEACH PRIMARILY POOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. TEACH FOR AMERICA'S FOUNDERS STATED THAT THERE IS QUOTE NOTHING ELUSIVE ABOUT SUCCESSFUL TEACHING PEOPLE SIMPLY NEED TO WORK HARD AND BE DISCIPLINED AND QUOTE. IN CONTRAST MANY TEACH FOR AMERICA CORPS MEMBERS WORKING VERY HARDAND WERE SEEKING TO CARE FOR OTHERS. BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE CORE OR COMMONLY SELF DESCRIBED WITH THE WORDS SHAME FAILURE AND ISOLATING. WITH LIMITED TEACHER TRAINING AND AS THEY WERE BEING PLACED IN UNDER RESOURCE SCHOOLS CORPS MEMBERS REPORTED EXPERIENCING NEW LEVELS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY. FATIGUE DEPRESSION TRAUMA PTSD AS DIAGNOSED BY THEIR LICENSED THERAPISTS. DURING THEIR TWO YEAR TEACH FOR AMERICA SERVICE COMMITMENT. COR MEMBERS ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO SERVE STUDENTS BUT NOT ONLY DID MANY CORPS MEMBERS IN MY STUDY STRUGGLE AND LEAVE THE CLASSROOM AFTER THEIR TWO YEAR COMMITMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUCCESSFUL BY TEACH FOR AMERICA STANDARDS IT'S NOT AN ACTING SYSTEMIC CHANGE. IN OUR WORK TOWARD EDUCATIONAL EQUITY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HOLD OURSELVES TO PROVIDING STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES THE SAME EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES OPPORTUNITIES AND FULLY PREPARED TEACHERS THERE DEMANDED FOR STUDENTS FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. AB TWO TO ONE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN THIS DIRECTION THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS AMBER CAM I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT AND I HAVE A PHD IN EDUCATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER MY JOB IS PREPARING TEACHERS TO TEACH IN URBAN. AND HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS. I AM ALSO A TF A CORE MEMBER FROM ATLANTA. TWO THOUSAND ONE I JOIN TO BE A BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS ORGANIZATION THAT RECRUITED QUALITY -- SKILLED TEACHERS TO TEACH IN HIGH NEED SCHOOLS -- WHEN I MATRICULATED TO TFA I HAD A BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S DEGREE IN TEACHING AND THREE YEARS OF TEACHING EXPERIENCE? I WAS NOT THE TYPICAL T. AFFAIR I WAS PREPARED I WAS EXPERIENCED SADLY MY FELLOW CORE MEMBERS WERE NOT. MOST HAVE NEVER TAUGHT OR EVEN TAKEN ONE TEACHING CLASS. FIVE WEEKS OF TRAINING IN A BIT OF SUMMER SCHOOL WAS NOT ENOUGH AND SUDDENLY THEY WERE PLACED IN SCHOOLS. SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE MARGINALIZED STUDENTS IN OUR COUNTRY. IT WAS LIKE WATCHING UNTRAINED PILOTS WITH ONLY FIVE WEEKS OF FLYING EXPERIENCE -- TO TRY TO TAKE OFF AND KEEP THE PLANE IN THE AIR. THEY BECAME FRUSTRATED DEPRESSED ANXIOUS ANGRY IN A FEW DID WELL THAT'S TRUE. SOME LEFT AND 40% LEFT BY -- BY THE END OF THEIR TWO YEAR COMMITMENT 85% WERE STILL TEACHING ONLY 85% LEFT AFTER THEIR FIVE FIFTY YEAR -- IN THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN I KNOW BECAUSE I TEACH. CORE MEMBERS RIGHT NOW AS A PROFESSOR -- SOME SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY AMAZING BUT MOST LEAVE DISILLUSIONED AND IN THEIR PLACE ARE HOLES FEELING OF ABANDONMENT AND DESTABILIZATION OF COMMUNITIES. WHAT'S MORE IS TO BASED ON A REALLY GOOD JOB OF COMMUTING OF RECRUITING DIVERSITY LIKE ME FOR EXAMPLE I COME FROM A WORKING CLASS AND POOR COMMUNITY -- AND I'M THE FIRST MY FAMILY GO TO COLLEGE AND THEY RECRUIT PEOPLE LIKE ME PEOPLE OF COLOR. BUT BY PLACING UNPREPARED MARGINALIZED TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOLS THEY'RE BURNING OUT OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE TEACHERS OF COLOR AND FOR MOST OF THE PRODUCTS THAT IT SAYS THESE ARE THE ONES THAT LOOK LIKE AND SOUND LIKE OUR KIDS. I UNDERSTAND WE NEED TEACHERS BUT WE NEED PEOPLE IN CLASSROOMS WE BELIEVE IN KIDS POTENTIAL WE ALSO NEED TO FIND WAYS TO PREPARE LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF EDUCATION JUSTICE. BUT TFA IN PROGRAMS LIKE IT ARE A BANDAID THEY DON'T PROVIDE LONG TERM STABILITY. IN FACT IF WE GOT DO SOME DIGGING WE SEE TO HAVE A HOUSE COSTS THAT OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS. BUT AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BANDAIDS THE WHOLE THE WOMAN'S TOGETHER WE WILL NEVER GO TO THE DOCTOR HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE DEEPER INFECTION. I ASKED TODAY THAT YOU ALLOW THE CHIU DISALLOW UNDERPREPARED TEACHERS TO EDUCATE OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT RON WRAPPING THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND SUPPORT. SEPTEMBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. WE'RE EAGER TO SEE THOSE IN PRINT -- BUT CERTAINLY SOUND LIKE SOMETHING WE COULD SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEE NO THERE'S A SUPPORT -- THE OPPOSITION YOU MAY PROCEED. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL VICE CHAIRMAN KILEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ASHLEY CAN PLAN I'M A SIX YEAR TEACHER TEACHING AT ALLEN AT SIGN BACK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA -- TO BE HONEST I'D RATHER BE WITH MY CLASSROOM TODAY BUT I AM HERE ON THE PATH MY STUDENTS -- I AM HERE TO ASK YOU TO OPPOSE AN ILL ADVISED BILL. EIGHTY TWO TO ONE IS BAD FOR STUDENTS BAD FOR SANTA FE AND BAD FOR CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I WAS A SECOND YEAR CORPS MEMBERS LISTED HERE SOUNDS AIMED. AT MANSON MIDDLE SCHOOL. I KNEW I WANTED TO BE A CLASSROOM TEACHER. NTFA OFFERED ME THE CLEAREST PATH TO BECOMING A TEACHER IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR YEAR OF GRAD SCHOOL OR MOVE CROSS COUNTRY. BUT BECAUSE OF CAFE I WAS ABLE TO JUMP RIGHT INTO TEACHING AND STAY ASK WHAT I LOVE. TO WITHOUT TFA I WOULD BE A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER TODAY. THROUGH GRANTS TO HAVE A GAVE ME THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PAY FOR A DEPOSIT ON AN APARTMENT. IN FOR MY CREDENTIALS WITHOUT IT I WENT HAVE AFFORDED TO TEACH IN SAN JOSE. THIS IS THE POWER OF TFA IT OPENS DOORS FOR DIVERSE PASSIONATE SMART PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BECOME TEACHERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. THIS MAKES OUR SCHOOLS BETTER. I AM HONORED AND HUMBLED TO SAY THAT I WAS NAY MY SCHOOL'S TEACHER OF THE YEAR THIS YEAR. AND THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF TO GET A SUPPORT. SOME OF THE BEST TEACHERS I'VE EVER MET I TF A LAMB INCLUDING MY MENTOR VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES A TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WHEN I SANCHEZ. THIS IS WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE DOWN AB. TWO TO ONE TINA FEY STRENGTHENS OUR SCHOOLS MY COMMUNITY OF SAN JOSE AND DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE PRINCIPLES AND COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE AWAY THIS LOCAL CONTROL? AND MORE TO THE POINT WHY WOULD YOU TAKE TEACHERS LIKE ME OUT OF AYE DISTRICTS CLASSROOMS AND AWAY FROM OUR STUDENTS. PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB TWO TO ONE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TARA DONALDSON MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR THEM ON THE LIST AND I'M ACTUALLY A PROFESSOR AT LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. I'M AN IMMIGRANT FROM THE PHILIPPINES AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. IN A CALIFORNIA BILINGUAL TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND AFTER TALKING DALY CITY AND SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE MOVING TO ALL OF YOU. ALLEN YOU HAS BEEN A PARTNER WITH VARIOUS DISTRICTS INCLUDE AND PARTLY TINGLING TEACHER AMERICA. AND THEREFORE I STRONGLY OPPOSE OPPOSE AB TWO TWO ONE WHICH WOULD BAN TFA CORE MEMBERS FROM TEACHING IN THE SCHOOLS THAT NEED THEM THE MOST. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME OF A TEACHER SHORTAGE. ALLEN WEST COLLABORATED WITH TFA FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND WE PARTNER WITH BARS DISTRICTS INCLUDING SENT LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO STOCKTON OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE. OUR PARTNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE MOST RIGOROUS OF THE EIGHTY INTERN PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. WE ARE ACCREDITED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IN FACT WE JUST FINISH THIS A VERY SUCCESSFUL SITE VISIT YESTERDAY. THE FAA PROVIDES FURTHER SUPPORT TO ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE KNOW THAT THIS COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WORKS. BECAUSE OUR TFA SCANNED CANDIDATES LAST YEAR SCORED ABOVE THE STATE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ON THE NTP A WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENTLY ADMINISTERED PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. THE FAA ALSO ALLOWS THE TEACHING FORCE TO BE MORE DIVERSIFIED. IDENTIFIES PEOPLE OF COLOR COMPARED 238%. NTFA TEACHERS ALL TO TEACH IN HIGH NEED AREAS LIKE STEM SPECIAL EDUCATION IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION. ACTUALLY BECAUSE IF THE FAA OUR STUDENTS ACTUALLY GET TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THEIR TEACHERS. I WITNESSED THEIR GREAT TO NASA THE INDICATION. THE BAND THE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THE FAA CORPS MEMBERS WITH EACH ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE A MAJOR FINANCIAL BURDEN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND A LOSS FOR THEIR STUDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. FURTHERMORE THE BILL FAILED STOP KNOWLEDGE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THEIR WORK. INSTEAD WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND WELCOME THE SCORE MEMBERS INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEXT WITNESS. IN OPPOSITION THAT.

TO TO THE CLASSROOM RIGHT. HE WANTED YOU WANTING TO THE ANA AMENDMENT REALIZE JUST REGRET I THINK PEOPLE SAYING YOU WANT TO LEARN ANY TEACH FOR AMERICA -- THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL SAYS WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IT SAYS THAT YOU. ARE GOING TO ENTER INTO A FIVE YEAR. MA'AM -- AND WERE YOU AND SO MY GOAL IS TO KEEP TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHING. AND IN CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO DESIRE TO BE. THERE FOR A LONG FOR OVER A LONGER TIME HER TAKING ALL THE NECESSARY SKILLS. AND MAYBE PAY BACK THAT INVESTMENT THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD BE MAKING ON THEM OKAY THANK YOU -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS MISS SMITH. AM I THINK THE OTHER FOR THE TIME AND CONSIDERATION THAT SHE HAS PUT INTO THIS MEASURE AND WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY -- DEEP CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT AND THE INTENT BEHIND IT IS REALLY WHAT I APPRECIATE THE MOST BECAUSE IT'S TWO FOLD IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS AND IN OUR MOST ACADEMIC ACADEMICALLY CHALLENGING SCHOOLS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEING CONSIDERATE ABOUT WHAT BEST SUPPORTS TEACHERS IN THAT EARLY INDUCTION PHASE OF THEIR CAREER. AND SO WHILE I ATE I RESPECTFULLY HERE THE OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH -- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS WHICH I THINK GETS IT BETTER ON A TRACK TO THE THE GOALS THAT WE'VE BOTH TALKED ABOUT. AND I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY IN IN SO FAR AS I WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT I'D LIKE TO BE WORKING ON THE INDUCTION SIDE AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT -- BUT ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S DOING BEST FOR KIDS WHO NEED IT. AND SUPPORTING EARLY CAREER TEACHERS AND PUTTING THEM ON A PATH WHERE THEY CAN HAVE. CLASSROOM SUCCESS AND A SUSTAINABLE CAREER WE WE WANT TO KEEP YOUNG AMBITIOUS TEACHERS IN OUR CLASSROOMS SO AND I APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. ANY OTHERS -- MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SUMMER GARCIA AND AND TO EVERYONE THAT'S COME OUT ON ON ON BOTH SIDES ON THIS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE IT. THE AUTHOR PROBABLY PAT OF THE CONVERSATION SOUNDS A SIMILAR TO THE SERIOUSNESS I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU'RE REALLY. TRYING TO TALK. TO ALL OF US TO REALLY GET A SENSE OF OF WHAT YOUR GOALS AND INTENTIONS ARE I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFF I I KNOW THAT -- MY STAFF AND A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH SOME LOCAL FOLKS LOCAL DISTRICTS. TO REALLY KIND OF WRAP OF TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. ON THIS TO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT COME TO MIND ONE IS -- THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE ONE LOW INCOME SCHOOLS WE DON'T BUNDLE COMES WITH THE SAME DEGREE FUND SCHOOLS ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IS A LARGER ISSUE THAT IMPACTS EVERY ASPECT OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND THAT BEING SAID I I I DO APPRECIATE THE ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHAT INDUSTRY YOU AND IF YOU HAVE INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS WHAT HAVE YOU THE GOAL SHOULD BE THAT. I MEAN I WAS IN TURN PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I BIG BECAUSE I WANT TO COME IN I DID BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THAT. ULTIMATELY THAT INTERNSHIP TYPE PROGRAMS THE PURPOSE SHOULD BE AS WE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW. THAT YOUR PENSION COME TEACHERS RIGHT I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE IDEA IS TO FIND DIFFERENT. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A IN ISSUE WITH ATTRACTING BECAUSE GOING TO TEACHING ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE SO LIKE. TALK ABOUT I CAN SOUNDS A WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. AND SO WE WANT TO FIND WAYS TO GET PEOPLE. TO GET INTO THE PROFESSION AND UP OF ENTRY POINTS WHERE THEY'VE HOPEFULLY STAY IN THE PROFESSION AND SO I APPRECIATE -- THE THE INTENTION THERE PARTICULARLY WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A LONG A COMMITMENT I THINK THAT THAT. MATTER WHAT PROGRAM IT IS WHETHER COMING FROM THE CSU INTERNSHIP PROGRAM MORE A THIRD PARTY PROGRAM THAT THAT LONGER COMMITMENT I THINK WILL REALLY. YOU KNOW WE GET OUT FOLKS THAT ARE THAT THAT REALLY WANT TO MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO BECOMING A TEACHER -- AND THE THE ONE THING I DO WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE THIS IS A CAN A AND IT IS SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT TALK TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT -- IS. THE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT CERTAINLY IS THE SHORT TERM IMPACTS. OF PROHIBITING -- TEACHING AT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. I HAVE SOME DISTRICTS I THINK PROBABLY A MANY OF US DO THAT ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. SO. YOU KNOW WHAT. ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE A GOAL THAT I THINK WE ALL MAKE. CAN AGREE AND AGREE ON THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PREPARING. IN TERMS OF ANY FORM TO BECOME GOOD QUALITY TEACHERS THAT STAY IN THOSE DISTRICTS. THE SHORT TERM PRAGMATIC REALITY IS THAT I HAVE SOME DISTRICT ALUM ROCK IS ONE UP THAT HAS ABOUT 10%. THAT -- ARE THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS USE THIRD PARTY TYPE PROGRAMS AND TING. A CHALLENGE TO TRY. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NEGOTIATE THAT IN IN A ONE OR TWO YEAR PERIOD -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- IS. YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL WERE TO GET THROUGH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. UP OUR AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AGAIN YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS THE NUMBER OF US ARE. THAT IS THE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE SOMETHING CONVERSATIONS ON JUST. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE OF FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE IN SOME OF THE DISTRICTS AND AND MY COMMUNITY I I DON'T. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY SCHOOLS PERFORM POORLY. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ADDRESS A LOT OF THEM AND I THINK THAT. CREATING THAT LONG TERM PIPELINE IS ABSOLUTELY A CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. AGAIN WITH OTHER COMING THROUGH A CSU INTERNSHIP WITH THEIR COMING THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IN SHIP YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THEY STAY THERE AND THE LADY LOVE TEACHING AND THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT JUST FIVE YEARS BUT HOPEFULLY. TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT ENERGY TO HOW WE GET THERE AND SO I WOULD LOVE. THE OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY GET A COMMITMENT THAT WE CAN KEEP TALKING ON HOW WE ENSURE. THAT. THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING A LEASE SHORT TERM TRAUMA FOR SOME OF THE DISTRICTS BUT INTENTIONALLY. THAT IF WE DO GET A LONGER TERM COMMITMENT FROM ORGANIZATIONS -- THAT MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE A PATH TO ALLOWING SOME THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION IF THERE'S AGAIN PARAMETERS IN PLACE THAT ENSURE. THAT IT'S REALLY BEING DONE TO CREATE A PIPELINE. FOR FUTURE TEACHING I I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE. I WILL SAY THAT WE OPPOSITION -- FOLKS WHO ARE HERE ARE OUR TEACHER OF THE YEAR WE WANT THAT PIPELINE SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME COMMON GROUND. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TEACHERS STAY IN THE CLASSROOM PASSED THAT PROFICIENCY IN TH OF IT TAKES TWO TO THREE YEARS TO BECOME PROFICIENT ON AVERAGE. THE VIEW IN RECENT YEARS BEYOND THAT FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO THIS -- I IF WE HAVE TEACHERS LIKE YOURSELF WE HAVE TO JUST LIKE MYSELF THAT. WE FIGURED IT OUT AND WE STAY THERE RIGHT I STAY THERE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY INTENTION TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AFTER THIS CASE UP -- AND AND SO WE CAN DEFINITELY HAVE THAT EXAMPLES BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY. ARE US AND WE'RE NOT THE EXCEPTION WHICH IS AT THE DATA SHOWING US RIGHT NOW IT'S I THINK WE HAVE THAT. IN COMMON I THINK I'M ONLY TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH EVERYONE I THINK MY PLAINTIFF OF THIS BILL EVEN PARADIS IS STARTED DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. WHEN WE IDENTIFY SCHOOLS HAD A ONE WAY SEEN THESE KIDS FROM THE BEGINNING HAVE ALL THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AGAINST THEM? DOES THIS ADD TO THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AND IF SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE RATIFY FOR SOME OF THAT AND AND EVEN MORE SO WITH THEIR SPECIAL AT US SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND NEEDS. AN ALLEY YOU IS THE ALL OF OUR TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS ONLY TEACHING SPECIAL EVENTS ARE MOST ONE OF THE STUDENTS OF COLOR SPECIAL THAT -- YOU KNOW AND SO AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION THIS TRAUMA WHEN YOU HAVE THIS CONSTANT CYCLE EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS PEOPLE LEAVING THERE'S A TRAUMA THAT HAPPENS TO THE STUDENTS ARE THE TRAUMA HAPPENS IS GOING TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING I'M PRAGMATIC I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO ENGAGE ON A TIME LINE THAT MAKES SENE THAT MIGHT BE FAIR. TO TO ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS TO COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS I'M BEING PRAGMATIC AND I'M OPEN THAT THE OTHER SET IS OPEN. TO SOME OF THESE A MOMENT THAT WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN FROM THE COMMITEE CHAIR TO DAY -- AND SO. I I WILL CONTINUE AS I THINK I HAVE RIVER THE MULTIPLE YEARS HERE TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT WHERE MAYBE AT THEN IT AT THE END WE ALL GET SOMETHING WHEN I WE HAVE A GOOD BILL. I I AND I APPRECIATE THAT OF A SUMMER GARCIA SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE REASON WHY THERE'S BEEN THAT THIS IN DEPTH CONVERSATION WITH A NUMBER OF US BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET THERE WITH THE ON YOUR INTENTION. WITHOUT CAUSING TO MUCH ISSUE WITH THE PRAGMATIC APPLICATION OF IT AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. RUNNING THESE INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY OKAY WELL IT THIS IS DIRECTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY SOME TO GO WITH EVEN WITH THESE AMENDMENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF TRY TO COME TOGETHER SAY THAT THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT STILL NEED. THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH TEACHERS THE DAY ONE TO COME INTO THOSE CLASSROOMS IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A MORE ROBUST PROGRAM. THAT PUTS THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS WHICH IS REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT CAN WE CREATE A MORE ROBUST PROGRAM THAT HAS A LONGER TERM COMMITMENT. AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT WERE NOT AT LEAST IN THE VERY SHORT TERM DISADVANTAGING THESE SCHOOLS THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF REASONS FOR IT ARE RELYING ON ON THIS SHORT TERM INTERNSHIP -- TO BUILD THEIR CLASSROOMS AND SO. THAT'S AND I AND I I I I WILL SAY. THERE DISADVANTAGED WITH OR WITHOUT THIS PART ACTUALLY -- AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SHORT TERM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GET TO ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WE'RE SAYING STILL STAYING. AWAY WE HAVEN'T REALLY FIX THE TEACHER SHORTAGE PROBLEM ARE WE HAVING GIVEN OUR TEACHERS ENOUGH SUPPORT THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING IN THIS DISCUSSION THE COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE LEADERS HERE HAVE BEEN PART OF THOSE SOLUTIONS FOR FOR MANY YEARS SINCE IS ONCE. ADDITIONAL LAYER TO THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN HAD -- ENTERTAIN HERE AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT DISCUSSES THE DO CONTINUE ON BOTH SIDES -- IT'S Y. TOOK SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE -- IT'S WHY I GUESS HAVE MULTIPLE COMMITTEES TO GO THROUGH AND AND PART OF THAT PROCESS AND SEND THE SAME WAY THAT I'VE TAKEN FROM SUBSTANTIVE A AMENDMENTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE I WANTED TO COMMIT TO ANY ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT I HAVE COMMITMENT FROM. THE OTHER SIDE THAT SOME OF THESE AMENDMENTS AND SOME OF THE ACTION IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I'VE MONSTER I THINK THE LONGER TERM COMMITMENT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY A PIPELINE I THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD AGREE. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WERE SOME OF THE THIRD PARTY FOLKSY. TO COME TO THE TABLE BUT WITH YOU AND WITH OTHERS UP EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND SAY OKAY WHILE. THIS IS THE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BUY INTO BUT IT WILL WORK WITH US IF AB AND SEE. IF THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN HAPPEN THEY NEED TO HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT. THIS BILL GOING FORWARD I THINK I IMAGINE WILL URGE ON THOSE. CONVERSATIONS BUT YOU KNOW. FOR YOU KNOW I A AND SO I AGREE WITH THE INTENTION I AGREE WITH THE CREATING A LONG TERM PIPELINE A REAL PIPELINE FOR LONG TERM SUCCESS OF CREATING MORE TEACHERS. AND FOR MY CONTINUED. SO I SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE COOKING COMMITMENTS YOU'VE MADE IN CONVERSATION AS WELL AS THIS AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO COME BOARD AS WELL AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND IF THINGS PROGRESS IN A WAY THAT CERTAINLY I FEEL COMFORTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY DISTRICTS. A BOOK OR OR YOU WILL CONTROL THE SHORTER DRAMA. YET WE'RE DEALING WITH A LONG TERM TRAUMA AT THE SAME TIME THEN I ABLE. YOU'LL LIKELY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT RIGHT NOW I WANT TO VOTE FOR IT -- BUT WHEN IT GETS THE FLOOR I THINK A LOT OF THOUGHT OF THINGS A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS FROM ALL SIDES NEED TO HAPPEN AND I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT LOUD AND CLEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AT A FEW. QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A COMPLICATED TOUGH ISSUES ARE TAKING THE MOST AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS BILL OF ALL THE BILLS TODAY THERE'S A BIG LINE OUT THERE. I THINK THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT THAT THAT -- WERE THAT TERROR ADDRESSES THAT ONE WE HAVE THIS REAL TEACHER SHORTAGE I KNOW EVERY YEAR. IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE RE OVERSEAS SCHOOL FUNDING. WHEN THAT COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMES AND GIVES THE RIVER THERE UPDATE ON THE NUMBER OF? EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL TEACHERS I THINK IT'S RELATIVELY STABLE I THINK IT'S THOUSANDS RIGHT SIX THOUSAND SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND SO THAT'S REAL ON THOSE ARE KIDS THAT ARE IN CLASSROOMS WITH TEACHERS THAT ARE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED THEY SOME OF THEM HAVE SUBSTITUTES FOR DAY ON DAY IN DAY IN DAY [inaudible] ON ON MONTHS AND SO. AND THEN THE SO WE KNOW ABOUT THE TEACHERS WERE IS OBVIOUS YOU ARE NOT COMPENSATING TEACHERS ENOUGH. IT'S HARD TO BE A TEACHER. AND STRESSFUL POSITION MR O'DONNELL REMINDS US ALL THE TIME -- YEAH. AND THE THE THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT -- IN SOME OF THESE HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. IT'S JUST TOUGH FOR THE KIDS AT THE THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THEM. IN THEIR IN THEIR HOME. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. HEALTHCARE JUST THEIR LIGHTS AND THEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOLS WITHOUT ADEQUATELY -- TRAIN TEACHERS AND AND THOSE ARE THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. THE THIS ISSUE AND SO I I UNDERSTAND -- WHERE YOU'RE GETTING AT AND SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE THOSE ISSUES SO I I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I THINK THERE ARE SOME FLAWS AMID TALK ABOUT A SECOND I DO HAVE A FEW? A FEW QUESTIONS IS -- I JUST I JUST. I WAS REMINDED TODAY THAT MY NIECE WAS IT TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHER AFTER GRADUATING FROM SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. AND SHE DID IT FOR A YEAR AND THEN SHE DIDN'T DIDN'T PAN OUT. SO SHE'S DOING GREAT ANOTHER PROFESSION AND SO. BUT THAT'S A LOT JUST TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE IT'S A TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS DID IT THEIR OTHER TEACHERS THAT TEACH FOR A YEAR AND LEAVE AS WELL. SO I WANT TO ASK YOU AND AND YOU THE PROPONENTS AND TEACH FOR AMERICA. IT DO WE THINK THAT. TEACHERS IN TEACH FOR AMERICA ARE ARE ARE MORE WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS ONE EIGHT YOU CAN REVIEW THIS WE WANT. TO IF THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE WITHIN THE FIRST FEW YEARS THAN TEACHERS IN THE TRADITIONAL -- TEACHER TRAINING PROCESS SO ALL OF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT WE WILL. WELL -- OUR DATA T DOESN'T SHOW THAT TO BE TRUE. IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULAR WE SHOW THAT. WELL EMPTY SEVEN ABOUT 35% OR TEACHERS. REMAIN IN THE CLASSROOM BUT ANOTHER 3235% MOVE ON IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER. CAREERS IN EDUCATION SO A LOT OF THEM ARE MOVING INTO ROLES AS YOU KNOW SYSTEM PRINCIPLE DEAN'S MOVING TO CHARTER SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS AND SO. WE START TO SEE THEM TAKING ON LEADERSHIP ROLES AND SO. YOU'RE ON THE SUPPORT SIDE THE BILL OR YOUR TEACHER AMERICA YES THAT'S RIGHT YOU'RE SITTING OVER THERE WITH US. I'M SORRY THIS IS WITH THE WITH THE SEATING AVAILABLE THAT'S ALRIGHT I JUST GOT LOOKING. COMMON GROUND I JUST GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED AS WANT TO CLARIFY THANK YOU. YEAH THEY'RE GONNA ANSWER. I HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT -- AFTER THEIR FIFTH YEAR ONLY TWENTY SEVEN POINT 8% OF TEACH FOR AMERICA CORPS MEMBERS WERE STILL TEACHING. TEACHING NOT JUST IN EDUCATION BUT ACTUALLY TEACHING COMPARED TO THE FIFTIES 50% ESTIMATED FOR NEW TEACHERS ACROSS ALL TYPE OF SCHOOLS. SO. ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS IT'S 50% AFTER FIVE YEARS AND TO ONLY TWENTY SEVEN POINT 8% STILL TEACHING. IF YOU'RE A CORE MEMBER CORRECTED AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT YOU SAID EARLIER IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM YOUR EXPLANATION SO. HE THAT'S THE POINT OF THE AMENDMENT THE YOU'RE PROPOSING IN THERE SOME TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW WE WOULD ENFORCE THAT THAT. FIVE YEAR COMMITMENT. AND WE'RE NOT THE LANGUAGE AND IN FRONT OF US HERE SO HOW WOULD THAT STRUCTURALLY WORK. WELL. CURRENTLY IF YOU HAVE A TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHER AT YOUR SCHOOL SITE YOU HAVE A MEMO OF UNDERSTANDING -- THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO FOR THE TWO YEAR. COMMITMENT AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK ON THE FIVE YEAR AND WILL YOU AND THE SAME WAY THEY FIGURED OUT A TWO YEAR AND WHAT YOU BUT HOW DO WE ENFORCE THAT. WE GO TO THE DOCTOR. CLAW BACK. MONEY SOME OUT HOW HOW WOULD THAT WORK I KNOW LIKE IN THE MILITARY OUT TO SERVE CERTAIN MY YEARS YOU SOME HAPPENED SO IT HOW WOULD THIS WORK FOR THE FOR THIS. BUT I CAN SURE AS AS CONTEMPLATED FROM THE COMMITTEE STANDPOINT -- THAT WOULD BE BUILT INTO AN AMMO YOU AND IF YOU VIOLATED ANNA YOU THERE WOULD BE. CERTAIN CONDITIONS -- CERTAIN MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO I THINK WHEN WHEN. WHEN TFA OR WHATEVER ORGANIZATIONS ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS A PLACE PLACE TEACHERS IN IN IN IN IN SCHOOLS ACROSS UNITED STATES? THAT THEY WOULDN'T THE TICKET WHAT THEY DO OF MINORS AS GIVE A BONUS FOR EACH YEAR EACH OF THE TWO YEARS. RIGHT SO I I WOULD I WOULD HOPE I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD CONTEMPLATE THAT IS THIS A BUILDING THERE BONUS STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR THIS FOR BEFORE YOU ALTERNATELY RECEIVE. SOME TYPE OF BONUS I DON'T WANT TO DESIGN IT HERE BUT I I THINK THERE VARIETY OF FRONTS WHERE YOU TO DRESS THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. YEAH THAT'S I WOULD THINK WE HAVE THE APPLE PROGRAM THE LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR YOU GET AN AWARD BASED ACCOUNT. BASED UPON EVERY YEAR. THAT YOU TEACH BUT IS IS THE EMMA USE IT IT IS IT BASED UPON. MULTIPLE TEACHERS FOR DISTRICT OR IS IT. IS A PER INDIVIDUAL I I WOULD THINK WOULD BE I THINK YOU MIGHT DISTRICT PROBABLY SET UP AND I WILL YOU WITH AN ORGANIZATION. AND PROBABLY THERE'LL BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CANDIDATES PROBABLY KAPPA PROBABLY WITH. A DEFINED NUMBER I ASSUME YEAH. AND THEN TOO I I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU TO TEACH FOR AMERICA REPRESENTS -- ONE TO TO RESPONSE TO THE THEN THE NOTION THAT UP IN LA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH I FIND SHOCKING MAYBE COULD POLITENESS. IS AT ALL OR THE MAJORITY OF YOUR TFA TEACHERS TEACH SPECIAL ED. AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO I'VE HEARD THAT. THEY'RE ALL IN IN INDEPENDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS WAS WONDERING IF THAT'S A STRUCTURE THAT YOU FIND EASIER TO GO INTO AND AND AND WHY IS THAT SO. NOW THE TWO SEPARATE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES SUFFERS THE LAUSD WAS STATED BY THE BY THE AUTHORED OTHERS THAT. OF THE IN LA U. S. T. ALL OF THEIR NOT ALL SPECIALTY DESSERT TFA OF COURSE BUT ALL OF THE TFA TEACHERS. END UP TEACHING SPECIAL ED. THE ANSWER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] YEAH -- I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION LA STM LYDA FROM EXACTED RECTOR FROM TEACH FOR AMERICA LOS ANGELES THEY'RE NOT ONLY SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND ALL YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE STEM TEACHERS AS WELL. AND THEN -- BUILDING WAS BUILT JUST SO YOU KNOW THE L. L. A. U. S. T. DID INFORM THE COMMITTEE THAT ALL THEIR TFA TEACHERS ARE SPECIALISTS. AS DIRECT INFORMATION TO THE YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID SOME NOT ALL SPECIALIST BECAUSE OF COURSE TFA BUT THEY WE COULD PROVIDE OLD IDEATION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT -- EIGHT FIRST YEAR STEM TEACHERS WITH ELLIE S. T. RIGHT NOW AND THEN. OKAY THANK YOU. I WOULD SAY THAT PART OF IT IS AS WE'RE TRYING TO COLLECT DATA OUT THERE'S NOT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TRACKING ALL THIS INFORMATION SO IT'S ALSO BEEN. A CHALLENGE AT TIMES AND WE HAVE COMPETING SEVEN INFORMATION BUT ALLEY ESTATE THEMSELVES TOLD US. THAT THEIR TFA PLACEMENTS WERE DOING SPECIAL AT THE REPS RIGHT BEHIND THE THINKING WAS TO SAY SOMETHING [inaudible] OF STATE. IN THE GARAGE WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ON WE DO HAVE -- IN THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. FOR TFA AND FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER SUBJECT AREAS OF C. T. HE WOULD BE ONE OF THEM AS WELL. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE STILL WORKING FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR YEAH [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] HI. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH -- WITH WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS IS IS THAT MORE OF A RELATIONSHIP THAT TFA FINDS. WORKABLE LEAVE DID YOU FIND MORE INDEPENDENT CHARTERS ARE WELCOMING. TFA THAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS I KNOW LIKE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE TFA MY UNDERSTANDING THEY'RE NOT THROUGH. THE NINE CHARTERS THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THEY'RE ONLY THROUGH. THE INDEPENDENT CHARTERS IN THEIR SACRAMENTO SCHOOL DISTRICT. WELL I THINK WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PLACEMENT STRATEGY SENSE OUR GOAL IS TO SERVE THE NEEDIEST COMMUNITIES AND THE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE RATHER THERE IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS -- WE FEEL THAT WE CAN BENEFIT THEM SO WE GO -- WHEREVER THERE ARE PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PREFERENCE IN TERMS OF CHARTER VERSUS THAT TRADITIONAL PUBLIC JUST. BASED ON WHAT THE LOCAL NEED AND AND EASE OF ENTRY OUR OKAY. THAT IS SOMEBODY WHO DISPLACEMENT YES OKAY SO I ALSO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS IN CHARTERS AND SOME COOL SAY -- IN WE DO PLACE IN BOTH IN THE HIGHEST NEEDS MOST OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WE PLACE IN HAVE MORE SCHOOLS THAN THE CHARTER SCHOOL SO IT'S PRETTY EVEN THAT IS THE GOAL. TO SERVE ALL OF THE COMMUNITY IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE EASY TO WORK WITH WE HAVE TONS OF DISTRICTS. ON THAT ARE EASY TO WORK WITH AND THAT ACTUALLY WANT MORE TEACHERS I WE CHEST IN SAMPLE SAT ALONE PASSED FOR AMMO USE FOR TEACH FOR AMERICA THIS YEAR IN THE PAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS. FIVE ZERO BECAUSE THEY SEE THE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM AND WE WANT LOCAL CONTROL RIGHT -- SO THANK YOU DEFINITELY EASY TO WORK WITH DISTRICTS THANK YOU. WAS RECORDED YEAH THANK YOU AND THEN MY LAST IS FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR AGAIN I I SUPPORT THIS TODAY I THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP SORTING OUT THE NINE I'M GLAD YOU TOOK THE FIRST STEP IN OVERALL. THANK THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CLARIFYING THIS IS A TYPE OF INDUCTION OF TEACHERS NOT NECESSARILY A BRAND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL -- BUT ALSO -- AS MISTER KALRA MENTIONED YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR SOME OF OUR SOME DISTRICTS ARE ALMOST ALL TITLE ONE AND THERE IS A VALUE IN IN THESE TYPE OF OF EFFORTS AND SO. YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY OF GOING FORWARD TO TO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE NONE IN TITLE ONE EVEN WITH A FIVE YEAR COMMITMENT BUT SOME TYPE OF LIKE A RATIO IS AT ALL UNDER CONSIDERATION. I DON'T KNOW THE TWO THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN THE FEASIBILITY OF A RATIO OR HOW WE TRACK THAT I MEAN YOU'RE ALREADY ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AND WE USE AND HOW WE KEEP THAT ACCOUNTABLE. AND SAYS THAT AT A LATER THAT KIND OF MAKES AN UNWORKABLE SO I'M NOT SAYING NO BUT IT IT IN THOSE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED AND FOR ME ALONG THE WAY. AND TO IF I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THAT PATHWAY I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE COULD THE FIVE YEAR COMMITMENT -- IS. IS IMPORTANT KEEPING THOSE DOLLARS IN THE SCHOOLS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARE PART OF THE SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TAKEN. TODAY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND SO I THINK AT THIS POINT IN THE DISCUSSION I CAN'T SAY NO TO ANYTHING -- BUT IF YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S RIGHT WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES AND AND IN DOING SO. ARE WE GETTING TO THE GOAL OF A WITH THE BILL. ONE AMPS DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU A DOCTOR YES I I I I APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION -- OBVIOUSLY IT BUT BRINGS TO OF FOR A NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND PLACEMENT OF TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT. YOU AND I OVER THE YEARS -- YEAH I THINK. IT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE TEACH FOR AMERICA'S BRAND IS OUT THERE AT THIS POINT AND SO I THINK THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT. NECESSARILY TO DEAL WITH THAT BUT TO DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF PLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN SCHOOLS AND I THINK OF THOSE OF YOU FROM IN DOUBLY C. P. AND OTHERS WHO HAVE THE RESEARCH KNOW. THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES AT MOST SCHOOLS HAVE SOMEONE HAVE GENERALLY THAT ARE -- LOW INCOME OF SCHOOLS TITLE ONE SCHOOLS IS SHE MENTALLY CHALLENGED SCHOOLS HAVE MOST OF THE NEW TEACHERS THE INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS WHETHER THERE. IS A BE FORTY FOUR AMERICA THIS IS DURING TEACH FOR AMERICA NO BE ACTED TEACH FOR AMERICA -- AND THAT'S THE ONGOING CHALLENGES THE PLACEMENT AND AS HAVING BEEN A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WITH THE AND NUMBER TITLE ONE SCHOOLS I SOMETIMES MUST DISTRICTS HAD MY SCHOOL INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS HAD AS HIGH AS 70%. BRAND NEW TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL. OF LOW INCOME KIDS WERE REALLY CHALLENGED AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S NOT ONLY THEIR THOSE TEACHERS ARE TRYING TO LEARN WITH THE BEST THAT THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER A AS AS AS NEW TEACHERS. BUT THERE'S NO THEY'RE VERY FROM ROLE MODELS AT THAT SCHOOL IN TERMS OF EXPERIENCED TEACHERS WHO CAN HELP WHERE ACROSS INTERSTATE EIGHT YOU KNOW THERE ARE HOLES THE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES WITH THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF YEARS IS TEN FIFTEEN YEARS IN SCHOOL. AND WHEN YOU BRING IN A NEW TEACHER THEY HAVE WON FIVE MENTORS TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT THE CURRICULUM DO CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT NEW TEACHERS STRUGGLE WITH. SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH IS IS REALLY THE ISSUE OF PLACEMENT. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- THAT WE OFTEN PUT OUR NEW AS OUR NEW TEACHERS NO MATTER HOW ENERGETIC THEY ARE THEY GOING TO CHILD THE CHALLENGE WITH MANAGING CURRICULUM AND CLASS MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND ISN'T TAKEN TWO THREE FOUR YEARS TO BECOME GOOD ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH IT IN THE IN THE MEANWHILE YOU'VE GOT KIDS SIGNALS CLASSROOMS WITH FOR YEARS. THE ONE CLASSROOM TO THE NEXT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF BRAND NEW TEACHERS AT THE SCHOOL WILL GOING TO BE THE VICTIMS OF WHATEVER HAPPENS NOT INTENTIONALLY. BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. EXPERIENCE TEACHERS IN THOSE SCHOOLS TO INTERVENE TO SUPPORT AS WELL AS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE IN THOSE CLASSES AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS IN A WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT IT I'M I'M. I I I'M CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE AND WILL WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE ISSUE OF CONTRACTING OUT CONTRACTING IT. IN MY MIND IT'S A MATTER OF PLACEMENT. AND A MATTER OF COMMITMENT -- AND I KNOW OVER THE YEARS I'VE I'VE BASICALLY SAID WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE A A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF NEW TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL LARGER THAN WHAT THE DISTRICT PASS. SO THE DISTRICT HAS 10% NEW TEACHERS THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN 10% NEW TEACHERS AT A POOR SCHOOL. BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AROUND AT THAT OF COURSE BRINGS HEARTBREAK TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE MAY BE MOVED FROM SCHOOL IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BUT YET THEY'RE VERY EXPERIENCE AND THEY NEED TO GO SOME PLACE TO HELP. OUT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON SO I THINK THIS IS THE GIVES TO ISSUE BUT WE WHAT KIND OF STARTING AROUND IT IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT. TEACH FOR AMERICA AND ALL THAT WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IN EXPERIENCED TEACHERS NOT HAVING THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE AFFECTED AND BEING SO MANY OF THEM IN ONE SCHOOL. THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT WITH IT BECAUSE IF YOU GOT TEACH FOR AMERICA IN THE AND THEN YOU IF YOU'RE A POOR SCHOOL YOU PROBABLY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE THAT ARE NOT TEACH FOR AMERICA. YOU CAN'T HAVE TO TEACH FOR AMERICA FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND SO WE HAVE THE SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT WOULD LARGE NUMBERS OF BRANDY TEACHERS. NOW WOULD NEVER BANNED BRENDA TEACHERS BECAUSE THEY BRING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM INTO A SCHOOL BUT SOMETIMES THE OTHERS DON'T BRING. BUT THEY ALSO NEED MORE THAN JUST INCLUDES THE AS MAY NEED TRAINING I MEAN IT'S SUPPORT ON HOW TO BECOME AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER AND SO -- I'M OF SUPPORT IS NOT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WHEN YOU'VE COMMITTED TO CARRYING ON THE THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS CRITICAL THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH BEARS OUT. THAT WE SHOULD BASICALLY BE DISTRIBUTING ARCS TEACHERS ACROSS THE BOARD WITH WITH XP BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIENCE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY TEACH THE STUDENTS HAVE SOME MENTORS SOME SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE OTHER KIND OF STRUCTURES THAT HELP PEOPLE BECOME. EFFECTIVE TEACHERS EVEN IN OUR OWN REGULAR TEACHER POOR WHEN WE HAD THE MEETING HERE TALKING ABOUT WHY ARE PEOPLE LEAVING THE PROFESSION. NUMBER ONE ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE REASONS ONE OF COURSE IT WAS IT ALL. MONEY AND SO FOR THIS ONE BUT ALSO THERE WAS AFFECTED PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL SUCCESSFUL. AND THEY PROBABLY DID FEEL SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PUT IN SITUATIONS THAT THEY FELT THEY WOULD NOT DOING THE BEST THEY COULD DO AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE PROBABLY WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY WERE DOING A GOOD JOB AND SO THEY LEFT THE PROFESSION SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BASICALLY MESSEL ANYMORE KIDS. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT SO I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU THE ISSUE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE THE REAL ISSUE WE HAVE HERE AND IT'S AN ISSUE A PLACEMENT. NEW TEACHERS IN TOO MANY NEW TEACHERS IN ONE SCHOOL AND THE INABILITY OFTEN TIME WITH THOSE SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT AND TO PROVIDE THE MECHANISMS AND THE AND THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS. TO HELP THOSE TEACHERS BECOME EFFECTIVE AND THAT IS FOR I TEACH FOR AMERICA THAT IS FOR ANY OTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE ONE ON AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE NEED TO BASICALLY FOCUS ON HELPING OUR TEACHERS BECOME EFFECTIVE. AND NOT PUTTING TOO MANY IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN HELP EACH OTHER. THANK YOU -- MISTER HASN'T. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA DO YOU. THINK THIS BILL VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. YOU WILL PROTECTION BECAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. TO THE QUESTION. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GET THIS QUESTION TO MYSELF DIRECTLY SO. HAVE A LOOK THAT EXAMINE MANASSEH QUESTION UNTIL THIS MOMENT OKAY HAVE YOU HAD ANYONE RAISE CONCERNS OF THE BILLS AND CONSTITUTIONAL [inaudible] OKAY. DO YOU THINK ABOUT VIOLATE THE CONTRACTS BECAUSE THE US CONSTITUTION. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A QUESTION FOR TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THOSE PROBABLY ON APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW SHE'S NOT A LAWYER WERE NOT ASK HER TO OPINE AS SUCH. AND I KNOW THE COMMITTEE VECES WITH A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COMMITTEE. WITHIN THE WITHIN THE BUILDING AND I THINK WE'RE PRETTY COMFORTABLE THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL. OKAY WELL I I DON'T ABOUT YOU MISTER CHAIR BETTER THAN -- WITH TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND UNITED STATES AND I GENERALLY TRY TO ABIDE BY THAT AND MAKE SURE THE MY BILLS -- PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. BUT I MOVE ON I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO THAT. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS SOME DISTRICTS -- HAVE TEACHERS DEPARTMENTS TEACH FOR AMERICA AND OTHERS DOWN IS THAT RIGHT. I AM AND IT'S NOT YOU I'M FIGHTING A COLD SO MY HEARING TO LIVE IT OFF CAN YOU REPEAT YOUR QUESTION SURE -- SO THERE'S SOME DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA THE PARTNER WITH TEACH FOR AMERICA AND OTHERS THAT DON'T IS THAT RIGHT CORRECT. OKAY. SO THE ONES TO DO IT THE ONES THAT DO -- PARTNERS TEACH FOR AMERICA NO ONE'S FORCING THEM TO DO IT IS THAT RIGHT. THEY VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE DEPARTMENT TEACH FOR AMERICA. OKAY -- I SEE THAT A A RANDOM SURVEY FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN SAID THAT A MAJORITY OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS WOULD HIRE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT. NO JUST RECENTLY PLEASE I JUST YOU KNOW TO HELP YOU APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE WITNESS IS NOT HOSTILE. YOU KNOW JUST. ASK YOU THE QUESTIONS WITH PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL -- MAYBE GET TO THE POINT THAT -- THAT YOU WANT ME TO CONSIDER. WELL NO I'M ASKING QUESTIONS AND PUTTING INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MISTER CHAIR THIS IS ONE THE MOST HOSTILE PIECES OF LEGISLATION I'VE SEEN. SINCE MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE SO I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE WITNESS THAT GET TO THE CORE MERITS OF THE LEGISLATION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. NOW DO YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WRONG THAT OVER A MAJORITY OF TEACHERS AND CAL OF PRINCIPLES IN CALIFORNIA CITY WOULD HIRE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS. THESE PRINCIPLES IN AMERICA'S IN THE THIRTY PRINTS. FEATURES CALIFORNIA PRINCIPLES ARE SAYING THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD QUESTION IN MY I DON'T KNOW THAT'S CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC OR OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CITY AND LOOK AT THEIR DATA AND ALSO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT I AGREE WITH THEIR THEIR METHODOLOGY AND SEND THAT. PART I CAN SPEAK IF I HAVE THE DATE AND FINING ME SURE I HAVE THAT MUCH TRAINING BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN AGREE THAT AT LEAST SOME PRINCIPLES -- HIGHER TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS LONG TERM CARE HIRING THE NUMBER AS EARLY AS OKAY SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK THAT WE IS. THE STATE GOVERNMENT NO BETTER WHAT'S BEST FOR THE SCHOOLS THAN THOSE SCHOOL LEADERS. YES THEY GOVERNMENT COSTLY PASSED LEGISLATION THAT TELLS PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING AS A BODY AS A WHOLE. OUT THERE AND SO PART OF WHAT WE DO IS DISCUSS IT AS THE BODY AND TRY TO COME TO A PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO OUR LEADERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON A REGULAR BASIS NOT JUST IN THE SPACE. SURE MAYBE OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION DO SIMILAR THINGS I'M ASKING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHY DO YOU THINK WE AS THE STATE GOVERNOR BETTER EQUIPPED. THAN SCHOOL LEADERS TO DETERMINE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE STUDENTS AT THEIR SCHOOLS. I'VE I'VE I WOULD SAY THAT. INSTANCE WHERE YOU'RE IN THE THICK OF THINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE TELEVISION AND WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. OKAY SO YOU THINK THAT THE SCHOOL LEADERS WHO DECIDE TO HIRE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS. ARE NOT MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THEIR SCHOOLS I THINK THE TEETH THE SCHOOL LEADERS WHO ARE. HIRING WHETHER TEACH FOR AMERICA OR OTHER INTERN TEACHERS WOULD ALL AGREE THAT WOULD THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE TEACHER THERE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. OKAY. WHICH IS PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PIPELINE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CLASSROOM. PASSED PROFICIENCY SO THAT ONCE THEY GET TO THAT LEVEL THEY'RE GIVING THAT SKILL SET BACK TO THE STUDENTS. OKAY SO IT BUT IN IN EACH AND EVERY INSTANCE WHERE SCHOOL LEADER IN CALIFORNIA HAS DECIDED TO PARTNER WITH TEACH FOR AMERICA AND HIGHER TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT I WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO [inaudible] YES [inaudible] OKAY. DO YOU AYE AYE AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION YOU BELIEVE THAT. THE TEACH FOR AMERICA TEACHERS BASED UPON THE TRAINING THEY RECEIVED ARE NOT. CAPABLE OF BEING AFFECTED TEACHERS IS THAT RIGHT. SOME OF THE MORE YOU HAVE A GREAT TEACHER HAIRFINITY HE'S BEEN TEAM TEACHER OF THE YEAR HER SCHOOL THIS YEAR CONGRATULATIONS ASHLEY. SO SOME OF THEM ARE BUT WE HAVE MANY OF THEM ARE NOT FINISHING EVEN THEIR TWO YEAR CONTRACT BECAUSE THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WANT. TO LEAVE A YEAR EARLIER BECAUSE IT WASN'T FOR THEM. OUT THERE AND SO IT'S NOT A 100% BUT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING OR LEAVING OR NOT STAYING IN THE PROFESSION. A LONGER THAN A COUPLE YEARS AND SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT KEEPING TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM AT THE AND THAT'S THAT'S MY GOAL HERE. OKAY ARE YOU AWARE THAT TEACH FOR AMERICA IS THE MOST DIVERSE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM AND PIPELINE IN THE STATE. I'M NOT HAVING THE MY MY ISSUES I TRYING TO ADDRESS SO THERE WE HAVE A DIVERSE WORKFORCE BUT WHETHER WE HAVE TEACHERS WITH EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM -- FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. OKAY MY QUESTION WAS ARE YOU AWARE THAT TEACH FOR AMERICA IS THE MOST DIVERSE PIPELINES. ONE OF LORENA. I'VE SEEN DATA THAT BERRIES -- DATA THAT TELLS ME THAT 51% OF TEACH FOR AMERICA OUR ARE CAUCASIAN. AND WAS CAR NUMBER LAST NIGHT. OUR AUTOMATIC REIMAGINE. THE CROSS EXAMINATION INTEREST FACTS THAT. THE SUMMER KILEY HAS STATE THOSE FACTS AND THEN ASK THE OPINION. AS OPPOSED TO DO YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW THIS YOU KNOW THAT SPEAKING OF THE BILL MISTER KILEY PLEASE SPEAK TO ASK. SPEAK TO THE PRESS YOU CLEARLY ALREADY KNOW. AND THEN IF YOU WANT SO HIM HER GARCIA TO COMMENT ON THEM SHE CAN COMMON. MISTER KALRA. WHEN I? WE CAN ACTUALLY HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON HERE OKAY. ONE PERSON SPEAKS AT A TIME MR KILEY YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED. TO CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING THE PLEASE MAKE IT. SPECIFIC TO THE BILL NOT STUDIES THAT THE THAT THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL CAN'T POSSIBLY BE AWARE OF OR CARRY AROUND IN HER HEAD. PLEASE KEEP THEM AGAIN RELEVANT TO THE BILL SO WE CAN GET THROUGH AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. SURE. SO I HAVE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME THAT SAYS THAT -- AND I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THAT THIS IS WRONG THE 60% TFA TEACHERS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR COMPARED 238%. OF THE GENERAL TEACHING POPULATION THAT'S ABOUT -- ONE AND A HALF PERCENT MORE -- ONE IN THREE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA IF THEY TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE -- IN LA OVER HALF OF TV TEACHERS ARE PROGRAM RECIPIENTS SO MY QUESTION. IS WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU THINK IT SENDS IF WE SINGLE OUT. THE SINGLE MOST DIVERSE PIPELINE. FOR TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SAY THAT THIS ONE ORGANIZATION AS YOUR BILL ACTUALLY DID BY NAME IN ITS FIRST ITERATION. WE WANT TO PREVENT YOU FROM AN OPERATING ARE. HOMELESS AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH YOU ASKING QUESTIONS BUT WHEN I'M NOT KIND OF CONTROL BUT IT -- COMES ALONG YOU DOING IS MAKING. ASSERTIONS THAT THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE I MEAN YOU GOT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE THE DATA SHE CAN SPEAK TO THE THE QUESTION. AND CITING STUDIES THE ENTIRE TIME WE SHE CAN SPEAK TO THE QUESTION N GENERAL PLEASE PROCEED. OUR INDIA THE CITY WE HAVE REFERENCE ARE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC -- AS OF AS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT WAS IN IN THAT VERSION ORIGINAL COLLEGE ATTENDEES WHO WALKED IN AS AS A TEACHER I SAID AS A TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND HAD THE BEST. VALUES AND WANTED TO DO THE BEST FOR THE STUDENTS TO LOOK JUST LIKE ME AND SO IMPACTED. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. HAVING THAT GOOD WILL IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT THE MESSAGE I'M SENDING THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED. MORE AND AND THEN I ALSO HOPE THAT ONCE WE INVESTING YOU YOU SAY THAT PASSED THAT TWO YEAR COMMITMENT IS WE NEED TO THEIR LONG TERM WE NEED TO BE THAT EXPERIENCE TEACHER THAT BECAUSE OR ROLE MODEL. AND THE MENTOR FOR THE FEATURES THAT ARE COMING BEHIND YOU. THANK YOU I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOME YOU SAID BEFORE YOU YOU SEEM TO SUGGEST YOU ARE AGAINST -- ANY SORT OF IN TURN CREDENTIAL IS THAT RIGHT. I AM NOT AND I HAD THE I AM TALKING AS THE BILL HERE SPEAKS AND SO ITS THIRD PARTY -- EMPLOYMENT TYPE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE NOW. COME TO THINK THAT THIS BILL I SEE SO WHY SHOULD WE CREATED DISTINCTION THOUGH -- BETWEEN INTERNAL CREDENTIALS FOR THIRD PARTY -- ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF INITIAL CREDENTIALS NOT BE OUT THERE. DATE THE THEMSELVES CREATED DISTINCTION WHEN THEY CHARTS THE SCHOOL'S AVERAGE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THESE PLACEMENTS -- TO BEGIN WITH I THINK THERE'S A FEW OTHER ITEMS THAT MAKE THEM DISTINCT OUT THERE AND AGAIN I THINK THE BILL SPEAKS THE TIME COMMITMENT. OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM AND ALSO TO THE FEES CHARGED TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THAT IS THAT IS THE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN I REALLY THAT SHE'S PRESENTED TODAY I'M NOT THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM. BUT THE SORT OF OKAY SO THAT THAT IS PART OF THE SEASON. THE FISCAL ACADEMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROGRAM HER CONCERNS OKAY AND I'M AGAIN ADDRESS MY QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL I IT THAT IS ONE OF THE PRONGS IS DEALING WITH -- THESE PLACEMENT FEES BUT ANOTHER PROBLEM DEAL SIMPLY WITH PARTNERING. WITH A THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION AND WITH PLACING FOLKS A TITLE ONE SCHOOL SO. WHY SHOULD WE DISTINGUISH -- YOU KNOW THOSE SORT OF ARRANGEMENTS -- FROM OTHER TYPES OF INTERN CREDENTIALS IF YOUR CONCERNS TEACHER PREPARATION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOSING THE TEACHERS THE QUICKEST AND THE FASTEST AT THE FASTEST RATE ALSO. I WANT. TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'LL WEBER BROUGHT UP YEAH AND IT SPEAKS TO YOUR CONCERN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AYE GARCIA THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE KIND OF MORE EXPERIENCED TEACHERS ANDIN SCHOOLS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO MIGHT -- SORRY A WAY FOR YOU. TO I UNDERSTAND AND I JUST GOT OVER A COLD MYSELF. SO I AM I AM I REPRESENTING YOUR YOUR VIEW CORRECTLY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE TEACHERS IN THESE -- YOU KNOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WITH MORE FORMAL STUDENT POPULATIONS YES. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WEBER BROUGHT OUT BY THE POINT THAT WE HAVE THESE -- PREFERENCES THAT ARE KIND OF A PRODUCT OF STATE LAW WHERE -- YOU KNOW MORE SENIOR TEACHERS ACTUALLY GET FIRST CHOICE OVER THE SCHOOLS THEY GO. TO ACTUALLY TO BE THAT THAT WOULD BE NEGOTIATED AT THE LOCAL DISTRICT LEVEL. THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT TYPE OF AGREEMENT WITH THE KURDS SO AGAIN I'M GIVING YOU KNOW I'LL LET ME FINISH LET ME FINISH IS A LISTEN WE'RE GONNA TALK FACTS HERE K.. NOT GONNA MAKE UP STUFF JUST THROW IT OUT THERE HOPE IT STICKS GAY THAT WOULD BE NEGOTIATED IN THE LOCAL DISTRICT MO YOU CONTRACT IT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT TO AN ANIMAL OF THE STATE -- NOT ACCURATE ACTUALLY THE STATE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY ACT REQUIRES THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING SO IT IS CUT OFF LET'S GO GET IT IS CORRECT THAT THAT IS TO GO SHE HATED -- AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A PROVISION RELATING TO CRESSMAN IS PRODUCT OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT CODE. SO -- THERE'VE BEEN A TIMES IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT PROVISION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD. TO CHANGE THE SORT OF A SENIORITY BUMPING SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED TEACHERS GIVEN PREFERENCE WHERE TO GO AND AND YOU KNOW MORE OFTEN THAN NOT GOING AWAY FROM THE LOW INCOME SCHOOL SO WOULD YOU. COMMIT TO AMENDING THE BILL -- TO TRY TO DO AWAY WITH THE SORT OF SENIORITY BUMPING PRACTICES TO GET YOUR CONCERN HAVING MORE EXPERIENCED TEACHERS LOW INCOME SCHOOLS [inaudible] NO [inaudible] OKAY. DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD NOT BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS CONCERN. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL AT THIS VERY MOMENT IN BRINGING LIGHT. I TO A PRACTICE THAT MIGHT INCLUDE THAT RELATE TO THAT -- DISCUSSION BUT I'M NOT GOING TO COMMIT TO COMPLETELY CHANGE HIM A BILL TO PLEASE -- YOU TODAY AT SENDING YOU AND I COULD DISCUSS AT A LATER TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE ABOUT ONE OTHER AREA SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT DIFFERENT STUDIES AND I KNOW BOTH SIDES PRESENT CONFLICTING ARE TO SOME EXTENT CONFLICTING -- DATA AS TO TEACHER PERFORMANCE DO WE HAVE ANY DATA AS FAR AS THE PERFORMANCE OF TSA BAY TEACHERS VERSES THE PERFORMANCE OF LONG TERM SUBSTITUTES. SO THE WINNER DRAWING HAMMOND STUDY FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE WE LOOK THAT AND NOT EASILY SUBSTITUTES BUT UNCERTIFIED TEACHERS WHO COULD BE IN THAT -- GROUP -- AND TFA PERFORM SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE AND CERTIFIED TEACHERS BUT NOT BETTER THAN THE CERTIFIED EXPERIENCED TEACHERS. BUT I THINK THE KEY THERE IS THAT. CHOOSING BATTLE WORSE IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD. OKAY BUT YEAH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE SORT OF ACCEPT WHAT IS MY IMPLICIT PROMISE -- THAT -- IF YOU YOU SIMPLY SAY WE CAN'T HAVE TFA ANYMORE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE LONG TERM SUBS PLACED IN SCHOOLS. THERE'S A STATE CAN HAVE MORE TFA. IS IS THAT YOUR OF YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR FIVE YEARS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHICH INCLUDES ORGANIZATIONS LIKE. TFA OUT THERE ARE THAT YOU THAT YOU WILL MAKE SURE YOU TRY TO IF THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A STATUS TO THEM AND THEY SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER SET OF STUDENTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO CLASS THE STUDENTS AND SO I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THAT'S WHAT THE BILL SAYS CORRECTED TO BE CLEAR -- THE AMENDMENTS DON'T BAN TFA. WITH A C. TO DO IS GET MORE EXPERIENCE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. OKAY MISTER I CAN JUST ASK ALSO THE WITNESS AS WELL BECAUSE YOU WOULD COMMENT ON THIS AYE IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION DO YOU THAT EXCEPT THAT -- IS THE RESULT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE THE PLACEMENT OF MORE LONG TERM SUBS AT LEAST IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHETHER LABOR MARKET A LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT. YOU KNOW -- MAYBE DISTRICTS WILL PAY TEACHERS MORE MAYBE WORKING CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE THERE'S I THINK TOO MANY VARIABLES TO MAKE THAT A SUNSET ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL DO YOU THINK THE BILL WOULD RESULT IN THE PLACEMENT OF MORE LONG TERM SUB SOMETHINGS ARE NEVER EQUAL. SO YOU'RE NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. SO. IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT YOU COULD SEE HIM IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA -- AT THAT WOULD GET YOU KNOW BASED UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF OF TFA TEACHES VERSUS NON TFA TEACHERS -- THAT WOULD CONVINCE YOU THIS BILL IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. AT THE MOMENT THERE HASN'T BEEN BUT YOU AND I CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON IN THE FUTURE I MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT. THE PARAMETERS OF THE DEBATE ARE SO IF WE WERE TO HAVE EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT. THE TEACHERS WERE FIRED AT ARMS. MEMBERS OF THE DEBATE ARE ON THE BILL. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED TO GET IS SOME ESOTERIC CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE TENANTS OF THE BILL. VOTE NO VOTE YES. BUT THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING IS CONTINUING ON FOREVER AND GETTING NO WHERE. WELL I I THINK IT'S PARTLY TO BLAME FOR THAT MISTER CHAIR SO I WILL WRAP UP MY QUESTIONING AT THIS POINT. I AND I WILL SAY JUST IN CLOSING THAT I ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE HAVE. SEVEN THOUSAND TFA ALARMS IN CALIFORNIA WHO KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS FAILING OUR KIDS AND THE DATA BEAR THAT OUT. THAT OUR KIDS IN LOW INCOME SCHOOLS -- GET A WORSE EDUCATION HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY TF ELEMENT ALUMS KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE AND THIS BILL. MAKES VERY CLEAR THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THAT WE HAVE A COMMITTEE HERE. AT THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS NOT FOCUSED ON KIDS AND IT OPERATES AS A DEFAULT MODE OF PASTA POLICY MAKING IS ANTI STUDENT ANTI TEACHER AND ACT ANTI I FORTY AND THERE IS A MOVEMENT TO CHANGE THAT. TEACH FOR AMERICA IS A BIG PART OF THAT MOVEMENT AND I THINK THIS BILL MIGHT GET PAST THIS COMMITTEE DON'T A DANIELLE WILL NOT PASS. AND I THINK IT WILL GO OUT. IF YOU DON'T. EVERY. MR KILEY YOU DON'T NEED THE L. TO MAKE YOUR POINT [inaudible] PLEASE CONTINUE. AND I THINK THAT WE WILL THAT THAT YOU'RE GONNA HELP US TO GALVANIZE THIS MOVEMENT TO ENSURE THAT YES ONE DAY EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- BEFORE THE OTHER CLOSES I JUST WANT TO SAY AS A TEACHER IN A TITLE ONE SCHOOL I WANT SOMEONE TEACHING NEXT DOOR TO ME THAT IS DEDICATED TO THE PROFESSION. NOT SIMPLY TRYING TO BUILD A RESUME IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND MY CONCERN WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TFA I LISTEN I I THINK IT'S VERY NOBLE HELP SUPPORT TEACHERS GET IN THE CLASSROOM. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A COMMITMENT TO KIDS AND A COMMITMENT TO THE PROFESSION THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN COMES WITH WITH YOUR EFFORTS THUS FAR BUT EXTENDING OUT THE TIME COMMITMENT FROM THE ORGANIZATION. AND ALSO THOSE PEOPLE PLACED IN A CLASSROOM I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE THING. FOR KIDS IT'S A POSITIVE THING FOR THE PROFESSION IN FACT IT SAYS TEACHING IS A PROFESSION. IMAGINE IF WE SAID WELL YOU'LL BE A PARAMEDIC FOR TWO YEARS YOU CAN START TODAY. AND THEN IN TWO YEARS YOU CAN MOVE ON TO GOING TO GRAD SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING. THEY'RE USING THIS AS A RESUME BUILDER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GO ON TO SOME HE LIED GRAD SCHOOL OR LAW SCHOOL -- AND I WONDER IF WE'RE NOT JUST. FEELING A POT HOLE WITH TFN. AS OPPOSED TO RE PAVING THE STREET RIGHT WHAT IS OUR PROMISE BEEN MENTION OF HEREBY EVERYBODY EVERYBODY THAT ARE PROBLEMS GETTING EXPERIENCED TEACHERS IN THESE TITLE ONE SCHOOLS IN FACT IN ALL SCHOOLS RIGHT. AND WE NEED TO WORK AS A COMMITTEE AS A BODY AS A LEGISLATURE. TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT LISTEN I HAVE LIVED THIS MORE THAN ANYONE ON THIS DíAS. OKAY I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCED TEACHERS AT A SCHOOL SITE. IT IS DANGEROUS IT IS NOT SAFE OKAY THEN WE MOVE ON TO THE ACADEMICS EXPERIENCES SO WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON THAT IN THAT ROOM AND WHAT ABOUT THE MID NINETIES WHEN WE STARTED THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION. NEWBIES WERE COMING ESPECIALLY. AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL LIKE THAT RIGHT. RIGHT NOW THAT SLOW DOWN OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE THE PIPELINE INCREASED AND AND THINGS CHANGED -- BUT I'M WORRIED THAT WE'RE HEADIN BACK IN. TO THAT ERA SO THIS COMMITTEE THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE AGAIN NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT SPEAKS. THE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU CLOSE YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CLOSE -- ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I THINK WE HAVE BEEN GALVANIZED SOUTH THAT BODY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND TODAY'S DISCUSSION ON BOTH SIDES -- MOVES THAT THIS MOVE THIS FORWARD CLOSER. TO TO REALLY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM -- AND ARE WE AND ARE WE REALLY COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS ARE JUST ELAINE AND PROLONGING AND DOING MORE FOR THE SERVICES SIT INS FOR ANOTHER GENERATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTE. THANK YOU -- THE MOTION IS -- WE NEED A MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH WHAT IS THEIR AUTHOR THERE MISS GARCIA. A JOB UNDER QUESTIONING THEIR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NO KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE SMITH SMITH I WEBER. WEBER AYE. YOU GOES FIVE OH TO DESIGN. IS THE MYSTERY OF US WHERE ARE YOU. WAKE UP. YEAH I SAW YOU SITTING OUT THERE. I KNOW TOMORROW SHE'S GOING TO COME OUT THREE ON THE FLOOR AND ASKED TO BE ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE [inaudible] MAYBE NOT. OUR WITH THAT MYSTERY WAS IS GOING TO PRESENT -- AT SHE HAS TWO BILLS WHEN WE START WITH AB ONE ONE SIX IF WE CAN IF WE MAY. SIXTEEN AB SO AB SIXTEEN ARE YOU OKAY STARTING WITH AB SIXTEEN OR ALL OF YOUR GOT IF YOU GOT EVERYBODY UP THERE LET'S JUST DO A DO YOU ARE THEY WHAT YOU WANNA DO YOU TELL ME. LET'S GO THOUGH. SO I THINK LET'S. TWENTY TWO EIGHTY TWO YES AB ONE EIGHTY TWO IS. GOING TO BE FIRST AB ONE EIGHTY TWO AND THAT'S FILE ITEM TWO OR THREE I'M NOT SURE WHICH THREE FIVE NINE THREE YEAH OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- THEY MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR CONSIDERING THIS MEASURE. I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP TO EVALUATE THE NEED FOR A SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THE CHAIR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO ME THAT I'LL BE ALLOWED TO BRING A SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL BILL BEFORE THE FULL COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION NEXT YEAR -- PASS THE LEGISLATION TO DEVELOP A COMPUTER SCIENCE SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIAL IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE CD. TO CONVENE AS A RESULT OF AB -- TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE BY FORMER ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- SCHISM MONIA WHICH IS HERE TODAY WITH ME -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA IS A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY LEADER THE INDUSTRY STILL CANNOT MEET ITS LABOR DEMANDSWITH OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OPEN COMPUTING JOBS WITH AN AVERAGE SALARY ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. DESPITE 93% OF PARENTS WANTING THEIR CHILD TO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE ONLY 35% OF SCHOOLS OFFER A COURSE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONLY 25% OF SCHOOLS -- OFFER IT IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE -- EXPANDING COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IS ALSO AN ISSUE OF EQUITY. OF THE 1-000-020-0404 CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO TOOK THE AP COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN ONLY 27% WERE FEMALE ONLY 14% FOR LATINO AND JUST ONE POINT 4% WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN. THAT IS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO CHANGE IN OAK PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME THAT ARE FROM COMMUNITIES LIKE ME ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW I TOOK. MY FIRST COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE AND I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE YEARS FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TO BE. ACCESSIBLE ON TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ON'T SO CURRENTLY TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE A TEACHER MUST EITHER BE CREDENTIALED IN MATH. BUSINESS OR INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION OR RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORIZATION -- A DEDICATED CREDENTIAL IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WOULD ATTRACT TEACHERS WHO MAY BE TURNED OFF FROM THE PERCENT PROFESSION BY THIS ROUND ABOUT PATHWAY TO AUTHORIZATION AND YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME. WHO WOULD? OF NOT ENTER OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD -- N. OR LEAVE THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD TO BECOME A COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHER AND YOU KNOW I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. THAT WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I COME FROM A STEM BACKGROUND -- MOST OF MY NETWORK AND FRIENDS ARE IN STEM PROFESSIONS -- AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BUILT THEIR RESUME AND NOW WANT TO GIVE BACK TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BY TEACHING -- COMPUTER SCIENCE SO -- YOU KNOW I JUST I THINK. FOR WITH A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT OF TECH PROFESSIONALS -- THAT THERE ARE A LOT THAT DO WANT TO ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION. SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR ALEXIS HER AGAIN FROM C¡ DOT ORG AND FORMER ASSEMBLYWOMAN SUSAN BOCHNIA WHO AUTHORED THE BILL THAT CREATED THE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. FOR THESE REASONS REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON AB ONE EIGHTY TWO AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ALEXIS MINAKATA HERE AGAIN. I'M A CO DOT ORG C DOT ORG IS A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO EXPANDING ACCESS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS AND INCREASING PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE WE THINK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. WE HAVE SEEN A RECORD NUMBER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE BILLS INTRODUCED AT THIS YEAR AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS ALSO MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO EXPAND ACCESS. THE ADOPTION OF THE K. TWELVE COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS AND THE SOON TO BE ADOPTED CS. STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE CHAMPIONS KNOW THAT HAVING A FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OPENS DOORS. AB ONE EIGHTY TWO WILL CREATE A CLEAR PATHWAY FOR FUTURE COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. THE EXISTING SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORIZATION FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE ALLOWS TEACHERS TO TEACH CS BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT TEACHERS WHO MAY WANT TO TEACH CS AS THEIR PRIMARY SUBJECT. INSTEAD OF A FUTURE COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATOR MUST OBTAIN A SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL IN ANOTHER SUBJECT AND THEN SPENT EXTRA TIME AND MONEY. OUTSIDE OF THEIR CREDENTIALING PROGRAM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL COURSEWORK IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO OFFER TEACHERS MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO TEACH CS IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. THIS BILL CREATES A SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT WOULD TARGET TEACHERS WHO WANT TO TEACH THE S. AS THEIR PRIMARY SUBJECT AREA. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT EXIST AT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. THE CREATION OF A SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO CREATE. CS CREDENTIALING PRORAMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SUSAN BONY AND HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY REPRESENTING A NONPROFIT READY NATION OF BUSINESS LEADERS. WHO CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT A COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM? I'M JUST A FEW POINTS I WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE IS THAT -- TEACHERS GO INTO THE PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PASSION THEY ARE NOT IN IT FOR THE MONEY. AND SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A CREDENTIAL I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THOSE FUTURE TEACHERS THAT HAVE A PASSION FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE MAYBE NOT FOR THOSE OTHER SUBJECTS. AND THAT THEY WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT DEDICATED COURSE OF TEACHER PREPARATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE -- I YOU KNOW YOU CAN I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU CAN JUST TEACH ANY SUBJECT THAT MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF EDUCATION BUT ACTUALLY THE SKILL OF TEACHING. IS UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT AND SO CERTAINLY NOT ONLY CAN WE CAPTURE THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT PASSION BUT THEN WE HOPE TO ENCOURAGE OUR UNIVERSITIES TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP DEDICATED. COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- THIS MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR AND MIGHT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WHERE COMPUTER SCIENTIST MAYBE ARE TRACKED INTO A DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL TOGETHER BUT COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION MAJORS WANT TO GO AND HELP OTHERS UNDERSTAND -- THE INTRICACIES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THEN UP FINALLY -- WE ARE ALSO HOPING THERE WOULD BE AN EXAM THAT WOULD THEN HAPPENED WITH THE NEW CREDENTIAL CURRENTLY THERE IS NO SEE SAID EXAM EVERY OTHER -- ONE OF OUR SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALS REQUIRES THIS THE EXAM THEY TAKE IS FOR INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY WHICH DOES NOT HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE ON IT BUT IT DOES HAVE A QUESTION ASKING YOU HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE. SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT -- TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION EXPANDING THE PROFESSION AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE HIGH QUALITY -- TEACHING THAT HAPPENS AND I REALLY COMMEND THOSE TEACHERS OF THE FIRST ADOPTERS WHO ARE GOING OUT AND GETTING THAT SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORIZATION. MY CONCERN IS AROUND EQUITY WHAT ABOUT THE DISTRICTS WHERE THERE ISN'T ONE OF THOSE REALLY GO GETTER TEACHERS THAT'S WILLING TO PUT IN THAT EXTRA TIME. FOR THE EXTRA TRAINING I THINK THIS IS A STATE WIDE INTEREST TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL ACROSS THE THE STATE IN YEARS TO COME THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE A CREDENTIAL COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHER AVAILABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP WITH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DONNA ARE TWO CABBAGE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IN SUPPORT. SHANNON PRIMER EDUCATIONAL PARALEGAL MY HUSBAND'S WATCHING AND SAN DIEGO WERE BOTH IN SUPPORT.

A COMMAND OF THE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER A SUSAN BORNEO WHO WE WORKED WITH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO CREATE THE PANEL. AND THE DAY AND WE WERE SO HAPPY THAT WE HAD EIGHT TEACHERS ON THAT PANEL AND SOME OF THEM TAUGHT A P. COMPUTER SCIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL OR IN ELEMENTARY SO. IT WAS A VERY VIBRANT PIANO AND YOUR YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THE DRAFT PLAN HAS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH ANYWAY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE ARE NOT ONLY GOING TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO A SUPPORT THE BILL.

THIS IS LAW HER PRESIDENT DISSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WE TOO ARE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND IT WILL BE ASKING FOR SUPPORT.

THANK YOU -- ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SEEN OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK I JUST WANNA -- THANK YOU WAS REVERSE FOR YOUR PATIO VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN WELL DISPLAYED TO ME.

HE SAID THAT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS SOME PROCESS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO THAT THIS YEAR. AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL GET THAT WORKING GROUP TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE BY THE START OF NEXT YEAR BECAUSE IF NOT YOUR COME BACK WITH A BILL. RIGHT I KNOW THAT -- YOU SHARED THAT WITH ME AND I JUST WANNA THANK AS A FORMER SELLING A RUNNING FOR HER THIS IS THE FRUITION OF SOME OF YOUR WORK FOR SURE. AND YOUR PASSION SO THANK YOU I JUST THINK ON THE MORE IMMEDIATE -- FOR THE MORE. IS SHORT TERM. TAKE A LOOK AT THERE'S A BILL THAT I HAVE AND AND I MISS A QUIRK SILVA HAS IT SPEAKS TO A MORE EVERY IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THIS NEED. WHICH IS TO CREATE MORE SUPPLEMENTALS AND AND WHY THAT -- BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IT'S MORE MEDIA BUT ALSO NUMBER TWO IT'S SOME SCHOOL SITES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE NUMBER STUDENTS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT. THAT -- YOU KNOW COMPUTER SCIENCE ONLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS SO THAT'S A DYNAMIC I JUST WANT YOU TO BE WELL AWARE OF THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE WHERE AXIS COMING FROM I CAN'T SAY I YOU KNOW I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I THERE'S SOME ADMINISTRATIVE. REALITIES HERE TO WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE JUST PARTICULAR -- CREDENTIALS SO -- SO WITH THAT -- ANY OTHER FOR MANY MANY. THE BILL'S EMOTIVE SECOND -- THEM. DO YOU DO YOU DO EXCEPT BE THE THE EMINENCE.

TWO ONE FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO YOU MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE. OF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL -- AB SIXTEEN ESTABLISHES A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACH THAT WILL GIVE THE STATE THE ABILITY TO BETTER HELP COMMUNITIES. VIED SERVICES TO HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HOMELESS COORDINATORS AND BY FUNDING THREE GEOGRAPHIC COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. TO DEVELOP TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS. IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY AT MY OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 24% OF THE STUDENTS WERE CONSIDERED HOMELESS -- LAST SCHOOL YEAR THE HIGHEST RATED ANY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN LOS ANGELES -- THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE YOUR CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED A RISE IN STUDENTS EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO INCREASE -- IN RESOURCES PARTICULARLY IN CD EASE FUNDING TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. AB SIXTEEN WILL ENSURE THAT THE CD AND DISTRICTS HAVE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ASSIST OUR HOMELESS CHILDREN. AND COORDINATE BETWEEN OUR EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL HOMELESS EDUCATION PROGRAMS. I'M EXCITED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY COOLEY UNCLE HAVE US DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT CD SALT. TURN IT OVER TO HIM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS AND OF COURSE COMMITTEE STAFF -- THANK WELL AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND.

WHO AT ONE POINT DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR MET THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS REPRESENTING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT? OF THE TOTAL STUDENT POPULATION. THIS IS A 21% INCREASE OVER THE THEIR WORKS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS IDENTIFIED. AB SIXTEEN WOULD PROVIDE RESOURCES TO BUILD CAPACITY AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO BETTER HELP DISTRICTS IDENTIFY STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ENSURE THAT THESE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE RESOURCES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OUR HOMELESS -- HOMELESS COORDINATORS AND WE'LL FIND THREE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE. ARE HOMELESS COORDINATORS HELP IMPLEMENT THE MCKINNEY VENTO HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT WHICH REQUIRES ALL DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT A HOMELESS CHILD. OR YOUTH HAS ACCESS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION INCLUDING PUBLIC PRESCHOOL EDUCATION. THE FEDERAL MCKINNEY VENTO PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT THE STATE'S AWARD FUNDS TO ELEAZAR ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS OUR DATA INDICATES THAT TWO TOUSAND SIXTEEN ONLY -- SIXTY ONE OF THE ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THIS PROGRAM OR ROUGHLY 6% OF ELEAZAR IN THE STATE. BY INCREASING RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT IT WILL DRASTICALLY IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO ASSIST DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO FIND THREE ADDITIONAL STATE COORDINATORS TO MONITOR AND ASSIST ALL. THIRTEEN HUNDRED DISTRICT HOMELESS STUDENT LATE LIAISONS. ESTABLISHED THREE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND OTHER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. PROVIDE TARGETED TA TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND INCREASED TRAINING AND SUPPORT FOR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HOMELESS STUDENTS. AB SIXTEEN WILL ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ASSIST DISTRICTS AND IDENTIFY HOMELESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND ENSURE THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING ALL THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES.

YOU MAY RECEIVE ALREADY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF. FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FIFTY TWO IS SPONSORED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AUTHORIZES THE SUPERINTENDENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. TO REVIEW CONTENT STANDARDS AND GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ON UPDATES TO THOSE STANDARDS SHOULD UPDATES BE NECESSARY. CONTENTS CONTENT STANDARDS DIRECT THE CONSTRUCTION OF CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL THAT TEACHES THE TEACHERS USE IN THE CLASSROOM ON ANY GIVEN SUBJECT MATTER HOWEVER IN THE PAST LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS STATED THAT THE S. B. E. DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO CHANGE ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARDS FOLLOWING THEIR ADOPTION AND TO DO SO REQUIRES AN ACT OF LEGISLATION -- BY ESTABLISHING A PURSE PROCESS FOR THE PERIODIC REVIEW AND UPDATING OF STATE CONTENT SANDERS AB EIGHT FIFTY TWO INTEREST CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE BETTER PREPARED. FOR LIFE BEYOND KHI THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND OUR PRINT PRESENT WITH THE MOST RELEVANT INFORMATION WHEN LEARNING A SUBJECT WITH THAT AND I'LL MOVE TO MIGHT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO LINK WITH US WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF THIS THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND SPONSOR OF AB FIFTY TWO IN SUPPORT -- YOU KNOW THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS ADOPTED ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARD IN A VARIETY OF SUBJECT AREAS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED. TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS MATHEMATICS SCIENCE VISUAL PERFORMING ARTS PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TEN THE STATE ADOPTED A NEW ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARDS AND CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS THAT INCLUDE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER CONTENT AREAS IN WHICH STANDARDS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OVER TWENTY YEARS. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OUR WORLD IS CHANGED. NEW LAWS HAVE BEEN ENACTED THE IMPACT IN THE CONTENT BEING TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS HAVE ENTERED INTO A CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PROCESS IN PLACE TO REGULARLY UP THE EXISTING ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARDS EXCEPT THE LEGISLATION THAT AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT TO DO SO ON A SUBJECT BY SUBJECT BASIS. GIVEN HOW QUICKLY OUR SOCIETY AND TECHNOLOGY ARE CHANGING IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STATE STANDARDS KEEP UP [inaudible] I PROCESS. FOR REGULARLY UPDATING THE STANDARD SHOULD BE DOES -- DESIGNATED OR DESIGNED TO EMPHASIZE PUBLIC ACCESS AND ENGAGEMENT A RELIANCE ON SCHOLARSHIP AND CURRENT AND CONFIRMED RESEARCH ALIGNMENT TO CURRENT STATUTE. AND THE MINIMAL DESTRUCTION TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS USING CURRICULA AND ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THOSE STANDARDS. THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM IS BETTER SERVED BY STANDARDS THAT REFLECT THE CURRENT LAWS. MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING BUSINESS AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND ENABLE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO PLACE THE CONTENT INTO CONTEXT. THE STANDARDS ARE THE WHAT IN EDUCATION WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD KNOW AND BE ABLE TO DO BY THE END OF THE YEAR OR IN IN ANY PARTICULAR CONTENT AREA. CALIFORNIA PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND PARENTS TO THE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS THEY GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW THOSE STANDARDS MAY BE TAUGHT. WHEN THE STANDARDS ARE NOT CURRENT THE FRAMEWORK MUST PROVIDE INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE THAT WHILE REFLECTING CURRENT STATUTES? MAY NOT REFLECT OLD STANDARDS. TO KEEP IT SHORT BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE A LONG LIST OF BILLS TO STILL GO THROUGH. I WOULD SUMMARIZE YOU GOT IT IN THE DISPARITY IN THE CURRENT LAW IS AN OLDER STANDARDS HAS CAUSED CONFUSION FOR TEACHERS. AND ARE WORKING HARD EVERY DAY TO ENSURE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION AND SCHOLARSHIP -- I DO HAVE WITH ME TODAY ARE DIRECTOR OF OUR CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION DR STEPHANIE GRACE IS TO HELP AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU.

HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SHARON PRIMER FROM EMPOWER FAMILIES CALIFORNIA AND CHRISTY SUPPORT THAT APPROACH IT FROM EDUCATE ADVOCATE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE I AM CHRISTIE'S OF OVER THE BRIDGE IT. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE. EDUCATE ADVOCATE SERVICE FAMILIES THAT HAVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. SHANNON AND I ARE MOTHERS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS AND BOTH OF OUR SONS USE COMMUNICATION DEVICES TO COMMUNICATE. WE BECAME AWARE OF AN ISSUE THAT MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ARE FACING AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE HOME FROM SCHOOL THEIR COMMUNICATION DEVICE. THIS AND IN SOME CASES WITH AFTER SCHOOL IN GENERAL OR SOMETIMES ON SCHOOL BREAKS AND HOLIDAYS. MY SON SPEECH THERAPIST AT SCHOOLS THAT IT PASSED HER QUOTE IS WHAT IF YOU DISCOVERED YOUR CHILD IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN FRENCH. WOULD YOU IMMEDIATELY INVEST IN A FRENCH TUTOR CLASSES OR RESENT US DOWN OF COURSE YOU WOULD. IN THE SAME WAY ALL PARENTS AND FAMILIES WANT AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN OUR CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE. WHICH IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN WHO USE COMMUNICATION DEVICES THIS IS THEIR LANGUAGE. PARENTS AND FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO BECOME PROFICIENT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE IF THEIR CHILD IS AN ABLE TO BRING THEIR DEVICE HOME AFTER SCHOOL OR ON BREAKS AND HOLIDAYS. WE'VE SENT A FEW VIDEO CLIPS DEMONSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF USING COMMUNICATION DEVICE AT HOME AND IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE HOPE IT IMPRESSES UPON YOU THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF A STUDENT HAVING CONTINUED ACCESS TO THEIR COMMUNICATION DEVICE. THANK YOU AND WE ASK FOR YOUR I'VE LOW VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMPLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS SHANNON PRIMER.

THE THEM HOME EVERY DAY THE FAMILIES I WORK FOR ALL WORKING TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHEN OUR STUDENTS ARE DENIED THEIR VOICES THEY LOSE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL STUDENTS TO BE TAXPAYERS. ENABLING THEM TO ACCESS THEIR ENVIRONMENT MAKES THEM HAVE A GREATER CHANCE TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE WHEN A STUDENT LEAVES A DISTRICT OR AGENTS OUT OF A PROGRAM. THIS DOES NOT PRECLUDE THEIR NEED FOR A VOICE. WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE FAMILIES A FEW MONTHS TO FIND A GENERIC RESOURCE TO GET COMMUNICATION DEVICES REPLACED WE RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR HELP TO PROVIDE THAT ACT THAT ACCESS.

ONE THEY ARE SKILLS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IF NOT ESSENTIAL TO LIVE IS PRODUCTIVE INDEPENDENT ADULTS AND TWO THEY ARE PRIMARILY LEARNED BY SIGHTED CHILDREN. THROUGH VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THEIR PEERS OR OTHER ADULTS AND THEREFORE THE NEED TO LEARN THE SKILLS OF US ARE BLIND CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN THE SKILLS AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION. SEVEN AND LET ME GO THROUGH JUST A FEW OF THESE SKILLS FOR YOU. ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY WHICH YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT A MINUTE. COMPENSATORY ACADEMIC SKILLS SUCH AS CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT LEARNING TO USE BRAILLE AND LARGE PRINT AND OTHERS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO ACCESS THE CORE CURRICULUM IN THE CLASSROOM.

THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE DISTRICTS DO NOT PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE HOME OR COMMUNITY. EVEN THOUGH THE STATE'S PLAINLY AN IDEA TWO THOUSAND FOUR THAT ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY SERVICES ARE. TO BE PROVIDED IN THE HOME SCHOOLING COMMUNITY. WHEN I HAVE QUESTION THEM AS TO WHY THEY ARE NOT UPHOLDING THE IDEA TWO THOUSAND FOUR LAW? I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS THE DISTRICT POLICY NOT TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. I WAS APPALLED THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD WILLINGLY DISREGARD IDEA. TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND HINDER THE ONEM SPECIALIST FROM DOING THEIR JOB. OTHER COLLEAGUES HAD TOLD ME PERSONALLY THAT THERE DISTRICTS OF SAID THEY CANNOT PROVIDE SERVICES OFF CAMPUS. WILL NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO DESTINATIONS FOR LEARNING ST TRAVELER LIGHTED CROSSINGS. IN BUSINESS AREAS OR ALLOW THEM TO TEACH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SKILLS.

TO I BELIEVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TIMES A DAY IS WHAT I'VE HEARD WITH OUR INDIVIDUAL DEVICES IF YOU TRACKED THAT IT'S KIND OF SCARY BUT WE ARE USING TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT OUR DAY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE -- KILL -- IS AS UP TO DATE IN AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE SO THIS WOULD PREPARE AND ENCOURAGE STUDENTS AT AN EARLIER AGE TO PURSUE -- NOT ONLY A COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY BUT IT. ADDITIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TYPICALLY TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS -- MAKING SURE THAT WE GO BEYOND DIGITAL LITERACY COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WOULD PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS TO SUCCEED AND YET. ALSO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE COURSES AVAILABLE FOR THIS AB FOURTEEN TEN WOULD GOVERN GROW AWARDING GRANTS TO SUPPORT TEACHERS IN ENTERTAINING A COMPUTER SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION IN THIS IS REALLY A KEY PART. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY TEACHERS HAVE EVOLVED IN LEARNING TO USE TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE GROWING UP WITH THAT BUT WE HAVE NOT OFFERED A COMPUTER SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION AND I KNOW IN THE HIRING OF TEACHERS. AND MORE AND MORE THESE ARE THE TYPE OF SKILLS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS HAVE BUT IF THEY GO THE EXTRA STEP MIKE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO A SCHOOL -- WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE AND LIKE TO ASK THEM TO JOIN US. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON -- ALEXIS WHEN I GOT HERE AGAIN AGAIN WITH CO DOT ORG AB JOBS REQUIRING A BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AMONG THE HIGHEST PAYING YET ONLY 32% OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS TEACH CS. WITH RURAL LOW INCOME BLACK AND LATINOS. BEING THE LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE COURSES AVAILABLE TO THEM THE GREATEST BARRIERS SCHOOLS HAVE TO OFFERING CS IS THE LACK OF TEACHERS TRAINED TO TEACH IT. AB FOURTEEN TEN WILL PREPARE TEACHERS TO TEACH THE ASK WHAT PRIORITIZING FUNDING TO AREAS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES. NOT EVERY STUDENT NEEDS TO BE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER HOWEVER ALL STUDENTS WHO TO UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY. COMPUTER SCIENCE OPENS DOORS THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HARNESS THEIR CREATIVITY TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGY. TO HOPEFULLY USE THAT TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD AND IMPACTS SOCIAL CHANGE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MEMBERS I'D COURTING JENSEN WITH TECH MAN -- A LATE HOUR ALL TO BE VERY QUICK AND SAY WE KNOW STUDENT EXPOSURE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AT A YOUNG AGE IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY GAP. IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELDS AND PROVIDE THE WORK FORCE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. OUR TEACHERS NEED MORE ACCESS TO TRAINING SO MORE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS CAN OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION. AB FOURTEEN TEN WILL ASSIST IN THIS TRAINING WHILE PRIORITIZING FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS -- WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL IT'S A GREAT STEP IN MOVING TOWARDS -- MAKING SURE THEIR TEACHERS ARE WELL TRAINED -- IN COMPUTER SCIENCE -- AND WE'RE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVALS.

WHICHEVER YOUR PREFERENCES ARE FOR FILE ITEMS NAY BY WITH FIVE EIGHT OKAY WE'LL BE HEARING THEN AB NUMBER TWO FIVE EIGHT THANK YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST SIR WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO FIVE EIGHT A BILL THAT WE USE FUNDS FROM. PROPOSITION SIXTY SIXTY FOUR YEAR MARK FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION THE FUN OF SUSTAINABLE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THE BILL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SUPPORT SERVICES. THE GRANTS CREATED BY THIS BILL WILL HELP FILL THE VOID AND A NUMBER OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES STAFF. ALLEVIATE THE WORKLOAD OF ALREADY OVERWORKED TEACHERS AND CONNECT SCHOOLS EXISTING COMMUNITY REOURCES THE BILL IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT GRANTS WILL LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY A 50% FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM MEDICARE OUT ADULT ELIGIBLE SERVICES. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS CLEAR AS EVIDENCE IN A TEACHER STRIKES WE HAVE BEEN THAT HAVE BEEN ACROSS THE STATE. EDUCATORS IN BOTH LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND MADE CLEAR THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CURRENT RATIOS OF SUPPORT STAFF ARE TERRIBLE WITH ONE COUNSELOR FOR EVERY SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE STUDENTS ONE NURSE. FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND ONE SOCIAL WORKER FOR EVERY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING STRESS. AND TRAUMA AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS WITHOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES STAFF AND PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS TO ATTENDEES NEEDS WE CANNOT POSSIBLY EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. THIS BILL PROVIDES GRANTS THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ALWAYS. BEST FIT THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS FOR SOME THIS MAY MEAN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR OTHERS TRAINING FIRST TEACHERS. AND IN IDENTIFYING STUDENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT FOR OTHER STILL THE CREATION OF A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER MIGHT BE MOST APPROPRIATE. WHEN STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES STAFF THAT THEY NEED WE SEE INCREASED CLASSROOM ENGAGEMENT BETTER ATTENDANCE AND IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS? THIS PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER A SOME REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN COLORADO WHICH ALSO SAW EFFECTIVE HEALTH PROGRAMS RESULT IN BETTER. PUPIL DISCIPLINE DATA AS WELL WITH SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS DECREASING AFTER IMPLEMENTATION WE OWE IT TO OUR STUDENTS TO PUT THEM IN THE BEST POSITION TO SAY TO SUCCEED. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IS SHERRY COBURN PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA.

OF EDUCATION'S OFFICE OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS BILL IS -- THE AUTHOR SAID IS MODELED AFTER THE COLORADO PROGRAM. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEY PUT IT IN. THEY'VE HIRED OVER AND THIS IS A SMALL STATE WHERE THEY HAVE A MILLION STUDENTS NOT LIKE OUR STATE. THEY'VE HIRED OVER -- TWO HUNDRED NURSES IN THE STATE SOCIAL WORKERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS. THERE LEGISLATOR THOUGHT IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY KUDROW PULLED THE FUNDS FOR IT FOR OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S COME OUT OF IT -- WHAT THEY FOUND FOR EXAMPLE IS BY HAVING A SCHOOL NURSE OR A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL -- THE USER THERE CANNABIS INITIATIVE FUNDS FOR THIS SO USING THEIR CANNABIS INITIATIVE FUNDS THEY HAD A SCHOOL PROFESSIONAL THE COULD ASSESS KIDS IN REFER THEM QUICKLY FOR TREATMENT. AND THEN WORK OUT PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH DRUG DIRECTLY WITH OTHER STUDENTS PROBLEMS WERE KIDS MIGHT GET INTO DRUGS BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE YET. AND THEY DELIVERED EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS FOR THOSE KIDS AND THEY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR RATE OF DRUG USE. INCREASE EVEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THEIR MARIJUANA INITIATIVE. SO THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT WILL PROVIDE FUNDS THROUGH THE CANNABIS SHOULD INITIATIVE WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE FIFTY FIFTY MATCH. TO BRING DOWN MEDI CAL FUNDS FOR THE SCHOOL PROFESSIONALS WE NEED THESE PROFESSIONALS IN THE SCHOOLS THEIR CRITICAL TO LINK TO SERVICES INTO TREATMENT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE.

IF THEY SERVE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF PLANT BASED OPTIONS FROM A BASELINE YEAR -- THIS ACT WILL ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING THREE THINGS ONE ASSISTS SCHOOLS TO EXPAND THEIR AVAILABLE FOOD AND BEVERAGE THAT EXPAND THEIR AVAILABLE FOOD AND BEVERAGE CHOICES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY PLANT BASED OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

STEPS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE PROVIDE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL PEOPLE AND SHOWING COMPASSION TO SUPPORTING THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND AS MANY EVEN ARE GOING ABOUT A RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED -- THE HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL YOU MAY BENEFITS A PLANT BASED DIET. INSTITUTIONS AS THE MASTER NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES REGULARLY EXTOL THE VIRTUES AND BENEFITS OF A PLANT BASED DIET AND THE BENEFITS PRESENTS MEDICALLY SOCIETALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY. PLANT BASED DYES HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL INCREASE CONSUMPTION OF FIBER AND NATURALLY OCCURRING VITAMINS MINERALS. HELLO THE REST OF CANCER HEART DISEASE DIABETES AND OTHER CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY AS WE KNOW THE JUVENILE DIABETES. IS AN EPIDEMIC IN OUR NATION AND WHETHER IT REFERS TO A SPECIFICALLY ARE NOT IN THE BILL WE DO KNOW THAT AB FORTY SEVEN FOUR SEVEN NINE WILL CERTAINLY HELP US IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT. AND PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT BY REDUCING OUR IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IMPROVE WATER CONSERVATION AND REDUCE HABITAT. DEGRADATION AND DEFORESTATION -- AND FINALLY ALLOWED THAT INCREASED PLANT BASED FOOD PRODUCTION CAN HELP TO IMPROVE THE WORLD'S ABILITY TO MEET FUTURE FOOD SUPPLY DEMANDS. AND SO AGAIN ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR EYES I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THIS IS -- SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY CAN GET BEHIND I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME SUPPORT THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- YOUR FIRST WITNESS THANK YOU -- I'M PARTY. O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CURRY HUMMERS FLOCK AND ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AND ARE MORE THAN HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND SUPPORTERS. IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI FOR SEVENTY NINE AND THE CREATION OF THE PLANT BASED SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN FOR ENJOYING AUTHOR KALRA FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE KIDS HEALTH AND REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S CARBON WATER FOOTPRINT. WE ARE PLEASED TO JOIN MORE THAN SIXTY EDUCATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR AND ANIMAL PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES IN STAFF TRAINING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHY CLIMATE FRIENDLY PLANT BASED FOOD OPTIONS ON THE PLATES OF NEARLY FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AT LEAST TEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LEADING EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE WRITTEN IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF SCHOOL FOOD DIRECTORS CALIFORNIA KIDS ARE OFTEN SERVED HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED HIGHLY PROCESSED INDUSTRIALLY PRODUCED ANIMAL PRODUCT ANIMAL FOODS THAT ARE UNHEALTHY FOR PEOPLE AND THE PLANET. AND WHILE WE ARE NOT ADVOCATING CUTTING MEAT OR DAIRY ALTOGETHER WE BELIEVE THAT ALL KIDS DESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH YOUR ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVES ESPECIALLY SINCE. EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF THESE WATER AND CARBON INTENSIVE FOODS LEADS TO HIGHER RATES OF COSTLY AND DEBILITATING HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE OBESITY. HEART DISEASE AND TYPE TWO DIABETES. EVEN THE THE USTA'S 200-420-0015 DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS EXPLICITLY RECOMMEND THAT. TEENAGE BOYS AND MEN REDUCE THEIR OVERALL INTAKE OF MEAT AND NOTE THAT MOST CHILDREN ARE NOT EATING NEARLY ENOUGH VEGETABLES AND OTHER PLANT BASED FOODS INCLUDING PROTEIN RICH -- NUTS AND LEGUMES. SO IN CONCLUSION BY CAN'T BY ENCOURAGING CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO MAKE MORE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION LUNCHES ARE SERVED EVERYDAY PLANT BASED THIS BILL WILL MEASURABLY REDUCE THE STATE'S FOOD FOOD RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OR PROTECTING AMERICA'S VALUABLE NATURAL RESOURCES ESPECIALLY OUR WATER -- AND IT WILL ALSO IMPROVE OUR RESIDENTS HEALTH FOR GENERATIONS TO COME WHILE SUPPORTING THE STATE'S MANY PLANT BASED FOOD PRODUCERS. SO WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU. AND AS THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIGUEL THE AREA. I'M INTERESTED US. AND I SPENT THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS OPERATING SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS. INCLUDING THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS AS A SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE DIRECTOR IN THE NEVADA UNIFIED SCHOOL THIS DISTRICT. TODAY EVERY DIETITIAN PRINCIPAL TEACHER AND PARENT KNOW THAT FOR A CHILD TO EXCEL IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNING AND THRIVE IN THE CLASSROOM CHILDREN MUST FIRST BE PROPERLY NOURISHED. I'VE SEEN DIRECTLY THE ILL EFFECTS OF HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS AND KIDS AND I SUPPORT A. B. FOUR SEVEN NINE BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE THE ACCESS TO HEALTHY PRESS PLANT BASED FOODS. FOR ALL CHILDREN. TWENTY THREE A MEALS ARE RICH IN HEART HEALTHY FIBER LOW IN SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL EATING A DIET DIET RICH IN PLANT BASED FOODS. LOWERS CHILDREN'S LONG TERM RISK FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE. WE'VE HEARD HEART DISEASE TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OBESITY. IS TRULY A MATTER OF EQUITY. IN FOOD JUSTICE. EVERY CHILD DESERVES ACCESS TO HEALTHY PLANT BASED FOODS THAT ARE MINIMALLY PROCESSED. MANY OF US IN SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE ARE DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN PRY CHILDREN WITH HEALTHIER FOODS HOWEVER IT'S IT IS DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS TO OFFER PLAN MAYES MEALS. BECAUSE OF THE ADDED EXPENSES PLAN BASED BILLS INCREASE COSTS IN FIVE MAJOR AREAS FIRST. FOOD COSTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE BUYING PRE MAY PRODUCT OF THAT ARE HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED TO FOOD PREPARATION IN MY LABOR THAT IT TAKES THREE FOOD SERVICE TRAINING. STAFF TRAINING -- AND FOR REFRIGERATION STORAGE FOR PLANT BASED FOODS AND OF COURSE FIVE MARKETING AND EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS -- EACH OF THESE BROUGH MUST WORK IN TANDEM TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PLANT BASED MEAL PROGRAM. I ALSO THE ONLY TO TELL ANY OF YOU HOW DIFFICULT IS IT IS TO GET CHILDREN TO EAT MORE VEGGIES. MY AND MY SCHOOL DISTRICT ALONE -- MORE MORE STUDENTS ARE EATING VEGETABLES IMPLANT BE SIGNED.

STUDENTS THAT HAVE LIVED THROUGH EMERGENCIES NEED OUR HELP TO WORK THROUGH THEIR TRAUMA FIRST SO THEY CAN HEAL AND THEN RETURN TO BEING STUDENTS IN THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS.

AND WE'RE NOW ON OUR LAST BILLS OF THEIR MEMBERS IN THE BUILDING THEY SHOULD HEAD THIS WAY BECAUSE WILL BE CLOSING THINGS OUT VERY SHORTLY -- MISS SMITH HAS. FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY FIVE AB -- TWELVE THIRTY THREE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADD TO BEGIN I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS ON THIS MEASURE AND I PARTICULARLY LIKE TO THINK OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS MEMBERS AND STAFF AS WELL FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL. CONSIDERATION IN ADDING TO THIS BILL. THE AP EXAM NOT ONLY PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH WAYS TO BOLSTER THEIR COLLEGE RESUMES IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO BY PASS REMEDIATION AND GRADUATE EARLIER FROM COLLEGE WITH SMALLER AMOUNTS OF DEBT. CURRENTLY EXAM FEES ARE NINETY FOUR DOLLARS PER TEST WHICH CAN ADD UP QUICKLY TO A PROHIBITIVE COST EVEN IN JUST ONE YEAR OF A STUDENT'S EDUCATION. THIS IS TRULY AN EQUITY ISSUE IF WE ARE SERIOUS AND OUR COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ACCESS TO RIGOROUS COURSEWORK MUST BE BARRIER FREE FOR EVERY STUDENT. AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED PLACEMENT EQUITY PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO AP EXAMS BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO REDUCE THE EXAM FEE TO FIVE DOLLARS FOR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AP EXAM FUNDING EVENS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL STUDENTS AND PROMOTES GREATER ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENT POPULATION. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE RACHEL LEWIS RACHEL'S AN A. P. LITERATURE TEACHER AT WESTERN SIERRA COLLEGIATE ACADEMY. A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN ROCKLIN CALIFORNIA. AND JORGE UGLY OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOLS THE THIRTEENTH LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. SUPERINTENDENT OUT WE ARE HAS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN K. TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION WITH A STRONG FOCUS IN BACKGROUND ON ISSUES OF EQUITY AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. PRIOR TO SERVING AS SUPERINTENDENT MISTER AGUILAR WAS ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR EQUITY IN ACCESS AT FRESNO UNIFIED HE ALSO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCE CHANCELLOR OF THE EDUCATIONAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AT UC MERCED. TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES YES. GET. OUT OKAY THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME TODAY. HI MY NAME IS RACHEL LEWIS I'M IN ADVANCED PLACEMENT ENGLISH LITERATURE TEACHER AT WESTERN SEER COLLEGIATE ACADEMY IN ROCKLIN CALIFORNIA -- AS A TEACHER AT A SCHOOL THAT MAKES AP CLASSES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS EVERY YEAR I SEE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T BELONG BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TEST FEES. I FIGHT THE BATTLE EVERY YEAR TO LET STUDENTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND MAKE SURE THAT NO STUDENT IS LEFT BEHIND IN THEIR PURSUIT OF COLLEGE CREDIT. I SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT AP TESTS ARE FOR MY STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO LOOK AT EIGHT P. TEST PASSAGE AS A WAY TO SAVE MONEY ON AND GAIN BETTER ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. BY REDUCING THE AP EXAM PETER JUST FIVE DOLLARS FOR STUDENTS TO QUALIFY STUDENTS THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT BE LEFT BEHIND ARE EMPOWERED TO PURSUE RIGOROUS CLASSES TAKE CLASSES FOR COLLEGE CREDIT AND EXPAND THEIR COLLEGE PORTFOLIOS AHEAD OF APPLYING TO HIGHER EDUCATION. WHEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO AP TESTS THEY DO WELL? JUST LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA RANKED FIFTH IN THE ENTIRE NATION FOR HIGH ACHIEVING ADVANCED PLACEMENT TEST SCORES AMONG GRADUATING STUDENTS. ACT IS WE MUST ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS A. P. EXAMS AT A LOW PRICE SINCE STATE FUNDING SOON EXPIRES AND FEDERAL FUNDING HAS LEFT STUDENTS BEHIND. THAT'S WHY TEACHERS LIKE ME SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE AT THE HIGHEST ACADEMIC LEVELS POSSIBLE. I URGE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE TO PROMOTE EQUITY AND OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKE A PEE TEST MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON WE ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON LEE LANI I'M GOING OUT ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OBVIOUSLY I AM NOT HEY I CAN LEARN. I APOLOGIZE HE HAD HE WAS HERE EARLIER AND HE HAD TO LEAVE HERE -- TODAY BUT I WILL BE PRESENTING HIS STATEMENT SO ON BEHALF OF COURSE YEAH KILLER AS SUPERINTENDENT SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE BECAUSE EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME OR SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. AT SAKS CITY UNIFIED WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROMOTING EQUITY IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THIS YEAR WE HAVE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED EVERY STUDENT ENROLLED IN AP COURSES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AP EXAM FOR THAT COURSE THEN WE COVER THE COSTS FOR EVERY STUDENT TO TAKE THE AP EXAM. WE ALONG WITH DOZENS OF OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE USING THE LAST BIT OF COLLEGE READINESS BLOCK GRANT FUNDS TO SET TO EXPIRE AT THIS HERE. AND WE SEE THE IMPACT THIS INVESTMENT IS MAKING THIS YEAR IN 1-718-300-0200 AND SIXTY EXAMS RETAIN AP EXAMS WERE TAKEN AND SEX CITY. AND THE SCHOOL YEAR -- WE'RE ON TRACK FOR FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE A. P. EXAMS THIS YEAR AND WE BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT WERE TO ME FOR MAKING THIS YEAR FOR STUDENTS. WE COVER THE COST FOR EVERY STUDENT TO TAKE AP EXAMS BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE A. P. EXPERIENCE BENEFITS TEENS IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST E. P. STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE IN FOUR YEARS. STUDENTS WHO TAKE LONGER TO GRADUATE AT PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CAN SPEND UP TO NINETY NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL YEAR. SECOND A. P. STUDENTS HELP CALL AP EXAMS HELP STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS 31% OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOOK AT EIGHT EIGHT P. EXPERIENCE WHEN DETERMINING SCHOLARSHIPS. AND FINALLY AP EXAM PARTICIPATION IS A POSITIVE INDICATOR TO COLLEGES DESPITE THE EXAM SCORE WHEN STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN AP EXAMS COLLEGES SEE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO CHALLENGE THEMSELVES. SO WE CAN'T LEAVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS BEHIND I URGE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY THREE TO MAKE SURE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE TO ACCESS THESE IMPORTANT TESTS THANK YOU. WE GOT AROUND HALF OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. KYLA BEHALF OF THE ADDED CENTER FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A CORONA NORCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.
