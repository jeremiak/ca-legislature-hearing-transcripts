ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS I'M

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.773
WHERE I DECIDED TO BASE MY

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.041
PRACTICE WAS.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.844
THE ABILITY TO NOT BE STUCK WITH

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.779
ONE COMPANY -- IN THE STRUCTURE

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.414
I HAVE NOW I AM ABLE TO WORK

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.155
ESTATE PLANNING IN MY FEE BASED

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.290
BUSINESS THAT HAS TO DO WITH

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.325
FINANCIAL PLANNING ITSELF.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.460
MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:57.263
THAT -- THIS WILL HELP -- YOU'RE

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.198
PROTECTED THAT WAY IF I'M

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.833
RESTRICTED FROM BEING ABLE TO

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.635

I BECOME A CAPTIVE AGENT AND THE

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.806
WAY THAT I WORK.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.174
I DON'T SEE THAT IS BENEFICIAL

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.043
TO THE END USER SO PART OF THE

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:12.445
VALUE THAT I BRING IS THAT I CAN.

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:13.846
EVALUATE SOME A SITUATION AND

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.281
THEN GO SHOPPING THE MARKET

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.549
PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.285
THE BEST THING POSSIBLE SO -- I

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.520
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.089
I'M ABLE TO DO THAT -- WITH ALL

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.624
MY DIFFERENT CLIENTS AND KEEP

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.792
THE FLEXIBILITY MY SCHEDULE I

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.694
REALLY ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO NOT

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.162
ONLY SET MY OWN HOURS -- BUT BE

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.229
ABLE TO SEE CLIENTS LATE AT

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.764
NIGHT JUST LAST WEEK I HAD TO

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.300
CLIENTS I SAW EIGHT AND NINE PM

IN MY OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO AS AN

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.170
HOURLY EMPLOYEE I WOULDN'T BE

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.272
ABLE TO FLEX MY SCHEDULE. FOR

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.174
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.175
IT DOES THEMSELVES MARRIED

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.743
COUPLES THAT WORK ON HOURS THEY

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.078
DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.146
BETWEEN EIGHT AND FIVE LIKE A

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.414
NORMAL BANK WOULD OFFER TO YOU --

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.382
AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.684
IMPORTANT AS WELL -- THAT WE BE

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.387
ABLE TO KIND OF PROTECT THAT WAY.

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.289
BEYOND NOT BEING ABLE TO GROW MY

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.890

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:58.891
RULES OF COME THAT MAKE IT

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.793
REALLY UNCLEAR ON HOW.

I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIRE PERSONAL

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.730
SYSTEM TO FUTURE OR SOMEONE THAT

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.198
MIGHT SET APPOINTMENTS OR HELP

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.499
BRING MEETINGS FOR ME IF I WANT

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.800
TO BRING ON A JUNIOR -- SO THOSE

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.402
THINGS ARE A VERY BIG CONCERN TO

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.637
ME AS WELL AS SOMEBODY WHO'S

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:12.405
MAYBE ONLY TWO YEARS INTO THEIR

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.741

LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.124
OPPOSITION.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.592
I'M I WANT TO BEGIN WITH WHAT'S

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.027
AT STAKE WHEN WORKERS GET

SOMEONE.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.071
YOU LOSE OUT ON VIRTUALLY EVERY

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.907
LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AN AXE

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.575
TO PROTECT WORKERS.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.609
I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:31.977
ABOUT PEOPLE WITH A CRIMINAL

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.012
RECORD.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:34.180
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.115
LAWS TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.883

TO DENY THEM EMPLOYMENT.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.892
LAWS TO REQUIRE WILL PAY MINIMUM

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:51.897
WAGE WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY.

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:52.898
ALL OF THOSE ARE LOST WHEN A

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.134
WORKERS MISCLASSIFIED.

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:55.768
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS ISSUE SO

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.970
IMPORTANT. FOR MANY DECADES THE

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.772
LABOR MOVEMENT HAS FOUGHT THE

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.373
PROBLEM OF MATH CLASSIFICATION

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.341
WHERE WE SEE AN EROSION IN

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.410
WORKERS RIGHTS.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.945
INTEGRATED STANDARDS.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.346
THE DYNAMICS DECISION WHICH WAS

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:09.081
UNANIMOUS DECISION ISSUED LAST

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.917
YEAR BY OUR STATE SUPREME COURT.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.720
IT OPTED A CLEAR SIMPLE

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:15.955
OBJECTIVE STANDARD.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.090
I'M A BIT SURPRISED THAT THE

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:20.893
BUSINESS COMMUNITY WOULD EMBRACE.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.027
A STANDARD.

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:24.096
NOT THAT NOT THE EXISTING LAW

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:24.663
PRIOR TO DYNAMAX THE BROTHER

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.765
TEST -- BUT THE FEDERAL LAW

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:27.900
WHICH IS.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.135
A SIMILARLY SUBJECTIVE

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:32.304
COMPLICATED SO I LOOK ONLY AT

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.107
THE THE FIRST ONE UP THERE THE

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:37.910
NEEDS OF THE NATURE AND DEGREE

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:38.944
OF CONTROL BY THE PRINCIPAL.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.145
THE AMOUNT OF WORKERS INVESTMENT

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.947
IN FACILITIES THE EXTENT TO

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.649
WHICH SERVICES RENDERED ARE AN

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.283
INTEGRAL PART OF THE PRINCIPLES

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.019
BUSINESS THOSE ARE COMPLEX.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.088
THE FACTORS THAT REQUIRE A GREAT

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.489
DEAL OF ANALYSIS FROM OUR

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.391
PERSPECTIVE THE CLEAR SIMPLE

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.193
TESTING DYNAMAX.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.828
WILL REDUCE LITIGATION WILL

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.796
PROVIDE CLARITY FOR WORKERS AND

00:14:57.863 --> 00:15:00.532
THE PLAYERS ABOUT WHAT THE TRUE

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.134
NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS.

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.637
AT THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.372
NOT EVERY WORKER IS

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:07.373
APPROPRIATELY COVERED BY THE

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.508
DYNAMICS TEST THAT IS WHY WE ARE

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:10.943
SPONSORING A BILL.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.077
THAT IS A VEHICLE FOR

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:13.312
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.614
COMMUNITY I BELIEVE SOME OF THE

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.216
WITNESSES THAT SPOKE MAY

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.785
ACTUALLY BE EXEMPTED I'M NOT

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:20.653
EVEN SURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.321

THAT OWNS THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.224
IS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES BUT

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:26.892
TO THE EXTENT IT WOULD I THINK

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.227
THEY'RE PROBABLY EXEMPTED UNDER

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.561
AB.

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:30.529

WORKERS.

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.838
ABSOLUTELY AND THERE IS NO DOUBT

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.239
THAT IN MY MIND OR THE

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.607
OPPOSITION'S MINE AND I AGREE

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:36.975
WITH THEM THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.510
BUSINESSES A VERY FEW.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.245
THAT DO EXPLOIT WORKERS BUT WE

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.214
NEED -- TO WE HAVE THE

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:42.948
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.216
RELATIONS AND LABOR STANDARDS

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.118
INFORMANTS FORSMAN THAT IS AN

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:46.952
ENFORCEMENT ARM OF OUR LABOR

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.719
CODE.

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:49.087
OF OUR LABOR LAW AND THEY CAN GO

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.123
AFTER THOSE BUSINESSES TO PUNISH

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:56.328
AN ENTIRE GIG ECONOMY TO PUNISH.

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:57.129
OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:58.964
THAT FIND THEIR WAY TO GENERATE

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:03.302
ADDITIONAL INCOME -- FOR FORWARD

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:04.570
FOR LACK OF AFFORDABILITY YOU

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.338
KNOW TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:07.205
SUBSTITUTE THEIR INCOME LIKE

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.641
THAT THE RETIREE WHO SPOKE.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.776
AT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:11.977
ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ARTIST WHO

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.412

THREE CHILDREN WORKING ON ITS

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:17.449
<i><u>WN HOURS. TO TO LIMIT THEM --</i></u>

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.484
FROM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.254
IN -- THEIR CHOICE OF EMPLOYMENT

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.556
IS VERY DISTURBING -- WHEN YOU

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.857
LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION THAT CAME

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.993
THROUGH ON THAT THE -- THE

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.798
DYNAMICS DECISION AND IT SAID

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:35.000
THE DYNAMICS -- BRINGS IT BRINGS

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.635
MORE CLARITY -- I THINK THIS

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:37.436
BILL BRINGS MORE CLARITY WHEN

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.103
YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.171
DECISION OUR BILLS ARE BILLS

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:40.305
BASED ON FEDERAL LAW WHICH

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.640
DOESN'T PARTISAN COMP CONFLICT

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:42.708
WITH FEDERAL LAW.

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.776
AND IT'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT NOT

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.445
JUST DISTRICT AS THE DYNAMICS

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.514
DECISION BUT NOT AS LIBERAL AS

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.383
THE CARRILLO TASKS SO IT BRINGS

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.985
THINGS BACK INTO PERSPECTIVE

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:54.152
JUST ON AN ECONOMIC.

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.254
PERSPECTIVE JUST LAST WEEK THERE

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.756
WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER FOR

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.191

CHILDREN SHE VOLUNTEERS ARE CAN

CANCER PATIENTS AND SHE STATED

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:07.065
IN OUR ARTICLE THAT SHE'S GOING

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:09.234
TO BE FORCED TO BE AN EMPLOYEE?

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:10.302

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.870
DO THAT WITH LIKE I SAID IN MY

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.105

OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.731

PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE

IN.

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:43.895
PRESENTING A BILL SO I BUT I DID

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:44.796

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.666
A REALLY.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.101
IMPORTANT ISSUE ABOUT WHAT THE

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:50.235
FUTURE WORK IS GOING TO LOOK

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.804
LIKE -- IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:56.708
NATIONWIDE SO -- I'D I THINK --

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:58.043
I WOULD HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.846
DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHORED THAT --

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.080
YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A FEW

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:03.248
BUSINESSES THAT WOULD EXPLOIT

00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.983
WORKERS I THINK A LOT OF

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.718
BUSINESSES DO BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:07.919
HAVE TO PAY THE EXTRA COSTS

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.621
ASSOCIATED WITH BEING AN

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:13.058
pPENSION THEY DON'T WANT TO OFFER.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.860
SICK LEAVE THEY DON'T WANTED TO

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:15.460
MEET.

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:16.728
IF YOU SAID EVERYBODY YOU'RE ON

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.764
YOUR OWN ULTIMATELY AT THE END

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.798
OF THE DAY IT SAVES THESE

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.266
EMPLOYERS I THINK A LOT OF MONEY

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.702
AND THEN ALL THE WORK THAT'S

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:24.469
BEEN DONE.

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.404
TRY TO GIVE EMPLOYEES AND

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.173
WORKERS CERTAIN RIGHTS AND

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.475
CERTAIN BASIC RESPECT AND A

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:33.578
CERTAIN -- A SAFETY NET ARE ALL

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.113
OUT THE WINDOW IN AND I

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.149
APPRECIATE THAT MILLENNIALS LIKE

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:38.416
CERTAIN FREEDOMS BUT THEY

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:39.851
HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE POINT YET I

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.586
SUSPECT MOST OF THEM.

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.455
WHEN THEY HAVE A SICK FAMILY

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:46.124
MEMBER OR THEY NEED TO TAKE SOME

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:48.326
KIND OF LEAVE OR -- THEY'RE

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:49.795
GETTING OLDER AND WOULD LIKE TO

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:51.263
HAVE A RETIREMENT AND DISCOVER

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:54.432
THERE ISN'T ANY SO -- BUT BUT I

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:55.333
DO THINK THERE'S A BALANCING

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.203
HERE -- AND THAT'S WHY I WAS

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.771
INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENTS.

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:00.772
HOW ARE I THINK THIS?

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.674
I AGREE I THINK THIS THESE SIX

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:03.775
CRITERIA.

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.112
CALL FOR ALL SORTS OF YOU KNOW

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:09.414
SPLITTING HAIRS I SEE THAT I SEE

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.283
THIS IS A LAWYER'S DREAM.

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:12.784
OF FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT WHICH IS

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:14.219
IRONIC BECAUSE USUALLY I'M FEUD

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.921
IS THE ONE THAT LIKES LAWYERS.

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.422
AND WANTS TO SEE THEM BE DOING

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.325
MORE WORK BUT THIS TO ME IS --

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.593
THIS REALLY WILL GIVE YOU AN

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.695
OPPORTUNITY PARKS HERE'S LIKE

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.764
NOBODY'S BUSINESS SO -- I DO

00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:27.566
THINK THAT THE THREE PART TEST

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:30.368
OF DYNAMICS IS A GOOD ONE BUT I

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:32.103
DO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.538
SOME PLACES WHERE WE COULD

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.607
TIGHTEN IT UP AND I WOULD YOU

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.108
MENTIONED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:38.710
HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE YOU.

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:39.244
MIGHT.

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:40.812
SEE THIS GOING SO THAT WE CAN

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:44.716
CREATE A A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.418
I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:47.552
BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE A

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.221
LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS BOTH ABOUT

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:51.523
WHAT THE DYNAMICS TEST DOES AND

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.624
MEANS FOR PEOPLE.

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:54.326
AND ALSO THE WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.561
CHANGE IT -- WITHOUT STRIPPING

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:57.329
WORKERS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.464
RIGHTS SO I WOULD START BY

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:01.333
SAYING -- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.667
DYNAMAX I MEAN IN THE CASE IT'S

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:04.336
ABOUT A PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:05.937
AND THEY SAY THE PEOPLE

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.906
DELIVERING YOUR PACKAGES CAN'T

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.140
BE CALLED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:10.308
THAT'S ALL YOU DO YOU'RE A

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:11.710
DELIVERY COMPANY THEY SHOULD BE

00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:16.114
YOUR DRIVER'S.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.749
ADDITION YOUR EMPLOYEES I'M.

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:18.483
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT BY NO

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.184
MEANS MEANS THAT A FINANCIAL

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.285
PLANNER SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.686
WORK WITH DIFFERENT COMPANIES

00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:23.255
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.323
CAN CLARIFY.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.425
BUT BOTH THE FACT THAT CERTAIN

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:30.028
KINDS OF PROFESSIONALS ARE A LOT

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:32.030
LESS LIKELY TO BE CLASSIFIED

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:33.498
DON'T FACE THE SAME KINDS OF

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.600
ISSUES -- BUT ALSO THAT THAT'S

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.602
NOT WHO IS OUR PRIORITY TO TRY

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:38.803
TO PROTECT THOSE ARE PEOPLE WITH

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.505
A LOT OF MARKET POWER HIGHER

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:41.873
INCOMES MORE EDUCATION MORE

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.074
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE THEIR

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.409
WORKING CONDITIONS.

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:45.911
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CARVED OUT

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:47.512
ALREADY FOR PROFESSIONAL

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.781
CATEGORIES TO SAY YOU GUYS GO

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:50.949
BACK TO CARRILLO TO THE MORE

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.318
KIND OF NEW WANTS TO TEST RATHER

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.786
THAN THE DYNAMAX.

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:56.054
AUTOMATIC TEST BUT ALSO THIS

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:57.555
ISSUE OF KIND OF BUSINESS TO

00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:58.924
BUSINESS CONTRACTING.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.692
IF YOU'RE A FINANCIAL PLANNER

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.060
AND YOU WANT TO CONTRACT WITH

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:04.095
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.830
THAT THAT RESOURCE.

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:08.466
THAT PERHAPS IS THE TYPE OF

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:09.200
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS ON ACTING

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:10.502
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.103
IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.872
PREVENTS A BUSINESS IN FACT THE

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.473
COURT TRIES TO DISTINGUISH.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.542
BETWEEN A BUSINESS THAT WANTS TO

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:20.245
CONTRACT FOR SERVICES TO THE

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:24.382
BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:26.117
YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED A MECHANIC

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.519
TO COME IN AND REPAIR THOSE

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:28.420
DYNAMICS DELIVERY TRUCKS DOES IT

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:29.554
NEED NOT BE EMPLOYEES OF DYNAMAX

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.422
BUT IF THERE THE REGULAR

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:31.823
DELIVERY DRIVERS.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.158
THEY SHOULD BE AND SO I THINK WE

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:35.126
CAN CLARIFY THAT IN A WAY THAT

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.661
WILL PUT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.196
MINDS AT EASE I THINK THERE'S

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.531
BEEN A LOT OF HYPE THAT DYNAMAX

00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:40.031
WAS GONNA.

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.233
STOP INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.802
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT THE

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:47.038
DECISION DOES OR IS INTENDED --

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.540
TO TO DO TO THE ECONOMY IT'S

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.675
REALLY MEANT TO SAY IF YOU ARE

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.644
THERE WORKING FOR ONE BUSINESS

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.112
DOING THAT REGULAR WORK IN THAT

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:56.047
BUSINESS YOU'RE PROBABLY AN

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:56.781
EMPLOYEE.

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:59.250
SO I HAVE TO COME ON BEHALF OF

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:03.221
PROBABLY MANY OF YOU OUT HERE

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:03.755
WE'VE HEARD FROM YOUR HAIR

THE RULING AND HOW THAT IMPACTED

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:11.596
THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.398
ALSO IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE WHO

THEY'RE MAKING SIXTY EIGHTY

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.308
DOLLARS AN HOUR [inaudible]

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.544
UNDER THE INTERPRETATION THAT

I'VE HEARD ABOUT IS I'VE BEEN

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.914
VERY NERVOUSLY GETTING MY HAIR

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.450
IN ORDER SHORT HERE YOU CAN'T DO

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.918
TOO MUCH IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:10.288
MARGIN FOR ERROR -- IS THAT YOU

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:12.991
END UP WITH -- OF SITUATIONS

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:15.326
WHERE -- YOU'RE NOW AN EMPLOYER

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:16.194
THEY'RE NOT INDEPENDENT

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.929
CONTRACTORS EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:18.830
BASICALLY ARE.

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:21.199
MAKING SIXTY EIGHTY DOLLARS AN

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:23.568

YOU SHUT DOWN YOUR SHOP.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:27.138
AND AS I UNDERSTAND THERE A LOT

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.306
OF HAIRDRESSERS WHO WERE NOW.

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:30.308
KIND OF LEAVING THE PROFESSION --

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.876
THEY'RE NOT SMALL BUSINESS

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:33.044
PEOPLE OR THEY BUT THEY DON'T

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:34.212
KNOW SHOP ANYMORE.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.982
EVERYBODY'S IN IT FOR THEMSELVES --

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.384
I'M NOT SURE WAS THAT WOULD

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.086
TIENEN MAKES TRYING TO

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:43.521
ACCOMPLISH.

00:28:43.588 --> 00:28:46.324
IT CAN YOU I MEAN I I GET LESSEN.

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:47.158
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION YES I

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:47.892
HAVE LEARNED SENATOR JACKSON IF

00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:49.627
WE WANT TO GET ANYTHING DONE WE

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:50.528
GOTTA GET THE HEADREST ON BOARD

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.096
YEAH BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.465
STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:54.232
HAIR DRESSERS.

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.033
OF THEM.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.468
I THINK RIGHTLY SO YES AND

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.069
RIGHTLY SO RIGHT WITH THAT I

00:28:58.136 --> 00:28:58.436
WILL SEE.

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:00.038
WE ON BEHALF OF LABOR WE HAVE

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.773
BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.441
BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR ABOUT SIX

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:06.177
MONTHS NOW ON ON HOW TO DEAL HOW

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.879
TO IMPLEMENT THIS DECISION HOW

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:09.314
TO CLARIFY THIS DECISION.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.216
WHO IS PROPERLY COVERED I THINK

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:20.024
WE ALL RECOGNIZE WITHIN A SALON

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.426
THERE ARE?

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:22.827
A WIDE VARIETY OF LABOR

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:23.928
ARRANGEMENTS SOME OF THEM LOOK A

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:24.462
LOT MORE LIKE LEGITIMATE

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:25.463
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT ARE

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.531
PERHAPS RENTING A SPACE ALMOST

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:27.232
MORE LIKE A LANDLORD TENANT

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:28.333
ARRANGEMENT BUT A LOT.

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:28.967
DON'T THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE AN

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:29.601
EMPLOYEE ARRANGEMENT AND I THINK

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:31.035
WE'RE WORKING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.037
DO YOU DISTINGUISH THAT MODEL

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.606
FROM A DIFFERENT MODEL AT OTHER

00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:35.940
HAIRDRESSERS WHERE.

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:37.475
THERE'S A PRICE LIST ON THE WALL

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:39.010
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TAKE WALK INS

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:39.944
ARE REQUIRED TO WORK CERTAIN

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:41.412
HOURS THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE AN

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.214
EMPLOYEE MODEL AND OUR GOAL IS

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.049
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DRAW THAT

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.584
LINE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.219
INDEPENDENCE. TO SET THEIR OWN

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.854
RATES TO SET THEIR OWN HOURS ARE

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.156
ABLE TO DO THAT LEGITIMATELY AS

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:52.924
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS NOT

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:54.092
COVERED BY DYNAMAX.

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.793
VERSUS EMPLOYEES WHO ARE KIND OF

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.695
TOLD WHAT TO DO YEAH AND ARE

00:29:57.762 --> 00:29:58.997
GENERATING WORK OF THE

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.598
EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS ARE TREATED

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.933
DIFFERENTLY AS EMPLOYEES SO I

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.934
THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:03.468
JUST.

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:06.171
CITING A HAIRDRESSER AND AND I

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.539
THINK ALL THE FOLKS IN THIS FROM

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.407
WHO USE HAIRDRESSERS WOULD AGREE

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.575
IT IS A SENSITIVE TOPIC IS.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.777
BUT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS WHERE

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:14.646
WHERE THE LACK OF CLARITY THIS

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.014
IS WHAT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BUT

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.248
NOT APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.017
TRYING TO GAIN CLARITY I JUST

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:19.584
DON'T THINK.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.719
THAT THAT'S THE THE THE WAY TO

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:26.491
DO IT -- ARE THERE -- GUIDELINES

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:28.326
ARE THERE I DIDN'T TO YOUR

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.194
KNOWLEDGE IS TFE H. FOR THE

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.395
LABOR COMMISSIONER THEY DOING

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.430
ANYTHING TO TRY TO INTERPRET.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.232
A TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:35.667
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.534
PEOPLE FALLING IN A TRAP.

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.303
ON THE OTHER HAND MY BIG CONCERN

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:44.475
IS THAT YOU GET THESE COMPANIES

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:46.477
WHO JUST DON'T TAKE ANY RISKS.

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.879
BECAUSE IT IT IMPACTS OUR BOTTOM

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:52.617
LINE -- AND THERE'S THERE

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.085
THERE'S JUST A THERE'S A SWEET

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.486
SPOT HERE AND I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:56.955
I CAN'T QUITE GET A SENSE OF

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.323
WHERETHAT IS SO YOUR THOUGHTS

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:59.123
ON THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL YEAH NO

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.525
I I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:03.394
WE RECOGNIZE THE REASON WE'VE

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:04.262
SPENT SIX MONTHS MEETING WITH.

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:05.597
JUST ABOUT EVERY BUSINESS.

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.432
ORGANIZATION AND INDUSTRY ON

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:08.933
THIS ISSUE WAS RE REALIZE THAT

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.035
IT HAS A BROAD IMPACT -- AND

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:11.603
THAT.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:14.639
ALSO WE'RE ALL KIND OF THESE ARE

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.040
HYPOTHETICALS WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:17.775
THE COURT WOULD RULE I ASSUME IF

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.277
THE HAIRDRESSER WHO WAS

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.079
INDEPENDENT AND WITH SETTING HER

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.380
OWN RATES.

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:23.815
STUDENT SAID SHE WAS AN EMPLOYEE

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:24.949
APART PROBABLY SAY YOU DON'T

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:25.950
REALLY FIT THE DYNAMAX MODEL BUT

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.919
WE DON'T KNOW THAT SO THAT'S WHY

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.622
WE HOUSE SPONSORED A BILL THAT

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.323
WILL CODIFY THE RULING BUT MAKE

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.359
THESE CLARIFICATIONS AND MAKE

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:35.693
SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.129
WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:39.430
TALK THROUGH WITH AN INDUSTRY

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:41.766
OKAY THIS IS HOW IT WORKS WITHIN

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.568
YOUR INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE ER

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:44.936
DOCTORS CAME TO US AND SAID

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:45.837
WE'RE WORRIED DYNAMAX IS GOING

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:47.238
TO AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE STAFF

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.373
ER'S?

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:49.507
EXPLAIN TO US THE WAY THEY SAPPY

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.875
OURS WE FELT THAT THAT WAS

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.810
CLEARLY NOT WHAT THE PORT WITH

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.212
CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THE ISSUE

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.980
THE DYNAMICS DECISION.

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:56.914
SO WE'VE SAID FROM OUR

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.549
PERSPECTIVE E. R. DAS LET'S GO

00:31:58.616 --> 00:31:59.384
BACK TO PEROT.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.351
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE COVERED BY

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.587
DYNAMAX WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:03.688
THOSE SAME KINDS OF

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:04.188
CONVERSATIONS.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.524
ARE OUR POSITION IS BASICALLY

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.593
THE CLEAR TESTED DYNAMAX SHOULD

YOU HOLD YOURSELF OUT TO THE

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:29.560

YOU'RE STILL.

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.130
PROVIDING SERVICES THAT ARE SO

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:34.665
ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.834
BUSINESS MODEL OF YOURS.

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:39.670
WHOEVER HIRES YOU YOU'RE GOING

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:44.508
WE GOT SOME POINT POINT OF

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:46.443
CLARIFICATION.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.244
YEAH.

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.779
IT JUST IN EVEN EXPAND ON OUT IF

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:49.513
YOU CAN ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.381
ARGUMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:51.315
CREATE AMBIGUITY.

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.583
THAT WOULD BE EXPLOITED BY THE

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.885
BUSINESSES TO MISS CLASSIFY

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:55.820
WORKERS.

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.388
BUT MISS CLASSIFICATION IS A

00:40:57.454 --> 00:41:00.157
PROBLEM -- IN THE UNITED STATES

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:01.559
NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA.

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.660
AND THE ANSWER IS VIGOROUS

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:05.496
ENFORCEMENT -- AND AND AND DR

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:06.797
WAS ALREADY YOU KNOW VIGOROUSLY

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:07.698
ENFORCING.

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.366
THE EXISTING STANDARDS I THINK

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.402
WHENEVER YOU HAVE A BALANCING

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.970
TEST OF ANY NATURE THERE IS

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:15.739
GOING TO BE ROOM FOR ARGUMENT --

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.441
ON THE DIFFERENT FACTORS.

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:19.276
AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF A

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.444
BALANCING TEST.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:24.348
BOB BUT THE THE VIRTUE OF THE

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.482
BALANCING TEST IS THAT.

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.451
IT AVOIDS THE RIGIDITY THAT YOU

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:28.786
HAVE WITH DYNAMAX -- AND THAT

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.521
THIS IDEA THAT NO MATTER HOW

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:32.022
MUCH I WALK LIKE.

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:33.224
AND TALK LIKE A LOOK LIKE A

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.792
INDEPENDENT BUSINESS ON MY OWN

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:37.428
MERIT -- THAT I'M STILL GOING TO

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:38.128
HAVE TO BE TREATED AS AN

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.663
EMPLOYEE.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.332
THAT THE PROBLEM.

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:42.333
IT YOU KNOW WITH DYNAMAX IS THAT

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.735
IT IS JUST UTTERLY REJECT AND

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:45.870
YOU KNOW THERE AND AND THERE

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.304
THERE'S A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:47.938
EVEN ABOUT DYNAMICS I MEAN YOU

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.406

I'M IN THE USUAL COURSE OF

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:55.813
BUSINESS BUT THIS BALANCING

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.248
APPROACH IS VERY POP ONE OF

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:58.015
THEIR SOMETHING REALLY TO BE

ABOUT TO THE THERE'S A

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.462
DISCOMFORT THERE AND AND I KNOW.

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:21.098
IT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I SEE

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:21.865
WITH THE BILL THOUGH IS THAT IT

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.133
IS.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.369
REPLACING DYNAMAX WITH THAT SIX

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:35.946
PART -- REALITIES TEST IN IN IT

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:39.183
IT'S IT SEEMS TO BE PUTTING US

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.751
IN THE SAME UNCERTAINTY AS WE'VE

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:41.151
HAD.

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:42.186
WITH MORELLO AND HISTORICALLY

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:43.220
IT'S NOT BRINGING IT TO THE

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.888
POINT THAT.

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.657
THAT THERE'S A UP.

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.691
THE BE MORE CAN OR AS MUCH

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:48.826
CONFUSION I BELIEVE AND IN THE

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:49.860
STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE SO I I

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.428
DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.396
IN SIMPLE FINDERS OR CLARA FIND

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.931
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.099
HOPEFULLY WHAT.

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.367
AT WHAT BINDING MAKES WILL DO.

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:58.202
AT THE END OF IT I THINK IT

00:43:58.268 --> 00:43:58.736
RAISES SOME VERY IMPORTANT

00:43:58.802 --> 00:43:59.770
POINTS THOUGH I AM AT THANK YOU

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.342

DEVELOPING COMMON RULES BECAUSE-THIS BILL WILL COME TO US AT

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.479
SOME POINT AND WILL HAVE AN

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:11.181
OPPORTUNITY. TO TO TO TO SHAPE

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:13.417
IT IN IN IN THE ANOTHER WAY OR

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:14.885
DID AND MAYBE A LITTLE TWEAKING

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:17.221
HERE AND THERE. TO TO MAKE IT

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:17.855
BETTER WHICH IS THE GOAL WE'RE

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:20.791
ALL TRYING TO DO BUT THE

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:26.030
ANALYSIS I THINK BRINGS UP OF

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:28.165
SOME GOOD POINTS.

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:30.000
ABOUT -- PRICE SETTING VERSUS

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:31.668
WADE SETTING.

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.270
AT BIG THAT'S REQUIRES MUCH MORE

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:33.504
STUDY.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.305
A SECOND IS A SMALL BUSINESS

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.740
OWNER MYSELF.

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.508
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUS

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.809
ON SMALL BUSINESSES SENATOR.

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.377
I THINK THAT'S A EXACTLY WHAT

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:41.278
NEEDS TO BE TO OCCUR IN THIS

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.112
BECAUSE THE CARVE OUTS ARE FOR

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:44.348
THE THE BIG BUSINESSES THE

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:44.748
PEOPLE THAT CAN.

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.150
YELL THE LOUDEST -- BUT IT'S

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.719
THAT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:49.987
RELATIONSHIP.

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.955
CAN TAKE ON MANY DIFFERENT

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.024
LEVELS AND FORMS -- AND AND I%

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:54.892
THINK THAT'S CRITICAL THAT WE

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.194
LOOK AT PROTECT THAT IN SMALL

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:59.663
BUSINESSES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.564
THAT FINALLY THIS ONE TO

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.432
HIGHLIGHT.

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:02.533
THE NEED IN IN YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:03.867
THE MENTION THE RETROACTIVITY I

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:05.335
THINK WE NEED SOME TYPE OF

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:07.171
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR TO

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.972
PROTECT THOSE BUSINESSES WHO.

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.674
RELIED ON WITH THE LAW WAS AT

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.109
THE TIME THEY DID KNOW THE

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:13.377
CHANGES COMING AND RELIED ON

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.545
THAT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:18.215
THAT WE WE A PROTECT THAT.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:19.416
AND THAT THESE DAYS OF

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:20.084
BUSINESSES COULD BE CRUSHED WITH

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.218
THAT RETROACTIVITY IT COULD BE A

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.352
MAJOR.

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:27.658
MAJOR -- ACOSTA IN THERE SO BUT

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:30.461
I AM OF SO THAT KIND OF RELIEF

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.028
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:31.662
SHOULD GO TO THIS GOOD ACTORS

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:32.996
THOSE WHO WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:33.931
AND GET IT RIGHT I AM VERY

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:35.232
CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.533
COMPANIES IN OUR STATE THAT

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.234
OPERATE.

WHO USE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.638
AND AND AND FRANKLY THEY USE

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:43.807
THOSE CONTRACTORS IN IN A IN A

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:44.842
CONSTRUCT?

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.711
I FISH DEALS THE TIPS FROM THE

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.780
WORKERS AND I THINK IT SHOULD

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:52.516
SHAMEFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT --

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.251
IT'S A NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:57.621
LEGISLATIVELY AND I FIND THAT

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:58.856
FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG.

00:45:58.922 --> 00:45:59.790
AS A MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:00.958

THOSE COMPANIES TO THAT THAT THE

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:05.829
WHOLE OF WHAT I WOULD LOOK AT-AND I THINK WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK

00:46:05.896 --> 00:46:08.465
ABOUT IT TO EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR --

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:09.733

00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:20.477
LIKE TO THE OTHER PARTS THAT

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:21.578

BE CLEAR THAT -- FOR HOSPITALS

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.061
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.262
THAN OUR PATIENT SAFETY IN OUR

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:49.065
EMPLOYEE SAFETY WHAT WE DO EVERY

00:57:49.132 --> 00:58:00.877

IS WHAT OUR EMPLOYEES DO HOW WE

TREAT PATIENTS IS BECAUSE OF OUR

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:03.780

COUNTER THAT A LITTLE -- WHEN

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.518
WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE RESULT OF

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:09.185
OUR GOOD PATIENT CARE IS BECAUSE

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:11.421
OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND HOW WE HELP

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:12.889

TO MANAGE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.311
FOR US -- I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:36.079
TO SORT OF THE DENIAL RATE IF I

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:38.548
COULD -- FOR US HOSPITALS HAVE

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:41.584
NOT SEEN SUBSTANTIAL -- DENIAL

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.186
RATES ARE WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:44.821
EVIDENCE WE TOOK A FEW OF OUR

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.056
HOSPITALS -- WE COULDN'T QUICKLY

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.157
AND I'M OUT OF A COUPLE MONTHS

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:49.559
PULL TOGETHER ALL OF OUR DENIAL

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:50.727
RATES BUT WE TOOK A FEW OF OUR

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.195
MEDIUM SIZE SYSTEMS.

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.097
AND OUT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.932
FIVE HUNDRED CASES FILED -- OVER

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.867
A THREE YEAR PERIOD 15% MORE IN

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:00.403
THESE CATEGORIES BUT ONLY 3%

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.938
WERE DENIED AND THAT WAS AFTER A

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:05.208
SUBSTANTIAL REVIEW -- WHICH IS

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.709
WHAT THE WORK COMP SYSTEM I'M

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.378
REQUIRES AND OUR HOSPITALS

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.647
ENGAGE IN -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:12.782
NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.684
PREVENTION POLICIES -- BOTH AS A

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:15.919
PART OF THAT CAL OSHA SYSTEM

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.420
THAT WILL BE NOTED BUT ALSO AS

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:20.123
PART OF OUR WORK COMP SYSTEM.

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:21.224
ON THE MUSCULAR SKELETAL

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:24.294
INJURIES 50% 56% OF CASES WERE

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.763
FILED OVER THAT SAME TIME -- AND

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:29.899
ONLY 2% WERE DENIED SO I I AND

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.100
WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.402
ACCUSATION THAT THERE'S A HIGH

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.604
DENIAL RATE THERE ARE CASES BUT

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.372
AGAIN -- THEY ARE BEING

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:38.141
ADJUDICATED AND MANAGED IN THE

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.343
SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.511
I THINK THE APPLICATION THE

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.513
PRESUMPTION IN THE WORK COMP

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:47.617
SYSTEM ALSO.

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:49.185
OPPOSES ADDITIONAL -- CONCERNS

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.586
ESPECIALLY IN THE MASS OF I

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:51.487
THINK WE'RE WORKING OUT I DIDN'T

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.555
I DIDN'T COUNT BUT IT'S EIGHT I

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.223
THINK -- THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.526
A PRESUMPTION SYSTEM -- AND THE

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:58.795
PRESUMPTION PAUL CAN BE REFUTED

00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.096
WOULD BE HARD TO OVERCOME GIVEN

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.331
THE NATURE OF THE HEALTH CARE

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.433
SYSTEM I'M IN WERE SO THEREFORE

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:04.567
COULD BE AN INSURMOUNTABLE

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:05.768
HURDLE FOR US.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:08.037
I'M GIVEN THE DYNAMICS -- S.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.772
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU CAN DO POST

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.140
EMPLOYMENT.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.743
AS WELL SO IT GOES FORWARD AS

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.345
WELL AND MANY OF OUR NURSES ARE.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.446
A LOT OF OUR NURSES WORK IN TWO

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:17.680
DIFFERENT FIREMAN SO WE WOULD

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.315
STRUGGLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.117

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.027
SYSTEM AND YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.162
THIS BEFORE RELATIVE TO OTHER

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.831
PRESUMPTIONS I THINK AS WAS

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.399
POINTED OUT.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:23.900
A BY THE SPONSORS IN THE

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:24.467
SUPPORTERS AND WE JUST DON'T

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:25.635
BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE NECESSARY

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:26.836
THE ANALYSIS DOES A REALLY GOOD

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:28.804
JOB OF IDENTIFYING ASKING SOME

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.674
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT -- WE AND

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.309
YOU ALL TEND TO ASK WHEN

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.744
PRESUMPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE --

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.345
YOU KNOW WHAT DATA IS THERE TO

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.246
INDICATE.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.181
THAT THERE'S A HIGHER INCIDENCE

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:40.816
pKNOW WHAT DOES WHAT ARE THE

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.052
PREVENTIVE MEASURES -- AND WHAT

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:43.986
ARE THE DENIAL RATES AND I THINK

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.354
THE ANALYSIS DOES A PRETTY GOOD

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:46.322
JOB OF SHOWING THE LACK OF OF

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.324
DATA AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.659
PARTICULAR POLICY.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.460
IT WAS MENTIONED -- THE PRIOR

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:52.562
VERSIONS OF THIS BILL HAVE BEEN

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:53.462
PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:54.797
OTHER COMMITTEES THAT IS

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.899
ABSOLUTELY TRUE -- THEY'VE ALSO

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.568
BEEN VETOED -- IN A BI PARTISAN

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.002
NATURE BY SEVERAL GOVERNORS TO

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:02.572
GOVERNOR'S -- AND THIS

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.540
PARTICULAR VERSION IS BY MY

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:05.675
ESTIMATION THE MOST EXPANSIVE

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.243
VERSION OF THE HOSPITAL WORKER

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.045
PRESUMPTION THAT HAS EVER BEEN --

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.313
HEARD BY THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:11.147
OTHER COMMITTEE IN THE

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.683
LEGISLATURE -- IT FOCUSES ON ALL

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.084
HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES.

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:16.185
IT PROVIDES FOR TEN YEARS POST

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:17.787
TERMINATION ACCESS TO THE

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:20.256
PRESUMPTIONS -- IT'S THE FIRST

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:20.856
TIME IN THIS IS KIND OF A BIG

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.258
DEAL TO US IT'S THE FIRST TIME

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.259
THAT A PRESUMPTION WOULD BE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.094
EXPANDED INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR --

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.462
UP UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN KIND OF A

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.630
GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT --

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.398
THING FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SAFETY

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.768
CIRCUMSTANCES -- INTO THE TO THE

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:33.736
POINT THAT THE SUPPORTERS MADE

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:34.804
EARLIER WE DON'T SUPPORT THOSE

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:35.938
PRESUMPTIONS EITHER WE DON'T

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.139
THINK THEY'RE NECESSARY FOR THE

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:41.577
EXACT SAME REASONS -- AND IN THE

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:42.845
BIG KICKER I THINK IN THIS BILLS

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:43.646
THAT YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.280
CONSIDERED PRE EXISTING

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.249

HEAR THE OPPOSITION -- BOTTOM

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.686
LINE IS IS THAT -- THE ARGUMENT

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.655
SEEMS TO BE THAT -- NUMBER ONE

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.890
IS IT IT'S AN EXPANSION INTO THE

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.693
PRIVATE SECTOR -- AND YES YES IT

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.296
IS -- AND IF THERE'S A GOOD

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:41.630
REASON.

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.232
IT WHETHER IT'S AN EXPANSION

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.500
INTO THE PUBLIC SECTOR OUR

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.768
PRIVATE SECTOR NOT

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:46.702
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.003
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.305
THE OTHER ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.239
THAT IT'S A CONTROLLED

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.208
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT'S INDOORS

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.843
AND IF YOU'VE EVER.

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.911
BEEN IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM -- AND

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.446
SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.215
TIME WHICH AND FORTUNATELY IT

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:00.716
HAD TO DO A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.018
PAST AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:05.388
CHAOTIC PLACES -- IT'S VERY

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:06.922
DIFFICULT CULT TO CONTROL WHAT

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.691
WHAT WHAT WHAT WALKS IN THE DOOR

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:11.627
OR WHAT IS CARRIED IN THE DOOR --

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:14.029
AS AT BACK BY THE FIRST

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:17.600
RESPONDERS AND AND AND JUST AS

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.769
CHAOTIC AS IT IS OUT DOORS IT

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.771
CHAOTIC IN THAT IN THAT -- IN

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.872
THE AT THE HOSPITAL SETTING THEY

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.106
DO THE BEST THEY CAN TO TRY TO

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.441
CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT BUT MANY

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.776
TIMES IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.178
POSSIBLE AND SO -- IF IF THE

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:31.647
ARGUMENT IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.882
NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:34.517
WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:34.950
DOWN AND HAVE THOSE

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.052
CONVERSATIONS -- AS WELL AS TO

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.221
NARROW THAT -- KINDS OF INJURIES --

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.123
BUT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE CHAU

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.591
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THE

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:46.796
INCIDENCE OF OF OF INJURY AND

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.531
ILLNESS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.899
AMONG NURSES.

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:52.802
AND THE THE INFORMATION FROM THE

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:56.505
CALPERS JOURNAL INDICATES

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.174
WORKERS COMPENSATION.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.508
COMPENSATION HAVE SUNK TO A FIVE

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.209
YEAR LOW WHICH IS A GOOD THING --

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.777
IT'S OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.446
THAT UNDER CONTROL BUT BUT

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.381
REALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE WORKERS

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.016
COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.150
YOU CAN EITHER SPEND A LOT OF

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.919
MONEY TRYING TO DENY WORKERS THE

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.321
ABILITY TO GET -- COVERAGE OR

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:15.124
YOU CAN PUTTHE MONEY INTO --

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.126
IMPROVING THE HEALTH CARE OF THE

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.093
WORK.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.495
INJURED OR ARE ILL AND QUITE

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.764
FRANKLY THE EASIEST PLACE TO DO

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.232
IT IS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:24.834
WHERE THE HOSPITAL HAS THE

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.136
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:29.071
WHATEVER IT IS THAT THAT --

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.607
THESE NURSES NEED -- IN TERMS OF

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:35.010
OF OF CARE AND SO -- I WOULD

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:37.046
RESPECTFULLY ASK.

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:39.148
THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.149

THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:42.818
THE TIME THAT WE SPENT.

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.820
LAST EVENING AND AND AND ON THE

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.455
TELEPHONE -- AND I KNOW THIS IS

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.524
IT IT DEEPLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.992

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.427
YES I HAVE.

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.262
TO OF NOTHING BUT THE TREMENDOUS

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:54.730
AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE WORK

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.932
THAT NURSES DO EVERYDAY TO SAVE

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.400
ALL OF US TO STRIP CREEK.

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:00.035
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:04.373
IT'S ON GOING TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.875
A DAY WITH THAT.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:06.642
BUT AS WE'VE TALKED DIE I'M NOT

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.143
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY --

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:08.811
IT BEFORE I GET INTO SOME OF THE

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:10.479
REASONS I I WANT TO STRESS ONE

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:11.013
POINT.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.548
YOU KNOW IT WAS RAISE THE ISSUE

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:17.620

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:56.643
BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.411
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FROM OUR

01:46:58.478 --> 01:47:00.747
PAYCHECK GOES INTO THIS BLOCK TO

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:03.049

ACCESSING A BENEFIT THAT YOU'VE

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.625
ALREADY PAID.

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.026
FOR SO CURRENTLY TWO POINT EIGHT

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:15.028
MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO PAY INTO

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.663
THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:18.231
COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS FOR TAKING

01:47:18.298 --> 01:47:21.935
TIME OFF TO BOND WITH A NEWBORN.

01:47:22.002 --> 01:47:22.803
FIVE POINT SIX MILLION

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.104
CALIFORNIANS COULD LOSE THEIR

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:26.740
JOBS FOR TAKING TIME OFF TO CARE

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:28.809
FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:31.411
MEMBER. TO FIX THESE INEQUITIES

01:47:31.478 --> 01:47:33.613
SB ONE THIRTY FIVE WILL ENSURE

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.449
THAT NEARLY EVERYONE WHO PAYS

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.751
INTO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:38.685
PROGRAM.

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:40.720
WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT WITHOUT

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:42.389
LOSING THEIR JOBS.

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:44.825
BY EXPANDING CIFRA TO EMPLOYEES

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:47.961
WHO WORK FOR EMPLOYERS OF FIVE

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:49.229
OR MORE EMPLOYEES.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:51.264
CURRENTLY THE EMPLOYER THRESHOLD

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:54.100
IS FIFTY FOUR CARE GIVING CLAIMS

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:57.070
AND ONE'S OWN ILLNESS AND TWENTY

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.505
FOR BABY BONDING UNDER THE NEW

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:00.040
PARENT LEAVE ACT.

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:01.842
I WOULD ADD THAT NEW YORK IS

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:03.510
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF A

01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:05.312
MULTI YEAR PHASE IN OF A FAMILY

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.314
LEAVE PROGRAM THAT APPLIES TO

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:08.615
ALL EMPLOYERS.

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:12.118
REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE.

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:15.222
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE THIS.

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.723
TO FIVE THIS BILL ALSO MAKES KEY

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:18.191
CHANGES ON WORK TEN YOUR

01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:20.093
REQUIREMENTS AND ADDS IMPORTANT

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.361
FLEXIBILITY.

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:23.063
CURRENTLY AN EMPLOYEE WHO

01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:25.098
QUALIFIES UNDER SIR.

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:26.433
FOR THE JOB PROTECTION.

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:28.468
HAS TO WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER FOR

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:30.604
TWELVE MONTHS AND HAVE AT LEAST

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:31.504
TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:34.841
UNDER THEIR BELT TO QUALIFY FOR

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:35.709
JOB PROTECTED FAMILY LEAVE.

01:48:35.775 --> 01:48:37.444
THIS CAN CREATE AN UNNECESSARY

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:39.446
HURDLE FOR UTILIZING THE PAID

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.181
FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WHICH YOU

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:44.251
ARE PAYING INTO REGARDLESS.

01:48:44.317 --> 01:48:46.786
SO -- THIS BILL WOULD SHORTEN

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:48.622
THE TENURE REQUIREMENT FOR JOB

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:50.624
PROTECTION TO SIX MONTHS STILL

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:52.492
HAVE PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM BUT

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.561
LESSEN THAT TEN YEAR TIME TO SIX

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:55.295
MONTHS.

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.897
IT WOULD AGAIN BRING CALIFORNIA

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.331
IN LINE WITH NEW YORK'S FAMILY

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:00.600
LEAVE PROGRAM WHICH ALSO HAS A

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:02.035
SIX MONTH WORK TENURE PROGRAM

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:04.337
REQUIREMENT AND SAN FRANCISCO'S

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:06.106
PAID FAMILY LEAVE ORDINANCE.

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:07.040
WHICH HAS A WORK TENURE

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.942
REQUIREMENT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:10.410
DAYS.

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:11.711
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:14.314
FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHO

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.049
CAN TAKE BABY BONDING LEAVE TO

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.684
ENSURE THAT MORE INFANTS GET

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.185
THEIR STRONGEST DEVELOPMENTAL

01:49:19.252 --> 01:49:22.088
START WITH INDIVIDUAL.

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:23.423
AT HOME CARE.

01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:25.358
NO BETTER PLACE FOR AN INFANT TO

01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:27.761
BE SENATE HOME BONDING WITH A

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:28.929
LOVED.

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:30.530
ONE IN FACT NOT ONLY IS IT A

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:31.965
BETTER PLACE BUT WE DON'T HAVE

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:34.701
ADEQUATE CARE FOR THE

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:35.936
ALTERNATIVE THAT'S TRUE.

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:39.072
CURRENTLY 35240% OF INFANTS IN

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:40.540
CALIFORNIA AND I THOUGHT THIS

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:43.043
WAS REALLY OF OF REALLY

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.444
INTERESTING AND SOMEONE.

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:47.247
THOUGHT PROVOKING NOTION THAT

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:48.915
35240% OF INFANTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.717
ARE BORN INTO SINGLE PARENT

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:52.118
FAMILIES.

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:54.120
THERE IS ONLY ONE PARENT THERE

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:54.654
THE MOTHER.

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:57.390
USUALLY TO CARE FOR THIS CHILD.

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:58.658
IF WE HOPE FOR INFANTS TO

01:49:58.725 --> 01:50:00.593
ACHIEVE SIX MONTHS OF INDIVIDUAL

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.729
CARE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.531
CARING ADULTS TAKING TREE MUCH

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:05.465
EACH.

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:07.600
ARE AS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:09.602
WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:12.072
CARE GIVING TO ALLOW CARE BY A

01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:13.473
CARING ADULT.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.241
OTHER THAN A PARENT.

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:17.410
IN THOSE CASES.

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:19.579
SO ON TO OUR GRANDPARENTS WHO

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:21.114
QUALIFIES FOR CIFRA AND

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:22.716
DESIGNATES AN INFANT FOR THEIR

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:23.516
CARE.

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.318
THIS WOULD THIS BILL WOULD ALSO

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.253
EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO

INCLUDE THIS DESIGNATED PERSON.

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:31.524
I MEAN WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS

01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:32.258
THIS IS THE WORLD IN WHICH WE

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.326
LIVE.

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.028
IT IS NOT FATHER KNOWS BEST IT

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.930
IS NOT LEAVE IT TO BEAVER THIS

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:38.598
IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD IT'S

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:40.633
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE HAVE

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.469
GOT TO START MAKING THE

FOR OUR FAMILIES.

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:50.810
THIS MEASURE ALSO EXPANDS THE

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:52.612
DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.547

THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:34.601
BRAIN THAT IMPACT THAT CHILD'S

YEARS OF A CHILD'S LIFE RESULT

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.875

FUTURE FOR THAT CHILD.

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.886
BUT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS BRAIN

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:56.055
SCIENCE MEANS NOTHING IF PARENTS

01:54:56.122 --> 01:54:58.324
ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ACTION TO

01:54:58.391 --> 01:55:00.126
SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN.

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.361
DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:03.162
TAKE BASIC LIMITED LEAVE AFTER

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.597

01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:09.869
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS BRAIN

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:11.004
SCIENCE MEANS NOTHING.

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:13.039
FAMILY LEAVE IS NOT A LUXURY FOR

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:14.841
A PARENT IS A BIOLOGICAL

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.976
NECESSITY FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.311
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:55:18.378 --> 01:55:19.545
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN MINOR

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:21.214
SHORT TERM INCONVENIENCE FOR

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:24.017
EMPLOYERS AND LONG TERM LIFELONG

01:55:24.083 --> 01:55:25.551
BENEFITS FOR A CHILD.

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:27.086
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN NEED TO

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:29.122
WIN THE DEBATE.

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.923
AND WHILE SB ONE THIRTY FIVE MAY

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:32.025
NOT SEEM TO BE ABOUT.

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:33.459
WALLY CHILD CARE IN OUR CRISIS

01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:35.428
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS A SENATOR

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:37.463
INDICATED PARENTS LACK OF ACCESS

01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.032
TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY CARE FOR

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.199
THEIR BABIES.

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.701
IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT FOR

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:44.003
AND A NECESSITY IN LOOKING AT

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.604
HOW WE NEED TO PROTECT FAMILY

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.406
LEAVE IN FACT THE AMERICAN

AT LEAST THREE MONTHS OF AGE FOR

01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:56.616
MEDICAL REASONS.

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.951
INCREASED QUALITY AND LENGTH OF

01:55:59.018 --> 01:56:00.386
PARENTAL LEAVE IS AN INVESTMENT

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:02.255
IN EARLY LEARNING WITHOUT

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:03.790

CALIFORNIA I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.634
THIS LEGISLATION WHICH IS A VERY

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:16.402
PRUDENT NEXT UP. TO CHEESE

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:18.037
ACHIEVING EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR

ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK

01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:29.782
WHICH IS A NONPROFIT

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.250
ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATE ON

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:32.885
BEHALF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS AND

01:56:32.952 --> 01:56:33.720
WHEN I THINK.

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:35.521
AND TEAR PERSON MITCHELL AND

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:36.656
SENATE JACKSON FOR BRINGING THIS

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.658
BILL AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAS

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:39.759
MADE FAMILIES.

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:41.194
WORK PLACES AND CALIFORNIA

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:43.563
STRONGER IT IS A LIFELINE FOR

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.898
WORKING FAMILIES IN THOSE BRIEF

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:48.534
BUT VERY INTENSE MOMENTS OF NEED

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.403
EITHER THE BIRTH OF A NEW CHILD.

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:51.337
OR DEALING WITH A SERIOUS

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:53.406
ILLNESS OFA FAMILY MEMBER.

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:55.141
THESE ARE MOMENTS THAT AS AND

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:57.276
ASTABLE SEATED CAN CHANGE THE

01:56:57.343 --> 01:57:00.246
COURSES OF LIFE FOR EVER.

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:01.614
BUT WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE

01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:03.883
MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES IN OUR

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:06.519
STATE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND --

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:09.021
AND THAT IS THIS THAT THE FACT

01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:11.090
THAT WE SIMPLY MUST REMEDY --

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:12.425
OTHERWISE ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:57:12.492 --> 01:57:13.693
PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT'S

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.361
DESIGNED TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.063
EQUITY WILL ACTUALLY EXACERBATE

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.531
INEQUITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:20.800
SOCIETY. FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:25.037
WORKERS AND LOW QUALITY JOBS --

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:27.240
AMONG THOSE WHO ARE AWARE OF THE

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:29.609
PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM 37%

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:31.210
NOW ELECTED NOT TO USE THE

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:32.178
BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:34.147
AFRAID OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES

01:57:34.213 --> 01:57:35.248
AT WORK.

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:37.116
AND WE KNOW THAT -- A

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.851
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF LOW

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:40.686
WAGE WORKERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO

01:57:40.753 --> 01:57:43.256
THE FUND BUT NOT ABLE TO DRAW

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:45.658
DOWN THE BENEFITS SO FOR EXAMPLE --

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.593
AMONG WORKERS EARNING TWENTY

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.528
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:51.264
LESS THEY ACTUALLY COMPRISE 40%.

01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:53.733
OF CONTRIBUTING WORKERS TO THE

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.569
FUNDS BUT ONLY 24% OF ACTUAL

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.571
CLAIMANTS THERE'S THAT MEANS

01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:00.072
THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:01.574
SUBSIDIZING THIS FUND. FOR

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:04.010
HIGHER EARNERS AND WE NEED TO

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:06.546
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:08.114
THE EQUITY.

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:10.216
AND AVAILABILITY OF THIS --

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:12.285
REALLY IMPACTFUL LIFE ALTERING

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:14.720
BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:16.456
MOST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:20.793
I'M NOT TO MENTION THAT HAS -- A

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.462
REALLY POSITIVE IN. FORTY AND WE

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:23.996
KNOW THAT WHEN A FATHER FOR

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:26.699
EXAMPLE IS ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE --

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:28.901
AND BE WITH THE NEW CHILD IT --

01:58:28.968 --> 01:58:29.735
ALTERS THE CARE GIVING

01:58:29.802 --> 01:58:31.304
RELATIONSHIP FOR THROUGH OUT

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.473
THAT CHILD'S LIFE -- BASED ON

01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:35.441
JUST THOSE FIRST MOMENTS AND

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:38.377
WITHOUT JOB PROTECTION -- DAD'S

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:40.480
AS CENTERED ACTION POINTED OUT

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.348
17% OF THE WORKFORCE IS NOT

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:46.018
ENTITLED TO A SINGLE JOB PROTECT

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.720
pAND AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:58:47.787 --> 01:58:49.722
RARE MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE A

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:52.124
SOLUTION THAT WE KNOW CAN IMPACT

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:54.093
A MORE POSITIVE OUTCOME RIGHT IN

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.795
FRONT OF US AND WE CAN MAKE IT

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:58.498
HAPPEN -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT

01:58:58.564 --> 01:58:59.932
ELEMENT IS THAT -- MOTHERS WITH

01:58:59.999 --> 01:59:01.133
YOUNG CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY THE

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.302
FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:04.670
WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.472
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:07.874
PROTECT THEIR JOBS SO THAT

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.975
THEY'RE NOT ALTERNATELY LEFT

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.476
WITH HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN.

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:12.445
PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILY AGAIN

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:13.279
DURING THESE BRIEF MOMENTS OF

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:15.915
TIME THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY --

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:19.886
TO PREVENT DERAILMENTS -- OF AND

01:59:19.952 --> 01:59:21.220
THE SNOWBALLING NEGATIVE

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:23.456
CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN HAPPEN TO

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:25.191
A FAMILY WHEN THAT WHEN -- FACE

01:59:25.258 --> 01:59:26.659
WITH THOSE REALLY DIFFICULT

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:27.860
CHOICES.

01:59:27.927 --> 01:59:30.062
THIS BILL ALIGNS THE JOB

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:31.764
PROTECTION ELEMENTS WITH THE

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:33.299
PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS.

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.767
SO THE FOLKS WHO ARE PAYING FOR

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:35.935
THE BENEFIT CAN TAKE IT WHEN

01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:39.038
THEY NEED IT -- AND RIGHT NOW

01:59:39.105 --> 01:59:40.740
THE CALIFORNIA JOB PROTECTION

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:42.074
LAWS ARE SIMPLY AN ADEQUATE AND

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:45.011

OVER FIVE MILLION EMPLOYEES ARE

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.447
EXCLUDED FROM THESE DROP

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:52.752

EMPLOYERS THAT ONLY HAVE LET'S

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.756

THE SOME AMOUNT CAN BE TAKEN

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.504
INTERMITTENTLY WHICH MEANS AND

THE EMPLOYER STUCK WITH TRYING

02:03:33.572 --> 02:03:35.141
TO FIGURE OUT WHO CAN COVER FOR

02:08:33.672 --> 02:08:35.674
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CONSIDER --

DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN --

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:39.404
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SO MANY OF

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:40.739
THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:42.374

LAST I LOOKED -- DOING QUITE

WELL -- SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S

02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:54.319
THE PROBLEM BUT IF IT WERE TO BE

02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:56.355
A PROBLEM I'D CERTAINLY BE VERY

02:09:56.421 --> 02:09:58.257
INTERESTED IN TRYING. TO TO TO

02:09:58.323 --> 02:09:59.458
FIGURE OUT A WAY PARTICULARLY

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:00.192
WITH THE SMALLER COMPANY

02:10:00.259 --> 02:10:02.161
COMPANIES THAT OPERATE ON A VERY

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:04.596
SMALL PROFIT MARGIN USUALLY --

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:06.298

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:10.335
NOBODY WANTS TO LOSE THE

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:11.770
BUSINESS IS WHAT WE WANT AD IN

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.038
FACT.

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:17.009
THE DATA SHOWS.

02:10:17.075 --> 02:10:18.510
THAT OF THE COMPANIES ACTUALLY

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:19.711
BENEFIT WHEN THEY PROVIDE THIS

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.380
LEAF THE EMPLOYEES ARE LONGER

02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:22.381
STANDING.

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:24.216
THEY'RE MORE LOYAL I YOU DON'T

02:10:24.283 --> 02:10:25.684
HAVE TO TURN OVER BECAUSE WHAT

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:27.719
HAPPENS FREQUENTLY IT IS THAT

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:29.655
PEOPLE WILL LEAVE.

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.757
THEY HAVE NO WHO WE CAN DO LEAVE

02:10:31.823 --> 02:10:33.192
YOUR CHEAT LEVER TO MONTH HOLE

I GO BACK TO WORK YOU QUIT YOUR

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:38.297
JOB AND SO THEN THE EMPLOYER HAS

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.765
TO FIND NEW PEOPLE AND THE COST

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:40.966
OF TRAINING.

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:43.168
IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT COST

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:47.072
ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO --

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:48.106
ECONOMICALLY AND AND WHAT HAVE

YOU I THINK THIS IS A REAL WIN

02:10:49.808 --> 02:10:51.543
WIN IF IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:53.512
SERIOUS PROBLEM THERE ARE THINGS

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.047
WE CAN DO TO ADJUST IT THEN BUT

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:56.181

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:57.382
YET WITH THE LEAVE THAT WE'VE

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:57.983

02:10:58.050 --> 02:11:00.285
THE FOUR MONTHS THE SEVEN MONTHS

THAT TIME WITH THAT IT'S JUST

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:01.186
[inaudible]

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.754
IT JUST.

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.923
NONEXISTENT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF

02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:06.258
WE WERE TO SEE PROBLEMS THEN

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:08.293
CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT WE

TO POLICY SUCH AS THIS IT IT

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:29.915
RARELY DO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:32.217
QUANTIFIABLE VALUE BOTH ECONOMIC

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.352
AND IN TERMS OF A HEALTHY

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:34.920

02:19:20.151 --> 02:19:21.052
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:23.421
TO ME -- STAFF AT THE PRISONS

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:24.622
ESPECIALLY WHERE I WORK ARE SOLD

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:27.225
AT AN ALARMING RATE DALY --

02:19:27.292 --> 02:19:28.693
WHETHER THAT BE SEXUALLY

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.295
VERBALLY PHYSICALLY -- IT

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.563
HAPPENS MUCH MORE THAN PEOPLE

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.198
ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF IN PART OF

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:34.532
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS

02:19:34.599 --> 02:19:36.668
DATA ISN'T TRACT -- IN A WAY

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.103
THAT MAKES IT READILY AVAILABLE

02:19:38.169 --> 02:19:39.204
FOR EVERYBODY.

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.605
AND BY DOING SO BY HAVING A

02:19:40.672 --> 02:19:41.973
TRACK AND HAVING IT AVAILABLE

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.475
NOT ONLY ARE WE ALLOWING PEOPLE

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:44.375
TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:45.477
IN THESE PRISONS BUT ALSO

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:47.712
ALLOWING US TO HOPEFULLY DEVELOP

02:19:47.779 --> 02:19:48.012
A PATTERN.

02:19:48.079 --> 02:19:48.947
WHICH AS WE KNOW HISTORY HAS A

02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.215
TENDENCY TO REPEAT ITSELF AND WE

02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:51.216
CAN USE THOSE PATTERNS TO

02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:52.317
HOPEFULLY PREDICT FUTURE

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:53.752
BEHAVIOR AND PREVENT FUTURE

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:55.787
ASSAULTS ON STAFF -- ONE REASONS

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:57.122
I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE TODAY

02:19:57.188 --> 02:19:58.690
IS THAT I HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED --

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:01.760
ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS --

02:20:01.826 --> 02:20:02.627
TREATING SOMEONE I NEVER MET

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:03.561
BEFORE.

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:05.130
I WALKED INTO A ROOM AND BEFORE

02:20:05.196 --> 02:20:06.431
I COULD EVEN.

02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:07.932
REALLY GET IN THE ROOM I'M HE

02:20:07.999 --> 02:20:10.001
THREW A LARGE CUP OF YOUR IN MY

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:12.370
FACE AYE AYES MOUTH -- AND

02:20:12.437 --> 02:20:14.539
DRENCH ME MY ENTIRE -- UPPER

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:16.407
HALF MY BODY HAD TO GO TO THE

02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:20.879
EMERGENCY ROOM AND GO THROUGH

02:20:20.945 --> 02:20:22.080
ALL OF THAT AND NOT ONLY IS THAT

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:23.314
SHOCKING TO HAPPEN AT WORK ON

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:23.782
THERE HAVE BEEN SAFETY

02:20:23.848 --> 02:20:24.449
PRECAUTIONS WERE IN PLACE SENSE

02:20:24.516 --> 02:20:26.151
THEN BUT IT IN FRONT OF A LOT OF

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:28.119
PEOPLE CAN BE KIND OF

02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:28.453
EMBARRASSING.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.155
AT A HOSPITAL -- EVERYONE KNOWS

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:32.757
ABOUT IT AND YOUR LITTLE AREA --

02:20:32.824 --> 02:20:34.259
HOWEVER THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

02:20:34.325 --> 02:20:35.593
KNOWN.

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.028
ACROSS THE STATE SO WHEN THAT

02:20:37.095 --> 02:20:38.696

EVERYONE SO WE KNOWS THE HISTORY

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:41.166
BEHIND THAT.

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:42.433
SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:43.501
FOR US TO HAVE A WAY TO TRACK

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:44.869

SUPPORT THIS BILL.

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.014
AS WAS MENTIONED THE

02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:25.015
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HAS KIND

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:26.717
OF IN RECENT YEARS OF ALL THE

02:30:26.784 --> 02:30:28.886
WAY FROM THE ONE THAT WAS THAT

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:30.788
THE D. I. N. PFL PROGRAMS WERE

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:31.589
CREATED.

02:30:31.655 --> 02:30:32.990
FOR IT WOULD CREATE A KIND OF A

02:30:33.057 --> 02:30:35.192
UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE -- IN

02:30:35.259 --> 02:30:37.328
MANY CASES WORKERS DO QUALIFY

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:38.963
FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT BECAUSE

02:30:39.029 --> 02:30:39.930
SO MUCH OF THE WORK IS OUT OF

02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:40.631
STATE.

02:30:40.698 --> 02:30:41.766
AND THERE'S THIS LACK OF CLARITY

02:30:41.832 --> 02:30:43.901
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT EMPLOYER

02:30:43.968 --> 02:30:44.535
SHOULD BE PAYING IT WHEN THEY

02:30:44.602 --> 02:30:45.536
ARE OUT OF STATE.

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:46.470
IS STILL QUALIFY BUT THE

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:47.738
BENEFITS ARE SO LOW THAT THE

02:30:47.805 --> 02:30:48.873
WORKERS DON'T HAVE MEANINGFUL

02:30:48.939 --> 02:30:49.907
ACCESS TO IT.

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:50.841
I WE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:52.510
ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.145
ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS IS THAT

02:30:54.211 --> 02:30:55.413
WHEN BENEFITS ARE TOO LOW.

02:30:55.479 --> 02:30:57.014
WORKERS LOOK AT THAT AGE TO SIDE

02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:58.816
I CAN'T LIVE ON THAT AND SO THEY

02:30:58.883 --> 02:31:00.117
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:01.318
THAT THEY'RE PAYING.

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:02.853
FOR AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF A

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:03.721
ONE TWO PUNCH IN AN INDUSTRY

02:31:03.788 --> 02:31:05.022
WHERE WORKERS HAVE TO GO OUT OF

02:31:05.089 --> 02:31:06.390
STATE A LOT WHERE.

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:08.592
THEY THEN ALSO DON'T HAVE TIME

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:09.560
TO BOND WITH CHILDREN IF THEY

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:11.195
HAVE KIDS OR TAKE CARE OF A

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:12.763
LOVED ONE IN ADDITION TO THE

02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:13.931
FACT THAT THEY'RE ALREADY BY

02:31:13.998 --> 02:31:15.199
DEFINITION HAVING TO SPEND A LOT

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.367
OF TIME OUT OF STATE.

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:18.035
AND SO IT'S PARTICULARLY UNFAIR

02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:19.437
TO LET THAT LACK OF CLARITY

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:21.372
CONTINUE IN THIS INDUSTRY AND WE

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:22.106
THINK GIVEN THE NARROW

02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:23.340
APPLICATION.

02:31:23.407 --> 02:31:24.875
AND THE FACT OF THAT ON THIS IS

02:31:24.942 --> 02:31:26.343
SOMETHING THAT WORKERS PAY INTO

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:27.745
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

02:31:27.812 --> 02:31:29.447
IT -- HOPEFULLY THE SOME OF THE

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:31.015
COMMITTEE CAN CONSERVE CAN

BEEN SEEING.

02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:11.541

LIGHTLY THAT.

02:44:34.564 --> 02:44:36.733
MAKING SURE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:38.201
ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS MORE

02:44:38.268 --> 02:44:40.203
IMPORTANT THAN A RIGHT TO

02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:42.872
PRIVACY FOR EXAMPLE I KEEP -- IS

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:45.208

AND THE THE LACK OF IT THE LACK

02:44:56.553 --> 02:44:58.755
OF CONCERN FOR THE EFFORT TO PUT

02:44:58.822 --> 02:45:00.557
OTHER RIGHTS FAR IN EXCESS OF IT

02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:02.659
THAT AREN'T EVEN RIGHTS AT ALL

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:05.929

WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT.

02:45:23.647 --> 02:45:25.715
EXTENSIVELY IN THE COMMITTEE IN

02:45:25.782 --> 02:45:27.117
JUDICIARY AS OF LATE.

02:45:27.183 --> 02:45:28.818
I I WASN'T ANTICIPATING THIS

02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:31.221
BEING THE VENUE TO HAVE THE THE

02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:35.025
DATA PRIVACY.

02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:36.960

02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:38.728
I WAS TRYING TO TACKLE THE OTHER

ISSUES AROUND.

02:45:40.363 --> 02:45:43.233
THE SOCIAL BENEFITS AND COSTS OF

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:44.501
INNOVATION.

02:45:44.567 --> 02:45:46.936
I ACTUALLY AM VERY INTERESTED IN.

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:49.072
TRYING TO PUT SOME KIND OF REAL

02:45:49.139 --> 02:45:51.107
REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:53.243

ENFORCE OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS --

02:45:55.078 --> 02:45:56.279
AND I THINK THERE'S THERE'S

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:57.747
SOMETHING MUCH MORE NEAR TERM
