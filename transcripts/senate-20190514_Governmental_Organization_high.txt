THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TROUBLE MEMBERS. TRY BUSINESSES INCLUDE ARBOR MANY MARK. AL UTILITIES DISTRICT. THEY ONE ALDEN IN MOTEL CASINO. UBER FORCE INDUSTRIES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE CRUCIAL TO THE TRIBES ECONOMY AS A PROVIDE GOOD SERVICES. AND JOBS TO THE COMMUNITY. TO ENSURE THAT LOOK AMERICAN SINGLE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES. SB SIX SEVENTY FOUR CODIFIES EXISTING COMPACT THAT THE VALLEY TRIBE AGREED UPON WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. TODAY THE WHO REALLY TRIBE IS DRIVING WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TRIBAL MEMBERS. THE TRIBE OWNS SEVERAL ENTERPRISES THAT OPERATE ON THE RESERVATION. INCLUDING LUCKY BEAR CASINO. ALL ACT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE VALLEY'S ECONOMY. THE CASINO CURRENTLY OPERATES BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED THIRTY MACHINES ON THE GAMING. FOR AND HAS TWENTY EMPLOYEES TWO OF WHICH ARE WHO PUT TRAVEL MEMBERS. THE LAST CONTACT WAS RATIFIED IN SEPTEMBER. NINETEEN NINETY NINE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TRIBES CONTACT WAS BRIEF UPON WITH GOVERNOR BROWN. THIS BILL COMBAT CODIFIES THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TRAVEL COMPACT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND VALLEY TRIBE. SO THEY CAN OPERATE THE LUCKY BEAR CASINO.

THE COMPACT INCLUDES UPDATED PROVISIONS FOR LICENSING COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT. MEDICATION OF OFFERS A VISION IMPACTS. PROTECTIONS FOR PATRONS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE. CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RECENT CONTACTS. BECAUSE THE TRIBES LANDS ARE EXTREMELY REMOTE. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO OFFERS VACATION IMPACT OF THE TRIBE'S CASINO. THIS COMPACT AMENDMENT WILL ALLOW THE TRIBE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE A SMALL GAMING FACILITY. FOR ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE STATE HAS AGREED TO WAIVE THE COST OF REGULATORY FEES TO THE STATE FOR FIVE YEARS. IS A LUCKY BEAR CASINO SO SMALL AND IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE TRIBE AGREED. UPDATE THE REGULATORY PROVISIONS FROM THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACT. IS OUR HOPE THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LAST YEAR THAT WE WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY REGULATORY COSTS IN THE FUTURE. INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UPDATED REGULATORY-PROVISIONS I HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CASINO REVENUES WHICH PROVIDE JOBS TO TRIBAL MEMBERS. THE STATE RECOGNIZE THE TRIBE SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY REGULATORY COSTS IN LIGHT OF THE BURDEN WOULD HAVE ON THE TRIBE. AND IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE TRIBE DID NOT PAY SUCH COSTS. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. THE TRIBES REGULATORY ABILITY HAS PROVEN TO BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO ENSURE THAT THE GAMING FACILITY. IS OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC SAFETY AND INSURERS INTEGRITY OF THE GAMING CONDUCTED THERE AND YOUR PLEASE A GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND HIS NEW TRAVEL NEGOTIATOR AND A NAY MARK.

IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHICH ENABLE THE TRIBES TO REVENUES% GENERATED BY ITS CASINO TO SUPPORT A STRONG SELF SUFFICIENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. AND TO FIND ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO TRIBAL CITIZENS. IN LIGHT OF THAT OF THE UPCOMING BROWN ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED A NEW CONTACT WITH THE WHO BUT DR. IT'S COMPACT SUPPORTS TRIBAL IN STATE INTERESTS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT COMPACTS RATIFIED BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO THE NEWSMEN MINISTER. ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS ITS RATIFICATION. THE ECONOMIC PROVISIONS ALLOW FOR THE TRIBE TO OPERATE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE GAMING DEVICES IN UP TO TWO FACILITIES. CONTACT REQUIRES A TRIED TO PAY ITS PRO RATA SHARE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND COSTS THOSE WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL -- TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND AS THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED -- UNDER THE AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN I THINK IS -- THERE IS DISCRETION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO HAVE THEM NOT PAY THAT AT ALL IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE STF. I'M SO THAT GIVES SOME SORT OF BUFFER SPACE FOR THAT. AT THE TOP OF THE TRIBE IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUNDING WINSTEAD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAYMENTS UNDER THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUND. THE OTHER CORE PROVISIONS OF THE COMPACT INCLUDING TERMS RELATED TO LICENSING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR T THOSE AND OTHER CONTACTS NEGOTIATED BY THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION. TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS INCLUDES PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROVISIONS TO ADOPT TO COMPLY WITH A FAIRLY VERSUS FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT.

COMPAQ'S TERM IS TWENTY FIVE YEARS UNLIKE THE NINETY NINE WHICH IS -- TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] AND TASTIC [inaudible] MISTER GRIFFIN. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACK RIBBON I REPRESENT UNITE HERE THE HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS UNION. THAT IS RECENTLY -- SURPASSES. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS MARK IN IT AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. WE'RE ALSO PROUD OF THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION. THAT PIVOTED AWAY FROM THE FOR ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THAT AND DECIDED NOT TO TRY TO FIND. PART OF THE GENERAL BUDGET THE GENERAL -- FIND. THROUGH TRIBAL GAMING -- AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRIBES WHATEVER MONIES THEY BRINGING SHOULD BE THEIR MONEY. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THOUGH WE ALSO ENJOYED THE FACT -- AND APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT -- GOVERNOR BROWN. TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE WORKERS WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE OWNER TRIED. AND ENSURED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHTS. TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. AND JOIN A UNION SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO DO THAT AT SOME POINT. AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE THOUGHT WAS SINCE THEY ARE THE ENGINE BEHIND THIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S GROWN QUITE LARGE. THAT THAT WAS ALSO A VERY VERY -- ADMIRABLE THING FOR THE LAST GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION TO DO AND WE ARE NOW PLEASE THAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. SEEMS TO BE I'M INTERESTED IN TAKING THE SAME COURSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER RAYMOND -- FROM MY STANDPOINT A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF ALREADY BEEN ASKED ANSWERED ANY MEMBERS -- WHEN YOU DRESS ANY ISSUE? I JUST WANT. TO CENTER RUBIO PLEASE. I THINK I MISSED THAT HE SAID THAT AROUND A SHARE IS GONNA BE LATE. YES THAT'S CORRECT. I JUST. YEAH I KNOW IT'S IF IT'S IF IT'S HELPFUL CLARIFICATION IT'S A BIT SORT OF CONFUSING BECAUSE I'M THE CONTACTED DOES PROVIDE FOR PRO RATA SHARE. BUT RECOGNIZING THE SIZE OF THE CASINO AND WANTING TO ENSURE THAT -- ANY FUNDS FROM THE CASINO GO BACK TO THE TRIBE AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THEY BECAUSE THIS THERE'S THIS SORT OF THE A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN WHICH ALLOWS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO REDUCE OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE PAYMENTS FOR LIMITED GAMING TRIBES. AND I THINK WHAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY SORT OF PUT THE THE DELAYED TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE INTO THE COMPACT. SO THERE WOULD BE SOME TIME TO KIND OF WORK THAT ALL OUT AND THE FOR THE TRIBE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ANY AS THE F. FUND SO IT WOULDN'T BE JUST SORT OF A A CLIFF FOR SUDDENLY THEY HAD TO PAY A NEW FEES THAT THEY DIDN'T. SERENA. THERE ARE TWO A YES. THANK YOU CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE WORK YOU DO I SEE THAT THAT THAT THAT -- THE TRIBE HAS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND ROLLED MEMBERS A LOS TRIBE MEMBERS OF THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS HOUSE AT NUMBER. THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED OTHERS ARE ALL TRIBAL MEMBERS YEAH ALL PRIVATE MEMBERS. AND AND ALSO I I ALSO SEE THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO GO BACK INTO NOT ONLY THE CASINO BUT INTO THE COMMUNITY -- TO TAKE CARE OF COURSE THE TRIBAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING EDUCATIONAL HEAD START PROGRAM AND SOME OF THE OTHER. COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT YOU GET BACK IN YOUR LIFE ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU GIVE BACK. TO YOUR OWN COMMUNITY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE OUTSIDE COMMUNITY. SURE I WOULD I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT -- THE VALLEY TRIBE IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SELF GOVERNANCE TRIBES OF FORMED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT UNDER THE INDIAN SELF DETERMINATION AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT. DAN LOUDEST -- TO CONTACT WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVING A FAIR SPECIFICALLY. ALL THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS THAT -- WERE REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF TREATIES ARE SIGNED IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. OF FROM THAT POINT ON UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN THE TRIBES OF POSSIBILITIES PROVIDE. OF ALL THE SERVICES THAT -- FOLKS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE LAW YOU OFFER THE RESERVATION SO I COULD MENTION BEFORE. I EDUCATION IS ONE AREA WE O FIND A LOT OF THE SCHOLARSHIPS AND AND GRANT AWARDS FOR FOR STUDENTS -- WE COME IN A LOT OF THE MONEY INTO OUR RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS -- DIVERSION OR OTHERWISE OF FOR OUR YOUTH. ARE THERE OTHER NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS THAT WE ALSO -- SPAN AND COMMIT OUR DOLLARS -- TO ACROSS THE BOARD SOCIAL SERVICES -- I WAS ALSO -- YOU KNOW. IN WHICH THE FUNDS ARE USED TO HELP AGREE MORE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FORCE AS WELL SO. WE TRIED -- TO SPREAD AROUND AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO TRY AN IMPACT -- MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS ON THE RESERVATION. AS FAR AS IMPACTS TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE -- NOT A PART OF THE TRIBE IF YOU WILL BUT ARE THE OVERALL. COMMUNITY WE'RE VERY INCLUSIVE OF EVERYONE WHO'S THERE -- OBVIOUSLY IF IF YOU'RE NOT A TRIBAL MEMBER NOT NECESSARILY ENTITLED AS SOME OF THE SERVICES OR BENEFITS THAT WE DO PROVIDE. A MORE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IS OPEN TO ANYONE WHO. YOU KNOW NEEDS ANY KIND OF ASSISTANCE AND IN THAT WAY SO. WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TOO MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON ON THE COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF US AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE AND WE WILL TRY TO REMEDY THAT IF THERE WERE ANY ISSUES THAT THAT DID ARISE. THE IMPACTED YOU IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OUTSIDE WOULD BE THE EMPLOYMENT. OF OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE ABLE TO BE. PART OF THE ORGANIZATION AS FAR AS EMPLOYEES. THERE'S THAT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TOURISM AS WELL FOLKS THAT DO COME IN YOU KNOW WHAT WE LIVE FOR THEM TO FRIEDMAN ARE STATUS MEN AND ENJOYING THE VALLEY IS AS WE DO AS WELL. FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS IS REAPING THE WILL ROARED SHOULD OBVIOUSLY. FROM THE CASINO AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYEES BEING ABLE. TO OF LIVE AROUND THE COMMUNITY AND AND BY HOMES AND PARTICIPATE IN. AND THE THINGS THAT THEY DO -- ON THEIR DAILY LIVES SHOPPING AND AND JUST BEING -- A WELL OF ORGANIZING MANAGE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU ARE THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE A STABLE INCOME. ABLE JOBS FOR THE FUTURE AND SO ON AS WELL ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE I'M MY NAME'S PAIN I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE HELP OF VALLEY TRIBE AND I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE CLARIFY WHEN. ONE POINT FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF THE CONTACTS THAT COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN ARE LARGE GAMING TRIBES THAT HAVE MAYBE SMALL TRIBAL LANDS. AND YOU KNOW THAT ARE WITHIN A LARGER COMMUNITY BUT THEY HAVE A VALLEY TRIBE THEY'RE EXTREMELY RURAL AND THE RENT THE RESERVATION AREA IS VERY LARGE. AND SO THE WHO THE LUCKY BEAR CASINO IS A VERY SMALL FACILITY HAS. USUALLY UNDER A HUNDRED MACHINES AND IT IS JUST REALLY ADD UP AN AMENITY THAT IS IN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY WITHIN THE RESERVATION IT DOES PROVIDE LIMITED NUMBER OF JOBS TO TRIBAL MEMBERS. AS A IT REALLY. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A AN OFF RESERVATION IMPACT FROM THE CASINO BECAUSE THE DISTANCES SO GREAT. SO -- IT IS UNUSUAL IN THAT SENSE AND I THINK THAT AS I WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE GOING FORWARD MANY OF THIS THESE CONTACTS FOR LIMITED GAMING TRIBES THAT HAVE FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MACHINES. THEY WILL BE THAT KIND OF TRIBE WHERE THEY HAVE LESS OF AN INTERACTION WITH THE LOCAL. BECAUSE THEIR SELF CONTAINED AND SELF GOVERNED I'M AND BUT DO CONTINUE TO HAVE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE COUNTY. OF THE STATE AND I AM THE CASINO REALLY ISN'T THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF THE TRIBE. BUT IT PROVIDED NO JOBS TO THE TRIBAL MEMBERS AND OTHERS THAT WANT TO WORK THERE. THANK YOU FOR SHARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS POINT TIME WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANY BODY WISHING TO COMMENT ON THIS COMPACT SEEING NONE. THAT COMPLETES THE THE THE HEARING -- FOR YOU WE APPRECIATE THIS THIS WILL AS I SAID EARLIER -- WILL END UP -- BACK IN THE SENATE -- FOR OR APPROVAL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING MISTER CHAIRMAN. NOW WILL BEGIN THE THE COMPACT HEARING FOR THE SUSANVILLE INDIAN RANCHERIA. AND WE'LL START WITH YOU. THEY MARK [inaudible] HELLO AGAIN. OF AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME. AND AS WITH THE THE WHO THE CONTACTS THE TRIBE IN THE STATE ENTERED INTO A TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS. IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHICH SIMILARLY TO WHO BY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR REPEATING MYSELF BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING -- THROUGH REVENUES GENERATED BY ITS THE SCENE NO SUPPORTS A STRONG SELF SUFFICIENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND FUNDS ESSENTIAL SERVICES -- TRIBAL CITIZENS. IN LIGHT OF THIS OF THE UPCOMING EXPIRATION OF THAT CONTACT THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT WITH THE SUSANVILLE TRIBE. IS COMPLEX IMPORTS TRIBAL AND STATE INTERESTS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH RECENT CONTACTS RATIFIED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND SO THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS ITS RATIFICATION. THE ECONOMIC PROVISIONS ALLOW FOR THE TRIBE TO OPERATE UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED GAMING DEVICES IN UP TO TWO FACILITIES. COME BACK REQUIRES THE TRIBE PAYSPRO RATA SHARE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND COSTS. THE TRIBE IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND BUT IF IT DECIDES TO GO ABOVE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE DEVICES. IT WILL NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED A LMITED GAMING TRIBE AND IT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND OR THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUNDS. OTHER CORE PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE PROVISIONS I DESCRIBED EARLIER IN WHO BY INCLUDING TERMS REALLY TO LICENSING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY -- TERM ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. I HAD THE TRIBES HOTELS FREQUENTED BY HUNTERS -- SO THE SUSANVILLE COMPACT HAS A UNIQUE PROVISION THAT IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL PROHIBITION ON NON LAW ENFORCEMENT POSSESSION OF WEAPONS AT A GAMING FACILITY. IT ALLOWS OVERNIGHT GUESTS AT THE HOTEL TO TRANSPORT AND STORE UNLOADED WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION IN THEIR HOTEL ROOMS. SO THAT'S SORT OF THE BIG THE BIG UNIQUE THING WITH THIS COMPACT THAT'S WORTH NOTING -- IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS IS ALSO AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH THE TOURNAMENTS I WANNA AKE SURE ANYTHING -- WHEN BEAUVAIS?

THE TRIBE CURRENTLY OPERATES IS GIVEN FACILITY UNDER NINETEEN NINETY NINE TRAVEL STATE GAMING COMPACT. WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE IN. TWENTY TWENTY AB THIRTEEN THIRTY THREE WOULD ALLOW THE TRIBE.

YES OF COURSE -- TRIBES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY GAMING COULD COME FORWARD AND AND WANT TO NEGOTIATE CONTACTS AS WELL BUT ASSUMING THE ONLY THINGS THAT WERE NEGOTIATING -- BEFORE THE SORT OF DROP DEAD DATE OF I THINK IT'S JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXPIRATION. IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF AUTOMATIC EXT -- IN NEGOTIATIONS I BELIEVE THAT NUMBER IS THIRTY THREE YEAH. THE OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENT -- ONE IS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ROBERT JOSEPHINUM THE DISTRICT TO COUNCILMEMBER FOR THE CIVIL INDIAN RANCHERIA. OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLYREALLY WANT TO LOOK AT IS IS WE DONE A SURVEY FOR A FEW YEARS AGO ON WHAT WE PUT BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH OUR TAXES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WELL WE GOT ABOUT NINETY EMPLOYEES AND VERY LITTLE OR TRAVEL MEMBERS THERE -- SO A LOT OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES DO GO BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS HUGE. BUT I THINK MY BIGGEST THING IS IS WE DON'T GIVE PER CAPITA JUST LIKE HER TRAVEL CHARGER STATED. YOU KNOW WE PUT IT BACK IN EDUCATION. EDUCATION OUR OUR OUR GOAL IS YOU KNOW SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR TRAVEL MEMBERS. ARM WE HAVE BEEN IN I CALLED THIS MORNING JUST DOUBLE CHECK WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY PEOPLE AUTHOR RIGHT NOW THAT ARE THAT ARE IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAM. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WE HAVE A BOTTOM 95% SUCCESS RATE OF THOSE GUYS MOVING ON TO ME THAT'S HUGE. YOU KNOW ALL IN IN IN THE AND THAT'S WERE YOU KNOW OUR OUR MONEY GOES INTO -- THAT THE KIDS THE ELDERS IN IN ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANT TO PUT OUT IS. FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I SAW ON THE HOUSING BOARD AS WELL AS WE WENT AND BUILT A FOUR PLEX INSIDE THE CITY LIMITS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. YOU KNOW -- JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE. PLACES AND STUFF ON ON THE RESERVATION THAT WAS READY TO BUILD AND WE NEEDED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT QUIRK. SO REGIONAL SOME TO WITH THE TAXES AND STUFF AS WELL YOU KNOW -- I MYSELF SIGNED OVER THIRTY FIVE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PERMITS AND STUFF TO BUILD THIS. THE STOP FOUR PLEX SUNUNU'S WHILE YOU EITHER A LITTLE UNDER A LITTLE OVER AMILLION DOLLARS. BUT IT WAS FOR YOU KNOW OUR OUR YOUNGER GENERATION KIDS THAT ARE GOING TO SCHOOL THAT. DON'T -- MEET QUALIFICATIONS TO BE UP ON THE HILL WHERE WE HAVE A FOR SMALL FAMILIES AND WHAT. YOU ALSO TO MEET THAT WAS HUGE BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW I I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT IS THAT WE DON'T GIVE PER CAPITA OUT OF THIS. IN IN OUR CASINOS NOT GOING TO BE GETTING ANY BIGGER BECAUSE WE DID DO A SURVEY. IT ALL -- BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY EIGHTY MILES FROM RENO NEVADA. YOU KNOW SO WE'RE JUST KEEPING THIS ALL LOCAL. ARM. IT ALSO SO AGAIN YOU KNOW I'VE I THINK MY BIGGEST THING IS IS WHAT I SAID ON THE TRIBAL COUNCIL IS IS YOU KNOW SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR MEMBERS. ON IN EDUCATION YOU JUST CAN'T GO WRONG AND EDUCATION. SO THAT'S JUST ONE LECTURES ON THE THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC. COMMENT. THERE ARE TWO LETTERS THE QUESTION HOUSING YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE BUILDING A FOUR PLEX OUTSIDE THE RESERVATION IN THE COMMUNITY. IS THAT FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS TO LIVE THERE OR THAT OPEN. THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS. OKAY THANK YOU. AND THAT IS ON THAT IS ON FEE LAND. WE WEREN'T WE WILL NEVER PUT THAT LAND INTO. TRUST THAT IS WE PAY THE TAXES ON IT YOU KNOW AND DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE COMMUNITY. GOOD WELL THAT CONCLUDES -- THIS PORTION OF THE COMPACT HEARING THIS NAME MARK THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- MR RUBIN THANK YOU AND CHAIR WOMAN FEEL BETTER. THIS. MEETING IS ADJOURNED YOUR
