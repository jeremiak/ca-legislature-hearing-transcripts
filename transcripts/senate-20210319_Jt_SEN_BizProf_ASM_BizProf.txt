PROFESSIONALLY I AM A LICENSED CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND THE MANAGING PARTNER OF THE HANSON BRIDGET HOPPER AND I AM A FORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY OF THE- CHARGED WITH PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS.

AND WE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION CALIFORNIA IS SPECIAL WORKERS FOR THEIR WORK ON OUR COLLECTIVE BEHALF. WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS CRITICAL TO THE BOARD MISSION TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE CONSUMER.

THEY SENT THAT REVIEW PROCESS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BOARD AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OP. TO DISCUSS THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH YOU I THINK HERE FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE DEDICATED TO MOVING THE MEDICAL BOARD FORWARD TO ADVANCE ITS MISSION AND TO BUILD TRUST WITH THE PUBLIC. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES- THE MEDICAL BOARD VICE PRESIDENT DR HOWARD CRAP. THANK YOU MS LAWSON FOR YOUR SERVICE WELCOME DOCTOR CROSS. GOOD MORNING- IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DURING MY TENURE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD SINCE AUGUST TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. I WILL BE TURNED OUT ON JUNE ONE. AFTER RECEIVING MY MASTERS IN AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS AT MIT. I BECAME A SYSTEMS ENGINEER WITH THE HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES. ENGAGED IN THE DESIGN OF MISSILES SATELLITES AND SPACECRAFT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. SEEKING A MORE HUMANISTIC CAREER I LEFT FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL. RECEIVING MY HANDY AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN. AND THEN PURSUED FIVE YEARS OF POSTGRADUATE EDUCATION SINCE WHICH TIME I HAVE SPECIALIZED IN SURGICAL NEURO OPHTHALMOLOGY. ENGAGED IN THE EVALUATION- AND MEDICAL AND SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGIC. BRAIN FACIAL AN ORBITAL DISORDERS WHICH AFFECT VISION. I'M A PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON A RESEARCHER AND MEDICAL OFF THERE AND CONTINUE TO TEACH AT UCLA WHERE AM CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF OPHTHALMOLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY. ONE OF MY MOST IMPORTANT AND HUMBLING EXPERIENCES BEGAN IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OFFERING THIS APPOINTMENT. BUT OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS I HAVE LEARNED THAT ROCKET SCIENCE AND BRAIN SURGERY ARE EASIER THAN SERVING ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE I HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO PATIENTS FAMILIES STAFF STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES. SAYING THANK YOU. I ENJOYED MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH COLLEAGUES AND STAFF OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. BUT SELDOM RECEIVED THANK YOUS FROM PHYSICIANS AT LARGE OR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO APPEAR OR CALL AND WORK MEETINGS. IN MANY REGARDS IT'S BEEN A THANKLESS TASK BUT I HAVE PERSISTED BECAUSE I KNOW THE VALUE OF THIS SPORT. I KNOW THAT DESPITE THE FAILURES WHICH MAY BE HIGHLIGHTED THE TIMES. THAT THIS BOARD IS COMMITTED AND DEDICATED TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC ABOVE ALL ELSE. AS SUCH THE SEVEN YEARS OF TRUE PUBLIC SERVICE. WILL CONTINUE TO BE VALUED BY ME AS A TIME OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE KNOWING THAT I AND MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS ARE DEDICATED BOARD EXECUTIVES AND STAFF AND OUR DEDICATED COLLEAGUES IN THE AG'S OFFICE. AND IN THE DCA HAVE LABORED LONG AND HARD. IN BEHALF OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH PRESIDENT LAWSON. THE CONSUMER PROTECTION WAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND OUR MEMBERS AND STAFF ARE DEDICATED TO THAT MISSION. TODAY I PERSONALLY ASK FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE. MORE HOPES TO ENACT MULTIPLE CHANGES TO THE BOARD STATUTES INCLUDING SOME ADDITIONAL STATUTORY ENHANCEMENTS THAT SUPPORT ITS ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. I BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD'S PROPOSALS AND OUR SUNSET REPORT WILL LEAD TO INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE BOARD AND ITS INVESTIGATORS WORK ON THE BOARDS MOST CRITICAL CASES INCLUDING THOSE THAT INVOLVE NEGLIGENT OR INCOMPETENT QUALITY OF CARE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND OTHER SERIOUS MATTERS. THE BOARD APPRECIATES INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND WAYS TO ADMINISTER OUR LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR BOARD'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MISTER WILLIAM PROCEEDS GO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR MISTER PACIFICA. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SENATE STAND IT YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF YOUR LEADERSHIP STAFF AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS JOINING US TODAY AS WELL. YES SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE I'M HERE WITH MY SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM. WILL BE ASSISTING ME AND ANSWERING ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS I HAVE A PRESENTATION I WILL. THANKFULLY BE BRIEF BUT SIMPLY TO HIGHLIGHT SOME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AS THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT HAVE VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED. THAT THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS IS AT THE VERY HEART. OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND AS A REGULATOR. WHO HAS HAD EXPERIENCE IN A VARIETY OF REGULATE READ THE FARES. CAN I TELL YOU THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THE MEDICAL BOARDOF CALIFORNIA. VALUES CONSUMER PROTECTION AS IT'S ABSOLUTELY HIGHEST PRIORITY. IN TERMS OF AN OVERVIEW OF ENFORCEMENT. I WELCOME THE FACT THAT TO DATE WE ARE TALKING ONLY ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE AS IS QUITE APPARENT IN FORSMAN IS THE LARGEST FUNCTION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD LITERALLY 80% OF OUR RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED. TO ENFORCEMENT SO IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT WE FOCUS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF OUR STATUTORY MISSION. I KNOW ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT ARE THE TIMES THAT IT TAKES TO BRING ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION AND TAKE A COMPLAINT THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE CHART HERE DEMONSTRATE WHAT THOSE TIME FRAMES ARE CHARGING OUT FROM THE TIME IN WHICH ALL INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED INTERNALLY IN THE BOARD- UP TILL- FISCAL YEAR THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND THEN AFTER THERE WAS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE SWORN AND THE NON SWORN- INVESTIGATIONS. ARE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASING TIME FRAMES FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MEDICAL BOARDS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE CASES ARE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX MORE LITIGIOUS AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO FACE. UP TO IS THE FACT THAT THE TIME FRAMES IN TERMS OF THE SWORN INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO RISE DR BOTH OR- MR PACIFICO BEFORE YOU LEAVE THAT CHART I NORMALLY DON'T DO THIS BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL SAVE SOME TIME HERE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT CHART MEANS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ALL CASES- THE R. I. C. YEARS AS AN ORANGE LINE YARNS LINE OF THOSE THE COMPLEX CASES THOSE ARE THE CASES THAT GO TO THE SWORN SITE WHICH TEND TO BE THE MORE COMPLICATED CASES. ABSOLUTELY AND THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN TIME IN RECENT YEARS. THE LESS COMPLEX CASES ON THE NON SWORN SIDE WE HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN TERMS OF GETTING THE TIME FRAMES DOWN. ON THIS THE END OF BEFORE I GO TO MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR PAN AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TIME FROM RECEIPT OF COMPLAINT. TO COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION. YES THAT'S CORRECT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MOVE FROM COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION TO RESOLUTION BUT LET ME GO TO DOCTOR PAN CENTER PAM ACTUALLY IT'S- BY SHE HEARS AT LEAST SITTING FROM HERE WITH- GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE PRINCE AND WHERE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ITS VERY HEART WHICH I CNNOT SEE THE LEGENDS IN THE GRAPH SO I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE MORE EXPLANATION OF FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE COLOR LINES ACTUALLY MEAN BECAUSE IN THE FRENCH. POLICE I DON'T KNOW FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHERE I'M SITTING I HEART IT'S ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO THANKS IF WE HAVE A COPY OF THE PRINT THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU. YOU WOULD LIKE A FULLER EXPLANATION NOW WHICH YOU. OF THE CHAIRS PROVIDED ME A COPY OF THE SLIDES AND JUST ALLOWS ME TO ACTUALLY READ WHAT'S ON THE SLIDES- I DON'T KNOW IF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION OR NOT. BUT WE'LL TRY TO GET THE COPIES OF THAT OF. FOR THE COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE ROOM AS SOON THOSE ON THE SCREEN CAN. HAVE A BETTER VIEW THOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SO. WE'LL TRY TO DO THAT DOCTOR DOCTOR PAN ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BASED ON. OKAY SIR I'M SORRY TO HAVE INTERRUPTED BUT I THOUGHT WE MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT EITHER WAY PLEASE PROCEED THAT'S FINE OKAY GOING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE LOOK AT THE OVERALL STATISTICS THE STATISTICS FOR COMPLAINTS RECEIVED. THIS IS A VERY FAMILIAR- STATISTIC FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOW US CLOSELY WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING ON THE ORDER OF TEN TO ELEVEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS- EVERY YEAR. AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THERE'S A FAIRLY LARGE CONSISTENCY THAT WERE IN THE- THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED- THE RATE CATEGORY. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT. IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL CONTEXT. IT FINDS OUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD IS IF YOU WILL SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE IN THE TERMS OF NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES. I CASES PER M. D.'S- THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE. IS TO FOCUS ON THAT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. THAT AT A RELATIVELY EARLY PART OF THE PROCESS- ARE CLOSED OUT FOR AS IT SAYS THEY'RE INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE NO VIOLATION ARE NO JURISDICTION. SOMETIMES WE GET LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME INCIDENT. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ONY ONE INCIDENT THERE'S EFFECTIVELY ONLY WANT A COMPLAINANT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THE MEDICAL BOARD TO OPERATE SOMETIMES THIS CAN SEEM A BIT STARTLING. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED IN OTHER AREAS IT'S A- IT'S A FINAL IT'S A FRAMEWORK WHICH IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. THERE ARE MANY CASES THAT WE RECEIVED. THAT DO NOT RAISE ISSUES OF FITNESS TO PRACTISE AND WHAT IS NEEDED IN A REGULATORY SYSTEM IS THE AGILITY. TO DEAL WITH THOSE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY SO THAT ON THE LESSER NUMBER IS A VERY SERIOUS CASES WE HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES. TO DEAL WITH THEM IN A COMPREHENSIVE FASHION. WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS TO HIGHLIGHT WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD SEES SAYS SOME OF THE DRIVERS IN RELATION TO THE TIMELINES AND RESOURCES THAT IT TAKES IN ORDER TO BRING A COMPLAINT THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS ONE THING WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE OPERATE UNDER A VERY HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF IN ORDER TO GET SUBSTANTIAL DISCIPLINE THE CASE MUST BE PROVEN. ACCORDING TO CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WERE HELD O. IT BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND IT IS A HEAVY BURDEN BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS SANCTION THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS MATTER AS WELL. THEOTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THE LEGISLATION. REQUIRES THAT IN TERMS OF FRAMING A SANCTION. YES WE LOOK AT PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND THAT IS THE PRIMARY. OBJECT THE PRIMARY GOAL WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT. BUT WE ARE ALSO DIRECTED TO LOOK AT ISSUES OF REHABILITATION AND PRACTICE RESTRICTIONS WHICH WOULD ALLOW A DOCTOR TO REMAIN IN PRACTICE. PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN REMEDIATION OUR PRACTICE RESTRICTIONS FROM SOME QUARTERS THERE SEEMS TO BE A DRIVE PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY. THAT MOST- TIMES THERE IS A FINDING A TRADE GROUP RESULT IN REVOCATION THAT IS NOT WHAT THE LEGISLATION DIRECTS US TO DO ALTHOUGH IT DOES RECOGNIZE THAT REPLICATION IS NECESSARY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS A DRIVER IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENTIS THE INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN THAT EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEMENT. CURRENTLY IS DIVIDED AMONG THREE SEPARATE BODIES OURSELVES THE MEDICAL BOARD THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATIVE UNIT IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THIS IS I THANK AN UNUSUAL CONFIGURATION COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES AND IT DOES PRESENT CERTAIN CHALLENGES WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT- THE OTHER DRIVER- THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING AND UNDERSTANDING WHY IT TAKES SO LONG. WHAT SOMETIMES IS SO COSTLY TO BRING A COMPLAINT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS IS THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW A VERY CUMBERSOME LEGAL PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES MOST CASES BEFORE ANY SERIOUS SANCTION CAN BE. CONSIDERED TO GO TO ACCUSATIONS ACCUSATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IT REQUIRES THE ACTION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE PREPARING A VERY LENGTHY DOCUMENT WHICH IS NECESSARY BUT VERY COSTLY AND VERY TIME CONSUMING. WE HAVE SOMETIMES DIFFICULTY GETTING ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY RECORDS WE ALSO HAD DIFFICULTIES MAINTAINING OUR OBTAINING PATIENT RECORDS IN BOTH OF THESE THINGS CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING WHERE WE WANT TO INVESTIGATE IT TAKES SOMETIMES A LONG TIME TO ACTUALLY GET THE RECORDS. AND THE OTHER THING IN TERMS OF PROCESS IS THAT UNDER OUR CURRENT. STATUTE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS ON ANY NON ADVERSARIAL OPTIONS THAT WE MAY PURSUE. THERE IS A PUBLIC LETTER OF REGRET RECORD REPRIMAND BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE INVOKED IF IT'S AGREED BY THE OTHER PARTY AND IT'S PUBLISHED IN THE MUST BE TOO SIMPLE DEPARTURES. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR US IF WE HAVE A LENGTHY INVESTIGATION. AND IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS ONE SIMPLE DEPARTURE IN A SIMPLE DEPARTURE MAYBE SOMETHING WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT. BUT THEN WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE REGULATE RETOOL CAT IN WHICH WE CAN. BRING THE DOCTOR THROUGH SOME. SOME REPEAT REMEDIATION OUR REHABILITATION THERE'S LITERALLY NOTHING WE CAN DO. THERE IS A REFERENCE VERY BRIEFLY IN OUR STATUTE TO WARNING LETTERS BUT THEIR NON BINDING THEY'RE NOT DEFINED AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM THAT WE CAN RELATE RELY ON IN TERMS OF. HAVING A SERIOUS MEANS OF DEALING WITH A COMPLAINT. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FEW REFORMS WE ARE DEDICATED TO WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO WORKING MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IF THERE ARE CERTAIN REFORMS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFICIENTLY WE CAN BRING THE TIME LINES DOWN WILL HAVE MORE RESOURCES. TO FOCUS ON THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH REQUIRE OFTEN A VERY SERIOUS AND SEVERE SANCTIONS. THE FIRST IS TO CREATE WHAT WE HAVE DEEMED TO BE A LETTER OF ADVICE WHICH WOULD BE NON PUBLIC BUT BINDING. THESE WOULD BE FOR CASES WHERE FITNESS TO PRACTISE IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR REMEDIATION. WE NOTE THAT THRE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY ONE OTHER BOARDS WITH THE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE SUCH A POWER. I KNOW THAT INTERNATIONALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD IS MOVING TOWARDS A FOCUS ON NON ADVERSARIAL MEANS OF RESOLUTION FOR THE VAST BULK. OFTHE COMPLAINTS AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS NEEDED VERY MUCH AS AN OPTION FOR US AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL. AS WE'VE ALSO STATED IN OUR SUNSET PAPER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE THINK. ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY WOULD ALLOW US TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY OBTAIN THE RECORDS THAT ARE SO VITAL FOR US IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO THAT WE CAN INVESTIGATE CASES IN SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME THEIR CONSIDERATION. IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM WE THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR GREATER ENGAGEMENT. BETWEEN OURSELVES THE MEDICAL BOARD IN THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATIVE UNIT WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO DO THAT WE ARE UPDATING THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES THERE IS GOOD WILL ON BOTH SIDES. BOTH SIDES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO- TO DEAL WITH THESE CASES MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO WORKING TOGETHER PARTICULARLY TO BRING THE TIME LINES DOWN AND TO PRIORITIZE. SO THAT WERE USING MOST RESOURCES AGAINST THE MOST IMPORTANT CASES. AND RELATED TO THAT WE SEE THAT THERE WILL BE A NEED AT SOME POINT IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM TO BEGIN TO CONSIDER MOVING INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. FROM THE SWORN TO THE NON SWORN SIDE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SCOPE AGAIN. TO RESOLVE A LOT OF THE LAST SERIOUS CASES MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFICIENTLY IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. IN THE GOAL HERE IS AGAIN TO FREE UP THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH A VERY SERIOUS CASE. FINALLY I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS SOME INTEREST. IN THE SANCTIONING POLICY OF THE MEDICAL BOARDS WE HAVE SANCTIONING GUIDELINES AND AS TO HOW THEY ARE USED TO THE CONCERN THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE NOT FOLLOWED APPROPRIATELY. WILL BE HAPPY. VOIGTS THE GUIDELINES OUR GUIDELINES ONLY THEY'RE MEANT THERE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE BOARD THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY IN EVERY SINGLE CASE. AND MANY TIMES THE GUIDANCE ITSELF IS EXPRESSED AS A SPECTRUM. ARE OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SANCTIONS. SETTLEMENT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH COMPLAINTS IT IS ACTUALLY MANDATED THAT WE CONSIDER SETTLEMENTS IN LAW AS PART OF THE PROCESS. AND THAT THE SETTLEMENT IS. OFTEN A VERY ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO FULFILL. OUR MISSION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. IF WE CAN IDENTIFY F. A SETTLEMENT WHICH PROTECTS THE PUBLIC IT DOES SO QUICKLY IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND WITH CERTAINTY. IT IS THE GUIDANCE IS. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CASE HAVE BEEN PROVEN. AND THAT THERE ARE NO WITNESSES IN THE CASE IN THE REAL WORLD AFTER AN INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED. AFTER THE RESPONDENT THE LICENSEE HAS HAD A FULL OPPORTUNITY TO STATE THEIR CASE SOMETIMES THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS SO BLACK AND WHITE SOMETIMES THE EXPERT WITNESSES ON THE OTHER SIDE. ARE VERY PERSUASIVE WE MUST TAKE ALL OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT SOMETIMES WITNESSES DO NOT SAY WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED THAT THEY WOULD SAY. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF FAIRNESS. IN THE CONTEXT OF PURSUING THE PUBLIC INTEREST SETTLEMENTS ARE OFTEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND VERY PRODUCTIVE BUT ALWAYS THEY ARE DONE WITH THE NOTION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION AT THE ABSOLUTE PRIORITY AND WE HAVE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE SETTLEMENTS CAN GO BEFORE THE BOARD BOARD MEMBERS CAN RAISE QUESTIONS THEY CAN- THEY CAN OBJECT. THOSE OBJECTIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN IT IS FREQUENTLY THE CASE. THAT THE SETTLEMENTS ARE SET ASIDE AND PROPOSED DECISIONS ARE SET ASIDE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION UPON BOARD DIRECTION WE WELCOME THAT WE WELCOME CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ALL SETTLEMENTS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WE LISTEN TO THEIR ADVICE THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE DECISION IS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND I AM. BOB AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT PROCEDUES IN PLACE SO THAT OTHER VIEWPOINTS CRITICAL VIEWPOINTS CAN BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THAT'S THE END OF MY FORMAL PRESENTATION AND MYSELF THE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT AND OUR SENIOR STAFF HERE. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR PACIFICO- IS- IS KATHLEEN NICHOLS GOING TO BE ADDRESSING US AS WELL. YES THANK YOU A MISS NICHOLS YOU ARE THE DEPUTY CHIEF FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DIVISION OF. INVESTIGATION HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION UNIT FIVE CORRECT. YES GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S KATHLEEN NICHOLS I AM THE DEPUTY CHIEF FOR THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION UNIT ALSO REFERRED TO AS H. YOU ARE YOU AT THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. I MUST WARN PEACE OFFICER WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF INVESTIGATION EXPERIENCE WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THE AGE YOU ARE YOU ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF EIGHT SHORT YEARS AND BEST TO GET A PROCESS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER IN JULY TWENTY FOURTEEN ALSO ONE INVESTIGATORS AND SUPPORT STAFF WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DCAS DIVISION UP INVESTIGATION. THE BOARD SUNSET BILL AT THE TIME SB THREE OH FOUR CREATED THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION UNIT AT THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. H. YOU ARE YEAR IS COME. OF NINETY SEVEN SWORN POSITIONS WHICH INCLUDES SEVENTY NINE SWORN INVESTIGATORS. AND EIGHTEEN SWORN SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS WHO INVESTIGATE AND SUPERVISED CASES FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD PODIATRY BOARD AND THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT WORK. EACH YEAR YOU ALSO EMPLOYS THIRTY THREE PART TIME MEDICAL CONSULTANTS WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE INVESTIGATORS. TO PROVIDE MEDICAL EXPERTISE AND REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE GATHERED INVESTIGATION. WHAT TWELVE FIELD OFFICES LOCATED STATEWIDE INVESTIGATORS RECEIVE REFERRALS FROM THE BOARDSAND INVESTIGATE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND PENAL CODE. BEFORE TWENTY NINETEEN PURSUANT TO LAW THE MEDICAL BOARD UTILIZED A VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTION MODEL ALSO KNOWN AS B. E. FOR THE PROGRAMS WITHIN DCA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS THE PROSECUTOR OF THE ENFORCEMENT CASES. ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE V. MODEL REQUIRED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TO BE INVOLVED IN THE MEDICAL BOARD'S INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE PROSECUTION ACTIVITIES. ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND H. SURE YOU INVESTIGATORS WERE JOINTLY ASSIGNED TO AN INVESTIGATION FROM THE OUTSET. THIS TEAM APPROACH WAS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE EARLY COORDINATION AND FASTER DECISIONS AND CASE FILINGS AS YOU MAY REMEMBER ME IT WAS DISCUSSED DURING THE BOARD LAST SUNSET REVIEW AND WAS ULTIMATELY REPEALED AND LAW. ALTHOUGH BE IT WAS REPEALED THERE ARE CASES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC WHERE THE MEDICAL BOARD OR H. DO YOU ARE YOU WILL REQUEST FOR THE CASE TO BE WORK JOINT. TOGETHER IN THESE CASES THE H. FOUR U. INVESTIGATOR WORKS WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE EXPEDITIOUSLY IN ORDER TO GATHER EVIDENCE TO REQUEST A SUSPENSION ORDER. SINCE THE ELIMINATION OF ME AND TWENTY NINETEEN ONCE A CASE IS REFERRED TO ENSURE YOU FOR INVESTIGATION BY THE BOARD INVESTIGATORS INTERVIEWED THE COMPLAINANT AND WITNESSES OBTAIN CERTIFIED MEDICAL RECORDS AND OTHER EVIDENCE. SOME CASE TYPES REQUIRE DRAFTING SUBPOENAS FOR RECORDS OBTAINING URINE SAMPLES FOR DRUG TOXICOLOGY SCREENS STUDY NOT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A SESSION IS SAFE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. CONDUCTING PHARMACY AUDITS UNDER COVER OPERATIONS. AND ISSUING SEARCH WARRANTS. AFTERTHE END IN FOR IS JUST. ALL EVER IS A BY DISTRICT MEDICAL CONSULTANT PHYSICIAN WHO WORKS IN THE FIELD OFFICES WITH THE INVESTIGATORS AND WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT FOR THE INTERVIEW OF THE SUBJECT POSITION. ONCE ALL THE EVIDENCE IS OBTAINED AND ALL THE INTERVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED THE CASES THEN REVIEWED BY AN EXPERT REVIEWER WHO IS A PHYSICIAN AND THE SAME MEDICAL SPECIALTY OUR PRACTICE AREA. I WAS THE SUBJECT POSITION. THE BOARD'S EXPERT REVIEWERS ARE PHYSICIANS IN GOOD STANDING WHO CONTRACT WITH THE BOARD TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL CASE REVIEW. EXPERTS REVIEW THE CASE MATERIALS AND EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE IT SURE YOU INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE OCCURRED AND TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN OPINION. REDUCING INVESTIGATION TIMELINES IT'S MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY USED EXISTING POSITIONS TO CREATE A NEW EXPERT PROCUREMENT UNIT D. P. U. THIS NEW YEAR THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND CONSISTS OF FOUR ANALYSTS AND A NON SWORN SUPERVISOR. EPA NOW HANDLES THE ENTIRE EXPERT PROCESS FOR THE MAJORITY OF CHEESE TYPES THAT NEED EXPERT REVIEW. I'M ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS DEDICATED UNIT TO THE INVESTIGATOR CASELOADS AND EXPERT OPINIONS RETURNING FASTER. I AM ALSO UTILIZING THIS NEW UNIT AS A QUALITY REVIEW POINT. I AM PERSONALLY REVIEW IN EVERY CASE THAT IS SUBMITTED FOR EXPERT REVIEW ALONG WITH THE IF YOU MANAGER TO ENSURE THAT IT SURE YOU INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE TO PROCEED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AFTER EXPERT REVIEW THE COMPLETED INVESTIGATION IS RETURNED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. IF THERE IS A VIOLATION IN THE CASE PROCEEDS TO THE PROSECUTORIAL PATHWAY. WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THIS CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF H. SURE YOU INVESTIGATION PROCESS AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MS NICHOLS- WHAT WE HEAR FROM CHRISTIANITY TO MINGUS DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WILL SHE BE SPEAKING TODAY. YES SIR CHRIS CHRISTIE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SURE ROCK CARILLO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU MY NAME IS CHRISTIANA DOMINGUEZ AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS WITH ME TODAY ON THE PHONE IS ALSO CHRIS RYAN CHIEF OF OUR DIVISION OF OPERATIONS. I'M PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE HEALTH QUALITY ENFORCEMENT SECTION FOR EACH HEARING AID. WITHIN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN PROSECUTING CASES ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT THE HEALTH WELFARE AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE QUALITY LEGAL SERVICES TO THE STATE AGENCY CLIENTS AND REGULATORY BOARDS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THE H. Q. WE HAS PROSECUTED MEDICAL MORE CASES IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL OTHER HEALTH CARE OVERSIGHT AGENCIES. ANOTHER SECTION OUR OFFICE PROSECUTES CASES FOR OTHER REGULATORY BOARDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AS YOU ARE AWARE OUR OFFICE PROSECUTION OF PHYSICIANS FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD IT RECEIVES IN REVIEWS EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY INVESTIGATORS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION NETWORK YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. IF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS FOUND IN THE CASE FILE MATTERS ASSIGNED TO DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ADAG. WHO DROPS THE ACCUSATION WHICH IS A DOCUMENT SIMILAR TO A COMPLAINTS OR INDICTMENTS. WHICH IS THEN PRESENTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SIGNATURE. I HEARING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FOR THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS IS THEN SCHEDULED. SHE SHE'S GENERALLY NEXT TAKE PLACE. H. Q. WE REPRESENTS THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT A SETTLEMENT FOSTER APPROVED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR POSITION WILL APPEAR WITH THEIR OWN REPRESENTED. THE MAJORITY OF CASES RESOLVED AT THIS STAGE THERE ARE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT IS GUIDED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. IF NO SETTLEMENT CAN BE REACHED THE CASE PROCEEDS TO HEARING WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DROPPED THE PROPOSED DECISION THAT GOES TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THE BOARD CAN ADOPTED THE PROPOSED DECISION AS WRITTEN OR INCREASE OR DECREASE THE DISCIPLINARY PENALTY. IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUSTAIN A FILING DISCIPLINE IN THE CASE OF WILL EITHER BE RETURNED FOR ADDITIONAL-INVESTIGATION AND INFORMATION OR REJECTED. THIS IS BECAUSE PURSUANT TO CASE LAW ACCUSATIONS AGAINST A CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN OR REQUIRE A CLEAR CONVINCING. EVIDENTIARY STANDARD GIVEN THAT THESE CASES SEEK TO REVOKE OR IMPACTED POSITIONS LICENSE AND WHICH THEY HAVE A PROPERTY INTEREST. THIS IS WHY WE MUST FACE ACCUSATIONS ON COMPLETELY RELIABLE AND ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE A REASONED AND FAIR DETERMINATION OF WHETHER CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED. TAGS REVIEW VOLUMES OF COMPLEX MEDICAL EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE SUFFICIENCY TO SUPPORT THE FILING OF AN ACCUSATION. RELY MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO REVIEWED CASES AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A DEVIATION FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE BY THE ACCUSED PHYSICIAN. YOU SHOULD MEDICAL MALPRACTICE COMPLAINTS FOR SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX TECHNICAL AND LUMINOUS MATTERS OF ANY OF THE CA SPORTS. EVERY REJECT THE CASE WE PROVIDE A DETAILED LEGAL MEMO TO THE CLIENT DETAILING THE LEGAL REASONS THE CASE CANNOT BE FILED THIS IS GENERALLY DUE TO A LACK STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THE TIMING FOR LEGAL REVIEW DECISIONS MADE VERY DO THE COMPLEXITY OF CASES REQUIRE EXTENSIVE OR COMPLICATED MEDICAL RECORDS EXPERT OPINIONS AND OTHER EVIDENCE. FURTHER GIVEN THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE HANDED OFF TO US BY THE HEALTH QUALITY INVESTIGATION INTO DCA SOMETIMES THESE FILES CAN TAKE LONGER TO WORK OUT IF THEY COULD COME TO US WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE UNDER THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE STANDARD OF LOS. SECONDLY MY OVERVIEW OF COURSE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MR MINGUS WE'RE- NOW I'VE BELIEVE- WE'VE CONCLUDED THE PRESENTATIONS UNDER PART A OF OUR AGENDA. I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS BEFORE I DO I'D LIKE TO ASK- A FEW OF MY OWN. BEFORE I FORGET THIS ONE- MISTER MAGOO'S IN THE CASE OF DISCIPLINE OF PRACTICING PHYSICIANS AND WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL MALPRACTICE OR OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR ALLEGED OFFENSE OR VIOLATION. WHY IS THERE A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT NECESSARILY APPLIES AS OPPOSED TO A CASE IN THE CIVIL COURT FOR MALPRACTICE FOR DAMAGES OR PERHAPS A CRIMINAL CASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- THE DOCUMENTATIONS AS PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE SO THAT'S OUR POLICY CHOICES. MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE- I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY- IN FRONT OF ME TODAY FOR THAT BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT AND PROVIDE YOUR OFFICE WITH MORE INFORMATION WHAT IS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS I ASSUME IT'S IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE IS SUPPOSED TO THE- A CIVIL CODE OR CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. YES SIR I BELIEVE IT IS- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ONE EIGHT Q. THIRTY POINT FIVE I BELIEVE IT IS THREE YEARS- I'M GONNA TRY TO. BACKTRACK NOT VERY QUICKLY AS WELL THE THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT KNOW YOUR BIBLE I JUST WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE HAVE A IDEA ABOUT HAT AND WE MAY NEED TO REVISIT THAT AT SOME POINT BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. IF OF POSITIONING- COMMIT SERIOUS MALPRACTICE AND FOR SOME REASON AND DEALING WITH MEDICALLY ON SOPHISTICATED- CONSUMERS THEM THE MATTER IS NOT BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. TO NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION- I WOULD THINK SHOULD BE TROUBLESOME TO SOME IF NOT MANY BUT YOU'VE ANSWERED IT I APPRECIATE IT LET ME HAVE SOME. SOME MORE GENERAL QUESTIONS SO OFTEN THE DATA YOU'VE PROVIDED AND CERTAINLY THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED IN OUR BACKGROUND MATERIAL INDICATES THAT YOU WILL. RECEIVE US SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF OVER TEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS HERE. WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD RECEIVES OF THESE COMPLAINTS DOES SOME AGENT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD ATTEMPT TO REACH OUT TO THE COMPLAINANTS AS PART OF A- COMPLAINT CLARIFICATION PROCESS TO. FERRET OUT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT. AS A SET OF PATIENTS OF A CONSUMER. MIGHT HAVE THAT MIGHT BEAR ON THE INITIAL DETERMINATION. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO REFER THE COMPLAINT. FROM THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT. TO THE INVESTIGATION TEAM.ANYONE US TAKE THE- EL PROCESO QUE WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION DIRECTED TO OUR HEAD OF ENFORCEMENT WHO DEALS WITH THESE THINGS ON A DAILY BASIS TRYING TO JONES. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS JENNA JONES AND WHEN A COMPLAINT IS INITIALLY RECEIVED BY THE BOARD OFFICERS. IT IS INITIALLY TRIAGE TO BUYER COMPLAINT A CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT AND- THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE COMPLAINT THAT HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE PUBLIC MEMBER- OTHER AGENCY OR MANDATORY REPORTER. AND WE REACH OUT. TO OBTAIN A RELEASE SO WE MAY OBTAIN THE MEDICAL RECORDS- AND IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED THAT IS WHEN WE ALSO REACH OUT TO THE COMPLAINANT AND ASKED FOR THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WOULD YOU SAY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED I GUESS YOU KNOW. WE HAD A SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ONCE YOU USED TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. IS A IS A IS A BODY AN AGENT OF THE BOARD. ASKING SOME PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS OF THE COMPLAINANT OR COMPLAINTS AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED OR QUICK QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANSWERED EVEN THOUGH NOT ASKED. AS PART OF THIS INITIAL PROCESS- YES AND I WILL SAY THAT A NUMBER OF OUR INITIAL COMPLAINTS COMING ANONYMOUSLY. SO THAT IS DIFFICULT AT TIMES- ALSO IF WE DON'T HAVE A PATIENT NAME THAT'S WHEN WE MAY BE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO DETERMINE WHO THE ACTUAL PATIENT WAS. SO DO I UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER TO BE% THAT IN EVERY CASE WHERE WE HAVE THE NAME OF A- COMPLAINANT TOUCH TO A COMPLAINT BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD. THAT IS RECEIVED BY THE CENTRAL COMPLAINTS UNIT THAT AN AGENT OF THE BOARD REACHES OUT PERSONALLY. HI AND SPEAKS TO THE COMPLAINANT TO FERRET OUT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE COMPLAINANT. YOU MIGHT HAVE OR MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TO BRITAIN THAT MAY BEAR ON THE DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO REFER THE COMPLAINT TO THE INVESTIGATIONS UNIT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL SPEAK VERY HONESTLY THAT IF THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION AND WE HAVE A SIGNED RELEASE WITH THE DOCUMENTATION THAT CAME IN WITH A COMPLAINT WE MAY NOT REACH OUT TO THEM. UNLESS IT WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR THERE ARE QUESTIONS RAISED BETTER IN% THE COMPLAINT. WE DO REACH OUT AND ADVISE THEM BY LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT AND THEY- SO THEY CAN REGION AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE AN INITIAL ANALYST IF THEY WISH. WITH JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE WITHOUT A COMPLAINANT INTERVIEW OR AT LEAST SOME IN PERSON CONTACT WERE SOME GIVEN TAKE. KERR'S ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT. THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT IN MAKING THE DECISION TO REFER NOT REFER. MAY NOT HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO WERE BEARING ON THE COMPLAINT FOR EXAMPLE. A PHYSICIAN'S FAILURE TO CHART A PARTICULAR PROCEDURE OR ISSUE. THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE COMPLAINT. IF THE ALLEGATION WAS THAT EIGHTY PER SIXTY JR WAS NOT CHARTED AND WE HAVE THE COMPLAINT AND WE RETAIN THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND THERE'S A DISCREPANCY THAT WOULD MOVE FORWARD TO OUR MEDICAL CONSULTANT FOR REVIEW- TO DETERMINE IF IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MOVE FORWARD FOR A FORMAL INVESTIGATION WELL I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW AS A NON HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. ALBEIT OF ONCE A LONG TIME AGO LAWYER I WOULDN'T KNOW TO ALLEGE THAT SOMETHING AS NOT CHARTED YOU ON THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD KNOW PHYSICIANS WOULD KNOW NURSES MIGHT KNOW HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MIGHT NOW I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IDEAS PERHAPS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT THE MOBILE MEDICAL BOARD CONSIDER PERHAPS TAKING A LOOK AT THIS INITIAL SCREENING PROCESS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE SCREENING BASED ON THE FACE OF THE COMPLAINT. CAN YOU SEND A LETTER TO A ROAD RELATIVELY UNSOPHISTICATED MEDICAL CONSUMER THE CONSUMER MAY NOT KNOW WHAT INFORMATION IT IS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED IN ORDER TO PROPERLY EVALUATE THE CONSUMER'S COMPLAINT AND PERHAPS A MORE DETAILED- MOST OF THE TIME IN PERSON CONTACT MIGHT BE MORE PRODUCTIVE- CHAIRMAN EUROCOIN IS WELL TAKEN AND I WILL- GO ABOUT SEEING WHAT CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE TO INCORPORATE THAT LET ME MOVE ON TO- I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON. HOW MANY CASES- ACTUALLY PROCEED. THROUGH THE FORMAL DISCIPLINE PROCESS AT WHAT STAGE OF OUR NOTES AND MY MATERIAL REFLECTED THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN CASES REFERRED TO FORMAL DISCIPLINE OUT OF THAT TEN THOUSAND PLUS. BUCKET OF COMPLAINTS. GIVE OR TAKE THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN I THINK THE NUMBER ON YOUR POWER POINT WAS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER I DON'T HAVE THE POWER POINT FRONT OF ME. BUT OF THOSE CASES REFERRED TO FORMAL DISCIPLINE HOW MANY OF THOSE CASES RESULTED. IN A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY- IF YOU CAN BEAR WITH ME I'M SORRY I'M TRYING TO GET MY. SO. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT- OF THE CASES THAT WERE AT THE STAGE READY FOR A SETTLEMENT THERE WERE 84% OF THE CASES- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AFTER AN ACCUSATION. THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE CASES THAT REACHED A SETTLEMENT- ACCORDING TO THE DIAGRAM THAT YOU SHOWED IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY- EVEN THOUGH WE STARTED WITH TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED COMPLAINTS COMING IN DURING THAT PROCESS. THE THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR AT BOTTOM NUMBER OF CASES THAT WERE. RESOLVED WENT TO FORMAL DISCIPLINE THOSE WERE AND MAY HAVE BEEN FROM WHAT THE PRIOR YEARS AND HAD JUST REACHED THE POINT OF SETTLEMENT. RIGHT BUT IF YOUR AVERAGES ABOUT TEN THOUSAND THE- IT'S ALL SORT OF RELATIVISM. YES SIR SO YOU HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WENT TO STIPULATED SETTLEMENT AND MY RECORDS% REFLECT- THAT YOU HAD ABOUT FORTY FOR OF THE TOTAL BUCKET OF COMPLAINTS FORTY FOUR CASES THAT ACTUALLY WENT TO TRIAL. YES OKAY. GO. SYSTEM THE QUESTION REGARDING THE PROCESSING PROCESSING TIME I UNDESTAND FROM THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION THAT THE TIME BETWEEN RECEIPT OF COMPLAINT AND COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION VERY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED PLUS DAYS DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO PROCESS THE CASE FROM INVESTIGATION COMPLETION ON THE AVERAGE TO- STIPULATED SETTLEMENT. I AM I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M SORRY OKAY WERE YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT TO OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE STAFFS WHEN YOU WERE ABLE TO SECURE IT THE SAME QUESTION FOR COMPLETION OF TRIAL HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY HAS IT ON THE AVERAGE DOES IT TAKE TO PROCESS THE CASE FROM COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION TO COMPLETION OF TRIAL. YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT QUESTION INTERNISTS I'VE DO YOU HAVE IT. I'M SORRY I DO NOT HAVE IT MIGHT. THAT'S FINE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT TO THE COMMITTEES STE THE STAFF OF OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE SERVICES QUESTION OF OTHER BOARDS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE TIME. STANDARDS AND TIMELINES AND I REALIZE SOME OF THESE- TIMELINES ARE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC CONTROL THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. TO TRACK HOW LONG IT TAKES. TO ACTUALLY PROCESS COMPLAINTS. THROUGH COMPLETION OF THE PROCESS WHICH EITHER INCLUDES REFERRAL TO FORMAL DISCIPLINE. AND STIPULATED SETTLEMENT OR REFERRAL TO FORMAL DISCIPLINE AND COMPLETION OF TRIAL. ON THE- STIPULATED SETTLEMENT PROCESS HOW I KNOW THAT WAS COVERED BRIEFLY DURING THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION HOW DOES THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY WORK- WHO REVIEWS. AND INITIALLY APPROVES THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN THREE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND MYSELF- MEET EACH WEEK TO DISCUSS THE VARIOUS CASES AND WE REVIEWED THE- SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL- OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AT THAT POINT WE DEVELOP WE REFER REFERENCE GUIDELINES WE REVIEW THE INFORMATION RIVER VIEW THE DETAILS OF THE- A- STRONG POINTS OF THE CASE AND THE POSSIBLE WEAK POINTS AND WE- GRANT AUTHORITY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO- FOR SETTLEMENT. AND THE TERMS OF AT THAT WE WISH TO HAVE WELL IT WAS SORT OF A SETTLEMENT ONCE THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. THAT'S PROPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN A STIPULATED. SETTLEMENT I GUESS AGREEMENT WHICH I AS A MATTER OF MY UNDERSTANDING INVOLVES AN ADMISSION BY THE PHYSICIAN AS TO THE COMMISSION OF THE ACT. AND OTHER OTHER ADMISSIONS AND STATEMENTS- REVIEWS AND APPROVES THAT OF THE DOES THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF. IN ITS ENTIRETY OR DOES THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DELEGATE THAT AUTHORITY INITIALLY TWO PANELS OR GROUPS OF BOARD MEMBERS- ONCE THE INITIAL STIPULATION IS ENTERED WITH THE SUBJECT AND THE BOARD ON BEHALF OF THE AG'S. ERNIE JOURNALS ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD THAT DOCUMENT IS FORWARDED TO A PANEL OF BOARD MEMBERS THERE ARE TWO PANELS- EACH OF THE PANELS REVIEWS. BASED ON THE ALPHABET SO ONE PANEL REVIEW THAT CASE REVIEW THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT AND- MAY APPROVE. OR REJECT IT- AND IF THEY WILL HOLD IT TO PREFERRED FOR IF MORE TWO OR MORE PEOPLE HOLD THE CASE IT WILL GO TO THE- BOARD MEETING WHERE THEY CAN HAVE MORE FORMAL DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. CANNEL AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE PANELS OF. THEMSELVES HELLO HOWEVER THOSE PANELS COMPRISED. TWO MEMBERS FIVE MEMBERS SIX MEMBERS FIVE DOCTORS TO PUBLIX- THIS WEB COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THE. THEY HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR MEMBERS PER PANEL AND HOW MANY MEMBERS DEPENDS ON HOW OF FULL THE REPORT IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE SHORT AND NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE BOARD. AND SO THE PANELS ARE NOT COMPLETE BUT THEY EACH HAVE AT LEAST FOUR MEMBERS AND THEY ARE- MORE PHYSICIAN NUMBER STAND PUBLIC MEMBERS. AND TWO WERE TWO MEMBERS OF EACH PANEL TWO MEMBERS OF A PANEL CAN HOLD THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT AND REFER IT TO. THE BOARD THE FULL BOARD FOR CONSIDERATION. NOW ADD INITIALLY. WHEN THE- CASE COMES IN FOR THE MEMBERS TO VOTE ON THEY DO THAT ELECTRONICALLY. AND TO GIVE TO MEMBERS OF THE PANEL HOLD IT THEN IT GOES TO DOT PANEL FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. IN THE CASE OF A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WORKED ON THAT CASE WILL BE INVITED TO COME IN AND SPEAK TO THE PANEL TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS. AT THAT POINT WHERE MEMBERS CAN VOTE TO ADOPT IT- ASKED CHANGE THE TERMS. FOUR TWO REJECTED AND ASKED THAT THE MATTER BE SET FOR HEARING. OKAY PERFECT LET ME GO OVER ONE FINAL MATTER AND THEN I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS ON. SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ENFORCEMENT BUT YOU KNOW REGARD RIG WITH REGARD TO THE BOARDS DESPITE PROCESS SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT SOME OF US HAVE RECEIVED STAFFERS RECEIVED THE GO TO THE CONTENTION THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN. SLOW TO ACT WHEN IT EITHER KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF CASES OF ALLEGED PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT. THERE WAS A REPORT IN A BAY AREA NEWSPAPER QUITE RECENTLY- WHERE IT WAS ALLEGED THAT THE COUNTY'S CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN. HAD SEXUALLY ABUSED YOUNG BOYS AGES SIX TO SIXTEEN IN HIS FOSTER CARE ARRANGEMENT AND AS PER AS PART OF HIS PATIENT- CADRE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY PROSECUTOR DIDN'T CHARGE HIM. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE NOTIFIED LOCAL CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AS THE DA HAS A DUTY TO DO. SINCE THIS CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN WAS A WITNESS IN CRIMINAL CASES BUT THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE PHYSICIAN COMMITTED MULTIPLE CRIMES OF MORAL TURPITUDE SPECIFICALLY SEXUAL ASSAULTS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SAME YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE COUNTY FIRED HIM FROM HIS CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN OPPOSITION AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE STATE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES BAR THE PHYSICIAN FROM WORKING WITH ANY CHILDREN OR ADULTS. IN STATE LICENSED FACILITIES. THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL FEBRUARY. NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. TEN YEARS LATER. THAT A MEDICAL BOARD ACCUSATION WAS FILED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SEEKING TO REVOKE THE PHYSICIAN'S LICENSE. OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE NEWS REPORTS OBVIOUSLY PROBABLY MANY IF NOT MOST OF OU WERE AROUND IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION INVOLVED HERE WITH THE NUMBER OF MANDATED REPORTERS OVER THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD SO MY QUESTION TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. IF YOU CAN ANSWER. IS WHY IT TOOK SO LONG. WELL SENATOR THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN ONLY REACT TO THE EVIDENCE INTO THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE MADE TO US. AND HERE ACCORDING TO WHAT THE UP FOR INFORMATION THAT I HAD IT WAS ONLY. UNTIL THE COMPLAINT WAS MADE TO US AT A MUCH SUBSEQUENT TIME THAT HE WE HAD ANY BASIS TO ACT AT ALL THAT PREVIOUS TO THAT POINT THE PRIMARY JURISDICTION WAS WITH THE- CRIPPLED THE VISION OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WHERE IT SHOULD RIGHTLY BE. AND THAT MEXICO ARE MADE TO US WE CAN INVESTIGATE I HATE TO INTERRUPT BUT THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME. THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF CAN INITIATE A COMPLAINT CAN YOU NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CONSUMER. WARRICK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO FILE A COMPLAINT. UNDER YOUR SKIN CAN THE BOARD ITSELF NOT INITIATE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A POSITION. WE CAN INITIATE A COMPLAINT WE CONDITION AGAINST TO A PHYSICIAN OR WE CAN INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION PROVIDEDWE HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO DO SO BUT WE ARE NOT A PRIMARY INVESTIGATIVE BODY. WE DON'T GO OUT SEARCHING FOR COMPLAINTS IF THINGS COME TO OUR ATTENTION THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS OF COURSE WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THEM. BUT LARGELY WE ARE FOR A COMPLAINT IT WASN'T UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE PROCESS THAT THE INFORMATION CAME TO OUR ATTENTION WHICH ALLOWED US TO ACT UPON IT. WELL I. I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE THE REACTION OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO THE STATEMENT THAT YOU ARE REACT YOU ARE A REACTIVE BODY. SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A STATE LICENSING AND REGULATING ENTITY. YOU HAVE A DUTY. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THAT CERTAINLY IN YOUR MISSION AS YOUR PRIMARY MISSION YOU HAVE THE- AUTHORITY TO INITIATE COMPLAINTS. YOU HAVE AS PER YOUR POWER POINT A- IS TO BE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS IN VARIOUS UNITS TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND- I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT AS PART OF YOUR- YOUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK. AT THIS PROCESS BECAUSE TO HAVE DID IT AND IF NOTHING ELSE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MANDATED REPORTING RULES WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL PRACTICE BECAUSE- SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS TEN YEAR PASSED. THE PROCESS BROKE DOWN WHETHER IT WAS AND I REALIZE YOU WILL PROBABLY WEREN'T THERE. BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF- THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO- RECOVER INFORMATION AND TO EVALUATE INFORMATION- AND TO PROCEED WITH THAT INFORMATION WHERE- WHERE THE FACTS. DICTATE THAT ACTION IS APPROPRIATE. I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES NOW AND- LET THEM CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AS APPROPRIATE CENTER PAM. THANK YOU I CHAIR OFTEN SHARE LOW ACTUALLY- I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE FIRST QUESTION I JUST FOLLOW UP WITH. THE. WHAT'S CENTER ROCK PASSED- SO JUST TO CLARIFY- MEDICAL WARD ICE I DO UNDERSTAND IS SOMETIMES CHALLENGED. IN TERMS OF- IDENTIFYING- THE ISSUES IT MAY BE GOING ON- YOU MENTIONED CERTAINLY- WHEN THINGS THAT FIGURES INVESTIGATION ARE OUR COMPLAINTS AND UC'S MANY IS YOU FELT DOCUMENTED HERE. BUT SHE JUST ALSO MAYBE PERHAPS DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT FOR EXAMPLE- HE WHAT OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION MEDICAL BOARD GETS THAT MIGHT TRIGGER COMPLAINTS SO- I THINK- LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST PHYSICIANS- WHETHER CIVIL OR CRIMINAL TO THOSE- COME IF IT INVOLVES A- PERSON LICENSED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA DOES. COME TO THE BOARD- OR ARE SOMEONE SCANNING FOR THAT OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT SHOW UP IN OTHER TYPES OF DATABASES I THINK- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAINTAIN CERTAIN DATABASES. AS WELL- IT. A RELATION TO CERTAIN TYPES OF- BEHAVIOR BY PHYSICIANS OR OTHER PROVIDERS. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE ROLE OF THOSE TYPES OF SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING INVESTIGATIONS OR COMPLAINTS- SEPARATE FROM SO YOU'LL OF ARTICLES EIGHTY CURES DATABASE RIGHT YOU SEE SOMEONE'S PRESCRIBING A LARGE AMOUNT NOW THAT'S NOT A COMPLAINT. OF IT SOMEONE'S OUTSIDE OF THE RANGE OF THAN YOU KNOW- IT IS IT- SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO YOUR PROCESSES AND IN LOOKING AT THOSE SORT DATASETS- AND I GUESS AND- ROTS CASE WOULD BE- POTENTIALLY. I ASSUME THERE WERE SOME CRIMINAL OR CIVIL ACTION THAT TOOK BY TAKING PLACE BY PROSECUTOR MAYBE IT DIDN'T. NEED TO SPEAK TO HOW THAT MIGHT TRIGGER INVESTIGATIONS. YES WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION LOOK THERE ARE A WHOLE SERIES OF DATABASES AND REPORTING MANDATES THAT WE CAN USE TO TRGGER- COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS. THERE'S A DATABASE FOR EXAMPLE OF ALL THIS WITH ACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE ACROSS THE STATE. MEDICAL BOARDS IN ALL FIFTY STATES THOSE COME TO US AND THEY GIVE US NOTICE ABOUT A LICENSEE WHO HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO AN ACTION IN ANOTHER STATE. THERE A WHOLE SERIES OF REPORTING MANDATES DEALING WITH CIVIL ACTIONS IN TERMS OF MLPRACTICE SUITS DALY WITH THE RESTRICTION OF PRIVILEGESTO PRACTICE AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS. THEY ALL COME TO US THEY ARE ALL VERY USEFUL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IN ALL OF THOSE WERE DEPENDED UPON THE REPORTS. THAT COME IN TO US AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR DIRECTOR ENFORCEMENT MS JONES. IF YOU CAN OF SUPPLEMENT THAT ANSWER AND ACTUALLY- BEFORE SHE BEGINS- IN IN HER ANSWER COULD SHE ALSO PERHAPS ADDRESS- BY THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN FIGURED BY THOSE DATABASES ARE. NOW THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION- SEPARATE FROM AN ACTUAL SOMEONE FILING A COMPLAINT YOU KNOW DIRECTLY WITH THE BOARD SIZE EVER TRIGGERED AN INVESTIGATION ON ITS OWN AND IF YES HOW MANY HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN. YEAH. I THINK WE HAVE THAT RECORDED. IT IS FIND THAT. CHART WE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FROM A NON OF DIFFERENT SOURCES- MALPRACTICE SETTLEMENTS. THAT ARE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WE WERE REPORTS OF THOSE- WE ENDED A BEST BUT ON THE AND IT IS A CLEAR IT DIDN'T SO USE A CIVIL OF SIZE DO YOU WAY FOR SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY YOU OR YOU USE IT YOU GO OVER START AND- R. OR NOT ARE YOU. LOOK AT IT MORE DETAIL SO AT THAT ELECTION I WANT TO TRY TO. DISCERN BETWEEN SOMEONE ACTIVELY HAVING TO SUBMIT SOMETHING TO SAY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS VERSES YOU'RE SCANNING THESE DATASETS STUDIES SAID THE STEEL- HOSPITAL STAFF YOU KNOW CIVIL CASES IT CENTER AND SAYING- WE SEE A PATH TO SOMETHING HERE THAT WE THINK. WE NEED TO START. BECAUSE A JUDGE MADE A CERTAIN RULING ARE- MEDICAL STAFF MADE A CERTAIN RULING ABOUT. BEHAVIOR OF A OF A LICENSEE- WELL IN THE CASE OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES- WE ARE NOT. SCANNING THE COURT RECORDS IF SOMEONE IN- IDENTIFY SOMETHING. FIRE TO THE SETTLEMENT IS BEING REACHED WE WILL LOOK INTO IT BUT- THERE IS A MANDATORY REPORTING UNDER THE EIGHT OH ONE POINT OH ONE SECTION WHERE THEY HAVE TO REPORT THE MALPRACTICE SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS TO US- WE ALSO HAVE- THE CORNERS REPORTING CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED- THE NUMBERS OF MALPRACTICE REPORTS IN NIGHT IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY OR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO. BUT I WILL BE HONEST WE DO NOT- REGULARLY RUN CHECKS ON THE CIVIL COURT SYSTEM OF FORT CHECK FOR MALPRACTICE CASES THAT MAY BE PENDINGOKAY WELL ANY CITY BUT YOU BUT YOU SAID YOU DO RECEIVE REPORTS OF ANY ONE AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD POINT OUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS IT'S VERY LOW CORRELATION BETWEEN MALPRACTICE SUITS AND ACTUAL QUALITY BUT I WANTED TO ACTED ON SITE. BUT YOU ARE RECEIVING HE TOLD YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE% RECEIVING THESE REPORTS RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE A CIVIL CASE THAT RESULTS IN A- I GUESS A- ANALYTICS. AWARD OR FINDING OF OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU'LL RECEIVE A REPORT THAT HAPPENED. THAT THAT EVER IN ITSELF- BECAUSE SOME FURTHER INVEST A EXAMINATION OF WHETHER THAT'S A CIRCUMSTANCE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO SAY. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET INFORMATION FROM HOSPITAL STAFF HAVE TAKEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST PHYSICIANS. WE HAVE YEAH POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL CASES HAVE HAPPENED INVOLVED LICENSEES. SO I'M TRYING TO DISCERN BETWEEN DO AND YOU DO SEE IT HE SAID MY TAKES YOU DO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU JUST TOLD ME. THE NEW THOSE IN ITSELF AND LEAD TO FURTHER EXAMINATION BY THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT MAY THEN TRIGGER A FULLER INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIALLY ACTION BUT MEDICAL BOARD. YES SIR. OKAY AND HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN PURSES AND SOMEONE ACTUALLY FILING AN ACTIVE COMPLAINT. EVERY CASE THAT WE RECEIVE A NOTICE ON. FORT WEATHERBY MALPRACTICE- A CRIMINAL CHARGER RASPY. WERE OPENING ALL OF THOSE COMPLAINTS. AND REVIEWING THEM. OKAY SO WHEN I THINK THAT MIGHT BE IN THE AND- BABY YOU MAY HAVE THE DETAILS HERE SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP THERE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE EXAMPLE SERA JUST GAVE- YOU SAID ELLIS TESTIFIED THAT DECISION RECEIVED INFORMATION TOLD VERY LATE INTO THE PROCESS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAUSED THAT DELAY WAS IT BECAUSE- AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE WASN'T A YELLOW LEGAL ACTION THAT AND- SEND A REPORT OR SOMETHING BUT- I THINK THAT'S- CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S THAT HIGH PROFILE MURDER IT WAS A LOT OF. IS IT'S INTERRUPTED LIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY. SOMEWHERE SOMETHING YOU'D THINK WOULD HAVE MADE ITS WAY TO THE MEDICAL BOARD EARLIER- NOW THAT IS SELL MIGHT BE. USEFUL TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE TYPES OF CASES AND GO WELL WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WERE AND WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO SAY THAT- THAT MAY BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK INTO AS WELL ESPECIALLY SINCE IT INVOLVES A LICENSEE AND ITS INVOLVES SOMETHING THAT'S- FAIRLY. SERIOUS IN RELATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OUR BEHAVIOR IN PRACTICE- WE WILL BE HAPPY TO RESEARCH THAT. AND I WILL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OKAY SO THAT ALL RIGHT SO I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND ALSO CLARIFIED TERMS OF FOUR. DIFFERENT WHAT. WHAT SORT OF ISSUES I KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES LOOK A LOT. AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS- LET'S SEE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION. THE OTHER CELEBS LET'S MOVE ON- MAY I SPEAK TO THE- SEARCH AREA OKAY BEFORE I MOVE ON YES. THIS IS OUR KRAUSER. UP ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS AND SERVICE ON THE BOARD. IS THAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT BOARDS- WITHIN THE DCA AND DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COLLABORATION- SO THERE'S ALSO A SEMANTIC ISSUE HERE- WHEN WE SPEAK OF COMPLAINT. WE'RE NOT MEANING TO SAY THAT MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO FILL OUT A REPORT AND MAKE A COMPLAINT. A COMPLAINT IS SOMETHING THAT WE BECOME AWARE OF WHAT WE ALSO READ THE NEWSPAPER AND BECOME AWARE OF THINGS THAT THE NEWSPAPER. OVER THE YEARS- APART READING AN ARTICLE IN THE NEWSPAPER I SOMETIMES WILL CALL CALL THE- THE BOARD DIRECTOR AND SAY WHAT ABOUT THIS AND GENERALLY BY THE TIME I BECOME AWARE OF SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER THE BOARDS ALREADY INVESTIGATING IT. HI SIMILARLY- THERE WAS A RECENT CASE WHERE. THE MEDICAL BOARD WAS INVESTIGATING A COMPLAINT- AND THE L. A. TIMES WROTE AN ARTICLE THAT THEY CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BECAUSE THERE SEEM THAT THEIR CALLS ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE TO REPORT- ON THE PART OF THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAID WELL WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS. JONES SO SINCE THAT TIME I KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS REACHED OUT TO ALL ASSOCIATED ORGANIZATIONS. I AND THIS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS SUCH THAT WE CAN. LET ONE ANOTHER KNOW WHEN WE BECOME AWARE OF AN ISSUE. THAT MAY REACH ACROSS MULTIPLE BOARDS OR MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. REGARDING THIS SPECIFIC CASE- A PEDOPHILE YEAH IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE BOARD BEGAN INVESTIGATING AND WHEN THE BOARD BECAME AWARE OF IT. SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO VIEW THIS AS A SENTINEL CASE. AND TO LOOK OVER ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT INVESTIGATED THAT CASE AND VIEWED THE CASE AND FIND OUT. WHY THAT HAD NOT BEEN REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD SOONER. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD COME OUT OF ISSUES SUCH AS THIS. WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP US IN ASSURING THAT WE HAVE A GREATER COLLABORATION- BETWEEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND GREATER SHARING OF INFORMATION. SO THAT THINGS DON'T FALL BY THE BY THE WAYSIDE. BUT AGAIN SEMANTICALLY. A COMPLAINT BY DEFINITION IS ANY. CHARGE OR CONCERN IT COMES TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION WHETHER IT BE BY REPORTING FROM- CRIMINAL SYSTEMS OR SETTLE SYSTEMS. OR HOSPITAL REPORTING OF- DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CALL A COMPLAINT. I WOULDN'T WANT- THE COMMITTEE TO THINK THAT. BY COMPLAIN FOR MEANING THAT SOME MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO. MAKE AN ADDITIONAL COMPLAINT N ADDITIONAL TWO ARE BECOMING AWARE OF IT OKAY BUT ONCE WE ARE AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. BENNETT IS INVESTIGATING OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT EXPLANATION PRECIADO CLARIFICATION WHAT THE TERM COMPLAINT MEANS AND- I DO THINK THAT. WE SHOULD LOOK A SOME OF THESE CASES WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE MEDICAL BOARD- WAS DELAYED IN TAKING SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW- ACTION IN TERMS OF AT LEAST AND THESE INVESTIGATING. AND WHETHER- DOOR OTHER STEPS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN DOWN BUT MADE A MAJOR MEDICAL BOARD AWARE EARLIER- AND- CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE THE MEDICAL BOARD'S HELP AS WELL SO YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO DO THINGS THAT AREN'T AFFECTED. OKAY IN THE MOVE ON TO- NEXT QUESTION I HAVE ACTUALLY- SO I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES OF COURSE IS THAT- YOU KNOW WITH YOUR YOUR REVENUES ARE. USED EXPENDITURES ARE LIKING YOUR REVENUES AND THEN- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THINGS MORE EFFICIENT. BUT I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT IN YOUR REPORT- THE MEDICAL WORK CALIFORNIA NOTES AND- THE 88% OF APPLICATIONS IT RECEIVES IN REVIEWS DEFICIENT AT THE TIME TO REVIEW. NOW WHY I BRING. THIS UP. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO THE MEDIC BOARD TELLS FOR LES OR THESE ARE. WHO APPARENTLY SUCCESS BY FOR CAR. AND GOT THROUGH THE COLLEGE PROCESS AND TRAIN YOU HOW TO FILL AN APPLICATION TO THEN APPLY TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE AND HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOL APPLICATION FULLY- WITHOUT- TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND THEN APPLIED FOR RESIDENCY SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AREN'T USED TO APPLYING FOR THINGS. AND YET DEFICIENT THE TIME REVIEW. SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A SYSTEMS PROBLEM THERE- WHAT. IF YOU TAKE A GROUP OF VERY SMART TALENT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO APPLY TO THINGS EVEN COMPLEX APPLICATIONS IT YOU KNOW I'VE THAT. RESIDENCY DIRECTORS I KNOW WHAT MEDICAL SCHOOL APPLICATION LOOKS LIKE AND YET SEEM LIKE WE CANNOT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS OR SOMETHING. GOING ON WITH THESE APPLICATIONS. AND I WILL POINT OUT THOUGH IN MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE- YOU KNOW FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE LICENSEE OF THIS FOR NOW THIS IS A WHILE AGO. FOR EXAMPLE ONE TO HANG UP TO HAPPEN IN MY LICENSE APPLICATION WAS IS THAT THEY WANTED A LETTER OR PROOF OF RESIDENCY FROM MY RESIDENCY DIRECTOR. I PROVIDED FROM THE EXISTING RESIDENCY DIRECTOR BECAUSE THE PERSON'S RESIDENCY DIRECTOR. TIME I DID MY RESIDENCY HAD PASSED AWAY. AND YET THE MEDICAL SAID. WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE I NEED TO GET A FROM MY ACTUAL RESIDENCY DIRECTOR WHO INFLICTED WAS IN THE GRAVE AND WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A LETTER ALTHOUGH I'M SURE WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO DO SO IF HE WAS ABLE TO. AND SO THAT WENT ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND PROBABLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH STAFF TIME THAT TOOK FOR THEM FOR ME IS. QUITE EXPLAINED THAT. PROJECT WHO DO YOU WANT A LETTER FROM BECAUSE I AM FORTY CAN GET IT FROM ITS CENTER SO- FROM UP FOR. AND THEN THE OTHER ACTUALLY INTERESTING PROBLEM THAT HUNG UP AND AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT MY APPLICATION BUT IT. I'M JUST SAYING LIKE HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO DO THIS- THAT- YEAH RIGHT NOW I SEE THE BOARD'S MOVING TOWARD INSTITUTIONALIZING CURE FOR RESIDENCY APPARENTLY. MASSACHUSETTS DID HAVE THAT AT THE TIME THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA TIME SO WE WENT ROUND AND ROUND OR- ABOUT. MY LICENSURE AS WELL AND FINALLY GOT THAT STRAIGHTENED OUT. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION REALLY THE BOILS DOWN TO. WHAT HOW MUCH TIME AND MONEY WE SPENDING ON REVIEWING THESE APPLICATIONS. IF 88% THE APPLICATIONS ARE DEFICIENT THE TIME REVIEW ARE WE BEING TO. NOT BEING TRANSPARENT ENOUGH WITH PEOPLE APPLYING WHERE WE MAKING IT SO HARD. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY EXPERIENCED IN FOLLOWING VERY COMPLEX INSTRUCTIONS AND PROVIDING VERY COMPLEX DOCUMENTATION AND IF. APPROVED IT THROUGH AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT. CYCLES OF APPS. IN ORDER EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD APPLY FOR A MEDICAL BOARDOF CALIFORNIA LICENSE. IS THERE ANY CAN CAN WE TALK ABOUT EFFICIENCY. HERE- IT'S ONE THING IT'S LIKE 10% I CAN IMAGINE THISGROUP OF PEOPLE HOW TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION THERE IS INSUFFICIENT AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY POOR. DO YES OKAY I WILL ASK OUR GENERAL COUNSEL- MISS WEB TO DEAL WITH THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN FOR THAT QUESTION AND I THINK. YOU HIT IT- IN PART THAT. PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE'S DEFICIENCIES UPON FIRST REVIEW IS THAT THE BOARD DOES REQUIRE PRIMARY SOURCE DOCUMENTATION FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND PASSED SEEN AS SAID THE REQUIRED EXAMS. THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARD- OKAY ARE SAID THE TICKET AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. I HAD TO PROVIDEPRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION FOR APPLYING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL FROM COLLEGE AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE FIGHT TO RESIDENTS AND BY LAW AS A RESIDENCY DIRECTOR WE NEEDED CERTAIN PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION AND YET I DIDN'T HAVE THIS RATED EFFICIENCY AND APPLICATIONS FROM PEOPLE OF FLIGHT FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL TO MY RESIDENCY PROGRAM. SO I THINK IT WAS CLEARER AND LESS THE REQUIREMENTS AS A AND I GUESS I POINT OUT MY OWN EXAMPLE BUT THAT'S NO IT'S ONLY SAMPLES NOT PAID- IT'S- DATA. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND THAT YOU CAN'T MEET ALL RIGHT BY ASKING FOR A LETTER FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAPPENED TO PASS AWAY BUT- YEAH ARE WE ARE WE MAKING IT TO ADDRESS I MEAN WE I COULD I COULD PROVIDE AND LETTER FROM THE EXIT PROGRAM DIRECTOR WHO ACTUALLY WAS PRACTICING WHO HAD ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS I COULD HAVE. LETTERS FROM THE INSTITUTION BUT IT WAS NOT MADE CLEAR IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE PROGRAM AFTER ACTUALLY ISN'T THERE PASSED AWAY OR SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED- THAT THESE WERE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE BOARD WHICH REALLY ARE STILL PRIMARY SOURCE I MEAN IT'S THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR WOULD STILL BE POINT THE SAME. RECORDS AND GOING OH YEAH I KNOW HE COMPLETED AS IT SEE ALL THE HIS FACULTY SAID HE WAS FINE AT CETERA AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A LETTER IN THE FILES RESIDENTS HERE ACTOR THAT I WRITE THE END OF EVERY YEAR WHEN WE HAVE GRADUATING RESIDENTS THAT WE FIND THE FILE SAYING YES THEY HAVE COMPLETED- AFFECT AT THE CERTIFY IT TO THE ACT OF TWO OTHER. OTHER PEOPLE'S. WELL BUT YET. SO AGAIN. PRIMARY SOURCE AND DC KNOW HOW TO AS YOU I NEEDED YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS FOR THIS FROM THIS THIS FROM THIS THEY CAN DO IT SO WHY IS IT STILL 88% OF PEOPLE STILL CANNOT CANNOT GET CANNOT FOLLOW THOSE INSTRUCTIONS EITHER SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS. BORROWED BEING UNREASONABLE AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S ALSO INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE APPLICANT SENT TO STAFF TIME TO GO AND SEND THE LETTER REJECTIONS SAYING YOU NEEDED THAT AT CETERA BUT- YET THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CLARITY. THAT PEOPLE CAN'T DO IT THAT 80% OF THE PEOPLE STILL HAVE A DEFICIENT APPLICATION THE TIME TO REVIEW. AT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THAT QUESTION- SHE POINTS TO MAKE FIRST.

ONCE WHICH YEAH WHICH THE LATE OF COURSE MY- YEAH SO ANYWAY FORTUNATE SLIDE EARLY SO DIDN'T- BUT ANYWAY DEBATE LATE APPLICATION BY MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS BECAUSE WE WENT IN CIRCLES AND CIRCLES AND CIRCLES I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE STAFF TO THE GO AND TELL ME THEY WERE EVERY ALTERNATIVE AT CENTRE AND DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO SO I HAVE TO KEEP TRYING DIFFERENT ANGLES AND SO FORTH MAKE UP INSISTING ON I KEPT SAYING YOU WANT THE DEATH CERTIFICATE FROM THE PERSON WHO PASSED AWAY IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED. TO GO TALK TO HIS FAMILY AND SEE WHAT IF YOU GIVE ME A COPY. I THE SECOND. POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. THAT IT'S NOT. A LACK OF FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS IN. MOST CASES IT'S THAT. THE APPLICANT HAS APPLIED. THEY'VE ALREADY SENT THE REQUEST OUT TO. THE VARIOUS ENTITIES FOR THE BOARD NEEDS PRIMARY SOURCE AND THE BOARD IS WAITING. FOR THAT INFORMATION TO COME IN. SO THAT IT'S SUFFICIENT BECAUSE THE BOARD IS WAITING FOR THAT INFORMATION COMMAND NOT BECAUSE- THE APPLICANTS- DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS. OKAY THE- WHEN I WANT TO MAKE IT THAT THE- IS MAY ME FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND US WITH IT'S- NEW DOCKS PORTAL AND SO. IT BISS HAS CREATED HUGE EFFICIENCIES AND HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR PROGRAMS AND SCHOOLS TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS. THAT HAS STREAMLINED THIS PROCESS AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE. LEVINE IN THE STORE. THANKS THAT THE BOARD HAS LEARNED FROM KOBE HAS- EXPERT THIS CHANGE AND THE BOARD WILL BE ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY EVEN MARK OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST THINK THIS IS VERY SYMBOLIC POTENTIALLY AND I APPRECIATE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN YOU CAN CONTINUE TO INFORM US AS TO THE IMPROVEMENTS. THAT YOU ARE MAKING BUT I JUST THAT YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE WHO OF COURSE DEAL FORTUNATELY YOU MAY ONLY APPLY ONCE AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU GET LICENSE AND IT REELS ALAS CENTER SIMPLER BUT- IT REALLY ANY I'VE HEARD SO MANY HORROR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE RYING TO FLY FOR A LICENSE HERE WHO IT'S NOT ISSUES THEY'RE BEING GOOD STANDING IT'S AN ISSUE OF REALLY THIS ROUTE- NEED A LOT OF. WELL ANYWAY I DO THE SAME AND I ALSO WANTED TO GET WHAT THE COST OF THAT IS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S. STAFF TRYING TO KEEP. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT. LEVEL OF ERRORS. OKAY WELL MOVE ON HERE I WANT TO THE LABOR THAT'S WHY- AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW YOU KNOW GOING TO HAVE A SECOND SESSION. RECOVERY FEE STRUCTURE FINANCIAL. SOLVENCY STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND ALL THE REST OF. HIS JUST IN CASE THAT. BEARS ON YOUR QUESTION OKAY YES SORRY NO THANK YOU AND- I WILL THERE ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS I WILL TRY TO LEAD TO THE- THE SUBSEQUENT HEARING RELATED TO THOSE ISSUES- IN TERMS OF- THE ISSUE NUMBER ONE- IN TERMS OF BOARD COMPOSITION. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF THE BOARD DOES AND- WE HAVE YEAH- MANY EXCELLENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD- BUT AFTER MIDDAY- IN THIS. PERHAPS THOSE BACKGROUND EVENTUALLY- IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT- WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE DOES THE STAFF PROVIDE TO MEMBERS OF MORE PARTICULARLY THE PUBLIC MEMBERS ABOUT STANDARD OF CARE- EVAN FORTY HEARD SOME DISCUSSIONS AT THE BOARD THAT- MAYBE A LITTLE DISTURBED THAT THERE WAS NOT A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF STANDARD OF CARE AND EVIDENCE. AND AND WE'RE- SOME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS MADE STATEMENTS THAT WERE SOMEWHAT CONCERNING IN REGARDS TO- WE CERTAINLY AN ISSUE I HAD GREAT INTEREST AND- CAN YOU CAN WE CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL HAVE SOME BEARING IF THEY'RE PLAYING ROLES AND INVESTIGATIONS. YES I WOULD BE VERY PLEASED TO. ADDRESS THAT SUBJECT. I CAN ASSURE OF THE SENATOR THAT STANDARD OF CARE IS AT THE VERY HEART OF WHAT WE DO. INSEAD THE VERY HEART OF THE ROLE OF THE BOARD MEMBER. DURING THE SHORT TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN THERE WE'VE HAD. WE'VE HAD PRESENTATIONS AT BOARD LEVEL IN TRAINING. ON THE ISSUE OF STANDARD OF CARE IT IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS REGULARLY- WHICH IS REGULARLY- REVIEWED AND CONSULTED ON. OBVIOUSLY ANYTIME THAT THERE IS DISCUSSION OF IN THE INDIVIDUAL CASE IN THE PARTICULAR. SANCTIONS ARE THE STANDARD OF CARE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THAT POINT SO THE REVIEW OF EVERY CASE WE WOULD HOPE REINFORCES. THE CENTRALITY OF STANDARD OF CARE. OKAY WELL I AM VERY APPRECIATE THAT I SAID IF I HAVE A AS ABSORBED SOME BOARD- HEARINGS- WHICH- THAT THAT. HAS LED TO SOME CONCERN ON MY PART- THAT- THAT SOMETIMES SOME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS MAY NOT BE AS AWARE OF- PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE AND STANDARD OF CARE- BUT- APPRECIATE- THAT EXPLANATION- JUST GO FLIP THROUGH HERE ALL RIGHT WELL I WILL- I THINK MOST OF MY OTHER QUESTIONS INVOLVED LICENSURE WHICH I UNDERSTAND BE TAKEN UP AT A SUBSEQUENT HEARING SO I'LL LEAVE IT FOR VAN- THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CHAIR OFF THANK YOU CENTER PAN I HAVE- LOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG CENTER HER TADO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON IN THE Q. AND AS I'M STIRRING THIS BACK TOWARD ENFORCEMENT I JUST WANT TO PUT A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE RECORD THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING RESPONSES DELIVERED TO THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES- ONE HAS TO DO WITH BOARD SELF INITIATION OF INCREASE AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY. BOARD DIRECTED INCREASE ON DOCTOR MISCONDUCT WITHOUT PRIOR. COMPLAINTS WERE INITIATED IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR AND CERTAINLY THE FISCAL YEAR BEFORE THAT AND I'M NOT TALKING MEDICAL MALPRACTICE NECESSARILY DR PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT. THAT'S ONE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A STATE AGENCY IN THIS STATE WHO TOOK ACTION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ON THAT. ATTRITION THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD BEGAN TO TAKE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE DOCTOR'S BEHAVIOR AND BASICALLY BUT SINCE IT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPER I'D LIKE TO SEE A TIME LINE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE- THAT I CITED. THERE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INFORMATION REQUESTED- YOU CAN. LET ME KNOW NOW OR BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THE HEARING OR ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY TO- THE CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR BOTH COMMITTEES. HELLO SAYS JUST BY POINT OF CLARIFICATION THERE BY TERMS OF THE FIRST QUESTION YOU SAID- COMPLAINT SORRY WHICH AWARE WE'VE INITIATED A- AN INVESTIGATION WITHOUT A PRIOR COMPLAINT ARE YOU INCLUDING THEIR THE MANDATORY REPORTS THAT WE RECEIVE YES. OKAY SO HE'S WITH BECAUSE FRANKLY SIR I'M BOTHERED BY THE- AND YOUR INITIAL COMMENTS INDICATING THAT. YOU'RE SORT OF A REACTIVE REGULATORY AGENCY AS OPPOSED TO A PROACTIVE REGULATORY AGENCY AND I WANT TO GET A FEEL FOR AND A HANDLE ON. WHAT EXACTLY YOU DO IN THE ABSENCE OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND I'M PARTICULARLY BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA FOR HIS STATE DEPARTMENT. OF SOCIAL SERVICES I BELIEVE IT TOOK TOOK ACTION TO BAR THIS POSITION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE BUT AN ACCUSATION WAS FILED SO I THINK THE TIMELINE ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE WOULD BE INSTRUCTED. AND YOU KNOW I WASN'T ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT THE TIME LINE IN TERMS OF THE PARTICULAR PHYSICIAN. BUT YOU THAT THE FIRST THING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS. WHERE WE HAD INITIATED. INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT A PRIOR COMPLAINT RIGHT AND NOW FIGHT WITHOUT A PRIOR COMPLAINT ARE YOU INCLUDING THEIR THE MANDATORY REPORTS WE GET IN TERMS OF MALPRACTICE RESTRICTION A PRACTICE. DO YOU INCLUDE THAT AS A COMPLAINT OR NOT. NO I DON'T INCLUDE THAT AS A COMPLAIN I CONCLUDE THAT IS RECEIVING INFORMATION THAT COULD CAUSE YOU TO AND BY THE WAY YOU'RE YOU FOCUSED ON MALPRACTICE I'M TALKING. PRIMARILY ABOUT PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ACTIVITY SUCH AS THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A HANDLE ON. HOW REACTIVE THE BOARD IS OR IS OT. WHEN THE BOARD KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BASED ON THE INFORMATION- EXISTING OUT THERE OF PHYSICIANS CONDUCT THAT WHETHER. IT OCCURRED OR NOT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. OKAY THAT'S UNDERSTOOD PERFECT. CARILLO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM ROTH I WANNA AT. JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION BACK TO BACK TO TCHERASSI COMMENTARY DIRECTED TO- MR PACIFICA OF REGARDING THE- ARTICLE SPECIFICALLY THAT HAPPENED FROM THE COUNTY THAT I REPRESENT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY- IS PROFESSOR ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE ARTICLE AT HAND FROM THE BAY AREA NEWS GROUP. THAT WHAT YOU HAD WAS FOUND TO HAVE TWENTY THIRD. YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOME MORE MEANS TO IDENTIFY. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE ARTICLE PUBLISHED ON FEB TWENTY THIRD TWO A TITLE AFTER DECADES OF SEX ABUSE CLAIMS. STATE MOVES TO STOP FORMER SANTA CLARA CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN FROM PRACTICING MEDICINE I'VE- ARE YOU ABLE TO SELL I'M FAMILIAR CERTAINLY ABOUT THE CASE YES YES OKAY. YOU STATED EARLIER- IT WAS BROUGHT ALSO TO BUY A TO YOUR ATTENTION JUST JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO BY SENATOR ROTH. ABOUT THE CASE AT HAND AND I WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK AND DISTURBED BY YOUR RESPONSE. STATING THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A COMPLAINT TO BE MADE FIRST. IT CAN YOU HELP ME SUMMARIZE IT HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT AS TO WHY YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU STATE OR MAYBE CAN CLARIFY YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU STATED THAT YOU HAVE TO. BELIEVE THAT YOU MUST WAIT FOR A KEY A COMPLAINT FIRST. YEAH WELL I THOUGHT DOCTOR EXPLAINED IT QUITE CLEARLY WE HAVE TO. HAVE INFORMATION. THAT GIVES US A BASIS FOR GOING FORWARD. THE INFORMATION COMES FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. THE OBVIOUS ONE IS THROUGH THE COMPLAINTS PROCESS BUT THERE IS PUBLIC INFORMATION. THERE ARE MANDATORY REPORTS THAT COME THROUGH US. WE GET ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS WHICH AGAIN ARE CERTAIN CREATE CERTAIN PROBLEMS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE TO FOLLOW UP. SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF BASIS UPON WHICH WE- CAN ARE. TAKE ACTION THE DIFFICULTY THAT I HAVE IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW. ON THE BASIS OF NO INFORMATION. WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO SEE IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS PROBLEMATIC IN SOME PLACE WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF OUR DON'T KNOW EXIST WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING. TO GO NO WE CAN BE A VARIETY OF THINGS WE FOLLOW UP ON NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS OR OTHER MEDIA REPORTS BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A NAME AND WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME BASIS. UPON WHICH WE CAN COLLECT INFORMATION. SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE OF THE ROLE OF THE BOARD IS TO BE PROACTIVE. WELL YOU KNOW IT IS IN THE SENSE THAT I'VE JUST SET. BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME INFORMATION. THAT GIVES US THE BASIS. TO GO FORWARD. SEEKING FURTHER INFORMATION. MAY I SPEAK TO THE QUESTION. SURE HI THIS IS SAID DR CROSS AGAIN- IF I MADE- HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF INTERPRETING AGAIN SEMANTICALLY WHAT WE MEAN BY REACTOR VERSUS A PROACTIVE- WE HAVE TO HAVE INFORMATION TO REACT TO. BUT AGAIN WE DON'T REQUIRE SOMEONE TO SEND IN A REPORT SPECIFICALLY TO THE MEDICAL BOARD SAYING- SO AND SO WHAT I DID THIS AND- YOU KNOW DID YOU READ THE NEWSPAPER- SO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE DOES COME TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION. BUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE STAFF THAT THE RESET EVERY NEWSPAPER SO THERE COULD BE SOME ARTICLES- THAT THEY DON'T COME TO OUR ATTENTION. I AS I SAID EARLIER GENERALLY BY THE TIME I READ SOMETHING IN THE PAPER THE BOARDS ALREADY. WORKING ON IT- WHAT IS MEANT WHEN WE SAY WE'RE NOT PROACTIVE. IF WE DON'T HAVE A STAFF OF A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO WERE HANGING OUT HOSPITAL LOW LOUNGES AND STREET CORNERS OVERHEARING CONVERSATIONS TO PICK UP ON CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IN SOMEBODY MAY BE MISBEHAVING. WHAT WE NEVER DID MORE INFORMATION- WE NEVER IGNORE CONCERNS VIDAK READ OF SOMEONE WHO MAY BE MISBEHAVING IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. LET'S NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT UNTIL SOMEONE SENDS IN A COMPLAINT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD WE'RE PROACTIVE. ONCE WE HAVE INFORMATION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CADRE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT IN THE WOODS- AND IN THE STREETS SO TO SPEAK- OVERHEARING CONVERSATIONS TO COLLECT INFORMATION. SO I FEAR THAT WE'RE GETTING HUNG UP ON SEMANTICS. AND THE SUGGESTION THAT WAS MADE EARLIER BY SENATOR ROTH. YOU LOOK AT THIS BAY AREA CASES A SENTINEL CASE. AND TO SEE WHERE IN THE- CHAIN OF EVENTS. THERE WAS A FAILURE TO NOTIFY THE MEDICAL BOARD BY ONE AGENCY OR ANOTHER AGENCY. WILL BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE THERE IS MANDATORY REPORTING- AND IF INDEED THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP US TO INCREASE MANDATORY REPORTING. SEVEN MORE THINGS BECOME EVIDENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THAT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN PROTECTING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO HELP US OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION. AND WE WILL BE VERY PROACTIVE AS WELL AS REACTIVE I IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING AND ARE DOING OUR JOB TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC OKAY. THANK YOU MR KRAUSS YOU KEEP BRINGING UP THE WPA THE WORD SEMANTICS THIS IS NOT SO BASIS THE SEMANTICS OF INTERPRET. YOUR COMMENTS TO BE SOMEWHAT CONDESCENDING THIS ABOUT VERY BIG BABY BEING VERY DIRECT ISN'T ABOUT GOING INTO THE WOODS IT'S A SIMPLISTIC AS HAVING A GOOGLE ALERT FOR CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD WHAT THE FAILURES TO ACT. SPECIFICALLY NOT HAD A PASSING THE BUCK I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BEING PROACTIVE WE EXPECT MORE THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARING FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD I THINK IT'S A FAILURE FOR THE BOARD SPECIFICALLY ON THE OWNERSHIP OF THE- HEADLINE OF THAT REPORT SO. BACK TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THE PUBLICATION ITSELF. DO YOU INTERPRET THAT AS A FAILURE OF THE BOARD. WHAT. WHAT IS THE DATE OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE DAY THE DATE OF THE PUBLICATION IS FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE YES BUT A MONTH AGO NOT TOO LONG AGO AND THIS TITLE RETREATS AFTER DECADES OF SEX ABUSE CLAIMS STATE MOVES TO STOP FORMER SENATE CLEAR CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN FROM PRACTICING MEDICINE. YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE NOTE PRIOR TO THAT WAS WHEN WE HAD FILED THE ACCUSATION WHICH IS A PUBLIC RECORD THE ACCUSATION WAS PUBLISHED AS A RESULT OF AN INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS INITIATED PREVIOUSLY AT THE SOONEST POSSIBLE DATE THAT IT COULD BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IT THEN WENT THROUGH A PROCESS IT WENT THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION IT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO PROVIDED THE- AT THE INFORMATION AND THE EXPERTISE TO BRING IT TO THE ACCUSATION LEVEL. SO THE SO THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK. WAS DONE AT THE EARLIEST STAGE THAT WE HAD THE INFORMATION TO ACT UPON. IS IT IS THIS A FAILURE OF THE BOARD. WELL OKAY WELL I WOULD WELCOME HAD OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK BACK IN TIME AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING TEN YEARS AGO AND TO LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THAT THE BOARD HAD AVAILABLE TO ITSELF. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SEVERITY OF THE ACCUSATIONS THERE IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A CRIMINAL LAW MATTER PRIMARILY AND THAT'S I THINK WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK AT IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATION INITIATIONS CONTACT WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES FAILURE TO REPORT THEIR- OKAY AND I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO LOOK AT. WHAT INFORMATION. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAD TEN YEARS AGO AND TO SEE IF WE HAD A BASIS TO TAKE ACTION BACK THEN WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOES YOUR BOARD VICE PRESIDENT I DON'T WANNA GET INTO SEMANTICS TELLS A LOT OF WORDS I JUST ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION IS THIS A FAILURE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD YES OR NO.

NO NO NO NO I JUST I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THE THAT ALTMAN AUTHORITY. I JUST ABOUT IT I DON'T WANNA GET INTO SEMANTICS THIS IS JUST ABOUT VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD. HOW IS IT THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE DETAILS OF THIS CASE. BEING THAT IT WAS MADE PUBLIC BUT A MONTH AGO. AND YOU KNOW WITH JIM KNEW THAT WE WERE HAVING AND- OVERSIGHT HEARING. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE OKAY WHAT I KNOW ARE THE DETAILS OF WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS DONE. AND THAT'S IN THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS THERE. NOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO IS TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TEN YEARS AGO WHAT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. AND SHOULD THAT OR SHOULD THAT NOT HAVE BEEN THE BASIS FOR AN ACTION BY THE MEDICAL BOARD. I DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY SPEAK THE AND THEN AND THE NEW WHO IF YOU WILL NOT TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION IS THE FAILURE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD THEN WHOSE FAILURE IS IT. I TRIED ANSWERED YOUR CARRILLO MAY I THINK THIS IS CHRISTINA OFTEN. BUT MY QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND I LIKE TO ASK DIRECTLY TO THE PERSON WHO IS ACCEPTED OWNERSHIP. I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION SENATOR. I WILL NOT BE BULLIED INTO MAKING ANY KIND OF STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NO BASIS IN FACT. AND I SPEAK NO NO NO NO IT THE DATE THANK YOU ALL OF FINALLY SAY THAT IF YOUR INTERPRETATION IS THAT OF ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESTATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE ARE DOING OUR JOB. THE NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL JOB OF OVERSIGHT THAN IT IS TO BE INTERPRETED SUCH THAT WE ARE ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS ON THE FAILURES OF THE WORK THAT AND WITH THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU. AND THAT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO BE ABLE TO DO IF YOU'RE ILL EQUIPPED TO BE PREPARED YOU'LL SEE SUBSEQUENT OVERSIGHT HEARINGS FOR US TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE SINCE YOU'VE TAKEN OWNERSHIP AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU. MAY I SPEAK. THE VILLAGE VENTURA. MAY I SPEAK ABSOLUTELY PUT YOU HAS IS NOT OF YOUR AN OPPORTUNITY RESPOND. MANY OF THE IN YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE- I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE BRONX AND SOMETIMES- I'M CYNICAL AND SARCASTIC AND- SOMETIMES I APPEAR TO BE CONDESCENDING BUT- NO COMMENT THAT I MADE TODAY. WAS INTENDED TO BE CONDESCENDING AND IF I COME OFF THAT WAY I HUMBLY APOLOGIZE I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT. FOR THE COMMITTEE AND FOR THE PROCESS THAT E'RE GOING THROUGH TODAY SO NEVER HESITATE TO CALL ME ON NOT HAN HOW I BEHAVE. SECOND OF ALL AS I WITNESSED THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN SAN ANGELO AND MR PACIFICA. I ALSO- RESTRAINING WE WITNESS A MISUNDERSTANDING- MISTER PERCEIVE BECAUSE SEEMS TO FEEL THAT CENTER LOS QUESTION WAS DIRECTED TOWARD WHAT ACTIONS AT THE BORDER TAKE OR NOT TAKE TEN YEARS AGO. WHERE IS I HEARD SENATOR LOS QUESTION TO BE WHAT ACTION THAT THE BOARD TAKE OR NOT TAKE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE BAY AREA NEWS. IN FEBRUARY. AS SENATOR ROTH SAID EARLIER- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE TIMELINE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS CASE WE NEED TO TAKE IT AS A SENTINEL CASE AND WE NEED TO SEE STEP BY STEP. WHEN WAS THEIR PUBLIC INFORMATION WHEN WE'RE THERE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED WHEN DID THE MEDICAL BOARD BECOME AWARE OF THIS WHETHER IT BE THROUGH THE PRINT MEDIA TV NEWS OR ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN WE WILL KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT BORDER FAILED- I WOULD NOT. SIT HERE AND BE HONEST AND SAY THAT THE BOARD HAS NEVER FAILED. BUT I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US NO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AT THIS TIME. WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD FAILED- AND I WOULDN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT. SO PLEASE GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THE TIMELINE OF THIS CASE. AND THEN ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. TWENTY SIR ROBERT I MAY. JUST OFFER A COUPLE ADDITIONAL. THOUGHTS ON THAT POINT ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU- I'M ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS. THAT ARE GOING ON HERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A FAILURE OR NOT THERE CAN BE A FAILURE IN OUR PROCESS AND THE DOCTOR KRAUSS ARTICULATED WE ARE HAPPY TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND UNDERSTAND- PRECISELY BUT YES AND WHEN AND WHERE THERE WAS A FAILURE IN ONE OF OUR OUTBOARD ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THESE- BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. GOING ON HERE- WHICH IS ONE OF PUBLIC TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE BOARD AND SO IT'S EASY TO TAKE THE CASE THAT- WHERE WHERE THE PUBLIC HAS INVESTED A DEEP TRUST IN THE MEDICAL BOARD TO PROTECT THEM AND MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING OUT ON THEIR BEHALF. AND THEIR MAIN IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A FAILURE HERE TO DO THAT TO COMMUNICATE WHAT OUR PROCESS THESE ARE PERHAPS WE WEREN'T DOING A GOOD JOB ALONG THE WAY AND SO I TAKE. THAT ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES. PLEASE ALTHOUGH PUBLIC. ROLE OF COURSE OPERATE OUTSIDE OF OUR- STATUTORY AT THE WERE THE MEDICAL PRACTICE. SOME OF THE OTHER DIRECTION SO. IT IS INCUMBENT- AND I AND ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD I KNOW. ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS WOULD AGREE THAT NEEDS SOMETHING WE'RE CERTAINLY FOCUSED ON WORKING ON AN IMPROVING. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE TRUST AND CREDIBILITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO PROTECT. THANKS THANK YOU FOR THOSE REMARKS. OF MEMBER FARM. I THANK YOU CHAIR- A ROTH ENSURE LOW- I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT- THE SETTLEMENT ISSUES- AND THE ROLE OF THE BOARD- IF YOU LOOK ONPAGE SIXTY ONE OF THE ANALYSIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU- IT HIGHLIGHTS A SITUATION THAT OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT- IN KERN COUNTY- IN THE PARAGRAPH I'LL JUST READ IT FOR THOSE TO GET YOU DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF USES THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON PATIENTS STEMMING FROM SETTLEMENTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. AB ONE TWO THOUSAND POSITION ENTERED INTO A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT- FOR VIOLATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND NINETY SEVEN. THE POSITION WAS PLACED ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS. THE POSITION WAS RESTORED TO FULL LICENSE STATUS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BUT AGAIN PLACED ON PROBATION FOR FIVE YEARS BASED ON A SETTLEMENT- THE BOARD'S MOST RECENT ACCUSATION FILED AGAINST POSITION SIDES PRESS NEGLIGENCE. NEGLIGENCE AND FAILURE TO KEEP ADEQUATE AND ACCURATE RECORDS RELATED TO THE WRONGFUL DEATH OF THE PATIENT AND HER UNBORN SET LAST YEAR- SO I GUESS. COULD YOU PROVIDE SOME. CLARITY IN TERMS OF I KNOW YOU TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT HOW THAT. THE GUY DIDN'T THAT THE DESPITE GUIDELINES OURS OUR GUIDANCE IS BUT NOT- MANDATES- BUT COULD YOU AND I GUESS HIGHLIGHT. OR OR TO SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF. HOW YOU COME A CONCLUSION MAY NOT. BE AT THE LEVEL OF THAT THE GOT THE GUIDELINES AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THE BOARD MONITORS PHYSICIANS ON PROBATION- FOR SOMETHING LIKE A GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WRONGFUL DEATH ACCUSATIONS. YES WELL CERTAINLY AS WE HAVE SAID THAT THE GUIDANCE IS THERE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE SETTLEMENTS ARE DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS WE LOOK AT. THAT WE BEGIN WITH THE ACCUSATION WE LOOK AT THE EXPERT REPORTS THERE MAY BE CONTRARY EXPERT REPORTS WE LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WE ALWAYS HAVE A VIEW AS TO WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME GOING TO BE IF THERE IS NO SETTLEMENT AND IF THE CASE GOES TO HEARING. WE OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT THE OUTCOME WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CASE WAS A VERY SERIOUS. INVOLVING THE DEATH OF THE PATIENT BUT THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO FACE UP TO IS RELATED TO THE STANDARD OF CARE WHICH CANNOT BE DRIVEN EXCLUSIVELY BY THE OUTCOME. YOU CAN HAVE A VERY A POOR OUTCOME AND THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD OF CARE YOU COULD HAVE A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME. IN THERE IS AN EXTREME DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE IT'S THE STANDARD OF CARE AND THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE THAT RELATES TO DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. ON THE BASIS OF SETTLEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE CONTEXT OF EACH CASE. THERE MAY BE A VIEW TAKEN THAT THE SETTLEMENT ACHIEVED IS BETTER THAN IS LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED. IF THE CASE WERE TO GO TO HEARING. BOB ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE MONITORING OF CONDITIONS ON THE BASIS OF PROBATION. AND MAYBE IF I COULD TURN THAT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MS JONES. ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE. I'M SORRY YOUR ON THE. THE TERMS OF PROBATION AM I NOW YES AS I THOUGHT YEAH- WE HAVE PROBATION MONITORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT OVERSEE THE PROBATION TERMS OF EACH LICENSEE THAT IS ON PROBATION- THEIR ROLE IS TO INITIALLY MEET WITH THE PERSON THAT'S BEING PLACED ON PROBATION GO OVER ALL OF THE TERMS OF THE ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THERE. CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE TERMS ARE AND WHAT WILL BE EXPECTED OF THEM- AND THEN THEY HAVE QUARTERLY IN PERSON MEETINGS WITH THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE IF THEY HAVE A MONITOR THERE FOLLOWING UP WITH THE MONITOR THEY'RE REVIEWING. RECORDS REVIEWING- CHARTS- IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE TALKING TERMS OF THE ORDER REQUIRE. AND THEN AND ARE THESE MONITORS ARE THEY BASED IN EACH COUNTY OR HOW DOES OUR EXIT BY REGION OR HOW'S THAT STRUCTURE- THEY'RE BASED OUT OF THE- IN AN THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE AND THEY'RE IN THE- I AM NOT SURE IF IT WOULD BE REGION OR COUNTY- BUT THERE ARE THEY KOSHER OFFICES WITH THE H. Q. ARE YOU OFFICES- SO THERE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OKAY AND THEN- I MEAN CERTAINLY THIS IS A VERY- TRAGIC AND CONCERNING SITUATION- NOW THAT THIS IS A REPEAT IT- SITUATION SO IN TERMS OF. AND I AND I AND I GUESS GOING BACK TO THE SETTLEMENT ISSUE- IS THAT TAKE A CLEARLY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- IN TERMS OF THE GUIDELINES AND DISCIPLINE. YES SIR- AND THEN- SO HOW HOW DOES THE BOARD DETERMINED WHETHER A LICENSEE IS REHABILITATED OR FIT OR COMPETENT TO PRACTICE IT I GUESS IN THIS IN THIS EXAMPLE CITED AND DENOUNCES AND OF COURSE IN MY DISTRICT I MADE SAID THAT THE LICENSE WAS WAS REINSTATED- WHAT WHAT GOES INTO THAT PROCESS HELLO GUYS IN THAT DECISION. WELL AS WAS INDICATED THIS IS HANDLED BY THE PROBATION OFFICE THEY MONITOR ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PROBATION. N. AT THE END OF THE TERM OF PROBATION OR IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AT AN EARLIER STAGE IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL OF THE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. THEN THAT'S THE BAND THERE THEN THE ARM. ARE THE LICENSEE IS ELIGIBLE TO COME OFF PROBATION AND SO IT'S ALL DONE IN THAT CONTEXT. SO THEN. I MEAN I CERTAINLY- WANT TO KIND OF DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THAT I MEAN WHO WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE AND- THE ASSESSMENT. OF WHETHER- WHETHER A SETTLEMENT SHOULD BE- DIFFERENT FROM THE GUIDELINES- IF THE GUIDELINES ARE THERE TO BE GUIDANCE IS AND THE DECISION IS TO BE MADE TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS. NOT TO THE SAME LEVEL AS WHAT'S RECOMMENDED. I'M I'M I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE GUIDELINES IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS NOT TO THAT LEVEL. OKAY IT'S VERY SIMPLE THE GUIDELINES ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION. THAT ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CASE HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD. THERE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL FACTORS OF MEDICATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THE PROCESS BY WHICH A SETTLEMENT IS ENTERED INTO. IS THAT THE INITIAL AGREEMENT TO PROPOSE A SETTLEMENT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND THE EXECUTIVE WHICH IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND THE HEAD OF ENFORCEMENT AT THAT POINT THEN. IF WE AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION ARE WE FASHION A NEW RECOMMENDATION. IT IS GOES INTO SETTLEMENT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN AGREEMENT IF THERE IS AN AGREEMENT. THAT ULTIMATELY THAT GOES FOR REVIEW BEFORE ONE OF THE PANELS AND THE PANEL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT ARE TO QUESTION AT. OUR END WHICH WILL GO TO A HEARING. AT WHICH THE PARTIES WILL BE THERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL BE THERE TO EXPLAIN VARIOUS FACTORS THAT WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND THEN THE PANEL HAS THE ABILITY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BELLETTI TO REJECT THE SETTLEMENT SO THAT'S IF YOU WILL TO PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS THAT IS THAT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. SO IN IN IN IN THAT PROCESS AND CAN I ASK. WHO MAKES THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATION YOU AND YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS A KIND OF A- A NUMBER OF. AGENCIES ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IS IT. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MAKE A RECOMMENDATION OR IS IT A COLLECTIVE DECISION FIRST AMONGST. ON THE BOARD AND THE AG AND THEN JOKES THAT THE PANEL THE PEOPLE AT THE AT THE WAY THE GENERAL PROCESS WORKS AS AN ADDITIONAL. AN INITIAL RECOMMENDATION IS MADE TO THE EXECUTIVE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THEN THAT IS- THAT'S A MATTER OF DISCUSSION. SOMETIMES WE ACCEPTED SOMETIMES WE ACCEPTED WITH CONDITIONS- EITHER UP OR DOWN IN TERMS OF LEVEL OF SOME OF- A SEVERITY. THAT'S THE INITIAL POINT BET NOW THERE IS NO SETTLEMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES TO AGREE TO IT. THEN IT GOES TO THE OTHER PARTY THERE MAY BE SOME NEGOTIATIONS IF THERE IS NOTHING IS DONE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OFTHE EXECUTIVE THEN YOU REACH A SETTLEMENT. AND THEN IT'S. ELIGIBLE TO GO TO THE PANEL FOR REVIEW. OKAY BUT YOU STATE EARLY AND AN AND ME IF I I. FIVE ARE FROM EIGHTY FOUR PER. OF THE CASE FILE. BEFORE THE BOARD RESULT IN SETTLEMENTS. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO DO YOU DO YOU LAUGHTER. THAT WAS LAST NIGHT I'M SORRY LAST YEAR JUST TO CLARIFY THE APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. DO YOU HAVE. ENGINE IN GENERAL AND MAYBE AND I KNOW I NEED OF ME MAYBE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ME OF A SPECIFIC DATA AT SOME AT SOME POINT. MAYBE NOT HERE BUT- M. HOW HOW MANY TIMES IS IT NORMALLY ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT ADVERSITY IS IT BEING. CHANGED REJECTED OR OR IS THAT JUST AN ONGOING THING. WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND HAVE A VERY LENGTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO THEY KNOW WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND THEY REALLY HAVE INTERNALIZED A LOT OF THAT. IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN WORK. SO BY AND LARGE WE GET RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THEM FIRST OF ALL WE ALWAYS FIND THAT THEY ARE VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER. THAT THEY ARE DESERVING OF. OUR CAREFUL ANALYSIS- WE WOULDN'T REJECT THEM LIGHTLY BUT THE MEDICAL BOARD IN THE EXECUTIVES WE HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW WE HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CASES AND THERE'S A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. GIVE AND TAKE BETWEEN US AT THE END OF THE DAY THE DECISION IS WITH THE BOARD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS. OUR ADVISER WE ARE THE CLIENT BUT WE FIND THAT THEY WERE ADVISED IT'S VERY GOOD IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. AND THE ONE THING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS IS VERY FLUID INTELLIGENCE AND EXPERIENCE. DEALING WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES SO THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD INTELLIGENCE ABOUT WHAT'S THE LIKELY. OUTCOME GOING TO BE A HEARING WHICH IS VERY POOR. OKAY BUT INTERESTED I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS. THAT IT IT STATED IN THE CO LIKE A PART. OF PUBLIC HEALTH BE THE HIGH PRIORITY SO YEAH UP IN THE- DECISION. THAT IS THAT. IS THAT IS THE GOAL- I ABSOLUTELY WE DON'T AGREE ANY SETTLEMENT THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. FULL STOP. BOB NOW IS A VERY RECENT CASE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF IT. BUT THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT IT SHOULD GO TO SETTLEMENT. AT THE VIEW WAS ARE THAT THE THAT THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL AND WE SAID NO SIMPLY BECAUSE- WITHOUT IT YOU GO TO A HEARING THERE WAS A CONFLICT THE FACT. NOW IT IS NOT CLEAR. HOW THAT WILL BE RESOLVED. ALL THESE CASES ARE BLACK AND WHITE. BUT I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CON. CONFLICT THE FACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A HEARING. BECAUSE LET THE FACT FINDER MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T DO JUST ON THE BASIS OF A PAPER SETTLEMENT. SO WE HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS BUT THAT'S A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE THANK. WE GET GOOD ADVICE WE RESPECT THE ADVICE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MEDICAL BOARD MAKES THE DECISION. AND AGAIN WE DON'T RECOMMEND ANY SETTLEMENT UNLESS IT'S IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. DO YOU AND I KNOW THAT I NOTED I KNOW TO NOTICE THAT YOU HAD A NUMBER OF REFORMS- IN YOUR POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. AND ARE THERE ADDITIONAL REFORMS TO THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT THAT WOULD IMPROVE. PATIENT PROTECTION DO YOU SEE- AND ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE DNE- AS THE PROCESS CONTINUES THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUE FROM KERN COUNTY INTO THE SENATOR FOLLOWING YOU WILL PROBABLY BE. ASKING VERY SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT REPEATED SITUATIONS AND NEGLIGENCE. THESE ARE AN UP AND OF COURSE THE RESULT OF WRONGFUL DEATH IS TRAGIC AND- OTHER REFORMS THAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE. THIS PROCESS OKAY WELL FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED ANY SUCH REFORMS IN THE CURRENT SUNSET PROPOSAL. BUT I CAN CERTAINLY ASSURE YOU. THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA. AND THAT WE ARE. WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY CONSTRUCTIVE. ADVICE OR DECISIONS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. OUT WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AGAIN THE SETTLEMENTS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE FOR US OF CERTAINTY. AND THAT WE KNOW WE ARE GOING TO GET. A SOLUTION WHICH PROTECTS THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ABSENCE OF SETTLEMENTS AND MANY OF THE CASES. BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN. TO CONSIDERING IMPROVEMENTS OF THE PROCESS BUT NONE OF THOSE ARE PART. OF OUR CURRENT SUNSET PROPOSED. AND I POLICIES ARE JUMPING OVER BY YOU WANT ASK THIS QUESTION WHEN IT TO PROVIDE- IS THAT NORMALLY DOES THAT NORMALLY LIMIT A POSITION THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. IS THAT OR IS THAT PART OF. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS WELL. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS LIMIT THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. OF MANY TIMES THERE ARE CONDITIONS THAT ARE PUT WHETHER IT'S TRAINING THERE COULD BE A- MANDATORY TESTING IN THE APPROPRIATE CASES. SOMETIMES THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON PRACTICE SOMETIMES THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON SOLO PRACTICE- THERE'S REQUIRING A PRACTICE MONITOR BUT THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THE CONDITIONS ARE TAILOR MADE. BASED ON THE CASE. THAT THE OUR- CONDITIONS AROSE OUT OF. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR I WOULD SAY THAT PROBABLY MAYBE THE AREA THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS THE MONITORING PART AND MAYBE DO THAT BETTER- HE SAID IT WAS A QUARTERLY MEETINGS AND- CHECK INS AND- THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE OF US BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE INFORMATION THANK YOU SHARE ROSS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK MEMBER FONG CENTER TYLER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE IF- I'M A BIT SCATTERED HERE AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE A LOT OF- PAPERWORK AND THEREFORE. A LOT OF QUESTIONS. OF I KNOW THE PERHAPS THE SOME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH ME I SENT IN A LETTER AT. WHAT IF SEVERAL QUESTIONS. OF IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. ARE NOT FULLY HAPPY WITH THE ANSWERS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO ME SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND ASK SOME OF THOSE AGAIN. I DO WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT I PULLED OUT OF THE WEBSITE THE DC WEBSITE. OF THE COMPLAINTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 292-019-2020 A THE BOARD RECEIVED TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT COMPLAINTS. AND THEY CLOSED- TWELVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THREE BUY THE COMPLETE UNIT- MY FIRST QUESTION IS CAN YOU PLEASE- EXPLAIN. GIVE US AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE COMPLAINT UNIT DOES THE ROLE HOW DO THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF. OF CLOSING EIGHT COMPLAINT THAT WAS SENT TEN BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID IT WAS ABOUT 8085% OF. THAT YOU KNOW THAT ARE CLOSED DURING YOU KNOW IT WITHIN THIS UNIT. BUT I MEAN ARE THE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE LIST CLAIMS THEN AT THIS POINT I MEAN WHAT WHAT GOES INTO DETERMINING- CLOSING THE CASE WITHIN THE UNIT- THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- THIS IS JENNA JONES AGAIN SO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE INITIAL REVIEW OF A COMPLAINT OR MATTER- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TO THE TEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS THAT WERE RECEIVED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY- THERE MAY BE CASES PENDING FROM THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR- SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE NUMBER. INCREASED TO THE TWELVE THOUSAND FIGURE YOU PRESENTED BECAUSE WE HAVE CASES THAT ARE STILL PENDING REVIEW AND FINALIZATION OR DETERMINATION SO THAT'S WHERE THE NUMBER CAN BE INCREASED NOW THE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS THAT MAY BE CLOSED AT THE INITIAL REVIEW. MAY INCLUDE CASES THAT WERE. I'M NOT USING CASES AND COMPLAINTS TO SYNONYMOUSLY I'M SORRY IF THAT CAUSES ANY CONFUSION BUT- A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE OUR OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION THEY EITHER NEED TO GO TO THE NURSING BOARD. THE OSTEOPATHIC BOARD- OR ONE OF THE OTHER ALLIED HEALTH BOARDS SO. WE IDENTIFY THOSE AS NOT BEING LICENSED WITH OUR AGENCY OR UNDER OUR- AREA AND WE'RE GONNA REFER THOSE OUT SO LAST YEAR I BELIEVE. THAT WAS. WELL THAT'S A DIFFERENT CRAP I'M SORRY- THERE IS APPROXIMATELY. THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF OUR JURISDICTION- I'M SORRY NON JURISDICTIONAL LAST YEAR WERE SIXTEEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR- IT ALSO WE MAY NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER IT MAY BE A BILLING ISSUE- IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT- AND THEN- SO YOU. THE INITIAL REVIEW ALSO INCLUDES IF WE GET AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE A PATIENT NAMED TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOMEBODY THAT WE CAN GO TO OR GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- THE ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT CAN BE. A HUGE AN AMOUNT OF OUR INCOMING COMPLAINTS. AND THEREFORE. SOMETIMES A NUMBER OF THOSE ARE CLOSED- IT THERE'S JUST A LOT OF FACTORS INVOLVED SOMETIMES WE WILL SEND A REQUEST FOR RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS AND WE SEND A COUPLE OF REALLY REQUEST AND WE DON'T GET A RESPONSE- BUT IS THERE A PROCESS INCLUDE REVIEWS THESE COMPLAINTS YEAH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT AND WHAT WHAT IS THIS THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE FOR DETERMINING WHERE A CASE FOR A COMPLAINT. SHOULD EVEN BE FILED OR MOVE TOWARDS A DETAIL OR IS OUT OF THE JURISDICTION OKAY SO WHEN THE COMPLAINT FIRST HITS OUR OFFICER IT'S GOING TO GO TO OUR TRIAGE UNIT WHICH IS CALLED THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT. THAT IS THEIR ROLE IS TO TRIAGE THAT COMPLAINT OR AMOUNT OF INFORMATION OF TV REPORT- NEWS ARTICLE THE- MALPRACTICE REPORT. AN ARREST REPORT IT WHATEVER THAT MAY BE THAT IS EVALUATED BY THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT AND STARTED ON THE PROCESS. OF MOVING TOWARDS. THE BEING SENT MORE. BUT OUR INITIAL STEPS ARE. BUT THE MAJORITY ARE IN THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT THERE PUT IT THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE CLOSED WITHIN THIS UNIT SO I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT WHO ARE THE DECISION MAKERS WITHIN THIS UNIT THAT. MAKE THE DECISION TO CLOSE THE A COMPLAINT- THE ANALYSTS WE HAVE A STAFF OF ANALYSTS AND MANAGERS AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE REVIEWING THE CASES WE ALSO SEND THOSE CASES BEFORE A MEDICAL CONSULTANT GROUP- AND THEY'RE HELPING US REVIEW THE CASES TO DETERMINE IF THE CASES. APPEAR TO HAVE A POSSIBLE VIOLATION. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT COMPLAINT DOESN'T GO TO A MEDICAL CONSULTANT AND LESS IT'S- CONSIDERED NOW AN INVESTIGATION IS THAT ACCURATE- THAT IS. NOT ACCURATE HE CASES THAT WE RECEIVE THE RECORDS ON THAT WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN RECORDS ON AND WE FEEL THAT THERE MAY BE AT A POSSIBLE VIOLATION. THOSE ALL GO TO A MEDICAL CONSULTANT REVIEW- THE EX. THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT REVIEW IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE OF THE STATUES TWENTY TO TWENTY POINT AWAIT WHERE SOMEONE WHO HAS SIMILAR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE REVIEWS THE RECORD RECORD SOME SORRY AND DETERMINES IF THERE'S A POSSIBLE VIOLATION IN THE MATTER. AND THAT IS ONCE WE CLEARED THAT HURDLE THEN THE CASE GOES OUT TO H. Q. ARE YOU OVER CHAU. FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. OKAY AND I KNOW YOU DID MENTION AT THE BEGINNING THERE THAT THERE'S ANALYSTS AND MANAGERS A TRIAGE WITHIN THE- COMPLETE UNIT. RIGHT YES DO YOU DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE- THEY ARE THEY'RE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE PROOF FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE STANDARD OF CARE- THIS PRODUCT- CENTER THEY'RE NOT DETERMINING THE STANDARD OF CARE THEY'RE VALUING IT TO PRESENT IT TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT WHO IS A LICENSED PHYSICIAN WHO WILL BE DETERMINING OF A STANDARD. OF CARE WAS VIOLATED. BUT SOME DON'T GO TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANTS RATE I MEAN THEY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IF IT GOES TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT NEXT. AS AT ARBOR. WELL IF IT'S AS IF IT'S SOME A SITUATION WHERE- OFFICE STAFF WERE RUDE TO THE ALLEGE THE ALLEGATION IS THAT THE STAFF FROM OF CLINICAL RUDE OR SOMETHING YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WOULD NOT GO TO A MEDICAL CONSULTANT AND THAT IS THE CASE THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE JURISDICTION ON- IF IT'S- REGARDING A PHYSICIAN'S CARE SO YOU KNOW IT YES I'M NOT GONNA SAY EVERY CASE GOES TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT. BUT IF IT'S INVOLVING PATIENT CARE YES IT IS GOING TO THE MEADOW WALKER SENATE WOULD YOU SAY AND THE POINT AT THAT THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT. OF THE THAT. I WOULD BE HAPPY RESEARCH SEVEN GET YOUR NUMBER I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH TODAY THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE REGARDING THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT AND OR WHEN A COMPLAINT GOES TO- THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT IS THERE ANY SCREENING- THAT IS DONE THROUGH THE NATIONAL PRACTITIONER DATA BANK- WE RECEIVED COMPLAINTS- WE RECEIVE REPORTS ON THE NATIONAL PRACTITIONER DATA BANK AND WE INITIATE COMPLAINTS FROM THOSE. BUT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT PROCESS. AS A CHEN USUALLY NAY STARTED ANOTHER OUT OF STATE PRACTICE OR OUT OF STATE ACTION. WHICH ONE CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT FOR TO MYSELF AND OTHERS LISTEN IN AND- ABSOLUTELY SO IF. WE RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL PRACTITIONER DATA BANK- THAT COULD BE- ACTION TAKEN BY A HOSPITAL- WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP AND SEE IF WE ALREADY HAVE AN EIGHT OO. FIVE PORT WHICH IS A MANDATORY REPORT ON THAT- IT MAY ALSO BE AN OUT OF STATE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST A POSITION AND THAT'S GOING TO BE INITIATED AND- COMPLAINTS GOING TO BE INITIATED BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CONSIDERED AN OUT OF STATE. CASE AND THAT THAT'S WHEN WE START GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER STATE- AND WE TAKE. A LOOK AT JURISDICTION TO OBTAIN ALL OF THE RECORDS FROM THE HOSPITALS IN THOSE STATES BUT WE'RE ATTAINING ANY OTHER STATES ACTION THAT THEY TOOK AGAINST THE LICENSEE AND MOVING FORWARD IF. FORWARD WITH A COMPLAINT OR CASE BASED ON THAT MATTER BUT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO GO INTO THE DATABASE AND- LOOK UP A DOCTOR THAT. MAYBE ARE THERE'S A COMPLAINT ABOUT IN FRONT OF YOU AND GET BACKGROUND OF INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN THE PAST. AND SOME OTHER STATE IN REGARDS TO THIS DOCTOR. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE THAT IN OUR DATABASE. SO ARE YOU REVIEWING YOUR DATABASE. AT THE MOMENT AND DOES THAT HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT- A DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN OTHER STATES. IF IT'S BEEN REPORTED THROUGH THE NATIONAL BACK PRACTITIONER DATABANK YES IT'S GOING TO BE IN OUR DATABASE SO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN TERMS OF THE DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE TRIAGE- WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE ENTIRE HISTORY YES- IT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT THE MATTER WAS IS IT CURRENT IS IT TEN YEARS AGO- SO IT'S GOING TO BE EVALUATED. BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUIT DEPENDS ON THE DETAILS INVOLVED. N. E. I KNOW THAT YOU THERE WAS MENTION OF- SOME SORT OF A DOCUMENT THAT YOU RECEIVED OR OR NOTIFICATION IF THERE'S A YOU KNOW AN INDIVIDUAL THAT RECEIVED- DISCIPLINARY ACTION IT AND OTHER STATE OR BEEN YOU LOOK INTO IT AND THEN YOU. I'M I'M ASSUMING TO REVOKE THE LICENSE AT THAT POINT- IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE DISCIPLINE TAKEN ANY OTHER STATE- IF THEY WERE GIVEN A PUBLIC REPRIMAND- THAT WOULD WE USUALLY GENERALLY FOLLOW WHAT THE OTHER STATE HAS DONE- WITH OUR OWN ACTION. IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ACTION TAKEN AND THE OTHER STATE. I DON'T WANT TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT IT TOOK THAT BACK TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANTS- THE MMHM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE IN TERMS OF THE MEDICAL CONSULTANTS YOU HAVE THAT THE PERMANENT INTERMITTENT OR THE PART TIME CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEIR ACTUAL ROLE IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY STATE EMPLOYEES HOW OFTEN THEY COME AND HOME AND I KNOW YOU THERE WAS MENTION THAT THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY THREE CONSULTANCY HAVE MET. MEDICAL CONSULTANTS. FROM THE MEDICAL CONSULTANTS FOR THE MOST PART ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS- THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTORS MORE THAN THIRTY THREE YOU MAY BE SPEAKING. WE HAVE A FULL PANEL OF MEDICAL CONSULTANTS YOU MAY BE FOCUSING ON THE NUMBER THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE H. Q. WHY YOU. ANSWERED THEM DIRECTLY WE DO HAVE A CHIEF MEDICAL CONSULTANT- THAT IS ON STAFF. BUT THE OTHER MEDICAL CONSULTANTS THAT WERE FOR IN THESE CASES TO ARE NOT FULL TIME. EMPLOYEES OF THE BOARD THEY'RE ALL CONTRACTORS. SO THEIR CONTRACT EMPLOYEES ARE NOT STATE EMPLOYEES IS THAT CORRECT. YES MA'AM. OKAY AND ANOTHER IS ALSO EXPERT REVIEWERS ARE THOSE CONTRACT EMPLOYEES AS WELL. YES MA'AM THEY ARE. AND HOW MANY EXPERT REVIEWERS DO YOU HAVE. I BELIEVE THE LAST NUMBER IN THE POOL WAS SOMEWHERE OVER. SIX HUNDRED. OVER SIX HUNDRED YES MA'AM. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE FOR SPECIALTY- I COULD GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU I DO NOT HAVE THAT. AT THIS MOMENT. I WANNA ALSO JUST BRIEFLY MENTION- THAT RIGHT SORRY I REPRESENTED THE PARTS OF A FRESNO TULARE KINGS AND KERN COUNTIES I DID SOME MORE OR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH- I LOOKED THROUGH THE ACT OF LICENSES WITH DISCIPLINARY ACTION- WITH NO PUBLIC DOCUMENT THERE'S- ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT ACTIVE LICENSES WITH DISCIPLINARY ACTION BUT- AND WITH A PUBLIC DOCUMENT AVAILABLE THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY SIX- IT ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT THERE WERE. IN FORTY LICENSES THAT WERE SURRENDERED BUT SOME AFTER THE FACT. AND I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON THIS JUST A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BACK WHEN YOU GET THE NOTIFICATION THE NATIONAL NOTIFICATION THEN YOU TAKE ACTION AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THE CASE AND SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED EARLIER IF YOU LOOKED INTO THEN. IF YOU DID. KIND OF LIKE IN A PERMANENT WAY IT LOOKED AT THE DATA BASE TO LOOK AT THAT- LOOK UP DOCTORS THAT HAVE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM- BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION. THAT IS BEING- IT COLLECTED FROM THE ERRORS THAT WERE INFORMING OURSELVES- FROM THE FROM THE NATIONAL. DATABASE SO WANTED JUST TO POINT THAT OUT. BUT IT JUST A STATEMENT. I'M NOT. YEAH THANK YOU. JUST. SO I NOTED IN MY ORIGINAL- QUESTION- IT OR THE LETTER THAT I SENT LAST YEAR THE ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED WAS CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE A REVIEW OF WHY LICENSE REVOCATION WAS. ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED AS PART OF A DISCIPLINARY ACTION BUT WAS NOT ISSUED CAN YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR OR OUR RESPONSE TO THAT. IF I CAN TAKE THAT UP SENATOR IT'S THE FORM OF PLEADING THAT IS DONE AS PART OF THE LEGAL PROCESS IN THE ACCUSATION STAGE IS THAT WE SET OUT A WHOLE RANGE OF WHAT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS MAY BE AVAILABLE. BUT IT'S ONLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION- THAT WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE AS TO WHAT IS ACHIEVABLE SO IT IS ROUTINELY STATED AND ACCUSATIONS THAT ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS REVOCATION. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE APPROPRIATE SANCTION. THERE WERE A TOPIC I WANTED TO KIND OF COVERS PROBATION. WHEN THE WHEN THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN DISCIPLINED AND THERE'S SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY MONITORS MONITORS THEM LOCALLY. WHY WHY ARE THE NAMES KEPT CONFIDENTIAL I MEAN IF I AM MADE- I MEET CONSUMER RIGHT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GO TO THE RIGHT DOCTOR BUT THERE'S A DOCTOR THAT'S BEEN- DISCIPLINE IN MY REGION. I MEAN IF I HAVE EVEN A COMPLAINT ABOUT A DOCTOR OR- HAVE SOME CONCERNS HOW DO. I MEAN HOW DO I USE EXPRESSES CONCERNS IF WE'D HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS. YOU MEAN WHO THAT PRATT WHO THE PROBATION MONITORS. IT IS THE ONE THAT WORKS DIRECTLY WITH THE DOCTOR. LOCALLY. IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE CALLED PROBATION MONITORS- SO B. BOARD EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE READ MONITORING THE DOCTORS ON PROBATION WOULD BE OUR PROBATION MONITORS- I AM. NOT AWARE THAT SHE OR THAT INDIVIDUAL IS. HAS NOT BEEN- I UNDERSTAND THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS HAD CONTACT WITH- A HIGH PROFILE CASE THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO- BUT I WAS NOT AWARE THAT- THEIR IDENTITY WAS CONFIDENTIAL. SO THE SOUL PROBATION MONITORS INFORMATION IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL IT'S PUBLIC RECORD IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. I COULD I CAN HAVE ACCESS OR IF I CALL AND I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION IF I REQUESTED. MMHM I WILL DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT. YOU CAN. MAY I GET BACK TO YOU ON THE- THANK. DO YOU HAVE ANY GUIDELINES- SET UP. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KIND OF JUST IT'S A CASE BY CASE BASIS BUT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF GUIDELINES THAT YOU USED TO ISSUE CITATIONS UNDER PROBATION. YES. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT. IF AN INDIVIDUAL ON PROBATION IS DETERMINED TO NOT BE COMPLYING WITH SOME OF THE EITHER. A SPECIFIC TERM- OF A PROBATIONARY ORDER- THE FIRST STEP IS A CITATION PROCESS DEPENDING ON THE- THE EXTENT OF THE VIOLATION- BUT IF A CITATION MAY BE UTILIZED. TO ADDRESS NONCOMPLIANCE. NOW DID IT DOES THE CONSUMER HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUY ALL THE I DON'T KNOW DID SOME SORT OF. IF THERE'S AN OUTCOME AND A PARTICULAR COMPLAINT AND OR KEYS DOES A CONSUMER HAVE THE ABILITY TO. DISAGREE WITH THAT OUTCOME AND IT. PETITION ONCE AGAIN. THE INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS MAY CERTAINLY WRITE US AND LET US KNOW- THAT THEIR OWN HAPPIER DISPLEASED WITH THE FINAL OUTCOME. BUT. AS FAR AS AMENDING THAT OUTCOME. I AM NOT AWARE THAT THAT. IS AN OPTION. BECAUSE THE MATTER IS ALREADY BECOME PUBLIC AND HAS BEEN FINALIZED. WELL I'M CERTAINLY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AFTER THE FACT I MEAN ISN'T THIS FORD ABOUT PATIENT PROTECTION. YES MA'AM. BUT THERE IS A PROCESS FOR DOCTORS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF THING IF THEY'RE IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE OUTCOME THEY CAN FILE. ARE A SYMPTOM OF. YES A COUNTER COMPLAINT IS THAT ACCURATE SENATOR I COULD ADDRESS THAT QUESTION- IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE POINTED OUT TO WHAT HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF THOUGHT IS AN ANOMALY IN THE ACT. BASICALLY THE COMPLAINANT IS THE MEDICAL BOARD- THE DOCTOR IS THE RESPONSE THAT IF THE DOCTORS ARE HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME THERE IS NO RIGHT OF APPEAL THERE'S NO SUCH RIGHT OF APPEAL ABOUT THE COMPLAINANTS NOW IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HAVE ANOTHER BOARD. WHICH HAS A RIGHT TO APPEAL DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF PUBLIC PROTECTION AND PARTICULARLY ON THE BASIS THAT THERE THAT THE SANCTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THERE'S A BODY CALLED THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AUTHORITY A SORT OF A REGULATOR OF REGULATORS WHICH HAS THAT ROLE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO RIGHT IF THE COMPLAINANT. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE PATIENT TO APPEAL RIGHT. THAT'S MY DIRECT. MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT PROPORTION OF CASES INVESTIGATED BY THE BORDER CASES INVOLVED PATIENTS USING MEDIC CALPERS IS COMMERCIAL INSURERS. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION CENTER WILL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO GET IT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S CAPTURED ON OUR DATABASE ANYWHERE. WELL I HAVE. BE HERE ALL DAY AND ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- BUT I WILL- IT LEAVE IT AT THE MOMENT AS AS AS THANK YOU FOR. YOUR ANSWERS. WELCOME THANK CENTER TELL A MEMBER GRAYSON. FOLLOWED BY SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU CHAIR OFTEN ALSO CHAIR ROLE ROUTE LOWS WELL AND I UNDERSTAND TODAY'S HEARING THE SUBJECT MATTER IS SPECIFICALLY ON ENFORCEMENT AND SO IN REFERENCE TO YOUR POWER POINT- THE SLIDE- RIGHT BEFORE THE LAST ONE. IT TOUGH TALKS ABOUT FORMS REQUIRED AND FIRST A STATEMENT AND THAT IS ASSEMBLY THIS THAT HAVING HEARD THE TESTIMONY AND THE BACK AND FORTH ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE NEWS ARTICLE- I NOW SEE THE FIRST BULLET POINT AS CLOSER ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN NBC. AND THE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT. AS UNDER INSTITUTIONAL AS A REFORM REQUIRED- THAT STATEMENT THERE SPEAKS VOLUMES NOW AND I WOULD EVEN PROBABLY INCLUDE THE- OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS FAR AS CLOSER ENGAGEMENT MY QUESTION IS- THE SECOND BALANCES INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. FROM SWORN TO NON SWORN STAFF- WHAT WOULD BE. THE BENEFIT FOR THE IMPROVEMENT THAT THE BOARD IS EXPECTING OR LOOKING FOR FROM HAVING INCREASE FLEXIBILITY AND WHAT EXACTLY DOES IN FLEET THE INCREASE FLEXIBILITY. AND RESOURCES OF MEAN. YEAH I WILL BE HAPPY TO BEGIN THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION- THERE IS A CONCERN THAT WE'RE HAVING. SWORN OFFICERS IN TOO MANY CASES TO DO WORK THAT COULD BE DONE BY NON SWORN OFFICERS. THE EFFECT OF THIS IS THE DIRECT EFFECT ON COST AND ON TIME. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AS THIS IS IN THE BACKDROP OF THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT HAS IT- LOOMING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. IS TO DEAL WITH EACH CASE APPROPRIATELY WE BELIEVE HAT MORE CASES CAN BE DEALT WITH IN A NON ADVERSARIAL FASHION. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN BE SETTLED AT AN EARLIER STAGE AND- REMEDIATION CAN BE INITIATED FASTER AND IN MORE CASES. SIMILARLY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY OF THE ADVERSARIAL CASES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED BY NON SWORN. PERSONNEL FASTER AND IN A MORE OF THE DAY THE GOAL HERE IS TO FREE UP RESOURCES FOR THE VERY DIFFICULT CASES THE VERY SERIOUS CASES. MANY OF WHICH CAN BE QUITE COMPLICATED WITCHER VERY STRENUOUSLY CONTESTED AND WE NEED TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES FOR THOSE SO THAT'S. THE GOAL IN ALL OF THESE REFORMS. FOR THANK YOU ROOM GRAYSON DUCT FAN. I THANK YOU AS CHAIRMAN OF- FREESHEET THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO ASK A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT- FIRST QUESTION ACTUALLY SOLD A FOLLOW UP FROM A SERVER TIED UP SO- CERTAINLY- CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A PHYSICIAN WHO IS FOUND TO BE- DECISION OR NEGLIGENT- WHICH IS A PLACED ON PROBATION AND THEIR PRACTICE NEEDS TO BE SUPERVISED. NOW I KNOW IN ONE CASE OF A PHYSICIAN WHO- BASICALLY CHAU POOR DOCUMENTATION ALSO HAD A RECORD OF- READY INAPPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINATIONS THAT- PART OF THE BOARD'S DISCIPLINE INCLUDED A- AT THE PROVISION INCLUDED SUPERVISION. BY ANOTHER PHYSICIAN BUT INTERESTING ENOUGH HE GOT TO SELECT A POSITION HE WAS SUPERVISING HIM DURING HIS PROBATION IS THAT NORMAL COURSE FOR THE BOARD I FIND THAT- WHY WOULD THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE VIOLATION YOU GET TO PICK THE PERSON WHO GETS TO WATCH. THIS PERFORMANCE. GOING TO THE FUTURE DURING PROBATION- SENATOR PAM I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY PRESENTS THE LICENSEE PRESENTS. OPTIONS TO THE PRACTICE MANAGER- I'M SORRY TO THE PROBATION MONITOR- AND IT SAY. PROCESS. THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF EVALUATION AND- UNDERSTANDING- THEY CAN'T BE THEY CAN'T WORK WITH THEM THEY CAN'T BE RELATED TO- IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT AN ARM'S LENGTH- WELL THAT THAT WASN'T CERTAINLY INDICATING THE DOCUMENTATION I THINK IT'S APROPOS TO SEND HER TARDIS QUESTION. SHOULDN'T THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY PERHAPS WORKING WITH LOCAL PROFESSIONALS SIZE SUPPORT AND THEN A FINE INDEPENDENT MONITOR INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE VERY PHYSICIAN HE'S BEING PUT ON PROBATION TO IDENTIFY THEIR OWN MONITOR. YES I WILL- I AGREE WITH YOU AND I WILL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT I MEAN I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THEY HAVE TO BE OBSOLETE EXCEPT YOU'RE ASKING THE VERY PERSONS BEING PUNISHED TO IDENTIFY SOME. INITIAL CANDIDATES THAT'S NOT ARMS LIKE THAT POINT AS SOON AS THEY'RE INVOLVED IT'S NOT ARMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. NO MATTER WHO THEY BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT PERSON'S EXACTLY AN OBJECTIVE PERSON TO ADD BE ASKING. WHO SHOULD MONITOR THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES. OKAY I'M GLAD WE HAVE AGREEMENT HERE- THE SECOND ONE ACTUALLY IN THE SAME CASE IS INTERESTING THAT- YOU KNOW THERE WERE SEVERAL AGAIN APPRECIATE- AND THIS. THE YOU KNOW SEVERAL STEPS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD DID TAKE BUT ONE THE FASTENING PARTS THOUGH WAS IS THAT- YOU KNOW. THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT LED TO HIS. HIS BEING SANCTIONED WAS NOT ACTUALLY PROHIBITED FOR HIM DOING IN THE FUTURE. SO IT WASN'T BANNED FROM WRITING FOR THEIR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS NOW SUBSEQUENT LAW HAS CHANGED THAT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT- SHOULDN'T THE PERSON WHO. IS DEFICIENT. IN THE AREA THAT THEY WERE ARE BEING. RELATIONS SHOULD THERE BE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SOME CITY YOU KNOW SHOULDN'T BE SANCTIONED ALSO INVOLVE AT LEAST CERTAINLY IF IT'S NOT. ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PATIENT CARE DUTIES- NOT ENGAGING IN THE VERY BEHAVIOR THAT TRIGGERED THE REASON THAT THEY'RE BEING PLACED ON. PROBATION ARE THE OBVIOUS HERE LET'S BY SUSPEND THEY CAN'T BUT THEY BEING PLACED ON PROBATION SHOULD THAT BE ALWAYS INCLUDED IN THE US SANCTIONS FOR THE POSITION. CERTIFICATION IF I COULD INTERJECT HERE ALL OF THESE SETTLEMENTS AND SANCTIONS ARE VERY MUCH HE SPOKE THE RISE OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE IT MAY BE THE CASE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF CASES THAT THERE IS A IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A PROHIBITION ORDER IN RELATION TO THE CONDUCT UNDER QUESTION THAT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE IN EVERY CASE IN FACT I WOULD THINK PROHIBITION SOME PRACTICE OR SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE MORE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE FACTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE. WE WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IN THE ANY MORE DETAIL THAT IN THE INDIVIDUAL CASE BUT JUST TO SAY THAT THE SANCTIONS THEY ARE MEANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO THE FACT THAT WELL IN THE SOME OF THE SAME WAY- DAHLE GO ACROSS TO THE SAME FORMULA OKAY WELL I UNDERSTAND THERE'S IN THE FORMULA BUT LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY IF FURTHER SANCTION HAS TO DEAL WITH THEIR- ABUSE OF THEIR AUTHORITY THE LICENSE AUTHORITY- THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH RADIOWORKS ENABLES FRAUD- AND- IT ISN'T DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ACTUAL TERROR OF- YOU KNOW THERE'S. A PROVISION OF CLINICAL CARE. I THINK SOMEONE ENGAGE IN THAT SHOULD BE PER. FROM BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO THEY LET'S SAY- MISS CERTIFIED DISABILITY PAYMENTS- DAY- MET YOU KNOW PROVIDED THE INCORRECT- INFORMATION- TO. STATE AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES- USING THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW. PATIENTS TO ESSENTIALLY- EITHER RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES OR BENEFITS THEY WERE ENTITLED TO OR- BE ABLE TO PERFORM YOU KNOW. THAT THAT IS A PUT OTHER PEOPLE AT RISK SO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION TO YOUR AGENCY OF THE STATE. THAT WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EITHER. OUR COMMUNITIES OR- CONTINUE TO DEFRAUD THE THAT THE THAT THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY WERE BEING A- WELL THE REASON THAT THE CLIENTS. AND WONDER REASONS ARE BEING SANCTIONED. THIS SENATOR I CAN ASSURE YOU. THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A FRESH LOOK AT THESE CASES. ISSUES OF FINANCIAL FRAUD OR THINGS THAT COME TO FREQUENTLY BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD. I TAKE THE VIEW OF PRETTY MUCH CLOSE TO ZERO TOLERANCE. POSITION IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT ARISE ONE IS THE FINANCIAL FRAUD. IT BECAUSE IT'S A FRAUD AS YOU IDENTIFIED ON THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. SECONDLY I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS THAT A PHYSICIAN WHO COMMITS FINANCIAL FRAUD. IS WELL NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT REALLY SHOULD BE A PHYSICIAN FULL STOP IT IS LIKELY NOT TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE TO PATIENTS SO I CAN ASSURE YOU WE TAKE THESE THINGS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION. IN THESE TYPES OF CASES AND WE HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO HAVE MUCH MORE. STRENUOUS AND STRICT APPROACHES TO THESE CASES I THINK THERE ARE SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS CASES THAT COME BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DEAL WITH THEM. IN THE IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY WHICH IN MANY CASES. WILL HAVE TO BE REVOCATION SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE ISSUE OF SANCTIONS IN THESE TYPES OF CASES I APPRECIATE THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY EVERYTHING ON PROBATION WHICH JUST REVOKED LICENSE- SO- AND I REALIZE THAT THERE'S CHALLENGES FOR YOU AS YOU'VE EXPLAINED- TO. INITIALLY GO DOWN THAT PATH ENTIRELY BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO BE SURE THAT MEDICAL BOARD NOT ONLY OF COURSE PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS BUT PROTECTS ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA AND PUBLIC HEALTH. ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE TRYING. TO AND THIS PANDEMIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR PAN LET ME- YOU KNOW WHEN WE REFERENCE THESE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND I ACTUALLY% LOOKED AT THEM AND IT APPEARS THAT THE BOARD HAS ISSUED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES IN THE FORM OF. REGULATIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SET OUT IN OUR CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS AND IT IT APPEARS THAT YOU'VE ALSO PUBLISHED A MANUAL FOR MODEL DISCIPLINARY ORDERS AND DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. IN REVIEWING THIS MANUAL I KNOW TO DO A FEW STATEMENTS THAT I THOUGHT WERE SIGNIFICANT ONE IS- IN THE PREAMBLE THESE GUIDELINES SET FORTH THE DISCIPLINE THE BOARD FINDS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FOR THE- IDENTIFIED VIOLATIONS AND THERE ARE VIOLATIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIED. IN THE MANUAL GENERAL CLASSIFICATIONS AND THEN THERE'S A FURTHER STATEMENT IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND WE'RE NOT IN AND WE'RE NOT INCONSISTENT. REHABILITATING THE LICENSEE. THE BOARD FINDS THAT IMPOSITION OF THE DISCIPLINE SET FORTH IN THE GUIDELINES WILL PROMOTE UNIFORMITY CERTAINTY. AND FAIRNESS AND DETERRENCE AND IN TURN FURTHER PUBLIC. A PROTECTION WITH RESPECT TO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DEVIATIONS FROM THE GUIDELINES AT LEAST IN TERMS OF QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE MANUAL PROVIDES. ANY PROPOSED DECISION OR SETTLEMENT THAT DEPARTS FROM THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES SHALL IDENTIFY THE DEPARTURES AND THE FACTS SUPPORTING THE DEPARTURE SO MY QUESTION TO YOU. IS THIS IN WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES WERE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT WHICH USED. WHERE THE GUIDELINES FOLLOWED. ANYONE US SENATOR THIS IS A QUESTION THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IN SOME DETAIL FROM TIME TO TIME. THE SETTLEMENTS ALL DEPEND ON THE FACTS THAT INDIVIDUAL CASES AS WE INDICATED THE GUIDELINES ARE BASED ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ALL PARTS OF THE CASE HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO A CLEAR AND CONVINCING STANDARD. AND THEY SIMPLY DO NOT- THEY CANNOT APPLY IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALL CASES THE SETTLEMENTS ARE THE GUIDELINES ALSO GENERALLY HAVE A RANGE OF SANCTIONS. SO WE DON'T KEEP RECORDS IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE DEVIATION FROM THE GUIDELINES IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERY FASCICULATA CASE WHAT I WANTED TO DO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO REBUILD SORT OF A DATABASE AND IT WOULD BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO DO. WELL I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE IN THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION SO ONE OF THESE YOU CAN ADD THIS TO MY LIST OF QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION THAT I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO PROVIDE O THE COMMITTEES THROUGH THE- RESPECTIVE CHIEF CONSULTANTS AND THAT IS LOOKING BACK OVER THELAST. YEAR WHETHER IT'S CALENDAR OR FISCAL HOWEVER YOU CAN. PAGLIA RECORDS I'D LIKE TO. HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CASES- THOSE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT CASES. WORE THE GUIDELINES FOLLOWED. LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. HELLO IN THOSE CASES WHERE THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT DEVIATED FROM THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES THAT ARE PUBLISHED IN THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TO DO YOUR WRITTEN RECORDS TO THE BOARDS WRITTEN RECORDS IDENTIFY THE GUIDELINE DEPARTURE AND THE FACTS AND THE RATIONALE SUPPORTING THE DEPARTURE AS REQUIRED BY THE REGULATIONS. SENATOR ROB THE FINANCER THAT. BUT THE PROPOSED DECISIONS TO CONTAIN THE RATIONALE OR THEY SHOULD FOR A DEVIATION FROM THE GUIDELINES THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE BOARD MEMBERS LOOK FOR WHEN THEY'RE REVIEWING A PROPOSED DECISION AND DETERMINING WHETHER THE- DISCIPLINE IMPOSED IS APPROPRIATE. FOR PROPOSED STIPULATIONS THE REASONS FOR DEVIATIONS FROM THE GUIDELINES ARE CONTAINED IN THE MEMO FROM THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH I ASSUME IS PRIVILEGE YES IT IS SANTA CLAUS WILL BECAUSE- LET'S FOCUS ON ON PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTATION AND I REALLY I WAS FOCUSED ON OF STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE APPROVED WHAT WOULD BE THE RECORD. THAT IDENTIFIES THE DEPARTURE AND THE FACTS AND RATIONALE SUPPORTING THE DEPARTURE WOULD THAT BE AN ACTUAL BOARD DECISION. THE STIPULATION ITSELF THAT IS PUBLISHED DOES NOT CONTAIN A DISCUSSION ON THE REASONS WHY THE STIPULATION WAS- AGREE TO IT AND BY. DEVIATION FROM THE GUIDELINES WHERE APPROPRIATE. REASONS ARE ARE CONFIDENTIAL PART OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS AND IT IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TO BE CONTAINED IN A PUBLIC DOCUMENT. WELL THAT'S SORT OF CONTRARY TO THE TO THE MANUAL THAT THE BOARD IS PUBLISHED. WHAT THE COURT DOES GET THE REASONS FOR DEVIATION AND THAT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES IN THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL MEMO. THAT MUST BE INCLUDED IN THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR THE RECORDS REQUEST OR ISSUED A SUBPOENA. WHAT DOCUMENT ON PRIVILEGED DOCUMENT WOULD I BE REQUESTING. HAVING REDACTED PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF COURSE WHAT DOCUMENT WOULD I REQUEST THAT WOULD GIVE ME THE REASONS WHY THE GUIDELINES WERE DEVIATED FROM IT IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE. REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE SAID PREAMBLE TO THE GUIDELINES- HILLS REASONS WHY PROMOTE ORCHARD MY QUESTION IN A PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH COMPLAINANTS PRODUCT PART OF THE ISSUES ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO BE BROUGHT TO THE- TO THIS BODY THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE AND HE'S COMMITTEES. IS IT PEOPLE. CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE WHY. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE. NEED TO LEAD TO IDENTIFYING PARTICULAR PHYSICIANS WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED TO BE BEFORE YOUR BOARD. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE WHY SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT DOCUMENT WOULD I REQUEST IN THE POSITION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT WOULD TELL ME IN ANY GIVEN DISCIPLINARY CASE WERE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT WE USED. WHAT THE RED AND DEEP THE GUIDELINES WERE DEVIATED FROM WHAT THE REASONS FOR THE DEVIATION WERE. DOES ONE EXIST WELL SAN RAPHAEL THERE THERE WOULD BE ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL MEMO ITSELF BUT I CAN'T ACCESS THE MONTH SOMEBODY RAISE THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. SO ABSENT A WAIVER OF THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHAT DOCUMENTS. WOULD LET'S SAY THE LEGISLATURE BE ABLE TO LOOK AT TO DETERMINE IN CASES WERE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT AS A DISCIPLINARY. PROCESS WAS UTILIZED AND WE'RE GUIDELINES WERE DEVIATED FROM THE REASONS FOR THE DEVIATION. IS THAT INFORMATION CORRECT. YEAH CREATING A LOT THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES PLEASE I'M LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER. THANK YOU I MEAN THE ANSWER IS THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RIGHT AND I MEDIAN HELPFUL FOR ME TO EXPLAIN OR WHY THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY ELLISON I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE CONFIDENTIALITY. AND PHYSICIANS AND ALL OF THAT MY CONCERN IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE AND WHAT I'M GOING TO BE QUESTIONING THE FOLKS ABOUT NEXT IS THE EFFICACY OF THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND WHETHER DISCIPLINARY POSED. THAT IS EFFECTIVE AND- WE DIDN'T PUBLISH DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES THE MEDICAL BOARD PUBLISHED DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND DID MORE THAN THAT PUT THEM IN THE CALIFORNIA CODE. OF REGULATIONS AND A MANUAL THAT YOU PUBLISH SO RIGHT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AT CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE IMPOSITION OF DISCIPLINE AND THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES IN EVALUATE DEVIATIONS FROM THE GUIDELINES. AND IN SOME CASES WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. THE Y. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I MEAN WE PRESUME REGULARITY HERE BELIEVE IT OR NOT. DESPITE THE TENOR OF SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT. AND ALSO LET ME JUST LET ME JUST MOVE ON CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE RANGE OF MAYBE THIS IS BEEN ANSWERED. THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE- IS IN A PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT. A CASE MEAN PUBLIC REPRIMAND IS SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN IT GOES TO WHAT. WELL I MEAN IF YOU JUST START WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SANCTION THAT IS REVOCATION. AND THEN IF YOU GO DOWN AND IF YOU'RE REVOKED YOU REVOKE YOU CANNOT PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID YOU HAVE SUSPENSION WHERE YOU CAN PRACTICE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN YOU HAVE PROBATION WITH CONDITIONS AND THE CONDITIONS CAN BE ANYTHING FROM A RANGE OF PROHIBITION TO CERTAIN KINDS OF PRACTICE- TO- NEEDS OR OF A CHEMICAL. MONITORING FOR A PRACTICE MONITOR FOR SUPERVISION THEY'RE CONDITIONS MAY BE LESS ONEROUS SUCH AS THE TAKING OF A- OF A COURSE FOR A MEANS OF STUDY. THEN YOU GO TO A PUBLIC REPRIMAND. WHICH IS A SIMPLY A PUBLIC RECORD REPRIMAND AND THERE MAY BE CONDITIONS ATTACHED THERE IN TERMS OF TRAINING OR COURSES. AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED A WARNING LETTER AND NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS BUT IT'S NOT BINDING AND IT'S FOR ADVISORS. SO THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTER IS A SPECTRUM. WITHIN THEIR AND IT GOES FOR MORNING LETTERS AT THE AT THE LOWEST ONE UP TO REPLICATION AND WITH RESPECT TO PROBATION WITH OR WITHOUT CONDITIONS IF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THIS MAY HAVE BEEN REFERENCE PREVIOUSLY TO IN WHICH CASE I APOLOGIZE IF AN INDIVIDUAL VIOLATES THE PROBATION WITH OR WITHOUT CONDITIONS WHAT'S THE SANCTION. DO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE AND GO THROUGH THE COMPLAINT PROCESS AGAIN OR IS THERE SOMETHING. THAT AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS WELL I MEAN IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VIOLATE PROBATION AND PROBATION WAS DONE IN SUBSTITUTION FOR REPLICATION YOU CAN RESULT IN REVOCATION RIGHT BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A DISCIPLINE THAT'S A SUSPENDED REVOCATION WITH THE PROBATION CORRECT. CORRECT WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S NO SUSPENDED SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION AND THE DISCIPLINE IMPOSED. IS SIMPLY PROBATION WITH OR WITHOUT CONDITIONS WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A VIOLATION OF PROBATION- IF I MAY. THAT IS WHERE. THE DEBATE. THE TYPE OF DEPARTURE FROM THE PROBATION TERM WOULD BE IDENTIFIED. AND IT MAY BE A- A CITATION- IT MAY BE A- CEASE. ORDER A SEIZE PRACTICE ORDER- OR IT COULD GO FORWARD FOR A PETITION TO REVOKE. SEES PRACTICE ORDERS THAT A TEMPORARY ORDER THAT DEPENDS ON SOME FOLLOW UP DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING- THE CITY'S PRACTICE ORDER IS IT IS A TEMPORARY- TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE PRACTICE SOMEONE HAS A LET'S SAY THEY TAKE A- BODILY FLUID TEST- AND IT COMES PART COMES BACK POSITIVE- THERE CERTAIN TERMS THAT ARE REQUIRED. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SEES PRACTICE ORDER LIFTED- BUT AGAIN ALL THE TURNS ON WHAT THE- NONCOMPLIANCE ISSUE WAS WITH SOUNDS IKE WITH THE SEIZE PRACTICE ORDER THAT'S A TEMPORARY ORDER PENDING. PENDING THE INITIATION OF A FURTHER DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING AGAINST THE- POSITION INVOLVED IS THAT CORRECT- I YES I BELIEVE THAT SERVE AS AN EASY WAY TO DESCRIBE IT OKAY MAY I PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION CENTER OFF YES. SO IT HEY SIS PRACTICE ORDER MAY BE USED IF THERE'S A AN INITIAL POSITIVE RESULTS ON A BIOLOGICAL FLUID TEST BUT THEN THOSE RESULTS- THE BILL LAB COSTS PROVIDE LEGAL BE. DEFENSIBLE RESULTS IN SO IT COULD BE THAT IF IT COMES BACK- NEGATIVE AFTER FURTHER TESTING THE **** PRACTICE ORDER IS LIFTED BUT IT'S INITIALLY IMPOSED RIGHT AWAY WHEN A POSITIVE TEST IS RETURNED. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A SUBSTANCE ABUSE SITUATION OTHER POSITION MISCONDUCT WERE PROBATION ITH OR WITHOUT CONDITIONS IS IMPOSED WITHOUT A SUSPENDED REVOCATION OR SUSPENDED- SUSPENSION. STATUS PENSION. A TURKISH ADAM THE WAY IT'S THE REV STAYED WITH A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME FOR PROBATION THAT ALWAYS THE CASE. THAT'S AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THAT IS ALWAYS HOW IT'S WORDED OKAY AND SO ANOTHER. WAY CASEY'S PRACTICE ORDER MAY BE ISSUED AS IF THE PERSON- IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A PRACTICE MONITOR AND THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE IN TIME. THEN THIS IS PART THIS ORDER WILL BE PUT IN PLACE UNTIL THEY SECURING APPROPRIATE PRACTICE MONITOR IF THEY'RE REQUIRED TO GO FOR A CLINICAL EVALUATION OR OBTAIN A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION. AND THEY DON'T DO IT WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD OF TIME THE PORT WILL POSE A SEIZE PRACTICE ORDER UNTIL. THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE. WHEN ONCE AGAIN. ONCE HAVE A MONITOR IN THAT CASE THAT YOU'VE JUST REFERENCED IF THE INDIVIDUAL ENGAGES IN A VIOLATION OF THE PROBATION- DID YOU TO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR IN EVERY CASE WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS PLACED ON PROBATION THERE IS A STATE REVOCATION THAT IS TIED TO THE PROBATION. YES SIR. OKAY WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC REPRIMAND YOUR MANUAL TALKS ABOUT IT BEING ISSUED FOR MINOR MINOR VIOLATIONS OR- BUT SIMPLE DEPARTURES IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE OF THE PUBLIC REPRIMAND. YEAH. I CAN ASSIST WITH THAT ALSO- IT SHOULD BE USED FOR MINOR VIOLATIONS THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES DO YOU OF ALLOW FOR USE OF A PUBLIC LETTER OF REPRIMAND EIGHT CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE INVOLVING ONE PATIENT. WITH WITH TWO SIMPLE DEPARTURES RIGHT. IT COULD BE A SITUATION WHERE IT'S AN ACT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE WITH ONE PATIENT SO IT'S AN EVENT THAT. DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE'S A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR DEMONSTRATING THAT THIS PERSON IS BENEFIT FOR PRACTICING NEEDS CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND IN THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES IN FACT WITH RESPECT UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT THAT THAT'S THE ONLY NOTE THAT I. SAW WHERE PUBLIC REPRIMAND IS AUTHORIZED IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH ONE PATIENT CORRECT. I DON'T SEE IT FOR DISHONESTY I DON'T SEE IT. PROCURING LICENSE FOR FRAUD EXCESSIVE USE OF ALCOHOL. EXCESSIVE PRESCRIBING IT'S JUST ON RATED CATEGORY GENERAL UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT GROSS NEGLIGENT REPEATED NEGLIGENT ACTS INCOMPETENCE AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN RECORDS CORRECT WELL. THAT THAT IS TRUE WITH REGARD THE RANGES WHERE YOU ASSUME THAT ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE PRUDENT NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE AREA OF. DISCRETION AND WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION AND REHABILITATION WHEN IT'S NOT INCONSISTENT WITH PROVIDING PUBLIC PROTECTION. WELL WE JUST CAN'T LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IN THE CASE OF STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS. THOSE ARE CASES WERE AGREED TO WHERE THE PHYSICIAN ADMITS TO THE ALLEGATION OF THE ACCUSATION AND AGREES TO THE PENALTY IN THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT CORRECT. THAT IS SAID NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND USUALLY WHAT THEY'RE ADMITTING TO IS THAT IF THE MATTER WERE TO GO TO HEARING THE BOARD MAY BE ABLE TO PROVE THE ALLEGATONS- BY THE CLEAR CONVINCING EVIDENCE MAY BE ABLE TO. NOT THAT THERE A GREEN THAT WOULD HAPPEN THEY'RE NOT AGREEING THAT THEY- COMMITTED THE VIOLATIONS. AND THERE'S STILL A LOT. UP IN THE AIR AND SOMETIMES WHAT'S AT ISSUE IS THAT- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THE BOARD MADE ONLY BE ABLE TO PROVE ONE SIMPLE NEGLIGENT ACTS. AND IF THE CASE WERE TO GO TO HEARING AND THAT WAS THE FINDING THEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WOULD PROPOSE A DISMISSAL AND THERE WOULDN'T BE GROUNDS TO OVERTURN THAT DISMISSAL. SO THE BOARD. IS WEIGHING. IN MANY CASES. WEBER EIGHTY SIX SETTLEMENT IS. SUPPORTIVE OF PUBLIC PROTECTION BECAUSE THE RISK OF GOING TO HEARING MAYBE A DISMISSAL IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE NO REPORT TO THE PUBLIC ON THE PHYSICIAN'S PROFILE OR RISK THAT THE DISCIPLINE COULD BE LESS THAN WHAT WAS ULTIMATELY NEGOTIATED. WELL THAT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF US IN IN THAT THE- THE FOCUS TENDS TO BE TO. DISPOSE OF THE MATTER WITH THE LEAST RISK TO. SOMEONE THE BOARD. THE RISK OF LOSS IN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING. OR THE OTHER REASON SHE CHU THE DEAD OF FIDE AND IN SOME CASES PERHAPS- GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THREE THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING THAT- PURSUIT THE MOVE FORWARD A FORMAL DISCIPLINE AND THE NUMBER OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE ACTUALLY TAKEN TO TRIAL THAT PERHAPS THAT NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED LET ME ASK A QUESTION IN THOSE CASES STIPULATED SETTLEMENT CASES IN THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY AND I THINK SOMEONE INDICATED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CASES. INVOLVE PUBLIC REPRIMAND AS A PENALTY DO YOU KNOW. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT SENATOR. SO THE STATS. LAST YEAR THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT YOUR OUTLOOK OR PREVENT OKAY. THERE WERE A FEW SAY THEY WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT. YES SIR AND THAT'S WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES. WILL ALL CONTINUE YOU KNOW- WHAT OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE ADDRESSED US IN LETTERS TO THESE COMMITTEES IS THAT THE BOARD DOESN'T FOLLOW ITS OWN DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT EACH CASE HAS FACTS OF ITS OWN AND THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT THE BOARD IN THE PANELS HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING DETERMINING THE PENALTY TO BE IMPOSED INCLUDING EVIDENTIARY ISSUE SHOULD THE MATTER PROCEED FORWARD TO. TRIAL OR HEARING IN A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS SIMPLY IT'S COMPLEX I WAS ABLE TO REVIEWS SORT OF AN INFORMAL SUMMARY- OF ABOUT A HUNDRED CASES OF- THE BOARDS WHERE I UNDERSTAND THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT WAS ARRIVED AT- IN THE CASES THAT WERE RESOLVED IN THIS FASHION BETWEEN JANUARY ONE AND- DECEMBER THIRTY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AND BY MY COUNT. PUBLIC REPRIMAND FOR MINOR VIOLATIONS WAS IMPOSED IN ABOUT. 40% OF THOSE CASES DOES THAT. I KNOW YOU I DON'T WANT TO FORCE YOU TO DO MATH IN PUBLIC BECAUSE I CAN'T. BUT IS THAT FIGURES SOUND ABOUT RIGHT. ONE BASED ON THE NUMBERS I'M LOOKING OUT FOR NINETEEN TWENTY I WOULD SAY WOULD BE CLOSER 225% OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. OKAY HELLO I WANT TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF THE CASES THAT- AT LEAST BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE WHICH I ADMIT IS NOT YOUR INFORMATION SO WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AT THE END OF THIS HOW WE GET MORE OF YOUR INFORMATION UNLESS OF THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE BUT BEFORE I PROCEED I WANT TO SAY THIS I AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IS COMPLEX AND IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. OF SITUATION I DO APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THE BOARD MEMBERS- DO EVERY DAY TO ATTEMPT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF REGULATION AND LICENSURE AND FRANKLY THE- IT'S SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING PHYSICIANS- PUT FORTH AND PERFORM AROUND THE STATE EVERY DAY PARTICULARLY AND IN THIS PANDEMIC BUT LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT A FEW CASES AND THEN I'LL- WRAP THIS THING UP. CASE NUMBER ONE FOR EXAMPLE PHYSICIAN ADMITS TO USING THE IDENTITY OF TRANSIENT PATIENTS TO SECURE DRUGS AND SELF PRESCRIBED. RESULTING IN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. NOW ASSUMING THOSE OF THE FAX. YOU HAVE THE RECORDS LOOKING AT THE GUIDELINES IN CATEGORIES OF VARIOUS OFFENSES I ASSUME THIS COULD BE DISHONESTY ARISING FROM PATIENT CARE. COULD BE A CONVICTION OF A CRIME COULD BE A VIOLATION OF DRUG STATUTES OR FRANKLY GENERAL UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT ANY OF WHICH IS I READ THE GUIDELINES CARRY A MINIMUM PENALTY. IN THE CASE OF DISHONESTY AND CONVICTION OF A CRIME- STATE REVOCATION A ONE YEAR SUSPENSION AND AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS PROBATION AND IN THE CASE OF SOME OF THESE OTHER OFFENSES THAT I'VE LISTED A STATE REVOCATION AND A PROBATION PERIOD OF. FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS- THE RECORDS I RECEIVE REFLECT ONLY A SEVEN YEAR PROBATION WAS IMPOSED. NOW I BELIEVE I UNDERSTOOD PREVIOUS TESTIMONY TO INDICATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT SEVEN YEAR PROBATION THERE WAS A STATE REVOCATION. SARAH THAT IS THE TYPICAL. WAY THAT. ORDERS FOR PROBATION ARE WORDED STATE REVOCATION WITH A PERIOD OF PROBATION FOLLOWING IS THE EVER DEVIATED FROM IN THE CASE OF PROBATION AND STATE REVOCATION SPECIFICALLY. I'VE ASKED BEFORE LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I WANT TO ASK AGAIN OR OTHER CASES WHERE PROBATION IS IMPOSED AS A PENALTY WITHOUT. ANY STATE REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION. I CANNOT THINK OF AN EXAMPLE WHERE THAT WORDING WAS NOT USED BUT I CAN'T SAY IT BUT IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. THERE'S ANOTHER CASE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED OF THE CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. FAILED TO REPORT THAT CONVICTION IS REQUIRED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. NOW I LOOK AT THE GUIDELINES AND THAT SEEMS TO SPECIFY A FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR PROBATIONARY PERIOD IN SOME CASES STATE REVOCATION. BUT THE RECORDS I REVIEWED REFLECT THAT THE POSITION POSITION RECEIVED A PUBLIC REPRIMAND. NOW I REALIZE YOU HAVE YOUR RECORDS AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MATERIAL THAT I RECEIVED BUT GIVEN THE FACT SITUATION THAT I PRESENTED WHICH YOU CONSIDER THAT TO BE A MINOR OFFENSE OR A- SIMPLE DEPARTURE. ANYONE. SERAPHIM AT IT'S DIFFICULT TO RESPOND TO THESE SCENARIOS JUST BASED ON THAT INFORMATION- THE BOARD. WOULD NOT CONSIDER THAT TO BE A MINOR OFFENSE THE ISSUE IS WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE SURROUNDING IT THAT THE BOARD HAD ACCESS TO WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION- AND REHABILITATION OF THE LAST C. M. WHETHER THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE CONTINUOUS MONITORING IS REQUIRED. THE BOARD DOESN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO PUNISH PHYSICIANS AND- IF THE BOARD GOES BEYOND WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION THEN THE BOARD ANTICIPATES THE PHYSICIAN WOULD SEEK JUDICIAL REVIEW. AND THAT THE MATTER WOULD COME BACK TO THE BOARD TO REVIEW THE PENALTY AGAIN- AND SO. THAT'S KIND OF SURROUNDING INFORMATION BUT I AM NOT COMFORTABLE SPEAKING TO- A PARTICULAR CASE BASED ON A LINE OF INFORMATION. WHERE THAT OTHER ONE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED. AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALLIED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD ABOUT THE CONVICTION. PENALTY IMPOSED PUBLIC REPRIMAND. YEAH I REALIZE YOU CAN'T COMMENT ON SOME OF THESE AND I MAY NOT HAVE THE FACTS EXACTLY RIGHT BUT I GUESS THE POINT IS THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE USE OF THE VERY LEAST PENALTY IN SOME OF THESE CASES WHICH WERE THE WERE THE OFFENSES BUT SEEM TO GO TO THE VERY NATURE OF THE PHYSICIAN'S OBLIGATION INTEGRITY HONESTY. RIGHT AMONG OTHER THINGS HERE'S HERE'S ANOTHER ELECTED. OKAY I RESPONSIBILITY OF SENATOR. BECAUSE I THINK THIS BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT- ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WHERE- THE LEGISLATURE. NOW SPELLS THE BOARD THAT THE BOARD CAN'T DENY A LICENSE OF A PHYSICIAN- IS NOT FORTHCOMING ON INFORMATION THAT- WOULDN'T BY ITSELF BE GROUNDS FOR DENIAL- THE BOARD NO LONGER. ASKS FOR DISCLOSURE OF CONVICTIONS- FOLLOWING THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION- THE LEGISLATURE EXPECTS THE BOARD TO CONSIDER EVIDENCE OF REHABILITATION. AND UNDER TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT- IF THE PHYSICIAN HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN ABLE TO YOU KNOW HAVE A CONVICTION EXPUNGED. THE BOARD IS NOT TO USE THAT AS GROUNDS FOR DENIAL WELL DID SO DURING DURING THE FACT THAT TE DISCIPLINE AND THE PENALTIES THAT YOU HAVE DESIGNED AND BUILT INTO YOUR GUIDELINES IN YOUR MANAGE MANUAL OR A SLIDING SCALE AND YOU HAVE THERE'S A LONG WAY. THERE'S A LONG ROAD TO WALK OR DRIVE BEFORE BETWEEN A PUBLIC REPRIMAND FOR MINOR OFFENSES AND REVOCATION AT THE TAIL END SO I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT. THIS IS A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD AND IT'S EITHER X. OR Y. AND THERE'S NO ROOM IN BETWEEN. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BACK TO CURRENTLY CAUSING SIGNIFICANT INJURIES TO THE VICTIM. THE GUIDELINES WOULD TYPICALLY CALL FOR A MINIMUM PENALTY BY THE WAY OF STATE REVOCATION OF FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR PROBATION AND- AGAIN THE INFORMATION THAT I WAS PROVIDED INDICATES A FIVE YEAR PROBATION WAS THE PENALTY. NO REFERENCE TO A STATE REVOCATION BUT IF YOU FOLLOW WHAT YOU'VE INDICATED BEFORE PERHAPS THAT WAS PART OF THE PROCESS. HERE'S AN OTHERS GO THROUGH THESE QUICKLY I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT BECAUSE- PHYSICIANS PRACTICE RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF TWO PATIENTS WITH THE RECORDS REFLECTING AN EARLIER DEATH OF% THE THIRD PATIENT. AND ADMITTED MULTIPLE EXTREME DEPARTURES. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THERE WAS SEVEN YEAR PROBATION NO REFERENCE OF A STATE REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION AT LEAST IN THE RECORDS. OF THAT I HAVE ANOTHER ONE UNDER WRAPS AND ARE YOU ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A DECISION FROM THE BOARD OR A SUMMARY THAT SOMEONE NOT BOARD STAFF PRESENTED TO YOU WELL I'M LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY THAT WAS PREPARED I DON'T HAVE BOARD DECISIONS AND OF COURSE. THAT'S OUR PROBLEM AND I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. PHYSICIAN CONVICTED OF BATTERY UPON HIS OR HER PARTNER. OKAY CONVICTED- POSITION RECEIVED A PUBLIC REPRIMAND. PUBLIC REPRIMAND- HERE'S ANOTHER ONE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED OF AN ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. DR HAD A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY. PROBATION WAS IMPOSED. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GUIDELINES WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST AS A MINIMUM PENALTY SOMETHING MORE SEVERE AND ONE FINAL AND I THINK AND THEN- CLOSE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE MORE POSITION APPARENTLY FAILED TO FILE A CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES REPORT OF ABUSE IN A KNOWN ABUSE CASE YOUNG CHILD WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ABUSED FURTHER. AND DIED. ONE OR MORE OF YOUR EXPERTS SOMEONE'S EXPERT CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS AN EXTREME DEPARTURE. AND THE PENALTY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS A PUBLIC REPRIMAND. SO YOU KNOW I'M NOT THIS IS NOT A FRIEND I GOTCHA SITUATION- I MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE FACTS OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THEM. AND THE MORE THESE THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED THE POINT IS THAT THERE APPEAR TO BE. A VARIETY OF CASES WHERE. A LESSER PENALTIES HAVE BEEN IMPOSED. WHERE THE GUIDELINES SUGGEST THAT MORE SERIOUS PENALTIES AT LEAST BE CONSIDERED IF NOT OPPOSED AS A METHOD OF. CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER OF REVOCATION AS A METHOD OF CORRECTIVE ACTION AND REHABILITATION. SO I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE ADDRESS THESE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED ISSUES. CERTAINLY ISSUES PERHAPS OF THE NATURE OF THE PENALTY IMPOSED BUT CERTAINLY TRANSPARENCY AND ARE THERE CHANGES IN THIS PROCESS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HERE TO MAKE THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS MAKE MORE SENSE TO US. AND TRANSPARENT. APPS WITH REPORTS REDACTED AS TO PERSONAL. A DEFINING INFORMATION SO WE CAN EVALUATE HOW THE BOARD IS DISCIPLINING PHYSICIANS THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO- REGULATE LICENSE AND- AND CONTROL IN THE SENSE OF PERFORMANCE QUALITY MISCONDUCT. I THOUGHT. US SENATOR IF I COULD INTERJECT THERE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN- CONFOUNDING JURISDICTIONS IN MANY PLACES I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT. THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT THERE IS A NEED. TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT PROCESS- THE MEDICAL pOUT OF MONEY- WE ARE NOT IN A FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE BASIS- AND WE NEED TO FIND EFFICIENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH CASES. FOR REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS BY ITS VERY NATURE IS CONFIDENTIAL FOR REASONS THAT HAPPEN EXPLAINS. WHAT THEREFORE WE NEED TO CONSIDER. ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU HAVE SUGGESTED IS A MORE TRANSPARENT MANNER. OF SETTING FORTH HOW THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED WHAT GOES INTO THEM. I AND PERHAPS IT MEANS- ISSUING REVISED GUIDELINES ISSUING MORE COMPLEX GUIDELINES ISSUING REPORTS WHERE- CASES ARE ANONYMIZED BUT TO EXPLAIN BETTER THE RANGE OF SANCTIONS AND THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE FACE. IS THAT GIVEN THE MOUNTAIN OF CASES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IS THAT THE SETTLEMENTS REMAIN A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT. BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A MORE TRANSPARENT WAY OF EXPLAINING HOW THESE CASES ARE RESOLVED. WHAT FACTORS GO INTO THEM. AND THE BENEFITS THAT ARE ACHIEVED BY DOING IT THIS WAY FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THESE CASES. ON A DAILY BASIS WE KNOW THAT BY RESOLVING THEM QUICKLY. BY GETTING SOMETIMES VERY STRICT UNDERTAKINGS I UNDERSTAND THE CASES THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED. OUR DONE FOR UPDATE FIT INTO A CERTAIN PATTERN. WE COULD SELECT OTHER CASES WHERE THIS THE STIPULATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY SEVERE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THEY GO INTO A RANGE BECAUSE THE CASES REQUIRE. THAT THEY GOING TO ARRANGE BUT I CERTAINLY TAKE YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY. IN THE VERY COMPLEX FACTORS THAT GO INTO IT AND I THINK THE MEDICAL BOARD NEEDS TO MAKE A STRONGER CASE ON HOW RETAINING THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS. ARE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT PROCESSES BY WHICH THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRIVED AT IN OUR APPROVED. THERE IS BOARD OVERSIGHT OF IT. NOW MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT OR A DIFFERENT FORM OF OVERSIGHT. BUT THAT DOES EXIST IT DOES EXIST NOW AND I'VE SEEN IT WORK- BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO THINK OF MORE TRANSPARENT WAYS OF EXPLAINING WHAT IS. A VERY COMPLICATED. VERY LEGALISTIC PROCESS. THANK YOU AND LISTEN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION- N. N. YOUR ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO SOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BY SOME OF US WHO WERE PROBABLY BEING VERY DIFFICULT AT THE TIME WE ASK THEM. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN ADD TO MY LIST OF QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO. SEE AN RESPONSES THE NUMBER OF. CASES WHERE. CASES OF PROBATION VIOLATION WHERE LICENSES WERE. REVOKED IN THE CASE OF A STATE REVOCATION. OF VERSUS THE NUMBER WERE LICENSES WERE NOT REVOKED IN THE CASE OF A PROBATION VIOLATION. SO AGAIN THANK YOU ALL IF YOU CAN STAY ON THERE MAY BE FURTHER QUESTIONS I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL AT THIS POINT IT'S C. OVERVIEW OF PATIENT IMPACTS. WE ARE. FORTUNATE TO HAVE WITH US BRIDGET GRAHAM ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR SUPERVISING ATTORNEY CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AND TJ WHAT CAN SAY A CURRENT MEDICAL BOARD MEMBER TO PRESENT THANK YOU- BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND LISTENING TO THE REST OF US DRONE ON AND FOR WAITING FOR YOUR TIME 2% SO- IS IT MS GRAHAM. YES THANK YOU IT'S GRAMMY ACTUALLY IT'S WITH WHAT'S KEEPING. RAMIE GRAMMY I APOLOGIZE I HATE TO ME NO PROBLEM PEOPLE'S NAME NO PROBLEM IT HAPPENS US THE GOOD MORNING. ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LAW AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEES FOR INVITING ME TO COMMENT TODAY AND FOR THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT THAT YOUR STAFF HAVE PUT INTO THE VERY IMPRESSIVE BACKGROUND PAPER PREPARED FOR YOU- I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE JUST LISTENING THE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND THOROUGH QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL HAVE REYES THIS MORNING AND- IT REALLY SHOWS THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS VERY IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT ROLE SERIOUSLY. AND I HOPE THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE USEFUL TEAM THROUGHOUT THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS IT IS IF YOU WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH CPA L. WE ARE A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ACADEMIC AND ADVOCACY AND ORGANIZATION. BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY. FOR OVER YEARS CTL HAS STUDIED OCCUPATIONAL LACE. AND MONITOR CAL AGENTS THAT REGULATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND TRADES INCLUDING THE MEDICAL BOARD AND OTHER DCA HEALTHCARE BOARDS. IN TWO THOUSAN THREE MY PREDECESSOR JULIE DEANGELIS DIAMOND WAS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO SERVE AS THE BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT MONITOR. AFTER CONTINUED REPORTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AFTER TWO YEARS OF STUDY SHE MADE SIXTY FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN THE SERIES OF REFORM LEGISLATION. DETAIL CONTINUES TO MONITOR CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR REGULATORY AGENCIES AND PUBLISHES THE CALIFORNIA REGULATORY LAW REPORTER WHICH TRACKS AGENCY ACTIVITY. THE TITLE OF THIS HEARING POSES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. DOES THE MEDICAL BOARD PROTECT THE PUBLIC WORKS POSITIONS. IT IS NOT A QUESTION THAT CAN BE ANSWERED WITH A SIMPLE YES OR NOW. AND SO DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS I URGE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT QUESTION. WHICH IS DOES THE PUBLIC BELIEVE THAT THE BOARD IS PRIORITIZING PUBLIC PROTECTION OVER PROTECTION OF PHYSICIANS. AND AS I EXPECT YOU WILL HEAR DURING TODAY'S PUBLIC COMMENTS N. AS IN THIS LASSEN ALLUDED TO AND HER COMMENTS EARLIER THIS MORNING. THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS NOW. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS MORNING'S DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO BE PRO ACTIVE IN ITS REGULATION TO BE FAIR THE BOARD IS NOT SET UP RIGHT NOW TO BE A PROACTIVE REGULATOR. THE CURRENT JUST DISCIPLINE SYSTEM IS IN FACT A COMPLAINT DRIVEN SYSTEM. AND AS WE RAISED IN OUR LETTER THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER CHANGING DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR PATIENTS TO BE HARMED BEFORE. THE BOARD CAN START TAKING ACTION. FROM A PURELY OF STAN THE PROCESS TIME FROM COME TO READ. RIGHT NOW ARE SIMPLY A- LET'S NOT FOR THAT INFO OF THE TWO. AND CASES THAT DISCUSS THE SMART FROM LOS. AND FROM SENATOR HER TO AND MEMBER FUNDS TO. THOSE ARE CRAP THAT RIGHT NOW. AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE JUST PROCESS. AS ATTORNEYS WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT EXCUSE PHYSICIANS ARE ENTITLED DUE PROCESS AND ANY PRECEDING THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR CONTINUED ABILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RIGHT AND PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM. BUT IN OUR OBSERVATION AS WE HAVE POINTED OUT IN OUR LETTER. THIS RATE CAN BE ABUSED BY PHYSICIANS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS WHO USE AN ARRAY OF STALL TACTICS TO DRAG OUT THE PROCESS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE OFTEN FOR YEARS AT GREAT RISK TO THE PUBLIC. AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE. MUST BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC. ISSUE THE BOY SURVEY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PUB EXPERIENCE THAT THE COMPLAINT. DOESN'T BUT THE VAST MAJORITY MAJORITY OF FIRST. LABELING THEIR- AS OR VERY. WE'VE HER STORIES OF PATIENT. WHOSE CASES WERE CLOSED WITHOUT EVER BEING INTERVIEWED BY ANYONE ON THE BOARD. CLICK AND AS A TURN WE- THAT THE BOARD CAN ONLY PROCEED ON A COMPLAINT IF IT HAD THE STATUTORY BASIS TO DO SO. BUT THE PROCEDURES AS THEY EXIST ARE DEVALUING OFTEN TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES THAT THESE COMPLAINANTS HAVE INDOOR. AND TO CONTINUE AND THEY'RE CONTINUING TO BREAK DOWN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE BOARD. I THINK SEVERAL THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED TODAY THE BOARD REALLY REFLECT THAT. A BRING BEAR OUR FORTY YEARS OF AGE. IN MY- CALIFORNIA REGULATORY BOARDS AND I. OF THE YEARS TO HOLD THESE SPORTS. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC NOT THE PER. I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY ON A FOUR RECOMMEND. THAT ENHANCE THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION REMAINS AS PARAMOUNT PRIORITY. AND IT'S HARD TO TELL MORE FULLY DETAILED IN OUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT WE SUBMITTED. UNDER NUMBER ONE IS THE BOARD'S FEES MUST BE A- I REALLY THIS HEARING BUT IT IS VERY RELEVANT TO THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND THE BOARD HAS MORE THAN JUSTIFIED ITS NEED TO INCREASE ITS FEES. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE BOARD TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND THE FACT THAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WAS JUST TELLING YOU THAT THEY'RE NOT IN A FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE POSITION AND APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED TO SETTLE CASES IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY. IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING. THE SECOND RECOMMEND. WE HAVE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAD TO PUT. MEMBERS TO THE BOARD. CHAU HAS BEEN. FOR A CUP MEMBER. OF THE BOARD FOR. AND OF. SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TWENTY ATKINS RAISE THE SUGGESTION IF YOU WEEK AGO AT THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE HEARING. AFTER A NUMBER OF PATIENTS ADVOCATES RACE SERIES CONCERNS ABOUT THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH STOCKS OBSERVATION THAT ESTABLISHING A PUBLIC MAJORITY ON THE BOARD. WOULD DECREASE THE RISK OF ANTITRUST EXPOSURE AND HAVE VALUE ADDED OF THE MORE PATIENTS. FOR AS I EXPLAIN IN WORDS. AND LETTER IT IS NOW THEN SIX YEAR SINCE THE U. S. COURT ISSUED ITS TO TEN. AND NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF DENTAL. VERSUS THE TRADE THAT FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. THAT LANDMARK CASE HELD THAT BOARDS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY ACTIVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROFESSION REGULATED. SUCH AS THE MEDICAL BOARD WHICH IS CONTROLLED Y DOCTORS. ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED IMMUNITY FROM THE ANTI TRUST LAWS. JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE A STATE AGENCY. AND REGULATORY BOARDS MAKE DECISIONS DECISIONS EVERY DAY SUCH AS HUMANE INTO THE PROFESSION. THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE UNQUESTIONABLY ANTI COMPETITIVE. THE SUPREME COURT LAID OUT A SERIES OF CHECKS THAT MUST BE PRESENT TO SHOW THAT A BOARD IS SUFFICIENTLY AND ACTIVELY SUPERVISED BY THE STATE. IN ORDER TO ENJOY A STATE ACTION IMMUNITY FROM THE ANTI TRUST LAWS. AND THOSE CHECKS ARE NOT PRESENT RIGHT NOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT CHAU SPONSORED A BILL THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE DCA TO EXERCISE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISION. OVER AT CEMEX SEMI AUTONOMOUS BOARDS BUT THAT LEGISLATION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AFTER HEAVY OPPOSITION FROM TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE BOARD WOULD CERTAINLY HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC REMAINS A KEY FOCUS. OF THE BOARD'S ACTIVITY AND WITH LESSEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROFESSION CONTROL THE BOARD. AND I WOULD ADD AS A ADDED IN THE LETTER THERE ARE THREE PUBLIC- AND PUBLIC MEMBER VACANCIES RIGHT NOW WHICH ARE JUST EXACERBATING. THIS PROBLEM. A THIRD. WE RECOMMEND THAT LEDGERS LEGISLATURE SET UP. ANOTHER AND- MONITOR AND A ON ALL THE- TODAY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOARD EXIST ENFORCE SYSTEM AS I'M- OF GREAT CONCERN. IT IS UNDER RESEARCH. IT APPEARS THERE'S BEEN A BREAKDOWN IN THE REAL. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. OF THE TRANSFER OF THE- TO DO. AND TWENTY THIRD CREATE FURTHER. AND THE PUBLIC. IN THE IS A- LOW. WHAT IS LESS CLEAR IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT THE BOARD ABILITY QUICKLY INEFFICIENT I TELL. IN OUR HARM DR FROM PACK AS- AS YOU WILL DURING PUBLIC. A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. RESULTING THIS VERY VERY SERIOUS SITUATION THROUGH THE POLITICAL PROCESS. WHERE THE PARTIES WHOSE INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE OUR LESSEN OBJECTIVES AND HAD AN EQUAL LEVELS OF INPUT. WITH THIS MAKERS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO THIS. SERIOUS REFORM OF THE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE GATHERED AND ANALYZED BY AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER. SUCH AN OBJECTIVE STUDY BENEFITS EVERYONE FOR PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A VIGOROUS TRUSTED REGULATORY PROGRAM IN PLACE. THAT PREVENTS AS MANY PATIENTS AS POSSIBLE FROM BEING DAMAGED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AMONG OTHER ISSUES THE ENFORCEMENT MONITOR CAN CONDUCT A THOROUGH. THOROUGH AND INDEPENDENT STUDY OF THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE BOARD DEVIATES FROM THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY COULD TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE EFFICACY OF THE PROBATION MONITORING PROGRAM. ASSESS WHETHER THE PUBLIC PROTECTION IS AT RISK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES INVOLVING SETTLEMENTS. THE MONITOR COULD ALSO RESEARCH AND RECOMMEND PROACTIVE REGULATORY APPROACHES AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. IN THE DAY IN ADDITION TO THIS EXISTING CLAIM- COMPLAINT BASED MODEL. THAT WOULD PERMIT THE BOARD TO IDENTIFY AND DISCIPLINE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PHYSICIANS BEFORE PATIENTS ARE HARMED. RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THEM TO BE HARMED AND THEN FILE A COMPLAINT. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT MULTIPLE BOARDS INCLUDING THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. AND BASED. ON THE QUESTIONS OF THE MEMBERS THIS MORE IT APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM THAT LED TO. MY BE AND IN X. AND WELL. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU DECIDE TO APPOINT AN SOMEONE THIS CREEK ISSUE MUST BE CONSIDERED DURING THIS REGION AS THE- HERE SO HELP PLAN OUT AND GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW I KNOW WE ARE RUNNING ANTI. BUT ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP VERY MUCH TODAY IS- THE- PROCESS AND I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE CPA I WAS WRECKED. THE BOY AND THAT SHOULD MOVE TO ATTORNEY OFFICE A A- MEANT RECOMMENDED BY THE AND FOR MONITOR. SO THAT ALL THE TEAM PROSECUTORS INVEST CAN WORK TO AS EXTRA AS POSSIBLE TO MEET CAN PROTECTION THERE FOR AND- THIS RECOMMENDED WAS NOT AND FROM AS REC. AND WAS ONLY MADE MARK. BY THE TRANSFER OF THE INVESTIGATORS DCA THE BOARD'S DATA MAKES CLEAR THAT IT WAS THE TRANSFERRED TO DCA AND NOT VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE THE UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. INVESTIGATION TIME. AT A MINIMUM THE LEGISLATURE SICKENS REFERRED. MESSIER'S ARMS BY THE BOARD AND THE GENERAL ASSIGNED A DEPUTY AND JUST OFFICE WORK IN EACH BE SEEN FIELD OFFICE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND TO. WE DO NOT THE SIM IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT THE CAN COME THE POOR TO INVEST AN PROSECUTE IT'S ON ARE THIS TIME. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THIS WOULD EXACERBATE THE PUBLIC TRUST ISSUE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AND HEALTH RESEARCH COULD BE CONDUCTED THAT WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A DEPARTURE. FROM THE TREE GENERAL PROSECUTION. I ALSO WANT A HIGH CREEK THE MANTA A- WORK. AND NUMBER FIFTEEN. IT'S VERY CONCERNING THAT THE BOARD SUSPECT THAT'S NOT RECEIVING MANY OF THESE MANDATORY REPORTS. AND THESE ARE CRITICAL TOOLS THAT WILL LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF DISCIPLINE OF HARMFUL POSITIONS- AND A SENATOR AS SENATOR ROSS MENTIONED AS WELL. IN THE FACT THAT THE ACT THAT ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN SANTA CLARA AND WHICH- THIS IS ESTAMOS PERMIT TO PACKED FOR MANY YEARS. MANY COMPLAINTS AND FINDINGS FROM OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND IT RAISES QUESTIONS AS TO THIS THIS MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND WHETHER WE NEED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MANDATED REPORTS FOR A STATE AGENCIES- I DO WANNA HIGHLIGHT TO THAT WE POINTED OUT IN OUR LETTER THERE IS. A REPORT MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SETTLEMENTS UP TO TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED. AND FOR SOME OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE HAVE THEN AWARE OF WHAT WE ARE SUSPECTING MIGHT BE A WIDE. SPREAD PRACTICE IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE SETTLING CASES FOR THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY THEN STATE. OUT OF POCKET THE DIFFERENCE TO THE PLAINTIFFS AND THIS IS A WAY THAT THEY ARE AVOIDING HAVING TO REPORT THE SETTLEMENTS ESPECIALLY INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVING TO REPORT SETTLEMENTS- AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. THING THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER AND PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST ELIMINATE THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD AND ALL SETTLEMENTS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE BOARD. I'M AND THEN IT NUMBER TWO ON. JUST YOU KNOW. PRETTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PHYSICIAN THAT IS. ADAM IN SENATOR HER TARDIS DISTRICT THAT PERSON WAS PLACED ON HER. FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE EXISTING PATIENTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR PATIENTS THEY'RE ON PROBATION. WOULD NOT APPLY TO THAT DOCTOR. BECAUSE CURRENTLY CHRIS NEGLIGENCE NOT ONE OF THE STATUTORY. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK IT EXPOSES A REAL GAPING HOLE. IN THE SAND AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING THE PATIENTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT AND IN IN IN HAND SINK A TRANSFER. MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION HAS TO DO WITH AN INDEPENDENT ON THE OFFICE. AND THIS IDEA IS COMING FROM LOOKING AT OTHER JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE U. K. AND WENT TO AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE TO BE ESTABLISHED TO HELP COMPLAINTS NAVIGATE SYSTEM- TO DISTILL. THAT TO HELP EXPLAIN WHAT GOING ON THE PROCESS. AND ALSO TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE TRENDS THAT MAY BE CURRENTLY NOT A VIOLATION OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE AND AT A MINIMUM COULD HELP ASSIST THE BOARD. WITH PROACTIVE REGULATION. REALLY APPRECIATE THE- TO SPEAK TO TODAY AND HOW. HAPPY THE IN ANY. AND K. L. AS A BILL TO US THE CAN IN ITS AS THEY WORK THROUGH THE AND EVERY PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS GRAMMY WE PRE. YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR REC. YOU'LL BE US FOR FEW MINUTES ANYWAY- I ASSUME. LET'S MOVE ON- BOARD MEMBER CAN IF YOU'RE ON THE ON THE SCREEN OR ON THE LINE. MISTER WATKINS. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON- ON ROLE ON BOTH CHAIR OFFICE AND- ON A BILL. EVAN LOW. AND TO THE COMMITTEE AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL FULL TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. IN THIS HEARING- FIRST I NEED TO I NEED TO TANK SOMEONE ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE LAST WEEK AROUND THIS TIME. I WAS PULLING MY HAIR OUT IN FRUSTRATION. AND THAT HAS HAPPENED A LOT IN MY TIME ON THE BOARD. AND EVAN LOW WAS ASSEMBLY MAN EVAN LOW WAS TALKING TO THE- EXACTLY OFFICE ALL TO BE ALREADY IN. ANY POINTERS OUT THAT PUBLIC MAY CAN SPEAK IN THIS. AND DID THE DAY BEFORE WAS JUST SO. BIG THEY EACH THAT I HAVE. AND IS BOARD. HAS GONE HER. AND WHEN I SAY ON HOW I'M- THAT PEOPLE ARE NICE. AND THEY WILL SMILE AT YOU BUT THEY WILL DO NOT CREATE. AND THAT IS BEEN TROUBLING AND ALLOW FAITH. THAT IN THIS FOR THIS BOARD FOR. THE EX PROBLEM. AND TELLING THAT EXIST CAN BE IN. FOR AND I WILL ARTICULATE THIS AS I COOK COUNTY. HELLO THANK YOU. FOR THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS ENDED UP BEING THE VICE CHAIR AND ALSO DONE A GOOD TO THE FEDERAL STATE'S BOARD OF PHYSICAL THERAPIST. AND DURING THAT TIME. I'VE HAD EXTENSIVE TRAINING. AS A IN THE ROLE OF THE BOARD MEMBER. ONTO A TWO DECADE OVER I'LL CALL CASES ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. AND 80% STAYS THE SAME WHEN YOU COME TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND DIDN'T IS A BAGEL IDEA ALSO LEGAL STUFF THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN. AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN I CAME ACROSS CASES THAT WAS PROBABLY FROM A PUBLIC PROTECTION POINT OF VIEW. AND I RAISE MY HAND. AND I BROUGHT IT BEFORE SOMEONE LEGAL THERE WAS DROPPED. AND IT WAS YOU ARE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT PUBLIC MEMBERS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND- BOARD COUNCIL SHE WAS ALWAYS NICE TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND. AND THAT. TOLD ME HE GAVE ME THE NEW CASE AND I NEED. TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND REALLY LOOK AT THESE CASES. BECAUSE THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THESE CASES IS THAT. THEY REALLY INVOLVE PEOPLE WINNING BOTH PEOPLE IS A AN IMAGE YOU ATTACHED TO IT. SO THAT'S MY BACKDROP WHY DOES THIS BOARD EVEN EXISTS I'VE HEARD THAT QUESTION SO MANY TIMES WHY DO YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE HEAR YOU ON THE MEDICAL BOOK ONE DATES AS THEY DO NOTHING ALL THEY YOU KNOW THEY JUST TAKE LICENSES I'VE HEARD THAT AS WELL SO THERE'S DIFFERENT. BETTING PERCEPTIONS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE THE BASIS ON WHICH THIS BOARD IS FOUND AND THAT IS BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE IS TWO THOUSAND AND SUBSECTION TWO THOUSAND AND ONE POINT ONE SIX OF THE PRIORITY OF THE BOARD. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC SHALL BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IN EXERCISING ITS LICENSING REGULATORY AND DISCIPLINARY FUNCTIONS. WHENEVER THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS INCONSISTENT WITH OTHER INTO SOLD TO BE PROMOTED. THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC SELBY PARAMOUNT THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC SHALL BE PARAMOUNT. SO NOT TODAY AS PART OF MY CONTINUAL EDUCATION IDEA. THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF POINT TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE STRUGGLE TO NINE. IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION IS ONE THING AND THEN DOES HE HAVE A LOCATION AND THE PRACTICE OF AND PRACTICE RESTRICTIONS. BUSINESS CO TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SAYS IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMPETING INTERESTS THIS SHALL BE PARAMOUNT. BUT DURING THIS PERIOD I WAS I HAD A WHOLE- PRESIDENT. A LOT OF NOTES THAT I WANTED TO PRESENT BUT I DON'T NEED TO ANYMORE. BECAUSE POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND SO WHAT I WANT TO EXPLAIN AND CLARIFY. THAT WOULD BE CAN CARE FOR ME SO I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT. IS THAT IS TWO WORLDS THAT WE ARE SEEING WE'VE SEEN THE WORLD IN WHICH YOU LEARN AS A BOARD MEMBER. AND THE BOARD STAFF AND ALL OF THIS AND BY THE WAY THE BULLETS THAT DOES INCREDIBLE WORK. THEY WORK REALLY HARD. IT'S WE HAS THE BOARD MEMBERS WHEN WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS THAT'S FAILED ALL OF THEM INCLUDING THE PUBLIC. WE UNDERMINE THE STAFF'S WORK. AND WE UNDERMINE THE BOARD EXPENSE BY THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE AND IT'S MOST TROUBLING IS SET ON A BOARD AND HAVE YOUR PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY CHALLENGED EVERY SINGLE TIME. EVERY SINGLE TIME. YOU'VE GOT A STEP OVER WHAT A BIG DEAL VALUES ALL. THIS BILL IS VALUES AND THAT IS BEING DEFINED AS WHAT YOU DO MOST NATURALLY WITHOUT THINKING. THIS BOARDS BATTERIES WE PROTECT THE DOCTORS. AND WE'LL GO- OPEN BAR IN ORDER TO DO SO. MORE ACCURATELY BUSINESS PRESS AND PROFESSIONS CODES DOUBLE TWO NINE GAVE ME INSIGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A LIMITATION IN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AT THE SEAMANS. THE KEY. TO REDUCE SENTENCES IT'S THE KEY TO ANYTHING AND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY APPLY THE GUIDELINES IT IS TO SEE THIS PUNISHMENT. BUT WE HAD A LITTLE. THE ONLY REASON WHY ANY OF THESE CASES THAT IS SO PROBABLY COMES BEFORE THIS BOARD AND ALL DECIDED BY THE BOARD WE AS THE BOARD MEMBERS ME INCLUDED. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DECISIONS. WE DO NOT PUSHED BACK. TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER ENOUGH WHEN WE COME ACROSS AS LEGAL ADVICE YEAH HE'S HOLDING ON IT'S BIASED IT'S MISLEADING IT IS FILLED WITH OMISSIONS AND COMMISSIONS. IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THEIR DOCTORS. IT'S STRUGGLING A LOT OF PAIN THE PUBLIC IS EXPERIENCING. CONTACT IS CONTAINED IN THOSE DOCUMENTS. ANY STRUGGLING ON EVERY LEVEL TO SIT ON THIS BOARD. AND TO TRY I HAVE A CLOSE THE FORWARD LOOKING ATTITUDE I GO THROUGH LIFE AND I AM A PROBLEM SOLVER. WHAT I DO FOR MY DAY JOB IS HIRED LOOK FOR PATTERNS AND THE PATTERNS JUMPED ON ME IN THIS SPORT. WHY DO I SAY THAT THIS BOARD CRITICS STOCKS BECAUSE SOUNDS INFLAMMATORY. BUT I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO QUOTE STATISTICS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN I DIDN'T SHUT DOWN SO MANY TIMES. BY THE TIME THE GOOD WAY. THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS THAT ARE DECIDED FOR THE WHOLE OF LAST YEAR. EVERY CASE EVERY STIPULATE THE CIRCLING THAT COMES ACROSS MY DESK. I'M GOING TO TRACK WITH THAT WE FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES. WHAT EASE THE PROBATION PERIOD AND WE GONNA. IMPOSE ON. WHAT ASKING TROUBLING IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND EVERYTHING. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING BEING TROUBLING. I HAD IT'S A IT'S JUST INTERESTING LET'S CHANGE THE WEATHER. THE BOARD USES. I LEGAL BAIL. IN OKAY TO PROTECT OFFICE AND WE KNOW NOW THAT THE REHABILITATION IS ON TALK AND IN PUBLIC INTEREST SOMEONE AS FOLLOWS AT THE LOWER LEVELS. AND WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT FROM THE STATISTICS. AND MAKE ME BRING YOU SOME OF THE STATISTICS EVERY CASE ID. ME PERSONALLY AB THE SEASON ON LAW CENTER AND ONCE THE OUTCOME OF THAT THIS SEASON I ASKED HER. IT'S MY PERSONAL INFORMATION I'M NOT SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH ANYBODY BUT IT'S INTERESTING ALL CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE TOPLINE NUMBERS WITHIN THE SPORT. I DON'T GO TO THEM QUICKLY. BUT BEFORE I DO THAT SOMETHING POPPED OUT AT ME A QUESTION WAS AKED ABOUT. THE BOARD MEMBER COMPOSITION. AND NOBODY FROM THE BOARD NO ONE ANSWERED IT. WE WAS SAYING THEY WERE SEVEN AUTHORIZED MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WE WAS SAYING GET OUT OF THE EAST THERE WAS SIX MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SO LET ME JUST HEAR THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL THING BUT IT'S A SYMPTOM OF A BIGGER PROBLEM. AND A PROBLEM THAT IS CONSISTENT. IT'S A LITTLE MISSION. RIGHT LET ME GIVE YOU THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING I WENT TO GO LOOK FOR THOSE NUMBERS. TWENTY THE THING. IT WAS SIX DOCTOR MEMBERS ON THIS BOARD WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND THEY WERE FULL PUBLIC MEMBERS A DOCTOR MAJORITY BOARD. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO THE FOLLOWING YEAR OFF THAT THAT MAKES SENSE OF THE REVIEW THERE WAS A DOCTOR'S AND SIX MEMBERS. AND NOW THIS YEAR AT SUNSET REVIEW. THEY ALL EIGHT MEMBERS TALK TO MEMBERS AND THEY WERE FULL MEMBERS UP TO THE LAST BOARD MEETING THEY JUST APPOINTED ANOTHER ONE. IS AN INTERESTING IMPLICATION WITH THAT. BOTH PANELS ASIK UP IN A WAY THAT IS A MAJORITY OF DOCTOR MEMBERS. AND SO IF A DECISION THAT CAME FROM THE DAG. AND ALEXANDER THE OFFICE. HOLES OUT OF THAT. GUIDELINES WELL WE ARE UNHAPPY ASK PUBLIC MEMBERS WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO OVERRIDE THAT AND WE HAVE IN THE PAST WE HAVE DONE THAT SUCCESSFULLY FUNDED SAY IT CANNOT BE DONE. AND I WILL SPEAK TO THIS POINT A LITTLE LATER AGAIN. BUT FIRST I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO. THE STATISTICS WHAT I FIND. AND I'M I'M SO CONFIDENT THAT WHEN YOU EXTRAPOLATE THESE NUMBERS. THAT YOU WILL GET WITHIN. FIVE OR 7% OF WHAT I'M GOING TO QUOTE HERE TODAY. AND SOME OF THESE KIND OF FIXING FONG. BUT AND I'M I'M AND I'M SETTING THE STAGE FOR. BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT. THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER USING THIS THERE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER SAYS THAT WE SET GOALS SET A SEVENTY NINE POINT 5% OF ALL CASES BUT LAST WEEK LAST YEAR WE DID 84% AND YEAH. IT'S NORMAL EVERYBODY DOES IT IS WHAT I KEEP HEARING EVERYBODY DOES IT ALL THIS IS ALMOST STANDARD WITHIN THE- WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY. YES IT IS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY BE TO. BUT IT'S HOW WE DO IT. I MEAN THE HOME WE FIND EVERYTHING. IF WE WERE SAID DURING THOSE CASES FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE. IF WE WERE SETTLING THESE CASES WHAT APPROPRIATE. REHABILITATIVE REAL REHABILITATE THIS INITIATIVES IN PLACE I WOULD NOT BE SITTING BOTTOM SITTING ON BECAUSE NONE OF THAT IS FALL IS AS HAPPY AS THIS ANYTHING. FROM MY EXPERIENCE MY BOARD MEMBERS MAY DISAGREE. SO LET ME QUOTE YOU THIS. AND THE THIS IS ALSO A KEEN. THE CALLOUSNESS THE YOU KNOW LIKE INDIFFERENCE WITH WHICH THIS NUMBERS ARE REPRESENTED. IS EVEN SO MUCH MORE TROUBLING BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A SKETCH OF THE BACKGROUND OF THIS. WHEN YOU ENTER INTO A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT. I DOCTOR WALKS AWAY WITHOUT HAVING TO INCUR ANY MORE ISSUES. REGARDLESS OF HOW GOOD HE JUST YOUR FINGERS. HI. UNDER THE TERMS OR THE PUBLIC THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF THAT DOCTOR. THEY'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY GET A LETTER. AND THEY ARE LATEST. HAVING DID YOU CLOSE IS CUT SHORT BECAUSE NOW WE WANT TO SAVE MONEY NOW WE WANT TO GO EFFICIENT OVER BEING EFFECTIVE. AND THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IT IS IT BECAUSE OF BENEFITS RIGHT. BUT LET ME BRING YOU INTO THE INTO THE REAL FEELINGS THINGS THE STOP AND WE KIND OF AVOID. BUT IT CAME. HOME TO ROOST AT THE LAST BOARD MEETING. WHEN FOLKS CALLING FROM DISPLACED. I'M ONLY THURMOND PASS. IN THE HALLS FROM THE HOLIDAY BREAK. CHOLERIC OF NOT HAVING IT ANSYS. THE CRY OF A MOTHER WHO LOST THE DAUGHTER. A COMMA FOLLOWED WHICH WAS FEELING POWERLESS. POPULOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T PROTECTIONS AND- WE CREATED. NO ONE ELSE. I'LL BLOOD PANELS THAT MAKES THESE DECISIONS. WE CAN EASILY PUSH BACK WE CAN REVIEW CASES IF WE WANTED THAT SO IT WILL BE SO. BECAUSE EVENTUALLY ALL THE CASES COME BACK TO US. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TO US THEY COME BACK WITH COMMENTS SO WE COULD GET BETTER WE COULD BUILD THE SYSTEM BETTER. IF WE WANTED TO. BUT THERE'S NO WILL. THERE'S NO CREATIVITY THAT I HAVE WITNESSED BUT WHAT THE EAST. IS CONCEALING. A CLOSED SYSTEM. SHUTTING EVERYBODY DOWN THAT'S WHAT HE IS SO BUT IT'S CONTINUOUS AUTO BETS. SEVENTY NINE POINTS PLAQUE WAS IN CALL OF THE CASES THAT EVERYONE DOES IT. LET ME GIVE YOU MY STATISTICS. HELLO TO ALL MY CASES THAT I DID LAST YEAR. IN THIS MAY INTEREST HIM AND DRAW. THAT FOR THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS THAT WE DEVIATED OPINION WEEK MITIGATING FACTORS. MISREPRESENTING FACTS AND- THIS ONLY ONLY SINCE AND CALL ME SINCE I'M GOING TO INDICATING. THIS COULD NOT BE INFLAMMATORY. BUT THE SENIOR SPENDING BENEFITS DOCTORS. END MANY TIMES WHEN I SEE THIS I I'M I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT HAPPENS AND BACCHANAL. SO WHEN I PUSHED BACK ON TO THIS CASES INCOME CA BOARD LEADERSHIP IT BECOMES VERY APPARENT THAT THEY WILL LISTEN TO ME. BUT YOU ME. BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY REALLY GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. BECAUSE WE HAVE A FULL TO MAJORITY ON YOUR BOARD. AND UNLESS I COME IN A PREPAID THREE DAYS TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE I'VE LEARNED MORE SKILLS ABOUT PRESENTING CASES THAN I EVER TOLD I WOULD SIGN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. BUT ANOTHER IS ANOTHER INTERESTING TO STATISTICS HOW MY INFORMATION. THAT I THINK WILL BE IN THE REINS WITH THE BOARD'S INFORMATION IF WE WERE TO CHANGE FORMATION IF WE ASKED FOR RECALLS. DR A LOT- JIM IN THE WORLD ASK FOR HOW MANY TIMES DID WE ISSUE LETTERS OF PUBLIC CREEK FROM. AND I HAVE IT AT 40% OF THE CASE OF CASE. I DON'T 30% 240% THAT'S WE ALL. SO WE SET THE LITTERED MORE ALL OF OUR CASES BY PUBLICLY FROM. AND I. LEARN SOMETHING TODAY THAT IT INCLUDES ONE PATIENT AND TWO. SIMPLE THE POLITICS. THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I'VE SEEN. AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO ANOTHER POINT ABOVE THE PUBLIC REPRIMANDS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. THE BOARD QUOTED AND CAN BE A LITTLE TEAM. ONE OF THE THINGS. THE BOOK BOOK TODAY YEAH WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE COMMENTS THREE YES. WHEN I DO THAT CALCULATION FOR THE S. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY I GOT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE. THAT'S A FEAT. IT'S A TEAM OF HOW WE PLAY WITH NUMBERS IT'S A TEAM WHEN YOU PRESENT TOPLINE NUMBERS AND YOU DON'T REALLY GET INTO THE NUMBERS. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO DEEP IN THERE SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO THAT. BECAUSE I'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT. IS ANOTHER INTERESTING TO STATISTICS OUR- WE CYNICAL PROBATION CASES AROUND 72% OF ALL PROBATION CASES. WITH A LITTLE PUBLIC REPRIMAND. TWO YEARS PROBATION THIRTY FIVE MONTHS PROBATION AND THREE YEARS PROBATION I'LL TWO YEARS PROBATION WE SET ALL THAT UP 90% OF THE TIME. SO 73% OF THE TIME. WE DEVIATE. 40% FROM THE GUIDELINES ON AVERAGE. SO JUST THINK ABOUT THAT THINK THINK THINK WHAT THAT MEANS THAT MEANS IN THE REST OF THE TIME. IN THE OTHER 27% OF THE TIME. THAT'S WHEN WE FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES AND I CAN TELL YOU. MOST OF THE TIMES WHEN WE DO FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THOSE CASES NEEDED TO BE REBUILT. THOSE CASES ALSO AGREED JUST WE NEEDED TO TAKE A STAND BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE WILL TO REALLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC HE CAN SAY THAT ALL DAY AND ALL. WE CAN SAY THAT IT'S NOT PRESENT IN THE STATISTICS IT'S NOT PRESENT IN OUR BEHAVIOR AND GUESS WHAT THE PUBLIC TELLS US THAT ALL THE TIME. BY TELLING US THEY DO NOT TRUST US. YES THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT. WE DO NOT WE HAVE NOT AND THE TALKS. RECENTLY WHEN THE ALL COLLEAGUES WILL BE FOR THE SENATE. WELL CONFIRMATION HEARING SOMEONE WAS ONE OF ALL COLLEAGUES POINTED OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE PAYING. THEIR DISPLAYED THESE FEES AND YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS THAT THEY ARE IN STATE BOARD. BUT I WANT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ABOUT A LICENSING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE I'VE DONE A FEW OF THOSE IN MY LIFE. A LICENSING AGREEMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE. QUIET PLUS IN A BRAND. AND EVEN. BIASED THAT BRAND IS BUYING THAT REPUTATION. AND FOR MANY YEARS THROUGHOUT THE AGES DOCTORS HAVE BEING. THE PREMIUM BRAND. IN TERMS OF PUBLIC TRUST WELL THESE A. WELL DESERVED BECAUSE THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE GOOD BUT THE HE'S VERY VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF DOCTORS THAT DEVIATE FROM THAT STANDARD. SO WHEN WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES. WE DILUTE THE VERY INTEGRITY OF THE PROTECTION. THEN WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HOLD DOCTORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WRONGDOING AT THE LEVEL THAT WE CAN KNOCK IS MANY REASONS FOR THAT. I COULD SIT DOWN WITH OUR LEGAL COUNSEL AND WE CAN GO TO SECTIONS OF THIS LAW AND COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO DO THIS THAT WILL AID THIS. AB SOLUTIONS BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION. AND THAT'S WHY I'M A CHRISTIAN. I'VE ALWAYS GET BUT JUST WANTED THIS CONVERSATION. MISTER WATKINS I NEED TO GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE WARNING I APOLOGIZE BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT HERE VERY VERY SHORTLY BECAUSE I SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT AS WELL. SO I WILL WRAP UP ITS TEEN THIRTY FORTY SECONDS. CHECK OUT. THE OTHER THING THAT ANY USE THAT. WE DO NOT WE SAY WE APPLIED THE UNIFORMS STANDARD SIX AND FOURTEEN FORTY ONE AND WE DON'T. WE SAY WE UNDERMINE EXPENSE SOME MONTHS THAT EVERY TIME THAT THAT. FORTY PERCENT- THAT WE- RIGHT PUBLIC RECOMMENDS. AND ALL THAT TIME ALL OF THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS. EXPECTATIONS I'M GOING TO DISAGREE IT AT ACT ANY CONCLUSION. I'M LOOKING FORWARD LOOKING ATTITUDE CON A PROBLEM SOLVING PERSON THAT'S ONE COME TO. I WANT TO INVITE THE COMMITTEE. ONE AND DEFENDING TO REALLY ADDRESS THE MEDICAL BOARD'S CHALLENGES BECAUSE THEY ARE INTEGRAL INTEGRAL TO. OUR SOCIETY. AND I WANT TO ASK OF THIS COMMITTEE. THEN THEY WORK WITH US FIND THE RIGHT DATA AND INFORMATION. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL DATA TO WORK FROM. COME UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. I THINK THE COMMITTEE I THANK EVERYONE THAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE. AND I AM CONFIDENT NOW WE WOULD AT LEAST BEGIN TO START A DIALOGUE IN THE FIRST PLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WATKINS- LET ME JUST CHECK TO SEE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS OF OUR PANELISTS NONE HERE IN THE US SENATE CHAMBERS.

I'M AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FOR INJURED CAMPAIGN AND A CONSTITUENCY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM'S AND GROVER BEACH MY HUSBAND FONG WAS A CANCER SURVIVOR BURKE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN HE WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS WHILE ON THE DRUG PREDNISONE I CONTACTED HIS DOCTOR AT STANFORD MEDICAL CLINICS. AFTER TO EVALUATE ON A PRESCRIBED TREATMENT BUT DON STOCKTON REFUSED TO TREAT DONE WITH ANY DRUGS TO CONTROL HIS PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS AND WOULD NOT BE FOR US TO A PSYCHIATRIST HE SAID INSTEAD THAT HE WOULD BE FINE WHEN SHE WAS TAPERED OFF FRIENDS- AFTER ABOUT THREE WEEKS MY WORST FEARS WERE REALIZED. JOHN BECAME VERY DEPRESSED AND ON THE MORNING WHEN I DECIDED TO FIND A PSYCHIATRIST ON MY OWN YOU LEFT HOME AND NEVER RETURNED LATER DON'S BODY WAS FOUND HE DIED. BY A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. SUBSEQUENT I RESEARCH TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT AND DO SAIKIA YEAH. THE MAJORITY OF MEDICAL. STATED THAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED AND CLOSELY MONITORED. PREDNISONE REDUCED IMPOSSIBLE IN DRUGS PRESCRIBED FOR EXTREME CASES. WARNINGS WERE GIVEN TO WATCH FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR. WITH THIS INFORMATION IN MIND I FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DOCTOR WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. STATING THAT SHE HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT BY NOT EVALUATING AND TREATING DON FOR HIS PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS. TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT THE BOARD CONCLUDED THE DONS DOCTOR HAD ACTED WITHIN THE STANDARDS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE BY SIMPLY TO BRING DON OFF THE PREDNISONE. I THINK YOUR THE WHOLE REASON FOR MY COMPLAINT THE DORMS DOCTOR HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT BY NOT EVALUATED MONITORING. AND TREATING DON FOR HIS PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS CAUSED BY THE PRINTERS ON THE UNION TO STAND ON THE CASE BECAUSE THEY CLOSED IT WITHOUT ONE SPEAKING TO ME. IT WAS AS IF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER PURPOSELY SOUGHT TO EXONERATE DON'S DOCTOR INSTEAD OF HOLDING HER ACCOUNTABLE. PLEASE HOLD THE MEDICAL BOARD MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

I AM HONORED MODERN HER PREGNANCY CLOSELY. SHE WAS STILL TO ATTEND COLLEGE GRADUATION. BUT SHE NEVER GOT TO WEAR HER CAP AND GOWN. EXCEPT FOR TO CREATE. BECAUSE SHE DIED DUE TO MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE ONE MONTH BEFORE HER COLLEGE GRADUATION. RIGHT RIGHT HAD A HEALTHY. UNTIL IT STRANGE WELL INTERNET A CONDITION. WELL MY DAUGHTER COULDN'T BREATHE. SHE HAD VISION PROBLEMS PROTEIN IN HER URINE AND BLOOD PRESSURE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. SHE HAD EVERY SIGN A PRE CRAPPIE. BUT THOSE WERE IGNORED BY TWO DOCTORS. SHE TRIED SO HARD TO GET HELP FOR HER- AND FORMS THAT. BUT HER DOCTORS WOULD NOT HELP HER. SHE WAS IN TROUBLE. BUT HER REGULAR OBGYN WOULD NOT SEE- HELLO.

WE HAD AN INVESTIGATOR COME TO MY HOME WITHOUT WARNING BEFORE WE EVEN FILED A COMPLAINT. WE HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED BY AN INVESTIGATOR INTEGRATE TAKE RATED BY MAKING US FEEL LIKE WE DID SOMETHING WRONG. WHEN WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO PREPARE OUR COMPLAINT. WE WERE DISCOURAGED FROM DOING SO.

PREVIOUSLY CHANGED WILL BE WHAT SHE HAD LEARNED THAT HER PRIOR DOCTOR HAD BEEN DISCIPLINED FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. SEARCHING FOR NEVER HEALTHCARE SHE CHANGED DOCTORS ONLY TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF ANOTHER DANGEROUS DR. THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS NO VALUE FOR MOTHERS BY. HOW COULD THE MEDICAL BOARD JUSTIFY ALLOWING A DOCTOR. TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE KNOWING HE IS LINKED TO DEATH OF THE BABY.

AFFECTED MOTHERS AND BABIES WHERE ELSE CAN SOMEONE BE LINKED TO THE DEATHS OF SIX PEOPLE AND BE PRETTY ON PROBATION. THE MEDICAL BOARD KEEPS GIVING HIM HER PROBATION AND PROTECTING THE DOCTOR OVER PATIENT FRAZIER. IT IS NOW THE TRYING TO OVERHAUL THE MEDICAL CORPS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT.

HIS VISION FOR GIVEN OPTIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE TO COMPLETE AND DO YOU EVER DO. ONLY THE MEDIC RECORD IS VERY CUTE. EMAIL VOICE OR EVEN PATIENT NOTES ARE NOT RUBIO. THERE IS NO APPEAL PROCESS AFTER COMPLAINTS DOES NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THE MEDICAL BOARD'S CURRENT INVESTIGATION PROCESSES ADEQUATE. SHOP COMMITTEE CALLED INVESTIGATION WITHOUT A SINGLE INTERVIEW WITHOUT A REVIEW OF ALL RECORD AND WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK. BY REFUSING TO REVIEW EVIDENCE OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THE MEDICAL COURT DEMONSTRATES A BIAS IN FAVOR OF PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITAL.

AND ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY SALAS JUNIOR. MY GRANDDAUGHTER SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED HER BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER WITH NO PROBLEMS. SHE WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE HER BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT THEN THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING GIVING BIRTH AND WITH NO CONSENT HER DOCTOR FORCIBLY REMOVED A PLACENTA. FIRST BY HAND THEN BY FORCE THAT AND THEN AGAIN BY HAND. I COULD HEAR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AGONIZING SCREAMS FROM DOWN THE HALLWAY. WHILE FORCIBLY REMOVING HER PLACENTA HE PORTRAYED AT HER UTERUS AND CERVIX MY GRANDDAUGHTER BLED TO DEATH WELL THE NURSES BACKING A DOCTOR TO HELP HER. HER DOCTOR GAVE HER NO LIFESAVING SUPPORT. HER VITALS COMMITTED WHILE SHE DIED. WE WERE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE- PROGRESS MY CRAFT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY IN SIGHT WE WENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND FILED A COMPLAINT. MY COMPLAINT WAS INVESTIGATED AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS REPEAT OFFENDER DR. WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A HEARING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. HE HAD BEEN ON PROBATION BEFORE FOR THE DEATHS OF TWO BABIES. WHY ARE WE FELT THAT HE WOULD FINALLY BE DISCIPLINED BUT THE GROUND. FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S DEATH. BUT DID NOT HAVE. HE WAS OFFERED A SETTLEMENT A PLEA DEAL. THAT GAVE HIM PROBATION ONCE AGAIN THE MEDICAL BOARD REVIEW THAT THIS DOCTOR HAD BEEN HARMING MOTHERS AND BABIES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. BUT THEY CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO PRACTICE AND CONTINUE. TO HARM OTHERS HOW THE MEDICAL BOARD TAKEN ADVISES EARLIER A YOUNG MOTHER AND BABY WHO DIED AFTER MY GRANDDAUGHTER CELESTE.

NOT ONLY THAT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE PHYSICIAN BE PRESENT OR AT LEAST CLOSE EITHER WAY HE'S GOING TO KEEP AN EYE OUT SINC. THE MOVIE IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL NGUYEN TENDENCIES BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD THAT HE HAD A HOBBY PRESIDENT OF SUCH HEARING ON GEORGIA HEALTH. HARD DIDN'T NEED MIGHT WHILE WHOLE APPLICATION GOALS BY AGES WE JUST LANDED IN A RECORD. LAS THERE SHOULD BE ON PART ALL HUMAN FEEDING. THE HOUSE IS NOT. WE GO ON LEGAL AUTHORITY. TO ACT BEHALF OF THE ALL. ESPECIALLY WHEN. EVERY AT THE END OF THE LOOKING. THANK YOU. WITHOUT ANY ASSESSMENT OR CONSENT WHICH CAUSED TWO YEAH THIS WAS TOTALLY PREVENTABLE. AFTER I COMPLAINED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD THE INVESTIGATOR PROMISED AN ACCUSATION AND CORPORATION FOR THE DOCTOR OVERPRESCRIBED AND THEN FALSIFIED A DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER. LATER I RECEIVED A LETTER THAT THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO YOU DOWN TO A PUBLIC LETTER OF REPRIMAND. IT TOOK TWO OR THREE YEARS HELLO PLR.

TO BOTH COMMITTEES SO WE CAN MAKE THIS A MATTER OF THE RECORD AND CONSIDER THIS DURING OUR- FURTHER SUNSET TO. REVIEW DELIBERATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THANK YOU AGAIN. MODERATOR NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU I'M THIRTY SEVEN FOUR I HAD. HELLO MY NAME IS A GREATER DELEON AND I'M FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA I AM WITH THE FURNITURE EDUCATION BACK BY REPRESENTATIVES ARE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR MELISSA HURTADO AND ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY SALAS UNION. I HELD MY SON UNTIL HE TOOK HIS LAST BREATH. HE ONLY LIVED FOR EIGHTEEN HOURS AND DIED DUE TO MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. MY SON BOUGHT TO LIVE BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE BECAUSE THE DOCTORS OVERSEEING HIS CARE MADE ERROR AFTER ERROR. IN HIS MEDICAL RECORDS THE DOCTORS CLAIM THAT THEY TRANSFERRED MY SON IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEXT YEAR BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH. WHEN I FIRST SAW MY SON HE WAS IN A FULL SEASON ALONG WITH NO DOCTOR SPENDING AND- MY SON WAS ONLY TRANSFERRED TO THE NECK-YOU ONCE I WAS THERE. HOW COULD ANY DOCTOR KNOWING MY SON CONDITION LEAVE HIM UNATTENDED. AND THE NEXT YEAR THE DOCTOR WASTED TIME TRYING TO ENROLL MALACHI INTO A CLINICAL TRIAL INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY AIRLIFTING AND FOR A HOSPITAL WITH THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED IT. THEY WAITED ALMOST NINE HOURS TO TRANSFER MY SON TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL AT THE FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE. AFTER MY SON'S DEATH I LEARNED THAT ONE OF HIS DOCTORS HAD LOTS HOSPITAL PRIVILEGES FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF ANOTHER PRODUCT. FOLLOWING MY SON AND HIS MOTHER'S DEATH THE SAME DOCTOR ALSO LOST PRIVILEGES AT A HOSPITAL LEAVING THE DOCTOR WITH NO PRIVILEGES AT ANY HOSPITAL IN THE MEDICAL BOARD TOOK NO ACTION ON THIS DOCTOR LOSING HOSPITAL PRIVILEGES. WITHIN A LOT OF HOSPITAL PRIVILEGES BORN A MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATION. THE MEDICAL BOARD IT'S FAILING FAMILIES I BELIEVE A PUBLIC BOARD MAJID MEMBER MAJORITY WILL PROVIDE A MORE DIVERSE VOICES AT THE MICRO CAP IS NOT PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FAMILY. WE GO TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO MAKE THE DOCTORS ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEIR FOCUS IS ON PROTECTING DOCTORS OVER PATIENTS. I BELIEVE THAT ADDING TWO STEPS FOR FAMILIES IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS INCLUDING THE INTERVIEWING THE FAMILY BEFORE DISMISSING A COMPLAINT. AND GIVING THE FAMILY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AFTER THE POSITIONS INTERVIEW WILL GIVE FAMILIES ABLE. CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO NO OTHER FATHER IS FACED WITH LOSING HIS FAMILY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TESTIFY NEXT MODERATOR. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DENISE JOHNSON.

THANK YOU BYE NINETY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. I COULD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SANDRA PRESENT I'M FROM HYSTERIA SUMMARY COUNTY AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY HUSBAND ASKED ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR FAMILY AND OTHER PATIENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED HARM DUE TO MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. AND WE'RE ALSO REPRESENTING THE PARENTS FOR INJURED PATIENTS ACT CAMPAIGN. WE ARE SENATOR CONSTITUENTS OF SENATOR WILK WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A MONTH BEFORE HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN TWO MONTHS BEFORE HER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION OUR SEVENTEEN YEAR RESULT OF THE EGREGIOUS MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. JORDAN MORE THAN JUST MISDIAGNOSIS. SHE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WE TRUSTED TO HELP FOR. PHYSICIANS LIKE NORTH HER SYMPTOMS HER TEST RESULTS. AND LACKED ANY COORDINATED CARE BETWEEN THE SPECIALISTS TO CONTINUE TO PASS ALONG. WITHOUT DIRECTION DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. WE WERE LATER TOLD HOW THE DOCTORS ON THEIR JOB JORDAN WOULD STILL BE HERE AND TO DATE NOBODY HAS BEEN HELD RESPONSIBLE. IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AFTER JORDAN'S DAD. WE FILED MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD AFTER INQUIRY WITH MISS JENNA JONES OFFICE IN TWENTY TWENTY ALL OF OUR COMPLAINTS WERE COMPOSED. CAUSED BY THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT UNIT WITHOUT A COMPLAIN INTERVIEW AND NO MEDICAL CONSULTANT REVIEW. WE HAVE HAD NO RECOURSE TO APPEAL AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF WE CAN RESUBMIT AS A NEW COMPLAINT. WE WERE INFORMED BY MULTIPLE PERSONS OUTSIDE THE STATE AGENCIES THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD FREQUENTLY CLOSES COMPLAINTS FOR THE POSITION MAY BE PART OF RELATED ACTIVE LITIGATION. THIS REQUIRES CLARIFICATION AND FORTHCOMING RESPONSE FROM THIS BOARD. OVER THE LAST YEAR I'VE LEARNED THAT MUCH A COMPLAINT IS FILED. IN THE CONTEXT IN JORDAN OF THE AGENCY COMPLAINTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DISMISSED WITHOUT COMPLAINT AN INTERVIEW OR CONSULTANT REVIEW AS LAYPERSONS THE PUBLIC IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE COMPONENTS NECESSARY FOR EXTRA SEX AFTER SEXUAL COMPLAINT AND ASSOCIATED REVIEW. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY HAS SUBMITTED A NEW COMPLAINT THIS TIME CITED AND SOURCED AND STILL HAVE NOT HAD AN INTERVIEW AND ONLY AN EMAIL REQUEST TO PROVIDE JORDAN'S DEATH CERTIFICATE. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT JUST RECENTLY PASSED THE CENTRAL COMPLAINT YOU KNOW TO THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS MISS JONES TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. THE AVERAGE PROCESS FROM COMPLAINT TO DISCIPLINE IF NOT DISMISS. IT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED DAYS WHICH IS NOT ONLY UNACCEPTABLE BUT OFFENSIVE. THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM AND THE PEOPLE HARMED BY MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE DESERVE JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS DESERVE BETTER. HERE'S A DOCTOR'S POLICING THEMSELVES HAVE LED TO NEGLIGENT DOCTORS CONTINUING TO PRACTICE WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCE. COUPLED WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF MICRO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS LEFT UNCHECKED.

THE COMPLAINT STATUS VERIFICATION BEEN CHECKPOINTS COMPLETED FIFTY SIX TO BE ONLINE INTERVIEWS WITH THE COMPLAIN THAT MULTIPLE STEPS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND A COST RECOVERY POLICIES. BASED ON RECENT STATEMENTS AND LACK OF PREPAREDNESS I AM NOT CONVINCED ALL MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE CURRENT ABYSMAL STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD.

AND WITHIN AN ORANGE COUNTY HOSPITAL THAT ALEX WAS GIVEN A LETHAL COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS AND MANY WITH LEFT ON MONITORED FOR MORE THAN SEVEN HOURS. HE WAS- IT WAS FOUND DEAD IN BED. DURING MORNING ROUNDS AND HE WAS ALREADY IN REPORTERS- I TURN TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA TO STOP THIS DANGEROUS DOCTOR FROM KILLING ANOTHER PATIENT. I THOUGHT SURELY THIS REGULATORY AGENCY WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND TAKES ACTION AGAINST THE DANGEROUS DOCTOR WHO KILLED MY SON. I THOUGHT THEY WERE THERE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT I WOULD SAY OVERALL. MY COMPLAINT AGAINST DOCTOR DANIEL HEADRICK INVOLVING THE DEATH OF OUR- SHIPS FOR. FOUR LONG YEARS TO REACH A DECISION. AFTER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FILED AN ACTIVATION RECOMMENDING STRICT DISCIPLINARY ACTION INCLUDING REVOCATION OF THE DOCTOR'S LICENSE. A SECRET BACKROOM DEAL WESTROCK AND THE DOCTOR GOT AWAY WITH A PUBLIC REPRIMAND NOTHING MORE THAN A SLAP ON THE WRIST FOR KILLING MY SON. THE MEDICAL BOARD COMPLETELY ONCE AGAIN THEIR OWN DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO TALK TO ME I WAS INFORMED VIA EMAIL AFTER THE DECISION WAS FINALIZED AND I HAD TO READ THROUGH A MULTI PAGE DOCUMENTS TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME. THE COMPLAINT PROCESS WHICH COLD. SENSITIVE TO MY GRIEVING FAMILY ALL ALONG THE WAY. THE MISSION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD TO PROTECT HEALTHCARE. CONSUMER BUT MY IT. VERIA CAL. SHOW THAT WOULD RATHER PER. HER STOCK THAT PROTECT PATIENTS. I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IN THE LAST CONTROLLED MEDICAL CORD- AND SO I FULLY SUPPORT A PUBLIC MEMBER MAJORITY TO HELP INSURE THAT THE MEDICAL PORTERFIELD'S ITS MISSION A PATIENT PROTECTION. IT'S LONG PAST TIME FOR CHANGE. THE FIGHT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE EIGHT YEARS AGO AND I AM DEEPLY SADDENED AND FRUSTRATED SO VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC I IMPORTANT COMMITTEE TO HELP US TO HELP PROTECT ALL HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD APPRECIATE AND WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO. WORK WITH YOU ON MEANINGFUL REFORM THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR SPENDING THE TIME GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU WE'RE TRULY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS MA'AM AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU STAYED ON AND TOOK THE TIME. TO SPEAK TO US TODAY. MODERATOR NECKS PLEASE. THANK YOU THIRTY TWO GO AHEAD. HELLO YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED LOUDLY. HELLO CAN YOU-HEAR ME WE CANNOT ALLOW IN CLEAR JUST MAKE SURE YOU SPEAK LOUDLY. THE OKAY SO I'M AND WE CAN BECOME ADOPTED CERTAIN OUT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY I ACTUALLY I'M PRESIDENT OF THE HEALTH EQUITY WITH KNOWLEDGE YOU COMPANY MEMBERS HOLLISTER AND I'M ACTUALLY A CONSTITUENT. OF OUR CENTER TO LAW. WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS EVERYTHING EVERYONE IS SAID I AGREE WITH I AGREE THERE'S DANGERS DOCTORS I AGREE THAT THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THE PROCESS TO PROCEED AS IT SHOULD. I ALSO AGREE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ADVERSITY WITHIN HEALTHCARE. CURRENTLY 43% OF BLACK POSITIONS ARE THAT HAVE A LIFE THE CALIFORNIA WILL BE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND SUBJECT TO LICENSE YOUR DISHES. FOR AS ASIAN AND WHITE POSITIONS ARE IN THE TWENTIETH PERCENTILE THIS IS THE DATA FROM THE C. R. B. THAT WAS PUBLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WELL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT COMPLAIN THEY GET SENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD- THE MEDICAL MORE OFTEN WILL TRY TO PERSUADE COMPLAINER. INCLUDING POSITION BUT NOT THE FALL COMPLAINING BECAUSE- A VEGAN RETALIATION THIS INCLUDES. EVEN WORKPLACE VIOLENCE. THE MEDICAL BOARD EXPERTS. I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THEM MAY HAVE NEED FOR WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE OF THE ACTUAL KEEP THAT THERE'S TO REPRESENT. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE MATTER BOARD KEEP KICKING THEM. THAT THEY THE HIGH. HIGH CASE THE MEDICAL BOY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO. CASE FROM. OF THE COMMUNITY. LOS CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE HOT. FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD NOW LOW. AND NOT ONLY BUT THE CITY HAHA HAVE BEEN EXACT. AT THAT LOOKS. INTERFERE WITH THAT HEY THIS IS ACTUAL FACT THAT HAVE HAPPENED. WHAT MICHAEL DID MANAGE LOOKING AT THIS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA- REVIEW BUREAU THE RESEARCH REPORT I NOTICED OF STANCIL DATA ISSUES THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THE TEMPERATURES ARE AWARE OF. THE DATA IN THE TABLE HAS BEEN ALTERED FOR INSTANCE NATIVE AMERICANS TO SUGGEST THAT COMPLAINTS ARE NOT AS BAD OR NOT IS A DISTRICT ARE NOT. LESS DISCRIMINATION IS IN THE SYSTEM. AND THE TABES IF YOU LOOK AT IT NATIVE AMERICANS WORK INCREASED A HUNDRED AND. IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN THE SAME FACTOR CAL. BUT LACKS A FIVE. ASIAN FORTY NINE PER OF THE CHECK. AND THIS WAS REFLECTED IN TRYING TO REDUCE THE OVER NUMBER TO SHOW THERE WAS NO DISPARATE IMPACT DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE BOARD'S PROCEDURES. ADDITIONALLY CRITICAL THERE ARE VARIABLES ARE MISSING FROM THE REPORT SUCH AS AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT PATIENTS REALLY WANT TO GET TO. IS THAT THERE'S NO DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THAT DEALS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE DECISION THAT MEANS WE DON'T KNOW THE RACE OR ETHNICITY IN YOU NEED TO INVESTIGATORS THE CONSULTANTS ARCHITECTS BURKE THESE ARE CRITICAL VARIABLES THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN HE- DOES. THAT THERE'S ALSO NO DATA ON WHETHER OR NOT BE COMPLETED YOU COMING FROM HOSPITALS. OR WHETHER THEY'RE COMING FROM PATIENTS. BUT HAVE BEEN PLAYING A LOT ABOUT BEING ASKED TO LEAVE COMMUNITY DIRECTLY. PUBLIC ENEMY. THEN IF THEY DON'T. THE BILL THREAT WITH COMPLAINT. OF EIGHT OH FIVE RECALL. HERE IS RESOLUTION. FIRST CRB REPORT INACCURATE BROKE PEOPLE ARE AND I BELIEVE TO SHOULD HAPPEN UNIVERSITY ARE V. SHOULD GO BACK AND REPRODUCE RECORD STEVIE AND INVEST IT DEPENDED EXTERNAL REPORT. TO INCLUDE NEVER ONE TO MISS CARE THAT I'M- FOR THIS PURPOSE EVERY HOT SHOULD BE IN AND OVER. OF THOSE IN THE AND OF TO HOSPITAL WHICH INCLUDES A PRIEST IN X. SCREENING PROCESS WHICH THEY NOW HAPPEN. TO ANYTHING DID NOT TO THAT. NUMBER THREE HISTORY THE ISSUE OF INPUT THE BIAS THE SCREEN. AND IT GIVE FOR PATIENTS SAFETY MY RECOMMENDATION YET THAT SOMEONE KILLED DOCTOR CROWD TWO ONE THAT YOU GET AT ONE HAVE FORCE. IN I AGREE SHOULD BE PEOPLE NUMBER. ON THAT THAT PAN QUICKLY. AND NINE OPPOSITION BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO FORCE SHOULD BE TO A- OF DENTURES IN THIS PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH HELLO EQUITIES AND TO REALLY GET TO THE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THIS BOARD. I APPRECIATE YOU FOR TIME I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENACTED SPEAK THE THAT THEY ARE THE IMPORTANT IT NEEDS TO BE. AND I ACCEPT BACK IN. PUBLIC WILL BUT THAT YOU CAN WRITE. HELLO THERE WAS ONE. UNDER FEDERAL LAW. FOR THE NINE BUT LACKS CERTAIN OPPORTUNITY. THANK THEY DESERVE. AND THE ARE THE KIND OF THING THAT WE DON'T NEED ANY HELP. BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THAT US UP FOR PATIENTS NOT BEING A TO ACT QUALITY HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TIME DOCTOR THANKS FOR TESTIMONY MONTEREY NEXT PLAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ONE OF SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK GOODNESS CRISTINA HILDEBRAND FROM AVOID CONTRACT ADVOCACY AND I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND T. J. WATKINS FOR. GIVING US WHAT HE ALWAYS DOES THE MEDICAL BOARD MEETINGS WHICH WE ATTEND EVERY SINGLE- QUARTERS AND WHICH IS SPEAKING OUT GOING CUT TRYING T SHAKE SHAKE THE BORDER SO I REALLY HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY- AND RECOGNIZES WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS. SAYING WHICH IS THAT THE TRUST IN THE PUBLIC. TRUST OF THE MEDICAL BOARD IT'S JUST NOT THERE I ONE OF THE UNDERLYING THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE WHILE THE POSITION PUBLIC MEMBERSHIP IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE AND IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE MORE PUBLIC MEMBERS POSITION. OUT ONE OF THE OTHER HE ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE POSITION MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE AMOUNT OF LOBBYING THAT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DOES. TO THE MEDICAL BOARD- AND THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT AND HE- IS AMAZING AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW. I THINK ONLY 40% OF THE NATION'S IN CALIFORNIA ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE- RESIDENTS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE. STILL IN MEDICAL- GETTING THEIR MEDICAL DEGREES AND WORK IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OUT OF OUT OF SCHOOL THEY ARE NOT THE POSITIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW THAT ARE HAVE BEEN PRACTICING CALIFORNIA FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TECHNICIAN REALLY IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF. PETITIONS IN CALIFORNIA YES THE MEDICAL BOARD IS MADE UP MAJORITY POSITION WHAT PART OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE LOBBY AND BIAS BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. REALLY OFF THE LEGISLATURE OR THINGS TO LOOK AT THAT AND FEELING SURE THAT WHEN POSITIONS ARE- ARE MAKE IT OR YOU KNOW PUT IN PLACE. IN IN THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT THEY FROM AWAY. OF POSITIONS AND THAT ARE NOT. A RECORD- PART OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL STATE OR OFF THE TIDE WITH THE MATTER A BIG WHICH IS ON MY BEING AN ACTOR APPLICATION.
