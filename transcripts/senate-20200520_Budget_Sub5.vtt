CERTAINLY WHEN I GO THROUGH OUR

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:34.747
ENTIRE AGENDA I SEE THAT THE

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:37.049
MAY REVISED DID WITHDRAW THE

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.918
NUMBER OF EXPENDITURES AND DID

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.654
LESSEN OR REDUCE EXPENDITURES

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.723
WITHIN CDC ARE AS IT IS IT IT

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.758
ALSO IN A NUMBER OF OTHER

DEPARTMENTS THE JUDICIARY DO G.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.096

ARE CERTAIN- PROGRAMS ARE

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:56.602
CERTAIN PARTS OF CDC ARE WHICH

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.338
I WOULD NOT WANT TO OR EXPECT

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:02.341
AB SEE REDUCTIONS BUT WHAT I AM

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.977
SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT THAT WE

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.612
NOT BE MORE EFFICIENCY OUT

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.281
THERE COULD NOT BE A NEED SOME

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.150
ADDITIONAL NEW SPENT. THAT

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.352
WOULD BE READ STE THAT MY

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.954
ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR SOME OF

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.323
THESE CUTS NOW I KNOW THAT WHAT

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:22.628
WAS JUST EXPLAINED IS THAT IF

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:29.034
THE IF FEDERAL ACT IS SET THAT

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:32.571
THE SEE. THE RIVER THE MIGHT

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:33.973
COME BACK AND SAY LET'S GIVE

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.341
BACK ON THESE CARS BUT TRIGGER

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:41.213
QUE. BUT I GET I. WANT TO WHAT

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.781
MONEY I WILL GET THAT THE

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:43.349
THAT'S THE HOPE BUT NOT AN

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:46.018
EXPERT. AND WHAT I WOULD ARE

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.720
NOT A GUARANTEE AND WHAT I

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:50.322
WOULD HOPE IS THAT WE COULD

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.491
FIND SOME ADDITIONAL

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.792
EFFICIENCIES AND AS WE GO

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.194
THROUGH THE RIGHT OR CHEN. THEY

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:56.595
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISCUSS

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.631
MEANT TO DETAIL. YOU'LL SEE

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.299
THAT I AM AT LEAST RECOMMENDING

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.668
THE REJECTION OF A FEW ITEMS OF

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.604
EXPENDITURE. THAT I FEEL. AT

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:08.007
THIS POINT ARE. APPROPRIATE

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.375
GIVEN THE KIND OF DEFICIT WE'RE

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.977
EXPERIENCING AND WHILE THE

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.079
THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT ITEMS THAT

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:16.582
I'M NECESSARILY. CONJOINING OR

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.717
TRYING TO THE TRIGGER ITEMS I

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.686
JUST RAISE THEM BECAUSE I THINK

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.454
A FEW OF THESE TRIGGER ITEMS.

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.090
ARE AREAS THAT ARE VERY

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.692
IMPORTANT THEY WERE IMPORTANT

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.093
TO THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.528
WHEN WE ADOPTED IT BUT THE

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.597
CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT TODAY

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:34.600
FOR EXAMPLE. THE ADULT REENTRY

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.369
GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE AS WE

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.604
KNOW IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.973
BUSINESS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.875

STATE FACILITIES EVERY MONTH

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.680
THAT'S JUST A NORMAL NORMAL DAY

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:49.682
TO DAY. AND NOW THEY ARE

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.984

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:53.652
ABILITY TO GET A JOB AS PRIDE

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.587
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.956
PROBLEM SIXTEEN WE SELL. AND

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:01.193

GIVE YOU FOR WE'RE GONNA CUT

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.721
SENIORS THAN YOUR RACE BECAUSE

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.523
GO WHY WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.024
BECAUSE- IT'S- IT'S NOW THE

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:48.360
MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENT OF OUR

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:50.963
POPULATION THAT. COULD BE

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:53.365
HARMED BY THE CORONA VIRUS. BUT

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.533
IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.602
ISN'T DONE STRATEGICALLY IT'S

00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:59.171
DONE FOR EMOTIONAL REASONS AND-

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.273
IN THIS OKAY WE'RE GONNA CUT.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.008
PLEASE PUBLIC SAFETY OR YOU

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:06.545
KNOW. IT'S SORT OF A KIND OF

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:10.415
AVAILABLE KIND OF THREAT TO ME-

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.783
TO GARNER SOME KIND OF FEDERAL

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.119
SUPPORT ACT I DON'T KNOW IF

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:17.256
THAT'S THE- I MEAN IT'S- D.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.924
WHOEVER IT IS ALWAYS A STRATEGY

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:25.397
BUT- NO. IF IT'S- BECOMING OF

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.566
THE LARGEST STATE IN THE

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.435
COUNTRY SO I'M I'M I'M-

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.472
WONDERING MANAGER IT TO GO BIG

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:34.740
AND GO BOLD ONE WHERE WE JUST

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:38.777
MAKING A 10% CUT HERE WHEN WE

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.245
MAKE A 25% AND JUST. FOR

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:43.949
LOOKING JUST FOR. THEATRICS TO

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.318
TRY AND IMPRESSED WASHINGTON DC

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.686
TO DO SOMETHING THE BILL WAS

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:51.523
OUT IN. WE GO BIGGER ANGLE

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.827
BOLTS. IN ITS MAYBE MY WAY OF

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:59.031
REACTING TO THE TO THE STRATEGY

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:01.800
HERE BECAUSE I SEE THIS AS A

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.535
BLUFF AND I AND THAT'S WHY I

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.871
THINK IT'S TACKY JUST. I THINK

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:07.272
OF A BETTER STRATEGY COULD BE

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:11.276
UTILIZED BEFORE WE MAY AT AYE

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:13.045
AYE WILLOW SENATOR BILL AND

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.347
THEN WE MIGHT HEAR FROM

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:15.914
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:18.250
THINK. I THINK THE POINT THAT.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:21.219
WELL YOUR YOUR POINT CENTER

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.221
MORE LIKE IS WELL TAKEN AT

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.857
LEAST IN AND DIFFERENT OF WE

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.693
HAVE A DIFFERENT NUMBER A VERY

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:30.696
PART MINSITER BEFORE US RIGHT

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:31.863
WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.332
JUSTICE WE HAVE THE JUDICIAL

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.033
BRANCH. AB OEM PARTS OF IT NOT

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.202
ALL AND WE A FEW OTHER THINGS

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.938
CDC ARE AND THE POINT I WAS

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:43.141
MAKING IT IT'S AN I DON'T KNOW

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.944
ADVOCATES FOR JUST A FLAT OUT

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.313
10% EVERY DEPART. BUT ONLY I

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.416
THINK IT I JUST IT AT LEAST IN

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.485
THE CASE OF THE DISEASE WHICH

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:57.956
IS A SEVENTY NINE BILLION

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:04.096
DOLLARS THE PART ALL. AMOUNT

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:05.697
THE DIRECTIONS THAT HARPER US

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.165
IN THE MAYBE. EQUAL IN TOTAL

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:09.735
LET THAN ONE PER. AND WHEREAS

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.737
EVERY OTHER AGENCY REGARDING

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:14.640
REGARDLESS OF ITS DOLLAR SIZE

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.708
WHETHER IT'S A FORTY BILLION

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.578
DOLLAR A TEN BILLION OR A FIFTY

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.947
SIX BILLION HAS A MUCH LARGER

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.548
PERCENT CUT THEY DON'T THEY'RE

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.884
NOT THE SAME THEY'RE NOT AT ALL.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.487
AND THE ONLY THING THAT.

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:31.056
THERE'S WE ARE I FELT THAT WE

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.958
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A FEW

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.993
MORE EFFICIENCIES WITHIN CDC

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.497
ARE- KNOWINGTHAT WE STILL

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.265
ABSOLUTELY MUST PROTECT PUBLIC

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:44.269
SAFETY- BUT I ALSO NOTICED THAT

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.938
THERE WERE A FEW. WHO OWLS

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:50.409
BEING A RECOMMENDED FOR CDC ARE

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.944
SO NEW EXPENDITURES AND AGAIN

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.713
NOT THAT WE SHOULD REJECT ALL

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.381
NEW EXPENDITURES CLEARLY IN A

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:58.250
TIME OF ENDEMIC THEIR

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.419
APPROPRIATE NEW EXPENDITURES

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:04.122
BUT THERE SEEM TO BE SOME THAT

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.024
MAYBE RIGHT NOW JUST START

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.927
WARRANTED OLD THAT WAS REPLETE

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.729
I WAS GONNA BAKE AND THE POINT

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.898
I TRYING TO MAKE THIS TO ME

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.200
WHEN I CONTRAST. THE WHAT

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.369
THINGS WERE SO THE FOR A

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:19.404
TRIGGER CUT VERSUS THOSE THINGS

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:26.545
THAT ARE NEW. OF CENTER ABOUT.

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:28.547
WERE UNKNOWN DIFFERENT TIMES IN

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:33.518
NORMAL AND BUT I NOTICED SOME.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.721
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CUTS

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:37.322
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE NOW AND

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.392
THE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AREA.

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:46.565
AND THE CUTS THAT TOOK PLACE

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.166
DURING THE ROUTE LAST RECESSION

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.435
IT IS APPEARS TO ME THAT A LOT

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:52.738
OF THE SAME CUTS ARE BEING MADE

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:55.006
WE'RE SORT OF CUTTING ON THE

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.808
EDGES OF THE DEPARTMENT. OF A

00:22:56.875 --> 00:23:02.080
CORRECTION- PERHAPS NOT TRUE

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:03.815
WITH THE JUDICIARY I THINK

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.217
WE'RE CUTTING INTO THOSE ARE

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:06.651
THE BASIC PART OF THE

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:09.788
JUDICIARY- WITH THESE TRIGGER

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:14.726
MECHANISMS BUT- THE DEPARTMENT

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:15.293
OF CORRECTIONS I THINK THERE

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.698
ARE CUT IT- THE DIFFERENT

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:23.368
SERVICES THAT ARE. FUNDED OF

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.836
THEIR IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.439
THE DEPARTMENT AND SO FORTH- I

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:31.176
REMEMBER THE LAST- GO AROUND

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.879
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE CUT. A

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:37.449
LOT OF THE PROGRAMS. AND THE

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:41.353
RESULT WAS THAT WE I HAD- A

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.655
REDUCE RECIDIVISM WE HAD- AN

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:45.190
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:48.126
IN- FACILITIES WITH MENTAL

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:50.495
HEALTH PROBLEMS OR BEHAVIORAL

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.097
PROBLEMS OF I'D SAY IT THAT WAY

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:54.733
BE MORE PERHAPS MORE CORRECTLY

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.569
PUT IT. AND THAT IT MUST OF

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.004
INCARCERATION BECAUSE THE

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.940
LEVELS OF THE INMATES SO

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:04.743
INCREASED. SO NOW WE'RE IN A

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.044
SITUATION WHERE WE'RE INDEED

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.648
HAVING A DECREASING POPULATION

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:14.152
AND IT KIND OF. DOES CENTERS.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:21.927
PERHAPS. MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.428
A DECREASE IN A POPULATION

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:25.530
WITHOUT AT LEAST EXAMINING WHAT

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:28.099
IS GOING ON IN THAT DEPARTMENT

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:31.136
AND WHAT. WHY WE CAN REDUCE

00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:33.271
SAID. BASED ON THE DECREASING

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:35.841
POPULATION SO FOR ME I LIKE TO

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:38.710
KNOW- SOME RESUMES SOME

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.178
STATISTICS OKAY WHAT IS THE

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:43.481
POPULATION. NOT NOT IN THE MAY

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:46.017
REVISE WHICH IS AN OLD NUMBER

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:48.720
WHAT IS A POPULATION NOW WERE

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:51.990
WERE GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:52.524
WERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:54.226
CHANGING I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:56.394
THE POPULATION AS- OF THE

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.964
GOVERNOR'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.901
CLUB THING FACILITIES. IS

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:08.673
INDEED THAT HAVE. OF THE VIRUS.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.712
SPREADING IN THE PRISONS. HOW

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.180
MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE VIRUS IN

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:21.286
THE PRISONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:24.055
THERE'S ONE OR TWO ONE

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:25.724
PARTICULAR PRISON HAS A LOT OF

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.293
THE VIRUS AND I BELIEVE IT'S

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.728
THE CHINO FACILITY BUT I'M NOT

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:32.697
SURE THAT IT IS A PANEL FIRST

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:35.267
AND- AT THE SAME TIME WHEN

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.836
THEY'RE- THERE IS- THERE'S

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:41.907
REQUIRE US TO. HOLD OFF.

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:44.943
CLOSING A FACILITY THAT HAS AN

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.978
OUTBREAK OF THE VIRUS WHICH IS

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.214
GOING TO COST US MORE MONEY

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.515
DEAL WITH RATHER THAN. MAYBE

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:53.785
LOOK AT YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.520
THAT HAVE A VIRUS IN ONE PRISON

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.554
THERE MIGHT BE A DECISION TO

00:25:56.621 --> 00:26:00.892
ACTUALLY. LOOK AT IT MAYBE.

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:02.694
SHOULD WE SHOULD WE LOOK AT. IN

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.429
A MEDICAL CENTER SHOULD WE LOOK

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:06.231
AT- MAYBE MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.166
THAT FACILITY. I'M IS THAT

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.303
OFFICE THE- THAT WE SHOULD-

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.305
MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF I WOULD

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.639
QUESTION THAT I WOULD RAISE

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:17.609
THAT ISSUE. I REMEMBER WHEN WE

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.011
HAVE ALEX LEAVER. SITUATION

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.280
WITH- PEOPLE OUT OF ONE OF THE

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.849
FACILITIES A FEW YEARS AGO. SO

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.419
NOW WE HAVE THE VIRUS. AND IF

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:29.487
THE VIRUS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL.

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:34.359
MAY BE. FOR THE SAFETY OF THE

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.660
EMPLOYEES AND THE INMATES THAT

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.329
ARE IN THEIR FACILITY IN THEIR

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.097
BOOKS ARE RESPONSIBILITIES WE

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:42.734
CARE ABOUT- IN TERMS OF THEIR

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:44.769
HEALTH ONCE THEY'RE

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:47.105
INCARCERATED THEY HAVE TO BE.

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:49.541
CHARTER HEALTH. AND ARE. AREN'T

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:52.944
A COURT ORDER. WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:58.249
SURE THERE'S- SO MAYBE MAYBE-

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.685
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO MAYBE-

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:02.721
ACCELERATE THE DISCUSSION OF

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.190
THAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WITH

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.425
THIS IN THAT FACILITY WHAT

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.060
PERCENTAGE. AND THEN THE

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.795
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH TESTING IS

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:12.163
BEING DONE IN THE IN THE

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.965
CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT. IS

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:15.433
THERE ANY NUMBERS ON CREEK

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.569
TESTING I MEAN IF YOU HAVE SO

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.070
IF YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.506
THAT HAVE THE VIRUS ARE THERE

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:23.341
ARE THERE ARE THERE NUMBER. ON

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:32.650
WHETHER OR NOT. TO PUT PEOPLE

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:34.719
IN DANGER SO WE HAVE TO KNOW

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:40.992
SOME ANSWERS. AND THEN WHEN WE

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.294
TALK ABOUT CLOSING. WHAT IS THE

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:46.631
COST OF RESPOND TO THE VIRUS

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.166
DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:51.536
THE VIRUS PLUS THE COST IS THE

TREE BETWEEN SO IN I WOULD

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.405
INTERPRET AS NOT ONLY NOT

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:44.141
TRANSFER BETWEEN STATE FACILITY

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.244

ALSO COUNTY FACILITY TO STATE

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:51.148
FACILITY BECAUSE EVERY MOVE.

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.817
ACE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF THE

00:35:52.884 --> 00:36:00.324

IN ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE. AND SO

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:33.724
I THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE THE

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:35.426

AND THEN PEOPLE ARE BEING

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:44.462
RELEASED- AND IF WE HAVEN'T

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.297
TESTED THESE PEOPLE WE DON'T

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:49.166
KNOW. EXCEPT THERE CARRYING THE

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:53.537
VIRUS. MY SAID WOULD BE TO

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:56.874
DEVISE SOME WAY OF. INCREASING

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.275
OURS SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO IT

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.545
INCREASED- BY YOU KNOW EXPEDITE

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.447
AND INCREASE THE TESTING AND

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:06.517
TRACING OF THE ARRESTS COMING

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.419
FROM THE FACILITIES. AT LEAST

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.388
TRY TO CONTAIN AT SOME POINT

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:11.722
AND THEN PRESENT US WITH THE

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.592
PLAN. WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN SO

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:17.128
THAT'S I THINK WE HAVE A MORAL

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.030
COMPUNCTION TO DO THAT I MEAN

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:22.199
IT'S THE SORT OF. AT A GIVEN

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.969
EVIDENCE THAT WE NOW HAVE. OVER

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:27.571
A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT'S- AND

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:31.509

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:32.843
RESPONSIBILITY AS JUST THE YOU

TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.816
THINGS HERE BUT I THINK THAT'S

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.951
THE BIGGER PICTURE. AT THIS

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.521
POINT GIVEN THAT WERE SUPPOSED

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.157
TO WORK NOW ON THE IMPACTS OF

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.626
THE VIRUS. AND THIS IS THE

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:49.960
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST FACTOR

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:53.130
THANK. I DON'T WANT TO SEAL YOU

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:55.299

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.201
KIND OF SITUATION THAT WOULD BE

00:38:57.268 --> 00:39:00.137
THAT DUE TO ANYTHING THAT WE DO

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:02.673
SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO KNOW

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.409
WHAT WE CAN DO AND DO OUR BEST

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:05.910

GENERAL A LOT OF ANSWER AROUND

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.657
WHAT WILL BE NEEDED SUPPORT THE

POP THE POPULATION. THAT WE CAN

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:34.198
SEE ARE GIVEN THAT THERE'S SO

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.600
MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. THE

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:37.468
ACTIONS OF THE STATE WILL TAKE

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.703
IN A FEW REGARDING CO IN

NINETEEN FOR. THE TENSION LEE

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:45.276
MADE. ANY JAILING. FOR A LOT OF

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.745
TIME WHICH WOULD REDUCE

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.147
POPULATION ON THE OTHER THERE

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:53.350
COULD BE OUT. OF FOR SO. OF

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:56.153
READ OF MANY THE RESULT PRO.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.090
THAT COULD INCREASE. AND FOR IF

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.960
MADE ARE NOT I MEAN CREDITS AT

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:06.931
THE SAME. THEY WERE UP WASTE.

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:11.969
SO. BUT THAT BUDGET BILL

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:14.305
LANGUAGE DIRECTING CDC ARE TO

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.840
PROVIDE POPULATION AND FISCAL.

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:18.309
PROJECTIONS BY OCTOBER FIRST OF

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.544
TWENTY TWENTY- THAT REFLECT THE

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.112
IMPACT OF CO IN NINETEEN AS

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:24.882
WELL AS- ON ON THE POPULATIONS

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.785
AND- THAT FISCAL IMPACTS OF

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:29.787
THAT AS WELL. AND THIS WOULD

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:30.721
GIVE THE BUT FOR THE

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.556
OPPORTUNITY. TO ASSESS WHETHER

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:35.392
IT RE DIRECT POP. IN FACT EACH

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:37.528
OTHER OR GOING TO NEED TO

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.797
AUGMENT POPULATION RELATED

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:40.931
FUNDING. AND THEN THERE WERE

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:43.500
COUPLE OTHER OTHER ITEMS ON THE

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:46.470
TRIGGER. I LESS THAT ARE MY

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:47.905
MYSELF MY COLLEAGUES DID HAVE

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.673
COMMON SIGN I'M NOT SURE IF YOU

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.242
LIKE US TO OFFER THOSE COMMENTS

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:54.311
NOW OR LATER YOU MAY OFFER NO.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.680
OKAY I'M ON THE ADULT REENTRY

00:41:56.747 --> 00:41:58.382
KEEP ON REENTRY GRANT WE DIDN'T

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.584
HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.820
BUT CHEN WOULD JUST NOTE THAT-

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:05.856
IN THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND IN

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.258
THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:10.561
WAIT COURSE. AND THEN ON THE

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.796
COMMISSION CAN'T. CONSOLIDATION

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:14.632
PROPOSAL WE DO RECOMMEND

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:18.002
APPROVING BUT- GIVEN THAT THAT

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:21.505
PROPOSAL WOULD REDUCE. THAT

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.107
WOULD REDUCE THE CAPACITY OF

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.708
CAMPS BY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:26.043
INMATES AND THERE'S CURRENTLY

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.380
MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:29.947
VACANCIES I'M IN THE CAMP SO

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:30.881
REDUCE. BUT AS A WAY TO IN

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:33.150
OTHER WORDS CREATE. WITHOUT

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.285
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INMATES

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:38.856
IN THE CAMPS. BUT WE DO

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:40.524
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.992
CONSIDERED DIRECTING THAT

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:43.460
PARCHMENT TO INCREASE THE CAN'T

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:47.298
POPULATION THROUGH. INCREASING

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.600
ANY INCENTIVES OR- CHANGING IN

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.735
MAINE ELIGIBILITY. TO THE

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:53.304
EXTENT THE STATE IS ABLE TO DO

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.272
THAT- IT COULD INCREASE THE

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.508
CAMP POPULATION- AND REACTIVATE

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:58.475
SUMMER ALL OF THOSE

00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.444
CONSOLIDATED CAMPS I'M WHICH

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.546
COULD REDUCE STATE COSTS SUCH

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:05.382
AS WILDFIRE COSTS. I'M AND THEN

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:08.552
IN MY CAR I NEED A LEVY HAS A

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:12.656
COMMENT AS WELL. SIR CAN THE

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:19.129
HERE FROM THE NEED TO LEAVE. GO

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.698
AHEAD I NEED ONLY WITH THE

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.299
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE A

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:24.535
COUPLE COPIES. XIN RELATED TO

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:26.904
ADD TO THE JUDICIARY- IT REALLY

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:30.274
HAS THREE PIECES AND- WHATEVER

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.276
AMOUNT IS FINALLY DECIDED ON.

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:33.744
WE DO RECOMMEND BUDGET THE

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:37.181
LANGUAGE- IN ONE CASE RELATED

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:37.948
TO THE TRIAL COURT

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:40.651
SPECIFICALLY- AT MINIMUM WE DO

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.319
RECOMMEND THAT THE REDUCTIONS

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:43.487
THE ALLOCATED BASED ON

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.856
WORKLOAD. TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.358
THAT ARE COMPARATIVELY LESS

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:48.926
WELL FUNDED ON A WORK WOULD BE

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:49.893
SINCE RECEIVE A SMALLER SHARE

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.996
OF THE REDUCTION LEGISLATION

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:55.065
ALSO HAS A FINE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.934
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WOULD

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.168
LIKE. IT IS NOT SUCH AS

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:00.004
INSURING CERTAIN SOME HOLES ARE

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.272
MATCHED. FOR THE REDUCTIONS TO

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:03.774
THE STATE LEVEL JUDICIARY ANY

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.809
OTHER JUDICIAL BRANCH PROGRAMS

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.111
THE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED ON A

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.213
PRO RATA BASIS AND THE

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:11.148
LEGISLATION MIGHT WANT TO

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:13.050
CONSIDER- CHANGING THOSE

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.952
ALLOCATE AND- THERE ARE D. DOT

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:16.954
SO FOR YOU. BLOG WOULD USUALLY

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.822
COUNT WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:20.824
SERVICES- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.926
WANT TO CONSIDER GIVING THE

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:24.762
SUPREME COURT IN THE COURTS OF

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.363
APPEAL A SMALLER SHARE OF THE

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.564
REDUCTION TO ENSURE PUBLIC

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:30.834
ACCESS. SERVICE IT'S- I

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.469
ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.304
THAT BUT WHEN I READ THE

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:38.842
ALEJO'S COMMENT. BECAUSE FI.

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.210
THIS IS TO LONG AGENT I DON'T

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.845
HAVE TO LEAF THROUGH IT ALL BUT

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:45.282
MY MEMORY SERVES ME WITHIN THE

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:49.987
PERCENT CUT TO TRIAL COURTS WAS

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:52.356
EQUAL TO THE PERCENT CUT TO

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:54.258
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE SUPREME

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:56.593
COURT OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SHOP

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.595
THREE DIFFERENT JUST AN BUT YOU

00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:03.534
SAY. AS WE MIGHT WANT TO. GIVE

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.103
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE- A

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.639
SUPREME COURT- T FIRST A LOWER

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.674
CUT TO GIVE ACCESS THE COURTS

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:13.544
ARE I WONDERED WHO DON'T THE

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.280
TRIAL COURT'S OR DATE. AS MUCH

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:18.549
SKINNER. INTERFACING SAID YES

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:21.885
SO I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHAT

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.954
IT WHERE YOUR DISTINCTION IS

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:29.059
THAT. THE COURTS- SPRING COURT

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:33.897
JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAVE MY LOOK.

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:36.100
I NEARLY AGAIN- WE ACTUALLY

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.267
RECOGNIZE AS I THINK THE CUT

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:39.670
SHOULD REFLECT THE PRIORITIES

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:41.605
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:42.406
COULD INCLUDE SHIFTING

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.975
REDUCTIONS BETWEEN TRIAL COURT.

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:47.044
THE SENATE JUDICIARY- OTHER THE

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:49.346
OR THE OTHER USUAL RAN WRAPS UP

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:52.049
SO HOW DOES ONE OF THE REASONS

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.918
WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE CUTS TO

00:45:54.985 --> 00:46:00.090
THE TRIAL COURT'S WE WANT ABOUT

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:02.693
WHAT WILL SERVE. FOR OTHER

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:06.096
REQUIRE. A LOT YOUR TIME LEVEL

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:07.297
OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.165
TO KIND OF MEET THAT

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:09.700
EXPECTATION AND SO THAT

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.135
CERTAINLY CAN BE- SOMETHING

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.670
THAT THE NUMBERS ARE TO REFLECT

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:17.241
THAT. AND THEN- I SEE THE

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.143
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTED TO

THERE- THERE. THEY'RE BEING

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:40.737
HELD IN COMMUNITY THEY WANTED

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.372
THEM CLOSER TO HOME THEY FELT

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.207
THAT WHAT THEY WERE EXPRESSED

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:47.077
IS THAT THEY WOULD BE CLOSER TO

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:49.612
THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES AS- AND-

00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:51.147
THEY WOULD. REPORT THREE

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:54.150
INTEGRATED ONCE THE HEAD OF A-

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:57.020
OF THEIR- SENTENCE IN SUCH AND

00:55:57.087 --> 00:56:00.223
SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT NOW.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.092
AND I'M ASSUMING PART OF THIS

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.828
IS DUE TO- YOU KNOW BUDGET

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:08.698
THREE ON THINKING. THAT BY THIS

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:12.569
SHIFT WHAT MAY NOT COME. DOES

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.037
THAT IT'S ONE IT IS CLOSER WHAT

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:19.142
IT IS IT IS HOLDING THE A DOES

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.312
TO GET INTO OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:24.681
CLOSER TO HOME. AND I THINK THE

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:26.649
OTHER THING THAT MANY OF THEM

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.551
POINTED OUT CNET WE HAD REPORT

00:56:28.618 --> 00:56:32.288
ON IS THE FACT. SOME YEARS BACK

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:34.357
THE STATE ASSISTED COUNTIES

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.793
AND- WE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.162
IN THEM TO EXPAND. THEIR COUNTY

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.931
JUVENILE FACILITIES AND THAT WE

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.300
WERE FACING IT LAST YEAR THIS

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:47.203
YEAR A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.372
YOUTH IN COUNTY FACILITY WE'RE

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.474
HAVE HUGE THE SAUDIS WITH VERY

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.443
FEW PEOPLE. AND THUS THE COST

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:57.947
PER YOUTH WAS EXPLORED.

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.816
POTENTIALLY HIGH BECAUSE THE

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:03.019
FACILITIES. IN MAINE IN

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.321
REGARDLESS MANY FOR IT. SO FOR

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.589
EXAMPLE WAS A REPORT IN AND

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:07.590
MORE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.659
THAT SHOWED I THINK THIS COUNTY

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:12.829
SANTA CLEAR SPENDING SOME FIVE

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:13.363
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:17.267
YOUTH. OTHER COUNTIES THREE IN

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:17.834
TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND WHAT

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:20.804
PEOPLE WERE UPSET BY THE FACT

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:21.337
THAT IN THE STATE WE SPEND

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:23.740
ABOUT. I THINK IT'S RUN ORDER

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:25.408
EARN FIFTY K. FOR YOU WITHIN

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:26.576
THE STATE FACILITIES THE COUNTY

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:28.311
COSTS WERE MUCH HIGHER. SO I

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:32.182
REACHED THAT BECAUSE WHILE THIS

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.683
COULD BE AND I THINK IT'S

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.819
ANTICIPATED TO BE. A WAY TO

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:38.421
ACHIEVE SOME SAVINGS IF THE

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:44.127
COUNTIES. CONTINUE TO SPEND

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:44.694
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:45.662
ARE ALL. ONE THE U. THAT WE

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.330
WOULD NOT ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:49.599
NOW I APPRECIATE THAT. PART OF

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:52.569
THE ITEM THE SECOND ITEM IS

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.337
THAT THERE WOULD BE GRANTS TO

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.740
COUNTIES BUT I THINK THAT WHAT.

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.642
WHAT I THINK MANY OF US WOULD

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.444
LIKE TO SEE IT MORE TIME TO

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.479
TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS IN

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:07.283
TRAILER. THAT WOULD ALLOW. SURE

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.186
THAT THE REHABILITATIVE AND

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:11.821
PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVES ARE

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:13.623
ACHIEVED BY THIS MOVE BUT ALSO

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.859
WE CHIEF THE COST CONTAINMENT

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:18.695
WE DO NOT WANT TO BE PENNY WISE

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:22.065
POUND FOOLISH BUT WE CERTAINLY

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.067
DON'T WANT TO SEE US GO OUT SO

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.402
I WAS AMONG THE ISSUE THAT

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.271
WOULD NEED TO STILL BE

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:32.108
DISCUSSED. IN THE IN IN FOR BUT

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.443
ON SUCH AN ACTION CENTER

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:38.114
MOORLACH Q. MINIATURE MOVING.

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.551
THE SIEGE IN ADULTS TO HHS WAS

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.854
IT WAS A PRETTY BIG. DEAL LAST

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:46.656
YEAR AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE LIKE

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:47.624
A KIND OF A WHIPLASH LIKE ALL

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:52.295
OF A SUDDEN. THE ABOUT FACE

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:56.299
KIND OF MOVE SO. I DON'T KNOW.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.800
IF IT'S A LACK OF VISION OR

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.135
LACK OF FOLLOW THROUGH OR LACK

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:03.306
OF MONEY- BUT IF IT WAS GOOD

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:04.574
LAST YEAR WERE NOT GOOD THIS

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:07.877
YEAR AND SO I GUESS THE

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.812
QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS.

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.948
MOVING THE- INDIVIDUALS NOW TO

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:13.416
THE COUNTIES IS JUST ANOTHER

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.852
FORM REALIGNMENT. AND COUNTIES

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:18.221
ARE STRUGGLING TO SO HOW HOW IS

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:23.159
THIS GOING TO. A WORK OUT. WITH

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:24.661
WITH THEIR FINANCES AND I

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.163
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM C. SACK FOR.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.731
TO PREVENT THIS SITUATION. OR

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:32.302
THE REST THE BECAUSE WE'RE JUST

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:33.403
SORT OF GET THIS LAST NIGHT SO

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:36.406
THAT SO JUST AND REACT TO A

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:39.142
MANAGER AND MAYBE- DEPARTMENT

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:42.512
FINDING IT. BY LITTLE THERE IF

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:46.115
OF THE- HISTORY OF THE THINKING

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:48.017
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A BIG

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:52.288
BOLD THE LAST YEAR. NOW TO YANK

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:56.025
IT IT JUST SEEMS. I JUST LOVE

00:59:56.092 --> 01:00:01.731
TO HEAR THE STORY. AT CENTER

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:02.865
ROAD DID YOU WANNA MAKE GOING.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:06.970
THE BOY. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.738
DID I DID SOME LEGISLATION ON

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:14.844
THIS AND. THE ADMINISTRATION OF

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:18.548
RUN FINANCE OPPOSE THE BILL- IN

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:21.884
A DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT.

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:26.289
COUNTIES WERE ACTUALLY SENDING.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:30.193
JUNE DOES FOR LOWER LEVEL. THE

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:33.963
FENCES TO THE STATE AND WE WERE

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.598
SPENDING THE MONEY TO CARE FOR

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.000
THEM IN THE COUNTIES WHERE

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.568
SPENDING ANY MONEY WE NEVER

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.405
CHARGE THE COUNTY. SO WE

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:47.243
CALCULATED THAT MAY BE. 25230%

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.545
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.948
STATE FACILITIES. PROBABLY

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.317
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CARE FOR THE

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.318
COUNTY FOR THE FACILITIES BASED

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:58.788
ON THEIR OFFENSES AND IT WAS

01:00:58.855 --> 01:00:59.355
VERY INTERESTING TO COMPARE

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:02.258
COUNTIES OF SOME OF THE LARGEST

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:07.830
COUNTIES- AND VERY FOR. PEOPLE

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.432
TO THE STATE FIRST SOME OF THE

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.434
SMALLER COUNTY SAN AT THE A

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:15.671
DISPROPORTIONATE. NUMBER OF

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.240
YOU'VE TO THE STATE FACILITIES

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:21.611
SO HE'S COUNTY. HAD A DIFFERENT

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.781
APPROACH SOME COUNTIES LIKE TO

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.716
SEND YOU KNOW SOME COUNTIES AND

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:27.884
THE JUDGES THERE ARE LIKE TO

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.285
SEND PEOPLE TO THE STATE SOME

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.522
COUNTIES DIDN'T BUT- WHEN YOU

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:37.360
SEE THAT KIND OF THING YOU YOU

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:41.097
THINK WELL THERE'S SOME.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.533
DISSIDENTS AND THE WAY WE

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:47.003
MANAGE OUT. THERE ARE NO. I'M

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.204
KIND OF INTERESTED THE FACT

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.240
THAT THERE ARE NOW. DEVELOPING

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:57.213
A REALIGNMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.482
TO GIVE THE COUNTIES A HUNDRED

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:04.487
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.557
AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:11.828
DOLLARS FOR ANNUAL PAYMENT. IN

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.996
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.132
20% OF THE USE CURRENTLY HOUSE

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.667
IN THE STATE JUVENILE

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.502
FACILITIES ARE SIGNIFICANT SEX

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.737
OFFENDER TREATMENT. FOR MENTAL

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:25.174
HEALTH A- SO THEY'RE SAYING IS

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.642
OKAY WE'RE GONNA GET MONEY FOR

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.211
THESE ARE SERIOUS OFFENDERS BUT

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:32.915
WERE. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.617
ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:37.053
THE STATE FACILITIES. THAT WE

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.522
SHOULD HAVE THIS SHOULD BE IN

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.290
THE COUNTY FACILITIES. I LIKE

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.826
TO POINT OUT FOR MY STEAM

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:44.694
CENTER FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.329
ORANGE COUNTY HIT SINCE VERY

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:50.833
FEW. VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE TO

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.002
THE STATE FACILITIES. MUCH

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.737
THERE ACTUALLY ARE LOWER THAN

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.772
MOST OF THE LARGE COUNTIES IN

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:57.707
CALIFORNIA I THINK THEY'RE THE

01:02:57.773 --> 01:03:00.910
LOWEST FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE THEY

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.044
HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS AND

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.547
THEY- TAKE CARE. IN THE MOST

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:08.184
SERIOUS OFFENDERS. SO I THINK

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.153
THIS NEEDS TO BE SQUARED UP AND

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:14.857
SQUARED AWAY. AS PART OF THE US

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:17.226
AND WE'RE WE'RE BEING ASKED TO-

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:19.962
ALLOCATE MONEY FOR THIS OKAY

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:22.598
THAT'S WHY THIS IS A VERY

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.700
COSTLY WHATEVER WE DO. WE HAVE

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:26.068
TO I THINK DETERMINE SOME

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.971
STRICT GUIDELINES ON HOW AND

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:31.007
ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT WE'RE

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.876
WE'RE SERVE EVEN HANDED ABOUT

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:37.580
THAT'S GONNA PUT BY. ARM WE

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.648
ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH THE

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.816
ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR THEY

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.285
DID NOT- SICK WE DID NOT

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.287
SUCCEED BUT NOW THEY'RE COMING

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.923
BACK WITH THIS PROPOSAL. I

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.324
THINK THERE TO BE SOME

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.027
ACCOUNTABILITY. A RELATIVE TO

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.830
THE NEXT SECTION TWENTY. I

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:55.498
THINK THE BORDER COMMUNITY

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.433
CORRECTIONS ISSUE WE RISK GOT

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.536
AN AUTO. THERE IF YOU READ THE

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:04.473
AUDIT I DID I GOT THE AUDIT- ON

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.107
THE BORDER COMMUNITY

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.375
CORRECTIONS AND THEIR

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:11.914
IMPLEMENTATION OF. THE JG CPA

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.517
AND THEY SAID THE- OVERSIGHT IS

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:19.789
WEAK. AND OF THE LOCAL CORD AND

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.592
COUNCILS OR DOING THINGS

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:26.329
DIFFERENTLY IN EACH COUNTY KIND

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:26.862
OF JUST WHAT I JUST TALKED

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:34.770
ABOUT. IT. I'M SURE I WOULD

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:37.273
PROPOSE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.609
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. OF

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.776
WE'VE MANDATE SOME

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.411
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:45.214
MEASURES FOR THE COUNTIES ON

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.450
THESE TWO PROGRAMS AND THE HAVE

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:48.551
THE BOARD OF COMMUNITY

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.354

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:29.491
PUTTING ASIDE A IN OF IN A

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.994
CAMPER FACILITY THE REAL THERE

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.163
IS REALLY NO SOME FOR THEM WE

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.231

TRAILER BILL. AND I'M SURE

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:45.708
THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:48.444
THAT WE WOULD. WANT TO PUT IN

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.080
SUCH TRAILER BILL BUT WHILE I

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.181

I STARTED READING THEM THE VICE

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.292

DIDN'T KNOW IF I SIDE ANYWAY.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.862
BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE US THE

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.296
ABILITY TO HAVE THOSE

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.632
DISCUSSIONS AND IT'S POSSIBLE

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.435
THAT. DUE TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.504
OBLIGATION FOR THE BUDGET WE

BILL. THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL BUT I

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.921

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.491
LIKE THIS WE MAY NEED MORE TIME

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:12.161

CONSIDER BILL AND THEN CENTER

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:22.071
MORE LIKE AND THEN I WANT TO

FIVE TWO. PAGE FIFTY AND IT'S

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:41.183
NOW PARAGRAPH ABOUT TO SUPPORT

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.919
THE COUNTIES. THERE WOULD BE

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:46.989
THESE THINGS INCLUDING THE

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:50.959
REGIONAL HUBS OKAY THE QUESTION

TREATMENT NEEDS. AND THE

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.348
QUESTION I HAVE IS WHY ARE THEY

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:15.083
BEING GROUPED TOGETHER IS THAT

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:18.253
WAR SHOULD THAT BE HAND OR IS

IT. IF IT'S AN ORDER IT'S NOT.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.462
PROBABLY APPROPRIATE YOU'RE NOT

PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:34.136

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:40.108
APPROPRIATE. SO CHECK. I WOULD

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:42.911

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.727
HOWEVER BECAUSE WE LAST YEAR WE

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:48.630
DECIDED TO. MOVE DAY G. D. J.

US NOT ONLY A DOLLAR CHANGE BUT

01:28:03.277 --> 01:28:08.316
A VERY SICK POLICY CHANGE SO

WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING IS THAT.

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:13.354

RELATE TO DOLLARS I THINK IS

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:36.010
MUCH MORE TO DO WITH FOR

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:38.212

INCOME TAX FILINGS AND IF THE

REVENUES GO WAY LOWER THAN

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:51.292
PROJECTED I WOULD IMAGINE. IN

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.660
PASSED FROM MY PAST EXPERIENCE

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:56.297

WITHIN THIS DISCUSS ART. FIVE

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:51.986
THE. THE OTHER ONE THE REPORT

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.655
FOR DISCUSSION WAS THE-

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:59.427
RECOMMENDATION THE MAY REVISE

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:03.798
FOR. THE CAP ON PAROLE WHICH IS

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:07.769
WOULD. PROVIDE US SOME SAVINGS

REDUCTIONS AND- ON. I WAS- I

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.511
WELCOME TO THIS PROPOSAL

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:21.215
BECAUSE THE

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.451
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BOTH

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.286
SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA'S ACROSS

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.889
THE US SHOWS THAT FOR MOST

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:29.624
PAROLEES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IS

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:33.661
ALL THAT'S REALLY NEEDED FOR-

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:36.564
FOR THAT SUPERVISION AND THAT.

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:41.769
THOSE WHO- WHO HAVE NOT MADE

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:42.637
MODIFICATIONS THEIR CRIMINAL

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:45.139
BEHAVIOR DEMONSTRATE THAT

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.809
BEFORE- TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:48.843
WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR MONTH

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:54.215
PERIOD- SO THE ACTUALLY GIVEN

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.184
THE TYPE OF DEFICIT WERE FACING.

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.186
I WOULD JUST COMMENT THAT FOR

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:02.990
EXAMPLE DURING THE LAST

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.592
RECESSION. SWEPT SOMETHING THAT

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.828
MANY MANY FOLKS MENDED BUT WAS

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:10.331
NOT DONE SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:12.900
ACHIEVE. THINGS THROUGH SUCH

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:15.603
CHANGE LIKE THIS BUT INSTEAD WE

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:16.304
BASICALLY ELIMINATE ALL

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:18.706
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM. THAT

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.975
WAS HOW WE GOT SOME SAVINGS

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:24.612
BACK IN LAST RECESSION IN THE-

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:25.613
WE HAVE TO SEE THAT IN.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.815
PARTICULAR MEETING THIS MAY

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:29.684
REVISED THERE'S NOT A WHOLE

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.886
SALE JUST ELIMINATION OF OUR

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.622
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I AM

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.724
AWARE HOWEVER THERE ARE LACKS

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:41.829
THAT ARE HAPPY WITH JUST

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:44.699
BECAUSE KOBE BECAUSE WE'RE- BUT

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:48.002
COME. SO RIGHT NOW BUT THE

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:51.839
REASON I WANTED TO DISCUSS IT

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:54.175
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE. THE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:55.276
LEGISLATURE HAS PUT INTO

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:59.280
STATUTE. THE ABILITY FOR UNDER

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:01.582
CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR ELDERLY

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:05.753
PAROLE MEDICAL PAROLE AND SOME

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:06.954
COMPASSIONATE RELEASE. AND AS I

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:11.492
PUT. SINCE THE STATUTES WERE

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.093
APPROVED AND THEY WERE PROVED

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.328
OVER AND IT'S BEEN AT LEAST

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:16.430
EIGHT YEARS THERE BEEN VERY

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.299
VERY FEW PEOPLE IN OUR

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:21.135
FACILITIES WHO WERE WHO HAVE

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:25.506
BEEN IT- TO ALLOW. TO USE THOSE

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:30.444
STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND WHEN I

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.947
LOOK AT THE DATA WE FOR EXAMPLE

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:34.448
HAVE AT LEAST ONE AND MAYBE

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:37.385
MORE. OF COURSE READ AN

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:39.020
INDIVIDUAL FOR NOW IN HOSPICE.

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:42.089
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE-

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:44.125
FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND EIGHT

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:47.662
HI WE ALSO HAVE SOME THAT ARE.

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:50.298
COMPLETELY INCAPACITATED IN IN

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:53.534
HOSPITAL TYPE SETTINGS AND IT

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:57.438
BE PERMANENTLY AND THE REQUIRE

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:00.474
A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF. OF

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:02.476
OUR TO PROVISION. THIS IS

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:05.212
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH AND I FIND

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:08.115
IT ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:09.917
CODED WHERE IF I WERE THE STAFF

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:13.087
I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN A

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:14.889
HOSPITAL SETTING HAVING TO PARK

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:22.029
SOMEONE. AND I SO. I FELT IT

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:24.065
WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO. FOR

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:27.234
STAFF TO LOOK AT WHAT WERE THE

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:30.137
INADEQUACIES IN THOSE STATUTES.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:33.240
THAT HAVE LED TO SO FEW

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.576
INDIVIDUALS OVER THAT PERIOD OF

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.678
TIME. BEING PROVIDED EITHER

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:43.084
IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH COSTS.

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:46.287
SO WHAT THE- IN THE C. C. OUR

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:47.922

CARBON. THEN PUT ON OF IT

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:27.314
BITTER. SEEN IS THAT WHAT THERE

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.450
ARE SOME PEOPLE WANT THEIR AND-

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:32.620
DURING. IT BY AND LARGE THE

INTO. ARE INTO BAITED. CUT THE

01:36:36.757 --> 01:36:39.960
PERCENTAGE YOUR RECOVERY DOWN.

01:36:40.027 --> 01:36:41.595
DO YOU IMAGINE BE THIS WHO HAVE

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:50.337
TO BE IN THE- IN. WORE A. IS IT

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:55.242
CHEATING WHAT WE INTENDED. SO

01:36:55.309 --> 01:37:01.248
SIR MOORLACH WITH CDC ARE. WERE

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:02.883
WERE JUST FACING NOW JUST A

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:07.688
MASSIVE. QUICK MODIFICATION TO.

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:11.425
ECONOMIC TIMES- BUT WE'RE NOT

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.860
LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC ISSUES-

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.262
ANALYZING KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:21.669
TO IMPROVE. ENTIRE SYSTEM. THE

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:25.506
LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE AS A

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.140
LEGISLATIVE BODY APPROVED BILLS

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:28.943
THAT. PROHIBITS THE USE PRIVATE

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:33.981
PRISONS COMPLETELY. MAYBE IN

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:37.151
GOOD TIMES THAT'S OKAY. BUT IN

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:39.186
TOUGH TIMES THE PRICE

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:41.455
DIFFERENTIAL PER YEAR OF WHAT

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.024
IT TAKES TO. HOUSE IN IN MADE A

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:46.160
STATE PRISON VERSUS A PRIVATE

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:50.097
FACILITY. HIS RATHER DRAMATIC.

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.932
ALMOST FIFTY WITH FIFTY

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.667
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO IF

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:57.271
YOU WERE TO MOVE TEN THOUSAND.

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:58.572
INMATES TO PRIVATE FACILITY

01:37:58.639 --> 01:37:59.640
SHOULD SAVE A HALF A BILLION

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.176
DOLLARS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.011
HOW A DISCUSSION LIKE THAT

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:07.314
WOULD START BUT SOME OF THE

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.683
SYSTEM MAKE BRING SAID. MAYBE

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.851
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:13.320
SHOULD SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT WHAT

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:15.589
CAN WE FIX NOW. THAT WOULD

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:18.292
CARRY OVER- AN AFFRONT TO SEVEN

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:20.261
MONDAY IN THE BUDGET AND FISCAL

01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:22.730
REVIEW COMMITTEE WHAT. WHAT CAN

01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:24.732
WE DO TO NEGOTIATE DOWN RETIREE

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.867
MEDICAL. WHEN I WAS A

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:29.570
SUPERVISOR WHO WE NEGOTIATED

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.038
WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS AND

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.339
WE REDUCED OUR IN FRONT OF

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:34.208
LIABILITY BY 71% THEY AGREED TO

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:36.910
IT. WE DID THAT HERE AT THE

01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:38.012
STATE LEVEL THAT WE'RE PROBABLY

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:40.080
TALKING SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:43.717
WE COULD REDUCE. AND THAT WOULD

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:44.551
FREE UP A LOT OF MONEY FOR.

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:50.591
SCHOOL YOU SEE AN- SYSTEM AND

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.493
YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU KNOW SOMEHOW

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:55.296
SOMEWHERE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:56.897
OF FINANCE A LOOK AT WHAT CAN

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:59.633
WE DO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.835
THAT WILL HELP US IN THE FUTURE

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:03.671
THE PENSION PLAN WILL COME BACK

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.773
IN HIS HEART AND TWO OR THREE

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:07.708
YEARS. THE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:10.377
AT THIS VICE GRIP THAT'S COMMON

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:12.079
YOU KNOW AND SO I JUST REGULAR

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:16.216
MANAGER JUST AS WE LOOK AT HOW

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:18.652
WE RUN CALIFORNIA'S AS COMPARED

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:21.722
TO THE OTHER OTHER PRACTICES IN

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:25.426
A WHERE CAN WE TAKE A HARD LOOK

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:28.162
AND MAKE SOME. CHANGES TO

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:31.098
REALLY FIX SOME STE. BEING AS A

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.233
AS COULD BE. THANK YOU FOR

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.702
LETTING ME BROACH THAT SUBJECT

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:38.906
CERTAINLY. SO THE- FINAL ITEM

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:41.642
ON THIS PART OF OUR DISCUSSION

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.678
WAS- AGAIN WHEN I PULLED FOR

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:47.348
DISCUSSION WHICH IS THE THAT A

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:49.183
REVISION. BUT HAS SOME

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:51.819
RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:53.887
GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT EARNINGS

01:39:53.954 --> 01:39:57.725
AND- IT I WOULD. I WOULD

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.360
ANTICIPATE THAT PART OF THE

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.829
INTEREST THERE IS THAT IF GIVEN

01:40:01.895 --> 01:40:03.664
THAT THIS BUDGET IS PREDICATED

01:40:03.731 --> 01:40:05.532
ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.668
DESCRIBED ITS PERPETRATED ON

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:14.108
THE- ABILITY TO. CLOSE SOME OF.

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:16.176
FACILITIES WITHIN THE NEXT

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:21.014
COUPLE OF YEARS. AND CLEAR

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:22.282
THREE FIVE YEARS IF YOU IF WE

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:26.019
HAVE THE SAME POPULATION. TODAY

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.921
IF WE HAVE THE SAME POPULATION

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.289
IN THREE YEARS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:31.024
DAY THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:34.828
DIFFICULT TO CHEAT SO- SOME OF

01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:37.097
IT IS AROUND IMPROVING OUR

01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:39.366
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:42.336
GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:40:42.403 --> 01:40:42.836
THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO TAKE

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.072
ADVANTAGE. IT WENT STRAIGHT.

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:47.641
BUT THEIR SKILLS AND SAY. THAT

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.376
DISALLOWED THEM TO EARN THOSE

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:51.812
ADDITIONAL CREDITS TO EITHER

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:54.681
EARLIER TIME TO GO BEFORE THE

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.150
PROBE ORDER EARLY RELEASE. OUT

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:58.619
ON THE REASON WHEN THE PUBLIC

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:02.322
WAS FIVE I A SUPPORT IT BUT I.

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:04.291
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:07.194
LANGUAGE OF EXACTLY HOW THAT

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.696
CAN BE ACHIEVED THERE THERE

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:13.200
WILL DEBATE THING WAS THREE

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:17.438
YEARS AGO AROUND WHAT. THE WHAT

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:18.372
THINGS COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:21.074
CREDIT IT'S PROP FIFTY SEVEN IS

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:23.477
BROAD AND THERE WERE AND WHAT

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:25.546
WAS WE DID ON WAS FROM SOME

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.915
FOLKS HAVE POINT OF VIEW YOU

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:30.451
KNOW DO NOT IT WAS IT WAS A

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:34.955
RATHER. THERE WAS MORE. AND SO.

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:36.523
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:38.258
WE LOOK AT THAT TRAILER BILL

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:40.160
LANGUAGE AND AGAIN WE MAY NOT

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.729
BE ABLE TO. RESOLVE IT FULLY

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:46.633
BEFORE OUR I DO BUDGET OPTION

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.368
BUT THAT WE HAVE- A GOOD A

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:51.538
ROBUST PROCESS AROUND. WHAT

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:52.906
THINGS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:54.374
CREDIT AND WHAT ARE THE

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:55.776
CONDITIONS FOR. KING THOSE

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:59.213
CREDITS. SELF THAT WAS SEVEN

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.782
AND WE HAVE BEEN LA- COMMENT I

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.584
BELIEVE ON THIS GO AHEAD-

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:10.457
MISSONI OLD. THANK YOU I JUST A

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.859
COUPLE POINTS ON THIS ISSUE

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.361
THAT I WANTED TO RAISE- THE

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:15.929
FIRST IS A TECHNICAL BUDGETING

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.464
ISSUE AND THE SECOND IS A BIG

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.433
PICTURE ISSUE I'M ON THE

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.335
TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT THE

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:23.003
ADMINISTRATION'S CORES SOME

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.905
SAVINGS IN THAT BUDGET YEAR

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:26.273
ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.941
POPULATION REDUCTION THAT IS

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:29.510
ESTIMATED TO RESULT FROM THESE

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:32.713
CREDIT CHANGES. I'M AND THAT

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.114
DOES CHANGE. THOSE SAVINGS

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.282
DON'T ACCOUNT FOR SAVINGS AN

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:38.352
INMATE HEALTHCARE COSTS SO WE-

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:39.820
THE MEAT THAT THE SAVINGS COULD

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:41.955
BE HERE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:44.024
MILLION DOLLARS GREATER IN THE

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:45.759
BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:48.428
SECOND ISSUE IS THE BIG PICTURE

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:50.631
ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO MENTION-

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:51.965
IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:55.202
ESTIMATES THAT THE CHANGES.

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:59.439
INCORRECT ERNIE. THIS YOUR

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:01.275
FROZE WE DON'T HEAR YOU RIGHT

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.777
NOW SHE'S FROZE WHICH NAME AND

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:08.448
FORM A COUPLE. OF. RIGHT NOW

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.317
YOU'RE NOW YOU'RE SURE YOU JUST

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:11.919
NEED TO THE BLACK LITTLE IN

01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:13.720
TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE SET UP ON

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:17.391
OKAY. GREAT SORRY ABOUT THAT-

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:21.595
SO IRATE DID YOU HEAR ME

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.363
DISCUSS THE ONE POINT TWO

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.964
MILLION AND ADDITIONAL STEPS.

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:26.967
YES OKAY. GREAT AND SO THEN

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:27.968
MOVING ON TO THE BIG PICTURE

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:30.537
ISSUE WHICH IS THAT- BE

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:31.939
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.140
THAT POPULATION REDUCTION

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:35.842
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE- CHANGES

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:38.679
TO GOOD CONDUCT CREDIT EARNING-

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:42.482
RATES WOULD REDUCE. IRAN NINETY

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.851
HUNDRED INMATES IN THREE TWENTY

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:46.253
FOUR WHICH IF YOU COMBINE THAT

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.121
WITH THAT PROPOSED CHANGES TO

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.489
RECEPTION CENTER PROCESS THESE

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.391
WHICH WOULD ALSO REDUCE. GEN

01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:54.628
WE'D BE LOOKING AT A ROUGHLY

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:55.095
ELEVEN THOUSAND INMATE

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:58.131
REDUCTION BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:58.732
THREE TWENTY FOUR IN ADDITION

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.200
TO THE ON GOING DECLINE IN THE

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.768
POPULATION THAT JUST IN CASE

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:06.073
FIND TREND- AND SO. THIS DATA

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:06.873
LEVIN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:09.476
DECLINE WOULD ALLOW FOR FURTHER

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:11.345
PRISON CLOSURES BEYOND IT TO

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:12.946
THAT THE GOVERNOR- HAS

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:14.781
INDICATED HE WOULD CALL. I'M

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:18.018
AND SO THIS COULD CHANGE THE

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:18.552
COMPOSITION OF THE INMATE

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:20.387
POPULATION. AND FOR HER AND

THAT IT'S EQUALLY APPLIED FOR

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:08.868

ADDITIONALLY INDIRECTLY SAVE

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:39.666
US. MONEY AND IT WOULD BE

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:42.402
EASIER FOR THE STAFF TO OPERATE

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:46.473

SELF WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM

01:54:31.164 --> 01:54:34.701
ONE EIGHTEEN. AND THAT ITEM IS-

01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:40.039
pBRANCH AND IT WAS SOMETHING

01:54:40.106 --> 01:54:43.009
THAT WAS APPROVED. IN THE PAST

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:46.112

WHICH I THINK IN PRINCIPLE AS

01:55:21.881 --> 01:55:25.018
MUCH AS I AM HESITANT TO

01:55:25.084 --> 01:55:26.486
AUTHORIZE ANY NEW GENERAL FUND

LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:49.936
PROPOSAL- IN THIS IS BECAUSE

STILL UNCERTAIN BECAUSE IT'S A

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:12.358
PILOT. AND IT COULD REQUIRE

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:14.660
MORE PAYING THEM. AND IT'S ALSO

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:16.796
PREMATURE TO EXPAND THE TOLD

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:18.564

PROPOSAL SH IT'S FOR A LITTLE

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:28.074
BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THAT.

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:29.842
THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER THE

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:34.914
COMPONENTS AND THE OTHER

01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:36.549
ACTIVITIES THAT WERE SUPPOSED

01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:38.951
TO BE TESTED ARE NOT GOING TO

01:57:39.018 --> 01:57:40.720
BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE END OF

TWENTY- AND- TWENTY. THERE'S

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:46.492
REALLY BLACK TWENTY EIGHT OF

COURT USERS ALSO ALL THE

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:57.670
IMPACTS. HAVE UPON THE VARIOUS

01:57:57.737 --> 01:58:01.007
STATE LOCAL FINDS. BY THE CAR.

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.909
AND THE TAX THAT IS INCLUDE FOR

01:58:02.975 --> 01:58:04.577
THAT TRIAL COURTS OVER THE

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:05.545
DIGITAL RASH COULD ACTUALLY BE

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:06.846
HIGHER THAN WHAT CURRENTLY

01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:09.649
IDENTIFY WE JUST WANTED TO PUT

01:58:09.715 --> 01:58:11.184

YOU. I APPRECIATE. ARI EXPECTED

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:17.990
BECAUSE I DID READ THAT COMMENT

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:20.426
BY THE LA- AND IT MAY BE

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:23.362
APPROPRIATE TO POTENTIALLY

01:58:23.429 --> 01:58:25.097
LIMIT THE EXPANSION DEPENDING

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:28.167
ON- WHAT MORE WE MAY LEARN

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:29.535
AROUND CERTAIN OF THE COURTS.

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.204
BUT I THINK TO ELIMINATE IT

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:32.505
RIGHT NOW AT THE POINT WHERE WE

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:35.575
HAVE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:36.409
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE INABILITY

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:39.846
TO PAY- DOES NOT MAKE A LOT OF

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:42.582
SENSE TO ME SO. BUT CLEARLY

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.417
WILL HAVE THEIR SOME DETAILS

01:58:44.484 --> 01:58:47.186
THAT STILL HAVE TO BE. WORKED

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:48.988
OUT DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:57.096
COMMENTS. OKAY THN WE WILL

01:58:57.163 --> 01:59:01.968
MOVE ON TO THE- NEXT ITEM WHICH

01:59:02.034 --> 01:59:05.972
IS DOJ DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:13.079
AND THAT IS ON. THERE IS A- TWO

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:17.483
ISSUES IN DOJ THAT WERE RELATED

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:19.151
TO THE- TESTING OF SEXUAL

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:22.054
EVIDENCE. THERE WAS ONE THAT

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:31.197
WAS. IS NEW MONEY NEW MONEY TO

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:34.700
IMPLEMENT SB TWENTY TWO WHICH

01:59:34.767 --> 01:59:38.471
ARE. BASICALLY HAS SOME NEW

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:41.807
REQUIREMENTS AROUND THIS THE

01:59:41.874 --> 01:59:44.477
TESTING OF SEXUAL EVIDENCE- BUT

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:47.513
THEN THERE IS THE SECOND ITEM

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:50.750
WHICH IS A RE VERSION OF-

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.485
MONIES THAT WERE APPROVED IN

01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:54.687
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:57.156
HELP THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:59.759
HAVE A BIG BACKLOG. SO I FOUND

01:59:59.825 --> 02:00:01.727
IT INTERESTING ON THE HAND YES

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:03.529
IT IS TRUE WE HAVE A GENERAL

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:05.164
FUND DEFICIT AND CERTAINLY WE

02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:07.166
NEED LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES COST

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:08.801
SAVINGS BUT THAT WE WOULD BE

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:10.736
DIVERSITY. ONE DOLLAR AMOUNT

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:13.940
THAT HELPED US INSURER. THE

02:00:14.006 --> 02:00:16.275
TESTING OF THE THIS SEXUAL

02:00:16.342 --> 02:00:18.144
EVIDENCE AND YET WE WOULD BE

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:20.846
THAT FINDING ANOTHER ACTIVITY

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:22.381
THAT MIGHT HELP SO THEY SEEM TO

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:22.915
I MEAN I WOULDN'T CALL IT

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:26.018
CONTRA THREE BUT CERTAINLY- TWO

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:32.158
MILLION. IT WILL NOT WIN THE

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:33.859
KIND OF DEFICIT WE HAVE ANY

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:35.895
DOLLAR AMOUNT WE CAN SAVE IS

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:39.332
IMPORTANT BUT I KNOW THAT THE-

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:40.566
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD

02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:43.903
ALREADY PUT OUT IN OR IF P. AND

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:45.371

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:47.573
SHOWING SOME JURISDICTIONS WITH

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.575
VERY SIGNIFICANT BACK LOADS AND

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:51.210
I WOULD EXPECT AND I CERTAINLY

02:00:51.277 --> 02:00:53.713
HOPE THAT THOSE JURISDICTIONS

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:58.851
WOULD FIND FREE GRANTS TO IT

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:01.387
THEY GOT RID OF THE DOG. AND I.

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:05.091
BUT SO I WOULD PREFER THAT THAT

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:10.396
THAT NOT BE REVERTED. AND I'M

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:11.897
HAPPY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.699
COMMENT FROM EITHER DOJ OR

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.301

ACCUMULATED QUITE A BIT MORE

03:37:44.851 --> 03:37:46.720
BORROWING FROM THEM AND I'M

03:37:46.787 --> 03:37:47.521

COSTS AND I'M JUST SORT OF

03:38:02.335 --> 03:38:04.204
CURIOUS IF I COULD MAYBE USE

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:05.939
THIS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A LOT OF

03:38:06.006 --> 03:38:08.175
THE OTHER FINE ART SO- THIS ONE

03:38:08.241 --> 03:38:09.609
WAS ON THE VOTE ON THE CALENDAR

03:38:09.676 --> 03:38:11.478
BUT WE CAN PULL IT. BECAUSE YOU

03:38:11.545 --> 03:38:13.046
HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT.

03:38:13.113 --> 03:38:15.916
HOWEVER WE MAY NOT HAVE A STAFF

03:38:15.982 --> 03:38:17.617

BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. WELL

03:38:20.854 --> 03:38:22.255
THIS ONE IS REPLACING ALONE

03:38:22.322 --> 03:38:24.324
FRONT THIRDS FROM SCHOOL LANDS

03:38:24.391 --> 03:38:27.060
AND STATE LANDS- IT MINISTERS

03:38:27.127 --> 03:38:30.430
BUT MARK HOPEFULLY YOU CAN. SO

03:38:30.497 --> 03:38:31.765
WE'RE GOING TO PULL THIS FROM

03:38:31.832 --> 03:38:33.133
VOTE ONLY AND ADDED TO THIS

03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:35.035
DISCUSSION. SO THAT OF A

03:38:35.101 --> 03:38:37.103
SENATOR MORAL CAN HAVE HIS-

03:38:37.170 --> 03:38:39.840
QUESTION ADDRESSED- DIRECTOR

03:38:39.906 --> 03:38:43.844

FINANCE- WHAT WE CAN GET BACK

03:38:57.791 --> 03:38:59.159
TO SOME OF THE DETAILS I THINK

03:38:59.226 --> 03:39:00.794
THAT THE NATURE OF THE REVENUE

03:39:00.861 --> 03:39:02.395
THAT GOES INTO THAT FUND IS A

03:39:02.462 --> 03:39:05.065
RELATED TO- AT LEAST REVENUE

03:39:05.131 --> 03:39:07.033
THAT COMES OFF OF LANDS THAT

03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:09.336
WERE USUALLY GRANT THE- STATE

03:39:09.402 --> 03:39:12.205
USERS COLIN'S AND- SO WE CAN

03:39:12.272 --> 03:39:13.139
GET BACK AND SOME OF THE

03:39:13.206 --> 03:39:14.374
DETAILS FROM THE STATE LANDS

03:39:14.441 --> 03:39:18.044
COMMISSION AS TO. HOW THAT FELT.

03:39:18.111 --> 03:39:19.012
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

03:39:19.079 --> 03:39:20.547
MEASURE BECAUSE INTERNALLY IN

03:39:20.614 --> 03:39:22.382
SECTION OUR PARTY WE- CERTAINLY

03:39:22.449 --> 03:39:23.917
WERE BORROWED FROM SOME FINDS

03:39:23.984 --> 03:39:26.586
pTHAT RATE. IN CANADA- GENERATED

03:39:26.653 --> 03:39:28.622
BY FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED SO

03:39:28.688 --> 03:39:30.390
JUST. LOOK CONCERNING HOW THEY

03:39:30.457 --> 03:39:33.760
DEVELOP CERTAIN LARGE BALANCES.

03:39:33.827 --> 03:39:35.195
PROBABLY NICE TO HAVE THEM BUT-

03:39:35.262 --> 03:39:37.264
MAYBE MAYBE A POLICY SHOULD BE

03:39:37.330 --> 03:39:38.999
REVIEWED. THANK YOU THANK YOU

03:39:39.065 --> 03:39:44.337
THANK YOU MARK. OKAY SO ON THE-

03:39:44.404 --> 03:39:46.072
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO NOTE

03:39:46.139 --> 03:39:49.609
THAT WE WILL BE. VOTING ON THAT

03:39:49.676 --> 03:39:50.143
SEPARATELY BECAUSE WE DID

03:39:50.210 --> 03:39:53.847
PODESTA DISCUSSION SO- BUT LET

03:39:53.914 --> 03:39:57.083
ME NOW TURN TO THE- PLAN TO THE

03:39:57.150 --> 03:39:58.885
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN

03:39:58.952 --> 03:40:02.322
AND THE- FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME

03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:06.226
GENERAL FUND ITEMS. AND LEE AS

03:40:06.293 --> 03:40:08.295
WE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST FIRE

03:40:08.361 --> 03:40:10.664
SEASON NET SO SHOCKED THOSE

03:40:10.730 --> 03:40:13.166
POWER SHUTDOWNS. REALLY

03:40:13.233 --> 03:40:16.202
IMPACTED- THEY IMPACTED PEOPLE

03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:19.005
MEDICALLY THE IMPACTED.

03:40:19.072 --> 03:40:21.074
EMERGENCY SERVICES THE PACK

03:40:21.141 --> 03:40:22.742
IMPACTED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO

03:40:22.809 --> 03:40:24.611
COMMUNICATE BECAUSE INTERNET

03:40:24.678 --> 03:40:26.012
WENT DOWN I MEAN THERE WERE SO

03:40:26.079 --> 03:40:28.181
MANY THINGS AND STAND. THERE IT

03:40:28.248 --> 03:40:29.983
WAS IN ELEGANT IN THAT THERE

03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:31.685
WERE- MANY COMMUNITIES THAT

03:40:31.751 --> 03:40:33.653
WERE EXPERIENCING SHUT DOWN FOR

03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:34.821
MANY MORE DAYS THAN PEOPLE

03:40:34.888 --> 03:40:36.289
MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED WE

03:40:36.356 --> 03:40:37.591
CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THEY ARE

03:40:37.657 --> 03:40:40.527
NECESSARY. IF I WITH THE HIGH

03:40:40.594 --> 03:40:42.162
WINDS CIRCUMSTANCE A HIGH WIND

03:40:42.228 --> 03:40:44.831
IN A HOT VERY HOT CONDITIONS

03:40:44.898 --> 03:40:47.300
BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO. MAKE

03:40:47.367 --> 03:40:49.302
SURE THAT WE HEAR THAT IN

03:40:49.369 --> 03:40:50.937
FIXING YOUR CRISIS WE ARE TO

03:40:51.004 --> 03:40:53.139
EXACERBATING A CRISIS SO I

03:40:53.206 --> 03:40:54.708
APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S PART OF

03:40:54.774 --> 03:40:57.143
WHAT THIS MONEY IS TRYING TO

03:40:57.210 --> 03:41:00.447
DO. SO WHILE I KNOW THAT IT IS

03:41:00.513 --> 03:41:03.216
APPROPRIATE THAT THE- SOME

03:41:03.283 --> 03:41:05.118
NUMBER THE STATE AGENCIES

03:41:05.185 --> 03:41:08.888
RECEIVE FUNDING. FIVE IF YOU

03:41:08.955 --> 03:41:09.689
KNOW FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR

03:41:09.756 --> 03:41:11.591
EXAMPLE ON THE STATE TOTALS-

03:41:11.658 --> 03:41:14.127
DURING ONE OF THE SHUTDOWNS-

03:41:14.194 --> 03:41:16.162
THE CALL THE CUT TONAL WAS

03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:18.632
CALTRANS DID. I DON'T NOT QUITE

03:41:18.698 --> 03:41:20.367
SURE WHY BUT THEY HAD TO CLOSE

03:41:20.433 --> 03:41:23.169
THE ENTIRE TUNNEL. BECAUSE THEY

03:41:23.236 --> 03:41:25.005
DIDN'T COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW

03:41:25.071 --> 03:41:26.539
TO YOU HAVE TO BE EXHAUSTED

03:41:26.606 --> 03:41:28.475
STEM OPERATE. IN THE COURSE THE

03:41:28.541 --> 03:41:30.143
DANGER OF THAT IS HAD THERE

03:41:30.210 --> 03:41:33.313
BEEN ANY FIRE- ON THE- OTHER

03:41:33.380 --> 03:41:34.381
SIDE OF THE TUNNEL WE WOULD

03:41:34.447 --> 03:41:36.616
HAVE. GIVEN THE WEIGHT THAT THE

03:41:36.683 --> 03:41:38.351
ROADS IN THAT AREA ARE HE WOULD

03:41:38.418 --> 03:41:40.687
HAVE COMPLETELY IMPEDED EITHER

03:41:40.754 --> 03:41:43.356
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET OUT.

03:41:43.423 --> 03:41:45.458
FOR SOME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO

03:41:45.525 --> 03:41:47.427
GET IN. SO WE DON'T WANT THAT

03:41:47.494 --> 03:41:49.996
TO HAPPEN SO I'D APPRECIATE

03:41:50.063 --> 03:41:51.931
THAT WE WOULD NEED POTENTIALLY

03:41:51.998 --> 03:41:53.733
SOME FUNDING THERE. BUT THERE

03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:56.670
ARE SOME DOLLAR AMOUNT HERE. I

03:41:56.736 --> 03:42:00.540
WONDER- WHETHER WE NEED ALL OF

03:42:00.607 --> 03:42:01.941
THAT TO THOSE STATE AGENCIES

03:42:02.008 --> 03:42:03.476
AND THE REASON I RAISE THAT IS

03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:04.878
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THE

03:42:04.944 --> 03:42:09.683
COUNTY ALLOCATIONS- I A LOOK AT

03:42:09.749 --> 03:42:11.685
FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW SOME OF

03:42:11.751 --> 03:42:14.621
OUR- HI. FIRE AREAS THAT WHILE

03:42:14.688 --> 03:42:15.822
THEY MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED

03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:17.891
ABOUT FIRE IN THE LAST TWO

03:42:17.957 --> 03:42:20.260
COUPLE SEASONS HISTORICALLY

03:42:20.326 --> 03:42:21.795
THEY HAVE BEEN AREAS WITH THE

03:42:21.861 --> 03:42:24.030
WORST FIRES. AND YET THERE

03:42:24.097 --> 03:42:27.233
ALLOCATION. MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE

03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:29.436
FOR THE NEED ADDITIONALLY I SEE

03:42:29.502 --> 03:42:31.438
THAT THIS IS ONLY COUNTIES AND

03:42:31.504 --> 03:42:33.606
NOT SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND IF

03:42:33.673 --> 03:42:36.176
WE TAKE AGAIN I'LL BE VERY

03:42:36.242 --> 03:42:38.144
SPECIFIC ABOUT MY DISTRICT.

03:42:38.211 --> 03:42:41.781
WHICH HAD THE WORST FIRE PRIOR

03:42:41.848 --> 03:42:44.751
TO THE SANTA ROSA AND THE-

03:42:44.818 --> 03:42:50.623
ORDER DID I SAY THAT RIGHT FOR.

03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:51.224
WHAT WAS THE COMMUNITY IN THE

03:42:51.291 --> 03:42:54.894
LAST. PARADISE NOT POOR EXCUSE

03:42:54.961 --> 03:42:57.497
ME DEAD CENTER IS IN PARADISE

03:42:57.564 --> 03:42:59.532
ENDED UP BEING WORSE THAN THE

03:42:59.599 --> 03:43:01.634
OAKLAND BERKELEY TOTAL FIRE IN

03:43:01.701 --> 03:43:03.536
TERMS OF BOTH LIVES LOST IN

03:43:03.603 --> 03:43:06.673
STRUCTURES DAMAGE AND SUCH BUT

03:43:06.740 --> 03:43:08.475
FOR A GOOD TWENTY YEARS THERE

03:43:08.541 --> 03:43:11.111
THAT THE OLD. CALL THE CARD I

03:43:11.177 --> 03:43:13.847
MEAN THE OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE

03:43:13.913 --> 03:43:14.414
WAS THE WORST IN THE STATE'S

03:43:14.481 --> 03:43:16.382
HISTORY. AND IT'S ONLY JUST A

03:43:16.449 --> 03:43:18.351
MATTER OF A WIND PATTERNS

03:43:18.418 --> 03:43:19.385
RELUCTANT WE HAVEN'T HAD

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:21.421
ANOTHER ONE THERE AND THE NEXT

03:43:21.488 --> 03:43:24.190
ONE COULD BE THAT BAD DEAR. AND

03:43:24.257 --> 03:43:26.192
IT IS THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS

03:43:26.259 --> 03:43:28.661
THAT OFFER FIRE SERVICES IN

03:43:28.728 --> 03:43:32.799
THAT AREA. SOME MUCH OF IT IS A

03:43:32.866 --> 03:43:34.534
LAND FOR EXAMPLE UNDER EAST BAY

03:43:34.601 --> 03:43:36.102
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHICH

03:43:36.169 --> 03:43:38.338
HOUSING FIRE DEPARTMENT- MUCH

03:43:38.404 --> 03:43:40.540
OF THE CELL TOWERS ARE ALSO ON

03:43:40.607 --> 03:43:42.709
THAT LAND. AND THERE'S JUST

03:43:42.776 --> 03:43:45.145
THERE ARE CERTAIN SPECIAL

03:43:45.211 --> 03:43:48.047
DISTRICTS THAT EITHER MANAGE A

03:43:48.114 --> 03:43:50.316
LOT OF LAND IN THE WE IN THE

03:43:50.383 --> 03:43:52.786
URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE. FOR

03:43:52.852 --> 03:43:55.121
THAT PROVIDE FIRE SERVICES AND

03:43:55.188 --> 03:43:58.892
SO BASS DATE THEIR ROLE IN THE

03:43:58.958 --> 03:44:00.226
IN THE POWER SHUT OFF WE WANT

03:44:00.293 --> 03:44:01.961
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- ARE

03:44:02.028 --> 03:44:03.897
ADEQUATELY PER AT OUR

03:44:03.963 --> 03:44:05.598
ADEQUATELY RESOURCE SO THAT THE

03:44:05.665 --> 03:44:07.734
POWER SHUT OFF DOES NOT IMPEDE

03:44:07.801 --> 03:44:10.303
THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE. THE

03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:11.805
EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT THEY

03:44:11.871 --> 03:44:14.040
PROVIDE SO I JUST RAISE IT

03:44:14.107 --> 03:44:15.275
BECAUSE THE WAY THIS IS

03:44:15.341 --> 03:44:17.277
STRUCTURED. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE

03:44:17.343 --> 03:44:19.045
ACCESS TO ANY OF THESE FUNDS SO

03:44:19.112 --> 03:44:20.446
I THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

03:44:20.513 --> 03:44:21.714
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE NEED TO

03:44:21.781 --> 03:44:23.850
HAVE. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

03:44:23.917 --> 03:44:25.819
TRAILER BILL IS DIRECTED

03:44:25.885 --> 03:44:28.354
TOWARDS THE HIGHEST NEED AREAS

03:44:28.421 --> 03:44:31.424
THAT ARE BOTH. THE MOST LIKELY

03:44:31.491 --> 03:44:34.394
TO EXPERIENCEWE'D HAVE ALL THE

03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:35.829
DATA THE BILL. A SERIES

03:44:35.895 --> 03:44:37.897
WILDFIRE AND THAT WILL BE MOST

03:44:37.964 --> 03:44:40.066
IMPACTED BY POWER SHUT OFFS. SO

03:44:40.133 --> 03:44:43.670
THAT. IS WHY I WOULD APPROVED

03:44:43.736 --> 03:44:46.105
THE ALLOCATION BUT WITH PLACE

03:44:46.172 --> 03:44:48.007
HOLDER TRAILER LANGUAGE SO WE

03:44:48.074 --> 03:44:51.110
CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY BEST WAY

03:44:51.177 --> 03:44:51.611
TO ALLOCATE THAT FIFTEEN

03:44:51.678 --> 03:44:56.716
MILLION. WE'RE NOT VOTING YET.

03:44:56.783 --> 03:44:58.418
END UP POLICIES FOR ALL THE

03:44:58.484 --> 03:45:01.454
COMMENTARY BUT- BY WAS IN

03:45:01.521 --> 03:45:04.958
OFFICE DURING THAT FIGHT FIRE

03:45:05.024 --> 03:45:07.193
AND- I WAS ALSO ON THE BOARD

03:45:07.260 --> 03:45:10.263
LATER ON THE BOARD OF THESE BE

03:45:10.330 --> 03:45:11.798
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHEN. UP

03:45:11.865 --> 03:45:18.238
CONFIRA KURT. I'M OKAY SO WE

03:45:18.304 --> 03:45:20.440
OTHERWISE ALL THE OTHER ITEMS

03:45:20.506 --> 03:45:22.375
EXCEPT THE ONE THAT- CENTER

03:45:22.442 --> 03:45:24.544
MORE LIKE CALDERON VOTE ONLY SO

03:45:24.611 --> 03:45:27.714
I BELIEVE- STAFF TO FIND WHAT I

03:45:27.780 --> 03:45:29.482
SEE THE LA- HAS THEIR HANDS UP

03:45:29.549 --> 03:45:31.084

COMMENT. THIRTY ONE YOUR

03:45:38.524 --> 03:45:39.993
COMMENTS I THINK GREATER WHY

03:45:40.059 --> 03:45:41.694
THIS NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING IN

03:45:41.761 --> 03:45:43.529
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET WE

03:45:43.596 --> 03:45:45.598
ARE FOCUSING ON A LOCAL

03:45:45.665 --> 03:45:47.867
ASSISTANCE IN TRYING TO ALSO

03:45:47.934 --> 03:45:49.602
OUTLINES DOING IT KIND OF A

03:45:49.669 --> 03:45:51.271
IMMEDIATE A MATCHING GRANT

03:45:51.337 --> 03:45:53.640
PROGRAM EXCEPT THAT'S AVAILABLE

03:45:53.706 --> 03:45:56.442
TO TRY AND GET FUNDING ALLOWS

03:45:56.509 --> 03:45:57.610
SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS TO

BEFORE YOUR COMMENT THANK YOU

IT'S NOT- IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT

03:46:13.426 --> 03:46:14.294
SPECIAL DISTRICTS MIGHT BE

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:15.662
ELIGIBLE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF

03:46:15.728 --> 03:46:17.096
JUST DOING IT BY COUNTY IS THAT

03:46:17.163 --> 03:46:18.665
SOME SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE

03:46:18.731 --> 03:46:20.667

FOR LETTING ME SPEAK- BRIEFLY

03:46:36.783 --> 03:46:37.850
SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

03:46:37.917 --> 03:46:39.085
CONSIDER REDUCING THE FUNDING

03:46:39.152 --> 03:46:40.820
LEVEL FOR THIS PROPOSAL JUST

03:46:40.887 --> 03:46:41.821
GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE

03:46:41.888 --> 03:46:43.256
GENERAL FUND AND THE LACK OF

03:46:43.323 --> 03:46:44.390
CLARITY ABOUT THE AMOUNT NEEDED

03:46:44.457 --> 03:46:45.959
FOR THIS PURPOSE. AS WAS NOTED

03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:47.727
THERE WAS FUNDING LAST YEAR

03:46:47.794 --> 03:46:48.461
THAT WAS PERMITTED SEVENTY FIVE

03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:50.863
MILLION- IF APPROVED TO

03:46:50.930 --> 03:46:52.231
RECOMMEND TO ACTIONS FIRST

03:46:52.298 --> 03:46:53.933
ADOPTING LANGUAGE THAT FURTHER

03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:55.568
DEFINES HOW FUNDS TO BE USED

03:46:55.635 --> 03:46:56.569
SUCH AS THE AMOUNT FOR LOCAL

03:46:56.636 --> 03:46:57.704
ASSISTANCE VERSUS THE

03:46:57.770 --> 03:46:59.739
OBLIGATION SO AND WE THINK IT'S

03:46:59.806 --> 03:47:01.941
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS BECAUSE

03:47:02.008 --> 03:47:02.575
CURRENTLY THE LANGUAGE IS VERY

03:47:02.642 --> 03:47:04.377
BROAD. BASICALLY CAN BE USED

03:47:04.444 --> 03:47:05.645
FOR ANY COMMUNITY RESILIENCY

03:47:05.712 --> 03:47:08.081
ACTIVITIES BY STATE OR OR LOCAL

03:47:08.147 --> 03:47:10.516
ENTITIES AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR

03:47:10.583 --> 03:47:12.051
EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE OR EVEN

03:47:12.118 --> 03:47:12.552
IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:47:12.618 --> 03:47:15.254
INTENSITY THAT MOSTLY FOR

03:47:15.321 --> 03:47:17.323
LOCALS THAT IT'S NOT CLEARLY

03:47:17.390 --> 03:47:19.659
DEFINED IN THE LANGUAGE. ON

03:47:19.726 --> 03:47:22.996
THIS SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

03:47:23.062 --> 03:47:24.998

BUDGET YEAR- LANGUAGE. AND WE

03:47:37.076 --> 03:47:37.944
THINK THIS WILL GIVE THE

03:47:38.011 --> 03:47:39.345
LEGISLATURE'S ADDITIONAL

03:47:39.412 --> 03:47:39.979
