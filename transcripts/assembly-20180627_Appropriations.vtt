HERE AND THAT'S THE INFLUENCE OF

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:59.203
THE ENVIRONMENT AND MANY OF US

DO WHAT HAPPENS BY DEFAULT AND

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.106
SO THIS BILL IS REALLY CHANGING

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.640
THAT SO WE'RE MAKING THE HEALTHY

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:05.109
CHOICE THE EASY CHOICE.

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:07.111
BY NOT PRIMING CHILDREN TO

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.278
CONSUME SUGARY DRINKS.

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:09.980
THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION THE

TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND LARGE

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:14.618
BUSINESSES AND THE

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:16.553
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE STATE

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.855
ARE QUITE SMALL BECAUSE THIS IS

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:18.655
BEING PULLED IN FOLDED INTO

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.357

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.793
HEALTH DIRECTORS.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.995

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.031
SMART THAT RELIEVED TRULY

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:29.199

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:35.472
ACTUALLY JUST A WARNING IT'S

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.607
SORT OF A FIX THAT TICKET.

00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.242
BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.710
PENALIZE BUSINESSES THE GOAL

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:41.345
REALLY IS TO GET THEM TO BE PART

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.946
OF THE SOLUTION AND BEING ABLE

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.615

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:45.816
SMALL CHANGES TO THE ENVIRONMENT

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.584
CAN MAKE A REALLY BIG IMPACT AND

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.219

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.150
THIS IS ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WE

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.952

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:04.187

NARROW PART OF THIS BILL.

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.396
AND THAT DEALS WITH THE VOUCH

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.932
VOUCHER SYSTEM --

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:18.201
COMBINATION HARD SUCTION ORG

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.669

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:24.574
IN OUR PROGRAM.

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.643
AS A VETERAN I'M WELL AWARE OF

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.311
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:29.946
AFFAIRS AND THEIR ACTIVITY XIN

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:30.981
FULLY SUPPORT.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:33.183
THEIR MISSION.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.452
BUT IN ORDER BUT JUDGMENT AND

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.954
THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR MEMBERS

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:40.056
THEY HAVE FALLEN SHORT.

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:42.058
IN THE SUPPORT THE DISH

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.094
PROMOTION UNDER THE VASH PROGRAM.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.264
AS A CONSEQUENCE WE FIND EMBERS

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.899
WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:50.834
PROGRAM IN THE PAST.

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:51.935
AND HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:55.171
PROGRAM BECAUSE OF VARIOUS

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:57.407
DEFICIENCIES PARTICULARLY WITH

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:01.811

AND DELAY IN QUALIFICATION.

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:10.921
SO THERE ARE MANY STEPS IN THE

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.523
PROGRAM THAT WE FIND FAULT WITH

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.492
IN SOME AREAS.

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:19.095

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.595
ENORMOUS.

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.663
