MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:40.766
EFFECTIVELY. IS AN ABSOLUTE

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.202
PRIORITY WHAT WE HAVE DONE

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.070
SINCE THE TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:47.239
HERE IS WE HAVE INVESTED MORE

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:50.109
IN REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS AT THE

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:53.679

COMPLAINTS. ARE AND THIS

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.885
INCLUDES A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:02.188
MEDICAL REVIEW OF CASE. WHERE

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.055
IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCE IT HAS

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.591
OBVIATED THE NEED FOR CASES TO

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.460
GO TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.195
WHEN THERE IS AN INITIAL

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:12.932
DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS NO

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:13.532
DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD OF

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:14.400
CARE. FURTHERMORE IT'S THE

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.035
EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THESE

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.604
CASES WHICH WILL AT THE END

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.872
DELIVER MORE EFFECTIVE

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:22.174
ENFORCEMENT AND MORE EFFICIENT

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.043
ENFORCEMENT. SINCE THE TIME

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.745
THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE POSITION

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.381
THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF CASES

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.283
WITHIN THE COMPLAINTS SYSTEM.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.619
HAS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:36.055
10% NOW THE MOST MPORTANT

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:38.858
THING IS FOR EACH CASE TO BE

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.926
DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY THERE

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:43.195
WILL BE SOME CASES THAT REQUIRE

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.064
MORE RESOURCES. AND WILL

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.667
REQUIRE- OF THE ABSOLUTE

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:49.702
DEDICATION TO COME TO A

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:51.036
SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.638
PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT WHERE

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:53.939
IT'S POSSIBLE WERE CASES ARE

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.741
LESS SERIOUS BUT THERE IS NO

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.377
ISSUE OF FITNESS TO PRACTISE IF

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.211
WE CAN DEAL WITH THOSE

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.814
EFFECTIVELY. AT AN EARLY STAGE

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.582
THAT WILL BOTH PROTECT THE

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.684
PUBLIC AND BE COST EFFECTIVE SO

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.753
THAT IS ONE AREA OF SAVINGS

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.622
THERE'S ANOTHER AREA OF SAVINGS

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.423
IN TERMS OF. MAKING OUR

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.893

AND THIS IS A WAY TO DO OUR JOB

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.512
MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.715
EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT ANY

NO LONGER ANTICIPATED TO BE THE

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.394
CASE BUT STILL THERE IS A

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.563
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE WHICH WE

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.365

INABILITY OF OUR POSTDOCTORAL

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:09.087
TRAINING LICENSEES FROM BEEN

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:12.724
BILLING MEDICAL FEE FOR SERVICE

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.925
WHILE MOONLIGHTING. MANY OF OUR

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.527
POOREST COMMUNITIES MANY OF

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:18.196
THEM THAT I REPRESENT. MEDICAL

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:19.931
AND IF WE ARE SHUTTING OFF ONE

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:21.833
AVENUE FOR ACCESS TO CARE WE

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.335
ONLY BROUGHT IN THE HEALTH

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:25.370
DISPARITIES FOR OUR MOST

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:27.005
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THIS

00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.341
SEEMS LIKE AN ISSUE THAT THE

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:31.209
LEGISLATURE COULD QUICKLY FIX

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:34.312
THE OPEN UP SERVICES. IF YOU

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:37.415
COULD DOCTOR LAWSON AND MISTER

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:38.984
PLUS HE FORGOT WOULD YOU BE

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.452
WILLING TO PROVIDE THE BOARD'S

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.320
PERCEPTION OF THE P. L. T.

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:43.889
RESTRICTED STATUS FOR

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:45.724
MOONLIGHTING. AND WHETHER YOU

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.260
THINK THE LEGISLATURE REMEDY

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.594
WOULD BE THE ONLY COURSE OF

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:56.968
ACTION TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.103
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.871
QUESTION AND CERTAINLY THE PTO

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.474
LICENSES- THE ACCESSIBILITY IS

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.743
AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR THE

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.278
BOARD ONE OF THE WHOLE REASON

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.846
SUPPORT THE PTL IN THE FIRST

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.881
PLACE. JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.650
WAS TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:13.318
BECAUSE WITH AN INTRODUCTION OF

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:15.187
THE P. T. L. WE NOW HAVE THE

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:17.589
ABILITY TO HAVE. OF THE

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.724
LICENSEES FROM OTHER MEDICAL

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.092
SCHOOLS WHICH WE NEVER HAD

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:23.461
BEFORE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:24.563
DEDICATED TO SOLVING THE

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.632
PROBLEM. WE ARE MEETING WITH%

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:31.436
ALL THE RELEVANT OFFICIALS. AND

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:33.505
THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.507
POSSIBLE FOR A SOLUTION TO BE

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:37.442
REACHED. WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT TO

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.077
OTHER PRESIDENTS WHAT OTHER

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:42.113
STATES ARE DOING. WE WILL DO

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.049
THAT. IF NOTHING OF COURSE WE

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:45.684
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE A

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.786
LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IF

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:50.589
NECESSARY. BUT WE THINK THAT WE

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:51.723
NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.458
ISSUE THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:55.493
WE COULD DO ADMINISTRATIVELY I

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.529
MEAN AFFECTED LATE IF YOU TAKE

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.431
A STEP BACK. IF YOU LOOK AT

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.967
WHAT THESE DOCTORS ARE DOING IF

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:03.869
YOU LOOK AT THE TRAINING THAT

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:06.571
THEY HAVE RECEIVED. THERE IS NO

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:09.241
INCREASED RISK TO THE PUBLIC.

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:12.244
THAT WOULD IN ANY WAY JUSTIFY

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.712
THEM NOT BEING REIMBURSED FOR

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:16.081
WORK THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.949
OF THESE LICENSEES HAVE BEEN

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:20.051
DOING. IF ANYTHING I WOULD

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:21.519
ARGUE THERE IS GREATER PRESSURE

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.421
PUBLIC PROTECTION BECAUSE THEY

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.357
ARE NOW FORMALLY WITHIN A

00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:27.359
PROGRAM IN THE PROGRAM

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.728
DIRECTORS FOR APPROVAL WHICH WE

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:33.632
THINK IS A VERY GOOD SAFEGUARD.

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:35.267
BUT WE'RE ABSOLUTE DEAD. TO

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.402
WORKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.871
WE HOPE LEGISLATION IS NOT

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.407
REQUIRED. BUT IF WE REACH THAT

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:44.209
DETERMINATION WE WILL BE VERY

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.844
HAPPY TO ROLE IN IT TO DO

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:48.313
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ASSISTED

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.649
AND PERHAPS- PRESIDENT LAWSON

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:54.619
WOULD LIKE TO. ADD TO THAT. I

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.087
JUST WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:57.822
THOSE COMMENTS- EXECUTIVE

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:01.693
OFFICER PACIFICA- AND- ALSO A

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.462
SURE- DOCTOR ARAMBULA THAT THE

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.064
MEDICAL BOARD IS COMMITTED TO

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:08.266
THESE ISSUES THE MEDICAL BOARD-

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.634
WILL BE MEETING ON MAY

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.136
THIRTEENTH AND MAY FOURTEENTH

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:13.271
AS A BOARD AND I. EXPECT THIS

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:14.973
TO BE A TOPIC OF OUR

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.342
CONVERSATION THERE AS WELL. I

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.944
WANNA DIG INTO ONE OF THE

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.545
POINTS THOUGH THAT HAPPENED MR

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:23.014
PACIFICA HAD MENTIONED WHICH IS

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.349
THERE'S NO RISK TO THE PUBLIC I

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.917
THINK THE QUESTION I HAVE IS A

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:27.285
FOR DECREASING ACCESS FOR THE

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:30.689
PUBLIC TO RECEIVE SERVICES. IF

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.357
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.259
TO SEE DOCTORS. BECAUSE THEY

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:36.494
ARE UNABLE TO BUILD FOR FEE FOR

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:38.830
SERVICE IS THAT NOT A RISK TO

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:40.332
THE PUBLIC. NO I BE JUST TO

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:42.701
CLARIFY WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.102
WAS THE WRIST FROM THE POINT OF

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.937
VIEW OF MEDIC COW. MEDIC COW

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.572
ARE SAYING THAT THEY DON'T WANT

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.840
TO PAY THESE LICENSE THESE

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:50.308
DOCTORS BECAUSE SOMEHOW THAT

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:51.776
THEY ARE ON A RESTRICTED

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.745
LICENSE. AND THEREFORE LESS

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.213
ABLE TO PRACTICE I THINK THAT

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.282
IS WRONG SO I WAS REFERRING TO

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.483
THE REST FROM THE POINT OF

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.852
MEDICARE. I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:02.821
THE FACT THAT IF THERE'S ANY

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:04.689
DEVIATION OF IN SERVICE THAT IS

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.424
A HUGE PROBLEM. AND WE ARE

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.460
DEDICATED TO RESOLVING ISSUES

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:12.831
OF LICENSEE IN WAYS. THAT

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:14.499
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.935
ASK FOR THIS. THIS IS OUR

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:21.272
KRAUSS- WHAT YOU'RE GRADUATE

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:24.342
MEDICAL AT WHICH ALL RIGHT FOR.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.745
IT'S KNOWLEDGE IS THAT

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.813
MOONLIGHTING A SIX SO LONG IT

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.181
IS WITH AS IT IS WITH THE

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:32.083
PERMISSION OF THE RESIDENCY

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.219
PROGRAM I AM EVEN DURING

00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:36.621
MOONLIGHTING HOURS RESIDENTS IN

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:38.390
TRAINING ARE STILL. UNDER

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:39.824
SUPERVISION BY THEIR RESIDENCY

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:42.527
PROGRAM. THERE IS NEITHER

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:45.130
INTENT NOR DESIRE ON THE PART

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:48.133
OF THE BOARD BUT TO STOP

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:51.169
MOONLIGHTING. I AND I AGREE DR

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.038
ARAMBULA THAT MOONLIGHTING HAS

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:54.973
BEEN AN IMPORTANT SERVICE OR

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.876
HAS HELPED PROVIDE IMPORTANT

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:59.911
SERVICE TO UNDERSERVED AREAS.

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:02.013
IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE ALWAYS

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.782
ARE FACED WITH UNINTENDED

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.650
CONSEQUENCES IN THIS PROBLEM

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.952
WAS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED WHEN

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:11.089
LEGISLATION WAS DRAFTED TO SEE

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:12.390
THREE YEARS OF POST GRADUATE

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.893
EDUCATION PRIOR TO LICENSURE

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:17.829
AND AS MR PERCEIVED TO HAS SAID.

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.330
WE ARE ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.666
THE TEN TO FIFTEEN OTHER STATES

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:23.535
THAT ALSO REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.703
POSTGRADUATE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.405
THEY HAVE FACED THE SAME

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:31.109
PROBLEM. SO WE BELIEVE THAT

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.944
THIS IS A FIXABLE PROBLEM- BUT

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:34.979
WE'VE JUST BEGUN TO WORK WITH

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.681
STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.516
ULTIMATELY DETERMINING WHAT THE

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:40.652
SOLUTION MAY BE- AND WE DON'T

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.887
KNOW YET DEFERRED LEGISLATIVE

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:45.390
ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED- BUT IT

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:48.326
IS OUR INTENT. TO ALLOW

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:50.428
MOONLIGHTING TO CONTINUE AS IT

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.297
HAS SO THAT THERE IS NO

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:53.331
INTERRUPTION OF MEDICAL

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:55.567
SERVICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.469
KRAUSE AND THEN IF I CAN I'D

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:59.504
LIKE TO ECHO OF OUR FOR

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.172
GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN SAYS

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.841
THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:04.442
SERVICE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAS

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.444
IS HE HAD A CHANCE TO FIX SOME

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.278
OF THE MISTAKES HE MADE WHILE

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.280
IN SERVICE. I THINK WE HAVE AN

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:11.049
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:12.750
UPON THE LEGISLATION THAT THIS

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.919
BODY HAS WORKED ON AND WE MUST

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.554
BE RECEPTIVE TO WHAT MANY OF

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.323
THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ON

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.791
THE FRONT LINES ARE SAYING.

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.559
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE LOWER

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.128
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OR MEDICAL

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.929
ASSOCIATIONS WHO ARE SPEAKING

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.698
ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO MEET

THIS CRISIS HEAD ON. P. AND

TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SPENDING

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.209
THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO ADDRESS

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.478
IT. IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO ASK

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:41.346
ONE FINAL QUESTION REGARDING

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:44.182
MENTAL HEALTH. ACCESS TO MENTAL

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.151
HEALTH SERVICES AND DE

STIGMATIZING THE- SPEAKING OF

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.455
MENTAL CARE IS IMPORTANT NOT

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.724
JUST TO OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.759

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.794
IMPORTANT TO THE DOCTORS WHO

KIDNEY POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING

LICENSEES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:09.307
OF THIS FIGHT AND WE SHOULD NOT

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:10.508
PUNISH THEM FOR SEEKING THE

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:12.443
CARE THEY NEED TO REMAIN FIT

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.212
FOR THE COMBATING AGAINST. COOK

BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:20.051
ALLOWS THE MEDICAL BOARD TO

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:23.855
ISSUE A PROBATIONARY PTL DUE TO

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:24.656

IMPLEMENTATION OR ENFORCEMENT

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.965

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.747
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE CHANGED

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.949
AND CHANGED TO THE REGULATIONS

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:41.986

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:50.294
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AS E'RE

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.196
WORKING THROUGH THAT ECONOMIC

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.231
INTERESTS TO SCHOOL TIME

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:55.466
INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.467
INCLUDED IN THE RULEMAKING

00:38:56.534 --> 00:39:02.106
PACKAGE. AND SO DOT WILL BE

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.542
MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE REVIEW

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:07.611
PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED TO

THREE D. CA AND BUSINESS

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.248
CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:14.819
AGENCY SO GREAT PROGRESS HAS

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:19.690
BEEN MADE THERE- AS FAR AS THE-

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:24.562
STIGMA- DE PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:27.264
WELLNESS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:30.968
PHYSICIANS TO SELF REPORT AND

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.636
TO YOU BECOME A PARTICIPANT IN

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.706
THAT PROGRAM WITHOUT A REPORT

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.476
BEING MADE TO THE BOARD SO LONG

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:41.145
AS THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.280
WITH ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:46.484
THE PROGRAM SHE AND THAT THE

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.252
UNIFORM STANDARDS ARE QUITE

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:53.023
STRICT. AND SO IF- THEY'RE NOT

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.359
FULLY COMPLIANT THEN THEY WILL

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.560
BE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.929

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:03.300
POSITION IN THE ENFORCEMENT

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:04.802
PART BLACK- THIS A REQUIREMENT

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.605
OF THE UNIFORM STANDARDS. AND

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.472
SO IT WILL BE OVER A

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.608
REQUIREMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:13.077
HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM- I

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.545
KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:16.447
THAT. THAT WILL MAKE IT LESS

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.748
LIKELY FOR SOMEONE TO SELL

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:22.086
HARPER- HEY. THAT IS A

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:24.121
REQUIREMENT IN THE BOARD WILL

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.857
FOLLOW THAT- I KNOW THAT THIS

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.793
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. CONSUMER

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:31.529
ADVOCATES WHO HAVE A HISTORY

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:34.498
WITH THE BOARDS AND NOW DEFUNCT

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:37.902
DIVERSION PROGRAM- WHICH ENDED

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.870
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THE

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:40.771
PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.039
PROGRAM IS NOT A DIVERSION

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:47.812
PROGRAM. SO GEN IF A PHYSICIAN

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:50.281
SELF PREFERS AND IS NOT FULLY

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:54.885
COMPLIANT THEN. SENATE ACTION

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.488
MAYBE THAT'LL COME. THE BRITISH

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:59.356
APPRECIATE THE ANSWER I THINK

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.458
IT'S UNFORTUNATE- WELL

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:02.660
CERTAINLY THAT THE PREVIOUS

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:03.928
DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT HAVE

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.963
SOME ISSUES- THAT THERE ARE

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.998
SOME WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO-

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:09.867
UNFORTUNATELY PLAY ON THE FEARS

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:12.703
OF THE PUBLIC- TO- TO

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.205
ESSENTIALLY WE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:15.172
DECREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.341
CARE WELL WE HAVE PHYSICIANS-

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.676
AND JUMP PHYSICIANS ARE PEOPLE

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:21.912
TOO THEY'RE NOT PERFECT- AND-

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.715
AND SO YOU- AND I CERTAINLY

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.516
UNDERSTAND POSITION THE BOARDS

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.651
AND- BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.987
NEED TO BE REASONABLE- AND WE

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.088
WANT TO BE SURE WE ARE TO

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.323
PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:33.724
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.693
REALITY NOT JUST SYMBOLICALLY

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.294
AND- THEREFORE DENYING

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.096
OPPOSITION TO COULD PROVIDE

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:41.832
SERVICES TO HE DIED VERY MUCH

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.834
NEEDED SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:46.103
THAT- THAT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.238
WE'RE DEBATE NOT NIT PICKING

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.173
THEM TO DEATH- AND ALSO

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.008
CREATING HERE- AND WE'RE

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:51.842
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WERE

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.510
WILLING TO COME FORWARD RIGHT-

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:55.145
SO THEY ACCEPT THE FACT THEY

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:57.047
HAVE A BIG ISSUE AND- AND THEN

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.549
BUT YET CREATING AT THE POLICY

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.552
YEAR OVER OVER THEM- THE DUTY

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.187
IS FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY SELF.

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.155
TO SEEK HELP AND I THINK THAT'S

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:06.557
KIND OF PRODUCTIVE BUT I

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.424
APPRECIATE THE POSITION THE

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.592
BOARD IS IN IN TRYING TO

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:09.760
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND PERHAPS

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:14.231
WE CAN REVISIT THIS. ISSUE

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:14.932
LEGISLATIVELY IN THE FUTURE.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.233

PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:28.512
THREE PHYSICIANS IN MY OWN

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.381

THAT THIS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.803

AND- THERE WAS NO ISSUE THAT

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.010
THE MAY ISSUE ACTUALLY I CAN

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:42.780
OUTSIDE WHICH I. PTL AND THOSE

A CONTINUE BACK AND FORTH

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.215
BETWEEN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:46.316
CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:48.685
DECADES AGO AND THE MEDICAL

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.154
BOARD OF MASSACHUSETTS WHICH OF

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.189
COURSE I HAD. NO NO PROBLEMS OF

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:53.123
MY LICENSE BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.526
P. T. L. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.561
CALIFORNIA WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT.

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:58.362
SO NOW IT'S FINE IT'S

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.029
INTERESTING WHEN HAVING

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:00.597
DISCUSSION ABOUT DETAILS HERE

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:03.700
IN CALIFORNIA- BUT I HOPE THAT-

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:05.235
THAT THERE'S SOME CONVERSATION

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.303
ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKING WITH

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.671
OTHER STATES I KNOW SOME OF

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.405
THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:09.706
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THERE

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:10.574
ARE I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:12.076
THERE ARE CERTAIN. WELL WE HAVE

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:12.976
SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.079
IMPLEMENTATION OF DETAIL THERE-

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:17.581
PUT THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.516
WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DO ONE-

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.485
BUT I HOPE THAT- BUT I THINK

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:22.486
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- THE

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.455
MEDICAL BOARD KEEPS- ARE

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:26.356
COMMITTEES UP TO DATE AND ALSO

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:27.891
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.626
TO DO TO HELP. I REALIZE THAT

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:30.828
MANY OF THE ISSUES ARE ACTUALLY

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:31.361
DECISIONS OF THE FEDERAL

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:33.030
GOVERNMENT SEES A DETOX STANCE

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:35.032
ABOUT THE X. WAIVER- THE MEDIC

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.500
CAL PROGRAM WE CAN CERTAINLY

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.202
AYE KNOWS REACHED OUT TO DCS

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:40.070
ABOUT THIS- THERE'S SOME CMS

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.805
ISSUES. BUT WE REALLY SHOULD

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.073
TRY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER

LEGISLATION IS- IS ACHIEVED. HI

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.530
THIS IS SERRA KERRY WEBER AGAIN

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.965
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:05.702
QUESTION- THE MEDICAL BOARD

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:08.505
LICENSES AND REGULATES LICENSED

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:12.576
MIDWIVES AND THE BOARD OF

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.945
REGISTERED NURSING. WHY SINCE

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:17.447
IS A REGULATORS CERTIFIED NURSE

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:20.684
MIDWIVES AND- CERTIFIED NURSE

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.753
MIDWIVES THAT WERE RECENTLY

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.488
GRANTED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:27.023
INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. LICENSE

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.725
MIDWIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:31.461
MEDICAL BOARD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.296
PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:37.634
PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION SINCE

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.202
TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THAT IS

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:40.937
THE REASON WHY THE BOARD

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:43.673
SUPPORTS THEM ACTUALLY HAVING

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.743
THEIR OWN BOARD AND TO BE OUT

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.078
FROM UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:50.981
SINCE PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION HAS

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.749
NOT BEEN REQUIRED FOR SOME TIME.

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.584
THAT IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.319
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LICENSE UNDER

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.221
TWO DIFFERENT BOARDS THAT WE

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:58.889
NEED MORE LEGISLATION TO BE

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:01.191
ABLE TO- FURTHER MAKE THAT

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:04.694
CLEAR. THIS APP IS A PART OF

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:07.564
ADDING TO THE CONFUSION. ON IT.

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.266
I THINK THERE IS CONFUSION

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.568
BECAUSE- CERTIFIED NURSE

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:13.036
MIDWIVES ARE ACTUALLY

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:15.705
REGISTERED NURSES TO DAN DEAD

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.974
ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO BECOME

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.843
CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.045
LICENSED MIDWIVES HAVE THEIR

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.281
OWN PATHWAY THAT IS DIFFERENT

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:28.118
FROM THE MEDICAL MODEL. AND

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:31.988
THEY- AND MOSTLY D. PROVIDE

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:34.691
SERVICES IN THEIR CLIENTS HOMES

00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.493
WHERE A CERTIFIED NURSE

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.995
MIDWIVES- VERY FREQUENTLY

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.231
PROVIDE. THEIR SERVICES IN

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.900
HOSPITAL SETTINGS FOR OUR BIRTH

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:48.939
CENTERS- SO THAT THEY HAVE A

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:52.709
DIFFERENT. MODELED. HOW TO

00:51:52.776 --> 00:52:00.250
DIFFERENT- S. IS ON THAT

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:04.454
PREGNANCY LAY DAY. AND THEIR

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:05.121
REGULAR BY TWO DIFFERENT BUT IT

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.723
DOES CREATE CONFUSION BECAUSE

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.593
THEY'RE BOTH MIDWIVES. OKAY

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.728

AN EYE ON WHEN WE GET CLOSE TO

THAT DATE- WHAT THE IMPACT

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.004
WOULD BE IF THE WAIVER WAS NOT

IN THIS KIND OF CONSULTATION

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:16.125
AND MAKING THAT DETERMINATION.

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:20.363
THAT WILL- THE CLIENT TO RETURN

APPROPRIATE IN THE MIDWIFE

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:47.657
NEEDS TO MAKE THE DECISION

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:49.492
WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:52.028
STANDARD OF CARE SHE CONTINUED

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:54.330
TO BE THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER

00:58:54.397 --> 00:59:00.003
FOR THEIR CLIENTS- SO FAR THAT.

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:02.639
HAS NOT HAPPENED- IN THIS IS A

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:09.879
THE- RELATIONSHIP BE AN- AND SO.

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:13.917
THE BOARD AGAIN SUPPORT IS A

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:19.822
MIDWIVES. HAVING THEIR OWN.

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.758
FOR- AND IF THAT IS NOT

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.693
POSSIBLE THEN WE DO NEED TO

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.229
ADDRESS THE DIFFICULT LANGUAGE

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.898
IN THIS. THE CARD SECTION WELL

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:30.199
THE BOARD IS A SEPARATE ISSUE

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:33.269
HAVING TO DO WITH- STRUCTURAL

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.337
ISSUES AND WHETHER OF A

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.005
SEPARATE BOARD CAN. CAN

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.373
FUNCTION OR WHETHER IT'S GOING

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.741
TO START OUT IN A STRUCTURAL

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:40.710
DEFICIT SITUATION DEPENDING ON

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:41.978
THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES IN THE

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:44.147
FEES THEY CAN FURTHER A WHOLE

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.581
VARIETY OF ISSUES. INCLUDING

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:46.883
I'M SURE PRACTICE ISSUES

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:47.917
ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:49.085
ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEPARATE

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:50.420
BOARD BUT I THINK WHAT THE

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:52.922
SENATOR WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:53.523
IT IS WHAT SORT OF FIX DO YOU

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:55.391
NEED. IF THERE IS ANY

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:56.960
IMPEDIMENT TO INDEPENDENT

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:58.561
PRACTICE OF THESE LICENSED

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:00.596
MIDWIVES AND YOU. INDICATED

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.031
THAT THEY'RE PRACTICING

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:02.899
INDEPENDENTLY BUT HOW DO THEY

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:05.201
PRACTICE. INDEPENDENTLY IF THE

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.869
STATUTE ALLOWS THEM TO ASSIST

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.004
IN A NORMAL PREGNANCY AND

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:10.173
CHILDBIRTH AND WE AND NOBODY IS

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:12.308
DEFINED WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S A

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.943
QUESTION BUT LET ME RAINY LET

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.345
ME ASK ANOTHER ONE I'M NOT A

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.512
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER I'M

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:19.148
CERTAINLY NOT A PHYSICIAN. I

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:20.583
USED TO BE A LAWYER. NOT

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:23.853
ANYMORE. I GUESS. THAT I'VE-

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.154
BEEN A MEMBER OF VARIOUS

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.789
HOSPITAL BOARDS IN THE WAY BACK

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:29.058
AND I REMEMBER. I SEEM TO

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.194
REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS THIS

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.861
DEBATE OVER C. SECTIONS AND

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:34.397
WHETHER. AFTER A C. SECTION YOU

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.232
SHOULD HAVE A NORMAL DELIVERY

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:36.966
OR NOT HAVE A NORMAL DELIVERY

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.202
OR BE. HAVE ANOTHER C. SECTION

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:40.970
AND SO THIS WHOLE LACK OF

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:44.240
AGREEMENT ON CURRENCY SECTION.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.608
SEEMS TO BE SORT OF AN

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:46.876
IMPEDIMENT WHICH WAS THE

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:47.777
QUESTION ARE THERE ANY

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:50.947
IMPEDIMENTS AND HOW. I GUESS WE

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.115
NEED TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.716
WE NEED TO DO IN A SUNSET BILL

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.118
IN ORDER TO ALLOW LICENSED

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.252
MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.186
INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN THE

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.322
MEANING OF THE STATUTE. CAN YOU

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:07.663
HELP US. OKAY WELL. DO WE NEED

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.265
TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.800
SOMEONE WHO HAS A PRIOR C.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:13.136
SECTION MAY BE ATTENDED BY A

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:16.939
LICENSED MIDWIFE. I CAN TELL

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.075
YOU THAT LICENSE BID WIVES ARE

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:22.812
PERFORMING E. B. BACKS AT HOME-

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:26.149
THE ISSUE IS CLIENT SELECTION.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:29.085
AND I THINK OVER ALL LICENSED

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:33.189
MIDWIVES TAKE GREAT CARE IN-

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.824
THEY'RE SELECTING AS CLIENTS

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:37.060
AND TO THEIR RETAIN US CLIENTS

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.662
THAT THE CONDITION ARISES. AND

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.798
SO THAT'S HOW THE PRACTICE.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.400
INDEPENDENTLY IS THAT- THEY

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:47.403
HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LEGISLATION

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.939
AND SO THEY CAN'T TAKE ON CASES

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:55.445
WHERE THERE'S- AND IT YOU MORE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:02:03.953
THAN THAN. THEN WHY FEEDER-

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.660
DATE CAN'T BE BURIED. THEY HAVE

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:11.727
TO. YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS PERIOD

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.363
DELIVERIES EXPECT THAT GO OVER

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:21.337
OR OR BE TREAT- ANDS. YOUR DAY

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:21.904

GO HOME AT THE SAME TIME- I DID

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.403
HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.138
TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.474
AND I UNDERSTAND. THE DESIRE

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.910
TO- CREATE A SEPARATE BOARD AND

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.812
THAT MAY. HAPPEN AND THAT YOU

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:17.280
KNOW MAYBE A DIFFERENT

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.048
DISCUSSION. BUT WITH THE TASK

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:20.683
FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.918
THERE WAS A- I MENTIONED THAT

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.187
THERE WAS NO. LIKE MIDWIFE ON

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.155
THERE WAS THERE EVER ANY

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.690
THOUGHT TO CHANGE IT OVER TO

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:28.858
LIKE MAYBE A STANDING COMMITTEE

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.760
OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU DO. HAVE

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.828
THE INPUT. OF SOMEONE FROM THE

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:35.531
MIDWIFERY COMMUNITY. TO HELP.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.700
FLESH OUT SOME OF THESE I AM.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.702
VERY INTRICATE SIDE. THINGS

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.537
THAT YOU KNOW. SOMEONE WHO

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.606
DOESN'T PRACTICE OF STATICS MAY

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.641
NOT UNDERSTAND. RIGHT AND THIS

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:50.012
IS KERRY WEBER AGAIN AND- THE

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.348
TOPS FOR. THAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:56.886
OF. AB DE MADE UP OF. TWO BOARD

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.422
FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD CHIEF

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:02.425
BOARD MEMBER. BUT WHEN THE-

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:08.631
FORCE MET- DOES MEETING

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:11.334
INCLUDED AND OF MIDWIVES THAT

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.371
ARE IN THE CAN- REPRESENTATIVES

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:18.341
A COG AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:22.445
CMA TO TRY TO CRAFT LANGUAGE

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:28.884
THAT- COULD AVOID OP. AS IT

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:33.522
MOVES THROUGH THE VILLAGE. AND-

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.691
MANY MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:38.394
FOLLOWING THAT MEETING. SUCH

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.665
LANGUAGE WAS CREATED HOWEVER-

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.667
THERE WERE CERTAIN FACTIONS

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:49.872
THAT WORKED TO- OPPOSE IT AND

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.808
SO THE FIX WAS NOT INCLUDED IN

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:56.379
THE BOARD'S LAST SUNSET HILL-

01:06:56.445 --> 01:07:00.916

ALWAYS HELPFUL THAT WE CAN

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:06.122
IMPROVE THIS AREA BECAUSE THE

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:09.291
LEGISLATURE GAVE MIDWIVES THE

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.426

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.136
SAID BIDS CAN BE DONE

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.272
EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY AND

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.908
RECOGNIZE THEM AS- THE

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:28.611
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS THAT

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:32.948
THEY ARE- BUT- AND TO IMPROVE

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:38.721
THEIR ABILITY TO CONSULT- WITH

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.589
PHYSICIANS IN A COLLABORATIVE

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.793
WAY- I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.895
THAT THERE IS SAID MIDWIFERY

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:48.063
ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT MEETS

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.800

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.875
FOR LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:04.146
CHANGES BUT THE STRUCTURE- IT

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.714
HAS ITS DIFFICULTIES FOR THE

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:09.952
REASONS THAT I'VE- SAID BEFORE.

YOU KNOW- THE STIGMA AROUND

MENTAL HEALTH- IT'S NOT- JUST

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.750
SOMETHING THAT WE SEE WITH

COVERT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:44.353
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.855
VERY LONG TIME WE HAVE-

PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. AND IF WE DO

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.459

PER COUNTY- I KNOW THAT IN MY A

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.501
LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW DIGGING

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:22.905
THROUGH INFORMATION- FOR

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.207

THAT INTO THAT REPORT- AND ALSO

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:49.832
WHAT I ALSO FOUND A LITTLE BIT-

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.900
ALARMING I WOULD SAY IS. I'D BE

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:56.105
INFORMATION ON- THE TRANSFER OF

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.774

VBAC AB BACK AND I APOLOGIZE

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.319
I'M NOT YOU KNOW THE V. G. Y.

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.553
AND R. DR JUST TRYING TO

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.188
UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:15.624
BUT- OUT YET THERE'S ABOUT

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.192
TWENTY ONE CLIENTS THAT HAD

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:20.896
DEVELOPED. HYPERTENSION DURING

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.132
THE PREGNANCY AND HAD TO BE

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.900
THAT THERE THERE ARE CARE HAD

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.635
TO BE TRANSFERRED. AND THERE

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.337
WAS A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.838
FIFTY THREE CLIENTS AND F.

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:34.443
SHORTLY BEFORE- YOU KNOW

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.880
DELIVERY. I THERE WAS ALL. INTO

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:41.717
TRANSFER CARE AT IN ISSUES LIKE

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:43.185
YOU PROLONGED RUPTURE OF

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.988
MEMBRANES AND- AND THAT HAD YOU

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.055
KNOW WHAT THE UMBER IS MUCH

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.457
HIGHER THERE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.559
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT-

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.161
THAT- YOU KNOW THE RECORD CAME

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:55.664
UP. SO I THINK THAT THIS THIS.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.599
I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.968
ITS OWN ESTABLISHING ITS OWN-

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:04.807
BOARD GIVEN FACT. THERE COULD

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:07.042
BE COMPLICATIONS RIGHT- IT

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.777
COULD BE YOUR PRIOR TO OR

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:12.114
DURING. I DON'T REALLY KNOW TOO

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.916
MUCH BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:17.452
IS THAT THAT- THERE'S REAL

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:20.455
CONCERN ABOUT THE- AT THE

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:22.591
PATIENT AND THE CARE- AND THERE

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:24.927
SEEMS TO BE KIND OF TO KIND OF

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.129
TWO STANDARDS. NOT TO. APPS NOT

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.564
TO STANDARDS OF CARE BUT

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.333
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT- A

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.502
PRACTICE ACTS THAT- THAT THAT

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:34.970
HAVE TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:39.007
NOBODY OBGYN- ABIDES BY ONE-

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:39.775
PRACTICE ACTING IN THE

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:41.710
MIDWIFERY AT. ABIDES BY

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:46.548
DIFFERENT ONE SO- SO IF YOU

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:47.783
COULD PLEASE COMMENT OR OR

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.185
PROVIDE AN ANSWER ON- MY

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:55.457
STATEMENT PLEASE. I'M HAPPY TO

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:56.892
COMMENT ON THAT CENTER HER

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.327
CHINA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:02.664
THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW THE

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:06.068
TRANSFER OF CARE. THAT TELLS US

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:10.005
THAT MIDWIVES ARE ACTING

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.907
APPROPRIATELY THAT IS PRETTY

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:15.344
CONDITION ARISES THAT IS BEYOND

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:19.815
THEIR SCOPE THEY ARE SENDING

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:24.519
THAT PERSON TO THE HOSPITAL AND-

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.054
YOUR THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:36.531
IMPORTANT- AS- DOCTOR WEB SAID-

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.467
THESE KIDS- IT'S YOU HAVE A

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.469
CLAIM THAT THAT FALLS WITHIN

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:43.238
THE LICENSED MIDWIFE SCOPE OF

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:44.840
PRACTICE. AND SOMETHING TO

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:45.540
DURING THE COURSE OF THE

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:48.744
DELIVERY AND SO THE MIDWIFE

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.412
APPROPRIATELY SINCE THE PERSON

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.547
TO THE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:54.616
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:57.419
TO DO WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.288
AND SO THE BOARD DOESN'T

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:02.891
CONSIDER THAT IN AND OF ITSELF

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:05.928
NEGATIVE- OF COURSE QUESTIONS

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:08.563
ARISE. IF THEY ACTED WITHIN THE

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.832
STANDARD OF CARE ON THE TINY OF

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.100
THE TRANSFER SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:15.170
DONE SOONER- SHE WAS A SENATE

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.072
APPROPRIATE CLIENTS TO TAKE

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:20.008
BOND TO BEGIN WITH OR TO KEEP

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.577
IT THE CONDITION AROSE. BUT THE

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:23.645
FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.314
TRANSFERS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.318
EXPECT THEM TO DO IF SOMETHING

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.486
CHANGES STAND. SHOULD SAFETY

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:34.990
REQUIRE THAT. AND AS A FOLLOW-

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.793
THE MIDWIFERY ACT AUTHORIZES

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:39.361
AUTHORIZES A LICENSE FEE TO

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.829
ATTEND CASES OF NORMAL

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.866
PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH- SO

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.336
HOW DOES IT MEAN IT KINDA JUST

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.571
SEEMS TO. KIND OF CONTRADICT

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:53.575
ITSELF IF THERE'S A IF A

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.444
PREGNANCY CAN HAVE A

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:56.945
COMPLICATION AND IT WOULD IN

01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.282
AND MANY DO- DOESN'T THAT KIND

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.484
OF CONTRACT DICT BE ACTED

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:06.688
ITSELF. WELL IT. GOES ON TO

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.624
FURTHER DEFINE NORMAL PREGNANCY

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:12.594
AS SAYING THAT THERE IS AN

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.095
ABSENCE OF BOTH OF THE

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:16.131
FOLLOWING ANY PRE EXISTING

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.966
MATERNAL DISEASE OR CONDITION

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.535
LIKELY TO AFFECT THE PREGNANCY

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.438
AND THAT'S THAT LANGUAGE THAT I

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:25.440
REFERRED TO BEFORE AS- BEING A

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:26.641

SIGNIFICANT THE Z. IS A- FROM

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:39.988
THE PREGNANCY- SO THIS IS

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:42.324
SOMETHING WHERE. THE

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.760

THE ONE WAS FOR PROFIT SCHOOL

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:12.200
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WAS

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:15.003
SAID WHEN THERE IS A SHIFT TO

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.638
POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSES

ABOUT- PTL AND IT BEING

IS THAT THESE THREE POLICIES

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:59.741

YOU MISS A FEW MONTHS- WHATEVER

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.378
