TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT A BILL RELATING TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING AND FLEET OPERATOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ACT MEMBERS CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED AMBITIOUS GOALS IN OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE THREATS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS THROUGH STATEWIDE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN REQUIRING ALL AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ZERO EMISSION. BY TWENTY THIRTY. NOW THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY OUR LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO PROMOTE. DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ACCELERATE. THE SHIFT AWAY FROM NON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THE PROGRAM UTILIZES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS TO PROVIDE GRANT FUND SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS SHARE SERVICES ARE AN EMERGING INDUSTRY- THAT CAN HELP TO ACHIEVE ALLEGED VEHICLE AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS BY EXPANDING PUBLIC ACCESS. ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION. THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE CDP THIS CREAM TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAVE NOT YET BEEN UPDATED TO ACCOMMODATE THESE NEW AV TECHNOLOGIES IN EVALUATING THEIR ADVOCACY AND HELPING THE STATE MEET VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION TARGETS. AT THIS BILL TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE C. T. P. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TO INCLUDE ZERO EMISSION AV INFRASTRUCTURE AND REFUELING PROJECTS TO ALLOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES CONSIDERATION FOR GRANT FUNDING. THIS ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION WILL INCREASE EQUITABLE PUBLIC ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND BROADEN THE STATE'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TESTIFYING THIS MORNING WE HAVE A SALE BUT EITHER FROM CRUISE. THE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL WHEN. THE FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU WILL BEGIN WITH- CONSERVE OUR ALTHOUGH HE'S GOT- THREE MINUTES TO- MAKE HIS ARGUMENTS AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO AN OPPOSITION SPEAKER THAT'LL HAVE THREE MINUTES BUT BROUGHT WILL GO TO JOSE A LOT OF THOSE SPEAKERS OF SUPPORT AFTER- IS FOR SALE BUT ALTHOUGH PRESENT. YES WE BEGIN. GREAT THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS MY NAME'S ALVARADO AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF AN ALL ELECTRIC THE TIME IS THE OF A COMPANY CALLED CREWS TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT.

FROM FARMS IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY. FOR A FLEET OF ALL ELECTRIC SELF DRIVING VEHICLES. GENERATING NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT CREATING A SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE MORE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION FUTURE THAT CAN BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA SENATE AMBITIOUS SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. NECESSARY TO MOVE TOWARDS A CLEANER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SENATE BILL TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT BOB ADVANCE OUR CLIMATE GOALS BY ALLOWING ZERO EMISSION AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE FLEETS SB ELIGIBLE FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY WILL PROVIDE AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO INCREASING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ADDITIONALLY THEY'LL HELP TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION FUTURE BY ALLOWING ANYONE TO TAKE A GREEN RIDE. REGARDLESS THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR HAVE ACCESS TO A CHARGER. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE BUILD OUT OF THEIR MISSION INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED MORE. THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO ADVANCE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA GREAT NEW GREEN JOBS AND HELP US WORK TOWARDS OUR CLIMATE GOALS. EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM TO AB FLEETS IS A SMART WAY TO CONTINUE THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTING JOBS THAT BUILD AND MAINTAIN DECEMBER STRUCTURE. THIS BILL BUILT ON IMPORTANT LEGISLATION PASSED INTO LAW LAST YEAR. WITH THE SUPPORT OF LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS NAVY LEADERS REQUIRING YOU IT'S HONESTLY. TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OUR CENTER POSITION ON HIGH LEVEL ARGUMENTS ON AV TECHNOLOGY IN GENERAL HOWEVER RESPECTFULLY MUST NOTE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT WHETHER TO PERMIT A TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA. THERE'S CURRENTLY THE PURVIEW OF THE DMV AND THE CPC. SENATE BILL TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT WILL HELP CALIFORNIA TO MAKE TANGIBLE STRIDES TOWARDS CLIMATE GOALS AND SUPPORT JOBS AND BY DOING THIS INSURER MORE RESILIENT FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS ARE STRICTLY ASCARI VOTE.

OKAY VERY WELL NOW WILL MEET MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE WE HAVE AN ORGANIZED A PRESENTATION IN OPPOSITION WITH MATT BROUGHT WHAT THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS A PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL MATT ARE YOU EITHER HERE OR ON THE LINE. THANKS MISTER CHAIR MAC BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL I IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT I THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS BROADLY HI JUST ABOUT A TIME IS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY BUT ABOUT THE PRECEDENT OF CREATING. LEGIBILITY UNDER PROGRAM FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISPLACE WORKERS THAT'S A CONCERN FOR US IN THE LONG RUN I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- THEY NOW THIS IS ON PAGE TWO YOU WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ALREADY CURRENT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE FUNDING AND YOU KNOW THAT LEAVES US WONDERING. WHY THE BILL WOULD BE NECESSARY OTHER THAN THERE ARE ONLY TWO COMPANIES IN THE STATE CREASON WAY MAYO WHO ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON- THIS SORT OF LIKE FLEET TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD CREATE ELIGIBILITY PARTICULARLY FOR THEM AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSITION TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. NOW WILL GO TO. AND OF THE MEASURE LIMITING THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION.

FOUR OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE FIFTY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL COME OUT TO THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS. ON SB TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT IS THERE ANY MEMBER DISCUSSION. ANY COMMENTS- CENTER GONZALEZ YES THANK YOU- MR CHERRY JUST WANTED TO ASK THE AUTHOR- TO A QUESTION OF TIMING THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR. THANK YOU- JUST RELATED TO THE OPPOSITION I KNOW. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND HOW TO MODERNIZE THIS AND OF COURSE LOOKING AT. YOUR MISSION TECHNOLOGY- HOW DO YOU ADDRESS- JUST THE YOU KNOW CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF. THERE ARE A- THIRD SUGGESTION THAT THIS COULD DISPLACE WORKERS OVERALL YEAH- I MEAN THE AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL- THAT WE SEE IS BASICALLY IT LIVE LIMITS ELIGIBILITY TO PROGRAMS THAT THAT ARE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES SO IT SIMPLY DOESN'T IMPACT TRUCKING AND SHIPPING WHICH IS WHERE THE JOBS ARE NOW THAT THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THE FOLKS ABOUT REPRESENTS I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A KIND OF BROADER IDEOLOGICAL SENATE CERN'S ABOUT. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO BE WATCHING CAREFULLY AS THIS WHOLE DEBATE CONTINUES. BUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS JUST LIMITED TO LIGHT DUTY. AND SAID THAT THE TYPE OF JOB DISPLACEMENT THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT I THINK RIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT JUST ISN'T- HILLS IMPACTED BY THIS BILL. WELL THANK YOU IN OF COURSE I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOU- YOU KNOW- OF ANSWERING THAT I DO YOU SHARE THOSE CONCERNS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TASK FORCES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THAT AGE YOU DON'T HAVE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE BOTH LABOR AND BUSINESS LOOKING AT- ATOMIC ALLERGY AND JUST. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE FUTURE AND SO- WOULD LOVE TO JUST KEEP CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH CLEAN TRANSFER ABSOLUTE GRAHAM HAD ALSO SENT A LETTER AND I WELCOME THAT THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG IN AND BEFORE CENTER HERTZBERG SPEAKS JUST TO. EXPAND ON THAT ANSWER HAVING SERVED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORK ON EARLY- PROBABLY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THE EX CREDIT ON MACHINERY AND I ARGUED- THAT. PUTTING A TAX ON- THAT PLATE REPLACES WORKERS WASN'T REALLY. A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY BACK THEN. THE LABOR FEDERATION WAS PUSHING THAT AND THEIR ARGUMENT WAS. THAT TYPE OF POLICY ACTUALLY HELP TO CREATE JOBS IN A DIFFERENT AREA ON THEM THE WORKERS- THE JOBS THAT WERE HELP. THAT WORD MORE- GEAR TO. OPERATING MACHINERY. AND MAINTAINING THE MACHINE- IN THERE WERE HIGHERPAYING JOBS SO ON THE ONE HAND- THE MACHINERY OF CRATER PROFICIENCIES AND THE TAX CREDIT ACTUALLY WENT TO HELP- CREATE JOBS. AND LOOKING INTO THAT IT'LL BE INTERESTING FOR ME TO SEE IF THAT SAME- CONCEPT THAT WE USED TO CREATE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINERY IN OPERATION ON. THE RUNNING OF THAT EQUIPMENT. WILL ALSO- TRANSLATE INTO THIS- TECHNOLOGY AS WELL BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW MAINTAINING THOSE. AUTOMOBILES ARE JOBS AND- OPERATING THEM EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DRIVER THEY STILL REQUIRE- A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ASSEMBLY MAINTENANCE AND- AND OPERATION EITHER THROUGH REMOTE MEANS. SO AT THAT'LL BE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT AS THIS BILL ADVANCES WHAT IF IT DOES TODAY- THAT'LL BE- SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WITH RELATION TO THIS BILL. CENTER HERTZBERG COULD YOU WANNA I DID THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A SPECIFIC COMMENT ABOUT THIS BILL BUT MORE BROADLY AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS LARGER DISCUSSION OF. A TRANSITION. YOU KNOW HERE'S ANOTHER BILL WE'RE GONNA WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN VEHICLE CHARGING STATION INFRASTRUCTURE SET FORTH. ON PAGE SIX. LINE TWENTY SEVEN THE ITALICIZED NEW LANGUAGE WELL THE REALITY IS THAT AND IT'S JUST KIND OF FACES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GETS INCLUDED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. WE'VE GOTTA CONVERT THESE TRANSFORMERS WE'VE GOT TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE THIS STUFF AND SO WE TIME AND TIME AGAIN OUR SENIOR PLAN SMALL BALL AROUND THESE REAL ELEMENTS AND THE BASIC BACKBONE OF THIS CONVERSION NEEDS TO BE BUILT. AND I JUST THINK AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS MOVEMENT FORWARD I DON'T WANT TO EVER FORGET AND I'M GONNA REPEAT EVERY DISCUSSION IN THIS COMMITTEE AND BEYOND. THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REALLY IS REQUIRED IF WE'RE GONNA DO IS SIGNIFICANT CONVERSION TO ELECTRICITY AND THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT TAKES AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE AS A LEGISLATURE ENGAGED IN THIS. STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOCUS ON THAT CLEARLY WE CAN IT IS NICE TO HAVE MORE CHARGING STATIONS BUT AT SOME POINT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WON'T HANDLE IT AND WE'VE GOT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT. TO THE DISCUSSION. RIGHT THANK YOU AND- SAID REPUTED YOU WANT SPEAK. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THIS IS A BILL THAT WAS A LITTLE ALSO OFFERS CONFUSING TO MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED TO ALSO BE VERY. RESPECTFUL MINDFUL THAT LABOR FEDERATION AND TEACHERS ARE OPPOSE HOUSE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT AS WELL. IN TERMS OF JOBS THAT I DID SPEAK TO THE AUTHOR AND HE WAS. REASSURING US THAT- IT WILL NOT GET RID OF ANY JOBS BUT I ALSO WANTED TO INTERESTS ON THE BROADER CONVERSATION AS SOME. OF THE GOOD SENATOR FROM- SAN FERNANDO STATED I THINK ALSO THE BROADER CONVERSATION AS IT PERTAINS TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IS. THAT WE NEED TO ALWAYS CONSIDER THAT- WHEN THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WE FEEL THAT JOBS ARE BEING COMPROMISED THAT WE- CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND HOW DO WE BRING THE WORK FORCE ALONG WITH US I KNOW IT'S- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS HEADED AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF WE DO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS DIRECTION THAT WE SIT DOWN WITH ALIEF- FEDERATION AND- THE TEAMSTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE. AND WE NEED TO BRING THEM ALONG WITH US AND MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS CONTINUE TO BE THERE FOR THE WORK FORCE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY HOWEVER MOST BY MOTION CENTER RUBIO AND THE- MOTIONS TO PASS TO TRANSPORTATION. AND IF WE CAN- CLICK CALL THE ROLL PLEASE JUST DON'T HOW DID YOU WANT ABLE TO SEE THE AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE REPLY APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION VERY MUCH I DO I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TO MY FRIENDS- THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE- INCLUDING THE CAR CONSTRUCTION BUT BUT ALSO THE CHARGING OF STRUCTURES IS CONSTRUCTED USING UNION LABOR- SO THERE'S SOME JOB CREATION OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR GOOD UNION- WELL PAID JOBS BUT WITHOUT AYE WRISTS AYE I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. FRIEDMAN HAVE MORE WITH MEMBERS- AND RESPECT SESSION ABOUT. PLEASE FOLLOW. SB FOUR TWELVE FIFTY EIGHT BY SENATOR ALLEN DO PASSED TO TRANSPORTATION WESSEL. WESSELS HI DOLLY.

THE BILL IS THAT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF THE FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL ITEM TWO SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE BY CENTER- NEWMAN A BILL SLATED TO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS CENTER WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER MEMBERS I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF HIS FEET THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN ONGOING ALLOCATION OF AT LEAST THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM FUNDING OVER THE NEXT DECADE IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE BUILD OUT OF A STATE WIDE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN EQUITY FOCUSED FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING FUELING NETWORK. BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME FIRST THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT AND COMMIT TO ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD RENDON CLARITY ON DEFINITIONS AND ROLES AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA IS NOW FULLY COMMITTED TO THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF MOVING BEYOND GASOLINE POWERED AUTOMOBILES BY THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO TRANSITION CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FLEET. OF MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION VEHICLES AT A PACE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS. IT'S A GENERALLY ACCEPTED FACT THAT RELYING EXCLUSIVELY ON BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALONE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. TO GET US THERE BY THEN. WHAT BATTERY ELECTRIC CARS ARE WONDERFUL AND STEADILY GAINING IN BOTH PROMINENCE IN MARKET SHARE THEY ARE ENFORCING NOT NECESSARILY WELL SUITED. TO EVERYONE OR APPEALING TO EVERYBODY PARTICULAR APARTMENT DWELLERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUTERS TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES. OR DELIVERY DRIVERS WERE RIGHT TO WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR A BATTERY TO RECHARGE AS CORROBORATING EVIDENCE A SURVEY CONDUCTED LAST YEAR BY THE UC DAVIS INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION. FOUND THAT ROUGHLY A FIFTH OF OWNERS OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES- DECIDE TO SWITCH BACK TO GASOLINE POWERED ENGINES WHEN BUYING. THEIR NEXT CAR. IF IT'S TRUE THEN THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MEET EITHER ARE IN ROOM OUR ULTIMATE GOALS AROUND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ADOPTION THROUGH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALONE. WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO ENABLE THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONLY OTHER COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ZERO EMISSIONS ON MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR FCEV FCEV PLATFORM. AS YOU'RE ALL PROBABLY WELL AWARE AS A MATTER OF POLICY CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT FOR INVESTMENTS IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NEUTRAL AND NOT ADOPT ANYONE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE FUEL OR TECHNOLOGY POLICY HOWEVER HAS NOT ALWAYS FULLY TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE. TO DATE ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS PUBLIC INVESTORS HAVE PRIORITIZE THE BUILD OUT OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS NOT ENJOYED A CORRESPONDING LEVEL OF SUPPORT. THAT TIME. CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY. LESS THAN 4% OF TOTAL FUEL INTEREST SPENDING FOR THE BUIL OUT. OF THE PLAN STATEWIDE HARSH IN FUELING STATION NETWORK FOR BOTH LIGHT DUTY OR PASSENGER VEHICLES AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. THE ABSENCE OF A COMPLETE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTED STATEWIDE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK REPRESENTS A PRIMARY BARRIERS TO THE MARKET VIABILITY WIDESPREAD CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. OF A PROMISING CLASS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT ALSO SENDS A POWERFUL NEGATIVE SIGNAL TO AUTOMAKERS CURRENTLY OFFERING WERE CONSIDERING OFFERING NON POLLUTING ZERO CARBON. FUEL EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE FC VIS IN THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOBILE MARKET. ENSURING THAT HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS ARE WITH A USEFUL RADIUS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR WHOM THE EV'S MAY NOT YET MAKES SENSE TO COMMUTE DISTANCES. WORK PATTERNS HOUSING DENSITY OR LACK OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO CRITICAL TO REACHING BOTH OUR DECARBONISATION AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE WILL REAFFIRM HYDROGEN AS A PART OF CALIFORNIA CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND PLACE OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WITHIN REACH WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. THE STATE WILL BE ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT ONGOING FUNDING TO ACCELERATE THE BUILD OUT OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE HARJIT FUELING NETWORK. BEYOND TWO HUNDRED STATIONS MOVING TOWARD A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FUELING NETWORK THAT MEETS THE SELF SUFFICIENCY THRESHOLD IS LAID OUT. IN THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB EIGHT REPORT. TO THE ORGANIZATION TO RICHARD OPPOSITION I WOULD SAY RESPECTFULLY. THERE IS NOT YET TRYING TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE RACE TO DECARBONIZE OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTION.HI JUNE IS NOT ONLY A FIVE ONE ULTIMATELY PROMISING TO OPTION FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. IT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ANY REALISTIC AND EFFECTIVE PLAN THAT WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS OVERALL ZERO EMISSIONS GOALS. IMPORTANTLY SB THIRTEEN TWENTY ON ALSO PROVIDES AT LEAST 60% OF THE FUNDING SHALL BE USED FOR PROJECTS TO COMPLETELY. OR PARTIALLY BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THAT ALL CONSTRUCTION FUNDING WILL BE FUNDED WILL BE DONE BY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE FOR THESE REASONS I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE TODAY NUMBER RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY OR THERESA COOK THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA HUNDRED COALITION. AND ADAM BRAY ALI FELLOW HI JINKS DRIVER. AND ADVOCATE. THIS YOU HAVE TO PRISON INSTEAD WITH AN ORGANIZED PRESENTATION WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THOSE INTO SO EACH WILL GET UP IN A MINUTE AND A HALF BEGINNING WITH TERESA COOK THANK YOU SENATOR AND SHARON MEMBERS- THE- THREE SCOPE WITH CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLE ENSURING EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA URBAN AND RURAL WHETHER YOU HAVE A HOME AND OWN IT OR YOU RENT AN APARTMENT OR IF YOU PARK ON THE STREET. OR WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THE 13% OF CALIFORNIANS THAT QUALIFIES SUPER COMMUTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AS IT STANDS NOW THE STATE WILL AND ITS HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK AT TWO HUNDRED STATIONS AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION INVESTED TO THAT AND BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE INSURERS THE BUILD OUT OF A STATE WIDE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE GROWING FLEET OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC AS LESS THAN 4% OF SEVEN SPENDING IS GOING TOWARD HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE FIRST CC WORKSHOP TO STATION COMPLETION THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS CAN TAKE UP TO FIVE YEARS SO WITH YOUR SUPPORT OF THREE. EIGHTY NINE TODAY CALIFORNIA WILL BE WELL POSITIONED NOT ONLY TO EXPAND THE NETWORK OF FUEL CELL VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY READY TO SUPPORT THE THIRD WAVE OF VEHICLES MANY IN THE MEDIUM DUTY SPACE COMING FROM AUTO MAKERS LIKE DOGS VOLVO AND OTHERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS NOW WILL GO TO ADAM BRAY ALL LEAVE MINUTE AND A HALF UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN. HELLO MY NAME IS ADAM BRALEY AND EVEN THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA WHICH IS JUST EAST OF LOS ANGELES IN THE STATE SENATE DISTRICT OF SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO- I'M PERSONALLY. NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY COMPANY OR GROUP. INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS FOR THIS BILL. RATHER AN AVID SUPPORTER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALL TYPES AND ROUTE. WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME AND HEAR SOMEBODY BACK THERE- AND WE CAN. GO OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN. ONE JUST AFTER I'M PROUD THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STATE. I THINK THE BEST STATE THAT LEADS THE NATION IN THE WORLD IN SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVES TO GASOLINE CARS. BUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I'VE BEEN DRIVING A FUEL CELL CAR FOR MY DAILY USE AND I USE IN MY BUSINESS IS A REAL ESTATE AGENT HERE LOCALLY. I TYPICALLY TRAVEL FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ROUTINE PARKING OR NO PARKING SPACES THAT HAVE BATTERY CHARGER SO. IF YOU ALSO SYSTEM REALLY WORKS PARTICULARLY WELL FOR ME. AND THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY REFUELLING DRIVERS ARE EMISSIONS FROM. THOSE CARS TRULY AMAZING STEP FORWARD FROM THE BATTERY ELECTRIC CARS BAKER FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TEN. TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WHERE I HAD A REAL DEPENDENCE ON LONGER CHARGING TIMES AND BOTTLENECKS CHARGING STATIONS. I HEARD A DISCUSSION OF THE EARLIER BILL THE QUESTION ABOUT. BUILDING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR. BATTERY ELECTRIC CAR CHARGERS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND- I THINK THE FUEL CELL SYSTEMS OPERATE IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT. EXPANSIVE GROWTH. WITHOUT BOTTLENECKS THAT YOU MIGHT BE AWARE OF. SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE THE SENATE AND THE STATE TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING FUEL CELL VEHICLES BY PRISON FUNDING. TO BUILD MORE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REFUEL HYDROGEN CARS LONGER TERM TO REALLY PROMISING TECHNOLOGY. WE CAN SAFELY AND SUSTAINABLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR AIR QUALITY. ALLOW FORMER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS TIME IS UP. WE'RE GONNA. MOVE NOW FOR- SPEAKERS IS. OF THE BILL- BUT THEY COULD PLAY LIMIT COM. TO THEIR NAME. POSITION ON MEASURES. TO HAVE ANYBODY HERE IN THE CHAMBERS YES GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MIKE MONEY GONNA BE HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT.

FIVE FIFTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF TOYOTA SUPPORT. NEXT ONE MOMENT FOR ANOTHER LINE NUMBER. MY FIFTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIS IS MARK BROUGHT MORE TO SWITCH COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES IN STRONG SUPPORT. WE HAVE NO FURTHER LINES IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE OKAY NOW WILL MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE A- A LEAD OPPOSITION SPEAKER CHRISTIAN COURT BE- WITH CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. IS CHRISTIAN CORBIN HERE ON THE LINE. YES HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN CORBY AND I AM THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS COUNTY THE- AND- KELLY TO SEE HAS AN OPPOSE POSITION FOR REASONS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HOWEVER WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO TAKE WE'RE- INCLINED TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE SP THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. WITH ONE OF REMAINING RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE DRAFT AMENDMENTS WHICH IS TO HAVE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD COORDINATE WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DETERMINE. NUMBER PUBLIC HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS NEEDED- AND THIS WOULD MAKE THE BILL CONSISTENT WITH EIGHTY EIGHT. I WANT TO THANK THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN NSURE HUESO FOR LISTENING IN ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE SEEK APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR ALL ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL GO TO- SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION HERE IN THE GALLERY TO HAVE ANYONE. IN THE GALLERY I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. IF NOT WE'LL GO TO THE MODERATOR MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE KEY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. TO SB THIRTY TWENTY NINE.

RESEARCHERS I SUGGESTED AGAIN GLAD EXCEPT AMENDMENTS ONE OF OUR MANY MOVIE FORD. OKAY SO WE'LL GO ON TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS CENTER HERTZBERG. WE HAVE A MOTION SHERMAN I I'M I'M JUST WANT TO SAY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL A PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF IT AND- BUT WE IF WE WANNA MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN THIS STATE MAYBE OUR RELIANCE ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS THE WAY TO GT IT DONE BUT- I THINK IF WE'RE LOOKING TO SCALE THIS OP ONE BILLION CARS I JUST DON'T KNOW. THAT THERE'S ENOUGH WITH HIM OUT THERE FOR US TO GET TO THAT POINT HI THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I THINK WE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE WANT TO LEAD WE HAVE TO TAKE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH WE HAVE TO BE DIVERSE IN THE TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE INVEST IN AND SO I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF BILL WE NEED HYDROGEN HAS A LOT OF PROMISE. IT MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER TO IT BUT IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE WAY WE GET ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER AT TWENTY. GET SOME CLARIFICATION I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOUR SON THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT. THE BILL PROHIBITS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FROM ACQUIRING A MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL SUPPLIER TO CONSTRUCTOR FUND- PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE HYDROGEN STATION SO IN OTHER WORDS. THE BILL IN ADDITION TO THIS THE FUNDING INCENTIVES AND CODIFYING THE GOAL IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT'S THE PROVISION THAT'S MOST TROUBLING TO ME BECAUSE WHEN WE PASS ON A TWO THIRDS VOTE THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND RE APPROVE THE SMOG FEE IN THE VEHICLE FEE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FEES THAT FUND THESE PROGRAMS. PART OF THE DEAL STRUCK THERE THAT I THINK THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY SWALLOWED HARD ON BUT BUT DEALT WITH IT WAS THAT EXEMPTION THAT. THE OIL INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE HYDROGEN STATIONS THAT WOULD SORT OF ALL BE PUBLICLY FUNDED. BUT UNLESS WE HAVE THAT BROADER COMPROMISE AROUND THIS THIS FRAMEWORK. IN OTHER WORDS WITH THAT OIL INDUSTRY EXEMPTION HERE BUT NOT THE BROADER SORT OF FEE RE AUTHORIZATION WHICH I KNOW THE COLDEST MINUS BILLS EXCITED ABOUT AND WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER ON BUT- THAT PROVISION IN PARTICULAR FEELS LIKE. YOU'RE NOT PULLING A KEY SORT OF BARGAINING PEACE OFF THE TABLE WITHOUT. SORT OF FIGURING OUT THE REST OF FRAMEWORK SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR WANTS TO. COMMENT ON THAT OR- COMMITTEE I MAY HAVE MISSED TWO IN THE AMENDMENTS. YEAH IF IT'S STRICKEN THEN IT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT IT I CAN'T SEE FROM THE AMENDMENTS OR FROM THE BILL THAT HAS BEEN STRICKEN SO MY PRESUMPTION HERE IS THAT WE'RE VOTING ON A BILL THAT MAINTAINS THAT EXEMPTION FOR THE- FOR THE OIL SUPPLIERS SAID MY GETTING THAT RIGHT THROUGH THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR. OKAY MIGHT MAYBE NOT THROUGH THE CHAIR MAYBE THE AUTHOR. I DON'T SEE IT IN ANY OF THE- AMENDED LANGUAGE IT IS JONES A MISS COOK- URUS. YOU MAY MAYBE THE SPONSORS IS TO RESTRUCTURE YEAH. THANK THERE WE GO OKAY. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT THANK YOU SENATOR TERESA COOK THAT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION- SENATOR STERN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY COMMITTEE TODAY DO NOT STRIKE THE REFERENCE TO THE CLEAN FUELS OUTLET. HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON NOT ADVOCATE YOUR SAID. YES SO THIS SENATORS THE INDUSTRY WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM ANY CARBON FORSMAN AUTHORITY THAT'S CORRECT OPEN TO SOME OF THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS BILL AND I THINK WE DO WANT TO STILL FULFILL THE BIGGER VISION AROUND THE TWO HUNDRED STATIONS AND SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE ALMOST THERE MAY BE WERE EIGHTEEN AWAY OR SORT OF SHORT BUT- THAT PIECE I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH BUT- THAT PROVISION AND I BELIEVE IT'S ON PAGE THREE- IN SECTION ONE B. SO IT'S FORTY THREE OH. ONE EIGHT POINT NINETY I CAN'T VOTE ON THE MEASURE WITH THAT IN THERE RIGHT NOW SO- YEAH APOLOGIES I'M I'M IF THE AUTHORS OPEN HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH IT BUT- THAT FEELS TO ME LIKE. TAKEN A VERY IMPORTANT PROTECTION WE'VE GOT IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT- AND JUST GIVING IT AWAY FOR FREE. ENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH pAT LENGTH WITH THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE HIS- YOU KNOW JUST BEING ABLE TO DEBATE THIS THIS ISSUE I WILL ACTUALLY SEE THIS BILL IN MY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE- SOON SO I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT AT THE AT THE FRONT OF IT- WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION- THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS OBVIOUSLY LIMITED FUNDS- THE SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND SO RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS AND THERE HAVE BEEN DEBATES ABOUT REALLY RE INSTATING THE FUNDS- AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S AN EQUITY COMPONENT IN THIS BUT RUN SURE AS OF NOW ON THE FUNDING IN THE MECHANISM FOR THE FUNDING SO WITHOUT THAT- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- AND WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN- REINSTATE THE FUND AND IF WE DO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- IN ADDITION TO OUR EFFORTS THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A MISSION. INTELLIGENCE OF THANK YOU. SEVEN NINE SERVICES WELL AT ANYONE ELSE. LOOK IN THE COMMITTEE WILL COME BACK. TO THE AUTHOR WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER HERTZBERG. OF APPROVED WITH AMENDMENTS DID YOU WANNA MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER SAID TO SENATOR DOES I CAN DIE DO APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN IS TO. HOW WE ALLOCATE LIMITED RESOURCES I THINK UNITED WE THAT WE NEED TO RE AUTHORIZE THE CLEAN TRANSLATION FUNDING- THAT SOME APPRECIABLE LEVEL I THINK THE STATE'S FISCAL POSITION- AND ALSO THE YOU KNOW BUT SHALL APPROACH WILL SUPPORT THAT- TO SEND RESTAURANTS POINT WITH THE NUMBER OF STATIONS IT'S IT IS IN FACT NOT TRUE- THAT WE'RE HEADED. QUICKLY TWO HUNDRED AND THIS IS IN FACT THE BASIS OF THIS BILL. WHAT WE'RE DOING TO DO HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO EXACTLY- WHAT SEEMS TO CONCERN. SO THE OPPONENT THE OPPOSITION- IS TO CREATE STRANDED ASSETS WE'RE AT A POINT RIGHT NOW IN THE EVOLUTION. OF THIS. VERY IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. AGAIN AS I STATED I THINK IS MOST PEOPLE ACCEPT THAT WE CANNOT GET. TO A TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS WITHOUT GIVING CONSUMERS AT LEAST TWO OPTIONS. ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS NECESSARILY.HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND TO DO THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS STATIONS THAT ARE PROPERLY DISTRIBUTED. THAT ARE WITHIN EASY REACH. OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL ENDEAVORS TO DO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH EVERYBODY ASSIST MOVES FORWARD IT'S ESPECIALLY WITH LIKE FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WITH THAT. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. VERY WELL- CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION.

THAT IS AN APPROACH TO GET OUT OF THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WILL COME TO ITEM NUMBER THREE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY CENTER CORTESE A BILL RELATING TO ELECTRICITY AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSING LOCAL SOLAR PROGRAM WELCOME SENATOR PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BUT TODAY I'M HERE BILL THAT WILL EXTEND SOLAR ACCESS TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE SOUL REVOLUTION PUT. MORE SOLAR AND STORAGE ON THE GRID AT AN ACCELERATED RATE. THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS A CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE PROGRAM THE NET ENERGY MEET METERING PROGRAM THE ROOFTOP SOLAR MARKET HAS GROWN. HOWEVER STRIKINGLY LOW PERCENTAGE OF THESE FUNDS WERE RESERVED FOR LOW INCOME TENANTS IN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY TWENTY STUDY BY THE LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY ONLY ABOUT TWO PERCENT. OF RESIDENTIAL SOLAR SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED A MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. THIS DATA IS EVEN MORE ALARMING LOOKING AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF LOCAL SOLAR DISTRIBUTION WE SHOW THAT AROUND HALF OF THE STATE'S SOLAR ADOPTERS ARE IN THE HIGHEST 20% OF EARNERS. ONLY 4% COME FROM THE LOWEST 20% THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS IN THE PAST REACH THIS POPULATION SUCH AS THE MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE SORE HOUSING PROGRAM. KNOWN AS MASH IN THE SOLAR ON MULTIFAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING- OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SOMA PROGRAM. YET THESE ONLY SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM SOLAR AND REDUCE ENERGY BILLS. THE L. A. O. ESTIMATES THAT OVER THREE MILLION. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THREE MILLION. READ HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND WE CAN ASSUME THAT A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AT ITS FULL CAPACITY THE SUMMER PROGRAM WOULD REACH APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THE THREE MILLION. WITH THE PRICES OF ENERGY INCREASING AND CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS BECOMING MORE MORE DEVASTATING. THE STATE MUST TAKE MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO REDUCING ENERGY BILLS FOR LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS AND GETTING SOLAR AND STORAGE ON THE GRID AT AN ACCELERATED RATE. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WITH THE CHI THIS GOAL BY CREATING A PROGRAM. THAT ASKS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO BUILD AND OPERATE. OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR AND STORAGE PROVIDE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WITH BILL CREDITS IN PROVIDE RESILIENCY TO THE GRID WITHOUT SHIFTING COSTS TO NON PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT USE REPAIR FUNDS. INVOLVED NO COST SHIFT REPAIRS NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. WITH A MEMBERS SET TO SHARE RECOMMENDED. WE WILL CLARIFY AND ENSURE THAT ALL COSTS WOULD BE BORNE EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH A PORTION OF THE REVENUES TO BE GENERATED BY THE PROJECT THROUGH SALE OF ENERGY AND CAPACITY. ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHTED THIS BILL IN NO WAY WOULD IMPEDE THE SUMMER PROGRAM. OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM FROM CONTINUE TO OPERATE APARTMENT OWNERS CAN CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMA RATHER THAN THIS PROGRAM. OR CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AT ALL IF THAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE. I LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME EXTENSIVELY ON THIS BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO COMMIT TO TAKING AMENDMENTS. TO NUMBER ONE REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. WITH REQUIRED EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM AT THE FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT MARC. PROHIBIT ENROLLMENT IN BOTH THE SOMA AND THE PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THIS BILL. SO NO SIMULTANEOUS ENROLLMENT. IN THREE ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO COST IMPACT PARTICIPATING OR NOT PARTICIPATING CUSTOMERS. WITHOUT SAID. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE- IN LET ME- IDENTIFY THE WITNESSES- MR CHER. HERE TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE TODAY IS SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE MARK JOSEPH ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES TO ASSIST WITH ANSWERING QUESTIONS- I BELIEVE MR WHICH IS HERE IN- MISTER JOSEPH WOULD BE ON THE PHONE LINE AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY SO YOU WANT THOSE TWO SPEAKERS MARK JOSEPH AND SCOTT WHICH I HAVEN'T BOTH HERE IN MY LIST TOTAL BE A MINUTE AND A HALF EACH BEGINNING WITH SCOTT WHICH- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACTUALLY SCOTT WHICH- I'LL BE TESTIFYING ON. BEHALF OF BOTH THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION. HE TOLD THE EMPLOYEES MISTER JOSEPH IS AVAILABLE IF THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT ARISE. MEMBERS IT'S TIME THAT WE BRING EQUITY TO THE STATE'S SOLAR PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA'S SOLAR INITIATIVE THE CSI PROGRAM SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. TO BUILD TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. LESS THAN 7% OF THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME HOUSING. OR OR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING TO DATE WE'VE BUILT TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NET METERING UNDER THE NET STATES NET METERING PROGRAM TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS HAS GONE TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ORDER AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING IT IS SHAMEFUL. THIS IS AN APPROACH BY SENATOR CORTESE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BUILD UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR TARGETED AT CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO ALL THESE PROGRAMS BUT RECEIVING NOTHING IN RETURN. WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT A COST SHIFT. IT'S ALLOWING A WHOLE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION TO ENJOY THE SOLAR REVOLUTION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED THE BERKELEY SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL BUSINESS LAST YEAR PUT OUT A REPORT THAT SHOWED EVEN WHEN YOU ADJUSTED FOR INCOME. BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO SOLAR DENSITY. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN REDLINED. THAT THE UTILITIES AND OTHER CUSTOMERS VERY WELL THEY CAN IDENTIFY ECONOMICALLY THE TARGETED AUDIENCE AND DELIVER THE ROOFTOP SOLAR. IN RESPONSE THE SO MY PROGRAM WE SUPPORT THE SO SOMEONE PROGRAM BUT IT'S ONLY GOING TO BUILD THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS AS THE CENTER SAID THAT JUST SCRATCHES THE SURFACE. WE THINK THAT THIS COMPLIMENTS DOESN'T TAKE AWAY AND WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS VERY MODEST EQUITY EQUITY BILL THANK YOU. I'LL LET YOU TO GO OVER IN TIME BECAUSE I WAS INFORMED THAT MARC JOSEPH IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN. BACK REGARDING THE SOLAR PROGRAM THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SO MY PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT PROGRAM TARGETS BUILDINGS AND THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM TARGETS RATE PAYERS. IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMER PROGRAM YOU NEED TO BE A BUILDING A PROJECT OWNER APARTMENT OWNER. WITH EIGHTY DEED RESTRICTED PROPERTY WELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DON'T LIVE IN DEED RESTRICTED BUILDINGS SO WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER FOLKS WHO MEET THE ECONOMIC THRESHOLD THAT WERE TARGETING WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO THESE PROGRAMS BUT NOT ENJOYING ANY BENEFIT RATHER THAN TARGETING APARTMENT OWNERS. WE'RE TRYING TO TARGET THE REPAIRS SO WE ARE URGING A VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL GO TO- ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN THE GALLERY IN SUPPORT AND THE SPEAKERS- MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ANYONE OKAY WE'LL GO TO THE MODERATOR MODERATOR PLEASE Q.

WE HAVE NO FOR THE LINES IN Q. IN OPPOSITION OF SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE OKAY NOW COME TO THE COMMITTEE TO ANY MEMBERS WISH TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS- CENTER EGGMAN. MISTER CHAIR- IN THANK YOU TO THE TO THE CENTER I JUST. SO WE'VE HEARD FOM A LOT OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES AND AS MENTIONED BEFORE- THE SUMMER PROGRAM. IT WHICH STARTING BIG STATEWIDE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AND AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT TRY TRY LOOKING AT ALL ARE HOMELESS PROGRAMS BUT WHEN WE START BIG PROGRAMS LIKE THE CITY A COUPLE OF YEARS TO COME ON AND I CAN SAVE MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUMMER PROGRAM. AUTHOR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE COME ONLINE UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN AND STARTED GETTING ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND IT IS THE PROGRAM BY ALL REPORTS IS DOING VERY WELL AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT PROGRAM WAS FOR THE BENEFITS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS WHAT. WHAT THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO DO ON THE ROOFTOPS NOW THIS TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ANNA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. IT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY- BUT I THINK THE REDUNDANCY- IN AND I THINK AS- IT. ARE I THINK IT IS POINTED OUT HERE THE SAVINGS TO THE ACTUAL. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR POCKET FOR THEIR UTILITIES WILL NOT BE AS REDUCE WITH THIS AS THIS IS UTILITY DRIVEN AND- IN FRONT OF THE METER VERSES. ON THE ROOFTOPS WHICH WERE STILL TRYING TO MEET THAT GOAL OF HOW MANY WE CAN GET UP ON THE ROOF TOPS SO. FOR THOSE REASONS AND I WILL. BUT LIKE TO CONDEMN AGAIN IF THIS MOVES FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR ALL TO OCCUR BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW- TO START. AND SOMETHING NEW THAT'S UTILITY DRIVEN AND NOT GOING DIRECTLY. TO LOW INCOME HOUSING AND WE KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED IS TO MAKE. WELL HOUSING PROJECTS PENCIL OUT. AT ALL THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USED. TO BENEFIT- THOSE WHO WERE LIVING IN THE HOUSE- IT'S COMPLICATED SO. FOR THAT REASON I WILL NOT BE ABLE SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT IF IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE- CENTER REVIEW I WILL ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE- WITH MY CALLING FROM STOCKTON YOU KNOW IS- YOU KNOW PREPARE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF RESERVATIONS- AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAVINGS SAID WORCESTER DATE EXPRESS AND I KNOW THAT THIS SENATOR WAS THE AUTHOR WITH THE ORIGINAL BILL AND SHE- I. MEAN WE HAD A CONVERSATION PRIOR TO THE TO THE CENTER PRESS ANY RIGHT NOW AND- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WORRY ABOUT IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU. SEE THAT COALITION OF PEOPLE SPEAKING UP ON THIS BILL AGAINST THIS BILL IS. YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH THOSE ADVOCATES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHICH REALLY CONCERNS ME- BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THIS TO THE SENATOR I WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL NOW JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT IT AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT PRICE DOWN BUT A LOT OF CONCERNS HAVE COME TO ME THE LAST TWO HOURS AS WE ALL KNOW WE WEREON BREAK AND- WE JUST CAME BACK THIS MORNING AND SO IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO TAKE. UP WITH THAT IT'S GOING ON BUT- I DO WANT IF I MAY ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS CONCERNING THAT THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES MAY NOT. GET THE BENEFIT AND- YOU KNOW IS EXPRESSED EARLIER BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS AT MAY DILUTE THE FUNDS ARE YOU AVAILABLE- AND- I WOULD WANT SOMETHING TO WORK WHILE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT THE CENTER FROM STOCKTON WAS. EXPLAINING THAT TO HER BILL TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET GOING. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH A SHE STATED AND I AGREE. BUT I JUST WANT ENCOURAGE MORE CONVERSATION AND RELIEF- DISCUSS HOW TO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES BENEFIT FROM THE SOUTH. AGAIN SENATOR I WILL SUPPORTER RIGHT NOW BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT THANK YOU. CENTER HERTZBERG DID YOU HAVE YOUR MAKE UP I DID. I DID I JUST WANT TO CHECK. I KNOW THAT THE MOMENT MISS. MAKE SOME COMMENT ABOUT THE- THE SUMMER PROGRAM. BUT I WANT TO GET SOME CLEAR CUT EXPLANATION OF. THE AUTHOR. BECAUSE YOU SOME ISSUE HERE ABOUT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUMMER PROGRAM. AND THE PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THIS LEGISLATION. YEAH THIS THIS SO LET'S SOLUTION DOESN'T IMPACT OR INTERFERE WITH A SUMMER PROGRAM AT ALL TO- PARAPHRASE- THE LEAD- SUPPORT WITNESS- WE LIKE THE SUMMER PROGRAM THE SUMMER PROGRAM. IS NARROWLY DEFINED AND TARGETED DEED RESTRICTED UNITS WHICH ARE A FRACTION OF ALL. OF LOW INCOME UNITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S NOT BAD. BUT IT'S A THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATT PROGRAM. THAT BY LAW. BY THE ACTION OF. OF A GOOD BILL THAT CAME FORWARD BEFORE. EARLY TAYLOR'S- THAT APPROACH A TO DEED RESTRICTED UNITS- THERE IS- A HUGE PIE UNFORTUNATELY OUT THERE OF NON DEED RESTRICTED UNITS WHICH ARE LOW INCOME- WHICH- NEED. NEED SOLAR THE ROOFTOP SOLAR WHICH IS BILL DOES ALLOW FOR BY THE WAY OR- NOT ROOFTOP SOLAR- IN. IN IN EACH CASE- IT'S A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODEL IN THAT. THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE TO PAY IN BUILT IN THE OF THE THEY HAVE THE SKILL TO DO THAT- THE OF THE LIBERTY TO DO THAT- BUT RETURN FIFTY PERCENT. OF ALL EARLY. OFF THE GRID RIGHT BACK TO THOSE LOW INCOME TENANTS UNIT BY UNIT BY UNIT- SO. SIMILAR OUTCOME PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EITHER IN EITHER PROGRAM THAT LOW INCOME TENANTS. FINALLY GET THE ADVANTAGES OF SOLAR- BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH IN TERMS OF BUSINESS MODEL AND ONE THEY'RE BOTH THEY'RE BOTH OFTEN PROGRAMS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER DOESN'T AGREE TO HAVE EITHER OF THESE PROGRAMS IF IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN- SO I THINK THAT'S THE BEST EXPLANATION I CAN. HAS REMOVED MR A TO MOVE NOW IT HAS HASN'T ITEM OF THE BILL THANK YOU. OKAY SO THAT EMOTIONS HERTZBERG. YES THAT'S A MOTION DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OKAY DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS JUST A DAY TO CURRY- A SERIOUSLY THE REQUEST BY BY MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE UP ASKING THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK- WORK ON THE BILL RELATIVE TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY OPPOSITION- THIS THIS IS A BILL WHERE I THINK SOME OF THINGS WE HEARD EVEN FROM OPPOSITION TESTIMONY CAN BE ADDRESSED- CERTAINLY IF THIS IS SO MY PROGRAM NEEDS OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT IN SOME KIND OF N INFUSION IN THAT- I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT TO CONTINUE TO GROW THAT PROGRAM AS WELL WITHOUT IT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. VERY WELL OKAY- CLARK COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THE BILL WHICH INCLUDES THE MEN'S. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY SENATOR CORTESE. TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. WESSEL BY. WESSEL HI DOLLY. BAKER GORGEOUS DODD HI EGGMAN. EGGMAN NO GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ HI GROWN HERTZBERG. HERTZBERG I REQUIRE MCGUIRE FIVE MEN. MAN HI RUBIO. RUBIO HI STERN. AS CHAIR WITH ONE NOW HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF THE FRAPPES OF MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM FOUR SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE BY CENTER WILL COST YOU A BILL RELATED TO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE PILOT PROGRAM. A SINGLE CASK YOU WELCOME BECAUSE YOU READ SHERIFF THANK YOU. BELATED EASTER GREETINGS- I WANT TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO MAKE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM CONTINGENT UPON RECEIPT OF FUNDS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THINK YOUR CONSULTANT FOR WORKING ON THEM WITH MY OFFICE- BUT WITH REGARD TO. CHANGING WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE PROGRAM I'D LIKE TO KEEP S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY NINE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND BY CREATING THIS- CARBON CAPTURE GRANT PROGRAM IS C. ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THE S. B. C. RUNS AN EXPEDITED ONE STOP PERMITTING PROCESS FOR THERMAL POWER PLANTS WE ENVISION WELL CEMENT IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS WE ENVISION BIO FUELS- AND NATURAL GAS TO BE APPLICANTS HERE IN THE- YEAH THIS IS THEIR JURISDICTION AND IT CERTAIN POLISH BASS AND THEY WOULD BE. AN IDEAL OF LEAD. ALSO AN OUT THAT BILL TAKES WELL THE CDC'S LEAD- IT REQUIRES COORDINATION WITH CARB WITH CAL JAM WITH THE WATER RESOURCE FOR GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND OTHER GOVERNMENT BODIES- RELEVANT TO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THE IDEA IDEAS WE DO THREE PILOT PROGRAMS PARTIALLY FUND THE UP FRONT COST OF RETROFITTING PLANTS WITH CARBON CAPTURE SYSTEMS AND CREATE A TASK FORCE TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME TECHNICAL AND POLICY ASSISTANCE TO FILL OUT TO FILL THESE MANEUVERING THROUGH THE CARBON CAPTURE. A PERMITTING PROCESS IT'S SIX YOU KNOW THE BILL. AS BASIS WE HAD THE REPORT OF THE LIVERMORE LABS SAID SAID IF WE DID EVERYTHING WE WANTED TO WE GOT EVERYBODY STRIVE ELECTRIC CAR EVERYBODY'S GOT ELECTRIC SO WE GOT ALL THE- BUILDINGS DONE WE'RE STILL GONNA BE A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT METRIC TONS. SHORT PER YEAR AND WE DO DIRECTOR CARBON CAPTURE WE DE SEQUESTRATION NATURAL LANDS REDUCE CARBON CAPTURE SO. THIS BILL WITH THOSE FACILITIES ARE REQUIRE ARE ELIGIBLE WOULD REQUIRE MONITORING TO REDUCE CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS. EMITTED FROM THEIR- CCS- FIZZLED- RETROFITTED FACILITY AND INJECT ALL STORED STORED CARBON INTO A HIGH QUALITY GEOLOGICAL RESERVOIRS THIS IS MEANS THAT THERE'S NO ONE. IN HANDS WILL RECOVER WE KNOW THERE'S OPPOSITION THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WILL RECOVER BUT WE'RE LOOKING. ON A LIMITED BASIS TO THE- CO LOCATED HIGH QUALITY GEOLOGICAL- AREAS YOU KNOW WHERE IT CRITICAL STAGE IN. R. FOR CLIMATE FIGHT THE- REASON THAT CAME OUT FROM AYE PPC SAID THAT WE REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ONE POINT SIX. PERCENT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS IS AFTER WE READ REACHED THIRTY B. THIRTY TWO GOALS WE NEED TO GO AT A PACE OF FOUR POINT THREE. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO GO WITH SEVEN POINT 6% SO IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE- BALLOONING ACCUMULATION OF CO TWO EMISSIONS. AND IS UPON US THE REPORT FURTHER ON FURTHER SAYS THAT BY DELAYING CLIMATE ACTION AND A LACK OF NEGATIVE EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES MANY OF THESE NEGATIVE EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES RELY ON CARBON CAPTURE WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO MEET THE PROMISE OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT CALIFORNIA'S OWN MITIGATION STRATEGY AN EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS ALL OF. ALL OF OUR OFFERINGS AROUND THE PARIS ACCORD. WE GO FORWARD YOU KNOW THE MODELING FROM CAR SHOWS A CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TO RELY ON CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL IF IT HOPES TO REACH THE COMMON OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT. I THINK THE END END OF IT IS THAT WE CAN O LONGER TAKE CARBON CAPTURE OFF THE TABLE IF WE'RE GONNA FIGHT FOR OF CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE ON. THE WORLD THERE'S CURRENTLY A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE IT SCALE FACILITIES THREE THEIR OPERATIONAL AND IT BOARD ADVANCING CALIFORNIA HAS. CURRENTLY FIVE ANNOUNCED PROJECT NONE OF THEM OPERATIONAL. IT'S STANFORD IN THE ENERGY FUTURES INITIATIVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY REPORT ON CARBON CAPTURE ARGUED THAT A LACK OF STATE SUPPORT PERMITTING COMPLEXITY AND HIGH CAPITAL COSTS OF ALL ACTED AS BARRIERS TO THE- CCS SO. SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE BARRIERS THROUGH FUNDING AND CONTINUE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA REACHES AMBITION- EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AND I HAVE TO WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I WOULD URGE AN IPHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE HAVE TO- ORGANIZE PRESENTERS- AND SO WILL GIVE EACH OF THEM A MINUTE AND A HALF AS WE'VE BEEN GIVEN EVERYONE ELSE BEGINNING WITH DR SERRA SELTZER- FROM THE STANFORD CENTER FOR CARBON STORAGE- IS SHE HERE OR SHE ON THE LINE. YES I'M ONLINE GAMING YES YOU COULD BEGIN. GREAT OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND IF I RECENTLY COMPLETED A STUDY ON PCS OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE FINDINGS AND THEN ADDRESS HAD SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY NINE COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR CCS IN THE STATE. INDUSTRIAL AND ELECTRICITY SET. OVER HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR. IN OUR STUDY WE IDENTIFIED SEVENTY SIX SEPARATE SOURCES OF CAPTURE BOTH CO TWO EMISSIONS WHICH TOGETHER EMIT SIXTY MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR. CAPTURE COSTS RANGE FROM A LOW OF TWENTY DOLLARS A TONNE FOR ETHANOL. TO EIGHTY DOLLARS A TONNE ABOVE IT COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANTS. WE OFFER SAID STORAGE OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST GEOLOGICAL STORAGE POTENTIAL IN THE UNITED STATES. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TCS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HUGE BUT SO ARE THE CHALLENGES. EVEN WITH THE FEDERAL FORTY FIVE PACKS FORTY FIVE Q. TAX CREDIT AND THE UP THE ABOUT. CREDIT ON ELIGIBLE PROJECT. THE FINANCIAL AND PROJECT RISK IT USED FOR ANY ENTITIES TO CONSIDER TACKLING ON IT SO. STATE DEPORTED DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS COULD HELP OVERCOME THREE MAJOR PROJECT BARRIERS. HI AT RISK THE COSTS IN THE PROJECT EARLY STAGES. UNCLEAR AND UNTESTED REGULATION THROUGHOUT THE VALUE CHAIN OF THE GPS PROJECT. AND LACK OF PUBLIC. ACCEPTANCE OF PCS. AN IDEAL CANDIDATE SITES FOR A DEMO PROJECT WOULD BE LOCATED AT OR NEAR GOOD GEOLOGIC STORAGE MINIMIZING PROJECT COSTS AND COMPLEXITY. BY ELIMINATING. THE NEED FOR CO TWO TRANSPORTATION. A LEAD AGENCY COULD MANAGE THEM AND PROJECT IN CORE. WITH INDUSTRY. OUR DATA ON POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT COULD THEN BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PROVIDING VALUABLE LESSONS LEARNED FOR FUTURE CCS PROJECTS IN THE STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL HAVE NOW MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER IN SUPPORT FIELD SALES WITH CALPINE- THEO YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF REMEMBER CEO PAY US REPRESENT IN THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION. WE BELIEVE THIS% BILL ADDRESSES A CRITICAL NEED IN RECENT OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE KNOW FROM THE STATE'S ON MODELING THAT WE WILL BE STUCK WITH SOME OF THE SOURCES OF CARBON EMISSIONS WELL THREE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WHY WOULD WE TRY TO SEQUESTER THOSE CARBONS AS MUCH IS PROUD TO BE POSSIBLE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL PUTS THE STATE IN A GOOD POSITION TO GET COMPETITIVE GRANTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEREBY LEVERAGING OUR ABILITY TO BRING DOWN FOLLOWERS BELIEVE IT'S WORTHY OF SOME OF YOUR SUPPORT AND- WE SUPPORT SB THIRTY NINETY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- NOW WILL COME TO- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE SB THIRTEEN NINETY NINE IN THE GALLERY ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WHICH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SENATORS MICHAEL SMITH'S ON BEHALF OF RE CARBON A NEW INNOVATIVE OF A TRANSFORMATION OF A COMPANY THAT IS- IS STRONG IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. OKAY WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES NOW FOR SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THIRTEEN NINETY NINE AND AGAIN WE WANT TO ASK- THE SPEAKERS TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME.

OKAY VERY WELL WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY- CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- TRYING TO GET SOME CLARITY HERE ON THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT. WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WOULD AND WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE IF I COULD ASK A QUESTION OF THE OFF- CENTER. WHAT KASKY. YES WELL YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WHICH IS WHICH IS. AS LEGITIMATE CRITICISM IT DOESN'T GO ENOUGH BUT YOU WOULD HAVE- NATURAL GAS- SYSTEM. I'M GONNA SAY IS WRONG REESE ARE SET TOOL CYCLE TO CYCLE. AB BIOFUELS ETHANOL PLANTS THAT WOULD BE THEIR CEMENT CEMENT WOULD HAVE IT ANY INDUSTRIAL PLANT LIKE I'VE- HYDROGEN PLANTED THOSE WITH IT WAS AN INDUSTRIAL PLANT NOT A ENERGY PRODUCER WOULD BE ELIGIBLE THAT THAT. A STEEL PLANT I GUESS IF THEY'RE MAKING STEEL HERE BUT THEY COULD DO THAT TOO. HIGH A MATTER. SO IN OTHER WORDS THE PROJECT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION. BUT IT COULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY SO ALL OTHER KINDS OF FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION BESIDES ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PILOT I SEE SPELL IT I'D SAY EXISTING INDUSTRIAL FACILITY NATURAL GAS FACILITY. BIOMASS FACILITY BUT- THAT'S ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE ON THE SO FEET ALLOWING FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION BUT NOT ALLOWING EOR IS THAT A FAIR STRATEGIES. OKAY STRUGGLING WITH THAT- YEAH I KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO STAY LIMITED HERE IN SCOPE- IN TERMS OF THESE FIRST PILOTS AND OBVIOUSLY FOR INDUSTRY DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH FOR ME OU KNOW MY I WANT TO SEE SOME KIND OF. FOUNDRIES ARE PARAMETERS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SIDE I SEE THE PROVISION ABOUT REDUCING YOUR CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS. AND WANT THAT TO BE A LOT MORE RIGOROUS- OR SPECIFIC BEFORE I COULD. WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE JUST BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SAFEGUARDS I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BEING CITED IN HOT SPOT SIR. COMMUNITIES WITH EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I GET YOUR WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. DETAILS AND SORT OF. CUTS THROUGH A TRICKY POLITICAL. YOU KNOW LINE HERE BUT I'LL JUST RAISE THAT AS IS MY CURRENT CONCERN. OKAY VERY WELL ANYONE ELSE TO HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION- SERMON DID YOU WANNA MAKE COMMENTS. YES SO I'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONFLICTING THINGS ON THE VIABILITY OF CARBON CAPTURE AS I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT APPROACH- AS AS A SORT OF. THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT MATTER BUT- I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE OPPOSITION IS STATE CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL AND I WAS WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THEIR OPPOSITION AND IT WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM. THERE ARE A LOT OF FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE IF WE LET EVERYTHING USE CARBONCAPTURE THE- AT LEAST THE IPC REPORT IDENTIFIES SEVENTY SIX. WE'RE TRYING TO NARROW THAT INTO WERE THE RESERVOIR FOR THE WELL THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE IF THEY IN FACT IS GOING TO BE COLOCATED THERE THAT'S WHAT WE ONLY HAVE THREE IN THE PLANT NOW NOW SOME OF IT IF IT WORK. IN OF NANCY SKINNER HAS A BILL THAT ONLY FOCUSES ON ON CEMENT BUT CEMENT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT SO THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHERE THAT CEMENT PLANT WOULD BE TO A RESERVOIR PROBABLY NOT. COLOCATED SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE LIMIT- YOU KNOW WE- THE POTENTIAL IS GREAT I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF CARBON CAPTURE GOING AROUND. THE COUNTRY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT. BUDGET DEL INTO A TWO SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD. THROUGH THE BUDGET. PROCEDURE PUTS SOME MONEY IN THERE SO AT LEAST THESE. WORK COMPETITIVE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE BENEFIT IS THAT MIGHT MIGHT. ROSS THIS WAS THAT WE COULD TAKE. ADVANTAGE OF THE BEST PLACES NOT BETTER COMPROMISED BY EARTHQUAKES NOT A COMPROMISE THERE'S IT'S- A VERY MODEST STEP CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS SO MANY. LOCATIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE. AND SO YOU'RE A SAID I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ARE YOU WORKING WITH OPPOSITION THEN OR ARE YOU. TO TRY TO SWITCH YEAH YEAH I MEAN THE IDEA OF COURSE UNITED AGAIN I'M TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON SOMETHING THAT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND DOESN'T INCREASE. PARTICULATES IN THE AREA AND ACTUALLY REDUCES. REDUCES SAID. REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF CO TWO THAT'S IT'S OUT THERE FIRST IS DOING EVERYTHING AND WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO EVERYTHING I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL APPROACHING YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN SO WITH THAT I WILL SUPPORT. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR DODD DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS ARE WILL CASCADE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO TAKE MOMENT INTO THINKING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK ALONG WITH YOUR STAFF ON SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR AND OF COURSE I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY. AT MEMBERS SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WILL PROVIDE A PATH TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUNDING OF ELECTRIC UTILITY LINES IN THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONES IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THOSE LINES ARE MOST AT RISK FOR STARTING A WILDFIRE LET ME JUST BE PLAIN THIS BILL. IS GOING TO SAVE LIVES UNDER THIS APPROACH EMBEDDED IN THE LEGISLATION IS ALSO GOING TO SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY. YES THE EIGHTY FOUR REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY STOPPING MEGA FIRES BEFORE THEY START WE KNOW THAT UNDERGROUNDING ELECTRICAL LINES REDUCES FIRES BY NINETY NINE PERCENT. AND THIS LEGISLATION WILL HOLD ELECTRIC UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR TIMELY. YEAH NOT ALL UTILITIES ARE CREATED EQUAL THERE ARE SEVERAL UTILITIES IN THIS STATE. THAT HAVE DONE THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO BE A TO MAKE THEIR REGION MORE FIRE SAFE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE WITH P. GENIE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS P. GENIES FAILED AS CUSTOMERS AND MAKE CALIFORNIA. UNSAFE FOR YEARS HE DELIVERY UNDER FUNDED MODERNIZATION WILDFIRE SAFETY EFFORTS WHICH IS HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS YOUR IN THE GOLDEN STATE. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THEIR NEW CEO OR NEW CEO. WANTS TO ESTABLISH A PLAN TO BE A TO GET BROWN'S UNDERLYING. UNDERGROUND AND I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL. NOW SO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE WOMEN AND MEN FROM THE UTILITIES WORKERS UNION WHO HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH US. AND GRATEFUL FOR THAT CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE CONTINUING IN I CAN'T SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM. OFF FOR THEIR CONSIDER ENGAGEMENT. NOW CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PAST MANY YEARS HAVE LITERALLY RUN FOR THEIR LIVES WHETHER HOMES BURNED TO ESCAPE FLAMES FROM UTILITY BECAUSE. WILDFIRES OTHERS. I WERE UNABLE TO. IN OUR BACKGROUND IN SPECIALLY IN SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT. THEY PERISHED. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THESE UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES OF CHARGE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN LEVEL COMMUNITIES GENERATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUAL TO MILLIONS OF VEHICLES ANNUALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE THE SMOKE FROM THESE FIRES GENERATED THE QUIBBLING EMISSIONS OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION VEHICLES AND BLANKETED MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WITH UNHEALTHY SMOKE FOR WEEKS. CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAT IN THE DARK WITH FOOD SPOILING IN THE WARM REFRIGERATORS FOR DAYS ON END DURING WIND DRIVEN PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AND THEY'VE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO CRITICAL LIFELINE SERVICES WHEN POWER LINES GO DOWN. THIS IS BEEN OUR LIFE FOR LONG ENOUGH IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY- IS A BETTER WAY AND WE MUST MOVE WITH SPEED TO CREATE A PATH FORWARD TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WILL PROVIDE A PATH TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUND OF TEN THOUSAND MILES OF LINE ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE P. JEANNIE UTILITY TERRITORY IN HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES. CURRENTLY PG&amp;E UNDERGROUND APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILES OF ELECTRIC LINES ANNUALLY SO HERE'S WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO. NUMBER ONE. MANDATED PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. EXPECT TO SEE IF YOU SEE TO BE A DEVELOP FISCAL PENALTIES FOR NOT HEEDING TIMELINES. IN THE UTILITY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE SAFETY PROTOCOLS. ARE MET PRIOR TO RECEIVING A RATE OF RETURN. IT ALSO DEVELOPS THE PATHWAY TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUNDING CONSTRUCTION BY STOP WISHING A SHOT CLOCK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT PERMIT APPROVAL DENIAL TO JUST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. THE LEGISLATION WOULD SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY MANDATING UTILITIES USE AVAILABLE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS CONSTRUCT UNDERGROUND PROJECT BEFORE USING RATEPAYER FUNDS. AND IT WOULD MANDATE THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN THE SAME TRENCH AS ELECTRICAL UNDERGROUNDING IN THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONES. THIS DIG ONCE POLICY WILL HELP AS A CASHIER AND HELP MAKE OUR STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT. ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH FIRE RISK ZONES IT ALSO GUARANTEES A TWO ONE SEVENTY DAY JUDICIAL REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. IF AN UNDERGROUND PROJECT FACES A CALIFORNIA BERMAN EQUALITY ACT LAWSUIT. THIS LEGISLATION WILL FURTHER REDUCE THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT WERE SEEN FROM OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY CAL FIRE LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE WHO REPRESENTS THOUSANDS THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE- THEY KNOW THAT DEFENDING OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS FROM THESE WILDFIRES. ARE GROWING WORSE AND WORSE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS BILL. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. AND WE'RE HAVING MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS TO GET THIS DEAL DONE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH P. GENIE IN THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THE ARTICLE WORKERS ON THE LANGUAGE. IN THE BILL AND WILL CONTINUE ACTIVE DISCUSSION IN THE WEEKS TO COME. WE'RE ALSO IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY NINE. TRULY APPRECIATE THEIR ONGOING CONVERSATION COLLABORATION. WE'RE TAKING NAMES TODAY TO ADDRESS A BIG CONCERN OF THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS- NUMBER ONE AND THEN MINCED ARE BEING TAKEN TODAY THAT WILL CLARIFY. THAT EXISTING MICRO CELL SITES DON'T GO UNDERGROUND THAT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT IN THOSE POLLS WOULD REMAIN. IT'S COMMON SENSE. NUMBER TWO WE ARE DEFINING WHAT THE TARGETING OF LINES MOST AT RISK OF FIRE ARE. THEY WOULD BE LOCATED IN THOSE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. AS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE MITIGATION PLANS ADOPTED BY EACH OF THE INDEPENDENT- THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- IN THAT IS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. FINALLY WE'VE TAKEN UP SEVERAL BILLS OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE SPURRED CONCERN FROM THE TELECOMMUNICATION UTILITY INDUSTRIES. EVERY BILL WE WORKED ON TOGETHER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL THAT HAVE MADE OUR STATE MORE SAFE AND ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM INDUSTRY. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD SOME CRUNCHY BILLS IF YOU WILL ON SB SIX SEVENTY RELATED APPARENT THREE FORTY. THREE FORTY ONE RELATED OUTAGES THE BACKUP POWER. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH ALL THOSE CHALLENGES OVER THE MANY MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO GET A DEAL DONE. IT IS IT SAFER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SB EIGHT FOUR IS A WORK IN PROGRESS YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK. THIS BILL WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AN INMATE RIGHT HERE. THE WESTERN UNITED STATES IS GETTING HOTTER. IT'S GETTING DRIER THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES IS ONLY GETTING WORSE EVERYONE KNOWS THE ONLY PATH FORWARD IS FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES A SPEED UP THE PACE OF MOVING POWER LINES UNDERGROUND. LIVES ARE LITERALLY AT RISK THIS LEGISLATION WILL SUBJECT IS SAFEGUARDED COMMUNITIES AND SAVE RATEPAYERS MONEY AND THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE THAN TO SPEED UP THE PACE OF MOVING POWER LINES UNDERGROUND MISTER CHAIR I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TERRY MCHALE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE NOW RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY WILL NOW COME TO SPEAKERS. ORGANIZED PRESENTATION SPEAKERS- WE HAVE TERRY MCHALE WITH CAL FIRE LOCAL. TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE. F. THREE MINUTES MR MCHALE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN REED ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE. THE FIRES OF THE PAST THREE YEARS MISTER CHAIRMAN OR A MATTER OF RECORD. WE'VE SEEN MEGA FIRES CREATED THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED. BEFORE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BECAUSE OF THESE FIRES MISTER CHAIRMAN. ARE ALSO A MATTER OF RECORD. WE KNOW HOW THEIR BEGINNING. WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THE COURTS TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING CRIMINALLY CHARGED FOR IT. THE TRUTH IS SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE QUICKLY. I WOULD SUGGEST MISTER CHAIRMAN THE THIRTY YEARS THAT I HAVE REPRESENTED AND WORKED WITH CAL FIRE TO EIGHT EIGHT ONE. THERE HAS BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN FEW ISSUES MORE CONTROVERSIAL. IN OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT INDIVIDUALS GO OUT TO THE FIELD AND TALK ABOUT THE PERILOUS WIRES TOO CLOSE TO THE TREES. THIS PARTICULAR SENATE SEVERAL YEARS AGO A FARMER IN THE SENATE. COMPLAIN THAT THERE THE TREETOPS AND HIS AND HIS- ORCHARD WERE LOPPED OFF THE DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE WIRING OVERHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN. WE HAVE FIREFIGHTERS WHO GET CALLED TO A FIRE THE CAMPFIRE ALONE WENT SEVENTEEN DAYS WITHOUT ABATEMENT. OUR FIREFIGHTERS NOT ONLY HAVE TO FIGHT THOSE SEVENTEEN DAYS OF FIRE THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THE FIRST IN THE VICINITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EMBERS DON'T REIGNITE. SOMETHING CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE. IN TERMS OF THE POLLS THEMSELVES THE FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXHAUSTING. THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER USES FORUM. AND RECOGNIZE THAT THAT DISCUSSION WILL CARRY ON IN OTHER COMMITTEES. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS MISTER CHAIRMAN WE ARE GOING TO GO UNDERGROUND EITHER WE DO IT NOW WE DO IT AFTER ANOTHER FIRE SEASON WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE AS PERILOUS. AS THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO QUIT PAINTING THE BUGGY AND PUTTING FLOWERS AND RIBBONS ON THE HORSES AND DO THE HARD DATE WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL GO TO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT.

THE IMPACT OF THESE PROVIDERS ADDS UP TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WELL WE APPRECIATE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S EFFORTS TO QUICKLY MAKE HIGH WILDFIRE AREAS MORE RESISTANT SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR GOES FAR BEYOND THAT. GOAL AND CREATES MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OR DISCRETION FOR SERVICE RELIABILITY OR ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY SB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR MANDATE. THAT BROADBAND PROVIDERS WHEN SHARING A POLL WITH ELECTRIC CORPORATION UNDERGROUND THEIR EQUIPMENT I SHOULD THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION CHOOSE TO UNDERGROUND THEIR OWN FACILITIES. UNLIKE THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION TO COULD POTENTIALLY RECOVER THEIR COSTS FROM THE RATE PAYERS TO THEIR RATE CASE PROCESS BROADBAND PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO RECOVER COST AS WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. AND ARE RELUCTANT TO ADD SURCHARGES OR POSSIBLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. INVARIABLY THESE COSTS WILL EITHER COME OUT OF TWO PLACES NUMBER ONE THEY WILL COME OUT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BUDGETS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON DEPLOYING AND UPGRADING BROADBAND. IN SUCH CASES TO RULE CALIFORNIA'S OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT YET HAVE IT. BROADBAND PRICES WOULD COULD RIGHTS COUNTERING THE PROGRESS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BROADBAND PROVIDER AND THIS LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AFFORDABLE AND IN SOME CASES FREE OFFER. AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. WHAT MORE WHAT'S MORE IS THAT THE HIGHER COSTS WOULD COME AT A TIME WHEN ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE NAVIGATING A HISTORIC INFLATIONARY PERIOD IMPACTING ALL GOODS AND SERVICES. AT A MINIMUM BROADBAND PROVIDERS WHAT THE DISCRETION TO STAY ON THE POLLS AND WOOD UNDERGROUND IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE THIS IS CURRENTLY THE PRACTICE OF AN ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S REMOVING A PAUL. KOSTER DISCUSSED AND OFTEN SHARED WITH COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL PARTIES I'M SORRY DISPENSER MULLIN YOU WENT WAY OVER IN TIME WELCOME TO THE NICHOLAS. AND ON THIS- THANK YOU AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE. KEEP IT TOO AND IF I COULD REMEMBER UNIQUE GREEN AND THEN THIS. GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS WITH ANY OF GAS AND ELECTRIC- WE SEND SOME POINT FOR THE OTHER BUT MUCH RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE- THIS BILL SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND WITHHOLDING EARNINGS FOR FIVE YEARS. ON A CERTAIN METRICS ARE AREARE CHEAP COMPLEX WITH THE CONTACT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE STATE- NO PS PS OR WILD CARDS IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. REGARDING THE COLD LOOK FOR THREE ISSUE AMEND. DON'T PROVIDE CLARITY ON AND COST RECOVERY THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE OF FACILITIES SOMETIMES THEY'RE CO OWNED SOMETIMES THERE LEAST- THE BILL OVERALL IS DUPLICATIVE OF PEACE HERE READY PROVES INTEGRATING PROJECT AS PART OF THE W. W. M. P. AND THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE HAVE A- HOLISTIC COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WE TAKE A LOOK AT COST BENEFIT- AND FEASIBILITY- AND- THE BILL. I WOULD NOT IN OUR OPINION EXPEDITE WORK MAKE UNDERGROUND MORE COST EFFECTIVE DUE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND- PERMITTING. PROCESS THESE. ULTIMATELY THESE COSTS- WOULD BE BORNE BY CUSTOMERS- SO RESPECTFULLY YOU KNOW ESTY GENIE AS COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE RISK OF WILDFIRES AND WE'VE INVESTED OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND SYSTEM HARDENING.

FOUR OPPOSITION OF SB EIGHT EIGHTY FOUR OKAY THANK YOU WILL COME TO THE COMMITTEE NOW AND JUST GENERALLY- IF I CAN MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. RELATED TO THIS MATTER AND THIS BILL HAVING HAD WORKED ON YOU KNOW THE PG&amp;E BANKRUPTCY THE WILDFIRE ISSUE THAT- WAS CHAIRED BY SENATOR DODD I MEAN WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK. RESPONDING TO THE WILDFIRES MAKING WORKING TO MAKE UTILITIES SAY FOR DEVELOPING IN- MASSIVE- FISHERMAN'S FUND FIND A WAY TO ENSURE THE- VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES AMID THIS IS BEEN. YEARS AND YEARS OF WORK AND- YOU KNOW IT'S THIS POINT- CONSIDERING LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT'S A TOUGH THING. TO WORK THROUGH WHERE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE- UTILITY CONTINUING TO CAUSE WILDFIRES WHILE WERE- WE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF- YOU KNOW HARDING THE WORKING TO. SUPPORT AND FINANCE HI HEARTGARD IN THE GRID RAKERS OF PAYING FOR THAT. BUT THIS IS A HARD ISSUE AND WE WANT OUR UTILITIES TO SURVIVE. WE WANT THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS BECAUSE ENERGY OF COURSE IS SO KEY TO THE RUNNING OF OUR STATE. BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE DON'T YOU KNOW BREAK THE BANK IN TERMS OF REQUIRING. RATES TO SKYROCKET. AND AGAIN THIS BILL OF WHILE IT'S A STATEWIDE MEASURE. IT WORRIES ME THAT A YOU KNOW IN PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO OR WE HAVE INCREASED RATES TOO. HARD IN OUR GRID WHERE WE HAVE CREATED PROGRAMS TO FIGHT FIRES. THAT THIS SHOULD EVEN APPLY TO SAN DIEGO ANOTHER UTILITIES THAT AREN'T IN THE SAME CATEGORY. AS PG&amp;E AND I KNOW PSG I MEAN THIS. DOESN'T HELP THE P. JEANNIE CAME OUT AND SAID WE'RE GONNA. UNDERGROUND UTILITIES- WITHOUT REALLY HAVING A PLAN AND WITHOUT RELEASED- SAYING HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO COST AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND SO THAT ADDS OF. FUEL TO THE PER PER VIEW RUBIO FIRE HERE. IN THAT- IT GIVES RISE TO LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THAT. THIS SIMPLY ASKING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY SO THIS IS A REALLY HARD ONE TO- TO BALANCE- BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE SOME READ REASONABLE MEASURES IN THIS BILL. IN ALL I WANT TO AUTHORS WE MOVE FORWARD TO CONSIDER THE PLACES LIKE SANDY WILL COULD BE AFFECTED LIKE THIS- WE WILL THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF SAN DIEGO RECENTLY AND HAVING THE HIGHEST RATES IN THE COUNTRY. IN IN IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY AND- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ANGRY SO. WE ARE WORKING TO FIGHT FIRES TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THERE'S A BREAKING POINT WHERE PEOPLE ARE ARE SAYING I'M NOT GONNA PAY FOR THIS ANYMORE. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL AS A LEGISLATURE NOT TO PUT PUSH THOSE CALLS. ARE TO OR COSTS ON RATEPAYERS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE UP. ON ON THE FIGHT TO SOLVE SOME OF THE CLIENTS MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS. OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SO- ALL ON THIS BILL- I APPRECIATE THE- AUTHOR WORKING ON THIS BILL WORKING WITH US BUT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD I HOPE YOU CONSIDER PLACES LIKE SAN DIEGO WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO THINK TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS AND WHERE. YOU KNOW UNDERGROUNDING NET ISN'T NECESSARILY PART OF OUR STRATEGY- AND WHERE WHERE IT COULD DRIVE UP COSTS FOR OUR REPAIRS WHERE WE CAN'T REALLY AFFORD THAT AND I KNOW THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOW YOU'RE WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I WILL BE ANOTHER OR THERE ARE SOME VERY REAL- CHANGES THAT NEED TO MAKE THE MAKE AND I KNOW YOU'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPE THAT YOU REALLY GET TO. THE CRUX OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WILL COME DOWN MEMBERS KNOCKED APPRECIATE SEPT IN THE MAINTENANCE AND- WERE RECOMMENDING THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS- COME TO CENTER MEN FOLLOWED BY RUBIO THAN BRADFORD AND IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE- AND OUR DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK CENTER STERN OKAY AND THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO ECHO YOUR COMMENTS I THINK YOU SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ON. THE TRADE OUTSOURCING THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS BILL- TRYING TO SOLVE A VERY REAL PROBLEM IN THE STATE- THE RISKS THAT ARE. UTILITIES SUPPOSED TO THE PROBLEM OF WILDFIRES. AT THE SAME TIME WHO PAYS FOR THOSE PROPHYLACTIC MEASURES I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION- HI I TALK WITH THE AUTHOR EARLIER THIS WEEK AT NIGHT I KNOW THAT HE'S COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OPPOSITION COMMITTED TO BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. ON SO THAT I WILL VOTE TODAY TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE- BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SEE HOW THE FINAL PRODUCT SHAPES UP- GOING FORWARD- SO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK MR MAJORITY LEADER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE FINAL PRODUCT. OKAY- CENTER- WAS NEXT SENATOR RUBIO WE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I THINK- BOTH- SENATORS HAVE EXPRESSED A SOME OF MY CONCERNS AND BUT I JUST WANT TO START BY KNOWLEDGE GENE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST YEARS AND YOU KNOW I WAS PART OF MANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT. ARE YEP NEGOTIATIONS WITH AB TEN FIFTY FOUR I BELIEVE IT WAS AND YOU KNOW WE HEARD THE STORIES OF LIVES LOST WE HEARD THE STORIES OF HOMES DESTROYED AND LET'S FACE A SIMILAR TRAUMA THAT THESE FAMILIES HAVE IT ENTERED I MEAN SOMEONE NEVER GET OVER IT SO WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A REAL CRISIS HERE AND WE- ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT COST AND THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS PLAN WHICH IS YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NEEDED AS WE'VE ALREADY STATED SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO START MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST BEING PUSHED DOWN TO RATE PAYERS AND- AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW THE EXTENT PRECISION I HAD OVER THE WEEKEND WITH AUTHOR IN FACT I APPRECIATE THE- AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SHARED WITH. MORNING ARE BUT I STILL I BELIEVE THAT- EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL STATES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXHAUST ALL FEDERAL. AND STATE FUNDING BEFORE THEY CAN RECOVER FROM RATE PAYERS I THINK THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE A COST ON THE LASSEN AND WE ARE STRUGGLING IN TERMS OF- I THINK ONE OF THE SPEAKERS STATED THE INFLECTION INFLICT THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. ARE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW MORE OFTEN IT'S AS IT PERTAINS TO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T TO PASS HIGH COST TO OUR REPAIRS NUMBER ONE BUT I TO I ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I THE I USE YOU KNOW OUR CAN DO THIS VOLUNTARILY BUT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE BEING ASKED TO DO THIS IT'S VERY COSTLY AS WELL AND SO AGAIN I FEEL AT THE END. OUR REPAIRS MAY LOSE EITHER WAY BUT IT'S NECESSARY IT'S IMPORTANT- IT'LL SAVE LIVES AND SO I'M. ALSO TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHORED TO FIND THAT MY GROUND WITH THE TELE. COMPANIES TO REALLY SIT DOWN WITH EVERYONE AND AS EVIDENCED BY ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT THIS MORNING I KNOW ALL THAT HE HAS COMMITTED- YOU KNOW HE MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO ME TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO I ALSO WANT TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD TO SEE WHAT WE CAN. I GET TOOK A PLACE- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL WITH THE- SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNS BUT I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT TO ENSURE THAT. WE CONTINUE TO. FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SAVE LIVES AND- AND MOVES TO THE NEXT YOU KNOW FUTURE GENERATIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME AND- I WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU. CENTER BRADFORD RISE IN ONE EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AS FOR THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO WORK FOR UTILITY. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDERGROUNDING HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MANY OF THESE PLACES FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. AND IT WAS TRANSISTORS AND- INDUCTORS THAT WEREN'T MADE AS WELL AS THEIR MADE TODAY AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE ONGOING. FOREST FIRES IN MY TWELVE YEARS AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAJOR FIRE IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IN IT WASN'T CALLS BY THE UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE SO IN ONE BREATH WE WANT TO BLAME IT ON CLIMATE CHANGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BLAME IT ON THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT. MANAGE TO FORCED ANYMOREWE DO NOT CLEAR WINDS AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO REPRESENTED URBAN AREA I UNDERSTOOD AND HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE RURAL AREAS WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO GET LINE CLEARING DONE. THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW A COBINATION OF FILLING THE CUT DOWN TREES. AND OUR CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF THESE POLES AND WIRES HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THE SAME RIGHT AWAYS FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AND WE WEREN'T HAVING ONGOING FIRES. THIRTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS AGO IT IS RECENT OCCURRENCE AS EVEN AUTHORS STATED IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SET OUT SIXTEEN. BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE HAVE SEEN A LOCK A MANAGING OF OUR FORCE AND THERE WILL BE A REAL COSTS TO RATEPAYERS. THE UNDERGROUND LINE IS USUALLY ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS PLUS A MILE. AND THAT'S BOUNCE ON THE REPAIRS BELIEVE ME. IT'S NOT A CHEAP ENDEAVOR I OVERSAW. THREE OR FOUR RULE TWENTY PROJECTS THAT'S IN URBAN AREAS DURING MY TIME AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND DELAY IN JUST BY DOING THAT ALONE IT WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL TAKE. YEARS TO GET THE AVERAGE UPRIGHTS ARE PROJECT PLANNED AND DONE AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE JOINT POLL SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TELCO AND CABLE AND ON NOW BROADBAND ON THE ON THE POLE TO AND NOW ASKING THEM TO GOING TO A TRENCH I'M GONNA TELL YOU FOLKS. UNDERGROUNDING SPECIALLY HIGH TRANSMISSION LINES LEADS TO LONGER OUTAGES SO WHAT WE WILL CREATE AS A CUSTOMER BASE WHO NOW WILL BE COMPLAINING WHY HAS MY POWER NOW BEEN OFF FOR DAYS IF NOT WEEKS AT A TIME BECAUSE WHEN IT'S OVERHEAD YOU CAN EASILY SPOT. A BAD TRENDS- TRANSFORMERS BAD- CONDUCTOR ARE BAD RESISTIR A BAD WIRE WHEN IT'S UNDERGROUND YOU HAVE TO DIG IN SEARCH FOR THAT BAD OUTAGE AND IT TAKES SOMETIMES DAYS TO FIND OUT SO I JUST WANT TO CAUTION I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS BUT I THINK. WE'RE MOVING OUT IN THE WERE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IF WE THINK UNDERGROUNDING IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WHAT WILL SOLVE IT. FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR IS DOING BETTER MANAGING OF OUR FORCE. APPLYING BLIND CLEARING TO REMOVE THE FUEL THAT EXISTS THERE TODAY SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY. VERY WELL CENTER STERN. MAYBE THE AUTHOR WILL WANT TO COMMENT ED I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I HI IBM BECAUSE THEY SHARE MY COLLEAGUES FROM LA HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NEW CLIMATE CHANGE FACTOR IN TRANSMISSION RISK- BUT BECAUSE OF THAT THAT RISK- WITH HIGHER WINDS WITH HOTTER DAYS. WITH MORE WILDFIRE TO ME THAT. THAT THAT COUNSELS US TO EXPEDITE A BILL LIKE THIS TO BE MOVING IT FORWARD- AND I'VE WHAT I SENSE FROM THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND FROM THE AUTHOR AND I WANT TO GET. THE AUTHORS COMMENTS ON THIS BUT- SO WILLINGNESS TO. TO TARGET THIS BILL TO LOOK AT FIRESTONE SPECIFICALLY TO REALLY. TAILOR THAT RISK. TO NOT MAKE THIS AN OPEN ENDED RATEPAYER COSTS BUT BUT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO DEAL SPECIFICALLY. WITH WILDFIRE RISK AND THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING THEIR POWER SHUT OFF. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WE'VE SEEN THESE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS COME OUT. AND HIT THE POWER STILL GETS SHUT DOWN EVERY TIME THE WIND KICKS IN THE OVER SEVENTY MILES AN HOUR SIXTY MILES AN HOUR SOME DAYS NOT EVEN THAT. THE NEW OF ELDERLY PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. THE MEDICAL SERVICES PEOPLE ON NEBULIZERS LITERALLY LOSING THEIR POWER LOSING THEIR LIFELINE- I THINK WE GET. ON THE OVERHEAD SYSTEM BUT I WOULD I WOULD REALLY HOPE FROM THE AUTHOR IS THAT. THROUGH ALL THE PRESSURE YOU'RE GETTING. AND ALL THOSE STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT YOU DON'T- WE DON'T JUST FOCUS ON THE P. JEANNIE CHALLENGE BECAUSE I THINK IN EDISON COUNTRY- WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME OF. VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES WE LIKE TO SEE SOME SIMILAR LEADERSHIP FROM MEDICINES. CO IN FROM FROM CORPORATE SIDE THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF THEIR COMMITMENT FOR. FOR MILES OF LINES WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR FRANKLY ENJOYING USES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THIS EFFORT. I APPRECIATE AND TRUST YOU TO NAVIGATE THE ALL THE COMPLEX ISSUES BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS A STAKE IN THIS TOO. AND THEY. ARE BENEFITING FROM THE USE THOSE LINES. A SO TO LEAVE THEM OUT OF THE PUZZLE AND CUT THEM OUT ENTIRELY AND SAVE THE TELECOM INDUSTRY. SHOULDN'T BE PAYING PART OF THIS. BELIES THE NATURE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF THAT EQUIPMENT HANGING ON THOSE LINES WE'VE ALL GOT TO DO OUR PART. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING EVERYONE TOGETHER AND- THAT. WOULD MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON. ON JUST THAT YOUR YOUR- YOUR EFFORTS AROUND THE REFINEMENT IN SOME OF THE ISSUES MAY BE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL AS MYSELF. THANK YOU SO MUCH. A VERY WELL ANYONE ELSE. AND YEAH WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STERN TO- THE BILL FORWARD- WITH AMENDMENTS. A AND THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE- YOU HAS TO BE AMENDED IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE CENTERS FOR DID YOU WANT MAKES COMMENTS I WOULD CHOICE RIGHT POLITICIANS. I THE ROOM FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT YEAH I WOULD BECAUSE- WHAT YOU KNOW EARLY STAGES BILL AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH SHERMAN. BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION CARS ON THE ROAD THAT'S HOW MUCH THE POLLUTION SMOG THAT FOR THE SMOKE ALL THE STAFF WERE ENGAGED IN A DEEP DISCUSSION. ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT TO DO AND SO ON THE ONE HAND WORKING ON ELECTRIFICATION WORKING ON. ALL OF THESE STANDARDS TO TRY TO REDUCE THE ATMOSPHERIC CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. AND THE OTHER HAND THESE FIRES JOSH TO BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE- CHANGE EVERYTHING. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO- GIVE CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR WHO IS IT OFFERS ME AYE I GO INTO A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUE IF WE COULD. JUST UNDERGROUND EVERYTHING AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO REDUCE THIS RISK AGAIN WHEN I'M TRYING TO BRING TO THIS DISCUSSION IS A LARGER CONTEXT MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN TERMS OF THE LARGER DYNAMIC OF WHAT WE'RE FACING I CERTAINLY DON'T YOU KNOW. AT THE SAME CHALLENGES THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT THAT CENTER MCGUIRE DOES BUT THE CHALLENGES HE FACED AFFECTS ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA. AND I JUST THINK THAT AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION. YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS AND YES DIFFICULT. BUT WE GOT TO THINK MUCH BIGGER AND I GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR FOR THINKING BIG IN THIS AND- ONE SUPPORT THE BILL. VERY WELL WE HAVE A MOTION- DID YOU WANT TO MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS AND REQUIRE YES I WOULD THINK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH CARE AND APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY. A FEW ITEMS AND JUST BEEN TAKING NOTES AND I'M GRATEFUL. RIGHT NOW P. GENIES BEEN IN ABOUT ONE POINT THREE TO ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND TREE TRIMMING. ONE POINT THREE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. SO THAT'S GOING TO GO ON A PER TUTTI IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE YEARS AGO AND THAT START ON THE GROUND IN THE LINES. SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVICE TOWARD THE TERRITORY'S ESTY GENIE SOCAL EDISON PG&amp;E THEIR BASS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS SIX FORWARD BUT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO LEARN FROM THE PAST WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT P. JEANNIE. THEY HAVE VASTLY UNDER INVESTED IN HARDENING THEIR LINES. THEY HAVE UNDER INVESTED IN. FOR ME TREE TRIMMING AROUND THE LINES THEY'VE UNDER INVESTED IN FIRE SAFETY NAMES UNDER INVESTED IN UNDERGROUND. IT'S A NEW DAY. SO HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY. LITERALLY THE C. E. O. IS SAYING THAT SHE WANTS TO UNDERGROUND TEN THOUSAND MILES OF LINE. THERE'S NO PLAN. WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE PLAN TO GET THE JOB DONE. 99% REMEMBER THE NUMBER THEY DON'T START WINNING UNDERGROUND 99% IN WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WITH THE ADDED USE THE OUTAGES. FULL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE LEGALLY GOING WEEKS WITHOUT POWER YOU ALL WEEKS. WE DON'T LIVE IN THE NATION IT DOESN'T HAVE POWER FOR WEEKS. AND HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO TOLERATE THIS. WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER FOR WEEKS. THIS IS INSANE AND JUST BEING REALLY CANDID I'LL GIVE YOU MY BELIEF IN MY SEVEN YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATORS NOT HOLDING THIS UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE TO BE ABLE TO FIX OUR LINE AND MAKE THE COMMUNITIES MORE FIRE SAFE. SO LOOK NO BILL IS PERFECT. NO I DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE BILLS THAT I HAVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH MY GOD HOW MANY YEARS IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO GET. THIS DONE. SO I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS ABOUT THIS BILL IT'S OFTEN. IT'S OFTEN. THE VAST MAJORITY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TODAY VOTED FOR SB TEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WAS OFTEN. SO WE'RE NOT SO AS THE GENIE IN SOCAL EDISON IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PARTICIPATE. I GET IT THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING CHALLENGES WITH GREATER RETURN BUT MY GOD HOW ELSE ARE WE GOING TO HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE. AND I ALSO SAID IN MY STATEMENT NOT ALL UTILITIES ARE CREATED EQUAL ESTY GENIE OVER HALF THEIR SYSTEM IS UNDERGROUND OVER HALF P. GENIES DOING LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILES A YEAR TRY TO WRAP UP NUMBERS REQUIRED SO WE HAVE QUITE OF THE JOE KAY I'M JUST GOING TO ENTER RIGHT HERE. ON BROADBAND I WOULD WELCOME. THOSE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO SHOW US. WHERE THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE NOT COMMITTED TO PLAY BROADBAND BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU IN THESE TEN THOUSAND MILES OF HIGH FIRE RISK LINES. THERE'S BARELY ANYTHING THAT THEY'VE DONE THESE INCOMING UTILITIES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER HIGH SPEED INTERNET. SO CANDIDLY IT'S A BIT DISINGENUOUS. AND IT'S A FALSE ARGUMENT BUT I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN HIS YOU KNOW. TAKE ON BIG STUFF. YOU WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES NOT ALL BILLS A PERFECT BUT I COMMITTEE EACH AND ONE EVERYONE OF YOU TODAY WE'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGH THIS WE'RE TO WORK COLLABORATIVE LEE. I'M GRATEFUL AND I WOULD BE REALLY HONORED FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SAVE LIVES WE HAVE TO END. THESE FIRES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE NOW WE HAVE A MOTION CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB EIGHT FOUR BY SENATOR MCGUIRE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO BE AMENDED IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE WESSEL.

NINE A STIR OKAY THAT HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WE'LL KEEP THE ROLE OF THE FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL- WE HAVE- S. B. TEN THIRTY TWO BY SENATOR. BECKER A BILL RELATING TO CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. WELCOME CENTER. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT RISING ELECTRICITY RATES AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE INVESTING IN OUR SYSTEM TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AS WE DISCUSSED AND WHICH ARE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. SB TEN THIRTY TWO IS AN EFFORT TO MAKE BUILDING ELECTRIC. BUILDING ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION FASTER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CHEAPER. THAT WE CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THIS INVESTMENT ON OUR ENERGY BILLS. ACACIA RECENTLY AT RECENT TWENTY YEAR OUTLOOK FOR TRANSMISSION PLANNING ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION FOR THE THIRTY FIVE BILLION IN NEW TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. WILL BE NEEDED BY TWENTY FORTY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD OUT THAT MUCH TRANSMISSION. THE BETTER TAKES STEPS TO DO AS EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PRIORITY SB ONE HUNDRED ACTIONS REPORT CONSIDERED AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS. IN IDENTIFIED THE FORMATION OF A TRANSMISSION AUTHORITY. SECOND FUND AND BUILD NEW TRANSMISSION PROJECTS. AS WOULD REDUCE THE COST REPAIRS AND BUILDING OUT TRANSMISSION. SB TEN THIRTY TWO IS AN EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION. WE MODEL THE PROPOSED INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY ON A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION THIRTY NEW MEXICO WHICH ALREADY WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO GET TWO MAJOR NEW TRANSMISSION LINES BUILT. BASIC EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THATLOWERING COSTS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST FINANCING. IN ADDITION TO BUILDING TO LEVERAGE LOW COST STATE FINANCING IN INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY. HAS OF A SET OF TOOLS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE PROJECT RISKS AND TIMELINES. BY REDUCING DUPLICATIVE REVIEW PROCESS SEES AND EXPEDITING PERMITTING AND SITING. THAT'S WHY WE INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY THE COMPARTMENT UTILITIES OR OTHER TRANSMISSION DEVELOPERS AND HAVE AN OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THESE PROJECTS. THE NUMBER OF GROUPS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THIRTY IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED IN A VERY KNOWLEDGE THAT ITIS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IT'S A BIG IT'S A BIG TOPIC. INTERESES BILLS WAY TO GET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO GET A LOT OF TRANSITION BUILT. IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WELL PROTECTING RATEPAYERS FROM ESCALATING ENERGY COSTS. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR KEEPING THOSE GOALS. AND PUTTING OUT IMPORTANT CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY. DELAYED THESE CONCERNS- AND TALKING TO THE CHAIR OF OPPOSING A CHANGE THIS BILL. AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY. TO ONE WHICH WILL DIRECT THE RELEVANT AGENCIES TO STUDY THE QUESTION. OF WHETHER AND HOW PUBLIC FINANCING OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. CAN GET THIS CRUCIAL WORK DONE FASTER AND CHEAPER. AND TO RETURN THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH A PROPOSED CHANGE ESPECIALLY ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IMAGE OF ONE WITNESS ON THE LINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I JUST WANTED TO- ASK YOU A CENTER IF YOUR- SPEAKERS. ARE AWARE OF YOUR PROPOSAL. YES ROOM WHAT WITH THIS AND I BELIEVE SO OKAY- SO WE WILL NOW GO TO SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE YOU HAVE- ONE ONE SPEAKER ALEX- BRICKELL. AND HE'S WITH THE CLEANER TASK FORCE AND WILL- IS HE HERE PRESENT OR IS ON THE LINE. ON THE LINE OKAY THEN YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES MISSED RECALL PLEASE PROCEED. I THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHERMAN WAY PHONE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT'S THE FIGHT TODAY. I'M ALEX MICHAEL DIRECTOR OF CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT OF THE CLEAN AIR TASK FORCE WE'RE A GLOBAL NGO WORKING TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION QUICKLY AFFORDABLY AND EQUITABLY. I WANT TO START BY ECHOING COMMENTS MADE EARLIER BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AT THE COMMITTEE HEARING- AND ECHOED AGAIN BY SENATOR RECORD THE NEW TRANSMISSION CAPACITY IS THE LINCHPIN OF A RESILIENT. ECONOMY AND THE STATE MUST URGENTLY TACKLE CAR THEN PUT IT IN CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING. EQUALITY AMBITION. I NOW TO CONDUCT THE RIGHT STATE AID AND OTHER READ OR TO. THAT WE FIND THAT A AT THE ONE. LARA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEW QUEEN IN AND PUSH. THE TRADE COMMISSION. PARTICULAR WILL LIKELY NEED TO DOUBLE IN PRICE TO ACCOMMODATE NEW USED IN THE PLAYING ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTORS FIRST RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES. HOWEVER IT'S BECOMING HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE THE BILL MAJOR NEW TRANSMISSION FACILITIESAND STATE ALREADY FACING AN ENERGY AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. THANK YOU PROPER LOAN THE BALLOON ONE HUNDRED AND 50% OVER THE LAST DECADE. IT AND IT CAN TAKE TEN YEARS OR MORE TO DEVELOP MAJOR TRANSMISSION LINES. AND EVEN TODAY IMPLICATION TRANSMISSION CAPACITY IS BILLING THE CLIENT AFFORDABILITY AND CLEAN AIR BENEFITS. OF DOZENS OF LARGE SALUTE FULLER PROJECT IN THE STATE BANK CONTRIBUTED TO CONTINUE USE OF POLLUTING FOSSIL. FUEL FACILITIES AND COMMUNITY AND- COMMITTEE BACK ALREADY MENTIONED THE JOINT AGENCIES REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR ON PRIORITY ISSUE ONE HUNDRED ACTION. RECOMMENDS CREATING- AND THE FORTY THE FACILITATION MISSION DEVELOPMENT ANY. FOR STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THAT THE AUTHORITY IS A REALLY GREAT MODEL REDUCING COST TIME AND COMPLEXITY. HOW CAN MISSION AND STATE. WHILE INTEGRATING RATHER THAN DUPLICATING IF THEY THINK THAT THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. WE ENVISION THE AUTHORITY SUPPORTING THE MOST CRITICAL YET CHALLENGING TRANSMISSION NEED FROM THE BAY RATHER THAN EVERY TRANSMISSION LINE IN THE STATE EXAMPLES INCLUDE INTEGRATING OFFER A WIND TURBINE FOR STRENGTHENING TIES BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH. AND GIVEN THE DECADE LONG DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE AND GROWING COST FOR MAJOR TRANSMISSION PROJECT. THE STATEMENT URGENTLY IDENTIFY POLLUTION RECORD LOW COUGH SUFFICIENT BALABAC OF THESE CRITICAL TRANSMISSION AFTER. SEVERAL TOOLS THAT WE THINK MIGHT BE USEFUL ULTIMATELY FOR THE FORTY ODD THE HOBBIT SHE WHEN THE POLLS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED I'LL JUST REITERATE PROVIDING LOW COST FINANCING THE REVENUE BONDS OR OTHER MECHANISMS AVOIDING REDUNDANT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEAD AGENCY. THANK YOU THANK YOU OF OKAY NOW WILL- MOVED TO SPEAKERS. IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN THIRTY TO FEEL JUST STATE. YOUR NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON MENTOR ANYONE HERE IN THE GALLERY.

REALITY PROJECTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE NO FURTHER LINES IN Q. FOUR SB TEN THIRTY TO SUPPORT. OKAY NUMBER OF SPEAKERS ARE WILL GO TO- SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION I'M GONNA ASK THE SPEAKERS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDED BILL THAT. COURSE NOT THE STRUCTURE WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY BUT WHAT THE AUTHOR AS INTENDED TO DO. THAT SO IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT- I ASKED YOU TO SPEAK TO THAT. AND YOU HAVE WE WILL BEGIN WITH- JOHNSON BUT NEED JONES WITH INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF. YES YES- MISTER CHAIRMAN JETS MANY JOBS INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT WE HEARD- THE AUTHOR- COMMIT TO- THE REALITY IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DELIVER. CLEAN RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC WITH THAT ISSUE HOWEVER WE THINK THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD WE NEED RIGHT NOW- IS YET ANOTHER STATE AGENCY DEALING WITH- CLEAN ENERGY AND THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM- SO- WE WE'VE HEARD SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS- WE THINK THAT- PERHAPS- YOU KNOW FINANCE. YOU KNOW FINANCING THROUGH EXISTING BINDING AUTHORITIES IN THE STATE ABOUT THE NEVER STRUCTURE BACK THAT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA- GIVING THE EYES SO THE PRESUMPTION- A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT WHEN THEY IDENTIFY SOMETHING IS NEEDED IT'S NEEDED YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA- AND- YOU KNOW THE IT IT MAY WELL BE THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL SEQUEL- SIMPLIFICATIONS ARE ALL GREAT IDEAS. NONE OF THEM REQUIRE CREATING YET ANOTHER AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS YEAH AND DO WE AT ONE TIME WE HAD THE CALIFORNIA POWER AUTHORITY- IT WENT NOWHERE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES. CREATING IT NO PROJECT CAME OUT OF IT SO I WOULD REALLY- WE DO WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME OR THE ENERGY RATE NOW TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO CREATE YET ANOTHER AUTHORITY THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE. IS ACTUALLY THAT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO GETTING THIS. TRANSMISSION AND TIMELY MATTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND JUST CLARIFY. THE AUTHOR DID AND YET AND- CENTER BAKER YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO MY COMMENTS BUT- THE AYE THE IDEA IS AT THE CENTER WORKING WITH COMMITTEE IS GOING TO COME UP WITH A BILL THAT ALL ANALYZE HOW TO ACT EXPEDITE TRANSMISSION. HOW TO IDENTIFY IT WHERE IT'S NEEDED AND HOW TO GO ABOUT- DOING THAT IN A IN A MORE EFFICIENT. MANNER MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND SO THE IDEA IS TO- TO ANALYSIS AND THAT HAVE A STUDY COME BACK WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE NOT ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE. THE CREATION OF AN AGENCY BUT IT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DICTATE THAT THAT BE THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT AGAIN IF- IF WE GO DOWN THIS PATH AND ASK FOR A VERY- THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS IS DONE WE WOULD LIKE EVERYTHING TO BE ON THE TABLE. THAT WE GET ANOTHER ANALYSIS IT GETS TO THE CRUX OF HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH THIS STATE SCHOOLS OF. OF CREATING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE MOST FISHING COSTS AND MOST EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY- AND BASICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT THE STRATEGY IS TO DO THAT OR WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN- CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE- REGULATORY. FRAMEWORK FOR ENERGY AND POWER SO- CENTER BAKER DID YOU WANNA ADD TO THAT. IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY AND BECAUSE OF WAS NOT THE PACKAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CLEAR. AFTER TALKING CHAIR WE DECIDE MAKE THIS A STUDY BILL- ON THE ISSUES. YOU MENTION ALSO BEGINS FOR SPECIFICALLY RUN HEALTH HOW PUBLIC FINANCING A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. CAN HELP GET THIS WORK DONE. FASTER AND- MORE CHEAPLY BUT SHRIMP MAKE SURE MY- COLLEAGUES IN THE IN THE ROOM ARE CLEAR ON THAT. THAT AFTER TALKING SURE WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE CITY A STUDY BILL OKAY VERY GOOD SO WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT- LEAD OPPOSITION SPEAKER JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE- ROLE COUNTY WERE SET REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA- MISTER KENNEDY AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON KENNEDY WITH RC RC AND ALTERNATIVE IN MY COMMENTS TO WHAT WAS SUGGESTED. STILL TRYING TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH IT AND SEE- HOW THIS COULD END UP. I THINK WE ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS AND TO EXPEDITE THESE PROJECTS. WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH ENERGY AFFORDABILITY IN A LOT OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH- WITH DELAYS AND RELIABILITY SO WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING TO THE CORE PROBLEM HERE AND FINDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO GET THERE. BUT I THINK EVEN WITH THE A STUDY WE WOULD STILL HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE MODEL INVOLVES THE STATE AS AN AUTHORITY WHO'S DOING THESE THINGS- AND OUR CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE THE DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FIRST IF THE STATE IS INVOLVED IS THE AUTHORITY OWNING THESE FACILITIES- THOSE ARE EXEMPT FROM LOCAL ZONING LAWS AND THAT WOULD EXEMPT THEM FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY TO COME IN AND DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE PLANS WITH THOSE FACILITIES. ARE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL PRIORITIES AND OBJECTIVES SECOND IF THE STATE IS INVOLVED IN OWNERSHIP IT WOULD- INVOLVED IN A HIT TO LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. WHICH IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE PROVISION OF LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES SO AGAIN IF THE STATE IS THE ONE WHO IS RUNNING THIS OWNING THE LAND. THEN WE HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THE DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS. UNLESS THEIR PROPERTY TAX BACKFILL AND LAST THOSE PROJECTS ARE SUBJECT LOCAL ZONING AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR SUGGESTED ABOUT LIABILITY- I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS THE STATE TO TAKE ON GREATER LIABILITY AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES AS WELL- WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE THAT COMES OUT AND- RECONSIDER POSITION ACCORDINGLY BUT- I THINK IF IT. INVOLVES THE STATE AND- THE SIMILAR CAPACITY HERE YOUR RUNS NOW BUT IT WOULD HAVE GOT YOUR- THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL GO TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION- THE FROM THE- PLAY LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO YOUR NAME. FILIATION YOUR POSITION ON THE MATTER.

FOUR SIX ONE FOUR SIX NINE- WILL AUTHORIZE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO UTILIZE A RULE RATEMAKING PROCESS REFERRED TO AS THE COUPLING TO PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RECOMMENDS REMEMBER THAT I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE TODAY HOWEVER I WANT TO ASK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE TO OBTAIN MORE CERTAINTY THAT TO PC WILL ACTUALLY CONSIDER DECOUPLING ENTIRE LANGUAGE AROUND THE OVER COLLECTION AND- UNDER COLLECTION THE RATES CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. AND DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S GETTING WORSE ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AT THE LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY BY THE YEARS- THE TWENTY FORTIES SYRUP NO PACKED COULD ALL BUT DISAPPEAR AND CURRENTLY THE SIERRA SNOWPACK SUPPLIES ABOUT 30% A CALIFORNIA'S WATER CENTER BACKGROUND ARE PROUD TO AUTHORED SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE BECAUSE IT VANCE'S WATER CONSERVATION BY AUTHORIZING THE- UC TO IMPLEMENT. FOR DECADES OF SUCCESS IN ENERGY- UTILITIES HAVE- DONE WITH THE COUPLING SB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE ALLOWS WATER SUPPLIERS TO IMPLEMENT EQUITABLE RATE STRUCTURES FOR THOSE WHO USE MORE PAY MORE. IT ENABLES WATER SUPPLIERS TO MAINTAIN ROBUST SAVE OUR WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND ELIMINATE. INCENTIVES TO PROFIT BY SELLING MORE WATER. THE COUPLING SEVERS THE LINK BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT CUSTOMERS CHOOSE AND UTILITIES FINANCE INSTEAD OF REALIZING WINDFALL PROFITS WHEN CUSTOMERS USE MORE WATER UTILITIES ONLY RECOVER THE COSTS THE COMMISSION DETERMINES IS NEEDED TO OPERATE THEIR SYSTEMS IN SHORT THE COUPLING BREAKS THE DICTION. OF THE OUT TO WATER SEALS. FRENE UTILITY SUPPORTERS ON PROMOTING ROBUST WATER CONSERVATION OUT EFFORTS. ALL ONE RECENT PEER REVIEW STUDIES SHOW THAT THANKS TO COUPLING THE WATER SUPPLIERS REGULATED BY THE P. C. WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO MEET THEIR CONSERVATION GOALS AND THAT CONSUMERS SAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE WATER THAN THOSE WITHOUT TWO COPLINK TODAY TO TESTIFY AS RAMI COLIN. A DIRECTOR REGULATORY AFFAIRS CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICES AND A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE PC WATER DIVISION AND EVAN JACOBS DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CALIFORNIA WILL AMERICAN WATER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

OF WATER DIVISION AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR TWELVE YEARS THE RATIONALE FOR SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE BOILS DOWN TO TWO FACTORS WATER CONSERVATION AND AFFORDABILITY. CONSERVATION IS NO LONGER SOMETHING THAT WE PRACTICE DURING DROPS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IT MEANS IT'S NOW A DAILY IMPAIR IT. SB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE ADVANCES THAT GOAL BY ENABLING WATER UTILITIES COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICE KNOWN AS DECOUPLING. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING YOU SEE REGULATED UTILITIES ACHIEVE WATER CONSERVATION AFTER THE LAST DROP A PEER REVIEWED STUDY FOUND THAT THE P. C. REGULATED UTILITIES NOT ONLY SAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE WATER THAN. THEIR PUBLIC AGENCY COUNTERPARTS BUT ALSO WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO MEET CONSERVATION STANDARDS SET BY GOVERNOR BROWN SB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE ALSO ADVANCES THE STATE'S GOAL TO ENSURE WATER AFFORDABILITY. RECENT RATE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CUSTOMERS OF UTILITIES WITH THE COUPLE HAVE WATER BILLS THAT ARE UP 227% LOWER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL UTILITIES WOULD BE COUPLE ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRESSIVE RETURNS ENSURE EVERYONE IS CONTRIBUTING ACTIVELY TO THE COST OF OPERATING THE WATER SYSTEM. ENSURES THAT THOSE WHO USED MOST. ALSO PAID THE MOST. THANK REQUEST YEAR I VOTE ON THE SUPPORT TO HELP YOU THANK YOU KNOW WILL TO. JACOBS COLOR. AMERICAN WATER.
