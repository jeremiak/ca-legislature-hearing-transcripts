AWARE THAT THE- BUDGET. WILL

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.681
NOT BE OUR LAST ACTION THIS

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.583
YEAR. THERE ARE MANY THINGS

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.318
THAT WE CANNOT ADDRESS NOW THAT

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.053
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.489
THROUGH THE SUMMER. THESE

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:44.924
INCLUDE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.259
THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:48.294
COVERT NINETEEN AND HOPEFULLY

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.429
EXPLORING NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:53.432
TO INCREASE REVENUE TO SUPPORT

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:56.736
OUR STATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.971
WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.173
SENATOR NIELSEN TO PROVIDE

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.510
OPENING REMARKS SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.146
MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.048
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:12.852
THE PUBLIC. AS WE ROLLED INTO

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.187
THIS INSTITUTION IN JANUARY IT

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.123
LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE A-

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.525
FAIRLY REASONABLE YEAR THERE

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:22.662
WERE EVEN SOME HOPES. NOW THEY

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.598
HAVE BEEN DASHED AND NOW WE'VE

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:28.334
GOT MUCH MORE TO GRAPPLE WITH.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:28.768
ONE OF THE GREATEST

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.070
DIFFICULTIES HAS BEEN THE

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:33.439
CONTRACTION OF THE BUDGET

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:36.909
PROCESS. THE COLLAPSE OF THE

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:39.211
WORK OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES WOULD

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.447
BE OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS HAS

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.649
BEEN NOW COLLAPSED IN JUST A

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:47.486
FEW HOURS IN ONE COMMITTEE.

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:49.488
DOES IT LIMIT THE DEPTH OF

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.291
SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT THAT WE

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.962
NORMALLY CAN EXERT. SO THE CALL

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.631
TO US IS TO BE VIGILANT AS WE

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.800
REVIEW WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.135
AND THEN WHERE WE WILL BE GOING

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:05.104
AS HIS BUDGET MOVES OUGHT. THAT

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:09.775
IS A CHALLENGE. MAYBE NOT AS

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.578
MUCH AS PREVIOUSLY BUT YET IN

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.280
THIS BUDGET WE WILL BE DEALING

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:18.985
WITH NOW ARE SOME MAJOR MAJOR

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.620
POLICY DECISIONS. THAT REALLY

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.090
WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.859
KIND OF SCRUTINY AND REVIEW.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.695
THAT THEY WARRANT AND DEMAND.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.664
AND WE TRY TO POINT THOSE OUT

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:35.034
WHEREVER WE CAN. THE BURDEN IS

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:38.671
GREAT. BECAUSE THEY HILL WE

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:44.510
HAVE TO CLIMB. IS ALSO GREAT.

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.113
AS WE PROCEED HERE I WOULD

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.449
ADMONISHES TO KEEP IN MIND. NOT

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.717
JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:54.854
ROAD. BUT THE STRUCTURAL

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.822
CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE

00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:00.292
REQUIRED. US TO GET BACK ON

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.229
SOUND FOOTING NO MATTER WHAT

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.098
HAPPENS WITH THE ECONOMY. AND I

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.833
WOULD ARGUE HERE YET AGAIN AS

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.036
BEFORE WHEN WE HAD THE-

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:14.040
RECESSION. WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:18.878
TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL CONCERNS.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:22.048
BUT WE DID QUITE A LOT. IN THAT

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.749
PART OF IT ACTUALLY WAS ABOUT

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.619
THE ONLY PART THAT FELT GOOD.

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.554
IT APPEARS TO ME AND THIS.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.189
BUDGET THAT WE'RE MOVING AHEAD

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.626
WITH NOW. SOME OF THAT GOOD IS

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:37.163
GOING TO BE UNDONE. IN OTHER

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:40.433
WORDS EXACERBATING OUR

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:43.402
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM RATHER THAN

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.172
FURTHER ALLEVIATING. WE NEED TO

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.641
BE AWARE OF THAT. THEN IN SOME

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:50.476
CASES ACTUALLY ROLLING BACK

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.447
DECADES. OF CHANGE AND REFORM

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.615
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:59.919
THAT I WILL BE TO SOME DEGREE

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.588
COMPROMISED I FEAR. IN THE

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:06.258
BUDGET BEFORE US. YET AGAIN AS

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:08.494
AT OTHER TIMES WHEN WE FACE

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.763
THESE GREAT CHALLENGES. WE HAVE

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.501
COME TOGETHER REASONABLY. AND

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.604
DONE THE BEST WE CAN. IS THAT

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:22.475
ALL WE CAN ASK. NO WE SHOULD

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.444
ASK EVEN MORE OF OURSELVES. AND

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:30.282
BE MINDFUL AS WE- DELIBERATE.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:33.152
AND DISCUSS DEBATE AND VOTE.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:36.722
NOT WHAT IS FOR US TOMORROW.

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:38.357
MANY THINGS WE WILL BE VOTING

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:42.194
ON. WELL AFFECTED GENERATIONS.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:46.065
IN CALIFORNIA. WELL THE HARDEST

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:48.467
THINGS FOR US HERE TO DO. WHAT

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.336
KIND OF A ME NOW ME FIRST

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:54.440
SOCIETY ANYMORE GENERALLY. AND

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.710
THE DEMANDS OF THE PROCESS AND

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:58.277
THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:01.714
HAVE. DO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.849
ENVISION THE FUTURE IMPACT OF

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.718
THAT WHICH WE ARE VOTING ON. OR

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.287
ALTERING. OR DEBATING OR

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:11.524
SUPPORTING TODAY. AND I ALWAYS

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.793
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.695
THE IMPACT OF THIS. ON THE

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:20.833
GRAND CHILDREN TO THE FUTURE.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.668
WHERE I WOULD THEN CIRCLE BACK

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.938
TO THE NEED TO NOT FORGET THE

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.073
CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS WE'VE DONE

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.875
TO ASSIST US IN THE STRUCTURAL

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:33.979
DEFICIT. AND LET ME CLOSE ON A

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:38.817
NOTE. PROPOSITION ONE THE RAINY

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:43.255

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:46.892
OPPOSE. BUT IT GOT THROUGH THE

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.930
LEGISLATURE. GOVERNOR BROWN.

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:55.000

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:17.356
AND HELPFUL AND THEN THAT WE

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:19.158

FIRST PAGE OF THE SLIDES- I WAS

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:10.922
GOING TO BEGIN WITH FROM ONE OF

THE HIGHER LEVEL WILL REVIEW IT

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.459
SOME OF THE MAJOR AND MAJOR

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.695
ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE IN THE TWO

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:19.264
PACKAGES IN PARTICULAR I WOULD

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.134
COMMENT ON REVENUES BASS LINE

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.669
SPENDING. AND FEDERAL FUNDING

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.104
BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTIONS IN

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.339
THESE AREAS DIFFER IN THE TWO

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:30.375
PACKAGES SOME CASES- SO

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:32.244
BEGINNING WITH REVENUES-

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.212
ACTUALLY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.914
THEY DO PACKAGE OUR PACKAGES

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.849
ARE ACTUALLY LARGELY SIMILAR TO

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.819
ONE ANOTHER- PACKAGES MAKE

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:41.920
SIMILAR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:45.357
REVENUES AND- INCLUDE. AT THE

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:48.059
TOP. THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:50.695
MAY IN REVISION TO TEMPORARILY-

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:54.232
PRODUCED MORE REVENUE FOR THAT.

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:56.668
FOR THE- STATE IN THE NEXT

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:59.070
COUPLE OF YEARS- BUT THIS IS

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:01.540
DONE BY THE SPENDING THEY USE

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.842
THAT MOLD NET OPERATING LOSSES

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:07.345
BY BUSINESS. BUSINESS TAXPAYERS.

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:09.915
X. THREE YEARS AND ALSO BY

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:11.416
LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TAX

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:13.351
CREDITS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:14.486
BUSINESSES FOR THOSE YEARS AS

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:17.422
WELL. AND THAT'S ESTIMATED TO

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.358
AUGMENT THE REVENUE- PICTURE BY

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.194
ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.129
REGARDING SPENDING IT

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.231
PARTICULARLY IN THE BASELINE.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.533
THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE-

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.268
DIFFERS IN A NOTABLE WAY FROM

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.337
THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION I

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.039
THINK THIS SENATE PACKAGE

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:36.274
WOULD. LOOK TO OUR ESTIMATES

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:38.310
THE LA- ESTIMATES OF CASELOADS

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:41.680
BOTH IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.782
AND IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.151
MEDI CAL THE CASELOADS

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:47.519
THEMSELVES ACTUALLY ARE

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.521
RELATIVELY SIMILAR. BUT THE

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.157
COST PER CASE LOAD IS DIFFERENT

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:53.992
AND IN OUR THE ESTIMATES FROM

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:56.561
OUR OFFICE ARE ABOUT SEVEN

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:57.095
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:00.298
DOLLARS LOWER. THAN WHAT WAS IN

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.833
THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. IN

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.768
CAL WORKS THERE'S A FAIRLY

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.770
SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE JUST IN

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.505
A NUMBER OF CASELOADS OUR

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:09.241
OFFICE IS ACTUALLY ESTIMATES

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:11.409
THAT. CASE LOADS IN THE BUDGET

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:13.578
YEAR WILL BE LOWER THAN WHAT

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:16.281
THE NAY REVISION IS BUILT UPON

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.515
BY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:20.452
THOUSAND- CASELOADS. THAT

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.153
RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT TWO

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.122
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR A

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.691
COST DIFFERENCE IN SO SEVEN

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:28.927
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PLUS

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:29.628
THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION. A

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.763
SUM UP TO THAT THREE POINT SIX

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.299
BILL AND IN LOWER EXPENDITURES

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.802
THEN THE BASELINE UNDER THE

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.104
SENATE PACKAGE. WHEN IT COMES

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.007
TO FEDERAL FUNDING. THE TWO

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:44.042
PACKAGES ARE DIFFERENT IN

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.811
FUNDAMENTAL WAYS IN FACT THE

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.680
BASELINE ASSUMPTION AND FOR THE

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.115
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION AND THE

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.783
BASELINE ASSUMPTION REGARDING

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.752
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE SENATE

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.186
PACKAGE DIFFER SUCH THAT IT'S

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:57.555
ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO COMPARE

00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:59.658
THEM YEAH COMPARE THEM UNDER

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:02.193
BOTH OF THEIR BASELINE VERSIONS

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.764
SO WHAT I MEAN IS IN THE MAIL.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.398
IN THE NAY REVISION. THE

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:07.866
BASELINE IS THAT THERE IS NOT

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:08.867
GOING TO EIGHT ADDITIONAL

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.436
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FORTHCOMING.

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.305
AND THAT IS IT IN RECOGNITION

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.307
OF THAT IN THE LOWER REVENUE

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:18.143
EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:20.178
FROM THE RECESSION. MAY

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:21.479
REVISION WOULD IT INCLUDES

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:24.416
ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION AND A

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.351
REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET. NOW

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:29.220
THOSE REDUCTIONS WOULD BE A

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:32.524
RESTORED AND TRIGGERED OFF IF

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.226
THE STATE WERE TO REALIZE AN

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.262
ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION OR

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:39.698
SO THE FEDERALIST SYSTEMS BY

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:41.833
JULY FIRST. THE SENATE PACKAGE

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.135
ON THE OTHER HAND STARTS FROM

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:44.636
THE PREMISE THAT WE WILL

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:47.205
RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.975
ASSISTANCE AND SO THE BUDGET IS

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:52.377
FILLED WITH THAT- RESUMPTION IN

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:55.046
IN THE LINE. AND INSTEAD WHAT

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.781
IT WOULD DO IS IF IT DOES NOT

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:58.616
MATERIALIZE IT INCLUDES

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:01.219
TRIGGERS THAT WAY TO. OFFSET

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.321
THE MISSING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:05.457
IN THE EVENT THAT THAT'S NOT

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:08.126
AVAILABLE BY OCTOBER FIRST. SO

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.461
RATHER THAN COMPARE THE TWO

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:12.964
PACKAGES ON THEIR BASELINE-

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:14.766
ASSUMPTIONS I WILL ACTUALLY

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:15.967
COMPARE THEM THROUGH THE

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:18.236
BALANCE OF MY PRESENTATION IN

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:19.637
THIS IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:21.706
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AND

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.775
IN THE ALTERNATIVE WHERE THERE

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:27.345
IS NOT CONDITIONAL FEDERAL. SO

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:29.581
MOVES TO THE NEXT PAGE. AND

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.449
THIS IS WHERE WE DO MOVE INTO

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:32.684
THE DISCUSSION ON FEDERAL

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:34.652
FUNDING AND I'LL BEGIN WITH THE

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.254
CASE IN WHICH THERE IS

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.689
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:40.425
FORTHCOMING. IN THIS IN THIS

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.160
INSTANCE THE MAY REVISION IN

00:27:42.227 --> 00:27:43.461
THE SENATE PACKAGE ARE BROADLY

00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:45.797
SIMILAR- THERE ARE A FEW

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.832
DIFFERENCES ONE BEING THAT THE

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.234
SENATE PACKAGE WOULD WOULD END

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.136
THE- BUDGET YEAR WITH SLIGHTLY

00:27:51.202 --> 00:27:53.972
HIGHER TOTAL BUDGET RESERVES OF

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.373
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. BUT

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.674
THEN THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.076
ALSO REJECTS SOME OF THE NAY

00:27:58.143 --> 00:27:59.944
REVISION PROPOSALS AND IT ALSO

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.546
INCLUDES SOME AUGMENTATION

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.281
THEY'RE NOT IN THE MAYOR. SO

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:05.083
SOME OF THE ONES THAT. ARE

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.386
NOTABLE ARE- THE SIX HUNDRED

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:09.587
MILLION IN COUNTY REALIGNMENT

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:13.224
ASSISTANCE. AND THIS IS A- YOU

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.359
KNOW A RECOGNITION THAT THE

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:17.295
COUNTIES ARE LIKELY TO

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.097
EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT.

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:20.999
REDUCTION IN REALIGNMENT

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.033
FUNDING BECAUSE OF HE

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.568
RECESSION THAT ESTIMATES I

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:25.637
BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:28.073
REVISION THERE THAT IT BE IT-

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:30.608
SEVENTY IN PERCENT REDUCTION IN

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:33.445
THOSE REVENUES THE SENATE

00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.380
BUDGET PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:36.614
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:37.415
FOR LOCAL HOMELESSNESS

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.784
PROGRAMS. AND THEN FORTY TWO

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.453
MILLION FOR THE EARNED INCOME

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.855
TAX CREDIT EXPANSION IN THIS

00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:44.989
CASE IT WOULD BE EXPANDED TO

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:50.762
COVER. I TEN FILERS TAX FILERS.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:51.262
TAKING EARLY THOSE WITH

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:56.401
CHILDREN. AGES SIX AND UNDER.

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:59.404
NOW IF WE CAN SO THAT'S KIND OF

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.339
THE FROM THE NOTABLE WAYS IN

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:02.907
WHICH THEY DIFFER IF WE DO

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.209
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.544
FUNDING BUT THAT ACTUALLY A

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:08.546
FAIRLY SHORT LIST WHEN YOU

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:09.948
THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:11.683
THIS IS THE TWO PACKAGES ARE

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:13.485
REALLY QUITE DIFFERENT WHEN WE

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:16.654
GO TO THE OTHER SCENARIO WHERE

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.223
THERE IS NOT. FEDERAL BEING

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:22.961
FORTHCOMING SO FOR ALL MOVE NOW.

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:25.230
THE BEGINNING WITH REVENUES IN

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.265
THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOT IN

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.600
RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:31.336
AID THE NAY REVISION DOES NOT

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.370
REALLY PROPOSING NEED

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.906
ADDITIONAL. REVENUE INCREASES

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:36.341
THAT WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.475
WHETHER OR NOT WE GET THAT THAT

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:40.211
REALLY SO WE JUST GO AT WITH

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.747
THE REVENUE BASE AS IT. IS

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:44.015
SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE ON THE

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:46.284
OTHER HAND WOULD MAKE AN

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:47.785
ADJUSTMENT TO THE MANAGED CARE

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.554
ORGANIZATION TAX FOR THE NCO

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.923
TAX AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.560
THAT WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT ONE

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:56.161
BILLION A GENERAL FUND STATE.

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:59.764
I'M THE CHANGE. THE ADJUSTMENT

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.432
TO THE TAX SEEMS TO BE

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:04.836
CONSISTENT WITH CMS GUIDANCE

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.070
THAT CAME OUT ABOUT EIGHT

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:08.006
MONTHS AGO BUT IT WOULD BE

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:10.775
SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REVIEWER

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:17.448
FEDERAL APPROVAL. NOW MOVING TO

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.651
BUDGET RESERVE BIRDS THERE ARE

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:20.952
SOME DIFFERENCES HERE TO KNOW

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:22.520
BUT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN JUST WITH

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.422
THE PREFORMED HERE BECAUSE I

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.024
KNOW FROM ME CAN BE A LITTLE

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.927
BIT COMPLICATED AT TIMES. BUT

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:30.728
UNDER PROPOSITION TWO. UP TO

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:31.429
HALF OF THE BUDGET

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.097
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT CAN BE

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:35.667
WITHDRAWN AND THE FIRST YEAR.

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.834
GOVERNOR DECLARES A BUDGET

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.703
EMERGENCY. AND THE GOVERNOR CAN

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.605
DECLARE A BUDGET EMERGENCY WHEN

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.407
THERE'S A DISASTER AND

00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.374
TYPICALLY THINK YOU HAVE A

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.009
NATURAL DISASTER BUT IT COULD

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:49.714
BE. MAN MADE DISASTER OR- IN

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:51.316
THE CASE WHEN THERE IS A FISCAL

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:53.851
EMERGENCY AND FISCAL EMERGENCY

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.853
IS DEFINED AS A SITUATION IN

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.990
WHICH RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:01.426
AND UPCOMING YEAR ARE PROJECTED

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:04.295
TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:07.532
LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES YEAH.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.100
THERE WERE PROVIDED IN THE

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.935
HIGHEST OF THE LAST THREE

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:13.204
BUDGETS AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.707
THOSE MEASUREMENTS BY A

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:18.209
POPULATION AND INFLATION. SO

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.311
THAT'S SORT OF THE GROUND RULES

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:21.479
FOR USING THE BUDGET

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.982
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND JUST

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:25.950
TO KIND OF LEVEL SET HERE THE

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:28.853
BSA CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT SIXTEEN

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.955
POINT TWO BILLION IN. ERROR OF

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:33.057
THE BALANCE BUT IF YOU KNOW ON

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:35.994
THE SLIDE THE SENATE PLAN WOULD

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.563
BRING THAT DOWN TO NINE POINT

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.097
I'M SORRY TO SIX POINT SIX

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:41.099
BILLION. AND SO I THINK A FAIR

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:44.102
QUESTION IS WILL HOW IF YOU'RE

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:45.637
ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW HALF OF THE

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:46.804
BALANCE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.573
REDUCE IT BY NINE POINT SIX

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.008
BILLION SINCE NINE POINT SIX

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:51.843
BILLION AND MORE THAN HALF OF

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.911
SIXTEEN BILLION. AND THE REASON

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:56.414
IS IN RECENT YEARS THE

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:59.751
LEGISLATURE HAS NO PRUDENT WE-

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.419
MADE SIGNS SUPPLEMENTAL

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:04.522
OPTIONAL DEPOSITS TO THE BSA IN

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.791
THE YEARS IN WHICH WE'VE HAD.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.893
BUDGET SURPLUSES. AND THOSE

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.262
OPTIONAL SIR DEPOSITS SOME TO

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:12.730
ABOUT THREE BILLION.

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:15.166
INTERVIEWED AS A FULLY

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.334
AVAILABLE SO THOSE ARE NOT

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:19.337
SUBJECT TO THAT YOU KNOW WITH

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:19.937
FOR ALL OF HALF OF THE BALLOTS

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.106
RULE. SO WE TAKE THE THREE

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:23.908
BILLION AND THEN HALF OF WHAT'S

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.110
LEFT WHICH IS THIRTEEN BILLION

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:27.679
THAT SIX AND A HALF BILLION. IN

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:29.280
THAT ROOM REALLY BRINGS YOU TO

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.281
YOU KNOW THAT NINE AND A HALF

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.451
BILLION OR SO THAT IS BEING

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:36.521
UTILIZED UNDER THE SENATE PLAN.

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:42.327
SO NEXT- GO INTO LIVE BRIEF

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:44.262
DISCUSSION HERE OF HOW THE TWO

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:49.300
PLANS WOULD. USE THE COST SHIFT

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:52.370
OPTIONS. IN THE FISCAL OPTIONS

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:55.273
FOR THE STATE. IF YOU WOULD

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.808
ALLOW ME TO I WOULD DRAW YOUR

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:59.243
ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE LINE

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.278
THERE THAT SAYS REINSTATE

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.381
DEFERRALS AND IN THIS CASE NOT

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.849
TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL DEFERRALS.

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:07.218
REFERRING TO A DEFERRAL OF THE

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.153
JUNE PAYMENT ROLE PAYMENT THAT

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.489
GOES OUT TO STATE WORKERS. IN

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:12.690
THE FOURTH QUARTER CALPERS

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:16.227
CONTRIBUTION. THE JUNE PAVE

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:18.563
PAYROLL- DEFERRAL FOR STATE

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:21.165
WORKERS WE WOULD INVOLVE A

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:23.935
SHIFT OF THE FIGHT OF THE JUNE.

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:26.304
A ROLL PAYMENT GOING FROM LATE

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.373
JUNE TO EARLY JULY. THERE'S

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.274
ACTUALLY NO DELAY IN WHEN THE

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:30.908
WORKERS RECEIVED THEIR

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.710
PAYCHECKS BUT RATHER IT'S MORE

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:34.579
OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE BUT IT

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.247
DOES RESULT IN SHIFTING IT TO

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.349
THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR ON THAT

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:41.652
BASIS. AS FOR THE- DID THE

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.821
DEFERRAL OF THE CALPERS

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.390
CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FOURTH

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:48.292
QUARTER- PAYMENT FROM LATE JUNE

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:49.927
TO EARLY JULY. THERE IS AN

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.829
ACTUAL DELAY IN WHEN THE

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.664
PAYMENT IS MADE BY A FEW DAYS

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:56.300
BUT WE UNDERSTAND- FROM LOOKING

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:58.236
INTO IT THAT THERE'S NOT A

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.071
MATERIAL. IMPACT ON THE

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:02.240
CONDITION OF THE STATE'S

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:04.342
PENSION SYSTEM FROM THIS ACTION.

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:06.711
A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.479
HERE IS THAT THE DEFERRAL HOLES

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:10.982
IN THIS CASE APPLY TO BOTH THE

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:11.549
GENERAL FUND AND THE SPECIAL

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:14.652
FUNDS. AND THEN THERE'S THE

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.287
SAVINGS THAT ARE REALIZED ON

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:18.556
THE SPECIAL FUNDS SIDE WOULD BE

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.691
SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL FUND AND

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.493
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LINE

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.695
THEIR SPECIAL FUND LOANS IN

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.431
TRANSFER YOU'LL NOTE THAT THAT.

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.533
ITEM IS ONE POINT ONE BILL THE

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.835
ENTIRE IN THE SENATE PLAN THEN

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:31.402
IN THE GOVERNOR'S NEIGHBOR

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.004
VISION. AND THAT ONE POINT ONE

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.672
BILLION REALLY REPRESENTS THE

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.441
SAVINGS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:39.243
FROM THOSE DEFERRALS. BEING

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.346
SHIFTED INTO THE GENERAL FUND.

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:46.751
OKAY SO NOW I THINK A V. TOPIC

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.153
OF EDUCATION AND PROP NINETY

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.888
EIGHT IS AN ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.958
HERE TODAY SO I WILL NOT SPEND

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:54.525
A LOT OF TIME ON THIS BUT I

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:56.861
WILL TOUCH ON IT. SO WHEN IT

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.063
COMES TO FIND IN FOR THE

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.865
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.900
UNDER THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN IN

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.168
THE IN THE INSTANCE IN WHICH

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:05.736
THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.805
FUNDING. THERE IS NO REDUCTION

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.574
IS SCHOOL FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.777
COLLEGES. RATHER THE OVERALL

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:15.646
FUNDING LEVEL ACTUALLY GOES OUT

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.114
BY- IS EIGHT BILLION HIGHER

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.783
UNDER THE SENATE PLAN THEN

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.551
UNDER THE- GOVERNOR'S NAY

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.286
REVISION. THE WAY THAT THIS IS

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.489
ACHIEVED IS THROUGH A TWO POINT

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.723
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR HIGHER

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.458
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT-

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.961
GENERALS I'M PAYMENT. WHICH IS

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.729
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COLA.

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.764
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.000
THE GIRLS AT FOR THE SCHOOL

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.969
PAYMENTS NOW IN ADDITION TO THE

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:39.937
DEFERRAL. THE GOVERNOR IS

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.472
PROPOSING IN THE NAY REVISION.

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.441
THE SENATE PLAN WOULD ADD AN

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:46.210
ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.479
BILLION DEFERRALS. SO THAT THAT

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:49.847
THE TO THOSE TWO ITEMS THE TWO

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:51.249
POINT SEVEN BILLION IN HIGHER

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.184
PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.987
AND THE DEFERRAL SON TO EIGHT

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.522
BILLION AND THAT'S HOW. THAT IS

00:35:57.588 --> 00:36:02.927
PROVIDE IT. NOW FINALLY THIS

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.830
LAST PAGE. DISPLAYS RELEASE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.431
SOME OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.766
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.402
PACKAGES. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.471
A SCENARIO IN WHICH THERE IS NO

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:16.207
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID. THESE

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:18.042
ITEMS SHOWN ON THIS PAGE ROOM

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:20.244
THE WAY AT THE HEART OF THE

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:20.778
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:24.649
PACKAGES. YOU WOULD KNOW THAT-

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.350
THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE DOES

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:28.352
REJECT SOME OF THE NAY REVISION

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:32.056
PROPOSALS SUCH AS THE ONE POINT

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:34.559
TWO BILLION. CHANGE AND USE OF

00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:36.661
THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING SO

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:38.095
INSTEAD OF FUNDING GROW THROUGH

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.931
THE CONTINUE TO BE USED TO PAY

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:42.767
PROVIDER PAYMENTS. AND LIKEWISE

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.702
THE SENATE PLAN DOES REJECT THE

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.037
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IT

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.438
RELATES TO THE IN HOME

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.639
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT IS

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.575
WHICH- IN THE GOVERNOR'S NAY

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.710
REVISION WOULD REDUCE SERVICE

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:55.012
HOURS BY 7% SO YOU CAN SEE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.247
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS ON THE

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:59.917
LIST AS WELL. NOW THE QUESTION

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.953
IS HOW DOES THE SENATE PLAN DO

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.354
THAT AND IT'S REALLY WHAT I WAS

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.488
JUST DESCRIBING THROUGHOUT THE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.357
PREVIOUS SLIDES AND THEREFORE

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.758
WAYS TO THINK ABOUT AND

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.127
CATEGORICALLY. FIRST THE SENATE

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:11.662
PLAN IDENTIFIES A BIT OF NEW

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.598
REVENUE IN THE NCO TAX

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:17.668
ADJUSTMENT. IT ALSO USES THE

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:20.338
**** CASELOADS ON CAL WORKS IN

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.906
MEDI CAL WHICH LOWERS THE

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:24.108
SPENDING BASS. BUT THEN IT ALSO

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.810
DOES USE A BIT MORE OF THE

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.378
STATE'S RESERVES AND IT DOES

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.982
RELY MORE ON CAUTIOUS AND SOLD.

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.483
THOSE ACTIONS WHEN YOU PUT THEM

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.518
TOGETHER REALLY ARE WHAT THE

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:37.254
NAVAL THE STATE TO PRESERVE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.390
