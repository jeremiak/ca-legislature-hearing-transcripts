YOU COULD HEAR AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOW GOING TO BEGIN SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. I THINK YOU'RE MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- AB SEVEN FOUR EIGHT IS A MEASURE TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY -- IN A VERY NARROW SITUATION REGARDING POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BODY CAMERAS AS YOU KNOW -- WE AS A STATE AND MANY MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SIX COUNTIES HAVE STARTED TO INVEST A SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF BODY CAMERAS. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE A STATE WIDE POLICY OFFICE OF OFTENTIMES MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD HAVE ANY POLICY. AS TO WHEN A BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE CAN BE OR SHOULD BE. RELEASED WHAT WILL WE HAVE ON DOT IS AMEND THE BILL INTO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. AND DURING AN INVESTIGATION FORSTMANN AGENCIES GIVEN DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES ACTUALLY TELL THE PUBLIC WHY THE INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED AND JUST THE THE LANGUAGE FROM THE BILL. IS THAT. THE I. AGED AGENCY DEMONSTRATES BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT DISCLOSURE WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION. ON AND AGAIN -- REALLY WE WANT TO BALANCE THE ABILITY OF EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO DO THEIR JOB DO THE WORK BUT THE SAME TIME I BALANCE IT WITH THE PUBLIC'S DESIRE TO KNOW WHICH IS REALLY WHY -- WE HAVE AS A COMMUNITY MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. ARMED. THE I AB SEVEN FOR IT ALSO ONLY APPLIES. IN INCIDENT IN WHICH THE USE OF FORCE BUY PEACE OFFICER CRYSTAL OFFICER AGAINST A PERSON RESULTED IN DEATH OR IN GREAT BODILY INJURY SO WE DEFTLY HAVE -- NARROWED THE BILL SINCE WE FIRST -- INTRODUCED IT TWO YEARS AGO -- VERY MUCH THINK THAT THIS IS A A GOOD GOVERNMENT -- TRANSPARENCY MEASURE IT WAS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I DON'T HAVE TO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU NAM FIVE MINUTES TOTAL. CALL FOR QUORUM. JONES SAWYER HERE LACKEY HERE. CARRIER [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE OF KILEY QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO. MOST PRESIDENT YOU MOVE THE BELL. YOU MAY PAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S NIKKI MORE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION HARRIS CO SPONSORS OF AB SEVEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AND ALSO MENTIONED THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH I WAS ISSUED YESTERDAY THAT ANALYZE THE BILL AND NOTED. THAT THIS BILL REASONABLY PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS PRIVACY THERE ARE WE WENT TO GREAT PAINS TO TAKE CARE OF THE PRIVACY INTERESTS THAT ARISE WHEN YOU HAVE -- THIS DISCLOSURE OF THIS FOOTAGE IT ALSO -- SO IN OUR DEFINITION OF CRITICAL INCIDENT IS LIMITED TO ONLY THAT DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM OR A USE OF FORCE THAT RESULTS IN SERIOUS BODILY GREAT BODILY INJURY. OR DEATH AND THE INVESTIGATORY RECORDS EXEMPTION IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO THE REST OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WILL STAY AND TO PROVIDE OTHER EXEMPTIONS FOR NON DISCLOSURE SO. THIS IS ABOUT THE INVESTIGATORY INTEREST AND AT SOME POINT THE INVESTIGATORY INTEREST MUST AND AND THEN THIS INFORMATION CAN BE DISCLOSED BUT THERE ARE OTHER PRIVACY EXEMPTIONS IN ON IN THE LAW. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE LAW. ON AND THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER LAPD'S POLICY AND IT'S ACTUALLY GOES FURTHER TO PROTECT FROM DISCLOSURE INFORMATION THAN LA PEACE POLICY. SO I THINK IT'S A BALANCED MEASURE THE PROTECTS EVERYONE'S RIGHTS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS A TECHNICAL QUESTION TO BE HAPPENING TO THEM AND WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PETER BE BRING DIRECTOR POLICE PRACTICES FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. ARM IPAD CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WILL BE VERY BRIEF JUST TO SAY THAT THIS BILL IS NOW. NARROWLY FOCUSED ON CRITICAL INCIDENTS SO POLICE SHOOTINGS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF USE OF FORCE WITH HIS GREAT BODILY INJURY THOSE OF THE INCIDENTS THAT ARE -- MOST IMPORTANT THERE FOR A PUBLIC TRUST THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ACHIEVING A MEASURE OF TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMUNITIES -- AND THIS BILL IS NOW NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THOSE INCIDENTS -- AS MISS MORE MENTIONS OF IT IS. IT TRACKS THE LAPD POLICY IT IS WORKABLE AND IT ACCOUNTS -- FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION HAS A SYSTEM TO AVOID -- INTERFERENCE AND TO RESPECT PRIVACY AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN DISCOURSE ON ZILLOW HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WHEN THIS BILL LEFT THE ASSEMBLY IT WAS FAIRLY INNOCUOUS IT SAID IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BODY CAN'T YOU HAVE TO A POLICY ON THE LET ANYBODY LAW ENFORCEMENT CERTAINLY SHERSTON HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT BILL. GOT DRASTICALLY AMENDED IN THE SENATE OMINOUS NOW BEFORE YOU TODAY IN THIS FORM -- IT HAS BEEN NARROWED FROM THE FORM THAT PASSED THE SENATE OR FOR EXCUSE ME FROM THAT PASSED THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BUT NEVERTHELESS IS A FAR EXPANSION OF WHAT. LEFT THIS HOUSE INITIALLY -- UP I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS BILL REMOVES AGENCY DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT BODY CAM FOOTAGE SHOULD BE RELEASED WE THINK THAT DISCRETION PROPERLY LIES. WITH THE AGENCIES -- THEY ARE BEST SITUATED TO MAKE THAT DECISION -- THIS BILL WHILE IT ALLOWS. TWO ALLOWS ME TO SEE WITH HOLD DISCLOSURE -- FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS BUT AFTER THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS THE AGENCY IS REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE REQUEST FOR EVERY THIRTY TO EASE IN PERPETUITY UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO RELEASE THE FOOTAGE. AND SO BECOMES A PRETTY BURDEN SOME -- IMPACT IF THERE IS A IF THERE'S A REASON FOR THE FOOTAGE TO BE WITHHELD -- BE AGENCY HAS TO CONTINUALLY -- IT AGAIN IN PERPETUITY BY THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE NOT RELEASING IT AND THE REASON FOR THE WITHHOLDING. TOM BUT I THINK OVERALL WERE CONCERNED THAT OVER REGULATING BODY CAN USAGE -- COULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE DEPLOYMENT BODY CAMS AND BECAUSE THE AUTHOR OR THE COMMITTEE'S INTENT -- BUT WE WE FEAR THAT ITEM OVER REGULATION OF THIS UP AND COMING TECHNOLOGY -- COULD RESULT IN AGENCIES DECIDING NOT TO DEPLOY -- THOSE SYSTEMS AND WE THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES MORE IN CHAIR MEMBER SEAN ON WITH CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION WITH WITH SUMMERS SIMILAR SENTIMENTS TO OUR MR SOUTH THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE REGULATION OF BODY CAMS. AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE ACTUALLY WERE USING BODY COMES LONG BEFORE YOU EVER HEARD OF YOU KNOW BOB FERGUSON OR TRAYVON MARTIN ARE. A LOT OF THOSE NATIONWIDE DE EVENTS. SO THAT THE DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY IS THERE DESPITE -- SOME SENTIMENT TO THE CONTRARY BUT THE APPROACH -- TO IT WITH THIS BILL -- IMMIGRANTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES NEED TO WORK WITH THERE A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE PROPER HANDLING AND RELEASE OF EVIDENCE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS SAYS. DESPITE SOME OF THE NARROWING OF OF THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL INCIDENTS WE STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH WITH -- THE NON DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY INTERFERE DURING THE FORTY FIVE DAYS AND AFTER -- AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT UNDUE BURDEN -- ON THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN AND HOW THE DO WITH THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NATIONAL CURRENT MEMBERS PART NAME AN ORGANIZATION AS CHAIR REMEMBERS RAINY PERRY -- WITH VARYING ASSOCIATES UP HALF A POOR AND COMFORT ASSOCIATION A PATROL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NOT RECYCLING ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHARES BOTH OPPOSED THANK YOU [inaudible] EDU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MERSHON OFTEN WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ALSO WITH A ON THE HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION TODAY. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU RIGHT. CHARACTER ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISTER QUIRK SO I TRIED THIS A COUPLE YEARS AGO I THINK THIS IS A ARE. A GOOD BILL. ARM I THINK IT'S MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN MINE IT WAS AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY IT'S GOT AS FAR AS IT IS LET'S GET IT OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. KAMLAGER-DOVE. I THINK YOU -- I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS SO IF THERE IS PENDING LITIGATION -- THE VIDEO RECORDINGS WOULD NOT BE RELEASE IS THAT TRUE OR NOT. WE WE DEFIANCE PENDING INVESTIGATION. AND WHAT THAT BUT THERE HAS TO BE IS TO HAVE TO BE -- THAT HAS TO COME THAT THE AGENCY HAS COME FORWARD AND TELL US WHY. RIGHT THEY HAVE TO PROVE TO THE PUBLIC THAT THERE IS A SPECIFIC REASON WHY. A WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PLACE IS THE PROPER AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY IN THE AGENCY CONTROL -- WE ALSO -- THE STATEMENT POLICY IS IN MY OPINION MORE PERMISSIVE THEM BUT THE LA POLICE COMMISSION ADOPTED. A WHICH DOES ACTUALLY -- SET A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME FOR WE DID NOT DO THAT IN THIS IN THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO -- NGUYEN TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AND THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION IT IS TRUE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO RELEASE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION THAT PUT POLICE OFFICERS IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE FOR A REASON WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE NEIGHBORS. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT I'M ESPECIALLY IN HIGH PRICE PROFILE. INCIDENTS -- WORDS. THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER. CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HAD IT'S A WAY FOR THE PUBLIC -- TO JUST HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION AND SO WOULD YOU KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT I THINK THAT'S UPS ARISES SO ON DID THIS HAS BEEN A TO YOUR BILL SO I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORK ON FOR TWO YEARS. HAVE HAD -- INTO MONTHS AND MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION TO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE DISCUSSION THAT HAS GONE ON AT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY WHY WE NARROWED -- SITS AB SEVEN FOUR EIGHT TO SPECIFICALLY USE OF FORCE -- AND TO ONLY ON STATEWIDE IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE WAS NOT FOR EVERY SINGLE. TYPE OF SITUATION THAT IS GOING ON PER BELIEVE FOR THE SITUATIONS THAT PROBABLY HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT COMMUNITY INTEREST [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] GREW [inaudible] CARE. SOMETHING ON YES HELLO GOOD MORNING -- AS A FORMER JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN COVERING -- SOME OF THAT THE RISE AND SOCIAL MEDIA POLICE SHOOTINGS AND HOW THE PUBLIC -- INTERPRETS THAT INFORMATION I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT I'M ALSO PROUD TO SEE I'M ALSO HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE CO SPONSORS OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. AND ONE OF THE OTHER SUPPORTERS IS THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME IN WHICH THE GENERAL PUBLIC ITS INFORMATION RAPIDLY. AND SO THE WAY IN WHICH THE RESPONSIBLE NEWS MEDIA TELLS THOSE STORIES AND HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO BE MORE INFORMED. INFORMED OPINIONS. THAT -- CAN ACTUALLY GET TO AN END RESULT VERSES SOME OF NOT KNOWING UNKNOWN CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROTESTS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE STREET ON THE THE TENSION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CARE ABOUT WE WANT TO ECHO. MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS WE ALL BELIEVE THAT ONE IS THERE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME IN WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN HOW THE STORIES ARE TOLD SO I I I AM I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP SOME OF THE CASES TRAYVON. MARTIN UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT A TO YOUR POINT WAS NOT A CASE IN WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS INVOLVED THAT WAS A CIVILIAN THAT FELT THAT A YOUNG BOY CARRYING A CAN OF I STIAN SKITTLES WAS A THREAT TO HIS LIFE AND FLORIDA'S STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT I THINK ABOUT THE CASES OF FREDDIE GRAY. IN BALTIMORE I THINK ABOUT. A OF THE CASES IN NEW YORK WITHOUT HIM THE GENTLEMAN WHO SAID I CAN'T BREATHE ERIC. ERIC GARDNER THANK YOU. AND OF THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT CASES THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN BALD. THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND IF WE HAD. THE LAW IF WE HAVE THE BODY CAMERA. FOOTAGE THAN MAYBE THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND WE'D GONE TO A DIFFERENT SPACE BUT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE INFORM THE PUBLIC AND HOW WE MAKE [inaudible] DECISIONS. THAT -- BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY AND AND THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA WORKS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW RESPONSIBLE WE ARE PLEASED A ROLE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND SO. I'LL BE VOTING YES ON THIS BILL I THINK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER CHENEY WITHOUT DISRESPECT RESTAURANT OUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS TO QUESTIONS TODAY. AND THANK YOU SHOOTING YOU KNOW IT WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED. I EVEN THOUGHT OF MY OWN BODY CAM. POLICY AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD AND I WANTED I WANTED TO PUT FORWARD. WAS THE AGREEMENT WILL BE BETWEEN MY OWN CITY THE LOS ANGELES -- POLICE COMMISSION AND A LOS ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT -- WAY OF IMPLEMENTING BODY CAMERAS AND A WHOLE POLICY. OF I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO MOVE FORWARD A LOT OF PEOPLE BEAT ME TO THE GUN. BUT IT IT IT SHOWED ME AT THAT TIME WE WE COULD HAVE A GOOD DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. I ALSO REMEMBER AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WERE HERE BEFORE GIVES DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW COSTLY IT WAS HOW WE COULDN'T -- KEEP INFORMATION AND AND THAT DEPARTMENTS WOULDN'T IMPLEMENT. DEPARTMENTS ARE IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT A LAW. WITHOUT HIS FORTUNE AND MATCH TO ME I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY GREAT THAT REMOVING. FOR WHAT WAS MISSING STATEWIDE GUIDELINE. AND AND ALTHOUGH JUSTICE MAY NOT BE THAT MAY NOT GONE AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE. I THINK IT HAS BEEN WATERED DOWN THERE'S A THERE'S A DISTANT THINGS IN HERE I THINKHELP BOTH SIDES I'VE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT BECAUSE OF BODY CAMERAS -- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES WHO'VE BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED. OF CRIMES CAN NOW PROVE. BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT THEY DID NOT USE RACIAL EPITHET THEY DID NOT BEAT SOMEONE OR THAT. THEY DID NOT. IT WOULD NOT OUT OF POLICE POLICY BECAUSE THEY CAN NOW SEE THE BODY CAM -- FOOTAGE AND SO I THINK IT WORKS BOTH WAYS ON TO PROTECT OFFICERS AND ALSO TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND THEN LASTLY AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS I I CAN TELL LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL. WE MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PROTECTION OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OUR OUR FAMILIES. AND ON PAGE SEVEN WHERE YOU WRITE WHAT YOU HAVE ON IF TO SUBJECT WHOSE PRIVACY IS TO BE PROTECTED. IS DECEASED. AND AIR BENEFICIARY DESIGNATED IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER AUTHORIZED LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE DID TO SEE SUBJECT WHOSE PRIVACY. IS TO BE PROTECTED. THOSE OF US WHO'VE HAD OUR PRIVACY. BECAUSE OF STANCES WE'VE TAKEN ON CERTAIN LAWS AND HAVE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. I WOULD YOU SAY TORTURE OR GONE AFTER SEE THE MADERA FACES ON THE INTERNET WE KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE AND SO WE WOULD NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SO IN MANY WAYS WE SHARE. A LOT OF THESE PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS WITH THAT THE CHAIRS RECOMMEND AYE VOTE -- AYE AYE. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK WE DO HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF FORMERLY FROM ALONG. VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO TO DO GIDDINESS THEIR CALDERON.
