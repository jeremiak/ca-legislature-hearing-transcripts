AN ANTIDOTE OF OF THE WAY BART

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.386 region:rollup2
AND THE CITY'S WORK TOGETHER BUT

00:54:47.818 --> 00:54:50.721 region:rollup2
ALSO MENTIONED IN THE MIDST OF A

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:52.222 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS.

00:54:50.721 --> 00:54:53.423 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:54.825 region:rollup2
TAKE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:56.827 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY UNIQUE

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:58.929 region:rollup2
SUCH AS WHAT WE FIND WITH BART

00:54:56.827 --> 00:55:00.597 region:rollup2
AND BARK OWNED PROPERTY.

00:54:58.929 --> 00:55:02.599 region:rollup2
IN THE MIST OF CITIES IN A

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:04.735 region:rollup2
THREE COUNTY AREA WHERE IT WHERE

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:05.903 region:rollup2
EVERY AREA THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

00:55:04.735 --> 00:55:08.305 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY AN

00:55:05.903 --> 00:55:10.240 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIAL WHERE FOLKS

00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:12.209 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS STILL HAVE. PLENTY

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.777 region:rollup2
OF OUR ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT AS

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
WELL AS TO HAVE REPRESENTATION

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:19.116 region:rollup2
BY VOICE ON A BOARD THAT IS

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:20.584 region:rollup2
p JUST FOR INFORMATION I THINK

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:22.085 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTHY TO NOTE.

00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:24.021 region:rollup2
THAT THE LARGEST CITY IN MY

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:27.291 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:29.660 region:rollup2
THAT OF THIS WHAT IMPACT.

00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:31.762 region:rollup2
ONLY INCREASED A NET INCREASE OF

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.997 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND NINE LIVING UNITS

00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:35.299 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:36.567 region:rollup2
AND IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING

00:55:35.299 --> 00:55:38.035 region:rollup2
CRISIS THIS IS NOT MEETING THE

00:55:36.567 --> 00:55:39.937 region:rollup2
NEED.

00:55:38.035 --> 00:55:41.438 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WONDER WHY OUR HOUSING

00:55:39.937 --> 00:55:43.207 region:rollup2
IS GOING UP AS HIGH AS IT IS

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:44.975 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE CITIES THAT ARE

00:55:43.207 --> 00:55:46.210 region:rollup2
ONLY PRODUCING A NET INCREASE

00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:48.245 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:50.681 region:rollup2
FINANCES HOUSING ESTIMATES.

00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:52.716 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THAT OF THE CONCERN

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:54.918 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN EXPRESSED THAT OF BART

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:56.253 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT WORK OR WOULD HAVE

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:58.121 region:rollup2
STRAINED RELATIONS WITH LOCAL

00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:59.990 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES AND AGENCIES. IN

NOT HERE BUT BUT I WOULD THINK

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:51.041 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:53.343 region:rollup2

IT ANYTHING ONE AT THAT WELL I

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.780 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THEY

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:58.882 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.951 region:rollup2
THE THE COUPLE OF ENTITIES THAT

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:03.153 region:rollup2
HAVE. POSED AT THIS POINT THIS

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:04.120 region:rollup2
ONLY APPLIES TO BART ONLY AND SO

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:06.122 region:rollup2

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:22.072 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT IF WE PUT HOUSING ON

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.573 region:rollup2
PARKING LOTS THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.574 region:rollup2

I STILL.

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:30.166 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MENTION WAS MADE THAT

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:33.069 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE. TWENTY THOUSAND

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:34.104 region:rollup2

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:38.775 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.576 region:rollup2
NOT VERY HIGH NUMBER CONSIDERING

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.912 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF UNITS HE WOULD

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:46.883 region:rollup2
THE NEED THAT EXISTS THERE.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:48.485 region:rollup2
.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.452 region:rollup2
THE WHEN I LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:53.690 region:rollup2
FOUR AND HALF MILLION SQUARE

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:56.326 region:rollup2
FEET OF COMMERCIAL.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:57.327 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE GOING IN.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.262 region:rollup2
I WONDER WHERE EVERYONE'S GOING

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:00.363 region:rollup2
TO PARK.

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.631 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NOTHING FROM A LAND

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:03.867 region:rollup2
USE

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:06.236 region:rollup2
I KIND OF I JUST I GUESS I IT

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:08.538 region:rollup2
FEELS AS THOUGH THIS IS BEING

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:10.206 region:rollup2
PRESENTED AS A WAY TO. SOLVE THE

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:12.575 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS.

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:14.344 region:rollup2
IN THE BAY AREA OR AT LEAST

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:16.012 region:rollup2
MAKE A DENT IN IT AND I JUST.

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:17.614 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.948 region:rollup2
CASE I THINK THE POLICIES THAT

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:20.250 region:rollup2
ARE PUT IN PLACE BY THIS

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:22.185 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THE REASON FOR THE

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.820 region:rollup2
HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND THE

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:26.022 region:rollup2
HIGH COST OF LAND AND THE IT

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.991 region:rollup2
INABILITY TO TO BUILD MORE

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:28.591 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I DON'T

01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:30.860 region:rollup2
THINK TAKING THE PARKING LOTS

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:31.895 region:rollup2
AWAY. FROM BART IS GOING TO

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.597 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:36.466 region:rollup2
.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:38.268 region:rollup2
BUT BONUS POINTS FOR BEING.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.602 region:rollup2
CREATIVE. AND HOW YOU'RE

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.236 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THIS PROBLEM BUT I'M

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.205 region:rollup2
FOR CHECK CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:44.340 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:45.308 region:rollup2
BUT I AM A A DEFERRED TO THE

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.242 region:rollup2
PARK DIRECTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:49.345 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON THIS BUT ALSO A FEW

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:50.513 region:rollup2
THINGS WE WE ARE NOT CLAIMING

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.981 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:55.485 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO THINK. THAT TWENTY

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:57.086 region:rollup2
THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING ON TOP

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:58.354 region:rollup2
OF SURFACE PARKING LOTS IS A

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.589 region:rollup2
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.423 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE FIRST THOUGHT THE

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:03.226 region:rollup2
SECOND IS.

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:05.728 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT REMOVING PARKING

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:07.597 region:rollup2
SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR HOUSING

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:09.332 region:rollup2
A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO GO UP

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:10.834 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF A PARKING LOT BUT YOU

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:12.268 region:rollup2
COULD BUILD A PARKING GARAGE YOU

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:14.137 region:rollup2
CAN STILL. ALLOW FOR PARKING

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:15.638 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH OUR HOPE IS WITH TWENTY

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:17.040 region:rollup2
THOUSAND UNITS THEY'RE BUILT

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.341 region:rollup2
RIGHT ON TOP OF BART STATIONS

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.842 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DOES AT LEAST

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.543 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:22.178 region:rollup2
PARKING.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:24.280 region:rollup2
OF THE FOLKS WHO LIVE.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:25.248 region:rollup2
A WHO LIVE RIGHT THERE SO WE

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.549 region:rollup2
COULD STILL ALLOW FOR PARKING I

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:27.917 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOVE TO TURN IT OVER TO

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:29.319 region:rollup2
MISTER JOSEPH WHAT'S BECAUSE I

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.687 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS IS BEN AND. A

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:32.488 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THAT I JUST DO YOU

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:35.158 region:rollup2
KNOW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RIGHT

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:36.993 region:rollup2
NOW WHO WANT HOME. IN YOUR AREA

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:38.328 region:rollup2
BUT CAN'T FIND ONE OR CAN'T

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.996 region:rollup2
AFFORD ONE.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:42.699 region:rollup2
PLAN EVER EXPECT YOU TO KNOW

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.366 region:rollup2
THE EXACT NUMBER DISEASE.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.734 region:rollup2
I WITH MY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.702 region:rollup2
THINK YOU THIRDS OF THE BAY AREA

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:47.203 region:rollup2
IS STRUGGLING WITH OR ELSE

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.738 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:50.039 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY AND I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:51.140 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SO AGAIN I'M NOT

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.275 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.477 region:rollup2
AND THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT I

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:55.578 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS. A VERY TAYLOR

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:57.447 region:rollup2
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:59.349 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT TAKES A STEP IN THE

01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:00.483 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION TO DO THE KIND

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.285 region:rollup2
OF TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:04.187 region:rollup2
WE WANT. AND AND THIS ONLY

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:05.255 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES PART OWN LAND IF YOU

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.123 region:rollup2
KNOW BUT THERE ARE OTHER

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:09.659 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS OUT THERE THAT WOULD

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:12.228 region:rollup2
IMPACT. A MORE LAND AROUND

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.829 region:rollup2
TRANSIT STATIONS THAT IS NOT

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.329 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS MEANT TO

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.831 region:rollup2
BE.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:17.200 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY CARVED OUT PROPOSAL

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:19.102 region:rollup2
AROUND PARTLY.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.370 region:rollup2
RIGHT THANK YOU.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:21.971 region:rollup2
MYTHS AND MIS EGGMAN THEN MR

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.506 region:rollup2
ACOSTA.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:25.708 region:rollup2
AT NIGHT.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:27.443 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.946 region:rollup2
CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:32.282 region:rollup2
ABOUT SO FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:34.050 region:rollup2
LIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:35.852 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE AROUND THE BAY AREA.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.288 region:rollup2
.

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:40.723 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF IF IF PEOPLE

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:42.392 region:rollup2
REALIZED WIN IT TWENTY THOUSAND

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.893 region:rollup2
UNITS OF HOUSING FREES UP A LOT

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:45.929 region:rollup2
OF THINGS BECAUSE IF THERE'S NOT

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:47.697 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR PEOPLE LIVE.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:49.732 region:rollup2
THEY THEN GO TO ADJACENT

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:51.367 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.235 region:rollup2
AND FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKE

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.436 region:rollup2
REPREHENSIBLE PRESENT STOCKTON

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:55.371 region:rollup2
THROUGH AB.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:56.940 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT TIME WHEN BEFORE

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.841 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY MOVED TO STOCKTON

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.443 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE HOUSING PRICES

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.978 region:rollup2
IT CRASHED WE WENT INTO

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:03.580 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY A PART OF THAT WAS

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:05.515 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE INABILITY OF THE BAY

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.016 region:rollup2
AREA TO BE ABLE TO CREATE ANY

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:09.218 region:rollup2
KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:11.187 region:rollup2
SO PEOPLE CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:12.155 region:rollup2
INTO THE VALLEY AND THEN. AND

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
THEN CAME BACK.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:14.090 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.625 region:rollup2
BUT

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:18.094 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:20.296 region:rollup2
IN THE BAY AREA CREATES A HUGE.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:22.131 region:rollup2
CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT GOES ALL

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.366 region:rollup2
THE WAY INTO THE VALLEY UP AND

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:25.134 region:rollup2
DOWN AND INCREASES TO THEM.

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:27.170 region:rollup2
RAISE UP OUR HOUSING COSTS AND

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:28.938 region:rollup2
CREATE LESS PLACES FOR OUR FOLKS

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.174 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE LIVE WHO MAKE UP

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.842 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES OF THE. UP AND A LOT

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:35.244 region:rollup2
LESS PEOPLE DO IN THE BAY AREA.

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:37.246 region:rollup2
SO ANY KIND OF WAY THAT WE CAN

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:38.348 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE TO ADDRESS IS VERY

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:39.949 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND I

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:40.717 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.784 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE. IN

01:08:40.717 --> 01:08:42.986 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR ANYWHERE

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:44.754 region:rollup2
AROUND THE BAY AREA TO

01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:46.589 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:47.690 region:rollup2
IT HAS WHEN THE BAY AREA DOESN'T

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:49.158 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.760 region:rollup2
HOUSING AT A RATE. OF THE PEOPLE

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.761 region:rollup2
CAN AFFORD.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.463 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ENTIRELY RIGHT AND I'LL

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:55.031 region:rollup2
SAY IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS

01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:57.166 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS AROUND IS THE

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:58.434 region:rollup2
STATUS QUO ACCEPTABLE OF THESE

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:59.502 region:rollup2
TWO OR FIFTY ACRES WHERE WE'RE

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:01.137 region:rollup2
NOT BUILDING ANY HOUSING AND ARE

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.271 region:rollup2
JUST SURFACE PARKING LOTS. OR

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.706 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE BUILD SOMETHING ON TOP

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.174 region:rollup2
OF THEM I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.909 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T DO IT IN A CAR IN A

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:08.277 region:rollup2
TARGETED WAY. AYE AND THE STATUS

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.512 region:rollup2
QUO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT TO

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.279 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT.

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:11.114 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.082 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:15.184 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:16.552 region:rollup2
WORKING IN THE HIGH COST CENTERS

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:19.022 region:rollup2
OF THE CITIES IN THE BAY WERE

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:20.256 region:rollup2
DRIVING TWO THREE FOUR HOURS A

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:22.025 region:rollup2
DAY COMMUTING FROM YOUR PART OF

THE STATE. UP WHO ARE OUR

TEACHERS ARE CHILDCARE WORKERS

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.462 region:rollup2
ARE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.998 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE RETAIL

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:30.033 region:rollup2
WORKERS AND THAT'S NOT JUST A

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:32.201 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:34.137 region:rollup2
BUT IT EXACERBATES. THE

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:35.705 region:rollup2
CONGESTION CRISIS GREENHOUSE

01:09:34.137 --> 01:09:37.573 region:rollup2
GASES WHAT THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:40.209 region:rollup2
CARES ABOUT.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:41.644 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT MR ACOSTA.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2

WE OFTEN STE

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:50.453 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE WITH THE DO SOMETHINGS

01:09:49.052 --> 01:09:51.821 region:rollup2
IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE SEQUEL

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:54.757 region:rollup2

AND EXEMPTIONS.

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:59.062 region:rollup2
PART LABOR WEEK IT SEEMS LIKE.

01:09:56.225 --> 01:10:00.963 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A PART OF THE THE

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:02.198 region:rollup2
ISSUE WE ALSO HAVE A NIMBY ISSUE

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.032 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE IT

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:05.168 region:rollup2
WHERE I LIVE.

STOCKINGS COMMENTS SAID IT'S

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.409 region:rollup2
NOT IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:15.044 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT WE

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:17.180 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE OVER

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:19.315 region:rollup2
PRICED HOUSING. YOU KNOW THAT

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.750 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TRYING TO FLEET FOR A LOT

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.951 region:rollup2
OF REASONS BUT ONE OF THEM IS

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.152 region:rollup2

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY I'M

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:57.993 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE THAT.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.828 region:rollup2
THAT ATTORNEYS FEES ARE ONLY

01:24:57.993 --> 01:25:01.430 region:rollup2

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:02.831 region:rollup2

HAVE GONE THROUGH ON THE MERITS

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:06.134 region:rollup2

IS THAT COVERED UNDER THIS BILL

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:17.179 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.614 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT ANY

01:25:17.179 --> 01:25:19.848 region:rollup2
GROUPS OUT THERE WHO ARE LOOKING

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:22.184 region:rollup2

ENVIRONMENT.

01:25:25.988 --> 01:25:30.092 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE DISCOURAGED BY THIS

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:31.393 region:rollup2
BILL OFF FOR SOME CASES YOU HAVE

01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:34.062 region:rollup2

PROVIDED THAT THEY.

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.667 region:rollup2

GET ATTORNEY'S FEES THEY WENT UP

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:42.104 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR SOME ORGANIZATIONS

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:44.239 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE. LIMITING THEIR

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:45.207 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO USE THE LAW TO

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
ENFORCE THE RIGHT OR MAKE IT

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:47.943 region:rollup2
HARDER TO FIND ATTORNEY.

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.611 region:rollup2
MEANING THAT THOSE WHO JUST

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:50.879 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD ACCESS TO JUSTICE

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:54.182 region:rollup2
WILL LOSE THAT RIGHT.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:54.750 region:rollup2

BENEFIT THE PROBLEM THAT ARISES

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.993 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.560 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT IS

WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THE

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.063 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:30.398 region:rollup2
SUCH A BROAD THINK IT IMPACTS

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:31.1000 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY SO JUDGES HAVE

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:33.702 region:rollup2
STRUGGLED AND THERE ARE VARYING.

01:29:31.1000 --> 01:29:35.637 region:rollup2
DEGREES OF.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:37.072 region:rollup2
RESULTS ON THESE CASES BECAUSE

01:29:35.637 --> 01:29:38.640 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE LOOKS AT A

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:40.275 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUITS AS WELL

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.243 region:rollup2

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:46.548 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THESE LAWSUITS ARE

01:29:44.179 --> 01:29:48.116 region:rollup2
PURELY FOR PRIVATE GAIN AND THEY

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:51.052 region:rollup2
ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:52.754 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S DIFFICULT.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:54.623 region:rollup2
FOR THE JUDGES TO WEIGH THAT AND

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:56.625 region:rollup2
I'D.

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:57.926 region:rollup2
FEEL AS THOUGH THIS WOULD GIVE

THEM MORE DIRECTION AS TO WHEN

01:29:57.926 --> 01:30:01.129 region:rollup2
IT IS APPROPRIATE.

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:02.030 region:rollup2
FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:06.301 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFIT VERSUS THE

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:08.003 region:rollup2
PRIVATE BENEFIT.

BELIEVE ANYBODY SITTING ON THIS

01:30:40.235 --> 01:30:43.505 region:rollup2

BILL THIRTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT

01:38:55.463 --> 01:38:58.199 region:rollup2
WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:00.034 region:rollup2
ABSENCE OF AVAILABLE MARKET

01:38:58.199 --> 01:39:01.569 region:rollup2

THIS HAS RATES GREAT CONCERNS

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:13.881 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CHINA HAD BEEN THE

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:16.050 region:rollup2
LARGEST WORLD MARKET FOR MANY OF

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:17.485 region:rollup2

NOT ANTICIPATE AND THAT

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:22.523 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR.

01:39:20.755 --> 01:39:24.158 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW REQUIRES EACH LOCAL

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:25.626 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION TO DIVERT FIFTY

IF THEY'RE DISPOSABLE DISPOSAL

01:39:35.837 --> 01:39:38.439 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY LEADS THEM TO DIVERT

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:40.007 region:rollup2

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:41.976 region:rollup2

01:39:54.489 --> 01:39:58.259 region:rollup2
IF THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET CAN

01:39:56.290 --> 01:40:00.294 region:rollup2
BE CONSIDERED AS A GOOD. FAITH

01:39:58.259 --> 01:40:01.996 region:rollup2
EFFORT THE LAW ALSO DOES NOT

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:03.364 region:rollup2
TAKE MARKET FAILURE INTO ACCOUNT

01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:05.333 region:rollup2

TO DO SO UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:23.184 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE TEMPORARY

WORK DILIGENTLY TO IDENTIFY

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:35.042 region:rollup2
MARKETS BUT FOR THOSE SITUATIONS

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:37.011 region:rollup2
WHERE DESPITE THOSE EFFORTS

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:38.245 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO MARKET.

01:43:37.011 --> 01:43:39.713 region:rollup2
OUR APPEAL TO YOU TODAY IS TO

IS THE AUTHOR INDICATED WITH A

01:43:41.015 --> 01:43:44.085 region:rollup2
NEW SET OF AMENDMENTS WE'VE

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:45.252 region:rollup2
AGREED TO IN CONCEPT.

01:43:44.085 --> 01:43:46.220 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE LANGUAGE REFER TO

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:47.822 region:rollup2
COURSE YET BUT.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:49.323 region:rollup2

01:43:47.822 --> 01:43:50.391 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE RELIEF IN THE BILL

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:52.660 region:rollup2
THE RELIEF FROM PENALTY

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:53.060 region:rollup2
PROVISION IS ONE OF THE.

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.162 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT.

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:57.264 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE. PROVISIONS OF VOTES

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:58.766 region:rollup2
COMING OUT SO WHAT'S LEFT.

01:43:57.264 --> 01:44:00.301 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO AREAS IN LAW

01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:01.569 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WERE CAL RECYCLE

01:44:00.301 --> 01:44:03.571 region:rollup2
FOLLOWS A LIST OF CRITERIA IN

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:04.905 region:rollup2
MAKING DECISIONS.

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:05.339 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE HAS TO DO WITH A

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.807 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:08.275 region:rollup2
TERMINATION.

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:09.310 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND ONE WHICH FOLLOWS

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.911 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE NOT FOUND TO BE A

01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:12.146 region:rollup2
GOOD FAITH THE CALVIN CYCLE THEN

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:14.115 region:rollup2
DECIDES BASED ON CERTAIN

01:44:12.146 --> 01:44:15.916 region:rollup2
CRITERIA. WHETHER OR NOT A

01:44:14.115 --> 01:44:17.852 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE ORDER WILL ISSUE.

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:19.854 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BILL ASKS IS THAT IN

01:44:17.852 --> 01:44:21.889 region:rollup2
EITHER IN BOTH CASE BOTH CASES

01:44:19.854 --> 01:44:23.124 region:rollup2
MARKETS BE CONSIDERED?

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:24.291 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO ASSUME

01:44:23.124 --> 01:44:25.659 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY

01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:26.994 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD CONCEDE WITH THE

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:28.996 region:rollup2
POINT RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS

01:44:26.994 --> 01:44:30.464 region:rollup2
THAT TO DATE. COVER CYCLES NEVER

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.832 region:rollup2
MISTREATED US.

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:33.334 region:rollup2
BUT HERE'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT THE

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:35.136 region:rollup2
SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM IS

01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:36.170 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED.

01:44:35.136 --> 01:44:37.538 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE WE HAD

01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:38.773 region:rollup2
A WASTE BOARD WE MIGHT HAVE

01:44:37.538 --> 01:44:39.974 region:rollup2
APPEALED TO HAD THERE BEEN A

01:44:38.773 --> 01:44:41.442 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:44:39.974 --> 01:44:42.376 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO.

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:43.811 region:rollup2
AND SO IF IT'S OUT OF AN

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:45.613 region:rollup2
ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION BUT BECAUSE

01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:46.180 region:rollup2
WE'RE CHARTING NEW TERRITORY

01:44:45.613 --> 01:44:48.082 region:rollup2
HERE WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:49.917 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. THAT MARKETS BE

01:44:48.082 --> 01:44:51.652 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED CAL RECYCLE STILL

01:44:49.917 --> 01:44:52.653 region:rollup2
RETAINS ALL DISCRETION IS DAMN

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:54.355 region:rollup2
MUCH WEIGHT THEY GIVE TO THESE

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:55.823 region:rollup2
CRITERIA WE SIMPLY WANT TO ADD

01:44:54.355 --> 01:44:57.057 region:rollup2
THIS TO THE LIST.

01:44:55.823 --> 01:44:58.793 region:rollup2

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:06.340 region:rollup2
REASON THAT THIS CAME ABOUT AS I

01:54:04.538 --> 01:54:08.909 region:rollup2
WAS DOING SOME. SOME VISITING IN

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:10.777 region:rollup2
AND OUR. LOCAL HAULERS AND AND

01:54:08.909 --> 01:54:11.712 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A CRISIS AND YOU KNOW

01:54:10.777 --> 01:54:13.046 region:rollup2

01:54:11.712 --> 01:54:14.514 region:rollup2
.

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:16.116 region:rollup2

DECIDED TO DO IT YOU KNOW ALL OF

01:54:17.918 --> 01:54:20.754 region:rollup2
A SUDDEN AND SO THERE WAS NO

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:21.855 region:rollup2

SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE UNDER

THROUGH THE ROUGH. AND I HAD A

02:44:42.372 --> 02:44:46.276 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION VERY RECENTLY WHERE

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:47.177 region:rollup2

WE BELIEVE THIS BILL HAS A FATAL

02:57:47.891 --> 02:57:53.163 region:rollup2
FLAW BECAUSE IT IS INSERTING A

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.131 region:rollup2
NEW PROJECT A CATEGORY LARGE

02:57:53.163 --> 02:57:57.133 region:rollup2

PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT OF CAPPING

02:58:02.839 --> 02:58:06.209 region:rollup2
THAT NEW INCLUSION AT NO MORE

THAN TEN PERCENT.

02:58:06.209 --> 02:58:10.079 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND WE

02:58:08.378 --> 02:58:12.248 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THIS CONCLUSION IS

02:58:10.079 --> 02:58:13.750 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

02:58:12.248 --> 02:58:15.552 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'SWHY AIR BE IS

02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:16.653 region:rollup2
LOOKING UNDER EVERY ROCK FOR

02:58:15.552 --> 02:58:17.954 region:rollup2

02:58:22.992 --> 02:58:26.029 region:rollup2
ISN'T ANY AYE COST CONTAINMENT.

02:58:24.561 --> 02:58:28.665 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE EXISTING.

02:58:26.029 --> 02:58:29.232 region:rollup2

ULTIMATELY MAKE THE DECISION THE

03:01:29.645 --> 03:01:33.850 region:rollup2
GOAL HERE.

03:01:32.148 --> 03:01:36.052 region:rollup2
I MEAN I WAS ON A LOCAL TRANSIT

03:01:33.850 --> 03:01:38.054 region:rollup2
BOARD IN ORANGE COUNTY. ARM.

03:01:36.052 --> 03:01:39.856 region:rollup2
THESE.

03:01:38.054 --> 03:01:41.791 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FUNDED.

03:01:39.856 --> 03:01:43.359 region:rollup2
BUS SYSTEMS DON'T HAVE AN

03:01:41.791 --> 03:01:45.962 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO

03:01:43.359 --> 03:01:48.364 region:rollup2
BUY EXPENSIVE NEW TECHNOLOGY.

03:01:45.962 --> 03:01:48.898 region:rollup2
THEY ALREADY SUBSIDIZE THE BUS

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:51.901 region:rollup2
FARES WE ALL SUBSIDIZE BUS

03:01:48.898 --> 03:01:54.637 region:rollup2
FARES.

03:01:51.901 --> 03:01:55.705 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT.

03:01:54.637 --> 03:01:57.206 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ROOM TO RAISE BUS

03:01:55.705 --> 03:01:57.640 region:rollup2
FARES.

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:59.709 region:rollup2
AND.

03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:01.177 region:rollup2
IN FACT RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING

03:01:59.709 --> 03:02:03.613 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OTHER.

03:02:01.177 --> 03:02:05.548 region:rollup2
SOCIETAL TRENDS BUT.

03:02:03.613 --> 03:02:07.350 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME IF THE STATE IS

03:02:05.548 --> 03:02:08.417 region:rollup2
GOING TO MANDATE EXPENSIVE NEW

03:02:07.350 --> 03:02:12.155 region:rollup2
VEHICLES

03:02:08.417 --> 03:02:13.689 region:rollup2
ST OUGHT TO HAVE A WAY. TO HELP.

03:02:12.155 --> 03:02:15.458 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

03:02:13.689 --> 03:02:18.094 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THOSE.

03:02:15.458 --> 03:02:20.129 region:rollup2
THOSE SO.

03:02:18.094 --> 03:02:21.864 region:rollup2
THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY.

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:23.132 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH

03:02:21.864 --> 03:02:25.835 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S APPROACH IN THE PAST

03:02:23.132 --> 03:02:27.537 region:rollup2
WE NEED WE MAY NEED MORE FUNDING

03:02:25.835 --> 03:02:29.639 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK TO.

03:02:27.537 --> 03:02:31.741 region:rollup2
TO MAKE LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES

03:02:29.639 --> 03:02:33.509 region:rollup2
IN ELIGIBLE. TO COMPETE.

03:02:31.741 --> 03:02:36.279 region:rollup2
.

03:02:33.509 --> 03:02:38.815 region:rollup2
IS A STEP SIDEWAYS OR BACKWARDS

03:02:36.279 --> 03:02:40.383 region:rollup2
SO ULTIMATELY A OR B. WILL BE

03:02:38.815 --> 03:02:41.451 region:rollup2
MAKING THIS DECISION WHETHER YOU

03:02:40.383 --> 03:02:42.952 region:rollup2

03:02:41.451 --> 03:02:44.353 region:rollup2

WOULDN'T. I WOULDN'T

03:02:44.353 --> 03:02:46.055 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY I THINK

03:02:44.987 --> 03:02:47.023 region:rollup2
IT'S

03:02:46.055 --> 03:02:49.258 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT PROGRESS IN ZERO

03:02:47.023 --> 03:02:51.127 region:rollup2

03:02:49.258 --> 03:02:52.195 region:rollup2

03:24:58.419 --> 03:25:01.589 region:rollup2

STATE'S BIO ENERGY RESOURCES

03:25:57.078 --> 03:26:01.850 region:rollup2
MUST BE AN ASPECT OF THAT

03:25:59.214 --> 03:26:03.251 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION.

03:26:01.850 --> 03:26:04.619 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE PHONE I KNOW THE

03:26:03.251 --> 03:26:05.920 region:rollup2
FOLKS HAVE RAISED ISSUES ABOUT

03:26:04.619 --> 03:26:09.858 region:rollup2
THE COST OF GEOTHERMALAND

03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:11.092 region:rollup2

03:26:09.858 --> 03:26:11.726 region:rollup2
BUT THE PENSKE IS A BUT THAT BUT

VALUE IN THESE RESOURCES ON A

03:26:11.726 --> 03:26:14.095 region:rollup2

03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:16.364 region:rollup2
THE HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL AND

03:26:14.095 --> 03:26:17.532 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC VALUES THESE RESOURCES

03:26:16.364 --> 03:26:19.901 region:rollup2
BRING TO THE STATE.

03:26:17.532 --> 03:26:21.669 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF

03:26:19.901 --> 03:26:23.805 region:rollup2
ONE CATASTROPHIC FILE IN MY

03:26:21.669 --> 03:26:25.073 region:rollup2

03:26:26.608 --> 03:26:30.278 region:rollup2
FAILING TO CONSIDER THESE

03:26:28.443 --> 03:26:31.746 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COST FOR REPAIRS AND

03:26:30.278 --> 03:26:35.650 region:rollup2
OUR STATE FAILS TO EVALUATE THE

03:26:31.746 --> 03:26:37.252 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE FROM A COMPREHENSIVE.

03:26:35.650 --> 03:26:39.120 region:rollup2
I ALSO KNOW FOLKS HAVE RAISED

03:26:37.252 --> 03:26:39.921 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT AIR QUALITY

03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:41.623 region:rollup2

FACILITIES.

03:26:41.623 --> 03:26:45.293 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE BIOMASS ENERGY IS

03:26:43.925 --> 03:26:47.595 region:rollup2
FAR BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR

03:26:45.293 --> 03:26:50.331 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AND OUR AIR QUALITY

03:26:47.595 --> 03:26:52.300 region:rollup2
THAT OPEN BURNING A RAPID FIRES.

03:26:50.331 --> 03:26:53.701 region:rollup2
BUT I AGREED THE STATE CAN DO

03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:55.837 region:rollup2
BETTER TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY

03:26:53.701 --> 03:26:57.572 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

03:26:55.837 --> 03:26:59.040 region:rollup2
HOLLYWOOD BIOMASS FACILITY IS

FINALLY IF THESE ISSUES ARE

03:27:14.956 --> 03:27:18.826 region:rollup2

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:28.429 region:rollup2
VERY POSITIVE THING.

SO LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

03:31:33.414 --> 03:31:35.850 region:rollup2
DESPITE THOSE CONCERNS YOU

TODAY.

03:31:37.184 --> 03:31:39.654 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ARGUMENT BASED ON THE

03:31:37.785 --> 03:31:42.557 region:rollup2

03:31:49.597 --> 03:31:52.767 region:rollup2
THIS OVER GROWTH LEADS TO TREE

03:31:51.032 --> 03:31:54.335 region:rollup2

IT WILL REQUIRE THINNING OUR

03:31:58.773 --> 03:32:02.276 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL LEFT FROM THINNING

IS BIOMASS.

03:32:02.276 --> 03:32:06.013 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THIS

JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT.

03:35:21.408 --> 03:35:24.879 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE OPPONENTS ARGUMENTS

03:35:23.344 --> 03:35:26.981 region:rollup2

03:35:24.879 --> 03:35:28.182 region:rollup2
ABOUT A DECADE AGO.

03:35:26.981 --> 03:35:29.750 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR

03:35:28.182 --> 03:35:31.452 region:rollup2

03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:33.587 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT HAVE SPENT THREE

03:45:04.958 --> 03:45:07.694 region:rollup2
BIOMASS REGIONS THE POTENTIAL

03:45:07.027 --> 03:45:09.930 region:rollup2
AIR QUALITY IMPACTS PARTICULARLY

03:45:07.694 --> 03:45:10.397 region:rollup2
IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS OR

03:45:09.930 --> 03:45:15.135 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:45:10.397 --> 03:45:16.269 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

03:45:15.135 --> 03:45:16.837 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE HERNANDEZ WE HAVE

03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:22.642 region:rollup2
TURNED IN OPPOSITION TO THE

03:45:16.837 --> 03:45:24.177 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:45:22.642 --> 03:45:25.312 region:rollup2
ANOTHER GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF

03:45:24.177 --> 03:45:29.216 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ALSO

03:45:25.312 --> 03:45:30.984 region:rollup2
IN OPPOSITION.

03:45:29.216 --> 03:45:33.220 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN

03:45:30.984 --> 03:45:37.391 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION SAYING NONE QUESTIONS

03:45:33.220 --> 03:45:45.332 region:rollup2
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

03:45:37.391 --> 03:45:47.567 region:rollup2
AS VARIOUS THEM AS EGGMAN.

03:45:45.332 --> 03:45:48.368 region:rollup2
I HAD I SHARED A NUMBER OF

03:45:47.567 --> 03:45:51.671 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS.

03:45:48.368 --> 03:45:53.673 region:rollup2
.

03:45:51.671 --> 03:45:55.308 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THOSE HAVE HAS TO DO

03:45:53.673 --> 03:45:57.377 region:rollup2
WITH ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

03:45:55.308 --> 03:45:59.579 region:rollup2
STANDARDS BEING BUILT INTO THE

03:45:57.377 --> 03:46:00.881 region:rollup2
PLAN. AYE KNOW THAT SOMETHING

03:45:59.579 --> 03:46:02.883 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING INTO

03:46:00.881 --> 03:46:06.686 region:rollup2
REMOVE.

03:46:02.883 --> 03:46:07.954 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN IS WHERE THE

03:46:06.686 --> 03:46:08.822 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WILL BE LOCATED IN

03:46:07.954 --> 03:46:11.258 region:rollup2
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE.

03:46:08.822 --> 03:46:13.126 region:rollup2
TRUCKS.

03:46:11.258 --> 03:46:15.595 region:rollup2
COMING IN TO WIN THAT WE HAVE TO

03:46:13.126 --> 03:46:16.563 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THE THE DIRTY AIR

03:46:15.595 --> 03:46:19.699 region:rollup2
BEING CAUSED BY THE DIESEL

03:46:16.563 --> 03:46:21.301 region:rollup2
TRUCKS.

03:46:19.699 --> 03:46:26.173 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:46:21.301 --> 03:46:28.041 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT AS A WHAT ARE AS WELL.

03:46:26.173 --> 03:46:33.246 region:rollup2
ALSO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BURN

03:46:28.041 --> 03:46:36.083 region:rollup2
DAYS.

03:46:33.246 --> 03:46:37.384 region:rollup2
CLOTHING SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT.

03:46:36.083 --> 03:46:43.790 region:rollup2
LIMITING THE BURN DAYS

03:46:37.384 --> 03:46:47.727 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY NEAR THE FACILITIES.

03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:50.363 region:rollup2
AND IN GENERAL ON BIOMASS.

03:46:47.727 --> 03:46:51.398 region:rollup2
IS THIS REALLY.

03:46:50.363 --> 03:46:54.067 region:rollup2
A SOURCE OF ENERGY WE WANT TO

03:46:51.398 --> 03:46:54.835 region:rollup2
INVEST IN.

03:46:54.067 --> 03:46:57.404 region:rollup2
CAN WE LIVE WITH IT ARE THE

03:46:54.835 --> 03:47:00.941 region:rollup2
CLEANER SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT

03:46:57.404 --> 03:47:03.376 region:rollup2
WE CAN INVEST IN.

03:47:00.941 --> 03:47:05.979 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

03:47:03.376 --> 03:47:06.947 region:rollup2
BUT I I FEEL THAT I FROM MY

03:47:05.979 --> 03:47:08.415 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS

03:47:06.947 --> 03:47:10.317 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:47:08.415 --> 03:47:12.018 region:rollup2
THE THE CONVERSATION WILL

03:47:10.317 --> 03:47:13.320 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

03:47:12.018 --> 03:47:16.022 region:rollup2
AND THE.

03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:17.691 region:rollup2
TO STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY THE

03:47:16.022 --> 03:47:18.558 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS

03:47:17.691 --> 03:47:20.927 region:rollup2
WILL BE.

03:47:18.558 --> 03:47:21.495 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE CONVERSATIONS

03:47:20.927 --> 03:47:24.464 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE DON'T CAUSE MORE

03:47:21.495 --> 03:47:26.233 region:rollup2
HARM.

03:47:24.464 --> 03:47:28.135 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE TRYING TO.

03:47:26.233 --> 03:47:29.803 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE PROBLEMS THROUGH YOUR

03:47:28.135 --> 03:47:32.672 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:47:29.803 --> 03:47:36.076 region:rollup2
I AM PREPARED TO TO.

03:47:32.672 --> 03:47:38.044 region:rollup2
AND VOTE. IN FAVOR TO ALLOW IT

03:47:36.076 --> 03:47:41.848 region:rollup2
TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE. BUT

03:47:38.044 --> 03:47:43.183 region:rollup2
RESERVE MY. RIGHT TO CHANGE THAT

03:47:41.848 --> 03:47:45.785 region:rollup2
VOTE WHEN IT COMES ON THE FLOOR.

03:47:43.183 --> 03:47:49.322 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE END RESULT

03:47:45.785 --> 03:47:51.725 region:rollup2
AND THE. POTENTIAL HARM AND THAT

03:47:49.322 --> 03:47:53.593 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN THE GOOD AND THE

03:47:51.725 --> 03:47:55.562 region:rollup2
BAD BECAUSE TO THE COMMUNITIES

03:47:53.593 --> 03:47:57.898 region:rollup2
AS A WHOLE.

03:47:55.562 --> 03:47:59.533 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

03:47:57.898 --> 03:48:00.066 region:rollup2
SO AUTUMN AND I APPRECIATE

03:47:59.533 --> 03:48:01.301 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HAD SOME GOOD

03:48:00.066 --> 03:48:02.702 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE BROUGHT TO

03:48:01.301 --> 03:48:04.538 region:rollup2
LIGHT A COUPLE THINGS THAT.

03:48:02.702 --> 03:48:06.606 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SHARE SO LET'S

03:48:04.538 --> 03:48:08.141 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THE INTENT OF THE BILL

03:48:06.606 --> 03:48:10.110 region:rollup2
IS TO ENSURE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR.

03:48:08.141 --> 03:48:11.912 region:rollup2
CLEAN WATER A BETTER CLIMATE FOR

03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:13.780 region:rollup2
ALL CAME. YOUR TRUCK A

03:48:11.912 --> 03:48:15.282 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:48:13.780 --> 03:48:17.951 region:rollup2
IF WE PUT WE NEED A BIOMASS

03:48:15.282 --> 03:48:19.052 region:rollup2
PLANTS WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE.

03:48:17.951 --> 03:48:21.154 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT

03:48:19.052 --> 03:48:22.556 region:rollup2
THEM IN AN AREA THAT THEY DO

03:48:21.154 --> 03:48:23.490 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TRUCK IT IN AND OUT.

03:48:22.556 --> 03:48:25.192 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE

03:48:23.490 --> 03:48:26.626 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE SO THE

03:48:25.192 --> 03:48:28.428 region:rollup2
INTENT THE INTENT IS THAT MAKE

03:48:26.626 --> 03:48:30.964 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE GET THE EXISTING

03:48:28.428 --> 03:48:32.566 region:rollup2
BIOMASS OF FACILITIES UPGRADED.

03:48:30.964 --> 03:48:33.433 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THOSE

03:48:32.566 --> 03:48:34.935 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF NEW

03:48:33.433 --> 03:48:36.202 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SENSE THAT EVER

03:48:34.935 --> 03:48:36.836 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

03:48:36.202 --> 03:48:38.071 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO

03:48:36.836 --> 03:48:39.005 region:rollup2
THIS

03:48:38.071 --> 03:48:40.740 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW

03:48:39.005 --> 03:48:41.308 region:rollup2
IF WITH THIS BILL DOESN'T GO

03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:43.143 region:rollup2
FORWARD I CAN'T REDUCE BURN

03:48:41.308 --> 03:48:45.445 region:rollup2
DAYS.

03:48:43.143 --> 03:48:47.180 region:rollup2
WE STILL HAVE ALL THAT WASTE

03:48:45.445 --> 03:48:48.048 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AG WASTE AND I SOME

03:48:47.180 --> 03:48:50.050 region:rollup2
OF YOU'VE BEEN TO MY.

03:48:48.048 --> 03:48:52.052 region:rollup2
DISTRICT BEFORE BUT IF SOMEONE

03:48:50.050 --> 03:48:53.587 region:rollup2
IS SAY TO ME YOU NEED TO BURN

03:48:52.052 --> 03:48:55.655 region:rollup2
THOSE STUMPS BECAUSE THE OTHER

03:48:53.587 --> 03:48:57.390 region:rollup2
STARTING TO ROT BECAUSE METHANE

03:48:55.655 --> 03:48:59.492 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS I. I WOULD SAYIS

03:48:57.390 --> 03:49:00.827 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU GIVE ME A WINDOW TIME

03:48:59.492 --> 03:49:02.529 region:rollup2
WITH THEY ARE BE FOR TWO HOURS

03:49:00.827 --> 03:49:05.065 region:rollup2
IS A BURN DAY YOU GET A PHONE

03:49:02.529 --> 03:49:05.432 region:rollup2
CALL IT'S A BURN DAY YOU RUN OUT

03:49:05.065 --> 03:49:06.600 region:rollup2
YOU START OF. A.

03:49:05.432 --> 03:49:08.602 region:rollup2
.

03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:10.637 region:rollup2
STUMP ON FIRE THEY DON'T BURN.

03:49:08.602 --> 03:49:13.139 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT QUICK THEY SMOLDER IN

03:49:10.637 --> 03:49:14.507 region:rollup2
SMOKERS IN THE AIR FOR HOURS AND

03:49:13.139 --> 03:49:16.343 region:rollup2
HOURS AND IT'S THE SAME WITH

03:49:14.507 --> 03:49:18.178 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY

03:49:16.343 --> 03:49:19.112 region:rollup2
OTHERS ABOUT ONE THAT WAY STE.

03:49:18.178 --> 03:49:20.847 region:rollup2
FROM THE HALLS WHEN THEY IN

03:49:19.112 --> 03:49:22.816 region:rollup2
PROCESSING THIS IS HARD HOLES

03:49:20.847 --> 03:49:23.750 region:rollup2
AFTER PROCESS OF WHAT DO YOU DO

03:49:22.816 --> 03:49:25.452 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:26.987 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET RID

03:49:25.452 --> 03:49:28.922 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE SAG WASTE

03:49:26.987 --> 03:49:30.090 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

03:49:28.922 --> 03:49:32.425 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD.

03:49:30.090 --> 03:49:33.827 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO

03:49:32.425 --> 03:49:35.729 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO AT LEAST LOOK AT

03:49:33.827 --> 03:49:37.897 region:rollup2
A HOLISTIC APPROACH RATHER THAN

03:49:35.729 --> 03:49:39.799 region:rollup2
JUST BEING JUST IT'S ALL ABOUT

03:49:37.897 --> 03:49:40.333 region:rollup2
KOSTER. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IS IT

03:49:39.799 --> 03:49:41.735 region:rollup2
GOING TO COST A LOT MORE

03:49:40.333 --> 03:49:43.803 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE

03:49:41.735 --> 03:49:45.438 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO BRING THAT COST DOWN

03:49:43.803 --> 03:49:46.706 region:rollup2
FOR THE REPAIRS AS WELL AS THE

03:49:45.438 --> 03:49:49.342 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS.

03:49:46.706 --> 03:49:50.210 region:rollup2
SO YES AND I COMMITTED TO LIKE

03:49:49.342 --> 03:49:51.878 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THEM OPENING

03:49:50.210 --> 03:49:54.414 region:rollup2
STATEMENT I'M NOT GOING TO BRING

03:49:51.878 --> 03:49:55.849 region:rollup2
THIS THIS TO THE FLOOR. UNLESS I

03:49:54.414 --> 03:49:57.217 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHERS WERE

03:49:55.849 --> 03:49:58.618 region:rollup2
GONNA COME UP ON THAT THAT YOU

03:49:57.217 --> 03:50:00.453 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WE DID OUR BEST TO

03:49:58.618 --> 03:50:00.887 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WAS GOOD CLEAN AIR FOR

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:02.889 region:rollup2
ALL.

03:50:00.887 --> 03:50:04.891 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:50:02.889 --> 03:50:07.127 region:rollup2
THE SEGMENT.

03:50:04.891 --> 03:50:08.695 region:rollup2
SO.

03:50:07.127 --> 03:50:11.998 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE TO THE

03:50:08.695 --> 03:50:13.600 region:rollup2
COST ISSUE FOR RATEPAYERS?

03:50:11.998 --> 03:50:16.102 region:rollup2
I'M I'M A DIVERSE.

03:50:13.600 --> 03:50:18.171 region:rollup2
ADORES DIVERSE PORTFOLIO.

03:50:16.102 --> 03:50:19.406 region:rollup2
MAKES JUST MORE SENSE.

03:50:18.171 --> 03:50:19.806 region:rollup2
ITS GONNA BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG

03:50:19.406 --> 03:50:22.609 region:rollup2
RUN.

03:50:19.806 --> 03:50:23.076 region:rollup2
I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF

03:50:22.609 --> 03:50:24.811 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DO THIS WITH

03:50:23.076 --> 03:50:25.812 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:50:24.811 --> 03:50:27.681 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BUYING

03:50:25.812 --> 03:50:29.482 region:rollup2
ENERGY ELSEWHERE.

03:50:27.681 --> 03:50:30.884 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE GOOD STRINGENT LAWS

03:50:29.482 --> 03:50:32.085 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THOSE

03:50:30.884 --> 03:50:33.853 region:rollup2
THE WHAT WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE

03:50:32.085 --> 03:50:35.255 region:rollup2
WITH BIOMASS.

03:50:33.853 --> 03:50:36.990 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NEED TO BE IMPROVED

03:50:35.255 --> 03:50:38.091 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY.

03:50:36.990 --> 03:50:40.560 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE RULES

03:50:38.091 --> 03:50:42.095 region:rollup2
MORE STRINGENT AND THAT'S WHAT.

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:43.963 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO.

03:50:42.095 --> 03:50:46.299 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER.

03:50:43.963 --> 03:50:48.435 region:rollup2
IT'S CHEAPER TO MAINTAIN.

03:50:46.299 --> 03:50:50.437 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE A BALLOTS.

03:50:48.435 --> 03:50:52.539 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF

03:50:50.437 --> 03:50:53.673 region:rollup2
THE FIRES TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS

03:50:52.539 --> 03:50:55.041 region:rollup2
AND WE IF WE CAN'T REMEMBER

03:50:53.673 --> 03:50:57.110 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF THIS THIS.

03:50:55.041 --> 03:50:58.611 region:rollup2
HOLD A.

03:50:57.110 --> 03:51:00.380 region:rollup2
FORMULA IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND

03:50:58.611 --> 03:51:02.248 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH MONEY WE COULD HAVE

03:51:00.380 --> 03:51:03.183 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING SOMETHING IN BENEFIT.

03:51:02.248 --> 03:51:04.751 region:rollup2
A ARE WE LOOKING AT OTHER

03:51:03.183 --> 03:51:06.019 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES ABSOLUTELY CAN WE

03:51:04.751 --> 03:51:07.354 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME OF THOSE BY THOSE

03:51:06.019 --> 03:51:08.388 region:rollup2
TREES THAT ARE FALLING DOWN ALL

03:51:07.354 --> 03:51:09.956 region:rollup2
OVER THE PLACE MAYBE NEW WOOD

03:51:08.388 --> 03:51:10.790 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

03:51:09.956 --> 03:51:13.626 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO

03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:15.261 region:rollup2
THINK REALLY HOLISTICALLY. AND.

03:51:13.626 --> 03:51:16.496 region:rollup2
I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL ALL

03:51:15.261 --> 03:51:17.964 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE I JUST

03:51:16.496 --> 03:51:18.832 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

03:51:17.964 --> 03:51:20.233 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S GONNA COST HUNDRED

03:51:18.832 --> 03:51:22.068 region:rollup2
INITIALLY.

03:51:20.233 --> 03:51:22.635 region:rollup2
BUT IT DID FOR EVERY OTHER EVERY

03:51:22.068 --> 03:51:24.704 region:rollup2
OTHER THE.

03:51:22.635 --> 03:51:26.940 region:rollup2
UTILITY WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST

03:51:24.704 --> 03:51:29.809 region:rollup2
OR BUTTRESSING SO.

03:51:26.940 --> 03:51:30.677 region:rollup2
YES I I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD.

03:51:29.809 --> 03:51:34.280 region:rollup2

03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:36.449 region:rollup2
AND I AND I BELIEVE IN I HAVE

03:51:35.315 --> 03:51:37.951 region:rollup2
BELIEVED FOR A LONG TIME I'VE

03:51:36.449 --> 03:51:39.419 region:rollup2
HAD BIOMASS PLANTS GO OUT OF.

03:51:37.951 --> 03:51:40.720 region:rollup2
OUT OF BUSINESS IN MY IN MY

03:51:39.419 --> 03:51:43.423 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THE WITH THE LOSS OF

03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:45.592 region:rollup2
JOBS AND THEN MORE OPEN BURNS ON

03:51:43.423 --> 03:51:47.460 region:rollup2
AG LANDS. TYPE I A BUT TO THE TO

03:51:45.592 --> 03:51:48.027 region:rollup2
THE FORCE AND I CERTAINLY HAVE

03:51:47.460 --> 03:51:49.529 region:rollup2
SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

03:51:48.027 --> 03:51:50.597 region:rollup2
TAKING OUT DEAD TREES. THAT

03:51:49.529 --> 03:51:52.832 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH I DID

03:51:50.597 --> 03:51:54.067 region:rollup2
A BILL LAST WEEK ABOUT HOW DO WE

03:51:52.832 --> 03:51:55.769 region:rollup2
CREATE. AND.

03:51:54.067 --> 03:51:56.669 region:rollup2

THEM THE WHOLE NEW AREA TO WORK

03:51:58.905 --> 03:52:01.374 region:rollup2
ON HIS TO DEVELOPING SOMETHING

03:52:00.407 --> 03:52:01.941 region:rollup2
WITH TIMBER PRODUCTS.

03:52:01.374 --> 03:52:03.409 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

03:52:01.941 --> 03:52:04.911 region:rollup2
CREATIVE AND WE CAN'T JUST LOOK

03:52:03.409 --> 03:52:07.080 region:rollup2
AT.

03:52:04.911 --> 03:52:08.648 region:rollup2
THE COST I THINK JUST OF THE

03:52:07.080 --> 03:52:10.350 region:rollup2
PROCUREMENT OF THAT ENERGY

03:52:08.648 --> 03:52:12.018 region:rollup2
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COST

03:52:10.350 --> 03:52:13.319 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING NOTHING

03:52:12.018 --> 03:52:14.487 region:rollup2
AND DOING THE SAME THING OVER

03:52:13.319 --> 03:52:16.656 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN.

03:52:14.487 --> 03:52:18.024 region:rollup2
AND ALSO WHEN WE SET POLICY IN

03:52:16.656 --> 03:52:19.692 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:52:18.024 --> 03:52:21.161 region:rollup2
WE FIND WAYS TO REDUCE COST WE

03:52:19.692 --> 03:52:22.762 region:rollup2
FIND WAYS TO BE ABLE TO BRING

03:52:21.161 --> 03:52:24.764 region:rollup2
THAT DOWN UNBALANCE THE GRID. I

03:52:22.762 --> 03:52:25.965 region:rollup2
TRUST WE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS I

03:52:24.764 --> 03:52:28.034 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD.

03:52:25.965 --> 03:52:29.402 region:rollup2
PROM AND I I THINK I THINK WE

03:52:28.034 --> 03:52:30.170 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO MORE. NOT LESS A MOVE

03:52:29.402 --> 03:52:32.472 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

03:52:30.170 --> 03:52:35.175 region:rollup2
THINKING.

03:52:32.472 --> 03:52:36.843 region:rollup2
MS LEE MOANED AND MR ACOSTA.

03:52:35.175 --> 03:52:38.678 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

03:52:36.843 --> 03:52:40.513 region:rollup2
RAISING THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW

03:52:38.678 --> 03:52:42.081 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

03:52:40.513 --> 03:52:43.082 region:rollup2
THIS ACTUALLY FOR SOME TIME.

03:52:42.081 --> 03:52:46.653 region:rollup2
AND.

03:52:43.082 --> 03:52:47.220 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IN BIOMASS

03:52:46.653 --> 03:52:48.822 region:rollup2
IS AN ISSUE THAT THE THING

03:52:47.220 --> 03:52:51.424 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED IT'S NOT THE

03:52:48.822 --> 03:52:52.258 region:rollup2
DIRECTION. THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE

03:52:51.424 --> 03:52:53.860 region:rollup2
ENERGY GO AND.

03:52:52.258 --> 03:52:55.595 region:rollup2
.

03:52:53.860 --> 03:52:56.930 region:rollup2
AND THEN A FACE THE FACT THAT

03:52:55.595 --> 03:52:59.532 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT HAS

03:52:56.930 --> 03:53:01.801 region:rollup2
BEEN DEALT. A VERY DIFFICULT

03:52:59.532 --> 03:53:02.402 region:rollup2
CARD NUMBER I BEING THE SITE OF

03:53:01.801 --> 03:53:03.736 region:rollup2
THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST

03:53:02.402 --> 03:53:03.903 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE.

03:53:03.736 --> 03:53:06.206 region:rollup2
AND.

03:53:03.903 --> 03:53:07.607 region:rollup2
.

03:53:06.206 --> 03:53:10.109 region:rollup2
I HAVE CONCERNS.

03:53:07.607 --> 03:53:11.177 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS YOU'VE ADDRESSED I

03:53:10.109 --> 03:53:14.447 region:rollup2
THINK SOME OF THE.

03:53:11.177 --> 03:53:16.249 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERNS RELATED TO TYING.

03:53:14.447 --> 03:53:18.485 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

03:53:16.249 --> 03:53:20.286 region:rollup2
TWO CLEANER AND BETTER

03:53:18.485 --> 03:53:22.522 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY HATE WHICH I THINK IS

03:53:20.286 --> 03:53:23.456 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE

03:53:22.522 --> 03:53:25.558 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT SOME FACILITIES.

03:53:23.456 --> 03:53:26.993 region:rollup2
.

03:53:25.558 --> 03:53:28.261 region:rollup2
ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS ARE

03:53:26.993 --> 03:53:29.128 region:rollup2
DIRTIER THAN OTHERS AND I THINK

03:53:28.261 --> 03:53:30.663 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:53:29.128 --> 03:53:32.165 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THAT THROUGHOUT THE

03:53:30.663 --> 03:53:34.767 region:rollup2
STATE AND PARTICULARLY WORRIED.

03:53:32.165 --> 03:53:35.768 region:rollup2
AS SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN IN

03:53:34.767 --> 03:53:37.704 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR MOST

03:53:35.768 --> 03:53:40.273 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES.

03:53:37.704 --> 03:53:42.609 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS.

03:53:40.273 --> 03:53:43.376 region:rollup2
THAT I I'D LOVE TO HAVE A

03:53:42.609 --> 03:53:46.212 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ONE WHO.

03:53:43.376 --> 03:53:48.348 region:rollup2
FROM ABOUT ONE IS RELATED TO

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:49.482 region:rollup2
THIS CCA'S THERE'S BEEN SOME

03:53:48.348 --> 03:53:52.018 region:rollup2
COMMENTS MADE THAT THIS.

03:53:49.482 --> 03:53:53.853 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT I SUPPORT SOME OF THE

03:53:52.018 --> 03:53:57.190 region:rollup2
WORK THAT CCA'S ARE DOING AND

03:53:53.853 --> 03:53:58.691 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE IS TO WHAT AND.

03:53:57.190 --> 03:54:00.526 region:rollup2
IS BEING KIND OF REFER TO AS THE

03:53:58.691 --> 03:54:02.695 region:rollup2
S. EXCLUSIVITY OF GEOTHERMAL

03:54:00.526 --> 03:54:04.597 region:rollup2
WHAT THE SALTON SEA AND SO I

03:54:02.695 --> 03:54:06.633 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN. COMMENT

03:54:04.597 --> 03:54:07.267 region:rollup2
ON. THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

03:54:06.633 --> 03:54:08.401 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON

03:54:07.267 --> 03:54:10.003 region:rollup2
THOSE.

03:54:08.401 --> 03:54:10.637 region:rollup2
SO SALTY REGION AS YOU'VE ALL

03:54:10.003 --> 03:54:12.505 region:rollup2

03:54:37.063 --> 03:54:42.035 region:rollup2
TOUGH FOR THE STATE.

03:54:39.699 --> 03:54:43.002 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE AS I

03:54:42.035 --> 03:54:44.170 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO EARLIER.

03:54:43.002 --> 03:54:46.072 region:rollup2
WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE

03:55:02.588 --> 03:55:05.391 region:rollup2
A SYSTEMIC.

03:55:03.222 --> 03:55:07.126 region:rollup2
.

03:55:05.391 --> 03:55:07.727 region:rollup2
BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

03:55:07.126 --> 03:55:09.796 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ISSUE IN THIS PART OF

03:55:07.727 --> 03:55:11.798 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

03:55:09.796 --> 03:55:13.800 region:rollup2
THE EXCLUSIVITY.

03:55:11.798 --> 03:55:15.501 region:rollup2
THAT IS REFERRED TO.

03:55:13.800 --> 03:55:16.336 region:rollup2
IS THE THE FACT THAT WE'RE

03:55:15.501 --> 03:55:18.171 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT A PERCENTAGE OF

03:55:16.336 --> 03:55:19.973 region:rollup2
GEOTHERMAL.

03:55:18.171 --> 03:55:22.609 region:rollup2

REGION. IS TO ADDRESS.

03:55:22.609 --> 03:55:25.845 region:rollup2
THE POINTS THAT I'VE JUST MADE.

03:55:24.377 --> 03:55:27.413 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN AREA THAT NEEDS THIS

03:55:25.845 --> 03:55:29.615 region:rollup2
TYPE OF INVESTMENT.

03:55:27.413 --> 03:55:31.651 region:rollup2
TO TURN AROUND BOTH THE.

03:55:29.615 --> 03:55:33.052 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

03:55:31.651 --> 03:55:34.187 region:rollup2
EXIST AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC

03:55:33.052 --> 03:55:35.121 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES

03:55:34.187 --> 03:55:36.856 region:rollup2

HA

03:55:36.856 --> 03:55:39.826 region:rollup2
IF.

03:55:37.557 --> 03:55:41.227 region:rollup2
WERE ALLOWED TO.

03:55:39.826 --> 03:55:42.328 region:rollup2
THE SALTON SEA REGION.

03:55:41.227 --> 03:55:44.397 region:rollup2
CAN

03:55:42.328 --> 03:55:45.465 region:rollup2
DEPLOY.

03:55:44.397 --> 03:55:46.566 region:rollup2
CLOSED ABOUT A THOUSAND.

03:55:45.465 --> 03:55:49.135 region:rollup2
.

03:55:46.566 --> 03:55:50.770 region:rollup2
MEGA WATTS.

03:55:49.135 --> 03:55:51.938 region:rollup2
OF JAIL DOOR MORE ENERGY.

03:55:50.770 --> 03:55:53.473 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE TRANSMISSION THAT

03:55:51.938 --> 03:55:55.441 region:rollup2
EXIST AND THAT'S.

03:55:53.473 --> 03:55:56.509 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE CALLASPO.

03:55:55.441 --> 03:55:57.644 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN

03:55:56.509 --> 03:55:59.979 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH THE REGIONAL

03:55:57.644 --> 03:56:00.546 region:rollup2
PARTNERS OUT THERE.

03:55:59.979 --> 03:56:02.682 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

03:56:00.546 --> 03:56:04.817 region:rollup2
THINGS WHERE. I AM.

03:56:02.682 --> 03:56:06.552 region:rollup2
YES IS IT IS AN EXCLUSIVITY IN

03:56:04.817 --> 03:56:08.554 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO IT EXTRA

03:56:06.552 --> 03:56:10.490 region:rollup2
ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THERE.

03:56:08.554 --> 03:56:11.891 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:13.593 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED BOTH ECONOMIC

03:56:11.891 --> 03:56:15.161 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ISSUES. AS WELL AS

03:56:13.593 --> 03:56:17.463 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES.

03:56:15.161 --> 03:56:18.431 region:rollup2
IN THE REGION.

03:56:17.463 --> 03:56:20.633 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

ALL OF YOU.

03:56:20.633 --> 03:56:25.271 region:rollup2
HAVE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION.

03:56:23.503 --> 03:56:27.340 region:rollup2
THAT ENSURES THAT THE.

03:56:25.271 --> 03:56:28.841 region:rollup2
STATE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH A

03:56:27.340 --> 03:56:30.943 region:rollup2
SOLVENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN. TO

03:56:28.841 --> 03:56:33.212 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL.

03:56:30.943 --> 03:56:35.248 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF.

03:56:33.212 --> 03:56:36.416 region:rollup2
S. C. DRYING UP IN.

03:56:35.248 --> 03:56:37.650 region:rollup2
EXACERBATING AIR QUALITY

03:56:36.416 --> 03:56:39.118 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE I

03:56:37.650 --> 03:56:40.753 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE

03:56:39.118 --> 03:56:41.688 region:rollup2
SEVEN OUT OF TEN CHILDREN OUT

03:56:40.753 --> 03:56:43.156 region:rollup2
THERE SUFFER FROM RESPIRATORY.

03:56:41.688 --> 03:56:45.358 region:rollup2
DISEASE PROBLEMS.

03:56:43.156 --> 03:56:45.925 region:rollup2
.

03:56:45.358 --> 03:56:46.793 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE TO REITERATE IT

03:56:45.925 --> 03:56:48.361 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:56:46.793 --> 03:56:50.663 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COUNTY THAT'S GOT

03:56:48.361 --> 03:56:52.565 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT

03:56:50.663 --> 03:56:53.733 region:rollup2
IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT.

03:56:52.565 --> 03:56:55.968 region:rollup2
IN A WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF

03:56:53.733 --> 03:56:58.371 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WAVE THE FLAG THAT

03:56:55.968 --> 03:57:00.740 region:rollup2

IN THE STATE.

03:57:06.079 --> 03:57:09.282 region:rollup2

PART OF THE STATE.

03:57:19.459 --> 03:57:22.628 region:rollup2

.

03:59:08.634 --> 03:59:10.336 region:rollup2
FIRST ITERATION OF THE

BOMB.

03:59:13.606 --> 03:59:16.809 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR COMMITTEE THAT DECIDED

03:59:14.874 --> 03:59:18.211 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THOSE.

03:59:16.809 --> 03:59:19.745 region:rollup2
BLANK IN THE INTERESTS OF

03:59:18.211 --> 03:59:20.379 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO EXPAND.

03:59:19.745 --> 03:59:22.215 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION TO BECOME A BIT

03:59:20.379 --> 03:59:23.449 region:rollup2
MORE.

03:59:22.215 --> 03:59:26.185 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE.

03:59:23.449 --> 03:59:28.955 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF THE.

03:59:26.185 --> 03:59:30.489 region:rollup2
RP S. POTENTIALLY INCREASING.

03:59:28.955 --> 03:59:31.591 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE I

03:59:30.489 --> 03:59:33.893 region:rollup2
RP.

03:59:31.591 --> 03:59:34.861 region:rollup2
.

03:59:33.893 --> 03:59:37.396 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF REGIONALIZATION

03:59:34.861 --> 03:59:39.732 region:rollup2
TAKING PLACE.

03:59:37.396 --> 03:59:40.333 region:rollup2
TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR LIKE IT.

.

03:59:43.002 --> 03:59:46.806 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY

03:59:45.037 --> 03:59:47.573 region:rollup2
TO REALLY.

03:59:46.806 --> 03:59:48.741 region:rollup2
BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE

03:59:47.573 --> 03:59:50.743 region:rollup2
TABLE.

PICKING OUT THOSE PERCENTAGES.

04:00:00.519 --> 04:00:05.258 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF BEING INTENTIONAL

04:00:03.055 --> 04:00:08.160 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO PROCURE GEOTHERMAL IN

04:00:05.258 --> 04:00:08.995 region:rollup2

OF MY GOAL PART OF THE REGION'S

04:00:08.995 --> 04:00:11.931 region:rollup2

PERCENTAGES OUT. IT REALLY

04:00:11.931 --> 04:00:14.400 region:rollup2

04:02:24.597 --> 04:02:27.400 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. AND I

04:02:26.532 --> 04:02:29.235 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S SOME SIGNIFICANT

04:02:27.400 --> 04:02:30.503 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I

04:02:29.235 --> 04:02:33.139 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE.

04:02:30.503 --> 04:02:36.642 region:rollup2
AS A SOCIETY FRANKLY BUT.

04:02:33.139 --> 04:02:39.278 region:rollup2
OUR THE EXCLUSIVITY SAUCY HAS ME

04:02:36.642 --> 04:02:40.946 region:rollup2
TROUBLE. THE. PERCENTAGE BEING

04:02:39.278 --> 04:02:42.114 region:rollup2
BEING GONE HAS ME TROUBLE NOT

04:02:40.946 --> 04:02:43.215 region:rollup2
BEING THERE AND I KNOW THAT

04:02:42.114 --> 04:02:44.683 region:rollup2
WASN'T YOUR CHOICE.

04:02:43.215 --> 04:02:46.185 region:rollup2
YOU THE AUTHOR'S CHOICE.

04:02:44.683 --> 04:02:47.887 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE.

04:02:46.185 --> 04:02:49.088 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE RATE PAYER ISSUES

04:02:47.887 --> 04:02:50.756 region:rollup2
IN AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS

04:02:49.088 --> 04:02:53.292 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHEN YOU BALANCE IT.

04:02:50.756 --> 04:02:55.027 region:rollup2
WITH THE FACT THAT ANYONE WHO

04:02:53.292 --> 04:02:56.829 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ON.

04:02:55.027 --> 04:02:58.964 region:rollup2
TIMBER TOURS OR BEEN.

04:02:56.829 --> 04:03:00.766 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE AG

04:02:58.964 --> 04:03:02.201 region:rollup2
SECTOR IT IS YOU WORK IN THE AG

04:03:00.766 --> 04:03:03.469 region:rollup2
SECTOR AND HAVING BEEN DOWN TALK

04:03:02.201 --> 04:03:05.371 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE ON ACT.

04:03:03.469 --> 04:03:06.705 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

04:03:05.371 --> 04:03:08.174 region:rollup2
THERE AND I I SAW WE ALL SAW

04:03:06.705 --> 04:03:09.608 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WILD FIRES

04:03:08.174 --> 04:03:11.644 region:rollup2
WE ALL SAW THE THE.

04:03:09.608 --> 04:03:13.813 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION THE

04:03:11.644 --> 04:03:15.714 region:rollup2
LOSS OF LIFE THE COST OF THE

04:03:13.813 --> 04:03:17.650 region:rollup2
SURE IT'S COST. ON AND ON AND ON

04:03:15.714 --> 04:03:19.552 region:rollup2
I WON'T BELABOR THAT BUT WE HAD

04:03:17.650 --> 04:03:21.086 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FIRES IN MY DISTRICT

04:03:19.552 --> 04:03:21.687 region:rollup2
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

04:03:21.086 --> 04:03:22.488 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS BILL

04:03:21.687 --> 04:03:23.622 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD REALLY HAVE

04:03:22.488 --> 04:03:25.324 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE

04:03:23.622 --> 04:03:27.259 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MOSTLY YOU KNOW THE

04:03:25.324 --> 04:03:28.494 region:rollup2
BRUSH TYPE BUYERS WILL HAVE THE.

04:03:27.259 --> 04:03:29.895 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE SELF SAME ISSUES

04:03:28.494 --> 04:03:31.263 region:rollup2
BUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM AN

04:03:29.895 --> 04:03:32.398 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT WE HAVE

04:03:31.263 --> 04:03:34.800 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE I THINK TO

04:03:32.398 --> 04:03:35.835 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME OF THIS MATERIAL OUT.

04:03:34.800 --> 04:03:37.336 region:rollup2
DO THE RIGHT THING WITH IT

04:03:35.835 --> 04:03:39.271 region:rollup2
PRODUCE SOMETHING IN OUR

04:03:37.336 --> 04:03:40.873 region:rollup2
BASELOAD ENERGY IN OUR BASE LOW

04:03:39.271 --> 04:03:42.308 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALLY DESPERATELY NEED.

04:03:40.873 --> 04:03:44.376 region:rollup2
AND AND SOME OF THE

04:03:42.308 --> 04:03:45.411 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING.

04:03:44.376 --> 04:03:47.313 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE COST OF BIOMASS

04:03:45.411 --> 04:03:48.647 region:rollup2
ETCETERA.

04:03:47.313 --> 04:03:50.649 region:rollup2
LOOK I I AGREE.

04:03:48.647 --> 04:03:52.318 region:rollup2
I THINK THE FREE MARKET SHOULD

04:03:50.649 --> 04:03:53.152 region:rollup2
DECIDE ALL OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW

04:03:52.318 --> 04:03:55.688 region:rollup2
BIG SURPRISE I KNOW YOU'RE ALL

04:03:53.152 --> 04:03:57.690 region:rollup2
SHOCK WERE WAY THAT SHIP SAILED.

04:03:55.688 --> 04:04:00.292 region:rollup2
AND WE SORT WEEKS WE.

04:03:57.690 --> 04:04:01.894 region:rollup2
SUBS.

04:04:00.292 --> 04:04:02.962 region:rollup2
SET UPON THEY MISSED THE

04:04:01.894 --> 04:04:04.163 region:rollup2
DIVESTMENT PUN OKAY.

04:04:02.962 --> 04:04:05.798 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT THAT SHIP SAILED AND

04:04:04.163 --> 04:04:07.933 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS

04:04:05.798 --> 04:04:09.735 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO SUBSIDIZE LOTS OF

04:04:07.933 --> 04:04:11.737 region:rollup2
THINGS INCLUDING SOLAR AND WIND

04:04:09.735 --> 04:04:13.839 region:rollup2
ENERGY? AND THEY DON'T WORK ALL

04:04:11.737 --> 04:04:15.674 region:rollup2
THE TIME AND WE ARE AS IS OUR

04:04:13.839 --> 04:04:16.809 region:rollup2
STATE GROSS FROM THIRTY EIGHT

04:04:15.674 --> 04:04:19.111 region:rollup2
MILLION TO FIFTY MILLION AS IS

04:04:16.809 --> 04:04:20.913 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO DO WE NEED TO HAVE

04:04:19.111 --> 04:04:22.481 region:rollup2
ALL THE RESOURCES WE POSSIBLY

04:04:20.913 --> 04:04:24.517 region:rollup2
CAN BRING TO BEAR. AND I THINK

04:04:22.481 --> 04:04:25.518 region:rollup2
THE BASELOAD ANSWER HERE THAT

04:04:24.517 --> 04:04:28.120 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS PROVIDING TO OUR

04:04:25.518 --> 04:04:28.521 region:rollup2
BASELOAD IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AT

04:04:28.120 --> 04:04:29.288 region:rollup2
THOSE TIMES ONLY.

04:04:28.521 --> 04:04:30.389 region:rollup2
.

04:04:29.288 --> 04:04:32.258 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE THAT THE ENERGY

04:04:30.389 --> 04:04:33.592 region:rollup2
THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED. I

04:04:32.258 --> 04:04:34.727 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A PART OF US THAT THE

04:04:33.592 --> 04:04:36.195 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS A PIECE OF THE

04:04:34.727 --> 04:04:38.430 region:rollup2
PUZZLE IS A LOT OF WORK FREE TO

04:04:36.195 --> 04:04:39.431 region:rollup2
BE DONE DOWN ON THIS. I'M NOT

04:04:38.430 --> 04:04:40.699 region:rollup2
TOTALLY THERE YET BUT LIKE MY

04:04:39.431 --> 04:04:41.800 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES I THINK WE NEED TO

04:04:40.699 --> 04:04:42.935 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

04:04:41.800 --> 04:04:45.204 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS IS THE

04:04:42.935 --> 04:04:46.872 region:rollup2
ONLY BILL. ADDRESSING ALL OF

04:04:45.204 --> 04:04:48.941 region:rollup2
THIS MATERIAL THIS YEAR SO LET'S

04:04:46.872 --> 04:04:51.243 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I'LL

04:04:48.941 --> 04:04:54.246 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT RELUCTANTLY TODAY.

04:04:51.243 --> 04:04:55.648 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WANT TO.

04:04:54.246 --> 04:04:56.882 region:rollup2
IT AS ALWAYS I THINK

04:04:55.648 --> 04:04:58.050 region:rollup2
KIND OF REDUNDANT TO SAY THAT WE

04:04:56.882 --> 04:04:59.985 region:rollup2
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OUR

04:04:58.050 --> 04:05:01.587 region:rollup2
OUR OUR VOTE ON THE FLOOR BUT.

04:04:59.985 --> 04:05:03.155 region:rollup2
I WOULD REALLY LIKE THAT THOUGH

04:05:01.587 --> 04:05:04.490 region:rollup2
THAT CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ON

04:05:03.155 --> 04:05:05.958 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULARLY WITH YOU KNOW

04:05:04.490 --> 04:05:07.059 region:rollup2
WITH UTILITY SECTOR WITH

04:05:05.958 --> 04:05:08.227 region:rollup2
CONSUMER GROUPS AND CONSUMER

04:05:07.059 --> 04:05:09.562 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES.

04:05:08.227 --> 04:05:10.429 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THIS MAKE SURE

04:05:09.562 --> 04:05:12.998 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE CLEANEST

04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:14.433 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SOLUTION IN THIS ROUND

04:05:12.998 --> 04:05:15.901 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET RID OF

04:05:14.433 --> 04:05:17.636 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL SOMEHOW SO. THANK

04:05:15.901 --> 04:05:19.772 region:rollup2
FOR BRING US FOR AND I WILL BE

04:05:17.636 --> 04:05:22.508 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU.

04:05:19.772 --> 04:05:24.910 region:rollup2
CHAU.

04:05:22.508 --> 04:05:25.411 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:26.679 region:rollup2
WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS

04:05:25.411 --> 04:05:28.047 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

04:05:26.679 --> 04:05:28.914 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST SIX

04:05:28.047 --> 04:05:31.350 region:rollup2
YEARS AND.

04:05:28.914 --> 04:05:33.118 region:rollup2
WERE.

04:05:31.350 --> 04:05:34.486 region:rollup2
WE'RE NO FURTHER WITH IT WHICH

04:05:33.118 --> 04:05:35.020 region:rollup2
IS FRUSTRATING DO I THINK

04:05:34.486 --> 04:05:37.990 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING TO ALL OF US

04:05:35.020 --> 04:05:39.892 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CONSISTENTLY. HAS

04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:40.960 region:rollup2
TURNED DOWN THESE MANDATED

04:05:39.892 --> 04:05:43.028 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS APPROACHES.

04:05:40.960 --> 04:05:43.829 region:rollup2
AND

04:05:43.028 --> 04:05:44.663 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING

04:05:43.829 --> 04:05:46.599 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE EVEN IF THIS BILL

04:05:44.663 --> 04:05:47.399 region:rollup2
MOVES.

04:05:46.599 --> 04:05:48.968 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING THOSE

04:05:47.399 --> 04:05:50.936 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS EVEN WITHOUT

04:05:48.968 --> 04:05:53.205 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A BELL SO YOU KNOW

04:05:50.936 --> 04:05:54.340 region:rollup2
THIS CAN FACILITATE THAT OR NOT

04:05:53.205 --> 04:05:55.608 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A BIGGER

04:05:54.340 --> 04:05:56.175 region:rollup2
PICTURE.

04:05:55.608 --> 04:05:57.243 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

04:05:56.175 --> 04:05:59.878 region:rollup2
CAUTIOUS.

04:05:57.243 --> 04:06:01.547 region:rollup2
AND.

04:05:59.878 --> 04:06:03.148 region:rollup2
IT I I HAVE BEEN DOWN SOLD CA

04:06:01.547 --> 04:06:04.583 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH AND I'VE

04:06:03.148 --> 04:06:05.117 region:rollup2
TRIED TO HELP SENATOR HUESO EVEN

04:06:04.583 --> 04:06:06.218 region:rollup2
BACK WHEN HE WAS ASSEMBLY

04:06:05.117 --> 04:06:07.253 region:rollup2
MEMBER.

04:06:06.218 --> 04:06:09.021 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE WITH WITH THE

04:06:07.253 --> 04:06:10.456 region:rollup2
SOLVENCY AND THEY'RE REALLY TWO

04:06:09.021 --> 04:06:12.091 region:rollup2
ISSUES GOING ON HERE.

04:06:10.456 --> 04:06:13.993 region:rollup2
THE BIOMASS ISSUE AND THEN THE

04:06:12.091 --> 04:06:15.761 region:rollup2
SALTON SEA.

04:06:13.993 --> 04:06:16.729 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THEN GEOTHERMAL ON TOP

04:06:15.761 --> 04:06:18.464 region:rollup2
OF THAT THEY THEY ARE DISTINCT

04:06:16.729 --> 04:06:19.865 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

04:06:18.464 --> 04:06:21.500 region:rollup2
AND EACH OF THEM ONE THINGS THAT

04:06:19.865 --> 04:06:22.735 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:06:21.500 --> 04:06:25.704 region:rollup2
THAT DOES DISTRESSED ME A LITTLE

04:06:22.735 --> 04:06:26.872 region:rollup2
BIT IS THIS IS A WAY OUT OF.

04:06:25.704 --> 04:06:28.140 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION THIS IS A WAY NOT

04:06:26.872 --> 04:06:30.242 region:rollup2
OUT OF TRANSMISSION.

04:06:28.140 --> 04:06:31.810 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL EVEN IF WE DO THAT

04:06:30.242 --> 04:06:32.978 region:rollup2
PUT THESE IN PLACE WE'RE TALKING

04:06:31.810 --> 04:06:35.080 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

04:06:32.978 --> 04:06:36.382 region:rollup2
TRANSITION IN TRANSMISSION LINES

04:06:35.080 --> 04:06:38.217 region:rollup2
WITH.

04:06:36.382 --> 04:06:39.518 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE LESS OUT OF STATE BUT

04:06:38.217 --> 04:06:40.619 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE REGIONALIZATION

04:06:39.518 --> 04:06:42.154 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHICH IS THEN

04:06:40.619 --> 04:06:44.089 region:rollup2
MOVING.

04:06:42.154 --> 04:06:45.157 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINES OUT OF STATE

04:06:44.089 --> 04:06:46.792 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BLEND IT

04:06:45.157 --> 04:06:48.394 region:rollup2
ALL TOGETHER SO I THINK WE HAVE

04:06:46.792 --> 04:06:49.928 region:rollup2
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE

04:06:48.394 --> 04:06:50.496 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FRAME THIS WHAT THE

04:06:49.928 --> 04:06:52.464 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ARE IN THE BENEFITS

04:06:50.496 --> 04:06:56.802 region:rollup2
ARE.

04:06:52.464 --> 04:06:59.638 region:rollup2
FINDING A WAY TO. PUT MONEY INTO

04:06:56.802 --> 04:07:01.907 region:rollup2
THE SOLVENCY AREA I'M WITH. AND

04:06:59.638 --> 04:07:03.309 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S ULTIMATELY COST

04:07:01.907 --> 04:07:05.044 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THROUGH THE RATES THAT

04:07:03.309 --> 04:07:06.145 region:rollup2
GIVES ME SOME SOME HEARTBURN

04:07:05.044 --> 04:07:07.613 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE ARE MORE

04:07:06.145 --> 04:07:10.215 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS ULTIMATELY

04:07:07.613 --> 04:07:11.917 region:rollup2
DOING THAT BECAUSE IF WE MANDATE

04:07:10.215 --> 04:07:13.152 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS WHICH HAS SPENT SOME

04:07:11.917 --> 04:07:16.055 region:rollup2
IN THIS LEGISLATURE AGAIN AND

04:07:13.152 --> 04:07:18.090 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AGAIN HAS SAID NO TO.

04:07:16.055 --> 04:07:19.558 region:rollup2
THEN WE ARE IN FACT PUTTING

04:07:18.090 --> 04:07:21.760 region:rollup2
BURDENS ON SOME OF THESE NAY

04:07:19.558 --> 04:07:23.529 region:rollup2
SAID CCA'S THAT ARE DEVELOPING.

04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:25.831 region:rollup2
AND MAKING THEM LESS COMPETITIVE

04:07:23.529 --> 04:07:27.166 region:rollup2
THAN THE THE OTHER MECHANISMS

04:07:25.831 --> 04:07:29.668 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT'S IT

04:07:27.166 --> 04:07:31.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S A CONCERN AND FINING

04:07:29.668 --> 04:07:32.905 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES WE SUBSIDIZE SOLAR YES

04:07:31.637 --> 04:07:34.406 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THAN WE HAVE DONE ALL

04:07:32.905 --> 04:07:37.009 region:rollup2
THAT. BUT NOT THROUGH THESE

04:07:34.406 --> 04:07:38.877 region:rollup2
MANDATED CONTRACTS.

04:07:37.009 --> 04:07:39.978 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH CAN HAVE LONGER TERM

04:07:38.877 --> 04:07:43.315 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS IN FOR US TO

04:07:39.978 --> 04:07:45.517 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE A PARTICULAR IDEA OR

04:07:43.315 --> 04:07:47.052 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY OR CONCEPT HAS BEEN

04:07:45.517 --> 04:07:47.886 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO LEGISLATURE FOR A

04:07:47.052 --> 04:07:49.421 region:rollup2
LONG TIME. THAT HAS DRIVEN

04:07:47.886 --> 04:07:51.190 region:rollup2
MARKETS

04:07:49.421 --> 04:07:52.391 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THAT THE SIZE

04:07:51.190 --> 04:07:54.626 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAS HAD SOME

04:07:52.391 --> 04:07:56.028 region:rollup2
VERY POSITIVE EFFECTS.

04:07:54.626 --> 04:07:57.896 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN MANDATING THIS A

04:07:56.028 --> 04:07:59.765 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS IS IS WHAT. I'M REALLY

04:07:57.896 --> 04:08:00.766 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH AND I DON'T KNOW

04:07:59.765 --> 04:08:03.001 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO

04:08:00.766 --> 04:08:04.103 region:rollup2
BE SUCCESSFUL SO IF THIS IS THE

04:08:03.001 --> 04:08:06.839 region:rollup2
ONLY MECHANISM TO HAVE A

04:08:04.103 --> 04:08:09.308 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. AND IT'S PROVEN BY

04:08:06.839 --> 04:08:10.342 region:rollup2
HISTORY NOT TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

04:08:09.308 --> 04:08:12.111 region:rollup2
I I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT WHERE

04:08:10.342 --> 04:08:14.813 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES US.

04:08:12.111 --> 04:08:16.115 region:rollup2
AND THEN EVEN ON THAT THE BIO.

04:08:14.813 --> 04:08:18.550 region:rollup2
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF

04:08:16.115 --> 04:08:20.619 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT BURNING THINGS AS

04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:22.087 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER EVEN THOUGH IT IS

04:08:20.619 --> 04:08:23.422 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN THE OPEN BURNING IN

04:08:22.087 --> 04:08:24.757 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE WAYS ABSOLUTELY

04:08:23.422 --> 04:08:26.058 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE IT. BUT WE'RE NOT

04:08:24.757 --> 04:08:28.160 region:rollup2
CAREFUL CAN BE PUTTING THOSE

04:08:26.058 --> 04:08:29.194 region:rollup2
FACILITIES. LOCATED IN EXACTLY

04:08:28.160 --> 04:08:30.162 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT TO

04:08:29.194 --> 04:08:32.097 region:rollup2
TRY TO PROTECT.

04:08:30.162 --> 04:08:33.899 region:rollup2
AND

04:08:32.097 --> 04:08:35.634 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WORKING AND BECAUSE

04:08:33.899 --> 04:08:37.569 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF ALL OF THE DEAD

04:08:35.634 --> 04:08:39.304 region:rollup2
TREES AND ALL THAT THE AREAS

04:08:37.569 --> 04:08:40.272 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA WHERE WE

04:08:39.304 --> 04:08:41.874 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT

04:08:40.272 --> 04:08:45.010 region:rollup2
WOULD. THAT MEANS HAVING MANY

04:08:41.874 --> 04:08:46.311 region:rollup2
MANY BIOMASS FACILITIES CITED.

04:08:45.010 --> 04:08:47.279 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO MEANS TRANSMISSION

04:08:46.311 --> 04:08:49.014 region:rollup2
LINES OR WERE TRACKING THAT

04:08:47.279 --> 04:08:49.615 region:rollup2
MATERIAL IN.

04:08:49.014 --> 04:08:51.884 region:rollup2
AND ITEM THAT WE'VE ACCOUNTED

04:08:49.615 --> 04:08:53.852 region:rollup2
FOR ALL.

04:08:51.884 --> 04:08:55.621 region:rollup2
IN IN THE QUESTION OR IN THE

04:08:53.852 --> 04:08:57.055 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONAL TIMIDLY THAT WERE

04:08:55.621 --> 04:08:58.757 region:rollup2
HAVING BECAUSE IT'S AN IN ALL

04:08:57.055 --> 04:08:59.358 region:rollup2
THIS AGAIN THIS IS KIND OF I

04:08:58.757 --> 04:09:00.993 region:rollup2
THINK YOUR POINT IS ITS ABOUT

04:08:59.358 --> 04:09:02.828 region:rollup2
TRADEOFFS.

04:09:00.993 --> 04:09:03.328 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT.

04:09:02.828 --> 04:09:09.802 region:rollup2
WHAT I CONTINUE A LITTLE

04:09:03.328 --> 04:09:11.670 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:09:09.802 --> 04:09:12.938 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF A BY A MASS IN

04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:14.640 region:rollup2
THE BURNING AT THAT LEVEL BUT I

04:09:12.938 --> 04:09:16.208 region:rollup2
AM INTERESTED IN THEIR COUNTRIES

04:09:14.640 --> 04:09:17.342 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE? SINCE GETTING EVEN

04:09:16.208 --> 04:09:18.844 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THIRTY PLUS

04:09:17.342 --> 04:09:20.078 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THEIR ELECTRICITY

04:09:18.844 --> 04:09:21.980 region:rollup2
THAT IS PROVIDED BY MAP BY

04:09:20.078 --> 04:09:23.048 region:rollup2
BIOMASS AND THEY IMPORT BIOMASS

04:09:21.980 --> 04:09:24.983 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO DRIVE THAT

04:09:23.048 --> 04:09:26.452 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

04:09:24.983 --> 04:09:28.687 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SOME VERY.

04:09:26.452 --> 04:09:30.088 region:rollup2
ECOLOGICALLY CLEAN COUNTRIES

04:09:28.687 --> 04:09:31.423 region:rollup2
WITH WITH GOOD GOOD AIR QUALITY

04:09:30.088 --> 04:09:33.325 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME SOME

04:09:31.423 --> 04:09:35.060 region:rollup2
MODELS OUT THERE. BUT IF IT'S

04:09:33.325 --> 04:09:36.929 region:rollup2
ABOUT RESTORING THE FACILITIES

04:09:35.060 --> 04:09:38.463 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN OR ADDING

04:09:36.929 --> 04:09:40.265 region:rollup2
NEW FACILITIES WE'RE NOW ADDING

04:09:38.463 --> 04:09:41.800 region:rollup2
A LOT OF COMPLEXITY WE'RE ADDING

04:09:40.265 --> 04:09:43.502 region:rollup2
NEW AIR QUALITY QUESTIONS TO IT.

04:09:41.800 --> 04:09:45.971 region:rollup2
AND READING TRANSMISSION LINES

04:09:43.502 --> 04:09:47.239 region:rollup2
NOW. ALL OVER THE PLACE IF IN IF

04:09:45.971 --> 04:09:48.373 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT THAT THROUGH

04:09:47.239 --> 04:09:49.975 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE GO WITH

04:09:48.373 --> 04:09:51.143 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:09:49.975 --> 04:09:53.245 region:rollup2
SO LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL

04:09:51.143 --> 04:09:54.479 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE.

04:09:53.245 --> 04:09:55.981 region:rollup2
PUSH A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THIS

04:09:54.479 --> 04:09:57.316 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THEM NOT

04:09:55.981 --> 04:09:58.050 region:rollup2
QUITE SURE WHAT THAT THE CHAIR

04:09:57.316 --> 04:10:00.018 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO DO.

04:09:58.050 --> 04:10:01.453 region:rollup2
PROBABLY INCLINED TO TO FOLLOW

04:10:00.018 --> 04:10:02.721 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR AND HELP OUT BECAUSE

04:10:01.453 --> 04:10:03.355 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE

04:10:02.721 --> 04:10:05.190 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THAT'S BEEN HAVING

04:10:03.355 --> 04:10:05.791 region:rollup2
THAT CONVERSATION BUT ALL THE

04:10:05.190 --> 04:10:07.693 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS OUT THERE WHO WANT

04:10:05.791 --> 04:10:10.362 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:10:07.693 --> 04:10:12.130 region:rollup2
TO TO PASS THROUGH.

04:10:10.362 --> 04:10:14.166 region:rollup2
THIS HASN'T BEEN THE ANSWER.

04:10:12.130 --> 04:10:15.567 region:rollup2
THIS PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE THE

04:10:14.166 --> 04:10:17.135 region:rollup2
ANSWER THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S A

04:10:15.567 --> 04:10:18.871 region:rollup2
MY GUESS IS GONNA DIE AGAIN LIKE

04:10:17.135 --> 04:10:19.471 region:rollup2
IT'S DIED BEFORE EVERY SINGLE

04:10:18.871 --> 04:10:20.472 region:rollup2
TIME SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE

04:10:19.471 --> 04:10:22.040 region:rollup2
US.

04:10:20.472 --> 04:10:24.009 region:rollup2
WHY AREN'T WE WHAT'S THE REAL

04:10:22.040 --> 04:10:25.310 region:rollup2
ANSWER?

04:10:24.009 --> 04:10:26.845 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE PROVE AND AND THERE

04:10:25.310 --> 04:10:27.913 region:rollup2
ARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE LOOKING AT

04:10:26.845 --> 04:10:29.147 region:rollup2
THIS THE PC AND OTHERS TO TRY

04:10:27.913 --> 04:10:30.916 region:rollup2
AND AND PEACE ALL THESE THINGS

04:10:29.147 --> 04:10:32.818 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND THEN THIS YEAR ON

04:10:30.916 --> 04:10:34.520 region:rollup2
TOP OF ALL OF THIS?

04:10:32.818 --> 04:10:36.822 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME THAT THE

04:10:34.520 --> 04:10:37.656 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ARE LOOKING FOR.

04:10:36.822 --> 04:10:39.358 region:rollup2
A CHANGE IN HOW LIABILITIES

04:10:37.656 --> 04:10:41.727 region:rollup2
CALCULATED.

04:10:39.358 --> 04:10:42.761 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT WORKS.

04:10:41.727 --> 04:10:44.463 region:rollup2
THEN GUESS WHO'S GOING TO BE

04:10:42.761 --> 04:10:46.431 region:rollup2
PICKING UP THAT LIABILITY WHICH

04:10:44.463 --> 04:10:48.100 region:rollup2
MEANS THERE NOW IT'S THE RATE

04:10:46.431 --> 04:10:48.700 region:rollup2
PAYERS IT'S THE HOMEOWNERS.

04:10:48.100 --> 04:10:49.868 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOW PAYING A WHOLE LOT

04:10:48.700 --> 04:10:51.537 region:rollup2
MORE

04:10:49.868 --> 04:10:54.373 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE. WHICH WOULD ADDING

04:10:51.537 --> 04:10:56.308 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON TOP OF BURDEN IN. IN A

04:10:54.373 --> 04:10:57.643 region:rollup2
WAY IN SITUATION NOW BECAUSE OF

04:10:56.308 --> 04:10:59.378 region:rollup2
THE FIRES OF HIS SITUATION WE.

04:10:57.643 --> 04:11:03.081 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S REALLY UNCERTAIN.

04:10:59.378 --> 04:11:04.683 region:rollup2
SO I.

04:11:03.081 --> 04:11:06.318 region:rollup2
I FEEL YOUR PAIN I UNDERSTAND

04:11:04.683 --> 04:11:07.986 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THERE'S A

04:11:06.318 --> 04:11:10.389 region:rollup2
LOT OF IT THAT I LIKE THAT HAVE

04:11:07.986 --> 04:11:12.157 region:rollup2
REALLY PUSHED AND STRETCH.

04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:12.791 region:rollup2
TO TRY AND HELP BEFORE BUT IT

04:11:12.157 --> 04:11:14.526 region:rollup2
JUST SEEMS AND THIS IS NOT YOUR

04:11:12.791 --> 04:11:15.460 region:rollup2
FAULT.

04:11:14.526 --> 04:11:16.628 region:rollup2
THIS JUST YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:18.096 region:rollup2
YEAR WE'RE JUST IN THE SAME

04:11:16.628 --> 04:11:19.665 region:rollup2
PLACE.

04:11:18.096 --> 04:11:20.799 region:rollup2
AND SPINNING OUR WHEELS SO I

04:11:19.665 --> 04:11:21.366 region:rollup2
HOPE WE GET A LITTLE MORE

04:11:20.799 --> 04:11:22.968 region:rollup2
CREATIVE FIND SOME SOME WAY

04:11:21.366 --> 04:11:25.771 region:rollup2
ELSE.

04:11:22.968 --> 04:11:27.806 region:rollup2
TO TRULY INCENTIVIZE

04:11:25.771 --> 04:11:30.375 region:rollup2
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE IF

04:11:27.806 --> 04:11:32.311 region:rollup2
THERE. IF IT'S WORTH IT A LITTLE

04:11:30.375 --> 04:11:34.179 region:rollup2
BIT A SUBSIDY MIGHT END UP

04:11:32.311 --> 04:11:36.715 region:rollup2
CREATING A MARKET.

04:11:34.179 --> 04:11:38.617 region:rollup2
BUT LONG TERM CONTRACTS IF THE

04:11:36.715 --> 04:11:40.986 region:rollup2
IF WE END UP SUPPORTING THEM AND

04:11:38.617 --> 04:11:41.954 region:rollup2
NOT DRIVING TECHNOLOGY AND NOT

04:11:40.986 --> 04:11:43.755 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT MARKET NOT

04:11:41.954 --> 04:11:44.690 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT INNOVATION THAT

04:11:43.755 --> 04:11:46.325 region:rollup2
THEN ULTIMATELY DRIVES COSTS

04:11:44.690 --> 04:11:48.460 region:rollup2
DOWN. AND WE JUST END UP IN A

04:11:46.325 --> 04:11:50.495 region:rollup2
POSITION OF OF. OF SUBSIDIZING

04:11:48.460 --> 04:11:52.097 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE RATES.

04:11:50.495 --> 04:11:54.132 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING

04:11:52.097 --> 04:11:54.1000 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE ANYWAY THAT I DON'T

04:11:54.132 --> 04:11:56.368 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE DONE OURSELVES A

04:11:54.1000 --> 04:11:59.471 region:rollup2
GREAT SERVICE.

04:11:56.368 --> 04:12:00.706 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S.

04:11:59.471 --> 04:12:01.940 region:rollup2
RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT

04:12:00.706 --> 04:12:03.642 region:rollup2
LEAVES US RIGHT I THINK I THINK

04:12:01.940 --> 04:12:04.576 region:rollup2
IT NEEDS IS A PLACE WHERE I

04:12:03.642 --> 04:12:05.877 region:rollup2
THINK YOU NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN

04:12:04.576 --> 04:12:07.713 region:rollup2
THIS CONVERSATION.

04:12:05.877 --> 04:12:09.348 region:rollup2
I CAN APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS

04:12:07.713 --> 04:12:10.983 region:rollup2
AND COMMENTS FROM EVERYONE. THUS

04:12:09.348 --> 04:12:13.518 region:rollup2
FAR BUT YOURS IN PARTICULAR HAVE

04:12:10.983 --> 04:12:14.886 region:rollup2
BEEN EXTREMELY. HELPFUL RIGHT IN

04:12:13.518 --> 04:12:15.420 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE

04:12:14.886 --> 04:12:17.356 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO

04:12:15.420 --> 04:12:19.958 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

04:12:17.356 --> 04:12:20.959 region:rollup2
AND VOTING NO. RIGHT IS REALLY

04:12:19.958 --> 04:12:22.394 region:rollup2
NOT THAT GOING TO GET US

04:12:20.959 --> 04:12:24.162 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE DIFFERENT THAN AS YOU

04:12:22.394 --> 04:12:26.665 region:rollup2
JUST SAID. THEY WERE WE'VE BEEN

04:12:24.162 --> 04:12:27.299 region:rollup2
BEFORE. AND SO THE FACT IS I

04:12:26.665 --> 04:12:28.233 region:rollup2
THINK COMMITTEES ALL THE TIME

04:12:27.299 --> 04:12:29.568 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE SAY I WOULD VOTE NO

04:12:28.233 --> 04:12:30.702 region:rollup2
ON YOUR BILL BUT I WANT TO BE IN

04:12:29.568 --> 04:12:31.703 region:rollup2
YOUR IN THE CONVERSATION. WHAT

04:12:30.702 --> 04:12:33.405 region:rollup2
LIGHT AND THAT AND YOU'RE

04:12:31.703 --> 04:12:34.239 region:rollup2
WELCOME TO WRITE NAY WE I THINK

04:12:33.405 --> 04:12:35.941 region:rollup2
THAT YOU BRING A TREMENDOUS

04:12:34.239 --> 04:12:36.742 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OF VALUE TO THE

04:12:35.941 --> 04:12:38.176 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION?

04:12:36.742 --> 04:12:40.045 region:rollup2
FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS

04:12:38.176 --> 04:12:41.613 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY ARE. THE ISSUES

04:12:40.045 --> 04:12:42.581 region:rollup2
THAT YOU RAISE AS IT RELATES TO

04:12:41.613 --> 04:12:44.316 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

04:12:42.581 --> 04:12:45.283 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ALL OF THE ISSUES

04:12:44.316 --> 04:12:46.585 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

04:12:45.283 --> 04:12:47.653 region:rollup2
AS THEY'VE BEEN RAISED UP BY

04:12:46.585 --> 04:12:49.821 region:rollup2
SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE

04:12:47.653 --> 04:12:52.391 region:rollup2
INCLUDING FOLKS IN OUR DISTRICT.

04:12:49.821 --> 04:12:54.126 region:rollup2
DOT IDEA AND I KNOW HOW

04:12:52.391 --> 04:12:55.560 region:rollup2
CONCERNED YOU ARE ABOUT

I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND THAT

04:12:57.195 --> 04:12:59.297 region:rollup2
BRINGS. THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

04:12:57.796 --> 04:13:01.600 region:rollup2
DONE BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY

04:12:59.297 --> 04:13:03.502 region:rollup2
TO THIS TO AUTHORIZATION AND SO.

04:13:01.600 --> 04:13:04.770 region:rollup2
WERE ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES.

04:13:03.502 --> 04:13:06.571 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T PICKED A WHOLE LOT OF

04:13:04.770 --> 04:13:08.206 region:rollup2
EASY ISSUES OF THE THREE YEARS

04:13:06.571 --> 04:13:10.108 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TO WORK ON.

04:13:08.206 --> 04:13:11.676 region:rollup2
AND DON'T INTEND TO CHANGE THAT.

04:13:10.108 --> 04:13:12.911 region:rollup2
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

04:13:11.676 --> 04:13:14.780 region:rollup2
THESE ARE PRESSING MATTERS IN MY

04:13:12.911 --> 04:13:16.448 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. AND THEY TIE INTO THE

04:13:14.780 --> 04:13:17.916 region:rollup2
OVERALL STATE.

04:13:16.448 --> 04:13:18.717 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE

04:13:17.916 --> 04:13:20.652 region:rollup2
AND SO.

04:13:18.717 --> 04:13:21.286 region:rollup2
AYE MULLIN.

04:13:20.652 --> 04:13:22.187 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO ROLLING UP OUR

04:13:21.286 --> 04:13:24.156 region:rollup2
SLEEVES.

04:13:22.187 --> 04:13:25.657 region:rollup2
A.

04:13:24.156 --> 04:13:26.725 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THESE HARD ISSUES

04:13:25.657 --> 04:13:28.093 region:rollup2
AND IF WE CAN'T GET TO A PLACE

04:13:26.725 --> 04:13:29.394 region:rollup2
WHERE FOLKS FEEL COMFORTABLE

04:13:28.093 --> 04:13:30.429 region:rollup2
THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF

04:13:29.394 --> 04:13:32.464 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SAID THAT I WILL

04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:34.032 region:rollup2
RESERVE MY RIGHT. TO VOTE ON THE

04:13:32.464 --> 04:13:34.633 region:rollup2
BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR

04:13:34.032 --> 04:13:36.101 region:rollup2
IF IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. AND

04:13:34.633 --> 04:13:36.668 region:rollup2
IT.

04:13:36.101 --> 04:13:38.437 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DIE.

04:13:36.668 --> 04:13:39.771 region:rollup2
.

04:13:38.437 --> 04:13:41.273 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:13:39.771 --> 04:13:42.841 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVITY TO THE SALTON SEA

04:13:41.273 --> 04:13:44.042 region:rollup2
HAS COME UP.

04:13:42.841 --> 04:13:45.711 region:rollup2
YOU TELL ME ANOTHER PLACE ON

04:13:44.042 --> 04:13:46.178 region:rollup2
THIS CONTINENT.

04:13:45.711 --> 04:13:49.181 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THE AMOUNT OF

04:13:46.178 --> 04:13:50.515 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

04:13:49.181 --> 04:13:51.216 region:rollup2
LIKE THE SONGS THE AREA DOES AS

04:13:50.515 --> 04:13:53.185 region:rollup2
A RELEASE A GEOTHERMAL.

04:13:51.216 --> 04:13:55.954 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T.

04:13:53.185 --> 04:13:57.656 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS. OF

04:13:55.954 --> 04:13:59.991 region:rollup2
THE INTENTION HERE.

04:13:57.656 --> 04:14:01.226 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT WE PROCURE SOME

04:13:59.991 --> 04:14:02.427 region:rollup2
ENERGY FROM THAT REGION TO HELP

04:14:01.226 --> 04:14:03.762 region:rollup2
US ADDRESS BOTH THE

04:14:02.427 --> 04:14:06.031 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

04:14:03.762 --> 04:14:08.133 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THAT.

04:14:06.031 --> 04:14:10.168 region:rollup2
THIS PART OF THE STATE SO.

04:14:08.133 --> 04:14:11.837 region:rollup2
I'D MISTER STONE AYE I WELCOME

04:14:10.168 --> 04:14:14.106 region:rollup2
YOUR PARTICIPATION.

04:14:11.837 --> 04:14:15.273 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY AND I WOULD IMAGINE

04:14:14.106 --> 04:14:16.942 region:rollup2
THAT MY COLLEAGUE THAT AS WELL.

04:14:15.273 --> 04:14:20.011 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN GET THINGS DONE

04:14:16.942 --> 04:14:21.747 region:rollup2
YEAH I AND. NOT JUST YOU BUT TO

04:14:20.011 --> 04:14:23.248 region:rollup2

04:14:21.747 --> 04:14:24.983 region:rollup2
IF THIS THING MOVES DIE

04:14:23.248 --> 04:14:25.751 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.

04:14:24.983 --> 04:14:27.586 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BACK HAVE THE

04:14:25.751 --> 04:14:28.754 region:rollup2
SAME CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR

04:14:27.586 --> 04:14:30.088 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAD AT LAST YEAR WE

04:14:28.754 --> 04:14:31.289 region:rollup2
HAD A YEAR BEFORE WE'VE HAD IT

04:14:30.088 --> 04:14:33.325 region:rollup2
EVERY NUMBER OF YEARS.

04:14:31.289 --> 04:14:34.493 region:rollup2
SO NOTHING'S MOVING.

04:14:33.325 --> 04:14:36.928 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MOVE

04:14:34.493 --> 04:14:38.530 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

04:14:36.928 --> 04:14:39.865 region:rollup2

THROUGH AND IT AND IT NOT WORK.

04:14:43.602 --> 04:14:47.105 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO SOLVE

04:14:45.137 --> 04:14:49.174 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS IN THE SALTON SEA

04:14:47.105 --> 04:14:50.876 region:rollup2

04:14:50.876 --> 04:14:55.380 region:rollup2
FACETED TO ADDRESSTHE LARGEST

04:14:53.779 --> 04:14:56.381 region:rollup2
AG WASTES BUT THE FORCE FIRE

04:14:55.380 --> 04:14:58.416 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND THAT. AND.

04:14:56.381 --> 04:14:59.050 region:rollup2
.

04:14:58.416 --> 04:15:00.986 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE FORCE OF GROWN IN

04:14:59.050 --> 04:15:02.587 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF THAT WE NEED TO BE

04:15:00.986 --> 04:15:04.156 region:rollup2
CLEARED OUT BECAUSE I'M NOT.

04:15:02.587 --> 04:15:06.024 region:rollup2

BIOMASS PLANTS AROUND.

04:15:07.926 --> 04:15:10.362 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE

04:15:08.927 --> 04:15:12.697 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IT'S A MUCH BIGGER

04:15:10.362 --> 04:15:14.933 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAN ABOUT.

04:15:12.697 --> 04:15:17.402 region:rollup2
WITHOUT NECESSARILY SOMETHING IN

04:15:14.933 --> 04:15:19.070 region:rollup2

THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE WAY

04:15:37.789 --> 04:15:40.325 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE NEED OTHER INVESTMENTS

04:15:39.090 --> 04:15:42.561 region:rollup2

THIS BILL WAS AN IDEA THAT I

04:31:43.487 --> 04:31:47.024 region:rollup2
BETTER KNOWN AS THE BOTTLE BILL

04:31:45.022 --> 04:31:48.325 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS A SELF FUNDED PROGRAM

04:31:47.024 --> 04:31:50.561 region:rollup2
THAT ENCOURAGES CONSUMERS TO

04:31:48.325 --> 04:31:52.296 region:rollup2
RECYCLE. BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO

04:31:50.561 --> 04:31:53.631 region:rollup2
PREVENT LETTERING.

04:31:52.296 --> 04:31:54.899 region:rollup2
OVER THE THREE DECADES OF ITS

04:31:53.631 --> 04:31:57.001 region:rollup2
OPERATION THE BOTTOM BILL

04:31:54.899 --> 04:31:58.435 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS DIVERTED MANY MANY

04:31:57.001 --> 04:32:00.404 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

04:31:58.435 --> 04:32:01.839 region:rollup2
FROM LANDFILLS AND FOR MOST OF

04:32:00.404 --> 04:32:03.741 region:rollup2
THIS TIME IT'S BEEN SEEN AS A

04:32:01.839 --> 04:32:05.409 region:rollup2
MODEL RECYCLING PROGRAM. HOWEVER

04:32:03.741 --> 04:32:07.011 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT

04:32:05.409 --> 04:32:08.813 region:rollup2
REPUTATION HAS TAKEN A BIT OF A

04:32:07.011 --> 04:32:10.514 region:rollup2
BEATING AGAIN THE. PROGRAM HAS

04:32:08.813 --> 04:32:11.882 region:rollup2
BEEN TRENDING IN THE WRONG

04:32:10.514 --> 04:32:13.417 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

04:32:11.882 --> 04:32:15.419 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN APPROXIMATELY

04:32:13.417 --> 04:32:16.654 region:rollup2
ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL IN STATE

RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE

04:32:16.654 --> 04:32:20.124 region:rollup2
SHUDDERED ITS OPERATIONS. USE OF

04:32:18.589 --> 04:32:21.559 region:rollup2
THE VERY PLACES WHERE CONSUMERS

04:32:20.124 --> 04:32:22.626 region:rollup2
RETURNED THEIR CONTAINERS OR

04:32:21.559 --> 04:32:23.994 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN THEIR

04:32:22.626 --> 04:32:25.663 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS TO GET THEIR MONEY

04:32:23.994 --> 04:32:27.531 region:rollup2
BACK.

04:32:25.663 --> 04:32:28.599 region:rollup2
THIS MASS INFRASTRUCTURE LOSS IS

04:32:27.531 --> 04:32:29.800 region:rollup2
A DIRECT RESULT OF THE

04:32:28.599 --> 04:32:31.869 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF

04:32:29.800 --> 04:32:34.104 region:rollup2

THE REDUCTION IN STATE PAYMENTS

04:32:36.207 --> 04:32:39.610 region:rollup2
TO THE RECYCLERS LOCATED AND ARE

04:32:37.908 --> 04:32:40.911 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE OUNCE.

04:32:39.610 --> 04:32:42.646 region:rollup2
THE MASSIVE RECYCLING

04:32:40.911 --> 04:32:43.781 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE LOS BROUGHT TO

04:32:42.646 --> 04:32:45.115 region:rollup2
LIGHT MANY OF THE EXISTING

04:32:43.781 --> 04:32:46.951 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAM IN THESE

04:32:45.115 --> 04:32:48.886 region:rollup2
ISSUES INCLUDE FRAUD WITHIN THE

04:32:46.951 --> 04:32:50.254 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

04:32:48.886 --> 04:32:51.789 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAMS THE

04:32:50.254 --> 04:32:53.557 region:rollup2
PROGRAM'S RIGID STRUCTURE THAT

04:32:51.789 --> 04:32:54.859 region:rollup2
IMPEDED THE STATE'S ABILITY. TO

04:32:53.557 --> 04:32:56.527 region:rollup2
REACT TO CHANGING MARKET

04:32:54.859 --> 04:32:58.829 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AND CONSUMER

04:32:56.527 --> 04:33:00.798 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS AND THE PROGRAMS

04:32:58.829 --> 04:33:01.899 region:rollup2
ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND

04:33:00.798 --> 04:33:03.434 region:rollup2
FINALLY AN OVER RELIANCE ON

04:33:01.899 --> 04:33:05.870 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS FOR FINANCING THE

04:33:03.434 --> 04:33:07.171 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. IDEAS ON HOW TO REFORM

04:33:05.870 --> 04:33:09.273 region:rollup2
THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM HAVE

04:33:07.171 --> 04:33:11.775 region:rollup2
BEEN SUED YET A COMPREHENSIVE

04:33:09.273 --> 04:33:13.477 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HAS REMAINED ELUSIVE.

04:33:11.775 --> 04:33:15.546 region:rollup2
TODAY THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH

04:33:13.477 --> 04:33:16.747 region:rollup2
CONTRACTION IN THIS AREA THAT TO

04:33:15.546 --> 04:33:19.783 region:rollup2
MANY AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

04:33:16.747 --> 04:33:21.452 region:rollup2
HAVE LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO

04:33:19.783 --> 04:33:22.987 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES.

04:33:21.452 --> 04:33:25.189 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF RECYCLING

04:33:22.987 --> 04:33:27.491 region:rollup2
CENTER NEARBY GROCERS ARE

04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:29.326 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY LAW CURRENTLY TO

04:33:27.491 --> 04:33:32.196 region:rollup2
TAKE BACK THE CONTAINERS. OR PAY

04:33:29.326 --> 04:33:34.898 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY FINE.

04:33:32.196 --> 04:33:36.600 region:rollup2
BUT MOST TRAGICALLY IS THAT MORE

04:33:34.898 --> 04:33:37.901 region:rollup2
AND MORE CONTAINERS THAT COULD

04:33:36.600 --> 04:33:39.470 region:rollup2
BE AND SHOULD BE RECYCLED

04:33:37.901 --> 04:33:41.305 region:rollup2
RECYCLED ARE ENDING UP IN OUR

04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:42.740 region:rollup2
LANDFILLS OUR WATERWAYS. AND ARE

04:33:41.305 --> 04:33:43.874 region:rollup2
OCEAN SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM

04:33:42.740 --> 04:33:45.309 region:rollup2
IS BROKEN.

04:33:43.874 --> 04:33:46.677 region:rollup2
IN FACT IN THE LATEST ANNUAL

04:33:45.309 --> 04:33:48.912 region:rollup2
REPORT PUBLISHED BY RECENT CAO

04:33:46.677 --> 04:33:50.848 region:rollup2
RECYCLE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER

04:33:48.912 --> 04:33:52.383 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE HAS NOW FALLEN

04:33:50.848 --> 04:33:54.051 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWENTY

04:33:52.383 --> 04:33:55.119 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN. AND HAS REACHED ITS

04:33:54.051 --> 04:33:56.420 region:rollup2
LOWEST LEVEL SINCE TWO THOUSAND

04:33:55.119 --> 04:33:58.155 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

04:33:56.420 --> 04:33:59.323 region:rollup2
THIS DOWNWARD TREND IS EXPECTED

04:33:58.155 --> 04:34:01.325 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE ABSENT IMMEDIATE

04:33:59.323 --> 04:34:03.127 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

04:34:01.325 --> 04:34:05.429 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE IS

04:34:03.127 --> 04:34:06.730 region:rollup2
NOT A PANACEA BUT IT ATTEMPTS

04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:08.565 region:rollup2
TO TAKE SMALL STEPS TO IMPROVE

04:34:06.730 --> 04:34:10.701 region:rollup2
AND MODERNIZE THE BOTTLE BILL

04:34:08.565 --> 04:34:13.103 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BY. AUTHORIZING CAO

04:34:10.701 --> 04:34:14.605 region:rollup2
RECYCLE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS

04:34:13.103 --> 04:34:16.206 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE IMPROVE CONVENIENCE

04:34:14.605 --> 04:34:17.808 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS.

04:34:16.206 --> 04:34:19.710 region:rollup2
BY REMOVING OPERATIONAL

04:34:17.808 --> 04:34:21.578 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS WE HOPE TO ENABLE

04:34:19.710 --> 04:34:23.314 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WITHIN

04:34:21.578 --> 04:34:24.581 region:rollup2
THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM.

04:34:23.314 --> 04:34:26.884 region:rollup2
I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A LOT

04:34:24.581 --> 04:34:28.452 region:rollup2
OF FUN APPREHENSION AROUND

04:34:26.884 --> 04:34:30.254 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CAO RECYCLE WITH THIS

04:34:28.452 --> 04:34:32.222 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY BUT THE FACT OF THE

04:34:30.254 --> 04:34:33.757 region:rollup2
MATTER IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

04:34:32.222 --> 04:34:35.793 region:rollup2
APPROACH. ON DEFINING

04:34:33.757 --> 04:34:36.260 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE JUST DOESN'T WORK

DO.

04:39:40.998 --> 04:39:43.900 region:rollup2
AS IN THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD A

04:39:42.666 --> 04:39:45.302 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

04:39:43.900 --> 04:39:47.237 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN RAISED. FIRST A BILL

04:39:45.302 --> 04:39:48.605 region:rollup2
NOT TAKING THE COUNTRY POSITION

04:39:47.237 --> 04:39:50.240 region:rollup2
TO THE GOVERNOR'S ZERO MISSION

04:39:48.605 --> 04:39:51.708 region:rollup2
TRUST TRANSPORTATION GOALS. IN

04:39:50.240 --> 04:39:53.076 region:rollup2
FACT AT LEAST ONE OF FEELS THAT

COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL

04:39:53.076 --> 04:39:56.046 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT TODAY

HYDROGEN IS A ZERO EMISSION FUEL

04:39:56.046 --> 04:39:59.449 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE POINT.

04:39:57.447 --> 04:40:00.751 region:rollup2
POINT THEY RAISE THE BILL IS NOT

04:39:59.449 --> 04:40:02.653 region:rollup2
TAKING FUNDING FROM A NOBLE

04:40:00.751 --> 04:40:04.021 region:rollup2

ALTHOUGH RELATED DISCUSSION. AND

04:40:11.528 --> 04:40:15.565 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE

04:40:13.130 --> 04:40:17.301 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO IS.

04:40:15.565 --> 04:40:19.436 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ABOUT BENEFITING A

04:40:17.301 --> 04:40:20.570 region:rollup2
COMPANY OR A FUEL THE TECHNOLOGY

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDY AND ARE LESS

04:40:55.038 --> 04:40:58.809 region:rollup2
RISKY TWO PROJECT DEVELOPERS.

04:40:57.808 --> 04:41:00.343 region:rollup2

05:04:50.539 --> 05:04:53.308 region:rollup2
IT'S DIMINISHING IN OUR OPINION

05:04:52.074 --> 05:04:54.610 region:rollup2

WHEN YOU SAY THAT THIS IS NOT IT

05:13:38.033 --> 05:13:40.335 region:rollup2
WHAT REALLY MAKES YOUR PROGRAM

05:13:39.367 --> 05:13:42.103 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY'RE

05:13:40.335 --> 05:13:43.505 region:rollup2
PROVIDING AND.

05:13:42.103 --> 05:13:44.806 region:rollup2
AND YET BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE I

05:13:43.505 --> 05:13:46.207 region:rollup2

I I BELIEVE I SAID OFTENTIMES

05:13:50.445 --> 05:13:53.448 region:rollup2
BUT IF I DIDN'T I I CERTAINLY

05:13:52.080 --> 05:13:55.617 region:rollup2
MEANT THAT ONE UNIQUE

05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:56.818 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS AND ALSO

05:13:55.617 --> 05:13:58.787 region:rollup2
THE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION

05:13:56.818 --> 05:13:59.721 region:rollup2
CORPS. IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE

05:13:58.787 --> 05:14:01.122 region:rollup2
THEIR GED.

05:13:59.721 --> 05:14:03.058 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY'RE DOING THIS PROGRAM

05:14:01.122 --> 05:14:05.527 region:rollup2
WHILE EARNING BURNING MONEY

05:14:03.058 --> 05:14:07.362 region:rollup2
GETTING A GED AND ALSO LEARNING

05:14:05.527 --> 05:14:08.797 region:rollup2
VALUABLE SKILLS I THINK THAT'S

05:14:07.362 --> 05:14:09.631 region:rollup2
REALLY ONE OF THE MOST OF THOSE

05:14:08.797 --> 05:14:12.267 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T DEFINING

05:14:09.631 --> 05:14:14.269 region:rollup2
FACTORS BUT TO SAY. THAT. ONLY

05:14:12.267 --> 05:14:15.236 region:rollup2
ONE WHAT DOES ONE PATH AND IS

05:14:14.269 --> 05:14:17.005 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE PATH.

05:14:15.236 --> 05:14:18.340 region:rollup2
I I YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE

05:14:17.005 --> 05:14:19.908 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS

05:14:18.340 --> 05:14:20.442 region:rollup2
BUILDS LITTLE LITTLE BRIDGES

05:14:19.908 --> 05:14:21.810 region:rollup2
OVER CREEK THEY HAVE IN MY

05:14:20.442 --> 05:14:22.377 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

05:14:21.810 --> 05:14:23.578 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE LABOR DOESN'T LIKE

05:14:22.377 --> 05:14:27.082 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:14:23.578 --> 05:14:29.851 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHY IS THE

05:14:27.082 --> 05:14:32.020 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS SO

05:14:29.851 --> 05:14:33.988 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN SO MANY AREAS OF

05:14:32.020 --> 05:14:36.391 region:rollup2
OUR STATE. AND I THINK THIS

05:14:33.988 --> 05:14:38.526 region:rollup2
ISN'T JUST A SMALL ADDITION TO

05:14:36.391 --> 05:14:40.295 region:rollup2
THEIR MISSION US AT A A SLIGHT

05:14:38.526 --> 05:14:42.297 region:rollup2
VARIATION ON THE THEME YOU KNOW

05:14:40.295 --> 05:14:44.699 region:rollup2
IT BASICALLY BUILT ON THE SAME

05:14:42.297 --> 05:14:46.101 region:rollup2
KIND OF OF SKILLS. AND THIS IS

05:14:44.699 --> 05:14:47.569 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AVENUE IN ANOTHER

05:14:46.101 --> 05:14:49.104 region:rollup2

MAY BE AT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY

05:14:51.339 --> 05:14:54.542 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE

05:14:53.508 --> 05:14:56.211 region:rollup2
ANYBODY DO ANYTHING

05:14:54.542 --> 05:14:57.345 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT THEY CAN AVAIL

05:14:56.211 --> 05:14:58.780 region:rollup2

DONE THIS AND GOTTEN A TASTE AND

05:14:58.780 --> 05:15:01.316 region:rollup2
