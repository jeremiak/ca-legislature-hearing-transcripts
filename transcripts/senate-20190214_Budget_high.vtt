FOR MOST WITHOUT SUBSIDIES.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.314
AND THEY'RE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:56.582
HAVE EMPLOYER SPONSORED

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.451
INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY TEND TO

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.919
WORK IN OCCUPATIONS AND

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.688
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:07.293
TO OFFER INSURANCE TO WORKERS.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.662
AND SO ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.064
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE INCOME

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.200
LOW ENOUGH THAT THEY MEET THE

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.836
INCOME CRITERIA FOR MEDI CAL OR

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.571
HAVE INCOME AT OR BELOW A

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.506
HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.340
POVERTY LEVEL.

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.042
SO A LOT OF THE THE POLICY

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.077
DISCUSSION HAS FOCUSED ON

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:27.079
EXPANDING MEDIC HOUSE.

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:29.115
AS A FIRST STEP TO CLOSING THE

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.950
COVERAGE GAPS FOR UNDOCUMENTED

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:34.187
CALIFORNIANS.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.556
AMONG LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.858
ADULTS AND PARTICULARLY THE THAT

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.927
I'M INSURANCE RATE IS ESPECIALLY

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:44.297
HIGH A 90% OF LOW INCOME

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.631
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:46.699
UNANSWERED.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.201
BASED ON ESTIMATES BY MY

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:51.003
COLLEAGUE PROFESSOR PERON AT

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.071
UCLA.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.006
THAT'S COMPARED TO A 10% AN

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:56.075
INSURANCE RATE FOR CITIZENS AND

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.212
DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS OF THE

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:01.647
SAME INCOME RAINS.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.350
SOME OF THESE UNINSURED ADULTS.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.452
DO YOU HAVE RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.320
MEDI CAL --

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.422
WHICH USING FEDERAL AND STATE

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.591
FUNDS COVERS EMERGENCY AND

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.160
PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES.

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:17.563
BUT UNLESS ONE IS PREGNANT

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.031
RESTRICTED SCHEMATIC HELL DOES

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.766
NOT COVER PREVENTIVE CARE

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.636
PRIMARY CARE DRUGS AND OTHER

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.371
BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.839
LESS THE REQUIRED FOR THE

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.708
TREATMENT OF AN EMERGENCY

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:32.912
MEDICAL CONDITION.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:35.248
SO WE DO HAVE A TO A TO A

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.149
PATCHWORK SYSTEM BETWEEN

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.051
RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AND

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.520
INSERTING A COUNTY IS CERTAIN

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.189
UNDOCUMENTED DULTS ARE ELIGIBLE

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.657
FOR ACCESS TO CERTAIN HEALTH

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.392
CARE SERVICES LIKE IN HELL THE

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.894
SAN FRANCISCO AND AND MY HEALTH

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.595
LA PROGRAMS --

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.030
AND ALSO --

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.832
THE SAFETY NET HEALTHCARE SYSEM

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.367
PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.835
IN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:58.638
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.106
BUT IT IN SPITE OF THAT

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.575
PATCHWORK SYSTEM AND DOCUMENTED

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.709
CALIFORNIANS.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.612
HAVE WORSE ACCESS TO CARE SO

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.980
THIS IS ALSO RESEARCH FOR MY

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.683
COLLEAGUE AT UCLA SHOWING THAT

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.921
UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME ADULTS --

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.356
44% OF THEM REPORTED NOT HAVING

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.091
A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE THE LOT

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.394
HIGHER THAN THE 24% OF THEIR

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.029
CITIZEN UNDOCUMENTED

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:26.299
COUNTERPARTS IN THE SAME INCOME

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.833
RAINS.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.834
AND IN TH REPORT WE OFFER OTHER

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.769
EXAMPLES FROM THE THAT THE

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:32.071
RESEARCH THAT SHOW THE WORST

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.773
ACCESS TO CARE THAT THE THIS

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:38.377
POPULATION PIECES.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.979
A BUT THE THE THE RESEARCH

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.747
EVIDENCE DOES SHOW THAT WHEN

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.082
PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEIR

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.052
ACCESS TO CARE AND THEIR HEALTH --

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:51.390
IS BETTER A THE THERE'S A LOT OFRESEARCH ON INSURANCE EXPANSIONS

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:52.725
THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO THE

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:53.826
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT LAKE

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.094
MASSACHUSETTS STATE HEALTH

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.062
REFORM.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.330
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.531
OF RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:01.434
YEARS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.402
MEDICAID EXPANSION.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:04.203
AND THE IMPACTS --

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.138
THEY'VE HAD AND AND SO IN TERMS

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:09.909
OF THE HEALTH AND ACCESS TO CARE.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.310
HAVING INSURANCE HAS BEEN

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.379
ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED USE OF

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.514
PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.183
PRIMARY CARE --

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.986
GETTING MORE REGULAR CARE IF YOU

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:21.420
HAVE A CHRONIC CONDITION

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.622
IMPROVED ACCESS TO TO MENTAL

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.524
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND AND

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.727
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.061
A INSURANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:33.532
READ SPITTLE EMISSIONS AND EVEN

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.768
REDUCE DEATH RATES.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.636
INSURANCE ALSO HAS BENEFITS FOR

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.305
PEOPLE'S FINANCIAL SECURITY IN

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:42.875
TERMS OF REDUCE DEBT REDUCED --

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.877
COLLECTIONS.

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.979
AND AND PEOPLE REPORT FEWER

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.215
PROBLEMS PAYING MEDICAL BILLS

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.150
WHEN THEY HAVE INSURANCE.

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:52.518
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:53.853
RESEARCH SHOWING IMPROVED

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.554
WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY WITH

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.922
INSURANCE --

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.457
ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT PEOPLE

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:00.393
WITH INSURANCE.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.161
MISS FEWER DAYS OF WORK.

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.163
AND THERE'S RESEARCH FROM THE

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.165
INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE IN TWO

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.533
THOUSAND AND NINE THAT SHOWED.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.101
AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.237
AND INSURANCE RATES EVEN

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.339
INSERTED ADULTS REPORTED MORE

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:15.775
DIFFICULTY OBTAINING CARE AND

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.910
WERE LESS SATISFIED WITH THE

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:23.249
CARE THAT THEY RECEIVED.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:25.751
SO CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.453
SOME BIG AND IMPORTANT STEPS

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.588
TOWARDS MORE INCLUSIVE MEDI CAL

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:32.725
ELIGIBILITY POLICIES RECOGNIZING

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.060
THE VALUE THAT INSURANCE HAS.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:38.431
A USING STATE FUNDS OF MEDIC HAL

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.399
OFFERS FULL BENEFITS --

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:41.700
TO LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:42.868
WHO'VE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY LESS

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.905
THAN FIVE YEARS. TWO ADULTS WITH

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.973
DHAKA A DEFERRED ACTION OR

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.909
CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS AND STARTING

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:52.111
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ALL LOW

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.679
INCOME CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.181
IMMIGRATION STATUS.

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:57.950
SO NOW 200- AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.118
UNDOCUMENTED KIDS IN THE STATE

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:01.353
HAVE FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS AND

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.656
MANY OF THOSE WERE ALREADY

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:05.024
ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.059
MEDI CAL PRIOR TO THE EXPANSION

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:08.160
AND WE'RE AUTOMATICALLY

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.362
TRANSITION TO THOSE FULL

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:15.634
BENEFITS.

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:16.702
SO I. ESTIMATE THAT

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:19.171
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE FIVE

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.940
MILLION UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS IN

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:23.776
THE STATE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:26.112
FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS IF A AND

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:27.913
EXPANSION OCCURRED --

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.883
OF THOSE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:31.550
TWO THOUSAND OR THE VAST

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:33.752
MAJORITY ARE ALREADY AND ROLLED

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.321
IN RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL.

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:36.856
AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR TWO

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:40.025
REASONS COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.228
TRANSITION TO FULL COVERAGE ON

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:43.496
THE FIRST DAY THE POLICY WAS

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:44.864
EFFECTIVE --

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.366
BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE THE

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.601
INVESTMENT OF THE STATE WOULD

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.236
MAKE AN PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:53.205
CARE WOULD BUILD ON THE EXISTING

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:54.540
FEDERAL AND STATE SPENDING

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.941
THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING FOR

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.843
EMERGENCY IN PREGNANCY RELATED

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.946
SERVICES.

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:02.681
SO THERE I ESTIMATED THAT

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.317
APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:05.851
TEN THOUSAND WHO WOULD BE

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.419
ELIGIBLE BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.721
ENROLLED IN RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.356
MEDI CAL.

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.525
AND THERE'S THESE OF UNCERTAINTY

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.893
ABOUT HOW MANY OF THOSE WOULDN'T

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.329
ROLL BUT I HAVE ASSUME THAT 50%.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.732
WITH WITH NEARLY AND ENROLLIN

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.000
MEDIC HOW AND THAT THAT'S

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:22.535
INTENDED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.303
THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.871
UNDOCUMENTED LOW INCOME ADULTS

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.307
DO YOU HAVE A PRIVATE INSURANCE

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:28.941
MOSTLY.

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:31.310
EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.112
ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.981
INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.816
PRIVATE INSURANCE.

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:38.384
AND THERE IS THERE IS SOME

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.186
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ALL OF THE

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:41.353
ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.122
ESTIMATES ÐAUSE

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.089
ASK.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.224
OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.226
UNDOCUMENTED STATUS THE HOUSE TO

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.827
BE INFERRED AFTER THE FACT BY

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.262
RESEARCHERS SO THERE IS

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.564
UNCERTAINTY BOTH ABOUT THE

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.432
OVERALL SIZE OF THE UNDOCUMENTED

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.833
POPULATION IN THE CITY.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:03.209
ENDS THEIR INCOME DISTRIBUTION.

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.544
SO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED A IN

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.647
TERMS OF IN ROMANS IN TERMS OF

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:09.381
NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:11.116
THOUSAND ADULTS TRANSITIONING TO

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.551
FULL BENEFITS FROM RESTRICTED

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.552
SCOTT MEDI CAL.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.754
AND ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.189
NEARLY AND ROLLING THAT'S WHAT I

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.225
CALLED SCENARIO ONE IN IN IN IN

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.759
MY REPORT THAT WOULD BE A TOTAL

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:23.229
OF ONE POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.698
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND ROLLING.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:26.265
I ALSO --

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:28.400
CONSIDERED A SECOND SCENARIO

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:30.402
WHICH I CALLED SCENARIO TO THAT

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.805
THAT RELATES TO FEDERAL

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:35.975
PROPOSALS AROUND PUBLIC CHARGE.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:42.815
SO IN OCTOBER THE A PROPOSED TO

00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.116
THE TO TOUGHEN AND GREATLY

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:47.853
EXPANDS AN EXISTING POLICY.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.822
ALL THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND

00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:51.824
THIS WOULD MEAN THAT IF THIS

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.759
GOES INTO A FACT THAT THE

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.327
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD DENY

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.329
PEOPLE GREEN CARDS ARE VISA.

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.465
VISAS BASED ON THEIR USE OF

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.200
CERTAIN PUBLIC PROGRAMS

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:04.536
INCLUDING THE MEDICAID.

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:07.106
AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THIS

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.009
IF THE RULE IS FINALIZED --

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:10.876
THAT IT WOULD HAVE A CHILLING

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:13.345
EFFECT ON IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:14.847
TERMS OF THEIR ENROLLMENT PUBLIC

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.215
PROGRAMS --

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.183
INCLUDING AMONG THOSE NOT

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.252
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE RULE

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.820
THE RULE IS VERY COMPLEX THERE'S

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.355
LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.857
AND FEAR --

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:27.426
AND AND BASED ON EXPERIENCE WITH

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:28.961
WELFARE REFORM IN THE NINETIES

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.429
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:31.964
COULD BE A BROADER A CHILLING

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.299
EFFECTS.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:34.500
AND SO.

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:38.270
IT IN OUR RESEARCH WITH UCLA ON

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.306
ON THIS.

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.807
BECAUSE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.709
AS A HIGH AND THIS IN A MOMENT

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.210
SCENARIO.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.545
WE ASSUMES THAT UP.

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.347
TO THE IN ROMAN COULD DROP BY UP

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:49.581
235% --

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:52.451
AMONG CERTAIN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES --

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.586
AND OTHER RESEARCHERS NATIONALLY

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:57.456
MADE A SIMILAR ASSUMPTION IN

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:58.691
THEIR ANALYSIS.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.125
AND SO OF A IN TERMS OF APPLYING

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.160
THAT ASSUMPTION TO AND

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:03.696
DOCUMENTED OLD SPECIFICALLY I

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:04.797
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE PUBLIC

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.532
CHARGE TESTS WOULD NOT APPLY

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.067
IT'S TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.469
SERVICES.

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.805
AND IT ALSO WOULD NOT APPLY TO

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.040
STATE FUNDED BENEFITS OF THE

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.476
THAT ARE NOT CASH ASSISTANCE --

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.745
HOWEVER THE THE BROADER CHILLING

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.513
EFFECTS BECAUSE THE RULE IS SO

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.182
COMPLEX --

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.651
IS LIKELY TO ALSO APPLIES TO

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.753
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS BOTH IN

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.388
TERMS OF RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:30.789
CAL ENROLLMENT AND IF AN

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:33.392
EXPANSION OCCURS IN TERMS OF

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.793
FULL SCOPE BENEFITS.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.763
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN THIS THIS

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.565
CHILLING EFFECT WOULD HAPPEN THE

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.200
RULE HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED IT'S

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.234
NOT CLEAR WHEN IT WOULD BE

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.336
EFFECTIVE IF IT IS FINALIZED.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.604
AND ALSO --

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.706
HOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE FOR

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.408
THIS CHILLING EFFECTIVE FULLY

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:50.976
OCCUR -- OF

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.678
THESE THE SECOND SCENARIO IS

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.280
REALLY INTENDED TO SIGNIFY AND

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.483
SO THAT THIS PROPOSED PUBLIC

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.651
CHARGE RULE NOT ONLY THREATENS

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.053
OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF MEDIC HELLO

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.621
ENROLLMENT --

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.856
BUT COULD HINDER THE STATE'S

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.091
EFFORTS TO GET CLOSER TO

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:10.062
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.530
LESLIE -- IN

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.365
TERMS OF WHO IT IN THE ROLE OF

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:16.402
THE UNDER AN EXPANSION MOST OF

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.736
THOSE WHO WOULD IN ROLE WOULD BE

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.872
WORKING NEEDS A NON DISABLED

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:20.973
ADULTS.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:23.575
ABOUT THE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 2%

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.810
OF THOSE WHO WOULD IN ROLE WOULD

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.212
BE SENIOR IS OVER THE AGE OF

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.547
SIXTY FIVE AND THAT'S CONSISTENT

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:30.749
WITH THE SHARE OF THE OVERALL

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:33.285
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION THAT

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.520
SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER.

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.922
AND THE FEW WOULD BE DISABLED --

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.191
BECAUSE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:41.093
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS HAVE A LOWER

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.930
RATE OF A DISABILITY THAN OTHER

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.632
WORKING AGE ADULTS.

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:47.666
AND FINALLY AYE ESTIMATE THAT

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.068
AROUND A HUNDRED AND FOUR

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.004
THOUSAND YOUNG ADULTS WOULD AND

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:57.776
ROLL UNDER AN EXPANSION.

00:17:57.843 --> 00:17:59.077
SO JUST TO SUM UP UNDOCUMENTED

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.079
CALIFORNIANS ARE THE LARGEST

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:03.415
GROUP OF UNINSURED AND LOW

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.083
INCOME UNDOCUMENTED.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.653
HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH AND

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.121
INSURANCE RATE OF 90%.

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.589
IN THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.191
THIS IS A GROUP THAT HAS BURST

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.326
ACCESS TO CARE --

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:17.129
BUT THE THE THE READ SHARON'S

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.964
CAN IMPROVE THAT ACCESS AND IT

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.566
CAN ALSO IMPROVE HEALTH AND

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.901
FINANCIAL SECURITY AND WORKFORCE

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.369
PRODUCTIVITY.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.472
OF THE ESTIMATE THAT ONE POINT

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.639
ONE FIVE MILLION ADULTS WOULD BE

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.708
ELIGIBLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.610
THOSE ARE ALREADY --

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.078
IN RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDI CAL AND

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.246
COULD BE AUTOMATICALLY

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.415
TRANSITIONS AND DEPENDING ON

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.516
WHAT HAPPENS WITH FEDERAL

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.152
IMMIGRATION POLICY AND HOW AND

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.020
PEOPLE RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.922
OF THEIR ENROLLMENT DECISIONS.

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.991
BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.993
THOUSAND AND ONE POINT ZERO FIVE

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.760
MILLION COULD IN RAW.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.195
A AND THAT WOULD MEAN A

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:51.730
REDUCTION IN THE STATE'S

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.366
UNINSURED POPULATION BY UP TO

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.368
ONE QUARTER.

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:57.169
I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS THANK

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:00.005
YOU.

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:02.608
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MONEY.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.243
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THANK

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.680
OVERVIEW --

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.916
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RESPECTIVE

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.185
IMPACT TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.354
REGULATIONS OF THE PROPOSED

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.789
EXPANSION OF OF THOSE.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:18.991
THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.225
SHOWING A CURRENT.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.693
CHILLING EFFECT IN THE

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.762
COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT PEOPLE

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.130
AREN'T WAITING STATE THEY'RE

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.131
ALREADY.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.200
PULLING BACK FROM PROGRAMS THEY

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.736
MIGHT CURRENTLY BE ELIGIBLE.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.104
FOR BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT IN

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.572
THE COMMUNITY OF ADVERSE

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:36.375
IMMIGRATION IMPACT.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:37.876
HE I HAVE IN A I'VE I'VE ONLY

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:38.977
LOOKED IN MEDI CAL I HAVEN'T

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:39.912
LOOKED AT CONFERENCE OROTHER

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:41.647
PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:42.881
AFFECTED --

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.449
AND IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.318
ENROLLMENTS --

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.486
THERE HAS BEEN A A SLIGHT

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:50.188
DECLINE IN OVERALL MEDI CAL

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:52.624
ENROLLMENTS AND AM A SLIGHTLY

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.359
LARGER DECLINE AMONG.

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:56.728
THOSE IN RESTRICTED SCOPE BUT A

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.030
IS BOTH THE KINDS HAVE BEEN IN

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.565
THE RANGE OF A FEW PERCENTAGE

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.333
POINTS AND THERE ARE OTHER

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.702
FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:05.103
ENROLLMENT LEVELS LIKE.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.638
THE STRONG ECONOMY WE HAVE RIGHT

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.373
NOW LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.609
INCREASE AND SO IT'S HARD TO

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.344
DISENTANGLE --

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:17.983
WHAT THE FACTS AND THE HI MINTA

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.319
FEAR IS HAVING ON ENROLLMENTS?

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.020
THANK YOU AND THEN WITH RESPECT

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:24.256
TO THE RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.191
ELIGIBILITY.

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.093
FOR PREGNANT HOMES --

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.596
YOU INCLUDE THEM ALSO IN THE IN

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:33.599
THE CATEGORY THE ARE CONCERNED --

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:36.301
COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE PUBLIC

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.903
CHARGE --

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.505
AMBER STATION IF YOU WILL

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:40.806
[inaudible]

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:43.976
YES THE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.144
OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE REAL FOR

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.646
PREGNANT WOMEN ARE ARE MORE

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.815
COMPLICATED TO RULE THE PROPOSAL

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.149
DOES SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:54.019
EMERGENCY MEDICAID BENEFITS BUT

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.621
DOES NOT EXCLUDE PIC PREGNANCY

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:58.256
RELATED BENEFITS BUT I THINK

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.225
THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:01.426
WOMEN WHO ARE INVOLVED IN IN

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.829
PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES FOR A

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.230
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THE BE

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:07.232
PENALIZED UNDERTHE PART PUBLIC

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.533
CHARGE TEST --

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.636
BUT I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:12.804
DIFFERENTLY IN MY ANALYSIS FOR

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.973
PREGNANT WOMEN THAN. FOR OTHER

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.209
ADULTS THANK YOU KNOW I THINK

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.477
THE CONCERN IS.

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:21.179
EVEN IF REGULATIONS CARVE OUT --

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.148
PROTECT.

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.317
ACCESS OR ELIGIBILITY.

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:29.755
THE THIS DIG MONTH OF JUST FEAR

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.723
IN THE COMMUNITY --

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.326
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERRIDE

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:34.626
[inaudible]

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:37.429
THAT ELIGIBILITY WITH PEOPLE.

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.964
WANTING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:42.501
SAFETY AND NOT ACCESSING --

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.603
PROGRAMS THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.171
FOR RATE THE RULE IS EXTREMELY

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:48.006
COMPLEX THEY CAN'T TELL ME TELL

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:49.408
YOU HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT ON

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.876
CALLS WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS ALL

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.110
OF US TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.812
ROLE IN AND SO THERE'S GONNA BE

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:57.115
A LOT OF CONFUSION AND FEAR --

00:21:57.182 --> 00:22:02.888
ANDS -- IT

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:03.989
M. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:04.823
AFFECTED BY THE RULE BECAUSE

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.024
THEY ALREADYHAVE A GREEN CARD

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.894
OR MAY NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.028
TO GET A GREEN CARD.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.863
A A COULD EXPERIENCE THIS

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.131
CHILLING EFFECT AND AND AND

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:14.366
THERE COULD BE A CHILLING EFFECT

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.601
ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.904
NAMED IN THE RULE AS WELL.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.005
IF I MAY JUST ASK IN ANOTHER

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:26.878
pPRESENTATION THE HEALTH AND LIST

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.613
THE BENEFITS OF THOSE WHO DO

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.716
HAVE INSURANCE FROM ACCESS TO

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:32.451
PREVENTIVE CARE.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.953
PRIMARY CARE SERVICES --

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.622
AND A NUMBER OF BENEFITS --

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:40.092
MEASURED IN THESE CATEGORIES.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:43.762
DO YOU HAVE. FOUR DO YOU HAVE OR

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:46.031
IS THERE ANY INDEX THAT ALONG

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:48.867
WITH THIS ACCESS SHOWS.

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.135
SAVINGS --

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.337
COST SAVINGS FOR PEOPLE TO GET

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:55.474
FRONT END MEDICAL SERVICES WHO

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.442
WARRANT THEN ACCESSING EMERGENCY

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.777
ROOM SERVICES OR GOING ON

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:01.346
TREATED IN HAVING AN AND TREATED.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:03.782
EARLY CONDITION MANIFESTS IN A

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:06.718
FULL BLOWN --

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.153
MEDICAL CRISIS.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.554
I I THINK THE STRONGEST

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.490
EVIDENCES THAT THAT PREVENTIVE

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.858
AND PRIMARY CARE REALLY BENEFITS

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.192
HEALTH --

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.261
THAT THE RESEARCH IS MORE MIXED

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:17.662
ON THE AFFECT THE INSURANCE HAS

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.365
ON THE USE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.100
ON THE ONE HAND WHEN PEOPLE GET

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:23.902
PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE IT

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:25.804
CAN PREVENT AND CERTAIN MORE

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.974
COSTLY CARE DOWN THE LINE BUT ON

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.708
THE OTHER HAND.

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.878
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:35.046
A IT IS IT'S EXPENSIVE TO TO

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:36.748
VISIT THE EMERGENCY ROOM --

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.550
AND SO THE THE EVIDENCE ON WHAT

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.118
BUT A FACT THAT PASSED

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.686
EXPANSIONS HAVE HOME EMERGENCY

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.289
ROOM USES IS MIXED IN AND

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.724
GENERAL I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.492
THIS EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.761
SOME STATE INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:50.829
I GUESS [inaudible]

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:53.431
THE CHALLENGES.

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:54.800
THERE'S A HUMANITARIAN SIDE OF

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.535
THIS THAT WOULD SUGGEST

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.869
HEALTHCARE FOR ALL.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.538
BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:01.473
REDUCES DISEASE AN ILLNESS THAT

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.974
SENTRA.

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.276
BUT FROM A BUDGET SIDE --

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.477
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK TO

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.612
UNDERSTAND THAT ANYTHING WE

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.182
MIGHT INVEST IN A FRONT END TO

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.251
BROADEN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:14.553
CARE.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.688
HAS A LONG TERM BUDGET BENEFIT

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:18.023
IS WELL AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.758
LIKE FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:21.927
WE DON'T HAVE THAT DISPOSITIVE

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.528
EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT THAT.

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.463
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.132
UNDERSTAND LOOKING AT IT

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.134
STRICTLY FROM A IN BUDGET

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:30.969
INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW.

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:34.973
IN OUT YEARS CAN WE REDUCE ON TO

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.808
THE STATE BUDGET BY GETTING

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.710
PEOPLE ENROLLED IN.

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.979
PREVENTION PROGRAMS ACCESS TO

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:43.315
PRIMARY CARE AT CENTER SO MORE

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:44.583

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.138
EXPERIENCES CHAIR OF THE

HOSPITAL COMMITTEE IN SANTA

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:04.075
CLARA COUNTY --

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:05.477
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.445
WOULD SAVE MONEY.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:08.880
OF FROM THE MEDICAL SYSTEM

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:09.981
PROBABLY --

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:11.416
AND A LOT OF OTHER.

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.752
SYSTEMS TO AND I'M I'M INCLUDING --

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.521
EDUCATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALL

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:20.825
THE OTHERS SYSTEMS AS WELL AS

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.927
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:24.028
AND NAM.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.463
HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESEARCH

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.799
QUANTIFYING OLE.

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.334
THOSE KINDS OF SAVINGS IN THIS

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.637
IN THIS AREA.

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.671
I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GOOD

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:35.373
NUMBERS ON THAT BUT I AGREE WITH

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.275
THE CONCEPT THAT YOU KNOW AS ONE

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:39.444
EXAMPLE THAT I MENTIONED IMPROVE

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.779
WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY WHEN

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.248
PEOPLE MISS FEWER DAYS.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:43.915
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE THEY

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.650
MISS FEWER DAYS OF WORK AND THAT

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.252
COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE BROADER

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.920
SAVINGS TO OUR SOCIETY IN?

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.655
EDUCATION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE OR

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:53.258
OTHER ARE OTHER GOOD EXAMPLES OF

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:56.194
THE I THINK IT'S JUST HARD TO TO

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.595
TO QUANTIFY THOSE IN AND TURN

00:29:57.662 --> 00:30:00.098
THOSE INTO INTO BUDGET ESTIMATES.

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:02.300
ANOTHER ANOTHER FINANCIAL IMPACT

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.468
THOUGH THAT I DO WANT TO MENTION

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.270
IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.906
CERTAINLY REDUCE UNCOMPENSATED

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.574
CARE COSTS FOR PROVIDERS --

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.177
THAT WOULD BE IT ANOTHER

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:15.280
RELEVANT.

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.314
THANK YOU SENATOR OFF.

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.815
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW I

DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:21.186
THAT WE NEED TO TRY.

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:23.087
TO COVER MORE FOLKS WITH

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.957
INSURANCE OF SOME SORT --

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:27.659
ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE PROBABLY

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:28.826
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WTH

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.061
THIS ESCALATING COSTS OF HEALTH

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.362
CARE.

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:33.865
MORE COVERAGE COMMUNITY CLINICS

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:37.435
AS OPPOSED TO EMERGENCY ROOMS.

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.736
BUT IF WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:40.638
AND OBVIOUSLY CHOICES HAVE BEEN

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:42.106
MADE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL.

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:44.042
TO EXPAND COVERAGE FOR THOSE

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:45.577
BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY SIX

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:48.813
YEARS OF AGE --

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.582
HAVE YOU ANALYZE THE PUBLIC

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.817
POLICY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.886
COVERING THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:55.720
SIX YEAR OLDS.

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.422
AS OPPOSED TO COVERING THOSE WHO

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:59.324
WERE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER OR

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.959
THOSE WHO WERE SIXTY OR OLDER.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:02.727
SENIORS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.896
HAVE SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:07.532
TO TODAY IF UNDOCUMENTED ARE NOT

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.566
COVERED.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:12.036
BY ANYTHING ANYWHERE.

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:12.670
WELL I THINK LIKE YOU SAID IT

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.239
REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO A PUBLIC

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:16.341
POLICY DECISION I MEAN BASED ON

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.610
OUR RESEARCH THERE'S A NEED FOR

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:21.246
FOR ALL. FOR INSURANCE ACROSS

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:23.014
ALL OF THESE AGE GROUPS --

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.483
BUT LIKE YOU SAID AS AS SOME

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.318
PEOPLE HAVE PROPOSED FOCUSING ON

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:29.787
SENIORS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THE

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:31.556
THE HIGHEST NEED FOR HEALTH CARE

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:34.225
SERVICES AND AND OTHERS HAVE A

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.693
PROPOSED FOCUSING ON YOUNG

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.995
ADULTS.

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.230
BECAUSE TODAY THERE ARE TO OUR

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:41.499
CHILDREN WHO ARE AGING OUT OF OF

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:43.401
MEDI CAL --

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.370
AND AN EXPANDING TO YOUNG ADULTS

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.638
WOULD.

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.806
PREVENT THAT AT LEAST FROM A FEW

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.509
YEARS FOR A FEW YEAR THE

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:52.977
AFFORDABLE.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:56.114
CARE ACT EXPANSION REQUIRING A

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.982
PRIVATE INSURERS TO ALLOW YOUNG

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.284
A YOUNG ADULT DEPENDENCE TO BE

ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN TO THEIR

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:03.421
TWENTY SIXTH BIRTHDAY.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.255
BUT I REALLY I REALLY THINK IT

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:04.822
DOES.

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.824
COME DOWN TO IT A PUBLIC POLICY

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.893
DECISION IF THE EXPANSION CAN'T

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.528
OCCUR TO ALL AGE GROUPS THAT

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.131
ONES IN TERMS OF DECIDING HOW TO

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.732
PRIORITIZE OTHER BEEN ANY

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.234
STUDIES DONE ON ON UTILIZATION

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:19.537
PROJECTED UTILIZATION RATES. FOR

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.472
THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEARS

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.741

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.379
THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY AND AND OVER.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.414
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.516
SPECIFICALLY FOR UNDOCUMENTED

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.285
ADULTS IN THOSE AGE GROUPS --

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:36.087
I AM SURE THERE CERTAINLY IS A%

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.022
RESEARCH ON ON DIFFERENCES AND

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.857
UTILIZATION BY AIDS ACROSS THE

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:42.994
BROADER POPULATION BY AGE GROUP.

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.062

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.805
AGAIN.

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.239
HE HAD TO JUST COUPLE DAYS AGO

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.841
I'M TALKING ABOUT FOR ABILITY --

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:59.977
SO FREE SHE YOUR PRESENTATION --

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:03.014
AYE AYE A THE FIRST OF ALL JUST.

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:05.083
TO SUCH A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT --

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:06.217
CENTER ROCK JUST ASKS ND TO TO

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:07.318
I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.152
WE TALK ABOUT.

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:10.188
SORT OF DOING EIGHTEEN TWENTY

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:12.223
SIX VERSES IN OLDER AGE GROUP --

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.759
WE TOUCH ON PREVENTION --

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.294
AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THAT THE OLDER

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:17.328
AGE GROUP HAS.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.596
PERHAPS GREATER IMMEDIATE HEALTH

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:22.133
NEEDS ARE NEEDS --

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.536
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY --

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:26.971
FOR PERHAPS MORE PREVENTION WITH

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.306
SOME THAT YOU'LL RECOGNIZE ALSO

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:29.774
THE IDEA IS THE ONE THAT OTHER

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:30.942
THINGS WHEN WE ENROLL MORE

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.310
PEOPLE INTO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.845
THINGS TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WHEN

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:35.012
SOMEONE HASN'T HAD CONSISTENT

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.848
HEALTH COVERAGE AND YOU CAN

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.049
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:38.783
THEY'RE NOT THAT FAMILIAR THE

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.351
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT HEALTH

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:41.619
COVERAGE RIGHT.

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.687
SO THE ACTAL TO LEARN HOW TO

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.589
USE IT SO WHAT YOU SEE IS WHEN

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.823
YOU FIRST DO AN EXPANSION YOU'LL

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.759
SEE SPIKE IN EMERGENCY ROOM USE

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:48.993
EVER GOES ALL WAIT A MINUTE I

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.761
THOUGHT COVERAGE SUPPOSED TO

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.195
LOWER EMERGENCY ROOM USE WELL IF

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.231
THAT'S WHAT YOUR NORMAL HABIT IS.

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.432
YOU DON'T GO THERE WHEN YOU'RE

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:55.099
ON INSURED BECAUSE IT'S

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.467
EXPENSIVE UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.202
TO BUT STILL THAT'S THE PLACE TO

00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:59.771
GO -- AND

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:02.907
AND BECAUSE THAT'S MAY BE YOUR

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.509
ONLY OPTION ARE ONE OF THE FEW

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:05.109
OPTIONS --

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:06.577
MAYBE IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE TO

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:07.278
HAVE A COMMUNITY CLINIC YOU

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.513
MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BUT SO YOU

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.514
HAVE TO HAVE TO TEACH PEOPLE TO

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.381
SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.083
WHERE YOU GO FIRST YOU ACTUALLY

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.184
HEAR YOU ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.485
OPTIONS NOW.

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.920
AND SO --

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.222
THAT BIT OF TRANSITION I THINK

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.323
IT'S SOMETHING SOMETIMES PEOPLE

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.159
DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR ROLLING

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:23.060
PEOPLE INTO COVERAGE THAT IS NOT

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:23.394
JUST ABOUT --

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.062
HERE'S INSURANCE CARD YEARS

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.165
MEDIC HOW YOU'RE GOOD IT'S LIKE

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.433
WELL HOW DO YOU USE IT.

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:31.702
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT CAN YOU

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:36.174
ACTUALLY ACT YEAH GO OFF AND?

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.042
THEY'LL GO OFF AND BE HEALTHY SO --

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:39.143
WE DO I THINK THERE'S AN

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.545
EDUCATION COMPONENT THERE AND I

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.246
SO WHEN WE SAW THAT HEALTHY

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.214
FAMILIES AND SO THE HELP EXACTLY

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.682
WHEN WE GAVE THE CHILDREN

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.217
COVERAGE BUT NOT THE PARENT

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.486
RIGHT SO SO I I GO THROUGH THIS

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.787
I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS JUST.

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:50.288
TO IN TERMS OF SETTING

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.089
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.558
EXPECT TO HAPPEN.

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:56.661
AND SO I THINK THAT SO THERE'S

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.362
SOME ARGUMENT TO SAY WE HAVE.

00:34:58.429 --> 00:34:59.497
HOPEFULLY WE HAVE --

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:01.532
KIDS WHO AS THEY GET OLDER YOU

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.634
CANDEVELOP MORE OF A HABITS A

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.436
SOCIAL NORM ABOUT COVERAGE THAT

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:06.671
WE CAN SUPPORT.

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.306
MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THAT WE

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:09.407
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT ON THE

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.342
BENEFIT SIDE OF WHY WE POLICY

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.578
WHY SHE'S ONE OR THE OTHER --

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:14.846
CERTAINLY THE UTILIZED LESS SO

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.514
WE CAN PROBABLY COVER MORE FOR

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.216
THE SAME AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AGAIN

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.451
THERE'S A PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.085
ABOUT WHERE THE NEED IS AND SO

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.187
FORTH -- I I

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:24.689
DO A TOUCH ABOUT SO AND YOU KNOW

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:25.423
WE MENTION THIS IN THE PREVIOUS

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.757
HEARING A LITTLE BIT BUT IN

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:29.293
TERMS OF EXPANDING.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.561
YOU KNOW --

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.796
THERE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:34.265
MEDICARE I'LL. TO LEARN AND

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:35.833
ROLLING AND THEN WE HAVE BEEN

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.134
DOCUMENTED WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.636
WE ALSO KNOW WE A LOT BLENDED

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.804
FAMILIES RIGHT YEAH.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:41.973
AND SO AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.441
FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:44.809
HEALTH CARE EXPENSES THAT.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.044
OFTENTIMES OF ONE FAMILY MEMBER

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:49.680
CAN'T GET AT THERE'S LESS

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.649
INCLINATION FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:52.517
TO ENROLL.

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.584
AND THEN WELL LATER ON TOP OF

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.786
THAT PUBLIC CHARGE RIGHT SO.

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.989
SO PUBLIC CHARGES IN JUST ABOUT --

00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:59.957
WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED MEMBERS OF

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.526
THE HOUSEHOLD WANT TO AFRAID TO

00:36:01.592 --> 00:36:03.027
TAKE PUBLIC SERVICES AT THE

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:03.761
WHOLE HOUSEHOLD.

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.730
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY'LL BE

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:08.799
LINKED TOGETHER SO REJECTION ON

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.335
SITE -- PAGE

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:12.470
FOR THE SLIDE --

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:14.839
IS.

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.707
DID YOU BUILD THEN FOR PUBLIC

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.543
CHARGE IN THIS AT ALL OR NOT SO

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:19.777
THIS IS JUST THE BETTER CASE

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.345
SCENARIO WITHOUT PUBLIC CHART

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:22.480
RIGHT THIS IS THE THE BETTER

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.148
CASE SCENARIO WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.384
ANY CHILLING EFFECT FROM PUBLIC

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.885
CHARTER FROM THE BROADER.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:29.820
IS FEAR THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.022
CREATED UNDER THE FEDERAL

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:32.423
ADMINISTRATION --

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.292
AND AND SO THIS PICTURE COULD BE

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:35.660
WORSE AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULES

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.762
FINALIZED SEPARATELY WE HAVE

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.764
DONE RESEARCH WITH THE UCLA

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.298
CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.265
RESEARCH.

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:43.501
ON HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS MIGHT

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:44.835
DESCEND ROLE FOR MEDI CAL AND

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:47.638
USING IT IN THAT RESEARCH.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.140
WE ESTIMATED THAT I THINK IS

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.742
AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.044
THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE MY AND

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.845
ROLE IN MEDIC HOW UNDER.

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:56.714
THE THE THE WORST CASE THE

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.849
FEDERAL MEANT SCENARIO THE 35%

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:01.185
ISN'T ROMANCE IN THE AREA AND

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:03.421
70% OF THOSE WHO WOULD DESCEND

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:04.722
ROLE FOR MEDI CAL WOULD BE.

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:06.490
ED CHILDREN MOSTLY CITIZENS

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.559
CHILDREN IN THESE THAT MAKE

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:11.162
STATUS FAMILIES.

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:11.862
OKAY.

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:18.069
I'D APPRECIATE YOU --

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:18.869
CLARIFYING THAT AND THE OTHER

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:21.172
QUESTION I JUST HAD WAS IS THAT --

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:24.275
SO YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT OF

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:26.043
MANY OF THE END DOCUMENT OUT --

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.878
ARE ABOUT ALMOST A MILLION ARE

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.580
RESTRICTED SKILL MEDI CAL BUT I

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.083
JUST WANT CLEAR FIGHT FOR

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:32.950
PEOPLE'S ACCESO PERSONAL --

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.085
PEOPLE ON RESTRICTED SKILL MEDI

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.286
CAL YOU CONSIDERED --

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.887
UNINSURED ARE DO YOU COUNT THEM

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:39.457
AND THEN SHARED --

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.559
IN IN THE IN ALL OF OUR

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.894
ESTIMATES INCLUDING INCLUDING

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:44.795
THE FIGHTING RAGES REFERENCING

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:46.831
AS THERE ARE PEOPLE UNDOCUMENTED

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:47.832
ADULTS WHO REPORT TO SURVEYS

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:48.666
LIKE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.135
INTERVIEW SURVEY AND TO THE

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.304
CENSUS THAT THEY MEDI CAL.

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.271
AND IN OUR ESTIMATES WE TREAT

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.373
THEM AS UNANSWERED BECAUSE WE

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.507
KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR ONLY

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:57.541
ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE LIMITED

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.543
SERVICES OKAY IT'S LIKE CLARIFY

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.779
THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS IS

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:01.979
THAT.

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.280
WHO?

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.715
SO SO WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:05.216
WHAT.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.884
A RESTRICTED MEDI CAL IS BECAUSE

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.986
OF BUT WHO CAN ACTUALLY ACT EVEN

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.789
ACCESS RESTRICTED MEDI CAL.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:12.356
WHICH WHICH PEOPLE ARE WE

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:13.424
TALKING ABOUT THOSE --

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.526
RESTRICTED SCOPE MEDI CAL AS IS

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.895
AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.164
EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:21.532
38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.768
WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:26.804
DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE PERSON. TO

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.371
IT REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:31.208
STATUS MOST OTHER.

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:34.011
THE MOST CITIZENS UNDOCUMENTED

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:35.379
PEOPLE IN THAT INCOME RANGE ARE

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:36.947
ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR FROM WITH

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:38.349
GOT MEDI CAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.484
RESTRICT IT'S GOT MEDI CAL BEING

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.119
FOR UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS.

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.255
OKAY BUT ANYONE OF THAT BELOW

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:45.489
THAT AIRING HAZARD AND THE

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.058
RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF SIGNING

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:50.061
UP BECAUSE IT IS A AND IS THAT

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:50.361
YOU HAVE --

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:51.395
YEAH [inaudible]

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:55.599
THE NO DID DID YOU HAVE ONE IN

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:56.567
THE OTHER SIDE TO SIDE SO

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.702
THROUGH JUST TO CLARIFY DOES AND

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.236
SO THAT AND THAT'S ONLY COURSE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:01.038
ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES.

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.540
EMERGENCY IN PREGNANCY RELATED

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.909
SERVICES ALSO USING STATE FUNDS

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.977
AND RESPECT IT'S GOT MEDI CAL

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:09.080
DOES PROVIDE SOME A NURSING HOME

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.549
SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:13.350
AND THERE ARE FEW OTHER AND

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.052
SMALL EXCEPTIONS LIKE THAT.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:18.189
SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST POINT

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:20.124
OUT THAT --

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.358
EVEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE TALKING

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.760
ABOUT WHETHER THE FIGHT COVERAGE

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:23.728
OR NOT CONFERENCE OF COVERAGE OR

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:24.128
NOT.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.763
I WOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT --

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.500
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE COVERAGE

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:30.167
NOT ONLY OF COURSE THEY SUFFERED

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.870
THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU OUTLINED

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:33.504
PRESENTATION WE'RE STILL PAYING

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:33.938
FOR THEM [inaudible]

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.173
HER.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.742
OR SO PAINFUL IN SOME WAY

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.944
WHETHER THROUGH --

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.145
YOU KNOW THROUGH RESTRICTED

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.713
SKILLED MEDI CAL ACTUALLY OR THE

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.814
OTHER WAY WE ACTUALLY PAID FOR

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:44.915
THEM IS IS THAT --

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:46.617
WHEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:47.952
FOR THE CARE THEY GET THOSE

00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:49.120
CLASS GETS SPREAD OUT TO

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.454
EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS INSURANCE

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.323
PRIVATE INSURANCE OTHER PEOPLE

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.657
SO FORTH THOSE COSTS GET SPREAD

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:54.492
OUT?

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.794
SO I THINK THAT IN SOME

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.162
SURVEYING* WELLS SO WHY

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.497
SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ON IS THAT

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.731
WE KIND OF ALREADY ARE.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.300
IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE THE

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:06.170
MONEY FLOWS BECAUSE I THINK

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.471
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:08.072
HOPEFULLY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.173
THAT.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.075
THOSE COSTS DON'T JUST GO AWAY

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.309
IF WE DON'T PROVIDE COVERAGE

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.378
THEY FIND A WAY IT GETS UP TO

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.013
THE GETS COVERED SOME OF THE WAY

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.548
AND MAYBE LESS AND AND A LESS

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:18.883
FUNCTIONAL WHERE IN A WAY THAT

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.017
MAY NOT NECESSARY TREATMENT

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.752
CENTER SO THE RIGHT KIND OF CARE.

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.554
BUT THOSE COST TO MAKE THE WAY

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.856
AROUND AND THEIR OPINION ON THAT.

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:28.292
RATE RATE A AGREE THAT --

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.761
WE ARE ALREADY SPENDING ON CARE

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:31.428
FOR THIS --

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.564
GROUP -- IN

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:35.266
AND HOW WORSE WHERE THOSE

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:39.303
DOLLARS ARE COMING FOR IT FROM

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.604
IS QUITE COMPLICATED.

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:42.039
AND ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF CARE

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.308
THAT'S NEEDED THAT THAT'S NOT

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.442
BEING OBTAINED THEM.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:47.645
BECAUSE OF THE THE ACCESS TO

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.013
CARE THERE'S A LOT OF UNMET AND

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:52.850
RAIL CARE KNEES BUT IN THE END.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:55.119
WHEN THEY FINALLY DO? SIX CHAIR

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.788
OFTENTIMES LATER AND MORRIS THIS

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:58.355
AND MORE EXPENSIVE SETTINGS

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.757
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE ALL DO

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.426
BEAR THE WE VENTURE.

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:03.561
WE'VE ACTUALLY DO THAT THOSE

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.695
COSTS ARE THERE AND HOPEFULLY WE

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:05.830
CAN FIND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.198
DELIVERING THAT CARE TO PRODUCE

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:10.601
BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES.

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.102
OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.237
BEGIN MEASURE THANK YOU ONE

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.071
THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:14.972
SENATOR PANEL LISTEN TO YOUR

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:15.639
QUESTIONS AS WE TALK AS WE TALK

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.074
ABOUT A CHILL AFFECT WE WILL

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.509
HAVE CREATED OUR OWN CHILL

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.778
AFFECT IF WE'VE COVERED.

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.479
ON CHILDREN LAST YEAR AND IF

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.948
THIS ACTION ISN'T TAKEN WILL

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.649
HAVE A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.484
WILL AGE OUT.

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.653
OF AT NINETEEN OF COVERAGE BE

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.722
PROVIDED GO BACK INTO A

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:32.723
SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE NOT

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.058
COVERED SO THAT CREATES A

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:35.292
DIFFERENT KIND OF CHILL EFFECT

OUR ABILITY.

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:47.164
TO GET TRADITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.832
NEED TO FIND OUR MEDICAID

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.368

PUBLIC CHARGE POLICY ALREADY IN

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.308
PLACE IT WAS ACTUALLY

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.043
IMPLEMENTED IN THE EIGHTEEN

00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.877
EIGHTIES RIGHT AROUND THE SAME

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:01.478

WHERE IT CAME FROM. TO THE BUT

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.086
IT ITS RELATIVELY NARROW RIGHT

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.921
NOW -- IT

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.122
APPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.358

AND CERTAIN CASH BENEFITS EARLY

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.740
PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR A

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.508
GREEN CARD OR VISA ARE NOT

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:34.044
ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SERVICES AND

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.679
SO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.281
DIRECTLY AFFECTED UNDER CURRENT

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.985
POLICY IS IS RELATIVELY LIMITED --

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.119
THE IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:44.955
HOMELAND SECURITY THAT'S

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.056
PROPOSING THIS CHANGE.

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.192
THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT IN OCTOBER

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.660
THE COMMENT PERIOD.

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.996
CLOSED IN DECEMBER WAITING TO

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:53.597
SEE IF THEY ISSUE A FINAL RULE --

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.000
IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A CONGRESS

00:43:56.066 --> 00:44:01.005
OF THE A AND THE PROPOSED RULE I

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.306
FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC PROGRAM

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.507
ASPECT OF IT FOR THIS

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:05.642
PRESENTATION BUT IT WOULD

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:08.278
GREATLY EXPANDS THE NUMBER OF

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:09.847
THE CRITERIA.

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:10.948
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:13.050
COULD LOOK AT AND DETERMINING

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:13.817
WHETHER SOMEONE GETS A GREEN

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.887
CARD OR VISA AND IT WOULD COUNT

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:18.255
AGAINST SOMEBODY.

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.823
IF THEY HAVE LOW INCOME IF THEY

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.058
HAD LINKED LIMITED ENGLISH

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:23.360
PROFICIENCY A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.595
FACTORS.

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.030
IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WHETHER

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:27.197
THEY GET THE GREEN CARD SO

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.966
THERE'S A DIRECT A FACT IN TERMS

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:32.202
OF LIMITING IMMIGRATION.

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.471
BUT THE FACT WE'VE BEEN MOST

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:35.839
FOCUS ON IN OUR RESEARCH

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:38.275
SOMETIME FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE IS.

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.444
THE THE BROADER CHILLING EFFECT

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.146
IT COULD HAVE ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:44.214
NOT TESTS MEDI CAL BUT ALSO CAL

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.150
FRESH FOOD STAMPS AND OTHER

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.085
PROGRAMS --

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:50.687
AS YOU KNOW --

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:53.824
WE WE DID SESSION WHICH WAS A

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:55.092
NECESSITY WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:56.493
THE MONEY.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.962
AND AS A RESULT MEDI CAL FEES

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.297
DOCTORS ALBEIT SOME OF BEEN

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.933
INCREASED --

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.868
THE DAILY PART OF YOUR STUDY --

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:07.805
LOOK AT AT THE PRESENT DAY --

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.940
ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR EXISTING

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.742
NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT TAKE

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.143
MEDICARE WHICH IS LIMITED

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.545
BECAUSE OF THE LOWER FEES.

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.013
AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:16.780
WOULD BE --

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:19.783
ADDING THIS POPULATION TO THOSE

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.785
THOSE ROLES ARE ALREADY STRESSED.

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:22.853
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.822
RESEARCH ON MEDI CAL AT ACCESS

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.657
IS NOT MY SPECIFIC AREA OF

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.358
EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF THE

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:31.562
INTERACTIONS WITH THIS POLICY --

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:34.064
AS AS DOCTOR PAN WAS DESCRIBING

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.333
UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE ALREADY

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.634
GETTING SOME OF THE CARE THEY

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:39.169
NEED IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.139
AND I THINK BRINGING THEM INTO.

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:44.007
THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IN A

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:46.743
MORE FORMAL THE PLANNED OUT WAY

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.845
WOULD HELP.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:51.548
THE STATE PLAN. FOR ITS ITS THE

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:53.517
PROVIDER CAPACITY NEEDS AND HELP

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:55.752
TO IT THE BETTER ADDRESSED SOME

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.688
OF THOSE ACCESS ISSUES.

00:45:57.754 --> 00:46:02.259
AND SO AS A PART OF THE YOU OF

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.627
QUANTIFIED DO IT WITH THE COSTS

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.195
ARE GOING TO BE TWO OF IN ROLL

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.698
pPROGRAM.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.732
I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:09.566
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:11.502
ADMINISTRATION ON THE COST NEXT

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.036
OKAY SO -- I

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.238
DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THAT

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:16.573
AND AND THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.741
COULD BE LOST.

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:23.313
AS A RESULT OF OF THAT SO --

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.383
THANK YOU FOR A STATION.

WELL IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES --

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.641
START A REPRIEVE SHAPE THAT

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:53.310
CONTEXT THAT YOU GAVE --

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.279

THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:19.203
THEIR ILLNESS WHAT WHAT REALLY

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:21.271
ENDS UP HAPPENING WHERE WHERE DO

WEIGHT RESPONDING TO THEIR

00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.582
MEDICAL NEEDS.

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.116
WELL TODAY A LOT OF THE CARE

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.685
THAT UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS GET

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.154
IS THROUGH PUBLIC HOSPITALS

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:40.490
THROUGH A PUBLIC CLINICS THROUGH.

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.925
A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS

FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:44.895
CENTERS.

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.096
WHO OFFER CARE TO EVERYONE

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:48.031
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.766
AND OFTEN DO SO ON A SLIDING

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:53.103
SCALE BASIS --

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.940
THE SAN CALIFORNIANS

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:59.243
DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO NON

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:00.978
EMERGENCY SERVICES --

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.846
THROUGH COUNTY PROGRAMS LAKE

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.015
HEALTHY SAN FRANCISCO AND MY

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:06.650
HEALTH LA --

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.318
BUT IT'S A DON'T PROVIDE

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:12.222
INSURANCE BUT OFFER AND CARE AT

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.926
GREATLY REDUCE COSTS OF THEM.

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:17.527
ED BUT THOSE.

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.062
NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS A PROGRAM

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:20.998
LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ARE SOME OF

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:22.466
THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.767
AND A LOT OF THE COUNTIES THAT

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.269
DO OFFER ANY EMERGENT NON

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:27.537
EMERGENCY SERVICES.

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.806
TO UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS OFFER

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:31.975
LIMITED BENEFITS AND THEN THERE

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:32.976
ARE OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:34.645
ENROLLMENT CAPS FOR THEIR

00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:35.912
PROGRAMS SO.

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.848
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GAPS IN

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.616
THE SYSTEM AND IT'S AND IT'S NOT

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:43.186
CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD SO.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.621
RAY IT'S VERY THINKING FRAWLEY'S

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:46.256
DIFFERENT FROM THIS COUNTING YOU

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:49.693
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OKAY --

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.362
AND THEN YOU MENTIONED --

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.998
ONE OF THE REASONS --

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.967
FOR HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.635
UNDOCUMENTED NOT HAVING A

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.871
COVERAGE IS BECAUSE OF NOT

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:02.673
HAVING EMPLOYER COVERAGE

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:05.108
COMPARED TO THE REST OF ALL OUR

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:06.443
COMMUNITIES.

SPEAK FOR ANY SPECIFIC GROUPS

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:24.948

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.668
ON TO THE PROGRAM AND AS I JUST

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.435
AS COSTS.

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:22.038
POTENTIALLY RAMP UP INTO THE OUT

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:26.409
YEARS YOUR FINDINGS --

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.810
FIRST -- WE

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.045
GRAPPLE WITH SOME OF THE SAME

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.013
ISSUES AS SENATOR ROTH IN OUR

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.549
ANALYSIS OF THIS PRESENTS AN

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:34.617
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.619
TO DECIDE AMONG ITS PRIORITIES

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.654
IN TERMS OF DO WE DO WE EXPAND

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.923
COVERAGE TO THE NINETEEN TO

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.557
TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD POPULATION

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:42.125
THERE BY.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.426
YOU KNOW EXTENDING CONTINUOUS

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:47.230
COVERAGE ALL THE WAY FROM --

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.898
ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE AND MAKE IT

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.266
CONSISTENT WITH THE ACA.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.767
VERSES YOU KNOW OTHER

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.569
CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS ELDERLY

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.271
POPULATION HAVING HIGHER HEALTH

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.440
NEEDS AND HAVING HEALTH NEEDS

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.875
THAT MIGHT NOT.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.010
AS OFTEN BE COVERED BY EMERGENCY

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.345
IN RESTRICTED SAID PREGNANCY

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.647
RELATED SERVICES SUCH AS FOR THE

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.149
YOUNG ADULT POPULATION.

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.416
WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.652
THERE BUT JUST A A BRACE SOME OF

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.587
THOSE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION --

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:13.623
SECOND WE DO FIND THAT THE

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.992
INCREMENTAL COST OF INCREASING

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.527
THE SIX PAGER COULD BE SOMEWHAT

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.529
OVERSTATED ONE FOR THE SAME

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.029
REASON --

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.831
THAT -- MISS

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:25.501
CAN'T WELL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.069
DATE PROBABLY NOT OCCURRING

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.804
RIGHT ON JULY FIRST --

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.040
AND THEN THE SECOND IS WHAT WE

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.074
FIND TO BE IN A RONI IS

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.410
ASSUMPTION RELATED TO CASELOAD

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.846
WHICH MAY MAKE THAT MAY MAKE THE

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.681
CASE LOW'S SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED --

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.750
NOT JUST IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.518
TWENTY BUT GOING FORWARD --

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.320
IN OUR VIEW CORRECTING THIS

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.254
ASSUMPTION --

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.656
THIS ARONIE IS AS I'M SURE WE

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.191
THINK WOULD WOULD LOWER COSTS BY

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.959
ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.694
ANNUALLY --

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:53.996
WE ALSO DO RAISE SOME ISSUES ON

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:56.365
THE ON THE PROPOSED RE DIRECTION

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.334
ON OF REALIGNMENT WE'RE

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.769
CONTINUING TO ASSESS THAT AN

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:00.503
ALTERNATE WE WILL RELEASE A

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.537
FUTURE --

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.606
ANALYSIS OF THAT --

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.107
BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.876
INCREASE IN THE REDIRECTION OF

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.611
REALIGNMENT FUNDING IS LIKELY

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.713
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT COUNTY

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.515
COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN BOTH AS

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.217
RESULT OF THE ACA.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.819
AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:20.256
THE INTERVENING YEARS WITH THE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.558
EXPANSION OF CHILDREN'S COVERAGE

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.427
SO UNDER ANY UNDER --

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:27.597
AN EXTRA A FURTHER EXPANSION --

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.198
AND WE'D ALSO NOTE THERE AND

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.833
JUSTIFICATION THAT --

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.868
CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT --

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.136
WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.671
COVERAGE UNDER THAT COUNTY

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:36.939
SERVICES --

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.674
MEDICAL PROGRAM.

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.509
THAT THEY HAD THEY'VE BUILT UP A

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.378
LARGE RESERVE AND I THINK THE

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.480
THE PROPOSED REDIRECTION IS

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.516
ATTEMPTING TO SORT OF MAKE

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.385
FUNDING A LITTLE BIT MORE IN

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.286
LINE.

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.121
WITH THAT WITH WHAT THEIR

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.923
EXISTING BUDGET IS --

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.858
BUT WE DO RIGHT WE WE WOULD

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:56.993
RAISE.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.427
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE AND

01:04:58.494 --> 01:04:59.662
MAGNITUDE OF THAT --

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.497
PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.366
REALIGNMENT RE DIRECTION --

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:04.333
FINDING THAT IT COULD HAVE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.269
IMPACTS ON LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:09.305
ACTIVITIES --

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.107
AND IT THAT IT IT COULD CALL

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.275
FEATURE VIABILITY --

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:17.513
THE SERVICES FOR GIVEN THAT IT

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.515
IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT RECEIVE

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.484
ANY FUNDING WHATSOEVER AND

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.719
REALIGNMENT --

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:25.254
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:26.989
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:27.857
THANK YOU.

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.526
UP I'M GONNA START IF YOU DON'T

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:33.496
MIND CALLING THE DISK A HAVE A

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:34.630
THE TEN THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:36.232
QUESTION YOU KNOW WE WE DID

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:36.899
CHILDREN LAST YEAR NO WARNING.

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.167
EITHER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.635
FINANCES THERE'S ANY THOUGHT

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.071
GIVEN IS THIS KIND OF AN

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.372
INCREMENTAL APPROACH SO WE DID

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.174
KIDS ARE WE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:45.941
THIS.

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:47.510
THE NEXT SEVEN YEAR GAP.

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.512
BECAUSE I'M RECOGNIZING HOW

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:51.213
COMPLEX THIS IS.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.649
IT WE'RE GOING TO REALIGN

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:54.350
REALIGNMENT.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:57.486
RECOGNIZING THE TIME AND AND

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.989
EFFORT AND COST IT TAKES TO

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.992
UPDATE SYSTEMS TO GET READY --

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.027
YOU KNOW.

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.029
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO PERHAPS

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.764
DUE A YEAR PLANNING WHATEVER AND

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.701
TALK ABOUT BRINGING THE ENTIRE

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.436
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION THAT

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.071
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.939
INTO THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM.

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.141
AS OPPOSED TO THE IF.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:22.311
EVERY YEAR SEVEN YEAR GROUP.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.612
THIS PIECEMEAL APPROACH THANK

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:24.647
YOU SENATOR SONG [inaudible]

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.817
IT.

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.086
LAURIE LA THE BERMAN FINANCE SO.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.053
TO ANSWER HE FIRST PART OF THE

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.988
QUESTION REGARDING --

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.256
IF THIS IS JUST AN INCREMENTAL

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.025
APPROACH GOVERNOR HAS STATED%

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:38.027
THAT THE GOAL IS FOR EVERYBODY

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.061
TO HAVE COVERAGE IN THE STATE OF

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.797
CALIFORNIA AND HE DID STATE --

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.966
DAD THIS IS A FIRST STEP OF THIS

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:46.168
IS A DOWN PAYMENT --

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:46.669
WITH.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.204
BRAD BUT CURRENTLY IN THE

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.605
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE PROPOSAL

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:51.774
IS TO BUILD ON SB THIRTY FIVE

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.676
EXPANSION AND CONTINUE COVERAGE

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.345
THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:56.912
TO YOUR SECOND POINT I THINK

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:58.881
THAT IS.

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.983
DISCUSS THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.885
PROCESS ON EXPAND YOU KNOW

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.020
LEGISLATORS PRIORITIES AND

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.689
POTENTIAL EXPANSION TO THE FULL

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.090
POPULATION AND WHAT THE COSTS OF

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:08.657
THAT WOULD BE.

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:10.326
BECAUSE I MEAN JUST PRACTICALLY

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.027
THINKING IN TERMS OF COSTS

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.929
ASSOCIATED WITH IT INCREMENTAL

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.765
APPROACH TO UPDATING SYSTEMS BUT

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.233
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.334
INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.602
EDUCATING THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.404
ABOUT WHO'S COVERED THIS YEAR

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.571
WHO'S GONNA BE COVERED NEXT YEAR

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.573
WHO'S GONNA BE COVERED IN YOUR

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.409
FIVE OR SIX WE HEAR.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.477
THE ISSUES AROUND THE CHILLING

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:33.416
EFFECT OF PUBLIC CHARGES SO MANY --

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.818
CHALLENGES TO ROLLING OUT

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.920
EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITH

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.022
EXPERIENCE AT HISTORICALLY

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:41.157
HEALTHY FAMILIES IT TOOK US.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:42.391
YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES AS LONG AS

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.326
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD IN TERMS OF

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.862
INTRODUCING TO A NEW POPULATION

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.364
A NEW HEALTH PRODUCTS.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.632
AND SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL LEARN

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.067
FROM OUR PAST EXPERIENCES AND

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:53.436
BENEFIT FROM THEM THEY REALLY

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:57.673
THINK ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE --

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.542
TO DO IT AT LEAST IN A BIGGER

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.544
SWAPPED IN SEVEN YEAR INCREMENTS

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.946
SINCE THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.815
FIVE YEAR OLD WHO'LL COME NEXT --

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.716
AND I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND FLIP

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:10.653
IT IT REALLY IS A A QUESTION

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.054
ABOUT [inaudible]

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:12.855
STRATEGICALLY APPROACHING THIS

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.790
EXPANSION.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:16.826
SURE SO JUST TO ADD ON TO WHAT

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.494
MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEPARTMENT OFFINANCE SAID I MEAN CERTAINLY

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:19.428
THERE ARE.

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.095
YOU KNOW WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.831
EFFICIENCIES DOING IF WE WERE

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:22.498
GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS TO

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:24.033
DO THIS AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.434
JUST POINT OUT AND I THINK WE

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:26.902
SHARE THESE COSTS WITH YOUR

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:27.770
STAFF AND CERTAINLY WITH THE LA

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:28.170
SO.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.104
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.439
ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS THE

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:31.740
DOLLARS WERE TALKING ABOUT GET

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.275
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT TEN

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:34.543
TIMES LARGER THAN THE NUMBER

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.212
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:36.879
THAT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT LIKE

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.814
ONE POINT. SIX ONE POINT EIGHT

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.282
BILLION DOLLARS GIVE OR TAKE

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.884
JUST IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.053
THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE COSTS --

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.788
OF ADDITIONAL HSS ON THE CELLS

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:49.458
ARE SIR THAT SORT OF IN THE

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.292
OFFICE THE ARE.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.794
WE ARE NOT ALWAYS SUPER

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:52.561
EFFICIENT AND THE COST OF

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:54.697
ADMINISTRATION BUT WE'RE NOT WE

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:55.664
DON'T COST ONE POINT EIGHT

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:56.332
BILLION TO CHANGE THE HEALTHCARE

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:57.066
SYSTEM.

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.000
I GET THAT BUT BUT BUT BUT WE

01:08:58.067 --> 01:08:59.201
BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:00.469
MORNING IS RECOGNIZING WHAT

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.004
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.506
CURRENTLY RECEIVE A RESTRICTED

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.173
MEDI CAL.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.875
THE I JUST THIS PIECE WOULD BE

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:07.042
BIGGER BECAUSE THE OLDER

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.578
POPULATION THEIR NEEDS ARE.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.447
BROADER AND IT'S BEYOND THE

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.015
SCOPE OF RESTRICTED MEDI CAL SO

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:13.816
I GET THAT.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:14.416
THE ONLY --

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:21.357
HAVE ANY COMMENT ON MY RANT --

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.992
WELL I MERRY REALLY COVER MISS

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.593
CAN'T WILL REALLY COVER DOWN --

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.427
MOST WAS GONNA SAY THE

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:25.961
ADMINISTRATION DID RELEASE

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:26.929
ESTIMATES WHEN WE PUT IT

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:27.563
TOGETHER SO --

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.231
ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.133
TOUCH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED AND

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.068
FIFTY THOUSAND OF UNDER THE

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.170
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES. ONE

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.138
POINT TWO BILLION --

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.907
ART MILLION EXCUSE ME PEOPLE WHO

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.642
COULD GAIN --

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:42.711
COVERAGE UNDER AN EXPANSION --

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.647
TO AND WE FIND THAT THIS WOULD

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:45.981
AND OR AT LEAST THE

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.683
ADMINISTRATION FINDS AND IN US

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.552
AND TRYING TO ADD ASSOCIATE

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.320
COSTS WITH AYE TO ASSESS AND SO

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.221
FORTH.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.455
THIS WOULD RAISE STATE COSTUME

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.223
FOR A BY OVER TWO BILLION

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.858
DOLLARS AND THIS INCLUDES

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.192
EXISTING SPENDING AND THAT

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.193
THAT'S THE INCREMENTAL COST

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.095
ABOVE WHAT WE SPEND ON

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:03.399
RESTRICTED SCOPE SERVICES --

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:03.999
FOR FOR MUCH OF THIS ONE POINT

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.067
TWO POPULAR --

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:07.202
ONE POINT TWO MILLION POPULATION --

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:09.138
A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WHOM ARE

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:12.441
ENROLLED IN CURRENTLY IN

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.742
RESTRICTED SCOPE.

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.211
AND I'LL MAKE ONE LAST --

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.313
POINT THEN I'LL MOVE ON TO

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:20.549
SENATOR ROD --

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:21.116
FIVE CERTAINLY --

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:22.818
I'D FIVE VOTED IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.153
EXPANSION LAST YEAR AND WILL WE

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.088
SUPPORT EXPANSION.

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.056
TO UP TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS I

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:27.856
JUST KNOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND A%

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:31.427
LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY RESOURCES --

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:33.128
TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.964
THOUSAND PEOPLE WHEN THERE IS A

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.132
BROADER POPULATION --

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.802
THAT IF PHILOSOPHICALLY WE ARE

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:42.137
GONNA MAKE A POLICY DECISION TO

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.974
PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE TO THOSE

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.941
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.444
BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.079
THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH IT'S

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:51.747
GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME ENERGY.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.649
FORCE TO DO THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:54.750
THE BROADER CONVERSATION SENATOR

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.518
ROBB.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.354
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR --

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.289
I HAVE TWO AREAS AND LIKE TO ASK

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.824
ABOUT ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE THE

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:02.725
PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.760
UNFORTUNATELY OF RACES EVEN

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.129
THOUGH.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.164
MOST OF US I THINK CERTAINLY I'M

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.232
ONE OF THOSE WOULD LIKE TO COVER

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.867
EVERYONE.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.669
AS A AS A MECHANISM OF TRYING TO

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.604
DRIVE DOWN THE OVERALL COST OF

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.072
HEALTH CARE IN THE END CERTAINLY

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.874
IN CALIFORNIA IF NOT THE UNITED

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:19.575
STATES.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.310
BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT.

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.312
SO THE PUBLIC POLICY DECISION TO

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.848
COVER THOSE NINETEEN TO TWENTY

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:26.415
SIX AS OPPOSED.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.551
TO COVERING THOSE. SIXTY FIVE

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.619
AND OVER ARE THOSE SIXTY YEAR

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.554
OVERI'M LOOKING IN OUR ANALYSIS

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.690
AND IT LOOKS TO ME THAT THE

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.059
OVERALL COST OF THE NINETEEN TO

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:37.926
TWENTY SIX IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:38.894
AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.829
LESS THE BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF THE

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.898
FEDERAL [inaudible]

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:43.999
SHARE VIA.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.234
AND THE COST OF COVERING THE

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.036
SENIORS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:48.404
FIFTEEN MILLION.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.305
BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF THE A

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.440
FEDERAL SURE FOR THE EMERGENCY

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.809
CARE.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.878
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT IN

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.012
LOOKING AT FURTHER EIGHTEEN

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.781
ALICE'S IF WE IN FACT HAVE FORTY

01:11:58.847 --> 01:11:59.648
SEVEN COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.749
PROVIDING SOME.

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.384
ELEMENT.

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.353
OF SAFETY NET SERVICES NOT

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.021
EMERGENCY CARE TO THE

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:08.724
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION --

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.325
AND GIVENWHAT I ANTICIPATE THE

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.528
UTILIZATION RATE OF THE NINETEEN

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.530
TO TWENTY SECURE ROLES TO BE.

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:15.431
THAT WOULD MITIGATE TOWARD

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.399
COVERING.

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:19.268
THE SENIOR POPULATION IF WE HAVE

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.403
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:23.472
COULD SOMEBODY AND I UNDERSTAND

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.074
CONTINUITY OF CARE AND AND DUCT

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.909
PAN A PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.343
ALL THAT BUT COULD SOMEONE.

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.712
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE POLICY

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:30.946
DECISION.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.949
THAT WAS MADE.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.218
SO I JUST WANT AT ONE ONE NOTES

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.687
THOSE COSTS ARE OUR DH CS COSTS

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.522
IN THE IN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.558
WHAT'S NOT REFLECTED THERE ARE

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.126
THE COSTS OF AYE AGES STATUS.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.161
SO I DON'T I I WOULD DEFER TO MY

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.596
SOCIAL ERVICES COLLEAGUES TO

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:48.564
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.365
CORRECT TOTAL FAR TOTAL NUMBERS

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:51.567
BECAUSE THE TWO FIFTY SEVEN AND

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.669
AND ONE FIFTEEN ARE ACCURATE-FROM.

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:54.903
THE DTS SIDE BUT I JUST AS COST

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:55.704
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BEVERY

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:57.039
DIFFERENT SO I JUST I DIDN'T

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:59.441
WANNA HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING OF

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:00.309
WHICH POPULATION MIGHT BE

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.877
CHEAPER I THINK WHEN YOU ADD IN

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:02.911
I JUST AS IT.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:06.682
CHECK IT CHANGES THE TOTALS

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.418
LET'S ASSUME IT'S EQUAL.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:10.185
THAT'S A SUMA LET'S ASSUME A

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:11.053
DOUBLING OF THE COST FOR THE

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.522
SENIOR POPULATION. TO GET IT TO

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.123
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR TWO

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:16.291
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN ONE

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.193
ADDRESS THE POLICY ISSUE AND THE

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.628
DECISION THAT WAS MADE TO COVER

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:22.731
THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX YEAR

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.166
OLDS AS OPPOSED TO THE SENIOR

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.034
POPULATION ANDPROBABLY HAS A

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.903
HIGHER UTILIZATION RATE WITH

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:28.403
MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.371
ARE MUCH.

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.106
A MORE SERIOUS THAN THE

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.342
INVINCIBLE POPULATION.

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.042
THANKS.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.677
DIFFERENT FINANCE THAT I THINK

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.981
THAT'S A REASONABLE --

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.583
NOTE I THINK THAT A WELL TAKEN.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.018
I WOULD SAY THAT THE THAT THE

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.020
POLICY DECISION WAS TO BUILD ON

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.622
THE PREVIOUS EXPANSION LIKE HAS

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.056
PREVIOUSLY BEEN STATED. TO BUILD

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:50.325
ON THE EXPANSION OF THE SB

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:51.560
SEVENTY FIVE SO CURRENTLY --

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:52.795
INDIVIDUALS ARE COVERED THROUGH

WHAT A CONTINUE THROUGH THE AGE

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.100
OF TWENTY FIVE THAT'S THE THE

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.806
THROUGH TWENTY FIVE WE'RE HAPPY

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.274

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.675
THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.110
WELL AND BELIEVE ME I'M NOT

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.267
FINANCE COLLEAGUES CAN TALK

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.568
ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.570
CHANGING WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.272
WITH THE EXPANSION IN.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.807
TWENTY FOURTEEN SO WHAT WE REFER

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.542
TO AS AB --

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.577
EIGHTY FIVE WAS THE INITIAL --

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.211
DETERMINATION OF HOW MUCH MONEY

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:19.081
WE WERE EXCHANGE WITH YOU KNOW

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.349
WITH THE COUNTIES TO PAY FOR CAL

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.950
WORKS BECAUSE OF THAT BROUGHT

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:24.386
EXPANSION THAT HAPPENED IN IN

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:25.988
TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE ACA --

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.990
THE WAY WE ENDED UP DOING THAT

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:28.790
IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.559
PASSED IS THAT COUNTIES WERE

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.327
BROKEN INTO THREE GROUPS.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.596
WE HAD THE CMS P. COUNTIES WHICH

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.531
WERE JUST THE STREET SIXTY FORTY

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:39.034
IN THE INITIAL AB EIGHTY FIVE WE

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:42.271
HAD OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL COUNTIES --

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.672
WHICH WE CALL DOES NEED A PUBLIC

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.807
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THE PEACHES.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.210
LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS --

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.479
AND THEN WE HAD THE REST OF THE

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.947
COUNTIES THAT ARE THAT DON'T

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.181
HAVE YOU MAJOR PUBLIC HOSPITAL

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.217
SYSTEMS WE CALL THEM ARTICLE

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.118
THIRTEEN IS JUST BECAUSE THAT'S

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.085
WHAT IT IS IN THE STATUTE.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.787
WE WE DON'T HAVE FANCY NAMES FOR

01:15:58.854 --> 01:15:59.588
ANYTHING.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.590
SO -- SO FOR

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.625
THE FOR THE NON CMS P.TOWNIES

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.160
BOTH THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.695
AND THE NON PUBLIC HOSPITAL

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.063
SYSTEM COUNTIES THEY HAD A

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.264
CHOICE.

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.599
AS TO WHETHER THEY JUST WERE

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.267
DOING THE SIXTY FORTY SO

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.036
REDIRECTING 60% OF THE

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.305
REALIGNMENT TO FIND CAL WORKS OR

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.773
IF THEY WANTED.

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:22.210
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FORMULA

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.046
METHOD WHICH IT'S COMPLICATED

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.280
BUT THE IDEA THEY'RE BEING THAT

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.282
WE WOULD CALCULATE WHAT WE WOULD

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.650
EXPECT COUNTIES HAVE OTHERWISE

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:29.651
SPENDS.

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.586
IN REALIGNMENTS AND ALL THE

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.188
FUNDING THAT WE THEY GETFROM

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.357
MEDI CAL IN OUR IN OUR WEAVERS.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.160
AND COMPARE THAT TO THEIR COSTS

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.628
THEY WERE SAVING MONEY WE WOULD

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.630
RE DIRECT 80% OF THAT SAVING SO

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:42.864
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FORMULA

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:44.166
THAT WE DO.

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.834
EVERY YEAR --

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.269
AND ALL OF OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.571
COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN THAT

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.474
METHODOLOGY AND THEN I BELIEVE

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.644
FIVE OF OUR I THINK FIVE OTHER

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.479
COUNTIES CHOSE THE FORMULA SO --

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.081
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE RE

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.782
DIRECTION COMES FROM THE FORMULA

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.217
BASED COUNTIES --

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.719
WITH THE SMALLER DOLLARS COMING

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.154
FROM CMS P. AND THE OTHER SIXTY

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.789
FORTY COUNTIES AND THE CHANGES

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.091
THAT THAT.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.126
MISSILE WILL GO OVER --

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.194
ARE REALLY TODAY.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.762
THAT NON FORMULA THE FORMULA

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:14.863
ISN'T CHANGING IT'S REALLY THE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.832
ONES WHERE IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.300
BASED ON COST AND REVENUE IT'S

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:22.104
JUST BASED ON A SPLIT PERCENTAGE

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.741
OF THE REALIGNMENT.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:26.675
RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.510
FINANCE AND SO --

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.479
I GUESS TO GET AT THE THE CHOICE

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.581
THAT WE MADE ABOUT ABOUT WHAT

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:35.217
LEVEL TO REDIRECT --

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.319
AS AS MS CAM WELL AT NOTED

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.321
EARLIER THE GENERAL FUND COSTS

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.023
OF THIS EXPANSION ARE ESTIMATED

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.958
AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.993
MILLION DOLLARS --

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.161
COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:47.362
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING HEALTH

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.431
CARE TO ENGINE --

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.699
POPULATIONS AND SO --

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.534
WE LOOK TO ADD WHAT SORT OF

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.635
ESTIMATE --

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.771
WE WOULD HAVE ON ON WHAT SORT OF

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.738
SAVINGS THAT THEY WOULD

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.273
EXPERIENCE --

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.408
THE SIXTY THREE MILLION

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.076
REPRESENTS LESS THAN A THIRD OF

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.177
THAT TOTAL.

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:03.678
IT SEEM REASONABLE TO US WE'RE

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.047
TALKING WITH COUNTY IS TO LEARN

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:07.649
MORE ABOUT THIS BUT WHEN I THINK

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.017
YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.952
IT BEING LESS THAN A THIRD OF

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:12.387
THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND COST.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:13.789
WE A WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.625
REASONABLE ASSUMPTION IN

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:17.459
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.327
AND BELIEVE ME I AM.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.229
NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS SO I AND I

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.431
HAVE THICK SKIN SO I WOULD

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.232
EXPECT YOU TO CORRECT ME IF MY

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:26.635
UNDERSTANDING IS INCORRECT.

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.837
BUT THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT WAS

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.806
ARRIVED AT AN NEGOTIATED FRANKLY

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:31.840
BY THE COUNTIES IN THE

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:34.609
ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME IN.

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.444
NINETEEN NINETY ONE WAS BASED ON

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.978
KELLY POPULATIONS AT THE TIME

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.447
CASELOADS AND THERE WAS SOME

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.148
OTHER FACTOR THAT I'M CONFESS I

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.917
DON'T REMEMBER.

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:43.585
IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE RIVERSIDE

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:44.953
COUNTY'S POPULATION WAS A

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.488
MILLION OR LESS.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.889
TODAY IT'S ABOUT TO ALMOST TWO

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.724
POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE CASE

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.161
LOADS OF INCREASED.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.297
TO IN A IN A COMMENSURATE WAY.

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.332
THE FUNDING FORMULA THE BASIC

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.034
FORMULA MY UNDERSTANDING FURTHER

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.435
UNDERSTANDING IS HAS NOT BEEN

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:03.004
ADJUSTED SINCE.

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:03.605
NINETEEN NINETY ONE THAT THERE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.241
WAS SOME GROWTH FACTOR IN THE

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.409
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT FLOW TO

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.910
THE COUNTIES.

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:11.613
AND THERE WAS OF OF THE WAY TOO

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.481
FOR DIRECT.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:13.782
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE GROWTH

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.250
FACTOR.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.785
TO THE UNDER FUNDED COUNTIES AND

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.753
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON BUT THAT'S

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.155
BEEN A RATHER SMALL.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.290
INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE FLOW

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.658
OF MONEY THROUGH THE PIPELINE

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.694
AND OF COURSE WHEN WE HAD THE

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.897
HSS SITUATION A FEW YEARS AGO

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:30.132
WAS CHEWED UP --

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:32.167
AND USED.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.635
APPROPRIATELY FOR NECESSARY

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.403
SERVICES FOR THE H. ASSIST

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.171
SERVICES.

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.340
SO BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.174
UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES WHO AND

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:41.543
WHAT I'M HUGE FUNDING DISPARITY

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:42.577
IN THE STATE.

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.112
THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS VERSUS

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.647
THE INLAND AREAS NORTH CENTRAL

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:48.884
AND IN ONE SOUTH.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.886
SO IF YOU'RE CALLING BACK MONEY

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.220
YOU'RE CLAWING BACK MONEY IN

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.289
SOME CASES AT THE UNDER FUNDED

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.490
COUNTY LEVEL.

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:56.525
FROM COUNTIES WHO DON'T HAVE

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.160
VERY MUCH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH TO

01:19:58.226 --> 01:19:59.327
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.763
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.398
SO MY REQUEST IS THIS MILLION

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.034
CONTEMPLATING THIS POLICY --

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.769
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:10.172
CAN ADJUST THE CALLBACK. TO IN

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.507
EFFECT -- DO

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:13.542
WHAT.

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:15.076
POLITICALLY MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:17.179
TO DO IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.413
FORMULA BUT IT JUST.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.081
OF THE MONEY THAT COUNTIES

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.049
PARTICULAR THESE UNDERFUNDED

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:23.618
COUNTIES HAVE. TO PROVIDE BADLY

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.187
NEEDED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:28.223
SERVICES INSTEAD OF APPLYING A

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.025
ONE SIZE FITS ALL CALL BACK. TO

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.326
THE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.094
COUNTIES IN THOSE THAT SOME OF

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.429
US WOULD ARGUE.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.097
ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERFUNDED DOES

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.266
THAT MAKE SENSE.

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.701
SO I JUST WANTED TO SO I WOULD I

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.703
WOULD JUST POINT OUT IN TERMS OF

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.205
THE WAY IT WORKS TODAY --

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.339
SINCE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS THE

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.241
ONE THAT'S BEING MENTIONED THEY

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.076
ARE ONE OF THE FORMULA COUNTIES.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:50.078
SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY IT'S BY

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.580
WHILE THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T A

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:53.448
100% CORRECT FOR THAT IT REALLY

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.116
WAS A LOOK A LOOK AT THE

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.218
REVENUES THEY WERE GETTING

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.586
INCLUDING REALIGNMENT WHICH FOR

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:58.920
THEM YOU KNOW MAY HAVE BEEN

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.222
LOWER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.723
AND THEIR ACTUAL COSTS IN

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:04.693
PROVIDING CARE TO ONLY TAKE BACK

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:06.728
FUNDING. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.496
HAVE MORE REVENUE THAN THEY HAVE

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:09.364
COST.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.765
WE CAN MAKE IT TO THAT WE CAN

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.000
MAKE A DECISION.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.203
AS TO HOW MUCH TO CLUB BACK.

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.438
FROM COUNTIES CAN'T ME RIGHT SO

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.640
IT IS IN STATUTE THE A. B.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.408
EIGHTY FIVE FORMULA THE CHANGES

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.243
THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED WITH

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.178
RESPECT TO THIS AREN'T CHANGING

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:25.480
WHAT RIVERSIDE FORMULA IS.

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.082
IT'S IT'S BECAUSE THEY ALREADY

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.684
PICKED THE FORMULA AND AREN'TA

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:31.052
SIXTY FORTY COUNTY PRESUMABLY

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:32.654
THIS WILL BE A TRAILER BILL

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.489
OFFICE IN THE BUDGET AND RIGHT

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.157
SO WE CAN ADJUST YOU COULD YOU

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.425
COULD ADJUST THE FORMULA THAT'S

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.960
WHAT I'M ASKING THAT SOMEBODY

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.762
TAKE A LOOK AT BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:41.396
FULL.

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:43.965
OF YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I JUST

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.166
THE FORMULA BUT ME A NIGHTMARE.

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.334
I'VE SEEN SOME STATISTICS THAT

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.003
INDICATE FOR EXAMPLE THE BAY

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.404
AREA THE PER CAPITA.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.206
FUNDING FLOW IS ABOUT TWELVE

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:52.574
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CAPITA AND

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:53.742
IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.176
COUNTIES IT'S ABOUT THREE

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:58.947
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.048
PER CAPITA.

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.149
NOW THAT'S A DIFFERENCE.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:01.816
AND IT'S A DIFFERENCE IT IS VERY

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:02.450
DIFFICULT FOR A COUNTY TO MAKE

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:03.685
UP.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:04.452
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.954

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.790
SERVICES.

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:10.091
AND THAT IMPACTS HOW WE DEAL

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.793
WITH HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS AND

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.528
ALL THE REST OF THE STUFF SO IF

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:17.198

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.400

THAT'S FALLS MORE SOCIAL SERVICE

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.385
SIDE SO PERHAPS MORE QUESTION

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.252
FOR FINANCE --

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.222
SO IN TERMS OF THE HSS PORTION --

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:17.992
HOW MUCH ARE WE LOOKING AT --

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.461
FOR FOR THIS POPULATION AND THEN

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.062
IF WE WERE LOOKING BEYOND HOW

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:22.430
FAST WITH THAT GO SO WE'RE

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:25.233
LOOKING AT A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.936
MILLION GENERAL FUND --

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.704
THE FOR FOR THIS --

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:30.705
PROPOSED EXPANSION WHAT

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:33.742
PROPORTION OF THAT'S AYE HSS.

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.677
SUPPORT FOR THE ARM FOR THE FOR

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.246
THE OVER --

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.147
TWENTY SIX POPULATION WE'RE

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.482
STILL WORKING ON THAT WITH THE

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.250
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:43.985
COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE.

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:46.688
REGARDING THE THE PROPOSAL --

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.823
THAT'S BEFORE YOU SO THE FIRST

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.725
YEAR THE COSTS ARE --

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.060
IT'S GOOD THERE'S A BOOK YOU

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.062
KNOW A A DELAY A LAG AND THEN

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:55.597
THERE'S A RAMP UP --

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:57.632
THOSE COSTS WILL GROW OVER TIME

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:58.767
SO I THINK WE'RE ESTIMATING TWO

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.268
POINT TWO MILLION FOR THE FIRST

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:02.137
YEAR -- THEY

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:03.204
WILL GROW --

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:05.740
I THINK WE'RE ESTIMATING LIKE

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.442
TWENTY SIX MILLION OKAY --

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.577
AND THEN KEEPS GOING UP AFTER

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.945
THAT WELL I MEAN SOME POINT THAT

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:12.213
YOU SEE WITH THIS COMES THE

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.748
POPULATION AGED SOURCE DID THE

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.617
WHEN YOU STOP THE RAMP UP PARTS

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:16.584
OF FEW YEARS SO I THINK I'M

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.385
LOOKING AT AND WE'RE STILL

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.119
LOOKING AT THAT.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:23.391
SORT OF LONG TERM WHAT IS OUT

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.359
RANGE OF LIKE.

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.427
IS IT FORTY MILLION

01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:27.629
APPROXIMATELY FORTY TO FORTY

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:28.630
FIVE MILLION OKAY ITSELF

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:31.766
ACTUALLY --

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:35.570
SMALL BUT IT'S CHUNK BUT STILL.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.071
YES SIGNIFICANT CHOCOLATE MODEL

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.140
SIGNIFICAN RIGHT RIGHT AS LARA

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.575
IS THE OTHER SIDE NUMBER THIS IS

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:43.611
THE THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:45.513
RIGHT EXACTLY SO SO I THINK.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.548
SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THINGS

01:24:46.614 --> 01:24:48.116
CERTAINLY WE DEFINITELY WHILE

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.118
LOOK AS WE'RE LOOKING FARTHER

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.419
OUT IS.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.288
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AYE HSS?

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.389
PORTION NOW I WOULD ALSO MAKE

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.758
NOTE THAT --

01:24:56.825 --> 01:25:00.595
LOVED SO USUALLY THINK OF THE

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:01.996
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE OR

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.631
TWENTY SIX THAT'S A AS IT'S ONLY

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:04.632
THREE HEALTHY AND THAT'S TRUE

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:05.800
BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:09.270
CHILDREN WHO HAVE --

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:13.241
CONDITIONS AND DISABILITIES THAT --

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.844
STILL NEED HELP EVEN AFTER EIGHT

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.145
SO I WOULD BE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.713
LOOKING AT THAT.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.949
AS WELL --

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:23.885
NOW IN TERMS OF CCS ANY I GUESS

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.420
EASIEST CUTS OFF AT EIGHTEEN

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.355
ANYWAY BUT I MEAN I'M DISRUPTING

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:29.557
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT FOR

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.492

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:41.503
CONDITIONS.

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.004
EASIER TO GO TO TWENTY ONE SO

01:25:43.071 --> 01:25:44.572
THERE WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.307
EXPANSION --

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.709
AND THAT'S ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.811
COSTS RIGHT THOUGH I THINK THESE

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.346

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.730
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.732
AND CREATED A ELIGIBILITY

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.433
PROCESS IS MUCH SIMPLER LESS

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.136
EIGHT CODES.

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.806
A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS BECAUSE

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:47.408
WE'RE CHALLENGED WITH IN THIS

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.242
CASE.

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:52.246
OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE --

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.515
ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.251
BE DISINCLINED TO WANT.

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.487
TO UP PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THE

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.088
FIRST PLACE SO.

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:02.790
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE

OURSELVES. TO TO REINVENT THE

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:07.195
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.696
AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.998
MAJOR PART OF THIS DECISION.

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.900
THAT'S BEEN MADE BECAUSE I THINK

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:15.970
IT HAS TO BE IF WE'RE MAKING

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:17.271
CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM.

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.974
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS IS IS

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:21.709
CUMBERSOME COMPLICATED.

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:22.643
IS IT --

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.946
CREATES --

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.849
MANY MISTAKES --

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:30.551
THE MORE THE MORE.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.720
CODE IT CODES WHERE PEOPLE WERE

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:34.488
GOING FROM ONE A CODE TO ANOTHER

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:35.323
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.725
IT SEEMS LIKE IF THERE TWENTY

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:38.960
SIX AND THEN THERE.

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.228
TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S JUMPING FROM

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.429
SOMETHING TO SOMETHING --

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.397
IF THEIR INCOME GOES UP AND DOWN

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.099
I MEAN ALL THOSE KINDS OF

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.101
FACTORS --

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.469
IT'S IT'S IT'S TIME THAT WE LOOK

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.037
AT THE CHANGING OF THE

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:52.440
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS SIMPLIFYING

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:53.674
IT MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR THE

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:57.945
CONSUMER CONSUMER FRIENDLY --

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.413
THAT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THIS

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.682
I'M JUST I'M JUST SAYING RIGHT I

01:32:01.749 --> 01:32:03.451

I THINK WE HAVE THERE HAVE BEEN

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.624
MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.260

I THINK IF WE'RE ALSO OF

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.655
STRATEGICALLY WE'RE GOING.

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.189
TO UNIVERSAL.

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:43.524
HEALTH CARE WE SHOULD START

DOING THIS NOW BUILDING THE

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:46.928

TO MY COLLEAGUES AND SENATOR

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.304
ROSS ISSUE ON THE CLOCK BACK YOU

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.205
WERE TALKING SIXTY MILLION

01:32:58.272 --> 01:33:00.508
DOLLARS OUR HAND OUT ON PAGE SIX

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.476
SHOWS THAT SOME ELEVEN COUNTIES

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:03.277
ARE NOT.

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:06.280
PROVIDING ANY NON EMERGENCY CARE

01:33:06.347 --> 01:33:09.050
RIGHT NOW FOR A FRIEND DOCUMENTS

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:10.952
WHAT IS WRONG WHICH IS LETTING

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.219
THEM HALF THE MONEY.

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:14.155
IN SAYING YOU PROVIDING THE CARE

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:16.357
NOW.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.592
WHY WOULD WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.027
POSSIBLY COULD THE COUNTY

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.862
HOSPITALS?

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:22.463
TO THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:23.731
IT WOULDN'T BE PROVIDING

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:25.900
SERVICES TO THE POPULATION AT

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.101
THE SERVER IF WE JUST LET THEM

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:30.905
KEEP MONEY.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:33.174
BUT BUT THERE'S A THERE'S ELEVEN

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:33.808
THAT DON'T AND SOME OF THEM ARE

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:35.209
BY PROVIDING SOME SAFETY NET

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.411
WOODEN THE ON THE NATURAL WOULD

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:40.748
NEED JUST PROVIDE MORE SERVICES.

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:44.685
THEY HAD MORE MONEY.

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.254
AND TRY TO WANT TO BE SO NAIVE.

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:48.422
NO -- THANK

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:49.724
YOU SENATOR --

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.626
WELL I I I I AGAIN THE PROPOSAL.

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:54.161
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION REFLECTS

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:55.396
THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING ON THAT

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:56.564
RESPONSIBILITY AND I I

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.133
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT --

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.737
BUT FOR ON THE RESPONSIBILITY WE

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:03.671
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO MAKE

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:09.610
THE ADJUSTMENT.

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:10.578
AND I CAN JUST JUMP IN I MEAN I

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:11.779
THINK THAT --

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.080
CERTAINLY WE KNOW OUR COUNTY

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.615
PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS DO

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.317
PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.285
CARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO THAT

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.920
TO WHOEVER REMAINS UNINSURED.

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.055
I THINK --

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:23.190
THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.792
MORE FUNDING IN TOTAL THAT THEY

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:25.659
WOULD BE GETTING THROUGH AN

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:27.361
EXPANSION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.796
THOSE SERVICES AND PROVIDE THEM

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.264
ANYMORE MANAGED WAY.

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:31.565
AND HAVING INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:33.501
ACCESS TO OTHER SERVICES THAT

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:34.368
PERHAPS THEY DON'T HAVE IN THE

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:36.070
COUNTIES TODAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:37.571
AS YOU KNOW COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.106
VERY VARIED ACROSS THE STATE

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:40.174
WITH SOME HAVING.

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.709
SIGNIFICANT OUTPATIENT PRIMARY

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:43.544
CARE AND OTHERS BEING MORE --

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.279
CONSTRAINT ON THAT SIDE SO WE

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.647
VIEW IT AS A BENEFIT TO THE

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.115
PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO DO

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:49.650
THIS EXPANSION --

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:51.352
YES THERE IS MONEY COMING OUT IN

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:34.215
AND THEN WE GO FROM NINETEEN TO

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:35.282
TWENTY SIX ARE WE GONNA DO THIS

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.618

SOMEONE MENTIONED WE'RE BUILDING

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.393

YOU KNOW THE THE NUMBER IS SO

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.871
MUCH SMALLER THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:37:57.938 --> 01:38:00.541
COVER SO --

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:02.476
I WOULD RATHER THAT ARE

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.144
RATIONALE BE BASED ON WE'RE

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.279
MOVING.

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.480
IN THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I MEAN

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.757
THERE'S BEEN.

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.192
REALLY.

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:20.194
BIG DEBATES AS I UNDERSTAND IT I

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:21.462
WAS IN HERE.

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:25.466
BUT WE ALL SAID OR ALL OF

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:27.968
EVERYBODY UP HERE SAID WE WANT

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:30.337
COVERAGE FOR EVERYBODY.

PLEASE.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.245

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:40.180
GET TO WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:45.719
BE WHICH IS EVERYBODY COVERED.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:46.887
LARA ALLIED DEPARTMENT OF

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:49.023
FINANCE -- I

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:50.257
THINK YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:53.260
AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY.

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.495
LIKE THE GOVERNOR HAS SEATED

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:57.064
AIDS IT IS THE FIRST PREVIOUSLY

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.667
NOTED THAT COST TO BUILD ON SB

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.835
THIRTY FIVE IS POPULATION --

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:03.837
IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:04.905
MILLION FOR MEDI CAL BENEFIT

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:08.008
COSTS WHEREAS EXPANDING THROUGH

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:10.844
THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR AND ABOVE

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:13.047
IS A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.748
GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR MEANT FOR

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.350
JUST FOR MEDI CAL NINE NOT

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.452
INCLUDING I JUST AS COSTS SO.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:21.021
I THINK IT'S A BOTH --

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.856
BUILDING ON SB SEVENTY FIVE IT'S

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:24.291
CONSISTENT WITH THE COVERAGE

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:26.126
THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY GET YOU

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:27.995
KNOW THE AND AS REQUIRED THROUGH

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:30.831
THE ACA THROUGH THE AGE OF

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.566
TWENTY FIVE BUT ALSO THERE'S A

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.001
SIGNIFICANT --

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:36.437
FISCAL DECISION THAT THAT WAS

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:37.504
MADE.

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.039
DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER AS TO WHAT

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:41.308
IT WOULD COST TO COVER EVERYONE.

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:43.310
IN THE STATE TO ELIMINATE THE

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.978
UNINSURED THAT.

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:46.814
EVERYBODY OR JUST AND DOCUMENTAL

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.448
HAVE FOR EVERYBODY TO REDUCE THE

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:50.617
ANYBODY NOW NOT FOR EVERYBODY --

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:53.921
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT.

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.756
I HAVE WE WERE MORE IN THE WORKS

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:57.057
OF PUTTING TOGETHER AN ESTIMATE

01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:58.492
LOOKING AT THE MEDI CAL AND I

01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:01.061
HSS COSTS FROM THE UNDOCUMENTED --

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.730
BUT YOU KNOW COVERING EVERYBODY

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:03.831
WOULD BE KIND OF OUTSIDE THE

01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:05.699
SCOPE OF DH CS AT THIS HEARING

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:06.400
TODAY.

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.935
FROM I ADD ON TO WHAT MY

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:10.037
COLLEAGUE SAID A MOMENT AGO --

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:11.372
YEAH I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S MADE

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.474
IT CLEAR THAT HE HAS A GOAL TO

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.943
COVER ALL OF THESE FOLKS AND SO.

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:16.977
YOU KNOW.

01:40:17.044 --> 01:40:20.047
I WOULD OFFER THAT --

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:22.950
GIVEN THE THE THE CAR --

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:24.518
AND AGAIN WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:25.853
WITH YOU ON THE AYE HSS

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:29.223
COMPONENT OF THAT BUT AS AS

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:30.891
MERRY DESCRIBED EARLIER --

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.993
SOMETHING LIKE ONE POINT SEVEN

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.228
ONE POINT.

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.662
EIGHT BILLION FOR JUST THE MEDI

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:37.564
CAL PART OF THAT --

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.799
THAT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFICULT

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.634
COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE IN ONE YEAR

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.536
AND UNDER THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IT

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:43.971
WOULD PROBABLY MEAN HAVING TO DO

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.406
PULL BACK ON SOMETHING.

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.640
ELSE.

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.275
THIS WAS THE RIGHT MIX FOR THE

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.110
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:51.578
STANDPOINT I WOULD ALSO ADD --

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:54.515
THIS BUDGET DOES QUITE A BIT --

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:55.749
REGARDING --

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:57.084
YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.819
PENSION PAYMENTS AND CLEANING UP

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:00.287
BUDGETARY DEBT THAT'S GOING TO

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:02.356
READ THAT'S GOING TO BE REVEALED.

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:03.690
REAL SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:05.125
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.360
THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.128
CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS LIKE

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:11.532
THIS -- SO.

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:13.200

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:22.469
NINETY FOUR MILLION TO THE

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:24.271
GENERAL FUND --

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:25.439
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY --

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:27.674
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S GONNA

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:29.576
BE 1100% --

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:31.545
STATE -- BUT

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:33.180
HAD WE USE THAT MONEY FOR

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.047
ENHANCEMENT OF THESE OTHER

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.916
SERVICES OF WHAT KIND OF FEDERAL

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:38.285
FUNDS ARE WE LEAVING OFF THE

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:40.854
TABLE.

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:42.422
SO OBVIOUSLY I WOULD NEVER DARE

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.557
TO SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR BUT

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:44.858
I'LL TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THE

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:46.560
PIECES I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.362
IT AS AS OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:49.563
COLLEAGUES SAID THERE HAD TO BE

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:50.998
CHOICES MADE IN SORT OF WHAT WAS

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:52.366
BEING DONE --

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:53.867
SO WHILE WE WHILE THE GOVERNOR

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:55.669
DID NOT SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED TO

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:57.471
RESTORE BENEFITS OR TO UNDO THE

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.739
CUTS THAT STILL REMAIN ALTHOUGH

01:42:58.805 --> 01:42:59.907
NOT ALL OF THEM DO YOU.

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:01.041
THERE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:02.743
THE PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY THAT'S

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:03.944
GOING TO INCREASED PROVIDER

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.746
RATES SO IT'S NOT A DIRECT

01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:07.314
UNDOING OF THE CUTS BUT IT'S A A

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:08.382
SEPARATE WAY OF PROVIDING

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:11.251
FUNDING AND INCREASE THAT AMOUNT --

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:14.087
BY A FEW HUNDRED MILLION IN PROP

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:14.988
FIFTY SIX MONEY FOR THIS

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:17.457
UPCOMING YEAR --

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:20.427
AS YOUR SECOND QUESTION THAT

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.895
WE'VE DONE THAT ANALYSIS I DON'T

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.463
KNOW THAT HOW.

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.098
EASY THAT ANNOUNCES WOULD BE --

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.733
I WOULD SAY THAT WE DO GET

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.235
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THIS

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:30.203
POPULATION BECAUSE WE STILL

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.039
CONTINUE TO CLAIM. FOR THE

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:33.774
LIMITED SCOPE SERVICES SO THAT'S

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.842
WHY OUR TOTAL FUND IS TWO FIFTY

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:37.077
SEVEN BUT OUR GENERAL FUND IS

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:37.611
ONE NINETY FOUR SO WE ARE

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:39.046
GETTING ABOUT SIXTY FOUR MILLION

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.647
IN FEDERAL FUNDS --

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:43.584
SO YES IF THIS WAS FOR FULL YOU

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.085
KNOW FULLY FEDERALLY ELIGIBLE

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:46.320
FOLKS IT WOULD --

01:43:46.386 --> 01:43:47.354
DRAWDOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:50.090
MONEY BUT IT WOULD BE GOING FROM

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:50.891
ZERO TO SOMETHING IT WOULD BE

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:51.892
GOING FROM SIXTY FOUR TO

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:54.027
PROBABLY LIKE A HUNDRED AND

01:43:54.094 --> 01:43:55.195
TWENTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:57.631
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OAK DON'T

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.666
LIKE QUOTE ME ON THE HUNDRED AND

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:01.735
THEN FINALLY --

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:05.405
WE HAVE A A WAIVER WITH THE

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.473
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.175
EXPIRING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:09.543
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THE

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.678
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AND

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:13.614
NEGOTIATE --

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.581
HOW WE'RE GOING?

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:16.183
TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES WITH

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:17.384
FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE FUTURE.

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:20.587
ASSUMING THAT THIS --

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:21.121
THIS.

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:24.625
IDEA OF SERVICES BETWEEN

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:25.792
NINETEEN AND TWENTY SIX AND I

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.494
SHARE THE CONCERNS.

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:30.597
OF THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:31.465
AND MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:33.567
RIVERSIDE --

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:34.334
THAT.

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.302
THE NEED IS PROBABLY MUCH

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:38.939
GREATER THE SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLDS

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:41.141
TO OVER --

01:44:41.208 --> 01:44:43.644
AM AM PROBABLY --

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:46.513
ACCESS OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS AND I

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.081
HAVE A HAVE A COSTS IT IS SAID

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.383
THAT THAT IS RATHER SIGNIFICANT

01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:51.718
BUT EMBRACING WHATEVER PROGRAM

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.053
WE ULTIMATELY EMBRACE IS

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.255
PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:56.556
DRAW MORE.

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:57.824
UNDOCUMENTED AGREEMENT

01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:59.559
IMMIGRANTS TO THE PROGRAM DO YOU

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:01.662
SEE THIS IN ANYWAY JEOPARDIZING

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:03.630
OUR ABILITY TO GO --

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:06.266
EIGHT UP IN A POSITIVE WAY --

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.401
FOR THE STATE --

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:08.535
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:09.870
AND THAT'S A HARD QUESTION TO TO

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:10.871
ANSWER I MEAN CERTAINLY

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:12.406
CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN MUCH

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:14.408
MORE EXPANSIVE --

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:15.842
IN OUR COVERAGE WE'VE WE'VE

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.277
CURRENTLY PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:18.879
TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE NOT

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:21.348
ELIGIBLE FOR A FEDERALLY COVERED

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:23.316
WHO ARE DOCUMENTED CITIZENS --

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:24.251
OBVIOUSLY THAT SHOT THE CHILDREN

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:25.752
EXPANSION THAT WE DID LAST YEAR

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:27.454
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY SPECIFIC.

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:30.357
CONCERNS OR ISSUES --

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:30.857
AS LONG AS WORK YOU KNOW

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:33.960
APPROPRIATELY A HUGE STATEMENT

01:45:34.027 --> 01:45:35.262
ON WHAT --

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:36.563
WE DO WITH OUR STATE FUNDS

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.798
CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF THE WE

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.900
WERE EXPIRING NEXT YEAR IS ONE

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:42.035
THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT --

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.170
I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.304
IN SOME STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IN

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.506
TERMS OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF A

01:45:46.573 --> 01:45:47.507
WILL PROBABLY NEED TO ASK FOR

01:45:47.574 --> 01:45:48.542
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:50.010
ACTUAL WEAVER SIDE WILL PROBABLY

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.445
BE DECREASED.

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:53.380
AND WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.549
USE SORT OF LESS SUBJECTIVE

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:56.850
AUTHORITIES FROM THE FEDERAL

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.251
SIDE TO IT.

01:45:58.318 --> 01:45:58.919
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.320
MAINTAINING ALL THE MONEY SO WE

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.221
ARE THINKING THROUGH FOR ALL OF

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:01.988
THOSE.

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:03.657
IMPACTS --

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:05.225
BUT YEAH THAT THERE HAS NOT CMS

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.693
IS NOT RAISE ANY PARTICULAR

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.361
ISSUES TO US ABOUT --

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:10.363
OUR PRIOR EXPANSIONS OR THEY ARE

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:11.732
ALSO AWARE OF THIS PROPOSED

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:12.966
EXPANSION AS LONG AS WERE.

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:14.267
DOCUMENTING APPROPRIATELY THE

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:15.335
JUST THE FEDERAL FUNDS PIECE

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:16.470
THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:17.738
CAN YOU EDUCATE ME EVEN FORGIVE

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.206
MY IGNORANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:46:19.272 --> 01:46:20.440
NEXUS BETWEEN.

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.109
EXPANDING --

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:23.510
MEDICAL COVERAGE TO A DOCUMENT

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:29.282
AS AND THE THE NEXUS TO AYE HSS

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:31.251
COVERAGE UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:32.152
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT AYE HSS

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:32.886
IS A IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:33.653
PROGRAM --

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.088
BUT IT BUT IS THERE IF WE IF WE

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.556
OFFER -- ON

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:39.126
DOCKS --

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:41.294
FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE ORDER WITH

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.663
MEDI CAL COVERAGE DOESN'T HAVE

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.799
TO COME ALL OR NOTHING WITH HSS

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:47.200
EVEN THE STATE'S BACK FILLING IT.

01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:48.401
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:49.402
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE RED

01:46:49.469 --> 01:46:50.937
FLAGS HERE TODAY SUCH AS A VERY

01:46:51.004 --> 01:46:52.639
EXPENSIVE PROGRAM --

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.674
CAN CAN WE OFFER ONE WITHOUT THE

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:55.642
OTHER -- IS

01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:58.211
A WAY TO I'M SORRY INCREMENTALLY

01:46:58.278 --> 01:46:59.746
GET TO WHERE --

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:01.648
THIS THE LEGISLATURE ONCE AGO

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:02.716
SURE CERTAINLY SO THERE WOULD

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:04.684
NOT BE A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.052
EXTEND NAY TO ASSESS --

01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:07.287
TO THIS POPULATION SINCE IT'S

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:08.021
NOT A FEDERALLY REQUIRED

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:09.589
POPULATION SO THAT WOULD BE A

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:10.857
DECISION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.459
AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE MAKING

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:13.693
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.028
THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.196
WHICH IS WHEN WE HAVE EXPANDED

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:17.697
FULL SCOPE COVERAGE WE GIVE

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.566
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE FULL SCOPE.

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:20.934
OF ALL OF THE BENEFITS WHICH IS

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:22.102
INCLUSIVE OF AYE TO ASSESS AND

01:47:22.169 --> 01:47:23.703
MANY OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.038
THAT'S NOT REQUIRED FOR MANY

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:26.540
FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE IT IS A

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.507
STATE DECISION.

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:28.842
AND YOU HAVE --

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:29.876
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT TODAY I

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:30.877
WOULD LIKE TO GET THE COST OF

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:32.212
WITH THE I. JUSTICE COSTS WOULD

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.180
BE.

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.382
FOR THE THE ELDERLY POPULATION

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:37.117
THAT SEEMS TO BE --

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:39.119
COST PROHIBITIVE IN IN THE EYES

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:40.220
OF WHAT I'M HEARING HERE TODAY

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.154
IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:42.189
SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT FINDS

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:43.456
ARE WORKING ON THAT AND SO

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:44.224
CERTAINLY WILL GET BACK TO YOU

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:45.592
RETREAT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:47.093

BRIEFLY --

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:51.598
SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.166
HOUSES A BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:54.734
BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:57.604
COMPONENTS FOR A SPECIAL.

01:47:57.671 --> 01:48:03.243
THAT.

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:05.545
I THINK WITH THIS AGE GROUP.

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:08.481
FOR WE'LL DO OUR OUR SIDE I

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:10.016
THINK AS YOU KNOW WE DO SORT OF

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.852
PM OVERALL PM PM'S AND SO WE'LL

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.186
PROBABLY HAVETO MAKE SOME

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:13.920
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PERCENTAGES

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.856
BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THE BEST

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:17.490
THAT WE CAN THEN OBVIOUSLY I TO

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:17.991
SAYS IS BEING CALCULATED

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.093
SEPARATELY [inaudible]

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.828
THE WRONG.

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.296
ME JUST ASK ONE QUICK QUESTION

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:24.998
ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING THE

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:26.466
PREMISE BEHIND THE AGES SAYS

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:27.434
PROGRAM IS.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.469
YOU KEEP PEOPLE HOME FOR EXAMPLE

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:30.871
WHEN YOU KEEP THEM OUT OF HIGH

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.205
COST INSTITUTIONS.

01:48:32.272 --> 01:48:33.807
YOU YOU I ASSUME YOU HAVE TO

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:35.609
BUILD IN SOME COST SAVINGS

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:38.111
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISS HSS

01:48:38.178 --> 01:48:39.179
PROGRAM.

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:39.980
AN ADDITION TO JUST WHAT THE

01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:41.781
BILL IS RIGHT DOESN'T IT IMPACT

01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:42.616
YOUR OVERALL.

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:44.651
MEDI CAL.

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.887
COST IF YOU DON'T HAVE A AGES

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:47.921
SAYS AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:50.357
INSTITUTIONS.

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:51.958
SO I JUST I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.793
I'M UNDERSTANDING SO IF IF WE

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.095
WERE YOU KNOW TAKING THE PATH

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:56.663
THAT THAT SENATOR STONE WAS.

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.999
DISCUSSING WHETHER THE COST ON

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.467
THE MEDICARE ON THE NON ART IS

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.035
ASIDE WE NEED TO INCREASE TO

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.370
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT I JUST

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:04.671
AS WASN'T KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:05.805
NURSING SOI THAT IS A FAIR

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:06.706
QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE'VE

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:08.074
EVER WE'VE NEVER LOOKED AT IT BY

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:08.942
ABOUT.

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:09.976
SORT OF DIVIDING UP THE BENEFITS

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:11.811
THAT WE WE WOULD HAVE TO COME UP

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:12.846
WITH A METHODOLOGY BUT I THINK

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.080
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THAT WE

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.282
WOULD NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:16.416
I THINK THAT'S TRUE OF ANY

01:49:16.483 --> 01:49:17.984
BENEFIT RIGHT I MEAN I THINK. TO

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.286
THE DEGREE WE MAKE.

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.820
DECISIONS ON CERTAIN BENEFITS IT

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:22.756
COULD AFFECT THE OVERALL COST

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:24.190
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY EVEN

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:25.325
THOUGH WE DO.

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:27.193
HELP FUND THE AGES HAS SAID OF

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.930
THE CAL THE FEDERAL SIDE

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.698
NOBODY'S RECOGNIZE THE SAVINGS

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:33.733
AND WE DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THE

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.569
SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CORRECT.

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.104
CREW TO THE FEDERAL.

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:40.707
MEDICARE MEDICAID PROGRAM YEAH I

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:42.809
MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE THE

01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:44.377
CHALLENGES IN THE WAY THAT SOME

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:46.012
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WORKS ON

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:47.580
EXPANDING FULL SCOPE TO THOSE

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:48.481
WHO HAVE.

WE GET SOME PORTION OF FEDERAL

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.518

01:49:51.584 --> 01:49:53.687
DEPARTMENT SIDE WE DO THAT BASED

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:57.123
ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS SO WE WENT

01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:57.424

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:03.897
LIKE 45% OF THE COST WOULD

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.365
OTHERWISE BE EMERGENCY COSTS

01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:07.687
PROBLEMS WITH --

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.789
ESSENTIALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUT

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:32.378
PROBLEM.

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:34.781
IN IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH THE

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:38.384
THE WAIVER THE I AM THE ISSUE.

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.586
TO REQUEST THE FEDERAL

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:41.154
GOVERNMENT ARE IS THE DEPARTMENT

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:44.324
TO MAKE SOME EFFORT TO ALLOW

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:48.761
CALIFORNIA [inaudible] TO BE

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:51.464
EXCLUDED FROM THAT LAW AND AND

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:54.334
PROCEED WITH --

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.970
THAT ISSUE SO WE CAN HAVE THESE --

01:52:57.036 --> 01:53:00.440

OF IN CALIFORNIA.

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.110
YES SO --

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:05.011
STATUS OF THE ON SHORE SO WE

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.279
OBVIOUSLY DO YOU ALREADY HAVE

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:07.981
THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBURBS

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.382
USES SIDE WE'VE BEEN HAD WE'VE

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:10.483
HAD THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:11.317
THE WAIVER.

01:53:11.384 --> 01:53:12.819
THINK THIS IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY

01:53:12.886 --> 01:53:14.020
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.655
THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE --

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:17.023
IS A PART OF OUR OVERALL

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.691
PLANNING AS WE LOOK AT OUR

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:20.660
WEAVERVILLE NOT ONLY ARE ELEVEN

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:21.861
FIFTEEN WAIVER --

01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:22.962
BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH

01:53:23.029 --> 01:53:24.764
WAIVERS IS ALSO EXPIRING NEXT

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.666
YEAR AND SO IT THAT'S A PART OF

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:28.067
THAT THAT WHOLE PROCESS THAT

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:28.868
WILL BE STARTING --

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:30.470
SOME STAKEHOLDER WORK IN THE

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:31.738
FALL IN TERMS OF WHAT THINGS

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.107
NEED TO BE INCLUDED HOW WOULD-THEY BE FUNDED.

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:35.575
OBVIOUSLY JUST LIKE WITH THE

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:37.944
SEVENS USE DISORDER --

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.679
WAIVER YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:40.980
THAT THEN COUNTIES OFTEN TO YOU

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:42.715
SINCE COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:53:42.782 --> 01:53:44.150
FOR THE FUNDING SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:45.418
ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RIGHT

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:46.986
EVEN ON THE SENTENCE YOU SIDE.

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:50.290
SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER THING TO

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:53.159
ADD TO KEEP IN WE PAY FOR MENTAL

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:54.260
HEALTH SERVICES IT WOULD REALLY

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:55.361
NEED TO BE ALSO BE A COUNTY

01:53:55.428 --> 01:53:59.098
DECISION TO WANT TO PROVIDE THAT --

01:53:59.165 --> 01:53:59.766
I AM CERTAIN THERE PROBABLY SOME

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:00.667
THAT WOULD --

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:03.803
THE CITY --

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:05.939
YEAH WELL JETER THE PRISONS YOUR

01:54:06.005 --> 01:54:07.941
ARM ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:09.108
MANAGER AND SKINNER --

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:11.744
WE WERE LIKE.

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.213
KIND OF TAKEN ABACK WITH THE

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:16.249
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE.

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:18.418
AND WE AND AND NO INCREASE IN

01:54:18.484 --> 01:54:19.819
THE POPULATION.

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.822
SO I THINK SOME OF US OUT SO WHY

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:23.990
IS THAT HAPPENING.

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:26.359
WELLS BECAUSE OF FORTY FIVE

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.294
HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE.

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.201
IN THE STATE PRISON.

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:37.170
IN THE COSTS OF HEALTHCARE IN

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.738
THE STATE PRISON IS GONE UP WE

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.373
NOW SPEND NINETY THOUSAND

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:40.974
DOLLARS PER INMATE.

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:41.741
NOW [inaudible]

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:47.780
I I THINK THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:50.583
SAVING MONEY.

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:54.153
IF YOU ADD IN THE COUNTY'S JAIL.

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.189
LIKE WHAT LOS ANGELES DOING IS

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:58.758
IS FISCALLY CORRECT TO DO.

01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:01.194
THIS TO GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:03.663

THERAPEUTIC HEALTH CARE FACILITY.

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:13.006
AND I THINK A. WE AT THE STATE

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:15.541
NEED TO THINK THE SAME WAY.

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:17.277
AS THEY WERE DOING WITH OUR

01:55:17.343 --> 01:55:19.712

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:23.583
WAIVER.

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.551

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:32.325
CORRECT.

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:33.893
UNION AMERICA BECAUSE THE STATE

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:35.187
I ALSO WANT TO PUT A FINER POINT

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:38.124
ON OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:40.626
RESTRICTED SCOPE WE TALK ABOUT

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:42.228
SORT OF BLISSFULLY THAT YOU GET

02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:43.696
A BURKE CHEN C. OLY CARE BUT

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:45.364
YOU DON'T CARE PRIMARY

02:01:45.431 --> 02:01:47.700
PREVENTIVE CARE LET ME.

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:50.136
IN SPLITS THOSE AMONG YOU WHO

02:01:50.202 --> 02:01:52.805
HAVE WORKED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:55.074
UNDOCUMENTED NO OR UNINSURED FOR

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.442
ANY REASON.

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:58.010
KNOW THE REALITY OF LIVING

02:01:58.077 --> 02:02:00.012
SICKER DYING YOUNGER AND BEING

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:02.081
ONE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT AWAY

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.616
FROM BANKRUPTCY.

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:05.918
IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA YOU DON'T GET

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:07.553
THE MEDICATION TO CONTROL YOUR

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:09.689
ASTHMA WHEN YOUR ASTHMA IS SO

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.657
BAD YOU'RE ENDANGERING YOUR LIFE

02:02:11.724 --> 02:02:13.325
YOU WILL GET A TREATMENT IN THE

02:02:13.392 --> 02:02:15.428
EMERGENCY ROOM BUT SHE WON'T GET

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.862
ONGOING MEDICATIONS.

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:23.836
THE FAMILY WHO WERE THE ONGOING

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:25.371
DOCTOR VISITS THE TESTS.

02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:27.106
AT ONE POINT TO ONE OF OUR

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:28.941
COUNTIES IN IN CALIFORNIA THE

02:02:29.008 --> 02:02:31.844
DIABETES MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WAS

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.479
THAT THE HEALTH DIRECTOR.

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:36.148
VISITED THE PEOPLE WHO HAD

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:37.550
AMPUTATIONS.

02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:39.151
K. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:41.454
DIABETES ISN'T ISN'T MANAGE TO

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:43.556
HAVE AMPUTATIONS THERE ARE ANY

02:02:43.622 --> 02:02:46.692
NUMBER OF ACADEMIC STUDIES ABOUT.

02:02:46.759 --> 02:02:48.728
DIABETES AND THE UNINSURED

02:02:48.794 --> 02:02:50.296
HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT SHOW THE

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:53.165
RATE OF AMPUTATIONS ARE HIGHER

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:53.699
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:54.667
COVERAGE.

02:02:54.734 --> 02:02:57.336
IT'S ALSO THE RATE OF BLINDNESS

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:59.472
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:01.273
NEEDING CARE.

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.608
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT KEEPING

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.376
PEOPLE OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:05.811
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THEM.

02:03:05.878 --> 02:03:07.747
IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING

02:03:07.813 --> 02:03:10.549
CONTRIBUTING PAYING THEIR TAXES

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:12.418
BEING PART OF THEIR FAMILIES.

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:14.120
THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.488
CANCER.

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:17.923
AN AUNT WHO HAD BREAST CANCERS

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:19.725
CHILD STOLE TO THE SOLUTION THE

02:03:19.792 --> 02:03:22.194
CARE SHE RECEIVED WAS WHEN SHE

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:24.497
SCREAMED LOUDLY ENOUGH THAT THE

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.265
NEIGHBORS CALLED THE COPS.

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:27.399
THEY TOOK HER TO COTTAGE

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:28.934
HOSPITAL IN SANTA BARBARA WITH

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:30.669
THE FOR PAIN MEDS SHE WASN'T

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:32.938
SCREENED SHE WASN'T TREATED SHE

02:03:33.005 --> 02:03:35.307
WASN'T PROVIDED ANY OTHER CARE

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:36.876
MY GRANDFATHER SPEND HIT.

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.778
HER LAST YEAR'S CARING FOR HOME

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:40.679
THOSE ARE THE REALITIES OF BEING

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:43.449
UNINSURED SO WE SORT OF PASS

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.384
OVERWRITTEN TALK ABOUT PRIDE

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:46.652
PEOPLE DON'T GET PRIMARY

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.053
PREVENTIVE CARE.

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.422
I WANTED TO PUT A SHARPER POINT

02:03:50.489 --> 02:03:52.625
FOR ON IT FOR YOU ISSUE MAKES

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:55.327
THIS THESE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO'S

02:03:55.394 --> 02:03:56.629
GOING TO GET HERE.

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:57.830
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET

02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.565
COVERAGE WHEN IT'S GOING TO

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:01.534
HAPPEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.102
HEALTH FOR ALL FOR MORE THAN

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.570
FIVE YEARS NOW?

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:06.272
WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE'VE MADE SOME

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:08.274
PROGRESS WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.911
THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE'S COMMITTED

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:12.678
TO ALL.

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:13.512
BUT SOMETIMES WE GET A LITTLE

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:14.313
IMPATIENT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:15.948
REAL PEOPLE --

02:04:16.015 --> 02:04:18.217
FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.852
REALIGNMENT.

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.287
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:22.588
TAKE A THIRD OF THE MONEY BUT

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:24.323
THE ONLY PROPOSED COVER 10% OF

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.025
THE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO

02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:28.260
THINK ABOUT THAT --

02:04:28.327 --> 02:04:29.762
YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT TO THINK

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:30.596
ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:32.665
COUNTIES TO A FAIR AMOUNT SOME

02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:34.033
COUNTIES DON'T DO VERY MUCH.

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:36.202
AND SOME COUNTIES HAVE RECENTLY

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:37.436
STARTED DOING MORE WEATHERED

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:39.505
SACRAMENTO OR THE CMS PEAK

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:40.873
COUNTIES THAT HAVE RECENTLY

WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS

02:04:43.542 --> 02:04:45.010
YOU'RE THINKING.

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:45.544
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:46.245

ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE

02:05:08.634 --> 02:05:09.869
REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:10.769
DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.304
WE'RE MANDATED TO PROVIDE

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:13.539
INDIGENT HEALTH SERVICES AND

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:15.307
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES TO OUR

02:05:15.374 --> 02:05:16.108
COMMUNITIES.

EXPANDING MEDIC HELD HER ALL

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:21.947
INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:23.616
IMMIGRATION WE SUPPORTED LAST

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:25.150
YEAR'S BILLS IN BUDGET PROPOSALS.

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:26.886
AND TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:28.187
UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS AND

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:29.655
SENIORS AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:30.623
TO SEE THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S

02:05:30.689 --> 02:05:34.260
PRIORITIZED EXPENDING MEDIC CAL.

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:36.695
HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS THAT --

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:37.663
IT IN GENERAL FINANCING

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:38.964
ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS OF MEDIC

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:40.599
HAL USING ADDITIONAL COUNTY

REALIGNMENT DOLLARS IT JUST

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:44.036
GIVES US GREAT PIES AND I'M HERE

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:45.571
TODAY TO TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:46.772
OF THE ADVERSE IMPACTS TO

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:47.940
COUNTIES THAT --

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.775
WEREN'T YOUR CONSIDERATION ONE

02:05:49.842 --> 02:05:51.076
CRITICAL USE OF HEALTH

02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:51.944
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THAT THE

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:53.479
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.314
ADDRESS IS THE PROVISION OF

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.116
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES --

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:58.784
UNDER AB EIGHTY FIVE THE FORMULA

02:05:58.851 --> 02:05:59.985
INCLUDES A MECHANISM TO ALLOW

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:01.854
COUNTIES TO RETAIN A PERCENTAGE

02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:03.489
OF FUNDING THAT WAS HISTORICALLY

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.224
USED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES.

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:07.526
HOWEVER FOR AND THE KILLINGS

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:09.061
WERE 60% OF THOSE REALIGNMENT

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:11.463
DOLLARS ARE BEING REDIRECTED THE

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.265
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THAT 40%

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:15.701
WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED WITH THE

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:18.103
JURISDICTIONS AND BUY IT AND AND

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:19.104
WOULD BE A STABLE SOURCE OF

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:20.506
FUNDING FOR A RESIDUAL AN

02:06:20.572 --> 02:06:22.341
INSURED RESPONSIBILITIES AND FOR

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:23.609
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES.

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:24.610
AND LET ME JUST PAINT A PICTURE

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:25.978
OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:27.112
EXPERIENCING ON THE PUBLIC

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:28.280
HEALTH SIDE.

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:29.515
AND CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN A

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:31.650
HISTORIC INCREASE IN THE RATE OF

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:33.052
STDS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS --

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:34.219
WE'RE EXPERIENCING MORE

02:06:34.286 --> 02:06:35.721
DEVASTATING FIRES AND AN UPTICK

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:36.789
IN HOMELESSNESS WHICH BOTH

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.691
CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASED RISK

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:40.426
OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE --

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:43.395
AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING DISEASES

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:45.464
THAT WE THOUGHT WERE FOR

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:47.933
CALIFORNIANS ARE OBESE AND 46%

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.368
OF CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:50.636
THIS LOSS OF ADDITIONAL HEALTH

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:51.971
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS IS REALLY

02:06:52.037 --> 02:06:53.339
GOING TO CRIPPLE OUR ABILITY AS

02:06:53.405 --> 02:06:54.873
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.508
CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:57.710
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:59.211
ASSUMES THAT ALL COUNTIES WILL

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:00.713
CONTINUE OUR WILL EXPERIENCE

02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:01.847
EVENINGS AND WHEN THIS

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.415
POPULATION HAS MOVED INTO BEING

02:07:03.482 --> 02:07:05.217
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT IT

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:06.352
DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE VARIOUS

02:07:06.418 --> 02:07:07.720
WAYS IN WHICH COUNTIES HAVE

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:08.754
FILLED THEIR INDIGENT CARE

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:09.888
RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:10.956
AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.725
UNCERTAINTY AROUND PUBLIC CHARGE

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:13.993
THE FEDERAL THREATS THAT REMAIN

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:15.427
TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:17.496
THE CONTINUE NEED TO ENSURE A

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.264
VIABLE SAFETY NET.

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:19.898
WE LOOK FOR TING GAUGING WHAT

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:21.000
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

02:07:21.066 --> 02:07:23.202
ADMINISTRATION I'M AROUND THESE

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:24.436
ISSUES AND WE JUST ASK THAT YOU

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:25.771
AND CONTINUE JUST TO THINK ABOUT

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.673
HOW FUNDAMENTAL NINETEEN NINETY

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:28.907
ONE REALIGNMENT IS TO LOCAL

02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:29.675
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:31.443
BOTH TO OUR OBLIGATION TO

02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:32.745
PROVIDE INDIGENT CARE SERVICES

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.747
BUT ALSO TO OUR OBLIGATION TO

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:36.315
PROVIDE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES

02:07:36.382 --> 02:07:38.317
AND AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.585
TIME WHERE GREATER INVESTMENTS

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:40.986
INTO PUBLIC HEALTH IS NEEDED.

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:42.921
AND SO THIS PROPOSAL JUST GIVES

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.823
US PAUSE BECAUSE OF THOSE.

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.501
PRESENTATION REGARDING PUBLIC

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:56.468

ARE HEALTH CAMILLE BE LOOKING AT

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:00.039
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:01.373
THE LACK THERE OF AND I KNOW

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.042
THAT -- WELL

02:08:03.108 --> 02:08:04.977
THAT BASICALLY IN RECESSION MANY

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.779
COUNTIES CUT BACK THEIR PUBLIC

02:08:06.845 --> 02:08:08.914
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS --

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.149
WE'VE MADE SOME I GUESS IT JUST

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.651
MEANS TO REALIGNMENT THAT --

02:08:12.718 --> 02:08:14.086
PRIME MEANS FEWER DOLLARS ARE.

02:08:14.153 --> 02:08:15.921
TRICKLING DOWN TO PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:17.022

WELL I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:20.592
GOING TO HAPPEN EACH YEAR I IT

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:21.894
SEEMS LIKE WE ALWAYS KIND OF

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.395
WONDER TO OUTBREAKS OF SOMETHING.

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:25.330
AND THEN WE HAVE THE ON GOING --

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:26.632
ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE I GUESS DUTIES

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:28.500
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BABIES

02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:29.935
BORN WITH SYPHILIS.

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:32.071
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:32.905
I MEAN.

02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:35.007
SOMETHING'S GONE VERY WRONG.

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.275
SO -- SO WE

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.509
SINCE WE SHOULD CERTAINLY LOOK

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:40.079
AT THAT AND SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:08:40.145 --> 02:08:41.080
TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.448
AND STRUCTURE --

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:43.849
NOT THAT I WANT TO OPEN UP

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.150
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT --

02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:46.552
BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW THOSE

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:50.522
DOLLARS SLOW INTERPLAY HAPPENS

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:53.125
BETWEEN --

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:55.160
BETWEEN COUNTY AND AND AND AND

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:57.996

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.046
YOUR YOUR POSITIONS --

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.280
REALIGNMENT IT'S BEEN A KIND OF

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:18.383
AN AWKWARD.

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.919
STRATEGY FOR COUNTIES AB ONE AND

02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:22.387
I BEING THE MOST RECENT WHICH

02:09:22.454 --> 02:09:23.689
YOU KNOW YOU GIVE US ALL THE

WORK AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND

THEN YOU SAY YOU'LL FIND IT BUT

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:28.827
THE FUNDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN --

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:30.896
BELOW WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS HAVE

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:32.264
BEEN SO IT'S BEEN ROLLED REAL

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:34.133
DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WITH AB ONE

02:09:34.199 --> 02:09:36.201

COUNTY SO WE'RE PAYING SOME

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:39.471
PRETTY SERIOUS.

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:42.741
HEALTH CARE COST SO I'M JUST THE

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:44.610
CURIOUS ABOUT --

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.445
THIS REVERSE REALIGNMENT IDEA IT

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:47.446
WAS SORT OF IT WHEN I WHEN I WAS

02:09:47.513 --> 02:09:48.480
REVIEWING THE MATERIAL I WAS I

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:50.649
THOUGHT THIS IS THIS IS UNIQUE

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.584
OUT ARE WE HOW DO WE DO THAT SO.

02:09:52.651 --> 02:09:55.320
THANK YOU FOR DRAW --

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.522
YOU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT

02:09:56.588 --> 02:09:58.490
DISEASES THOUGHT OR EDUCATED OR

02:09:58.557 --> 02:09:59.958
SHOWING INCREASES COULD YOU.

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:02.761
EXPAND ON THAT.

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.063
SURE I THINK AND WE'RE SEEING

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:06.398
THINGS LIKE TYPHUS WERE SEEING

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:06.965
YOU KNOW.

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.300
OTHER THIRD OF MEASLES I THINK

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:10.269
EVERY DAY THERE'S A NEW THREAT

02:10:10.335 --> 02:10:11.503
TO PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S THAT'S

02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:14.973
COMING OUT IN THE THIS IS NOT --

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.242
THEY'RE NOT UNCOMMON AS THE

02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:17.976
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:20.145
ISSUE TO REPORT IN TWENTY

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:20.979
SIXTEEN AND I BELIEVE THEY'LL

02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:22.347
PUBLISH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:10:22.414 --> 02:10:22.881
REPORT.

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.249
THERE ARE THERE ARE A TONS OF

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:25.884
DISEASES THAT ARE AROUND THAT

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:28.854
pGRAPPLING WITH AND WE DO A LEVEL

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.689
OF INVESTIGATION I'M IN CONTACT

02:10:30.756 --> 02:10:32.057
TRACING AND SO FORTH.

02:10:32.124 --> 02:10:32.925
AND THEN WE ALSO TAKE

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.393
PRECAUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:35.294
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THE

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.195
SPREAD --

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:37.696
AND THEN I I ALSO WOULD WANT TO

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.931
HIGHLIGHT NOT THAT IT'S DISEASES

02:10:38.997 --> 02:10:39.798
THAT WE THOUGHT WERE ONCE A

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:40.966
RADIC HEATED BUT EVEN THINGS

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:42.201
LIKE A NARROW OUTBREAK.

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:43.602
I THINK WE FAIL TO THINK ABOUT

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:45.904
HOW OLD THESE THINGS CAN IMPACT

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.272
AT PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:48.674
COMMUNITIES THE ELDERLY AND

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.942
CHILDREN AND SO FORTH.

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:51.343
AND I AM I PAINTED THE PICTURE

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:52.878
OF HOW WILD FIRES IN THE

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:54.713
INCREASE OF THAT REALLY CRIPPLES

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.081
OR PUTS ADDITIONAL PRESSURES ON

02:10:56.148 --> 02:10:57.449
A PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM.

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:58.550
AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO

02:10:58.617 --> 02:10:59.585
BE LEARNED ABOUT THE WILDFIRE

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:00.852
EXPERIENCE IN BICU COUNTY

02:11:00.919 --> 02:11:01.987
WHERE THERE WERE THREE OUTBREAKS

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.388
OF NARAL BUYERS HAPPENING AND

02:11:03.455 --> 02:11:04.623
HOW OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT%

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:06.024
BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AT

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:07.259
THE STATE LEVEL HAD TO BRING IN

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:09.261
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO TRY TO

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:10.796
ADDRESS. TO ISOLATE AND

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:12.564
PARTICULARLY IN A SETTING WHERE

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:13.432
IT YOU KNOW IT'S A CONGREGATE

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:14.533
CARE SETTING AND YOU'RE NOT AND

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.934
YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:17.436
AND THINGS OF THAT MATTER SO WE

02:11:17.502 --> 02:11:18.971
WILL CONSTANTLY CONTINUOUSLY

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.939
HAVE PRESSURES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:22.407
I THINK OUR FLU SEASON HAS.

02:11:22.474 --> 02:11:23.809
VARIOUS RAMP UPS AND IT'S MY

02:11:23.875 --> 02:11:25.244
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S STARTING

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.778
TO GET A LOT WORSE RIGHT NOW --

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:31.250
AND SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE IN A

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:32.951
NEW THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:34.419
THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:35.721
THANK YOU THIRTY BILL.

02:11:35.787 --> 02:11:37.155
I'M INTERESTED IN THE REACTION

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:39.091
FROM OUR OUR REPRESENTATIVES --

02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:44.196
READ COMMENTS ON HOW THAT WOULD --

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:46.365
AFFECT.

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:48.400
IN THE ATTEMPTS THAT WE HAVE IN

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:50.135
CALIFORNIA TO ADD.

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:53.005

ALL. TO UNDOCUMENTED AND ALSO.

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.145
OF THE WHOLE [inaudible]

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:01.980
CASH.

02:12:02.047 --> 02:12:05.851
PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRANTS.

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:07.919
IN TERMS OF PAYING CASH HOW THAT

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:11.657
BECOMES A EXPLOITIVE

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:11.957
[inaudible]

02:12:12.024 --> 02:12:14.426
MEDICAL SYSTEM.

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:14.993
IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.895
PLEASE I'D APPRECIATE OR AND

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:17.896
THANK YOU FOR BRING UP THE

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:19.531
COMMON A PUBLIC CHARGE --

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.533
I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.235
ANECDOTALLY AND A LOT OF OUR

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.270
COMMUNITIES IS THAT.

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:26.638
THE CONSTANT --

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:28.173
A STRESS THAT THEY'RE NOW FACING

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.575
AND TRAUMA NOT ONLY FROM PUBLIC

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:32.277
CHARGER PROPOSALS THAT --

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:33.845
GENERALLY PEOPLE DON'T

02:12:33.912 --> 02:12:35.380
UNDERSTAND AT THIS TIME --

02:12:35.447 --> 02:12:36.848
IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BUT

02:12:36.915 --> 02:12:38.950
ALSO FROM THINGS LIKE ICE RAIDS

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.085
AND FAMILY --

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.887
DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATIONS AND

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:44.556
SEPARATIONS --

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:45.123
THERE'S A GENERAL SENTIMENT

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:49.561
AROUND FEAR AND SO WITH THAT I

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:51.263
RELATION OF PUBLIC CHARGE ON

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.464
BECAUSE THERE IS NO FINAL

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:53.932
PROPOSED RULE WE CAN'T

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:56.034
NECESSARILY SAY WHAT WILL BE

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:56.601
AFFECTED WHAT WILL NOT BE

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:57.803
AFFECTED --

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.638
AND AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED --

02:12:59.705 --> 02:13:01.340
MANY UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS MAY

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:03.075
NOT EVEN BE AFFECTED BUT JUST

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.276
BECAUSE THAT THERE IS THE FEAR

02:13:04.343 --> 02:13:05.677
AND CONFUSION --

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:06.878
ANECDOTALLY RIGHT NOW WE ARE

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.347
ALREADY SEEING AN UPTICK IN

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.281
DESCEND ROLE MEANT --

02:13:09.348 --> 02:13:10.982
BUT WE DO EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.017
HAVE.

02:13:12.084 --> 02:13:13.352
QUITE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IS

02:13:13.418 --> 02:13:14.553
BECAUSE A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:17.155
MAKE STATUS FAMILIES AND ALSO --

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:18.357
SOMEBODY AT ASTUTELY MENTIONED

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:19.991
THAT IF ONE PERSON --

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.860
DOESN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE OR

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:23.662
CAN'T GET IT. FOR ONE PERSON

02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:25.097
FEELS AFRAID BECAUSE THE PUBLIC

02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:27.466
CHARGE THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS

02:13:27.532 --> 02:13:28.100
LIKELY TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:29.568
BENEFIT --

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:31.570
TO THE CASH IS THAT THE CASH --

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:32.871
I'M ISSUE --

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:33.939
WE'RE HAPPY TO GET MORE

02:13:34.005 --> 02:13:35.273
INFORMATION TO THE MEMBERS OF

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.408
THIS COMMITTEE --

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:38.176
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS --

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:43.248
BUT YEAH BY I CAN I STE

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.750
INCENTIVIZING --

02:13:44.816 --> 02:13:47.252
THESE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OFFICIAL --

02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:49.054
BECAUSE THERE IS NO COVERAGE FOR

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:50.288
MEDI CAL FOR UNDOCUMENTED

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:51.790
RESIDENTS OF THE DO YOU HAVE TO

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:54.726
FIND PIECEMEAL WAYS TO FIND CARE.

02:13:54.793 --> 02:13:56.428
OR AGAIN LIKE I SAID A JUST

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:58.330
RESULT IN PERMANENT DISABILITY

02:13:58.397 --> 02:13:59.765
OR DEATH IF THAT PROBLEM CAN BE

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.557
AND COST CAN BE A FACTOR IN THAT --

02:24:26.624 --> 02:24:28.126
WE CAN ALSO STILL BY THE OTHER

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:51.582
OBVIOUSLY THIS APPROACH REQUIRES

02:24:51.649 --> 02:24:52.884
A LOT OF CLOSE COLLABORATION

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:54.519

PROPOSAL AS THE ADMINISTRATION

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:02.420

02:26:02.487 --> 02:26:03.521
IS GOING TO DEPEND ON ONE THE

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:05.356

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:20.571
GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:21.873
ITS POTENTIAL TO ALTERNATELY

02:26:21.939 --> 02:26:24.675
PRODUCE FUTURE FUTURE SAVINGS --

02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:27.745
AT FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:29.780

THE STATE BUT ULTIMATELY WILL

02:26:51.769 --> 02:26:54.238

BETTER.

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:07.084
MUCH QUESTIONS SENATOR MONEY.

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.636
PATIENTS.

02:27:25.703 --> 02:27:28.406
BUT FROM A PHYSICIAN PERSPECTIVE

02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:30.942
OFTEN. ONE DRUG THAT MIGHT WORK

02:27:51.829 --> 02:27:52.964
HOW DOES THAT?

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.399
FLEXIBILITY IN PRESCRIBING.

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:58.836
PLAY INTO THE MASS PURCHASING.

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:00.271
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION --

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:02.406
AS I INDICATED ARE ARE EXISTING

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:04.308
COMMON DRUG FOR MILLER THAT WE

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.710
USE FOR THE STATE INSTITUTIONS.

02:28:05.776 --> 02:28:07.778
DOESN'T YOU KNOW DOESN'T RULE

02:28:07.845 --> 02:28:09.747
OUT THE USE OF ANY DRUG --

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:12.550
PER SE -- WE

02:28:12.617 --> 02:28:13.584
THE UNITED SOME THERAPEUTIC

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:15.786
CLASSES WE A ONE DRUG THAT WE'VE

02:28:15.853 --> 02:28:17.822
IDENTIFIED AS YOU KNOW HAVING

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:19.757
PREFERENTIAL PLATE PLACEMENT.

02:28:19.824 --> 02:28:21.359
AND SO THEIR UTILIZATION

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:22.960
CONTROLS AND OTHER DRUGS THAT

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:25.196
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T USE IT --

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:26.631
BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S AN

02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:27.932
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IS

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.834
REQUIRED TO USE IT --

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.036
THIS IS YOU KNOW NOT RADICALLY

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:32.670
DIFFERENT FROM THE PRIOR

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:35.239
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT WE

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:35.873
EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OWN HEALTH

02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:37.975
CARE -- SO

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:40.678
THERE IS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:44.949
ALLOW FOR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS

02:28:45.016 --> 02:28:45.249
WHERE -- YOU

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:47.652
KNOW. 80% OF THE TIME THE DRUGS

02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:49.453
ARE THE SAME BUT FOR THIS 20% OF

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:52.123
THE POPULATION DRUG AXES REALLY

02:28:52.189 --> 02:28:53.557
YOU'RE BETTER PAT --

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:55.693
EVEN IF IF OVER TIME YOU LEARN

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.061
THAT.

02:28:57.128 --> 02:28:58.763
AS MANY AS 20%.

02:28:58.829 --> 02:29:01.766
WON'T BENEFIT FROM DRUG A CAN

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.968
CAN DRUG BE BE PART OF THAT

02:29:04.035 --> 02:29:05.503
PURCHASING.

02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:07.471
STRATEGY WHEN YOU KNOW.

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:08.706
NON IN SOME OF THESE

02:29:08.773 --> 02:29:10.775
INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE GONNA NEED

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:13.644
TO ACCESS THAT VERSES THE DELAY

02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:15.613
OF OF HAVING.

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:16.981
TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER THE

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:18.749
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES OF

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:20.985
GETTING THAT AUTHORIZATION --

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:23.120
WE DEFINITELY CAN WE DEFINITELY

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:25.089
CAN PURSUE MORE THAN ONE DRUG IN

02:29:25.156 --> 02:29:27.358
A THERAPEUTIC CLASS --

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:31.295
AND TRY AND TRY OUR BEST. TO TO

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.530
OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANNEL

02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:34.298
SPEND TOWARD THE MANUFACTURERS

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:36.934
AND US SEE WHAT THEY'RE WILLING

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:37.501
TO GIVE US.

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:39.370
BEGIN IN JUST LOOKING IN

02:29:39.437 --> 02:29:41.072
ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

02:29:41.138 --> 02:29:43.741
SO CANADA HAS AMONG --

02:29:43.808 --> 02:29:45.576
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE.

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:48.946
DRUG PRICES IN THEY HAVE ABOUT A

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:51.248
SIMILAR POPULATION TO THE ENTIRE

02:29:51.315 --> 02:29:52.583
POPULATION OF THE STATE OF

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:55.686
CALIFORNIA --

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:57.788
YOU'RE BUYING ON BEHALF OF STATE

02:29:57.855 --> 02:30:00.491
ENTITIES COVERING STATE COVERED

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:03.794
PATIENTS --

02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:06.297
HEY IS THERE ANY PROHIBITION TO

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:08.232
CALIFORNIA.

02:30:08.299 --> 02:30:10.601
COMBINING WITH OTHER STATES TO

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:12.870
FURTHER MAXIMIZE OUR LEVERAGE IN

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:14.472
THAT MARKET TO SET REYES ANTI

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:16.307
TRUST ISSUES OR COULD WE PARTNER

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:17.942
WITH OREGON AND WASHINGTON FOR

02:30:18.008 --> 02:30:21.912
EXAMPLE. TO HAVE EVEN A STRONGER --

02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:24.982
LEVERAGE IN THAT MARKET THAT THE

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:27.785
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCER ANY.

02:30:27.852 --> 02:30:29.754
THEY WANT THE CANADA ACCOUNT NOW

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:30.855
THEY WANT THE NOT JUST

02:30:30.921 --> 02:30:34.225
CALIFORNIA BUT A COMBINED --

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:37.862
STATE THE GROUP OF EMPIRES OF

02:30:37.928 --> 02:30:39.196
THAT SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:40.131
IT'S AND IT'S DEFINITELY

02:30:40.197 --> 02:30:41.899
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:44.769
ABOUT AND INNER CONSIDERING --

02:30:44.835 --> 02:30:45.436
ACTUALLY.

02:30:45.503 --> 02:30:48.105
PRICE YOU MENTIONED OREGON

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:51.242
WASHINGTON WHICH WERE THE ONE

02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:52.710
THE THE THE THOSE STATES HAVE

02:30:52.777 --> 02:30:54.311
EXPRESSED YOU KNOW GENERAL

02:30:54.378 --> 02:30:55.079

02:30:56.213 --> 02:30:57.715
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASING AS

02:30:57.782 --> 02:31:00.151
WELL OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S MUCH

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:01.285
BIGGER STATE THAN THOSE TWO

02:31:01.352 --> 02:31:03.754
STATES -- SO

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:05.356
THAT THERE MAY BE YOU KNOW

02:31:05.423 --> 02:31:07.158
FRANKLY THE OTHER STATES MAY

02:31:07.224 --> 02:31:08.726
BENEFIT MORE THAN CALIFORNIA.

02:31:08.793 --> 02:31:09.794
BUT YES THERE ARE POTENTIAL

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:11.295
BENEFITS TO JOINING WITH OTHER

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:12.863

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:14.732
WE CAN IF WE CAN MAKE IT ALL

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:15.466
WORK.

02:31:15.533 --> 02:31:16.634
WHEN I HESITATE TO SAY ME WE

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.135
SHOULD EXPLORE WORKING WITH

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:21.071
TEXAS TOO BUT THAT MAY BE A NON

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:23.007
STARTER CAM?

DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:45.896
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROPOSAL WILL

02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:47.665
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THOSE ENTITIES

02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:48.866
AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:52.203

I THINK.

02:31:58.409 --> 02:31:59.743
I DON'T HAVE --

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:02.012
COMPLETE ANSWER FOR THAT --

02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:03.314
OBVIOUSLY.

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.716
THE EXTENT THE EXACTLY WHO IS

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:07.918

02:32:23.033 --> 02:32:24.568
LEGAL FRAMEWORK --

THEM SO.

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:33.277
I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:34.678
IF WE'RE WORKING WITH SAFETY NET

02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:35.579

02:32:55.699 --> 02:32:56.734
ISN'T IT SO.

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.202
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:59.970
DELTA IS AND THEY'RE EITHER

02:33:00.037 --> 02:33:01.405

WHATEVER WERE.

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:28.399
TALKING WITH SOMEONE ABOUT

02:33:28.465 --> 02:33:31.135

DANCE FOR A QUICK SECOND --

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:40.010
BUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:41.779
INCLUDE A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:45.449
TIMELINE FOR KIND OF ROLLING OUT

02:33:45.516 --> 02:33:47.851
THE BULK PURCHASING PROGRAM --

02:33:51.922 --> 02:33:53.390
ELSE PLANNED.

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:55.492
IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT PROVIDING

02:33:55.559 --> 02:33:56.594
REPORT TO MORE CURIOUS AS TO

02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:58.896

ALL RIGHT --

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:01.932
LET ME --

02:34:01.999 --> 02:34:04.101
LET ME FIRST ADDRESS STATUS --

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:05.202
WE HAVE --

02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:07.237
COLLECTED DATA FROM ALL OF THE

02:34:07.304 --> 02:34:08.639
STATE MEMBERS.

02:34:08.706 --> 02:34:11.308
OF THE OF THE CPC THEY WERE

02:34:11.375 --> 02:34:13.143
ASKED TO IDENTIFY THEIR TOP

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:15.779
FIFTY OVERALL SPEND DRUGS TO US --

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:18.515
WE RECEIVE THAT DATA WERE STILL

02:34:18.582 --> 02:34:20.718
US OF COLLECTING DATA FROM THE

02:34:20.784 --> 02:34:22.052
LOCAL SOME OF THAT IS STILL

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:23.420
TRICKLING IN.

02:34:23.487 --> 02:34:24.989
BUT WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT THE

02:34:25.055 --> 02:34:26.190
DATA -- Là

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.225
LOOKING AT PRIORITIZATION

02:34:28.292 --> 02:34:30.594
CRITERIA --

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:31.895
FRANKLY THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF

02:34:31.962 --> 02:34:33.664
WORK GOING ON IN PARALLEL

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:35.165
BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVE TIME

02:34:35.232 --> 02:34:36.567
ONCE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT.

02:34:36.634 --> 02:34:39.269
BUT THE REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR --

02:34:39.336 --> 02:34:41.205
THE FIRST FOUR TO THE GOVERNOR'S --

02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:43.707
TO MARCH FIFTEENTH AND SO FAR SO

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:46.810
GOOD IN TERMS OF STAYING ON

02:34:46.877 --> 02:34:48.579
SCHEDULE FOR THE OUT AND WE'LL

THE BILL'S REPORT BE MADE PUBLIC.

02:34:52.182 --> 02:34:52.416
I THINK --

02:34:52.483 --> 02:34:55.753
INITIALLY THEIR INTENDED TO BE

02:34:55.819 --> 02:34:57.688
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S DELIBERATION --

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.089
AND I DON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM

02:34:59.156 --> 02:35:01.191
PROSPECTS OF RELEASING THE PORTS

02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:02.993
REPORTS HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:05.262
NATURALLY WHATEVER DECISIONS

02:35:05.329 --> 02:35:06.597
COME OUT OF THE REPORTS.

02:35:06.664 --> 02:35:07.798
AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:09.366
PROBABLY INCLUDE WHAT DATA WAS

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:11.835
USE WHAT OPTIONS WERE CONSIDERED

02:35:11.902 --> 02:35:13.137
I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE A

02:35:13.203 --> 02:35:14.171
LOT OF WHAT'S IN THE REPORT NOW

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:16.807
WHETHER IN FACT THAT EXACT

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.842
REPORT IS RELEASED I DON'T KNOW

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:19.143
[inaudible]

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.144
TURNER.

02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.078
I THINK WHAT MOST OF US ARE

02:35:21.145 --> 02:35:22.279
CONCERNED ABOUT AS ELECTED

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:24.181
OFFICIALS WHAT I ASSUME IS

02:35:24.248 --> 02:35:25.482
REALLY DRIVING --

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:27.284
THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THAT MATTER

02:35:27.351 --> 02:35:29.053
THE THE PRESIDENT'S INTEREST IN

02:35:29.119 --> 02:35:31.021
A TO BE TO CONTROL THE COST OF

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:33.190
PHARMACEUTICALS IS REALLY MAKING

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:35.526
SURE THE CONSUMERS --

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:38.195
EXPERIENCE A SAVINGS THE BOOKS

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:41.031
AND SO THAT THAT THEY BENEFIT

02:35:41.098 --> 02:35:41.832
FROM THE LOWER CLASS.

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:43.567
SO.

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:45.769
I'M CURIOUS AS TO TO WHETHER OR

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:47.004
NOT -- YOU

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:48.472
CAN GUARANTEE THAT THAT WILL BE

02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:50.074
THE EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY IF

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:50.908
YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW PRIVATE

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:52.976
PAYERS TO BENEFIT.

02:35:53.043 --> 02:35:53.544
FROM THE STATE'S PURCHASING

02:35:53.610 --> 02:35:57.781
POWER.

02:35:57.848 --> 02:36:00.184
THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:01.385
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:02.953
COMPLICATED ISSUES THAT NEED TO

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.354
BE WORKED OUT --

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:05.489
WITH THE PRIVATE PAYER

02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:07.925
PARTICIPATION I THINK ARE PER

02:36:07.991 --> 02:36:09.026
YOU KNOW.

02:36:09.093 --> 02:36:11.895
THE THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING

02:36:11.962 --> 02:36:13.230
POTENTIAL PRIVATE PURCHASER

02:36:13.297 --> 02:36:15.799
PARTICIPATION IS TO GIVE THEM TO

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:17.201
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE TO

02:36:17.267 --> 02:36:19.369
PARTICIPATE IN A BIGGER POOL.

02:36:19.436 --> 02:36:23.207
THEN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE --

02:36:23.273 --> 02:36:25.709
WERE YOU KNOW THE THE POINT IS

02:36:25.776 --> 02:36:27.277
TO GET LOWER A PRESCRIPTION DRUG

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:30.080
PRICES. FOR ALL THE PARTICIPANTS --

02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:31.915
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:34.017
AND WE AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT

02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:38.822
WOULD HAPPEN.

02:36:38.889 --> 02:36:39.490
IT'S OUR EXPECTATION BUT WE

02:36:39.556 --> 02:36:41.125
THERE'S NO.

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:42.226
AS THE COMMERCIAL SAYS GARY

02:36:42.292 --> 02:36:44.862
AUNTIE.

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:46.029
IF AYE AYE THERE ARE WERE ALL

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:47.331
WERE WERE WERE A MONTH IF IT

02:36:47.397 --> 02:36:48.265
WERE A MONTH AND TO IMPLEMENT

02:36:48.332 --> 02:36:49.833
MANNING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:51.502
I YOU KNOW.

02:36:51.568 --> 02:36:53.036
I THINK THE WHOLE POINT.

02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:56.607
IS TO OBTAIN LOWER PRICES GET TO

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:59.209
A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE MAKING A

02:36:59.276 --> 02:37:02.446
DECISION WHERE WHERE.

02:37:02.513 --> 02:37:05.783
ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE DECISION IS

02:37:05.849 --> 02:37:07.718
TO DO SOMETHING THAT MOVES

02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:09.286
FORWARD BUT GOES IN THE WRONG

02:37:09.353 --> 02:37:11.021
DIRECTION IN TERMS OF GETTING

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:11.922
LOWER PRICES.

02:37:11.989 --> 02:37:12.990
I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.225
TAKE THE OTHER APPROACH --

02:37:15.292 --> 02:37:17.594
WITH YOU KNOW OUR FOCUS

02:37:17.661 --> 02:37:20.831
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:37:20.898 --> 02:37:21.832
AT THE AT THE AGGRESSIVE

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:23.934
TIMELINE TO DELIVERABLES IN THE

02:37:24.001 --> 02:37:25.135
EXECUTIVE ORDER.

02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:27.137
BOTH ULTIMATELY WERE TRYING TO

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:29.239
MAKE THIS A BENEFIT FOR THE

02:37:29.306 --> 02:37:31.441
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AND THINGS

02:37:31.508 --> 02:37:33.043
THAT ARE TO BENEFIT FRUIT PEOPLE

02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.744
CALIFORNIA --

02:37:33.811 --> 02:37:36.680
NOT THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO.

02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:38.782
GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:39.283
ANY -- FINAL

02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:43.554
QUESTIONS OH MY GOODNESS.

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.721
SENATOR SHOULD OWN FOLLOWED BY

02:37:44.788 --> 02:37:47.658
SENATOR MORE LOT.

02:37:47.724 --> 02:37:51.862
ANSWERED OPINION AMOUNT OF CHAIR --

02:37:51.929 --> 02:37:53.797
I WONDER FIRST OF ALL SAY I LINE

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:56.533
MY CONCERNS WITH US SENATE ROTH

02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:57.968
OF THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM

02:37:58.035 --> 02:37:59.469
ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THE MORE

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:01.738
RURAL AREAS WITH HOSPIALS THAT.

02:38:01.805 --> 02:38:03.440
HAVE --

02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:06.210
THESE DRUG DISCOUNT PRO CLOSE

02:38:06.276 --> 02:38:08.345
THE DOORS AND WILL HAVE OTHER

02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:11.448
PROBLEMS ON OUR WATCH --

02:38:11.515 --> 02:38:13.383
YOU MENTIONED --

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:15.819
AND NEGOTIATING WITH --

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:17.988
SIMILAR PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASSES

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:20.357
OF DRUGS TO PUT ONE ON A

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:21.925
FORMULARY AND AND ANSWER --

02:38:21.992 --> 02:38:23.961
CENTER MONIES QUESTION OF

02:38:24.027 --> 02:38:25.729
PHYSICIANS CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR

02:38:25.796 --> 02:38:27.197
PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS THIS

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:28.699
ATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO THIS

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:29.933
BRAND NAME DRUG IN THE START

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.902
WORK THE SAME WAY.

02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:32.536
AND THEREFORE THAT'S THE ONLY

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:34.104
DRUG THAT THEY CAN BE PUT ON AN

02:38:34.171 --> 02:38:35.272
ULTIMATELY THEY THEY DO ONE THE

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:35.973
QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU CAN

02:38:36.039 --> 02:38:37.474
NEGOTIATE WITH THEM IF THEY'RE

02:38:37.541 --> 02:38:39.643
NOT THE DRUG OF CHOICE ON ON A

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:41.078
FORMULARY.

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:42.512
BUT ONE AREA THAT HAS SEEN

02:38:42.579 --> 02:38:44.581
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN A YOU

02:38:44.648 --> 02:38:46.683
YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS AT AND THAT

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:48.952
IS THE ISING COST OF GENERIC

02:38:49.019 --> 02:38:50.320
DRUGS --

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:53.257
THERE WE DON'T SEE THE THE

02:38:53.323 --> 02:38:55.392
DELIVERY OF NEWER DRUGS COMING

02:38:55.459 --> 02:38:56.693
ON THE MARKET LIKE WE DID IN THE

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:59.363
EIGHTIES NINETIES --

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:00.864
GETTING THROUGH THE FTA AS A

02:39:00.931 --> 02:39:03.100
VERY ARDUOUS LONG COMPREHENSIVE

02:39:03.166 --> 02:39:04.401
PROCESS IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE

02:39:04.468 --> 02:39:06.036
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE DRUGS ARE

02:39:06.103 --> 02:39:06.603
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE BUT A WAY

02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:07.304
THAT.

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:08.372
DRUG COMPANIES ARE BOOSTING

02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:14.011
THEIR PROFITS IS TAKING DRUGS AT

02:39:14.077 --> 02:39:14.544
YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY AS AN

02:39:14.611 --> 02:39:17.948
EXAMPLE FOR HE'S NOW --

02:39:18.015 --> 02:39:21.118
THEY'VE GONE UP TO IN SOME CASES --

02:39:21.184 --> 02:39:21.818
FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND

02:39:21.885 --> 02:39:23.654
DOLLARS A THOUSAND SO YOU IT'S

02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:25.122
NOT THE INGREDIENTS HAVE GONE UP

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:26.657
IT'S JUST THAT.

02:39:26.723 --> 02:39:28.058
THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY'RE

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:29.893
GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE.

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:30.961
SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS

02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:35.065
THAT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING --

02:39:35.132 --> 02:39:36.900
FOR PREFERRED --

02:39:36.967 --> 02:39:38.602
DRUGS ON A FORMULARY LIST THAT

02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:39.603
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT MANUFACTURES

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.004
AND GET THESE MANUFACTURERS TO

02:39:41.071 --> 02:39:44.007
COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER --

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:47.611
ALSO I THINK --

02:39:47.678 --> 02:39:49.613
PURCHASING IN VOLUME IS IS VERY

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:50.714
VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IF

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.616
YOU'RE GIVING EXCLUSIVITY TO

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:54.151
CERTAIN FORMULARIES AND IT

02:39:54.217 --> 02:39:54.818
SOUNDS LIKE --

02:39:54.885 --> 02:39:56.420
YOU DO SOME OF THE BIDDING FOR

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:57.487
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU

02:39:57.554 --> 02:39:59.356
DON'T DO MUCH FOR UNIVERSITY

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:01.158
CALIFORNIA OR MEDI CAL.

02:40:01.224 --> 02:40:02.259
SO -- WHILE

02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:03.760
I HAVE NEVER BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF

02:40:03.827 --> 02:40:07.364
THE EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT --

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.365
I'M GONNA FLOOR ON AN IDEA THAT

02:40:08.432 --> 02:40:09.766
I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK WE

02:40:09.833 --> 02:40:10.667
SHOULD FOR THE CALIFORNIA

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:13.136
DEPARTMENT PRESCRIPTION

02:40:13.203 --> 02:40:15.005
PURCHASING AN ADJUDICATION.

02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:16.840
AND WHAT I THINK THE STATE OF

02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:18.308
CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO.

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:21.611
IS GET INTO THE PBM BUSINESS AND

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:23.613
WE SHOULD HAVE A STATE PBM.

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:24.781
THE MAYBE CUT CONTRACT WITH

02:40:24.848 --> 02:40:26.616
WASHINGTON CONTRACT WITH OREGON

02:40:26.683 --> 02:40:28.018
DO THEIR EACH INDICATIONS AND

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:28.952
INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THESE

02:40:29.019 --> 02:40:30.887
PRIVATE COMPANIES TO OPERATE IN

02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:31.989
A BLACK BOX.

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:33.790
AN EXTRACT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:36.860
AWAY FROM LORING PREMIUMS AND

02:40:36.927 --> 02:40:39.930
BENEFITS FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES

02:40:39.997 --> 02:40:41.898
THAT WE SHOULD BE AT THAT TABLE

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:43.200
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME WHAT THE

02:40:43.266 --> 02:40:44.301
STATE IS TRYING TO DO IS

02:40:44.368 --> 02:40:46.136
RECREATE THE WHEEL THAT THE P.

02:40:46.203 --> 02:40:47.738
B. M.'S OF ALREADY.

02:40:47.804 --> 02:40:49.740
DONE -- BUT

02:40:49.806 --> 02:40:51.274
WHY SHOULD WE YOU KNOW ALLOW

02:40:51.341 --> 02:40:52.309
THEM.

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:53.543
TO SIPHON OFF BILLIONS OF

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:54.444
DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF

02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:56.146
CALIFORNIA WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:57.414
IS WE HAVE A DISCUSSION TODAY

02:40:57.481 --> 02:40:58.548
ABOUT PROVIDING.

02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:00.984
CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE OF

02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:03.353
ALL AGES YOU KNOW TO TRY TO SAVE

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:04.554
THE STATE MONEY BECAUSE WE WANT

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.189
TO GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOMS.

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:07.491
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:13.063
IMPLEMENTING A EIGHT A PENALTY --

02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:14.498
TO BACK FILL THE FEDERAL LACK OF

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:17.134
A PENALTY.

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:18.835
HAVING OUR OWN PVM ABOUT WHERE

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:19.936
THE COST OF THE PENALTIES A HALF

02:41:20.003 --> 02:41:21.738
A BILLION DOLLARS HAVING OUR OWN

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:23.407
PBM LADIES AND GENTLEMAN CAN

02:41:23.473 --> 02:41:25.308
RAISE NOT A BILLION BUT BILLIONS

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:27.544
OF DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THE STATE

02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:29.513
OF CALIFORNIA TO EMBARK ON A

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:30.547
SOME OF THE GOALS AND

02:41:30.614 --> 02:41:32.315
ASPIRATIONS --

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:33.617
THAT WE ALL --

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:35.585
EITHER EMBRACE PHILOSOPHICALLY

02:41:35.652 --> 02:41:37.220
OR PARTIALLY --

02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:38.288
SO -- I

02:41:38.355 --> 02:41:41.024
THROW THIS OUT THERE THIS IS A

02:41:41.091 --> 02:41:42.959
BIG IDEA BUT CALIFORNIA.

02:41:43.026 --> 02:41:43.994
SHOULD LOOK AT BIG IDEAS.

02:41:44.061 --> 02:41:46.096
AND AND AND NOT RECREATE THE

02:41:46.163 --> 02:41:47.564
WHEEL MY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE

02:41:47.631 --> 02:41:49.099
GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS IS THAT WE'RE

02:41:49.166 --> 02:41:50.033
NOT GOING TO SEE ANY OF THE

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:53.703
FRUITS OF OUR LABORS TILL.

02:41:53.770 --> 02:41:54.337
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY

02:41:54.404 --> 02:41:55.472
TWO YOU COULD FORMA PBM IN SIX

02:41:55.539 --> 02:41:56.039
MONTHS AND YOU CAN HAVE AN

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:56.973
OPERATING.

02:41:57.040 --> 02:41:59.342
VERY AGGRESSIVELY --

02:41:59.409 --> 02:42:00.644
BY NEXT YEAR.

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:03.380
AND YOU IF YOU FORM YOUR PBM

02:42:03.447 --> 02:42:04.714
YOU'RE NOT GOING AFTER REACH OUT

02:42:04.781 --> 02:42:05.882
TO THE DRUG COMPANIES THEY'RE

02:42:05.949 --> 02:42:07.117
GOING TO REACH OUT TO YOU THEN

02:42:07.184 --> 02:42:08.018
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM LINED

02:42:08.085 --> 02:42:09.386
UP AT A TABLE.

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.822
AND BELIEVE ME YOU CAN GET SOME

02:42:11.888 --> 02:42:13.256
SIGNIFICANT --

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:16.460
BREAKS THAT ARE ON UP WE DON'T

02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:17.360
KNOW ABOUT.

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:20.630
HOW PBM IS TRULY OPERATE BUT WE

02:42:20.697 --> 02:42:21.932
DO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT USED TO

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.500
BE A SWITCH OF FIFTEEN CENTS AS

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:25.669
A TRANSACTION MEDIATOR BETWEEN A

02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:27.037
PATIENT AND A?

02:42:27.104 --> 02:42:28.405
IN A AN INSURANCE COMPANY.

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:29.806
COMPANIES LIKE EXPRESS SCRIPTS

02:42:29.873 --> 02:42:31.174
THAT HAVE A VALUE OF FIFTY

02:42:31.241 --> 02:42:32.909
BILLION DOLLARS BELIEVE ME IT'S

02:42:32.976 --> 02:42:34.144
NOT FROM GETTING FIFTEEN CENTS A

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:35.245
TRANSACTION --

02:42:35.312 --> 02:42:36.947
TRANSMITTING PRESCRIPTION CLAIMS

02:42:37.013 --> 02:42:38.782
SO I SAY WE OUGHT TO TAKE THAT

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:41.885
OPPORTUNITY INVESTIGATED HAVE

02:42:41.952 --> 02:42:43.687
OUR OWN CALIFORNIA PBM HAVE OUR

02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:45.322

02:42:45.388 --> 02:42:46.823

WHICH WILL I GUARANTEE YOU BRING

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:50.127
AND THOUSANDS MORE THAT'S GOING

02:42:50.193 --> 02:42:51.027
TO COST US TO CREATE THIS

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:53.830
DEPARTMENT WE GET ONLINE FASTER

02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:54.798
AND WE GIVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT

02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:56.299
OUR CITIZENS DESERVE AND NEED AT

02:42:56.366 --> 02:42:58.401
THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE SO.

02:42:58.468 --> 02:42:59.503

THIS VOLLEY --

02:43:06.209 --> 02:43:07.210
WHAT THAT WILL THANK THANK YOU

02:43:07.277 --> 02:43:08.712
FOR THE SUGGESTION I MEAN?

02:43:08.778 --> 02:43:09.713
WE'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

02:43:09.779 --> 02:43:11.548
IMPLEMENTATION IN THERE A LOT OF

02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:13.416
DIRECTIONS THAT WE CAN GO IN --

02:43:13.483 --> 02:43:16.486
I'M I'M GLAD THE WORK HEARING

02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:17.821
IDEAS THAT ABOUT.

02:43:17.888 --> 02:43:20.390
A POTENTIAL ULTIMATE SOLUTIONS --

02:43:20.457 --> 02:43:21.858
I WOULD SAY.

02:43:21.925 --> 02:43:25.262
WE'RE ACUTELY AWARE THAT.

02:43:25.328 --> 02:43:27.764
IN MANY YOU KNOW IT THAT IN MANY

02:43:27.831 --> 02:43:29.666
CASES THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:31.234
AMOUNT OF VALUE THAT'S BEING

02:43:31.301 --> 02:43:33.870
CAPTURED BY THE PBM --

02:43:33.937 --> 02:43:36.039
THAT WE DON'T REALLY WE DON'T

02:43:36.106 --> 02:43:37.574
NECESSARILY KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE

02:43:37.641 --> 02:43:39.943
THE THE PAYMENTS ARE GOING TO

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.744
WERE FROM.

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.546
THE STATE THIS IS MORE OF AN

02:43:42.612 --> 02:43:43.680
ISSUE.

02:43:43.747 --> 02:43:45.215
DTS.

02:43:45.282 --> 02:43:46.950
DOES VERY LITTLE PEAK WORK WITH

02:43:47.017 --> 02:43:48.618
PVM AS WE USE THEM ON A LIMITED

02:43:48.685 --> 02:43:50.187
BASIS FOR SERVICE DELIVERY TO

02:43:50.253 --> 02:43:51.188
CERTAIN.

02:43:51.254 --> 02:43:52.589
POPULATIONS THAT NEED TO USE A

02:43:52.656 --> 02:43:54.591
RETAIL PHARMACY --

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:56.726
FOR THE MOST PART WE DO NOT --

02:43:56.793 --> 02:43:57.994
FOR OUR OWN --

02:43:58.061 --> 02:43:59.863
ACTIVITIES AS A PURCHASE --

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:06.870
BUT THE THE THE CONCEPT OF

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:08.705
FINDING WAYS TO CAPTURE THE

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:11.074
VALUE THAT THE P. B. M.'S ARE

02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:12.442
CURRENTLY CAPTURING IS AN

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:13.810
INTERESTING IDEA AND IT'S

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:14.678
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED

02:44:14.744 --> 02:44:15.478
ABOUT.

02:44:15.545 --> 02:44:17.280
INTERNALLY I DON'T I HAVE NOT

02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:19.249
HEARD THE THE IDEA OF CREATING

02:44:19.316 --> 02:44:22.252
OUR OWN BEFORE BUT I THINK.

02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:23.420
A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES ARE ON

02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:24.921
THE TABLE RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHEN

02:44:24.988 --> 02:44:25.689
I WAS ON THE BOARD OF

02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:27.324
SUPERVISORS WE HAD A VERY BOLD

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:28.058
IDEA.

02:44:28.124 --> 02:44:29.926
WE WE WANTED TO EMBRACE THE THE

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:31.027
PACE PROGRAMS THE WESTERN

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:32.162
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AND CAME

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:33.463
UP WITH A PROGRAM WHERE YOU

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:34.231
COULD --

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:35.765
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY

02:44:35.832 --> 02:44:37.167
FINANCE SOLAR PANELS SO YOUR

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:38.902
PROPERTY TAXES IT WAS SUCH A

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:41.471
GREAT PROGRAM WE SEVERAL WHEN WE

02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:42.739
EXPAND IT STATEWIDE.

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:43.707
AND AS A RESULT WE CREATED

02:44:43.773 --> 02:44:46.876
SAVINGS FOR BENEFICIARIES

02:44:46.943 --> 02:44:47.611
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:49.379
CALIFORNIA DOUBLE YOUR CARD OF

02:44:49.446 --> 02:44:50.247
COURSE GOT SOME ADDITIONAL

02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:51.781
REVENUE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:53.416
FOR EVEN MORE SERVICES.

02:44:53.483 --> 02:44:55.085
TO RESIDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.520
IF WE WE SET UP THE TEMPLATE OF

02:44:57.587 --> 02:44:59.923
A STATE PBM AND WE COULD

02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:01.725
CONTRACT TO STATES LIKE.

02:45:01.791 --> 02:45:03.660
OREGON AND WASHINGTON --

02:45:05.295 --> 02:45:06.930
STREAMS EVEN FOR THE STATE OF

02:45:06.997 --> 02:45:08.698
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHY SHOULD

TO TO MANY OF THE WESTERN STATES

02:45:16.373 --> 02:45:17.374

TRYING TO SEE WHAT OTHER --

02:46:15.298 --> 02:46:18.068
AGENCIES WE CAN WORK WITH --

THE DECISION ON WHETHER WE

TO THE SORT OF BENCHMARK THAT WE

02:47:27.137 --> 02:47:30.940

02:47:31.007 --> 02:47:34.177

ED TO GET THAT WRONG.

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:45.708
I DON'T THINK.

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:48.044
I DON'T THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY

02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:49.579
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:51.381
CERTAINLY WE'RE TRYING CERTAINLY

02:50:05.495 --> 02:50:08.865
ARE GONNA HAVE SOME IDEAS OKAY.

02:50:08.932 --> 02:50:10.833
FOR STATUTORY FOR POSSIBLY

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:12.735
STATUTORY CHANGE --

02:50:12.802 --> 02:50:14.837
THEIR VARIETY OF WAYS THAT YOU

02:50:14.904 --> 02:50:15.371
COULD PUT THE TWO THINGS

02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:18.241
TOGETHER THAT MIGHT NOT BE TGS

02:50:18.308 --> 02:50:19.909

EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WELL OKAY

02:50:21.477 --> 02:50:23.346
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE.

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:27.417
BEING KEPT APPRISED OF THAT ALL

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.184
IS.

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:29.652
NOW IN THE BUDGET SO COMMUTER

02:50:29.719 --> 02:50:30.253
BUT THE HEALTH COMMITTEE CHAIR

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:31.588
BECAUSE NOW BECAUSE THE NEXT

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:32.989
QUESTION IS IS THAT.

02:50:33.056 --> 02:50:34.691
I WAS ASSUMING UNDER EXECUTIVE

02:50:34.757 --> 02:50:36.292
TO WE'RE GOING TO COME TOGETHER

02:50:36.359 --> 02:50:37.594
AYE EXPRESSION TO YOU WOULD THAT

FOR EXAMPLE THE FORMULARY.

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:45.768
AND IS UP TO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN

02:50:45.835 --> 02:50:47.036
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING FORMULA

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:49.238
AIRY.

02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:52.208
DTS L. HAS ITSELF HOW WE'RE

02:50:52.275 --> 02:50:53.610
GOING TO DEVELOP FORMERLY HOOPS

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:54.644
WHO'S PROVIDING INPUT INTO THAT

02:50:54.711 --> 02:50:55.778
FORMULARY.

02:50:55.845 --> 02:50:57.280
SO WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

02:50:57.347 --> 02:50:59.282
ROLE OF PROVIDERS ACTUALLY

02:50:59.349 --> 02:51:00.717
TAKING CARE PATIENTS BE SURE

02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:02.518
THAT THE FORMALLY ANY PART OF IT

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.253
OBVIOUSLY ONE THE BIG GOALS IS.

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:05.855
TO LOWER THE PRICE BUT YOU ALSO

02:51:05.922 --> 02:51:07.290
BE SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:51:07.357 --> 02:51:07.924
RIGHT KIND OF DRUGS HOW DO YOU

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:09.859
DECIDE THAT HADES FIVE DRUGS ARE

02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:12.528
ALL SENSEI DENTICLE ARE NOT OKAY.

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:14.097
YOU KNOW WHAT CLASS LIKE I DID I

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:15.999
SAID ANTI HYPERTENSIVE AS WELL

02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:16.933
AND SAY A PRETENCE OF YOU COULD

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.801
HAVE BETA BLOCKERS YOU CAN HAVE

02:51:18.868 --> 02:51:20.703
DIURETICS YOU CAN HAVE SO YOU

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:21.404
KNOW IS THAT WHAT I DID HOW

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:23.373
BROADLY YOU CLASSIFY THEM AS

02:51:23.439 --> 02:51:25.575
BEING IN QUOTE THE SAME CLASS

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:25.775
RIGHT.

02:51:25.842 --> 02:51:29.879
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU.

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:32.348
CLASSIFY CLASS BETTER THAN

02:51:32.415 --> 02:51:33.916
OTHERS AND SO FORTH SO.

02:51:33.983 --> 02:51:35.418
SO WHO'S MAKING THOSE KIND OF

02:51:35.485 --> 02:51:37.020
DECISIONS BECAUSE EVENTUALLY A

02:51:37.086 --> 02:51:38.521
AND THEN ALSO WHO'S GOING TO

02:51:38.588 --> 02:51:40.456
MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT

02:51:40.523 --> 02:51:41.758
ARE THOSE THE ONLY SAID

02:51:41.824 --> 02:51:42.859
PREFERRED.

02:51:42.925 --> 02:51:45.895
MEDICATION FINE SO WHAT.

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:47.163
ARE THE BARRIERS TO GETTING THE

02:51:47.230 --> 02:51:49.399
QUOTE NON PREFERRED MEDICATION

02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:51.134
SO -- YELLED

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:52.135
AT NO PRIOR YOU TALK ABOUT PRIOR

02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:53.770
AUTHORIZATIONS BY THE WAY

02:51:53.836 --> 02:51:55.104
THERE'S A WHOLE PROBLEM WITH

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:56.606
BIRD PHYSICIAN BURN OUT PRIOR

02:51:56.673 --> 02:51:58.508
AUTHORIZATIONS IN THAT DENIAL OF

02:51:58.574 --> 02:51:59.742
ACCESS TO CARE NOT SAYING THAT

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:01.177
WE DON'T HAVE ANY IS MECHANISMS.

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:02.245
AND ANY QUESTIONS HOW OFTEN THE

02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.480
APPLIED TO FOR EXAMPLE --

02:52:04.547 --> 02:52:05.815
IF YOU NEED A PRIOR

02:52:05.882 --> 02:52:08.017
AUTHORIZATION FOR A QUOTE NON

02:52:08.084 --> 02:52:09.185
FORMULARY DRIVE.

02:52:09.252 --> 02:52:10.653
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU JUST DO

02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:12.221
ONCE AND YOU'RE DONE IS THAT

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:14.057
SOMETHING EVERY REFILL I GOT A

02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:16.426
RECENT RESUBMIT PAPERWORK ON THE

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:18.127
OTHER EXTREME IS IT BY THE WAY

02:52:18.194 --> 02:52:20.263
BECAUSE WE DO MEDI CAL COUNTY BY

02:52:20.329 --> 02:52:22.532
COUNTY AND ALSO WE HAVE COUNTIES

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:24.400
MULTIPLE PLANS MY COUNTY

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:25.535
SACRAMENTO HAS SIX PLANS.

02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:26.469
I BELIEVE --

02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:28.237
SO IF THEY CHANGE FROM ONE PLAN

02:52:28.304 --> 02:52:29.872
TO ANOTHER DO YOU START ALL OVER

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:30.840
AGAIN.

02:52:30.907 --> 02:52:32.108
ARE YOU MOVE FROM ONE COUNTY TO

02:52:32.175 --> 02:52:33.009
ANOTHER DO YOU START ALL OVER

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:34.577
AGAIN OR DO WE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

02:52:34.644 --> 02:52:35.978
WE KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE

02:52:36.045 --> 02:52:37.613
MEDICATION REALLY WORKS FOR YOU

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:38.848
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS

02:52:38.915 --> 02:52:39.515
AGAIN RIGHT.

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:40.049
IF YOU CHANGE --

02:52:40.116 --> 02:52:46.522
MEDICAL GROUPS SO THOSE ARE AS I

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:48.224
AND SO HAVING SOME CLARITY ABOUT

02:52:48.291 --> 02:52:50.126
WHO'S OVERSEEING WHAT.

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:51.594
AND THEN YOUR PROCESS OF

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:52.829
NEGOTIATING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

02:52:52.895 --> 02:52:54.030
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING ESSENTIALLY

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:56.232
FOR ENTITIES THAT.

02:52:56.299 --> 02:52:57.834
TAKE THE MEDICATION AND AND

02:52:57.900 --> 02:52:59.302
STUFF LIKE THAT CDC ARE RIGHT I

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:01.170
MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THE YELLED A

02:53:01.237 --> 02:53:01.904
LOT LIKE THE INMATES ARE GOING

02:53:01.971 --> 02:53:03.639
AROUND BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:53:03.706 --> 02:53:04.173
THAT.

02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.274
SO IT'S NOW IT'S GONNA BE A BIT

02:53:05.341 --> 02:53:06.008
DIFFERENT YOU OF ALL THESE

02:53:06.075 --> 02:53:07.243
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND SO FOR

02:53:07.310 --> 02:53:08.511
THE A DIFFERENT PHARMACISTS YOU

02:53:08.578 --> 02:53:09.345
HAVE MEDICATIONS ARE

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:11.180
ADMINISTERED BY A YOUNG

02:53:11.247 --> 02:53:12.482
CLINICIANS ITS ADDRESS.

02:53:12.548 --> 02:53:16.486
SO HOW IS SO --

02:53:16.552 --> 02:53:17.353
SO ANYTIME YOU'RE GONNA

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:18.421
INTERFACE OR SOMEONE'S GONNA BE

02:53:18.488 --> 02:53:19.021
INTERFACING WITH THE

02:53:19.088 --> 02:53:19.789
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SAYING

02:53:19.856 --> 02:53:20.423
WE'RE NEGOTIATING RIGHT.

02:53:20.490 --> 02:53:21.924
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:23.192
KNOW.

02:53:23.259 --> 02:53:25.361
OKAY WELL WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO

02:53:25.428 --> 02:53:26.796
BE THE PREFERRED MEDICATION

02:53:26.863 --> 02:53:28.498
RIGHT AND HOW MUCH IS THAT DRIVE

02:53:28.564 --> 02:53:30.266

MUCH MORE MARKET SHARE BECAUSE

02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:34.103
THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR

RIGHT SO AND TRY TO GET SOME

02:53:37.106 --> 02:53:39.175
CLARITY AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP

02:53:39.242 --> 02:53:41.110
BETWEEN WHO'S DOING ANY COACHING

WHICH AGENCY IS A D. G. S. R..

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:43.446
AND BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IS A

02:53:43.513 --> 02:53:45.081
BIG PULL AND THEN WHO'S GOING TO

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:46.549
BE SETTING THE RULES FOR ALL

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:48.417

THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLICATIONS

02:55:10.166 --> 02:55:12.835
IS AND HOW YOU SET UP A PHARMACY.

02:55:12.902 --> 02:55:14.570
THEIR NUMEROUS COMPLICATIONS IN

02:55:14.637 --> 02:55:16.005
GOVERNANCE OVER THE PHARMACY OUR

02:55:16.072 --> 02:55:19.876
ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE AGENCIES

02:55:19.942 --> 02:55:21.077
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING.

02:55:21.143 --> 02:55:23.512
IN THE IN THE PURCHASING PROGRAM

02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:24.814
WOODS --

02:55:24.881 --> 02:55:26.716
IDEALLY COLLECTIVELY DECIDE ON

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:28.918
THE PHARMACY --

YOU KNOW DON'T ARE DICTATORS IN

02:55:32.555 --> 02:55:35.291
THAT REGARD WE WERE --

02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:37.326
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE DEPTH OF

02:55:37.393 --> 02:55:39.762
CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN HOW THESE

02:55:39.829 --> 02:55:41.097
MEDICATIONS ARE USED IN THERE

02:55:41.163 --> 02:55:43.132
YET IN THEIR SETTINGS --

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:44.567
SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT.

02:55:44.634 --> 02:55:46.168
WE WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WOULD BE

02:55:46.235 --> 02:55:48.070
A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO SET FOR

02:55:48.137 --> 02:55:50.506
FORMULAR RULES --

02:55:50.573 --> 02:55:53.409

IN ORDER TO SUPPORT GOOD PATIENT

02:55:59.749 --> 02:56:00.416
CARE.

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:02.852
AND AVOID DRIVING THE PHYSICIANS

02:56:02.919 --> 02:56:04.153
CRAZY --

02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:05.488
THOSE ARE BOTH IMPORTANT GOALS A

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:06.889
WITH THE THAT WE WOULD

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:08.724
DEFINITELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT --

02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:10.960
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING

02:56:11.027 --> 02:56:11.727
TO REDUCE THE COST OF

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:14.931
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:16.198
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:17.633
IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH

02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:20.069
GOOD PATIENT CARE --

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:21.904
KEEP IN MIND IT'S AT BOSTON I

02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:22.905
CARE ABOUT PHYSICIANS I GOING

02:56:22.972 --> 02:56:24.373
CRAZY MORE IMPORTANT LIKE THE

02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:25.608
PATIENTS THE BECAUSE OF THE

02:56:25.675 --> 02:56:27.109
PATIENTS GET FRUSTRATED THEY

CAN'T A EDUCATIONS INDEED.

02:56:29.845 --> 02:56:32.882
SO -- AND I

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:33.649

02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:56.238
TERM --

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:57.807
OBJECTIVE --

02:56:57.873 --> 02:56:59.575
WE MAY IDENTIFY IT OF A FEW

02:56:59.642 --> 02:57:00.476

CLASS.

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:33.309
THAT CAN BE AN INITIAL STAGE

02:57:33.376 --> 02:57:35.778
TOWARD EVENTUALLY GETTING TO A

02:57:35.845 --> 02:57:40.216

03:00:56.545 --> 03:00:57.413
AND FOUR WHEN I WAS WITH THE

03:00:57.479 --> 03:00:58.981
DEPARTMENT THE FIRST TIME --

03:00:59.048 --> 03:01:01.016
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT CATALOG

03:01:01.083 --> 03:01:03.219
PRICING FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF

03:01:03.285 --> 03:01:06.755
DRUGS IN MEDIC HOW --

03:01:06.822 --> 03:01:08.757
AND WE HAVE THIS BUT IT WAS THE

03:01:08.824 --> 03:01:13.195
PRICING OVER FOR YOUR FOR DRUGS

03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:15.297
THAT WE EITHER COVER OR HAVE TO

03:01:15.364 --> 03:01:17.233
MAKE AVAILABLE TO BENEFICIARIES

03:01:17.299 --> 03:01:19.235
BASED ON MEDICAL NECESSITY.

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:21.003
MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH SB

03:01:21.070 --> 03:01:23.405
PEN CRACKS --

03:01:23.472 --> 03:01:25.007
THAT AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:26.575
OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD WENT UP

03:01:26.642 --> 03:01:29.111
BY TWO HUNDRED AND 69% SET ONE

03:01:29.178 --> 03:01:31.280
UP FROM EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS TO

03:01:31.347 --> 03:01:32.414
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND

03:01:32.481 --> 03:01:34.516
THAT'S THE CHEAPEST INCREASE ON

03:01:34.583 --> 03:01:35.451
THIS CHART.

03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:36.919
WE HAVE DRUGS --

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:39.855
THAT ARE FOR ANTI CONVULSANT --

03:01:39.922 --> 03:01:43.325
WENT UP FROM FIVE CENTS A TABLET

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:44.593
TO A DOLLAR TWENTY TWO WHICH YOU

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:46.395
SAY THAT'S NOT BAD BUT THAT WAS

03:01:46.462 --> 03:01:49.265
A TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND

03:01:49.331 --> 03:01:50.599
36% INCREASE IN PRICE.

03:01:50.666 --> 03:01:53.002
WE HAVE A DIABETES DRUG THAT

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:55.237
WENT FROM TO CENTS A TABLET TO A

03:01:55.304 --> 03:01:58.574
DOLLAR SEVENTEEN THAT'S A FOUR

03:01:58.641 --> 03:01:59.642
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND 32%

03:01:59.708 --> 03:02:01.143
PRICE INCREASE --

03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:02.611
WE HAVE AN ANTI DEPRESSANT THAT

03:02:02.678 --> 03:02:05.681
WENT FROM EIGHT CENTS A CAPSULE

03:02:05.748 --> 03:02:06.282
TO FIVE DOLLARS AND SEVENTEEN

03:02:06.348 --> 03:02:10.085
CENTS. 6290% INCREASE --

03:02:10.152 --> 03:02:12.888
HYPERTENSIVE --

03:02:12.955 --> 03:02:13.789
WAS -- TWO

03:02:13.856 --> 03:02:15.591
CENTS A TABLET IT WENT TO A

03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:18.927
DOLLAR 854-700-0100 AND 46%

03:02:18.994 --> 03:02:20.062
PRICE INCREASE.

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:21.597
MY FAVORITE --

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:26.468
IS A CAPSULE FOR EARTH THYROID

03:02:26.535 --> 03:02:28.137
THOUGH SENATOR STONE JUST LAUGHS

03:02:28.203 --> 03:02:29.138
I'M GONNA WITH HIM FOR MY

03:02:29.204 --> 03:02:30.973
PHARMACY --

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:32.908
IT WAS FOR SENSE --

03:02:32.975 --> 03:02:34.576
A CAPSULE IT WENT TO TWENTY TWO

03:02:34.643 --> 03:02:35.744
DOLLARS AND NINETY SIX CENTS IT

03:02:35.811 --> 03:02:39.081
WAS A 4900071% IN CRISIS

03:02:39.148 --> 03:02:40.382
INCREASE IN PRICE.

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:42.151
I THINK WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKED

03:02:42.217 --> 03:02:43.519
ABOUT -- THE

03:02:43.585 --> 03:02:44.953
PRICE SCENE --

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:46.055
AND THE FACT THAT IS

03:02:46.121 --> 03:02:48.257
UNSUSTAINABLE --

03:02:48.324 --> 03:02:49.825
MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES DON'T

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:51.126
HAVE --

03:02:51.193 --> 03:02:52.294
THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM THESE

03:02:52.361 --> 03:02:54.129
COST INCREASES WE OBVIOUSLY AS A

03:02:54.196 --> 03:02:56.665
STATE WHERE THE IMPACT OF THOSE

03:02:56.732 --> 03:02:58.801
PRICE INCREASES WE OBVIOUSLY TRY

03:02:58.867 --> 03:03:00.369
TO DO OUR BEST THROUGH --

03:03:00.436 --> 03:03:02.371
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE NEGOTIATIONS

03:03:02.438 --> 03:03:03.539
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

03:03:03.605 --> 03:03:05.307
ENCOURAGING PLANS TO USE THE

03:03:05.374 --> 03:03:07.943
MOST EFFICACIOUS AND EFFICIENT --

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.112
DRUGS AS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK

03:03:10.179 --> 03:03:12.047
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE LARGER

03:03:12.114 --> 03:03:13.982
ISSUES AROUND THE POPULATIONS

03:03:14.049 --> 03:03:15.217
THAT DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF

03:03:15.284 --> 03:03:17.353
EITHER MEDICAL COVERAGE OR THEY

03:03:17.419 --> 03:03:18.454
ARE IN THE DOUGHNUT HOLE IF

03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:20.189
THEIR MEDICARE PART D. RECIPIENT

03:03:20.255 --> 03:03:23.058
OR IF THEY ARE ON THE PRIVATE

03:03:23.125 --> 03:03:24.293
MARKET ND DON'T HAVE.

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:24.793
ON ARE THEY HAVE A HIGH

03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:28.564
DEDUCTIBLE AND THEY'RE AT RISK

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:29.198
FOR DRUGS UP TO A CERTAIN DOLLAR

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:29.431
AMOUNT.

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:31.166
THESE PRICE INCREASES FOR THEM

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:33.502
ARE EXTRAORDINARILY BOTH --

03:03:33.569 --> 03:03:34.903
IMPORTANT AND IN SOME CASES

03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:36.905
SIGNIFICANT SUCH THAT THEY CAN'T

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:38.874
ACTUALLY ACCESS THE DRUG AND SO

03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:40.175
I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF LAY

03:03:40.242 --> 03:03:41.844
THAT OUT THERE FOR PURPOSES OF

03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:43.312
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER.

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:45.447
IS REALLY ASKING US AS A STATE

03:03:45.514 --> 03:03:47.683
DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT SOLUTIONS

03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:49.485
MORE BROADLY NOT JUST SO THAT WE

03:03:49.551 --> 03:03:51.687
SOLVE OUR OWN PUBLIC PURCHASING

03:03:51.754 --> 03:03:53.188
ISSUES AROUND THE PRICE OF DRUGS

03:03:53.255 --> 03:03:54.990
BUT ALSO LOOK TO SOLUTIONS THAT

03:03:55.057 --> 03:03:56.158
CAN HELP.

03:03:56.225 --> 03:03:56.959
NOT ONLY OTHER STATE PURCHASERS

03:03:57.025 --> 03:03:59.728
BUT OTHER PURCHASE YOU KNOW DOWN

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.430
TO THE CONSUMER INDIVIDUAL LEVEL

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:04.800
IN CALIFORNIA SO THOSE ARE THE

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:06.268
KIND OF IDEAS AND

03:04:06.335 --> 03:04:08.270
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOLUTIONS

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:09.805
THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE

03:04:09.872 --> 03:04:11.373
TO THE GOVERNOR BY THE JULY

03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:12.241
TWELFTH ST.

03:04:12.307 --> 03:04:14.076
I'M SPECIFIED IN THE EXECUTIVE

03:04:14.143 --> 03:04:15.744
ORDER -- IN

03:04:15.811 --> 03:04:18.981
THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER IT WAS ALSO --

03:04:19.047 --> 03:04:20.349
DIRECTED THAT WE WOULD BE

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:22.017
CARVING OUT.

03:04:22.084 --> 03:04:23.619
ALL PHARMACY BENEFITS --

03:04:23.685 --> 03:04:24.787
IN THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE

03:04:24.853 --> 03:04:26.255
PROGRAM AND RETURNING THEM TO

03:04:26.321 --> 03:04:28.056
THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM --

03:04:28.123 --> 03:04:29.658
THEIR WORST MULTIPLE REASONS FOR

03:04:29.725 --> 03:04:31.660
THE INCLUSION OF THAT PROPOSAL

03:04:31.727 --> 03:04:33.562
IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER --

03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:34.763
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE FIRST AND

03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:36.698
MOST OBVIOUS IS THAT --

03:04:36.765 --> 03:04:38.567
BY ACCUMULATING ALL OF THE

03:04:38.634 --> 03:04:39.735
MILLIONS OF LIVES WE CURRENTLY

03:04:39.802 --> 03:04:41.003
pOFFER COVERAGE --

03:04:41.069 --> 03:04:41.737
FOR WE HAVE TWO MILLION

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:43.305
APPROXIMATELY IN FEE FOR SERVICE

03:04:43.372 --> 03:04:44.673
WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN

03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:45.941
MILLION IN MANAGED CARE.

03:04:46.008 --> 03:04:48.877
BY PUTTING THOSE ALL INTO --

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:50.345
ONE PURCHASING POOL WE ALL HAVE

03:04:50.412 --> 03:04:51.380
OBVIOUSLY INCREASE OUR

03:04:51.447 --> 03:04:53.582
NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE TO DRIVE

03:04:53.649 --> 03:04:55.417
BETTER DEALS WITH MANUFACTURERS

03:04:55.484 --> 03:04:56.885
AS WELL AS MORE SIGNIFICANT

03:04:56.952 --> 03:04:57.820
REBATES.

03:04:57.886 --> 03:04:59.488
BUT I THINK ANOTHER --

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:03.292
REASON THAT WE AS OF STEP IN AND

03:05:03.358 --> 03:05:05.928
MULTIPLE STEP SOLUTION IS --

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:07.496
FROM AN ACCESS POINT IN YOU KNOW

03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:08.997
SENATOR PAN WAS CERTAINLY

03:05:09.064 --> 03:05:11.667
APPRECIATE THIS AS WELL IS --

03:05:11.733 --> 03:05:12.835
ACCESS -- IN

03:05:12.901 --> 03:05:14.536
MEDI CAL PHARMACY AND A FEE FOR

03:05:14.603 --> 03:05:16.505
SERVICE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE --

03:05:16.572 --> 03:05:19.174
PROVIDER AGREEMENTS WITH 97% OF

03:05:19.241 --> 03:05:20.609
THE PHARMACIES IN THE FEE FOR

03:05:20.676 --> 03:05:22.010
SERVICE SIDE.

03:05:22.077 --> 03:05:23.812
SO ACCESS FROM A STANDPOINT IN

03:05:23.879 --> 03:05:25.047
THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE IS

03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:26.582
ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT IS AND

03:05:26.648 --> 03:05:28.650
THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MARKET

03:05:28.717 --> 03:05:30.519
TODAY -- I

03:05:30.586 --> 03:05:32.120
THINKS THE OTHER THING THAT

03:05:32.187 --> 03:05:32.955
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED

03:05:33.021 --> 03:05:35.858
AROUND IS THE IDEA OF A FORMULA.

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:38.060
IN MEDI CAL SO WE DON'T HAVE A

03:05:38.126 --> 03:05:39.628
FORMULAR YOU WE HAVE A

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:41.997
CONTRACTOR GLASS WHICH IS A

03:05:42.064 --> 03:05:44.166
SERIES OF DRUGS THAT WE HAVE

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:46.201
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES IN PLACE

03:05:46.268 --> 03:05:47.970
WITH ON THE MANUFACTURER'S.

03:05:48.036 --> 03:05:50.105
AND SO --

03:05:50.172 --> 03:05:51.173
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

03:05:51.240 --> 03:05:53.075
BEFORE WE PUT ADDRESS ON THE

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:54.843
CONTRACT DRUG LIST AS WE LOOK AT

03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:56.144
IT FOR EFFICACIOUS NOUS FOR

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:59.014
SAFETY FOR POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE --

03:05:59.081 --> 03:06:00.549
FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES --

03:06:00.616 --> 03:06:02.651
AND OBVIOUSLY COST IS ALWAYS --

03:06:02.718 --> 03:06:04.486
AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR US IN

03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:05.821
THE CONSIDERATION OF THAT.

03:06:05.888 --> 03:06:07.322
PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO GET DRUGS

03:06:07.389 --> 03:06:09.024
THAT ARE NOT ON THE CONTRACTOR

03:06:09.091 --> 03:06:11.059
GLASSED AND THEY WILL CONTINUE

03:06:11.126 --> 03:06:12.361
TO GET DRUGS --

03:06:12.427 --> 03:06:14.129
AS THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:15.430
PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:16.732
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE

03:06:16.798 --> 03:06:18.200
ON THE CONTRACT RECKLESS OR NOT

03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:20.002
THE CONTRACT RECKLESS IS REALLY.

03:06:20.068 --> 03:06:21.136
IN OUR WAY --

03:06:21.203 --> 03:06:22.938
OF SETTING UP A NEGOTIATING

03:06:23.005 --> 03:06:24.606
MECHANISM WITH MANUFACTURERS

03:06:24.673 --> 03:06:25.807
WHICH IS IF YOU WANT TO BE ON

03:06:25.874 --> 03:06:27.342
THE CONTRACTOR OF LIST --

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:28.710
WE TYPICALLY PUT DRUGS ON THERE

03:06:28.777 --> 03:06:30.045
WITHOUT A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

03:06:30.112 --> 03:06:31.747
REQUIREMENT BUT IN EXCHANGE

03:06:31.813 --> 03:06:32.981
THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:33.448
THAT ARE PAID BY THAT

03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:34.616
MANUFACTURE IN ORDER TO HAVE

03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:35.851
PLACEMENT ON THAT LIST BUT IT IS

03:06:35.918 --> 03:06:36.818
NOT.

03:06:36.885 --> 03:06:40.756
A FORMULARY --

03:06:40.822 --> 03:06:42.858
SOME OF THE REASONS --

03:06:42.925 --> 03:06:45.193
ALSO THAT WE ARE OUT WORKING TO

03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:47.462
CARVE THE DRUGS OUT OF THE

03:06:47.529 --> 03:06:49.698
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE --

03:06:49.765 --> 03:06:52.100
WORLD IS AND WE ARE LOOKING TO

03:06:52.167 --> 03:06:53.769
STANDARDIZE BENEFITS ACROSS OUR

03:06:53.835 --> 03:06:55.003
DIFFERENT MODELS AND ACROSS THE

03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:56.138
DIFFERENT COUNTIES.

03:06:56.204 --> 03:06:57.573
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AS A

03:06:57.639 --> 03:06:58.740
PROGRAM --

03:06:58.807 --> 03:07:00.909
WE HAVE CARVE DRUGS IN AND OUT

03:07:00.976 --> 03:07:05.380
BASED ON COST BASED ON NEED --

03:07:05.447 --> 03:07:06.982
SO FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD FACTOR IS A

03:07:07.049 --> 03:07:08.050
GOOD EXAMPLE WE HAVE HAD THAT

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:10.185
INTO THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS

03:07:10.252 --> 03:07:11.520
WE'VE HAD IT OUT IT'S NOW CARVED

03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:13.722
OUT WE HAVE HIV DRUGS THAT ARE

03:07:13.789 --> 03:07:15.390
CARVED OUT THE PLANS ARE NOT.

03:07:15.457 --> 03:07:16.858
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM --

03:07:16.925 --> 03:07:18.660
WE TREAT HEPATITIS C. DRUGS AS A

03:07:18.727 --> 03:07:20.128
CATEGORY--

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:20.996
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE

03:07:21.063 --> 03:07:22.064
REST THEY GET A SUPPLEMENTAL

03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:23.465
CAPITATION PAYMENT --

03:07:23.532 --> 03:07:24.733
BASED ON THE PATIENT BEING

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:25.968
PRESCRIBE SOMETHING IN THE

03:07:26.034 --> 03:07:28.236
HEPATITIS C. CATEGORY AND SO WE

03:07:28.303 --> 03:07:29.838
ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE

03:07:29.905 --> 03:07:30.872
BENEFIT --

03:07:30.939 --> 03:07:32.207
AND CONTINUING TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:07:32.274 --> 03:07:33.842
BEEN A FISHERIES HAVE ACCESS TO

03:07:33.909 --> 03:07:35.143
ALL OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY ARE

03:07:35.210 --> 03:07:36.845
PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PROVIDER WE

03:07:36.912 --> 03:07:38.146
HAVE CHOSEN --

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:39.681
IN THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND IN

03:07:39.748 --> 03:07:41.516
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO SAY

03:07:41.583 --> 03:07:43.218
THAT WE THINK THAT IT IS BOTH --

03:07:43.285 --> 03:07:44.987
BETTER ACCESS FOR THE PATIENT AS

03:07:45.053 --> 03:07:46.722
WELL AS THERE ARE SEVERAL

03:07:46.788 --> 03:07:48.624
PURCHASE SCENE --

03:07:48.690 --> 03:07:51.393
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN USE IN

03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:52.694
THE SHORT TERM --

03:07:52.761 --> 03:07:54.196
AS A STATE BY DOING THAT AND

03:07:54.262 --> 03:07:55.530
PUTTING IT THROUGH THE FEE FOR

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:56.798
SERVICE SYSTEM --

03:07:56.865 --> 03:07:58.233
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY AND

03:07:58.300 --> 03:08:00.802
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IS --

03:08:00.869 --> 03:08:01.937
OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AND

03:08:02.004 --> 03:08:03.772
GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE AS

03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:05.173
WELL --

03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:07.409
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

03:08:07.476 --> 03:08:08.910
ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:08:08.977 --> 03:08:10.512
PROPOSED TO SEE A MASS --

03:08:10.579 --> 03:08:12.314
I THINK THAT --

03:08:12.381 --> 03:08:13.181
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST

03:08:13.248 --> 03:08:15.150
RELEASED A PROPOSED DRAFT RULE A

03:08:15.217 --> 03:08:17.119
COUPLE IT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN A

03:08:17.185 --> 03:08:18.286
WEEK AGO BUT IT FEELS LIKE

03:08:18.353 --> 03:08:19.121
LONGER IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN A

03:08:19.187 --> 03:08:20.789
WEEK AGO --

03:08:20.856 --> 03:08:22.257
TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE

03:08:22.324 --> 03:08:24.092
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN P. B. M.'S

03:08:24.159 --> 03:08:26.094
AND MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS

03:08:26.161 --> 03:08:28.497
AND MEDICARE PART D. PLANS --

03:08:28.563 --> 03:08:29.865
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY

03:08:29.931 --> 03:08:31.867
REMOVES THE ABILITY FOR PM'S TO

03:08:31.933 --> 03:08:34.169
HAVE PREFERENTIAL --

03:08:34.236 --> 03:08:36.738
STEERING OF DRUGS BASED ON THE

03:08:36.805 --> 03:08:37.739
AGREEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE WITH

03:08:37.806 --> 03:08:39.741
THE MANUFACTURERS AND INSTEAD

03:08:39.808 --> 03:08:41.243
TURNING THAT INTO A FLAT FEE

03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:43.512
TYPE OF SERVICE ARRANGEMENT.

03:08:43.578 --> 03:08:47.616
THE THING THAT WE WOULD SAY IT'S

03:08:47.683 --> 03:08:48.884
INCLUDED IN THE FEDERAL THE

03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:50.452
DRAFT FEDERAL RULE IS IT WILL

03:08:50.519 --> 03:08:52.821
INCREASE PRICES IRONICALLY TO

03:08:52.888 --> 03:08:54.056
STATE PURCHASERS AND TO THE

03:08:54.122 --> 03:08:55.657
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NO

03:08:55.724 --> 03:08:56.992
LONGER OUR PLANS GOING TO BE

03:08:57.059 --> 03:08:58.160
RECEIVING EITHER DISCOUNTS ARE

03:08:58.226 --> 03:08:59.061
REBATES.

03:08:59.127 --> 03:09:00.796
DUE TO THOSE PBM ARRANGEMENTS

03:09:00.862 --> 03:09:01.763
AND THERE'S A FLAT FEE AND SO

03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:03.098
ACTUALLY IT RAISES THE COST OF

03:09:03.165 --> 03:09:04.266
DRUGS WHICH IN.

03:09:04.332 --> 03:09:06.968
SOME CASES JUST CONFIRMS THAT WE

03:09:07.035 --> 03:09:07.636
ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH IN TERMS

03:09:07.703 --> 03:09:09.271
OF REMOVING THE DRUGS OUT OF THE

03:09:09.337 --> 03:09:10.305
MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS ALL

03:09:10.372 --> 03:09:11.807
TOGETHER AND PUTTING THEM INTO

03:09:11.873 --> 03:09:12.908
THE FEE FOR SERVICE --

03:09:12.974 --> 03:09:15.610
SYSTEM SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

03:09:15.677 --> 03:09:18.313
ANSWER QUESTIONS.

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:22.884
BEFORE WE DO THAT --

03:09:22.951 --> 03:09:24.853
LET'S HEAR FROM MR MILLER DO YOU

03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:27.522
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD.

03:09:27.589 --> 03:09:29.658
OKAY GREAT MISTER JOHNSON I

03:09:29.725 --> 03:09:32.694
WOULD MEAN GREAT BUT YOU NONE OF

03:09:32.761 --> 03:09:35.831
THE MR JOHNSON --

03:09:35.897 --> 03:09:36.531
SO WE HAVE NOT COMPLETED OUR

03:09:36.598 --> 03:09:37.466
ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:39.167
PROPOSAL BUT SO WHAT I'LL SHARE

03:09:39.234 --> 03:09:40.202
IS REALLY JUST SOME OF THE

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:42.070
THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND

03:09:42.137 --> 03:09:43.405
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING.

03:09:43.472 --> 03:09:45.207
TIME FIRST IS WHAT WITH THE

03:09:45.273 --> 03:09:49.578
PROPOSAL ULTIMATELY RESULT INSTATE SAVINGS --

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:50.879
WE THINK IT COULD --

03:09:50.946 --> 03:09:52.814
IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO

03:09:52.881 --> 03:09:53.749
COLLECT --

03:09:53.815 --> 03:09:54.950
OR AT LEAST --

03:09:55.016 --> 03:09:56.551
FACILITATE THE STATE COLLECTING --

03:09:56.618 --> 03:09:58.520
SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON BEHALF

03:09:58.587 --> 03:10:01.256
OF ALL THE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT

03:10:01.323 --> 03:10:02.724
ARE PAID --

03:10:02.791 --> 03:10:05.327
FOR AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE SO

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:06.394
THIS COULD ROW --

03:10:06.461 --> 03:10:08.263
INCREASED DAY SAVINGS FOR TO THE

03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:09.965
TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

03:10:10.031 --> 03:10:11.299
DOLLARS.

03:10:11.366 --> 03:10:12.768
REFERENCE YOU WE DON'T HAVE A

03:10:12.834 --> 03:10:14.970
SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THAT FOR

03:10:15.036 --> 03:10:16.571
CONTEXT THOUGH -

03:10:16.638 --> 03:10:18.673
THE STAE A WE GOT ESTIMATES

03:10:18.740 --> 03:10:20.475
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE

03:10:20.542 --> 03:10:21.943
STATE DOES SPEND --

03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:23.678
NINE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON

03:10:23.745 --> 03:10:25.480
DRUGS WITHIN MANAGED CARE AS

03:10:25.547 --> 03:10:26.982
OPPOSED TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

03:10:27.048 --> 03:10:28.950
IN FEE FOR SERVICE SO THERE IS

03:10:29.017 --> 03:10:30.719
THOSE ARE QUITE A THAT'S QUITE A

03:10:30.786 --> 03:10:31.820
BIT OF NEW --

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:34.089
SPENDING THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE

03:10:34.156 --> 03:10:36.224
FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON

03:10:36.291 --> 03:10:37.559
CELLS CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THAT

03:10:37.626 --> 03:10:40.028
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

03:10:40.095 --> 03:10:41.530
ADMINISTRATION --

03:10:41.596 --> 03:10:43.532
SOMETIME WILL RELEASE A FISCAL

03:10:43.598 --> 03:10:45.000
ESTIMATE OF THIS AND WILL

03:10:45.066 --> 03:10:46.902
DEFINITELY LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT

03:10:46.968 --> 03:10:48.303
THAT -- I

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:50.472
CYCLE A SECOND SORT OF POTENTIAL

03:10:50.539 --> 03:10:52.374
IMPACT -- IS

03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:53.608
THAT -- AS

03:10:53.675 --> 03:10:55.977
CENTER OFFICE BROUGHT UP --

03:10:56.044 --> 03:10:58.713
IT THIS THIS --

03:10:58.780 --> 03:11:01.650
PROPOSAL COULD RESULT IN SAVINGS

03:11:01.716 --> 03:11:03.485
THAT ARE RETAINED BY THREE FORTY

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:04.486
BE ENTITIES --

03:11:04.553 --> 03:11:06.621
THAT INSTEAD WOULD --

03:11:06.688 --> 03:11:08.056
ULTIMATELY BENEFIT THE STATE SO

03:11:08.123 --> 03:11:09.457
THAT'S ANOTHER AVENUE FOR

03:11:09.524 --> 03:11:12.160
SAVINGS BUT AN IMPACT ON ON

03:11:12.227 --> 03:11:13.595
SAFETY NET PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT

03:11:13.662 --> 03:11:14.429
THE STATE.

03:11:14.496 --> 03:11:16.198
AND THEN THIRD THERE COULD BE

03:11:16.264 --> 03:11:17.966
SOME REDUCE COSTS IN MANAGED

03:11:18.033 --> 03:11:19.901
CARE -- AS A

03:11:19.968 --> 03:11:21.469
RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

03:11:21.536 --> 03:11:22.671
UNDERWRITING --

03:11:22.737 --> 03:11:24.639
COSTS GOING DOWN --

03:11:24.706 --> 03:11:26.541
WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM --

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:28.076
THERE ARE STILL REASONS WE THINK

03:11:28.143 --> 03:11:29.477
TO BE CAUTIOUS --

03:11:29.544 --> 03:11:30.912
ON THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVINGS --

03:11:30.979 --> 03:11:32.414
MEDICARE PLANS CAN LEVERAGE

03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:34.516
THEIR THEIR BUYING POWER TO

03:11:34.583 --> 03:11:36.551
DETAIN YOU KNOW GOOD RATES WITH

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:38.019
PHARMACIES AT THE TIME OF

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:39.855
DISPENSING AND SO FORTH SO WE

03:11:39.921 --> 03:11:41.122
WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT

03:11:41.189 --> 03:11:42.591
THAT WHAT GETS INCLUDED IN THE

03:11:42.657 --> 03:11:44.526
COST ESTIMATES THERE --

03:11:44.593 --> 03:11:47.596
BUT THEN OUTSIDE OF THE COST

03:11:47.662 --> 03:11:49.364
ESTIMATE WERE OF COURSE TRYING --

03:11:49.431 --> 03:11:51.199
TO IMPACTS ON PERRANCE WE

03:11:51.266 --> 03:11:55.470
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL IT COULD

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:56.304
STANDARDIZATION OF THE DRUG

03:11:56.371 --> 03:11:57.305
BENEFIT --

03:11:57.372 --> 03:11:58.874
BUT ALSO WANT UNDERSTAND HOW IT

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:00.909
IMPACTS CARE COORDINATION --

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:02.544
THAT TIMELY SUBMISSION --

03:12:02.611 --> 03:12:05.046
PHARMACEUTICAL UTILIZATION DATA

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:06.915
TO MANAGED CARE PLANS AND TO THE

03:12:06.982 --> 03:12:08.350
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT ARE

03:12:08.416 --> 03:12:09.818
THAT ARE ULTIMATELY COORDINATING

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:10.986
THEIR CARE SO --

03:12:11.052 --> 03:12:13.021
THERE'S NOT A LOT WE STILL A LOT

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:14.089
OF QUESTIONS AND A LOT TO

03:12:14.155 --> 03:12:15.323
CONSIDER IN ANALYZING THIS

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.225
PROPOSAL.

COVERED IN ROWLEY HAS TO GO AND

03:13:21.256 --> 03:13:21.523
JUST.

03:13:21.589 --> 03:13:25.026
PAY CASH FOR IT AND MEDI CAL

03:13:25.093 --> 03:13:26.194

THE CHALLENGES FROM HIM BECAUSE

03:13:36.938 --> 03:13:38.473
IT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE OF EVEN

03:13:38.540 --> 03:13:40.208
GOING TO THE TAR PROCESS BUT IT

03:13:40.275 --> 03:13:43.745
IS DIFFERENT IN THAT THROUGH THE

03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:45.480
TAR PROCESS.

03:13:45.547 --> 03:13:46.548
BE IT ONEROUS AND TIME CONSUMING

BUT YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE

03:13:48.683 --> 03:13:49.451
MEDICATION.

03:13:49.517 --> 03:13:51.386

SERVICE WE PROVIDE THAT DATA AND

03:14:24.252 --> 03:14:25.487
FLOW THAT DATA THE PLANS WE

03:14:25.553 --> 03:14:27.455
FLOAT ON A MONTHLY BASIS I THINK

03:14:27.522 --> 03:14:29.524
THAT WE RECOGNIZE --

03:14:29.591 --> 03:14:31.292

MAKE SOME CHANGES WITHIN OUR OWN

03:14:33.695 --> 03:14:35.430
SYSTEMS WHICH IS WHY IN SOME

03:14:35.497 --> 03:14:36.731
CASES THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

03:14:36.798 --> 03:14:38.733
SAYS JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY

03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:41.369
ONE ISIN WHICH WE WOULD BE

03:14:41.436 --> 03:14:43.071
FLOWING THAT INFORMATION --

03:14:43.138 --> 03:14:45.140
IN A MUCH MORE RAPID WAY SUCH

03:14:45.206 --> 03:14:46.274
THAT PLANS WOULD BE AWARE OF

03:14:46.341 --> 03:14:47.609
WHAT BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING

HOW THE STATE PURCHASES

03:16:40.855 --> 03:16:42.490
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS

03:16:42.557 --> 03:16:44.692
COMPLEX AND OPAQUE BY DESIGN SO

03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:46.261
THAT THE VARIOUS ACTORS CAN

P. B. M.'S.

03:16:52.467 --> 03:16:53.601
WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE

03:16:53.668 --> 03:16:56.004
POSSIBILITIES OF SIR WHICH

03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:58.273
MAXIMIZES THE PUBLIC SECTOR

03:16:58.339 --> 03:17:00.041
SPEND FOR PHARMACY BENEFITS AND

03:17:00.108 --> 03:17:01.809
WHICH INVITES OTHER PUBLIC AS

03:17:01.876 --> 03:17:03.178

03:17:03.244 --> 03:17:04.812

03:17:04.879 --> 03:17:06.381
AND WHILE WE REALIZE THAT MEDIC

03:17:06.447 --> 03:17:08.616

PROGRAMS SUCH AS THREE FORTY

03:17:11.886 --> 03:17:13.888
BEING IN THIS PHASE WE SHOULD BE

03:17:13.955 --> 03:17:15.323
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THE

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:16.824
STATE IS NOT ADEQUATELY USING

03:17:16.891 --> 03:17:18.893

OUR DRUG PURCHASING WHILE AT THE

03:17:21.896 --> 03:17:23.665
SAME TIME PROTECTING MEDICARE

03:17:23.731 --> 03:17:25.767
BENEFICIARIES GUARANTEED ACCESS

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:27.502

AND FOR OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS

03:17:30.638 --> 03:17:31.773
TO REMAIN WHOLE.

03:17:31.839 --> 03:17:33.274
AS ONE EXAMPLE EVEN WITHIN

03:17:33.341 --> 03:17:35.410
MEDICAID OTHER STATES HAVE DONE

03:17:35.476 --> 03:17:36.778
AUDITS AND REPORTS WHICH YOU

03:17:36.844 --> 03:17:39.013
FOUND THAT PVM STILL HAVE A

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:41.249
SPREAD AND THEY POCKET REBATES

03:17:41.316 --> 03:17:42.917
WITHOUT THE STATE PURCHASER

03:17:42.984 --> 03:17:44.018
KNOWING.

03:17:44.085 --> 03:17:46.187
DO OUR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE

03:17:46.254 --> 03:17:47.722
PLANS WHO CONTRACTED P. P. B.

03:17:47.789 --> 03:17:49.924
M.'S TODAY KNOW THAT THEIR

03:17:49.991 --> 03:17:51.926
REBATES ARE BEING PASSED ON AND

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:53.661
IS THERE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE

03:17:53.728 --> 03:17:55.496
SPREAD IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

03:17:55.563 --> 03:17:57.198
THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT.

03:17:57.265 --> 03:17:59.133
TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:00.868
SIGNIFICANT PUSHED BACK TO A

03:18:00.935 --> 03:18:02.937
CARVING THIS OUT INTO FEE FOR

03:18:03.004 --> 03:18:04.606
SERVICE --

03:18:04.672 --> 03:18:05.974
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:07.609
WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE AND I

03:18:07.675 --> 03:18:09.510
THINK EVEN THAT SORT OF PICTURE

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:11.112
OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING

03:18:11.179 --> 03:18:12.547
IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR.

03:18:12.614 --> 03:18:13.948
IN ADDITION ARE WE DOING ENOUGH

03:18:14.015 --> 03:18:15.516
TO ASSASSINATE INCENTIVIZE THE

03:18:15.583 --> 03:18:17.185
APPROPRIATE EFFECTIVE USE OF

03:18:17.252 --> 03:18:18.152
DRUGS.

03:18:18.219 --> 03:18:19.754
ARC RELEASED A REPORT THIS YEAR

03:18:19.821 --> 03:18:21.055
THAT FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:22.323
ANTIBIOTICS --

03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:23.858
IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WORK

03:18:23.925 --> 03:18:25.159
COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND A

03:18:25.226 --> 03:18:26.928
LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WERE FOR

03:18:26.995 --> 03:18:27.895
CONDITIONS.

03:18:27.962 --> 03:18:31.733
THAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A NATION

03:18:31.799 --> 03:18:32.934
WHERE ANTIBIOTIC SHOULD NEVER BE

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:34.869
USED AND SO THERE IS A TON OF

03:18:34.936 --> 03:18:36.571
EDUCATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

03:18:36.638 --> 03:18:38.106
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE

03:18:38.172 --> 03:18:40.108
ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN ON THE BACK

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:42.076

03:18:52.754 --> 03:18:53.955
GENERAL FUND.

03:18:54.022 --> 03:18:55.490
THIS TYPE OF RISK REQUIRES

03:18:55.556 --> 03:18:57.025
CREATIVE POLICY SOLUTIONS

03:18:57.091 --> 03:18:58.259

03:20:13.901 --> 03:20:17.105
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE PROVIDE A

03:20:17.171 --> 03:20:19.173
LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO

03:20:19.240 --> 03:20:20.842
YOUR COMMITTEE AND OTHERS.

03:20:20.908 --> 03:20:22.577
WE THINK WITH SUPPLEMENTAL

03:20:22.643 --> 03:20:24.912
REBATES AND REBATES ON THE MEDI

03:20:24.979 --> 03:20:27.815
CAL PROGRAM CAN SAVE AS MUCH AS

03:20:27.882 --> 03:20:30.318
5260% OF THE DRUG PRICE.

03:20:30.385 --> 03:20:31.786
WE ARE GETTING THE MANDATORY

03:20:31.853 --> 03:20:34.155
REBATE WHICH IS ABOUT 23% --

03:20:34.222 --> 03:20:35.356
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

03:20:35.423 --> 03:20:36.424
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKING

03:20:36.491 --> 03:20:37.992
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL

03:20:38.059 --> 03:20:40.561
REBATES WHICH SHE HAD PIONEERED

03:20:40.628 --> 03:20:42.163
IN THE EARLY NINETIES.

03:20:42.230 --> 03:20:43.431
WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT WE

03:20:43.498 --> 03:20:45.199
HAVE A SINGLE STATEWIDE

03:20:45.266 --> 03:20:47.034
FORMULARY AND THAT IT IS

03:20:47.101 --> 03:20:49.170
NEGOTIATED --

03:20:49.237 --> 03:20:50.471
BY DRUG CLASS TAKING INTO

03:20:50.538 --> 03:20:52.273
ACCOUNT CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS

03:20:52.340 --> 03:20:53.808
RATHER THAN BEING NEGOTIATED

03:20:53.875 --> 03:20:56.310
MANUFACTURE BY MANUFACTURERS SO

03:20:56.377 --> 03:20:58.012
CENTER PAN IN YOUR EXAMPLE OF

03:20:58.079 --> 03:20:59.247
HYPERTENSIVE IS THAT WOULD THAT

03:20:59.313 --> 03:21:00.481
WOULD BE ENOUGH IN.

03:21:00.548 --> 03:21:01.649
EACH OF THE CATEGORIES IN THAT

03:21:01.716 --> 03:21:04.819
IF NONE OF THOSE FOR APPROPRIATE

03:21:04.886 --> 03:21:06.154
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT SOMEONE

03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:08.089
SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THROUGH

03:21:08.156 --> 03:21:09.390
AN APPEAL PROCESS THE

03:21:09.457 --> 03:21:10.825
APPROPRIATE --

03:21:10.892 --> 03:21:13.327
ANTI HAVE PRETENCE OF OFF

03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:14.328
FORMULAR.

03:21:14.395 --> 03:21:16.264
WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST.

03:21:16.330 --> 03:21:18.065
THAT WE LOOK AT INFLATION

03:21:18.132 --> 03:21:20.001
ADJUSTED REBATES --

03:21:20.067 --> 03:21:22.236
OR FLAT AMOUNT SO THAT WE DON'T

03:21:22.303 --> 03:21:23.838
TO AS THE PRICES INCREASING YOU

03:21:23.905 --> 03:21:24.972
HEARD FROM.

03:21:25.039 --> 03:21:26.607
MISS CAN'T THE DIRECTOR ABOUT

03:21:26.674 --> 03:21:28.176
SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC PRICE

03:21:28.242 --> 03:21:30.411
INCREASES THAT THOSE OF THAT WE

03:21:30.478 --> 03:21:32.180
CONTINUE TO KEEP THE AMOUNT TO

03:21:32.246 --> 03:21:34.315
THE STATE FLAT RATHER THAN.

03:21:34.382 --> 03:21:36.050
HAVING IT BE ON A PERCENTAGE

03:21:36.117 --> 03:21:37.218
BASIS.

03:21:37.285 --> 03:21:38.953
LIKE OTHERS WE SUGGEST LOOKING

03:21:39.020 --> 03:21:41.322
MULTI STATE EFFORTS WHETHER IT'S

03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:42.990
EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW OR

03:21:43.057 --> 03:21:43.991
PURCHASING.

03:21:44.058 --> 03:21:45.660
AND WE'RE VERY INTRIGUED BY THE

03:21:45.726 --> 03:21:48.029
IDEA THE STATE PBM AND WOULD BE

03:21:48.095 --> 03:21:49.197
INTERESTED IN.

03:21:49.263 --> 03:21:51.132
AND DISCUSSIONS ON THAT ONE

03:21:51.199 --> 03:21:53.468
FINAL POINT IS AS WERE THINKING

03:21:53.534 --> 03:21:54.135
ABOUT THIS --

03:21:54.202 --> 03:21:55.102
IT.

03:21:55.169 --> 03:21:56.704
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM INCLUDING

03:21:56.771 --> 03:21:58.906
THE MANAGED CARE TRANSFORMATIONS

03:21:58.973 --> 03:22:00.575
OF THE LAST.

03:22:00.641 --> 03:22:02.109
DECADE HAVING WE THINK ABOUT THE

03:22:02.176 --> 03:22:03.678
AC EXPANSION AND BRINGING IN

03:22:03.744 --> 03:22:04.879

AS WE THINK ABOUT THOSE WE'RE

03:22:17.658 --> 03:22:19.227
NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT THE

03:22:19.293 --> 03:22:22.029
MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE --

03:22:22.096 --> 03:22:22.930
BARGAINING IN THE BEST INTEREST

03:22:22.997 --> 03:22:24.232

NECESSARY DRUGS AND THERE IS

03:22:31.772 --> 03:22:33.007
SOMETHING LIKE INDEPENDENT

ACOSTA NAY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND?

03:23:04.171 --> 03:23:05.907

MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR SURE --

03:23:08.910 --> 03:23:10.244
I DO WANT.

03:23:10.311 --> 03:23:11.812
TO GET A CO BEST --

03:23:11.879 --> 03:23:12.747
COMMON ABOUT FORMULAR IS WE WERE

03:23:12.813 --> 03:23:14.148
ROUTINELY APPROVED DRUGS THAT

03:23:14.215 --> 03:23:15.283
ARE NOT ON THE FORMALLY THROUGH

03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:16.684
A PRIOR OFF PROCESS AND WE DO IT

03:23:16.751 --> 03:23:18.152
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AS REQUIRED

03:23:18.219 --> 03:23:20.187
BY LAW. TO WERE VERY QUICK AND

03:23:20.254 --> 03:23:21.822
LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR THE DRUG

03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:23.324
AND APPROVING AT SO I'M GONNA

03:23:23.391 --> 03:23:25.660
TRY TO TALK ABOUT THREE KEY

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:27.662
AREAS JUST AS EXAMPLES NUMBER

03:23:27.728 --> 03:23:29.130
ONE IS OPIOIDS.

03:23:29.196 --> 03:23:31.699
SO WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S THIS

03:23:31.766 --> 03:23:35.069
HORRIBLE WITH MANY PEOPLE

03:23:35.136 --> 03:23:36.203
ADDICTED AND HAVING ISSUES.

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.738
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT AT THE

03:23:37.805 --> 03:23:39.273
TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION NOT

03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.309
AFTER THE FACT IF IT INDIVIDUALS

03:23:41.375 --> 03:23:42.810
PRESCRIBED AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT

03:23:42.877 --> 03:23:44.912
OF AN OPIATE OR THE PRESCRIBED A

03:23:44.979 --> 03:23:46.547
BENZODIAZEPINE ON TOP OF AN

03:23:46.614 --> 03:23:46.981
OPIATE.

03:23:47.048 --> 03:23:48.516
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT RIGHT

03:23:48.583 --> 03:23:50.117
AT THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION

03:23:50.184 --> 03:23:52.119
AND SO WE DO CLINICAL WORK. FOR

03:23:52.186 --> 03:23:53.854
THOSE MEMBERS GET THEM INTO PAIN

03:23:53.921 --> 03:23:55.489
MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW FIND

03:23:55.556 --> 03:23:57.858
ALTERNATIVES FOR THEM AND DEAL

03:23:57.925 --> 03:23:59.427
DIRECTLY WITH THEIR PRESCRIBER

03:23:59.493 --> 03:24:00.227
IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE

03:24:00.294 --> 03:24:01.529
PRESCRIBERS OF THE GOING TO

03:24:01.596 --> 03:24:03.064
MULTIPLE PHARMACIES WE GOT A

03:24:03.130 --> 03:24:04.966
DEAL WITH THAT IN THE MOMENT SO

03:24:05.032 --> 03:24:05.700
GETTING THE INFORMATION

03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:07.134
AFTERWARDS.

03:24:07.201 --> 03:24:08.269
DOESN'T REALLY HELP.

03:24:08.336 --> 03:24:10.304
SECOND AREA ARE REALLY HIGH IN

03:24:10.371 --> 03:24:12.440
COMPLICATED DRUGS I'M SURE MANY

03:24:12.506 --> 03:24:13.307
OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE ADS FOR K.

03:24:13.374 --> 03:24:16.377
TRUDA WHICH IS A VERY COMPLEX.

03:24:16.444 --> 03:24:18.446
IMMUNOMODULATOR DRUG THAT IS

03:24:18.512 --> 03:24:20.581
USED AS A PRIMARY TREATMENT FOR

03:24:20.648 --> 03:24:23.084
SOME CANCERS BUT OVERALL VERY

03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:25.720
GENERALLY AS A FINAL TREATMENT

03:24:25.786 --> 03:24:27.088
FOR CANCERS THAT ARE NOT

03:24:27.154 --> 03:24:28.789
RESPONDING NORMAL CHEMOTHERAPY.

03:24:28.856 --> 03:24:30.558
YOU HAVE TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE

03:24:30.625 --> 03:24:31.926
IT'S THE RIGHT PRESCRIBER.

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:33.494
THAT IT'S THE RIGHT MEDICINE FOR

03:24:33.561 --> 03:24:34.662
THE RIGHT PERSON THAT IS AN

03:24:34.729 --> 03:24:36.464
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG VERY

03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:37.798
EFFECTIVE AND IN THE RIGHT

03:24:37.865 --> 03:24:39.400
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO AGAIN

03:24:39.467 --> 03:24:40.768
THAT'S GOT TO BE IN THE MOMENT

03:24:40.835 --> 03:24:42.303
THAT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT WITH THAT

03:24:42.370 --> 03:24:43.871
PRESCRIPTION HITS THE SYSTEM.

03:24:43.938 --> 03:24:45.106
AND THAT WOULD BE A PRIOR AUTH

03:24:45.172 --> 03:24:48.009
REQUIRED DRUG THAT WE THEN MAKE

03:24:48.075 --> 03:24:49.276
SURE THAT IT IS.

03:24:49.343 --> 03:24:50.344
PROBABLY A TERTIARY LEVEL ON

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:51.779
COLLEGES THAT YOU KNOW

03:24:51.846 --> 03:24:54.015
UNIVERSITY BASED SYSTEM BECAUSE

03:24:54.081 --> 03:24:55.449
TO ME THAT DRUG NEEDS TO BE USED

03:24:55.516 --> 03:24:57.218
FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE SO WE DO A

03:24:57.284 --> 03:24:59.353
LOT OF CLINICAL WORK RIGHT AT

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:00.488
THE TIME OF THE PRESCRIPTION.

03:25:00.554 --> 03:25:02.289
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO

03:25:02.356 --> 03:25:03.557
PROTECT OUR MEMBERS --

03:25:03.624 --> 03:25:05.459
IN TERMS OF RIGHT RIGHT MEMBER

03:25:05.526 --> 03:25:10.431
RIGHT PRESCRIBER RIGHT DRUG.

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:10.998
JENNIFER CAN'T MENTIONED IS

03:25:11.065 --> 03:25:14.301
ACTUALLY FOR DIFFERENTLY.

03:25:14.368 --> 03:25:16.737
BUT AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY

03:25:16.804 --> 03:25:19.440
PRESCRIBING HABSI DRUGS ABOUT

03:25:19.507 --> 03:25:20.074
FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:25:20.141 --> 03:25:20.708
FOR THE TREATMENT.

03:25:20.775 --> 03:25:22.176
BY THE WAY QUE TRUTH AS A

03:25:22.243 --> 03:25:23.344
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

03:25:23.411 --> 03:25:24.845
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE TREATMENT.

03:25:24.912 --> 03:25:26.147
YOU WANT THAT DRUG TO BE

03:25:26.213 --> 03:25:27.348
PRESCRIBED IN ONE OF OUR CENTERS

03:25:27.415 --> 03:25:28.949
OF EXCELLENCE WHICH ARE TO

03:25:29.016 --> 03:25:31.285
COUNTY HOSPITALS LOMA LINDA OR

YOU WANT THAT DRUG AND THAT CARE

03:25:36.123 --> 03:25:37.825
BEING DELIVERED AND THE ONLY WAY

03:25:37.892 --> 03:25:38.893
TO DO THAT IS IF WE HAVE THE

03:25:38.959 --> 03:25:40.728
INFORMATION RIGHT AT THE POINT

03:25:40.795 --> 03:25:42.063
OF THE PRESCRIPTION.

03:25:42.129 --> 03:25:44.365
THIRD AREA DIABETES WE HAVE --

03:25:44.432 --> 03:25:45.933
CENTER STONE IS WHAT WAS ON OUR

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:46.934
BOARD WE HAVE A PAY FOR

03:25:47.001 --> 03:25:48.202
PERFORMANCE PROGRAM FOR

03:25:48.269 --> 03:25:49.036
PHARMACIES.

03:25:49.103 --> 03:25:51.672
WHERE THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED

03:25:51.739 --> 03:25:53.374
WITH THE DIABETIC MEMBERS COMING

03:25:53.441 --> 03:25:55.876
INTO THE PHARMACY AROUND ARE THE

03:25:55.943 --> 03:25:57.812
ON THE RIGHT MEDICATIONS TO THE

03:25:57.878 --> 03:25:59.447
NEED TO CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN?

03:25:59.513 --> 03:26:01.348
OR THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR THE

03:26:01.415 --> 03:26:03.150
DIABETES SO AGAIN IT'S GOT A

03:26:03.217 --> 03:26:04.719
WORKER AT THE TIME OF THE

03:26:04.785 --> 03:26:05.352
PRESCRIPTION.

03:26:05.419 --> 03:26:07.288
SO THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT

03:26:07.354 --> 03:26:08.823
WE ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF VERY

03:26:08.889 --> 03:26:10.791
CLINICAL WORK AROUND THE

03:26:10.858 --> 03:26:12.093
PHARMACY BENEFIT.

03:26:12.159 --> 03:26:13.928
AND I HAVE TO SAY IS A POSITION

03:26:13.994 --> 03:26:15.496
I SEE THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AS

03:26:15.563 --> 03:26:16.764
PART AND PARCEL OF DELIVERING

03:26:16.831 --> 03:26:18.132
HEALTHCARE TORE ONE POINT TWO

03:26:18.199 --> 03:26:19.633
FOUR MILLION MEMBERS. TO THE

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:21.068
IDEA THAT YOU COULD PULL IT OUT

03:26:21.135 --> 03:26:23.804
AND DO IT SEPARATELY. TO ME I'M

03:26:23.871 --> 03:26:24.972

I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

03:38:31.198 --> 03:38:33.366
QUESTIONS OUT THERE --

03:38:33.433 --> 03:38:35.969
AND SAID OF C. DRUG --

03:38:36.036 --> 03:38:38.605
DELIVERY AND ACCESS IS.

03:38:38.672 --> 03:38:40.340
OCCASIONS SAYS THIS OF A COMPLEX

03:38:40.407 --> 03:38:43.109
SO -- OR TWO

03:38:43.176 --> 03:38:44.211
IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

03:38:44.277 --> 03:38:45.679
HEARINGS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S

03:38:45.745 --> 03:38:46.680
GOING TO HAPPEN THE THREE FORTY

03:38:46.746 --> 03:38:48.014
BE -- IF

03:38:48.081 --> 03:38:49.049
THERE ARE GOING TO BE --

03:38:49.115 --> 03:38:51.284
DECREASES AND AND AND FUNDING

03:38:51.351 --> 03:38:53.954
THERE HOW WE BACK FILLING THAT --

03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:56.223
WE NEED TO LOOK AT SAID NOT ALL

03:38:56.289 --> 03:38:58.258
THE MEDICATIONS AS WE GO THROUGH

03:38:58.325 --> 03:39:00.393
A AN OUTPATIENT PHARMACY WE HAVE

03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:01.495
FIGURE OUT MEDICATIONS BECAUSE

03:39:01.561 --> 03:39:02.929
IT FACILITIES PROVIDER PROVIDED.

03:39:02.996 --> 03:39:04.531
AND OF COURSE --

03:39:04.598 --> 03:39:06.700
IN SOME SENSES --

03:39:06.766 --> 03:39:08.568
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUT THIS

03:39:08.635 --> 03:39:10.203
IS ALL THIS COULD DEAL WITH ON A

03:39:10.270 --> 03:39:10.837
RESULT IN A BACKWARD STEP IN

03:39:10.904 --> 03:39:12.539
TERMS OF ACTUALLY COORDINATION

03:39:12.606 --> 03:39:15.342
OF CARE AND AND VALUE BASED

03:39:15.408 --> 03:39:17.010
PURCHASING APPROACHES WHICH IS

03:39:17.077 --> 03:39:18.445
REALLY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO

03:39:18.512 --> 03:39:19.880
REALLY BEND OUT COST CURVE.

03:39:19.946 --> 03:39:23.683
LONG RUN AND SO --

03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:26.786
YOU KNOW --

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:28.788
IS A DOG THESE PHARMACEUTICALS

03:39:28.855 --> 03:39:30.524
WORK THEY ACTUALLY NAM THEY'VE

03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:31.291
BEEN TESTED THEY'VE BEEN

03:39:31.358 --> 03:39:32.092
APPROVED BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY

03:39:32.158 --> 03:39:32.826
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

03:39:32.893 --> 03:39:33.660
SO -- THAT

03:39:33.727 --> 03:39:34.895
MEANS THAT ANY SORT OF SYSTEM

03:39:34.961 --> 03:39:38.265
YOU CREATE TO BETTER MANAGE CARE --

03:39:38.331 --> 03:39:40.500
IF THEY'RE CARVED OUT --

03:39:40.567 --> 03:39:41.868
AND THEY'RE NOT CORNING WITH THE

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:44.337
REST OF THE PIECES THAT YOU KNOW

03:39:44.404 --> 03:39:45.372
THAT ABOUT THIS THAT --

03:39:45.438 --> 03:39:46.540
I'LL PROVIDERS THAT FACILITIES

03:39:46.606 --> 03:39:47.607
ETCETERA THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:39:47.674 --> 03:39:48.775
GET THE KIND OF RESULTS WE NEED

03:39:48.842 --> 03:39:50.243
SO I APPRECIATE THE RESENTATION

03:39:50.310 --> 03:39:53.513
FROM -- FROM

03:39:53.580 --> 03:39:56.983
HEALTH PLAN ABOUT GONNA

03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:58.385
AFFECTIVELY USE.

03:39:58.451 --> 03:39:59.252
MEDICATION --

03:39:59.319 --> 03:40:00.820
THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THE MIX

03:40:00.887 --> 03:40:02.389
AND IN FACT ACTUALLY FROM A

03:40:02.455 --> 03:40:03.423
VALUE BASED PURCHASING POINT OF

03:40:03.490 --> 03:40:04.024
VIEW.

03:40:04.090 --> 03:40:06.626
WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANY AS MUCH

03:40:06.693 --> 03:40:07.627
AS EVERYONE'S ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU

03:40:07.694 --> 03:40:08.662
KNOW THE CONCERNED ABOUT

03:40:08.728 --> 03:40:10.263
PHARMACEUTICAL CLASS WE CAN'T

03:40:10.330 --> 03:40:11.932
NESTLE SEPARATE THAT OUT FROM

03:40:11.998 --> 03:40:13.199
EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN WE HAVE

03:40:13.266 --> 03:40:14.768
TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE GET THE

03:40:14.834 --> 03:40:16.169
BEST VALUE OVER ALL.

03:40:16.236 --> 03:40:18.872
RIGHT -- SO --

03:40:18.939 --> 03:40:21.508
CERTAINLY I THINK WHEN WE LOOK

03:40:21.575 --> 03:40:23.643
AT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES YOU

03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:24.411
KNOW IN ISOLATION THERE'S

03:40:24.477 --> 03:40:25.412
CERTAINLY A LOT OF EXAMPLES WE

03:40:25.478 --> 03:40:26.446
CAN GIVE WHERE THERE ARE

03:40:26.513 --> 03:40:27.847
CHALLENGES WHERE --

03:40:27.914 --> 03:40:29.816
PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE

03:40:29.883 --> 03:40:31.318
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT

03:40:31.384 --> 03:40:32.419
THAT YOU HAVE PATIENTS WHO NEED

03:40:32.485 --> 03:40:34.921
THESE MEDICATIONS AND AND OF THE

03:40:34.988 --> 03:40:35.722
RAISE PRICES.

03:40:35.789 --> 03:40:37.757
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE

03:40:37.824 --> 03:40:40.961
THAT -- THAT

03:40:41.027 --> 03:40:43.296
SOMETIMES --

03:40:43.363 --> 03:40:44.497
ACTUALLY TO LOWER THE

03:40:44.564 --> 03:40:45.732
UTILIZATION OF OTHER TYPES OF

03:40:45.799 --> 03:40:47.767
SERVICES AS WELL AND THAT --

03:40:47.834 --> 03:40:49.269
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE

03:40:49.336 --> 03:40:51.638
HOW TO CREATE A STRUCTURE WHERE --

03:40:51.705 --> 03:40:52.772
THOSE TRADEOFFS --

03:40:52.839 --> 03:40:54.541
END UP WITH A NET LOWER COSTS

03:40:54.608 --> 03:40:56.142
FOR THE PATIENT RIGHT I MEAN AND

03:40:56.209 --> 03:40:57.577
THAT'S IN THE END AS IS WHAT

03:40:57.644 --> 03:40:59.446
IT'S ABOUT IS ABOUT WHAT THE

03:40:59.512 --> 03:41:00.513
PATIENTS HAVE TO PAY.

03:41:00.580 --> 03:41:01.615
TO RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

03:41:01.681 --> 03:41:02.983
WHAT'S THE PRICE RATE IT'S

03:41:03.049 --> 03:41:04.217
ACTUALLY WHAT THE PATIENTS HAVE

03:41:04.284 --> 03:41:05.819
TO PAY SO --

03:41:05.885 --> 03:41:07.087
YOU CAN HAVE A LOWER PRICE BUT

03:41:07.153 --> 03:41:08.154
IF YOU A MECHANISM THAT EITHER

03:41:08.221 --> 03:41:10.390
DENIES THE PATIENT ACCESS OR

03:41:10.457 --> 03:41:11.558
THAT ACTUALLY RAISES THEIR OUT

03:41:11.625 --> 03:41:12.892
OF POCKET COSTS THAN THAT'S NOT

03:41:12.959 --> 03:41:14.260
HELPING THE PATIENT EITHER.

03:41:14.327 --> 03:41:15.295
AND NOW THAT'S LESS OF AN ISSUE

03:41:15.362 --> 03:41:16.663
IN MEDI CAL LAWYER --

03:41:16.730 --> 03:41:17.931
THERE'S A BUT I MEAN THAT'S

03:41:17.998 --> 03:41:19.165
AGAIN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT

03:41:19.232 --> 03:41:20.133
HOW THAT STRUCTURE OVERALL

03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:21.801
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE SOME OF

03:41:21.868 --> 03:41:23.503
THE EFFECTS MAY AFFECT ALSO NOT

03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:24.971
JUST PATIENTS A MEDI CAL BUT

03:41:25.038 --> 03:41:26.106
OTHER PEOPLE USE SIMILAR

03:41:26.172 --> 03:41:27.440
FACILITIES I THINK WAS POINTED

03:41:27.507 --> 03:41:29.309
OUT BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION.

03:41:29.376 --> 03:41:31.077
SO I LOOK FORWARD I APPRECIATE

03:41:31.144 --> 03:41:32.379
THAT -- THAT

03:41:32.445 --> 03:41:33.046
THAT ARE --

03:41:33.113 --> 03:41:34.314
DIRECTOR DIRECTED THAT THE

03:41:34.381 --> 03:41:35.682

IN THE AUDIENCE.

03:41:36.816 --> 03:41:41.855
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING --

03:41:41.921 --> 03:41:44.224
SUBCOMMITTEE AND SO I KNOW

03:41:44.290 --> 03:41:45.058
THERE'S A STILL A LOT OF THINGS

03:41:45.125 --> 03:41:46.259
TO WORK ABOUT --

03:41:46.326 --> 03:41:49.262

03:41:52.932 --> 03:41:55.435
RESOLVED MOVING FORWARD.

AND I WANT TO SPEAK ACTUALLY --

03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:22.696
TO NOT THE MEDI CAL PIECE OF IT

03:42:22.762 --> 03:42:24.898
BUT TO THE STATE AND PRIVATE

03:42:24.964 --> 03:42:26.032
PURCHASERS.

03:42:26.099 --> 03:42:28.234
THERE ARE SEVENTEEN MILLION

03:42:28.301 --> 03:42:30.170
CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE JOB BASED

03:42:30.236 --> 03:42:31.638
COVERAGE SIX MILLION OF THOSE

03:42:31.705 --> 03:42:34.374

03:42:34.441 --> 03:42:36.509
WHERE THEIR EMPLOYER OR TRUST

FUND PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS?

03:42:39.112 --> 03:42:41.915
AND THIS IS A HUGE COST BOTH TO

03:42:41.981 --> 03:42:43.717
CONSUMERS TO WORKERS AND TO THE

03:42:43.783 --> 03:42:46.419

ACCOUNTED 4405% OF THEIR PREMIUM

03:42:53.126 --> 03:42:54.794
RATE INCREASES --

03:42:54.861 --> 03:42:56.996
A HUGE COST TO BOTH THE STATE

03:42:57.063 --> 03:42:58.565
AND TO TWO MEMBERS.

03:42:58.631 --> 03:43:02.869

THAT THERE COULD BE.

03:43:09.142 --> 03:43:11.911

03:43:36.669 --> 03:43:38.438
POTENTIALS --

03:43:38.505 --> 03:43:40.440
TO BE THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF ALL

03:43:40.507 --> 03:43:41.641
PURCHASERS IN THE STATE OF

TRANSPARENCY --

03:44:00.727 --> 03:44:02.662
LAW WHERE DRUG COMPANIES

03:44:02.729 --> 03:44:04.130
ACTUALLY HAVE TO REPORT AND GIVE

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:06.499
A JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR

BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:44:56.049 --> 03:44:57.283
AREAS THIS PROVIDES AN

03:44:57.350 --> 03:44:59.185
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE.

03:44:59.252 --> 03:45:01.521

03:50:59.312 --> 03:51:01.180
POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THREE FORTY

03:51:01.247 --> 03:51:02.281
PROVIDERS.

03:51:02.348 --> 03:51:04.116
THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

CALIFORNIA FOR SOMEONE ALIGN

03:51:08.788 --> 03:51:09.922
MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS

03:51:09.989 --> 03:51:11.357
MICHELLE GIVENS MADE --

03:51:11.424 --> 03:51:12.458
ABOUT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT

03:51:12.525 --> 03:51:14.026
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DO WITH

03:51:14.093 --> 03:51:14.927
THEIR FUNDING.

03:51:14.994 --> 03:51:16.696
AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION ABOUT

03:51:16.762 --> 03:51:18.831
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG --

03:51:18.898 --> 03:51:21.534
COSTS THAT WE WERE THRILLED WHEN

03:51:21.601 --> 03:51:22.168
THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES

03:51:22.235 --> 03:51:24.637
ASKED US WHAT DRUGS ARE THE MOST

03:51:24.704 --> 03:51:26.305
EXPENSIVE TO US THAT THEY CAN BE

03:51:26.372 --> 03:51:27.273
INCLUDED.

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:28.808
IN THE LIST BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

03:51:28.874 --> 03:51:30.276
ADD THAT ANOTHER IMPORTANT

03:51:30.343 --> 03:51:32.311
COMPONENT IS THE DRUGS ACOSTA

03:51:32.378 --> 03:51:33.613
ZERO BECAUSE WE'RE THERE TOO

03:51:33.679 --> 03:51:35.181
EXPENSIVE FOR US TO EVEN BY.

03:51:35.248 --> 03:51:37.116
THE ONES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:51:37.183 --> 03:51:38.251
BE ABLE TO AFFORD.

03:51:38.317 --> 03:51:40.753
A KEY EXAMPLE OF THAT IS ADULT

03:51:40.820 --> 03:51:42.255
IMMUNIZATIONS THAT WE WOULD LOVE

03:51:42.321 --> 03:51:44.624
OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO HAVE

03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:45.625
IN THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE

03:51:45.691 --> 03:51:47.326
PATIENTS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

03:51:47.393 --> 03:51:48.561
RECEIVE AN IMMUNIZATION IF IT'S

03:51:48.628 --> 03:51:50.029
RIGHT THERE --

03:51:50.096 --> 03:51:51.197
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PURCHASE

03:51:51.264 --> 03:51:53.299
OF OTHER WAYS AND IT'S DIFFICULT

03:51:53.366 --> 03:51:55.735
FOR PROVIDERS TO KEEP THOSE IN

03:51:55.801 --> 03:51:58.070

03:52:11.083 --> 03:52:12.818
WAY IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE

03:52:12.885 --> 03:52:14.120
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

03:52:14.186 --> 03:52:15.655

PERSON TO TESTIFY WE DO BELIEVE

03:52:34.774 --> 03:52:35.708
THAT GENERIC ABOUT SIMILAR TO

03:52:35.775 --> 03:52:37.076
OUR LARGE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE

03:52:37.143 --> 03:52:39.245
AND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S.

03:52:39.312 --> 03:52:43.749
GOAL TO REDUCE PATIENT CO.

03:52:43.816 --> 03:52:45.217
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF POINTS I'D

03:52:45.284 --> 03:52:45.918
I'D I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU

03:52:45.985 --> 03:52:48.587
WITH. 90% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS

03:52:48.654 --> 03:52:50.423
WRITTEN ARE FORTUNATE --

03:52:50.489 --> 03:52:53.059
DRUGS ONLY 23% OF THE REVENUE

03:52:53.125 --> 03:52:54.226
RESULTS FROM.

03:52:54.293 --> 03:52:56.962
THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND TWENTY

03:52:57.029 --> 03:52:57.897
SEVENTEEN GENERIC DRUGS SAY THE

03:52:57.963 --> 03:53:00.132
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY THREE

03:53:00.199 --> 03:53:01.233
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:02.601
IT'S FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION A

03:53:02.668 --> 03:53:04.503
MEDICAID SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION

03:53:04.570 --> 03:53:05.738
A MEDICARE.

03:53:05.805 --> 03:53:07.973
AND THE THE REST IN COMMERCIALLY

03:53:08.040 --> 03:53:08.674
INSURED AND CASH PAYING

03:53:08.741 --> 03:53:10.710
[inaudible]CUSTOMERS.

03:53:10.776 --> 03:53:12.912
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

03:53:12.978 --> 03:53:14.246
BRAND MARKET PLACE IN THE CHIN

03:53:14.313 --> 03:53:15.247
GENERIC MARKETPLACE ARE VERY

03:53:15.314 --> 03:53:16.849
STARK.

03:53:16.916 --> 03:53:19.819
WE SELL ON A VERY NATIONAL LEVEL

03:53:19.885 --> 03:53:21.921
THERE'S THREE PURCHASERS THAT BY

03:53:21.987 --> 03:53:23.989
90% OF ALL GENERIC DRUGS THOSE

03:53:24.056 --> 03:53:25.458
ARE THE THREE WHOLESALERS AFTER

03:53:25.524 --> 03:53:27.193
THAT THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS

03:53:27.259 --> 03:53:29.829
ARE VERY LARGELY OUT OF THE COST

03:53:29.895 --> 03:53:31.964
STRUCTURE THAT CONTINUES

03:53:32.031 --> 03:53:32.498
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE

03:53:32.565 --> 03:53:33.699
SUPPLY CHAIN.

03:53:33.766 --> 03:53:35.968
IN FACT MANUFACTURES TAKE IN THE

03:53:36.035 --> 03:53:37.570
GENERIC SPACE ABOUT ONE THIRD.

03:53:37.636 --> 03:53:39.238
OF THE REVENUE WHILE THE REST

03:53:39.305 --> 03:53:40.740
THE SUPPLY CHAIN TAKES TWO

03:53:40.806 --> 03:53:41.807
THIRDS.

03:53:41.874 --> 03:53:42.808
THE DIFFERENCE ON THE BRAND SITE

03:53:42.875 --> 03:53:44.243
IS THE BRAND MANUFACTURERS TAKE

03:53:44.310 --> 03:53:47.646
ABOUT 75% OF THE REVENUE AND THE

03:53:47.713 --> 03:53:48.247
REST SPREAD ACROSS THE SUPPLY

03:53:48.314 --> 03:53:49.348
CHAIN.

03:53:49.415 --> 03:53:50.416
THE GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

03:53:50.483 --> 03:53:52.785
SPACES ABOUT THE ONLY DECLINING.

03:53:52.852 --> 03:53:55.154
SPACE WITH IN HEALTH CARE WERE

03:53:55.221 --> 03:53:58.824
DECLINING AT ABOUT 7% ANNUALLY.

03:53:58.891 --> 03:54:01.026
I THINK FIVE EARLIER SB

03:54:01.093 --> 03:54:01.694
SEVENTEEN WAS WAS BROUGHT UP AND

03:54:01.761 --> 03:54:02.595
I THINK SOME VERY INTERESTING

03:54:02.661 --> 03:54:04.597
POINTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED

03:54:04.663 --> 03:54:06.799
FROM THAT BILL OF THE TWENTY

03:54:06.866 --> 03:54:07.933
FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED

03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:09.001
GENERIC DRUGS.

03:54:09.068 --> 03:54:10.970
THEY COMPRISE THIRTY NINE POINT

03:54:11.036 --> 03:54:12.605
9% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS FOUR

03:54:12.671 --> 03:54:14.240
POINT 8%.

03:54:14.306 --> 03:54:16.442
OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPEND AN ONLY

03:54:16.509 --> 03:54:18.344
POINT 3%.

03:54:18.411 --> 03:54:23.416
OF THE PREMIUM FOR TWENTY FIVE

03:54:23.482 --> 03:54:24.717
HIGHEST PER YEAR.

03:54:24.784 --> 03:54:25.918
A YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASED

03:54:25.985 --> 03:54:27.686
GENERIC DRUGS RESULTED IN ONLY

03:54:27.753 --> 03:54:29.121
FOUR POINT 7% OF THE TOTAL DRUG

03:54:29.188 --> 03:54:30.055
SPENT.

03:54:30.122 --> 03:54:31.624
AND YES THERE ARE SOME VERY

03:54:31.690 --> 03:54:33.492
EXPENSIVE GENERIC DRUGS I DON'T

03:54:33.559 --> 03:54:35.194
WANT -- TO

03:54:35.261 --> 03:54:37.329
DOWNPLAYS FAT FACT.

03:54:37.396 --> 03:54:39.465
THE FINAL POINT THAT CAME OUT OF

03:54:39.532 --> 03:54:41.467
THE THE DRUG LISTA REQUIRED FROM

03:54:41.534 --> 03:54:42.201
THE INFORMATION FROM THE

03:54:42.268 --> 03:54:44.003
INSURERS SUPPORT FOR THE TWENTY

03:54:44.069 --> 03:54:46.338
FIVE MOST COSTLY GENERIC DRUGS.

03:54:46.405 --> 03:54:48.808
SO RESULTED IN 25% OF ALL

03:54:48.874 --> 03:54:49.642
PRESCRIPTIONS.

03:54:49.708 --> 03:54:52.511
BELOW 8% OF THE TOTAL DRUG SPEND

03:54:52.578 --> 03:54:54.847
AND LESS THAN 1% OF HEALTHCARE

03:54:54.914 --> 03:54:58.150
PREMIUMS.

03:54:58.217 --> 03:55:00.219
THE CENTER FOR CMS NATIONAL

03:55:00.286 --> 03:55:04.790
HEALTH EXPENDITURE DATA FROM --

03:55:04.857 --> 03:55:05.691
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWS THAT

03:55:05.758 --> 03:55:07.193
HOSPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED

03:55:07.259 --> 03:55:08.594
BY FOUR POINT 6% TO

03:55:08.661 --> 03:55:09.762
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE

03:55:09.829 --> 03:55:11.063
TRILLION DOLLARS.

03:55:11.130 --> 03:55:12.531
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE PRIOR

03:55:12.598 --> 03:55:14.066
YEAR WAS A FIVE POINT 6%

03:55:14.133 --> 03:55:15.167
INCREASE.

03:55:15.234 --> 03:55:16.869
POSITIONING CLINICAL SERVICES

03:55:16.936 --> 03:55:18.270
INCREASED FOUR POINT 2% TO

03:55:18.337 --> 03:55:19.805
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED

03:55:19.872 --> 03:55:21.307
BILLION DOLLARS ALSO GOOD

03:55:21.373 --> 03:55:22.808
BECAUSE THAT'S REDUCTION FROM

03:55:22.875 --> 03:55:24.443
FIVE POINT 6%.

03:55:24.510 --> 03:55:27.046
THE PRIOR YEAR PRESCRIPTION DRUG

03:55:27.112 --> 03:55:27.980
SPEND INCREASED.

03:55:28.047 --> 03:55:31.917
POINT 4%. TWO THREE HUNDRED

03:55:31.984 --> 03:55:32.485
THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS

03:55:32.551 --> 03:55:33.152
AGAIN THESE ARE CMS.

03:55:33.219 --> 03:55:35.221
NUMBERS.

03:55:35.287 --> 03:55:37.056
THEY CREDITED LARGELY THE

03:55:37.122 --> 03:55:39.258
GENERIC DRUG SPACE FOR ENSURING

03:55:39.325 --> 03:55:41.060
THAT LOW.

03:55:41.126 --> 03:55:43.796
INCREASE POINT 4%.

03:55:43.863 --> 03:55:46.131
REGARDING THE PURCHASING POOL AS

03:55:46.198 --> 03:55:47.766
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR.

03:55:47.833 --> 03:55:50.202
AM DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION ON

03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:51.637
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN

03:55:51.704 --> 03:55:52.905
BECAUSE MOST GENERICS ARE.

03:55:52.972 --> 03:55:55.174
SOLD TO THE THREE WHOLESALERS

03:55:55.241 --> 03:55:57.510
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND

03:55:57.576 --> 03:55:58.978
IT'S KIND OF A LONG RANGE

03:55:59.044 --> 03:56:00.212
CONCERNED WITH THIS TYPE OF

03:56:00.279 --> 03:56:02.248
THING AND WHEN WE'VE SEEN THIS --

03:56:02.314 --> 03:56:03.983
GROWTH FROM STATE TO STATE TO

03:56:04.049 --> 03:56:05.017
THE NATIONAL LEVEL [inaudible]

03:56:05.084 --> 03:56:09.588
AND THE CONCERN IS AS YOU START

03:56:09.655 --> 03:56:11.123
TO GROW THE PURCHASING POOLS.

03:56:11.190 --> 03:56:12.258
THAT MEANS YOU'RE ELIMINATING

03:56:12.324 --> 03:56:13.859
THE NUMBER OF PURCHASERS WHEN

03:56:13.926 --> 03:56:15.227
YOU ELIMINATE THE NUMBER OF

03:56:15.294 --> 03:56:17.429
PURCHASERS YOU'RE ELIMINATING A

03:56:17.496 --> 03:56:19.331
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

03:56:19.398 --> 03:56:19.999
SALES.

03:56:20.065 --> 03:56:21.133
WHEN YOU LIMóN EIGHT THE TOTAL

03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:22.868
NUMBER OF SALES THAT MEANS THAT

03:56:22.935 --> 03:56:23.802
THERE'S NOT AS MANY

03:56:23.869 --> 03:56:25.971
MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE GOING TO

03:56:26.038 --> 03:56:28.240
BE MAKING THOSE SALES?

03:56:28.307 --> 03:56:29.108
AND SO THAT STARTS TO NARROW.

03:56:29.174 --> 03:56:32.511
THE XIN ROUTE AND IT'S THE

03:56:32.578 --> 03:56:34.046
COMPETITION WITHIN THE GENERIC

03:56:34.113 --> 03:56:36.582
SPACE THAT DRIVE DOWN PRICES.

03:56:36.649 --> 03:56:37.650
AND SO.

03:56:37.716 --> 03:56:39.518
AGAIN IT'S IT'S NOT ANY SORT OF

03:56:39.585 --> 03:56:41.520
OPPOSITION BUT JUST A THOUGHT TO

03:56:41.587 --> 03:56:42.254
LEAVE YOU WITH.

03:56:42.321 --> 03:56:43.022
THAT.

03:56:43.088 --> 03:56:44.690
THERE ARE SOME LONG RANGE

03:56:44.757 --> 03:56:46.759
CONCERNS THAT I THINK NEED TO BE.

03:56:46.825 --> 03:56:48.827
CONTEMPLATED AS THIS TYPE OF A

03:56:48.894 --> 03:56:50.162
PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD.

03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:51.397

A IMPORTANT FIRST CONVERSATION

03:57:00.839 --> 03:57:02.875
ABOUT SOME MAJOR --

03:57:02.942 --> 03:57:04.410
