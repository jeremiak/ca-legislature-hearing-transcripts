AS MISPRINT AN OUTLINE THERE'S

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:20.719
KIND OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:21.353
THE GOVERNOR SHORT TERM HOUSING

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.421
PRODUCTION PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:24.723
TO CREATE THESE NEW SHORT TERM

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:25.824
HOUSING PRODUCTION TARGETS AND

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.225

FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

PLAN TO MEET TO SET ASIDE A FIVE

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.797
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR POT FOR

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.366
INCENTIVE REWARDS.

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.167
WE HAVE CONCERNS ON BOTH OF

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:38.670
THESE PIECES OF OF THE PROPOSAL

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.372
FIRST ON THE ON THE PART ABOUT

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:41.740
CREATING SHORT TERM HOUSING

00:25:41.806 --> 00:25:43.174
PRODUCTION GOALS --

00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:44.342
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:46.111
HAD A STRATEGY OF OF CREATING

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:48.380
STATE DEFINED HOUSING TARGETS

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:49.581
FOR COMMUNITIES AND ASKING IN

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.016
THE PLAN FOR THEM FOR SEVERAL

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.150
DECADES.

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.251
THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT AND

00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:54.386
REASON A HOUSING NEEDS

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:55.987
ALLOCATION ARENA PROCESS --

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.023
AN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND WORK BY

00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:00.392
OUR OFFICE HAS GENERALLY FOUND

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:01.927
OF THAT THAT THAT THAT PROCESS

00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:03.461
HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN A

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:06.064
STIMULATING HOUSING PRODUCTION.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.899
ON HELPING TO MAKE THIS A

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.668
MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO LOCAL

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.670
ZONING LAWS THAT FACILITATE A

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.138
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT --

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:14.639
BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK IT

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.074
WOULD BE THOSE SO YOUR WOULD BE

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.108
BETTER OFF.

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:18.510
NOT FOCUSING ON THE SHORT TERM

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.445
GOALS BUT INSTEAD CONTINUING ON

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.280
THE WORK IN THE EFFORTS IT'S

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:22.948
BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST COUPLE

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:23.748
YEARS.

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:25.016
AND LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REFORM

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:28.019
AND IMPROVE THE STATE'S EXISTING.

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:32.190
STRUCTURE FOR LONG TERM PLANNING.

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.158
ON THE FIVE IN A MILLION DOLLAR

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.526
FOR INCENTIVE GRANTS.

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:36.528
OF THE WE'VE WE THINK THAT THIS

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:38.330
WOULD BE A A RISKY BET FROM THE

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:39.831
LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE THE

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.533
STATE HAS TRIED A SIMILAR

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:42.701
APPROACHES IN THE PAST OF

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.369
SETTING ASIDE FUNDS.

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:45.670
TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES LOCAL

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:46.905
GOVERNMENTS TO ATTEMPT TO

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:47.605
ENCOURAGE THEM TO TO BUILD

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:48.807
HOUSING --

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:49.874
OUR REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:51.242
SUGGESTS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:52.877
DIDN'T --

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.347
INCREASE --

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:56.815
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T BE

00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.717
CERTAIN WHAT IT WOULD GET BY

00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.818
SETTING ASIDE THIS FIVE HUNDRED

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:00.852
MILLION.

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:01.987
IT WOULD THEREFORE BE RISKY

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:03.722
COMPARED TO ON ALTERNATIVE OF OF

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.123
FOR EXAMPLE JUST ALLOCATING THE

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.692
FUNDING FOR DIRECT SUBSIDIES FOR

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.794
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:13.498
WITH THAT I'D TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:16.901
THE QUESTIONS WE CAN MAKE MISTER.

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:17.202
LITERATURE.

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:19.437
GLORIA.

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:22.574
NO I WANTED TO FOR TO MEMBER

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.979

FOR SPONSORED LA AS COMMENTS.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:41.659
I WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:42.360
PACKAGE OVERALL TAKES A

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:42.994
COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT VARIOUS

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:43.595
FACTORS OF HOUSING INCLUDING

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:02.480
RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT I MEAN

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:03.214
FOR SOME WE GET OFF THE FROM

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.315
START IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE IT

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:05.350
ACTIVISTS GOVERNOR THE CARES

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:06.551
DEEPLY ABOUT HOUSING I WANT TO

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.286
MAKE ANY BONES ABOUT THAT --

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.421
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH I WOULD

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.655
IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH SOME OF THE

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:11.790
COMMENTS OF THE LA --

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.058
IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE

00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:14.692
DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT ARE HERE ME

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:15.593
FIVE MILLION TO FIFTY MILLION

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.394
REAL MONEY --

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:17.495
BUT WE KNOW IN TERMS OF SIZE AND

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:20.665

LONG TERM SOLUTIONS MAY BE ON

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:37.515
THAT COULD BE A BRIDGE TO LONG

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:38.383
TERM SOLUTIONS I THINK THAT'S

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.717
WHAT YOU'RE ALLUDING TO BUT NOT

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.220

WE HAVE YET TO FUND THE RENO

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.926

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:42.927
NEW REQUIREMENTS GOOD

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:44.362
REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR

THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.649
GREENHOUSE GAS OBLIGATIONS.

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.017

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.585
HOUSING MATTERS.

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.454
IF WE STILL WANT TO ACHIEVE OUR

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.755

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.857

FOR FOLKS FACED A LOT OF

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:14.252
INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS WERE

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.287
NOT NECESSARILY THE HOTTEST

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:17.889
MARKETS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT.

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:19.590
WE KIND OF THINK THERE'S A STEP

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.325
MISSING BETWEEN PLANNING AND

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.127
THEN HOUSING PRODUCTION ACTUALLY

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.595
HAPPENING SO SOMETHING THAT WE'D

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:25.430
LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH THE

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:26.764
COMMITTEE AS THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:27.932
ADVANCES.

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.233
IS THE NEED FOR REALLY

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.235
IMPLEMENTATION MONEY FOR THE

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:32.804
PLANS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED SO

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.839
WE CAN PLAN FOR HOUSING BUT IF

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:35.873
THE HARD COSTS.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.075
ARE TOO HIGH IF THE MARKET ISN'T

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:40.144
THERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR ISN'T

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.112
GOING TO COME IN AND BUILD IT

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:41.813
AND SO.

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:43.147
AS IT RELATES TO UNINCORPORATED

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:44.382
AREAS WE REALLY WANT TO BE

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.217
MINDFUL OF THAT GAP AND IF

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.952
THERE'S A WAY TO BRING RESOURCES

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.387
TO MAKE PROJECTS PENCIL THAT

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:50.721
OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.709
AS OTHER TRANSPORTATION ON

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:46.944
HOUSING DOLLARS WHICH WE HAVE

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.046
NOT YET IDENTIFIED. TO MEETING

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.448
THOSE HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS.

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:52.850
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF THERE'S

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:55.653
A HOUSING PROJECT TO THAT IS.

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:58.289
CLOSE TO TRANSPORTATION LINES

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.257
THEN THERE COULD BE MONEY TAKEN

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:04.061
FROM SB ONE FOR THAT PROJECT.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.664
IS A WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.565
WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.166
MECHANICS I DON'T KNOW THAT IT --

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.534
HOW SPECIFIC IT IS --

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:12.469
I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE HERE ON THE

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:13.604
REPRESENTS TRANSPORTATION IF HE

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.707
HAS ANYTHING BAD.

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.242
PELOSI WELLS --

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.410
FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE --

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.045
THERE'S NOT THAT WE WOULDN'T

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:22.112
LINK ANY OF THE S. ALL THE SP

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:23.080
ONE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.115
THE PURPOSES THAT IS ALREADY

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:26.016
STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO BE USED

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:26.617
SO.

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.451
THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.119
FUNDING WOULD STILL BE USED FOR

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:29.954
THE SAME LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.055
PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE NOW.

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.590
BUT THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:35.426
FUNDS WOULD BE --

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.026
WOULD THERE WOULD BE YOU KNOW

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.762
THERE'S KERN --

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.131
STATUTORY FORMULAS FOR ALL THOSE

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:42.700
FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND WE JUST

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:44.635
PROPOSED TO LOOK AT IN ADDITION

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:45.569
TO THOSE TOUCH WHAT FUNDS

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.204
SOMETHING THAT IS LINKED TO THE

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.372
PRODUCTION OF HOUSING UNITS BUT

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.440
FUNDS THEMSELVES WOULD STILL

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:51.108
JUST BE FOR THE LOCAL STREETS

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:51.742
AND ROADS PROCOPE.

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.310
KILLING ME JUST ASK ONE MORE

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.612
CLARIFICATION.

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:55.646
JUST BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:56.947
I'M UNDERSTANDING THE THOUGHT

00:41:57.014 --> 00:42:00.651
PROCESS SO.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:01.418
THE THE MONEY THAT'S ALREADY

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.387
ALLOCATED TO INDIVIDUAL CITIES

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.956
BY FOUR FORMULA WOULD CONTINUE

00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:07.691
TO BE --

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:10.294
GIVEN TO EACH CITY AS ALREADY

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.062
THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO FOR

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:15.299
MAJOR PROJECTS LIKE FREEWAYS AND

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.167
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MONEY WOULD

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:19.503
GO TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.604
ALLOCATED.

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.106
BUT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER PART

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:23.941
OF A POT OF MONEY IF YOU WANT TO

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.377
SAY THAT COULD BE GIVEN IF

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:27.845
CITIES ARE.

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.280
ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:32.182
TRANSPORTATION SLASH HOUSING.

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.717
WILL THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:34.919
THAT YOU KNOW DELIBERATION BACK

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.287
AND FORTH OF ZACHARY HOW TO

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.756
APPLY BUT THE IDEA IS THAT.

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.291
CITIES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THAT

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.192
WHATEVER HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.560
MONEY LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.796
THAT IS DETERMINED OR OTHER

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.997
PROGRAMS I THERE'S LOCAL

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.399
PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS OR SEVERAL

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:49.833
DIFFERENT SB ONE POTS.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.735
THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD STILL BE

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:53.404
USED FOR THE SAME HIGH --

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.538
PROJECTS IN THE IN THE CASE

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:55.372
ILLUSTRATES ROADS NOT HIGHWAY

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:56.507
PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE.

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:57.374
ESSENTIALLY --

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.143
IN A LOCAL PROJECTS OF STREET

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.345
REPAIR THAT'S THE THING BUT THE

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:04.281
THE FACTORS BY WHICH THE AMOUNT

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.416
THAT IS --

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:10.087
CALCULATED OR THE THE FACTORS

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:13.123
THAT CURRENT YOU KNOW THEY'RE

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.858
THE SCO STILL THE CURRENTLY

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:15.926
PROCESSES.

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:16.894
OF LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.495
FUNDING AND A HALF AND LOCALS

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.064
MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA IN ORDER

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.498
TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS.

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:22.666
AND SO --

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.302
THERE IS DELIBERATIONS ON HOW WE

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.171
CAN INCLUDE REACHING --

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.039
LONG TERM OR MID TERM --

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.642
HOUSING GOALS AS PART OF THE US

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:32.609
FOR TERROR [inaudible]

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:35.846
THANK YOU.

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.348
BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU --

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.549
I JUST WANT TO RECAP I'M NEW SO

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:40.217
THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:41.852
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RENO

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.754
NUMBERS ARE PLANNING GOALS.

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.089
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.690
REACHING THE PRODUCTION UNITS OF

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.925
THOSE RECYCLES.

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:49.426
AND YOU'RE TRYING SB ONE THE

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.527
MONEY TO THE PRODUCTION WERE

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.997
CITIES ARE ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.431
THE PLANNING FOR IT AND SO

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:56.433
THERE'S A THERE'S A FLAW I THINK

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.334
AND NOT LOGIC.

00:43:57.401 --> 00:43:59.436
BECAUSE I I CAN UNDERSTAND

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:01.005
HOLDING BACK SB ONE MONEY IF

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.973
THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT WITH HDD I

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.408
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.676
PRODUCTION GOALS AS ALSO

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:07.144
PARTIALLY ON THE PRIVATE MARKET.

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.379
AND SO CITIES CANNOT BE

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:11.849
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MECHANISM

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.250
THE PRIVATE MARKET.

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.218
AND IT YOU YOU CORRECT AND WE WE

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:15.319
ARE VERY YOU KNOW MUCH

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.220
DIFFERENCE TO THAT THE I THINK

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:17.087
THERE ARE GOALS THERE ARE

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.355
PLANNING GOALS THERE ARE.

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:19.723
THERE ARE.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.524
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT GOALS THAT

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.227
COULD BE LOOKED AND AND

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.628
DETERMINED --

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:25.896
WHETHER YOU KNOW GOOD FAITH

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.264
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TOWARDS

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.399
HOUSING GOALS SO I THINK THAT

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.533
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.100
LIBERATION THAT'S HAPPENING

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.235
BEFORE.

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:33.637
WE DECIDE ON ANY YOU KNOW FINAL

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:34.972
NUMBERS ARE FINAL GOALS FOR WHAT

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.340
WHAT IS GOING TO BE TALLIED TO

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:40.511
DETERMINE YOU KNOW COMPLIANCE.

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.012
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE ARE

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.147
AWARE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.281
MEASURES AND ONLY CERTAIN

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.016
MEASURES THAT LOCALS CAN DO TO

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.285
AND SENT IT TO GET PRODUCTION.

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.319
MOVING AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:51.088
FOCUS ON WHAT IS IN THE CONTROL

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:52.990
OF THE CITY SOME NOTE AND I'LL

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.858
MAKE SURE THAT MAY I GO BACK AND

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:55.626
DOUBLE CHECK THE FACTS OF MY

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:56.527
STATEMENT.

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:57.761
BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IN

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.264
A LOT OF CITIES WHERE HOUSING IS

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.365
MORE DIFFICULT ONE OF THE

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.867
BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO HOUSING IS

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:05.335
TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:06.837
SO IF WE'RE TAKING AWAY THE SP

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.705
ONE MONIES FOR LOCAL ROADS WERE

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.074
BASICALLY TAKING AWAY CITIES

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.875
ABILITY TO SOLVE CRAP TRAFFIC

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.677
CONGESTION TO ACTUALLY CREATE

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:14.812
THAT HOUSING THAT'S POSSIBLE SO

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.246
LET'S BE VERY CAREFUL IN HOW WE

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:17.514
APPROACH THIS.

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.782
AND WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CITY

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:20.050
WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.286
MARKET THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA --

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:29.860
DC TENSIONER OF WHICH BUT THAT'S

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:30.761
OKAY WERE REALLY THE PROCESS

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:32.062
YOU'RE COLLECTING FEEDBACK AND I

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:33.097
THINK IT'S GOOD LISTEN THE NEED

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:34.031
TO BE SOME CARROTS AND STICKS IN

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.032
THIS ARRANGEMENT WE CAN'T

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.400
REPRESENTED EVERY CITIES A GOOD

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.000
ACTOR WE KNOW SOME OF THEM

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:37.634
AREN'T APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:38.135
TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE.

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.236
CITIES TO TO DO THE RIGHT THING --

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.437
I DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.339
ABOUT SB ONE FUNDS --

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.508
GIVEN THE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.576
VOTERS ON THIS AND AND STAYING.

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.678
TRUE TO WHAT WAS REPRESENTED TO

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:50.714
THEM ANYWHERE ELSE TO NOT BE

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.649
MISAPPROPRIATED IS JUST A

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:53.350
CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS WHEN GET IT.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.918
THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT I WOULD

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:56.587
ASK ARE YOU EXPANDING THE POTS

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.422
OF FUNDS BEYOND TRANSPORTATION

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:58.956
FUNDS --

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:02.493
SPOKE WITH INCENTIVE GRANTS --

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:03.360
THAT IT KEPT TRADE FUNDS I MEAN

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.328
ARE THERE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:05.662
THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING AS

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.231
INCENTIVES --

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:07.831
TO BE WITHHELD --

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:11.201
IF JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING THEIR

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:11.969
FAIR SHARE ON HOUSING.

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:12.703
RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE WE'RE

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:13.604
LOOKING AT JUST.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.139
ALL OF THE FUNDING SOURCES

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:16.073
AVAILABLE WHAT CAN BE TIGHTS

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.940
WERE STILL VERY IN THE

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:18.809
PRELIMINARY STAGES RIGHT NOW

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.777
WE'VE IDENTIFIED SOME SB ONE

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.513
FUNDS --

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:23.680
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE BLATANT BY

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.649
OUR ENCOURAGED TO LOOK BEYOND

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:26.250
THAT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:27.384
OF CARE IT'S AT THE STATE

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.886
PROVIDES TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS --

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.488
AND I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE AT

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:32.089
ENHANCING OR YOU KNOW OFTEN

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.257
THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO HELP

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.691
OFFSET THE THE IMPACTS OF

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.293
DIVIDENDS DEVELOPMENT --

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.027
YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.462
DOING THAT SHOULD PROBABLY

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:39.062
SHOULD HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.631
COMMUNITIES ARE NOT A SIMPLY

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:41.932
BECAUSE THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER A

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.834
CANCER PROPOSAL IF YOU CATCH MY

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:45.202
DRIFT AND MAYBE THAT SIMPLISTIC

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:46.870
OR MAY NOT EVEN FACTUAL BUT I

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:47.404
I'D LIKE YOU LOOK IN THAT

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:47.804
DIRECTION TO BE.

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:50.841
INCLUSIVE OF THAT --

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:56.280
GIVEN THE POLITICAL [inaudible]

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:58.382
YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:01.952
OKAY WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:04.321
A GOOD AFTERNOON LUIS MONTANA

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.023
BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BE.

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.357
FIGURE OUT THIS MIKE --

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:08.192
WE WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.259
PROPOSAL --

00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:09.960
ULTIMATELY HAVE --

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:10.994
SOME SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:12.663
FEEDBACK THOUGH --

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.298
ON THE ISSUE OF OF RENO TWO

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.766
POINT NOW WE'RE A LITTLE BIT FOR

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:16.900
A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL.

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.001
THAT THAT'LL BE A SUCCESSFUL

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:19.269
PROCESS ONE OF THE THE MAIN

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.237
PROBLEMS WITH TRYING

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:22.339
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS. TO RENEW

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.607
GOALS IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.808
CITIES ABOUT.

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:25.576
TWENTY FIVE THAT ACTUALLY DO

00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:26.944
MEET ALL CATEGORIES OF THEIR

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.513
VEHICLES THAT PROBABLY WOULD NOT.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.815
IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS SATISFY

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.150
THAT THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.117
THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING ON

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.419
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.753
AND THAT'S JUST AN INHERENT FLAW

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.955
OF ANYWAY THE STATE'S GOING TO

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.323
ANY TOOL THE STATE'S GONNA HAVE.

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:40.791
TO ANALYZE PRODUCTION BUT WE

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:43.427
WOULDN'T WANT FOR BILL WHICH IS

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:44.394
AFFIRMATIVELY DOING THE RIGHT

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:45.996
THING BUT NOT MEETING.

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.731
THEIR PMR RINA CATEGORIES TO BE

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.466
PUNISHED FOR THAT --

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.968
WHILE OTHER CITIES THAT ARE

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:52.035
MEETING THEIR PMR CATEGORIES

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:54.671
BECAUSE THEY'RE PMR CATEGORY IS --

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.206
ZERO GET OFF SCOT FREE THAT THAT

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.107
THE DIFFICULTY THAT WILL HAVE TO

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:57.708
APPROACH.

00:47:57.774 --> 00:47:58.976
WE WOULD ALSO KIND OF HAVE

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.244
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FEEDBACK ON

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.213
THE ON THE HOUSING DOLLARS

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:03.780
TRYING TO HOUSING DOLLARS TO

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:04.314
HOUSING GOALS.

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.216
IN IN BIG PART BECAUSE WE WANT

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:07.217
TO FOCUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:08.986
THOSE IN THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:09.620
ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.055
OPPORTUNITY TO THE BEST SCHOOLS

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:12.689
THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS THE BEST

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.590
AIR QUALITY.

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.525
AND SO TYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:16.660
DOLLARS --

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.661
TO MEETING STATE HOUSING GOALS

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.196
COULD ACTUALLY CREATE THE WRONG

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.831
INCENTIVE FOR CITIES THAT DON'T

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:21.498
WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:22.833
COMMUNITY --

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.268
ENCOURAGING THEM ACTUALLY TO BE

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.936
WORSE ON THEIR HOUSING GOALS --

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:26.737
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T GET THAT

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:27.938
HOUSE AND ALSO I THINK THERE'S

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.273
NEW WANTS THEIR THAT THE

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:31.441
ASSEMBLY IS IT IS IT WOULD IS

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.843
RIGHT TO BE CONSIDERING THERE

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.578
TOO PROPOSALS --

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:35.445
AND THE ASSEMBLY NOW THAT I

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.014
THINK ARE ARE BOB VERY WORTH

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.948
CONSIDERING --

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:39.316
FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DALY AND

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:43.387
AND CARTY --

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:44.988
IT WOULDN'T MOST OF THAT MOST OF

00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:45.589
THESE PROPOSALS ONE ACTUALLY

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.590
TAKE AWAY THE MONEY FROM THE

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:47.557
CITY'S I THINK THAT'S AN

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:48.592
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:49.226
IT WOULD PUT A LOT OF THE MONEY

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.028
IN ESCROW AND THEN THE CITY

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.696
WOULD GET IT BACK ONCE.

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.865
THE REQUIREMENT WAS SATISFIED --

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:55.966
ONCE IT MET SOME OBJECTIVE

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.200
STANDARD THAT THE STATE SET FOR

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.535
IT AND SO THAT MONEY WOULD BE

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.037
USED FOR THE PURPOSES.

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:01.672
UNDER THAT SITUATION THAT THE

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:02.906
VOTERS APPROVED ITS USE.

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:04.074
OF FORCE SO I YOU KNOW I THINK

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:04.841
THERE'S SOME I THINK THERE'S

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.176
SOME THERE'S SOME NEW ONES HERE

00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:07.177
APPRECIATE ALL THE

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.412
THOUGHTFULNESS FROM ALL THAT.

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.013
THE MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY WHO ARE

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.916
WORKING ON THIS AND AND PROPOSAL

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.151
IN GENERAL BUT YOU KNOW IT

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.085
KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THERE'S A

00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:15.686
PROCESS STILL HAPPEN THANKS.

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:19.890
THANK YOU.

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:20.891
CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.326
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:23.327
COUNTIES --

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:24.628
APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:25.996
THE COMMITTEE ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.831
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES HERE WITH

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.266
THIS CONCEPT OF USING.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:30.634
THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:33.136
ALLOCATION AS SORT OF A DE FACTO

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:34.538
PRODUCTION QUOTA --

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:35.972
WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.474
COMMITMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:39.176
THAT THEY DO NOT INTEND TO HOLD

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.944
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.012
FOR FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:42.913
THEIR CONTROL.

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.448
AND I THINK BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.416
USING OUR EXISTING RENO GOALS OR

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:48.452
SOME FUTURE LONG TERM HOUSING

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:49.519
PRODUCTION GOAL.

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:51.688
AS A STANDARD AGAINST WHICH

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.790
FUNDING IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:54.991
WE HAVE TO BE VERY.

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.960
COGNIZANT OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:58.562
OF MARKETS THAT EXIST IN THE

00:49:58.628 --> 00:49:59.896
STATE THE FACT IS THE LA --

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:02.032
NOTED THAT THE EXISTING GOALS

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.600
ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALLOCATED

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.868
BASED ON MARKET DEMAND BUT BY

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.737
DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS BASICALLY

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.305
WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW WE

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:09.973
WILL HAVE MORE --

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.608
ALLOCATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND WE

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.210
HAVE TO BE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.444
THE FACT THAT THE LA --

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.246
AND OTHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:18.148
WE PLAN FOR MUCH MORE BELOW

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.783
MARKET RATE HOUSING IN OUR LAND

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.918
USE PLANS THEN THE STATE FEDERAL

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:23.720
OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.389
REALISTICALLY FIND AND SO UNLESS

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.857
WE'RE GOING TO DRASTICALLY

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:27.691
REDUCE.

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:29.259
OUR PLANNING GOALS FOR

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.194
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'RE REALLY

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:32.362
JUST SETTING UP JURISDICTIONS TO

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.430
FAIL IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.465
AS THE YARDSTICK AGAINST WHICH

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:36.967
THEIR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IS

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:37.968
MEASURE --

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:38.635
SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.137
COMMITMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:42.205
FOR A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:44.007
REALLY ASK RECOGNITION THAT

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.409
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS IN

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:46.443
HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT ARE NOT

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.644
UNDER THE CONTROL BOARD OF

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:48.578
SUPERVISORS.

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:51.148
AND CITY COUNCILS AND WE'LL LOOK

00:50:51.214 --> 00:51:00.357
FORWARD TO HAVING.

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:03.794
CHAPTER TO GEAR AGAIN ADVOCATE --

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.697
THESE [inaudible] TEN YEARS.

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:10.100
YOU'RE NEEDING TO FOCUS A LOT

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:12.569
LONGER PERIOD AND THE CONCEPT OF

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:15.405
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEING BUILT

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:16.173
FOR FORTY YEARS.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:19.109
LIKE WISE SEEMS TO ME THAT TO IN

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.877
THESE CONSIDERATIONS I THINK THE

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:24.748
LONG TERM IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:24.948
NEED.

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:27.284
TO BASICALLY. TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.486
AS A MARKETING TOOL AND AGAIN

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.054
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT RIGHT NOW --

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.823
THAT FOR THE NEXT DECADE YOU ARE

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.291
GOING TO MEET THE INCREDIBLE

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:36.460
SHORTAGE NEEDS THAT HAVE TAKEN

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:39.162
MORE THAN TWO DECADES. TO CREATE

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:42.065
THE SITUATION [inaudible]

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:48.705
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.208
BUT THEN.

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.175
I'M BILL HIGGINS WITH CAL CALLED

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.810
AGAIN AND I'M MINDFUL OF THE

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:56.379
FOUR O'CLOCK OR FOUR HOURS I'LL

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:57.581
KEEP IT SHORT.

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:58.982
OF YOU YOU'RE WELCOME --

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.484
I JUST WANTED TO SAY ABOUT THE

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.918
SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:03.386
RINA GOAL --

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:04.721
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.590
THROUGH AND ABOUT TO GET THE

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:09.159
FIRST ROUND OF RINA NUMBERS FOR

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.460
THE NEXT ROUND OF PLANNING

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.595
CYCLES.

00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:16.967
AND BASED ON THE WARMER ECONOMY.

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:19.469
AND THE CHANGES THAT WE ALL

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:21.505
AGREE TO AN SB EIGHT TWENTY

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.539
EIGHT THE WINNER BILL LAST YEAR

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:25.475
AND SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE I WAS

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.877
SPEAKING TO A BAY AREA GROUP

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:27.844
LAST NIGHT WHERE I TOLD THEM

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:30.113
THAT THEIR RINA NUMBER THAT THEY

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.581
SHOULD EXPECTED TO DOUBLE.

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.350
AS A REGION BASED ON ALL OF

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:34.985
THOSE FACTORS WE THINK IT'S

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.219
GONNA BE A LOT.

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:36.853
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SHORT AND

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.223
LONG TERM IF YOU TAKE THOSE

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.124
HIGHER ARENAS ARE.

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.192
NUMBERS THAT WERE LIKELY TO GET

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.027
THEIR STILL PROBABLY SHORT OF

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.462
THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:47.130
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED.

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.765
SO THERE SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.634
OUT WHAT THAT GOAL IS AND IF

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.635
THAT'S WHAT THE GOAL IS THAT WE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:52.969
HAVE TO CHANGE IT AND THERE'S

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:54.170
GONNA HAVE TO BE SOME RESOURCES

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.672
ALIGNED WITH THAT.

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.208
BUT SHORT AND LONG TERM RIGHT IN

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.911
THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHT YOUR TO

00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:02.312
TENURE ARENA CYCLE THAT WAS WAS

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.947
HIS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:05.582
IS I KNOW THAT MY MEMBERS WHO

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.250
WANT TO HELP OR STRUGGLING WITH

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:08.885
WHAT THAT IS --

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.954
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:12.255
WAYS THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.090
SOME SHORT TERM IDENTIFICATION

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:16.192
OF SITES AND GET UNITS ON TOP.

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:19.396
WILL HAPPY TO SHARE THAT AS WE

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:19.696
GO FORWARD.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:22.132
THANK YOU.

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:24.601
AND THAT'S WHERE ONE ITEM NUMBER --

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:30.073
THREE RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.874
IT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.776
INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.311
GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.313
JURISDICTIONS ONE TIME FUNDS TO

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:37.914
SUPPORT REGIONAL PLANNING. TO

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.317
EXPAND OR DEVELOP SHELTERS FOR

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:40.984
THE HOMELESS AND TO MEET

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.319
MILESTONES TOWARDS ADDRESSING

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.486
HOMELESSNESS IN EACH

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.555
JURISDICTION WE ANTICIPATE THE

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.424
FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.758
THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.827
CARE AND THIRTEEN MOST POPULOUS

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.062
CITIES IN THE STATE.

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.598
BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:55.231
SEVENTEEN HOMELESSNESS POINT IN

00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:55.932
TIME COUNT.

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.434
JURISDICTIONS WILL BE ENCOURAGED

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.202
TO COOPERATE REGIONALLY TO

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.171
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:01.805
WHILE WE ARE STILL FINALIZING

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.273
THIS TRAVEL AS WELL I'M HAPPY TO

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.810
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN.

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:07.344
WELL.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:07.978
THAT'S MORALIS WITH THE

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:09.379
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:10.981
GOVERNOR'S INTEREST INVESTING IN

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.749
SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:14.184
HOMELESSNESS SEEMS REASONABLE

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.719
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.287
INVESTMENTS FOR PERMANENT

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.221
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN.

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.356
THE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS COULD

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:21.424
PROVIDE US IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:23.026
THESE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS RAMP

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.160
UP.

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.395
ON THE OTHER HAND TO THE

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:30.900
FLEXIBLE FUN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.302
FOR FOR HOMELESSNESS --

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.738
ADVANCEMENTS IS A BIT RISKY

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:35.505
SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.674
SAID ON ITEM ONE IT'S JUST

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:38.708
UNCLEAR HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.410
WILL RESPOND AND WHETHER THE

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.645
LEGISLATURE WILL SEE ITS

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:42.679
INTENDED OUTCOMES.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.014
INTO THEIR ALTERNATE USES THAT

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.181
POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE MOR

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.217
CERTAIN BENEFITS FOR THE

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:48.551
HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN THE STATE --

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.020
AND THEN FINALLY WILL JUST NOTE

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:51.187
THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.956
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES ALONG THE

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.224
LINES OF WHAT WE SAID ON THE

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.592
OTHER ITEMS AS WELL ABOUT HOW

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.627
THE FUNDING WILL GO OUT WHAT ARE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:59.496
THE MILESTONE SIX CETERA.

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.031
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:01.931
QUESTION FINANCE LAST YEAR WITH

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.967
THE HE PROGRAM FIVE HUNDRED

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.336
MILLION THIS IS.

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:08.471
LITTLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL AND WITH.

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:09.839
MUCH NEED OBVIOUSLY HOME THIS IS

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:11.107
THE BIG ISSUE IS CONCERNED

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.909
AMONGST A LOT OF MEMBERS SO HOW

00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:14.611
WILL THIS BE DIFFERENT AND WE WE

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:15.945
CAN MAKE SURE THE MONEY'S DOING

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.013
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.615
SHARE SAYS CAN THIS PROGRAM AND

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:19.783
IT'S IT'S A NEW PROGRAM BE

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.017
ADMINISTERED DIFFERENTLY FROM

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.452
THE HEAT PROGRAM.

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:23.987
WHICH IS THE HOUSING --

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.288
COORDINATING FINANCING COUNCILS

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.322
ONLY --

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:28.124
FUNDED PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IN

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.926
ADDITION MONITORING FOR THE HEAT

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:32.228
PROGRAM IS ONGOING I'M AND SO WE

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:33.697
DIDN'T WANT TO MIX THOSE FUNDS

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.799
AND WE DO SEE THESE AS A

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.801
DIFFERENT USE WEBER STILL I'M

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:38.868
WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THOSE

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.904
YEARS WE DO SEE THIS AS A

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.607
DIFFERENT PROGRAM WITH.

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:47.577
DIFFERENT TACK MILESTONES.

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.646
BUT YOU.

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:51.481
TO I WANT TO FOLLOW ON OUR

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.783
MISTER COOPER'S COMMENT SO SO

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:54.884
HEAP LAST YEAR WE HAD OUR HALF

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:55.952
BILLION WE GOT ANOTHER HALF

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:57.053
BILLION THIS YEAR ON AN ENTIRELY

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.788
NEW PROGRAM.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.390
HOUSING CAN BE DIFFERENT.

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:05.128
SET AND MIGHT CALL UP THE OTHER

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:05.662
COLLEAGUE FROM THE HOUSING

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:08.098
COORDINATING FINE FOR GENERAL

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.933
PURPOSE WHERE AS THESE PROGRAM

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:11.835
FUNDS WILL BE TARGETED MORE --

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.403
BALLER CONSIDERING THE USE SAYS

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.604
WE KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE TARGETED

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.840
TOWARDS SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.541
CENTERS.

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.110
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.945
ANYMORE AB ON THE HEAT PROGRAM.

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.747
OF THIS IS GINNY PARTY FOOT I'M

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.281
WITH THE HOMELESS CREATING

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:26.716
FINANCING COUNCIL.

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.884
OF THE HEAP FUNDS OF ALMOST ALL

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.786
BEEN DISPERSED I THINK WE HAVE

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:31.621
THREE MORE CEO SEES THAT ARE IN

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.189
THE PROCESS OF GETTING THEIR

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.691
FUNDS DISBURSED --

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:36.926
GENERALLY I CAN SAY THAT ABOUT

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:40.697
38% OF THE WAYS THAT STOCK

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.432
CONTINUES OF CARE HAVE PROPOSED

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:43.600
TO USE THOSE FUNDS ARE FOR

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:46.636
SERVICES. FOR HOMELESSNESS AND

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:49.305
ABOUT 34% ARE EARMARKED FOR

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:50.840
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CAN

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.642
BE CAN INCLUDE SHELTERS AND

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.277
NAVIGATION CENTERS BUT CAN ALSO

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:55.345
INCLUDE OTHER KINDS OF

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.780
HOMELESSNESS --

00:56:56.846 --> 00:56:59.582
IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN BELOW THAT

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:02.919
THERE IS A ABOUT. 14% FOR RENTAL

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:05.054
ASSISTANCE EITHER DIRECT RENTAL

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:07.824
SUBSIDIES OR SOME OTHER KIND OF

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:08.558
STUFF.

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:11.761
RENTAL SUPPORT AND THEN ABOUT 7%

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:14.063
SET ASIDE FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.866
WHICH IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.268
5% THAT WAS REQUIRED IN HEAP.

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.303
AND THEN ANOTHER 4% FOR

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.138
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH IS

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:27.944
LOWER THAN THE 5% ALLOWED.

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.412
AND THEN FINALLY OTHER.

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:29.979
IF I COULD JUST MAKE A FEW

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:30.814
COMMENTS SO AGAIN WHAT WE'RE

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.581
LEARNING TODAY AS WE HAD A

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.116
PROGRAM LAST YEAR BIG CHUNK OF

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.951
MONEY HASN'T BEEN ANALYZED AND

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:35.618
WE'RE SETTING UP AN ENTIRELY NEW

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:36.352
PROGRAM.

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:37.487
YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:38.755
THAT EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND AS

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.323
WELL SPENT I WOULD AGREE

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.891
DIRECTIONALLY I WOULD ABSOLUTE

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.593
SUPPORT THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.527
BEING SPENT.

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.562
I THINK THE QUESTION IS AROUND

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.096
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAKING SURE

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.698
THAT WE HAVE REAL EVIDENCE BASED

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.300
DATABASE APPROACHES TO ENDING

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.235
HOMELESSNESS AND I WOULD SUGGEST

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.870
IN AND OF OF OF COURSE WE ALL

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.038
WANT TO SUPPORT SHELTERS IN

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:57.674
EDUCATION CENTERS --

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.009
BUT IF WHAT I'M HEARING IT MIGHT

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:01.544
DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE SPENT FOR

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.679
THOSE TWO PURPOSES AND NOT

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.614
NECESSARILY FOR LONG TERM

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.115
PERMANENT.

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:07.417
SUPPORT OF HOUSING OPTIONS WERE

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:08.818
WAYS TO ENSURE THAT.

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:09.953
WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE INTO

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.020
PERMANENT SOLUTIONS.

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:12.488
THOSE ARE THE TWO SOURCES ARE

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:13.756
THE TWO I'M INVESTMENTS THAT

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.425
WE'VE IDENTIFIED HOWEVER WE ARE

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:17.126
CONSIDERING OTHER --

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.429
INVESTMENTS AT THIS TIME --

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.030
AND SO THOSE WILL BE FORTHCOMING

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.866
SO A GUEST IN SHORT NOTE RIGHT

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.334
NOW THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO WE'VE

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.935
IDENTIFIED BUT NOT THAT ONLY TWO

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.237
WERE CONSIDERED.

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:27.770
I THINK WHAT I WITH WOULD

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:28.638
SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.839
CALIFORNIA RECENT YEARS WE HAVE

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.708
SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.009
TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS AND

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.277
JURISDICTIONS ALL OVER THE STATE

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:34.944
OR SPENDING MONIES IN DIFFERENT

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.412
WAYS AND WE'RE NOT HAVING THE

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:37.213
IMPACT THAT WE WANT.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.681
I WILL USE MY OWN CITY AS AN

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:39.682
EXAMPLE OF THAT WE'VE SPENT

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.317
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.685
EVERY YEAR AND YET ARE HOMELESS

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.888
NUMBERS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.256
SO FOR ME.

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.157
ENSURING THAT WHATEVER WE DO IS

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.894
EVIDENCE BASED AND WITH THE GOAL

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.062
OF RESULTING IN GETTING PEOPLE

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.864
OUT OF SHELTERS INTO SUPPORT OF

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:56.532
HOUSING INTO SUPPORT OF HOUSING

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.768
SOLUTIONS THAT TO ME SHOULD BE.

00:58:58.835 --> 00:59:00.904
HOW WE WE THINK ABOUT THIS BUT

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.138
OBVIOUSLY WE LOOK FOR DEBT TO

HAD A 40% INCREASE IN ALMOST AS

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.252
THE LAST TWO YEARS.

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:16.853
I'M SURE MANY OF US HAVE GONE

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.021

FREEWAY UNDERNEATH FREEWAY

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:23.159
OVERPASSES AND IT'S

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:24.827
HEARTBREAKING --

THINK WE ALL AGREE TO THAT BUT

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:32.568
WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT THE

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:34.037
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO MAKE

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:34.671

CONSTRUCTING EMERGENCY SHELTERS.

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.214
AND THEN THAT THE APART PIECE

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:47.116
ABOUT LONG TERM PERMANENT

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:48.251
SUPPORT OF HOUSING.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.719
WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:51.955
THOSE DETAILS.

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.489

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.669
ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.538
COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.373
I THINK HE'S SPOT ON HERE AND

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.808
AND AND ALSO WHAT --

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.476
WOOD MISTER COOPER SAID YOU KNOW

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.911

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.312
AMOUNT OF MONEY BOTH LAST YEAR

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:16.913
WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.814
YEAR AND HAVING.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.549
METRICS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.250
EVIDENCE BASED --

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:23.920
THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE PER HE'S

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.388
BEING SPENT EFFECTIVELY AND

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.656
EFFICIENTLY IN IN THE RIGHT

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:27.757
MANNER BECAUSE AS ASSEMBLY

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:28.725
MEMBER WICKS SAID YOU KNOW WE

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.659
HEAR ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME IN

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.294
THERE SO MUCH ENERGY AROUND THIS

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.729
AROUND THE STATE --

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.697
IT IT REALLY IS A INCREDIBLE

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.032
MORAL CHALLENGE FOR US IN AND IN

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:37.333
ADDITION TO ECONOMIC CHALLENGE

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.968
AND SO TO SEE THAT WE SPEND HALF

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.003
A BILLION DOLLARS ON ONE THING

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.703
AND THEN TO IMMEDIATELY

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.038
TRANSITION TO SOMETHING ELSE

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.573
WITHOUT METRICS WITHOUT BEING

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:44.040
SURE ABOUT.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.708
DEFECTIVE SET OUT OF THAT HOW

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.343
THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON IS

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.112
IS IS A LITTLE GIVES US A LITTLE

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:50.646
BIT A PAUSE AND SO --

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:51.748
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE LOOK FORWARD

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.582
TO SEEING WHAT THE GOVERNOR WHAT

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:53.416
OTHER --

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.550
INVESTMENTS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.352
BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:56.953
THAT THE FOLKS ARE GONNA PAY A

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.187
LOT OF ATTENTION TO AND SO I

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.390
REALLY WANT TO ECHO WHAT

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:01.024
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SAID ABOUT

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:06.195
THE THIS QUIRK SILVA --

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.930
THANK YOU FOR THE WORK I A. B.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.932
RELATED TO HE FUNDS I KNOW THAT

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.134
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON I'M QUITE

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.302
A BIT AND I CAN SAY FOR MY

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.338
CITIES -- WE

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.006
HAVE HAD SOME OF OUR CITY'S TAKE

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:19.609
ADVANTAGE OF THE HEAP FUNDS AS A

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.377
MATTER OF FACT IN NORTH ORANGE

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.413
COUNTY WHICH IS A PRETTY TOUGH

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.915
AREA. TO GET --

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.984
TO I THINK OUR LOCAL ELECTED

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.920
INVESTED IN PURSUING STATE

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:33.556
FUNDING THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN --

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.824
A TOUGH -- I

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.426
THINK ARGUMENT FOR THEM TO

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.061
ACTUALLY GO TO THE STATE AND SAY

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:40.329
WE REALLY DO HAVE AN EMERGENCY

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.131
AND THEY DID ACTUALLY DO THAT

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.267
AND I BELIEVE RE RECEIVED ABOUT

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.968
TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.437
THAT IS NOW.

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:49.338
BEING USED IN THE END WHAT THEY

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:51.941
CALL THE NORTH COUNTY SPOT AREA

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.110
SO SPA NOT LIKE SPOCK WHAT WE

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.112
MIGHT THINK BUT SPA LIKE SERVICE

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.480
PROVIDER AREA.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.515
AND I THINK WHICH IS REALLY

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.484
INTERESTING AND IS TO SEE FROM

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.552
WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE AT THE

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.287
STATE DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.422
AND THAT HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.824
THE CONSTITUENTS SO.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.426
AGREEMENT WAS MADE THAT FULLER

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:11.194
TEN WOULD GIVE MONEY TO

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.663
PLACENTIA FOR AN EMERGENCY

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:16.065
SHELTER AND A BOY IN A PARK FOR

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.101
AN EMERGENCY SHELTER --

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.670
BUT RIGHT AWAY AS YOU MIGHT

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:22.905
SUSPECT THE WATER PARK PEOPLE

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:23.873
WERE LIKE HEY WHY IS FULLER TO

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.842
GETTING OFF THE HOOK AND THE

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.143
TRUTH IS FULLER CHEN AS HAD AN

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.178
ARMORY FOR THIRTY YEARS.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.613
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THIS IS

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.415
YOUR TURN AND THEN PLACENTIA

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.016
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT QUIET.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:38.387
BUT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HAVING

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.556
TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE SEE A LOT

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.891
OF OUR COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:42.558
THE PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:46.395
OF EVERYBODY LIKES THE IDEA

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.364
EVERYBODY WANTS THE FUNDS BUT WE

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.565
JUST DON'T WANT RIGHT THERE

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.300
THERE'S A BETTER LOCATION SO

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.235
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT RIGHT

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:54.604
NOW WE KNOW THAT STORY.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.272
BUT I THINK WHAT IS ENCOURAGING

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:57.773
IS.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.175
IT HASN'T JUST BEEN FROM THE

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.043
LOCAL TO THE STATE IT'S ALSO A

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.012
FEDERAL JUDGE IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.947
JUDGE DAVID CARTER IN ANY OF MY

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:06.115
COLLEAGUES --

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.284
IT SHOULD GET TO KNOW WHO HE IS

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.286
AND WHAT HE IS DOING BECAUSE HE

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.688
IS THE GAME CHANGER IN ORANGE

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.923
COUNTY.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.425
TO SOMETIMES USING A CARROT BUT

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.994
EVEN MORE I HAMMER RIGHT NOW

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.696
BECAUSE THE SITUATION THAT HAS

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:23.900
OCCURRED IN ORANGE COUNTY IS.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:27.003
JUST UNCONSCIONABLE IN ADDITION

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.437
TO SO HE FINALLY SAID ALMOST A

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.106
YEAR AGO WE ARE CLEARING THIS

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:31.641
RIVER BANK.

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.409
AND THAT WAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.310
PEOPLE BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.512
PLACE JUST TO CLEAR THEM.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.581
TOO SO WE KNOW THAT THEY ENDED

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.249
UP IN DIFFERENT CITIES AND MAYBE

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.751
ORIGINALLY WHERE EVER THEY WERE

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.753
FROM BUT NOW HE'S WORKED IN THE

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:46.155
SPOT AREAS NORTH.

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:48.357
CENTRAL AND SOUTH IN IS REALLY

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.593
HAS COMMITMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.094
SOUTHPAW WHICH IS OUR BEACH

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.497
CITIES IS SAY NO WE'RE NOT GOING

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:55.965
TO DO IT.

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.567
ANNE'S SAID FINE IF YOU DON'T

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.534
WANT TO DO IT THEN HE'S NOT

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.002
GOING TO FORCE OVERNIGHT CAMPING

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:01.771
SO FOR ALL OF YOU I HOPE YOU

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.573
LOOK AT BECAUSE NOW HE'S ALSO

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.241
WORKING WITH THE HEALTH AGENCIES.

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:07.410
TO SAY WHY DID TO OVER TWO

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.078
HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE DIE IN

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.580
ORANGE COUNTY AND HE HAS BROUGHT

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.114
IN SOME OF THE HEALTH PARTNERS

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.216
TO SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.150
WHAT YOUR ROLE.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.851
SO I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE I'VE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.653
BEEN WORKING ON THIS.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.955
FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO UP

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.823
TEAR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS AND

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.858
EVEN MORE THAN THAT AS A AS A

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.493
TEACHER SEEN FAMILIES BEING

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.795
DISPLACED.

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:27.730
AND ONE PERSON WITH OTHERS

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.265
WILLING CAN MAKE THESE

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:33.202
DIFFERENCES BUT IT HAS TO BE.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.303
LIKE MOST OF OUR LOOK LOCALS

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.172
DON'T LIKE CALLING THE CITIES TO

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.373
STAY AND SAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.474
GET OUT OF THIS WHAT WHERE IS

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.343
YOUR SOLUTION. FOR EACH ONE AND

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:43.246
OF COURSE MONEY BACK TO BACK IT

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:47.016
UP BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF THE

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.185
IT'S HE FOR FUTURE FUNDING.

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.553
AND THEY'RE FORCED TO USE THAT

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.124
WE WILL SEE SOME RESOLUTION.

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:56.692
IN THE COMMENTS MISTER GLORIA.

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:57.593
THANK YOU SKIPPER --

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.495
SO I WANT TO CLARIFY I THINK I

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.097
KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT HEAP IS ONE

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.465
TIME ONLY GOING AWAY SAID THIS

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:03.933
ISN'T IT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.269
IS IN THE SAME SPACE BUT

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:08.371
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.538
IT'S NOT AUGMENTING ITS

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:12.708
REPLACING. TO DO.

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:14.343
BUT WITH DIFFERENT GUIDELINES

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.412
KEEP KEEP WAS ONE TIME FLEXIBLE

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:17.747
BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THAT'S

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.782
CORRECT AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.484
JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE FRONT THAT

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.119
FUNDING THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.820
MILLION HAS BEEN DISPERSED.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.223
AND SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.524
CHANNEL YEAH SOME I GUESS MY

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.593
POINT IS THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:35.765
STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF BUDGET.

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:36.332
FORTY FIVE MILLION LAST YEAR

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:38.434
FIVE MILLION THIS YEAR --

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.869

SO.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.276
YOU KNOW FROM A LEVEL FUNDING

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.978
STANDPOINT THAT HAS A BIG

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.012
CONCERN BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.047
THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THERE THAT

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.048

CAN TALK ABOUT DOMINANCE.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:57.687
I WANTED TO ASSOCIATE --

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:59.655
I WANTED --

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:00.823
TO TO YOU TALKED ABOUT --

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.757
THAT NAVIGATION CENTERS IN

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.159
SHELTERS ARE ALLOWED BUT THERE

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:03.459
ARE OTHER.

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:05.127
YOU YOU GET SPECIFIC NUMBERS FOR

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:07.196
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.964
DO THIS PROGRAM UNDER HEAT

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.499
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY WHAT ABOUT

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.901
DID THESE FUNDS THESE THAT THE

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.436
FY.

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:14.036
NINETY TWO TWENTY SO RIGHT NOW

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.171
WE'VE IDENTIFIED EMERGENCY

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.706
SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.341
BUT WE ARE STILL CONSIDERING

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.909
OTHER POTENTIALLY I WOULD ASK

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:21.811
YOU NOT TO CONSIDER BUT TO DO --

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:23.112
BEYOND THAT --

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.047
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A MERCY

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.983
SHELTER THEY ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.819
BECAUSE THERE GRADUATING LESS

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:30.920
THAN 20% OF THE PEOPLE OUT OF

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:32.822
THE SHELL THE THESE TENTS --

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:35.291
INTO HOUSING AND THE REASON THEY

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.759
DO THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT PUT

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:37.593
RIGHT SO THEY GET OFF THE

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.894
STREETS THAT DEMONA CLARITY TO

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:39.762
GET UP THE STREETS THEY GET THE

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.763
TENT -- AND

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.064
THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO --

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.332
WE ARE CURRENTLY USING PROBABLY

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.734
SOME HEAT FUNNY I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.068
A 100% SURE BUT WE'VE ACQUIRED A

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.104
NAVIGATION CENTER WITH ZERO

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.038
HOUSING IN IT.

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:49.605
AND WE CAN'T NAVIGATE THEM

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.773
ANYWHERE TO GO OUT AND THIS IS

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.241
THE KIND OF MADNESS IT'S GONNA

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:53.676
LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.811
AND IN CONTINUED SUPPORT ISSUE

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:56.779
ALLOCATIONS.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.481
BELOW NEW ALLOCATIONS AND IT

01:06:58.547 --> 01:06:59.915
UNDERMINES OUR OVERALL CONCEPT

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:01.484
WHICH IS THAT WE CAN IN THIS AND

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.785
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T BECAUSE

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.853
OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE THIS

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.354
PROBLEM QUITE TO NINETY TWO THAT

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.722
WE DO SO --

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.391
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE HAVE A CARE

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:09.925
IN STATE CONVERSATION WITH

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.427
CITIES WHICH HAD CARE INSTEAD OF

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:12.795
RELATIVE TO HOUSING PRODUCTION

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.929
WE SHOULD HAVE THAT WITH REGARD

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:14.497
TO METRICS --

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.532
ON HOMELESS --

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.501
TRANSITION OFF THE STREETS --

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.069
IN NEAR AS I CAN SEE NAVIGATIONS

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.237
THERE'S A FINE TRANSITIONAL

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.005
HOUSING AND SHELTERS ARE FINE

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.306
BUT THE MISSING PART WOULD GETS

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.808
GUMMED UP IS THAT THERE'S NO WAY

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:26.776
TO PUT THEM BACK WITH THEM OUT

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:27.977
FROM THERE.

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.345
AND IF THE STATE'S NOT HELP IN

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:30.012
THERE AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HELP

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:35.885
IN -- SO I

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.887
WOULD JUST MAKE THAT THAT FAIRLY

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:40.823
COMMITTEE WHICH IS THAT WE CAN

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.791
BUSINESS --

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.426
AND WE STATE ECOSYSTEM OF

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:44.293
HOUSING OPTIONS PRINT OUR EGGS

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.430
INTO INTO BASKETS RATHER THAN

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:47.997
ALLMAN DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:50.232
SENSE TO ME.

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:52.168

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.026
MY INITIAL CONCERN WITH THE

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.000
THE BE GOOD TO GET THE DETAILS

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:05.768
BUT THE INITIAL CONCERT WITH

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:06.535
PROPOSAL IS.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:07.536
WE DON'T WANT TO GET STOCK IN

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.637
THE STATE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:09.738
WHERE.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:12.541
WE TAKE A YEAR TO DESIGN AN RF

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.143
P. WE TAKE ANOTHER YEAR TO HAVE

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.178
GRANT GUIDELINES AND THEN THREE

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.913
YEARS LATER PEOPLE APPLY IN THE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.248
MAYBE FIVE YEARS LATER AFTER

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:21.750
THE DOOR.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.419
SO I THINK WE WANT TO BE IN A

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:26.121
SITUATION --

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:29.124

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.831
PROBLEM IS IS TRYING TO GET THE

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.166
RESOURCES ON THE GROUND THEY

THE RATE OF ON CHILDREN

HOMELESSNESS IN IN THE STATE IS

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:24.386
ACTUALLY A VERY UNIQUE

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:25.353
PHENOMENON --

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.423

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.236

HOMELESSNESS BUT I THINK IT'S

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.351

RAPID RE HOUSING IS LESS

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:43.084

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:46.114
NEW PROGRAM THE TARGETS MIXED

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.348
INCOME HOUSING WE'RE STILL WE'RE

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.516
STILL WORK ON THE DETAILS OF

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.552
THAT PROGRAM BUT I'M HAPPY TO

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.220
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:57.325
L. L.. ONE SECOND OF THIS MODEL

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:57.859
IS WITH THE LA --

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:58.693
BUT WE'LL JUST RAISES SOME

01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.294
QUESTIONS FOR US ABOUT WHAT

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.995
POPULATIONS TO PRIORITIZE WITH

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:02.864
THIS FUNDING WELL THERE'S

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:03.731
CERTAINLY SOME NEED AMONG THE

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.166
MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:06.501
BECAUSE THE NEED FOR ASSISTANCE

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.703
AMONG LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.472
OUTSTRIPS AVAILABLE RESOURCES

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.706
AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HAVE

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.675
ACCESS TO IF YOU'RE OPTIONS FOR

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:15.577
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE WOULD SUCH

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:16.811
AS THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.480
STATE RESOURCES TOWARDS THAT

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:19.013
POPULATION RATHER THAN --

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.150
BROADENING OUT THE INCOME LEVELS --

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:25.019
AND THEN IN ADDITION WITH

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:27.922
EXAMPLES OF THE REASONS WHY SHIN.

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:28.923
SO -- WHILE

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.258
ON THE ONE HAND THE FUNDED

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.292
POTENTIALLY COULD BE RELEASED

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.361
IMMEDIATELY WHICH WOULD REFLECT

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.863
THE THE CRISIS BEFORE THE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:36.331
LEGISLATURE.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.932
ON THE OTHER HAND A NUMBER OF

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.834
OTHER RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PLACED

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.736
TOWARDS BILL BUT TAX CREDIT

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.238
PROGRAMS IN THE RECENT YEARS.

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.006
AND SO ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.641
DELAY THE FUNDING --

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:47.842
RELEASE AND THE COULD SENSUALLY

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.044
SERVE AS A BACKSTOP TO USE LATER

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.212
FOR EXAMPLE --

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.547
IN A SITUATION WHERE THE ECONOMY

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:54.015
WERE WEAKER --

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.617
THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:57.185
LONG TERM FUNDING FOR THE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.453
MAINTENANCE COSTS OF THE

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.621
AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WOULD BE

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.222
BUILT UNDER THIS --

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.390
IF THERE'S NO DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.424
THE MAINTENANCE COSTS THE

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.459
LEGISLATURE COULD SEE IT'S A

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:05.860
GAINES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.529
GLOSSED OVER TIME --

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.330
AND THEN FINALLY AS NOTED YOU

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.232
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THE

01:26:11.299 --> 01:26:11.766
DETAILS THAT ARE YET TO BE

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:12.867
DEVELOPED AND SO.

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:13.501
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS YOU'VE

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:15.103
BEEN ASKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:18.873
STAND HERE AS WELL.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:19.440
THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE

FIVE TIMES IN A ROW HERE IN THE

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.593
LEGISLATURE THAT IS TO

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:51.005
LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THAT

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:51.573
EXPANSION.

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.608
I'VE TWO COMMENTS FROM A POLICY

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.343
STANDPOINT AND WE HAD

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:00.648
SUPPORT OF MANY OF OUR

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:01.950
COLLEAGUES --

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:02.817
IN DECEMBER BEFORE THE

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ANY BE

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:06.688
TEN THEIR WITH THEIR TWO THINGS

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:09.624
I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT --

01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:11.793
ONE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CAP ON

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:14.062
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS AT SEVENTY

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.330
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF YOU

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.464
WERE TO REMOVE THAT CAP IT

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:17.932
ACTUALLY WOULD EXPAND THE MARKET

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.467
FOR THE TAX CREDIT.

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:20.768
AND COULD RAISE THE VALUE OF

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.804
THAT CREDIT OVER A DOLLAR SO --

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.372
WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:25.673
MINISTRATION ON DOING THAT I

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.910
THINK IT'S A VERY EASY WAY.

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:29.611
TO MAKE THAT TAX CREDIT GO

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:33.181
FARTHER ON THE SECOND ONE AS HE

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.048
WANTED PIGGY BACK ON WHAT THE LA --

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:34.749
WAS ASKED WHAT THE

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.918
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IS

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:39.153
TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THREE

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.787
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

01:27:39.854 --> 01:27:40.989
EXISTING PROGRAM TO A MILLION

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:44.659
DOLLARS TO GET AT 6280% OF AM I

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:49.097
AND AS AS YOU KNOW THERE IS

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:52.433
CURRENTLY --

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.969
AS THE UNITS ARE SERVING HOUSE

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.772
IT INCOME AVERAGING WOULD ALLOW.

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.741
HOUSEHOLDS AND EARN UP 280% A MY

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:00.808
TO BE PART OF THIS AS LONG AS

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:03.645
THE AVERAGE IS NO MORE THAN 60%.

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:04.812
I HAVE TO ASK WHY YOU FEEL

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.714
NECESSITY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.449
NEW PROGRAM WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.284
INCOME AVERAGING EMBEDDED IN

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:11.719
THIS I THINK THAT SORRY TRYING

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.087
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT --

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.957
GETTING INTO SOME OF THE THE THE

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.558
HIGHER INCOME CHALLENGES THAT

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.394
WE'VE BEEN SEEN AROUND THE FOR

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:19.861
BY HOUSING PROGRAMS.

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.095
SURE SO WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.096
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.831
ROLE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:25.099
WITH RESPECT TO THE INCOME

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.067
AVERAGING CHING THEM SORRY.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:27.468
WHICH WILL HELP FACILITATE THE

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.837
FOCUS WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH 68%

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:31.539
I AM I AM I HOWEVER WE'RE

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:33.107
BUILDING AND WE WANT TO BUILD

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:34.375

BAND THIS PROGRAM. TO

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:39.247

OKAY I I HAVE TO MIDNIGHT I

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.482
THINK --

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.051
INCOME AVERAGING IS ONE OF THE

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:44.452
VERY FEW THINGS THAT THE TRUMP

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:45.887
ADMINISTRATION DID THAT MADE A

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.355
LITTLE BIT OF SENSE --

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.359
ENTIRE POT OF MONEY TWO HUNDRED

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:53.394

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.263
ALLOCATE.

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.131
OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.133
HOUSING AND THEN IF THE

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.268
LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD YOU

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.636
ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE SAME

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.571
SORT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.506
TIMELINE FOR EXAMPLE.

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:15.176
ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.043
RESEARCH YOU.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.111
THINK THE ONE COMMENT I WOULD

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.712
ADD IN AND UNFORTUNATELY STIR

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:19.547
GLORIA HAD TO LEAVE AND HE

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:21.015
CHAIRS ARE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:22.917
HOW WE ADDRESS THE SO CALLED

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:23.584
MISSING MIDDLE.

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.019
WE ALL KNOW THAT BUILDING

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.420
MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING IS

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.089
CRITICAL IT'S NOT BEING BUILT

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.457
TODAY AND WHAT WE'RE REFERRING

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.891
TO IS A HOUSING THAT --

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.660
IT NEEDS TO BE BILL TO ADDRESS A

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:34.528
HUGE POPULATION OF THAT MAKES A

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:36.097
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH MONEY TO

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:37.731
QUALIFY FOR FOR WILL HOUSING --

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.234
BUT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH INCOME

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:42.336
TO PURCHASE CURRENTLY PRODUCED

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:45.039
MARKET RATE --

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:45.606
I THINK I WOULD JUST I WOULD

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.741
JUST SORT OF OBSERVE BUILDING

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.009
THESE UNITS ARE EXPENSIVE

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:49.844
BECAUSE THERE AREN'T OTHER

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.712
SUBSIDIES ARE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:53.914
WE CAN USE ON THIS --

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:57.218
AND HI I I LIKE THE IDEA OF US

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.752
INVESTING MONEY IN THIS CURRENT

01:35:58.819 --> 01:35:59.954
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM I KNOW

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.021
IS FORTY THREE MILLION.

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.556
YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT GOES UP TO

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:04.091
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I THINK

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.326
WE JUST HAVE TO THINK AGAIN OF

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.727
WHAT'S THE BEST USED FOR THE

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.229
SUBSIDY --

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:09.597
AND I DO I DO THINK THERE ARE

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:10.831
OTHER IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.166
THAT COULD LEVERAGE PRIVATE

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:14.068
SECTOR RESOURCES --

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.536
IN A MORE SIGNIFICANT WAY

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.037
EXEMPTING PROPERTY TAXES FOR

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.272
MISSING THEIR PRODUCTION FOR

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:19.807
EXAMPLE SO AGAIN --

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:21.041
THIS IS -- I

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.243
THINK THERE SHOULD BE A PLACE

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:23.644
HOLDER OF MONEY FOR THIS BUT

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:25.112
EXACTLY HOW YOU DO IT WHAT THAT

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:27.615
LEVEL IS COMPARED TO OTHER NEEDS

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:28.182
AS ONE AND I THINK WE SHOULD

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:32.520
TALK ABOUT.

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.187
TERMS WILL.

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:36.357
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.092

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GOAL IS HERE

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.629
AND IF IF THE GOAL IS TO DO

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.197
SOMETHING SUBSTANTIVE ARE WE

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:45.166
REALLY MOVING THE DIAL.

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.800
BY -- JUST

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:49.069
TAKE A YOU KNOW ONE TIME LUMP

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.838
SUM OF A HALF BILLION DOLLARS --

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.840
WHICH AT THE COST OF PRODUCTION

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:54.241
OF MOST HOUSING TODAY ACROSS THE

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.075
STATE.

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.644
BEING SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:57.945
NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:59.713
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT --

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:02.216
PRODUCES A THOUSAND UNITS TIME

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:02.850
NOT SAYING THAT THOSE THOUSAND

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.418
UNITS ARE NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.120
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:10.925
LIVE AND BUT THE NEED.

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.092
THAT NUMBER OF UNITS --

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:14.295
I JUST THINK WE NEED TO THINK

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:16.463
MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ABOUT THIS --

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.531

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:32.112
OF THIS KIND OF SUBSIDY --

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:35.683
OR FIND WAYS TO LOWER THE PER

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:37.384
UNIT CONSTRUCTION COST.

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.686
