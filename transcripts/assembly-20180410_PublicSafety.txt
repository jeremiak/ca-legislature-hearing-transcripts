AND IS ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS ENJOYS AN AYE AYE WRECK SO ALLOW ME TO BE VERY BRIEF AND PRESENTATION JUST EIGHTY MISTER QUIRK HAS. MOVED A BILL. THAT I'M SECOND UNIT. ADD THAT THIS BILL IS WITH RESPECT TO A BALLISTIC IMAGES AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE TYPE OF JIM WILLIAMS IN ACCOUNTABILITY. AND. WITH ME TODAY'S JAMES GIVEN SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CLARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. OFFICE AT IS ALSO SPEAKING SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY I'M JAMES GIVEN SHAPIRO I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE SANTA CLARA OFFICE I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. I HAD OUR HOMICIDE TEAM OUR VICTIM SERVICES UNIT AND OUR CRIME STRATEGIES UNIT SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL HOMICIDES IN THE STATE. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR ARE VICTIMS OF AN AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A GUN THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. IT IS SURPRISING THAT GUN CURRENT GUN CRIMES ARE NOT SOLVED MORE OFTEN. ONLY SIXTY PERCENT OF HOMICIDES ARE SOLVE ONLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. ARE SOLVED BUT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SOLVE MORE OF THESE CRIMES AND KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE FOR BY GETTING THE GUNS IN THE SHOOTERS OF THESE GUNS OFF THE STREET. BY TAKING GUNS FROM CRIME SCENES AND TEST FIRING THEM WE CAN DETERMINE THE MARKINGS THESE GUNS LEAVE ON THE SHELL CASINGS FROM BULLETS. BY TAKING SHELL CASINGS FROM EVERY CRIME SCENE AND TESTING THEM AND ANALYZING THEM IT ENTERING THEM INTO THE NATIONAL DATABASE RICANS LINKED TO UNSOLVED CRIMES. AND USE THE INFORMATION KNOWN IN THOSE TWO INSTANCES TO BUILD A CASE THAT SOLVES BOTH OF THEM. WE KNOW THAT THIS KIND OF TESTING WORKS TO LINK CRIMES TOGETHER AND TO SOLVE THEM JUST THIS YEAR IN PHOENIX POLICE USE THE SHELL CASINGS FOUND AT THE SCENES. OF EIGHT UNSOLVED MURDERS WITH THE GUN OF A SHOOTER TO LINK ALL OF THEM TOGETHER AND TO DETERMINE THAT HE IS A SERIAL KILLER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND I'LL BE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I DID YOU WITNESS ISN'T. IN OPPOSITION. ARE ANY. UP THERE YOU GO. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS IS HOW MUCH TIME BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CRIME LAB DIRECTORS. THE ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. ON TO WORK ON THEM. ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER. EVERY. CRY FORENSIC LAB HAS ACCESS TO THIS PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY. ON SOME CRIME LAST MISSION WILL AREAS TO NOT HAVE ACCESS OR THEY CANNOT CONTRACT OUT. WITH THEM OTHER CRIME LABS DUE TO RESOURCE SAYS SO WE BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO. DO WHAT THAT THE SPONSOR HAS EXPRESSED ON WITHOUT PUTTING ON DO BURDEN ON OTHER AGENCIES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ISSUE IS RESOLVED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CORSO'S ALONG TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION. ARE WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS FIRST. MISSES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT PRIORITIZES THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EVIDENCE PROBABLY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER TYPES OF EVIDENCE OF A GUN IS. A COLLECTED AT THE SCENE OF A CRIME OR MAYBE EVEN JUST TURNED IN. THERE ARE BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL TO TEST FIRE THAT WEAPON. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL INTO WHO DOESN'T HOW DOES IT WHO PAYS FOR THAT SORT OF THING. UP BUT THEN IT GETS ENTERED INTO NIGHT AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID. AND NOT EVERY AGENCY IN CRIME OF HAS ACCESS TO A NIGHT AND TERMINAL IF THEY DO IT'S NOT INEXPENSIVE. TO PROCURE THAT ACCESS. THE I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT WITH THE WITH THE PROCESS HERE WHICH IS THE. THE MANDATE THAT WE. HOW POLICE UNDERTAKEN VESTED HAITIANS HOW? SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS TAKE EVIDENCE ANALYZE IT COLLECTED. THE PRIORITIES WITH WHICH THOSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONDUCTED. I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN GUN CRIMES WANT TO KNOW IF THE GUNS BEEN USED IN ANOTHER CRIME THAT'S USEFUL INFORMATION BUT AGAIN WITH THE DETAILS. AND HOW WE ARE LEGISLATIVE WE PRIORITIZE IN THAT WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE COURT YEAH I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL AND WE HAVE A QUORUM. BUT THE AYE AYE GIVE CRIME LABS HAVE RAISED DE IN ISSUE OB I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU. WHAT DIRECTION SHE MIGHT LOOKING AND IF? IF IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT WHAT DIRECTIONS YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AND. OUGHT TO SOLVE THE ISSUE OF. RURAL PLACES NOT HAVING. ACCESS TO THE DATABASE IT'S BETTER. SURE WELL ACCORDING TO OUR SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE'VE CHECKED IN WITH THE A TF DIRECTLY AT WITH RESPECT TO THE OWN CRIME LAB AND. WE'VE BEEN ADVISED THAT ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE. SEEMS TO LACKS AT LACK ACCESS TO THIS A DATABASE ON THE CURRENTLY USE EVIL FINDER AND THAT. SOME OTHER CITIES USE HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATABASE SO I AS PREVIOUSLY HAS BEEN STATED WE WILL BE WORKING. WITH A OPPOSITION TO TRY AND ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BUT BEFORE. SO BUT IT'S THEIR CONCERN AYE AYE ANDERSON YEAH. LARGE COUNTY COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR RURAL AREAS. AND THAT WAS WHAT THE CRIME LAB DIRECTOR BROWN. SURE AND AS JAMES STEVEN SHAPIRO I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION SIR CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWENTY TWO NOT BEEN. CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S EVERY. MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA MOST MEDIUM SIZE METROPOLITAN AREAS AND FOR RURAL AREAS WHAT THEY DO NOW WHEN THEY WANT TO HAVE TEST FIRE A GUN OR AND HAVE BALLISTICS TESTING IS THE USE ONE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. THAT'S CLOSEST TO THEM AND THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO SAYING. AND WE CAN SOLVE MORE CRIMES WE CAN MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER BY DOING THAT. ALL THE TIME SO IT'S NOT THAT THE RULE AREAS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HAVE ACCESS TO REACH REGIONAL CENTERS. GREAT THANK YOU. SO. LET'S JUST GRABBED A QUORUM. JONES SAWYER HERE LACKEY. PATIO GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. QUIRK AIR SANTIAGO. HELLO YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECT AFTER I'VE. BOB AND I AND I. I'M.

PROBABLY JUST AS IMPORTANT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION AYE I DON'T. AND I'M NOT GOING TO PUT WORD ANY OPPOSITION FROM MOUTH BUT I I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WE SHOULD HAVE. AS MUCH TECHNOLOGY AS MUCH RESOURCES WE CAN SO WE CAN CURTAIL TRUE CRIME. IT IS A VALID POINT THAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP AND. OF IF YOU COULD. IF YOU WORK ON THAT AND IF IT NEEDS MORE RESOURCES A MEMBER UP SUB FIVE. I'M WILLING TO BRING THAT FORWARD AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT MAY BE NEEDED AND RURAL AREAS IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO TECHNOLOGY OR TRY TO FIND A WAY TO THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY NINE REGARDING THE RELEASE OF JUVENILE RECORDS IN CRIMINAL CASES. WHERE THEY MAY BE MADE WHERE THEY MAY BE MATERIAL THE CASE AT HAND? I WANT TO THANK. COUNSEL BURNLEY FOR HER ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. DOES CONTEMPLATE AMENDMENTS THERE'S A MOCK UP HAS BEEN PREPARED. HAS FOR A ONE OFF FOR THOSE OF THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TODAY BUT AGAIN I THINK FOR THE WORK YOU'RE STAFF ON THIS MATTER. CURRENTLY TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO JUVENILE RECORDS EITHER PROSECUTORS OR DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN CRIMINAL CASES. NEED TO PETITION THE JUVENILE COURT. TO ROOT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE RECORDS THEY'RE SEEKING. OF THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE AND MAKES A DECISION ON THEIR RELEASE. AND THEN A CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE MAKES A DECISION REGARDING THEIR RELEVANCY. CASE WAS SORT OF A TWO STEP PROBLEM PROCESS. MORE OFTEN THEN NOT THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE WILL NOT RELEASE RECORDS UNTIL THE CASE IS READY TO GO TO TRIAL. THIS CONSUMERS BE UP TO A YEAR OR TWO AFTER AN ARREST IS MADE. UPON THEIR RELEASE PROVIDER COME A COURT JUDGE BELIEVES THEY ARE RELEVANT TO THE PRECEDING. THEIR MAY BE FURTHER DELAYS AS A RECORD THEMSELVES. ONCE RELEASED ONCE OF THE HANDS OF THE RELEVANT LAWYERS. REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND BACK GROUNDWORK. SO THAT LATE RELEASE ACTUALLY. IMPEDES A EARLY JUSTICE FOR FOLKS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PROLONG THE TRIAL COULD HAVE THE DEVIL AFFECT ON A VICTIM WHOSE RECORDS ARE LIKE IT WAS BEING ACCESS ASK. ACCESSED. AND THE ACCUSED THEM FACES A LONGER TRIAL. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY NINE AIMS TO SPRING STREAMLINED THE PROCESS FOR THE RELEASE OF THESE RECORDS. WHEN THEY MAY BE MATERIAL EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE. THE BILL PROVIDES THE CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ACCESS TO THE JUVENILE CASE FILE HAS BEEN REQUESTED. ALLOWING THE JUDGE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION REGARDING THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE TRIAL. AND EXPERT IDEA RELEASE. RECOGNIZING OF CONFIDENTIALITY IN THE HAMLET OF JUVENILE RECORDS. THE BILL REQUIRES PARTIES RECEIVING A CASE FILE TO SIGN A COURT ORDER. TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY. IN THIS WAY THE BILL BALANCES THE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR VICTIMS AND ACCUSED ALIKE WHILE MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY THE PERSONAL JUVENILE RECORDS BEING. ACCESSED. I I CERTAINLY WANT TO SAY WELL I AM GRATEFUL TO BE IN THIS HEARING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. AS A LAWYER MYSELF I KNOW THIS IS THIS BILL GETS INTO DALLAS OR THE WEEDS OF PROCESS. AND PEOPLE CONTINUE TO READ THE BILL A LOOK AT THE BILL AND TRIED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A FAIR OUTCOME AND A GOOD BALANCE SEEN. AND OUT OF COURSE WORK WITH ALL OF SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. TO THAT END. I HAVE SHAUN HOPPIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SEAN OFTEN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. I WITH UNFORTUNATE FREQUENCY THE LIVES OF YOUNG VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE OFTEN INTERSECT WITH CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. PRIOR TO A CRIMINAL CASE IN COURT DOCUMENTS GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THIS INVOLVEMENT QUITE OFTEN BECOME MATERIAL. TO THE PARTIES IN A CRIMINAL CASE BOTH FOR THE PROSECUTION AND FOR THE DEFENSE. ARE THEY MAY ASSIST THE PROSECUTION IN ESTABLISHING PRIOR OCCASIONS OF ABUSE OR MAY PROVIDE EXCULPATORY OR IMPEACHMENT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO THE DEFENSE OF THE ACCUSED. ULTIMATELY THOSE RECORDS BECOME PART OF THE JUVENILE CASE FILE WHICH CRIMINAL TRIAL JUDGE WILL ULTIMATELY NEED REVIEW AND WHICH PROSECUTORS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS MAY NEED ACCESS. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THE. CURRENT. DUAL REVIEW PROCESS THAT EXISTS IS. IS. SOMEWHAT INEFFICIENT. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE FOR DIRECT ACCESS OF A JUVENILE CASE FILE TO CRIMINAL TRIAL JUDGE. TO BALANCE THOSE INTERESTS IN A TIMELY MORE EFFICIENT FASHION. MAINTAINING STRICT PROTECTIONS THOSE RECORDS AND REQUIRING THE SAME BALANCE OF INTERESTS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN SECTION EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN OF THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE. SO ALLOW TRIAL JUDGE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION MUCH MORE QUICKLY ALLOWING BUT THE PROSECUTOR AND THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO REQUEST AN EXAMINATION. OF JUVENILE CASE FILE DIRECTLY TO THE TRIAL JUDGE. AND AGAIN MAINTAINING THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN WHILE FOR INSTITUTIONS CODY TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRING THE BALANCING OF INTERESTS OF THE MINOR WITH THE NEEDS OF THE PROSECUTION TO INFORM THE JURY AND THE NEEDS OF THE DEFENSE TO DEFEND THE ACCUSED ADEQUATELY. I'D ALSO BINDS BOTH THE PROSECUTION THE DEFENSE WITH A COURT ORDER LIMITING THE USE OF THOSE RECORDS EXCLUSIVELY TO. THE SPECIFIC CRIMINAL CASE AT HAND HOW THAT MIND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I DON'T. THANK YOU. I'M MARGOT TORTURED CLOSER TO THE MIKE PLEASE I'M SORRY. I'M MARGOT GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE ON THIS INFORMATION SOMETIMES CAN BE CRUCIAL. ALMOND EXAMPLE WAS THE CHILD MOLEST CASE WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE RESIDING IN ANOTHER COUNTY. THE DEPENDENCY RECORDS WHEN I FINALLY GOT THEM SHOWED THAT THE FATHER  <u><c.green>NOT MY CLIENT WAS</c></u> THE ACTUAL PERPETRATOR OF THE MOLEST. SO THESE RECORDS ON THEM ARAB ARE CRUCIAL TO OF BEING ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DEFEND OUR CLIENTS AND THE PROCESS NOW. IS EVEN WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY IS CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT. AND. YOU DO NOT GET THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER SO IT MEANS THAT THE TWELVE GETS CONTINUED. SO WE ALSO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IS NOT TOO OFTEN WE'RE ON THE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE YES I WOULD CAN GRADUALLY TO OFFER I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE PUB. THANK YOU AND WELCOME ARE ANY OTHER. ANYONE ELSE AND SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. AND ONE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THERE. SO. IN THIS CASE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A TRIAL THAT THE JUVENILE IS INVOLVED IN OR IS THIS SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIAL WHERE THE JUVENILE RECORD IS IMPORTANT. SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIAL WHERE THEIR INFORMATION JUNE RECORD MAY BE RELEVANT TO THE PROCEEDING. SO THAT'S WHY WE GET A RELEASE AND THEN THE JUDGE. THE CRIMINAL TRIAL LAST RETAINS IS A MATERIAL IN THIS DOCUMENT RELEVANT TO THE PROCEEDING. AND IT'S JUST. HOW DOES SOMEBODY KNOW TO EVEN ASK FOR IT? IT DEPENDS IF IN A CAN ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK JAPANESE JUST RICE FOR THE FACT PARA WHO THE PARTIES ARE. AND THE PERSONS INVOLVED. IN SOME WAY IN THAT COMPLEX SET OF FACTS HAVE A CONNECTION NICOLA THAT GORE SYSTEM. AND IS THIS REALLY THE BILL SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF OR THE RECOGNIZES YOU MESSAGES LA JUST YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEN THE. THE FINAL QUESTION IS. HOW THIS IS EXACTLY SPEED THINGS UP SO APPARENTLY IT CAN BE DONE NOW AND THIS PROCEDURE MAKES IT FASTER? WHAT EXACTLY IS? MAKING IT FASTER. SO. RIGHT NOW MOVES UP THE TIME TABLE OF WHEN IT GETS EXAMINED IT RECALLS A CORK IT REQUIRES TWO REVIEWS. DONE BY THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGE IN A. IN THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE WOULDN'T THIS WOULD CREATE SORT OF. A MECHANISM BY WHICH WE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONE LEVEL OF REVIEW STILL VESTED WITHIN THAT JUDGE PERFECT THANK YOU. THINK I MOVED TO BE OUT. THERE'S THERE'S A MOTION. ARE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER ARAFAT YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY TIME I KNOW YOU HAVE PLENTY WORK TODAY THANK YOU. OF CHAIRS RECOMMEND I. BUT SECRETARY CLITORAL. AB TWENTY SIX IF DENIED THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO THAT LEO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSES THEY GRADUALLY. SO. STILL NO STONE NOTE. NO CHAO. AND I HAVE MISTER HARPER NEXT IS HE HERE NO. AND NEXT MISS BAKER. BUT YOU'RE NEXT. AND THE EARLY BIRD BUT. THE MORNING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I MATT VERY UP HONORED TO PRESENT YOU TODAY AB TWENTY THREE OH TO. AB TWENTY THREE OH TWO WHICH INCLUDE THE FAILURE TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD. AS A CONTINUING OFFENSE FOR MANDATED REPORTERS. I THIS MEANS AT THE ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS DISCOVER ABUSE THAT THE MANDATED REPORTER DID NOT REPORT. UNDER CURRENT LAW A MANDATED REPORTER WHO FEELS TO REPORTING INSTEAD OF KNOWN OR REASONABLY SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT IS GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO SIX MONTHS CONFINEMENT IN COUNTY JAIL. OR BY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AB TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THE STATUE LIMITATION RIGHT NOW FOR FAILING TO REPORT IS ONE YEAR STARTING FROM WHEN THE MANDATED REPORTER FIRST REALIZE YOU'RE SUSPECTED THERE WAS A POTENTIAL. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. THIS IS IN CONTRAST. WITH. OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE LAW WHERE INTENTIONALLY CONCEALING SUSPECTED ASSAULT OF A CHILD IS A CONTINUING OFFENSE MEANING THAT THE STATE'S IMITATIONS DOES NOT KICK IN UNTIL A LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCOVERS THAT THE. INFORMATION WAS NOT REPORTED. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FAILURE TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD IS A CONTINUING OFFENSE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FIXES. THE PROBLEM THAT COMES FROM THIS WAS ACTUALLY DISCOVERED DURING THE LARRY NASSER CASE IN MICHIGAN. WHERE MANY MANY OF THE MANDATED REPORTERS THAT THE CHILDREN WHO WERE? ABUSE BY NASSER DID NOT REPORT AND THEY COULD NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS HAD LONG SINCE TOLD. AND I MEMBERS WE MET ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY FOUR OF THOSE VICTIMS. I THERE WERE WONDERFUL VERY COURAGEOUS ATHLETES OF WHO I VISITED WITH ABOUT THIS BILL AND THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUSPECTED THAT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING TO THEM AND THEY DID NOTHING. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE FIX THAT PROBLEM NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN THE KIDS? ME. I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE ONE YOUR STATS LIMITATION IT'S STILL ONE YEAR. IT IS PROSPECT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IT HAS TO BE SO ANY WHO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION ANY MANDATED REPORTERS. WOULD BE. WELL AWARE THEY HAVE ON NOTICE THAT THEY HAVE THIS OF THIS IS JUST FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD SO THIS IS VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED. I WHICH I THINK IT DESERVES BEING TREATED THE SAME AS INTENTIONALLY CONCEALING OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD. AND. IT IS TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW IS IN OUR CALIFORNIA LONG NOW WE ARE ON NOTICE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN WE DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I'M VERY PLEASED TODAY TO HAVE WITH ME IN SUPPORT ALSO BRIAN TIERNEY FROM THE CONTRA COSTA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AND LIEUTENANT BRIAN SOUTH FROM ROCK POLICE DEPARTMENT ADJUST TO JOIN FOR A MOMENT THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING FAILING MY NAME IS BRIAN SOUTH ON POLICE LIEUTENANT WITH THE MORAGA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOES ADDRESS A PROBLEM REGARDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MANDATED REPORTING OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD. AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT MISDEMEANOR FOR MANDATED REPORTERS WHO FAILED TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AND THAT ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS STARTS WHEN THE MANDATED REPORTER FAILS TO REPORT THAT ABUSE. THIS BILL WOULD INCLUDE FAILURE OF MANDATED REPORTERS TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD AS A CONTINUING OFFENSE. AS SHE INDICATED THIS MEANS OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD START WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OR CHILD WELFARE AGENCY LEARNS OF THIS FAILURE TO REPORT. THIS IS IMPORTANT FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE AT TIMES CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE CASES ARE NOT DISCOVERED IT IS CLOSED UNTIL. SOMETIME LATER AND I'VE WORKED WITH THOSE SURVIVORS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH A POLICE INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL PROSECUTION OF THEIR ABUSER. AND THAT THE REAL KEY IS THAT WE KNOW THAT EARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTION IN THESE CASES HELPS TO PREVENT FURTHER VICTIMIZATION NOT ONLY OF THAT SURVIVOR BUT OF ANY OTHER VICTIMS. IF WE GET INVOLVED WE CAN INITIATE INVESTIGATION AND HOLD THE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABLE. SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SEXUAL ABUSE. OKAY. YOU CAN CLOSE IF YOU LIKED HIS RANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE TO TURN IT SORRY MONEY BRIAN TIERNEY. DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. BEEN AN ATTORNEY FOR NINETEEN YEARS. I'VE BEEN A DEPUTY DA FOR FOURTEEN. I'M CURRENTLY IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT UNIT WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THIS IS MY SECOND TOUR. I GUESS I'M HERE TO TO GIVE OF REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS LAW THAT IN THE CURRENT. STATE HAS FAILED WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK TO LARRY NASSER WE CAN LOOK TO COUNTY OUR OWN CASES WITHIN OUR COUNTY. TO REALIZE THAT THE LAW IS COMING UP SHORT. WHEN WE HAVE MANDATORY REPORTERS IN THE LAW FORCES THEM BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN AND THE CLOSE CONTACT THAT THEY HAVE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. CAN SEE THINGS AND NOTIFY AUTHORITIES WHEN THEY KNOW SOMETHING IS GOING ON AND THEY FAILED TO DO THAT. AND THEN FIVE YEARS GOES BY AND THAT PERSON WHO FAILED TO REPORT THAT YOUNG CHILD CONTINUES TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN MOLESTED OVER AND OVER AND OVER. FOR YEARS TO COME. THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM THE CAR. AND CURRENT LAW. A WEEK HAVE CASES THAT THAT HAS EXACTLY OCCURRED AND WE CANNOT PROSECUTE THAT PERSON. NOW SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ARE UNIQUE IN A SITUATION. IT IN A UNIQUE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY CAN OCCUR OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. AND THE CURRENT LAW. DOES NOT PROTECT THOSE KIDS IF THE MOLESTATION STARTS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GOES TO JUNIOR HIGH. GOES INTO HIGH SCHOOL. WE MAY NOT FIND OUT FOR FIVE TEN YEARS LATER AND WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT PERSON WHO KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND FAILED TO PROTECT THAT CHILD BECAUSE THE MANDATORY REPORTER LAWS ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN ALL WE'RE ASKING YOU IS TO GIVE THE LAW LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH. AND AND ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE TO DO WHAT WE WANNA DO IS. FIND OUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING IN YOU KNOW SOMETHING EITHER YOU THE NO REASON YOU SUSPECT. TELL THE AUTHORITIES MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO ANYTHING BUT IF IT DOES IT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT CHILD. FROM BEING A VICTIM FOR YEARS ON END AND RIGHT NOW THE LAWS IT IS NOT. SUFFICIENT. CANI ASKED YOU GUYS. WITH CATHARINE BAKER HELP TO FIX OUT LAW. THANK YOU THANK YOU OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MICHELLE THOMAS SHOP REPRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEEDS HIM ALLEN STRONG SUPPORT. SHAWN HOP IN THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING ARE KATHY SURE HOW THE HOUSE OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR ADVOCACY AND POLICY. PUMP STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS EXIST FOR PRACTICAL MEANING FOR PRACTICAL REASONS AND AS A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS. FROM THE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT STATURE DOES STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE IN CHARGE CRIMES PROMPTLY. AND ENSURE THAT CASES ARE HEARD BEFORE EVIDENCE IS LOST MEMORIES HAVE FADED IN WITNESSES BECOME UNAVAILABLE. AS IS IMPORTANT TO BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE. IN CASES REGARDING AN OMISSION SUCH AS A FAILURE TO REPORT IT CAN BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO A DEFENDANT. TO BE ABLE TO CONTEST THE CHARGES Y. MEMORIES ARE STILL FRESH. I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT JOBS THAT YOU HELD FIVE YEARS AGO OR TEN YEARS AGO. THINKING ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT. TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION YOU HAD WHAT YOU DID ABOUT THAT INFORMATION CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AT THAT DISTANCE YOU MAY HAVE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER JOB. YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RECORDS FROM THAT FIRST JOB THAT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROSECUTING FOR THEIR FAILURES TO REPORT I THINK UP PUTS. MANDATED REPORTERS IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. THE DEFENDANT MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING WHAT HE OR SHE DID HIT DID OR DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AN INCIDENT OF ABUSE. OR WHAT THEY MAY HAVE DONE TO TRY TO REPORT THEIR THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE DO DO SOMETHING TO REPORT THE ABUSE AND. PROBE FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT REPORT GETS GETS LOST IN IN COMMUNICATION. THAT PUTS THE PERSON IN THE POSITION WHERE IT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEST THE PROSECUTION'S VERSION OF EVENTS. FROM A FAIRNESS STANDPOINT AT SOME POINT INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SECURE IN THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. UP MANY MANY YEARS AGO. MANDATE REPORTERS OF PEOPLE IN HELPING PROFESSIONS PEOPLE SUCH AS TEACHERS WHO HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING CHILDREN. I THINK SUBJECTING THEM TO POTENTIAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR A FAILURE TO REPORT AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT. INTENTIONAL CONCEALMENT THAT ALREADY IS A CONTINUING OFFENSE. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FAILURE TO REPORT. I IT IT MAKES THOSE JOBS HARDER AND IT PUTS THOSE PEOPLE IN A POSITION WHERE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPORT BECAUSE OF THIS CONTINUING DANGER THAT THAT THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. WE ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY HEARING NONE. MIKLOS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR. THAT TESTIMONY OBSERVE A SUITCASE IF I COULD ROBERT PLANT. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE PENALTIES FOR MANDATE REPORTERS OUT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT IT'S STILL A MISDEMEANOR. CORRECT THINKING. THANK YOU. AS I APPRECIATE THE GOOD QUESTION AND. ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF MY MOM IS A RETIRED TEACHER GET TO BRAG ABOUT OUR AWARD WINNING PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS MINDFUL OF HOW THEY SHOULD BE ON FAIR NOTICE THIS BILL IS PERSPECTIVE SO GOING BACK TWENTY YEARS WILL NOT HAPPEN IT'S THAT MEMBERS OF THOSE PROFESSIONS WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT GOING FORWARD. THEY HAVE THIS AND AND I JUST THINK MORE OF TEACHERS THAT THEY WON'T TRY NOT TO KNOW. ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT KIDS. TEACHERS WANT TO PROTECT KIDS THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO TURN A BLIND EYE THEY. I I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IS AN ATTITUDE THAT WOULD KEEP PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE PROFESSION OR EVEN DOING THE PROFESSION TO THE BEST THEIR ABILITY IN PROTECTING CHILDREN. AND FINALLY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT REMEMBER THIS IS A ONE YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS WERE NOT CHANGING THAT. THE SIGNIFICANCE IS IN MANY OF THOSE CASES WHERE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT STALE EVIDENCE THERE'S A THREE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. AND THIS ONE WILL KICK IN WHEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT FINDS OUT TO THEY STILL HAVE TO GET IT DONE WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS THIS BILL THIS WAY AND BALANCED IT THIS WAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THE FIRST AND SECOND MICHAEL WORLD. AB TWENTY THREE OH TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NOT VOTING LACKEY LACKEY AYE CARILLO. CAMEO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THE MEASURE PASSES CONGRADULATIONS. SO. WHAT IS THAT SO? SUCH. AS. PLUS SOME STUFF HARPER. TODAY'S PURPLE TIE DAISY. MR LOW HAD A PURPLE TIE ON EARLIER. I. BUT ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO. OF MISCHIEF I'M IT WILL SAY IT IS ENOUGH RECOGNITION OF OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE TO CONSIDER WHETHER A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HAS BEEN STRANGLED OR SUFFOCATED BEFORE ALLOWING THEIR AGGRESSOR TO POST BAIL. APPROXIMATELY FORTY PERCENT OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT SOME POINT WITHIN THEIR LIVES. THAT IS NEARLY EIGHT MILLION WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WHO WILL BE ASSAULTED BY SOMEONE THAT THEY MAY LOVE OR TRUST. ONE OF THE MOST FEET SERIOUS FORMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS STRANGULATION. THIS IS DUE THE FACT THAT MANY MORE PRESSURE ON THE NECK CAN RESTRICT BLOOD FLOW AND PREVENT OXYGEN FROM GETTING TO THE BRAIN. WITHIN TEN SECONDS OF BEING STRANGLED A PERSON CAN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. EVEN WORSE WITHIN FOUR MINUTES A PERSON CAN BECOME BRAINDEAD. UNFORTUNATELY STRANGULATION MAY LEAVE LITTLE EVIDENCE ON THE SKIN. STUDY BY THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF THREE HUNDRED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES INVOLVING STRANGULATION REVEALED THAT UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF VICTIMS HAD NO VISIBLE. INJURIES THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS WHO'VE BEEN STRANGLED ARE A GREATER RISK OF BEING MURDERED. ACCORDING TO THE TRAINING INSTITUTE ON STRANGLED STRANGULATION PREVENTION THE ODDS FOR HOMICIDE INCREASE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT FOR VICTIMS WHO'VE PREVIOUSLY BEEN STRANGLED. WHEN PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN POST BAIL WITHOUT SEEING THE JUDGE FIRST VICTIMS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SEEK HELP. BEFORE THEIR AGGRESSOR IS RELEASED. ON ONE DAY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND HELP REQUESTS STATE SERVICES BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS THAT WENT UNMET ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENSUS. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES MOST OF THESE REQUESTS WERE FOR ASSISTING FINDING. TEMPORARY HOUSING. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOR SIXTY TWO IS NEEDED PREVENT TO PROVIDE FOR VICTIMS OF STRANGULATION AND SUFFOCATION WITH THE TIME THAT THEY NEED TO GATHER THEIR BELONGINGS. SEEK PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT AND DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR ABUSER. WITH ME TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS KIRK MICHELLE'S OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND GERALD FEYNMAN ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR HOPE INTERNATIONAL. AND THE TRAINING INSTITUTE ON STRANGULATION PREVENT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MY. GUESTS PREDICTING HERE RIGHT. MY NAME IS KURT KNUCKLES AND I AM A PROSECUTOR WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND I DO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO. WHY MEANT THE PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE? WHEN IT ALREADY REQUIRES CRIMINAL COURT JUDGES TO CONSIDER AMONG OTHER THINGS THE SERIOUSNESS OF AN OFFENCE AND PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC WHEN SETTING BAIL. ALSO WHY MODIFY IT WHEN THAT STATUTE ALREADY SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES JUDGES TO. CONSIDER INJURIES TO THE VICTIM. THREATS TO VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. A DURING THE CRIME AND THE USE OF FIREARMS OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS DURING THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS THAT TRULY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. REQUIRES JUDGES TO FIRST TRULY APPRECIATE THE DANGER PRESENTED BY A DEFENDANT. ASSESSING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME SIMILARLY REQUIRES A JUDGE TO TRULY APPRECIATE HOW SERIOUS THE CRIME ACTUALLY IS. BROKEN BONES BLOODY WOUNDS. SWOLLEN A DISFIGURED BODY PARTS ARE OBVIOUSLY SERIOUS. USE OF GUNS AND OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME REQUIRE NO FURTHER EMPHASIS. THREATS TO KILL OR HARM VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. IN THE STRANGULATION CONTEXT HOWEVER. SERIOUS LIFE THREATENING STRANGULATION EVENTS. AS OFTEN AS NOT LEAVE NO VISIBLE INJURIES WHATSOEVER. I HAVE PERSONALLY PROSECUTED HOMICIDE CASES IN WHICH ARE TOPS WE AUTOPSIES WERE REQUIRED BEFORE THE CRIME COULD EVEN BE DETECTED OR THE INJURIES COULD BE DETECTED BECAUSE OF DEATH. THREATS USED IN STRANGULATION CASES CASES ARE OFTEN UNSPOKEN. BUT PERFECTLY CLEAR IN THE EYES OF THE PERPETRATOR AS HIS FACE TO FACE WITH HIS HANDS CLENCHED AROUND THE VICTIM'S NECK. SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OVER. HANDS ARE THE WEAPONS OF CHOICE FOR PEOPLE WHO STRANGLED OTHER PEOPLE NOT WHAT WE THINK OF AS TRADITIONAL. ARE DEADLY WEAPONS. THAT DV VICTIMS WHO SURVIVE JUST ONE. OKAY SURVIVE JUST ONE STRANGULATION EVENT ARE MANY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BECOME A HOMICIDE VICTIM. IS NOT COMMON KNOWLEDGE. UNTIL IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN THE OTHER STATISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED OR WILL BE SHARED WITH YOU TODAY ARE COMMON KNOWLEDGE BILLS LIKE THIS ARE REQUIRED AND THEY WILL SAVE LIVES. JUST ONE MEASURE WE HAVE TIME HERE FROM THE OTHER WITNESS BUT YOU TWO MINUTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE GERALD PINE AND. I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR HOPE INTERNATIONAL AND THE TRAINING INSTITUTE ON STRANGULATION PREVENTION WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTYELEVEN. FROM FUNDING FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M ALSO A PROSECUTOR WITH RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I'M GONNA PROSECUTOR FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT STRANGULATION IS DIFFERENT. IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF INJURY AND IT SAYS A DIFFERENT THING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO INFLICT STRANGULATION. WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE STUDIES OF THIS STUDY ALTHOUGH WAS THAT STARTED THE CDA OR CDA ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IT WAS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE. SO TO PEER REVIEWED STUDY WE TALK ABOUT STUDIES WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE ALTHOUGH FIFTY PERCENT OF VICTIMS HAD NO VISIBLE EXTERNAL INJURY THAT IN ME THEY DIDN'T HAVE INTERNAL INJURY. AND IT DIDN'T. MEAN THAT THERE WERE OTHER INJURIES THAT COULDN'T BE PHOTOGRAPHED. THESE PERPETRATORS ARE NOT ONLY A DANGER TO THE VICTIM THEY ARE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE OF THE FORTY SIX OFFICERS WHO WERE MURDERED BY HANDGUN VIOLENCE DIED AT THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH THE STRANGULATION HISTORY. THOSE PEOPLE REPRESENT NOT ONLY A THREAT TO OFFICERS BUT TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR MASS KILLERS. YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE OMAR MARTINE IN ORLANDO AYE ESTEBAN SANTIAGO IMPORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD STRANGULATION HISTORIES ARE SCHOOL SHOOTERS CEDRIC A. SAID RICK ANDERSON IN SAN BERNARDINO. HAD A STRANGULATION HISTORY THIS ALLOWS THE COURT TO PUT AT ITS FOREFRONT THE ISSUE THAT TELLS US MORE DIRECTLY THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE. ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF AN OFFENDER AND FOR THAT REASON AYE ARCHER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES COME. NAME AND ORGANIZATION. I THOUGHT. SO. ARE WE HEARING IS YOUR NAME. I AM AN OFFICIAL WELL LINGO LISTS AND YOU SUPPORT THE BILL I'M A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR OKAY I'M THAT'S THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL WE'VE HAD OUR TESTIMONY I'M SORRY. WE DON'T WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS TODAY SITE. HERE DIS WERE HIS TWO WITNESSES AND THEY USED UP ALL THE FOUR MINUTES SO. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANY OTHER. SUPPORTING THE BILL. OKAY ANYONE. DR ALEXANDRA CORONADO ORANGE COUNTY INTO THANK YOU. UP ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING AGAIN I'M MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ARMED WE BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO IS WELL INTENTIONED BUT UNNECESSARY. AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY I BELIEVE FROM SAN DIEGO POINTED OUT THE COURT CAN ALREADY CONSIDER WHETHER VICTIM WAS STRANGLED OR SUFFOCATED. SO THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY. HOWEVER ON PERHAPS EVEN MORE COMPELLING THE LEGISLATURE IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING COMPREHENSIVE BAIL REFORM. ARE UNDER S. B. TEN. AND. IN TERMS OF SP TENET REQUIRES THE COURT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED AND THE ALLEGED AND INJURY TO THE VICTIM. IT GOES FURTHER THAN AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT. THE COURT CAN CONSIDER NON FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF RELEASE ON GPS MONITORING EXCITED. AND IT PROVIDES FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND PRE TRIAL SERVICES WHICH DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. THE PROPONENTS OF AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY TWO OR TALKING ABOUT SO IN CONCLUSION WE WOULD ASK YOU NOT TO ON A VOTE FOR THIS BILL. BUT TO CONSIDER. S. B. TEN ON THE OVER. ARCHING CONSIDERATION OF THE BELL SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I MAY NOT IBM'S HAD OPPOSITION SORRY. A ARE THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH UP TO DISCUSSION ON BAIL I THINK MISTER HARPER YOU'VE BROUGHT TO LIGHT TO US. THAT WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THE PLIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO? ARE ARE ARE WILL BE CURSED WITH THE PROBLEM OF. WHAT IS NOT A STRANGULATION PERSONALLY THREATEN YOU WITH WEAPONS AND THINGS THAT NATURE AND WE REALLY NEED TO?

YOU MADE IT THROUGH WAS CABALLERO. ITEM NUMBER THIRTY ONE. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY TWO. MR STONE IS CHAIRING JUDICIOUS WIFE NOT HERE ON OVERSEE CHU IS. AND MR DALY WE JUST SKIPPED YOU SO. AND THEN MISTER GIBSON IS. NEXT IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP. COULD NEVER YOU READY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY TWO. WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE PROFILING OF MOTORCYCLE RIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT WAS DOWN NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT MOTORCYCLE PROFILING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND DESPITE MANY DECORATIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT IT IS WRONG. AND DOES NOT OCCUR THE PRACTICE OF TARGETING INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WRITING MOTORCYCLE CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. IN PROFILING INCIDENCES INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT JUST SUBJECTED TO UNLAWFUL STOPS BUT ARE ALSO QUESTION. THANK YOU. SEARCHED VOTERS ARE TAKEN STOPS OUR GUN POINT AND THEY'RE DETAINED. I'VE HEARD FROM MANY CALIFORNIANS ON THIS ISSUE INTO INCLUDING SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE. FELT VICTIMIZED FROM SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF OR MOTORCYCLE PROFILING. THIS INCLUDES A GENTLEMAN WHO RECENTLY CONTACTED MY OFFICE IN RELATIONS TO A TRAFFIC STOP BY LOCAL SHERIFFS WHICH OCCURRED IN LATE MARCH OF THIS YEAR. AFTER LOOKING. HE AT THE BASICALLY HE WAS STOPPED. BUT CLOUT AND. ASPERA'S LICENSE WHICH HE PRODUCED ANY WAS ASKED IF HE WAS USING MATH COACH COCAINE REPLIED NO AND HE WAS ASKED TO. EXIT. THE MOTORCYCLE OR GET OFF THE MOTORCYCLE. HE WAS. ASKED TO ASK ME I'D ME WEAPONS IN AGAIN IF YOU HAD USED ANY MATH OR COCAINE. HE WASN'T SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF ROADSIDE TESTS INCLUDING A URINE TEST AT ROADSIDE. THE RESULTS OF THE TEST SHOWED NO SIGNS OF DRUG OR USE IMPAIRMENT AND IS PROPERTY WAS RETURNED AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO. HE WAS NEVER ASKED TO SHOW HIS REGISTRATION PROOF OF INSURANCE OR WAS HE ADVISES TO THE REASON FOR THE INITIAL TRAFFIC STOP. THE LEGAL STANDARD OF PROBABLE CAUSE AND REASONABLE SUSPICION ARE USED TO DECIDE WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO STOP AN QUESTION A PERSON. THE BILL REAFFIRMS THE STANDARDS DOESN'T CHANGE THEM. AT ADDITIONALLY UP BASED ON A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE RIDERS MORSE MORE THAN HALF OF THEM RESPONDED. THAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCE AND JUSTIFY TRAFFIC STOPS. AT ONE OR MORE TIMES THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE BY OFFICERS A GENERALIZE STEREOTYPES. BASED ON THE FACT THAT A PERSON RIGHT TO MOTORCYCLE ARE WARY WEARS CERTAIN MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING AND AND AS WE ALL KNOW I'M OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE SUBJECTED THAT TO THIS KIND OF A TREATMENT. ARE A REALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY THAT REPRESENT ALL WALKS OF LIFE THERE'S DOCTORS THEIR LAWYERS THERE'S TEACHERS BUSINESS OWNER OWNERS AND IN MY COMMUNITY THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF. VIETNAM VETERANS. ALL INDIVIDUALS DESERVE TO BE JUDGED ON SPECIFIC ACTIONS OR BEHAVIOR NOT SOLELY ON THEIR PARENTS SO I EXPERIENCED IT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. AND WITH ME TO TEST TRANSPORTER NICHOLAS HARRIS WESTERN STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE ASSOCIATION AND DAVID DEVERAUX FROM THE MOTORCYCLE PROFILING PROJECT. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN LACKEY AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I'M NICHOLAS HARRIS I'M THE WESTERN STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE AMERICAN MOTORCYCLIST ASSOCIATION. AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW THE AMA HAS LONG ADVOCATED FOR THE RIGHTS OF MOTORCYCLE RIDERS AND MOTORCYCLISTS AND AND PART OF WHAT I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT TODAY A LITTLE BIT IS NOT JUST RIDERS BUT. PEOPLE THAT ARE SEEN AS MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIASTS MAYBE THEY'RE NOT EVEN ON A MOTORCYCLE IN THE TIME THAT THEY'RE. JUST PERCEIVED AS A WRITER AND OR AS AS AN ENTHUSIAST. THEY MADE ITS MEMBERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MOTORCYCLE PROFILING ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS PASSED IN A A VERY SPECIFIC POSITION PAPER ON IT LIKE WE DO ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES. WE FEEL LIKE. THAT TARGETING OF MOTORCYCLISTS IS IS SIMPLY UNFAIR AND IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF STATES PASSED SIMILAR BILLS THERE'S THE LEGISLATION IN WASHINGTON MARYLAND AND NEW JERSEY. IN ADDITION WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF OTHER EFFORTS AND YOUR ADDRESSING CHECKPOINTS AND OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET MOTORCYCLES AGAIN. I THE A MAY STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE PROFILING MOTORCYCLES BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND FEELS THE VAST MAJORITY OF RIDERS AND ENTHUSIASTS ARE UPSTANDING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. MOTORCYCLIST MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIASTS REPRESENT THE FULL GAMUT OF AMERICANS AND WE FEEL THEY SHOULD BE JUDGED ON THEIR SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS AND ACTIONS AND NOT ON THEIR CHOSEN MODE OF TRANSPORTATION OR ASSOCIATION WITH OTHERS. WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT. I MY NAME IS DAVID DEVERAUX I'M SPOKESPERSON FOR THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CLUBS AND ALSO FOUNDER THE MOTORCYCLE PROFILING PROJECT WHICH YOU TO EVER ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO ADVANCING THE RIGHTS MOTORCYCLISTS. THE ISSUE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS A SIMPLE ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL'S APPEARANCE OR THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THIS ISN'T TRIVIALIZING ISSUE DISCRIMINATION THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM INCLUDING THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS SPECIFICALLY EXTENDED FIRST MEMBER PROTECTION THE MOTORCYCLE CLUB COLORS AND MOTORCYCLE CLUB ASSOCIATIONS. THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION THAT HAS ZERO BUDGETARY IMPACT AND WOULD IMMEDIATELY SOLVE PERVASIVE PROBLEM CALIFORNIA. THE CHP MAINTAINS THE PROFILING IS NOT OCCURRING AND THEY POINT TO A STATISTIC THAT SAYS ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MOTORCYCLISTS IN CALIFORNIA OR CITED EVERY YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T BEGIN TO REVEAL THE PROFILING PROBLEM THE MAJORITY OF PROFILING STOPS OCCUR AS FISHING EXPEDITIONS OR INVESTIGATORY STOPS AND THEY DON'T RESULT IN A CITATION THAT DON'T RESULT IN ARRESTS. AND IN FACT THE SURVEY THAT WAS REFERRED TO THE NATIONAL MOTORCYCLE PROFOUND SURVEY SAYS THAT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF MOTORCYCLISTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPERIENCED A PROFILING STOP WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. WITHOUT RECEIVING A TICKET OR CITATION THAT'S A FAR MORE SUPERIOR STATISTIC THERE'S A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT DEVIATION IN THAT STATISTIC IS THE MOST ACCURATE STATISTIC THAT EXIST. IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THAT. IN EVENT THAT HAPPENED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO DEMONSTRATES WHAT HAPPENS FIFTY INDIVIDUAL SOME OF WHICH WERE IN THIS ROOM. GATHERED TO HAVE A MEETING ABOUT ADVANCING THIS LEGISLATION IN ALL FIFTY OF THEM WERE PULLED OVER LEAVING THE MEETING IN VENTURA COUNTY ALL FIFTY OF THEM NOT A SINGLE CITATION GIVEN. NOT A SINGLE PERSON ARRESTED PURELY PULLED OVER FOR INVEST YOUR STOPPED. THAT'S NOT COLLEGE. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THAT LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT THE PROPORTION MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION LIKE PERSONA MOTORCYCLE ROBS A BANK. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPREHEND THAT PERSON NOT TRUE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS IN THE WORDING OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN. BY REQUIRING THE INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE SO PACIFIC IN PARTICULAR REASONABLE SUSPICION ON THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AT THAT MATCHES SUBJECT DESCRIPTION. THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ABLE TO BE APPREHENDED INDEPENDENT OF THAT I THINK PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION IS APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF DISCRIMINATION THAT IS AFFECTING FORTY SIX PERCENT. OF MOTORCYCLISTS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE POPULATION MOTORCYCLISTS HERE'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT TOUCHES A MASSIVE POPULATION. IS A SIMPLE COST FREE SOLUTION AND IT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE LEGISLATION UNANIMOUSLY PASSED IN WASHINGTON MARYLAND AND THERE CONCURRENT BILLS IN US CONGRESS NOW THAT THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. A CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT. ADVANCEMENT OF THIS MOVEMENT APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHTY OKAY. NAME AND ORGANIZATION ONLY THERE'S JUST.

HOLLISTER CALIFORNIA AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SU MCFADDEN'S BIKE RIDER. CALIFORNIA RESIDENT I SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU MA'AM. UNDER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CORY. MORNING MIXTURE FELL STILL. THANK YOU SIR. WE HEAR ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION COURSE ALSO. IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS YOU NOW CSUS. I THINK CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. PROFILING IS THIS NOTION IS BEING DESCRIBED IS ALREADY PROHIBITED. IF NOT BY STATUTE CERTAINLY BY CASE LAW. THERE'S A LONG LINE OF CASE LAW THAT INDICATES THAT AN OFFICER MUST BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE. SPECIFIC FACTS TO JUSTIFY A STOPPER TENSION. UM DESSES NOT NEW OR. MYSTIFYING CONCEPT. IT SO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW. MAKING SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY LEGAL. MORE ILLEGAL WILL STOP ANY SORT OF PERCEIVED BEHAVIOR THAT'S GOING ON. A I THINK WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. AND AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES DID POINT OUT IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE. YOU HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD PREVENT AN OFFICER FROM ENGAGING WITH A POTENTIAL SUSPECT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST PULLING SOMEONE OVER ON A MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON A MOTORCYCLE BUT IN A SITUATION. WHERE AN OFFICER IS PATROLLING NEIGHBORHOOD AND GETS A CALL? AGAIN AS THE WITNESS POINTED OUT. THAT A BANK HAS BEEN ROBBED AND THAT THE SUSPECT WAS SEEN FLEEING ON A MOTORCYCLE. IN THIS CONTEXT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALIZED SUSPICION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IF YOU SAW A MOTORCYCLE SPEEDING AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION. MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION IS THAT ENOUGH INDIVIDUALIZED SUSPICION TO JUSTIFY A STOP AND IF IT'S NOT THEN YOU HAVE AN OFFICER SECOND GUESSING A SITUATION. WHO KNOWS WHERE THAT PERSON IS HEADING NEXT? BUT AGAIN IT IT SUBJECTS AN OFFICER TO AN AMBIGUOUS SORT OF STANDARDS OUTSIDE OF WHAT STATUTE CASE LAW AND THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS REQUIRE. A IN TERMS OF WAYS TO DEAL WITH ANYTHING THAT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS AN UNLAWFUL SEARCH. IMPEDING POLICE WORK ON THE FRONT AND WILL CREATE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND WERE POSTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. UP ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER LACKEY CERTAINLY. FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT OF THE BILLS IN MARYLAND WASHED AND THEY'RE BOTH TRAINING BILLS AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SUING LONG FORSMAN OFFICERS. SO SO MUCH DIFFERENT BILL IN BOTH OF THOSE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO CONFIRM IS THAT. FOR ANY. MISCONDUCT OR ANY UNFAIR PROFILING. AS WAS POINTED OUT BY THE OPPOSITION WITNESS. IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S NOT OKAY AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS. AND AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FOR EIGHTEEN IN MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE TAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY. AND THEY ARE FULLY INVESTIGATED AND THEY ARE. OF DIRT THERE'S PUNITIVE ACTION TAKEN IF THERE IS AN INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF THE OFFICER. SO. I THINK THAT THIS BILL. IS MISGUIDED AND I I THINK THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT. WE HAVE A ROAD IN OUR CONFIDENCE BUT WE WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN BUILDING. TRUST BETWEEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THOSE WHO WERE. FEELING THAT THEY'RE BEING UNFAIRLY PROFILE. THANK. QUIRK SO WE CAN. I KNOW THIS GOVERNOR. HE WILL. I THINK THERE'S IN NINETY EIGHT PERCENT CHANCE TO VETO THE BILL BECAUSE IT MAKES SOMETHING ILLEGAL THE CHARTIER LEGAL HOWEVER I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THIS TRAINING WOULD BE ONE. GATHERING STATISTICS ON HOW OFTEN. MOTORCYCLISTS ARE STOPPED VERSUS HOW OFTEN THEIR CITED COMPARED TO. AUTOS IS ANOTHER APPROACH YOU MIGHT TAKE. BUT THE IBM AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT WITHOUT THE SUPPORTERS THAT IT IS AN ISSUE. I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT ULTIMATELY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THIS PASSED INTO LAW. TO GET NOW BE VOTING AYE. THANK YOU. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THAT CAME HERE TODAY THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE I PROBABLY HEAR THIS. OUT IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE I'M. AT ITS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I HEAR THE MOST ABOUT. I HAD IT CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FROM ONE OF THE CITIES IN MY DISTRICT WHO SAYS THAT HALF OF THE TIME HE GOES OUT ON HIS MOTORCYCLE HE'S HE IS STOP THIS IS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. PEOPLE KNOW I'M IN THE COMMUNITY AND STILL GETTING STOPPED AND SO. OBVIOUSLY IS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT NEEDS A RESOLUTION AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES AND. I AM WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND WE'LL SEE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WHERE THEY END UP COMING DOWN ON THIS BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU NAM. AND. HOPEFULLY YOU. WE WORKED THROUGH THE CONCERNS OF OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS. REAL. CRIMINALS AND THEIR ATTEMPT TO EVADE AND THAT WE DAHLE BLENDED TOURED GETTING CONFUSED. AND WE DON'T. THINK ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS COULD YOU WANT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS. TO WHERE WE'D WE CAPTURE FEWER AND FEWER AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR TENT THAT'S WHY I'M. SAME AS LIKE. HOPE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM. I. AS SOMEONE. WHOSE PROFILE. I MEAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I WANT ESSIEN HARVARD. BUT WHEN I GO TO HIGH IN STORE I GET FOLLOW. NINE SO I NOTICE LIKE AND I CAN TELL. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AFTER AMERICAN A LATINO THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME. A LOT OF TIMES. SINCE I DON'T SEE IT THEY DON'T SEE IT. AND SO I I AM. SO WHEN I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU BE IN PROFILE I THINK WE NEED TO GET. WE NEVER HAVE A DISCUSSION OF WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAY AND JUST TALK IT THROUGH AND I THINK PART OF THIS IS WHAT MISTER CORPORATE ST. LET'S GET TO THE ROOT THIS AS WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO ROOT OF RACIAL PROFILING WITH. TRAINING BETTER TRAINING. AS ETHNIC SENSITIVITY AND OF I GUESS MOTORCYCLES AND TO TO BE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT. BUT THAT YOU SEE SOMEONE. AND YOU DON'T SEE THEM A CERTAIN WAY. BECAUSE STATE DRESSED A CERTAIN WAY AND ARE THEY HAVE CERTAIN. THINGS HONOR JACKET SHOULD MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS. AND SO I'M RECOMMENDED AYE BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. YOU. YOU WALK TO THE CONCERNS THAT WE WE DON'T CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT INHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM DOING. THEIR JOBS. ABSOLUTELY. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK. I AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THE MEASURES ON CALL. VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME. DAVID. TO. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. THE. I WAS GONNA SAY. SURE YOUR HOUSE. BUT. I BARELY HAVE DRIVEN THEM ALL OUT. YEAH YEAH. VOTE. I THINK WE'RE CLOSE THE DOOR RIGHT ABOUT. NOW. YOU CAN GO MISCHIEF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE AND LET ME JUST START BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR IN DURRANCE. AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN TO ADDRESS THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG. I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE APPRECIATES THE INJUSTICE OF THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG BUT. I WILL JUST STATE SHORTLY OF WHAT WE ALL KNOW THAT AFTER VICTIM HAS BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. A COLLECTION OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE INVOLVES INCREDIBLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES. AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN A RAPE KIT REMAINS UNTESTED IT DENIES JUSTICE TO SURVIVORS. IT. RE TRAUMATIZE IS. EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IT ALLOWS CRIMINALS ROAM FREE AND THREATENS PUBLIC SAFETY. AFTER YEARS A SET BACKS CALIFORNIA'S FINALLY TAKING STRIDES TO ADDRESS THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG AND I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ARE OF MY BILL LAST YEAR AB FORTY ONE TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR WHY SOME KIDS. ARE NOT BEING TESTED AFTER GENERATE FIRST OF THIS YEAR. BUT WE KNOW THAT EVEN WITH. THE BILLS OF THE PAST THERE'S MUCH LEFT TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND. THE NATIONAL PRESS WILL TELL YOU THAT EVEN STATES LIKE TEXAS AND KENTUCKY OUR HEAD OF CALIFORNIAN TERMS OF ADDRESSING. RAPE KIT BACKLOG REFORM. THIS BILL WILL TAKE US ONE STEP CLOSER TO ELIMINATING THE BACKLOG BY REQUIRING ALL AGENCIES AND FACILITIES. THAT RECEIVE MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT OR OR STORE. SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF KIDS IN THEIR POSSESSION TO REPORT THIS DATA TO DOJ WHO IN TURN IS REQUIRED TO REPORT. TO US IN THE PUBLIC ARE ON THE DATA OF EXACTLY WHAT THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG LOOKS LIKE. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE BACKLOG IN OUR STATE. OUR THAT IS NOT HOW THE MOST POPULOUS STATE IN OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE HANDLING ARE RAPE. OF CRIME EVIDENCE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S AMPLE FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS BACKLOG KITS BUT TO APPLY FOR THOSE FUNDS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE KIDS A HALF SITTING ON THEIR SHELVES. ARE YOU OF THIS COMMITTEE CAN CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR COMMITMENT BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. PARTICULAR ONE THANK DA O'MALLEY AND REPRESENTING HER TODAY IS JASON CHEN. WHEN A MORTAR CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JASON CHAN I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HERE REPRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY A CO SPONSOR OF AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN. SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE TOOK THE FIRST STEP AND CONDUCTED AN AUDIT OF ALL UNTESTED SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EVIDENCE AND PROPERTY ROOMS. THAT AUDIT UNCOVERED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND UNTESTED KITS. WE ARE PROUD TO REPORT THAT WE'VE SENT SENT ALL UNTESTED KITS TO BE TESTED IN THERE'S CURRENTLY NO BACKLOG IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. WERE ALSO PROUD TO PUT MEASURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT NO BACKLOGS FORM AGAIN AND THAT ALL CONTEMPORANEA SKITS ARE TESTED IN A TIMELY MANNER. UNFORTUNATELY THE BACKLOG THAT WE UNCOVERED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WAS NOT UNIQUE NATIONALLY IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. UNTESTED KIDS SITTING ON PROPERTY IN EVIDENCE ROOMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THAT REPRESENTS FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT HAD TO UNDERGO INVASIVE AND INTRUSIVE EXAMINATIONS OF THEIR BODIES ONLY TO LATER FIND OUT THAT THAT EVIDENCE WAS NEVER PROCESS. DNA IS AN AMAZING FORENSIC TOOL. THROUGH TESTING SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES ACROSS AMERICA SEXUAL SOLVE CRIMES HAVE BEEN SOLVED AND OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. SERIAL OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CRIMES MANY DECADES AND CROSSING STATE LINES INDIAN A HAS EXONERATED THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGLY CONVICTED. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE NANCY O'MALLEY HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ADVOCATING FOR AND SECURING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TEST PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. BUT. STILL TOO MANY. SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN OUR STATE ARE NOT RECEIVING THE JUSTICE THAT THEY DESERVE THE FIRST STEP TO CORRECT THIS IS TO CONDUCT A STATEWIDE AUDIT OF UNTESTED KITS. AND A. B. THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES. SUPPORT. SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SHOPPING WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. AS CHAIR RYAN JIM OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG IN OUR COUNTY.

THIS BILL REQUIRES THE COMMISSION ON POLICE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING COURSE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. FOCUSING ON HOW TO RESPOND TO CHILD VICTIMS OF COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL TO US STATISTICS AS OF A COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CASES OF SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS. ACCOUNTING FOR OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL THE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES IN OUR STATE. THESE NUMBERS ARE PRESUMED TO BE LOW DUE TO UNDER IDENTIFYING IN UNDER REPORTING. POLICE OFFICER TRAINING SPECIFIC TO COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN WILL HELP INCREASE THE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING. OF CHILD VICTIMS OF SUCH SEXUAL EXPLOITATION TAKING THE CHILD OUT OF ABUSIVE SITUATIONS AND CONNECTING. IN HER TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. CURRENTLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ARE NOT AT OF FULLY TRAINED. ON. COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN. I'M WORKING WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IN HOPES OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE RAISED INCLUDING THE COST FACTORS. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OUR JULIE MCCORMICK OF THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. AND. HANA HAILEY FROM THE WEST COAST CHILDREN'S CLINIC. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. A I AM JULIE MCCORMICK AN ATTORNEY AND POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER CALIFORNIA. THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPENDENCY COURT IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTIES. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HIM HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY EXPLOITED. MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ABOUT THE CURSE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. DECRIMINALIZATION ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND MUST BE PAIRED WITH AN ALTERNATE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AN ARRAY OF SERVICE OPTIONS. IN ORDER TO ROUTE TO REALIZE THE FULL IMPACT OF RECENT POLICY CHANGES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MUST UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANT ROLE THEY PLAY. IN POSITIVELY ALTERING THE COURSE OF COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN'S LIVES. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS AND LOS ANGELES HAVE CONTINUALLY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING AND THE IMPACT TRAINING HAS HAD AREN'T OFFICERS BEING BETTER ABLE TO PROTECT VICTIMS. WE SEEM FOR THE LOS ANGELES FIRST RESPONDER PROTOCOL IS THAT WHEN THESE CHILDREN INTERACT WITH A TRAINED OFFICER WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR NEEDS AND TRAUMA AND IS FOCUSED ON THEIR SAFETY. IT RESULTS IN THE CHILD BEING MORE RECEPTIVE TO SERVICES AND INCREASES THE CHANCE THEY WILL AVOID FURTHER ACTS. EXPLOITATION. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THE TREMENDOUS VALUE IN THIS APPROACH THEY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING THESE CHILDREN'S NEEDS. AND ALSO THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING CASES AGAINST PROMINENT TRAFFICKERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REDUCE ADDITIONAL VICTIMIZATION. LASTLY A GROUP OF SURVIVOR ADVOCATES WHO CONSULT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IDENTIFIED LACK OF TRAINING AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT IN THE STATE. WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TWO NINE NINE TWO AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MY NAME IS HANNAH HALEY ON THE POLICY ASSOCIATED WEST COAST CHILDREN'S CLINIC. WEST COAST AS A CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WE SERVE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED USE PER YEAR MOST OF WHOM ARE IN FOSTER CARE AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WE'VE HAD A SPECIALIZED PROGRAM FOR SEXUALLY EXPLOITED YOUTH. WHICH HAS PROVIDED SERVICES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY USED EACH YEAR. INTO DOESN'T SIXTEEN WE ALSO DEVELOPED INVALIDATED A SCREENING TOOL TO IMPROVE IDENTIFICATION OF SEXUALLY EXPLOITED YOUTH WHICH IS NOW IN USE IN NEARLY A HUNDRED AGENCIES IN FIVE STATES. AND WHICH WE'VE TRAINED OVER FIVE THOUSAND PROFESSIONALS TO USE. MANY OF THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE DISTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IN THE PAST INTERACTION WITH BOND FORSTMANN OFTEN RESULTED IN ARRESTS IN ON INCARCERATION. ONE YOUNG YOUNG PERSON SAD BEING ARRESTED REINFORCES THAT I'D BE BETTER OFF STICKING WITH MY EXPLOITER HE SAID THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT I WOULD GO TO JAIL IF I LEFT HIM AND THAT NO ONE ELSE CARES. BUT FROM OUR WORK PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES TO CREATE INTER AGENCY PROTOCOLS TO SERVE EXPLOITED YOUTH WE KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR CRITICAL PARTNERS IN OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND PROTECT EXPLOITED YOUTH. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS LAKE NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS THERAPISTS AND SCHOOL STAFF ARE ON THE FRONT LINES IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ARE IN A PRIME POSITION TO IDENTIFY EXPLOITED YOUTH AND GET THEM HOW. BUT THE EXISTING TRAINING IS TOO BRIEF TO ADEQUATE ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IDENTIFICATION ENGAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING. SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OCCURS IN SHOWS UP VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY CONSIDER SEXUAL ABUSE AND IT MERITS ITS OWN TRAINING CONTENT. WE HAVE NEW RESEARCH ON WHICH INDICATORS BEST HELP US IDENTIFY YOU TOUR EXPLOITER EXPLOITED AND WE HAVE GROWING UNDERSTANDING ABOUT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. THE LAWS HAVE ALSO CHANGED AND IT'S IMPORTANT THOSE BE REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT CURRICULA. THIS BILL WOULD ADD TRAINING TOPICS THAT FOCUS ON RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS OF EXPLOITATION AND GETTING USED HELP TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING TRAINING. AND TO FURTHER OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS TO PROTECT YOU FROM EXPLOITATION SO I RESPECTFULLY URGE ARRIVAL AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED ATTENTION ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THINK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AND ORGANIZATION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

DANIEL MAILLET CALIFORNIA LAND TO CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN. OPPOSITION. CHAIR RYAN CHAIRMAN WITH THE IRISH SUCH ASSOCIATION WE DON'T HAVE A. POSITION ON THIS WE SUPPORT THE BILLING CONCEPT HOWEVER. WORDS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUNDING AND THE TIME THE WHOLE TAKE TO TRAIN EVERYBODY THANK YOU. THANK YOU HOPEFULLY TO SELF SELECT THE SAME PICTURE. ONE OF ANY THAT'S MISTER CHAIR UP MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COURSE ALSO ARAB OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO TRAINING. WHERE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO TRAINING ABOUT SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THIS IS ANOTHER UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT REQUIRES TRAINING? WITHOUT ANY SORT OF. AND NOTION OF WHAT IT COSTS NOT ONLY TO THE COMMISSION ON POST. TO DEVELOP THIS TRAINING. BUT ALSO TO THE AGENCIES WHO ARE. GOING TO BE FORCED WITHOUT FUNDING TO PAY FOR IT TO. SEND OFFICERS. TWO LOCATIONS TO TAKE THIS TRAINING. TO HAVE OFFICERS WORKED OVERTIME FOR THE BACKFILL FOR THOSE OFFICERS WHO ARE OUT DOING THE TRAINING. IT ALSO WILL INCREASE THE MINIMUM LENGTH OF THE BASIC ACADEMY WHICH ARE HE STANDS AT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOURS AGAIN THAT'S A MINIMUM SO WE'RE TALKING A MINIMUM SIXTEEN WEEK ACADEMY ALREADY. AND AND FRANKLY THERE IS ALREADY TRAINING CONTEMPLATED. IN THE EXISTING BASE ACADEMY LEARNING DOMAINS NINE AND TEN DEAL WITH. SEX CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN MAY REVERSE THE ORDER THERE THERE ARE GUIDELINES BY POST ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRAINING. I'M SO THERE'S ALREADY INFORMATION AND TRAINING AVAILABLE. THERE'S A VARYING DEGREE OF MANDATES AS TO WHAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED AND PERMITTED. I I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE AUTHOR AND POST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOMETHING THAT. COMES OUT OF THIS THAT IS NOT. DUPLICATIVE AND. HAS. SOME RESPECT FOR THE NOTION THAT THERE ARE UNFUNDED COST TO THIS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD BE PROVIDING THAT FUNDING BUT THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT UNFORTUNATELY. SO I AGREE WITH YOUR CONCERNS AS YOU HAVE STATED ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. THAT'S REALLY THE KEY HERE IS. GETTING SOMETHING FUNDED AND FORCING THE BILL AT THIS POINT AS IT SITS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE THAT SO WE ASK YOU KNOW WHAT. THANK YOU. BUT ANY. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS ARE. TO QUIRK. SAID THE OPPOSITION I'M. FIVE I BELIEVE YOU REALIZE RAISES IMPORTANT ISSUES. ARE YOU WORKING WITH POST CURRENTLY YES WE ARE WHERE WE'RE HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH POST. WE'VE HAD CORDIAL PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION. AN I BELIEVE OUR GOALS ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR WE'D LIKE TO IMPROVE THE TRAINING. WITHOUT ADDING SUBSTANTIAL COST TO THE SYSTEM. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND TRY TO FIND A SWEET SPOT. WHERE THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED OKAY SEAT WOULD YOU BE TRYING TO KEEP THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS OPPOSE TRAINING THAT'S? DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST COST DRIVER I THINK POSSIBLY. ANSWER QUIRK POSSIBLY. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT. TODAY ON THAT BUT I I THINK THAT'S A A WORTHY GOAL AND IT I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE DOABLE. SO ALSO POSSIBLE OKAY THANK YOU I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND YOU MAY CLOSE. I I WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND. AGAIN ALL REPEAT MY COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO TRY TO FIND THE BEST A. THE BEST OF MY COMMON GROUND ON THIS ON THIS BILL. GREG I. BELIEVE MISTER QUIRK IS GOING TO MOVE TO THE BILL UP YET. THANK OF BUT IT. THIS IS AN AYE. AND IT. BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE. OF I'M NOT OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE I'M ON THE BUDGET SIDE BUT YOU HAVE A FIVE YEAR AND SO IN THIS GOES TO. APPROPRIATIONS YEAH WHICH YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CONCERNED WHEN YOU GET THERE THAT YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FUNDING PLANET SOURCE. SO THAT THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF SO AYE WILL. OBVIOUSLY BE LOOKING. AT HOW RISK IS FUNDED DONE BUT EVERYTHING ON THE PROGRAM ITSELF. I WANT A BETTER PROGRAM I DON'T WANT THIS PROGRAM VERSES THAT PROGRAM LET'S. COMBINE ALL THE BEST PRACTICES INTO ONE PROGRAM ANIME EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS THERE WHAT IS LEFT OUT. THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE AND THE ONE THAT'S ALREADY GIVEN. AT POST TRAINING. BAD BEFORE FOR ME IS THE BEST THE BEST TRAINING. NOT. THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER BUT WHAT ARE THE ON THE PRINCIPLES AND THE POLICY IN THE GUIDELINES THAT YOU NEED SO THAT WHEN THEY GO OUT. INTO THE FIELD ON DELTA BETTER OFFICES PREDICTOR THEY'RE BETTER WITH DEALING WITH TOM. THIS THIS POPULATION AND SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE A REAL. SKY XIN ABOUT WHAT THE ELEMENTS ARE IN INDUSTRY PROGRAM. SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AND I GUARANTEE THAT'LL HAPPEN MISTER CHAIR. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY TOO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I GOT A VIDEO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. KILEY NOT VOTING QUIRK.

FIFTEEN WHICH SEEKS TO INTRODUCE THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS. ON VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOTERS RIGHTS IN HOPES THAT HELPING THEM WILL FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA INCARCERATIONS EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ITS JAILS AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OR ARE ON THAT SENTENCE. THIS IS A LARGE COMMUNITY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY. BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. THERE IS OFTEN AN ASSUMPTION BY MANY PEOPLE THAT IF YOU HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED YOU HAVE LOST YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. ON DUE TO EITHER. MISINFORMATION OR LACK OF INFORMATION MEDIA WHO ARE BEHIND BARS DO NOT KNOW THEY CAN REGISTER TO VOTE. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES STATE AND LOCAL JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES TO ASSIST IN VOTER REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AGE WHO ARE WHO ARE OF AGE. AND ARE NOT SERVING A FELONY SENTENCE THIS BILL WILL. ACTS SIMILAR PROVISIONS. FOR ADULTS REQUIRING EACH COUNTY JAIL TO ALLOW AT LEAST ONE ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTY JAIL. THE THE PROGRAMS WOULD INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED. TO INFORMATION ABOUT VOTERS RIGHTS PROVIDING A VOTER REGISTRATION TO ELIGIBLE VOTERS AND ASSISTING ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN RETURNING A COMPLETED VOTER REGISTRATION CARD ONTO THE COUNTY OFFICIAL WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY.

AND WE ALREADY ATTEMPT TO DO SOME VOTER REGISTRATION AND EDUCATION INSIDE OF LOCAL JAILS. IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE'S INTEREST IN HAVING OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE INCARCERATED LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE. DEMOCRACY WHILE THEIR REQUESTS WAITED MAYBE THEY'LL COME OUT BETTER AND ABLE TO FUNCTION. A ON THE OUTSIDE AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHILE THEY'RE THERE THAT THEY STILL HAVE THEIR RIGHTS. GIVEN TO THEM TO PARTICIPATE AND LEARN THAT DEMOCRACY IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MAYBE IT'LL BE A DETERRENT IN THE FUTURE AND THEY WILL BE BETTER CITIZENS ON OUTSIDE SO WE STRONGLY. SPONSOR AND URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS BILL WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THEM SO WE ASK YOU TO VOTE ACT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TARA MEMBERS ESTHER LIN DIRECTOR OF A SAY SO CAL JAILS PROJECT BY MONITOR CONDITIONS IN THE LA COUNTY JAILS THE LARGEST JAIL IN THE COUNTRY WITH OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. OF WHICH FORTY PERCENT ARE PRE TRIAL AND EIGHTY PERCENT ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RIGHT TO REGISTERED INCARCERATED COMMUNITIES LARGE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESS DUE TO LACK OF INFORMATION LIMITED ACCESS TO VOTING MATERIALS. AND INCONSISTENT AND BIG VOTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES ALMOST SIXTY TWO PERCENT INCARCERATED POPULATIONS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE WHICH MEANS AND LA COUNTY JAILS ALONE THAT'S MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. THE ACLU OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UNLOCK THE BOW PROJECT WITH LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. HAVE REGISTERED OVER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH MORE THAN HALF BEING FIRST TIME REGISTRANTS. EDUCATION BEING A VITAL COMPONENT TO INCREASING ENGAGEMENT THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE FIFTEEN. NOW BRIEFLY SHARED THEIR EXPERIENCES FROM OUR UNLOCK THE VOTE. AT MEN'S CENTRAL JAIL WE FINISH COMPLETING A YOUNG MAN'S REGISTRATION PACKET FIRST TIME WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSING MAJEL HE WAS GREETED BY SOUNDS OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE BY STORM MATES. AT THE WOMEN'S FACILITY WE WERE GREETED BY AUDIBLE YESES. BECAUSE OF WHY WE TOLD THE WONDER WHAT WHY WERE THERE AFTER WE COMPLETED ONE WOMAN'S REGISTRATION SHE HUGGED THE VOTING MATERIALS CLOSER CHEST. AND WITH THE BIG TO CSUS GRAN AND TEARS IN HER EYES SHE SAID YES I CAN FINALLY VOTE. LASTLY AFTER A GIVEN UGLY AFRICAN MAN TO UNLOCK THE VOTE BROCHURE I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO SHAKE HIS. HINSON SHIRLEY TO BEND HIS WRIST TOWARDS ME. SO I COULD SEE HIS WRIST BAND THEY DO THIS FREQUENTLY INSIDE THE JAILS FOR COUNT TO GET THE MEDICATIONS ARE VERIFY THEIR NAME MATCHES OUR BOOKING NUMBER. I TOLD MY DIDN'T TO SEE HAS WRISTBAND I JUST WANT TO SHAKE HIS HAND. HE SAID. PEOPLE DON'T WANT SUGAR HANDS IT'S LIKE NO HUMAN CONTACT FOR US IN HERE AFTER WE SHOOK HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID MISS ESTHER. THANK YOU. THESE ARE NOT UNIQUE OR EVEN RARE OCCURRENCES AS THIS IS WHAT WE SEE IN HERE EVERY DAY WHEN WE'RE INSIDE THE JAILS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THINK YOU. THANK YOU. OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT PAINTING IF YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IT'S A SELF FILLER HERE PRETTY BUSY DAY. THOSE DAYS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORSO'S ALONG BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION UP REGRETTABLY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE'RE NOT AGAINST VOTER EDUCATION OR. ASSISTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE WITH VOTING I THINK THIS BILL IDENTIFIES OR WE WRITE EFFORT TO KEEP PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL ONE. THE BILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY INTERNAL EFFORTS AT VOTER EDUCATION IN FROM IN INFORMING INMATES ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS. THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST AND SO COUNTIES ARE ALREADY UNDERTAKING. PROGRAMS TO HELP IN MAKES VOTE OFTENTIMES THEY WILL ASSIST WITH GETTING REGISTRATION AFFIDAVIT THEY WILL. TURN IT INTO THE CLERK FOR THE INMATE THEY WILL HAVE. DAYS WHERE THE CLERK OF THE COUNTY WILL COME TO THE FACILITY AND GATHER REGISTRATION AFFIDAVITS. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE SIMILAR EVENTS WHEN IT'S TIME TO VOTE SO TO HELP RETURN A BALLOT BY MAIL THEY'LL PAY FOR THE STAMP SOMETIMES SOMETIMES IN MAY PAYS FOR THE STAMP. SOMETIMES THE CLERK WILL COME DOWN TO COLLECT BALLOTS SO THEIR RD EFFORTS ARE ON GOING ON THIS IN THIS BILL SORT OF. JUST GLOSSES OVER THE FACT THAT THAT HAPPENS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. THE BILL'S LANGUAGE I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT TOO RESTRICTIVE IN. THE CONTEXT OF MANDATING THAT A GROUP BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO A FACILITY SO THE SHERIFF HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARE AND CUSTODY OF THE INMATES. ARE BUT ALSO FOR THE SAFETY OF THE FACILITY AND STAFF AND THE BILL SAYS IN ITS OWN WORDS BUT AT LEAST ONE GROUP MAIN MUST BE ALLOWED TO ENTER TO PERFORM THIS VOTER EDUCATION. SO IN A STRICT READING OF THE LANGUAGE OF ONLY ONE GROUP WERE TO COME FORWARD TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THE SHERIFF IS OSTENSIBLY OBLIGATED TO ALLOW THAT PARTICULAR GROUP BEEN. IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY ACCOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL SAFETY SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT PARTICULAR GROUP THAT SEEKING ENTRY TO PROVIDE VOTER EDUCATION. THE BILL IS SILENT ON ANY SORT OF AUTHORITY THAT THE SHERIFF MIGHT HAVE. PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THE FACILITIES WE THINK AT THE VERY LEAST THOSE TWO THINGS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL OR RELEASED REFERENCE. AGAIN IT IT IT'S JUST I THINK TOO STRICT IN THE LANGUAGE I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY FORWARD BUT THE WAY THE BILL IS TODAY WE'D ASK YOU KNOW WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER ANY. OTHER IN OPPOSITION OR ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE COURT. UP CHAU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. I THINK YOU DO WELL TO RESPOND TO THE SECURITY ISSUE. ARM. THE AYE AND IF THEY WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EFFORT TO BE DONE ALREADY THAT'S EASY TO DO YOU COULD PUT THAT IN THE FINDINGS. BUT TO THE OPTICALLY TO THE PROPONENTS WHAT SORT OF PROBLEMS ARE YOU HAVING NOW GETTING INTO JAILS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE NEED FOR THE BELL. MUSLIM. SO IN LA ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND COALITION MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY TRAINED AND. THERE'S A BACK ON CLEARANCE PROCESS THAT THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEY CONDUCT SO THEY DO A CUSTODY US SUPPORT TRAINING THEY ALSO DO A A VERY EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND. CHECK PROCESS CONTRACTED TAKES BETWEEN TWO WEEKS TO ONE AND A HALF MONTHS FOR SOMETIMES A CLEARANCE PROCESS TO BE DONE BUT ONCE THEY ARE CLEAR THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE ENTRY INSIDE. TO THE JAIL FACILITIES AND WE HAVE WORKED VERY WELL WITH THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AT LEAST IN THAT PROCESS. YET BUT SO. DO YOU HAVE COUNTIES WHERE IT DOESN'T WORK WELL WHAT IS THE NEED FOR THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S. IN BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY NAME NAMES BUT I THEIR HACK COUNTIES WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY. AND WHERE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT YOU DO NOT THINK IS DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE REGISTRATION I I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT ISSUE PARTICULARLY AS YOU GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. HE'S ALWAYS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ISSUE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WE ARE SEEING VERY INCONSISTENT PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE IN FACT JUST A AN ADJOINING. COUNTY TO LA THEIR VERY DIFFERING POLICIES IN FACT TWO OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES HAVE OPPOSING POLICIES WHICH ADD TO THE CONFUSION IN TERMS OF VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTING ELIGIBILITY BUT ALSO VOTING PROCESSES INSIDE THE FACILITIES. SO THIS BILL I THINK WOULD ALLOW FOR STANDARD ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT YES THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS BEING PROVIDED IN THE PROCESS HE'S ARE CONSISTENT. AND THAT'S BEEN AND SO I THINK THE PURPOSE THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BELL. MOVED THE BILL. SECOND. TO GIPSON YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE SERB DEPARTMENT IS. A MASTERS PROGRAM THIS IS THIS WILL COME ALONG ANY EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT EXIST I'M I THINK IT'S IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS ONE. UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ONE RICHARD OPPONENT ALSO EXERCISE THEIR VOTE. WE DON'T WANT TO DO VOTER SUPPRESSION THIS IS VOTER EDUCATION. OF THIS IS ALREADY WORKING RIGHT NOW AND CERTAINLY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AMID A FINE ORGANIZATION NOT FIT TO COME IN FOR SECURITY REASONS. THEN WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK FOR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA AND MEETS ACCEPTABILITY OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BUT AGAIN IT THIS IS I BELIEVE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND LOOKING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO GET TO MAINSTREAM THEM BACK INTO SOCIETY AND I BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BY PROVIDING. WITH THEM NOW TO THE VOTER EDUCATION BUT ALSO VOTER REGISTRATION TO LET THEM KNOW. ONE THEIR SITTERS POSSIBILITIES STILL THERE INTACT EXPRESSLY BICU DON'T HAVE ANY FELONIES YOU STILL ELIGIBLE TO VOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK BOARD AYE VOTE. AND THANK YOU AND JEFF RECOMMENDING I AND I ALSO. THINK AFTER YOU WERE EXPLAINING WHAT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DOES. I DON'T SPEAK FOR STATE SHERIFF BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A OF A PROCEDURE THAT MIGHT BE. AT LEAST A START OF OF GIVING DE UM LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME COMFORT LEVEL. ON ON HOW YOU IMPLEMENT THIS. OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FUNDING AND WE WE CAN GET THIS DONE. BUT ALSO I WANNA REMIND. THOSE OF US. THAT GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF GETTING ELECTED. DIDN'T OVER OVER AGAIN YOU NEED DIFFERENT GROUPS DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES TO GET PEOPLE NOW AND TO REGISTER. BUT ACTUALLY GET OUT THE VOTE IS IS A HERCULEAN TASK SOMETIMES THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS LAST ELECTION GALECTIN PERCENT. OF THE PEOPLE VOTING YOU HAD LIKE PRECINCTS IN THE ASSEMBLY WHERE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE VOTED ON A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND REGISTERED. WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND IN THE MORE HANDS ADDED THAT THE BETTER. AND I I WILL TELL YOU IF I DON'T. BELIEVE YOU'RE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. IN A C. P. BUT THERE MAY BE SOME GROUPS THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE DOWN. CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS WHEN THEY COME IN. VIA ESTABLISHMENT AND. THEN BEFORE THEY CAME AND SO. TO CHAIR SENSITIVE TO THAT AND I BELIEVE THE AUTHOR IS VERY SENSITIVE THAT. AND I THINK YOU ARE TOGETHER YOU CAN IRON OUT MOST OF WHAT YOU WANT. THE CHAIRS RECOMMEND AND I. Q.. AB THIRTY ONE FIFTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO BE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. CARILLO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. HIGHLY KNOW QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THERE'S DON'T CALL. THANK WAIT FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT. THANK YOU. I'M PATTERSON ARE AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE. I DON'T UNDER TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS. I'M PRESENTING TODAY. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE. WHICH WILL. RESOLVE SOME SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONS FROM LASH BE LAST YEAR'S S. B. FIFTY FOUR. THAT RESULTED IN SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES BEING LEFT OUT OF THE STATUTE THAT PERMITS COMMUNICATION. BASED ON A PERSON'S CRIMINAL HISTORY SECOND THE BILL BY THE WAY A A. B. THANK YOU A. B.. AT TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE. WILL ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO COOPERATE. WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES IF. AN INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN CONVICTED. CERTAIN SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES. LIKE ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER. DOMESTIC. BATTERY. THE ANIMAL CRUELTY AND KNOWINGLY VIOLATING PROTECTIVE ORDERS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN SOMEONE IN THEIR CUSTODY MEETS ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHEN OFFICERS ARE OR ARE NOT AUTHORIZED. TO COOPERATE WITH IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. AS IT STANDS TODAY SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES WERE LEFT OUT OF THAT STATUTE. THAT PERMITS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AGENCIES BASED ON A PERSON'S. CRIMINAL HISTORY. ESTABLISHING THE FULL HISTORY OF A PERSON'S CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. TO DETERMINE IF LOCAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY COMMUNICATE AND COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAS BECOME AN AREA OF CONFUSION. AND A. B. TWO NINE THREE ONE. ATTEMPTS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BY CLARIFYING WHEN THIS COMMUNICATION MAY OCCUR. S. B. FIFTY FOUR HAS IMPEDED COMMUNICATION COOPERATION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. EVEN IN CASES WHEN SUCH COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION. A BECAUSE OF THE CRIMINAL HISTORY ARE CRUCIAL TO THE SAFETY OF OUR OFFICERS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND IN FACT THE CRIMINAL SUSPECTS THEMSELVES. IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES ARE NOT GOING TO AND THEIR ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO ARE HERE ILLEGALLY SB FIFTY FOUR CANNOT CHANGE THAT. BUT THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS WHETHER WE WOULD HAVE THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHEN THEY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE COMMITTED SERIOUS OR VIOLENT CRIMES. APPREHENDED IN PROCESSED IN A SECURED JAIL FACILITY. OR OUT ON THE STREETS WHERE VIOLENCE MAY HAPPEN. AND THIS REALLY MEANS THAT THE INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE SAFE LOCALE. AVE SECURE JAIL FACILITY. THESE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS ARE BEING FORCED INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND IN TWO. ABOUT CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THOSE WHO. HAVE COMMITTED THESE CRIMINAL ACTS. DON'T WANT TO BE. CAUGHT. AND THEY WILL BE ON THE RUN AND THEY MAY VERY WELL BE AND CIRCUMSTANCES AS WE HAVE SEEN WHICH CREATES A. REAL SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE OUT NEIGHBORHOODS THEMSELVES. A AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. AND ALLOW OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO FULFILL. THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN THE SAFE SECURED ENVIRONMENT OF A JAIL FACILITY. IN WHICH WE HAVE KNOWN. A CRIMINALS HERE ILLEGALLY WHO HAVE COMMITTED. THESE VERY SPECIFIC CRIMES. SO HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS COREY SALCEDO WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. BUT I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORSO'S OVER HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THIS BILL. BUT LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING THAT SHERIFF'S AND FROM MY LAW ENFORCEMENT DO NOT ENGAGE IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE THAT POINT CLEAR DURING THE PENDENCY OF S. B. FIFTY FOUR. WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF THE RESOURCES TO DO IT THERE'S NOT A WILL TO ENGAGE IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. SO THE NOTION THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. PLUCKS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PLUGS PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES ARE PLACES OF WORK. BASED ON IMMIGRATION VIOLATIONS JUST ISN'T THE FACT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MEASURED AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THAT WILL JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. AS WE KNOW IN ARE OPPOSITION TO SB FIFTY FOUR THE LIST OF CRIMES. THAT ALLOWS US TO COMMUNICATE HAS SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONS WE THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT PERSONS IN OUR JAILS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES LIKE ASSAULTING A PEACE OFFICER DOMESTIC BATTERY. ANIMAL CRUELTY JUST TO NAME A FEW. WILL ALSO THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM KNOWN MS THIRTEEN GANG MEMBERS WHO ARRESTED FOR WEAPONS CHARGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY SB FIFTY FOUR PRECLUDES THAT TYPE OF COMMUNICATION AGAIN. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOLDING ANYBODY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LENGTH IN THE PERIOD OF TIME WE CAN HOLD SOMEBODY. WE DO NOT HONOR DETAINEES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ASK US TO HOLD A PERSON PASSED WHEN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NORMALLY BE LAWFULLY RELEASE. BUT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS SOME. I THINK NOTION THAT THERE ARE OFFENSES THAT WERE OMITTED FROM S. B. FIFTY FOUR THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT. THIS BILL MERELY ADDS SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES THAT WERE OMITTED. IT ATTEMPTS TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME HELP WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTIFYING THE PEOPLE IN JAILS WHO HAVE THE REQUISITE CRIMINAL HISTORY. OR ARREST. WE WANT TO BE SURE WE COMMUNICATE ABOUT DANGEROUS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR JAILS IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR JAILS. WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SPECIFIC CRIMES OR WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES? ARE WE DON'T WANT TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE ABOUT RESPECT THE LAW FOLLOW S. B. FIFTY FOUR. ARE BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED TO. GIVE US SOME HELP WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE WE DON'T UNDER OR OVER COMMUNICATE WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. WE THINK THIS IS A MODEST EFFORT BASED ON SOUND POLICY. THE KEEPS S. B. FIFTY FOUR LARGELY INTACT WHILE ADDRESSING THE I'D THE DEFICIENCIES WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND HOPE THAT THERE IS SOME MIDDLE GROUND THAT. GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THIS COMMITTEE ROUTINELY. LOOKS AT BILLS AND AND SAYS HEY WE KNOW WE MAY NOT BE THERE YET BUT LET'S LET'S TRY TO MOVE FORWARD ON SOMETHING WHERE FOLKS WE THINK WE CAN AGREE. I THINK THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY WE'RE LOOKING FOR TODAY IS TO IS TO HAVE SOME. CONSIDERATION OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE IN THAT AGAIN WE'RE NOT SEEKING OUT RIGHT REPEAL BUT BUT LOOKING TO MODESTLY ADDRESS IDENTIFIED CONCERNS AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT'S MORE ABOUT GOD MISTER CHAIR RIGHT CHEN WITH RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT WE HAVE NO INTEREST AT ALL IN BEING. INVOLVED IN IMMIGRATION. ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HOWEVER WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THESE CRIMES THAT WERE OMITTED. INVERT LEE FROM S. B. FIFTY FOUR WE LOOK AT THIS IS IT'S KIND OF A SIMPLE CLEAN UP BILL AND WE HEARD YOUR SUPPORT THINKING. ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. MY INGRAM LEGISLATIVE ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY HERO POSE AB TWENTY NINE. THIRTY ONE BECAUSE IT EXPANDS THE QUALIFYING CONVICTIONS AND SETS UP A PROCESS FOR DOJ TO COMMUNICATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THE. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CAME TOGETHER LAST YEAR DOING ACT SB FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE THE CONTINUED ENTANGLEMENT OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WAS UNDERMINING PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHERE FEEL FOR ALL OF REPORTING CRIMES AS DOCUMENTED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING THE DROP. IN LATINO COMMUNITIES REPORTING CRIMES AS A RESULT OF THIS ENTANGLEMENT. THERE WAS A ROBUST PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE QUALIFYING CONVICTIONS SUCH BE INCLUDED IN S. B. FIFTY FOUR THERE IS. IN TENS PUBLIC DEBATE ABOUT IT AND ROBUST DIALOGUE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BY ADDING THESE NEW QUALIFYING CONVICTIONS THIS BILL UNDERMINES THE CAREFUL BALANCE THAT WAS STRUCK WITH THAT BILL LAST YEAR. WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A RATIONALE FOR REQUIRING THE DOJ TO EXPEND RESOURCES. TO CREATE THE SYSTEM TO NOTIFY AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MAY BOOK SOME OF QUALIFYING CONVICTIONS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CRIMINAL HISTORY WHEN THAT BOOK AND FINGERPRINT SOMEONE. THEY ALSO THINK INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE COOPERATION AUTHORIZES COMPLETELY DISCRETIONARY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THINK YOU. THINK. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER GALIANO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MIGRANT POLICY CENTER. PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO LOS ANGELES RESIDENT WHOSE NAME I WILL NOT BE SHARING FOR REASONS RELATED TO PRIVACY CONCERNS CALL NINE ONE ONE FREE HELP DURING A DOMESTIC DISPUTE. WHEN POLICE ARRIVED THEY DEMANDED SHE SPEAKING ENGLISH AND ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD A GREEN CARD. THEY ARRESTED HER RATHER THAN HER ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD BRUISES ON HER BODY DEMONSTRATING SHE HAD BEEN ATTACKED FEELING OVERWHELMED SHE FAINTED. AND AT THE TIME OF ARREST AT THE HOSPITAL A DOCTOR EXAMINED HER FOUND BRUISES AND RELEASED HER WITH PAPERWORK SAYING SHE WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM. BUT POLICE TOOK HER INTO CUSTODY ANYWAY WHEN SHE WAS BOOKED HER FINGERPRINTS TRIGGERED AN ICE HOLE. WHICH STORIES LIKE THESE IT IS NOT A SURPRISE THAT AT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO CALL POLICE IF THEY WERE VICTIMS OF A CRIME. THESE AND SIMILAR EXPERIENCES I'D NEEDLESSLY DAMAGED THE TRUST THAT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PLACE IMPERIL THE SAFETY OF COMMUNITY AT THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AGREE THEY DON'T WANT TO SERVE AS IMMIGRATION AGENTS YET OPENING THE DOOR OF ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN POLICE AND SHERIFFS IN THE DEPORTATION PROCESS AS THIS BILL. TRIES TO FURTHER DO PUTS ARE IN JEOPARDY A CRIME SURVIVORS WITNESSES AND OTHERS AT RISK AND FURTHER UNDERMINES COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE AND WASTE LIMITED STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES. I THE REALIZE TRUST ACTING CALIFORNIA VALLEY'S ACT ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS IN BUILDING TRUST AND COMMUNITIES AB TWO NINE THREE ONE SEVERELY UNDERMINES THESE TOOLS AND PUTS OUR COMMUNITY SAFETY AT RISK. I JUST FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES. AND GIVEN ENOUGH ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIANS JOHN OPPOSITION. PAUL FOCUS IF JUSTICE COALITION FROM THE OPPOSING. ROSE CON IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER WE OPPOSE HIM ALSO APPEARING ON BEHALF OF TRAILER WHO ALSO OPPOSES. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. YOU. ANY. QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MICHAEL. WELL FIRST OF ALL. THE THE IDEA THAT THIS BODY. UP PRODUCES COMPLETE AND PERFECT LEGISLATION TIME AND TIME OUT. IS EVIDENCE THAT. TO BE FAULTY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THERE ARE FIX IT BILLS AND THAT THERE ARE. CLEAN UP BILLS THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE. BUT THESE ARE CRIMES WERE. OF. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED BECAUSE THEY. ROSE TO THE LEVEL OF CONCERNS THAT WOULD WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK IS PATENTLY WRONG. IF THAT WERE THE CASE THAT WOULD BE A WHOLE SERIES OF. OF OF OCT. CRIMES INSIDE FIFTY FOUR THAT OUGHT TO BE REMOVED BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ANIMAL CRUELTY. THINGS OF THIS NATURE AND I THINK THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THAT DEPICTED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WERE BROUGHT. CLEARLY INDICATED WHAT THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO AND WHAT IT IS IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO DO. AND SO I'M ASKING CONSIDERATION. AND AYE VOTE HERE FOR THE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS REASONS THAT THERE WERE UNINTENTIONAL OMISSIONS THAT SHOULD BE BUILT BACK. BUT INTO SB FIFTY FOUR WE DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH OTHER BILLS. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SUGGEST THAT EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS PERFECT THAT. AFTER IT BECOMES LAW WE FIXED THESE KINDS OF OVERSIGHTS. REPEATEDLY. AND ARE ALSO ONE THAT. THAT AGAIN REITERATED THIS THIS COMES FROM BEING A. EIGHT YEARS MAYOR OF THE CITY OF FRESNO APPEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE LONGTIME RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND FRESNO. THE DISRUPTION IN THE ABILITY. FOR THE IMMIGRATION A ENFORCEMENT. TO. GO TO THE JAIL AND TO PROCESS AND TO DEAL WITH THESE WHO HAVE. COMMITTED THESE KINDS OF CRIMES. LITERALLY FORCES THE IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE TO GO OUT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND DO THE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT RESEMBLE AND LOOK LIKE RATES WE HAVE HAD. LOTS OF OTHER EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN. OUT. ICE IS GONE AFTER THEM. THEY HAVE. BRIAN. A VIOLENCE HAD BEEN HAS ENSUED. HIGH SPEED CHASES HAVE BEEN SUED. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO BE SAFE FOR EVERYBODY? THOSE WHO HAVE. THE CONVICTION. THOSE WHO ARE PRESENTLY AT THE JAIL AND SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY. A PROCESSED IN THE JAIL ENVIRONMENT SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE RISK TO SAFETY HEALTH. IT IN THE COMMUNITIES OUT AS A RESULT. THESE ARE A CO EQUAL IN VALUE TO THE OTHER. A VIOLENT CRIMES THAT WERE. IT IN INCLUDED IN. AB FIFTY FOR SO FOR THESE REASONS. WERE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THIS DOES NOT DAMAGE OR DESTROY FIFTY FOUR AS AS IS BEING SUGGESTED. IT DOES ADD A FEW MORE BETTER OBVIOUSLY VIOLENT. AND. SETUP. THEY'VE MUCH MORE SAFE AND AND. POPE PROCESSING OF ALL OF THIS. ARE IN ORG ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH. EVERYONE IS SAFE. TO DO OTHERWISE IS REALLY PUTTING A LOT OF PEOPLE AT RISK IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO THESE HIGH SPEED CHASES INTO THE REACTION. THAT SOME WOULD HAVE WITH WITH BEING. OF. BUT. IT HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH IMMIGRATION AND AND AND HAVE SOME ISA. WHAT INTO THE? APPREHENDED. AT AGAIN IT DOESN'T NOTHING. A. TO UNDO FIFTY FOUR. I'M SURPRISED THAT. THE OTHERS DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE. VIOLENT ACTS THAT FIT WELL WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS THAT WERE IN. FIFTY FOUR AS WELL SO I THINK. TO SAY NOTED THIS BILL IS TO BASICALLY SAY NO TO. TO WHAT TO A SELECTIVE. NOTION THAT. WE GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND THAT THESE. CRIMINAL ACTS A RELATIVELY MEANINGLESS I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MEANINGLESS WHATSOEVER. FOR THOSE REASON I'M ASKING FOR A AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON FOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND LET ME. MAYBE QUICKLY TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT DION. CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS WERE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER DO WISH. THERE WAS A BILL ON DNA AND DNA TESTING AND RIGHT NOW WE DO IT FOR FELONIES. AND SOMEONE CAME A MEMBER CAME TO. OPEN IT UP DNA FOR EVERYONE. INCLUDING SOME OF THE. OFFENSES THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR BILL. ON THIS COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY LOOKED AT SERIOUS MISDEMEANORS. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE SERIOUS MISDEMEANORS TERRIFIC DIRECT CORRELATION THAT THEIR NEXT STEP WOULD BE A FELONY. AND THIS COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED PUTTING THOSE. AND THERE UNFORTUNATELY THE AUTHOR DID NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE SUGGESTIONS AND THE BUILDING MOVE FORWARD. AND SO. BUT PETTY THEFT. JUMPING FROM SHOPLIFTING TO BUT. THIS IS. SERIOUS. VIOLENT CRIME THAT AND THAT THAT WILL THE FLOW MUCH. DRUNK DRIVING YES YOU COULD YOU COULD INJURE SOMEONE BUT. DRUNK DRIVING ISN'T AND A SERIES OF VIOLENT. BUT STRANGULATION MURDER. I WOULD EVEN CONSIDER. LOOKING AT OUR ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER AS SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD. LOOK AT AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY WORKED WITH YOU ON ON THAT OR EVEN THE CHEMICAL AGENT PART OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S. THAT COULD BE VERY SERIOUS BUT AS IT IS WRITTEN NOW ON I HAVE TO RECOMMEND NO. AND AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW. WE DO BOMB. I USE OR COMPROMISE WE DO TRY TO FIND. AREAS WHERE IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE OF WHY YOU WANT TO DO THAT ALL THE THINGS YOU LISTED IN HERE. DON'T. I DON'T MAKE SENSE AND ACTUALLY. ARE AGAINST WHAT. SB FIFTY FOUR BUT ABOUT AND IN FACT IT THINK IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR. IMMIGRANTS AND OTHERS SIMON HAD THE BILL. THAT IF YOU BROUGHT A CRIME. TO. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE YOU IMMIGRATION STATUS. QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY AND STUFF LIKE HOPEFULLY SUCH SEE TRENDING UP OF IMMIGRANTS REPORTING CRIMES NOW AGAINST THEM BUT OTHERS. SO THERE'S THERE'S JUST BALLOTS WE NEED TO GET TO AND I AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A BALANCE WE NEED TO GET TO. BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE ITEMS THAT YOU NAMED. DON'T GET US THERE SO UNFORTUNATE CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND A NO VOTE. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY I GOT REAL. CAMBIADO GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY. QUIRK. QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. THE MEASURES DON'T CALL. NOW MR STONE. OBSERVERS TO STONE WITH FIRST ANY NEEDS. THE NAME OF AT THE TOP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. MEMBERS EVERY INMATE AT CDC ARE HAS AN INMATE TRUST ACCOUNT AND CURRENTLY THE WAY THE LAWS ARE WRITTEN IS THEY ARE CONSIDERED INDIGENT IF THEY HAVE LESS THAN A DOLLAR. IN THAT ACCOUNT FOR THIRTY DAY PERIOD. ONCE THEY BECOME INDIGENT UNDER THAT DEFINITION THEY HAVE ACCESS TO. SUNDRIES TOILETRIES BASIC SUPPLIES THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND ALL IS WELL AS POSTAGE OTHER WAYS OF COMMUNICATING OUTSIDE BOTH THE COURTS TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND TO OTHERS WHAT THIS BILL DOES WOULD DO WOULD RAISE. THAT ONE DOLLAR TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS SO THAT IF AN INMATE HAS. LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN THEIR ACCOUNT FOR PERIOD OF THIRTY DAYS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE DECLARED INDIGENT AND HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE BENEFITS WITHIN CDC ARE. THIS IS. UPDATING WHAT'S BEEN ARE A LONG STANDING POLICY AND IT'S PART OF GIVING INMATES ACCESS TO RESOURCES WHILE THEY'RE ON THE INSIDE AND HOPEFULLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. THINK OF THE BILL SECOND. WE HAVE WITNESSES YUP WITNESSES. I'M. MORNING CHAIR MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEAR JOE WILSON. I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS COSPONSORED AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THREE THE DIGNITY AND CARE ACT AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE. I WAS INCARCERATED MY SELF IN THE CDC OUR SYSTEM FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE. I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF CCW FEEL THE LAST DECADE. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS FROM WHAT WE LEARNED FROM VISITING SEVERAL HUNDRED WOMEN AND TRANSGENDER PRISONERS IN THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S PRISON EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS? IS THAT LIFE AS A PRISONER IS A DEEPLY DEHUMANIZING EXPERIENCE. RAISING THE INDIGENT SEE THRESHOLD FROM ONE DOLLAR TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS INSURES THAT PEOPLE WITH MINIMAL FUNDS CAN ACCESS MEDICAL CARE DENTAL CARE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE HYGIENE SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS FOR ACCESSING THE COURTS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE SHAME AND DEPRIVATION THAT MANY PEOPLE FEEL FOR RELYING ON OUTSIDE SUPPORT. ON OR HAVING TO FOREGO BASIC NEEDS ALL TOGETHER. BY RAISING THE THRESHOLD OF IMAGES FROM ONE DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TWENTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WILL NO LONGER. HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES LIKE. I HAVE FIVE DOLLARS ON MY BOOKS. WHICH MAKES ME TOO RICH. TO QUALIFY FOR ENERGY SUPPLIES. OF BASIC HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND LOOKS AND STAMPS. SO DO I WRITE MY CHILDREN. OR DONE BY A BAR OF SOAP TO KEEP CLEAN WITH. OR DO I KEEP THAT FIVE DOLLARS. AVAILABLE IN CASE I NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR AND PAY A FIVE DOLLAR COPAY. THE INCREASE IN THE INDIGENTS THRESHOLD ALLOWS REASONABLE AND FAIR AMOUNT OF BREATHING ROOM. FOR THE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD AFFECT. TO MANAGE ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT BURNING FAMILIES ARE HEADED FOR WILL BASIC NEEDS ALTOGETHER. WE RECEIVED THIS LETTER IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY THREE FROM A WOMAN AT CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION. FOR WOMEN. IT'S BILLS OUT THE REALITY ONE LESS THAN IN TO CHET AND YOU CAN'T BUY ANYTHING WITH A DOLLAR INSIDE OR OUTSIDE. SO I'M JUST GOING TO READ JUST A COUPLE OF STATEMENTS FROM FOLKS. INSIDE OF THEM. REALLY INTERESTING THAT SHE WRITES AT THIS ONE DOLLAR LESS RESULTS IN POTENTIAL VIOLENCE. AND DAMAGE TO WOMEN'S SELF ESTEEM BECAUSE YOUR TEASE THE TO SMELL SO TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ALSO FACE INSIDE IS. THE FACT THAT THE MATERIALS VOTE THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE GIVEN TO CHOOSE FROM MORE OFTEN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE NOT QUALITY PRODUCTS. SO FOR SOME OF THE WOMEN IN THE ROOM YOU GUYS CAN PROBABLY RELATE TO USING A KOTEX OR TAMPON THAT'S THAT'S REALLY NOT ANY GOOD FOR YOU AND THEN YOU'D YOU'VE GOT. PIECES OF IT COMING OUT OF YOU ALONG WITH BLOOD CLOTS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY ANY CALL PRODUCTS SO THIS IS OUTSIDE. INSIDE IT'S WORSE IT REALLY IS WORSE I'M NOT A FORMALLY INCARCERATED PERSON THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN THE PRESENTS FOR TEN YEARS WOMEN SPECIFICALLY. AND ALL OF THIS IS JUST REALLY NOT OKAY WE EXPECT THESE PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND HAVE SOME KIND OF SENSE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WHERE. THEY'VE HAD TO FIGHT OR OTHERWISE JOCKEY AROUND FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A BAR SOAP OR TOOTHPASTE OR A RECALL THAT YOUR CREAM. ARM AND I AM GONNA IF IT'S OKAY TO WRITE HER UP A COUPLE SECONDS OKAY. I THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE INSIDE AS SHE WRITES INMATES. WORKING FOR EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. I NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO BUY FLOUR DOLLAR IN MY TRUST MAKES ME TOO RICH INDIGENT KIT IS OUT OF MY REACH. GET TO BUY MY OWN TOOTHBRUSH A WHERE MOST PRISONS HAVE TO PAY ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT. OF WHATEVER THEY MAKING RESTITUTION AND IF YOUR IF YOUR INCOME IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS A MONTH OR LESS. AND WE'RE ASKING THAT IT BE NO LESS. AND I. YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU EXPECT. KEEPING THE LOCKER INTO BEER ENCOURAGES EVERYONE TO DO SOME KIND OF HUSTLE. REGARDLESS IF IT ENDS IN SOME TYPE OF TUSSLE SHE WRITES TUSSLE WE KNOW THERE'S VIOLENCE IN THE PRISONS AND SO I WOULD JUST SAY TO BE RESPONSIBLE. THANK YOU TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS NOT A LOT OF MONEY. THANK YOU THAT EARLIER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARGOT ADLER PRICES TO GO UP. YEAH. I'M MARGO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THINK YOU VERY MUCH. AT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK. GERMAN INFLATION ADJUSTER ON THIS. NO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO OTHERWISE KILL SOMEBODY ELSE'S GOING TO COME IN AND TEN YEARS IN WANNA. MAKE IT FIFTY DOLLARS WHATEVER. SO I I JUST SUGGEST YOU ADD THAT. THE OTHER THING IS THIS ISN'T AWFUL SYSTEM. I SUPPOSE THERE'S THERE'S SOME REASON THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY AROUND SO BUT. MAYBE THERE WERE. WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE EATING IT I DON'T HOW. THIS JUST SOUNDS AWFUL ARMED GUARDS PRISON IS BUT. YOU KNOW. THAT THE BASICS ARE NOT PROVIDED TO YOU. YOU WOULD THINK FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE PERSON COULD GET AT LEAST. ONE BAR OF SOAP A MONTH GIVEN HOW LITTLE THEY EARN. AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TWO OF US COULD WORK ON NEXT YEAR. I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT THINGS LIKE. TOOTHBRUSHES. SO AT CETERA HAVE TO BE PURCHASED. YOU KNOW. I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE. SOME SORT OF. A MONTHLY ALLOWANCE FOR. THINGS LIKE SOAP AND. TOOTHBRUSHES ETCETERA THANK YOU. THEY'RE NOT IN IRAQ QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY CLOSE WITH SYSTEM THANK YOU ED AND I COMPLETELY AGREE IF YOU'RE A WEALTHY IN MAY WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE A DOLLAR OR MORE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. THEN YOU ARE IN FACT RESPONSIBLE TO BUY YOUR OWN SUNDRIES. IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN. YOU GET IT FROM THE STATE. AND YOU HAVE TO REQUEST FOR YOU HAVE TO REQUESTED. YEAH IT'S A CHALLENGE WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE CDC ARE ON THIS WILL CERTAINLY TALK I'M VERY INTERESTED IN AN ESCALATOR OR SEEING IF THERE'S A MORE HUMANE WAY. TO GO ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY FOR THE ACCESS TO THIS REPRESENTS THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT REPRESENTS AND HYGIENE. THAT IT REPRESENTS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT IN MY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARCHERS RECOMMEND AYE VOTE CALL THE ROLL.

OF ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO THAT IS BEING ABLE TO GET A LICENSE TO GET A JOB. AND BE ABLE TO THEM PAYOFF FINE SO THIS BILL NARROWLY FOCUS IS TO BE ABLE TO SAY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A LICENSE.

AB TWENTY FOURTEEN IS A BILL THAT THAT WE'VE. TITLE JUSTICE FOR AVERY GLOVER. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BRING JUSTICE TO ASSESS THE ACT OF VIOLENCE AND PROVIDE CLOSURE FOR A FAMILY. HAD THEIR YOUNG SON TAKEN AWAY. FROM THE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD AMY EVERITT LOVER INTO PROPOUNDING WAS KILLED. IN THE FATAL HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT. IN THE CITY OF EL CENTRO. PERPETRATOR RESORTED TO EXTREME MEASURES TO COVER UP THE CRIME NOT ONLY DID THE CORPORATE FLEE THE SCENE AND HIDE THEIR CAR IN THE. COUNTRYSIDE OF THE COUNTY FOR OVER A WEEK BUT FALSE STATEMENTS WERE GIVEN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS DURING THE INVESTIGATION. PACIFIC IS SUSPECT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION HAD BEEN SOLD. THE MORNING PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT ACCORDING TO CHP. INVOLVED IN THE CASE OF BROKEN PIECE OF HEADLIGHT LEFT BEHIND THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FIX WITH THE SERIAL NUMBER. ALLOWED CHP INVESTIGATORS IDENTIFY. THE MAKE AND THE MODEL OF THE VEHICLE INVOLVED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT. WAS NOT UNTIL A NEIGHBOR CONTACTED ALL CENTRAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TRYING TO. FIND THE VEHICLE TO HIS NEIGHBOR THAT THE SUSPECT WAS ARRESTED. NOT FOR THE BROKEN PIECE OF HAD LIKE LEFT BEHIND THE GUILTY PARTY MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN. CONNECTED TO THIS CRIME. DESPITE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE OFFENDER RECEIVED THE MIDDLE PRISON TERM. OF THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF A MAXIMUM OF FOUR YEAR SENTENCE. FAMILY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO CARRY ON IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS TRAGEDY. I WOULD PERSONALLY LIKE TO THANK THE BLACK LIVES MATTER. CHAPTER OF IMPROVE COUNTY FOR THEIR HELP AND SUPPORT DURING THIS ORDEAL TO THE FAMILY IN THE COMMUNITY. CHAIR AND MEMBERS I INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WILL LEAD TO A GREATER REDUCTION AND IT RUNS. INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE AFTER TALKING WITH AVERY GLOVER'S MOTHER AFTER SEEN. THE PAIN SHE CARRIED THREE YEARS AFTER THE ACCIDENT AFTER HEARING ABOUT ALL OF THE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT THE PERPETRATOR WENT THROUGH TO ESCAPE JUSTICE MY THOUGHTS TURN TO MY OWN CHILDREN. EVERY PARENT KNOWS HOW PRECIOUS OUR CHILDREN ARE. HOW? IRREPLACEABLE THEIR LIVES ARE AND THOUGH NO LAW CAN BRING A CHILD THAT'S GONE BACK TO LIFE. THESE TYPES OF CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECKLESSNESS. THE RECKLESSNESS AND SELFISHNESS OF THE PERPETRATOR KILLED EVERY GLOVER AND HE WAS ALMOST ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE IN TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT FOR FLEEING THE SCENE OF A VEHICULAR ACCIDENT. THAT RESULTS IN DEATH OR SERIOUS PERMANENT INJURY. TWO FOUR OR SIX YEARS THE BELT INCREASES START TO HOLDING THESE INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE RECKLESSNESS PENALIZE THEM FOR TRYING TO EVADE JUSTICE AND HOPEFULLY SPARE OTHER MOTHERS FROM THIS TORMENT. WITH ME I HAVE A. WITNESS THE. THAT IS ACTUALLY. TESTIFY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND DONE. SHE'S HERE TODAY AT MRS GIPSON. I WHO WILL TESTIFY ON THIS BILLS WELL. THANK YOU. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS MY NAME IS A CRUCIAL GIPSON. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR MINUTES I PRETEND TO SPEAK BEFORE YOUR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOURTEEN. WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE THE TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE CONVICTED OF A HIT AND RUN CRIME. MANY OF YOU. KNOW THAT MY HUSBAND IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON BUT MANY DO NOT KNOW. THAT I AM A MOTHER OF TWO BOYS ONE WHICH WAS TRAGICALLY HIT AND KILLED BY A HIT AND RUN DRIVER RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES IN FRONT OF MY HOME. ON MARCH TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE I HAVE TO DIFFICULT DAY OF MY LIFE I HAD TO BURY MY THREE YEAR OLD SON AS RESULT OF A HIT AND RUN. YOU SEE WAS ON THE EVENING OF MARCH EIGHTEENTH WHEN MY SON. WAS STRUCK BY A VEHICLE BY A WOMAN. SHE GOT HER VEHICLE AFTER THE IMPACT HE WENT TO THE AREA WHERE MY SON LIVES IN THIS STREET LIKE BLISS FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS. JUMP BACK IN HER VEHICLE AND SHE TOOK OFF. THIS PERSON NEVER CAME FOR TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR ACTIONS FOR KILLING MY SON. MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME I HAVE A BOY THAT CANNOT BE FIELD. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO MY FAMILY MY FRIENDS MY SUPPORT GROUPS JUSTICE FOR MYRNA CHILDREN. PARENTS OF MURDERED CHILDREN. BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER FOR THEM. I'M REALLY NOT SURE BOBBY BEFORE YOUR TODAY. THIS BILL OF STAYS THE CURRENT LAWS AND CHANGE THE TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT FROM TWO THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND INCREASES IT TO TWO FOUR OR SIX YEARS. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO MARK YOU WANT US TO EVEN BEGIN TO TOUCH ON THE HEARTBREAK OF LOSING A CHILD. BUT WHEN A PERSON TAKE A LIFE BY HIDDEN RUN. LOOK AT THEM AND TAKE OFFICE IT'S AMAZING TO ME HOW THE GO WILD DATA DAY IN THIS LIFE. THE YEARS ADDED TO THIS BILL CANNOT ERASE THE YEARS OF HEARTBREAK THAT HAS BROUGHT ME MY FAMILY BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURING JUSTICE WHICH I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE. CAN BE DONE WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ACTS WERE YOU AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOURTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MRS GIPSON THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. ARE A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SHOP WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. COR SAYS IT WILL BE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALERT. ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION I'M MARGOT GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO SAY FIRST THAT MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. ON. BUT THIS BILL IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY. ON VEHICLE CODE SECTION TWENTY THOUSAND AND ONE. WHICH IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS HIDDEN RUN. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EVEN HAVE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT TO BE PROSECUTED UNDER THE SECTION IT'S MERELY FLEEING THE SCENE OF THE. ACCIDENT. AND. THERE ARE COUNTLESS REASONS WHY IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE NOW. TO. CHANGE THE TREND IN CALIFORNIA TO RE EXAMINE. HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAVE INCARCERATED? I. MASS INCARCERATION HAS NOT MADE OUR CITIES AND STATES COMMUNITIES SAFER. IT HAS ONLY BURDEN THE TAXPAYERS. AND OUR SCARCE RESOURCES NEED TO BE USED FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. IT'LL WITNESSES. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS. MY SYMPATHY AND I. I CAN'T IMAGINE. I WISH THERE WERE A CHANGE TO THE LAW THAT THAT WOULD KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE AND SPARE OTHER FAMILIES THAT THAT KIND. OF SUFFERING BUT BUT THIS BILL WON'T DO THAT. AND I JOIN IN THE THE COMMENTS OF OF. MISS GEORGE I INCREASING THE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT FOR LEAVING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. WILL DO NOTHING TO DETER FURTHER INCIDENTS OF RECKLESS DRIVING OR EVEN TO DETER DRIVERS FROM LEAVING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT ON THERE ARE BETTER USES FOR THE STATE'S RESOURCES THAT WILL BETTER INCREASE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. ALRIGHT ANY. OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. ANNOUNCER HERNANDEZ MAY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TREES ARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. OPPOSED TO BILL FOR THE REASON STATE OUR LETTER. THANK YOU. OUR EARLY. MILIC COMMITTEE BILL GREG QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE YOU MAY CLOSE. WELL IT WAS SHARED AND. COLLEAGUES AND OF COURSE OF THOSE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED BOTH AND SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I THINK THIS IS A MEASURE THAT RAISES THE BAR ON. THE ACCOUNTABILITY. OF INACTION. THAT RESULTS IN THE FATAL. HOW COME OF OF AN INDIVIDUAL? I ALONG WITH MANY OF YOU HERE. WELL SAW PROCLAIM. YOU KNOW. OF BEING A ADVOCATE. FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUES. FOR. THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF US YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO LIVE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REALLY LIMIT THEIR ABILITIES TO? OUT BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND I FOR ONE YOU KNOW I BELIEVE ALSO THAT IT ISN'T ABOUT. INCARCERATING PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO TURN AROUND THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT. I I I CITY YOU CHAIR IN AND COLLEAGUES IN AND THOSE WHO ARE HERE. I'M HOW DO YOU LOOK AT. SOMEONE IN THE EYES. MOTHER OF FATHER WHO HAS LOST THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER IN THESE TYPES OF TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES. AND YET. YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY. IN THE CASE OF MRS GIPSON NO ONE'S EVER BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE CASE OF MISTER GLOVER THIS YOUNG MAN. WHO WAS TAKEN AWAY? TRAGICALLY. THIS INDIVIDUAL. DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO EVADE. BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE AND SO. FOR ME IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE WITHOUT A DOUBT. AND ALSO. A COMFORTING FOR A FAMILY KNOWING THAT YEAH. THE CHILD WILL NEVER. BE BACK WITH US BUT THE FACT IS THAT SOMEONE WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTION AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO ITS ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. ANYONE. WHO FLEES FROM A ACCIDENTALLY HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT AND THE OUTCOME IS FATAL I MEAN I CAN IMAGINE? THE CONSCIENCE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GIVEN AWAY. KNOWING OR NOT KNOWING THAT THEY'VE. HARM SOMEONE. AND THAT. IN. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REMORSE FOR THAT TYPE OF ACTION YOU KNOW. A TWO YEAR PRISON IMPRISONMENT FOR THAT TYPE OF SITUATION IS. NOT JUSTICE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT SO I RESPECTFULLY. IN A REQUEST THAT WE WORK WITH YOU AND AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND FOLKS WERE. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS AND PERHAPS. THE SENSE HERE IS THAT. YET THIS WILL DETER. THESE TYPES OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WELL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND I THINK. THAT. FOR FAMILIES I THINK WOULD BE JUSTICE IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO. THIS MATTER. AND AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW. WANT ONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. DOING TESTIMONY ONLY BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY AND IT'S COMMITTEE REALLY WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU ON A SOLUTION. IT IS DIFFICULT. LISTENING TO THE STORIES. IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT ONE INCH WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUES ONCE YOUR FRATERNITY BROTHER. WHO TELLS YOU ABOUT? THEIR CHILD. SOMEONE YOU ACTUALLY KNOW. AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO LISTEN TO THE STORIES. AND ON MRS GIPSON YOUR VERY ELOQUENT. AND STATING. THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AND SO I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT NOT ONLY AS A AFTER AMERICAN. A FATHER AND I KNOW MR. GARCIA IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN HIS COMMUNITIES QUESTION AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND DOES HE HAS BEEN. A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR THIS. BUT THIS PROBLEM ON AND IS IT THERE'S PROBABLY TWO OR THREE AREAS I THINK. WE MIGHT BE ABLE. BRING. BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE SO THAT. WE CAN HOPEFULLY CURTAIL PEOPLE FROM FLEEING. BUT ARE LEAST MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT AND I WANT TO HAVE THAT. CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. I DIDN'T WANNA. DO IT HERE AND AND AND THE OPEN PUBLIC BUT I GUARANTEE YOU AS CHAIR OF FORMER CHAIR THE BLACK CAUCUS FORMER CHAIR. OF AN AND CHAIR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. WERE GAUCHE. WORKAWAY HOPEFULLY TO A SOLUTION AND SOMEONE A THANK YOU ON FREE COMMITMENT THING TO GIPSON FAMILY FROM SHARING MATCHES. AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO TO SHARE. A PAIN. THAT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. AND SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TAX. THANK YOU. ADMINISTERED. CHIU. FOR DOCTOR WEBER. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. I HOPE.

ON THAT REPORT INCLUDES THE NATURE OF THE BIAS AND HEARING IN EACH PARTICULAR CRIME. VICTIM CHARACTERISTICS. OFFENSE TYPE AND LOCATION JUST TO NAME A FEW DATA POINTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THAT REPORT THAT IS ALREADY. PRODUCED UNDER EXISTING LAW. THIS BILL AS A NEW STEP BUT IT'S UNCLEAR AND WHAT RELEVANT INFO IT PROVIDES OR FACILITATES. IT'S FRANKLY UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT APPEARS UNLIKELY TO REMEDY ANY ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED PROBLEM IT'S A CHECK BOX ON THE FRONT A REPORT. FOR REPORT THAT OSTENSIBLY WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY SORT OF HATE CRIME THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED OR ANY NATURE OF THE NATURE OF ANY BIAS INHERENT IN THE ACT SO FOR THESE REASONS WE.

AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY IS A SIMPLE BUILT THE PILOT BILL THAT SUPPORTS THE PROCESS OF REPORTING A RENTAL CARS AND BASIL TO EASE THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING. STOLEN VEHICLES ARE MOVED TO BALLOTS CAR COMPANIES ON EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I DO HAVE ONE WITNESS CIRCULAR GOOD TO TELL. HIS STORY WHICH IS WHAT INSPIRED THE BILL AND I ENCOURAGED HIM TO BE BRIEF AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A COMMITTEE FOR THE HEARING THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR GIVING US THE TIME. BASICALLY I'M A WASHED UP MUSICIAN. WHO? WASHED OUT OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS AND I WOUND UP STARTING IN A VAN RENTAL COMPANY CATERING TO MUSICIANS. AND. IT WAS JUST A SINGLE VAN PARKED FOR MY APARTMENT TO AND SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS WE'VE GROWN TO HAVE. LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE U. S.. OVER THE PAST TWO TO THREE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC UPTICK IN IDENTITY THEFT. SO WE ALSO RENT TO NON MUSICIANS AS TIME WENT BY. AND. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF OUR CARS BEING STOLEN. AND WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED AS WHEN THESE VEHICLES ARE STOLEN. THEY'RE OFTEN USED TO COMMIT. FURTHER CRIMES THAT'S BEEN CONFIRMED BY. LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THAT WE'VE SPOKEN TO AS YOU KNOW IN OUR. WHERE WERE HEADQUARTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE'S BEEN? MASSIVE UPTICK IN A CAR BREAK INS. SO WHAT BASICALLY HAPPENED TO ME WAS I CUT BY PURE CHANCE US COMING BACK FROM A DENTAL APPOINTMENT AND. ONE OF OUR STOLEN VANCE HAPPEN TO PULL RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ON THE HIGHWAY. I WOUND UP FOLLOWING THE VAN I TRIED TO CALL THE POLICE TO GET THEM TO. ENGAGE. WITH THESE FOLKS UP BY THE WAY THESE PEOPLE WERE FIVE DAYS PAST DUE. AND WE HAD KNOWN EVEN BEFORE THEY WERE PAST DUE THAT WAS IDENTITY THEFT. THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF INDICATIONS. SO. THE POLICE COULDN'T HELP BECAUSE. THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LAWS. THAT. PREVENT US FROM BEING ABLE TO. TAKE CARE OF THE THE SITUATION OURSELVES IDEALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE GPS TRACKING STE WHEN A VEHICLE SLATE SO THAT WE CAN GO RECOVER THE VEHICLE OURSELVES WITHOUT INVOLVING THE POLICE. SETTING THAT ASIDE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER. IN WAIT FIVE DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE CONTRACT BEFORE WE CAN. GET THE POLICE TO HELP US. MY STORY WAS UNUSUAL WE GOT TO THE END OF IT I MANAGED TO TRICK THE THIEVES INTO GIVING US THE VEHICLE BACK SO IN THIS CASE WE DID GET THE VEHICLE BACK BUT. SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET THE VEHICLE BACK. AND SO. THIS LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF YOU HERE. NOW CURRENTLY. WILL REDUCE THE. EMBEZZLEMENT PERIOD OF FROM FIVE DAYS TO THREE DAYS UMPS HAVE JUST A LITTLE. SOMETHING TO KEEP IN THE BACK YOUR MINDS. SO OFTEN ARE RENTALS ARE FOR MULTIPLE WEEKS AND SOMETIMES MONTHS YOU KNOW BANDS GOING ON TOUR. IF SOMEBODY RENTS A VAN FOR THIRTY DAYS AND WE DISCOVER ON DAY ONE. THAT IT'S PROBABLY FRAUD BUT CAN'T PROVE IT. WE HAVE TO WAIT THIRTY FIVE DAYS BEFORE WE CAN REPORT THE VEHICLE STOLEN SO. WORK WERE TRYING TO GET. THAT GAP NARROWED A LITTLE BIT AND THEN HOPEFULLY DOWN THE ROAD. ADDRESSED THE. GPS TRACKING ISSUE AS WELL. AYE WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH. INVADING A CONSUMER PRIVACY. BUT OBVIOUSLY IF THE VEHICLES MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO. LATE BEING RETURNED I THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR US TO KNOW WHERE VEHICLES. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

PACIFIC LEAD THE BILL ALLIANCE SEARCH WARRANT PROCEDURES WITH THE REST MORE PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AB TWENTY SEVEN TEN GAMES THE WARRANT SIGNED BY THE MAGISTRATE RECEIVED BY THE OFFICER AS YOU ORIGINAL WAR REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE MAGISTRATE TO PRINT THE WARRANT. REQUIRES A LOT ELECTRONIC OATH RATHER THAN ORAL OATH MORE ANSWER. A REQUEST ELECTRONICALLY. AND MAINTAINS THE MAGISTRATE'S DISCRETION TO CALL THE OFFICER ON THE PHONE TO DISCUSS THE WAR. REQUEST WHEN APPROPRIATE WITH ME TODAY OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SPONSORED A FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. JUDGE CAL BRODY.

IMPROVE THE WAY THAT THE STATE'S JUDICIARY DOES BUSINESS USING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF. USERS OF THE COURT TO GET THERE GET THE WORK DONE GET THE WORK OF THE COURT DONE MORE EASILY AND EFFICIENTLY THIS BILL WOULD HELP ACCOMPLISH THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE. A REDUNDANT REQUIREMENT IT DATES FROM A DIFFERENT TIME BEFORE WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITY TO HAVE OFFICERS SUBMIT SEARCH WARRANTS AND ARREST WARRANTS ELECTRONICALLY. THERE ARE CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE OFFICERS SUBMIT SEARCH WARRANTS AFTER HOURS WHEN THE JUDGES ON CALL. CRAP UNDER CURRENT LAW THE. PROCESS REQUIRES THAT THE JUDGE REACH THE OFFICER BY TELEPHONE. THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE OFFICER IS ALREADY SUBMITTED A SWORN DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. ATTESTING TO THE FACT THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE ISSUANCE OF THE WARRANT THESE ARE. RECORDS THAT ARE MAINTAINED BY THE COURT FULLY. REVIEWABLE BY THE PUBLIC LATER OFFICERS STILLER ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY SAY IN THOSE WRITTEN AFFIDAVITS THE REQUIREMENT OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION RELIEF ADDS NOTHING MORE. THEN A DELAY AND IT'S NOT JUST A THEORETICAL PROBLEM IT'S A REAL PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED. TO ME AS A JUDGE. MANY TIMES HAPPENS TO MY COLLEAGUES ROUTINELY WHERE THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM.
