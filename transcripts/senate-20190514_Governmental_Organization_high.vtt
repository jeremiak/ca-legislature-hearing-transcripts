THE CONTACTS THAT COME BEFORE

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.396
THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN ARE

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:51.697
LARGE GAMING TRIBES THAT HAVE

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:54.800

VALLEY TRIBE THEY'RE EXTREMELY

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:00.973
RURAL AND THE RENT THE

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.710
RESERVATION AREA IS VERY LARGE.

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.879
AND SO THE WHO THE LUCKY BEAR

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:10.382
CASINO IS A VERY SMALL FACILITY

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:11.617
HAS.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.785
USUALLY UNDER A HUNDRED MACHINES

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.086
AND IT IS JUST REALLY ADD UP AN

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.288
AMENITY THAT IS IN THE TRIBAL

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.890
COMMUNITY WITHIN THE RESERVATION

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.625
IT DOES PROVIDE LIMITED NUMBER

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.760
OF JOBS TO TRIBAL MEMBERS.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.362
AS A IT REALLY.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:24.997
