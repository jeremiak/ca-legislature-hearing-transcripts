THE LATE START BUT I THINK YOU ALL KNOW -- THIS IS -- A CRAZY WEEK -- IN THE IN THE CAPITAL -- I HAD TO OF A MYSELF FOR THINGS SCHEDULED -- FOR OF THE THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES TO ONE ANOTHER -- BUT I'M HERE NOW AND HOPEFULLY I WILL GET CALLED TO TO GO -- MAKE A QUORUM IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT'S THE ONLY. THING THAT'S HANGING OUT THERE FOR ME -- AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA NEED ME SO THAT'LL BE OKAY -- WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET SO -- WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING -- NUMBER OF TRANSPORTATION -- DEPARTMENTS BUT WE HAVE A INFORMATION AND ONLY PRESENTATION ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION I THINK WE OUGHTA -- BEGIN WITH THAT. AND I THINK -- WE'RE PLANNING ON STARTING WITH -- AND LA -- PRESENTATION IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD. MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JUST COMPUTERS. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M AS THOUGH WE I'M GOING TO JUST MAKE A BRIEF FOR VERBAL PRESENTATION TO YOU OUR OFFICE I'M RELEASED A REVIEW OF THE STATE'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM A REPORT -- AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH -- AS PART OF THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PACKAGE THE SUPPLEMENT ALL. LANGUAGE REPORT DIRECTED OUR OFFICE TO REVIEW THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM -- AND PRESENT SOME FINDINGS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE PROJECTS AS WELL AS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. I'M JUST A A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BUDGET AND PACKAGE HAND CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL SMALLER ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS -- INTO ONE A LARGER PROGRAM THAT HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AT THAT TIME -- FOR AND THE REASON AT THAT THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN CONSOLIDATING THE SMALLER ACCOUNTS -- WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE GREATER FOCUS ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AS A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE -- AT MORE OF A A STATE ROLE IN SETTING PRIORITIES FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE STATE. SO IT HAD BEEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS SINCE THE CREATION OF THE PROGRAM AND SO THAT WAS SORT OF IMPETUS -- FOR INCLUDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PACKAGE THE REQUEST OUR OFFICE -- OR THE DIRECTION TO OUR OFFICE TO TO REVIEW THE PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE THERE HAVE BEEN -- SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED SOME FUNDING FROM THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND THIS IS BEEN THROUGH VARIOUS -- FUNDING CYCLES WHERE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL PUT OUT A CALL FOR PROJECTS -- AND AND FUND PROJECTS IN A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT BASED ON THE FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. AND 75% OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THESE TEND TO BE SMALLER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SO I'M PUTTING IN A BY CLEAN. OR A BICYCLE PATH AND BUILDING SIDEWALKS OR INSTALLING CROSSWALKS ARE OTHER PEDESTRIAN SAFETY TYPES OF FEATURES -- BUT BUT STILL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT THE REMAINING PROJECTS TEND TO BE FOR PLANNING AND AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT AND SO THERE'S THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO THE PROGRAM AND THERE'S A STATE COMPONENT WHICH GETS 50% OF THE FUNDING. THERE IS THAT METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATION OR MPO COMPONENT THAT RECEIVES 40% OF THE FUNDING AND THERE'S 10% OF THE FUNDING GOES TO THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT EACH OF THOSE THREE PROGRAM COMPONENTS TEND TO BE FUNDING THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS -- VERY SIMILAR TYPES OF PROJECTS VERY SIMILAR -- DOLLARS SIZE OF THE PROJECTS. I WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE WHILE THE PROJECTS ARE. GENERALLY VERY SMALL AND PUTTING IN A SIDEWALK OR INSTALLING AT A BIKE LANE IS NOT TYPICALLY A A HUGE DOLLAR COST COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE -- BUT THESE PROJECT DO APPEAR TO BE GETTING BIGGER OVER TIME -- ONE OF THE IDEAS WHEN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WAS CREATED IS THAT -- PULLING THE FUNDS TOGETHER WOULD ALLOW POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR MORE LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE TYPES OF ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT WOULD REALLY -- CREATE ENOUGH OF A OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN AN AREA TO ALLOW FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MODE SHIFT TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING AND SO AS YOU SEE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS GETTING LARGER AND LARGER OVER TIME. IT COULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF PROJECTS TRENDING TOWARDS BEING THE ISN'T LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS. AND WE'RE SEEING THAT ACROSS THE THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAM COMPONENTS SO NOT ONLY THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT BUT ALSO THE MPO AND THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL COMPONENT. I'M ANOTHER THING THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT IS WHAT BENEFITS THESE PROJECTS ARE ACHIEVING IN THE PROGRAM OVERALL IS ACHIEVING. SO OBVIOUSLY A PRIMARY GOAL OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE WALKING AND BIKING I'M UNFORTUNATELY THE DATA IS NOT BEING COLLECTED ON THESE OUTCOMES -- FOR THESE PROJECTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S USABLE THERE SOME DATA BEING COLLECTED BY THE WAY IT'S BEING COLLECTED AND THE TIMING OF HOW THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. REALLY WE FOUND MAKING IT YOU CAN'T REALLY PULL ANY MEANINGFUL AN OUTCOME. MEASURES ARE INSIGHTS FROM THAT DATA AND SO IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT WHETHER OR WALKING AND BICYCLING IS ACTUALLY BEING INCREASED BY THE PROGRAM. ANOTHER OUTCOME THAT WE FOUND -- AND WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT IS ON THE ON THE IMPACT ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO WE DID FIND THAT MOST PROJECTS ARE BENEFITING A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IN SOME WAY -- THAT COULD BE THE PROJECT IS WITHIN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OR IT COULD BE OUTSIDE OF A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT HAS SOME -- LINKAGE OR BENEFIT TO THAT COMMUNITY BY MAYBE PROVIDING A CONNECTION OR SOMETHING -- AND SO 88% OF THE PROJECTS HAD SOME SORT OF BENEFIT TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PROJECT CAN BE OUTSIDE OF A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BENEFIT. THE AND THE WAY THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY HAS BEEN DEFINED HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT THROUGHOUT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM WITHOUT EACH SORT OF INTEGRATION OUT OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S. DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES ON AND IN SOME CASES HAS HAS BEEN BROUGHT AND AND SO HAVING A SOMEWHAT BROAD MEASURE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY -- COULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE SEEING SUCH AS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE PROJECTS. I'M HAVING A BENEFIT TO THE DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE BUT DOES APPEAR TO BE MEETING THAT GOAL FOR THE PROGRAM THAT STATURE TRICKLE. THAT THE STATUTE PROVIDES A MINIMUM OF 25% SO IT'S IT'S WELL IN EXCESS OF THAT. AS WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THERE'S MAJOR BENEFITS TO THE STATE pCAN BE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ON THAT BENEFIT THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE A STATE HIGHWAY THAT. ESSENTIALLY TURNS INTO MAIN STREET OF A OF A CITY WHEN IT'S RUNNING THROUGH IT AS A TOWN. AND WE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DATA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME WE PREPARED THIS REPORT TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS -- BUT THEY WOULD JUST BE COMPETING FOR THE PROGRAM THE SAME AS THE OTHER PROJECTS OF THERE'S NO SPECIFIC CARVE OUT. TO BENEFIT OR NOT BENEFIT THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. I'M AND THEN WE FOUND THAT SOME OF THE OTHER GOALS AND BENEFITS I'M A SIMILAR TO THE WALKING AND BIKING ARE ARE DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE. AND DATA ON SAFETY IMPROVE OUTCOMES IS NOT AVAILABLE. ON THE SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS SUCH AS GHG REDUCTION OR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE GENERALLY GOING TO BE DRIVEN OFF AS THE DATA AVAILABLE ON INCREASED WALKING AND BIKING -- SINCE THE GHG REDUCTIONS WOULD COME FROM A MODE SHIFT OF PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO NO LONGER DRIVE AND INSTEAD TAKE AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ABOUT. SO WITHOUT THAT DATA IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL SOME OF THESE OTHER -- SORT OF TERTIARY -- BENEFITS THAT THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE. AB WE ARE ALSO ASKEDTO LOOK AT IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. SO WE FOUND THAT AND THE APPLICATION SCORING PROCESS AND THAT THE CDC HAS SAT AT I'M INTERESTED MAYBE BE SOMEWHAT DUPLICATIVE IT'S AND I'M. A QUICK REQUIRE SORT OF A A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT AND SO FOR ALL OF THE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THESE AND THREE SEPARATE POTS OF MONEY FOR THE PROGRAM WITH THE MPO AND THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL POT. AS WELL AS THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT -- IT ANY PROJECT WANTING TO COMPETE FOR ANY OF THOSE THREE POTS HAS TO FIRST COMPETE IN THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM. WHICH MEANS FILLING OUT AN APPLICATION AND APPLYING TO THE CTC AND GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND THEN PROJECTS THAT DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- WHAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN THE MPO AND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY'RE LOCATED WITHIN THAT REGION -- AND SO THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND IS IS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CTC SCORES THESE PROJECTS THAT WITH OUR AND STAFF THEY ALSO USE VOLUNTEERS TO SCORE THE PROJECTS. AND THERE COULD BE SOME INCONSISTENCIES THERE THE PROCESS DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT DUPLICATIVE AND SO JUST KEEPING THAT IN BACK OF MIND AS YOU THINK ABOUT CHANGES YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE TO THE PROGRAM. THAT HOW IS THAT GOING TO AFFECT THE THE C. D. C.'S OVERALL ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. SO IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE AND THAT SORT OF THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS REQUIRE BETTER DATA COLLECTION -- WE ARE ASKED TO LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROGRAM THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE THERE ISN'T DATA TO SHOW THE KEY. METRIC OF IS THIS INCREASING WALKING OR BIKING THERE IS SOME DATA BEING COLLECTED THE QUALITY OF THE DATA FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WE THOUGHT WAS SO POOR THAT IT REALLY WASN'T USABLE IN SOME CASES IT GAVE COUNTERINTUITIVE RESULTS AND IT JUST DIDN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE AND SO WE REALLY. THOUGHT THAT WAS. THE QUALITY OF THE DATA I'M CALTRANS NOTED IN AND ONE OF THEIR UPDATE REPORTS SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE DATA. SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS JUST YOU KNOW INSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS COLLECTING GOOD DATA SO YOU CAN EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES. I'M A COLLECTING IN A ROBUST DATA ON PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLISTS COUNTS. CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A REALLY SMALL PROJECT IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE IN ALL OF THOSE CASES AND SO YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PROJECTS. DOES THAT MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO COLLECT THIS DATA ON AND HAVE. A MEANINGFUL BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN COUNTS AND WHICH PROJECTS DO YOU JUST YOU KNOW SAY. WERE FIXING THE SMALL AREA OF SIDEWALK AND THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT WORTH GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF AS I'M DOING THESE YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE LENGTHY AND COUNTS. SO IT THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE IS REALLY TO JUST CONSIDER WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM SO IN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WAS. CREATED AGAIN THAT THE IDEA WAS TO GIVE THE STATE'S SAM ROLE IN SETTING PRIORITIES. I'M AND BRING GREATER FOCUS TO THE PROGRAM AND SO. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE RIGHT COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM AND COMPARE IT TO THE REGIONAL COMPONENTS THE MPO -- AND THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL WE'RE FINDING THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS ACROSS ALL THREE OF THESE COMPONENTS. AND SO IT REALLY SEEMS THAT EACH OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ARE ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO MEET THE SAME GOALS. I'M AND WE'RE NOT SEEING A REAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHY THE STATE AS HAVING A ROLE IN SELECTING CERTAIN PROJECTS WHEN WE OVER ALL SEEM TO BE FINDING THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED IF. WE WERE ALLOWING -- REGIONS TO JUST CHOOSE THE PROJECTS THEMSELVES. AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE CAN DEFINITELY BE BENEFITS OF HAVING A STATEWIDE ROLE AND STATE PRODUCT SELECTION AND PRIORITIZATION. THERE CAN BE THESE LARGER TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND YOU KNOW ARE REALLY GOING TO BE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MODE SHIFT. AND BUT I SPANIEL SMALL COMMUNITY IT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT PROJECT ON THEIR OWN AND SO HAVING A YOU KNOW A POT OF FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE RIGHT COMPONENT. TO REALLY PUT PUT A LOT MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE CITY OR JURISDICTION COULD MAYBE PUT INTO A PROJECT COULD BE A REAL BENEFIT AND THAT WAY TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN TERMS OF ALL WHY IS THE STATE INVOLVED IN ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THINGS. THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO OTHERWISE -- AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO CONSIDER YOUCOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT ROLE FOR THE STATE RIGHT COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT GIVEN THE RATIONALE ON THE REASONS WHY THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED. FOCUSING THAT PIECE ON THESE LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS SEEM TO MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE TO US. SO THEN IF IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY CHANGING WHAT THAT FOCUS OF THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM GOES TILL. THEN IT ALSO YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW ARE YOU CHANGING POTENTIALLY THE REGIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM -- IF THE STATE'S FOCUSING ON THESE LARGER PROJECTS SHOULD THE REGION'S HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO FOCUS ON EITHER SMALLER PROJECTS OR JUST OTHER PROJECTS THAT FROM THEIR REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS. AND SO THAT'S THE LAST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE JUST THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER GIVING MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE M. P. O.'S. ON AS YOU THINK ABOUT MAKING THESE POTENTIALLY STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF HOW THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM FUNDING GOES OUT AND WHAT GOALS TO DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. YOU'RE GONNA NATURALLY WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED -- IF YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM TRYING TO MEET DIFFERENT GOALS WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE MPO THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS FLOWING THROUGH CTC. AND HAVING THEM COMPETE FOR A PROGRAM THAT REALLY THOSE PROJECTS MAYBE OUR TICKET. FOR FOR AND SO WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO MAYBE GIVING SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE PO'S -- THAT COULD BE DONE BY AND JUST GIVING THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE PROJECTS AND NOT RESTRICTING THEM TO THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT FIRST COMPETE AND DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING TO THE STATE PROGRAM. I'M OR COULD BE DONE BY A GIVING ALMOST MORE OF LIKE A BLOCK GRANT TO THE M. PO'S AND LETTING THEM JUST CHOOSE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE REGION. AND THEN PUTTING SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- ON THOSE REGIONS TO TO LET THE STATE NOW WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE FUNDS AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES WERE -- SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND A SUMMARY OF A REPORT AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE'S NO QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW WHEN WE MOVE ON TO THE MR FONG SORRY. A JUST A CURIOSITY IN TERMS OF THE DATA COLLECTION -- HOW IS IT DONE NOW? HOW IS IT A COLLECTED WHAT QUESTIONS THEY ASK I'M JUST? SO CURRENTLY AND THAT THERE ARE. AT IN SOME CASES THERE'S AND PEDESTRIAN BICYCLIST COUNTS HAPPENING BEFORE THE PROJECT JUST AT SOME POINT BEFORE THE PROJECT IS DONE. AND THEN WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT OF THERE IS THAT -- PROJECT AND SO -- SOME OF THE ISSUE SOME PROJECTS JUST DIDN'T DO THE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN COUNT MANY OF THEM DEAD THE PROBLEM IS THAT AND THERE WAS INCONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES. SO AND WE WERE GIVEN ONE AND SAMPLE PROJECT TO LOOK AT AND IN THAT CASE THE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN COUNT THAT IT HAPPENED. BEFORE THE PROJECT AND THIS WAS A PROJECT AND TO INCREASE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AROUND A PARTICULAR SCHOOL. AND SO THAT PROJECT -- THAT THE COUNTS BEFOREHAND DID A SURVEY OF THE PARENTS AND IT WAS LIKE IT LATE SUMMER SO PROBABLY AROUND THE VERY START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS PROBABLY GOOD AND THE METHODOLOGY WAS TO SURVEY THE PARENTS AND SAY HEY WALKIE HAVING YOUR KIDS WALK TO SCHOOL IS A GREAT THING HOW YOU KNOW HOW MANY. HOW HOW OFTEN YOUR KIDS WALK IN SO THERE CAN BE SOME IMPLICIT BIAS THAN IN THE THE THE METHODOLOGY USED? AS WELL AS THE WEATHER AND THE TIMING YOU KNOW THE START OF SCHOOL MAYBE MORE KIDS ARE WALKING. THE FOLLOW UP WITHIN SIX MONTHS LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER -- WHERE YOU KNOW MAYBE THE WEATHER WAS GOOD BUT MAYBE NOT -- IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR AND THE METHODOLOGY WAS DIFFERENT IN THAT CASE THERE WAS -- STATIONARY CAMERAS THAT WERE IN THE AREA AND THOSE WERE USED TO DO MANUAL COUNTS OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WERE WALKING ON THE CAMPUS. AND SORT OF AND SURPRISINGLY IT SHOWS THAT THE PROJECT RESULTED IN LESS AFTER FOR INTERPRETATION BUT THOSE RESULTS ARE REALLY MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH INCONSISTENCY IN THE METHODOLOGY THAT. DOESN'T. SO THERE SHOULD BE A UNIFORM AT THE DOLLAR TREE AND AND EVALUATING ALL THESE PROJECTS EXACTLY AND ALLOWING ENOUGH TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW WITH HAVING THAT THE COMPLETION REPORTS DO WITHIN SIX MONTHS -- THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TIME FOR USERS TO ACTUALLY MAKE A CHANGE TO DECIDE -- HE THERE'S THIS REALLY NICE BIKE PATH I'M GOING TO USE IT -- AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE LOOKING AT MAYBE THE SAME TIME OF YEAR -- SINCE YOU KNOW ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS GONNA BE PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE WEATHER. THE OTHER BEST PRACTICES THAT EXIST. IN OTHER A GRANT MATTER TO ME FEEL FREE TO CHIME AND I'M I'M I'M. GATHERING INFORMATION JUST TRAILER -- MY NAME IS SUSAN BRANSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION I'M HERE AT LAURIE WATERS THE COMMISSION CHECK TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MANAGER. AND WITH REGARD TO THE OUTCOMES OF THIS PROGRAM. IT IS A CONCERN THAT WE SHARE WITH THE LA L. THE PROJECTS ARE JUST NOW FROM THE FIRST CYCLE OF FUNDING. COMING TO COMPLETION AND SO WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST REPORT FROM CALTRANS LAST YEAR. AND SO IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW A WE ARE WORKING WITH CALTRANS AFTER TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS T. HAVE UNIFORM. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING WE ALSO THROUGH THE STATE WIDE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THERE IS A FINDING THAT THE COMMISSION -- DEDICATES TO AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER AND THROUGH THAT RESOURCE CENTER -- WE ARE AT WE HAVE FUNDED FOR THE RESOURCE CENTER TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING AND THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. UNIFORM COUNTER METHODOLOGY -- TOOL. THAT ESSENTIALLY WILL BE USED -- AND CHECKED OUT BY AGENCIES ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS PROGRAM. THEY CAN BORROW THIS TOOL AND GO OUT AND CONDUCT THEIR USER ACCOUNTS AND THAT SHOULD STANDARDIZE INCREASED UNIFORMED DATA. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGIES ACCOUNT FOR SEASONAL VARIATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE THAT WE WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE LA US REPORT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN ON OUR YOU KNOW VERY CONCERNING TO THE COMMISSION THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING. SHE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM. MS RIVER SEND THEM AS GARCIA. MY QUESTION WAS IF ANY OF THESE EIGHTY P. -- PROJECTS TARGET AREAS NEAR SCHOOLS I KNOW YOU JUST MENTION AN EXAMPLE BUT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE OR THE WE TRACK IF. IF THESE PROJECTS ARE NEAR SCHOOLS. I'M YES SO. AND AND IN MY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SETTING UP OF THE PROGRAM AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE COMPLICATED SO WHEN THERE WERE DIFFERENT AND SMALLER PROGRAMS INITIALLY ONE OF THOSE WAS A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND SO THAT WAS COMBINED. AND THEIR CERTAIN THE MONEY'S THERE THAT AND YOU. HAVE TO BE USED FOR THAT SO IT'S AND THE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION FOR THE COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO PICK THE PROJECTS THAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BUT WITHIN THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME SORT OF SMALLER. SUB. POTS OF MONEY OR SUB PROGRAMS AND SO YES THAT IS DEFINITELY A FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM IN AND OUT OF MISPRINTS AND HAS MORE. TO YEAH I WOULD WANT TO ASSURE YOU SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS IS A KEY A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE PROGRAM. LAURIE HAS SOME STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON THAT. YES BECAUSE THE THE INITIAL LEGISLATION AND CREATED THE PROGRAM IT ACTUALLY MENTIONS SPECIFICALLY THAT -- TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO WALK AND BIKE SO AND OUR EVALUATION PROCESS WE ACTUALLY GIVE ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT STUDENTS. AND I WOULD SAY AT LEAST ABOUT CYCLE OUR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROJECTS. THIS GARCIA. YEAH. WHAT HAPPENS IF AN ORGANIZATION pTHE DATA AND SHARING IT WITH EVEN IF IT WAS AND THE BEST PRACTICES BUT SOMEONE NOT EVEN COLLECTING THE DATA WHAT HAPPENS? THEN. TO TO THE ORGANIZATION IS THERE ANY SORT OF CONSEQUENCE ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M I I WILL I WILL LET THAT TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ANSWER THAT ONE JUST SINCE THEY'RE MORE INVOLVED WITH SETTING WHAT DATE IT BUT I THINK. PART OF THE ISSUE IS JUST THE WAY THAT THAT. THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT IT WITHIN THE SIX MONTH TIME PERIOD REALLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR SOME OF THESE BEST PRACTICES. AND SO. THERE EAT YOU YOU COULD HAVE A PROJECT SPONSOR THAT IS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE STILL AND THAT PROVIDING DATA THAT'S KINDA USELESS. AND LET'S NOT USE I MEAN I GET THE USELESS DATA PURPOSE SO THEY TRY TO I'M NOT TRYING TO TING ON THAT BUT THEN YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY DATA I'M ASKING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY. SURE YEAH SO A IT SOMEWHERE IT DIFFICULT ONCE YOU'VE ALREADY FUNDED THE PROJECT BUT I WILL LET AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES ON THAT. AS OF JUNE YEAH I'VE I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT -- THERE IS NOT A STANDARDIZED WAY TO COLLECT DATA ANYWHERE SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS STATE OF THE ART IS NOT ANOTHER. PROGRAM. LIKE THIS IN THE COUNTRY SO. THERE ARE NOT STANDARDIZED WAYS TO COLLECT DATA SO AND SUSAN HAD MENTIONED WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE H. D. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER. AND OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH THE STANDARDIZED WAYS. AND SO. IT ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THE DATA IS SOME OF THESE FACILITIES ARE BRAND NEW FACILITIES SO THEY'RE NOT THERE YET SO THERE'S NO WAY TO COLLECT DATA ON SOMETHING THAT IS HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET. SO THE WAY THAT THE APPLICANT HAS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH DATA IS FIND A MAYBE LIKE A PARALLEL ROUTE THAT THEY CAN USE AS AS A PROXY FOR WHAT THE WHAT THE FACILITY WILL WILL DO AFTER IT'S BUILT. SO I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES. FOR A APPLICANT THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE DATA BUT WE WE WILL WE HAVE A REPORTING PROCESS AND WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING. ALL OF THE REPORTS IN ON TIME AND ACCURATE. AND IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE COMMISSION HAS STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES IN PLACE. WITHIN THIS PROGRAM AND JUST AS AN OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY GUIDELINES THE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED. IT CALLS FOR AUDITS OF THESE AGENCIES IT CALLS FOR A REGULAR REPORTING AND WHEN THE REGULAR REPORTING IS NOT OCCURRING WE FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- WHERE THERE IS NON COMPLIANCE? OVERALL WITH THE EXPENDITURES OF THESE FUNDS YES A EIGHT ORGANIZATION RECEIVES THE FUNDS. AND DOES NOT -- COMPLY YOU KNOW THE SCOPE. OF THE PROJECT BILL TO DIFFERENT PROJECT YOU KNOW THERE'S IF THERE'S A REPAYMENT MECHANISM IN PLACE IN THE STATE TO REAP RETURN THOSE FUNDS. IN THE CASE OF THE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM. WE NEED TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE HAVE THAT GROUNDED -- METHODOLOGY IN PLACE THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS AND WE PROVIDE THE TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN -- THESE AGENCIES CAN -- YOU KNOW CAPTURE THE DATA THAT THEY NEED TO REPORT BUT THE TIMELINESS OF REPORTING. IS AN ISSUE AND WE EXPECT OUR REPORTING TO HAPPEN TIMELY. ARE WE DO BRING THESE REPORTS TO THE COMMISSION MEETING. AND THE CONSIDER THOSE SO CALTRANS IS REALLY THE AGENCY THAT IS SPEARHEADING THE REPORTING. AND I KNOW THAT THEY ARE ON TOP OF IT -- AND SO I HAVE -- I HAVE ONE OF THESE PROJECTS THAT THIS. GOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE CITY I LIVE IN -- AND THE RESULT OF IT HAS BEEN TROUBLING TO SCENE BUT THEY DID IT'S UNDER THIS YEAR'S CORRIDOR AND WE DO HAVE SCHOOLS THERE -- BOTH ELEMENTARY MIDDLE SCHOOLS ON THAT THIS YEAR'S CORRIDOR THEY RECENTLY INCREASED THE SPEED LIMIT TO FORTY MILES PER HOUR ON THAT FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTS ARE MOVING THROUGH THEIR BRAVERY. AND SO THEY PUT UP A COUPLE OF SIGNS TELLING US TO SHARE THE ROAD WITH THE CYCLIST. AND THEY AND THEY PAINTED THE BICYCLE LIKE THIS IS NOW SHERRY LANE BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT WAS ADDED ON TO THE PROJECT. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DIVISION THERE'S NO SPACE AND IT'S A PRETTY. HAVE A GOOD CAR DOOR -- I GOT THE LETTER WHEN THEY RECEIVED A GRANT THAT'S WHY I KNEW WAS COMING. I WROTE THE LETTER IN SUPPORT BUT IT IS TROUBLING TO ME TO SEE THEN HOW IS BEING IMPLEMENTED -- IN MY HOME TOWN OR TAKE A WE'RE TRYING TO GET FOLKS. TO WALK AND RIDE THE BIKES INCLUDING THE KIDS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING AND HOW THIS IS IMPLEMENTED. THAT WOULD RESULT IN THAT AS AND YOU KNOW. I AND SO MUCH IS THE DATA BUT THEN TRACKING MAKE IT I AT THE DATA WILL HELP US WITH THAT DOWN THE ROAD RIGHT I GET IT TO THE DATA WILL SHOW. THERE'S NO IMPROVEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE SHOULD THIS PROJECT EVEN HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THIS WAY OUR CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT A MAKING SURE. WE ARE -- GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH -- IN CITIES LIKE MINE I HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE CITIES THAT'S YOU KNOW PART OF THESE. ARE URBAN COMMUNITIES ARE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IT'S COMMUNITIES IF I TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUR FAIR SHARE AND SO WE'RE DOING MORE OF THAT HERE AT THE CAPITOL BUT AND WHAT EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT. JUST YOU KNOW -- PRETENDING TO BE DAYS THAT THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE AN AND WE SHARE THAT THE DATA IS CRITICAL RIGHT NOW THE DATA IS OUR OUR KEY FOCUS. AND IS SOMETHING THAT -- THE COMMISSION HAS DEDICATED THROUGH THE STATE WHAT COMPONENT FUNDING. FOR FOR THESE DATE ACCOUNTS IN MEASURES AND WE ARE WORKING WITH CALTRANS BECAUSE THIS LESSON THAT YOU JUST SHARED WITH THIS IS A LESSON THAT WE LEARNED AND WE CANNOT COME CANNOT REPEATED. SO IT MAY REQUIRE IT LIKELY WILL REQUIRE THAT WE ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ABOUT PROJECTS WHEN THEY ARE NOMINATED FOR FUNDING. AND SO -- YOU KNOW IT THIS PROGRAM AT EATEN EVERY CYCLE WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING THE PROGRAM. AND THE EARLY AS REPORT IS A KEY REPORT THAT WE WILL USE IN OUR DISCUSSIONS MOVING FOR IT. AND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARED WILL LOOK INTO YOUR PROJECT AND I WILL. MAKE SURE MY STEP GETS YOU THE PICTURES TO THE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TAKEN PICTURES OF WHAT THIS PROJECT TURNED OUT TO BE OKAY THANK YOU. ALRIGHT LET'S UP PAUSE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THAT -- TAKE UP THE OF WHAT ONLY CALENDAR. BLOOM HERE FONG. GARCIA [inaudible] MULLIN PATTERSON [inaudible] YES [inaudible] PREVIOUS YEAR. WE HAVE THE TO VOTE ONLY -- VOTES -- WILL -- HANDLE ITEM ONE SEPARATELY IS OUR MOTION ON ITEM ONE WE HAVE [inaudible] I'M SORRY [inaudible] THREE ONE I SEE ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA DO ISSUE TO SEPARATELY SO IS THERE A MOTION ON ISSUE [inaudible] TO THEIR SECOND. BLOOM HI FONG. GARCIA HI MULLIN PATTERSON. RIGHT YES -- REBUS. NOW I'D LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE REMAINING ITEMS WHICH WOULD THAT BE ISSUES ONE AND ISSUES THREE THROUGH. TWELVE BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA [inaudible] MULLIN PATTERSON [inaudible] RAMOS [inaudible] REVERSE. GREAT THANK YOU SO -- BACK TO YOU I THINK YOU PROBABLY COVERED SOME OF YOUR TALKING POINTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE QUESTIONS BUT YOU NEEDN'T REPEAT YOURSELF -- MISTER MULLINS HER WHEN WE LET HIM OUT ON AND THEN WE'LL. FOR EFFICIENCY SAKE WILL BE DONE WITH THAT PART OF THE CALENDAR. MR MILLER WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO ADD ON AND THE OF VOTE ONLY CALENDAR NOW AND THEN YOU'LL BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP. WILL BE COMPLETELY [inaudible] THE COULD BE A FIRST YEAH PLEASE. SO ISSUES ONE AND THREE THREE TWELVE THERE WAS A MOTION TO APPROVE. MULLIN. IN ISSUE TWO ALSO A MOTION TO APPROVE MULLIN. GREAT. THANK YOU. AND SO AND I DID HAVE A FEW AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ACT TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM TODAY -- I THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO AGAIN THANK THE LA OF FOR THE REVIEW AND AS I I ALSO WANTED TO ASSURE YOU THAT. WE DO AT THE COMMISSION WITH EACH FUNDING CYCLE MOVE FOR TO TO WORK TO IMPROVE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. AND SO WE WILL TAKE THE LA -- RECOMMENDATIONS OF FORD FOR FOR A ROBUST DISCUSSION IN THE NEXT CYCLE OF FUNDING I DID WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION SCORING. OF PROJECT APPLICATIONS WITH YOU TODAY -- YOU KNOW WE HAD REQUIRED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE NPOS TO FIRST APPLY IN THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM. FOR FUNDING -- IT WAS JUST HAPPENED THIS FIRST THIS LAST TIME AND THE REASON WAS TO IMPROVE OUR DATA COLLECTION. EFFORTS WE WERE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH THAT IN THAT AREA SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD PUT IN PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT IN LIGHT OF THE EARLY AS A REPORT. WE WILL WORK WITH EVERYONE ON THAT AND AND IT JUST AS NECESSARY. AS FAR AS THE DUPLICATIVE PROCESS THE COMMISSION UTILIZES THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY ADVISORY TEAM AS REQUIRED IN STATUTE TO REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS. ARE THE COMMISSION STAFF DOES REVIEW EVERY APPLICATION FOR PURPOSES OF NORMALIZING THE SCORING. IN ENSURING CONSISTENCY ACROSS ACROSS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY REVIEW TEAMS -- WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS IN THE COMMISSION STAFF SCORING FROM THAT MULTI DISCIPLINARY ADVISORY -- MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS THE COMMISSION STAFF IS MEETING WITH THOSE TEAMS AND RESOLVING THOSE DISCREPANCIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PROCESS IS NECESSARY AGAIN TO NORMALIZING ENSURE CONSISTENCY OF SCORING. WE HAVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS SO THAT -- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THE APPLICATIONS ARE YOU VALUE IS CONSISTENTLY. WE'VE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE PROGRAM OUTCOMES SO I WON'T AND I WON'T REPEAT WHAT WE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTS SIZES. DID WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TREAT LARGE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS. THE COMMISSION IN THE LAST CYCLE DID REALLY ENCOURAGE -- APPLICATIONS THAT WOULD BE BRING AFFORD PROJECTS THAT ARE LARGE AND TRANSFORMATIVE IN THIS STATE WHITE COMPONENT. AND SO AS A RESULT THE COMMISSION DID FIND MORE LARGE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS MORE THAN IT EVER HAS. BUT THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTED TO LARGE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL PARTS. OF THE STATE ARE WELL SERVED ENOUGH FORGOTTEN IN THAT IN THAT COMPONENT. AND IN THE OVERALL PROGRAM. IN THE LAST THREE I JUST ON THE WITH REGARD -- TO PROVIDING A LUMP SUM TO THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. WE ARE. WE AGREE WITH THE LA -- THAT IF THE LUMP SUM IF TRUMPS SUMS WERE GIVEN TO THE REGIONAL COMPONENT IT WOULD REMOVE FROM THE COMMISSION'S PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT -- THAT IT CURRENTLY HAS. AND THIS COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SENATE BILL ONE ACCOUNTABILITY OF REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE COMMISSION'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES. AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRING TIMELY IS A FUND SET OF PROJECTS DON'T MOVE FOR TIMELY -- THE THE PROJECT SPONSOR FORFEIT SAYS FUNDS AND THE FUNDS CAN BE REDIRECTED TO PROJECT THAT IS READY TO MOVE FORWARD. SO OVERALL I JUST WANTED TO ASSURE YOU KNOW YOU ALL THE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE COMMISSION TAKES THIS PROGRAM VERY SERIOUSLY. WITH EACH CYCLE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE IT. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THE COMMISSION SO FAR. TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME IS REYES. I DO WANNA SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ARE UNINCORPORATED. AREAS OR CITIES. HOW ARE FUNDS DISTRIBUTED TO THE SERVERS WERE WITHOUT A DOUBT THESE THEY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS -- WITH THESE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE WE WILL WHEN THEY'RE PLAYING FOR SEA TO SEA BUT ALSO ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE APPLYING TO THE M. P. O.'S -- YEAH. HOW HOW IS THIS DISTRIBUTED AND? WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND? THIRTY ONE ON THE WAY YES I AM EIGHT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SO THERE'S THE MPO COMPONENT WHICH IS THE TEN LARGEST NPOS CAM -- HAVE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND SO I I THINK THAT YEARS SPECIFICALLY ASKING ABOUT THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS THAT ARE WITH IN ONE OF THOSE LARGE NPOS. SO ANY ANY ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS CAN. SUBMIT THROUGH THE STATE WIDE PROCESS SO THEY HAVE A FIRST CHANCE THAT THEY CAN GET FUNDED OUT OF THE STATE WIDE PROCESS. IN ANY ANY PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE THE FIRST CHANCE THERE AND THEN THEY EITHER COMPETE IN THE SMALLER BUT IN RURAL COMPONENT OR THE MPO COMPONENT. SO THEN THEY CAN ALSO GET FUNDED THROUGH OUT OF THE THROUGH THE MPO COMPONENT. DO YOU FIND THAT THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS -- IT THERE THERE. THEY'RE BEING COMPETITIVE IN THEIR APPLICATIONS. WE'RE FOR IT IN MY AREA MY DISTRICT WE HAVE TWO ONE INCORPORATED AREAS. THAT -- FROM WHAT I SEE GET OVERLOOKED. AND IS IT WOULD MAKE THE COUNTY IS LOOKING FOR ALL OF THE CITIES AND THEY DON'T ZERO IN ON THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS WHERE'S THE CITIES. THEY WERE GOING TO ZERO IN ON THE CITIES AND THEY HAVE ACCOUNTED BACK THEN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THE STATE WIDE COMPONENT -- IT OFFERS THE ABILITY FOR AN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY TO APPLY. FOR FUNDING TO THE STATE Y. COMPONENT AND THE COMMISSION HAS FUNDED A I MENTIONED EARLIER THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER. AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT -- IS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANYONE THAT IS INTERESTED IN THAT ASSISTANCE BUT REALLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS A IS A OF THOSE AND INCORPORATED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW THE WRITING APPLICATIONS MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ALSO HAVE. THIS LAST CYCLE BASED ON FEEDBACK AND HAVE MODIFIED THE APPLICATION -- FOR REQUIREMENTS SO THAT NOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS. A TEAM THOSE PROJECTS TEND TO BE THE LOWER DOLLAR VALUES SMALLER PROJECTS AND NOW THEY NEED TO A THEIR APPLICATION LESS INFORMATION.

IN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PLAN. THANK YOU ANY -- COMMENTS QUESTIONS. BUT SIR COVER ISSUE FIVE AND THEN. AND WE'RE GONNA I DO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER SHE FIVE GOOD MORNING DAVID I'M NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THREE PAY ALL OUTSTANDING LOANS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS. TO THE GENERAL FUND AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROADER APPROACH OF PAYING OFF THE STATE'S BUDGETARY THAT BUILDING ADDITIONAL RESERVES AND PAYING DOWN OTHER. LIABILITIES. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE GENERAL HUNDRED HE PAID THE OUTSTANDING LOAN OF THE APPROXIMATELY IN UNDER THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE TRANSPORTATION DEBT SERVICE FUND. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE USED TO BAIL THAT -- BOND AT SERVICE FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THANK YOU -- ALEJO COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS. MR FONG. SO JUST SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS -- SO THE THE CUT UP MAYBE THAT PART OF AND AS GOOD AS THIS SO YOU'RE THE TRUCK WHAT FEES YOU GONNA BE. THAT WERE BEING USED TO PAY FOR THESE LOANS ARE YOU GONNA PAY THOSE OFF. CORRECT WITH WITH THE PAID UP OFF EARLY CORRECT. YES SO -- THAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO TRANSFER THE REMAINING -- GENERAL FUND DEBT. TO THE TRANSMISSION AT SERVICE FUND A ONE YEAR BUT THEN WOULD HAPPEN UNDER BUSINESS AS USUAL SCHEDULE YES OKAY SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE TRUCK WAIT FEES AFTER THE BONDS ARE PAID OFF. SO THOSE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE USED TO PAY OFF THE DEBT SERVICE. BUT THE DEBT SERVICE WITH THE LOANS ARE PAID OFF THERE WOULD BE NO DEBT SERVICE THE GENERAL FUND PORTION -- THE GENERAL FUND THAT PORTION WOULD BE PAID OFF BUT THE TRUCK WAIT THESE WOULD CONTINUE BE USED TO PAY OFF THE DEBT SERVICE ON THE ANNUAL BASIS. SO HOW MUCH IS THAT. AND ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR MORE OR LESS. POINT AND I CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOUR OFFICE IF YOU'D LIKE A MORE EXACT ESTIMATES. SO OKAY SO THEN YOU ARE. YOU'RE PAYING OFF ONLY THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF THE OF THE DEBT IS NOT THE FOR THAT SERVICE. CORRECT SO THAT THE STATE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE TO PAY THAT SERVICE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THIS PROPOSAL IS -- TO ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF THE DEBT THAT IT WAS ENCOURAGE -- INTO THE BUDGET. AS OPPOSED TO SPENDING SPENDING OVER TWO YEARS. OKAY SO THEN AT SOME POINT THE BONDS WILL BE PAID OFF. COMPLETELY -- CORRECT AND I BELIEVE THESE ARE THIRTY YEAR BOND THAT HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME UNTIL THE CONCERT. OKAY THEN SO BUT OVER TIME AS THE DEBT SERVICE GET SMALLER. THAN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TRUCK WE'D BE SO THEY STILL GO THROUGH THEY STILL CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR THE GENERAL FOR FRIGHTENS OF JOHN FUND OR DO THEY GET AT SOME POINT GET MOVED TO BACK TO TRANSPORTATION [inaudible] SO. HELLO STEVE WELCH PART IN A FINANCE SO OVER TIME AS WAIT FEES. ARE AS DEBT SERVICE -- FOR BECOME LESS THAN ONE THEN THE AMOUNT THEY WERE COLLECTING ANNUALLY WAIT FEES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AMOUNTS WILL REMAIN IN THE WHO TO AND BE DISTRIBUTED AS PART OF THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS -- AND A STEP AND SHOP PROGRAM. SO THE RIGHT NOW THE THERE THERE IS A ALL OF THE WEIGHT FEES HAVE TO GO TO COVERING BECAUSE THERE'S MORE DEBT SERVICE THAN THERE IS WAIT FEES. BUT EVENTUALLY AS AS WE PAY OFF DEBT. SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND IN THE VICINITY OF TWENTY THIRTY SIX TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN THAT THE TOTAL THAT SERVICE WILL BE LESS THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT FEES WE'VE COME TO COLLECT AND AT THAT POINT. THOSE WAIT FEES WILL THEN SEE WHAT AND REMAIN IN THE IN THE HOOD TO BE USED FOR US THE SIMPLY DOT TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. MR FUNG I CAN SEE -- THAT MISS PETERS IS CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO ADD A COMMENT HERE FEEL FREE. TO JUST TO CLARIFY SO THAT THE THE WEEK FEEL LOANS THAT ARE IN AS PART OF THIS ITEM -- COMES FROM WE WHEN THE STATE WAS IN THE FISCAL CRISIS AND NEEDING GENERAL FUND BUDGET SOLUTIONS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WEIGHT FEES THAT ONE BILLION ASH COMING IN EACH YEAR WAS USED TO HELP THE GENERAL FUND. AND IT WAS DONE SO BY PRIMARILY PAYING THAT THAT SERVICE ON TRANSPORTATION MONTHS BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS STARTED. THE THE DEBT SERVICE I'M PRAYING PRIMARILY ON I PROPOSITION ONE BEAT WITH THE LAST THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT FEES AND SO THE BALANCE IN ORDER TO FULLY BENEFIT FROM THE WEIGHT FEES WAS LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO THOSE ARE THE LOAN SO AND THEN. AS THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE NOW HAS GROWN AND EXCEEDS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WEEK FEES THOSE LOANS ARE REPAID TO TRANSPORTATION TO PAY OFF THE DEBT SERVICE AMOUNTS THAT ARE HIGHER. SO THAT BONDS ARE STILL BEING REPAID ACCORDING TO THE SAME FEEL LIKE THERE'S PLANNED THERE SHOULD BE A FLOW CHART HERE. SO SELFISH. SO WALK ME THROUGH THIS ONE MORE TIME SO THERE WAS SO IF YOU HAD SAY A BILLION DOLLARS IN A WEEK FEES COMING IN IN YEAR ONE AND THAT THAT SERVICE THAT NEEDED TO BE PAID IN THAT YOU'RE IN TRANSPORTATION BONDS WAS. SIX HUNDRED MILLION THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DIFFERENCE WAS A LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND AND NOT HAPPEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS THE TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON TRANSPORTATION BONDS WITH INCREASING A LOT OF THE STATE SERVICES COMING FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SIX PROP WHEN BE BOND AND SO IT'S STILL. INCREASING. SO EACH YEAR THAT DIFFERENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE TO THE GENERAL FUND NOW THAT DEBT SERVICE COSTS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE WEIGHT FEES. AND SO THOSE FUNDS THAT WERE LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND COME BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION DEBT SERVICE ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THOSE HIGHER DEBT SERVICE COSTS. SO THE LOAN WAS NOT AT SERVICE HIGHER. IT GROWS OVER TIME AS THE BONDS ARE SOLD SO -- PROPOSITION ONE BE WAS A ROUGHLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR BOND AND SO THE STATE STARTED SELLING THOSE BONDS AND PROBABLY ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUT STILL YOU KNOW DON'T SELL THEM ALL AT ONCE SOME OF THEM OVER YEARS AS PROJECTS ARE ARE COMING ON LINE. AND SO THOSE COSTS WOULD GROW OVER TIME UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR PEAK AND THEN EVENTUALLY TRAIL OFF SO THEY STARTED WHEN THE BOND COSTS ARE STILL RISING -- AND THAT'S WHERE THAT LITTLE LOAN PEACE COMES FROM AND SO THE PIECE. ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION IT'S JUST THAT THE REMAINING AMOUNT THAT HAVE BEEN LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND NOW WE'LL GO BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVICE FINE. AND WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR THE FUTURE YEARS TO PAY OFF THOSE INCREASED DEBT SERVICE COSTS. SO WE'RE SO WE'RE PAYING OFF. WHO WOULD BE THE WORK WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA A U. THIS PROBE BEING PROPOSED AT EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN THREE MILLION DOLLARS? AND WAY FEES. WILL BE NOW USED TO PAY DOWN THE THE THE GENERAL FUND LOW. THAT WILL PAY OFF ALL THE MONIES THAT WENT TO THE GENERAL FUND -- TO BE USED IN THE GENERAL FUND WHILE WE'RE SORT OF WAITING FOR THOSE THAT SERVICE COSTS TO GET HIGH ENOUGH TO USE THEM FOR TRANSPORTATION BONDS OKAY SO THEN NOW THE TRANSPORTATION DEBT SERVICE COSTS. ARE HIGH ENOUGH THAT THE FUNDS CAN BE TRANSFERRED BACK. BACK TO THE DEBT SERVICE FUND AND WILL BE USED TO PAY DEBT SERVICE COSTS THIRTY SENSUALLY ALLOW IT ALLOW THE GENERAL FUND TO FULLY BENEFIT FROM THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WEEK FEES. AND STILL ESSENTIALLY SET THAT MONEY ASIDE TO PAY FOR THOSE BOND BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THE BOND COSTS WEREN'T. QUITE HIGH ENOUGH TO FULLY USE UP ALL THOSE. AND THEN NOW IT'S BIGGER PIC. OKAY THAT WAS A VERY COMPLICATED ANSWER BUT OKAY SO AT THE END BUT YOU'RE PAYING THIS THIS THIS LOAN BACK EARLY. RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE EARLY. CORRECT -- IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE THAT WE PROJECT -- FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE THE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT FEES WE PLAN TO COLLECT THAT YEAR. WE HAVE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SOMETHING MILLION DOLLARS INTO YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY IN THE BANK SO -- DO IT WITHOUT THIS LANGUAGE WITHOUT ANY OTHER US STATUTORY CHANGE WE WOULD REPAY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN AND THEN PAY THAT AMOUNT TO THE TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVICE ACCOUNT -- THE TOTAL PROJECTED THAT FOR NEXT YEAR WOULD THEN USE UP THE THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF THAT MONEY. SO BUT LOWER PRESENT TO DO HERE IS IN ORDER TO GET ALL SPECIAL FUND -- LOANS TO THE GENERAL FUND OFF THE BOOKS AT THE SAME TIME SO OUTSIDE OF TRANSPORTATION AND WITHIN TRANSPORTATION IS TO REPAY EVERYTHING -- WE'RE GONNA THREE PAY THAT MONEY THIS YEAR NEXT ANYWAYS IF WE HAVE THE MONEY THIS YEAR REPAY IT THIS YEAR AND THEN AS THE BUYERS AT A SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOU'RE A LIMB YOU'RE TRYING TO REDUCE ELIMINATE THE GENERAL FUND LIABILITIES BUT THE THE TRAFFIC AND THAT -- WAIT FEE LIABILITIES STILL EXIST WEEK YOU LIABILITIES CONTINUE TO AND SO OVER TIME AS THOSE WITHIN PROPOSE IS THAT IF THOSE AS THOSE LOANS ARE PAID OFF AND THE WEIGHT FEES WITH AND GO BACK TO TRANSPORTATION AFTER THAT. EVERYTHING IS PAID OFF IN. TWENTY THIRTY SIX THREE TWENTY THREE SEVEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- THERE'S THERE'S NO OTHER -- CALL IN THE WEIGHT FEES THAN THE TRANSITION THAT SERVICE SO AS TRANSPORTATION A SERVICE GOES DOWN IN THE LONG TERM THAN THOSE WAIT HE'S A RIB WHO WOULD BE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE USED FOR THAT AND TO BE USED -- FOR OTHER TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. STATUTORILY REQUIRED TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. OKAY I UNDERSTAND SO. SO WHY WOULD WE JUST PAY OFF WITH A WITH A GOOD MEASURE SHOULD BE OPENED AND PAYING OFF THE TRUCK WAIT FEES THAT THAT THAT WOULD OR THE LOANS. THE LIABILITIES IN THE WEIGHT FEES WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO THAT WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO USE TRUCK WAVY MONEY SOONER CORRECT TRANSPORTATION WILL BEGIN THESE A LONG TERM -- DEBT DEBT -- LIABILITIES FROM FROM THE BOND SO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A PAYMENT SCHEDULE THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN SOLD FOR FOR MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOU KNOW THE STATE'S Q. HAS A PORTFOLIO. THAT THEY MANAGE -- FOR FOR ALL OF THEIR DEBT SO YOU KNOW WE MANAGE THAT FOR FULLY ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS WE DON'T SELL BONDS UNTIL PROJECTS ARE READY -- I GOT SO SO THAT THAT PORTFOLIOS MANAGED THROUGH THE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY GROUP AND THROUGH THE THE STATE'S -- CASH MANAGEMENT. AND YOU KNOW SO I THEY THEY MANAGE THAT TO IT TOO IT'S ESSENTIALLY PAY AS LITTLE INTEREST AND GET AS MUCH PRINCIPLES POSSIBLE A THANK YOU THAT'S PATTERSON. CAN I I'D LIKE A LITTLE CLARIFICATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. FOR FOR DEBT ENOUGH AT IT SO IT'S BEEN COMPLICATED I'VE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS FOR A LONG TIME. HAVE TRUCK FEE. WAIT WAIT FEES HAVE. A GAS TAX FEES -- BEN UTILIZED. TO PAY OFF THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL DEBT. MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S A GENERAL OBLIGATION. BOND IS THAT RIGHT AND ARE WE IN SOME WAY. EITHER MINGLING FUNDS OR IN SOME WAY USING FEES. FOR ONE THING TO PAY OFF SOMETHING ELSE PROPOSITION ONE A IS A IS AN ELIGIBLE USE FOR THE FOR THE TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVICE COUNT SO THOSE THOSE FUNDS FOR A A PORTION OF PROPOSITION ONE A DEBT. IS IS PART OF THAT EQUATION YES. SO THERE'S PROP ONE BE PROP ONE A PROPOSITION ONE NINETY TWO AND PROPOSITION ONE AWAIT. ARE ALL ELIGIBLE. STATUTORILY TO BE PAID -- TO HAVE THEIR INTEREST PAID OUT OF THE TRANCE FISH THAT SERVICE ACCOUNT. IS YOUR ANSWER NO THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BONDS ARE USERS YES YES THOSE ARE AN ELIGIBLE USE FOR SUCH FOR THE ELDERLY. TO HAVE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND BEING PAID OFF WITH FEES AND TAXES. WE HAVE WAIT FEES BEING USED TO PAY OFF TO BEING BEING TRANSFER THE TRANSITION THAT SERVICE ACCOUNT FOR THOSE FOR SPECIFIC BONDS. THANK YOU -- THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. PUBLIC COMMENT ON I FROM USE -- ISSUES [inaudible] FOR FIVE ACCORDING. THE WIZARD FAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STEVE BAKER WITH THEIR NEW DISSOCIATES HERE. TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR REGARDING PROJECT INITIATION DOCUMENTS. PEGS OPPOSED TO THE PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF OUTSOURCING OF THE PIT DOCUMENTS -- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS IT IS THE INITIATION OF A NEW PROJECT WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CONTRACT OUT. ANY OF THAT WORK -- IMAGINE IF YOU'RE DOING IN ADDITION ON YOUR HOUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING. TO OUTSOURCE THE DECISION ON WHETHER YOU NEED TO PUT AN ADDITION ONTO YOUR OWN HOUSE. YOU MIGHT OUTSOURCE -- SOME OF THE DESIGN WORK LATER AFTER YOU'VE MADE THAT DECISION BUT THE SIZE OF A LANE WHERE IT'S GOING. THOSE ARE DECISIONS THAT. GOVERNMENT IN CALTRANS WHO NEED TO MAKE BASED ON THE TRAFFIC SURVEYS IN THE INPUT THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE LOCALS WE ALSO NOTE THE PEG. WENT ALONG LAST YEAR WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUTSOURCING IN GENERAL TO ACCOMMODATE THE SB ONE DOLLARS. NOW THAT THOSE MONIES ARE COMING IN WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REVERT BACK AND NOT OUTSOURCE THOSE PROJECT INITIATION DOCUMENT. AND THEN FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE COST OF OUTSOURCING THIS WORK A COST OF AT LEAST DOUBLE THE COST OF HAVING A STATE ENGINEER DO THAT WORK. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR KEEPING THIS ISSUE OPEN AND WE HOPE THAT AS THE BUDGET GETS CLOSED OUT. THIS CAN BE RESOLVED IN A WAY SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING THOSE INCREASED COSTS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARC WATTS ON BEHALF OF TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. ORIGINALLY CAME HERE JUST -- TO GENERALLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL ON THE PADS -- IT'S GENERICALLY I THINK A GOOD IDEA -- TO MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FINANCING FOR THE PITS OVER TIME CONSISTENT WITH A THE NEW SP ONE ENHANCE PROGRAM. SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO ENDORSE HAPPEN I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD ON AFTER THAT COMMENTARY YOU JUST HEARD THAT. THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD REASON TO LOOK AT A ANNIE CONTRACTING AT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF INCREASE OVER LIKE THAT. OF ANOTHER 5% BECAUSE IT GIVES A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE DEPARTMENT IF WE CAN END UP WITH SAVINGS. IN THE PROGRAM OR WE END UP WITH -- A COMPLEX PROJECT. THERE NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH BY DIFFERENT DISTRICT. THE ABILITY TO USE ANY CONTRACTING IS -- PROVIDES THAT MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY SO JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOU PREPARE -- TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- IS BERMAN COULD YOU -- CLARIFY -- BASED ON THE A COMMENT THAT WE HEARD. WHAT THE INTENDED -- OUT EIGHT USES FOR THE OUT SOURCING SURE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S THE DECISION MAKING IS GOING TO BE RETAINED THE DECISION A I'LL BE RETAINED WITH CALTRANS THE ENGINEERING THE DESIGN. A LOT OF THAT WILL BE DONE BY THE CONSULTANTS -- TYPICALLY WE HAVE 10% ON THE CAPITAL SIDE WERE ASKING FOR THE FLEXIBILITY TO GO FROM 5210% ON THE PIT SIDE. WITH THE SB ONE DOLLARS WE NEED -- TO CONTINUE. TO PRODUCES PIDS -- AND THESE ARE FLEXIBLE RESOURCES SO -- WE CAN SHIP THEM MORE EASILY BETWEEN DISTRICTS. WE DON'T NEED IT ALL WE DON'T HAVE IT ALL BUT IT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE TO RAMP UP. ALL OF THE WORK AND DELIVER THE SB ONE PROGRAM. ONE OTHER COMMENT -- IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PAID WORK -- THE CONSULTANTS TO A PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION AS IT RELATES TO THE COMPLETION OF THE PAD -- BUT THE ENTIRE PAID IS NOT DONE BY THE CONSULTANT -- CALTRANS STAFF -- ARE ULTIMATELY A STILL INVOLVED IN -- THE COMPLETION AND PRESENTATION OF THE PATH. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU -- WILL HOLD THIS -- OPEN -- AS WELL AS ISSUE FIVE TWO WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONSIDER -- THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OF OUTSOURCING -- IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU'VE PROPOSED. IN THE WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES OUR A CALTRANS OVERSIGHT FOR TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- NEXT UP WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. FOR ISSUES SIX AND SEVEN ALSO -- ABOVE HOLD OPEN ITEMS WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF ISSUE. SEVEN THANK. GOOD MORNING YOU HAD A A FULL DAY OF OF QUESTIONS YESTERDAY -- AND TO COME BACK -- TO LED TO THE CAPITAL FOR A OF ARE AT A TWO ISSUES HERE TODAY WILL START WITH THE MOTOR VEHICLE -- ACCOUNT FUND CONDITION IF YOU COULD TO OF PLEASE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW MISKITO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT -- THE NBA IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY A VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES AND DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATION FEES RESULTING IN ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE -- THE ACCOUNT PRIMARILY SUPPORT CH P. AND DMV STATE OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES OF HIS PROPOSED TWO POINT THREE BILLION FOR C. H. P. ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR DMV. AND FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION AND AIR BE ANOTHER CLASS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN ROUGHLY EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES -- HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM THE NVA TO THE GENERAL FUND EACH YEAR. THESE ARE FEES ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION AND GENERATED BY DOCUMENT SALES AND OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY DMV. AS SUCH THEY ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND WERE THEREFORE ELIGIBLE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND. AS SEEN ON PAGE TWENTY NINE IN THE AGENDA. THE NBA WAS PROJECTED TO BECOME INSOLVENT AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AS PART OF THE JANUARY TENTH -- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. IN ORDER TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT SOLVENT AND FUND THE CURRENT BCP APRIL ONE PC P. REQUESTS THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES. TO ONE SUSPEND THAT GENERAL FUND TRANSFER I MENTION FOR FIVE YEARS WHICH WILL ADD FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND AVAILABLE CASH -- OVER THAT TIME PERIOD [inaudible] TO DELAY. OF THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN REQUIRED BY SB EIGHTY FOUR UNLESS THE SUBLIMINAL PENSION PAYMENT -- STARTING IN CURRENT YEAR WHICH WILL ADD THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN AVAILABLE CASH -- FOR FIVE YEARS. THREE WILL SHIFT THE CHP OFFICE REPLACEMENTS TO THE PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND. AND SUSPEND FIVE CHP OFFICE REPLACEMENTS FIVE DMV OFFICE PROJECTS AND BOTH DEPARTMENTS STATEWIDE PLANNING AND CITED INVOCATION EFFORTS. THESE IF THE EFFORTS WILL KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT WITH AT LEAST A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE -- DROPPING THAT FLOW TO DRIVE TO AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY BELIEVES THAT. A 5% RESERVE -- IS PRUDENT FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES -- THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT A ONE MONTH RESERVE -- REVENUES TO EXPENDITURES -- HOWEVER IN ORDER TO PROPERLY BALANCE EXPENDITURES AGAINST REVENUE -- 3% WAS CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE -- IN THE SHORT TERM. GIVEN OUR APRIL ONE PROPOSALS -- THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPLIED. UPDATED EXPENDITURES WHICH YOU SEE IN THE AGENDA. BUT THE FUN CONDITION DOES NOT INCLUDE UPDATED REVENUES. THOSE WILL BE UPDATED AS PART OF THE REVISION PROCESS. THANK YOU SO -- WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION BASS SETS UP A OPINION ON THAT A RESERVE A 5% THAT -- EQUATES TO ONE MONTH THE OF REVENUE IS. APPROPRIATE OR BEST PRACTICE. WELL HISTORICALLY THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT WE ASSUME FOR EVERY FUND -- BUT ESPECIALLY THIS ONE WITH THIS MUCH. REVENUE AND AS MANY EXPENDITURES AS OCCUR -- I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS -- WHY IS THAT CONCERT ACT ARE YOU STATING THAT THE -- ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THAT INTO THE THE BEST PRACTICE -- FOR A RESERVE AND IF SO. WHAT IS THAT CONCLUSION BASED ON? THAT -- A STANDARD AMONGST ALL STATES -- AND WE'RE WE'RE SECOND. FOR WELL IT AWAY MAN. THE MAN ABOUT DEPARTMENT FINDS. THAT IT'S JUST BEEN A HISTORIC LEVEL -- ACROSS SPECIAL FUNDS HISTORICALLY 5% RESERVE WAS CONSIDER PUTTING A BURDEN RESERVE. TYPICALLY THAT OR KLAY OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A AN IDEA WHETHER. SINCE I'VE BEEN AT FINANCE FIFTEEN YEARS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE I I'M AFRAID SO YES -- NOW. HISTORICALLY THE DMV IN THE C. H. P. WHO ARE THE PRIMARY USE OF OF THE NBA HAVE MANAGED. WHEN IT'S GOTTEN AS LOW AS A HUNDRED MILLION? BELOW THAT WE WOULD FOR NOT TO GO AGAIN FOR CASH REASONS -- I KNOW THE GENOCIDE IDEALLY WE SET HUNDRED IDEALLY WE DON'T WANNA GO BELOW THAT FOR CASH REASONS BUT OF OF MORE PRUDENT RESERVE WOULD BE ON THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR -- TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL SIMPLY FOR MANAGING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S FLOWING IN AND OUT PAYING SALARIES ETCETERA. OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE THE GOLD TO A YOU THINK WE WANT TO ACHIEVE -- AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS THAT KIND OF PATCHWORK OF OF FIXES THAT ARE RELATIVELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE I THINK THE FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. YES THE V. I. V. IDEAS TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE BAD. THE REAL ID SPIKE WHICH IS WHICH AND OUR PROPOSAL WOULD -- REQUIRE SOME. I'M USUAL. INCREASES IN EXPENDITURES AND SO YES THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET. OFFSET THOSE IN THE SHORT TERM THAT MAKES SENSE BUT WHAT -- OTHER THAN A REAL ID BEING RESULTS THAT'S NOT REALLY A LONG TERM FIX SO WHAT -- PROPOSALS WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE MAKING. TO ADDRESS THIS ON A PERMANENT PERMANENT OR LONG TERM BASIS. WELL AS YOU CAN SEE NOTHING IN A STATEMENT WE DO DROP DOWN BUT THEN WE DO START TO GO BACK UP AS YOU KNOW. THE VARIOUS FEES HAVE CPI INDEXED FOR INFLATION SO -- THEY WOULD. WHAT WE GO DOWN BUT THEN WE THAT REVENUES KICK UP ENOUGH? TO HELP BRING IT BACK UP OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A FUND THAT WE ALL MONITOR VERY CLOSELY. I'M A WE WOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES TO SEE IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW. THREE FOUR YEARS OUT -- IF ADDITIONAL ACTIONS ARE NEEDED SO -- WAIT AND SEE. SOUNDS LIKE THE AT THE MOMENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S I MEAN BASED ON ON WHAT WE HAVE BEST ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW WHAT THE MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED. KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THE THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- BY MEMBERS -- THAT WE APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF CHP OFFICERS A IN THE STATE -- WHAT WOULD A PATHWAY BE -- OF FOR PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THAT. WELL I KNOW THERE WAS OF A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS VETOED THAT PROPOSED ADDING TWO HUNDRED OFFICERS A YEAR UP TO SIX HUNDRED WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION ONGOING -- WHICH ARE GIVEN THE CURRENT. EXPENDITURES THE FINE COULD NOT SUPPORT. ROM SO AND I'M ASKING IF FOR A THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVEN SOME CONSIDERATION -- TO ACCOMMODATING THAT SINCE IT WAS A BILL AND TO MAY BE UNDER CONSIDERATION AGAIN THIS YEAR IN THE FUTURE. WE WOULD HAVE TO BALANCE THE EXPENDITURES OUT OF THE NBA ALTERNATIVE FUNDS SOURCES REVENUE CHANGES IT WOULD BE A QUITE A BROAD -- BRIDE DISPLAY OF ITEMS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IN ORDER IF IF WE ARE TO CONTINUE FUNDING -- INCREASED OFFICERS OUT OF THE NBA OKAY WELL -- THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND SO WE CAN DO SOME CONSIDERATION OF THAT QUESTION -- BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT TIME THAT -- THE COMMITTEE OF ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE TO DO ONE AT SOMETHING SURE ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM THE LESSEE BALANCE OFFICE JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. THE FIRST IS IN TERMS OF THAT. MAGNITUDE OF THE NEEDFOR DIFFERENT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS SORT OF THE CONDITION OF NVA REALLY STARTS WITH THE LEDGES PARTIES FOR EXPENDITURES DO YOU PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE MAYBE AS A GOVERNOR YOU MAY WANT. TO PROVIDE A HIGHER. LEVEL DEPENDING OTHER YOUR OTHER PARTIES ARE YOU MAY WANT TO PROVIDE A LESS LEVEL LOOK MUCH OF THAT. COVERS WAS FUNDING INCREASE FROM EXPENSES FROM THE NBA DEALS WITH SORT OF THE DMV DMV RELATED ISSUES REGARDING THE WAIT TIME NEVER PLACED REAL ID YOU MAY DECIDE YOU DON'T WANT TO FULLY FUND THOSE THERE. THEN THEN THE ACTIONS NEEDED TO KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT ARE ARE THE SECOND THING I THOUGHT WAS REALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF SORT OF THE THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN HAVING SOME ONGOING CHALLENGES PERIODICALLY FOR LAST FOR MANY YEARS SO YOU KINDA WANT TO THINK SORT OF THE RIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR POSES SO THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF SOME THESE PROPOSALS. THE FIRST ONE I TALK ABOUT IS THE GOV SUPPOSE OF SUSPEND THIS TRANSFER FROM THE NBA TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT'S CURRENTLY ABOUT NINETY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE USUALLY DID IT THE LECTURE TOOK TOOK THE INITIATIVE AND THAT IS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION THESE ARE FEES THAT ARE VERY AS MISCELLANEOUS FEES THAT THAT THE Vì COLLECTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED BY THE CONSTITUTION UNLIKE THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES OR DRIVER'S LICENSE FEES. IN FACT LATER DID IT MICHELLE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS WE NEED IS THE DATA TRANSFER ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR ONE YEAR. THEN BECAUSE OF HIS CONDITION WE NEED FOR ANOTHER YEAR. AND THEN PRIME MINISTRATION JUST ASSUME IN THE BUDGET THAT IT WAS JUST AS AUTOMATIC TRANSFER. I'M GIVEN THE CONDITION OF ENVY EIGHT GIVEN SOME OF THESE ONGOING CHALLENGES A OF THE NBA THAT IT WAS THIS INTENDED THESE ARE TEMPORARY YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER JUST. A LIMITING THE TRANSFER ONGOING BATES IS NOT JUST FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE YOU KINDA WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE FUND BEYOND ADMINISTRATION FORECAST OF THE FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL COST PRICES WHETHER IT'S INCREASE COSTS FOR C. H. P. OFFICERS. THE DEPARTMENT OR VEHICLES HAS WANTS TO UNDERTAKE VERY IF IT PROJECTS THOSE ARE GONNA ABOUT YOUR COSTS BEYOND THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. ON THE SECOND OPPOSE I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON IS THIS POSE THAT THE PART OF FINANCE MANAGER REGARDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS -- REGARDING A ALONE THAT WAS MADE FROM THE STATE'S ON CASH BALANCE TO THE CALPERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. THE MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO SUSPEND ANY OF THOSE ANNUAL PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AS THEY MENTION A LARGE OF IT IS A LOT A LARGE PART OF THEIR PROPOSES TO SORT OF ACCOMMODATE THE THING CHRIS COLFER RELAYED THE THAT MAY MAKE SENSE BUT YOU'RE REALLY PUSHING IN THE OUT YEARS WERE THOSE PAYMENTS ARE CAN BE MUCH HIGHER. WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS BY THE END OF BY JUNE THIRTIETH -- TWENTY THIRTY AND THERE'S GONNA BE ADDITIONAL COSTS NOW YOU'RE SO ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT IS. YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT ADJUSTING THE PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS MAYBE MAKING LESS PAYMENTS THAN OTHERWISE WOULD BEEN MADE AN INCREASING SOMEBODY OUT YEARS RATHER THAN JUST SUSPENDING THE MALL FOR THE FIVE YEARS SO. ARE VICE YOU IS THERE ARE SOME THOUGHT THIS IS REGARDING THE ACCOUNT BUT YOU WANT TO THINK LONG TERM AND NOT JUST SORT OF PATCH IT UP AND PUSH IT DOWN THE LINE. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THAT CONTEXT MR MULLIN DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION MIGHT AGES GET ADDITIONAL REACTION FROM DO F. TO WHAT. YOU JUST HEARD [inaudible] CERTAINLY -- IT OUT IN REGARDS TO THE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS -- IT COMES BACK TO WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVE IS EVERYBODY COMFORTABLE WITH -- LAST YEAR -- THERE WERE SOME PROPOSALS THAT OUT. TO FIND CAP SOME CAPITAL IT ALLEY PROJECTS -- WITH THE A PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND AS WE HAVE THIS YEAR AND THE DIRECTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION RECEIVE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME WAS WE DON'T WANT TO GO BELOW A HUNDRED MILLION. AND SO ACTIONS WERE TAKEN I WOULD BELIEVE WE WOULD BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION HERE THAT -- IN IN OUR CURRENT CONDITION WE GO TO ONE FIFTY FIVE IF THE LEGISLATURE SAYS WE ARE COMFORTABLE GOING TWO HUNDRED MILLION WE WANT TO USE THAT FIFTY FIVE MILLION. TO CSUS YET PAY SOMETHING ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION -- THE MINISTRATIONS OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT THAT COMFORTABLE LEVEL IS THIS VOTE. I'D JUST A PIGGY BACK ON THAT CERTAINLY A I THINK I SHARE THE CONCERN OF A MISTER MULLIN MISTER BLUE ABOUT TRYING TO BUT BEING CONCERNED ABOUT. DOING SOME BANDAID SAVINGS NOW AND THEN BALLOONING THE COSTS IN THE FUTURE. ON THE ON THE SPECIFIC -- SHIFT AWAY FROM A PAY AS YOU GO TO A MORE LEASE BOND -- OPTION WOULD THAT WITH THE LA -- AGREE THAT THAT CONCERNS REMAINS TO THAT WERE INSTEAD OF PAYING AS YOU GO THE THE FIXING THINGS THAT IF WE GO TO A BOND. MECHANISM THAT WE PAY INTEREST AND WE BLOOM THE COSTS IN THE FUTURE. YES BECAUSE I MEAN TRADITIONALLY BOTH FOR DMV'S EACH PAY WE FIND THE FACILITIES ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS -- DOING BONTA FINANCING ISN'T. UNCOMMON IN WHATWE DO A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDINGS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES SORT OF PUSH THE PAYMENTS OUT AND DOES INCREASE COST ON THOSE INTERESTS THE OTHER THING ABOUT OF CITIES I KNOW IT IS. ROSS OF THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G IN PUSHING&lt;/c&gt; BACK A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT RIDE IN FINDING THAT THE NEW DELAY GINGER ADMINISTRATION HAD AGREED TO PLAN AND OUR PERSON THOSE BACK THOSE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE COSTS IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL. SO YOU'RE RIGHT FINANCING ON FINANCE BASES DOES INCREASE THE INTEREST SAID THEN IT AT THAT POINT -- WE RISKING. TRYING TO KEEP IT SOLVENT NOW AND THEN MAKING IT INSOLVENT LATER. LOUISE PUSH WHICH IS PUSHING THAT WORK WHAT IS PUSHING IT OUT RIGHT WITH OUR PROBLEMS ARE REALLY FIX THEY WERE JUST. WHICH WE WHAT WE'VE SORT OF BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO ARE THERE BUT THE FROM THE LA A PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE THERE MORE -- STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO TO TO TO THE NBA THAT. THAT MAKES IT MORE SOLVENT AND ARE THERE ARE THINGS THAT NOT BEING CONSIDERED HERE -- THE MORE LUXURY WE WE THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING EXPLORED MUCH IN DETAIL BESIDES THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN FOR NOW ABOUT SORT OF INCREASING REVENUES SO FORTH IS. TAKEN THE CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER EXPENDITURES FROM THE NBA IN ADDITION THE AMBIANCE IS P. WE GIVE MONEY TO AIR RESOURCES BOARD. FORD TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS FROM VEHICLE EMISSIONS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER FUN SOURCES THAT THEY ARE BE HAS THAT THOSE COULD BE FUNDED FOR I KNOW THEY HAVE SOME SPECIAL FUNDS AT THAT ALSO HAVE SOME. ISSUESAS WELL BUT THERE COULD BE SOME THAT. ME MAYBE TO FIND AN ALTERNATE FUNDING SOURCE THAT WOULD FREE UP MOTOR VEHICLE OUT FUNDS THAT COULD FIND OTHER EXPENDITURES SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK INTO MORE. FORTY OKAY THIS DOES BY A FINANCE HAVE A RESPONSE OR AT THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THIS. SURE THANK YOU FAMILY MEMBER FONG RANDY CATS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT COSTS MORE THAN CASTS ITS. BUT WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION IT'S MAYBE ABOUT 20% MORE -- HOWEVER IT DOES ALLOW PROJECTS ON A MANY AND ALL TENDER BEING SUSPENDED WERE CONSIDERED CRITICAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. ALLOW THEM TO BE COMPLETED IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER HANNAH CASH CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT -- WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON APPROACH STATEWIDE A CURRENTLY THERE'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX ACTIVE PROJECTS -- STATEWIDE THAT UTILIZE THE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION FUND -- FAMILY ALSO NOTE THAT. A WALL IT HAVE ON THAT THERE'S BEEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT UTILIZE IT THAT HISTORICALLY -- HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH FOR EXAMPLE DOES THE MILITARY INSTALLED AT HEADQUARTERS PROJECT WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME MILITARY UTILIZED A PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND THEN ALSO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONSOLIDATION PROJECT. IS ALREADY -- A A PROJECT FOR WHICH THE AND VA WOULD BE PAYING SOME THAT SERVICE. BUT A IN TERMS OF THE BUT YOU AYE AYE I GUESS MY MY BROADER POINT I GUESS OF TRYING TO GET THE PERSPECTIVE ON THE PART OF FINANCES. DO YOU SHARE THAT THE CONCERNED THAT WE ARE BASICALLY. BALLOONING COSTS IN THE FUTURE. AND FOR A SHORT TERM SAVINGS. YOU DISAGREED YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OR DO YOU TO YOU HAVE YOU SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS BUT YOU JUST. I THINK A LOT OF OF THAT I THINK A LOT OF IT AND I'M JUST SPEAKING ON THE CAP OUT LIKE. I'M SORRY AND I'M JUST SPEAKING ON THE CAP OUT LATE PARTS -- IS THAT. THERE IS SOME DID WHENEVER YOU DO BOND FINANCING IT WILL COST MORE BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS IF THESE PROJECTS ARE STALLED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE PROJECT STILL NEED TO BE COMPLETED AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE TO INCREASE THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE OUT YEARS VERSUS BEING ABLE TO START THE PROJECTS NOW -- A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S A DISCUSSION THAT IT'S JUST LOOK AT THE STREET CASH BASIS BUT A DOLLAR -- THAT DOLLARS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IS NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS A A DOLLAR TODAY. OKAY SO YOU AND I I THINK IN THE BROADER POINT IS IT'S NOT JUST THE THE THE LEAST BONDS IT'S IT'S COMBINED WITH THE MADE WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH A STRAW SO. THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT MR MULLIN BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE THE THE THE PENSION PAYMENTS EVERYTHING ELSE SO. HOLISTICALLY ME YOU MAY BE. YOU KNOW YOU MADE SAVE A LITTLE IN IN IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN. YOU KNOW TEN YEARS NOW WE NOW WE'VE GOT INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT WE GONNA DO ON THESE BONDS AND THEN WE'VE GOT. ADDITIONAL DEBT SERVICE ON ON PENSIONS AND THEN WE REAP WE'RE GONNA RELITIGATE WHAT WE DID THE WHATEVER THE PREVIOUS ISSUE ON THE TRUCK WAIT FEES WHERE YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE MOVING MONEY AROUND. AND THE WHERE IT WENT AND WE HAVEN'T MADE THE FUND ANYMORE SOLVENTS SO I THINK THAT'S I MEAN SO THAT'S I GUESS THE MY GENERAL CONCERNED THAT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU. TO I'M TRYING TO TEASE OUT FROM YOU IS THAT ARE THOSE IS THERE A TEN YEAR PLAN INSTEAD OF MORE A FIVE YEAR PLAN OR OR MAYBE WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A FIVE YEAR LEVEL. I I'VE I WILL NOTE -- AGAIN WHILE WE'RE DELAYING THE PENSION PAYMENTS. WE DO SEE THAT RESERVE BEGAN TO GROW EVEN THOUGH IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WERE MAKING A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT. SO. YOU KNOW IT. THERE'S ALSO. AM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT REVENUES MIGHT BE THEY MAY BE MUCH HIGHER -- I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. PROPOSED -- OF THIS YEAR A THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- GENERAL FUND PENSION PAYMENT -- TO CALPERS AND THAT PAYMENT -- SAVES THE NVA AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION OVER OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS -- SO THE THOSE -- PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMING OUT OF THE NBA. I WOULD JUST ADD ON WE WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ADDRESSING A SHORT TERM AND PUSHING SOME OF THESE OUT TO LONG TERM THE IN THE LONG TERM IT CAN'T IT CAN'T HANDLE IT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO MONITOR -- CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT AS YOU NOTED YOUNG EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS ARE YOU THINK THINGS THINGS DO CHANGE BUT AGAIN EVEN IN THAT LAST YEAR THE FUND CONDITION WHERE WE ADDED. XIN BACK IN -- THE FUND BOUNCE A STOCKBROKER RIGHT AND I CAN AND I APPRECIATE THAT I I'M JUST TRYING TO KIND OF GLEE MORE INFORMATION AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THREE BILLION DOLLAR DOWN PAYMENT. ATTHAT THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IT IT BUT THERE WERE WE'RE NOT MAKING ANOTHER PAYMENT AND SO WERE THE WERE LOW IN THE COST AND ONE AND AND THEY WERE INCREASING THE COST AND THE OTHER BECAUSE WE'VE W'VE STOPPED MAKING A PAYMENT ON SOMETHING ELSE. SO I THINK FROM FOR JUST AND AS IT MYSELF AND I DON'T KNOW I WAS THE FOR THE FULL COMMITTEE IS THAT A MAYBE WE HAD A MORE LONGER TERM -- PLAN -- IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO THANK YOU. MS REST FALL BY MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM THIS DISCUSSION THAT THERE ARE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS HERE. THAT WE'RE STILL PLEASE THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS -- I APPRECIATED FROM THE ALEJO'S COMMENTS ON PAGE. THIRTY TWO OF TALKING ABOUT THE TO EVALUATIONS THAT ARE BEING THAT BEING UNDERTAKEN OUT OF PARTNER FINANCING GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. AGENCY. BUT ALSO TO CONSIDER DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT AGENCY TO SUBMIT A REPORT. AT SPRING BUDGET A POTENTIALLY FISSION SEES. IS THE DEPARTMENT PREPARED TO DO THAT [inaudible] YEAH THAT'S I WILL SPEK TO THAT FROM A THE KATHY WHITE ACTING DIRECTOR OF DMV SO WITH REGARDS. TO PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BUSINESS RE ENGINEERING COST SAVINGS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DMV HAS EMBRACED BUT I ALSO TELL YOU THERE'S A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOK AT GAINING EFFICIENCIES AND HOW WE RUN OUR OPERATIONS. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU -- BASED ON MY SHORT TENURE AT DMV -- THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DO THIS VERY MANUALLY ORIENTED THAT IF WE ACTUALLY LEVERAGE BETTER TECHNOLOGY. AND LOOKED AT WAYS TO AUTOMATE WHICH ACTUALLY GAIN A LOT OF EFFICIENCIES THERE SO DMV IS RIGHT -- AND WE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES -- ACTION ACTIVITY THINGS THAT WE CAN MEASURE FROM A KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR -- WHAT'S THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT BACK TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN WE ACTUALLY GAIN THOSE EFFICIENCIES CAN WE PROCESS THINGS MORE QUICKLY THAN WE CURRENTLY DO. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I WILL TELL YOU THERE HAS TO BE AN UP FRONT INVESTMENT. TO ACHIEVE THAT STATE TO THEN ALSO GAIN THE EFFICIENCIES SO I THINK. GOING BACK TO WHAT THE LA ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THERE'S SOME IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM NEEDS. BUT I KNOW FROM A DMV STANDPOINT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE AGENCY WE ARE COMMITTED TO ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE DMV CAN BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS IN A MORE EFFICIENT. AND EFFECTIVE WAY AND AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT I AM FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW. I ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA LEAN ACADEMY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HI. I BELIEVE IN PROCESS PREVENT ITS EVERY FIBER OF HOW I GO INTO AN ORGANIZATION OPERATE. AND IF I AM ALLOWED TO DO THAT DMV WE WILL BRING THAT TO DMV. BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME WITH EVERY PRODUCT LINE I NEED TO GO IN THERE AND SEE WHERE THE EFFICIENCIES ARE THAT WE CAN GAIN FOR ALL OF THOSE PRODUCT LINES. YOU SAY IF YOU'RE ALLOWED. TO IS THERE AN ISSUE ABOUT THAT WELL I'M CURRENTLY IN AN ACTING ROLE IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND SO THAT THAT'S ALWAYS DEPENDENT ON WHERE THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO GO AS WELL AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE. CORRECT. I THINK THAT THE KNOWING THE DMV HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS FOR SO LONG I THINK THAT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING ALREADY. IN PLACE. IT'S JUST AS MR FUNG'S TALKED ABOUT NOT JUST A FIVE YEAR PLAN BUT A TEN YEAR PLAN. THIS HAS TO BE PART OF A DEPARTMENT WITH SUCH STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. IF WE CONTINUE THE WHERE WE'RE GOING. WITHOUT THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT. WE CAN'T CONTINUE PERIOD. SO -- IT. I GUESS IT'S SORT OF SURPRISES ME THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HERE AND WE'RE THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING -- SO THAT TEN YEAR PLAN. RATHER THAN A FIVE YEAR PLAN IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND I HOPE THAT SUCH A REPORT AS WELL AS RECOMMENDED BY THE LA -- IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOOKED AT WILL BE PREPARED SO THAT WE CAN. AB -- SO WHEN WE EVALUATE WE HAVE SOMETHING TO BASE IT ON AND I THINK THAT THOSE OF YOU ON THE INSIDE WOULD BETTER KNOW WHERE THE EFFICIENCIES. AND INEFFICIENCIES ARE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DEFICITS THAT WE DO HAVE. THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON [inaudible] YES -- AGAIN. I WANT TO FOCUS ON APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS. AND THE STRUCTURAL [inaudible] DEFICIT. IT REALLY CONCERNS ME THAT WE HAVE A FUND THAT. I SUPPOSE ORIGINALLY STARTED TO FIND DMV. AND C. H. P. AND YET WE HAVE. LOADED UP ON THIS BOND A LOT OF EXPENDITURES. MY QUESTION IS WHAT WITH THIS FUN LOOK LIKE IF WE ZEROED OUT ALL OF THE OTHER. USES OF THOSE PLANS EXCEPT FOR THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE C. H. P. IN THE DMV. AS NOTED IN A GENDER -- JUST CURRENTLY THAT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WOULD WOULD ELIMINATE THE SUPPORT FOR A R. B. AND I BELIEVE IT'S SIX THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN OTHER. DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVE SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE. WE GET WHAT DOES THAT DO WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RESERVES THAT DO THAT. EASILY. WHAT WHAT WOULD IF IF YOU'RE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL ME THAT'S USABLE MONEY FOR THE C. H. P. N. DMV? I WAS A DEMONSTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE AND BE FUNDING FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS BUT IF. IF YOU WERE TO DO DO YOU FIND ALL OF THOSE OTHER DEPARTMENTS FROM THE NBA THE BALANCE IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WOULD GO UP BY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE UNWILLINGNESS TO DO THAT. LEADS TO THE INEVITABLE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT WE HAVE IN MY JUDGMENT. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I FEAR THIS INEVITABLY LEADS MORE FEES. ON REGISTRATION. HIGHER FEES TO PEOPLE WHO USE THE DMV. AND SO THE THE DOUBLE THE LAST. FOR THE FIRST RESORT FOR THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE FIXES. ALWAYS GOES BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I JUST WANNA KNOW YOUR OPINION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS DOWN THE ROAD AND INTENTION. TO CLOSE THIS STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. BY FEE INCREASES. FROM THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE DMV. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT INCREASE. FEES AND GETS US THROUGH -- THAT THE THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL IS NOT TO INCREASE FEES AND A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. OKAY BUT THAT STILLDOES NOT ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YOU COULD BE FUNDING MUCH MORE DMV ACTIVITY MUCH MORE C. H. P. ACTIVITY IF YOU'RE ZEROED OUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMING OUT OF THIS BOUNCE. AND THAT'S NOT BEING PROPOSED. AGAIN. TO ME THIS FEELS LIKE. BUDGET TRICKERY IT FEELS LIKE -- SHELL GAME. ARE WE HAVE A FUND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEET PAIRS OF CALIFORNIA TO THE DMV. TO DO A VERY APPROPRIATE THINGS. THE DMV CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. OVER TIME WE ADD UP AND ADD UP MORE AND MORE DRAW DOWN. FOR PURPOSES THAT ARE UTTERLY UNRELATED TO THE FEES THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OR PAY. I JUST THINK IT ADDS INEVITABLY IF WE DON'T MAKE SUBSTANTIAL -- CUTS AND WHAT ALL THIS DISCRETIONARY STUFF. WE'RE GONNA END UP I THINK WITH THE INCREASES IN FRONT OF US. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT I WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S TOO EASY TO GO TO THE FEE PAIRS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FIX STUFF LIKE THIS [inaudible] MS RIVER [inaudible] I'M. I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT ON POTENTIAL FEE INCREASES I KNOW YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION BUT I KNOW ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE FROM THE LA -- WAS TO TEACH TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES BY INCREASING -- VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND OTHER FEES -- YOU KNOW I HAVE CONCERNS WITH HOW THAT IMPACTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- ESPECIALLY AFTER WE JUST RAISED FEES THROUGH SB ONE ON REGISTRATION FEES -- SO I I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS IS OUR LAST RESORT IN TERMS OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE DON'T INCREASE FEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE TELLER COMMENTS NOT A QUESTION UNLESS YOU FEEL LIKE IT AFTER RESPOND. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A FROM FROM DALLAS OFFICE I WILL WITHIN YOUR AGENDA IN OUR REPORT WORK SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SORT OF ONE OF THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR LATER SO WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING. A INCREASE IN A VEHICLE REGISTERED WHAT WE TRY TO LAY ON ARE NOW SAYS WHAT WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT LEVERS YOU COULD PLAY WITH TO ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE. GREAT WELL THANK YOU I THINK THAT'LL CONCLUDE THIS -- ISSUE AND WE HAVE -- ISSUE SEVEN REMAINING AND WE'LL DO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THAT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN I'M KATHLEEN WEB ACTING DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OR VEHICLES AND WITH ME IS ROBBIE CROCKETT DIPPY DIRECTOR OF MINISTRIES SERVICES.

ALL OF ISSUE NINE OPEN -- SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ATTEND TO THE BUSINESS THAT THEY NEED TO ATTEND TO ON THIS BUSY DAY. SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION A OKAY THE FIRST REQUEST IS FOR THE WALNUT CREEK FIELD OFFICE RELOCATION THE CURRENT FIELD OFFICE IS THE LEAST DISABILITY THAT IS CHANGED OWNERSHIP. AND THE NEW OWNERS ARE NOT WILLING TO INCLUDE DMV IN THEIR FUTURE PLANS FOR THE SPACE THE CURRENT LEASE WAS SET TO EXPIRE. NOVEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND DG'S DTS WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A TWO YEAR LEASE EXTENSION WITH THE BUILDING OWNERS WHILE DMV LOOKS FOR A NEW LOCATION.

SIX AND SEVEN SEEING NONE -- MS WEBB THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR APPEARING HERE AFTER YOUR LONG DAY YESTERDAY JUST BEFORE YOU LEAVE I HAVE ONE QUICK COMMENT -- WITHOUT YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY -- REALLY I JUST WANTED TO REFLECT ON YOUR STATED INTENTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT TERMS OF REFORMING SYSTEMS AND BRINGING MORE EFFICIENCIES AND TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR THE MANY -- ISSUES THAT -- THAT EXISTED DMV -- I AM -- YOU KNOW. INTENT IN PROVIDING -- A HIGH LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD -- AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE CONFIRMED AT A ON A ON A PERMANENT BASIS BUT AT THE DEPARTMENT MOVES FORWARD. IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF REFORMS LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT -- I I I I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU TO PROVIDE US WITH BENCHMARKS -- AS I KNOW YOU'RE INTENDING TO DO AND WE'RE GONNA WANNA HOLD YOU TO THOSE BENCHMARKS IN. A PROVIDE YOU AS I THINK -- WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THEM BECAUSE I THINK -- THE OTHER PROBLEMS THE DEPARTMENT IS FACING OUR RESULT OF MULTI FACETED -- TO ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN ONE OF THOSE ISSUES AS OUR LACK OF PROVIDING PROPER FUNDING CUTS -- FOR THE MANY INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE ASKED THE DMB TO FALL OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND FROM YOU AND FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT WHAT THE ACTUAL NEEDS ARE -- SO THAT WE CAN -- EITHER PROVIDER NOT PROVIDE THE PROPER LEVEL OF FUNDING BUT IF WE DON'T DO THAT -- WE NEED TO BE HELD A CON ACCOUNTABLE ALSO IS THIS IS A BI LATERAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. SORRY I MISSED MOST OF THAT MEETING YESTERDAY SO I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO TO MAKE MY COMMENTS THAT. AND MISTER REED YOU ARE LATE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I AM IN CANNELLA SPEAK ANYWAY. THANK YOU I I WAS LOOKING AT THE WRONG PAGE. I WAS AGAIN THE COVER SHEET IS AT ISSUE SIX I SAID WELL THAT'S NOT AND THE HR TRUTH THAT I HAD NOT HEARD OF AN ISSUE EIGHT NINE ARE YOU. I'M HERE TO BE IN THE NBA. OKAY OKAY NBA ACCOUNT FLOOR IS YOUR BANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ERIN READ. REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HIGH WITH COMMON. OF I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING THEM FOR FORTY ONE YEARS SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE NBA COUNT. OVER ALL THOSE YEARS AND A MILLION AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT LITERALLY FOR ALMOST ALL THAT TIME -- IS IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S A WAY WHERE IT'S BEEN. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO STEP IN PERIODICALLY AND ADJUST THE FEES BECAUSE IT WAS A FLAT DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE STATUTE. SIR EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU HAD TO RAISE IT BY FIVE DOLLARS OR TEN DOLLARS -- SO FINDING JUST A FEW YEARS AGO YOU INDEX TO TO THE COLA BUT THAT'S RELATIVELY LOW INFLATION IS LIKE TWO TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. A AND THAT DOESN'T KEEP UP THE COST OF FUEL. I MEAN GET YOU WE KNOW HOW VOLATILE THAT IS AND IS HEADED TO FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON. FOR US I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT MAIS. LESS THAN THAT THE COST OF SALARIES ACOSTA RENT AND MORTGAGES AND PAYMENTS ON EVERYTHING THEY THEY OPERATE. WILL WILL NECESSITATE YOU TO HAVE TO DO ANOTHER. SOME DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE AND THE THE QUESTION IS WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT -- BUT YOU'LL BE FACED WITH THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO PATCH IT UP WITH. YOU KNOW. STOPPING THE LEAGUE FROM THE DMV MONEY THAT'S REYES OUT OF SELLING INFORMATION TO INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT SORT OF THING -- THAT MONEY SHOULD STAY IN THE NBA IN MY OPINION. BUT IT'S BEEN TAKEN FOR DECADES NOT JUST RECENTLY THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AS LONG AS I CAN RECALL -- SO I'M HERE TO SAY THAT THE CHP IS LEAN IS ANY DEPARTMENT YOU'LL REVIEW. I CHALLENGE ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT TO SHOW WHERE THEY HAVE FEWER EMPLOYEES AND THEY HAD TEN YEARS AGO. C. H. P. HAS EIGHTY THREE LESS OFFICERS TODAY AND HAD TEN YEARS AGO. THE POPULATION HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CARS ACCIDENTS THE MILEAGE DEATH RATE HAS INCREASED. THIS IS THE OFFICERS DOING SO MUCH MORE WITH A LOT LESS. BUT NO THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING THROUGH THAT -- THAT I AND I'VE LOOKED A LOT OF THEM AND MOST OF THEM HAVE HAD INCREASES. WE HAD THREE HUNDRED MORE OFFICERS AND WE HAVE TODAY. DURING THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION BUT THEY WERE CUT DURING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THEY WERE NEVER RESTORED. NEVER NOT. ONE SO WE'RE LESS OFFICERS TODAY AND TEN YEARS AGO SO I'M HERE TO SAY THAT THAT WE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT -- AGAIN THE MILEAGE DEATH RATE IS UP OF THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T SAY WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE THEY'RE BOUND. TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT I CAN TELL YOU FREELY THAT IS A PROBLEM AND THE OFFICERS ARE. REALLY STRESSED. WE JUST HAD AN OFFICER KILLED LAST SATURDAY PROBABLY NOBODY KNOWS BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE NEWSPAPERS BUT AS SERGEANT WAS RUN OVER AND KILLED. LAST SATURDAY THAT MAKES THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY NO OTHERLAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THIS STATE HAS THE DEATH RATE NEARLY AS HIGH. NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT THE CHP LOSSES ARE. SO I IMPLORE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN. HELP US RESOLVE THAT THE BILL LAST YEAR WAS VETOED THE VETO MESSAGE SIMPLY SAID DO IT IN THE BUDGET. THAT'S WHAT THE VETO MESSAGE SAID SO FINANCES NOT PROPOSING IT THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING IT SO I DON'T KNOW WHY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND WHAT DATA THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT. THE IT'S NOT WHAT I'M SEEING. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT WAS THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE FOR ME TO ASK -- MY QUESTION EARLIER IN THE IN THE MEETING. I APPRECIATED YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR LAST DEPARTMENT OF THE DAY THANK YOU FOR BEING SO. PATIENT WE'RE GONNA. HERE NOW FROM A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. TO HAVE ISSUES EIGHT AND NINE AND AGAIN WILL TAKE US SINCE BOTH OF THESE ARE HOLD OPEN -- WE WILL -- I HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF ISSUE NINE WELCOME SIR GERMAN WOMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMISSIONER WARNED STANLEY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING. AND SPEAK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET -- BEFORE I WANT TO I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU PERSONALLY AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR SUPPORT NOT POURING OF CONCERN. FOR SERGEANT STEVEN LIKE KHAN WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. ON SATURDAY APRIL SIXTH IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ON INTERSTATE. FIFTEEN VERY WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER. THAT HE SACRIFICE FOR ALL OF US AND HE WAS A HE WAS A GREAT MAN. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD WORK OF THE MEN AND WOMEN AND ITS C. H. B.. AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS GOOD STEWARDS OF THE FUNDING HAS PROVIDED US. ALSO WANT TO SUPPRESS MY THANKS TO YOUR STAFF THAT THIS HELPED US GET READY FOR THIS PROCESS. FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CAPITAL OUTLAY IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WE HAVE FIVE PROPOSALS ON DISCUSSION TODAY REGARDING CAPITAL OUTLAY. BECAUSE THE VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WE'RE PROPOSING THE SUSPENSION. OF THE FACILITY REPLACEMENT PROJECT FOR THE QUINCY AND THE SANTA ANNA AREA OFFICES. THIS WOULD RESULT IN REVERSION OF THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS BACK TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. FOR THE EL CENTRO HE WORKED AND SAN BERNARDINO AREA OFFICE FACILITY REPLACEMENT PROJECTS THE NBA TO THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTION FUNDS. STE THESE THREE PROJECTS WERE PREVIOUS APPROVED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. AND EACH OF THESE BUILDING SITES OF ALREADY BEEN ACQUIRED. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRAINTS ON THE NBA THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN PLACED ON HOLD UNTIL OFFERING ALTERNATIVE FUNDING IS SECURED. AND THAT STATED EARLIER WILL DEFER TO OUR PARTNERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THAT. IN REGARDS -- TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ARE REQUESTING FIVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. TO COMPLETE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS FROM OUR LIST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. DUE TO THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MANY SEATS BE FULFILLED FACILITIES NEED MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS. CURRENTLY THE SIEGE PETER FOR MAKING PROJECT.

WELL THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE SIEGE BE WE WORK IN OTHER TASK FORCES IN -- VEHICLE THAT TASK FORCES -- COUNTER TERRORIST TASK FORCES THE DRUG TASK FORCES SO WE UNDERSTAND A FRAMEWORK OF PUTTING TASK FORCES TOGETHER THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE IS RELATED TO RETAIL. PASTORE SO WE DO HAVE SOMEONE ON THE WHEELS YEAH ALTHOUGH MAYBE ONE PART OF IT IS IN THE HEART OF IT IS WHEN THAT WHEN THAT WHEN THE GUESTS ARE STOLEN THEIR TRANSPORTER LIKE YOU SAID THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SOLD ONLINE IT BUT THEN SOME OF THEM. ARE TRANSPORTED TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY'RE SHIPPED OUT FROM THERE. AND THAT'S WHERE CH BECOMES AT BEST THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN AND ALSO -- ON A STATEWIDE BASIS COORDINATING WITH THE OJ. AND THE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YES I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS TO KIND OF ADD ON TO YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS A BUDGET REQUEST THAT WAS SUBMITTED BY DOJ THAT WILL BE UNDER CONSIDERATION UNDER THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET COMMITTEE IT'S FOR ONE POSITION AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND YEAH THIS WHOLE TOPICS A LITTLE BIT TO UNIQUE TO US UP VERY VERY MUCH. SO WE THOUGHT IT ALL RIGHT I STILL LIKE IT. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION SO THAT YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THAT KIND OF COMPLETE PICTURE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS ON THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION TO CONTRACT WITH DOJ OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE STILL KIND OF SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT ROLE WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND IT'S UNCERTAIN THE EXTENT TO WHICH DOJ WILL BE PROVIDING RESOURCES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL WANT TO MAYBE GET FIRM ANSWERS ON BEFORE KIND OF TAKING ACTION ON THIS ITEM SO I THINK THOSE ARE OUR COMMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU THAT THE WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TO DO THAT. YES PLEASE IF I COULD RESPOND TO TO VALLEY AS COMMENTS OF COME PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS TWO POINT ONE MILLION IS BUILT IN ON C. H. P. SIDE IS BECAUSE IT IS C. H. P. WHO'S THAT PASSED WITH THE WITH. LEADING THIS TASK FORCE AND SO. TO THE EXTENT OF THE OF THE LEGISLATION UNDER THE LEGISLATION YES -- TO THE EXTENT THAT DOJ RESOURCES AREN'T AVAILABLE BECAUSE THIS MONEY WOULD BE IN C. H. P.'S BUDGET THEY COULD SUPPLEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL OFFICERS ON THE TASK FORCE IF. THE OJ COULDN'T PROVIDE THEM SO THAT'S PART OF HIS MY WAS STRUCTURED THAT WAY IF YOU WANNA -- A COMMENT ON THE ISSUE REGARDING THE A SUNSET DATE EXTENSION AND THE YOU KNOW THERE WAS A REQUEST TO REJECT THE PROJECT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITH WHICH WE WON'T DO TODAY BUT IF. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT.
