ARE I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE HEARING WOULD YOU LIKE TO THE PRESENT. YES AND- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING. AND GOOD MORNING COMMUNITY MEMBERS- SOME STUFF FONG DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OPS BUDGET PROPOSAL OR THE- PROPOSED OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND- STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS. I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M JOINED HERE ALSO THIS MORNING BY SCOTT MORGAN MY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. SONYA HARRIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND STUFF FROM- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN ADVANCE I IMPORT HAVE TO LEAVE AT NOON TO RUN A STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL QUARTERLY MEETING WHICH I CHAIR. THIS WILL BE OUR FIRST IN PERSON MEETING ESSENCE CORBETT AND- SO BUT- I'LL HAVE ONE OF THE DEPUTY SCOTT MORGAN WILL BE HERE. ON MY BEHALF. D. AS SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL BASED ON COSTS FROM THE ESTATES- PREVIOUS TWENTY TWENTY SENSES AND CORBETT NINETEEN INITIATIVES. THAT WOULD CREATE THE NEW OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN ALL PR TO MANAGE THE STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND COMMUNITY COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS TO REACH CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND AS YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY SENSES AND COVERT NINETEEN OUTREACH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THE STATE INVESTED- AND- INCREDIBLE RESOURCES IN BUILDING CRITICAL OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR REACHING COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST SOCIAL AND HEALTH INEQUITIES. I BELIEVE AS A RESULT OF THAT I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS DONE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN MOST- SPECIALLY ON THAT COVERS OFF REACH BUT ALSO VERY ON THE CENSUS. AS WELL. AS A RESULT OF THAT PROCESS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE AWAY MANY OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED SUCH AS THE NEED TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONSISTENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST SOCIAL INEQUITIES AND BUILD UPON THE EFFORTS AND BUILD ON THE EFFORTS OF TRUSTED MESSENGERS THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WHICH WE ARE NOW APPLYING IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF THE NEW OFFICE- NOT BAD THAT IS FOR. AT A HIGH LEVEL MODEL- FOR THE OFFICE IN. SUB ONE SUPPORT OF A NETWORK OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT ARE ORGANIZED AT THE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LEVEL TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST SOCIAL AND HEALTH INEQUITIES AND THEN BUILDING ON THE EFFORTS OF TRUSTED MESSENGERS OVER TIME AS I MENTIONED SECOND THE USE OF DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING ALLOCATIONS WOULD DRIVE MORE TARGETED RESOURCES AND QUICKER RESPONSE EFFORTS AND THEN THIRD FACILITATING CLOSE COLLABORATION ACROSS THE STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO MAXIMIZE. THE REACH AND IMPACT OF RESOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST INEQUITIES ENSURING AND A CLEAR UNIFIED STATEWIDE APPROACH WITH MESSAGING THAT IS RELIABLE. ACTIONABLE AND BASED. ON THE STATE'S MOST CURRENT INFORMATION. THE PROPOSAL OFFICE WOULD PROVIDE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING PRIORITY ISSUES BRINGING ALL CAMPAIGN EFFORTS TOGETHER UNDER ONE UMBRELLA TO OPERATE IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER. APPLYING THAT MODEL IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPED UNDER THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS AND CALL THE NINETEEN OUTREACH. EFFORTS WILL HELP STRENGTHEN COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE AND ENSURE IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY. WE EXPECT THE OFFICE STUPID MULTIPLE PROGRAMMATIC EFFICIENCIES ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTING TO BETTER OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ON OVERALL GREATER CAPACITY TO GET INFORMATION TO WHO AND WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH STATE PARTNERS INCLUDING GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS KNOWN AS GOV OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OR DGS TO BETTER LEVERAGE EXISTING PROCUREMENT MODELS AND EXPLORE WHAT INNOVATIVE CONTRACTING MODELS ARE AVAILABLE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALLEVIATING SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN CITED BY COMMUNITY PARTNERS THROUGHOUT OUR EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST- THREE YEARS. AND BY BUILDING UP ON THE MODEL IN INFRASTRUCTURE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM- THE RECORDED IN CENSUS THE NEW OFFICE WILL HELP COORDINATE A COMMUNITY COMMUNITY FOCUSED PRACTICE WITH STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ALLOWING US TO REALISE CROSS PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE AND EFFICIENCIES AND I CREATE A VENUE TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY- I BELIEVE INSTITUTIONALIZING PARTNERSHIPS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRUSTED BY COMMUNITIES WE SERVE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITH THE HISTORY OF GOVERNMENT MISTRUST I BELIEVE WILL HELP. TRANSFORM THE PRACTICE OUR OWN PRACTICE OF THE STATE AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHILE ALSO CREATING A VENUE- TO SHARE. BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE ROOTED IN CULTURAL HUMILITY AND THAT'S KIND OF THE- HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE PURPOSE. OF THIS OFFICE- AND I WILL BE HAPPY AND MY STAFF AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE. MENTAL STUFF WHO ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND- WE'LL BE HAPPY.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED A LEGITIMATE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TO BETTER COORDINATE THE STATE'S DISTRICT PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS. HOWEVER WE ALSO RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS REGARDING PROPOSAL'S LACK OF DETAILS AND IN PARTICULAR THE BUDGET PROPOSAL DID NOT PROVIDE A CLEAR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT THAT IS BEING REQUESTED AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT AT THAT TIME. ABLE TO CLEARLY ARTICULATE HOW IT WOULD. SPECIFICALLY USE THE REQUESTED FUNDING TO COST EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS- SPECIFIC OUTREACH.

OVERSEAS SERVICE AND VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIESTHROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THE GOAL TO UNITE DEMOBILIZED TO ENGAGE CALIFORNIANS IN SERVICE TO TAKE ACTION AND- MAKE CHANGE AND CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT WE CAN TACKLE OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES TOGETHER. SO AS WE ALL FOCUSED ON THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION FOR BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEKS TO MAKE ONGOING A LIMITED TERM INVESTMENT OF THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. INTO PROGRAMMATIC CLIMATE PROGRAMS. THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO SUSTAIN THE NATION'S LEADING PROGRAM ON CLIMATE ACTION. WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY AS THE IDEA OF THIS NATIONAL CIVILIAN CLIMATE COURSE STARTS TO BUILD MOMENTUM. THE CLIMATE ACTION CORPS LEVERAGES FEDERAL AMERICORPSFUNDING AND WHILE THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES. THE INTEREST HAS REALLY BEEN SUBSTANTIAL WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PEOPLE APPLYING THAT WE HAVE POSITIONS TO FILL. OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT CALIFORNIA CLIMATE ACTION CORPS HAS DEPLOYED OVER THREE HUNDRED FELLOWS IN FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. INCLUDING IN MANY COMMUNITIES YOU ALL REPRESENT THESE FELLOWS RECEIVE A STIPEND AND A SCHOLARSHIP TO COLLEGE AS WELL AS INVALUABLE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THEY ALSO RECRUITED ENGAGED OVER TEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEER HOURS FOR ITS CLIMATE ACTION. THIS PROGRAM IN THE FELLOWS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR WORK LARGELY IN THREE MAIN AREAS. URBAN GREENING. ORGANIC WASTE AND FOOD RECOVERY AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCY AND JUST EIGHTY ILLUSTRATE THIS WORK QUICKLY. SEVEN SENATOR COME ON OR IN YOUR DISTRICT CLIMATE CORPS FELLOWS HAVE SUPPORTED FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO A TREE PLANTING PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH OUR CLIMATE ACTION CORPS THAT THE LACK OF TREES. AND CANOPY IN CERTAIN. COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE AFFECTED BIKES THREE HE- IS OF THE CLIMB ISSUE. BUT IT IS ALSO A SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE THAT OUR FELLOWS ARE TAKING HEAD ON. AND WE KNOW IN SENATOR COVER YEAR WAS DISTRICT THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE FELLOWS HAVE RUN A LARGE SCALE FOOD RECOVERY. OPERATION TO MAKE SURE THAT FOOD DOESN'T JUST END UP IN A LANDFILL WHICH OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW HAS A SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE CONSEQUENCE. BUT THEY ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOOD GETS TO FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AND IN ADDITION CENTER NIELSEN IN YOUR DISTRICT WE HAVE FELLOWS CURRENTLY WORKING TODAY IN BUTTE COUNTY WITH NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE WILDFIRES ILYIN. AND SENATOR ROB IS YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SERVICE WORK IN YOUR AREA AS WELL SO THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IT'S ALREADY LAUNCHED SEVERAL CAREERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE INTO SUSTAINABILITY WORK. ITSELF PAY DOWN STUDENT DEBT. AND IT'S HELPING CALIFORNIA CHIEF ARE VERY AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. SO THE GOAL OF THIS REQUEST IS TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO FUTURE FUNDING GAPS IN PROGRAMMING OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE FEDERAL AMERICORPS FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO SECURE. AND TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS GROUNDBREAKING PROGRAM SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND- ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY COMMENT. THERE AGAIN KEVIN BURKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY GREAT L.

RYAN RUTHERFORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE JUST WANTED TO- REITERATE AS WE PREVIOUSLY NOTED IN THE EVERY NIGHT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING THAT- ONGOING PROVIDING ONGOING FUNDING TO THE CLIMATE ACTION COURSE SEEMS FROM TRIP THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN THE DISCUSSION OF QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR SENATOR NELSON. SENATOR ROTH. OKAY I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO ECHO THAT CONTINUED- QUESTION ABOUT RIGHT WHY RIGHT NOW I'M RATHER THAN NEXT YEAR AND WHY THE NEED FOR ON GOING FUNDING. THANK YOU SENATOR AGAIN THE REASON FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT AS WE BUILD MOMENTUM FOR THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS WE'RE SEEING ENORMOUS SUCCESS AROUND. THAT THERE ARE NO FUNDING GAPS IN THE FUTURE- FOR PROGRAMMATIC OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE FEDERAL AMERICORPS FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TO SECURE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PROGRAM POSSIBLE. OKAY GREAT AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE ARE GOING TO. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. OUT WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. OKAY REPUBLICAN AT THE END. NOW OUR PARENTS WOULDN'T GO RIGHT TO THE- TO THE VOTE WE DEVOTE ONLY CAN DEVOTE ONLY AND THEN. WORKING FOR THE AREA I BET THIS WITH THE- YEAH KINDA OKAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON I ISSUE ITEM THIRTEEN ENCAMPMENT REMEDIATION GRANT- WHO'S ARE. WOULD YOU ARE YOU HERE TO PRESENT YOU READY. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES I'M READY OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S MY PLEASURE TO COME BEFORE YOU AGAIN I'M VICTOR ON THE GRANTS DIRECTOR OF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS UNDER THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING. AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY ON OUR REQUEST FOR A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. AND ACCOMPANYING TRAILER BILL CHANGES TO PROVIDE LOCAL ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE- WITH GRANTS IN SUPPORT OF PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. AND FOR RESOLVING ENCAMPMENTS SITES ACROSS THE STATE. SO AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE THIS REQUEST TO BUILD UPON THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. IN THIS FIRST GENERATION OF THE PROGRAM WE RECEIVE REQUESTS FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING. FOR PROPOSALS FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIVING IN CAP SO- MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS APPROPRIATED. IN ADDITION WE HEARD FROM MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT EXPRESSED THAT HAD MORE FUNDING THAN AVAILABLE THEY WOULD HAVE SUBMITTED MULTIPLE PROPOSALS AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST ONE CAP IN ANY GIVEN JURISDICTIONS AND MANY OF OUR- ORDERS ACROSS THE STATE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NEED BIGGER ASKS AND MULTIPLE ASKS HAD THE RESOURCES BEEN AVAILABLE- THIS NEED FOR A MUCH LARGER SCALE PROGRAM IS FURTHER REFLECTED IN THE MOST RECENT POINT IN TIME COUNT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING. HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA I'M WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- ARE IN I'M SHELTER SETTING SUCH AS ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED. INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE NATION- SO THIS REQUEST WILL ALLOW US TO FURTHER INVEST IN FLEXIBLE INNOVATIVE AND TARGETED IN CAMDEN RESOLUTION STRATEGIES AT THE SCALE AND WITH THE URGENCY THAT'S NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM- SO WITH THAT HI AND WELCOME QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AYE FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. READ SOME SOME APARTMENTS FINANCED NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU L. A. O. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. THANK YOU MEMBERS NOTICED WHEN I LEFT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AUGMENTATION FOR THE ATTACHMENT MEDIATION PROGRAM MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE WHAT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FOR THE PROGRAM. AT THE TIME THAT WE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE JANUARY PROPOSAL HE HAD NO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION HAVE ALLOCATED. WAS BEING USED AS A RESULT WE CANNOT ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AT THAT TIME SINCE THEN THE MINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED AWARDS FOR THE PROGRAM THE QUESTIONS INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA BY THE STAFF ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR SUGGESTION OF THE LEGISLATURE DEDICATE SOME TIME. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS NOTHING HOW IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ORIGINAL ALLOCATION IS GOING FOR MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT. THE PROPOSED DOCUMENTATION THANK YOU BACK TO OF THE- VICE CHAIR NELSON DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS QUESTIONS. OKAY I'M MIKE JUST ONE QUESTION IS- IF YOU COULD SHARE WHAT OUTCOMES YOU EXPECT ICY AGE TO SEE FROM THESE PROJECTS. FOR THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE WERE ABLE TO FIND NINETEEN PROPOSALS- ACROSS THE STATE AND WE WERE REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE DIVERSE REPRESENTATION IN THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE GRANTED WE HAD RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN MORE THAN SOUTHERN INLAND COASTAL AND SUPPORT FOR ENCAMPMENTS RANGING FOR UP TO TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE HOPE TO SEE IN THE COMING MONTHS. ARE COLLECTIVELY THESE PROJECTS SEEK TO PROVIDE SHELTER AND A PATH TO PERMANENT HOUSING FOR OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS AND THESE PROJECTS ALSO SEEK TO RESTORE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DIFFERENT SITES TO THEIR INTENDED USE AFTER THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN RESIDING THERE ARE TRANSITION TO SHELTER AND THEN A PATH TO PERMANENT HOUSING- IN ADDITION WE'RE BRINGING ON A RESEARCH AND EVALUATION CONTRACTOR WHO WORK WITH US AND I DO CLOSE STUDY OF THESE PROPOSALS AND FUTURE PROGRAMS THAT WE BRING ON THE LINE. TO HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES AND WHAT ARE THEIR STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE AMPLIFIED SHARED AND REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE SO WE HAVE BOTH IMMEDIATE. I WOULD COME THAT WAY LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF. THE OF. HOMELESSNESS RATED WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON THE STREETS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT DOWN THE ROAD- SYSTEMIC SYSTEM CHANGE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR. AND SO HOW IS THIS- HOW WILL THESE IN CAN'T RESOLUTION GRANTS BE DIFFERENT BE BETTER. BENEFIT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN HAPP. SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- THE HALF PROGRAM IS. FOR PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS TO SUPPORT THEIR HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM OVERALL. WHEREAS THIS PROGRAM IS TARGETED FOR SPECIFIC LOCATIONS- TO SERVICE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS SO IT'S A MUCH MORE TARGETED APPROACH- SO YOU KNOW OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE CAP SUPPORTS WHERE HAS THE IN CAMERA SOLUTION FUND AND THIS PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE FLEXIBLE BUT TARGETED FUNDS THAT CAN BE TAILORED TO MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS AND THE SPECIFIC LOCATION- THAT THE PROPOSAL WHICH SEEK TO SUPPORT. AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN. ENCAMPMENTS SIDE BEING RESTORED TO ITS INTENDED USE AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- THIS ITEM IS A HOLD OPEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO ISSUE FOURTEEN- I INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WORK LOAD SUPPORT- IS D. F. C. H. ON THE LINE I SEE YOU ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT. WE ARE. HEADED MORNING MR WOMAN DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS I AM MIKE MILLER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH A PART OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES THREE POSITIONS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE EFFORTS INCLUDING KEY DATA REPORTING ENFORCEMENT UNDER SB NINE SEVENTY THREE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT SYSTEM STATEWIDE TELEWORK SUPPORT AND TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE PRIVACY AND SECURITY FINDINGS AUDITED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT JOINING ME TODAY IS THE OF EACH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR MERRY WEEK AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. OKAY GREAT- FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING AND YOU MARKET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER. HELLO ANY COMMENTS. WITH WITH WITH THE ONLY- NO COMMENTS TO HAPPEN THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU OKAY GRAHAM AND BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR NIELSEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SENATOR ROTH NO QUESTIONS OKAY WELL YOU THIS IS GOING TO BE APPROVED AS BUDGET SO YOU HAVE LOCKED OUT MR MILLER THE LOTTO TODAY I LAST ITEM. JUST FOR THAT ONE THOUGH IS ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION AND CONCILIATION ENHANCEMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. ABSOLUTELY SO OUR SECOND PROPOSAL REQUEST RESOURCES TO DECREASE WAIT TIMES FOR INVESTIGATIVE APPOINTMENTS AND TO INCREASE THE RATE OF CONCILIATION AND SETTLEMENTS WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT DIVISION RELATED T BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING COMPLAINTS. HISTORICALLY THE TYPICAL AVERAGE WAIT TIME BETWEEN THE INTAKE OF A COMPLAINT IN THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW IS APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN COMPLAINTS THAT INCREASED WAIT TIMES AND EMPLOYMENT. FROM THREE MONTHS TO FOUR MONTHS AND IN HOUSING FROM THREE MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE COMPLAINTS INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF THE LABOR MARKET AND WITH THE IMPENDING EXPLORATIONS OF VARIOUS STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL INFECTION MORATORIUMS DESIGNED TO PROTECT TENANTS DURING THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WAIT TIMES IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING HAVE DECREASED AGAIN TO APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OVERALL THROUGH THE USE OF OUT OF CLASSES CITING ITS STRATEGIC OVERTIME AND RECRUITMENT OF RETIRED NEW INTENSE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW US TO BE CREASED AWAY TIME FROM THREE MONTHS TO ONE MONTH AN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CASES OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE ABLE TO CONCILIATE OR SETTLE. AGAIN CHANGING IS VERY WEAK D. V. D. F. EACH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OR HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT MORNING I'M SORRY- AND YOU MIGHT AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER THAT ON THE PROPOSAL OKAY LA- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. NO COMMENTS FROM ONLY OWNS WILL THINK YOU OKAY GREAT I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR NIELSEN. SIR CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO TRACK THE SUCCESS. YOU'RE PUTTING SOMETHING IN PLACE WELL DONE SENATOR NIELSEN WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MICROPHONE IS ON IS IT. THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY I WAS ENQUIRING D. WHAT PROTOCOLS WHAT PROCEDURES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO TRACK THE SUCCESS. DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR BENCHMARKS OR SCHEDULES FOR- IMPERATIVES THAT HAVE TO BE MATH. THE TRIBUNAL NUMBERS OF CONTACTS IN OF POLICE DEPLOYED. BY SUCCESS DO YOU MEAN- BUT OUT COMES OR NOT I MEAN OUTCOME SIR. OH WAIT THAT MIGHT BE I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ONE- WE DO HAVE OUR BENCHMARKS WE HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE SUBMITS- EVERY YEAR THAT- CATALOGS WHERE- COMPLAINTS COME FROM- WHAT TYPES OF COMPLAINTS THEY ARE- HOW LONG CASES TAKE TO RESOLVE- WE- WE DEFINITELY DO KEEP TRACK OF- WHAT TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVED HOW LONG THEY TAKE TO PROCESS. AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE- ONE OF THE PROPOSALS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR- REQUEST IS. WE DO HAVE THE OF OUR INVESTIGATORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO. RESOLVE COMPLAINTS WHILE THEY ARE IN THE INVESTIGATIVE STATE IN ORDER TO CONCILIATE AND SETTLE THEM SO. BEING ABLE TO ALLOW THE INVESTIGATORS MORE TIME WITH A COMPLAINANT OR RESPONDENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR COMPLAINTS SUCCESSFULLY WOULD- CREATE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED RATHER THAN JUST CLOSING CASES A REFERRING THEM TO YOUR MEDI MEDIATION OR LITIGATION. IF THE RESOURCES WERE THERE AND THE TIME WAS ALLOWED FOR THE INVESTIGATORS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY IMPERII BE ABLE TO SETTLEWORK SO WE CASES RATHER THAN REFERRING THEM FOR. PROSECUTION WILL THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE NOW THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE WILL OF THE NEW P. WEISS THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE. SO WHAT WE REQUESTED IS A TEMPORARY FUNDING- THERE WERE THREE YEARS OF LIMITED TERM TEMPORARY FUNDING- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT- NEED IS ON GOING. THE INCREASE IN THE WAIT TIMES THAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR WHEN WE- RIGHT NOW ASSUME MAY HAVE BEEN COVERED RELATED SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ONGOING ISSUE. AND OUR PROPOSAL REALLY IS TO HIRE ADDITIONAL LIMITED TERM STAFFING IN ORDER TO GET PAST THE ISSUE NOW WHEN TO DECREASE THE WAIT TIMES FROM THREE MONTHS TO ONE MONTH. INCREASE THE CONCILIATION AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED PERMANENT RESOURCES GOING FORWARD. SURE YOU OFFERED COBRE THE THAT'S THE STANDARD- BLAME THAT ALWAYS GETS PLACED ON IT EVERYTHING COVERT. IN WHT MANNER HAS CALLED WITH ADDED TO THE DEMANDS OF YOUR WORKLOAD HOW HOW IS THAT MEETING PEOPLE GOING TO SECOND GOING OFF. WORK IN AND- YOU YOU HAD TO BACK FILL OUR WHAT. SO WHEN I REFERENCE CODE WHICH IN OUR WORK WHAT IT REALLY REPRESENTED ITSELF AS AN EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS- WE HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE- SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT WERE BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE THEY WERE ILL OR WHEN THE JOB MARKET RECOVERED AFTER THE PANDEMIC WAS I WANNA SAY OVER BUT NOW THAT THE PANDEMIC IS. A SHIFTED COURSE. NOW THAT THE JOB MARKET HAS RECOVERED WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT COMPLAINTS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE RETURNED TO WORK IN THE HOUSING REALM BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE TRAINS THAT WERE EITHER. EXPIRING OR WERE IN DANGER OF EXPIRING AND WERE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES WE EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN COMPLAINTS BECAUSE OF THAT. READ MOSTLY RELATED OF PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE MORATORIUMS WERE RELATED TO HOPE IT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE YES IT IS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU OKAY SENATOR ROB YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THIS THE COUPLE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MAYBE THIS HAS BEEN ANSWERED AND I JUST MISSED IT SO WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF YOUR VACANCY RATE ON YOUR BACKLOG INCREASE. SO WE DURING COLD. WE DID HAVE AN INCREASE IN OUR VACANCY RATE- RIGHT NOW THE ENFORCEMENT VACANCY RATE IS JUST A- HAIR OVER THIRTEEN PERCENT. SO WE HAVE INSTITUTED A CONTINUOUS JOB POSTINGS FOR OUR INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. WE ARE PULLING APPLICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OUR FIRST CUT OFF WAS JANUARY FIFTEENTH ANDWE HAD ELEVEN HIRES FROM THAT EFFORT WHICH WAS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE VACANCIES. AND OUR SECOND KIND OF JUST HAPPENED ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FILL OUR REMAINING INVESTIGATOR VACANCIES IN THE COMING MONTH- WE DO ADVERTISING TRADE RECRUITING MULTIPLE PLATFORMS BESIDES JUST TELL EACH ARE IN OUR OWN WEBSITE. WE POST ALL OF OUR POSITIONS ON LINK THEN THROUGH RECRUITER- AND WERE ADVERTISING OPENINGS AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NATIONWIDE THROUGH A TOOL THAT. WE HAVE CALLED SIMPLICITY. THANK YOU I ASSUME THERE'S SOME SPOOL UP TIME. IN TERMS OF TRAINING IN GETTING NEW FOLKS UP TO SPEED UNLESS THEY'VE PERFORMED IN THIS AREA IN SOME OTHER FASHION FOR SOME OTHER AGENTS HERE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT YOUR ROLLOUT PLANNED FOR THE STAFFING INCREASES THAT WILL RESULT FROM THIS. APPROPRIATION NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WHAT'S YOUR TIME LINE TO GET FROM A BACKLOG OF IT IF IT'S STILL TRUE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS ON THE EMPLOYMENT SIDE- TO ONE MONTH. SO WITH THE WAIT TIME IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT THREE MONTHS- THERE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THERE IS A BIT OF A SPLIT TIME WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TRAINED- SO THE TRAINING EFFORT THAT WE UNDERTAKE TAKES ABOUT THREE MONTHS- THAT'S- NOT THE END OF IT THE MORE EXPERIENCED. A PERSONAL THAT WE HAVE IF SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS IF NOT DECADES. SO THE YOU KNOW CLEARLY SOMEONE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE CASES AND DO THE MORE QUICKLY. BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THE ONE MONTH MARK WITHIN. PROBABLY THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF APPROVAL. THREE TO SIX MONTHS. YES OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING AWAY SO I GUESS WE'LL HAVE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION ON THAT I HOPE THAT'S TRUE- YOU ALL CERTAINLY DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK OVER THERE AND- I GUESS. I'LL SEE IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT YOU CAN. SO KEEP US POSTED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SENATOR CAREER WOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
