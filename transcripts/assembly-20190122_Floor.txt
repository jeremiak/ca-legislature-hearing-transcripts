HOUSE RESOLUTION SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMO AND RELATIVE TO WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. MS LÃ  MON ON THE RESOLUTION THANK YOU SPEAKER AND TO MEMBERS. TODAY I BRING BEFORE YOU HR SIX COMMEMORATING THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION. IN ROE VERSUS WADE. THIS CASE AFFIRMED EVERY WOMAN HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN. REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN A LEGAL ABORTION. THE ROLE THE WAY DECISION REMAINS THE CORNERSTONE OF A PERSON'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE LIVES. ROE V. WADE WAS A VICTORY FOR WOMEN TO THEIR OWN BODIES. AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY [inaudible] IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF TWO STATES WHERE THE RIGHT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH STATUTE AND OUR CONSTITUTION. HOUSE RESOLUTION SIX SOLIDIFIES THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO PROTECT A PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DECIDE IF. AND WHEN THEY BECOME APPARENT. EVEN WITH THESE PROTECTIONS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION STEEPLY AND LEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN JEOPARDY. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPREME COURT CAN STILL NARROW THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED BY ROE V. WADE. ARE THE HIGHEST RISK OF BEING OVERTURNED. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STUDY AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT ROE VERSUS WADE DECISIONS WITH ACCESS TO LEGAL ABORTION. IT IS VITAL FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY MILLION WOMEN. TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THESE FUNDAMENTAL. ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN PROVIDERS OF REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE ARE UNDER SERIOUS UNRELENTING. ATTACKS TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND LEGAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A STORY WITH YOU. FROM A CONSTITUENT OF MINE. HER MOTHER FIRST BROUGHT HER TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFTER LEARNING SHE WAS SEXUALLY ACTIVE. ALTHOUGH THE FAMILY COULDN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE HER MOTHER KNEW HOW IMPORTANT RECEIVING INFORMATIVE HOLISTIC REPRODUCTIVE CARE WAS. A FEW YOU'RE LATE FEW YEARS LATER THAT SAME MOTHER. FOUND HERSELF IN THE SHOES OF HER DAUGHTER. AT ONE POINT SHE TOOK HER DAUGHTER TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND NOW SHE WAS GOING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO RECEIVE HOLISTIC INFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY THAT MOTHER WAS UNABLE TO CARRY THE BABY TO TERM DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES. THE ABORTION WAS NOT COVERED BY HER INSURANCE. THIS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE REAFFIRMS OUR BELIEF THAT HOLISTIC REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE TO OUR COMMUNITY. MEMBERS. I LIKE MANY OF YOU STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF WOMEN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT ASK CONFIRMED BY ROE V. WADE [inaudible] TO MAKE. OUR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING OUR PREGNANCY AN URGENT AN AYE VOTE ON H. R.. SIX THANK YOU MS LAMONT IS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT HR SIX A RESOLUTION AFFIRMING THE RIGHT OF AMERICAN WOMEN ACCESS ABORTION. AND I RISE TODAY FOR MY FIRST TIME AS AN ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO SHARE MY OWN STORY. TO TALK ABOUT MY OWN ABORTION. BECAUSE MY STORY IS ALSO THE STORY OF MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICAN WOMEN. THE STORY WOMEN WHO CAN'T SPEAK OUT WHO CAN'T RISE TO THIS MICROPHONE. WOMEN WHO UNJUSTLY FACE BULLYING AND SHAME. WOMEN WHO UNJUSTLY STRUGGLE THE EVEN ACCESS ABORTION SERVICES IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAD AN ABORTION. I WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD. IN BETWEEN JOBS AND IN BETWEEN HOMES. I HAD NO HEALTH INSURANCE. STAYING AT A FRIEND'S COUCH UNEMPLOYED. AND FACING AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY WAS A VULNERABLE TIME IN MY LIFE. IN THIS MOMENT. I TURNED TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL NEVER FORGET WALKING INTO THAT CLINIC IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE END EASE I FELT WAS MET WITH ACCEPTANCE AND COMPASSION BY THE STAFF. AFTER A POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST IN A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT MY OPTIONS. I DECIDED ABORTION WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR ME. ACCESS TO ABORTION IS OFTEN DEBATED IN OUR POLITICS IN THE ABSTRACT. BUT BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE WHEN AND WHEN NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN IS FOR MANY WOMEN AS IT WAS FOR ME AN EXTREMELY PERSONAL. AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION. FOR ME HAVING AN ABORTION WAS AN EMPOWERING DECISION. ONE THAT I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED. IT WAS NOT YET MY TIME TO HAVE CHILDREN. FOR MANY WOMEN THIS DECISION COMES WITH HEARTBREAKING STRUGGLE. FOR MANY WOMEN A DIFFERENT DECISION IS MADE. BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS OUR DECISION TO MAKE. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER. I AM AN ASSEMBLY WOMAN A WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF A TWO YEAR OLD GIRL NAMED JOSEPHINE. WE CALL HER JO JO AND SHE IS MY HEART. SINCE MY ABORTION I WORKED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR SIX YEARS INCLUDING IN HIS WHITE HOUSE AS PART OF THE TEAM THAT HELPED PASS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I LAUNCH THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S INITIATIVE AIMED AT GETTING BETTER PAID LEAVE POLICIES IN MORE AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. I RUN A STATEWIDE PARENT ORGANIZING PROGRAM TO GET MORE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I'VE HELPED TO LIKE STRONG WOMEN LEADERS TO OFFICE. WHEN THEY LOOK AT HOW MY LIFE HAS UNFOLDED IN THESE FIFTEEN YEARS I AM ALL THE MORE JUST MORE CERTAIN ABOUT MY DECISION? IT DOES ALLOW ME TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE CHILDREN WHEN I'M READY. THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SAFE ABORTIONS UNDER THREAT. EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE PEOPLE WORKING TO UNDERMINE ROE V. WADE TO RESTRICT A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO ABORTION. EVERY DAY THERE ARE LEGISLATORS TRYING TO PASS ANTI ABORTION BILLS. LIKE THE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS ANTI ABORTION LAWS ENACTED AT THE STATE LEVEL IN THE LAST DECADE. EVERY DAY DONALD TRUMP IS WORKING TO CONFIRM JUDGES WHO WOULD OVER TORN OR HOLLOW OUT OUR ABORTION RIGHTS. THAT'S WHY IN THIS STATE IN THIS CHAMBER WE FIGHT EVERY DAY NOT ONLY TO A HOLD ROVI WEIGHED BUT TO EXPAND ABORTION ACCESS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL. TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE TO STAND UP FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND TO TO STIGMATIZE ABORTION. A PROCEDURE THAT ONE QUARTER OF AMERICAN WOMEN WILL HAVE IN THEIR LIFETIMES. I'M PROUD TO SHARE MY STORY WITH YOU TODAY AND I ASKED YOU STAND WITH ME AND SUPPORT HR. SIX THANK YOU MISS WICKS. THIS METHOD WITH. YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A WOMAN WHO HAS SURVIVED TO HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES TO DELIVER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS WHOSE FREEDOMS AND WHOSE FUTURES ARE PRECIOUS TO ME. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SIX TO COMMEMORATE THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE. IN THE FORTY SIX YEARS SINCE ROE WAS DECIDED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WOMEN'S LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED BY ACCESS TO LEGAL ABORTION CARE. WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE PATH OF OUR OWN LIVES. AS I HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND A WOMAN'S LIFE LIBERTY HEALTH AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING ARE UNDENIABLY TIED TO HER REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO END PREGNANCIES IN A SAFE AND TIMELY MANNER. WE DESERVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE WE NEED AN ACCESS IT WITH DIGNITY. TODAY ABORTION IS ONE OF THE SAFEST MEDICAL PROCEDURES AVAILABLE. 43% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HOWEVER DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ABORTION CARE. MEANING THE APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION WOMEN WHO LIVE IN THESE COUNTIES MUST FACE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO OBTAIN THE CARE THEY NEED. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER ON ACCESS BUT EVEN ON QUE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO BETTER WE MUST. TODAY IS A DAY TO CELEBRATE HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN CALIFORNIA TO EXPAND AND PROTECT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL. BUT IT IS ALSO A DAY TO RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND EQUALITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON HR. SIX MS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CAUCUS. TO SUPPORT H. R. SIX TO MARK THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE ABORTION HAS BECOME ONE OF THE SAFEST MEDICAL PROCEDURES IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE SAFETY RECORD OF OVER 99%. ROE V. WADE ALLOWS WOMEN TO CONTROL THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIVES. PROTECTING OUR HEALTH AND FREEDOM [inaudible] AS WOMEN. WE HAVE BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE. DENIED THE RIGHT TO WORK. AND DENIED THE RIGHT TO CONTROL OUR BODIES. AND WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT AGAINST THOSE PREJUDICES. YET THESE FIGHTS CONTINUE TO WAGE. IN MICRO AND IN MACRO WAYS. BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON. A WOMAN KNOWING WHAT IS BEST FOR HERSELF. REMAINS IN QUESTION. ACCESS IS TRULY ON THE LINE. WITH SEVERAL CASES JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE SUPREME COURT NARROWING ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE. THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE. AND THE STAFF SUPREME COURT ARE THREATENING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. WHEN HEALTH CARE IS ATTACKED? THE POLICIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND YOUNG PEOPLE. WE MUST WORK TO ENSURE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHO YOU ARE WHERE YOU LIVE OR HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE. 82% OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ACCESS TO A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH PROVIDES A VARIETY OF HEALTH SERVICES TO OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA. OPPONENTS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL TELL YOU THAT TAXPAYERS ARE FUNDING ABORTIONS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS NOT TRUE LAST YEAR PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROVIDED. ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CANCER SCREENINGS AND ADMINISTERED ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION S. T. I. TESTS. THOSE TESTS ALONE. SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THESE ARE OUR BODIES. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR US. CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE LEADING THE FIGHT FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. AND HR SIX INSURES THAT WOMEN HAVE THE FULL PROTECTIONS THAT WERE GUARANTEED UNDER ROE V. WADE. SO AS A WALK WOMAN AND AS A PROUD MEMBER OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES. I THINK WE'VE TIRED THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR. SIX THERE WAS KAMLAGER-DOVE MISS KOREA [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR SIX TO COMMEMORATE THE LANDMARK US SUPREME COURT DECISION. THAT ENSURES A PERSON'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. TO A SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. AS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN OUR COUNTRY TO LEGALIZE ABORTION. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPOWERED WITH THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WELL TODAY WE COMMEMORATE THE PROGRESS WE HAVE ACHIEVED. SINCE THIS GROUNDBREAKING DECISION. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT ACCESS TO ABORTION CONTINUES TWO VERY DRASTICALLY DEPENDING ON ONE'S RACIAL ETHNIC AND SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. IT IS CRITICAL. NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO CHOOSE WHEN AND HOW. THEY WOULD LIKE TO START A FAMILY. IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR. THE SPEAKER ORGANIZED A DELEGATION TO ALL SALVADOR. MY COUNTRY OF BIRTH. WHEN ASKED WHAT WHERE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS? I IMMEDIATELY SAID. WOMEN'S RIGHTS. WOMEN'S WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. AND IT WAS CHALLENGED BECAUSE AS A PROUD TO ANOTHER ANYA. AS A PROUD WOMAN WOMAN OF COLOR AND NOW IS A PROUD MEMBER OF THIS BODY. HOW DO YOU GO TO YOUR HOME COUNTRY AND SAY WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS IS IMMORAL? YOU SEE THE COUNTRY ABLE SALVADOR'S INCARCERATING WOMEN FOR SIMPLY HAVING A MISCARRIAGE. SOMETHING THAT IS A NATURAL AND PAINFUL EXPERIENCE TO A WOMAN. AND WE HAD THOSE HARD AND TOUGH CONVERSATIONS. AND WHEN YOU QUESTION WHAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A STATE. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVING A STATE TO COUNTRY CONVERSATION? THAT IS THE POWER OF WHAT WE DO. WE HAVE A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THE ISSUE. WE ARE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN. WE ARE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR FAMILIES AND I AM THANKFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES IN OUR COLLEAGUES THAT WERE ON THAT DELEGATION WITH ME IN. AND TO THE SPEAKER WHO ALLOWED FOR THAT CONVERSATION TO TAKE PLACE. BECAUSE THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT EASY. AND WE FIND OURSELVES NOW IN A TIME IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. WHERE WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND OUR CHOICES ARE QUESTION? AND SO TODAY AND ALWAYS WHETHER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS OUR NATION OR ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE MUST STAND UNITED. FOR WHAT IS RIGHT FOR WHAT IS JUST. FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION. OVER HER OWN BODY. SO I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR HR SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS KOREA. IS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I ALSO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF H. R.. SIX RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT FORTY SIX YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE AND THE CERTIFICATION OF ROE V. WADE AS THE LAW OF THE LAND. OUR SUPPORT IS MORE IMPORTANT MORE URGENT AND MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER. BECAUSE THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK. IS NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE REPRESENTING SANTA BARBARA AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT THE RIGHTS PROTECTED BY ROE V. WADE. THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY THE RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. INCLUDING SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION CARE. BUT DESPITE THE SUPPORT RUBY WAIT IS NEVER BEEN MORE AT RISK THAN IT IS TODAY. THERE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY CASES THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY GOT PROTECTIONS OF ROW. AND WITH TWO OF TRUMP'S ANTI CHOICE APPOINTEES NOW ON THE SUPREME COURT THE THREAT OF OVERTURNING ROE. OF CRIMINALIZING ABORTION. AND OF PUNISHING WOMEN IS REAL AND IMMEDIATE. THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS REINSTATED THE GLOBAL GAG CRAWL. PROPOSED A DOMESTIC GAG RULE ENABLED EMPLOYERS TO DENY INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BIRTH CONTROL FOR VIRTUALLY ANY REASON. THE ONSLAUGHT OF FEDERAL ATTACKS AND WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IS UNRELENTING. THE CALIFORNIA AS IN SO MANY WAYS WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THE RESISTANCE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE MISOGYNY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE THIS IS ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO ACCESS AND IS SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. THIS IS ABOUT A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT HER OWN BODY. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON HR SIX BAUER-KAHAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED [inaudible] DRAFT. TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SIX AS A WOMAN. A MOTHER AND A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. ROE V. WADE RECOGNIZED WOMAN'S RIGHT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY OVER THEIR OWN BODIES. ROW ISN'T JUST A SUPREME COURT CASE. IF THE PROMISE THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS THE POWER AND DIGNITY. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN LIFE. BODY AND FUTURE. THE WOMAN WHO IS KERRY CHILDREN. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING THAT DECISION ONESELF. AND IS THE GREAT SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA SENATOR HARRIS POINTED OUT IN THE RECENT HEARINGS OF JUDGE CABIN ON THERE ARE NO LAWS THAT IMPINGE ON THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY FOR MEN. BY STRIKING DOWN CRIMINAL ABORTION LAWS ROW CREATED THE PROMISE THAT ANYONE WHO DECIDES TO END A PREGNANCY IS ABLE TO DO SO SLEEVE SAFELY. WITH DIGNITY AND FREE FROM ARREST. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN EXPANDING AND PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. THROUGH ARE STATE CONSTITUTION AND THROUGH THE REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY ACT [inaudible] AND YET. THE REALITY OF ROW AROUND THE COUNTRY IS THE ANTI CHOICE EXTREMISTS. HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS TO CHIP AWAY AT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THROUGH OUR COURTS ARE STATE HOUSES. AND NOW THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION CRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION IS ON THE RISE. TWELVE STATES HAVE A PRE ROLL BAND AND OR A TRIGGER BAN IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY CRIMINALIZE ABORTION IF ROE IS OVERTURNED. ANOTHER SEVEN STATES HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTENT TO RESTRICT THE RIGHT TO ABORTION IF ROE IS OVERTURNED. SINCE TWENTY TEN STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE PASSED SOME FOUR HUNDRED ANTI CHOICE BILLS. AS THE NEW YORK TIMES RECENT EDITORIAL A WOMEN'S RIGHTS CAUTIONED US MORE AND MORE LAWS ARE TREATING A FETUS IS A PERSON. AND A WOMAN AS LESS OF ONE AS STATES CHARGE PREGNANT WOMEN WITH CRIMES. BOTH PARTIES USED TO AGREE THAT ABORTION IS A PRIVATE MATTER. BUT IN THE LAST FEW DECADES FAR RIGHT EXTREMISTS HAVE EMBRACED A FETAL RIGHTS. INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE ROE AND DIMINISH THE RIGHTS OF PREGNANT WOMEN. THE PUBLIC DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF PERSONHOOD. IN MISSISSIPPI VOTERS REJECTED PERSONHOOD BALLOT MEASURE BY SIXTEEN POINTS. NORTH DAKOTA REJECTED A SIMILAR MEASURE BY TWENTY NINE POINT. IN COLORADO VOTERS REJECTED ANY ANTI CHOICE PERSONHOOD BALLOT. BY A THREE TO ONE MARGIN. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN LIFE BEGINS BELONGS WITH OUR SCIENTISTS. OUR CLERGY AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. IN FACT IN JUDAISM. LIFE BEGINS AT BIRTH. NOT A CONCEPTION. THIS IS A PRIVATE DECISION THE EACH OF US MUST MAKE IN PRIVATE CONSULTATION WITH OUR OWN TRUSTED SOURCES. THIS CONVERSATION DOES NOT BELONG IN A POLITICAL AGENDA. THAT ARE ROADS THE EXISTING RIGHTS OF A PARTICULAR CLASS WOMEN. IN FACT WE KNOWS THE CONTROL OF ONE'S OWN REPRODUCTIVE FUTURE IS THE GREATEST EQUALIZER OF WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE. IN CALIFORNIA WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON LEADING THE NATION AND WE DO. BUT WE'RE NOT IMMUNE. AS THE WAR AGAINST WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE MUST CONTINUE TO LEAD. IN CALIFORNIA MY WE MUST RECOMMIT TO GUARANTEEING THAT ANYONE WHO DECIDES TO ACCESS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. IS ABLE TO DO SO SAFELY. EFFECTIVELY. WITH THE DIGNITY. AND FREE FROM ARREST. WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY OVER THEIR OWN BODIES. AS GUARANTEED IN ROW. AND SHOULD BE MAKING THEIR REPRODUCTION OF DECISIONS WITHOUT GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON HR SIX THANK YOU. MR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I JUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT PERSONALLY FROM.

HONORED RICE'S SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU WAS COOLEY MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT. I AM FULLY AWARE THAT ANY COMMENTS THAT I MAKE TO ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE ANYONE'S MIND HERE AND THAT'S NOT WHY STAND -- AND TYPICALLY I DON'T STAND UP AND SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE VOTE ON EVERY YEAR. UP BY THIS YEAR. I JUST I FEEL COMPELLED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO VOICE IN THESE CHAMBERS EVERY YEAR WE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION AND I RESPECT THE FACT. THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES SEE THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO I'M I'M OKAY WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING -- BUT THE ONE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME IS THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS BROUGHT UP AND THERE IS MUCH DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO CONTROL THEIR BODIES THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. YET THERE IS NEVER ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE YET. BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THEIR AND I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT IS. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING IN THESE CHAMBERS ABOUT PROTECTING. A AND KEEPING SAFE CHILDREN. MINORITIES WOMEN LGBT COMMUNITY EVERYBODY UNDER THE SUN EXCEPT. FOR THE UNBORN. THEY HAVE NO VOICE. AND TO THOSE SITTING IN THE IN THE GALLERY IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT THEY HAVE NO ADVOCATES HERE. BUT THEY DO. THERE ARE FEWER OF US BUT THEY DO SO I AM RISING ON BEHALF OF THE UNBORN. I'M RISING AS THE MOTHER OF FIVE HE WASBLESSED TO BE ABLE TO BRING. FIVE LIVES INTO THIS WORLD. I DON'T JUDGE OTHERS WHO MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION. BUT I ASK THAT WE RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO. WHO BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE? WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE YOUR FIRST RECORD NOT. I JUST ASK THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DROWN OUT THE VOICES. WITH THE ROARING CROWD OF SAYING THAT ROE V. WADE IS IN JEOPARDY OR THAT I BECAUSE I'M I'M I'M A PRO LIFE. PERSON THAT I SOMEHOW DON'T BELIEVE IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS. THAT'S AN AFFRONT TO ALL OF US THAT DO. AND THE TWO CAN COEXIST. SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE.

THAT THERE WOULD AT LEAST BE A RECOLLECTION. AND A HEART FELT APPRECIATION. FOUR CHOICE OF A DIFFERENT KIND. AND I STAND HERE. AS I SAID NOT IN JUDGMENT. BUT S. A WITNESS. TO A DIFFERENT DECISION. AND THE JOY THAT THAT. CAN CREATE. WE WE DON'T CELEBRATE DON'T WRITE. RESOLUTIONS WE DON'T. BRING WOMEN HERE. TO ENCOURAGE AND CELEBRATE [inaudible] THAT [inaudible] DECISION. AND I I WOULD JUST. BE REMISS IF I DID NOT STAND DOWN VOICE. WHAT'S IN OUR HEARTS. AND INSURANCE HEART. AND THAT THIS CHOICE OF A DIFFERENT. NATURE. CAN BE ONE WITHOUT THE KIND OF ABSOLUTE AN IRREVOCABLE. DECISION [inaudible] AND YET. THAT IS A DECISION THAT CAN BE MADE AND IS [inaudible] LEGAL. NOW I AM DOING IS. RISING TO THANK TWO WONDERFUL. WOMEN. AND TO HONOR. THE JOYFUL CONSEQUENCES. OF THAT CHOICE [inaudible] JASON [inaudible] LINDSEY [inaudible] LITTLE NOAH [inaudible] JENNA [inaudible] LESS THAN [inaudible] ANJO V.. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE FOR STANDING UP AND SHARING THEIR ISSUE ARE THERE THEIR STORIES IN THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO WILL BE WAIVED -- WHEN I MET MY WIFE WHAT WE TALKED WE HAD A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION -- WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING ABOUT YOU KNOW IN THE EVENT? THAT MY WIFE EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS MY WIFE AT THE TIME IF YOU WERE TO BECOME PREGNANT. WHAT WOULD WE DO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE DECISION OF WHETHER WE'RE VERY EMPHATIC IN OUR DECISION TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE DOES BECOME PREGNANT ABORTION WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WERE GOING TO PURSUE WE WERE GOING? TO HAVE THE BABY -- NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE WHETHER WE FELT WE ARE MAYBE READY OR NOT BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ROE V. WADE WAS THAT IT GIVES US GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE WEIGHT IS ABOUT AS HAVE HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF I AGREE AS A MAN I THINK IT'S IT'S JUST NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO TELL A WOMAN WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH THEIR BODY THAT IS JUST NOT MY BUSINESS. AND TO TO NOW HAVE THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE -- RIGHT NOW WITH THIS ISSUE COMING BACK UP YOU JUST NEED TO REMEMBER THAT. THIS DOESN'T SAY THAT EVERYONE HAS TO BE PRO CHOICE THIS ROBY WAY GIVES EVERYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES YOU WANT TO BE PRO LIFE. YOU CAN BE PRO LIFE YOU CAN BE PRO LIFE WITHIN YOUR OWN FAMILY AND MAKE THAT CHOICE TO NOT GET AN ABORTION IF YOU WANT TO BE CHOICE AND YOU WANT. TO X. EXPERIENCE OR NOT EXPERIENCE BUT MAKE THE DECISION. TO GET AN ABORTION YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE. TO TO ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOURSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO ALLOW YOU TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOUR FAMILY AND MAKE THAT DECISION WITHIN YOUR FAMILY. AND I CANNOT THINK OF SOMETHING MORE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A GOVERNMENT TO DO THAN TO COME INTO YOUR BEDROOM IN TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR YOU. OR TO TAKE THAT DECISION AWAY FROM YOU SO I I OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT ROE V. WADE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS BODY AND FOR THE STATE TO RECOGNIZE ITS IMPORTANCE NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT NATIONALLY. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] MR STONE. YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU. AS AN ALL WHITE MAN I THINK I NEED TO EXPLAIN -- MAYBE. MAYBE MAYBE NOT [inaudible] IT. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO SPEAKING ABOUT CHOICE. AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE JOURNEY THAT HIS FAMILY WENT THROUGH. BECAUSE REALIZE MOST WOMEN FACE WITH THIS CHOICE. DON'T CHOOSE AN ABORTION. AND IN FACT WE HEARD THIS BILL. IN THE COMMITTEE I WAS KIND OF ASTONISHED AT THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION WAS REALLY MORE FOCUSED ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND THEY USED THE TERM THAT WAS REALLY NEW TO ME THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. WHICH WAS A REAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. AND WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE WHAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROVIDES. IS SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LOW COST. HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD HEALTH SERVICES. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WHAT I APPLIED PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR BEING ONE OF THE FEW VENUES? THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES CHOICE THAT'S ABOUT WHAT ROE VERSUS WADE IS ABOUT. IS SAYING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GET OUT OF THE DECISION. PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION A WOMAN HAS TO MAY. AND TO THINK THAT SHE IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE ON BOARD THE CHILD THAT SHE IS CARED IF THE THINK SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT CONNECTION WELL [inaudible] IS. AS I'M TOLD AND AS HIVE LEARNED. COMPLETELY UNTRUE. SO FOR US TO STAND HERE AS A BODY AS MEN. WE SHOULD BE DEFERRING TO THE STORIES TO THE PERSPECTIVES TO THE EMOTION THAT'S INVOLVED. AND NOT TAKE ANY OF IT FOR GRANTED. ROE VERSUS WADE WHICH IS UNDER ASSAULT AND THERE ARE IN FACT MANY RIGHTS. BETTER UNDER ASSAULT THE CALIFORNIA'S TRYING TO PROTECT OF OUR PEOPLE. WHICH IS WHY WE WORK SO HARD THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPACE ON THE CHILD WELFARE SPACE ON SO MANY OTHER THINGS TAKE TAKE TAKE CARE OF FAMILIES. THAT DO MAKE THAT DECISION. TO HAVE A CHILD AND WHO STRUGGLE WITH BEING ABLE TO RAISE THAT CHILD. SO WE NEED TO SUPPORT. PEOPLE'S DECISIONS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN SELVES AND THEIR OWN BODIES THAT'S REALLY WHAT ROE V. WADE IS ABOUT IT'S REALLY. THE SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF IT IT'S REALLY ALL IT IS ABOUT IS ABOUT CHOICE. AND WHO GETS TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. SO I STAND SUPPORT OF HR. SIX ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. ON THE RESOLUTION HAVING SEIZE. MISTER MONEY MAY CLOSE THANK YOU. TODAY WE'VE HEARD OTHER IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES DIFFERENT VOICES. BUT THE THEMES ARE THE IMPORTANCE OF CHOICE. AND HOW MUCH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO STAND% BEHIND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS WOMEN TO MAKE THAT CHOICE NO MATTER HOW COMPLICATED. OR HARD THAT DECISION CAN BE IT IS OUR DECISION. IT'S ALSO THE FORTY SIX YEAR ANNIVERSARY. AND EVERY YEAR WE AS WOMEN RISE AND STAND AND HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT. THAT WE HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THIS DECISION. NEXT YEAR WILL LIKELY NOT BE THE EXCEPTION. AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE RHETORIC AND THE CONVERSATIONS. AND THE VERY REAL THREAT THAT THIS RATE MAY BE TAKEN AWAY FROM US. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO REASSURE THE STATE AND THE TWENTY MILLION WOMEN IN THIS STATE. THAT WE WILL FIGHT FOR THIS FOR THIS CHOICE. AND FOR THAT MEMBERS I ASKED WE WILL I ON THIS RESOLUTION.

SO WHO WAS BORN ON NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND DIED THIS OCTOBER. NINTH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN HE DIED IN A AND A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT HE WAS HIT BY A CAR. AND I'M REALLY GOING TO BE SHARING. UP BILLY STORY AND BILLY STORY IS A STORY THAT IS UNLIKE MANY OF OUR STORIES HERE WHERE WE IN GERMAN AND MEMORY. MANY TIMES WHEN WE INJURE AND AND A MEMORY OF SOMEBODY THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH IN THEIR LIFE. THEY HAVE OF MADE IS PROUD THEY HAVE FAMILY THAT. WANTS. TO BE THERE FOR SERVICE OR A FEW THE STORY IS LIKE THAT OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND ACROSS THE WORLD SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T FEEL FITS THAT BILLING. HE WAS EIGHTY SAID IN A LINE OF TEN CHILDREN. HE WAS VERY ACTIVE AND ATHLETIC. HE WAS FUNNY HE WAS SMART BUT EARLY ON IN HIS CHILDHOOD HE HAD DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL HE OFTEN WAS DISCIPLINE. AS A TEACHER MYSELF I THINK BACK THAT HE PROBABLY DID HAVE ADHD BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED. HE WAS BORN TO A TEENAGE MOTHER. WHO HAD TEN CHILDREN AND IN THE TIME THAT HE WAS BORN IN THE SIXTIES MANY TIMES? FAMILIES AT THAT TIME DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY COULD. APPROACH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ASK FOR TESTING AGAIN AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD MOTHER -- SHE DID LISTEN TO WHAT THE TEACHER SAID SO HE WOULD BE DISCIPLINE NORMALLY AT SCHOOL BUT MANY TIMES AT HOME. THIS LED TO NOT ONLY ISSUES IN SCHOOL BUT EARLY INTERFACING WITH THE JUVENILE DEPARTMENT WHERE. HE STARTED A PATTERN OF GOING IN AND OUT OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM AND THAT CONTINUED REALLY THE REST OF HIS LIFE. BILLY WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD A YOUNG BOY BEFORE HE WAS EIGHTEEN AND LATER A DAUGHTER. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS IN IN NOW WITH THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE OF HIS ADDICTION ISSUES OF ALCOHOL. HIS LIFE CONTINUED ON A PATTERN OF A DOT DOWN WORLD SPIRAL. AND WITH MANY MANY FAMILY MEMBERS TRYING TO INTERVENE AT EVERY STEP POSSIBLE. THERE WAS NO CURE OR FOR SOMEONE WITH CHRONIC ADDICTION ALCOHOLISM. WHICH FOR MANY OF US WHO HAVE SUFFERED THAT IN FAMILIES WE KNOW IT IS A DISEASE. BUT WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THAT. WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF UP PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF SOBER LIVING AND YET. THEY DON'T RECOVER. BILLY SUFFERED WITH ADDITIONAL ISSUES BECAUSE IF YOU'VE BEEN ON A CHRONIC ALCOHOL. OF ALCOHOLIC YOU WOULD HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR HEALTH FROM LIVER DISEASE TO IS OUR EYES. TO ALSO A HERNIA AS BILLY AGE TO CONTINUED IN THE SYSTEM. AND HOMELESSNESS BECAME AN EVEN GREATER ISSUE AS HIS MOTHER. MY MOTHER. DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BE BY HIS SIDE THERE STILL WAS NOT A PLACE AS SHE LIVED IN -- A SENIOR CONDO. SO EVEN WITH HER TRYING TO HELP HIM SHE WOULD GET LETTER SAYING HE COULDN'T STAY THERE WE ALL TRY TO HELP ALL OF MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND BILLIE STORY IS NOT UNIQUE WE SEE THIS EVERY DAY ON OUR STREETS AND MY PLAYED TO US IS TO LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE. TO KNOW THEIR STORIES TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE AND SO AS I STAND ON THIS FLOOR. BEGINNING MY THIRTEEN THIRD TERM I CAN TELL YOU I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HOMELESSNESS ISSUES AND I WILL NOT SHRINK WHEN PEOPLE SAY. WELL WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR THEM OR THEY DON'T BELONG HERE OR IT COSTS TOO MUCH WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AS A STATE AND AS A COUNTRY BECAUSE BILLY STORY IS OUR STORY.
