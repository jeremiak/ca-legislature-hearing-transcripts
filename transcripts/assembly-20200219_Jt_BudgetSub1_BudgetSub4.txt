ONE AND SUB FOR ON HOMELESSNESS- I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING MY CO CHAIR WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER WHO WILL FOLLOW WITH SOME OPENING COMMENTS. BUT SINCE- WE JUST HEARD A STATE OF THE STATE I DID WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GOVERNOR ON HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS COMPLEX AND WILL REQUIRE US AS A STATE TO LEAN IN- I WISH IT WAS AS EASY AS HE SAID AS A DOCTOR BEING% ABLE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR HOUSING. AND YET KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES THERE'S PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT AND PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND SO. WE WILL HOLD THIS HEARING TODAY TO HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ABOUT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS- BUT DO HOPE WE AS A STATE CAN CONTINUE TO LEAN AND LOOK TO THIS GOVERNOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. WITH THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER. THANK YOU. DOCTOR AMBLE- LOOKING THE JOINT HEARING ON HOMELESSNESS. TO THEIR COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES. TO HIS PLAN. I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO PROBLEMS TO ADDRESS WITH REGARD TO HOMELESSNESS. THAT INCLUDE HAILING THE KERN EMERGENCY ON THE STREETS AND INSURING THAT MORE PEOPLE DAHLE FALLING HOMELESSNESS. THE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. MILL WORKS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THAT IS SIMPLY TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WHICH INCLUDES. LIMITING RIGHT. AS A GOVERNOR'S DID TO THE STATE TODAY. AND PROVIDE SERVICES. BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS CALL FOR EARLY ACTION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE USE OUR TIME. TODAY EFFECTIVE. LAST WEEK BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SIX HELD A HEARING. WHETHER WE DISCUSSED OUR CONCERNS OF TE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO SPECIFICALLY. I'M SEES ME THIS THIS. REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE I'M HOPING WE CAN MOVE BEYOND THAT HEARING AND GET TO THE HEART OF THE EFFORT BEFORE US. WHAT PROBLEMS ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE IN THIS EARLY ACTION EFFORT. TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING THEMES INCLUDED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. ONE BEING REGIONALIZATION. TO ACCOUNTABILITY THREE NOT SPRING THE FUNDING TO THIN AND FOR HOW TAKE. TAKE THE SAME APPROACH DOESN'T WORK. I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR FROM OUR PANELISTS ON HELP POLLS OLD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN SOME RESPECTS ON HEAT ON HOW HE PARKS AND HAPPY. DID NOT IN THEIR OPINION. I ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME ALL MEMBERS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND BY ANY MEMBER TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT. WE SOME GREAT PANELS TODAY SELECT STAR BY INVITING LOTUS FROM ALICE FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO BEGIN. MR LACKEY YOU HAVE ANY. COMMENTS WELL. THERE YOU GO I LIKE THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M YOUR BEST MORALIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE MAKING COMMENTS AND REFERENCING THE TENDER BUT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. AT THE HEAD CAN PROVIDING SOME CONTEXT TO THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA- THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO LAYS OUT SOME CHARACTERISTIC CLEAN OUT THE SIZE OF THE HOME WITH THIS POPULATION AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. A STATEWIDE NOTING THAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT 27% OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION WITH ABOUT 23% OF THIS POPULATION HAVING A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND 227% OF THE POPULATION BEING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. HE OF THE HAND OUT ON TO LAY OUT THE STATE AND LOCAL RELATIONSHIP HISTORICALLY IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WE SEE THAT HISTORICALLY NOW I'M SPEAKING FROM PAGE FOR. THE STATE HAS PROVIDED A NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT REALLY RELATE TO SORT OF FOUR AT THIRTY THREE MAIN AREAS IN EITHER. HELPING TO BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH THE FORM OF TAX CREDITS HELPING INDIVIDUALS AFFORD HOUSING THROUGH THINGS LIKE VOUCHERS AND THEN PROVIDING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT WHILE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO. HOUSING HELP BILLS OF SELF THE STAIN ON THE TH OF THE STATE AND SEE- SUFFICIENT EXCUSE ME WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN UP PREVENT AN ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- AT THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE THE STATE WIDE HAVE COME FROM. A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS IN A NUMBER OF FUNDING SOURCES AND WE'VE SEEN THAT FUNDING HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE IN PART TO SOME RECENT- ONE TIME AUGMENTATION THAT HAVE BEEN RATHER LARGE. SO WITH. USE OF THE STATE AND DOLLARS WE SEE THAT SERVICES I'VE REALLY BEEN HISTORICALLY PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH A UNDERSTANDING THAT LOCALS ARE MOST IN TUNE TO THE HOMELESS NEEDS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. SO ON PAGE SIX WE LAY OUT THE THREE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE STATE HAS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME DOLLARS IN INTEREST IN SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. THESE PROGRAMS WHY ARE THERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IS AS IN THE CASE OF NO PLACE LIKE HOME OR AUTHORIZED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. TAKE A SIMILAR TACT WHERE FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED LOCALLY EACH WITH THEIR OWN SENT A SET OF ELIGIBLE USES AN ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS BUT GENERALLY IT THESE HAVE BEEN CONDUITS OF DELIVERING RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS. HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY IN TOTAL WE SEE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS BEING MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THESE THREE SOURCES. IN THE BEGINNING ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE HAND OUT WE SEE- TABLE THAT PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S- HOMELESSNESS PLAN BOTH RELATED TO HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AS WELL AS COMPONENT THAT WERE INCLUDED IN HIS BUDGET FOR THIS. UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR. I REALLY FOCUS OUR MY SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS ON THE FIRST TWO ITEMS UNDER THE BUDGET TO THIS IS THE CASF FUND THE- AS WELL AS CHANGES TO MEDICARE I'LL- SO I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THESE PROPOSAL WORK. BUT GENERALLY WE SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- DEPOSITED TOWARDS THIS NEW SYSTEM WITHIN DFF THAT ESTABLISHES REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND DELIVERS FUNDS LOCALLY. AS WELL AS- REFORMS TO MEDIC COW THAT WOULD MAKE HEALTH RELATED I'M SORRY HOUSING RELATED SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SO BIG WITH OUR CAR ON THESE. ON PAGE ELEVEN OF THE HANDOUT. FOR THE NEW FUND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- WE JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS A NEW MECHANISM FOR DELIVERING SERVICES LOCALLY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS- WHY ARE THEY NOTED OR TO BRIEFLY THERE ALREADY A NUMBER OF ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DELIVERING HOUSING HOLD WITH THE SERVICES SO THIS DOES COMPLICATE THE STATE LOCAL RELATIONSHIP AND DELIVERING SERVICES. WE ALSO NOTE THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- ASSISTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT A DELEGATION OF DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY TO DS ASKED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE CHOSEN AND WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED LOCALLY. SO ODD BEGIN ON PAGE ELEVEN WE RAISE A NUMBER OF KEY QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THAT EVALUATES THE MERITS OF THAT APPROACH PROPOSAL. A PEACH TWELVE ADJUSTER TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS ON THIS- IN THIS AREA NOTING THAT STRUCK EARLY OBLIGATION NO WOULD COMMIT THE LEGISLATURE- TOO FUNNY IN A PARTICULAR STRATEGY. EARLY ON IN IN. THE DELIBERATION OF THE BUDGET. RELATED TO THE MEDIC HELP. WILL JUST NOTE THAT THIS IN THIS I'M SPEAKING PAGE. NOW THIS IS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR USE THE MEDICAL FUNDING TO DELIVER TO THE NON MEDI CAL HOUSING RELATED SERVICES. I ALSO NOTE THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO PROPOSING A NUMBER OF CHANGES RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND SO- FOR ALL WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT TO THE GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO MAKE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA SEEMS WARRANTED AN INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MERIT CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER OUR COMMENTS REALLY FOCUSES OF THE LACK OF A COHESIVE APPROACH TAKEN OF ALL OF THE COMPONENTS TOGETHER AND CONCERNS THAT THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTATION AS A RESULT. AND SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A CLEAR STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD AS I FOR THE LATE OUT IN RECENT YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE THE MACHINE OF TAKEN A YEAR BY YEAR APPROACH AND SO NOW IN ITS THIRD YEAR IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A DEMONSTRATED INTEREST IN CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT. SO WE THINK THAT SORT OF A LOOK BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A STRATEGY THAT'S GONNA COMPREHENSIVE MOVING FORWARD IS NEEDED. AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING EARLY ACTION TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TIME SIR TO THINK THROUGH THE KEY DECISIONS AND ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF YOUR HAND OUT WITH HER. OUT TO THE AN ISSUE. RIGHT WITHIN. THROUGH THE LARGEST LONG PLAN AND I DID A CALL AND MAKE A SURE THAT SOLUTIONS ARE. WITH THE AND- FUNDING SOURCE. ARE ON THE PAGE OF THE- WHICH IS NOT THAT WE UNDER. THAT THERE IS A DESIRE. TO MAKE MOVE QUICKLY AND BRING RELIEF TO THE INDIVIDUALS- EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE AND DEVELOPING A PLAN WILL TAKE TIME. AND SO IF THERE IS A LEAD INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD WHILE THE PLAN TAKES SHAPE WE DO THINK THAT THERE COULD BE- A ONE TIME A PROPOSAL ALLOCATED THIS YEAR YOU. SEEN THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POSTS THE GOVERNOR OR SOME DIFFERENT MOUNT. USING MECHANISMS THAT ALREADY EXISTS TODAY. OF YOUR GOING. TO NEW MECHANISM AND YOU'RE SHOULD READY TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH LONG TERM. YOU TO TAKE IN YOUR QUESTION THANK. I AM I MAY START AND THEN LOOKED OTHER COMMITTEE WHO WON TO IN. I'M ALSO WITH YOUR CAR IF I MAY. LOCALS ARE MORE ATTUNED THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. WE'VE INVESTED THREE BILLION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. HOW OLD WE'VE BEEN DOING. SO THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY IN THE EARLY SAYS EARLY STAGES AND SO. WE HAVEN'T REALLY QUITE SEEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO REALLY ASSESS HOW IT'S WORKING- THEY KEEP FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE- THAT FUNDING WAS JUST MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH- IT. JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS AND SEEN THE 16% INCREASE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. ARE THE KEEP MONEY REALLY WASN'T AVAILABLE IN TIME TO REALLY MAKE REFLECTS THAT THAT JUMP IN HOMELESSNESS UP POPULATION TO THE STATE WIDE. AND WE DO KNOW THAT THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTS ARE DUE FROM CITIES AND SEE IF HE'S RELATED TO THEIR HEAT FUNDING THAT WAS JUST DUE IN JANUARY AND WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS REVIEWING TO SEE. HOW THAT'S GOING. ONE OF THE CENTRAL THEME ALSO SEEMS OF ACCOUNTABLE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AT THIS TIME. IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE THE GOVERNOR LISTED FOR. PRIORITY AREAS FOR US TO FOLLOW- I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT SO I COULD TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE. NUMBER OF NEW LEASES SIGNED NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING UNITS CONVERTED OR BUILT. NUMBER OF PEOPLE STABILIZE WITH RENT SUBSIDIES AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVED OFF THE STREETS. WOULD YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE FOR- AREAS METRICS FOR US TO EVALUATE DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY OTHERS THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADD. AND HOW REALISTIC IS IT FOR COUNTIES ARE REGION'S TO REPORT THIS TYPE OF DATA IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. SO FOR AT ANY PROGRAM WHERE STATE RESOURCES ARE BEING GIVEN TO LOCALS HAVING ROBUST MECHANISM FOR OVERSIGHT IS IMPORTANT BOTH MEASURES THAT TRACK PROGRESS BUT THEN ALSO HOLD. INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUT CONS. SO AND WE THINK THAT ANY STRUCTURES ARE MOVING FORWARD SHOULD HAVE THOSE MEASURES IN PLACE- THE MEASURE DELAYED OUT TO SOUND REASONABLE AND WE JUST THINK ANY SORT OF ROBUST- PROCESS. SHOULD BE A PART OF YOU KNOW ONGOING INVESTMENTS WILL IF THERE ARE ANY OTHERS THAT YOU ARE THE LA- THINK OF WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND- SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ADD. I WOULD ECHO WANTING THIS INFORMATION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER TO ACTUALLY FLUSH OUT THE PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I. YOU KNOW HAVE TO PUT MY BIASES OUT THERE AS WELL I SEE HOUSING HAS HEALTH. IT'S REALLY HARD TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY IF THEY'RE LIVING ON THE STREETS. AND SO I THINK THERE IS LOGIC TO. BRING IN THIS INTO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND- APPLAUDED THE GOVERNOR FOR WANTING TO. TAKE ON THIS CRITICAL OF AN ISSUE. OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS PUBLIC SERVANTS TO WORK ON IT AND SO- I'VE JUST ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING EFFECTIVE WITH THOSE DOLLARS AS WELL SO. WITH THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER THANK YOU CELESTIAL SPENT SIX THIRTY MILLION ON HALF AND THAT MONEY STILL NOT BEEN RELEASED SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO HAVE A METRIC. IF THE MONEY IS STILL SITTING THERE HAVE BEEN SPENT I AND WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN MULTI FAMILY BUILDING WAS DOWN WAS GREAT I HER A LOT. BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS YOU CAN'T SPEND YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR US TO GET HERE AND WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT I MEAN PEOPLE ARE BUILDING. THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER STATE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN. A LOT OF WORKERS ARE DOWN HERE SO THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FOR HOUSING. INCOME HOUSING YOU WANT IS A STORAGE LOCAL SCHOOL THE BAY AREA BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS A HIGHER THERE THE COMMITTEE FROM SACRAMENTO SO TO. THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA ALSO AND JUST PUSH A BUTTON. AND GO FROM THE GROUND UP THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO IT'S A DELIBERATE EFFORT AND HOW WE DO IT- AND ALSO I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE SEQUEL SOMETIMES A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT BUT- THERE'S A PROJECT HERE DOWNTOWN IT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN STORY. IT WAS MIXED USE CELL FOR WILL HOUSING IT GOT SUED. AND WITH SOMEONE SUES FOR SPEAK WITH DOCTOR FIVE YEARS FOR THE TYPICAL LAWSUIT. THAT YOU CAN BUILD AND CLIFF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPAIR. MR ALMOST COULD TALK ABOUT IT TOO- THIS IS ALL THE TIME. YEAH YOU CAN BUILD A BRAND NEW ARENA DOWNTOWN. YOU CAN CONTINUE. ON ITS COURSE. AND DRESS ISSUES THAT HAVE MERIT. BUT YOU CAN'T FOR HOW. AND WE SEE THAT TIME TIME AGAIN FOR BLOUSE MULTI FAMILY HOW. PEOPLE SUING THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST. OF THEM BEING NIMBY THAT DON'T WANT IT YOU KNOW IN THEIR BACKYARD. IN AND HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT. SO LOOK. I WOULD ASK THE LA- IS- WHAT SHOULD BE THE STATE'S ROLE IN HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION- THAT'S ONE OF THE YOU KNOW KEY I THINK THAT WE SORT OF SUGGESTED LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE DEVELOP A STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE SEEN THAT HISTORICALLY THE STATE'S ROLE HAS BEEN IN. PROVIDING RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM- YOU KNOW INVEST THAT MONEY LOCALLY AS THEY SEE FIT- THAT'S ONE OF THE DECISIONS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A NEW APPROACH ON MOVING FORWARD IF IT WANTS TO TAKE. A LARGER ROLE IN MOVING BEYOND JUST PROVIDING FUNDING PERHAPS DEVELOPING. YOU KNOW POLICY DECISIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD AFFECT. NOT ONLY TO THAT THE FUNDING BETTER WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD. A LOCAL. HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR'S. ADDRESS REGIONALS. ACCOUNT AND NOT SPREADING MONEY TO SAN. AND RESPONDING TO THE STATEMENT THAT THE SAME APPROACH DOESN'T WORK. HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM THE FRAMEWORK IN HEAT AND HAPPY SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT DOES ESTABLISH THESE REGIONAL ENTITIES ORIGINAL ADMINISTRATORS- AS ABSURD MENTIONED THE TRAILER BILL- TO THE PROBABILITY TELL ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD WORK AND SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS OF HOW IT IF THE- OBJECTIVE IS TO WORK IN A MORE REGIONAL APPROACH HOW WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND- WORK TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. OKAY I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO THE POINT THAT WITH A LOT OF MONEY HAS NOT BEEN SPENT PROBABLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER THINGS. A BILLION DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR CLOSE RESOLVED ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS ISSUE YOU CAN BUY EVERYTHING TOGETHER SO. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME GETTING A DRESSED LIKE I SAID. THIS IS BUILT UP- ALSO NO ONE TALKS ABOUT WHICH WE KEEP FOCUS ON HOUSING IN. AND HOUSING IS IMPORTANT PART BUT- IN THE MIDDLE THIS IS A CRITICAL PART. THERE'S NOT A LOT ON THAT. AND I'LL SOME PANEL TALK ABOUT LATER ON. IN REALLY ALSO SUBSTANCE ABUSE YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S HARD TO GET OFF OF DRUGS AND EVEN ALCOHOL. PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME WE RELEASE TOUR IN ARLINGTON. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED MISSION 27% FOR MENTAL ILLNESS. I WOULD SAY THAT'S NUMBERS ARE MUCH MORE. HIGHER THAN THAT. YOU KNOW IN DEALING WITH THAT AND- YOU LOOK AT SACRAMENTO. AND WELL LA IS DONE THEY PUT A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS IT THEMSELVES. AS WE SEEN REPORTS. THE RETURN WAS A VERY GOOD WITH THAT. SO LOT OF COMPLEX THINGS LITTLE BALLS IN THE AIR WITH THIS- AND GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED- TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE BUT- THERE'S A LOT TO ADDRESS. IN A IS NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY LIKE I SAID. THE JUST FOCUS ON HOUSING HOUSING HOUSING IS GOING TO. FIX A PART OF IT BUT NOT THE OVERALL CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M GONNA. PIGGY BACK ON THAT- NO MR APPS RIGHT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. THE TREATMENT SIDE AND WE KNOW THE FACTS THE GOVERNOR MENTION YOU KNOW REALLY IN A PROP SIXTY THREE AND HOW TO ADDRESS THAT AND OBVIOUSLY WILL GET AN ADULT MORE. BY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK TO SHARES DEPARTMENTS AND WE FIND OUT NUMBERS LIKE 63% OF OUR COUNTY JAILS ARE HOUSING. MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENCE BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO BUT YET NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONALIZING FOLKS- YOU KNOW ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. YOU KNOW WITHOUT ADDRESS SEEN PROP 47-57 TAKING THE TEETH OUT OF PROGRAMS LIKE DRUG COURT IN THESE THINGS. WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT'S NOT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ANY LONGER SO PEOPLE ARE OUT DOING DRUGS ON THE STREETS. IT'S AN AND NOW THEY'RE NOT BEING FORCED TO GET CLEANED UP. A IN THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOOKING AT HOW TO. PUT SOME OF THAT ENFORCEMENT PIECE BACK ON. BUT HE DIDN'T GO INTO DETAILS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE LACK OF DETAILS ON THE LACK OF THE MECHANICS THAT WE'VE GOT A WERE BOTH LEGISLATIVELY AND WITH THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS TO FIGURE OUT OKAY. HOW MECHANICALLY WE PUT THIS TOGETHER HOW TO WE SAY UP THE BEST TREATMENT. BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE SITTING IN JAIL RODDY IN. WHEN THEY NEED TREATMENT AND WE ALSO KNOW THROUGH HISTORY THAT YOU KNOW DOING THE COMMUNITY BASED OKAY YEAH YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY THEY HAVE TO GO IT TREATMENT BUT IF THEY HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM WHO SAYS ARE GONNA COME BACK WAS THE ENFORCEMENT ON THAT. SHOW REALLY GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT E GET ALL THE PIECES CORRECT ON THIS. AND AGAIN I MEAN THE. THE SUMMER COOPER KIND OF BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH ON AS IT. AND TELL FOLKS GET THE TREATMENT THAT'S NECESSARY AND GET THEM TRANSITION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND BACK INTO SOCIETY IN BACK WHERE THEY COULD BE WORKING. YOU CAN'T JUST FROM A HOUSE. IN SOME OF THE STREAMING OPTIONS ARE GONNA TAKE NO YEARS FOR SOME OF THESE FOLKS SO WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THAT TREATMENT SIDE AND YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS DEVELOP THESE HOUSES PLUS THE WORK FORCE PLUS EVERYTHING ELSE. PLUS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE ON MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO IT'S- YOU THERE'S NOT A BUTTON ARE SWITCH JUST THE PORTION IT'S MAGICALLY KANAB HERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD AND ALL THE PIECES TO GET US UP TO THAT. THAT WE'VE LOST OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES SO I KNOW THAT'S A LOT ALL AT ONCE. BUT I MEAN. WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND MAKE SURE THE MECHANICS ARE GONNA WORK. WERE EVERYTHING FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS YET AGAIN. A INTERN NOT GONNA SPEND YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS SO I MEAN AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WE LOOK IT. THE PROPOSALS I THINK WE'RE REALLY GONNA NEED. AS LEGISLATIVE BODY HELP MAKING SURE THOSE MECHANICAL PIECES FIT TOGETHER RIGHT. SO THESE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK- BECAUSE IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A PROGRAM. BUT IF IT THE MECHANICS DON'T WORK IT'S USELESS. AND AS WE'VE SEEN BEFORE. AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE CAN HAVE A PROGRAM BUT IF THERE'S NO FUNDING AND IT IS JUST AN AT THE SHELL SO IT'S A GREAT HEADLINE BUT IT DOES NOTHING. SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW IS NOT AN EMPTY SHELVES AND THE PIECES OFF IT NETWORKS SHALL. I LOOK FORWARD TO. PUTTING ALL OF THAT TOGETHER OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. SPEAKING OF PUTTING PIECES TOGETHER WE HAVE A QUORUM OF SUB ONE AND SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE ROLE FOR THAT IF I CAN. DR AMBULANCE PRESENT FRAZIER. MATHIS HATTERS. RAMOS RUBIO DOCTOR WOULD. I WOULD JUST ASK IF THERE ANY OTHER WE HAVE FOR LA- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AND THEN. SO FOR SOMEONE THANK YOUR ANALYSIS I KNOW YOU'VE COME OUT WITH THE NUMBER OF RECENT. AND PRE. APPRECIATE THAT- IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT THAT CAME OUT ON FEB ELEVENTH- BY ONE OF YOUR TOP LEVEL- CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THE PLAN RUN HOMELESSNESS LACKS COHESION IS FRAGMENTED EXCEPT FOR A AND- PART OF THE REASON WHY I KNOW THE CHAIRS OF THESE COMMITTEES PUT THIS TOGETHER IS. HOUSING IS HEALTH HEALTH IS HOUSING- BUT AS WAS JUST MENTIONED BY SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- THE DISABILITIES SAFETY NET. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM EXCEPT FOR ALL SILOS THAT WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT A BREAKDOWN. OF THE ONE ASK YOU WHETHER YOU THINK THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO AND SENT DIFFERENT POLICY COMMUNITIES AND DIFFERENT BUREAUCRACIES WITHIN GOVERNMENT TO DO BETTER WORK TOGETHER TO FOCUS ON. THE PLIGHT OF FOLKS WHO ARE HOMELESS BUT ALSO ARE INTERACTING WITH DIFFERENT POLICY SALAS ARE THERE IT OBVIOUSLY YOUR SUGGESTION IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE FRAGMENTED RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT COHESIVE. IS THERE A BETTER WAY FOR US TO AFTER THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY FOR OTHER PANELS THAT ARE COMING TO SPEAK IF ANYONE HAS IDEAS ON THIS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SYSTEM THAT. ARE HELPING. THE END OF WE WANT TO HELP BUT BE THEY'RE TO. WE'RE NOT DOING JOB I'M- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PAY IS TO MOVE THIS FOR SO LOVE IF YOU ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT. YES SIR. ARE AS HUMAN REPORT OUT THAT THERE A LOT OF FACT. THERE A NEED FOR A THREE PLAN FOR. WE HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH AS YOU SORT OF THINK THROUGH AND DEVELOP THAT PLAN WE DON'T HAVE A READY MADE ANSWERS FOR YOU TODAY ON A CREDIT HOW TO DO THAT- IT'S THOSE ARE TOUGH TRADE OFF THE DECIDING WHICH POPULATIONS TO PRIORITIZE IF YOUR- IF YOU'RE SORT OF TRYING TO FOCUS DOLLARS MORE A- MORNING. WE ARE WORKING TO THE CROSS CUTTING ANSWER TO WHAT THE TRADEOFFS OF SPREADING DOLLARS MORE THINLY MIGHT BE- THINK. HEARINGS HAVE BEEN HELD UP YOUR HELP LAST WEEK. TODAY IS OUR TO WEEKS IN THE DAYS TO COME- ARE A GOOD YOU KNOW FOR STAFF GATHERING. ABOUT WHAT THE STATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. OF IT TAKE A TOUGH TO IN THE ONE OF THE FIRST DECISIONS THE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE STATE ROLE BE LAW TERM. WILL IT CONTINUE TO BE AS. UNDER FOR DELIVERY A RESOURCE TO LOCAL LAW WHAT TAKE MORE UP. IT ROLLED FULL THAT INFORM. THE NEW. OF THE PRO. AND MUCH AND- YOU MIGHT WANT SEE IN THE FUTURE. FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOLLOWING UP ON THE LOWER ASK OF IT CERTAINLY HEARD THE GOVERNOR A STATED THE STATE TO AND TALKED ABOUT HOMELESS MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALL TALK ABOUT IN THAT LOCAL LEVEL WERE- WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE BUT YET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THOSE ARE OUT ON THE STREET. AND NOW WHERE DO WE PUT THEM AT WRITING SO I KEEP TALKING ABOUT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS AS A PLACE TO. HAVE AN OPTION FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN THEY RESPOND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS. WHEN THEY GOAL RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO COUNTY JIL OR TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN OP TO HIM TO STABILIZATION UNITS HOWEVER CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE LIMITED IN THE TIME OF DAY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SPEND THERE I THINK IT'S TWELVE DAYS. NOT SURE WHAT WE NEED IS LONGER LONG TERM CRISIS RESIDENCY TREATMENTS SO WHEN WE START TO MOVE DOWN THIS ROAD OF HOMELESSNESS AND PARTICULARLY HOT MENTAL HEALTH HOMELESSNESS OUT. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF LONG TERM RESIDENCY TREATMENT NEEDS TO BE ONE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT BECAUSE NOT WHEN FIRST WRIST TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE EPISODES THE ONLY OPTION THEY'RE GONNA HAVE IN LESS THAN INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE IS STILL A COUNTY JAILS OR THE EMERGENCY ROOM BACKING UP. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT IN THE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT'S THERE SO WE TALK ABOUT BRINGING SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER AND I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. NOT TO BE SO HASTY AND JUMPING FORWARD BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LAYING THE GROUND BREAKING IN THE DISCUSSION FOR SOME OF THESE LONG TERM APPROACH THAT WOULD BUILD SOME OF THESE CRISIS DOESN'T TREATMENTS THERE'S- LOCAL. AREAS THAT. TO THAT THAT. OF NIMBY IS A AND NOT AND BACK THIS AND THAT WELL WE KNOW THAT IT'S ENOUGH PUNISHED FOR PROP EVERY STE. I'M IN THE STATE HELLO I'M NOT FIFTY COUNTY. BUT YOU. TACKLE THAT ISSUE THAT'S NOT BE DISCUSS OF A YOU HAVE THE RESOURCE TO PUT UP Mà. WHOSE BE THE FIRST OR FOR CITIES A BUILD IT IN OUR BACKYARD THAT'S ONE OF ISSUES WE HAVE TO. WE ARE AND IN A HOME VETS AREA DOWN IN IN DECEMBER DINO AND ONE OF THE CITIES AND CEREMONIAL COUNTY. AND IT WAS EIGHTY UNITS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS BUT YET WHEN WE HAD TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS RATED BOTH FOR IT. THE IN THE MIDEAST UP AND SAID. MAYBE CALL FOR A BETTER FOR IT. WE ENDED UP LOSING THE FUNDING FOR THAT WHOLE DEVELOPMENT. SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT LOOKING AT THE SURPLUS LAND IN THE STATE. THAT COULD BE THE SOLUTION TO THE REGIONAL APPROACH THAT TAKES AWAY THAT ARGUMENT BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE TO START TO DO PEOPLE. WITH THE HOME IS METAL THAT'S OUT THERE THE HOMELESS THAT ARE OUT THERE. IN TO MAKE SURE BRING SOME TYPE OF SOLUTION TOGETHER SO I WOULD JUST BRING IT UP FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL COMING FROM THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT STRUCTURE THERE. THE FIRST PLACE THE PEOPLE END UP LOOKING AT IS COUNTY JAILS EMERGENCY ROOMS AGAIN. SO THIS ONE FOR THE MOST CHAIR. I'M LOOKING FOR ANY FUND QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE BUT- ONE TO MENTION SOMETHING ELSE CAME UP THE STATE OF THE STATE. THERE WAS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PRUDENT RESERVES WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. PRIOR BUDGET AX HAVE CAP THAT AT THIRTY THREE PERCENT. I THINK MY QUESTION FOR THE LA- NOT TO ANSWER NOW. WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE PERCENT SINCE FORTY OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY. OVER THIS 33% RESERVE. HOW COULD HE INSURE THAT THAT MONEY IS GETTING SPENT ON PROJECTS THAT MATTER AND CAN HELP IN COMMUNITIES NOW AND TODAY SO WITH THAT I'LL LOOK TO CHAIRED TING OR ANY OF THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OTHERWISE WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL ONE ONE THANK LA FOR PRESENTING. GIVE. THE SO IF WE COULD HAVE JENNER TRY. G. C. COOPER AND STAY. QUINN DAN. AND IN. CAN AFTERNOON SHARES MY JENNIFER TRY WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL. I'M SO AS WE'VE BEEN JUST THE CRY THAT WE ALL FACE WITH RISK TO THE IF. IN CALIFORNIA AND HOMELESSNESS WE'VE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT% THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE IN RECENT YEARS AND- AND ALSO AS YOU HEARD IN THE STATE OF THE STATE- THE GOVERNOR'S VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO BUILD UPON THOSE INVESTMENTS SO WHEN IT BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT- THEIR RECENT ACTIONS THAT HE TOOK ON JANUARY EIGHTH WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER- AND THEN ALSO TALK. TODAY ABOUT HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT CAME OUT ON JANUARY TENTH SO I'M JOINED BY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND STATE HOSPITALS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS- A NUMBER OF THESE INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATED WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THESE PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO BE CRITICAL PARTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE RESPONSE. IN ALL THESE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THE INTENT IS FOR THE STATE TO LEAD TO HEAR YOU ASKING ABOUT THE STATE'S ROLE AND I THINK THE WAY WE ENVISION THAT THE INTENT IS FOR THE STATE TO LEAD WITH RESOURCES AND WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND THEN TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY WHILE STILL HONORING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL PARTNERS HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I WILL FOCUS THE MOST ON THE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FUND WHICH IS A PROPOSED TO BE OPERATED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO INVEST SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THAT NEW FUND- BUT THE INTENTION HERE IS ALSO FOR THE FINE TO ACCEPT RESOURCES FROM. FEDERAL LOCAL PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT WE CAN COMBINE AND BLENDS THOSE RESOURCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THIS MODEL OF BLENDING IN LEVERAGING FUNDS SOURCES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IS ALREADY IN USE IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD. UPON THEIR SUCCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE RESOURCES IN THE FOR ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES THAT PAY RENTS AND PROVIDE TENDENCY SUPPORT SERVICES AND TO HELP STABILIZE IN PARTICULAR BOARDING CARE HOMES. THE INTENT IS ALSO FOR THE HOUSING SUPPORTED THROUGH THE FINE TO BE INTEGRATED WITH SERVICES SO THAT WE IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND HAVE LONG TERM ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO STAY OUT WEST. THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SERVED ARE ALL. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EITHER HOMELESS OR AT IMMINENT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND ALL OF THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WILL BE PROVIDED UNDER HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS YOU ALREADY HEARD- ALSO CREATES A NEW STRUCTURE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL- THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO COME FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WE WILL REQUIRE THOSE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE PROPOSED. TO HAVE X. PARTNER. WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO A CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALSO SPECIFIES THAT ALLOCATIONS IN THE REGION'S AMONG THE REGIONS- WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON POINT IN TIME HOMELESSNESS COUNTS ALONG WITH MEASURES OF RENT BURDEN. AND HOUSING NEED AND AN ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS ON RACIAL EQUITY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE FUNDS FOR EACH REGION WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH PERFORMANCE BASED CONTRACTS WITH SPECIFIC AND QUANTIFIABLE MEASURES OF SUCCESS AS THE GOVERNOR REFERENCE EARLIER TODAY AND THE CHAIR- REPEATED- BUT WE ARE WORKING TO- DILIGENTLY DEVELOP ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS BOTH THE ONES THAT WERE LAID OUT AND ADDITIONAL ONES. WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO BE INNOVATIVE AS WE CONFRONT HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA THE REGIONAL APPROACH IS INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION TO BRING ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND TO ALLOW US TO STREAMLINED OUR PROCESSES WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR LOCAL. STATIONS IF NEED. SEE THAT'S US AS THE AS WELL POSITIONED TO ADMINISTER THIS EFFORT WE OPERATE MANY OF THE STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND WE ALSO OPERATE SEVERAL EXISTING TARGETED HOUSING SUPPORT AND CLIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. SO WE. SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY REFERENCED TODAY. WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS AND WITH ALL OF YOU THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WITH RESPECT TO THIS EFFORT- SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS RIGHT ON IF YOU PREFER FOR US ALL TO GO HEAD FIRST. I THINK IF WE HEAR FROM THE PANEL ONE LAST QUESTION GREAT AND THAT'S RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON Y NAME'S JC COOPER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I AM I AM THE STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR- AT THE DEPARTMENT. SO TODAY WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THE MEDI CAL COMPONENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. ON THERE ARE NUMBER OF PIECES SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO ACROSS THE STATE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. COUNTIES MANAGED CARE PLANS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. PROVIDERS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN MEDI CAL THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES. WE HEARD A LOT FROM THAT WE CAME BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WITH THE PROPOSAL CALLED MEDI CAL HELP YOUR CALIFORNIA FOR. AND HIS CATTLE A- I'M BOB THROUGH. THE COMPLY WITH IN CASH. IN BACK I'M- THE TO THE- TODAY OF HOT NEST. ON THE- TWENTY TWO PURPLE. I'M IN CALAIS IN I WILL FILL ON THE ONE FOR THIS ITEM. SO ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING IS A STATE. BENEFIT CALLED CAN'T SCARE ME. AS THIS A FIT WAY. I'M AS HOW TOUCH IT HE YOUR MEN. SIMILAR TO CA. CASE THE INTENT IS TO. OUT FOR. COMMUNITY VOTE POP THEY SHOULDN'T. CLUE THE FOR HOME. OF HOPE THIS. BOTH THEIR MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS STATEWIDE. AND OUR HELP COMES PROGRAM WE ARE PROPOSING TO TRANSITION THOSE TWO PROGRAMS INTO NOW IS STATEWIDE MANDATORY BENEFIT. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE. I'M ST BASED SERVICES SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. YOU ALSO WILL SEE- EIGHTY- PROPOSAL FOR IN LIEU OF SERVICES OF SORRY JUST TO MENTION- THERE IS A COMMITMENT OF AN ON GOING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- BENEFIT IN THE BUDGET. FOR THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AN ANNUAL HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN LIEU OF SERVICES IS NOT A GREAT NAME- FOR THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE. I'M IT IS IT TWO OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE AN INPATIENT STAY IN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. AN E. R. AND WE HAVE A HOUSING SWEET OR BUNDLE OF SERVICES THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED TO ROLL OUT.

SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN PIECES THAT ARE. AM FOR GUARDS THE HUMMER AT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ACCOUNT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON STEPHANIE CLENDENIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF COST AND I GONNA FOCUS MY COM ON THE COMMUNITY CLASS PILAR PROJECT. THE BUDGET PER TO FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN BUDGET YOU AND A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OVER SIX YEARS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY CARE COLLABORATIVE PILOT PROJECT. THIS PROJECT IS AIMED AT DEMONSTRATING STRATEGIES TO TREAT AND HOUSE A HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS POPULATION INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE LIVING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE CYCLING IN AND OUT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IN OUR STATE HI I'M HOSPITALS. I DO FEEL IT NEED TO PROVIDE. CONTEXT IN BACKGROUND AS TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE KIND OF SHAPE THIS PROPOSAL. I'M IN SO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TREAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND- INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. AND FOUND. PORTANTINO I MENTAL ON THAT THE ERROR TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM OR THEIR UNABLE TO ASSIST IN THEIR THEIR COUNCIL IN THEIR DEFENSE SO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES ARE TREATED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IN OUR PROGRAMS AN INDIVIDUAL BILLS WHO ARE FOUND INCOME TO STAND TRIAL ON MISDEMEANOR A CHART ARE TREATED IN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. RESTORING AN INDIVIDUAL TO COMPETENT IS REALLY JUST FOCUS ON STABILIZING THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS AND- ADDRESS AND TEACHING THEM PROCESSES AND THE ROLES OF THE COURT AND THEN WHAT'S A RESTORED A COMPETENCY WE RETURN THEM BACK TO THE- COUNTY IN JAIL AND TO COURT TO PROCEED THROUGH THEIR DUE PROCESS IF IT DOES GET HARD OF. THE ERROR LINE MEANT ONUS ARE THE NATE THIS OF COMING THE DEPARTMENT. WHICH OVER THE- SENATE SIGNIFICANT IN IN THE OF AND WHO AND ROOF TO THE DEPARTMENT AND WE'VE BEEN TAKING A THE OF REALLY ENJOY A THIS BY JUST BUILDING MORE CAPACITY TO RESTORE INDIVIDUALS THE COMPETENCY TO RETURN THEM BACK TO COURT- AND THAT DOESN'T ALSO DOESN'T GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION AND FOCUS ON. GEN PROBE. I TRIED TO GET INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO COMMUNITY SETTINGS AND THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL REALLY FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM I'M IN IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND IN COMP IS STAND TRIAL MOST OF THEM HAVE A MAJOR PSYCHOTIC MOOD DISORDER AND HAD MULTIPLE PRIOR ARRESTS. MANY ARE AND SHELTERED HOMELESS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARREST- THEY'VE NOT ACCESS THEIR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- IN THE SIX MONTHS LEADING UP TO THEIR REST. AND A GOOD LOOKING OUT THEIR ARREST REPORTS REFLECTS THAT MANY OF THEIR ARRESTS ARE REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE CONDITION OF THEIR HOME THIS IN THE CONTEXT SYMPTOMS. SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO THIS VERY SPECIFIC POPULATION IN AN- THE PROPOSAL TO STOP THE SIX YEAR PILOT. ACROSS CAN. I'M OKAY COME IS THAT REFER SOME OF THE HIGH RATE OF INCOME TO AND TRY. I'M INDIVIDUALS OUR GOVERNMENT. IN COOKING THEM TO MAIN COME TO THE PROPOSAL- THE FIRST IS BY. MEANS ANI'S. DEBATE I READ. ROOMS DIVISION IS FOUND IN COMP STATE TRIAL ON FELONY TO. AND THEN THE SECOND IS PROVIDE TEAR FINANCE AND SENT TO I AM SET IN THIS DAY BEEN. FOR THE COUNTIES REACH AND- NOT ONLY THE NOW OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ULTIMATELY ARRESTED AND DEAN INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OVERALL. SO REALLY AS THE FOCUS IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE- ARRESTED. IDENTIFIES TRY TO. IMPLEMENT AND A DEMONSTRATE STRATEGIES I HAVE FOR- REDUCING THE RATE OF ARRESTS AND REPRESSIVE THIS TO A POPULATION. INCENTIVIZING BILLING A CONTINUUM OF CARE IN THE COUNTY TO TREAT THIS POPULATION AND DEMONSTRATING STRATEGIES TO ADD TO TREAT AND HOUSES POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I MAY BEGIN IF THAT'S OKAY- AND I'LL GO IN REVERSE ORDER JUST TO. ON THE TRANSPARENT EARLIER YOU WOULD ALLUDED TO THREE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST OF REFERRALS RISE TEASE WHICH THREE COUNTIES ARE THOSE. AYE WE'RE STILL IN GOOD WORKING WITH THOSE COUNTIES AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY DISCLOSE WHO THEY ARE JUST YET FAIR ENOUGH- SOME MOVEMENT TO JC PERFECT. END UP FIRST CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW POST IT'S- NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO SPENDS TIME IN THE VALLEY I BELIEVE YOUR KERN MEDICAL CENTER AND I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN. CAL CAME IN- IF I CANNOT I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY CALL IT MH SEE A- MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THE LA- HAS HELPED ME TO SURE GET THEIR IT'S EASIER. IF WE CAN JUST OF ONE ACRONYM AND STICK WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. BUT I BRING IT UP BECAUSE I'M- I THINK IT'S QUITE NOVEL AND LONG OVER DUE FOR US TO MAKE SOME OF THESE REFORMS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND- REALLY DO APPRECIATE HOW YOU'RE HELPING US TO BREAK UP MANY OF THE SILOS AND FUNDING STREAMS AND- THINK THAT THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS IN LIEU OF SERVICES WILL. HELP US TO SAVE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN- BY HELPING TO MEET PEOPLE'S. TRUE NEEDS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE- EFFORT THAT WAS PUT INTO. CRAFTING SOMETHING THIS LARGE AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS AND SO AND THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO COME BACK IF I COULD TO JENNIFER TORIA. YOU HAD ALLUDED TO A REGION EMPLOYING A BEST PRACTICE AND I THINK THAT THE- C. A. H. S. IS. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL IN LOS ANGELES AND SO WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT THERE WAS A RAND STUDY THAT WAS PER. INSTALL FOR WILL HELP PEOPLE. WHAT THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY WERE AND WHY IT'S A GOOD. EXAMPLE FOR US TO LOOK AT ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO SELECT THAT AS WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO OUR REGION WE SHOULD EXPLAIN. WHY IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE BEST PRACTICE AND NOT TO START THEIR- YEAH SO LOS ANGELES IS NOT THE ONLY- REGION IN THE STATE OR AREA IN THE STATE THAT HAS- EMPLOYED SUCH A PRACTICE I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO IN SAN FRANCISCO AND A FEW OTHERS AS WELL. EXCUSE ME ALL OF THESE JURISDICTIONS THEY WERE DOING- SOMETHINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND SOME THAT ARE DIFFERENT- SO SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES ARE THE ARE THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE FUNDING AND ALSO ANOTHER SIMILARITY- IT. IN MANY CASES THE BLENDING IN BRICK BEING OF MULTIPLE FUNDS SURCES- AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO REPLICATE- THE IDEA BEING THAT. EXCESS FULL ABOUT THOUGHT IS THAT IT ALLOWS. BOTH INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND ALSO ALLOWS TO HAVE- FEWER BARRIERS BASED ON THE RESTRICT ANY INDIVIDUAL FUND SOURCE BECAUSE YOU CAN MIX THE FUNDS AS- THIRTY INDIVIDUAL PER TING TO YEAR HAS. SEVERAL DIFFERENT NEEDS AND WHAT FUND SOURCE CAN BE UTILIZED TO MEET THAT NEED BUT ANOTHER STORY. NICE TO MEET DIFFERENT. YOU CAN MIX TOGETHER. AND SEEM TO THE- AN OR PERSON. I BUT BEHIND THIS. IS AT THE ENTITIES CAN IN NETWORK TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING THEIR NEEDS. ASSEMBLY WAY WE INTEND TO ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY AND GAP FILLING. TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF COULD ABOUT THE RAND STUDY IN WHY I THAT PANEL IT IT IT SHOULD THE RESIDENT ON. THAT EVERY DOLLAR LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THEY WERE SAVING A DOLLAR TWENTY AND- OTHER HEALTH CARE RELATED COSTS IN THE OUR VISITS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT FULLY CAPTURES AS WELL. COSTS THAT COULD BE FROM JAILS OR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON AS WELL AND SO I. LOOK TO THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE- SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT HOW WE- SPEND OUR LIMITED RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT BOTH EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE SO. WITH THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GO AHEAD JIM THIS FROM DESTROYER- SO WHERE WE CHANGING COURSE FROM FUNDING CITIES COUNTIES AND FEEL SEIZE TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FLEXIBLE FUN WITHOUT KNOWING MORE DETAILS WHO IS IN CHARGE. THE REGION'S ALSO HOW DO WE KNOW THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU GUYS SIGNED OFF ON HAPPENED LAST YEAR. WHEN HE HASN'T BEEN GIVEN OUT SO WE HAVE NO IDEA IF CAPS EFFECTIVE OR NOT AND NOW WE'RE CHANGING COURSE. SO IT'S I MEAN HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THOSE IT SO I DO I THINK YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR SAY EARLIER TODAY THAT HE BELIEVES WE STILL DO NEED TO INNOVATE AND THAT THIS IS- BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE- SAYING THAT THERE IS- HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU HAVE SUCCESS THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IF THERE'S NO SUCCESS RIGHT NOW. THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE ARE BEING INFORMATION ANYONE SPEAK FOR THE ENTITY THAT ARE ADMINISTERING THEM BUT I WILL SAY THAT- SO. ON OUR- THIS IS THE- ALRIGHT. IN FOR HE FOR EXAMPLE AND IN PRIOR YEARS AS WELL SO- IN THIS CASE WE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO USE A NEW MODEL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BE AN INNOVATION AND A NEW MODEL HAVING SAID THAT IT'S MEANT TO BUILD ON THE COLLABORATIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST SO THE FUND PURPOSES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT BUT THE LOCAL PARTNERS ARE THE SAME LOCAL PARTNER NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE- MACINNES. SO WE EXPECT THAT THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WILL COLLABORATE WITH CITIES COUNTIES CEO SEES AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES- IN SOME CASES THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS MAY BE THOSE ENTITIES- SO THAT IS NOT. A DEPARTURE OR A CHANGE IN COURSE- THE FINDING AND HOW IT FLOWS AND HOW THE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS ARE THEN. IMPLEMENTED. IT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING MONIES MISATTRIBUTED THERE NO DETAILS YET ON THAT. AND I'LL SEE HAVE HASN'T DONE THAT'S WHAT'S JUST. I MEAN IT'S A LOT OF TALK. YOU KNOW AND- BUT WE STILL HAVE NOTHING TO. SUBSTANTIAL TO MOVE HONORED TO MAKE OUR DECISIONS BASED UPON THAT. YEAH WE BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF ADDING AGAIN ANOTHER GAP FILLER SO WOULD HE BEEN HACKED AND OTHER RESOURCES DO EXIST LOCALLY WE HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS. AT THESE REGIONAL ENTITIES GOING TO NEED TO ASSESS WHAT ARE THEY ALREADY ABLE TO COVER FROM EACH OF THOSE FUNDS SOURCES AND WHAT IS MISSING. AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT ADDED HERE THEY WILL BE PRIORITIZING LOCALLY WITH THEIR PARTNERS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE FUNDS ARE BEST USED FOR SO ALL OF THE FUNDS. WILL GO TO IMPROVE AND CRITICAL YOU SIT. WITH IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. THEY WILL HAVE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM BASED ON THE STUDENTS TO ADDRESS ARE THERE ANY CHANGES TO EARLY ACTION. THERE OCCURRED AFTER THEIR- IS SO WHICH WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE DETAILS ON NEW ITEMS DISCUSSED TODAY. INCLUDING STRIKE TEAMS AND ONGOING WRAPPING SORT THIS. AT ALL APPOINT WITHIN THE EVER TALKED ABOUT AS AN ASSISTANT FUND HE'S THERE'S NO FUNDING STREAM FOR IT. AND JUST THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE I'M NOT SURE THIS APPETITE FOR A TAX INCREASE. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEEN A- REQUIRE A SUCCESSFUL MY OF MONEY. FOR REAL. AND HOW DO WE GET THERE SO THERE'S LOTS ON THAT SURE I AM SO THERE IS SOME ALLOWANCE FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND RENTAL SUBSIDIES WITHIN THE FINE BUT I THINK YOU'RE REFERENCING THE GOVERNOR'S REMARKS ABOUT THE ON GOING. RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD O WHAT HE ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OR DETAILS OF WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN I KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT BUT- WILL NEED TO- GOT. WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONTINUED WORK WITH ALL OF YOU TO FOLLOW UP ON HIS PARKS THANK YOU. WHAT THANK. I'M CONCERNING THE AT THE BOARDING CARE HOMES- THEY'RE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME MORE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON HOW YOU PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE OF THOSE FUNDS YEAH SO- AGAIN THE FUNDS THROUGH THE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES FUND WILL GO TO THEY'LL BE ALLOCATED BY REGION AND THEN REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WILL MAKE A LOCAL PLAN FOR THEIR REGION ABOUT HOW THEY INTEND TO USE THE FUNDS ONE OF THE ALLOWABLE USES IS TO USE THEM TO STABILIZE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES. WHICH IRAQ I'M- OUR DEFINITION OF BOARDING CARE FACILITIES WE ARE THE LICENSING ENTITY FOR THESE FACILITIES AS WELL AS ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY- AND I THINK WHAT WE MIGHT ENVISION FOR EXAMPLE IS AN OPERATING SUBSIDY. OR CAPITAL SUPPORTS TO COLLAPSE ONE TIME INVESTMENT- THAT MAY COME THEN WITH A RED RENTAL SET ASIDE AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW GREAT THE NEED IS TO SUPPORT THESE- IT'S IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT AN EXACT METRIC ON IT WE CERTAINLY HEAR ANECDOTALLY. THAT THERE ARE CLOSER IS AS- AND SOME OF THEM ARE CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN REGIONS AGAIN AS THE LICENSING ENTITY WE HEAR FROM OUR LEFT AND SEE SOMETIMES WHO ARE CLOSING OR WHO REQUIRE A TWO. THIS AND WE'VE HAD COVERAGE WITH THEM I YOU WILL ALSO BE. FROM SOME OF THE COUNTY FOLKS WHO HAVE RAISE THE STEP IS A CONCERN THAT DAVE'S LOCALLY AT CHAIR. OUR CONCERN AND INTEREST IN. AND DO YOU THINK IT'S FEASIBLE TO USE A PORTION OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO GIVE PUBLIC FIRST REFUSE A LARGE PURCHASE. THE IN SEASON GOING OF. I WE ALLOW WERE DID OF A FOR HOUSE AND WE DO ABOUT STABILIZING BORN HERE IS I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE BEEN QUITE SO SPECIFIC TO FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT YET WHEN WE DEVELOP OUR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND WHEN THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR SUBMIT THEIR PLANS THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT EACH OF THE ELEMENTS THAT I. DESCRIBED THANK YOU. IF WE CAN WILL DO CHAIR TING AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FIRST. SO I DON'T KNOW OF IT SO. IN A SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. MEDI CAL ARM OR TEND TO CAL. CAN WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AND- ONE EIGHT EIGHT. AN INDIVIDUAL IDT COMES INTO THE DENTIST OR THROUGH THAT THAT PROCESS THEY HAVE TO BE REFERRED BY A DOCTOR TO GET SOME SCENES. MOST INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE. TO GO TO A DENTIST HAVE TO BE GO TO ANESTHESIA. THAT'S NOT COVERED BY THE- PROCESS OF FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT FOR SOME OF THESE FAMILIES A IS THAT THAT. IN THE HEALTH COMPONENT THROUGH MEDICAL OR DENTAL I'M SO A MEDI CAL DOES COVER DENTAL ANASTASIA- TODAY AND SO WE CAN GET YOU INFORMATION- REGARDING WHAT IS OR IS NOT COVERED IN THE IN THE PROGRAM- BOTH ON CERTAIN PIECES ON THE DENTAL SIDE IN CERTAIN PIECES ON THE MEDI CAL PORTION OF THEM KERR. BONTA ARE THE HOW DID YOU INFORMATION THANK YOU ON THAT AND I WILL FOLLOW UP THE YEAH THE OTHER ONE IS THE OFTEN THE MORE THAN THE- CAL ROOM THREE. SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS LIST FOR GOING ON A YEARS. AND NEVER BE ADJUSTED ACCORDING. A WE HAVE DOCTORS THE WON'T SEE PATIENTS WHO ARE IN DIRE NEED. IN RURAL AREAS OR ANY AREA REALLY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW SERVING THE HOMELESSNESS SERVING THE IN GENERAL. BUT WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS ARE ACTUALLY JUST NOT SERVED BY BY PHYSICIANS BECAUSE THIS WILL TAKE THIS REIMBURSEMENT. WHAT PROCESSES IN PLACE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I'M SO THE DEPARTMENT- AND- WE LOOK AT IT I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'R NOT MANAGED CARE FEE FOR SERVICE SO. WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS ON THE MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM WHERE WE PAY OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS A CAPITATED RATE- IN ORDER FOR THEM TO OVERSEE THAT THE FUL BENEFIT THAT IS ON THEIR RESPONSIBILITY- BOTH THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE WOULD BE ON THAT PARTICULAR PIECE IN WHAT WE'RE ABOUT FOR THE- FOR THE HOMELESS. AND IN. WE HAVE. TOOLS THE ARE. DONE ON A SCHEDULE ARE DIFFERENT PIECES. OF SO I'M AT THE THERE IS BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTAL SERVICES. ON THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR SOME TIME I'M TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE PEOPLE OF ADEQUATE ASK ACCESS TO SERVICES WERE ALSO LOOKING AT ACCESS ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT. OUR BENEFICIARIES ARE RECEIVING ADEQUATE ACCESS TO. PREVENTIVE SERVICES- PRIMARY CARE SERVICES SPECIALTY. PUBLIC EVER IT MAY BE. IN THE DEPARTMENT CONTENT WORK ON THOSE THAT ARE. TO ARE YOU WORKING WITH. IT IS A WHOLE BECAUSE I'M SENIOR YOU SING YOUR SAID THE FEES. ARE YEARS. SETTING VIS. REIMBURSEMENTS WHAT IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MANAGED CARE SIDE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ACTUARIES IN ORDER TO SET A RATES BASED ON HISTORICAL UTILIZATION OF SERVICES- AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY REALLY SOUND TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES- AND SO WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AND TALK THROUGH- OUR RATE SETTING PROCESS WITH OUR FINANCE TEAM- BUT THAT IS THE GOAL OF THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES. I'M WE HAVE A GREAT TO BE ABLE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PROGRAM WE CENTURIES AGAIN I'M LOOKING FOR STAKEHOLDER INPUT FROM THE PHYSICIANS ARE ARE GIVERS ARE YOU WORKING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES COMPLAINING IT WOULD BE TO KNOW IF THIS FROM ON A MANAGE CARE. BETTER AND OR WHETHER IT'S- THING ON THE FIRST BESIDE. CERTAIN BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A- DIFFERENT. DEPEND ON WHICH DELIVERS SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN REGARDS TO HOW WE OVERSEE DIFFERENT PIECES- SO WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN REGARDS TO THOSE PIECES. BECAUSE ON THE MANAGED CARE SIDE IT IS A VERY KIND OF COMPLICATED RATE SETTING PROCESS WHERE- WE DO HIRE OUTSIDE ACTUARIES TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- THAT IT'S A SOUND RIGHT TO COVER. THE IN PATIENT THE OUT PAY SERVICES WHATEVER THEY ARE POSSIBLE FOR COVERING- A BET MEDIC COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEWHAT A. B. A SEPARATED SYSTEM. I'M CERTAIN P. CARTELS A MENTAL HEALTH IS. OUT SINCE USE THIS ORDER SERVICES. DOUBT DENTAL IS. OUT OF CONTRACT WAS A VARIETY OF A KIND PIECES I JUST ASK FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S HARPER US IN THIS I KNOW WHICH TYPES OF PROVIDERS FOR ME TO BE OF THE SPEAK TO THE DIFFERENT. I THINK MAGNETS. BUT WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO THROUGH WITH YOU COULD I. THE PROVIDERS I'M GOING TO VERY DEPEND ON WHICH DELIVERS. TALK. ROOM YEAH I'M LOOKING TO FIND BUT I MAY ASK ONE AS WELL SHIP AND PERSON CARE. ARE THEY DO IS IT WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM- WHAT'S DIFFERENT THE TERM THAT NOTE THAT DISAPPEAR SO AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST VALUES A WHOLE PERSON CARE IS IT REQUIRES THAT THE ENTITY BE WILLING TO TAKE ON BOTH THE MEDICAL THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THE COORDINATION OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR EVEN LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS- AND WE AS WE ROLL OUT THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT WHICH WOULD BE KIND OF ONGOING STANDARD ASIAN AND BENEFIT PART FOR- WHOLE PERSON CARE WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SERVICES INCLUDING WHAT BE. COULD BE POTENTIALLY BEING PROVIDED IT DELIVERS I'M WE HAVE A STEP OF VULNERABLE POPULATION WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR TARGET POPULATIONS WITH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DO HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS- SUBS ARE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICE ARE AND MAKE NO SAYS- SUB BRING CHRONIC DISEASES THEY MAY MARK PAUL WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH THE BAY. BASS WE DO WANT MANAGED CARE PLANS BE ABLE CONTRACT. HERE'S TO AB INBEV CARE MANAGED PROVIDER HOWEVER. THEY BE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK. OF THAT A- QUE MANAGEMENT. AND WE WILL TO CORDON ALL OF THOSE SERVICES WHETHER IT'S THE HOUSING SERVICES THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND OR THE MEDICAL SERVICES IN ADDITION TO WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. ON AND SO WE WILL BE EVALUATING WHAT IS PROVIDED IN WHETHER IT'S THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MET MHSAA TO EVALUATE AND- THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING ACROSS- VARIOUS AREAS. BUT WE ALSO WANT THEM TO BE A CRITICAL PARTNER AND PROVIDER IN THE SPACE IF IT WERE PEOPLE TELL US COMFORTABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR SERVICES. AND HELLO BEFORE- CHAIR TEEN I. WANT TO- ROAD MAP A LITTLE BIT TO WITHIN SUB ONE WE WILL BE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT. YOUR. SUPPORT SAYS WELL AS DISPARITIES ON. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION MIRRORS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE POPULATION AND- THOSE DISPARITIES NEED TO BE CALLED OUT AND- ADDRESSED EXPLICITLY IN SO- JUST LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS CHARTING. THANK YOU- JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MISS TRIED YET MENTIONED ALLOCATION BY REGION GIVE ANY SENSE ON HOW. YOU'RE GONNA PRIORITIZE FUNDING BY REGION AND- I AM THE TRAILER BILL CALLS FOR VERY SPECIFIC- AT MEASURES IN ORDER TO GET TO THOSE- ALLOCATIONS SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE POINT IN TIME COUNT FOR HOMELESSNESS IS THE SECOND ONE IS THE- BRENT BURDEN OF INDIVIDUALS AND A COMMUNITY THE THIRD IS. THE JOURNAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THEN THE FINAL ONE IS RACIAL EQUITY. I'M WHICH WERE DEFINING AS DISPROPORTION ALIKI AMONG CERTAIN POPULATIONS GREAT THANK INDEED GIVE ME I'D SINCE I. HOW MANY REGIONS ARE YOU. THINKING OUT WE HAVE NOT PUT FORWARD YET ANNE AM SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE REGIONS BUT WE ARE WORKING ON IT AND DO HOPE THAT WE CAN SHARE MORE WITH YOU SOON. OKAY THANK YOU. WHAT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ON THE REGION'S BECAUSE PART OF THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS WHAT IS THAT GOING TO LOOK LIK IS THAT CAN YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR ALSO ON ON THE BUSINESS SIDE HAS HIS WHOLE REGIONS RISE TOGETHER- INITIATIVE THAT HE'S WORKING ON SO ARE WE GONNA TIE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE THE SAME OR IS IT GONNA BE SPLIT- AND THEN. ALSO YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD MEETINGS WITH MY COUNTY. HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR IN AND THEIR TEAM. AND HOW MUCH ARE WE GONNA WORK WITH THEM WITHIN THEIR REGIONS AND YOU KNOW OF THE PLANS THAT I'M HERE IN OUR YOU KNOW. FIVE YEAR PILOT PROJECT PROGRAMS. SO. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS IS. WILL WANT TO GET A PILOT PROJECT GOING WILL WANT TO GET SOMETHING SET UP AND THEN IT'LL TAKE A YEAR TWO YEARS JUST TO HIRE THE PEOPLE STARTED. AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN HERE IS. JUST YOU KNOW WE HAVE EXISTING THINGS. EXISTING TOOLS. WHY ARE WE FIXING THE MECHANICS OF THE PROGRAM'S. TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE THAT THAT'S MY BIGGEST THING IS WE'VE GOT A LIKE I SAID EARLIER IT'S THE MECHANICS THAT GO INTO THIS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE ARE GOING TO BE THERE IN THOSE POSITIONS. THAT EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOGETHER. A AND THAT IT'S REFRESHING TO HEAR THAT WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU KNOW. DUPLICATED IN MULTIPLE PARTS BECAUSE WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER SPECIALLY IN THE HUMAN SERVICES BASIC SPECIALLY WITH OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. WHERE YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE MULTIPLE SOCIAL WORKERS WORKING WITH ONE FAMILY ON DIFFERENT PIECES INSTEAD OF ONE SOCIAL WORKER COVERING DOWN ON THE WHOLE FAMILY THE COVER EVERYTHING- A AND IT'S BEEN A CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE IS WILL YOU KNOW WHY WE HAVE SO MANY SOCIAL WORKERS WHEN WE HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER SHORTAGE. NOT GOING POSTAL WORKER PER FAMILY TAKING CARE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND REALLY OF I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GONNA HAVE- BECAUSE THESE PIECES HAVE TO FIT BUT THIS IDEA OF OKAY GREAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WILL FIVE YEARS FROM NOW HALF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE GOING TO BE OUT OFFICE. AND THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER. GOVERNOR COMING AND SELL IT'S GREAT TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD TO WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE HERE. VOIGTS WE'VE GOT I'M SURE THESE THINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER. NOW AND USE THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE NOW. AND SHARPEN THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT. WELL A LOT OF CONCERN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE AD IN FIVE YEARS WE'RE GOING TO RE EVALUATE A PILOT PROJECT. THAT DOESN'T GET THE JOB DONE NOW. ED WE'VE ONLY SEEN THANKS FOR AGGRESSIVELY GET WORSE. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THAT PIECE AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. THIS PIECE WHERE WE GET THIS 60% OF OUR COUNTY JAIL POPULATION. THAT THERE BECAUSE OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT'S NOT WHERETHEY NEED TO BE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO BE THERE THEY'RE HAVING A CONTRACT OUT THE SERVICES. WHICH ONLY INCREASES THE COST. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. BECAUSE IT IS IT IS THE LESSER CRIMES IT'S NOT. THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL NECESSARILY IT'S A WHOLE OTHER PIECE. AND THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED RE LOOKING AT PROP SIXTY THREE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND TELL WE REEVALUATE SOME OF THE CONDITIONS AND PROP WHAT'S A CRIME AS FAR AS THE DRUG SIDE GOES IN THESE THINGS GO. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT. LOOKING AT A WAY WHERE WE CAN KIND OF HOLD THEM AND FORCE THEM INTO TREATMENT. WHAT IS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE WITHOUT A CRIMINAL SIDE. THERE IS WE HAVE TO DO. IS MENTION EARLIER YOU YOU CAN'T DO A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM COME IN AND THEN GO BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING BACK INTO THE SAME POSITION. THE SAME PEOPLE AROUND THEM THAT GOT THEM INTO THE MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WITHOUT THAT TREATMENT CENTER. WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET THE HELL. N. DAD'S GOING TO BE KEY TO THIS WHOLE THING. IN IN A WE'VE SEEN A WE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS TALK ABOUT ALL THE STUDIES EVERYTHING ELSE SHOWS. YOU'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET THEM TREATMENT AND GET FOLKS BACK ON THEIR FEET. NOT JUST DROP ON BACK OFF. ON THE STREET WHERE THEY WERE WITH THE SAME MASS THAT THEY WERE AT. THE UNIFICATION CLEAN FOR SHORT PERIOD TIME THEY'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THE SAME PEOPLE THAT GOT A RELAPSE WE SEE IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING BETTER AND I'M- HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN DO THAT THIS YEAR. SO ANY COMMENTS THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY I JUST WANT CLEAR FIVE FOR THE MEDICAL PIECES THEY WON'T BE PILOTS WERE ACTUALLY TRANSITIONING FROM WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS INTO A STATEWIDE- MANDATED BENEFIT SO WOULD BE STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE AND WOULD BE MOVING OUT OF THAT KIND OF PILOT PHASE INTO A MORE SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM- SOLUTION FOR BOTH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND THE AND LOVE SERVICES SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT POINT IN REGARDS TO THOSE. I'M THAT IS ALSO TRUE FUNDED AND IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE A PILOT AND AS YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR'S- ASK OUR INTENTION IS FOR EARLY ACTION BECAUSE OUR EFFORT IS TO AS AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION. TO HAVE THOSE FUNDS AND BE READY TO HIT THE STREET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THIS SUMMER- SO WE SHARE YOUR SENSE OF URGENCY TO MOVE QUICKLY- AND WHEN WE DO FOLLOW UP WITH THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE REGION'S I THINK YOU WILL SEE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT LOOKING AT. EXISTING STRUCTURES AND RESPECTING CERTAIN BOUNDARIES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ALREADY DO EXIST AND BUILDING UPON SO. WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING MORE WITH YOU ABOUT THAT AS WELL. MR OIL FOR YOU TALKED ABOUT DSS DEVELOPING THEIR PLAN- YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES IS LEGISLATURE INCLUDING NECESSARY. AND COME BACK FOR INPUT OBVIOUSLY WERE A- PART OF FUNDING SO. THAT JUST A PLAN JUST BY DSS ONLY HERE- IT'S SO IT'S SO THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THE CREATION OF THE TRAILER BILL BUT IN ADDITION WE HAVE- SPECIFIED IN THE TRAILER BILL THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE RFP PROCESS THERE'S GOING TO BE STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS. THEY WILL INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE STAFF THERE'S ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING PLANNED FOR. NEXT WEEK- AND THEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE R. F. P. PROCESS WE WILL. WE WILL BE CONTINUING- TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. WHAT'S INTERESTING LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS KNOW WHERE OF THE ONE NEXT WEEK. I IT'S ACTUALLY AS I SAID BEING PLANNED AS IN THE INVITATIONS ARE- AT BE DRAFTED NOW AND SHOULD. BE A TIME TO YOUR STAFF SHORTLY. OKAY MANY EIGHT. THIS EXPO CREATION OF AN AGENCY. S. LOOSE LEAF WAS ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. IS A MAKES SENSE TO PLACE THIS AND SAYS. WE'LL LIST ACTUALLY CONTROLLED IN THE- HOUSE. AND ALMOST. BIRDS ARE ONE AGENCY SAID. I'M WITH RUSSIAN UP. WE THINK IT IT'S A PLACE TO CINDY FAST BECAUSE WE ALL. RATED NUMBER OF THE STAY FIFTEEN PROGRAM AND BE WE ALREADY. AN M. OF TARGET HOT HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS AND WE THINK AS AS YOU'VE SORT OF SEEN BY THIS PANEL HERE TODAY THAT IS A PART OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OTHER PIECES THAT ARE SO BEING PROPOSED THAT THERE IS AT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO BOTH THOSE HOUSING AND THE CORRESPONDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. BETTER NECESSARY TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE STABILIZED TO HEALTH THE MYSTERY BEEN PLAN ON CONSULTING EVERYTHING. UNDER ONE. ROOF I'M AT SPEAK TO THAT I KNOW THE COUNCIL IS DOING SOME WORK ON LONG TERM PLANNING. AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION. OKAY THANK YOU. HAPPY TO TRY TO GET BACK TO YOU. COUPLE FALL FALL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN- SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOMELESSNESS SO AT FIRST A QUESTION FOR DSS I KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL IS TRAVELING SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY DSS TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED BUT THERE'S NOTHING THE PROPOSAL THAT EXPLAINS HOW THE COORDINATION WOULD OCCUR COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY NOT JUST THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY DFS THOUGH THOSE ARE CERTAINLY THERE SO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT AND INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY COME TO OUR ATTENTION WHO COULD QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THE BENEFITS PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE THROUGH THE SAFETY NET SO FOR EXAMPLE SS I SS P. OR CAL WORKS AS A FAMILY- THAT THEY WOULD BE CONNECTED WITH THOSE BENEFITS PROGRAMS IF THEY NOT. ARE NOT ALREADY AND THAT THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO AND HAVE THE FAMILY INCOME AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT MIGHT HELP TO STATE IS THEM ALONG WITH THE HOUSING. BUT THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND VISION IN THE LANGUAGE ARE TENANTS THE SUPPORT SERVICES SO THAT'S HOUSING NAVIGATION. LEGAL SERVICES IS THAT MY EIGHT OUT TO RETAIN HOUSING LA LOWER. SERVICE LIKE THAT SET DSS IT'S NUMBER OF HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN TARGET. SO PERHAPS FAMILY OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN OUR IN FAMILY'S HOME PRO OR THE COW WORKS HOW SAID. PROGRAM FOR WITH CHILDREN ARE LOW INCOME. SO WE ALSO MIGHT CONNECTS PEOPLE THROUGH THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AB DEPENDING UPON THEIR NEEDS. AND THE RELATED TO THAT I KNOW- THERE LOTS OF PROGRAMS CAL WORKS FOOD STAMPS MEDICAIDOUT WHERE THERE'S AN OVERLAP BETWEEN THOSE RECIPIENTS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD BECOME HOMELESS- THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER COUNTY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR HOUSING STATUS TO SORT OF. INTEGRATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT. I'M NOT SURE IF WE'VE NECESSARILY WAITING ON THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT OF THE CONVERSATION I MEAN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO COLLECT THE DATA THAT WE CAN WE'VE TALKED THING. I SO THAT HOW IN TIME IT'S OUR A VERY IMPORTANT AS OF HOW. AT THE SAME I AM. I'M PERHAPS PERFECT AND PERHAPS THERE UNDER. AND WHAT ELSE HAVE I'M PROXY MEANT IS THAT I SOME OF GRAMM'S IN THE COUNTY SO WE WORK WITH YOU WITHIN THEIR CASELOAD TO TRY TO IDENTIFY FOLKS. I BUT ARE HOPEFUL THAT AS WE SORT OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE SPACE. FIND THAT WE WILL COLLECT TO DATE THAT IS. THAT WHEN YOU ARE AT THE OLD UP A BEAR. INSIDE. AND THE SOME SAY RISK FROM. IN OF DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE. SERVICES THAT YOU OF. BILL THAT THESE ARE INDEED. THAT ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO HOMELESSNESS AS YOU NOW ONE LAST QUESTION- I THINK MANY OF US RESTRICTED DAY BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S COMMENT THAT HE WANTS DOCTORS TO BE ABLE TO WRITE. PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOUSING- AS THE AUTHOR OF THE HOUSING OF IT FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WE HAVE- VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS. I THINK. THE QUESTION IS REALLY HOW WOULD THIS HAPPEN AND SPECIFICALLY- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CHANGES TO MEDICARE HOW WOULD REQUIRE. MANAGED PROVIDERS TO OFFER CIRCLE IN LIEU FEES LIKE RENTAL ASSISTANCE. CAPTION OCCASION CENTERS THAT THE SERVICES- HOUSING MISSING STAINING SERVICES EXCEPT TRUCK. SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENT TO SAY THAT DOCTORS DOCTOR RAMBLE IS THE WORLD. WOULD HAVE TO OR- BE CALM EXPERTS AND HOW TO NAVIGATE. HOUSING SYSTEMS HOW HOW WOULD THIS HAPPEN. HOW THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEN SHORES SO IT REALLY IS UNDER ALTHOUGH I KNOW DOCTOR. WILL BE ABLE TO FIGURE. AND I THINK IT GOES UNDER THE CA OF. FOR HEALTH SO ON IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HOMELESS I THINK IN IN MEDICAID IN YOUR SEEN THIS NATIONALLY GROWING YOU SAW THIS IN THE- IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE- AND HELP HOMES PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR QUITE SOME TIME IS THAT. ONCE YOU GET SOMEONE HOUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THEIR HEALTH BECAUSE OF THEIR HOMELESS- AND HAVE NO HOUSING IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR DIABETES OR ACTUALLY GETTING INTO TREATMENT AND SO WE DO CONSIDER. ON WE DO SUPPORT THE HOUSING FIRST A PROMISE IN MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS GET HOUSE ON A WE DO CONSIDER AT THAT OVER TIME BY INVESTING IN THINGS LIKE THE- NAVIGATION SERVICES THE DEPOSITS. ON THE SUSTAINING LIAISON SERVICES THAT OVER TIME THE ACTUAL WILL BEND THE COST CURVE IN REGARDS TO IMPROVING PEOPLE'S HEALTH GETTING I'M OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR THE INPATIENT STAY. ON WHICH ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR BUT THIRD CALL THIS IN LIEU OF SERVICES IT'S NOT THE BEST NAME BUT IT IS- BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALLS. SO I JUST KEPT LINK I DO A THAT IF WE CAN DO THAT IT'S A DEAL BUT I THINK THE IDEA OF ASKING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. I'M STILL A LITTLE HAZY ON HOW THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY. HAVE TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION IT WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHETHER. MANAGED BETTER IS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION OR POSITION SWEAT AND FIGHT SOMEONE WHO. POTENTIALLY IT. DOESN'T HAVE HOUSING RIGHT. THE TO WOULD BE COOL THING INFORMATION BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THEY WOULD A GOOD. FIT WE HAVE I'M NAVIGATORS AND OR ENHANCE YOUR MAJOR PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE IDENTIFIED IN INDIVIDUALS. BASED REFERRALS FROM WRITERS. AND OR FROM DUE TO GO OUT TO EACH BASS KIND OF OUR SERVICE THEY WOULD I. SO AND SEE A THEY'RE A GOOD. FOR HOW THINGS SEE IF ARE DUE TO BE. SOMETHING THAT TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME. I'M IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD TRUST SOMEBODY. SO IT'S A SIR THE DOCTOR HOUSE RIGHT A CAPTION HOUSE THOUGH I. THINK IT'S THE AROUND THE IDEA OF. LINKAGE BETWEEN. HOUSE. SAYS TO LOOK AT THE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE IMPACTING SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO BE WELL. OR TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ARE AVAILABLE ON FOR INDIVIDUALS THROUGH OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT MAKES SENSE OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER I JUST WANT OTHER FULL QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO HELP- THESE FOLKS HOW YOU CAN GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO ALL OF THE POPULATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HELD I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY- THIS IS THE FIRST TASK IN WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO BASICALLY MARKET THIS YEAH SO THE DEPARTMENT- STARTED ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS- AT THE END OF OCTOBER WE RELEASED OUR MASSIVE MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WE ARE- WRAPPING UP NEXT WEEK FOR MONTHS OF INTENSIVE WORK GROUP SESSIONS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN I'M GETTING A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO CONSIDER WITH THIS PROPOSAL- AND THEN WE WILL ARE WE ARE KIND OF PIVOTING. ON AFTER THAT TO KIND OF THINK THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THERE IT IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE GOAL IN REGARDS TO ROLLING OUT A STATEWIDE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M SO CREATED WHAT WE'RE CALLING TOOL KITS- THAT WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT WHERE IF SOMEONE'S BEING FROM WHOLE PERSON QUE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND OF SERVICES DOES THAT LOOK LIKE HOW TO MANAGED CARE PLANS WORK WITH PROVIDERS HE'S I'M COST. DONE TRIMS THOSE WORDS TO FOR SEVEN MOVING FROM HEALTH ALL ON INTO THAT AND WILL BE NOT DOING IS HAVING MEETING THAT WOULD BE IN APRIL AND MAY WE WOULD GO OUT IN CAN BE MANAGED CARE PLAN CAO THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS AS RIDERS WHO WOULD BE CAN TO DO THIS WORK A INFORM THEM OF THE BAY IN FORM OF A THE AFFECT OF THIS AND DE THAN COMP CASE MAY THAT DO TODAY I AND THEN WE WOULD. IDENTIFYING THOSE REGIONAL WORKS INDIVIDUAL AREAS FOR CALLING THEM TEAM ANNOUNCED TERM WHERE WOULD I DO THIS PROJECT ACCOUNTING IS HAVE TROUBLE IS PART PIECE OF AND RUNNING WE WOULD SEND IT STRIKE MEANS TO THAT AREA TO HELP A FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE OUR MEDIC THOSE AND MAKE SURE FOR SUCCESS HAPPEN UP. NIGHT IT WILL HAVE. ARE VERY COMMITTED BUT THAT IS SUCCESSFUL GIVEN THAT THE POPULATIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR SOME OF OUR MOST BOND POP TUNES. I THINK IN THAT VEIN IF YOU THINK ABOUTTHE OFFER THAT EACH ONE OF THE HAS LET'S. HAVE THROUGH OUR MAIL. OF BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT TOWARDS. BASE PARTNERING WITH THE AGE IN MAKING THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE AND FOR. ON A ON A GLOBAL YOU KNOW KIND OF YOU TALK ABOUT HOW TWENTY LEGISLATORS. BEING ABLE TO PUT THEIR MAIL OUT TO. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE POPULAR. HILL IS ANOTHER OFFER. A GOING FOR. SIR WE OR SOMETHING WE SHOULD. TALK ABOUT. SO MATHIS. WE KEEP HEARING. HOUSING FOR BUT- WHY ABOUT TREATMENT TRENDS AS I MEAN MY CAN THAT I'VE OVER AND OVER AND OVER IN THESE DISCUSSIONS BOTH BACK HOME WITH PROFESSIONALS AND THE LAST SIX YEARS HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING FIRST LET'S GET THE MENTAL HOME SO THEN WE CAN ADDRESS THE REST OF THE HEALTH. BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT WE NEED TO GET THEM THE TREATMENT AND TRANSITION THEM. FROM SOME KIND OF A TREATMENT FACILITY WHERE THEY WERE THEY'RE GETTING THE HELP ARE NEEDED. BEFORE WE PUT ON A NEW HOME. SO UNDER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE NOT YEAH THIS SCENE THAT IT'S FAIR THERE ARE- MULTIPLE LAYERS TO THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES PACKAGE- AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD WE NEED TO COME UP WITH THE DIFFERENT NAMES OF WORKING ON THAT- BUT ESSENTIALLY WE DO HAVE OPTIONS LIKE. RECUPERATIVE CARE WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS IN AN INPATIENT SETTING FOR EXAMPLE- AND INSTEAD OF THEM SITTING IN LINGERING IN AN INPATIENT SETTING FOR A LONG TIME OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHERE NO ONE'S GONNA JUST CHARGE THEM TO THE STREET GIVEN THEIR POTENTIAL. EITHER MEDICAL OR PHYSICAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION ON THAT THEY COULD TRANSITION TO A RECRUITER OF CARE. BED WHICH IS A TEMPORARY SETTING- IT DOES HAVE A THE FEDERAL MAXIMUM THE NINETY DAYS IN THAT PARTICULAR BUT IT IS A TEMPORARY SETTING TO A BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. ON GET IN IT HAS CARE MANAGER. MANAGER THERE TO WORK WITH THEM OR TO IDENTIFY WHAT TREATMENTSERVICES THEY ARE ARE NOT RECEIVING TO GET THEM LINKED UP WITH. A TEN BEHAVIOR ALL COUNTY SERVICES THEY'RE NOT ALREADY THERE OR CAN BE IN THEM IN THOSE SERVICES SO THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR PACKAGE THAT DOES LOOK AT STEP DOWN FACILITY SERVICES NOT JUST THE NAVIGATION OR THE LONGER TERM PIECES. I'M TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CAPTURE PEOPLE WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION ALSO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES FOR INSTITUTIONS OF SOMEONE WHO IS EVEN ACCESS THE- I'M IN IT TO SHOW LEVEL OF CARE BEING. CHARGED ON THEY WERE HOME PRIOR THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ALSO ASK THE TYPES OF. THE NICE ABOUT RETRIBUTIVE OR WHAT WE CALL HOSPITALIZATION SERVICES WHICH IS A THERE I'M AT ALLOWED YOU TO HAVE IT. SO BY YOU LOOKING FOR OP. GETTING THEM TREATMENT AND THEN LINKED UP WITH THOSE PIECES SO WE DO THINK TREAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL AND WE DO HAVE KIND OF TEMPORARY AND LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS THAT CAN'T USE STATEWIDE. OF I'VE BEEN. WE HAD A PAUL. PAUL ON THIS BY HOME. IN DECEMBER. WE EVERYBODY WALKED AWAY STARTED CALLING AT THE- T. BE. TREE TREATMENTFOR. THE ME THAT EDGE. P. OF THEN THEY HAVE SOME. TO GO TO THE WORD. BUT WE DEL. WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT IT A AND IF WE GET HYPER FOCUSED ON THE HOUSING. SIDE OF THINGS BUT- WE NEED SOMEWHERE FOR THE FOLKS TO GO THAT'S NOT A JAIL. TO RECEIVE THAT TREATMENT- WHETHER IT'S THAT NINETY DAY HOLD AND THEN THEY AN OPTION TO GO TO SOMEWHERE ELSE. TO FINALIZE TREATMENT IN START EDUCATION AND IN THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WILL SET THEM UP FOR SUCCESS WHAT WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW IT ADULT SCHOOL. IN TWO. B. L. A CAREER PATH IN THE TRADES OR COLLEGE OR WHATEVER. WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY START MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE- WITHOUT THAT IT'S THE AGAIN WE CAN THE FEDERAL HOUSE ADAMANT THROW MONEY AT HOME BUT INTEL WE ACTUALLY GET THAT WHOLE WRAPAROUND WHERE. OKAY YOU'RE YOU'RE SOMEWHERE SAFE. LET'S GET YOU CLEANED UP LET'S GET YOU CLEANED IF THAT'S THE ISSUE LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE OTHER UNDERLYING YOU KNOW FILL THAT ONION BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT THE OTHER UNDERLINING ISSUES ALL OUR- BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF IN AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON THE POLICY BECAUSE I HAD. BRING EVERYBODY IN. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BRING IN YOU TALK TO THE SHERIFF YOU TALK TO THE DA'S YOU TALK TO. THE SOCIAL WORKERS YOU TALK TO YOUR DEPARTMENT HUMAN HEALTH AND YOU HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE. IT'S REALLY YOU START TELLING THAT BACK AND IT'S GONE OKAY WILL OKAY WE GOTTA GET HIM CLEANED UP. IN OFF THEIR DRUG HABITS. BUT THEN THERE'S THE UNDERLINING MENTAL HEALTH. THAT LEFT OVER BECAUSE THEY GOT ON. THE DRUGS WHICH GETS IN THE WHOLE OPIOID BOMB METHAMPHETAMINE MEDIAN EPIDEMIC. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE THAT WE HAVE TO. INTO THIS IN A WORK WITH THEM AS PARTNERS ON ON WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE- THE ASSEMBLY AROUND THOSE PENSION YOU KNOW IT'S- YOU ALMOST NEED TO ENSURE THAT. WHEN AND I'VE BEEN ON THE POLICE RIDE ALONGS. WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE THE TRIAGE IS HAPPENING ON THE ROAD SIDE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR IN THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE TAKING THEM TO ANY ARE. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THAT THE WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT THERE AT THE START. BECAUSE THE I MEAN I'VE I'VE BEEN ON THE CALLS AND IT'S YOUR DRIVING AROUND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S PASSED OUT THAT YOU KNOW. ROLLED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADER THEIR LEGS ARE STICKING OUT SO THEY STOPPED TO CHECK AND SEE IF THEY'RE OKAY. BUT YOU KNOW YOU FIND OUT OKAY WELL THIS GUY'S GOT DRUGS ON THEY'VE GOT OTHER STUFF ON ON. BUT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO. RIGHT NOW BASED ON WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE SO WE'VE GOT IT THAT'S THAT STARTING PIECE. THAT WERE MISSING A PHILIP WERE WORKING BACKWARDS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S WE KEEP HEARING OUSING FIRST HOUSING FIRST HOUSING FIRST. BUT UNLESS WE START GETTING THAT TREATMENT IN THAT TRIAGE PIECE DOWN. NONE OF THE OTHER STUFF CAN ACCOUNT. THIS IS THE WICKS YEAH I JUST I JUST ECHO THAT- INTEREST THAT HOUSING FIRST AS I'VE OFTEN HEARD THAT DOES NOT MEAN HOUSING ONLY- AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT THE APPROACH THAT WE INTEND THAT WHILE HOUSING IS NECESSARY TO- PROVIDE STABILITY IN ALLOW SOMEONE TO ENGAGE IN THOSE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND THE TREATMENT THAT HEY MAY NEED IF THOSE ARE THEIR NEEDS OUR INTENTION IS FOR THE FUNDS HE HEARD THE- TO SERVICE. OTHER PLACE. TO ALLOW HOUSING AND SUPPORTS. AND IT'S NOT A US FOR ANY FINAL QUESTIONS MAY HAVE THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROB WITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THAT UP SO MEMBER.

ARE CRAP. HOW TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTALLY YOU KNOW WE URGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR SPEECH THIS MORNING OR THE URGENCY RIGHT WE'LL TALK TO. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO THIS ISSUE THE VERY WE SEE IN LA BUT IT'S NOT JUST BAY AREA ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST IN A LOS ANGELES ISSUE. IT'S IMPACTING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND FOR SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM IF TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THE- THEIR WILLING TO PUT INTO IT- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN VERY WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA- IN TERMS OF SPENDING KEEP. AND HAVE MONEY- HAD ARE YOU KNOW CAN BE CABIN SITES PROJECTS UNDER WAY- WE'VE. SIX THIRTY. YOU SHELTER. PLEA FOR. SAYING I'M THE RESOURCE THAT WE CAN PUT A THIS I.

THIS AND WE HAVE TO. I IS LEADERS OF THIS. PUTTING THOSE STORIES FIRST AND FOREMOST WE MAKE THESE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS. AND PUTTING OUR OUR OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND MAKING A REAL SERIOUS COMMITMENT. TO ENDING THIS CRISIS SO I'M HONORED TO BE WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES HERE MANY OTHERS WHO CARE ABOUT THIS. DISGRUNTLED GOOD AFTERNOON A COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND HAD CO CHAIRS THANK YOU REVEREND ME MY NAME IS PHIL AND SELLING THE DIRECTOR OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOMELESS INITIATIVE AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF AN EXTRAORDINARY MOVEMENT THAT HAS SWEPT ACROSS LOS ANGELES COUNTY OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO PREVENT AND COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. SINCE LOS ANGELES COUNTY VOTERS APPROVED A DEDICATED SALES TAX OF ONE QUARTER PERCENT IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WITH THAT SALES TAX REVENUE ALONE WE HAVE HELPED NEARLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS MOVE INTO AN ARM HAS IN AN EVER HELD NEARLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FAMILY MEMBERS AND INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ARE HOMELESS SERVICES SYSTEM HELPED DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALS MOVING TO PERMIT HOUSING. BUT I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR BRAND I'M PRESIDENT A COALITION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BECAUSE DESPITE OUR HISTORIC RABBIT LEVEL OF LOCAL REVENUES AND OUR HISTORIC EFFORTS AND OUR HISTORIC LEVEL OF SUCCESS IN MOVING PEOPLE FROM HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO LOCALLY IS INSUFFICIENT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PEOPLE PER DAY EXITED HOMELESSNESS INTER PERMANENT HOUSING LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE PER DAY. ELLEN HOMELESSNESS ACCOUNTING FOR TWELVE FOR AND- IN OUR HOME IS. WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING FINDING. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE CAN HELP ACCESS HOMELESSNESS WITH THE PRIMARY BARRIER TO DOING THAT IS FUNDING FOR RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE WITH POLICY CHANGES. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS. THE KEY ELEMENTS AS THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY OUR PRIMARY CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND UNITED WAY OF GREATER LOS ANGELES. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND HOUSING CALIFORNIA ARE. TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AN ON GOING STATE FINDING. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FROM THE GENERAL FIND ANY SORTS WILL DO AS LONG AS IT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND I'M GOING FUNDING. SECONDLY AS SOMEONE SENT YOU A GOOD DESCRIBE RECOMMENDED 55% OF THAT FINING GO JOINTLY TO CONTAIN HYMNS OF CARE AND COUNTIES AND FORTY PERCENT. TO THE THIRTEEN AT BIG CITIES THERE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED KEEPING OUT FUNDING AND THAT THAT FUNDING BE DISTRIBUTED ON A FORMULA BASIS. I'M DEPENDENT ON TWO FACTORS POINT 70% BASED ON POINT IN TIME COUNT 30% BASED. ON THE NUMBER OF RUNNERS WERE SEVERELY. RENT BURDENED. THE FINAL ELEMENT ARE PER THAT DEMAND. IS IN REAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT WE DO NOT INCLUDE. SOLVING THE BOARDING CARE CRISIS WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL. WARNING CARES- ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEEDS THE LEVEL OF CARE BORN CARE CAN PROVIDE THAT CAN PROVIDE A BORN CARE CAN BE A PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTION. BUT FOR THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM AS IN ADEQUATE RATE REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS THREATENING MASSIVE CLOSURES ARE BORN CARE FACILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE NEED A DEDICATED SOLUTION TO THAT AND ARE COUNTY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL BY THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO STAUNCH THE BLEEDING. AND ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ONGOING PLAN TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WEEK OF LOUIS CALDERON DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. I'M LOU GOVERNOR ON THE ACT IN THE DIRECTOR FOR THE GET COULD. APOLOGIA HOW LOST MY BOY YESTERDAY. CENTER THIS GARDEN OF. OUR FIFTY NINE UP WITH AND CRISIS. LAW SUPPORTING CARE LAST YEAR SAN FRANCISCO LOS A FOR YOU ABLE TO MEET MY CLOSER JUST AS I. PERFECT. TWO FIFTY SIX FIFTY SIX HOMES THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR CLANS THE LOST THEIR THEM THE THEIR HOMES- WITH HIGH COST OF LIVING AND HIGH- ACOSTA HOUSING- OPERATORS ARE SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND- PAY FOR THE BILLS ON A DAILY BASIS- THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THAT WITH THE- AT THE SIDE. PAYMENT COMPONENT AND THE PATCHES OR THE SUBSIDY THAT WE THAT WE THAT COUNTIES HAVE PROVIDING- THIS SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH TO COMPETE ON TO HIGHER FOR WORKERS LAST YEAR WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE WENT UP. WE LITERALLY HER FROM DESPERATE- OPERATOR SAYING THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD OR EVEN COMPETE WITH THEM OR FIND. WORKERS TO WORK FOR OUR FACILITY THE MINIMUM WAGE WHEN THEY CAN GET MORE WORKING FOR THE TECH COMANY DOWN THE STREET. TRANSPORTING THEIR SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT- I'M FOURTEEN MANY OF THIS SOME OF THESE FACILITIES HAVE OPT OUT. I ISSUE EVICTION NOTICE TO APPLY. AND PLAYS A- FOR SALE. BY AUGUST LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEVEN FACILITIES- IN EARLY INTENT TO CLOCK IN TO CLOSE THAT WAS WAS RESULTING IN SEVENTY ONE CLIENTS BEING THIS PLACE. WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO FOR THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE SO TEETH. SINCE DO THIS THIS PLACE CLIENTS ARE THE HEART OF OUR STORY ACTUALLY THEY ARE THE PENDANT ADULTS AND SENIORS WITH MENTAL HEALT. AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE THEM HISTORIES AND IN AND THE STRUCTURE SENDING THINGS WHERE THEY TO SEE THE BEST. BY THE TIME I DID THEY NEED THIS- BOARDING KERRY STRUCTURE SIR SETTINGS. THEY HAVE BUT LIKELY HAD MULTIPLE HOSPITALIZATIONS EXTENDED HOMELESSNESS. THEN THE HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATIONS- AND SUFFERS SOME OTHER DRAMATIC MEDICAL. CONDITION LIKE A STROKE. RENAL FAILURE OF OAK OR DIABETES. THEY ARE UP OF COLOR MAJORITY WITH LANGUAGE PLEASE AN INCREASINGLY IN THE OLDER POPULATION. THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. THERE NEED ASSISTANCE WITH MANAGING THEIR MONEY AND THEIR MEDICATIONS THEY ARE NEED A BOARDING CARE TO MAINTAIN THEIR- INSTABILITY AND BE ABLE TO GRADE A HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN. THEY RECEIVE IT M. WITH THE CLIENTS RECEIVE THIS ADDICTION NOTICE MANY OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC A KIND OF IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPENSATED ENDED UP IN THE STREETS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL- AND WE SAW THAT IN THIS LAST ROUND OF CLOSURE LAST YEAR WE LOST- ARE NOW THE ONLY PERSON THAT DECIDED TO LEAVE OR WITH BECAUSE OF THE CAR LIVING PAYMENT WAITING FOR A BET TO UP THE TO FIND IN THE IN THE COUNTY WE WERE PLANNING TO MOVE ATTY COUNTING STE G. THIS PERSON DID NOT WANT TO MOVE AT A COUNTY. SHE LEFT THE FACILITY I WAS FONG LATER IN THE STREET SHE HAD TALKED TO A SYSTEM OF CAVES SHELTERS BUT WE FIND ON THE STREET BUT HER BROUGHT HER BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A LONG STAY THERE IN FACT THESE PLAYS IN THE FILL IN THE HOME INFECTED CISCO. BUT FAILING US THE FAILURE OF US TO. DO SUPPORT THEIR HOMES BOARDING. HAS BEEN A FAILURE IN THE SYSTEM OF CARE PUT TO GET ALL ALL TOGETHER. AND THIS IS THE LAST- ISSUE THAT THE WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE VOTING CARES- THERE'S A RIPPLE EFFECT ON OUR SYSTEM OF CARE- OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE CLIENTS FROM A HIGHER LEVEL I STRUCTURE MORE RESTRICTIVE AND MORE COSTLY LEVELS OF CARE TO A MORE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE LIZ RESTRICTOR AFFECTED SUPPORT SERVICES IT'S IT GOES AWAY- WE WHEN WE DO NOT HARBORING CARES- IT MEANS THAT PATIENTS. WAITING EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME IN ACUTE BEDS HOSPITAL TO STAY THERE LONGER IN MEANS CLIENTS CANNOT STEP DOWN FROM LOCK LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WHEN THEY'RE READY ANY MEANS THAT- CLIENTS COMPLETING RESIDENTIAL DO WILL. DIAGNOSE TREATMENT OR ARMS DON'T HAVE A BOARDING CARE ABED TO CONTINUE I MAINTAINED IT NEARLY GETTING STABILITY. THAT'S SIMPLY THE SYSTEM OF CARE THE SPECTER NEEDS TO BE THERE AND WE LOSE THAT ABILITY- COUNTY HOSPITALS AND A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PARTNERS ARE PHASE WITH MAKING VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS OF THESE CHARGES CLIENTS FROM ACUTE BEDS. TO OUR SHELTER SYSTEM FROM TREATMENT BEDS TO EMERGES DEVASTATION ROOMS OR SIMPLY TO THE STREETS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM IN A STABLE SITUATION. I LIKE A BOY CARE SUPPORT HOUSING. I'M PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT TO INVEST IN A ONE TIME FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INFUSION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO TRY TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF CLOTHING OF ALL THESE A BOARDING CARES WE HAVE TO STOP THAT THAT LEGALLY CANNOT CONTINUE EVERY SINGLE YEAR LOSING THAT MANY PERMALINK BETS WITH NO LONGER BE ABLE TO REPLACE THOSE BETS. THE COST OF HOUSING BY IN THAT HOME THE COST THAT FAMILY MEMBER ALL THAT THAT ENTITY SOMETIME AGO ANONYMOUS ACOSTA MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TODAY CLEAN UP SOME OF THE BIT REGULATORY BARRIERS AND FINALLY CREATING- A COUNTIES WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THEM. AT THE STATE DESPITE LONG TERM CARE SOLUTIONS TO BUILD MORE SUSTAINABLE AND CONTINUING OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED OPTIONS FOR HOMELESS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CURATE FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS FOR THE FOR THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MICHELLE. HI GOOD AFTER CHAIRED MEMBERS MICHELLE COVERED IT UP WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE COUNTY SAFETY NET SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING SERVICES FUND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND FIRST MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO TWO ISSUES THAT LOOMS LARGEST FOR CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN GENERAL. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN UNPARALLELED LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES REFLECTED IN TODAY'S STATE OF THE STATE WHICH FOCUSED LARGELY ON THE NEED FOR THE STATE TO END HOMELESSNESS THROUGH AGGRESSIVE FOCUSED AND BOOSTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUAL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEVEL SET AN UNDER SCORE AT THE BEGINNING HERE THAT- ACCORDING TO OUR HAD STATISTICS THE VAST MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL OR LIVING WITH THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- ACCORDING TO HIDE DATA THREE FOURTHS. DO NOT HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR S. U. D. WHAT IT DOES SUGGEST IS THAT INDIVIDUALS FACING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE VERY LOW INCOME AND THE DATA ALSO TELLS US THAT THEY ARE OLDER ADULTS SO HALF OF ALL OF OUR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY AND OF THOSE HALF OF THEM ENTERED HOMELESSNESS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY- WHAT'S MOST CONCERNING IS THAT THE RESEARCHERS FIND WITH THIS AGE. IT IS THE SEVENTY. FROM A HEALTH STATUS PERSPECTIVE THERE- BODIES. LOOK FEEL OUR AND OUR EXPERIENCE THAT LIKE THAT OF A SEVENTY FIVE OR EIGHTY YEAR OLD NOT A FIFTY YEAR OLD AND SO THE MORE TIME THAT SPENT ON THE STREETS THE MORE LIKELY THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE. BOTH TO DEVELOP A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR OME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION OR TO END UP IN NEED OF VERY EXPENSIVE- HIGH COST CARE OF LIKE THAT KIND THAT LEWIS DESCRIBED IN HIS PROPOSAL- ARE CALIFORNIA CRISIS IS ALSO MARKED BY STRUCTURAL RACISM AFFECTS. AFRICAN AMERICANS INEFFICIENTLY OVERREPRESENTED AMONG INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHILE THERE ARE ONLY 6% OF OUR STATE POPULATION. ARE UP HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE PROPORTIONS ARE HIGHER IN LA. AND THIS DISPARITY MAPS ALMOST EXACTLY TO THEIR OPEN OVER REPRESENTATION IN OUR JAILS AND PRISONS WHICH I THINK IS NOTEWORTHY AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE X. INSTINCT RESTORATION AT ONE POINT IN THEIR LIVES. ARE AT MUCH HIGHER RISK OF IT. UNDERSTANDING ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WHILE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE MAJORITY THEY ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST NEEDS AND HIGHEST COST SUBPOPULATIONS. AND OF POP UP POLICY MAKERS WANT TO DO MORE TO PREVENT OLDER ADULTS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THESE GROUPS CAN OVER TIME AND THROUGH THIS TRAUMA- BECOME OUR CLIENTS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR THEM- SO WITH RESPECT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS- LIVING ON THE STREETS YES 17% HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT ALCOHOLIC CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM ARE BIG FACTORS AMONG INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN ADDITION TO OTHER- DRUG USE AND A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IS THE GROUP OF CLIENTS THAT WE WORK WITH PRIMARILY. OUR OUTREACH WORKERS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF WILL SPEND MONTHS EVEN YEARS WORKING TO BUILD TRUST WITH PEERS AND OUTREACH WORKERS THESE ARE A SOCIAL WORKERS CLINICIANS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCED IN. ENGAGING IN WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BOTH SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SO MUCH OF THIS WORK IS ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH PROP SIX FEET SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND WHEN WE ENGAGE OUR CLIENTS WE BRING THEM INTO A PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDED WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH THIS IS HIGH TOUCH CASE MANAGEMENT. LITERALLY ANYTHING OUR CLIENTS NEED TO GET THEM WHILE AND UP ON THEIR FEET INCLUDING- PROVIDING THEM WITH HOUSING GETTING THEM A GOVERNMENT ID- ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED. THESE MODELS ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO SAVE THE STATE. ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN OF WAITED HOSPITALIZATIONS IN JAIL COSTS THEY ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND DO NEED TO. TRANSITION TO HOUSING- THE GOAL FOR OUR CLIENTS IS LONG TERM RECOVERY WHICH INCLUDES POVIDING TREATMENT BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES PROVIDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING RECOVERY HOUSING RIVER WRAPAROUND SERVICES TENANTS SUPPORT. BOARDING CARE PATCHES THOSE THINGS AND THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW COUNTIES HAVE INVESTED TO DATE IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS I WOULD SAY WE ARE NOT JUST THE FRONT LINES IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE'S AND I'LL PUT LA AND SAN FRANCISCO ASIDE BECAUSE- OKAY INFANTS. HAVE GONE ABOVE AND I'M BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM ARE REALLY THE FRONT LINES IN THERE SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREETS TRYING TO ENGAGE THE BROADER ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS- THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT WE GET THROUGH PROP SIXTY THREE WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT WE'RE- WE'RE IN FOR ABOUT. HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION A U. IN SIX BRIEF THE IS SPLIT. YOUR TO OUR HOMELESSNESS WE ARE ALL LEVERAGE MEANT SERVER AFTER THE OF IN A TIONAL AND BILL DOLLARS IN I'M- HOW FUNDING. AN IS SERVICES BOTH VENTURE IN WELL AS REMAIN OUT REACHED SU TO NUTS IT'S EVERY AND BEING. WITH OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SO IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY TO DAY AND I THINK A YOU KNOW I WANT TO SORT OF LEAVE THIS GROUP WITH- AGREEMENT WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- SANTIAGO AND WICKS ARE PRESENTING WHICH IS WE'RE WE'RE DOING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE OF THE ISSUE AND REALLY TO GET UPSTREAM OF SOMEONE ENDING UP IN THAT. ONE FOURTH SUBSET CHRONICALLY ILL POPULATION- BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND OUR WAY OUT OF IT I ACTUALLY TAKE ISSUE WITH AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND OUR WAY OUT OF IT. I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK HAVE CONVERSATION ABOUT REDIRECTING FUNDS SHIFTING FRIENDS FROM THIS PRIORITY TO THAT PRIORITY BUT ULTIMATELY THERE IS MONEY THAT IS PROVEN TO BE WELL SPENT THAT-IS ON THE GROUNDS TODAY. AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED TO DO MUCH MORE TO ADDRES THE BROADER VOLUME UP THE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WHEN OUR FOLKS ARE SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE OUT THERE. THERE IS A BROADER GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED. WHO ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE BEING HOMELESS IS NOT FUN EXPERIENCE IT'S HARD AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR MENTAL. THAT PERSON IS DEALING WITH THEM THE WHOLE PROBLEMS THAT COME ALONG WITH BEING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR WITH BEING ASKED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME BECAUSE YOU CAME OUT AS- TRANSGENDER OR- CLEAR. THOSE SORTS OF MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS DO NOT MEAN THAT THAT PERSON IS SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY HAVE A PSYCHOTIC CONDITION IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE. SUFFERING HOWEVER AND SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US GIVEN THAT OUR FUNDING IS TIED TO SIR. THE MOST OF. SO TO BE OF A OR TO TRY TO FOR OTHER% SALUTE. AND OTHERS SIMPLY TO EXIST. WE THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO DO THIS ON A COMP. LEVEL WHAT DO WANT TO DO IS PICK WAS A REAL IMPORTANT PREVENTION. WHETHER IT'S RENTAL IS. OR BUILDING NEW UNITS OR DOING ANYTHING ON THE PREVENTION SIDE BOOSTING THE SS I RATES AT CENTER WE DON'T WANT TO PICK THAT AGAINST WHAT WE NEED FOR THE MOST TO Q. AND OF THE SPECTRUM. SO ONE OF OUR CAUTIONS WITH THE FLEXIBLE FUND IS ALLOWING SOME OTHER ENTITY THAT'S NOT REALLY SORT OF GROUNDED IN THE NEEDS OF. OUR SPECIFIC SUB POPULATION TO CALL IT IN TERMS OF THE BOARDING NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE I WANT TO COMPETE WITH THE RENTAL SUBSIDIES RIGHT I MEAN BOTH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BOTH ARE NECESSARY TO GETTING US OUT OF HERE SO WE EITHER THINK A DEDICATED POT OF FUNDING FOR BORDER BOARDING CARE WITHIN THE FLEXIBLE FUND. OR SOMETHING ELSE TO THIS TO SORT OF LIFT THEM LET US MAKE IT LARGER IS APPROPRIATE I ALSO WANT TO. THAT WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN TO FIVE AB INTO WHICH THE TRIAL TO. OF WITH BY THE- I'M IS SIR LINK BETWEEN SAY SERVING PURSER. WITH A THE- WITH MEANT IN. THIS HAVE SHOWN TREMENDOUS PROGRESS AND IF WE CAN INTERRUPT THOSE CYCLES WE CAN HELP ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS OVER ALL. IN ADDITION. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- OVERALL IN TERMS OF- WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS CAL AIM AT CETERA- THE EXISTING WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS FOR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE VARIED THE- ADDRESS DIFFERENT. GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND MANY OF THEM DID NOT ACTUALLY DEAL WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THEY HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE HAD OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT NOT OUR CLIENTS AND SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT- THERE ARE SOME GAPS WITH THE EXISTING WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THE CAL IN REQUIRES THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO WORK WITH THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THAT POLICY REALLY NEEDS TO BE- MOVED AND PROGRESSED TO REQUIRE COORDINATION WITH THE SPECIALTY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS WORKING WITH THOSE PEOPLE TODAY BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND WE'RE ALSO BRIEF MASTERS AT BREEDING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT MEDI CAL- DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SORT OF WORK WITH- SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WORK WITH US IN STRENGTHENING THE CAL AIM PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE POPULATIONS ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED WITHIN THAT- AND FINALLY- YOU KNOW IN THE LONG WERE RUN GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PUBLIC BEHAVIOR HOT HEALTH SAFETY NET FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AS THE GOVERNOR SAID TODAY WE HAVE HISTORICALLY UNDER INVESTED IN KING THE COMMITTEE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM- I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY POWERFUL STATEMENT ON HIS PART. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE FAILURE WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE BUT ONGOING SUSTAIN STRUCTURAL CHANGES WILL BE NECESSARY MOVING FORWARD AND WE SEEM CAP MISSILE AS THIS BUDGET PROPOSALS HAS THE BEGINNING OF THAT THANK YOU THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JAMES CAHN WRITES IN AND I'M AN EMPLOYMENT RESOURCE SPECIALIST FOR SOLANO COUNTY AND I WORK IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF SEIU TEN TO ONE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR SOLANO COUNTY FOR OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS I'VE MADE THIS MY LIFE'S WORK AND WHILE IT CAN BE EMOTIONALLY TAXING AND THANKLESS WORK. I LOVE WHAT I DO. I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. I INTERACT WITH SINGLE MOTHERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND ARE ONLY ONE STROKE OF BAD LUCK AWAY FROM LOSING IT ALL ENDING UP ON THE STREETS. AND LATELY I INTERACT MORE MORE WITH THOSE LIVING IN CARS. MOVING THEIR CARS FROM PARKING LOTS TO FREEWAY UNDERPASSES EACH NIGHT TO AVOID BEING TAGGED AS HOMELESS. JUST TWO MONTHS AGO BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS I WORKED WITH THE FAMILY WHOSE MONTHLY CASH GRANT COVERED THEIR MONTHLY RENT JUST BARELY. BUT WHEN A NEW PROPERTY OWNERSHIP GROUP BROUGHT THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEX THEY WERE SUBJECT TO RE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THAT REQUIRED THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME TO EXCEED TWO TO THREE TIMES THEIR MONTHLY RENT. WHEN THEY COULD NOT MEET THIS REQUIREMENT THE FAMILY WAS EVICTED AND THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT I WORRY FAMILY WAS HOUSE. THIS IS. FAILED WHAT I REALLY TO SAY TO YOU TODAY IS YOU HAVE A PUBLIC SECTOR WORK FORCE OUT THERE PUBLIC SERVANTS. WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO TRY TO HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. ELIGIBILITY WORKERS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES SOCIAL SERVICES WORKERS MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WORKERS LIKE ME WHO ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO DELIVER PUBLIC SAFETY NET BENEFITS IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES. TO THE HOMELESS SO USE US. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TACKLE THE- THIS HEAD ON WE NEED TO GET THOSE IN NEED. ACCESS TO PROGRAMS THAT ONLY COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES WORK WAS LIKE MYSELF CAN PROVIDE. WHEN WE DO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WERE ABLE TO CHANGE LIVESAND WEREN'T ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY THE PAIR. AND THEM ON THE PATH TO SELF SUFFICIENCY IT GIVES SOME SELF WORTH INSTABILITY. WELL WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S RECOGNITION THAT THIS CRISIS MUST BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY. AND THAT IT WILL REQUIRE AN INFUSION OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SOME OF STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT FUNDING IS FOR ONE TIME DOLLARS. RATHER THAN AN ONGOING EXPENDITURE AS WAS THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE A RELIANCE UPON OUR- COUNTY PUBLIC SECTOR SOCIALS. SAFETY NET. THEREFORE WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO. CONSIDER A SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING ALLOCATION THE STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS PROVIDING AN OUT STATIONING OF COUNTY MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AT LOCATIONS EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY THE HOMELESS AND THE HOMELESS IN SECURE. THE IDEA THAT ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE CAN GET QUALIFIED ONLY AT PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES COUNTY OFFICES IS OUTDATED AND UNREALISTIC. IT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES THAT OFTEN MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE STAND ONCE HOME BECOMING HOMELESS OR GETTING OFF THE STREETS FOR GOOD. IN THIS CASE SCENARIO COUNTIES WOULD HAVE AT THEIR DISCRETION THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THEIR OUTSTATION MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS WHERE THEY WOULD BE POSTED IN WHICH STAFF WOULD MAKE UP THAT TEAM. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE O THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. BUT ALSO FOR THE DEDICATION FOR WHICH YOU ARE TACKLING ARE STATES HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SO ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF COUNTY WORKERS REPRESENT REPRESENTED BY SEIU THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DON'T FORGET US. WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO HELP SOLVE THIS CRISIS. WE'RE WILLING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE AS SOLUTIONS ARE CRAFTED IN IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE I TO LEAVE EARLY SO- STAFFERS TO HERE AND TAKE A NOSE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS. INDIVIDUALS FOR BEING HERE AND TURN OVER TO DOCTOR RAMBLE AT. THANK YOU AND- IF I CAN I JUST ONE OF. ALSO APPRECIATE PUBLIC SERVANTS DOING GOOD WORK EACH AND EVERY DAY AND BEING ON THE FRONT LINES WHERE. IT CAN BE TOUGH TO SUFFER THROUGH VICARIOUS TRAUMA OF. BEING EXPOSED TO STORIES THAT ARE TOO REAL AND TO HUMAN. TO IGNORE. HOMELESS NESS AS AN AREA- WE WILL BE LOOKING TOWARDS UNDER ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES FIGURING OUT IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE HOME SAFE PROPOSAL AND WHETHER OR NOT LOWERING THE AGE THRESHOLD WILL ALLOW US BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE OLDER HOMELESS SPECIFICALLY AND SO WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT- I HAD A GENERAL QUESTION IF I COULD ABOUT THE PROPOSALS FROM THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS WANTED TO BE SHARED. WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE QUICK FROM THOSE WHO ARE ON THE COMMITTEE BUT- I DO WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT TO THE PERCENTAGES REGARDING CO C. AND LARGE CITIES- AND- YOU KNOW I WILL JUST. REPRESENT A LITTLE MORE OF A RURAL AREA AS WELL AS I DO RECOGNIZE FRESNO WAS ONE OF THOSE THIRTEEN LARGEST CITIES. BUT SAN JOAQUIN AND TRANQUILITY AND FOWLER AREAS THAT ALSO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS THAT. WILL NOT AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO. REPRESENT ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT I HAVE AND LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S DIFFERENT PROPOSALS HERE UP BUT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO BILLION BASICALLY WE TOOK IT IS WHAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT THAT THE WAY TO KEEP. THE STRUCTURE AND THE HAVE DOLLARS A STRUCTURED AND FOLLOWED. THROUGH THAT TRADITION BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY WORKED ON ON ON THAT AND SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A PROPOSAL BUT WE THOUGHT THE BEST PLACE TO START IS WHERE WE LEFT OFF OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND- IN IN I KNOW I DON'T NEED REMINDED BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OFF WAIT WITH HE OLLARS. IT WAS ON THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND THE CITIES AND THEN IT WAS EXTENDED LAST YEAR TO SIX FIFTY WITH THE CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE- AND SO WE FOLLOW TO WHAT IT WHAT IS NEW HERE I DON'T REMEMBER FROM THE PAST WAS THE FIVE PERCENT. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE IN CITY. HE'S A PORTION OF IT BUT THE CAN. OF CARE IS A FAR AS I AS FAR AS I. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. THE WORK ON THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY. DEFINE WHAT THAT IS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. ON IN SO IN. AN ATTIC THINK THAT'S PROBABLY LEGAL IF YOU LIKE TO ADD. JUST FOR- CLEAR THE I DO THINK HE HAS GONE OUT AND HAPPENS NOT CRAMMED SO WE'RE STRUGGLING TO. THOSE ALIGNED WITH OUR STATEMENTS OVERALL BUT JUST WANTED TO CREATE THAT. YOU KNOW THE FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY IS REGARDING YOU BOTH IN THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND HE'D FUNDING I BELIEVE. THE FINAL PERCENTAGE THAT WENT TO YOUTH WAS ROUGHLY 10% IS THERE A THOUGHT TO HAVE ENSURING THAT THERE'S ALSO A FOCUS ON THE YOUNGER SPECTRUM WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL OR IS THAT SOMETHING. TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN IN IN HALF ACTUALLY THEIR REQUIREMENT IS A MINIMUM OF 8% WITH RESPECT TO COUNTY CEO SEES AND THE BIG CITIES AND THEIR PROPOSAL THAT. IS WITH THAT WE'VE ALL PRESENTED TODAY WOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 10% OF THIS FUNDING BOTH THAT PORTION THAT WOULD GO JOINTLY TO CITIES JEFF JOINTLY TO COUNTIES AND CO SEES AND THE PERSON TO GO TO THE BIG CITIES BE A MINIMUM- ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AMONG YOUTH. IN MARCH- I YOU KNOW OF- I DON'T SITE ON THAT THAT BESIDES AS WE PLANNED INTRODUCED THE BILL SO WE CAN PLEDGE OUT SOME OF THE POLICY PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT HAD TO ADD AS YOU MAY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. BUT THAT THIS QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER THIS POLICY PIECES THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER AND WHAT THE LARGEST QUESTIONS THAT. IF I MADE A- THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO IS LIKE A HOMELESSNESS IS THE CLASSES OF OUR LIFETIME YEAH I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE BUT I'M NOT PAY. ALMOST AS IS THE CRISIS OF OUR OF OUR LIFETIME IT'S PRESENTED BEFORE US AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR STATE BUDGET WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A HOMELESS- ALLOCATION FOR I MEAN WE HAVE A- ALLOCATION FOR TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE AN ALLOCATION FOR EDUCATION WE HAVE AN ALLOCATION FOR HEALTH AND I CAN GO ON THE LINE- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ONE THAT SAYS HERE IT IS FOR HOMELESSNESS. HENCE WE'VE GOT HOMELESS OF POP CALIFORNIA- UNANSWERED RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- THIS ALLOCATION. FOR THE BUDGET AND CONVERSATION- AS- YOU CAN SEE. WILL NOW BE TAKING ACTION TODAY. BUT TO APPRECIATE- WANNA OFFER AT TIME TO. SEE IF THERE ARE ANY FINAL COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE- WE WILL THANK THIS PANEL FOR PRESENTING HERE TODAY AND MOVE ON TO A PUBLIC COMMENT- AS WE STILL HAVE A FULL ROOM I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO BE AS SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE. WHICH. THE PROJECT. HELP THE. SOME OF THE TO THE. THIS FEATURE GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW POVERTY THANKS TO THIS HEARING TODAY I THREE BRIEF COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO. HARDLY ENDORSE THE COMMENTS BY MISS CABRERA. I THOUGHT THEY WERE- SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE SHOULD REALLY TAKE TO HEART I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF TRUTH IN THAT AND I THINK. MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID I THINK SHOULD HELP GROUNDWORK THAT YOU AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO DO IN THIS BUILDING GOING FORWARD. I'M SECONDLY I WANT TO COMMEND THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. I THINK THE PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BRING FORTH IN THIS ARE VERY BOLD AND INNOVATIVE. I THINK IN PARTICULAR. HE HIS CALL FOR STAB MACHINE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL IS LONG OVERDUE. AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE WHILE WE SAW HOW EFFECTIVELY. THEY WERE ABLE TO HANDLE THE ESPY CASH OUT ROLL OUT THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB. AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT AGAIN- AND THEN THIRD I JUST WANT TO REALLY CALL OUT I THINK. SOMETHING THAT GOT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT UNDER PLAYED TODAY WHICH IS THAT- IS MA'AM. HE WE REALLY DO NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING WE REALLY NEED TO PROVIDE MORE RENTAL ASSISTANCE WE NEED PROVIDE SERVICES MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE GETTING. THE BENEFITS THAT ARE DUE TO I'M- BUT I THINK WE ALSO REAL YOU TO KEEP A FOCUS AND A SHARP EYE ON THE ISSUES AROUND PREVENTION. KEEPING PEOPLE PLAY. AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVE A HOUSE THAT WE PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA INCOME A FEW WELL. BECAUSE THE TRUE PROBLEMS CABRERA MENTION IS THE GAP BETWEEN INCOME. THE COST OF HOUSE. IT'S REALLY UP ALREADY YOU FOR GOV. AND. FORGET PATIENT. THE MAN TOOL. LONG COOL. TO BE A TO. VENT TIONS BEFORE THE OCCUR. I THINK MR AN SELL MADE THAT POINT. ELK AS FAST AS WE ARE GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS WE ARE SEEING MORE PEOPLE COME ON TO THE STREETS. SO WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB WITH THAT AND WITH THAT I'LL FINISH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AT KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF BOTH SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO MARYLAND AND RATE AT SAN FRANCISCO IS OF HARDLY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU FROM LOS ANGELES ESPECIALLY THE FUNDING AMOUNT TO BILLION DOLLARS I AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THE ALLOCATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR NEEDS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SUPPORT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN THERE I'M SURE THEY'D BE DELIGHTED TO SEE TWO BILLION A MINUTE GOT A LEAD. AND THEY DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF MANDATE OF BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE GETTING SET ASIDE RECENT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT THEY DO ALL I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR AT THAT SOME CHANGES IN THE MH TO SAY- MIGHT NEED TO HAPPEN THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTIES FUNDING LEVEL DOESN'T GO ON AS DELTA THAT BASE. MONEY WE DON'T WANT TO THAT WE FROM THE FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE GREAT THEY ALSO. VERY STRONGLY WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THE POTENTIAL NEW TOOLS RELATED TO LEVELS OF- AT. THE BILL TO USE CONSERVE. LAW AND LET CASE. THEY HAVE HIGHER HOMELESS. DAY DO A LOT I KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO ANALLY WERE MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY TODAY BUT THERE ARE OTHER COUNTIES DOING REALLY INNOVATIVE THINGS AS WELL INCLUDING SAN JOAQUIN. YUBA COUNTY WAS THE FIRST COUNTY TO USE. OF THE TINY HOMES THEY DID IT WITHOUT FANFARE AND THEY DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO- SO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ON THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE OTHER COUNTIES AS AS HIGHLIGHTED TO. SAN JOAQUIN HAS A FULL TIME STAFFER JUST WORKING ON THAT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM. YOUR PHONE WORKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH AND I JUST WANTED TO BRING- SOME STORY TO.

HAD EXPERIENCES WITH HOMELESSNESS. AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH. OUR MEMBERS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT WE CLOSE THIS GAP. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WITH HOMELESSNESS. ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY. TO EXPERIENCE AND BE A PART OF THE CHRONIC HOMELESS SITUATION WE HAVE TODAY. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO SERVING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THIS PART OF FUNDING. REALLY TACKLE THIS ISSUE. I STAND TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE SYSTEM CAN DO TO REALLY MAKE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THRIVE SO THAT THIS FUNNEL INTO CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS STOPS WE AS THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH HAS WORKED ON A. B. ZERO SEVEN- WHICH IS THE HOMELESS- YOUTH PROGRAM- GRANT PROGRAM. WHERE WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THERE TO INFORM HOW WE ARE PLANNING TO TACKLE THIS LARGER ISSUE AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REALLY CAPTURE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MD COORDINATE ENTRY SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO COUNT AND ACCOUNT. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO I SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AS SOMEONE WHO JUST GOT A CALL FROM MY DAD WHO IS NOW IN TEXAS BECAUSE HE WAS THE PLAN THIS CAR IN LOS ANGELES AND MOVED TO NEVADA CAME BACK STILL SAVES BUT SINCE IN THIS CAR AND NOW TO. NOT ONLY HAVE MY FOR BEEN IMPACTED. YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE IMPACTED BY THE OLD HOMELESSNESS SO WE GOT TO SOLVE THIS AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE AND BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THAT MEANS THEY NEED A BIGGER% INVESTMENT FROM. THE LACK OF OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT IS BEING YOU KNOW GIVE IT TO THIS THIS ISSUE THAT WE HAVE GOING ON TODAY IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM I JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THE FOURTEENTH. LARGEST AT COUNTIES IN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY- THE HUB OF THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS- IN OUR COMMUNITIES- WE SENT A LETTER TO BOTH COMMITTEES AT THAT HAS A LOT OF THINGS IN IT BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS- FIRST OF ALL. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BOTH THE HEAT AND THE HOT PROGRAM INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND OUR EXPERIENCES THAT THAT HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THOSE TWO PROGRAMS SO I THINK THAT WORK THAT- YOU ALL A AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS DID ON THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. HAS AFFECTION WAITED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS LOCALLY AND INNOVATION THAT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT. WHICH IS THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE AGAIN AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED IT VENTING PEOPLE FROM THE- HOME. WE MAY BE DOING VERY INNOVATIVE AND IMPORTANT THINGS IN ADDRESSING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN EGGS. CURRENTLY IN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO THAT CATEGORY AS WELL. AND HAVE ENCOURAGED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THERE OF COURSE WERE SUPPORTIVE- AS A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WERE PREPARED TO DO- THE WORK TO- COME UP WITH. COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO ADDRESS BOTH SIDES OF THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND- APPRECIATE. YOUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH US AS WELL. THANK YOU MA'AM. HI GOOD EVENING PERSONAL HE DOES HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES CITY MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI JUST HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THAT MR AND SELL OUTLINED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND THE GOVERNOR THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. JOSH DUGGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES FIRST RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WE JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE- PROPOSED ADDITIONAL STATE INVESTMENT. AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S INVESTMENTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THE KEEP IN THE HALF PROGRAMS- WE TRADITIONALLY. URGE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES OF. FUNDS SOURCES- BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE TODAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES FOCUS ON. AREAS THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE ARE KEY AREAS TO MAKING A MEANINGFUL PROGRESS YOU KNOW INCLUDING. RENTAL SUBSIDIES STABILIZATION OF BOARDING CARE AND- IMPROVEMENTS AND- ADDING ADDITIONAL. LOW INCOME- SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO WORK THROUGH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE- ADMINSTRATION RELATIVE TO THE CONCEPT OF REGIONS. AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS- AS WAS MENTIONED HOW. CATION STILL WEEKS ONE. WE'RE ARE. UNDERSTAND BUT TYPE PROBLEM. IS TRY. TO SOLVE TO AND PARTNER IN THAT SALUTE AS WE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. NICOLE ON BEHALF OF SEND BUTTON COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY WE WORK REALLY WELL AS A COALITION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE HEAP AND HELP FUNDING. HAVE BEEN WELL PROGRAM TO- WANT TO ECHO A COUPLE OF THE CONCERNS FROM MY COLLEAGUE AT C. SACK ABOUT REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND HOW THE REGION'S WILL BE DEFINED AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MA'AM. KAREN FOR KERRY. I'M ACCESS CALIFORNIA AND CAL VOICES- DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND WENT LIKE TO APPLAUD YOU FOR BRINGING UP YOUR SUPPORT- IT'S A IT'S I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE LET'S NOT MENTION ENOUGH. AND AS FOR THE BIG ISSUE I WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE WE ARE OBVIOUSLY. IN FULL SUPPORT OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE I THE SISTERS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES- BUT AT TO APPLIED AGAIN- WHAT MICHELLE CABRERA SAID SHE SHE WAS RIGHT ON THE COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING GREAT SERVICES NOW- TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T NECESSARILY FIT INTO THE TARGET POPULATIONS AND WE JUST WANT TO INSURE. THAT PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING SERVICES NOW AREN'T GONNA LOSE THEIR SERVICES WITH ANY CHANGES THAT TAKE PLACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. LIBBY SANTOS ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING I THINK THE MAIN THING AND ILLUSTRATED. IS THAT THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROBLEM NOR IS IT COMMON FOR A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION WE ARE. IN DESPERATE NEED OF SUBSTANTIAL- BUDGET DOLLARS TO BE ALLOCATED BUT WE HOPE THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE NAVIGATES THE US. YOU ARE VERY COGNIZANT AND EVEN WARY OF PROPOSALS THAT SEEKS TO RECREATE THE WHEEL OR INSERT ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON DIRECT SERVICES WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB- OUT IN THE STREETS WE JUST NEED. ADDITIONAL US SOCIAL WORKERS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ELIGIBILITY WORKERS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WORKERS AND WE NEED THEM OUT WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE- WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE COMMENTS MADE. FOR GUARDING OLDER PEOPLE AND THE FACT THAT A LOT OF HOMELESS ARE NOT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH SUFFERS BUT RATHER JUST POOR AND IN NEED. OF THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT OUR PUBLIC SOCIAL SAFETY MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MAR ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS AND ALL THE ADVOCATES HERE IN THE ROOM FOR EVERYONE'S ONGOING WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AND WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE MAINTENANCE OF A CARVE OUT FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY AND- TO URGE THAT THE CAR ABOUT BE AT LEAST COLLEAGUES HERE OF LAID OUT IN MORE DETAIL TODAY- WERE ALSO HERE IS A FORMER CO SPONSOR OF AB THREE ZERO SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR. AND ECHO THAT BILLS RECOMMENDATION THAT SERVICE FOR PROVIDERS BE EQUIPPED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF LGBTQ YOUTH. AND THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND WE KNOW THAT UP HOMELESSNESS IDENTIFIES LGBT Q. AND WE SEE THAT FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE- NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED ON SHELTERED YOUTH WHO ARE TRANSGENDER INCREASED BY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT- SO WE- APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THIS MORNING THAT MANY LGBTQ YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE FLEEING FROM. FAMILY REJECTION AND ABUSE- AND HIS KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THIS AFFECTS ALL COMMUNITIES- THIS WE APPRECIATED THAT WE WOULD JUST URGE T ANY LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE IMPACT OF THIS ON YOUTH IN GENERAL AND LGBT Q. USE IN PARTICULAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON LOOK FEEL OF US REPRESENTING HOUSING CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS C. S. H. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S SACK COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE- AND THE SOME OF. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THAT THE FLEXIBLE. HOWEVER WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS. NUMBER ONE WE THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE WE SHOULD WE THINK A NUMBER- TO MATCH THE SCALE OF THE NEIGHBOR BE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. ON GOING- SECONDLY WE- WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE- REGIONAL ENTITIES- WE THINK THAT THE LAST. TWO ALLOCATIONS OF KEEPING HAVE HAVE HAD TO ENCOURAGE. COLLABORATION AT A LOCAL LEVEL WE THINK ADDING AN ADDITIONAL REGIONAL S. T. COULD UNDERMINE SO THAT COLLABORATION AS WELL AS IN SOME CASES COMPETE- THIRD WE THINK HAVE THE- DSS. IT MAY NOT BE EQUIPPED NECESSARILY TO ADMINISTER HOUSING PRO DON'T DO RENTAL ASSISTANCE THEY DON'T A MASTER CAPITAL WE THINK THAT IT CITIES HCV SHOULD BE INVOLVED SOMEHOW. AND LASTLY BOARDING CARE WHILE THERE IS- OVERLAP WITH HOMELESSNESS WITHIN BOARDING CARE- IN ORDER TO. INCLUDE THE FUNDING THAT WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS- BOARDING CARE COULD POTENTIALLY CONSUME UP TO TWO THIRDS OF THE SEVEN FIFTY ALLOCATED- SO YEAH. THANK YOU SIR. I AM STILL FISHER FOR THESE BAY OF A COUPLE SUPPORT OF HOUSING COLLABORATIVE BASICALLY WE'RE OF VOLUNTEER GROUP FAKE FOCUS MAINLY ON TRYING TO FIND HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BUT NEED SUPPORT OF SERVICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE STAY THERE WHICH IS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM REALLY GLAD TO SEE ALL THE STUFF THAT TAP HERE I THINK. I THINK WE'RE WE WILL GET INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROPOSAL BUT I THINK ONE THING WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SS. STRUCTURE PER PER. BASICALLY IS THAT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOSING BOARD CARE HOMES AT A TERRIFIC RATE. AND YOU KNOW TO COUNTIES ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I KNOW ONE ALAMEDA COUNTY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND MONEY FROM THE- POP SIXTY THREE FUNDS IN ORDER INCREASES TYPE IN ALREADY FOR BOARDING CARE HOMES TO KEEP THEM FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. I THINK THE SAN FRANCISCO IS ALSO WORKING ON THIS AND THEY'RE ALSO BUYING FACILITIES AT THIS POINT THAT ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE- IS A REAL PREVENTION ISSUE HERE- TO THE EXTENT WE LOSE THESE FACILITIES THEY'RE GONE. YOU KNOW WE GOT MORE PEOPLE ON THE STREET AT THAT POINT. SO THAT THE- BEEN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF A- LOT OF POTENTIAL IN MAY BE DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL BOARDING CARE TYPE FACILITIES MAYBE ONCE RUN BY NON PROFITS INSTEAD OF PROVIDE PRIVATE FOR WRITERS. BUT WE TO DO ANY OF THAT STUFF WE GOT A REALLY WORK NOW. ON THAT AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. SHOULD BE INVOLVED RIGHT AWAY IN SAYING OKAY HERE'S WHAT WE COULD DO BECAUSE I KNOW IN OUR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE THE HOUSING DIRECTOR OF WAS ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH HOMES I TO BE STABILIZED FIRST. AND HAVE SOME STANDARD FOR WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO OTHER THAN JUST KEEP GOING. SO HE'S SOMEBODY I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL THIS WHOLE PROCESS. TO YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR I MIGHT LOSE PART TIME WITH CALIFORNIA BE OKAY MY COMMENT SHORTS BEEN A LONG DAY REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS FROM THE LEGISLATURE- ON THIS ISSUE AND ON. A FOCUSING ON THE INTERSECTIONS OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WITH WITH OTHER ISSUES. I LIKE HEALTH- WE'RE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR FUNDING THIS YEAR- WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO REVIEW THE ALTERNATE PROPOSAL BUT ARE ALSO. GENERALLY THE POSITION OF ENCOURAGING THE LEGISLATURE TO DO AS MUCH AS IT CAN. I IN IN THAT VEIN- WE'D KNOW THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED FINDS. OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR LOTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES DOES HAVE BEEN NEEDED FUNDS- BELOW WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK. ALL EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WOLD. AGREE SUFFICIENT- BUT HAVE NOT BEEN NECESSARILY LEVERAGED WITH. A COMMENSURATE POLICY CHANGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD GET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MOVING ON. BILL MORE HOW. ON MAKING SURE THAT HOUSING IF BALL. AB SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AS A- OF THIS YEAR. BODY THE- TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS SOME OF THE CHIU. THAT YOU DID PLAY HOW A FIGHT IN THE PAST. ABOUT THE UNDERSUPPLY HAPPENING IN COASTAL AREA AND IN. ABOUT A- AYE IT'S WE CAN'T. FIX SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS AT. THIS BUT- THANKS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUB SIX COMMITTEE- LAST WEEK AND- PROVIDE SOME PRELIMINARY AND PUT ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THERE IS NO OFFICIAL POSITION FROM. THE CITY AT THIS WEBER CLEARLY APPLIED THE FOCUS OF THE GOVERNOR ADMINISTRATION ON THE HOMELESS ISSUE. AND THAT THIS LEGISLATURE- YOU'VE HEARD OF. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE- THE SERVER SANTIAGO PULLS A WOOD BAT OF LA IN THE TWO BILLION- THAT OVERSEAS IS ENCOURAGING I THINK. CLEARLY WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR ONGOING SOURCES OF FUNDING- THEY'LL BE HOPEFULLY SOON I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THAT THE- THE MAILER CARTER WAS NOW CHAIR OF BIG CITY MAYORS. AND I THINK LIKEWISE OF NOT FORMULATED A- A FORMAL POSITION BUT THEY- WILL BE MEETING SOON. WITH WITH SOME OF YOU AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF TO DISCUSS THOSE. ISSUES A SORT OF WORK THROUGH A BIT. GET VERY. APPRECIATIVE TING. THUS FAR IN FOUR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE I'LL JUST TAKE A MOMENT OF I CAN THE THANKS STAFF I DON'T THINK WE DO IT ENOUGH- GENEVIEVE MORELLO'S ANDREA MARGOLIS AND NICOLE VASQUEZ THIS COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT. THREE OF YOU HERE AND JUST WANTED TO APPRECIATE YOU FOR THAT SO WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S TRYING HERE.
