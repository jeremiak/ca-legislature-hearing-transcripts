HOUSING INCLUDING EXPANSION OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAYBE VISION. AND NOTABLY THERE ARE HAVE BEEN OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS STARTED TO DATE CURRENT LEADING NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOTEL. AND MOTEL ROOMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FINALLY THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FRIENDS. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AGAIN THIS PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO PROVIDE ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION AND OR REHABILITATION OF ADULTS SENIOR CARE FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. THESE RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS ARE CRITICAL PART OF THE HOUSING CONTINUUM. FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHO HAVE NO ALTERNATIVES TO IT TO HOUSING. AND TO MEET THEIR LEVEL OF CARE IN THESE IN THESE SETTINGS. KALYAN TRIBAL GRANTEES WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULAR REPORTING TO SOCIAL SERVICES INCLUDING DATA ON THE FACILITIES IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS ACQUIRED OR REHABILITATED. THE OWNERSHIP STATUS OF THE FACILITIES THE NUMBER OF SSI RECIPIENTS START BUTTONS ALL THESE THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE SERVICES AND SUPPORT PROVIDED IN THE FACILITY SUPPORT HOUSING STABILITY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. YES THAT'S WHAT HORSEMART LICENSING FUNCTION MAINTAIN THE ROLE THAT ROLE IN THESE FACILITIES. FACILITIES THAT RECEIVE THIS FUNDING WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN COVENANTS TO CERTIFY THEIR INTENDED USE RESIDENT POPULATION AND THE LENGTH OF THE CABINETS ASSOCIATE WITH THE FACILITIES WILL BE CHEERED. BASED ON THE LEVEL. OF FUNDING AWARDED. FOR THIS PROJECT. WE ESTIMATE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXPANSION AND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESERVATION WHICH WOULD PRODUCE AROUND FIVE THOUSAND NEW BEDS AND PRESERVE OUR APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND BEDS. RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND SS I SS BE RECIPIENTS IN ADULT AND SENIOR. BEDS IN ACROSS OF THESE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO WRAP UP MORE QUICKLY- AND SUPPORT ARE AT PROGRAM ADMINISTERS. MINISTERS IN THIS EFFORT WE PLAN TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- ACROSS THE ENTIRETY OF INVESTMENTS. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE- AND I WAS HERE TO THE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION PROPOSALS AND MAY REVISION THERE ARE NUMBER AB PROPOSALS FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC POPULATE POPULATIONS INCLUDING UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND USE. OUR MIGRANT ARRIVALS ON THE BORDER COMMUNITIES AND ALSO TO SUPPORT A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS INVESTMENTS. I IN SUPPORTING THOSE. INVOLVED IN THE FINE FOR ARE SUBJECT TO THE DOCKET STATUS IN CLIENTS APPLYING FOR NATURALIZATION TO BECOME A UNITED STATES CITIZEN INCLUDING COVERAGE OF THE FILING FEES. THE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH EXISTING PROVIDERS WHO HAVE PROVEN TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DELIVER IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES. IN AN EFFORT TO BALANCE EXPANDED REACH AND ENSURING QUALITY SERVICES FOR FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS ADMINISTERED A COMPETITIVE PROCESS EACH YEAR THEN PROVIDED TECH OF CLOSE DISTANCE TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE OUT SELECTED. TO ENSURE THIS NETWORK IS EXPANDING TO ORGANIZATIONS WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED CAPACITY INVESTMENTS TO ORGANIZATIONS TO EXPAND CAPACITY SYSTEM SEPARATE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE A. T. I. COMMUNITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE INLAND AND RULE CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST CENTRAL. VALLEY AND INLAND EMPIRE. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TURN IT OVER TO CHI DEPUTY CHOI SOME ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION OR THE PROPOSEDINVEST FOR SOCIAL. THANK YOU DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS MAY REVISION. WHICH IS THE DIRECTOR POINTED OUT- PRESENTS A REALLY ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH. ECONOMIC AND RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT WERE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. IN KEEPING WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO OUR SAFETY NET TO SUPPORT MANY CALIFORNIANS ON THE PATH TO DISRUPTING POVERTY AND MEETING THEIR MOST BASIC NEEDS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORTING ECONOMIC STABILITY AND MOBILITY THAT INTEND TO CREATE BOTH A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY AND A MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY. I WILL FOCUS FIRST WITH RESPECT TO THESE INVESTMENTS ON ITEMS. THREE TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND TWENTY TWO ON YOUR AGENDA. I'M BEGINNING WITH THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AS THE CHAIR ALREADY MENTIONED WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEYS KEY PROGRAMS- FOR DISRUPTING POVERTY AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN THE MAY REVISION IS PROPOSED TO INCLUDE SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. FISCAL YEAR. THERE'S AN ANTICIPATED CASELOAD FOR THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF THREE HUNDRED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FAMILIES I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS LOWER THAN WITH ESTIMATED IN JANUARY. IN THE JANUARY BUDGET- DUE TO UPDATES WITH ACTUAL DATA BUT IT IS DOES STILL REFLECT AN INCREASE DUE TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT FEDERAL BENEFITS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WILL EXPIRE. THIS FALL. THE MAY REVISION ALSO REFLECTS A GRANT INCREASE FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS A FIVE POINT 3% AS OF OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BASED ON FUNDING AT LOCAL REALIGNMENT FUNDING. THIS EQUATES TO- A GRANT OF NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A FAMILY OF THREE AND A HIGH COST COUNTY WHICH IS 51% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDE SOME INVESTMENTS FROM FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FUND. THIS FEDERAL FUNDING PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME NON RECURRING SHORT TERM BENEFIT FOR ALL CAO WORKS RECIPIENT FAMILIES WE EXPECT TO PROVIDE AROUND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS FOR EACH FAMILY AS EARLY AS THIS JULY. TO SUPPORT THEIR- ABILITY TO PURCHASE URGENT NECESSITIES. WITH RESPECT TO CAO WORKS THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES SOME OVERPAYMENT RELATED CHANGES THE FIRST IS THE CHANGE TO HOW WE COLLECT M. OR HOW WE ESTABLISH OVERPAYMENT CLEANS. SO IF A FAMILY HAS- RECEIVED MORE ASSISTANCE THAN THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR. THIS PROPOSAL LIMITS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND COLLECTION OF THOSE OVERPAYMENTS TO- TWO YEARS BEFORE THE DATE THE OVERPAYMENT WAS DISCOVERED THIS POST BRINGS PARITY WITH THE CALFRESH POLICIES AND A GREATER- SENSE OF TIMELINESS IN FAIRNESS TO THOSE ACTIONS. THE SECOND IS OVER PAYMENT COLLECTIONS RELIEF THIS RELIEF- CLASSIFIEDS OVERPAYMENTS FROM APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH FROM APRIL THROUGH JUNE. OR THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WHATEVER IS- SOONER AS ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS THE DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES FOR A FAMILY IS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE RECOUPMENT THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN- FROM THEIR GRANTS IT WOULD BE SET AT 5% RATHER THAN CAL WORKS THE MAY REVISION REINVESTS IN INDIAN HEALTH CLINICS AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR TEN OF PARTICIPANTS ARE CAL WORKS PARTICIPANTS. FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO CAO WORKS I WOULD HIGHLIGHT ITEM THIRTEEN IN YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS AB RELATED TO SUPPORTING FAMILY REUNIFICATION. THIS ITEM WOULD PROVIDE SIX MONTHS OF ADDITIONAL CASH AID AND SERVICES FOR PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE HOME BY THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM. CURRENTLY THOSE PARENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME CONTINUED SERVICES BUT THEY'RE CASH ASSISTANCE STOPS WHEN THE CHILD IS REMOVED AND THEY'RE OFTEN DESTABILIZED. IN ADDITION TO CAO WORKS WITH RESPECT TO THE SAFETY NET THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE SOME KEY INVESTMENTS IN A GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM AND IN THE GRANTS FOR THE SSI S. S. P. PROGRAM. WITH RESPECT TO THE GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM. THE IDEA IS TO INVEST IN A NUMBER OF PILOTS ACROSS THE STATE AND- IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASING BY LOCALS IN INVESTING IN THIS AREA THIS WILL EXPAND THE EXISTING PILOTS AND WILL ALSO SUPPORTER OPPORTUNITIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF THIS CONCEPT. THE INTENT IS TO SUPPORT A PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP WHERE THIS STATE INVESTS TO INCREASE THE POOL OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE PILOTS. COUNTIES NONPROFITS AND PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS WOULD WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE PILOTS THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND WHILE SOME DETAILS WOULD BE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE IN THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED FOR THIS ITEM. MANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS WOULD BE SPECIFIED IN THE RFP PROCESS AS WE WORK TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL GRANTEES. WITH RESPECT TO THE S. S. P. PORTION OF THE SSI S. S. P. GRANTS FOR OUR ELDERS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. THE BUDGET THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND BEGINNING JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO INCREASE BY AROUND 6% THE S. S. P. PORTION OF GRANTS. THIS INCREASE COMES IN ADDITION TO A FEDERAL SSI COLA THAT WILL BE PROVIDED. IT IS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS I'M AND YOUR- AGENDA ASKS A QUESTION ABOUT ITS- ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A COLA AND ALSO AND ALSO SOME QUESTIONS HAVE COME UP RELATED TO THE CONNECTION TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. I'M THIS IS A GRANT INCREASE THIS IS NOT SPECIFICALLY A COLON. WITH RESPECT. TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AT THE TIME WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL GRANTEES AND THAT IS THE PART OF THE REASON FOR THE FOCUS HERE ON INDIVIDUAL GRANTEES. IN ADDITION THE INDIVIDUAL GRANTEES IN THE S. S. I. S. S. P. PROGRAM THEIR GRANTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPARISON TO THE POVERTY LEVEL DO NOT COVER AS MUCH AS THE GRANTS THAT ARE GRANTED TO COUPLES AT THIS TIME. B. S. S. P. PORTION OF THE GRANT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WILL BE THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT AS THE S.S. P. GRANT AMOUNT WIVES IN IN TWENTY ELEVEN. SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO SHIFT AND TALK SOME IN MY REMARKS ABOUT- INVESTMENTS IN THE MAY REVISION RELATED TO OLDER CALIFORNIANS IN ADDITION TO SSI SST. IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT RELATE TO OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES OR I H. I. S. PROGRAM. THE IHS US PROGRAM PROVIDES CRITICAL PERSONAL CARE SERVICES TO ALLOW OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO REMAIN SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES WITH THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THE 7% REDUCTION IN HOURS OF SERVICES IN THE OUT YEARS WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROGRAM A CHANGE THAT WE KNOW- YOU HAVE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PAST. IN MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES A PERMANENT BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN THE WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS- AND THOSE WHO ARE SEVERELY IMPAIRED. THIS BACKUP SYSTEM IS FOCUSED ON SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN NEED OF A REPLACEMENT OR BACKUP CARE GIVER. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A WAGE DIFFERENTIAL TO SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF THOSE BACKUP SERVICES- AND ALSO- INCLUDES A AN UPDATE TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CONTRACT RATE HE'D FOR COUNTY CONTRACT MODE SERVICES. AS SOMETIMES SHORTENED TO BE CALLED THE MASSACRE. ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE I HSS PROGRAM THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- WITH RESPECT TO EVD OR ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION- THE EBV REQUIREMENTS ARE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA MUST COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AB HAS A HAS NOTIFIED CALIFORNIA THAT WE WILL NEED TO COMPLY BY VERIFYING A PROVIDERS LOCATION FROM THE BEGINNING TO END OF SERVICE PROVISION. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THIS IN TIME SERVICE DELIVERY LOCATION AND THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS PROPOSED- CLARIFIES HOW WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH CMS REQUIREMENTS IN THE LEAST INTRUSIVE MANNER THAT IS POSSIBLE TO ADD CAPTURE AND IDENTIFY THIS. LOCATION THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES EIGHT AND INVESTMENT IN CAREER PATHWAYS- AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROVIDERS. THIS IS A PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE CARE ECONOMY THESE FINES WILL INCENTIVIZE SUPPORTS. YOUR PATHWAYS FOR HSS PROVIDERS IT WILL ASSIST THE PROVIDERS IN GAINING SKILLS TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT EITHER AS A NIGHT JUST LAST PROVIDER OR TO COMPETE FOR A HIGHER LEVEL JOB IN THE HOME CARE AND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRIES. OPPOSE ALL IN GENERAL FOCUSES ON PAID STIPENDS TO PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. REMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL HELP TO PREPARE THE WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS ANY LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR HELP WITH THINGS LIKE WORK READY NEXT OR THE TRANSITION INTO OTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH REMOTE LEARNING IN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND INTEND TO BUILD OFF OF THAT SUCCESS HERE. THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO SUPPORT ACCESS TO IN PERSON TRAINING OPTIONS THAT SUPPORT THE REMOTE LEARNING THINGS LIKE ADULT EDUCATION OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE PROPOSAL CAN ALSO SUPPORT CAREER COUNSELING AND NAVIGATION OR APPRENTICESHIP OR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PREPARATION IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. WHAT WE ANTICIPATE IS EARLY IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS IN BED TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR. WITHIN EXPANSION STATEWIDE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. FINALLY I WILL EMPHASIZE SOME KEY INVESTMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THOSE WHO ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. THE FIRST IS WITH RESPECT TO THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT OR F. S. PSA. AND OTHER PREVENTION FUNDING. FF'S PSA IS A RECENT FEDERAL LAW THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REFORMS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND ITS FINANCING PART ONE OF THE NEW FF PSA LAW AUTHORIZES SOME NEW OPTIONAL FUNDING UNDER TITLE FOR EACH OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT SO SOME NEW FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION. FOR TIME LIMITED EVIDENCE BASED PREVENTION SERVICES TO CHILDREN OR YOUTH WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE. PART FOUR OF THE NEW FF PSA LAW CREATES A NUMBER OF NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES TO FOLLOW AND PLACES LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF CONGREGATE CARE. IN JANUARY WE PROPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FFP SA REQUIREMENTS- IN THE STATE AT THERE ARE SOME CHANGES COMING BASED ON STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE FF PSA TRAILER BILL BE PROPOSED EARLIER. COMMENTS RELATED TO THINGS LIKE THE- USE OF THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR- ACCESS TO NURSING SERVICES WE ANTICIPATE THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEING THE UPDATES TO THAT CHANGE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEING MADE AVAILABLE THIS WEEK POTENTIALLY EVEN AS SOON AS TODAY. THE MAY REVISION DOES ALSO OFFER AN INVESTMENT INTO THE PREVENTION SIDE OF FF PSA AND- ALLOCATE SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT IS ADDITIONALLY AVAILABLE UNDER SOME OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTION SERVICES. I'M UNDER DE UM ARPA PROVISIONS THE STATE IS RECEIVING AROUND AN ADDITIONAL FORTY NINE MILLION ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PREVENTION PURPOSES THAT I'M REFERRING TO. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL IS A BLOCK GRANTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD IT INCLUDES AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION TOTAL FUND. A BLOCK GRANT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES THAT OPT IN TO PART ONE OF FF'S PSA AND DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION. PLANS THAT ARE APPROVED BY. HOW COUNTY'S INTEND TO EXPAND THE A PORTION OF THE ART BUT FUNDING THAT I MENTIONED WITH RESPECT TO PRIMARY PREVENTION STRATEGIES THE REMAINING ARPA FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE MORE BROADLY FOR OTHER STEEP RIGHT PURPOSES. WITH RESPECT TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WITHIN THE MAY REVISION A PROPOSAL THAT IS INTENDED TO ASSIST IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. INCLUDING THOSE WHO RECENTLY RETURNED FROM OUT OF STATE CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES- INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING TO ASSIST IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF USED IN CALIFORNIA B. ONE TIME INVESTMENT IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS TO MEET THE ACUTE AND COMPLEX NEEDS OF THESE YOUTH. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL USES OF THE S. T. R. T. P. OF ONE OR THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE MODELS. THE MAY REVISION ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES AS I MENTIONED ONGOING INVESTMENT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT. THE ASSESSMENTS EVALUATIONS CARE PLANNING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AN EXCEPTIONAL SUPPORTS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH THE MOST COMPLEX SET OF NEEDS IN FOSTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS ALSO SOME DEDICATED FUNDING FOR TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO MEETING THESE NEEDS AND THERE WILL BE A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK GUIDED BY OUR STATE IT OUR SYSTEM OF CARE STATE TEAMS TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THIS INVESTMENT OF FUNDS. AT YOUR AGENDA ASKS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE MAY REVISION INCLUDED A PROPOSAL FOR A MORATORIUM ON OUT OF STATE PLACEMENTS AT THAT IS NOT BEING PROPOSED AT THIS TIME ALTHOUGH WE DO CERTAINLY INTEND FOR THESE INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH IN CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THAT- CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM OR C. C. R. PROPOSAL- EVERY YEAR THE- ASSISTANCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN SAVINGS WITH RESPECT TO C. C. R. ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECONCILED THIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE TRUE UP OR C. C. R. RECONCILIATION. BEDS THIS SAVINGS FROM ANY ASSISTANCE COSTS ARE USED TO COVER ANY OVERAGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND C. C. R. RECONCILIATION DETERMINES THE AMOUNT. IF ANY OF ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS. STATE FUNDS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED TO YOU- COUNTIES. I'M THERE ARE IS SOME FUNDING ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION AB WITH RESPECT TO SOME C. C. R. ACTIVITIES YOUR AGENDA ALSO ASKS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING NEEDED WITH RESPECT TO RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL OR OTHER COSTS. ADDI ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT CONSIDER THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL- PROGRAM MANY OF THOSE COSTS TO BE PART OF CCR RECONCILIATION AS THE RFA PROGRAM WAS REAL LINES PRIOR TO C. C. R. AND I WILL DEFER TO MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS ABOUT M. DOT SET OF CALCULATIONS. THE FINAL THING I WILL HIGHLIGHT WITH RESPECT TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE- IS THE RESTORATION OF A NUMBER OF REDUCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN RECENT YEARS BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE- LA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE PILOT PROGRAM. THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM AND THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY RATES THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THOSE REDUCTIONS SO THEY WILL NO LONGER NEED TO BE SUSPENDED IN THE OUT YEARS- AND WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS I BELIEVE YOU WILL BE HEARING NEXT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN WITH RYAN ANDERSON. GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ALL RIGHT A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WILL BE SPEAKING BRIEFLY SO JUST TO SET UP ALL OF OUR REMARKS- FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT OF COURSE WE'RE IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF REVIEWING THESE MEN ARE VISUAL PROPOSALS. AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT WORK AND PUBLISH OUR FINDINGS AND SEND EMAILS AND OTHERWISE LET Y'ALL KNOW AND- SORT COMMENTS TODAY WILL JUST FOCUS ON OUR INITIAL POTS SOME OF THE KEY PROPOSALS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN MINISTRATION. A SECOND GENERAL NOW IS THAT WE WERE. ASKED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. IS COOLEY TO HIRE YOUR- FOR LEGISLATIVE AND- OR- IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS MAY NOT FULLY ALIGNED. WITH PREVIOUSLY STATED LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I WITH THAT IN MIND- MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON CAL WORKS- AND FIRST ONE CALVERTS CASE THOUGH. COURSE WE'RE IN THE OF REVIEWING THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASELOAD ESTIMATES ACROSS THE S. ANCE BUT I KNOW THAT. OUR EXCUSE LOGIN PARTICULARS IN AN INTEREST OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN PRODUCING MUCH LOWER FORECAST FOR THIS PROGRAM AND ADMINISTRATION- OVER THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE SOME LARGE DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES AND- UPON INITIAL REVIEW THEY APPEAR REASONABLE. STOPIT MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN OUR OFFICES BUT THEY'RE IN THE SAME BALLPARK- ALSO EDIT HEARING TO SKIP SUBCOMMITTEE EXPRESSED A PARTICULAR INTEREST. IN REVIEWING OPTIONS TO POTENTIALLY REVERSE THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN COMMERCE IS THE THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE LAST SPRING. AND ON INITIAL REVIEW OF THE MAY REVISION WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO POLICIES THAT HAVE SOME POTENTIAL TO INCREASE BY COWARDS IS THE- ALTHOUGH WE THINK IN BOTH CASES THAT POTENTIAL CASE THAT IMPACT APPEARS QUITE MODEST. THE FIRST IS THE FIVE POINT 3% GRANT INCREASE THAT IS PAID FOR BY REALIGNMENT REVENUE WELL WE ROUGHLY ESTIMATE THIS COULD INCREASE KESSLER WELL MAYBE A FEW THOUSAND CASES GENERALLY OKAY SO DOES SEEM TO INCREASE AS THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM INCREASE. THE INCREASE WOULD STILL FAR SHORT OF THE WHICH STATED AND- HISTORY GRANT 250% FAVORABLE FEDERAL POVERTY. FOR A FAMILY THAT'S ONE PERSON LARGER THAN THE CAL WORKS ASSISTANCE YOU. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES THIS IS SECOND PROPOSAL HAS SOME POTENTIAL CASE OF IMPACT. DO YOU SOME FEDERAL FUNDING TO CENTER SIX HUNDRED FORTY DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENT ALL CAL WORKS FAMILIES IN JULY. THIS BILLS OFTEN EARLIER SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENT OF SENT TO THE SAME FAMILIES LAST SPRING. WELL AS CONSTRUCTIVE THIS WOULD OF COURSE PROVIDE SOME BENEFITS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN CAL WORKS BUT WE THINK IT'S UNLIKELY. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE ANY NOTICEABLE IMPACTS ON CASE THOUGH HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME OPPORTUNITY HERE SO LEVERAGE THIS. FOR ITSBROADER CASELOAD GOALS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO. CHOOSE TO DELAY THIS PAYMENT BY A MONTH OR TWO AND COMBINE THAT WITH- IN APPROPRIATION OF. SAY A FEW MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS A STATE WIDE MOTIONAL CAMPAIGN SAYING THAT THESE BENEFITS WILL BE AVAILABLE IF YOU ENROLL IN THIS PROGRAM THAT THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE MORE FAMILIES STRUGGLE- THOSE ARE OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON CAL WORKS WITH THAT'LL BE. HANDING IT OVER. TO MY COLLEAGUE ANSHEL SHORT. THANK YOU. GOOD CHEN MEMBERS ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE- WE WILL BE PROVIDING MORE DETAILED COMMENTS IN THE COMING DAYS AS WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW MORE DETAILED INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT- BUT THERE ARE REALLY TWO KEY POINTS WHO WANTED TO RAISE THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION TODAY. REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION MAY REVISION PRO PROPOSALS WITHIN CHILD WELFARE. FIRST OF THE MAJOR VERSION PROPOSES A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION. OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. TO BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS TO ASSIST COUNTIES WITH DEVELOPING PREVENTION SERVICES IN LINE WITH. F. P. AS A PART ONE- WHICH YOU HEARD- DIRECTOR TRYING TO EXPLAIN. AND THE TIME THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOTE STATE INVESTMENT HAD BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND WE HAD FLAG THIS AS A KEY AREA THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING FOR COUNTIES. IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS PREVENTION SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE- WELL WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE DETAILS OF THIS NEAR VISION PROPOSAL IT DOES SEEM. ODD THAT THIS MAKES SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD THIS RECOMMENDATION. AND SECOND THERE MAY REVISION CONTINUES SOME SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION RELATED TO PANDEMIC RESPONSE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE- THESE INCLUDE FUNDING FOR SUCH THINGS AS FLEXIBILITY IS AN EXPANSION FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS- TECHNOLOGY AND HOTLINE FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND FAMILIES. ONE NO WE WOULD MAKE IS THAT- EIGHT GAP REMAINS IN TERMS OF A LACK OF FUNDING FOR ALL RESOURCE FAMILIES AS WELL AS FOR A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM FOR S. T. R. T. P. PROVIDERS. AND AS WE RAISED AT THE TIME OF THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC YOU'VE CARE GIVERS HAVE BEEN FACING INCREASED COST PRESSURES SUCH AS FOR FOOD. AND HAVE ALSO BEEN NAVIGATING THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES OF STAY AT HOME ORDERS NOW WITH THE YOUTH IN THEIR CARE FOR EXAMPLE CHALLENGES AROUND VIRTUAL LEARNING. AND LACK OF ACCESS TO CHILD CARE. THEREFORE WE CONTINUE TO FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE- THAT IT MAY WISH TO PROVIDE STIPENDS OR SOME OTHER DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO ALL FOSTER CARE PROVIDERS AS PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL CORPORATE NINETEEN FISCAL RELIEF EFFORTS WITHIN CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE. AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JACKI BRAZIL FOR COMMENT ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S I H. S. S. AND AT THE SITE AT THE P. PROPOSAL. JACKIE BRINGS YOU WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. MY COMMENTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON HIGHLIGHTING SPECIFIC AGING PROPOSALS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT IS. THAT ONE RAISE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION OR MAY NOT FULLY ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. A ONE EXAMPLE THAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE IN THE AGENDA OF THE S. P. GREAT INCREASE PROPOSAL. FOR ADDITIONAL CONTACTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. S. S. P. RECIPIENTS EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF GREAT REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN A STEADY DECLINE OF THE GRANT AMOUNTS. TO THE POINT THAT THE GRADES REACHED A FEDERALLY ALLOWABLE MINIMUM. LEVELS BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. SAN THEN THE STATE. A SLOW AS AS P. GREAT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. ADDITIONALLY AS A PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED INTENT LANGUAGE TO ONCE AGAIN PROVIDE ESSES P. GRANT- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND. AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ALSO SUCKS OF GOAL OF BRINGING AS A SCIENCE IS P. GRANTS UP TO THE ELDER ECONOMIC INDEX AND FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE. NOW CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS EFFECTIVELY PROPOSING TO INCREASE S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUALS ONLY BY ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED GREAT INCREASE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT ALTERNATELY DOES NOT PROVIDE THOSE FUTURE COLAS I'M PER LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGE OR INCREASE GRANTS TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AS MENTIONED IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE PROPOSED INCREASE RETURNS GRANTS TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LET THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LEVELS MOST OF THE PRIOR REDUCTIONS ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ESPECIALLY FOR COUPLES. AND BASED ON OUR ROUGH CALCULATION INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL AT A LOWER LEVEL RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE AND THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AGAIN WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL GREAT INCREASE IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WITH REGARD TO THOSE BROADER GOALS OF INCREASING THE S. S. P. GRANTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD PICK A DIFFERENT GRANT GRANT BENCHMARK IF IT WANTED TO RESTORE LET'S SAY A GREATER SHARE OF THE PAST JUSTICE P. REDUCTIONS OR GET INDIVIDUALS CLOSER TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND A BROADER POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO REDUCE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET IN ITS TOTALITY WELL THE ADMINISTRATION IS DIRECTING RESOURCES TO PROP UP NEW SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVENTIONS- WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT SAME LEVEL OF AUGMENTATION. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE ISIS ISIS P. GRAMS. THE LAST ISSUE BUT I WILL TO COMMON ON IS THIS NUMBER TWO. THE LONG TERM CARE PATHWAYS PROPOSAL. JUST TO RAISE POSSIBILITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND AGAIN FOR CONTACT THE CONCEPT ITSELF OF PROVIDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AGES AS PROVIDERS. HAS BEEN RAISED- DURING THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WAS BROADLY MENTIONED WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING OUT RESULTING ONLY ADOPTED. AND THIS MAY BE DUE IN PART BECAUSE I JUST I JUST AS PROVIDERS AND TO THE PROGRAM. PERHAPS NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING A CAREER OUT OF IT BUT REALLY TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND. HOWEVER THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT- A PRIVATE HOME HEALTH AIDE PROVIDES SO THEN THE QUESTION IS RAISED AS TO WHETHER IT. PERHAPS A MORE TAILORED PROGRAMMING YOUR OUTREACH APPROACH IS NEEDED TO MAKE THOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE WORK THAT I JUST AS PROVIDERS ARE DOING AND CONNECTING THEM TO EXISTING HEALTH CARE PATHWAY PROGRAMS. SO WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MAY TRY. TO GET INTO THIS BROADER CONCEPT AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO REALLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT A ONE WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAME UP WITH THATTWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BAKER WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A FIRM GRASP OF THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE- WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I JUST AS PROVIDERS WILL ULTIMATELY BE SERVED. BUT THEN ALSO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PROBLEM OR UNMET NEED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND HOW IT SUCCESS WILL BE MEASURED. AND WE DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY THE MIX OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES ARE THOSE THE MOST INFECTIVE OR IMPACTFUL- OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCESS PROVIDERS- AND TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THE DEPARTMENT LEVERAGE EXISTING. AND PROVEN HOME HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAMS IT THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS- IN THIS ENDEAVOR. AND AGAIN WE WILL STE- WE'RE STILL BE STAGE OF IT AND- TO MAKE. PROPOSAL AND ILL CONTINUE TO WITH THE MISTER TO ADDITIONAL DE. HOWEVER IF THE NAY. LEVEL OF DEEP CANNOT BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN THE SHORT BUDGET TIME FRAME- BUT THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF IS STILL INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING IN THIS SPACE. WE CAN HELP THE LEGISLATURE THINK THROUGH PERHAPS ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THAT ARE MORE DEFINED IN ACTIONABLE WITHIN THE SHORT TIME FRAME WHICH MAY NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE AS MUCH FUNDING TO BEGIN WITH. BUT CAN AT LEAST BE BUILT UPON PERHAPS NEXT YEAR IN FUTURE YEARS AS THE ADMINISTRATION SOLIDIFIED THE MORE DEFINED LONG TERM STRATEGY- WITH THAT I'LL NOW PASS IT ON TO MY COLLEAGUES LEARN THIS. WHO I WILL END WITH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING I'M AS WELL AS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WILL PROVIDE COMMENTS RELATED TO THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION CONTINUES TO RECOGNIZE THE STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY READY AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND ARE WORTHWHILE GOALS. THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PLAN WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE ASSEMBLY STEP FOR HEARING TOMORROW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY OUR A PIECE OF THIS LARGER MULTI DEPARTMENTAL PROPOSAL. WELL KEY QUESTION WE HAVE A SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSALS AND DSF IS HOW THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND FUNDING INCREASES WORK WITH THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. TO ACHIEVE THE STATED GOAL OF ELIMINATING HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES WITHIN FIVE YEARS. WELL THE REVISION PROPOSES TO EXPAND A JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR A NEW PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE AND RENOVATE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES. MOST PROPOSAL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND EXISTING DSS PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS REPRESENT VERY LARGE INCREASES TO THE BASELINE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE TYPICALLY SPENDS NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON THE CAL WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT ASSESSMENT WAS DONE TO DETERMINE THIS LEVEL OF ESTIMATED NEED FOR EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS. A KEY QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER THE PROGRAM WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER AND SPENT THIS NEW FUNDING WITHIN PROPOSED TIMELINES. WOULD IT BE BETTER PERHAPS TO PROVIDE SMALLER AMOUNTS OVER MORE YEARS. WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES INTRODUCING TBL FOR SOME OF THESE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS WHICH COULD MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO HAVE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS OPERATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION COULD ADDRESS SOME KNOWN BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THESE PROGRAMS WHICH COULD ENHANCE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO SPEND A PROPOSED CONSULTATIONS. HOWEVER THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. IN THE CASE OF THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF TV ALL OF THE PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE ISSUE. THIS CREATES SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE WILL OVERSEE THE PROGRAM. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE OTHER VERY INITIAL THOUGHTS AND QUESTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR THOUGHTS AS MORE DETAILS BECOME AVAILABLE ON THE PROPOSALS. THAT I THINK YOU AND I CONCLUDE THE ELLIOTT'S COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THIS PANEL I WILL NOW BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS- BEFORE I BEGIN WITH MEMBERS QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. SINCE WE HAVE LIMITED TIME AND TODAY'S HEARING AND WE DIDN'T GET TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS WITHIN THE AGENDA. I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR MY STAFF TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR RESPONSES TO COME BACK AND WRITING. AFTER THIS HEARING. WITH THAT WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES- I SIT HERE AND KIND OF REFLECT. A LITTLE BIT. THERE ARE SOME VERY I THINK VERY WORTHY PROGRAMS THAT ARE THERE GOING TO BE FUNDED AT A GREATER LEVELS AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M SPECIFICALLY GONNA SPEAK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. AND I HEARD LORD LOTUS YOU TALKED ABOUT- THAT MORE DETAIL COME AND BUDGET SUB FOR. THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT- YOU TALKED ABOUT A MULTI DEPARTMENTAL PLAN- I GUESS WHAT I LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK OF ALL THE MONEY WE HAVE SPENT AND WILL SPEND ON HOMELESSNESS AND- I WENT I HAVE SOME. SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THAT. IN THE END. WHO IF ANYONE WILL COORDINATE ALL OF THESE EFFORTS SO THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW SOME SOMEBODY'S WHO COORDINATE ALL THESE EFFORTS- AND- IT AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS AND SO I DON'T I REALLY DON'T EXPECT YOU TO- BUT I'M JUST THROWING THIS OUT FOR THOUGHT- HOW ARE WE MEASURING OUTCOMES WITH. ALL THESE DIFFERENT RESOURCES GOING TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS HOW ARE WE MEASURING WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE FOR THE OVERALL HOMELESSNESS ISSUE- DO WE HAVE STATISTICS- THE- FOR THE CATEGORIES OF HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW WHO IS HOMELESS WHY THEY'RE HOMELESS. AND ALL THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN FOR EXAMPLE I THINK OF. MENTAL HEALTH AND- AND- SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER AS AS CONTRIBUTING FACTORS FOR SUN SAID WE HAVE A BIG BREAK DOWN OKAY. THESE ARE ALL THE THESE ARE ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE THESE ARE ALL THE CATEGORIES IS ROB CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. IF WE DO. HOW ARE WE COORDINATING ALL OF THAT BECAUSE- A LOT OF THE WHAT I WILL CALL TE REAL VISIBLE HOMELESS THAT WE SEE HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FEEL TO ME LIKE THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER ISSUES AND HOMELESSNESS AND SO JUST DROPPING THOSE PEOPLE INTO A HOME SETTING. OR YOU KNOW A MOTEL OR WHATEVER DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THEM. DOES IT LEAD TO SUCCESS I WOULD BET. NINETY NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED. SO I GUESS MY BIGGER QUESTION FROM AS I THINK ABOUT THE L. A. O. AND LOOK AT THAT. WHOA WHO'S COORDINATING ALL OF THESE EFFORTS OR ARE WE PUTTING MONEY IN INDIVIDUAL SILOS AND EXPECTING. DIFFERENT RESULTS. THANK YOU SO THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR MANY QUESTIONS AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ACROSS I THINK IT'S UPWARDS OF TEN DEPARTMENTS- FOR VARIOUS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL TO BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE AND STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY SO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL SPEAK TO AND SUPPORT TOMORROW IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT ANY PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY ADOPT DOES HAVE STRONG CREDIBILITY IS METRICS AND REPORTS BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THE STATE IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING ITS GOALS. I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SERVICE AND HOUSING AGENCY IS TO DO AN ASSESSMENT- ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED LOCALLY AND THE STATE WITH THE INTENT OF INSURANCE THIS MORE COORDINATION OVER THE LONG TERM THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO RECENTLY STEP UP- ORAL THAT PROVIDE MORE VISIBILITY INTO THE LEVEL OF SERVICES BEING PROVIDED LOCALLY SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SOME PROGRESS ON. THAT WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THAT SPACE. THANK YOU. IF I COULD ADD JUST RECORD NAY OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUICK ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SO A FEW THINGS I THINK AS AS THE L. A. OFFICE JUST MENTIONED THERE SOME ADDITIONAL ORDINATION AT HAPPENING WITH THE HOMELESS WERE DATING AT COUNCIL WHICH AGAIN MULTI DEPARTMENTAL GOING ACROSS MUCH OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CONNECTED MY COULD AGREE WITH YOU MORE ON THE NEED TO EMIGRATE THE ACTUAL HOUSING SUPPORT INTERVENTION WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMPONENTS TO ENSURE THAT STABILITY IS A REAL ALCOHOL NEVER OUT KINDS SO. I WON I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT BE AT HOME STATE THAT IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AT IS GETTING STOOD UP BY THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES IN HOUSING AGENCY WHICH IS GOING TO HELP GET TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT YOU'VE RAISED HERE TODAY AROUND THE REASONS BEHIND IN SECOND HOW WE'RE GOING FORWARD ALSO REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT AND LIFT UP THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENTS WE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE- AT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS OF COURSE WORDS PREVENTION IT IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO IDENTIFY THAT HOUSING STABILITY WHERE WE ARE RE HOUSING INDIVIDUALS FOR EXAMPLE FROM PROJECT ROOM G. TWO WITH DIFFERENT PERMANENT. ESUPPORT HOUSING SOLUTION OR OTHERWISE WE CAN CERTAINLY MEASURE THAT AS WELL SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THOSE METRICS I WILL BE MORE READILY AVAILABLE REQUIRED. TO SHARE OUR SUCCESSES TO DATE. CORRECT FOR THE- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I HAVE. THAT SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE DATA NOW BUT WE'RE STANDING IT UP CORRECT. THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE DO YEAH. SURE SURE I THINK FOR THE INTERSECTIONAL COMPONENTS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A MORE RICHER DATASETS FOR THE PURPOSES AT THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT DSS ADMINISTERS WE CERTAINLY CAN'T TELL YOU. HOW MANY AT INDIVIDUALS HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEING SERVED WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES LOOK LIKE WE'RE WE'RE GLAD TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU ACROSS THESE PROGRAMS WERE LOOKING TO EXPAND INVESTMENT. I WE ALSO HAVE A NOT RIGHT NOW IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A SURVEY OF COURSE AS YOU MAY KNOW THE POINT IN TIME COUNT DIDN'T OCCUR. I LAST YEAR DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WHICH PROVIDES SOME INFORMATION AGAIN POINT IN TIME AROUND ASK HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS AND WHO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE THAT ARE AND SHELTERED. I BUT WE ARE RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH DOCTOR CAN SHOW AND TO HAVE SOME SURVEYING ACROSS- INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES TO LEAD US OUT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DATA AND INFORMATION SO YES WE DO HAVE INFORMATION TODAY. ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE STARVING WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES ARE ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS AND WILL HAVE A RICHARD K. THE SECOND TERMS THAT. HAS THIS PERSON I TOUCH THE SYSTEM PRIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OUTCOMES WHERE THE CONNECTIONS TO SERVICES ETCETERA WITH THE H. D. I. SYSTEM STIS. SYSTEM THAT'S BEING STOOD UP. SO IN A IN A IN THIS BE MY LAST QUESTION I THINK YOU FOR YOUR- MISTER CHAIR. SO I GUESS THAT BEGS THE BIGGER QUESTION THAT I HAVE I MEAN I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH SORRY IN THE- YOU NOW- DO WE IS THERE IT IS YOU'VE GOT ALL THE STATE ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS. IS THERE A TEAM IS THERE A CORE GROUP OF PEOPLE THIS WORKING ACROSS MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE I. OR ARE WE GONNA WAIT FOR THE DATA SETS AND- WE JUST GONNA SPEND MONEY. NOW WITHOUT THE DATA TO REAL IS I JUST I'M I'M LOOKING FOR SOME I'M LOOKING FOR SOME. SOME REASSURANCE AND SOME HELP THAT THAT THIS IS A REAL COORDINATED EFFORT THAT. THAT WORKS ACROSS THE SILOS WE KNOW ALL EXIST IN AND STATE GOVERNMENT. SURE TWO THINGS I'D SAY TO THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WIND IS THAT IT IS THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL THAT HAS THAT LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS TO COME TOGETHER JUST ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED. AS SOMEBODY'S PRIORITIES AND PLANS MOVING FORWARD PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF MAY REDUCTIONS IN THAT IS THAT WAS. THAT WHO IS THAT THAT'S OUR DAY THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE B. C. S. H. I'M SORRY THE OLD. OKAY BUSINESS CONSUMERS. AND HOUSING AGENCY. SO IS THE PERSON AHEAD OF THAT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS I MEAN WHO WHO WHO IS WEARING THEY COORDINATION HAPPENING THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. YES THEY ARE THEY ARE STOCKING THE BODY WHERE THAT COORDINATION IS OCCURRING IN ADDITION TO THAT OTHERS NO DOUBT AS THROUGH THE LAST. TWO YEARS SPECIFICALLY THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY COMING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY HOW TO LEVERAGE BLEND BRADY SPENDING STRINGS WE'VE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TOOLS THAT WE RECENTLY RELEASED. JUST AROUND FINANCING AND LEVERAGING RESOURCES HOW WE'RE TAKING HOME HE AS A PLACE TO ACQUIRE. BUILDING FACILITY BUT ALSO THEN WRAPPING IN THE SERVICES THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS EXCEPT REST OF THAT IS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME ACROSS DEPARTMENTS IN ADDITION. TO THE VISIONING AND LONGER TERM GOAL SETTING WITH THAT HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. SO AND I APOLOGIZE SO HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET TO THAT POINT. I GUESS IT WE'RE WE'RE NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING TO GO GO OUT THE DOOR HERE FAIRLY QUICKLY IS IT GOING TO GO OUT WITH. THE OVER ARCHING PLANS IN THE GUIDANCE OR IS IT JUST GOING TO GO OUT THE DOOR- AT THIS POINT I'M SORRY I DON'T MEAN I REALLY I REALLY AM TRYING TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE HERE I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS SPENT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY AND SO JUST LOOKING FOR SOME ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS. SOME BIG COORDINATION HERE THAT LOOKS AT ALL THESE FACTORS AND THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE END OF A LINE THAT SAYS YEAH WE DID. THIS RIGHT AND WE GOT GREAT OUTCOMES. THE VERY MUCH. THAT AND OUT. THERE ARE STE. REQUIREMENTS TO DATE FOR THE COUNCIL I'M REFERENCING AROUND THE APPROACHES ANY DEPARTMENT IS TAKING SO THAT'S THINGS LIKE THINKING ABOUT. HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES SO THEY DO WE DO HAVE THROUGH LINES ACROSS ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF YOUR COACHES WERE DOING IN TERMS OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND DELIVERY- AND THAT AGAIN THAT WORK CONTINUES IN THAT SPACE. AND FULLY APPRECIATE THAT OUT VERY CLEARLY THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE FOR AT THE LEGISLATURE AROUND THE OUTCOMES AND HOW THESE. INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS ARE COMING TOGETHER IT'S SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY ARE COMMITTED TO AND CONTINUED TO ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER. AT TO PROVIDE SO GET HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SPECIFICS ON THE METRICS AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE THOSE IN OUR IN OUR SUCCESS TO DATE. THANK YOU. NEXT ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS ALL START WITH- HSS IS YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT- THE CAP ON HOURS. HELLO OKAY IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT UNREALISTIC FOR AS MANY HOURS THERE ARE THERE ARE IN THE MONTHS. THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO. INCREASE THE HOURS SO THE PEOPLE HAVE A LEVEL OF CARE THAT THEY DESERVE- THAT WAS CHANGED WHEN THE FEDERAL MANDATE. WAS IMPLEMENTED BUT- YOU KNOW IT JUST SOMETIMES I WONDERING IF WHAT IF THERE IS A PLAN TO LOOK AT INCREASING THE HOURS ON THE CAP. PRICE HSS. YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE PROPOSAL THAT I REFERENCED WITHIN THE MAY REVISION IS A RESTORATION- OF A REDUCTION OF 7% IN HOURS- THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE PAST IN VARIOUS FORMS AND THEN BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE TIME FOR SUSPENSION. AND THIS IS ELIMINATING THAT REDUCTION I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY PREFERRING SEPARATELY TO THE FACT THAT THE IHS US PROGRAM HAS A STATUTORY MAXIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE HOURS OF SERVICES. PER MONTH AND WE DO NOT AT THIS TIME HAVE ANY PROPOSALS RELATED TO THAT STATUTORY MAXIMUM. HAS THE L. A. O. HAD ANY KIND OF OPPORTUNITY TO. GO BACK AND ADDRESS THE AUDIT AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE'S BEEN. A LOT HSS THERE IS THERE'S BEEN IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS OR- IS THERE OTHER SUGGESTIONS HELIO HAS BASED OUT OF THAT POINT FORWARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE REVIEWED THE AUDIT IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDIT THAT WAS RELEASED I BELIEVE SOMETIME IN FEBRUARY- WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK BACK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO DIG A BIT DEEPER ON THERE ARE A LOT OF. FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS MADE SO IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR BUCKET THAT YOU WOULD WANT US TO FOLLOW UP ON WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT. AND ONE MORE QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. THE ONE THE ONLY THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I DO HAVE IS BASED ON. THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO BREAK MOVING BRING MORE PROVIDERS WE KNOW THAT I. HSS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MONEY- IT SAVES US HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS ARE WE GOING TO DO- TO INCENTIVIZE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN. IN HIGH SCHOOLS TO BRIDGE PEOPLE OR EVEN ANY WALK OF LIFE TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THIS WORKFORCE- TO NOT ONLY. CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CARE FOR THE FOR THE POPULATION BUT ALSO- OR WORK FOR CENTER. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AB THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELATED TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT MORE BROADLY WHICH CERTAINLY CAN BENEFIT THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION AS WELL. AS WHAT YOU JUST ASKED ALSO DOES RELATE TO OUR WERE PROPOSAL FOR THE LONG TERM CARE CAREER PATHWAYS- IN THE SENSE THAT IT M. BOTH IT CAN BE USED BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEWLY BECOMING I. HSS PROVIDERS AS WELL AS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I. HSS PROVIDERS. AND ONCE YOU UP SKILL AND- INCREASE THEIR SKILLS WITHIN THE IHS US PROGRAM AND OR TO MOVE ON TO OTHER- HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONS AND WE THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CARE GIVING. ONE MORE QUESTION AND BASED ON THAT. DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF DATA THAT THAT KIND OF- SHOWS THAT WE HAVE A DEFICIENCY IN OF PROVIDER CARE. I DON'T KNOW IF THE L. A. O. HAS ANYTHING OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS IN TERMS OF STATISTICS I DO NOT HAVE A STATISTIC CANDY FOR YOU CERTAINLY ANECDOTALLY WE HEAR- QUITE OFTEN IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING PROCESS WE DID HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS QUITE A BIT. THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS- BOTH IN TERMS OF FINDING A PROVIDER GENERALLY AND SPECIFICALLY FINDING BACKUP CARE WHICH HAS LED TO OUR MAY REVISION PROPOSAL WITH RESPECT TO OUR PERMANENT BACKUP CARE SYSTEM. SO I WOULD SAY THEN IF WE ARE. EXPECTED TO RELEASE MONEY THROUGH A BUDGET. THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN EFFORT TO- CREATED AND BACK FILL THAT HOLE OF CARE FOR THIS POPULATION IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY GOES WITHOUT THAT WE ALL INTEND THAT THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN A- APPROPRIATE MANNER THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT. BACK TO THE CHAIR I FIRST WANT TO SPEAK IF I CAN ABOUT TELL WORKS AND THE IMPORTANCE THAT THIS PROGRAM PLAYS. IN US ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM. THIS PROGRAM BY ITS NATURE HAS NOT ALWAYS HELP OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THUS AM ENCOURAGED BY THE DIRECTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING IN WITH CAL WORKS TO POINT OUT. AS WELL AS CAL OR OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE DRIVING TOWARDS METRICS AND IMPROVING UPON THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE DESIRED EFFECT OF DISRUPTING POVERTY AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES. SO I REALLY WANTED DAY AGAIN IF I CAN INTO THE H. S. P. PROPOSAL AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET MORE DETAILS TO OUR STAFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BUT HOW THESE FUNDS WILL BE ENVISIONED AND UTILIZED TO HELP US WITH CASELOADS AND SERVICES. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF REACHING ZERO HOMELESS IN OUR STATE. AND SPECIFICALLY I'D LIKE TO ASK WHAT PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WITH THIS INVESTMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR YES GLAD TO BE MORE SPECIFIC HERE AGAIN I MENTIONED BRIEFLY IN THE OPENING REMARKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WHAT WE ARE SEEING SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THAT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. 85% OF THE FAMILIES ARE TOUCHING THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM I WERE ACTUALLY RECENTLY RECEIVING CAO WORKS- OR HAD RECEIVED IT RECENTLY SO WE AGAIN BELIEVE THAT THIS INVESTMENT EXPANSION. IS TARGETING EXACTLY WHO WE NEED TO AND SUPPORTING AND REACHING OUR GOAL. AT THE ADDITIONAL- WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND H. S. P. WITH THE EXPANSION IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT PREVENTION. SO WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE AT THAT STRESSOR OR AT CHECK OUT OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS OCCURRING RELATED TO INFECTION- IN THE HSP DESIGN WAS LIKE TO LOOK FURTHER EXTREME IN OUR ABILITY TO ACTUAL WE- ARE BE ABLE TO. PROACTIVELY PROVIDE THESE RESOURCES TO AGAIN I PROVIDE STABILITY DIRECT STABILITY EFFORTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST OF COURSE THE LAST YEAR OR SO. HI BEGIN DEMONSTRATED THAT WHEN WE CAN CREATE BANKS HAVE A BIG XIN OUT WE ARE CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER OFF IN TERMS OF THE LONGER TERM OUTCOMES FOR THE FAMILY SO AGAIN OUR GOAL WOULD BE TO WORK ON OUTLINING SOME ADDITIONAL. BROADER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ON WHO COULD BE SEE. THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND AM REALLY LIKED YOUR ABOUT A- AS A CAL WORKS. OUR BEST ABILITY TO GET UPSTREAM OF MANY OF THE PROBLEMS. THAT FACE US OF THE STATE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S HOMELESSNESS OR- SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH AND SO SEE THESE INVESTMENTS THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US. I THINK THE QUESTION I HAVE DIRECTOR IS A GAP ANALYSIS AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THESE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. WE'VE DONE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR BOTH THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR BUT- WOULD LIE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH NEED THERE IS WITHIN THE CAL WORKS POPULATION TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. PROVIDING ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GET FULLY UPSTREAM. GLAD TO DO THAT CHAIR WE HAVE BOTH- THE NUMBER I HAVE- APPLIQUE APPLICANTS THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE APPLICATION. TO ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED THAT HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT WE COULD CERTAINLY PROVIDE AT YOU IN THE COMMITTEE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. THERE WERE EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TEN PEOPLE AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WHO TOUCH THE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM SO AGAIN. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INVESTMENTS OVER THE COURSE. OF FIVE YEARS IS GOING TO HELP US AGAIN GET TO THAT FUNCTIONAL ZERO SO GLAD TO PROVIDE TO YOU BOTH THE- NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN TERMS OF NEED FROM OUR COUNTY APPLICATION PROCESS. BUT ALSO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHING THE SYSTEM. LIKE TO DRAW A PARALLEL AND CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF AND HE WAS WHILE DIRECTOR SPECIFICALLY ON HOW WE CAN PROVIDE. RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS. WITHIN CAL AIM THIS YEAR WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ECM AN ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT THAT WE WILL BE GIVING TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS. WITHIN OUR CAL WORKS POPULATION WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH AN INTENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT TOOL TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS OF BENEFIT FOR. THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS. I'D LIKE TO ENGAGE INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEEING IF WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO WE CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS AT THE YOUNGEST AGE THAT WE CAN. RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL WE GET DOWNSTREAM AND HAVING TO DO IT WITH AND CAL LAME AND ECM. INSTEAD GET UPSTREAM AND REALLY PROVIDE THE RESOURCES IN THE INTENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT. WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. WHAT GLAD TO CONNECT FURTHER AT HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL THATINCREASES THOSE HOURS THAT CERTAINLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE FAMILY STABILIZATION RESOURCES IN A COW WORKS PROGRAM AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT COUNTIES HAVE. THE RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR IT TO BE A HOUSEHOLDS IN THE FAMILIES THAT NEED THAT SUPPORT THE MOST SO GLAD TO ADD GAUGES MEDICINAL CONVERSATION ON WHAT LED US. TO OUR- OUR HOURS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF THEIR RESOURCES FRANCIS INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT WHAT WE THINK AND IT'S GOT TO. FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I LOVE TO INVOLVE C. W. D. A. INTO THAT- DISCUSSION AS I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOME NUMBERS FOR BOTH THIS BUDGET YEAR AN ON GOING THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR. THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND REALLY HOPE WE CAN. BE PRODUCTIVE AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF. THOSE WHO ARE IN THE COLORS PROGRAM. I'D LIKE TO NOW FOCUS MY QUESTIONS IF I CAN ON TO THE COUNTY MATCH. I SAW ON A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS NUMBERS FIVE SIX AND EIGHTEEN- THE- H. TAPPED THE HOME SAFE IN THE BRING FAMILY HOMES. PROPOSALS THAT THERE WAS A COUNTY MATCH. AND GENERALLY WOULD LIKE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF THIS 25% MATCH WHICH IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACCESS AND UTILIZE THESE FUNDS. WILL THIS INHABIT THE ABILITIES OF COUNTIES. TO READILY UTILIZE THESE ANTI HOMELSSNESS FUNDS. AND WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES IS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING WITH THIS INVESTMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR OUT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT THIS DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS DO YOU HAVE A ONE TO ONE MATCH. IN THE EXPANSION IN SEVERAL OF THE PROGRAMS WE ARE PROPOSING A 25% MATCH A LEICESTER MATCH BUT THAT THERE STILL IS THE COMMITMENTS AND ENGAGEMENT. LEVERAGING THE WHOLE TO THE PRIOR AT COMMENTS MADE WE REALLY DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INTEGRATING BLENDING BLAKE GRADING AND LEVERAGING. THESE ARE THE INVESTMENTS LOCALLY AND AFTER COMING TOGETHER SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT I WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY. I HAVE FOR THE MATCH TO ENSURE THAT AGAIN I COUNTIES ARE WORKING HOLISTICALLY ACROSS THE SPENCER SYSTEM TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES. I'M GLAD TO AND TO FURTHER MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THEY WANT TO SEE MORE ABOUT AT A MATCH. IN A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- COMES FROM IN FINANCE THANK YOU CAN FOR THAT HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD- JUST REITERATING THE FACT THAT EXISTING. RUN STATURE WITH THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE SOMEONE TO NOT ONE MATCH THIS IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO REDUCE THAT ONE TO ONE MATCH. I'M WITH THE 25% WHICH- WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO- PULL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN AND ASK THAT WE FOLLOW UP TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE THAT THESE MATCHING FUNDS MAY HAVE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTIES. REPRESENTING A POOR RURAL COUNTY IT'S OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT FOR US TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO COME UP WITH THOSE MATCHING FUNDS AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTS. WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO MY FINAL TWO QUESTIONS. NEXT I WILL LOOK AT ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THE F. F. P. S. A. INVESTMENTS. AND I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. I FEEL LIKE WE NEED MORE DETAILS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WAS HOPING THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH THE SUB COMMITTEE THE LANGUAGE. THAT WILL BE RELEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS SPECIFICALLY IN PART FOUR OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND THEN WHICH CATEGORIES OF ISSUES DOES THE REVISED LANGUAGE ADDRESS WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. THIRD OUR TOO- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED PIECES TO F. PSA THAT I THINK ARE PROBABLY WORTH HIGHLIGHTING IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION ONE IS UPDATES TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU RECEIVED WITH- THE JANUARY BUDGET. AND THEN THE SECOND IS- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLOCK GRANTS WHICH IS NEWLY PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION- BOTH OF THOSE ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE PROVIDED THIS WEEK POTENTIAL EVEN AS SOON AS TODAY. D. WITH RESPECTABLE BANK WHICH FROM JANUARY- THAT LANGUAGE HAS BEEN OUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED. SOME OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS ACTUALLY RELATE TO OUR PREVENTION PLAN WHICH IS DUE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S- CAUGHT- COMMENTS ON THINGS LIKE WHAT IT IS THAT QUALIFIES SOMEONE TO BE A CANDIDATE. FOR FOSTER CARE OR AT IMMINENT RISK OF FOSTER CARE THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE- PREVENTION PLAN PROCESS NOT IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WE DO ANTICIPATE RELEASING A REVISED VERSION OF OUR PREVENTION PLAN- BY THE END OF THIS MONTH EARLY NEXT MONTH. THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE THINGS THEY DO ACTUALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN STATE STATUTE- WE RECEIVED A LOT OF COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO PART FOUR. OF FF PSA ON THINGS LIKE THE ROLE OF THE- THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL IN ASSESSING THE CHILD'S NEEDS AND SERVICES. AND ALSO THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE- IN SHORT ACCESS TO NURSING SERVICES UNDER PART FOUR REQUIREMENTS SO THOSE REFINEMENTS TO THOSE PIECES ARE ARE BUT I'M ALSO REFERRING TO IS THE BUT WILL BE AVAILABLE VERY SOON- AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVENTION FUNDING WHAT'S NEW IN THE MAY REVISION. IS A PROPOSAL FOR THIS BLOCK GRANTS TO PROVIDE SOME- INITIAL UPFRONT INVESTMENT TO YOU- SUPPORT THE COUNTIES THAT OPT IN TO PART ONE. OF PREVENTION SERVICES TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE WILL BE PROPOSING LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE-COUNTY PLANS. THAT ARE- WILL NEED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE COUNTIES OPTING IN TO RECEIVE THOSE BLOCK GRANTS AND THAT TOO YOU WILL BE AVAILABLE VERY SOON THIS WEEK. THANK YOU FOR THAT- I LOOK FORWARD. PERMISSION OF MY FINAL QUESTION WILL BE ON NUMBER THIRTY FOUR REGARDING DACA AND THE NATURALIZATION FILING FEES. I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT NETWORK OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT THIS. OR WOULD THIS PROPOSAL WARRANT CONSIDERATION OF SERVICE PROVIDER NEEDS SPECIFICALLY IT SEEMS THAT THE FUNDS ARE FOR THE FILING FEES BUT WHO IS IT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE FILING. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION CHAIR YES THE ANSWER IS THAT YES WE DO BELIEVE THAT ARE. THAT CAPACITY EXISTS TO COUPLE OF REASONS WHY ONE FIRST I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST GENUINELY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY ON THIS EFFORT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID EARLY ON THE WITH THE FUNDING TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON IMMIGRATION SERVICES FIND WAYS TO ENSURE WE WERE INCLUDING SOME CAPACITY BUILDING. RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AT THE BILL THAT OVER TIME AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT SO IT IS WITH BOTH- OUR EXISTING NETWORK WHICH HAS BEEN IT HAS HAVE HAS NOT BE ABILITY TO GROW BUT ALSO TO REACH. OUT COMMUNITIES I AM POPULATIONS THAT WERE INITIALLY ON AND NOT BACK WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE. WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT EFFORT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT ADD TO THE CBO'S AT WHAT THE RESOURCES TO GO FORWARD SO YES WE DO BELIEVE THE EXISTING NETWORK HAS THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE ISSUANCE. ISSUANCE. OF THE SILENT PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING CONVERSATIONS I AYE WELL IN THIS SECTION IF I CAN SPEAKING ABOUT. FOOD AND- DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I HAVE THAT- THERE WASN'T FURTHER INVESTMENTS INTO OUR FOOD BANK INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ONE TIME INVESTMENTS WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAD- I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE LAST CRISIS WE WILL GO THROUGH AS A STATE. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S DROUGHT OR- A WILD FIRE WE WILL HAVE NEEDS FOR HER FOOD BANKS AND BELIEVES THAT INVESTMENTS INTO. HELPING THEM WITH TRANSPORTATION OR RENOVATING THEIR FACILITIES WILL GO A LONG WAY FOR AS A STATE. AND BELIEVE THOSE INVESTMENTS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR US TO LOOK AT AS WE ARE PUTTING THIS BUDGET TOGETHER. I ALSO WANTED TO UP LIFT THE EFFORTS WITH FOOD FOR ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR IMMIGRANTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO. FOOD THAT WE ARE DISTRIBUTING AS A STATE IT IS. AGAIN IRONIC WHEN YOU COME FROM THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD TO HAVE AS MUCH FOOD SECURITY IN SECURITY. AS YOU DO IN MY COMMUNITY. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH PANEL NUMBER ONE WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER TWO. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. ME REVISED. FOR THIS WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTER ON THE PAY. JOE HOBBY ED. THE DIRECTOR OF TO PER OF REHABILITATION. NANCY BARGE MAN WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE HOLIDAYS PLAN MINIMALIST OFFICE. LET'S BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR HOW YET. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF GOOD MORNING TO YOU- I'M JONES XAVIER DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND- GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL AND CERTAINLY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU HAVE. THE GOVERNOR'S- COME BACK PLAN ALSO INCLUDES- THIS INITIATIVE TO HELP IMPLEMENT- FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. AND I WOULDN'T KNOW TO HEAR THAT EMPLOYMENT HAS A VERY POSITIVE BENEFIT BOTH ON HEALTH. COMMUNITY LIVING AND PROVIDING A PATH OUT OF POVERTY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. WE SEEK TO DO TWO THINGS HERE ONE IS TO ADDRESS. THE JOB LAWS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC O THAT WE'VE BEEN IN. AND TO FOCUS ON THE OVERALL INCREASING THE EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. SO REALLY THIS RESPONSE FROM BILLIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE DISABILITY- I CANNOT- GET SCREAMED INTO THE INTERVIEW I DON'T GET AN INTERVIEW AND IF I GET AN INTERVIEW I'M NOT GETTING THE JOB. AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IN THIS PROPOSAL IS WHO'S DOING THE HIRING AND TAKING SOME INITIATIVES TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE EMPLOYMENT EQUATION. THE PARADIGM REALLY IS SHIFTING BUSINESS THINKING FROM YOUR HIRING BECAUSE AS A SOCIAL GOOD TO YOUR TRULY HIRING BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FRIENDS REFLECT A LARGE MARKET SHARE BUT YOU AS AN EMPLOYER YOU WANT OR YOU AS A BUSINESS WANT TO MAKE SURE- IS REPRESENTATIVE IN YOUR WORK FORCE. SO ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH THESE INITIATIVES IS TO- TRANSFORM THE TRANSACTIONAL ENGAGEMENT OF BUSINESS ON HIRE TO REALLY- SHIFT THAT MINDSET THAT I'VE DESCRIBED SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS. ONE IS- INITIATE A TARGETED CAMPAIGN THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON- LIFTING UP THE EMPLOYMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. TO INCENTIVIZE. THREE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND A COUPLE OF OTHER NATIONAL WAYS THE EMPLOYERS TO HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM DIRECTOR BARGE MEN FROM DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE THIRD LEG OF THIS. SO THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN- REALLY FOCUSES ON DOING THREE THINGS. ONE USE THE STATE'S CONVENING POWER TO BRING EMPLOYEES TOGETHER TO- LIFT UP- AND GET THEIR COMMITMENT INTO HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEN TO. THROUGH GRANT DOLLARS- THROUGH OUR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS ANOTHER SOURCES REALLY- LIFT UP THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE DOING A GOOD JOB PROVIDE RECOGNITION THAT ARE REALLY HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. THE THIRD PIECE OF THIS IS TO RALLY- CREATE AN EMPLOYER INCENTIVE- PACKAGE THAT IT HOPES EMPLOYERS- LEAN INTO THE HIRING AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. ONE THING THAT WE WOULD DO IS TO PROVIDE BOTH GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FOCUS ON THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM DO TWO THINGS ONE IS MAKE A COMMITMENT TO HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. AND TO- HELP THEM ADDRESS ANY ACCESS ISSUES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE- IN BRINGING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES INTO THE WORK FORCE. THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGERS COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS UP FRONT AND FRANKLY TO BORROW AN EARLIER TIME USED. UPSTREAM BOTH THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE DOING THE HIRING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY DOING THE HIRING AND THEIR LEADERSHIP AND SO PROVIDING THEM WITH SOME AWARENESS AND SKILL SET AROUND THE RECRUITMENT. THE SCREENING AND THE HIGHER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT THEY WILL BE. MORE OPEN- AND WILLING TO BRING THOSE INDIVIDUALS INTO THE WORK FORCE AND THE THIRD ELEMENTS. I'M THEIR SISTER- FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM- I SHARED LEARNING- AND WORK EXPERIENCE OPPORTUNITY OUR MODEL THAT I OFTEN POINT TO WHEN THIS IS- HANDS ON WITH THE HYATT HOTEL SYSTEM WHAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE CULINARY ARTS. GO TO WORK FOR THE HYATT HOTELS IN THIS EARN AND LEARN APPROACH THEY GET BOTH OF THE EXPERIENCE- AND THE SKILL SET THAT IS NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND THEN OF COURSE WORD HI IT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE HIGHER THERE THEY ARE BUT THEY HAVE BOTH OF NOW THE SKILL SET. AND HIGHER AS A REFERENCE TO GO ON TO WORKING ANOTHER HOTELS OTHER RESTAURANTS IN THE OTHER PLACE THAT PROVIDES. CULINARY SERVICES. THE OTHER PIC THE THING THAT WE DO HERE IS WOULD HOW HAVE ONE LIMITED TERM POSITION THAT WOULD BE FOR ADMINISTERING THIS- THESE GRANTS OF ONE JUST TALKING ABOUT HERE AND GETTING THESE INITIATIVES- UP. COLLEAGUE IS. THE SUSPENSION OF THE RATE INCREASE FOR THE JOB COACHING AND THAT IS ALSO LISTED IN THE AGENDA ITEM THERE. SO ALL STOP MY COMMENTS THEIR ALTERNATE OVER TO DIRECTOR BARGE MEANT TO SPEAK TO THE OTHER. PART OF THE INITIATIVE SO NANCY YEAR. THANK YOU DIRECTOR EXACTLY IN- YOU MISTER TO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RELIX ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. FURTHER THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO FOCUS ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- WE REALLY REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO LEAN INTO SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS- TO FURTHER THEIR THEIR DESIRE AND INTEREST AND ABILITY TO. BE A PART OF THE VALUED WORK FORCE- IN OUR COMMUNITY AND- THROUGH THIS GRANT PROGRAM IT REALLY DOES BUILD UPON AND MANY OF THE INITIATIVES- THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON BUT AS MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED- SO AS IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT- INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES REALLY DO REPRESENT A VERY SMALL PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE- AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT- THROUGH EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL ALSO SAY. THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF THAT THE GREATEST- STAFF AND WORK FORCE THAT YOU CAN NEVER HAVE- TO BE PART OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SO TO HAVE THE IMPACT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC BE SO SIGNIFICANT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON. OF RECOVERY BUT THEN ALSO LONGER TERM STRATEGIES- TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO TO HELP BUSINESSES SEE THE VALUE AND THE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUALS- WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- THAT THEY BRING TO THE. WORK FORCE INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO THE AREA THAT- DDS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO- FOCUSING ON IN ADDITION TO THE COLLABORATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHAB ON THEIR EFFORTS- BECAUSE WE REALLY WILL USE OUR OUR EFFORT TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY INITIATIVE- IS REALLY DONE IN CONCERT TOGETHER- WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE I'M USING A GRANT PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD WANT TO USE OUR EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE GRANT PROGRAMS FOR OTHER INITIATIVES- TO BE BUILT ON IN IN THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE REQUESTING FOR THIS PURPOSE- AND THE FUNDING WOULD REALLY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROVIDERS. REGIONAL CENTERS- SMALL BUSINESSES TO WORK TOGETHER- AND REALLY BRIDGE THAT GAP YOU KNOW LOOKING AT WHERE WE CAN- PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESSES AS AN EXAMPLE- TO OPEN THE DOOR HAVE THE ABILITY TO- TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE- THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TAKE A LOOK AT IF THERE'S ANY- ACCOMMODATIONS THAT'S NEEDED THAT WE CAN ENHANCE THAT- AND THEN USE THE- ABILITY TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS- AND INCREASE OUR OPPORTUNITIES- ONE OF THAT THE LAST THING SAID LIKE TO NOTE. IS THAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THIS IS A PATHWAY TO EMPLOYMENT- AND WE HAVE OTHER INITIATIVES THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO- IN A LITTLE BIT IS THAT COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND ARE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS. THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE EFFORTS- AND AGAIN BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN SUCH A DECREASE- SO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE PATHWAYS TOGETHER I'M USING THIS AS A WAY TO. REALLY FOCUS AND- DO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN INTENSE- FOCUSED IN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO HAD READ NOT- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THIS INVESTMENT SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR. TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. NOT WE'LL HEAR FROM SUN UP WITH THE L. I THINK YOU MISTER TERROR US YOU PUT IT FROM THE LEDGE. AND OFFICE. AS MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ILIO NOTED EARLIER WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION AND ESPECIALLY AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND- WE WILL BE RELEASING US AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OVER THE COMING WEEK. I'M IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD ALSO NOTE AGAIN THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO COMMENT ON AREAS IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS ALIGN WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. AND THEN TO DISCUSS ANY ISSUES THAT WE SEE WITH THAT WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSALS SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE EMPLOYMENT GRANTS PROPOSED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. TO INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE ENTITIES TO DEVELOP INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS WE WOULD NOTED THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE- THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED EMPLOYMENT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR INCREASED INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS DOES ALIGN WITH PREVIOUS. LEGISLATIVE ACTION INCLUDING THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST LAW PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AS WELL AS FUNDING PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR PAID INTERNSHIPS AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED. EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES. NO I OFFICE WOULD KNOW THAT THE THAT THIS SEEMS TO HAVE MERIT HOWEVER BECAUSE THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS NOT YET AVAILABLE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REVIEW THE DETAILS OR CONDUCT A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT- IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR IF THE PROPOSED ACTIONS ARE THE BEST METHOD TO ENGAGE OUR EMPLOYERS AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE DON'T KNOW- WHEN ALL. OTHER ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED. WE WOULD NOT THE DDS PROPOSES TO CHANGE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE GOVERNING ITS CURRENT INTERNSHIP- A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COVER. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW FUNDING ONLY COVERS THE PAID INTERNSHIP ITSELF IT APPEARS THAT THAT- PROPOSED CHANGE THE LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THESE EMPLOYMENT BROWN'S PROPOSEDFOR DEAL ARE IN DCS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY. THE LAST COMMENT- THAT WE WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT GRANT PROPOSAL IS THAT CURRENT- OR RATHER ABOUT- DDS IS CURRENT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT. THE CURRENT INTERNSHIP AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON- A CAPPED AMOUNT PER YEAR PER PERSON AND IT'S BASED ON AN EARLIER AND LOWER STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER REFINING LANGUAGE SO AS NOT TO LIMIT AN INDIVIDUAL'S CHANCE TO WORKING. FULL TIME INTERNSHIP OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND THEN THE FINAL CUT I MAKE A REGARDING DIRECT AND SAVE YOU CEMENT OF THE- OF SUSPENSION- FOR JOB COACHING AND JOB SUPPORT- DO YOU GENERAL SPEAKING THE WOMEN. OF SOME. ARE THE- O. R. AND- IN OF SO RATE INCREASE AS AS YOU HALL. SCHEDULE ARE A LINE WITH BOTH WITH LET'S JUST PRAYER AS WELL AS RECOMMENDED THAT OUR OFFICE HAS MADE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASK DIRECTOR PARCHMAN TO MAKE SURE SHE HAD ADDRESSED THE DDS COMPONENT OF THIS PANEL. RECTOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APOLOGIES TO THE COMMITTEE- I'D SO TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROPOSALS- FOR THIS YEAR THAT- DDS IS- PROVIDING THAT THAT IT'S INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND JUST MAKE NOTES THAT I WILL BE HIGHLIGHTING STEP SEVERAL ELEMENTS WITHIN THE AGENDA AND- FOR YOUR TRACKING I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE OF THOSE- RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S ITEM. 575-355-5450 EIGHT AND SIXTY THREE- I WILL JUST- PROVIDE JUST OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW FOR YOU- I'M JUST IS THAT A REFERENCE POINT IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S- BUDGET. AS A- PROPOSAL FOR- BUDGET YEAR TO BE FUNDED AT- TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION TOTAL FUNDS SIX POINT SIX BILLION GENERAL FUND AND IT REPRESENTS A PROJECTION OF SERVICES 230-086-0004 HUNDRED THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS AS A CASELOAD OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD REALLY ARE IN ALIGNMENT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S VISION AND HAVING TO COME BACK PLAN AND FOCUSING ON REALLY THOSE AREAS IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT THE HEALTH IN THE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN FUELED BY THE CAN DOWN BACK- AND THAT HAS BEEN VERY DEVASTATED SO MANY COMMUNITIES- OF NOTE- AND WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARING WITH YOU TODAY. IS A FOCUS WITH OUR CHILDREN PARTICULARLY WITH AN EARLY START RECOVERY CONTINUING TO DO OF FOCUSED WORK ON- SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY AND THEN REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE THAT IS HERE IN A CALL TO SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. I'M SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO JUST GO- THE LETTERMAN FOR. ALLEGED THAT WE FOR. ITEM FIFTH SEVEN. OF THIS IS A REALLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND DISRUPTED- AT ISSUE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE'VE NOTED AND WE'VE BEEN TRACKING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LEFT THE EARLY START PROGRAM AND HAVE NOT BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR LETTERMAN SERVICES. UNDER A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND SO I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- BURKE EIGHT IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND TEN. THAT WE HAD. SIX SIXTY THREE THOUSAND FORTY NINE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES DURING THAT TIME AT THAT AGE GROUP. OF NOTE EIGHT POINT 1% SELF JUST OVER FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN EXPERIENCED A GAP BETWEEN BEING AN EARLY START AND THEN HAVING TO RETURN TO LETTERMAN SERVICES. SO IN THIS GAP- IT IS ALSO NOTED. THAT A NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. SO 75% OF THE CHILDREN AND EXPERIENCE THIS GAP- IS OUR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM- WHEN WE HAD DETERMINES ELIGIBILITY IS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THAT. AND SO WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING TO BRING KIDS IN AT A LATER DATE WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. IN WHICH- THIS PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY- PRESENTED TO ADDRESS THIS- ONE KEY ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR EARLY START IN ROME AND HAS BEEN DOWN BY TEN PERCENT. COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR THE SAME MONTH. THIS DECLINE AS WE'VE NOTED TO AND WE'VE I'M SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON BRINGING THE KIDS IN. FROM BIRTH TO THREE TO THE REYES ALSO ENTERS FIRST AND SERVICE. BUT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT WE BETWEEN TEN AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT MAY HAVE ACCESS EARLY START SERVICES IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THAT WOULD NOT THAT HAVE NOT ACTUALLY ACCESS THESE SERVICES TO THAT END OUR PROPOSAL IS PRESENTING- I REQUEST TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY FROM THREE ON THAT. SO THIS PROVISION WHICH I'M REMOVED A REQUIREMENT OF HAVING AN ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS- OF AN INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE LATTER MANAK- BUT IT WOULD STATE THAT THERE WOULD BE THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW TO- SIGNIFICANT- AREAS OF JUST- OF DELAYS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED BY THE PHOENICIANS. SO WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE CAN DISRUPT AND THIS- TREND THAT WE HAVE AS WELL AS RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC. ADDITIONALLY ENHANCING THAT ENHANCE- CASELOAD RATIOS ITEM FIFTY THREE IS IT THIS IS ONE THAT WE'RE REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY WITH OUR DISPARITY FUNDS PROGRAM IS A REMINDER. ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. EASTERLING ALSO. I INTO THE SEVEN PROPOSED A REDUCE CASELOAD RATIO I'M FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LOW AND NO POS- THEIR PARTICULAR PROJECT- FOLLOWED PRIMARILY INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE MONOLINGUAL WITH SPANISH AND CANTONESE. I'M OF THIS PROJECT THEY HAD FOCUSED ON TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN AND DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT. OUTCOMES THAT REFLECTS NOT ONLY- A QUALITATIVE BUT ALSO QUANTITATIVE SO WHAT IT- THIS REPRESENTS IS THAT WE DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HIGHER COVERAGE IS A SERVICE BUT ALSO THEIR EXPERIENCES HAVE INCREASED AND- UNDERSTANDING OF SERVICE SYSTEM AND SATISFACTION WITH REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. FURTHERMORE THIS- PROPOSAL OF AND SPREADING THIS AND REPLICATING IT TO ALL TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. GIVES US A CHANCE TO- REALLY SEE STATEWIDE WHAT ARE THOSE MEANINGFUL CHANGES THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH ON THIS FOCUSED WORK ON A POPULATION AND THAT- IS NOT ACCESSING SERVICES- ONE OF THE OTHER FINDINGS THAT- EAST LA REGIONAL CENTER HAS NOTED IS THAT. WE REALLY SAW THAT FAMILIES BUILD COMPETENCIES TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE NOT ONLY THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM BUT ALSO GENERIC RESOURCES BUILDING THERE NOT ONLY CONFIDENCE BUT THEIR CONFIDENCE. IN BEING ABLE TO ADVOCATE AND- ACCESS SERVICES WHICH WILL HAVE A LIFELONG IMPACT TO THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS SERVICES GOING FORWARD- THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WOULD BE ON AN AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. WITH A ONE TO FORTY CASELOAD RATIO IT WOULD ALSO SUPPORT SUPERVISING- SUPERVISORS TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS AS WELL AS TRAINING- FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF- THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN NOTED WISE THEY'RE NOT. COMPANION. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND AS WE HAVE NOR HAD BILL LAKE- STATUE FOR RATIOS- ARE INTENT WAS TO PUT THIS AND TO PUT IT INTO THE CONTRACT WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT ALLOWS US. TO HAVE BE NIMBLE THIS YEAR AS WERE ROLLING IT OUT TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO IF WE- HAVE A NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THE APPROACH SO WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO UNIQUE REGIONAL CENTER NEEDS THAT WE CAN DO THAT. AS I NOTED- EAST LA I WORKED WITH- TO POPULATIONS WITH PARTICULAR LANGUAGE- PREFERENCES ADD EACH REGIONAL CENTERS THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IN THEIR APPROACH AND SO WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO- WORK WITH EACH OTHER REGIONAL CENTRES. THEN MOVING ON TO ABSTAINED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING ON SERVICE ABSENCE IN EQUITY AND ALSO WITH OUR EARLY START- AND- ABILITY TO HAVE APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS. IS THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY- THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY BEING AWARE OF OUR BIASES- AS WE ARE DELIVERING SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER- ON AN AREA IN WHICH I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE. EVERY REGIONAL CENTER STAFF BE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING- IT IS REALLY- OUR FOCUS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY- AND PRIORITIZE- THE ELIGIBILITY ANYBODY WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. FOR INDIVIDUALS. FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. THAT THAT IS WHERE WE WERE- OUR PHONE- FOR THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION- AND WHY IS THAT AND THAT HAS- CERTAINLY EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT- WITH- BE UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE SOME STUDIES HAVE DEFINITELY DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- WITHIN THE HEALTH- SYSTEM. HAVE OFTEN HAD HARDER TIMES IN ACCESSING SERVICES AND- BIASES. CAN COME INTO PLAY INTO THAT IMPACT ON THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM LATER THAN THOSE THAT ARE WHITE- SO BEING ABLE TO- HAD THE FRONT DOOR OF THE REGIONAL CENTER THE CLINICIANS AND THOSE. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLEFOR ELIGIBILITY THAT WE CAN REALLY SEE IF WE CAN DISRUPT THIS- CAN I SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ABSOLUTE CHANGE IT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE WANT TO. USE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR OUR CONTINUED- AREAS OF FOCUS TO AND- TO JUST WRAP THE INEQUITIES. OF SERVICES- FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND SUPPORTS TO OUR COMMUNITY SAID- HAVE FOUND IT VERY CHALLENGING TO ACCESS REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. I'D LIKE TO MOVE NOW TO- WHERE WE WERE- PROPOSING TO SUPPORT OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS THEY HAD JUST BEEN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING OVER THE YEARS CERTAINLY THE PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED- THE TIRELESS WORK OF OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS- I. FOR THAT AND BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT- THEIR EFFORT TO REALLY PROFESSIONAL LIES THIS WORKFORCE AND ESTABLISHING A TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION- FOR OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS- OUR PROPOSAL IS- IDENTIFIED AND APPRECIATE THAT- AGENDA OUTLINING CLEARLY BUT- THERE'S AN INITIAL INVESTMENT OF FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. THAT WOULD BE TO DEVELOP THEIR FRAMEWORK FOR- THAT TRAINING AND WE WOULD BE DOING AN R. F. P. AND- BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT THE PROGRAM IN WHICH- SERVICE AT THAT DIRECT SERVICE- PROFESSIONALS WOULD RECEIVE A- ADDITIONAL- HEY. NOT STATEMENT BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AT- PASSED THROUGH TO THE WAGES OF THAT DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONAL OUR VISION IS THAT W WOULD HAVE THAT WAY TO FOLLOW THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT AS THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THEIR CERTIFICATIONS- THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FROM PROVIDER TO PROVIDER. AND NOT LOSE THAT ONE LAST NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE IN OUR PROJECTION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE SERVICE PROVIDER IN THEIR EFFORT TO GIVE STAFF TIME TO GO ATTENDED THE TRAINING BY REIMBURSING THE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE STAFF TIME AS WELL AS A SLIGHT- ADMINISTRATIVE- SUPPORT. ADDITIONALLY BILINGUAL DIFFERENTIALS FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS- ALLOWING FOR DIRECT SERVICE% PROFESSIONALS TO RECIEVE A STIPEND- AT OUR ASSUMPTION WAS AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH- FOR ANY DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONAL WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS A- COMPETENCY- TEST THIS WOULD INCLUDE- ASL TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEATH. THE CONCEPT IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING OUR SERVICE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE- PREFERRED LANGUAGES OR ARE DEPENDENT ON- STAFF- WHO ARE SPEAKING A LANGUAGE BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE IN WHICH- IS IMPORTANT TO THEM AND GETTING INTO THE SERVICES. ON THAT IT DEFINITELY WE ARE INTRODUCING AND REQUESTING SUPPORT FOR- PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES- AND- THE. GENDER CORRECTLY NOTES THE FOR YEAR INVEST INTO THE PROGRAM- WE ARE- LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN REDUCING SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS- SO YOU'LL SEE AN OUT YEARS TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE. THAT THE FUNDING INCREASES TO I REQUEST AT EIGHTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF TOTAL FIND- OF WHICH THIS WOULD HAVE AN ASSUMPTION OF SUPPORTING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS- TO ADDRESS A SERVICE COORDINATOR- NEED TO- HAVE ASSURANCES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE VARIOUS NEEDS WITHIN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM- WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH- ARE STAKEHOLDERS IN DESIGNING IT BUT VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON ANY INCENTIVE. THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD BE BASED ON THE FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE- STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ALREADY SHARED COMPLIANCE WITH AGE CBS SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY- CONSUMER SATISFACTION AS WELL AS- ADVANCING THROUGH SELF DETERMINATION- AND I. WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY- ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BIRDMAN- WITH THAT WE WILL RETURN TO SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. L. TO AT HER COMMENTS ON DDS BEFORE WE RETURN TO THE DíAS. FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS MISS PATRICK. YES YOU YOU MISS CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE DDS IS ME REVISION INCLUDES MORE THAN A DOZEN NEW POLICY PROPOSAL SO AGAIN WE'RE STILL SORTING THROUGH- THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION AT THIS TIME BUT WE WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME AREAS WHERE THE- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS ALIGNED WITH PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND SOME AREAS WHERE THEY DO NOT ALIGN. SO FIRST- AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN- INDICATED THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS SERVICE ACT THANK ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES. WE'VE IDENTIFIED- SIX THOSE ARE ISSUES. 515-253-5550 SEVEN AND FIFTY EIGHT THAT HAVE A COMBINED- BUDGET YOUR COST OF FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND- AND HE'S ALSO BUILT ON TWO OTHER PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING THE GOALS OF THESE PROPOSALS- SEEM TO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN IN THE PAST. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND REDUCE DISPARITIES- PARTICULARLY ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES- FOR EXAMPLE- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING FOR GRANTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND- I WOULD ALSO NOTED THAT THIS. PARTICULAR SUB COMMITTEE OF THE ASSEMBLY. BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS VOTED TO RESTORE SOCIAL RECREATION CAMP SERVICES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN- THESE WERE NOT THESE ACTIONS WERE NOT APPROVED IN THE FINAL BUDGET ACTS OF THOSE YEARS- I MENTION THIS BECAUSE UNLIKE MOST OTHER SERVICES SOCIAL RECREATION IN CAMP IT TENDS TO HAVE- TENDED TO HAVE HIGHER PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR RELATIVE TO WHITES. SO I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS DO NOT ALIGN WITH- PREVIOUS- A LEGISLATIVE. ACTION AND INTENT- SO IT- REGARDLESS TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE MAY REVISION- LEAD TO IMPROVED ACCESS AND REDUCTIONS IN DISPARITIES THAT SEEMS TO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. ANOTHER AREA OF A OF POTENTIAL ALIGNMENT IS IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM DDS PROPOSES SEVERAL ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER ONBOARDING INTO THE PROGRAM INCLUDING ADDING PARTICIPANTS SPECIALIST INTENSIVE TRANSITION SUPPORT SERVICES AND REGIONAL CENTER TRAINING. I'D NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A POLICY BILL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO IMPLEMENT THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM SO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED CHANGES. EASE ENROLLMENT AND HE SAID AND SUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS INTO THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD SEEM IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ANY INTERESTED CONSUMER. I AM FINALLY AREAS OF ALIGNMENT AND THE ELIMINATION OF SUSPENSIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES AND UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. THERE ARE A FEW KEY AREAS WHERE- I LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN REVISION THE FIRST I'D MENTION IS REFORM. THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TO REQUIRE A RATE STUDY- THIS REPORT I WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN IT IDENTIFIED ISSUES IN THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPROVE IT AN ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD COST TO THE STATE AROUND ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT A RATE REFORM IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SINCE THEN RATE INCREASES TOTALING MORE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES TOTALING MORE THAN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN APPROVED THAT RATE RESTRUCTURING AND FULL FUNDING OF A RATE REFORM HAVE NOT. THE SECOND AREA WHERE I WOULD NOTE- THAT SPENDING REVISION DOES NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. IS IN THE AREA OF DIRECTIVES ISSUED DURING THE PANDEMIC SO ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DEMOCRATIC BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE STAFF. I HAVE MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DISCUSS CODIFYING SOME OF THE DIRECTIVES ISSUED DURING THE PANDEMIC SUCH AS VIRTUAL PROVISION OF EARLY START SERVICES OR VIRTUAL SERVICE COORDINATION MEETINGS IN ADDITION- THE SENATE DEMOCRATS IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER THREE EXPRESSED IT'S- PRIORITIES TO CODIFY SOME OF THESE DIRECTIVES ITS ME SIX HEARING. THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY PROPOSALS CONCERNING CODIFICATION OF DIRECTIVES- I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH NOTING- SOME ISSUES THAT OUR OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED IN SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT MEET REVISION. THE FIRST CONCERNS THE PROPOSED PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES PROGRAM WHICH WAS FIRST PROPOSED IN A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL LIKELY HAS MERIT IF IT'S DONE IF IT'S DONE WELL WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS OF HOW IT WOULD WORK JUST YET. HOWEVER WE DID HAVE CONCERNS IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT STILL REMAIN SO UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE SYSTEM ARE NUMEROUS CHALLENGES STRAIN THE SYSTEM INCLUDING SERVICE PROVIDER RATE ISSUES. AND SERVICE COORDINATOR TWO CONSUMER CASELOAD RATIOS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WE HAVE TO WONDER IF THE- PROGRAM WOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A FOUNDATION CONDUCIVE TO SUCCESS. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS BASED ON THE REMARKS OF DIRECTOR BARGE MINIMUM GONNA GO. THAT FUNDING WOULD BE INCLUDED- IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS WELL THE FIRST YEAR WOULD BE FOR PLANNING AND THEN IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THERE WOULD BE SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR- TO HIRE MORE SERVICE COORDINATORS. IT IS WE WOULD KNOW THAT IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO SPEND A YEAR PLANNING- THIS PROGRAM PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR TO US WHY THE STATE WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR TO FIND MORE SERVICE COORDINATORS WHEN THIS IS A CLEARLY IDENTIFIED PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM. I'M FINALLY- WE WOULD NOTE THAT ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S ME REVISION PROPOSALS FOR DDS- THAT MOST PROPOSALS- EAT AND INCLUDING THOSE THAT WOULD ADDRESS SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES- MAY HAVE MERIT BUT LACKS SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WAS DERIVED AND WHETHER THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT- AND HOW THE PROGRAMS WOULD BE HE DESIGNED- FOR US TO CONDUCT. A FULL ASSESSMENT NOR IS IT CLEAR TO US NECESSARILY HOW OUTCOMES WOULD BE TRACKED AND REPORTED BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS PENNOCK WE WILL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH A SIMPLE NUMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SKEWS ME. WHERE DO YOU BEGIN- YOU KNOW AGAIN ON THE SOCIAL WRECK. AS YOU KNOW THE RECORDS OF PROGRAMS- I DID A SURVEY IN MY DISTRICT AND ASKED ALL THE RECREATION DEPARTMENT'S IN THE CITIES IF THEY HAD PROGRAMS OR OR PAUL ORDER PEOPLE IN PLACE. TO WORK WITH THE I. D. D. POPULATION. AND NOT ONE OF MY CITIES ACTUALLY HAD THE ABILITY OR ANY PROGRAM FOR ANYBODY WITH DISABILITIES. NOBODY. SO THIS IS IMPERATIVE A PROGRAM THAT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED AGAIN WITH THE INCLUSION AND ALSO THE DIVERSITY CAN OCCUR THE SELF ESTEEM THE DIGNITY THERE PROVIDES SOCIALIZING I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON BUT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT REALLY DOES NEED BECAUSE IT'S NOT ADOPTED ANY WHERE. ELSE IN THE STATE. COUNTY CITY ANYWHERE ELSE. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE- MAKE THAT IMPRESSION VERY LARGE THEN THIS IS. MORTON FACET. AND I APPRECIATE ONE OF THINGS I HAVE TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE. IS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT- DDS AFFORDED THE PROVIDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC I TO BE ABLE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND- WORK- TO ADAPT TO THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE SO. YOU KNOW KUDOS TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THAT IT WAS A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR POPULATION- THE- THE EARLY START PROGRAM. TO ME IS JUST ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE AUTISM UP FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT ARE. PRECLUDED FROM AN I. E. P. OR LESSENED I E. P. OR THEIR- OR THEIR- YOU KNOW REGIONAL CENTER NEEDS JUST WITH US EARLY INVESTMENT IS SUCH A BUSINESS MOVE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS INVESTMENT TO CAPTURES MUCH OF SUCCESS FOR THESE YOUNG CHILDREN AS WE CAN. ON IT AND I EMPLOYER THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO- PUSH THAT OF GOING FOR BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE IN OUR FIRST FIVE TWELVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND LOOK AT ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT. THERE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE- THE DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AN OUTGOING YEAR JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. AS I AGREE WITH THE L. A. O. WE HAVE THIS ABILITY TO DO THE PLANNING BUT WE WE'VE KNOWN THAT WE'VE BEEN SHORT THESE. HE'S INDIVIDUALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME. AND JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD TO BE ABLE TO. ADD THAT ADDITIONAL A HUNDRED WE'RE AT NINE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING I BELIEVE SHORT.RIGHT NOW- BUT WE'VE WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CATCH UP- IF WE JUST CONTINUE THIS IS JUST A DISSERVICE TO THE- INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WANT TO CARE. FOR TO THE AT LANHAM ACT. AND ALL YOU KNOW I'LL JUST QUOTE YOU KNOW OUR CHAIRS OF CONCERN. I WILL ANIMAX STATE OR NOT. THAT IS THE QUESTION. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PURPOSE OF THE LETTERMAN ACT IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE TO THE INDIVIDUALS. IN THE IDT COMMUNITY AND ALL PEOPLE DISABILITIES- YOU KNOW. I JUST I CAN'T FATHOM WHY WE WOULD WAIT. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IMPERATIVE SPECIALLY IN SUCH A HUGE BUDGET SURPLUS ARENA OKAY- NOW THE OTHER THING WAS THE- I THINK IT WAS THE- I HAVE A SIMILAR HAVE A BILLS KIND OF ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CERTIFICATION TRAINING. I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO MINISTRATION. YEAH AND MYSELF CAN HOW ARE GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING THE STATUTORY INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW OF THE GOAL AND PURPOSE- IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE THIS WORKFORCE WITH ADEQUATE TRAINING BECAUSE OF THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE OR THE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES OR IN ANY OF THE OTHER. OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE IN IN THAT WORK FORCE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A TURNOVER RATE THAT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE- HOW AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED TO GET INTO THIS BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TO CREATE A CURRICULUM. TO CREATE SOMETHING LIKE A CNA. TO GO FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FOLKS. I HAVE A CLEAR PATH FORWARD. IF THEY CHOOSE TO OR BUT WE HAVE A RETENTION OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT BEING IN THIS WORKSPACE. HELPING THIS POPULATION- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE WE'VE KNOWN THAT THERE'S A HIGH TURNOVER THE PEOPLE THAT I TALKED TO. IN MY DISTRICT IN AROUND THE STATE FROM OUR FRIENDS THE IDT POPULATION SAY THAT THE CONSISTENCY OF CARE IS. NOT THERE THE TURNOVER IS HIGH- YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY FLIPPING BURGERS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT FLIPPING BURGERS IS A GREAT PROFESSION IS A WE WANT TO THE FACT POPULATION TO ANOTHER WORKFORCE ALSO. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE. A HUGE EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WORK FORCE IS THERE TO CARE FOR THE FOLKS AND WE'RE GOING FORWARD ON THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM I'VE HAD AN INSPECTION AND PARTNERED WITH THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS I'VE HAD IN TERMS OF MY OFFICE IN THE CAPITAL IN THE DISTRICT FOR YEARS NOW. AND HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE AND LEARN I LEARNED FROM MY FOLKS TO COME IN AND HELP ME BE A BETTER LEGISLATURE IN THIS WORLD ALSO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO IN THE WORK FORCE TRAINING. COMPONENT VIA THIS MAY BE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU KNOW TAX CREDITS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HIRED BY EMPLOYERS TO GO OUT. AND BE SUCCESSFUL- I'VE TOURED THE ART PROGRAMS WHERE THEY HAVE THESE PROGRAMS AND- AND THE JUST THE IT JUST HOW PROUD THEY ARE TO BE ABLE TO BE FUNCTIONING IN THIS CAPACITY TO HELP. OTHERS IS SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE. ONE OF THEM AS DIRECTOR BARS MISSES SOME OF THE BEST EMPLOYEES I'VE SEEN IS. LOYALTY ON TIME THEIR QUALITY OF WORK IS IMPECCABLE- SO. AND I'LL JUST FINISH WITH THIS YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED THAT WE PAID THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RATE STUDY. IT DID COME TO US A FEW YEARS AGO. WE HAVE BEEN MAKING- SOME EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THAT IMPLEMENTED- BUT- SO DO WE HAVE A COMEBACK PLAN. BECAUSE THAT COME BACK PLAN WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THIS POPULATION WITH THIS DEFICIENCY THAT WE HAVE TO FIND AND SAY HERE WE ARE NOW WE CAN DO IT- ARE WE JUST GOING TO COME BACK AND BASICALLY. GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE PRE PANDEMIC THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN POPULATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF THE CUTS OF REVENUE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THEIR BACKS EVERY YEAR WHEN I'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY. YOU KNOW OF FOR THIRTY YEARS FOR THAT WERE FUNDING. ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS PER PERSON NOW THAN WE WERE THIRTY YEARS AGO NOT INCLUDING INFLATION. AND SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN THE PASSION. OF THE CHAIR AND- SOME MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO THAT WE COME THROUGH FOR THIS POPULATION SAME. I'M NOT HAS ENOUGH. YOU DO MATTER AND I AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS THE COME BACK HERE FOR YOU THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO GIVE DIRECTOR PARCHMENT A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER'S COMMENTS BEFORE RETURNING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO DIRECTOR. THE SHERIN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER- I'LL I'LL TRY TO TOUCH SOME OF THE- THE POINTS THAT THAT YOU MADE AND- FIRST- WE ARE ALWAYS I'M INTERESTED IN SUPPORT OF A WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND SEEING HOW TO THINK THROUGH- ANY OF THE QUESTIONS AND- CONTINUE TO- OFFERED THAT AS AS WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS- ON HOW WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH OTHER INITIATIVES- AS WE GO. I WILL I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE- THE AREA OF- SOCIAL RANK YOU HAD NOTED- AND WHILE IT MAY NOT BE GETTING TO- EVERY POINT THAT YOU HAD HAD MADE. WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE ADVANCING THE STAFF THAT ARE SUPPORTED TO INDIVIDUALS- AND ALL SERVICES THAT ARE PROPOSAL ON I'M LOOKING AT THE- BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIAL PROFESSIONAL ICE IN THE WORK FORCE- BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT MANY OF THE FAMILIES- ARE USING STAFF THAT ARE COMING IN TO PROVIDE SUPPORTS. WELL IT'S NOT PENDING THE SOCIAL RECREATION ACTIVITY BUT THERE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TIED TO RESPITE OR MAKING SURE THAT THE SUPPORTS ARE THERE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF THAT ARE THERE TO HELP- ANY INDIVIDUAL WHETHER THEY'RE CHILDREN OR ADULTS AND ENGAGE IN THE COMMUNITY- THAT THEY ARE TRAINED AND THAT THEY'RE READY TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS. ON ON THAT DISCUSSION AROUND THE GRANT PROGRAM OR LOOKING AT HOW TO AND ENHANCE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AS INTERNS- AND WE'RE SEEING MORE THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHIN THE STATE AND REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO. ADVANCING EMPLOYMENT ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE INVESTMENT IN THE GRAY AXES THAT AS WE DID WITH A DESPAIR GRANT WE REALLY FOUND IT AN OP. TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING SOMETHING NOW WE CAN GET INNOVATIVE YOU KNOW AND IT CAN HELP US INFORM- FUTURE PROPOSALS ARE POLICIES. ON REALLY HOW TO MAKE THAT MEANINGFUL CHANGE SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW IN ADDITION TO OUR COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS AND THEN- WITH THE- PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHAB. USING THIS TO SEE ARE THERE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY INNOVATIVE AND BEING ABLE TO- SEE WHAT WE CAN BUILD UPON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- REALLY LOOK AT OF MOVING US FORWARD ON THE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES AND HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND WE ARE CONTINUING OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY- AND SEEING HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE STILL MEETING THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE- EVERYBODY IS AT DIFFERENT PHASES AND SO ARE THEY COUNTIES AS TO HOW INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING BACK INTO SERVICES- SO AS WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THIS YEAR- WE DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE DID DURING THE PANDEMIC. THAT PROVIDED THE PROVIDERS AND THEN INDIVIDUALS THE FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE A PERSON CENTERED APPROACH TO ACCESSING SERVICES- THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME IN CONVERSATION THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING- AS WE CONTINUE TO- RE ENGAGE INTO. ACCESSING COMMUNITY SERVICES AND CONNECTING PEOPLE BACK TO THOSE SERVICES- THAT THEY WANT TO RETURN TO OR IF THEY WANT TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE- SO I. I MAY NOT HAVE TOUCHED ALL YOUR ITEMS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANYTHING THAT- MAYBE I DIDN'T TOUCH ON THAT IS- MISTER CHAIR THAT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE I CIRCLE BACK TO. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WITH THAT WE WILL NOW GO TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK ONTO MR ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER'S POINT- WE WANT TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE BILL NUMBER COMMUNITIES AND IN THIS CASE THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY BUT AND THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THE THEME ACROSS. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS IS THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING PROVIDERS- YOU KNOW A SUSTAINABLE WEIGHT OR IN SOME CASES A LIVABLE WAGE SO WE- WANT TO- SUPPORT ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES BUT IF WE DON'T PAY OUR OUR PROVIDERS ENOUGH FOR- IT'S ONE THING TO TRAIN THEM BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE LIVABLE WAGES- BUT TURNOVER HAS BEEN REALLY REALLY HIGH. IN ALL OF THE PROGRAMS NOT JUST THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM I HAVE A BILL FOR FFA'S- TO TRY TO GET HIM BACK TO A LIVABLE WAGE BY. YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD OR EVEN NOW ARE WE EVEN CONSIDERING REINSTATING A LOT OF THESE- SALARIES THAT WERE CUT- OR THE PROVIDER- FEES THAT WERE CUT BUT EVEN MOVING FORWARD I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT EVERY TIME THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME KIND OF A BUDGETARY ISSUE. WE ARE QUICK TO CUT THE PAY OF THE PROVIDERS AND WE CAN NOT HAVE OUTCOMES- IF WE KEEP DOING THAT THE CONTINUITY FORCED SOME OF THE VULNERABLE PUBLIC POPULATIONS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE I'M A FORMER TEACHER AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF THOSE. THE STUDENTS THAT I SAW BOUNCED FROM HOUE TO HOUSE SEARCH IN THIS CASE IN SOME CASES FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL AND THOSE WERE THE KIDS THAT I SAW THERE WERE MORE- FARTHER BEHIND OR HAD A LOT OF ISSUES. AND THOSE ARE THE SITUATION I'M PRESENTING RIGHT NOW WAS BECAUSE THE FAMILIES WERE MOVING RIGHT SO THAT THOSE ARE THE REASONS IN THESE CASES WERE NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH- SUPPORT FOR THE PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MOVE ON- BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO JUST FEED THEIR OWN FAMILIES. ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE AND SO I AT WHAT POINT IN AGAIN WE HAVE A- WE'VE SAID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS IS A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME OF THESE ISSUES COVER RIGHT- YOU KNOW ALL THE THEME FOR THE PANDEMIC THAT THEME FOR. FOR RECOVERY IS GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY GET IN LIFTING PEOPLE OUT. SO WE CANNOT LIFT PEOPLE UP OF WE DON'T ALSO LEFT OF PROVIDERS UP AND TO MR FRASER'S POINT. YES THE TRAINING IS REALLY CRITICAL INCENTIVES ARE CRITICAL SO THAT THE CONTINUITY FOR ALL OF THESE POPULATIONS- YOU KNOW CONTINUE IN SEOUL. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO- THINK ABOUT OR ARE IS ARE ARE DEPARTMENTS REALLY THINKING ABOUT RESTORING SOME OF THOSE THOSE- PROVIDER WAGES ARE PROVIDER- MONIES. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE REQUESTING YOU KNOW FROM ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS IN THIS CASE- BUT TO MR FRASER'S POINT THE IDT POPULATION AND- YOU KNOW JUST- OUR FOSTER KIDS ALL OF THOSE. ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS NEEDS CONTINUITY AND IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THE LIVING WAGES- TO THOSE PROVIDERS THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE QUALIFIED AND REALLY TALENTED PROVIDERS ARE WALKING WANTING TO. PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES BUT THEY CAN'T LIVE ON THE WAGES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. SOLD A LONG WINDED BUT- WANTED TO. A MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET MAKE. THE PROVIDER FEES TO STAY IN A BALL. NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO IS. THE IT BUT THINKING UP THE BOX. I THINK RIGHT NOW WE JUST NEED TO THINK YOU KNOW RATIONALLY AND YOU KNOW- WE NEED TRAINING WE NEED. NOT STUFF OUTSIDE THE BOX WE NEED THINGS THAT ARE REALLY LIKE BASIC- TO- THE POPULATION BUT ALSO TOOK TO THE PROVIDERS. THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX IS LEFT FOR WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE MONEY AND AGAIN WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE THIS RIGHT SO I THINK THAT I'M ASKING AND REQUESTING THAT BEFORE WE THINK OUT THE BOX LET'S JUST DO THE BASIC THINGS FIRST. AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT OUTSIDE THE BOX- IN FROM OUR- I'M THINKING WE NEED A DEAL- SO ANYWAY AGAIN LONG WINDED BUT- ARE WE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT STABILIZING A LOT OF THESE RATES FOR JUST THE CLASS BUBBLE NUMBER POPULATION THAT WE'RE SERVING THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT- AND TO. CAN WE TALK ABOUT- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER'S- SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE ATTRACT AND TRAIN- NEW PROVIDERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO- I LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT- THAT I THINK MAKE IT TOO- ANSWERING SOME OF YOUR QUESTION- WE REALLY ARE. YOU KNOW PUTTING FORWARD A PROPOSAL WITHIN THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING- THAT IS IDENTIFYING A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING THE TRAINING TO THE STAFF AND CERTIFICATION PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY PROFESSIONAL LICE. THE DRUG SERVICE- PROFESSIONALS THAT- ARE DOING THEIR DAILY WORK. THEN AGAIN IT'S FOR TWO THINGS ONE IS TO SUPPORT ALL OF THEIR GOOD WORK BUT IT ALSO IS TO ACHIEVE REALLY STRONG OUTCOMES FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THEIR SURNAME- ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I CAN HIGHLIGHT MORE IS THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT TIER LEVEL OUR PROPOSAL IS THIS TO MEAN. THAT THERE'S A TIER ONE AND TIER TWO EIGHT TIER THREE THAT WOULD BE- DESIGNED TO GO ON TOP OF EXISTING TRAINING FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS I'M ENTITLED TO THAT UPON COMPLETION OF THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE A BOY AGED- ENHANCEMENT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL SO ARE SUBSTANCE LOOKING AT A DOLLAR TO TWO DOLLARS MORE AN HOUR. THAT THAT STAFF PERSON WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- POTENTIALLY FOR EVERY TIER LEVEL- SO AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO SAY THAT IS THAT IS THAT KIND OF THAT CONCEPT I'M GOING TO AFFECT THE INTEREST AND MEANINGFUL CHANGE. YOU KNOW TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THAT MEANINGFUL WAITS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND THEN FOR THE INDIVIDUALS ARE SERVING AND SUPPORTING THAT THEY GET THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS AN EXAMPLE WE HAD DESIGNED SOME NEW MODELS OF SERVICE. WHICH WAS REALLY GREAT WE NEEDED TO DO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD IN- RATES TO SUPPORT- THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE HIRING- REGISTERED BEHAVIOR TECHNICIANS. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE A WORKFORCE THAT IS ABLE TO ADVANCE IN THEIR TRAINING AND SO- WITHOUT- REGARD TO THE TYPE OF SERVICE SO IF YOU'RE PROVIDING RESPITE SUPPORT IF THEY'RE PROVIDING- SUPPORT THROUGH SUPPORTED LIVING YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT AREAS BUT THERE'S PROFESSIONAL STAFF PROFESSIONALS THAT- THAT PROVIDERS CAN HIRE OR OR- THEY CAN STEP. TO THAT TO YOUR LEVELS OF. ON THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING THAT PAY DIFFERENTIAL- FOR SUSTAINABILITY GOING FORWARD- IF THE I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE A NOTE BECAUSE I. ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT ABOUT KIND OF THE INNOVATION. YOU KNOW I MIGHT- I I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AND THINK HOW DO WE GET SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS- BUT THE EXAMPLE THAT I PROVIDED WAS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE GRANT PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE EMPLOYMENT. SO WHILE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE OTHER IMPORTANT AREAS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD WITH WAYS TO ADVANCE POLICIES THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO BE POSITIVE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. AND HELPING INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO HAVE- CONSUMERS- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR- LIVING WAGE THEMSELF IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PARALLEL ALL OF THESE EFFORTS- LASTLY I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT. AS MISS PEDICAB NOTED- THAT ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS FOR THE EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT- GREAT ADJUSTMENTS- AND THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY THAT THOSE TWO ITEMS ARE- PROPOSED TO BE SUSPENDED I'M GOING FORWARD SO THOSE ARE THE PROPOSALS THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE- AND TO PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS AND- AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOLLOWED BY FRAZIER. THANK YOU SO I DO HAVE A SUGGESTION- FOR THE PROPOSED ON THE TIERED SYSTEM AND I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL- AS A TEACHER- WHEN I STARTED TEACHING- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THE PAY SCALE MODEL FOR TEACHERS YOU GO BUY IT BY ROLES IN COLUMNS FIRST. FIRST COLUMN IS BASICALLY A BRAND NEW TEACHER FIRST ROW MEANS THE FIRST YEAR OF TEACHING BUT IT WAS UP TO US TO ADVANCING COLUMNS YOU WOULD GET CONTINUING EDUCATION WHICH RESULTED IN TRAINING. THAT I DECIDED THAT I KNEW I WANTED TO TAKE- BECAUSE THEN I COULD MOVE DOWN DOT COM THE- COLUMNS IN THE PAY SCALE AND SOULS. MAINLY IT'S OPTIONAL BUT IT RESULTED IN ME BEING ABLE TO EARN MORE BY THAT RESULT IN THE SCHOOL GAINING A MORE QUALIFIED TEACHER BECAUSE MY- TRAINING- WAS WAS. MORE THAN YOU KNOW ANYBODY ELSE ON THE EXAMPLE IS I AM THAT MY T. R. I AM STILL IN THE LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM MY IRA I AM IN COLUMN F. WHICH IS THE MASTER'S DEGREE PLUS SIXTY ADDITIONAL ARE CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS AND THAT WAS BY CHOICE I PAID FOR ALL OF IT MYSELF. BUT THE RESULT FOR ME WAS THAT I WAS ABLE TO ADVANCE IN MY SALARY- BUT AGAIN SO IT'S A WIN WIN IN MY OPINION FOR ALL I GOT- I WAS ABLE TO INCREASE MY SALARY. BASED ON WHAT I DID AND ON THE SCHOOL GOT A BETTER QUALIFIED AND MORE EDUCATED TEACHER MORE TRAINED TEACHER BECAUSE- THAT WAS THE INCENTIVE AND I AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL BUT IF WE CAN. INSTEAD OF TEARS SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT SOMETHING AND THAT. RESPECT IT WOULD HELP- FAVOR OF FIRST OF ALL MOTIVATE ARE IN PLACE TO GET MORE CONTINUING EDUCATION BUT ALSO THE INCENTIVE IS GETTING MORE WAGES BY WANTED TO. ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE KEEP WANTING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL THEN YOU KNOW- I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR- ISSUE AS WE ALL. LIVE IN SEITEL'S HERE AND IF WE IT TOOK SOME OF GOOD FROM A OTHER- KIND OF- DEPARTMENTS I THINK WE WOULD. FIND THAT WERE ALSO- WANTING THE SAME THING AND I THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL SO WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT- IN TERMS OF YOUR- QUOTE DIED TIERED SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK THAT- SELF MOTIVATION IS. IS ALWAYS. MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEY'RE ALREADY DEDICATED. AND IF THEY WERE INCENTIVIZED TO GET MORE EDUCATION I THINK- YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A WORK FOR MORE CONSISTENT WORK FORCE THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU. CHECK WOULD YOU MIND IF I CLARIFY ONE THING SORRY FOR FRAZIER PLEASE YES- THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AYE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AND PUT IN THE CONTEXT TO NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL- WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES THIS OTHER WITHIN YOU KNOW STATE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA BUT OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AS WELL- I FAILED TO NOTE THAT- ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. SO IT WOULD BE THAT- DATE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER TO ATTEND THIS ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND IN RETURN THAT HAVE THAT HIGHER WAGE- SO WE REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING AT OTHER SYSTEMS BECAUSE LIKE YOU IT'S RATHER NOT REINVENT SOMETHING IF THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS THAT WE CAN USE TO BRING IT TOGETHER SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- DR APARTMENT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAD A HEARING I THINK WAS LAST WEEK- ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH- THE- COMPONENT IN OUR BUDGET. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS GLARINGLY ABSENT AND. OPERATION WITH THAT AGENCY AND YOUR AGENCY. TO JUSTICE IN THE COMPONENT DUALLY DIAGNOSED- COME- INDIVIDUALS NOW. AND I'M WONDERING I KNOW YOU. I'M REALLY PROUD THAT YOU- PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT REAL QUICK REHABILITATION. AND THROUGH THE PENDANT YOU EVEN- PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- IN SERVICES- AND COLLABORATION WHICH- BUT THIS IS BEEN. KIND OF A COMPONENT THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY IMPRESSION HAS BEEN GLARINGLY ABSENT- AND VERY AS- SOMEONE. SAYING VERY SILO. AND WONDERING IF WE CAN- RESOURCES. AN ECONOMY OF SCALE. TO BE ABLE I'D IN AND CAPTURE. OF NOT SO MUCH SIX BUT HOW COME FOR IN. WHO WHO. WHO ARE IS OTHER REGIONAL CENTER BUT THEN HARPER COMPLETELY DISTANCE FROM. THE ABILITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE HI IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S SO FRACTURED. AND COULD YOU SAY. WHAT IN THE BUDGET IS ADDRESSING THAT OR IF IT IS THERE A NEED TO COMBINE. THE TWO AGENCIES TOLD TO PUT A LINE ITEM. THAT WOULD ADDRESSES. THANK YOU SOME OF THEM FRAZIER- IT HAS BEEN- REMARKABLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS COUPLE YEARS- UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND INTERESTS TO DO CROSS CUTTING WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ARE ARE REALLY LOOKING TO SERVE AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON- SOME REALLY REALLY STRONG EXAMPLES- YOU- JUST BEFORE THIS YOU YOU HEARD SOME OF THAT- REAL POSITIVE EFFORTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- AND- THE WORK. UNDER THE TWENTY EIGHTY THREE WHICH IS FOR THOSE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE- THAT ARE INVOLVED IN TOOL AGENCIES THAT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF HOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT THEN ALMOST EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT OR EVEN SOMETIMES I'D ARGUE MORE IMPORTANT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE THIS COLLABORATIVE IS HAPPENING WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR COUNTIES AND REGIONAL CENTERS- AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS EDUCATION OR PROBATION WORKING TOGETHER TO. JUST SERVICE SUPPORT THE SAME CHILD- THAT IS- ONE EXAMPLE- THAT HAS REALLY BEEN AN AREA IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU KNOW AS WE CONTINUE AS AN APARTMENT TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE ALSO TOUCHING WERE EXPLORING TOGETHER- WITHIN- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT AGENCIES AS TO WHAT ARE THOSE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE- THAT WERE ADDRESSING IN ORDER PARTNERING AND ADVANCING AN EXAMPLE AND WHERE WE WNT TO DO MORE OF THAT- AND WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITHIN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. YES REALLY THOSE CHILDREN WHO HAVE A DUAL DIAGNOSIS- FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAD MAY HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AN INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND THEN HAVE A CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. AND SEEING THEM THIS IS BAND AID CHALLENGE FOR MANY YEARS- AND BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PROPOSAL'S THAT ARE NOT ONLY WITHIN. SERVICES BUT OTHER DEPART- I WAS- LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENCE- PROPOSALS BUT THEN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE REALLY GREAT LANDS THAT HAD BEEN A COMMON THREAD- BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR FAN. YOU KNOW WHO RECEIVE REGIONAL SAID SERVICE- MANY OF THE ARE RECEIVING SERVICES FROM. TO PART. SO WE AS A APART ALSO HOW THE RISK OF. TO I. WHAT WITH SERVE. AT BELL OR THOSEAND POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO. OUR PA. AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE A FORM TO. SO WE CAN BE OGETHER IT'S A MANY OF THE INITIAL- YOU KNOW ALWAYS MORE TO BE DONE- AND KEEPING- THAT IMPORTANT LANDS OF WORKING IN A PERSON CENTRED APPROACH- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL AS A SYSTEM YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S- DDS OR OTHER SYSTEMS. AND SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO- PRIORITIZING ON THOSE EFFORTS. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE- FOR A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE I'D FIRST LIKE TO. START BY THANKING DR EVR FOR DIRECTOR THE SAME EXCUSE ME AFTER THE WORK DONE IN THE OF RE. I'D LIKE TO **** MICHAEL ON TO THE- AND REALLY WHAT LIKE TO THANK THE- FOR A FOCUS ON INCLUSION. AND EQUITY AS I BELIEVE THAT ITEMS NUMBER. FIFTY ONE FIFTY THREE FIFTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN AND FIFTY EIGHT. ARE NEEDED FOR US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS BUT WAS HOPING TO TAKE INTO ITEM FIFTY THREE IF I COULD DIRECTOR. SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE AGENDA WE WERE TRYING TO ASK FOR TRAILER BILL- FOR US AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING FOR. IS AN OUTLINE FOR REPORTING BACK HOW THIS INVESTMENT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH PURCHASE OF SERVICES THAT WE'RE SEEING. FOR MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON. THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AS NOTED WE- WE'RE LOOKING TO. HAVE THE- WORK THROUGH WITH THAT REGIONAL CENTER THROUGH THE CONTRACT HOWEVER IT DOESN'T TAKE THE- RESPONSIBILITY OF REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN ALSO THAT THE BENEFITS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO- AND ALREADY IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT- ON THE ON SET. UP THE DELIVERY OF THE ENHANCE CASELOAD BUT THEN ALSO AS INDIVIDUALS FINISHED- WORKING WITH THEIR- SERVICE COORDINATOR IN THIS CASE LOAD SO WE WOULD HAVE A PRE AND A POST AND HAVE STANDARD MEASURES ACROSS THE STATE- WE HAVE- A NUMBER OF AREAS IN WHICH- WE REPORT TO THE- THROUGH THE OUR QUARTERLY BRIEFINGS WITH LET'S STAFF. AND I WOULD SEE THIS IS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON HOW AND WHERE WE ARE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW IN IDENTIFYING THE MEASURES TO WEAR REGIONAL CENTERS ARE BY REGIONAL CENTER IN IMPLEMENTING IT AND- MONITORING THE PROGRESS ON BOTH ON IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN- ON THE- TAIL END OF IT. I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS IS TO THE APPROACH OF HOW TO- MEMORIALIZE THAT- WITH THIS COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY SEND IT HAS BEEN PRIME FOR THE COMMITTEE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND NINE FOR TO FOCUS ON. SOCIAL CAN WRECKED I WOULD IN. AND TWENTY TWENTY THAT WERE ALSO GOING TO LEAN IN. AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THESE SERVICES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE RELYING UPON FOR- THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SERVICE FOR OUR FAMILIES. WOULD LIKE TO NOW TURN TO ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY SEVEN. AND REALLY WASN'T CURRENT FIVE THIS PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO GET UPSTREAM OF MANY PROBLEMS AND IDENTIFY. THOSE WHO NEED RESOURCES BUT WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON HOW THIS HELPS INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. IN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY. AND I AM. MISTER CHAIR THAT I'M. JUST SOMEHOW LAW CONNECT ON MY CAN YOU REMIND THAT ITEM COULD SEVEN IT'S LAND FOR AN ACT ALLEGE. FOR THE REGIONAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT- YES SO IT NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE- DO THAT WE ARE. MON IS BY SO. WE ARE TO AS WE TOOK ALL AT THE DETAIL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD LEFT- EARLY START AND THEN RETURNS TO LETTERMAN SERVICES THAT THAT'S HOW WE HAD IDENTIFIED. A NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THEN AS I SAID- THE PANDEMIC DEFINITELY- INCREASED THE URGENCY AND IN ADDRESSING THAT HAVING A PROPOSAL TO- ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE ALREADY HAVE DATA- BASED ON ETHNICITY AND THEN ALSO LANGUAGE- BY REGIONAL CENTER SO WE CAN TRACK- THAT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS- THAT. ARE LEAVING EARLY START AND THAT HAVE RETURNED BUT WE CAN ALSO START TRACKING ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS NEW PROVISION- BY ETHNICITY BY REGIONAL CENTER AND THEN ALSO COMPARE THAT TO BOTH EARLY START. AND LETTERMAN SERVICES- I WOULD ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WOULD BE A MEASURE- THAT WE COULD WOULD WANT TO USE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AT LOOKING AT PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL. TO BE ABLE TO TRACK- SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY- AND- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BRING IN KIDS- FROM DIFFERENT ETHNIC. GROUPS THAT ARE UNDERREPRESENTED. THANK YOU. I'M AND SO MY QUESTIONS- WANTING TO A THE RATE STUDY REALLY WANTING TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. TO BETTER ON- WHAT WHAT I FEEL WAS ONE IF NOT BE MY GLARING TO WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. REGARDING OUR INABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS RATE STUDY INSULTS WANTED UNDERSTAND. FROM YOU WHETHER OR NOT THERE.

THANK YOU AND WE HAD- THAT. WITH THE RATE STUDY THE RATE MODEL- WORD. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY. AB HELPED INFORM A- OF. OVER THE SEVERAL YEARS- YEAH I AS WE LOOK AT EVEN THE AMPLE. OF THE EIGHT POINT 2% THAT HELPED INFORM AND THEN WE HAD ALSO USED THE RATE STUDY IN RATE MODELS- TO REALLY AMP OUR TIER PROPOSAL FOR THE DRUG SERVICE PROFESSIONALS- WE CONTINUE TO- MAY BE OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS AS WORK HAD BEEN ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT NOW. ON HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD AND- ALTERNATIVE SERVICES AND WHAT DOES ALTERNATIVE SERVICES LOOK LIKE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ON PERSON CENTERED APPROACHES AND THEN ANY INTERSECTION THAT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH- REIMBURSEMENTS- SO AT THIS TIME THE PROPOSALS THAT- WE PUT FORWARD OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY BUT WE HAVE NOT- PUT A PROPOSAL IN- FOR- IMPLEMENTATION. FULL IMPLEMENTATION. OR WOULD YOU ECHO ENOUGH THE OF MANY PEOPLE ON THE DIE HERE FOR NOT TO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. OR TO THANK OUTSIDE OF THE BALL BUT TO TOWARD. WHAT WE FOR ASISTIR IN THIS RATES TO AND LOW TO THE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY MADE WITHIN A- AS A REAL MAP. US AS A STATE TO BE PER. WITH THAT I DO LOOK FOR TO THOSE CAN KERR.

TO SUPPORT IN A OLDER ADULTS AND THE A INTO. SERVICES THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGE. IS OLD ADULTS AND OUR SERVICE NETWORK BACK FOR THE DEFICIT PANDA. AND IS TO GET WE IN BY PLAN AGING AND BUILD A CALIFORNIA ALL A. TODAY ALL PRESENT VERY. ON THE- TARGETED. AT THE OF A- TO ADDRESS. THAT BECAME MORE SO DURING THE PAN- TALKING WILL BE THAT'S- DURING THE PAST FOURTEEN. AND- OVERALL SUPPORT OLDER AND FOR. LIVING IN THE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. OF THEIR CHOICE. THEREFORE ISSUES WHICH OPERATES SUMMARIZE AND ONE QUESTION WHICH ALL OF. ISSUE SEVENTY ABOUT HOW OR WE CALL THE- COMMUNITY BASED ON SERVICE. THIS IS A WORK PROPOSAL WE ARE ALL SORT OF OVER. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. EITHER SERVING THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CLIENTS AND THIS PROPOSAL OF ONE EIGHT FIVE AND TWENTY ONE TWO. AND TWO POINT ONE EIGHT ON GOING. WOULD ALLOW US TO. MEET THE GROWING TO BE ABLE A AND THIRTY TWO APPLES BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. WITH MORE PROVIDERS TO SERVE A MARKET MORE PEOPLE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS- I TO TRY FROM. GIVEN THAT URGENCY OF THE ISSUE. A SPECIFICALLY THIS IS ABOUT HOW FOR EXPAND. TO OLDER ADULTS THE WORK OUR AGING. TO REACH OLDER. ON THE IS A PARTNER WITH THE- OF SERVICES. TO DOLLAR ON GO. INTO THE WORK BEGAN WITH THE EMBLEM. OF CAL EXPAND. TO PARTICULARLY TARA OLDER AND JUST. ARE S. TO ALSO CALFRESH. OUR THIRD PRO COMPOSED IS PERHAPS. IS THE LAW IN THE COME. IT IS A NEW WALDRON. IN BRAZIL PASS. THAT HAS NOT TO AREA- TO INVESTMENT PROPOSED. A HUNDRED AND SIX MY OVER THREE. A HUNDRED FOR OUR NETWORK WITH TEMPER OF FOR OTHER NEEDS CAPACITY. ADMINISTRATION IN. I'M GOING TO SECOND JUST LISTA NINE OUT PURPOSES BIG THEY ARE ALL IMPORTANT. PARTS OF HER AND COMMUNITY. UNDER TRISH OUR MEALS PRO THAT. AND CAN CENTERS WERE ARE SLOWLY REOPENED. LEGAL SERVICES WHICH HELPS WITH. FROM PREVENTING EVICTION. TO OFFER ON IN ADMITTED AGAINST THEM IN EVERYTHING ELSE IN BETWEEN. FALTERED AND OUT OF. FALLS OR OF INTO BECAUSE OF DEATH FOR OLDER. DIGITAL CONNECTION ARE SO MUCH OF TO CLOSE DIGITAL DIVIDE. MORE THAN TWO OLDER AND- ARE UNDER CONNECTED AROUND CAN IN THE THAT CAN FOR. AND- AND SO. CONNECT SENIOR UP. MAY SENIOR BOTH NEED TO WORKING STORE. I TO FORTY AGING. AGING RE CONNECTS ARE AS WE KNOW THEM NUMBER ON. SYSTEM THE PUBLIC CAN FOR IN FOR ABOUT JUST. BEHAVIORAL FRIENDSHIP LINE WHICH CAN TO RECEIVE HER OF TODAY. AFTER OLDER ADULTS I FEEL A LITTLE LONG LOOKING FOR CHAT I A FRIENDLY PERSON TO TALK WITH THEM. FAMILY CARE SUPPORT THEM CARE GIVER HAVE. BORN IN BURDEN THE PAST YEAR KAREN LOVED ONES AT HOME AND LOOK TO INCREASE THE SUPPORT. IN A NEW STATE ELDER ABUSE. K. WHICH- WAS CALLED FOR IN ABOUT PLAN AGING TO. A THE- AND STATE ALL THAT WE'RE DOING. ON ABUSE NEGLECT EXPLAINED AND FRAUD. INFORMATION AND SERVICES. FIVE OKAY THE GENERAL PROCEDURE THE QUESTION WHICH IS ABOUT THAT PACKAGE OF OLDER ADULTS RECOVERY RESILIENCY AND ASKING HOW DOES NOT ADDRESS THE NEED AND WHAT NEEDS MIGHT REMAIN I THOUGHT I JUST GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF WHERE CURRENT SERVICES OR WHAT THE OPPOSE FUNDING WOULD DO AND WHAT GAPS MIGHT REMAIN BASED ON OUTCOME DATA IN THE DATA WE HAVE. PARTICULARLY FROM THE NEW DATA DASHBOARD FOR AGING FOR THE MASTER PLAN SO OLDER ADULT MALES. HOELTZEL WOULD PROVIDE ONE TIME FUND OF UP TWENTY POINT SEVEN MILLION OVER THREE YEARS. ON TOP OF THE REMOVAL OF SUSPENSIONS ON ONGOING SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE. WE'RE COMING OFF OF AN AIRCRAFT STILL IN A RECORD SETTING. PACE OF OUR NETWORK SERVING MEALS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION MEALS WERE SERVED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND ALL THROUGH LAST WEEK WE HAD ELEVEN MILLION MEALS COMING THROUGH OUR NETWORK IN THIS YEAR. OF THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDS DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S ALLOCATED COULD- REACH AS MANY AS ONE POINT NINE MILLION ADDITIONAL MEALS. IN PART WHY I'M HEDGING ON THAT EXACT NUMBER IS SOME MAY BE USED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE NETWORK NEEDS TO ADDRESS- FREEZERS AND COOLERS AND OTHER CAPACITY NEEDS OF TO MEET THESE RECORD SETTING NUMBERS. AND ALSO THE SYSTEM IS ALWAYS INFORMED BY THE MIX OF HOME AND PONDERED AT HOME IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS AND THAT'S IN FLUX WE EXPECT SOME COMMUNITY SETTINGS TO AND WE KNOW FROM OUR SURVEYS OF OUR NETWORK THIS SUMMER COMING BACK IN PERSON. BUT THAT'S THAT'S IN FLUX STILL AS MANY AND MOST IN FACT REMAIN HOME BASED. ALSO THERE'S- AND AGAIN SO WHAT'S THE NEED WE LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS SECURITY RATES OLDER ADULTS. IN CALIFORNIA 30% FOOD AND SECURITY RIGHT. THAT'S EIGHT HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS REPORT FOOD SECURITY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND EVEN HIGHER RATES AND BLACK ELDERS A NATIVE AMERICAN ELDERS. SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO EVEN WITH THAT COMBINATION OF HOME MEALS AND CALFRESH OUTREACH AND SO MUCH MORE TO REDUCE FOOD INSECURITY. IN OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. TWO OTHER QUICK EXAMPLES- THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE WITH FEDERAL FUNDS WE WERE ABLE TO BEGIN THIS INITIATIVE. ARE WE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE- THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE DISTRIBUTE FOUR THOUSAND DEVICES TO OLDER ADULTS WITH TWO YEARS OF BROADBAND IN TECH SUPPORT. WE ALSO HAD EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED DONATED GOOGLE SMART SPEAKERS THAT WE DISTRIBUTED WITH THIS ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE. TO DISTRIBUTE TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL DEVICES AGAIN WITHOUT. TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BROADBAND WRAPPED IN A BUT WE ALSO WANT TO. JUST MILLION DOLLAR INITIATIVE UNDER CLASSES. BUT ONLINE AND FOR TO HELP PEOPLE OUT USE THAT. NO WAY IS MEETING TO THEM. AND WE KNOW AGAIN THE DIGITAL BY- IS THE STRONGEST FOR OLDEST DAUGHTERS THE WIDEST FOR OLDER ADULTS. OUR NETWORK REPORTED THAT THE CIRCUIT DE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITY CENTERS WHO ARE NOT CONNECTED TO WOULD LIKE TO BE CONNECTED. AND RESEARCH ALL THE UC SYSTEM SHOWS MORE THAN TWO MILLION- OF THE EIGHT MILLION OLDER ADULTS ARE UNDER EVER AND CONNECTED. AND LASTLY JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON FALLS PREVENTION. YEAH THERE'S A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ON GOING. THAT IS ALLOWING US TO SERVE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH VERY ESSENTIAL HOME MODIFICATIONS GRAB BARS RAMPS ETCETERA TO PREVENT THOSE FALLS THAT CAN BE TO DEATH OR A SERIOUS DECLINE OR MOVE TO MORE INTENSIVE CARE. THE NEW FUNDING WOULD GET US TO ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. ARE WHICH IS TERRIFIC- BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THAT. FALLS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF INJURY RELATED DEATH. ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA DIE FROM FALLS- AND- WE WANT TO OBVIOUSLY GET TO THOSE WHO AWESOME SERIOUS INJURIES AS WELL SO MORE TO BE DONE TO REDUCE SERVICE. THOSE ARE JUST THREE EXAMPLES I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS OR ANYTHING ELSE. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WITHOUT A WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS. TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. C. NONE- FOR I'D LIKE TO SAY HOUSE STAGGERING IT WAS TO HEAR. THE FOOD AND SECURITY IN OUR OLDER ADULTS WITH EIGHT HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND. OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH THIS AND SECURITY AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE TO THANK YOUR ENTIRE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE EFFORT. THAT YOU'VE DONE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC TO HELP TO DELIVER. HOT MEALS TO. THOSE WHO HAVE NEEDS THAT HAVE NOT GONE UNNOTICED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL THAT APPRECIATION. IT WAS A HUGE LEFT FOR YOUR DEPARTMENTS TO UNDERTAKE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU. UNDERSTAND THAT- WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL YOUR EFFORTS DIRECTOR- DID WANTS TO GO INTO YOUR MASTER PLAN OF AGING AND- STATISTICALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ETFS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MASTER PLAN. ON AGING WAS TO LOWER THE AGE OF- APS FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY. IN AN EFFORT FOR US TO. BETTER ADDRESS THE ABUSE NEGLECT AND FRAUD THAT ARE OLDER ADULTS ARE GOING THROUGH SO I'M- WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT WHY- WITHIN THIS BUDGET WE DID NOT DECREASE THE AGE OF APS FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY. FOUR FOLLOW SPECIFIC A APS QUESTIONS I WOULD DEFER TO DIRECTOR JOHNSON DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WENT THAT HOUSES A PS BUT I CAN'T OF FROM THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME IN FROM STAKEHOLDERS- DURING THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING PROCESS AND THAT IT IS SOMETHING WE ANTICIPATE THE NEW ELDER JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL. ON TAKING INTO RUBIO. I'M I'M HAPPY TO ECHO THE QUESTION TO HER BUT- I THINK SINCE IT STARTED WITH THE MASTER PLAN OF AGING I'M JUST. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT- IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BY NOW I HAVE AN INTEREST IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE EXTEND THESE SERVICES AND AGAIN GET. UPSTREAM OF MANY PROBLEMS THAT WILL OCCUR LATER ON IN LIFE ANYWAY SO. REALLY BELIEVE IT'S ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US AS A STATE TO MOVE THAT AGE DOWN TO SIXTEEN AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THAT IN IN LIGHT OF THE HOUR THAT IT IS I WILL HOLD THIS PANEL I WILL THANK THIS PANEL FOR ITS PRESENTATION. AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO PANEL FOR. WHICH IS ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL. FIRST WE WILL HAVE DAVID SCRIBNER WHO IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL FOR. THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CAN WE PLEASE BEGAN WITH DIRECTOR SCRIBNER. THANK YOU MISTER STARING FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS A TRAILER BILL BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE OF THE TOP FOR SOUNDING LIKE A BILLY GOAT ROUGH BUT MY ALLERGIES ARE KICKING UP AND EVERY TIME THE WIND BLOWS LIKE THROW JUST GETS DESTROYED SO I WILL MAKE IT THROUGH- BUT IT IT. I DO SOUND LIKE I AM DISEASE BUT IT'S JUST ALLERGIES. THE FIRST DVL CENTERS ON LOW INCOME. HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIHEAP WHICH HELPS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS AND ALSO PROVIDES WEATHER'S ATION SERVICES. YES HE IS SEEKING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EFFECTUATE THE BETTER UTILIZATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIKE HE FUNDING APPROPRIATED UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SIGNS WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS ENERGY UTILITY A RESURGENCE ACCRUED BY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION IN PARKS SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT HE FUNDING. AND THAT'S FUNNY AUGMENT CSP'S REGULAR LIFE ANNUAL FUNDING IT IS INTENDED TO BE ADMINISTERED LIKE LIKE HE- JUST ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS TO AID THOSE IN NEED. AS A RESULT OF THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I COULD NOT MAKE IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC OF LEAD TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACCRUING HISTORIC LEVELS OF ENERGY THAT. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DATA THROUGH MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS R. B. HOLT BEHIND ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS. WITH A TOTAL RICH OF OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION. AND WITH MANY POTENTIALLY AT RISK OF LOSING ENERGY UTILITY SYSTEM SERVICES DUE TO NON PAYMENT. THE PROPOSAL I HE TPL WILL ALLOW CST TO SUSPEND SPECIFIED CODE SECTIONS IN ORDER TO DEVOTE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT HEAT FUNDING APPROPRIATED UNDER OUR- I FINANCIAL SYSTEMS PAYMENTS FOR HOME ENERGY. AND HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS MANAGE THE REPAYMENT OF HISTORICALLY HIGH ENERGY BILL REVISIONS. UNDER THE GOVERNMENT COAT. CST IS REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE SPECIFIED PERCENTAGES OF LIFE FUNDING TOWARDS VARIOUS PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. INCLUDING UP 225% FOR WEATHER IS ASIAN SERVICE. THE PROPOSED TBL AGAINST CSKA THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH PERCENTAGES THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO UTILITY ASSISTANCE AND WEATHERIZATION. TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THIS TBL MIRRORS A SIMILAR WAIVER GRANTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND DASH SEVENTY FIVE DASH TWENTY. I TO THE FORTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION IN SUPPLEMENTAL WHY HE FUNDING CST RECEIVED UNDER THE CARE THAT. THE NEXT TV DON'T DEALS WITH A LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL AMENDMENTS GIVE SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTER THE NEWLY CREATED FEDERAL LOW INCOME WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM. THIS NEW PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE ONE TIME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES. THAT PAY A HIGH PROPORTION OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES. NATIONWIDE CONGRESS APPROPRIATED A TOTAL OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR FEDERAL WATER SYSTEM FROM THE FEDERAL WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM. BUT WHILE NO OFFICIAL GRANT FIGURES HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. CST ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA PREPARATION TO BE IN THE RANGE OF EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION. ACCORDINGLY FINANCES PUT PLACE HOLDER IN THE BUDGET FOR NINETY MILLION. US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS A VICE STATES THAT THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER SYSTEMS PROGRAM WILL CLOSELY FOLLOW STATUTORY AND REGULATORY GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED FOR LIGHT. IN RESPONSE GOVERNOR% SOME IDENTIFIED CST IS THE DESIGNATED AGENCY TO ADMINISTER THE LOW INCOME HOME WATER HOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FINAL PROGRAM DESIGNER REQUIREMENTS HAVE YET TO BE RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT YES HE IS INFORMED IT WILL BE BASED IN LARGE PART ONLINE HE- AS WELL TIMELINE FOR EXPENDITURES HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. CST IS AWARE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DIRECTS ONE BILLION TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS WATER REGIONS WHICH WILL IMPACT THOSE OR YOU'RE JUST ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE THE WHITEWATER. WELL I WANT AND THE STATE WATER SO THE SYSTEM SHARE THE COMMON OBJECTIVE OF EXTENDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOWER THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. BOTH PROGRAMS WILL ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. WHAT C. S. B. WAS DESIGNATED AS THE STATE AGENCY TO ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL WATER PROGRAM CST THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE CQC. BEGAN TO COORDINATE AND DEVELOP A PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. HIS INITIAL MEETINGS TOOK PLACE PRIOR TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SIGNALING ITS INTENT TO MODELADO UP CLOSE WE WOULD LIKE. FROM SUCH WHAT WAS NEED WILL NEED TO BE ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN A ONE CUSTOMER ONE APPLICATION APPROACH SIMILAR TO LIFE HE- OUREARLY DISCUSSIONS SURROUNDING A STATE WATER PROGRAM DESIGNED SENATE ON A MORE MACRO LEVEL RESPONSE BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH WATER UTILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN CSU WILL CONTINUE RECORDING WHY WHAT DEVELOPMENT WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE CQC TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. EVEN PROGRAM LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN UTILIZING THE LIE HE FRAMEWORK FOR SERVICE DELIVERY. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE ALSO INCLUDES A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR CSK TO ADMINISTER THE NEWLY CREATED CALIFORNIA RESEARCH PAYMENT PROGRAM. A PROPOSED ONE BILLION FROM THE STATE'S ART ALLOCATION WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA REPAIR PROGRAM OR CAP. OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PREVENT ENERGY UTILITY DISCONNECTIONS APPEARANCES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION I OWE YOU LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS ONLY ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED. THESE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE POTENTIALLY AT RISK OF LOSING ENERGY UTILITY SERVICES WHEN I OWE YOU MORE TOWARDS PREVENTING DISCONNECTION FOR NON PAYMENT ARE LIFTED OR RESCINDED. CST SERVERS SKINNER CST PRESUMES SIMILAR TRENDS WITH ACCUMULATED ENERGY UTILITY DEBT AND PAYMENT DELINQUENCY EXIST WITHIN NOT REGULATED UTILITY COMPANY SERVICE AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BASED ON THIS ASSUMPTION. ESTIMATES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ENERGY UTILITY CUSTOMERS IN ARREARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WHAT IS BEEN REFLECTED IN CPC SPECIFIC REPORTING. CAP WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY CST A LEVERAGE THE EXISTING LINE MECHANISMS FOR PROVIDING FINANCIAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE. CAP IS DESIGNED TO MOBILIZE A STRONGER STATE RESPONSE THE STATE ENERGY BURST THE TO THE ENERGY UTILITY DEBT LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE CARRYING. I WILL EXPEDITE THE DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THESE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH YOU ENERGY UNTIL THESE TO IDENTIFY AND CREDIT ACCOUNTS OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS PRIORITIZED FOR KAPPA SYSTEMS. BY USING THIS METHOD WOULD. CAP BENEFITS CAN BE DELIVERED TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE LIKE WHAT LONG TERM CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS VIA SINGLE PAYMENT TRANSACTION. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE MAJORITY OF WELCOME CUSTOMER BENEFICIARIES WILL NOT NEED TO APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE. FOR CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE UTILITIES ELECTED NOT TO ADMINISTER TACKLE SYSTEMS DIRECTLY. CSP PLANTS ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SIMILAR TO WHY HE- GOAL THE PROGRAM IS THE EIGHT THE MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FACING ORIGINS AND HOW QUICKLY THIS FINANCIAL SYSTEM REACHES. OF MOBILE HELP CALIFORNIANS WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFUL THE STATE AND ENERGY UTILITIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO EXPEDITE THE DELIVERY OF BENEFITS. CST IS CONFIDENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK DELIVER THIS RELIEF OFFICIALLY AND EFFECTIVELY. TO HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON IN THEIR HOMES COOL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE. APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION. WILL BE DEVOTED TO LOCAL SYSTEMS WITH SIX POINT FIVE MILLION RETAINED BY CSP FOR STATE OPERATIONS. AND THERE'S A NEW THERE'S AN AD TO THE AGENDA. I WAS ASKED TO COVER. OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. THE MAY REALIZE PROPOSED ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT OVER THREE YEARS TO HELP MEET THE STATE'S PRIORITY CLIMATE GOALS. FUND PROJECTS THAT INCREASE RESILIENCE AND ADDRESS CLIMATE RISKS WITHIN THE STATE SUCH AS EXTREME HEAT AND SEA LEVEL RISE. BUT IT WOULD BE FOR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS SUPPORTED IN THE MINISTERED BY VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES INCLUDING GST. THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION FOR THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM MULTI FAMILY COMPONENT. ADMINISTERED BY C. THE STATE. THE LIGHTWEIGHT MULTI FAMILY COMPONENT HELPS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY PROVIDING INVESTMENTS AND SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES. AND ROOFTOP SOLAR PEAVEY SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION. THESE INVESTMENTS REDUCE ENERGY COSTS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS RESIDING IN MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES WHILE ALSO HELPING TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY LOWERING OPERATING COSTS. FUNDING WILL BE USED TO CONTINUE PROGRAM OFFERINGS AND SERVICES WILL SUPPORT ADDING HIGHER INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE REPLACEMENT OF HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS WITH LOW GLOBAL WARMING REFRIGERANTS IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF HIGH GLOBAL WARMING REFRESHMENTS THAT ARE THOUSANDS OF TIMES. MORE POTENT PER POUND THAN CARBON DIOXIDE. AN INMATE MY BROTHER DIDN'T GIVE UP. THANK YOU DIRECTOR MMHM NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. L. THANK YOU TERRY MILLA AND LET'S START WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AS DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT A NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS IS STILL FORTHCOMING- IN PARTICULAR AS OF THIS MORNING THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THE NEWLY PROPOSED- ONE BILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIA. A RIDGE ASSISTANT PAID PAYMENT PROGRAM IS NOT YET AVAILABLE BUT ONCE THAT IS WE WILL BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP WITH COMMITTEE STAFF REGARDING ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SHORT AND IT WAS- THE CHAIRS OVERSIGHT NOT TO INCLUDE JACQUI BORA SEAL IT WITH THE L. A. L. ON THE LAST PANEL. SO I'D LIKE TO BRING IN JACQUI TO COMMENT ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING IF WE CAN ON PANEL THREE NOW. SURE JANUARY CHAU- AGAIN PER YOUR DIRECTION FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I'LL START WITH WHICH PROPOSALS DO GENERALLY ALIGN WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES BASED OFF OF WHAT WE KNOW I THINK ONE THE PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO CONNECT EXERCISES P. RECIPIENTS TO CALFRESH BUILT UPON LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO EXTEND CALFRESH TO S. SCIENCES PETE I THINK THE OTHER ONE WITH PERHAPS THERE IS. A MORE CLEAR CONNECTION- IT IS D. R. LARGER MASTER PLAN FOR AGING PROPOSAL AND THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR WITH THE NUTRITION AUGMENTATION- HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PURSUING AND REDUCING AND ELIMINATING SENIOR HUNGER- AND AGAIN THE PROPOSED SUSPENSION ENDS- OF BINDING ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH SENIOR NUTRITION AND ADRC OUR ACTIONS THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN DOING EMPIRE HEARINGS I'M WITH THE SENIOR NUTRITION ONE I WOULD JUST ECHO THE SENTIMENT WITHIN. THE AGENDAS QUESTION IN THAT THINKING AHEAD AND HAVING THE NECESSARY DATA TO KNOW WHERE SENIOR HUNGER TODAY OR WHERE WILL IT BE POST COLD VICT- WILL BE CRITICAL TO FOR THEM THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE- THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH ITS OWN GOAL WHEN IT COMES TO THE ELIMINATION REDUCTION OF SENIOR HUNGER IN THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BUT ALSO WITH THAT WE WILL RETURN TO PANEL FOR DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT WE WILL BEGIN. OUR QUESTIONS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. FOR YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I THINK I HEARD. THAT THE WATER SITUATION WAS GONNA BE IN A BILLION. AND I'M JUST ASKING CST USED. THE WATER BOND THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE WAS FIVE POINT SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS WAS POSED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER BILLION IS THERE ANY KIND OF FACTOR FIG FIGURE THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE TO GIVE PEOPLE RELIABLE CLEAN WATER SOURCES- I MEAN WHAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING IT IN THE WATER BOND AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN- IS. THIS GOING TO DO IT OR DO WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE FOR MORE. AND WHY DID WE GO FOR MORE NOW WHEN WE AGAIN LOOK INTO. A BUDGET SURPLUS WHERE THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT REALLY DOES BRING BACK A VALUE. I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS FOR- ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER FEAR. PROPEL I'M SORRY I. WE AT THAT CST DON'T MINISTER OF A WATER PROGRAM AND WE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER T THE STATE WATER BOARD ON ON THE NUMBERS AND FUNDING NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN. NOT ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER I BELIEVE HE WAS REFERENCING ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE THE FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM GRANT THAT IS UNDER CST- BUT I WILL ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER TO CLARIFY. SO IN A LOT OF INSTANCES WHEN WE'VE HAD THE OF. THE ISSUES OF WATER WE'VE WE'VE ADDRESSED IN A WATER BOND WE'VE ADDRESSED IN DIFFERENT RESOURCES. I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THAT WE CONTINUE TO CHIP AT THIS. ADDITIONAL HELP. AND I'M WONDERING IS THERE ANTICIPATED IS THIS. CONSIDERED TO BE A FIX- OR IS THERE AN NECESSITY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT MORE RESOURCES TO HELP MORE PEOPLE I MEAN- HEY AGAIN IN THESE ANTICIPATED BUDGET SURPLUS. SHOULD WE BE ADDRESSING THIS IS A ONE TIME LET'S FIX THIS GOING FORWARD. WELL THE CST IS ONLY A MINISTER IN A VERY SMALL WATER PROGRAM WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND AGAIN THAT IS GOING TO BE IN THE RANGE OF EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION WE DO KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DO WITH YOUR RELIGIOUS BUT- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS TO WHETHER. THIS IS ENOUGH FOR IF THERE'S GONNA BE A NEED FOR MORE I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE WATER BOARD THAT CST DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA OR STATISTICAL EVIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ANSWERS HERE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR FOR. MY QUESTIONS I'M GONNA FOCUS ON ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY SIX REGARDING THE ENERGY A RE RIDGES THE BILLION DOLLARS THE STATE IS. PROPOSING AND I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. COMMENT OF ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BEING BOTH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY. COMPETENT AND OUR OUTREACH AND SO WANTED TO ASK YOU ACTING DIRECTOR HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING OUR MONO LINGUAL COMMUNITIES OR- SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NOT BE. ABLE TO TRADITIONALLY ACCESS THIS PROGRAM BUT THAT COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THAT. HOW ARE WE INTENTIONALLY DOING OUTREACH TO THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WELL THE INITIAL PROGRAM DESIGN IS AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL AND THAT I THINK THAT THE PLAN WOULD BE TO GET A MAJORITY OF THE LOW INCOME AND THOSE GLOBAL POPULATIONS. I'VE DEALT WITH DIRECTLY FROM THE UTILITY ITSELF AND THEN THE OUTRAGE WOULD BE. NONEXISTENT IT AND SEXUALLY THAT THEY THEY START CUSTOMERS WOULD THEN BE TAGGED AND IDENTIFIED IN AN APPLICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD THEN JUST ISSUE ONE BIG CHECK AND THEY WOULD BE THEN APPLIED TO- THE ORIGINAL BALANCE IS THAT THESE CUSTOMERS HAVE. NOW IN THE AREAS OF WHERE UTILITY MAY NOT BE PARTICIPATING WITH CAP DIRECTLY WITH CSP. WHAT WE WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD DONE BEFORE- WE WOULD HAVE WE RELY ON OUR- NETWORK OF CEOS A LOCAL PROVIDERS TO DO THAT OUTRAGE AS NECESSARY AND HOW THEY BELIEVE IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DEAL WITH IT FOR THE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR. DECADES UNDER THE LIKELY PROGRAM SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD FIND ANY GAPS IN SERVICE- AND YOU BELIEVE IN AND ACTUALLY HAVE THE MICRO TO MACRO LEVEL WILL BE. ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES MUCH QUICKER THAN WE COULD IF IT WERE DONE ON A. ONE APPLICATION ONE CUSTOMER APPROACH- I'M ENCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING REGARDING- HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED I HAVE CONCERNS THAT- ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MIGHT NOT. HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HAVING- IN INTENTIONALITY IN ADDRESSING THIS IN ADVANCE. OF THE APPLICATIONS AND IF THAT REQUIRES US AS A STATE TO LOOK TOWARDS SUPPORTING THOSE CBO'S ARE NONPROFITS WHO ARE. DOING THAT OUTREACH I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS REACHING THOSE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. WHO COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM- AND WITH THAT I WILL AGAIN THANK VERY MUCH THIS PANEL AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL. WHICH IS ON THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY MAY REVISE UPDATES WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL MARKHAM YOU CHECK WITH THE DEPUTY SECRETARY. OF PROGRAM AND FISCAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CAN WE PLEASE BEGIN WITH MR MAJOR. GOOD AFTERNOON- DR. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY- THERE TO PARTICULAR ITEMSTHAT I'D LIKE TO SPEND A LOT- SOMETIME ON AND THEN CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE RELATED TO THIS ITEM SO FIRST STARTING WITH THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSAL THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BE AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. TO EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE IN LANGUAGE- DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE ACROSS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS I WITHIN OUR AGENCY- AND THIS REALLY IS A- IS AN EFFORT OF BOTH- OUR AGENCY AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS. IN ORDER FOR US TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE REACHING FOLKS IN LANGUAGE OUT WHILE ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE BE FIVE PER CAPABILITY. I HAD TO DO A SL AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE. INTERPRETATION AS PART OF- VIDEOS OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE PUT OUT AT AT AT THE AT THE AGENCY AND SO THIS PROPOSAL REALLY COMPLEMENTS AND AT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHICH INCLUDES SOME RESOURCES THE AGENCY TO BEGIN TO BUILD OUT A FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT LANGUAGE ACCESS LOOKS LIKE ACROSS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND THE INTENT HERE REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL DEPARTMENTS HAVE A BASELINE THIS DOES NOT NEGATE OR CHANGE THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT LANGUAGE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS OR IN STATUTE FOR A NUMBER OF OUR DEPARTMENTS BUT THEY'RE EVERY SERIES OF DEPARTMENTS. THAT DON'T HAVE REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BASICALLY CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY. ACROSS THE AGENCY. MAJORITY OF DOLLAR WILL BE ON. ARE REALLY UP OUR CONTRACT KEEP. TO TRANSLATE DOCUMENTS THAT WE PUT OUT TO CONSUMERS AND INDIVIDUALS IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REALLY LOOKING AT COORDINATING AMONGST BOTH ARE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER FOR US TO GET ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND LEVERAGE OUR PURCHASING POWER ACROSS THE STATE. OR ACROSS OUR AGENCY IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DELIVER ON LANGUAGE ACCESS SO. THAT IS THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSAL THE SECOND PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU AS PART OF THAT MAY REVISION IS A RESOURCES AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR AROUND WHAT H. I. E. IS I WILL JUST SAY THAT- OUR VISION HERE REALLY IS FOR US TO TAKE A BOLDER LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF. NOT ONLY HOW ARE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY LOOK AT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BUT ALSO HOW THE INDUSTRY LEVERAGES HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE OR HOW IT USES. AT THE DATA THAT IT COLLECTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND THE DELIVERY OF. SERVICE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND SO OUR TENSION HERE REALLY IS TWO FOLD ONE IS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME STANDARDS OF HOW THIS INFORMATION IS EXCHANGED AND TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN A MORE ROBUST WAY AROUND. HOW WE DO THIS COLLECTIVELY I WILL JUST SAY THAT THE TRADITIONALLY THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED AT A PROVIDER'S OFFICE BUT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE BOTH FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE REASON I SAY THIS. IS THAT SOME OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS ACCESS TO HOUSING TRANSPORTATION FOOD. ETCETERA ARE PARAMOUNT IN US HAVING THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS HOW. COMES OR IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN MANY INSTANCES. AND REALLY WORK WITH- THE INDUS TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE THINK. ABOUT THE SOCIAL SERVICES DATA AND HOW THAT COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE CLINICAL DATA- THAT IS- REALLY COLLECTED AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO WRAP OURSELVES AROUND MORE REALISTICALLY AROUND THE INDIVIDUALS WERE TRYING TO SERVE IN ORDER TO. IMPROVE OUTCOMES SO BOTTOM LINE THIS PROPOSAL IN PARTICULAR MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO READ SOME LEADERSHIP IN ORDER FOR US TO BOTH CREATE STANDARDS AND CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION EXCHANGE FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PERSPECTIVE LOOKS LIKE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DR RANDALL I'LL PAUSE THERE AND- LOOK TO ENGAGE YOU IN YOUR- AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ON THE COMMITTEE WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR ME. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. L. I THANK YOU MR CHER CINEMATIC L. A. IN REGARDS TO THE AGENCY'S PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY MILLION FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS- THIS PROPOSAL DOES APPEAR TO ALIGN WITH LEGISLATIVE- THAT PRIORITIES THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN AS MR MNUCHIN NOTED THE VARIOUS- PROVISIONS IN THE STATUTE REGARDING REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THRESHOLD LANGUAGES- IT WAS IT WAS ALSO NOTED THE PROPOSAL BUILDS ON- AT. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IN JANUARY- THAT HAD APPROVED- PROPOSAL TO. CREATE A LANGUAGE ACCESS POLICY FRAMEWORK- WE WOULD NOTE THAT- ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSAL TO ACTUALLY START PROVIDING LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICES WITH THE TWENTY MILLION. LIKELY MAKES. SENSE TO SOME TO SOME TO. THE PROPOSAL AND- WAS TO AS- THE- FOR THE STAY WOULD HAVE- WHEN ACCESS. WE'RE WONDERING IF SOME OF DOLLARS FOR THIS THAT. MIGHT BE. BEFORE THE FOR MARKET IS. A THE SAME TIME LIKE I SAID IT'S THERE'S PROBABLY SOME OBVIOUS AREAS WHERE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS NEEDED WE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO REALLY ASSESS WHETHER TWENTY MILLION IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT SEEN- DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL JUST YET- IN REGARDS TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE LEADERSHIP THIS IS ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT. YET AND SO AS MORE DETAILS BECOME AVAILABLE WE'RE CERTAINLY I'M HAPPY CHIU TO WEIGH. IN ON THOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WITH A I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WHAT. YES AND MY- MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT BEING IN THE ROOM WHEN- MARCO WAS- SPEAKING ORIGINALLY AND- WITH REGARDS TO- THE H. I. E. PROPOSAL IS THAT. THAT REALLY MEANT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE MEDICARE OUT. PORTION OF THE STATE POPULATION OR- HELP ME HELP ME GET MY ARMS AROUND THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD. HI DOCTOR WHAT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ABSOLUTELY NOT ADD THIS TO THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THAT'S AT THE AGENCY IS REALLY INTENDED TO DO A FEW THINGS ONE. IT'S INTENDED TO BRING TOGETHER AN ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE- AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO HELP GUIDE OUR WORK AROUND INFORMATION EXCHANGE- AND I THINK I SEE THIS MORE ABOUT BOTH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INFORMATION. AND HOW THAT INFORMATION IS EXCHANGED AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL OR AT THE HEALTH SYSTEM LEVEL AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE REALLY IS TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE- CREATES SOME STANDARDS. IN IN THE WAVE THIS INFORMATION% EXPECTS CHANGED OUR TEMPLATE SILICATES FURTHER EXCHANGE OF THIS INFORMATION MORE BROADLY IN AS A PROVIDER YOURSELF AND BOTH YOU AND DR ARAMBULA. I THINK REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PROVIDER HAS ALL OF THE INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO THE INDIVIDUAL SO THAT WE CAN FURTHER. IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND FOR ME IT'S A IT'S IMPERATIVE OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE DATA THAT YOU COLLECT AN EMR OR EHR BUT IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE SOCIAL. DATA WHETHER OR NOT AND SOMEONE'S GETTING ACCESS TO CAO WORKS OR CALFRESH AWAKE AND HOW THAT ALL UNDER LINES ARE UNDER CONSTABULARIES. FOR A FOR YOUTUBE TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES SO THE BOTTOM LINE THAT THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THAT'S AT THE AGENCY LEVEL IS REALLY SPECIFIC TO BUILDING SOME LEADERSHIP IN ORDER FOR US TO. AB CREEK BEGIN TO CREATE STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR US TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF H. I EAT AND I WOULD EXPAND HIV TO NOT JUST INCLUDE HEALTH. AND HUMAN SERVICES DATA AS WELL. OKAY I DO I GUESS I MY COM WOULD JUST BE THAN I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF STUDY AROUND THIS OVER THE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS. GROUPS OF STAKEHOLDERS BABY NOT ORGANIZED TOGETHER THAT WAY- TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND- THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON HEALTH INFORMATION- YOU KNOW- ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE. SO I GUESS. I GUESS WHAT DO YOU EXPECTING THE OUTCOME TO BE BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE. WE ARE SET WE ALSO HAVE NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT. CERTAIN ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGES AND THINGS WERE HOSPITAL SO- IN IN THE LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE ACCESS TO SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN HUGELY VALUABLE TO US. WHICH SIMPLY WASN'T THERE- YEAH HOW LONG DO YOU SEE THIS PROCESS GOING I MEAN. IT JUST FEELS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE KIND OF SLOW WALKING SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULD GET DONE SOONER. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOUR DOCTOR WELL I DON'T THINK THE INTENTION IS TO STUDY ANYTHING BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE STUDIED IT QUITE WELL I THINK THE INTENTION HERE IS TO. BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE NATIONAL STANDARDS THE ONC STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT HOW DO WE ADD TO THOSE OR BUILD OFF OF THOSE SO THAT WE HAVE SOME LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AROUND HOW WE ACCELERATE THE EXCHANGE OF DATA WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THEN REALLY BEING ABLE TO BUILD. UP A YOU KNOW AN ADVISORY BODY TO HELP GUIDE THE STATE BOTH IN THE SHARING OF OUR OWN DATA AMONGST OUR OWN DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO WHAT STANDARDS INDUSTRY CAN USE IN ORDER TO FURTHER ACCELERATE THE USE OF THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT-ON. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE PANDEMIC REALLY EACH SHIP ON A LIGHT ON THE FACT THAT THIS DATA SOMETIMES ISN'T SHARED BUT THE VALUE IN SHARING IT OR HAVING IT SHARED IN A IN A- IN A IN IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS PRIVACY. AND LOOKS AT KIND OF THE POPULATION MORE BROADLY IS PARAMOUNT TO US BEING ABLE TO DO THAT SO OUR GOAL HERE REALLY IS TAKE CELEBRATE THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THIS VISION OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SO JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO IS THIS- IS THIS MEANT TO BE MORE INTROSPECTIVE OF STATE GOVERNMENT OR ARE YOU LOOKING AT A STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT INVOLVES A BROADER A BROADER- I NEED. IT I GUESS IN MY MIND THESE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T WORK UNLESS EVERYBODY'S IN AND SO- SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT SOMETHING THIS IS GOING TO HELP WITH OUR STATE DATA THAT'S NOT THAT DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY A THIRD OF THE POPULATION. AND SAID YEAH AND IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE STATE IT'S FULLY ENCOMPASSING SO I THINK WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER H. I. EASE H. I. OWES HEALTH SYSTEMS PROVIDERS AT SENTARA LOOKING AT HOW WE MAKE THIS AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO JUST FOCUS ON STATE. AT THE EXCHANGE OF STATE DATA. OKAY THE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE CHAIR FOR A FINAL COMMENT IF I CAN FOR HHS I WILL BRING BACK CST FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION IF ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER STILL AVAILABLE THE FIRST MARCO SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE SILOS BETWEEN HHS AND SOCIAL SERVICES. EARLIER WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING WITH SOCIAL SERVICES WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THE INTENSE AND EXCUSE ME THE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WITHIN CAL WORKS WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT CAL AIM IN THE EFFORTS BEHIND THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT THAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND SIMILARITIES WITH THE PROGRAM IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND ADVANTAGES FOR US TO GETTING UPSTREAM AND- INCREASING THOSE SERVICES BEFORE WE GOT TO ECM WAS HOPING TO YOU COULD JUST PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS OUR CONFIDENCE IN THAT SPACE. SURE DOCTOR ARAMBULA FIRST THANKS- FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S PARAMOUNT TO S. AT THE AGENCY IN THIS IS REALLY LED BY DR GALLEON AND ARE UNDER SECRETARY MACHON BAIS IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE WHOLE PERSON AND WE TALK ABOUT A WHOLE PERSON FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH AND MEDICAID- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT A WHOLE PERSON WITH REGARDS TO- THE SERVICES THAT WE DELIVER ON THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CITING SO WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. REALLY ENGAGING- AN ARRAY OF OUR DEPARTMENTS TO SAY HOW ARE WE WRAPPING OURSELVES MORE REALISTICALLY AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE ACCESSING MULTIPLE PROGRAMS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY AND MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE SILENT STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT AND NOT BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE AND SO OUR INTENT AND OUR GOAL HERE. IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE HOLISTICALLY WRAP. OURSELVES AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE PERSON AND HAVING THEM COME THROUGH ONE DOOR ANYTHING DOCTOR ADD TO DIRECTOR CAME. WAIT TIMES TALKED ABOUT THIS FROM AN AGING PERSPECTIVE BUT IT'S NOT IMPERATIVE ON AGING I WAS HEARING YOUR CONVERSATION AROUND. THE DD SYSTEM AND AN EARLIER AROUND THE CONVERSATION AROUND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS MORE ABOUT. HOW DO WE AS AN AGENCY AND HOW DO WE AS AN AGENCY THAT ENGAGE WITH OTHER AGENCIES WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT TO SAY WE ARE SERVING SIMILAR POPULATIONS AND HOW DO WE WRAP OURSELVES AROUND WITH REGARDS TO CALAMP. OUR INTENT IN THE SECRETARY'S VISION AND DIRECTOR LIFEFORMS VISION HERE REALLY IS ABOUT HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MEDICAID SYSTEM- THAT REALLY LOOKS AT SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND WORKING MORE UPSTREAM. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND SO PART OF THIS IT PROPOSAL WOULD WITH REGARDS TO CALLIN IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND MAKE A MEDICAID AND EQUALIZER AND YOU KNOW NOT NOT EQUITY TOOL IN MANY WAYS. AND SO OUR INTENT MOVING FORWARD. IS REALLY LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN CROSS AB PROGRAMS CROSS DEPARTMENTS LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL SILOS BREAK THEM DOWN SO THAT ARE UNDERLYING FOCUS IS ON THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE AND THEIR NEEDS. NOT THE BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURES OR PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURES THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF CONVENIENCE AND SO I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT WHERE WE DRIVE TOWARDS. I THINK THAT THIS BUDGET BEGINS TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK TOWARD SAD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THEMES OF OUR- ARMY REVISION INVESTMENTS THEY KIND OF UNDERLINE SIX DIFFERENT TEAMS IN THE CROSS. EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY AB AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY WHAT THE FOCUS OF OUR WORK AS- WITH THIS BUDGET. AND FUTURE BUDGETS MOVING FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO THANK FOR MUCH THIS THE- AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR ON GOING CONVERSATIONS IT IS- ABSOLUTELY THAT TIME FOR US TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE PROGRAMS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THE COLLABORATION THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.
