THIS IS ABOUT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS WITH IN A SPECIFIC DISTRICT OF GOVERNING BOARD IN EDUCATIONAL POLICY- ON THESE BOARDS IN THE EVENT OF A VACANCY THE REMAINING BOARD MEMBERS MUST CHOOSE TO EITHER HOLD A SPECIAL ELECTION MORE MAKE A PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENT TO SERVE THE REMAINDER OF THE FAKE. TERM VOTERS IN EACH JURISDICTION ABILITY TO TERMINATE THE APPOINTMENTS AND OPT FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT PROPONENTS COLLECT THE SIGNATURES OF REGISTERED VOTERS RANGING FROM ONE AND A HALF PERCENT 25% DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE JURISDICTION TO QUALIFY A SPECIAL ELECTION. SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS MUST PAY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR MANY SMALLER SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS SPECIAL ELECTIONS TO REPLACE PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENT SEVERELY THREATEN THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ULTIMATELY DECREASE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR STUDENT SERVICES. BUT SHOULDN'T TAKE MITCHELL REQUIREMENT FOR NEW A SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE AN ELECTED GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER RANGES FROM 10230% OF REGISTERED VOTERS DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF VOTERS IN A JURISDICTION THERE NEEDS TO BE PARITY IN THE SIGNATURE PETITION REQUIREMENTS PLACED ON INITIATING A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR BOARD MEMBERS WHAT THEY'RE DOING ELECTED. OR APPOINTED. THIS BILL WILL ALIGN THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD NEEDED TO TERMINATE A PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENT TO A SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WITH THE EXISTING THRESHOLDS FOR ELECTED MEMBERS. THE BILL REQUIRES. WAITED ELECTIONS COST EXPRESSED ON THE PETITION ON A PER STUDENT BASIS FOR DISTRICTS AND LASTLY IT PROVIDES DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO COMBINE A SPECIAL ELECTION WITH AN ALREADY SCHEDULED STATE OR LOCAL ELECTION TO STREAMLINE COSTS. IN A MINUTE YOU'LL HEAR FROM A WITNESS FROM THE MIDDLETOWN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH FACES A SPECIAL ELECTION THIS YEAR. WHICH WILL COST ANYWHERE FROM 250-008-0000 DOLLARS AND WAS INITIATED BY ONLY NINETY TWO SIGNATURES- AND LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS BILL MAINTAINS THE SECIAL ELECTIONS PROCESS FOR APPOINTED BOARD MEMBERS. ARE AS A VALID PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO. HERE TO TESTIFY- TODAY ARE CARLOS MACHADO LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND LARRY ALLEN PRESIDENT. OF THE MIDDLETOWN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE FOUR THANK YOU CENTER LEAD YOU HAVE AN ORDER THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE SPEAKER.

YES A REGARDING IMPACT THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ELECTIONS ARE HAVING ON STUDENTS IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR LODGING COST RANGE FROM HIGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SMALL DINNER FOR SMALLER DISTRICTS THESE COSTS CAN WREAK HAVOC ON SCHOOL BUDGETS AND LEAD TO CUTS TO STUDENT PROGRAMS AND STAFF POSITIONS UNFORTUNATELY MANY VOTERS ARE NOT AWARE THAT THESE COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COULD REDUCE SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. UNLIKE ADDITIONS FISSIONS CONTAIN VERY LITTLE INFORMATION NOT EVEN A STATEMENT TO VOTERS OUTLINING REASONS FOR THE ACTION SB TEN SIXTY ONE ENSURES THAT INFORMATION ON THE PETITION MAKES IT CLEAR TO VOTERS THAT SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTING ELECTION COSTS- GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS THAT ELECTION COST CAN HAVE ON. THE BILL ALSO ENSURES BROADER VOTER SENSE IS REFLECTED IN THE DECISIONS TO QUALIFY A PETITION ELECTION COST THE BILL EXPANDS THE PERIOD DURING WHICH A SCHOOL LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION MAY BE CONSOLIDATED WITH LOCAL OR STATE ELECTIONS THIS CHANGE WILL HELP WILL HELP DISTRICTS SAVE AS MUCH AS- HALF OR MORE ON ELECTION RELATED EXPENSES. MOREOVER BY COMBINING THE SPECIAL ELECTION WITH OTHER ELECTIONS SB TEN SIXTY ONE WILL HELP INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT THE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SB TEN SIXTY ONE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER MACHADO. LEXICON LARRY ALLEN TO TESTIFY STRADLIN WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN GLAZER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M LARRY ON. SKEWS ME I'M LARRY ON PRESIDENT OF MIDDLETOWN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION WHERE I'M SERVING IN MY FOURTH YEAR. I JOIN THE BOARD FOR YEARS AFTER RETIRING FROM THE DISTRICT WHERE I TAUGHT FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. IT'LL DON IS A SMALL RURAL DISTRICT. IN LAKE COUNTY ABOUT TWO HOURS NORTHWEST OF HERE. WE SERVE A LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS OVER HALF QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT SB TEN SIXTY ONE. IN DECEMBER ONE OF OUR APPOINTMENTS WAS REMOVED BY SUCCESSFUL PETITION WHICH REQUIRED ONLY. NINETY FIVE- SIGNATURES WE WERE LUCKY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE OUR SPECIAL ELECTION WITH THE PRIMARY IN JUNE. IF THE PETITION PROCESS WERE COMPLETED EARLIER OR A LITTLE LATER WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE. US OF A SPECIAL ACTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN FIFTY AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS UP 24% OF OUR TWO MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS FIRES DESTROYED HOMES IN MANY OF OUR- THE HOMES OF MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. AS A RESULT OUR ENROLLMENT HAS DROPPED ABOUT 13% WITH SCHOOL FUNDING BEING TIED TO ENROLLMENT OUR BUDGET HAS DROPPED AS WELL. BECAUSE THE BABY. WOULD FORCE US TO CUT. ONE OF OUR TEACHING STAFF AND INCREASE REMAINING CLASS SIZES SMALLER AMOUNTS COULD MEAN WE ELIMINATE OR LIMIT ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITY. CURRENT LAW HAS ENABLED SMALL GROUPS TO THREATEN THE FISCAL STABILITY OF OUR DISTRICT ADJUSTING THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLDS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THESE PETITIONS REFLECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS ALIGNING THE THRESHOLD. THOSE REQUIRED FOR ELECTIONS. MAKES SENSE IN THAT THE IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT IS THE SAME WE LOSE A BOARD MEMBER AND WE PAY FOR THE ELECTION.

MISTER CHAIR NOBODY IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME OKAY TERRIFIC WILL BE GOOD BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR- COMMENTS. SENATOR NEWMAN PRESSURE. I'M ADDRESSING THE GENTLEMAN FROM C. S. B. A. AND- SIR I MUST HAS BEEN OBSERVATION EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES HAVE NEVER MADE A FUSS OVER THIS ISSUE. BUT SOMETHING'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN AMERICA. THE PARENTS BECAUSE A CULVERT GOT A VIEW OF THE CLASSROOM. THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY SAW. SO THEY'VE INITIATED SOME RECALLS ACROSS THE LAND EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. THEY ARE DISSATISFIED IN RIGHTEOUSLY RIGHTEOUSLY AND RIGHTLY SO. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED THAT. BUT THIS IS THE CALL OF THE VOTERS WHO THEY ELECT TO THOSE SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THE BOARDS NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. AND THERE'S A MOVEMENT AMERICA AND IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THE RECALL PROCESS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. SO MY POINT TO YOU SURE AS I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR C. S. B. A. OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN MANY OCCASIONS. FOR CS BA HAS DONE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE CONTRARY. TO QUALITY EDUCATION. JUST MY OBSERVATIONS THAT AND I'D LOVE IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND PLEASE DO. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AND- YOU ARE OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT TRYING TO- CUT OFF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE A APPOINTED. BOARD MEMBER TO A BOARD- THAT'S WHAT THIS PETITION ACCOMPLISHES AND ALLOW VOTERS TO FILL THAT VACANCY- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL AT THE KEY PROVISIONS IS TO HELP REDUCE THOSE ELECTION COSTS SO THAT IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE STUDENTS THAT THOSE PARENTS ARE INTERESTED IN INTEREST IN HAVING THE DISTRICTSARE. ON AS PRESIDENT ALLEN HAD MENTIONED IN HIS TESTIMONY ARE THESE ELECTION COSTS COULD LEAD TO- DISMISSAL OF TEACHERS BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED- BUDGETARY. ONES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OTHER STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT IS THAT THE CLASSROOMS GET LARGER A MAY LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF ARTS AND- OTHER ELECTIVES IN THE SCHOOL SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACT OF THIS I GAIN SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE CAN COMBINE THESE ELECTIONS WITH OTHER LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS AND THEN MAKE THIS PROCESS- ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE IMPACT THAT IT DOES HAPPEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY ADJUSTING THE VOTER SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS. BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE- GOING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT YOU EXPRESSED ABOUT- ABOUT- BOARDS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST DO A SHOUT OUT TO MIDDLETOWN- I USED TO REPRESENT THAT COUNTY. AND I HAVE A DEAR. HEART FELT EMPATHY FOR OUR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE AN REPRESENTED NINETEEN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES OVER THE DECADES I THINK I'VE PROBABLY REPRESENTED MORE SMALL COMMUNITIES AND ANYBODY. AND THE FACT I WAS JUST UP TO THE UPPER LAKE HERE EARLIER A LOT THIS YEAR- WE MANY WHERE DECADES AGO ELEVEN EIGHTIES ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO SECURE BEFORE THE ALLOCATION BOARD FUNDING FOR A GYMNASIUM. IN UPPER LAKE AND WE'RE CELEBRATING THAT THIS YEAR STILL VERY NICE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE FOLKS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN HE SENATOR NIELSEN WOULDN'T OUT TO CENTER NEWMAN AND THANK YOU MISTER I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OBSERVATION- THEN THE VICE CHAIRMEN MIGRATION IS. AT OUR LAST SHOW YOU SEEN I THINK BECAUSE THE POLARIZATION WHERE POLITICS IS THE EXPLOITATION OF A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS THAT DATE WAY BACK TO AN EARLIER TIME THAT WERE WELL INTENTIONED AT THE TIME BUT IT BECOME- KIND OF WEAPONIZED AS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE POLARIZED MORE MORE STRANGE AND SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED WHERE SCHOOL BOARDS- HAVE BEEN SCHOOL TEACHER BECOME. UNFORTUNATE BATTLEGROUNDS FOR KIND OF PARTISAN WARFARE AND SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IN THAT AREA JOB- JUST TO ADD SOME RIGOR TO PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT FOR YOU KNOW BY NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T SUFFER. THE COST WOULD PROVIDE MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE THESE THE CONTENTIOUSNESS THAT COMES WITH THE TANKS WHAT I AM AT APPOINTMENT FOR A LIMITED ATION- WE SHOULD HAVE FAITH ENOUGH IN OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO ALLOW FOR AT. I JUST. TRY I DO TOO GENERALLY TO GET GOOD AND RISK MEASURE GLENN SUPPORT TO MOVE IT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA RECOGNIZED MOTION JUST A MOMENT CENTER THEIR DOT DON'T THINK IT'S ANY FOR QUESTIONS FROM THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TOPLAY YES THANK YOU A PRIEST PEOPLE CAME AND SPOKE. APPRECIATE THE CALM OF THE AND WE JUST THIS DOES NOT CHIU. THE LAWS FOR EXISTING RECALLS FOR EXISTING FULL TERM SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS IT DOES NOT CHANGED IT JUST ADDRESSES THE- THE ISSUE THAT SENATOR NEWMAN- OF MENTIONED ED THROUGHOUT THE CENTER NIELSEN- IN THE ONE UP CATEGORY I REPRESENT THE SMALLEST K. THROUGH TWELFTH DISTRICT IN THE STATE AND ROMAN IN THE SOUTHERN BIG SUR COAST THERE SEVENTEEN STUDENTS IN A K. THROUGH TWELFTH DISTRICT AND FIVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND IF THEY WERE TO GO TO ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL BE A TWO HOUR ROUND TRIP TO THE SOUTH OF THE THREE AND A HALF HOUR ROUND TRIP TO THE NORTH AND THE HIGHWAY WAS OUT HALF THE TIME IN SO IF THEY HAD A VACANCY IN THAT DISTRICT. IT IS THIS MAY. BUDGET AND IT WOULD BE A MONUMENTAL TO FILL. AND WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT INJUSTICE AND SO. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. REBEKAH GOOD THOUGHTFUL BILL THANK YOU CENTER LATER THAN A RECOGNIZE THE MOTION CONSENTED TO NEWMAN. THIS WOULD BE- DO PASSED THE FIRST STEP TO BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- WITH THE CONSULTANT CALL THE ROLL. YOUR MICROPHONE ON. YOUR USE. ALL RIGHT- SB TEN SIXTY ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER HI GLAZER HI NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG LEYVA NEWMAN NEWMAN HI. OKAY THAT- BILL- IS TWO TO ONE WITH MEMBERS ABSENCE WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU CENTER THERE OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO NOW TO- AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWO. SB THIRTEEN FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR ALAN. YOU COULD ARGUE THE DAGEN MORNING CENTER ALLEN I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A QUIET AND RESTFUL MORNING TO COME BEFORE US TODAY WELCOME WELL COUPLE COUPLE CALLS FROM THE CHAIR WHICH I APPRECIATED- SO I DO I DO APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS AND IS NOW ON THIS POLICY AND- WE'RE WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. ON THIS ALTERNATE ABOUT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION DISCLOSURES WHICH- I CERTAINLY CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL USED TO SHED LIGHT ON INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES ARE PROVIDING. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE- SO CALIFORNIA. ARE CANDIDATES FOR STATE ELECTED OFFICE INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY RECEIVE ON A SEMI ANNUAL. OUR REPORTS THAT THEY THAT THEY SUBMIT TO THE CONFERENCE ACTORS STATE. AND THEY'RE TO ACTIVITY REPORT REQUIREMENTS SO CONTRIBUTIONS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE MADE TO A CANDIDATE DURING THE NINETY DAY PERIOD PRECEDING AN ELECTION MUST BE REPORTED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AS WE ALL KNOW. THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR REPORTING PERIOD OUTSIDE OF THE NINETY DAY ALEXION PERIOD CONTRIBUTIONS A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE MISTER REPORT WITHIN TEN DAYS. AND THIS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD IS REALLY HELPFUL FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS OF LARGER COUNTRY CONTRIBUTORS IN THE NON ELECTION PERIOD BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE TIMELY TRANSPARENCY IN. FROM ANY SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS. ARE THE EXISTING TIMELINE FOR FILING SEMI ANNUAL ANOTHER ELECTION PERIOD REPORTS. RESULTING CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER FIVE THOUSAND THAT CAN GO MANY MANY MONTHS BEFORE. THE MISREPORTED AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS- YESTERDAY MISTER CHAIR. ADDITIONALLY OF COURSE THE CURRENT INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT TO LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES FOR NET FOR YOUR FORTY NINE HUNDRED- WHICH IS LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND ON ELECTION PERIOD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SO CANDIDATES FOR THESE OFFICES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY LARGE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY RECEIVE OUTSIDE OF THE NINETY DAY ELECTION PERIOD UNTIL OUR NEXT SEMI ANNUAL OR- ELECTION PERIOD FILING. SO IS ABOUT TRYING TO INCREASE PUBLIC ACCESS TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION INFORMATION- THE BILL SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE PRINCIPLES BY EXPANDING YOUR AROUND CONTRIBUTION DISCLOSURES LAUREN IN ON ELECTION PERIOD REPORTING THRESHOLD AND THE REPORTING TIMELINE. AT THE CHAIRED REMAIN AND ENOUGH WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUT SOME- SOME CHANGES TO THE BILL MISTER CHAIR THAT I'M I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TO ARTICULATE- THAT I THINK YOU'RE- CHANGE AROUND SOME OF THE DETAILS BUT STILL. AT THE CORE GET TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT- THERE'S MORE TIMELY DISCLOSURE OF OVER OF HOW OF LARGE. CONTRIBUTIONS OUTSIDE OF THAT NINETY DAY PERIOD. ALSO WITH ME THIS MORNING WE HAVE MICHAEL OUT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR- AND I DON'T. THANK YOU SENATOR AL WILL GO TO YOUR FOR FIRST WITNESS SEVEN STREET BELOW. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE AND YOU CAN BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL OF SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT FOR CALIFORNIA THE CORE PRINCIPLE I THINK SENATOR ALAN ARTICULATED PERFECTLY. IS TO- HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS BE REPORTED- AS- POSSIBLE PRESENT LAW AS THE SENATOR NOTED DOES ALLOW- A SO CALLED MAX OUT CONTRIBUTIONS. OUTSIDE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR REPORTING PERIOD TO GO MANY MONTHS BEFORE IT IS- REPORTED ACTUALLY. OFTEN PASSED THE PRIMARY ITSELF. AND SO- GOVERN FOR CALIFORNIA SIMPLY LOOKING FOR- AS TRANSPARENT SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE- ALSO UTILIZING AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOPEFULLY TECHNOLOGY WE OUGHT TO BE- CAPITALIZING ON. COMPUTERS TO HAVE EARLY REPORTING. WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH THE CONSULTANT. BEFORE TO WORKING YOU AS BILL MOVES FORWARD IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND FOR THAT WE WOULD ASK AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR BELOW HIS OR ANYONE ELSE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

MR SURE NOBODY IS KILLING OUT OKAY TERRIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR NEWMAN I DIED OF YOUR SENIORITY HERE HERTZBERG IT WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG AND- YEAH WHAT WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THIS BILL CENTER ALLEN IS. THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND TO RAISE MONEY I SPENT PROBABLY 20% OF THE MONEY I HAVE TO RAISE A COMPLIANCE NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO THE F. PPC HAS JUST BEEN A GOTCHA GAME I FILE THE FOUR HUNDRED SOME PAGE COMPLAINT FOR YEARS AGO INVOLVING SOMETHING THEY HAVE ACTED ON IT INVOLVING A CAMPAIGN THING THAT HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMEBODY MISSES SOMETHING BY A DAY AND THEY COME AFTER YOU. AND IT'S SO HARD BECAUSE THERE'S SO FEW PEOPLE THAT DO COMPLIANCE AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THEY'VE GOT ALL THE SHORT DEADLINES YOU MISSED IT BY FOR TEN SECONDS AND THEY FILED AN ACTION AGAINST YOU AND THEN SOMEONE CLAIMS THAT YOU'RE THIS HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING. ALL YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW YOU BASICALLY PUT SOME BURDEN ON PEOPLE BOOK I HAVE WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE ON THE STUFF AND I'VE MADE MISTAKES SOME OF THAT I WAS INVOLVED WITH PROP. SIXTY EIGHT WAS INVOLVING POP ONE THIRTY ONE ALL OF THIS CAMPAIGN FINANCE MEASURE H. IN LOS ANGELES AND AFTER I JUST AT SOME LEVEL I KNOW SOMEBODY WILL SAY YOU SHOULD BE ASKING. I'M SORRY FOCUS ON THE DETAILS IN THIS BUSINESS AND THE IDEA HERE IS DISCLOSURE THE IDEAS. TRANSPARENCY COMPLETE. WITH THE I. D. NOT TOUCHING. THE IDEA IS. IT IS THAT YOU GOT A FIVE DAY WINDOW. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DISCLOSE ADDITIONAL QUESTION TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FINE. BUT NOW THE RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF. OF WORK THAT REQUIRES OF THIS TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL OF WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU GOT TO PUT IT IN YOUR I'M SCARED TO DEATH IF EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE SHOULD BE SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE YOU WANT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND SO MY BIGGER ISSUES THE FIVE DAYS OR IF YOU HAVE FIVE DAYS WHEN AB IT'S- WE ARE ONLY TEN DAYS. AGO SEARCH I WAS LATE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING FROM TEN TO FIVE. NOW WE'RE WE'RE GONNA STAY WITH THE TEN K. AUGUST OF THE TYRESE AND WE HAD A WHOLE. YEAH AS THEY SAY IN. AS SANTA DENNIS SAYS. REMIND ALL RIGHT AND THERE'S BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONVERSATION I KNOW AND YOU'RE YOU HAVE TO I MEAN THE GOOD. I THINK WE ALL AGREE. SOME WAY TO DO IT PERFECTLY IT'S FINE. I JUST WENT OVER THE GOTCHA GAME AND ALSO JUST THE CRUSH. AND HAVE A VOICE ON THAT AND PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT- IF THE TERRORIST ON THAT. ALIBIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT LEAST YOU'LL HEAR SOME CONVERSATION ON THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. OKAY A SENATOR NEWMAN I'M SORRY I GUESS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION. WOW IT'S PROBABLY A LOT OF CONFIDENCE ONE INCIDENT. OKAY BUT YOU KNOW YOU FOR MY PART BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS. CERTAINLY A WORTHY. YOU KNOW THE SET OF GOALS HERE OF% THE COMPLETED WITH TRANSPARENCY'S IMPORTANT. TO MR BALOCH POINT I THINK TEN YEARS AGO YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS WAS. ONEROUS I THINK TODAY ALL THE TOOLS ARE. THOROUGHLY IN PLACE SETTING WITH SOME THOUGHTFUL. IMPLEMENTATION IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT ARE ALIGNED REPORTING PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL AND I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT. I THINK YOU TO DRESS- MANY OF CENTER HERTZBERG. ISSUES AROUND HERE- I WOULD PROBABLY URGE. SOME CONSIDERATION ABOUT UNITY PROVISIONS FOR CURE- MAYBE A SLIDING SCALE YOU KNOW TO WEAR TO HIS POINT WHERE IT'S NOT BINARY YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT EITHER PURE OR GUILTY. BUT BUT THE INCENTIVES TO REPORT THEIR OF THE OBLIGATION REPORT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS SO WE ALL USE- IF USED RUSSIAN TREASURY WE ALL USE. SYSTEMS ARE THOSE SYSTEMS SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO INTEGRATE WITH THESE REPORTING PROCESS ESPECIALLY WITH THE IPC SYSTEMS DR GRANT SUPPORT THOSE SANCTIONS LIVER WORK LEFT HAPPY HAPPY TO VOTE FOR IT. AND TO MOVE AT THE PERFECT TIME. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN- CENTER I WANT TO. JOIN IN THIS CONVERSATION I HAVE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS SPACE AND ADDS THAT OTHERS IN THE COMMITTEE VINDICATED YOU TRANSPARENCY IS A HEALTHY THING WE WANNA. ALLEN COURAGE THAT. BUT THE CHALLENGE THAT I WAS HAVING WITH THE WITH YOUR BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN. IS I WAS TRYING TO SEE WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE SOLVING WHAT WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE SOLVING AND- I'LL BY DEFINITION IN YOUR BILL- YOU BY NOT IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM UNTIL AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED. AT THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION AND IS A CONTRIBUTION LOWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND BUT ABOVE- A THOUSAND. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR ELECTION CYCLE GOING BACK TWO DECADES THAT WE'VE HAD IT. AND WE HAD THESE DISCLOSURES WHERE YOU FEEL THERE'S BEEN AN ABUSE THAT IN A MINUTE ELATION AS OCCURRED. WHERE SOMEONE HAS RECEIVED CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO DISCLOSE MONTHS AND MONTHS BEFORE THE A LOT. OF VOTERS HAVE BEEN ILL SERVED. WELL I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ABUSE BUT I DO THINK THAT THE VOTERS BEEN ILL SERVED AND SO I WE YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT HOW THERE ARE THESE- THE PAPER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE AND SO LITTLE EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN SO DO YOU HAVE SO THAT TAKES SO MUCH TIME TO FIND OUT BASICS ABOUT A CAMPAIGN FINANCE- YOU KNOW IN AN EARLIER STAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN SO ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS HAVE SOME MORE TIMELY REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE. BUT THINGS LIKE THE FIVE TO TEN DAYS NO PROBLEM I MEAN THAT THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S IT THAT'S IT THAT'S NOT A MEANINGFUL AT THE CONCESSION FROM UP TRANSPARENCY PERSPECTIVE BUT IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOTCHA GAME THAT THAT THE SENATOR WAS TALKING ABOUT SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I'M SO HAPPY TO- TO BE FLEXIBLE ON BUT THE BUT THE BROAD CONCEPT OF. GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE- SHINING A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON ON ON A ON A CAMPAIGN FINANCING- AT THE EARLIER STAGE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT LITTLE MONTHS UNTIL THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT TO KNOW WHAT THE BASICS ARE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S CAMPAIGN IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT HERE THAT IT- SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'S HARD TO SEE A CONTRIBUTION GIVEN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND THAT THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT DISCLOSE FOR OF A NUMBER OF MONTHS AS A MATERIAL AFFECT AN ELECTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT HAPPENING FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS LATER SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CURRENT ELECTION YEAR TWENTY TWO CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN IN TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SEMIANNUAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO THAT POINT IN TIME. AND THERE'S DISCLOSURE MONTHS AND MONTHS BEFORE AN ELECTION WHERE IF YOU HAD SOMEONE WHO FELT THAT THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE- THAT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY ONCE IN MONTHS OF OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. A ISSUE OF IF YOU DECIDED TO DO IT- SO I DON'T REALLY SEE WHERE WE'RE CLOSING ANY KIND OF TRANCE. GAP IN THE PRIOR ELECTION YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION. NOW NEVERTHELESS I DO HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION TO PUT FORWARD. I THINK WHERE THERE IS A GAP IN OUR DISCLOSURE HAPPENS DURING THE ELECTION YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE A CANDIDATE- THAT AT THAT- THAT- WITH THE DECLARED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR OR YOU'RE AN ACTIVE CANDIDATE. BUT IN JANUARY OF THE OF THE YEAR UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. THERE IS NO DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS- IF YOU DON'T. SEE THE CONTRIBUTION OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE HAVE A DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT NINETY DAYS BEFORE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. SO THERE'S A GAP THERE- AND IN FACT ANY CONTRIBUTION THAT YOU RECEIVED IN THE FIRST. ALMOST FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR YOU'RE NOT EVEN REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE UNTIL THE END OF APRIL THE FIRST PRE ELECTION REPORT. SO I DO SEE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS CLOSER TO ELECTION I DO SEE YOU GET INTO THIS PLACE THE SPACE OF POTENTIALLY HAVING INTO A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ELECTION. ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING ALL MAIL BALLOTS. THE ACTUAL OPERATIVE DATE OF THE ELECTION IS NOT IN OUR CASE JUNE SEVENTH AND THIS YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY BEGINS THE BEGINNING OF MAY SO ACTUALLY. THE THE ABILITY TO AFFECT AN ELECTION I CAN ACTUALLY HAPPENED A LOT EARLIER- GIVEN THE- HOW WE'VE IMPROVED OUR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT OKAY. SO I DO SEE AND THIS IS A CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION I'M I'M WILLING TO HAVE YOUR BILL GO FORWARD WITH MY SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEES WILLING. BUT HERE'S WHERE I THINK THE GAP COULD BE CLOSED THAT HAS A MATERIAL EFFECT WOULD BE MAKING TWO CHANGES. NUMBER ONE IT WOULD BE CREATING AN EARLIER PRE ELECTION REPORT ANY. DAY AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO BE AT THE CLOSE OF THE PERIOD OF FEBRUARY. TO BE REPORTED IN THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. AND NUMBER TWO WOULD BE TO TAKE THE- THOUSAND DOLLAR DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT CURRENTLY IS NINETY DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND MOVE IT TO A HUNDRED DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. NOW YOU'VE CLOSED THE COMPLETE GAP. IN THE ELECTION YEAR FOR DISCLOSURE BY DOING THOSE TWO THINGS YEAH. I THINK THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN WHAT YOUR BILL WILL REQUIRE. IT ONLY CREATES A ONE OBLIGATION OF A CANDIDATE WHICH IS THE NEW PRE ELECTION AT THE END OF FEBRUARY. TO BE REPORTED THE BEGINNING OF MARCH. AND THEN IT ADDS AT TEN DAY EXTENSION TO THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR REPORT. YOU CLOSE THE GAP. AND HE A YOU TAKEN AWAY THIS REPORTING OBLIGATION AND OF AND A YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION. WHICH I THINK CREATES A- A- PAPERWORK TRAP FOR ANY CANDIDATE. BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY TRYING TO CLOSE. BETWEEN TWENTY- FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR WHATEVER ENDING BELOW FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ASSETS- THAT THAT WOULD BE MY CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION HOW TO DO WHAT I THINK YOU ACCOMPLISH WHAT MUCH OF WHAT YOU WANT WITHOUT READING THAT PAPER RETRACTED. THAT WE'VE ALL FALLEN INTO. SO YOU ARE YOUR SUGGESTIONS VERY WELCOME- THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS THAT- LEASE ON THE ELECTION YEAR IS THAT WE SEEM WE ARE STRUGGLING BETWEEN WHETHER GONNA HAVE MARCH PRIMARIES IN JUNE PRIMARY SO WE HAVE TO JUST FIGURE OUT. HOW THAT PLAYS BASED ON A DIFFERENT PRIMARY DATE. THE ONLY THE ONLY THE ONLY PUSH BACK I'D I'D I'D PUT ON THE ON THE QUESTION OF PREVIOUS YEARS. IS THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT I'M THE EARLY DAYS OF ELECTION ALSO INVALID SELECTION RIGHT IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE MONEY GAME YOU KNOW WHO RAISES THE MOST MONEY OUT THE GATE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AN ELECTION STARTS. JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE CALENDAR YEAR. BUILDING UP TO THE ELECTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT EARLY FUNDRAISING IS AN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. IN HELPING TO DETERMINE THE WAY THAT OUR RACE- EVOLVES AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO INFLUENCE THAT THAT THE MONEY CAN POTENTIALLY. SHED LIGHT ON OUR TO ELECTED OFFICIALS SO. I'M I'M I'M WHAT I LOVE TO DO- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ASTIR JERRY IS TO JUST. MAYBE FIGURE OUT A- A SYSTEM FOR THE PRE FOR THE PRE ELECTION YEARS. THAT PROVIDES SOME MORE DISCLOSURE THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE. BUT THAT IS NOT AS RIGOROUS. AS WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING FOR THE ELECTION YEAR. AND I THINK IF WE CAN. WORK WITH THAT CORE CONCEPT ON SOME DETAILS TOGETHER AS IF THE BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I THAT WOULD I WAS REALLY MAKE ME FEEL. HAPPY THAT I WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE FINE TO DO THAT. I WOULD NOTE THAT- AN EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST GAVE. THAT THOSE WHO WANT TO SHOW THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AS A MEASURE OF STRENGTH- THAT DOESN'T CONFORM WITH THE ELECTION. REPORTS THE SEMIANNUAL REPORTS HAS EVERY RIGHT TO GO AHEAD MAKE ANY DECLARATION OR DISCLOSURE. THEY HAVE. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE- AND ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE THAT SOMEHOW SOMEONE TAKING A CONTRIBUTION A YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION. I WOULD SOMEHOW SOMEHOW HAVE IMMUNITY. IS IT REALLY THE CASE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT. FOR FIVE OR MORE MONTHS BEFORE AN ELECTION WHERE ANYONE CAN SEE THOSE DISCLOSURES AND TAKE WHATEVER MAKE WHATEVER OPINION THEY WOULD HAVE. ABOUT IT. NEVERTHELESS I APPRECIATE THE GOALS THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHING YOUR BILL I THINK THAT WE CAN WORK ON THOSE TOGETHER. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IF THE COMMITTEE AGREES GO AHEAD. YEAH BRIEFLY. I THINK CENTER ON AND I THINK YOU MITCH REALLY GOOD POINT. EARLY MONEY GOES MOSTLY UNEXAMINED- BUT IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT- AS TO POSITIONING AS TO VIABILITY AND I THINK IT'S RELEVANT. TO SHED AS MUCH LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AS TO WHO SUPPORT SECOND WHO IS ME THEY CAN'T A VIABLE. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE OFTEN FORGET THAT. THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD- IS. THE REASON WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON A THOUSAND BOX IS REAL MONEY. RIGHT REAL MONEY AND SO IT IS MORE THAN WORTHWHILE TO ME. TO HAVE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE A BASIS FOR SAYING. YOU YOU KNOW WHO GIVE SMALL YOU GUYS BIG MONEY BIG MONEY IS WHAT DETERMINES VIABILITY- CONTEXT I THINK IT'S EVERYTHING YOU THINK TO DO YOU KNOW TO YOUR THINKING. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE BY THE SUBMISSION DEADLINES ARE A BIG DEAL IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GETS REPORTED THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE- THE TRACTION POINTS OF THE MILESTONES YOUR- YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN THE SCOOTY SUPPLIED. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ASPIRE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE TO REAL TIME REPORTING. TO MR BALOCH POINT ABOUT SYSTEMS- AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU KNOW THERE SHOULD BE MORE OR LESS CONTINUAL. AND THAT LEVEL TRANSPARENCY WOULD DO TWO THINGS- IT WOULD GIVE. VOTERS TO MAKE FULL. MISTER WHO SUPPORTS HIM. BUT ALSO GIVE A VERY DIFFERENT BASIS FOR YOU KNOW THE REPORTING ON RACES AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE STRESS OUT OF THESE MILESTONES. MULLIN I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA- REMEMBER WHO PAYS. FOR ELECTIONS IT'S NOT THE LITTLE GUY. SENATOR JUST I JUST TO SAY MY COMMON- WHICH- NEWMAN AYE AYE COMPLETELY AGREE DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE. HOW CAN YOU DO THAT WITHOUT CHAU BURDENING THE SYSTEM WOULD COST SO MUCH MONEY AND YOU PLAY THE GOTCHA GAME THAT WOULD CONCERN BY. COFFEE INFORMED. THINKING EARLIER- BUT IT WAS AND IT WAS IN THE DANNATT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THIS FOR SO LONG AND I. HAVE SPENT SO MUCH OF MY LIFE INVOLVEMENT WE GET ALL THE VOTER STUFF TOGETHER IN THE SAME DAY VOTING. TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATION ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY IT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS COMMITTEE IN WHICH WE SHOULD DO OUR DEMOCRACY SO I'M- I'M ALL WITHIN A BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ELEMENT I JUST WANT TO BALANCE OUT THOSE ELEMENTS OF COST. AND GOTCHA IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND YEAH WEEK IF WE COULD DO REAL TIME REPORTING THAT WOULD BE THE BEST. AT ALL TIMES TO BE THE BEST FOR EVERYTHING. YEAH I MEAN OF COURSE THAT'S A THAT'S A BURDEN RIGHT I MEAN SO. THAT'S A- LOT OF. TWENTY THREE NO NOT NOT REALLY IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF A BURDEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL OUT THE REPORTS THAT LITERALLY. THERE WAS A SYSTEM BUILT WITH THE SECTOR STATES OFFICE WHEN THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE YOU CLICK THE BUTTON. THAT IS NOT VERY HARD TO DO. YOUR POINT IS WE JUST DO REAL TIME REPORTING AND BUT THE REPORTS A LOT WHAT DO YOU DO REAL TIME REPORTING REPORTS AREN'T THAT IT WOULD TAKE UP THE THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARY AND IT BECOMES A WHOLE DIFFERENT PLACE I THINK ISN'T WHAT LET'S TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M NOT. YOU KNOW. BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME WAYS TO DO IT ELECTRONICALLY WE SPENT SOME TIME WITH SECRETARY PER DIEM. FOR CAME YOUR CENTER AND IF YOU RECALL WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TO UPDATE THE CALYX EXISTENCE. AND TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE IT'LL SLOWER COMING TO FORTUNE ON THAT. BUT I DO THINK TECHNOLOGICALLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WAYS TO. HUNDREDS MAYBE OVERSTATEMENT BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS WE CAN BE CREATIVE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND COST A BUNCH. THE RELEASE. TO DO FOR COMMENTS CENTER DEALS YOU HAVING NO OKAY ALL RIGHT- SENATE ALLEN LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I LOOK I APPRECIATE THESE COMMENTS AND- I YOU KNOW THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THIS IS THE WISDOM OF THE COMMITTEE PROCESS WHEN WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET AN IDEA ON PAPER AND THEN START THE DISCUSSION AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU ALL. HAVE GRASS GOALS THAT WE HAVE HERE AND NOW IT'S A MATTER OF TINKERING THE BILL TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE REACH THOSE GOALS IN A WAY THAT IS REALLY THE MOST EFFICACIOUS. FOR OUR SYSTEM AND DOES. NOT END UP. PUTTING MORE. UP MARKET MORE COMPLIANCE BURDEN ON FOLKS WITHOUT THE CONCOMITANT- TRANSPARENCY GOAL SO. I'M TO THIS APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL TODAY AND DISCUSSION AS THIS MOVES TO REPROACH- TO SEE IF WE CAN HONE ASPECTS OF THE BILL A TO RETURN CALLS. IT THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN WITH THEM IN A RECOGNIZED MOTION CENTER NEWMAN. TO MOVE THE BILL AS IS- SO THIS WOULD BE PASSED THE FIRST REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. WITH THE CONSULTANT CALL THE ROLL. SB THIRTEEN FIFTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER HI GLAZER HI NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG NEWMAN HI OKAY THAT BILL CURRENTLY ENJOYS A THREE TO ONE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE YEARS I'LL BE PRESENTING THE NEXT BILL. YEAH. YEAH THE. ALL RIGHT SHERMAN GLAZER YOU HAVE A BILL BEFORE US TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PRESENT YOUR- SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THANK YOU I CHAIRED NIELSEN GOOD EIGHTY WOULD PERMIT THE SECRETARY OF STATE I ONE UNDERSCORE PERMIT. THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CERTIFY A REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM AND I'M GONNA USE THAT WORD A LOT REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL BUT I'M TO USE THE INITIALS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER R. A. V. B. M. THE SYSTEM PROVIDES AN OPTION- FOR VOTERS WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY TO ELECTRONICALLY RETURNED THEIR BALLOTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW VOTERS ARE ABLE TO USE IN OUR A. V. B. M. SYSTEM TO ELECTRONICALLY RECEIVE AND COMPLETE A BALLOT THAT SYSTEM ALLOWED TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES TO USE THEIR ACCESSIBLE HOME TECHNOLOGY. TO READ MARK THEIR BALLOTS PRIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY. HOWEVER VOTERS REQUIRED TO RETURN A PRINTED COPY AS THEY WOULD RETURN TO TRADITIONAL PAPER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. WHILE REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTING HAS IMPROVED VOTING AT HOME FOR MANY VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. IS STILL DIFFICULT FOR BIRDS WITH VISUAL AND DEXTERITY IMPAIRMENTS TO VOTE PIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY YOU'RE USING THE CURRENT SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE VOTER WHO IS BLIND USING THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT HAVE A PRIVATE AND INDEPENDENT BUILDING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO HELP THEM WITH PRINTING THE BALLOT AND COMPLETING THE ENVELOPE REQUIREMENTS. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY PERMITS PERMITS THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CERTIFY AND R. A. V. B. M. SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR VOTERS WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY TO ELECTRONICALLY RETURNED ABOUT. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY ALSO PROVIDES THE SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE ESTABLISHED AND ACCESSIBLE WAY FOR VOTER WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY TO SUBMIT. A SIGNATURE TRONIC LEE. UPON SERVE OF A- ELECT BALLOT RETURN OPTION. UPON CERTIFICATION OF AN ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN OPTION I COUNTY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERMIT A VOTER WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY. TO USE THAT ARE A V. V. M. SYSTEM. IF THE SYSTEM IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR USE IN A VOTERS COUNTY VOTER WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY WOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN A BALLOT BY FAX. NOW I THEIR SECURITY CONCERNS WITH THIS CHANGEYES. AND THOSE CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CERTIFYING A SYSTEM. IN THE END IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE DOES NOT FEEL THE SYSTEM IS READY FOR USE FOR WHATEVER REASON. THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD NOT APPROVE THAT SYSTEM. HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME WE SHOULD NOT PREVENT A GROUP OF VOTERS FROM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY IS ABOUT IMPROVING ACCESS FOR VOTERS WHO FACE A BARRIER WHEN SEEKING TO VOTE IN AN INDEPENDENCE. AND PRIVATE MATTER THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL TO BE APPROPRIATE TIME. WITH ME THIS MORNING IS PAUL SPENCER WITH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND JEFF TOM WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER SPENCER. WELCOME MR SPENCER PLEASE PROCEED. ONE OF THE I'M NOT HIM WE'LL HEAR FROM YOU THEN SIR OKAY THE STOCK BY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- I MY NAME IS JEFF TOM I AM THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK CHAIR GLAZER- FOR AUTHORING THE BILL AND URGE ITS SUPPORT BY THIS COMMITTEE. IMAGINE YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA VOTER WHO OPTS TO VOTE BY MAIL. IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THAT MARKING THE BALLOT REQUIRED A SPECIAL PENCIL. AND THE ONLY THING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PENCIL IS THAT ONCE YOU MARK YOUR BALLOT IT WOULD BECOME INVISIBLE TO YOU. NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT YOU WHEN I MARK MY BALLOT ON MY COMPUTER AND SEND IT TO MY PRINTER. I CANNOT. I CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THE PRINTER RAN OUT OF INK OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM OCCURRED. SO I CAN EITHER HAVE TWO OPTIONS I CAN EITHER SHOW IT TO SOMEONE ELSE AND GIVE UP MY PRIVACY. OR I CAN TAKE IT ON FAITH. AND SEND THE BALLOT IN. THIS BILL WOULD ALLEVIATE THAT PROBLEM AND ALLOW ME TO VOTE COMPLETELY PRIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY. SOMETHING THAT ALL VOTERS WITH OR WITHOUT DISABILITIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. IT WILL ALSO HELP PEOPLE WHO DO NOT OWN A PRINTER. AND OF COURSE WILL HELP PEOPLE WITH OTHER DISABILITIES INCLUDING DEXTERITY DISABILITIES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT IS A REASONABLE BILL AND HAS THE APPROPRIATE REQUIREMENTS BUILT INTO IT TO ASSURE THAT THE BILL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER TOM MISTER SPENCER. THE MORNING CARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PAUL SPENCER AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY. IN THE VOTING RIGHTS PRACTICE GROUP DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE STATEWIDE NONPROFIT PROTECTION ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF ALL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY. THIS BILL PERMITS THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CERTIFY IN OUR AB BM- SYSTEM THE PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR SOMEBODY WITH A QUALIFYING DISABILITY. ELECTRONICALLY RETURNS ARE VALID. SO IT IN ORDER FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES TO HAVE A TRULY PRIVATE AND INDEPENDENT VOTING EXPERIENCE MANY STATES AND LOCALITIES OF ADOPTED ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN OPTION. AS PART OF THEIR ABSENTEE VOTING SYSTEM. BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY FOURTEEN STATES HAVE SOME FORM OF ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. FEDERAL LAW IS NOT A BARRIER TO LECTURE ON THE BALLOT RETURN. FURTHERMORE THE STATE'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE RETURNED OUT RETURN OPTION FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES IS LIKELY A VIOLATION OF TITLE TO THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. AND SECTION FIVE OH FOUR OF THE REHABILITATION ACT. SO THE LACK OF AN ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN OPTION FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES VIOLATES THESE LAWS BECAUSE OF A LACK WILL ACCESS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA OFFERS AN ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN OPTION FOR ANOTHER VOTERS MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTERS. SO MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTERS CAN RETURN ABOUT BY FAX. THERE'S ALSO NOTHING TO CURRENTLY PREVENT THEM FROM SENDING THE BALLOT BEGET KEY FACTS TO THEIR COUNTY ELECTIONS LINE. ADDITIONALLY ARE THERE'SA FEDERAL AGENCY THAT WILL ACCEPT EMAIL BALLOTS ON BEHALF OF MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTERS AND THEN FAX IT DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICE. SO SB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN OR FORTY WILL CREATE ELECTRONIC RETURN OPTION IT'S BUILT ONTO THE EXISTING REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM AND WILL USE MODERN COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD OF RELYING ON FACTS. THE TRANSMITTER BALLOTS RECEIVED BY COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICES PRINTED. AND THEN COUNTED JUST LIKE OTHER BALLOTS. THERE ARE SECURITY RISKS WITH EVERY ELECTION SYSTEM BUT WE MUST BALANCE SECURITY WITH ACCESSIBILITY. SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY IS A TARGETED APPROACH USING EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. THAT OTHER STATES ARE USING. ADDING AN ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN OPTION CALIFORNIA FOR VOTERS OF THE QUALIFYING DISABILITIES. IS GOOD FOR ACCESSIBILITY. IT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE IT'S SUFFICIENTLY SECURE IMPRACTICAL TO IMPLEMENT FOR COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS. FOR THESE REASONS THE R. C. SUPPORTS THIS BILL. AND THANK YOU AND WE REQUEST YOUR I. THANK YOU SIR. DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SUPPORT. WITH THE HELP AND ASSISTANCE OF OUR SERGEANT SIR PLEASE VERIFY YOURSELF.

PLEASE PROCEED MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M KIM ALEXANDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA VOTER FOUNDATION AND WE OPPOSE SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY AS EXPRESSED IN THE DRAIN POSITION LETTER WE CO AUTHORED WITH VERIFIED VOTING AND ALSO ENDORSED BY THE BRENNAN CENTER WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THIS BILL BE AMENDED TO STUDY RATHER THAN OPEN THE DOOR TO IMPLEMENT ALTERNATIVE BALLOT RETURN METHODS FOR VOTERS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES. THE ARGUMENT THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING THIS- CALIFORNIA SHOULD TO WAS MADE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN PAPERLESS ELECTRONIC VOTING STARTED TO BE WIDELY ADOPTED RATHER THAN GOING ALONG WITH WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOINGCALIFORNIA'S LAWMAKERS TOOK THE LEAD IN PIVOTING OUR STATE AND NATION TOWARD VOTER VERIFIED PAPER BALLOTS OTHER STATES FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD AND BY TWENTY TWENTY PAPERLESS. VOTING WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY AROUND A KID WHEN I HERE'S LOSING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE REFUSED TO CONCEDE AND INSISTED AND CONTINUES TO INSIST THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM HIM THROUGH WIDE SCALE ELECTION FRAUD IT LED TO VIOLENT POLITICAL EXTREMIST CONSPIRING TO HALT THE CERTIFICATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTING IN A BLOODY INSURRECTION IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL WITH THREATS TO HANG THE VICE PRESIDENT LAWMAKERS AND STAFF CARRYING IN THEIR OFFICES AND FIVE LIVES LOST. FORTUNATELY ON PAPER ILYIN THOSE BALLOTS WERE AUDITED COUNTED AND RECOUNTED GIVING ALEXION OFFICIALS THE EVIDENCE THEY NEEDED TO RESPOND THE RATIONS BIG LIE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ABLE TO ASSURE VOTERS ARE ELECTIONS ARE SECURE BECAUSE OUR STATE VOTING SYSTEMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE AT. PLEASE DO NOT IN THE DOOR MORE. ELECT VOTING AS OVER THE INTERNET AND INTRODUCED RISKY VOTING PRACTICES CALIFORNIA SHOULD REMAIN A LEADER AND ELECTION SECURITY. SECURITY AND ACCESSIBILITY ARE NOT VALUES IN VOTING SYSTEMS THAT MUST BE BALANCED WITHOUT SECURITY THERE IS NO VOTING SYSTEM THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE CAN IMPROVE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR VOTING SYSTEM WITHOUT SUBVERTING IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW DO WE HAVE DOCTOR JEFFERSON. YES THANK YOU SENATORS- HI I'M DAVID JEFFERSON AND I'M A COMPUTER SCIENTIST WHO'S BEEN STUDYING THE ELECTION INTEGRITY AND INTERNET VOTING IN PARTICULAR FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I HAVE ALSO SERVED IN ADVISORY CAPACITY TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIVE SECRETARIES OF STATE AND TODAY I REPRESENT- FREE SPEECH FOR PEOPLE AND OVER THIRTY OTHER ELECTION INTEGRITY ORGANIZATIONS. JOINT OPPOSING THIS BILL WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DISABLED VOTERS DO FACE SERIOUS VOTING OBSTACLES AND WE APPLAUD THOSE INTENT TO HELP THEM VOTE PRIVATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY BUT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WILL MAKE DISABLED VOTERS BALLOTS VULNERABLE TO MANIPULATION BY BY US- CYBER ATTACKS. INTERACTION THE- INTEGRITY OF ALL CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS THE DANGER THAT WE BELIEVE OVERRIDES THE ACCESSIBILITY ADVANTAGE MIGHT OTHERWISE PROVIDE ELECTRONIC R. A. B. B. M. AS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS BILL IS JUST A FORM OF INTERNET VOTING AND AS SUCH IT IS SUBJECT TO A WHOLE SUITE OF PROFOUNDLY DANGEROUS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES INHERITED BY ALL SUCH SYSTEMS THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES THE TRIPOLI S. SISTER MISSED THE EAC THE F. B. I. AND NUMEROUS INDEPENDENT EXPERTS AND STUDIES HAVE ALL WARNED OF THE DANGERS AND IT CONCLUDES. THAT NO FEE OF INR COULD BE IMPLEMENTED ANYTIME SOON AND NOT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING TO BE OVERCOME ANY TIME AND SHE ABLE FUTURE MAYBE SOMEDAY. BUT NOT NOW. THERE'S NO WAY TO TRANSMIT SECRET BALLOT SECURELY OVER THE INTERNET. SUCH BALLOTS IN ANY CASE WOULD NOT BE EITHER MEANINGFULLY VOTER VERIFIABLE NOR AUDITABLE. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ANOTHER PROVISION OF THE BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW DISABLED VOTERS TO VOTE BY FAX UNTIL AND UNLESS AN ELECTRONIC BALLOT RETURN SYSTEM IS CERTIFIED. FAXES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE ESSENTIALLY ALL FAXES TODAY ARE TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET SO FACT VOTING IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF INTERNET VOTING. IN ADDITION FAX ITSELF AS A TECHNOLOGY IS OF SECURITY DISASTER DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM WITH EMAIL I'M AFRAID- FAXES ARE NOT END TO END ENCRYPTED CALLER ID AND PHONE NUMBERS. ARE EASILY AFFORDABLE- THE PROVISION IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR IMAGES OF VOTER SIGNATURES INSTEAD OF WET INK SIGNATURES. ALLOWS THEM TO BE FORGED SO IN SUMMARY. WE STRONGLY URGE THE CALIFORNIA NOT AUTHORIZED THE CERTIFICATION OF ANY FORM OF OUR IBM OR EXTEND FAX VOTING TO ANYONE. IN FACT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU YOU CONSIDER REMOVING ALL USE AFFECTS VOTING FROM CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS CODE. ADJOURNMENTS THANK YOU SIR.

I ALWAYS GOOD TO GO BACK TO THE HOME QUOTE FOLKS YOU KNOW. CARE UNDER YEAH I WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TALK TO CENTERS FOR ITS NEXT OR NEIGHBORS WELL- CHAU ISSUE SENATOR GLAZERS AYE AYE I KNOW YOU TO BE A- VERY DETAIL ORIENTED PERSON SO I. YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A BUNCH OF TESTIMONY AS TO THE- SECURITY OR LACK OF SECURITY AROUND. R. A. V. B. M. VOTING TO WITH THEM MISTER JEFFERSON OTHERS. SO YOU KNOW HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT AND JUST IMPORTANT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR FOR. THE OVERSEAS MILITARY. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IF ANY. ALL SIDES OF COMMON TESTIFIED BEFORE US TODAY LOOK WE- WE ALL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY IT'S A HEART AND SOUL OF- OF OUR SECRET BALLOT A PROCESS- THAT SECRETARY STATES CHARGE WITH THE INSURANCE AT THAT PROCESS TAKES PLACE APPROPRIATELY YOU KNOW THEY CERTIFY ALL THE VOTING MACHINES EVERY COUNTY- SO THERE IS THERE IS. IT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS DONE- THOUGHTFULLY AND WILL- AND- AT THIS BILL ONLY PERMITS THE SECRETARY STATE TO IF IN THE END IN THIS CASE IN HER- EXPERIENCE. AND WISDOM AND ADVICE THAT THERE IS SUCH A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE THAT. THAT THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS SO THAT'S ALL THE BILL DOES. IS GIVES US HER THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE IF THERE EVER IS IN A- SITUATION WHERE. YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS SECURE THAT SHE COULD ADVANCE THAT AND HELP. THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY HAVE ACCESS THE BALLOT WHICH IS A PART. OF OUR- HALLMARK OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS HAVING ACCESS TO FIVE. SHOWS YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE ALLOWED FOR THAT PURPOSE OF THE SECTOR STATE WOULD. WOULD VALIDATE THE SECURITY I CAN'T GO INTO EFFECT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE PLUS IS IT JUST LIKE ANY VOTING SYSTEM AND STATE TODAY. IN AND OUT OF CURIOSITY MAY I YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO INFER TO THE EXTENT THAT WE LEVERAGE OUR DOOR SORRY BUT OVERSEAS MILITARY VOTE- THE VIEWER SHOWING THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE DISPOSITIVE RIGHT THERE. IN IN THE RESULT FROM ELECTION RIGHT BECAUSE WE ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN IT'S ENTIRELY SECURE IN THE SAME WAY. SO HOW BIG IS THIS COHORT BUT PROSPECTIVELY DISABLED VOTERS A DISABILITY. SO IT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL SO CLEARLY SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME. OF A RELATIVE OF A CLOSE ELECTION INDEED BUT YET AGAIN WITH A IT TO I DON'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD TO WHAT THAT SYSTEM WOULD BE. BECAUSE I YOU KNOW THAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY QUESTION. THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE GOOD WILL AND- HAVE THOUGHTS ON PRINTS ABOUT. OUT THE SECRETARY'S OFFICE. IT COULD BE A SYSTEM THAT WHERE YOU HAVE A PAPER TRAIL AND MADE BY TERRY WILL BE PART OF WHAT. THAT TECHNOLOGY MIGHT PROVIDE IN THE YEARS AHEAD- TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A VERIFIABLE THAT. TRAIL OF ONE'S VOTE- AT EDINA SECURE WAY BUT I'M NOT GONNA JUMP AHEAD AND SAY THIS IS THE SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WE WANT TO GIVE THE SECRETARY STATE THE ABILITY TO. EXAMINE ALL THESE OPTIONS THOUGHTFULLY AS I KNOW THAT. SHE WILL AND FUTURE SECRETARY STATES WOULD AS WELL. JOINT AGED SEVENTY FAIR TO INFER FROM YOUR ANSWER THE YOU'RE YOU'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH. ANYBODY WITH AN INTEREST IN. YOU KNOW AUDITABILITY SECURITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IN FACT IS PRESENT CORRECT. IN ADDITION INDICATE INDEED THAT WE SHARE THE SAME. GOALS OF HAVING SECURE ELECTIONS. AND I THINK THAT WILL. TO WITH THEM ON. ANY KIND OF CHECKS OR BALANCES THAT THEY THINK SHOULD BE PUT IN THE BILL TO PROTECT- THE SECURITY OF THE BALLOT A VERY OPEN TO A TO WORKING WITH THEM ON. BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE ABILITY TO DO THE THOUGHTFUL REVIEW. OF ANY SYSTEM THAT COMES FOR ANY TECHNOLOGY TO SEE WHETHER IT MEETS THAT TEST. THANK YOU READY GLAD WITH THE BILL OF THE PROJECT. THEY GIVE YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HELLO LET ME HAZARD A- CONCERNS HAVE BEEN WATCHED THESE ELECTION BILLS FOR DECADES. THEY ALWAYS HAVE INTENDED OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THERE WAS RECENTLY SOME LEGISLATION TO ALLOW ASSISTANCE TO DISABLED CITIZEN. TO HELP THEM BE ABLE TO VOTE IT WAS LATER EXPANDED AND THEN. MADE OF ALMOST PERMANENT WITH COVERED NINETEEN. THAT NOTION THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY INTENDED AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RESULT IN GREATER ELECTION INTEGRITY OR PARTICIPATION. FRANKLY OVER THE DECADES IF YOU REVIEW THE VOTER PARTICIPATION WITH ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED IN THE PEOPLE AS WELL. TO ENHANCE VOTER PARTICIPATION HASN'T DONE MUCH BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A CONTINUING PROBLEM. MAYBE THOSE PROBLEMS ARE INVENTED MAYBE THEY'RE REAL BUT THAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE THAT CAN ENSUE. AND THAT IS MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. ALL THAT WOULD GIVE A CLOSE SENATORS BETTER DEALS THAT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THAT- WE ALL WON A SECRET BALLOT TO BE A PLACE AND- ACCOUNTABLE AND SAVE- IT'S THE HALLMARK OF OUR DEMOCRACY WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD AS A LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A VOTE BY MAIL. AND WE'VE ADVANCE THAT IN THERE'S ISSUES THAT HAVE COME INTO PLAY IN THAT SPACE THE SECRETARY STATUS PROVIDE STANDARDS WE ALSO WEIGH IN WITH STANDARDS I THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN IF- THEY WANT. TO GO FORWARD WITH THE POWERS THAT BE PROVIDE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THIS BILL OVER THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU. WHAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
