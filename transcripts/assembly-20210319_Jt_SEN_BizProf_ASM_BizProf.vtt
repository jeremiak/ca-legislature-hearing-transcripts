I HAVE A PRESENTATION I WILL.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.454
THANKFULLY BE BRIEF BUT SIMPLY

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.389
TO HIGHLIGHT SOME VERY

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:45.891
IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THE

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.860
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AS THE

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.495
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.530
HAVE VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.799
THAT THE PROTECTION OF

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.334
CONSUMERS IS AT THE VERY HEART.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.002
OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AT THE

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.170
MEDICAL BOARD AND AS A

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.039
REGULATOR. WHO HAS HAD

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.241
EXPERIENCE IN A VARIETY OF

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:04.176
REGULATE READ THE FARES. CAN I

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:06.478
TELL YOU THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:07.179
THAT THE MEDICAL BOARDOF

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.415
CALIFORNIA. VALUES CONSUMER

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:12.017
PROTECTION AS IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:14.420
HIGHEST PRIORITY. IN TERMS OF

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.822
AN OVERVIEW OF ENFORCEMENT. I

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.390
WELCOME THE FACT THAT TO DATE

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:19.858
WE ARE TALKING ONLY ABOUT

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:21.727
ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE AS IS

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.829
QUITE APPARENT IN FORSMAN IS

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.598
THE LARGEST FUNCTION OF THE

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.434
MEDICAL BOARD LITERALLY 80% OF

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.736
OUR RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED. TO

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.471
ENFORCEMENT SO IT'S VERY

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.407
APPROPRIATE THAT WE FOCUS ON

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:40.546
THIS VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:41.981
OUR STATUTORY MISSION. I KNOW

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.483
ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.452
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:48.621
ARE THE TIMES THAT IT TAKES TO

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.222
BRING ABOUT AN INVESTIGATION

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.124
AND TAKE A COMPLAINT THROUGH

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.526
THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE CHART

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:56.695
HERE DEMONSTRATE WHAT THOSE

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.231
TIME FRAMES ARE CHARGING OUT

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:00.899
FROM THE TIME IN WHICH ALL

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.068
INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.437
INTERNALLY IN THE BOARD- UP

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:08.307
TILL- FISCAL YEAR THIRTEEN

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:09.508
FOURTEEN AND THEN AFTER THERE

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.543
WAS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE SWORN

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.212
AND THE NON SWORN-

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.514
INVESTIGATIONS. ARE WE ARE

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.183
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASING

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.752
TIME FRAMES FROM AN

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.687
INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. I

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.422
KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:25.591
THAT MEDICAL BOARDS ALL OVER

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:27.393
THE WORLD ARE STRUGGLING WITH

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:29.194
BECAUSE CASES ARE BECOMING MORE

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:32.031
COMPLEX MORE LITIGIOUS AND

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.300
THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND ONE OF

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.634
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.003
FACE. UP TO IS THE FACT THAT

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.905
THE TIME FRAMES IN TERMS OF THE

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.907
SWORN INVESTIGATIONS HAVE

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.210
CONTINUED TO RISE DR BOTH OR-

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.779
MR PACIFICO BEFORE YOU LEAVE

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.647
THAT CHART I NORMALLY DON'T DO

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.281
THIS BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL SAVE

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.083
SOME TIME HERE. COULD YOU

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.751
EXPLAIN WHAT THAT CHART MEANS

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:55.454
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ALL CASES-

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.289
THE R. I. C. YEARS AS AN ORANGE

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.757
LINE YARNS LINE OF THOSE THE

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.826
COMPLEX CASES THOSE ARE THE

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.128
CASES THAT GO TO THE SWORN SITE

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.229
WHICH TEND TO BE THE MORE

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.699
COMPLICATED CASES. ABSOLUTELY

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.200
AND THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:12.071
IN TIME IN RECENT YEARS. THE

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.139
LESS COMPLEX CASES ON THE NON

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.576
SWORN SIDE WE HAVE MANAGED TO

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.079
MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN TERMS OF

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.313
GETTING THE TIME FRAMES DOWN.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.248

IS TIME FROM RECEIPT OF

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:32.825
COMPLAINT. TO COMPLETION OF

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:34.226
INVESTIGATION. YES THAT'S

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.695
CORRECT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS HOW

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:38.030
LONG IT TAKES TO MOVE FROM

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.798
COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION TO

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.600

THE OVERALL STATISTICS THE

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:52.738
STATISTICS FOR COMPLAINTS

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.273
RECEIVED. THIS IS A VERY

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:56.675
FAMILIAR- STATISTIC FOR THOSE

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.677
WHO FOLLOW US CLOSELY WE HAVE

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.346
BEEN RECEIVING ON THE ORDER OF

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:01.814
TEN TO ELEVEN THOUSAND

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.650
COMPLAINTS- EVERY YEAR. AND AT

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:07.119
THE END OF THE YEAR IN TERMS OF

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.754
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THERE'S A

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.923
FAIRLY LARGE CONSISTENCY THAT

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.324
WERE IN THE- THREE TO FOUR

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.861
HUNDRED- THE RATE CATEGORY. IF

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:19.965
YOU LOOK AT THAT. IN TERMS OF

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.701
THE NATIONAL CONTEXT. IT FINDS

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:23.936
OUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.604
BOARD IS IF YOU WILL SLIGHTLY

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.639
ABOVE AVERAGE IN THE TERMS OF

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.808
NUMBER OF DISCIPLINES. I CASES

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.644
PER M. D.'S- THROUGHOUT THE

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.446
STATE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.748
HERE. IS TO FOCUS ON THAT THERE

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.484
ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.052
COMPLAINTS. THAT AT A

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:41.854
RELATIVELY EARLY PART OF THE

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.791
PROCESS- ARE CLOSED OUT FOR AS

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.292
IT SAYS THEY'RE INSUFFICIENT

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.194
EVIDENCE NO VIOLATION ARE NO

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:51.296
JURISDICTION. SOMETIMES WE GET

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.364
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.665
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:55.834
INCIDENT. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.336
ONY ONE INCIDENT THERE'S

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:59.338
EFFECTIVELY ONLY WANT A

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.106
COMPLAINANT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.374
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THE

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.309
MEDICAL BOARD TO OPERATE

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.611
SOMETIMES THIS CAN SEEM A BIT

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.246
STARTLING. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:09.348
HAS WORKED IN OTHER AREAS IT'S

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:11.483
A- IT'S A FINAL IT'S A

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.385
FRAMEWORK WHICH IS ALL TOO

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:15.888
FAMILIAR. THERE ARE MANY CASES

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.891
THAT WE RECEIVED. THAT DO NOT

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.893
RAISE ISSUES OF FITNESS TO

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.661
PRACTISE AND WHAT IS NEEDED IN

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:24.897
A REGULATORY SYSTEM IS THE

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:27.199
AGILITY. TO DEAL WITH THOSE

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.902
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY SO

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:32.137
THAT ON THE LESSER NUMBER IS A

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.506
VERY SERIOUS CASES WE HAVE

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:38.777
ADEQUATE RESOURCES. TO DEAL

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.511
WITH THEM IN A COMPREHENSIVE

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.747
FASHION. WHAT I WANTED TO DO

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.081
WAS TO HIGHLIGHT WITH THE

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.616
MEDICAL BOARD SEES SAYS SOME OF

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.119
THE DRIVERS IN RELATION TO THE

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.121
TIMELINES AND RESOURCES THAT IT

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:51.290
TAKES IN ORDER TO BRING A

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.292
COMPLAINT THROUGH THE ENTIRE

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:55.994
PROCESS ONE THING WHICH IS VERY

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.030
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE OPERATE

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:00.465
UNDER A VERY HIGH BURDEN OF

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.934
PROOF IN ORDER TO GET

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.835
SUBSTANTIAL DISCIPLINE THE CASE

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.371
MUST BE PROVEN. ACCORDING TO

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.941
CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:09.575
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WERE

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:11.710
HELD O. IT BY THE

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:14.046
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND IT

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:15.814
IS A HEAVY BURDEN BUT THEN

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.583
AGAIN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.719
VERY SERIOUS SANCTION THAT'S A

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.387
VERY SERIOUS MATTER AS WELL.

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.622
THEOTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.023
EMPHASIZE IS THAT THE

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.526
LEGISLATION. REQUIRES THAT IN

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:30.462
TERMS OF FRAMING A SANCTION.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.230
YES WE LOOK AT PUBLIC

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:34.466
PROTECTION. AND THAT IS THE

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.502
PRIMARY. OBJECT THE PRIMARY

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.538
GOAL WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:42.407
BUT WE ARE ALSO DIRECTED TO

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:43.942
LOOK AT ISSUES OF

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.011
REHABILITATION AND PRACTICE

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.513
RESTRICTIONS WHICH WOULD ALLOW

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.249
A DOCTOR TO REMAIN IN PRACTICE.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.684
PROVIDED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.252
REMEDIATION OUR PRACTICE

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:56.521
RESTRICTIONS FROM SOME QUARTERS

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:58.123
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DRIVE

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.359
PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY. THAT

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.261
MOST- TIMES THERE IS A FINDING

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.696
A TRADE GROUP RESULT IN

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:07.032
REVOCATION THAT IS NOT WHAT THE

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.900
LEGISLATION DIRECTS US TO DO

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:10.836
ALTHOUGH IT DOES RECOGNIZE THAT

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:13.772
REPLICATION IS NECESSARY IN

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.108
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THE

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.743
OTHER ISSUE THAT IS A DRIVER IN

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.311
TERMS OF ENFORCEMENTIS THE

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.913
INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.882
THAT EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEMENT.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.984
CURRENTLY IS DIVIDED AMONG

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.753
THREE SEPARATE BODIES OURSELVES

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.321
THE MEDICAL BOARD THE HEALTH

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.189
QUALITY INVESTIGATIVE UNIT IN

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:33.058
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.794
THIS IS I THANK AN UNUSUAL

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.996
CONFIGURATION COMPARED TO OTHER

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:39.998
PLACES AND IT DOES PRESENT

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.667
CERTAIN CHALLENGES WHICH WE

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:44.903
WILL TALK ABOUT- THE OTHER

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.873
DRIVER- THAT WE NEED TO TALK

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.441
ABOUT IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.209
AND UNDERSTANDING WHY IT TAKES

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:53.578
SO LONG. WHAT SOMETIMES IS SO

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.814
COSTLY TO BRING A COMPLAINT ALL

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:57.683
THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS IS

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:59.184
THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW A VERY

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.687
CUMBERSOME LEGAL PROCESS WHICH

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:03.922
REQUIRES MOST CASES BEFORE ANY

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.158
SERIOUS SANCTION CAN BE.

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:08.126
CONSIDERED TO GO TO ACCUSATIONS

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.629
ACCUSATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.798
STEP IT REQUIRES THE ACTION OF

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:14.700
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.234
PREPARING A VERY LENGTHY

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:18.370
DOCUMENT WHICH IS NECESSARY BUT

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:20.338
VERY COSTLY AND VERY TIME

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:22.107
CONSUMING. WE HAVE SOMETIMES

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.342
DIFFICULTY GETTING ACCESS TO

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:26.178
THIRD PARTY RECORDS WE ALSO HAD

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:28.480
DIFFICULTIES MAINTAINING OUR

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:30.615
OBTAINING PATIENT RECORDS IN

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.050
BOTH OF THESE THINGS CAN BE

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:33.719
VERY TIME CONSUMING WHERE WE

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:36.388
WANT TO INVESTIGATE IT TAKES

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.924
SOMETIMES A LONG TIME TO

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.326
ACTUALLY GET THE RECORDS. AND

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.327
THE OTHER THING IN TERMS OF

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.896
PROCESS IS THAT UNDER OUR

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:48.200
CURRENT. STATUTE THERE ARE

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:50.102
SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS ON ANY

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:52.537
NON ADVERSARIAL OPTIONS THAT WE

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.506
MAY PURSUE. THERE IS A PUBLIC

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.841
LETTER OF REGRET RECORD

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:58.176
REPRIMAND BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE

00:22:58.243 --> 00:23:00.345
INVOKED IF IT'S AGREED BY THE

00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:02.681
OTHER PARTY AND IT'S PUBLISHED

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:03.381
IN THE MUST BE TOO SIMPLE

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:04.983
DEPARTURES. IT IS VERY

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.754
FRUSTRATING FOR US IF WE HAVE A

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.989
LENGTHY INVESTIGATION. AND IT

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.225
IS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS ONE

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.359
SIMPLE DEPARTURE IN A SIMPLE

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:17.729
DEPARTURE MAYBE SOMETHING WHICH

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:18.363
IS QUITE IMPORTANT. BUT THEN WE

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.599
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.601
REGULATE RETOOL CAT IN WHICH WE

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:25.036
CAN. BRING THE DOCTOR THROUGH

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:28.006
SOME. SOME REPEAT REMEDIATION

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.308
OUR REHABILITATION THERE'S

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.244
LITERALLY NOTHING WE CAN DO.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.745
THERE IS A REFERENCE VERY

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:36.348
BRIEFLY IN OUR STATUTE TO

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:37.849
WARNING LETTERS BUT THEIR NON

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.951
BINDING THEY'RE NOT DEFINED AND

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:41.686
THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM THAT WE

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.823
CAN RELATE RELY ON IN TERMS OF.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.459
HAVING A SERIOUS MEANS OF

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.862
DEALING WITH A COMPLAINT. SO

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.764
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FEW REFORMS

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.699
WE ARE DEDICATED TO WORKING

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.768
WITHIN THE SYSTEM TO WORKING

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.804
MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND WE

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.138
BELIEVE THAT IF THERE ARE

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.407
CERTAIN REFORMS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.376
WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.211
EFFICIENTLY WE CAN BRING THE

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.580
TIME LINES DOWN WILL HAVE MORE

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:11.516
RESOURCES. TO FOCUS ON THE VERY

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.319
SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH REQUIRE

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.421
OFTEN A VERY SERIOUS AND SEVERE

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.356
SANCTIONS. THE FIRST IS TO

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:20.158
CREATE WHAT WE HAVE DEEMED TO

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:22.427
BE A LETTER OF ADVICE WHICH

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:24.262
WOULD BE NON PUBLIC BUT

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:26.198
BINDING. THESE WOULD BE FOR

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:28.767
CASES WHERE FITNESS TO PRACTISE

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:32.237
IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT THERE IS A

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:35.373
NEED FOR REMEDIATION. WE NOTE

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.609
THAT THRE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.811
ONE OTHER BOARDS WITH THE IN

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.479
THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.582
SUCH A POWER. I KNOW THAT

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.318
INTERNATIONALLY THE REST OF THE

00:24:46.384 --> 00:24:49.120
WORLD IS MOVING TOWARDS A FOCUS

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:51.523
ON NON ADVERSARIAL MEANS OF

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.359
RESOLUTION FOR THE VAST BULK.

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.561
OFTHE COMPLAINTS AND THAT THIS

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.129
IS SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.398
NEEDED VERY MUCH AS AN OPTION

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:02.367
FOR US AT THE CALIFORNIA

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:04.669
MEDICAL. AS WE'VE ALSO STATED

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.905
IN OUR SUNSET PAPER THERE ARE A

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.440
NUMBER OF OTHER ENFORCEMENT

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:11.176
ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE THINK. ARE

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:13.411
VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY WOULD

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.313
ALLOW US TO EFFECTIVELY AND

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.315
EFFICIENTLY OBTAIN THE RECORDS

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.684
THAT ARE SO VITAL FOR US IN A

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:21.820
TIMELY MANNER. SO THAT WE CAN

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:24.222
INVESTIGATE CASES IN SO WE

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:25.657
WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME THEIR

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.792
CONSIDERATION. IN TERMS OF

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.161
INSTITUTIONAL REFORM WE THINK

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.196
THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.431
GREATER ENGAGEMENT. BETWEEN

00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:35.066
OURSELVES THE MEDICAL BOARD IN

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:35.634
THE HEALTH QUALITY

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.602
INVESTIGATIVE UNIT WE HAVE

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.971
ALREADY BEGUN TO DO THAT WE ARE

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.439
UPDATING THE MEMORANDUM OF

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.974
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.910
BODIES THERE IS GOOD WILL ON

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.145
BOTH SIDES. BOTH SIDES

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.447
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:53.285
TO- TO DEAL WITH THESE CASES

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.753
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:56.187
EFFECTIVELY AND WE ARE

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:58.023
DEDICATED TO WORKING TOGETHER

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.724
PARTICULARLY TO BRING THE TIME

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:01.826
LINES DOWN AND TO PRIORITIZE.

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.128
SO THAT WERE USING MOST

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:05.130
RESOURCES AGAINST THE MOST

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.933
IMPORTANT CASES. AND RELATED TO

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:10.001
THAT WE SEE THAT THERE WILL BE

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.970
A NEED AT SOME POINT IN THE

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.172
SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM TO BEGIN

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.840
TO CONSIDER MOVING

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.310
INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. FROM

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:20.211
THE SWORN TO THE NON SWORN SIDE

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:22.380
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SCOPE

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:25.250
AGAIN. TO RESOLVE A LOT OF THE

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:26.885
LAST SERIOUS CASES MORE

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:30.555
EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFICIENTLY IN

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:32.657
A MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER.

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.492
IN THE GOAL HERE IS AGAIN TO

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.127
FREE UP THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:38.296
NEEDED TO DEAL WITH A VERY

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:41.666
SERIOUS CASE. FINALLY I

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:43.501
UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.670
HAS SOME INTEREST. IN THE

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.505
SANCTIONING POLICY OF THE

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:49.174
MEDICAL BOARDS WE HAVE

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.409
SANCTIONING GUIDELINES AND AS

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:52.610
TO HOW THEY ARE USED TO THE

00:26:52.677 --> 00:26:55.146
CONCERN THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:56.982
NOT FOLLOWED APPROPRIATELY.

00:26:57.048 --> 00:27:02.487
WILL BE HAPPY. VOIGTS THE

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.723
GUIDELINES OUR GUIDELINES ONLY

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.691
THEY'RE MEANT THERE TO PROVIDE

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.827
GUIDANCE TO THE BOARD THEY ARE

00:27:08.893 --> 00:27:11.162
NOT MEANT TO BE FOLLOWED

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:13.631
EXACTLY IN EVERY SINGLE CASE.

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:14.599
AND MANY TIMES THE GUIDANCE

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:17.602
ITSELF IS EXPRESSED AS A

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:21.473
SPECTRUM. ARE OF A VARIETY OF

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:23.875
DIFFERENT SANCTIONS. SETTLEMENT

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:25.677
IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.445
PROCESS OF DEALING WITH

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:28.913
COMPLAINTS IT IS ACTUALLY

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.049
MANDATED THAT WE CONSIDER

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.752
SETTLEMENTS IN LAW AS PART OF

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.321
THE PROCESS. AND THAT THE

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:39.190
SETTLEMENT IS. OFTEN A VERY

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.159
ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR THE

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:43.294
MEDICAL BOARD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:46.398
US TO FULFILL. OUR MISSION OF

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:48.800
PUBLIC PROTECTION. IF WE CAN

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:52.037
IDENTIFY F. A SETTLEMENT WHICH

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:54.806
PROTECTS THE PUBLIC IT DOES SO

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.876
QUICKLY IN A COST EFFECTIVE

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:59.778
MANNER AND WITH CERTAINTY. IT

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:03.648
IS THE GUIDANCE IS. BASED ON

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:05.650
THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.385
ELEMENTS OF THE CASE HAVE BEEN

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.587
PROVEN. AND THAT THERE ARE NO

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:11.523
WITNESSES IN THE CASE IN THE

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.024
REAL WORLD AFTER AN

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:16.061
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED.

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.229
AFTER THE RESPONDENT THE

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.697
LICENSEE HAS HAD A FULL

00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:22.400
OPPORTUNITY TO STATE THEIR CASE

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.536
SOMETIMES THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.971
SO BLACK AND WHITE SOMETIMES

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.573
THE EXPERT WITNESSES ON THE

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.843
OTHER SIDE. ARE VERY PERSUASIVE

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.044
WE MUST TAKE ALL OF THAT INTO

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.180
ACCOUNT SOMETIMES WITNESSES DO

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:37.449
NOT SAY WHAT WE HAD ANTICIPATED

PEDIATRICIAN WAS A WITNESS IN

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.747
CRIMINAL CASES BUT THERE WAS

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.415
SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.765
THEN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.567
THE STATE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.569
OF SOCIAL SERVICES BAR THE

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.009
LICENSED FACILITIES. THE

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.144
NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT IT WAS

TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. TEN

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.118
YEARS LATER. THAT A MEDICAL

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:37.387
BOARD ACCUSATION WAS FILED BY

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:40.190
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SEEKING

AROUND IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN.

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.470
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:55.839
IS A LOT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.173
INVOLVED HERE WITH THE NUMBER

OF MANDATED REPORTERS OVER THAT

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.711
TEN YEAR PERIOD SO MY QUESTION

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.713
TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. IF YOU

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.515
CAN ANSWER. IS WHY IT TOOK SO

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:13.189
LONG. WELL SENATOR THE SIMPLE

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.457
ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.326
THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN ONLY

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:17.961
REACT TO THE EVIDENCE INTO THE

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.630

UP FOR INFORMATION THAT I HAD

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:29.239

COMPLAINT WAS MADE TO US AT A

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.178
MUCH SUBSEQUENT TIME THAT HE WE

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:38.114
HAD ANY BASIS TO ACT AT ALL

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:40.383

SENSE TO ME. THE MEDICAL BOARD

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.467
ITSELF CAN INITIATE A COMPLAINT

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.435
CAN YOU NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.404

TO DO SO BUT WE ARE NOT A

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.924
PRIMARY INVESTIGATIVE BODY. WE

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.859
DON'T GO OUT SEARCHING FOR

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.560
COMPLAINTS IF THINGS COME TO

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.329
OUR ATTENTION THROUGH WHATEVER

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.964
MEANS OF COURSE WE CAN FOLLOW

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:31.034
UP ON THEM. BUT LARGELY WE ARE

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.102

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.771
FOR A COMPLAINT IT WASN'T UNTIL

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:37.707
MUCH LATER IN THE PROCESS THAT

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:38.942
THE INFORMATION CAME TO OUR

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:42.378
ATTENTION WHICH ALLOWED US TO

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:43.813
ACT UPON IT. WELL I. I'LL BE

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.248
INTERESTED TO SEE THE REACTION

YOUR POWER POINT A- IS TO BE A

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:10.707
SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:13.710
INVESTIGATORS IN VARIOUS UNITS

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.545
TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND-

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.347
I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT AS

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:31.694
PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL PRACTICE

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.597
BECAUSE- SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:36.466
TEN YEAR PASSED. THE PROCESS

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.868
BROKE DOWN WHETHER IT WAS AND I

ABOUT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF-

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.410
THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO-

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.479
RECOVER INFORMATION AND TO

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:52.348
EVALUATE INFORMATION- AND TO

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.083
PROCEED WITH THAT INFORMATION

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.820
WHERE- WHERE THE FACTS. DICTATE

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.989
THAT ACTION IS APPROPRIATE. I'M

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.190
GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:03.593

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.101
QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE FIRST

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.070
QUESTION I JUST FOLLOW UP WITH.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:19.142
THE. WHAT'S CENTER ROCK PASSED-

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.410
SO JUST TO CLARIFY- MEDICAL

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.478
WARD ICE I DO UNDERSTAND IS

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:25.548
SOMETIMES CHALLENGED. IN TERMS

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.917
OF- IDENTIFYING- THE ISSUES IT

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:29.952
MAY BE GOING ON- YOU MENTIONED

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.521

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:35.391
COMPLAINTS AND UC'S MANY IS YOU

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:37.527
FELT DOCUMENTED HERE. BUT SHE

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:40.129
JUST ALSO MAYBE PERHAPS DISCUSS

INFORMATION MEDICAL BOARD GETS

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.268
THAT MIGHT TRIGGER COMPLAINTS

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:48.171
SO- I THINK- LEGAL ACTIONS

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:49.972

OTHER TYPES OF DATABASES I

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.824

PHYSICIANS OR OTHER PROVIDERS.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.968

INFORMATION TOLD VERY LATE INTO

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:02.445
THE PROCESS I GUESS THE

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.814
QUESTION IS WHAT CAUSED THAT

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.149
DELAY WAS IT BECAUSE- AND YOU

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.584

YELLOW LEGAL ACTION THAT AND-

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:13.856
SEND A REPORT OR SOMETHING BUT-

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:14.557
I THINK THAT'S- CERTAINLY

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.624
SOMETHING THAT'S THAT HIGH

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:17.259
PROFILE MURDER IT WAS A LOT OF.

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:18.627
IS IT'S INTERRUPTED LIVE

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.863
GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY. SOMEWHERE

SOMETHING YOU'D THINK WOULD

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.532
HAVE MADE ITS WAY TO THE

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:26.335
MEDICAL BOARD EARLIER- NOW THAT

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.737
IS SELL MIGHT BE. USEFUL TO

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:30.306
LOOK AT SOME OF THESE TYPES OF

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.807
CASES AND GO WELL WHAT HAPPENED

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:32.975
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.577
AND WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING THE

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.511
INFORMATION WE NEED TO SAY

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:36.712
THAT- THAT MAY BE SOMETHING WE

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:37.947
NEED TO LOOK INTO AS WELL

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:39.215
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT INVOLVES A

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.316
LICENSEE AND ITS INVOLVES

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:42.117
SOMETHING THAT'S- FAIRLY.

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.252
SERIOUS IN RELATION TO THEIR

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.955
PRACTICE OUR BEHAVIOR IN

01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:47.857
PRACTICE- WE WILL BE HAPPY TO

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.426
RESEARCH THAT. AND I WILL

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.894
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.929
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OKAY SO

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.798
THAT ALL RIGHT SO I JUST WANTED

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.099
TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND ALSO

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.801
CLARIFIED TERMS OF FOUR.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.536
DIFFERENT WHAT. WHAT SORT OF

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:01.170
ISSUES I KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.005
DOES LOOK A LOT. AT A LOT OF

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.641
DIFFERENT THINGS- LET'S SEE

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:06.175
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:06.742
SOURCES OF INFORMATION. THE

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.879
OTHER CELEBS LET'S MOVE ON- MAY

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.614
I SPEAK TO THE- SEARCH AREA

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.250
OKAY BEFORE I MOVE ON YES. THIS

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.952
IS OUR KRAUSER. UP ONE OF MY

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:19.088
FRUSTRATIONS AND SERVICE ON THE

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.257
BOARD. IS THAT GOVERNMENT

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.259
AGENCIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.227
BOARDS- WITHIN THE DCA AND

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.363
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. DON'T

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:30.699
HAVE ENOUGH COLLABORATION- SO

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:31.600
THERE'S ALSO A SEMANTIC ISSUE

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.636
HERE- WHEN WE SPEAK OF

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.171
COMPLAINT. WE'RE NOT MEANING TO

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.674
SAY THAT MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:41.243
NEEDS TO FILL OUT A REPORT AND

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.379
MAKE A COMPLAINT. A COMPLAINT

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:44.113
IS SOMETHING THAT WE BECOME

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:46.649
AWARE OF WHAT WE ALSO READ THE

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.984
NEWSPAPER AND BECOME AWARE OF

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.719
THINGS THAT THE NEWSPAPER. OVER

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.454
THE YEARS- APART READING AN

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:53.722
ARTICLE IN THE NEWSPAPER I

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:56.158
SOMETIMES WILL CALL CALL THE-

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:57.793
THE BOARD DIRECTOR AND SAY WHAT

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.795
ABOUT THIS AND GENERALLY BY THE

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:00.729
TIME I BECOME AWARE OF

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:03.699
SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER THE

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:04.366
BOARDS ALREADY INVESTIGATING IT.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.936
HI SIMILARLY- THERE WAS A

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.405
RECENT CASE WHERE. THE MEDICAL

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.774
BOARD WAS INVESTIGATING A

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.276
COMPLAINT- AND THE L. A. TIMES

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.778
WROTE AN ARTICLE THAT THEY

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:16.745
CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.514
HEALTH. BECAUSE THERE SEEM THAT

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.316
THEIR CALLS ALSO COULD HAVE

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.651
BEEN A FAILURE TO REPORT- ON

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.386
THE PART OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.088
HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND THE

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.089
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:29.258
SAID WELL WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.826
OF THIS. JONES SO SINCE THAT

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:31.994
TIME I KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.263
BOARD HAS REACHED OUT TO ALL

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.932
ASSOCIATED ORGANIZATIONS. I AND

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.934
THIS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.303
SUCH THAT WE CAN. LET ONE

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.238
ANOTHER KNOW WHEN WE BECOME

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:44.873
AWARE OF AN ISSUE. THAT MAY

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.176
REACH ACROSS MULTIPLE BOARDS OR

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:50.079
MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. REGARDING

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:53.449
THIS SPECIFIC CASE- A PEDOPHILE

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:56.018
YEAH IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WOULD

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.786
ASSUME THAT THE BOARD BEGAN

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.588
INVESTIGATING AND WHEN THE

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.590
BOARD BECAME AWARE OF IT. SO IT

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.192
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO VIEW THIS

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.628
AS A SENTINEL CASE. AND TO LOOK

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.229
OVER ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:10.032
AGENCIES THAT INVESTIGATED THAT

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.801
CASE AND VIEWED THE CASE AND

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.069
FIND OUT. WHY THAT HAD NOT BEEN

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.304
REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:17.006
SOONER. SO ONE OF THE THINGS

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:18.540
THAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD COME

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:21.076
OUT OF ISSUES SUCH AS THIS.

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.845
WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.447
HELP US IN ASSURING THAT WE

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.316
HAVE A GREATER COLLABORATION-

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.585
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.285
AND GREATER SHARING OF

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.121
INFORMATION. SO THAT THINGS

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:33.422
DON'T FALL BY THE BY THE

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.024
WAYSIDE. BUT AGAIN

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.326
SEMANTICALLY. A COMPLAINT BY

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:41.397

DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS SO THAT IS

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:54.376
SOMETHING THAT WE CALL A

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:57.713

ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD BE

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.752

SURE HI THIS IS SAID DR CROSS

01:30:57.685 --> 01:31:05.793
AGAIN- IF I MADE- HAVE THE

PRIVILEGE OF INTERPRETING AGAIN

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:10.531
SEMANTICALLY WHAT WE MEAN BY

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:15.536
REACTOR VERSUS A PROACTIVE- WE

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.338
HAVE TO HAVE INFORMATION TO

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.841
REACT TO. BUT AGAIN WE DON'T

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.542
REQUIRE SOMEONE TO SEND IN A

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.544

WHAT I DID THIS AND- YOU KNOW

DID YOU READ THE NEWSPAPER- SO

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:36.023
A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE DOES COME

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.359
TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION. BUT

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:39.861
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE STAFF

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.696
THAT THE RESET EVERY NEWSPAPER

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:42.630
SO THERE COULD BE SOME

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.565
ARTICLES- THAT THEY DON'T COME

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.834
TO OUR ATTENTION. I AS I SAID

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:48.369
EARLIER GENERALLY BY THE TIME I

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:49.637
READ SOMETHING IN THE PAPER THE

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:54.108
BOARDS ALREADY. WORKING ON IT-

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.776
WHAT IS MEANT WHEN WE SAY WE'RE

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:58.179
NOT PROACTIVE. IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.814
A STAFF OF A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:02.316
WERE HANGING OUT HOSPITAL LOW

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:04.352
LOUNGES AND STREET CORNERS

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:06.554
OVERHEARING CONVERSATIONS TO

01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:08.823
PICK UP ON CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:12.026
IN SOMEBODY MAY BE MISBEHAVING.

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:14.028
WHAT WE NEVER DID MORE

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:17.899
INFORMATION- WE NEVER IGNORE

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.767
CONCERNS VIDAK READ OF SOMEONE

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.435
WHO MAY BE MISBEHAVING IN A

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:24.238
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. LET'S NOT DO

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:25.339
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT UNTIL

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:26.741
SOMEONE SENDS IN A COMPLAINT TO

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:28.409
THE MEDICAL BOARD SO I DON'T

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:31.212
WANT THAT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:35.016
WE'RE PROACTIVE. ONCE WE HAVE

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:37.718
INFORMATION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.620
A CADRE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.322
IN THE WOODS- AND IN THE

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.957
STREETS SO TO SPEAK-

OVERHEARING CONVERSATIONS TO

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:47.161

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.829
THAT WE'RE GETTING HUNG UP ON

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.132

AND TO SEE WHERE IN THE- CHAIN

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:04.045
OF EVENTS. THERE WAS A FAILURE

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:07.014
TO NOTIFY THE MEDICAL BOARD BY

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:08.916
ONE AGENCY OR ANOTHER AGENCY.

THIS TITLE RETREATS AFTER

THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION IT

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:18.813

GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO PROVIDED

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:25.119
THE- AT THE INFORMATION AND THE

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:26.821
EXPERTISE TO BRING IT TO THE

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:31.058
ACCUSATION LEVEL. SO THE SO THE

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:33.027
ACTION THAT WE TOOK. WAS DONE

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:34.995
AT THE EARLIEST STAGE THAT WE

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:40.401
HAD THE INFORMATION TO ACT UPON.

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:41.001
IS IT IS THIS A FAILURE OF THE

AS WE HAVE SAID THAT THE

GUIDANCE IS THERE TO PROVIDE

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.363
GUIDANCE SETTLEMENTS ARE DONE

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.498
IN THE CONTEXT OF EACH

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:06.600
INDIVIDUAL CASE LOOKING AT ALL

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.702
OF THE RELEVANT FACTS WE LOOK

01:45:08.769 --> 01:45:10.437
AT. THAT WE BEGIN WITH THE

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:12.506
ACCUSATION WE LOOK AT THE

01:45:12.572 --> 01:45:13.974
EXPERT REPORTS THERE MAY BE

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.909
CONTRARY EXPERT REPORTS WE LOOK

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:18.278
AT THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:19.946
WE ALWAYS HAVE A VIEW AS TO

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.548
WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:23.050
GOING TO BE IF THERE IS NO

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.751
SETTLEMENT AND IF THE CASE GOES

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.253
TO HEARING. WE OBVIOUSLY LOOK

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:27.621
AT THE OUTCOME WHICH WE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.389
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CASE WAS A

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:31.558
VERY SERIOUS. INVOLVING THE

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.927
DEATH OF THE PATIENT BUT THE

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:35.962
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO FACE UP

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:37.764
TO IS RELATED TO THE STANDARD

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:39.666
OF CARE WHICH CANNOT BE DRIVEN

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:42.035
EXCLUSIVELY BY THE OUTCOME. YOU

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:45.005
CAN HAVE A VERY A POOR OUTCOME

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:46.540
AND THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:48.642
THE STANDARD OF CARE YOU COULD

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.677
HAVE A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME. IN

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:52.245
THERE IS AN EXTREME DEPARTURE

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.880
FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE IT'S

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.649
THE STANDARD OF CARE AND THE

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.951
QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE THAT

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.053
RELATES TO DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.922
MADE. ON THE BASIS OF

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:03.990
SETTLEMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ARE

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.726
DRIVEN BY WHAT WE CONSIDER TO

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:07.828
BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:09.896
THE CONTEXT OF EACH CASE. THERE

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:12.099
MAY BE A VIEW TAKEN THAT THE

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.501
SETTLEMENT ACHIEVED IS BETTER

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:19.272
THAN IS LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED.

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:19.806
IF THE CASE WERE TO GO TO

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.241
HEARING. BOB ASKED THE QUESTION

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:22.776
ABOUT THE MONITORING OF

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.089
CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET. THEN

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.492
THAT'S THE BAND THERE THEN THE

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:28.295
ARM. ARE THE LICENSEE IS

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:31.898
ELIGIBLE TO COME OFF PROBATION

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:32.465
AND SO IT'S ALL DONE IN THAT

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:36.036
CONTEXT. SO THEN. I MEAN I

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:38.204
CERTAINLY- WANT TO KIND OF

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:40.240
DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THAT

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:43.610
I MEAN WHO WHO'S INVOLVED IN

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:46.680
THE AND- THE ASSESSMENT. OF

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:51.618
WHETHER- WHETHER A SETTLEMENT

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:54.554
SHOULD BE- DIFFERENT FROM THE

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:56.523
GUIDELINES- IF THE GUIDELINES

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:58.258
ARE THERE TO BE GUIDANCE IS AND

01:49:58.325 --> 01:49:59.893
THE DECISION IS TO BE MADE TO

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.530
DO SOMETHING THAT IS. NOT TO

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:04.030
THE SAME LEVEL AS WHAT'S

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:06.166
RECOMMENDED. I'M I'M I'M

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.368
STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.303
THAT HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE WHAT'S

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:11.304
THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:13.440
GUIDELINES IF YOU'RE GOING TO

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:15.241
COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:17.077
NOT TO THAT LEVEL. OKAY IT'S

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:18.645
VERY SIMPLE THE GUIDELINES ARE

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:20.447
BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION. THAT

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.248
ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CASE HAVE

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.984
BEEN PROVEN TO A CLEAR AND

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.852
CONVINCING STANDARD. THERE

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:27.687
BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.723
THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL FACTORS

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:31.091
OF MEDICATIONS THAT ARE

01:50:31.157 --> 01:50:32.759
NECESSARY TO BE TAKEN INTO

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:34.894
ACCOUNT. A SO ALL OF THOSE

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.463
THINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO

01:50:36.529 --> 01:50:39.265
ACCOUNT. THE PROCESS BY WHICH A

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:41.634
SETTLEMENT IS ENTERED INTO. IS

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:44.304
THAT THE INITIAL AGREEMENT TO

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:46.039
PROPOSE A SETTLEMENT IS A

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.774
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:49.542

DIRECTOR AND THE HEAD OF

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:57.283
ENFORCEMENT AT THAT POINT THEN.

01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:58.651
IF WE AGREE WITH THE

01:50:58.718 --> 01:51:00.053
RECOMMENDATION ARE WE FASHION A

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.522
NEW RECOMMENDATION. IT IS GOES

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:04.290
INTO SETTLEMENT THERE MAY OR

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.026
MAY NOT BE IN AGREEMENT IF

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.560
THERE IS AN AGREEMENT. THAT

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:10.463
ULTIMATELY THAT GOES FOR REVIEW

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.665
BEFORE ONE OF THE PANELS AND

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:15.602
THE PANEL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:51:15.668 --> 01:51:17.570
TO OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT ARE

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.639
TO QUESTION AT. OUR END WHICH

01:51:19.706 --> 01:51:21.875

TO EXPLAIN VARIOUS FACTORS THAT

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:32.185
WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AND

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:32.952
THEN THE PANEL HAS THE ABILITY.

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:34.521
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:35.522
BELLETTI TO REJECT THE

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:37.057
SETTLEMENT SO THAT'S IF YOU

AMONGST. ON THE BOARD AND THE

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.216

EXECUTIVE BY THE ATTORNEY

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:16.062
GENERAL. AND THEN THAT IS-

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.997
THAT'S A MATTER OF DISCUSSION.

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:19.666
SOMETIMES WE ACCEPTED SOMETIMES

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.534

LEVEL OF SOME OF- A SEVERITY.

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.641
THAT'S THE INITIAL POINT BET

01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:29.409
NOW THERE IS NO SETTLEMENT

01:52:29.476 --> 01:52:30.777

POINT. MAYBE NOT HERE BUT- M.

01:53:14.187 --> 01:53:16.022
HOW HOW MANY TIMES IS IT

NORMALLY ACCEPTED THE

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:19.292
RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT

ADVERSITY IS IT BEING. CHANGED

01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:25.165
REJECTED OR OR IS THAT JUST AN

01:53:25.231 --> 01:53:26.332
ONGOING THING. WELL FIRST OF

ALL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

01:53:28.601 --> 01:53:29.969
THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.771
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:33.239
AND HAVE A VERY LENGTHY

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.241
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WE'VE

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.643
BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.478
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.647
THEY KNOW WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:42.615
IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:43.550
AND THEY REALLY HAVE

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:45.285
INTERNALIZED A LOT OF THAT. IN

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:47.153
TERMS OF THEIR OWN WORK. SO BY

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:48.021
AND LARGE WE GET

01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:49.889
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THEM FIRST

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:51.691
OF ALL WE ALWAYS FIND THAT THEY

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:53.526
ARE VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER.

01:53:53.593 --> 01:53:56.796
THAT THEY ARE DESERVING OF. OUR

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:59.132
CAREFUL ANALYSIS- WE WOULDN'T

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:01.267
REJECT THEM LIGHTLY BUT THE

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:02.835
MEDICAL BOARD IN THE EXECUTIVES

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:04.604
WE HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:05.138
VIEW WE HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.373
EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE DIFFERENT

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.875
VIEWS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:09.943
CASES AND THERE'S A VERY

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:12.078
CONSTRUCTIVE. GIVE AND TAKE

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:13.479
BETWEEN US AT THE END OF THE

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:15.882
DAY THE DECISION IS WITH THE

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:18.117
BOARD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS.

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.819
OUR ADVISER WE ARE THE CLIENT

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:20.887
BUT WE FIND THAT THEY WERE

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:21.955
ADVISED IT'S VERY GOOD IT'S

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:23.356
ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:25.058
INTO ACCOUNT. AND THE ONE THING

01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:26.359
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.294
OFFICE HAS IS VERY FLUID

01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:30.797
INTELLIGENCE AND EXPERIENCE.

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:32.165
DEALING WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:34.100
LAW JUDGES SO THEY HAVE A VERY

01:54:34.167 --> 01:54:35.468
GOOD INTELLIGENCE ABOUT WHAT'S

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.270
THE LIKELY. OUTCOME GOING TO BE

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:41.007
A HEARING WHICH IS VERY POOR.

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:43.710
OKAY BUT INTERESTED I JUST WANT

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:46.045
TO EMPHASIZE IS. THAT IT IT

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.513
STATED IN THE CO LIKE A PART.

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.581
OF PUBLIC HEALTH BE THE HIGH

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:50.516
PRIORITY SO YEAH UP IN THE-

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:54.020
DECISION. THAT IS THAT. IS THAT

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.955
IS THE GOAL- I ABSOLUTELY WE

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:58.458
DON'T AGREE ANY SETTLEMENT THAT

01:54:58.524 --> 01:54:59.092
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S IN THE

01:54:59.158 --> 01:55:02.695
PUBLIC INTEREST. FULL STOP. BOB

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:04.497
NOW IS A VERY RECENT CASE I

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:05.198
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.367
DETAILS OF IT. BUT THERE WAS A

01:55:07.433 --> 01:55:08.968
RECOMMENDATION THAT IT SHOULD

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:11.204
GO TO SETTLEMENT. AT THE VIEW

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:12.939
WAS ARE THAT THE THAT THERE WAS

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.440
A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL AND WE

01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:16.609
SAID NO SIMPLY BECAUSE- WITHOUT

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:18.211
IT YOU GO TO A HEARING THERE

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:20.880
WAS A CONFLICT THE FACT. NOW IT

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:23.216
IS NOT CLEAR. HOW THAT WILL BE

01:55:23.283 --> 01:55:25.051
RESOLVED. ALL THESE CASES ARE

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:27.020
BLACK AND WHITE. BUT I

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.221
CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:30.490
A SIGNIFICANT CON. CONFLICT THE

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:32.525
FACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT'S

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:34.060
WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A HEARING.

01:55:34.127 --> 01:55:36.729
BECAUSE LET THE FACT FINDER

01:55:36.796 --> 01:55:37.997
MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:39.565
CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:40.500
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:42.335
CAN'T DO JUST ON THE BASIS OF A

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:44.771
PAPER SETTLEMENT. SO WE HAVE

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:46.472
DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS BUT

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.374
THAT'S A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.576
THANK. WE GET GOOD ADVICE WE

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:52.078
RESPECT THE ADVICE BUT AT THE

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:53.012
END OF THE DAY THE MEDICAL

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:54.947
BOARD MAKES THE DECISION. AND

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.482
AGAIN WE DON'T RECOMMEND ANY

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:58.384
SETTLEMENT UNLESS IT'S IN THE

01:55:58.451 --> 01:56:00.787
PUBLIC INTEREST. DO YOU AND I

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.255
KNOW THAT I NOTED I KNOW TO

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:03.756
NOTICE THAT YOU HAD A NUMBER OF

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.925
REFORMS- IN YOUR POWERPOINT

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:08.294
PRESENTATION. AND ARE THERE

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.096
ADDITIONAL REFORMS TO THE

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.131
SETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT THAT

01:56:12.198 --> 01:56:14.767
WOULD IMPROVE. PATIENT

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:17.403
PROTECTION DO YOU SEE- AND ANY

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:19.005
ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT NEED TO

SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT

NEGLIGENCE. THESE ARE AN UP AND

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:37.557
OF COURSE THE RESULT OF

01:56:37.623 --> 01:56:40.593
WRONGFUL DEATH IS TRAGIC AND-

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.029
OTHER REFORMS THAT CAN BE DONE

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:44.931
TO IMPROVE. THIS PROCESS OKAY

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:46.165
WELL FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE NOT

THE CURRENT SUNSET PROPOSAL.

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:52.505
BUT I CAN CERTAINLY ASSURE YOU.

01:56:52.572 --> 01:56:54.407
THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:57.877
AREA. AND THAT WE ARE. WILLING

THE PROCESS. OUT WE THINK IT'S

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.486
VERY IMPORTANT. AGAIN THE

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:08.388
SETTLEMENTS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:10.957
FOR US OF CERTAINTY. AND THAT

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.159
WE KNOW WE ARE GOING TO GET. A

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:14.827
SOLUTION WHICH PROTECTS THE

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.763
PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT'S

01:57:16.829 --> 01:57:17.864
SOMETHING WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.499
THE ABSENCE OF SETTLEMENTS AND

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.100

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:25.471
IMPROVEMENTS OF THE PROCESS BUT

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:31.811
NONE OF THOSE ARE PART. OF OUR

01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:32.712
CURRENT SUNSET PROPOSED. AND I

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:33.713

YOU WANT ASK THIS QUESTION WHEN

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:36.849
IT TO PROVIDE- IS THAT NORMALLY

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.718
DOES THAT NORMALLY LIMIT A

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.420
POSITION THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE.

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:43.689
IS THAT OR IS THAT PART OF. THE

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.258
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS WELL.

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:47.026
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS LIMIT THE

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:49.595
SCOPE OF PRACTICE. OF MANY

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:51.197
TIMES THERE ARE CONDITIONS THAT

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.965

01:57:58.037 --> 01:57:59.806
LIMITATIONS ON PRACTICE

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:01.474

ON SOLO PRACTICE- THERE'S

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:05.645
REQUIRING A PRACTICE MONITOR

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:07.013

LICENSES WITH DISCIPLINARY

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:38.343
ACTION- WITH NO PUBLIC DOCUMENT

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:42.047
THERE'S- ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:13:58.397 --> 02:14:00.966
THE FACT. AND I THINK YOU

02:14:07.873 --> 02:14:09.674
ACTION AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S

02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:10.642
THE CASE AND SO THAT'S WHY I

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:13.712

HAVE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM-

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:25.657
BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A

02:14:25.724 --> 02:14:28.059
LOT OF. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

02:14:28.126 --> 02:14:30.929

DONE AS PART OF THE LEGAL

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:37.696
PROCESS IN THE ACCUSATION STAGE

02:15:37.762 --> 02:15:39.898

OPTIONS IS REVOCATION. BUT THAT

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:02.254
DOES NOT MEAN THAT THAT WILL

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:05.056
ULTIMATELY BE THE APPROPRIATE

02:16:05.123 --> 02:16:15.333

THERE'S SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY

PEOPLE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:21:13.898 --> 02:21:14.933
OF THOUGHT IS AN ANOMALY IN THE

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:17.001
ACT. BASICALLY THE COMPLAINANT

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:19.270
IS THE MEDICAL BOARD- THE

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:21.539
DOCTOR IS THE RESPONSE THAT IF

THE DOCTORS ARE HAPPY WITH THE

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:24.576
OUTCOME THERE IS NO RIGHT OF

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.344
APPEAL THERE'S NO SUCH RIGHT OF

PARTICULARLY ON THE BASIS THAT

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:43.461
THERE THAT THE SANCTION IS NOT

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:46.064
SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT THE

02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.665

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.802
SPECIFICALLY ON ENFORCEMENT AND

02:22:57.869 --> 02:22:59.470
SO IN REFERENCE TO YOUR POWER

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:03.775

ABOUT FORMS REQUIRED AND FIRST

02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:09.047
A STATEMENT AND THAT IS

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.282
ASSEMBLY THIS THAT HAVING HEARD

THE TESTIMONY AND THE BACK AND

02:23:13.151 --> 02:23:14.986
FORTH ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE NEWS

02:23:15.053 --> 02:23:18.356
ARTICLE- I NOW SEE THE FIRST

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:19.757
BULLET POINT AS CLOSER

02:23:19.824 --> 02:23:22.927
ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN NBC. AND THE

02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:25.697

EVEN PROBABLY INCLUDE THE-

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.440
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:23:35.506 --> 02:23:37.508
AS FAR AS CLOSER ENGAGEMENT MY

02:23:37.575 --> 02:23:39.210
QUESTION IS- THE SECOND

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:41.379
BALANCES INCREASED FLEXIBILITY

02:23:41.446 --> 02:23:42.180
TO MOVE INVESTIGATIVE

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:44.449
RESOURCES. FROM SWORN TO NON

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:48.786
SWORN STAFF- WHAT WOULD BE. THE

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:51.055
BENEFIT FOR THE IMPROVEMENT

02:23:51.122 --> 02:23:52.857
THAT THE BOARD IS EXPECTING OR

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:54.592
LOOKING FOR FROM HAVING

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:57.328
INCREASE FLEXIBILITY AND WHAT

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:59.297
EXACTLY DOES IN FLEET THE

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:02.834
INCREASE FLEXIBILITY. AND

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:04.669
RESOURCES OF MEAN. YEAH I WILL

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:06.304
BE HAPPY TO BEGIN THE ANSWER TO

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:08.006
THAT QUESTION- THERE IS A

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:10.842
CONCERN THAT WE'RE HAVING.

02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:12.910
SWORN OFFICERS IN TOO MANY

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.912
CASES TO DO WORK THAT COULD BE

02:24:14.979 --> 02:24:17.615
DONE BY NON SWORN OFFICERS. THE

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:19.450
EFFECT OF THIS IS THE DIRECT

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:22.420
EFFECT ON COST AND ON TIME. SO

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:23.788
WE'RE LOOKING TO BE AS

02:24:23.855 --> 02:24:26.190
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AS THIS

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.358
IS IN THE BACKDROP OF THE

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:29.627
MEDICAL BOARD THAT HAS IT-

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.863
LOOMING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. SO

02:24:31.929 --> 02:24:33.664
WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THIS IS

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:35.133
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN A NUMBER

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:37.668
OF AREAS. IS TO DEAL WITH EACH

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:40.171
CASE APPROPRIATELY WE BELIEVE

02:24:40.238 --> 02:24:41.773
HAT MORE CASES CAN BE DEALT

02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:43.674
WITH IN A NON ADVERSARIAL

02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:45.810
FASHION. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY

02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:47.345
CAN BE SETTLED AT AN EARLIER

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:50.281
STAGE AND- REMEDIATION CAN BE

02:24:50.348 --> 02:24:52.650
INITIATED FASTER AND IN MORE

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:55.386
CASES. SIMILARLY WE BELIEVE

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:56.487
THAT THERE ARE MANY OF THE

02:24:56.554 --> 02:24:58.456
ADVERSARIAL CASES THAT CAN BE

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:00.691
RESOLVED BY NON SWORN.

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:03.961
PERSONNEL FASTER AND IN A MORE

02:25:04.028 --> 02:25:06.130
<u>&lt;c.blue&gt;FFICIENT WAY. AND AT THE END&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:08.466
OF THE DAY THE GOAL HERE IS TO

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.401
FREE UP RESOURCES FOR THE VERY

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:11.803
DIFFICULT CASES THE VERY

02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:14.338
SERIOUS CASES. MANY OF WHICH

02:25:14.405 --> 02:25:15.540
CAN BE QUITE COMPLICATED

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.408
WITCHER VERY STRENUOUSLY

02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:19.811
CONTESTED AND WE NEED TO HAVE

02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:21.879
MORE RESOURCES FOR THOSE SO

02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:26.017
THAT'S. THE GOAL IN ALL OF

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.652
THESE REFORMS. FOR THANK YOU

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:30.822
ROOM GRAYSON DUCT FAN. I THANK

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:32.423
YOU AS CHAIRMAN OF- FREESHEET

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:33.624
THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO ASK A

02:25:33.691 --> 02:25:34.959
COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS RELATED

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:36.394
TO ENFORCEMENT- FIRST QUESTION

02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:38.329
ACTUALLY SOLD A FOLLOW UP FROM

02:25:38.396 --> 02:25:40.832
A SERVER TIED UP SO- CERTAINLY-

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.667
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:45.803
PHYSICIAN WHO IS FOUND TO BE-

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.039
DECISION OR NEGLIGENT- WHICH IS

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:50.174
A PLACED ON PROBATION AND THEIR

02:25:50.241 --> 02:25:50.608
PRACTICE NEEDS TO BE

02:25:50.675 --> 02:25:53.244
SUPERVISED. NOW I KNOW IN ONE

02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.880
CASE OF A PHYSICIAN WHO-

02:25:55.947 --> 02:25:57.181
BASICALLY CHAU POOR

02:25:57.248 --> 02:25:59.984
DOCUMENTATION ALSO HAD A RECORD

02:26:00.051 --> 02:26:02.153
OF- READY INAPPROPRIATE

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.021
EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINATIONS

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:05.490
THAT- PART OF THE BOARD'S

02:26:05.556 --> 02:26:08.826
DISCIPLINE INCLUDED A- AT THE

02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:11.562
PROVISION INCLUDED SUPERVISION.

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:13.197
BY ANOTHER PHYSICIAN BUT

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:14.899
INTERESTING ENOUGH HE GOT TO

02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:15.900
SELECT A POSITION HE WAS

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:17.401
SUPERVISING HIM DURING HIS

02:26:17.468 --> 02:26:20.605
PROBATION IS THAT NORMAL COURSE

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:23.074
FOR THE BOARD I FIND THAT- WHY

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.308
WOULD THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:26.711
COMMITTED THE VIOLATION YOU GET

02:26:26.777 --> 02:26:27.645
TO PICK THE PERSON WHO GETS TO

02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:32.450
WATCH. THIS PERFORMANCE. GOING

02:26:32.517 --> 02:26:35.186
TO THE FUTURE DURING PROBATION-

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:37.855
SENATOR PAM I BELIEVE THAT WHAT

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:41.926
HAPPENS IS THEY PRESENTS THE

02:26:41.993 --> 02:26:45.029
LICENSEE PRESENTS. OPTIONS TO

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:48.633
THE PRACTICE MANAGER- I'M SORRY

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:51.435
TO THE PROBATION MONITOR- AND

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:57.208
IT SAY. PROCESS. THAT THEY HAVE

02:26:57.275 --> 02:26:58.743
TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:02.079
EVALUATION AND- UNDERSTANDING-

02:27:02.146 --> 02:27:04.015
THEY CAN'T BE THEY CAN'T WORK

02:27:04.081 --> 02:27:06.184
WITH THEM THEY CAN'T BE RELATED

02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:09.153
TO- IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT AN

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:11.689
ARM'S LENGTH- WELL THAT THAT

02:27:11.756 --> 02:27:12.623
WASN'T CERTAINLY INDICATING THE

02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:14.458
DOCUMENTATION I THINK IT'S

02:27:14.525 --> 02:27:16.394
APROPOS TO SEND HER TARDIS

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:18.196
QUESTION. SHOULDN'T THE MEDICAL

02:27:18.262 --> 02:27:19.730
BOARD ITSELF TAKE ON

02:27:19.797 --> 02:27:21.199
RESPONSIBILITY PERHAPS WORKING

02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:23.467
WITH LOCAL PROFESSIONALS SIZE

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:24.001
SUPPORT AND THEN A FINE

02:27:24.068 --> 02:27:26.037
INDEPENDENT MONITOR INSTEAD OF

02:27:26.103 --> 02:27:27.705
RELYING ON THE VERY PHYSICIAN

02:27:27.772 --> 02:27:31.075
HE'S BEING PUT ON PROBATION TO

02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:34.879
IDENTIFY THEIR OWN MONITOR. YES

02:27:34.946 --> 02:27:37.248
I WILL- I AGREE WITH YOU AND I

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.616
WILL CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT I

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:39.217
MEAN I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:40.451
THEY HAVE TO BE OBSOLETE EXCEPT

02:27:40.518 --> 02:27:41.886
YOU'RE ASKING THE VERY PERSONS

02:27:41.953 --> 02:27:43.054
BEING PUNISHED TO IDENTIFY

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.889
SOME. INITIAL CANDIDATES THAT'S

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:46.290
NOT ARMS LIKE THAT POINT AS

02:27:46.357 --> 02:27:47.425
SOON AS THEY'RE INVOLVED IT'S

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:49.293
NOT ARMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. NO

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:50.695
MATTER WHO THEY BECAUSE THERE'S

02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:51.629
YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T THINK

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:52.496
THAT PERSON'S EXACTLY AN

02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:54.465
OBJECTIVE PERSON TO ADD BE

02:27:54.532 --> 02:27:57.868
ASKING. WHO SHOULD MONITOR

02:27:57.935 --> 02:28:00.004
THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES. OKAY

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:00.938
I'M GLAD WE HAVE AGREEMENT

02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:02.707
HERE- THE SECOND ONE ACTUALLY

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:03.908
IN THE SAME CASE IS INTERESTING

02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:05.743
THAT- YOU KNOW THERE WERE

02:28:05.810 --> 02:28:08.045
SEVERAL AGAIN APPRECIATE- AND

02:28:08.112 --> 02:28:10.648
THIS. THE YOU KNOW SEVERAL

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:11.916
STEPS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD

02:28:11.983 --> 02:28:13.818
DID TAKE BUT ONE THE FASTENING

02:28:13.884 --> 02:28:16.287
PARTS THOUGH WAS IS THAT- YOU

02:28:16.354 --> 02:28:18.055
KNOW. THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.890
THAT LED TO HIS. HIS BEING

02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:21.359
SANCTIONED WAS NOT ACTUALLY

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:23.995
PROHIBITED FOR HIM DOING IN THE

02:28:24.061 --> 02:28:25.563
FUTURE. SO IT WASN'T BANNED

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:26.530
FROM WRITING FOR THEIR MEDICAL

02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:28.733
EXEMPTIONS NOW SUBSEQUENT LAW

02:28:28.799 --> 02:28:29.834
HAS CHANGED THAT CIRCUMSTANCES

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.536
BUT- SHOULDN'T THE PERSON WHO.

02:28:32.603 --> 02:28:35.773
IS DEFICIENT. IN THE AREA THAT

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.775
THEY WERE ARE BEING. RELATIONS

02:28:37.842 --> 02:28:38.342
SHOULD THERE BE SOME

02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:40.344
CIRCUMSTANCES SOME CITY YOU

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:42.280
KNOW SHOULDN'T BE SANCTIONED

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:44.482
ALSO INVOLVE AT LEAST CERTAINLY

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:46.517
IF IT'S NOT. ESSENTIAL TO THEIR

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:48.919
PATIENT CARE DUTIES- NOT

02:28:48.986 --> 02:28:50.321
ENGAGING IN THE VERY BEHAVIOR

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:52.590
THAT TRIGGERED THE REASON THAT

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:53.424
THEY'RE BEING PLACED ON.

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:55.493
PROBATION ARE THE OBVIOUS HERE

02:28:55.559 --> 02:28:57.595
LET'S BY SUSPEND THEY CAN'T BUT

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:58.396
THEY BEING PLACED ON PROBATION

02:28:58.462 --> 02:29:01.265
SHOULD THAT BE ALWAYS INCLUDED

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:01.832
IN THE US SANCTIONS FOR THE

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:05.403
POSITION. CERTIFICATION IF I

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:07.705
COULD INTERJECT HERE ALL OF

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:10.508
THESE SETTLEMENTS AND SANCTIONS

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:13.044
ARE VERY MUCH HE SPOKE THE RISE

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.412
OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF

02:29:14.478 --> 02:29:17.181
EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE IT MAY BE

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:19.283
THE CASE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF

02:29:19.350 --> 02:29:21.352
CASES THAT THERE IS A IT'S

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.153
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:24.755
PROHIBITION ORDER IN RELATION

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.557
TO THE CONDUCT UNDER QUESTION

02:29:26.624 --> 02:29:28.559
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:30.261
IN EVERY CASE IN FACT I WOULD

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:31.929
THINK PROHIBITION SOME PRACTICE

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:33.964
OR SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BE

02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:35.533
MORE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:37.234
THE RULE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE

02:29:37.301 --> 02:29:39.136
FACTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE.

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:40.838
WE WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT IN

02:29:40.905 --> 02:29:42.139
THE ANY MORE DETAIL THAT IN THE

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.308
INDIVIDUAL CASE BUT JUST TO SAY

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:46.977
THAT THE SANCTIONS THEY ARE

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:48.879
MEANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC TO

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:49.980
THE FACT THAT WELL IN THE SOME

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:50.881
OF THE SAME WAY- DAHLE GO

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:53.250
ACROSS TO THE SAME FORMULA OKAY

02:29:53.317 --> 02:29:54.919
WELL I UNDERSTAND THERE'S IN

02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:55.953
THE FORMULA BUT LET'S PUT IT

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:57.588
THIS WAY IF FURTHER SANCTION

02:29:57.655 --> 02:30:00.291
HAS TO DEAL WITH THEIR- ABUSE

02:30:00.358 --> 02:30:01.926
OF THEIR AUTHORITY THE LICENSE

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:04.128
AUTHORITY- THAT HAS AN IMPACT

02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:06.831
ON PUBLIC HEALTH RADIOWORKS

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:11.302
ENABLES FRAUD- AND- IT ISN'T

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:13.037
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ACTUAL

02:30:13.104 --> 02:30:18.542
TERROR OF- YOU KNOW THERE'S. A

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:19.243
PROVISION OF CLINICAL CARE. I

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:20.411
THINK SOMEONE ENGAGE IN THAT

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:21.846
SHOULD BE PER. FROM BEING ABLE

02:30:21.912 --> 02:30:23.714
TO CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO DO

02:30:23.781 --> 02:30:26.250
THAT SO THEY LET'S SAY- MISS

STATE AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES-

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:39.697
USING THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE

02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:41.999
AUTHORITY TO ALLOW. PATIENTS TO

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:44.502
ESSENTIALLY- EITHER RECEIVE

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.070

02:30:46.137 --> 02:30:48.372
THEY WERE ENTITLED TO OR- BE

02:30:48.439 --> 02:30:49.774
ABLE TO PERFORM YOU KNOW. THAT

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.609
THAT IS A PUT OTHER PEOPLE AT

02:30:51.675 --> 02:30:52.977
RISK SO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:54.345
PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION TO YOUR

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:56.380
AGENCY OF THE STATE. THAT WHY

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.415
SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:59.049
THEM TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.584

CONTINUE TO DEFRAUD THE THAT

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:08.292
THE THAT THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:10.995
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:12.663
THEY WERE BEING A- WELL THE

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:16.834
REASON THAT THE CLIENTS. AND

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:17.334
WONDER REASONS ARE BEING

02:31:17.401 --> 02:31:18.469
SANCTIONED. THIS SENATOR I CAN

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.905
ASSURE YOU. THAT WE HAVE TAKEN

02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:22.873
A FRESH LOOK AT THESE CASES.

02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.142
ISSUES OF FINANCIAL FRAUD OR

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:27.411
THINGS THAT COME TO FREQUENTLY

02:31:27.478 --> 02:31:29.480
BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD. I

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.682
TAKE THE VIEW OF PRETTY MUCH

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:33.551
CLOSE TO ZERO TOLERANCE.

02:31:33.617 --> 02:31:35.319
POSITION IN THESE KINDS OF

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:37.321
THINGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:31:37.388 --> 02:31:38.989
VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT

02:31:39.056 --> 02:31:41.659
ARISE ONE IS THE FINANCIAL

02:31:41.725 --> 02:31:43.928
FRAUD. IT BECAUSE IT'S A FRAUD

02:31:43.994 --> 02:31:46.263
AS YOU IDENTIFIED ON THE ENTIRE

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:48.732
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. SECONDLY

02:31:48.799 --> 02:31:50.568
I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS THAT A

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:52.870
PHYSICIAN WHO COMMITS FINANCIAL

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:55.439
FRAUD. IS WELL NOT THE KIND OF

02:31:55.506 --> 02:31:56.407
PERSON THAT REALLY SHOULD BE A

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.476
PHYSICIAN FULL STOP IT IS

02:31:58.542 --> 02:32:00.478
LIKELY NOT TO PROVIDE THE BEST

02:32:00.544 --> 02:32:02.613
CARE TO PATIENTS SO I CAN

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:04.415
ASSURE YOU WE TAKE THESE THINGS

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:06.784
VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE ENGAGED

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:07.918
IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:09.453
ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:12.056
APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION.

02:32:12.122 --> 02:32:14.558
IN THESE TYPES OF CASES AND WE

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:17.595
HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO HAVE MUCH

02:32:17.661 --> 02:32:20.331
MORE. STRENUOUS AND STRICT

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:22.066
APPROACHES TO THESE CASES I

02:32:22.132 --> 02:32:23.400
THINK THERE ARE SOME OF THE

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:25.002
MOST SERIOUS CASES THAT COME

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:26.971
BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:28.405
WE'RE LOOKING TO DEAL WITH

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.307
THEM. IN THE IN THE MOST

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:32.109
APPROPRIATE WAY WHICH IN MANY

02:32:32.176 --> 02:32:34.011
CASES. WILL HAVE TO BE

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:35.613
REVOCATION SO I HEAR WHAT

TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE ISSUE OF

02:32:44.321 --> 02:32:45.523

02:32:45.589 --> 02:32:47.825
CASES I APPRECIATE THAT I AGREE

02:32:47.892 --> 02:32:48.826
WITH YOU THAT SOMETIMES I

02:32:48.893 --> 02:32:49.593
WONDER WHY EVERYTHING ON

PROBATION WHICH JUST REVOKED

02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:53.898

UTILIZED AND WE'RE GUIDELINES

02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:29.753
WERE DEVIATED FROM THE REASONS

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:31.388
FOR THE DEVIATION. IS THAT

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:33.790
INFORMATION CORRECT. YEAH

02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:35.158
CREATING A LOT THE ANSWER THAT

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:37.995
QUESTION. YES PLEASE I'M

02:40:38.061 --> 02:40:40.530
LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER. THANK

02:40:40.597 --> 02:40:41.765
YOU I MEAN THE ANSWER IS THAT

02:40:41.832 --> 02:40:43.400
THAT INFORMATION IS NOT

02:40:43.467 --> 02:40:45.669
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RIGHT AND I

02:40:45.736 --> 02:40:47.337
MEDIAN HELPFUL FOR ME TO

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:52.175
PUBLICLY ELLISON I COMPLETELY

UNDERSTAND I COMPLETELY

02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:56.146
UNDERSTAND THE CONFIDENTIALITY.

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:58.181
AND PHYSICIANS AND ALL OF THAT

02:40:58.248 --> 02:40:59.750
MY CONCERN IS WHAT WE'RE

02:40:59.816 --> 02:41:01.118
LOOKING AT HERE AND WHAT I'M

02:41:01.184 --> 02:41:02.953
GOING TO BE QUESTIONING THE

02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:05.022
FOLKS ABOUT NEXT IS THE

02:41:05.088 --> 02:41:06.623
EFFICACY OF THE DISCIPLINARY

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.525
PROCESS AND WHETHER

02:41:08.592 --> 02:41:12.129
DISCIPLINARY POSED. THAT IS

02:41:12.195 --> 02:41:13.697
EFFECTIVE AND- WE DIDN'T

02:41:13.764 --> 02:41:15.499
PUBLISH DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:17.334
THE MEDICAL BOARD PUBLISHED

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:19.369
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND DID

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:21.138
MORE THAN THAT PUT THEM IN THE

02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:23.440
CALIFORNIA CODE. OF REGULATIONS

02:41:23.507 --> 02:41:26.410
AND A MANUAL THAT YOU PUBLISH

02:41:26.476 --> 02:41:29.146
SO RIGHT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE

02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:31.782
A LOOK AT CONSISTENCY BETWEEN

02:41:31.848 --> 02:41:33.483
THE IMPOSITION OF DISCIPLINE

02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:35.452
AND THE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES

02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:37.954
IN EVALUATE DEVIATIONS FROM THE

02:41:38.021 --> 02:41:39.990
GUIDELINES. AND IN SOME CASES

02:41:40.057 --> 02:41:42.559
WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE

02:41:42.626 --> 02:41:42.993
PERSONAL IDENTIFYING

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:45.328
INFORMATION. THE Y. AND THAT'S

02:41:45.395 --> 02:41:47.564
THE REASON WHY I MEAN WE

02:41:47.631 --> 02:41:48.999
PRESUME REGULARITY HERE BELIEVE

02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:52.302
IT OR NOT. DESPITE THE TENOR OF

02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:54.404
SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS BUT

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:55.005
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:57.607
AT. AND ALSO LET ME JUST LET ME

02:41:57.674 --> 02:41:59.943
JUST MOVE ON CAN SOMEONE TELL

02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:01.745
ME WHAT THE RANGE OF MAYBE THIS

02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:04.181
IS BEEN ANSWERED. THE RANGE OF

02:42:04.247 --> 02:42:07.350
POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE- IS IN A

02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:11.688
PHYSICIAN MISCONDUCT. A CASE

02:42:11.755 --> 02:42:13.790
MEAN PUBLIC REPRIMAND IS

02:42:13.857 --> 02:42:14.391
SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THEN IT

02:42:14.458 --> 02:42:16.560
GOES TO WHAT. WELL I MEAN IF

02:42:16.626 --> 02:42:18.728
YOU JUST START WITH THE MOST

02:42:18.795 --> 02:42:20.430
SIGNIFICANT SANCTION THAT IS

02:42:20.497 --> 02:42:23.333
REVOCATION. AND THEN IF YOU GO

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.368
DOWN AND IF YOU'RE REVOKED YOU

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:26.670
REVOKE YOU CANNOT PRACTICE

02:42:26.736 --> 02:42:27.771
MEDICINE IN THE STATE OF

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:28.972
CALIFORNIA DID YOU HAVE

02:42:29.039 --> 02:42:31.374
SUSPENSION WHERE YOU CAN

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:31.975
PRACTICE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD

02:42:32.042 --> 02:42:33.610
OF TIME. AND THEN YOU HAVE

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:35.779
PROBATION WITH CONDITIONS AND

02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:37.614
THE CONDITIONS CAN BE ANYTHING

02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:40.517
FROM A RANGE OF PROHIBITION TO

02:42:40.584 --> 02:42:43.753
CERTAIN KINDS OF PRACTICE- TO-

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:45.856
NEEDS OR OF A CHEMICAL.

02:42:45.922 --> 02:42:49.426
MONITORING FOR A PRACTICE

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:51.528
MONITOR FOR SUPERVISION THEY'RE

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:52.863
CONDITIONS MAY BE LESS ONEROUS

02:42:52.929 --> 02:42:55.866
SUCH AS THE TAKING OF A- OF A

02:42:55.932 --> 02:42:59.836
COURSE FOR A MEANS OF STUDY.

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:02.372
THEN YOU GO TO A PUBLIC

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:05.642
REPRIMAND. WHICH IS A SIMPLY A

02:43:05.709 --> 02:43:07.110
PUBLIC RECORD REPRIMAND AND

02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:08.411
THERE MAY BE CONDITIONS

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:10.080
ATTACHED THERE IN TERMS OF

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:12.349
TRAINING OR COURSES. AND THEN

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:13.350
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED A

02:43:13.416 --> 02:43:14.384
WARNING LETTER AND NO ONE

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:15.585
REALLY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS BUT

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:17.654
IT'S NOT BINDING AND IT'S FOR

02:43:17.721 --> 02:43:19.523
ADVISORS. SO THERE'S A WHOLE

02:43:19.589 --> 02:43:22.526
SPECTER IS A SPECTRUM. WITHIN

02:43:22.592 --> 02:43:23.960

ONE UP TO REPLICATION AND WITH

02:43:28.765 --> 02:43:30.667
RESPECT TO PROBATION WITH OR

BEEN REFERENCE PREVIOUSLY TO IN

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.673
WHICH CASE I APOLOGIZE IF AN

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:38.008
INDIVIDUAL VIOLATES THE

02:43:38.074 --> 02:43:38.842
PROBATION WITH OR WITHOUT

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:42.179
CONDITIONS WHAT'S THE SANCTION.

02:43:42.245 --> 02:43:43.013
DO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:44.447
FRONT OF THE LINE AND GO

02:43:44.514 --> 02:43:45.682
THROUGH THE COMPLAINT PROCESS

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:47.617
AGAIN OR IS THERE SOMETHING.

02:43:47.684 --> 02:43:49.819
THAT AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS WELL

02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:51.388
I MEAN IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:53.390
OF THE VIOLATE PROBATION AND

02:43:53.456 --> 02:43:54.658
PROBATION WAS DONE IN

02:43:54.724 --> 02:43:56.626
SUBSTITUTION FOR REPLICATION

YOU CAN RESULT IN REVOCATION

02:43:58.395 --> 02:43:59.129
RIGHT BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE

02:43:59.196 --> 02:44:01.398
A DISCIPLINE THAT'S A SUSPENDED

02:44:01.464 --> 02:44:02.465
REVOCATION WITH THE PROBATION

02:44:02.532 --> 02:44:04.568

IS THAT CORRECT- I YES I

02:45:34.758 --> 02:45:36.426
BELIEVE THAT SERVE AS AN EASY

02:45:36.493 --> 02:45:37.927
WAY TO DESCRIBE IT OKAY MAY I

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:39.529
PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION

02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:42.365
CENTER OFF YES. SO IT HEY SIS

02:45:42.432 --> 02:45:44.067
PRACTICE ORDER MAY BE USED IF

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:46.670
THERE'S A AN INITIAL POSITIVE

02:45:46.736 --> 02:45:48.638
RESULTS ON A BIOLOGICAL FLUID

02:45:48.705 --> 02:45:51.574
TEST BUT THEN THOSE RESULTS-

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:54.244
THE BILL LAB COSTS PROVIDE

02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:57.847
LEGAL BE. DEFENSIBLE RESULTS IN

02:45:57.914 --> 02:46:00.984
SO IT COULD BE THAT IF IT COMES

02:46:01.051 --> 02:46:03.553
BACK- NEGATIVE AFTER FURTHER

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:05.855
TESTING THE **** PRACTICE ORDER

02:46:05.922 --> 02:46:07.757
IS LIFTED BUT IT'S INITIALLY

02:46:07.824 --> 02:46:09.726
IMPOSED RIGHT AWAY WHEN A

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:13.129
POSITIVE TEST IS RETURNED. FOR

EXAMPLE WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT

02:46:14.898 --> 02:46:15.732

PENSION. A TURKISH ADAM THE WAY

02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:37.287
IT'S THE REV STAYED WITH A

CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME FOR

02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:42.892
PROBATION THAT ALWAYS THE CASE.

02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:44.994
THAT'S AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THAT

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:46.996
IS ALWAYS HOW IT'S WORDED OKAY

02:46:47.063 --> 02:46:50.300
AND SO ANOTHER. WAY CASEY'S

THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE IN

02:46:58.108 --> 02:47:02.312
TIME. THEN THIS IS PART THIS

02:47:02.379 --> 02:47:03.413
ORDER WILL BE PUT IN PLACE

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.014

MINOR VIOLATIONS OR- BUT SIMPLE

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:55.999
DEPARTURES IS THAT YOUR

02:47:56.065 --> 02:47:58.468
UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE OF THE

02:47:58.535 --> 02:48:06.876
PUBLIC REPRIMAND. YEAH. I CAN

02:48:06.943 --> 02:48:09.245

02:48:37.273 --> 02:48:41.044
THERE'S A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:42.812
DEMONSTRATING THAT THIS PERSON

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:57.060
SAW WHERE PUBLIC REPRIMAND IS

02:48:57.126 --> 02:48:58.328

TO MAINTAIN RECORDS CORRECT

02:49:25.021 --> 02:49:27.957
WELL. THAT THAT IS TRUE WITH

02:49:28.024 --> 02:49:30.994
REGARD THE RANGES WHERE YOU

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:32.595
ASSUME THAT ALL OF THE

02:49:32.662 --> 02:49:34.430
ALLEGATIONS ARE PRUDENT NOW

02:49:34.497 --> 02:49:36.399
YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE AREA

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:40.970
OF. DISCRETION AND WHAT IS

02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:43.473
NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:45.174
AND REHABILITATION WHEN IT'S

02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:47.377
NOT INCONSISTENT WITH PROVIDING

02:49:47.443 --> 02:49:49.212
PUBLIC PROTECTION. WELL WE JUST

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:50.146
CAN'T LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I

02:49:50.213 --> 02:49:53.316
UNDERSTAND IN THE CASE OF

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:54.684
STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS. THOSE

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:56.953
ARE CASES WERE AGREED TO WHERE

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:59.022
THE PHYSICIAN ADMITS TO THE

02:49:59.088 --> 02:50:00.924
ALLEGATION OF THE ACCUSATION

02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:02.592
AND AGREES TO THE PENALTY IN

02:50:02.659 --> 02:50:03.393
THE STIPULATED SETTLEMENT

02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:06.195
CORRECT. THAT IS SAID NOT

02:50:06.262 --> 02:50:08.064
ALWAYS THE CASE AND USUALLY

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:10.667
WHAT THEY'RE ADMITTING TO IS

02:50:10.733 --> 02:50:13.970
THAT IF THE MATTER WERE TO GO

02:50:14.037 --> 02:50:16.406
TO HEARING THE BOARD MAY BE

02:50:16.472 --> 02:50:20.176
ABLE TO PROVE THE ALLEGATONS-

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:22.812
BY THE CLEAR CONVINCING

02:50:22.879 --> 02:50:24.981
EVIDENCE MAY BE ABLE TO. NOT

02:50:25.048 --> 02:50:26.282
THAT THERE A GREEN THAT WOULD

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:28.017
HAPPEN THEY'RE NOT AGREEING

02:50:28.084 --> 02:50:30.186
THAT THEY- COMMITTED THE

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:34.090
VIOLATIONS. AND THERE'S STILL A

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:35.992
LOT. UP IN THE AIR AND

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:37.961
SOMETIMES WHAT'S AT ISSUE IS

02:50:38.027 --> 02:50:40.563
THAT- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:42.131
THE BOARD MADE ONLY BE ABLE TO

02:50:42.198 --> 02:50:44.567
PROVE ONE SIMPLE NEGLIGENT

02:50:44.634 --> 02:50:46.469
ACTS. AND IF THE CASE WERE TO

02:50:46.536 --> 02:50:48.004
GO TO HEARING AND THAT WAS THE

02:50:48.071 --> 02:50:50.873
FINDING THEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:53.343
LAW JUDGE WOULD PROPOSE A

02:50:53.409 --> 02:50:55.211
DISMISSAL AND THERE WOULDN'T BE

02:50:55.278 --> 02:50:57.113
GROUNDS TO OVERTURN THAT

02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:02.552
DISMISSAL. SO THE BOARD. IS

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:06.389
WEIGHING. IN MANY CASES. WEBER

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:09.626
EIGHTY SIX SETTLEMENT IS.

02:51:09.692 --> 02:51:12.362
SUPPORTIVE OF PUBLIC PROTECTION

02:51:12.428 --> 02:51:13.696
BECAUSE THE RISK OF GOING TO

02:51:13.763 --> 02:51:16.399
HEARING MAYBE A DISMISSAL IN

02:51:16.466 --> 02:51:18.301
WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE NO

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:20.336
REPORT TO THE PUBLIC ON THE

02:51:20.403 --> 02:51:22.805
PHYSICIAN'S PROFILE OR RISK

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:25.708
THAT THE DISCIPLINE COULD BE

02:51:25.775 --> 02:51:28.211
LESS THAN WHAT WAS ULTIMATELY

02:51:28.277 --> 02:51:31.047
NEGOTIATED. WELL THAT I THINK

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:32.815
THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF

02:51:32.882 --> 02:51:35.585
SOME OF US IN IN THAT THE- THE

02:51:35.652 --> 02:51:38.454
FOCUS TENDS TO BE TO. DISPOSE

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:39.255
OF THE MATTER WITH THE LEAST

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:42.792
RISK TO. SOMEONE THE BOARD. THE

02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:44.894
RISK OF LOSS IN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:51:44.961 --> 02:51:47.030
HEARING. OR THE OTHER REASON

02:51:47.096 --> 02:51:49.666
SHE CHU THE DEAD OF FIDE AND IN

02:51:49.732 --> 02:51:53.036
SOME CASES PERHAPS- GIVEN THE

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:54.504
NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS GIVEN THE

02:51:54.570 --> 02:51:56.406
NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THREE

02:51:56.472 --> 02:51:56.973
THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING

02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:58.908
THAT- PURSUIT THE MOVE FORWARD

02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:00.276
A FORMAL DISCIPLINE AND THE

02:52:00.343 --> 02:52:02.045
NUMBER OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF

02:52:02.111 --> 02:52:03.446
CASES THAT ARE ACTUALLY TAKEN

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:05.081
TO TRIAL THAT PERHAPS THAT

02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:06.449
NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED LET ME

02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:09.018
ASK A QUESTION IN THOSE CASES

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:10.620
STIPULATED SETTLEMENT CASES IN

02:52:10.687 --> 02:52:13.256
THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR TWENTY

02:52:13.322 --> 02:52:13.856
NINETEEN TO TWENTY AND I THINK

02:52:13.923 --> 02:52:15.324
SOMEONE INDICATED ABOUT TWO

02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:16.192
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WHAT

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:17.860
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CASES.

02:52:17.927 --> 02:52:20.430
INVOLVE PUBLIC REPRIMAND AS A

02:52:20.496 --> 02:52:32.642
PENALTY DO YOU KNOW. I THINK

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:33.576
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE

02:52:33.643 --> 02:52:34.277
INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT

02:52:34.343 --> 02:52:57.033
SENATOR.

02:53:00.737 --> 02:53:11.447
SO THE STATS. LAST

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:14.283
YEAR THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND

02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:15.618
EIGHT YOUR OUTLOOK OR PREVENT

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:18.621
OKAY. THERE WERE A FEW SAY THEY

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:20.423
WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT. YES

02:53:20.490 --> 02:53:22.792
SIR AND THAT'S WHAT PERCENTAGE

02:53:22.859 --> 02:53:32.668
OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES.

02:53:32.735 --> 02:53:34.804
WILL ALL CONTINUE YOU KNOW-

02:53:34.871 --> 02:53:35.605
WHAT OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE

02:53:35.671 --> 02:53:38.441
ISSUES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:53:38.508 --> 02:53:40.910
BEEN CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:41.944
AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN IN

02:53:42.011 --> 02:53:43.613
THE ADDRESSED US IN LETTERS TO

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:45.348
THESE COMMITTEES IS THAT THE

02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:47.316
BOARD DOESN'T FOLLOW ITS OWN

02:53:47.383 --> 02:53:50.386
DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND- I

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:52.388
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT EACH

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:55.191
CASE HAS FACTS OF ITS OWN AND

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:57.827
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ISSUES

02:53:57.894 --> 02:53:58.795
THAT THE BOARD IN THE PANELS

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:00.062
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

02:54:00.129 --> 02:54:02.198
IN DETERMINING DETERMINING THE

02:54:02.265 --> 02:54:04.000
PENALTY TO BE IMPOSED INCLUDING

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:05.401
EVIDENTIARY ISSUE SHOULD THE

02:54:05.468 --> 02:54:07.303
MATTER PROCEED FORWARD TO.

02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:08.671
TRIAL OR HEARING IN A VARIETY

02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:10.106
OF OTHER FACTORS SIMPLY IT'S

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:13.109
COMPLEX I WAS ABLE TO REVIEWS

02:54:13.176 --> 02:54:15.878
SORT OF AN INFORMAL SUMMARY- OF

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:18.047
ABOUT A HUNDRED CASES OF- THE

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:21.784
BOARDS WHERE I UNDERSTAND THE

02:54:21.851 --> 02:54:22.318
STIPULATED SETTLEMENT WAS

02:54:45.575 --> 02:55:03.593

SEVEN YEARS PROBATION AND IN

02:57:00.409 --> 02:57:01.711
THE CASE OF SOME OF THESE OTHER

02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:03.512
OFFENSES THAT I'VE LISTED A

02:57:03.579 --> 02:57:04.914

RECEIVE REFLECT ONLY A SEVEN

02:57:13.756 --> 02:57:17.560
YEAR PROBATION WAS IMPOSED. NOW

02:57:17.626 --> 02:57:19.095
I BELIEVE I UNDERSTOOD PREVIOUS

02:57:19.161 --> 02:57:21.063
TESTIMONY TO INDICATE THAT IN

02:57:21.130 --> 02:57:22.932
ADDITION TO THAT SEVEN YEAR

02:57:22.999 --> 02:57:23.499
PROBATION THERE WAS A STATE

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:30.673
REVOCATION. SARAH THAT IS THE

02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:34.276
TYPICAL. WAY THAT. ORDERS FOR

02:57:34.343 --> 02:57:36.045
PROBATION ARE WORDED STATE

02:57:36.112 --> 02:57:38.214
REVOCATION WITH A PERIOD OF

02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.316

PROBATION AND STATE REVOCATION

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:46.489
SPECIFICALLY. I'VE ASKED BEFORE

02:57:46.555 --> 02:57:47.957
LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I WANT TO

02:57:48.024 --> 02:57:49.759
ASK AGAIN OR OTHER CASES WHERE

02:57:49.825 --> 02:57:51.394
PROBATION IS IMPOSED AS A

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:56.265
PENALTY WITHOUT. ANY STATE

02:57:56.332 --> 02:57:58.000
REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION. I

02:57:58.067 --> 02:58:00.036
CANNOT THINK OF AN EXAMPLE

02:58:00.102 --> 02:58:01.971
WHERE THAT WORDING WAS NOT USED

02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:04.840
BUT I CAN'T SAY IT BUT IT'S

02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:06.976
NEVER HAPPENED. THERE'S ANOTHER

02:58:07.043 --> 02:58:09.111
CASE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED OF THE

02:58:09.178 --> 02:58:10.880
CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:58:10.946 --> 02:58:13.015
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. FAILED

02:58:13.082 --> 02:58:14.884
TO REPORT THAT CONVICTION IS

02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:16.919
REQUIRED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD.

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:18.320
NOW I LOOK AT THE GUIDELINES

02:58:18.387 --> 02:58:20.589
AND THAT SEEMS TO SPECIFY A

02:58:20.656 --> 02:58:21.424
FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR PROBATIONARY

02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:22.992
PERIOD IN SOME CASES STATE

02:58:23.059 --> 02:58:25.394
REVOCATION. BUT THE RECORDS I

02:58:25.461 --> 02:58:26.729
REVIEWED REFLECT THAT THE

02:58:26.796 --> 02:58:29.098
POSITION POSITION RECEIVED A

02:58:29.165 --> 02:58:34.203
PUBLIC REPRIMAND. NOW I REALIZE

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:35.805
YOU HAVE YOUR RECORDS AND I

02:58:35.871 --> 02:58:37.873
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MATERIAL

02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:39.375
THAT I RECEIVED BUT GIVEN THE

02:58:39.442 --> 02:58:41.577
FACT SITUATION THAT I PRESENTED

02:58:41.644 --> 02:58:43.679
WHICH YOU CONSIDER THAT TO BE A

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:45.915
MINOR OFFENSE OR A- SIMPLE

02:58:45.981 --> 02:59:00.429
DEPARTURE. ANYONE. SERAPHIM AT

02:59:00.496 --> 02:59:03.232
IT'S DIFFICULT TO RESPOND TO

02:59:03.299 --> 02:59:06.602
THESE SCENARIOS JUST BASED ON

02:59:06.669 --> 02:59:13.242
THAT INFORMATION- THE BOARD.

02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:15.845
WOULD NOT CONSIDER THAT TO BE A

02:59:15.911 --> 02:59:20.049
MINOR OFFENSE THE ISSUE IS WHAT

02:59:20.116 --> 02:59:22.585
IS THE EVIDENCE SURROUNDING IT

02:59:22.651 --> 02:59:24.286
THAT THE BOARD HAD ACCESS TO

02:59:24.353 --> 02:59:26.789
WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR CONSUMER

02:59:26.856 --> 02:59:29.992
PROTECTION- AND REHABILITATION

02:59:30.059 --> 02:59:33.129
OF THE LAST C. M. WHETHER THIS

02:59:33.195 --> 02:59:36.532
IS A SITUATION WHERE CONTINUOUS

02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:40.069
MONITORING IS REQUIRED. THE

02:59:40.136 --> 02:59:42.004
BOARD DOESN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO

02:59:42.071 --> 02:59:45.508
PUNISH PHYSICIANS AND- IF THE

02:59:45.574 --> 02:59:48.777
BOARD GOES BEYOND WHAT IS

02:59:48.844 --> 02:59:50.479
NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION

02:59:50.546 --> 02:59:52.381
THEN THE BOARD ANTICIPATES THE

02:59:52.448 --> 02:59:54.950
PHYSICIAN WOULD SEEK JUDICIAL

02:59:55.017 --> 02:59:58.220
REVIEW. AND THAT THE MATTER

02:59:58.287 --> 03:00:00.823
WOULD COME BACK TO THE BOARD TO

03:00:00.890 --> 03:00:03.859
REVIEW THE PENALTY AGAIN- AND

03:00:03.926 --> 03:00:06.162
SO. THAT'S KIND OF SURROUNDING

03:00:06.228 --> 03:00:09.999
INFORMATION BUT I AM NOT

03:00:10.065 --> 03:00:14.703
COMFORTABLE SPEAKING TO- A

03:00:14.770 --> 03:00:16.805
PARTICULAR CASE BASED ON A LINE

03:00:16.872 --> 03:00:19.508
OF INFORMATION. WHERE THAT

03:00:19.575 --> 03:00:22.711
OTHER ONE PHYSICIAN CONVICTED.

03:00:22.778 --> 03:00:24.813
AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALLIED TO THE

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:25.314
MEDICAL BOARD ABOUT THE

03:00:25.381 --> 03:00:28.350
CONVICTION. PENALTY IMPOSED

03:00:28.417 --> 03:00:31.654
PUBLIC REPRIMAND. YEAH I

03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:33.322
REALIZE YOU CAN'T COMMENT ON

03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:34.957
SOME OF THESE AND I MAY NOT

03:00:35.024 --> 03:00:36.725
HAVE THE FACTS EXACTLY RIGHT

03:00:36.792 --> 03:00:38.494
BUT I GUESS THE POINT IS

03:00:38.561 --> 03:00:40.696
THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE USE

03:00:40.763 --> 03:00:43.432
OF THE VERY LEAST PENALTY IN

03:00:43.499 --> 03:00:45.000
SOME OF THESE CASES WHICH WERE

03:00:45.067 --> 03:00:46.835
THE WERE THE OFFENSES BUT SEEM

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:50.005
TO GO TO THE VERY NATURE OF THE

03:00:50.072 --> 03:00:51.874
PHYSICIAN'S OBLIGATION

03:00:51.941 --> 03:00:54.176
INTEGRITY HONESTY. RIGHT AMONG

03:00:54.243 --> 03:00:56.145
OTHER THINGS HERE'S HERE'S

RESPONSIBILITY OF SENATOR.

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.650
BECAUSE I THINK THIS BRINGS UP

03:01:01.717 --> 03:01:05.221
A GOOD POINT- ESPECIALLY IN

03:01:05.287 --> 03:01:08.090
LIGHT OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY

03:01:08.157 --> 03:01:11.994

PIECE OF LEGISLATION- THE

03:01:37.786 --> 03:01:40.689
LEGISLATURE EXPECTS THE BOARD

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:42.491
TO CONSIDER EVIDENCE OF

03:01:42.558 --> 03:01:48.697

TO WALK OR DRIVE BEFORE BETWEEN

03:02:27.636 --> 03:02:29.238
ISSUE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD AND

03:02:29.305 --> 03:02:31.006
IT'S EITHER X. OR Y. AND

03:02:31.073 --> 03:02:32.675
THERE'S NO ROOM IN BETWEEN.

03:02:32.741 --> 03:02:34.843
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE PHYSICIAN

03:02:34.910 --> 03:02:36.478

INDICATES A FIVE YEAR PROBATION

INDICATED BEFORE PERHAPS THAT

03:02:57.800 --> 03:02:59.768
WAS PART OF THE PROCESS. HERE'S

03:02:59.835 --> 03:03:00.803
AN OTHERS GO THROUGH THESE

03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:02.304
QUICKLY I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR

03:03:02.371 --> 03:03:04.406
IT BECAUSE- PHYSICIANS PRACTICE

03:03:04.473 --> 03:03:05.841
RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF TWO

03:03:05.908 --> 03:03:07.042
PATIENTS WITH THE RECORDS

03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:08.644
REFLECTING AN EARLIER DEATH OF%

03:03:08.711 --> 03:03:10.779
THE THIRD PATIENT. AND ADMITTED

03:03:10.846 --> 03:03:16.251
MULTIPLE EXTREME DEPARTURES. SO

03:03:16.318 --> 03:03:17.653
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THERE

03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:19.555
WAS SEVEN YEAR PROBATION NO

03:03:19.621 --> 03:03:22.224
REFERENCE OF A STATE REVOCATION

03:03:22.291 --> 03:03:22.825
OR SUSPENSION AT LEAST IN THE

03:03:22.891 --> 03:03:25.327
RECORDS. OF THAT I HAVE ANOTHER

ONE UNDER WRAPS AND ARE YOU

03:03:27.029 --> 03:03:30.165
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A DECISION

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:31.800
FROM THE BOARD OR A SUMMARY

03:03:31.867 --> 03:03:34.103
THAT SOMEONE NOT BOARD STAFF

03:03:34.169 --> 03:03:35.504
PRESENTED TO YOU WELL I'M

03:03:35.571 --> 03:03:36.705
LOOKING AT THE SUMMARY THAT WAS

03:03:36.772 --> 03:03:39.274
PREPARED I DON'T HAVE BOARD

03:03:39.341 --> 03:03:41.110
DECISIONS AND OF COURSE. THAT'S

03:03:41.176 --> 03:03:41.844
OUR PROBLEM AND I'LL GET TO

03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:43.545
THAT IN A MINUTE. PHYSICIAN

03:03:43.612 --> 03:03:45.414
CONVICTED OF BATTERY UPON HIS

03:03:45.481 --> 03:03:52.421
OR HER PARTNER. OKAY CONVICTED-

03:03:52.488 --> 03:03:52.955
POSITION RECEIVED A PUBLIC

03:03:53.021 --> 03:03:58.327
REPRIMAND. PUBLIC REPRIMAND-

03:03:58.394 --> 03:04:00.262
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE PHYSICIAN

03:04:00.329 --> 03:04:01.697
CONVICTED OF AN ASSAULT WITH A

03:04:01.764 --> 03:04:04.867
DEADLY WEAPON. DR HAD A PRIOR

03:04:04.933 --> 03:04:10.606
CONVICTION FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY.

03:04:10.672 --> 03:04:14.543
PROBATION WAS IMPOSED. DESPITE

03:04:14.610 --> 03:04:15.644
THE FACT THAT THE GUIDELINES

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:17.713
WOULD TEND TO SUGGEST AS A

03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:20.983
MINIMUM PENALTY SOMETHING MORE

03:04:21.049 --> 03:04:23.419
SEVERE AND ONE FINAL AND I

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:25.220
THINK AND THEN- CLOSE OBVIOUSLY

03:04:25.287 --> 03:04:26.889
THEY'RE MORE POSITION

03:04:26.955 --> 03:04:28.257
APPARENTLY FAILED TO FILE A

03:04:28.323 --> 03:04:29.925
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:32.194
REPORT OF ABUSE IN A KNOWN

03:04:32.261 --> 03:04:33.996
ABUSE CASE YOUNG CHILD WAS

03:04:34.062 --> 03:04:36.465
SUBSEQUENTLY ABUSED FURTHER.

03:04:36.532 --> 03:04:39.635
AND DIED. ONE OR MORE OF YOUR

03:04:39.701 --> 03:04:41.437
EXPERTS SOMEONE'S EXPERT

03:04:41.503 --> 03:04:42.671
CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS AN

03:04:42.738 --> 03:04:44.606
EXTREME DEPARTURE. AND THE

03:04:44.673 --> 03:04:46.842
PENALTY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:50.245
WAS A PUBLIC REPRIMAND. SO YOU

03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:52.347
KNOW I'M NOT THIS IS NOT A

03:04:52.414 --> 03:04:54.650
FRIEND I GOTCHA SITUATION- I

03:04:54.716 --> 03:04:56.185
MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE FACTS

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:57.920
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THEM. AND

03:04:57.986 --> 03:04:59.888
THE MORE THESE THAT HAVE BEEN

03:04:59.955 --> 03:05:01.590
SUGGESTED THE POINT IS THAT

03:05:01.657 --> 03:05:03.892
THERE APPEAR TO BE. A VARIETY

03:05:03.959 --> 03:05:07.062
OF CASES WHERE. A LESSER

03:05:07.129 --> 03:05:08.797
PENALTIES HAVE BEEN IMPOSED.

03:05:08.864 --> 03:05:09.965
WHERE THE GUIDELINES SUGGEST

03:05:10.032 --> 03:05:11.700
THAT MORE SERIOUS PENALTIES AT

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:13.001
LEAST BE CONSIDERED IF NOT

03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:14.937
OPPOSED AS A METHOD OF.

03:05:15.003 --> 03:05:16.138
CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER OF

03:05:16.205 --> 03:05:18.440
REVOCATION AS A METHOD OF

03:05:18.507 --> 03:05:19.942
CORRECTIVE ACTION AND

03:05:20.008 --> 03:05:23.812
REHABILITATION. SO I GUESS TWO

03:05:23.879 --> 03:05:26.748
QUESTIONS HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:28.684
ADDRESS THESE ACTUAL OR

03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:32.254
PERCEIVED ISSUES. CERTAINLY

03:05:32.321 --> 03:05:35.224
ISSUES PERHAPS OF THE NATURE OF

03:05:35.290 --> 03:05:36.191
THE PENALTY IMPOSED BUT

03:05:36.258 --> 03:05:37.693
CERTAINLY TRANSPARENCY AND ARE

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:39.495
THERE CHANGES IN THIS PROCESS

03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:42.297
THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER HERE

03:05:42.364 --> 03:05:42.831
TO MAKE THE DISCIPLINARY

03:05:42.898 --> 03:05:45.133
PROCESS MAKE MORE SENSE TO US.

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:47.469
AND TRANSPARENT. APPS WITH

03:05:47.536 --> 03:05:50.739
REPORTS REDACTED AS TO PERSONAL.

03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:52.574
A DEFINING INFORMATION SO WE

03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:54.810
CAN EVALUATE HOW THE BOARD IS

03:05:54.877 --> 03:05:57.446
DISCIPLINING PHYSICIANS THAT

03:05:57.513 --> 03:06:01.116
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO- REGULATE

03:06:01.183 --> 03:06:05.254
LICENSE AND- AND CONTROL IN THE

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:07.089
SENSE OF PERFORMANCE QUALITY

03:06:07.155 --> 03:06:12.094
MISCONDUCT. I THOUGHT. US

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.829
SENATOR IF I COULD INTERJECT

03:06:13.896 --> 03:06:15.764
THERE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT

03:06:15.831 --> 03:06:17.799
HAS BEEN- CONFOUNDING

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:20.769
JURISDICTIONS IN MANY PLACES I

03:06:20.836 --> 03:06:23.672
CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT. THE

03:06:23.739 --> 03:06:26.608
DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE HERE IS

03:06:26.675 --> 03:06:30.178
THAT THERE IS A NEED. TO HAVE A

03:06:30.245 --> 03:06:32.614
SETTLEMENT PROCESS- THE MEDICAL

03:06:32.681 --> 03:06:38.353
pOUT OF MONEY- WE ARE NOT IN A

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.255
FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE BASIS-

03:06:40.322 --> 03:06:42.424
AND WE NEED TO FIND EFFICIENT

03:06:42.491 --> 03:06:44.626
WAYS OF DEALING WITH CASES. FOR

03:06:44.693 --> 03:06:45.460
REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:06:45.527 --> 03:06:47.796
EXPLAINED THE SETTLEMENT

03:06:47.863 --> 03:06:50.165
PROCESS BY ITS VERY NATURE IS

03:06:50.232 --> 03:06:52.200
CONFIDENTIAL FOR REASONS THAT

03:06:52.267 --> 03:06:54.937
HAPPEN EXPLAINS. WHAT THEREFORE

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:57.506
WE NEED TO CONSIDER. ALONG THE

03:06:57.573 --> 03:06:58.273
LINES OF WHAT YOU HAVE

03:06:58.340 --> 03:07:01.610
SUGGESTED IS A MORE TRANSPARENT

03:07:01.677 --> 03:07:05.247
MANNER. OF SETTING FORTH HOW

03:07:05.314 --> 03:07:06.381
THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED

03:07:06.448 --> 03:07:09.718
WHAT GOES INTO THEM. I AND

03:07:09.785 --> 03:07:12.854
PERHAPS IT MEANS- ISSUING

03:07:12.921 --> 03:07:15.557
REVISED GUIDELINES ISSUING MORE

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:19.328
COMPLEX GUIDELINES ISSUING

03:07:19.394 --> 03:07:22.698
REPORTS WHERE- CASES ARE

03:07:22.764 --> 03:07:26.168
ANONYMIZED BUT TO EXPLAIN

03:07:26.234 --> 03:07:29.571
BETTER THE RANGE OF SANCTIONS

03:07:29.638 --> 03:07:31.073
AND THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:35.544
THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE FACE. IS

03:07:35.611 --> 03:07:37.846
THAT GIVEN THE MOUNTAIN OF

03:07:37.913 --> 03:07:41.617
CASES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

03:07:41.683 --> 03:07:43.318
IS THAT THE SETTLEMENTS REMAIN

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:44.386
A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:48.924
IT. BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT

03:07:48.991 --> 03:07:50.759
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A MORE

03:07:50.826 --> 03:07:54.896
TRANSPARENT WAY OF EXPLAINING

03:07:54.963 --> 03:07:56.832
HOW THESE CASES ARE RESOLVED.

03:07:56.898 --> 03:08:01.036
WHAT FACTORS GO INTO THEM. AND

03:08:01.103 --> 03:08:02.771
THE BENEFITS THAT ARE ACHIEVED

03:08:02.838 --> 03:08:04.673
BY DOING IT THIS WAY FOR THOSE

03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:06.141
OF US WHO WERE INVOLVED IN

03:08:06.208 --> 03:08:09.845
THESE CASES. ON A DAILY BASIS

03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:11.813
WE KNOW THAT BY RESOLVING THEM

03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:14.616
QUICKLY. BY GETTING SOMETIMES

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:16.652
VERY STRICT UNDERTAKINGS I

03:08:16.718 --> 03:08:19.221
UNDERSTAND THE CASES THAT YOU

03:08:19.287 --> 03:08:23.058
HAVE SELECTED. OUR DONE FOR

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:24.926
UPDATE FIT INTO A CERTAIN

03:08:24.993 --> 03:08:27.095
PATTERN. WE COULD SELECT OTHER

03:08:27.162 --> 03:08:29.164
CASES WHERE THIS THE

03:08:29.231 --> 03:08:30.699
STIPULATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY

03:08:30.766 --> 03:08:32.934
SEVERE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE

03:08:33.001 --> 03:08:34.503
POINT THEY GO INTO A RANGE

03:08:34.569 --> 03:08:37.572
BECAUSE THE CASES REQUIRE. THAT

03:08:37.639 --> 03:08:39.274
THEY GOING TO ARRANGE BUT I

03:08:39.341 --> 03:08:41.476
CERTAINLY TAKE YOUR POINT THAT

03:08:41.543 --> 03:08:42.611
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

03:08:42.678 --> 03:08:44.980
TRANSPARENCY. IN THE VERY

03:08:45.047 --> 03:08:47.983
COMPLEX FACTORS THAT GO INTO IT

03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:49.851
AND I THINK THE MEDICAL BOARD

03:08:49.918 --> 03:08:51.720
NEEDS TO MAKE A STRONGER CASE

03:08:51.787 --> 03:08:53.822
ON HOW RETAINING THESE TYPES OF

03:08:53.889 --> 03:08:56.058
SYSTEMS. ARE IN THE PUBLIC

03:08:56.124 --> 03:08:58.894
INTEREST BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:01.463
LOOK AT THE CURRENT PROCESSES

03:09:01.530 --> 03:09:02.397
BY WHICH THE STIPULATED

03:09:02.464 --> 03:09:04.533
SETTLEMENTS ARE ARRIVED AT IN

03:09:04.599 --> 03:09:08.937
OUR APPROVED. THERE IS BOARD

03:09:09.004 --> 03:09:10.739
OVERSIGHT OF IT. NOW MAYBE WE

03:09:10.806 --> 03:09:12.808
CAN LOOK AT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:13.675
OR A DIFFERENT FORM OF

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:16.511
OVERSIGHT. BUT THAT DOES EXIST

03:09:16.578 --> 03:09:18.547
IT DOES EXIST NOW AND I'VE SEEN

03:09:18.613 --> 03:09:22.050
IT WORK- BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:23.485
THAT WE NEED TO THINK OF MORE

03:09:23.552 --> 03:09:25.954
TRANSPARENT WAYS OF EXPLAINING

03:09:26.021 --> 03:09:29.558
WHAT IS. A VERY COMPLICATED.

03:09:29.624 --> 03:09:34.096
VERY LEGALISTIC PROCESS. THANK

03:09:34.162 --> 03:09:36.131
YOU AND LISTEN I WANT TO THANK

03:09:36.198 --> 03:09:36.565

VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BY

03:09:43.405 --> 03:09:46.108
SOME OF US WHO WERE PROBABLY

03:09:46.174 --> 03:09:46.675
BEING VERY DIFFICULT AT THE

03:09:46.742 --> 03:09:48.210
TIME WE ASK THEM. BUT ONE OF

THE THINGS YOU CAN ADD TO MY

03:09:49.478 --> 03:09:51.346

WE RAISED IN OUR LETTER THIS IS

03:13:10.679 --> 03:13:12.047
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE

03:13:12.113 --> 03:13:13.048
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER

03:13:13.114 --> 03:13:14.449
CHANGING DURING THE SUNSET

03:13:14.516 --> 03:13:16.351

HAVE TO WAIT FOR PATIENTS TO BE

03:13:17.886 --> 03:13:24.025
HARMED BEFORE. THE BOARD CAN

03:13:24.092 --> 03:13:25.961
START TAKING ACTION. FROM A

03:13:26.027 --> 03:13:27.729

ATTORNEYS WE UNDERSTAND AND

03:13:44.412 --> 03:13:45.580
APPRECIATE THAT EXCUSE

03:13:45.647 --> 03:13:46.915
PHYSICIANS ARE ENTITLED DUE

03:13:46.982 --> 03:13:48.650
PROCESS AND ANY PRECEDING THAT

03:13:48.717 --> 03:13:49.718
MAY IMPACT THEIR CONTINUED

03:13:49.784 --> 03:13:51.419
ABILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE.

03:13:51.486 --> 03:13:53.388
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RIGHT AND

03:13:53.455 --> 03:13:54.122
PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE

03:13:54.189 --> 03:13:56.424
SYSTEM. BUT IN OUR OBSERVATION

03:13:56.491 --> 03:13:57.792
AS WE HAVE POINTED OUT IN OUR

03:13:57.859 --> 03:13:59.995
LETTER. THIS RATE CAN BE ABUSED

03:14:00.061 --> 03:14:00.795
BY PHYSICIANS AND THEIR

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:02.397
ATTORNEYS WHO USE AN ARRAY OF

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:03.999
STALL TACTICS TO DRAG OUT THE

03:14:04.065 --> 03:14:05.867
PROCESS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

03:14:05.934 --> 03:14:07.202
OFTEN FOR YEARS AT GREAT RISK

03:14:07.268 --> 03:14:08.970
TO THE PUBLIC. AN APPROPRIATE

03:14:09.037 --> 03:14:14.175
BALANCE. MUST BE IMPLEMENTED.

03:14:14.242 --> 03:14:14.743
WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC.

03:14:14.809 --> 03:14:16.211
ISSUE THE BOY SURVEY RESULTS

03:14:16.277 --> 03:14:17.345
INDICATE THAT THE PUB

03:14:17.412 --> 03:14:18.446
EXPERIENCE THAT THE COMPLAINT.

03:14:18.513 --> 03:14:21.349
DOESN'T BUT THE VAST MAJORITY

03:14:21.416 --> 03:14:22.450
MAJORITY OF FIRST. LABELING

03:14:22.517 --> 03:14:25.086
THEIR- AS OR VERY. WE'VE HER

03:14:25.153 --> 03:14:26.654
STORIES OF PATIENT. WHOSE CASES

03:14:26.721 --> 03:14:28.890
WERE CLOSED WITHOUT EVER BEING

03:14:28.957 --> 03:14:29.691
INTERVIEWED BY ANYONE ON THE

03:14:29.758 --> 03:14:32.160
BOARD. CLICK AND AS A TURN WE-

03:14:32.227 --> 03:14:34.262
THAT THE BOARD CAN ONLY PROCEED

03:14:34.329 --> 03:14:35.230
ON A COMPLAINT IF IT HAD THE

03:14:35.296 --> 03:14:37.198
STATUTORY BASIS TO DO SO. BUT

03:14:37.265 --> 03:14:38.900
THE PROCEDURES AS THEY EXIST

03:14:38.967 --> 03:14:41.202
ARE DEVALUING OFTEN TRAUMATIC

03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:42.370
EXPERIENCES THAT THESE

03:14:42.437 --> 03:14:44.105
COMPLAINANTS HAVE INDOOR. AND

03:14:44.172 --> 03:14:44.606
TO CONTINUE AND THEY'RE

03:14:44.672 --> 03:14:46.041
CONTINUING TO BREAK DOWN THE

03:14:46.107 --> 03:14:47.675
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

03:14:47.742 --> 03:14:49.310
AND THE BOARD. I THINK SEVERAL

03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:50.545
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED

03:14:50.612 --> 03:14:52.213
TODAY THE BOARD REALLY REFLECT

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:56.885
THAT. A BRING BEAR OUR FORTY

03:14:56.951 --> 03:14:57.952
YEARS OF AGE. IN MY- CALIFORNIA

03:14:58.019 --> 03:15:00.021
REGULATORY BOARDS AND I. OF THE

03:15:00.088 --> 03:15:01.890
YEARS TO HOLD THESE SPORTS. TO

03:15:01.956 --> 03:15:04.259
PROTECT THE PUBLIC NOT THE PER.

03:15:04.325 --> 03:15:04.859
I WILL FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY

03:15:04.926 --> 03:15:06.561
ON A FOUR RECOMMEND. THAT

03:15:06.628 --> 03:15:08.229
ENHANCE THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO

03:15:08.296 --> 03:15:09.497
ENSURE THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION

03:15:09.564 --> 03:15:11.766
REMAINS AS PARAMOUNT PRIORITY.

03:15:11.833 --> 03:15:13.234
AND IT'S HARD TO TELL MORE

03:15:13.301 --> 03:15:14.469
FULLY DETAILED IN OUR WRITTEN

03:15:14.536 --> 03:15:17.272
TESTIMONY THAT WE SUBMITTED.

03:15:17.338 --> 03:15:18.840
UNDER NUMBER ONE IS THE BOARD'S

03:15:18.907 --> 03:15:20.642
FEES MUST BE A- I REALLY THIS

03:15:20.708 --> 03:15:21.943
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;S NOT THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:23.912
HEARING BUT IT IS VERY RELEVANT

03:15:23.978 --> 03:15:25.313
TO THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO

03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:26.748
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A ROBUST

03:15:26.815 --> 03:15:28.450
ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. THEY HAVE

03:15:28.516 --> 03:15:30.585
NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE TWO

03:15:30.652 --> 03:15:31.186
THOUSAND SIX AND THE BOARD HAS

03:15:31.252 --> 03:15:32.821
MORE THAN JUSTIFIED ITS NEED TO

03:15:32.887 --> 03:15:34.389
INCREASE ITS FEES. THIS IS

03:15:34.456 --> 03:15:35.690
CRITICAL FOR THE BOARD TO

03:15:35.757 --> 03:15:37.025
ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION OF

03:15:37.092 --> 03:15:38.460
PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND THE FACT

03:15:38.526 --> 03:15:39.627
THAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WAS

03:15:39.694 --> 03:15:40.929
JUST TELLING YOU THAT THEY'RE

03:15:40.995 --> 03:15:42.097
NOT IN A FINANCIALLY

03:15:42.163 --> 03:15:43.832
SUSTAINABLE POSITION AND

03:15:43.898 --> 03:15:45.433
APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED TO

03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:49.003
SETTLE CASES IN ORDER TO SAVE

03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.771
MONEY. IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.

03:15:49.838 --> 03:15:51.072
THE SECOND RECOMMEND. WE HAVE

03:15:51.139 --> 03:15:52.640
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

03:15:52.707 --> 03:15:53.575
HAD TO PUT. MEMBERS TO THE

03:15:53.641 --> 03:15:56.778

03:16:06.521 --> 03:16:07.989
PATIENTS ADVOCATES RACE SERIES

03:16:08.056 --> 03:16:09.190
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BOARD'S

03:16:09.257 --> 03:16:11.159
ABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC.

PUBLIC MAJORITY ON THE BOARD.

03:16:16.364 --> 03:16:17.132
WOULD DECREASE THE RISK OF

03:16:17.198 --> 03:16:18.867
ANTITRUST EXPOSURE AND HAVE

03:16:18.933 --> 03:16:20.435
VALUE ADDED OF THE MORE

CHAU SPONSORED A BILL THAT

03:17:13.821 --> 03:17:15.623
WOULD AUTHORIZE DCA TO EXERCISE

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:17.525
ADDITIONAL SUPERVISION. OVER AT

03:17:17.592 --> 03:17:19.260
CEMEX SEMI AUTONOMOUS BOARDS

03:17:19.327 --> 03:17:20.461
BUT THAT LEGISLATION WAS

03:17:20.528 --> 03:17:22.497
UNSUCCESSFUL AFTER HEAVY

03:17:22.564 --> 03:17:22.964
OPPOSITION FROM TRADE

03:17:23.031 --> 03:17:24.999
ASSOCIATIONS. TO INCREASING THE

03:17:25.066 --> 03:17:26.234
NUMBER OF PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE

03:17:26.301 --> 03:17:27.702
BOARD WOULD CERTAINLY HELP TO

03:17:27.769 --> 03:17:29.037
ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC REMAINS

03:17:29.103 --> 03:17:30.705
A KEY FOCUS. OF THE BOARD'S

03:17:30.772 --> 03:17:32.140
ACTIVITY AND WITH LESSEN THE

03:17:32.207 --> 03:17:33.508
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PROFESSION

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:35.577
CONTROL THE BOARD. AND I WOULD

03:17:35.643 --> 03:17:37.178
ADD AS A ADDED IN THE LETTER

03:17:37.245 --> 03:17:38.746
THERE ARE THREE PUBLIC- AND

03:17:38.813 --> 03:17:40.181
PUBLIC MEMBER VACANCIES RIGHT

03:17:40.248 --> 03:17:49.190
NOW WHICH ARE JUST EXACERBATING.

03:17:49.257 --> 03:17:52.794
THIS PROBLEM. A THIRD. WE

03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:53.628
RECOMMEND THAT LEDGERS

03:17:53.695 --> 03:17:55.430
LEGISLATURE SET UP. ANOTHER AND-

03:17:55.496 --> 03:17:57.865
MONITOR AND A ON ALL THE- TODAY

03:17:57.932 --> 03:17:58.833
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOARD

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:00.635
EXIST ENFORCE SYSTEM AS I'M- OF

03:18:00.702 --> 03:18:01.836
GREAT CONCERN. IT IS UNDER

03:18:01.903 --> 03:18:03.171
RESEARCH. IT APPEARS THERE'S

03:18:03.238 --> 03:18:03.771
BEEN A BREAKDOWN IN THE REAL.

03:18:03.838 --> 03:18:06.341
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. OF THE

03:18:06.407 --> 03:18:07.742
TRANSFER OF THE- TO DO. AND

03:18:07.809 --> 03:18:09.143
TWENTY THIRD CREATE FURTHER.

03:18:09.210 --> 03:18:11.045
AND THE PUBLIC. IN THE IS A-

03:18:11.112 --> 03:18:13.114
LOW. WHAT IS LESS CLEAR IS WHAT

03:18:13.181 --> 03:18:14.349
TO DO ABOUT IT THE BOARD

03:18:14.415 --> 03:18:15.316
ABILITY QUICKLY INEFFICIENT I

03:18:15.383 --> 03:18:17.318
TELL. IN OUR HARM DR FROM PACK

03:18:17.385 --> 03:18:20.488
AS- AS YOU WILL DURING PUBLIC.

03:18:20.555 --> 03:18:21.956
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

03:18:22.023 --> 03:18:23.258
RESULTING THIS VERY VERY

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:25.293
SERIOUS SITUATION THROUGH THE

03:18:25.360 --> 03:18:26.661
POLITICAL PROCESS. WHERE THE

03:18:26.728 --> 03:18:28.029
PARTIES WHOSE INTERESTS ARE AT

03:18:28.096 --> 03:18:29.497
STAKE OUR LESSEN OBJECTIVES AND

03:18:29.564 --> 03:18:31.266
HAD AN EQUAL LEVELS OF INPUT.

03:18:31.332 --> 03:18:33.935
WITH THIS MAKERS IS NOT THE WAY

03:18:34.002 --> 03:18:35.303
TO DO THIS. SERIOUS REFORM OF

03:18:35.370 --> 03:18:36.604
THE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM MUST BE

03:18:36.671 --> 03:18:38.406
BASED ON EVIDENCE GATHERED AND

03:18:38.473 --> 03:18:39.941
ANALYZED BY AN INDEPENDENT

03:18:40.008 --> 03:18:41.843
RESEARCHER. SUCH AN OBJECTIVE

03:18:41.909 --> 03:18:43.645
STUDY BENEFITS EVERYONE FOR

03:18:43.711 --> 03:18:45.280
PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS IT

03:18:45.346 --> 03:18:47.015
MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A VIGOROUS

03:18:47.081 --> 03:18:48.583
TRUSTED REGULATORY PROGRAM IN

03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:50.351
PLACE. THAT PREVENTS AS MANY

03:18:50.418 --> 03:18:52.387
PATIENTS AS POSSIBLE FROM BEING

03:18:52.453 --> 03:18:53.755
DAMAGED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:18:53.821 --> 03:18:55.056
AMONG OTHER ISSUES THE

03:18:55.123 --> 03:18:56.457
ENFORCEMENT MONITOR CAN CONDUCT

03:18:56.524 --> 03:18:57.825
A THOROUGH. THOROUGH AND

03:18:57.892 --> 03:18:59.160
INDEPENDENT STUDY OF THE

03:18:59.227 --> 03:19:00.662
INSTANCES IN WHICH THE BOARD

03:19:00.728 --> 03:19:02.430
DEVIATES FROM THE DISCIPLINARY

03:19:02.497 --> 03:19:03.865
GUIDELINES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY

03:19:03.931 --> 03:19:05.233
COULD TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:06.100
EFFICACY OF THE PROBATION

03:19:06.167 --> 03:19:08.102
MONITORING PROGRAM. ASSESS

03:19:08.169 --> 03:19:09.504
WHETHER THE PUBLIC PROTECTION

03:19:09.570 --> 03:19:11.039
IS AT RISK THROUGH THESE ISSUES

03:19:11.105 --> 03:19:12.473
AND RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS TO THE

03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:13.841
GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

03:19:13.908 --> 03:19:15.109
INVOLVING SETTLEMENTS. THE

03:19:15.176 --> 03:19:16.778
MONITOR COULD ALSO RESEARCH AND

03:19:16.844 --> 03:19:18.379
RECOMMEND PROACTIVE REGULATORY

03:19:18.446 --> 03:19:20.281
APPROACHES AS WE TALKED ABOUT

03:19:20.348 --> 03:19:22.283
EARLIER. IN THE DAY IN ADDITION

03:19:22.350 --> 03:19:24.285
TO THIS EXISTING CLAIM-

03:19:24.352 --> 03:19:26.254
COMPLAINT BASED MODEL. THAT

03:19:26.321 --> 03:19:27.288
WOULD PERMIT THE BOARD TO

03:19:27.355 --> 03:19:28.690
IDENTIFY AND DISCIPLINE

03:19:28.756 --> 03:19:29.791
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PHYSICIANS

03:19:29.857 --> 03:19:31.626
BEFORE PATIENTS ARE HARMED.

03:19:31.693 --> 03:19:33.261
RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THEM TO BE

03:19:33.328 --> 03:19:33.961
HARMED AND THEN FILE A

03:19:34.028 --> 03:19:35.596
COMPLAINT. AS I MENTIONED

03:19:35.663 --> 03:19:36.664
EARLIER THIS IS AN APPROACH

03:19:36.731 --> 03:19:37.765
THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT

03:19:37.832 --> 03:19:39.300
MULTIPLE BOARDS INCLUDING THE

03:19:39.367 --> 03:19:40.902
STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. AND

03:19:40.968 --> 03:19:48.976
BASED. ON THE QUESTIONS OF THE

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:50.445
MEMBERS THIS MORE IT APPEARS

03:19:50.511 --> 03:19:51.212
THAT THE SYSTEM THAT LED TO. MY

03:19:51.279 --> 03:19:53.715
BE AND IN X. AND WELL.

03:19:53.781 --> 03:19:54.716
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU

03:19:54.782 --> 03:19:55.817
DECIDE TO APPOINT AN SOMEONE

03:19:55.883 --> 03:19:57.518
THIS CREEK ISSUE MUST BE

03:19:57.585 --> 03:19:59.020
CONSIDERED DURING THIS REGION

03:19:59.087 --> 03:20:02.724
AS THE- HERE SO HELP PLAN OUT

03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:04.425
AND GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW I

03:20:04.492 --> 03:20:07.628
KNOW WE ARE RUNNING ANTI. BUT

03:20:07.695 --> 03:20:08.162
ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN

03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:10.231
BROUGHT UP VERY MUCH TODAY IS-

03:20:10.298 --> 03:20:11.733
THE- PROCESS AND I WOULD LIKE

03:20:11.799 --> 03:20:13.634
TO REITERATE CPA I WAS WRECKED.

03:20:13.701 --> 03:20:17.004
THE BOY AND THAT SHOULD MOVE TO

03:20:17.071 --> 03:20:18.306
ATTORNEY OFFICE A A- MEANT

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:19.307
RECOMMENDED BY THE AND FOR

PROSECUTORS INVEST CAN WORK TO

03:20:24.178 --> 03:20:25.079
AS EXTRA AS POSSIBLE TO MEET

CAN PROTECTION THERE FOR AND-

03:20:27.615 --> 03:20:28.282
THIS RECOMMENDED WAS NOT AND

03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:29.984
FROM AS REC. AND WAS ONLY MADE

03:20:30.051 --> 03:20:31.753

03:21:07.522 --> 03:21:08.523
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THIS WOULD

03:21:08.589 --> 03:21:09.323
EXACERBATE THE PUBLIC TRUST

03:21:09.390 --> 03:21:10.925

CONSIDERED AND HEALTH RESEARCH

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:13.394
COULD BE CONDUCTED THAT WOULD

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:17.799
SUPPORT SUCH A DEPARTURE. FROM

03:21:17.865 --> 03:21:18.699
THE TREE GENERAL PROSECUTION. I

03:21:18.766 --> 03:21:19.667

03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:24.372
THAT THE BOARD SUSPECT THAT'S

03:21:24.439 --> 03:21:25.440
NOT RECEIVING MANY OF THESE

03:21:25.506 --> 03:21:27.708
MANDATORY REPORTS. AND THESE

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:28.843
ARE CRITICAL TOOLS THAT WILL

03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:29.977
LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION OF

03:21:30.044 --> 03:21:31.846

ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN SANTA

03:21:40.288 --> 03:21:41.689
CLARA AND WHICH- THIS IS

03:21:47.895 --> 03:21:49.430
QUESTIONS AS TO THIS THIS

03:21:49.497 --> 03:21:50.998
MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENT

03:21:51.065 --> 03:21:52.733
AND WHETHER WE NEED TO INCLUDE

03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:55.536
ADDITIONAL MANDATED REPORTS FOR

03:21:55.603 --> 03:21:58.172
A STATE AGENCIES- I DO WANNA

03:21:58.239 --> 03:21:59.307
HIGHLIGHT TO THAT WE POINTED

03:21:59.373 --> 03:22:00.875
OUT IN OUR LETTER THERE IS. A

TO TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE

03:22:05.813 --> 03:22:07.548
HUNDRED. AND FOR SOME OF THE

03:22:07.615 --> 03:22:09.016
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIRTY

03:22:09.083 --> 03:22:10.418
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE HAVE

03:22:10.485 --> 03:22:11.953
THEN AWARE OF WHAT WE ARE

03:22:12.019 --> 03:22:13.888
SUSPECTING MIGHT BE A WIDE.

03:22:13.955 --> 03:22:16.557
SPREAD PRACTICE IN WHICH PEOPLE

03:22:16.624 --> 03:22:18.259
ARE SETTLING CASES FOR THEIR

03:22:18.326 --> 03:22:20.828
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY

DIFFERENCE TO THE PLAINTIFFS

03:22:26.801 --> 03:22:28.236
AND THIS IS A WAY THAT THEY ARE

03:22:28.302 --> 03:22:29.937
AVOIDING HAVING TO REPORT THE

03:22:30.004 --> 03:22:31.038
SETTLEMENTS ESPECIALLY

03:22:31.105 --> 03:22:32.440
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVING TO

REPORT SETTLEMENTS- AND I

03:22:34.942 --> 03:22:35.843
BELIEVE THIS IS A REALLY

03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:37.612
IMPORTANT. THING THAT NEEDS TO

03:22:37.678 --> 03:22:39.013
BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER AND

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:40.548
PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST

03:22:40.615 --> 03:22:41.649
ELIMINATE THE THIRTY THOUSAND

03:22:41.716 --> 03:22:45.486
DOLLAR THRESHOLD AND ALL

03:22:45.553 --> 03:22:46.087
SETTLEMENTS SHOULD BE REPORTED

03:22:46.153 --> 03:22:48.256
TO THE BOARD. I'M AND THEN IT

03:22:48.322 --> 03:22:50.758
NUMBER TWO ON. JUST YOU KNOW.

03:22:50.825 --> 03:22:52.026
PRETTY WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:22:52.093 --> 03:22:54.529
PHYSICIAN THAT IS. ADAM IN

03:22:54.595 --> 03:22:57.231
SENATOR HER TARDIS DISTRICT

03:22:57.298 --> 03:22:58.733
THAT PERSON WAS PLACED ON HER.

03:22:58.799 --> 03:23:00.968
FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WANTED TO

03:23:01.035 --> 03:23:02.336
POINT OUT THAT THE EXISTING

03:23:02.403 --> 03:23:04.438
PATIENTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT AND

03:23:04.505 --> 03:23:05.706
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS

03:23:05.773 --> 03:23:07.008
TO DISCLOSE TO THEIR PATIENTS

03:23:07.074 --> 03:23:08.976
THEY'RE ON PROBATION. WOULD NOT

03:23:09.043 --> 03:23:11.145
APPLY TO THAT DOCTOR. BECAUSE

03:23:11.212 --> 03:23:12.813
CURRENTLY CHRIS NEGLIGENCE NOT

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:13.814
ONE OF THE STATUTORY.

03:23:13.881 --> 03:23:15.783
REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE

03:23:15.850 --> 03:23:17.084
THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK IT

03:23:17.151 --> 03:23:19.554
EXPOSES A REAL GAPING HOLE. IN

03:23:19.620 --> 03:23:21.088
THE SAND AND I THINK THAT WE

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:22.356
SHOULD BE EXPANDING THE

03:23:22.423 --> 03:23:24.559
PATIENTS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT AND

03:23:24.625 --> 03:23:27.028
IN IN IN HAND SINK A TRANSFER.

03:23:27.094 --> 03:23:28.629
MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION HAS TO

03:23:28.696 --> 03:23:30.264
DO WITH AN INDEPENDENT ON THE

03:23:30.331 --> 03:23:32.767
OFFICE. AND THIS IDEA IS COMING

03:23:32.833 --> 03:23:34.135
FROM LOOKING AT OTHER

03:23:34.201 --> 03:23:36.470
JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE U.

03:23:36.537 --> 03:23:37.805
K. AND WENT TO AN INDEPENDENT

AND REALLY LOOK AT THESE CASES.

03:27:24.799 --> 03:27:26.233
BECAUSE THE FUNNY THING ABOUT

03:27:38.312 --> 03:27:41.415
BACKDROP WHY DOES THIS BOARD

03:27:54.094 --> 03:27:55.696
I'VE HEARD THAT AS WELL SO

03:27:55.763 --> 03:27:58.632
THERE'S DIFFERENT. BETTING

03:27:58.699 --> 03:28:01.035
PERCEPTIONS. BUT I WOULD LIKE

03:28:01.101 --> 03:28:03.537
TO QUOTE THE BASIS ON WHICH

03:28:03.604 --> 03:28:06.073
THIS BOARD IS FOUND AND THAT IS

03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:07.975
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

03:28:08.042 --> 03:28:10.110

REGULATORY AND DISCIPLINARY

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:28.229
FUNCTIONS. WHENEVER THE

03:28:28.295 --> 03:28:29.730

03:28:29.797 --> 03:28:32.533
INCONSISTENT WITH OTHER INTO

BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE

03:28:51.719 --> 03:28:54.188
STRUGGLE TO NINE. IN WHICH HE

03:28:54.255 --> 03:28:57.625
SAYS THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION IS

03:28:57.691 --> 03:28:59.360
ONE THING AND THEN DOES HE HAVE

03:28:59.426 --> 03:29:02.263
A LOCATION AND THE PRACTICE OF

INCLUDING THE PUBLIC. WE

03:30:02.890 --> 03:30:06.493

03:32:49.456 --> 03:32:52.659
THE GUIDELINES. WHAT EASE THE

03:32:52.726 --> 03:32:55.562
PROBATION PERIOD AND WE GONNA.

03:32:55.629 --> 03:32:57.064
IMPOSE ON. WHAT ASKING

03:32:57.131 --> 03:32:58.899
TROUBLING IN THE BACKGROUND

03:32:58.966 --> 03:33:01.802

TROUBLING. I HAD IT'S A IT'S

03:33:06.073 --> 03:33:07.808
JUST INTERESTING LET'S CHANGE

03:33:07.875 --> 03:33:12.713
THE WEATHER. THE BOARD USES. I

03:33:12.779 --> 03:33:16.783
LEGAL BAIL. IN OKAY TO PROTECT

03:33:16.850 --> 03:33:19.887
OFFICE AND WE KNOW NOW THAT THE

03:33:19.953 --> 03:33:21.788
REHABILITATION IS ON TALK AND

03:33:21.855 --> 03:33:24.758
IN PUBLIC INTEREST SOMEONE AS

03:33:24.825 --> 03:33:26.393
FOLLOWS AT THE LOWER LEVELS.

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:28.095
AND WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT FROM

03:33:28.162 --> 03:33:30.264
THE STATISTICS. AND MAKE ME

03:33:30.330 --> 03:33:31.365
BRING YOU SOME OF THE

03:33:31.431 --> 03:33:34.868
STATISTICS EVERY CASE ID. ME

03:33:34.935 --> 03:33:36.937
PERSONALLY AB THE SEASON ON LAW

03:33:37.004 --> 03:33:38.472
CENTER AND ONCE THE OUTCOME OF

03:33:38.539 --> 03:33:42.075
THAT THIS SEASON I ASKED HER.

03:33:42.142 --> 03:33:43.977
IT'S MY PERSONAL INFORMATION

03:33:44.044 --> 03:33:45.012
I'M NOT SHARING THAT

03:33:45.078 --> 03:33:47.114
INFORMATION WITH ANYBODY BUT

03:33:47.181 --> 03:33:48.815
IT'S INTERESTING ALL CLOSELY

03:33:48.882 --> 03:33:51.785
RESEMBLES THE TOPLINE NUMBERS

03:33:51.852 --> 03:33:54.254
WITHIN THE SPORT. I DON'T GO TO

03:33:54.321 --> 03:33:57.090
THEM QUICKLY. BUT BEFORE I DO

03:33:57.157 --> 03:34:00.194
THAT SOMETHING POPPED OUT AT ME

03:34:00.260 --> 03:34:02.930
A QUESTION WAS AKED ABOUT. THE

03:34:02.996 --> 03:34:05.432
BOARD MEMBER COMPOSITION. AND

03:34:05.499 --> 03:34:07.768
NOBODY FROM THE BOARD NO ONE

03:34:07.834 --> 03:34:10.837
ANSWERED IT. WE WAS SAYING THEY

03:34:10.904 --> 03:34:12.506
WERE SEVEN AUTHORIZED MEMBERS

03:34:12.573 --> 03:34:14.942
OF THE BOARD WE WAS SAYING GET

03:34:15.008 --> 03:34:16.543
OUT OF THE EAST THERE WAS SIX

03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:17.544
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SO LET ME

03:34:17.611 --> 03:34:20.948
JUST HEAR THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A

03:34:21.014 --> 03:34:23.984
SMALL THING BUT IT'S A SYMPTOM

03:34:24.051 --> 03:34:25.018
OF A BIGGER PROBLEM. AND A

03:34:25.085 --> 03:34:26.853
PROBLEM THAT IS CONSISTENT.

03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:29.723
IT'S A LITTLE MISSION. RIGHT

03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:31.225
LET ME GIVE YOU THE FACTS ABOUT

03:34:31.291 --> 03:34:33.760
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I

03:34:33.827 --> 03:34:36.730
WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING I WENT

03:34:36.797 --> 03:34:41.802
TO GO LOOK FOR THOSE NUMBERS.

03:34:41.868 --> 03:34:44.605
TWENTY THE THING. IT WAS SIX

03:34:44.671 --> 03:34:46.707
DOCTOR MEMBERS ON THIS BOARD

03:34:46.773 --> 03:34:48.208
WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THIS

03:34:48.275 --> 03:34:49.476
COMMITTEE AND THEY WERE FULL

03:34:49.543 --> 03:34:51.912
PUBLIC MEMBERS A DOCTOR

03:34:51.979 --> 03:34:56.750
MAJORITY BOARD. IN TWENTY

03:34:56.817 --> 03:34:57.584
SIXTEEN SO THE FOLLOWING YEAR

03:34:57.651 --> 03:34:59.019
OFF THAT THAT MAKES SENSE OF

03:34:59.086 --> 03:35:02.089
THE REVIEW THERE WAS A DOCTOR'S

03:35:02.155 --> 03:35:05.892
AND SIX MEMBERS. AND NOW THIS

03:35:05.959 --> 03:35:08.795
YEAR AT SUNSET REVIEW. THEY ALL

03:35:08.862 --> 03:35:10.897
EIGHT MEMBERS TALK TO MEMBERS

03:35:10.964 --> 03:35:12.799
AND THEY WERE FULL MEMBERS UP

03:35:12.866 --> 03:35:15.235
TO THE LAST BOARD MEETING THEY

03:35:15.302 --> 03:35:17.904
JUST APPOINTED ANOTHER ONE. IS

03:35:17.971 --> 03:35:18.538
AN INTERESTING IMPLICATION WITH

03:35:18.605 --> 03:35:24.044
THAT. BOTH PANELS ASIK UP IN A

03:35:24.111 --> 03:35:26.213
WAY THAT IS A MAJORITY OF

03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:29.549
DOCTOR MEMBERS. AND SO IF A

03:35:29.616 --> 03:35:31.318
DECISION THAT CAME FROM THE

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:35.022
DAG. AND ALEXANDER THE OFFICE.

03:35:35.088 --> 03:35:38.225
HOLES OUT OF THAT. GUIDELINES

03:35:38.292 --> 03:35:39.926
WELL WE ARE UNHAPPY ASK PUBLIC

03:35:39.993 --> 03:35:42.562
MEMBERS WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

03:35:42.629 --> 03:35:44.898
THE VOTES WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

03:35:44.965 --> 03:35:47.167
THE VOTES TO OVERRIDE THAT AND

03:35:47.234 --> 03:35:49.403
WE HAVE IN THE PAST WE HAVE

03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:52.072
DONE THAT SUCCESSFULLY FUNDED

03:35:52.139 --> 03:35:54.574
SAY IT CANNOT BE DONE. AND I

03:35:54.641 --> 03:35:55.642
WILL SPEAK TO THIS POINT A

03:35:55.709 --> 03:35:58.111
LITTLE LATER AGAIN. BUT FIRST I

03:35:58.178 --> 03:36:00.480
WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO. THE

03:36:00.547 --> 03:36:02.849
STATISTICS WHAT I FIND. AND I'M

03:36:02.916 --> 03:36:05.185
I'M SO CONFIDENT THAT WHEN YOU

03:36:05.252 --> 03:36:07.554
EXTRAPOLATE THESE NUMBERS. THAT

03:36:07.621 --> 03:36:12.893
YOU WILL GET WITHIN. FIVE OR 7%

03:36:12.959 --> 03:36:13.527
OF WHAT I'M GOING TO QUOTE HERE

03:36:13.593 --> 03:36:15.862
TODAY. AND SOME OF THESE KIND

03:36:15.929 --> 03:36:19.066
OF FIXING FONG. BUT AND I'M I'M

03:36:19.132 --> 03:36:21.101
AND I'M SETTING THE STAGE FOR.

03:36:21.168 --> 03:36:23.570
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING.

03:36:23.637 --> 03:36:25.372
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT. THE

03:36:25.439 --> 03:36:29.209
EXECUTIVE OFFICER USING THIS

03:36:29.276 --> 03:36:30.210
THERE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER

03:36:30.277 --> 03:36:33.714
SAYS THAT WE SET GOALS SET A

03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:34.748
SEVENTY NINE POINT 5% OF ALL

03:36:34.815 --> 03:36:37.284
CASES BUT LAST WEEK LAST YEAR

03:36:37.351 --> 03:36:40.454
WE DID 84% AND YEAH. IT'S

03:36:40.520 --> 03:36:43.223
NORMAL EVERYBODY DOES IT IS

03:36:43.290 --> 03:36:45.359
WHAT I KEEP HEARING EVERYBODY

03:36:45.425 --> 03:36:46.827
DOES IT ALL THIS IS ALMOST

03:36:46.893 --> 03:36:48.995
STANDARD WITHIN THE- WITHIN

03:36:49.062 --> 03:36:52.532
THIS COMMUNITY. YES IT IS.

03:36:52.599 --> 03:36:55.535
UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY BE TO.

03:36:55.602 --> 03:36:58.872
BUT IT'S HOW WE DO IT. I MEAN

03:36:58.939 --> 03:37:02.275
THE HOME WE FIND EVERYTHING. IF

03:37:02.342 --> 03:37:05.178
WE WERE SAID DURING THOSE CASES

03:37:05.245 --> 03:37:07.280
FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES I

03:37:07.347 --> 03:37:10.050
WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE. IF

03:37:10.117 --> 03:37:11.284
WE WERE SETTLING THESE CASES

03:37:11.351 --> 03:37:15.989
WHAT APPROPRIATE.

03:37:16.056 --> 03:37:17.691
REHABILITATIVE REAL

03:37:17.758 --> 03:37:19.760
REHABILITATE THIS INITIATIVES

03:37:19.826 --> 03:37:22.496
IN PLACE I WOULD NOT BE SITTING

03:37:22.562 --> 03:37:23.930
BOTTOM SITTING ON BECAUSE NONE

03:37:23.997 --> 03:37:26.767
OF THAT IS FALL IS AS HAPPY AS

03:37:26.833 --> 03:37:28.602
THIS ANYTHING. FROM MY

03:37:28.668 --> 03:37:30.904
EXPERIENCE MY BOARD MEMBERS MAY

03:37:30.971 --> 03:37:32.906
DISAGREE. SO LET ME QUOTE YOU

03:37:32.973 --> 03:37:40.680
THIS. AND THE THIS IS ALSO A

03:37:40.747 --> 03:37:43.884
KEEN. THE CALLOUSNESS THE YOU

03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:45.819
KNOW LIKE INDIFFERENCE WITH

03:37:45.886 --> 03:37:47.020
WHICH THIS NUMBERS ARE

03:37:47.087 --> 03:37:49.856
REPRESENTED. IS EVEN SO MUCH

03:37:49.923 --> 03:37:51.258
MORE TROUBLING BECAUSE I WANT

03:37:51.324 --> 03:37:53.093
TO GIVE YOU A SKETCH OF THE

03:37:53.160 --> 03:37:55.662
BACKGROUND OF THIS. WHEN YOU

03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:56.997
ENTER INTO A STIPULATED

03:37:57.063 --> 03:38:02.602
SETTLEMENT. I DOCTOR WALKS AWAY

03:38:02.669 --> 03:38:04.204
WITHOUT HAVING TO INCUR ANY

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:07.107
MORE ISSUES. REGARDLESS OF HOW

03:38:07.174 --> 03:38:11.144
GOOD HE JUST YOUR FINGERS. HI.

03:38:11.211 --> 03:38:14.381
UNDER THE TERMS OR THE PUBLIC

03:38:14.448 --> 03:38:16.283
THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE

03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:19.653
BEHAVIOR OF THAT DOCTOR.

03:38:19.719 --> 03:38:20.253
THEY'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY GET A

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:24.691
LETTER. AND THEY ARE LATEST.

03:38:24.758 --> 03:38:27.060
HAVING DID YOU CLOSE IS CUT

03:38:27.127 --> 03:38:29.229
SHORT BECAUSE NOW WE WANT TO

03:38:29.296 --> 03:38:31.598
SAVE MONEY NOW WE WANT TO GO

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:35.135
EFFICIENT OVER BEING EFFECTIVE.

03:38:35.202 --> 03:38:36.970
AND THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THE

03:38:37.037 --> 03:38:38.772
SYSTEM IS NOT DESIGNED TO

03:38:38.839 --> 03:38:41.975
PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IT IS IT

03:38:42.042 --> 03:38:44.411
BECAUSE OF BENEFITS RIGHT. BUT

03:38:44.478 --> 03:38:45.912
LET ME BRING YOU INTO THE INTO

03:38:45.979 --> 03:38:48.281
THE REAL FEELINGS THINGS THE

03:38:48.348 --> 03:38:50.817
STOP AND WE KIND OF AVOID. BUT

03:38:50.884 --> 03:38:52.919
IT CAME. HOME TO ROOST AT THE

03:38:52.986 --> 03:38:55.121
LAST BOARD MEETING. WHEN FOLKS

03:38:55.188 --> 03:38:58.124
CALLING FROM DISPLACED. I'M

03:38:58.191 --> 03:39:01.328
ONLY THURMOND PASS. IN THE

03:39:01.394 --> 03:39:04.498
HALLS FROM THE HOLIDAY BREAK.

03:39:04.564 --> 03:39:07.534
CHOLERIC OF NOT HAVING IT ANSYS.

03:39:07.601 --> 03:39:08.969
THE CRY OF A MOTHER WHO LOST

03:39:09.035 --> 03:39:12.105
THE DAUGHTER. A COMMA FOLLOWED

03:39:12.172 --> 03:39:15.909
WHICH WAS FEELING POWERLESS.

03:39:15.976 --> 03:39:18.111
POPULOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T

03:39:18.178 --> 03:39:23.083
PROTECTIONS AND- WE CREATED. NO

03:39:23.149 --> 03:39:27.454
ONE ELSE. I'LL BLOOD PANELS

03:39:27.521 --> 03:39:30.156
THAT MAKES THESE DECISIONS. WE

03:39:30.223 --> 03:39:32.125
CAN EASILY PUSH BACK WE CAN

03:39:32.192 --> 03:39:35.929
REVIEW CASES IF WE WANTED THAT

03:39:35.996 --> 03:39:38.431
SO IT WILL BE SO. BECAUSE

03:39:38.498 --> 03:39:40.133
EVENTUALLY ALL THE CASES COME

03:39:40.200 --> 03:39:42.269
BACK TO US. AND WHEN THEY COME

03:39:42.335 --> 03:39:43.503
BACK TO US THEY COME BACK WITH

03:39:43.570 --> 03:39:45.772
COMMENTS SO WE COULD GET BETTER

03:39:45.839 --> 03:39:48.208
WE COULD BUILD THE SYSTEM

03:39:48.275 --> 03:39:50.810
BETTER. IF WE WANTED TO. BUT

03:39:50.877 --> 03:39:53.813
THERE'S NO WILL. THERE'S NO

03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:57.417
CREATIVITY THAT I HAVE

03:39:57.484 --> 03:39:59.219
WITNESSED BUT WHAT THE EAST. IS

03:39:59.286 --> 03:40:04.357
CONCEALING. A CLOSED SYSTEM.

03:40:04.424 --> 03:40:06.293
SHUTTING EVERYBODY DOWN THAT'S

03:40:06.359 --> 03:40:10.263
WHAT HE IS SO BUT IT'S

03:40:10.330 --> 03:40:13.166
CONTINUOUS AUTO BETS. SEVENTY

03:40:13.233 --> 03:40:14.501
NINE POINTS PLAQUE WAS IN CALL

03:40:14.568 --> 03:40:15.802
OF THE CASES THAT EVERYONE DOES

03:40:15.869 --> 03:40:18.705
IT. LET ME GIVE YOU MY

03:40:18.772 --> 03:40:23.443
STATISTICS. HELLO TO ALL MY

03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:26.313
CASES THAT I DID LAST YEAR. IN

03:40:26.379 --> 03:40:29.482
THIS MAY INTEREST HIM AND DRAW.

03:40:29.549 --> 03:40:30.817
THAT FOR THE STIPULATED

03:40:30.884 --> 03:40:34.454
SETTLEMENTS THAT WE DEVIATED

03:40:34.521 --> 03:40:38.792
90% OF THE TIME. USING IN MY

03:40:38.858 --> 03:40:43.964
OPINION WEEK MITIGATING FACTORS.

03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:47.968
MISREPRESENTING FACTS AND- THIS

03:40:48.034 --> 03:40:50.503
ONLY ONLY SINCE AND CALL ME

03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:52.772
SINCE I'M GOING TO INDICATING.

03:40:52.839 --> 03:40:54.441
THIS COULD NOT BE INFLAMMATORY.

03:40:54.507 --> 03:40:59.512
BUT THE SENIOR SPENDING

03:40:59.579 --> 03:41:04.584
BENEFITS DOCTORS. END MANY

03:41:04.651 --> 03:41:07.954
TIMES WHEN I SEE THIS I I'M I'M

03:41:08.021 --> 03:41:08.521
TRYING TO THINK WHAT HAPPENS

03:41:08.588 --> 03:41:10.690
AND BACCHANAL. SO WHEN I PUSHED

03:41:10.757 --> 03:41:13.326
BACK ON TO THIS CASES INCOME CA

03:41:13.393 --> 03:41:15.128
BOARD LEADERSHIP IT BECOMES

03:41:15.195 --> 03:41:17.464
VERY APPARENT THAT THEY WILL

03:41:17.530 --> 03:41:21.901
LISTEN TO ME. BUT YOU ME.

03:41:21.968 --> 03:41:22.469
BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY REALLY

03:41:22.535 --> 03:41:23.503
GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:25.739
BECAUSE WE HAVE A FULL TO

03:41:25.805 --> 03:41:28.708
MAJORITY ON YOUR BOARD. AND

03:41:28.775 --> 03:41:31.311

THREE DAYS TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE

03:41:34.014 --> 03:41:36.583
I'VE LEARNED MORE SKILLS ABOUT

03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:38.218
PRESENTING CASES THAN I EVER

03:41:38.284 --> 03:41:40.754
TOLD I WOULD SIGN VERY GRATEFUL

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:43.723

STATISTICS HOW MY INFORMATION.

03:41:47.727 --> 03:41:49.663

REINS WITH THE BOARD'S

03:41:52.565 --> 03:41:54.501

03:41:54.567 --> 03:41:57.037
CHANGE FORMATION IF WE ASKED

03:41:57.103 --> 03:42:00.840
FOR RECALLS. DR A LOT- JIM IN

03:42:00.907 --> 03:42:02.509
THE WORLD ASK FOR HOW MANY

03:42:02.575 --> 03:42:05.078
TIMES DID WE ISSUE LETTERS OF

03:42:05.145 --> 03:42:06.713
PUBLIC CREEK FROM. AND I HAVE

03:42:06.780 --> 03:42:10.884
IT AT 40% OF THE CASE OF CASE.

03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:15.422
I DON'T 30% 240% THAT'S WE ALL.

03:42:15.488 --> 03:42:18.091
SO WE SET THE LITTERED MORE ALL

03:42:18.158 --> 03:42:20.593
OF OUR CASES BY PUBLICLY FROM.

03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:25.532
AND I. LEARN SOMETHING TODAY

03:42:25.598 --> 03:42:27.167
THAT IT INCLUDES ONE PATIENT

03:42:27.233 --> 03:42:33.540
AND TWO. SIMPLE THE POLITICS.

03:42:33.606 --> 03:42:34.174
THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:38.812
I'VE SEEN. AND I'LL LEAVE THAT

03:42:38.878 --> 03:42:40.280
TO ANOTHER POINT ABOVE THE

03:42:40.346 --> 03:42:41.815
PUBLIC REPRIMANDS IN THE

03:42:41.881 --> 03:42:43.883
BACKGROUND PAPER. THE BOARD

03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:46.519
QUOTED AND CAN BE A LITTLE TEAM.

03:42:46.586 --> 03:42:49.589
ONE OF THE THINGS. THE BOOK

03:42:49.656 --> 03:42:51.558
BOOK TODAY YEAH WE HAVE TWO

03:42:51.624 --> 03:42:52.792
HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE

03:42:52.859 --> 03:42:57.697
COMMENTS THREE YES. WHEN I DO

03:42:57.764 --> 03:43:00.867
THAT CALCULATION FOR THE S.

03:43:00.934 --> 03:43:01.434
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

03:43:01.501 --> 03:43:03.169
NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY I

03:43:03.236 --> 03:43:04.003
GOT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:08.374
FIVE. THAT'S A FEAT. IT'S A

03:43:08.441 --> 03:43:09.175
TEAM OF HOW WE PLAY WITH

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:11.344
NUMBERS IT'S A TEAM WHEN YOU

03:43:11.411 --> 03:43:14.447
PRESENT TOPLINE NUMBERS AND YOU

03:43:14.514 --> 03:43:14.981
DON'T REALLY GET INTO THE

03:43:15.048 --> 03:43:18.017
NUMBERS. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO

03:43:18.084 --> 03:43:19.486
TOO DEEP IN THERE SOMEONE ELSE

03:43:19.552 --> 03:43:21.554
CAN DO THAT. BECAUSE I'VE DONE

03:43:21.621 --> 03:43:25.692
ENOUGH OF THAT. IS ANOTHER

03:43:25.759 --> 03:43:29.529
INTERESTING TO STATISTICS OUR-

03:43:29.596 --> 03:43:31.164
WE CYNICAL PROBATION CASES

03:43:31.231 --> 03:43:33.933
AROUND 72% OF ALL PROBATION

03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:36.836
CASES. WITH A LITTLE PUBLIC

03:43:36.903 --> 03:43:42.342
REPRIMAND. TWO YEARS PROBATION

03:43:42.408 --> 03:43:43.743
THIRTY FIVE MONTHS PROBATION

03:43:43.810 --> 03:43:45.845
AND THREE YEARS PROBATION I'LL

03:43:45.912 --> 03:43:48.548
TWO YEARS PROBATION WE SET ALL

03:43:48.615 --> 03:43:51.184
THAT UP 90% OF THE TIME. SO 73%

03:43:51.251 --> 03:43:59.125
OF THE TIME. WE DEVIATE. 40%

03:43:59.192 --> 03:44:03.029
FROM THE GUIDELINES ON AVERAGE.

03:44:03.096 --> 03:44:05.165
SO JUST THINK ABOUT THAT THINK

03:44:05.231 --> 03:44:07.834
THINK THINK WHAT THAT MEANS

03:44:07.901 --> 03:44:08.434
THAT MEANS IN THE REST OF THE

03:44:08.501 --> 03:44:11.104
TIME. IN THE OTHER 27% OF THE

03:44:11.171 --> 03:44:15.375
TIME. THAT'S WHEN WE FOLLOW THE

03:44:15.441 --> 03:44:17.777
GUIDELINES AND I CAN TELL YOU.

03:44:17.844 --> 03:44:19.279
MOST OF THE TIMES WHEN WE DO

03:44:19.345 --> 03:44:21.581
FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES THOSE

03:44:21.648 --> 03:44:23.049
CASES NEEDED TO BE REBUILT.

03:44:23.116 --> 03:44:27.220
THOSE CASES ALSO AGREED JUST WE

03:44:27.287 --> 03:44:29.088
NEEDED TO TAKE A STAND BUT

03:44:29.155 --> 03:44:31.357
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE WILL

03:44:31.424 --> 03:44:33.359
TO REALLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC HE

03:44:33.426 --> 03:44:35.061
CAN SAY THAT ALL DAY AND ALL.

03:44:35.128 --> 03:44:36.296
WE CAN SAY THAT IT'S NOT

03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:38.464
PRESENT IN THE STATISTICS IT'S

03:44:38.531 --> 03:44:40.733
NOT PRESENT IN OUR BEHAVIOR AND

03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:42.869
GUESS WHAT THE PUBLIC TELLS US

03:44:42.936 --> 03:44:45.171
THAT ALL THE TIME. BY TELLING

03:44:45.238 --> 03:44:48.408
US THEY DO NOT TRUST US. YES

03:44:48.474 --> 03:44:51.010
THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA.

03:44:51.077 --> 03:44:52.946
I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT. WE

03:44:53.012 --> 03:44:54.280
DO NOT WE HAVE NOT AND THE

03:44:54.347 --> 03:44:59.285
TALKS. RECENTLY WHEN THE ALL

03:44:59.352 --> 03:44:59.819
COLLEAGUES WILL BE FOR THE

03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:02.055
SENATE. WELL CONFIRMATION

03:45:02.121 --> 03:45:05.892
HEARING SOMEONE WAS ONE OF ALL

03:45:05.959 --> 03:45:07.694
COLLEAGUES POINTED OUT THAT YOU

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:11.998
KNOW WE PAYING. THEIR DISPLAYED

03:45:12.065 --> 03:45:14.634
THESE FEES AND YOU KNOW. WHAT

03:45:14.701 --> 03:45:16.569
WAS ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS THAT

03:45:16.636 --> 03:45:18.938
THEY ARE IN STATE BOARD. BUT I

03:45:19.005 --> 03:45:20.440
WANT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING ABOUT

03:45:20.506 --> 03:45:23.476
A LICENSING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE

03:45:23.543 --> 03:45:24.077
I'VE DONE A FEW OF THOSE IN MY

03:45:24.143 --> 03:45:28.381
LIFE. A LICENSING AGREEMENT IS

03:45:28.448 --> 03:45:33.019
THAT YOU HAVE. QUIET PLUS IN A

03:45:33.086 --> 03:45:40.860
BRAND. AND EVEN. BIASED THAT

03:45:40.927 --> 03:45:44.998
BRAND IS BUYING THAT REPUTATION.

03:45:45.064 --> 03:45:47.066
AND FOR MANY YEARS THROUGHOUT

03:45:47.133 --> 03:45:50.370
THE AGES DOCTORS HAVE BEING.

03:45:50.436 --> 03:45:53.973
THE PREMIUM BRAND. IN TERMS OF

03:45:54.040 --> 03:45:58.511
PUBLIC TRUST WELL THESE A. WELL

03:45:58.578 --> 03:46:00.480
DESERVED BECAUSE THEY'VE ALWAYS

03:46:00.546 --> 03:46:04.384
DONE GOOD BUT THE HE'S VERY

03:46:04.450 --> 03:46:05.318
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

03:46:05.385 --> 03:46:08.454
DOCTORS THAT DEVIATE FROM THAT

03:46:08.521 --> 03:46:11.958
STANDARD. SO WHEN WE DO NOT

03:46:12.025 --> 03:46:15.895
FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES. WE

03:46:15.962 --> 03:46:18.631
DILUTE THE VERY INTEGRITY OF

03:46:18.698 --> 03:46:22.201
THE PROTECTION. THEN WE SAY WE

03:46:22.268 --> 03:46:25.171
CARE ABOUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT

03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:28.942
HOLD DOCTORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:46:29.008 --> 03:46:31.010
WRONGDOING AT THE LEVEL THAT WE

03:46:31.077 --> 03:46:33.112
CAN KNOCK IS MANY REASONS FOR

03:46:33.179 --> 03:46:36.282
THAT. I COULD SIT DOWN WITH OUR

03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:37.884
LEGAL COUNSEL AND WE CAN GO TO

03:46:37.951 --> 03:46:39.452
SECTIONS OF THIS LAW AND COME

03:46:39.519 --> 03:46:41.955
UP WITH NEW WAYS TO DO THIS

03:46:42.021 --> 03:46:44.090
THAT WILL AID THIS. AB

03:46:44.157 --> 03:46:46.359
SOLUTIONS BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD

03:46:46.426 --> 03:46:48.361
THIS CONVERSATION. AND THAT'S

03:46:48.428 --> 03:46:49.796
WHY I'M A CHRISTIAN. I'VE

03:46:49.862 --> 03:46:51.831
ALWAYS GET BUT JUST WANTED THIS

03:46:51.898 --> 03:46:55.368

THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT

03:47:04.911 --> 03:47:07.347
AS WELL. SO I WILL WRAP UP ITS

03:47:07.413 --> 03:47:11.184
