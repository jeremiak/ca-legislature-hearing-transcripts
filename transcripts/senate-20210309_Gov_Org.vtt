00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.271
THROUGH MANY MANY MECHANISMS

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.672
BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.141
OF THE FINANCING SO I

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.009
UNDERSTAND THAT AND- I'D LIKE.

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:54.712
MY SENTIMENT IS TO TRY TO. GIVE

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.447
THE- AUTHORITY TO WORK ON SOME

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.114
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.415
BEEN RAISED BUT I DO HAVE. I DO

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:01.318
I DO WANT TO JUST STATE MY

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:01.919
PHILOSOPHICAL CONCERN I'D LOVE

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.687

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:10.060
WAY THE FUTURE OF FOR FUTURE

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:12.429
DEVELOPMENTS- YOU KNOW WHAT

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:13.764
WHAT WHAT IS THIS WHERE WHERE

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:14.565
WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE I

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:16.166
MEAN DO WE THE PROJECTS HAVE TO

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.801
BE ATTACHED TO A STADIUM IN

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:20.337
ORDER TO. GET THIS TYPE HOUSE

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:23.173
EXEMPTION IN THEFUTURE. AND IS

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.308
AGAIN- OF YOU KNOW IS IT DOES

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.542
HAVE TO BE A BILL THAT'S THE

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.810
PROJECT IT'S LARGE ENOUGH TO

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.412
ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM.

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.314
SACRAMENTO INTEREST SERVICE

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.683
MEMBERS LEGISLATURE HOW HOW HOW

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.451
SHOULD WE BE. OUR THINKING

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:35.920
PHILOSOPHICALLY ABOUT A BILL

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:38.622
LIKE THIS- WHICH ISN'T IT WHICH

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:40.257
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND HIGHLY

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.725
REASONABLE IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.627
BUT I THINK THAT THE PRIMARY

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.562
CONCERN YOU'RE HEARING IS THE-

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:47.264
THE PRESIDENT MAY SET AND HOW

WITH WITH ONE DEVELOPMENT ONE

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:04.014
PROJECT AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.016
ANSWER IS THAT IS EACH PROJECT

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.351
COMES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.986

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.588
HOW BROAD THE EXEMPTIONS IS

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:15.592

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.109
WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN VOTE NOW

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.944

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.214
EACH ONE OF THESE HAS TO BE

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.582

FORTY IDENTIFIES THAT SB FORTY

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.608
WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO EVADE

FRUSTRATING THE LICENSE HOLDERS

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:29.755
I HAVE WITNESSED FIRST HAND IN

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:31.557

STATE LAW. IT'S MY STRONG

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:30.249
BELIEF THAT HAVING THESE

RATHER THAN ALCOHOL RESTAURANT

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:38.657
LICENSE MAKES LITTLE SENSE. NOT

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:39.892
ONLY ARE THESE LICENSES

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:41.327
REQUIRED TO WASTE VALUABLE TIME

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:43.429
AND RESOURCES IN BREWERY BEER

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:44.663
THEY HAVE LITTLE INTEREST IN

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.665
BREWING. BUT THE DEPARTMENT ABC

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:49.234
IS WASTING VALUABLE RESOURCES

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:51.537
ENSURING THAT THEY MAY- THAT

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.639
THEY'RE KEEPING IN COMPLIANCE

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:57.543
WITH STATE LAW. MY BILL SB TWO

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:58.110
NINE EIGHT WOULD ALLOW THESE

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:59.311
