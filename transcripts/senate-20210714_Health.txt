THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL ATTENTION TO THIS BILL AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. AND I'M PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY ONE AS SMALL RESTAURANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT THIS BODY FACILITATES EXPANDED OUTDOOR DINING FOOD PREPARATION AND SERVICE OPTION. IN THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN A. B. C. TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED REGULATORY RELIEF. TO SUPPORT STRUGGLING RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE. NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUT TOO MANY OF THEM ARE BARELY HANGING ON BY A THREAD. OUTDOOR DINING OFFERS A LIFELINE IN AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. TO ENCOURAGE RESTAURANTS TO RE DISCOVER NEW USES FOR THEIR OWN SPACE. AS WE CONTINUE RE OPENING OUTDOOR DINING IS LIKELY TO BE CRITICAL FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. AN ABC SIXTY ONE INTEREST CALIFORNIA FULLY SUPPORTS OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND I WILL SAY. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WITH THREE. VERY YOUNG. UNVACCINATED CHILDREN OUTDOOR DINING IS CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR FAMILY'S PLAN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO. WE ARE PROUD OF THIS BILL WE'RE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION ON THIS EFFORT. AND HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. R. MATT SUTTON THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. AND MADELINE ALFANO THE OWNER OF MARIA'S ITALIAN KITCHEN WHERE MY WIFE AND KIDS HAD DINNER ON MONDAY NIGHT IN ENCINO AND- MADELINE I'M SORRY FOR THE MESS THAT THEY MADE. WITHOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GABRIEL APPRECIATE YOU ARE WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WILL BEGIN WITH WHAT BUT THIS IS A FORCE.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS MATT SUTTON WITH CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE SPONSOR. OF THE LEGISLATION AND HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE SEEN IF NOT EXPERIENCE MANY OF THESE NEW REINVENTED OUTDOOR DINING SPACES THROUGHOUT. YOUR DISTRICT'S AB SIXTY ONE IS REALLY ABOUT CONTINUING THOSE. FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF TIME. AS THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. BEGINS THE LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY. WHAT THE BILLS TO. DOES IS THE GLASS. ABC OFFERED- WHAT'S CALLED A TEMPORARY CATERING AUTHORIZATION AND THAT PIECE. ALLOWS FOR THESE OUTDOOR DINING SPACES YOU KNOW AGAIN AND REINVENTED SPACES SO THESE ARE NOT YOUR RESTAURANT PATIOS THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE ADJACENT TO RESTAURANTS. OR ANOTHER CREATIVE SPACES THAT CITIES HAVE OFFERED. THE KEY HERE IS A. B. SIXTY ONE ALLOWS FOR A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR RESTAURANTS. TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT SPACE WITH ALCOHOL SERVICES WELL. THE SECOND PIECE THAT'S IN HERE THAT I THINK IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE. DEALS WITH- THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL FOOD CODE ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY. AGAIN WITH THE IDEA THAT OUTDOOR DINING IS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY FOR MANY PEOPLE. INCLUDING THE REFERENCE THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MADE AND THIS PORTION ALLOWS A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR WHAT'S CALLED SATELLITE FOOD PREPARATION WHICH IS REALLY LIKE FOOD PREPARATION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE LIKE HAVING A COFFEE CART OR SOMETHING SIMILAR- YOU STILL GO THROUGH ALL THE SAME PROTOCOLS- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THOSE BARRIERS ON THE FRONT END AND SO. THERE'S COUNTLESS PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- ON THESE REINVENTED DINING PROGRAMS A. B. SIXTY ONE IS THE BRIDGE. THAT ALLOWS RESTAURANTS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC IN THIS WAY- AND TAKE SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE ABC WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO OFFER. AND EXTENDS THOSE UP FOR A FEW YEARS AS RESTAURANTS CONTINUE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE STRUGGLE WERE AND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB SIXTY ONE. AND LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND- OUR REASONING BEHIND THIS POSITION. AS OUR COMMUNITIES RECOVER FROM THIS MOST SEVERE HEALTH CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIME. THE EXPANSION OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION I SHOULD NOT BE OUR PRIORITY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE ALTAR AND OUR SHARED CONCERN FOR THE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SUFFERED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. RELIEF FOR THEM SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND VISITORS. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL A CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SUFFERS MORE ANNUAL ALCOHOL RELATED HARM THAN ANY OTHER STATE. OVER TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ALCOHOL RELATED DEATHS OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOMVISITS. FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE COSTS AND THIRTY FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL COST EIGHTY. THAT EQUALS NEARLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER RESIDENT FOR TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY FOUR CENTS PER DRINK. THIS ANNUAL CATASTROPHE OF ALCOHOL RELATED HARM HAS BEEN ACCELERATING OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. A NEW WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STUDY PUBLISHED JUST YESTERDAY. IN THE JOURNAL LANCET ONCOLOGY FOUND THAT ONE OUT OF SEVEN NEW CANCER CASES IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALCOHOL. INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED AT THIS TIME ON HARM REDUCTION. NOT RUBBER STAMPING THE EXTENSION OF COLD IT ALCOHOL DEREGULATION IN AB SIXTY ONE SUCH IS EXPANDED ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE SALES AND OUTDOOR DINING IN PUBLIC AREAS SUCH AS SIDEWALKS AND STREETS. WHICH BY THE WAY ALSO POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT ADA COMPLIANCE WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WHAT WE REALLY NEED OUR PUBLIC HEALTH% STRATEGIES TO REDUCE ALCOHOL AVAILABILITY AND CONSUMPTION TO BRING TRUE ELIEF TO ALL RESIDENTS AND THE STATE. NOT JUST THE BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION TO REMAIN PROFITABLE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE ON A. B. SIXTY ONE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU THANKS LINE. IT'S BETTER CARE WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL NOW THEN BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE QUESTIONS COME IN SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES SIR GONZALEZ. Q. TO THE AUTHOR HAPPY TO CO AUTHORED THIS BILL I KNOW MANY- I THINK YOU YOU DID THIS AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH GOOD INTENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES- CAN BETTER GET BACK AND RECOVER- AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE I'VE REACHED OUT TO MANY OF OUR OFFICES I'M SO GLAD TO SUPPORT AND MOVE THE BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE IF WE HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT TO DO SO. WHEN WE HAVE A COMMITTEE TO DO SO. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- YEAH WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE CAN'T TECHNICIANS. YET BUT- KEEP THAT IN MIND- ACTUALLY- SUMMER GAY BRO I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THE BILL- I CERTAINLY HEAR THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL BUT- I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR BILL IS SUCH THAT. WOULD PROMPTS- THAT IS- CONCERNS SIGNIFICANTLY ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY BUT THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS- BUT I THINK THAT'S FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS- AND CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF AN EXISTING- A SITUATION THAT- THAT THAT WE SEEN ACTUALLY. IN GENERALS HAD A MORE POSITIVE EFFECT IN MY MIND- THAT I'VE HEARD- IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY HELPING THE BUSINESS BUT ALSO. HELPING THE COMMUNITY AS WELL- YOU GET ACCESS TO- TO. THAT RESTAURANTS AND FOOD HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS E ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH A PANDEMIC IN CREATING A SAFER OPTION FOR PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH. SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER FOR HER SUPPORT- I WOULD JUST SAY ONE THING I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT TO BE TOTALLY HONEST MYSTIFIED BY THE OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW I AM. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT FOLKS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ORDER A GLASS OF WINE IF THEY SIT OUTSIDE. I AM AWARE OF A LOT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH THAT SAID FOLKS ARE MUCH SAFER FROM COVERED IF THEY SIT OUTSIDE SO THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH I THINK IS AN URGENT MARTY AND IN AND OF ITSELF. WOULD BE WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY THE MEASURE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND HARM REDUCTION IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THE OPPONENTS AIRPORT TO THEMSELVES. ON BEHALF OF SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN. THE STATE THAT ARE BARELY HANGING ON BY A THREAD FOR WHOM THIS OFFERS A LIFELINE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I BOTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GABRIEL AGAIN- ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM- WE LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING UP YOUR BILL UP FOR A VOTE. THANKS VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN BY SUMMER IN THIS AREA. I SEE IN HERE. SO JUST. GIVE US A MOMENT TO TIDY UP THE PODIUM. ALL RIGHT WELCOME. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND SENATORS AT LEAST ONE SENATOR RIGHT NOW A. B. NINETY SEVEN TO PROHIBIT. FOR A BIT THANK YOU. THREE NINETY SEVEN WOULD PROHIBIT A PLAN TO HEALTH PLANS BEGINNING OF. AB NINETY SEVEN WOULD PROHIBIT A HEALTH PLAN BEGINNING JANUARY TWO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO FROM IMPOSING A DEDUCTIBLE ON AN INSULIN PRESCRIPTION OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM DIABETES WHICH MEANS. FOR THESE CALIFORNIANS INSULIN IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A HEALTHY LIFE. HOWEVER BETWEEN OF INSULIN HAS INCREASED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO PERCENT. THIS IS THE SKYROCKETING PRICES UNATTAINABLE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS OFTEN CAUSING UNDUE BURDEN. ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND FORCING MANY WHO CAN'TAFFORD THEIR MEDICINE TO SELL FRESHEN AND LEADER BEING ADMITTED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICINE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. NEARLY 26% OF DIABETICS PRESCRIBED. INSULIN REPORTED COST RELATED UNDER USE LEADING TO POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND POTENTIAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT ARE EVEN MORE COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR JOBS THE STATISTICS WERE ONLY FURTHER EXACERBATED ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM CHIPPER. ANALYSIS APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF THREE CALIFORNIANS IN THE H. C. N. DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATED PLANS USING INSULIN FOR ROUGHLY 360-007-0050 PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM EXEMPTING INSULIN FROM INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES. WHICH CHIPPER ALSO FOUND A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT HIGHER COST SHARING. REDUCES APPEARANCE TO INSULIN AND LOWER COST SHARING INCREASES APPEARANCE TAKE INSULIN AND THAT COST SHARING FOR INSULIN IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO INSULIN IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. PROPONENTS OF MY BALL WILL BILL WILL SAY THAT EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL RAISE PREMIUMS BY OVER TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. BUT ACCORDING TO CHIPPER AB NINETY SEVEN WOULD INCREASE TOTAL NET ANNUAL EXPENDITURES BY TEN MILLION. OR ONLY ROUGHLY LESS THAN 1% FOR ENROLLEES- THAT'S LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR. TO GO FURTHER ACCORDING TO ACCORDING TO THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CALIFORNIANS SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO BILLION ON HEALTHCARE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TEN MILLION IS LESS THAN ONE HALF OF 1% OF THAT NUMBER. BY LIMITING COST SHARING FOR INSULIN A. B. NINETY SEVEN WILL MAKE INSULIN MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ONE THIRD OF THOSE WHO USE INSULIN ON STATE REGULATED PLANS DECREASE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES BY AN AVERAGE OF 50% DECREASE HOSPITAL VISITS THAT CAN INCREASE UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE TO CURRENT AFFAIRS OR WHATEVER FUTURE PANDEMIC VIRUSES MAYBE. AND DECREASE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL VISITS AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WITHOUT EVEN RAISING THE COST OF PREMIUMS BY A DOLLAR TODAY I AM JOINED BY DR FRANCISCO PO OF THE NATIONAL ADVOCACY COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AND MICHELLE LU CEO OF HEALTH TRUST.

THROUGH THIS WORK WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AT THAT. TIME CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO INSULIN. EXCELLENT CONVALLIS AS IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO ASK A STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANY RESIDENTS A PULL UP TO HALF OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD HOUSING FORCING PEOPLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT. PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE OR BUYING THEIR LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS MANY PEOPLE WHO FACE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR EMPLOYMENT OR NOT THAT HEARING TO THEIR CARE PLANS ARE AND THERE INSTEAD RATIONING THEIR INSULIN. WHICH CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO SEVERE HEALTH COMPLICATIONS AND EVEN DEATH. EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN PROVIDES A REASONABLE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING THE SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPACT OF DIABETES AND WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. BY INCLUDING INSULIN FROM THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS. WE'RE SO PROUD TO WORK WITH A FAMILY MEMBER NECESSARY AND MERICAN DIABETES. FAIL AND INCREASING COST OF INSULIN HAVE BEEN A CONCERN FOR YEARS NOW HELLO AND FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF COPING NINETEEN HAVE EXACERBATED THE RISKS ASSOCIATED. IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN THREE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES AND THE PREVALENCE INCREASES WITH OLDER POPULATIONS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THOSE WITH BOTH FAMILY INCOME. COVE IN NINETEEN MADE A BAD SITUATION WORSE FOR MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES WHICH IS WHY EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN- MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIVING WITH DIABETES.

AS YOU HEARD BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIAGNOSED DIABETES AND APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEED INSULIN TO LIVE. PLEASE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE BLOODIED OUTSIZED BURDEN ON EVERYDAY AMERICANS EVEN THOSE WITH INSURANCE. AND ONE IMPORTANT PHONE USERS ARE REPORTING THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD THEIR MEDICATION AT THAT STAGE. OR RATIONED DOSES TO PAY FOR OTHER LIFE ESSENTIALS LIKE RENT INCLUDING UTILITIES. BOEING WITHOUT NEEDED INSULIN CAN RESULT IN THE RAPID ONSET OF SICKNESS OR DEATH DURING THE PANDEMIC RATIONING OF DOES THIS KERRY INCREASED RISK AS STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE WITH DIABETES PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH POORLY CONTROLLED GROUP CALLED HORRIBLE. ARE INCREASED RISK FOR DEATH AND COATED NINETEEN. FIRST DEATH CERTIFICATE I FIND THEM THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S NINETEEN PANDEMIC WAS IN A PATIENT OF MINE WITH DIABETES- THE TUBERCULOSIS BUT YOU HEARD FOUND THAT EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN WOULD HELP ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS USE INSULIN FOR IN. PLANS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATED- EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN WOULD HELP PEOPLE WITH DIABETES BY EXEMPTING INSULIN COULD DEDUCTIBLES AND WILL PROVIDE FIRST DOLLAR COVERAGE ELIMINATING THE EXORBITANT COSTS WERE INFORMED PARTICULARLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PLAN YEAR WHEN THE DEDUCTIBLE LIMIT RESETS FOR MOST PEOPLE. IN LIGHT OF MY COME ABOUT. BETWEEN COLBERT NINETEEN DEATHS AND DIABETES MAKING SURE THE CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO AND HEAR THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THANK YOU HEARD THAT.

AGAIN TO APIECE TOTAL IT'S THE TWO IF YOU- LET'S ON TO THE MODERATOR SLEEPING ON NICK LOUISA FOR THE CAL ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- WILL BEGIN WITH NICK. NICK LOUISA'S. GREAT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- NICKEL RESERVES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS ARE. REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLYBILL NINETY SEVEN- I MEAN WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN ONE SENSE OF COURSE INSULIN IT'S A LIFE SAVING MEDICATION THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RELY ON DAILY- AND SADLY IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A HIGH PRICED DRUG PRICES. ON THE CRISIS THAT IF WE DO NOT ADDRESS. I WILL CNTINUE TO BURDEN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PUT PATIENTS AT RISK. REGRETTABLY THIS BILL DOES NOT HELP THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM. INSTEAD THIS BILL BY FOCUSING ON BENEFIT DESIGN. WILL DO YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE THINK. WILL RESULT IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ONE INCREASE PREMIUMS ON INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES EMPLOYERS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. AND OF COURSE THIS WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME AS WE'VE SEEN REMARKABLY LOW PREMIUM INCREASES ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. GRANTED IT THE OTHER MENTIONED THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILLS MODEST BUT WE CANNOT LOOK AT IT. IN A VACUUM WE DO HAVE TO CONSIDER THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER MANDATE BILLS. THAT CUMULATIVELY BE SIMULANTS HEAVILY INCREASE PREMIUMS ARE CALIFORNIA BY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. NUMBER TWO THE APPROACH TAKEN. BY M. A. B. NINETY SEVEN. EMULATED FOR OTHER DRUGS IN CONDITION COULD FOR OUR PLAN. DESIGNED OF. WITH FEDERAL RULES. AROUND BENEFIT DESIGN INOTES REQUIRE PLANS TO INCREASE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER SERVICES. NOW THIS OUTCOME COMES TO PASS- WE FEEL THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TELL POLICY MAKERS WHICH SERVICES WOUD SEE AN INCREASE. IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS IF THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION ENDS UP THROWING A PRODUCT OUT OF COMPLIANCE FEDERAL AND STATE RULES. THERE'S NO CORRESPONDING EFFECTIVE THIS PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD LEAD TO ANY REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF INSULIN MANUFACTURERS CHARGE HEALTH PLANS ARE THE PRECURSORS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. WELL IT IS BILL PASSES THE MANUFACTURERS ARE FREE TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AT WHATEVER LEVEL INCREASE THE PRICE ON EXISTING PRODUCTS AND- WE HAVE SEEN A CONSISTENT PRICE INCREASED. BY THE MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING A 55% AVERAGE RISE IN THE COST OF INSULIN SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN TO MINUTES ON AND HE'S PERFECT PRICES. ARE GREAT SO LIMITING THE DEDUCTIBLE DOES NOTHING TO HELP A LARGER PROBLEM IT JUST REQUIRES A COPY MADE UP OF ALL FOR THE BENEFIT DESIGN- IN THERE FOR THOSE REASONS. WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY YOU NOW LET'S BRING ON PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND- I THINK FORTY FIVE SECONDS. THANK YOU MR CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CRAFTED YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB NINETY SEVEN WELL CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED BUILD UNFORTUNATELY COMES ALONG WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN ARE THE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN REMAINING UNAFFECTED. BUT EUROPE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER INDICATED THAT THE BILL WILL COST IN FULL YEAR PREMIUMS RIGHT EIGHT HALF MILLION DOLLARS AN EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS WOULD RISE NEARLY THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY AS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTED AT THE BIGGEST PREMIUM INCREASE OF THE EXPERIENCE SMALL REMARK AS- WELL AS INCREASE ALONG MAY SEEM TOLERABLE IT MUST BE TAKEN IN CONTEXT NUMEROUS MANDATES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND COLLECTIVELY THEY INCREASE PREMIUMS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS. AND EMPLOYEES. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AVERAGE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE TWENTY PERCENT. BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY INDICATED AFTER JOB PAGE COVERAGE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE THE B. NINETY SEVEN ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE NEED TO REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT THESE MANDATES HAVE UNDERWRITING HEALTHCARE COSTS UPWARDS. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE A PIECEMEAL APPROACH IN ADDRESSING HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. THE ISSUE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED HOLISTICALLY RATHER THAN ON DISEASE BY DISEASE BASIS FOR THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN THANKS FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU- ONE OTHER ON TO.

HEY ERIN DRIVERS WITH THEY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN RESPECT FOR OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT LINE. MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU WE'LL BRING YOUBACK TO THE COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I WANNA THANK ALL. EVERYONE THAT CALLED IN- IN OPPOSITION AND OFTEN SUPPORT I THINK THIS IS A- VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO DISCUSS SOME DOUBT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR THOUGHTS AND- ON I DO. ACTUALLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE INCREASES I KNOW MAYBE NOT AS IT PERTAINS TO THIS BILL. BUT COLLECTIVELY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MANDATES- HOWEVER THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IS A SERIOUS ONE. I WAS ONE OF THE- CALLERS NOTED OF SOME OF THE- INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING TO RATION THEIR INSULIN. THEY'RE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH AND PAYING THEIR BILLS AND JUST. BASED ON THE COST OF INSULIN I THINK IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE. THAT THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH IS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS PAYING A BILL SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I ALSO WANT TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. I THINK THIS IS SUCH A LIFE SAVING MEDICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTED THE COST OF BRAND NAME INSULIN NEARLY TRIPLED BETWEEN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND- TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND NO ONE HAS TO. LEE- SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE MEDICATION I ALSO READ ANOTHER STUDY BY UCLA HEALTH WHICH NOTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS ADULTS NOW HAVE DIABETES OR PRE DIABETES AND SO AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER ALL OF US WHO MAY HAVE IT AND AGAIN OVER FOURTEEN OTHER STATES INCLUDING WASHINGTON DC HAVE ALREADY MADE ADVANCES IN THIS PARTICULAR ARENA- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE KEEP HEARING OF THE PRICES GOING UP AND I THINK THAT LIMITING THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR INSULIN WILL HELP SO MANY OF OUR- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STAND BEHIND THIS IT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP THOSE. CURRENTLY ARE NEEDING THE INSULIN BUT SOME OF US AT ME IN THE FUTURE- FALL YOU KNOW VICTIMS OF IT AS WELL SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ALSO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY CENTER LATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I WANT TO ECHO ALL OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY- COLLEAGUE AND ALSO I WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT CHILDREN WHO NEED INSULIN AND- AS A PARENT I CAN'T IMAGINE. HOW AWFUL IT WOULD BE. TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR CHILD'S LIFE IN DANGER BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT AFFORD. THIS LIFE SAVING MEDICATION AND CHILDREN ARE PRETTY MUCH BORN WITH DIABETES SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DID SOMETHING TO. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE HEALTH PLANS ARE COMING FROM BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE CANNOT CONTINUE. TO LET PEOPLE DIE FROM A DISEASE THAT OUT THAT WE KNOW IS MANAGEABLE WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN AFFORD THE MEDICATION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. S. C. NO OTHER- THAT COMES FROM THE FLOOR- SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS AREA AND- FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I ACTUALLY ONE ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS FOR MY TWO COLLEAGUES WHO ARE. CURRENTLY PRESENTS FOR YOUR- FOR THE PRESENTATION. I THINK THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR ME AND AGAIN I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I THINK. YOU'RE PUTTING IT FOR THE GOOD POLICY AND ALL THE REASONS THAT YOUR WITNESSES BROUGHT UP AND WHAT- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID RIGHT WE SHOULDN'T- THIS IS A LIFE YOU KNOW IN SOMEONE'S LIFE SAVING DRUG- THAT DEDUCTIBLE WHICH WILL BE ELIMINATING IN THIS. BILL IS A BARRIER TO PEOPLE GETTING ACCESS TO IT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO STOP NOT TAKING THEIR INSULIN. AND ENDING UP IN THE HOSPITAL OR NAMIBIA MERCHANTS IN THE HOSPITAL OR EVEN DYING AS A RESULT OF THAT AND I. REALLY APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS BEHIND THE BILL. THE I GUESS THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE AND WE HAD A SIMILAR BILL HERE THAT WE PASS OUT THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL. IS THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY DRUG OR CONDITIONAL WEIRD THIS IS ALSO THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE OTHER- CONDITIONS WHERE WE HAVE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT SIMILAR AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THE DUCK DOUBLE THE- PATIENTS CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY STOP TAKING THE MEDICATION THEY END UP IN THE HOSPITAL OR EMERGENCY ROOM. JUST LIKE- IT'S- WITH THAT WITH THE DIVING. SO THE DEFINITELY CHECK FOR ME. IS THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE. THIS THEY DEFINITELY NEED THIS THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION JUST BUT THEY DON'T HAVE DIABETES HAVE A DIFFERENT DISEASE AND- AND I DO KNOW THAT- THE- YOU KNOW THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TALKED ABOUT NOT HAVING A DISEASE BY DISEASE APPROACH ALL RIGHT- SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE AS WE PASS THIS BILL WE HAVE THIS AND THEN SOMEONE LIKE HAS ANOTHER DISEASE GROUP AND DON'T THEY OF COURSE NEED IT AND THEN THEN IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ITSELF BUT EACH DISEASE AND EACH SET OF DRUGS WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. CO PAY DEDUCTIBLE WHATEVER ITS INTERESTS THAT WE HAVE TO NOW WITH THIS KIND OF LIKE DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND THAT ALSO PERHAPS ALSO DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW WHICH DISEASES HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN BOUNCE YOU KNOW EFFORT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RATES OF YOU HAVE A DISEASE THAT'S EITHER RARER YOUR PEOPLE ARE- PERHAPS YOU KNOW IT'S MORE PREVALENT IN A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE PERHAPS A MINORITY GROUPS THERE'S A LET YOU KNOW THE POLITICAL WILL- THE ABILITY OF THE BILLION MOBILE ICE IS THOSE LAST AND SO FORTH SO THEY DON'T GET THERE BUT THE OTHER ONES TOO SO THAT I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT I'M FACING- I'D TRY PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS- WHY ONLY DIABETES I'D SEE I THINK IT'S QUITE EVIDENT MY DIABETES NEEDS IT GREAT SO I THINK THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S LIKE WHY ONLY DIABETES- WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR- BUT- CERTAINLY I AM NOT AND IT YOU KNOW I'M NOT ASKING MY COLLEAGUES NOT TO VOTE FOR THE BILL BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE IDEA COMMITTEE NEEDS IT RIGHT AND I WANTED AND I AND I AND I REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES SAYING THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE VOTING FOR THE BILL- MY ISSUE IS THAT. THERE'S OTHER. AS WELL. AS YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA. IT EASY LIKE THIS APPROACH AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT OUT WHO CAN'T MOBILIZE A BILL- HEARING SO DON'T THEY DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS. RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE- THAT WAS BEHIND THE LEGISLATION THAT I. AUTHORED BUT CERTAINLY HOPING TO WORK WITH YOU AND MAYBE THERE'S APPROACH WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS LARGER ISSUE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY FOR THE DIABETIC COMMUNITY BUT HOPEFULLY. ALSO BOTH YOU AND THE SPONSOR TO THAT IT CAN YOU CAN SEE WHY IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. IT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING BROADER- THAT SO THAT ANYONE WHO'S IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A LIFE SAVING DRUG LIKE INSULIN. LIKE INSULIN THAT NEEDS THAT. IT FOR OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL. THAT'S A STANDARD. THAT DAN ANYONE WHO HAS A CONDITION LIKE THAT WHERE THERE'S A TREATMENT THAT WOULD SAVE THEIR LIVES. WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF FINANCIAL BARRIERS. FROM THEM SO AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION- PCT ADVOCACY FROM THE DIABETIC COMMUNITY- AND- WITH THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIR FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS SPACE AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ALSO HEAR THE BILL PREVENTS THE BILL- AND FOUR IT'LL- MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEP. OF THAT I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE. I AND I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS AS WELL. SO I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON ANY OPPORTUNITY IN ADVANCING MORE- MORE CHRONIC DISEASES SO THAT- WE ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE- IF WE'RE DOING IT FOR ONE WE CAN DO IT FOR MULTIPLE ONES- IS THE REASON WHY I STARTED WORKING SPECIFICALLY IN THE DIABETIC. SPACE IS BECAUSE WHEN I AM AS MATIC. AND WHEN I SAW THAT I DON'T HAVE A CO PAY. ON SOME OF THE MEDICATION THAT I USE. AND I SAW THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN DIFFERENT DISEASES SOME CHILDREN ARE AS MATIC THEY DON'T. TELL TO SOME THINGS ARE BETTER AFFORDED TO THEM SOME KIDS ARE DIABETIC BUT THE SAME OPPORTUNITY DOESN'T EXIST FOR THEM I JUST FELT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND SO I WANTED TO MOVE THIS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT WITH YOU FOR THE PAST SOME TIME NOW- BUT THIS THIS IS NOT A REFLECTION OF ANY OTHER ISSUES I. AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST. MENTIONED THAT GIVEN ALSO WHAT SOME OF THE SENATORS HAVE SAID A PART OF THE CHALLENGE ALSO IS THAT- WITH A GROWING POPULATION OF DIABETICS WE ALSO I'M JUST TRYING TO ANTICIPATE. WHAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE AND IF WE CAN HOPEFULLY MAINTAIN. OR CONTAIN COSTS IN SOME WAYS THAT THIS WOULD BE ONE WAY THAT THE END USERS WERE PAID LESS SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND THINK YOU THANK THANK YOU SENATOR IS THERE IN A FORTUNE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE CAN'T- TAKE A MOTION OR TAKE IT UP YET BUT AS SOON AS WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM- POLICE HAVE A SCORE OF WE'LL DO SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. IS THAT SOME OF OUR- LORD YEAH HYSTERIA THAT'S WHAT THE PLEXIGLASS AND DOES HE RECOGNIZE YOU ALL RIGHT SO NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE EIGHTY TWO. TO EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD WELCOME AND. GIVE US A MOMENT TO TIDY UP THE PODIUM FIRST. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SO ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SURVEY OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS IN THE U. S. ONLY THAT THEY- THAT THEIR IDENTITY DOCUMENTS- MATCH THE PREFERRED NAME AND GENDER IDENTITY. POSSESSING ACCURATE AND CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS IS ESSENTIAL TO BASIC SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FUNCTIONING IN OUR COUNTRY. YET FOR MANY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE OBTAINING IDENTITY DOCUMENTS THAT MATCH THEIR GENDER IS A HUGE HURDLE. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTEEN SIMPLY ALIGNS THE PROCESS FOR UPDATING TRANSGENDER MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES AND THE BIRTH CERTIFICATES OF THEIR CHILDREN. BUT THE PROCESS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR UPDATING THEIR OWN BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THIS GIVES TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS. THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO OBTAIN ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS FOR THEMSELVES. IN THE CHILDREN PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY AND THEIR WELL BEING. OPERATED AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CLUSTERS VETO MESSAGE OF S. B. SEVEN FORTY ONE AND WE ARE WORKING ITH CD P. H. M. TODAY MINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED. ON THE LINE WE HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TOMMY MARTIN THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND AMIRA. HEALTH AND BUSH THE FOUNDER OF ALL FAMILY LEGAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH DECEMBER AWARD- LOW MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE TOMMY MARTIN FOR QUALITY CALIFORNIA AND AMIR HOSSEN BUSH FROM ALL FAMILY LEGAL WILL BEGIN WITH TOMMY MARTIN YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES TOTAL FOUR MINUTES TOGETHER. SO PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS TOMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. SPONSOR OF EIGHTY ONE EIGHT AND THIS IS A BILL ABOUT ACCURATE VITAL RECORDS YES BUT IT'S ALSO A BILL ABOUT AUTHENTIC LIVING. ABOUT PROVIDING THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE WITH DIGNITY SO I'LL BE BRIEF AND A MOMENT MIGHT COME IN AT THE NEAR I WILL EXPLAIN THE VERY REAL IMPACT OF THE BILL WILL HAVE ON PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN OUT BY THE DATA AS WELL AS- AWARDED MENTIONED AS- ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CORRECT NAME AND GENDER LISTED ON ALL OF THEIR IDENTITY DOCUMENTS SUCH. AS OVER ONE THIRD OF TRANSGENDERS FUNDING TO REACH THE NATIONAL SURVEY HAD BEEN ASSAULTED. I BELIEVE OR OTHERWISE HARMED IN SOME WAY SIMPLY FOR PRESENTING AN IDENTITY DOCUMENT. THAT LISTS THE NAME OR GENDER THAT DID NOT MATCH THEIR GENDER PRESENTATION. SO WE DO HAVE MORE WORK TO DO HERE AND IT STILL IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP. FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE GENDER RECOGNITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. BY SENATOR AND NOT PRETEND TO ANY ACTION. AMONG OTHER LAWS THAT LAID A FOUNDATION FOR ACCURATE AND AFFIRMING IDENTITY DOCUMENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WILL BE GRATEFUL BECAUSE I REMEMBER WARD FOR PRESSING AHEAD ON THE ISSUE RESPECTFULLY URGE. THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW LET'S BRING AMIRA HASS AND BUSH. USE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY IS AMIR. SHERMAN ALONG AND LOOK ANGELES COUNTY THE FOLK ON L. INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES FOR THE PART OF THAT PRACTICE I SAID. CLIENTS CONTAINING THE NAME AND CHANGES ALPHABET APPLE YEARS WORKING FOR LANES AND AN LGBT RESOURCE YOU CAN CALLED. FOR A DRAFT OF THE PROVIDED TECH ASSISTANCE FOR BILL AND NOT LOTS OF A OF THE G. B. T. FOR BRINGING THE IDEA FOR THE BILL I WORK FOR THE CLIENT WHO'S GOING TO AN AMICABLE DIVORCE SHE DECIDED TO TAKE BACK HER MAIDEN NAME AND BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND AGREED TO HYPHENATE THEIR CHILDREN'S LAST NAMES OF THE RESULT. HOWEVER WHEN SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD MODIFY HER OLDER CHILD BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO REFLECT HER HUSBAND'S GENDER HE HAD TRANSITIONED TO MALE BETWEEN THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST AND SECOND CHILD. ALL I COULD HELP HER WITH THAT IT WOULD COST MORE MONEY AND I COULDN'T GUARANTEE THE OUTCOME. SHOULD NOT MAKE THE CHANGE AT ALL AND HE HAS THE LOOK OF THE CHILD'S MOTHER ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WHICH I COMPLETED A NAME AND GENDER CHANGE FOR ANOTHER CLIENT ABOUT A YEAR AGO SHE RECEIVED HER COURT ORDER NAME AND GENDER CHANGE EIGHT WEEKS AFTER WE FILED A PETITION WITH THE COURT. BUT IT TOOK A LEGAL MOTION COURT HEARING IN EIGHT MONTHS OF ARGUING WITH VITAL RECORDS TO MENTOR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WHICH I SUCCEEDED ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO HIRE PRIVATE COUNSEL TO COMPLETE THEIR NAME AND GENDER CHANGE PAPERWORK. AND I HONESTLY DON'T THINK THAT OUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE A MOMENT COULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE WITHOUT THE ACTUALLY THE LAWYER FRANKLY I WASN'T EVEN SURE THAT I COULD DO IT AND I'M NOT SURE EVERYWHERE WE GET THE SAME OUTCOME. IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE COME TO APPRECIATE HOW VITAL ACCESS TO HOSPITALS AND VISITING HER SICK LOVED ONES AND- NO ONE WANTS TO BE DENIED TIME WITH A CHILD OR SPOUSE WHEN THEY'RE IN AN EMERGENCY AND ADDING THE EXTRA COMPLICATION THE FUNNY LOOKING BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH AMENDMENTS IN TWO PAGES. COULD LEAD TO CONFUSION ABOUT THE DISCRIMINATION AT WORST THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE AT LEAST ONE BARRIER BY ALLOWING SUCH DOCUMENTATION TO ACCURATELY REFLECTS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE'S NAME ENGENDERS. WITHOUT ADDING CONFUSION. FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO HOW THEIR LEGAL. AND GENDER- ON. OF THEIR- DOCUMENTS. NOT THE FIRST. THE FILM DO JUST.

THAT CALIFORNIANS RESPECT EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND- DID THEIR RIGHT. TO LIVE THEIR AUTHENTIC SELVES AND I THINK THAT- SOMEONE HIGHLIGHTED I THINK ON THE CALL- AND WE DON'T EVEN THINK OF THESE THINGS HELP DANGEROUS IT CAN BE WHEN YOU PRESENT- A DOCUMENT THAT DOESN'T REFLECT WHO YOU ARE NOW AND- IT PUTS THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND- I THINK THIS IS JUST.

THREE EIGHT NINE WHICH ILL CONTINUE TO AUTHORIZE A COUNTY TO CONTRACT FOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES WITH THE FIRE AGENCY AND TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TO RE WRITTEN SUB CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE AMBULANCE SERVICE WITHIN MY DISTRICT IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT PROVIDES NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES. TO NEARLY ONE MILLION COUNTY RESIDENTS UNDER A LONG TERM EXCLUSIVE OPERATING CONTRACT UNDER THIS CONTRACT THE FIRE DISTRICT PROVIDES AMBULANCE SERVICES TO BE SUB CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE WEST THIS PARTNERSHIP IS KNOWN AS THE FIRE EMS ALLIANCE. SOME THREE REALIZATION FOR A COMBINED FIRE EMS DISPATCH AND COMMUNICATIONS CENTER MANAGED BY THE FIRE DISTRICT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY AND OPERATIONS. AT CLINICAL QUALITY AND RESPONSE TIMES HAVE IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY AND SERVES AS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTIES TO BASE THEIR PARTNERSHIPS OFF OF AB THREE EIGHT NINE WILL INSURE THE COUNTY TO RETAIN THEIR ABILITY TO CONTRACT FOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES SO THAT THIS AFFECTED SUBCONTRACTING MODEL FOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE. TO BE A VIABLE OPTION IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE BOTH COUNTIES AND FIRE AGENCIES TO ADOPT A WRITTEN POLICY ON SUBCONTRACTING PRIOR TO ANY SUBCONTRACTING AGREEMENT AND TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS. FURTHER BY REQUIRING A WRITTEN POLICY PRIOR TO ANY WRITTEN SUBCONTRACT FOR THE COUNTY AND FIRE AGENCY THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE FOR WORKER PROTECTIONS SUCH AS REASONABLE COMPENSATION BENEFITS AND WORKER RETENTION TO JUST NAME A FEW I AM AWARE THAT THE LATEST SET OF AMENDMENTS DO NOT COMPLETELY ADDRESSED. ALL OF THE OPPOSITE SINCE CONCERNS WHICH IS WHY A PRINT WTH AMID. TO ADDRESS THIS MANY OF THEIR MAIN CONCERNS I DO REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED.

FY I GUESS BUT- PLEASE BEGIN. OKAY GOOD ALL. TO PANEL AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS VINCE WELLS AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONTRAPOSITIVE. PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWELVE THIRTY. AND ALSO CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS FOR DISTRICT VICE PRESIDENT. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK TODAY ON A. B. THREE EIGHTY NINE. A BILL THAT IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO MY MEMBERS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY BUT TO ALL FIRE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE FOR THEIR HARD WORK MOVING THIS BILL FOR. THIS FIRE ALLIANCE. FOR A SUBCONTRACTING MODEL HAS RESULTED IN NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR BOTH THE COUNTY FIRE DISTRICT IN OUR CITIZENS. OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF ANIMAL SERVICES HAS INCREASED ALONG WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ANIMALS IS DEPLOYED. IN CALL PRICES AND TIMES HAVE BEEN DRASTICALLY REDUCED. AND OUR RESPONSE TIMES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED. COURTS HAVE BEEN CLEAR REGARDING THE COUNTY. REGARDING THE AUTHORITY OF A PUBLIC AGENCY TO ENGAGE IN CONTRACT WITH OTHER ENTITIES PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FOR THE DELIVERIES OF EMERGENCY ANSWER SERVICES BUT RECENT ACTIONS BY EMS MAY THREATEN THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF THIS MODEL. TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED DELIVERY OF EFFICIENT ANIMAL THAT'S A PRETTY HOSPITAL SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AB THREE EIGHTY NINE CLARIFIESTHAT A COUNTY MAY CONTRACT FOR EMERGENCY I WAS SERVICES WITH THE FIRE AGENCY THAT PROVIDES THOSE SERVICES THERE WAS A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE COMPANY. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE WORKERS PROVIDING THESE SERVICES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR. AND AT A FAIR OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IS OUTLINED. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I HEARD YOUR ALBUM. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH AND THEN THAT'S- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE LOUIS BOUCHARD FROM THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT FOR ALSO IN ADDITION FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. AND. YOUR SHIP A LITTLE OVER TWO MINUTES A LITTLE- GET AFTER IT HAPPENED IN CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LOUIS BROCHURE CARD CHEAPER CONTRACT COUNTY FIRE IT IS MY PLEASURE TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTY AND OUR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE. PROGRAM KNOWN AS THE ALLIANCE. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE AND OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT AMBULANCE SUBCONTRACTING MALL IN OUR COUNTY HAS BEEN SERVING OVER ONE MILLION RESIDENTS. THIS MODEL IS FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA. HAS PROVEN THAT THE COMBINED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN SERVICE OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WHEN BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER ONE SYSTEM BRINGS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. THEN WHEN FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SERVE THEIR PUBLIC IN THE SEPARATE SILOS. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY NINE IS NECESSARY TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF SUBCONTRACTING FOR NOT ONLY OUR COUNTY BUT AS AN OPTION FOR OTHER COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE DELIVERY OF THEIR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES. WITH A MODEL THAT HAS PROVEN ITS VALUE AND ABILITY TO IMPROVE RESPONSE TIMES INCREASE DEPLOYMENT OF INDOLENCE RESOURCES. INCREASE CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND PARTICIPATE IN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF EMS DELIVERY. AND CONSISTENTLY EXCEED COMPLIANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OVER FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS. THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE DOUBT THE SUBCONTRACTING SHOULD BE SUSTAINED AS A MODEL FOR OUR COUNTY AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER COUNTY IF IT FITS THEIR NEEDS. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY NINE IS NOT A MANDATE FOR COUNTIES TO PROVIDE AMBULANCE SERVICES WITH THE SUBCONTRACTING MODEL. IT'S A LITTLE BITE OF CONTRACTING TO STATUTE AS AN OPTION THAT WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ANY COUNTY TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE IN RELATION TO THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR AMBULANCE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS AND SUB CONTRACTING HAS PROVEN ITSELF AS A VALUABLE OPTION IN THE DELIVERY OF EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES. THE URGENCY OF THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE STATUS OF SUBCONTRACTING FOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES. WE NEED TO MAKE SUBCONTRACTING AN AVAILABLE OPTION FOR ALL COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY MISTER CHAIR WE WILL NEED TO WORK WITH. THE COMMITTEE TO REFINE SOME LANGUAGE AS THERE MAY MAYBE SOME MINOR CONCERT. CAN IN THE BILL TAX. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. OF THIS BILL AND THE OP. TO SPEAK THE STAFF. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF A. B. THREE TWO ONE.

BUT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS AND THE SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. WE DO APPRECIATE THE IMPROVED LANGUAGE PERTAINING PERTAINING TO THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THE OTHER CONCERN HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR LETTER IS AROUND HOW THIS MODEL HINDERS OUR MEMBERS ABILITY TO BARGAIN OVER WORKING CONDITIONS. SUCH AS DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE UNIT OUR UTILIZATION AND THE T. RELIEF. UNDER THE CURRENT PRACTICE IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THE MODEL THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE AUTHORIZING. THE FIRE DISTRICT CAN IMPOSE OPERATIONAL CHANGES OUT RATE WHICH CUTS OFF OUR RATES TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE NOTICE FOR ME OVER THE IMPACTS SINCE THESE CHANGES ARE COMING FROM ABOVE THE FIRE DISTRICT LEVEL. AND NOT AT THE DIRECTOR'S LAWYER LEVEL WHO IS A PARTY THAT WE HAVE A CONTRACT CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH. THIS IS REALLY OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE. AND POSSIBLY PRESENT ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED PROPOSED. AND IDENTIFY A WAY TO MEET THE GOAL- IN A DIFFERENT. WAY THAT WE THINK IS LESS HARMFUL.

TO LET PEOPLE BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A PROCESS TO TIP FOR THEIR BODIES TO BE DECOMPOSED AND THEN USED AS ORGANIC MATTER IN- IN IN THE EARTH SO IT IS A PRETTY SIMPLE PROCESS BECAUSE UNTIL I GOT DECOMPRESSION TANK THE BODY WELL AFTER SOMEBODY'S A DECEASED AND OF COURSE THEY WILL THEY WILL MAKE THESE. WISHES KNOWN PRIOR- AND THEN IT TAKES A SERIES OF TIME IT JUST SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS OF THE D. COMPACT THAT DECOMPOSITION OF THE BODY- WHICH IS THEN READY TO BE TO BE SPREAD AROUND SO THIS- INNOVATIVE IDEAS SOME IT'S AGAIN IT'S ONLY A CHOICE- IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED UNDER THE BUREAU OF FUNERAL AND CEMETERY- AND WE HAVE WITNESSES ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH CARE AND TO THE COMMITTEE- I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR AND FUNERAL HOME OWNER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. GIVING MY FULL SUPPORT TO ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE OH ONE. THE MAJORITY OF MY CLIENTS AND CALIFORNIANS IN GENERAL ARE CREMATED. AND WHILE THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROCESS. OF BREAKING DOWN THE BODY AFTER DEATH. FIFTY ONE EYES AND BUREAUCRACY WISE. NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION WOULD WORK VERY MUCH. LIKE CREMATION. THERE'S A SYSTEM WE ALREADY FOLLOW AND FUNERAL HOMES. THAT I WOULD. THINK WOULD BE QUITE EASILY TRANSFERRED. TO NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCTION. AND FROM READING THE AMENDMENT. FROM THE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL BUREAU. THE RESULTING SOIL FROM THE PROCESS WOULD BE TREATED LIKE CREMATED REMAINS. AFTER CREMATION. THE FACILITIES WOULD BE INSPECTED IT MUCH LIKE CREMATORY. YOU WOULD BE SIMILAR PERMITS ETCETERA. AND I THINK THIS PROCESS WOULD QUIT. WOULD FIT. REALLY QUITE WELL INTO WHAT FUNERAL HOMES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALREADY UNDERSTAND AND USE DAILY. R. FOR WHY THE BILL IS CEMEX. FOR US FUNERAL DIRECTORS FIRST THIS PAST YEAR THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED EXTREME BACKUPS WITH CREMATORY RUNNING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND BURIAL NOT HAPPENING SOMETIMES FOR MONTHS. WE REALLY COULD HAVE USED ADDITIONAL METHODS OF BODY POSITION LIKE THIS WILL PROVIDE. AND SECOND OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES ARE SO IMPORTANT CREMATION DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE WHETHER FOR RELIGIOUS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. TRADITIONAL BURIAL ALSO DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COSTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES. NOT TO ORGANIC PRODUCTION IS ANOTHER OPTION FOR OUR FAMILIES ONE THAT IS BEING RAPIDLY ADOPTED FOR A CALMER CLEANER MORE PERSONAL END OF LIFE EXPERIENCE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR IPHONE.

EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT BY SOME MEMBER JOHN SAWYER. WELCOME GIVE US A MOMENT TO TIDY UP THE PODIUM HERE. ALL RIGHT WELCOME PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. REALLY THANK YOU TO COME THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THAT A. B. EIGHT FIVE EIGHT DOES NOT PREVENT HOSPITAL FROM DIRECTING HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO FOLLOW LEGITIMATE. NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND STANDARD OF CARE GUIDELINES THIS BILL ALLOWS HEALTHCARE WORKERS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE TO OVERRIDE A HOSPITAL ALGORITHM WHEN IS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE WHICH INCLUDES. PHYSICIAN APPROVAL AND ULTIMATELY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. WELL I RHYTHMS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL USED TO HELP DECIDE THE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT FOR MILLIONS OF PATIENTS A YEAR ARE RHYTHMIC BIAS AND SPECIFICALLY RACIAL BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY A WELL DOCUMENTED ISSUES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN RESEARCHERS STUDIED THE OUTPUT OF A WIDELY USED HOSPITAL ROBBERY THEM IF FOUND EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT RACIAL BIAS WHEN REFERRED BLACK PATIENTS TO EXTRA CARE PROGRAMS SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER THAN WHITE PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY CAN COMPLEMENT THE SKILLS IN DECISION MAKING OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. I HAVE HAD MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH INTERVENTION OF A NURSE SAVE MY LIFE WHEN I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. IT WAS A NURSE. AND THE ALGORITHMIC. THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE. AND THE DOCTOR ALL COMING TOGETHER TO GIVE ME A QUALITY OF CARE. THAT TOOK ME OFF OF INSULIN. AND CUT MY MET FOREMAN ENCRYPTED SITE IN HALF. IT IS THE IT IS THE COMBINATION OF ALL THREE THAT ULTIMATELY HELPED ME WITH MY HEALTH CARE. WE AT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE INCREASINGLY PASSED BILLS TO ADDRESS THE IMPLEMENT IMPLICIT BIASES OF INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE MORE INGRAINED IN OUR SOCIETY IS ONLY RIGHT THAT WE TAKE SOME SOME SOME THOSE SAME STEPS TO ADDRESS ITS LIMITATIONS AS WELL. MAJOR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE ALREADY RECOGNIZED THIS NEED AND HAVE INCORPORATED THE SAME RETALIATION PROTECTIONS THIS BILL IS CREATING. INTO THEIR OWN POLICIES ULTIMATELY WHEN WE ALLOW ALGORITHMS. DOCTORS AND NURSES TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE AND REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THOSE BIASES IN ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE WE WILL SAVE LIVES. EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT PROMOTES PATIENT WELL BEING IMPROVES PATIENTS QUALITY OF CARE BY PUTTING THEIR TRUST BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS PROPERLY TRAINED TO DO THEIR JOB. WITH ME TODAY. TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY OVER THE PHONE IS TAYLOR JACKSON ON BEHALF OF THE BILL SPONSORED THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. AND JANICE FORMALITY BUT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEITHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR JOHN SAWYER AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS. SO WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON TO- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE OUR LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AT TAYLOR JACKSON FROM CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND JANICE M. ALLEY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. LET'S BEGIN WITH TAYLOR JACKSON YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TOTAL FOR MINUTES BETWEEN BOTH WITNESSES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSORS OF EIGHTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT AND THANK YOU TO DR PAN AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH THAT. IDON'T REMEMBER PLAYER THAT IMPLICIT BIAS IS HUGE ISSUE IN HEALTH. DATA SHOWN BIASES INHERENT IN THE ALGORITHM USED IN HOSPITALS WHICH DO EVERYTHING FROM SETTING PRESCRIPTION PLANS DESIGNATING PATIENT ACUITY AND DETERMINING WHEN YOU'LL BE GETS CHARGED. EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT ENSURES THAT A NURSE CAN DISAGREE WITH THE CLINICAL ALGORITHM TO MAKE THE BEST TREATMENT DECISION FOR THEIR UNIQUE FEATURE WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT FROM THEIR EMPLOYER SOLELY FOR THAT POSITION. THE BILL ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER WORKER ENGAGEMENT WITH TECHNOLOGY AT THE-HOSPITAL. ASKING THAT WORKERS BE NOTIFIED WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTING THEIR JOB IS BEING BROUGHT IN. THAT WORKERS GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SOME INPUT ON WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS SELECTED. EMINEM'S LAWYERS PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. NURSES ARE ALREADY BOUND BY THEIR LICENSE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND REGULATIONS AND THEIR TIRELESS COMMITMENT TO THEIR PATIENTS TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND PROVIDE THE BEST CARE AND TREATMENT POSSIBLE. HOWEVER WITHOUT A CLEARLY OUTLINED RETALIATION. HEALTH CARE WORKERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUT IN THE POSITION FOR THE FACT HERE THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR THEIR PATIENTS. PUT THEIR JOB AND LIVELIHOOD ON THE LINE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHCARE WORKERS WOULD BE FREE FROM OVERSIGHT MONITORING OR GET SOMEONE CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG FEELING OUR LICENSING BOARDS THAT OVERSEE THEIR MEMBERS AND DISCIPLINE. BENT OVER ROW BOTH LIFE. WHEN APPROPRIATE AND THE FIELDS OF NOTHING TO CHANGE THOSE PROFIT. HOSPITAL WOULD ALSO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE A WORKER OR ENGAGING IN UNSAFE PRACTICES. I WOULD FURTHER NO CLINICAL ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES HAVE NO STATE OVERSIGHT PROCESS AND THERE ARE NO HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND HOW THEY ARE USED OR IMPLEMENTED. ON LIKE ACTUAL HEALTH CARE WORKERS. TREATMENT OF NEVER A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FORMULA AND THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WILL BE IN THE NURSE'S PRIORITY CAN REMAIN THEIR PATIENTS. FOR THAT REASON FEE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR. I. KNOW DONT EAT IT THANK YOU. THANKS FOR MUCH NOW LOOKS UP JANICE- MALLEY FROM CAL LABOR FEDERATION YOU HAVE A MINUTE FIFTY FIVE SECONDS. GREAT THANK YOU AND KERR AND MEMBERS- THIS IS JENNIFER CALLING WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WHERE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS PRESENTING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON MINORITIES TRUMP ACTION RATE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MORTALITY. MANY BELIEVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS TO GUIDE CLINICAL DECISION MAKING FOR THE NOVEL PROCEEDS. RESULTING IN A RAPID DISSEMINATION OF UNDERDEVELOPED AND POTENTIALLY BY MODELS. WHICH MAY EXACERBATE THE DISPARITY GAP. THERE IS HOPE THAT AI CAN HELP GUIDE TREATMENT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES WITHIN THIS CRISIS. HOWEVER SHOULD NOT LIMIT INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL JUDGMENT OR HEALTHCARE WORKERS ABILITY TO ACT AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE. ALGORITHMS SHOULD. NOT DETERMINE THE CARE NEEDED BY PATIENTS. GIVEN THE PERVASIVE OF BI I FAILURE TO CROSS TO COME. MITIGATION STRATEGIES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. RISK EXACERBATING EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HINDERING THE ADOPTION OF A. I. TOOL CAPABLE OF IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOMES. EIGHTY EIGHT HIGH BASED ON A PATH TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY OR ECONOMIC STATUS RECEIVE THE BEST CARE FOR THEM. AND PROTECT HEALTHCARE WORKERS FROM RETALIATION IF THEY REQUEST OVER A HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE. THE LABOUR SAID IT'S PROUD TO SUPPORT AT EIGHT FIVE EIGHT AM RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR VOTE ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANKS FOR.

PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU RAISE A RUNNY BIRD VERDUGO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE- RONNIE VERTIGO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS THAT THE ASIAN- WILL FEATURE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR- WE REGRETFULLY REMAINED FOLLOWS UNLESS THE MANDATE. TO EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT I REALLY DO THINK THIS IS A BILL WHERE WE CAN FIND A MIDDLE GROUND- HI REMAINING OUTSTANDING CONCERN HOWEVER WITH THE BILL- IS THAT THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MOVED INTO THE LABOR CODE- WHICH WILL UNNECESSARILY EXPOSED HOSPITALS TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION LITIGATION. OR WHAT WE ALL KNOW THE PART A LIABILITY OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AVE MANY PROTECTIONS UNDER EXISTING LAW- INCLUDED PROTECTIONS WHEN PROVIDING CARE FOR PATIENTS. HOWEVER AS IT RELATES TO POPULATE BILITY FOR SCOPE OF PRACTICE THE ISSUES- WE FIND IT INAPPROPRIATE AND FRANKLY A BIT UNPRECEDENTED ACTION MOVIES ISSUED OUT OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND INTO THE LABOR CODE- AND NOTED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- WE OFFERED SEVERAL MODEST AMENDMENTS ONE OF WHICH ONE OF WHICH WHAT YOU. POSSIBLY MOVE THE LANGUAGE INTO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE- WHICH WE FEEL IS THE MORE APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION ARE FOR WHAT THIS BILL THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY I FELT THAT THEY COULD- THOSE CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION.

WANT TO TRY TO BE SURE WE IMPROVE QUALITY AND- THERE AND DID NOT CREATE YEAH I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF ORIGINAL BILL EVEN WITHOUT THE AMENDMENT- BUT JUST A QUICK CLARIFICATION ON THAT POINT. SO I DO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH ME ON THAT- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO ALSO RESPECT THE PROFESSIONAL TANAMI OF SOCIETY'S PROFESSIONALLY HELP PROFESSIONALS. THAT WHICH REALLY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO WE'VE EVER- WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR CORN FOR THAT BUT THANKS SO MUCH FOR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER TEN EIGHTY FIVE SO JUST REMINDED I AM NUMBER NINES ON CONSENT ITEM NUMBER TEN EIGHTY FORTINO SEVEN BY SOME MEMBER BURKE. WELCOME THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS MEASURE AND I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO STREAMLINE. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEW GRADUATES IN THE PERINATAL NURSES AND TO ALSO CLARIFY THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT FOR LICENSEE WITHIN THEIR FIRST TWO YEARS OF LICENSURE. AB FORTINO SEVEN SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REQUIRES NURSING PROGRAMS AND HOSPITALS TO INCLUDE IMPLICIT BIAS EDUCATION FOR NURSES THAT WILL HELP BRING EXISTING DISPARITIES AND NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES TO AN END. EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LEADS TO DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF CARE GIVEN TO PATIENTS. THE EVIDENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE THE ONES TO BE. SENT TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS BIAS. IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING DECISIONS AFFECTED BY THIS BIAS CAN HAVE LIFE AND DEATH IMPLICATIONS AS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF THROUGHOUT SUBTLEDIFFERENCES IN HOW HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INTERACT WITH PATIENTS OR DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH CARE TREATMENTS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND MUST BE ADDRESSED. EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THERE IS DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT BY THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND EDUCATORS TOWARDS MITIGATING NEGATIVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. THESE EFFORTS MUST CONTINUE IF WE WERE TO MAKE STRIDES TOWARD ADDRESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STATES MANY DIVERSE POPULATION. EIGHTY FORTINO SEVEN WILL BROADEN THESE EFFORTS BRINGING AWARENESS TO THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR NURSES IN OUR STATE AND ANOTHER STEP. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARD MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. THIS MEASURE PASSED OFF OF SIMPLY FOR WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. VOTE IN SUPPORT OVER THE PHONE IT'S CURTIS LANE WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. RIGHT THANKS SO MUCH AS A MEMBER BURKE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THE CANADIAN TAKING AMENDMENTS. WE'LL PUT IT BACK IN WITH- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FORTINO SEVEN SO PLEASE BRING OUR MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE CURTIS LANE FOR THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO PRESENT. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S LOCATION PROBLEM SPONSORS OF AB FOURTEEN OH SEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR ALSO AND COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL- IF YOU COULD BUY IT EXISTS AMONG PEOPLE ALL PROFESSIONS. HOWEVER WHEN IMPLICIT BIAS PERSISTS AND HEALTHCARE SETTING IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY MEMBERS OF RACIAL. ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS. THE PREVALENCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE SETTING IN RESPECT OF THE INADEQUACIES. WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND STRUCTURE. TOO OFTEN THE THIRTY FAILED TO LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. THOSE COMMUNITIES NEEDS. AND THEIR RESOURCES. OPPORTUNITIES NEED TO TAP TO FILL THOSE NEEDS. HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND EDUCATORS MUST DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT. TO ENDING RACIAL.

RIGHT WELCOME PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS SO I YOU WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE. AS REFLECTED IN THE MOCK UP THAT WAS CIRCULATED BY THE COMMITTEE. THE AMENDMENTS NO LONGER CLASSIFIED DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS BUSINESSES AS PROVIDERS OF HEALTH CARE. BUT INSTEAD OF REQUIRED THEM TO GET WRITTEN CONSENT. FROM THE CONSUMER PRIOR TO SHARING THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. I THANK THE CHAIR AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE SOUTH FOR A WORKING WITH MY TEAM. A DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE GIVING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE A DIGITAL I AND MOBILE CONNECTED INHALER. CAN DETECT WHEN A DEVICE IS USED TO MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF THE USER'S INTERPOLATION AND TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO THE- USERS DR. ALSO SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ARE ALREADY IN USE. THESE PILLS CAN RECORD THE TIME IN QUANTITY. A DRUG IS TAKEN A PERSON'S TEMPERATURE. ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE. AND WOULD UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BE PROTECTED UNDER CLIA AND HIPAA. HOWEVER FOR DATA TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION. IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. INFORMATION GENERATED OR COLLECTED AT A PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT BE CAPTURE. UNDER A MEDICAL PRIVACY LAWS. FURTHERMORE THIS KIND OF PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED BY BUSINESSES. AND OFTEN TIMES SHARE WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES. WITHOUT THE USERS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. FOR EXAMPLE A TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY INDICATED THAT CERTAIN DEPRESSION AND SMOKING CESSATION APPS SHARE INFORMATION WITH FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE. THAT COULD BE USED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES. AND DIFFERENT IT'S A SCENARIO AND ENSURE A BOUGHT HEALTH RELATED DIGITAL DATA OF ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE FROM A DATA AGGREGATOR. THE BOTTOM LINE IS EXISTING LAWS DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF MEDICAL APP USERS. AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION THEY COLLECT UNDER C. M. I. A. BY PROHIBITING. ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN APPLE. DEVICE FROM SELLING OR SHARING THAT USERS HEALTH DATA WITHOUT THEIR WRITTEN CONSENT. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA IS TREATED THE SAME WAY AS OUR DATA GENERATED IN A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING. I HAVE A ONE WITNESS TO TESTIFY ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANKS VERY MUCH- SUMMER CHILD AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- SO I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- THERE TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES SO WE WILL ALLOW YOUR ONE LEAD- SUPPORTING WITNESS TO HAVE UP TO FOUR MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY SO. MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE MAUREEN MAHONEY FROM CONSUMER REPORTS YOU HAVE. UP TO FOUR MINUTES TO PRESENT TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS. WE SUPPORT AT FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX BECAUSE IT WOULD EXTEND THE EXISTING STRONG HEALTH PRIVACY LAW CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT. THE SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION GENERATED BY NEW FORMS OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY. STRONG PROTECTIONS OVER THIS INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE CONSUMER PROTESTING HAVE FOUND THAT MENTAL HAVE HELPED OUT SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WITH TECH COMPANIES ATTRACTOR BEHAVIOR ACROSS OTHER APPS. THAT INFORMATION CAN BE COMBINED WITH OTHER DATAAND USED TO TARGET ADS TO YOU BASED pHEALTH STATUS AND DOWN THE ROAD IT COULD BE OBTAINED BY OTHER THIRD PARTIES AND USED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW. CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THAT DATA MIGHT BE SHARED OR MISUSE. ANALYSTS TRUE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT ARE YOU PRICES DATA. THE LAW IS NOT A STRONG FOR EXAMPLE THE TCPA ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO STOP THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT THE CMA BY THE FALL PROHIBITS MOST PIECES OF SHARING AT ALL IN CONSUMER REPORTS TESTING AGAIN FOUND THAT CONSUMERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY UP TOGETHER STILL THERE INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA. SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY WEAKER SET OF LAWS JUT BECAUSE IT'S COLLECTED BY AN ONLINE SERVICE OR OTHER NEW. TECHNOLOGY WITH RESPECT BETWEEN THE MEMBERS WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THOSE WE NEED A BIT MORE TIME TO EVALUATE BUT WE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK ON THE BILL AND URGE YOU TO KEEP THE BALL MOVING FOR TODAY'S WERE.

OVERBROAD WITH UNCLEAR DEFINITIONS AND DISMISSES THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PASSED BY VOTERS LAST NOVEMBER IN PREPARATION FOR AN OLDER STATUTE. THAT IS ILL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THIS INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH THE STATE IS ALREADY GOVERNED BY FIFTY. AND CPR EIGHTY FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX TAKE THE DATA OUT OF THE EXISTING PRIVACY FRAMEWORK AND PLACES IT IN A WHOLLY DIFFERENT CODE SECTION THAT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO HANDLE CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY. THIS DISRUPTION TO EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW IN THE PRIVACY FRAMEWORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND VOTERS PASSED AGAIN TWENTY TWENTY OVER COMPLICATE AN ALREADY COMPLEX AREA FIRST IMPRESSION. AND SHE'S NO BENEFICIAL OUTCOME FOR CONSUMERS G. P. AND G. P. R. A. OR SO NEW IN FACT THAT MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF CPR AND NOT EVEN TAKEN EFFECT YET. AND THE DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCT INDUSTRY IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTING VERY CONSERVATIVELY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO BUILDING OUT COMPLEX COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS WITH LAWYERS. STAFF AND VARIOUS INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES DESIGNED TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER REQUESTS. UNDER THE NEWLY ADOPTED CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ACCORDINGLY WE LOCATING SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DOES. MAKING SWEEPING CHANGES TO A BRAND NEW PRIVACY LAW AND DISRUPTING COMPLIANCE EFFORTS SO SIGNIFICANTLY MAKES LITTLE SENSE PARTICULARLY WHEN NOTING THAT CONSUMERS CURRENTLY ENJOY THE EXACTING RIGHT. UNDER C. P. AND C. P. R. A. THOSE ARE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE TAYLOR SHARING OF INFORMATION AND THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THEIR INFORMATION. LIKE HAT CONSUMERS MAY EXERCISE TODAY UNDER EXISTING LAW TODAY. THE LAWS UNDER WHICH CONSUMERS CAN EXERCISE THESE RIGHTS ARE NOT OLD OR OUTDATED. THEY WERE PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AGAIN TWENTY TWENTY BY BALLOT MEASURE. AND A SECURE FOR CONSUMERS THEACTING PROTECTIONS THAT THIS BILL REPLICATE. MINING DIVISIONS WITH THE OVERALL NATURE OF THE BILL DROPPING AS NOTING AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS MAKE THIS BILL DESTRUCTIVE NOT JUST CONFUSING. FOR EXAMPLE AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM THE RAMIFICATIONS. OF SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION ARE STILL ON CLEAR.

AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT WE JUST PASSED THE COMPANY PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT IN THE BAMBERG REGULATES ALL THIS INFORMATION CLEARLY. IT'LL HELP TO THE NEW AND EVOLVING AREA HOLDS TREMENDOUS PROMISE FOR PATIENTS CONTROL THEIR HEALTH AND FOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS EIGHT BILLION. BUT THIS REMAINS A NAGEL AS INVOLVING CONCEPT OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS DURING THE BREEZE OF COURSE THIS IS WHAT WE THINK OF ITS TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE AND THE SENSITIVITY COMES WITH IT. FITNESS APPS WORKOUT TRACKER APPS IN THE GYM PERSONAL NOTES ABOUT AN INJURY A PERSONAL DIARY THAT INCLUDES FEELINGS ABOUT DEPRESSION ANXIETY. UNDER THIS BILL COVERS ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO A PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CONDITION THIS COVERS A VAST ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HERE IT'S EQUALLY FAST. IS HE NOW SAYS RAY RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION ARE UNCLEAR AND WHY WOULD WE GO IN THIS DIRECTION CALVARY PRICE RIGHT THAT COVERS ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION REQUIRING AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN FOR NEWS. AND CREATE A WHOLE NEW SET OF OBLIGATIONS FINALLY AT THE HHS FOR STUDYING THESE ISSUES WERE VERY LIKELY TO PROPOSE NEW REGULATIONS CORPORATE FIFTY APPLICATIONS WE OFTEN SAY THAT C. M. I. A. AS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST WHAT HAPPENED BUT THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD RECEIVE BY. FAR BEYOND THE SCOPE OF HIP- GREAT HARMFUL DIVERGENCE IN THE SPACE OF A SPINAL REGULARS.

SEPARATE CHARGES AGAINST ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING OTHER COMMITTEE- YEAH I. YEAH WE TRY TO DRESS MADE ISSUES ARE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION- I WOULD MAKE NOTE JUST TO SIT BACK THAT- I KNOW YOU'VEBEEN WORKING ON PRIVACY FOR VERY LONG TIME IT'S SEEN A LOT OF THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE CHAMPIONED HERE ON THE FLOOR. THINGS HAVE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT WAS THAT HEALTH INFORMATION WHERE HE HAD A BODY PRIVACY LAWS LIKE HIPAA AND SEE MY EIGHT ROUNDS HEALTH. INFORMATION HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MORE MORE HEALTH INFORMATION IS BEING GATHERED OUTSIDE SO THE HEALTHCARE SETTING RIGHT SO NORMALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE OKAY FINE WE'LL HAVE A HOLTER MONITOR DATA CARDIOLOGISTS ORDERS THAT'S GOING TO TRACK YOUR HEART RATE TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE TO RID ME OF IT NOW YOU HAVE AN APPLE WATCH THAT'S ACTUALLY MONITORING YOUR RHYTHM. RIGHT SO WITH THAT THAT THAT THE LANDSCAPE HAS SHIFTED AND SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION SAID WELL YEAH WE HAVETHESE PRIVACY IT CETERA FORTY ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY COLLECTING HEALTH INFORMATION SO I GET THE IDEA ABOUT. YOU KNOW WELL YOU HAVE A WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM YOU'RE PUTTING IN STUFF ABOUT YOUR MOOD IS THAT NOW A HEALTH DEVICE NO BUT YOU DO HAVE COMMERCIAL DEVICES ARE INTENTIONALLY- CAPTURING. HOW IF. VISIT INFORMATION OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND- I THINK. THE PUBLIC'S. UNDERSTANDING EXPECTATION AT LEAST OUR GENERAL. SENSE IS THAT WELL THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS HOW'S THAT GOING TO BE USED MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING HEALTH LAWS DON'T THINK IT COULD BE ABUSED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY- SOMEONE TO HOUSE IT DOES HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH. YOU CAN TAKE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA AND START. PULLING ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS OUT OF THAT ESPECIALLY BEING INTEGRATED WITH OTHER OTHER DATA SETS. I THINK THAT'S THE IT CERTAINLY FOR ME THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT. COMMERCIAL COLLECTION OF HEALTH INFORMATION IS NOT ABUSED IN A WAY THAT. ARE NOT USED IN WAYS THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T EXPECT IT TO BE USED RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF HOW MIGHT BE USED. INAPPROPRIATELY AND WE NEED TO PUT THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED ABOUT WHETHER THEY WANT TO OPT IN OR OPT OUT OR WHATEVER ELSE. THEY KNOW WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE SO- APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED AREA SO I DON'T KNOW WE GOT ENTIRELY RIGHT. BUT I THINK WE TRY TO MAKE THE RIGHT STRIDES WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THESE DEVICES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T EXACTLY HAVE TO STORE FOREVER SOME OTHER ISSUES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO FIND A PLACE WHERE. WE COULD WORK ON. THIS PRIVACY ISSUES THAT SPACE FOR DATE FIT. MORE APPROPRIATELY. TO BE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION WAS AN ABUSE AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- WITH THIS BILL WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE AREA. AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT'S A GREAT CLOSE- THAT'S WHEN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL SO. YOU KNOW WORKING WITH US AND- HOW YOU GOT I EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK TO YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS NOT TO CAPTURE EVERY SINGLE DEVICE OR APPLICATION UNDER THE SUN. I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE VERY UNIQUE SITUATIONS THAT WE WANT TO CAPTURE. SO YOU KNOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH INFORMATION YOU KNOW. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CAPTURE THINGS LIKE A LAPTOP OR- OR LET'S SAY- DID YOU KNOW WHAT A SCALE FOR EXAMPLE. IN WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE TOOK HIM IN A WE DID. AND- YOU KNOW STICK. CAN TO GROW I THINK WE NEED TO BE. VIGILANT I THINK WE NEED TO. TRY TO KEEP PACE AND ALSO.

OUT OF THE GATE I DO WANNA THANK YOU AND CAN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WILL NOTE THAT SINCE JANUARY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ACCEPTED OVER TWENTY AMENDMENTS. TO THIS BILL TO CLARIFY WHAT THIS ISSUE IS ALL ABOUT HI THIS IS A AGAIN AS A PILOT IN BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN YOLO COUNTY. THIS IS 100% VOLUNTARY AND IT'S NOT ABOUT CRIMINALIZING OVER YOU KNOW WHICH IS A BRAIN DISEASE OF ADDICTION. THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT NEVER GET PROPER TREATMENT- THIS PILOT PROP PROGRAMS ABOUT PROVIDING AN OPTION FOR THOSE SUFFERING FOM SUBSTANCE. ABUSE DISORDER- THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT- WEEK CERTAINLYCAN CAN TEST OUT HERE IN IN OUR OUR COMMUNITY IN YOLO COUNTY WHICH ENDO CENTER YOU AND I BOTH REPRESENTS- THIS PROVIDES AGAIN A VOLUNTARY OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO JAIL OR PRISON. TO SEEK TREATMENT IN LIEU OF INCARCERATION THESE ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO HOME LET'S SAY SERVED WITH AND GET AN ANKLE BRACE AND A PROBATION THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE GETTING. A JAIL SENTENCE- THIS WOULD BE EITHER BE ACCESSED BY. MEDICAL PROVIDERS- PROFESSIONALS NOT BY ADA OR A JUDGE TO FOCUS ON WHO IS RIGHT FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND IF THEY CHOOSE. AT ANY POINT THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS THAT IN GO BACK TO THE RICH SENTENCE AND GO BACK TO CENTRALLY. INCARCERATION ONCE TREATMENTS COMPLETED THE INDIVIDUAL THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPUNGE. THE FELONY RECORD OF ALL UNDERLYING ARRESTS RELATED. TO THESE- ADDICTION RELATED CRIMES. WE MUST COME TOGETHER WITH NEW SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING- THIS PILOT WILL ALLOW US TO TEND TO DO SO RIGHT HERE. IN OUR COMMUNITY I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TO THE QUESTIONS AND DIALOGUE HERE TODAY. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY. IS THE DA OF YOLO COUNTY JEFF REISIG. AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY.

TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ARE GOING TO PRISONS AND JAILS FOR CRIMES THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION. PRISONS AND JAILS ARE SIMPLY NOT PLACES WHERE SICK PEOPLE GO TO GET BETTER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS STOP THE REVOLVING DOOR. ABC FIFTEEN FORTY TWO PROPOSES A LOCAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON IN JAIL FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY LEVEL CRIMES MOTIVATED BY THEIR SERIOUS ADDICTION TO DRUGS. BUT WE SIMPLY POSE TOO MUCH OF A RISK FOR A JUDGE TO RELEASE THEM INTO AN UNSECURED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY COULD SIMPLY WALK AWAY OR CRAWL OUT A WINDOW ON DAY ONE. AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. INSTEAD AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO ENVISIONS CREATING A SECURE. HOSPITAL LIKE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT JAIL BARS AND GUARDS AND GUNS. THAT CAN SERVE AS A SANCTUARY FOR SERIOUSLY AND YOU CAN FELONY OFFENDERS WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO TRY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN A SAFE AND SECURE SETTING INSTEAD OF MERELY BEING WAREHOUSE BEHIND BARS IN PRISON. WE CALL THIS POTENTIAL PLACE HOPE YELLOW. I WOULD ALSO MAKES THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE YOU NEED. IS IT AT ALL IT WILL BE DESIGNED AND STAFFED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHO IS AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE. AND WHO IS NOT AND WHAT THE TREATMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. FOR THOSE WHO DO SUCCESSFULLY CHOOSE AND COMPLETE TREATMENT OVER PRISON THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED. AND GET A CLEAN STORE RIGHT HERE AT HOME IN YOUR LITTLE COUNTY. ULTIMATELY AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO IS A VERY MEASURED PILOT BILL. THAT IS DESIGNED TO OFFER A VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON OR JAIL. I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THIS PILOT A CHANCE THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH-MODERATOR FOR LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- NO I HAD A DISCUSSION WITHOUT THE AUTHOR'S WALLACE HAD THE CAR OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SEE HERE IS- I GUESS A LIST OF LATE OPPOSITION THEY CAME AND SO WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY DISCUSS THIS ISSUE FURTHER WITH THOSE THAT OPPOSE AND- YOU KNOW I HAVE TO TAKE NOTE. AND NOW THE OPPOSITION RATE THEY RANGE FROM THE SPACE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO SOCIAL WORKERS HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES TOO YOU KNOW PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND SO CLEARLY THERE'S I THINK OPPORTUNITY HERE TO SIT DOWN WITH THIS GROUP OF OPPOSITION AND BRADY TRY TO GET IT RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM PROGRAM THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO THE DISTRICT BY THAT- I THINK A ONE AT THE CALLER SAID A BASS YOU KNOW. I THINK IT DOES REQUIRE A SIT DOWN WITH A MUCH BROADER COALITION TO SEE IF WE CAN REALLY WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY AS I HAD ALREADY TOLD ME THE AUTHOR BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS STATE OPPOSITION REALLY GIVES ME PAUSE AND I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE OPTED TO CONTINUE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. ARE THINKING WITHOUT A MOVE THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. REMEMBERS YES AND AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WELL HE CERTAINLY HAVE A BUNCH OF OPPOSITION SELLING THEIR MCCARTY- I WILL SAY THAT- THAT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL IS ONE PILOT PROGRAM I THINK. CLOSING OFF OR MAYBE I'LL MAKE A BAD PUN SAY LOCKING THE DOOR ON- ONE FORM OF TREATMENT DOES NOT GIVE IT A TRY DOESN'T FEEL SHORT SIGHTED- SO- BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ABOUT THE FUNDING I KNOW IT'S A PILOT. AND I HER THIRD SOME AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WHERE WHERE'S THE FUNDING COMING FROM IS IT WELL THE COUNTY JUST PROVIDED FOR THE FUND THE OPIOID FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY USED FOR THAT IS THAT THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCE. SURE THAT THERE'S NO STATE FUNDING IN THIS THIS AGAIN AS A PILOT- WE CLARIFIED IN THAT FIRST HEALTH COMMITTEE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ON MEDICARE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT SUCH A 200% UP TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAVE EMBRACES THEY'VE ENDORSED IT'S ONE OF THEIR AGENDA ITEMS FOR THIS YEAR. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT COUNTY PARTS OF RESOURCES INCLUDING THEIR COUNTY GENERAL FUND INCLUDING POTENTIAL ONE TIME MONEY LIKE THEIR COUNTY ALLOCATION FOR THIS OPIOID SETTLEMENT THAT'S A PIECE BUT- THE TOURNEY I MEAN SORRY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TALKED ABOUT POTENTIALLY GETTING A PHILANTHROPY AND OTHERS TO LOOK AT IT BUT- ISN'T IT IT'S NOT AT ALL THROUGH THE STATE THAT WERE CERTAINLY WORK WORK WE ARE AUTHORIZING THIS TO HAPPEN IN STATE LAW THE SENTENCING. STRUCTURE TO WORK AND IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIND IT OKAY ANNA AND JUST ONE FINAL MORE OF A COMMON I GUESS I'M SURE THERE'S A FINE STUDENT THAT SEX DEDERT UC DAVIS- PERHAPS. WHO COULD DO SOME. TO DO SOME EVALUATE OF THIS THINK IT'S GOING BE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THERE'S NOT A LOT EVIDENCE. DEVICE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A LOCKED FACILITY- SO I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA GET A PILOT THAT SHOULD BE GOOD TO. TO START GATHERING THAT INITIAL DATA ABOUT BLINK THE STAY HOW LONG PEOPLE STAY WHAT WHAT THE- THE ACTUAL TREATMENT WILL BE AND THEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT AFTER. POSTING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WHO- OF MAYBE IN THE NEXT FEW CLEAR TODAY THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WE COULD PUT IN THERE SOME TYPE OF. A MANDATED EVALUATION PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU SEVERAL WINNER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SO I WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS SO I HAD MY CONCERNS ABOUT IT- FOR THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY THE OPPOSITION I HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS BEFORE THIS CAME TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR- I ALSO HAD. VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPONENTS TO NUMBER THREE MORE IN MY DISTRICT IN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE WITH AND WORK WITH VERY VERY CLOSELY ON VARIOUS. PROGRESSIVE DRUG POLICY. APPROACHES TOWARDS ENDING THE WAR ON DRUGS IN TREATING DRUGS AS A HEALTH ISSUE. NOT A CRIMINAL ISSUE- AND SO- I ULTIMATELY IN PUBLIC SAFETY. WE HAD A VERY VERY PRODUCTIVE HEARING- AND- HOW LONG COLLOQUY BETWEEN AMONG ME AND THE AUTHOR AND THE- AND THE SPONSOR. ON ABOUT. WAYS THAT THE BILL COULD BE REALLY TIGHT END. AND A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE WORKED ON BY THE TWO COMMITTEES COLLABORATIVELY CAME OUT OF THAT DISCUSSION CENTER COM LONGER WAS ALSO INVOLVED. IN NARCOTIC WE- TO MAKE SURE THE FIRST ONE NO ONE EVER WOULD SPEND MORE MORE TIME- IF THEY DO THIS DIVERSION- THAN THEY WOULD UNDER THEIR EXISTING SENTENCE- AND THAT INCLUDES THE CREDITS THAT THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO. IF THEY WENT THROUGH THE NORMAL INCARCERATION PROCESS- IN ADDITION WE ARE HAVING STRENGTH AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT A MEDICAL- PERSONAL PHYSICIAN WOULD ALTERNATELY MAKE THE DECISION IS NOT UP TO A JUDGE. TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND SO I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO. TIGHTEN UP THE BILL. ON THIS IS IT IS A HARD ISSUE- AND THE WAY WE'VE APPROACHED. BY DRUG USE AND ADDICTION OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN ABYSMAL FAILURE THAT WE'VE TAKEN THE APPROACH THAT IF WE JUST ARREST-PEOPLE. ACROSS THREE PEOPLE TO SOMEHOW STOP USING DRUGS WITHOUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE A HEALTHIER APPROACH. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS SPACE. FOR LIMITED PILOT PROGRAMS- NO FANCY- ACCOUNT IT'S NOT A SMALL COUNTY BUT IT'S NOT LA COUNTY OR ALAMEDA COUNTY IT'S A SMALLER COUNTY- WONDERFUL COUNTY A SMALL COUNTY. WHERE THEY TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF THIS. MAYBE IT'LL BE UNTIL FELL. AND THEN THE PILOT. EXPIRE BUT MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE. WHO ARE ALREADY. GOING TO BE HERE. ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE INCARCERATED HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME AND NON VIOLENT CRIME. AND THIS GIVES THEM AN OPTION AND I KNOW MY FRIENDS DISAGREE WITH ME ON THIS- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. AS THE BILL HAS EVOLVED I THINK IT IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MANY MEMBERS YES IT IS SENATOR RUBIO SORRY AND THE NECESSARILY ALL RIGHT I WANT TO GO. I THINK I KNOW WHICH MY CLOTHES AND I JUST WANNA- ASK ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. ASK BEFORE- I ATE. HERE WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE- OUTLINE BILL AND IT TALKS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUING OUT PATIENT TREATMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. IT ALSO SECTION EIGHT DISCUSSES- A RECOMMENDATION COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUTPATIENT COUNSELING. AND OTHER VITAL COMPONENTS CAN YOU PLEASE ADDRESS. THE FOLLOW UP A TRUE WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS FOLLOW THROUGH AND- AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW SUCCESS IN THE RECOVERY. KING A TRUST THAT PLEASE SURE. WELL FIRST OF IT'S INPATIENT FOR THE TERM OF THEIR OF THEIR SENTENCE AND I THINK YOU MEAN AFTER THAT AFTER THEY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THAT- HE- POTENTIALLY THE PERSON WOULD BE ON PROBATION AND THE TERMS OF THEIR- PROBATION OR PAROLE WOULD BE. THROUGH SOME TYPE OF OUTPATIENT- TREATMENT BUT- POTENTIALLY IF WE STILL HAVE A LINE OUR OUR OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY IF WE COULD HAVE HIM- APPOINTED ON THIS. THIS IS SO MODERATE PLEASE PRINT ON A DIFFERENT- YOU'RE ON GOOD EXCELLENT PLEASE I AM ON YES IS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS THE TREATMENT. STAFF AND WHAT WE ENVISION HERE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IN YOLO COUNTY WOULD BE- PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE TREATMENT OVERSEEN THE TREATMENT. AND THEY WOULD BE MONITORING THE INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS THROUGH BOTH THE END. YOUR PORTION. AND THEN STEPPING THEM DOWN. AS APPROPRIATE BASED ON THEIR NEEDS WHERE THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED IN A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY. AND THEY CAN THEN BE STEPPED DOWN AGAIN IN THE JUST STRAIGHT OUT PATIENTS. BUT ALL ALONG THEY WOULD BE MONITORED BY TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS- AND ULTIMATELY THE TREATMENT PROFESSIONALS WOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO THE COURT THAT THE PERSON HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THAT COULD BE ON A VERY EXPEDITED. TIMELINE DEPENDING ON THE PERSON. THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU TO SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES- I DO KIND OF EMPATHIZE WITH OUR WITH THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I BELIEVE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IS SAYING TO. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING IN CONCERT INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR DRUG ADDICTION IS NOT WORKING AND WE HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING. MAYBE DIFFERENT MAYBE NEW AND I THINK THIS COULD BE IT SO- I WANT TO SEE US MOVE FORWARD AND TRYING TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE DATE OF THE BILL TODAY BUT- IF YOU CAN PLEASE LOOK AT SOME OF THE- ISSUES THAT ARE THE OPPOSITION RAISE BECAUSE I DO THINK SOME OF THEM ARE LEGITIMATE. THANK YOU SIR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN- S. ASSUMING MCCARTY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS COMMITTEE NOW HAS SAID THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE ARE DOING SO FAR ISN'T WORKING AND IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE- WHAT WE ALL SEE YOU DRIVING INTO THE CAPITAL- THE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED HELP OUT THERE AND JUST AREN'T GETTING IT AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE CONVERSATION I HAD. WITH SOMEONE IN MY DISTRICT IN THIS HAPPENED LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO SO WASN'T EVEN RECENT BUT THIS BILL- REMINDING ME OF THAT CONVERSATION AND THIS GENTLEMAN YOU KNOW HE HE'S TYPICALLY ON THE CORNER IN MY CITY ALL THE TIME AND- HIS NAME IS GEORGE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH GEORGE ONE DAY AND YOU KNOW HE FREELY ADMITTED THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO DRUGS HE'D BEEN IN AND OUT OF. PRISON IN JAIL OVER THE YEARS HAD A LENGTHY RECORD AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HAVE YOU TRIED TREATMENT. TOM AND HE SAID HE DID AT ONE POINT. BUT HE JUST. YOU KNOW THE URGE WAS TOO STRONG AND SO HE LEFT- AND I. YOU KNOW ASK THEM BOWL WHAT WOULD HELP YOU I MEAN WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET YOU INTO SOME KIND OF TREATMENT AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN THIS WAS FIVE YEARS AGO OR SEVEN HE LAUGHED AND HE SAID. THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME OR ANYONE IS GONNA HELP ME IS IF YOU LOCK ME IN THERE. AND I JUST. YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF PUZZLED BY THAT BUT HE SAID I CAN'T I CAN'T STAY. I JUST I CAN'T DO IT I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN I NEED. HIM I NEED SOMEBODY TO KIND OF. PUT SOME HE DIDN'T USE THESE WORDS BUT PUT SOME STRUCTURE. IN THERE SO I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY A POPULATION IT WILL RESPOND WELL. TO THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM AND IT IS A SMALL. PILOT PROGRAMS SO I YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEN WE KNOW. IT DOESN'T WORK BUT IT'S WORTH A TRY. TO SEE IF IT DOES WORK- AND IF IN THE END WE CAN EXPAND IT ACROSS THE STATE I WOULD BE MORE TENTATIVE. IF YOUR BILL TODAY WAS TO. PUT THIS IN A PLACE YOU KNOW STATE WIDE BUT I THINK IT'S A MEASURED APPROACH AND I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT BECAUSE- WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S- WE'VE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE THIS ADDICTION OR CYCLING IN AND OUT OF. OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW CAN BE HELPED SO- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT THANK YOU CHAD. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE NUMBERS. K. C. NINE APOLOGIZE I THINK- CENTER LEYVA UNDERSTANDS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY THE ANGLES ON THIS. SO IT'S HARD TO SEE THE ARGUMENT- SO SEVERAL CARTY- IT DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. YOU KNOW WE BOTH REPRESENT THE SAME AREA YELLOW COUNTY- PREHEAT THE OPRY TALK TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY RIGHT SICK ABOUT- THIS IDEA. I HAVE TO HIT THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT I HAVE HAD. MANY CONCERNS- THAT WATERS I THINK THAT IS THE OPPOSITION HAS EXPRESSED- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT GENERALLY- WHEN IT COMES TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT- FORTUNATELY LOCKING THEM UP. ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK THE DATA IS NOT THERE TO SHOW THAT- HOWEVER IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION- THAT CHALLENGES THAT- THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE. GOING TO BE LOCKED UP NO MATTER WHAT- UNFORTUNATE COMMITTED A CRIME. NOW WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER YOU KNOW IT FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHO SHOULD BE LOCKED UP ENOUGH AT LEAST UNDER THE EXISTING LAW. THEY WILL THEY ARE READY GOING TO BE INCARCERATED NOW- I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT- AND I KNOW MY CONVERSATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT THIS YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM IS NOT GONNA BE FUNDED BY CUTTING. FUNDING TO. SERVICE USED TO THAT HAPPEN IN THE JAIL RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL. BUT WE WANT TO CREATE A DIFFERENT OPTION- THAT IS- LESS- THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS MORE FOCUSED ON TREATMENT LESS ON INCARCERATION- AND- THAT'S WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT IT'S- IT IS STILL IN CAR EIGHT YEARS SO IT'S A SECURE FACILITY SO PEOPLE ARE STILL. YOU KNOW BLACKED OUT- IT'S DATE BUT THEY HAVE ALSO COMMITTED A CRIME SAID RELATED TRYING THAT UNFORTUNATELY- THAT. NEEDS UPDATING WE CAN'T LET THEM GO FREE AND SOCIETY AT LEAST UNDER CURRENT LAW- BUT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF THEY TYPICALLY FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT ACTUALLY. PERHAPS GET OUT EARLY- AND ALSO GET THE RECORD EXPUNGED SO I THINK THOSE ARE POSITIVE THINGS. SO IT IS A PILOT- I CERTAINLY- IS HERE AT THE OPPOSITION THEIR CONCERNS WE CERTAINLY DON'T MAKE IT A HABIT THAT THAT THAT THE STANDARD WE HEAD OF SECURITY SO HE'S FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AS BEING THE STANDARD FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO WE'RE LOOKING AT A PILOT THAT MAYBE CAN CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO FOR. THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO UNFORTUNATELY- UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WOULD HAVE STILL HAVE TO BE INCARCERATED OR- INTO SECURE- SETTING- AND- AND SEE WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY HELPS PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET. TAKEN CARE OF EARLIER AND ALSO- I GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART THEIR LIVES. WITH THEIR SUBSTANCE USE- UNDER BETTER CONTROL.AND SO- REALLY FISH YOUR ON THIS- AGAIN IT'S A PILOT- DEVELOPMENT WAS ACTUALLY TO BE SURE TO ACTUALLY ASK THAT TO THE PARTIAL CARE SERVICES WHICH NORMALLY OVERSEAS THAT WE WANT THE SERVICE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS AND- THEY DO OVERSEE- SERVICES TREATMENT PROGRAMS ABILITY. ON SECURITY ONCE BUT AT LEAST TO BE SURE THAT THE TREATMENT. OVER THAT THE OVERSIGHT OVER THE TREATMENT IS- AND LONG WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE STATE- THAT- THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS FACILITY ARE TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND FAIRLY- I THOUGHT THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NORMALLY TO SAY. IT THAT THE STANDARD IS NOT A SECURE FACILITY. BUT APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS AND WITHOUT WHICH I CLOSE. YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE- THE DIALOGUE I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE ISSUES. TO CENTER ADMIN THERE ISN'T HERE AND I DID OVER LOOK AT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN HERE ABOUT AN OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT BY AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR BUT POTENTIALLY WE CAN CLARIFY THAT AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE COUNTY REPORT BACK TO. THE LEGISLATURE. NOT JUST AN EVALUATION AS FAR AS- WHAT THE VALUES OF THIS PROJECT ARE AND HOW IT COULD BE. POTENTIALLY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA I GET THE BIG PICTURE IS AS AS OTHERS SAID IT'S A BIG LIST OF OPPOSITION. AND THIS IS IT THIS JOB SOMETIMES PUTS US IN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITIONS. THEY HAVE TO SAY NO TO SOME PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH- CERTAINLY HAVE AUTHORED BILLS. ON THAT WORK WITH MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION. TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF I THOUGHT FOR ONE SECOND THAT THIS BILL WOULD INCARCERATE MORE INDIVIDUALS PUT MORE PEOPLE. BEHIND BARS- FOR DRUG RELATED CRIMES I WOULD NEVER AUTHORED THIS BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I WOULD. DITCH IT RIGHT HERE TODAY BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OTHERWISE AS YOU SAID CHAIRMAN PAN. GOING TO BE IN A STATE PRISON OR COUNTY JAIL FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. POTENTIALLY THEIR DRUG ADDICTION THERE COULD WORSEN WE KNOW THAT DRUGS ARE BROUGHT INTO PRISON AND JAIL UNFORTUNATELY. SO THEY COULD COME OUT YOU. REALLY SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE A CHOICE. TO GO TO GO TO. A DRUG TREATMENT OPTION. AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE THEIR SENTENCES HAVE EXPUNGEMENT. AND SOMETHING THAT REALLY COULD WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY CENTER. BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE DISASTERS IN OUR CITIES AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- DISTRICTS. JUST LAST WEEK LIKE YOU. I WAS ON AN HOUR LONG **** THIS CALL AND ASSUME COSTS WHAT I DO DURING THAT HOUR. I WALKED UP AND DOWN K. STREET. AND I SAW THINGS FIRST HAND THAT YOU KNOW THAT. I DON'T DON'T MAKE ME PLEASANT HERE IN MY DISTRICT TO MY COMMUNITY I TALKED TO ONE RESIDENTIAL SHOP. HERE AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE. PERSON LIKE I SAY WHAT SHOP WHAT PERSON. THEY SAID YEAH I KNOW THIS PERSON. I KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THEY HAVE A MAJOR DRUG ADDICTION THEY'VE BEEN COMING IN HERE AND- AND CAN COMMIT A CRIME AND BREAKING IN THIS TO. BREAK IN AND STEALING STUFF ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND- IF THEY EVER GET SENTENCED. YOU KNOW THEY WON'T HAVE. TO TYPE IN DRUG TREATMENT. IN THE FACILITY WHERE THEY'RE GOING SO YOU KNOW WE SEE IT. WE SEE IT ON A DAILY BASIS THE CURRENT SYSTEM. IS NOT WORKING- THE BEST CASE THIS IS A PILOT THAT WE CAN REPLICATE. TO THE OTHER. FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WORST CASE IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRIED HERE WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE- AGAIN. WE HAVE TO GO ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND WITH THAT I DO. APPRECIATE ALL THE DIALOGUE AND I AND WE ARE WORKING- IT WITH THE OPPOSITION EVERY KID EVERY COMMITTEE WE'VE TAKEN CHANGES AGAIN WE TAKEN OVER TWENTY. AMENDMENTS LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION OVER THE PAST. FOUR FIVE MONTHS. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH SO WITH THAT. I ASK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU.
