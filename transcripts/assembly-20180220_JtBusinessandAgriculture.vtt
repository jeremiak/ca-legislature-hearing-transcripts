THRESHOLD LEVEL MIGHT BE TOO

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:03.922 region:rollup2
HIGH IN OTHER WORDS. IF IF IF A

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:05.356 region:rollup2
FIVE NANOGRAM LEVEL FERENC.

00:37:03.922 --> 00:37:06.758 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE IS ESTABLISHED

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.325 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2
ARE IMPAIRED WELL BELOW THAT

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:10.028 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.895 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:12.831 region:rollup2
OF SCIENTIFIC.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:14.799 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT.

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:16.468 region:rollup2
IF YOU ESTABLISH FIVE NANOGRAMS

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:18.169 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:19.738 region:rollup2
UNTIL WELL ABOVE THAT THAT THAT

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:21.106 region:rollup2
AMOUNT AND AGAIN THAT IS ALL

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.940 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE. COMPLEXITY OF

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:24.342 region:rollup2
THIS OF THIS.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:26.444 region:rollup2
OF CANNABIS AND THE INABILITY

TO CORRELATED TO ALCOHOL CENTER

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.913 region:rollup2
BIG CHALLENGE ON THE DO YOU ID

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.415 region:rollup2
FRONT FOR US.

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:33.184 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BIG CHALLENGE IS.

00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:34.452 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.754 region:rollup2
MEASURE MARIJUANA SO I. I PULL

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:37.155 region:rollup2
SOMEONE OVER AND I SUSPECT HIM

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:38.590 region:rollup2
OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND

00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:39.991 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY HAVE THERE'S EVIDENCE

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.059 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE CONSUMED.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:42.794 region:rollup2
CANNABIS RECENTLY.

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:44.629 region:rollup2
.

00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:46.664 region:rollup2
THE IMPAIRING ASPECTS OF

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:47.232 region:rollup2
CANNABIS THAT DELTA NINETY EIGHT

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:49.167 region:rollup2
C. LEAVES YOUR SYSTEM VERY

00:37:47.232 --> 00:37:51.202 region:rollup2
QUICKLY SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:53.338 region:rollup2
TO TO MEASURE THAT IMPAIRING

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:54.706 region:rollup2
LEVEL CANNABIS.

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:56.141 region:rollup2
I CHALLENGE AT SOMEWHAT RELATED

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:58.610 region:rollup2
TO THAT IS THAT WE DON'T IN LAW

00:37:56.141 --> 00:38:00.278 region:rollup2
FOR SOME WE DON'T HAVE A DEVICE.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.246 region:rollup2
IN THE FIELD FOR OFFICERS TO BE

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.747 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MEASURE.

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:03.948 region:rollup2
CANNABIS LEVELS IN YOUR SYSTEM

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:05.450 region:rollup2

PRELIMINARY ALCOHOL SCREENING

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:10.889 region:rollup2
DEVICES THAT THAT WE CAN USE AS

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:13.158 region:rollup2
A FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS IN THE

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:15.493 region:rollup2
FIELD. THERE IS NO.

00:38:13.158 --> 00:38:16.661 region:rollup2
SIMILAR DEVICE TO MEASURE

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:19.464 region:rollup2
RECENT.

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:20.098 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS THAT

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.232 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR LAW

00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:22.734 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT.

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:24.135 region:rollup2
AND YOU COMBINE THESE WITH AN

00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:26.037 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT IS CERTAINLY GONNA

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:27.805 region:rollup2
BE MARKETING CANNABIS DIFFERENT

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:28.239 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENT WAYS SHAPES AND

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.841 region:rollup2
FORMS AND DIFFERENT

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.142 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATIONS ALL OF THESE

00:38:29.841 --> 00:38:33.545 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES BECOME I THINK.

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:34.245 region:rollup2
EVEN EVEN HARDER TO HANDLE.

00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:36.047 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:37.849 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR I'VE HAD

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:40.385 region:rollup2
SOME SPECIFIC PROVISIONS TO GET

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:41.653 region:rollup2

APPREHENDING IN PROSECUTING

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:53.331 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED DRIVERS.

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:54.432 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MONEY WILL START

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:55.867 region:rollup2
KICKING IN IN THE EIGHTEEN

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:57.335 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND WERE IN

00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:58.803 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW DEVELOPING

00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:01.039 region:rollup2
A PLAN ON WHERE TO SPEND THAT

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:02.607 region:rollup2
MONEY. IN EXISTING RESEARCH

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:04.042 region:rollup2
EFFORT THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW

00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:06.678 region:rollup2
IS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:07.212 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO IS ACTUALLY

DETERMINE.

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.015 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR AN

00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:12.083 region:rollup2
OFFICER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:13.051 region:rollup2
TO DETECT WHETHER SOMEONE IS

RECOGNITION EXPERT.

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:24.429 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON ALCOHOL WHEN YOU DO

00:39:22.994 --> 00:39:25.997 region:rollup2
A BETTER JOB IN DETECTING A DRUG

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:27.398 region:rollup2
PARA.

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:28.1000 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ASPECT OF OF.

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:30.869 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IS IT

00:39:28.1000 --> 00:39:31.436 region:rollup2
ALLOCATES A PORTION OF THE TAX

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.938 region:rollup2

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.084 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY SET ASIDE

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:48.152 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THAT MONEY WILL NOT

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.418 region:rollup2
JUST PAUSING CHEST.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:37.519 region:rollup2
SO. AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.288 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:41.490 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY INCARCERATED.

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:43.892 region:rollup2
BY POSSESSION DISABUSE OF

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:46.661 region:rollup2
CANNABIS.

01:27:43.892 --> 01:27:48.330 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CONCERNED YOU NOTE.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:50.398 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONVERSATION HASN'T

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:52.167 region:rollup2
MOVED FORWARD IN TERMS OF

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:53.635 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATION. SUMMER ó

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:55.303 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:57.105 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAVE A BILL THAT

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:59.674 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY LEVEL PLAYING

01:27:57.105 --> 01:28:01.176 region:rollup2
FIELD AS RELATES TO THOSE WHO'VE

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:02.611 region:rollup2
BEEN RECENT CARCERI WHOSE PAY

01:28:01.176 --> 01:28:05.147 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A DEBT TO SOCIETY

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:06.982 region:rollup2
TO COME OUT. AND ALSO BE

01:28:05.147 --> 01:28:09.651 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURS IN THIS SPACE.

01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:11.186 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:12.988 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR. ALL

01:28:11.186 --> 01:28:13.889 region:rollup2
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS OPPORTUNITY

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:15.590 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:17.159 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN LOW INCOME

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:20.395 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO.

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
TO BECOME CANOERS AND YOU KNOW

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
AND BE A PART OF THIS NEW A

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:27.035 region:rollup2
BALDING INDUSTRY.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.304 region:rollup2
AND CONCERNED THAT THIS IS JUST

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:29.771 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AGAIN FEDERAL

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.206 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ECONOMY AND

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:33.208 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:35.677 region:rollup2
TARGET AFTER AMERICA'S A LATINO

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:38.947 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES IN THIS SPACE.

01:28:35.677 --> 01:28:40.982 region:rollup2
AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:43.685 region:rollup2
SOMETHING GOING TO BE. A

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:45.587 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED IN WHICH CAN GIVE

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:46.955 region:rollup2
THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO CONVERT TO

01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:48.456 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD IN THIS SPACE

01:28:46.955 --> 01:28:50.392 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:52.627 region:rollup2
HAS IN FACT APPROVED SUCH TO BE

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:54.129 region:rollup2
THE CASE.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:55.664 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK WE CAN GIVE THEM

01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:57.299 region:rollup2
COMFORT IT IN THE SENSE THAT

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:59.167 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT SARAH IS

01:28:57.299 --> 01:29:01.203 region:rollup2
FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ENFORCING

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:03.138 region:rollup2
AND GIVING EFFECT TO STATE LAW.

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:04.773 region:rollup2
AND ANNA HAS HE SHOWN IN

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:06.474 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS OTHER POLICY AREAS WILL

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:07.342 region:rollup2
STAND TO DEFEND THE WILL OF THE

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:09.177 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.978 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.479 region:rollup2
WOULD INCLUDE IF THERE WAS

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:13.248 region:rollup2
TARGETED ENFORCEMENT THAT WOULD

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:14.349 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:15.884 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.851 region:rollup2
WOULD WITH AND WOULD BE TAKING A

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:18.320 region:rollup2
HARD LOOK AT.

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:19.888 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY AS I MENTIONED

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.623 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS

01:29:19.888 --> 01:29:22.624 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DICTATE WHAT THE

01:29:21.623 --> 01:29:24.259 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES OR

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:26.661 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DO IN THE SPACE. WHAT WE

01:29:24.259 --> 01:29:28.029 region:rollup2
CAN DO IS MONITOR THE SITUATION

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.898 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:32.133 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT FIND AREAS OF

01:29:29.898 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
COOPERATION THAT?

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:35.670 region:rollup2
ALL PARTIES AGREED ARE SHOULD BE

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:37.339 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES FOR ENFORCEMENT IN

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.440 region:rollup2
ORDER TO HOPEFULLY I STAND THAT

01:29:37.339 --> 01:29:40.342 region:rollup2
THE CONSPIRATORS CONCERNS YOU

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.378 region:rollup2
RAISE.

IN VERSES THE TRACK AND TRACE

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:09.004 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN SORT OF A TEMPORARY

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:10.472 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THAT I UNDERSTAND IT.

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:12.641 region:rollup2
AS WE TRANSITION TO THE FOUR

01:30:10.472 --> 01:30:13.808 region:rollup2
TRACK AND TRACE. CAN YOU TALK A

01:30:12.641 --> 01:30:15.176 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:16.544 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THE PAPER MANIFEST

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:18.146 region:rollup2
SYSTEM COMPARES THE TRACK AND

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:19.214 region:rollup2
TRACE SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:22.183 region:rollup2
PREVENTING IN GUARDING AGAINST

01:30:19.214 --> 01:30:24.619 region:rollup2
DIVERSION.

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:25.186 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.588 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT THE PAPER

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:28.290 region:rollup2
MANIFEST SYSTEM IS.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:30.525 region:rollup2
.

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:31.960 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:33.094 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THE SAME ELEMENTS THAT

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.896 region:rollup2
THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM WILL

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:36.631 region:rollup2
REQUIRE BUT ALLAH OBVIOUSLY

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:38.433 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IT BEING. IN AN

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:40.268 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC SYSTEM

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:40.835 region:rollup2
THAT MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAVE

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:43.638 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO IT DOES LIMIT US A

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:46.174 region:rollup2
BIT.

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:48.376 region:rollup2
DURING THIS PAPER NAM PROCESS

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:50.278 region:rollup2

THING THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED BACK

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:53.348 region:rollup2
AND.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:54.949 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER BUT ALSO

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:57.085 region:rollup2

THE BUREAU AND WORKING WITH LAW

01:30:57.085 --> 01:31:00.255 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:01.723 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION

01:31:00.255 --> 01:31:02.057 region:rollup2
IN THE EVENT THAT THE TO PULL A

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:03.258 region:rollup2
VEHICLE OVER.

01:31:02.057 --> 01:31:04.659 region:rollup2
.

01:31:03.258 --> 01:31:06.361 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO PREVENTING

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:07.829 region:rollup2
INVERSION DIVERSION AND AYE I'LL

JUST SAY EVEN WITH THE TRACK AND

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:11.499 region:rollup2
TRACE SYSTEM. THAT STILL IN

01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:13.001 region:rollup2
THERE A A SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:15.170 region:rollup2
DATA THAT ALLOWS YOU TO.

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:17.305 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR ANOMALIES AND AND.

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:18.740 region:rollup2
THINGS AT FLAG FOR ALERTS.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.675 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:22.744 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY ALSO IT'S CRITICAL

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:24.212 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A STRONG ENFORCEMENT

01:31:22.744 --> 01:31:26.414 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:28.316 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LICENSEES

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:29.818 region:rollup2
ARE COMPLYING SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:31.453 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COMPONENT THAT WILL

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.455 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENT THIS PAPER PROCESS IS

01:31:31.453 --> 01:31:36.091 region:rollup2

SORT OF ALONG THOSE LINES IS

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:43.631 region:rollup2
THERE ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.367 region:rollup2
WAS THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING. A

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:47.469 region:rollup2
BUDGET ALLOCATION TO HELP SPEED

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:09.744 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMPLYING.

01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:11.345 region:rollup2

MILLION POUNDS OF CANNABIS

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:26.894 region:rollup2

THIRTEEN AND HALF MILLION BUT.

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:39:28.396 --> 01:39:30.832 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT TWO AND HALF MILLION

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:33.434 region:rollup2
SUCH A BIG GAP THERE.

01:39:30.832 --> 01:39:34.836 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS A LOCAL AGENCY

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:37.572 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOP IN

01:39:34.836 --> 01:39:39.207 region:rollup2

GOVERNMENTS IS THAT YOUR POLICY

01:39:42.243 --> 01:39:46.280 region:rollup2
TO REFER BACK? AND IF SO HOW

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:47.949 region:rollup2
WERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING TO

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.951 region:rollup2

01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:54.755 region:rollup2
SOME THESE MULTI STATE MULTI.

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.124 region:rollup2
CARTELS THAT ARE RUNNING SOME

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:59.894 region:rollup2
THESE OPERATIONS.

01:39:57.124 --> 01:40:00.928 region:rollup2
AND SO I THE IT THAT WAS A YOU

01:39:59.894 --> 01:40:02.129 region:rollup2
SAID THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE IT

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:03.631 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE LIFE IS LOWER LATENCY

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:04.899 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOP OKAY.

01:40:03.631 --> 01:40:07.468 region:rollup2
.

01:40:04.899 --> 01:40:08.903 region:rollup2
I'M NOT I'M I'M BOYS AND I'M NOT

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:11.572 region:rollup2

IF WE ARE MADE AWARE OF.

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:14.575 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING ILLEGAL GROWS

01:40:13.908 --> 01:40:16.344 region:rollup2
ISN'T.

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:17.445 region:rollup2
IT SAID BASICALLY THAT IN WHERE

01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:19.046 region:rollup2
WAS SAID THAT LEE ILLEGAL

01:40:17.445 --> 01:40:20.748 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS WOULD BE PREFERRED

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:21.916 region:rollup2
BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OUR

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:23.684 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPOSED TO

01:40:21.916 --> 01:40:24.352 region:rollup2
HANDLE THAT. HANNAH AND THAT MAY

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:26.020 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:27.822 region:rollup2
IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN AS THE

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.191 region:rollup2
FEDERAL SEE THEM WILL KNOW OURS

01:40:27.822 --> 01:40:32.059 region:rollup2
SO IF IF WE ARE FOR INSTANCE ON

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:33.528 region:rollup2
THIS THIS TIP LINE THAT WE HAVE

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:34.996 region:rollup2
IF WE RECEIVE INFORMATION WE'RE

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:36.797 region:rollup2
GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON IT. WE'LL

01:40:34.996 --> 01:40:38.332 region:rollup2
SEE IF THEY'RE LICENSED WITH US

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:41.135 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE NOT.

01:40:38.332 --> 01:40:41.769 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE EDUCATING COME

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.271 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT.

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:44.805 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A MATTER WHERE WE DO

01:40:43.271 --> 01:40:45.706 region:rollup2
NEED TO REFER TO LOCAL LAW

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:48.376 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OUR LOCAL.

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:49.977 region:rollup2
LOCAL AGENCIES WILL BE WORKING

01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:51.979 region:rollup2
IN COOPERATION WITH THEM WE AT

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:53.547 region:rollup2
CFA OUR INSPECTORS ARE NOT

CERTIFIED PEACE OFFICERS WERE

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:57.451 region:rollup2
NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO WE DON'T

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:58.920 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT SAME POWERS AS LOCAL

01:40:57.451 --> 01:41:00.321 region:rollup2

MORNING SIXTY EIGHT. THOUSAND

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:01.048 region:rollup2
CULTIVATORS

01:41:59.513 --> 01:42:03.150 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT TWO PERCENT.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:04.585 region:rollup2
.

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:06.220 region:rollup2
WE GOT A WAYS TO GO OBVIOUSLY

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:06.754 region:rollup2
CORRECT IN IT YOU KNOW AND I

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.256 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SOME OF IT.

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:10.825 region:rollup2
THAT THE KEY THING IS THAT

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:12.493 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE CAN ISSUE THE STATE

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:14.228 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY LICENSE THE APPLICANT

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:15.763 region:rollup2
DOES NEED TO HAVE LOCAL APPROVAL

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.297 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES THAT IS WHERE

01:42:15.763 --> 01:42:18.132 region:rollup2
THE.

01:42:16.297 --> 01:42:18.866 region:rollup2
THEY ARE IN SOME CASES THE

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:20.101 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS WAITING ON LOCAL

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:22.036 region:rollup2
APPROVAL SO WE DO HAVE A LONG

01:42:20.101 --> 01:42:23.637 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO.

01:42:22.036 --> 01:42:25.439 region:rollup2
AND I'M KIND OF JUMPING AROUND

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:26.907 region:rollup2
HERE SO SOME LOCAL THERE ARE

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:28.376 region:rollup2
SOME LOCAL TRACK ENTRY SYSTEMS

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:30.077 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE HUMBOLDT COUNTY ONE

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:31.445 region:rollup2
HAS ONE WILL THAT BE ABLE TO

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:33.180 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE WITH THE STATE OR

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:35.049 region:rollup2
HOUSE SECOND WORK. YES SO AND

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:36.283 region:rollup2
WERE WERE ACT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:37.485 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING WITH THE

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:38.719 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:41.122 region:rollup2
IT.

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:42.890 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

01:42:41.122 --> 01:42:44.892 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE A LOCAL.

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:46.861 region:rollup2
THE THE LOCAL TRACK AND TRACE

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:48.796 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WON'T.

01:42:46.861 --> 01:42:50.331 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY USING

01:42:48.796 --> 01:42:52.967 region:rollup2
THEIR THEY'RE NOT USING THE

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:54.168 region:rollup2
STATE. RFID TAGS AND THAT'S

01:42:52.967 --> 01:42:54.969 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE KEY

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:57.872 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS FOR THE STATE'S

01:42:54.969 --> 01:42:59.140 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. SO WE WE ARE GOING TO

01:42:57.872 --> 01:43:01.642 region:rollup2
ALLOW WHAT WE WOULD CALL THEM.

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.842 region:rollup2
.

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.778 region:rollup2
LOCAL.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:05.780 region:rollup2
.

01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:07.815 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY VENDOR INTEGRATION

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:10.184 region:rollup2
WITH OUR SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO.

01:43:07.815 --> 01:43:11.952 region:rollup2
LIKE INTERFACE BUT WE'RE STILL

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.554 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS

01:43:11.952 --> 01:43:14.889 region:rollup2
THAT A LOCAL TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:16.857 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO.

01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:19.026 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE STATE TRACK ENTRY

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:20.294 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT THE GOAL IS.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.162 region:rollup2
WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT THE

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:22.496 region:rollup2
LICENSEE TO HAVE TO DUPLICATE

01:43:21.162 --> 01:43:24.131 region:rollup2
EFFORTS

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:25.833 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:27.968 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:43:25.833 --> 01:43:29.303 region:rollup2
ON. ANY AREAS WHERE WE CAN

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:30.638 region:rollup2
PREVENT AN OVERLAP ADJUDICATED

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:32.306 region:rollup2
DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS BUT WE'RE

01:43:30.638 --> 01:43:33.741 region:rollup2
JUST NOT SURE WHAT THAT'S WHAT

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:37.044 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE GET.

01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:37.912 region:rollup2
.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:40.147 region:rollup2
WHERE THE CONCERNS?

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:40.481 region:rollup2
SURELY. I KNOW IF I KNOW YOU'VE

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.383 region:rollup2
HEARD THIS.

01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:44.385 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S NOW THERE'S

01:43:42.383 --> 01:43:44.952 region:rollup2
COME ABOUT THERE'S A LACK OF A

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:47.254 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE CULTIVATION CAP.

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:48.989 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:50.691 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE THE FAA ISSUED

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:52.726 region:rollup2
AND HE AYE ARE.

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:54.628 region:rollup2
THAT INDICATED THERE WOULD BE A

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:57.298 region:rollup2
ONE ACRE CAP.

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:59.033 region:rollup2
YET VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT.

01:43:57.298 --> 01:44:02.336 region:rollup2
WHEN THE REX CAME OUT.

01:43:59.033 --> 01:44:05.272 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT.

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:07.241 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS.

01:44:05.272 --> 01:44:09.143 region:rollup2
OBTAIN AS MANY TYPE TO LICENSES

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:11.579 region:rollup2
AS THEY WANTED TO.

01:44:09.143 --> 01:44:14.648 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY.

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:16.250 region:rollup2
BUT. IN THE SPIRIT OF PROP SIXTY

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:18.686 region:rollup2
FOUR WHICH PROMISED. AN

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:20.621 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL GROWERS

01:44:18.686 --> 01:44:22.156 region:rollup2
TO GET. A FOOTHOLD GET INTO THIS

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:23.924 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:44:22.156 --> 01:44:26.127 region:rollup2
THAT BLEW A HUGE HOLE IN THAT

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:28.162 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

01:44:26.127 --> 01:44:30.030 region:rollup2
SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE LOGIC

01:44:28.162 --> 01:44:32.066 region:rollup2
BEHIND THAT BECAUSE THE PROMISE

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:33.667 region:rollup2
TO THE VOTERS.

01:44:32.066 --> 01:44:34.769 region:rollup2
AND THE PROMISED TO THE GROWERS

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:36.237 region:rollup2
AND AND THE FOLKS AT WORK ON MC

01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:37.638 region:rollup2
ARE AT SAY.

01:44:36.237 --> 01:44:38.839 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.340 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL GROWERS

01:44:38.839 --> 01:44:41.275 region:rollup2
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.909 region:rollup2
GROWERS.

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:43.711 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET

01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:45.446 region:rollup2
OR LESS.

01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:48.115 region:rollup2
SO THIS ALLOWS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:50.050 region:rollup2
FOR LARGELY CAPITALIZE PEOPLE TO

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:52.453 region:rollup2
COME IN. AND AND TAKE THIS

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.387 region:rollup2
MARKET. AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.591 region:rollup2
A HUGE PROLIFERATION OF THIS

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:12.059 region:rollup2

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:12.653 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE

01:48:11.285 --> 01:48:13.387 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY

01:49:39.339 --> 01:49:42.443 region:rollup2
THERE WAS RETIREMENT AND SO

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.844 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ACTING U. S. ATTORNEY

01:49:42.443 --> 01:49:45.512 region:rollup2
IN THE NORTHERN JUST.

01:49:43.844 --> 01:49:48.182 region:rollup2
AND NO NOMINEE AT ALL

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:49.917 region:rollup2
SO CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOUR

01:49:48.182 --> 01:49:51.285 region:rollup2
MIGHT. NOT REALLY GIVE CLEAR

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:54.321 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT

01:49:51.285 --> 01:49:55.823 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE CONFIRMED RIGHT.

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:56.857 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:49:55.823 --> 01:49:58.559 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN

01:49:56.857 --> 01:50:00.260 region:rollup2
A A MONTH AND A HALF ROUGHLY

01:49:58.559 --> 01:50:01.028 region:rollup2
SINCE THE COLEMAN WAS RESCINDED

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.995 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:50:01.028 --> 01:50:03.163 region:rollup2
REASONS DIRT THEY'RE STILL

01:50:01.995 --> 01:50:04.498 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET. VERY MUCH TRYING

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:06.700 region:rollup2
TO GET THEIR OWN DUCKS IN A ROW

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:08.035 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.536 region:rollup2
THAT THE DIRECTIONS FROM ABOVE

01:50:08.035 --> 01:50:10.971 region:rollup2
AND SO I I THINK THAT IT THAT IS

01:50:09.536 --> 01:50:12.439 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE BUT. YOU KNOW THIS WILL

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:13.607 region:rollup2
BE A ONE AND DONE MEETING WE HAD

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:14.908 region:rollup2
WE ANTICIPATE AN ONGOING

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:16.143 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE WITH THE FEDERAL

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:17.177 region:rollup2

01:50:21.315 --> 01:50:23.650 region:rollup2
ONLY IMAGINE THE DIFFICULTY.

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:24.985 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ON CONSIDERING THE

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:27.354 region:rollup2
TIMELINE TO PUT ALL THIS

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:28.889 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO I WHILE WHILE WERE

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:30.457 region:rollup2
POINTED IN OUR QUESTIONS HERE I

01:50:28.889 --> 01:50:31.792 region:rollup2
DON'T BITE WE CAN'T STATE ENOUGH

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:33.494 region:rollup2

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:34.495 region:rollup2
BEEN FOR YOU AND. AND APPRECIATE

THAT WE'VE HAD COLLECTIVELY I

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.309 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MEMBERS

01:50:47.975 --> 01:50:51.044 region:rollup2
OF THE PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY THE

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:52.412 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF THE

01:50:51.044 --> 01:50:53.247 region:rollup2
VOTER INITIATIVE. AND THAT OF

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.982 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE

01:50:53.247 --> 01:50:56.884 region:rollup2
STATE LEGISLATURE AND THEY JUST

01:50:54.982 --> 01:50:58.619 region:rollup2
SEE A SIMPLY AS GOVERNMENT AND

01:50:56.884 --> 01:51:00.988 region:rollup2
SO WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:50:58.619 --> 01:51:02.523 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS. IS SIGNIFICANT AND

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:03.557 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM A

01:51:02.523 --> 01:51:05.125 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS A

01:51:03.557 --> 01:51:05.959 region:rollup2
DEEP PASSION THAT TO GET THIS

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:07.828 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:09.396 region:rollup2

ENTITIES. AT HAND AND SO WE ARE

01:51:14.368 --> 01:51:17.237 region:rollup2

WE HAVE FOUR ADVERTISEMENTS

01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:49.836 region:rollup2

OF JUST FEBRUARY EIGHTH.

01:51:55.542 --> 01:52:00.213 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS THE COMPLETE.

01:51:58.178 --> 01:52:02.182 region:rollup2
DISREGARD AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:02.683 region:rollup2
OF THE RESPECT OF THE LAW AND

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:04.585 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:52:02.683 --> 01:52:06.486 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF. OF THE

01:52:04.585 --> 01:52:07.254 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE GOOD

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:10.057 region:rollup2
ACTORS.

01:52:07.254 --> 01:52:12.459 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT IT ENDEAVOR AND

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:15.762 region:rollup2
SUBJECT THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:16.463 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT AND SO WHAT WHO OF

01:52:15.762 --> 01:52:20.267 region:rollup2
THE THREE.

01:52:16.463 --> 01:52:22.202 region:rollup2
IS FOCUSED ON. THE ENFORCEMENT

01:52:20.267 --> 01:52:23.804 region:rollup2
AND ALSO SAY WE WE ALSO TOOK A

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:24.905 region:rollup2
LOOK AND VISIT JUST PLAYING

01:52:23.804 --> 01:52:26.740 region:rollup2
AROUND WITH SOME OF THE

01:52:24.905 --> 01:52:27.274 region:rollup2
ADVERTISING THAT WE SAW AND

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.141 region:rollup2
ENTERED IN THE APPROPRIATE

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:29.209 region:rollup2
LICENSE.

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:31.211 region:rollup2
AT WHICH WE FOUND THAT SOME OF

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:33.614 region:rollup2
THEM WERE FICTITIOUS.

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:35.182 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT AND

01:52:33.614 --> 01:52:37.684 region:rollup2
YOUR WORDS YOU MENTIONED STRONG

01:52:35.182 --> 01:52:39.586 region:rollup2

THIS IS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:43.757 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT US AS A

01:52:40.721 --> 01:52:44.925 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BODY.

01:52:43.757 --> 01:52:46.193 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD BE THE BUREAU'S

01:52:44.925 --> 01:52:48.462 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES TO.

01:52:46.193 --> 01:52:49.963 region:rollup2
REGULATE THE ADVERTISING AND

01:52:48.462 --> 01:52:52.466 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ITS ITS VAST

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:54.368 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST UP PRINT IT'S IT

01:52:52.466 --> 01:52:57.871 region:rollup2
SAW BILLBOARDS AND INTERNET

01:52:54.368 --> 01:52:58.972 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS. US SO AGAIN ONE OF

01:52:57.871 --> 01:53:00.874 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT IS COMING OUT OF

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:01.975 region:rollup2
THE CANNABIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:03.543 region:rollup2
IS THERE IS AN ENFORCEMENT

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:06.213 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT JUST FOR ADVERTISING

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:14.621 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S TAKING

01:53:12.319 --> 01:53:16.490 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES AND AND

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:18.258 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALREADY DEDICATING A LOT

01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:19.593 region:rollup2
OF OUR ENFORCEMENT STAFF JUST ON

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:21.328 region:rollup2
THIS ADVERTISING BECAUSE IT IS

01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:23.797 region:rollup2
THAT IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:53:21.328 --> 01:53:25.999 region:rollup2

AS. WE KNOW IT DID NOT JUST IN

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:29.970 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:32.172 region:rollup2
IT IS JEOPARDIZING.

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:33.674 region:rollup2
THE REGULATED MARKET AND AND I

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:35.242 region:rollup2
JUST WANT YOU KNOW WE WE'RE DEBT

WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT BY THE

01:53:35.242 --> 01:53:39.346 region:rollup2
WAY AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:41.815 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE ALREADY

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:42.482 region:rollup2
PUTS THE RESOURCES WE HAVE.

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:45.585 region:rollup2

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR.

01:53:46.086 --> 01:53:50.223 region:rollup2
.

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:53.393 region:rollup2
AND SO THE DIVERT TIMING THOUGH.

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:54.294 region:rollup2
ON ON THE ISSUE AT HAND AND IT

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:55.862 region:rollup2
MENTIONED I KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:56.730 region:rollup2
GONNA WIN BUT THIS WAS VERY TH

01:53:55.862 --> 01:53:58.298 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:59.599 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE

01:53:58.298 --> 01:54:01.334 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND. THE RESPECTIVE

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:02.969 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTION

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:04.504 region:rollup2
IS TAKEN I THINK IHEARD YOU

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:05.672 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY THAT WERE QUESTIONS

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.840 region:rollup2
ASKED YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:08.442 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WITH ENFORCEMENT YOU

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.209 region:rollup2
SAID YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

01:54:08.442 --> 01:54:10.644 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS YES.

01:54:09.209 --> 01:54:12.045 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:54:10.644 --> 01:54:14.081 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BAD ACTORS RIGHT NOW

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:15.382 region:rollup2
THEN IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IN

01:54:14.081 --> 01:54:16.783 region:rollup2
TIGHTENING FACT THAT WOULD BE.

01:54:15.382 --> 01:54:19.086 region:rollup2
CONTRARY TO.

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:20.721 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU HAD MENTIONED?

01:54:19.086 --> 01:54:22.089 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK THAT THE

01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:23.657 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RESOURCES HAS BEEN

01:54:22.089 --> 01:54:26.126 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO THE BUREAU WE'RE

01:54:23.657 --> 01:54:28.095 region:rollup2
ALSO STILL GETTING STAFFED UP SO

01:54:26.126 --> 01:54:30.330 region:rollup2
AT RIGHT NOW DO I HAVE ENOUGH

01:54:28.095 --> 01:54:32.232 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO COME BACK ALL THIS

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:34.368 region:rollup2
ADVERTISING PROBABLY. I WILL

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:35.802 region:rollup2
HAVE AND I AM BUT SO WHAT WE DO

01:54:34.368 --> 01:54:37.504 region:rollup2
IS WHEN EVEN THOUGH OUR

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:38.472 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT STAFF MIGHT NOT BE

01:54:37.504 --> 01:54:41.341 region:rollup2
FULLY.

01:54:38.472 --> 01:54:43.276 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T HIRED EVERYBODY

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:45.212 region:rollup2
FULLY WEEK WE HAD I HAVE DIVERT

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.779 region:rollup2
OTHER RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE

01:54:45.212 --> 01:54:46.513 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT

01:54:45.779 --> 01:54:48.815 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S.

01:54:46.513 --> 01:54:50.250 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FROM OTHER AREAS OF

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:52.219 region:rollup2
THE BUREAU'S BECAUSE WE'VE

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:53.120 region:rollup2
REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I

01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:55.021 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THOUGH

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.457 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE CONTINUE TO ISSUE

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:58.859 region:rollup2
LICENSES I MEAN WE STILL HAVE A

01:54:57.457 --> 01:55:00.560 region:rollup2
LOT OF PENDING APPLICATIONS

01:54:58.859 --> 01:55:01.161 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT ISSUE THESE LICENSES

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.596 region:rollup2
WE GOT TO CONTINUE DOING THAT

01:55:01.161 --> 01:55:04.364 region:rollup2
SO.

01:55:02.596 --> 01:55:05.999 region:rollup2
IT IS A BALANCE SEEN OF MAKING

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:08.168 region:rollup2
SURE WE'RE CONTENT WE DON'T STOP

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:10.036 region:rollup2
ISSUING LICENSES AND OUT WE'RE

01:55:08.168 --> 01:55:10.737 region:rollup2
EDUCATING PEOPLE ON HOW TO GET

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:13.106 region:rollup2
LICENSED.

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:13.340 region:rollup2
AND THAT WERE NOTIFYING PEOPLE I

SACRAMENTO NEWS REVIEW

01:56:06.393 --> 01:56:09.729 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ACTION IS IT TO BE

01:56:08.228 --> 01:56:12.165 region:rollup2

01:56:21.508 --> 01:56:25.579 region:rollup2
LICENSE WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC

01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:27.080 region:rollup2

LICENSED AND THEY HAVE BEEN

01:56:30.884 --> 01:56:33.887 region:rollup2
ISSUED THEIR LICENSE AND THAT

01:56:32.319 --> 01:56:35.622 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE A VIOLATION

01:56:33.887 --> 01:56:36.957 region:rollup2

INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO GET OFF THE

02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:52.045 region:rollup2

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND

02:00:58.752 --> 02:01:01.888 region:rollup2

02:01:03.389 --> 02:01:06.659 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:08.695 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING.

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:10.430 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OTHER EXAMPLES IN

ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ASSOCIATE

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:18.037 region:rollup2
WITH INDUSTRY SO THEY'RE WORKING

02:01:16.536 --> 02:01:20.707 region:rollup2
ON ORGANICS PROGRAM WITH THE

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:22.876 region:rollup2
STATE TO REALLY IDENTIFY

02:01:20.707 --> 02:01:24.677 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AS THAT LEADER. AND

02:01:22.876 --> 02:01:27.480 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO TO GET TO THE POINT OF

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:29.582 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZING THE SMALLER.

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:31.885 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND GROWERS AND

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:34.554 region:rollup2

THE INDUSTRY'S HAD A LONG.

02:01:34.554 --> 02:01:38.858 region:rollup2
STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:41.427 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THEY ARE RESTRICTING

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:44.497 region:rollup2
LICENSES AND IN THE COUNTY SO

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:48.001 region:rollup2

SECTORS SO THAT'S A WAY THEY

02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:58.711 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:01:56.109 --> 02:02:01.214 region:rollup2
GETTING AT THAT OUTSIDE

02:01:58.711 --> 02:02:03.683 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT ON A IN THEIR

02:02:01.214 --> 02:02:06.553 region:rollup2

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:09.656 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN MONTEREY COUNTY.

THEY.

02:02:09.656 --> 02:02:16.062 region:rollup2
HAVE EXPERIENCE REGULATING THEM

02:02:12.759 --> 02:02:20.767 region:rollup2
THE MEDICINAL MARKET AND THIS

02:02:16.062 --> 02:02:22.535 region:rollup2
REALLY CAME FROM.

02:02:20.767 --> 02:02:25.071 region:rollup2
.

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:26.773 region:rollup2
MICRO ECONOMIC SITUATION IN

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:27.907 region:rollup2
THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY.

02:02:26.773 --> 02:02:30.043 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THIS IS JUST ON THE

02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:31.878 region:rollup2
REGULATORY SIDE SO THERE ARE

02:02:30.043 --> 02:02:33.079 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY FORTY ONE COUNTIES OUT

02:02:31.878 --> 02:02:35.081 region:rollup2
THERE THAT CURRENTLY HAVE SOME

02:02:33.079 --> 02:02:36.683 region:rollup2
TYPE OF BAND OR MORATORIUM IN

02:02:35.081 --> 02:02:37.650 region:rollup2
PLACE BUT I WOULD KNOW THAT I

02:02:36.683 --> 02:02:39.485 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT TEN OF THESE

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:41.287 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE ACTIVELY WORKING IN

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:43.690 region:rollup2
EARNEST TO. DEVELOP.

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:45.525 region:rollup2
THEIR ORDINANCE AND OR PUT.

02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:46.826 region:rollup2
TAX MEASURE ON THE BALLOT.

02:02:45.525 --> 02:02:48.094 region:rollup2

ANGELES COUNTY.

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:51.231 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES LIKE MANY OTHERS

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:53.166 region:rollup2
HAVE SPENT.

02:02:51.231 --> 02:02:54.300 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME DOING

02:02:53.166 --> 02:02:56.135 region:rollup2
PUBLIC OUTREACH.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:58.238 region:rollup2
AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON THE

02:02:56.135 --> 02:02:59.439 region:rollup2
ISSUE THEY'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE

02:02:58.238 --> 02:03:01.741 region:rollup2
OF ON PERMANENT AND I'M LICENSE

02:02:59.439 --> 02:03:04.878 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES. AS WELL BUT ON THE

02:03:01.741 --> 02:03:07.413 region:rollup2
RETAIL SIDE I THINK THERE US USE

02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:07.947 region:rollup2
OF CIOS OFFICE ARE REPORTED AT

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:10.083 region:rollup2
ONE POINT THAT THERE WERE

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:11.918 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. HUNDRED ON LICENSE

02:03:10.083 --> 02:03:13.353 region:rollup2
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS COUNTY

02:03:11.918 --> 02:03:15.188 region:rollup2
WIDE HUNDRED OF THOSE WERE IN

02:03:13.353 --> 02:03:16.422 region:rollup2
THE UNINCORPORATED AREA SO THEY

02:03:15.188 --> 02:03:17.757 region:rollup2
WANTED TO TAKE THEIR TIME TO

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:19.659 region:rollup2
REALLY HEAR FROM RESIDENTS WHAT

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:21.527 region:rollup2
TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY.

02:03:19.659 --> 02:03:22.929 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE WITHIN

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:25.298 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTION I THINK THEY

02:03:22.929 --> 02:03:28.101 region:rollup2
HOLD ABOUT THIRTY PUBLIC.

02:03:25.298 --> 02:03:30.436 region:rollup2
FORUMS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND

02:03:28.101 --> 02:03:33.039 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY ARE

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:36.442 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WITH A PHASED IN

02:03:33.039 --> 02:03:38.344 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT LIMITS LICENSES

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:41.547 region:rollup2
PER SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:43.983 region:rollup2
BASED ON POPULATION. SO AGAIN

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:46.419 region:rollup2
IT'S A WAY OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:48.554 region:rollup2
IS REALLY DESIGNING A PROGRAM

02:03:46.419 --> 02:03:52.792 region:rollup2

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:53.559 region:rollup2
WELL I OF THEIR COMMUNITY.

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.427 region:rollup2

TURN OVER MY COLLEAGUES I I DID

02:03:54.427 --> 02:03:55.762 region:rollup2
WANT TO MENTION.

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:56.729 region:rollup2
THAT TALKS ABOUT MEASURES THERE

02:03:55.762 --> 02:03:57.397 region:rollup2

NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE BEING FULLY

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:00.300 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED YEAH A COUPLE OF

02:04:00.066 --> 02:04:00.867 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:02.201 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE STILL IN THE

THERE WERE NONE SAYS BUT THEY

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:06.639 region:rollup2
WERE.

02:04:04.704 --> 02:04:07.407 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT FORWARD THINKING

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:09.709 region:rollup2
AND PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE

02:04:07.407 --> 02:04:11.244 region:rollup2

AND EFFECTIVE REGULATIONS. FOR

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:26.819 region:rollup2
MANY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE

02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:28.254 region:rollup2
GRASPING THE FULL RANGE OF THE

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:30.256 region:rollup2
CHANGES THE LAW IN THIS AREA.

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:31.791 region:rollup2

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:33.393 region:rollup2
TAX RATES.

02:05:31.791 --> 02:05:34.927 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT ROADS WE HIGH STATE

02:05:33.393 --> 02:05:37.196 region:rollup2
TAX RATE MAKES THE LETTER TASK

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:38.531 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC AT BEST.

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:40.066 region:rollup2
FOR OVER A YEAR NOW THE LEAGUE

02:05:38.531 --> 02:05:41.167 region:rollup2
IS MAINTAINED ON BEHALF OF ITS

02:05:40.066 --> 02:05:42.535 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THAT THE CUMULATIVE

TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:47.039 region:rollup2
TOO HIGH AND MUST BE LOWERED

02:05:45.805 --> 02:05:48.474 region:rollup2
THIS IS BASED ON THE FIFTEEN

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:49.809 region:rollup2
PERCENT STATE EXCISE TAX

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:51.711 region:rollup2
COMBINED WITH THE CULTIVATION

02:05:49.809 --> 02:05:53.546 region:rollup2

02:05:51.711 --> 02:05:55.081 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT.

02:05:53.546 --> 02:05:56.849 region:rollup2
THIS TAX MUST BE LOWERED FOR

02:05:55.081 --> 02:05:58.818 region:rollup2
THREE KEY REASONS.

02:05:56.849 --> 02:06:00.553 region:rollup2
FIRST THE CUMULATIVE TAX RATE

02:05:58.818 --> 02:06:02.088 region:rollup2
ONCE LOCAL TAXES ARE FACTORED IN

02:06:00.553 --> 02:06:03.222 region:rollup2
AND ADDED TO THE TOTAL VARIES

02:06:02.088 --> 02:06:05.158 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:07.193 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND FIFTY

02:06:05.158 --> 02:06:09.629 region:rollup2
PERCENT RATE THAT IS CERTAIN TO

02:06:07.193 --> 02:06:10.663 region:rollup2
STIMULATE BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY.

02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:12.465 region:rollup2
THE LEAGUE IS ISSUED WARNINGS

02:06:10.663 --> 02:06:14.100 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS SINCE JANUARY TWENTY

02:06:12.465 --> 02:06:16.035 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. THESE FIGURES ARE

ORDINANCES IN VARIOUS CITIES

02:06:23.543 --> 02:06:26.712 region:rollup2

LAST YEAR.

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:29.482 region:rollup2

OF TWENTY PERCENT.

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:37.290 region:rollup2
THE SECOND WHATEVER THE INTENT

02:06:35.822 --> 02:06:37.857 region:rollup2
DEFECTIVE THAT HIGH TAX RATES

02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:40.359 region:rollup2
WILL BE TO CROWD LOCAL TAXES

WARNINGS FROM THE LEAK THAT THIS

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:53.106 region:rollup2
RATE MAY BE TOO HIGH.

02:06:51.838 --> 02:06:54.640 region:rollup2
THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF THE

02:06:53.106 --> 02:06:57.110 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATE TAX POLICY IN THIS

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:59.545 region:rollup2
AREA MAY BE A SHORT LIST

02:06:57.110 --> 02:07:00.980 region:rollup2
CONSISTING SOLELY OF THE CARTEL.

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:02.882 region:rollup2
THIS EFFECTIVELY LIMITS LOCAL

02:07:04.117 --> 02:07:08.688 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING A WITH

02:07:05.585 --> 02:07:10.356 region:rollup2
LIMITED SUCCESS.

02:07:08.688 --> 02:07:11.824 region:rollup2
THIRD THIS IS A NEW INDUSTRY AND

02:07:10.356 --> 02:07:13.459 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD NOT BE OVER BURDENED

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:15.294 region:rollup2
WITH HIGH TAXES DIRECTLY OUT OF

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:16.996 region:rollup2
THE GATE. THE MOMENT THAT THE

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:18.698 region:rollup2
REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS LOST

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:20.867 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT

02:07:18.698 --> 02:07:22.335 region:rollup2
THAT UNLIKE OTHER BUSINESSES.

02:07:20.867 --> 02:07:23.769 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A BROAD RANGE OF TAX

STATE TAX POLICY AT LEAST IN THE

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:37.083 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM SHOULD REFLECT THAT.

02:07:35.615 --> 02:07:38.251 region:rollup2
WE'RE AWARE OF LEGISLATIVE

02:07:37.083 --> 02:07:40.253 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE RELEASED A

02:07:38.251 --> 02:07:41.521 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:07:40.253 --> 02:07:42.955 region:rollup2
TO LOWER THE TAX RATE TO FIVE

02:07:41.521 --> 02:07:44.357 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO PLEASE THAT MEASURE

02:07:42.955 --> 02:07:46.058 region:rollup2
ON THE FUTURE BALLOT SINCE THE

02:07:44.357 --> 02:07:46.626 region:rollup2
CURRENT TAX RATE WAS SET BY

02:07:46.058 --> 02:07:48.394 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR SIXTY

02:07:46.626 --> 02:07:49.495 region:rollup2
FOUR.

02:07:48.394 --> 02:07:51.564 region:rollup2
THE TECH SHOULD BE LOWERED AND

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:52.899 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT CAN BE DEBATED.

02:07:51.564 --> 02:07:54.734 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH THE MORE

02:07:52.899 --> 02:07:56.302 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CHANGE IS MISSING FROM

ADJUSTMENTS IN THE TAX RATE

02:07:59.372 --> 02:08:03.042 region:rollup2
WHY?

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.477 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE SITTING

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:53.259 region:rollup2
SINCE THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:54.427 region:rollup2

POSSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:02.001 region:rollup2
REASONS

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:03.769 region:rollup2
ONE THERE ARE NEGATIVE PUBLIC

ALSO.

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:10.943 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT WILL PSYCHOTROPIC

THIS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TERMS

02:09:26.726 --> 02:09:29.662 region:rollup2
LONG AS TRACK INTERESTS IS NOT

02:09:29.662 --> 02:09:32.098 region:rollup2
THIRD IT WILL BE MANY MONTHS

02:09:30.463 --> 02:09:32.531 region:rollup2
AFTER IT IS OPERATIONAL THAT IT

02:09:32.098 --> 02:09:33.966 region:rollup2

ENFORCEABLE.

02:09:33.966 --> 02:09:36.168 region:rollup2
THE REASON FOR THIS IS A

02:09:35.001 --> 02:09:37.903 region:rollup2
PROVISION IN THE REGULATIONS

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2

WHICH WAS THERE LEGAL LIKE TO DO

02:09:52.218 --> 02:09:55.755 region:rollup2

02:09:57.289 --> 02:10:00.026 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO

HEIGHTENS ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:10:04.297 --> 02:10:07.199 region:rollup2

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:09.835 region:rollup2
ONCE PLANTS REACH EIGHT INCHES

02:10:08.401 --> 02:10:11.037 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE TAG REGARDLESS OF

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:13.306 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY ARE FLOWING BECAUSE

02:10:11.037 --> 02:10:14.473 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN COLORADO INDICATES

02:10:13.306 --> 02:10:16.142 region:rollup2
THEY WILL SURVIVE WHAT'S THE

IN THE MEANTIME.

02:10:20.146 --> 02:10:22.848 region:rollup2
THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WE NEED

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.817 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT VOLUME IN ORDER TO

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:26.085 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE MARKET DEMAND AND

I JUST PRODUCTION ACCORDINGLY.

02:10:26.085 --> 02:10:28.788 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE IT WILL TRIGGER

02:10:27.153 --> 02:10:30.089 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CONCERNS THAT WE DO NOT

ON TESTING REQUIREMENTS WE WOULD

02:10:33.693 --> 02:10:35.961 region:rollup2
URGE THE STATE'S TESTING

WHAT CONSTITUTES A YOUTH CENTER

02:11:19.505 --> 02:11:22.108 region:rollup2
WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

KNOW IF YOU GUYS ALL REALIZE

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:37.643 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BUT THERE

02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:38.611 region:rollup2
ARE INDUSTRIES AT THE LOCAL

02:13:37.643 --> 02:13:40.145 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT ARE PUTTING BALLOT

02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:40.946 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES.

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:43.015 region:rollup2
ON.

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:43.883 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BALLOTS I

02:13:43.015 --> 02:13:45.651 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WRITING THEIR OWN

02:13:43.883 --> 02:13:46.519 region:rollup2
RULES YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S A CITY

02:13:45.651 --> 02:13:47.786 region:rollup2
WITH THE BAND AND THEY DON'T

02:13:46.519 --> 02:13:49.288 region:rollup2
WANT THE BAND THEY WANT OPERATE

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.722 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES THERE THEY ARE

02:13:49.288 --> 02:13:50.923 region:rollup2
FUNDING LOCAL BALLOT

02:13:49.722 --> 02:13:52.391 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES.

02:13:50.923 --> 02:13:53.459 region:rollup2
I AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:54.426 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL TO REALLY PUTS.

02:13:53.459 --> 02:13:55.928 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT IT'S GONNA

02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:57.463 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WE

02:13:55.928 --> 02:13:57.663 region:rollup2
ARE DEALING WITH THAT AS WELL. I

02:13:57.463 --> 02:13:59.265 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:13:57.663 --> 02:14:00.132 region:rollup2
.

02:13:59.265 --> 02:14:01.100 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE FROM A COUNTIES

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:03.202 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:04.370 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE PUTTING CAPS ON HOW

02:14:03.202 --> 02:14:06.739 region:rollup2
MANY LICENSEES THEY CAN GIVE TO

02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:08.040 region:rollup2
ONE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.

02:14:06.739 --> 02:14:08.974 region:rollup2
AND THAT SORT OF GET SAID A

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.075 region:rollup2
SUMMER WOODS.

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:11.610 region:rollup2
STATEMENT ABOUT THE TOTAL

02:14:10.075 --> 02:14:13.245 region:rollup2
ACREAGE CAPS BECAUSE LOCALS CAN

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:14.246 region:rollup2
DO THAT BUT I CAN'T DO IT IF

02:14:13.245 --> 02:14:16.248 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FIGHTING A LOCAL BALLOT

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:17.349 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE BY AN INDUSTRY THAT'S

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:18.884 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN THEIR OWN RULES.

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:20.452 region:rollup2
SO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:22.254 region:rollup2
KINDA SETTING SOME FLOOR.

02:14:20.452 --> 02:14:22.821 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE

02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:25.591 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF THAT HAPPENING.

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:26.692 region:rollup2
.

02:14:25.591 --> 02:14:28.527 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AT

02:14:26.692 --> 02:14:29.862 region:rollup2
THIS LOCAL LEVELS AT THE STATE

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:30.229 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING

02:14:29.862 --> 02:14:31.397 region:rollup2
WITH OUR STATE.

02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:33.532 region:rollup2
.

02:14:31.397 --> 02:14:34.033 region:rollup2
LICENSING AGENCIES

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:35.234 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:14:34.033 --> 02:14:36.468 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT.

02:14:35.234 --> 02:14:38.671 region:rollup2
IS GONNA BE HANDLED.

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:39.772 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE.

02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:40.839 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION AND

02:14:39.772 --> 02:14:42.207 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE IT'S REALLY GONNA BE

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:43.442 region:rollup2
A PARTNERSHIP?

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:44.877 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA MAKE THAT EFFECTIVE

02:14:43.442 --> 02:14:45.477 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING A

02:14:44.877 --> 02:14:46.845 region:rollup2
SERIES MEANS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:14:45.477 --> 02:14:47.846 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT.

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:49.481 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT FEW

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:50.683 region:rollup2
MONTHS. SO I ALSO WANT THINK ALL

02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:51.850 region:rollup2
THIS THE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE

02:14:50.683 --> 02:14:52.952 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES THAT WERE UP HERE

02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:54.653 region:rollup2
EARLIER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN

02:14:52.952 --> 02:14:55.854 region:rollup2
GREAT PARTNERS SO FAR AND WE

02:14:54.653 --> 02:14:57.456 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE IN THAT.

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:58.857 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD. SO REALLY

02:14:57.456 --> 02:14:59.425 region:rollup2
QUICKLY IT KINDA TOP ISSUES FOR

02:14:58.857 --> 02:14:59.858 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT GETTING INTO

DRUG DRIVING IS STILL DEFINITELY

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:10.102 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE TOP ONE CENTER WE HAD

CHP APPEAR EARLIER TALK ABOUT.

02:15:10.102 --> 02:15:13.272 region:rollup2
DR RETRAINING AND.

02:15:11.637 --> 02:15:14.473 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS THAT THEY'VE HAD TO

02:15:13.272 --> 02:15:15.808 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DE AREA

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:16.241 region:rollup2
EXPERTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ON

02:15:15.808 --> 02:15:17.142 region:rollup2
THE FIELD ACTUALLY.

02:15:16.241 --> 02:15:19.378 region:rollup2
.

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:20.746 region:rollup2
DURING ROADSIDE TESTING.

02:15:19.378 --> 02:15:22.047 region:rollup2

MADE FOUR MILLION TRAFFIC STOPS.

02:15:31.457 --> 02:15:34.893 region:rollup2
IN ONE YEAR RECENTLY AND

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:36.195 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT YOU'RE

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:37.863 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE ENOUGH DE AREAS TO GO

02:15:36.195 --> 02:15:39.398 region:rollup2
AND RESPOND EACH ONE OF THOSE SO

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:40.499 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S GREAT AND WE NEED TO

02:15:39.398 --> 02:15:40.699 region:rollup2
KEEP GETTING THAT TRAINING OUT

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.234 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:43.569 region:rollup2
.

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:44.570 region:rollup2
NO NO ONE SHOULD BE UNDER ANY

02:15:43.569 --> 02:15:46.171 region:rollup2
FALSE PRETENSES THAT'S GOING TO

02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:48.273 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW

02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:49.942 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING A PER SE STANDARD.

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:51.744 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY TO

02:15:49.942 --> 02:15:53.078 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY IMPAIRMENT AND I GET

02:15:51.744 --> 02:15:55.047 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN.

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:56.482 region:rollup2
THE PRESENCE OF A DRUG AND IT

02:15:55.047 --> 02:15:58.384 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AND I INDICATING

02:15:56.482 --> 02:16:00.119 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT AND WE STILL NEED TO

02:15:58.384 --> 02:16:01.120 region:rollup2
FIND OUT WHAT THAT IS. BUT YOU

02:16:00.119 --> 02:16:02.221 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LAW

02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:03.655 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:16:02.221 --> 02:16:05.424 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS BODY IN

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.859 region:rollup2
THE SENATE. TO COME FOR WITH THE

02:16:05.424 --> 02:16:08.260 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THAT AND IF WE LOOK

02:16:06.859 --> 02:16:10.029 region:rollup2
AT WHAT'S HAPPENING OTHER STATES

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:11.330 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEARLY BEEN A PROBLEM. DO

02:16:10.029 --> 02:16:12.564 region:rollup2
YOU IDEAS BEEN ON THE RISE WE

02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:14.166 region:rollup2
LOOK EIGHT YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:15.701 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE FROM CALIFORNIA ABOUT

02:16:14.166 --> 02:16:17.636 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRACKING

02:16:15.701 --> 02:16:19.605 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY DON'T TRACK A.

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:21.240 region:rollup2
CANNABIS DO YOU ID AS A SEPARATE

02:16:19.605 --> 02:16:22.374 region:rollup2
STATISTICS SO IT'S HARD FOR US

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:23.676 region:rollup2
TO KNOW EXACTLY.

02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:24.877 region:rollup2
WHAT'S INCREASED AND WHAT'S HOT

02:16:23.676 --> 02:16:26.178 region:rollup2
WHAT HASN'T OVER THE LAST FEW

02:16:24.877 --> 02:16:26.678 region:rollup2
YEARS AND THAT SOME THAT WERE

02:16:26.178 --> 02:16:29.181 region:rollup2
ALSO TRYING TO WORK ON.

02:16:26.678 --> 02:16:30.616 region:rollup2
.

02:16:29.181 --> 02:16:32.051 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THAT SOMETHING

02:16:30.616 --> 02:16:32.918 region:rollup2
AS SIMPLE AS SAYING YOU KNOW A

02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:34.987 region:rollup2
MINOR.

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:36.255 region:rollup2
SOMEONE UNDER THE AGE AS THEIR

02:16:34.987 --> 02:16:37.489 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE THAT'S WHAT WE

02:16:36.255 --> 02:16:38.757 region:rollup2
HAVE FOR ALCOHOL RIGHT NOW IT

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:39.992 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO AT

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:40.993 region:rollup2
LEAST THE SAME.

02:16:39.992 --> 02:16:43.028 region:rollup2
FOR CANNABIS.

02:16:40.993 --> 02:16:43.996 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:45.097 region:rollup2
COURSE FOR THE CARVE OUT THAT

02:16:43.996 --> 02:16:48.300 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MINORS WHO HAVE

02:16:45.097 --> 02:16:48.801 region:rollup2
MEDICINE ALL. CARDS FOR USE BUT.

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:50.369 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING

02:16:48.801 --> 02:16:52.171 region:rollup2
RESEMBLING MAKES A STRONG

02:16:50.369 --> 02:16:53.138 region:rollup2
STATEMENT THAT.

02:16:52.171 --> 02:16:54.606 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE TAKE THIS ISSUE

02:16:53.138 --> 02:16:56.141 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY.

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:57.943 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S ARGUMENT

02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:59.011 region:rollup2

02:16:57.943 --> 02:17:01.213 region:rollup2
DRIVING LOOKS LIKE.

02:16:59.011 --> 02:17:02.614 region:rollup2
.

02:17:01.213 --> 02:17:03.148 region:rollup2
BUT SURELY THERE'S A POINT WHERE

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.316 region:rollup2
IT'S GONE TOO FAR AND IT'S

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:05.584 region:rollup2
UNSAFE.

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:06.785 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WE CAN ARGUE WHERE

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:08.020 region:rollup2
THAT LINE IS BUT SURELY THERE'S

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:09.922 region:rollup2
A POINT WHERE IT'S GOING TO SAVE

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.189 region:rollup2
TO FOREIGN IT'S UNSAFE WE HAVE

02:17:09.922 --> 02:17:13.425 region:rollup2

PERCEPTION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:21.100 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

02:17:19.798 --> 02:17:22.367 region:rollup2
IT'S FINE AS THEY CAN TO A

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:23.936 region:rollup2

IT'S IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE AND IT

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:02.975 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS SUCH.

02:18:00.606 --> 02:18:04.676 region:rollup2

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT DOING.

02:23:42.147 --> 02:23:46.151 region:rollup2
THE ILLEGAL ENFORCER WE HEARD

FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE'S

02:23:46.151 --> 02:23:49.187 region:rollup2

A LOCAL ON FORCE WHAT ARE SOME

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:52.824 region:rollup2
OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:54.392 region:rollup2
WITH THAT RELIANCE.

02:23:52.824 --> 02:23:54.793 region:rollup2
I MEAN DIFFERENT RESOURCES I

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:56.528 region:rollup2
MEAN WE'RE STILL.

02:23:54.793 --> 02:23:59.931 region:rollup2
.

02:23:56.528 --> 02:24:01.032 region:rollup2
OPERATING ON ON THIN BUDGETS.

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:02.701 region:rollup2
AGAIN WITH A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

02:24:01.032 --> 02:24:03.768 region:rollup2
THEN YOU THROW THIS ON TOP OF IT

02:24:02.701 --> 02:24:04.736 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME AREAS

02:24:03.768 --> 02:24:06.438 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:08.073 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LOCAL TAXES AND AND

02:24:06.438 --> 02:24:09.374 region:rollup2
BUILD A. STRONG MARIJUANA

02:24:08.073 --> 02:24:10.809 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS.

02:24:09.374 --> 02:24:12.177 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR RANKS BUT THAT'S

02:24:10.809 --> 02:24:13.612 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE DONE EVERYWHERE

02:24:12.177 --> 02:24:14.846 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY POSSIBLE EVERYWHERE.

02:24:13.612 --> 02:24:17.215 region:rollup2
SO.

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:18.583 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:24:17.215 --> 02:24:19.851 region:rollup2
I THINK ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING

02:24:18.583 --> 02:24:21.486 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT WE LOOK AT.

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:23.221 region:rollup2
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING

02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:24.589 region:rollup2
WIDE THAT WE DON'T SEPARATE IT

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:26.258 region:rollup2
AND PUT IT SOLELY INTO THE HANDS

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:27.459 region:rollup2
OF ONE STATE AGENCY OR SOUL INTO

02:24:26.258 --> 02:24:27.993 region:rollup2
THE HANDS OF LOCAL LAW

02:24:27.459 --> 02:24:28.460 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE A

02:24:27.993 --> 02:24:30.295 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP?

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:31.530 region:rollup2
?

02:24:30.295 --> 02:24:33.331 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:34.833 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I.

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:37.335 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES WHEN THEY'RE THERE

02:24:34.833 --> 02:24:38.637 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY.

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:40.272 region:rollup2
SOME I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY

02:24:38.637 --> 02:24:41.239 region:rollup2
THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM TOO IS.

02:24:40.272 --> 02:24:42.741 region:rollup2
IS THE FACT THAT.

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:44.109 region:rollup2
SO MAYES INVESTIGATIONS ARE

02:24:42.741 --> 02:24:45.076 region:rollup2
QUITE COMPLEX.

02:24:44.109 --> 02:24:47.245 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRED ADDITIONAL

02:24:45.076 --> 02:24:49.648 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND AND COOPERATION

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:50.215 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES.

02:24:49.648 --> 02:24:52.150 region:rollup2
MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE.

02:24:50.215 --> 02:24:53.852 region:rollup2
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LAW

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:54.686 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT RURAL AREAS HAVE THE

02:24:53.852 --> 02:24:57.022 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO DO THE.

02:24:54.686 --> 02:24:58.523 region:rollup2

AND TROUBLESOME ISSUE AND IT'S

02:25:15.807 --> 02:25:18.910 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:19.911 region:rollup2
IT'S A RESOURCES QUESTION BUT

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:22.581 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO.

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:24.182 region:rollup2
DE. WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL

FOR THAT MATTER AND IT'S REALLY

02:25:25.717 --> 02:25:29.187 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE REGULATED SPACE

TO DEAL WITH THE BLACK MARKET

02:25:34.659 --> 02:25:37.295 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:39.898 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN BOLSTER THE REGULATED

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:41.299 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN

02:25:39.898 --> 02:25:43.168 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES THERE'S THERE'S

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:44.869 region:rollup2
WAIT OVER BY A FOR THE MOST PART

02:25:43.168 --> 02:25:47.005 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY I OUT IN THE NATIONAL

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:49.040 region:rollup2
FORESTS IN OTHER. AREAS. THEIR

02:25:47.005 --> 02:25:50.342 region:rollup2
TWO VERY SEPARATE ISSUES AND WE

AGAINST THOSE. THOSE ILLEGAL

02:25:53.912 --> 02:25:57.515 region:rollup2
GROWS.

02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:58.950 region:rollup2
CITIES DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES

02:25:57.515 --> 02:26:00.518 region:rollup2
BY AND LARGE TO ENGAGE IN

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:02.420 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT AND

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:03.855 region:rollup2
IT'S A GOING FORWARD THAT CAN BE

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:05.824 region:rollup2
A MAJOR PROBLEM ONE OF THE

02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:06.992 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. THE

02:26:05.824 --> 02:26:08.760 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL VERY EAGER TO

02:26:06.992 --> 02:26:09.928 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE'S ON THE SEQUEL

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:11.630 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION SO LONG AS IT IS A

02:26:09.928 --> 02:26:12.697 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY PROCESS A LOT OF

02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:14.165 region:rollup2
THEM ARE VERY RELIEVED WHEN THEY

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:15.367 region:rollup2
HEAR THAT. IN THE BRIEFINGS THAT

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:17.302 region:rollup2
WE'VE GIVEN IN VARIOUS CITIES

02:26:15.367 --> 02:26:19.137 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE. ANOTHER ISSUE

02:26:17.302 --> 02:26:19.437 region:rollup2
ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE IS THE

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:22.173 region:rollup2
FACT THAT.

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:23.575 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE RESPONSE.

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:25.577 region:rollup2

02:26:23.575 --> 02:26:25.944 region:rollup2
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

02:26:25.577 --> 02:26:28.113 region:rollup2
THE.

02:26:25.944 --> 02:26:29.147 region:rollup2
MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT

02:26:28.113 --> 02:26:30.949 region:rollup2

FROM CULTIVATION WITHIN THE CITY

02:26:32.484 --> 02:26:36.021 region:rollup2
LIMITS SO THERE'S A.

02:26:34.319 --> 02:26:37.088 region:rollup2
A BIT OF CONCERN BORDERING ON

02:26:36.021 --> 02:26:38.256 region:rollup2
PANIC IN SOME JURISDICTIONS

02:26:37.088 --> 02:26:39.357 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS A QUESTION

02:26:38.256 --> 02:26:40.825 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:41.059 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPACITY.

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:42.627 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:26:41.059 --> 02:26:44.062 region:rollup2
THOSE TREATMENTS ARE IS GONNA

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:46.564 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THE FOR

02:26:44.062 --> 02:26:49.067 region:rollup2

KNOW WHAT WHAT SKILL OF

02:26:51.603 --> 02:26:54.806 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BUT

TROUBLING QUESTION. FOR CITY.

KIND OF ALONG THE SAME.

02:27:11.089 --> 02:27:14.526 region:rollup2
LINES.

02:27:12.157 --> 02:27:16.027 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE ARE.

02:27:14.526 --> 02:27:17.829 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES THERE'S

02:27:16.027 --> 02:27:19.764 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LOCAL LAND USE

02:27:17.829 --> 02:27:22.701 region:rollup2

MARIJUANA BUT WE STILL HAVE A

02:27:28.006 --> 02:27:31.109 region:rollup2
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST NOT.

02:27:29.541 --> 02:27:34.212 region:rollup2
REFUSING TO COMPLY.

WHO CAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHICH

02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:40.785 region:rollup2
I THINK WE JUST IDENTIFIED

02:27:39.284 --> 02:27:42.520 region:rollup2
THERE'S?

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:43.688 region:rollup2

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:48.159 region:rollup2
REALLY THIN.

02:27:45.824 --> 02:27:50.228 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WHO CAN

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:52.197 region:rollup2

GROWS.

02:27:58.703 --> 02:28:00.972 region:rollup2
I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S A

02:27:59.604 --> 02:28:02.707 region:rollup2
PARTNER ENFORCEMENT IS A

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:04.442 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR LOCAL

02:28:02.707 --> 02:28:05.977 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:07.312 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A DUAL LICENSING PROGRAM

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:09.414 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA SO.

02:28:07.312 --> 02:28:10.915 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE COMMUNICATING

02:28:09.414 --> 02:28:11.449 region:rollup2
WITH ONE ANOTHER AT THE LOCAL

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:14.018 region:rollup2
LEVEL ON WITHIN THE STATE

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:14.652 region:rollup2
REGULATORY. AGENCIES IN ADDITION

02:28:14.018 --> 02:28:17.021 region:rollup2

02:28:14.652 --> 02:28:18.289 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT

02:28:17.021 --> 02:28:20.391 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:22.460 region:rollup2
FOR THE INDUSTRY TO PLAY AS WERE

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:24.496 region:rollup2
ASKING FOLKS TO COME OUT OF THE

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.230 region:rollup2
GRAY AND BLACK MARKET PLACE AND

02:28:24.496 --> 02:28:28.466 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN.

02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:30.268 region:rollup2
QUITE COMPLEX REGULATORY SCHEME.

02:28:28.466 --> 02:28:31.803 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ACTORS GOOD ACTORS

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:33.271 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DOING SO AND OTHERS

02:28:31.803 --> 02:28:34.205 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNDERCUTTING THEM BY NOT

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:35.740 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING.

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:36.374 region:rollup2
IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND I DO

02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:37.609 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:39.244 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WILL BE A

02:28:37.609 --> 02:28:40.345 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:28:39.244 --> 02:28:42.881 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN.

02:28:40.345 --> 02:28:44.682 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE

02:28:42.881 --> 02:28:47.018 region:rollup2
COMPLIANT INDUSTRY TO REALLY

02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:48.853 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHO IS NOT COMPLIANCE

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:51.589 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM INTO THE

02:28:48.853 --> 02:28:52.857 region:rollup2
REGULATED SPACE.

02:28:51.589 --> 02:28:54.659 region:rollup2
NO I WOULD ECHO MS MARTIN'S

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:55.627 region:rollup2

02:28:55.627 --> 02:28:59.230 region:rollup2
CIRCLE THE WAGONS THAT PUT

02:28:56.895 --> 02:29:00.465 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AS BEST THEY CAN A

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.466 region:rollup2
SEAMLESS WEB OF ENFORCEMENT.

02:29:00.465 --> 02:29:03.168 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IN THE MORE EGREGIOUS

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:04.936 region:rollup2
CASES IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO

02:29:03.168 --> 02:29:06.204 region:rollup2
CALL ON THE THE THE CULT WE

AND SO WHERE YOU. LOCALS ARE IN

02:29:13.444 --> 02:29:15.747 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF COMING UP WITH

CREATIVE SOLUTIONS

02:29:15.747 --> 02:29:20.518 region:rollup2

ILLEGAL GROWS THAT MIGHT BE OUT

BEGIN WITH YOU.

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:18.569 region:rollup2
MISTER THACKER.

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:20.338 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING.

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:23.041 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS LARRY THACKER AND I'M

02:31:20.338 --> 02:31:25.343 region:rollup2
THE CEO OF KHALIFA BASED IN SAN

02:31:23.041 --> 02:31:27.278 region:rollup2
JOSE. ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:31:25.343 --> 02:31:28.880 region:rollup2
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CANNABIS

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:31.349 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS IN THE STATE.

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:32.850 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:34.519 region:rollup2
SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT

02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:37.221 region:rollup2
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL

02:31:34.519 --> 02:31:38.089 region:rollup2
CANNABIS LAWS.

02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:40.525 region:rollup2
FIRST LET ME EXPRESS MY

02:31:38.089 --> 02:31:42.260 region:rollup2
APPRECIATION FOR THE HARD WORK

02:31:40.525 --> 02:31:44.762 region:rollup2
AND PREPARATION BY ALL THREE

02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:45.697 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AGENCIES.

02:31:44.762 --> 02:31:48.066 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAIN

02:31:45.697 --> 02:31:49.133 region:rollup2
WRECK OF HORRIFIC PROPORTIONS?

02:31:48.066 --> 02:31:51.002 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SMOOTH

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:52.937 region:rollup2
SAILING.

02:31:51.002 --> 02:31:54.872 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:56.507 region:rollup2
ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL. BUMPS IN

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:58.409 region:rollup2
THE ROAD AND IN THE FEW MINUTES

02:31:56.507 --> 02:32:00.345 region:rollup2
I HAVE TODAY. I WILL FOCUS ON

02:31:58.409 --> 02:32:02.814 region:rollup2
THREE OF THOSE.

02:32:00.345 --> 02:32:04.349 region:rollup2
FIRST AND MOST PROBLEMATIC IS

02:32:02.814 --> 02:32:07.151 region:rollup2
THE BUREAU'S DECISION TO

02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:08.953 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THE STATUE IN A WAY.

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:10.521 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES AN IMPERMEABLE

02:32:08.953 --> 02:32:12.056 region:rollup2
FIREWALL

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:14.192 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ADULT USE AND MEDICAL

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:15.293 region:rollup2
USE.

02:32:14.192 --> 02:32:16.928 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR

02:32:15.293 --> 02:32:18.296 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION IS SUPPORTED BY

02:32:16.928 --> 02:32:19.931 region:rollup2
THE UNDERLYING STATUTE BUT IN

02:32:18.296 --> 02:32:22.300 region:rollup2
ANY CASE.

02:32:19.931 --> 02:32:25.470 region:rollup2
THE REGULATION ADVERSELY AFFECTS

02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:26.971 region:rollup2
THE COR OF CANNABIS OPERATIONS.

02:32:25.470 --> 02:32:29.407 region:rollup2
THE REGULATION REQUIRES THAT A

02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:31.943 region:rollup2
CANNABIS PLANT IN ITS INFANCY.

02:32:29.407 --> 02:32:34.112 region:rollup2
MUST BE DESIGNATED TO FOLLOW AN

02:32:31.943 --> 02:32:36.014 region:rollup2
ADULT USE PATHWAY OR A MEDICAL

02:32:34.112 --> 02:32:37.515 region:rollup2
USE PATHWAY.

02:32:36.014 --> 02:32:39.283 region:rollup2
FROM THAT POINT THERE IS

02:32:37.515 --> 02:32:40.985 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO OPPORTUNITY.

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:42.620 region:rollup2
FOR THE PLANT TO MOVE FROM ONE

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:44.555 region:rollup2
PATH TO THE OTHER.

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:46.724 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT IS CLEAR THAT THE

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:49.861 region:rollup2
MARKET DEMANDS FOR THAT PLAN ARE

02:32:46.724 --> 02:32:51.496 region:rollup2
CONTRARY TO THE PLANTS PATHWAY.

02:32:49.861 --> 02:32:54.032 region:rollup2
THE RESULT AS THE MARKET OF

02:32:51.496 --> 02:32:55.533 region:rollup2
BALLS IS INESCAPABLE.

02:32:54.032 --> 02:32:56.601 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE AGLUT IN ONE OF

02:32:55.533 --> 02:32:58.603 region:rollup2
THE MARKETS IN A SHORTAGE IN THE

02:32:56.601 --> 02:33:00.805 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:32:58.603 --> 02:33:01.305 region:rollup2
MOST MEDICAL CANNABIS CONSUMERS

02:33:00.805 --> 02:33:03.241 region:rollup2
WILL FIND THAT THE SLIM

02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:04.542 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:33:03.241 --> 02:33:07.245 region:rollup2
TO BEING A MEDICAL CANNABIS

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:09.080 region:rollup2
PATIENT FAR OUTWEIGH. BY THE

02:33:07.245 --> 02:33:11.382 region:rollup2
SIMPLICITY OF BEING AN ADULT USE

02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:12.817 region:rollup2
CONSUMER.

02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:15.319 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY WILL FIND FAR

02:33:12.817 --> 02:33:18.022 region:rollup2
GREATER PROFITS ON THE ADULT USE

02:33:15.319 --> 02:33:20.692 region:rollup2
PATHWAY. AND CHOOSE TO DIRECT.

02:33:18.022 --> 02:33:22.827 region:rollup2
ALL OF ITS ALL OR NEARLY ALL OF

02:33:20.692 --> 02:33:23.928 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCT TO ADULT USE.

02:33:22.827 --> 02:33:25.396 region:rollup2
THAT WILL LEAVE THOSE

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:27.065 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WHO REMAIN MEDICAL

02:33:25.396 --> 02:33:28.966 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WITH VERY LIMITED

02:33:27.065 --> 02:33:31.202 region:rollup2
SUPPLY.

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:32.270 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FACTOR IS INESCAPABLE.

02:33:31.202 --> 02:33:34.505 region:rollup2
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:37.175 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADULT USE

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:38.676 region:rollup2
CANNABIS AND IT ADULT USE

02:33:37.175 --> 02:33:40.645 region:rollup2
CANNABIS AND PRODUCTS.

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:42.146 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAL CANNABIS AND

02:33:40.645 --> 02:33:44.182 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS IN THE MANUFACTURING

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:46.651 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:33:44.182 --> 02:33:48.119 region:rollup2
OR IN THE CULTIVATION.

02:33:46.651 --> 02:33:51.456 region:rollup2
AND TO CONTINUE ARGUE THAT THERE

02:33:48.119 --> 02:33:53.224 region:rollup2
IS IS TO PERPETUATE A FICTION.

02:33:51.456 --> 02:33:55.860 region:rollup2
THE REGULATION MUST BE CHANGED

02:33:53.224 --> 02:33:57.161 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ALLOW ADULT USE AND

02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:58.429 region:rollup2
MEDICAL USE LICENSES.

02:33:57.161 --> 02:34:00.932 region:rollup2
TO CONDUCT BUSINESS

02:33:58.429 --> 02:34:02.400 region:rollup2
WITH EACH OTHER.

02:34:00.932 --> 02:34:03.701 region:rollup2
SECOND FOR ST NEEDS TO TAKE A

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:05.670 region:rollup2
CLOSE HARD LOOK IT THE

02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:06.170 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE. TAX OBLIGATIONS

02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:08.873 region:rollup2
IMPOSED ON THE CANNABIS

02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:10.675 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:34:08.873 --> 02:34:11.976 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT IS A CANNABIS AND

02:34:10.675 --> 02:34:13.177 region:rollup2
THAT AS CANNABIS COMES INTO THE

02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:16.481 region:rollup2
LIGHT.

02:34:13.177 --> 02:34:18.249 region:rollup2
PAYING ITS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.

02:34:16.481 --> 02:34:20.518 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENS THE LEGITIMACY.

02:34:18.249 --> 02:34:22.754 region:rollup2
AS US.

02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:24.388 region:rollup2
AS A CALIFORNIA AND HISTORY.

02:34:22.754 --> 02:34:26.390 region:rollup2
THE TAX POLICY CHALLENGES

02:34:24.388 --> 02:34:28.392 region:rollup2
ASSESSING OUT WHAT TIPPING POINT

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:31.295 region:rollup2
THE CUMULATIVE TAXATION.

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:32.663 region:rollup2
BECOMES AN UNDUE BURDEN.

02:34:31.295 --> 02:34:34.332 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE

02:34:32.663 --> 02:34:35.833 region:rollup2
CULTIVATION TAX.

02:34:34.332 --> 02:34:37.869 region:rollup2
EXCISE TAX

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:40.338 region:rollup2
SALES TAX.

02:34:37.869 --> 02:34:41.873 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX

02:34:40.338 --> 02:34:43.241 region:rollup2
THE TAX OBLIGATION APPROACH IS

02:34:41.873 --> 02:34:45.576 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT IN MANY

02:34:43.241 --> 02:34:47.712 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

02:34:45.576 --> 02:34:49.046 region:rollup2
AGGRAVATING THAT BURDEN IS THE

02:34:47.712 --> 02:34:50.414 region:rollup2
IRONIC DECISION BY THE FEDERAL

02:34:49.046 --> 02:34:52.150 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THAT CANNABIS

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:53.017 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES MUST STILL PAY

02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:55.286 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAXES.

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:56.754 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

02:34:55.286 --> 02:34:59.190 region:rollup2
UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

02:34:56.754 --> 02:35:00.558 region:rollup2
SECTION TWO EIGHTY E..

02:34:59.190 --> 02:35:02.093 region:rollup2
A CANNABIS BUSINESS CANNOT

02:35:00.558 --> 02:35:04.028 region:rollup2
DEDUCT

02:35:02.093 --> 02:35:06.931 region:rollup2
THE SAME BUSINESS EXPENSES BUT

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:09.700 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY CAN.

02:35:06.931 --> 02:35:12.103 region:rollup2
SO OUR FEDERAL TAX BURDEN IS

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:14.705 region:rollup2
MUCH GREATER THAN EVERY OTHER

02:35:12.103 --> 02:35:15.807 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:17.642 region:rollup2
IF WE AS A STATE ARE TO BE

02:35:15.807 --> 02:35:19.277 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE

02:35:17.642 --> 02:35:21.679 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE OPERATED FOR YEARS IN A

02:35:19.277 --> 02:35:23.881 region:rollup2
GRAY MARKET. TO COME FULLY INTO

02:35:21.679 --> 02:35:25.583 region:rollup2
THE LEGAL MARKET. WE MUST BE

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:27.451 region:rollup2
CAREFUL TO AVOID CUMULATIVE TAX

02:35:25.583 --> 02:35:28.953 region:rollup2
POLICY.

02:35:27.451 --> 02:35:30.888 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE VIEWED BY ANY

02:35:28.953 --> 02:35:32.890 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AS EXCESSIVE.

02:35:30.888 --> 02:35:34.225 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:35.960 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF ITS SUCCESSES IN

02:35:34.225 --> 02:35:37.929 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A RATIONAL REGULATORY

02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.864 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THE STATE IS NOT

02:35:37.929 --> 02:35:41.132 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

02:35:39.864 --> 02:35:43.034 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INDUSTRY

02:35:41.132 --> 02:35:45.069 region:rollup2
WORKS.

02:35:43.034 --> 02:35:47.838 region:rollup2
A PRIMARY CASE IN POINT IS THE

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:49.807 region:rollup2
ABSENCE IN THE REGULATION OF ANY

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:51.676 region:rollup2
DIRECTION OR ALLOWANCE FOR

02:35:49.807 --> 02:35:52.844 region:rollup2

02:35:52.844 --> 02:36:09.927 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

02:36:07.892 --> 02:36:11.829 region:rollup2
LIKE MANY INDUSTRIES ENGAGED IN

02:36:09.927 --> 02:36:13.197 region:rollup2
A CONSUMER BASED PRODUCT.

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:14.532 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MARKET OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN.

02:36:15.1000 --> 02:36:19.637 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY SHARING

02:36:17.935 --> 02:36:21.606 region:rollup2
SAMPLES WITH POTENTIAL BUSINESS

02:36:19.637 --> 02:36:23.174 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

02:36:21.606 --> 02:36:25.042 region:rollup2
WHEN OUR SALES REPRESENTATIVE

02:36:23.174 --> 02:36:27.111 region:rollup2

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:28.512 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL RETAIL VENDOR HERE SHE

MUST BE ABLE TO SHOW THE VENDOR

THE PRODUCT.

02:36:29.981 --> 02:36:33.484 region:rollup2
A SALES REP IS SELLING AND ALLOW

02:36:32.016 --> 02:36:35.419 region:rollup2
THE VENDOR TO HAVE A SAMPLE OF

THE PRODUCT.

02:36:35.419 --> 02:36:39.490 region:rollup2
THE REGULATIONS ARE COMPLETELY

02:36:37.154 --> 02:36:39.991 region:rollup2
SAYA SILENT ON MARKETING FROM

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:42.393 region:rollup2
LICENSEE TO LICENSE ANY

02:36:42.393 --> 02:36:46.264 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE OTHER REGULATIONS

02:36:44.161 --> 02:36:48.299 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO GUIDE TO SEE TO SAIL

02:36:46.264 --> 02:36:50.034 region:rollup2
PATH OF THE PRODUCT THAT ON

02:36:48.299 --> 02:36:51.202 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY INTERFERE WITH THE

WELL WE URGE THE STATE TO

02:36:55.773 --> 02:36:58.476 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MARKETING

02:36:57.008 --> 02:37:00.211 region:rollup2
SOON.

02:36:58.476 --> 02:37:02.146 region:rollup2
THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO SPEND

02:37:00.211 --> 02:37:03.748 region:rollup2
TIME WITH THE INDUSTRY ON OTHER

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:05.316 region:rollup2
DISCRETE ISSUES.

02:37:03.748 --> 02:37:07.451 region:rollup2
WHERE THE REGULATIONS DO NOT

02:37:05.316 --> 02:37:09.420 region:rollup2
MATCH TRADITIONAL OPERATIONAL

02:37:07.451 --> 02:37:11.689 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVES OF ANY OTHER

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:12.223 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY?

02:37:11.689 --> 02:37:13.624 region:rollup2
I HOPE THESE THOUGHTS ARE

02:37:12.223 --> 02:37:15.626 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

02:37:13.624 --> 02:37:17.361 region:rollup2
WE ALL STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO

SUMMER.

02:37:54.899 --> 02:37:57.435 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR ARE THREE CRAP FARMS

02:37:57.234 --> 02:37:58.970 region:rollup2
WERE.

02:37:57.435 --> 02:38:00.404 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT TO THREE QUICK.

COTTAGE LICENSES WE ARE VERY

02:38:02.907 --> 02:38:05.543 region:rollup2
SMALL.

02:38:03.407 --> 02:38:06.577 region:rollup2
TOTAL VEGETABLE CULTIVATION OF

02:38:06.577 --> 02:38:09.513 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OUR FARMS.

02:38:08.079 --> 02:38:10.581 region:rollup2
I GROWN SO THAT'S DOUBLES MY

02:38:09.513 --> 02:38:12.583 region:rollup2
TOTAL REQUIREMENT IS THAT I GET

02:38:10.581 --> 02:38:14.385 region:rollup2
A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR PERMIT FROM

02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:15.019 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

THAT LISTS THE CROPS THAT I WANT

02:38:15.019 --> 02:38:18.022 region:rollup2
TO SELL.

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:19.623 region:rollup2
COMPARE THAT WITH THE TENS OF

02:38:18.022 --> 02:38:21.158 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT SMALL

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:23.561 region:rollup2
CANNABIS FARMS ARE UP AGAINST

02:38:21.158 --> 02:38:25.396 region:rollup2
FOR LAND USE REGULATIONS AND

02:38:23.561 --> 02:38:26.664 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE COSTS AND IT'S A.

02:38:25.396 --> 02:38:27.798 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A LARGE DISPARITY

02:38:26.664 --> 02:38:30.434 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES LOOKING IT OVER A

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:31.936 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:38:30.434 --> 02:38:34.038 region:rollup2
WE WE ARE FARMERS IT IS IS OUR

02:38:31.936 --> 02:38:35.773 region:rollup2
CALLING WE LOVE IT THIS IS THIS

02:38:34.038 --> 02:38:37.341 region:rollup2
IS ALL WE'VE EVER WANTED TO DO

TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE

02:38:37.975 --> 02:38:40.778 region:rollup2
FARM.

02:38:39.377 --> 02:38:43.047 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT

02:38:40.778 --> 02:38:44.448 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I OF THE LICENSING AND

02:38:43.047 --> 02:38:46.217 region:rollup2
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS EIGHT

02:38:44.448 --> 02:38:47.618 region:rollup2
MOST OF THAT UP. I WAS LUCKY

02:38:46.217 --> 02:38:49.186 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO FIND AN OFF FARM JOB

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:50.087 region:rollup2

02:38:49.186 --> 02:38:51.455 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO

02:38:50.087 --> 02:38:52.890 region:rollup2
CELEBRATE THAT THE FACT THAT I

HAVE A TEMPORARY STAY LICENSE

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:57.028 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE MOST

02:38:54.492 --> 02:38:58.329 region:rollup2
OF MY COMMUNITY DOES NOT.

02:38:57.028 --> 02:39:00.364 region:rollup2
I'M HERE TODAY ON YOUR GRAVE

02:38:58.329 --> 02:39:01.198 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES THE IMPACT OF

02:39:00.364 --> 02:39:02.333 region:rollup2
THESE REGULATIONS ON OUR

02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:04.668 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY'S IS

02:39:02.333 --> 02:39:06.037 region:rollup2
DRASTIC.

02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:07.571 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF JOBS OFTEN

02:39:06.037 --> 02:39:09.106 region:rollup2
JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY ON A LOT

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:10.041 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE NO IDEA

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:11.142 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY CAN'T

02:39:10.041 --> 02:39:13.310 region:rollup2
GET A LICENSE.

02:39:11.142 --> 02:39:15.346 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T GET A LICENSE.

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:16.647 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN A CRISIS.

02:39:15.346 --> 02:39:17.948 region:rollup2
THIS EMERGENCY IS CAUSED BY

02:39:16.647 --> 02:39:19.517 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PAPER CUTS NOT BY A

02:39:17.948 --> 02:39:20.684 region:rollup2
SINGLE WOUND.

02:39:19.517 --> 02:39:22.953 region:rollup2
AS SUCH WILL BE ESPECIALLY

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:23.587 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO CORRECT.

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:25.156 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS

02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:26.457 region:rollup2
TO ENTRY AS IT STANDS TODAY

02:39:25.156 --> 02:39:27.525 region:rollup2
NEARLY ALL OF THE BUSINESSES

02:39:26.457 --> 02:39:29.460 region:rollup2
OPERATING WILL FAIL IN THE NEXT

02:39:27.525 --> 02:39:30.661 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:32.029 region:rollup2
IF YOU TAKE ACTION AND REDUCE

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:33.998 region:rollup2
THESE BARRIERS MORE BUSINESSES

02:39:32.029 --> 02:39:35.733 region:rollup2
WILL SURVIVE.

02:39:33.998 --> 02:39:36.300 region:rollup2
YOU DO NOT WE NEED TO START

02:39:35.733 --> 02:39:38.269 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT SOCIAL SAFETY

02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:39.637 region:rollup2
NETS.

02:39:38.269 --> 02:39:41.005 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ACCESS TO BANKS ARE

02:39:39.637 --> 02:39:42.106 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ARE SERIOUSLY LIMITED

02:39:41.005 --> 02:39:43.908 region:rollup2
THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO COVER

02:39:42.106 --> 02:39:45.876 region:rollup2
ONE TIME COSTS.

02:39:43.908 --> 02:39:47.645 region:rollup2
WE NEED ACCESS TO SMALL BUSINESS

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:49.713 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO HELP

02:39:47.645 --> 02:39:51.615 region:rollup2
STABILIZE NOT GROWTH ORIENTED

02:39:49.713 --> 02:39:53.317 region:rollup2
VENTURE CAPITAL.

02:39:51.615 --> 02:39:54.652 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE MUST ENSURE THAT

02:39:53.317 --> 02:39:55.719 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES

02:39:54.652 --> 02:39:57.588 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO COVER ONE TIME

02:39:55.719 --> 02:39:59.723 region:rollup2
REGULATORY COSTS.

02:39:57.588 --> 02:40:01.225 region:rollup2
OR GIVE US LONGER TIMELINES TO

02:39:59.723 --> 02:40:03.494 region:rollup2
COMPLY SO WE CAN SPREAD THESE

02:40:01.225 --> 02:40:04.829 region:rollup2
COST OVER MULTIPLE HARVESTS.

02:40:03.494 --> 02:40:06.163 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S A BIG STATE

02:40:04.829 --> 02:40:07.865 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ALL OVER ARE FACING

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:09.433 region:rollup2
SIMILAR IMPACTS.

02:40:07.865 --> 02:40:10.634 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND BARRIERS

02:40:09.433 --> 02:40:12.837 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BUT THE

02:40:10.634 --> 02:40:13.838 region:rollup2
URGENCY IS THE SAME.

02:40:12.837 --> 02:40:15.172 region:rollup2
ONE IS YOU THAT IS ESPECIALLY

02:40:13.838 --> 02:40:16.140 region:rollup2
PRONOUNCED ON THE NORTH COAST IS

02:40:15.172 --> 02:40:17.775 region:rollup2
THE CANNABIS FARMERS ARE BEING

02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:20.010 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO COVER COSTS OF CLEAN

02:40:17.775 --> 02:40:22.146 region:rollup2
UP FOR LEGACY ISSUES THAT EXIST

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:23.681 region:rollup2
ON OR NEAR OUR FARMS. BUT THAT

02:40:22.146 --> 02:40:24.982 region:rollup2
WE DID NOT CAUSE AND ARE NOT

02:40:23.681 --> 02:40:26.350 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY RELATED TO CANNABIS

02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:27.251 region:rollup2
CULTIVATION.

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:28.586 region:rollup2
THERE IS GREAT UNFAIRNESS TO THE

02:40:27.251 --> 02:40:29.687 region:rollup2
COSTS.

02:40:28.586 --> 02:40:30.621 region:rollup2
IT'S AS THOUGH THE REGULATIONS

02:40:29.687 --> 02:40:32.957 region:rollup2
ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

02:40:30.621 --> 02:40:34.825 region:rollup2
ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF THE PAST

02:40:32.957 --> 02:40:36.827 region:rollup2
TIMBER BLOOM ON THE BACKS OF

02:40:34.825 --> 02:40:38.295 region:rollup2
SMALL CANNABIS FARMERS.

02:40:36.827 --> 02:40:39.530 region:rollup2
PROVIDING MULTI YEAR TIMELINES

02:40:38.295 --> 02:40:40.831 region:rollup2
FOR REMEDIATION WOULD HELP

02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:42.266 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT FARMERS ABLE TO MAKE

02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:45.136 region:rollup2
THE TRANSITION TO THE REGULATED

02:40:42.266 --> 02:40:45.636 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE. WHILE ALSO ENSURING

02:40:45.136 --> 02:40:47.505 region:rollup2
THAT RESTORATION WORK IS

02:40:45.636 --> 02:40:48.772 region:rollup2
COMPLETED.

02:40:47.505 --> 02:40:50.074 region:rollup2
THE COST OF TRANSITION IS SO

02:40:48.772 --> 02:40:50.908 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE THAT MANY PHARMACY

02:40:50.074 --> 02:40:52.343 region:rollup2
SCALING UP IS THE ONLY WAY TO

02:40:50.908 --> 02:40:53.344 region:rollup2
SUCCEED.

02:40:52.343 --> 02:40:55.613 region:rollup2
AND INVESTORS ARE QUICK TO

02:40:53.344 --> 02:40:56.747 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THIS.

02:40:55.613 --> 02:40:58.048 region:rollup2
MY FARM IS THE SIZE IT WANTS TO

02:40:56.747 --> 02:41:00.651 region:rollup2
BE.

02:40:58.048 --> 02:41:03.320 region:rollup2
I AM THE FARMER I WANT TO BE.

02:41:00.651 --> 02:41:03.888 region:rollup2
I CANNOT SCALE UP.

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.723 region:rollup2
IF REGULATION IS GOING TO

02:41:03.888 --> 02:41:06.891 region:rollup2
SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA

02:41:05.723 --> 02:41:08.559 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS MUST LEVEL THE

02:41:06.891 --> 02:41:10.361 region:rollup2
PLAYING FIELD SO THAT EVERYONE

02:41:08.559 --> 02:41:12.329 region:rollup2
HAS A CHANCE TO SUCCEED.

02:41:10.361 --> 02:41:13.631 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL.

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:15.599 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS NO PATHWAY TO

02:41:13.631 --> 02:41:16.800 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND NO OTHER JOBS

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:18.502 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL STAY IN THE ILLEGAL

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:19.470 region:rollup2
MARKET PLACE.

02:41:18.502 --> 02:41:19.970 region:rollup2
AND FORCE MEANT WITHOUT

02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:22.907 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY IS A BROKEN

02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:26.043 region:rollup2
PARADIGM.

02:41:22.907 --> 02:41:27.478 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING THIS CAN STILL WORK.

02:41:26.043 --> 02:41:29.446 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED SYSTEMATIC

02:41:27.478 --> 02:41:31.148 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS TO REDUCE

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:32.917 region:rollup2
BARRIERS AND ENSURE THAT AS MANY

02:41:31.148 --> 02:41:34.118 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AS POSSIBLE CAN AND

02:41:32.917 --> 02:41:35.886 region:rollup2
TO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE.

02:41:34.118 --> 02:41:37.188 region:rollup2
FOR ME.

02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:38.055 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE REGULATION IN OUR

02:41:37.188 --> 02:41:39.890 region:rollup2
STATE WILL BE DIRECTLY

02:41:38.055 --> 02:41:41.325 region:rollup2
CORRELATED TO HOW WIDESPREAD THE

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:42.726 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OF CANNABIS

02:41:41.325 --> 02:41:43.827 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:45.129 region:rollup2
AND IF OUR COMMUNITIES CAN

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:46.430 region:rollup2
WEATHER THE TRANSITION.

02:41:45.129 --> 02:41:48.199 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:50.434 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS BLEAK.

02:41:48.199 --> 02:41:51.068 region:rollup2
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:53.637 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:54.271 region:rollup2
COMMENT TODAY.

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:56.674 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER O'NEILL MISTER

02:41:54.271 --> 02:41:58.175 region:rollup2
MOORE SAID.

02:41:56.674 --> 02:42:00.511 region:rollup2
MY NAME'S KENNY MORRISON.

02:41:58.175 --> 02:42:01.912 region:rollup2
AMER MANUFACTURER AND

02:42:00.511 --> 02:42:03.347 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTOR ARE BROKEN DOWN MY

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:04.915 region:rollup2
COMMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES

02:42:03.347 --> 02:42:07.685 region:rollup2
ON LICENSE RETAIL ACTIVITY

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:09.787 region:rollup2
TESTING AND EXCISE TAXES.

02:42:07.685 --> 02:42:11.755 region:rollup2
AS A BOARD MEMBER OF BOTH THE

02:42:09.787 --> 02:42:13.524 region:rollup2
CIA AND CCMA. DURING INTERNAL

02:42:11.755 --> 02:42:15.125 region:rollup2
DEBATES.

02:42:13.524 --> 02:42:16.126 region:rollup2
I HEAR THE INDUSTRY VACILLATE

02:42:15.125 --> 02:42:17.995 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SUPPORTING GREATER

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:19.930 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ON UNLICENSED RETAIL

02:42:17.995 --> 02:42:22.199 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY AND REQUESTING THE

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:23.867 region:rollup2
RAPID GRANTING OF MORE RETAIL

02:42:22.199 --> 02:42:26.070 region:rollup2
LICENSES.

02:42:23.867 --> 02:42:27.738 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE. IS SINCE MOST

02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:28.706 region:rollup2
LOCALITIES HAVE MOVED TOO SLOW

02:42:27.738 --> 02:42:30.240 region:rollup2
IN GETTING THEIR CANNABIS

02:42:28.706 --> 02:42:32.076 region:rollup2
PROGRAM GOING.

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:33.944 region:rollup2
IT'S MAKING LEGALISATION LOOK A

02:42:32.076 --> 02:42:36.146 region:rollup2
LOT LIKE PROHIBITION.

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:37.948 region:rollup2
A STATE EXCISE TAX REDUCTION

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:39.450 region:rollup2
ALLOWS ROOM FOR MUNICIPALITIES

02:42:37.948 --> 02:42:40.985 region:rollup2
TO GET A MUCH NEEDED SECOND BITE

02:42:39.450 --> 02:42:41.986 region:rollup2
OF THE APPLE.

02:42:40.985 --> 02:42:43.887 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL

02:42:41.986 --> 02:42:45.422 region:rollup2
LICENSURE.

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:47.057 region:rollup2
SECONDLY IT'S NAIVE TO THINK

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:48.726 region:rollup2
THAT THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:50.661 region:rollup2
ARE ADAMANT ABOUT SHOPPING AT A

02:42:48.726 --> 02:42:52.296 region:rollup2
LICENSED RETAILER. FOR THE

02:42:50.661 --> 02:42:53.731 region:rollup2
MAJORITY IT RARELY CROSSES THEIR

02:42:52.296 --> 02:42:55.132 region:rollup2
MINDS

02:42:53.731 --> 02:42:57.267 region:rollup2
WHAT MATTERS TO THE MAJORITY OF

02:42:55.132 --> 02:42:59.470 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS IS ACCESS IN THE FORM

02:42:57.267 --> 02:43:01.872 region:rollup2
OF AFFORDABILITY. A TEN DOLLAR

02:42:59.470 --> 02:43:03.774 region:rollup2
UNLICENSED PURCHASE IS FAR MORE

02:43:01.872 --> 02:43:05.643 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE THAN A THIRTY DOLLAR

02:43:03.774 --> 02:43:08.245 region:rollup2
LICENSED PURCHASE FOR THE SAME

02:43:05.643 --> 02:43:10.547 region:rollup2
ITEM. UNLICENSED RETAILERS ARE

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:12.916 region:rollup2
CAPTURING CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN

02:43:10.547 --> 02:43:14.418 region:rollup2
LICENSED ONCE.

02:43:12.916 --> 02:43:16.654 region:rollup2
I'VE OPERATED STATE LICENSED

02:43:14.418 --> 02:43:17.554 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES CANNABIS BUSINESSES

02:43:16.654 --> 02:43:19.056 region:rollup2
IN BOTH CALIFORNIA AND

02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:20.424 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON.

02:43:19.056 --> 02:43:22.159 region:rollup2
AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THE

02:43:20.424 --> 02:43:24.595 region:rollup2
MAJOR DIFFERENCE SO FAR. IN

02:43:22.159 --> 02:43:26.697 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON VERY QUICKLY FOR THE

02:43:24.595 --> 02:43:28.299 region:rollup2
CONSUMER REGULATED CANNABIS WAS

02:43:26.697 --> 02:43:30.067 region:rollup2
FAR CHEAPER THAN UNREGULATED

02:43:28.299 --> 02:43:31.402 region:rollup2
CANNABIS.

02:43:30.067 --> 02:43:33.170 region:rollup2
THE REASON WASHINGTON'S

02:43:31.402 --> 02:43:34.872 region:rollup2
REGULATED MARKET FLOURISHED IS

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:37.708 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY

02:43:34.872 --> 02:43:40.277 region:rollup2
UNDERCUT THE UNREGULATED MEDICAL

02:43:37.708 --> 02:43:42.813 region:rollup2
STORES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:43:40.277 --> 02:43:44.148 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM.

02:43:42.813 --> 02:43:46.116 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH CALIFORNIA'S

02:43:44.148 --> 02:43:47.318 region:rollup2
REGULATED ECOSYSTEM IS THAT IT

02:43:46.116 --> 02:43:48.752 region:rollup2
ONLY MONITORS THOSE WITHIN THE

02:43:47.318 --> 02:43:49.620 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:43:48.752 --> 02:43:51.288 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST THREATS TO

02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:52.956 region:rollup2
LEGALIZATION CURRENTLY RESIDE

02:43:51.288 --> 02:43:54.658 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF IT.

02:43:52.956 --> 02:43:56.093 region:rollup2
IN THE IMMEDIATE AND NEAR TERM

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:57.728 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL EFFORTS TO

02:43:56.093 --> 02:44:00.197 region:rollup2
REGULATE CANNABIS SHOULD FOCUS

02:43:57.728 --> 02:44:02.599 region:rollup2
ON THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION

02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:03.667 region:rollup2
OF JOINING THE REGULATED SPHERE.

02:44:02.599 --> 02:44:05.903 region:rollup2
IF WE FEEL IT'S A MATTER OF

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:08.005 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ENFORCEMENT IS

02:44:05.903 --> 02:44:10.274 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE JUST LOOK AT THE COST

02:44:08.005 --> 02:44:12.209 region:rollup2
OF NOT ENFORCING TAX REVENUE IS

02:44:10.274 --> 02:44:14.611 region:rollup2
BEING SIPHONED FROM THE STATE BY

02:44:12.209 --> 02:44:16.880 region:rollup2
UNLICENSED RETAILERS OUT IN AN

02:44:14.611 --> 02:44:18.882 region:rollup2
ARMY AT AN ALARMING RATE.

02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:20.117 region:rollup2
EXCISE TAX

02:44:18.882 --> 02:44:21.752 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SERIOUS CRISIS ON OUR

02:44:20.117 --> 02:44:23.320 region:rollup2
HANDS WITH REGARDS

02:44:21.752 --> 02:44:24.822 region:rollup2
TO EXCISE TAX ITS COLLECTION

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:26.156 region:rollup2
IT'S REMITTANCE.

02:44:24.822 --> 02:44:27.891 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IS BEGGING TO BE

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:29.693 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED FOR STARTERS

02:44:27.891 --> 02:44:31.462 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON AND OTHER STATES

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:33.964 region:rollup2
ALREADY TRIED MULTIPLE POINTS OF

02:44:31.462 --> 02:44:35.833 region:rollup2
TAXATION ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:37.801 region:rollup2
IT QUICKLY ALL GOT PUSHED TO A

02:44:35.833 --> 02:44:40.270 region:rollup2
RETAIL TAX THAT RETAILERS

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:41.772 region:rollup2
COLLECT AND REMIT THEMSELVES.

02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:43.507 region:rollup2
IF A RETAILER CAN COLLECT AND

02:44:41.772 --> 02:44:45.275 region:rollup2
REMIT SALES TAX WITHHOLDING

02:44:43.507 --> 02:44:46.910 region:rollup2
REMAIN PAYROLL TAX

02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:48.445 region:rollup2
EXCISE TAXES SHOULD FOLLOW THE

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:51.248 region:rollup2
SAME MODEL.

02:44:48.445 --> 02:44:53.016 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD BCC HAS NO AUTHORITY

02:44:51.248 --> 02:44:54.551 region:rollup2
OVER UNLICENSED LOCATIONS.

02:44:53.016 --> 02:44:55.719 region:rollup2
IF TAXES WERE COLLECTED AND

02:44:54.551 --> 02:44:56.754 region:rollup2
REMITTED FROM RETAIL THAN

02:44:55.719 --> 02:45:00.023 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY COULD

02:44:56.754 --> 02:45:02.426 region:rollup2
TRANSFER TO THE CD TFA.

02:45:00.023 --> 02:45:03.761 region:rollup2
LET'S GET THAT MONEY CALIFORNIA.

02:45:02.426 --> 02:45:04.228 region:rollup2
TESTING AND TAX REMITTANCE ARE

02:45:03.761 --> 02:45:05.963 region:rollup2
BOTH AREAS THAT CAN BE

02:45:04.228 --> 02:45:08.198 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY.

02:45:05.963 --> 02:45:09.233 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED.

02:45:08.198 --> 02:45:10.801 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THE INDUSTRY

02:45:09.233 --> 02:45:12.636 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS AND ADMITS WE HAVE

02:45:10.801 --> 02:45:14.138 region:rollup2
OVER REGULATION DUE TO A PUBLIC

02:45:12.636 --> 02:45:15.706 region:rollup2
IMAGE PROBLEM.

02:45:14.138 --> 02:45:17.841 region:rollup2
THE STATE NEEDS TO REMEMBER THE

02:45:15.706 --> 02:45:19.977 region:rollup2
IMAGE PROBLEM EXISTS DOES DO TO

02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:21.845 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH NO INTENTION OF EVER

02:45:19.977 --> 02:45:22.846 region:rollup2
PLAYING BY THE RULES. NOT THE

02:45:21.845 --> 02:45:24.615 region:rollup2
GOOD GUYS WILLING TO SET THE

02:45:22.846 --> 02:45:27.284 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:45:24.615 --> 02:45:29.019 region:rollup2
BOTH C. CIA AND CCMA SUPPORT

02:45:27.284 --> 02:45:31.522 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT PUBLIC

02:45:29.019 --> 02:45:33.924 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE BY THE STATE OF

02:45:31.522 --> 02:45:35.926 region:rollup2
CANNABIS BUSINESS LOCATIONS.

02:45:33.924 --> 02:45:37.761 region:rollup2
UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED

02:45:35.926 --> 02:45:39.897 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS

02:45:37.761 --> 02:45:41.498 region:rollup2
THE DISTRIBUTOR MYSELF I JUST

02:45:39.897 --> 02:45:43.667 region:rollup2
CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW MUCH

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:45.803 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THERE IS IN STORING

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:47.538 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY. ESPECIALLY

02:45:45.803 --> 02:45:48.772 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE AREAS CANNABIS

02:45:47.538 --> 02:45:50.407 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE REGULATE

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:52.376 region:rollup2
RELEGATED TO.

02:45:50.407 --> 02:45:53.777 region:rollup2
ASKING A HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED

02:45:52.376 --> 02:45:56.313 region:rollup2
EIGHTY OR SO DISTRIBUTORS IN THE

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:58.849 region:rollup2
STATE TO STORE ALL THAT CASH AND

02:45:56.313 --> 02:46:00.517 region:rollup2
ONLY REMIT ONCE PER QUARTER IS A

02:45:58.849 --> 02:46:02.719 region:rollup2
RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:04.655 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH OUR ADDRESSES

02:46:02.719 --> 02:46:07.791 region:rollup2
SEARCHABLE ONLINE.

02:46:04.655 --> 02:46:09.993 region:rollup2
BANKS HOLD LESS CASH THAN WE DO.

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:11.495 region:rollup2
TESTING.

02:46:09.993 --> 02:46:13.063 region:rollup2
AS THE CANNABIS MANUFACTURE FOR

02:46:11.495 --> 02:46:14.998 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS I'VE ALWAYS TESTED

02:46:13.063 --> 02:46:17.034 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE BATCH OF MY PRODUCT

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:19.870 region:rollup2
AND TESTING COSTS ARE STILL TEN

02:46:17.034 --> 02:46:21.605 region:rollup2
AXING THIS YEAR. WE CAN'T LET

02:46:19.870 --> 02:46:23.574 region:rollup2
STRICT TESTING PROTOCOLS AND

02:46:21.605 --> 02:46:26.076 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO TESTING

02:46:23.574 --> 02:46:28.412 region:rollup2
SERVICES STIFLE THE INDUSTRY.

02:46:26.076 --> 02:46:29.513 region:rollup2
COME THIS JULY WE NEED TO LEARN

02:46:28.412 --> 02:46:32.883 region:rollup2
FROM ORGAN AND AVOID

02:46:29.513 --> 02:46:34.852 region:rollup2
DEVASTATINGLY LONG LEAD TIMES.

02:46:32.883 --> 02:46:37.020 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THE MUST

02:46:34.852 --> 02:46:38.989 region:rollup2
BE TESTED IN FINAL FORM LANGUAGE

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:40.991 region:rollup2
IN STATUTE MEANS THAT MULTIPLE

02:46:38.989 --> 02:46:41.892 region:rollup2
PRODUCT CODES CAN USE A SINGLE

02:46:40.991 --> 02:46:43.861 region:rollup2
TEST RESULT TO MINIMIZE

02:46:41.892 --> 02:46:45.195 region:rollup2
REDUNDANT TESTS.

02:46:43.861 --> 02:46:47.097 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE OF A COUPLE

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:48.799 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES IF I MAKE A SMALL

02:46:47.097 --> 02:46:50.133 region:rollup2
MEDIUM AND LARGE BAG OF

02:46:48.799 --> 02:46:51.702 region:rollup2
CHOCOLATE THAT ALL COME FROM THE

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:52.936 region:rollup2
SAME BATCH OF CHOCOLATE DO I

02:46:51.702 --> 02:46:54.137 region:rollup2
NEED TO TEST ALL THREE PRODUCT

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:55.672 region:rollup2
CODES.

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:57.274 region:rollup2
IF I FEEL HALF GRAM VEIT

02:46:55.672 --> 02:46:59.943 region:rollup2
CARTRIDGE AND A ONE GRAM FAKE

02:46:57.274 --> 02:47:02.613 region:rollup2
CARTRIDGE WITH THE SAME OIL.

02:46:59.943 --> 02:47:04.982 region:rollup2
DO I NEED TO TEST BOTH SIZES.

02:47:02.613 --> 02:47:06.316 region:rollup2
ONE MORE EXAMPLE. IF I USE THREE

02:47:04.982 --> 02:47:07.618 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THREE

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:09.386 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TERRITORIES OF THE

02:47:07.618 --> 02:47:10.420 region:rollup2
STATE TO TEST PRODUCTS THAT ALL

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:11.822 region:rollup2
CAME FROM THE STAIN THE SAME

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:12.823 region:rollup2
BATCH.

02:47:11.822 --> 02:47:15.525 region:rollup2
DO I NEED TO TEST THAT SAME

02:47:12.823 --> 02:47:16.660 region:rollup2
BATCH THREE TIMES.

02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:19.062 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN AS A

02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:20.731 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER. IS THAT A TEN

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:22.1000 region:rollup2
PERCENT PLUS OR MINUS POTENCY

02:47:20.731 --> 02:47:24.167 region:rollup2
VARIANTS ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES

02:47:22.1000 --> 02:47:25.936 region:rollup2
THE MANUFACTURE OF MICRO DOES

02:47:24.167 --> 02:47:28.105 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

02:47:25.936 --> 02:47:30.073 region:rollup2
WHICH ITEMS BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE

02:47:28.105 --> 02:47:31.375 region:rollup2
MILLIGRAMS AND UNDER.

02:47:30.073 --> 02:47:32.676 region:rollup2
WE NEED A SLIDING SCALE FOR

02:47:31.375 --> 02:47:34.411 region:rollup2
VARIANCES WHICH MAKES

02:47:32.676 --> 02:47:36.380 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE MICRODISK PRODUCTS

02:47:34.411 --> 02:47:37.981 region:rollup2
ACHIEVABLE.

02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:40.183 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE IF I MAKE A TWO

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:41.318 region:rollup2
MILLIGRAM PRODUCT THERE'S NO LAB

02:47:40.183 --> 02:47:43.253 region:rollup2
THAT WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE A

02:47:41.318 --> 02:47:46.623 region:rollup2
TESTING TO A VARIANCE WITHIN

02:47:43.253 --> 02:47:47.958 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO TENTHS. OF A MILLIGRAM.

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:49.426 region:rollup2
ALL THESE ISSUES ABOVE HER MADE

02:47:47.958 --> 02:47:50.961 region:rollup2
EVEN WORSE WITHOUT CROSS LAB

02:47:49.426 --> 02:47:52.062 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZATION.

02:47:50.961 --> 02:47:53.564 region:rollup2
WE NEED CROSS LAB

02:47:52.062 --> 02:47:56.133 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZATION WHEN IT COMES TO

02:47:53.564 --> 02:47:58.135 region:rollup2
TESTING PROTOCOLS SO'S CONSUMERS

02:47:56.133 --> 02:47:59.770 region:rollup2
AND MANUFACTURERS CAN TRUST

02:47:58.135 --> 02:48:02.439 region:rollup2
TRUST THE RESULTS THEY GET WHEN

02:47:59.770 --> 02:48:05.208 region:rollup2
SWITCHING FROM LAB TO LAB.

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:06.810 region:rollup2

REGULATED MARKETPLACE THE

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:09.973 region:rollup2
COOPERATIVE PROJECTS MIGHT

HEARD FROM THE LEAGUE ABOUT THAT

02:49:29.493 --> 02:49:32.195 region:rollup2
MAYBE FIVE PERCENT IS THE RIGHT

02:49:31.328 --> 02:49:33.964 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

WHAT THAT WHAT THAT NUMBER

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.271 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:42.539 region:rollup2
FROM THE FARM PERSPECTIVE.

02:49:41.271 --> 02:49:44.875 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LOWER IS GOING TO HELL
