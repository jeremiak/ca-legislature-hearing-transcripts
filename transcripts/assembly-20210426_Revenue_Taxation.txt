OTHER THINGS THE CARE ACT PROVIDED FORGIVABLE LOANS TO THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM IN ADVANCE GRANTS UNDER THE ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOAN PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PROVIDED INVALUABLE INFUSION OF MONEY TO STRUGGLING BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FEDERAL. PROGRAM WE PASSED AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY INCOME TAX UNFORGIVEN PPP LOANS. IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY PASSED THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT TO WRITE AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF FUNDING TO SMALL BUSINESS. AB EIGHTY BUILT UPON LAST YEAR AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BY GIVING STRUGGLING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS EVEN MORE RELIEF. AB AT ENSURES EVERY TAXPAYER DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON ANY FORGIVEN PPP LOAN IT ALSO ALLOWS TAXPAYERS THAT SUFFERED AT LEAST A 25% REDUCTION IN REVENUE. TO DEDUCT ALL EXPENSES PAID FOR WITH FOR GIVEN PPP LOANS AND LESS THEY ARE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. AB AT ALSO EXCLUDES FROM GROSS INCOME FEDERAL ADVANCE. GRANTS PROVIDED UNDER THE E. I D. L. PROGRAM AND ALLOWS ALL TAXPAYERS TO FULLY DEDUCT EXPENSES PAID FOR WITH THESE GRANTS E. I D. L. GRANTS ARE TARGETED TO SMALL BUSINESSES LOCATED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED A LARGE DROP. IN SALES. AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE LEADERS DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO HELP AB EIGHTY PROVIDES CRITICAL TIMELY AND SIGNIFICANT TAX RELIEF TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT.

I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN THE- THERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION VIA REMOTE VIDEO. STATION AT THIS TIME. AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WASHINGTON SUSPEND OPPOSITION EITHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER COURT- SO MY WITH THE THIS ARE WOULD HAVE FULL FEDERAL CONFORMITY HOWEVER THE DATE IS LATE AND I KNOW THE CHAIR WANTED THAT. HOWEVER WE ALSO WANT TO BILL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE VETOED AND- SO IT'S NOT IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. MISTER BASS YEAH FIGHT CAN JUST ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- AND I LIKE MY COLLEAGUES JUST SPOKE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE TIME IS LATE- AND- THIS NEEDED TO BEEN DONE- NOT WEEKS AGO BUT MONTHS AGO- I ACTUALLY DID PREPARE TAXES FOR A LONG TIME. I UNDERSTAND- THE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS I NOT ONLY- IS IT- FOR ACCOUNTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INFORMATION BUT IS ALSO SOFTWARE- THAT HAS TO BE DONE TO ALLOW FOR- IT COUNTS- TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND BE ABLE TO DO. TO DO THE WORK AND I LIKE MY COLLEAGUE HAD WISHED THAT THIS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN- BEEN FULL CONFORMITY- THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL FULL FULL CONFORMITY- AND THE REASON- THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL CONFORMITY IS THIS THE BILL AS IT'S- AS IT'S CRAFTED. I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME I DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH I CALIFORNIA HAS DECIDED TO TAX FEDERAL GRANTS- I DON'T KNOW OF IF THAT'S EVER HAPPENED BEFORE- WHAT IS BEFORE US SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS AND YOU RECEIVE THE PPP LOAN. AND THAT LOAN WAS FORGIVEN THAT UNLESS YOU HAD A 25% A RENDON MAKE SURE THAT I'M WRONG I'M HERE I WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR CLARIFYING THAT UNLESS YOU HAD A 25% REDUCTION. IN YOUR HEY OVER OR YOU PAY YOUR GROSS RECEIPTS OVER TWENTY TWENTY NINETEEN THEN YOU ARE GOING TO PAY TAXES FULL STATE TAXES IN CALIFORNIA ON THAT NOTE ON THAT FORGIVENESS OF THE PPP LOAN IF YOU HAD MADE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GROSS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND YOU HAD MADE. A SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND A GROSS RECEIPTS IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU ARE GOING TO PAY TAXES- ON- THAT UP ON THAT INCOME AND I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FIRST. A IN CALIFORNIA THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL CAN- THE MAIN THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE AND- INSIDE A NEW CARL CARDIO. SO LETTER IT SAYS- IN REGARDS TO A 25% REDUCTION OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD OF TIME OVER A QUARTER WHICH IS THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND PPP ALONE- IS IT THERE ARE 25% REDUCTION PER QUARTER OR JUST RECEIPTS. YOUR OVER YOUR FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. ALL RIGHT SO MANY. NO NO I HAVE I'VE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO I TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE ALL FIRST DIDN'T FOR THE CLARIFICATION PURPOSES WE DIDN'T DISPLAY WE HAD A AB EIGHTY THE SENATE SIDE WE IT BECAUSE WE GOT. BECAUSE THE BILL BILL MUCH AND WE GOT THE SENSE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET CLOSER TO FULL CONFORMITY WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL GOAL- WE PULLED THE BILL WHEN WE GOT. THIS THAT WE COULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WE DIDN'T START LATE WE STARTED. WHEN OTHER STATES BEGAN BUT WE- WE WANTED TO GET AS CLOSE TO FULL CONFORMITY AS WE COULD GET FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING. THE SECOND PART IS YES WE DID ONE FULL CONFORMITY THE REGIONAL BILL IS TWO BILLION WE HAVE NOT XBEE HAVE NOW EXPANDED UP TO SIX BILLION WHICH WILL ACTUALLY INCLUDE CLUED PER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND 85% OF THOSE WHO GOT THE LOANS. SO AND THEN ON THE 25% GROUP. THE 25% THE WAY WE'VE CHOSE IT WAS BECAUSE THE SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING REQUIRED THAT 25% LOSS. SO THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO THAT NUMBER WAS THAT. INSTEAD OF DOING WE HAD MANY INTEGRATIONS COME TO US MANY SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. SELECTING INDUSTRIES NARROWING IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE MEMBERS BACK IN A SITUATION WERE PICKING. REALLY DEFINED WINNERS AND LOSERS WHERE WE WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS. OKAY FOR DOCTORS BUT NOT BE TITIAN'S OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE OUR GOLF COURSES WE WOULD GET IT AND- ATTORNEYS WANT WHATEVER IT WAS WE WANTED TO MAKE IT. AS CONSISTENT. AS WELL AS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LAW IS WE COULD AND- ON THE LAST POINT WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY TAXING THE GRANTS WE ARE DISALLOWING. THE DEDUCTION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TAXING GRANT SUGGESTS OKAY SO NOW YOUR NEXT QUESTION IS GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING TO RUN. NO I'VE AND THE REASON IT'S A IS THAT THE- WAS. IS A TWO FIVE PER READ. PER CORE. OR TWENTY FIVE PER RATE. YEAR OVER YEAR. I DON'T I'M NOT SURE FOR THE TWENTY PRIVATE ACTION A RECORDER YEAR YEAR BUT ANY KIND. WITH THE FEDERAL LAW WITH THE SECOND ROUND OF GRANTS IF I UNDERSTAND UP TO THE SECOND ROUND OF GRANTS THE SECOND THE PPP LOAN DOES NOT REGARD TO TAX CONFORMITY THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT APPLES APPLES AND ORANGES. I UNDERSTAND THE FORMULAS 25% RATE SO IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO GET THE SECOND PPP ALONE THEY WOULD HAD HAVE SHOWN A 25% REDUCTION RIGHT THAT'S IT SEPARATE- A SEPARATE FEDERAL LAW. IN A SEPARATE FEDERAL LAW THEN. THERE IS A ONE TIME EVENT NO I MEAN- O. J.'S ALL OF I'LL JAN IT BUT I GOING TO JERRY STILLER. YES I'M HERE YEAH- SO THE ANSWER OF IS YES. IS THAT. IT WOULD BE. 25% AND A- QUARTER. CHAU TOOK A PERCENT CAUGHT. IN ANY QUARTER TWENTY TWO FOUR FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. SO BUT STILL UNDER AS IT IS THIS IS NOT IN THE IN. AND I FIND IT IN THE WAY. OF THE HOW THAT BE HOW THAT BE SHOWN. ON THE RETURN WHEN YOU FILE YOUR TAX. YOU FILE A TAX RETURN FOR THE OF TWENTY TWO. YOU DON'T SHE ON YOUR TO RETURN- THAT- YOU KNOW QUARTER BY QUARTER. SO HOW WOULD THAT BE CHAU AND HOW YOU PROVE. I CAN'T HOW WE HELL THAT WOULD BE DONE- IT'S IT DID SAME. THING OF EVIDENCE SHE WOULD. FOR- FORGETTING THE SECOND RIGHT. MMHM SO AS- SO THAT TO BE WITH HAVE TO ANSWER EXACTLY HOW THEY MONTH. PUT ON TO THE TAX RETURNS I DOUBT DON'T TAXPAYERS THANK YOU GIVE YOU THE DETAILS OF HOWEVER. IF YOU QUALIFIED THIS I ROUND OF WHAT I. DOCUMENT TO YOU. TO QUALIFY FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF ONE. IS WHAT ARE INTO. IS FOR YOU TO CALL. FOR THIS FOR A I FIND AS A DOCTOR AND- THE AND THEN THIS IS A- BUT- I KNOW MADAM CHAIR THE THAT YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON NO I'M JUST TRYING. THINK THE THIS ONE SO NEW ONCE A YOU COULD ME THROUGH THE NEW. THE CONCERN YOU THE I COULD. BETTER HELP UNDERSTAND THEN THE NEW ON THE NEW WANTS IS- THAT THERE GOING TO BE. IN LOT OF BUSINESS AND CAL. THAT HAD GOT- THE LOAN FORGIVENESS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT TAX. TO THEM AND CAL. IS TO- THAT AND THE IT'S A- CLEAR QUESTION. IS IT IS THE ONLY RE 220% WERE. OVER A- OR THAT IT'S FIVE PER REDUCTION OVER THE ENTIRE THE END YEAR I THOUGHT HE SAID- OVER THE. RIGHT SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTION THEN IS. AND THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE THIS IS NOT THAT TECH. THE FOLLOW UP. IS HOW IS. DONE THROUGH THE FRENCH. TAX FORTY IT- IF IT'S ONLY. BY QUARTER. I HAVE. WAS HOW WAS THAT DONE BY. WHEN YOU YOUR WO RETURN. IT'S YOUR GROW RECEIPTS FOR THE ANTI YEAR IN NOT BROKE DOWN. BY QUARTER RIGHT AND FIRST LET'S GO BACK TO. WE ARE NOT TAXING ANYONE FLOWN YOU KEEP SAYING IT I KNOW YOU THINK YOU DON'T BUT YOU KEEP SAYING WE'RE TAXING ALONE WE ARE NOT. WE'RE ALLOWING THE DEDUCTION. IS A DIFFERENT I MEAN I KNOW YOU DO TAXES BUT I MEAN I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS COMMITTEE FROM HAVE BEEN DOING THIS BILL. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. SO THERE MAY BE A NEW ONCE MISS UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT THE ACTUAL BILL IS DOING. IT IS ALLOWING THE TAXPAYER TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THEY. QUALIFY FOR THE DEDUCTION. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS OFFLINE YOU CAN HOLD OFF YOUR BOAT THAT'S FINE. AND I CAN LOG WE CAN WALK YOU THROUGH IT. BUT WE ARE NOT TAXING A GRANT OR LOAN WHICH YOU SAID TWICE IT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE WE'RE ALLOWING THE DEDUCTION. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE LIKE WE- J. IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. THIS IS A TAX BENEFIT THAT WE ARE GIVING TO TAXPAYERS IN THE CONFORMITY AND SO INTENSE IT OFF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HARMING THE REGISTRY SO THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE CONFORMITY OR JUST GETTING TREATED THE WAY THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE TREATED UNDER UNDER TAX LAW. I THINK IF I CAN JUST ONE MORE ONE MORE QUESTION HOW MANY STATES- THAT HOW MANY STATES. ARE ALLOWING FULL CONFORMITY AND HOW MANY STATES ARE SAYING. THAT WERE USES 25% THRESHOLD. THE A HARD TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF US FELL INTO THIS PROBLEM WITH THE U. S. TREASURY RIGHT SO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS BILL. ALTHOUGH WE DID WE WERE NOT PROVIDING FULL CONFORMITY YOU WERE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE FULL CONFORMITY MOST STATES ARE A LOT OF STATES EXCEPT FOR A HANDFUL. HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR PERMISSION FROM THE U. S. TREASURY. TO ACTUALLY DO THE TO ACTUALLY PASS THESE BILLS WITHOUT LOSING OUR FEDERAL FUNDING. SO ANSWERING THAT QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA IT'LL- I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE ASKING AND IF I ANSWER IT HONESTLY I THINK OR IF WE ANSWERED HONESTLY I THINK YOU GET A SHORTCOMING ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BECAUSE ALL OF THE STATE'S WE WEREN'T ALONE IN BEING PUT ON HOLD. OTHER STATES ARIZONA OTHER STATES WERE PUT ON HOLD LIKE WE WERE. BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE PASSING OF THE KOPET ACT. THE CODE. OKAY SO WE DON'T I CAN'T GIVE YOU A PRECISE ANSWER BECAUSE SO MANY ARE IN PROCESS LIKE WE ARE LATE BECAUSE OF IT IN FACT FINALLY FIND IF I CAN. EXCELLENT IN THAT MADAM CHAIR I AM GONNA LAY OFF TODAY- THIS WAS A BILL THAT I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT SEEING- AND- AND I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. UP RIGHT AWAY- IF I CAN JUST MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENTARY I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE- THAT- AND I KNOW THAT- BUT THAT THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK I JUST WISH THAT THIS COMMITTEE. I'M HAD THE ABILITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS I WISH THAT- THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE. WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE NEGOTIATING POWER IT SOUNDS LIKE WE WANT A FULL CONFORMITY- AND YET WE DIDN'T GET A FULL CONFORMITY- AND MY GUESS IS. THAT WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD THE VOTES TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVERAGE TO GET FULL CONFORMITY SO- I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER BASS I AM. JUST JUST- I KNOW THERE'S A FEW MORE COMMITTEE MAY WHO WAS. BUT JUST TO ADD TO. J- MISTER. CHAMBERLAIN YOU MAY EARLIER- THAT THIS COULD BE 25% QUARTERLY OR TWICE FIRST ANNUALLY AND MY CALL WHAT HIS QUESTION HOW DO YOU DO TO. WHAT DOCUMENTS DO YOU GIVE BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT IS THAT WHEN WE DO OUR TAXES WE DO IT ANNUALLY WE DON'T DO BY QUARTER SHE SAID QUARTERLY OR ANNUALLY. HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT IF YOU'RE TAX IS DONE BY ANNUALLY. RIGHT SO YEAH THAT THERE IT WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD SHOW UP ON. THE- ON THE TAX RETURN- IT WOULD IT WOULD BE I. I DON'T HAVE TO BE A THE LINE THAT'S YOUR EXACT HOW IT. HOW CAUGHT UP HAVE BUT I IT WOULD BE A SOFTWARE. THAT THE- I THE TAXPAYER WOULD HAVE TO- DO WITH THE DO THE- I'M JUST LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WANT TO BE GET THE- THAT. LOAN SECOND ROUND LOS- BUT- I'M- BUT I BELIEVE THEY WOULD THEY WOULD TO STOP TEST TO MEDIAN THAT STAND AND THEN ABLE TO THAT UPON AUDIT- BUT I DO BELIEVE TO BE IS HERE WANTED TO THEM. GET THEIR- THEIR INSIGHT. IS THERE SOME. AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON YOUR QUESTION LOCAL COPS. GO AHEAD PLEASE FORM- I WOULD. THANK YOU I WOULD AGREE WITH CAME NOT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD REPORTED ON THE RICH AND THAT AMOUNT OF DETAIL IT WOULD SOMETHING THAT- PAUL BUSINESS ENTITY WHAT IF WILL CALL. AND THEN WOULD AFTER INPUT TO THAT- OF COURSE THAT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE OR NOT ONE THING THAT WE WILL VERY QUICKLY DO PROVIDE ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION SHOULD TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFO CALL A RETURN. THANK YOU. JUST REAL QUICK CAN I CAN I SOMEBODY PER ME THAT AND UNDERSTAND AND TRY TO GET THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR- QUICKLY IS THAT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET CLAY WITHIN BUT AT THE ACTUAL THAT THAT IT'S QUARTER% BY QUARTER VERSUS A YEAR OVER YEAR. YEAH I MEAN I'M JUST. NOT SOMEBODY LISTEN. ANSWERS THOUGH. MISTER WOULD BE ABLE OR FROM THE FTP ON GOING TO HOLD THE BILL THAT I'M I'M NOT A THEM YOU KNOW NO I'M I'M ANSWERING AND I USING THE PEOPLE NEED TO THIS DYING AND I'M THE F. BE WILL BE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU KNOW IF HAVE TO POOR IF THEY NEED TO AUDIT THE TO CONFIRM THAT THAT THAT THEY IN THAT TWENTY THAT. MAY THEY RECEIVE THE STUCK ROUND OF FUNNY THAT REQUIRE THE 25% THE REQUIRED PAPER. TO SHOW THAT 25% I AM NO DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE CAN MANAGE THAT. HOWEVER THESE BUT THIS BILL AS YOURSELF AND DOCTOR CREEK HAVE MENTIONED ARE LONG OVERDUE SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT THEM ON PAUSE FOR ANOTHER DAY PEOPLE NEED TO GET. THESE BUSINESSES NEED THESE BUSINESS NEEDS NEED TO GET THAT THIS THEIR TAXES DONE. THEY'VE SOME HAVE FILED EXTENSION SOME ARE TRYING TO WAIT. NOT JUST THE BUSINESSES BUT THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GETS DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. MISTER KELLY. THANK YOU SIR THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT WHO SORT THIS OUT AS THE PERSON DOING THE TAXES MY WIFE- THEY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER WITH THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BASED ON ALL OF THE DATA THAT THEY CAN COLLECT FROM THE BUSINESS OWNER THE RECORDS IT'S ADDRESS AND FIGURE OUT THAT OUT AND THIS WHOLE TAX CONFORMITY ISSUE IS ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ISSUES- REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF- OF CONFUSION- AND PAPERWORK. AND STREAMLINE IT SO THAT THESE TACTICS ACTUALLY GET DONE RIGHT NOW THERE IS A BACKLOG FOR EVERY TAX PROFESSIONAL OF ALL OF THESE CLIENTS THAT ARE WAITING FOR THIS THIS SAID THIS TO COME THROUGH AND- SO- YEAH ANOTHER COMMENT I HAVE IS YOU KNOW IT WHILE THE TAX DEDUCTION. IS NOT A TAX. IF YOU ARE NOT A TO IF YOU'RE DEDUCTING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD YOU GET A CREDIT OR DEBIT TAX DEDUCTION. AND THAT'S NOT ALLOWED THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PAY TAXES ON THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WINDS UP BEING LIKE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS INSTEAD IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AND- IT'S NOT IT BUT SO THERE IS. AN AMOUNT OF TAX THAT DOES HAPPEN- BUT- BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A LOT MORE BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELPED BY THIS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HEARD. AND IF WE IF WE HOLD THIS UP ORG. ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO- THEN THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ARE HURTING AND NEEDED HELP. NOW ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED- I FULLY. HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AS MR QUIRK MISTER MAYES- BUT WE NEED TO MOVETHIS THING FORWARD. TO HELP THESE BUSINESSES OUT NOW. AND TO GET THE TAX PROFESSIONALS WORKING OUT THERE- THE DEADLINE NOW IS MAY TWENTY ARE MAY SEVENTEENTH. AND THEY'RE ALL UNDER THE GUN THEY'RE ALL WAITING FOR THIS. SO WE NEED TO GET IT DONE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- AND I REALLY WANT TO. JUST ECHO MISTER SAY ARTISTS COMMENTS I THINK THAT A LOT OF US YOU KNOW WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE OR DIFFERENT THINGS IN THIS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS CERTAINTY THAT'S THE THING THAT'S BEEN HURTING MOST BUSINESSES THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO REPORT AND HOW TO PAY THEIR TAXES. SO THE ONLY THING THAT I'LL SAY DIFFERENT. YES THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR WHAT WHAT I THINK WAS TASK I YOU KNOW I HAVE HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY. EMAILS AND CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE SAID WHEN IS THIS THING GOING TO GET DONE WE JUST WANT TO DO OUR TAXES- NOT. I WANT TO GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING TAXES THEY JUST WANT TO DO THEIR TAXES THEY'RE GOOD AMERICANS THEY'RE GOOD CALIFORNIANS ANSWER THANKS THE AUTHOR- FOR SHEPHERDING US THROUGH. THANK. WELL AND I ALSO I ALSO DO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR- I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS I THINK IF OF MANY ON THIS COMMITTEE I AM THAT I WISH WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER FULL CONFORMITY I RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE THIS IS CERTAINLY A FAR BETTER THAN NOTHING AND BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS REALLY GOOD I DO WORRY ABOUT THOSE OTHER TWENTY PERCENT- SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ABLE IF YOU COULD HELP THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK OTHERS UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF. IT WHY ARE WE- GOING WITH THIS 25% GIVEN THAT YOU. AS THE AUTHOR WENT FULL CONFORMITY. MINIBUSES CO AUTHORS WANT FULL CONFORMITY. YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THE COST YOU KNOW I STARTED OUT WITH THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR BILL IT'S NOW A SIX BILLION DOLLAR BILL IN FULL CONFORMITY IS. A LITTLE OVER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IT'S REALLY A FUNCTION OF THIS ISN'T THE ONLY BILL THAT WE'VE DONE TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE STRESS IS A BUSINESS. I CALL AND EVERYONE LISTEN THERE'S NOT A PERSON ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT DOESN'T KNOW THAT. THAT I AM FULLY SUPPORT OF A SMALL BUSINESS AND BUSINESS IN GENERAL AND. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT THEY EMPLOY- THE REALITIES THAT SOME. YOU OUT OF MY- AND WE WERE PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO SIGNIFICANT COST AND WE HUNG OUT ALMOST EQUALLY CONFIDENT THAT SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SIGNIFICANT PACKAGE- AND THAT'S REALLY THAT LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT IS REALLY NOT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING IT'S BEEN THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE HAS BEEN AMAZING AND THEY PUSHED VERY VERY HARMFUL CONFORMITY WITH US AS WELL- YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST WE JUST CAN'T QUITE GET THERE AND FROM WHERE WE STARTED LIKE I SAID FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVE WHO HAVE LOOKED AT EIGHTY. FROM ITS ORIGINAL FORM. THIS IS. MUCH FURTHER THAN WE WERE. WE ARE SEVENTY SEVEN AUTHORS DEEP ON THIS BILL WE PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE. AS ANYONE COULD PUT. YOU KNOW ON THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN SEVENTY SEVEN MEMBERS A SEVENTY SEVEN MEMBERS AND SENATORS YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.-I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME I SAW A BILL WITH THAT MANY AUTHORS THAT. STUCK WITH IT NO MATTER WHAT THE ADORATION WAS. SO YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY. YES WOULD FULL CONFORMITY BEEN NICE DID I THINK I MIGHT MAKE IT THERE I DIDN'T FOR A BIT. BUT WE DID IT AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS AT THIS POINT. SIX SERVING 85% OF THOSE WHO HAVE HAVE STRUGGLED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND WHO DID THE RIGHT THING. WHO SPENT THE MONEY ON THE RIGHT THINGS IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF. AND I ALSO WILL TELL YOU THIS YOU KNOW THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE STRUCK WERE FOR COMPANIES YOU KNOW WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BALANCE THAT OUT. BUT I FEEL VERY PROUD THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT 85% OF THE BUSINESSES I THINK THOSE WHO. DON'T VOTE FOR IT. I HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE 85% OF THOSE BUSINESSES AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY KEPTON THEIR PAYROLL. WITH THIS MONEY. SO THAT'S MY ANSWER. THE SCENE NO MORE COMMENTS IF I MAY JUST SAY A FEW WORDS MADAM CHAIR- I YOUR SISTER CONCERNS WITH CALLING I WISH WAS FOR OF FOOD CONFORM. OF BUT- EITHER IT IS A I WAS JUST MADE OF THIS. FRIDAY OF BY ANOTHER COLLEAGUE- IN REGARDS TO THE 25% AND SO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY MAYBE LATER ON- THE VIEW WOULD CONSIDER WE LOOKING AT THE 25% OR IN AN OPTION OF OTHER WAYS TO HELP I THINK- THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOU IT IT IS A THANKLESS CHOPPING YOU WORKED REALLY HARD TO HIDE I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I WOULD GET TEXT MESSAGES AND CALLS FROM YOU SAY HEY WE'RE STILL WORKING. ON WHICH TO- I'M PULLING IT I. WORK ON ITS- NO GREATLY A- AND- YOU KNOW I WISH WE- HAD FULL. I'VE I GUESS SURE WHAT MY CALL. THIS IS THE RIGHT BILL THE NEED TO GO FORWARD. BECAUSE THERE ARE 85% OF THE OTHER BUSINESSES AS WELL- BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE I'M HOPEFUL THAT MAYBE THERE'S OTHER OPTIONS THAT WE CAN ASSIST IN OTHER WAYS- IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR SO A MONTH BEFORE THE END OF SESSION AS WELL SO. THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME- WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TOO MANY CLOSE UP THAT'S RIGHT CAN YOU PLEASE CLOSE YET FIRST OFF I WANT TO TELL YOU WHEN I WHEN I TOLD THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHICH IS THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST REVENUE TAX BILL THAT I HAVE SEEN SUCH PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT ATTENTION AND I AM JUST SO GRATEFUL TO THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL THE MEMBERS.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEPHANIE BENNETT I'M A WIFE AND A MOM OF TWO DAUGHTERS AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD AND A SEVEN YEAR OLD AND WE LIVE IN CENTRAL VALLEY. LAST SPRING AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF HARD WORK I FINALLY GRADUATED AND RECEIVED MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS IT TOOK TWELVE YEARS. UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME COULD HAVE HELPED ME AT THIS TIME AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU. JUST A SMALL PORTION OF HOW IT COULD HELP THAT. EVEN WITH MY HUSBAND WORKING A FULL TIME JOB IN THE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID WE COULDN'T AFFORD GAS OR CHILD CARE. THE WAIT LIST FOR CHILD CARE WAS TOO LONG SO I WOULD NEVER GUARANTEED A SPOT FOR MY CHILD AT SCHOOL AND WITHOUT CHILD CARE I COULDN'T WORK WITH WHILE I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. I ATTENDED TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT I CAN STAY ONLINE CLASSES AROUND MY HUSBAND'S WORK SCHEDULE WHICH MEANT I NEEDED TO FILL UP MY GAS TANK MORE OFTEN. GOING TO SCHOOL DIDN'T JUST MEAN ATTENDING CLASSES IT MEANT FORCING MY FAMILY TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. THIS CONSTANT FINANCIAL STRUGGLE MADE ME. STOP AND RESTART MY EDUCATION SEVERAL TIMES. A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME COULD HELP ALLEVIATE THIS PART OF MY PROBLEM THE SCHOOL. DEMANDED THAT I COULD HAVE AFFORDED TO FILL MY GAS TANK UP PAPER CHILD CARE OR HELP ME PROVIDE. AND FINE CLOTHES BUY CLOTHES THAT FIT MY GROWING TODDLERS. FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE A UPI COULD MEAN WE GET TO FINISH HER EDUCATION IN A TIMELY MANNER WHILE HAVING THE ROOM TO BREATHE WHILE PROVIDING PART FAMILIES. I WANT TO SHOW MY DAUGHTER THAT A HIGHER EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL AND IT'S POSSIBLE. I DID NOT WANT THEM TO SEE IT AS A BURDEN OR A LONG HAUL AS IT WAS FOR MYSELF.

ABOUT SOME JOBS HAVE BEEN MADE OBSOLETE BY TECHNOLOGY OTHERS TAKE THEIR PLACE THE FEAR DOESN'T SQUARE WITH REALITY FURTHER PROGRAMS ALREADY EXIST TO RETRAIN OUR WORKERS AS WELL AS BILLION SPENT ON EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE HOMELESS SERVICES ND OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT BENEFIT PROGRAMS IF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE NOT LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS WE MUST ENSURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WORK BETTER BEFORE LITERALLY THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM.

THANK YOU. ARE YOU TESTING. GOOD I'M FIGHTING AGAINST THIS BUT I'D LIKE TO BE A PRIMARY WITNESS SINCE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WITHOUT A PROBLEM I AM A CALIFORNIAN AFTER ALL YOU'RE SO YOU NEED TO REGISTER BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL.

NO SEEING NONE- ANY NO ONE IN THE HEARING ROOM IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AS WELL ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE WILL GO. MOVE THE BILLS OUT A SECOND OKAY I'LL GO THIS WAY. NO NO YEAH I KNOW YOU HAVE A QUESTION- SO KILEY I THINK HER HAND UP AND THEN MISTER SEA ARTURO. AND THEN ADAM WILL GO AROUND THE BACK. CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL. THE QUESTIONS I HEARD AT THE SPECIFICS OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL. YES HAVE AS YOU MAY KNOW THEY A PROPOSAL IS ON UNIVERSAL UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME AS WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR ITERATIONS OF A STIMULUS. CASH PAYMENTS GOING DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUALS ON THIS WOULD BE A SIMILAR TYPE OF INTEGRATION OF THE THOUSAND DOLLAR BENEFITS AS- REFLECT IN THE COMING NOW SAYS THEIR NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ESPECIALLY AS I'VE INTRODUCED THIS ACTUALLY FOR THE SECOND YEAR HAVE REQUESTED A SELECT COMMITTEE ON THIS TO HELP FOR THE IRON OUT SOME OF THE POLICY ISSUES. OF THIS COMMITTEE- STRIPPED OUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM TOWARDS IT- AND SO THIS PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICY ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION. WE GIVEN THAT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITHIN RECEIVE SUCH BASIC INCOME PAYMENTS- SO THAT IS THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US WHICH IS THAT OF. AND GIVING THAT AUTHORITY TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE THESE CASH PAYMENTS WORKING THAT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TO BEST DETERMINE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AS REFLECT IN THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT OF THIS THIS CONFLICT WITH OTHER TYPE OF SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND HAVE ANOTHER SIMILAR- SISTER BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT COMPETE THAT STACKED WITH. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS WE DON'T WANT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES INDIVIDUALS NOT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS TO ALSO RECEIVE THESE PAYMENTS AS WELL TOO SO. AS WE HAVE THE BILL BEFORE US THAT'S TO GIVE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THAT AUTHORITY. AND SO THE PROPOSAL. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT WOULD BE A THOUSAND DOLLAR MONTH PAYMENT FOR ANY CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WITH SOME EXCLUSIONS BURNING MORE. THAT 2100% OR LESS OF THE MEDIAN RENTS FOR THE DISTRICTS SO- YOU MENTION THERE ISN'T A FUNDING MECHANISM AND IT IS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE OF. THE. ANNUAL COST OF A PROGRAM OF THAT. YOU SIGNIFICANT- AND THAT THAT IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE THAT I HAVE BEFORE US WHICH IS TO HAVE A POLICY CONVERSATION TO SEE WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THE COST WOULD BE THE DETERMINANT BUT HAN WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT TYPE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WHAT TYPE OF CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY IN EXISTING PROGRAMS ALREADY HOW DOES THIS WORK IN IN COMPLEMENTARY WAS IT STACKED. ALSO IDENTIFYING WHAT OTHER LOCAL CITIES ARE DOING AND HOW THAT IS IN COMPLEMENT TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING AS WELL. SO IF MY MATH IS RIGHT AND IT MIGHT BE WRONG BUT IF MY MATH IS RIGHT I THINK THIS IS LIKE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS. THE CLEARLY WOULD BE A DOUBLING OF OUR STATE'S BUDGET IS THAT KIND OF BALLPARK WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS IT IS A LARGE AMOUNT YES AND IT IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. YES AND THAT'S WHY I THINK- THAT I APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIRS AND I'M TOTALLY STRIPPED. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY HAVE THE FIRST HEARING US I'VE PROPOSED THIS YES THIS IS A VERY POLL PROPOSAL- AND BECAUSE- THE- COMMITTEE CHAIR ALLOWED FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THE FIRST TIME. EVER TO BE. A HURT- THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO SEE WHAT WITH THE POLICY LOOK LIKE. ABSENT THAT OF THE FUNDING MECHANISM. OKAY UNDERSTOOD. OKAY AND AS I SAID LOOK I CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY- BUT THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. OKAY OKAY- SO EVERY RESIDENT DO WE HAVE A RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU GET IT WHAT IS THAT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS I WAS THE WERE IRONED OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES BUT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. RIGHT OKAY SO DOES OREGON WASHINGTON NEVADA ARIZONA ALL THESE OTHER STATES DO THEY HAVE THIS. DO THEY HAVE THE REVERSE BASIC INCOME YEAH NO AS I MENTIONED IN THE- PRESENTATION THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BRADY SO AND WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER PILOTS. IN MANY CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M GETTING AT HERE IS. E. ADD UP THE NUMBER OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GRADUATES FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT STATES I DON'T HAVE IT. IN CALIFORNIA IS OFFERING YOU TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO COME HANG OUT HERE WE DON'T HAVE JOBS FOR THEM WE DON'T HAVE HOUSES FOR THEM. THAT'S PART OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ABOUT THIS- IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE LOWERING FROM OTHER STATES THAT NOW BECOME CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH JOBS FOR THE ONES THAT WE HAVE HERE NOW. WE DON'T HAVE HOUSES WERE THE-ONES WE HAVE HERE NOW. SO THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO GET TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS TO. EXPAND THE ECONOMY THAT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE GIVEN OUR CIRCUMVENT RESEARCH- I CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND- YEAH IT FRANKLY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- YOU KNOW GIVING GIVING TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO WITH WHAT THEY WANT- IS KIND OF A RECIPE FOR SOCIAL DISASTER. AND SO I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS ESPECIALLY IN ITS CURRENT FORM I WOULD BE I WOULD BE OPEN TO LISTENING TO SOMETHING ABOUT REPLACING SOME OF OUR CURRENT- THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS MARY OUT OF ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. BUT THE PRICE TAG IS TOO BIG TO LURE IS TOO BIG AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA CAN'T HANDLE ESPECIALLY GIVEN OUR- OUR A PENCHANT FOR. HAVING YOU KNOW A FAIRLY BUSINESS AND FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT AT THIS TIME SO. I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU. ADAM. MISTER GREG. I DON'T MORE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WON'T REPEAT THE COMMENTS- THE MYCOLOGIST LAID OUT AS FAR AS KIND OF THE- WHAT WHAT AT FIRST BLUSH I THINK DISTRICTS ALL OF US IS ALMOST SORT RIGHT THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO. DO A PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THIS LEGISLATURE- AND THESE COMMENTS ARE DIRECTED AT THE AUTHOR OF A DESTRUCTIVE BOND. IS WE LOVE TO- MAKE LOFTY PROMISES TO OUR POLITICAL BASE PARTICULARLY MY COLLEAGUES THAT- MY PARTY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WE LOVE TO SUGGEST THINGS THAT THAT ARE TOTALLY NOT REALISTIC. RIGHT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. SINGLE PAYER HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S EXAMPLE RIGHT JUST OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE TAX SYSTEM WOULDN'T EVEN SUPPORT. NOT THAT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. RIGHT AT ITS CORE MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS HEALTH CARE. BOB IT'S SO. GIVEN THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T HAVE FUNDING IN IT STRIP BY THIS COMMITTEE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT YEAH- I WANT I WANT TO TALK FOR MEN ABOUT I THINK WHAT YOUR CORE. VALUES RIGHT I THINK WHAT YOUR CORE VLUES YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE AFFORDABLE RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE HOW UNAFFORDABLE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BECOME THE COST OF HOUSING THE COST OF LIVING IN CENTER. AND THAT'S AND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WON'T WORK WHERE I THINK WE'D FIND A LOT OF- COMMON GROUND EVEN EVEN WITH OUR FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE RIGHT HOW DO WE MAKE. THE ECONOMY CALIFORNIA WORK BETTER ONE OF MY COMPLAINTS IS A RURAL. CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE SPEND 90% OF OUR TIME HERE IN SACRAMENTO SOLVING URBAN PROBLEMS. RIGHT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS URBAN COMMUNITIES- DON'T BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING TO SUPPORT. THEIR COMMUNITIES THEIR WORK FORCE AND SUCH GREAT CREATE A SUPPLY DEMAND ISSUE DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING. AND THE ANSWER TO THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS IS ALWAYS YOU KNOW SUBSIDIES OR GOVERNMENT MONEY AND THINGS THAT THAT THAT FUNCTIONALLY. LONG TERM DON'T WORK. I'VE OFTEN I THOUGHT WE SHOULD RELITIGATE THE WAGE MAKE MINIMUM WAGE HAVE THE SAME BUYING POWER IN EVERY COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE ALWAYS DO IS WE SELL WE PICK A NUMBER THAT WE THINK SOUNDS GOOD THE PEOPLE LIKE CAN WE GO WHAT THE FIGHT FOR TWELVE THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN THE FIGHT FOR TWENTY EIGHT. BUT WE NEVER HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS BUY. IN PALO ALTO. PURSES OUT WATER. OR VERSUS PLATTER- IT ENDS AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE DISCUSSION I'D LIKE TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR SAUSAGE HOW DO WE MAKE THINGS MORE EQUITABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE RIGHT AND I THINK WE START BY NOT VIEWING POLICY HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO THE MYOPIC LENS OF- CITY. CITY FOLK CITY COMMUNITY. RIGHT- AND SO. I'M GONNA LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE DISCUSSION AND I'M GONNA TRY TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN HEART AND OPEN MIND ABOUT WHERE YOUR MOTIVATIONS ARE AND MAYBE KEEP THIS DISCUSSION GOING- BUT I GOTTA SAY THE NOTION OF A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME- I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK- MAKES LOTS OF SENSE I THINK IF WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROUTE WE NEED TO. TAKE A DEEP LOOK AT ALL OF THE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS RIGHT IN THE FOR SPENDING MONEY CURRENTLY ON SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE OR DON'T WORK. FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE THAT MONEY MAYBE WE ARE PUT INTO UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OR SOME OTHER- AVENUE WHICH WHICH WE CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE. HAVE A MORE AFFORDABLE BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AS IT IS- YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT TWO AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DOOR. MOST STATES IN THIS NATION WITH YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BUDGET PRETTY NICE HOUSE. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIANS OVER CITIES IT MIGHT BUY YOU. A STUDIO AFFORDABLE APARTMENT RIGHT. THAT'S INSANE AND IT'S GOT TO STOP AT SOME POINT IT'S GOT TO STOP BY OUR URBAN. LEGISLATORS OF WHICH YOU'RE PART OF THAT DELEGATION RIGHT- COMING TO GRIPS WITH NOT JUST PUSHING ALL THEIR PROBLEMS ON EVERYBODY ELSE. AND THEN ASKING FOR SUBSIDY BUT ATHER LOOK AT IT REAL REFORM AND A REAL EVALUATION OF HOW DO WE SPEND OUR TAX DOLLARS- IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY AND MAYBE YOU HAVE AN IDEA THAT'S WORTH. PURSUING BUT- I'D LIKE YOUR COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE PURSUING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING WILLING TO REALLY. TACKLE TOUGH ISSUES AND NOT JUST- YOU KNOW NOT JUST HAVE HASHTAGS ABOUT TOUGH ISSUES WHICH IS WHAT I FIND WITH TOO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES SO. I WITH THAT CRIMINAL TO CONSIDER- SUPPORTING THIS AGO MILITIA THE REST OF DEBATE BUT. I DO HAVE SOME MAJOR CONCERNS OR- MISTER LEVINE AND THEN- MISS. OF JEWS AGREES. TO DO YOU WANT TO BE CALLED. OKAY EVERYONE WE HAVE THREE MORE BILLS TO GET THROUGH IN ONE HOUR I JUST WANNA PUT THAT ON EVERYONE'S RADAR. MR LEVINE AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YEAH THIS IS A FAT FASTENING CONVERSATIONS SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR AUTHORING THE BILL IN AND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR THOUGHTFULNESS. ON THIS AND I I'VE WRESTLED WITH- YOU KNOW WITH WHAT IS A SAFETY NET AND WHAT THE PEOPLE NEED TO ECONOMICALLY SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA AUTHORED TWO BILLS TO. TIE A MINIMUM WAGE THE COST OF HOUSING IN IN CALCANEUS WHERE PEOPLE WORK- THAT HAVE DIED IN APPROPRIATIONS WHERE I EXPECT THIS BILL TO DIE- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO IT. BUT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY AND ONLY GIVE OUT A PRESENT WHICH IS I'M GONNA SUPPORT A BILL. SO VERY VERY GENEROUS ON MY BIRTHDAY. IS THIS IS YOU KNOW I'M NOT A TRUE BELIEVER IN U. B. I. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS YOU KNOW I'M I'M LEARNING ABOUT IT. AND WE'RE SEEING DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD THING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S VERY EARLY ON BECAUSE WE'RE JUST SEEN A YOU KNOW A GROWING OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS AROUND THE STATE SO YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO BUT WE NEED TO SEE MANY MANY MORE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S RIGHT AS WELL AS WHAT'S RIGHT IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WHAT HELPS PEOPLE. ON IN EACH COMMUNITY MY CONCERN ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS GOING WILD WITH SO WHAT WERE THEY WANT THEY WANT TO. GET AN EDUCATION THEY WANT TO. YOU KNOW GET GET A CAR TO GET TO WORK ON MAYBE GET SOME HOUSING THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT BASICALLY- IN MARIN. THEY'RE DOING ONE BASED ON LOW INCOME MOTHERS OF COLOR. AND I'M REALLY FASCINATED BY THIS THEY'RE GONNA CHOOSE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. A LOT MORE QUALIFY AND THEIR BASE SEEN WHO CAN QUALIFY OFF OF WHAT'S CALLED THE SELF SUFFICIENCY STANDARD. DEVELOPED BY THE INSTITUTE CENTER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OAKLAND THE SELF SUFFICIENCY STANDARD FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO CHILDREN. IN MARIN IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PLACE- SO WITH THIS EXPERIMENT THAT THEY'RE HAVING THAT THE- DATA SAID THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE. YEAH THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET SOME HEALTHY FOOD INTO THEIR CHILDREN'S YOU KNOW TIME IS. A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO LIVE- REALLY SOME BASIC THINGS HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALSO CREATE A SAFETY NET FOR THEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COSTS THAT COME OUT. FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. SO I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THESE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS POP UP ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO INFORM. BILLS LIKE YOURS I THINK SELECT COMMITTEE IS A GREAT WAY. TO FURTHER EXPLORE PROBABLY A LITTLE EARLY TO CREATE. A STATEWIDE ELIGIBILITY. BECAUSE I JUST DON'T KNOW. IF THAT'S IF THAT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH BUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK WERE FULLY INFORMED YET BUT LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. RATHER THAN- CLOSE THE DOOR ON IT THANK YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU. ISRAEL THIS. THANK YOU- YOU KNOW I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THE CONCEPT OF A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME- I BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A UNIVERSAL BASIC BUT I FEEL THAT- IT SHOULD BE THROUGH A GOOD JOB RATE AND WE WANT TO WORK YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A LOW INCOME DISTRICT- WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE HOURS TO GET TO WORK. TO GET A GOOD PAYING JOB- AND- AND BECAUSE OF THAT I KNOW THAT- PROGRAMS LIKE THIS COULD BENEFIT A LOT OF FAMILIES BUT- I STILL THINK THAT A GOOD JOB IS WHAT. WE NEED TO BE PROVIDING I KNOW THAT TAKES A LOT LONGER- AND- EVEN THOUGH AT I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE ISN'T A FUNDING SOURCE- AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSES- BUT I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL. TODAY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING ON I KNOW THIS ISN'T A ONE YEAR. BILL RIGHT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY MULTIPLE YEARS. ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW I COMMEND YOU FOR STARTING THIS CONVERSATION- FOR OUR STATE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. TO BE LAUDABLE AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THERE'S NOT REALLY A LOT OF DATA OUT THERE. THAT WE CAN TURN TO I THERE ARE SOME BAY AREA CITIES THAT HAVE STARTED VERY NEW PROGRAM STOCKTON I KNOW HAS THE PROGRAM GOING. AND A REPORT HAS JUST COME OUT RECENTLY BUT IT ONLY INCLUDES ONE YEAR'S WORTH OF DATA. SO JUST REAL QUICK I KNOW WE HAVE A OTHER BILLS TO HEAR- TO THE QUESTION A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORS HOW IMPORTANT. IS IT TO THE CONVERSATION THAT THIS BILL LEASES. GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVE A GRAYSON. ABSOLUTELY I I'M NOT TRYING TO. MAKE ANY TYPE OF. A STATEMENT THAT THIS IS FULLY COOKED. IN FACT I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THAT. THE PRICE TAG WHICH STREET BECAUSE IT WAS. THIS IS NOT A FEASIBLE SOLUTION BUT LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. WE'RE HAVING DIALOGUE ABOUT THE POLICY OF BASIC INCOME. AND BY THE WAY WE'RE SEEING MANY ITERATIONS OF THIS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHY BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE HURTING EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS ARE HURTING IS THIS GOING TO BE THE SILVER BULLET NOT NECESSARILY OUR JOBS OF WHERE TO GO ABSOLUTELY. BUT WE ARE HAVING A DIALOGUE AND TO ALLOW FOR THE PUBLIC PROCESS. TO ALSO CURSED SUCHTHAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN ALSO SEE AND HEAR ABOUT THE POLICY CONVERSATION. THAT WE CANNOT JUST GO OUT AND MAKE THE STATEMENTS THAT YES THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO SOLVE ONE PROBLEM. AND WILL HAPPEN OVERNIGHT RATHER LOOK THIS IS WE ARE WE ARE DELIBERATE OF BODY AND HAVING QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION WITH IMPLICATION LOOK AT ONE OF THE DISTINCTIONS BEHALF WHICH FIND IT. AND HOW DOES THIS ADD UP GOING TO AFFECT IN COMPARISON TO SOME OTHER EXISTING PROGRAMS HAVE TO STRING SOME OTHER PROGRAMS OR NOT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WELCOME THE DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD AND THAT IS MY REQUEST. TO BE EQUALLY COMMITTED TO AS AN AUTHOR TO SAY THAT SHOULD THIS LEAVE THE COMMUNITY I'M ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. TO WORKING. OUT THESE ISSUES AS IT MOVES TOWARD. I'M GONNA TAKE THAT ARE CLOSE. BUT THEY DID JUST FINALLY. OKAY ONCE AGAIN THOUGH I WILL SAY THIS I DO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I'M WE DO SEE PILOTS PROGRAMS GOING ON AND I THINK ALL WITH A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY ONCE IN THIS CLEARLY IS NOT A ONE YOUR BILL THERE'S A HUGE CONVERSATION IN THE AUTHOR IS VERY WELL AWARE THAT. IS WHY WE TOOK THE FINDING OUT BUT IMPORTANT CONVERSATION NEVER THE LESS- I DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT SOMEONE JUST CHECKED INTO TO KIND OF GET THEIR PRESS RELEASE I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE THIS WAS A NEEDED CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CONVERSATION AS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PILOT PROGRAMS GOING THROUGH THE STATE AND THROUGH THE COUNTRY WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO COOK YES AND JUST VERY QUICKLY MADAM CHAIR. IT'S BIG IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE THAT WE'VE SEEN MANY CITIES. HAVE SIMILAR DURATIONS INTRODUCTION OF THIS AS WELL AS I INTRODUCED THIS LAST YEAR COVERED WE IT WAS HELD I REQUEST TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THIS TO ACTUALLY IRON OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON SOME OF THE V. SO I'M DEEPLY COMMITTED THIS IS NOT JUST GRANDSTANDING THIS IS TO HAVE A DELIBERATE OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE POLICY AND HOW THAT. M. FACTORS INTO HELPING AT PROTECT EVERYDAY CALIFORNIA'S WITH RESPECT AS FOR ADULT WOMEN TIME WHEN YOU CALL THE ROLL. SHE I. GREATLY OUT I'LL SECOND. FINE. RUSSIAN SB NATION- I- NOT WE ARE NOT GOING. RIGHT I. BEING YEAH THEY- THREE THREE LOWLAND ASIAN MARKETS. FOUR HOURS OF WORK HI WORK. THIS TIME RIVAS YEAH NO. WELL FIVE OF THEM AND- THEY'RE BUILT ON CALL THANK YOU I'M A SELLER WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO PREVENT YOUR BILL WE HAVE THREE BILLS AGAIN MEMBERS WE HAVE THREE BILLS LEFT TO GET DONE IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES. WE ARE. LOOKING FOR BREVITY. THE BILL. THANKS EVERYONE OF NO OKAY. THANK YOU- MANAGER THIS IS A DECIDEDLY MORE BORING TECHNICAL SCHOOL TRIED TO MAKE IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE- FOR SO I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF- I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RETURNING TO THE TIME FRAME AS TO WHEN A CITY OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CAN PURCHASE A TAX DEFAULT PROPERTY FROM THREE YEARS BACK TO FIVE YEARS THESE ELEMENTS ADDRESS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR THE CALIFORNIA REALTORS ASSOCIATION I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING OUT THE REMAINING CONCERNS WITH CAR BEFORE THE BILL IS VOTED ON ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. ADDRESSING THEIR REMAINING CONCERNS WILL BRING THEM TO A NEUTRAL POSITION WHICH I AM EAGER TO GET TO. AB FIVE TWENTY EIGHT SIX TO ENHANCE AND STRENGTHEN EXISTING CHAPTER EIGHT PROCESS FOR ACQUIRING IT AND WE HAVING TAX DELINQUENT HOMES. OUR FOCUS IS TO REMOVE ABANDONED BLIGHTED PROPERTIES FROM NEIGHBORHOODS TO GIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD IN WORKPLACES. AND REMOVE% TAX ILLEGAL PROPERTIES FROM THE CITY THE EARTH THEY COUNTY LEDGER. ALL THE WHILE KEEPING EXISTING TENANTS HOUSED IN INCREASING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. IN OAKLAND THERE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND SEVENTY ONE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN ANY GIVEN NIGHT. AND THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TEN OF WHOM ARE UNSHELTERED. THE LACK OF HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE BAY AREA HUSBAND HAS PUT TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON ON OAKLAND'S HOUSING MARKET. WAGES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR REMAIN STAGNANT THIS AND AS THE CITY BECOMES MORE GENTRIFIED INCREASING THE RISK OF EVICTION AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR REGION AND STATE CAN FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO BUILD AND PRESERVATIVES OR HOUSING. EXISTING LAW EXISTING LAWS GIVES NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES THE FIRST OPTION TO PURCHASE TAX DEFAULTED PROPERTIES. THREE YEARS AFTER TAX DELINQUENCY TO THE CHAPTER EIGHT TAX DEFAULT PROPERTY SALE. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE VACANT AND BLIGHTED SITES. OFTEN A CHEAPER PRICE TO TRANSFORM THEM INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONLY FIFTY FIVE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD THROUGH CHAPTER A PROCESS FOR WILL HOUSING PURPOSES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS FIFTY FIVE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. THIS DATA POINT PROVES THAT THE PROCESS IS UNDER UTILIZED. AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING NEEDS. AB FIVE TWENTY EIGHT SIX TO DO THAT- AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY MY STUFF AND COSPONSORS ARE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE TAX COLLECTOR. TAX TAX COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S ASSOCIATION AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE HOPES OF ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS AS WE MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. AND I PERSONALLY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM AND KEEPING THE DIALOGUE OPEN. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR- OUR NICOLO DELUCA WHO'S REPRESENTING THE CITY OF OAKLAND. VESTED IN CALIFORNIA. AND PEDRO DELGADO WITH NONPROFIT HOUSING. TIME WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESSES INTO THE PRIMARY WITNESSES WE DO HAVE A- WE HAVE TO BILL WAS LEFT AND WE- HAVE A MOST. AND A ALREADY WE WITH SO WE CAN GO CORPORATE. THANK YOU. REMEMBER BURKE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NICCOLO TELECARE BEHALF OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND WHEN THE CO SPONSORS WANT TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE STAFF. I LOVE BREVITY. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHEN DRAFTING THIS BILL TO THE CITY OF OAKLAND AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR DONE A PILOT PROGRAM Sí BILL. A LOT OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED WE PUT INTO THIS BILL WE ALSO WANT TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT'S WHY THE BILL USES IMAGE SUCH AS MAY AS OPPOSED TO SHALL. AND IN ADDITION WE ARE NOT ASKING TO WAIVE FEES OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLEARLY SAID OAKLAND AND OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAD. A MASSIVE HOMELESS PROBLEM WE'VE GOT A BALLOT ABANDONED HOUSES THAT WERE TRYING TO PUT INTO PRODUCTIVE USE GET BACK ON THE COUNTY LEDGER. PROTECT TENANTS AND IMPROVE CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS SO INCLUDING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MODERATOR WHICH BE WILLING TO THIS. SECOND AND. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAU PARKING BY SEAN MORAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME THE TITLE GONZALEZ I'M POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION IS TO FIGHT FOR A BAY AREA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN OUR STATE AND I NEED CALL ONE POINT TWO MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES CALIFORNIA DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BUILD AND PRESERVE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OUR ORGANIZATION AND PH'S COSPONSORING EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP CONVERT HOMES THAT HAVE PROBLEMS TAX WILL INCREASE THE INTO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROTECTING TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT. JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT THE BILL DIED- IT WILL HELP TENANTS WHO RAISED AND TAXONOMICAL PROPERTY BECOME HOMEOWNERS BY GIVING THEM A LIKE TO PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY BEFORE THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR TAX BILL IF THE TENANT DOESN'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY IT GIVES THEM A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO BE DEVELOPED PROPERTY AT A RENTAL OR SALES PRICES AFFORDABLE TO BATON. AT THEIR INCOME LEVEL. IT WILL ALSO INCREASE THE USE OF THE CHAPTER EIGHT PROCESS TO CREATE MORE PORTABLE HOMES BY CREATING A MORE PREDICTABLE PROCESS TO CONVERT TECHNICAL PROPERTY INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIRING THE CREATION OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND A STANDARDIZED PROCESS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER KATIE HARTMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I THINK HE IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE SELLING ONE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORPORATE WORK AND HE DID A GREAT JOB IN ITS OPENING THOUGHT IT OUT A COUPLE OF POINTS- ONE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW HAD REPORTED OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXPENDITURES- IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THE STATE BUDGET- WITH YOU KNOW 40% OF THE BUDGET DEDICATED TO EDUCATION THAT MEANS ABOUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS RE DIRECTED AWAY FROM CLASSROOMS IN THE FORM OF TAX EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR- WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE MORE TRANSPARENCY OVERSIGHT IF NECESSARY- THIS BILL IS NOT PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE ANY. AND EXISTING TAX EXPENDITURES THAT WATER AND WE PROVIDE THE STATE WITH MORE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING THE INTENDED GOALS- SO AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES PROVIDE AN ANNUAL TAX EXPENDITURE REPORT BUT THERE'S ONLY PROVIDE SORT OF A MINIMAL MINIMAL INFORMATION- AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A DEEPER TAX DIED ON SOME OF THOSE TAX EXPENDITURES- INCLUDING COMPARISON WITH OTHERS HE- WHAT THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ARE SO.

MISTER GREG. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIRMAN LICCARDO NOT UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER KIND OF WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE AND THE- THE BREATH OF THE POLICY HERE RIGHT I UNDERSTAND WE'RE LOOKING AT TAX EXPENDITURES- THINGS LIKE I ASSUME THE HOLLYWOOD TAX CREDIT THE TRACTOR TO ACTUALLY NOT THE HOLLYWOOD TAX CREDIT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO SUNSET ON IT. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT WE'RE SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE ONES THAT WERE DONE PRIOR TO ASKING FOR SUNSET THAT ARE THEIR PERPETUALLY AND- I LOOK AT THIS BILL SHOULD SOMEONE COME UP. WITH A PROPOSAL TO CUT ANY OF THOSE- THAT THEY WERE I HOPE THEY WOULD WAIT. UNTIL WE GET THIS FULL REPORT ON THE- CORPORATE TAX BREAKS TO DO NOT HAVE SUNSETS BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAS TEN PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING THAT AS CORPORATION. CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLY NINE NOW. AND ARE WE LOOKING ALSO AT- X. POLICY MORE GENERALLY LIKE- NO IT STARTED AT LEVI'S DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND ESSENTIALLY THE-&lt;/c&gt; WHAT THEY'LL SAY IS HERE'S WHAT ACROSS THE STATE. THESE ARE THE BENEFITS- LEGISLATURE YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME UP WITH. SO IF I WERE TO SAY TO YOU THAT THAT THAT THAT STRIKES ME AS IT'S MAYBE DUPLICATIVE OF THE WORK WE DO HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE NO BECAUSE OUR CHARGE WE ARE YOU'RE NOT LOOKED. AT IN DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE OF THESE PROGRAMS WE CLEARLY HAVE THE NUMBERS ON WHAT THE COST IS WHAT THE STATE SPENDING ON THEM WELL WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE- WE HAVE A WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND THE- WELL FOLKS THAT WE WORK THERE AND RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND ENERGY AND- I DON'T THINK THAT THE STAFF HERE HAS THE BAND WITH TO DO IT. WE DID TALK TO THE L. A. O. ONE TIME ABOUT HAVING THEM DO IT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR IT- BUT THE REASON WE TAKEN OUT. THOSE WITH THE CENTS A DAY AND THOSE WITH METRICS IS BECAUSE- THERE WAS A BILL AT. EVENTUALLY THAT SAID THAT ALL POLICY THAT CAME THROUGH- ALL EXPENDITURES THAT CAME THERE HAD TO HAVE EIGHT. HAVE TO HAVE METRICS INCLUDED IN THERE OR THEY COULD BE PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ACTUALLY WHEN THEY COME TO COMMITTEE. SO ANYTHING THAT'S PASSED THAT HAS ALL THOSE METRICS RIGHT. WE ARE WE REQUIRE THAT THOSE METRICS BE PART OF THE BILL. AS IT PASSES. THESE ARE SOME BILLS THAT WARRANT DID NOT HAVE SENT THAT DAY OR METRIC REQUIREMENTS. AND SO THESE ARE BUT A LAYERS. AND MEASURE ALL ALONG THAT LINE OF THINKING THAT WHY DON'T WE JUST INSERT SUNSET DATE SUNDAY. EVERY TAX POLICY WE DO NOT ACTUALLY AT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT WE- WE HAVE THE- GUYS TO DO THAT TODAY WITH THIS COMMITTEE. YEAH WE DON'T. IF THAT'S I WANT TO BRING UP EACH ONE OF THOSE BILLS BUT SO. BUT IN ATHENS THIS WAS A WAY OF ACTUALLY GETTING A STUDY TO EVALUATE ALL OF THOSE THAT ALL OF THE ACTUAL. HOW IF THESE CUT BUT THE EFFICACY OF ART OF THE TAX CREDITS. BECAUSE WE DID NOT REQUIRE IT BEFORE. SO IT JUST IT GIVES ME PAUSE I MEAN THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO SKIN A CAT. I THINK IT IT LEADS US IN THE DIRECTION WELL. HEY IT'S SUGGESTS TO OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND EVEN WITHIN. OUR OWN INSTITUTION HERE- WHICH WORKED AT. THAT THERE'S A RIGHT ANSWER RIGHT RATHER THAN. I WOULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT I ATTACHED POLICIES REALLY MATTER TRADE OFFS RIGHT- WHAT. ONE SUBCENTRAL CALIFORNIA'S MATE MAY DO WELL UNDER SOMETHING WHILE ANOTHER SUFFERS OR VICE VERSA- AND IT JUST GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF RESERVATION. THAT WE TRY TO OUT SOURCE OUR WORK HERE THE EGISLATURE- IT IN IN THE PURSUIT OF. AND BY NO MEANS LIMIT LET MEGO AHEAD SAY I AGREE WITH YOU. MORE INFORMATION IS BETTER THAT THE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULDN'T. AVAIL OURSELVES OF THOSE RESOURCES I JUST DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED A BILL TO DO SO I GUESS. WELL WE DO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH AND FRANKLY. THIS WOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT. VALUATION YOU DON'T WANT THE LEGISLATURE WHICH MIGHT NEED TAXES MAKING THIS EVALUATION. IN FAIRNESS WE DO HAVE LOTS OF ELSE OFFICE THE WE HAVE THE STATE AUDITOR DAVE GRAHAM THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY WE ASK THEM LAST YEAR. WILL WE CAN INCREASE THEIR BUDGET INCREASE THE CAPACITY I'M JUST TELLING YOU WE DID GO TO THEM AND THEY DID NOT THE CAPACITY AND THE BUDGET FOR THEM TO DO IT WAS LARGER THAN THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE THIS WAS AN EFFICIENT WAY TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION. AND BE. OSZYCE WHAT ARE DOLLARS. I AM STILL HAVE AN OBJECTIVE OPINION ANALYSIS. FOR THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT BEING WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ANALYSIS ORIGINALLY IS NOT AND IF WE WERE TO ASK ONE OF THOSE GROUPS TO DO IT SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY WOULD HAVE TO FARM IT OUT AS WELL YOU DON'T WANT TO HIRE A BUNCH TAX EXPERTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE ONCE. SO EITHER WAY YOU'RE LIKELY TO THIS WAY IT'S TRANSPARENT WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DO IT IT'S A PARTICULAR BRANCH IF YOU SEE. I APPRECIATE THE- THE EXPLANATION AND ARE YOU. OPEN TO OUR CONSIDERATION FOR THIS POLICY TO OPEN IT UP TO. A BROADER ARRAY OF TAX POLICY INCLUDING- YOU KNOW HOW WE EVALUATE OUR TAX SYSTEM YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT- WHY NOT RELAYING THE TAXES IF THOSE ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. PLACES TO YEAH WE CAN LOOK AT A NEW BILL NEXT YEAR I'M RIGHT NOW WITH LIMITED-HEARINGS I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS BILL IS NARROW AS IT IS. BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE FOR NEXT YEAR IT KEEP ME POSTED OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BEFORE AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS- YOU KNOW FOR. PROGRAMS WHEN WE ACTUALLY DON'T RIGHT NOW AND- I'M A BELIEVER THAT. SOME OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES WERE GONNA LOOK AT AND SAY OH MY GOD THAT IS A GREAT. USE OF CALIFORNIA FUNDS LET'S DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT AND MAYBE SOME OTHERS WE REALIZE THAT. NOT GET OUR MONEY BACK FOR THAT. CAN I JUST I'M ASK A QUESTION THE- SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND MADE THE POINT THAT THEY WERE SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION METRICS WHICH- FRANKLY KNOWING YOU FIND SO MUCH HARD TO BELIEVE CAN YOU JUST GIVE US KIND OF THE ONE MINUTE. VERSION OF HOW THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THE BENEFIT SIDE. IT'S SIDE IS GOING TO BE BY ITS NATURE. DIFFICULT IF IT WERE EASY WE COULD ASK THE AUDITOR TO DO IT- SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD SAY. WE HAVE A PRTICULAR TAX BREAK THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS THAT'S THE PART WE NOW. THE QUESTION WILL BE A FOR EXAMPLE IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER STATES IF IT'S LOWER. WE'LL FIND THAT N AND WE MIGHT THEN WORRIED THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOSE USINESS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SIDE TAX BREAK IF IT'S MUCH HIGHER COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. THEN WE SHOULD. TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE CORPORATIONS THAT WOULD- BENEFIT FROM THIS TAX BREAK TO THEY LOCATE IN OUR STATE OR DO THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT'S WHAT WE WILL TRY THAT'S WHAT WILL BE DONE TO THAT EXTENT- AGAIN THE INFORMATION'S GOING TO PRESENTED TO US. SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT WILL HAVE A HEARING AND IT'LL BE UP TO US WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO PURSUE THOSE THERE WILL BE NO RECOMMENDATION THEY'LL SIMPLY PRESENT THE FACTS AS THEY SEE THEM. AND THAT'LL BE AT. AND WILL WE TAKE THINGS LIKE THAT DIRECT AND INDIRECT JOB GROWTH INTO ACCOUNT AND WILL THEY BE CREATING SOME SORT OF A MODEL FOR ESTIMATING THE ECONOMIC. IT'S AN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GENERATED BY THESE. EXPENDITURES ARE TAX INVESTMENTS AS YOU MIGHT WANT TO YES IT SHOULD BE DIRECT. WE HAVE THESE CORPORATIONS COMMAND AN INDIRECT BECAUSE WE IF WE DON'T GET THOSE CORPORATIONS COMMAND WHAT ELSE ARE WE MISSING SO YES YOU WOULD HAVE THAT AS WELL. YEAH AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION- AS IN SUPPORT. AND SEEING THAT DR BURKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I ASKED FOR A VOTE. BUT THAT IS HIGHLY KALRA.
