WILL BEGIN OF COURSE WE KNOW

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:27.084
THAT SINCE THE PANDEMIC-

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.653
TEACHERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.788
LINE TRYING TO MAKE SURE WEGET

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:31.923
ITS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.591
LEARNING AND WE DO HAVE A

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.560
SHORTAGE ACROSS. OUR STATE AND

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:51.976
HOMETOWN OF SACRAMENTO BUT ALSO

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.911
ACROSS THE STATE. SO WITH THAT

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:55.012
WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TODAY'S

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.881
HEARING WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:58.983
AND BRING UP THE FIRST PANEL WE

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.686
HAVE THE L. A. O. YOUR IN PERSON

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:04.255
AND EVERYBODY ELSE I BELIEVE IS

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:18.469
PARTICIPATING VIA. WEBEX.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:19.604
GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.972
ANNUALLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.107
ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THIS MORNING

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.408
I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.843
OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.312
EDUCATOR WORKFORCE CAPACITY AND

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.181
ASSOCIATED RECOMMENDATIONS. I

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:31.849
WILL PLAN TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.184
WHAT THE TEACHER PIPELINE LOOKS

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.885
LIKE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:37.154
THEN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.422
THINGS MAY HAVE CHANGED

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.423
SUBSEQUENTLY. SO PART OF THE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.591
PANDEMIC I THINK WE ARE ALL

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.727
AWARE OF THE CHRONIC AREAS OF

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:43.694
TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT WE HAD IN

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.129
THE STATE THAT WERE SUBJECT

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:47.298
SPECIFIC AND AFFECTED CERTAIN

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:49.634
SCHOOLS MORE. SO IN TERMS OF

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.335
SUBJECTS WE KNOW THAT SPECIAL

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:52.370
EDUCATION THE STEM FIELDS OF

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.038
SCIENCE AND MATH AND BILINGUAL

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.673
EDUCATION WERE MORE LIKELY

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.174
CHALLENGING TO STAFFORD

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.709
DISTRICTS. IN TERMS OF THE

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.011
SPECIFIC SCHOOLS ARMORED

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.912
AFFECTED LOW INCOME URBAN

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.981
SCHOOLS AS WELL AS RULES SCHOOLS

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.383
HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGES

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:07.418
RECRUITING AND RETAINING

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.487
TEACHERS. NOT TWO YEARS HAVE

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:12.123
PASSED AND- THE PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:13.224
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.392
UNDERGONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:16.661
STRAIN AND STRESS THE QUESTION

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:19.063
THEN BECOMES WHERE DO WE STAND

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.265
NOW. THE FIRST YET THERE IS A

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:21.832
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THIS

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:22.967
QUESTION AND NO SATISFACTORY

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.568
ANSWERS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.704
LOT OF MEDIA REPORTS AND TALKING

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:27.505
TO THE TEACHERS THAT WE'RE

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.306
FAMILIAR WITH WE KNOW THERE HAS

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.075
BEEN A LOT OF. A PANDEMIC

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.944
RELATED WORK STRESS- BUT I THINK

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.946
WILL ALSO GO THROUGH. SOME

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:36.681
PIECES OF DATA TODAY THAT KIND

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:38.916
OF SUGGESTS THAT. CONCERNS ABOUT

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.551
MASSIVE ACCIDENTS OUT OF THE

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.619
TEACHER WORKFORCE MIGHT NOT

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.554
NECESSARILY BE GROUNDED IN THE

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.089
DATA THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW. SO

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.424
AND TO SORT OF INFORMAL

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.325
CONVERSATION I WANT TO DISCUSS

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:49.960
SOME FACTORS THAT MAY BE DRIVING

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.729
UP DEMAND FOR TEACHERS AS WELL

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.531
AS DRIVING DOWN DEMAND AND THEN

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.066
WE'LL DISCUSS SOME INDICATORS

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:56.834
THAT WE USUALLY LOOK AT WHEN.

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.002
GAUGING I TEACHER SUPPLY AND

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.404
DEMAND. SO FIRST ON FACTORS

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:03.007
DRIVING DEMAND- THEIR TWO KEY

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.308
FACTORS THAT I WANT TO DISCUSS

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.911
TODAY. THE FIRST IS WE KNOW THAT

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.946
KUBICA CELEBRATED SOME TEACHERS

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.781
LEAVING THE WORK FORCE EARLY I

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.416
THINK THIS FALLS INTO GROUPS SO

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.452
FIRST TO TEACHERS THAT LEAVE THE

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:18.889
PROFESSION EARLY. BEFORE

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:20.357
RETIREMENT AND THEN SECOND IS.

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.359
COMMENTS SO AGAIN A LOT OF STE

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.728
WORKING CONDITIONS A LOT OF

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:24.628
HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS BURN

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.231
MAY HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:27.865
TEACHERS TO JUST WANT TO LEAVE

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:29.300
I'M LOOKING FIRST AT THE PERFECT

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.935
TEACHERS THAT LEFT THE

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:31.836
PROFESSION EARLY SO THAT THE

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:32.937
STATE DOESN'T REALLY COLLECTED

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.805
DATA ON TEACHERS THAT LEAVE THE

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.574
WORK FORCE EARLY SO IT'S A BIT

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.343
UNCLEAR AT IN TERMS OF THIS AREA

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.113
BUT THERE IS A RECENT SURVEY

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:42.747
DATA FROM JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.348
ONE THAT REPORTS THAT THERE IS A

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.684
7% INCREASE IN TEACHERS WHO WERE

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:48.619
MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE THEIR

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.121
CURRENT JOB DUE TO PANDEMIC

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:52.089
RELATED STRESS THAT IN TYPICAL

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:54.458
YEARS- ADDITIONALLY THERE'S ALSO

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.627
FEDERAL DATA THAT. IT COLLECTS

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.095
THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND

00:39:58.162 --> 00:39:59.864
RATES OF INDIVIDUALS LEAVING

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.899
CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WE KNOW THAT

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.301
PUBLIC EDUCATION ACTUALLY HAS ON

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:06.036
THE LOWER END OF QUICK RATES

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.938
COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.640
SO THAT SORT OF HELPS SET THE

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:10.875
GROUND SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.476
ABOUT- TEACHERS LEAVING AND IN

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:14.378
THESE TWO PIECES I THINK THERE'S

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.880
KIND OF MIXED EVIDENCE THEY'RE

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.481
NOT TALKING ABOUT TEACHER

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:20.584
RETIREMENT DATE AT SO LAST YEAR-

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:23.587
THE CALIFORNIA AS SEATED TEACHER

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:25.422
A PENSION SYSTEM CAL STIRS

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.791
RELEASED A BLOG POST THAT

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:29.226
SUGGESTED THAT IN THE FIRST SIX

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.662
MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:34.031
SAW A 26% INCREASE IN TEACHERS

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:34.632
RETIRING IN THE FIRST HALF OF

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:37.201
THE YEAR. BECAUSE A FAIR AMOUNT

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.002
OF CONCERN WE SINCE CHECKED IN

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:39.603
WITH POSTERS AND IT SOUND AND IT

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.639
LOOKS LIKE A TEACHER RETIREMENTS

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:44.441
WERE UP 8% AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:46.644
OVER PAST YEARS- WE INTERPRET

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.713
THE EARLIER DATA- OF 26% AS MANY

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.582
TEACHERS WERE PLANNING TO RETIRE

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.417
LATER ON IN THE YEAR INSTEAD DID

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.419
SO DURING THE YEAR MOST LIKELY

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.954
RETIRING WAS A LITTLE BIT EASIER

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.522
THAN DEALING WITH THE LOGISTICS

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:59.857
OF DISTANCE LEARNING AND

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:02.293
ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES- THE EARLY

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:05.062
TRANSFER TWENTY TWENTY ONE-

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.096
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YOU ARE ON

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:09.500
TRACK WITH PRIOR TRENDS- SO

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.901
AGAIN TEACHER RETIREMENT DATA

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.603
WAS HER. ACTED BUT NOTHING TO

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.206
INDICATE MASSIVE AT CONCERNING

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:19.877
CRISIS LEVELS AT THIS POINT. THE

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:20.711
SECOND FACTOR I WANTED

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.379
DISCUSSING OF DRY UP TO ME. IS A

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:23.948
PROGRAM EXT. SO WE'VE ALREADY

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:24.982
DISCUSSED IN THE SUB COMMITTEE

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.417
THAT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:27.351
WILL BE EXPANDED IN THE NEXT

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.652
COUPLE OF YEARS AND DISTRICTS

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.888
WILL BE EXPECTED TO HIRE NEW

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.957
TEACHERS. WITH LOWER CLASS SIZES

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:33.858
AND THAT CREATES A DEMAND FOR

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:35.226
MORE TEACHERS AND ADDITIONALLY

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:36.594
THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PROGRAMS

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.629
THAT MIGHT PUT STRESS ON THIS

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.297
TEACHER SUPPLY FOR EXAMPLE. THE

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:41.532
GOVERNOR'S BUT JANUARY BUDGET

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.766
INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.902
PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR LITERACY

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:45.803
COACHES SOME OF THESE LITERACY

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.438
COACHES MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEACHER

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:50.174
CLASSROOM TEACHERS. AND SO THAT

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.375
MIGHT ALSO DRIVE UP DEMAND FOR

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:52.443
MORE TEACHERS. I'M NEXT MOVING

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.345
ON TWO FACTORS THAT MIGHT REDUCE

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.513
DEMAND I'M SO THEIR TWO FACTORS

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.648
THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:59.083
BRIEFLY HERE THE FIRST IS

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:01.285
DECLINING ENROLLMENT- OBVIOUSLY

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.387
THIS TREND PREDATES KOBE BUT

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.389
DURING COVE IT IN THE PAST TWO

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:06.790
YEARS WE HAVE SEEN AN

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:07.725
ACCELERATION OF DECLINING

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.126
ENROLLMENT TRENDS. THE QUESTION

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:11.095
THEN BECOMES ARE THESE SHORT

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:12.496
TERM TRENDS THAT ARE LIKELY TO

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.797
REBOUND IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.466
YEARS AS WE SEE. MORE STUDENTS

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:16.400
COMING BACK INTO PUBLIC

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.702
EDUCATION SYSTEM. OR ARE THERE

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:19.703
GOING TO BE LONGER TERM

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.171
STRUCTURAL IMPACTS TO PUBLIC

00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:23.173
EDUCATION THAT WERE NOT ENTIRELY

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.709
CLEAR ABOUT YET- AS DATA BECOMES

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.344
MORE AVAILABLE WE ARE CONTINUING

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.979
TO MONITORING THIS ADD TO

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:31.282
SPECIFIC FACTOR. I'M THE SECOND

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:32.750
FACTOR IN TERMS OF REDUCING

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.451
DEMAND MIGHT JUST BE BETTER

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:36.887
MANAGEMENT OF CODEPENDENT MAKE

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:39.890
STATE WIDE- IDEALLY AS- I SAID

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.692
SCHOOLS. UNDERSTAND HOW TO

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.893
HANDLE CASES AND OPERATES A

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.428
LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT SHOULD

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.130
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME TEACHER

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:47.698
STRESS RELATED TO HEALTH AND

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:50.100
SAFETY CONCERNS AND- HOPEFULLY-

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.568
KIND OF ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:52.937
ABOUT LEAVING THE PROFESSION

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.471
PROFESSION EARLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.674
PANDEMIC. NO NEXT MOVE INTO

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.909
INDICATORS OF THE TEACHER MARKET

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.711
AND THEY'RE TO DATE INDICATORS

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.379
THAT WE USUALLY LOOK AT HERE.

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.381
THE FIRST IS ESTIMATED TO

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:06.450
TEACHER HIRES VERSES NEWLY

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.252
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. SO

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.954
ESTIMATED TEACHER HIRES THIS IS

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.588
WHAT DISTRICTS REPORT TO CDP ON

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:13.390
AN ANNUAL BASIS IN TERMS OF. HOW

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:15.025
MANY VACANCIES AND NEW TEACHING

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.860
POSITIONS THEY EXPECT IN THE

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:17.928
NEXT FISCAL YEAR- THIS IS

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:19.630
USUALLY AN INDICATOR OF DEMAND.

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:21.332
IDEALLY THIS REFLECTS FACTORS

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.600
SUCH AS TEACHER RETIREMENTS

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.002
CHANGES IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.003
DEMAND IN DIFFERENT SUBJECT

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.105
AREAS AND SO ON. THAT WHEN WE

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.874
MATCH. THE DATA FOR DEMAND

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:33.277
ESTIMATED HIRES WITH SUPPLY FROM

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:34.845
NEWLY CREDENTIALED YOU'RE- A

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:36.380
CRITIC NEW ISSUE CREDENTIALS

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.983
FROM CDC FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.050
WE DO SEE A CONVERGENCE OF

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:42.386
TRENDS WITH ESTIMATED HIGHER IS

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.321
DECREASING AND NEWLY ISSUED

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:46.357
CREDENTIALS INCREASING. SO THIS

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.958
DATA ACTUALLY COULD SUGGEST THAT

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:48.993
THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:54.164
DEMAND IS. ACTUALLY NEARING IN

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.432
RECENT YEARS. I'M THE NEXT DATA

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:56.467
INDICATOR THAT WE LOOK AT IS

00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:57.468
EMERGENCY CURRENT-

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:58.769
PREMIERLEAGUE. THE OF WEAVERS

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.537
AND PERMITS AS IT SHARE OF TOTAL

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.573
WORK FORCE WHEN IT DISTRICTS

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:04.141
CANNOT HIRE FULLY PREPARE

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.576
TEACHERS FOR OPENINGS THE

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:06.643
USUALLY REQUEST EMERGENCY

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.846
CREDENTIALS FROM CDC. THE NUMBER

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:11.515
OF EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS ISSUED

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:14.952
ACTUALLY DROPPED BY 27% BETWEEN

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:15.686
NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.488
TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER THIS MAY NOT

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.256
BE REFLECTIVE OF ACTUAL DEMAND

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.458
GIVEN THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.593
AN EXTRAORDINARY AND HECTIC

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.528
SCHOOL YEAR AND- ALL SCHOOLS ARE

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.363
STILL IN DISTANCE LEARNING.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.699
LASTLY SHORT OF ANY DATA WE DO

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.534
HAVE AN ADULT DAUGHTER REPORTS I

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.635
THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF AT THIS

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.404
POINT. I SCHOOLS HAVE REPORTED

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.339
WIDESPREAD STAFFING SHORTAGES

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.108
AND VACANCIES IN THE FALL OF

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:38.675
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SOME

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:39.710
TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS.

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:41.211
HAVE REPORTED INCREASES IN

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:44.281
PROGRAM ENROLLMENT- SO WHAT I

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.616
THINK THAT'S JUST A QUICK RUN

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:46.784
THROUGH OF THE DATA INDICATORS

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.352
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AT THIS

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.686
POINT I THINK THE KEY TAKE AWAY

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:51.655
HERE IS THAT. THE DATA WE HAVE

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.590
AVAILABLE NOW DOESN'T SUGGESTS

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.125
THAT THERE IS A MAJOR TEACHER

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:57.227
SHORTAGE CRISIS BUT WE DON'T

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:58.662
HAVE THE FULL PICTURE GATT AND

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:00.297
IT'S- HARD TO TELL WHAT IMPACT

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.865
CORBETT HAD AND WILL HAVE ON THE

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.734
TEACHER MARKET- I THINK WE'LL

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:04.868
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:06.336
SITUATION. AS MORE DATA BECOMES

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:08.272
AVAILABLE. IN TERMS OF

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.274
RECOMMENDATIONS- WE MENTION IN

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.409
OUR EDUCATOR WORKFORCE ANALYSIS

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.178
THAT IT MIGHT BENEFIT THE STATE

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:16.480
TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS IN CASE

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.981
THERE IS A LARGER DEMAND FOR

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.850
TEACHERS THAN SUPPLY. IN THE

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.552
NEAR TERM DUE TO CODE IT I'M THE

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:23.387
STATE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.655
CHANGING TEACHER RECRUITMENT

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.657
APPROACHES EVERY FEW YEARS. AND

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:27.658
WENT ACTUALLY A FEW YEARS

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.593
WITHOUT ANY STATEWIDE TEACHER

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.595
RECRUITMENT INITIATIVES BEFORE

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:32.863
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE STATE

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.498
INFRASTRUCTURE AT SO THE STATE

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.766
CAN SWITCH BETWEEN TARGETED

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:36.700
RECRUITMENT FOR THE CHRONIC

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.569
SHORTAGE AREAS AND LARGE SCALE

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:40.671
EFFORTS SUCH AS POST KOBE. MIGHT

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:42.439
BENEFIT THE STATE AND WITH THAT

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:48.112
I'LL CONCLUDE MY- TESTIMONY. BUT

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:48.879

WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. STAFFING

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.873

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.274
FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT WORSENED

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:19.109
DURING THE PANDEMIC THE

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.077
COMMISSION'S ANNUAL TEACHER

CREDENTIAL AREAS. DESPITE THIS

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.195
OVERALL DOWNTURN HOWEVER

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.730
PRELIMINARY TEACHING IN SERVICES

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.665
CREDENTIALS ISSUED LAST YEAR

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.168
REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF ABOUT

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.003
15% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:47.471
NUMBER OF EMERGENCY PERMITS

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.640
ISSUED DECREASED BY ALMOST HALF

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:51.642
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH COULD

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:52.910
BE DUE TO THE INCREASED

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.378
AVAILABILITY OF FULLY PREPARED

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:55.846
AND CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AS

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.814
WELL AS THE REDUCED NEED FOR

THE CALL WITH YEAR OF SCHOOL

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.420
CLOSURES. I THINK IT IS TOO

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.088
EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THIS COULD

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.724
BE THE BEGINNING OF A TREND- THE

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.359
VOLATILITY OF STAFFING DURING

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:10.827
THE KOBE PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:12.362
MORE DIFFICULT THAN EVER TO MAKE

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.964
PREDICTIONS. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.666

00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:32.783
AND EXPECTATION THAT THE SUPPORT

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.251
WILL ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.819

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.061
KNOW IS THAT OVER SEVERAL YEARS

ABOUT HALF OF THE NEW TEACHING

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.497

PREPARING A CREDENTIALING AND

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:10.487

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:11.067
NUMBER AT THE VERY FASTEST RATES

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.336
IN SOME. AT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.937
WAS ALREADY A DIRE SITUATION

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:17.040
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE DECIDED

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.107
TO LEARN HOW CALIFORNIA

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.009
DISTRICTS WERE EXPERIENCING

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.811
RETIREMENTS RESIGNATIONS

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.546
VACANCIES AND HIRING DURING THE

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:26.382
PANDEMIC IN SUMMER TWENTY ONE WE

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:27.150
SURVEYED DISTRICT

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.151
SUPERINTENDENTS AND

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.585
ADMINISTRATORS FROM TWELVE

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.686
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:32.655
INCLUDING EIGHT. OF THE LARGEST

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:37.226
AND FOR SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:38.027
AS WE KNOW THAT THEIR CHALLENGES

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.562
CAN BE DISTINCT IN TOTAL THESE.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.330
ARE ONE ANSWER CAL STUDENTS.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.399
COMPARED TO PRE COPING YEARS WE

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:44.734
FOUND THE DISTRICTS HAD MORE

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.102
TEACHER VACANCIES BEFORE THE

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.804
BEGINNING OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.172
AND THOSE VACANCIES WERE HARDER

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.940
TO FILL. WE FOUND TWO PRIMARY

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:53.342
REASONS FOR THIS FIRST MANY

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.677
DISTRICTS ATTRIBUTED HIGHER

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:55.945
VACANCY RATES TO INCREASE

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.447
RETIREMENTS OR RESIGNATIONS OVER

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.782
PRE COOK YEARS. IN ONE LARGE

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.717
DISTRICT RESIGNATIONS INCREASED

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.920
BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS THAT'S

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:06.589
NEARLY 70% COMPARED TO BEFORE

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.591
THE PANDEMIC SMALL WORLD

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.259
DISTRICTS TOLD IS THAT LOSING

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.928
EVEN ONE TEACHER HAD A

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.163
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON STAFFING

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.099
OF COURSE OFFERINGS. THE SECOND

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:18.034
REASON DISTRICTS EXPERIENCED

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.402
GREATER VACANCIES THIS YEAR WAS

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.803
BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.271
ADDITIONAL TEACHING POSITIONS

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.040
WITH RECOVERY FUNDS THESE

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.842
POSITIONS WERE CRITICAL TO MEET

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.843
THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS COMING

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.978

HUNDRED FORTY EACH YEAR THIS

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:39.422
YEAR WE'VE HIRED THREE HUNDRED

SEVENTY FIVE SO FAR. EVERY

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:43.192
DISTRICT IN OUR STUDY HAD HIRED

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.861
AT LEAST SOME TEACHERS ON SUB

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.763
WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.265

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:57.340
MANY DISTRICTS WERE ALSO WORKING

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.375
TO MITIGATE THE SHORTAGES FIRST

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.476
DISTRICTS WERE INCREASING

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.777
COMPENSATION FOR TEACHERS AND

FOR STUDENTS- AND ALSO TO EASE

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.590
THE WORKLOAD ON TEACHERS WE KNOW

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.425
THAT WORKLOAD. AND STRESS

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.227
INFLUENCE TEACHERS FEELINGS

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.795
ABOUT STAYING IN THE PROFESSION.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.797
THIRD DISTRICTS REPORTED TAKING

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.282
COUNT ON HAVING A CERTAIN NUMBER

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:42.785
OF NEW TEACHERS IN HARD TO STAFF

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:43.920

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.221
DISTRICT MITIGATED SHORTAGES BY

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.722
INCREASING THE RECRUITMENT AND

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:50.660
HIRING CAPACITY TO BE MORE

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:51.627
COMPETITIVE. IN RECENT YEARS THE

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.763
STATE HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.064
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.900
RAISED IN OUR PREVIOUS TWENTY

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:58.467
TWENTY ONE TEACHER SHORTAGE

FOR THIS HEARING. AND YOU'LL

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.439
HEAR ON A LATER PANEL JUST LAST

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.774
YEAR THE STATE INVESTED OVER A

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.175
BILLION DOLLARS IN BUILDING THE

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:07.977

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.182
HAS ALSO INVESTED IN SUPPORTING

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.850
THE WORK FORCE WE HAVE WHICH IS

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:16.285
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. FOR

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.087
ADDRESSING SHORTAGES THERE ARE

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.189
INCENTIVES FOR NATIONAL BOARD

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.258
CERTIFIED TEACHERS AND FUNDS ARE

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.292
FOR THOSE PURSUING THAT

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.027
CERTIFICATION THIS WILL HELP

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.230
BUILD A POOL OF TEACHER MENTORS

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.232
TO SUPPORT NEW TEACHERS COMING

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.466
INTO THE FIELD. THE

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.801
RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR MOST

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.803
RECENT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:35.471
REPORT SUGGEST WAYS TO BUILD

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.906
UPON THESE INVESTMENTS AND

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.708
STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S ABILITY

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:40.343
TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN WELL

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.345

RECRUITMENT SIDE A STATE WIDE

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.715
RECRUITMENT INITIATIVE IS

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.750
CRITICAL BECAUSE NAVIGATING THE

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.285
PROCESS OF BECOMING A TEACHER IN

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.887
CALIFORNIA CAN BE COMPLEX. AND

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.356
DAUNTING. THERE ARE DIFFERENT

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.391
TYPES OF PREPARATION PROGRAMS

CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS. TEST

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.662
SPEEDS. AND MORE IT WILL BE

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.731
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO LOOK

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:04.166
BEYOND PROMOTIONAL OR MARKETING

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.669
CAMPAIGNS- AND TO REALLY ENSURE

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.004
THAT THERE ARE TOUCH POINTS FOR

CAREER COUNSELING THAT HELP

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.674
PEOPLE NAVIGATE THE PROCESS AND

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.576
ADDRESS POTENTIAL BARRIERS.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.544
HIGHER ADIPOSITY BUILDING IS

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.013
ALSO CRUCIAL TEACHER PREP

TO PREPARE MORE EARLY EDUCATORS-

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.594
WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL AS THE

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:32.662
STATE WORKS TO CHEAP UNIVERSAL

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.897
PRESCHOOL. I THE STATE COULD

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:35.865
ESTABLISH CAPACITY BUILDING

NEED FIELDS. THE STATE COULD

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.012
ALSO CONSIDER SUPPORTING TO PUSH

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.414
TO PROGRAMS THAT MAKE A TEACHER

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.382
PREP MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.517
CANDIDATES WHO MIGHT NOT ALREADY

HAVE. ACCESS TO TEACHER

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:58.287
EDUCATION THIS CAN SUPPORT RURAL

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.356
COMMUNITIES AND CAN HELP WITH

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.325
TEACHER DIVERSITY. INCREASING

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:08.731
MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN THE

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.666
FIELD. WHEN THEY'VE HAD ROBUST

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.868

I'M IN ADDITION COMPENSATION

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.274
MATTERS TEACHER SALARIES ARE

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.842
LOCALLY BARGAINED BUT THE STATE

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.378
CAN IMPROVE- TEACHER INCOME BY

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:23.946
REDUCING DEBT AND IT DRAFTING

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.848
HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE STATE HAS

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.750
TAKEN SOME OF THE STEPS FOR

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.352
EXAMPLE WITH THE GOLDEN STATE

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.587
PROGRAM. BUT A DIGITAL STEPS

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.055
COULD BE TAKE- RECENT OR ANTI

HAS HIGH DEMAND FOR ITS HOUSING-

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.070
AND TEACHERS WHO RECEIVE THIS

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:50.072
HOUSING HAVE ATTRITION RATES.

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.941
TWO THIRDS LOWER THAN THEIR

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.976
COUNTERPARTS WHO DO NOT. FINALLY

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.644
IMPROVED WORKING CONDITIONS ARE

01:06:55.711 --> 01:06:57.513
KEY TO RETAINING TEACHERS

THAT OF THAT WORK FOR SHORTAGE

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.854
CRISIS AND THEN ISSUE NUMBER TWO

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:40.890
IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIONS

NOW AND THEN HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:53.269
ASK QUESTIONS ON BOTH THESE TWO

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:56.005

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:40.648
DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:42.350
WORKFORCE- SO THE

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.919
SUPERINTENDENT- GATHERED A

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:48.756
COMMITTEE- TO COME TOGETHER AND

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:51.759

THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES EVENTS

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:20.828
SO THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:22.663
DO THAT. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY OF

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.532
PRACTICE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.467

48% OF OUR CURRENT ENROLLEES ARE

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:43.551

REALLY GOOD AND HAS BEEN

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:51.726
INCREASING OVER TIME. AND AS FOR

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:54.562
ETHNIC STUDIES WE ARE ON OUR WAY

AND THAT'S KIND OF THE BROAD

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:12.940
BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF AS BIG A

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:15.342
DISTRIBUTION IN THE EXISTING

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:18.779
ENDING INCOME WORKFORCE. AND IF

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.449
I COULD I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD ADD

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:23.417
ON TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN STATED

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:25.319
I'M WE HAVE LOOKED AT SOME DATA

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:27.888
SHOWING THAT- BLACK TEACHERS IN

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:30.124
PARTICULAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:30.791
ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.693
CALIFORNIA THROUGH. ALTERNATIVE

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.563
CERTIFICATION PATHWAYS OR- WITH

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.765
EMERGENCY STYLE CREDENTIALS AND

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.334
PERMITS IN FACT- FEWER THAN HALF

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.269
OF BLACK TEACHERS RECEIVE ANY

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:43.571
STUDENT TEACHING BEFORE BECOMING

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.106
A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:47.174
REALLY A SOBERING FACT. WHEN YOU

01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:49.343
CONSIDER THAT I'M HAVING THAT

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:53.180
COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION IS KEY

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:53.714
TO BEING RETAINED AND THE

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.716
TEACHER WORKFORCE AND SO WHAT WE

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.618
SEE IS THAT ACCURATE MANY

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:58.819
TEACHERS OF COLOR COME INTO THE

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:02.356
FIELD BUT THEN THAT- THAT LACK

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:04.091
OF PREPARATION CAN CREATE HIGH

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:06.127
TURNOVER RATES THAT UNDERMINE

01:36:06.193 --> 01:36:08.596
THAT GROWTH- AND SO YOU KNOW

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.131
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.166
THE RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT WHY.

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:13.734
TEACHERS OF COLOR AND BLACK

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:15.002
TEACHERS IN PARTICULAR MORE LIKE

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:17.104
TO LEAD TO ENTER THROUGH-

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.405
ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.741
PATHWAYS IN THE KEY. FACTOR

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:21.976
THERE IS THE COST OF PREPARATION

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.410
AND BEING ABLE TO ACCESS TEACHER

01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:26.480
EDUCATION- AND SO I THINK THIS

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:27.848
GOES BACK TO SOMETHING I

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:29.817
MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH IS THE

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:30.451
IMPORTANCE OF THOSE NAVIGATION

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.686
SUPPORT SO THAT- POTENTIAL

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:27.341
HELP. BUT IF YOU'RE A NEW

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.409
TEACHER YOU'RE LOOKING TO GO

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.811
INTO THE PROFESSION LOOK AT THE

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:31.779
POLITICAL DYNAMIC OUT THERE. ON

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.681
THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. RIGHT

01:37:33.747 --> 01:37:35.849
EDUCATION HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED SO

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.384
WHAT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:39.119
TO GET IN THE CLASSROOM WILL

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:41.388
BETTER PAY FOR SURE AND

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.523
SOMETHING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.757
ENOUGH UP HERE ALL THIS MONEY

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.426
INTO PROGRAMS IS GREAT BUT LOWER

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:47.461
CLASS SIZES WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.430
CLASS SIZES IN THE NATION THAT

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:51.131
SPEAKS TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:52.766
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM THE SIZE OF

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:55.069
A CLASS ALSO TEACHER MAIL. A SUB

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.804
OVER THE FALL THE CLASS SIZES

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:58.372
WERE LOWERBECAUSE MANY STUDENTS

01:37:58.439 --> 01:37:59.306
WERE THERE THEY WERE QUARANTINED

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.609
RIGHT SO IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.277
CLASSROOM HAVE TWENTY TO TWENTY

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:04.311

HAPPENS RIGHT THE TONE OF THE OF

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.149
THE DAY OF THE CLASS CHANGES SO

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:10.484
I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO TALK

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.886
ABOUT WORKING CONDITIONS AND PAY

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:15.122
NOT JUST ALL THESE PROGRAMS TO

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:17.524
LAND PEOPLE TO SCHOOL SITE. BUT

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.326

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:20.928
JUST THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.162
REAL DISCONNECT AND I APPRECIATE

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.764

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:50.090
FIVE POINT 33% KUALA AND THAT'S

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.558
CREATING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT A

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:53.527
LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS IN THE

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:54.061

PAY PEOPLE MORE MONEY WITH THAT

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:07.941
THAT'S ACTUALLY CREATING A

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.376
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT A STRUCTURAL

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.178

TWO THREE YEARS THEY'VE BEEN

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.572
THOROUGH. NOW WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.840
OUT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.108

FRIENDS EVEN IN MY AGE RANGE AT

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.649
ALL TRYING TO COME TEACHERS. BUT

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:56.650
THERE IS THE ONEROUS REALITY

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:57.885
THAT PICKUP TO BECOME A STUDENT

01:40:57.951 --> 01:41:00.621
TEACHER. YOUR PAYING TO WORK AND

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:02.189
THIS IS UNLIKE MANY OTHER FIELDS

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:03.724
WERE IF YOU BECOME A MEDICAL

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:04.591
PRACTITIONER OF SOME SORT YOUR

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:05.859
RESIDENCY YOU GENERALLY HAVE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:11.698
SOME SORT OF- CUSHIONED- ASH. IT

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.333
WOULD APPEAR PROVIDED FOR ABBOTT

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.436
THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.538
OUR SCHOOLS EVEN IN MY EAR IN MY

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.405
SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY IN

SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR PAT IT IS

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.342
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE AND

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.445
IT'S A HUGE BARRIER I THINK SO I

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:25.512
REALLY LIKE OBVIOUSLY HAVING OUR

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.815
PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE MORE

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:30.851
TIME NEW TEACHERS GET IN LIKE.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:32.486
THE GOLDEN STATE'S FUTURE

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:33.587
PROGRAMMING THE RESIDENCY

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:35.322
PROGRAM BUT I WONDER SOMETIMES

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.858
IF THIS IS IN ITSELF KIND OF

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:40.160
LIKE GOING BACK TO MR DONALD'S

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.728
COMMENTS KILEY CREATING MORE

01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:43.564
PROGRAMS A BUREAUCRACY FOR SOON

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:44.698
WE HAVE THINK ABOUT HOW TO

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:45.799
INCENTIVIZE BRING IN NEW

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:48.435
EDUCATORS AND NOT SAY WELL OKAY

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:50.871
WHEN I PUT UP ALL THIS WALL YOU

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:51.672
HAVE TO DO ALL THESE LITTLE

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.407
STEPS SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.509
ANSWER THIS QUESTION RIGHT NOW

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:56.643
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE MORE

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:57.845
COMPLICATED I DON'T KNOW IF WHO

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.680
WOULD BE THE RIGHT PERSON ASKED

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:01.215
US TO DO IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.516
COMMITTING ALMOST A BILLION

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:03.450
DOLLARS IN TE NEXT COUPLE YEARS

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.651
TO I INTO DEVISING OR

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:05.552
ENCOURAGING NEW TEACHERS A

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:07.488
RETAINING NEW TEACHERS ALWAYS A

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:08.889
STUDENT TEACHERS WOULD NOT BE

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.691
MORE SIMPLE FIGHT EVEN IN JUST

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:12.259
THE SAME CRITERIA TEACHERS TO

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:13.827
JUST GIVE THEM THE MONEY RATHER

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.562
THAN DOING ALL THESE ALL THESE

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:17.464
PROGRAMS BUT JUST ENCOURAGE THEM

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.566
TO HAVE THIS A WHILE YOUR

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:20.367
STUDENT TEACHER YOU ARE PROVIDED

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.802
FOR YOU HAVE COMPENSATION AND

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:23.437
YOU CAN DO THIS AND THEN YOU

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.138
COME OF TEACHER RATHER THAN

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:26.406
HAVING TO. WELL MAKE SURE IF I

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.808

THESE THINGS ON TOP OF BEING A

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:34.615
STUDENT TEACHER WOULD NOT BE

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:36.950
SIMPLER TO THAT I WONDER IF IT

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:38.018
WOULD COST MORE COSTS LESS

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:38.919
THAT'S MYKINDA GENERAL BROAD

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.420
BROAD QUESTIONS OUR PANEL SAYS

01:42:40.487 --> 01:42:41.555
WOULD IT COST MORE OR WOULD BE

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:44.358

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:45.459
PAY INCOMING SIN TEACHERS AT THE

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:47.528
RATE THAT WE'RE HAVING OR SEEN

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:52.799
THEM AT. OUR END WOULD BE.

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:53.967
SIMPLER JUST TO GIVE THEM THE

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:56.236
COMPENSATION. WHO'S THAT

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:58.405

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.978
THINKING MAYBE C. T. C. A. R.

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:11.785
CITY SOON SURE. WEALTHY I WISH I

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:12.819
HAD A GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:14.688
QUESTION I THINK IN AN IDEAL

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.123
WORLD AND IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:17.591
DO JUSTICE THEY PAY FOR THE

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:19.159
PREPARATION OF THE WORK FORCE.

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:21.228
WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAVE

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:23.130
ELECTED TO DO THIS. THROUGH A

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:25.799
VARIETY OF- OF PROGRAMS THAT DO

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.868
PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:29.436
INCOMING WORKFORCE THE RESIDENCY

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:31.271
PROGRAM. COULD B CONSIDERED A

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:33.407
PAID STUDENT TEACHING PLACEMENT.

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.876
OF FOR SOMEONE BRAIDED THAT-

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:38.245
MADE MAKING ALSO OF USE OF THE

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.646
GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT WE

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:42.449
HAVE SOME ABILITY TO- TESTS TO

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:44.384
PROVIDE SUPPORT IT CERTAINLY IS.

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.019
OF ALL BY ITSELF TWENTY THOUSAND

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:46.954
DOLLARS ISN'T NECESSARILY A

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.589
LIVING WAGE IN MANY PLACES IN

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:49.856
THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.525
BUT- I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE

01:43:51.592 --> 01:43:54.728
IDEA IN A WORTHWHILE QUESTION TO

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.697
STUDY- FOR NOW WE'RE HAPPY TO.

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:58.398
SUPPORT EVER INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:01.234
WORK FORCE. OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:02.369
IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT BEFORE

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:07.941
US. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR CAN I

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:10.611
AWAY AND QUICKLY SO I ANYWAY

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:11.845
FROM THE ALLEY GO I THINK I

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:13.714
WOULD JUST ADD TO THIS

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.616
CONVERSATION THAT. THE TEACHER

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:16.883
RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN THE GOLDEN

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.518
STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.087
THOSE ARE MORE TARGETED EFFORTS

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:21.588
THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:23.256
AREAS OF CHRONIC SHORTAGE THAT

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:24.625
WE EXPERIENCE OUT THINGS LIKE

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:25.993
SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE STEM

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:27.260
FIELDS BILINGUAL. AND NOW

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.795
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THESE

01:44:28.862 --> 01:44:31.531
ARE VERY INTENTIONAL TARGETS FOR

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:33.200
THESE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS I

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.735
THINK IN TERMS OF YOUR IDEA IT'S

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.970
JUST A CONSIDERING THE TRADE

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:38.105
OFFS BETWEEN BROADER. I'M FUNDS

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.640
FOR STUDENT TEACHING VERSES THIS

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.875
MORE TARGETED APPROACH THAT THE

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.877
STATE HAS TAKEN IN THE PAST.

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:48.649
THANK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY THANK

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:53.420
YOU MR DRY. OKAY YEAH I HAVE A

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.188
SERIES OF QUESTIONS SO AS WAS

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:58.992
NOTED BY MR LEE- WE APPROPRIATED

01:44:59.059 --> 01:44:59.860
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO THESE

01:44:59.926 --> 01:45:02.929
ISSUES. LAST YEAR BEING SPENT

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.364
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:06.500
YEAR JANUARY BUDGET THIS HAS

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.068
FIFTY MILLION CELL I THINK IT'S

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.970
BETTER TO LOOK AT THAT BILLION.

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.672
OUR HAS BEEN THE NEXT FEW YEARS

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:12.873
THAN JUST FOCUSING SOLELY ON

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.775
THE- ON THE FIFTIES OF COURSE

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:16.543
WERE DOING LITTLE OVERSIGHT

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.478
TODAY AND THEY GO GOING FORWARD.

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.880
I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE WE'VE

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:21.081
HEARD THIS FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:23.984
MEMBERS IS- YOU KNOW RECRUITMENT

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:26.553
AND RETENTION. L. WHAT'S MORE

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.121
IMPORTANT PROBABLY BOTH

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:29.489
IMPORTANT BUT WE KNOW WE'VE

01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:31.792
HEARD ABOUT AS THE- AGENDA NOTES

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:35.028
THAT THE TEACHER. SHORTAGE ISSUE

01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:36.396
FOR TWENTY YEARS SO I REMEMBER

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:38.498
WHEN I HAD THIS JOB. TWENTY

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.500
YEARS AGO THERE IS A CAL GRANT

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:41.768
PROGRAMS LANGUAGE THE CAL GRANT

01:45:41.835 --> 01:45:42.903
T. FOR TEACHERS BECAUSE IT WAS

01:45:42.969 --> 01:45:44.671
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE MONEY TO GO

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:45.972
THE TEACHER PROFESSION. SO WE'VE

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:48.675
BEEN ON THIS CASE FOR. A LONG

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:53.914
TIME. AND HELLO PORTENT SO WHAT

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:57.317
DO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MORE

01:45:57.384 --> 01:46:00.854
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND IS

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:02.522
IT THAT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE THAT

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:03.924
TEACHERS WHO AREN'T STICKING

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:06.493
AROUND IS THAT IT'S A STRESSFUL

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.863
JOB. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.298
ENOUGH I MEAN LITERALLY RIGHT

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:12.466
DOWN THE STREET OR HAVING A

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.800
DEBATE WITH MY LOCAL SCHOOL

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.603
DISTRICT ARE LOCAL TEACHERS.

01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:19.840
ASSOCIATION- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:21.742
MUCH WE CAN PUT INTO THESE

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:23.510
PROGRAMS THEY ALL GOES BACK TO

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:26.079
ARE WE ADEQUATELY FUNDING. OUR

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:29.216
SCHOOLS. WITH FLEXIBLE MONEY TO

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:31.785
ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE OUR

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.954
TEACHERS IN THIS WORK FORCE SO I

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.689
THINK WE'LL HAVE IDEAS ON HOW WE

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:38.291
CAN MAXIMIZE MONEY. TO OUR

01:46:38.358 --> 01:46:39.826
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COMING

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:42.062
MONTHS AND SELL WORKED AS PART

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:46.900
THAT FOR NOW BUT BACK TO- THAT

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:49.836
THE MAYBE I CAN ASK- THE L. P.

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:53.673
IRCTC. ARE ARE WE ON THE RIGHT

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.375
PATH ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:56.243
SPENDING ALL THIS MASSIVE

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:58.044
INFUSION OF MONEY THAT THE

01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:00.380
BILLION FROM LAST YEAR AND I

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:01.748
GUESS A FIFTY MILLION THIS YEAR

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.917
AND THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHT SPOTS

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:04.551
TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE I

01:47:04.618 --> 01:47:06.820
KNOW WE NEED TO PAY TEACHERS

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.455
WELL TO STICK IN THERE FOR THE

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:10.390
LONG RUN AND- MOST TEACHERS DO

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:11.792
IT NOT TO BECOME RICH BECAUSE

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.593
THEY LOVE THE JOB A LOT OF THE

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.829
KIDS. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:18.031
KNOW TAKE CARE THEM ALONG THE

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:18.765
WAY TO THEIR INCENTIVIZE TO

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:19.933
STICK AROUND. BUT OF THESE EXTRA

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.035
EFFORTS WERE DOING HOW DO WE

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:24.037
KNOW THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:26.840
PATH. I THANK YOU VERY SANTEE

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:28.175
WITH THE COMMISSION. I THINK

01:47:28.241 --> 01:47:30.544
IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR-

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:32.512
PROPOSITION- RECRUITMENT OR

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:33.880
RETENTION I THINK YOU HAVE TO

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:36.183
FOCUS ON BOTH. IF WE ONLY FOCUS

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:37.350
ON RECRUITMENT AND WE'RE NOT

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:40.320
INTENDED TO THE RETENTION OF OUR

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:42.589
WORK FORCE. OF WE WERE MISSING A

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:45.392
HUGE PART OF WHAT'S NECESSARY TO

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:46.793
KEEP A STABLE WORKFORCE IN OUR

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.695
SCHOOLS AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:49.763
THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE-

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:51.665
THE OTHER KINDS OF FACTORS. OF

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:53.700
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY LPI

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.836
AND OTHERS. SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:58.071
CRITICAL TO DO BOTH THINGS. I

01:47:58.138 --> 01:47:59.973
BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT IN

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.775
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE TEACHER

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:03.743
RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS AN

01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:06.146
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. LONG TERM

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.849
IT INITIATIVE- IT THE RESEARCH

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:10.450
ON RESIDENCIES IS THAT THEY ARE

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:13.119
PREPARING- TEACHERS WELL AND THE

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:13.720
TEACHERS WERE COMING THROUGH

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:15.422
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TEND TO STAY

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.057
IN THE PROFESSION. AND THIS IS

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:17.958
KEY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.125
ADDRESSING BOTH RECRUITMENT AND

01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:20.627
RETENTION BY PROVIDING SUPPORTED

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.929
WAY INTO TEACHING THAT

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:24.865
INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF. IS AN

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:27.334
IMPORTANT ARTIFACT THAT WE NEED

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.502
TO PROTECT AS WE MOVE FORWARD-

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:31.504
AND IDEALLY BEGIN TO REDUCE THE

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:32.739
SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:34.507
EXPERIENCING SO I THINK IT'S NOT

01:48:34.574 --> 01:48:36.710
EITHER OR- AND I THINK THE

01:48:36.776 --> 01:48:37.510
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS BEING

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:39.179
BUILT RIGHT NOW. AND PROVIDING

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.814
THAT THE FUNDING LIKE FOR THE

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:42.115
CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAMS FOR

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:44.317
LOCAL REGIONAL GROW YOUR OWN

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:46.186
EFFORTS TO BRING A MORE DIVERSE

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:47.821
COMMUNITY INTO THE INTO THE WORK

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.623
FORCE. THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.424
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT DO BUT

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:56.096
TEND. TO BOTH RECRUITMENT AND

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:56.696
RETENTION. SO LET ME FOLLOW UP

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:59.065
ON THAT IS A THERE RESEARCH.

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:01.534
FOCUSING ON. WHEN TEACHERS LEAVE

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.003
WHY THEY LEAVE IS BECAUSE IT'S

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:05.605
IF IT WEREN'T PROPERLY PREPARED

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:06.806
TO THE JOB AND RESIDENCIES

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:08.208
REALLY HELPS THAT. MAKE SURE

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:10.076
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUCCEED AS

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.978
ECONOMIC FACTORS OF COURSE PAID

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:14.814
WILL GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AS

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.549
MUCH STRESS. WHAT DO WE THINK IS

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:20.153
THAT IS THE FACTOR THERE MOST.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.488
REPORTING FACE I KNOW I KNOW

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.089
THERE'S RESEARCH OUT THERE AND

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.625
I'M WONDERING IF DESIREE CARVER

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:27.994
TANYA LPI. JANICE HERO HE ARE

01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:30.597
PROBABLY HAS DONE SOME RESEARCH

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:32.065
IN THIS AREA. YES MY PLEASURE A

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:33.133
DESIREE CARVER THOMAS THAT

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:35.335
LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE AND WE

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:38.305
HAVE STUDIED THE FACTORS THAT

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:40.774
IMPACT TEACHER RETENTION- AND

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.709
THERE'S SEVERAL FACTORS THAT-

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.345
ARE ARE INVOLVED- ONE ASPECT IS

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:47.948
ACCESS TO- AT CONFERENCE OF

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:49.716
TEACHER PREPARATION. SO WE KNOW

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.117
THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ENTER

01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:52.686
THE FIELD WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:55.689
PREPARATION HAVE- TURNOVER RATE

01:49:55.755 --> 01:49:56.890
THERE TWO TO THREE TIMES AS

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:58.591
GREAT AS THOSE WINTER WITH. THE

01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:00.226
MOST COMPREHENSIVE PREPARATION

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:03.029
WE ALSO KNOW THAT- ACCESS TO

01:50:03.096 --> 01:50:04.864
MENTORING AND INDUCTION- IS

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.299
ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:09.202
RETENTION- ACCESS TO GREATER

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:11.237
COMPENSATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:12.605
GREATER ATTENTION ENOUGH IS

01:50:12.672 --> 01:50:15.108
ALSO. THAT IMPORTANT RECRUITMENT

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:17.544
STRATEGY AS WELL- YOU KNOW

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:20.947
THERE'S- A HOST OF. WHERE

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:23.149
CONDITIONS THAT MATTER AND ONE

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.617
OF THE PRIMARY WORKING

01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:26.519
CONDITIONS THAT'S ASSOCIATED

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:30.023
WITH- TURNOVER IS ADMINISTRATIVE

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.191
SUPPORT SO THE RESEARCH SHOWS

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:33.259
THAT OUR TEACHERS WHO REPORT

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:35.195
THAT THEIR ADMINISTRATOR IT'S

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:37.430
NOT ENCOURAGING OR SUPPORTIVE

01:50:37.497 --> 01:50:39.366
LEAVE THE PROFESSION IT OR THEIR

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:40.934
CLASSROOMS THAT OUT MORE THAN

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:42.502
TWICE THE RATE OF INDIVIDUALS

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:44.237
WHO SAY THAT THEIR

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:45.105
ADMINISTRATION. IS SUPPORTIVE

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:46.639
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT I THINK

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:48.708
POINTS TO. THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:51.177
THIS OF SOME OF THE- INVESTMENTS

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:54.347
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN AT AT

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.216
TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY ONE C. SLA-

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:58.084
FOR EXAMPLE- AND ALSO THE

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:00.820
IMPORTANCE OF- THE INVESTMENTS

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:03.089
IN AS- IN PROFESSIONAL

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:04.491
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE EDUCATOR

01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:07.694
EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- WHICH

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:09.596
- CAN HELP TO YOU KNOW COULD BE

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:11.798
USED TO- DEVELOP. TEACHER

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:14.634
LEADERSHIP AND- AT AN EFFICACY

01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:17.037
SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARE

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:20.573
ASSOCIATED WITH- RETENTION AND I

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:21.541
WOULD. JUST ECHO THE POINT THAT

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:24.210
YOUR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION-

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:25.345
REALLY INEXTRICABLE- WE KNOW

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.714
THAT BEING BETTER PREPARED LEADS

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.716
TO BEING BETTER RETAINED- AND SO

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:31.751
THOSE THOSE REALLY GO TOGETHER

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:34.187
IN ADDITION. REDUCING TURNOVER

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:36.556
RATES REDUCES THAT THE DEMAND

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:39.359
FOR TEACHERS SO CALIFORNIA HAS

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.861
ABOUT AN EIGHT PERCENT-

01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:43.163
ATTRITION RATE PEOPLE LEAVING

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.331
THE PROFESSION IN THE STATE- AND

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:49.235
THAT IS- ABOUT AVERAGE AT ABOUT

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.303
A SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:57.710
AVERAGE- OF- ADD TURNOVER RATES-

01:51:57.777 --> 01:52:00.380
STATES- THERE OTHER STATES. AND

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:01.748
IN OTHER SCHOOL SYSTEMS AROUND

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:02.816
THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:05.385
WHERE- YOU KNOW TEACHERS STATE

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:06.753
OF LONGER THAN THEY DO HERE IN

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.521
CALIFORNIA AND SO IF WE COULD

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:11.024
REDUCE OUR- TEACHER TURNOVER

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:13.126
RATES TO BE COMPARABLE WITH HIGH

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:14.961
PERFORMING SCHOOL SYSTEMS. IN

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:16.329
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:17.964
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD YOU

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:19.532
KNOW THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NEED

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:21.301
TAPPED TO CONTINUALLY NEED TO

01:52:21.367 --> 01:52:23.703
HIRE MORE NEW TEACHERS SO THESE

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:25.972
REAL PEACE THESE ISSUES REALLY

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:27.474
PUT TOGETHER. SO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.843
THE TWO FACTORS WITH WITH

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:32.846
ECONOMIC- FACTORS COMPENSATION

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:37.417
AND- A JUST SALARY BUT YOU KNOW

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:38.852
BENEFITS AND SO FORTH WE'RE

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:43.857
SUPPORT WHAT DO WE FIND IS MORE

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:46.626
OF AN INDICATOR AS FAR AS PEOPLE

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:47.727
WERE LEAVING. THE PROFESSION

01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:51.297
EARLY ON. YEAH I IT I COULDN'T

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:52.932
SAY THAT WE HAVE ONE FACTOR

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:55.502
THAT- STAND OUT FROM THE REST IT

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:58.104
REALLY IS A FULL PICTURE- AND SO

01:52:58.171 --> 01:52:59.372
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.773
TEACHERS ON ON EACH OF THOSE

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.609
FRIENDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:04.511
HAVE THE COMPENSATION SO THAT

01:53:04.577 --> 01:53:06.446
THE DOLLARS AND SENSE OF WORK TO

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:08.248
BE A TEACHER- WHETHER THAT'S

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:10.216
THROUGH INCREASED SALARIES OR

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:12.452
LESS THAT. LESS STUDENT DEBT

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:13.520
LIKE THROUGH THE GOLDEN STATE

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:15.455
TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM OR BY

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:17.290
HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING SO

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.325
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:21.327
WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:22.795
THEN ALSO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN

01:53:22.862 --> 01:53:24.797
THEY COME TO SCHOOL THEY'RE IN

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:25.632
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.433
SUPPORTED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.502
YOU KNOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO

01:53:29.569 --> 01:53:31.037
THE POINT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:31.604
TEACHER DIVERSITY- TEACHER

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:32.839
WORKING CONDITIONS REALLY MATTER

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:34.974
FOR THAT- AND SOMETHING LIKE A

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.776
WORKING CONDITIONS SURVEY HELPS

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:39.112
OUT COULD HELP THE STATE. TO

01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:41.047
PROVIDE MORE TAILORED-

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:43.283
IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD SO

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:45.151
THAT WE CAN SEE DISAGGREGATE

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.419
WILL WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:48.121
MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS WHAT

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:49.022
ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR SPECIAL

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.423
EDUCATORS WHICH YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:52.125
WRITTEN A REPORT THAT SHOWS THAT

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:53.760
THEY'RE REALLY DISTINCT- WHAT

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:55.061
ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR TEACHERS

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:56.729
OF COLOR IN THE STATE WHERE ARE

01:53:56.796 --> 01:53:58.665
THERE PLACES THAT ARE DOING A

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:00.667
BETTER JOB AT RETAINING A

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:02.635
CERTAIN STAFF MEMBERS THAT. ARE

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:04.971
IN HARD TO STAFF POSITIONS- AND

01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:08.942
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THAT WAS

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.009
AND KIND OF SCALE ACROSS THE

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:11.544
STATE. SO LET'S LAST YEAR AS AS

01:54:11.611 --> 01:54:13.846
WAS NOTED BY MR LEAD TO STEPPED

01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:15.615
OUT WE HAD IT YOU KNOW ONCE IN

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.717
A- GENERATION TYPE OF A BUDGET

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.319
DID A LOT OF THINGS WITH. YOU

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:20.887
KNOW. BUT A BILLION DOLLARS INTO

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:23.423
THIS ISSUE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS

01:54:23.489 --> 01:54:24.824
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK OVER

01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:27.560
THE PAST DECADE OR SO AND SO

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:29.362
WHICH PROGRAMS WE THINK HAVE THE

01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:31.998
MOST. AMERICAN SUCCESS SO. WE'VE

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:34.367
SPENT THE LION'S SHARE ON THREE.

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:36.102
THAT THE TEACHER GRANT CONSIDER

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:37.904
GRANT PROGRAM TEACHER RESIDENCY

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.305
PROGRAM AND THE CLASSIFIED

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:41.774
EMPLOYEES CREDENTIALING. PROGRAM

01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:44.544
ON. THE TO MR MEDINA'S QUESTIONS

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:47.847
FAR AS- DIVERSITY IN. IT DO WE

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:49.649
HAVE. ANY INDICATION OF WHICH

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.584
ONES OF THESE. WOULD PRODUCE AND

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:53.653
SUPPORT A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.555
WHEN I WHEN I SAW FOR EXAMPLE

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:57.790
FROM THAT CLASSIFIED TEACHER.

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:59.559
PROGRAM WHICH I WORKED ON THAT.

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.628
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. YEAH THE

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:02.829
NUMBERS COMING FROM THAT WERE

01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.597
OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS

01:55:04.664 --> 01:55:05.665
DIVERSITY CAN LOOK WHO ARE

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.433
CLASSIFIED IN PLACE MOST LIKELY

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:10.169
VERY VERY DIVERSE- DO WE HAVE

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:12.438
ANY INDICATORS IS THAT. MAKING A

01:55:12.505 --> 01:55:14.607
DIFFERENCE IN THAT ISSUE ARE

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:18.745
SOME. MORE DIVERSE THAN OTHERS

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.713
THE THREE PROGRAMS. DAVID TO

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.815
CARE FROM. MISSION OF THE

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:26.019
CREDENTIAL- WITH WE CAN START

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:28.087
WITH LOOKING AT THE CLOCK OF

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:29.355
NINETY. ON EMPLOYEE FRIENDLY

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:33.092
PROGRAM. AND WE FIND THAT OVER

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:37.630
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- ONLY.

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:40.233
ABOUT 30% OF THE GRANT WENT TO

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.769
CANDIDATES WHO ARE WHAT THE

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:44.370
CLERK IS ALWAYS BEEN WHITE SO

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:47.073
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:48.741
ARE GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:50.476
. THE NUMBERS ARE SIMILAR WITH

01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:53.513
THE RESIDENCY GRANTS. SO I THINK

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:56.382
THAT THESE TWO PROGRAMS-

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:59.886
DEFINITELY ARE. ATTRACTING AND

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:02.121
MEETING THE NEEDS OF TEACHERS OF

01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:05.692
COLOR- I THINK IF YOU'RE-

01:56:05.758 --> 01:56:08.594
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:10.530
RETENTION I THINK WHAT DESIREE

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:11.931
CARVER THOMAS TALKED ABOUT TERMS

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:14.567
OF STATE WHEN I MET STUDIES LIKE

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.536
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THAT MAY

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:17.837
BE SOMETHING THAT THE

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:19.405
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LOOK AT SO

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.607
THAT YOU ARE GETTING NEARLY

01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:26.946
DATA- FROM. THE TEACHERS IN THE

01:56:27.013 --> 01:56:28.648
CLASSROOMS AS TO HOW THEY

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:33.019
PERCEIVE- BUT CONDITIONS IN

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:34.654
THEIR SCHOOL YES I GUESS WHAT

01:56:34.721 --> 01:56:36.422
I'M LOOKING AT IS IF YOU IF YOU

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:37.557
LOOK AT THAT THIS THE

01:56:37.623 --> 01:56:41.494
DEMOGRAPHICS OF. PARTICIPANTS IS

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:45.131
IT IS IT ABOUT OF THESE THREE IS

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.666
IT ARE THEY ABOUT THE SAME AT

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.468
THE EXISTING TEACHER WORKFORCE

01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:50.737
WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT GREAT. ARE

01:56:50.803 --> 01:56:53.005
THEY SOME MUCH HIGHER AND WHICH

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:56.142
ONES HAVE HAD ART HAS SHOW THE

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:58.010
MOST PROMISE AS FAR AS-

01:56:58.077 --> 01:57:00.780
DIVERSIFYING OUR WORKFORCE. SO

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.515
THE CURRENT TEACHER WORKFORCE IS

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.917
APPROXIMATELY 60%WHITE 40%

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:07.887
TEACHERS OF COLOR- THE RESIDENCY

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:11.357
GRANTS AND THE- CLASSIFIED

01:57:11.424 --> 01:57:13.426
SCHOOL EMPLOYEE GRANTS. ARE

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:15.695
DEFINITELY GOING TO MORE PEOPLE

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:19.399
OF COLOR- SO THOSE ARE THOSE

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:21.768
TARGETED GRANTS ARE WORKING- I'M

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:24.103
NOT SURE ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:26.906
SO MAYBE SOMEONE FROM C.

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:33.379
SACRAMENTO ABOUT ONE. MCCARTY

01:57:33.446 --> 01:57:35.214
THIS IS- JAKE PARTNER WITH THE

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:36.482
STUDENT AID COMMISSION I DON'T

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:38.451
HAVE- BRACE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:40.219
DATA OR DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OF THAT

01:57:40.286 --> 01:57:42.522
KIND TODAY WITH ME ON THE GOLDEN

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:43.489

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.594
BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND WHAT

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:23.696
ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE IN THE

01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:26.499
CLASSROOM- SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:58:26.566 --> 01:58:29.202
ADD THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:30.837
THAT THAT ARE. PERHAPS WITHIN

01:58:30.903 --> 01:58:32.772
OUR CONTROL ARE NOT IN OUR

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:35.541
CONTROL RIGHT A TEACHER PAY THE

01:58:35.608 --> 01:58:36.642
NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.978
CLASSROOM. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.746
FACTORS THAT CERTAINLY AFFECT

01:58:40.813 --> 01:58:43.282
TEACHERS. AND IF WE REDUCE CLASS

01:58:43.349 --> 01:58:45.885
SIZE WE KNOW WOULD PROBABLY HAVE

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.087
BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES AS WELL

01:58:48.154 --> 01:58:50.423
PROBABLY HAVE- HIGHER- TEACHER

01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:52.692
SATISFACTION WITH SMALLER LASS

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.594
SIZE YOU KNOW I IF WE LOOK BACK

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:56.829
EAST I'VE HEARD OF CLASSES YOU

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:58.397
KNOW OUT IN THE STATE OF

01:58:58.464 --> 01:58:59.699
CONNECTICUT WHERE THEY MAYBE

01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:01.234
HAVE. TWENTY STUDENTS PER

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.569
TEACHER AND- I'M SURE THERE

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.605
TEACHERS PROBABLY STAY LONGER

01:59:05.671 --> 01:59:08.808
BUT THE AND PAY YOU KNOW I DO

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.743
NOT WANNA DIMINISH- HOW

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:12.979
IMPORTANT TEACHER PAY IS WELL I

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:15.014
WHEN I WAS A TEACHER CAME HERE

01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:17.016
JOINT PROBABLY TWENTY THOUSAND

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.584
TEACHERS AND WE- ARE RIGHT HERE

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.520
IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. AND

01:59:20.586 --> 01:59:23.389
MARCHED HERE OF FOR INCREASED

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.790
TEACHER PAY AND WE GOT IT THAT

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:26.826
YEAR. AND FOR THE NEXT THREE

01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:27.927
YEARS THAT YOU KNOW TEACHER PAY

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.662
WENT UP BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:32.298
ONLY FACTORS THAT AFFECT A

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:35.234
TEACHER SATISFACTION AND THE ONE

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:38.738
FACTOR THAT I WANTED TO ADD- IS

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.740
NOT TANGIBLE LIKE THAT. LIKE

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:42.775
THOSE YOU KNOW TO CLASS SIZE OR

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.977
TEACHER PAY AND THAT IS TEACHER

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:47.213
EMPOWERMENT THAT HAVE TEACHERS

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.916
FELT EMPOWERED IN THEIR SCHOOLS

01:59:49.982 --> 01:59:51.984
IN THEIR CLASSROOM. THEY THEY

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:53.553
WOULD STAY LONGER AND THAT DOES

01:59:53.619 --> 01:59:55.888
GO TO YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:58.324
BETWEEN. THEM AND THEIR-

01:59:58.391 --> 02:00:02.061
ADMINISTRATORS- IT THAT GOES TO

02:00:02.128 --> 02:00:04.897
PREPARATION- IN SERVICE BUT IT

02:00:04.964 --> 02:00:07.934
TEACHERS FELT MORE EMPOWERED I

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.236
THINK THAT WOULD DO A LOT TO-

02:00:10.303 --> 02:00:12.405
TEACHER SATISFACTION JUST WANTED

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:15.975
THAT THAT. STRUCTURE OKAY. THANK

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:20.546
YOU. CHARMING MCCARTY YES MARK

02:00:20.613 --> 02:00:22.748
LAUDI MARTINA WITH THE UC- YEAH

02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:24.517
I JUST WANTED TO I WOULD BE

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:25.751
REMISS IF I DIDN'T COMMENT ON

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:27.653
THAT POINT IN PARTICULAR AND

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.923
RETENTION- BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:32.258
O'DONNELL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:34.560
MEDINA MAKE GREAT POINTS ABOUT

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:36.462
THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:38.731
PRACTICING TEACHERS BEING ARMED

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:39.732
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:42.234
NOT. ANY MORE IMPORTANT PROBABLY

02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:44.070
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER DO YOU

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:45.771
TO WHAT TEACHERS HAVE BEEN- FACE

02:00:45.838 --> 02:00:47.540
WITH A STRUGGLING WITH THIS PAST

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:49.575
COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO I JUST

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:50.910
WANTED TO- MENTIONED THE

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:52.345
IMPORTANCE OF THE INVESTMENTS

02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:53.846
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:54.480
CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:56.749
PROJECT WHICH IS THE STATE'S

02:00:56.816 --> 02:00:58.517
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NETWORK

02:00:58.584 --> 02:01:00.086
IN INTERSEGMENT ALL PROGRAMS

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.020
THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:01.921
CALIFORNIA ADMINISTERS IN

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:04.023
PARTNERSHIP WITH CSU AND THE

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:04.824
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:07.026
UNIVERSITIES IT'S DISCIPLINE

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:09.395
SPECIFICS ACROSS ALL NINE-

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:12.331
DISCIPLINES- IN THE STATE AND-

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:14.066
IT SERVES OVER THIRTY THOUSAND

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:16.435
TEACHERS. A YEAR PROBABLY OR NEW

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:18.104
DATA WILL SHOW MORE BECAUSE

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:19.872
WE'VE GONE TO PROVIDING

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:21.474
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WITH THESE

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:24.076
INVESTMENTS ONLINE EXPANDING

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.112
INTO- UNDERSERVED AREAS I THINK

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.980
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:30.583
THAT THESE FUNDS THAT- THESE NEW

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:32.218
THIS NEW INFUSION OF FUNDING IT

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:34.887
IS ONE TIME STATE FUNDS THAT AND

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:36.956
IN SOME CASES FEDERAL FUNDS-

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:39.425
THAT THAT WILL EXPIRE AND SO WE

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:42.728
AREN'T ABLE TO CREATE THE KINDS

02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:44.463
OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND- IN

02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:46.565
UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:47.767
AND WITH UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS TO

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.702
THE EXTENT THAT WOULD LIKE TO.

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:52.605
PERMANENTLY ON ONGOING BASIS BUT

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:55.074
THESE SERVICES HAVE BEEN I THINK

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:58.110
CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING TEACHERS-

02:01:58.177 --> 02:02:00.546
WHO HAVE HAD TO PET IT AND LEARN

02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:02.815
NEW STRATEGIES AND OUR NEW AND

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:05.284
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS- SO THIS IS

02:02:05.351 --> 02:02:06.585
A PIECE OF THE PROGRAM THE

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:07.853
SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT PROGRAMS

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.522
ARE THE ONES WHERE THERE IS A

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:11.223
DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.559
UNIVERSITIES BETWEEN OUR K.

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:14.760
TWELVE DISTRICTS AND PARTNERS

02:02:14.827 --> 02:02:20.833
AND. TEACHERS ON THE GROUND

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.868
EVERY DAY A YOUR ALL YOUR ROUND

02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:24.770
- SO JUST I'M- A WANTED TO RAISE

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.639
THAT BECAUSE THAT. WE HAVE

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:27.406
BENEFITTED. THOSE THE INVEST AND

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:29.408
WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE ARE-

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:31.711
PROVIDED A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:34.380
TEACHERS ON AT THIS VERY

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:37.783
CRITICAL TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:40.686
THANK YOU I KNOW THE NEXT ISSUE

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:42.655
IS FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:43.856
PROPOSALS AND ONE IS THE

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:45.758
INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAM

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:48.027
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:49.762
OVERALL COMPENSATION IT IT'S NOT

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:51.497
COMPLICATED THAT IF YOU GO TO

02:02:51.564 --> 02:02:53.466
SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS TO GET A

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.601
DEGREE YOU CAN GO GET A CAREER

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:56.736
AND LOOK AT THE AVERAGE SALARY

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:58.370
FOR THAT. YOU CAN GO GET A

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:01.040
TEACHING JOB WHICH WILL BE LESS

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:03.476
THAN THE AVERAGE SALARY YOU HAVE

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:04.577
TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR ONE MORE

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:07.413
YEAR YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID FOR

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.482
THAT YEAR AND YET MORE DEBT SO.

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:11.450
THAT I THINK IS A FACTOR WE

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.785
CAN'T IGNORE AS WELL AND SO. I

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:14.587
KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:15.688
NEXT. BUT BUT I KNOW WE DIDN'T

02:03:15.755 --> 02:03:17.890
HAVE ANYBODY HERE FROM. THE

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:19.759
SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM C-SPAN NEED

02:03:19.825 --> 02:03:21.727
FOR- ACCELERATE THROUGH THE

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:24.764
MANAGEMENT SIDE. AND I WONDER- I

02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:27.032
KNOW THERE WAS SOME REPORTS AND-

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:29.201
SOME. SOME EDUCATION

02:03:29.268 --> 02:03:31.170
PUBLICATIONS LAST WEEK TALKING

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:33.038
ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING ALL THIS.

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:34.940
PROGRAMS AND GRANTS STOP BUT

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:37.610
THAT DOESN'T REALLY. ON ON THE

02:03:37.676 --> 02:03:39.145
GROUND THESE DISTRICTS IS THAT

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:42.214
MAKING MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE SO

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:45.651
THE C. T. O. R. FINANCE RALLY-

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.686
HAVE ANY INSIGHTS AS FAR AS-

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:51.257
WHAT DID THAT. WHAT DOES THE-

02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:52.758
THE FIELD OUT THERE SCHOOL

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:54.627
DISTRICTS SCHOOL BOARDS YOU KNOW

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.462
TEACHES THAT WHAT WHAT IT WHAT

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:57.797
DID THEY SAY IS MOST NEEDED TO

02:03:57.863 --> 02:04:00.900
HELP ADDRESS THIS. RETENTION

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.334
RECRUITMENT TEACHER SHORTAGE

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:06.305
ISSUE. I'M IF I CAN SPEAK TO THE

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:08.140
RETENTION ISSUE A LITTLE BIT I

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:09.742
AGREE WITH THE PANELISTS THAT

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:10.776
SAID IT I THINK WE NEED

02:04:10.843 --> 02:04:12.411
INVESTMENTS IN BOTH RECRUITMENT

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:14.914
AND RETENTION AND WON- PROGRAM

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:16.749
THAT'S ACTUALLY RAN THROUGH OUR

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:18.284
OFFICE IS THE NATIONAL BOARD-

02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:19.852
INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WENT

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.921
THROUGH LAST YEAR AT THE TWO

02:04:21.987 --> 02:04:22.721
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.990
DOLLARS- INVESTMENT. AND WE'RE

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:27.760
JUST REALLY EXCITED TO REPORT-

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:30.162
THAT WE HAD OVER TWO THOUSAND

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:32.031
APPLICANTS FOR THE SUBSIDY WHICH

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.933
MEANS- TWO THOUSAND MORE

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.634
NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHER

02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:37.770
IS IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER

02:04:37.837 --> 02:04:39.772
APPROXIMATELY I THINK TWENTY

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:40.573
FOUR HUNDRED FOR THE INCENTIVES

02:04:40.639 --> 02:04:41.774
SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:45.144
NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED- THAT

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:45.878
WILL GET FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:48.581
FOR FIVE YEARS- THAT BEING SAID

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:51.417
I THINK MANY OF US TEACHERS-

02:04:51.483 --> 02:04:53.586
ENTER THE PROFESSION OF COURSE I

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:55.554
ENTERED IT I THINK TWENTY EIGHT

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:57.623
THOUSAND A YEAR AND I WAS PART

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.792
OF THE GROUP THAT GOT THE BUMP

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:00.693
THAT UP TO THIRTY TWO AND THEN

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.328
THIRTY FOUR WHICH WAS REALLY

02:05:02.394 --> 02:05:03.863
EXCITING. I AM BUT I WAS ALREADY

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:05.431
IN RIGHT I WAS HOOKED IT WE

02:05:05.497 --> 02:05:07.566
DON'T DO IT FOR THE MONEY IT IS

02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:09.568
A CALLING AND I'M NOT SAYING I

02:05:09.635 --> 02:05:10.870
DON'T WANT MY BY FELLOW TEACHERS

02:05:10.936 --> 02:05:12.471
OUT THERE TO GET- RAISES THEY

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:13.939
CERTAINLY CERTAINLY DESERVE IT-

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:17.276
AFTER THESE. TOUGH YEARS- BUT

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:18.878
MANY OF US WERE MORE SEEKING

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:22.281
ADDITIONAL- SALARY ARE ONLY

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:24.550
OPTION WE SEE IS TO GO BECOME

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:25.684
ADMINISTRATORS WHICH IS EXACTLY

02:05:25.751 --> 02:05:27.519
WHAT I DID GOT MY ADMINISTRATIVE

02:05:27.586 --> 02:05:28.687
CREDENTIAL KNEW THAT THAT WAS

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:31.023
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT AND THEN

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:31.790
WE LOSE THOSE REALLY GOOD

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:34.293
TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOMS TO GO

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.661
BECOME ADMINISTRATORS WHICH WE

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:36.996
ALSO NEED REALLY GOOD

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:39.064
ADMINISTRATORS RIGHT- BUT

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:41.800

CITY AND LIVING COSTS IS

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:46.765
DIFFERENT TO THE CITY I COME

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:48.300
FROM A CITY OF IRVINE IN ORANGE

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:55.074
COUNTY. IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE-

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:59.511
AT THE GASOLINE PUMP- OKAY LEARN

AMONG OTHER FOOD PRICES- HOUSING

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:21.600
COSTS OF OUR CD AT THE MINIMUM

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:25.204
ONE BEDROOM WOULD BE- OVER

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.904
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:28.307
BUT OUR BALLPARK MONTH TO START

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:31.377

TEACHERS- AVERAGES SALARY IS A

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:39.018

HIGHER COST OF LIVING WE'D SO WE

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.940

KIND OF FORMULA WHEN IT WAS

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.436
CLASSIFIED AS A RURAL AREA NOT

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:05.671
ALWAYS HAVE TOLD A DIFFERENT

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:07.606

UNDERSTAND THAT THE PIE IS TO

THEREFORE LIKE THAT- LA SQUID

02:09:30.762 --> 02:09:32.231
WOULD FIGHT TO DEATH- AND WOULD

02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:34.500
NOT ALLOW DESSEL. IT HAS BEEN

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:36.702
AVERAGE ABOUT THE HUNDRED

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:39.071

YOU KNOW FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.491
SO THEY BEEN COMPENSATING BUT

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:02.928

THAT ALREADY DO THIS WORK ATHER

02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:48.593
THAN CTC FORGET SINCE BOTH CD

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:49.861
AND THE CENTRE ON TEACHING

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:51.563

WHAT ESSENTIALLY DUPLICATE

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.846
EXISTING EFFORTS RATHER THAN

GUIDE THEM THROUGH A RATHER

02:18:14.653 --> 02:18:16.187
COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ALSO THINK

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:17.989
THAT C. D. E. OR THE CENTER

02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.424

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.535

RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:45.750
REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL. THE

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.652
DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO

RETENTION GREAT AND SUPPLY OF

02:19:07.439 --> 02:19:09.374
HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS. WE

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:10.909
ALSO BELIEVE THAT P. MATS COULD

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:13.311
HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:14.412
IF THE DISTRICT'S CURRENT

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.914

WHICH PAYMENTS ARE UNLIKELY TO

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:20.985
CHANGE. WE ALSO THINK THE

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.320
LEGISLATURE SHOULD REJECT THE

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:24.222

CREDENTIALING FEE WAIVERS WE

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.425
THINK THESE WAIVERS ARE UNLIKELY

02:19:27.492 --> 02:19:28.993
TO ATTRACT MORE TEACHERS TO THE

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.161

CURRENT TEACHER SHORTAGES

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.331
ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST TEACHERS

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:34.933
DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THESE WAIVERS

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:36.868

THAT MR O'DONNELL. ASKED ME TO-

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.810

02:32:03.013 --> 02:32:05.049
FOUR YEAR PROGRAM DESIGN FROM

02:32:05.115 --> 02:32:06.750
THE TRADITIONAL FIVE YEAR DESIGN

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.586
. YOU KNOW WE THERE'S SOME MONEY

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:09.620
FOR ADDITIONAL PLANNING OF

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:10.888
COURSE WE STARTED THIS A FEW

02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:13.390
YEARS AGO- THE QUESTION HE HAS

02:32:13.457 --> 02:32:16.460
IS THAT. WHY I HAPPEN TO BE

02:32:16.527 --> 02:32:19.663
RECEIVE MORE PRODUCT OUT OF THIS

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:20.898
AND WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:28.239
ABOUT PLANNING. SO AS THESE

02:32:28.305 --> 02:32:29.507
PROGRAMS TAKE SOME TIME TO

02:32:29.573 --> 02:32:31.642
DEVELOP- WHY HAVEN'T WE SEEN

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:32.743
MORE PRODUCT IS AN INTERESTING

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:34.645
QUESTION I SUPPOSE IT IS THAT

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:36.146
GOES TO THE CHOICES. THAT

02:32:36.213 --> 02:32:37.781
UNDERGRADUATE TEACHERS ARE

02:32:37.848 --> 02:32:39.316
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE

02:32:39.383 --> 02:32:41.051
ABOUT WHAT CAREER PATHWAYS THEY

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:43.287
MIGHT LACK. LET ME REPHRASE THAT

02:32:43.354 --> 02:32:45.222
SO I THINK THIS WAS CREATED

02:32:45.289 --> 02:32:46.790
YEARS AGO SUSAN BUT HE HAD A

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:49.627
BILL AUTHORIZING THIS AND SOME

02:32:49.693 --> 02:32:51.862
PILOTS AND WE STARTED THIS. AND

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:52.630
WE'VE BEEN. IN THE PLANNING

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:55.533
STAGES SO WHAT IS IT THAT THAT

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:57.902
WE NEED TO DO TO REALLY MAKE

02:32:57.968 --> 02:33:01.338
THESE A REALITY AND NOT JUST. IF

CAMPUSES MONEY TO PLAN FOR IT I

02:33:03.707 --> 02:33:05.876
THINK. IT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT

02:33:05.943 --> 02:33:08.145
CAN'T BE REPLICATED. WE'VE SEEN

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.747
SOME FOR YOUR KIDS COLLEGES HAVE

02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:11.715

ON MOVE IT AND HELP STUDENTS

02:33:13.484 --> 02:33:15.853

ONE INSTITUTIONS THAT LEAD TO

02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:53.924
THE UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAYS-

02:33:53.991 --> 02:33:56.260
EIGHT. WE DO WE DO HAVE I THINK

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:57.728
A VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY IN

02:33:57.795 --> 02:33:59.697
FRONT OF US AS WE LOOK AT EARLY

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:00.798
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN THE

02:34:00.864 --> 02:34:02.199
MOVEMENT TOWARD TRANSITIONAL

02:34:02.266 --> 02:34:04.802
KINDERGARTEN OF THE WE'RE

02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:05.970
LOOKING TO PROBABLY BRING

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:08.138
ANOTHER ELEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:10.441
INTO THE SYSTEM OF WHO WILL BE

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:11.809
WORKING IN THAT TRANSITIONAL

02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:13.811
KERR KINDERGARTEN SPACE AND THE

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:15.779
UNDERGRADUATE INTEGRATED PROGRAM

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:18.182
ROUTE- IS IDEALLY SUITED FOR

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.883
MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE BEGUN

02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:20.818
THEIR WORK WITH THE TWO YEAR

02:34:20.884 --> 02:34:23.053
PROGRAM- AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.822

INTO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION.

02:34:26.657 --> 02:34:28.158
AND IF WE CAN CREATE THESE

02:34:28.225 --> 02:34:29.893
PROGRAM PATHWAYS FOR THEM THAT

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.595
WOULD BE A READY- AND I THINK A

02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:33.263
VERY EFFICIENT PATHWAY FOR

02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:34.164
BRINGING THE EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:34:34.231 --> 02:34:36.634
WORKFORCE IN THAT BUT WE NEED TO

02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:39.703
BRING IN- SO BEYOND THAT I THINK

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:41.772
THAT THE MOST OF THE TEACHERS

02:34:41.839 --> 02:34:43.474

OF THAT INCREASE TO THE FEE

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:32.649
WAIVER BUT I DO THINK IT WAS

02:36:32.716 --> 02:36:34.985
PART OF A MULTI PRONG- APPROACH

02:36:35.052 --> 02:36:38.555
THAT THE- GOVERNOR- PUT FORWARD

TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND SO I

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:44.595
DO THINK THAT IT DID INCENTIVIZE

02:36:44.661 --> 02:36:47.431

IN AS WELL- I THINK IT'S

02:37:05.849 --> 02:37:07.484
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT WAS

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:09.453
THE FIRST YEAR OF THE FEE WAIVER

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.088
AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES

02:37:11.155 --> 02:37:13.724
INCLUDE SOME- INVESTMENTS AND

02:37:13.791 --> 02:37:15.325

INTEGRATED PROGRAM. THAT IS

02:41:54.571 --> 02:41:56.239
CERTAINLY A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO

02:41:56.306 --> 02:41:57.808
THE STUDENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE

02:41:57.874 --> 02:41:58.842

HERE BUT- YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON TO

03:07:38.013 --> 03:07:39.414
OTHER STUFF. I'M I THINK THE ONE

03:07:39.481 --> 03:07:41.717
ISSUE THAT THAT WE ARE CONVINCED

03:07:41.783 --> 03:07:44.152
APPEAR ON THE BODY AT.

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:46.788
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TWO. CD

03:07:46.855 --> 03:07:48.724
PROGRAM HAS A GREAT LOVE FOR C.

03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:51.593
T. AND WE'RE NOT CERTAIN WHY WE

03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:53.762
HAVE TO PROGRAM SO. AND MR

03:07:53.829 --> 03:07:55.364
DONNELLY STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS

03:07:55.430 --> 03:07:58.467
AND PENDING LEGISLATION AGAIN.

03:07:58.533 --> 03:08:00.502
WE HAVE HEARD FROM LA- WHAT WE

03:08:00.569 --> 03:08:01.770
THINK ABOUT THE STRONG WORK

03:08:01.837 --> 03:08:04.640
FORCE PROGRAM. AND THE PROGRAM

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:07.542
CDP WHICH WE- STRONGLY SUPPORT

03:08:07.609 --> 03:08:10.445
AND DOUBLE OUR STATE SUPPORT FOR

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:13.015
LAST YEAR AND HAS ON GOING DOWN

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:15.817
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN PLANNING

03:08:15.884 --> 03:08:17.452
MAKE AN ONGOING. PRIORITY DOES

03:08:17.519 --> 03:08:19.354
IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE TWO

03:08:19.421 --> 03:08:21.089
PROGRAMS WE CONSOLIDATED INTO

03:08:21.156 --> 03:08:24.559
ONE. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE. FROM A

03:08:24.626 --> 03:08:26.028
RECORD BROUGHT THE LEADS WE

03:08:26.094 --> 03:08:27.596

ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION- ON

03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:31.700
THIS ISSUE AND THEY DO THE

03:08:31.767 --> 03:08:32.634
PROGRAMS DO SIR SLIGHTLY

03:08:32.701 --> 03:08:35.404
DIFFERENT- GOLD HERE SO I THINK

03:08:35.470 --> 03:08:37.906
PART OF THE ISSUE IS YOU KNOW TO

03:08:37.973 --> 03:08:39.808
WHAT LEVEL OF- YOU KNOW AND

03:08:39.875 --> 03:08:41.476
INFINITE. PUBLIC ON BOTH THE

03:08:41.543 --> 03:08:42.244
MINERAL DUNFORD DOUBLES

03:08:42.310 --> 03:08:43.779
PREFERENCE FOR THIS THE TECH

03:08:43.845 --> 03:08:44.713
PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES MORE

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.581
FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:47.582
IN TERMS OF DESIGNING THAT

03:08:47.649 --> 03:08:49.284
PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE. THEY HAVE TO

03:08:49.351 --> 03:08:50.952
BE VERY SPECIFICALLY ALIGNED TO

03:08:51.019 --> 03:08:52.421
THE I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A

03:08:52.487 --> 03:08:54.589
RECCO YOU DON'T HAVE ONE FOR US

03:08:54.656 --> 03:08:55.757
TODAY BUT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

03:08:55.824 --> 03:08:57.192
CONTINUE GOING FORWARD IN.

03:08:57.259 --> 03:08:59.461
CALIFORNIA YOUR EDGAR KING FOR

03:08:59.528 --> 03:09:01.563
THE DAY IN CITY. WOULD YOU HAVE

03:09:01.630 --> 03:09:03.899
TO COMPANION THINGS ARE. FOCUSED

03:09:03.965 --> 03:09:07.502
ON. ON ONE PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN

03:09:07.569 --> 03:09:11.506
MAXIMIZE. WITH REGARD TO GET

03:09:11.573 --> 03:09:12.507
DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU THINK

03:09:12.574 --> 03:09:14.509
THAT THESE. CALLS ARE CLEAR BUT

03:09:14.576 --> 03:09:15.677
YOU'RE CLEARLY GETTING DIFFERENT

03:09:15.744 --> 03:09:16.712
THINGS FROM BOTH PROGRAMS THAT

03:09:16.778 --> 03:09:18.547
YOU LIKE- AND IF YOU DO THEM

03:09:18.613 --> 03:09:19.815
THAT MAYBE THERE'S A REASON TO

03:09:19.881 --> 03:09:21.783
HAVE THEM SEPARATE BUT- IF THE

03:09:21.850 --> 03:09:24.152
PROGRAMS ARE. ESSENTIALLY

03:09:24.219 --> 03:09:24.786
SERVING FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU FIND

03:09:24.853 --> 03:09:26.755
OUT THAT. ON THE GROUND

03:09:26.822 --> 03:09:27.723
DISTRICTS ARE USING THEM FOR

03:09:27.789 --> 03:09:29.391
SIMPLY THE FAME PROGRAM BUT THEY

03:09:29.458 --> 03:09:30.592
HAVE TO DEAL WITH DOUBLE THE

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:31.560
NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND

03:09:31.626 --> 03:09:32.761
DOUBLE THE APPLICATIONS THEN

03:09:32.828 --> 03:09:34.529
YOU'D HAVE MORE WE WOULD HAVE

03:09:34.596 --> 03:09:35.497
MORE CONCERNS. A POSITIVE FOR

03:09:35.564 --> 03:09:37.065
SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE

03:09:37.132 --> 03:09:37.632
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THAT

03:09:37.699 --> 03:09:38.867
LEVEL THE DIVIDING EVERYTHING

03:09:38.934 --> 03:09:40.469
THAT'S- OUT OF THE WAY WE WOULD

03:09:40.535 --> 03:09:42.738
THINK ABOUT- DECIDING WHETHER

03:09:42.804 --> 03:09:43.572
YOU THINK THAT. IT'S WORTH

03:09:43.638 --> 03:09:46.108
HAVING THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT I

03:09:46.174 --> 03:09:46.775
AGREED IN GENERAL AND WE'LL TALK

03:09:46.842 --> 03:09:48.343
ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GET TO THE

03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:49.911
NEXT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS

03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:50.545
IS. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA

03:09:50.612 --> 03:09:51.913
HAVE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT

03:09:51.980 --> 03:09:53.281
DISTRICTS HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT

03:09:53.348 --> 03:09:54.549
RULES AND UNDERSTAND HOW EACH OF

03:09:54.616 --> 03:09:55.751
THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS

03:09:55.817 --> 03:09:57.753
WORK. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:09:57.819 --> 03:09:58.854
THERE IS THERE IS CLARITY AND

03:09:58.920 --> 03:09:59.821
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE

03:09:59.888 --> 03:10:00.922
GETTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE

03:10:00.989 --> 03:10:02.791
AND THAT IT MAKES. THERE'S LIKE

03:10:02.858 --> 03:10:04.559
A CLEAR CLEAR CASE FOR WHY NOT

03:10:04.626 --> 03:10:06.695
WHY THAT SHOULD OCCUR. OKAY AND

03:10:06.762 --> 03:10:08.296
THEN FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:10:08.363 --> 03:10:10.465
PERSPECTIVE. WE HEARD FOR YEARS

03:10:10.532 --> 03:10:11.700
THAT THEY NEEDED ONGOING NOT

03:10:11.767 --> 03:10:12.801
JUST ONE TIME TO DO PROPER

03:10:12.868 --> 03:10:14.970
PLANNING. AND DO WE THINK THAT

03:10:15.036 --> 03:10:16.304
SINCE WE NOW HAVE HAD ONGOING

03:17:22.897 --> 03:17:24.432
PROGRAM RULES THIS CAN MAKE

03:17:24.499 --> 03:17:26.668
IMPLEMENTING WELL L. PROGRAMS A

03:17:26.734 --> 03:17:28.736
MINISTRY TO FLEE AND FISCALLY

03:17:28.803 --> 03:17:31.206
CHALLENGING FOR US SCHOOLS. OUR

03:17:31.272 --> 03:17:32.674
SECOND CONCERN IS THAT ALTHOUGH

03:17:32.740 --> 03:17:33.575
THE PROPOSAL HAS CLEAR

03:17:33.641 --> 03:17:34.976
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TYPES OF

03:17:35.043 --> 03:17:36.477
PATHWAYS THE PROGRAM GRANT

03:17:36.544 --> 03:17:38.546
RECIPIENTS MUST DEVELOP AND ALSO

03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:40.381
REQUIRES THEM TO SUBMIT OVER

03:17:40.448 --> 03:17:42.350
BLESSED OF OUTCOME DATA

03:17:42.417 --> 03:17:43.851
COLLECTION CRITICAL DETAILS AND

03:17:43.918 --> 03:17:45.920
LEAVES A FEW A KEY DECISIONS THE

03:17:45.987 --> 03:17:47.522
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC PUBLIC

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:48.523
INSTRUCTION AND THE BOARD OF

03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:51.693
EDUCATION SUCH AS- GRANT AMOUNTS

03:17:51.759 --> 03:17:52.760
AND ALLOWABLE USES OF THE

03:17:52.827 --> 03:17:54.762
FUNDING WITHOUT THESE DETAILS IT

03:17:54.829 --> 03:17:56.297
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

03:17:56.364 --> 03:18:00.935
TO ASSESS. THE PROGRAM'S

03:18:01.002 --> 03:18:01.703
POTENTIAL BENEFITS. A TO THESE.

03:18:01.769 --> 03:18:02.670
WERE RECOMMEND THE- REQUEST

03:18:02.737 --> 03:18:03.504
MINISTER PROVIDE MORE

03:18:03.571 --> 03:18:05.139
INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSALS

03:18:05.206 --> 03:18:07.642
FROM ALL. PARTS OF MY REVISION

03:18:07.709 --> 03:18:08.876
MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE

03:18:08.943 --> 03:18:10.144
HAVE HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO

03:18:10.211 --> 03:18:11.579
GENDER. A FULL LIST OF OUR

03:18:11.646 --> 03:18:14.449
QUESTIONS IS ON YOUR AGENDA

03:18:14.515 --> 03:18:15.950
STARTING ON PAGE FORTY THREE.

03:18:16.017 --> 03:18:17.685
REGARDING THE DORMER PROPOSALS

03:18:17.752 --> 03:18:19.420
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT THE

03:18:19.487 --> 03:18:21.356
MINISTRATION HAS NOT IDENTIFIED

03:18:21.422 --> 03:18:23.391
WHAT PROBLEMS CURRENTLY EXIST.

03:18:23.458 --> 03:18:25.426
WITH ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR

03:18:25.493 --> 03:18:27.228
DEMONSTRATION IS NOT SPECIFY

03:18:27.295 --> 03:18:28.229
WHAT BARRIERS LEDS CURRENTLY

03:18:28.296 --> 03:18:30.999
FAITH. AND- IMPLEMENTED TO

03:18:31.065 --> 03:18:33.568
ENROLLMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY

03:18:33.635 --> 03:18:36.504
THE CASE FOR THE- A COLLEGE AND

03:18:36.571 --> 03:18:37.872
CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS PROGRAMS

03:18:37.939 --> 03:18:39.674
BECAUSE HE KEPT PROGRAMS WHICH

03:18:39.741 --> 03:18:41.376
HAVE FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR BOTH

03:18:41.442 --> 03:18:43.144
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY

03:18:43.211 --> 03:18:45.747
COLLEGES AND THE ENROLLMENT FOR

03:18:45.813 --> 03:18:48.182
THE C. CAP PROGRAMS HAVE GROWN

03:18:48.249 --> 03:18:50.084
SUBSTANTIALLY OVER RECENT YEARS

03:18:50.151 --> 03:18:52.153
EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AGAINST

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:54.289
THE OVERALL TREND OF THE MOMENT

03:18:54.355 --> 03:18:55.456
THE CLIENT AT THE COMMUNITY

03:18:55.523 --> 03:18:57.258
COLLEGES. ON THE LAST CONCERN WE

03:18:57.325 --> 03:18:59.994
HAVE A PLACE TO BOTH OF THE

03:19:00.061 --> 03:19:00.862
PROPOSALS. ON WHAT IS THAT THEY

03:19:00.928 --> 03:19:03.097
BOTH DO LITTLE TO TARGET FUNDING

03:19:03.164 --> 03:19:03.698
TO SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS WILL

03:19:03.765 --> 03:19:05.133
BENEFIT THE MOST. THE

03:19:05.199 --> 03:19:06.534
ADMINISTRATION GIVE PRIORITY TO

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:07.702
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

03:19:07.769 --> 03:19:09.570
SCHOOLS WITH AT LEAST HALF OF

03:19:09.637 --> 03:19:10.938
THE STUDENT POPULATION

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:11.572
CONSISTING OF ENGLISH LEARNERS

03:19:11.639 --> 03:19:13.341
AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AMONG

03:19:13.408 --> 03:19:15.743
OTHER METRICS SUCH AS HAVING

03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:16.511
HIGHER THAN AVERAGE DROPOUT

03:19:16.577 --> 03:19:19.414
REEF. BUT BASED ON JUST ON THAT

03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:21.082
NUMBER OF- INVESTORS A LOCUM

03:19:21.149 --> 03:19:22.917
STUDENTS WE FIND THAT AT LEAST

03:19:22.984 --> 03:19:24.385
TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:19:24.452 --> 03:19:26.854
MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR. PRIORITY

03:19:26.921 --> 03:19:28.289
SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION IS

03:19:28.356 --> 03:19:30.358
UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON

03:19:30.425 --> 03:19:33.494
STUDENTS THAT COULD MOST BENEFIT

03:19:33.561 --> 03:19:34.462
FROM THE PROGRAM. IF THE

03:19:34.529 --> 03:19:36.064
LEGISLATURE ADOPTS A PROPOSAL WE

03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:37.332
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

03:19:37.398 --> 03:19:38.833
CONSIDER OTHER WAYS TO TARGET

03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:40.535
FUNDING TO SCHOOLS. AND STUDENTS

03:19:40.601 --> 03:19:41.969
WITH THE HIGHEST NEED. OF FOR

03:19:42.036 --> 03:19:43.538
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

03:19:43.604 --> 03:19:44.505
CONSIDER INCREASING THE

03:19:44.572 --> 03:19:45.773
THRESHOLD FOR PRIORITY FOR

03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:47.709
DISTRICTS WITH SEVENTY FIVE

03:19:47.775 --> 03:19:49.110
PERCENT. OF THEIR STUDENT

03:19:49.177 --> 03:19:51.279
POPULATION- BEING LOW COMPARING

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:53.381
MR STUDENTS. OF THE LEGISLATURE

03:19:53.448 --> 03:19:55.183
COULD ALSO REQUIRE GRANTEES TO

03:19:55.249 --> 03:19:57.685
DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY WILL BE

03:19:57.752 --> 03:19:58.252
IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS

03:19:58.319 --> 03:19:59.687
EQUITABLY ACROSS VARIOUS SCHOOLS

03:19:59.754 --> 03:20:01.789
FAITH. AND IN A WAY THAT IS

03:20:01.856 --> 03:20:03.491
TARGETED TO BENEFIT STUDENT

03:20:03.558 --> 03:20:04.826
SUBGROUPS WITH LOWER COLLEGE AND

03:20:04.892 --> 03:20:07.829

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

03:20:38.393 --> 03:20:39.961
