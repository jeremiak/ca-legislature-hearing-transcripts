INITIAL INVESTIGATION IT'S A

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:47.918

THOSE THINGS I THINK WHEN YOU

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.440

THIS RAMPANT. ON WILL NOT TOUCH

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.166
OUR MAJORITY LEADER AND SHE HAD

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.768

SHE'S HEARING FROM HER

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.270

WITHOUT A CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.189

BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WAS

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:35.011
OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE HUGE SPIKE

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:38.214
IN- CLAIMS AND OF COURSE THE NEW

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:40.216

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.180
WRONG AND WE'RE STILL IN THE

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.214
MIDDLE OF THAT THERE'S NO

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:12.649
QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT- YOU KNOW

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:19.189

TOGETHER. YOU KNOW US BOUNCING

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:26.863

SORT OF A LITTLE TOO SO WHAT

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:42.646
WERE YOUR LESSONS LEARNED TO

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.514
THIS POINT I KNOW YOU'RE STILL.

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.850
IN THE PROCESS OF- FINALIZING

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:49.152
YOUR REPORT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.920
THAT THE RECESSION PLAN WILL BE

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:54.324
IS WAS I OPENING TO ME- YOU KNOW

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.760
I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW BEING

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.495
ABLE TO HIT IT AND YOU KNOW OF

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.397
COURSE WITH THE- BEING ABLE TO

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.298
PICK IT QUICKLY. IT'S OBVIOUSLY

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.500
A LESSON THAT WE LEARNED AND WE

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:05.735
COULDN'T HAVE IT QUICKLY BACK

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.804
WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED- I

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.439
THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE I. T.

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:11.641
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND THE I.

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.810
T. SYSTEM THAT WE WILL HAVE. I

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.578
THINK THAT THAT WILL BE A HUGE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.113
DIFFERENCE IN BEING ABLE TO PAY

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.516
THAT- YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH THE

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.184
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON GUIDANCE I

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:22.919
MEAN WE'RE NOT WORK WE ARE NOT

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.421
ALL WE CAN'T ALWAYS MAKE THE

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.389
CHANGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE-

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:27.624
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.692
FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT WE HAVE TO

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:32.262
ABIDE BY. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT-

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:33.730
YOU KNOW THE RECESSION PLAN IS

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.999
SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE GONNA USE

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:40.303
AS OUR GUIDE AND BIBLE YOU KNOW

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:43.306
FOR THE NEXT RECESSION. IT IS A

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:44.441
SEPARATE FROM I. T. WHAT ELSE

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:48.078
WOULD YOU SAY- DISORGANIZATION

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:50.647

HELP YOU. PEOPLE TO PEOPLE MORE

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.118
NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE. I THINK

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.720
SOME OF OUR POLICIES SOME OF OUR

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.254
INTERNAL POLICIES I MEAN WE'RE

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.856
DEAL WELL DOES GIVE US A LITTLE

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:02.092
BIT OF THE WAY SO TO SPEAK YOU

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.727
KNOW AND LIKE THE OVERPAYMENT

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.495
AREA AND SOME WAIVERS YOU KNOW I

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.564
MEAN WHEN WE CAN DO THAT. AND WE

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.499
CAN DO THAT AND WE CAN AUTOMATE

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:12.068
THAT THEN THAT HELPS TO SPEED UP

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.403
EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN IN A

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.504
NUTSHELL I WOULD SAY THAT'S

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:16.272
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING THAT

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:17.974
WE HAVE DONE I MEAN WE ARE VERY

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.709
YOU KNOW WE ARE CLAIMANT FOCUSED

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:22.812
AT EDT AND WE ARE- ALWAYS

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.581
WILLING TO- LOOK AT THINGS A

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.750
DIFFERENT WAY- AND SO I THINK

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.418
THAT THAT HAS HELPED US OR THE

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:31.020

OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:33.957
AND I THINK THAT ON THAT HAS

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:37.393
BEEN SUPER HELPFUL AS WELL.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.461
LOOKING AT THINGS A DIFFERENT

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.697

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:18.127
I RE READ THE THIRD STRIKE TEAM

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.429
RECOMMENDATION OVER THE WEEKEND

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.897
IT ACTUALLY DROPPED FOUR DAYS

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.867
BEFORE I STARTED AYE DVD- BUT

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.301
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT PART OF IT

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:27.003
IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.404
ABOUT PEOPLE RIGHT YOU'RE

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:29.772
TALKING ABOUT THE WORKERS THAT

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.608
YOU THE AND THE MANUAL PROCESS

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:32.909
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:35.011
CULTURE FRAUD. YOU KNOW WHICH I

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.212
WHICH I IMAGINE IS ONE OF THE

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.981
REASONS WHY THEY SUGGESTED THAT

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:39.148
WE USE A VENDOR YOU KNOW THAT

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:41.117
MET THE FEDERAL STANDARD- IT

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:42.919
TAKES THE MANUAL PROCESS OUT OF

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.454
IT AND IT'S SORT OF ELIMINATES

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.456
THE FRONT CULTURE. I MEAN INTO

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:47.690
YOUR QUESTION I THINK YOU KNOW

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:48.958
WE ARE I THINK WE'RE UNDER

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.894
ESTIMATING. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.495
HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:53.897
ON YOU KNOW REGARDING THE

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:59.402
IDENTITY THEFT THAT WENT ON AND. QUITE FRANKLY CONTINUES TO GO

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:00.103
ON. ALTHOUGH EVERY PERSON I KNOW

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:01.938
HAS HAD SORT OF SCAM STEPS. TO

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.640
THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC EDT ARE

00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.375
NOT YOU KNOW OR KNEW SOMEONE

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.976
THAT DID. AND I THINK THAT

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:08.578
SAYING THAT THE FRONT IS OVER

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:11.447
NOW THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE. ANY

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:13.416
A FEDERAL PROGRAM LIKE POOL I

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.184
THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:17.387
DANGEROUS YOU KNOW- I DON'T

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.689
THINK THAT WE HAVE- WE ARE

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.658
PRIORITIZING FRAUD AT THE

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:24.160
EXPENSE OF. PROMPT AND STRAIGHT

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:26.429
FORWARD PAYMENTS I THINK FROM

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:27.864
OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.332
WOULD SAY IT'S THE OPPOSITE WE

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.600
WOULD SAY THE LESS FRAUD AND

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.669
IDENTITY THEFT THAT OCCURS. ON

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:34.737
THE FRONT END THE QUICKER WE CAN

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:38.574
GET. YOU KNOW PEOPLE KATE- YOU

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:41.010
KNOW SO I THINK THAT IT'S YOU

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:42.612
KNOW WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:44.647
AGAIN I WOULD IMAGINE IF WE HAD

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:47.150
ANOTHER FEDERAL. PROGRAM ONE

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.618
THING THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:49.752
LESSONS LEARNED AND I'M CERTAIN

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:50.954
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.889
AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ALSO.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:55.792
CHANGED SOME OF THEIR- GUIDANCE

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.193
AS YOU KNOW WE JUST TALKED ABOUT

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.062
SEIZE JUST YOU KNOW OF A FEW

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.596
MINUTES AGO. AND THAT WAS

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.698
SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN THE

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.633
FIRST PROGRAM BUT WAS IN THE

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.134
SECOND PROGRAM YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:08.204
HAVE TO SUBSTANTIATE- EUROPOL

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.074
EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW FOR FEDERAL

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.843
BENEFITS STONE. I THINK THAT-

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.178
YOU KNOW I THINK WE COULD PICK

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.646
IT I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.947
NOW THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:20.116
OUT THERE AND ORDERED AND WE CAN

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.418
GET IT. IF WE NEED TO. WE JUST

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.854
PIGGY BACKING OFF THE QUESTIONS

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.189
FROM TO MY COLLEAGUES EARLIER.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:29.359
THEN DO YOU HAVE. THE PROPER

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:32.996
STAFFING TO DO WITH- POTENTIAL

FRAUDULENT CLAIMS- AS YOU

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:39.102
DESCRIBE THIS IS- IDENTITY THEFT

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.004
IS BECOMING MORE MORE PREVALENT

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.838
NOT LAST. SO THE QUESTION IS

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:45.708
THAT IS YOUR- IS YOUR STAFFING

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.543
ADEQUATE FOR THE MOMENT

ADDITIONAL STAFFING ADEQUATE FOR

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:52.582
THE FUTURE. SO I WOULD SAY YES

THAT ARE INCLUDED- AND YOU KNOW.

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.533
THE IDEA AROUND THE FACT THAT

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.202
CALIFORNIA IS BUYING POWER WAS

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.137
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.171
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:51.607
ENTERED. INTO AN ENTERPRISE

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:54.910
CONTRACT- WITH MICROSOFT FOR

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.079
OFFICETHREE SIXTY FIVE IN

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.881
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OUR BUYING

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:02.451
POWER WAS SUPPOSED TO- TRANSLATE

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:05.388
TO COST SAVINGS. SO AND THERE

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.356
ARE MULTIPLE BCPS NOW FOR

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.591
DEPARTMENTS TO PAY FOR THEIR

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:11.394
MICROSOFT THREE SIXTY FIVE AND

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.763
THESE BCPS NOTE THAT. THEY ARE

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:16.298
TO COVER THE INCREASED COST OF

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.401
MOVING TO A STATE BY CONTRACT

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:21.237
FOR MICROSOFT AND USER LICENSING

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.439
AGREEMENT. SO ONE- DID THE

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:25.074
ENTERPRISE CONTRACT NOT

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.776
TRANSLATE TO COST SAVINGS BUT

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:32.782
ACTUALLY TO INCREASE COSTS. I AM

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.784
GOING TO HAVE TO DEFERRED TO ONE

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:35.785
OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:43.726
QUESTION. BUT AFTERNOON I READ I

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.195
GOT ET US DEFENSE FOR MAKING

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:49.865
OFFICER SO BEFORE. CURRENTLY ET

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:52.635
DE MICROSOFT LICESING IS BASED

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:56.505
ON A PER USAGE- FIVE INSTEAD OF

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.341
AN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SO-

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:03.145
PDD LAST- UPGRADED THEIR

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:06.782
SOFTWARE WAY BACK IN TWENTY

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.384
FOURTEEN I BELIEVE ARE TWENTY

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:09.518
THIRTEEN WHEN I WENT WHEN THERE

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.388
WAS FUNDING AVAILABLE SO THERE

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:13.889
WAS NOT A CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.991
MICROSOFT LICENSING THE REASON

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.960
FOR THE REQUEST IS NOW. WE'RE

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.995
GONNA HAVE A CONTINUOUS-

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:23.999
SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES FOR OFFICE

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.167
THREE SIXTY FIVE. RIGHT BUT BUT

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.936
AGAIN THE QUESTION IS THAT IT

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:29.371
WAS MANT TO. BRING ABOUT COST

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:33.709
SAVINGS- BUT BUT BUT THIS IS

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.744
THIS IS INCREASING I UNDERSTAND

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:36.645
THE NUMBER OF USERS THE NUMBER

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.280
OF YEARS IT WILL BE DOING

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:39.081
BUSINESS WITH THE STATE OF

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.150
CALIFORNIA IS A PHENOMENAL

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:44.186
OPPORTUNITY. AND ITS ADVANTAGES

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:45.254
TO ANYONE WHO IS GOING TO BE

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:48.123
ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION. TO

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.125
RECEIVE THE ENTIRETY OF THE

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:51.927
BUSINESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.629
WE'RE INSURING THAT WE'RE

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.432
PROTECTING THE STATE'S. ASSETS

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.868
BY NEGOTIATING THE BEST DEAL

01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:02.705
POSSIBLE FOR US. SO YEAH THERE

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:03.506
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A COST

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.307
SAVINGS IF YOU COULD WORTH INTO

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.576
AN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT BEFORE

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.278
COMING INTO YOU THINK THAT THE

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.113
TDP'S CONTRACT- THE REASON WHY

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.448
WE DON'T HAVE A COST SAVINGS

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.049
BECAUSE HE WAS NEVER IN AN

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.050
ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT YOU WITH

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.219
WHEN. THERE WAS MONEY AVAILABLE

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.787
AND WE BY THE LICENSE DENNIS AT

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:21.023
THAT TIME WHICH WAS AVAILABLE

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.424
FOR UP WHAT ENTERPRISE UP THIRTY

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.093
FEET LICENSING WITH AVAILABLE

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.694
WAY BACK WHICH IS CURRENTLY NOT

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.596
NOT AVAILABLE FOR OFFICE THREE

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.998
SIXTY FIVE. SO THAT'S THE REASON

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.399
WHY HE DOES NOT HAVE A COST

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.301
SAVINGS JUST BECAUSE OUR MODEL

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.969
WITH DIFFERENT COMPARED TO THE

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.938
MODEL TODAY SO THEN DOESN'T THIS

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.574
REQUIRE OR ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.843
FOR US TO. REVISIT AND OPEN IT

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.178
UP. TO SEE WHAT OTHER PROPOSALS

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.381
THAT MEET THEIR MAYBE. WHY NOT

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:48.551
WHY NOW GO FORWARD WITH- WITH

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.219
INCURRING A GREATER AMOUNT OF

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.388
COST. BUT INSTEAD SEE WHAT

01:09:52.454 --> 01:09:53.889
TECHNOLOGY IS SPECIALLY GIVEN

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.658
HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY FLOOD

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.093
CHANGES. IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.299
OF TIME. WHY NOT NOW OPEN IT UP

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.833
AGAIN. SO WE ARE YOU THINK

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:05.734
TICKET OF POP UP. THAT WOULD SET

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:08.203
UP. RECENTLY OF TO FILL DIDN'T

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.140
DO THE- AT ECONOMICS OF SCALE SO

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:13.475
THAT IS THE BEST AFTER ABOUT-

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:16.412
OF- COSTING RIGHT NOW FOR THE

SAYING KATAKANA MEANS OF SCALE.

WE'RE PAYING MORE. AND THAT'S

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.852
EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT IF WE'RE

GOING TO UTILIZE ECONOMIES OF

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.056
SCALE CAR ADVANTAGE. WE

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:29.425

GREEN JOBS OF SCALE AND SO IT'S

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.776
A LARGER CONVERSATION THAT THE

02:01:23.843 --> 02:01:25.511
LEGISLATURE DID SEVERAL OF US

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:26.746
ARE HAVING WITH THE TRADES AS

02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:28.881
WELL. AND SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:30.416
THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:32.652
ESTIMATES ABOUT HOW MANY

02:01:32.718 --> 02:01:35.054
DISPLACED OIL AND GAS WORKERS

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:37.657
WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR EDT AND CW

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:40.693
TV PROGRAMS. HOW WERE THE AMOUNT

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.329
OF FIFTY MILLION FOR EDT AND THE

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:46.032
FIFTEEN MILLION FIFTEEN MILLION

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:51.470
FOR CWD BE DEVELOPED. THAT'S A

02:01:51.537 --> 02:01:53.506
GREAT QUESTION I MAKE MAYBE I

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:54.807
COULD START MANAGER IF I IF

02:01:54.874 --> 02:01:59.345
THAT'S OKAY- PLEASE GO AHEAD.

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.913
FOUR WE LOOK AT DATA ON THE

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.081
NUMBER OF WHEN THE GAS

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.416
EXTRACTION WORKERS IN KERN

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:05.317
COUNTY ALONE- IN IT IT NUMBERS

02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:07.153
BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TWO

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:10.289
THOUSAND WORKERS- AND THE-

02:02:10.356 --> 02:02:12.191
BOILING CAP. I'M SORRY THE OIL

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:14.160
AND GAS- ORPHAN WELL CAPPING

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:16.962
PILOT- IT'S ENOUGH TO TARGET

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:19.231
FIFTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS- BUT I

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:20.066
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:22.902
OUT THAT. WITH THE INVESTMENT OF

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:24.370
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:02:24.437 --> 02:02:26.539
FROM CONSERVATION- IT IT'LL

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:29.608
DRIVE DEMAND FOR WORKERS IN IN

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:31.544
THAT SUB SECTOR BOB. READ PRETTY

02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:33.746
DRAMATICALLY- IN ADDITION TO THE

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:35.481
FEDERAL INVESTMENT SO FAR IN THE

02:02:35.548 --> 02:02:37.349
PCP FOR CONSERVATION FOR THE TWO

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:38.451
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

02:02:38.517 --> 02:02:41.220
WHILE CAPPING. THE ESTIMATE-

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:43.255
THAT THE CREATION OF EIGHT

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:45.825
THOUSAND JOBS- THREE THOUSAND OF

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:47.293
THOSE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:51.030
OF THOSE WOULD BE DIRECT JOBS-

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:53.132
SO WE SEE THAT THERE'S- THREE-

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.301
SIGNIFICANT DEMAND. FOR JOBS SO

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.368
WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:58.037
TRINITY IN A PART OF CALIFORNIA

02:02:58.104 --> 02:03:00.473
THAT REALLY NEEDS- THESE GOOD

02:03:00.539 --> 02:03:02.441
QUALITY JOBS- TO BUILD A PATH

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:04.577
WHICH TO THEM- THE THESE ARE

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:07.046
HIGHLY SKILLED- AT LEAST IN THE

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.280
IN THE WELL CAPPING WORK THAT

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:10.082
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- CAPPING

02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:11.984
OF THE- ORPHAN OIL WELLS. IT'S

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:13.052
HIGHLY SKILLED WELL COMPENSATED

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:16.055
WORK- THE WAGE RATES ARE FROM

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:17.189
EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TWO

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.390
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AN

02:03:18.457 --> 02:03:21.727
HOUR- AND- YEAH. SO I THINK

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:23.362
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT DEMAND THE

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:28.601

FOLLOWING UP ON THAT PARTICULAR

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.207
ISSUE THE IDEA OF MOVING WORKERS

THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WHERE

02:03:40.312 --> 02:03:41.881
THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE

02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:43.749
RETIREMENT BENEFITS. NOT

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:46.786
INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. AND 23%

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:49.188
ARE UNIONIZED. MOVING THEM TO

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:50.723
STATE SPONSORED GREEN ENERGY

JOBS. THAT HAVE LOWER AVERAGE

02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:55.494
SALARIES AND LOWER RATES OF

UNIONIZATION. WAS NOTHING SHORT

02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:01.467
OF NOT REAL. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:04.136
HAVE INDICATED THE AN EQUITABLE

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:06.205
RELIEF PROGRAM WOULD BE MORE IN

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:08.107

WORKERS WHAT ADDITIONALLY

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:16.048
REQUIRE THE STATE TO INVEST AS

PANDEMIC IN RECENT YEARS- BUT IT

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:13.672
COULD PROVE HELPFUL IN THE LONG

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:15.140

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:16.308
QUESTIONS WORK FOR THIS COMPANY

BOTTLENECK FOR THAT SHORTAGE-

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:36.628
BECAUSE THE FIRST WORKFORCE
