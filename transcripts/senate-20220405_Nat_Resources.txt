DESERTED WELLS ARE YOU FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO THE STATE AND DANGEROUS TO THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT AND RESIDENTS. THE WEALTH CAN LEAK IT DEGRADING AIR QUALITY AND CONTAMINATE AQUIFER'S HARMING THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO A REUTERS INVESTIGATION ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS IN THE UNITED STATES WERE COLLECTIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR EMITTING TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE. THOUSAND TONS OF METHANE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE SEEN THE REAL IMPACT. OF THESE OIL COMPANIES GOING BANKRUPT AND LEAVING TAXPAYERS TO PAY THE PRICE OF CLEANING UP AGING OIL INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS THE CENTRAL FOR THE STATE TO HAVE FUNDS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE MASSIVE NEED FOR FUNDING FOR PLUGGING AND ABANDONING THESE ORPHANED WELLS. AND ENSURING INDUSTRY IS ALSO PART OF THE SOLUTION AND PLAYS A PART IN PLUGGING AND ABANDONING THESE WELLS. SB TWELVE NINETY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THAT WHEN MONEY IS ALLOCATED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY FOR PLUGGING AND ABANDONING. CAL CHEN CAN COLLECT AND SPEND THAT SAME AMOUNT FROM INDUSTRY. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW CALTRAIN TO SAVE UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION. IF THEY DO NOT SPEND THEIR FULL ANNUAL ALLOCATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITION ON THIS ISSUE AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO FIND WAYS. IS SOLUTION ADDING ALLUSION THAT CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS WHILE ALSO PROTECTING TAXPAYERS. TODAY WE HAVE. AN ALEXANDER FROM THE NATIONAL RESOURCE DEFENSE COUNCIL AND MELISSA ROMERO FROM CAMP CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL. VOTERS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

MISTER CHAIR NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP. OKAY THANK YOU- SEEING NO SUPPORT IN OUR HEARING ROOM AT THIS POINT- WILL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION TESTIMONY MISTER- WELL IN TIME IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY ONE TIME. PLEASE A YOU'VE GOT. TO GET THREE MINUTES RIGHT GERMAN PERSON ONE TIME FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ALL THIS BILL ENDS THE PRACTICE OF CAL JIM CREDITING PRODUCERS THEIR UNSPENT FEES FOR THE REMEDIATION OF ORPHAN WELLS ANNUALLY IF THE BALANCE OF FUNDS- PRODUCERS DEPOSIT INTO THE O. G. G. A. F. IS NOT REFUNDED TO PRODUCERS ANNUALLY CAL JIM HAS NO INCENTIVE TO SPEND THE FULL AMOUNT EACH YEAR. WE BELIEVE PRODUCER SHOULD BE CREDITED YEAR OVER YEAR FOR FUNDS NOT SPENT ANNUALLY PLUGGING- ORPHAN WELLS A SETTLEMENT SB FORTY SEVEN WAS PASSED AND SIGNED JUST LAST YEAR RAISING FEES ON PRODUCERS- FROM ONE MILLION TO FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY- WE BELIEVE THAT YOU OUGHT TO GIVE CAL JIM SOME TIME TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THIS PROPER STAFFING IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY SPEND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THEY'VE ACTUALLY NEVER DONE THAT. IN A CALENDAR YEAR. THIS BILL IT ALSO FORCED PRODUCERS TO MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR POTENTIALLY UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING TO ACCELERATE. ORPHAN WELL REMEDIATION USING GENERAL FUND SURPLUS DOLLARS THAT'S THE FIRST. STEP IS PRODUCER MEMBERS CANNOT EVEN GET NEW WELL PERMITS APPROVED BY CAL JIM TO DRILL IN EXISTING. LONG TERM OIL FIELDS IN ORDER TO PAY TO RE MEDIATE OUR OWN WELL STOCK LET ALONE PAID AN ASTRONOMICAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION MORE SO. CURRENT FUNDING IS AS FOLLOWS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE O. G. A. F. FROM PRODUCERS AND THE PER BARREL FEE. THERE IS ALSO SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIT TO OFF. HOWEVER IN TWENTY TWENTY DEPARTMENT FINANCE RATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE HIP OFF- IN A SPENDING ON GENERAL FUND PURPOSES UNRELATED TO THE REMEDIATION OF WELLS WHICH IS A PROBLEM FOR US BECAUSE WE DEPOSITED THAT MONEY IN THERE. THROUGH THE IDYLLWILD MANAGEMENT PLAN. FINANCE CLAIMS THEY'RE GOING TO REIMBURSE THOSE FUNDS ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WONDER WHY NOT THIS YEAR. WHY NOT NOW. PLUGGING HOUSE WELLS IS SUCH A JOB PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. THEN FINANCE SHOULD REFUND THOSE FUNDS IMMEDIATELY- THEN THERE'S AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE THE IDYLLWILD MANAGED PLAN REGIME WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH THE OIL. THREE COOPERATED WITH. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON- OIL PRODUCES A REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR OWN WELL STOCK EASING THEIR OWN MONEY ANNUALLY. FOR THEIR REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY MARGINAL WELLS AND PAY FEES INTO THE HEAD OFFICE THAT'S WHERE. THE SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GROWING. IS COMING FROM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE HEAD WALK RIGHT NOW SO HERE'S THE POINT. THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THE STATE DOES NOT END UP WITH ORPHAN WELLS IS TO ALLOW OIL PRODUCERS. TO CONTINUE PRODUCING CRUDE OIL THE CALIFORNIA DEMANDS EVERYDAY USING CALIFORNIA WORKERS SO PRODUCERS CAN PLUG THEIR OWN. WELLS USING THEIR OWN MONEY. IN CONCLUSION ON TOP OF ALL THIS FUNDING THE BY THE MINISTRATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE BILL ASCENDING UPWARDS OF ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA FOR THIS VERY SAME PURPOSE. MEMBERS THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY FOR DEALING WITH ORPHAN WELLS. THIS BILL IS PREMATURE- AT A TIME WHEN WITH WITH COUNT WHEN CAL JIM HAS A LARGER STAFF THAN EVER BEFORE. WHICH IS PAID IS MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL ALSO THAN EVER BEFORE THEY ARE SITTING ON OVER ONE I COULD ASK YOU JUST TO WRAP UP QUICKLY OKAY. THANK YOU SIR YEP ON A THOUSAND PERMITS TO DRILL SOME OF WHICH ARE FOUR YEARS OLD- WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR NO VOTE.

MISTER CARING MEMBERS ALL THE EURO REPRESENTING WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE A TWEENER WHICH IS THE NO POSITION ON THE BILL. AND MISTER CHAIR WE READ WAS ADDRESSED AND CAL GRANT SUBSISTING EXPENDITURE FORTY IF THEY RECEIVE THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND MONEY- THE APPROPRIATION AS YOU KNOW WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HOWEVER IF IT'S THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO INCREASE ASSESSMENT ON OPERATORS WHICH BUT WOULD BE IN OPPOSE POSITION. WHERE WE READ THE BILL BALLOTS AT ADDRESSING THE EXISTING EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OVER CAL JAM IF IN FACT THEY RECEIVE GENERAL FUND MONEY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE INDULGE THAT TWEENER POSITION WITH A LITTLE EXTENDED TIME BUT EVERYONE ELSE WISHING TESTIFYING OPPOSITION- JUST NAME AFFILIATION POSITION THANK YOU.

NEXT THE CLOVER LINE FIFTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD CALIFORNIA RESIDENT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE AND I AM- OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE OKAY THANK YOU SIR NEXT. AND A FINAL REMINDER PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWELVE NINETY FIVE I'M THIRTY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. WHAT PART OF THE OIL PRODUCERS ALLIANCE. I OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU NEXT OPEN. YES GEORGE FORMER GENERAL PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE OKAY VERY GOOD- SEEING NO MORE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS- MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR- YES AN EARLIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOME. I THINK HE HE THERE'S A GLOBAL ISSUE HERE WHICH IS IF WE WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH.WHICH ARE SHORT TERM POLLUTANTS AND METHANE. LEAKAGE FROM EXISTING CAP WELLS COULD ACCOUNT 49213% OF THE STATE'S WEEK AGENTS SO IN TERMS OF OUR CLIMATE EFFORTS THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND I WANT TO SALUTE THE OFFER. FOR THE FACT THAT SHE'S WILLING TO TAKE THIS ON I THINK THAT THE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE DEBATE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER AROUND ONE ISSUE. AND THAT WAS THE ISSUE OF FUNDING BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION MADE. THAT THIS JUST APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING FUNDING BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THERE'S FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED. AND THE IF THERE IS A TIMING ISSUE ABOUT WHEN THE MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE I WAS GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR. TO WALK US THROUGH THAT WHAT WHAT BECAUSE IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO RAISE THE CAP BEFORE GETTING OUTSIDE MONEY. ARE SO WALK US THROUGH THE FUNDING ISSUES SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU AND YES SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED SOME FUNDING FOR THIS AND THAT FEDERAL MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED THROUGH THE BUDGET WHAT WILL BE A TIMING ISSUE THAT WILL NEED TO GET WORKED OUT IN IN IN IN A POLICY CONVERSATION SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD. IS THE PIECE FOR CAL JAM DOES AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT AND THE BUDGET ALLOCATION IS ACTUALLY NOT ALIGNED WHEN CAL JIM DOES THEIR ASSESSMENT IS A DIFFERENT TIMING THAN WHEN THE BUDGET- SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT AS THIS BILL POTENTIALLY. AT MOVES FORWARD- THAT THE REASON THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID THAT TO GET YOU KNOW CAL CHEN HAS NOT DONE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION WHAT WE DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THAT WE'VE NEVER AUTHORIZED THEM TO DO MORE AND PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS ABOUT AUTHORIZING TO DO MORE. ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW THROUGH PASSED TALK ABOUT COLLECTING YOU KNOW A ROLLING FUN- BECAUSE CALTRAIN HAS TO BE SO SPECIFIC IN HOW THEY FIX THESE- WELLS WHEN THEY'RE ONLY CAPTIVE THEY WERE CAPPED AT ONE MILLION THERE NOW CAPPED AT FIVE MILLION. AT WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO OVER BUDGET SO THEY'VE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THESE WELLS- AND STAY UNDER BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THAT REMAINDER BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE A PERFECT NUMBER I MEAN IF YOU'VE EVER DONE BUDGETING FOR AGENCIES JUST NEVER PERFECT. EVEN FIVE MILLION- THAT THAT MONEY THEN GETS PUT INTO AN ACCOUNT WHERE WE CAN COLLECT UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS- WHERE IS ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW THIS THIS COST COMING FROM AN END AT WHITE SUCH HIGH NUMBERS. WELL BECAUSE WE'VE RECEIVE WEAVER C. AND- OF THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THIS CAN COST THE STATE AND- FROM FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. TOTALLY GET THAT THERE'S THAT'S A BIG BIG RANGE AND THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE THERE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT TO A HIGHER NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE BILLION. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT TO A HIGHER NUMBER AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AND- STRAIGHT. UP TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT WE'VE DONE AT ONE MILLION OR FIVE MILLION AT THE TIME. BUT AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING I MEAN IT'S GOING TO TAKE US IF WE'RE DOING FIVE MILLION AT A TIME. A HUNDRED YEARS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HERE- AND I THINK THAT. THE REASON. THAT YOU KNOW I WENT FROM A BILL LAST YEAR TO ALSO. A BILL THIS YEAR IS BECAUSE OF. ALLOCATION THEY ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO THIS. AND AT LEVELS WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WE'RE GONNA GET TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. BRING A POSITION TO NOW HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS LEVERAGE FEDERAL LEVERAGE WHAT WE HAVE. I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON STATE AGENCIES AND THEIR EFFICIENCY AND WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID OR DID NOT DO. I THINK THAT'S BEST ADDRESSED WITH THE AGENCIES AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR POLICY BILL. THERE ARE A AND THEN LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT. BECAUSE ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID JEEZ CAL JAMISON. STAFFED UP TO DO THIS BECAUSE- A AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT IF WE ACTUALLY GET A FEDERAL. PATIENT AND LIST THE LIMIT TO ACCOMMODATE FEDERAL ALLOCATION THEN WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE CAL JIM THAT THEY SHOULD STAFF UP. ACCORDINGLY AS OPPOSED TO. USING THE FACT THAT THEY'VE STEPPED UP FOR A CERTAIN LEVEL AT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE FEDERAL ALLOCATION AND STAFFING. WE GET IT IS. THAT THE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE AND I THAT THAT'S PART OF A OF THIS CON. AS WELL I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS APPROACH- IS AN APPROACH THAT AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CAME OUT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- OIL WELL ABANDONMENT AND REMEDIATION- ANALYSIS THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE-ARE A LINE WHERE WHERE THE L. A. L. IS TELLING US. THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN TERMS OF THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND TAXPAYERS- SO THIS IS AGAIN AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN WE HAVE THE CCSD REPORT WE HAVE ELLIE- I MEAN WE HAVE MANY WHO HAVE SAID THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A DIRECTION- THAT WE SHOULD BE GOING IN. AND THEN MISTER CHAIR COMMENT OF I THINK THAT THIS EXCHANGE ED THE PRESENTATION AND EVEN DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE TESTIMONY CHAU THAT THIS IS A MOVING TARGET R. AND THE QUESTION IS DO WE WISH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND DO WE WISH TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE COMING FROM OTHER SOURCES AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES AND- THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THE AUTHOR. IN TAKING THIS ON WHICH IN SOME WAYS THANK WORSE ARE GIVES US THE VEHICLE TO ADDRESS THESE AS THE DIFFERENT PIECES FALL INTO PLACE SO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WILL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL OKAY WILL RECOGNIZE THAT IS A MOTION- DO ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SEEING NONE I'LL MAKE A QUICK COMMENT THE ONE OTHER POINT I WOULD JUST READ. IN THE IT WAS NOT IN THE AND NOW. BUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACK. IN AB ONE REASONS I ATTENDED EMPATHIZE SOMEWHAT WITH THE INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS CONCERNS. IS THAT THE INDUSTRY ITSELF. EVAN IS STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT. ALL OPERATORS. LIABILITIES CEASE PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY SIX THANKS TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE BACK THEN- BELIEVE IT WAS A GYM COSTABILE- NOW CONGRESSMAN COSTA- EXEMPTING ALL PREVIOUS OWNERS FROM LIABILITY. AND SO THE INDEPENDENCE OF TAKING CONTROL OF THOSE ASSETS GOING FORWARD- END UP BEING THE SOLE BEARS A RESPONSIBILITY- AND IF THEY GO BANKRUPT IT'S ON THE TAXPAYERS SO I THINK PART OF. PART OF BEING ABLE TO LAND THIS ISSUE IS ALSO MAKING SURE WE HAVE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES- BETWEEN THE INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAJORS WHO- EXTRACTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF THOSE ASSETS PARTY NINETY SIX BUT NOW. BECAUSE OF A UNFORTUNATE QUIRK IN CALIFORNIA LAW- ARE THEMSELVES EXEMPTION THAT LIABILITY GRANTED WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PLUGGING AND ABANDONING GOING ON WITHIN THE MAJOR FIELDS OF THE LARGER OPERATORS BUT- THAT DOESN'T DO MUCH TO DEAL WITH THOSE- THE SMALL ONES PARTICULARLY THOSE CLOSEST TO COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE COME. CLOSE TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND- PLACES POVERTY- WE HAD A- WELL JUST- GO OUT ON US A FEW WEEKS BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF L. A. LITERALLY BEHIND. THEM MY SISTER IN LAWS HOUSE AND THE SHOULDER WE GO TO EVERY WEEKEND AND- YOU KNOW LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S A LOT OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE AND WE ALL GOT TO COLLECTIVELY- PITCH IN AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING A BILL FORWARD IN OUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND- WILL BE HERE TO HELP YOU GOING FORWARD TO- IT'S A MOTION FROM SENATOR LAYERED- WHICH IS. DO YOU PASS BUT- FIRST REFER TO COMMITTEE ON A- BUT BEFORE WE TAKE THAT ON. THE ROLL CALL WILL ALLOW CINNAMON CLOVES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP I MEAN THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN HAVING FOR A VERY LONG TIME- AND IT'S COMPLICATED AND IT'S HARD- BUT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THESE WELLS OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN USED- AND THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. YOU KNOW ABANDONED AND PROPERLY UP PLUG IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES- I WILL CONTINUE. WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THIS IS A DIFFERENT AREA WHERE WE HAVE THESE FEDERAL ALLOCATIONS AND SO IT'S A REYES DIFFERENT. KINDS OF. ISSUES THAT WEREN'T AROUND IN PREVIOUS YEARS- AND I WILL DO THE BEST TO MOVE FORWARD BUT YOU KNOW BALANCING REALLY AS THE INDUSTRY COMMITMENT AND PARTNERSHIP HERE. BUT WITH TAXPAYERS PROTECTING TAXPAYERS- A AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAS BEEN AT THE CORE OF WHAT I'M DOING SO WITH THAT- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

AS CALIFORNIA FACES LONGER AND LONGER FIRE SEASONS EACH AND EVERY YEAR IT'S VITAL THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT SERVICE. WHO OF THOSE WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EACH YEAR A YEAR AND THAT'S CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS. NOW I WANT TO BE HONEST CALIFORNIA IS FACING A FIREFIGHTER SHORTAGE WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER YEAR TO FIX IT THE SEVERE SHORTAGES THREATEN THE LIVES AND HEALTH OF CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS GREAT STATE. LEGISLATION BEFORE US IT'S BIPARTISAN IN PROPOSES A MODERN DAY STAFFING PLAN FOR CAL FIRE THAT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING THE IMMEDIATE HIRING OF ADDITIONAL. ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FUR FIREFIGHTERS. ENOUGH THREE SIXTY FOR NEW FULL TIME FIREFIGHTER. TO GET FULL STAFF UNITS ON ITS- ENGINES WITH THREE PER RANGING A MINIMUM. IT'S AND TO NOTE THAT MOST LOCAL AGENCIES ALREADY HAVE THREE OR MORE FIREFIGHTERS THE ENGINE. FEDERAL FEDERAL AID IN SOME PLACES HAVE FOR ON AN ENGINE IN THE STATE. MINIMUM OF THREE AND A HALF. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH CAL FIRE AS WELL. ADVANCING THE MANDATED MINIMUM FOR FIREFIGHTING HAND CREWS WOULD ALSO BE IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD INCLUDE ALL THE ON GOING FIRE CREWS FOR CALIFORNIA'S SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES AS WELL. NOW INCLUDE KERN. LOS ANGELES MARIN. ORANGE SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ADVANCE A MODERN DAY STAFFING PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA- THAT WOULD FOCUS ON STAFFING AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. DUE TO STAFFING SHORTAGES WHAT WERE SEEN EACH AND EVERY YEAR. FIREFIGHTERS IN CAL FIRE WORKING LONG OVERTIME HOURS. MANY ARE GOING ON FIRE MISSIONS FORTY DAYS IN A ROW WITH NO DAYS OFF. AND WE DEPLOYED FIREFIGHTERS AS WE ALL KNOW. BECAUSE EACH OF YOU HAVE HAD CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN YOUR DISTRICT. THEY'RE WORKING SOMATIC CONDITIONS. WORKING AWAY FROM FAMILIES.

I AM MISTER CHAIR NOBODY IS GIVING UP. OKAY VERY WELL I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE THAN MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONED CENTER LAYER YES- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND THAT IS- THIS ALSO SEEMS TO BE OF A REAL BUDGET ITEM IS THEIR COMPANION BUDGET ASK THAT GOES WITH THIS AT THE SAME TIME IF THERE IS A BE A PARALLEL BUDGET ASK. FOR THE COMPLETE HIRING OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR FIREFIGHTERS PLUSES STAFFING STUDY WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND AT THAT WOULD BE FIRST YEAR A LITTLE LESS ON GOING BUT I'D- THIS YEAR WOULD BE TOO SO THERE'S A CHANCE WE COULD ALL RALLY AROUND THIS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND YOUR BILL WAS FORCING THAT DECISION. IS THAT. SAID OKAY. IT IS ENDEMIC. AND THE CALM IS I WAS LOOKING AROUND AT MY FELLOW MEMBERS AND ALL OF YOU WERE SITTING IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE OF MY NEIGHBORS LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRE BURNED WITHIN TWO MILES OF US IN. THE END IT WAS ESSENTIALLY ON FOUGHT THE FIRST DAYS WHAT WAS BURNING THROUGH RURAL RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND THE BIG ISSUE WAS IS IF THERE WERE A MILLION ACRES OF FIRES BURNING ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO SAME TIME AT THEIR WORK TO RESOURCES AND IT WAS SUCH THAT OUR CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT CUT OFF FIREWIND CITY LIMITS AND WAS JUST ARE FIRED APARTMENT THERE IF THERE'D BEEN A BIG WIND YOU WOULD COMMENT AND I THOUGHT WERE A TEMPERATE. COASTAL TOWN WITH FOG IN THE SUMMER AND WE WERE PACKED AND READY TO GO AS WORLD FOR NEIGHBORS AND IT'D I GET ASKED ALL THE TIME IN THE DISK WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY'RE ADEQUATE FAR RESOURCES SO THAT WE DON'T FACE EXACTLY THE SITUATION AGAIN AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE PERFECTLY AND SETS IT OUT REALLY CLEARLY AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WHEN YOU TAKE AMENDMENTS LIKE. ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU SIR MR TO MOTIONS. LAYERED SAN HERTZBERG. KNOWS WE- ENGAGE IN THE ISSUE OF THE- WE HAVE MANY PURPOSES IN OUR ENDEAVORS AND THE BEST PUBLIC POLICY OF THOSE THAT ADDRESS MANY ISSUES SYMBOL TENUOUSLY. IN ADDITION TO THE OBVIOUS NEED WITH RESPECT TO RESOURCE FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS- AN ADDITION TO THE POINTS MADE BY. CENTER LAYERED IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. THE DATA SHOWS THAT THESE FIRES THAT KEPT BURNING PRODUCED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AUTOMOBILES ON THE ROAD. SO WE HAVE ALL THIS IMPISH POLICY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND YET- THAT YOU READ THE STUDIES FROM CARBON YOU READ WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY FROM THE INTERNATIONAL. FOLKS IN THE UNITED NATIONS WHAT THEY SAY WHAT WE'VE DONE AND HERE'S A HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE IF WE COULD PUT A FEW KEY- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO EARN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT YOU LOOK AT AT THIS APPROACH FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE NOTCHED TWO TERMS OF PROTECTING PROPERTY AND LIVES IN THE ENVIRONMENT ALL THE OTHER ISSUES. BUT CERTAINLY ON THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES SO FOR THAT AND THEN. THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION RETURNS I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. OKAY THAT SAID SIR MOTION- FROM CENTER HURTS- GOOD GROVE IN CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR VERY MUCH FOR HIS CONSISTENT AND KIND AND VERY THOUGHTFUL PROCESS THAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE FIREFIGHTERS ARE TAKING CARE OF WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE TIME HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING EIGHTY DAYS IN A ROW. WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- MENTAL HEALTH IS A AVAILABLE TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE STRESSES ON THEIR JOB AND- I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR AND I OVER TO THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER GROVE CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL LET JOIN THE CHOIR OF THINKING FOR THIS WORK I AM I AM MAYBE THE ONLY ONE UP HERE TO DATE HAS NOT HAD WILDFIRES IN MY DISTRICT ALTHOUGH I DID LOSING A CABIN IN TWENTY TWENTY- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AROUND. AND I ALSO AT THE PROPER TIME LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR- IT. THE BILL AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THAT FIREFIGHTERS AND WILL BE TAKING ON MORE MORE OF PREVENTION AND FIREBREAKS. WHICH IS VITALLY IMPORTANT- IT BUT- TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR UTILITIES ARE CAL FIRE EVERYBODY AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. FUNDING AS IT RELATES TO- REALLY GETTING IN THERE AND CLEANING UP AND RUNNING THE FIRES. IS THERE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES BUILT INTO THIS AND ANY KIND OF WAY- FOR THE INCREASE FUNDING. INCREASED RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT WITH- AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN PROTECTED OR PROJECTS OR IS OR ARE THESE FIREFIGHTERS MORE WHEN THE FIRES BREAK OUT THAT'S WHEN THEY DEPLOY. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. SO- ONE THESE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX AND THE ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING SO RIGHT NOW CAO FIRES ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN STAFFING PRINT CHEN THE CHIEF AT THREE- STAFFING WITH FORCED OVERTIME THOSE ARE FULL TIME IF YOU WILL OFFICER POSITIONS- THAT WOULD BE ON THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR AND- IN THE OFFSEASON IF THERE IS EVER AN OFFSEASON HOW FAR FIREFIGHTERS ARE OUT DOING THAT TYPE OF MANAGEMENT WHAT YOU JUST SAID- I'M THESE FIRE CREWS- THAT WOULD BE HIRED OUR TEN MONTH TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES OR SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS. IN AGAIN THE INTENT IS THERE ARE LAST IN BACK I DO AND I AM FIGHTING FIRE BUT WHEN TIMES ARE QUITE. I MEAN I DID YOU TAKE MANAGE WORK. INTERNALLY WE CAN HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. END THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF HIGH CHAIR OR CASKEY INJURES SKINNER- THROUGH THE BUDGET IN THE PRO TEMP- WE'VE SEEN DOUBLE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. IN FORCE MANAGEMENT FINDING OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS ADVANCE FROM THIS LEGISLATURE. HOW FIRE EMPLOYEES PEAKED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. AND WE NEVER GOT BACK. YET WERE NOW FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO TODAY- WORD WHERE THEY'RE BURNING A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND AS YOU ALL KNOW WORK TWO MILLION ACRES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS EACH YEAR. SO THE INTENT WOULD BE- SAYS MAJORITY LEADERS THAT YES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUELS MANAGEMENT WORK IN ADDITION TO FIGHTING FIRE- BUT I ALSO HAVE TO SAY WE CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE. SIGNIFICANT FINDING OTHER GOVERNORS ARE PROPOSING ONE POINT THREE BILLION THIS YEAR THE VAST MAJORITY OF ITS GONNA GOING TO PAGE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE TO GET ADDITIONAL BODIES ARE OUT ON THE LINES NOT A SINGLE SAY'S THIS. WHAT CENTER LAYERED HEDGES SAID IN I GREATLY RESPECTED HIS. OPINION IS FORMER. SECTOR NATURI SOURCES. JUST AS HE WAS SAYING THAT HE WAS WAITING FOR ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS TO ARRIVE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LITERALLY HAVE BEEN CALLING. KALIFORNIA IF THE DIRECTOR OF OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES IN BEGGING FOR RESOURCES. THANK YOU. AS COMMUNITY AFTER COMMUNITY ON THE NORTH COAST IS BURNED DOWN. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MUTUAL AID NOR CAL 5% NOW TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW ESPECIALLY WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IN THE YEARS TO COME. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. ADVANCES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE WE ARE UNDERSTAFFED HE NEEDS AND WOMEN AND MEN ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST BRIEFLY THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR HIS. LEADERSHIP YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR OF POUNDING THE TABLE- THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARY YEAH AND- YOU KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE DOOR SHUT IN OUR FACE AND IT'S NOT OUR FACE IT'S IS THE FACE OF EVERYONE HURTING OUT THERE WHO'S WORKING IN THE FIELD AND IT'S ENOUGH. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRAVERY IN PUSHING THE ENVELOPE HERE AND ASSERTING THIS LEGISLATION I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS THE LEGISLATURE IS BEHIND YOU- ALSO APPRECIATE JUST YOUR YOUR WORK IN IN ELEVATING THE CONTRACT COUNTIES ISSUES- THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL WE KNOW THAT WE RISE AND FALL TOGETHER. AND- YOU KNOW I SAW THAT VERY STARKLY MYSELF DURING THE WILL THE FIRE- AND IT WASN'T RISING TOGETHER WAS ACTUALLY FALLING IN SOME WAYS TOGETHER. AND TO SEE THE RESOURCES OF L. A. COUNTY BE DEPLOYED AWAY FROM L. A. COUNTY UNDER THE MUTUAL AID PROGRAM BECAUSE WE WERE SHORT UNDER THE BROADER CORRECT IN THE BROADER STAFFING LEVELS AND GO FIGHT A FIRE IN PARADISE TRY TO SAVE THAT COMMUNITY AND GO FIGHT A FIRE IN HILL. OUT OF VENTURA WHICH WE WANTED TO DO AND THEN TO BE LEFT WITH NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO CUT THE FUEL BREAKS THE STOP THAT FIRED IT STARTED UP IN THE FIELD LAB WHERE WE COULD CUT A LINE AND WE DIDN'T. WE LOST OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOMES I LOST MY HOME A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST I THINK GETTING CAUGHT. UNDER RESOURCE LIKE THAT IS AN AVOIDABLE TRAGEDY AND WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SOLVE THAT HERE- AND I APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONN BE LOOKING AT THAT SORT OF. ALL IN STRATEGY WHERE WE HAVE THE CONTRACT COUNTIES UP AND HISTORIC STAFFING LEVELS AND WE HAVE TWENTY EIGHTY ONE OF THE BROADER STATEWIDE HISTORIC STAFFING LEVELS AND WE CONSIDER RESTORE ACROSS THE BOARD ON BOTH ITS STAFF AND ALSO FOR- OUTSTANDING EQUIPMENT NEEDS WE KNOW IN PLACES LIKE KERN THE LAND MAP IS QUITE LARGE MAYE THAT PERSONNEL NEEDS AREN'T AS BIG BUT THEY MAY MEET NAY DOZERS OR- ORANGE COUNTY MEDIAN MASTICATING. AB BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE PURSUING AGGRESSIVELY. TO CENTER LAIRD'S POINT ALSO- THIS IN THE BUDGET COVER- AT HOPING TO MAKE SOME PER- BEYOND WHAT WE- WE MADE LAST YEAR- BUT I JUST WOULD NOTE THAT IN THAT JOINT OPERATION STRUCTURE. IT'S BEEN CRUCIAL TO HAVE- THESE CONTRACT COUNTIES IN THE SPOT WHERE- THEY HAVE FOOTING AS WELL BECAUSE- WE'RE MOVING A LOT OF PEOPLE OF THE STATE DURING CRISES AND WE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. I WANT COMMUNITY BURNING DOWN IN ANOTHER SO. TO AVOID THAT CHOICE I'M I'M- STRONGLY SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION FOR FROM SENATOR LAYERED SO ALL RECOGNIZED- THE CENTER AND ALLOW MISTER WORKLOADS. THE QUICK. I THINK YOU CAN. ENSURE STERN FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS END COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT CONTRACT COUNTIES WE ALL WORK TOGETHER I ESPECIALLY IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH A DATE- AN AWFUL YEAR. FOR THE FIRE SERVICE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE MORE FIREFIGHTERS DIED FROM SUICIDE IN. ON THE JOB. IN IT IS EVEN WORSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE AS STATE LEADERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THIS CHALLENGE IN FIX THE FIRE FIRE SHORTAGE. I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO WILL BE ADDED AS CO AUTHORS TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EACH OF YOU WHO ARE CO AUTHORS NOW WANTED KNOWLEDGE- THIS GROWTH WAS THERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AS WELL AND TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND- AT THE LAST THING ON THE STATE. IS THIS. IS THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK. ON THE BUDGET SIDE OF THIS ISSUE. TO WORK TO SECURE THIS AND THIS LONG TERM STACKING PLAN THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. NOT JUST NOW BUT FOR A DECADE OUT BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THE CONDITIONS IN THE FORESTS ARE JUST GONNA GET WORSE. AND IF WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF THIS SHAME ON US IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE MOTION IS A DO PASS AS AMENDED. BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHIEF CONTEMPLATES CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM THREE S. B. TEN SIXTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN. STERN ALRIGHT JONES ALAN. EGGMAN HI EGGMAN ARI GROWTH I DROVE. HURTS HERTZBERG. WAYS LAYERED ARE LAYERED A LOAN. MON ALL RIGHT. OKAY THE MEASURE SIX WILL WILL EVEN CALL THANK MISTER LEADER- SO WE DO NOT HAVE OR IN ORDER I DON'T THINK CENTER CABALLERO. CENTER HER TADO BUT I DO SEE THE DEAN OF THE SENATE HERE- EVER READY ON ITEM SIX SO WE'LL DEFER TO YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. AND ALLOW YOU TO PRESENT FILE ITEM SIX. S. C. EIGHT EIGHT. THE END OF THE DAY I DID. OF YOUR OWN REQUESTED BY MY RECEIVE HER. THE NEW YORK GOING BY VERY WELL. VERY WELL THAT FIND THEIR WORK. WE'VE GOT THAT GO WEALTHY ARE ALL VERY SO ISSUES THE WE HAVE US. THE THAT WE HAVE X. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HAVE BEEN UTTERLY DEVASTATING AND I WILL ATTEST SINCE I HAVE REPRESENTED THE OF THE MOST AFFECTED AREAS. THE TWO AREAS. OF GREATEST FIRES IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA THEY'VE COME TO VISIT THE AREA THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT. I SAY PRIVILEGE IT IS A GREAT AREA TO REPRESENT BUT IT'S BURNING UP. AS IT MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT NOW THESE FIRES ARE SO HUGE AND CATACLYSMIC. IT ISN'T JUST THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE NOW AFFECTED. LEISURE ENCROACHING ON OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS URBAN INTERFACE NOW. THEY'RE BURNING RIGHT INTO OUR CITIES. IN FACT I REMEMBER BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE FIRE IN BERKELEY. DESTROYED ONE OF- MY COLLEAGUES HOME. IN BERKELEY GENDER NICK PETRUS. SO WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PERSONNEL AS WELL AS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE LAST HEARING BEFORE US. WE NO LONGER HAVE IN MAKE TRUCE. BE DEPLOYED I HAVE LONG ADVOCATED FOR CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TO HELP FILL THAT VOID. AND THEY HAVE BEEN BUT WE'RE STILL SHORT HANDED. AND WE NEED SOME REASSURANCE THAT THOSE RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE. AS THE- CREDIT FOR SEEING AUTHOR DID SO WELL WITH KNOWLEDGE. WE REPRESENT VERY SIMILAR THE AFFECTED AREAS. AND I'VE REPRESENTED A NUMBER OF THE COUNTIES THAT HE NOW DOES REPRESENT. AS WELL. SO WHAT THIS BILL IS INTENDING TO DO IS TO BRING SOME ASSURANCE. AND THIS GERMAN I WOULD ACCEPT AS AUTHORS AMENDMENT ALL THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE- I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH US IN THE SENSE AND THESE AMENDMENTS ALL OUR TO AFFIRM THE PURPOSE. OF ENSURING THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. IT'S GONNA OF REPRESENT A KIND OF A TURNAROUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE GOVERNOR GENEROUSLY PUT SUBSTANTIAL MONEY AND FOR FORCING WHILE AND MANAGEMENT. BUT HE SUBJECTED BUT TWO OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RATHER DEAD. THE FINDING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WAS QUOTE NEEDED. WE'LL HAVE DUBBED IT. IT'S NEEDED THE LEGISLATURE PUT IT IN THERE IT IS NEEDED NOW THE GOVERNOR AND FINANCE ONE INDIGO SHADE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. COMMITTEES THEN FINE DO THAT BUT DON'T JUST UNILATERALLY USURP THAT AUTHORITY. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS LEGISLATION. I WISH TO ASSURE A REVENUE STREAM FUND AS AN ASSURANCE. THIS WOULD BE FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESPONSE FUND. AND THE SPECIAL DISTRICT FIRE RESPONSE FUND. BOTH OF THOSE ARE IMPORTANT AS MINUTE KNOWLEDGE IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING AND MANY OTHER HEARINGS WE'VE DEALT WITH. SPECIAL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE ARE CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT TO WHAT WE DO. THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THE BALL FIRE FUNDS REMAIN INTACT WITH THE STABLE YOU CAN COUNT ON IT REVENUE SOURCE. NOT SUBJECT TO DETERMINATION THE DEPARTMENT FAMOUS LET US APPROPRIATE. FUNDED BY THIS LEGISLATION. THEN IN THIS BUDGET. THAT THAT WE THEN CAN BE ASSURED THAT PERSONNEL WILL BE AND RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE. FOR DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEIR PROPERTIES. THEN UNDERSTAND THIS ISN'T JUST LIVES OF HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S ALMOST NEVER MENTIONED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS ON THE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. THE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE. AND THE FISHERIES AS WELL. THE POLLUTION AND I'VE LOOKED AT. I LIVE RIGHT ON THE RIVER AND RED BLUFF SO I GET TO SEE FIRSTHAND MANY SOURCES. LOADING THE RAVAGES OF FIRE. AND THE SILTATION. THAT COMES FROM THE EROSION. THE PHILS. OUR OUR VERY VITAL. RIVERS AND AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO CONVEY CALIFORNIA WATER TO OTHER AREAS FROM THE SOURCE AREAS. TWO OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S NEEDED HAVE THE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED. TO ASSURE AND ENSURE THE RESOURCES CAN BE THERE. IT BILLS ON AND COMPLIMENTS THE PRECEDING AUTHORS. LEGISLATION DOES NOT. CONTRADICT NO HAN. I THOUGHT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THIS FAVORABLY. FOR THE PREPARATION I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR MISTER SCOTT KAUFMAN THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS. MISTER KAUFMAN IF WE MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN. YES ED THANK YOU- AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO I THINK AND IF THAT'S YOUR ONLY LEAD WITNESS I THINK THAT'S A FAIR OKAY GREAT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN PASSED NARROWLY AFTER COSTLY AD CAMPAIGN THAT EMPHASIZES BENEFITS FOR SENIORS WILDFIRE VICTIMS AND IS ABLE TO HOMEOWNERS WHILE LARGELY AVOIDING THE ISSUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER. AS VOTERS DISCOVER THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE ASSESSMENT MARKET VALUE OF PROPERTIES TRANSFERRED WITHIN FAMILIES WITH ONLY LIMITED EXCEPTION ANGER IS GROWING. AS WHY WE'D OUR DOORS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IS GATHERING SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT. THAT WOULD RESTORE THE TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS CONTAINED IN PROPOSITION FIFTY EIGHT AND ONE EIGHTY THREE THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S THAT ARE ARE A INITIATIVE ISN'T WHAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY WHAT IS BEFORE YOU IS A SOLUTION TO PROVIDE PERMANENT. FUNDING TO UNDERSTAFFED RURAL FIREFIGHTER DISTRICTS AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGE OF OUR INITIATIVE ACA WOULD RECAST THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR BOTH THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESPONSE FUND. AND THE SPECIAL DISTRICT FIRE RESPONSE FUND. REQUIRING THE TREASURY TO ANNUALLY TRANSFER AN AMOUNT EQUAL 21% OF SPECIFIED STATE REVENUES. FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE CALIFORNIA FIRE RESPONSE FUND. SCA EIGHT WOULD REPLACE THE SMALL AND ON CERTAIN SLICE OF REVENUE RAISED BY INCREASING PROPERTY TAXES ON CHILDREN WHO HAVE JUST LOST PARENTS WITH A RELIABLE AND FAR MORE GENEROUS FIRE FUNDING SOURCE. FIREFIGHTING IS AN ISSUE STATEWIDE CONCERN AND SHOULD BE FINE ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN GRIEVING THE DEATHS OF THEIR PARENTS. SB EIGHT RACES FIREFIGHTING UP TO THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE IT DESERVES IN THE STATE. BUDGET AND FUNDS IT ACCORDINGLY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH BY SAYING THAT PROP. EIGHT IS NOW A LOOPHOLE. IT WAS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY BY BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS BROUGH PROVED BY 7475% OF TE ELECTORATE. FURTHER THE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS GATHERING SIGNATURES FOR INITIATIVE SO WHAT YOU MAY HEAR FROM TODAY. SOME FORTY HAVE HEARD FROM TODAY- ARE NOT OUT OF STATE MILLIONAIRES THEIR NORMAL PEOPLE CONCERNED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE TAXED OUT OF THEIR ABILITY TO BUILD INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH AND FINANCIAL SECURITY THROUGH PROPERTY OWNERSHIP.

THE CPF WAS A PROPOSED CONSERVATION A LEVIN WHICH ULTIMATELY BECAME PROPOSITION NINETEEN WHICH PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY- THE CIRCULATING INITIATIVE MEASURE WOULD RESCIND THE INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER PROVISIONS OF THE TAX CODE THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON NOT ONLY THE FIRE FUND AS WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESIDENT REVENUES AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE.

MISTER CHAIR THE IN ORDER. WAS QUEUED UP THIS TIME. OKAY VERY GOOD. WHAT IS CENTER HERTZBERG FIRST. THANK YOU VERY MR THANK YOU. CENTER NIELSEN- YOU KNOW THE POTEMKIN HAS- ASKED ME TO WATCH ALL OVER ALL OF THE VARIOUS SAID BALLOT MEASURES AND KIND OF MONITOR THOSE THINGS ON AND I KNOW THAT WOULD WAS MENTIONED HERE THAT THE EFFORTS ARE VOLUNTARY AND THEY ALSO KNOW FROM THE WORK THAT I DID MANY YEARS AGO THAT WE NOW REQUIRE A 25% THRESHOLD TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THRESHOLD FOR THIS MEASURES NINE OR NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE AND TWENTY NINE VOTES. AND IT'S REQUIRED TO BE TURNED IN BY MAY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS LESS THAN A MONTH AWAY. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT A- 25% THRESHOLD LOADERS POSTED- CERTAINLY THE OBLIGATION OF THE SIGNATURE GATHERS IN THIS BEING TIED TO THAT. I'D LOVE TO ASK THE FOLKS FROM STE FROM- HOWARD JARVIS WHETHER OR NOT. BECAUSE AT LEAST FROM THE PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS THAT I'VE BEEN MONITORING YOUR YOUR CERTAIN JUST A VOLUNTEER BASIS SO I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT. BUT I WANT TO GET SOME SENSE AS TO WHERE YOU WERE IN THAT PROCESS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE NOT THE 25% THRESHOLD. AT THIS POINT AND YOU'VE GOT NEARLY A MILLION SIGNATURES THAT HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET THEM INTO. I JUST WANTED THE FIRST PART OF MY INQUIRY RELATES TO THE PROBABILITY OF THIS EVEN BEING RELEVANT. SO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORS LEAD TESTIMONY THAT'S CORRECT. VERY GOOD. TEARS WERE THE PETITIONS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW- YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED 25% IN HAND I THINK THIS AS YOU SAID VOLUNTEER EFFORT I THINK THE MINDSET IS DIFFERENT FROM PAID SEARCH YOUR CAMPAIGN WORDS. THEY'RE PAID RETURN SIGNATURE SO THE INCENTIVES RETURN SIGNATURES I THINK HERE THE INCENTIVE IS TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT AND WE'RE SEEING THAT OUR OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE HOLDING ON TO SIGNATURES FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND SENDING BACK IN AND GREATER. ARE COMING BACK GREATER NOW- WE STILL BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH SIGNATURES OTHERS QUALIFY. I GUESS CAN PART OF THE CORE. YES RELATED WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE FIVE. BUT THIS MEASURE- RECORDING TO THE REALTORS WILL PRODUCE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLD TRANSFERS A YEAR. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO MONEY TO GROW IN THE COUNTY I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY USERS WILL BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS LET'S ASSUME THAT- MRS MOSKOWITZ BOUGHT A HOUSE IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT WAS PRE SEVENTY EIGHT SHE BOUGHT THE HOUSE SAY FOR TWENTY THOUSAND TODAY THE HOUSE IS WORTH TWO MILLION- CERTAINLY THE TAX BILL IS MAYBE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS BEST. IF SHE SELLS IT IS WORTH TWO MILLION THE TAX BILLS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE NEW FAMILY THAT MOVES IN. AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE. HUGE AMOUNTS TO REVENUES ARE PROJECTED. I'M JUST THE- THE IN MADE BY MR SCHUMER'S. IS IT FOR ALL THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THESE TURNOVERS AND NEW FAMILIES YOU CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY AND MOVE INTO THESE HOMES SO IN ADDITION EVEN IF YOU HAVE A REVENUE STREAM WHICH- ASK SPECIFICALLY ANY CREATING OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND MANY ME TAKING MONEY FROM. FOSTER KIDS IT MEANS YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM PRESCHOOL IT MEANS YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT COME ON THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MONEY BUT I'VE LIVED THROUGH A TIME. AND HAD MONEY IN EVERY NICKEL MAPPERS SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING AND IF THIS WOULD BE THE LAW THE TWO POINTS OR REYES AND ASK YOUR IN QUERY ON OUR ONE THE CROWDING OUT OF THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES DEGREE SAFETY THAT'S WHEN BOTH OF YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TO DOWNTURNS. AND THE SECOND IS THE REVENUE STREAM RELATING TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE FACT THAT THIS WAS DESIGNED IN LARGE MEASURE SUPPORTED BY MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE IT PROVIDED A REVENUE STREAM BY VIRTUE OF UNLOCKING THAT THOSE TAX DOLLARS AND THAT EQUITY IN THOSE HOMES YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE TWO ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE. WELL MY COLLEAGUE THIS IS A MATTER OF PRIORITY EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF PRIORITY. AND WHAT WOULD BE MORE OF A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN LIFE AND PROPERTY. AND WILDLIFE. THAT'S VERY MUCH SHIBLEY MY ANSWER THAT THIS OUGHT TO BE NECESSARILY WOULD BE AND WE CAN'T JUST GRIEVE AND WRING OUR HANDS WHEN THE FIRES HIT. THEY WILL HIT. RECENT HEADLINE ARTICLE IN THE- TO BE. THIS YEAR THAT'S AN ASSURANCE THAT IS IN THE MAY BE. AND IT IS IN THE MAY BE EITHER THAT WE HAVE NOT NEGLECTED WE HAVE INDEED NEGLECTED REMOVING THE FUEL SUPPLIES. IN A FOREST THE WILD LANDS IN THE INTERFACE. SO I WILL ARGUE. TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT IS A PRIORITY OF GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT PARTICULAR IN THIS AREA. PERSONNEL. AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AREN'T EASILY JAMMED UP AND BROUGHT ONLINE. FIREFIGHTERS AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE FIREFIGHTERS OPPOSITION HERE I THINK THEY HAVE OTHER MOTIVES PARTICULARLY IN THAT THEY ONLY THIS VERY MOMENT EGGNOG WHICH THEIR OPPOSITION. THIS BILL HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE IT SEEMED LIKE THEY COULD HAVE SAT DOWN AND TALKED IN THE OTHER PERSON WHO SAID WELL LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. WELL AWARE OF HER CONVERSATIONS BEEN HERE TO FOR. I CONSIDER THAT ROUTE AND NOT CONSISTENT WITH COURTESY AND PROCESS. BUT BACK TO THIS IS CENTRAL POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY. NOT JUST WHEN THE FIRES HAVE DESCENDED UPON US. AND AS I ACKNOWLEDGE OF THAT IN MY OPENING REMARKS. URBAN AREAS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES I MENTIONED BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE. AND OTHER COMMUNITIES. THAT OTHER MEMBERS TESTIFYING HERE TODAY HAVE MENTIONED ONE OF WHICH I USED TO REPRESENT. WE DIDN'T USED TO HAVE A FIRE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS IN SANTA ROSA. NOW WE DO. THIS COME IN THE URBAN INTERFACE. IT'S GOING TO BE THERE IT IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. SO IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE WITH ME THAT WE COULD BETTER DEPLOYED FIRE PREVENTION RESOURCES THAT'S A CONVERSATION. THAT IS JUST. BUT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW ARGUMENT. IT DOESN'T BEAR WEIGHT. TO THE CITIZENS WHO LOST EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING. I WAS PRESENT ON SCENE AN ON SITE FOR THE PARADISE FIRE. PEOPLE LOST EVERYTHING. AND I REMEMBER STANDING THERE ONE NIGHT. WITH THE POLICE CHIEF. THEY SAID JIM HERE. SO IT IS A PRIORITY AND THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWERS CAN I SHOULD ONE FOLLOW INSTRUMENT SURE YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. AND I- IT IS A PRIORITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE ONLY QUESTION I WAS TRYING TO ASK IS WE ALREADY HAVE PAID FOR IT. YOUR LEGISLATION DOESN'T SAY. YOU'RE LEGISLATION DOESN'T WE HAVE A REVENUE STREAM YOU'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE THAT REVENUE STREAM OR REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER ONE. BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW THE ONES OF PORTER'S PROPOSITION. THERE ISN'T EVERY DOLLAR IN YOUR PROPERTY HERE MEASURES ICS BECAUSE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT THIS MAKING A PRIORITY AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY PROP NINETEEN PASSED IN LARGE MEASURE IN MY JUDGMENT I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT. THE TEST IS NOT WHETHER WE HAVE THE REVENUE NECESSARYTO SUPPORT FIRE WHICH OF COURSE THIS MEASURE DOES THAT'S THE LAW NOW. SUPPORTED BY THE VOTERS THE TEST IS YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE REVENUE STREAM AND REPLACE IT WITH GENERAL FUNDS THAT THAT HAS AN IMPACT THAT WAS THE POINT. SO YOU'RE A 100% RIGHT AND I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE IN TERMS OF IT BEING A PRIORITY I'M JUST LOOKING AT WHAT THE REQUIRE OUT SHOULD BE PAID FOR. OKAY THANK YOU- SIR ALAN. YEAH I'M I I'M I'M OF MANY MINDS OF THIS AYE I'M CERTAINLY OF A VERY DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT THE MERITS OF PROP NINETEEN THEN MY COLLEAGUE- BUT I THINK THAT HE BRINGS UP A LOT OF REALLY GOOD POINTS ABOUT HOW WE'RE BASICALLY JUST SHIFTING CHAIRS ON THE ON THE DECK HERE- WITH REGARDS TO PAYMENT I'M I'M SO CAN I I'D LIKE TO GET SOME MORE. I WAS ONE OF YOU PEOPLE DID NOT VOTE TO PUT PRIDE NINETEEN ON THE BALLOT ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE AND BECAUSE I SAW THAT IT REALLY- WHILE IT WAS PUSHED AS SOMETHING TO HELP- YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO WANTED TO. DOWNSIZE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY- AND THEN OF COURSE THE ADS WERE ALL FOCUSED ON VERY WEALTHY- INHERITORS WHO YOU KNOW WANTED TO MAKE A BIG INCOME OFF OF- OFF OF. RENTING OUT A PLACE THAT THEY INHERITED. I'M THE MEASURE ALSO HAD THE OTHER IMPACT WHICH IS THAT- YOU KNOW FOLKS WHO INHERITED THEIR PROPERTIES WHO WANTED TO MOVE INTO THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR PARENTS. WE'RE WE'RE SCREWED FIVE FIVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE PROPERTY VALUES HAVE INCREASED SO SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT'S- THAT YEAH THAT THAT WAS. IT I WAS MY- PROBLEM WITH WITH THE WAY WAS FRAME UNFORTUNATELY- THAT THAT PIECE OF THE STORY WAS NEVER REALLY GOING TO AMPLY DISCUSSED AND- IT'S TRUE DID PASSED. THE ELECTORATE BUT IT WAS A VERY SLIM MAJORITY I MEAN FIFTY ONE TO FORTY NINE. SO 'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER SENSE THOUGH AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THE PROPOSAL IS I MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN MADE AWARE I'D LOVE TO ASK- OUR FRIEND FROM THE JARVIS'S ASSOCIATION- IT SAYS THE ANNOUNCES THAT. THE REPEAL THE DEATH TAX ACT APPEARS TO REPEAL MUCH OF PROP NINETEEN. BUT IT IS IT DOESN'T REPEAL ALL AGES REVEALS SOME. AND THEN I THINK IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN IT'S POTENTIALLY VERY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES START TO GET US INTO A- UP. A REVENUE. PROBLEM I GUESS IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. WE ARE REALLY TO INTERRACIAL. BURKE IT REMOVE THAT IN DOING SO IT. FOR. THAT RICK. A YOU TO THE OF CALCULATION THE PORTABILITY ASPECT. ASPECT ANY IF THERE'S A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE THAT COST SAVINGS GOES IN THE WILDFIRE FUND OUT INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER THAT CALCULATION CAN'T BE MADE. SO OUR BILL WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO IN THAT INSTANCE STORY PLACING ONE TWENTY THREE WITH ANOTHER. I WOULD SAY THE PORTABILITY PART A BIT BUSY MAYBE SAVE YOUR PLACEMENT FINISHING ANOTHER. IT'S NOT CREATING NEW REVENUE TO PAY FOR. RIGHT SO YOU'RE JUST TAKING. MONEY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY SERVICES THAT HURTS CONCERNS WERE OUT WORK I'M NOT ISSUE WORKER YOU OVERSEE. PHONE CORRECT GOTCHA OKAY AND I'M SIDING. BUT I- IN THE AND THEN AND I IF THERE IS ANY LOSSES IN REVENUE TO COUNTIES- HER DRIVING FROM IN OUR INITIATIVE OBVIOUSLY- IN OR IF YOU HAVE ANY LOSSES OF THE COUNTIES. DRIVING FROM THE PORTABILITY ASPECT THAT WOULD BE ALSO BACKED UP BY STATE BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S INITIATIVE THAT'S NOT. WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. I MEAN OLD ULTIMATELY THE INITIATIVE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE VOTERS RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A FUNDING. FORMULA FR. THE FIREFIGHTERS. SHOULD OUR INITIATIVE PASS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE DISCUSSION BUT NO WHY DO WE NEED I MEAN IF WE FUND. FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS. ALREADY WHY WOULD WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET GUARANTEED CONTINUES A PREPARATION WHEN. THAT'S A BUT WHEN WE FIND FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS AS A MATTER OF COURSE. THE WHITE WHITE WHY IS THIS NECESSARY. WELL IT. FROM NINETEEN CREATED DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM CONTINUES DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS WE FOUND ANOTHER CONTINUOUS DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM THAT'S ONE PERCENTAGE- FUND IT'S CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN WHAT PROP NINETEEN IS THE WHAT WHY WOULD THIS HAVE TO IT WHY WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE CONSTITUTION AT A DEDICATED CONNECTION IN THE CONSTITUTIONALITY ARE THE WILD FIRE RESPONSE FUNDS IN THE CONSTITUTION. NINETEEN CREATED THAT HAS A PROMINENT TEAM THOSE ARE IN THE CONSTITUTION. OF WELL OKAY I'M. I WAS SKEPTICAL NINETEEN I'M SKEPTICAL OFTHIS- I'M SUPPORT OF SOME PARTS OF YOUR INITIATIVE AND SKEPTICAL ABOUT OTHER PARTS OF YOUR INITIATIVE- BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'RE I MEAN I PRESUMABLY YOUR YOUR INITIATIVE IS NOT JUST FOCUSED ON. WE ARE LET ME ASK YOU ON YOUR INITIATIVE. ARE YOU JUST FOCUSED ON THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE WHO INHERIT A PROPERTY AND THEN THEY GO AND OCCUPY THE PROPERTY OR ARE YOU ALSO CARVING OUT FOLKS. WHO INHERITED PROPERTY- BUT THEN WANT TO RENT IT OUT IT WOULD JUST BE RESTORE PROPOSITION FIFTY EIGHT TOOK ABOUT TWO IT WAS. HARD WITH AREA. WITH A I'M SORRY A- IN INFLATION CALCULATION ADJUSTED FOR THE OTHER PROPERTIES AT YOUR WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS ON THE MOST SYMPATHETIC. VICTIMS A PROP NINETEEN WHO ARE THE FOLKS WHO INHERIT THE PROPERTY AND THEN OCCUPY THE PARENTS THE PARENTS PROPERTY THE PROPERTY WHERE THE PRISON WHERE THEY GREW UP AS OPPOSED TO THOSE FOLKS. WHO I THINK WERE EFFECTIVELY AND MAYBE JUSTIFIABLY VILIFIED IN THE YES I NINETEEN CAMPAIGN FOR INHERITING PROPERTY RENTING IT OUT MAKING A TON OF MONEY- BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT YEAH BUT BUT IT DOESN'T ABIDE BY THE SPIRIT OF PROP THIRTEEN WHICH INVOLVES. BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE HOME WHERE YOU GREW UP I SAID THAT. I WE JUST FELT THAT THAT THE CLEAN RESTORE WAS CLEANER- BUT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO DISCUSS CHANGES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IF I INITIATIVE DOES NOT SUCCEED THIS THIS INITIATIVE YES I CA EIGHT WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE. THE DISCIPLINE ON OUR INITIATIVE PASADENA IT DOESN'T REACH THE VOTERS THEN WE HAVE. TO RECONSIDER AND WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO. UP WITH YOU ABOUT WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE PROP NINETEEN MCCOLLUM FOR PEOPLE. I MEAN I THINK ABSENT ABSENT A CLEAN REPEAL WHICH IS OUR GOAL. OF MAKING THIS EASIER FOR THE FOLKS THAT YOU DESCRIBED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. YEAH OKAY I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU- YOU KNOW I THINK PROP NINETEEN WAS A BIG SPECIAL INTERESTS PLAY ULTIMATELY BUT I ALSO DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT WE SHOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON THE LOGIC BY PUTTING. A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION ALTERNATIVE IN THE CONSTITUTION I YOU KNOW SO I'M I'M- YEAH I WOULD I WAS THERE ARE TROUBLING YOUR BIGGEST CONCERNS ARE OBVIOUSLY THAT THE PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED. ON THE LOW INCOME FOLKS ARE NOT TO BE ABLE TO PAYS PROPERTY TAXES BUT ALSO THE OTHER CONCERN IS. EVEN FOR THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T JUST THE CLIP BECAUSE IT. IT GOES IT. CHANGED OWNERSHIP TIME OF DATE OF DEATH IT'S JUST. THERE HI JOE MCCARTHY SAYS HIS PROTECTION THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND YOUR MOVES IN TWENTY SIX HE DOESN'T. DOESN'T EVEN PAY FOR IT EITHER WAY- I UNDERSTAND IT BUT THAT IS A DOESN'T THIS I SEE. DOZENS THAT. IT DOESN'T. YEAH BUT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS IT OKAY THANK YOU. TO GROVE DIGITAL QUESTION NO I JUST LIKE TO MOVE THE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FOR AND AGAIN AS THOUGHTFULLY IN CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND- WHAT IT HAD THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OUR FAMILIES IN THE RURAL AREAS AND I'D BE HONORED TO MOVE THE BALL. BILL WELL I'M OPEN ON THE SOURCE BOOK WITH ME BUT- MY OWN INDUSTRY. AGRICULTURE SUPPORTED THE MEASURE. THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY. THE PARENTS HAVE TO TRANSFER IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE CHILD OTHERS DO NOT. THE A COMMUNITY WHO SAID OH WELL WE SUPPORT THIS AND I SAID WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WELL THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN GET IT TO. WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T GET IT. I DON'T LIKE THAT. WELL OUR BOARD VOTED I SAID FINE YOUR BOARD BOARD BOARD OTED BUT I'M GONNA LET YOUR MEMBERSHIP NO. WHAT'S YOUR VOTED. AND WHO GETS HURT. THE GENERATIONS GET HURT THIS IS A DELICATE AREA FOLKS. THANKS FOR THAT- YOU KNOW JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT AS WELL I SHARE- THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA ABOUT. THE MECHANICS OF PROP NINETEEN AND EVEN BEYOND THE EQUITY IN- RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM. THIS INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER TAX- FOR BUILDING INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH WHICH I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WORKING PEOPLE- AND FRANKLY- I SHOULD'VE DONE MORE HOMEWORK- WHEN VOTING ON THIS A. C. A. WHEN I WAS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WAS A- LATE DEAL AND CAME TOGETHER AND- I'M- AND IT WAS SOLD A CERTAIN WAY TO THE VOTERS AND YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL WHEN. WE USE THE POLITICS OF FIRE. AND THE SACRED DUTY THAT WE HAVE TO. FULFILL OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR FIREFIGHTERS- AND USE THAT AS A SALES PITCH TO VOTERS- YOU KNOW I IN TERMS OF THIS MEASURE WE TRIED TO IN THE AMENDMENTS AT LEAST MATCH EXACTLY HOW PROP NINETEEN WAS WORK FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS SO THAT THERE WOULD BE. NO CONSEQUENCE IN INACTION IN IN ACTUALITY THIS IT ACTUALLY COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IN WHAT'S EXPECTED FROM PROP NINETEEN I'M FOR THOSE FUNDS I WAS WONDERING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE AUTHOR OR THE SPONSOR HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR I THINK CAL FIRE CHIEFS ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OF FIRE DISTRICTS AS ASIAN CALIFORNIA GIVE A SENSE OF HOW THE 1% NUMBER OF CORRELATES TO THE ANTICIPATED I KNOW IT'S NOT YET KNOWN HOW HOW MUCH THAT INTERGENERATIONAL TAX WOULD RESULT IN BUT THERE ANY GENERAL ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW IS THERE A WAY TO SORT OF. TAYLOR THIS BILL A LITTLE MORE NARROWLY SO THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL. SO OPEN ENDED AND MAYBE AN OVER ALLOCATION OR TYING THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT SOME WAY TO. TO MAKE THE AMOUNT SORT OF PROPORTIONAL TO THE ANTICIPATED LOSS FROM THE REPEAL. THE L. A. I BELIEVE ESTIMATED AT TENS OF MILLIONS UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ON THIS OBVIOUSLY BE MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 1% AT CURRENT RATES- WE YEP WE WOULD BE HAVING WE ARE OPEN TO. ALL CONVERSATIONS ON THIS. SO I THINK I'M MOST ASSURED THEM TO MR MR OKAY WELL THAT THAT ACTUALLY THAT'S QUITE HELPFUL BECAUSE IF THERE'S AT LEAST A WAY TO DEAL WITH- THE TAILORING OF WHAT WHAT WE MAY CALL THE BACK. FROM OF A MORE NARROW REPEAL. AND I THINKTHAT COULD HELP POTENTIALLY WITH. THE SWORD ON THE ONGOING QUESTION OF ARE WE LOCKING OURSELVES INTO THE RIGHT STRUCTURE FUNDS. I WILL NOTE HOWEVER WE JUST VOTED ON A MEASURE THAT WOULD LOCK IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF FUND FOR ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS THAT I WAS VERY PROUD TO HELP. WITH AND CRUCIAL THAT WE DO TO MAKE THAT FUNDING SO IN SOME WAYS THIS MEASURE COULD WORK IN CONCERT WITH THE MAJORITY LEADER'S BILL- AS AN ONGOING SOURCE- BUT- THE ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAD SO. WE WE'VE MIRRORED- THE PROP NINETEEN FIRE MECHANICS IN IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU AGREED TO- BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A WAY TO- TO SORT OF LET THE- SIGNATURE GATHERING PLAY OUT AND NOT NECESSARILY AT THIS POINT. LINK THE MEASURE. TO THAT BALLOT PROPOSITION I HEARD THE CONCERNS OF. THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THE LATE HOUR ON THOSE THOSE- THOSE CONCERNS REYES AND DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR- FOR HIS FRUSTRATION WITH THAT. BUT- BUT I WONDER IF WE WERE ABLE TO FOR THE TIME BEING- D. LINK THESE TWO SO- D. LINK. S. C. EIGHT EIGHT FROM THE SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT I'M LOOKING I THINK SPECIFICALLY AT SECTION. TWO OF THE BILL WHICH HAS A BLANK IN IT RIGHT NOW IT SAYS THIS MEASURE SHALL ONLY TAKE EFFECT IF BOTH THIS MEASURE AND PROPOSITION BLANK- ARE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS AT THE BLANK STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION. BECAUSE THAT IS SORT OF A HYPOTHETICAL AT THIS POINT AND MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE FIREFIGHTERS WELL WE SORT OF WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE OTHER MECHANICS AND MAYBE FIND A WAY TO BACK FILL THIS INTERGENERATIONAL TAX ISSUE IN A MORE SORT OF TAILORED WAY- WHETHER IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE. TO STRIKE SECTION TO- AND THEN THE MOVIE. SECTION ONE AND SECTION THREE. FORWARD I KNOW WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE CURRENT BILLS AMENDED FROM CENTER GROVE BUT- BUT I WOULD BE OPEN TO A- TO A MOTION ON ON THAT MAYBE COMPROMISED POSITION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. DOES THAT HELP- CAN I ASK ONLY TO PUT HIM ON THE SPOT BUT COMMIT PASSER FIREFIGHTERS REPRESENTATIVE FROM C. P. F. IF WE WERE ABLE TO STRIKE THE LINK TO THIS REPEAL. AND I SUPPOSE IT'S THE REALTORS ON THE LINE TOO BUT IF THIS WERE NOT IN OTHER WORDS CONNECTED TO THAT BALLOT PROPOSITION EFFORT IF THAT CAME TO QUALIFY WE COULD REVISIT THAT PROVISION POTENTIALLY BUT WANT TO GET YOUR- PERSPECTIVE ON. JUST STRIKING SECTION TO- AND LEAVING SETTING ASIDE MAYBE THIS REPEAL QUESTION AND THEN FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON TAILORING THE MECHANICS YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DOUG TO RESUME HAVE A CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT CHANGE IN THE MEASURE BACK TO OUR LEADERSHIP AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T- NOT TO GET INTO ALL THE NUANCES OF THE TAX POLICY BUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF. REPEALING THE INTERGENERATIONALTRANSFER ELEMENTS OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN WILL NOT ONLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FIRE FUNDS AS ITS STRUCTURED IN THIS MEASURE BUT ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES. IN A IN A SENSE. THE FIRE FUND WILL BE FUNDED BECAUSE THERE WILL BE INCREASES IN LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR A SUITE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES INCLUDING- LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND THE SAVINGS. RELATED TO PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT ARE GENERATED LOCALLY IS WHAT WILL HELP SUPPORT THE FIRE FUND SO THERE ARE SOME. TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS OF. TRYING TO WORK THROUGH STRUCTURING- PROPOSAL TO. BACKFILL THE LOSSES AND THE LOCAL REVENUES. THE WELL OUR MEMBERS- HAVE A SEPARATE COLLOQUY- APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK- THERE'S NO MOTION ON THAT BY THE WAY SO IN MAY- BUT BUT I AM. LOOKING CENTER LAYERED PERHAPS FOR SOME. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN OFFER IMPROVEMENT HERE BECAUSE I THINK THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS IS ALL THE CONFLICTING THINGS THE LINK. TO THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THE LOSS OF FUNDS DELAYED OPPOSITION AND I ALWAYS WANT TO RESPECT THE SENATOR DEBT IS TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT AND GET TOO LATE IN THE A. N. THERE'S ONE ISSUE THIS IS SCOTT SUCH A LIFE OF ITS OWN FROM THE PROPOSITION AND NOW TO THIS. THAT THERE'S THIS OVERARCHING QUESTION THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE OVER ARCHING QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT WHO BENEFITED FROM OUR PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND I BOUGHT MY HOUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX I AM A GROSS BENEFICIARY OF THAT IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY. BOND NOT REPRESENTING THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT WALK IN- OF THAT TO A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T REPRESENT PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN OR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRONGLY IN THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA AND IT KEEPS THEM OUT OF ASSESS ABILITY TO HOUSING B. BECAUSE OF THAT. HAT HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS SO COMPLEX AND IT GETS MORE COMPLEX WITH EVERYTHING THAT I WAS PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS I HAVE TO BE THAT WAY AT LEAST THE ONE PERSON MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER AND I'M NOT RECOGNIZING IT WHO'S ON APPROPRIATIONS AND THIS IS GOING ON TO APPROPRIATIONS AN AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT ALL THESE ISSUES. A BE ADDRESSED AND SOME OF US WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN AND APPROPRIATIONS TO DECIDE. IF THEY BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE RIGHT WAY. GOOD SUGGESTION THANKS FOR CALLING GOT SURE WOULD WORK YOU ON THE- OKAY. BUT WE DO AGREE ON SOMETHING SHE CENTER CINDY- ANY OTHER KERR OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE AND WE DON'T HAVE OUR FULL MEMBERSHIP HERE- THERE IS A MOTION ON THE BILL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR WITH YOU ALL ABOUT WHAT THE MOTION IS IT IS JUST ON THE BILL. AS AMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IT DOES NOT STRIKE THE LINK TO THIS PENDING PROPOSITION- BUT WE CAN VOTE ON THAT FIRST- CENTER GUYS WAS THE I SHARE OUTSIDE ONE'S REITERATE I SHARE SOME BUT NOT ALL. OF THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS CONCERNS ABOUT PROP NINETEEN AND I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR- S. C. A. ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS. I ALSO THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THIRD PLENTY WAYS TO FIND FIRE JUST AS WE DISCUSSED- DON'T INVOLVE. PUTTING IN A MINUTE TO THE CONSTITUTION SO THIS IS THE IS THE STRUGGLE I'M HAVING HERE. OKAY HELLO MISTER I'M NOT HAVING TROUBLE REALTORS TO. I FIND THEM NOT TO BE CREDIBLE ANYMORE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ACTUALLY. AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO SHOW UP. THAT'S INTERESTING. WHAT HAVE WE BECOME. WHAT HAVE WE BECOME. THANK YOU SO WITH THAT COLLOQUY- SERIGNE WE ARE ON S. C. EIGHT EIGHT- WHICH IS FILE ITEM SIX. AND THERE'S A MOTION FROM SENATOR GROVE- WE'LL VOTE ON THAT MOTION. AS I MENTIONED I'D BE AN ENTERTAINING ANOTHER MOTION TO IS TO STRIKE SECTION TWO AND DELINK IT FROM THE BALLOT PROPOSITION WHILE WE WORK THROUGH THE REST- BUT AT PRESENT UNLESS SIGNIFICANT. WELL SO DID TRY TO ADDRESS THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL THIS BILL OR THIS CONSTITUTIONAL THEM IS LINKED TO THE REPEAL OF PROP NINETEEN- AND THAT WE MAY NOT AGREE ON WHAT EXACTLY THAT REPEAL LOOKS LIKE MAYBE IT'S TOO BROAD OF A PROPOSAL THAT WE WOULD SET ASIDE THAT ISSUE BY STRIKING SECTION TWO AND MOVE FORWARD ON THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- WHILE WE- SORT OF LOOK TO. A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR TO TAILOR THAT CONTINUES TO PROCREATION AS HE AS HE MENTIONED- TO THE ACTUAL. UNMET NEED- SO DID TO SCALE IT DOWN IT IN THEORY NOT JUST A PERCENTAGE BASIS BUT MAYBE SOME OTHER SORT OF PROPORTIONAL BUT IT'S GONNA AND THAT'LL TAKE SOME WORK AND THAT'LL TAKE TIME FOR APPROPRIATIONS BUT I DO TRUST IN. CENTER NIELSEN'S COMMITMENTS ALWAYS HERE SO- BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SEPARATE MOTIONS I THINK WE'RE FIRST GOING AFTER VOTE ON- JUST THE STREET- BILL IS BEFORE YOU AND- WE CAN. OKAY THE OTHER OPTION MISTER CHAIR- SO I MEAN YOU CAN IN YOUR BOOK IN A MAJOR MOTION. I THINK THE BILL. WITH THE ACCEPTED A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND TO SEPARATE- THE PROPOSITION AND APPEASE- OR MEET THE NEEDS THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. OKAY VERY GOOD YES SO AND SO TO BE CLEAR I WANT TO MAKE CHOCOLATE MY CHIEF CONSULTANT HERE SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MOTION WOULD BE. I THINK THE MOTION IS- TO PASS TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO STRIKE SECTION TO. SO WOULD NOT BE LINKED TO THE PENDING BALLOT PROPOSITION AND THEN- COMMITMENT TO WORK ON REFINING THE FORMULA IN SECTION ONE TO PRINT TO TAILOR IT TO THE ACTUAL UNMET NEED IN THAT AREA. BEFORE PROCREATION WE NOTE ONE NOTE ALSO THIS IS DOUBLE REFERRED BUT TWENTY CHECK WITH THE CHIEF CONSULTANT OF THIS IS ENOUGH TO OKAY THIS YEAR YES SIR JOHN CAN WE JUST GET CLARIFICATION FROM THE AUTHOR THAT HE'S OKAY WITH THAT MOTION YES YES YES I AM.

SO WE'LL GO WITH STAND FILE ORDER HERE WE'RE GONNA FILE ITEM FOR. SB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE CENTER CABALLERO WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE INTER AGENCY STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO GRANT AND LOAN PROGRAMS AND ESTABLISH REPORTING AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS OF STATE ENTITIES THAT OFFER CLIMATE RELATED GRANT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TO BUT TO DEVELOP. MECHANISMS FOR UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY AND FIND CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS RESOURCES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL TO CLARIFY THE INTENT AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO THREATEN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES WITH DEVASTATING WILDFIRES EXTREME HEAT FLOODS DROUGHT AND SEA LEVEL RISE COMMUNITIES NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO PLAN FOR AND ADDRESS THE RISKS HOLISTICALLY AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED FOR PROGRAMS ACROSS A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS AGENCY INC AGENCIES INCLUDING THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCIES AND OTHERS EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS ADDRESSES SPECIFIC COMMUNITY A REGIONAL RESILIENCE NEEDS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO WORK CLIMATE RESILIENCE IS CRITICAL OF THE PROGRAM'S REMAIN ACCESSIBLE COORDINATED TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO MEASURES OF SUCCESS. TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF CLIMATE RESILIENT PROGRAM RESILIENCY PROGRAMS SB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE DIRECTS THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A WEB BASED RESOURCE TO IDENTIFY ALL STATE FUNDED RESILIENCE FUNDING PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES AND OTHER ENTITIES SEEKING STATE FUNDING WHICH WILL INCLUDE TARGETED OUTREACH TO UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES TO DEVELOP A COORDINATED APPROACH. FOR CAN UNITS COMMUTE WHERE AND HOW THESE COLLECTIVE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT AND APPROACHES TO MEASURE SUCCESS IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE AGAINST MEASURES ADAPTED FROM EXISTING STATE STRATEGIES. AS CLIMATE RESILIENCY RELATED PROGRAMS DEVELOP ACROSS STATE AGENCIES IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE PUBLIC. AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES NO CHOIR AND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT. THE HOPE IS THAT MORE RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED ASSISTANCE IN ACCESSING CLIMATE RELATED GRANT PROGRAMS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DO SO. MY DISTRICT HAS TWENTY SEVEN CITIES ON TWENTY FOUR OF THEM ARE UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND IN POPULATION AND FOR THEM TO ACCESS CLIMATE- FUNDING- IS WAY BEYOND THEIR AT THE CAPACITY OF THEIR STAFF QUITE FRANKLY THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO COME AND DO GRANT SEARCHES AND- GRANT WRITING WRITING SERVICES AND SO THIS BECOMES REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY SINCE A MAJORITY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE SET AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE AIR QUALITY AND THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- BY DROUGHT RELATED IMPACTS AND HE RELATED IMPACTS ARE THE MOST SEVERE.

TWELVE NINETEEN. YOU CAN OF THE PODIUM AS WELL AND OUR ATTENTION THANK YOU I HOPE SO. IT'S TUESDAY RIGHT. OKAY WELL GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO OUR PRESENT SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETEEN- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE PARTNERED UP WITH- A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE ON WATER THAT IS NOT FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I AND THAT IS BECAUSE WATER SECURITY IS NOT JUST. ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S NOT JUST AT THE CALIFORNIA ISSUE IT'S A GLOBAL ISSUE. AND REPORT AFTER REPORT TELLS US THAT WATER SCARCITY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN A NEXUS FRAMEWORK WITH FOOD HEALTH ENERGY AND SECURITY ALL PART OF IT. EIGHT TWENTY TWELVE A COMMUNITY INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT REPORT ON THE STATE OF GLOBAL WATER SECURITY INDICATED. THAT BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY FORTY FRESH WATER AVAILABILITY WILL NOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND ABSENT MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THE REPORT ALSO STATED THAT DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS SO BETWEEN DID THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND MOVING FORWARD THE DEPLETION OF GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES AND SOME AGRICULTURAL AREAS OWING TO POOR WATER MANAGEMENT WILL POSE A RISK TO BOTH NATIONAL. AND GLOBAL FOOD MARKETS. IT ALSO POINTED TO WATER INSURED BASINS WILL INCREASINGLY BE USED AS LEVERAGE THE USE OF WATER AS A WEAPON OR TO FURTHER AT TERRORIST OBJECTIVES ALSO WILL BECOME MORE LIKELY BEYOND THE TEN YEARS. THIS LEVERAGE WILL BE APPLIED IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS AND ALSO INCLUDE PRESSURING INVESTORS NGO ORGANIZATIONS. AND DONOR COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT OR HOT OR HOT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. IN PART THIS IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO PERSISTENT IN FIGHTING BACK ON MISINFORMATION ABOUT SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE NINE EFFORT TO PROVIDE CRITICAL FUNDING. FOR THESE CONVEYANCE PROJECTS THAT DELIVER WATER TO FARMS AND SERVE THIRTY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. BUT I BELIEVE MORE MUST BE DONE TO SECURE OUR FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THAT WATER IN CALIFORNIA. CENTER CORTESE AND I'VE- MUST BE MODERNIZED. ANY WEIGHT THAT WE I JUST SPOKE TO IN THAT CONTEXT. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE TOOK OUT THE CONCERN OF CYBER ATTACKS ON OUR WATER AND FOOD SECTORS TO THE ALLEY GOES OFFICE LAST YEAR. AND THE RESEARCH THAT BE FOUND- BE CONCLUDED THAT IT THERE WAS A LACK OF DEDICATED CYBERSECURITY FUNDING AND STAFF LIMITS A PREPARED IT'S OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR ENTITIES. ARE THEY ALSO NOTED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CYBER ATTACKS. ON AND VARIATION IN CYBER SECURITY PREPAREDNESS OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR ENTITIES. THE FREQUENCY OF CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENTITIES INCLUDING THE WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS SECTOR. AND OF COURSE THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SECTOR ARE INCREASING. IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE OUT THERE WERE AN ESTIMATED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND CYBER ATTACKS WITH PAYOUTS TOTALING ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS ALL ENTITIES INSTRUCTORS. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE WE WERE ALREADY OUTPACING TWENTY TWENTY WITH THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND CYBER ATTACKS. REPORTED IN THE STATE WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PAYOUTS BEING UNKNOWN REPRESENTING AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF 62% THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT INCREASES IN ATTEMPTED ATTACKS ON OUR CYBER NETWORKS THAT MANY OF OUR UTILITIES AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OCCURRED JUST LAST YEAR AND IT WAS MADE EVIDENT THAT OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS FOR AT RISK. AND THIS ATTACK THE HACKERS TARGETED THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF YOU DRINKING WATER PIPE AND THE BAY ARE RAISING THE CHEMICALS TO DANGEROUS LEVELS. FORTUNATELY STAFF AT THE PLANT NOTICED THE INCREASES AND MANAGE TO REVERSE THEM BEFORE WAS TOO LATE FOR IT TO CAUSE ANY HARM. BUT THEY'RE STILL- MANY OF OUR FULL SALARIES COULD ARE STILL AT RISK FROM SUCH ATTACKS AND MANY YOU KNOW OF THESE ATTACKS ARE DONE- OF COURSE AT THE WORK IS DONE REMOTELY SO TO COMBAT A DIFFERENT TIME OF UNCERTAINTY US SENATOR CORTEZ UNITE. YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF HOW DECISIONS SURROUNDING WATER ARE MADE AND THOSE THAT MAKE THEM. WE INTRODUCED SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETEEN ALSO KNOWN AS A STATE WATER RESIDENCIA MODERNIZATION ACT TO PRIORITIZE PRESERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF WATER USAGE AND ENSURE THE WATER IS PROTECTED FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF USE. IT IS NOT ENDED IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE AN INSULT TO. YOU KNOW THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE WATER BOARD OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT BUT REALLY IT'S TO SPEAK TO THE URGENCY OF THE WATER ISSUES IN THE STATE AND THEY'RE ONLY GROWING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING. TO MODERNIZE IT. IT'S MANAGEMENT. MODERNIZING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO MEANS INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ANNEXED ANYWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WATER. CURTAILMENTS AND WHAT A HOLISTIC VISION FOR WATER IN CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE. AND AS YOU JUST MENTIONED FROM- YOUR COLLEAGUE CENTER COUPLE YET EITHER THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE AT HAND THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE WITH ACCESSING FUNDING FOR- A CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. LIVING WITHOUT WATER ESPECIALLY IN A STATE WHERE IT IS IT RIGHT. TO WATER. AT WE CAN LOOK AT A PARENT'S INABILITY TO FEED OR BAIT THEIR CHILD WITH WATER FROM THE TAP. A SENIOR WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY WATER TO LIVE ON OR IF FORMER HAVING TO FALLOW LAND. ALL OF THESE BEINGS THREATEN OUR HUMAN SECURITY AND ALL OF THEM COME BACK TO OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. WE MUST WORK TIRES TIRELESSLY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT OUR WATER. WHICH BY DEFAULT WILL PROTECT OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL BECAUSE- I BELIEVE IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK. THE PRESIDENT WAS TRAVELING ABROAD AND HE SAID THERE WILL BE SHORTAGES THIS IS THIS IS JUST A REALITY AND NOT JUST IN EUROPE AND UKRAINE OR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT HERE IN THE US AS WELL AND SO OUT WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO- ADD TO THAT. ARE GIVEN THAT. UP IN LAND WILL BE VALID FOR BASED ON THE DISK YOU KNOW DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE OR WE DON'T MAKE. AN INCREASINGLY OUR FOOD IS BEING IMPORTED AS WELL SO JUST WANTED TO POINT POINT THAT OUT WITHOUT SAID. I AM WILLING AND HAPPY TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO SECTION- ONE OF MY BILL AYE. AYE AS OUTLINED ON PAGES SIX THROUGH TEN AS THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CRAFT THESE AMENDMENTS. THE DIG DEEPER INTO THE CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE TO MODERNIZE WATER MANAGEMENT OUR STATE. OUT AND I REALLY WANT TO THINK- THE CONSULTANT THAT DENNIS FOR. ARE REALLY JUST TAKING THE THROUGH THE VISION THAT CENTER CORTEZ AND I. HAD AND A PUTTING IT INTO INTO- LANGUAGE AND IN THE FIRST SECTION THERE WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU- BUT I CANNOT TAKE IT WILL NOT TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO SECTIONS TWO AND THREE AND ON PAGE ELEVEN REMOVING THE PROVISIONS ELIMINATE THE WATER BOARD AND TRANSFER ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THE AMENDMENTS TO SECTION ONE MAKE THIS BILL STRONGER. TH MEMBERS TO SECTIONS TWO AND THREE MAKE IT WEAKER. MY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS REAL CHANGE THAT'S WHAT SECTIONS TWO AND THREE GIVE THEM. SO I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THAT FORM. AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE NINETEEN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE. ARE YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT FIRST HAND. AND HAVE SCOTT TAYLOR A GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LAMONT PUBLI UTILITY DISTRICT AND I ALSO HAVE A FRIEND CAL GALVIS A COMMUNITY MEMBER FROM TO THE STAND.

MY SPEECH IS A CHOREOGRAPHED I DIDN'T WRITE A BIG LONG THING I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU FROM THE GUT AND THE REALITY. AS SENATOR HOT HER TADO JUST MENTIONED. HERE'S THE REALITY OF IT I WORK FOR A SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WE PROVIDE WATER AND WASTEWATER. THE REALITY IS THAT THE WATER BOARD AS A WHOLE. NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED. NOW I'M NOT HERE TO THROW ROCKS AT PEOPLE OR BASH OR ANYTHING BUT I CAN TELL YOU AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS PHRASE BEFORE. IF WE CONTINUE TO DO THINGS WITH THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THEM WE'RE. ALWAYS GOING TO GET THE SAME RESULT. S. IN SOUTH. CAN AGREE WE DO NOT WANT THE SAME RESULT IN THE WATER ENVIRONMENT. SO I WOULD ASK THAT THIS BOARD IN THIS PANEL ON THIS COMMITTEE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. FOR JUST THOSE REASONS SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. THE PROCESSES FOR GETTING GRANTS IT'S COMPLICATED IT'S LABORIOUS IT TAKES YEARS. LONGER THAN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE IT TAKES LONGER THAN THAT JUST TO GET A DECENT GRANT. YES THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE WATER BOARDS TRYING TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO I HAVE TO GIVE PROPS WORDS. WHERE IT'S NECESSARY HOWEVER. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TWENTY YEARS TO MAKE A ONE YEAR CHANGE SO. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK MISTER TOTAL- SENATOR HER TADO IS TRYING TO PRESENT. IT'S TIME TO RE VAMP. JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS BILLS WERE THEY TALK ABOUT WE HAVE TO REDO THINGS IN WILD FIRES AND FIRE PREVENTION ECCENTRIC. FOR TOO LONG IT'S BEEN IN A PARTICULAR WAY.

BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ADOPTING AND PUSHING VERY CRITICAL WATER PROGRAMS INCLUDING SPEARHEADING THE STATE'S DRINKING WATER PROGRAM FOR ADOPTING CONTAMINATION PROTECTIONS BEGINNING TO ADMINISTER THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND OUT ALONG WITH ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR RURAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE SAFE ADVISORY GROUP AND ADOPTING A VERY DETAILED AND ROBUST RACIAL EQUITY POLICY- WHILE THE- BOOK. PROPOSED RIBBON COMMISSION ON CONTAINS AN UNDEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE LEGISLATURE- WHICH WOULD BE. SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE I CAME THROUGH- TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE WATER INEQUITIES. THE- THE LACK OF- ADOPTING THE MINUTES WHO- RELATING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BOARD AS- OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AND- PROBLEMATIC FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. ESPECIALLY AS PROXIMA AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER ARE NOT PROPERLY EQUIPPED OR- AND STAFF TO RESOURCE TO ADOPT THESE CRITICAL WATER PROGRAMS. I IN THE MIDDLE. OF DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORK TO. BOLSTER AND PROTECTING THE WATER FOR THE ENTIRE STATE- AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WHILE THERE ARE BOTTLENECKS AT THE STATE WATER BOARD THE- HOUSE THE WATER BOARD HAS PROVEN TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE STATE INCLUDING. OF DELIVERING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND WATER DEBT RELIEF THROUGH THE WATER WITH RE REACH PROGRAM JUST THIS LAST YEAR RELATED TO THE CODEPENDENT MAKE- SO. WE WOULD WE HAVE SEEN THIS BODY INTENTIONALLY- BEGIN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KNOWN BY MAKES OUT OF THE WATER BOARD AND INSTEAD OF ADOPTING SB TWELVE NINETEEN EVEN WITH THE- PROPOSED- AMENDMENTS WE- FOR EXAMPLE. OF OUR FIRST THE CONSIDERATION OF ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND ALLOCATIONS TO ADDRESS SOME OF. THE CRITICAL WORK AND BOTTLENECKS- IF SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO WATER QUALITY AND- APPLICATION- FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE FOR YOUR NOVEL THANK YOU.

BECAUSE WE GAVE THE OTHER WITNESS ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS AS EXTRA KALIDA A MINUTE FIFTEEN MISTER OBG. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING WBG ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE- ENERGY SEEN DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK BY COMMITTEE STAFF BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE STATE WATER BOARD AND TRANSFER AUTHORITIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THIS IS UNWORKABLE. UNDERMINES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS OVER THE WATER- YOU WATER PROJECT DOES HOLD WATER RIGHTS AND SO EFFECTIVELY AS THE MANAGER OF THE WATERING SYSTEM IT WOULD BE REGULATING ITSELF CREATING AN ENTIRE CLIP IT. OF INTEREST FOR EVERY OTHER WATER RIGHTS HOLDER AND ALL OF US WHO DON'T HOLD WATER RIGHTS BUT WHO- THE CONDITIONS ON WATER RIGHTS PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND OTHER USERS. SECOND THE WATER BOARD AND THE REGIONAL SPORTS HAVE AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS FOR. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE INCLUDING A BOARD THAT IS APPOINTED. BY THE GOVERNOR AND APPROVED BY THE SENATE- THAT REPRESENTS A BROAD RANGE OF INTERESTS. AND YOU TO BE OUR LACKS THAT STRUCTURE- WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT ESTABLISHING A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION COULD DELAY MUCH NEEDED REFORMS TO OUR NETBALL WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE- JUST GENERAL WITNESSES ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM SEEING NONE.

HI MY NAME IS CODY PHILLIPS I'M WITH CALIFORNIA GO DEEPER LAN JOHN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS QUEUED UP. OKAY I'M SEEING THAT WE'VE HEARD. ALL SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION- I MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT AND BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE- YOU KNOW IT WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS OF WATER AND ARE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS IT'S- THE WATER BOARD IS ALWAYS AN EASY TARGET. AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS FAMILY IN AGRICULTURE AND FARMING AND RANCHING- I KNOW THAT'S THE COMMON GREAT BUT- I THINK THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ON THIS DISSOLUTION NOT JUST RUN CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT AROUND- SOME OF THE MAJOR EQUITY AND INTEGRITY ISSUES AROUND THE DELTA AND MORE BROADLY- TO ME. MAKES THIS THAT THE DISSOLUTION PORTION OF THIS BILL- INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC AND THAT'S WHY THE COMMITTEE DID PROPOSE- TO STRIKE OUT- THOSE SECTIONS BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFFS HARD WORK AND THE AUTHORS HARD WORK. ON TRYING TO PUT A GOOD FOOT FORWARD HERE ON A BROADER BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THAT THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD IDENTIFY A LOT OF THE NEEDS EVEN IF THE OPPOSITION THEMSELVES REYES- AND I WOULD I WOULD ASSUME. THAT THIS WILL NOT IN ANY WAY IMPEDE OR SLOW DOWN- THE DELIBERATE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON TO DELIVER JUSTICE ALL THOSE COMMUNITIES- SO I'D I'D BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE WITH WITH THOSE COMMENTS IN MIND. I RECOGNIZE SENATOR HERTZBERG PERFECT- THANK YOU STRIVE A REALLY ON ECHO YOUR COMMENTS IN THE WORK OF. YOUR GOOD STAFF WHO I HOLD IN THE HIGHEST REGARD AND SO I'D LIKE TO AYE I'D HEARD I AM FORTUNATE TO RACE UPSTAIRS AND WASN'T SURE I CLEARLY HEARD. BY THE AUTHOR'S THOUGHTS ON THIS BUT TO MAKE IT CLEAR I WON'T MISS YOU CHERYL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MAYBE IF IT'S NOW IS THAT OKAY. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE PASS THIS MEASURE SB TWELVE NINETEEN AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND NOT IN ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT WHICH INCLUDES THE NEW FINDINGS YOU WOULD BE AFFECTED. REWORKING RIBBON SHE'S A REWORKED BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND STRIKE THE TWO PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE THE STATE WATER BOARD IF THAT'S OKAY THAT'S MY MOTION. OKAY SAID TO MOTION FROM SENATOR FOR ITS BERG- SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WILL BE VOTING ON THE BILL WITH ALL THE AMENDMENTS- IN THE COMMITTEE IN OUR RIGHTS. SO THAT MOTION IS A DO PASS AS A MAN BUT FIRST A MINUTE RE REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. I WOULD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS I'D ENTERTAIN THEM BUT WE CAN ALSO COME BACK TO THE AUTHOR FOR. CLOTHES YES SIR HE I FEEL LIKE. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE MOTION I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT- I FEEL THAT SINCE THERE WAS AN ANIMATED DEBATE. A LITTLE OF IT SHOULD BE COMMENTED ON AND- OF. THE EASE THE DENTURE STING THING HERE'S THIS. IF I WERE STILL NEED MINISTRATION THIS WOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE WATER BOARD TO ME. AND THE- OF. IT IN. HER I WOULD OPPOSE THAT. IT EXCEPT FOR THEIR THERE IS AN ORGANIZATIONAL AND HISTORICAL REASON FOR DOING IT AND THAT IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WAS SET UP. TO HANDLE AGENCIES THAT REGULATE. AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WAS SET UP TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES. AND THERE IS A REGULATION OF THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM. AND THERE'S A MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THAT IS A PRO PRICKLY SEPARATE AND THERE WAS A TIME I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I WAS A WASTE BOARD MEMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOLISHED THE WHITES BOARD AND IMMEDIATELY SENT AWAY SUPPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO RESOURCE. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I ADVOCATED THE SECRETARY OF RESOURCES WAS REORGANIZING AND MOVING IT BACK WHICH WE DID BECAUSE IT WAS A REGULATORY. AGENCY AND IT BELONGED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT DID REGULATION. AND IN THE TESTIMONY I TOOK SOME NOTES. WHAT ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FOR THE BILL ON AMENDED SAID WE NEED TO BE BUILDING DAM WE NEED TO BE FUNDING MONEY FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE. NONE OF THAT IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE AGENCY WHETHER IT'S MOVED OR NOT BUT THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN ARGUMENT. FOR BLOWING IT UP THERE WAS ANOTHER COMMENT THAT. WHAT REGARD TO WATER GRANTS AND CLEAN WATER GRANTS THAT IT TOOK TWENTY YEARS WHILE THE CLEAN WATER PROGRAM IS ONLY BEEN IN THE WATER BOARD FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS. OF SO IT WAS SORT OF THAT WAS THE REASON IT WAS MOVED IS THE PREVIOUS LOCATION OF THAT GRANTS PROGRAM WAS NOT GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SHOWS. THAT THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE MOVE BETWEEN THE AGENCIES. AND I THINK WHAT'S AT THE ROOT OF THIS IS THE VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION. THAT HELLO I HAVE RIGHTS TO MORE WATER IN CALIFORNIA THAT EXISTS AND THEN WE GIVE AN AGENCY THE OBLIGATION TO MEDIATE THAT SITUATION. AND IN AUSTRALIA WHEN THEY HAVE THE NINE YEAR DROUGHT. THEY ACTUALLY REVAMPED THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM. AND THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ASSIGN A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO AGRICULTURE A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO MUNICIPAL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE IT MATCH WHAT THE NEEDS WERE AND WHERE THE WATER WAS. AND WE HAVE AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T GIVE OF RIGHTS TO PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO CONSERVE OR THAT THEY CAN TAKE MORE THAN MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER THINGS AND SO. I THINK THAT THE PROPER LEGISLATIVE WAY TO GO IS WHAT IN THIS MOTION BECAUSE IT IS WE SHOULD STAND BACK FROM JUST ASSUMING THAT BLOWING UP AN AGENCY IS THE ANSWER TO ALL OUR- OUR CONCERNS. BUT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND THEN DECIDE WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS AND THAT'S WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MOTION. THANK YOU THE CONTEXT AND THE COMMENTARY- SO THE MOTION. IS A IS TO PASS AS AS AMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT FIRST AMEND RE REFER TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SANATANA WOULD LIKE CLOSE. ONCE AGAIN EMPHASIZE REITERATE THAT- I REALLY STRUGGLE I FEEL STRONG ABOUT THIS BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT I SEE IN MY DISTRICT THAT CHALLENGES. AND THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT THEY THAT THEY FEEL AND THIS BILL AGAIN THIS IS NOT TO THROW ANYONE REALLY UNDER THE BUS IT'S JUST THAT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WATER WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE NEED TO MODERNIZE IT I MEAN LOOK THESE. THE LAWS THAT PUT THAT THE WATER CONTROL BOARD LIKE BOOK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN WAS WHEN THE WATER AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WHAT WAS RELEVANT THEN IS NOT RELEVANT NOW. RIGHT WERE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT TIME AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO. PUT ACROSS IN MY IN MY IN MY TALKING POINTS IS THAT NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CYBERATTACKS WILL WHO'S GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT WHO THAT WHO HAS TO REGULATE THAT WHO'S OVERSEEING THAT NOBODY. NOBODY'S OVERSEEING THAT OUR WATER SYSTEMS ARE AT RISK WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AND SO- IT THIS WEEK YOU KNOW ALSO I WANT TO YOU KNOW. POINT OUT THAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD PPULUM UNAIDED I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING HEY LOOK WE GOT ELIMINATE THE RESPONSIBILITIES I. SIMPLY- JUST START RIGHT- I KNOW THERE'S ALSO MENTION ABOUT THE SAFE ADVISORY BOARD. AND FUNDING FOR CLEAN WATER PROJECTS WILL. I'M A PART OF MY PART OF MY CHALLENGE YOU KNOW AFTER THE SIGNAL FOR WILL DRINKING FUND ACT HAPPENED WAS MAKING SURE THAT THE- FUNDING ACTUALLY WENT TO PROJECTS AND COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT A LOT OF IT WAS BEING SPENT ON. ON OVERHEAD TAKEN COMMUNITIES HERE'S AND THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER. HURDLES AND CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE TO OVERCOME TO BE ABLE TO GET. PROJECTS MOVING AND MOVING FORWARD AND- AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO REALLY YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN THANK- THE CONSULTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE DENNIS BECAUSE- IN A PART OF HIS COMMENTS IN INDIA ANALYSIS IS THAT. I MAY WANT TO BROADEN IT AND YES THAT WOULD THAT I. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF. A PUTTING FORWARD THIS THIS- THIS POLICY IDEAS TO REALLY BROADEN IT BECAUSE WE HAVE. TWENTY FOUR- AB STATE ENTITIES THAT GOVERN WATER ONE WHAT SMEHOW OR SOMEWAY TWENTY FOUR. IMAGINE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE TRYING TO GET CLEAN WATER AND HAVING TO NAVIGATE ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES. I DON'T I. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT I MEAN. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF ANY ONE OF US WOULD KNOW HOW TO DO THAT- DEFECATE THIS THIS COMPLICATED OUR- SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN PLACE- AND I AGREE THAT IT LOOKED THERE'S THE- PROPS DEFINITIONS MAYBE THAT'S PERHAPS. WHY WERE SEEN INCREASES IN FREEZE TO WITHIN THE STATE WATER BOARD. THERE WAS SOME LAST YEAR THERE'S PROPOSALS THIS YEAR. R. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GOT BE LOOKED OUT WE GOT TO HAVE. SOME SORT OF TRANSPARENCY OR- OVERSIGHT OVER OVER THE SPORT OVER THE SPORT AT MINIMUM I THINK IN MY OPINION. AND WHILE I'VE GOT YOU I REALLY DO APPRECIATE- YOU'RE A CONSULTANT IN THE COMMITTEE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD- I STILL THINK THAT THIS SECTION ONE IS JUST. REALLY MUCH NEEDED R. AND WHILE I KNOW THAT. PERHAPS THE SUPPORT MAY NOT BE THERE IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING THE WATER BOARD- I'D I'D STILL LIKE TO SEE THAT THAT THAT PROVISION AT MINIMUM BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND SO- I JUST WANTED JUST ALSO. I SAY TO ADDITIONAL THINGS ON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. ATTEND A WATER BOARD MEETING MEETING YOU'LL KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. NOT MANY NOT MANY CONSTITUENTS NOT MANY PEOPLE FROM THE STATE CALIFORNIA THE OTHER THING WATER RIGHTS SYSTEMS OUR WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH IT AND MAKING SURE THAT. WE JUST DON'T JUMP THE GUN UNTIL WE GOT TO DO THIS AND EXT YOU KNOW CHANGE AT ALL AND- WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE WAY WE DO NOT SEE THAT WE DON'T NEED REFORM TO SAYING THAT. WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THIS IS A NATURAL RESOURCE THAT IS VERY PRECIOUS AND VERY. MUCH SCARCE AT THIS POINT I THINK- SO- WITH THAT- I WILL. I WILL. HAVE RESPECTFULLY CLOSE AND THANK YOU ALL AND DENNIS FOR WORKING WITH ME ON ON THE- FIRST SECTION- AND- HOPEFULLY. YOU CAN SUPPORT THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU. SORRY MR CARE CAN GET A POINT OF CLARIFICATION SURE BOUNCING BETWEEN YES ON THE MOTION YES THANK YOU SO THE MOTION IS.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE GET LESS OF IT. AND LOTS OF CHALLENGES RELATED TO IT AND I JUST WANT TO OPEN MY COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE BY READING JUST A COUPLE OF HEADLINES. IN VARIOUS MEDIA OUTLETS THAT I THINK FORM THE BASIS OF ME DOING THIS BILL. SIERRA SNOWPACK FAILS TO FALLS TO ONE OF ITS LOWEST LEVELS IN SEVENTY YEARS THE MERCURY NEWS. DATA SHOWS THE DRIEST YEAR. DRIES JANUARY THROUGH MARCH IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AB SEVEN NEWS. LAKE POWELL IS ABOUT TO DROP BELOW CRITICAL LEVEL REACHED. A NEVER REACHED BEFORE IS DROUGHTS RAGES ON CNN AND LASTLY WESTERN. MEGA DROUGHT IS WORST IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS AND I KNOW YOU AROUND SENATOR. A LAYERED BUT IT'S A LONG TIME AGO CHANGE STUDY FINDS. WITH THAT BEING SAID MEMBERS AND I'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS AS FAST AS I CAN BECAUSE IS A LOT OF OPPOSITION. WE'VE GOT A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. IN SO WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE GOVERNOR BROWN TO DO A- A TRAILER BILL. ASSEMBLY WHAT A WOMAN- FRIEDMAN AND I PUT TOGETHER TO BILLS. PACKAGE OF BILLS DEALING WITH- WATER CHANGING CONSERVING WATER AS WE KNOW IT. IN PART OF THAT ENDEAVOR OF WHAT WE DID TO SOME COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS WE ASK- THE D. W. R. A. TO. TO TAKE A LOOK AT AT INDOOR STANDARDS. AND THEY COME BACK AND REPORT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE. AND SO WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN TERMS OF THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO SET THOSE STANDARDS. ARE ARMED AND IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE JUST LAST WEEK'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. THERE'S ANOTHER STARK WARNING IS I SUGGEST TO THE TO WHAT I TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE HEADLINES DEALING WITH THE WORST DROUGHT. THE WORST OF THE DROUGHT HAS YET TO ARRIVE. AND WHAT I GOT TO SAY IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND WE AS A STATE. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF EFFICIENCY I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH WITH THE ELECTRIQUE ELECTRICITY STANDARDS AND FOR APPLIANCES BACK WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN THE FIRST GOVERNOR. THE SECOND GOVERNOR BROWN THE FIRST JERRY BROWN. DID THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS FOR APPLIANCES WILL GUESS WHAT. NOW THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS AT THE R. P. S. THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS A 20% IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET. SAME THING EXIT EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE TAIL PIPE EMISSIONS WITH CENTER PAVLEY. THAT WE WORKED ON WHEN I SERVED IN GOVERNMENT LAST TIME. AND SO NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SET THE INDOOR STANDARDS OF WATER- WHICH IS REQUIRED STATUTORILY IS RESULT OF OUR LEGISLATION. ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN AND MY AND MY OWN. ARM AND THERE'S BEEN A TWO YEAR EFFORT IN WHICH THIS IN WHICH WE'VE HELD HEARINGS SOLICITED INPUT. AND FEEDBACK FROM DOZENS OF ORGANIZATIONS TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS LARGER ISSUE. AS WE FACE THIS EXTRAORDINARY DROUGHT AND I. I ALWAYS LOOK AT THE ISSUE WATER FOR A COUPLE MORE POINTS BEFORE I. OPEN IT UP TO THE- SO PORTERS A THIS. IS THAT YOU KNOW IS WE THINK ALL OF US FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. A SUCH A YOU KNOW SAN DIEGO ON THE LIKE. YOU ALWAYS SEE THESE HORRIBLE CHALLENGES OVER WATER BUT THE FARMERS NEEDED OF COURSE TO PRODUCE EXTRAORDINARY CROPS THAT THEY GROW- ENVIRONMENT NEEDS IT BECAUSE THE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FACES. WE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN I WENT DOWN TO. TO IMPERIAL COUNTY THEY CALL THIS THE COASTAL'S AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW IRRIGATION AND SWIMMING POOLS AND GOLF COURSES. AND SO WE HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PATTERN GIVEN THE FACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY IMPACTING THIS WE'VE HAD A HUGE FIGHT. I JUST GOT ANOTHER EMAIL FROM SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER STATE YESTERDAY BETWEEN THE ALLOCATION OF THE COLORADO RIVER. YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE OVER DRAFTING NINETEEN SIXTY THREE CALIFORNIA VERSUS ARIZONA NINE HER THOUSAND ACRE FEET. I WORKED ON THE QUANTIFICATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT NOW THAT- IS OWNERS GOING NOW THAT LAS VEGAS IS GOING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES SOMEBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH. YOU KNOW RESEARCHERS MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I GOT SO SURE BUT MAYBE. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE ISSUE IS NOW THE- THE STATE LACK THE DATA TO DEAL WITH THE INDOOR WATER USAGE NOW WE'VE HIT THAT. WEEK WE'VE HAD THE STATE MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND SO NOW. ON WHERE WE AT AND WHAT WE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL WE'RE CHANGING THOSE INDOOR NUMBERS NOW THERE'S SOME CRITICISM THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. WELL YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FLUSH THE TOILET TAKE A SHOWER BUT ONCE A MONTH. IT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS A GREAT SOUND BITE BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. AND I KNOW THAT THEIR SOMETIMES TO STILL MATTERS IN THIS BUSINESS WHAT IT DOES IS WE ALREADY EXCEEDING SOME OF THOSE STANDARDS AND IT'S SUCH A- IT'S SUCH A BROAD STANDARD OF WHAT INTO IT WOULD YOU SHOULD SHOULD BE NOT. INDIVIDUALLY BUT SYSTEM WIDE IN BUILT FLEXIBILITY FOR POTABLE REUSE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT. IS IT GONNA BE MORE EXPENSIVE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SAID NOTHING'S LESS EXPENSIVE THAN CONSERVATION. YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES AN ASSUMPTION IT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE WATER IF WE AS A STATE DON'T SET THAT POLICY C. NG. CON AS A WAY OF LIFE AND SHE HOW. COMPORT OURSELVES. CLIENT THIS IS A HUGE ELEMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THOSE HEADLIGHTS TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS CENTER LET WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE BACK THEN. AND SO ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE AS A RESULT OF. STATE WATER BOARD DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP IN WITH THAT- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES SUPPORT HEATHER COOLEY FOR THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE AND LAUREN UP FROM THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR NEW ECONOMY. I ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MODERATOR LET'S MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES AND BRING ON HEATHER COOLEY FROM PACIFIC INSTITUTE AS THE CO HOST.

A SENATOR HERTZBERG WRECK THE REFERENCE EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND SET SENATE BILL FIFTY SIX. OFF RIGHT IF YOU ARE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CONDUCT. AND TO STUDY SEES ME INDOOR WATER USE AND JOINTLY RECOMMEND UPDATED INDOOR STANDARD. IN RESPONSE TO THE STATE AGENCIES CONDUCTED AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS ON INDOOR WATER USE THAT INCLUDED DATA FROM A MILLION CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS IN NEARLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT MEDIAN INDOOR WATER USE WAS FORTY EIGHT GALLONS PER PERSON PER DAY BETWEEN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS- IN RESPONSE TO THAT CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND NATIONALLY INCREASED WATER USE BUT RECENT DATA SHOW THAT THE INITIAL BECAUSE THAT CITED AN INDOOR WATER USE IS WELL BELOW PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. INDOOR WATER USE IS DECLINING DUE IN LARGE PART TO CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS IMPOSED THE GERMAN THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. THE IDEA YOU ARE STUDY FOUND THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY ABOUT 3039% OF SUPPLIERS WOULD BE BELOW THAT RECOMMENDED TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD. WITH HALF OF CONSERVATION ALONE THAT MEANS WITH JUST THE AFFECT OF STANDARDS AND CODES. ACTIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS RUN BY THE UTILITY THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS BELOW THE STANDARD WOULD BE. EVEN HIGHER. SOME OF THE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON A STANDARD ON RECYCLED WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM. LAST YEAR THE STATE BOARD PRESENTED ITS METHODOLOGY FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD AND THOSE FINDINGS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THE RULE MAKING PROCESS THE TICKET AND TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY INTEGRATED INTO A FRAMEWORK TO HELP SQUIRES MEET THEIR OBJECTIVES. FIRST QUARTER TO NOT HAVE TO MEET THE INDIVIDUAL STANDARDS THAT MAKE UP THEIR OVERALL OBJECTIVE MISCARRY IRIZARRY TENERIFE BINGE YOU HAVE EXCEEDED YOUR THREE MINUTES AND SO WOULD ASK YOU TO WRAP IT AFTER EIGHTEEN MINUTES. YES I'M TO MIDDLETON I FINALLY AND THERE'S ANOTHER THERE IS A NOTHER- LEAD WITNESS- MISS HAKEEM SO IF YOU COULD WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS. WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. YES HOW DEFENDER FEATHER SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THIS AND WITH RESERVOIRS NOW LOW OUR SNOW PACK AT 38% WE MUST TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS. TO MAKE CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL ONE ONE I THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS COOLEY- LET'S MODERATOR LET'S GO TO A LAUREN ACT KEEN I BELIEVE. AND YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE MA'AM. THANK YOU FOR CAMDEN TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE. AND WHILE NEARLY HALF OF WATER AGENCIES WANT NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE- WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS TO MEET THESE TARGETS THOSE THAT DO WILL BE ALSO HELPING TO ADDRESS EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST URBAN WATER CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES ARE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER WATER SUPPLY OPTIONS AND ARE A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE WATER NEEDS. AND A STUDY BY THE ALLIANCEFOR WATER EFFICIENCY FOUND THAT LADWP CONSERVATION PROGRAMS HAVE HELPED AVOID ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER COSTS AND SAVE CUSTOMERS TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT- THAN WHAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PAID AND WE NEED DEEP WATER EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS NOW MORE THAN EVER FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH CODE RELATED THAT. TO HELP. IMPROVE THE AFFORDABILITY OF THEIR WATER. ON AS WELL AS- THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE TO WATER AND AGENCIES TO HELP INVEST IN WATER EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.

AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THEM THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS THE JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ON AN INDOOR RESIDENTIAL WATER USE STANDARD. BILL WOULD REDUCE INTEREST UNDER TO FORTY SEVEN GALLONS PER CAPITA DAILY IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FURTHER REDUCE THE STANDARD TO FORTY TWO GALLONS PER CAPITA DAILY TWENTY THIRTY THE FOCUS OF OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ADDITIONAL THIRTY OF AN APPROPRIATE COST EFFECTIVE STANDARD FOR TWENTY THIRTY. AWKWARD COMMITTED TO LONG TERM WATER EFFICIENCY BUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THIS BILL WOULD IMPLEMENT COULD NOT QUANTIFY IMPACTS TO WATER WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER THE REPORT IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SERIOUS IMPACT BUT THEY WERE NOT QUANTIFY IT AND THEY DID NOT INFORM THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION. FOR A THIRD THE COST OF MEETING THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER EFFICIENCY PARTNERSHIP FOUND THAT THE COST TO WATER SUPPLIES TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY WATER SUPPLIERS TO MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD WOULD BE BETWEEN TWO POINT EIGHT AND FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE COST IMPACT TO WASTE WATER AND RECYCLED WATER CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS FINALLY THE STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF MILLIONS OF MORE PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITE.

FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR ITS WORK ON THE CONSERVATION LEGISLATION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT ROOSEVELT ALTERNATELY SUPPORTED WE BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATION PROVIDED AN APPROACH THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BALANCE THE BENEFITS OF EFFICIENT WATER USE ANY IMPACT TO OUR SYSTEM AND OUR RATE. HOWEVER AS SECTION SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN POINT FOUR OF THE W. R. REPORTS STATE THE RECOMMENDED ENDORSED STANDARDS WHAT HAVE I KNOWN THE FACT ON AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE THE STUDY DID NOT ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL. ECONOMIC IMPACT- IN THE HEIGHT OF THE DRAW INTO FOURTEEN. IS WHEN. CAME BECAUSE THIS TO THE TWENTY FIVE AND AREN'T. AT JUST. OF OUR WAY WATER STREET PLANT WITH FIVE SIX PERFECT COSTLY FROM A DROUGHT YEAR THREE NINE DROPPED HERE. THE LONG TERM IF.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU NINETY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS ERICA DONALD WE HAVE TO THE EAST ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AND THE YORBA LINDA WATER DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED STAND. THANK YOU ELSE IS QUEUED UP THE SPANISH CARE OKAY- SPORT IN OPPOSITION BEING COMPLETED WILL BRING BACK TO THE DIE ES DE OF IT COMING FROM CENTER HUESO- THEN CENTER LET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A CENTER HERTZBERG AYE AND- I SUPPORT GENERALLY THE CONCEPT OF- WATER CONSERVATION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY. NOW IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I THINK CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCED- A NEXUS OF TWELVE OF THOSE IN THE NEXT LAST TWENTY YEARS AT LEAST TWELVE OF IN DROUGHT YEARS. AND MEMBERS DEFINITELY- SOME NEED TO CONSERVE BUT I'M I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY COMMENTS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SAN DIEGO IMPERIAL COUNTIES SENDIC YOU'RE SENDING ONE IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO STATE THAT EVEN PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING IN THE NINETIES- WHEN THERE WAS- MASSIVE- TRANSFER WATER THAT WAS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESTINED FOR SAN DIEGO BUT METRO DECIDED TO KEEP THAT THE LA AREA. IT FOR SAN DIEGO TO CONSERVE IN WAYS THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. HAVE NOT CONSERVED AND AS FAR SAN DIEGO THEY HAVE TAKEN ON VERY AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION POLICIES THROUGH. THE THROUGH THE DROUGHT SENEGAL FARED FAIRLY WELL IN COMPARISON TO THE WRIST REST OF THE STATE. IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE SERVED IN GOVERNMENT- I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE WORKED ON- MAKING IN SAN DIEGO A CITY THAT RECYCLES ITS WATER. SO NOW SAN DIEGO IS UNDERTAKING- SUBSTANTIAL WATER RECYCLING THAT'S A AND RE USE. AND WE HAVE SEVERAL- WATER DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THAT ARE NOW ENGAGING IN WATER REUSE WE HAVE PURPLE PIPE THAT'S BEEN INSTALLED AND IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE ALSO CREATED A T. CELL FACILITY- IN THE CARLSBAD AREA THAT'S PROVIDING QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WATER TO SAN DIEGO SO. AT AS WE STAND IN SAN DIEGO THE SEWER SYSTEM AND IT IS IT'S AT ITS- POINT OF IF WE REDUCE WATER FLOWS LITERALLY THE US THE SEWAGE THAT OUR PIPES KERRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THEIR DESTINATION. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR SAN DIEGO AS WELL IT'LL INCREASE MAINTENANCE COSTS RE RECORD REGARDING OUR OUR SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS. SO SEND YOU HAS REACHED A BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW IT MANAGES ITS SEWAGE HOW IT SOURCES ITS WATER IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY AND IT'S- STILL. UNDERTAKING A VERY AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES SO- YOU KNOW I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL. WILL HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SAN DIEGO OF AFFECTING OUR OUR WASTEWATER. FLOWS AND UPSET THE BALANCE THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED IN SAN DIEGO TO ENSURE OUR OUR OUR OUR DAMS ARE DEPLETION LIKE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- SENEGAL DAMS ARE WRIT REGULAR HEALTHY AND WE HAVE ESTABLISH CONNECTION POINTS BETWEEN A RECYCLING WATER RECYCLING PLANTS AND OUR DIESEL PLANTS TO THE FOUR POINT THAT THE YOUR YOUR BILL WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTY SO I HAVE TO FEEL OBLIGATED TO STAY OFF OF YOUR BILL TODAY. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON AND HOPEFULLY. BOB YOU CONSIDER OUR SITUATION IN SAN DIEGO ON HOW. OF THIS BILL WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. THANKS FOR THE COMMENT- I'M GONNA CENTER LAYERED YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I DID A SERIES OF BILLS ON OUTDOOR URBAN LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION THAT SET UP THE CURRENT SCHEME. AND IT WHAT ONE WE DID IT WE HAD DOUBLE WORKING GROUP IT WAS OVER THREE YEARS WE DID A MODEL ORDINANCE WITH WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDE TO TAKE THEIR OWN ACTION AND IF THEY DIDN'T AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS THE MODEL ORDINANCE WAS IMPOSED ON THEM. THERE WAS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS LOCAL CONTROL AND A PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY TALKED AND GOT TO THE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THE AUTHOR AS IDENTIFIED INDOOR WATER USE AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT EVERYBODY'S COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK WITH WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. AND THE THING I APPRECIATED IS TO PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE SAID WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING. IS THIS ISSUE'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WERE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS AND EVEN THE COMMENTS IT JUST MADE DONE FIVE PROBLEMS AND SO I WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE CHANCE. TO MEET HIS GOAL WITH ALL THE IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND WORK THROUGH THEM AND GIVE US A PRODUCT THAT THAT DOES THIS BECAUSE INDOOR WATER USE IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THERE ARE STILL MANY PLACES FOR CONSERVATION AND WE DO NEED CONSERVATION AS A WAY OF LIFE AS PART OF OUR ALL OF THE ABOVE WATER STRATEGY WITH THAT IN MIND I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. OKAY THAT'S A MOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED- COMING FROM SALEM THANK YOU JUST REAL QUICK YOU KNOW AS AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A DISTRICT THAT HAS CONTINUED IN STATE IN THE DROUGHT DESPITE. SOME OF THE YOU KNOW. THE PEAKS WATCHING. BUT ALSO I AGREE THAT. I MEAN IF THERE'S NOT A BILL IS ON THE CONVERSATION AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS- BUT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. OUR REGIONS ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT ARE ADAPTING- IN TRYING TO ADAPT AND MOVE FORWARD IN DIFFERENT WAYS POSSIBLE- BUT CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW NOT ALL DISTRICTS ARE THE SAME IN TERMS OF EVEN. ACCESS TO WATER AND SO- SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL ALSO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION YOU KNOW HOW THESE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES KIND OF WAY IN- BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATION CENTER LAYERED IS DELAYED. AND I FORGOT TO SAY ONE THING YES WHEN I WAS HERE TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO I WENT TO SENATOR HERTZBERG SCHEME SENIOR. JUST FOR THE RECORD. OKAY NOW. UPDATED HIM- BUT YOU HAVE MADE A MOTION AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON THIS ISSUE SENATOR HERTZBERG- AND NOT JUST FOR INITIATING CONVERSATION BUT FOR INSISTING- ON MAKING GOOD ON YOUR YOUR PASS REFORMS WAS SENT THE SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN. ALSO JUST NOTEWORTHY I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT A LOT OF OUR LOCAL WATER AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY- STILL HOLDING OUT ON ST OPPOSING THIS BILL AND TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THIS AS WELL SO. HAPPY TO SEE THAT- FOLKS ARE IN A CONSTRUCTIVE PLACE- DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. SURE CENTER GROVE AND THEN IT WILL- CENTER HERTZBERG CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SIR IF YOU DON'T MIND FIRST AND- OBVIOUSLY THE REDUCTION FROM FIFTY TWO POINT FIVE GALLONS PER PERSON PER DAY TOUGH- FORTY TWO BEGINNING IN TWENTY THIRTY- I THINK IS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS. ESPECIALLY FOR IN HOUSE WATER USE OU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT- IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU MADE A COMMENT THAT SAID THAT PEOPLE WERE OVER EXAGGERATING AND THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CASE WAS IN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FLUSH YOUR TOILETS AND ALL OF THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF- THERE ARE SEVERAL WATER AGENCIES IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND- MMHM EVEN MORE. THAT ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED- OBVIOUSLY DEEP RESPECT FOR THE CENTER HAS SOME OF THAT AND MY GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THEM TWEETERS- WERE ADDRESSED. ARE YOU CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE MET IN THIS BILL OR IS THIS BILL JUST MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS ALWAYS TALKED TO. HAVE BEEN WORKING AS WATER STUFF FOR. TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS AND OF AND WORK WITH AUCKLAND SO MANY THE FOLKS ON BILLS FOR. AN OPERATOR HUNDRED AMONG A LOT OF OVER THE YEARS I CERTAINLY KNOW THE PLAYERS AND WHAT'S GOING ON. I JUST WANT TO SAY IF I COULD COME TO TERMS IN THE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS CHAIRMAN THE CLOTHES. IS LOOK. THIS ISN'T DONE IN THE BACK THIS IS IN A BILL THAT I. CAME FROM NO WHERE THIS IS WATER WHICH- COULD BOARD DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES THEY SPENT TWO YEARS. THEY WENT AND BE VIEWED CON MILLION CUSTOMER RECORDS. ARE PROVIDED BY THE D. W. R. HIM TO WATER SUPPLIES. THE SUBMITTED IN FOR COPART COMMENTS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WATER SUPPLY. AGENCIES IN THE REGULAR REPORTING AGENCIES THERE'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARY OUTREACH IN THAT REGARD OKAY. SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT NO ONE'S TALKED ANYBODY THIS WAS THE AGENCIES COMING TO ME SAYING OKAY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN YOU DID THIS CHANGE YOU KNOW CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE. YOU'RE SEEING ON THE ONE HAND. SENATE HUESO YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HOW MUCH WATER IS GOING TO FLOW BUT IF GOD TELLS YOU THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER. YOU DO THE BETTER WITH THERE'S A STANDARD OR NOT. THERE WILL BE A FLOW SO WE HAVE TO GET AHEAD OF IT I THINK. AS POLICY MAKERS. IN AND THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE D. W. R. DID. AND WHAT. STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD DID. THE ELECTRONIC ANALYZING ELECTRONIC ANGLE REPORTS FROM SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN AGAIN THIS IS NOT IN THE VACUUM. 78% OF WATER SUPPLIES ARE ALREADY BELOW THEIR CURRENT INDOOR STANDARDS OF FIFTY FIVE GALLONS- RIGHT. AND LIKE WAS 56% WE'RE TO BLOW THEIR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. OF FORTY SEVEN GALLONS AND THIRTY SEVEN ALREADY A HEAD OF THEIR PROPOSED. TWENTY THIRTY SO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING REALLY GOOD STUFF IT'S REALLY HAPPENING. THE LAST THING I WOULD SHARE IN GOING TO THE POINT ABOUT FLUSHING YOUR TOILET TAKING A SHOWER. IS THIS IS NOT ANALYZED ON ONE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER ALL MY GOT USUAL WATER BILL WHOSE WHICH ALLOCATIONS GOING TO BE. SPACED ABOUT WATER DISTRICT. SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE PURPLE PIPE. GUESS WHAT THE BENEFITS. SOME PEOPLE ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT. BECAUSE STANDARD IN TERMS OF HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND EIGHT BE DIVERSE. THEY GET A- AND A BENEFIT SO IT'S TRYING TO. DEAL WITH ON THE ONE HAND ALIGNING POLICY WITH THE HEADLINES I READ TO YOU ABOUT THE WORLD CHANGING AND WEVE GOT A PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE TO GET AHEAD OF IT AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOVERNMENT FOLKS OF THE STILL THE STUDY WITH THE UC AND STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS UNDERGOING IT ALL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY IF ANY NEW DATA ON ECONOMICS AND STUFF OF COURSE I WILL. AYE I'M AN IDEOLOGUE ON THIS I'M JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT. ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING AND TRYING TO ALIGN. OUR POLICY IN THE WAY TO GET AHEAD OF IT SO THAT. YOU KNOW I LIVED THROUGH THE LIGHTS GOING OFF THAT WAS PRETTY BAD WAIT TO TURN YOUR TAP. AND THERE'S NO WATER WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE INTO WHETHER WE CAN SURVIVE THAT. SO WE HAVE TO BE PRETTY THOUGHTFUL AND WITH THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE. MY CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY TURN THE TAP ON NIGHT OF CONSTITUENTS IN THE PORTABLE AREA IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THAT TURNED THEIR TAP WATER FAUCETS ON EVERY DAY. AND NOTHING COMES OUT. AND SO AS WE GO- I. LIKE IT THAT WITH ALL THE OPPOSITION IN THE WATER AGENCIES WHO ARE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT ARE NAVIGATING THIS IS STEPHEN EVEN THOUGH BOTH OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS. AND I WOULD JUST APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE. THAT CONSTITUENTS HAVE WATER AND THAT WAS MY QUESTION THANK YOU SIR. VERY GOOD THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS THANK FOR CLOSING- THE MOTION IS.

YOUR CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS EACH YEAR CALIFORNIANS CONSUME ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT'S ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS A YEAR. BUT ONLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION BARRELS ARE PRODUCED HERE IN THIS STATE BY CALIFORNIA WORKERS FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE IMPORT THE REST OF THAT OIL- WHICH IS TRANSPORTED HERE MOSTLY BY HUGE OIL TANKER SHIPS. THE AMOUNT WE SPEND ON IMPORTED OIL IS ENORMOUS IF OIL IS PRICED AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS A BARREL CALIFORNIANS PAY FIFTY MIL SKEWS ME FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. TO IMPORT THE OIL THAT WE NEED TO USE EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY TRULY THE STATE'S CURRENT ENERGY POLICY MAKES NO SENSE WITH FOREIGN IMPORTS WE HAVE PLACE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY SECURITY INTO THE HANDS OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY HOSTILE TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. IN IT COMES WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS LABOR RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. THE TOP THREE COUNTRIES THAT WE DO BUSINESS WITH ACCOUNT FOR TWO THIRDS OF FOREIGN OIL THAT WE IMPORT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY pHUNDREDS- SHE'S REPORTED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY AND A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION BARRELS A YEAR. THESE COUNTRIES ARE ECUADOR SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF FOREIGN CRUDE OIL IS ECUADOR. WHICH IS BEEN STRONGLY CRITICIZED BY ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS FOR ITS PRACTICE OF CLEAR CUTTING OR BULLDOZING DOWN THE AMAZON RAINFOREST ONE STATE THIS STATE CALIFORNIA IMPORTS HALF. SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ OR ANNUALLY HIGHLIGHTED BY THE U. S. STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS GROUPS LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL FOR THEIR DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES. WE IMPORT FIFTY TWO MILLION WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN CALIFORNIA IMPORTS FIFTY TWO MILLION BARRELS OF OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT WERE BEING GAY OR PART OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH. WOMEN DON'T DRIVE AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE IN TORTURE IS USED AS A PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES. ALL THIS IMPORTED OIL BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA BY SIX HUNDRED TANKER SHIPS. EVERY SINGLE YEAR THESE TANKER SPEW MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE EVERY YEAR WITH BUNKER FUEL THAT THEY CONSUME AND THE POWER THAT THEY NEED TO OFFLOAD THE SOIL. I UNDERSTAND THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS ENERGY- SEE INTER ON THIS COMMITTEE SEE ENERGY DIFFERENT THAN I DO. BUT TODAY AND FOR THE C. BUT FORESEEABLE FUTURE CALIFORNIANS ARE CONSUMING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. THAT'S BECAUSE OIL TODAY IS USED FOR MORE THAN JUST GAS THAT MOST PEOPLE PUT IN THEIR CARS. MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND EVERYDAY PRODUCTS ARE MADE FOR PETROLEUM SUCH ISSUES. PHONES TOOTHBRUSHES. VISIT WINE PLASTIC LINERS THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH AND HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS BECAUSE TOOTHBRUSHES I GLASSES HEART VALVES AND DISPOSAL SPITZ DISPOSABLE BUT DIAPERS. ARE ALSO A BY PRODUCT OF PETROLEUM. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT INC OIL THERE'S A ORGANIZATION HYPO A LEASE IN MY DISTRICT THAT 85% OF WHAT'S PRODUCED FROM THAT LEASE PRODUCES IN COIL THAT MEANS ANYTHING THAT'S PRINTED ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CARDBOARD BOX. MEMBERS IT TAKES FIFTY OR SEES ME THIRTY FIVE GALLONS OF OIL TO TAKE THAT TO MAKE TIRES ON A PREVIOUS AND EVEN MORE TO MAKE THE PLASTICS THE WIRE INSULATION AND OTHER CAR PARTS. THAT REQUIRE OIL EVEN IN A FULLY ELECTRIC VEHICLE. MUCH OF THE OIL WE IMPORT COULD BE REPLACED BY CALIFORNIANS IN STATE PRODUCERS PROVIDING CALIFORNIA JOBS IF WE WERE ALLOWED TO EXPAND PRODUCTION. THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCER OPERATES UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY RULES IN THE IN THE WORLD. OIL IN MY DISTRICT KERN COUNTY. WHICH PRODUCES 70% OF THE STATE'S FOSSIL FUELS. IS EXTRACTED FROM WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY A DESERT THERE'S NO AMAZON RAIN FORESTS BEING DESTROYED AND JOBS ARE CREATED IN THE INDUSTRY AVERAGING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S ALMOST TWICE THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA SALARY. THESE EMPLOYEES GET EXCELLENT BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL. SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN WHEN SIMPLY IMPLORE THE LEGISLATURE TO PROHIBIT THE IMPORT OF CRUDE OIL INTO CALIFORNIA IF THE SOURCE OF THE OIL IS A FOREIGN NATION THAT IS DEMONSTRATED. THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA WHICH INPUT IMPRISONS AND BEATS AND HANGS. ANYONE IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY WHICH DOESN'T EVEN ALLOW WOMEN TO VOTE OR DRIVE OR A FOREIGN NATION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THAT ARE LOWER THAN THOSE OF CALIFORNIA. THE MEASURE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE CAL JIM TO REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE THE AMOUNT OF PARTICULAR MATTER CARBON IT'S RELEASED INTO THE AIR ON OIL TANKER SHIPS AND EMISSIONS. IN AN EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE AIR QUALITY IMPACT OF THIS STATE'S DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND HOW WE TRANSPORT THAT OIL TO THE STATE. LET ME SHOW YOU A KEY FEW QUICK EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS. PERMISSION TO USE A PROPER. PERMISSION GRANTED WITH RECOGNIZING ARE VERY LIMITED TIME VERY LIMITED TIME THIS IS JUST TWO MONTHS AGO A PIPELINE BURST IN THE KOCHER RIVER IN ECUADOR SPILLING SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BARRELS OF OIL THIS BILL CONTAMINATED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE METERS AND PROTECT A PROTECTED NATIONAL. PARK IN POLLUTED RIVER WITH THE INDIGENOUS TRIBES LIVE AND DO THEIR LAUNDRY AND DRINK THAT WATER. WE PAY FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THIS IS INDIGENOUS TRIBES THAT CONSISTENTLY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE ECUADORIAN GOVERNMENT OVER THE LACK OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THESE INDIGENOUS INDIANS HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE ECUADORIAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP BULLDOZING DOWN. OUR RAIN FOREST. THIS IS A SPILL ON THIS POSTER WITH HUNDRED FIFTEEN OIL SPILLS RECORDED IN ECUADOR IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RECORDS BILLS WE HAVE SEEPAGE IS IN A NATURAL FLOW BUT THERE IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSED. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN ECUADOR THAT WE PAY FOR GETS BROUGHT INTO THIS STATE AGAIN ECUADOR. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN A DAMAGED PIPELINE BECAUSE EIGHT THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL TO SPILL INTO THE AMAZON RAINFOREST. NOT AND KNOW THAT THERE'S LESS SURROUNDINGS IN THE JUNGLE AND THAT THESE INDIGENOUS INDIANS WHERE WE PRODUCE WORK WE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCED OIL IS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A TYPICAL KERN COUNTY OIL. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL IS PRODUCED YOU CAN SEE THERE'S NO TROPICAL RAINFOREST THERE'S NO INDIGENOUS INDIANS. THE BARRELS OF OIL CAN BE EXTRACTED SAFELY UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY PROCESSES IN THE WORLD. WHERE SHOULD CALIFORNIA GET ITS OIL KERN COUNTY OR ECUADOR. THESE ARE JUST A FEW HEADLINES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HERE'S A COUPLE OF ARTICLES SATELLITE IMAGES THROUGH THE AMAZON RAINFOREST IS HURTLING TOWARDS THE TIPPING POINT. DISASTER BURST PIPELINE SPREE'S CRUDE OIL INTO THE F. ECUADORIAN AMAZON RAIN FOREST ANNUALLY OCEAN CROSSING TANKERS AMID A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TONS OF CO TWO. IRAQ'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS MARRED BY THE WIDESPREAD REUSS A USE OF TORTURE FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY SAUDI ARABIA'S HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS ARE NOT GOING AWAY ACCORDING TO BBC NEWS. COLLEAGUES I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE COUNTRIES THAT PROVIDE OIL FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT WE CONSUME EVERY SINGLE DAY. ARE A DISASTER AND THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS IN THIS STATE THAT ALLOW PURCHASING OF THAT OIL TO DESTROY OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT PRODUCING IT HERE IN THE MOST DAVIS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REGULATORY PROCESSES. THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD- IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE. CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE READY TO MEET THAT DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIA OIL MORE THAN A THOUSAND DRILLING PERMITS CURRENTLY SIT AT CAL JAM ALONG WITH FIFTY FIVE YOU I SEEK PERMITS THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR OVER FOUR YEARS- BELIEVE THESE PERMITS WOULD EXPAND PRODUCTION IN THE STATE. REDUCE OUR FOREIGN IMPORTS GENERATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH PAYING JOBS IMPROVE OUR STATE'S ENERGY SECURITY AND DONE AND AGAIN UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. THE QUESTION I'M ASKING YOU TODAY'S IF WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND THE STATE'S CURRENT ENERGY POLICY. IS SENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERSEAS TO SUPPORT GOVERNMENTS THAT DON'T AGREE WITH. YOUR CONSISTENT WITH YOU ARE ARE THEY CONSISTENT WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL STANDARDS AND VALUES. SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN WOULD START A PROCESS TO BRING BACK TO CALIFORNIA THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT SHARE OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES ARE RESPECT THE ENVIRONMENT. BEFORE WE MOVED TO MY WITNESSES I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THEIR STAFF FOR THE FEEDBACK ON THIS BILL. AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS CAL JIM IS NOT THE AIR QUALITY REGULATOR- MODELLER IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE A LINK PROVIDED FOR THEIR INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED ON THE WEBSITE. THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION OF OIL IMPORTED IN THE STATE AND I BELIEVE THAT AMENDMENT TO ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS- I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT WITH MEDIA HAIR TESTIFY HERE TODAY- FOR SB THIRTEEN NINETEEN. IS THE MAYOR OF TAFT AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED IN THE OIL INDUSTRY- FOR SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS AND SHAUN WHELAN TINE WITH CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISTER MIRACLE YOU'RE ON THE LINE OR OR YOU'RE YOU'RE HERE IN PERSON SO. RECOGNIZING THE LATE HOUR OF DO APPRECIATE MAKING THE TRIP. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND SENATORS THANK YOU SENATOR GROW FOR BRINGING THIS STUFF TO LIVE WHERE WE SPEND OUR MONEY SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHO WE ARE. RESULT DECISIONS FOR ALL DECISIONS HAVE LOCAL IMPLICATIONS AND THAT IS TRUE ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY. SO SHE'S ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HUMAN IMPACTS OVERSEAS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING SO IT'S TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY WHAT ARE POLICIES DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BY INCREASING THE COST OF ALL FORMS OF ENERGY. AS A MATTER OF EXAMPLE. INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA YOU LIVE HERE YOU PAY A DOLLAR A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE PER GALLON FOR EVERY GALLON OF GAS AND DIESEL COMPARED TO EVERY STATE THAT BORDERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU PAY BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. FOR EVERY KILOWATT HOUR OF ENERGY AS YOU DO IF YOU LIVE IN ANY STATE BORDERING. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIRTY CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE OF THOSE THIRTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE ABOUT 36% LIVE NEAR OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL THEY ARE HANGING ON. BY THEIR FINGERNAILS. THE UNNECESSARY INCREASED COST OF THOSE CRITICAL FORMS OF ENERGY. ARE GOING TO DRIVE THEM BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL 36% THAT'S FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY WITH 40% OR FORTY TWO OR FORTY FOUR PERCENT. WE DON'T NEED THAT THAT IS NOT NECESSARY. AND AS FAR AS THE JUST TRANSITION I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THOSE FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WOULD THINK DRIVING THEM DEEPER INTO POVERTY. IS VERY JUST THAT ALL. MISSTATED CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF ENERGY AND WE HAVE THE TALENT. THE THOUSAND PLUS PERMITS ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE OR DELAYED MOSTLY OF THEM ARE FOR INFIELD DRILLING THAT MEANS GOING IN AND DRILLING ADDITIONAL WELLS. LIKE IN THAT PICTURE SHOULDN'T CENTER GROVE SHOWED YOU SO THESE ARE NEW WELLS ON EXISTING OIL FIELDS IN KNOWN RESERVOIRS. THAT WOULD BE DRILLED USING- PERFECTED TECHNIQUES BY PROFESSIONALS AND AS WELL AS THE OIL COMING OUT THERE WILL GOING IN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE ITS WAY TO MARKET IT IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE. SAFEST MOST THE LEAST INTRUSIVE METHOD TO GET ADDITIONAL BARRELS OF OIL TO MARKET. ITS CALIFORNIA'S WAY OUT OF THE MESS YOU'LL HEAR THE PHRASE GLOBALLY AND THAT IS ENERGY POVERTY ENERGY POVERTY MEANS THE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR CRITICAL FORMS OF ENERGY. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN HERE WE CAN AVOID IT. I THANK THE CHAIR AND CENTERS FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU MR MAYOR OF TO TWO IN TWO MINUTES AND SOME TAKEN SO PLEASE BE BRIEF IF YOU DON'T MIND THIS ORDER MEMBERS. ON WALL. STROLLING ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S- SERVICE AND SUPPLY COMPANIES AND ROYALTY OWNERS MEMBERS THIS IS YOUR OIL INDUSTRY WE OPERATE UNDER THE REGIME THAT YOU HAVE CREATED AND VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE CREATED OVER YEARS WE DO IT RIGHT WE PRODUCE CRUDE OIL UNDER THE STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND WORKER PROTECTIONS ON PLANET EARTH. WE HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF YOUR IN STATE OIL PRODUCERS WE DON'T DO IT ECUADOR DOES WE DON'T LIVE LIKE SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ WE CAN PRODUCE MORE CRUDE RIGHT HERE UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORS AND WE OUGHT TO DO MORE I DO WANNA IN CLOSING POINT OUT TO THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HAS A SCIENTIFIC GROUP REPORT YOU ALL OUGHT TO READ AND IT SAYS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

NOBODY ELSE FIGURE OUT OKAY- I'M SEEN ON OTHERS IN THE ROOM WILL BRING BACK TO THE DIETS AND I'LL JUST SAY BRIEFLY. PRESHEAF THE POINT MADE ABOUT AN OIL IMPORT EMISSIONS AND- TAKING THE FIRST AMENDMENT RECOGNIZING THAT ARE THE AUTHORS NOT INTERESTED IN REMOVING SECTION ONE ITS ENTIRETY THE COMMITTEE. DEVELOPED THE- THE BED A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO NOT STRIKE IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE- THAT SITTING BEFORE YOU HERE- IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE STATE ENERGY RESEARCH CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. UNDER FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT EXPORT OIL AND IDENTIFIED ITS WEBSITE THE COUNTRIES WITH DEMONSTRATE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AS DOCUMENTED BY THE- US DEPARTMENT. OF STATE OR BY HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS- I WOULD I WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON. BOTH THAT AMENDMENT AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT- OR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. SO THE MOTION FROM SENATOR- SENATOR EGGMAN COMMENTER QUESTIONS ON AROUND I MEAN I THINK YOU MAY LET'S AGREE POINTS- SENATOR I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENT- THAT YOU'RE OFFERING BOTH ADD SOME- COULD TRUTH TO THE COMMUNITY DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW TELL HIM IT'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE IT TO. TO DEAL WITH THE SUN- AIR QUALITY ISSUES WHICH YOU SAID YOURSELF CENTER AND THEN IT ALSO. MAKES THE- THE BILL CONSTITUTIONAL- BUT STILL GETS THE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES EVEN RAISING ABOUT THE VERY TROUBLING HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD- THAT EXISTS IN SO MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT. WERE IMPORTING OIL FROM SO- I THINK THAT- I'LL SUPPORT THE THEM THE BILL AS AS- MOVED OKAY. ZANIMA THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW AS CENTER GROVE YOU AND I'VE HAD AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND THE ONLY THING I WANT TO GO ON RECORD YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE IS A CALL COMMENT MADE ABOUT OUR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT THEY'RE NOT IN KERN AND I JUST WANTED TO GO ON RECORD THAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A LOT OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND THEY NO LONGER OWN THEIR LAND- AND SO- WHAT WE ARE SEEN IN ONE COUNTRY- IS DIFFERENT TO- HERE BUT BUT THE FACT THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AT ONE. POINT THEIR LAND WAS ALSO A DECIMATED I THINK JUST NEEDS TO GO ON RECORD- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND I THINK ALL YOUR VISUALS ARE VERY KEY IN- HIGHLIGHTING WHAT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE AT ANY PART OF THE GLOBE WHEN THIS BILL LOOKS LIKE THAT IT WILL STILL BE PROBLEMATIC IN KERN COUNTY IN ANY OTHER COUNTY OR IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. SO WITH THAT COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. LATER CLOSE I APPRECIATE THAT SIR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA- THERE WAS NO OFFENSE MEANT TO INDIGENOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD LOST THEIR PROPERTY- OBVIOUSLY. WITH THE TRIBES THAT I REPRESENT THEIR TRYING TO REGAIN THEIR PROPERTY- I DO A- TAKE. A LITTLE OFFENSE TO THE FACT THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN ECUADOR. YOU THINK IS EQUALLY TO WHAT HAPPENS HERE BECAUSE IT IS IT IS NOT. AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL GOING TO FRESH WATER STREAMS IN ECUADOR WE PURCHASED THAT. OIL FROM ECUADOR TO CALIFORNIA. WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE A- SEEPAGE- THE LATEST WHEN WE HAD THE GOT NATIONAL RECOGNITION OR NATIONAL ATTENTION. WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HALF OF A WALMART. AND IT WAS ON DRY BEDS AND DRYLY QUIDS IN A DESERT AREA. AGAIN ON THE SAME. AREA WHERE ALL THESE OTHER WELLS ARE IN THE WE GET A PERMIT LIKE THE PERMITS THAT ARE WAITING ON THE ONE THOUSAND ONE PERMITS. THEY'RE ASKING TO DRILL A WELL RIGHT HERE. AND THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS SEE WHAT PROCESS. DO AN ESTIMATED. IT EXAMINATION ON THE WATER AQUIFER IT IS WITHIN THIS WHOLE AREA. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M JUST TRYING TO DO IS BRING REALITY TO HOW WE PRODUCE CALIFORNIA OIL HERE FOR CALIFORNIANS. WITH FOR CALIFORNIA JOBS. I'M HERE. AT THE BEST AND MOST HIGHEST QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS ANYWHERE. WHAT HAPPENS IN ECUADOR AND OTHER COUNTRIES DOES NOT HAPPEN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DO ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU SAID EARLIER IF THERE'S NOT A BILL THERE'S NOT A CONVERSATION. YOU AND I HAVE IT A DISTANCE OF CONVERSATIONS. ON THE FIXES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA OIL INDUSTRY ALONG WITH THE CHAIR. ABOUT THE INEQUITY ON- THE WAY THAT WERE FOUND IN ABANDONED WELLS ARE TAKING CARE OF. AND I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE A BILL AND YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT THEN THOSE THINGS CAN COME TO REALITY. AND. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT. ARE MAJOR PRODUCE LIKE ARE SMALLER BUT- ADVICE PERCENT OR SMALLER PRODUCERS ARE NOT EQUALLY TREATED LIKE ARE MAJOR PRODUCERS WHEN IT COMES TO ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS. THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES IN OUR STATE THAT WE DO FACE. NONE OF THESE THAT I SHOWED ON THIS BOARD OF WHAT HAPPENS IN ECUADOR IS SOMETHING THAT WE FACE HERE. BECAUSE WE DO THIS UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL STRICT IN THE MOST STRICTEST ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY PROCESSES. IN THE WORLD AND WE SHOULD PRODUCE CALIFORNIA OIL HERE. UNDER THOSE RESTRICTIONS WHERE WE OVERSEE IT. AND PROVIDE CALIFORNIA JOBS AND STOP THIS NONSENSE COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I THINK YOU. FOR AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MADE THAT COMMENT THAT WITH THE BILL THERE'S ALWAYS A CONVERSATION. SO THE MOTION IS- IS TO PASS IF YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE MORE THING YES USUALLY BILLS ARE THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG. MINUS TWO PAGES THE DIGEST IS A ONE AND A HALF PAGES. THE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE IS A NINETEEN LINE. I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT THAT STRIKES LAW. THE IN IN ITS ENTIRETY LINES ONE THROUGH THIRTEEN AND ADDS AN ADDITIONAL SECTION TO MAKE THE BILL PROBABLY SIX LINES LONG. FOR FIVE LINES LONG SO. JUST TO BE CLEAR THE MOTION COMMENT YEAH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THE MOTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THOUGH JUST TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT EVERYONE'S VOTING ON IS. AMENDMENT ONE WHICH IS IN THE ANALYSIS THE LINK ON THE WEBSITE FOR CAL GENESIS WITH AIR QUALITY EMISSIONS AROUND TRANSPORTATION OF OIL IMPORT INTO THE STATE. BUT AMENDMENT TO WILL NOT BE TO REMOVE SECTION ONE ITS ENTIRETY BUT INSTEAD SUPPLANT THAT WE HAVE THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU SAID THAT WAS THE MOTION MADE- BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT- YOU'VE CLOSED.
