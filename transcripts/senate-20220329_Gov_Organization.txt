THE CIVICALLY SB NINE AWAIT WILL INCREASE TO REPRESENTATION AT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF EDUCATION BY ESTABLISHING A THIRTEEN MEMBER. YOUTH ADVISORY COMMISSION UNDER STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY SIX MILLION STUDENTS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES THAT COULD IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER ONLY ONE STUDENT IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTING ALL SIX MILLION STUDENTS ON THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND IT'S CHALLENGING FOR THAT ONE STUDENT TO ADEQUATELY REPRESENT ALL THE STUDENTS WHO UNIQUE NEEDS. THAT IS WHY THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS BILL WILL ENSURE STUDENTS COME FROM EVERY REGION AND ARE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR PASSION EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN JUST A GREAT. THIS WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO SPEAK TO A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH BUT VIOLENCE BULLYING OTHER ISSUES AFFECTING STUDENTS. NOW MORE THAN EVER IS IMPORTANT WE ELEVATE THE VOICES OF STUDENTS THROUGH SB NINE AWAIT SO THAT WE CAN POWER THEM TO SOLVE THE ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM.

WELL NOW MOVES TO THE ITEM FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB NINE ELEVEN BY CENTER GLAZER. CENTER GLAZER YOU MAY BEGIN OR YOU WANT TO GO BACK FIVE. EITHER WAY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL SENATE BILL NINE ONE ONE. IT'S A VERY APT NUMBER BECAUSE SB NINE ONE ONE RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY A REAL EMERGENCY AND EMERGENCY IS THE THREAT POSED TO OUR DEMOCRACY BY MISINFORMATION OUR FREE SPEECH AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE BEING OVERWHELMED BY. CHEAP SPEECH. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD LIARS AND FRAUDSTERS WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO MISINFORM AND USE MISINFORMATION TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT IN THE INTERNET AGE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND TWO METHODS OF SPREADING MISINFORMATION HAVE BECOME SO CHEAP. THAT ANYONE CAN DO IT. GOOD OLD FASHIONED FACT BASED NEWS MEANWHILE IS NOT CHEAP. MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TO HIRE REPORTERS AND EDITORS AND NOW WEB DESIGNERS AND THEY HAVE TO SELL ADVERTISING AND SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SUPPORT THOSE COSTS. THE RESULT UNFORTUNATELY IS THAT CHEAP SPEECH HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD THAN FREE SPEECH MISINFORMATION DON'T JUST SPREAD LIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THEY ALL THEY ALSO DELIBERATELY UNDERMINE OUR INSTITUTIONS FROM GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA TO THE MEDIA. ALL IN AN EFFORT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT NONE OF THESE GROUPS CAN BE TRUSTED. NATIONALLY MORE THAN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED NEWSPAPERS HAVE FAILED ALMOST 25% OF THE NINE THOUSAND NEWSPAPERS THAT WERE PUBLISHED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD THEIR OWN NEWSPAPER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND NOW HAVE NO ORIGINAL REPORTING WHATSOEVER IN PRINT OR DIGITALLY HAS GROWN TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITIES. NEWS DESERT'S. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN A 24% DECLINE IN NEWSPAPERS FROM FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS CIRCULATION HAS DROPPED BY NEARLY HALF FROM THIRTEEN MILLION TO SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION. THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. SIX TO HELP CLOSE THAT GAP. THAT THIS DECLINE HAS CREATED A GAP THAT INCREASINGLY IS FILLED BY MISINFORMATION. IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO LOCAL MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS AND JOURNALISTS TO SUPPORT COVERAGE OF LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS THE GRANT TO BE DIRECTED TO PLACES WERE CREDIBLE NEWS COVERAGE IS SCARCE. AND TO COMMUNITIES THAT TRADITIONAL MEDIA HAVE LONG IGNORED. ONE FOURTH OF THE GRANT MONEY WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR ETHNIC MEDIA. AND ONE FOURTH FOR MEDIA SERVING SMALL COMMUNITIES. AS SOME MIGHT QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A PROPER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT. BUT NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC TELEVISION AND RADIO AND OUR OWN STATE SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. SB NINE ONE ONE WOULD CREATE A FIFTEEN MEMBER BOARD WITH THE DIVERSE BIPARTISAN MEMBERSHIP. TO SOLICIT REVIEW AND APPROVE THE GRASS THE BOARD WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM CONSIDERING PARTISAN POLITICS IN ITS WAY INTO GRANT APPLICATIONS. AND THE BOARD COULD ALSO ACCEPT DONATIONS FROM PRIVATE SOURCES. INCLUDING NONPROFIT FOUNDATIONS AND USE THIS MONEY TO SUPPORT SUPPLEMENT IT'S PUBLIC MONEY. MEMBERS JAMES MADISON THE AUTHOR OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT CALLED OUR FREE PRESS ONE OF THE GREAT WALL WORKS OF LIBERTY. HE WAS RIGHT BUT TRAGICALLY TRAGICALLY THAT ALL WORK IS NOW CRUMBLING AND AS IT DOES OUR DEMOCRACY IS PUT IN PERIL WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BUTTRESS BOTH AND THAT'S WHAT SB NINE ONE ONE WOULD DO. BEFORE I CLOSED MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE ALL THE INPUT THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION YET THE MEDIA SERVICES AND COMMON CAUSE OF CALIFORNIA AND SOME OTHERS I'LL CONTINUE I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE OF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM SO WE CAN REFINE THE BILL I EVEN MORE THAN IT IS TODAY AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- I.% BOATS. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER- I BELIEVE YOU HAVE DERREN MACHEL. AND JESSICA GONZALEZ WHO ARE BOTH ON THE COASTLINE. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF MR MICHELLE YOU MAY BEGIN. HELLO GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I AM THERE ON THE SHELF PREIDENT AND CEO OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC MEDIA. I'M ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC TELEVISION A GROUP OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING STATIONS IN THE STATE. THE CPT IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SENATOR GLAZERS SB NINE ELEVEN ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBER STATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. PUBLIC BROADCASTING HAS LONG PRIDED ITSELF IN OUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE TRUST WORTHY EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIVE PROGRAMMING AVAILABLE TO OUR VIEWERS. ARE PDF MODEL IS TRUSTED NONPARTISAN CELEBRATES DEMOCRACY AND OFFERS QUALITY DIALOGUE AND REPORTS ON ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIANS. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAN CONFIDENTLY GO TO READ VIEW AND CONSUME FAIR AND ACCURATE INFORMATION TO FORMULATE EDUCATED POSITION THE PUBLIC THING THE TOUCH THEIR LIVES ON A DAILY BASIS. THAT'S WHY THE CPT WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THE INTRODUCTION OF SENATOR GLAZERS BILL IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE IN SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE AND SPECIALLY ON THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE THE CREATION OF A BOARD TO FUND PUBLIC INTEREST MEDIA WOULD ALLOW LOCAL TV STATIONS JOURNALIST. SMALL NEWSPAPERS AND OTHERS TO WRITE AND PRODUCE TRUSTED CONTENT THAT IS GROUNDED IN COVERING THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE BILL WILL ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION ACROSS MEDIA TYPES FOR EXAMPLE HERE AT- OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC MEDIA GROUP WE ENGAGE WITH SMALL NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE REGION TO BOLSTER LOCAL NEWS OUTRAGE BUT AS YOU MAY KNOW FUNDING FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING HAS NEVER BEEN COMPLETELY ROBUST IN THIS BILL COULD ENABLE US TO CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT STATIONS LIKE. SAN DIEGO PDF IS PERFORMING. WITH THEIR NIGHTLY NEWS PROGRAM. OR STATION TO CURRENTLY HAVE THIS OF PROGRAMMING LONG AN INFORMATIVE NEWS PROGRAM USING GRANT MONEY AUTHORIZED BY THE BILL. CPT IS GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH OUR GROUP AND WE ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THAT'S THE NINE ELEVEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER LOST. LAWSHALL MISTER DOLLARS FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DODD SENATOR GLAZERS COMMITTEE MEMBER THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE ON THE COAST CEO OF FREE PRESS ACTION EVERY TRANSACTION WE ADVANCE JOURNALISM POLICY TO SUPPORT A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DEMOCRACY WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND NUMBERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M BASED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR THE PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC MEDIA OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE U. S. HAS LOST OVER HALF THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS COVERING STATE AND LOCAL BE. CALIFORNIA'S LAW 25% OF THE NEWSPAPER AND TOTAL NEW CIRCULATION OF DROPPED BY 50% THE DEFAMATION OF LOCAL NEWS HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMS THE POOR PEOPLE OF COLOR RURAL COMMUNITY AND IMMIGRANT. FOR MISSING LOCAL JOURNALISM THAT HELPS US MAKE GOOD CHOICES ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM HEALTH AND SAFETY HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND A MOM I STRUGGLE TO FIND RELIABLE INFORMATION WHEN MY KIDS RETURN TO SCHOOL INDEPENDENT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOURCE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ITSELF WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD PRINCIPAL AND TEACHERS OFTEN SHARING CONFLICTING INFORMATION. THERE WAS NO INDEPENDENT REPORTING ON WEATHER'S SCHOOLROOMS WERE PROPERLY VENTILATED WHERE TO DISTRICT WHICH FOLLOWING STATE AND LOCAL PROTOCOL. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTORS WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE BOARD LAW ENFORCEMENT AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR CITY COUNCIL AT OUR SCHOOL TOWARDS IN THAT INFORMATION. AND IT'S OBVIOUS THE CORPORATE MEDIA WILL NOT BE BACK GOOD JOURNALISM ISN'T THE ONLY PROFITABLE AND EVEN IF LOCAL TV STATIONS AND MAXWELL THEY CONTINUE TO LAY OFF LOCAL REPORTERS. PUBLIC INVESTMENT IS A GREAT WAY TO CONFRONT THE COLLAPSE OF LOCAL MEDIA AND THE RISE OF DISINFORMATION THIS BILL COULD NOT ONLY INVIGORATE THE CIVIC LIFE OF CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO SERVE AS AN INNOVATIVE MODEL FOR OTHERS EIGHT. IN PARTICULAR FREE PRESS ACTION IN STRONG FAVOR OF THE BILL CALLED AND SUPPORTING. ETHNIC AND COMMUNITY JOURNALISM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WITH THE ON THE PROVISION.

I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THANK YOU MR LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR ON SB NINE ELEVEN AND I'VE ASKED TO BE A CO AUTHOR- THIS BILL TRULY WILL HELP THE INDUSTRY WE CAN ALL LOOK BACK YEARS UPON YEARS FROM WHEN PERHAPS SOME OF US WERE YOUNG CHILDREN AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY DELIVER OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER IN EVERY COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE I GREW UP HAD A LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND IF AS WE HEARD- THE DEMISE OF ONE AFTER THE OTHER AFTER THE OTHER. CHAU OUR COMMUNITIES NEED THE SUPPORT IN THIS BILL NINE ELEVEN WILL BRING THAT BACK AND TO HELP THESE LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THEY ARE BUSINESSES TO INFORM US EACH AND EVERY DAY- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOT ONLY IN THE WORLD IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I'M HOPING THAT- THE BOARD WILL- ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK OF MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO JOURNALISM AND- PUBLIC MEDIA SO I HARDLY- I JUST- BUT CITED ABOUT THE BILL. AND WHEN IT COMES UP FOR VOTE I WILL VOTE YEAH HI AND I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE WILL TOO THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR NIELSEN. WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE. THE NOBLE INTENT OF THIS. I SUPPORT AND I UNDERSTAND I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS BEING ATTENTIVE TO AN ISSUE THERE'S BEEN LONG DEVELOPING. I WATCHED OVER THE YEARS FOR THE LOCAL HOMETOWN PAPERS DIED. I WATCHED OVER THE YEARS WERE. EVEN LARGE NEWSPAPERS LIKE THE SANTA ROSA PRESS DEMOCRAT. WHEN INDIVIDUAL WORK CHOIR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES I SAID LOCAL. INPUT IS DEAD. AND THAT'S HAPPENED ALL OVER SO WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT I AM ALWAYS WARY. OF GIVING MORE POWER TO GOVERNMENT. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GIVING HUGE POWER THE GOVERNMENT. GRANTS MONEY. THESE PAPERS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT. AND GOVERNMENT AS A SUBTLE AND NOT SO SUBTLE WAYS OF IMPOSING ITS WILL ON THOSE WHO ARE. DEPENDING ON IT IN THIS CASE IT WILL BE BE DEPENDING. I BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO SAVE OUR HOMETOWN NEWSPAPERS I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT VESTING TOO MUCH AUTHORITY. AND POWER FISCAL SO I WILL BE A NOBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR BORCHERS. THIS IS A AREA THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT- DOES INDEED CAPTURE IMAGINATION- YOU KNOW I'VE HAD- DISCUSSIONS- FORMALLY AND INFORMALLY ABOUT THE DEMISE OF- SMALL PAPERS AND SMALL OUTLETS- JUST BY WAY OF REFERENCE- WHEN I FIRST EMERGED ON THE POLITICAL SCENE. IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS THE FRESNO BEE WAS THE DOMINANT NEWS OUTLET. NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT IT BEING COVERED EVERYTHING WAS COVERED AND THEY HAD A SIGN REPORTERS- IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE AREA. AND AT THIS POINT- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GONE THROUGH THE TRANSITION LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS WHERE IT REALIZE IT HAS RELIED A LOT ON ASSOCIATED PRESS OR WITHIN THE MCCLATCHY FAMILY OF MATERIAL THAT IS THAT IS PRODUCED. AND SO WITHOUT A DOUBT THE DEMISE OF LOCAL CONTENT OUR LOCAL INSIGHT ARE WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW- UNDERGIRDS- YOU KNOW. THE TYPE REPORTING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- WITHOUT WITH WITHOUT GOING TO ANY MORE DETAIL WE KNOW SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. AS I LOOK AT THE BILL HERE IT I ALMOST WANT TO. JUST THROW OUT AN IDEA FOR A FRIENDLY. AMENDMENT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER ALONG THE WAY. BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS NOT JUST LOCAL CONTACT. IT'S ALSO ETHICAL REPORTING. MOVING INTO THE REALM OF WHAT THE OLD COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM WHICH WOULD PUT OUT AS THE TENETS OF ETHICAL JOURNALISM DISPASSIONATE REPORTING. DOUBLE SOURCING. EDITOR IN PEER REVIEW OF CONTENT FOUR FIVE OTHERS THAT GO INTO THIS I THINK TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WORK IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO WANT THIS COMMISSIONER THIS BODY. TO PUT FORWARD IN IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE THE NEWS MARKET PLACE. WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE BECAUSE EVERY TOM DICK AND HARRY ON INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK NOW PUTS THEMSELVES OUT AS HAVING A PRESS CREDENTIAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS. AND WE'VE SEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LACK OF RESPECT THAT FOLKS HAVE- ALLOWED FOR THOSE WHO WERE APPROPRIATELY SKILLED OR EDUCATED. OR EXPERIENCE IN CERTAIN DISCIPLINES- THAT THEIR OPINION. IS ON PAR WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS NO BACKGROUND IN THAT-RESPECTIVE AREA THIS DRIVES ME MAD. SO HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS IT'S NOT JUST PUTTING MONEY INTO LOCAL CONTENT IT'S TURNING WAY THE TICKET IN THE. IT IS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT YOUR COMMENTS PROVOKED CENTER EXACTLY. BUT LISTEN I KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL I'VE BEEN CERTAINLY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IN ITS GONE VIRTUALLY NOWHERE BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MICROCOSM CALIFORNIA YOU NOW ARE IN A POSITION THROUGH THIS BILL OR SOME VARIATION OF IT AS IT EVOLVES TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING TRULY SIGNIFICANT. CAN I ASK THE AUTHOR THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY. WOULD USE WOULD YOU CONSIDER INCORPORATING. A RULES AND IN STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION. ROSS SAYS COMPONENT TO A BILL LIKE THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO CHANGE- CALIFORNIA REPORTING ESPECIALLY LOCAL. THE CHAIR IF I MAY PLEASE WELL I CERTAINLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FRESNO. AND I'M IN AGREEMENT NOW- I DON'T RECALL WHETHER WE'VE WRITTEN IT INTO THE BILL ITSELF BUT I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO AN AMENDMENT THAT. MAKES IT CLEAR THAT- THAT THERE IS A- IT THERE IS THERE ARE JOURNALISTS NATIONAL JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY- THAT- AS WE I ASK PEOPLE TO ABIDE BY ETHICAL- ENCOUNTERS IN OUR ELECTIONS. THERE IS A SIMILAR STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN SET AND I I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO INCORPORATE THOSE ARE DIRECT THE BOARD MEMBER. WE'RE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE MAKING THESE DECISIONS THIS BILL SET UP A BOARD AN INDEPENDENT BOARD TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY I CREATE A STANDARD PERHAPS THE EXISTING NATIONAL STANDARD ON JOURNALISTIC AND YOU KNOW INTEGRITY. I SOMEHOW- AN OBLIGATION FOR THEM TO FOLLOW BUT THAT'S WORK ON THAT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT YOU'RE EXPRESSING. THAT AND BE THE SAME THING THAT I WOULD WANT TO ACHIEVE. BECAUSE BY THAT. WELCOME TO HELP HERE IF I MAY UM. THIS IS THAT RARE OPPORTUNITY I THINK A BILL LIKE THIS. IS JUST HALF WAY THERE AND I RESPECT ENORMOUSLY THE AUTHOR- THE WORK YOU YOU DO AND NOT JUST THE SOME OF THE OTHERS. THIS REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE. THAT COMPONENT- THE END THROUGH A BOARD. OF THIS SORT THAT WOULD BE THE VENUE FOR THE CREATION OF THIS TYPE OF RIGOROUS SCRUTINY AS- CREDENTIALING AUTHORITY. THANK YOU- CENTER CALM UNDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- BRINGING THIS BILL. FORWARD ALTHOUGH THE BILL NUMBER KIND OF ALWAYS GIVES ME A LITTLE PAUSE- I WANT TO JUST EXPRESS THAT I AM LIKE THIS BILL AND I APPLAUD ITS GOAL TO REALLY SUPPORT CALIFORNIA LOCAL SMALL AND ETHNIC MEDIA OUTLETS- I ALSO FEEL COMPELLED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO INDEPENDENT JOURNALISM IN THE LOCAL PAPERS WE KNOW THAT I BELIEVE THAT JOURNALISTS ARE EAST CENTRAL WORKERS AND THEY ARE UNDER ATTACK AS IS THE TRUTH AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE WORKING TO PROTECT FREE PRESS FREE SPEECH AND OUR JOURNALISTS WHO ARE DOING THE HARD WORK OF TRYING TO GIVE US INFORMATION. I HAVE TO EITHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POSE TO THE CHAIR. JUST FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THIS AUTHOR AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I KNOW THEY DO NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE BILL BUT THE MAIN ALLOW FOR SOME DISCUSSION AND INCORPORATION IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE PANEL AND THE ADVISORY- PANEL THAT'S- A PROPOSED TO BE FORMED. SO THE FIRST IS THERE A WAY TO INCLUDE OR TO CONSIDER- FOUR TWO MAYBE CLARIFY. THAT THE LOCAL PAPERS. ARE INDEED LOCAL AND COMMUNITY OUTLETS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT- THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE. THE LOCAL PRESS OR THE COMMUNITY PAPER IS NOT REALLY FROM THE COMMUNITY SO MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TO ARTICULATE THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S A GRANT COMPONENT AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GRANT DOLLARS ARE GOING TO LOCAL COMMUNITY PAPERS OR MEDIA OUTLETS THAT ARE SHARING LOCAL NEWS SO THAT WAS JUST ONE THOUGHT AND THEN I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE PAST AND THIS BILL. IS NOT DEALING WITH THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I'M GOING TO BRING UP. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT CITIES ARE REQUIRED. BY LAW TO PAY TO POST IN PUBLIC NEWSPAPERS. AND WE KNOW THAT. THAT PAYMENTS- IS REALLY IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL FOR OUR LOCAL PRINT NEWSPAPERS THAT ARE OFTENTIMES STRUGGLING TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW HAT THERE ARE ONLINE OUTLETS AS WELL. AND THE LAW DOES SAY PRINT NEWSPAPERS BUT IS THERE MAY BE ALSO WAY IN SORT OF HOW THIS CONTINUES TO GET FRAMED AN ARTICULATE TO MAYBE CONSIDER ALLOWING FOR THOSE PAPERS FOR THOSE MDIA OUTLETS THAT HAVE BOTH A PRINT AND ONLINE- PRESENCE. THEN MAYBE ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE POSTING TO HAPPEN AND I ONLY SHARE THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS INCREDIBLY INTERESTED IN LOCAL JOURNALISM. AND EVERY TIME THERE'S A BILL THAT COMES UP THAT'S ON THIS ISSUE. I GET TONS OF CALLS AND SO I'VE BEEN- TRAINED TO GO TO FOLKS WHEN I GET A BILL. OF THIS NATURE AND SO I DID. AND I'M I'M ACTUALLY SHARING TWO QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE DISTRICT- I THINK HOPING FOR FEEDBACK OR FROM SOME SORT OF ENGAGEMENT FROM- THE LEGISLATURE N. TAG YOU'RE IT BECAUSE- THIS IS THE ONLY BILL SO FAR I'VE SEEN THAT DEALS WITH LOCAL PAPER SO. JUST TO THE CHAIR I HAVE THOSE TWO- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- FOR THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER.

GREAT LOCAL JOURNALISM AND HOW IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL IT IS BEEN IN THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH AS- THERE'S TRANSITIONS IN THAT WORLD WITH THAT WITH DIGITAL ONLINE. AS AS SHE SPEAKS UP- I AM OPEN TO TRYING O FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT LOCAL CERTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE LOCAL AND I'M OPEN TO ANY IDEAS THERE TO TRY TO. MANEUVER THROUGH THAT DIVERSITY OF MEDIA THAT WE DO HAVE LOCALLY OUT THERE- TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THAT BOARD SO THAT WHEN THEY THEY'VE- WE'VE AS YOU KNOW IN THIS BILL WE'VE CREATED SOME EXTRAORDINARY SET ASIDE SO THAT. THAT THEY'RE THEY THEY THEY MEET THAT PURPOSE AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO SEE THERE AS WELL- IN REGARD TO THE BROADER KIND- POINT OF- AT THE THAT POSTING. MANDATES CAN IS NOT A DIRECT ISSUE HERE- I SHARE HER- HER OUR INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT- AS THAT THE MEDIA HAS MODERNIZE THAT WE ALSO MODERNIZE OUR- RULES AND REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF POSTING BUT- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS EXACTLY THAT VEHICLE. DATA AYE AYES AYE WE BOTH COMMIT THE SAME PLACES THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM OR ELSE IT'S GOING TO DIE. AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DEPENDENT UPON IT OUR DEMOCRACIES DEPEND UPON IT SO WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU BUT- BEFORE YOU SPEAK CENTER WHO BOB BECKER. I RETHOUGHT- THERE WAS SOMEBODY UP IN THE GALLERY THAT WANTED TO SPEAK- AS A TWEEN AREA AND I SAID NO BUT- YOU KNOW. THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM KIND OF DICTATES OF WE'VE BEEN A SMALL ARC.

WILL IN EFFECT RJ PUTS THE STATE'S MONEY WORDS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT. REQUIRES OUR OWN. DEPARTMENTS DGS FOR OUR STATE OWNED VEHICLES THE FLEETS TO MOVE QUICKER TWO ZERO MISSION VIA. AS I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT INDICATES WE WILL NOT BE SELLING- ALSO FUEL POWERED VEHICLES- WITHIN A CERTAIN DATE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE HELPING THE TRANSFORMATION THE MARKET TRANSFORMATION. FOR OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE MORE PURCHASING UP THOSE VEHICLES THEN IT HELPS TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN IT HELPS TO STIMULATE MORE MODELS. AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY BENEFICIAL FOR US FROM BOTH THE CLIMATE PROTECTION POINT OF VIEW AND AN AIR QUALITY POINT OF VIEW SO WHAT SB TEN TEN DOES. IS IT HAS THE STATE'S ZERO EMISSION PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS IT MOVES THAT TO A 100% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX FOR LIGHT DUTY AND A 100% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY. AND I'D LIKE MY EXPERT. WITNESSES TO REPRESENT BILL MCGOVERN FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND READ OUT A STRING CAL START. OKAY THANK YOU US SENATOR- MR- WE GATHER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TODD- MEMBERS I'M BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN TEN. TRANSPORTATION IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF BOTH AIR AND CLIMATE POLLUTION. IN FACT VEHICLE POLLUTION KILLS MORE PEOPLE EVERY YEAR THAT VEHICLE ACCIDENTS DO. FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A PART OF THE SOLUTION WHICH IS GOING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE STATE HAS A VARIETY OF STANDARDS TO REQUIRE A TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION CARS BUSES AND TRUCKS. WE THINK THAT IT MAKES EXCELLENT SENSE FOR THE STATE TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE UP ITS OWN FLEET OF VEHICLES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA MEET MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. BY REQUIRING AT LEAST 50% OF NEW HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES PURCHASED BY THE STATE TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. GROWING TO A 100% OF NEW PURCHASES BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. AND ALSO MOVING THE STATE'S LIGHT DUTY FLEET 250% NEW PURCHASE IS BEING ZERO EMISSION. BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR REACHING A SIX. THERE VARIETY OF MODELS THAT CAN SERVE THESE NEEDS- AND ALL KNOW THAT OUR SUPPORT LETTER IS ALSO JOINED BY ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. B. Y. D. NORTH AMERICA. SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ALLIANCE FOR CLEAN ECONOMY. THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND.

THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION AND SERIES THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR GAVIN MISTER READ FEEL FREE TO BE YET. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT A SUNDAY AFTER CAL START HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY. THIS MEASURE BUILDS OFF A LONG HISTORY OF THE STATE USING ITS PURCHASING POWER TO HELP DRIVE AND IMPLEMENT THE VARIOUS POLICIES THE STATE HAS INTRODUCED OVER THE YEARS. IN PARTICULAR TRUCK GOING AND TAKING THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE STATE AND ITS FLEET. TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS AND SCALE UP THE INDUSTRY ULTIMATELY ALLOWING THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES TO BE CHEAPER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. FINALLY I WILL SAY THAT BASED ON OUR MATH WE TAKE WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY ALONE WILL DRIVE TWENTY THOUSAND NEW VEHICLES THEIR VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. AS FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SIR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CHAMBER UP ABOVE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I SEE ONE MORE. GOOD MORNING. HELLO I'M CYNTHIA SHALLOT A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIVISIBLE STATE STRONG. CAST OF COALITION OF OVER EIGHTY FIVE CHAPTERS ACROSS THOUSAND MEMBERS. I AM ACTIVE IN CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKGROUP BECAUSE WE THINK FIGHTING CLIMATE. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS IMPORTANT ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE WE HAVE. WITH A SPENT SOME TIME EVALUATING THE VARIOUS BILLS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED. AND I'M LEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT WE RECENTLY VOTED TO SELECT SB TEN TEN AS PRIORITY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL. NOT ONLY IS IT ESSENTIAL TO HELP CALIFORNIA REACH ITS NET ZERO EMISSION GOALS AND LIBERATE THE STATE FROM FOSSIL FUEL DEPENDENCY. BUT IT SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE NATION IN THE WORLD. ALSO THE STATE WILL SERVE AS A LEADER TO OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ON HOW TO ACTUALLY TRANSITION THEIR FLEETS TO ELECTRIC. I KNOW THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENCOUNTERED SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE FROM THEIR FLEET MANAGERS SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY FROM THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY OPERATIONS. WITH THIS BILL THE STATE CAN SHOW THE LOCALS HOW IT IS DONE WHAT MODELS CAN BE EFFICIENT AND WHICH ONES CAN MEET THEIR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE LOOPHOLE IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS EXCEPTIONS FOR THOSE VEHICLES THOSE VEHICLE PURCHASES. I HOPE THE PROCESS FOR EVALUATING THE USE OF EXCEPTIONS IS RIGOROUS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. A MODERATOR- IT'S TIME TO MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCE OR FIRST. WOULD YOU PROMPT INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN TEN.

MICROPHONE IS UP PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU CHAIR- JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. THE AUTHOR BY MAY- WHEN WE REFER TO A MEDIUM AND HEAVY VEHICLE FLEET. OF VEHICLES- ARE WE ALSO DOES THIS ALSO APPLY TO. BUY CALIFORNIA ENTITIES LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IN CALIFORNIA GUARD. PERMISSION TO RESPOND PLEASE THIS IS ONLY STATE PURCHASES IT IS NOT SCHOOL DISTRICT PURCHASES SO- IT IS PURELY THE PURCHASES OF STATE VEHICLE FLEETS BY DGS. WITH THAT INCLUDING CALIFORNIA GUARD. IT THE AGENCIES THAT IT WOULD INCLUDE OUR- THE HIGHWAY PATROL pREHABILITATION TRANSPORTATION FISHING WILDLIFE PARKS AND REC CONSUMER AFFAIRS I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE NATIONAL GUARD BUT I DON'T HAVE IT ON OUR LIST AS BEING ONE OF THE AGENCIES SO I AM THINKING NOT BUT I WILL MAKE SURE TO FIND OUT AND GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE. I'LL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY I'D I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL I REALLY LOOK TO THE STATE TO BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA AND WE HAVE POLICIES THAT WERE MAKING BUSINESSES STEP UP TO THE PLATE IN INVEST IN THE NEW GREEN ECONOMY IF YOU WILL FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT OUGHT TO WE OUGHT TO BE SETTING THE EXAMPLE I WILL SAY- WITHOUT. TOUCHING IT TO ANY SPECIFICS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A REAL I DON'T KNOW IF IT COULD BE PART OF THIS BILL A ROBUST. THE ROBUST STATIONS THAT REQUIRED THAT REALLY ALLOW VEHICLES PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT CALTRANS CHP WE'VE GOT WE CAN'T DEAL WITH YEAH LEVEL ONE LEVEL TWO PROBABLY THE LEVEL THREE CHARGERS THESE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY CHARTERS. I GET THE THUMBS UP FROM CENTER HERTZBERG THERE OKAY PERFECT- ANYBODY ELSE WISHING ON THIS ONE WHICH LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL THE BILL IS SILENT AROUND THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE CLEARLY IF THE STATE MOVES IN THIS DIRECTION IT WILL HAVE TO- HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OUR STATE FLEETS. ONCE THEY ARE SET UP WILL HAVE TO BE CHARGED AND- THE BENEFIT OF. AS HAS BEEN STATED NOT ONLY BY YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IS THAT THE GOOD THING OF. THE STATE LEADING BY EXAMPLE IS THAT NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE STATE IN A FLEET PURCHASE BUYS A LOT OF VEHICLES AT ONCE IT CAN NEGOTIATE A YOU KNOW A BETTER PRICE THAN YOU KNOW WE AS INDIVIDUALS. AND BY PURCHASING LARGE VOLUMES OF DESERVES IT DOES SEND OUT MARKET SIGNAL TO. TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE DEMAND. AND TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MODELS AS WELL AS INCREASING THE INVESTMENT IN CHARGING WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE CHARGING THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN USE ADDITIONALLY. SO I AM THAT'S CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND DIE WITH THAT I ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU CENTER SCARED WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB TEN TEN. CENTER ARCHULETA THANK YOU- THE BILL'S BEEN NEW BIKES- CENTER ARCHULETA THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DODD HI DONNA HI NIELSEN.

SEVEN TWO THREE ON SEVENTY THREE WILL PUT THAT ITEM ON CALL. WE WILL NOW- MOVED TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB ELEVEN NINETY BY SENATOR HERTZBERG. SENATOR HERTZBERG WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. I AM READY. THAT OPEN UP THE FILE FOR YOUR BILL AND PRESENTING BUT I'M READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. RUBBER THING NOW AND FOREVER. YOU KNOW CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. YOU CAN- IN OTHER WORKING ON BLOCKCHAIN SO I GOT HERE. AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY TALK ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN I WANTED TO STAND ON THIS FLOOR OF THE SENATE THE OTHER WORD COMMITTEE NOW AND TALK ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED WORK AT MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS THE FENCE AROUND THE SWIMMING POOL AND DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE SOPHISTICATION AND WHAT IT WAS NOT WORKING SO I INTRODUCED A BILL SOME YEARS AGO. IT WAS PASSED THIS HOUSE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT WITH. ON GETTING INVENTORY OF VARIOUS- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BEGIN THE FRAME THAT OUT. AND THEN I ALSO DID A BLOCKCHAIN BILL. BUT BASICALLY THAT TLKED ABOUT CORPORATIONS THAT COULD THEN PUT THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES IN THE BLOCKCHAIN TO PRESENT AGAINST FRAUD. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEN MAJORITY LEADER- IAN CALDERON WHO DID IT THE STATE A BASIC STUDY GROUP WORKING GROUP BOTH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON MISTER ALAN AND I WERE INVOLVED IN AND WE PUT TOGETHER THE GREATEST EXPERTS AROUND THE STATE AND THEN BERKELEY A NUMBER OF TIMES. AND THEY MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH RESPECT TO MOVING THE DISCUSSION IN GOVERNMENT THE FORWARD ON BLOCKCHAIN. AND WE'RE NOT THE FIRST SURPRISING TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WYOMING. THE GREAT STATE OF WYOMING THIS LARK THAT'S SMALLER THAN CENTER ARE JEWELERS DISTRICT CURRENTLY PERMITS THE USE OF BLOCKCHAIN STATE GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZES SECRETARY OF STATE. IMPLEMENT BLOCKCHAIN BASED COMMERCIAL FILINGS. COLORADO WHICH IS PROBABLY THE SIZE OF A COUPLE OF SENATE DISTRICTS HERE. PASS LEGISLATION TO EXPLORE THE USE OF BLOCKCHAIN TO SECURELY TRANSFER RECORDS. BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES AND PER CONFIDENTIAL DATA. THE PRIVATE SECTOR DEPARTMENT STORES USING BLOCKCHAINS NOW TO CREATE SHARED LEDGERS AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN MERCHANT SHIPPERS. AND PURCHASERS TO ELIMINATE INVOICE DISPUTES AND SOME GROCERY PROVIDERS COFFEE. AND OTHERS USING BLOCKCHAINS DEPLOY FOOD TRACEABILITY SYSTEMS TO INCREASE PRODUCT TRACING AND THE COST. OF FOOD BORNE ILLNESSES AND CONTAMINATION SO. IT'S THE STARTED ON PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY AS I SAY WE SUGGESTED BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP. THAT MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON AND I WERE PART OF. AND SO WHAT ARE WE DOING FORWARD. ARMED THIS IS AIMED AT ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS COMING FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN. A WORKING GROUP IN A DEALS WITH VERIFIED CREDENTIALS. VERIFIED VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS ARE PART OF OUR DAILY LIFE THINK FOR EXAMPLE OF. A DRIVER'S LICENSE WE USED TO- A WE CAN DRIVE A CAR PASSED TO BLESSED TRAVEL COUNTRIES HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS THAT ARE USED TO IMPROVE OUR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. VERIFYING THESE CREDENTIALS ARE MEMBERS IS OFTEN A TIME CONSUMING PAPER BASED PROCESS WITHOUT ADEQUATE SECURITY ELECTRONIC CREDENTIALS ARE SEEN AS TOO EASILY FORGED AND UNRELIABLE BLOCKCHAIN BASED CREDENTIALS. CAN HELP REMOVE FRICTION THAT ENABLES SECURING SHOWING UP ONLINE CREDENTIALS VERIFIED FOR PROOF UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS CONTROL SO THIS MEASURE DOES TWO THINGS ONE IT CREATES THE CALIFORNIA TRUST REMARK. TO ENSURE THE USE OF VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS ON TO A STANDARD RECOGNIZED BY BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR TAKES US DOWN THE ROAD THE NEXT STEP. IT IS TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENGAGES IN THIS AND THEN IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR A- ARE ON THE ABILITY IN PARTICULAR LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHERE THEY CAN USE THE BLOCKCHAIN TO VERIFY THE HIGH SCHOOL. RECORDS AS THEY WANT TO MOVE ON TO USE THEM FOR OTHER PURPOSES COLLEGE OR THE LIKE AGAIN TRYING TO EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION IN THAT REGARD SO TODAY. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MAY. IS CLEAN OR- WITHDRAW- IP FOUNDATION AND TONI ROSE WITH IT WITH INPUT OUTPUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS FOR SUPPORTERS MEASURE THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG MISLI. NOR- YOU CAN BEGIN. AT A MEETING AND CHAIRMAN DODDLE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK INTO OF SB ELEVEN NINETY. I AM JUDITH CLEANER DIRECTOR OF. ENGAGEMENT FOR THE TRUCK OVER I. T. FOR. CALLING MARIE CALIFORNIA. RUSTENBURG PGM BASED ORGANIZATION WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED CORPORATE AND INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. WE ARE COMMUNITY CREATING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTEROPERABLE TRUST FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS THE ONE THATWILL BE CREATED WHEN THIS BILL IF PASSED PROBLEM. WHEN THE INTERNET WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED IT WAS DIVINE INTERCONNECT MACHINES TO SHARE INFORMATION ACROSS THE NETWORK. THE INTERNET PROTOCOL TELLS YOU NOTHING ABOUT THE PERSON THE ORGANIZATION OR THE THING RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT CONNECTION. THE INTERNET WITH A WILDLY SUCCESSFUL BUT WE BUILT ALL THE SYSTEMS YOU BUSINESS INTERACTIONS OVER IT BUT WE- AUTHENTICATING THE USER. THE DREADED NAME A PASS LOG IN WITH BORN. IN ADDITION TO THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES WITH PASSWORD BIG DON'T REPLICATE HOW CREDENTIALS WORK IN THE REAL WORLD. IN THE REAL WORLD THE CREDENTIALS ISSUED. SOME ELEMENT THAT DESIGNATE AS BEING FROM A BALLOT ISSUE ONE. A. DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A RECOGNIZABLE FORMAT WITH SECURITY FEATURES BUT IN ABLE ITS AUTHENTICITY TO BE VALIDATED AND USE IT WHEREVER THEY WANT. IT IS SIX BY MULTIPLE PARTIES AS A BALLOT BY DESIGN WITHOUT A PARTY LEADING TO GO BACK TO THE ISSUER. WITH THE ADVENT OF MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY WE NOW HAVE A WAY TO DO THE SAME THING WITH DIGITAL CREDENTIAL. OUR PARTY THAT NEEDS TO VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE CREDENTIALS TO DO THAT WITH DON'T NEED TO PHONE HOME TO A CENTRAL SYSTEM. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS. BOARD IF YOU COULD TAKE A VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS OF THEIR TRANSCRIPT. ISSUED TO THEM BY THE HIGH SCHOOL TO DO ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY WANT AND THE COLLEGE CAN VERIFY THAT IT IS AUTHENTIC. THIS IS EXACTLY THE USE CASE THIS BILL WILL AUTHORIZE VIA APPHIGHLY PROJECT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD A PATH FOR OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW.

POSING PENSION DIVESTMENT AND- OTHER MEANS OF- WITHDRAWING CALIFORNIA'S FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND I KNOW THAT SOME FOLKS AREN'T ARE NATURALLY HESITANT THAT WE ARE INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL FEARS INTO THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD CAUTION. THAT THAT THAT KIND OF DEFAULT THINKING IS APPROPRIATE HERE. THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- THAT WE HAVE SEEN ON THE GLOBAL STAGE THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION. THEY REQUIRE US TO ACT JUST AS AMERICA'S ACTING AND EUROPE IS ACTING AND PARTS OF ASIA OR ACTING. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL OUT WHAT IS BEING DONE IN UKRAINE. IT IS SPECIFICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS BEING DONE BY THE RUSSIAN BY RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP. NO I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID WELL OUR FIGHT IS NOT WITH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. IT IS TAKING GREAT. CLAIM AGAINST RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP IN PARTICULAR THE PRESS. THE IS ACE. ON THE GROUND IN IN ON THE SCALE OF THINGS THIS IS A SMALL BUT TERRIBLY SYMBOLIC GESTURE THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING IS CALIFORNIANS IF WE HAVE WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION OUR PENSION AND OTHER TYPES OF INVESTMENTS. ARE THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR IT AS PART OF A SANCTIONS PROGRAM WE MUST DO IT IT'S A MORAL IMPERATIVE SO I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS. HI THIS A LETTER- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT ONE PROVISION- ALLOWS IT IS TO BE WITHDRAWN OR REPEALED AS SOON AS THE RUSSIANS STALTER HOLD THIRD VANCE- I WOULD I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE NOT HAVE THAT PROVISION IN THERE- BECAUSE UNTIL RUSSIA NOT ONLY HOLDS ITS ADVANCE BUT WITHDRAWS FROM ALL OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND MAKES AN FINANCIAL A MAN'S- OF FOR ALL OF THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE. SO THAT IS A PERFECT WORLD I WON'T INSIST ON THAT ONE POINT BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND I WANT TO- CALL UPON OUR COLLEAGUES. LET CALIFORNIA'S BE HEARD.
