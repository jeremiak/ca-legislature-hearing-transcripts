00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.394
ENSURE THAT THE MONEY WE'RE

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:38.663
GIVING -- VOLUNTARILY ARE

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.565
SERVING ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.601
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.570
BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:48.106
INHIBITING THE GRANTING LEGAL

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:50.742
SERVICES MONEY TO UNDOCUMENTED.

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:53.344
IMMIGRANTS -- AND THOSE GRANTS

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.613
GOING -- TO BUT THE SERVICES

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.881
THAT WE HAVE NOTHING IN PLACE TO

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.249
ENSURE THAT THOSE GRANTS ARE

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.284
ACTUALLY BE GIVING TO

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.686
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A HAVE

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:02.520
CREATED.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:04.222
A WAY TO SERVE UNDOCUMENTED

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.723
IMMIGRANTS SO WE ARE STILL ARE

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.692
WE STILL GIVING MONEY TO FOLKS

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:11.129
WHO REFUSED TO SERVE.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:12.330
SO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:14.632
THAT QUESTION OTHER THAN.

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.167
MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE STATE

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:18.436
BAR'S FINDING IS DRIVEN BY THE

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.605
ABLE TO FUNDING -- SO IT'S VERY

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:22.774
FORMULAIC IN IN THE SENSE OF THE

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.908
GRANTS THAT ARE GIVEN.

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.209
UP BUT WE SOON THEY'RE OPEN TO

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:26.711
WORKING WITH YOU AND THIS

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.746
COMMITTEE -- IN EXPLORING

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.815
ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.117
THAT THAT FUNDING CAN GO TO

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:33.751
THOSE CALIFORNIA'S THAT NEED IT

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:33.951
MOST.

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.987
YEAH I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:39.090
WE ARE NOT ALLOWING THEM AND AN

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:39.824
EASY.

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.693
AN EXCUSE OF SOME OF THESE

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:43.428
PROVIDERS TO NOT SERVE ALL

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:45.496
CALIFORNIANS -- JUST BECAUSE THE

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:48.399
FEDERAL LAW IS WHAT IT IS THERE

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.535
ARE PLENTY OF WAYS -- TO AS WE

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.936
HAVE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:52.870
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:55.273
FIGURED OUT WAYS. TO CONTINUE TO

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.908
RECEIVE FUNDING AND SERVE

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:59.277
UNDOCUMENTED -- CALIFORNIANS

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.212
ABSOLUTELY -- MY NEXT QUESTION

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.214
YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER TO

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.315
BUT IT'S ONE I'VE ASKED.

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:05.917
AND IT MAY TAKE.

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.118
A LOT TO GET IT BUT DO WE HAVE

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:09.287
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENDER

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:12.557
MAKEUP OF INACTIVE.

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:16.627
ATTORNEYS.

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:19.364
AB WE BELIEVE WE DO -- BASED ON

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.998
THE RECENT SURVEYS THAT WE SENT

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.867
OUT TO OUR LICENSEES WE DON'T

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.335
HAVE THE INFORMATION READILY

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:25.203
AVAILABLE.

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.771
NOW BUT WE ARE AWARE OF THE

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.840
REQUEST AND WILL START GOING

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.608
THROUGH SOME OF THAT INFORMATION

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.043
TO PROVIDE YOUR STAFF AND YOU

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.378
WITH THE DATA.

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:34.278
MY CONCERN IS THAT SIGN AND

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.447
WHERE I'VE I'VE ASKED OBVIOUSLY --

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:40.084
WHAT OTHER PROFESSIONS WHEN YOU --

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:41.686
DON'T PRACTICE REQUIRE YOU AFTER

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:45.757
COURSE LAW SCHOOL AND THAT AND

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.058
PASSING THE BAR TO ACTUALLY --

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.828
PAY A FEE TO IN ORDER TO ONE DAY.

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:53.898
COME BACK IN PRACTICE -- I DON'T

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:54.932
KNOW THE NUMBERS WE'VE ASKED ONE

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.501
BECAUSE I WOULD GUESS THAT WOMEN

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.803
OVERWHELMINGLY GO IN ACTIVE MORE

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.105
THAN MEN -- BECAUSE OF CHILDREN

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:05.009
AND OTHER REASONS -- AND

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:05.877
INCREASING THAT FEE.

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:06.944
IT IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.746
CONCERNED ABOUT I I THINK THE

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.416
FACT THAT WE CHARGE PEOPLE IS --

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:13.317
LUDICROUS BUT THE FACT T

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:14.685
ACTUALLY INCREASING AND THIS

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.621
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND I AM

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.055
CONCERNED WITH -- THE

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:19.056
DISPARITIES THAT WE'RE

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:23.795
CONTINUING TO PLACE ON FOLKS WHO.

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.062
HAVE.

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:26.230
TO FOR OFTEN FAMILY REASONS THE

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:28.533
WOMAN IS ONE WHO.

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:29.133
MAY LEAVE THE PROFESSION FOR A

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.536
WHILE.

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:32.637
SO YOU WILL GET UP FOR ME.

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:33.771
THIS GOES TO APPROPRIATE WILL WE

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:34.872
GET AN ANSWER BEFORE

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.474
PREPARATIONS.

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.242
WE SO WE GOT A REQUEST LAST

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:38.976
NIGHT.

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.378
WE ARE MOVING TO ONE IDENTIFIED

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:41.712
WHETHER WE HAVE THE INFORMATION

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:44.615
I THINK WE WE BELIEVE WE DO --

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:45.683
AND WILL.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.351
MARSHALL THAT RESOURCES TO GET

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:48.186
YOU THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:50.455
POSSIBLE OKAY AND I KNOW -- WHEN

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:51.923
WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT OBVIOUSLY

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.058
BUT I I'M REALLY CONCERNED OF OF

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:57.395
WHY WE CAN'T SCALE -- FOR LEGAL

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:59.130
SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO DON'T

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:01.799
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OR FOR FOLKS

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:04.769
WHO WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:06.804
THE STATE DOESN'T ALWAYS PAY

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:08.105
YOUR BAR DUES.

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:09.273
IN SOME.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.609
JOBS THEY DO FOR EXAMPLE AN

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.277
ATTORNEY IN THE SENATE -- GETS

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.078
THEIR PARTICIPATE FOR AN

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:15.913
ATTORNEY IN ASSEMBLY DOES NOT

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.615
ACCEPT I THINK.

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.951
YOUR STAFF -- SO.

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:21.752
AN ATTORNEY AND APPROPRIATIONS

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.654
IN THE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT GET THE

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:24.755
BAR DUES PAID.

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.457
IN TALK ABOUT STAFF NOT MEMBERS --

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.092
IN SO THERE'S THIS DISPARITY

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.261
THAT I THINK AT GIVE AND WE KNOW

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:33.130
THAT THIS HAS VERY LITTLE AFFECT

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:35.700
ON HIGH INCOME EARNERS WHERE

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.568
THEIR LAW FIRM PAYS THEIR FEES.

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.136
AND HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE FACT

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.238
ON PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY USING

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:41.839
THEIR LOT AGREES TO SERVE THE

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:44.075
PUBLIC -- I KNOWWE HAD ASKED

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.010
FOR SCALENE AND FOR A NUMBER OF

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:46.644
REASONS I WAS TOLD THAT WAS A

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:52.049
TAX SIR ANY OTHER WAY WE CAN --

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.551
RELIEVE THE BURDEN THAT THIS

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.052
PLACES ON WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.387
WHAT WE WANT A LOT OF ATTORNEYS

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:59.423
TO DO IS USE THEIR LAW DEGREE.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.260
TO SERVE POOR PEOPLE.

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.562
PUBLIC DEFENDERS YEAH I'D LIKE

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.531
TO IT JUST JUMP IN HERE I I

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:07.899
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.500
BE LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD I

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.636
KEEP READING ABOUT HOW LAW FIRMS

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.204
ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS.

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.839
ARE AND HOW.

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.874
WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:20.111
TO STEP UP AND TO TO PERFORM

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:21.946
LEGAL SERVICES TO TO USE THEIR

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.081
LAW DEGREES FOR THE PUBLIC

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.483
INTEREST AS WELL.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:29.287
AND THAT THIS -- THIS BILL IS IS --

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.922
SILENT TO AS TO THAT IN PART OF

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:32.757
IT IS AS YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.992
CONCERN ABOUT A TAX -- BUT I BUT

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.160
I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:37.929
WE SHOULD LOOK AT GOING FORWARD

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:40.598
BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S LIKE THAT THE

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.499
INCOME INEQUALITY WERE SEEN

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:43.234
THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:45.369
THE THE LAW THE SUCCESSFUL

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.204
WELFARE LAW FIRMS ARE GETTING

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:48.539
WEALTHIER.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.608
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE SCRAMBLING

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.543
TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.812
OBLIGATIONS AS A PRACTICING

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.414
ATTORNEYS I MIGHT SAY THAT THAT

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.282
MIGHT BE AN INCENTIVE TO THINK

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.884
ABOUT RUNNING FOR THE SENATE.

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.852
THAT WE DO GET OUR BAR DUES PAID

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.188
THEIR BUT I JUST THROW THAT OUT

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:05.890
IS TO A PARENTHETICAL

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.659
OBSERVATION AND NOT NECESSARILY

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:10.194
WANT TO PAINT MAYBE DON'T TELL

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:14.498
MY SENATOR THAT.

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.300
WELL.

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.668
THAT'S ALSO A POINT WELL TAKEN

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.636
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE TO

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.471
CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT ADD TO

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:20.771
THE SOME.

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:21.706
BETTER WAY TO RECOGNIZE THE

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:22.974
DISPARITIES BUT AT THIS POINT IN

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.342
TIME THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.409
DOES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.011
CONVERSATION I WOULD BE VERY

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.446
INTERESTED IN IN HAVING WOULD

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.314
YOU BE WILLING AND AND JUST TO

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.449
THINK ABOUT AND I ASK YOU TO

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.084
TAKE IT NOW BUT I I WOULD.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.886
BE -- I I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:36.821
DO IT IN THIS BILL BUT I WOULD

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.656
LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:41.559
LEAST TO BE ON THE HOOK -- FOR

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:46.097
PAIN ARGUES FOR ATTORNEYS -- WHO

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.332
WORK FOR THE STATE?

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:49.266
AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN PLACE

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.469
IN A SPELL BUT THAT'S OUTSIDE

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.803
THE SCOPE OF THAT'S WHAT I THINK

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.437
ARE THE MARVELOUS THAT WOULD BE

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:55.940
A BUDGET.

00:37:56.007 --> 00:38:00.177
I WANT IT NOW.

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.379
TOUGH TALK BUT I I MEAN I IN ALL

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.847
HONESTY I'M I'M PAYING MY BARGES

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.248
AND I HAVE DESPITE.

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:06.217
MAKING VERY LITTLE MONEY AS AN

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:09.420
ATTORNEY MY ENTIRE LIFE RIGHT.

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:10.087
I'M.

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:13.124
I THINK WHAT.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.460
IT THAT'S FINE I I'VE CHOSEN TO

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.462
TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND DO THAT BUT

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:21.432
OUR STAFF AND PEOPLE WHO -- YOU

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:23.300
KNOW HAVE HAVE GIVEN LEAVE THEIR

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:24.101
LEGAL.

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.536
SERVICE TO THE STATE OF

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:26.837
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S WHOLLY

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.673
UNFAIR ON THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:32.009
RAISE ARGUES ON ON FOLKS WHO ARE.

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.111
DOING A PUBLIC SERVICE WITH

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:35.746
THEIR LAW DEGREE -- I'M

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:36.881
EXTREMELY CONCERNED ON THIS BILL

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.115
I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY BUT I

00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:40.484
AM STILL CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:44.922
IF YOU'RE MAKING -- UNDER SIX

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.991
FIGURES AS DOING LEGAL AID

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.592
SERVICES THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.895
WE'RE RAISING THE COST OF DOING

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.731
YOUR JOB -- AND MEANWHILE.

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:56.467
THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT THE MOST

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.602
DON'T PAY THEIR OWN PARTY WAS SO --

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:02.373
THERE'S JUST A OF A VERY.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.474
BIG DISPARITY I THINK AND AND

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.776
THE EFFECT THAT THIS HAS ON WHAT

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:06.744
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LAWYER

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.045
STILL ANNOUNCED GOING TO PUBLIC

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:10.414
SERVICE -- AGAIN THE THE

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:13.217
QUESTION ON ON WHY WERE RAISING --

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:14.819
FEES FOR PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO BE

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.088
AN ACTIVE I IT IT JUST IS BEYOND

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:21.659
ME THEY'RE LITERALLY ACOSTA OF

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.961
OF HAVING AND REMAINING AN

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:24.795
ATTORNEY.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:28.132
WHAT OTHER PROFESSION HAS TO PAY

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.300
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR JUST?

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.168
TO REMAINING YOUR PROFESSION

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:33.204
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PRACTICING.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.838
IF YOU'RE STAYING HOME WITH YOUR

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:34.605
KIDS.

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.040
I DIDN'T I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.775
TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT THE IT

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.710
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:40.511
AS WE LOOKED AT THIS BAR DUES

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:42.847
BILL WE HAVE TRIED TO REVAMP THE

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.482
BAR WE TRY TO MAKE IT MORE

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:47.318
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE

00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:50.020
PUBLIC -- WE'VE.

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:52.556
NARROWED ITS FOCUS WE HAVE CUT

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.958
THEM OFF AT THE KNEES IN SOME

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:55.693
RESPECTS APPROPRIATELY SO I

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.995
THINK AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.930
MAKE SURE WE CAN IMPLEMENT OUR

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.966
EXPECTATIONS OF THEM.

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:03.534
AND THIS IS THE MECHANISM FOR

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.269
DUES HAVE HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:06.470
THE MECHANISM.

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.606
AS FAR AS TOURING THIS I THINK

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.474
THE POINT'S WELL TAKEN BUT

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:11.776
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP THE BAR.

00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:14.712
BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE EXPECT AND

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:17.148
DEMAND THAT IT TOO AND SO RIGHT

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.949
WELL I APPRECIATE THOSE CONCERNS

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.217
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANY OF

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.786
THEM -- I AT THIS POINT TIME

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:23.254
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.088
TO GIVE THE BARK.

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:26.290
OF THE MONEY IT NEEDS TO DO THE

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:28.092
THINGS THAT WERE TELLING IT IT

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.427
NEEDS TO DO AND I I WILL SAY I

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.695
THANK YOU TO THE BAR FOR BEING

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.898
RESPONSIVE I KNOW TO A LOT OF

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:36.400
OUR QUESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:36.734
LAST.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.469
LONG AS WE'VE BEEN HERE -- AND

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:42.473
AND WE HAVE BEEN REALLY TOUGH ON

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:42.706
THE BAR.

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.475
AM AND THE BAR HAS.

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.010
STEPPED UP AND I DO I IN I MET

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.111
WITH US YEAH YOU FOLKS I THINK

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.512
THEY DESERVE.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:48.779
YOU KNOW.

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:52.016
THIS MONEY -- MY MY PROBLEM IS --

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.084
THE REGRESSIVE NATURE BY WHICH

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:56.187
WE ARE A SIGN IT TO ATTORNEYS

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:57.121
AND SO I WOULD.

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:58.789
BE MORE WILLING TO INCREASE

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:02.660
ARGUES MORE FOR THOSE WHO AT ARE

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.328
MAKING MORE.

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:08.232
AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.234
PROVIDING A DESCENDANT OF TO

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.902
ACTUALLY DO PUBLIC SERVICE SO

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.170
THAT'S MY CONCERNS AS WE MOVE

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:14.138
FORWARD BUT I DO WANT TO THANK

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:16.540
DONE ON THIS AND I KNOW WE SHARE

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:19.143
THE SAME CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.278
TO THESE ISSUES -- I WOULD LIKE

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.747
TO SEE SOMETHING DONE -- THIS

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:26.116
YEAR I NOW I CAN'T GET A BUDGET

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.319
ITEM DONE -- THAT.

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.955
SOMETHING DONE IN IN TERMS OF

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.922
AND EVEN THE SAME CALIFORNIA

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:34.158
DOESN'T RESOLVE THE LEGAL AID

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:36.227
ISSUE -- PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.494
IMMIGRATION.

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:38.896
SPECIALISTS ARE ATTORNEYS WHO

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.898
WHO ARE WORKING FOR NONPROFITS

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.766
ME WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF FOLKS

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.768
ARE NOT MAKING SIX FIGURES AND

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.571
THIS IS A REAL BURDEN.

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:49.773
EVERY TIME WE INCREASE.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.741
THE PARTY WAS SO THAT'S MY

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:52.209
CONCERN MILLION FORWARD TO THE

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.544
NEXT COMMITTEE [inaudible]

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.579
THANK YOU.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.082
THE QUESTIONS PRESS.

00:41:58.148 --> 00:42:00.184
I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE THE

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:02.486
THE COMMENTS FROM FROM MY

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:07.658
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO -- THE

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:10.394
THE DISPROPORTIONATE -- AMOUNT

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.030
OF A BAR DUES THAT ARE BEING

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.665
REQUESTED THE INACTIVE I THINK.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.200
IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS IT'S

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.801
NOT GOING TO BE IN THIS BILL BUT

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.670
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.205
CONTINUE TO GIVE VOICE.

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:23.374
TO BECAUSE IT IS AN INEQUITY IF

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.576
WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT THE THE

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.044
NUMBERS OF STATISTICS WILL BEAR

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.879
OUT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:29.146
INACTIVE.

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:30.314
ARE WOMEN.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:33.918
WHO DO PLAN TO RETURN TO TO

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.219
ACTIVE PRACTICE?

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.887
BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT WE DO

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.722
NEED TO ADDRESS I I KNOW IT'S

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.758
BEEN BROUGHT UP -- DURING OTHER

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:43.127
HEARINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT --

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:46.130
BAR DUES AND INCREASING BAR DUES --

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:48.232
THE THE OTHER ISSUE HAS TO DO

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:51.068
WITH IT -- THE MONEY THAT GOES

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.070
TO THROUGH I'LL TO TO OUR LEGAL

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:56.607
AIDS.

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:58.642
IN MAKING SURE THAT.

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.177
THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:02.413
SERVE THE UNDOCUMENTED MANY

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:03.380
COMMITTEES TO SERVE.

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.316
OUR PRIMARILY SPANISH SPEAKING

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:08.285
AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.621
THE RECRUITMENT OF ATTORNEYS FOR

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.122
MANY OF THOSE LEGAL AIDS.

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.991
IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE NOW

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:14.491
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SPANISH

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:15.626
SPEAKERS.

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.861
AND YET IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:22.933
THAT'S GIVEN -- TO THE TWO EIGHT

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.868
COMMUNITY THAT SERVES ONLY

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.704
ENGLISH SPEAKERS VERSUS THOSE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.972
WHO SERVE SPANISH SPEAKERS.

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:30.708
AND I THINK MORE NEEDS TO BE.

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.376
DONE TO EVALUATE HOW THAT IS

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.877
DONE I I'VE BEEN A VOLUNTEER

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.879
WITH OUR LEGAL AID FOR THIRTY

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.348
YEARS FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS I'VE

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.583
SERVED ON THE BOARD. FOR ALMOST

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.418
AS LONG AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:44.054
IT IS TO TO GET MONEY FOR LEGAL

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.823
SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IN

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.257
THE COMMUNITY.

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:49.059
AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.527
NUMBERS TOGETHER TO HOW MANY

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:53.964
PEOPLE YOU'RE SERVING -- OUR

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.532
NUMBERS.

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.034
NOT JUST OUR NUMBERS BUT THE

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:57.568
NUMBERS FOR MANY OF THOSE

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.569
COMMUNITIES.

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.104
OFTENTIMES ARE LOWER BECAUSE IT

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.438
WILL TAKE LONGER TO SERVE

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.173
SOMEONE WHO'S SPANISH SPEAKING

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.541
AND HAVING TO TRANSLATE ALL THE

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:05.409
DOCUMENTS.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.478
SO I DO ASK THAT WE CONSIDER

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:08.112
THAT.

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:11.048
MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE SERVE.

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:13.751
EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:16.720
WHO NEEDS THE SERVICES OF AN

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.889
ATTORNEY AND CANNOT AFFORD IT I

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.158
THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT --

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:23.193
I I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS --

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.429
SENATOR -- BECAUSE SOMETHING

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:26.730
THAT THAT THE STATE BAR NEEDS WE

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:29.433
NEED TO TO DEAL WITH THIS BUT

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.267
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I THINK

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:30.701
THAT.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:34.138
DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.739
SOME DAY SOON.

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:38.609
I I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE I

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.144
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.312
CALIFORNIA BAR -- LAWYERS

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:44.815
ASSOCIATION RATHER OR THE OTHER --

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.817
ASPECT TO THIS WHERE THERE IS A

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:49.186
REAL PUSH TO TRY TO GET

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:52.389
ADDITIONAL SERVICES SO IT'S NOT

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.390
NECESSARILY COMING THROUGH THE

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.725
BAR BUT THERE THERE ARE TWO

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.960
OTHER ENTITIES I THINK ONE IS

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.495
THE CHANGE.

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.696
CHANGE GROUP CHANCELLOR'S CHANGE

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.799
LAWYERS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.801
THEIR VERY ISSUE SO THERE IS

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.903
DISCUSSION THERE IS EFFORT GOING

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:07.471
FORWARD IN THAT.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.506
IN THAT SPACE TO TRY TO DO WITH

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.475
THE NEEDS OF OUR PARK EVERYONE

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.143
WHO NEEDS LEGAL SERVICES SO THAT

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.212
THAT IS BEING ADDRESSED PERHAPS

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:16.046
NOT.

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:18.015
AS A SATISFACTORILY BUT THAT

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.650
DISCUSSION IS CLEARLY TAKING

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:23.053
PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE ACTUAL BAR

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.922
IT'S ITS OWN SEPARATE ENTITY

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.623
WITH THAT FOCUS BECAUSE WE'VE WE

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.392
TOLD THE BAR WE WANT TO NARAL

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:31.095
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.696
AND WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.698
SO THAT'S AYE BUT THERE IS THAT

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:35.799
CHANGE.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.868
LAWYERS THAT IS -- THE ENTITY

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:40.404

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.252
A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE

STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAU CHIU

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.490
GONZALEZ [inaudible]

HOLDEN KALRA [inaudible]

00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:02.926
KILEY.

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:06.163
IN CHINA OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.463
[inaudible]

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.434
REYES.

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.102
WE DO HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.138
WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.205
THANK YOU.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.840
SO WE'VE.

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:17.975
BUT ON A LONG JOURNEY WILL

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:19.877
CONTINUE TO BE A LONG JOURNEY.

00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:21.745
I THINK WITH THE BAR AND A

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.046
NUMBER OF ASPECTS.

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.382
ARE CHANGING AT ALTHOUGH IT IS

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:27.551
FRUSTRATING.

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:28.819
DO RECOGNIZE A LOT OF CHANGES

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.320
THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE BAR

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:31.488
OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:34.324
YET THE AUDIT REPORT AND THE LA --

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.426
BOTH POINT OUT TO A SIGNIFICANT

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.028
LACK OF PHYSICAL CONTROLS AT THE

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:40.063
BAR.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.365
SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT.

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.033
THERE'S SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.235
WHAT THE BAR ASKED FOR AND WHAT

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:46.904
BOTH ALEJO AND THE AUDITOR'S

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.072
SAID WERE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.340
INCREASE THE FEES.

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:52.009
A LOT HAD TO DO WITH LACK OF

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:53.977
INTERNAL CONTROLS IS ASTONISHING

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.479
DIEM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:57.381
THE BAR RECENTLY ASKED FOR AND

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:59.183
WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY ENDING UP

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:01.251
WITH HERE WHICH I THINK

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.653
UNDERSCORES AT THE BAR.

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.988
NEED SOME WORK WITH RESPECT TO

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.890
MANAGING ITS OWN FINANCES AND

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:08.358
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.560
THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT AND IF

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:10.794
YOU LOOK AT THE ANNOUNCES.

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:13.163
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO THE

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.764
REAL ESTATE DECISIONS HAD BEEN

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.464
MADE.

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.966
AND AS THOSE BARS TELLING US

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:16.967
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIXING

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:19.303
SOME OF THE THE LEASING REVENUES

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:21.238
AND SOME OF THE THEY ASPECTS OF

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:22.239
OF MANAGING THEIR PROPERTY AND

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.007
AS THEY DO.

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.842
THAT SHOULD RESULT IN.

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.411
A REDUCTION IN FEES OR IN THE

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.613
LEAST A MITIGATION OF HAVING TO

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.515
INCREASE FEES AND IN THE FUTURE.

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:32.849
SO THEIR NUMBER CATEGORIES THAT

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.318
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING AND THAT I

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:36.186
THINK WE NEED. TO TO TO HOLD

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.287
ONTO.

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:39.690
AS A COMMITTEE AND YES.

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:42.292
THERE IS THIS A THOUGHT OF DOING

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.994
THE BAR DUES BILL EVERY COUPLE

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.496
OF YEARS I AM.

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:47.197
PERSONALLY AND I'M NOW I'VE

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:48.365
TALKED TO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:51.101
NOT READY FOR THAT BECAUSE OF

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.703
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE WE HAVE

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.972
HAD AND I THINK THE BAR STILL

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.807
NEEDS TO BUILD BACK SOME TRUST.

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.375
AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:00.811
LEGISLATURE ON BEING ABLE TO

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:01.945
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR FINANCIAL

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.513
SITUATION IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.715
WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE I THINK IT

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.515
IS INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE SURE

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.283
THAT WE ARE FUNDING YOU

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.885
APPROPRIATELY FOR THE MISSION WE

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:11.054
HAVE SET YOU ON AND MAKING SURE

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.489
THAT WE'RE THE BARS.

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.358
HELPING FACILITATE A LOT OF

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:15.759
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FACT WEEK

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:17.794
ASK THIS OF THE LEGISLATURE.

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.630
HAS PUT LEGAL SERVICES MONEY ON

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:20.797
THE TABLE THROUGH THE JUDICIARY

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.165
BUDGET EVERY YEAR BECAUSE WE

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.700
KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.636
GAPS AND LACK OF LEGAL SERVICES

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.637
FUNDING COMING FROM.

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:28.105
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH A

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:29.006
LOT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.707
RELIED ON IN THE PAST SO WE DO

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.743
NEED TO BE LOOKING EVERYWHERE WE

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:35.879
CAN FOR LEGAL SERVICES MONEY AND

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:38.448
TO BE ABLE. TO TO GET PEOPLE

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:39.983
THAT LEGAL HELP THAT THEY NEED

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.451
ULTIMATELY.

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:43.287
WITH RESPECT TO THE SCALE AND WE

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:45.289
COULD DO THE SCALING BUT WE

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:46.657
COULD DO WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE.

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:47.858
AND I THINK THIS HOUSE THIS

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.593
COMMITTEES PROBABLY READY FOR

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.093
THAT.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.928
LEADERSHIP HAS INDICATED THAT

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.263
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THAT THE

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.298
TIME THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.667
MOVING FORWARD ON A TWO THIRDS

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:57.200
VOTE BUT WE COULD DO THAT

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:58.302
BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY.

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.102
THOSE HIGHER PAID ATTORNEYS

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.338
WOULD BE IN A WAY SUBSIDIZE THE

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:02.372
LOWER PAID ATTORNEYS.

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.373
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE A TWO

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.641
THIRDS VOTE UNLESS WE CAN BE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:05.909
CLEVER ABOUT STRUCTURING IT SOME

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:07.511
OTHER WAY WE HAVE.

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:08.945
YET TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND MAKE

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:10.514
AND THAT'S THAT'S BUILT INTO

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.249
THIS IS THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:13.517
LOOKING WORKING WITH THE BAR. TO

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.951
SEE HOW WE CAN EFFECTIVELY SCALE

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:17.354
IT IT IS FRUSTRATING TO PUT A

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:19.356
PROGRESSIVE FEE IN PLACE

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:21.024
REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE.

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:22.392
AND WE'RE STUCK WITH WHAT IS IN

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.161
FACT A VERY REGRESSIVE FEE AND A

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:25.662
REGRESSIVE STRUCTURE THAT HURTS

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:28.799
ATTORNEYS AT THE LOWEST AND

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.634
WHERE WE DO NEED MORE HELP.

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:31.201
THIS COMMITTEES ALSO BEEN

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:33.303
WORKING ON ENSURING THAT WE GET

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.238
MORE TOURNEY'S INTO THE PRACTICE

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:35.739
WHICH WOULD.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.075
HELP WITH RAISING MORE FEES ARE

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:38.775
MITIGATING.

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.310
THE FEES BY ENSURING THAT WE

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:42.879
HAVE DIVERSITY ACROSS THE THE

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:45.282
BREADTH OF THE BAR AND THE BENCH

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:49.920
AS WELL AS I THINK WE SHOULD.

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.021
WE'RE LONG PAST TO HAVE THE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:51.621
CONVERSATION ABOUT OPENING UP

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:52.289
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES SO

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:53.590
WE GET HIGH QUALITY ATTORNEYS IN

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.125
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.326
THAT THAT LEAVES IT TO THE BAR

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:57.728
TO DO THE ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE

00:49:57.794 --> 00:49:58.295
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.196
DOING.

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.131
THE OTHER ASPECT THAT CAME OUT

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.232
OF THE LA REPORT.

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:05.402
DAILY -- REPORT IS.

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.269
TO I WHAT THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:07.404
A SETTING UP THE PROCESS TO

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:10.140
BRING THE BAR INTO OUR NORMAL

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:11.608
BUDGETING PROCESS.

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:15.412
WE HAVE A VIEW OF WHAT THE FEES

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.114
ARE AND WE GET SOME SENSE OF

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.449
WHAT THE HOW THAT THE BAR DOES

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.151
SOME BUDGETING BUT IF THEY WERE

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.586
PART OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS.

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.087
THEN THE BUDGET EXPERTS WOULD

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:25.322
HAVE INSIGHT INTO THE DECISIONS

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.524
THAT GET MADE BY THE BAR ON AN

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.159
ANNUAL BASIS WE WOULD HAVE A

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:31.061
MUCH BETTER SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.596
SPENDING THE MONEY THAT WE'RE

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.131
ALLOWING THEM TO COLLECT AND AS

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.365
A PUBLIC AGENCY I THINK THAT'S

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.433
VERY APPROPRIATE.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.534
THAT'S GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.403
BUDGET STAFF AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:41.071
THAT THEY'RE ABLE AND WILLING TO

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:42.272
DO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.640
SETTING UP IN THIS BILL I THINK

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.375
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.710
COMPONENT OF IT.

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:47.344
IF WE HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS IN

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:50.614
PLACE THEN IF WE DO A MULTI YEAR

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.883
FEE STRUCTURE IF WE DO A LOT OF

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.584
THE THE THINGS THAT THE BARS

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.620
ASKING FOR THAT THE OTTER THE LA --

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.622
WE'RE STARTING TO RECOMMEND.

00:50:58.688 --> 00:50:59.256
I THINK WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.524
PLACE THAN TO HAVE THE CONTROLS

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.859
IN PLACE THE OVERSIGHT THAT IS

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.594
OUR OBLIGATION OF PLACE AND OUR

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:08.064
ABILITY TO MANAGE WHAT HOW THAT.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:08.899
PUBLIC AGENCIES BOTH DOING ITS

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:11.134
JOB WITH RESPECT. TO PUBLIC

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:12.536
PROTECTION BUT ALSO MANAGING ITS

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.538
FINANCES SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:15.572
HERE IN CENTER.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:16.473
YOU TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS AND

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.175
WORKING WITH US AS WE MOVE

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.810
TOWARDS THIS GOAL SAID IT'S BEEN

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:20.977
QUITE A JOURNEY OVER THE LAST

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:21.812
FEW YEARS.

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.914
GETTING US TO THIS PLACE THEN

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.315
AND STRUCTURING.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.049
THE STATE BAR.

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:29.019
AS A A MODERN.

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.420

A NIGHTMARE AND IT AFFECTED OUR

THE PRIDE BEAMING FROM HIS FACE

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.173

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.523
BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:04.126

IN GUARANTEED BY THE

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:13.482
CONSTITUTION AND HAVE BEEN HARD --

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:14.850
WON RECENT COURT CASES HAVE

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.586
SHOWN THE CROSS EXAMINATION IS

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.688

THAT'S GOING ON NOW.

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.404
IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAPPEN

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.206
AT THE HEARING LEVEL IF YOU TAKE

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.141
OUT SUBSECTION TWO THEN THE BILL

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.709

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:41.777
EXAMINATION.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.779
AND ALLOWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.948
OF VICTIMS BY APPEARING.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.318
IN A BY VIDEO CONFERENCE -- FOR

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:49.718
ELSE.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.719
OR SOME OTHER MEANS THAT

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:53.055
PROTECTS THEM TRAUMA INFORMED AS

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.424
A PROBLEM ONLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.659
DEFINED IN THE LAW.

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.694
TRUST NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.129
VICTIMS BEING TREATED WITH

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.430
RESPECT.

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:09.338
AND WITH -- WITH CARE AND GREAT

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:10.105
COMPASSION.

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:11.073
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN IMPARTIAL

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:11.774
INVESTIGATOR START OUT BY

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.641
BELIEVING THAT THE ACCUSED IS

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.776
GUILTY WHICH IS OFTEN WHAT

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:14.476
TRAUMA INFORMED TO MEANS.

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.544
THE INVESTIGATOR HAS TO START

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.845
OUT BY BELIEVING THE VICTIM

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:17.813
THERE.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.214
FOR THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS NOW

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:21.250
ON THE ON THE ACCUSED TO PROVE

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:22.585
THEMSELVES INNOCENT.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.787
THAT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.589
WHICH ALSO IS NOT MENTIONED IN

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.524
THIS IN THIS BILL AND IT ALSO

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.826
DOES NOT MENTION THE PRESUMPTION

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.561
OF INNOCENCE FOR THE ACCUSED.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:36.632
SO IT IMPROPERLY TRANSFERS THOSE --

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:38.233
BURDENS TO AN ACCUSED AND

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.370
ACCUSER NOT SIMPLY MALE STUDENTS

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.339
I THINK OF A DRIVE BUT I I CITED

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.474
SEVERAL EXAMPLES -- I'VE GOT

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:48.143
MANY OTHER CASES THAT INVOLVE --

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.513
EITHER SAME SEX OR A FEMALE --

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.315
PERPETRATOR AND IT'S WHOEVER

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:54.750
GETS TO THE TITLE NINE OFFICE

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.819
FIRST IS THE ONE THAT WINS

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.554
BECAUSE OF THE PRESUMPTIONS.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:00.289
AND IF THERE'S NO PROTECTIONS

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.091
FOR THE ACCUSED THEN WHAT

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:03.792
HAPPENS IS IF YOU'RE ACCUSED YOU

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.927
LOSE.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.028
AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.129
AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY COURT

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.198
CASES HAVE GONE AGAINST THE

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:12.635
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THIRTY

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.303
AND IT ROUTES STATE SYSTEM -- I

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.204
WOULD URGE THAT THE BILL BE

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.171
AMENDED FURTHER I HAVEN'T SEEN

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:17.072
THE NEW AMENDMENTS PERHAPS MY

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.574
POSITION WOULD CHANGE.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.142
BUT I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE OF

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.878
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HEARINGS.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:24.046
WITH BOTH VICTIMS AND

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.982
PERPETRATORS IN CAMPUS HEARINGS

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.150
AND ALSO DEALING WITH IT IN

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.952
COURT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:30.819
COURT OF APPEAL.

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:32.321
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.256
BE FIXED BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:34.657
TO IT [inaudible]

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:37.760

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.399
UNIVERSITY'S OFFICE OF GENERAL

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.634
COUNSEL -- WE SUPPORT STRONGLY

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:46.969
THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL IN THE

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.203
VAST MAJORITY WITH PROVISIONS

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.705
HOWEVER IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED OUR

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:52.808
POSITION IS OPPOSED LESS AMENDED --

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.376
THE CSU STRONGLY EMBRACES THE

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:56.311
IDEA AT THE HEART OF AS BEFORE

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:56.912
NINETY THREE THAT ALL STUDENTS

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.080
HAVE A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.648
FREE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.150
THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE A VITAL

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:01.784
ROLE IN KEEPING THEIR STUDENTS

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.718
SAFE.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:03.852
BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.621
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE BILL AS

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.655
CURRENTLY PROPOSED I KNOW OUR

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:07.990
TIME IS LIMITED SO I'D LIKE TO

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.259
FOCUS ON ONE OUR BIGGEST CONCERN

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:11.794
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.895
AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:13.962
PROFITS TO THE BILL AND CENTER

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.732
JACKSON POINTED OUT SEXUAL

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:17.266
VIOLENCE REMAINS A SERIOUS

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:17.733
PROBLEM.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.301
ON CAMPUSES BUT WHAT DOESN'T GET

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:20.936
AS MUCH ATTENTION IS THE WORK OF

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.705
CAMPUS TITLE NINE COORDINATORS

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:24.039
AND OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.474
INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.309
INVESTIGATING AND REMEDIATING

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.277
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.411
AND WHO ARE COMMITTED TO

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.013
ENSURING A FAIR PROCESS FOR ALL

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.314
STUDENTS.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:33.248
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OTHER

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.717
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:35.818
BUT HAVING MET THE TITLE NINE

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.853
TEAMS AT OUR TWENTY THREE

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.888
CAMPUSES -- WHICH WERE CREATED

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.190
WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL FUNDING

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.591
VIRTUALLY FROM SCRATCH OVER THE

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.259
PAST SEVERAL YEARS I CAN TELL

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.661
YOU THAT THESE ARE CONSCIENTIOUS

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.563
PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE LAW AND

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.630
THE POLICIES IMPLEMENTING IT.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.299
WHEN THEY GO TO WORK THEY KNOW

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.400
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT DESPITE

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:52.568
THEIR BEST EFFORTS IT WILL BE

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.403
PART OF A LAWSUIT FILED BY AN

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.138
ATTORNEY FOR A COMPLAINANT FOR

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.306
RESPONDENT WERE BOTH?

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.807
THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:04.179
BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.114
IT IS A FACT OF LIFE OF COURSE

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:05.714
IN TITLE NINE PROVIDES A RIGHT

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:06.348
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AS TO

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.249
THE CALIFORNIA EQUITY AND HIGHER

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.417
EDUCATION ACT.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:09.618
BOTH OF THESE STATUTES EVER

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.919
FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.588
PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AND

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.022
ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:15.324
EDUCATION.

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.526
BY CONTRAST SB FOUR NINETY

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:18.927
THREES PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.496
ENSURES THAT IT IS MORE

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:20.996
ANALOGOUS TO A SET OF

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.598
ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS TO

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.166
TIE IN A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:31.440
TO A BILL OF SUCH BREATH -- NO

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.008
OFFENSE MISTER HATHAWAY -- I

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.209
SHOULD ADD THAT LITIGATION IS

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.345
COSTLY ON THE STUDENTS.

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.313
FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY AND

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.982
FAVORS THOSE WITH GREATER

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.483
RESOURCES.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.918
OUT ONE LAST POINT IF I COULD --

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.586
THE MOST RECENT MOCK UP OF THE

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:46.054
BILL PROPOSES THAT LITIGANTS BE

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:47.790
REQUIRED TO SHOW INJURY WHILE WE

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.291
APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS IN THE

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.659
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.094
THE CHANGES RESPECTFULLY DO NOT

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.729
ADEQUATELY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:56.965

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.992
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.093
ADDRESS.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.330
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- THAT

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:44.967
AFFECT SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS --

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.336
BUT I DID WANT TO COMMENT

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:50.739
REGARDING THE STUDENT THE CHIP

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.007

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:58.213
YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR AND I YOU

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.614
KNOW I I STRUGGLE.

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.383
WITH THIS BILL.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.884
AS I DID WITH YOUR PREVIOUS

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:06.555
LEGISLATION -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.123
I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH WHAT

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:11.360
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS.

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:14.029
FOR FAR TOO LONG -- VICTIMS

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:16.598
HAVEN'T FELT COMFORTABLE COMING

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:17.666
FORWARD.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.901
BECAUSE OF THE BURDENSOME.

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:23.171
SAYS BECAUSE OF STIGMA AND OTHER

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.906
THINGS THAT ARE ARE PRESENT --

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:26.308
ONCOLOGY CAN'T BUT NOT JUST ON

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.443
COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND IN A LOT OF

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.713
DIFFERENT ASPECTS RIGHT -- THE

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.015
YOU KNOW THE PUBLICITY AND

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.483
EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:38.053
THE PRESSURES -- AND SO I THINK

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.221
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THE

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:41.423
MOTIVATION OBVIOUSLY BEHIND

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.291
WANTING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:45.293
DO FEEL COMFORTABLE.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.363
COMING FORWARD -- IN THIS CASE

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:52.634
ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:54.603
BUT AB AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.437
WE HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.872
THINGS GOING ON ONE WE STILL

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.240
DON'T REALLY HAVE.

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.442
CLEAR DIRECTION ON TITLE NINE

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.511
REGULATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.479
SO THAT'S STILL A SHIFTING

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:05.881
LANDSCAPE AS IT IS.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:06.882
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.850
KNOW WHAT ARE THOSE FINAL

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.218
REGULATIONS BEFORE.

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:12.988
MAY WE DELVE INTO THIS SPACE.

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.589
AND ARE THEY GONNA BE LOOPHOLES

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:16.358
CREATED BY US CREATING SOME SORT

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.592
OF STANDARD.

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:18.693
AND OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE THEY

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.897
GONNA HAVE TO BE FORCED TO WHAT

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:25.467
STANDARD THEY COMPLY WITH -- OR

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:26.334
DO THEY GET SUED.

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.702
FOR FOLLOWING ONE STANDARD BUT

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:30.972
NOT FALL IN THE OTHER -- AND

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.074
THEN I THINK MAYBE MORE

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.309
FUNDAMENTALLY IN AND FOR US IN

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.610
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.679
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING DUE

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.781
PROCESS.

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.951
BECAUSE ON THE RESPONDENTS SIDE.

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:43.585
THESE ARE.

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.887
JUST AS THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:48.356
ALLEGATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:50.025
VERY SERIOUSLY -- FOR THE

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.160
VICTIMS IT ALSO HAS TO BE TAKEN

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.995
VERY SERIOUSLY THAT WE PROVIDE

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.997
FULL DUE PROCESS FOR THE PERSON

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:56.798
THAT'S BEING ACCUSED

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:57.099
[inaudible]

01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:59.901
AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT UNDER

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.503
THESE RULES.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.637
YOU KNOW WE'RE CHANGING THE

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:05.040
STANDARD OF EVIDENCE.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.675
WERE CHANGING IN THE ABILITY TO

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.743
GET AN APPEAL.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.245
AND MAYBE MORE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.180
WERE TAKEN AWAY THE RIGHT TO

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.682
DIRECTLY CROSS EXAMINE.

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:18.420
WITNESSES -- AND THE VICTIM AS

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.021
MUCH AS I KNOW THAT HAVING TO

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:23.492
TESTIFY AND BE CROSS EXAMINED.

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:25.627
I COULD IMAGINE HAVING TO BE IN

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.429
THAT SITUATION RIGHT.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:28.563
BUT NONE THE LESS ONE OF OUR

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.532
FUNDAMENTAL.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.167
YOU KNOW PRINCIPLES -- IN THIS

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.869
COUNTRY AND UNDER OUR RULE OF

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:34.970
LAW.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.438
IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.073
CRIME YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.208
CONFRONT THOSE WHO ARE WITNESSES

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.244
AGAINST YOU -- IN THAT YOU HAVE

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.979
THOSE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:47.015
PLACE -- TO HELP INSURE THAT

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:48.383
THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.186
INNOCENCE AND THAT YOU'RE.

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.521
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN.

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.689
GUILTY -- AND SO THAT I THINK

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.091
THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:56.925
HAVE IS.

01:19:56.992 --> 01:20:00.061
IS OVER YOU KNOW HOW WE ENSURING.

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.329
THAT WE HAVE THAT DO PRESS

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.397
RECOGNIZES IN A CRIMINAL

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.166
PROCEEDING I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:05.000
HOWEVER.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:08.303
YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.138
THIS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT -- WE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.873
ALL LOVE THE ABILITY TO GET A

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.508
GOOD EDUCATION AND HOW WE WANT

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.010
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THIS.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.745
STATE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:18.246
QUALITY EDUCATION.

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.649
SO THE TAKING OF THAT AWAY IS

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.517
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.720
SERIOUS AND NOT TO MENTION.

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.089
IF YOU ARE FOUND GUILTY BY THIS

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.158
BODY.

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.960
ALL OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:34.763
WITH THAT RIGHT -- AND IF YOU

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.198
WERE TRULY INNOCENT AND FELT

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:37.365
LIKE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE FULL

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:41.536
OPPORTUNITY. TO PUT ON YOUR CASE

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:45.073
TO PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE --

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.408
THAT'S SIGNIFICAN I THINK THAT'S

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.976
WHERE THE GOVERNOR WAS GOVERNOR

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.078
BROWN -- WHEN HE VETOED

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.713
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR?

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.981
IS THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.216
TO REALLY ENSURE THAT DUE

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.751
PROCESS PROTECTION.

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:57.886
IS IS PART OF THIS.

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.354
WHILE ALSO TAKING CARE OF THE

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.956
THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATION WHICH

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.490
IS A VICTIMS.

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:03.825
HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:05.660
FOR BUT THEIR CLAIM SO MAYBE YOU

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:06.294
CAN JUST SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.363
CHARITIES -- CERTAINLY AND THIS

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.865
BILL IS ALL ABOUT TO PROCESS.

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:11.933
AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.702
COMMENTS EDUCATIONAL

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:16.605
INSTITUTIONS ARE EDUCATIONAL

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:18.406
INSTITUTIONS THEY'RE NOT COURTS

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:19.407
OF LAW.

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.543
OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.411
PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN WOEFULLY

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.280
LACKING WHEN IT COMES TO THE TO

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.982
THE PROTECTIONS OF TITLE NINE

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.850
AND SO AT IN THE PAST COUPLE

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.920
YEARS -- THIS HAS BECOME A FOCAL

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:35.023
POINT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.292
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- AFTER

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:40.028
TWO YEARS OF ROBUST RESEARCH

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.830
CAME OUT WITH A WHAT THEY CALL

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.265
THE DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER.

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.734
WHICH WAS A DESIGNED TO GIVE THE

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.302
PARAMETERS TO CREATE THE

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:49.671
PARAMETERS OF WHAT DUE PROCESS

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.707
WAS TO BE AND HOW TITLE NINE WAS

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:54.276
TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:57.379
IT WAS A GUN WITH WHAT WAS THAT

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:58.446
ME BECAUSE I STILL AM AND

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.948
CONFUSED BY THE DEAR COLLEAGUES

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:02.350
IS THAT ACTUALLY A REGULATION.

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.918
IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE A REALLY

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.487
HALF MEASURE FROM YOU KNOW IT

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.022
WAS A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT TO THE

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:09.424
UNIVERSITIES AND IT WAS DESIGNED

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:15.030
TO CREATE A DUE PROCESS --

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.599
CONSTRUCT.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.868
OSAP BUT EXCUSE ME YOU'RE NOT.

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:20.168
THANK YOU.

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.202
I IT WAS A IT WAS A GUIDANCE IT

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.570
WAS A DOCUMENT TO GUIDE OUR

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:25.006
UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE AS WE ALL

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.174
KNOW UP UNTIL.

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:27.876
OF WELL EVEN EXISTING NOW

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.811
THERE'S REALLY BEEN NO DIRECTION

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.579
AS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:33.481
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT SO THIS WAS

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.750
A DOCUMENT. TO GUIDE

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.520
UNIVERSITIES WHAT HAPPENED IS

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.455
DURING THE RAID DURING THE

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.190
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.558
MR TRUMP.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:46.127
HAS PULLED THIS BACK HIS CURRENT

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.662
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION IS MADE

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:50.198
IT CLEAR THAT SHE THINKS MOST OF

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:51.633
THESE CLAIMS ARE FALSE.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.336
AND HAS INDICATED HER INTENTION

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.271
TO PULL THE PLUG IF YOU WILL ON

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:58.540
THIS GUIDANCE PROCESS AND CREATE

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:00.442
HER OWN VERSION OF WHAT DUE

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.776
PROCESS SHOULD BE.

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.278
SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED THIS

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:04.946
BILL HE SAID YOU KNOW I'D LIKE

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.848
TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:09.017
CREATING A SYSTEM THAT WILL

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:11.386
PROVIDE THIS TO PROCESS.

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.421
THAT'S WHAT HE DID AND MOST OF

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.824
THE BILL THAT YOU SEE HERE TODAY

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.460
IS BASEDUPON THE DIRECTIVES

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.195
THAT WERE GIVEN BY THE

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.464
GOVERNOR'S THREE PERSON PANEL OF

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:25.100
EXPERTS ALL EXTRAORDINARILY.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.535
QUALIFIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.070
AND THAT WE'VE INCORPORATED IN

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.940
THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.975
THAT THE TITLE -- NINE

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:36.211
REDEFINITION DAD IS BEEN

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:38.713
PROPOSED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.749
INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT I BELIEVE

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:43.151
THE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA IS AND

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.285
SHOULD BE.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.288
DEALING WITH A TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:49.157
THIS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT WE

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:53.261
HAVE ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.796
AGAIN I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.765
IMPORTANT IN YOU YOU MENTIONED

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:57.098
IT YOURSELF.

01:23:57.165 --> 01:24:00.468
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.169
PROCEEDING.

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:01.936
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.138
CRITICAL IT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.540
PROCEEDING BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT.

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.143
ONE AND I AS A SOMEONE WHO

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.844
PRACTICED LAW FOR OVER TWENTY

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.746
YEARS APPRECIATE AND I'M

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.314
COMMITTED TO THE CONCEPT OF

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:15.150
FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS AND

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.618
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.720
IT REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE AN

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.622
INDEPENDENT WE HAVE IMPARTIAL

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.257
HEARINGS WE HAVE.

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:24.893
AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDER WHO

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:27.295
MAKES A DETERMINATION BASED UPON

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.164
ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:30.665
PRESENTED BY BOTH SIDES.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.667
NOW SOME OF THE STORIES THAT

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.235
HAPPENED  FEW YEARS AGO WERE

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.304
THAT BECAUSE UNIVERSITIES DIDN'T

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:38.006
HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE THEY

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.674
WOULD JUST ASSUME WELL SOMEONE'S

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.009
MADE A CLAIM AND YOU'RE OUT OF

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.845
SCHOOL -- AND THAT ISN'T THE

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.747
SYSTEM THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.582
HERE THE SYSTEM WE'RE DEVELOPING

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.417
HERE IS THAT THEIR ALLEGATIONS

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.519
MADE THAT WHEN A VICTIM COMES

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.087
FORWARD SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES OR

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.189
HAS BEEN.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.590
A SEXUALLY.

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.892
ASSAULTED OR RAPED THAT THEY ARE

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.794
GIVEN THE KIND OF CARE THAT WE

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:01.830
KNOW VICTIMS HAVE NOW WE DIDN'T

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:02.831
BRING.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.866
TODAY TO TESTIFY SOME OF THE

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.168
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.737
WHO STORIES WOULD TEAR AT YOUR

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:10.972
HEART STRINGS TO AND THE

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.474
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THEY'VE BEEN

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.576
THROUGH THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OF

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:17.212
THESE CRIMES.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.080
WHO LEAVE COLLEGE?

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:19.714
THEY LEAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.850
DISTRAUGHT AT HAVING TO CONFRONT

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:24.018
THERE ARE THERE THE RAPIST THEIR

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:24.986
ABUSER.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.155
SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.490
WE'RE NOW I MEAN WE'RE TRYING TO

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.225
DO THINGS TO STOP THIS WE'VE GOT

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.759
YES MEANS YES ON OUR COLLEGE

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.127
CAMPUSES SO THAT WE'RE TEACHING

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:33.761
ABOUT.

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.330
INFORMED CONSENT TRYING TO

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.465
CHANGE THE CULTURE OF RAPE ON

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.934
CAMPUS BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WHEN

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:41.636
WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:42.770
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.739
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.774
THERE WERE IS NOW A PROCESS THAT

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.376
HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO THE

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:49.878
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:51.813
EXAMPLE IS DONEI THINK A VERY

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.249
SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED JOB

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.683
DEALING WITH THIS TO PROVIDE

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:57.151
THAT TO PROCESS.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:59.287
LET ME JUST THROW OUT THE NOTION

01:25:59.354 --> 01:25:59.988
THAT.

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:02.156
PLAGIARISM IS ENDED IT IS AN

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.125
OFFENCE ON COLLEGE THAT CAN GET

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.627
YOU BOOTED OUT.

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:07.729
BUT WE AND WE HAVE IN PLACE

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.397
CERTAIN SYSTEMS FOR THAT WHICH

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:10.498
AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR AS

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.467
PROTECTIVE AS WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.735
HERE BUT THAT'S AN

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.336
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.205
THAT'S A PROCEEDING WHERE

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:19.507
SOMEONE CAN BE -- FORCED OUT OF

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.276
THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE SO

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:22.010
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:23.545
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS WE'RE

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.246
NOT TALKING ABOUT A CRIMINAL

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.848
PROCEEDING WHERE YOU HAVE PROOF

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:28.416
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.418
THAT'S IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO TO

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.386
A COURT.

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.921
AND MOST OF THESE VICTIMS

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.255
IRONICALLY DO NOT.

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:37.325
THEY TRUST WANT TO BE FREE OF

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.294
THEIR ACCUSER THEY WANT TO BE

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.195
VINDICATED FROM THIS MOST OF

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:43.097
THESE FOLKS DON'T NECESSARILY

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:45.066
EVEN WANT THEM TO BE THROWN OUT

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:45.767
OF SCHOOL.

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.902
BUT THERE BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.871
TO DO NOW IS GET A HANDLE ON

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:52.206
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OF THE VICTIM

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.742
WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE AND HOW

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:57.612
WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS FAIR

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.513
TO EVERYONE.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.415
THE ACCUSED AND THE ACCUSERS

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.617
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.586
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.588
A WORKING ON CONCERNS THAT WE'VE

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.156
HAD HERE TODAY WE'VE GOT

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:09.924
AMENDMENTS THAT -- EQUAL RIGHTS

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.993
ADVOCATES HAS BEEN WORKING ON

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.462
WITH MY A STAFF -- THAT WILL

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.965
CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.633
OF THOSE ISSUES TO GET TO THAT

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.069
SWEET SPOT I THINK WE ARE.

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:23.071
VERY CLOSE IF NOT THERE I THINK

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:24.639
NOW WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.407
PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT BUT

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.676
THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WE NEED

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.945
TO PUT IN PLACE FOR THOSE WHO

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:31.713
ARE WHO.

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:32.580
CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:35.216
FALSELY ACCUSED AS WELL AS

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:37.452
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:40.321
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON OUR COLLEGE

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.090
CAMPUSES IN WITH THAT STUFF.

01:27:42.156 --> 01:27:43.358
I HOPE THAT THAT RESPONSE YOUR

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.692
QUESTION NOW IS IS VERY

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.461
SPONSORED BUT JUST REALLY

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:49.564

PROTECTING DUE PROCESS IN THESE

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:55.937
[inaudible]

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.238
CDNS SO.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.906
I THINK A LOT OF THESE CASES ARE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:01.576
GONNA INVOLVE PRIMARILY WITNESS

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:02.910
TESTIMONY.

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.445
FROM THE VICTIM AND THE

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:07.649
RESPONDENT -- AND THEN ANY

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.283
WITNESSES THAT CAN TESTIFIED

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:11.019
OTHER THING SO HAVING IN PLACE

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.754
THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:13.921
WITNESSES.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.123
WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE A PRETTY

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:17.058

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.095
UNDER THE VETERAN LANGUAGE AS I

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.530
UNDERSTAND IT YOU.

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:24.265
DON'T ALLOW FOR DIRECT CROSS

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:26.334
EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES IS THAT

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:26.934
CORRECT.

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:28.236
YEAH I CAN RESPOND TO THAT --

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:30.104
THE THE BILL PROVIDES -- FOR

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.606
LIVE CROSS EXAMINATION AND

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:32.607
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE

CASE THAT MR GALLAGHER MENTIONED --

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.544
SO THE BILL ALLOWS THE NEUTRAL

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.379
JUDICATA DECISION MAKER TO

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.014
PRESENT QUESTIONS TO BOTH

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:41.949
PARTIES -- THAT THE OTHER PARTY

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.551
REQUESTS AND THAT CAN BE DONE IN

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.353
A LIVE SETTING IT'S NOT DIRECT

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.954
WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED BY ALL THE

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:48.022
OTHERS THE REASON FOR THAT

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:49.223

BROWN SOUTH FORCE.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.528
IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT --

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.796
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:57.131
HAVE BEEN SEVERELY ABUSE WHEN

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:57.665
THEY ARE BEING QUESTIONED

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.367
DIRECTLY BY EITHER THE PERSON

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.368
WHO IS THEY ARE ACCUSING OF

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.503
RAPING THEM OR THAT PERSON'S

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.905
ADVISER OR OR LEGAL

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.006
REPRESENTATIVE.

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.607
A SERVICE PROVIDES THE OF

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:07.842
RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS THE

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.311
PERSON MAKING THE ALLEGATION

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:10.945
ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO ASK

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.014
ABOUT ANOTHER ARBITRATOR THROUGH

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:18.920
QUESTIONS IMAGES THE NEUTRAL --

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.922
INVESTIGATOR HA.

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:22.490
AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH CASE

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:23.991
THE CASE LAW THAT.

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:24.659
ON TO THAT.

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:25.660
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.195
A CASE IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST IN

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:27.829
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS WHERE

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:28.696
SOMEONE HAS BEEN DIRECTLY CROSS

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:29.430
EXAMINED.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:30.331
IN A AND A SETTING OTHER THAN

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.066
STAND WILL STAND FOR DOESN'T

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.202
EVEN HAVE IT -- SO THERE IS

01:29:34.268 --> 01:29:36.003
THERE IT REQUIRES DIRECT CROSS

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.772
EXAMINATION THIS BILL REFERS TO

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:39.440
LIVE CROSS EXAMINATION BUT IT'S

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.476
NOT LIFE IT COULDN'T BE BETTER

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:42.577
IT'S HAVING TO WRITE DOWN A

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.912
QUESTION HAVING IT SUBMITTED TO

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:45.947
ANOTHER PERSON WHO CAN RULE ON

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:47.515
IT SUBMITTED TO THE WITNESS.

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.250
WHO CAN ALSO DECIDE NOT TO

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:50.785
ANSWER IT NOT ONLY NOT DECIDE

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:51.919
NOT TO ENTRANCE AT REFUSED TO

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.521
ANSWER BUT OBJECT TO IT ON SOME

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.689
TYPE OF GROUNDS?

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:56.424
IT IS NOT THE TYPE OF BACK AND

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.192
FORTH IS IF HIS KERING HERE

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.895
WHERE IDEAS ARE EXPRESSED IN THE

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.263
IN THE TRUTH COULD COME OUT IT'S

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.631
THE REACTION TO SOMEBODY'S

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:05.166
QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT YOU

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.367
CHANGE YOUR TESTIMONY.

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.002
HOW COME YOU TOLD THIS PERSON

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.504
THAT AND THEY TOLD THIS PERSON

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.139
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:12.707
AND IT'S THAT INFORMATION THAT

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.109
CAN ONLY COME OUT THROUGH LIFE?

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:17.078
BACK AND FORTH DIALOGUE ANY CAN

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.913
BE DONE BY VIDEO BUT I ALSO

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:23.050
WANTED TO MENTION QUICKLY THE

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:26.254
PLAGIARISM ISSUE.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.321
AND I DOUBT ARE GONNA THAT YEAH

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.523
THANK.

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:29.223
YOU AND IF I GO TO INDICATE

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.525
UNDER THE DOE CASE WHICH WAS

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.359
REFERRED.

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.093
TO SETS FORTH THE ROAD THE

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.895
REQUIREMENT OF EXAMINATION THAT

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.329
THAT IS IN THIS BILL.

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.031
SO WE'RE FOLLOWING THE CASE LAW

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:37.665
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.100
HERE AGAIN THIS IS NOT A

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.635
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.036
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:44.305
PROCEEDING AND FOLLOWING THE

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.707
REQUIREMENTS OF DOUGH THE

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:48.376
ACCUSED MAY CROSS EXAMINE.

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:49.777
THOSE WITNESSES DIRECTLY OR

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.646
INDIRECTLY AT A HEARING WHICH

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:53.047
THE IT WITNESSES APPEAR IN

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.249
PERSON OR BY OTHER MEANS VIDEO

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:56.284
CONFERENCING.

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:58.452
BEFORE A NEUTRAL ADJUDICATOR

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.321
WITH THE POWER INDEPENDENTLY TO

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.023
FIND FACTS TO MAKE CREDIBILITY

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:04.725
ASSESSMENTS THAT'S THE LAW.

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:08.896
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FALLS.

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:09.730
RIGHT BUT IF IF IF YOU CAN'T ASK

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.766
THE QUESTION.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:12.767
YEAH BECAUSE IT SAYS AT THE

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.302
HEARING IN WHICH THE WITNESSES

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:16.037
APPEAR IN PERSON UNDER DUB

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:17.338
VERSES ALI AND I WOULD ALSO

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:18.739
POINT OUT THAT DOUGH.

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.741
MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT EVEN

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:21.209
THOUGH THIS IS A CIVIL

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.276
PROCEEDING.

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.645
THIS HAS LIKE SEMI CRIMINAL

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:26.581
IMPLICATIONS AND AND THE AND THE

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.149
READ AND THE WHOLE REASONING.

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.917
BEHIND DOES IT MAYBE YOU DO IS

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:31.752
ESSENTIALLY THAT YOU DO HAVE TO

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:32.286
HAVE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:31:32.353 --> 01:31:34.388
STANDARD. TO PROTECT DUE PROCESS

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.590
RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.325
THAT'S WHY WE PUT THOSE

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:38.926
STANDARDS IN THERE I DON'T KNOW

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:39.560
AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND I DO.

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.195
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.763
GIVE THE QUESTION TO THE

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:46.767
ARBITRATOR -- NOT ARBITRATOR BUT

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:47.602
THE ADJUDICATOR.

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:48.202
THEY WOULD RULE ON WHETHER NOT

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.070
THAT QUESTION IS ALLOWED TO BE

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.404
ASKED WHICH THAT WOULD NEVER BE

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:52.139
THE CASE IN A CROSS EXAM

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:53.074
NORMALLY.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.642
WELL IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.244
OBJECT TO A QUESTION IF YOU

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.011
COULD NOW THAT THE LORD OUR GOD

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:58.079
JIM THE JUDGE CAN SAY YOUR

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:00.848
OBJECTION IS SUSTAINEDBUT NOT

01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:02.316
SEPARATELY FROM.

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:04.151
WHERE THE LIVE WITNESSES BE ABLE

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:05.453
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DO YOU

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:06.921
UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU WOULD ASK

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.489
THE QUESTION?

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.124
AND SOMEONE COULD OBJECT THE OF

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.193
THE ATTORNEY COULD OBJECT TO THE

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.729
QUESTION -- AND IF THE OBJECTION

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.130
AS OF HELD IN THE QUESTIONS

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.633
WITHDRAWN RIGHT BUT ASSUMING

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.301
THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTION THEN

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.836
IT'S NOT UP TO THE THE

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.704
ADJUDICATOR TO ANSWER ASK THE

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.339
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:27.141
QUESTION IS PROPER OR NOT.

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:29.010
THE PERSON GETS TO ASK THE

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.112
QUESTION HAVE A RESPONSE WEATHER

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:32.480
COULD BE BY VIDEO.

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:34.482
CONFERENCE SEEN.

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:36.050
AT THE HEARING RIGHT AND WHAT

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.451
I'M HEARING HERE IS THAT THAT

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:38.786
WOULD NOT BE THE CASE YOU HAVE

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:39.620
TO GIVE THESE QUESTIONS IN

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:42.523
ADVANCE. TO THE ADJUDICATOR

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:43.624
WHICH MAKES IT TO ME SOUND LIKE

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:45.526
IT'S NOT.

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.228
THE SAME TYPE OF PROCEEDING DOES

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:48.496
THAT MAKE SENSE.

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:50.531
WELL AGAIN IT'S A PROCEEDING

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:52.566
THAT TRIES TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:54.802
FREQUENTLY A VICTIM IS BADGERED

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:58.706
BY A GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.074
AND THAT THIS IT HAS.

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.276
LEAD TO VICTIMS BEING UNWILLING

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:04.111
TO STEP FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S A

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:04.946
FURTHER.

01:33:05.012 --> 01:33:06.847
HARASSMENT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.549
TRYING TO FIND HERE IS AN

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:11.452
APPROPRIATE HAPPY MEDIUM SO THAT

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:14.021
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.723
CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.693
STEP FORWARD WITHOUT SUFFERING A

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:21.095
YET AGAIN THE HARASSMENT THE THE

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.530
ASSAULT.

01:33:22.596 --> 01:33:24.799
THAT TOOK A GOOD CROSS EXAMINER

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:27.034
GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY -- IS

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.669
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO PROPOSE AND

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.304
THAT IT YOU KNOW IF THEY GO TO A

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:31.772
CRIMINAL COURT.

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.674
THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF BUT THIS

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:36.410
IS NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:37.712
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS FOLLOW THE

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:40.281
DIRECTIVES -- I GUESS YOU COULD

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.515
ARGUE WITH THAT UP THE YOU THE

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:43.851
KAZOO BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THE

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.920
PROPOSED A OF PROOF OF

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:48.122
PROVISIONS OF DOLE VERSUS ALLEY

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.857
WHICH WAS MENTIONED BY.

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.192
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE AND WE'VE

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:53.561
INCORPORATED THEM INTO THIS BILL

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.529
BUT THERE HAS TO BE AGAIN

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:56.664
THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.766
WHO PROBABLY CAN DECIDE WHETHER

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:00.468
OR NOT THAT THAT QUESTION.

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:06.707
IS TOO PROVOCATIVE IS TO COME --

01:34:06.774 --> 01:34:07.541
INTIMIDATING.

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:10.277
OF FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE TO ANSWER

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:10.978
I MEAN.

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:13.381
L. AS A AS A PROSECUTOR I WAS IN

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.782
COURT WHEN A DEFENSE ATTORNEY

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:17.218
WAS ASKING A RAPE VICTIM HOW DID

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.887
SHE KNOW SHE WAS RAPED -- AND

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:22.590
AND ATTEMPT TO RELIVE THAT

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.125
EXPERIENCE.

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.227
IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING AND

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:28.129
THAT'S IN A CRIMINAL CASE THESE

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:30.064
THESE ARE NOT CRIMINAL CASES WE

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.500
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.335
ADJUDICATOR WHO IS GOING TO

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:36.904
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT.

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:39.373
BY THE FAX BY THE QUESTIONING BY

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.142
THE DEMEANOR OF THE WITNESSES

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.511
THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIM OR NOT

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.813
FOR PURPOSES OF SUBSEQUENT

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.915
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHETHER

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:49.283
IT'S FORCING SOMEONE OUGHT TO

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:51.018
SCHOOL FOR A SEMESTER FORCING

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:53.621
THEY MOVING INTO ANOTHER DORM.

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:55.589
WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS IT IS

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:57.691
DEEMED APPROPRIATE THESE ARE NOT

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.360
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS WE'RE

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:02.329
TALKING ABOUT LIFE ON A COLLEGE

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:05.166
CAMPUS.

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:06.067
I THINK I WOULD IS JUST AND BY

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:08.002
SAYING AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.570
YOU'RE SAYING I THINK THAT.

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:10.838
WE SHOULD TRY TO PUT SOME MORE

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.440
WORK INTO ENSURING.

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:14.141
THAT DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:17.445
THERE AND I I THINK WE ALL AGREE

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.180
LIKE I CERTAINLY WANT TO CREATE.

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:21.048
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:21.615
GOING TO BE WILLING TO COME

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:22.683
FORWARD.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:26.587
WITH THEIR CLAIMS AND AND WE CAN

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:29.690
BACK ON DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WE ALL

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:32.960
HAVE I THINK WE CAN ALL DO. TO

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.229
OF A JUDGE WHO WAS A DEFENSE

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:35.830
ATTORNEY WHEN YOUR LONG TIME

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:36.964
WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF A SERIOUS

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:39.667
CRIME OR A SERIOUS OFFENSE SUCH

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:42.236
AS THIS AND DOE DOE DOES SAY HEY

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.472
YOU NEED STRONGER PROTECTIONS IN

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:46.674
THESE CASES -- YOU WANT A GOOD

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.142
DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND YOU WANT

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:50.744
SOMEONE TO ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.313
TO HELP.

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.681
INSURE THAT YOUR YOUR CASES IS

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:56.016
FULLY HEARD AND SO I THINK THAT

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.585
IS ONE ISSUE THAT WE THAT WE MAY

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:59.820
NEED TO WORK THROUGH AND THEN I

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.455
WOULD ALSO SAY THE STANDARD OF

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.224
EVIDENCE IN THE WORST PUTTING

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.757
THAT PREPONDERANCE OF THE

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.159
EVIDENCE.

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:07.461
YEAH THAT'S SORT OF LIKE A

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.763
THAT'S CORRECT YEAH VERY YEAH.

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.232
AND WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF A

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.766
VERY SERIOUS.

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:13.934
FRAN IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.035
PROCEEDING WE'RE NOT PUTTING

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:17.238
ANYBODY IN JAIL OR PRISON FOR

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.439
THIS THIS ANY OTHER INTEREST

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.707
CONSEQUENCES I THINK THEY'RE

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.809
ALWAYS SERIES CONSEQUENCES AS

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:23.544
THERE ARE TO PLAGIARISM AS I

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.012
MENTIONED AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.514
I THINK WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.082
TO DISAGREE PHILOSOPHICALLY

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.884
THANK YOU THIS IS AWFUL I THANK

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:31.218
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD --

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.053
AND IT'S DEVASTATING TO HEAR

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.655
ABOUT ANYBODY WHO IS FALSELY

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.357
ACCUSED IN ANY SITUATION I TAKE

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.925
THAT VERY SERIOUSLY.

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:39.326
BUT IF WE HAD THIS MUCH

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.462
CONVERSATION FOR DECADES ABOUT

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:45.032
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN -- VIOLATED

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.600
AND GREAT AND ASSAULTED ON

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:47.801
CAMPUS.

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:51.305
AT AS WE'RE GIVING DEFENDANTS --

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:52.540
UP I GUESS YOU'RE NOT DEFENDANTS

01:36:52.606 --> 01:36:53.807
NOT CRIMINAL RIGHT NOW THEN WE

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.409
WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.945
THE TRUTH IS THAT THAT FOR

01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:00.915
GENERATIONS WOMEN IN PARTICULAR

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:01.682
I I KNOW CAN GO BOTH WAYS BUT

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:04.118
WOMEN HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:09.590
SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS WITH

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:11.959
VERY LITTLE -- NOTICE EVEN AT

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:12.493
AND IT HASN'T BEEN TAKEN

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.427
SERIOUSLY AND I'M SORRY THE

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:14.061
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT ANY OF US

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.230
WHO WENT TO COLLEGE CAN TELL YOU

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.232
HOW MANY OF OUR FRIENDS -- WHERE

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:21.335
WERE GIVEN DRINKS TO GET DRUNK

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.037
TO TAKE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:24.371
TO BEING PRESSURED TO IN THIS

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:25.973
HAS HAPPENED AND IT AFFECTS

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.508
THEIR ENTIRE LIFE?

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:28.776
IN OVERWHELMINGLY THE NUMBERS

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:30.611
WILL SAY FALSE ALLEGATIONS ARE

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:33.347
VERY SMALL BY COMPARISON SO.

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:36.016
IF THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS.

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:38.252
TWEAKS YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:40.221
AUTHOR WORKS WITH THOSE BUT THIS

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:43.691
IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I GET

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.326
THE FEAR OF THE PEOPLE BEING

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:47.361
FALSE ACCUSED I HAVE FIVE KIDS

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.329
FORMER VOICE.

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:50.197
RIGHT THERE THE ALL INNER IN

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:52.199
COLLEGE I I GOT OR HOPEFULLY

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.100
MAYBE NOT.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:57.238
BE REALLY EXPENSIVE -- BUT I'M A

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:58.672
DAUGHTER WHO WHO WENT TO COLLEGE.

01:37:58.739 --> 01:38:00.441
EN EN I'M SORRY I WANT THINGS TO

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:02.743
CHANGE IT'S TIME FOR THINGS TO

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.912
CHANGE AND IT IS IT WHAT WHAT WE

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:05.913
HAVE PUT UP WITH.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.381
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CROSS

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:15.616
DIPPING OF FACT FINDING FOR THE

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:17.017
PURPOSE OF MISTER HEARING IS

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:18.585
DIFFERENT THAN THE PURPOSE OF

CROSS EXAMINATION A COMMA

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:20.187
PROCEEDING.

AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:22.556
THAT'S THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:25.526
HERE -- AND ANYONE -- I THINK

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:26.560
THAT.

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:29.730
THE THE THE PURPOSE OF A OF

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.298
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING IN

THIS CONTEXT IS NOT ONLY TO GET

01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:35.803
THE FACTS ABOUT -- BUT MAY OR

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.137

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:38.572
THERE'S OVER OVER ARCHING

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.007
CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY ON THE

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:42.710
GOES.

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.011
TO THE PURPOSE OF THESE KINDS OF

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:46.146
HEARINGS AS WELL ALSO I DO HAVE

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:48.048
ONE QUESTION FOR EITHER THE THE

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:50.551
CHAIR OR THE AUTHOR REGARDING.

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:54.455
THE USE OF PROXIMATE CAUSE --

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.357
I'VE HAD A BILL TOTALLY ON A

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:59.727
DIFFERENT ISSUE WHERE -- WE'VE

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.395
WE CHOSE TO MOVE WITH A

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:03.030
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR STANDARD

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.398
RATHER THAN PROXIMATE CAUSE

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:05.466
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:07.101
COURTS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:08.936
PROXIMATE CAUSE STANDARD.

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:10.637
FOR A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:11.605
GIVE DON'T NEED AN ANSWER RIGHT

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:13.107
NOW BUT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER --

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:14.508
BUT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:15.376
SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED BY

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:16.343
EITHER.

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.711
THE COMMITTEE STAFF OR OR CHAIR

01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:20.781
OR BY THE AUTHOR AS DO YOU

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.783
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR RATHER THAN --

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:24.451
PROXIMATE CAUSE WHICH SEEMS TO

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:24.985
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:25.886
OUTDATED STANDARD.

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.054
WELL WE'LL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT

CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS BILL --

01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:35.262
THERE IS A SWEET SPOT THERE I

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:36.997
THINK WE'RE THERE -- BUT

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:37.965

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:52.379

AND I APPRECIATE THOSE ISSUES

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:55.416
TOO BUT I DO THINK THAT -- WE'RE

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:56.583
AT A POINT NOW WHERE -- WE CAN

01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:57.718
START IMPLEMENTING THIS IT'LL

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.683
WITHIN THE AGENCIES.

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:23.684
WHO?

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:25.352

FOR PROMOTIONS.

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:31.558
AND THEY HAVE A SITUATION THAT

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.894
DISCOURAGES THAT NOW.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.562
THIS CREATES EXCLUDED EMPLOY

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:37.798
ARBITRATION ACT IN ARBITRATION

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.599
IS THE KEY TO WHAT THE BILL

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:42.169
TRIES TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:43.637
IN THE GRANT THAT A TITLE TO

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.839

SATISFACTORY IN THE MULTI REVIEW

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:54.581
PROCESS NOW EXTANT [inaudible]

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:57.751
THAT THE EMPLOYEE.

01:45:57.818 --> 01:46:00.687
AND THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:03.757

01:46:03.824 --> 01:46:06.193
ON ONE ARBITRATOR.

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:08.395
THE ARBITRATOR WOULD.

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:10.664
PINE A LEGALLY BINDING DECISION

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:13.934
WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.001

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:15.302
[inaudible]

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:18.605
WOULD PAY.

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.706
THIS IS KIND OF A LOSER PAY.

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:22.809
DISCIPLINE. TO ENSURE THE JOB

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:26.413
GETS DONE.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.781
THE SECTION TWO DIFFERENT

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:31.752
SECTIONS OF TITLE TO DEFINE.

01:46:31.818 --> 01:46:34.554
WHAT ACTIONS ARE GRIEBEL

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:34.855
[inaudible]

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:39.259
AND IT WOULD TAKE THAT LIST.

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:42.295
AND ALLOW AN EXCLUDED EMPLOYEE

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:43.663
TO REQUEST ARBITRATION.

01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.132

GIVES THE COURT.

01:54:24.657 --> 01:54:26.826
DISCRETION TO GRANT --

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:28.828
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THAT IS TO

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.342
FROM THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION

HOW WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL?

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.111

BILL WE HAVE -- ONE OF THE MOST

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:37.323
COMPLEX AND COMPREHENSIVE SET OF

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:39.458
RULES IN THE NATION WHEN IT

AN EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE IN

02:01:50.469 --> 02:01:52.004
COMPLEX SET OF RULES EVEN MORE

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:54.340
SO WHICH COULD LIKELY END UP IN

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:56.342
MORE MISTAKES.

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:58.344
MORE LITIGATION. ONE NEW ISSUE

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:00.246
THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL.

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:01.814
IS RATE IN THE ANALYSIS HAS THE

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:03.549
A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT AND THAT

02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:07.653
WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE THE OR OR

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:09.321
DELETE THE ONE SECTION OF THE

02:02:09.388 --> 02:02:10.589
THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT AN

02:02:10.656 --> 02:02:12.858
INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS HAD A PAST

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:13.893

02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:15.661
YEARS FOR EMBEZZLEMENT FORGERY

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:22.835
THAT RAISES SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.103
WON THE ELECTION CODE SECTION

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.838
TWENTY A PROHIBITS ANYONE WITH A

TO THE SAME ROLE FOR AN

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:38.584
ASSOCIATION WHOSE BOARD MEMBERS

FINANCIAL PERSONAL EXCEPT TRUCK.

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:44.623
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.958
CREATE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR

02:02:46.025 --> 02:02:47.727
ASSOCIATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:49.161
OBTAIN FROM FIDELITY BOND

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:50.763
INSURANCE WHICH IS NOW A

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:52.531
REQUIRED BY LAW IN OTHER

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:53.933
INSURANCE MATTER SO.

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:58.104
WE THINK THAT THIS -- AMENDMENT.

02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:58.838
CHARACTERIZE THIS TECHNICAL

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.272
ANALYSIS ACTUALLY CREATE

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:02.942
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.543
ASSOCIATIONS ARE ALL AROUND THE

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.778
STATE.

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:07.813
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.447
PEACE THE BILL THAT SHIFTS THE

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.950
BURDEN -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:03:11.016 --> 02:03:12.051
CHALLENGE OF AN ELECTION?

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.819
THE MAY FIRST VERSION OF THIS

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:14.653
BILL.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.756
TOOK IT BACK TO A MORE BALANCED

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:18.624
APPROACH LEAVING THAT DISCRETION

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:20.392
TO THE JUDGE THE VERSION OF THE

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.161
BILL IN FRONT OF YOU NOW SHIPS

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:24.497
THAT BURDEN SO THAT A COURT MUST

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.165
THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION.

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:27.166
IF.

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:28.868
THE ASSOCIATION CANNOT PROVE

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.803
THAT THE MISTAKE I DID NOT HAVE

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.904
AN IMPACT SO NOW THESE

02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:33.672
ASSOCIATIONS ARE IN THE POSITION

02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:34.874
OF ADDITIONAL LITIGATION WHEN

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.809
THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVE A

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:38.811
NEGATIVE SO -- WE DO BELIEVE

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:40.846
THAT THERE IS A AN EASY WAY TO

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:42.381
ADDRESS THIS MORE ELEGANT A WAY

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.016
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF RULES

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:46.252
CHANGING FOR THE ELECTIONS.

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:48.454
AND THAT IS TO REQUIRE ELECTION

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.089
QUALIFICATIONS ELECTION A

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.057
RECOMMENDATION SIMPLY TO BE PART

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.692
OF THE BY LAWS INSTEAD OF PART

02:03:53.759 --> 02:03:55.561
OF THE RULE PROCESS THAT'S

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:56.629
OUTLINED IN DAVIS STERLING.

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:58.330
SO IT'S FOR THOSE REASONS --

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:00.266
THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL AND WILL

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.301

WERE JUST UP PREVIOUSLY LAID OUT

02:04:11.811 --> 02:04:13.479
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:15.247
THAT ALL COSTS AND ASSOCIATION

02:04:15.314 --> 02:04:17.049
ARE BORED BY ALL THE HOMEOWNERS

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:18.984
WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION.

02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:20.886
SO WE DO HAVE CONCERN TO THE

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:23.022
EXTENT THAT YOU.

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:24.223
MAKE THESE THESE ROLES ARE THE

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:25.157
LAWS MORE COMPLEX AND IT

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:26.525
INCREASES COST -- FOR THE

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:27.760
ASSOCIATION IT IS THE OTHER

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:29.295
HOMEOWNERS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:33.299

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:23.868
A ROAD THE PROTECTIONS OF

EXISTING LAW TODAY IT SOMEHOW

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:27.839
SUPERSEDE.

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:30.241
EXISTING LAW -- AND THEN IF THE

02:17:30.308 --> 02:17:31.810
AUTHOR WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:33.745
AS WELL I'M HAPPY -- TO SO THE

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.780
NEW LAW WILL LANGUAGE HAS A

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:37.415
PROVISION THAT INDICATES THAT

02:17:47.692 --> 02:17:49.995
IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT THE GOAL

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:52.430
OF THE LEGISLATION IS.

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:53.765
WE THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT.

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:55.367
THAT RELATES TO SOME COPYRIGHT

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:56.701
DEFENSE THAT WOULD BE WHOLLY IN

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:58.236
APPLICABLE TO ANY COMMERCIAL

02:17:58.303 --> 02:17:59.971
WEBSITE I NOTE THAT.

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:01.806
IN ANY OTHER STATE WHERE WE HAVE

02:18:01.873 --> 02:18:03.041
WORKED ON LEGISLATION THAT

02:18:03.108 --> 02:18:05.143
PROHIBITS DECEPTIVE U. R. L.

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:06.444

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.679
THAT SORT OF CUMBERSOME CARVE

02:18:07.746 --> 02:18:10.915
OUT HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED AND SO

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:13.051
I AGAIN I COULD GO ON AND ON

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:13.718
ABOUT THIS.

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:16.254
I AM HAPPY TO RECITE FURTHER

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:18.857
EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S IN THIS

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.859
ELECTION THE STATUTE.

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:22.394
AS AN EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS WE

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.361
WOULD HAVE TO ALSO PROVE BAD

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:25.530

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:30.035
PUTTING UP A FALSE WEBSITE.

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:32.037
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:35.473
AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE --

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.575
AGAIN WITH IN ON NO PREJUDICE TO

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:39.010

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:39.644
SPONSORS INTENT.

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.546
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE BILL

02:18:41.613 --> 02:18:44.749
BEFORE YOU AS PROPOSED TO BE AN

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:47.285
AMENDED WE THINK REDUCE CONSUMER

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:48.053
PROTECTIONS.

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:50.221
REDUCE THE RIGHTS OF TRADEMARK

HOLDERS AND MAKE IT MORE

02:18:53.958 --> 02:18:56.394
CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO

02:18:56.461 --> 02:18:57.762
ASSERT THOSE RIGHTS AND FOR

02:18:57.829 --> 02:19:01.933
THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSING THE

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:08.006
MEASURE.

02:19:08.073 --> 02:19:09.607
VISIT YOU CAN ASK FOR A LITTLE

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:10.842
BIT OF ELABORATION ON THIS AT

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:12.544
FIRST ME JUST SAY APPRECIATE THE

02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:12.844
THE AUTHOR.

02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.212
OF FOR FOR MOVING FORWARD IN

02:19:14.279 --> 02:19:15.280
THIS AREA I FOR ONE HAVE.

02:19:15.346 --> 02:19:16.548
BEEN VERY CONFUSED AND I TRY TO

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:17.582
BUY TICKETS ONLINE AND I

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:18.683
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ARE TRYING

02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:20.518
TO ADDRESS A REAL PROBLEM HERE --

02:19:20.585 --> 02:19:21.886
AND I DEFINITELY THINK THAT --

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:24.055
THE VERSIONS OF THE BILL UNTIL

02:19:24.122 --> 02:19:26.524
IT CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE --

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.293
WERE WERE CLEAR I HAVE TO MISS I

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:33.732
AM A LITTLE -- I AM ALSO A BIT --

02:19:33.798 --> 02:19:34.599
A PROBABLY CONFUSED ABOUT SOME

02:19:34.666 --> 02:19:35.433
OF THE DIRECTION OF WHERE THE

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:36.534
BILL AS I KNOW THAT THERE'S NEW

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:38.369
LANGUAGE THAT INCREASES.

02:19:38.436 --> 02:19:41.106
AROUND BAD FAITH AND AND THAT TO

02:19:41.172 --> 02:19:43.608
ME I'M I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:44.976
WHETHER -- YOU KNOW WE ARE

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:46.177
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

02:19:46.244 --> 02:19:48.546
PROVE WITHOUT INTENT -- I KNOW

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:49.180
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTION

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:50.415
AROUND.

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:51.516
THE NEW LANGUAGE LIMITING IT TO

02:19:51.583 --> 02:19:53.384
CERTAIN TYPES OF MARKS AND

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:53.952
QUESTIONS AROUND THE FIRST

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:56.521
MEMBER BUT I ALSO WORRY THAT

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:58.656
THERE MIGHT BE A AND NARROWING

02:19:58.723 --> 02:19:59.224
OF THAT.

02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:01.860
I LIKE TO US THE AUTHOR -- WHAT

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:03.228
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IN SOME OF

02:20:03.294 --> 02:20:03.695
THESE QUESTIONS AT THE

02:20:03.762 --> 02:20:05.029
OPPOSITION IS RAISED DO YOU

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:06.731
THINK THERE'S A PATH HERE TO

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:08.666
RESOLVING THESE ISSUES -- BOTH

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:09.834
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:11.736
MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS IS

02:20:11.803 --> 02:20:14.773
CLEAR -- THAT DOESN'T CREATE

02:20:14.839 --> 02:20:16.274
FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES BUT ALSO.

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:17.242
NOT INADVERTENTLY MAKE IT MORE

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:24.983
DIFFICULT TO WHAT TO DO WHAT YOU

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:25.450
ARE TRYING TO DO HERE.

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:27.352
WELL.

02:20:27.418 --> 02:20:29.053
SIR YOU'RE WELCOME TO BUT A LOT

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.189
OF THESE CHANGES COME FOR ME

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:32.824
THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSIST

02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:35.360
YOU IN OUT I WAS GONNA ASK CHAU

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:35.827
JUST GONNA SAY IF IF.

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:36.761
IT SO WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.062
AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE

02:20:38.129 --> 02:20:40.765
OPPOSITION AND CENTER I

02:20:40.832 --> 02:20:41.766
APPRECIATE YOU.

02:20:41.833 --> 02:20:43.201
BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH US ON

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:45.570
THIS IS IS GOES BACK TO THE

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:46.805
FORMATION OF DOMAIN NAMES AND

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.339
HOW THAT IS PUT TOGETHER.

02:20:48.406 --> 02:20:49.407
TRADE.

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:50.542
IN DOMAIN NAMES ARE TWO VERY

02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:52.777
DIFFERENT THINGS AND WHEN TO MAY

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:54.312
NAMES WERE NEW TWENTY PEOPLE

02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:55.280
WERE STARTING TO GET TO MAY

02:20:55.346 --> 02:20:56.981
NAMES AND STARTED TO BE.

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:58.416
SUED BY OR OR GONE AFTER BY

02:20:58.483 --> 02:21:01.219
TRADEMARK OWNERS WHO WANTED TO

02:21:01.286 --> 02:21:02.253
TO CLAIM THAT DOMAIN NAME AS

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:03.421
THEIR TRADEMARK WHEN THEY WERE

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:04.622
PLENTY OF APPROPRIATE USES OF

02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:05.523
THOSE DOMAIN NAMES.

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:07.492
SO WHAT I DID NOT WANT TO DO

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:11.296
HERE IS TO TO FACILITATE.

02:21:11.362 --> 02:21:12.564
THE TRAY TRADEMARK OWNER IN

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.332
THESE CASES BEING ABLE TO GO

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:16.134
AFTER SOMEONE WHO HAS A DOMAIN

02:21:16.201 --> 02:21:17.202
NAME.

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:19.270
LEGITIMATELY. FOR THEIR OWN

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:20.939
PURPOSE OR FOR A PARITY PURPOSE

02:21:21.005 --> 02:21:23.074
OR ANY OTHER FIRST AMENDMENT

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.275
PURPOSE.

02:21:24.342 --> 02:21:25.877
AND HAVE SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:27.478
THEY ARE A TRADEMARK THEN GO

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:29.280
AFTER AND SHUT DOWN IN CHANGE A

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:29.614
DOMAIN NAME.

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:32.116
SO THAT CREATES A LITTLE BIT OF

02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:33.885
CONFUSION I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:35.186
THE THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:37.121
WANT TO VERY TIGHTLY CONTROL

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:38.590
THEIR TRADEMARK.

02:21:38.656 --> 02:21:41.259
BY CONTROLLING DOMAIN NAMES AND

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:42.460
THOSE AGAIN ARE TWO VERY

02:21:42.527 --> 02:21:44.529
DIFFERENT THINGS SO IF THERE IS

02:21:44.596 --> 02:21:46.364
A SPORTS STAR OR ENTERTAINMENT

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:48.066
STORE SOMEBODY ELSE.

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:50.702
WHO AND SOMEONE HAD IT HAS SOME

02:21:50.768 --> 02:21:52.570
CRITICISM OF THEM AND CREATES A

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:54.339
PARITY ACCOUNTS?

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:56.040
LEGITIMATELY THAT IS SOMETHING

02:21:56.107 --> 02:21:57.876
THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE

02:21:57.942 --> 02:22:00.245
SHUT DOWN UNDER THE RULES THAT

02:22:00.311 --> 02:22:01.713
ARE BEING CREATED HERE.

02:22:01.779 --> 02:22:03.414
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WE

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:05.049
ARE TRYING TO FACILITATE THE

02:22:05.116 --> 02:22:06.918
FRAUDULENT.

02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:09.387
SELLING OF TICKETS AND OTHER

02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:12.690
ASPECTS WHERE WE AGREE WE DO NOT

02:22:12.757 --> 02:22:14.225
WANT THAT BEHAVIOR BUT WHAT I

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:16.461
ALSO DON'T WANT TO DO IS MAKE IS

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:19.998
GIVE TOOLS. TO TRADEMARK OWNERS

02:22:20.064 --> 02:22:20.999
ADDITIONAL TOOLS A TRADEMARK

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:23.268
OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER TO

02:22:23.334 --> 02:22:25.270
THEM INCONVENIENT DOMAINS AND

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:27.205
DOMAIN NAMES.

02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:29.207
IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT.

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:31.542
COMBATING FRAUD NOT COMBATING

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:33.511
INAPPROPRIATE USES BUT ARE

02:22:33.578 --> 02:22:35.313
LEGITIMATE USES SO THAT'S THE

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.348
SENSITIVITY WERE REALLY TRYING

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:38.683
TO SOLVE HERE.

02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:40.051
IT IS STILL GO AFTER THE

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:41.786
FRAUDULENT USES OF NAMES THE

02:22:41.853 --> 02:22:45.623
MISDIRECTION OF A FAN WHO WANTS

02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:46.524
TO GO TO A CONCERT WAS BECAUSE

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.626
THAT WE WANT THEM TO GO TO THE

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:49.594
CORRECT SITES.

02:22:49.661 --> 02:22:51.462
BY SOMEONE WHO PUTS UP

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:54.866
LEGITIMATELY USES IT A DOMAIN

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:56.701
NAME CREATES A WEBSITE.

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:59.437
THAT HAS NO CONNECTION TO WHAT'S

02:22:59.504 --> 02:23:00.605
HAPPENING HERE.

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:02.507
THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE BEING

02:23:02.573 --> 02:23:05.076
PROSECUTED UNDER THIS AND THAT

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:06.444
WAS MY CONCERN THAT THIS WAS

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:08.413
BROADLY ENOUGH WRITTEN.

02:23:08.479 --> 02:23:10.348
THAT NOW A TRADEMARK OWNER IS

02:23:10.415 --> 02:23:13.551
GOING TO GO AFTER A DOMAIN NAME

02:23:13.618 --> 02:23:14.919
EIGHT A DOMAIN.

02:23:14.986 --> 02:23:16.521
THAT IS OUT ON THE INTERNET

02:23:16.587 --> 02:23:20.191
WHOSE PURPOSE IS UNRELATED TO

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:20.658
THE FRAUD THAT'S BEING

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.961
PERPETRATED.

02:23:23.027 --> 02:23:23.728
IF I COULD JUST ASK ONE FALL

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:24.362
QUESTIONS I THINK I UNDERSTAND

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.965
WHY YOU'D WANT.

02:23:27.031 --> 02:23:28.499
TO LIMIT THIS TO CERTAIN TYPES

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:29.801
OF MARKS I GUESS.

02:23:29.867 --> 02:23:31.703
THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF WITH

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:34.172
REGARDS TO BAD FAITH -- I'M

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:36.007
WONDERING HOW YOU BALANCE ADDED

02:23:36.074 --> 02:23:37.241
NOT BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED BUT

02:23:37.308 --> 02:23:38.142
AS I JUST READ IT IT SEEMS IF

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:39.978
YOU ARE IT IT WILL MAKE IT MORE

02:23:40.044 --> 02:23:41.179
DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THESE

02:23:41.245 --> 02:23:44.282
CASES.

02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:45.550
WONDER IF YOU THOUGHT OF THE GAP.

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:46.150
POTENTIALLY BUT AGAIN THE THE

02:23:46.217 --> 02:23:47.418
BALANCE BETWEEN PROSECUTING

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:49.020
THESE CASES OF FRAUD.

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:53.191
AND ABUSE OF A A TRADEMARK VIS A

02:23:53.257 --> 02:23:56.661
VIS A DOMAIN NAME IS WHAT.

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:58.663
TRYING TO TO THREAD SO IN CASES

02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:00.198
WHERE.

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:01.399
SOMEBODY'S USING A DOMAIN NAME

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:03.101
WITH THE INTENT TO DECEIVE A

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.969
CONSUMER AND GO GET THAT

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:06.804
CONSUMERS BUSINESS AS AND

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:08.973
REDIRECT THEM FROM.

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.242
A LEGITIMATE SITE IS SOMETHING I

02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:12.844
HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR AND THAT IS

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:13.411
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:24:13.478 --> 02:24:14.746
GOING AFTER.

02:24:14.812 --> 02:24:16.914
BUT TO THEN AND UNDER THE UNDER

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:18.082
THE BILL AS WRITTEN.

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:19.450
ORIGINALLY I WAS WORRIED THAT

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:21.185
THAT STARTS TO GIVE TOOLS TO

02:24:21.252 --> 02:24:22.553
SOMEONE WHO HAS A NAME WHO AS A

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.355
TRADEMARK WHO IS DOING BUSINESS

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:25.590
UNDER A NAME AND GIVE THEM THE

02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:26.691
ABILITY TO GO AFTER.

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:28.292
A SITE THAT IS INCONVENIENT TO

02:24:28.359 --> 02:24:31.129
THEM AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO

02:24:31.195 --> 02:24:34.699
IS PERPETRATING A FRAUD.

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.167
IT CASH OUT ON THAT IT THIS

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:37.802
INJECTION ASIAN BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:39.904
YOUR AMENDMENTS AND IS RESULT OF

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:41.739
YOUR EXPERIENCE IN YOUR PRIOR

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.274
LAW IT LIFE IS A LAWYER.

02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:45.309
AREN'T YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:45.843
THE PRACTICAL HERE RIGHT.

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:46.511
AND WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BUSINESS

02:24:46.577 --> 02:24:47.645
IN THE LAW WHERE EVERYBODY LOOKS

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:48.312
AT THESE THINGS IN A CERTAIN WAY.

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:50.848
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S CLEARLY

02:24:50.915 --> 02:24:52.083
A RAT FINK WHO'S OUT THERE

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:54.419
TRYING TO GET BUSINESS USING

02:24:54.485 --> 02:24:56.888
SOMEBODY ELSE'S NAME SPORTS TEAM.

02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:58.923
SAY THE DODGERS FOR EXAMPLE

02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:01.392
RIGHT IN ORDER TO GET TICKETS

02:25:01.459 --> 02:25:04.362
BECAUSE THAT'S OKAY WITH ME

02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:05.797
OPPLER TEAM.

02:25:05.863 --> 02:25:11.502
AND SO.

02:25:11.569 --> 02:25:14.972
AND SO YOU KNOW [inaudible]

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:17.909
IT'S ALWAYS.

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:19.177
THAT'S A WIN LOSE THE BILL WITH

02:25:19.243 --> 02:25:21.345
ALL YOU GUYS NORTH BUT IN ANY

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:23.114
EVENT WHAT I'VE A LOYAL FAN I'LL

02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:24.982
GO DOWN TO THE DEATH.

02:25:25.049 --> 02:25:27.418
BUT IN ANY EVENT -- THE POINT IS

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:28.186
THE USE THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:28.853
ABOUT FRANK SITE WE KNOW THAT'S

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.588
THE CASE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:31.189
TO GIVE THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:31.756
ACTION.

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.124
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PEOPLE GO

THAT WAS ARTICULATED IN THE

02:25:38.029 --> 02:25:39.197
ANALYSIS.

02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:41.365
AND SOMEBODY GOES THERE WILL

02:25:41.432 --> 02:25:41.999
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:45.069
TO GET A JUDGE LOOK AT THAT THAT

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:45.870
ISN'T ABOUT TO FROM FRIDAY SO I

02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:47.038
DO THINK ACTUALLY THAT IS YOU DO

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:48.506
THIS I KNOW HOW THE OTHER SIDE

02:25:48.573 --> 02:25:49.073
CAN ARGUE BECAUSE EVERYBODY

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:49.674
WANTS.

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:50.975
BELTS AND SUSPENDERS IT SAYS MY

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:52.043
COMPANIES EXEMPTED OR THIS BILLS

THEY CAN READ THINGS THE WAY

02:25:54.245 --> 02:25:54.946
THEY WANT TO READ IT IS LAWYERS

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:56.047
BUT THE REALITY IN PRACTICAL

02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:57.081
APPLICATION WHAT YOU'VE DONE

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:57.915
EXACTLY I THINK.

02:25:57.982 --> 02:26:04.021
ADDRESSES THIS THIS TENSION THAT

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:06.324
YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:07.759
IF I COULD JUST SAID I VERY MUCH

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:09.427
APPRECIATE THE TENSION HERE --

02:26:09.494 --> 02:26:11.496
BECAUSE HE'S A MAN IT'S A

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:13.131
RELATIVELY NEW WERE TRYING TO

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:15.099
ABSORB THEM -- I HAVE GATHERED

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:16.901
THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE

02:26:16.968 --> 02:26:17.435
SPENT A LOT OF TIME REALLY

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:18.536
THINKING THIS THROUGH.

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:19.504
I WILL.

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:20.138
VOTE FOR TO MOVE THIS FOR TODAY

02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:20.872
BUT I WILL JUST SAY MY HOPE IS

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:22.507
THAT THE PARTIES CAN CONTINUE TO

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:23.474
WORK ON THIS -- AS IT GOES TO

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:24.075
THE NEXT STOP IN AND I WILL

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:25.376
CERTAINLY RESERVE MY RIGHT TO

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:26.511
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS -- AT THE

02:26:26.577 --> 02:26:28.713
NEXT STOP IN AND I HOPE WE GET

02:26:28.779 --> 02:26:29.881
TO A CLOSE RESOLUTION THANK YOU

02:26:29.947 --> 02:26:30.748
AND I DO HOPE WE PASSED THIS BUT

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:32.016
AND MY COMMITMENT TO THE SENATOR

02:26:32.083 --> 02:26:32.717
IS. TO TRY AND RESOLVE THIS

02:26:32.783 --> 02:26:34.852
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A

02:26:34.919 --> 02:26:36.954
POINT WHERE THE OPPOSITION.

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:37.522
COMES OFTEN UNDERSTANDS IS

02:26:37.588 --> 02:26:38.656
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:39.457
IS GOING AFTER.

02:26:39.524 --> 02:26:40.291
FRAUDULENT USES THAT ARE

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:43.461
UNDERMINING A SPORTS SIDE OF

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:44.495
CELEBRITY SIDE.

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:46.330
ENTERTAINMENT SITES ABILITY TO

02:26:46.397 --> 02:26:47.899
DO THEIR BUSINESS ACTUALLY THAT

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:48.499
IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:50.835
INTERRUPT HERE BUT AS I READ

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:53.137
THIS AND HAVING BEEN INVOLVED

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:54.805
EARLY ON WITH SO MANY NAMES AND

02:26:54.872 --> 02:26:55.373
VARIOUS.

02:26:55.439 --> 02:26:57.975
ACTIONS AROUND TRADEMARK OWNERS

02:26:58.042 --> 02:27:00.211
TRYING TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:01.712
HAS LEGITIMATELY REGISTER DOMAIN

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:04.148
NAMES I AM SENSITIVE TO THIS

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:05.716
BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF THERE

02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:06.584
WERE A LOT OF ABUSES AT THAT

02:27:06.651 --> 02:27:07.318
TIME.

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:08.819
AND IN FACT INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:12.723
FORCED TO GIVE UP DOMAIN NAMES

02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.058
THAT THEY LEGITIMATE HAVE.

02:27:14.125 --> 02:27:14.725
UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE COURTS

02:27:14.792 --> 02:27:16.694
THAT LAW HAD SINCE BEEN CHANGED.

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:18.396
IN WAYS THAT GIVE SOME

02:27:18.462 --> 02:27:20.298
PREFERENCES TO SOMEONE WHO HAS

02:27:20.364 --> 02:27:23.367
LEGITIMATELY REGISTERED TO A

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:24.535
DOMAIN NAME.

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:25.803
THAT THAT WAS BENEFICIAL.

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:26.671
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A

02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:28.539
SITUATION NOW WHERE A TRADEMARK

02:27:28.606 --> 02:27:30.308
OWNER CAN UNNECESSARILY

02:27:30.374 --> 02:27:33.010
INTERFERE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS

02:27:33.077 --> 02:27:34.512
LEGITIMATE PUTTING OUT A DEMAND

02:27:34.579 --> 02:27:34.679
IT.

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:36.480
AND SO IF IF.

02:27:36.547 --> 02:27:39.350
YOU WANT TO PUT UP A A DOMAIN

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:43.254
THAT SAYS DODGERS STOCK.

02:27:43.321 --> 02:27:47.425
AS A GUIDE FOR AS A SORRY WERE

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:50.294
WERE.

02:27:50.361 --> 02:27:52.430
I THEY OWN THAT ACTUALLY SAID IF

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:53.030
THIS SENATOR BROUGHT THAT UP

02:27:53.097 --> 02:27:53.564
RIGHT THAT SHOULD NOT BE

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:58.469
SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICIAL.

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:02.740
THE THAT DE THE OFFICIAL.

02:28:02.807 --> 02:28:03.808
TEAM SHOULD BE GOING AFTER

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:04.508
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ABOUT.

02:28:04.575 --> 02:28:05.509
COLLECTING AND DIVERTING SOMEONE

02:28:05.576 --> 02:28:06.444
AWAY FROM TICKETS IT'S ABOUT A

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:07.745
VALUE STATEMENT THAT SOMEBODY

02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:08.779
WOULD WANT TODAY.

02:28:08.846 --> 02:28:09.914
SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.382
THAT IS WHERE THE FIRST A MEMBER

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:12.250
COMES AND WE DON'T WANT TO

02:28:12.316 --> 02:28:12.950
PREVENT THAT [inaudible]

02:28:13.017 --> 02:28:14.952
THAT'S A POLITICAL STATEMENT A

02:28:15.019 --> 02:28:16.053
RIVAL RESTATEMENT BUT NOT

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.154
NECESSARILY INTERVIEW.

02:28:17.221 --> 02:28:19.023
INTERFERING WITH THE DODGERS

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:20.725
ABILITY TO STIR SELL TICKETS OR

02:28:20.791 --> 02:28:21.993
THEIR AUTHORIZED AGENTS.

02:28:22.059 --> 02:28:24.128
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:26.163
DO AND IF WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS.

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:27.665
PERFECTLY WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE

02:28:27.732 --> 02:28:28.666
TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:30.568
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO THREAD

02:28:30.635 --> 02:28:32.536
AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE STOPPING

02:28:32.603 --> 02:28:34.972
THE OFFENSES INTENDED.

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:38.409
BUT NOT GOING ON BEYOND WHERE

02:28:38.476 --> 02:28:40.177
WE'RE GONNA NOW SEE THE THAT

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:42.013
THIS LAW BE ABLE TO BE USED TO

02:28:42.079 --> 02:28:43.581
SHUT DOWN DEMANDS THAT HAVE

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:44.448
REALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:45.483
FRAUD.

02:28:45.549 --> 02:28:47.485
THAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND I

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:48.286
AND I SEE WHY THIS IS SO

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:49.887
DIFFICULT TO THREAD BECAUSE THE

02:28:49.954 --> 02:28:51.656
OPPOSITE CASE IF IF SOMEONE.

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:53.457
PERHAPS THE SENATE AUTHOR -- HAD

02:28:53.524 --> 02:28:54.525
PURCHASED GO DODGERS AND THAT

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:57.028
BECAME A WAY TO SELL TICKETS

02:28:57.094 --> 02:28:58.896
FRAUDULENTLY CORRECT THOSE ARE

02:28:58.963 --> 02:29:00.364
THE TWO SCENARIOS THAT WERE

02:29:00.431 --> 02:29:01.599
TRYING TO DISTINGUISH.

02:29:01.666 --> 02:29:03.601
YES YES AND SO IF THAT GO

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:05.102
DODGERS EURO IS BEING USED

02:29:05.169 --> 02:29:07.004
FRAUDULENTLY WE WE WANT TO BE

02:29:07.071 --> 02:29:08.172
ABLE TO GO AND STOP THAT.

02:29:08.239 --> 02:29:12.243
BUT IF THAT'S BEING USED IN A

02:29:12.310 --> 02:29:16.180
WAY THAT IS.

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:18.282
AS I SAY AND RELY AMPLE IN.

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:19.784
YEAH EXAMPLE LIKE TO GO IN ALL

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:22.153
THE GIANTS GAMES AND BASICALLY.

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:26.757
PROTESTERS THE TEAM.

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:32.363
NOW YOU LAWSUIT I'D WHAT WOULD

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:33.097
BE THE JANITOR PURPOSE

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:33.397
[inaudible]

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:36.334
YEAH.

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:39.970
BUT NOT SELL TICKETS AT YOU KNOW

THAT AMOUNTS THAT'S A

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:44.408
DISTINCTION WE'RE TRYING TO

THE STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST AN

02:52:24.133 --> 02:52:26.302
UNJUST DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:27.270
THAT FORCED THEM TO BE

02:52:27.336 --> 02:52:28.504
VULNERABLE.

02:52:28.571 --> 02:52:30.206

LAW AND POVERTY AND I HAVE TO

02:52:55.665 --> 02:52:57.400
SAY AT THE OUTSET THERE'S NO WAY

02:52:57.467 --> 02:52:58.434
I'M GOING TO TOP THAT.

02:52:58.501 --> 02:53:01.437
AND I JUST SAW WHAT I WANT TO

02:53:01.504 --> 02:53:04.040
SAY THOUGH -- YOU KNOW AS MANY

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:04.774
OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:06.843
OUR OUR BRAD AND BUTTER ISSUES

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:08.678
UP HERE ARE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND

02:53:08.745 --> 02:53:10.346
WE WORK ON THEM ALL THE TIME.

02:53:10.413 --> 02:53:11.614
AND THOSE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE

02:53:11.681 --> 02:53:13.149
THERE FOR GOOD REASON THAT WHEN

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:16.285
SOMEONE HAS TROUBLE.

02:53:16.352 --> 02:53:17.787
LOSE THEIR JOB THEY THEY LACK

02:53:17.854 --> 02:53:20.490
EMPLOYMENT -- THOSE ARE THERE TO

02:53:20.556 --> 02:53:21.524
BE A SAFETY NET FOR OUR

02:53:21.591 --> 02:53:23.159
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND AND

02:53:23.226 --> 02:53:23.960
THERE AND WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM

02:53:24.026 --> 02:53:25.661
IN THERE AND IT WORKS REASONABLY

02:53:25.728 --> 02:53:26.395
EFFECTIVELY.

02:53:26.462 --> 02:53:29.532
BUT TOO OFTEN WHAT WE SEE IS

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.000
THAT PEOPLE END UP HAVING TO USE

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:32.702
THOSE PUBLIC BENEFITS SYSTEMS

02:53:32.769 --> 02:53:34.036
BECAUSE OF SITUATIONS LIKE YOU

02:53:34.103 --> 02:53:34.704
JUST HEARD.

02:53:34.771 --> 02:53:36.205
PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED

02:53:36.272 --> 02:53:37.607
UNFAIRLY AND WORK THEY'RE BEING

02:53:37.673 --> 02:53:39.709
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND

02:53:39.776 --> 02:53:41.244
BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE BEING

02:53:41.310 --> 02:53:42.044
FORCED THEM TO OUR PUBLIC

02:53:42.111 --> 02:53:43.112
BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

02:53:43.179 --> 02:53:44.914
WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:46.015
PEOPLE?

02:53:46.082 --> 02:53:49.085
THERE SHOULD BE A LEGAL RECOURSE --

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.820
UNFORTUNATELY OUR STATE SYSTEM

02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:52.922
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL THE LAST

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:54.757
DECADE OR SO HAS.

02:53:54.824 --> 02:53:56.859
NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THE JOB

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:57.960
THAT IT THAT IT NEEDS TO BE

02:53:58.027 --> 02:54:00.062
DOING TO PROTECT WORKERS LIKE MS

02:54:00.129 --> 02:54:02.565
JONES WHEN WITH THE LACK OF

02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:03.866
THOSE RESOURCES AND AND THE

02:54:03.933 --> 02:54:05.668
FAILURE OF MANY INVESTIGATIONS

02:54:05.735 --> 02:54:07.003
BY DE OF THE H..

02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:07.770
WE ARE SEEING WORKERS FALL

02:54:07.837 --> 02:54:08.704
THROUGH THE CRACK AND THEN

02:54:08.771 --> 02:54:10.640
HAVING TO RELY ON PUBLIC

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:16.412
ASSISTANCE ALL THE TIME -- I

02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:17.213
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT REALLY WHAT

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:17.880
THIS IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS THE

02:54:17.947 --> 02:54:18.748
SAME BALLOTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:19.582
FAIR HOUSING FOR MANY YEARS.

02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:21.851
MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE

02:54:21.918 --> 02:54:23.553
LOCAL FAIR HOUSING COMMISSIONS

02:54:23.619 --> 02:54:25.655
THAT BACK UP AND WORK WITH THE

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:28.191
STATE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT MORE

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.659
PEOPLE GET THE KIND OF

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:30.693
PROTECTIONS THEY NEED WHEN

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:32.061
THEY'RE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

02:54:32.128 --> 02:54:33.963
IN THE HOUSING WORLD AND WE'RE

02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:35.531
NOW SUGGESTING THAT THAT OUGHT

02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:36.966
TO BE EXTENDED OUT TO EMPLOYMENT

02:54:37.033 --> 02:54:39.468
CASES AND FOR THAT REASON WE

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:40.536
BELIEVE THAT.

02:54:40.603 --> 02:54:42.972
SB TWO EIGHTEEN IS REALLY JUST

02:54:43.039 --> 02:54:44.674
KIND OF A MODICUM OF BASIC

02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:46.676
DECENCY THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE AT

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:48.711
THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT

02:54:48.778 --> 02:54:50.079
THAT EMPLOYMENT GETS THE SAME

02:54:50.146 --> 02:54:51.514
PROTECTION THAT HOUSING DOES.

02:54:51.581 --> 02:54:53.149
AND WE ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:54:53.216 --> 02:54:54.750
TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THOSE

02:54:54.817 --> 02:54:56.786
KIND OF AGENCIES ALSO.

REGARDS TO THE SUBSTANTIVE

02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:49.932
INCONSISTENCY IN WHAT THIS BILL

THIS PROPOSAL AND ONE OF THOSE --

02:57:14.991 --> 02:57:16.525
IT ONE OF THE ISSUES IN THE

REPORT THAT IS RAISED IS THE

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:19.562
TRAINING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY

02:57:19.628 --> 02:57:20.730
TO BE CONDUCTED FOR A LOT OF

OWN DISCRIMINATION LAWS ON WHICH

02:57:40.449 --> 02:57:41.851
WOULD CREATE INCONSISTENCIES

02:57:41.917 --> 02:57:42.752
FROM JURISDICTION TO

02:57:42.818 --> 02:57:43.919

QUALIFIES FOR A DISCRIMINATION.

02:57:46.222 --> 02:57:47.623
AND COULD HAVE A CHALLENGES FOR

02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:49.225
AN EMPLOYER WHO OPERATES IN

02:57:49.291 --> 02:57:49.825
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT

02:57:49.892 --> 02:57:51.527
THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

02:57:51.594 --> 02:57:52.695

02:57:59.201 --> 02:57:59.869
CONCERNS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE

02:57:59.935 --> 02:58:00.436

02:58:11.213 --> 02:58:12.381
AGENCIES ARE WORK TOGETHER --

02:58:12.448 --> 02:58:14.216
AND THAT IT IS RESOLVED IN A WAY --

02:58:14.283 --> 02:58:15.117
THAT DOESN'T.

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:16.018
OBVIOUSLY AT THAT PROTECTS THE

02:58:16.085 --> 02:58:16.819
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PURSUING A

02:58:16.886 --> 02:58:17.787
DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT BUT

02:58:17.853 --> 02:58:19.055
ALSO PROVIDES NOTICE AN

02:58:19.121 --> 02:58:20.389
OPPORTUNITY.

02:58:20.456 --> 02:58:21.957
AND RIGHTS FOR THE EMPLOYER WHO

02:58:22.024 --> 02:58:24.026
IS IT WHO IS CHALLENGING -- THE

02:58:24.093 --> 02:58:25.528
CLAIM -- WHICH WE ALSO CAN ARE

02:58:25.594 --> 02:58:26.462
CONCERNED THAT THE BILL THAT'S

02:58:26.529 --> 02:58:27.763
IMPROPER WE HAVE THOSE PROCESSES

02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:29.565
IN PLACE AND OTHER CONCERNED IS

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:31.067
ALSO WITH REGARDS TO VENUE AND

02:58:31.133 --> 02:58:32.468
WHERE THESE CLAIMS REFILED

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:33.069
OBVIOUSLY.

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:34.603
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:36.105
WHERE DISCRIMINATION NECESSARILY

02:58:36.172 --> 02:58:39.041
OCCURS AND TO HAVE.

02:58:39.108 --> 02:58:41.077
SOME LOCATION.

02:58:41.143 --> 02:58:42.144
IT COULD CREATE A VENUE

02:58:42.211 --> 02:58:43.512
CHALLENGE WITH REGARDS TO VENUE

02:58:43.579 --> 02:58:44.980
SHOPPING INFORM SHOPPING WITH

02:58:45.047 --> 02:58:46.682
REGARDS TO WHERE THE CLAIMS ARE

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:48.184
BEING PROCESSED AND CLARA.

02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:49.618
AND AND FILED AND SO WE HAVE --

02:58:49.685 --> 02:58:50.753
CONCERNS FROM THAT PROCEDURAL

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:52.455
PROCESS AS WELL SO WE ARE

02:58:52.521 --> 02:58:54.790
CONCERNED -- AND MY FINAL POINT

02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:56.725
IS -- IF TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:58:56.792 --> 02:58:58.360
EXISTING AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT

02:58:58.427 --> 02:58:59.628
OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING

02:58:59.695 --> 02:59:01.163
IS NOT INVESTIGATING THESE IN A

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:02.998
AND FISHING MANNER -- WE HAVE A

02:59:03.065 --> 02:59:04.633
HUGE SURPLUS IN THE STATE RIGHT

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.902
NOW BUDGETARY A SURPLUS AND SO I

02:59:06.969 --> 02:59:08.704
HAVEN'T FOUND A REASON AS TO WHY

02:59:08.771 --> 02:59:09.872
WE CAN'T JUST DEVOTE MORE

02:59:09.939 --> 02:59:11.540
RESOURCES TO THE EXISTING AGENCY

02:59:11.607 --> 02:59:12.541
AND AVOID A LOT OF THESE

02:59:12.608 --> 02:59:13.576
PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE

02:59:13.642 --> 02:59:15.277
INCONSISTENCIES THAT WE'VE

02:59:15.344 --> 02:59:16.712
RAISED AS CONCERNS.

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:17.913
I'M AND HAVE THAT BEING A WAY TO

02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:19.515
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MORE

02:59:19.582 --> 02:59:21.150
EFFICIENT -- RESOLUTION OF

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:22.384
INVESTIGATIONS AND COMPLAINTS

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:24.153
FILED WITH THE DMV H. SO FOR

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:26.222
THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED.

02:59:26.288 --> 02:59:27.923
THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS KIM

02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:29.191
STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF

02:59:29.258 --> 02:59:30.893
OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION

02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:33.195
OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION --

02:59:33.262 --> 02:59:34.296
OF COURSE THAT ENFORCEMENT

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:36.599
AGGRESSIVE AN APPROPRIATE

02:59:36.665 --> 02:59:37.867
ENFORCEMENT UNFAIR AND POINTED

02:59:37.933 --> 02:59:39.935
IN HOUSING ACT IS IMPORTANT BUT

02:59:40.002 --> 02:59:40.836
BUSINESSES AND POTENTIAL

02:59:40.903 --> 02:59:42.738
DEFENDANTS DO NEED CONSISTENCY

02:59:42.805 --> 02:59:44.340
SO THEY'RE AWARE OF CLEAR RULES

02:59:44.406 --> 02:59:46.542
AND CAN FOLLOW THEM -- THIS BILL

02:59:46.609 --> 02:59:48.844
IF ENACTED COULD LEAD TO A

02:59:48.911 --> 02:59:50.279
SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:51.814
DIFFERENT RULES -- IN DIFFERENT

02:59:51.881 --> 02:59:53.616
JURISDICTIONS FOR EXAMPLE YOUR

02:59:53.682 --> 02:59:55.651
DISTRICT STAFF MIGHT HAVE ONE

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:57.119
SET OF DISCRIMINATION RULES

02:59:57.186 --> 02:59:58.420
WHEREAS YOUR CAPITAL STAFF MIGHT

02:59:58.487 --> 02:59:59.788
HAVE ANOTHER ONE WELL THAT WOULD

02:59:59.855 --> 03:00:01.790
BE DIFFICULT TO COMPLY WITH FOR

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:02.992
LEGISLATORS BUSINESSES WHO OF

03:00:03.058 --> 03:00:03.526
DIFFERENT.

03:00:03.592 --> 03:00:04.927
LOCATIONS WOULD HAVE THE SAME

03:00:04.994 --> 03:00:07.229
PROBLEM LOCAL ENFORCEMENT WOULD

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:09.298
POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A PATCH WORK --

03:00:09.365 --> 03:00:10.499
A VERY RULES MAKING IT HARDER

03:00:10.566 --> 03:00:11.967
FOR DEFENDANTS TO COMPLY WHICH

03:00:12.034 --> 03:00:13.802
WE WANT THEM TO DO FOR THOSE

03:00:13.869 --> 03:00:15.271
REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY

03:00:15.337 --> 03:00:20.609
OPPOSE THE BILL.

03:00:20.676 --> 03:00:21.110
THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

03:00:21.177 --> 03:00:22.978
OPPOSITION.

03:00:23.045 --> 03:00:23.946
RIGHT SIGNALED BRING BACK TO THE

03:00:24.013 --> 03:00:24.813
COMMITTEE.

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:28.717
QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

03:00:28.784 --> 03:00:33.222
THIS FEATURE NORTH.

03:00:33.289 --> 03:00:35.057
SENATOR I'M JUST PICKING UP I

03:00:35.124 --> 03:00:37.593
THINK ON A QUESTION THAT THE

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:38.961
OPPOSITION RAISED I AM.

03:00:39.028 --> 03:00:39.828
SO.

03:00:39.895 --> 03:00:41.530
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THE PRIMARY

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:42.798
MOTIVATION FOR FOR THIS PIECE OF

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:43.732
LEGISLATION IS THAT T. F. EACH

03:00:43.799 --> 03:00:45.734
DOES NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE

03:00:45.801 --> 03:00:48.404
CAPACITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS.

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.306
YOU'RE IN A EXPEDITIOUS MANNER

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:53.642
SO WHY WOULD WE CREATE AN OF A

03:00:53.709 --> 03:00:54.944
PARALLEL PROCESS RATHER THAN

03:00:55.010 --> 03:00:57.446
JUST INVESTING MORE RESOURCES

03:00:57.513 --> 03:01:00.182
INDIA V. H. R. IN ORDER TO SERVE

03:01:00.249 --> 03:01:04.587
OUR EMPLOYEES BETTER I AND TO BE

03:01:04.653 --> 03:01:05.688
ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT WERE IT

03:01:05.754 --> 03:01:06.422
OCCURRED.

03:01:06.488 --> 03:01:08.991
PROVIDES A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

03:01:09.058 --> 03:01:11.360
I FEEL RESOLUTION AND THE

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:13.229
INVESTIGATION VERSUS GIVEN IT TO

03:01:13.295 --> 03:01:15.231
THE STATE THAT'S CUMBERSOME WE

03:01:15.297 --> 03:01:16.899
ALL YEAR EVERY IN EVERY

03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:17.666
DEPARTMENT OF OCT.

03:01:17.733 --> 03:01:20.436
HOW THE STATE IS OVER BURDEN HOW

03:01:20.502 --> 03:01:21.670
WE'RE SLOW HOW WE'RE SPENDING

03:01:21.737 --> 03:01:22.638
TOO MUCH MONEY NOW WE WANT TO

03:01:22.705 --> 03:01:24.173
DIRECT MORE MONEY TO A

03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:25.708
DEPARTMENT THAT IS NOT?

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:27.076
DOING THE JOB IT DIDN'T HAVE THE

03:01:27.142 --> 03:01:28.544
CAPACITY LET THE LOCAL LEVEL DO

03:01:28.611 --> 03:01:30.212
IT WORK THE DISCRIMINATION

03:01:30.279 --> 03:01:32.114
HAPPENED WORTH THE VIOLATION

03:01:32.181 --> 03:01:33.048
HAPPEN I THINK.

03:01:33.115 --> 03:01:35.050
IT'S NOT CREATING ANY NEW LAWS

03:01:35.117 --> 03:01:36.318
IT'S FOLLOWING WHAT'S ON THE

03:01:36.385 --> 03:01:38.621
BOOKS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE

03:01:38.687 --> 03:01:39.922
AND JUST LIGHTEN LOCAL

03:01:39.989 --> 03:01:41.824
GOVERNMENT INTERPRET THOSE SAME

03:01:41.890 --> 03:01:44.293
LAWS THE SAME WAY ARBITRATOR FOR

03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:44.793
THE STATE WOULD DO IT.

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:46.495
SO THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING THE

03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:49.999
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE THE

03:01:50.065 --> 03:01:52.368
ARBITRATOR VERSUS THE STATE.

03:01:52.434 --> 03:01:54.436
SEC IT'S GIVING MORE LOCAL

03:01:54.503 --> 03:01:55.137
CONTROL.

03:01:55.204 --> 03:01:56.405
BUT NOT CREATING A NEW PROCESS

03:01:56.472 --> 03:01:57.906
THE PROCESS IS WHAT'S ON THE

03:01:57.973 --> 03:01:58.307
BOOKS UNDER FIAT.

03:01:58.374 --> 03:01:59.742
AND FOLLOWING THOSE RULES AND

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.210
GUIDELINES FOR DISCRIMINATION

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:03.045
THAT HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE

03:02:03.112 --> 03:02:03.579
NINETEEN FIFTY NINE NOT.

03:02:03.646 --> 03:02:05.948
CREATING A NEW SET OF GUIDELINES

03:02:06.015 --> 03:02:07.616
TO SAY THIS IS DISCRIMINATION

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:09.184
THIS IS NOT IT'S CLEARLY DEFINE

03:02:09.251 --> 03:02:10.486
WHAT WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AS

03:02:10.552 --> 03:02:12.655
WE'RE JUST ASKING THE LOCAL

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:15.057
GOVERNMENT TO INTERPRET THAT.

03:02:15.124 --> 03:02:18.027
AND SO DO YOU HAVE A DO YOU

03:02:18.093 --> 03:02:19.295
SHARE ANY OF THE CONCERNS OF THE

03:02:19.361 --> 03:02:21.163
OPPOSITION RAISED IN TERMS OF

03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:22.364
THE RISK THAT THERE'S GOING TO

03:02:22.431 --> 03:02:23.766
BE INCONSISTENT AND

03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:25.334
INTERPRETATION AND AT WHAT CAN

03:02:25.401 --> 03:02:27.903
WE DO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS.

03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:29.805
CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION AND

03:02:29.872 --> 03:02:30.739
CONSISTENT I GUESS WE CAN EITHER

03:02:30.806 --> 03:02:33.042
CONCERN ON ALMOST ANYTHING AND

03:02:33.108 --> 03:02:34.376
WHEN YOU HAVE LOCAL

03:02:34.443 --> 03:02:36.011
MUNICIPALITIES ARE COUNTY

03:02:36.078 --> 03:02:38.480
GOVERNMENT TO INTERPRET THINGS

03:02:38.547 --> 03:02:39.748
DIFFERENTLY.

03:02:39.815 --> 03:02:41.717
BASED ON THE MIND SET OR THE

03:02:41.784 --> 03:02:43.419
POPULATION THAT THE SERVER BUT

03:02:43.485 --> 03:02:44.853
I'M NOT FEARFUL THAT IF THE

03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:46.355
GUIDELINES ARE THERE WHETHER

03:02:46.422 --> 03:02:48.791
IT'S A FEDERAL LAW STATE LAW OR

03:02:48.857 --> 03:02:50.426
A LOCAL ORDINANCE I THINK I HAVE

03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:51.927
ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:53.429
INTERPRET IT APPROPRIATELY.

03:02:53.495 --> 03:02:54.963
AND APPLY IT IN A JUST AND FAIR

03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:56.899
MANNER AND SHOW WHETHER IT'S

03:02:56.965 --> 03:02:58.233
BEING DONE ON A LOCAL LEVEL OR

03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.336
STAY LOW WHY I'M CONFIDENT THAT.

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:01.370
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF

03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.005
THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE IT OFF AGAIN

03:03:03.072 --> 03:03:04.173
IT DOESN'T PREVENT.

03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:05.908
AN EMPLOYEE.

03:03:05.974 --> 03:03:07.443
FROM FILING THIS WITH THE STATE

03:03:07.509 --> 03:03:09.278
AND IF YOU DO SO THE LOCAL

03:03:09.345 --> 03:03:11.547
GOVERNMENT HAD -- NOEL INTO

03:03:11.613 --> 03:03:13.015
INTERVENTION IN IT AT ALL STATE

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:14.183
CAN STILL DO IT BUT IT GIVES US

03:03:14.249 --> 03:03:16.018
THAT EMPLOYEE WHO'S BEEN

03:03:16.085 --> 03:03:19.521
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

03:03:19.588 --> 03:03:20.189
ANOTHER OPTION.

03:03:20.255 --> 03:03:21.957
AT THANK YOU.

03:03:22.024 --> 03:03:23.025
THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS

03:03:23.092 --> 03:03:25.828
COMMENTS.

THIS MAIENSCHEIN.

03:03:26.562 --> 03:03:28.364
JUST BRIEFLY KIND OF PICKING UP

03:03:28.430 --> 03:03:28.997
THERE FOR A SECOND.

03:03:29.064 --> 03:03:31.433
SO AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I

03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:32.601
UNDERSTAND THAT A LITTLE BIT

03:03:32.668 --> 03:03:34.436
WHAT AND MAYBE A DEMERIT DUMP

03:03:34.503 --> 03:03:36.271
BUT CURRENTLY THE STATE THE

03:03:36.338 --> 03:03:37.306
STATE HAS A PROCESS THEY GO

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:39.375
THROUGH.

03:03:39.441 --> 03:03:41.210
ON HEARING THESE SUIT.

03:03:41.276 --> 03:03:42.244

03:03:42.311 --> 03:03:43.112
TAKE IT THE THE INITIAL

03:03:43.178 --> 03:03:45.013
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND THEN

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:46.615
AND THEN THE APPEALS PROCESS. TO

03:03:46.682 --> 03:03:47.750
THE STATE HAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

03:03:47.816 --> 03:03:50.285
PROCESS THAT MAY FOLLOW ON THESE

03:03:50.352 --> 03:03:52.154
CLAIMS [inaudible]

03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:53.722
YES.

03:03:53.789 --> 03:03:56.091
THIS YOU KNOW SAN DIEGO OR LA OR

03:03:56.158 --> 03:03:57.393
SAN FRANCISCO TAKING KIND OF THE

03:03:57.459 --> 03:03:59.328
BARE PARTS BUT EVEN.

03:03:59.395 --> 03:04:01.296
MAYBE IN A MORE PROBLEMATIC WAY

03:04:01.363 --> 03:04:02.731
MAYBE SOME OF THE SMALLER.

03:04:02.798 --> 03:04:05.401
COUNTIES IN THE STATE.

03:04:05.467 --> 03:04:06.435
COULD DO THAT DIFFERENTLY IS

03:04:06.502 --> 03:04:08.570
THAT.

03:04:08.637 --> 03:04:12.608
A FAIR STATEMENT.

03:04:12.674 --> 03:04:14.943
I AM I MEAN YES I THINK THAT'S

03:04:15.010 --> 03:04:16.779
FAIR TO SAY THAT SOMEONE MIGHT

03:04:16.845 --> 03:04:18.080
INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY JUST

03:04:18.147 --> 03:04:21.216

03:22:32.673 --> 03:22:33.708
ONE PARTICULAR PRODUCT THAT

03:22:33.774 --> 03:22:35.009

ADVANTAGE OF RESPECTIVELY

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:42.250
APPLIANCE I THINK IF IT'S WITHIN

03:22:42.316 --> 03:22:43.284
PEOPLE'S BUDGETS AND AN EFFECT.

03:22:43.351 --> 03:22:44.652
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN ACTUALLY

03:22:44.719 --> 03:22:46.053
FIT WITHIN THEIR BUDGET THEY ARE

03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:47.221
PRESENTED WITH A PRODUCT IN

03:22:47.288 --> 03:22:47.955
WHICH THEY HAVE TO PAY NO

03:22:48.022 --> 03:22:48.823
INTEREST.

03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:51.959
AND SO IT'S IT'S A VERY --

03:22:52.026 --> 03:22:52.994
APPEALING PRODUCT WHEN LIKE HECK

03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:54.195
IF I IF I COULD PAY THIS BACK IN

03:22:54.262 --> 03:22:55.229
TWELVE MONTHS OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS

I PAY NO INTEREST.

03:22:56.197 --> 03:22:57.265
THE COULD DIVIDE WHATEVER THE

03:22:57.331 --> 03:22:59.367
BALANCES OVER THAT PERIOD OF

03:22:59.433 --> 03:23:01.202
TIME AND PAY IT ALL BACK.

03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:03.371

TO POLICE.

03:23:17.451 --> 03:23:18.019
AM I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS

03:23:18.085 --> 03:23:18.653
REALLY WHAT'S BEING OFFERED IS

03:23:18.719 --> 03:23:19.554
ONE OPTION -- AND SO I WOULD SAY

03:23:19.620 --> 03:23:20.154
YOU KNOW IF THE OPPONENTS ARE

03:23:20.221 --> 03:23:20.821
INTERESTED IN OFFERING MORE THAN

03:23:20.888 --> 03:23:21.489
ONE OPTION AND EXPLAINING THINGS

03:23:21.556 --> 03:23:22.089
CLEARLY IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE

03:23:22.156 --> 03:23:22.757
UNDERSTAND THEM THEN WE WOULDN'T

03:23:22.823 --> 03:23:23.324
NECESSARILY BE HERE TODAY.

03:23:23.391 --> 03:23:23.958
BUT WITH DEFERRED INTEREST WHAT

03:23:24.025 --> 03:23:24.659
THE ISSUE IS SO FOR A MIDDLE OR

03:23:24.725 --> 03:23:25.660
UPPER CLASS INCOME PERSON WHO

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:27.061
COULD REASONABLY PAY IT OFF

03:23:27.128 --> 03:23:28.162
WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS.

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:29.697
IT IS A GREAT DEAL IT'S 0%

03:23:29.764 --> 03:23:31.732
INTEREST BUT IF YOU KNOW AT THE

03:23:31.799 --> 03:23:33.167
OUTSET THE PERSON'S NOT GONNA BE

03:23:33.234 --> 03:23:34.335
ABLE TO PAY THAT OFF.

03:23:34.402 --> 03:23:35.903
IT'S A WORSE DEAL BECAUSE YOU

03:23:35.970 --> 03:23:37.838
ARE PAYING AND THESE ARE RANGE

03:23:37.905 --> 03:23:39.574
BETWEEN TWENTY SIX AND 28%

03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:42.243
INTEREST FOR THE ENTIRE TIME AND

03:23:42.310 --> 03:23:43.644
THAT YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GO OVER

03:23:43.711 --> 03:23:44.545
THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD YOU'VE

03:23:44.612 --> 03:23:46.347
BEEN GARNERING THAT INTEREST THE

03:23:46.414 --> 03:23:48.883
ENTIRE TIME -- SO FOR PEOPLE WHO

03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:50.451
CONCEIVABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

03:23:50.518 --> 03:23:52.553
PAY IT OFF NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT

03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:54.956
TOLD CLEARLY HOW THE INTEREST IS

03:23:55.022 --> 03:23:57.091
WORKING -- THERE ALSO IN A MUCH

03:23:57.158 --> 03:23:59.527
WORSE POSITION THAN IF THEY HAD

03:23:59.594 --> 03:24:02.797
TAKEN A LOWER FIXED RATE CARD.

03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:03.898
AND I THINK I WOULD BE SAD -- I

03:24:03.965 --> 03:24:04.532
DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF YOU BUT

03:24:04.599 --> 03:24:05.733
WHEN I GO TO THE DENTIST -- I'VE

03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:06.667
NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE WITH MY

03:24:06.734 --> 03:24:08.369
DENTIST OR ANYONE IN THIS OFFICE

03:24:08.436 --> 03:24:09.804
WHO IGNORE SHOULD I THINK WE

03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:11.172
SHOULD EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE

03:24:11.238 --> 03:24:13.074
SKILLED.

03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:14.675
AT WALKING THROUGH.

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:16.177
ALL OF THE ELEMENTS AS WAS

03:24:16.243 --> 03:24:18.846
SUGGESTED IN ME APPLY FOR CREDIT

03:24:18.913 --> 03:24:21.749
AND YOU KNOW.

03:24:21.816 --> 03:24:24.251
WHILE WHEN THE DO FLOSS DAILY

03:24:24.318 --> 03:24:25.553
AND GO TWICE A YEAR OUR DENTAL

03:24:25.620 --> 03:24:27.288
EXPERIENCES CAN BE POSITIVE ONES

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:29.290
AND WHEN THEY AREN'T THAT'S THE

03:24:29.357 --> 03:24:31.659
LEAST APPROPRIATE TIME TO BE IN

03:24:31.726 --> 03:24:33.227
THE CHAIR IN PAIN.

03:24:33.294 --> 03:24:34.495
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE AND FIGURE

03:24:34.562 --> 03:24:36.697
THIS OUT AND SO PART OF WHAT

03:24:36.764 --> 03:24:37.732
WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO IN EARLIER

03:24:37.798 --> 03:24:39.033

03:24:42.737 --> 03:24:44.605
PLACE DON'T TALK TO ME WHEN I'M

03:24:49.210 --> 03:24:49.777
PAIN.

ENCUMBER ME FINANCIALLY IN THE

03:24:58.586 --> 03:24:59.553
FUTURE AND SO IT REALLY IS

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:00.955
TRYING TO CREATE THIS BALANCE WE

03:25:01.022 --> 03:25:02.623
WANT THE PRODUCT TO BE AVAILABLE

03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:05.960
FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD. TEN

TWELVE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:25:06.627 --> 03:25:09.296
DENTAL BILLS BUT I ALSO DON'T

03:25:09.363 --> 03:25:09.930

WE WANT TO TRY AND MAKE SURE AT

03:25:24.145 --> 03:25:25.546
THE END WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT

03:25:25.613 --> 03:25:26.747
THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

03:25:26.814 --> 03:25:28.049
PRODUCTS AVAILABLE.

03:25:28.115 --> 03:25:29.950
BUT LOOKING AT THE VALUE OF OUR

03:25:30.017 --> 03:25:31.218
CLOTHING AROUND HERE I DON'T

03:25:31.285 --> 03:25:32.453
KNOW THAT WE ALL REALLY

03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:33.888
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION OF

03:25:33.954 --> 03:25:35.823
BEING.

03:25:35.890 --> 03:25:37.358
IN A POSITION OF NOT NECESSARILY

03:25:37.425 --> 03:25:38.926
BEING OF THE PAY SOMETHING OFF

03:25:38.993 --> 03:25:40.761
WITHIN CERTAIN TIME LINES AND

03:25:40.828 --> 03:25:41.862
THE THOUGHT OF BEING OFFERED A

03:25:41.929 --> 03:25:43.030
FINANCIAL PRODUCT.

03:25:43.097 --> 03:25:44.165
WHEN YOU'RE IN AN OFFICE

03:25:44.231 --> 03:25:45.332
SURROUNDED BY VERY SHARP THINGS

03:25:45.399 --> 03:25:49.303
THAT MAY END UP IN YOUR MOUTH?

03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:50.404
IS CHEST ASTONISHING.

03:25:50.471 --> 03:25:51.872
BUT ALSO.

03:25:51.939 --> 03:25:53.574
THE THING THAT.

03:25:53.641 --> 03:25:55.209
THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

03:25:55.276 --> 03:25:57.178
DRAWING A DISTINCTION HERE.

03:25:57.244 --> 03:25:59.313
IS WHO PROVIDING THE PRODUCT AND

03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:02.450
WHEN THE DENTAL OFFICE LOOKS TO

03:26:02.516 --> 03:26:04.485
A AN UNSOPHISTICATED ANSWER CA

03:26:04.552 --> 03:26:05.886
CONSUMER LIKE THEY'RE THE ONES

03:26:05.953 --> 03:26:08.622
PROVIDING UP THE THE FINANCING.

03:26:08.689 --> 03:26:10.424
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION

03:26:10.491 --> 03:26:11.492
BECAUSE THAT THEY THINK THEIR

03:26:11.559 --> 03:26:12.560
RELATIONSHIP FINANCIAL

03:26:12.626 --> 03:26:13.994
RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THEIR

03:26:14.061 --> 03:26:15.596
MEDICAL PROVIDER RATHER THAN THE

03:26:15.663 --> 03:26:16.697
FINANCIAL PROVIDER.

03:26:16.764 --> 03:26:18.132
SO WHEN THINGS THAT THIS BILL IS

03:26:18.199 --> 03:26:19.567
TRYING TO DO A WE TRY TO DO WITH

03:26:19.633 --> 03:26:20.601
THE AMENDMENTS IS SEPARATE THAT

03:26:20.668 --> 03:26:21.936
TRANSACTION.

03:26:22.002 --> 03:26:23.904
IN A WAY THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR

03:26:23.971 --> 03:26:24.972
WHO'S PROVIDING THE THE

03:26:25.039 --> 03:26:26.307
FINANCIAL SERVICES WHOSE

03:26:26.373 --> 03:26:27.842
PROVIDING THE MEDICAL SERVICES.

03:26:27.908 --> 03:26:29.577
AND NOT CONFLATING THOSE TWO I I

03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:30.945
THINK PROBABLY ALL OF US WOULD

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.279
UNDERSTAND THAT GOING INTO A

03:26:32.346 --> 03:26:33.414
DENTAL OFFICE.

03:26:33.481 --> 03:26:35.649
BUT NOT ALL THE CONSUMERS DO.

03:26:35.716 --> 03:26:38.285
SO I THINK THERE'S POTENTIALLY

03:26:38.352 --> 03:26:41.322
SOME GROUND TO FIGURE THIS OUT

03:26:41.388 --> 03:26:42.490
AND AS WE HAD WORK THROUGH THIS.

03:26:42.556 --> 03:26:43.858
THE STAFF IN WITHOUT HIS OFFICE

03:26:43.924 --> 03:26:45.593
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS.

03:26:45.659 --> 03:26:47.561
IT PROVIDING SO FOR ME PROVIDING

03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:49.396
THAT CLARITY OF WHO'S PROVIDING

03:26:49.463 --> 03:26:51.065

OPTIONS AND NOTICE OF THOSE

03:26:54.401 --> 03:26:55.669
OPTIONS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT

03:26:55.736 --> 03:26:57.872
THEIR ENTRY INTO AND CAN SEE

03:26:57.938 --> 03:26:59.306
THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK

03:26:59.373 --> 03:27:00.708
THEY'LL BE WILLING TO PAY.

03:27:00.775 --> 03:27:02.143
THOSE OF THE SOME OF THE

03:27:02.209 --> 03:27:02.743
PROTECTIONS THAT I THINK WE'RE

03:27:02.810 --> 03:27:04.378
WORKING ON WE DO HAVE SOME TIME

03:27:04.445 --> 03:27:06.046

AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

03:27:09.150 --> 03:27:10.451
AS THIS MOVES I'M HOPING IT GETS

03:27:10.518 --> 03:27:11.719
OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY.

03:27:11.786 --> 03:27:14.355

SENATE -- ESPECIALLY AS PROPOSED

03:37:37.577 --> 03:37:39.913
TO BE AMENDED -- WE DO SEE THIS

03:37:39.980 --> 03:37:42.082
AS A FAR LESS RISKY AND FAR MORE

03:37:42.149 --> 03:37:43.784
RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO

03:37:43.850 --> 03:37:44.718
PAYDAY LENDING AND IS SOMETHING

03:37:44.785 --> 03:37:45.318
THAT.

03:37:45.385 --> 03:37:46.319
WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN

03:37:46.386 --> 03:37:47.254
WE'VE BEEN A PART OF SOME OF THE

03:37:47.320 --> 03:37:48.388
STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS THAT

03:37:48.455 --> 03:37:49.489
HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

03:37:49.556 --> 03:37:51.825
AND DO HAVE TWO REMAINING ISSUES

03:37:51.892 --> 03:37:54.060
THAT -- WE'RE WATCHING BOTH

03:37:54.127 --> 03:37:55.495
REVOLVE AROUND WORKER PRIVACY

03:37:55.562 --> 03:37:57.431
GENERALLY SPECIFICALLY WE'D LIKE

03:37:57.497 --> 03:37:58.698
TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS

03:37:58.765 --> 03:38:00.734
PERSONAL DATA ESPECIALLY RELATED

03:38:00.801 --> 03:38:01.735
TO THEIR FINANCES THEIR

03:38:01.802 --> 03:38:02.536
GEOLOCATION AREN'T.

03:38:02.602 --> 03:38:04.571
SOLD OFF TO THIRD PARTIES AND IT

03:38:04.638 --> 03:38:05.972
APPEARS THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE

03:38:06.039 --> 03:38:07.574
PROPOSED TO BE TAKEN IN THE BILL

03:38:07.641 --> 03:38:08.442
THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THAT.

03:38:08.508 --> 03:38:09.709
OR KIND OF NEW TO THE ISSUE AND

03:38:09.776 --> 03:38:10.610
SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

03:38:10.677 --> 03:38:11.711
THE LANGUAGE DOES WHAT WE THINK

03:38:11.778 --> 03:38:14.714
IT DOES AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO TO

03:38:14.781 --> 03:38:15.649
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE MAKE SURE

03:38:15.715 --> 03:38:16.383
THAT.

03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:18.552
EMPLOYERS AREN'T AWARE OF WHEN

03:38:18.618 --> 03:38:19.686
WORKERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

03:38:19.753 --> 03:38:21.221
THIS PROGRAM HOW MUCH MONEY THEY

03:38:21.288 --> 03:38:22.923
TOOK OUT THINGS LIKE THAT.

03:38:22.989 --> 03:38:23.790
JUST THE SAME WAY THAT A WORKER

03:38:23.857 --> 03:38:24.991
WOULDN'T WANT THEIR EMPLOYER TO

03:38:25.058 --> 03:38:25.992
KNOW THAT THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

03:38:26.059 --> 03:38:27.894
A PAYDAY LOAN OR WERE OTHERWISE

03:38:27.961 --> 03:38:29.329
FACING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES

03:38:29.396 --> 03:38:31.598
BUT OTHER THAN THAT AGAIN WE DO

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:32.833
THINK THIS CONCEPT MAKES SENSE

03:38:32.899 --> 03:38:34.100
AND TO SEE IS FAR PREFERABLE TO

03:38:34.167 --> 03:38:35.869
PAYDAY LENDING AND LOOK FORWARD.

03:38:35.936 --> 03:38:37.070

OPPORTUNITY MINUTES NOT A WORK

03:38:59.359 --> 03:39:01.361
ON THIS IN A VERY SHORT ORDER --

03:39:01.428 --> 03:39:02.462
AND OFTENTIMES SPECIALLY BEING

03:39:02.529 --> 03:39:03.396
IN SILICON VALLEY I HEARD THE

03:39:03.463 --> 03:39:05.699
WORD DESTRUCTIVE ALL THE TIME.

03:39:05.765 --> 03:39:08.468
THE USUALLY -- IS IS -- ARE

03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:10.237
SHORT OF THAT I THINK IN THIS

03:39:10.303 --> 03:39:11.004
CASE.

03:39:11.071 --> 03:39:11.905
WITH THIS COULD BEEN TECH

03:39:11.972 --> 03:39:13.773
DESTRUCTION I THINK IT REALLY IS

03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:15.809
A SELECTIVE IN A WAY THAT CAN

03:39:15.876 --> 03:39:16.877
THAT IS VERY GOOD.

03:39:16.943 --> 03:39:18.111
BUT IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE SURE

03:39:18.178 --> 03:39:20.280
IT STAYS THAT WAY AND DOESN'T

03:39:20.347 --> 03:39:22.449
BECOME A WHOLE NEW BE SO TO

03:39:22.516 --> 03:39:24.117

THE THAT INITIALLY DIDN'T START

03:39:27.254 --> 03:39:28.488
THAT WAY IT BECAME THAT WAY AND

03:39:28.555 --> 03:39:29.523
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE

03:39:29.589 --> 03:39:31.825
PUTTING IN REGULATIONS FROM DAY.

03:39:31.892 --> 03:39:33.660
ONE SO THAT THIS PRACTICE COULD

03:39:33.727 --> 03:39:35.629
BE MONITORED VERY CLOSELY A BY A

03:39:35.695 --> 03:39:41.568
BY US AS IT SHOULD BE -- THAT

03:39:41.635 --> 03:39:42.869
WORKERS ARE PROTECTED.

03:39:42.936 --> 03:39:44.170
I THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MONEY

03:39:44.237 --> 03:39:44.771
THAT THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED.

03:39:44.838 --> 03:39:45.372
AND IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT'S

03:39:45.438 --> 03:39:46.206
RESPONSIBLE THAT STILL ALLOWS

03:39:46.273 --> 03:39:48.108
FOR COMPANIES -- MEANT TO BE

03:39:48.174 --> 03:39:49.309
ABLE TO UP YOU'LL HAVE A

03:39:49.376 --> 03:39:50.310
BUSINESS MODEL THAT WORKS FOR

03:39:50.377 --> 03:39:51.878
THEM BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO

03:39:51.945 --> 03:39:53.079
US PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE

03:39:53.146 --> 03:39:54.247
WORKERS.

03:39:54.314 --> 03:39:56.216
AND YOU KNOW BUT EVEN AS YOU

03:39:56.283 --> 03:39:57.817

PREDATORY LENDING AND NOW WE'RE

03:40:03.356 --> 03:40:04.824
ON THE VERGE OF DOING SOMETHING

03:40:04.891 --> 03:40:07.360
I THINK A MONUMENTAL -- IN IN

03:40:07.427 --> 03:40:09.462
THE STATE TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN --

03:40:09.529 --> 03:40:10.697
THERE DOES NEED TO BE

03:40:10.764 --> 03:40:11.765
ALTERNATIVES AND I THE NASA BUT

EVERYONE IS AGREED WITH.

03:40:13.233 --> 03:40:14.534

REAL OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN

03:40:15.735 --> 03:40:17.537

SO SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:20.033
WORKING WITH US AND WE HAVE ONE

03:41:20.100 --> 03:41:20.867
OF THE CHALLENGES THERE COUPLE

03:41:20.934 --> 03:41:21.501
DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS THAT

03:41:21.568 --> 03:41:22.102
ARE OUT THERE ONE STRUCK TO

03:41:22.168 --> 03:41:22.736
CONSUMER AND ONE IS THROUGH AN

03:41:22.802 --> 03:41:23.003
EMPLOYER.

03:41:23.069 --> 03:41:24.571
AND EACH REPRESENTS SLIGHTLY

03:41:24.638 --> 03:41:25.739
DIFFERENT ISSUES WERE REGULATING

03:41:25.805 --> 03:41:27.540
OF IN THE SAME AND ONE THINGS WE

03:41:27.607 --> 03:41:28.808
MAY FIND OUT IS.

03:41:28.875 --> 03:41:30.210
THOSE TWO MODELS MAY HAVE

03:41:30.276 --> 03:41:31.511
DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS.

03:41:31.578 --> 03:41:33.513
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO I THINK

03:41:33.580 --> 03:41:35.015
REALLY LOOK AT HOW.

03:41:35.081 --> 03:41:37.484
THIS INDUSTRY DEVELOPS HOW IT

03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:39.486
GETS USE WHAT THE THE WHAT THE

03:41:39.552 --> 03:41:40.720
IMPACTS ARE POTENTIALLY ON

03:41:40.787 --> 03:41:42.389
CONSUMERS THROUGH THIS I I THINK

03:41:42.455 --> 03:41:43.623
IT IS INTERESTING.

03:41:43.690 --> 03:41:44.858
THIS IS MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY

03:41:44.924 --> 03:41:45.859
BEEN EARNED AND IN THE

03:41:45.925 --> 03:41:48.995
EMPLOYMENT CONTACTS WHERE THAT.

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:50.697
PROVIDERS WORKING WITH AN

03:41:50.764 --> 03:41:51.731
EMPLOYER THINK THAT'S A LOT

03:41:51.798 --> 03:41:53.266
EASIER TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE

03:41:53.333 --> 03:41:54.300
DIRECT TO CONSUMER.

03:41:54.367 --> 03:41:56.369
A LITTLE BIT LESS SO AND I THINK

03:41:56.436 --> 03:41:58.872
THAT PRESENTS SOME RISK SO WERE

03:41:58.938 --> 03:42:00.473
ON AN INTERESTING JOURNEY HERE

03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:02.108
CENTER THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT US ON

03:42:02.175 --> 03:42:03.443
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY PRODUCTIVE

03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:05.345
AND AND SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL

03:42:05.412 --> 03:42:06.046
BE.

03:42:06.112 --> 03:42:11.951
BE ABLE TO TRACK PRETTY CLOSELY

THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING.

03:42:15.288 --> 03:42:16.222
I THINK IT ALSO RAISES THE

03:42:16.289 --> 03:42:17.924
QUESTION AND TALKING WITH A

03:42:17.991 --> 03:42:19.893

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.302
THE PAST AT AT SOME POINT.

03:42:29.369 --> 03:42:30.870
IS WHY NOT BE ABLE TO BE PAID.

03:42:30.937 --> 03:42:32.872

03:55:34.286 --> 03:55:36.455
ABOUT THE USE OF OUR MERCHANTS

03:55:36.522 --> 03:55:38.591
HE REGULATIONS IN THE BILL.

03:55:38.657 --> 03:55:40.125
I'M OF COURSE ALONG WITH THE

03:55:40.192 --> 03:55:41.827
AUTHOR WE'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS

03:55:41.894 --> 03:55:43.195
THOSE AND I THINK TAKE --

03:55:43.262 --> 03:55:44.864
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS HAS

03:55:44.930 --> 03:55:48.067
RAISED SOME INTERESTING WAYS TO

03:55:48.133 --> 03:55:49.502
ADDRESS THOSE BUT I DO JUST

03:55:49.568 --> 03:55:51.871
WANNA -- EXPLAIN THAT THE GOAL

03:55:51.937 --> 03:55:53.839
OF AUTHORIZING THE USE OF

03:55:53.906 --> 03:55:55.274
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. TO ALLOW

03:55:55.341 --> 03:55:58.210
STATE AGENCIES TO ACT QUICKLY.

03:55:58.277 --> 03:55:59.645
SO THAT THERE'S NO GAP IN THE

03:55:59.712 --> 03:56:01.780
PROTECTIONS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

03:56:01.847 --> 03:56:03.682
IN PLACE IF A FEDERAL ROLLBACK

03:56:03.749 --> 03:56:05.117
OCCURS.

03:56:05.184 --> 03:56:06.952
AS YOU KNOW REGULAR RULEMAKING

03:56:07.019 --> 03:56:08.654
CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR

03:56:08.721 --> 03:56:09.655
EXAMPLE THE STATE WATER

03:56:09.722 --> 03:56:12.625
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD JUST

03:56:12.691 --> 03:56:14.059
COMPLETED.

03:56:14.126 --> 03:56:15.261
A RULE MAKING FOR NEW WETLANDS

03:56:15.327 --> 03:56:16.962
PROTECTIONS FOR THE STATE.

03:56:17.029 --> 03:56:18.364
BUT IT TOOK THE MORE THAN TWELVE

03:56:18.430 --> 03:56:21.400
YEARS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

04:09:14.506 --> 04:09:16.775
IT MAY BE IF BOTH OF YOU YOU

04:09:16.841 --> 04:09:18.243
KNOW THE PROPONENT.

04:09:28.186 --> 04:09:30.055
DO MAYBE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON

04:09:30.121 --> 04:09:32.290
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.

04:09:32.357 --> 04:09:34.225
THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER -- A

04:09:34.292 --> 04:09:35.527
COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL THIS

04:09:35.593 --> 04:09:38.129
IS A COMPLICATED AREA OF LAW TO

04:09:38.196 --> 04:09:39.431
BE SURE AND I REPORT I THINK

04:09:39.497 --> 04:09:42.133
SENATOR ATKINS RECOGNIZES THAT --

04:09:42.200 --> 04:09:44.035
THE COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY

04:09:44.102 --> 04:09:45.537
THAT HERE THESE ISSUES OFTEN ARE

04:09:45.603 --> 04:09:46.471
THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEES

04:09:46.538 --> 04:09:47.906
ENOUGH TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO

04:09:47.972 --> 04:09:51.443
I REALIZE THIS IS A CHALLENGING.

04:09:51.509 --> 04:09:54.546
SUBJECT AREA TO BE REVIEWING --

04:09:54.612 --> 04:09:55.246
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TWO

04:09:55.313 --> 04:09:57.649
THINGS ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO

04:09:57.716 --> 04:09:59.117
DELISTING AND THE CONCERN THE

04:09:59.184 --> 04:10:00.618
OPPONENTS OF RACE AND AND I

04:10:00.685 --> 04:10:01.853
AGAIN EMPHASIZE WE HAVE WORKED

04:10:01.920 --> 04:10:03.488
CLOSELY WITH THE OPPONENTS AND

04:10:03.555 --> 04:10:04.856
CONSTRUCTIVELY TO TRY TO ADDRESS

04:10:04.923 --> 04:10:05.890
THESE ISSUES.

04:10:05.957 --> 04:10:07.258
AND I BELIEVE CENTER ATKINS

04:10:07.325 --> 04:10:09.527
WANTS TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE

04:10:09.594 --> 04:10:11.296
THE OPPONENTS -- WITHDRAW THEIR

04:10:11.363 --> 04:10:15.900
OPPOSITION BUT I WOULD SAY TO

04:10:15.967 --> 04:10:16.735
YOU -- IN.

04:10:16.801 --> 04:10:17.402
RESPONSE TO THE CONCERN THAT THE

04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:19.571
SOMEHOW FREEZES THE SCIENCE AND

04:10:19.637 --> 04:10:21.706
DOESN'T PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY

04:10:21.773 --> 04:10:24.142
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT THE

04:10:24.209 --> 04:10:25.510
THE CONCERN IS.

04:10:25.577 --> 04:10:28.012
THAT THE OPPONENTS HAVE.

04:10:28.079 --> 04:10:29.080
PLEASE LOOK AT PAGE FIFTEEN OF

04:10:29.147 --> 04:10:31.483
THE BILL LINES TWELVE THROUGH.

04:10:31.549 --> 04:10:32.751
EIGHTEEN AND I DON'T WANT TO

04:10:32.817 --> 04:10:34.319
READ THEM TO THE COMMITTEE BUT

04:10:34.386 --> 04:10:35.987
IT VERY CLEARLY SAYS THE

04:10:36.054 --> 04:10:36.955
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

04:10:37.021 --> 04:10:39.324
THIS IS THE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES

04:10:39.391 --> 04:10:39.924
THE LISTING IN THE LISTING OF

04:10:39.991 --> 04:10:40.692
SPECIES.

04:10:40.759 --> 04:10:41.926
SHALL ENSURE THAT THE

04:10:41.993 --> 04:10:43.628
PROTECTIONS ARE AT LEAST AS

04:10:43.695 --> 04:10:45.997
PROTECTIVE AS FEDERAL LAW NUMBER.

04:10:46.064 --> 04:10:48.099
ONE AND NUMBER TWO ACCORDING TO

04:10:48.166 --> 04:10:49.300
THE BEST AVAILABLE SILENT

04:10:49.367 --> 04:10:51.369
SCIENCE SO THAT IS AN EXPLICIT

04:10:51.436 --> 04:10:52.804
DIRECTIVE.

04:10:52.871 --> 04:10:53.905
TO OUR STATE AGENCY THAT

04:10:53.972 --> 04:10:55.974
OVERSEES ENDANGERED SPECIES TO

04:10:56.040 --> 04:10:57.142
MAKE SURE THAT THE SCIENCE THAT

04:10:57.208 --> 04:10:58.376
THEY USE TO MAKE THE

04:10:58.443 --> 04:10:59.411
DETERMINATIONS HERE.

04:10:59.477 --> 04:11:00.812
ARE IS THE BEST AVAILABLE

04:11:00.879 --> 04:11:02.547
SCIENCE OF WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:04.048
THAT DOESN'T FREEZE ANYTHING IN

04:11:04.115 --> 04:11:05.917
PLACE OF BACK TO GIVES DIRECTION

04:11:05.984 --> 04:11:06.851
TO THE AGENCY.

04:11:06.918 --> 04:11:07.786
THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE

04:11:07.852 --> 04:11:09.454
ON THIS ISSUE IS.

04:11:09.521 --> 04:11:11.456
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

04:11:11.523 --> 04:11:13.691
THIS CONTEXT -- WATER AND

04:11:13.758 --> 04:11:16.027
ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THAT

04:11:16.094 --> 04:11:18.263
WORLD RIGHT NOW IS IN FLUX AS

04:11:18.329 --> 04:11:19.831
FOR THE THOSE PARTIES TO FOLLOW

04:11:19.898 --> 04:11:20.799
THESE ISSUES.

04:11:20.865 --> 04:11:23.401
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MOVING

04:11:23.468 --> 04:11:26.438
FAIRLY AGGRESSIVELY TO REDUCE

04:11:26.504 --> 04:11:27.539
THE US STANDARDS AND

04:11:27.605 --> 04:11:28.940
REQUIREMENTS ON THE CENTRAL

04:11:29.007 --> 04:11:30.875
VALLEY PROJECT AND ON A ON OTHER

04:11:30.942 --> 04:11:32.277
WATER SUPPLIES IN CALIFORNIA.

04:11:32.343 --> 04:11:34.212
SO THEY'RE IN THEIR CHANGING AND

04:11:34.279 --> 04:11:36.214
THE IDEA HERE IT IS AGAIN NOT TO

04:11:36.281 --> 04:11:37.882
INCREASE THE REQUIREMENTS BUT

04:11:37.949 --> 04:11:39.484
RATHER TO KEEP IN PLACE WHAT HAS

04:11:39.551 --> 04:11:40.752
BEEN IN PLACE AND HAS BEEN

04:11:40.819 --> 04:11:43.288
ACCEPTED -- REQUIREMENTS OF

04:11:43.354 --> 04:11:45.123
CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW

04:11:45.190 --> 04:11:46.724
FOR MANY YEARS AND SO I WOULD

04:11:46.791 --> 04:11:48.159
JUST SAY CENTER ACTIONS WANTS TO

04:11:48.226 --> 04:11:49.394
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

04:11:49.461 --> 04:11:50.462
BEEN RAISED HERE.

04:11:50.528 --> 04:11:52.997
AND IS LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE

04:11:53.064 --> 04:11:54.732
OPPONENTS CONCERNS BUT I THINK

04:11:54.799 --> 04:11:56.734
HER RESPONSES IF IT CROSSES THAT

04:11:56.801 --> 04:11:59.070
LINE INTO ALLOWING A WEAKENING

04:11:59.137 --> 04:12:00.572
OF THE EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE

04:12:00.638 --> 04:12:02.273
STANDARDS I THINK SHE HAS

04:12:02.340 --> 04:12:03.708
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS.

04:12:03.775 --> 04:12:05.176
ON ENDANGERED AND THREATENED

04:12:05.243 --> 04:12:07.045
SPECIES I'D ALSO LIKE TO LET

04:12:07.111 --> 04:12:13.351
KATE A POOL RESPOND TO THIS

04:12:13.418 --> 04:12:14.719
ISSUE.

04:12:14.786 --> 04:12:15.353
SURE.

04:12:15.420 --> 04:12:16.921
I'M THE LISTING FOR UP.

04:12:16.988 --> 04:12:18.790
QUESTION IN PARTICULAR

04:12:18.857 --> 04:12:19.090
[inaudible]

04:12:19.157 --> 04:12:20.892
I'D -- POINT THE COMMITTEE TO

04:12:20.959 --> 04:12:22.694
SECTION ONE TWO ZERO ZERO SIX

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:23.161
ONE BE OF THE BILL.

04:12:23.228 --> 04:12:24.095
THERE'S NO AUTOMATIC LISTING SO

04:12:24.162 --> 04:12:24.863
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AT THE

04:12:24.929 --> 04:12:27.899
FEDERAL LEVEL TO DO YOU LAST.

04:12:27.966 --> 04:12:30.068
WHATEVER SPECIES WHAT HAPPENS

04:12:30.134 --> 04:12:32.270
UNDER THIS BILL IS THAT THE

04:12:32.337 --> 04:12:33.605
FISHING GAME COMMISSION THEN.

04:12:33.671 --> 04:12:37.242
IT TRIGGERS A PROCESS WHERE THEY

04:12:37.308 --> 04:12:39.677
TAKE A SORT OF EXPEDITED LOOK AT

04:12:39.744 --> 04:12:41.212
THAT THE LISTING.

04:12:41.279 --> 04:12:43.815
AND BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:12:43.882 --> 04:12:46.584
FISH AND WILDLIFE'S INPUT THEY

04:12:46.651 --> 04:12:48.586
EITHER SORT OF LISTED

04:12:48.653 --> 04:12:51.923
IMMEDIATELY THEY DETERMINE --

04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:54.192
THAT LISTING IS NOT WARRANTED OR

04:12:54.259 --> 04:12:55.393
THEY DETERMINE THAT IT SHOULD GO

04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:57.128
THROUGH THE REGULAR LISTING

04:12:57.195 --> 04:13:00.231
PROCESS SO.

04:13:00.298 --> 04:13:02.367
IT ALL IS STILL -- THIS TRIGGERS

04:13:02.433 --> 04:13:04.936
A PROCESS BY WHICH THE EXPERT

04:13:05.003 --> 04:13:07.171
AGENCIES CAN REVIEW THE UP.

04:13:07.238 --> 04:13:09.607
OKAY AND JUST OPPOSITION YOU

04:13:09.674 --> 04:13:10.708

04:13:11.943 --> 04:13:13.244
WILLINGNESS.

04:13:13.311 --> 04:13:14.012
TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL

04:13:14.078 --> 04:13:14.913
AMENDMENTS ARE THERE CERTAIN

04:13:14.979 --> 04:13:16.247
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WOULD

04:13:16.314 --> 04:13:20.051
REQUEST GOING FOR THAT WOULD

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:20.251

WELL I WANT TO RESPOND TO THE

04:13:23.021 --> 04:13:23.655
OTHER VERY BEETLE I THINK IT'S A

04:13:23.721 --> 04:13:25.223
GOOD EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY WAS

04:13:25.290 --> 04:13:27.425
PROPOSED FOR DELISTING. SIX

04:13:27.492 --> 04:13:29.060
SEVEN YEARS AGO SO NOT EVEN

04:13:29.127 --> 04:13:30.161
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION AND

04:13:30.228 --> 04:13:31.429
REALLY QUESTION COULD YOU JUST

04:13:31.496 --> 04:13:32.730
ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:13:32.797 --> 04:13:36.734
AMENDMENTS ABOUT YES.

04:13:36.801 --> 04:13:37.635

THIS ISSUE INCLUDING THE

04:13:39.137 --> 04:13:40.605
DELISTING BUT WHAT COULD BE

04:13:40.672 --> 04:13:43.408
CHANGED ALSO IN THE BILL TO HELP

04:13:43.474 --> 04:13:44.309
WITH THAT SITUATION.

04:13:44.375 --> 04:13:45.977
BUT I COULD BE BRIEF ABOUT THAT

04:13:46.044 --> 04:13:49.581
THESE ARE REALLY MORE ISSUES FOR

04:13:49.647 --> 04:13:51.282
OTHER JURORS ARE THERE

04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:52.250
COMMITTEES JURISDICTION.

04:13:52.317 --> 04:13:52.984
WHAT THE THE PROBLEM WAS IT

04:13:53.051 --> 04:13:54.118
DIDN'T GO TO PARKS AND WILDLIFE

04:13:54.185 --> 04:13:54.686
TO THIS ISSUE HASN'T BEEN

04:13:54.752 --> 04:13:56.454
DAYLIGHT DANNY IS THE LAST

04:13:56.521 --> 04:13:58.356
POLICY COMMITTEES THAT TO THE?

04:13:58.423 --> 04:14:00.425
HOW TO RESPECT I CAN ANSWER THE

04:14:00.491 --> 04:14:01.225
QUESTION ALL ALL THOSE AS A

04:14:01.292 --> 04:14:02.694
QUESTION?

JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS FAIR

04:14:03.595 --> 04:14:05.263
ENOUGH. TO TO RESPOND YES IT

04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:06.264
SAYS BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE

04:14:06.331 --> 04:14:07.799
HOWEVER THE BUILDING CONSISTENT

04:14:07.865 --> 04:14:10.401
INTERNALLY IF YOU LOOK ON LINES

04:14:10.468 --> 04:14:12.203
TWENTY THREE THROUGH TWENTY NINE

04:14:12.270 --> 04:14:13.671
OF PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE BILL.

04:14:13.738 --> 04:14:14.706
IT'S AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

04:14:14.772 --> 04:14:19.110
AND WILDLIFE SHALL ENSURE THAT

04:14:19.177 --> 04:14:21.079
THE PROTECTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE.

04:14:21.145 --> 04:14:22.413
WE AS ATTORNEYS READ THAT ADDS

04:14:22.480 --> 04:14:23.615
BASICALLY FREEZING IN PLACE IT

04:14:23.681 --> 04:14:24.182
AND USE THE WORD FREEZE BUT

04:14:24.248 --> 04:14:24.949
SHALL ENSURE THE PROTECTION

04:14:25.016 --> 04:14:25.516
REMAIN IN PLACE.

04:14:25.583 --> 04:14:27.085
IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE

04:14:27.151 --> 04:14:28.353
BIOLOGICAL PINIONS THE INTERNAL

04:14:28.419 --> 04:14:29.554
TAKE PERMITS BASICALLY THE

04:14:29.621 --> 04:14:31.255
PERMIT LEVELS ARE BEING FROZEN

04:14:31.322 --> 04:14:33.091
IN TIME YOU CAN THROW AT THE END

04:14:33.157 --> 04:14:35.293
OF THE SENTENCE BEST AVAILABLE

04:14:35.360 --> 04:14:36.260
SCIENCE IT DOESN'T.

04:14:36.327 --> 04:14:37.829
CHANGE THAT THEY SHALL ENSURE

04:14:37.895 --> 04:14:38.663
THE PROTECTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE

04:14:38.730 --> 04:14:40.365
SO IT'S VERY LEAST IT'S

04:14:40.431 --> 04:14:41.633
INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT.

04:14:41.699 --> 04:14:42.700
JUST SO EVERYONE ELSE'S AWARE

04:14:42.767 --> 04:14:44.502
WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT

04:14:44.569 --> 04:14:45.970
DEAL WITH THE DOWN LISTING AND

04:14:46.037 --> 04:14:47.872
THE LISTING ISSUE TO THE EXTENT

04:14:47.939 --> 04:14:49.140

WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT

ALLOWS THE FISH AND GAME

04:14:54.278 --> 04:14:56.481
COMMISSION TO STEP IN AND REVIEW

04:14:56.547 --> 04:14:57.248
WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

04:14:57.315 --> 04:14:58.483
LISTED UNDER THE ENDANGERED

04:14:58.549 --> 04:15:00.118
SPECIES ACT CALIFORNIA'S VERSION

04:15:00.184 --> 04:15:00.985

04:15:01.052 --> 04:15:02.053
AND WE PROPOSED TO MEMBERS THAT

04:15:02.120 --> 04:15:03.388
DURING THAT INTERIM REVIEW

04:15:03.454 --> 04:15:05.823
PROCESS THE PROTECTIONS UNDER

04:15:05.890 --> 04:15:06.958

04:15:10.194 --> 04:15:11.763
PERIOD SO THAT THERE IS NO GAP

04:15:11.829 --> 04:15:13.564
THAT'S THURMOND PROPOSED.

04:15:13.631 --> 04:15:17.335
WE'VE ALSO. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

04:15:17.402 --> 04:15:18.036
THAT.

04:15:18.102 --> 04:15:19.103
THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION.

04:15:19.170 --> 04:15:20.438
ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE BILL

04:15:20.505 --> 04:15:22.240
LINES FOURTEEN THROUGH EIGHTEEN

04:15:22.306 --> 04:15:23.241
BASICALLY SAYS.

04:15:23.307 --> 04:15:25.576
THEY'RE DOING THE REVIEW WITHOUT

04:15:25.643 --> 04:15:27.478
THE REGULAR LISTING PROCESS SET

04:15:27.545 --> 04:15:28.546
FORTH UNDER THE FISHING GAME

04:15:28.613 --> 04:15:30.281
CODE SO WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE

04:15:30.348 --> 04:15:31.549
FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WILL BE

04:15:31.616 --> 04:15:32.617
ANALYZING THE SPECIES.

04:15:32.684 --> 04:15:34.719
IT'S INACCURATE TO SAY THAT THIS

04:15:34.786 --> 04:15:35.319
IS GOING TO BE DONE HOW THEY

04:15:35.386 --> 04:15:36.287
NORMALLY DO IT.

04:15:36.354 --> 04:15:37.388
THEY'RE DOING UNDER A VERY

04:15:37.455 --> 04:15:38.990
EXPEDITED TIMELINE WITHOUT

04:15:39.057 --> 04:15:40.825
FOLLOWING THE REGULAR LISTING

04:15:40.892 --> 04:15:43.227
PROCESS SO AGAIN THAT IS NOT

04:15:43.294 --> 04:15:44.395
CONSISTENT WITH INTENT TO

04:15:44.462 --> 04:15:46.030
PRESERVING EXISTING STANDARDS WE

04:15:46.097 --> 04:15:47.231
HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT

04:15:47.298 --> 04:15:49.500
ALLOW THEM TO LOOK AT THE LIST

04:15:49.567 --> 04:15:51.035
AT DALLAS THAT SPECIES.

04:15:51.102 --> 04:15:51.803
PLACE THEM ON SEATS IF IT'S

04:15:51.869 --> 04:15:53.304
APPROPRIATE BUT THEY SHOULD DO

04:15:53.371 --> 04:15:54.739
SO UNDER EXISTING SEES A

04:15:54.806 --> 04:15:55.807
FRAMEWORK.

04:15:55.873 --> 04:15:58.142
AND THEY GET THE PROTECTIONS IN

04:15:58.209 --> 04:16:00.778
PLACE WHILE THAT PERIODS IN

04:16:00.845 --> 04:16:01.779
ORDER TO ADD TO SEE SAID YES

04:16:01.846 --> 04:16:06.217
THEY HONOR TO ALL GO RIGHT TO

04:16:06.284 --> 04:16:08.319
YOU MISS PEER -- SO THOSE WERE

04:16:08.386 --> 04:16:08.886
TWO THINGS THAT I THINK ARE

04:16:08.953 --> 04:16:09.821
REALLY GOOD POINT SIR ARE THE IS

04:16:09.887 --> 04:16:10.455
THAT SOMETHING WE COULD INSERT

04:16:10.521 --> 04:16:11.089
IN THE LANGUAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE

04:16:11.155 --> 04:16:12.123
ON THE SHALL KEEP PROTECTIONS IN

04:16:12.190 --> 04:16:13.424
PLACE.

04:16:13.491 --> 04:16:15.159
YOU'RE UNLESS BEST AVAILABLE

04:16:15.226 --> 04:16:16.828
SCIENCE.

04:16:16.894 --> 04:16:18.062
REQUIRES OTHERWISE OR YOU KNOW

04:16:18.129 --> 04:16:19.530
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IS THAT

04:16:19.597 --> 04:16:20.998
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO AND

04:16:21.065 --> 04:16:23.501
THEN AND THEN IN CODING IN THERE

04:16:23.568 --> 04:16:24.102
THAT IT HAS TO BE THE REGULAR

04:16:24.168 --> 04:16:25.269
SEAS.

04:16:25.336 --> 04:16:26.537
PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT THAT YOU

04:16:26.604 --> 04:16:28.706
WERE BRINGING UP YES I MEAN AT

04:16:28.773 --> 04:16:29.941
THAT THE ISSUE IS THIS BILL

04:16:30.007 --> 04:16:30.675
POTENTIALLY CREATES A TON OF

04:16:30.742 --> 04:16:31.843
LITIGATION WITH HOW IT'S

04:16:31.909 --> 04:16:33.511
STRUCTURED WE PROPOSE AMENDMENTS

04:16:33.578 --> 04:16:34.979
THAT STILL PROTECT THE SPECIES

04:16:35.046 --> 04:16:36.514
FROM DALLAS IN DELISTING.

04:16:36.581 --> 04:16:38.549
WITHOUT CREATING A NEW WHAT'S A

04:16:38.616 --> 04:16:40.451
LESS PROTECTIVE STANDARD UNDER

04:16:40.518 --> 04:16:42.153
EXISTING SEES A WHAT WE'VE A

04:16:42.220 --> 04:16:44.555
JEOPARDY STANDARD THERE'S A FIVE

04:16:44.622 --> 04:16:46.224
RECOGNIZE LAW NOT DIRECTED.

04:16:46.290 --> 04:16:46.824
RIGHT SO I MEAN ARE YOU HAVING

04:16:46.891 --> 04:16:47.391
RIGHT I MEAN HE DO YOU THINK

04:16:47.458 --> 04:16:48.659
THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ROOM ON

04:16:48.726 --> 04:16:49.393
THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR MISTER

04:16:49.460 --> 04:16:50.995
GALLAGHER SENATOR ATKINS IS VERY

04:16:51.062 --> 04:16:52.764
OPEN TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES

04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:53.998
THE SPECIFIC CHANGES PROPOSED I

04:16:54.065 --> 04:16:54.999
WANNA MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE

04:16:55.066 --> 04:16:56.267
MEMBERS UNDERSTAND.

04:16:56.334 --> 04:16:57.435
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

04:16:57.502 --> 04:16:59.070
REGULAR LISTING PROCESS WE ARE

04:16:59.137 --> 04:17:00.471
TALKING ABOUT ACTIONS AT THE

04:17:00.538 --> 04:17:02.707
FEDERAL LEVEL THAT ARE WEAKENING

04:17:02.774 --> 04:17:04.575
THE EXISTING PROCESS AND ALL

04:17:04.642 --> 04:17:05.510
WE'RE SAYING IS KEEP THOSE

04:17:05.576 --> 04:17:07.111
STANDARDS IN PLACE.

04:17:07.178 --> 04:17:08.079
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN

04:17:08.146 --> 04:17:10.081
LISTING A NEW SPECIES OR DE

04:17:10.148 --> 04:17:11.749
LISTING A SPECIES IT'S SAYING

04:17:11.816 --> 04:17:13.718
WHAT EXISTS TODAY THAT IS BEING

04:17:13.785 --> 04:17:15.186
ROLLED BACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

04:17:15.253 --> 04:17:16.921
SHOULD BE KEPT IN PLACE.

04:17:16.988 --> 04:17:19.423
WITH RESPECT TO MISTER REGULARS

04:17:19.490 --> 04:17:21.626
CONCERN ABOUT THE BEST AVAILABLE

04:17:21.692 --> 04:17:22.393
SCIENCE.

04:17:22.460 --> 04:17:23.694
THIS IS THE FIRST THAT WE'RE

04:17:23.761 --> 04:17:24.796
HEARING THAT BECAUSE THE PRO TEM

04:17:24.862 --> 04:17:26.798
ADDED THAT LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY

04:17:26.864 --> 04:17:28.432
TO SAY WE'RE NOT FREEZING

04:17:28.499 --> 04:17:29.700
ANYTHING IN PLACE WHAT WERE

04:17:29.767 --> 04:17:31.068
FREEZING IN PLACES.

04:17:31.135 --> 04:17:32.837
THE PROTECTIONS BASED ON THE

04:17:32.904 --> 04:17:34.172
BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND

04:17:34.238 --> 04:17:35.606
THAT'S HOW THAT SENTENCE READS.

04:17:35.673 --> 04:17:36.707
I'M NOT I HAVE TO GO BACK AND

04:17:36.774 --> 04:17:37.975
DUST OFF MY ENGLISH BOOKS FROM

04:17:38.042 --> 04:17:39.510
HIGH SCHOOL BUT IF THERE'S A

04:17:39.577 --> 04:17:40.912
BETTER WAY TO WRITE IT TO MAKE

04:17:40.978 --> 04:17:41.913
IT MORE CLEAR WERE.

04:17:41.979 --> 04:17:43.014
MORE I KNOW THE PART TIME WOULD

04:17:43.080 --> 04:17:45.216
BE MORE THAN OPEN TO DOING THAT

04:17:45.283 --> 04:17:46.684
OKAY.

04:17:46.751 --> 04:17:48.553
AND YES MISS HIGHER I COULD

04:17:48.619 --> 04:17:50.021
SPEAK THERE'S A THERE'S A

04:17:50.087 --> 04:17:51.355
CONCERN ABOUT WHAT BLESSED

04:17:51.422 --> 04:17:51.889
PROTECTED MEANS ARE EQUAL

04:17:51.956 --> 04:17:53.925
PROTECTED ESA FEDERAL USA AND

04:17:53.991 --> 04:17:54.525
THE CALIFORNIA DINNERS BECAUSE

04:17:54.592 --> 04:17:55.660
ACT ARE VERY DIFFERENT THEY HAVE

04:17:55.726 --> 04:17:56.994
DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR TAKE.

04:17:57.061 --> 04:17:58.262
THEY COVER DIFFERENT TYPES OF

04:17:58.329 --> 04:17:59.597
THINGS THEY COVER DIFFERENT

04:17:59.664 --> 04:18:01.065
SPECIES SO IT'S VERY UNCLEAR

04:18:01.132 --> 04:18:02.066
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REMAIN IN

04:18:02.133 --> 04:18:04.202
PLACE DOES THAT MEAN THAT

04:18:04.268 --> 04:18:04.836
DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE IS

04:18:04.902 --> 04:18:05.636
NOW.

04:18:05.703 --> 04:18:07.638
ESSENTIALLY ADOPTING FEDERAL ESA

04:18:07.705 --> 04:18:09.173
STANDARDS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

04:18:09.240 --> 04:18:10.908
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IT'S VERY

04:18:10.975 --> 04:18:12.443
UNCLEAR WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS

04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:13.678
AND AND HOW THIS ACTUALLY PLAYS

04:18:13.744 --> 04:18:16.380
OUT WHAT STANDARDS DFW EVEN USES.

04:18:16.447 --> 04:18:17.682
TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS NOT

04:18:17.748 --> 04:18:19.317
THE LISTING PROCESS BUT THIS

04:18:19.383 --> 04:18:20.885
REMAIN IN PLACE IN THE

04:18:20.952 --> 04:18:22.353
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS.

04:18:22.420 --> 04:18:30.161
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT I

04:18:30.228 --> 04:18:31.629
MEAN THEY ARE THEY ARE DIFFERENT.

04:18:31.696 --> 04:18:33.264
AND SO HOW IT MAYBE MAYBE

04:18:33.331 --> 04:18:35.199
CLARIFY THAT IN LAW WHAT I WAS

04:18:35.266 --> 04:18:35.499
THE HELP.

04:18:35.566 --> 04:18:36.133
AND I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

04:18:36.200 --> 04:18:36.734
COMES TO A LOT OF OUR WATER

04:18:36.801 --> 04:18:37.368
RESOURCES PROJECTS THAT WE'RE

04:18:37.435 --> 04:18:38.035
WORKING ON HER IN PROGRESS RIGHT

04:18:38.102 --> 04:18:38.236
NOW.

04:18:38.302 --> 04:18:38.603
HOW THAT GETS?

04:18:38.669 --> 04:18:39.470
INTERPRETED.

04:18:39.537 --> 04:18:41.772
RAY IS GONNA MAKE IS A BIG

04:18:41.839 --> 04:18:43.474
DIFFERENCE RIGHT AND SO.

04:18:43.541 --> 04:18:44.542
I THINK IF WE COULD WORK ON

04:18:44.609 --> 04:18:47.178
THOSE THOSE ISSUES IT WOULD BE

04:18:47.245 --> 04:18:48.679
REALLY HELPFUL GOING FORWARD I

THE OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN VERY

04:18:52.216 --> 04:18:54.118
GOOD AND CONSTRUCTIVE ON THIS

04:18:54.185 --> 04:18:55.286
BILL THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

04:18:55.353 --> 04:18:56.454
WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND.

04:18:56.520 --> 04:18:57.989
SOLUTION ON THIS ALONG WITH THE

04:18:58.055 --> 04:18:59.624
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT

04:18:59.690 --> 04:19:02.593
QUESTION THAT THE CHAIR AND THE

04:19:02.660 --> 04:19:05.429
COMMITTEE AS WE HAVE RAISED.

04:19:05.496 --> 04:19:08.032
I THINK LESSONS.

04:19:08.099 --> 04:19:11.068
COMMENTS THIS PETRIE-NORRIS

04:19:11.135 --> 04:19:11.369

A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING THAT'S

04:19:27.451 --> 04:19:28.753

04:19:35.359 --> 04:19:36.994
I THINK PROTECTING THE EXISTING

04:19:37.061 --> 04:19:39.196
STANDARDS IS A QUESTION THE

04:19:39.263 --> 04:19:40.498
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE

04:19:40.564 --> 04:19:41.699
EXISTING STANDARDS THEY'RE BEING

04:19:41.766 --> 04:19:43.401
CHANGED RIGHT NOW UNDER THE

04:19:43.467 --> 04:19:44.468
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

04:19:44.535 --> 04:19:45.703
WASHINGTON DC.

04:19:45.770 --> 04:19:47.238
THERE HAVE BEEN LONG STANDING

04:19:47.305 --> 04:19:49.273
DISPUTES AMONG PARTIES ABOUT

04:19:49.340 --> 04:19:50.074
WHAT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE

04:19:50.141 --> 04:19:51.108
WHETHER THE STATE ENDANGERED

SPECIES ACTION CONTROL OF THE

04:19:52.944 --> 04:19:53.611
FEDERAL ACT.

04:19:53.678 --> 04:19:55.346
AND SOME OF THAT IS PLAYING OUT

04:19:55.413 --> 04:19:56.180
HERE SO I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR

04:19:56.247 --> 04:19:58.082
WITH YOU BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE

04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:59.050

CLEAR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

04:20:19.704 --> 04:20:21.072
NOT TRYING TO RAISE THE

ARE.

04:21:21.932 --> 04:21:23.534
MORE GRANULAR THAN THE ERROR

04:21:23.601 --> 04:21:25.302
WATER PROVISIONS -- IS NOT

04:21:25.369 --> 04:21:27.438
ACCURATE AND THE REASON I SAY

THAT IS BECAUSE THE AIR WATER

A BASIC LEVEL JUST AS BIOLOGICAL

04:21:43.254 --> 04:21:45.289
OPINIONS AND OTHER TOOLS ARE

04:21:45.356 --> 04:21:47.191
USED IN THE INTEREST SPECIES ACT

04:21:47.258 --> 04:21:47.725
WORLD.

04:21:47.792 --> 04:21:49.527
OUR PERMIT CONDITIONS SO I THINK

04:21:49.593 --> 04:21:51.562
THERE'S A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT

04:21:51.629 --> 04:21:53.230
THERE -- IN TERMS OF HOW

04:21:53.297 --> 04:21:54.999
GRANULAR THE ANALYSIS AND

04:21:55.066 --> 04:21:55.833

04:22:03.007 --> 04:22:03.140
OKAY.

04:22:03.207 --> 04:22:05.142
SEP BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE

BILL TODAY AND I'M ENCOURAGED TO

04:22:07.678 --> 04:22:07.912
HEAR THAT.

04:22:07.978 --> 04:22:09.380
YOUR CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE

04:22:09.447 --> 04:22:10.781
OPPOSITION IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

04:22:10.848 --> 04:22:11.882
THAT WE CAN RESOLVE CONDITION

04:22:11.949 --> 04:22:13.350
MEANING ISSUES AND I THINK FLUSH

04:22:13.417 --> 04:22:15.386
OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND

04:22:15.453 --> 04:22:16.320
INTERPRETATION BECAUSE IT'S

04:22:16.387 --> 04:22:19.190
ALWAYS EASIER TO THAT NOW BEFORE

04:22:19.256 --> 04:22:20.291
IT'S IN TRYING TO INS MA'AM Là

04:22:20.357 --> 04:22:21.025
HIDE I THINK THAT.

04:22:21.092 --> 04:22:21.959
THE FACT THAT THE OPPONENTS

04:22:22.026 --> 04:22:24.195
AGREE THAT THE UNDERLYING

04:22:24.261 --> 04:22:25.129
PURPOSE THE BILL.

04:22:25.196 --> 04:22:25.996
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY AGREE

04:22:26.063 --> 04:22:28.099
WITH IS A GOOD SIGN AND IT'S

04:22:28.165 --> 04:22:29.266
SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO AND I

04:22:29.333 --> 04:22:29.800
THINK THE POTENTIALS VERY

04:22:29.867 --> 04:22:30.835
STRONGLY.

04:22:30.901 --> 04:22:31.969
THAT IF WE AGREE ON THAT

04:22:32.036 --> 04:22:32.970
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT NOW WE'RE

04:22:33.037 --> 04:22:34.672
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE WORDS ON

04:22:34.738 --> 04:22:36.540
THE PAGE ARE WRITTEN AND WHAT

04:22:36.607 --> 04:22:38.075
THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE GOING AND I

04:22:38.142 --> 04:22:39.043
THINK THAT'S A LOT OF THE

04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:41.145
TENSION THAT YOU'RE HEARING IN

04:22:41.212 --> 04:22:43.681

THROUGHOUT THIS ALL THIS NOTION

04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:54.792
OF MAINTAINING STANDARDS.

04:22:54.859 --> 04:22:56.160
GETS DIFFICULT BECAUSE

04:22:56.227 --> 04:22:57.661
MAINTAINING FEDERAL STANDARDS

04:22:57.728 --> 04:22:58.796
VERSUS MAINTAINING STATE

04:22:58.863 --> 04:23:00.431
STANDARDS ARE NOT THE SAME. TO

04:23:00.498 --> 04:23:02.066
PUSH THINGS TO AN EMERGENCY

04:23:02.133 --> 04:23:03.801
REGULATION.

04:23:03.868 --> 04:23:05.903
REGULATORY PROCESS WHEN THERE'S

04:23:05.970 --> 04:23:07.438
NOT NECESSARILY AN EMERGENCY WE

04:23:07.505 --> 04:23:08.372
MAY THINK POLITICALLY THERE'S

04:23:08.439 --> 04:23:10.141
EMERGENCY THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY

04:23:10.207 --> 04:23:11.509
BE AN EMERGENCY.

04:23:11.575 --> 04:23:12.943
BUT FOR US THE LEVERAGE

04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:15.045
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS BYPASS

04:23:15.112 --> 04:23:17.181
SAYING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS

04:23:17.248 --> 04:23:17.715
GOING FORWARD WILL BE AN

04:23:17.781 --> 04:23:18.649
EMERGENCY.

04:23:18.716 --> 04:23:21.418
THROWS QUESTION INTO THOSE

04:23:21.485 --> 04:23:22.753
ASSUMPTIONS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

04:23:22.820 --> 04:23:24.188
TO BE WORKING OUT AND WE'RE

04:23:24.255 --> 04:23:25.856
GONNA HAVE AN EXPEDITED PROCESS.

04:23:25.923 --> 04:23:28.959
I'M FINE WITH THAT IN FACT IF.

04:23:29.026 --> 04:23:31.295
WE END UP EXPANDING [inaudible]

04:23:31.362 --> 04:23:33.364
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTALISTS.

04:23:36.300 --> 04:23:37.301
ULTIMATELY.

04:23:37.368 --> 04:23:39.003
I AM FINE WITH THAT BUT USING

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:40.638
THESE MECHANISMS IS WHERE WE

04:23:40.704 --> 04:23:42.506
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT'S

04:23:42.573 --> 04:23:43.641
WHY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:23:43.707 --> 04:23:45.242
WERE VERY CLEAR.

04:23:45.309 --> 04:23:46.377
THAT WERE NOT.

04:23:46.443 --> 04:23:48.646
UNNECESSARILY TAKING THE PUBLIC

SIMPLY ADOPT A FEDERAL STANDARD.

04:23:56.287 --> 04:23:57.788
ISN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT

04:23:57.855 --> 04:23:59.490
BECAUSE THAT IS INCREASING A

04:23:59.557 --> 04:24:00.624
CALIFORNIA STANDRD.

04:24:00.691 --> 04:24:02.159

SOMETHING THAT WAS FEDERAL

04:24:03.060 --> 04:24:04.795
THAT'S WHERE WE GET INTO SOME OF

04:24:04.862 --> 04:24:06.864
THE DISTINCTIONS THAT I THINK

04:24:06.931 --> 04:24:09.266
ARE NOT THAT SIMPLE -- TO MAY

04:24:09.333 --> 04:24:10.568
