YEARS WHEN THIS BILL WAS PASSED

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.179
THAT THERE WAS A CAP ON THE

00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:56.514
GRANT PER RECIPIENT BY ANDERSON

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.616

NECESSARY SUPPORTS IN THE COST

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.565

SO THAT THE SUPPORT SO WE GET

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:18.336
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PERHAPS

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:20.405

THAT- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD-

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.363
THIS BILL ARM IS EXTENDED FROM

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.398
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:49.934
ACT THE APA. OUR WHICH ALLOWS

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:53.772
FOR PUBLIC INPUT AND SCRUTINY-

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.540
JUST KIND OF CURIOUS TO KNOW

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:58.243
WHY IT WAS EXCLUDED FROM THAT.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:05.250
TEMPERAMENT. SO IT SO I WANT TO

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:06.785

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:07.585

WITH THE URGENCY IT IS THERE-

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.827
AND IN PART- NOW MORE THAN EVER

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:17.495

AT THE EXEMPTION AND THEREFORE

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:24.969
THERE FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:27.672
WOULD THERE BE A SAFETY OR

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.040
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THESE FUNDS

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:35.046

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.693
WAS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY IN

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.227
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN WE

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:45.296

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.064
FIREFIGHTER BILL OF RIGHTS AS A

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.933
THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAREN BASS

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.535
WAS THE AUTHOR. AND THERE WERE

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.471
A LOT OF THINGS SAID ABOT WHY.

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:57.408
IT MIGHT NOT WORK BUT THOSE

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.976
HAVE PROVED TO BE WRONG AND-

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:01.712
OF. OUR WILL BY THEN HAD. A

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:04.081
CHARGE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EIGHT

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:05.416
YEARS AS RESOURCES SECRETARY.

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.284
AND I THINK IT WAS A VALUABLE

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:09.620
PART OF OUR LABOR RELATIONS OUR

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.722
PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.023
SURE FIREFIGHTERS WERE PUTTING

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.093
THEMSELVES FOR US. OUT FOR US

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.661
REALLY HAD THE RIGHTS TO DEFEND

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.430
THEMSELVES THE ISSUE WITH THIS

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:20.831
BILL WHICH IS GOING TO BE

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:23.000
INTERESTING OVER TIME. IS THAT

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.568
SINCE WE HAVE STARTED TO HAVE A

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:26.704
FIRE SEASON THAT NEVER ENDS.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.072
THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THESE

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.540
POSITIONS OF NINE MONTHS HAS

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.375
BEEN SUCH THAT THE FIRE SEASON

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.011
HAS STARTED TO. EXTEND PAST THE

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.679
TIME THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSEDLY

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.915
TEMPORARY WORKERS. AND SO I

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.550
THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY GOOD

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.785
MEASURE. BECAUSE IT STARTS TO

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.487
PUT IN PLACE THE RIGHTS AND THE

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:44.655
PROCEDURES FOR PEOPLE TO

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.423
OPERATE WHEN THEY START TO

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.826
BROUGHT UP AGAINST THAT. AND I

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.427
THINK WE WERE AS A GROUP OF

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.795
GOING TO HAVE A REAL DECISION

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.597
TO MAKE AT SOME POINT. ABOUT

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:54.798
WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE MORE

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.333
PERMANENT FIREFIGHTERS IN LIEU

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.835
OF SEASONAL WORKERS IF WE HAVE-

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.470
FIRE SEASON THAT JUST GOES

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.839
TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR. END AND

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.974

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.576
THIS IS A GOOD BILL I'M GONNA

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.011

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.663
POINT FOR WHY YOU SHOULD BE

CAN'T HELP MY BUT TRYING CALM

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:46.729
IT HERE IS THE AND OF PUT SOME

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.831
POINTS ON THIS THIS BILL IS

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.366
ABOUT AN INJUSTICE. AND

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:53.836
INJUSTICE IS SOMEBODY MAKES A

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.939
DECISION BASED ON WHAT CALPERS

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.741
TELLS THEM ABOUT WHETHER THEY

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:00.209
HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHERE WITH

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:02.611
ALL TO RETIRE AND THEY CAN LIVE

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:06.348
OFF OF THEIR RETIREMENT. A AND

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.450
A NUMBER OF YEARS IN- THIS IT'S

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:11.653
MUCH LOWER AND IT'S NOT JUST OF

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.788
THE FORTUNE SITUATION WHERE

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.456
THEY HAVE TO LIVE OFF OF MUCH

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.258
LESS THAN I THOUGHT THEY WERE

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:18.160
WHEN THEY RETIRED. THEY BACK

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.229
THE DIFFERENCE SETTING A TIME

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:23.165
DEADLINE JUST MEANS THAT IF

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.566
WITH THE DAVIS FIREFIGHTER

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.801
THERE WAS AN INJUSTICE AT FIVE

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.070
YEARS HE JUST MOVED IN JUSTICE

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:29.304
TO TWO YEARS OR ONE YEAR BUT AT

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.473
LEAST THE INJUSTICE. AND SO THE

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.210
QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO HERE AND

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:37.146
I THINK THAT. WHAT THIS BILL

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:39.348
DOES THIS BY PUTTING THE ONUS

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:44.319
ON THE EMPLOYER WHO IS THE. ONE

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:45.487
THAT DOES THE REPORTING. THE HI

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:47.489
TO IT'S GOING TO BE A MOTOR-

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.359
FOR CORRECT REPORT. THEY HAD A

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:53.796
RIGHT ED AND DEEP DOWN QUE.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.230
SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT THAT

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:57.599
TAKES A BIT SHARE OF. BUT A IS

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:01.136
HOW IT IS THREE. THAT THEN HOW

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:04.173
ARE CALPERS. THE TERM IT WE- TO

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:10.145
THE PROBLEM. ANY. BUT I SPENT

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:10.946
TWENTY FIVE AS A LAW GUY

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.148
EMPLOYEE IN THE COW SYSTEM. A

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:16.118
AND THINK I WAS. BY YOU FOR

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:16.885
FORTY OF THE TIME IN A MEMBER

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:19.454
OF THE U. AND I GOT. APPOINTED

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.523
PICK ME SOME RELEASE THAT DOES

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.827
NOT INCLUDE MAN BECAUSE WERE ON.

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.428
WE WERE AT THEIR MERCY AND IF

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:28.630
THEY MAKE IN THEIR THAT SHOULD

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:29.865
BE A TO EXACTLY THE SAME WAY

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:30.899

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:34.536
EXACT THE SAME WAY- EVEN THOUGH

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.071
THIS BILL THE- DO IT SO I THINK

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.807
THE BILL WAS THE RIGHT. NOW

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:40.442
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO A THE

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.511
