THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ASKED MY NAME IS MARIA EVAN RANKO I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL I'M ALSO A CO FOUNDER AND COUNSEL AT THE POLICING PROJECT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. I'M THE POLICING PROJECT WORKS WITH POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS TO PROMOTE A MORE EQUITABLE SHASTA AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO POLICING OUT WE'VE WORKS NOW IN MORE THAN A DOZEN JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING. NEW YORK CHICAGO NASHVILLE TO SANA AND HERE IN LOS ANGELES. I'M PARTICULAR RELEVANCE AT THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE ALSO DRAFTED MODEL STATE LEVEL LEGISLATION ON VARIOUS POLICING ISSUES INCLUDING THE SORTS OF ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS AND PRIOR HEARINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE- I'VE BEEN ASKED TODAY AT TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS. AT IN ORDER TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE DISCUSSION TO FOLLOW AT WHICH I ALSO REALLY EAGER TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER PANELS THE BALLOT. UNTIL THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS AT BASICALLY I'D GIVES OFFICERS ASSIGNED OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS MOSTLY HAVING TO DO WITH THE DISCIPLINARY. PROCESS AT SOAP BARS COURT PROVISIONS KICK IN WHENEVER AN OFFICER IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR MISCONDUCT- SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT. BASICALLY JUST CODIFY KIND OF TRADITIONAL DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS AT SUCH AS THE BASIC REQUIREMENT THAT OFFICERS HAVE NOTICED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD BEFORE DISCIPLINE CAN BE IMPOSED. IT'S POTENTIALLY IN A MUCH MORE BUT- SAT CONSTRAINTS MONTHS CON INVEST. THAT GO BEYOND WHAT OTHER SECTOR EMPLOYEE ENJOY AT LEAST AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. CALIFORNIA'S NOT ALONE IN HAVING A PEACE OFFICER'S BILL RATES AT THEIR CURRENTLY TWENTY STATES UP WITH THESE SORTS OF STATUTES. AT MARYLAND WHICH WAS IN FACT THE FIRST TO ENACT AT POLICE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT REPEALED ITS PROFESSION EARLIER THIS YEAR AT LEADING TWENTY OTHER STATES WITH THE SORTS OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. ON CALIFORNIA'S POMAR ABSENCE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND RESPONSE TO CHIU OVERLAPPING SETS OF CONCERNS. ABOUT THE FIRST WAS THE PERCEPTION AMONG pLINE OFFICERS THAT POLICE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THESE WERE OFTEN. ARBITRARY AND GROSSLY UNFAIR- SO OFFICERS ROUTINELY COMPLAINED THAT THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF DISCIPLINE. VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST OFFICERS. BUT WAS INSTEAD DRIVEN BY FAVORITISM MEDIA PRESSURE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WERE OUTSIDE OFFICERS CONTROL ON THE PERCEPTION WAS THAT SOME OFFICERS ACTED OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY BECAUSE THEY WORK WELL LIKED BY THEIR SUPERIORS. AND OTHERS WERE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IGNORED. OFFICERS ALSO EXPRESSED TREATMENT OF THAT CONCERN ABOUT THE TREATMENT AT DURING DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS. INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF WRAPS AND OTHER COURSE OF TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO GET OFFICERS TO CAN FAST. UNTIL POLL WAS DESIGNED IN PART TO ADDRESS THE SORTS OF CONCERNS BY HAVING SOME DEGREE OF PROCEDURAL FORMALITY TO THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. ENSURING THAT OFFICERS HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR DEFENSE. THERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VERY REAL CONCERNS AT THAT DROVE THE ENACTMENT PULL BAR. WHICH OUT RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY AFTER SYSTEM ON OFFICERS TO THIS DAY. I'M AT THE SAME TIME I THINK EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO RACK FORMALIZED DISCIPLINE PROCESS. WAS ALSO A CRISP TO. FOR GREATER POLICE ACCOUNT. AFTER THE CIVIL MOVEMENT IN THE NNETEEN SIXTIES AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THE RISE OF CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS AND THE PUSH FOR GREATER COMMUNITY CONTROL OVER THE POLICE. IN OTHER STATES WITH HOPE OUR STATUTES WE ACTUALLY SEE MUCH STRICTER LIMITS ON CIVILIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WHICH REALLY KIND OF BRINGS OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISTORY OF A BAR. CALIFORNIA'S POOR DOES NOT EXPRESSLY PRECLUDES CIVILIAN REVIEW- BUT THIS PUSH FOR HER KIND OF STRONGER PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS AND MORE FORMAL CONSTRAINTS ON POLICE DISCIPLINE I WAS NEVER THE LAST BIRD AT LEAST IN PART. BY A GREATER PUBLIC SCRUTINY OF POLICE. AND SO PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY ACT HEALTH PLEASE CALL OUR INCLUDES AND MAKES OF FAIRLY RUDIMENTARY PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS ALONG WITH A FEW PROVISIONS THAT POTENTIALLY MAKE IT HARDER TO HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE MISCONDUCT. AMONG THE PROVISIONS THAT ENSURE BASIC PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS ACT IS FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFICERS BE INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM PRIOR TO QUESTION- SO. THAT TAKE A REASON HOUR. IDEALLY WHILE IN OUR IS ON DUTY- AND REQUIRES THAT ALL HAVE AN OP. TO TAKE BREAKS DURING INTERROGATION TO ATTEND OUR PHYSICAL NEEDS. OCTOBER ALSO PROHIBITS AGENCIES FROM FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING OFFICERS TO SUBMIT TO A POLYGRAPH WHICH AGAIN IS A REASONABLE LIMITATION GIVEN THE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE SORTS EXAMS. PROVISIONS POTENTIALLY IMPOSE A MORE SERIOUS. DETAILS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT AN INVESTIGATION OF AN OFFICER BE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF ONE AGENCY LEARNS ALEXION'S CONDUCT. WHICH MEANS THAT AN OFFICER ME SOMETIMES GET A FREE PASS AGENCIES SLOW ACT I'M STATUTES OF LIMITATION FOR OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA ARE TYPICALLY CLOSER TO THREE YEARS WHICH ENSURES THAT AGENCIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INVESTIGATE ALL THE FACTS. WERE ALSO REQUIRES AGENCIES TO PROVIDE OFFICERS. WITH A TRANSCRIPT OF ANY PRIOR INTERROGATION OF THE OFFICER TO THE INCIDENT BEFORE AN OFFICER COULD BE QUESTIONED A SECOND TIME I'M THIS PROVISION AGAIN MAY MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES AN OFFICER STORY. THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF QUESTIONING WHICH IS OF COURSE THE TRADITIONAL. TECHNIQUE I'M. FINALLY AT. YES PROCEDURAL PUT CAN WHEN I AN OFFER IS BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT A PATTERN THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO DISCIPLINE I'M AT LEAST OF REYES CONCERN I. THE BECAUSE THIS COULD POTENTIALLY APPLY TO SUPERVISORY QUESTIONING IMMEDIATELY AFTER USE OF FORCE AND- THIS CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SUPERVISORS TO QUICKLY DEVELOP AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF WHAT IN FACT OCCURRED CONTROL FOR HIS POOL BAR LACKS NUMBER THE MORE TROUBLING PROVISIONS THAT HAVE DRAWN WIDESPREAD CRITICISM OF PULL BARS IN OTHER STATES AT SO MARYLAND'S LAW ENFORCEMENT BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH WAS RECENTLY REPEALED I'LL HAVE IT OFFICERS TO DELAY INTERROGATION FOR UP TO TEN DAYS. NO QUESTIONS ASKED AND THIS OBVIOUSLY I WAS A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING A QUICK ACCOUNTING ACTS. MARYLAND'S ATLEO BORE ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE PERSON INTERROGATING A POLICE OFFICER BE A SWORN OFFICER THEMSELVES WHICH ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDED ANY SORT OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT ENTITY FROM INVESTIGATING POLICE MISCONDUCT. AND MINNESOTA OUT WHERE I AM ACT HAS A PROVISION ITS- BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH BASICALLY PRECLUDES ANY SORT OF CIVILIAN PER VIEW AT BY PROHIBITING CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS FROM EITHER MAKING FINDINGS FACT AROUND POLICE MISCONDUCT. OR IMPOSING DISCIPLINE ON OFFICERS I'M FLORIDA'S AT. AT BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH AGAIN HAS DRAWN WIDESPREAD CRITICISM REQUIRES OFFICERS TO GET ACCESS TO THE COMPLAINT ALL WITNESS STATEMENTS ALL EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM BEFORE THEY CAN EVER BE QUESTIONED IN THE FIRST PLACE I'M AND THIS OF COURSE GIVES OFFICERS AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF LEEWAY AT TO CONSTRUCT THEIR VERSION OF EVENTS BASED ON WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE. REPORT TO SHOW I'M SO YOU KNOW AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AT WORST OTHER STEVE CALIFORNIA'S IS SOMEWHAT MORE NARROWLY TAILORED TO RIDLEY ADDRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND TO BALANCE OFFICERS INTERESTS AGAINST AGENCIES LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATIVE. NEEDS ON THE LAST POINT THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. WATER IS NOT THAT WE POTENTIAL OBSTACLE HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE AND ELIMINATING POTENTIAL PROVISIONS FROM HOME ARE NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO CEASE TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE STATE. COUNCIL IS AS WITH AT LEAST BILL OF RIGHTS WELL OF THE SAME PER ARE K&lt;c.cyan&gt; IN STATE AND&lt;/c&gt; CLAY PARK AGREEMENTS WE SEE. COLLECTIVE ARE AGREEMENT OFF IMPOSE MY STRICTER COMMITTEE ON THE DISK PROCESS THE EVEN NUMBER X. POLICE ARE. HELLO RIGHTS THANKS A LOT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IMPOSED WAITING PERIODS AN OFF CAN QUESTION. GIVE OFFICERS ACCESS TO ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM WERE PROHIBITED AND H SORT OF CIVILIAN REVIEW I'M ONLY DONE A CURSORY LOOK AT BUT IT LOOKS LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE AT LEAST SOME OF THE SORTS OF PROVISIONS HERE AND CBA'S IN CALIFORNIA OF THOSE HARD TO KNOW JUST HOW PREVALENT. THEY ARE. IN ABSENCE OF A STATE LEVEL CLUB WHERE THOUGH AT MIGHT EXPECT THAT THE SORTS OF PROVISIONS BUT START TO CROP UP WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF FREQUENCY. I'M AND SO SHOULD THIS COMMITTEE AT DECIDED TO PROPOSE AMENDING OR REPEALING POLLUTION AB PORTIONS OF BAR. MADE VICE WOULD BE TO APPROACH THE MATTER HOLISTICALLY AND TO ENSURE THAT THE SORTS OF PROVISIONS I CAN'T JUST COME INTO BEING ACT BACK THROUGH A LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THANKS SO MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. THANK SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED- MEMBERS ARE GONNA DO IS GONNA HAVE ALL THE PANELS SPEAKING THEY WERE GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS WE'VE ASKED ALL THE PANELS TO PLEASE. REMAIN ONLINE WITH US- INTO IT AFTER ALL THE PANELS HAVE COME COMPLETE THEIR TESTIMONIES THEIR PRESENTATION THEN WE WILL ASK FOR A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FROM AN ARRAY OF- THE PANELISTS- FROM MEMBERS- MOVING FORWARD AND SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE PLEASE STAND BY- MEMBERS WE INVITE YOU TO PLEASE WRITE YOUR QUESTIONS DOWN- AND SO WE CAN GO BACK AND REFER TO IT- AND ADDRESS IT WHOEVER YOU CHOOSE. NEXT THAT WE WANT TO WELCOME- CECIL RAMBO HE IS THE CHIEF OF L. A. X. POLICE. DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRISON TO WHO'S PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY WITH US- CHIEF RABBI YOU WITH US. BUT YES YES CHAIRMAN NOW CAN YOU CAN YOU GUYS HEARING WE CAN HEAR VERY WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US WE APPRECIATE IT. WE ASK THAT YOU TAKE TEN MINUTES IN THOSE TEN MINUTES IF YOU CAN PLEASE IN ADDITION CELL AND THEN COMMENCED TO- SHARING WITH US- YOUR THOUGHTS IN YOUR TESTIMONY. ON THE SUBJECT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU GUYS FOR HAVING ME ON- AND I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED UP IN THE FALL DELIVERY INSIDE I KNOW US FROM AND LIKE EACH. OTHER SO I'M I'M NOT A THIRDS CHEERS INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT- I SPENT THIRTY THREE OF THOSE YEARS IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT- I WAS ASSIGNED INTERNAL AFFAIRS TWICE AT TWO DIFFERENT RANKS. AS A SERGEANT AND LIEUTENANT- I AM CURRENTLY THE CHIEF OF THIS YEAR AGO LAX. POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AS A PROFESSOR. NOTED ONE THING I WANT TO ADD IS THAT. PROVISION WAS ALL. A SIGN INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN JERRY BROWN. AND ACTUALLY SOME BY THE- AT THE TIME- OPPOSED BY CHIEFS OF POLICE IRONICALLY BUT BACK TO IT- BUT I CAN TELL YOU AS A PRACTITIONER- AS AN INVESTIGATOR AS A SUPERVISOR OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATORS AND IN HOUSE A COMMAND OFFICER- I UNDERSTAND. CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGES THAT A POPE MARC- CAN LEAD FOR IT CAN HAVE FOR US IS CHIEFS OF POLICE- PEOPLE KIND OF MISUNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT- THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS IN THE ROLE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS ARE TO SIMPLY FIND THE FACTS- AND TO SEPARATE THE TRUTH FROM FICTION- AND- PUT OUT THE FACTS AS THEY MAY BE FOR THE- DENTIST. BODY THAT'S GOING TO BE DETERMINED AND DISCIPLINED- INDEED AS WE PROGRESSED OVER TIME- THERE'S OFTEN- DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY NINE BILLS SCHEDULED FOR INSTANCE OUR CONSISTENCY IN A TYPE OF DISCIPLINE- SO IF SOMEONE GETS DISCIPLINED FOR. LET'S SAY NON LTE TRAFFIC COLLISION AT A HIGH SPEED- YOU KNOW HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC COLLISION THAT THEY GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE THAT SOMEONE ELSE DID IT. FOR SIMILAR ON. OFFENSE- I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS A PRACTICE. BUT THERE ARE. TO INTERVIEW- OFFICER AND GAVE- WHEN YOU'RE DOING INVESTIGATIONS PARTICULARLY THE- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT USES OF FORCE OR SOMEONE HAS. PASSED AWAY AT THE HANDS OF AN OFFICER OR DEPUTY- DURING THE COURSE OF THE USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS- AND OFTEN HERE IN IN WHAT AS YOU GUYS KNOW HERE IN LOS ANGELES- THERE IS A- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT RESPOND. I HAD SIGNIFICANT USES OF FORCE HAS EXPANDED FROM JUST MERELY THE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATOR IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR BUT ALSO. THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW OR INSPECTOR GENERAL'S SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF FOLKS TO COME OUT- AND GATHER INFORMATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE- THESE PARTICULAR CASES- YOU KNOW. WITH THAT SAID I THINK THAT- AS A PROFESSOR MENTIONED- IF THE PANEL SHOULD DECIDE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO. REPEAL THIS- I THINK WE SHOULD BE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CAUTION OURSELVES BECAUSE- BARGAINING AND- YOU DON'T. A MORE USE- IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CAN ACTUALLY LEAD TO MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING- AND MORE CHALLENGES TO A DEAL. FOR SPENDING ESTIMATIONS- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW IF WE'RE TAKE A LOOK AT. HOBART TAKE A LOOK AT EACH SECTION- AND BE VERY VERY- CAUTIOUS ON THE AND- INTROSPECTIVE ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE- REVISE IT- OR MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE PERSON'S. RIGHTS BUT IN SHORT I BELIEVE THAT- IT'S A- IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECTION- ON BOTH SIDES I THINK IT HELPS IT HELPS- DEPARTMENTS UNDERSTAND. HOW TO ACT- PERFORM THEIR JOBS WITHIN CERTAIN BOUNDARIES WITHOUT BEING OFFICIOUS- AND- AT SOME POINT WE PROBABLY WILL TALK ABOUT LIFE PARTNERS. WHO IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY P. OFFICER WHO HAD COMMITTED A CREEK LACKED IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT COMPEL ANY COMPELLED STATEMENTS CANNOT BE USED- ENABLE MINISTRIES- I'M SORRY ANY COMPEL STATEMENT STATEMENTS CANNOT BE USED CRIMINALLY. SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BY BIFURCATING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AS OPPOSED TO ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION SO- BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT SO- YOU KNOW AS WE GET INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS I'M SURE- DATA STACK WE WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES- BUT- I WELCOME. IN ECONOMY AND IN. WELL PERHAPS INPUT AS MOVE FORWARD IN THIS HEARING TODAY THANK YOU.

VAN TASTIC GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE DAVID REPRESENTS- MR THE STACKING REPRESENTS A RANK AND FILE OFFICERS WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING AROUND POOL BAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- YOU'RE FREE TO BEGIN TO- IN ADDITION SELF AND ALSO PROVIDE- YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MY NAME IS DAVID MISTAKE ME I AM A- PUBLIC EMPLOYEE LABOR ATTORNEY MY PRACTICE SPECIALIZES IN. REPRESENTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS AND THEIR MEMBERS AND ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. FROM CONTRACT NEGOTIATION FOR PAY AND BENEFITS AFTER THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THAT INCLUDES PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY HERE TO TALK ABOUT. TODAY IF I COULD SHARE MY SCREEN MAKE GET SOME HELP ON DOING THIS I DO HAVE A POWER POINT PRESENTATION MISTER CHAIRMAN YES. YES WE CAN OKAY SO I WANTED TO. WHAT THE COMMITTEE- THROUGH THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IN P. O. B. R. AND PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR ITS PROVISIONS. AT COR THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS PROCEDURAL BILL OF RIGHTS ISRAELI A CODIFICATION OF. LONG STANDING. YOU CAN GET RIGHTS TO REPRESENT MEMBERS DURING THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND BEFORE I JUMP INTO DETAILS HERE I WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. THAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS DURING THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND IT IS AGAIN IT IS JUST BASIC PROCEDURAL REPRESENTATION RIGHTS IS. REALLY HALF OF IT AND THEN THE SECOND HALF IS A CODIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND ALL OF THESE RIGHTS ARE FOR THE MOST PART FOUND- AS A PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED. IN OTHER. IN OTHER ASPECTS OF CASE LAW AND IN OTHER STATUTES THE REMAINDER IS A BUNCH OF MISCELLANEOUS RIGHTS ARE REALLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED OVER THE TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE CORRECTED LIKE AN OFFICER NOT BEING ALLOWED TO WEAR AN AMERICAN FLAG PAN OR AN OFFICE OR NOT BEING ALLOWED TO RUN FOR SCHOOL BOARD. POSITION OR- FORCED TO TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST. THE KEY THING THOUGH THAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT NONE OF THESE RIGHTS APPLY TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION NONE OF THEM ARE IN ANYWAY. AN ENCUMBRANCE ON HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE OPTIMALLY MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY BUT- YOU KNOW NONE OF THESE THINGS APPLY IF AN OFFICERS ACCUSED OF EXCESSIVE FORCE AND THERE'S A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION% OR SEXUAL ASSAULT. THAT'S A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE OFFICERS TREATED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CRIMINAL SUSPECT THESE ONLY APPLY DURING THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND WE'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING ABOUT- PROCEDURAL RIGHTS SO JUMPING RIGHT IN I KNOW MY TIME IS LIMITED HERE. TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS. THE GRAVEL NONE OF THAT PROTECTIONS UNDER THAT PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS IS BASIC INFORMATION THAT ANY OTHER UNION MEMBER RECEIVES AND ANY KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INVESTIGATION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONDUCTING IT. OUR REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A REPRESENTATIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAPE RECORDED THE RIGHT NOT TO BE HARASSED THREATENED OR COERCED. AND I WANT TO JUST OPPOSE THIS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE STATUTES. STARTING WITH I THE NLRB WHICH ACTUALLY DOESN'T APPLY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALL OF THE STATE LABOR STATUTES. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WERE MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN SOME OF THE RIGHT TO WORK STATES. DODD THE NLRB ONLY A PRICE APPLIES TO PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES BUT UNDER THE FAMOUS CASE OF WINE GARDEN IT HELD THAT. UNION MEMBERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY THEIR UNION WHEN THEY'RE SUBJECT TO AN INVESTIGATION THAT COULD LEAD TO DISAPPOINT. THE COURTS AND CURB IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXTENDED THOSE SAME WEINGARTEN RIGHTS TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA- FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE MMDA. THIRTY FIVE OH TWO IS THAT RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED IN THIRTY FIVE OH THREE IS THAT RIGHT FOR A UNION TO REPRESENT ITS MEMBERS AND PURPOSE HELD THAT THAT. PROVIDES S. SIMILAR AND IN SOME WAYS MORE EXPANSIVE RIGHT THEN THESE PROCEDURAL RIGHTS IN THIRTY THREE OH THREE OF THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS. SO I LOOKING AT THESE WEINGARTEN RIGHTS SOME OF THE CONCERNS- YOU KNOW THAT AN OFFICER CAN DELAY IN INVESTIGATION OR SIMPLY NOT TRUE THE OFFICER DOES NOT HAVE AN ABILITY TO DO THAT THE COURTS HAVE SAID. THAT THE OFFICER CAN BE GIVEN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WHICH IS DAYS NOT WEEKS TO OBTAIN A REPRESENTATIVE THE EMPLOYER. CONTROLS IN PLACE DIFFERENT THAN A CIVIL CASE BECAUSE IT YOUR EMPLOYEES SO YOU CAN ORDER THEM TO CALM MAN ON DUTY AT ANY TIME AND PROVIDE A STATEMENT. AND IN FACT ON CASES OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT'S DONE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OR WITHIN DAYS OF THE ACCUSATIONS COMING FORWARD. THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS IT'S ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL IN THIS REGARD THE WINE GARDEN RIGHT IT'S BROADER. BECAUSE THE OUR BILL OF RIGHTS PERTAINS TO WIN THE EMPLOYER THINKS THE QUESTIONING COULD LEAD TO DISCIPLINE. THE WEINGARTEN RIGHT IS WHEN THE EMPLOYEE THINKS IT COULD LEAD TO DISCIPLINE WHICH IS ACTUALLY UNDER THE LABOR LAWS EMPLOYEE CAN STE SAY I WANT TO REPRESENTATIVES- IN ALMOST ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN PROBE HAS TAKEN IT EVEN FURTHER AND THEY'VE EXPRESSLY HELD THAT THE RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA AS IN MY OPINION THEY SHOULD BE. OUR BROADER AND MORE EXPANSIVE THAN THAT THE FEDERAL MINIMUM STANDARDS AND SO UNIONS HAVE A RIGHT TO REPRESENT THEIR MEMBERS AND BASICALLY BE PRESENT- ANYTIME THAT THEY'RE BEING I JUST HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT PERFORMANCE ISSUES FITNESS FOR DUTY EVALUATIONS MEDICAL ISSUES- DRUG TESTING. EVEN NIGHT CANCELING ON PERFORMANCE. I SAW ONE AND ALSO TALK ABOUT THAT THE NOTICE RIGHTS AND SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE NOTICE IS VERY VERY MINIMAL IT'S BASICALLY I'M NOT. OF THAT FACTUAL SUMMARY LIKE I'M TALKING A COUPLE OF SENTENCES SO THAT THE OFFICER KNOWS WHAT THE INTERROGATION IS GONNA BE ABOUT THAT'S TO THE BENEFIT OF EVERYBODY. IF YOU CALL AN OFFICER RAN AND SAY THEY RECEIVED THAT THE AGENCY RECEIVED A COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED SIX MONTHS EARLIER ON I YOU KNOW BEING RUDE AND DISCOURTEOUS ON A TRAFFIC STOP. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE NO IDEA AND THE RESPONSES ARE GOING TO BE I DON'T REMEMBER. IN LESS THE OFFICERS TOLD IN ADVANCE AND HAS A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT IT SO THAT THEY CAN RECALL THAT EVENT AND THEN TESTIFY TRUTHFULLY ABOUT IT. AT BUT THERE'S A SUPREME COURT CASE SAYS YOU'RE NOT ENTITLED TO A COPY OF THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION THEY'RE NOT EVEN AND TITLE TO A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM IT'S JUST. BASIC INFORMATION LIKE YOUR ACCUSED OF EXCESSIVE FORCE DURING THIS. CALL THAT FOR SERVICE THAT YOU HAD ON SUCH AND SUCH A DATE SO THEY KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT. WINE GARDEN. AND THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAVE ACTUALLY GONE EVEN FURTHER THAN JUST NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND THEY SAID THAT AS- UNION REPRESENTATIVE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SECURE INFORMATION REGARDING THE SUBJECT MATTER- AND A PRE INTERVIEW CONFERENCE WITH THE UNION REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENT BUT THEY MAKE CLEAR THAT IT'S ENOUGH. SO THAT. THE ACCUSED EMPLOYEE CAN TALK TO THEIR UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND I KNOW WHAT THE SUBJECT MATTER IS GOING TO BE. AND THEY CAN PREPARE. THERE IS A CASE DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM. ALLEN'S VERSUS SIERRA MADRE AND IN THIS CASE THE COURT WAS. LOOKING AT THE RIGHTS UNDER P. O. B. R. AND THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE PARALLEL. TO SPECIFICALLY THAT PACIFIC TELEPHONE CASE AND TWO OTHER. UNION RIGHTS IMPORTANTLY IN THAT CASE. I THEY THEY OFFICER AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE GIVEN ENOUGH ADVANCE NOTICE AND THE COURT SAID IT WAS SUFFICIENT. UNDER THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT. WILL NAY OFFICER AND HIS REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED THAT THEY WERE GIVEN TIME TO TALK AND THEN GIVE THE STATEMENT THAT SAME DAY I THINK IT REALLY DRIVES HOME THE POINT. THAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT DELAY OR IMPEDE THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION- I CHIEF RAMBO HAD MENTIONED THE RIGHT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION AND I WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON THIS TOO AND REMIND EVERYBODY THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN A FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION AND THE IMPORTANT PUBLIC INTEREST IN KNOWING WHAT ITS OFFICERS ARE DOING OFFICERS ARE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHER EMPLOYEES THERE SUBJECT EIGHT THIRTY TO AT SAC OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH MANDATES A PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS AND EVEN INTERNAL COMPLAINTS. AND MY CLIENTS UNDERSTAND THAT PARTICULARLY IN THESE TIMES THESE ARE IMPORTANT CONFIDENCE- BUT YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THE RIGHT AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION AND THIS IS ONLY IN THE DISCIPLINARY SPEAR BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NORMAL CRIMINAL DEFENDANT THEY WOULD JUST INVOKE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT AND SAY. NOTHING AND SO THAT BALANCES LIVE ORDER WHERE THE OFFICER IS COMPELLED TO GIVE A STATEMENT. AND THAT STATEMENT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF DISCIPLINE UP TO TERMINATION THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY STILL COME INTO COURT. THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A MUCH STRONGER PROTECTION THEY CAN ONLY BE INTERROGATED REGARDING MATTERS THAT HAVE CRIMINAL CONNOTATION IF THERE'S A WRITTEN GRANTED IMMUNITY. OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES- ARE ESSENTIALLY. SUBJECT TO THE SAME Y. BARBARA RULED THERE WAS A CASE CALLED SPIEL BAUER THAT CLARIFIED THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE PROSECUTING AGENCY OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN ORDER TO COMPILE AN EMPLOYEE TO GIVE A STATEMENT. EVEN IF IT INVOLVES POTENTIAL CRIMINAL MATTER SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT OFFICERS CAN'T JUST INVOKE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT AND REFUSED TO GIVE A STATEMENT REGARDING ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ANY OF THOSE. SERIOUS MATTERS. WHEN WE TURN TO THE DISCIPLINARY APPEAL. HEARING THE BILL OF RIGHTS DOES VERY LITTLE ACTUALLY THE RIGHT TO APPEAL DISCIPLINE FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SKELLY DECISION AND IT'S A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. EMPLOYEES HAVE A FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT THIS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES I SHOULD SAY HAVE A FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT. TO THEIR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AND THEY HAVE A FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS RIGHT BEFORE THAT CAN BE DEPRIVED. AND SO I THINK EVERYBODY REMEMBERS STALEY IT HAS TWO PARTS GIVE A QUICK REFRESHER ON IT THE FIRST IS PRE DEPRIVATION MEANING BEFORE THE DISCIPLINE IS IMPOSED. THE EMPLOYEE HAS A RIGHT TO A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND TO RESPOND NOT IN THAT EVIDENCE REYES BUT JUST TO MEET AND RESPOND AND EXPLAIN. IF THEY DISCIPLINE IS IMPOSED THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THE DENTURES HEARING APPEALING THAT. THESE RIGHTS ARE NOT IN P. O. B. R. AND THEY ARE. EXISTING REGARDLESS OF P. O. B. R. ALL THAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS SAYS IS THAT NO PUNITIVE ACTION CAN BE IMPOSED WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL JUST A RESTATEMENT OF THE EXISTING LAW. IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES SHALL SET THE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR APPEAL THAT'S YOUR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM THAT ALSO EXISTS IN THIS IS JUST A RESTATEMENT OF THE EXISTING LAW. THE BILL OF RIGHTS PROVIDES A RIGHT OF ACCESS TO ADVERSE COMMENTS AND TO PERSONNEL FILES THAT CAN BE USED TO DISCIPLINE EXPRESSLY. THERE ARE OTHER STATUTES THAT APPLY TO NON SWORN EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A PRETTY STANDARD RIGHT- YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM ALL RIGHT TO WORK STATE. THAT ANY EMPLOYEE WHETHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC IN CALIFORNIA HAS. THE FIREFIGHTER BILL OF RIGHTS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT. IT ACTUALLY SPECIFIES WHAT THE APPEAL PROCEDURES ARE AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE ROBUST IT MANDATES EITHER OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT OR BINDING ARBITRATION- WITH RESPECT TO PEACE OFFICERS. IT RUNS THE GAMUT I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY IS A CIVIL SERVICE BOARD THAT'S VESTED WITH HEARING THESE APPEALS THERE ARE CITIZENS APPOINTED BY. ELECTED OFFICIALS SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE ARBITRATION BUT THAT'S THE MINORITY I SOME HAVE CITY MANAGER OR CITY COUNCIL REVIEW OF THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS- BUT THERE IS- AS A PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED. I A WIDE AVAILABILITY FOR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AND THAT DOES IN FACT EXIST WITHIN THE APPEAL PROCESS ITSELF AS WELL AS- IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THEIR CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS AND OTHER MEASURES AND I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT. THAT AS PART OF THIS MOMENT IN REFLECTING ON POLICE REFORM MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING WITH THE LEADERSHIP TO ENACT STATEWIDE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS TO REFORM USE OF FORCE POLICIES TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AND ALSO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF OFFICERS WHO COMMIT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WHILE STILL AFFORDING THEM DUE PROCESS RIGHTS- I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STATUE LIMITATIONS I UNDERSTAND- FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKER THAT THERE WAS SOME CONCERN. ARE THERE SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER HERE THE STATUTE RUNS FROM THE DISCOVERY OF A PERSON AUTHORIZED TO INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION JUMPING MY SLIDES HERE A LITTLE BIT BUT THERE IS A THREE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT GENERALLY APPLIES THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT THREE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATION- I THINK. IT'S RIGHT HERE AB IT RUNS FROM THE DATE OF OCCURRENCE SO IF NOBODY FINDS OUT ABOUT SOME MISCONDUCT AND THREE THERE'S A LOT. DAY IT'S TIME FOR THAT DOESN'T APPLY. TWO PEACE OFFICERS IT'S A YEAR FROM WHEN SOMEBODY WHO IS AUTHORIZED TO START AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION FINDS OUT ABOUT IT I CAN TELL YOU DOING THIS TWENTY TWO YEARS IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE THE CASE THAT A SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ALLEGATION TIME BARS OUT- WHERE IT COMES INTO PLAY IS REALLY MINOR STUFF. THAT IS LIKE OUTSIDE SHOWING UP THE ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED MY CAREER WEBSITE TRAFFIC COLLISION THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LETTER OF REPRIMAND OR A DAY OFF AT THE MOST AND THE AGENCY BOB. WAITED A YEAR TO DO IT AND THEY BLEW THE DAY WHICH THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAITING A YEAR BUT BEYOND THAT THERE ARE A TON OF EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO APPLY TO ALMOST EVERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ALLEGATION. AND ACTUALLY- MOST ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AGAINST AN OFFICER IF THERE'S A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF THE OFFICER AT THE IME IS TOLD IF THERE'S A CRIMINAL LAW. THE PROSECUTION OF THE COMPLAINT THE TIME IS TOLD IF THERE'S MULTI JURISDICTIONS MEANING YOU KNOW WHAT CITY POLICE OFFICER AND A DEPUTY SHERIFF IT'S TOLD IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OFFICER INVOLVED. IT'S TOLD IF THE OFFICER IS UNAVAILABLE FEES ON WORK COMP IF HE'S ON VACATION IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. ARE THEY THE TIME LIMITS TOLD SOLD FOR ALLEGATIONS A WORK COMP FRAUD. AND IT'S ALSO TOLD WHERE THEIR CIVIL LITIGATION AND THE OFFICER IS A DEFENDANT AND BEYOND ALL OF THAT. THERE'S AN ABILITY OF THE AGENCY TO RE OPEN THE INVESTIGATION. IF THERE'S- IF THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE. THAT FIREFIGHTER BILL OF RIGHTS HAS A SIMILAR STATUTE THERE'S ALSO A CIVILIAN STATUTES FOR CIVILIAN POLICE EMPLOYEES IN THE MMDA- THAT'S THE SAME AND THEN. YOU ALSO HAVE EVEN SOME SHORTER TIME LIMITS IN OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE AND PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. I WOULD SUBMIT. TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG PUBLIC INTEREST AND MAINTAINING TIME LIMITATIONS ON DISCIPLINE. THE ENTIRE POINT OF DISCIPLINE IS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND CORRECT BEHAVIOR SO YOU HAVE TO PUT AN EMPLOYEE ON NOTICE THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS DEFICIENT. AND THEN CORRECTED NOW AGAIN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE A USE OF FORCE OR AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IN THOSE CASES THE OFFICERS PUT ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE AND- INTERVIEWED WITHIN A WEEK OR SO OF THAT HAPPENING NOW TO BE FAIR THE AGENCY'S GONNA WANT INTERVIEW THE OTHER WITNESSES FIRST. BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE AN OFFICER WORKING FOR A YEAR OR MORE THAN A YEAR WITHOUT CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION AND IF THEY WERE SO INCLINED IT WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. TO PUT A TIME LIMITATION ON THAT TO FORCE THEM TO CONDUCT A TIMELY INVESTIGATION AND IF THAT OFFICER COMMITTED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT REMOVE THEM FROM THE FORCE IF THEY DIDN'T THEN CLARA PUT HIM BACK TO WORK SO YOU'RE OR JUST LEAVING IT HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS WHERE THE TIME LIMITATIONS. TYPICALLY WOULD COME INTO PLAY IS ON MINOR ISSUES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE A DETECTIVE WHO IS WRITING VERY GOOD REPORTS ARE CONDUCTING THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST WOULD STRONGLY IN MY VIEW BE IN FAVOR OF TIMELY CORRECTING THAT. RATHER THAN ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT DEFICIENT INVESTIGATIONS FOR A YEAR BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION ARE MORE THAN A YEAR. BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION- IT DOES NOT IMPEDE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS OR THE COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION AS I MENTIONED AGENCIES PRIORITIZE THE MORE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THEY CAN ORDER AN OFFICER TO COME IN AND PROVIDE A STATEMENT AT ANY TIME. THE OFFICER CANNOT DELAY THAT THE ON MAYBE A FEW DAYS AT MOST IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A REPRESENTATIVES AND MANY TIMES IN MY PRACTICE. THE OFFICERS BEEN ORDERED TO COME IN AND GIVE A STATEMENT IMMEDIATELY ON SERIOUS MISCONDUCT- ON CRITICAL INCIDENTS ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THEIR UNION FACILITATES GETTING AN ATTORNEY YOU'RE GETTING A REPRESENTATIVE. FOR THEM. IMMEDIATELY AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT ANOTHER RISK OF NOT HAVING A TIME LIMIT AND THIS ONE MAY BE IT'S A LITTLE CLOSE TO HOME I PERSONALLY REPRESENTED AT MICHAEL'S ECKLER WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT MANAGERS ASSOCIATION THE TIME THAT I ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER WAS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF BACK IN IRAN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN OR SO AND MR ZIGLAR WAS SUBJECT TO AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION FOR BRINGING DISREPUTE ON THAT SACRAMENTO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BY FILING A GRIEVANCE IN INVESTIGATING A GRIEVANCE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF THAT WAS THE PLACE HIM ON A GAG ORDER INDEFINITELY AND WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO COURT AND GET THAT LISTED AND HAVE HIS NAME CLEARED BUT THERE IS A RISK OF MISUSE AND ABUSE IF THERE'S NOT A TIME LIMIT SO THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE RESOLVED- ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND JUST. IN CLOSING. WANT TO KNOW TO THE COMMITTEE THAT VIRTUALLY ALL STATES HAVE STATUTES ESTABLISHING- SIMILAR TYPE PROCEDURES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS CALLED THE BILL OF RIGHTS THIRD CONTAINED IN. OTHER STATUTES AND CASE LAW AND OTHER NAMES ARE BUT THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S BILL OF RIGHTS ARE AT THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE AS THE PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED I AGREE WITH THAT THEY ARE THEIR BASIC UNION RIGHTS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I THERE ARE FOURTEEN OR ALL RIGHT I THINK ACTUALLY THAT NUMBERS INCREASED TO SEVENTEEN STATES THAT HAVE EXPRESSED BILL OF RIGHTS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT WITH ILLINOIS' AND MARYLAND. THERE HAS BEEN SOME MISS MISLEADING OR CONFUSING REPORTING ON WHAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE ON THAT SO CALLED REPEALING THE BILL OF RIGHTS BOTH STATES STILL HAVE A BILL OF RIGHTS FOR OFFICERS THERE WERE AMENDMENTS STEIN. AND IF YOU IF YOU DIG DEEPER AND LOOK AT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY DONE THEY WEREN'T REALLY CHANGES TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS THEY WERE AND ACTIONS- REFORMS IN NATIONAL REFORMS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO AB THREE NINETY TWO WHICH I WAS INVOLVED IN SB TWO THIRTY WHICH I WAS INVOLVED AND FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND- MSP AT FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND SIXTEEN WHICH DEALT WITH TRANSPARENCY. SO ILLINOIS' WHAT THEY DID IS THEY ENACTED USE OF FORCE CHANGES THEY ENACTED BODY CAMERA MANDATES AND THEY STRENGTHENED DE CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT. WE DID IN CALIFORNIA WITH SB TWO MARYLAND VERY SIMILAR THEY INCREASE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY THEY MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS THEY IMPLEMENTED STATE WIDE USE OF FOR STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENT TO HAVE BODY CAMERAS BY. JULY OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE NEW YORKNEVER HAD AN EXPRESS BILL OF RIGHTS BUT THEY HAVE SIMILAR RIGHTS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND OTHER LABOR STATUTES AND THAT THE BIG CHANGE WITH OUR REFORM IN NEW YORK. WAS- THE DISCLOSURE. OF DISCIPLINARY RECORDS TO WE DID AND CAL. AND NOT JUST IN CLOSING IF THE COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING AT MAKING CHANGES WHAT I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND IS CODIFYING THESE BASIC UNION RIGHTS THIS IS A UNION STATE FOR ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES I KNOW THAT THERE WAS LEGISLATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE CONSIDER DOING THAT I'M NOT SURE WHY. IT DIDN'T PASS I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IT WOULD MAKE A LOT IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FIND YOU THESE VARIOUS RIGHTS THROUGH- PER DECISIONS IN CASE LAW- TO PUT THEM RIGHT INTO OUR INTO OUR LABOR STATUTES AND SHOW THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. HOW TO TAKE CARE OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. MISTER STAGNANT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR GOING IN DEPTH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- ALLOWED YOU TO GO OVER- YOUR TIME ALLOTTED BECAUSE I THINK THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SO AGAIN PLEASE STAND BY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I'VE TAKEN SOME NOTES I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES- HAS ALSO TAKEN THE NOTE THAT WE WANT TO ASK YOU YOU RAISE A NUMBER OF A PARTICULAR- QUESTIONS FOR US IN OUR MINDS WE WANT TO BE TO GET TO YOU SO PLEASE STAND BY. AT THE TIME WILL ALLOW IF YOU IF IT DOESN'T ALLOW PLEASE LET US KNOW AND WE'LL TRY TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN ARGENTA WE ALSO ARE AGAIN HAPPY TO HAVE ON THE LINE. MISTER MARK- HARRIS CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY WITH THEY'VE BEEN CROP LAW- WITH THIS VIRTUALLY- MISTER HARRIS I USED ARE YOU WITH THIS NOW. ABSOLUTELY ARE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM DOING EXTREMELY WELL THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US- AND PROVIDING YOUR TESTIMONY- THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF THOSE WHO ALREADY TESTIFIED PREMADE PRESENTATIONS AND SO WE WANT TO- YIELD THE FLOOR TO YOU AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME TO GET REPRESENTATION- AS WELL SO PLEASE INITIATE AND- COMMITTED YOUR PRESENTATION. I THAT MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IT'S A REAL HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE. BUT LET ME FIRST THANK YOU FOR GRANTING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO JOIN YOU- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC OF COURSE FOR THE NTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SUB TEXT OF TODAY'S EXPLORATION FOR THIS PANEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE INVESTIGATING MISCONDUCT IN PRACTICE. INVESTIGATING MISCONDUCT IN PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHERE MY- COMMENTS AND REMARKS ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSED. WE'VE HEARD SOME GREAT SPEAKERS SO FAR TALK ABOUT. THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS NOT EVERY ELEMENT OF IT. IS WRONG AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION IS AN ATTORNEY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. NOT EVERY ASPECT OF IT IS RIGHT- OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS DID A GREAT JOB OF POINTING OUT SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE ARE APPROPRIATE SO I WOULD JUST COMMEND THEM FOR THAT. I WANT TO BRING GREETINGS FROM MY LAW PARTNER. ATTORNEY BEN CRUMP WE'RE HEADQUARTERED IN TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA I'M THE MANAGING ATTORNEY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I SPLIT MY TIME BETWEEN HERE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SPECIFICALLY THE CITY OF MERCED- OUR LAW FIRM HAS A LONG HISTORY. IN REPRESENTING THE VOICELESS IN REPRESENTING THOSE WHO MANY TIMES ARE. OFFERED GOTTEN- A DISENFRANCHISED DISRESPECTED. WE REPRESENT THE FAMILIES OF COURSE OF TRAYVON MARTIN AND GEORGE FLOYD. OF BRIANNA TAYLOR ANAMAT ARBURY. AND IN HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE REPRESENTED THE FAMILY OF STEPHON CLARK- I STILL COUNT HIS BROTHERS THE BRONTE IS BOTH A FRIEND. AND SOMEONE WHO ACT CONNECT WITH ON MANY ASPECTS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CIVIL RIGHTS SO. WE'VE HAD TO- THE IN AMAZING RUN OVER THESE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF REALLY EXPLORING. THE ISSUES AT THE CORE OF THIS PROCESS I REALLY WANT TO JUST IF I CAN. ASK IN YOUR- TO GO WITH. TO JUST AN ASPECT OF THIS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT- IN SOME MANNER OR ANOTHER ARE TRUE BOTH FACTUALLY AND IN PRACTICE. BUT YOU KNOW I'M I'M OLD SCHOOL WHEN I'M FROM SOUTH CENTRAL LA MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SHARED WITH ME AS A YOUNGSTER GROWING UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL I STILL- USING A BRACE AND ONE OF THEM WAS THE PREMISE THAT JUNK IN. RESULTS AND JUMP OUT. WHAT WE WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSING ON IN MY OPINION IS THE PART OF THIS PUZZLE THAT IT RARELY GETS THE SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF THE TICKET ATTENTION. THAT'S THE INTAKE PROCESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON. HAS A LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT AGAINST A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL OR OFFICIALS WHERE DOES THAT GO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. IN REAL TERMS LIMIT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IF I MAY JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE SPACE. IN THE VERY BUILDING IN WHICH YOU SAID. I WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE BEEN CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY INTRODUCED JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE AUDIBLE ELIHU M. HARRIS- I SERVED UNDER BOTH GVERNOR GRAY DAVIS. AS THE UNDERSECRETARY BUSINESS TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING I HAD OVERSIGHT AT THE TIME OUR DEPARTMENT HAD OVERSIGHT OVER THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL- I ALSO SERVED IN THAT BUILDING AS AN APPOINTEE OF THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN NG BROWN JUNIOR. AND I WAS AN APPOINTEE TO THIS FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING COUNCIL SO I'VE HAD AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY RELATIVE TO STATE GOVERNMENT POLICY. ON A LOCAL LEVEL I HAVE SERVED AS A POLICE. REVIEW COMMISSIONER OR BOARD MEMBER DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS YOUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER JUST ACKNOWLEDGE. HAS. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REALLY THE AXE YOU'LL DISCIPLINE BETTER OFFICER MAKES THE- WERE. PROCESS IS REALLY TWO STEPS IT'S THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SOME OF WHICH HAVE SUBPOENA POWER SOME OF WHICH YOU DON'T- AND THEN THEY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION OF COURSE TO A CIVIL SERVICE BOARD- WHICH THEN DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE DISCIPLINE- THAT THE OFFICER FACES SO I SERVED IN BOTH OF THOSE ROLES. AND I'VE ALSO SERVED IN MY UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED ON THE POLICE ADVISORY COMMISSION THERE SO. I'VE LOOKED AT THIS NOT ONLY AS A LAWYER ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS BUT AS A POLICY MAKER AS A PERSON WHO REALLY HAS TRIED AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL TO GET A HANDLE ON A NUMBER OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES. I WILL SAY THAT- ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES YOUR SENATE COLLEAGUES. WHO REPRESENTS- VALLEJO HAD A TOWN HALL MEETING A FEW WEEKS AGO HAD SENATOR BRADFORD ANOTHER'S EXPLAINING SB TWO I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REALLY WELL DONE. ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS THE DEAN OF THE UC DAVIS MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR SCHOOL OF LAW- KEVIN JOHNSON AND KEVIN JOHNSON SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY ON POIN HERE WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THESE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLICE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS. AND GIVING- IF YOU CAN SOME CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE PROCESS OF DISCIPLINING OFFICERS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED BY LAWYERS AND JUDGES. IF THEY'RE TO BE SOLVED HERE TO BE SOLVED BY POLICY MAKERS AND THAT'S WHY WOULD YOU IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE YOUR DOING. IS SO VERY VERY IMPORTANT. MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. HOW TO MAKE THIS BETTER I WANT TO JUST KIND OF TAKE A STEP BY STEP APPROACH TO SOME OF THIS AND AT THE END OF MY REMARKS I'M GOING TO MAKE THREE HOPEFULLY TANGIBLE AND CREDIBLE. A RECOMMENDATION SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO I WAS FRUSTRATED IS MANY OF US WERE OVER THE MURDER AS- WE SAW BE. CHILLING WE FELT UNJUSTIFIED OF AN INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED GENTLEMAN IN THE DEL PASO HEIGHTS SECTION OF SACRAMENTO HIS NAME JOSEPH MAN WE'VE HEARD ABOUT STEPHON CLARK THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW STEPHON CLARK NOW. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS GEORGE FLOYD'S NAME VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OF MR MAN'S NAME HIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS HE WAS BABBLING INCOHERENTLY. IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOWED UP AT THE REPORT OF A POSSIBLE HIDDEN KNIFE IN THE HAND OF MR MAN. AND IN FEWER THAN THIRTY SECONDS THE OFFICERS ON THE SCENE TRIED TO RAM HIM WITH THEIR KERR LEFT FOOT LEAPT FROM THEIR VEHICLE IN A FUSE A LOT OF BULLETS TOOK HIS LIFE. HE WAS UNARMED AS IT TURNED OUT THAT IN TWENTY SIX SIXTEEN MADE ME REALLY THINK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT I'M PLAYING IN THIS PROCESS AND I SAID YOU KNOW. THESE PROBLEMS REALLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE FIXED BY LAWYERS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE LAWYERS WHO ARE HERE ASSEMBLED. THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIXED HOPEFULLY BY THE PEOPLE. SO WHAT I DID ALONG WITH TWO COLLEAGUES IS FORMED A NEW GROUP HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT GOES BY THE ACRONYM LEAD L. E. A. D. AND LEAD STANDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY DIRECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD LEAD WHAT WE COULD DO IS SET UP AN NGO THAT WOULD GIVE THEM A VOICE TO THE VOICELESS AND WE'LL GO THE FIRST. ACCOMPLISHMENTS. OF LEAD. WHAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS OF SAN. THE POLICY REGARD- UP CAMERAS WOULD CHANGE BOTH PAST CAMERAS AND BODY CAMERAS THIS WAS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TOOK ITS ACTION THROUGH THE WEBER LEGISLATION. WE WERE AMONG THE FIRST YEAR RESTRICTIONS IN THE STATE TO HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT AUDIO AND VIDEO- TRANSMISSIONS IF AVAILABLE WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT EVERY SITUATION HAVE THEM AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THERE ALL KINDS OF REASONS. WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL LEGITIMATELY DISENGAGE THEIR CAMERAS BUT IF AVAILABLE WE GOT A LOCAL ORDINANCE PASSED YEAR THAT REQUIRE THEY BE URNED OVER WITHIN THIRTY DAYS THAT WAS HUMONGOUS AND THAT CAME AS A RESULT- SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT CAME FORWARD TO OUR OFFICE AND OTHERS. OF PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY WERE MISTREATED BY POLICE BUT THERE WAS NO AUDIO OR VIDEO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE SO THAT THEN OF COURSE ON A STATE LEVEL GOT LIFTED TO WHERE WE HAVE IT NOW AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT. MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE FROM MY COMMUNITY AND I LIVE IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO THE DOMINANT ETHNICITY- IF YOU WILL IS- MULTI. ETHNIC WE HAVE API WE HAVE LATINO- WE HAVE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WE HAVE CAUCASIANS WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE MALL COMMUNITY WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHO SETTLED IN THIS PART OF SACRAMENTO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT. IN MY OPINION A VERY- IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CITY IS THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE IS THE- OF ECONOMIC DIVERSITY THE ETHNIC DIVERSITY ET CETERA. AS I HAVE TALKED TO THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT I INTERACT WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO DISTRACTION. IS THAT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE IF THEY'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO SOME LEVEL OF INAPPROPRIATE POLICE CONDUCT LET ME TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY WHAT I MEAN. IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY I GAVE. EXAMPLES PRETTY LIVE THE IN SOME CASES OF. AN OFFICER USING SOMETHING OTHER THAN DEADLY FORCE INAPPROPRIATELY. AND THE PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE ACTIONS I QUOTED MY LAW SCHOOL DEAN I'M A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. AND IRWIN CHAIRMAN SKI HAS WRITTEN AND A BRILLIANT BOOK REALLY LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. AND IN ONE SEGMENT WHAT HE DOES IS EXPLORES THE CONCEPT THAT NOT EVERY ASPECT OF POLICE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IS WITH THE USE OF THAT DEADLY FORCE HE TALKS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT VIOLATIONS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT SEARCH AND SEIZURE. REQUIREMENTS AND THE FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE AND WITHOUT GOING INTO THAT WHOLE DETAIL THAT- TREATMENT HAS BEEN NOW RELEGATED TO MY REMARKS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO YOUR STAFF. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AN ASPECT OF THAT BUT- AND THEN I. WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS THE SPECIFIC RECOMMEND IS THAT I HAVE. IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCE AND I'M SURE THE OTHER RETURNING A SIMPLE COULD ATTEST TO THIS WE HAVE CERTAIN THRESHOLDS OF WHERE WE CAN ACCEPT CASES IN OUR INTAKE PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS OF COURSE WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THEY'RE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A LEGAL RIGHT FOR WHATEVER IS THE CLAIM WRONG OF THE PERSON WHO'S COME TO OUR OFFICE AND QUITE HONESTLY THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENTLY. A LEVEL OF DAMAGES THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPLAINANT IF IN FACT WE PROCEED WITH LITIGATION LET'S TAKE LITIGATION OFF THE TABLE BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMPLAINTS THAT DON'T MEET THAT THRESHOLD I'VE HAD NUMEROUS CASES INCLUDING A WOMAN WHO CAME IN AND SAID WHILE SHE WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY HER BREAST IN HER ENFORCEMENT. SHE DIDN'T HAVE VIDEO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE WITNESSES WHO COULD CORROBORATE HER CLAIMS BUT SHE MADE A VERY LEGITIMATE SET OF CLAIMS IN MY OPINION THAT THIS HAD IN FACT OCCURRED BECAUSE WE COULD NOT LOCATE ANY VIDEO CORROBORATING EVIDENCE OR CORROBORATING WITNESSES WE WERE UNABLE TO TAKE THAT CASE AS A LITIGATION MATTER. BUT WHAT WE DID SUGGEST SHE DO AND SHE FOLLOWED UP WAS TO FILE A COMPLAINT THERE IS THE LITIGATION PATH WE ALL KNOW THE TO DEAL WITH THE TOWARDS ACT YOU'VE GOT A FILE WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME WITHIN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT THAT'S CREATE A GEISHA BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE IT INTO THE PRE LITIGATION SPACE WHO LEGITIMATELY HAVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TREATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN THEIR JURISDICTION WHAT ABOUT THEM THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE COMMITTEE WILL SPEND SOME TIME TAKING A LOOK AT AND WE HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS RELATIVE TO WHAT SHE CHANGE IN THAT PROCESS WE JUSTHEARD OF A STATEMENT ABOUT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ATTORNEY MUSTAD THE TALKED ABOUT WAS THE STATUE LIMITATIONS IN THE TOLD THE OBSTRUCTIVE LOCATION. IT'S. PRETTY CLEAR AND CAL WARN YOU THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BRING A COMPANY. AGAINST AN OFF YOU ONLY HAVE AMOUNT OF TIME TO IT. AND THAT TOO. IS ONE YEAR OR LESS IT'S NOT THAT THREE YEAR PROCESS SO IF WE HAVE A PERSON WHO IS WHO'S CLAIMING ABUSE AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE- COMPLAINT IF YOU WILL. A GATHERED TOGETHER IN THE TIME PERIOD ALLOWED THERE GOES THAT COMPLAINT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE PART OF WHAT SENATOR BRADFORD BRADFORD AND THE REST OF YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH IN SB TO. GETTING RID OF BAD COPS WHO MOVED FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THIS DOESN'T BECOME PART OF THAT RECORD IF A PERSON IS IN A POSITION. TO BRING FORWARD THERE ARE QUITE SO WE HOPE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU WILL AGREE SHOULD HAPPEN THROUGHOUT OUR STATE FIRST AND FOREMOST. THERE OUGHT TO BE A TEMPLATE IN PLACE WE KNOW IT'S A LOCAL JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE TO SET UP TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER TO HAVE OR NOT HAVE. POLICE ADVISORY. EAST OVERSIGHT ADVISORY BOARD SOME IN TERMS OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND I'VE GONE AS FAR AS TO GIVE THEIR POLICE ADVISORY APPARATUS SUBPOENA POWER. THE PEOPLE COME AND TESTIFY ARE TESTIFYING UNDER OATH I LIKE THAT MODEL. BUT IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS JUST WITHIN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A SYSTEM WITHIN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO THAT IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE SYSTEM. THAT IS IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO WHEN ONE IS BEING BRINGING A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS TO IN. IT HAS TO BE SOME CONSISTENCY IF A PERSON MOVES FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE OF SACRAMENTO THEY CAN MOVE FROM THE CITY TO THE COUNTY. AND THEY HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT INTAKE SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF LODGING A COMPLAINT AGAINST A POLICE OFFICER WE HOPE THERE'LL BE SOME CHANGES. THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT IN THAT REGARD. ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS LODGED WHERE DOES IT GO WELL THE GHOST INTERNAL AFFAIRS. MANY OF MY CLIENTS BELIEVE THAT INTERNAL AFFAIRS PERSON IS NO MORE THAN A COP IN THE SUIT. I MEAN THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TRUSTING THAT THE SYSTEM WILL IN FACT GIVE CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION. TO THEIR CLIENT WE HOPE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO GIVE PEOPLE A HECK OF A LOT MORE COMFORT. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTAKE OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST OFFICER OR DEPARTMENT MISBEHAVIOR THIRD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- IS REALLY NEAR AND DEAR TO ME IS THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS I'VE HAD WHO SAID I'M NOT GOING FOR WITH ANY COMPLAINT. FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS NUMBER ONE I'M ON PAROLE NUMBER TWO I'M ON PROBATION NUMBER THREE I GOT OUTSTANDING WARRANTS OR NUMBER FOUR I'M IN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO TRIGGERING DEPORTATION PROCESS BY MAKING A COMPLAINT AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE REAL AND THAT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VICTIMIZED AND DISENFRANCHISED. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LITTLE IF YOU WILL LET ON THEM. THEY ARE NOT COMING FORWARD BECAUSE OF ALL THESE OTHER CHALLENGES AND I HOPE THERE'S A WAY THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN COME UP WITH A CHANGE TO THE SYSTEM IN PROCESS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE VERY VICTIMS. OF POLICE AN APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR COME FOR. OF FINALLY THE FACT THAT YOU FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER TYPICALLY IN ONE OF TWO OR THREE PLACES CITY HALL. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT- THAT ONE DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT'S LIKE INVITING THE CHICKEN INTO THE FOX DIæN. BATTLING DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE FOR THE THIRD IS IN SOME BROADER ADMINISTRATIVE- BUILDING ASSOCIATED WITH CITY GOVERNMENT IN SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IN CITY HALL. BUT IT'S NOT IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NOR IS IT IN THE AMERICAN CITY COUNCIL'S OFFICE IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE LOCATION THAT I ASSUME PEOPLE FEEL WILL BE MORE WELCOMING. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FILING COMPLAINTS WE I HOPE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BRING TO THE PEOPLE WHAT THE PEOPLE NEED. M. BY THAT WHAT I MEAN IS WE SHOULD HAVE. NGOS AND NONPROFITS THAT CAN INTAKE COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE DEPARTMENT IT'S GOING FROM BARE TO WHATEVER THE NEXT STEP IS IN THE HOUSE SO THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY WELL THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE- YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A SECURE ENVIRONMENT. AND ONE IN WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE A MANIPULATION OF THE PROCESS ALL WE'RE TLKING ABOUT IS AN INTAKE OF THE COMPLAINT IN MOST JURISDICTIONS YOU CAN DO THAT NOW VIRTUALLY VIA THE INTERNET. SO TO HAVE. EXISTING CREDIBLE NGOS THAT ARE WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES BEING THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN% BRING. A LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT WE THINK MAKES A HECK OF A LOT OF SENSE AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. AT SOME POINT GOING FORWARD FROMTHIS POINT FROM THIS POINT SO THOSE ARE THE BIG CONCERNS I HAVE AN EXTENSIVE- TEN PAGES OF TESTIMONY THAT I HAVE OFFERED TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU WTH ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS- I WILL SAY THAT THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO. DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN OUR STATE I HAVE BEEN ON THE RIGHT PATH UNFORTUNATELY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GO ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH THAT SB TWO I KNOW SENATOR BRADFORD AND OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT GOING BACK. AND TAKING ANOTHER STAB AT DOING WHAT IS RIGHT RELATIVE TO THE QUALIFIED. IMMUNITY THE FACT THAT NINE THE NINE POINT. EIGHT OF THE JUDGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT BY A GOVERNMENT I TELL PEOPLE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS WHOLE SYSTEM. IS AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THE OFFICERS FOUND TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE IT'S NOT BE OFFICER WHO WRITES THE CHECK OF COURSE IT'S THE JURISDICTION. WHO PLOY THE OFFICER THAT HAS TO CHANGE SO WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HARRISON FREESHEET YOUR PRESENTATION. AGAIN WOULD JUST ASK IF YOU CAN PLEASE. STAND BY- WE HAVE FEWER PALACE WE WANT TO GET TO AND HEAR FROM- AND THEN WILL BE OPENING UP FOR MY COLLEAGUES HERE TO.

WELL I PERSONALLY AM THE CHAIR OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PRACTICE GROUP- WHICH MEANS I WORK PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH ALL OF THEIR LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT ISSUES FROM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING- GETTING TO THOSE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS- TO THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM- HEAVY DOSE OF MY PRACTICES INVOLVED HERE- TO LITIGATION INVOLVING- HE'LL BE ALRIGHT- AND THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IN GENERAL. AND I'VE LITIGATED ALL THE WAY YOU KNOW FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS THEMSELVES THE APPEAL HEARINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A PROVIDE ADVICE AND COUNSEL. TO CHIEFS OF POLICE AND SHERIFFS. IN THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS DONE CORRECTLY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW- AND THEN ON OCCASION WHERE THESE MATTERS GO TO THE COURTS- I LITIGATE THOSE THERE AS WELL. AND SO I'VE SEEN THESE THINGS- FROM UP FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT MR STAGNATE I WANT YOUR PRIOR SPEAKERS I HE AND I ARE IN THE SAME. LANE IF YOU WILL ACCEPT HE'S ON ONE SIDE AND I'M ON THE OTHER HE REPRESENTS THE UNIONS I AM REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT AND SALAS SO JUST BE CLEAR THAT THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I THAT I COME FROM- I TRY TO HELP THE CHIEFS IF YOU WILL. DO THE RIGHT THING INVESTIGATE THESE COMPLAINTS THAT I'M MISTER HARRIS JUST MENTION WHEN THEY. DO COME OUT. ON YEAH AND I DO ROB. THE BIG SMALL AND CHALLENGES AND DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES DO SOMEWHAT DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE AGENCY I WORK FOR. VERY LARGE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS DO VERY SMALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS YOU KNOW WITH WITH. TEN PLUS POLICE OFFICERS IN THEIR ENTIRE AGENCY. AND UP BECAUSE OF THE DISCREPANCY IN THE SIZE OF AGENCIES. THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS ONE SIZE FITS ALL'S IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT- BECAUSE OF. THE SIZE OF THE AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT- THE- QUESTION POSED IS HOW DOES THE P. O. B. R. WORK IN PRACTICE- BPOP ARE AT- IT'S FOUND IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY THREE HUNDRED THREE WITH THIRTY THREE THIRTEEN IT DOESN'T A LOT OF THINGS NOT JUST. REGULATE THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. APPRECIATE THAT IT THIRTY THREE OH TWO FOR EXAMPLE RIVER REGULATES POLITICAL ACTIVITY ON DUTY- THIRTY THREE OH THREE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE IS ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PROVISIONS IN MY ESTIMATION AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT REGULATES HOW ADMINISTRATIVE INTERROGATIONS% ARE CONDUCTED- THIRTY THREE IT ALSO IT FOR EXAMPLE- THIRTY THREE OH THREE REGULATES THE TIMING. AND LENGTH OF INTERVIEWS OR INTERROGATIONS WITH OFFICERS REGULATES WHO CAN ASK QUESTIONS. IT MANDATES ADVANCE NOTICE OF WHAT THE OFFICER WILL BE QUESTIONED ABOUT. IT HAS PROVISIONS REGARDING CREE INTERROGATION DISCOVERY SO INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROVIDED TO THE OFFICER PRIOR TO BEING QUESTIONED- THERE ARE PROVISIONS ON THAT AS MR MISTAKE YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR MIRANDA WARNINGS AND USE IMMUNITY. WHEN THE MATTER BEING INVESTIGATED. HAS BOTH CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS- AND THEN THERE'S ALL THE RIGHT FOR THE OFFICER TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HIS OR HER CHOICE PRESENT DURING THE INVESTIGATORY INTERVIEW. SECTION THIRTY THREE OF FOUR IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROVISION UP THE FUEL BR THAT ONE MANDATES AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL- FOR PUNITIVE ACTION. ONE OF THINGS I THINK TO ROOM- THAT DIFFERENTIATES THE POP ARE IN THE F. B. O. R. FROM. LAWS THAT IMPLICATE OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IS THE LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE. OR PEACE OFFICER OR FIREFIGHTER- WHERE THEY CAN APPEAL IT. IS MUCH LOWER. WRITTEN REPRIMANDS ARE COVERED FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THIRTY THREE OH FOUR. AND IN PRACTICE WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF AN OFFICER GETS A WRITTEN REPRIMAND FOR VIOLATION OF POLICY WHICH- IN ALL THESE AGENCIES THERE ARE CONCEPTS OF WHAT ARE WHAT IS CALLED PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE- YOU START WITH LOWER LEVEL DISCIPLINE UNLESS IT'S A VERY VERY SERIOUS ACT OF MISCONDUCT. AND THEN- YOU PROGRESSIVELY. MAKE IT MORE SEVERE WELL WITH WRITTEN REPRIMANDS THOSE CAN BE APPEALED SOMETIMES THOSE APPEAL HEARINGS CAN TAKE MULTIPLE BREAKS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE'S A SOMEWHAT OF A DISINCENTIVE FOR A SUPERVISOR TO ISSUE A WRITTEN REPRIMAND TO CORRECT BEHAVIOR- AND THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE IF YOU WILL- GIVEN THE WAY THE P. O. B. R. IS WRITTEN AT PRESENT- THIRTY THREE OH FOUR ALSO HAS WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY WHICH I THINK IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT PROVISION WHICH IS THAT ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PERIOD- THAT IS- IN MY VIEW- EIGHT. AS AN AREA THAT I THINK IF THE COMMITTEE IS KALRA TRUST SOMETHING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO ARE STRONGLY TAKE A LOOK AT- WELL I AGREE WITH MR STATNY THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THERE FOR TOTALING- I DON'T AGREE THAT IT'S AS EASY AS HE MAKES IT SEEM TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION AND ONE YEAR IN ALL CASES ARE THERE CERTAINLY- SITUATIONS THAT I'VE HELPED OUR CLIENTS WITH WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET WITNESSES AND PARTICULARLY NON CIVILIAN WITNESSES WHOM AND MAYBE ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD. OR UNAVAILABLE FOR ONE REASON OR THE OTHER- TO GET THAT INVESTIGATION COMPLETED REVIEWED EVALUATED AND THEN THE NOTICE OF DISCIPLINE TO GO OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER IN A IN A ONE YEAR PERIOD IS NOT AS EASY AS AS ONE WOULD THINK AND ALL CAJUNS AND MISSING IT BY A SINGLE DAY- RESULT IN NO DISCIPLINE BEING IMPOSED AGAINST THE OFFICER AT ALL- SO BUT THAT IS A THAT IS A PROVISION OF THIRTY THREE OH FOUR- THERE ARE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE P. O. B. R. THIRTY THREE OH FIVE THIRTY THREE OF SIX AND THIRTY THREE OF SIX POINT FIVE WHICH REGULATE- WHAT CAN GO INTO A POLICE OFFICERS- PERSONNEL FILE. AND THESE PROVIDE ALSO ALLOWING. TO REVIEW IF REQUEST THAT MATERIAL BE REMOVED FROM THE FILE. AND GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO SUBMIT REBUTTAL MATERIAL- TO YOU KNOW A POOR ABOUT UA ATION- DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR OTHER. ADVERSE COMMENTS- THAT MIGHT GO INTO AN OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FILE POINT FIVE IS ANOTHER PROVISIONAL POLE BAR- THAT PROHIBITS. A DEPARTMENT FROM TERMINATING OR DISCIPLINING. AN OFFICER BECAUSE THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN PLACED ON A ON A PROSECUTOR'S BRADY LIST. AND THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS TO THAT- BRADY LIST IS. SOMETHING THAT- DA'S OFFICES KEEP- CONCERNING OFFICERS WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF DISHONESTY AND OTHER ACTS OF MISCONDUCT THAT- MAY JEOPARDIZE THEIR ABILITY TO PROSECUTE A CASE I HAVE TO TURN THAT INFORMATION OVER TO CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS- THIS PROVISION WHICH WAS ADDED MORE RECENTLY SAYS DEPARTMENT SORRY- YOU CANNOT DISCIPLINE- IT. THIS OFFICER WHO AND IN MANY WAYS IS NO LONGER USED HERE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE A GOOD WITNESS- YOU CANNOT DISCIPLINE THEM. BECAUSE THE DA HAS DIEM THEM- UNTRUSTWORTHY AS A WITNESS- THIRTY THREE OH SEVEN- OF THE ACT THE ACT PROHIBITS LIGHTED TRACTOR TEST MR STAGNATION THAT- THIRTY THREE OF SEVEN POINT FIVE REGULATES THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF OFFICERS THIRTY THREE OH EIGHT- REGULATES ENQUIRIES INTO OFFICER FINANCES EXCEPT IN SOME. EXCEPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS LIKE VIæT. SEE AN UNDERCOVER ASSIGNMENTS. THIRTY THREE- NOT. REGULATES SEARCH OF OFFICE LOCKERS- THIRTY THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROVISION IT'S WHAT I CALL THE REMEDIES PROVISION FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE BEAT PBR. AND THAT PROVISIONS. ARE ALLOWS THAT THAT SPECIFIES WHAT THE REMEDIES ARE WHEN THERE IS A VIOLATION IN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE IS. YEAH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WHICH AS A PRACTICAL MATTER MEANS SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE FOR WORK OR THE OVERTURNING OF DISCIPLINE WHEN THERE'S BEEN A MISSTEP BY AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR- OR THERE IS THAT- IN A MINOR VIOLATION OF THE ACT OF FOR EXAMPLE NOT GIVING THEM ENOUGH NOTICE OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE INTERROGATED ABOUT- YOU KNOW- STUFF LIKE THAT THAT CAN. OVERTURN OR SUPPRESS EVIDENCE WHERE WHICH CAN KEEP AN OFFICER- ON THE JOB WHEN PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T BE- SO THOSE ARE THE SIGNIFICANT. PROVISIONS OF THE P. O. B. R. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IN PRACTICE I THINK ONE THING TO. ALSO REMEMBER AND SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED THIS ALREADY- BUT THERE ARE OTHER LAWS. THAT IMPOSE IMPORTANT P. DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THAT. ARE OUTSIDE OF THE ACTUAL PO PR THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO I THINK KEEP ON YOUR RADAR AS A COMMITTEE. OF ONE IS THE MYERS MILLIONS PRODUCT- THAT IS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL UNIONS IN CALIFORNIA- IT'S BEEN MENTIONED HERE THAT YOU KNOW ALL UNIONS DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE A WHOLE HOST. OF THINGS FROM SALARY OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO TO OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCLUDING DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES ARE THE THERE'S AMOR AND- USE CONCERT THAT HAVE DISCIPLINED GUIDELINES AND MATROSKA IS LET'S SAY YOU KNOW AN OFFICER CAN ONLY BE PENALIZED SUCH AND SUCH FORCE THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED JUST NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT- IF THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE ACT- THOSE CAN BE ADDRESSED. THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THEORETICALLY AND ON THERE ARE THINGS I THINK THE COMMITTEE COULD DO TO PREVENT THAT IF IT SO CHOSE. ON THE OTHER- LAW THAT IS IMPLICATED HERE IS BEING. I JUST STATUTES. YOU KNOW CODES EIGHT TWO PER SAID AND THE EVIDENCE CODES TEN THREE. AT SAC. THOSE CONCERNED ACCESS TO PEACE OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORDS- BY THE PUBLIC AND- OTHER INDIVIDUALS THIRD PARTIES- DOES IMPACT THE DISAPPOINTING PROCESS IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. ANY SORT OF CHANGES TO THE POPE ARE- I WOULD SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT ALL THREE OF THEM TOGETHER- BECAUSE THEY ALL ARE INTERRELATED IN SOME MANNER- ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD INTRESTING IS. HOW INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONDUCTED WITH POLL ARE ON A KIND OF A DAY TO DAY BASIS. AND I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH YOU SO YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE GENERALLY SPEAKING I AM- AND PEOPLE MY FARM ARE ON THE FRONTLINE. AND THAT WE ARE CONTACTED BY A POLICE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THEM PLAN COMES UP. AND WE OFTEN GET QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO- AND HOW TO GO THROUGH THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE IN A LEGALLY COMPLIANT AND FAIR MANNER. TO THE OFFICER AND ALSO TO THE COMPLAINANT- AS I WILL SAY THE INTERNAL FIT AFFAIRS PROFESSIONALS THAT WE WORK WITH. THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL. THEY DO FOR THE MOST THERE'S ALWAYS BAD APPLES IN EVERY BUNCH AND I WILL- REALLY KNOWLEDGE THAT BUT FOR THE MOST PART. THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THEY WANT A POLICE THEIR PROFESSION ARE THEY WANT TO DO IT IN A FAIR. MANNER. AND A LEGALLY COMPLIANT MANNER COMES IN- AND ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THEY CAN THE COMPLAINT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF AS A COMPLAINT ESTADO WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT SAYS I BELIEVE MY RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED OR THIS OFFICER DID SOMETHING WRONG. ONE OF THE- ISSUES AND IT REALLY IMPLICATES THE STATURE LIMITATIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER- IS THAT WHAT CAN TRIGGER THE STATUE LIMITATIONS RUNNING IS NOT JUST A WRITTEN COMPLAINT. IT'S ANY SORT OF INFORMATION BY SOMEONE AUTHORIZED TO INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS. THAT WOULD PUT THAT PERSON ON NOTICE THAT THE OFFICER MIGHT HAVE ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT. UP THERE'S A THERE'S A CASE THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS THE NUANCES OF THIS THAT'S PEDRO VERSUS CITY OF LOS ANGELES- BUT I THINK THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST TO SEE HOW THE NEW WATCH THIS CAN BE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT COMING IN THERE SHOULD BE AN ITERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION OPEN ON THE STAY THERE ARE. PRE COMPLAINT- INFORMATION THAT YOU COME INTO OUR DEPARTMENT YOU MIGHT EVEN NOT KNOW WHO HE OFICERS IT'S WHAT THEIR NAME IS. THAT CAN TRIGGER THE STATUE LIMITATIONS AND IF AND IF AGAIN THE YOU PUT APARTMENT MISSES IT BY ONE DAY- DISCIPLINE CANNOT. BE IMPOSED AGAINST THAT OFFICER- BUT- THE NEXT IS TO OPEN THE INTO THE FORMAL INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION. IT'LL BE AN INVESTIGATOR ASSIGNED- SOME DEPARTMENTS- LARGER DEPARTMENTS IN PARTICULAR- HAVE INTERNAL AFFAIRS UNITS I WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATION OF MANY OTHER APARTMENTS CONTRACT THAT THAT OUT- BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE DO NOT HAVE THE STAFFING. TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND THERE ARE A HOST OF A PRIVATE SECTOR- COMPANIES INVESTIGATIVE COMPANIES THAT STAFF BETTER STAFF OF LAWYERS US SOME EX LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS- AND THEY ARE- OBJECTIVE AND NEUTRAL IN MY EXPERIENCE- THAT'S PART OF THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. IF THEY'RE NOT OBJECTIVE AND NEUTRAL THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET REPEAT BUSINESS BECAUSE- WHAT WHAT THEY'RE BEING HIRED FOR IS THAT OBJECTIVITY AND NEUTRALITY RELEVANT DOCUMENTS- THEY WILL INTERVIEW WITNESSES USUALLY THE COMPLAINT IT IS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWED- OTHER INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED OR INTERVIEWED AND ULTIMATELY THE SUBJECTS OF THE INVESTIGATION THE ACCUSED OFFICER OR OFFICERS. ARE INTERVIEWED AS WELL- PRIOR TO BEING INTERVIEWED THE SUBJECTS YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THEY HAVE TO BE. NOTIFIED OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT. AND IF THAT IS NOT DONE PROPERLY- THAT IS ANOTHER BASIS FOR A POOL BAR VIOLATION WHERE EVIDENCE CAN BE SUPPRESSED OR THE DISCIPLINE OVERTURNED- YOU KNOW AS AN EXAMPLE I HAD A CLIENT OF- RECENTLY WHO. CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT INVOLVING AN OFFICER. AND THE NOTICE THAT THE DEPARTMENT PREPARED MENTIONED THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT- THERE WAS ALSO THOUGH IN AN ALLEGATION THAT THE OFFICER HAD USED- JOGS AND HAD TAKEN HIS PATROL CAR OUTSIDE OF. CITY LIMITS- WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION TO DO SO AND THE INVESTIGATOR ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. WOULD BE HE NEGLECTED TO PUT IT INTO THE NOTIFICATION THAT WANT TO THE OFFICER- THE HEARING OFFICER ON THE CASE SUPPRESSED ALL OF THE EVIDENCE ABOUT YOU THE USE OF DRUGS THEME CITY LIMITS FOR PERSONAL REASONS- HE HANDS YOU KNOW THAT IS A FACT OF LIFE- BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATOR MADE A MISTAKE AND THAT SCENARIO- D. COMPLAIN IT WILL BE I MEAN THE- DEFUSED IMPLORE YOU WILL BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. USUALLY IT CAN BE- I'M NOT ATTORNEY REPRESENTATIVE THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES IN GETTING A DATE- THAT CAN SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS BUT I AGREE WITH MR STAGNATE- GIVEN THE CASE LAW AS IT STANDS NOW- THERE'S A REALLY SHORT LEASH AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN ORDER THE OFFICER AND- RELATIVELY QUICKLY- ONE OF THE ISSUES THOUGH WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE ISSUE IS. AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THE SAME ATTORNEY IS OFTEN REPRESENTING THE ACCUSED OFFICER AND ALSO REPRESENTING OTHER OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION AND STE. WITH THAT COMES THE POSSIBILITY OF- THE SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN WITNESSES AND THE SUBJECT. AND S. AS AT PRESENT THAT'S PERMITTED UNDER THE ACT- AFTER THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED WHICH MEANS IT'LL BE A REPORT DRAFTED- FOR THE TYPICALLY THE CHIEF OF POLICE OR THE EXECUTIVES WITHIN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT IS REVIEWED- ANALYZED AND IF CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN IF THERE ARE SUSTAIN FINDINGS AGAINST THE OFFICER- THERE WILL BE A NOTICE OF INTENT TO DISCIPLINE AND THAT'S WHERE THE SCALY PROCESS THAT MISTER MISDIAGNOSIS- MENTIONED EARLIER COMES INTO PLAY- THERE ARE. THREE DISCIPLINE- DUE PROCESS RIGHTS TO COME FROM THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND THEN THERE ARE POST DISCIPLINE. DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AS WELL WHICH IS A IS A HEARING FOR NEUTRAL HEARING OFFICER. AND THAT'S A RIGHT THAT EXISTS FOR ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO IT REALLY YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE STATED NECESSARILY IN THE P. O. B. R. CONSENT APPLIES ANYWAY IT'S A MATTER OF. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW- BUT BUT THAT IS THE PROCESS THERE WILL BE NO SOME TENT SKELLY MEETING. AND THEN AN APPEAL PROCESS AND SOME OF THESE APPEALS APPEAL HEARINGS- THEY MADE SOMETHING MAY ONE DAY. OF THE DEPENDING THE ALLEGATIONS SOME OF THEM CAN BE. I'VE HAD CASES WHERE THERE TWENTY PLUS DAYS OF HEARINGS ABOUT WHETHER THE OFFICER ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT OR NOT- AND- I WOULD SAY THE TWENTY DAY ONE IS UNUSUAL MOSTLY THERE THREE FOUR FIVE DAYS- IN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY. BUT IT'S A TIME CONSUMING AND ERROR CAN BE COSTLY TO THE AGENCY- THEY DO HAVE TO PAY FOR REPRESENTATION. BOTH AT THE INVESTIGATION STAGE ULTIMATELY THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYEE AGENCY THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF. AS THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO ESTABLISH THAT THE OFFICERS ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT THE LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE WAS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AS FAR AS WHO HEARS THE APPEAL- IT VARIES FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY. SOME INVOLVE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSIONS OR PERSONNEL BOARDS THAT ARE APPOINTED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS- IN MY EXPERIENCE THOUGH MOST OF THE HEARINGS THAT THAT WE ARE INVOLVED IN THEIR THEIR HEARD BY PRIVATE ARBITRATORS. EACH OF WHICH HAS THEIR OWN- USE ON. WHAT DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE OR SHOULD NOT BE A LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS SUMMER CONSIDER PRO EMPLOYEE SUMMER CONSIDER PROBLEM MANAGEMENT- BUT THEY WILL MAKE THE DECISION AND MANY MANY CASES AN ARBITRATOR HI AND WILL SECOND GUESS IF YOU WILL THE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE. AND FROM THERE THE LOSER CAN GO TO COURT YOU CAN FILE A PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATOR. MANDAMUS UNDER CIVIL CONSUMER SEIZURE TEN NINETY FOUR POINT FIVE. AND THAT CAN GO UP TO THEM THE APPELLATE COURTS ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT- SO- ONE LAST POINT- BELIEVE THE PANEL WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I RECEIVED ANYWAY IT WAS- HOW DOES THE POV ARE ONLINE OR NOT ALIGNED WITH THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PUBLIC SERVANTS IN CALIFORNIA- ONE UNDER INVESTIGATION. FROM THE DIFFERENCES IN IN MY VIEW ARE THAT THE PROSPECTS OF EVIDENCE BEING SUPPRESSED. DUE TO A VIOLATION OF THE POP ARE SIMPLY JUST DON'T EXIST WITH OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYEES- SO IN A YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF THE P. O. B. R. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS AS IT STANDS NOW GENERALLY SPEAKING THE EVIDENCES. IS SUPPRESSED AND SOMETIMES THE DISCIPLINE IS OVERTURNED EVEN IF IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I'M NON INTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF THE ACT. THAT DOESN'T APPLY THAT CONCEPT DOESN'T APPLY- TO. IN OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYEES GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE STATUE LIMITATIONS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT'S ONE YEAR- AND HELP WELL WHILE I AGREE MOST OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS CAN AND SHOULD. AND QUITE FRANKLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN INCENTIVE TO COMPLETE IN ONE YEAR THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS FOR AND THE INABILITY TO DO THAT CAN BE CAN LEAD TO SOME DRACONIAN RESULTS- OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOTICE OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE INTERROGATED ABOUT- PRIOR TO THE INVESTIGATION. AT LEAST NOT THE EXTENT I BELIEVE UNDER AS THEY AS OFFICERS TO UNDER POPE R. OR FIREFIGHTERS TO UNDER FOLLOW ARE INTERROGATION DISCOVERY GENERALLY SPEAKING FOR OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYEES LIKE TERROR. THERE IS FOR OFFICERS THERE'S A CASE- SANTA ANA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION VERSUS CITY OF SANTA ANA. I WHICH IS HELD AND NOT IF AN OFFICER IS IN. A SUBJECT OFFICER IS AND TARGETED TWICE. SO SAY THE- THE INVESTIGATOR NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICER ASKED SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. OF THAT COURT AID THAT AND IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED THIS WAY BUT AT LEAST BY THE UNION LETTERS THAT WE GET- THAT THE OFFICERS ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING IN THE INVESTIGATORS POSSESSION- OTHER WHAT OTHER WITNESSES HAVE SAID. TRANSCRIPTOME INTERVIEWS ALL THE DOCUMENTS COLLECTED- ALL OF THAT STUFF NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECT OFFICER IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A SECOND INTERVIEW OF THAT OFFICER. AND THAT IS IN MANY WAYS NOT A SOUND INVESTIGATORS- PROVIDING ALL THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE SOME OFFICERS WILL TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND TAILOR THEIR TESTIMONY ACCORDINGLY- I MENTION THIS- THE LEVEL. AT WHICH AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OF IS PERMITTED FOR A AN EMPLOYEE IS LOWER FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND FOR FIREFIGHTERS THAN OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THEY CAN APPEAL WRITTEN REPRIMANDS WHICH- IN MY VIEW IT SOMETIMES IS A IS A DISINCENTIVE TO ISSUE THAT LOWER LEVEL DISCIPLINE BECAUSE- IT CAN TRIGGER AN EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS- AND- THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF THE PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND SO. I DON'T THINK- DISINCENTIVE ISING THAT IS NECESSARY GREAT PUBLIC POLICY- AND THEN THERE ARE PROVISIONS AS I MENTIONED IN THE POLL ARE ABOUT- PEACE OFFICER PERSONNEL FILES AND WANT TO GO INTO THEM AND THE OFFICERS RIGHT TO. HAVE INFORMATION REMOVED FROM THEM- THAT. IS AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW NOT APPLICABLE TO OTHER TYPES OF THEM PULLED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES GENERALLY SPEAKING- IT IS A MATTER OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THERE ARE AGENCIES THAT DO YOU. AGREE TO PROVISIONS LIKE THAT BUT- IT'S NOT PART OF A- ST APT IF YOU WELL. SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND BITING ME TO PARTICIPATE MISTER SHELDON THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION YOU BROUGHT OUT OF THE FORCE AND REPRESENTING- THE GROUP OF CHIEF THAT YOU REPRESENT AND SO WITH THAT BEING SAID WE WANT TO MOVE INTO THE Q. AND A AND WE HOPE THAT ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS ARE STILL WITH US. SO THAT WE CAN- DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ASK QUESTIONS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND GUERRA FEELS LIKE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN SO THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE YOU AND WE CAN BEGIN SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- I JUST ASKED MY COLLEAGUES TO- WE'LL I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW MOMENTS- RIGHT AFTER I AS HIS FIRST QUESTIONS TO CHIME IN. AND WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AND YOU CAN PROCEED WITH YOUR QUESTIONS WHOMEVER YOU WANT TO OR JUST A GENERAL QUESTION FOR WHOEVER WANTS AND FEEL- CAPABLE OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- TO WHAT EXTENT DO DEPARTMENTS VALUE COMMUNITY INPUT IN THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION PROCESS AGAIN WELL I'M TO WHAT EXTENT DO DEPARTMENTS VALUE COMMUNITY INPUT. INTO INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS- PROCESS SO WE'RE WHAT LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION- FEEL FREE TO DO THAT LET ME GO TO IS THEIR CHIEF WITH US CHIEF YEAH SURE YEAH I CAN I CAN NOT ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED IN TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES- I CAN TELL YOU IT DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT- CHIEF SINCE YOU'RE ALWAYS VALUE COMMUNITY INPUT OF LIGHT OFFICERS NOT SO MUCH- BUT I BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW I AS THE CHIEF OF POLICE A PARTICULARLY HERE IN LOS ANGELES- VALUE COMMUNITY INPUT AND- AS I LISTEN TO- THE ATTORNEY AT THE CIVIL LITIGATION ATTORNEY TALK. ABOUT VARIOUS WAYS TO RECEIVE COMPLAIN IT'S AN WERE PEOPLE ARE TO. BRING COME TO- KNOW TO THAT VERY PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED INVESTIGATE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TREPIDATION- IN SEOUL YOU KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO RAISE. ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT- THROUGH THE INTERNET THROUGH THIRD PARTY THROUGH- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ANOTHER OTHER VEHICLES- I THINK COMMUNITY INPUT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AS PARTICULARLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. WHERE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- THAT WE ARE WILLING TO LISTEN- AND- BE OBJECTIVE ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS AND I CAN TELL YOU CARRYING- A YOUNG MAN WHO'S GROWN UP HERE IN THE INNER CITY. ALL MY LIFE- AND WALKED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THERE THAT- OFTEN IT'S FELT THAT WE AS LAW ENFORCEMENT DO NOT. TAKE THESE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY- AND- SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE THAT YOU KNOW OF POLICIES BEING ENACTED WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO VOICE THEIR OPINION SO WE HAVE THE COMMISSION ON- CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION HERE IN LOS ANGELES AND I THINK THAT'S AN- IMPORTANT TOOL HERE. TO ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO COME VOICE THEIR CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN. YES IF I MAY THIS IS ATTORNEY HARRIS I LOVE WHAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE SAID AND HE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF PUBLIC OFFICIAL. WHO GETS IT- IN SACRAMENTO WHERE I LIVE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I COULD ADMIT THIS NOW BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO RETIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. CHIEF HAN AND I COMMUNICATED ON A REGULAR BASIS. YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE ADVERSARIES WE WERE BOTH. DO THE SAME THING BRING ABOUT JUSTICE ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO SO I WOULD. DIRECTLY WITH TEXT LATE AT NIGHT OR ON THE WEEKENDS. IT'S THE WILL OF THE CHIEF THE CHIEF IS THE ONE WHO SETS THE TONE THIS CHIEF WHO JUST SPOKE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT. SO I WOULD COMMEND HIM FOR THAT I WOULD SAY THAT YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY INSPECTOR GENERAL'S IN MANY PROCESSES ISSUE WHAT. HAPPENS UP THE FOOD CHAIN CHEAPER. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE CHANGES TO THIS PROCESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP- AND WHOEVER WANTS TO CHIME IN IS THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MAKING COMPLAINTS. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THERE'S A FACTORTHAT ARE IN FACT INTIMIDATED TO NOT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT BUT AS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY STEP UP TO THE PLATE IN MAKE IN LOGIC COMPLAINT. AND HEAR NOTHING HERE NO FOLLOW THROUGH THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT WE GET THE MISTRUST THE SWEEPING OF THE ROCK. AND PEOPLE FAILED THAT OTHER COMPLAINT GOES ON ANSWER- AND I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS IN WHICH THERE'S A FOLLOW UP THERE IS- I LEASE A CALL BACK OR CONCLUSION AS RELATES TO ONCE COMPLAINTS OLD PEOPLE DOESN'T FEEL THAT ASPHALT IS FALLING ON DEAF EARS SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO CHIME IN ON THAT AND I HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION. AND THEN I'LL HAVE MY COLLEAGUES WOULD IS DO BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN YES ON YOUR ON YOUR LAST COMMENT. THAT'S PROVIDED FOR IN THE LAW AS WE SPEAK IN. AND EIGHT THIRTY TO AT SENATE STATUTE THERE IS INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE RETURNED TO THE COMPLAINT I WANT TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS THEY'RE VERY MINDFUL AND CONCERNED ABOUT MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY. AND BEING A PART OF THIS PROCESS AS A STAKEHOLDER I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR A COUPLE OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF CITIZENS COMING FORWARD AND MAKING COMPLAINTS THERE IS I MULTIPLICITY OF AVENUES FOR THEM TO DO THAT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE. I AM I. OUR PRIMARY OFFICE IS THERE IS I OUTSIDE CIVILIAN INVESTIGATION. BUREAU THAT REVIEWS EVERY INTERNAL AFFAIRS CASE PARTICIPATES IN THAT PROCESS ISSUES A REPORT. AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN COMPLAINT PROCEDURES FOR RECEIVING COMPLAINTS. THE CITY CAN RECEIVE COMPLAINTS AND THEY HAVE HOT LINES TO DO THAT OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN RECEIVE COMPLAINTS. AND THEY CAN BE CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS THAT THEN ALSO GET REFERRED OVER TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINTS INTERNAL AFFAIRS. HAS ITS OWN WEBSITE AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS FOR RECEIVING COMPLAINTS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CAN RECEIVE COMPLAINTS IN ORDER FOR THEM DR JOURNAL AFFAIRS. YOU HAVE ALSO THE LAWSUITS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE PANELISTS BUT FILING A CIVIL LAWSUIT IS NOT THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR INITIATING AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS COMPLAINT. IF THESE OTHER PROCESSES AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING COMPLICATED THERE'S NO LAWYER THAT'S NEEDED THERE'S NO COMPLAINT THAT HAS TO BE DRAFTED IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT AS SHORT. IN COMMON VERNACULAR EMAIL OR A TELEPHONE CALL AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY CHANGING LONG STANDING AND TRADITIONAL RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DO PROCESS AND FAIRNESS IN THE PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT HELPING. SOMEBODY GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING IF THE AGENCIES FOLLOW THE RULES ARE BASIC THINGS SUCH THAT YOU YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE RECORD YOUR INTERVIEW AND THAT YOU HAVE DUE PROCESS. THEN THERE IS NO VIOLATION AND WE'VE MADE MEANINGFUL REFORMS I WANT TO POINT YOU TO S. B. TWO S. B. TWO CREATES ANOTHER PATHWAY FOR CITIZENS TO FILE A COMPLAINT AND ANOTHER LAYER PUTS YOU. THROUGH POST INTRUSIVE BILLION ADVISORY PANELS THAT ONCE THEY RECEIVE THE COMPLAINT THEY MONITOR THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS COMPLAINT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND THEY EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT. THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION. SO ARE YOU NO I WOULD- RESPECTFUL JUST. THAT IN TERMS OF THERE BEING AN INABILITY FOR CITIZENS TO MAKE A COMPLAINT I YOU KNOW I'M MINDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE HESITANT TO COME FORWARD BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S NO PENALTY FOR SOMEONE MAKING A FALSE COMPLAINT AGAINST A PEACE OFFICER IN THIS STATE IN OTHER STATES THEY HAVE TO ATTEST UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY AND THERE'S POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL LIABILITY THAT IT CATCHES FOR MAKING A FALSE COMPLAINT. WE CAN'T WENT IT'S JUST ASSUMING THAT EVERY COMPLAINT IS TRUTHFUL OR EVEN IF SOMEBODY SINCERELY BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS MISCONDUCT. CAN L. CAN I CHIME IN ON A LITTLE BIT. AND DAVE THANK YOU FOR THAT WANT ONE THING I THINK THAT'S- REALLY MISSING HERE IS THE FACT THAT. IN VERY SMALL COMPLAINTS- YOU KNOW CITIZENS REALLY JUST WANT SOMEONE TO- TO LISTEN TO THEM THEY WANT THE FEEDBACK FROM FEEDBACK THAT WE DO GIVE FOLKS. IN THOSE- DOCUMENTS IS VERY VERY- SANITIZED AND VERY IT MINISTRY TO- DOESN'T REALLY SAY A LOT IT JUST SAYS THAT. YOU KNOW THE MISCONDUCT WAS SPOT ON FOUNDER FOUNDED IN THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY THE ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE. WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IN THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW- YES YOU KNOW USE YOUR CURFEW SET MY GRANDMOTHER ON THE CURB YOU KNOW- AND WE DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- AND WE WANT YOU KNOW WHAT THE OFFICERS OF THE DEPUTIES FIRED FOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS- OR WE SIMPLY JUST WANT THAT TO STOP AND- AND FOR YOU GUYS TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR. POLICING OUR COMMUNITY AND SO THERE REALLY HAS TO BE SOME FOLLOW UP DIALOGUE NOT ONLY WITH THE CHIEF WILL LEAD THAT BY EXAMPLE BUT ALSO WITH ALL THE SUBORDINATE SUPERVISORS THAT HE OR SHE SELECTS TO BE. YOUR LOCAL STATION COMMAND FOLKS YOU HAVE TO BE IN PRICING OF THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S THESE COMMUNITY BREAKDOWNS COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THAT. REALLY WORKS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TEND TO BE VERY VERY DEFENSIVE OF THEIR OFFICERS AND THEIR DEPUTIES. WHEN REALLY THERE SHOULD BE MORE DIALOGUE AND COMMUNICATION- WHERE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW GIVEN. THE CHANCE TO BE HEARD OUT. WE'RE GOING TO- MEMBER IF I COME LAST UP ON. REAL QUICK- TWO TWO. CHIEF RAMBO'S POINT ANTENNAS STAGG POINT THEY THERE ARE ALREADY. IN THE LOT PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO THE CAN- I WILL SAY WE THE DEPARTMENT CAN REPORT BACK TO THE COMPLAINANT IS LIMITED- BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE STATUTES- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE SAID BECAUSE- OFFICER RECORDS DO YOU. HAVE A CONFIDENTIALITY ATTACHED TO THEM BECAUSE OF THOSE STATUTES AND SO. TO THE TO THE CHIEFS POINT IT IS A RATHER SANITIZED VERSION WHICH CAN I THINK BEYOND SATISFYING IN SOME. TO SOME PEOPLE. A GREAT WAY TO GO TO- MR LACKEY. YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST. TO ONE ISSUE THAT'S NOT GETTING ANY DISCUSSION OF A DISCOVERY PLEASE MENTION. OF AYE MR IS NEGATIVE IT. AS FALSE COMPLAINTS YOU GOTTA REMEMBER AS- AS A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- COMPLAINTS ARE SERIOUS THING WITH MY SERIOUS AND THEY ARE DOCUMENTED AND THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY. BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL AGENCIES AND I THINK IT IS. A VERY DELICATE TOPIC BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS- A FALSE COMPLAINT. AND THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. WHO WANNA USE THE COMPLAINT PROCESS AS RETRIBUTION OR AS- A TOOL TO PUNISH AN OFFICER UNFAIRLY BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BROUGHT THEM IN TO CUSTODY. WERE A DISTURBING. AND I THINK THAT THERE. THERE IS THE REALITY THAT NEEDS TO AT LEAST BE CONSIDERED THAT- YOU DO HAVE. A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. THEY ALREADY HAVE MEANT AN ANIMUS BUT A BAD FEELING TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY ARE GOING TO USE THIS- PROCEDURE. IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS A FACT IT'S NOT A PREVAILING FACT BUT IT IS A FACT THAT- DESERVES. AT LEAST CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. THE FEMALE VOICE SO MARIO IS THAT YOUR VOICE IF YOU WANT TO CHIME IN. THAT WAS I WAS MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS TO PICK UP ON THAT PRIOR SENATE COMMENTS SO FIRST THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT SO. PARTLY IT DOES FALL TO CHIEFS TO ENGAGE BETTER WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES ACT THERE'S LOTS OF ROOM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO YOU DON'T REQUIRE AGENCIES TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. CURE A COMPLETE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAYBE DIDN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE CAP FOLLOW UP AND YOU CAN HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GET BACK IN TOUCH AND GIVE PEOPLEAN OPPORTUNITY. TO CARE- AND OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO ACT WEEKS A LOT THAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY GIVE PEOPLE ADEQUATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH THEIR COMPLAINT I GETTING THE SORT OF. SANITIZED DESCRIPTION OF YOU KNOW IT WAS UNFOUNDED AND WITHOUT ANY SORT OF EXPLANATION OF WHY OR WHAT OR WHAT HAPPENED AT REALLY DOES UNDERMINE ANY SORT OF FAITH IN THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS OF THIS DISTRICTS MUSIC CLEAR AREA WHERE THERE'S. MORE THAT CAN BE DONE LEGISLATIVELY. THANK YOU MUCH WANT TO GO. MY COLLEAGUE MCCARTY THIS COMMITTEE AND I WASN'T HERE AT THE OUTSET BUT I DID WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL I LISTEN TO ALL OF IT FROM THE BEGINNING ON MY PHONE- BUT- I REALLY WANTED TO YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW HALF A DOZEN OR SO- HEARINGS. AND NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BRINGING ABOUT REAL IDEAS AND SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WE PASSED WE TALKED ABOUT A YEAR AGO IN THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT. THE S. B. TWO ISSUE OF DECERTIFYING OFFICERS THAT CROSS THE LINE SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE A LOT IN CALIFORNIA AT HALFORD DOZEN OR SO BILLS I KNOW. YOU'RE A LANDMARK BILL ON THE CHOKE HOLD THE BILL WE WERE TELLING DR WHATEVER ON USE OF FORCE THAT YOU KNOW MY BILLS ON INDEPENDENT INSTIGATION SHERIFF OVERSIGHT- MISTER- HOLDEN'S BILL ON DUTY TO INTERVENE. AND BUT THE RECORDS BILLS THAT SKINNER HAS DONE TWICE THOSE ARE SOME RIP VERY SIGNIFICANT IN BRINGING ABOUT. FAIR POLICING TO BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITY SO WE HAVE TO A LOT- SOME OF THE ISSUES AND THESE BILLS. OVER ARCHING HABIT THE ISSUE OF THE PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS BETTER KHOBAR- AND I THINK THAT THE TWO OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE TALK ABOUT POPE ARE YEARS AGO. ON THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE WEEK OF THE WEEK THIS IS WORK- HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO BOUNCE AROUND. INVESTIGATIONS TRANSPARENCY WITH- WITH WITH WITH DISCIPLINE RECORDS- SO THOSE YOU KNOW HOW HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT- CHIEF ARAMBULA- TALKED ABOUT IN IN. EX TO GET IT TO HIS LESSON. THAT- WHEN THIS FIRST PUT INTO LAW IN CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY WAS IT SIGNED BY BY GOVERNOR BROWN BUT IT WAS. ENDORSED BY THE ACLU. AND SO AND IN OPPOSED BY BY THE CHIEFS AND SO. MINDFUL THAT SO I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY PROPOSED. IN WRITING THE BILL TO END PROBAR- MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL I DON'T I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT BUT- DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD MANDATE. RIGHT MAYBE THERE' CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IT LIKE EVERY OTHER THING SEACOR EVERY OTHER MAJOR DOCKING WE HAVE HERE IS A LIVING BREATHING THING. TIMES HAVE CHANGED IT'S BEEN UTILIZED DIFFERENTLY- BYE BYE WHETHER THEY'RE- INDIVIDUAL- JURISDICTION THROUGH THEIR CONTRACTS IN THEIR- THAT MIGHT USE WITH THEIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY- I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- I'D I'D I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE. AS FAR AS ONE OF OUR PANELISTS HERE. THE ACLU- DID MENTIONED EARLY ON- SO I HAVE TWO ISSUES I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MISTER- ONE IS THE STATUE LIMITATIONS ISSUE. AND ONE IS HOW THIS RELATES TO ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES WHICH WAS WHICH WAS SUGGESTED. SO FIRST- I WE'VE HEARD DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THE ISSUE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS- THE SPEAKER REPRESENTING THE- LEIBER AT LAW FIRM WHO WORKS WITH AGENCIES- TALKED ABOUT- THE FLAWS IN IN IN THE- EXEMPTIONS FOR POTENTIAL TOLLING WHERE THERE ARE SOME WILL SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THERE WON'T BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HOLD. INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WRONGDOING- YEP OF COURSE THAT THE IT THE ATTORNEY FOR- OUR LOCAL PEACE OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I BELIEVE CORRECT CALIFORNIA- MISTER MISS STAGNATE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE THINKS THAT IT'S SUFFICIENT I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR MR MISDIAGNOSIS- THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE THE FLAW HER EITHER YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE HARM. IF THE STATUE LIMITATIONS WAS CHANGED FROM A YEAR TO TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS. OR ANY CHANGE AT ALL WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL PUBLIC POLICY HARM IN YOUR EYES. I THINK THAT IT. THE CURRENT LAW STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE AND- MISTER CARTY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW MY PRESENTATION I DID IMPAIRING THE STATUTES BUT IT RUNS FROM WHEN SOMEBODY MAKES A COMPLAINT NOT% FROM WHEN THE CONDUCT OCCURRED SO IN PRACTICE IT'S NOT ONE YEAR FROM WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IT'S ONE YEAR FROM WHEN THE AGENCY WAS MADE AWARE OF THE MISCONDUCT AND FRANKLY I THINK IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT AND AN AGENCY WANTS TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE YEAR. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT OFFICERS FIT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND IT'S IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT THAT INVESTIGATION IS TIMELY COMPLETED AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT BANNED THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT IT'S BEEN THE REALLY MINOR STUFF WHERE AGENCIES BLOW IT OFF BECAUSE THEY WHATEVER THEY'RE TRIAGING OF THEY DON'T THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S LIKE MISSING QUARTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE CAREER THREATENING BUT JUST FROM A GOOD EMPLOYER STANDPOINT IF YOU'VE GOT AN EMPLOYEE. THAT'S PERFORMING AT A DEFICIENT LEVELS TO PUT THAT EMPLOYEE ON NOTICE WHETHER IT'S MCDONALD'S WHETHER IT'S A POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT. THEY'RE NOT MEETING STANDARDS AND THAT YOU NEED TO GET UP TO STANDARDS AND GO THROUGH PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE IT DOES NOBODY ANY GOOD TO JUST LET THINGS LINGER FOR A BEYOND A YEAR. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE AN AGENCY WOULDN'T BE ABLETO DO IT I'VE NEVER SEEN IN MY TWENTY TWO YEARS OF PRACTICE. A SERIOUS ALLEGATION AND LIKE A USE OF FORCE OR A SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ANYTHING THAT'S COVERED BY S. B. TWO WERE THE DISCLOSURE STATUTES. GO BEYOND A YEAR IT'S BEEN MINOR STUFF SO YOUR ARGUMENT THAT. BY THE HARD YOU'RE SAYING IF IT WENT TO TWO YEARS. OR GREATER IT WOULD BE YEAH THE CLOUD OVER. THE STATE THE OFFICERS HEAD WHO'S ACCUSED ACCUSED OF THIS BILL WILL I'M TRYING TO SAY I. HAD A KLAY IT HASN'T HAPPENED BUT WHAT. WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE FOR PEOPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT IF IT WAS EXTENDED. SO FROM THAT FROM NOW I WAS TALKING FROM THE PUBLIC'S PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU FOR THAT FROM THE OFFICER'S PERSPECTIVE IT DOES HANG OVER YOUR CLOUT. AT CLOUD HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS AND NIGHT THAT OFFICER HERE SHE IS TYPICALLY NOT ELIGIBLE TO GET ANY KIND OF SPECIALTY ASSIGNMENT NOT ELIGIBLE- TO PROMOTE OR ADVANCEMENT AND IT CAN'T BE FRANKLY USED AND I'M- EXCLUDING CHIEF RAMBO HERE. OF COURSE BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD SHE'S IN THERE ARE SOME BAD MANAGERS THAT WILL MISUSE THE ABILITY TO DO THESE THINGS AND SO THEY KNOW THAT DATE YOU KNOWS FOR INSTANCE THAT AN ALLEGATION IS UNWARRANTED. BUT HOLDEN OVER THE OFFICER'S HEAD INDEFINITELY SO THAT THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY BLACKBALLED AND YOU MAYBE PUSH THEM OUT OF THE AGENCY BECAUSE THEIR CAREERS DAD THEY CAN'T GET INTO A SPECIALTY ASSIGNMENT THAT COULD LEAD TO A PROMOTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF MY EXECUTOR WHO HAD A GAG ORDER IN A CLOUD PUT OVERSIGHT SIMPLY FOR FILING A GRIEVANCE- ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER WHEN HE WAS A POLICE CAPTAIN. AND SO I THINK THERE'S AN INTEREST ON BOTH SIDES IN HAVING THESE MATTERS RESOLVED TIMELY AND THEY REALLY THAT WOULD MAKE AN AGENCY UNABLE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION IF THE COMPLAINANT DOESN'T WANT TO COME FOR A WITNESS DOESN'T WANT TO COME FORWARD. EIGHT THEY'RE NOT GONNA COME FORWARD I MEAN NOBODY CAN CONTROL THAT BUT WHAT THE AGENCY CAN CONTROL IS THAT THEY CAN CONTROL THE TIMING OF REACHING OUT TO THOSE WITNESSES. THEY CAN CONTROL THE TIMING OF THE INTERROGATION OF THE OFFICER WHO'S THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND ONE THING THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS. UNDER S. B. TWO IN THIS IS SOMETHING KORAC ADVOCATED FOR THE EMPLOYING AGENCY HAS TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION EVEN IF AN OFFICER LEAVES AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT THERE IS A FINAL DETERMINATION. BOB AND THAT NOT SURE IF IT'S TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO OR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE ENOUGH TO REFER TO THE STATUTE. BUT I IS GOING TO BE COMING INTO EFFECT IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST FROM THE LABOR SIDE IN WANTING TO HAVE. TIMELY CONCLUSION OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND IF AN OFFICER. YOU KNOW ISN'T FIT FOR DUTY AND FOR THE JOB THEN APPROPRIATE ACTION BE TAKEN BUT NOT HAVE IT LINGER FOREVER AND THE PUBLIC DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE BEEN. THERE FOREVER. IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT. DONE SOMETHING JUST. THEM FROM CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT BUT THEY'RE DOING THINGS THAT A SUB STANDARD WAY. THEN THEY SHOULD BE PUT ON NOTICE AND THEY SHOULD BE CORRECTED TIMELY I MEAN I USE THE EXAMPLE OF. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT FOR REPORT WRITING WELL IF YOU WAIT OVER A YEAR TO TELL THEM THAT THEY NEED TO FIX IT OR TAKE REMEDIAL MEASURES. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE WRITING A YEAR'S WORTH OF POOR REPORTS AND THAT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT ANSWER ON THAT AND MISTER MCCARTY TO MR. HE YES FOR YEARS AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO SCHEDULED. A TURN ATTORNEY HARRIS HERE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY YOU KNOW MISTER MISS STAGNATE FOR ALL OF HIS BRILLIANCE IN HIS PRESENTATION. REPRESENTING WHAT THE- WE TALKED ABOUT THE PUBLIC THE COMMUNITY IF YOU WILL. I REPRESENT A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THAT COMMUNITY. I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE LIKE THE MOTHER OF DEJAN FLINTOFF WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN SACRAMENTO. AND IT TOOK HER E. MOION ONLY. MONTHS BEFORE SHE COULD GET UP THE COURAGE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT BRINGING A COMPLAINT BOARD ON BEHALF OF HER DEAD SON WHO WAS SHOT DEAD. AND LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREETS IN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS IN A CLEAN AND NEAT PROCESS FOR EVERYBODY. IF WE TALK ABOUT. THE HOUSE COULD BE UNITY YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF COMPLEXITIES YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IN TERMS OF THEM BEING ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. YOU'VE GOT TO WORK THROUGH THE TIME PROCESS SO WHILE I AYE AND SHARE YOUR OPINION. THAT YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD HANGING OVER THE HEAD OF THE OFFICER. BY THE SAME TOKEN. ALL ASPECTS OF OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THE TYPES OF FOLKS WHO TEND TO BE VICTIMIZED. IT TAKES SEVERAL MONTHS FOR A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN COMPLAIN ABOUT THESE SORTS OF THINGS. AND FINALLY I'LL SAY THIS. I ALWAYS CHECK MY HEAD AND SCRATCH MY BROWS. FURROW MY BROW OVER THE THOUGHT THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY WHO THE BAD ACTORS IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE. YOU CAN GO IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE COMMUNITY IF YOU WILL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ASK THE FOLKS IN THE KNOW WHO THE BAD COPS ARE IN TERMS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR WHO HAS A PATTERN AND PRACTICE. OF BEHAVIOR THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY THAT IS IMPRESSIVE THAT IS VIOLENT. AND THEY CAN SHOW YOU RIGHT WHO THEY ARE AND GIVE YOU CHAPTER AND VERSE TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME AGAIN SO. THIS ISN'T AS. DIFFICULT AS ONE WOULD MAKE IT OUT TO BE WHAT. DIFFICULT IS BEING ABLE TO GET P. TO FEEL CALM. TO FEEL SEEN. TO PROUD. AND BRING IN THE ALLEN. FOR THANK YOU RETURNS WE GO TO MISTER CARTER TO FINISH. YEAH THANK I WANTED. ASK AT. HERE AND THIS. AND SO. YEAH MISTER MISS DOWNEY SAYS IN HIS RIGHT. HE DOESN'T SEE ANY. A CASE THAT THE STATUE LIMIT. WITHIN AN ISSUE. HE SAYS- YOU IF THEY'RE AN IN. THAT HAPPENED AT THE IT'S THAT LOOKED ONE YOUR STATURE THE START UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION STARTS. I'M SURE THERE'S PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS OR THE AC THAT CAN POINT TO OTHER EXAMPLES WERE. THE CITY MAY HAVE. DRAGGED THEIR FEET. ALLOW THE ONE YEAR CLOCK TO TECH AND- AN OFFICER. WHO YOU KNOW WAS ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING OR DID DO SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE IN A COMMUNITY. NEVER FACED ANY CONSEQUENCES SO. MISTER SHELDON DID TALK ABOUT HE WHAT HE VIEWS AS HIS. FEELINGS ON SHORTCOMINGS OF THE OF THE ONE YEAR. STATUE IMITATION SO COULD WE HAVE MISTER SHELDON. TALK A BIT MORE ON THIS ISSUE AND YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SURE THE CONCERN I GUESS I HAVE WOULD BE WHEN DOES THE STATUE LIMITATIONS START RUNNING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE- IT'S AN EASY CALL WHEN A WRITTEN COMPLAINT IS SUBMITTED FROM- FROM CITIZEN- AND- TO MR MISTIMED POINTLESS THE P. O. B. R. STATURE LIMITATIONS DOES NOT START RUNNING SO THERE IS NO IMPEDIMENT TO HOLDING THE OFFICER ACCOUNTABLE. UNTIL THERE IS SOME SORT OF NOTIFICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT THE- HI ROB IF YOU WILL IS THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE THERE IS INFORMATION THAT USUALLY HAPPENS IN THE SCENARIO WHERE THE INFORMATION COMES TO US A SUPERVISOR OFFICER A SERGEANT. WHO IT CAN END UP THE PAID ROVERS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CASE AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO READ IT IT'S A GOOD. TEACHING TOOL I THINK ON THIS POINT. BUT THE INFORMATION COMES INTO A SUPERVISOR WHO NEEDS TO LOOK INTO SOME THINGS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MISCONDUCT EVEN OCCURRED OR NOT- WHETHER THIS IS A REAL COMPLAINT OR NOT- AND THEN WHO THE OFFICER MIGHT BE AND IN THE PAPER OKAY USE. THE LAPD HAD TO DO SOME DIGGING INTO TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW THE OFFICER WAS IN A PARTICULAR PATROL CAR AND IT TOOK HIM TEN OR ELEVEN DAYS TO DO THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE ULTIMATELY MISS THE STATUE LIMITATIONS JUST BY A MATTER OF A DAY OR TWO- AND THE COURT ULTIMATELY HELD IS WHAT THE WHAT THE COURT ULTIMATELY HOME THE PEDRO CASE WAS. THE DEPARTMENT WAS ON INQUIRY NOTICE. AND SO IT SHOULD UPS. DOES THIS OF STATURE WITH. WAS OR ELEVEN DAYS EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE SERGEANT. SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT. HE NEEDED% TO START LOOKING INTO WHO THE INDIVIDUAL WAS AND HE WAS REALLY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR IF YOU WILL NOT. WIN THE AND THE MATTER WAS ULTIMATELY. ASSIGNED TO AN INVESTIGATOR ONCE FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD BE A THE OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT WAS. AND SO I GUESS MY MAIN CONCERN WOULD BE ON THAT KIND OF. IS THE AREAS OF THE WHAT I CALL PRE INVESTIGATION BIASA- SUPERVISING- OFFICER WHERE THEY LOOK INTO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT SURE YET IF MISCONDUCT EVEN OCCURRED OR IF IT DID WHO WHO DID IT- WHO DID THE MISCONDUCT. YEAH IF THAT STARTS TO **** A MAGICIAN STARTS THE STATUE LIMITATIONS THAT CAN HELP. THE COMPANY IN A FAX AND WE DO COUNCIL OR OUR CLIENTS- ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION IN THESE AREAS. YOU KNOW WAS ONE OF THE FIRST- INFORMATION COMING TO THE AGENCY BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW ALL- IN WE DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW A SERGEANT RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AND DIDN'T. TELL ANYBODY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO. I THINK. IT THERE'S TWO WAYS OF. IT ONE IS ADDRESS THE LENGTH TIME BUT ALSO GIVING AND PERHAPS MORE CLARITY ON WHEN THE STARTING OF THE STATUE LIMITATIONS ACTUALLY. TAKES OFF OKAY THANK YOU AND LASTLY. MISTER CHAIR COMING GO TO PROFESSOR. NUMBER RANKO. AND ASK HER. TO QUESTIONS. WHAT ONE. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE IMPEDIMENTS IN CALIFORNIA IS- IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE YEAR AND WHAT WAS JUST NOTICE BUT WHEN IT STARTS INTO- IS THERE. IS THERE- BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER STATES AS FAR AS THIS IS THIS AND- IS THIS A NORMAL PRACTICE OR IN OTHER STATES AS THE- STATUE LIMITATIONS MUCH LONGER. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I THINK ON THE FIRST POINT THE CONCERN REALLY IS AROUND THESE AND BIG US AT NOTIFICATIONS AT SO. IT'S WHEN THEY SEE ACT EITHER ISN'T SURE YOU KNOW WHO THE OFFICER IS A CASE IN CALIFORNIA THAT MADE CLEAR THAT ONCE THEY'RE PUT ON NOTICE THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S- ON THE BALL BACK STARTS. TO RUN AT AND SO I THINK CLARIFYING THAT AMBIGUITY WOULD PROBABLY GO. A LONG WAY ON THIS FIRST AND SHE'S LIMITATIONS MEAN HONESTLY THEY'VE VERY QUITE A BIT. LIMITATIONS SOME AGENCIES ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED AWAY EVEN SHORTER ONES UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS OUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE YOU KNOW EGREGIOUSLY SHORT AB I THINK THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS SOMETHING IN THAT TWO TO THREE YEAR RANGE THAT WOULD GET YOU KNOW ADEQUATE SPACE FOR AGENCIES TO COMPLETE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS- IN THOSE KIND OF CASES WHERE IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO REALLY FIGURE OUT. WHAT HAPPENED I JUST WANNA MAKE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON RANDY RIGHT SO WE WANT EACH OF THESE TO DO THIS QUICKLY WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO BE ANGRY WITH THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IF THEY'RE DRAGGING THEIR FEET. AT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN AGENCY FAILS THAT I INVESTIGATE SOMETHING WITHIN A ONE YEAR LIMIT AND IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFICER GETS OFF THE HOOK AT THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO SEE A PROBLEM AND THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER MECHANISMS FOR ENSURING THAT AGENCIES. DO THIS WHILE INCLUDING APPS CITY COUNCIL OVERSIGHT NAY OR OVERSIGHT AND OTHER MECHANISMS FUNDING. AT TO SPEED THINGS ALONG. YES JUST CONCLUDING COMMENTS ON THIS- YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO BE LOOKING AT SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM BUT- I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK I KNOW ENOUGH NOW THAT WE KNOW ENOUGH I KNOW THAT. YET THAT. YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TOURNEY THIS MISDIAGNOSIS AS NOT A PROBLEM EVERYTHING'S GOODNESS FRONT- BUT IF THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OFFICERS THAT THAT SKATED ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT THE CLOCK THAT'S WRONG. I THINK THAT'S WRONG FOR EVERYBODY MAKES THE GOOD OFFICERS LOOK BAD AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WORTHY OF EXPLORATION. AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'LL LOOK INTO- BUT THANK YOU MISTER GETS THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU A PROFESSOR PALMER WRINKLE- I WANT TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. OF SINCE YOU'RE STILL HERE AND APPRECIATE YOU GUYS STAYING WITH US. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. I KNOW THAT MISTER MISS STAGNATE TALKED ABOUT. HIS PRESENTATION WAS THAT WHICH WAS I OPENING HE TALKED ABOUT THE IN OUR BE- NOT- THERE'S NO IN OUR BE. PROCESS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES- IN THE LOOK AT THE WHOLE BAR ITSELF- AND THEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF MAYBE I'LL ASK THE QUESTION SO IT LOOKS WHY DO YOU DON'T THINK THAT WE THAT THE POLICE AT THAT SCARES ME YEP. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HAVE SUCH AN IN R. V. IN RB- PROCESS WITH AND BECAUSE THESE ARE UNION THIS IS I'M OF THE POLICE OFFICERS- PULL BAR IS IT'S THE SAME THING- GIVING EMPLOYEES RIGHTS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER UNION A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT RIGHT- ONE IS SET FOR PRIVATE AND ONE IS THAT THE PUBLIC. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF POLICING AND THERE PIECE OFF THE BILL OF RIGHTS- DO YOU THINK THAT IN ARE BEING COULD BE US A GOOD PLACE. FOR THEM TO END UP DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. ARE YOU FOLLOWING THE- I AM AT SO YOU KNOW THIS GOES A LITTLE BIT BEYOND MY EXPERTISE I'M NOT A LABOR LAWYER I WRITE ABOUT POLICING MINISTER GOVERNMENT MORE BROADLY- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND MR AT STAGNATE IT SAY THAT YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAVE KIND OF AN ANALOGOUS AT SIDE OF PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEE RIGHT- I THINK THE QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO REALLY FOCUS ON IS ACT HOW THE SORTS OF RIGHTS PLAY OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF POLICING PARTICULARLY THIS KIND OF OVERLAP BETWEEN INVESTIGATIONS AND SUPERVISION. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW ONCE A COMPLAINT IS FILED AND THERE'S A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AGAINST AN OFFICER A LOT OF THE RATES THAT KICK IN WITH WILL BARTON MAKE A LOT. OF SENSE. ONE OF THE CAN COMES IN FOR THE GRAY AREA WHERE YOU KNOW SUPERVISE. HERE IS THAT SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED ON THE SHIFT AND THEY- GO OUTSIDE YOUNG TALK TO AN OFFICER AND THERE'S A BIG YOU IDIOTS THAT YOU KNOW IS THIS JUST SUPERVISION IS THE- THING THAT REALLY FALLS UNDER. POOL BAR AT AND YOU KNOW GIVEN THE NATURE POLICING AND THAT. ROLE IMPORTANT FOR ALL LOOKS. I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS OVER LIKE RIGHT AS THEY LEAD INTO SUPERVISION. IS THAT. CORRECT BARRIERS TO KIND OF SUPERVISION AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH TRACTION IN. THE CONTEXT OF YEAH. THE BUS DRIVER YOUR OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES AND SO THE IMPACT OF RIGHTS MIGHT JUST BE DIFFERENT PLEASE CONTACT. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE ACTUALLY FROM THE CHIEF MIGHT BE IN THE BEST POSITION TO KIND OF SPEAK TO THAT AND- THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE SEES AS- AN APARTMENT. GREAT BECAUSE- AGAIN WE'RE- LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN FACT HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN AGREEMENT YOU YOUR RIGHTS. JUST LIKE- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A- IS A LABOR IF YOU WILL- A STATE- IT'S NOT A RIGHT TO WORK STATE AND SO WE BELIEVE IN A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND SO- WE HAVE THESE COLLECTIVE BARGAIN AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT THE EMPLOYEE- AND WITHOUT THAT WE WOULD SEE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES AS RELATES TO- WHAT WE BELIEVE UNJUST TERMINATIONS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BECAUSE- THERE. ISN'T SUCH IN PLACE. I WANT TO ASK. MR STAGNANT QUESTION IN YOUR PRESENTATION SIR YOU TALKED ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. CAN YOU GIVE US EXAMPLES OF WHAT- SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. WOULD- KICK INTO PLACE- UNDER A PEACE OFFICER'S BILL OF RIGHTS. GIVE US SITUATIONS THAT THIS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY. BE IMPLEMENTED. SO IF UNDERSTAND QUESTION QUESTION. IT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF LIKE THE TOLLING AGREEMENT FOR EXAMPLE. WHATEVER ALLEGATIONS MISCONDUCT IS GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THESE BASIC PROCEDURAL RIGHTS ABOUT NOTICE AND HAVING AN ATTORNEY THERE IF THERE'S A LIGHT SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT LIKE I USE THAT FOR SIR USED TO DEADLY FORCE THERE'S GONNA BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THAT IS GONNA TAKE PRIMARY OVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION NONE OF THE POPE OUR RIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE A PLAY ON THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND ALL OF THE TIME ON DAY ONE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS GONNA PULL WHILE THAT'S GOING ON. SO THE DISTINCTION THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT ON SOMETHING SERIOUS IT'S GONNA GET INVESTIGATED RIGHT AWAY. THE ONE INSTANCE I CAN RECALL OF THERE EVER BEING A VIOLATION OF THE ONE YEAR TIME LIMITATION IT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER SHELDON WAS DESCRIBING IT WAS A SITUATION WHERE I OFFICER WAS IN AN ACCIDENT REPORTED TO HIS SUPERVISOR WHO REPORTED TO THE TRAFFIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. TO LOOK INTO IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN THEY WERE REFERRED OVER TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND THE DEPARTMENT SAID OKAY YOU'RE FROM INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THEY WERE GLUED TO TIME BY A MONTH. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IN THE SENSE THAT AN OFFICER IS GOING TO GET FIRED WHAT THERE'S ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT ON DUTY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE I WOULD ASK I MEAN IT'S ALL OF THESE IS WHY WAIT TILL THE LAST DAY ON A YEAR IF THERE'S AN OFFICER THAT HAS AN ISSUE WITH THEIR DRIVING YOU SHOULD REMEDY IT IMMEDIATELY OR AT LEAST IN A TIMELY FASHION AND I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION. AND IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR AND YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT ON THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR FROM WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF THIS STATUTE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TAKE THAT STATUE AWAY. THEN THEY'LL JUST GET AROUND TO IT WHENEVER THEY GET AROUND TO IT MAYBE IT'S TWO YEARS LATER MAYBE THREE YEARS LATER AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO DISCIPLINE SOMEBODY FOR GETTING IN A CHARGEABLE- ACCIDENT ON DUTY THREE YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENS. WHAT I MEAN MY SANITY OFTEN GET RETRAINED IN A IN A PROMPT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SO THAT'S THE MAIN DISTINCTION THAT THAT I'M TALKING. ABOUT ON TERMS OF WHAT HOW I WOULD DEFINE A SERIES. MISCONDUCT I THINK THEY- THE- IS DONE A JOB THAT. THROUGH THE HAD THE PENAL CODE HAS BEEN AMENDED NOW WITH SB SIXTEEN AND THERE'S A DEFINITION OF WHAT ARE SERIOUS- I'M MISCONDUCT SB TWO ALSO. HAS A LITTLE BIT LESS REFINED BUT PRETTY SIMILAR TYPE DEFINITIONS. I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AN OFFICER THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL IS MAYBE. NOT THE ONLY BRIGHT LINE BUT IS A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT VERSES THERE'S THINGS ARE JUST PERFORMANCE ISSUES. YOU'RE NOT DRIVING GREAT YOU'RE NOT INVESTIGATING GREAT- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PUNCTUALITY PROBLEM THOSE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN EVERY PROFESSION. AND YOU DON'T FIRE SOMEBODY FROM PROSECUTING FORM BUT YOU TAKE CORRECTIVE MEASURES HEY YOU NEED TO START SHOWING UP TO WORK ON TIME. I MEAN IF I HAD AN EMPLOYEE THAT WAS SHOWING UP PARTY EVERY DAY I WOULDN'T WAIT A YEAR. TO TELL THEM THAT THEY NEED TO DO IMPROVE THEIR ATTENDANCE. SO WHAT I'M HEARING. JUST FOR THE PUBLIC EDUCATION IS THAT- PULL BAR KICKSTAND- JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED. IF A POLICE OFFICER GETS IN THE ACCIDENT- THERE'S A VESTED GEISHA- HE HAS TO HAVE UNION REPRESENTATION HE HAS PULLED MARKETS IS INVOKED. IN THAT PARTICULAR SCENARIO HOWEVER WHEN THEY'RE- ADULTS. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO BROAD THE STATUTE ACTUALLY DEFINES IT. IT'S WHEN THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF MISCONDUCT OR QUESTIONING REALLY ON THAT ON THE PROCEDURAL PARKS WHEN THERE'S A QUESTIONING BY A SUPERVISOR. THAT COULD LEAD TO DISCIPLINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SUPERVISOR SILVA SUPERVISOR IS GOING TO AN OFFICER IN ST- HEY YOU'RE DOING THAT. YOU'RE A CRUMMY JOB REPORT WRITING I'M NOT GONNA DISCIPLINE HIM SHOULD TELL YOU TO DO BETTER. THAN KHOBAR DOESN'T EVEN COME INTO PLAY THEY HAVE OR THAT'S JUST A ROUTINE COUNSELING AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT. IT'S ONLY WHEN DISCIPLINE IS IN THE PICTURE IS. A LAYMAN'S WAY OF SAYING IT AND IT'S FROM THE SUPERVISORS PERSPECTIVE IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE OFFICER FOR POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE. THEN THEY HAVE TO PAY THE OFFICER LOOKING AT. YOU FOR POTENTIAL DISAPPOINTED YOU CAN WRAP YOUR CAN RECORDED XTERRA. SB FORMAL DISCIPLINE FOR YOU KNOW NINETY. GROW BIGGEST AND SO I'M GOING YOU CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THINK SOME PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC WOULD THINK THAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO A POLICE OFFICER AND- ALLEGATION OF THE USE OF FORCE OR DEADLY FORCE THEN THEY BELIEVE SOME HURT SO I HEAR THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT POLL OF OUR KICKSTAND AND PROVIDES THESE RIGHTS- THAT. SOMEHOW WOULD GIVE THEM THE UPPER HAND OR PEOPLE ARE SILENT OR ON THE INVESTIGATION IS NOT HERE TO LIKE IT NORMALLY WOULD SO I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO CREATE THOSE TWO DISTINCTIONS SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO- USE OF FORCE AND- DEADLY FORCE THEN PULL BARS NOT INVOKED- INVESTIGATORS COME. THEY DO A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE SITUATION BUT AS YOU DESCRIBED AGAIN PAUL BARK IS THIS LIKE IF A PERSON IS BEING CALLED INTO- YOUR BOSS'S OFFICE AND A BOSS WANT TO PROVIDE DISCIPLINE THE PERSON HAS TO HAVE TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE REPRESENTATION THE PERSON HAVE A RIGHT TO. HAVE CERTAIN THINGS UNDER THAT PARTICULAR PER VIEW- THAT POTENTIALLY COULD LEAD TO DISCIPLINE FROM A COMMANDING OFFICER AND OR A BOSS IS THAT CORRECT. YOU NAILED IT MISTER CHAIRMAN WHEN THERE'S THAT WHEN THERE'S LIKE A USE OF DEADLY FORCE IT IS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT POPE OURS NOT EVEN IN THE PICTURE YOU TYPICALLY ARE GONNA HAVE TO DESCRIPTOR ANNE'S OFFICE. LOOKING AT THAT IF IT'S A FIFTEEN OH SIX CASE THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE LOOKING AT IT. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION- SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHATEVER THAT. THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE JURISDICTIONS THAT OCCURRED AND NONE OF THESE RIGHTS APPLY THE ONLY WAY THAT ANY OF THAT PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS WOULD COME INTO PLAY. IS IT AFTER THAT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SEPARATE FROM THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO CHARGE THE OFFICER THE AGENCY DECIDES TO FIRE THE OFFICER THEN THE APPEAL RIGHTS KICK IN BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THEY'RE NOT THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF SUBSTANCE ON THE APPEAL RIGHTS IN THAT. IN THE STATUTE IT'S REALLY JUST RECOGNIZING SKELLY AND THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. WHICH WE HAVE IN THIS STATE KIND OF CIRCLE ALL THE WAY BACK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE NLRB WHY IT MAKES SENSE IN MY VIEW TO HAVE REPRESENTATION RIGHTS AND CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TAMMANY HALL YOU DON'T HAVE DECISIONS BEING MADE BASED ON NEPOTISM OR CORRUPTION. AND THAT YOU HAVE VARIANCE I MEAN I COR THESE ARE ACTUALLY ANTI DISCRIMINATION STATUTES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS TREATED THE SAMEAND THAT THERE IS A FAIR. AND IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION AND THAT EVERYBODY. IS AFFORDED DUE PROCESS. I REMEMBER WHEN I WORKED YOU TELL A AND- REPRESENTING TEACHERS. WE HAD SKELLY HEARINGS AND SCALY RIGHTS AND WE HAD THOSE- THE GIVES OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH SIDES TO. MAKE PRESENTATION BUT MOST OF ALL. IN THAT YOU HAD REPRESENTATION YOU HAD UNION REPRESENTATION- A REUNION LAWYER OR REPRESENTATIVE SUCH AS MYSELF TO GO THERE AND- ARGUE- IN SUPPORT OF THAT UNION MEMBER AGAIN I THINK THAT'S WHAT. MAKES US GREAT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DEFEND AN EMPLOYEE- MR LACKEY MR MCCARTY. YOU HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS WHY HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. HELLO MISTER SHELDON- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN BEFORE I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. WE WANT YOU CONVERSATION AS WELL. YEAH JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THOSE. A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS SERIOUS MISCONDUCT- S. B. TO DO IT- GIVE US SOME DEFINITIONS STATUTORY DEFINITIONS THAT WILL BE PART OF THAT BILL THAT I BELIEVE MANY DEPARTMENTS ARE IF THEY DON'T ALREADY AYE MOST OF THEM DO INCORPORATE THOSE INTO THEIR POLICY MANUALS AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS- SIGNIFICANT MISCONDUCT AND- KNOW IT IT CAN POST WILL BE ISSUING IS MY UNDERSTANDING AS PART OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL BE ISSUING FURTHER REGULATIONS WHICH WILL. FURTHER DEFINE WHAT IS TO BE CONSIDERED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. IN THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ALL MEAN WHAT HAS TO BE REPORTED TO POST- BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE EVEN DRESSED QUITE A BIT OF THIS ALREADY WITH SB TWO- SOME OF THE THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITHIN POP ARE- S. B. TWO ARE IN MY ESTIMATION IT AS ADDRESSED QUITE A QUITE A BIT OF THOSE- THAT THE THEM YET AGAIN THE MAIN CONCERN I HAVE FOR MY FOR MY CHIEFS PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WILL OR AT LEAST THIRTY VISOR TO ACHIEVE. IS THAT GRAY AREA- OF THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE SUPERVISOR IS LOOKING INTO- POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT THERE NOW AND I DO AGREE WITH MISTER MISDIAGNOSIS TYPICALLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THOSE HIGH PROFILE OBVIOUS MISCONDUCT USE OF FORCE- SHOOTING TYPE SITUATION SO IT'S THE OTHER STUFF- AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S YOU. IT COMES UP WHEN THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OR HONESTY OF AN OFFICER AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE IT PLAY OUT AND WHERE IT CAN BE ON THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES CAN PLAY PLAY THEMSELVES OUT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE A QUESTION WHOEVER LIKE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION OR DRESS IT WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONING OFFICERS DURING AN INVESTIGATION WHO OVERSEES THE QUESTIONS AND HOW. ARE THEY EVALUATE IT. WHEN IT COMES TO QUESTIONING OFFICERS DURING AN INVESTIGATION WHO OVERSEES THE QUESTIONS. AND HOW ARE THEY EVALUATE IT. I COULD TAKE A STAB AT THAT SURE THERE THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE COMPLETELY THE PURVIEW OF THE EMPLOYING AGENCY AND THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATORS IN SO THE OFFICER DOESN'T GET A PREVIEW OF THE QUESTIONS THAT NOTICE INFORMATION IS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IT'S AT A VERY VERY HIGH LEVEL AID TYPICALLY IS YOU ONE OR TWO SENTENCES YOU KNOW YOU'D USED EXCESSIVE FORCE. DURING THE ARREST OF SUSPECT OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW BY THEIR NAME WITH THE REPORT NUMBER SO THE OFFICER KNOWS WHAT THE INCIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT AND THEN ONCE THEY GET IN THERE ANYTHING THAT'S WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THAT COMPLAINT OR THAT INCIDENT. IS ESSENTIALLY FAIR GAME AND THE INVESTIGATORS IT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND SOPHISTICATION OF THE OF THE AGENCY BUT MOST AGENCIES ARE AT LEAST MEDIUM OR LARGE SIZE HAVE ARE PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE VERY SKILLED AT- ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEVELOPING QUESTIONS. ARE BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS THE EMPLOYING AGENCY HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THAT. IF AN OFFICER REFUSES TO ANSWER A QUESTION. THEY CAN BE TERMINATED FOR INSUBORDINATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEDIA ALSO CHIME IN A LITTLE BIT ON THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN AND I INVESTIGATOR AND THE SUPERVISOR OF AYE INVESTIGATORS IS. THE QUALITY OF THE QUESTIONS USUALLY ARE ARE OVER SEEN BY A SUPERVISOR- IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE REALLY CAUTION OUR INVESTIGATORS ON ARE. ASKING LEADING QUESTIONS WE LIKE THE NASCO YOU KNOW OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS- WE ALSO. WELCOME TO ASPEN CIVICALLY DID YOU DO A LOT YOU KNOW RATHER THAN THAN BEAT AROUND THE BUSH- AND SO THAT THE QUALITY OF THE QUESTION LOOKING AT DEPENDING ON THE ALLEGATIONS. ARE SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW USUALLY AS IS DISCUSSED I HAD A TIME SO THAT YOU CAN TAILOR YOUR YOUR INVESTIGATION TO REALLY GET TO THE CRUX OF THE ACTUAL ALLEGATION. AND NOT VEER TOO FAR OFF INTO SPECULATION AND OTHER ISSUES. LIMIT LIMIT HAVE A FOLLOW QUESTION SHOULD A THIRD PARTY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE QUESTIONS. SHOULD A THIRD PARTY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE QUESTIONS. I DON'T IS VERY BROAD BUT IT DOES NOT. PLEASE IF YOU'RE ASKING LIKE SHOULD THERE BE JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT. I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHAT OFTEN NOT OFTEN- MOST INVESTIGATORS DO A GOOD JOB TO BE FAIR BUT SOMETIMES THEY ASK WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS BEYOND THE SCOPE OR DELVING INTO- PERSONAL MATTERS THAT ARE. FAR AFIELD FROM WHAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION OR ASK FOR LEGAL CONCLUSIONS OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND I A INVESTIGATION IS NOT A COURT OF LAW IT'S NOT A DEPOSITION I DON'T REPRESENTING OFFICER I CAN MAKE AN OBJECTION ON THE RECORD BUT I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSTRUCT THE OFFICER NOT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. OR TO GO GET A JUDGE% HAS- DISCOVERY RAFFERTY LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEPOSITION- TWO. TO INTERJECT ON HERE AND SO IF I INSTRUCT MY CLIENT NOT TO ANSWER A QUESTION AND I'M WRONG THEN MY CLIENT'S GONNA PROBABLY GET FIRED I'M PROBABLY GONNA GET SUED FOR MALPRACTICE. SO THE AMOUNT OF POWER AND CONTROL THAT THE AGENCY AND THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE IS VERY VERY DISPROPORTIONATELY SKEWED AGAINST THE OFFICER COMPARED TO PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER KIND- THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING OR QUESTIONING. THAT ANY OTHER CITIZEN WOULD BE SUBJECT TO. IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT. I THINK IT IS UNNECESSARY TO HAVE A THIRD AYE AYE AS A PRACTICAL MATTER I THINK IT WOULD BOG DOWN THE PROCESS TO HAVE THE QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL SCREEN BY SOME THIRD PARTY. AND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER- THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIRD PARTY REVIEW- AND IT'S THROUGH THE DISCIPLINE IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AND ALL THE WAY YOU KNOW TO THE COURT SYSTEM WITH THE WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MAN DAMOS PROCESS- IF THE INVESTIGATOR- GOES OVERBOARD- ORDERS OUT OF BALANCE- MISTER MISTER. CHALLENGE THAT YOU CAN CHALLENGE AND FROM THE HEARING OFFICER FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION IN FRONT OF THE PERSONNEL BOARD AND IF THEY GO ALONG WITH THE INVESTIGATOR AND HE STILL DISAGREES HE CAN TAKE THAT UP TO THE COURTS AND THEY WILL ADDRESS IT THERE AND SO BUT IT IS ALL DONE AFTER THE FACT ADMITTEDLY. I THINK TRYING TO. IMPOSE A THIRD PARTY. IN ALL AT THE INTERROGATION STAGE- IS ONLY GOING TO SLOW THINGS DOWN- IN THE PROCESS IN. THE LAST POINT ON THIS- WELL THERE ARE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF INVESTIGATORS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDOUBTEDLY- MOST- SEEK OUT SPECIAL TRAINING TO BE AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATOR- POST PROVIDES TRAININGS I KNOW HAT THERE'S A LOT OF TRAINING- PROVIDED TO THESE INDIVIDUALS THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY NOT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS ARE TRAINED NOT TO DO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE BEST PRACTICES- WAYS TO CONDUCT AN EFFECTIVE FAIR AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WITHOUT. ARE VIOLATING OFFICERS RIGHTS BUT ALSO GETTING TO THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AND- INJECTING A JUST ANOTHER LAYER I THINK WOULD DO PROBABLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. YOU MEASURE CHINA FOR TWO SECONDS SURE GREATHEAD CHIEF RAMBLE SO JUST TO YOUR POINT I THINK WHAT THE POINT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE IS THE INTEGRITY OF THE INVESTIGATION THE INTEGRITY OF- THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION ON ITS- ON THE ONSET- I THINK THAT- AS A CHIEF- IF I HAD IT YEAH A CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING- ARMED. HERE INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT THAT I'M IN OR PERHAPS IF I'M IN- IN THIS YEAR'S DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH FOLKS THAT ARE- SKILL RETURNS. DATA PARTICULARLY ON SUCH A SERIOUS CASES PARTICULARLY LIKE USES OF FORCE FOR PERSON HAS ACTUALLY SUCCUMBED AND PASSED AWAY- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSPARENCY PART TO CONSIDER. MAYBE HAVING SOMEONE OF A THIRD PARTY SAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE QUESTIONS WE'RE LOOKING AT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO QUESTION THE OFFICER THE DEPUTY INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT THEREFORE IT GIVES THEM THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WATCHING THE INVESTIGATION AND IDEA THAT IT'S NOT JUST ALL DONE INTERNALLY AND AFTERWARDS THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO REALLY- SKIRT THE ISSUE OR MINIMIZE. WHAT WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKED AT BY LIKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING PART OF THE ORGANIZATION SO I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW MAYBE. IS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION AT SOME POINT. LIMIT SURE SO- LIMITED CLARIFY SO IT SHOULD I SHOULD THE BE MORE OF A CONCERN. PROTOCOL AS TO WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ASKED. THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EVALUATED. ANYONE WITH IT EIGHT I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT- I MEAN THIS REALLY WOULD BE FROM THE MANAGEMENT SIDE AND NOT MY BAILIWICK BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A STANDARD SET OF QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE COMPLAINTS ARE SO VARIED IN NATURE IN THERE SO FACT SPECIFIC THAT THEY YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW LIKE MOST AGENCIES WILL ASK AT THE END OF THE- INVESTIGATION ALL OF THE OFFICERS LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE VIOLATED. ASKING IF THEY VIOLATED IT- YOU KNOW AND IF NOT WHY A LOT OF TIMES IN WAYS THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE IT OR OR OR LIKE THAT THE FORMATTING OF THE QUESTIONS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE YOU YOU CAN'T I DON'T THINK MAKE JUST DIED A CHECKLIST OF. ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OTHER THAN JUST THE SORT OF INTRODUCTORY ONCE AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT ALL TURNS ON WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THE OFFICER. WHAT'S THE FACTUAL BACKDROP. IT AND I WOULD TO THAT WHAT'S THE RISK. OF THE- OR THE WEIGHT WHO IS ASKED QUESTIONS THAT THE CAN TO GO OR NOT. ALSO DISTRACT THE CHIEF MEMBERS COMMON- ABOUT THE PARTY- I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I THINK WHAT HE- AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG CHIEF BUT- WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE SEEKING THE ADVICE IF YOU WELL ABOVE CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING ADVISOR THAT'S- JOURNAL WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AS A AND AS I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTIONS. BRING THIRD PARTY STATE. EVALUATE THE QUESTIONS BEING PUBLISHED. I THINK MOST AGENCIES PARTICULARLY WITH HIGHER LEVEL MORE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS THEY DO BRING IN LAWYERS WHETHER YOU CALLING CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING ADVISORS. EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEYS- PROBAR ATTORNEYS WHAT. THERE IS THAT ADVICE AND COUNSEL BE EXCITED ABOUT. THE NATURE OF THE QUESTIONING THE SCOPE OF THE QUESTIONING AND THAT KIND OF THING- SO I THINK THAT IT'S HAPPENED. SENDING IT OUT THIRD PARTY THOUGH THAT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE AGENCY AT AGAIN I DO STILL BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE- BOB DOWN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST. MISTER SAID. EXACT TRUE IN MIKE'S. YOU'LL HAVE CITY ATTORNEYS WORKING OVER THE QUESTIONINGS BEFORE THEY MAKE A DECISION ON DISCIPLINE AND IT'S OFTEN THE CITY ATTORNEY WILL SAY GO BACK AND RE INTERVIEWED THE OFFICER TO GET MORE INFORMATION OR YOU HAVE. CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT A LOT LARGER AGENCIES WHERE THEY'RE REVIEWING EVERY INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION AND GIVING THE SAME KIND OF EMPLOYED BOTH ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON THE OVERALL QUALITY OF INVESTIGATION BASIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PUBLIC YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AGAIN CHIME IN- DURING THE PUBLICCOMMENTS AND WE'LL BE ASKING YOU TO CALL IN- LET ME REPEAT THE NUMBER. IT'S. TWO SO AGAIN. WILL BE GOING TO YOU IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES OR SO BUT I WANT TO FOLLOW AND CONTINUE ALL ALONG THE LINES OF THE INVESTIGATION. ARE THERE INVESTIGATION THAT DOES NOT MEET RICK OF REQUIRED TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION. IF SO HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT HURT POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD YOU PLEASE ANSWER- WITH A STATE OF- WIDE PERSPECTIVE NOT JUST LIKE A SINGLE DEPARTMENT PERSPECTIVE IF THAT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION MAYBE SO COULD YOU GET IT LET ME REPEAT AGAIN OUR THEIR INVESTIGATIONS THAT DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIRED TIME FRAME TO COMPLETE THEM AN INVESTIGATION THAT'S NUMBER ONE. AND THEN IF- IF SO HOW DOES THAT HURT POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. MISTER CHAIRMAN SO POLL ARE ACTUALLY DICTATES- THE TIME LIMIT SO- THAT IF AN OFFICER HAS OR DEPUTIES UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR MISCONDUCT- THE ONE YEAR STATUTE STANDS FROM DAY OF DEPARTMENT KNOWLEDGE- AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THAT AND THEN THE TIME IS TOLD- SO UNLESS DAVE OR THE OTHER CHINESE HAVE. MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY INVESTIGATION OUTSIDE OF THAT FROM POLICE MISCONDUCT- THAT HAS NO LIMITATION ON ON INVESTIGATION. THANK YOU BAG. AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT AS I SAID BEFORE I DON'T THINK IT POSES A PROBLEM I THINK WHERE LIKE MISTER SHELDON'S TALKING ABOUT WERE YOU MAYBE HAVE A CONFUSION OVER NUMBER YOU KNOW A COUPLE DAYS HERE THERE. THAT'S% REALLY JUST HUMAN NATURE TO PROCRASTINATE WHICH I YOU KNOW I THINK I MADE CLEAR I THINK IT'S AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO PROCRASTINATE- ON GETTING A DETERMINATION I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW. BELIEVE ME THAT THE AGENCIES MY CLIENTS THE CHIEFS AND EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN ARE BUSY- LOT IRONS IN THE FIRE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE DOMESTICATION IS COMPLETED. AND PROBABLY IF YOU SHORTEN IT TO SIX MONTHS. IT JUST IT DID EXACT SAME THING BUT AT AT THAT SIX MONTH. PERIOD HERE IN FUTURE IF YOU DO HAVE- SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLICATED REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME THERE'S AMPLE GROUNDS FOR TOLLING I MEAN IT'S AS SIMPLE AS MORE THAN ONE OFFICER INVOLVED IS GROUNDS FOR COLIN. ANY KIND OF THE CRIMINALS- INVESTIGATION ASPECT WHICH IS GONNA BE YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF DATA SAID IDEALLY FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. CIVIL SUIT AGAINST YASSER TOLD DAVE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY EXTRACTIONS. THAT WE KIND OF JOKED THAT IT YOU KNOW IT'S BARELY THERE BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR THE- LAST MEETING AGENCIES IT PUTS A MARKET STANDARD. WILL HAVE IT DONE BY THIS TIME. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT QUESTION IS WHEN AN OFFICER HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED DOES THAT INFORMATION STAYS ON THE OFFICER'S RECORD IF SO WHAT IS THE EXTENT. ON ALL I'LL TAKE A STAB AT THAT ONE- THE ANSWER IS YES DOES- IF AN OFFICER IF THE FINDINGS ARE SUSTAINED THE OFFICER- WILL BECOME A CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE MISCONDUCT- CAN RANGE AGAIN FROM- FROM COUNSELING WHICH IS NON DISCIPLINARY IN NATURE THAT THAT PROBABLY- IS TEMPORARY ANYTHING IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S RECORD- BUT ANYTHING THAT IS CONSIDERED FORMAL DISCIPLINE WHICH WE WHICH MADE. WHICH WOULD BE A WRITTEN REPRIMAND. ASSIST AND DEMOTION OUR NATION OF EMPLOYMENT THOSE ARE THE GENERALLY SPEAKING THE MORE SIGNIFICANT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THOSE ARE GONNA STAY ON THE OFFICER'S RECORD- THERE ARE AT PRESENT. AGENCIES THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THAT A PERMANENT. URGING OF OFFICERS FILES AFTER FIVE YEARS- AND SO SOME OF THOSE LATE OLDER DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS COULD THEORETICALLY BE REMOVED FROM THE OFFICERS FILE- THAT WILL BE CHANGING AT LEAST WITH SB SIXTEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY SUSTAINED- FINDING NOW NEEDS TO BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN YEARS- GOING FORWARD SO- TO HAS YOUR QUESTION THEY'RE GONNA BE KEPT AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND THE LEGISLATURE LEARNING MADE A CALL A JUDGMENT CALL- FORCES AGAINST THE STATE FINDINGS. NON SYSTEM FINDINGS I BELIEVE THOSE RECORDS ARE MANDATED TO BE KEPT FIVE YEARS SO- I THINK WHAT THIS EFFECTIVELY MEANS THOSE THOSE MO YOU PROVISIONS THAT DID A LOT FOR THE PURGING OF FILES WILL NO LONGER BE PERMISSIBLE- GIVEN THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING WITH US PIECE SIXTEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR PAUL PALMER MARENGO. ARE USED TO WITH THIS. I AM GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN- WE'RE ALMOST AT THE AT THE TIME WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I. MUST ASK YOU A QUESTION WHAT DO YOU SEE AS IT RELATES TO POMOR WOULD YOU SAID YES- THE CHANGING MAKE HIS AMENDMENTS- WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS IN THAT IN THAT SPACE. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY. AT SURE I THINK YOU KNOW THINKS THAT AT THE BEGINNING YEAH BY AND LARGE IT'S A FAIRLY SENSIBLE SIDE OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR OFFICERS AT BUT I DO THINK THERE'S PROBABLY ROOM FOR TWEAKING SO ONE THING THAT A NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING ILLINOIS ANTON IS MADE MUCH CLEAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AND SUPERVISOR. USE THAT YOU KNOW THOSE EARLY KIND OF FACT FINDING ASK QUESTIONS A SUPERVISORS ASK DON'T GET WRAPPED UP INTO A BAR PROCESS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN DISCUSSING RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW REASONABLE QUESTIONS AROUND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS I QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OLD DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE APPEALABLE WATER NUMBER OF STATES LIMIT YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE OUT. THIRTY DAYS OR MORE SUSPENSIONS OF TALENT ON THE WAR ARE AT YOUR BILL AND ALL OTHER THINGS ARE DEALT WITH IN A SOMEWHAT MORE FORMAL FASHION SO I THINK THERE'S ROOM CHECK TWEAK AND I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN I WOULD ALSO URGE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DO TWEAK ACT I WOULD BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE TWEAKING NOT JUST. BAR ITSELF BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE SAME PROVISIONS DON'T JUST REAPPEARING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN STATES WITHOUT WORDS A LOT OF THE SAME RESTRICTIONS SOMETIMES MUCH STRICTER ONES- THEY GET NEGOTIATED AWAY AND END UP BEING JUST AS MUCH OF AN IMPEDIMENT TO ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER SHELDON RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE. ON I GREEK- WITH PROFESSOR ON. I DON'T THINK THE BABY TO BE THROWN OUT. THERE CAN BE SOME TWEAKING AROUND THE GRAY AREA ABOUT THAT- THAT PRE INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION STAGE I THINK CLARITY THERE IS WE NEEDED- IT'S FINE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE ONE YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS THAT THAT THAT THAT. MISTER STALKING MAKES GREAT POINTS TO HIM YOU DON'T WANT THIS HANGING OVER OFFICERS HAD YOU WANT TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MOTIVATION TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION BUT- EVERYBODY SHOULD BE CLEAR WHEN THAT CLOCK STARTS RUNNING AND I THINK- GIVING US SOME CLARITY ON THAT. WOULD BE- WELCOME ALSO HAVE I THINK BETWEEN THE REMEDY PROVISION OF PULP ARE A SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AT SOME LEVEL ABOUT. KNOW WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY WHEN THEY'RE USING A VIOLATION OF THE POOL BAR- IN ALL CASES SHOULD EVIDENCE BE SUPPRESSED OR DISCIPLINE OVERTURNED BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A MINOR TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF THE ACT- I THINK THIS I THINK INTENT MATTERS. OR SHOULD MATTER. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK- TO THE EXTENT THE COMMITTEE'S GONNA LOOK AT THINGS ABOUT TWEAKING- THE ACT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE I THINK- WOULD BE WELCOME TO MY OPINION. THANK YOU. LAST THEN LASTLY I DO AGREE WITH THE PROFESSOR THAT- IF YOU ARE TO MAKE CHANGES YOU DO ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES AS WELL SO. THERE CAN'T BE AN INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES WHO JUST CONTRACT AROUND WHAT THE LIFE IS GO TO. ACHIEVE RAMBLE FOR ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MAY HAVE THAT I'LL DO THE SAME FOR MR MR ACNE AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. OF THE AGENDA- JUST VERY BRIEFLY CONCERNING THE- THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT. CONSIDER SHORTENING HAD- ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE IS A MOTIVATION TO DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS OF WITHIN A TIMELY MANNER NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ONE YEAR STATUTE. ARE YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION- MY REALIZATION IS A LITTLE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED FOLKS SOME AGENCIES ARE LARGEST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND- SO YOU HAVE NATURALLY MORE MORE EMPLOYEES YOU HAVE YOU KNOW MORE CASES GOING AND MOST INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUREAUS ARE NOT VERY LARGE IN SEOUL- THE NUMBER OF CASES- THAT. INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO HANDLE- JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LIKE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS- YOU CAN BE OVERWHELMING AND SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MANAGEABLE- AND THEN I CONCUR WITH YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS OF THE OTHER OUT OF THE OTHER FOLKS ARE JUST TRYING TO IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF. OF MISUNDERSTANDING. ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YEAH AS I SAID IN MY PRESENTATION MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO CODIFY THESE UNION RIGHTS FOR ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IMPORTANT- EITHER IN THE VARIOUS LABOR STATUTES LIKE MYERS MILLER'S BROWN BILLS ACTING CETERA- OR JUST IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE I DID WANT TO TOUCH JUST ON TWO POINTS THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS WITH THE RESPECTED DUE PROCESS THIS STATUTE DOESN'T SPECIFY WHAT GETS APPEALED OR ONE THOUSAND GET A FIELD THAT'S A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. AND GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO SKELLY AND WHAT OUR SUPREME COURT SAID IS THAT THE NATURE OF THE DEPRIVATION DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF DUE PROCESS THAT'S REQUIRED SO FOR INSTANCE- YES YOU CAN APPEAL A LETTER OF REPRIMAND BUT ONLY IF IT SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THE FUTURE AND THE APPEAL AS A MEETING WITH THE SUPERVISOR THAT ISSUE THAT YOU'RE SOMEBODY THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO OVERTURN IT IT'S NOT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IT'S NOT AS EXPENSIVE OR CUMBERSOME PROCESS- AS COMPARED TO A TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE- WITH RESPECT TO THE REMEDY. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. WITH MR SHELDON ON SOME POINTS THAT THE COURT CAN FASHION A REMEDY BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC. OTHER BILL OF RIGHTS AND OTHER STATES IT IS AUTOMATIC THAT IF YOU COMMIT A VIOLATION- THEN. X. HAPPENS TO CASES THROWN OUT OR EVIDENCE IS SUPPRESSED. I HAVE NOT SEEN A CASE THROWN OUT BECAUSE- OF A PROCEDURAL VIOLATION TYPICALLY WHAT DAY THE COURTS WILL DO. IS I THINK LOBBY- WAS- ONE OF THE SEMINAL CASES ON THIS THEY APPLIED FOR A MIDDLE TYPE STANDARD LIKE IF YOU. INTERROGATED SOMEBODY WITHOUT ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE A WRAP YOU CAN'T USE THAT INTERROGATION AGAINST THEM BUT YOU CAN READ NOTICE ON AND GIVE THEM A PROPER INTERROGATION- WITH THE RAP AND YOU CAN STILL DISCIPLINE I'M AND I'VE HAD CASES WHERE THAT'S HAPPENED IN THAT. STATE MINISTER ON HOW BUT THE NETWORK SAYS THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENS THE COURT HAS BROAD DISCRETION BUT THEY WILL TYPICALLY SAY THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENS YOU CAN PROCEED WITH THE CASE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE EXCEPT FOR. THE ILL GOTTEN STATEMENT- WHICH TYPICALLY IT'S NOT MUCH OF A REMEDY TO MY CLIENTS IT'S REALLY MORE JUST- HOLDING THE AGENCIES FEET TO THE FIRE. BECAUSE THEY CAN GO RE INTERVIEWED THEM. AND TO GET THOSE STATEMENTS AND THERE HAVE BEEN COURT CASES WHERE THE COURTS HAVE COME DOWN AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A VIOLATION. OF OUR POP ARCS AND TOLD THE AGENCY YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY DON'T DO THIS AGAIN AND GIVE THEM A WARNING BUT THEN SAID THAT BASED ON THE THINGS MISTER SHELDON WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE INTENT AND WAS THAT A MISTAKE IN AND ALL OF THOSE FACTORS. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE- I RECOURSE OR REMEDY BEYOND JUST TELLING TE AGENCY. NOT TO DO IT AGAIN- SO JUST IN CONCLUSION I THINK THAT THESE ARE SIMPLE. CARE BASIC FAIRNESS AND BASIC DUE PROCESS RIGHTS THAT SHOULD BE CODIFIED FOR ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD THE WAY. ON THE SLAVERY SHE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE PRE EACH OF YOU WE ASK YOU TO STAND BY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT- WE WOULD ASK THAT ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO ADDRESS THIS BODY- WE WOULD ASK YOU PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE PLEASE DON'T TOUCH IT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST THE MICROPHONE- FOR YOU- AND THEN YOU PLEASE PROCEED IN ADS IN ASKING YOUR QUESTION- WE ASK THAT YOU- CERTAINLY BE RESPECTFUL OF THE PRESENTERS AND ALSO THOSE ON THE DYESS WITH RESPECT YOUR COMMENTS SO. WITH THAT IF YOU PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. AND APPROACH THEM YES THE MICROPHONE. MORNING I'M WE NEED YOU TO COME A LITTLE CLOSER. YEAH.

THANK YOU FOR READING FROM A CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE FROM JUNE TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE IS NO LAW AND WITHOUT LAW THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION TOM MCCLINTOCK WE RECENTLY SUFFERED MULTIPLE FAILURES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEGINNING WITH THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. HE DIED BECAUSE A ROGUE ROGUE COPS WHO DESPITE MULTIPLE MISCONDUCT COMPLAINT REMAIN ON THE POLICE FORCE ADDED ONE OF HIS ACCOMPLICES THIS HAS BECOME INTOLERABLE PATTERN IN OUR BIG CITY POLICE SOURCES AND WE NEED TO ASK HOW POLITICALLY POWERFUL POLICE UNIONS AND THE POLITICIANS THEY MAINTAIN AN OFFICE PROTECTABLE IS IN THE SYSTEM. THAT INEVITABLY LEADS TO ATROCITIES LIKE THIS THE OTHER FAILURE WAS THE DECISION TO WITHHOLD POLICE PROTECTION FROM THEIR CITIZENS BY MAYORS AND THEIR APPOINTED POLICE CHIEF. DOT FAILURE KILLED PATH UNDER WOULD DAVID DORN AND SO MANY OTHER INNOCENT VICTIMS IN THE ENSUING RIOT. WITH THE WESTERN POLICE PROTECTION FOR OUR STREETS ABANDONING POLICE STATIONS TO RIOTERS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO LOOTING ARSON AND MAYHEM ALL HAVE AN INCENDIARY EFFECT ON INSURRECTION'S WITHOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE IS NO WALK IN WITHOUT LAW THERE IS NO CIVILIZATION AND ACCOUNTING OF THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY THE LACK. OF DERELICTION OF DUTY IS YET TO BE TALLIED BUT IT WILL BE STAGGERING WE NEED TODAY TO CHART A COURSE FRWARD WE CAN LOOK TO NO BETTER GUIDE THAN SIR ROBERT PEEL THE FATHER OF MODERN POLICING WHO SUPPORTS PRINCIPLES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR A FREE SOCIETY NEARLY TWO CENTURIES AGO WHEN YOU READ THEM YOU REALIZE. HOW FAR WE'VE DRIFTED FROM THESE MORNINGS CENTRAL TO OUR DISCUSSION THIS IS SEVENTH PRINCIPLE TO MAINTAIN AT ALL TIMES THE RELATIONSHIP THE PUBLIC THAT GIVES REALITY TO THE HISTORIC TRADITION THAT THE POLICE ARE THE PUBLIC AND THAT THE PUBLIC ARE THE POLICE THE POLICE BEING ONLY MEMBERS. OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE PAID TO GIVE FULL TIME ATTENTION TO DUTIES WHICH ARE INCUMBENT ON EVERY CITIZEN IN THE INTEREST OF COMMUNITY WELFARE. AND EXISTENCE HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THE PRINCIPLE. THERE ARE MANY WERE. PROPOSED THAT MERIT SUPPORT FIRST THE DOCTOR QUALIFY IN. CURRENTLY APPLIED NO. IN THE NATION WILL BY LAW FOR EVER RIGHT MUST BE A REMEDY QUALIFIED IMMUNITY PREVENTS A REMEDY FOR THOSE WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY OFFICIALS HOLDING A PUBLIC TRUST THIS REFORM. SHOULD APPLY AS MUCH TO THE ROBOCOP WHO TARGETS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE AS IT DOES TO IRAQ. OR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO TARGET PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICS REFORMING QUALIFIED IMMUNITY SIMPLY HOLD PUBLIC OFFICIALS. TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS ANY OTHER CITIZEN EXERCISING THE SAME POWERS SECOND POLICE RECORDS MUST BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IT IS A WELL ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS WORK FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE AUTHORITY THE PUBLIC HAVE LOANED TO THEM AND POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISMISS THAT OFFICERS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. FROM THEIR UNIONS. HOWEVER SOME ACCESS THROUGH THESE RECORDS AND TWO DEPART FROM ON THEM WE DESTROYED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF SUCCESSFUL POLICING IN A FREE SOCIETY PUBLIC TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE MONEY POLICE DEPARTMENT INTO PEP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS- NEXT CALLER OPERATOR PLEASE. WE'LL MOVE ON TO LINE ELEVEN GO AHEAD PLEASE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. A GOOD MORNING SORRY ABOUT THAT- GOOD ACTORS ARE GOOD MORNING CHAIR INSURE MEMBERS- AND MATURING ON MARCH IN CALLING FROM PLASTER COUNTY. AND SUPPORT OF OUR PLEASE OFFICERS I AM VERY I AM VERY CONCERNED ON HOW THIS COMMITTEE TALKED A BIRD AND THE MEDIA HAVE PORTRAYED LAW ENFORCEMENT THE PUBLIC. ACCORDING TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PARTS OF APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE US IS ONLY ONE PERSON IS ESTIMATED TO BE CORRUPTS. HELLO IS THAT. MY GRANDFATHER. WAS AN H. P. OFFICER AND HIGHLY RESPECTED FOR NEVER HAVING TO PULL A GUN AND HIS TWENTY FOUR YEAR CAREER YES. REPUBLICAN WHAT KIND OF TRAINING DID HE HAVE. OR MAYBE ACTOR CRIMES ARE VIOLENT- AGAINST OUR HAS INCREASED. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT NO ONE IS ADDRESSING EDUCATION FOR OFFICERS. I THINK THAT WHAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON IS HOW MUCH TRAINING DID THAT GET INTO THE SIX MONTH PROGRAM MAYBE STANDING THE TRAINING PROGRAM EIGHTEEN MONTHS. WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY- A TECHNOLOGICAL EVALUATION TO OFFICERS RECEIVED BEFORE OR AFTER THIS THAT THE CATION. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT- PLEASE- TO BE A POLICE OFFICER IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT JOB IN THE WORLD. AND MAYBE CRIMINALS ARE PEOPLE BREAKING THE LAW SHOULD BE MORE PENALIZED AND PUNISHING OFFICERS FOR DOING MERIT. BECAUSE WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IT IS TO KEEP ARRESTING REPEAT OFFENDERS THAT JUDGES LIKE OUT. ON THE STREETS PRIME RATE 210% GO AND L. A. HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN THIS IS THE STUPIDEST BELL ON THE PLANET. TALK TALK ABOUT MISCONDUCT YOU READY TO REMEMBER. YOU'RE RISKING THE LIVES OF CITIZENS AND OFFICERS AND DEFEND US STOP DEFINING OUR POLICE AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY FALL THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF EPRIMAND FOR FALSE REPORTING. THANK YOU.

EIGHT OF THOSE TWENTY BILLS WOUND UP ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THOSE EIGHT BILLS INTO LAW AS WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA AND AS WE LOOK AT.
