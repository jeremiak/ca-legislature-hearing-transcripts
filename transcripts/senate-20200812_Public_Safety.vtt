WAS ORIGINALLY STRUCTURED WELL

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.009
I DON'T KNOW FOR REGIONALLY BUT

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.477
THE BILL THAT WAS BEFORE US

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:31.450
HAD- HAD INVESTIGATION.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.186
REQUIRED IF A TEACHER IF A. D.

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:40.092
A. POLICE AGENCY REQUESTED IT.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.193
AND THAT WHILE I APPRECIATE

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.564
THAT THAT IS THAT THERE ARE

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.132
THOSE TWO CATEGORIES ARE

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.168
LEGITIMATE REQUESTERS FOR SUCH

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.003
INVESTIGATION THEY'RE CERTAINLY

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.605
NOT THE ONLY AND THAT IF WE

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:56.809
WERE TO PROCEED WITH A BILL

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.477
THAT MANDATED. ONLY

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.312
INVESTIGATIONS WITH BY THE

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:04.883
REQUEST OF DA'S OR- A LAW

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.388
ENFORCEMENT THAT THEIR- PEOPLE

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.856
WITH THEIR COULD BE SHOOTINGS

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.257
THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:13.792
THAT WOULD NOT BE AND

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.194
ADDITIONALLY WE MAY BE IN A

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.261
SITUATION WHERE THE STATE IS

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:18.230
USING RESOURCES FOR AN

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:21.733
INVESTIGATION THAT THE LOCALITY

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.734
POTENTIALLY COULD OF

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.604
INVESTIGATED BUT IS- THEN THE

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:29.675
IN FACT THERE. ARE THEY ARE

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.977
SHOOTING THE COST THE STATE SO

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.413
IT THE R. INTENT OF THE

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.615
AMENDMENTS WAS NUMBER ONE TO

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.351
ENSURE. THAT AL DEATHS OF

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:42.488
UNINFORMED THE CIVILIANS BE

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:45.858
INVESTIGATED SO THAT IS TO PUT

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:47.226
THAT IS RIGHT NOW IN THERE THAT

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.727
ALL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.531
ANYONE STASHED THAT THEY WOULD-BE INVESTIGATED THEN

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:56.869
SECONDARILY. THE INCLUSION OF

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.337
THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:01.240
JURISDICTION SO A COUNTY BOARD

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:04.009
OF SOUPS OR CITY COUNCIL. COULD

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:04.943
VOTE TO ASK FOR AN

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.580
INVESTIGATION NOT JUST THE DA'S

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.049
OR POLICE AGENCIES. SO THAT IS

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:15.454
HOW THE BILL'S STRUCTURED NOW

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.156
THAT RATHER THAN IT'S USING THE

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.491
TERMINOLOGY THE ATTORNEY

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.827
GENERAL SERVICES STATE

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:22.828
PROSECUTOR NOTE THE MOM. THERE

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.062
STATE PROSECUTOR IS THE

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:27.499
ATTORNEY GENERAL SO UNLESS

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:31.303
THERE'S SOME A FUTURE ACTION IT

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.305
WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:36.842
THE HOWEVER. WHAT THE BILL

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.479
ALLOWS FOR IS. BECAUSE IF THIS

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:43.782
POLICY MOVES. WE WON'T BE

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.918
THERE'S A COST TO THIS POLICY

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:49.021
SO ASSUMING THAT IT MOVES.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:49.721
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:51.423
APPROPRIATION IN THE FUTURE

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.960
BUDGET. AND AT THAT POINT. THE

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.463
ISSUES OF. WHO THAT STATE

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.899
PROSECUTOR IS AND HOW IT IS

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:03.769
CONSTITUTED. AND WHAT ITS

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:05.304
STAFFING IS AND ALL THOSE

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.606
THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT. IN

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.008
THAT APPROPRIATIONS SO THAT IS

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.878
THE BILL AS AMENDED THAT WE

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:15.647
HAVE BEFORE US SO IT BROADENS.

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.849
WHAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE BY

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:19.351
MAKING SURE THAT INVESTIGATIONS

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:20.919
OF ALL UNARMED DEATHS OF

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.590
UNARMED. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:25.090
INVESTIGATION THAT ARE

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.527
REQUESTED BY MORE THAN JUST DE

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.896
ACER POLICE AGENCIES. AND

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.764
SPECIFIES IT IS A STATE

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.233
PROSECUTOR SO THAT. AND

ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS THAT WAS

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.008
INACCURATE NOW THAT THERE IS

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.109

POTENTIALLY HAVING A

REIMBURSEMENT FROM A LOCAL

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.451
ENTITY THAT WE NEEDED I THINK

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:49.374
OKAY THEN IT CREATES THAT

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.241
POSSIBILITY BUT IT DOES NOT

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:52.110
INSURE ALL RIGHT SO WHAT I'M

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.678
SAYING INDEPENDENT I'M ASSUMING

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.380
THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS AN

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:57.181
INDEPENDENT AGENCY WHAT ARE

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:59.217
WHAT I HEAR BEING SAID IS THAT

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.519
ISN'T NECESSARILY THE CASE OR

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.187
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. ASSUME

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:04.789
THAT THE AG'S INDEPENDENT IS

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.791
THAT CORRECT IN OTHER WORDS

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.126
WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:12.297

AT THE CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:19.103
AS AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.139
BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.541
SUPPOSED TO STEP IN- TWO

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.843
SITUATIONS WHERE. THERE IS A

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.746

OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMES

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.886
IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. COUNTY

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.888
WIDE AND IN THE CONTROL OF THE

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.222
DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THAT

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.858
COUNTY SO. BOB THERE'S A

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.461
QUESTION HERE APPARENTLY ABOUT

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.896
WHETHER THE AG IS DEEMED

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.464
INDEPENDENT OR WHETHER WHAT

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:47.665
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS AN

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:50.068
ENTIRELY SEPARATE ENTITY. THAT

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:53.571
PROBABLY DOESN'T YET EXIST SIDE

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.573
CORRECT. NOT TO CONFUSE THINGS

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.008
BUT IF YOU'RE FROM THE OP.

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.343
THERE'S KIND OF GROUPS THERE

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:01.079
THERE'S THE LAWN FOR. THE V.

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.780
OPPOSITE. AND THERE ARE SOME OF

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:04.916
THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS IS

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.484

SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS A PENNANT

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.987
INDEPENDENT OFF IN THE FIRST

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:11.889
PLACE. I THINK IT'S INDEPENDENT

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.291
BECAUSE IT'S SEPARATE FROM THE

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:17.628
LOCAL DETACHMENT SO THE POSTAL

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.530

WHETHER WE'VE SEEN IN A BIG

THAT. THESE NUMBERS HAVE GONE

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.490

PROCESS FOR THAT. RIGHT SO ALL

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.980
RIGHT SO I MIGHT I GUESS MY

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:12.349

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.684
THE NUMBER OF THESE INCIDENTS

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:15.853
GO DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN SO

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.888

BASIS- IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION.

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:25.963
THAT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE THE

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.765
RIGHT TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT WE

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:30.401
WILL BE SEEING THE REQUEST MADE

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.636
IN THIS SORT OF DISCRETIONARY

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.672
BASIS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN-

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:41.112
ACTUALLY EIGHT KM- IN ARMS.

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.114
INTERACTION ARE YOU

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.850
ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL SEE

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.919
THOSE AGENCIES- MAKE THE

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.121
REQUEST FOR AN INDEPENDENT

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:53.157
REVIEW BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.191
PART OF THE CONCERN THE

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.694
OPPOSITION THAT STILL EXISTS.

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:59.029
IS THAT THEY WANT TO UNDER ANY

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:02.566
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS TO BE DONE-

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:05.002
BY A STATE PROSECUTOR. AND NOT

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.138
MAKE IT DISCRETIONARY I WOULD

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:07.972
ASSUME THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.074
AGENCIES THAT WOULD SAY NO WE

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.409
CAN'T AFFORD IT YEAH SO IS THAT

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:13.978
IS THAT IN ANY WAY FACTORED IN

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.179
NOT THAT I'M SAYING THAT THAT

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.847
SHOULD BE A DETERMINANT BUT I'M

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.149
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.650
THIS BILL IS LIKELY TO

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:23.120
ACCOMPLISH YEAH I THINK AS A

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:23.621
CHIRLA TWO. WE HAVE THE

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.156
APPROPRIATIONS BUT ALSO THIS IS

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:26.857
PURSUANT TO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:27.858
AND GETTING IMPLEMENTS THE

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.093
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS SOME

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.594
IDEAS ABOUT THIS THERE ARE SOME

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.229
SPOTS. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.131
DISINCENTIVE FOR LOCAL

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.333
JURISDICTIONS TO SAY HEY. THIS

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.868
CASE IS RIPPING OUR COMMUNITY

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:40.037
APART THERE'S SO MUCH DISTRESS

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.605
BE LIKE A STATE PROSECUTOR STEP

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.240
IN I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.842
HIGH PROFILE INCIDENT. IN

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:48.279
VALLEJO THE CITY OF VALLEJO

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.480
AFTER HAVING A BIZARRE ATTORNEY

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.148
GENERAL THAT REFUSED TO DO THE

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.616
INVESTIGATION SAID WE WANT TO

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.418
TAKE IT WILL PAY FOR IT. SO THE

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.854
CITY ACTUALLY SAID WE WILL PAY

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.490
FOR IT SO I KNOW THERE THERE IS

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:00.024
A PRECEDENT OF A LOCAL GUY

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:00.958
STEPPING UP AND SAYING. THEY

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:03.794
WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AND I

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.729
THINK IT'S TO BE AS FAR AS WHAT

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.331
THAT REIMBURSEMENT WOULD LOOK

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.000
LIKE IT WOULDN'T BE ALL OF IT

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.836
BUT MAYBE SOME TYPE OF A SHARED

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:13.871
AGREEMENT IS NOT UNREASONABLE.

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:15.206
THANK YOU AND I MIGHT INDICATE

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:17.007
MY STAFF HAS ADVISED ME THAT

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:18.309
THE NUMBERS I RECITED IT TO

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.844
COME FROM THE END OF LACI PEACH

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.046

OF THE AMENDMENT TO TAKE IT IN

00:41:58.215 --> 00:41:59.750
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:02.319
YOU ARE REPUBLICANS. BY PRE.

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.320
SENATOR JACK TRYING TO WALK ALL

STATE PROSECUTOR AND THIS

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:25.109
NOTION THAT THAT COULD BE

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:25.643
SOMETHING POTENTIAL IN THE

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:30.114
FUTURE. MY CONCERN WITH THIS

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.851
LANGUAGE IS THAT WE'RE NOT

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:36.453
SETTING POLICY IN PLACE TODAY

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.055
THAT CAN GO INTO EFFECT AS

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.890
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SET UP

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.492
A PROCESS BY WHICH WE ALL LIVE

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:44.962

CHAOTIC MY WORD. BUT I JUST

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.581
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.350
AREN'T SENDING. UP FOR FURTHER

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.786
DELAY FOR ACTION. THAT WHATEVER

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.988
WE PASSED THE POLICY WE COME UP

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.723
WITH- ON AS A GOAL FOR

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.158
PROCREATION THAT IS SOMETHING

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.327
THAT THAT HAS A PLAN THAT IS

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.162

SEE THIS LANGUAGE CHANGE TO A

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:25.769
STATE PROSECUTOR. I INTERPRET

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.504
THAT TO MEAN INDEPENDENT UNTIL

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:28.973
I HEARD MADAM CHAIR SAY WHAT

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:31.141
COULD BE THE AG ANSEL THAN THAT

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:34.578
SET ME BACK AND SO. I'M JUST

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.646
CONCERNED THIS FIELD LIKE A

00:43:58.335 --> 00:44:03.874
FINITE. THE FOLLOWING. CAN YOU

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:08.278
DO A FIVE YEAH I GUESS THE BIG

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:09.413
PICTURE IS WHETHER IT WAS THE

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.348
VERSION THREE DAYS AGO OR THIS

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:14.318
ONE THE IT STILL WOULD HAVE TO

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.686
BE SUBJECT TO NEXT YEAR'S.

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:18.489
BUDGET AS FAR AS FINDING IT SO

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:19.790
IF THIS LAW BECOMES WAS SIGNED

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.859
BY THE GOVERNOR IN OCTOBER. IT

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:23.193
WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE ON

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.796
JANUARY ONE. THE CITY COUNCIL

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.198
OR- THE AIR CHIEF COULD CALL UP

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.267
AND SAY HEY. LET'S GO. WELL IT

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:31.935
WOULD HAVE TO BE FUNDED IN THE

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:35.639
BILL PURSUANT TO THE NEXT

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.241
YEAR'S BUDGET ACT SO. WITHOUT

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:39.309
THAT WERE ON THAT EITHER WAY.

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.911
AND SO THE HOW WOULD WE BECAUSE

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:43.180
WHETHER IS IN THE- HOW DEFINED

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.250
A STATE. SHALL I MEAN I I'M ON

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:48.585
COME WITH THE- LACK OF CLEAR

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:49.853
ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.289
PROSECUTOR. IS THE AG OR

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.991
WHETHER OUR INTENT IS TO SET UP

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:55.292
SOMETHING INDEPENDENT IF WE

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.594

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.896
THEN THAT IT WILL SAY THAT THAT

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.597
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.332
ABOUT WHO THAT IS THEN

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:03.667
TRANSITIONS TO THE BUDGET

PROCESS. BUT THAT'S A WHOLE

00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:07.171
DIFFERENT KIND OF I THINK

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.672

CURRENT PRACTICE NOW IS THAT.

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:17.094
THE BILL'S WRITTEN IF THE AN

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.730

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.669
IT IS ALSO A CHANGES WHO

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:30.274
A SURE OF FIFTY EIGHT THAT OUR

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.842
CONSTITUTIONALOFFICERS THAT

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:34.478
ARE ELECTED TO THE RESPONSIBLE

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.947
TO THE VOTERS TO DO WHAT WHAT

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.915
WHAT'S BEST IN. THEY WOULD THEN

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:40.517
GIVE IT TO THE ELECTED DISTRICT

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:43.086
ATTORNEY ALSO A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:44.821
OFFICER. AND THERE'S ALSO THE

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.590
GRAND JURY OF EACH COUNTY

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:48.692

POLICE CHIEF SO I CAN SEE WHY

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.285
THEY WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY TO

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:04.187
PERSPECTIVE IN. AN AND HOPING

THAT WE DON'T SET OURSELVES UP

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:12.495
FOR. A PROLONGED. PROCESS AND

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:14.430
ALSO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:17.734
FULLY CONTROL IF WE'RE NOT

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.902
CLEAR ABOUT THE WHO AND THE

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:21.738
WHAT AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:25.775
CONTENT UPON A- BUDGET PRICE

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:28.411
PROCESS THAT THAT TAKES. US OUT

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.013
OF THE FINAL ANALYSIS TO SOME

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:32.615
DEGREE IN ALL FAIRNESS- SIZE

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:33.216
ONE TO MAKE SURE I SAID THAT

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:35.852
BUT I'M ON THE BILL AT THIS

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.620
POINT- AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:41.724
BE PLUGGED IN TO. THE CHANGES

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.459
AS THEY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP.

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:46.996
JUST ONE FOR. THE REJECTION

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:50.533
YEAH I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.167
TOO BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.069
THIS DISCUSSION ALONG BUT I'D

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.972
SAY THIS THIS BILL AND THE

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.273
WHOLE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THE-

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.708
WE'RE TWO WEEKS FROM THE END OF

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.944
SESSION AND WE'RE STILL TRYING

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.245
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:05.114
AMENDMENTS ARE INTO. A IT'S A

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.716
LITTLE UNSETTLING- THIS IS AN

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:09.586
IMPORTANT ISSUE- I WOULD HAVE

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:11.521
TO BEG TO DIFFER WITH SOME OF

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:12.589
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WHO

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:16.359
HAVE- SPOKEN UP HERE IF YOU

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.527
DON'T LIKE WHAT THE PROPOSED

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.796
SOLUTION BETTER OFFER SOMETHING

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:23.867
YOURSELVES- THE BECAUSE- I

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.602
THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:26.870
THERE IS AT LEAST THE

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.771
PERCEPTION IF NOT A REALITY

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.440
THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY OFFICER

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:31.741
INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND THAT

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.610
THEY'RE NOT PROPERLY

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:36.479
INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESSED AND

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.547
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:41.017
TRYING TO DO HERE. NOT QUITE

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:44.053
SURE I'M TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.889
AND I'M WILL REFLECT ON THIS A

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:46.656
LITTLE BIT MORE THESE

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:49.492
AMENDMENTS OBVIOUSLY MORE CLEAR

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:51.794
TO THE PEOPLE'S IN SUPPORT AND

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:55.965
OPPOSITION FROM HOPE TO WE GET

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.834
THAT CLARITY BEFORE THE BILL

00:58:57.901 --> 00:59:03.006
COMES BEFORE US UP THE FLOOR.

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.741
BUT IF IT DOES AND I'M A PRE

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:05.875
YOUR EFFORTS BOB AGAIN LIKE TO

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.176
INVITE. OTHER WHO OPPOSE THIS

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.411
NOTION OF INDEPENDENT

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:11.114
INVESTIGATIONS- HAVE TO

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.582
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE FRANKLY

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:16.252
DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT TO-

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.688
MONITOR AND TO REGULATE THEIR

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:19.822
OWN AND I THINK THAT THERE IS

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:23.293
SOME. LEGITIMATE REASON WHY-

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.428
BUT TO AND THAT'S WHY I'M GOING

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.529
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:27.964
DOES TRY TO MOVE THAT BALL

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.032
FORWARD INTO A MORE

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:32.902
INDEPENDENT- ENTITY THAT

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.804
DOESN'T HAVE ITS- OWN INTEREST

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:37.006
IN THE OUTCOME. BUT WE DID THIS

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:42.178
PREVIOUSLY- IN THE AREA OF- OUR

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.714
SHERIFFS WERE ALSO THE-

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.984
CORNERS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.519
SOME PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:51.154
THAT AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.389
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMING TO BE

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.291
PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. AND

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:59.462
THE REALITIES OF THE PUBLIC'S

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.864
PERSPECTIVE. M. HEALTH TO UP.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:06.102
IN TRYING TO LEAVE A- OF THOSE

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:07.270
ALLEGED CONCERNS. I WILL SEND

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.838
BUT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.506
THIS BECAUSE THE MOMENT SO

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:14.677
THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.484
INTRODUCED THE VERSIONS

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.853
BELASYSE A THIRD THIRD TIME. SO

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.855
EVEN THOUGH- YOU KNOW HE'S

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.090
IMPORTANCE AS TERMS OF CONTACTS

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:29.359
YES THIS IS AN ABBREVIATED

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:30.994
SESSION. READING CHALLENGES

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.595
WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.297

IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.982
NOT A NEW. IDEA OF THE AUTHOR

STRONG STATEMENT. ABOUT

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.466

INCLUDING THE OFFICERS BECAUSE

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.518
OF AN OFFICER- FOR DECISIONS

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.653
MAY NOT TO CHARGE TO EXONERATE

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.922
THE OFFICER. IT'S GONNA YOU

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.090
KNOW HAVING THE COMMUNITY HAVE

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.691
CONFIDENCE THAT IT WAS A REAL

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:38.061
INVESTIGATION INDEPENDENT-

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.362
INVESTIGATION THAT THAT'S

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.464
IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE FOR THE

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.365
COMMUNITY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.834
THE FAMILY AND THE SURVIVORS

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:50.306
INTEREST. FOR THERE TO BE

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.942
UNIVERSAL CONFIDENCE OF THIS

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.844
THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.679
DONE INDEPENDENTLY AND WELL. I

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:57.780
NOTICED SOME MORE WORK TO DO

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.749
AND FRANKLY PARKING TO BE MORE

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.751
WORK TO DO NEXT YEAR-BUT I DO

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:02.718
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:06.189
MAKE A STATEMENT I SUPPORT THIS

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:09.158
BILL. THIRTY THREE FOUR FIVE S.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.195
FOR YOUR CLOTHES LET ME JUST.

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:14.063
ADD WHAT I HOPE IS SOME

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.732
CLARIFICATIONS SOUGHT. D. THE

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:22.205
BILL. IF IT IS SIGNED INTO LAW

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:22.939
DOES IMMEDIATELY GOING TO

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.875
AFFECT THE END BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.176
A STATE PROSECUTOR AND THAT IS

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.779
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO IT DOES

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.914
IMMEDIATELY GOING TO AFFECT.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.383
THE DIFFERENCE THE THING THAT

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.886
THE BILL FUNDAMENTALLY DOES

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.221
THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.156
STATUS QUO THE STATUS QUO RIGHT

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:43.092
NOW. OUR STATE PROSECUTOR THE

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.528
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS THE RIGHT

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.497
TO INVESTIGATE ANY SHOOTING.

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:49.765
AND RIGHT NOW IT JURISDICTION

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.434
CAN ASK THEM TO AS WE HAVE

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.637
OBSERVED THEY HAPPEN. IN SOME

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.372
CASES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.375
SAID NO. AND I'M NOT REFERRING

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.010
LET ME BACK UP I'M NOT TRYING

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.011
TO PERSONALIZE THIS TO A

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.379
CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL IF WE

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.148
LOOK T ALL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.083
FOR THE LAST AT LEAST MYERS

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.718
RATIONS TWENTY YEARS. THEY

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:11.621
HAVE. THOSE OFFICES HAVE NOT

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.789
WANTED TO BE INVOLVED IN

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:16.492
INVESTIGATING SUCH SHOOTINGS.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.127
THEY HAVE TENDED NOT TO. WHERE

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:19.795
THEY HAVE. AND TEY'VE TENDED

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:22.765
NOT TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.000
WHEN THEY ARE ASKED. SO THE

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:25.601
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE AT THIS

IS. D. DESIRE TO ESTABLISH WELL

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:20.156

ONE SET UP AN INDEPENDENT

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:51.520
OFFICE THAT WOULD TAKE TIME AND

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.456
THEN THERE WOULD BE OTHER

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.625
PROVISIONS IN EFFECT WOULD NOT

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.693
GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.395
BECAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE THE

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.130
TIME TO ESTABLISH THAT

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.499
