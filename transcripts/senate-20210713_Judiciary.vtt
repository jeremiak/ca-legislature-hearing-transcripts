YES YEAH MISTER TURNER I'M

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:59.177
LOOKING FOR CLARIFICATION ON

00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:02.781
THE DEFINITION. OF THE COMPACT

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:05.717
COMMINGLING RATE THEORY RECENT

AFTER HE Q. TALK ABOUT THE FORM

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.326
OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL VERSUS

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.729
THE TYPE OF THE TYPE IS THE

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:20.098
RESIN IS THE IS THE SAME. AS

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:22.133
THE ONE BUT WE'RE SEPARATING

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.835
RATHER THAN WE'RE SEPARATING

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:25.336
BOTH OF THEM AND I DON'T

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:28.339
UNDERSTAND. THE IMPLICATIONS OF

00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:30.208
THAT IF THE RESIN IS THE SAME

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:33.278
AT AN END I GUESS THE REASON

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:35.146
FOR. RT ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING I

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.482
WAS ON THAT- MISTER- DAVID TO

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:42.821
CANCER THAT. DAVID ARE YOU

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:47.292
AVAILABLE. I AM I'M HERE YES-

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.960
THE REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING TO

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:50.395
HAVE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.996
CONTAINER SEPARATED OUT BECAUSE

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.898
WITH THE B. SEVEN NINETY THREE

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:55.033
BOTTLES ARE REALLY GOING TO END

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.103
UP BEING RECYCLED AND MR TO GO

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.405
BACK INTO BOTTLES. AND GIVE

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:02.474
THEM A FORMS ARE NOT SEGREGATED

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.410
OUT- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:06.311
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:07.846
SITUATION THAT WE'VE HAD UP TO

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.881
THIS POINT WHICH IS WHERE THEY

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.417
ARE NOT COLLECTED- AND MOST

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:14.085
AMANDA BEING SENT TO LANDFILL

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.320
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.788
PLATFORM CONTAINERS ARE

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.523
AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING TO GO

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.892
BACK INTO. NORMAL FORMS ARE

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.194
ALSO SOME- PROPERTIES THERMAL

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:25.163
FORMS- THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.965
THROUGH THE IVIES ARE LOWER

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.199
THAN BOTTLES AND THEY REALLY

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.834
ARE COMPATIBLE TO BE RECYCLED

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:31.269
WITH BOTTLES EITHER MOST OF THE

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:32.871
BOTTLE RECYCLERS WILL SPEAK

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:38.243
AROUND THE STATE. THEY HAVE NO.

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:38.776
THERMAL FORMS IN THE DALES

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:39.344
WHATSOEVER. MISTER CHAIR BUT

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:39.944
THAT WE GET INTO THAT'S THE

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:42.247
TYPE BIKE I GET THAT THE PET

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:44.282
ONE AND THE PET FOR A GUY I SEE

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:45.950
THAT SEPARATION I'D LIKE. ALL

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:48.720
MANUFACTURERS TO BE PEP ONE THE

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:53.758
QUESTION IS THAT. 80% OF. THE

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.593
BOTTLES THAT ARE RECYCLED NEVER

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.929
GET TO CURBSIDE THEY GO

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.464
DIRECTLY TO RECYCLING CENTER

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:01.366
THERE CO MINGLED WITH OTHER

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:03.968
PLASTICS SO THAT. YOU'RE ONLY

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:06.171
DEALING WITH 12% OF THE WORLD

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.839
AND- I KNOW A SENATOR THAT

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:09.707
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE. OF THE

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:11.409
RECYCLING TO RECYCLERS VERSUS

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.278
CURBSIDE SO THAT WORLD WOULD

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.280
SHRINK THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:16.414
THAT ABANDONED THEIR THEIR

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.917
BOTTLES SO IT'S ONLY A SMALL

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:20.285
PERCENTAGE PROBABLY SINGLE

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.420
DIGITS. AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.722
THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BUT IF

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:27.192
WE FOCUS ON THE TYPE. IT WILL

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.960
GET MORE BANG BANG OUT OF THAT

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.962
BECAUSE- THEY'LL BE THE BOTTLES

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.497
WILL BE GOING TO THE RECYCLERS

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:36.034
AND THE OTHER PLASTICS. WE GET

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.202
IN BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.037
THERE'S JUST A LOOP ON THE-

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:42.140
THE- THE- CLAM SHELLS RIDER IN

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.142
THE INCOME COLLECTING THESE

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:48.112
THINGS- IT'S A CONCERN. THAT

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.414
THE IN THE BIG IN THE LONG RUN

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.549
HI I DON'T WANT US TO CREATE A

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:55.987
BUNCH OF WORK FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:56.554
WE'RE WE'RE NOT. IT IS MORE

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.423
IMPORANT FOR US TO GET TO THE-

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:02.160
THE MANUFACTURING OF THE-

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:04.028
MATERIAL SO THAT IT'S IN TAP

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.564
ONE AND IT'S ALL IN THAT IN

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:12.503
THAT CLOSE LOOP- I URGE THE

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.106
AUTHORS TO. TO WORK ON THAT

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:18.042
BECAUSE WE HAVE A BUT- WE MAY

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:21.079
BE SHIFTING SOME COSTS HERE FOR

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:26.017
PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE- WASTE

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.786
TREATMENT PLANT PLANTS- FOR A

00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:31.289
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF RECOVERY

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.157
WHERE WE COULD TACKLE MINGLE

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.793
RATE. IF IT'S IF I'M SEPARATING

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.529
CONTAMINATION FROM MAYONNAISE

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.832
FROM CONTAMINATION WITH. ONE

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.735
IMPACT TWO AND THREE SO THAT'S

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.036
THAT'S A DIFFERENT BED I THINK

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:47.372
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THERE

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:52.310
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:54.779
THE SUBJECT JUST- LET SEVERAL

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.481
ACCOUNTS KENO- THROUGH THE

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.516
CHAIR THAT THE BEVERAGE BOTTLE

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.285
MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY HAVE

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:02.086
OTHER SIMILAR ISSUES AND SO WE

TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX AND AS WE

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:10.313
HEARD FROM SOME OF THE

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.114
OPPOSITION THERE IS A CONCERN

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:15.484
OF. THE AFTER THE MORATORIUM

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.086
BIOMETRICS AND FACIAL

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:20.389
RECOGNITION- TECHNOLOGY WHICH

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:23.826
IS IN. DEVELOPED BEING USED IN.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.362
A BODY HURT THE YEAR WITH THE

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:29.799
OPPOSITION- THE. WHAT YOU'RE

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:31.701
THINKING ON THAT EFFORT VERSUS

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:34.203
CONTINUING- EXTENDING THE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.138
SUNSET AND HAVING THE

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.374
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED. OKAY SO

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.110
THE PERSISTENT THIS REMOVES THE

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.745
SUNSET TO ALLOW COUNTY

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:46.415
RECORDERS TO CONTINUE TO. GIVE

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:49.018
VITAL RECORDS OF REMOTELY SO

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.120
THAT'S THE ONE SENSE SUNSET WE

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.255
ALIGNED IT BECAUSE OF THE

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:54.056
CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY SOME OF

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:56.225
THE PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS WE

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.460
DID SAY WE WOULD DO A THREE

01:04:57.526 --> 01:05:00.596
YEAR MORATORIUM ON ISSUES LIKE

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.898
USING BIOMETRICS OR FACIAL

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:03.899
RECOGNITION VALVE MAKE REALLY

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:06.269
CLEAR. THE MAIN THING WE WANT

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:08.337
IS TO FOLLOW NEW STANDARDS AND

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.805
WHEN ONE OF THE CALLERS SAID WE

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.141
SANCTIONED THE USE OF FACIAL

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.309
RECOGNITION WHICH IN THIS

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.411
STANDARD SAY IS NOT READY FOR

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.712
PRIME TIME I THINK THAT'S A

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:19.115
LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.149
NO STANDARDS ARE THE GOLD

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:22.018
STANDARD AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:23.853
IS PROTECT OUR VERY MOST

01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:26.188
PRIVATE INFORMATION SO. COUNTY

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.624
RECORDERS DO NOT USE FACIAL

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.726
RECOGNITION OR BIOMETRICS

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:33.296
REMOTELY THEY USE- THEY VERIFY

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.897
IDENTITIES THROUGH KNOWLEDGE

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:37.366
BASED SYSTEMS WHAT WE'RE SAYING

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:40.603
IS A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IF

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.772
THESE- TECHNOLOGY. SHOW PROMISE

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:45.007
IT WOULD BE A WAY TO GUARANTEE

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.742
YOUR PRIVACY SO THAT SOMEBODY

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:48.177
ELSE IS NOT ABLE TO GET YOUR

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.146
RECORDS SO WE WANTED TO LEAVE

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.113
THAT OPEN AND SEE HOW THE

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.149
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED. JUST AS

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:57.320
MR FIT MR TING'S BILL- DID ALSO

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.055
AND IT IS ALSO A LITTLE

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.723
DISINGENUOUS TO SAY GOVERNMENT

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.825
IS NOT ALREADY USING OF A

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.361
BIOMETRIC DATA BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.264
HAVE A NOTARIZATION OF YOUR YOU

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:10.366
KNOW A MORTGAGE OR TITLE. YOU

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.134
ARE USING BIOMETRICS THOSE ARE

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:15.004
FINGERPRINTS SO AGAIN COUNTY

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:16.972
RECORDERS HAVE NO EXPECTATION

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:18.341
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.242
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF A FEW YEARS

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.044
DOWN THE ROAD IT TURNS OUT THAT

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:23.546
THESE KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.914
START TO BE HACKED WELL THEN

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.716
YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP. A

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:31.620
WHOLE SYSTEM AT A BANK OF-

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.489
PERHAPS SOME PRINTS AND COMPARE

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.557
TO THEM NONE OF THAT IS

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:37.059
AVAILABLE CURRENTLY BUT BECAUSE

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.395
I AM THE- EURO I I'M VERY

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:41.297
INVOLVED WITH- CYBER SECURITY I

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.665
KNOW THAT THE MOST CRUCIAL

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.266
THING IS KEEPING YOUR PRIVATE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.835
INFORMATION PRIVATE WHICH IS.

01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:48.471
WHY I FIND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:51.774
OPPOSITION SO DISINGENUOUS.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.843
OKAY I MEAN BECAUSE THESE ARE

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:57.179
SOME GROUPS THAT WE- RELY ON TO

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:59.014
PROVIDE US WITH YOU KNOW WHEN

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.649
THEY'RE DEVELOPING OUR-

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:03.853
THEORIES ON- THE WHAT IS A DATA

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.454
SECURITY WHAT IS A PRIVACY

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.356
BREACH AND TRY AGAIN THEY'VE-

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.524
THEY'VE RAISED THE POINT THAT

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.127
THIS IS THE FIRST. STATUTE THAT

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:16.465
EXPLICITLY WILL ALLOW FOR- THE

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.401
USE OF FACIAL SERVING OTHERS

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.769
THREE YEARS CENTERS NO THERE IS

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.437
NO LANGUAGE ON THAT ALL THE

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.806
LANGUAGE SAYS IS THAT WE ARE

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.641
ABIDING BY THE HIGHEST SECURITY

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.576
STANDARDS WHICH IS NO STANDARDS

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.011
AND THEN. SPECIFICALLY THEY

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.913
WERE CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE-

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.549
THIS IS A VERY VERY LONG GUIDE

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.018
MENTIONS OF BIOMETRIC DATA OR

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.586
FACIAL RECOGNITION THAT THE

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.021
COUNTY RECORDER'S WOULD BE

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:41.490
USING IT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.926
USING IT. IT'S JUST LISTED IN

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:48.731
THE NEST STANDARDS. OKAY.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:51.233

ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.426
WHAT TYPES OF BIOMETRICS COULD

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.429
BE USED AFTER- IF THIS SHOULD

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.431

IT THEY ARE NOT PLANNING ON

USING IT IT'S JUST MENTIONED IN

IS A ONE WAY THAT- IT IS MUCH

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:26.128
SAFER THAN- USING YOUR PASSPORT

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.197
A PASSWORD TO MAKE SURE THAT

COLLECT FOR THE DATABASE AND

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:40.342
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPARE

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:43.145

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:59.467
ACADEMIC VALUE THAT TO DESTROY

THEM WOULD BE- SIGNIFICANT LOSS.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.676
TO THE BACKGROUND FROM THAT ERA

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:09.810
ESPECIALLY AS WE'VE GONE

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:12.680

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.685
THAT THESE THINGS OFFER

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:21.756
SIGNIFICANT VALUE. AS MANY

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.824

ROGER PLEASE- WHAT HISTORICAL

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.962

HAVE TO LEGALLY LARGECAP

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.898
SOMEONE BE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF

THEIR OWN HOME INTO THEIR OWN

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.835
PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN OFFICE. OR

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:39.573
IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM I SEE

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.375
ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE TO. CULTURE

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:44.678
TO SOCIETY TO THIS NATION OR TO

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:47.381
THE WORLD FOR ILLEGALLY GAINED

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:49.984
WIRETAPS OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:50.885
WELL I THINK YOU JUST ANSWERED

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.953
THAT. MAYBE IN YOUR EARLIER

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.221
STATEMENTS THAT THIS IS OF

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:56.090
SERVICE SUCH SYMBOLIC

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:57.892
IMPORTANCE WITH THE OVER REACH

01:34:57.958 --> 01:35:00.027
OF LA ENFORCEMENT. THAT THIS

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:01.962
IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:04.331
THINGS SHOULD NOT BE DONE. AND

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.900
WITH THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.768
HISTORICALLY BEEN ACADEMIC

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:10.538
VALUE DOES IT NOT. THE STORY OF

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:12.706
THE LEGAL WIRETAPPING ITSELF

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:15.342
DOES THE CONTENT OF THE WIRE

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:18.212
TAP NO THERE IS NO VALUE AND

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.047
WHATEVER. OFFHAND THE

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:21.849
CONVERSATIONS DR KING MIGHT

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:22.583
HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.552
ASSOCIATES FRIENDS AND FAMILY

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.821
THAT BRINGS NO VALUE WHATSOEVER

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.289
THE FACT THAT IT WAS LEGALLY

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:30.124
DONE I THINK IT'S A LESSON TO

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.892
BE LEARNED HERE WILL HOLD THIS

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:33.494
GOVERNMENT HAS INTRUDED

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.629
ESPECIALLY ON PEOPLE OF COLOR.

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:39.200
CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS FOR NUMBER

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:39.733
OF YEARS A DOCTOR KING WAS

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.469
ALIVE. IN IT F ITSELF THAT

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:42.837
STORY NEEDS TO BE TWELVE BUT

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.171
WHAT WAS RECORDED THAT WAS

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.107
CAPTURED ILLEGALLY NOT A SINGLE

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:48.042
PERSON IN THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.543
THAT WANT THEIR HOME OR THEIR

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.212
OFFICES ILLEGALLY WIRETAPPING

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:53.114
HOPE THAT. FIFTY YEARS LATER IT

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.782
WOULD BE. THOUGHT TO BE

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:56.617
EDUCATIONAL IN ANY SENSE OF THE

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:59.787
MAGIC NEXT. THANK YOU HI- I

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.989
PERSONALLY THINK THAT MANY OF

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:05.459
THE POINTS THAT MINE THAT MY-COLLEAGUE HAS HAS MADE. ARE

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:07.828
MERITORIOUS. EVEN IF WE DON'T

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:10.297
LIKE HOWEVER ON HOW THINGS

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:13.734
WERE- OBTAINED IN THIS CASE

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:17.004
PATENTLY ILLEGAL. THAT- OUR

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:20.741
SCHOLARS- WILL DRAW UPON THESE

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.743
IN THE YEARS AHEAD IN TO.

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:26.947
REMOVE FROM THE ARCHIVE. ACCESS

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:27.948

THE OTHER FOOT AND- FOLKS WERE

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.592
TRYING TO GET THE BRITISH

ARCHIVES TO DESTROY THE RECORDS

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.129
OF GANDHI I THINK THERE MIGHT

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:45.466
BE AN ISSUE- THAT WE CAN LEARN

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.535
FROM. AND I DON'T LIKE WHAT

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:49.436

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:51.038
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT WAS

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:53.707
ILLEGAL. BUT THERE IS

01:36:53.774 --> 01:36:56.277
HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE- THAT I

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:59.713
THINK WE COULD BE LOSING- IF

GUESS AT THE TIME I REACHED THE

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:01.444
POINT THAT WHY WOULD WE NOT

02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:04.447
ALLOW 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING-

02:52:04.514 --> 02:52:06.416
30% AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE-

AS WE SEE THESE THESE OF. THESE

02:52:09.852 --> 02:52:12.155
RESTRICTIONS ARE OF A POOR AND

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:13.790

BUT ENTHUSIAST AND BUILDERS I

02:52:34.844 --> 02:52:36.112
THINK THAT THESE TYPES OF

02:52:36.179 --> 02:52:37.046

02:52:43.186 --> 02:52:45.154

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:47.890
COME IN TO REMOVE THESE

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:49.492

AND WE HAD NO INTEREST IN DOING

03:15:11.166 --> 03:15:16.905
THAT. SO WHAT I KNOW OF THE AC

03:15:16.971 --> 03:15:19.741

03:15:24.345 --> 03:15:25.914
QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR

03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:29.217
FOR AC TRANSIT IS THAT. MY

03:15:29.284 --> 03:15:31.519
FIGURES SHOW THAT THE ALAMEDA

03:15:31.586 --> 03:15:34.489
COUNTY SHERIFF'S HAVE GIVEN OUT

03:15:34.556 --> 03:15:35.390
SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY KITS THAT

03:15:40.195 --> 03:15:45.900
MANY OF THEM ARE TO LOW INCOME.

03:15:45.967 --> 03:15:48.136
IN THREE YEARS SINCE TWENTY

03:15:48.203 --> 03:15:49.471
NINETEEN THERE'S ONLY BEEN

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:50.271
THIRTY TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE

03:15:50.338 --> 03:15:52.507

03:16:04.219 --> 03:16:05.553
APPEARS THAT THE PROGRAM IS

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:06.788
THERE SO WE WANT TO HAVE LOW

03:16:06.855 --> 03:16:09.023

YOU MADE WHICH IS THAT- WHAT.

03:26:38.652 --> 03:26:40.855
THIS REALLY IS A BALANCE

03:26:40.921 --> 03:26:45.693
BETWEEN- BETWEEN HAVING PEOPLE

03:26:45.760 --> 03:26:47.628
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RULES

03:26:47.695 --> 03:26:49.597
AROUND WHERE YOU CAN. WHERE YOU

03:26:49.663 --> 03:26:51.298
CAN DRIVE AND WHERE YOU

03:26:51.365 --> 03:26:53.501
SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING IT- OF

03:26:53.567 --> 03:26:56.070
SINK OR A FAMILY CAR BECAUSE

03:26:56.137 --> 03:27:00.074
IT'S A IT'S A TRANSIT- LANE AND

03:27:00.141 --> 03:27:02.409
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE TAKE

03:27:02.476 --> 03:27:03.944
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RELY ON

03:27:04.011 --> 03:27:05.312
IT AND DEPEND ON IT TO BE ON

03:27:05.379 --> 03:27:08.816
TIME AND- AND BE ABLE TO STOP

03:27:08.883 --> 03:27:10.651
AT THE STOP WHERE THEY NEED TO

03:27:10.718 --> 03:27:13.287
GET OFF AND- AND YOU KNOW A LOT

03:27:13.354 --> 03:27:15.189
OF TIME TO MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT.

03:27:15.256 --> 03:27:16.490
WELL YOU KNOW POOR PEOPLE ARE

03:27:16.557 --> 03:27:18.025
GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY IT BUT

03:27:18.092 --> 03:27:21.128
I'M I'M IMPRESSED BY HOW- YOU

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:22.696
YOU STRUCTURED IT SO THAT

03:27:22.763 --> 03:27:24.565
THERE'S SOME OPTIONS THERE'S A

03:27:24.632 --> 03:27:25.800
PUBLIC EDUCATION DISTRICT

03:27:25.866 --> 03:27:28.169
THERE'S- WARNINGS AND THEN

03:27:28.235 --> 03:27:31.172
THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY WITH

03:27:31.238 --> 03:27:33.107
THE TRANSIT AGENCY TO BE ABLE

03:27:33.174 --> 03:27:36.143
TO DECIDE. TO FORGIVE A FINER

03:27:36.210 --> 03:27:37.511
TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A

03:27:37.578 --> 03:27:38.813
DIFFERENT WAY FOR IT TO BE PAID

03:27:38.879 --> 03:27:41.081
AND- AND THE REALITY THE

03:27:41.148 --> 03:27:42.416
SITUATION IS THAT POOR PEOPLE

03:27:42.483 --> 03:27:44.552
HAVE NO CHOICE MANY TIMES THEY

03:27:44.618 --> 03:27:45.152
HAVE TO TAKE PUBLIC

03:27:45.219 --> 03:27:47.354
TRANSPORTATION AND IT REALLY IS

03:27:47.421 --> 03:27:49.056
IMPORTANT THAT IT BE ON TIME

03:27:49.123 --> 03:27:49.990
AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE I

03:27:50.057 --> 03:27:52.293
HAVE WITH. WITH THE DETRACTORS

03:27:52.359 --> 03:27:56.297
OF THE CAMERAS IS THAT- IF YOU

03:27:56.363 --> 03:27:58.699
DON'T ENFORCE. PEOPLE DON'T PAY

03:27:58.766 --> 03:28:00.968
ATTENTION. AND I DON'T KNOW

03:28:01.035 --> 03:28:02.670
ABOUT YOU BUT THESE RED LIGHT.

03:28:02.736 --> 03:28:04.238
PEOPLE WHO RUN RED LIGHTS DRIVE

03:28:04.305 --> 03:28:06.674
ME CRAZY. BECAUSE IF I MOVED

03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:08.042
WHEN IT TURNED GREEN I'D BE

03:28:08.108 --> 03:28:10.811
BROADSIDED MANY TIMES AND SO.

03:28:10.878 --> 03:28:12.880
AND PART OF THE PART OF THE

03:28:12.947 --> 03:28:13.414
CHALLENGES WE HAVE STOPPED

03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:15.950
ENFORCING. RED LIGHT WITH

03:28:16.016 --> 03:28:18.519
PATROLS AND SO THIS IS A VERY

03:28:18.586 --> 03:28:22.289
SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE I'M AT.

03:28:22.356 --> 03:28:24.258
NOT ENFORCING OR NOT HAVING

03:28:24.325 --> 03:28:26.126
ENOUGH STAFF TO ENFORCE THE

03:28:26.193 --> 03:28:27.361
RULES ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD

03:28:27.428 --> 03:28:29.129
GO IF YOU IF YOU DON'T DO THE

03:28:29.196 --> 03:28:30.064
ENFORCEMENT THEN IT BECOMES

03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:32.366
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND

03:28:32.433 --> 03:28:34.335
I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT

03:28:34.401 --> 03:28:35.502

03:28:35.569 --> 03:28:36.904

03:28:39.974 --> 03:28:41.675
THE LOSS IN ONCE THEY GET A

03:28:41.742 --> 03:28:43.010
WARNING ONCE THEY THEY FIND OUT

03:28:43.077 --> 03:28:45.246
THAT- THAT THAT IT IS GOING TO

03:28:45.312 --> 03:28:46.480
BE ENFORCED I DON'T THINK WE'RE

03:28:46.547 --> 03:28:47.681

03:46:00.613 --> 03:46:03.049
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE IN HAS

03:46:03.116 --> 03:46:05.385
BEEN A GAME CHANGER. AND WE'RE

03:46:05.451 --> 03:46:07.720

IS INCORPORATED INTO OR OR

03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:16.996
DAILY LIFE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT

03:46:17.063 --> 03:46:19.032
I THINK THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS

03:46:19.098 --> 03:46:21.567
BILL RIGHT HERE IS THAT. A. I.

03:46:21.634 --> 03:46:23.670
IS BUILT ON DATA. AND

03:46:23.736 --> 03:46:26.172
PREDICTIVE DATA. SO THAT POLICY

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:29.776
MAKERS OR- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

03:46:29.842 --> 03:46:30.810
THE CONSUMERS OF THAT

03:46:30.877 --> 03:46:33.446

IN- TO THE INFORMATION

03:46:43.623 --> 03:46:46.192
GATHERING ALGORITHM. AND THAT

03:46:46.259 --> 03:46:47.593
IS PROBLEMATIC AND THEN

03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:49.963
SOMETIMES IT IS SELF REALIZING

03:46:50.029 --> 03:46:52.865
OVER TIME. I THINK THERE'S TWO

03:46:52.932 --> 03:46:54.367
THINGS THAT THEY CAN MAKE THIS

03:46:54.434 --> 03:46:56.202

03:47:07.413 --> 03:47:10.316

03:47:10.383 --> 03:47:13.519
FORCIBLY DISCLOSING INFORMATION

03:47:13.586 --> 03:47:15.688
ABOUT THE UNDERLYING FACTUAL

03:47:15.755 --> 03:47:17.523
ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO A

03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:19.625
PLATFORM LIKE THIS. COULD

03:47:19.692 --> 03:47:21.194
REALLY COULD REVEAL PROPRIETARY

03:47:21.260 --> 03:47:23.863
INFORMATION SO THE IDEA OF

03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:27.100
MAKING THE FINDINGS ARE PUBLIC

03:47:27.166 --> 03:47:28.735
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLY DANGEROUS

03:47:28.801 --> 03:47:29.669
ANIMAL DISINCENTIVE EYES

03:47:29.736 --> 03:47:32.872
BUSINESS FROM WANTING TO MOVE

03:47:32.939 --> 03:47:35.575
INTO PUBLIC CONTRACTS. AND SO

03:47:35.641 --> 03:47:36.376
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I

03:47:36.442 --> 03:47:38.144
HAD TO YOU AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO

03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:39.612

03:47:39.679 --> 03:47:42.682
MERITORIOUS OR NOT IS NOT

03:47:42.749 --> 03:47:44.951
MAKING THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC.

03:47:45.018 --> 03:47:46.786
IN ANY FASHION THAT WOULD

03:47:46.853 --> 03:47:48.821
REVEAL THE INTELLECTUAL OUR OUR

03:47:48.888 --> 03:47:54.360
PRODUCT. THE OTHER IS- THERE

03:47:54.427 --> 03:47:55.962
SHOULD BE A SELF CORRECTING

03:47:56.029 --> 03:47:58.197
AUDIT SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S

03:47:58.264 --> 03:48:01.234
THROUGH THE- MEDIC IN THE- THE

03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:02.802
RISK ASSESSMENT OR WHATEVER THE

03:48:02.869 --> 03:48:04.704
REPORTING TERMINOLOGIES USED IN

03:48:04.771 --> 03:48:07.373
HERE IS THAT IF AN ALGORITHM

03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:11.010
REVEALS A DISPARATE IMPACT FOR

03:48:11.077 --> 03:48:12.445
AN UNINTENTIONAL DISPARATE

03:48:12.512 --> 03:48:14.514
IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS BEING

03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:17.150
SINGLED OUT BY VIRTUE OF THE

03:48:17.216 --> 03:48:18.918
AREA MODELING. THAT THERE BE A

03:48:18.985 --> 03:48:21.354
CORRECTIVE INTERNAL PROCESS

03:48:21.421 --> 03:48:23.689
THAT THE STICKER PARTICIPATE IN.

03:48:23.756 --> 03:48:25.458
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

03:48:25.525 --> 03:48:26.292
HAVE I THINK ONE OF THE CALLERS

03:48:26.359 --> 03:48:27.894
POINT OUT IS THAT DO WE HAVE

03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:29.929
THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO GET

03:48:29.996 --> 03:48:32.231
INTO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND

03:48:32.298 --> 03:48:34.000
I THINK- WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT

03:48:34.067 --> 03:48:36.936
TOGETHER- THIS I THINK WOULD BE

03:48:37.003 --> 03:48:40.640
A PERFECT- BUILD TO MOVE INTO A

03:48:40.706 --> 03:48:41.441

CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL WE

THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMERS

04:17:05.977 --> 04:17:07.512
FIRST OFF THE BILL IS CONFUSING

04:17:07.578 --> 04:17:09.614
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH

04:17:09.680 --> 04:17:11.015
THE BILL REQUIRES A RETAIL

WON'T THAT GIVES SOME A CHILD

04:17:31.769 --> 04:17:33.004
OR ACTIVIST A REASON TO

04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:35.006

PRODUCTS TO ONE SEX OR ANOTHER.

04:17:52.857 --> 04:17:54.792
RETAIL STORES HAVE A RIGHT TO

04:17:54.859 --> 04:17:56.460
BE LEFT ALONE TO DECIDE HOW

04:17:56.527 --> 04:17:58.396
BEST TO MARKET THE PRODUCTS TO

04:17:58.462 --> 04:18:00.231
THEIR CUSTOMERS BASED ON WHAT

04:18:00.298 --> 04:18:02.066
MARKET RESEARCH TELLS THEM THE

04:18:02.133 --> 04:18:04.235
CONSUMERS WANT. IT WILL NOT BE

IS THAT WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP

04:37:29.232 --> 04:37:31.735
IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE. I WAS

04:37:31.801 --> 04:37:34.004

WASN'T RIGHT. IT WOULD. ARE

04:38:00.430 --> 04:38:01.431
THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY

04:38:01.498 --> 04:38:03.566
THROUGH THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE

04:38:03.633 --> 04:38:05.402

DOCUMENTS THAT STUFF LOOKS

04:40:01.851 --> 04:40:03.753
LOOKS OUT BUT ULTIMATELY THE

04:40:03.820 --> 04:40:05.855
BOARD AS FIDUCIARIES ARE

04:40:05.922 --> 04:40:07.290
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL INVESTMENT

04:40:07.357 --> 04:40:08.758
DECISIONS THEN THEY SET THE

04:40:08.825 --> 04:40:11.694
POLICIES AND DELEGATE.

04:40:11.761 --> 04:40:12.962
AUTHORITY TO STAFF TO MAKE

04:40:13.029 --> 04:40:14.564
THOSE INVESTMENTS BUT THE STAFF

04:40:14.631 --> 04:40:16.166
MUST KEEP THE BOARD INFORMED OF

04:40:16.232 --> 04:40:17.100
THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'RE

04:40:17.167 --> 04:40:18.735
MAKING WHILE THEY'RE GOING

04:40:18.801 --> 04:40:20.203
THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THEY ARE

04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:22.605
KEPT INFORMED THEIR PROVIDED

04:40:22.672 --> 04:40:23.873
INFORMATION AS THE BILL'S GOING

04:40:23.940 --> 04:40:25.708
AS OF PROPOSALS GOING THROUGH

04:40:25.775 --> 04:40:28.411
DUE DILIGENCE ONCE A PROPOSAL

04:40:28.478 --> 04:40:31.614
IS- FINALIZED UNDER THEIR BOARD

04:40:31.681 --> 04:40:34.350
DELEGATED AUTHORITY AT ANY ANY

04:40:34.417 --> 04:40:37.453
TIME SOMETHING FALLS OUT OF

04:40:37.520 --> 04:40:38.721
THE- OUT OF THE- IS. OUT OF THE

04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:40.256
BOARD POLICY OR DELEGATED

04:40:40.323 --> 04:40:41.457
AUTHORITY THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

04:40:41.524 --> 04:40:42.225
BRING THAT TO THE BOARD'S

04:40:42.292 --> 04:40:43.493
ATTENTION AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE

04:40:43.560 --> 04:40:44.427
GOING TO BRING ANY OTHER

04:40:44.494 --> 04:40:45.895
PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE WITH

04:40:45.962 --> 04:40:48.498
THAT. ENTITY THAT MAY IMPACT

04:40:48.565 --> 04:40:49.532
THE INVESTMENT TO THE BOARD'S

04:40:49.599 --> 04:40:51.534
ATTENTION THEN THEN MAYBE I

04:40:51.601 --> 04:40:52.669
SHOULD GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

04:40:52.735 --> 04:40:55.238
QUESTION OF THE LAST HEARING.

04:40:55.305 --> 04:40:56.673
AND THAT QUESTION WAS

04:40:56.739 --> 04:40:59.209
BASICALLY- IF THE BOARD IS

04:40:59.275 --> 04:41:01.644
RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING FEES

04:41:01.711 --> 04:41:03.880
OR HAS THE ACCOUNTABILITY HOW

04:41:03.947 --> 04:41:06.916
DID THEY KNOW. ONE ONE OF THE

04:41:06.983 --> 04:41:08.551
POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS IS

04:41:08.618 --> 04:41:11.187
FLAWED BECAUSE THE ANSWER THAT

04:41:11.254 --> 04:41:11.955
THREW US OFF IN THE LAST

04:41:12.021 --> 04:41:14.591
HEARING WAS. THEY COULD REQUEST

04:41:14.657 --> 04:41:17.260
PAPERS OR BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS

04:41:17.327 --> 04:41:19.429
ABOUT ANY TRANSACTION BUT THEY

04:41:19.495 --> 04:41:21.064
WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT

04:41:21.130 --> 04:41:22.999
TRANSACTION IS FLAWED OR

04:41:23.066 --> 04:41:24.534
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND

04:41:24.601 --> 04:41:26.736
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET AT. IS

04:41:26.803 --> 04:41:28.104
HOW WAS THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY

04:41:28.171 --> 04:41:29.572
HOW DO THEY KNOW WITHOUT THEM

04:41:29.639 --> 04:41:31.241
HAVING TO GUESS WHERE THERE'S A

04:41:31.307 --> 04:41:33.276
PROBLEM. IN A WAY THAT THERE'S

04:41:33.343 --> 04:41:35.311
TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY BY KEEPING

04:41:35.378 --> 04:41:37.146
THIS PRIVATE. BUT HAVING A

04:41:37.213 --> 04:41:39.749
PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD THAT IS

04:41:39.816 --> 04:41:43.119
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANNA. ANNA OKAY

04:41:43.186 --> 04:41:44.287
AND THE REASON I GO BACK TO

04:41:44.354 --> 04:41:45.655
THAT QUESTION IS I'M NOT SURE

04:41:45.722 --> 04:41:47.156
YOU JUST AGREED TO THE

04:41:47.223 --> 04:41:48.591
STATEMENT THAT I READ TO YOU

04:41:48.658 --> 04:41:50.326
THAT ONE OF THE ADVOCATES GAVE

04:41:50.393 --> 04:41:52.161
TO ME. THAT ADDRESSES THAT

04:41:52.228 --> 04:41:54.497
ISSUE SO LET'S GO BACK TO THAT.

04:41:54.564 --> 04:41:56.499
SO HOW DO WE KNOW THERE'S

04:41:56.566 --> 04:41:58.201
ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE BOARD

04:41:58.268 --> 04:42:00.470
IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN YOUR

04:42:00.536 --> 04:42:01.704
UNIT ADDRESSING THAT TO MISTER

04:42:01.771 --> 04:42:04.207
BROWN OR YES ANDREW THE CHAIR

04:42:04.274 --> 04:42:05.475
TO MISTER BROWN SORRY WE WERE

04:42:05.541 --> 04:42:09.212
HAVING A DIALOGUE SO- SURE- SO

04:42:09.279 --> 04:42:13.049
THE- STAFF. BRINGS THOSE TO THE

04:42:13.116 --> 04:42:14.417
BOARD'S ATTENTION THE BOARD

04:42:14.484 --> 04:42:16.386
REQUIRES CERTAIN INFORMATION TO

04:42:16.452 --> 04:42:18.655
COME TO THE BOARD- FOR THESE

04:42:18.721 --> 04:42:20.156
INVESTMENTS SO THOSE WOULD BE

04:42:20.223 --> 04:42:21.157
BROUGHT TO THE BOARD'S

04:42:21.224 --> 04:42:23.293
ATTENTION FROM FROM STAFF THEY

04:42:23.359 --> 04:42:23.893
COULD ALSO BE BROUGHT TO THE

04:42:23.960 --> 04:42:25.561
BOARD'S ATTENTION. THROUGH

04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:28.831
THEIR- INDEPENDENT. CONSULTANT

04:42:28.898 --> 04:42:30.733
THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT TO

04:42:30.800 --> 04:42:32.502
OVERSEE THE INVESTMENTS AND

04:42:32.568 --> 04:42:34.170
THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY MAY PICK UP

04:42:34.237 --> 04:42:35.405
SOMETHING THEMSELVES FOR A

04:42:35.471 --> 04:42:38.875
STAKEHOLDER. NEWSPAPER OR

04:42:38.941 --> 04:42:39.375
SOMETHING COMES TO THEIR

04:42:39.442 --> 04:42:39.909
ATTENTION THEY MAY I STAFF

04:42:39.976 --> 04:42:41.044
THOSE SO. I THINK THERE'S A

04:42:41.110 --> 04:42:41.944
NUMBER OF AVENUES BUT

04:42:42.011 --> 04:42:43.880
ULTIMATELY. I THINK IT'S THE

04:42:43.946 --> 04:42:44.881
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

04:42:44.947 --> 04:42:48.384
INVESTMENT TEAM TO- FIGURE

04:42:48.451 --> 04:42:49.852
THOSE THINGS OUT AND BRING

04:42:49.919 --> 04:42:50.453
THOSE TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

04:42:50.520 --> 04:42:52.355
SO THEY'RE AWARE OF THE- WEAR

04:42:52.422 --> 04:42:52.922
OF THEM THEYCAN GIVE THEM

04:42:52.989 --> 04:42:55.825
EXTRA SCRUTINY. IF THEY NEED TO.

04:42:55.892 --> 04:43:00.463
THEN. OKAY THEN LET ME DRIVE

04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:02.465
THIS IS A THIRD WAY IF IT'S

04:43:02.532 --> 04:43:06.536
OKAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. BOMB.

04:43:06.602 --> 04:43:08.037
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING

04:43:08.104 --> 04:43:09.439
DOESN'T GO ON FOR A WHILE

04:43:09.505 --> 04:43:10.673
BEFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO THE

04:43:10.740 --> 04:43:13.042
ATTENTION OF THE BOARD R. I

04:43:13.109 --> 04:43:15.445

04:43:15.511 --> 04:43:19.315
LEAP HERE AND I THINK IN

04:43:19.382 --> 04:43:21.351

ACCOUNTABILITY AND ABILITY TO

04:43:26.723 --> 04:43:30.493
GET ON A PROBLEM IN SHORT ORDER.

04:43:30.560 --> 04:43:34.230
I MEAN THE- WELL THE WAY TOO

04:43:34.297 --> 04:43:36.099
FAR AWAY FROM THE C. SPEAKER

ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL

04:43:43.806 --> 04:43:45.508
INVESTMENTS AND THEN THE STAFF

04:43:45.575 --> 04:43:47.110
ALSO HAS A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO

04:43:47.176 --> 04:43:48.811
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MAKING.

04:43:48.878 --> 04:43:49.879

CONTINUE THAT QUEST FOR

04:45:14.096 --> 04:45:15.898
ADEQUATE TRANSPARENCY AND STILL

04:45:15.965 --> 04:45:18.167
FULFILLING THE GOAL WHICH IS-

04:45:18.234 --> 04:45:20.803
MAKING SURE THAT IN A- WAY THAT

04:45:20.870 --> 04:45:22.905
THE TAXPAYERS CAN BE PROUD OF.

04:45:22.972 --> 04:45:24.740

04:45:30.646 --> 04:45:32.014
TRY TO MEET BOTH OF THOSE

04:45:32.081 --> 04:45:33.683
GOALS- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS

04:45:33.749 --> 04:45:36.419
TODAY- YOU'VE ADDED A SUNSET

04:45:36.486 --> 04:45:38.821
WE'VE ADDED A SUNSET AND ALSO.

04:45:38.888 --> 04:45:41.290
A PROVISION THAT UP PROVIDED

04:45:41.357 --> 04:45:42.758
FOR THE TRANSPARENCY AS TO THE

04:45:42.825 --> 04:45:46.362
CONSTITUENT OWNERS. BUT I TRUST

04:45:46.429 --> 04:45:47.730
YOU WILL CONTINUE THAT QUEST.

04:45:47.797 --> 04:45:48.598
TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY

04:45:48.664 --> 04:45:50.399

BACK TO YOU MR THANK YOU I JUST

04:45:54.670 --> 04:45:58.875
HAVE A CUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS-

04:45:58.941 --> 04:46:00.910
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR MAYBE MISTER

04:46:00.977 --> 04:46:03.679
BROWN- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

04:46:03.746 --> 04:46:05.515
THAT THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION OF

04:46:05.581 --> 04:46:08.951
A 7% RETURN- THAT HAS NOW I

04:46:09.018 --> 04:46:10.686
THINK DROPPED AROUND. MAYBE SIX

04:46:10.753 --> 04:46:12.488
POINT EIGHT BUT IN REAL TERMS

04:46:12.555 --> 04:46:14.257
IT'S AROUND SIX DOES THAT SOUND

04:46:14.323 --> 04:46:23.666
ACCURATE. THEREABOUTS. SO IT

04:46:23.733 --> 04:46:25.167
DID GO DOWN TO SIX POINT EIGHT

04:46:25.234 --> 04:46:26.569
DUE TO A RISK MITIGATION

04:46:26.636 --> 04:46:27.970
STRATEGY AS A RESULT OF OUR

04:46:28.037 --> 04:46:30.506
RECENT- RETURN RETURNS IN THE

04:46:30.573 --> 04:46:32.708
20% RANGE BUT THE BOARD IS

04:46:32.775 --> 04:46:33.676
CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE

04:46:33.743 --> 04:46:35.344
ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

04:46:35.411 --> 04:46:37.346
CYCLE NOW ALSO THAT DECISION IS

04:46:37.413 --> 04:46:39.148
NOT GOING TO BE MADE TO LATER

04:46:39.215 --> 04:46:40.917
THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR AS

04:46:40.983 --> 04:46:42.318
TO WHETHER THE DISCOUNT RATE

04:46:42.385 --> 04:46:43.319
WILL GO DOWN EITHER EVEN

04:46:43.386 --> 04:46:44.387
FURTHER IT'S REALLY A POOR

04:46:44.453 --> 04:46:45.988
DECISION AND SO WE'RE JUST

04:46:46.055 --> 04:46:47.189
GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT

04:46:47.256 --> 04:46:48.658
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO DOWN

04:46:48.724 --> 04:46:50.593
FURTHER THAN SIX POINT EIGHT.

04:46:50.660 --> 04:46:55.798
OKAY AND- IF THERE IS IF THERE

04:46:55.865 --> 04:46:58.668
IS A LOSS- WHAT IS THE STATE'S

04:46:58.734 --> 04:47:01.170
ROLE. AT SOME POINT IF THERE IS

04:47:01.237 --> 04:47:03.940
SUBSTANTIAL LOSS. OF THE STATE

04:47:04.006 --> 04:47:06.676
IS EXPECTED TO STEP IN AND MAKE

04:47:06.742 --> 04:47:07.276
A CONTRIBUTION IS THAT IS THAT

04:47:07.343 --> 04:47:10.646
ACCURATE. IT IS ACCURATE FOR

04:47:10.713 --> 04:47:12.782

FOR THE STATE GOT IT GOT IT. I

04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:28.898
THINK THERE'S SOME STRONG

04:47:28.965 --> 04:47:31.133
ARGUMENTS BACK AND FORTH ON

04:47:31.200 --> 04:47:34.136
THIS CALPERS WANTING TO- PURSUE

04:47:34.203 --> 04:47:38.808
MORE- RISKY BUT- LUCRATIVE-

04:47:38.874 --> 04:47:41.844
INVESTMENTS. ARE TO DRIVE UP ON

04:47:41.911 --> 04:47:43.212
THE PRTFOLIO AND THEN OF

04:47:46.048 --> 04:47:48.951
EXPECTATION OF ACCESS GIVEN IT

04:47:49.018 --> 04:47:50.886
BEING A PUBLIC. SEMI PUBLIC

04:47:50.953 --> 04:47:53.723
ENTITY. BUT THIS IS BECAUSE

04:47:53.789 --> 04:47:56.525

KEEPING INFORMATION- EXAM FROM

THE TRADITIONAL- ACCESS POINTS

04:48:08.838 --> 04:48:13.142
FROM THE PUBLIC- SO I THINK. I

04:48:13.209 --> 04:48:16.746
IS THERE NOT A- HYBRID WHERE

THE LEGISLATURE. SO WHILE I

06:07:49.480 --> 06:07:50.982

THAT WE IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE

06:07:53.184 --> 06:07:54.952
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROPERTY

06:07:55.019 --> 06:07:57.321

06:07:59.657 --> 06:08:02.326
BLACKSTONE HAVE TO REVEAL.

06:08:02.393 --> 06:08:04.929

ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ALL RIGHT

06:08:15.173 --> 06:08:18.576
I THINK THAT'S PROFESSOR PARK

06:08:18.643 --> 06:08:19.177
WHAT WOULD BLACKSTONE HAVE TO

06:08:19.243 --> 06:08:23.214
REVEAL. WHAT WOULD LASH DON'T

06:08:23.281 --> 06:08:24.582
HAVE TO REVEAL I MEAN ISN'T

06:08:24.649 --> 06:08:26.851
THAT BILL JUST 25% BENEFICIAL

06:08:26.918 --> 06:08:28.352
OWNERSHIP INTEREST I DON'T KNOW

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

06:08:32.123 --> 06:08:34.358
SO BLACKSTONE WOULDN'T REVEAL

06:08:34.425 --> 06:08:37.829
ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT. I DON'T

06:08:37.895 --> 06:08:39.730

06:08:46.838 --> 06:08:48.272
WOULD HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHICH

06:08:48.339 --> 06:08:50.341
SEEMS REASONABLE RIGHT HOWEVER

06:08:50.408 --> 06:08:51.776
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

06:08:51.843 --> 06:08:53.945
PROPERTY INSURANCE. ANALYTICS

06:08:54.011 --> 06:08:56.047

PERSON WOULD BE ULTIMATELY

06:09:01.619 --> 06:09:02.119
WOULD BE THE PERSON I WOULD

06:09:02.186 --> 06:09:07.525
HAVE TO REPORT. ALL RIGHT SO.

06:09:07.592 --> 06:09:09.060

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS

06:09:10.595 --> 06:09:12.129
WOULD BE THE GENERAL MANAGER OF

A PARTNER WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO.

06:09:14.832 --> 06:09:16.501

06:09:28.913 --> 06:09:30.014
QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING

06:09:30.081 --> 06:09:32.149
DETERMINED BY COURTS OF LAW IT

06:09:32.216 --> 06:09:33.251
WILL BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT

06:09:33.317 --> 06:09:34.619
JURISDICTIONS BUT THIS IS THE

06:09:34.685 --> 06:09:36.153
QUESTION THAT COURTS ARE

06:09:36.220 --> 06:09:36.988
DEALING WITH IT BECAUSE IT

06:09:37.054 --> 06:09:39.991
ARISES- BECAUSE- SUCH FIGURES

06:09:40.057 --> 06:09:42.927
AND ENTITIES. ARE ARE HELD

06:09:42.994 --> 06:09:44.595
ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT FOR THEIR

06:09:44.662 --> 06:09:46.597

06:09:46.664 --> 06:09:48.499
TIME THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE

06:09:48.566 --> 06:09:50.735
YOU GOING TO MAKE IT BEAT. TO

06:09:50.801 --> 06:09:51.669
BRING THEM INTO COURT IN THE

06:09:51.736 --> 06:09:53.037
FIRST PLACE THAT'S REALLY THE

06:09:53.104 --> 06:09:56.741
QUESTION HERE BUT THEN WHAT

06:09:56.807 --> 06:09:57.375
WOULD THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

06:09:57.441 --> 06:10:00.578
BE. IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR

06:10:00.645 --> 06:10:02.747
ENSURING THAT- INSURING THAT

06:10:02.813 --> 06:10:04.081
THE INFORMATION REQUESTED IT

06:10:04.148 --> 06:10:05.416
ACTUALLY REPORTED IT BUT THE

06:10:05.483 --> 06:10:07.318
QUESTION SIR WELL FOR VIOLATION

06:10:07.385 --> 06:10:09.153
OF SHOULD THIS LAW BE ENACTED

06:10:09.220 --> 06:10:10.922
WHAT WITH THE ENFORCEMENT

06:10:10.988 --> 06:10:13.558
MECHANISM BE. IT WELL I THINK

06:10:13.624 --> 06:10:15.026
THAT THEY'RE WHATEVER-

06:10:15.092 --> 06:10:16.327
MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE TO

06:10:16.394 --> 06:10:18.162
ENSURE REPORTING OF OTHER KINDS

06:10:18.229 --> 06:10:19.196
OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE

06:10:19.263 --> 06:10:21.699
ALREADY BUSINESS ENTITIES ARE

06:10:21.766 --> 06:10:24.101
REQUIRED AND YOU KNOW- TO

06:10:24.168 --> 06:10:25.403
REGISTER AND PROVIDE ALL KINDS

06:10:25.469 --> 06:10:26.604
OF INFORMATION JUST NOT

06:10:26.671 --> 06:10:28.105
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP WITH THE

06:10:28.172 --> 06:10:29.240
SIMPLY JUST ADDING ONE MORE

06:10:29.307 --> 06:10:31.776
LINE. TO AN EXISTING PRACTICE

06:10:31.842 --> 06:10:34.145
AN EXISTING KIND OF FORM- AND

06:10:34.211 --> 06:10:36.480
SO IT WOULD UPDATE REGULARLY

06:10:36.547 --> 06:10:37.815
ADDS FILING WITH THE SECRETARY

06:10:37.882 --> 06:10:42.019
OF STATE ARE SUPPOSED TO-

06:10:42.086 --> 06:10:42.520
REGULARLY BE UPDATED AND

06:10:42.587 --> 06:10:44.755
REFRESHED. BUT SO IF FOR

06:10:44.822 --> 06:10:49.093
EXAMPLE A CORPORATION- WITH.

06:10:49.160 --> 06:10:51.228
SAY TWENTY OWNERS OR TWENTY

06:10:51.295 --> 06:10:53.130
SHAREHOLDERS- THEY NEED ONLY

06:10:53.197 --> 06:10:53.965
LIST THE NAME OF THE

06:10:54.031 --> 06:10:56.901
CORPORATION ASSUMING EACH OF

06:10:56.968 --> 06:11:00.404
EQUAL SHARE IS THAT RIGHT. IT

06:11:00.471 --> 06:11:02.106
SOUNDS THAT WAY THE LAN I.

06:11:02.173 --> 06:11:04.609
PRESENTS BUDGETS BY TWENTY FIVE

06:11:04.675 --> 06:11:07.178
PERCENT- INTEREST HOLDING

06:11:07.244 --> 06:11:09.380
BENEFICIAL OWNERS. BUT IF MY

06:11:09.447 --> 06:11:10.881
WIFE AND I BOUGHT- FORMED AN

06:11:10.948 --> 06:11:13.084
LLC AND BOUGHT A UNIT THEN WE

06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:15.219
WOULD NEED TO NAME OUR

06:11:15.286 --> 06:11:17.989
INDIVIDUAL NAMES IS THAT RIGHT.

06:11:18.055 --> 06:11:21.559
THAT'S CORRECT I SEE. OKAY IN

06:11:21.626 --> 06:11:24.695
WHAT. I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL.

06:11:24.762 --> 06:11:26.831
IT SAYS UNIVERSITY. WHAT IS THE

06:11:26.897 --> 06:11:29.133
DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL

06:11:29.200 --> 06:11:31.102
ECONOMIC BENEFIT I SEE THAT

06:11:31.168 --> 06:11:31.836
SOMEONE WHO RECEIVES

06:11:31.902 --> 06:11:33.971
SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS

06:11:34.038 --> 06:11:36.240
MUST ALSO BE LISTED AS A

06:11:36.307 --> 06:11:37.708
BENEFICIAL OWNER WHAT WHAT'S

06:11:37.775 --> 06:11:39.543
THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL

06:11:39.610 --> 06:11:44.382
ECONOMIC BENEFITS. SUBSTANTIAL

06:11:44.448 --> 06:11:45.916
ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS AGAIN LIKE

06:11:45.983 --> 06:11:46.984
I SAID SOMETHING THAT BEING

06:11:47.051 --> 06:11:48.886
DETERMINED BY THE COURT I MEAN

06:11:48.953 --> 06:11:49.720
IT'S GING TO DIFFER A LITTLE

06:11:49.787 --> 06:11:50.755
BIT JERK DICTION TO

06:11:50.821 --> 06:11:51.889
JURISDICTION SO I WOULD

06:11:51.956 --> 06:11:53.624
HESITATE TO SAY EXACTLY. I'M

06:11:53.691 --> 06:11:54.592
NOT EVEN SURE WHAT YOU'RE

06:11:54.659 --> 06:11:55.726
THINKING YOU'RE THINKING OF

06:11:55.793 --> 06:11:59.363
RIGHT NOW- BYE YOU KNOW IT'S

06:11:59.430 --> 06:12:00.698
FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD RICH

06:12:00.765 --> 06:12:03.100
WRIST THE INCOME STREAM THAT IS

06:12:03.167 --> 06:12:04.969
SUBSTANTIAL RELIED YOU KNOW

06:12:05.036 --> 06:12:07.004
SOME QUANTITY THAT- IT'S

06:12:07.071 --> 06:12:10.374
SIZEABLE- IN TERMS OF IN TERMS

06:12:10.441 --> 06:12:13.411
OF ECONOMICS- BENEFIT FROM THE

06:12:13.477 --> 06:12:14.512
PROPERTY ITSELF FROM THE

06:12:14.578 --> 06:12:19.116
OWNERSHIP- THAT SORT OF THING

06:12:19.183 --> 06:12:19.717
THAT PROBABLY THE MOST OBVIOUS

06:12:19.784 --> 06:12:20.451
EXAMPLE. SO IF THIS LET'S

06:12:20.518 --> 06:12:21.285
ASSUME THIS IS A CIVIL

06:12:21.352 --> 06:12:23.721
VIOLATION. AND IF A JUDGE WOULD

06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:25.723
INSTRUCT THE JURY HOW WOULD

06:12:25.790 --> 06:12:26.857
THAT JUDGE HOW WOULD SHE

06:12:26.924 --> 06:12:28.025
INSTRUCTS THE JURY AS TO WHAT A

06:12:28.092 --> 06:12:29.894
SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT

06:12:29.960 --> 06:12:31.796
IS. FOR PURPOSES OF ISOLATION

06:12:31.862 --> 06:12:35.433
ALONG. IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE JUST

06:12:35.499 --> 06:12:36.033
REFERRING TO CALIFORNIA LAW AT

06:12:36.100 --> 06:12:39.203
THIS POINT. I'M ACTUALLY IN

06:12:39.270 --> 06:12:40.404
WASHINGTON DC IF I'M NOT

06:12:40.471 --> 06:12:41.605
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA

06:12:41.672 --> 06:12:43.274
LAW SAYS ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S A

06:12:43.340 --> 06:12:45.509
FAIRLY INTUITIVE DEFINITION YOU

06:12:45.576 --> 06:12:46.177
KNOW IT'S A FAIRLY

06:12:46.243 --> 06:12:48.212
COMMONSENSICAL IDEA THAT IF

06:12:48.279 --> 06:12:49.580
SOMEONE GETS A SUBSTANTIAL

06:12:49.647 --> 06:12:52.516
AMOUNT OF INCOME- FROM. SOME

06:12:52.583 --> 06:12:54.819
KIND OF PROPERTY HOLDINGS- THAT

06:12:54.885 --> 06:12:55.920
THAT WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL

06:12:55.986 --> 06:12:58.589
ECONOMIC BENEFITS- YOU KNOW I

06:12:58.656 --> 06:13:00.658
THINK. I DON'T KNOW TO TELL YOU

06:13:00.725 --> 06:13:01.892
WHAT IT REALLY COMMONSENSICAL

06:13:01.959 --> 06:13:02.993
IF YOU'RE ASKING EXACTLY WHERE

06:13:03.060 --> 06:13:04.829
THE LINE IS I THINK YOU KNOW

06:13:04.895 --> 06:13:07.098
THAT WILL DEPEND ON LOTS OF-

06:13:07.164 --> 06:13:08.165
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE

06:13:08.232 --> 06:13:13.671
CASE- BUT THE FAIRLY AGAIN

06:13:13.738 --> 06:13:14.538
INTUITIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD. FIVE

06:13:14.605 --> 06:13:17.408
OF- TYPE OF PROVISION SO WOULD

06:13:17.475 --> 06:13:18.776
THAT BE THE JURY INSTRUCTION

06:13:18.843 --> 06:13:20.010
THAT A JUDGE WOULD GIVE TO A

06:13:20.077 --> 06:13:21.779

TO WHY- WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF

06:51:14.316 --> 06:51:16.351
STRIPPING AS P. B. AT THE AT

06:51:16.418 --> 06:51:17.486

PERSONAL PRACTICES IT JUST

06:51:20.856 --> 06:51:22.724
SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME

06:51:22.791 --> 06:51:24.760
AND I IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

06:51:24.826 --> 06:51:26.294
WHY YOU TAKE IT AWAY FROM AN

06:51:26.361 --> 06:51:28.497
INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION AND

06:51:28.563 --> 06:51:31.500
PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE. THEY DO

06:51:31.566 --> 06:51:33.201
ALL THE HIRING AND THE FIRING.

06:51:33.268 --> 06:51:36.138
SEVEN NUMBER HOLD. I THINK THE

06:51:36.204 --> 06:51:37.839
GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

06:51:37.906 --> 06:51:39.674
IS OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSPARENCY

06:51:39.741 --> 06:51:43.445
AND FOR THERE TO BE- A PROCESS

06:51:43.512 --> 06:51:45.881
IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR THE KIND

06:51:45.947 --> 06:51:48.350
OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE- THOSE

06:51:48.417 --> 06:51:50.519
WHO ARE SEEKING TO HAVE THEIR

06:51:50.585 --> 06:51:52.454
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROMOTION

06:51:52.521 --> 06:51:54.289
EVALUATED CAN BE EVALUATED IN A

06:51:54.356 --> 06:51:56.825
WAY THAT THERE WAS CLARITY AND

06:51:56.892 --> 06:51:58.693
TRANSPARENCY TO THE TO THE

06:51:58.760 --> 06:51:59.394
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WAS

06:51:59.461 --> 06:52:01.096
ESSENTIALLY THE- THE THINKING

06:52:01.163 --> 06:52:05.033
BEHIND. OKAY THE PROBE. SO MY

06:52:05.100 --> 06:52:06.001
AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

06:52:06.068 --> 06:52:07.536

06:52:07.602 --> 06:52:10.372

OF SENSE I SEE WHERE YOU'RE

06:52:11.339 --> 06:52:13.208
TRYING TO GO WITH IT BUT SBB

ENTITY TO DO AUDITS AND

06:52:17.579 --> 06:52:18.980
INVESTIGATION OF PERSONNEL

06:52:19.047 --> 06:52:20.282
PRACTICES SO IT JUST DOESN'T

06:52:20.348 --> 06:52:21.616
MAKE SENSE TO ME JUST TO SEND

06:52:21.683 --> 06:52:24.019
THAT OVER TO KELLY CHAR- WHEN

06:52:24.086 --> 06:52:26.588
THIS IS REALLY A- A BODY THAT

06:52:26.655 --> 06:52:28.824
WAS SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO LOOK

06:52:28.890 --> 06:52:31.026

INFORMATION THAT WE DROVE ON TO

06:52:48.276 --> 06:52:49.878
REACH THAT CONCLUSION BECAUSE I

06:52:49.945 --> 06:52:52.547
THINK IT WAS AFTER HAVING-

06:52:52.614 --> 06:52:53.882
REVIEWED THE CALLOUS OUR

06:52:53.949 --> 06:52:57.219

THIS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I

06:53:12.100 --> 06:53:13.902
THINK THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME

06:53:13.969 --> 06:53:16.571
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT I'M LEAVING

AROUND THAT IF WE HAVE FEDERAL

07:37:50.776 --> 07:37:52.077

WAITING TIME IS THAT THE THRUST

07:38:20.072 --> 07:38:23.709
OF WHY YOU'RE PROPOSING THIS

07:38:23.776 --> 07:38:25.110

BEGINNING. OF THE DAY BEGINNING

07:38:28.714 --> 07:38:31.417
IN A SHIFT TOWARD THE END OF

07:38:31.483 --> 07:38:33.819
THE SHIFT. THE CENTER THE

STARTS WHEN THEIR EMPLOYER

07:38:56.075 --> 07:38:57.176

07:58:51.736 --> 07:58:54.238
CALIFORNIA FOR SURE SO I HAVE

07:58:54.305 --> 07:58:55.773
ONE QUESTION AND ONE CONCERN

07:58:55.840 --> 07:59:00.011
THAT MAYBE YOU COULD DRESS- WHY

07:59:00.078 --> 07:59:01.712
THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND-

07:59:01.779 --> 07:59:03.314
NUMBER- WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT

07:59:03.381 --> 07:59:05.716
ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THEN

07:59:05.783 --> 07:59:06.818
NUMBER TWO I NOTICED THAT YOU

07:59:06.884 --> 07:59:09.020
TOOK. AMENDMENTS AT SOME POINT

07:59:09.087 --> 07:59:12.290
IN TIME THAT REMOVED- THE

07:59:12.356 --> 07:59:14.792
STATE. LEGISLATURE AND THE

07:59:14.859 --> 07:59:17.662
STATE AGENCIES FROM THE SAME

07:59:17.728 --> 07:59:20.865
REQUIREMENT- WHY EXEMPT WHAT

07:59:20.932 --> 07:59:22.266
RIGHT WHY REQUIRE THIS ON

07:59:22.333 --> 07:59:24.168
LOCALITIES BUT NOT THE STATE

07:59:24.235 --> 07:59:25.970
PLAN I THINK THE ARGUMENT CAN

07:59:26.037 --> 07:59:27.905
BE MADE. SACRAMENTO AND

07:59:27.972 --> 07:59:29.540
WHEREVER THE STATE AGENCIES

07:59:29.607 --> 07:59:30.475
MEET IS ACTUALLY HARDER TO GET

07:59:30.541 --> 07:59:32.844
TO. THEN THE LOCALITIES THAT

07:59:32.910 --> 07:59:35.413
WERE REQUIRING- THESE EFFORTS

07:59:35.480 --> 07:59:38.216
ON. THANK YOU SIR JOHN'S I

07:59:38.282 --> 07:59:39.350
THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY GREAT

07:59:39.417 --> 07:59:41.052
QUESTION WHEN I BEGAN THE BILL

07:59:41.119 --> 07:59:42.653
IT DID APPLY TO ALMOST EVERY

07:59:42.720 --> 07:59:45.590
AGENCY AND BODY INCLUDING US IN

07:59:45.656 --> 07:59:47.525
THE STATE LEGISLATURE- BUT-

07:59:47.592 --> 07:59:49.026
GOING TO IT IS A PROCESS I

07:59:49.093 --> 07:59:49.894
CERTAINLY HAD TO TAKE

07:59:49.961 --> 07:59:50.962
AMENDMENTS THAT I DID NOT

07:59:51.028 --> 07:59:52.497
ENVISION TAKING. WHEN WE

07:59:52.563 --> 07:59:55.333
ARRIVED AT THIS THRESHOLD FOR

07:59:55.399 --> 07:59:57.635
LARGE COUNTIES IN LARGE CITIES-

07:59:57.702 --> 07:59:58.970
NOT IDEAL BUT I DO AGREE WITH

07:59:59.036 --> 07:59:59.937
YOU I THINK IT SHOULD BE

08:00:00.004 --> 08:00:00.872
APPLICABLE IN FACT ACTUALLY

08:00:00.938 --> 08:00:02.273
ADMINISTRATION HAS A TRAILER

08:00:02.340 --> 08:00:03.608
BILL LANGUAGEOUT THERE FOR

08:00:03.674 --> 08:00:05.343
STATE AGENCIES RIGHT NOW. I

08:00:05.409 --> 08:00:06.310
DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OUR

08:00:06.377 --> 08:00:07.612
HOUSES WILL CONCUR WITH THAT

08:00:07.678 --> 08:00:08.513
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

08:00:08.579 --> 08:00:10.081
SOMETHING I'M INTERESTED IN AND

08:00:10.148 --> 08:00:11.516
BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS A SUNSET

08:00:11.582 --> 08:00:13.684
IN TWENTY EIGHT DECEMBER OF

08:00:13.751 --> 08:00:14.285
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS IS AN

08:00:14.352 --> 08:00:15.052
ISSUE WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING

08:00:15.119 --> 08:00:19.590
ON. SHOULD THE GOVERNOR SIGNED-IT BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT

08:00:19.657 --> 08:00:20.057
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AS

08:00:20.124 --> 08:00:22.560
EXPENSIVE AS POSSIBLE. YOU'RE

08:00:22.627 --> 08:00:24.495
IN YOUR INITIAL. A PROPOSAL

08:00:24.562 --> 08:00:25.429
WHEN YOU STARTED THE BILL WHAT

08:00:25.496 --> 08:00:27.465
IT DIDN'T HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED

08:00:27.532 --> 08:00:29.300
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT. OF

08:00:29.367 --> 08:00:30.201
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. I

08:00:30.268 --> 08:00:32.103
GOT TO READ DOES NOT. TURN

08:00:32.170 --> 08:00:33.771
FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IT DIDN'T

08:00:33.838 --> 08:00:35.840
HAVE THAT LIMIT. OKAY THANK YOU.

08:00:35.907 --> 08:00:36.440
THANK YOU SIR JOHNSON A COUPLE

08:00:36.507 --> 08:00:39.911
EURO. MISTER CHAIR- I THINK

08:00:39.977 --> 08:00:41.379
MIKE MY QUESTION HAS TO DO

08:00:41.445 --> 08:00:43.581
WITH- WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE

08:00:43.648 --> 08:00:44.982
OF A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM IS

08:00:45.049 --> 08:00:49.487
IT THAT. THE THE BOARD OR THE

08:00:49.554 --> 08:00:51.956
COUNCIL HAS TO IMMEDIATELY

08:00:52.023 --> 08:00:54.859
CEASE THE MEETING AND- AND

08:00:54.926 --> 08:00:58.496
RESCHEDULE IT. I HEARD OF THAT

08:00:58.563 --> 08:01:00.064
CONCERN VIA THE OPPOSITION BUT

08:01:00.131 --> 08:01:01.566
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT CONCERN

08:01:01.632 --> 08:01:03.134
I MEAN IT'S THE SAME CASE IF

08:01:03.201 --> 08:01:04.435
YOU'RE HAVING A PUBLIC MEETING

08:01:04.502 --> 08:01:06.003
IN THE ALL THE POWER WENT OFF.

08:01:06.070 --> 08:01:06.871
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

08:01:06.938 --> 08:01:07.939
CONSTITUTES A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN

08:01:08.005 --> 08:01:09.507
OF THE MEETING I DON'T KNOW IF

08:01:09.574 --> 08:01:10.942
MY WITNESS FROM THE FIRST OF A

08:01:11.008 --> 08:01:12.843
COLLISION WITH THE COMMENT ON

08:01:12.910 --> 08:01:15.780
THAT BUT I DON'T. READ A SUCH.

08:01:15.846 --> 08:01:17.315
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT. WELL

08:01:17.381 --> 08:01:20.151
I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO

08:01:20.218 --> 08:01:22.787
LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR- EX. EXPERT

08:01:22.853 --> 08:01:25.556
HAS TO SAY BUT- THE BROWN ACT

08:01:25.623 --> 08:01:29.093
REQUIRES. ACCESS AND IF YOU IF

08:01:29.160 --> 08:01:30.728
FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE A

08:01:30.795 --> 08:01:32.396
FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM YOU HAVE

08:01:32.463 --> 08:01:35.132
SOMEBODY THAT DISRUPTS- A GROUP

08:01:35.199 --> 08:01:36.167
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO

08:01:36.234 --> 08:01:38.102
CALL IN AND TOTALLY DISRUPT THE

08:01:38.169 --> 08:01:39.637
MEETING I MEAN I WHAT WHAT

08:01:39.704 --> 08:01:42.006
HAPPENED IN OUR CITY IS WHEN

08:01:42.073 --> 08:01:43.541
PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND THEY

08:01:43.608 --> 08:01:44.675
DISRUPTED THE MEETING. WE

08:01:44.742 --> 08:01:46.677
RECESS UNTIL WE CAN GET CONTROL

08:01:46.744 --> 08:01:48.579
OF THE MEETING BACK AGAIN AND

08:01:48.646 --> 08:01:50.715
IF WE COULDN'T CONTINUE BECAUSE

08:01:50.781 --> 08:01:51.349
THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF A

08:01:51.415 --> 08:01:52.984
DISRUPTION WE HAD TO. CANCEL

08:01:53.050 --> 08:01:54.452
THE REST OF THE MEETING AND

08:01:54.518 --> 08:01:56.120
LEAVE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT

08:01:56.187 --> 08:01:58.656
THANKFULLY BUT I AM. I LIKE TO

08:01:58.723 --> 08:02:00.725
BUILD. THE CONCERN I HAVE IS

08:02:00.791 --> 08:02:03.694
THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE A

08:02:03.761 --> 08:02:04.495
NUMBER OF WAYS THAT A SYSTEM

08:02:04.562 --> 08:02:07.431
CAN FAIL. AND IF IT MEANS THAT

08:02:07.498 --> 08:02:09.267
THE MEETING HAS TO BE CANCELED

08:02:09.333 --> 08:02:11.369
THEN YOU END UP WITH TIMELINE

08:02:11.435 --> 08:02:13.004
CONSTRAINTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO

08:02:13.070 --> 08:02:15.373
DO THINGS BY A CERTAIN DATE

08:02:15.439 --> 08:02:16.440
LIKE PASS A BUDGET BY A CERTAIN

08:02:16.507 --> 08:02:19.677
DATE- POOR FINISH- IF YOU'RE

08:02:19.744 --> 08:02:21.345
DOING BOND WORK THERE'S USUALLY

08:02:21.412 --> 08:02:22.546
DEADLINES THAT ARE INVOLVED

08:02:22.613 --> 08:02:24.548
WITH THAT. THEY'RE JUST A LOT

08:02:24.615 --> 08:02:26.751
OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT COULD

08:02:26.817 --> 08:02:28.786
ARISE AND FOR US TO TELL LOCAL

08:02:28.853 --> 08:02:33.457
GOVERNMENT. AND FRANKLY I DON'T

08:02:33.524 --> 08:02:34.358
HAVE VERY MANY I HAVE NO CITIES.

08:02:34.425 --> 08:02:36.127
BUT A COUPLE OF COUNTIES IF

08:02:36.193 --> 08:02:39.730
THIS WOULD APPLY TO- THAT. SO

08:02:39.797 --> 08:02:40.865
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT IT

08:02:40.931 --> 08:02:42.800
DOESN'T APPLY IN MY AREA BUT I

08:02:42.867 --> 08:02:44.568
AM CONCERNED WITH THAT WITH THE

08:02:44.635 --> 08:02:46.837
CONSTRAINTS. THAT DISAPPEARS TO

08:02:46.904 --> 08:02:48.806
PUT. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

08:02:48.873 --> 08:02:50.274
PARTICIPATION AND IT'S FOR THE

08:02:50.341 --> 08:02:52.710
NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AND

08:02:52.777 --> 08:02:53.611
TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE THROUGH

08:02:53.678 --> 08:02:56.247
WITH COVERT- I JUST WORRY ABOUT

08:02:56.314 --> 08:02:57.982
THAT TIMELINE AND I WORRY

08:02:58.049 --> 08:03:02.153
ABOUT. BURDENING IS THAT IT AND

08:03:02.219 --> 08:03:04.588
NOT HAVING A AN ESCAPE HATCH.

08:03:04.655 --> 08:03:06.424
OR IF YOUR LINE GOES AND I AND

08:03:06.490 --> 08:03:08.826
I AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

08:03:08.893 --> 08:03:10.294
IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. THIS

08:03:10.361 --> 08:03:12.763
ACCESS IS ILLUSORY. BECAUSE I

08:03:12.830 --> 08:03:14.699
HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO MOVE

08:03:14.765 --> 08:03:17.802
GO OVER TO A PARK. OR A LIBRARY

08:03:17.868 --> 08:03:18.669
IN ORDER TO GET INTERNET

08:03:18.736 --> 08:03:22.406
ACCESS. AND SO IT'S IT MAY WORK

08:03:22.473 --> 08:03:24.408
IN- BRILL URBANIZED CENTERS BUT

08:03:24.475 --> 08:03:26.344
IT IT DOESN'T WORK QUITE AS

08:03:26.410 --> 08:03:28.346
WELL IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE

08:03:28.412 --> 08:03:30.548
INTERNET ACCESS IS. IS NOT

08:03:30.614 --> 08:03:33.551
AVAILABLE SO I AM CONCERNED

08:03:33.617 --> 08:03:37.121
WITH THE- END RESULT AND

08:03:37.188 --> 08:03:38.289
BECAUSE OF THAT I PROBABLY

08:03:38.356 --> 08:03:39.223
WON'T END UP SUPPORTING IT

08:03:39.290 --> 08:03:41.292
TODAY. UNLESS I GET AN

08:03:41.359 --> 08:03:42.626
ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE AN

08:03:42.693 --> 08:03:44.328
ESCAPE HATCH FOR THOSE

08:03:44.395 --> 08:03:46.330
COMMUNITIES THAT- BUT FOR SOME

08:03:46.397 --> 08:03:48.366
REASON LOSE ACCESS TO THEIR

08:03:48.432 --> 08:03:49.900
INTERNET THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE

08:03:49.967 --> 08:03:51.435
WITH THEIR MEETING AND- AND

08:03:51.502 --> 08:03:52.336
TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO

08:03:52.403 --> 08:03:54.105
HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE

08:03:54.171 --> 08:03:54.572
COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO

08:03:54.638 --> 08:03:56.574
PARTICIPATE. THE SENATE CAREER

08:03:56.640 --> 08:03:58.109
I THINK YOU BRING UP THREE GOOD

08:03:58.175 --> 08:04:00.211
POINTS- THE FIRST I'LL JUST SAY

08:04:00.277 --> 08:04:01.579
ABOUT THE DISRUPTION IS YOU

08:04:01.645 --> 08:04:02.313
KNOW I THINK BECAUSE WE'VE

08:04:02.380 --> 08:04:03.681
EXPERIENCED HERE IT'S MUCH

08:04:03.748 --> 08:04:05.282
EASIER TO CONTROL MAYBE A

08:04:05.349 --> 08:04:06.951
HUNDRED ROWDY GUESTS-

08:04:07.017 --> 08:04:08.652
VIRTUALLY. THAT A HUNDRED ROWDY

08:04:08.719 --> 08:04:10.955
GUESTS IN YOUR CHAMBER SURFACE

08:04:11.021 --> 08:04:13.090
GIVEN DOWN TO THE OPTION OF.

08:04:13.157 --> 08:04:15.459
ONE OR THE OTHER I THINK WE

08:04:15.526 --> 08:04:16.994
BUSINESS'S SAKE CHOOSE TO HAVE

08:04:17.061 --> 08:04:18.596
A VIRTUAL OPTION. AND IT'S

08:04:18.662 --> 08:04:20.297
AGAIN REMEMBER IS HAVING

08:04:20.364 --> 08:04:21.365
ADDITIONAL THE OPTION OF

08:04:21.432 --> 08:04:23.801
TELEPHONIC. OR VIRTUAL SO

08:04:23.868 --> 08:04:24.935
PEOPLE IN RURAL COUNTIES WHICH

08:04:25.002 --> 08:04:26.070
OF COURSE WE HAVE A REAL

08:04:26.137 --> 08:04:27.171
DIGITAL VIBE WHICH IS A REAL

08:04:27.238 --> 08:04:29.573
PROBLEM- STILL PEOPLE HAVE THE

08:04:29.640 --> 08:04:31.942
OPTION TO CALL IN OR- ZOOM IN

08:04:32.009 --> 08:04:33.043
OR WHATEVER ONLINE PLATFORM

08:04:33.110 --> 08:04:35.012
JURISDICTION CHOOSES TO DO SO.

08:04:35.079 --> 08:04:37.348
SO I'M HOPING THAT RATHER THAN

08:04:37.415 --> 08:04:38.549
HAVING TO DRIVE TO YOUR SKIN

08:04:38.616 --> 08:04:40.518
YOU SEE. IN A RURAL DISTRICT

08:04:40.584 --> 08:04:41.685
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SAY DRIVE

08:04:41.752 --> 08:04:43.020
TO PARK OR GET ON THE PHONE AND

08:04:43.087 --> 08:04:44.688
CALL IN A PRESCRIPTION. FOR

08:04:44.755 --> 08:04:45.990
YOUR FIVE MINUTES OF PUBLIC

08:04:46.056 --> 08:04:48.726
TESTIMONY PROBABLY MORE. MORE

08:04:48.793 --> 08:04:50.027
EFFICIENT AND THEN I WOULD SAY

08:04:50.094 --> 08:04:51.328
THE THIRD THING TO THAT POINT

08:04:51.395 --> 08:04:53.364
IS. TO MY KNOWLEDGE DURING THE

08:04:53.431 --> 08:04:54.999
YEAR PLUS THEM ENDEMIC I DON'T

08:04:55.065 --> 08:04:56.867
KNOW OF ANY JURISDICTION WHICH-

08:04:56.934 --> 08:04:58.369
AND KEEP IN MIND. YOU NEVER IT

08:04:58.436 --> 08:05:00.604
HAS UNIVERSAL EXISTED BEYOND OR

08:05:00.671 --> 08:05:01.539
SIX JUST TO UNDER FIFTY

08:05:01.605 --> 08:05:03.174
THOUSAND. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY

08:05:03.240 --> 08:05:04.942
FAILURES AND OUTAGES THAT EVER

08:05:05.009 --> 08:05:07.645
EXISTED. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT

08:05:07.711 --> 08:05:08.879
IN THE CASE OF THIS JUST BEING

08:05:08.946 --> 08:05:10.247
EDITION WITH THAT ALSO EXISTS

08:05:10.314 --> 08:05:12.082
SO I. I GENERALLY DON'T KNOW IF

08:05:12.149 --> 08:05:13.217
THAT HAS ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM

08:05:13.284 --> 08:05:14.084
BUT I'VE NOT HEARD OF THIS IS

08:05:14.151 --> 08:05:15.920
AN ISSUE. AND I WOULD AM

08:05:15.986 --> 08:05:17.321
ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW WITH A

08:05:17.388 --> 08:05:19.056
MODERN TECHNOLOGY MODERN. POWER

08:05:19.123 --> 08:05:20.491
GRIDTHAT I THINK WE WOULD BE

08:05:20.558 --> 08:05:21.826
PRETTY DURABLE WITH OUR-

08:05:21.892 --> 08:05:23.727
TELEPHONIC AND DIGITAL SYSTEM

08:05:23.794 --> 08:05:25.429
SO I'M I'M SAYING THAT. I JUST

08:05:25.496 --> 08:05:26.630
DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY IN

08:05:26.697 --> 08:05:28.165
REALITY IT'S GOING TO BE AS

08:05:28.232 --> 08:05:30.334
DESTRUCTIVE AS IT IS- YEAH. BUT

08:05:30.401 --> 08:05:31.669
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION

08:05:31.735 --> 08:05:33.304
FOR RURAL AND URBAN COUNTIES

08:05:33.370 --> 08:05:37.475
LIKE TO HAVE MORE MORE. OPTIONS

08:05:37.541 --> 08:05:38.042
ULTIMATELY. YOU CAN. PLEASE

08:05:38.108 --> 08:05:38.676
CHAIRMAN I MIGHT. ALL RIGHT MY

08:05:38.742 --> 08:05:39.944
BIGGEST ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH

08:05:40.010 --> 08:05:41.278
WHETHER YOU PUT THIS IN THE

08:05:41.345 --> 08:05:43.614
BROWN ACT. SUCH THAT IT IS

08:05:43.681 --> 08:05:45.082
REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED BY

08:05:45.149 --> 08:05:47.418
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND AS A

08:05:47.485 --> 08:05:49.353
CONDITION OF THE BROWN ACT THAT

08:05:49.420 --> 08:05:51.355
IF. THERE'S ANY PROBLEM WITH

08:05:51.422 --> 08:05:53.991
THE SERVICE. THAT THEY HAVE TO

08:05:54.058 --> 08:05:54.825
TERMINATE THE MEETING THAT'S MY

08:05:54.892 --> 08:05:56.594
ISSUE. ON WHETHER YOU AGREE

08:05:56.660 --> 08:05:58.629
WITH WHETHER IT'S- A- PHONE

08:05:58.696 --> 08:06:01.131
LINES AND- INTERNET IS. IS

08:06:01.198 --> 08:06:03.200
FAULTY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. I

08:06:03.267 --> 08:06:04.602
MEAN I DID COME OUT AND I'LL

08:06:04.668 --> 08:06:06.737
SHOW YOU HOW IT'S FAULTY BUT-

08:06:06.804 --> 08:06:08.305
BUT THE REAL ISSUE HAS TO DO

08:06:08.372 --> 08:06:09.673
WITH. THE BROWN ACT

08:06:09.740 --> 08:06:11.375
REQUIREMENTS REQUIRE CERTAIN

08:06:11.442 --> 08:06:12.710
THINGS AND IF THIS IS IN THE

08:06:12.776 --> 08:06:16.080
BROWN ACT AND MY READING OF IT.

08:06:16.146 --> 08:06:17.581
IS SUCH THAT YOU'D HAVE TO STOP.

08:06:17.648 --> 08:06:18.482
YOUR MEETING IF YOU HAVE A

08:06:18.549 --> 08:06:19.750
FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM AND IF

08:06:19.817 --> 08:06:21.285
I'M WRONG THAT'S THE QUESTION

08:06:21.352 --> 08:06:23.654
IS AM I WRONG. IF IT NOBODY CAN

08:06:23.721 --> 08:06:25.756
TELL ME THEN I'M NOT GING TO

08:06:25.823 --> 08:06:27.057
SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

08:06:27.124 --> 08:06:28.125
TO PUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT

08:06:28.192 --> 08:06:30.160
POSITION SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

08:06:30.227 --> 08:06:30.728
ONE ISSUE THAT I'M CONCERNED

08:06:30.794 --> 08:06:34.298
ABOUT. SORRY THANK YOU- SEVERAL

08:06:34.365 --> 08:06:36.133

SINISTER. THANK YOU MR- THANK

08:06:53.417 --> 08:06:54.485
YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS

08:06:54.552 --> 08:06:57.588
FORWARD I YOU KNOW I THINK

08:06:57.655 --> 08:06:58.856
THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE

08:06:58.923 --> 08:07:01.625
ACTUALLY FOUND INCREASED

08:07:01.692 --> 08:07:02.192
PARTICIPATION IN SOMEONE IN

08:07:02.259 --> 08:07:05.396
GOVERNMENT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR

08:07:05.462 --> 08:07:08.165
RURAL- CONSTITUENTS FOR FOLKS

08:07:08.232 --> 08:07:10.067
FROM SAY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

08:07:10.134 --> 08:07:13.704
WHO CAN'T GET UP TO SACRAMENTO.

08:07:13.771 --> 08:07:15.039
MMHM EITHER BECAUSE OF A

08:07:15.105 --> 08:07:17.174
PANDEMIC OR FRANKLY BECAUSE OF

08:07:17.241 --> 08:07:19.376
MANY FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

08:07:19.443 --> 08:07:20.611
THIS PLACE IS INHERENTLY

08:07:20.678 --> 08:07:22.413
LIMITING TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T

08:07:22.479 --> 08:07:24.281
HAVE THE MEANS EITHER TO HIRE A

08:07:24.348 --> 08:07:26.050
LOBBYIST OR TAKE A SOUTHWEST

08:07:26.116 --> 08:07:28.485
FLIGHT UP TO SACRAMENTO- I'M

08:07:28.552 --> 08:07:30.821
DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE

08:07:30.888 --> 08:07:31.522
ORIGINAL VERSION OF YOUR

08:07:31.589 --> 08:07:34.258
LEGISLATION- THAT THE STATE

08:07:34.325 --> 08:07:36.360
LEGISLATURE FIX OFF IT TO

08:07:36.427 --> 08:07:39.196
EXEMPT ITSELF. FROM THIS BILL

08:07:39.263 --> 08:07:40.531
AND I THINK I HOPE IT'S NOT A

08:07:40.598 --> 08:07:42.232
FATAL FLAW ON THIS BILL BECAUSE

08:07:42.299 --> 08:07:44.168
I WANT TO SEE THIS BECOME LAW

08:07:44.234 --> 08:07:46.170
BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT

08:07:46.236 --> 08:07:47.871
REFLECTS VERY WELL ON ON THIS

08:07:47.938 --> 08:07:51.241
BODY- AND I'M I'M I'M PLEASED

08:07:51.308 --> 08:07:52.376
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE

08:07:52.443 --> 08:07:55.946
THIS HEARING RIGHT NOW- IN

08:07:56.013 --> 08:07:58.983
ALLOWING REMOTE PARTICIPATION-

08:07:59.049 --> 08:08:00.918
NOT FROM MEMBERS BUT CERTAINLY

08:08:00.985 --> 08:08:02.519
FROM THE PUBLIC. I THINK IT'S

08:08:02.586 --> 08:08:04.655
ENABLED THE GREATER EXPANSION

08:08:04.722 --> 08:08:06.624
OF DEMOCRACY AND I HOPE THAT

08:08:06.690 --> 08:08:08.392
CONTINUES BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S AT

08:08:08.459 --> 08:08:09.093
THE DISCRETION OF OUR

08:08:09.159 --> 08:08:10.828
LEADERSHIP I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

08:08:10.894 --> 08:08:12.630
THE IN LAW SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

08:08:12.696 --> 08:08:14.898
HAVING ISSUES RETAINING THE

08:08:14.965 --> 08:08:17.067
STATE LEGISLATURE'S. ROLE IN

08:08:17.134 --> 08:08:19.236
THIS- AND SO YOU'RE LIMITED NOT

08:08:19.303 --> 08:08:21.005
JUST A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT TO

08:08:21.071 --> 08:08:23.941
LARGER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- SO

08:08:24.008 --> 08:08:26.043
ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT.

08:08:26.110 --> 08:08:26.944
YOU KNOW THE SMALLER

08:08:27.011 --> 08:08:28.812
GOVERNMENTS THE SMALLER CITIES

08:08:28.879 --> 08:08:30.214
THE SMALLER COUNTIES THOSE THE

08:08:30.280 --> 08:08:31.682
PLACES THAT IT'S EVEN HARDER TO

08:08:31.749 --> 08:08:33.550
PARTICIPATE SOMETIMES THOSE

08:08:33.617 --> 08:08:36.120
ALSO DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT

08:08:36.186 --> 08:08:37.855
THAT TWENTY FIFTY THOUSAND

08:08:37.921 --> 08:08:40.224
PERSON LIMITATION WAS ADDED

08:08:40.290 --> 08:08:41.025
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY

08:08:41.091 --> 08:08:43.093
GONNA HURT- THOSE WITHOUT

08:08:43.160 --> 08:08:46.096
ACCESS- I HOPE GOING FORWARD

08:08:46.163 --> 08:08:47.598
YOU'LL FIND SOME OPPORTUNITY OR

08:08:47.665 --> 08:08:49.033
MAYBE THIS BODY WILL FIND

08:08:49.099 --> 08:08:50.300
OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN THIS

08:08:50.367 --> 08:08:51.969
MEASURE. I THINK SENATOR JONES

08:08:52.036 --> 08:08:52.870
BROUGHT UP VERY IMPORTANT

08:08:52.936 --> 08:08:54.471
POINTS AND I THINK THERE'S IT'S

08:08:54.538 --> 08:08:54.972
ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT

08:08:55.039 --> 08:08:57.074
OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR SOME BI

08:08:57.141 --> 08:09:01.345
PARTISAN- AGREEMENT- I'D ALSO

08:09:01.412 --> 08:09:04.248
LIKE TO SEE. THE ELEMENTS OF

08:09:04.314 --> 08:09:09.053
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT ALLOW

08:09:09.119 --> 08:09:10.120
FOR MEMBER PARTICIPATION- FROM

08:09:10.187 --> 08:09:13.590
IN IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES- TO

08:09:13.657 --> 08:09:17.127
PERMIT IT TO PERSIST. BECAUSE I

08:09:17.194 --> 08:09:18.562
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I CREATE

08:09:18.629 --> 08:09:20.230
WE DON'T LOSE ANYTHING WHEN I

08:09:20.297 --> 08:09:22.733
WAS. QUARANTINING AT HOME

08:09:22.800 --> 08:09:23.734
DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN

08:09:23.801 --> 08:09:25.703
PARTICIPATING THESE PROCEEDINGS

08:09:25.769 --> 08:09:29.139
FROM ZOOM- I HAD EVERY BIT AS

08:09:29.206 --> 08:09:30.074
MUCH STANDING AS ANY OTHER

08:09:30.140 --> 08:09:33.644
MEMBER. AND I THINK THAT THE

08:09:33.711 --> 08:09:34.845
TECHNICAL ISSUES CAN BE SOLVED

08:09:34.912 --> 08:09:36.480
HERE SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL

08:09:36.547 --> 08:09:39.083
CONSIDER BOTH SUBJECTING THE

08:09:39.149 --> 08:09:40.784
MEMBERS THEMSELVES OF THESE

08:09:40.851 --> 08:09:42.486
BODIES NOT JUST THE PUBLIC TO

08:09:42.553 --> 08:09:44.188
THIS TO THIS BILL. I HOPE

08:09:44.254 --> 08:09:45.856
YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE

08:09:45.923 --> 08:09:48.826
STATE LEGISLATURE AND WHATEVER

08:09:48.892 --> 08:09:51.095
WHOEVER IS EXEMPTED US HOPE

08:09:51.161 --> 08:09:52.963
THEY RECONSIDER THAT PROVISION.

08:09:53.030 --> 08:09:54.898
AND I HAVE TO SAY LASTLY VERY

08:09:54.965 --> 08:09:57.134
DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THE URBAN

08:09:57.201 --> 08:09:58.235

08:09:58.302 --> 08:10:00.871
OPPOSITION I ASSUME THAT MEANS

ANGELES. AND WE'RE

08:10:10.614 --> 08:10:12.716
TECHNOLOGICALLY CAPABLE PLACE-

08:10:12.783 --> 08:10:14.718
THAT YOU CAN CALL ON THE PHONE

OR YOU CAN ZOOM IN THERE'S ALL

08:10:16.553 --> 08:10:18.989
KINDS OF OPTIONSBUT- THAT

08:10:19.056 --> 08:10:21.558
RESISTANCE TO ME IS- ALLIES ARE

08:10:21.625 --> 08:10:24.461

SORT OF YOU'RE UP AGAINST

08:10:33.470 --> 08:10:34.338
FORCES BIGGER THAN YOURSELF BUT

08:10:34.404 --> 08:10:36.740
I HOPE THAT- WE ALL KIND OF

08:10:36.807 --> 08:10:38.876

SEE MYSELF STREAMING LIVE ON A

08:10:45.783 --> 08:10:47.885
SCREEN BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT

08:10:47.951 --> 08:10:50.120
SCARY ABOUT STREAMING PUBLIC

08:10:50.187 --> 08:10:52.055
SEARCH PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS LIKE

08:10:52.122 --> 08:10:53.323
THIS AND- THIS IS FRANKLY THE

08:10:53.390 --> 08:10:57.394
FUTURE. SO. ALTHOUGH I'VE MOVED

08:10:57.461 --> 08:10:57.961
THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE

08:10:58.028 --> 08:11:01.465
TIME. ALL RIGHTY- OTHER

08:11:01.532 --> 08:11:03.333
COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES THERE

WERE KELSEY. LISTEN TO MY

08:11:06.737 --> 08:11:08.372
COLLEAGUES WERE STUCK WITH THE

08:11:08.438 --> 08:11:10.307
FACT THAT THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL

08:11:10.374 --> 08:11:13.110
GOVERNMENT PUT A 210050% CAP ON

08:11:13.177 --> 08:11:15.679
IT BECAUSE OF I GUESS POTENTIAL

08:11:15.746 --> 08:11:17.548
FINANCIAL BURDEN SOME OF THIS

08:11:17.614 --> 08:11:18.682
MANDATE OULD HAVE A SMALLER

08:11:18.749 --> 08:11:20.083
COMMUNITIES BUT WE HAVE A TWO

08:11:20.150 --> 08:11:23.086
YEAR SON SAID IN THAT ALLOWS US

08:11:23.153 --> 08:11:25.122
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THIS

08:11:25.189 --> 08:11:27.191
POPULATION FLOOR. AND ALSO THE

08:11:27.257 --> 08:11:29.526
BILLS OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND

08:11:29.593 --> 08:11:30.227
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE INFORMATION

08:11:30.294 --> 08:11:35.199
HOW PEOPLE. WILL DO IT WILL

08:11:35.265 --> 08:11:37.034
PARTICIPATE HOW. THIS IS THE

08:11:37.100 --> 08:11:39.002
AUTHOR OF ANY IDEA OF HOW WE

08:11:39.069 --> 08:11:40.470
WILL ASSESS THE POPULATION

08:11:40.537 --> 08:11:43.106
FLOOR IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY HERE

08:11:43.173 --> 08:11:45.142
TO REMOTE HEARINGS GOING ON IN

08:11:45.209 --> 08:11:47.044
THESE SALLER COMMUNITIES LESS

08:11:47.110 --> 08:11:49.746
THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. HAVE

08:11:49.813 --> 08:11:50.347
THERE WERE SOMETHING THAT THE

08:11:50.414 --> 08:11:52.382
ASSEMBLY. WHEN THEY PUT THE

08:11:52.449 --> 08:11:53.951
AMENDMENT ON YOU THAT'S AN

08:11:54.017 --> 08:11:56.687
EXCELLENT POINT SENATOR AND I

08:11:56.753 --> 08:11:58.922
VALUE I APPRECIATE THE POINT-

08:11:58.989 --> 08:12:00.057
YES YOU KNOW NOTHING IN THIS

08:12:00.123 --> 08:12:01.491
BILL OR EVEN EXISTING LAW NOW

08:12:01.558 --> 08:12:03.126
PRECLUDES JURISDICTIONS OF ANY

08:12:03.193 --> 08:12:05.796
SIZE OR TYPE FROM HAVING THE

08:12:05.863 --> 08:12:06.563
REMOTE OPTION I KNOW

08:12:06.630 --> 08:12:07.764
ANECDOTALLY EVEN FROM OUR

08:12:07.831 --> 08:12:08.832
DISTRICT THERE WILL BE SCHOOL

08:12:08.899 --> 08:12:10.000
DISTRICTS IN THE SMALL CITY

08:12:10.067 --> 08:12:11.501
THAT CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE.

08:12:11.568 --> 08:12:13.237
ONLINE OR VIRTUAL POSITIONS

08:12:13.303 --> 08:12:15.239
SOME FORM SO YES THE ACCESSING

08:12:15.305 --> 08:12:16.573
OF THE DATA WILL PROBABLY NOT

08:12:16.640 --> 08:12:17.975
BE A PERFECT COMPARISON BUT THE

08:12:18.041 --> 08:12:18.709
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION

08:12:18.775 --> 08:12:20.544
ACTUALLY DID A REPORT I THINK

08:12:20.611 --> 08:12:22.279
LAST WEEK. AND THEY ALSO DID

08:12:22.346 --> 08:12:23.447
TALK ABOUT HOW THE ECSTASY OF

08:12:23.513 --> 08:12:25.182
VIRTUAL MEETINGS ALSO EXPANDED

08:12:25.249 --> 08:12:26.516
ACCESS SO I THINK THERE WILL BE

08:12:26.583 --> 08:12:28.518
MORE DATA POINTS I THINK SO

08:12:28.585 --> 08:12:29.453
LONG AS THEY WERE STILL LIVING

08:12:29.519 --> 08:12:30.420
IN THIS CURRENT SAID EMERGENCE

08:12:30.487 --> 08:12:31.521
WE SEE IF WE STILL AT LEAST

08:12:31.588 --> 08:12:33.290
HAVE THAT DATA POINT WHERE.

08:12:33.357 --> 08:12:34.691
IT'S MORE UNIVERSAL VIRTUAL

08:12:34.758 --> 08:12:36.693
VIRTUAL POSITION. AND THEN

08:12:36.760 --> 08:12:39.329
THERE'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

08:12:39.396 --> 08:12:41.231
AN EMERGENCY MORE HAVE A COVERT

08:12:41.298 --> 08:12:43.400
HEALTH SITUATION AND THEN WHEN

08:12:43.467 --> 08:12:44.668
WE DON'T WE JUST GO ON AND WE

08:12:44.735 --> 08:12:46.737
DO THIS. AND I WHEN I WAS IN

08:12:46.803 --> 08:12:48.272
LOCAL GOVERNMENT I HAD SOME

08:12:48.338 --> 08:12:49.973
ISSUES WITH THE BROWN ACT

08:12:50.040 --> 08:12:52.476
PARTICULARLY WHEN. NOW I THINK

08:12:52.542 --> 08:12:54.478
WE'RE MORE SOPHISTICATED WHEN

08:12:54.544 --> 08:12:57.147
WE POST IF A MEMBER IS GOING TO

08:12:57.214 --> 08:12:59.082
PARTICIPATE TELECOMMUNICATION

08:12:59.149 --> 08:13:01.251
OR TELEPHONE NOT TELEPHONICALLY

08:13:01.318 --> 08:13:04.087
REMOTELY. WE NOTICE IT THE

08:13:04.154 --> 08:13:06.123
PERSON IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM HAS

08:13:06.189 --> 08:13:08.792
TO PUT A SIGN UP THAT SAYS I'M

08:13:08.859 --> 08:13:10.327
PARTICIPATING THIS LITTLE CITY

08:13:10.394 --> 08:13:12.729
COUNCIL MEETING AND THEN THE

08:13:12.796 --> 08:13:16.166
PUBLIC IS ABLE TO GO IN. TO

08:13:16.233 --> 08:13:18.201
YOUR ROOM SINCE IT'S NOW AN

08:13:18.268 --> 08:13:20.337
OFFICIAL AREA AND I'M WONDERING

08:13:20.404 --> 08:13:21.571
IF WE MAKE A DISTINCTION

08:13:21.638 --> 08:13:24.408
BETWEEN I MEAN. IF WE HAVE A

08:13:24.474 --> 08:13:29.413
HEALTH. PROBLEM OR HEALTH- I.

08:13:29.479 --> 08:13:32.516
WHY IN THE WORLD SOMEBODY COULD

08:13:32.582 --> 08:13:34.685
COME INTO MY HOUSE SO I GUESS

08:13:34.751 --> 08:13:36.386
IF I WAS PARTICIPATING I JUST

08:13:36.453 --> 08:13:37.621
WOULD ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT

08:13:37.688 --> 08:13:39.489
BECAUSE IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME

08:13:39.556 --> 08:13:41.258
IF THAT LITTLE WRINKLE

08:13:41.325 --> 08:13:42.759
CONTINUES AND IT WAS ONE OF

08:13:42.826 --> 08:13:43.827
THOSE THINGS AS WE GO INTO THE

08:13:43.894 --> 08:13:45.896
BROWN ACT HE THINKING AS WE'RE

08:13:45.963 --> 08:13:47.664
MORE SOPHISTICATED NOW THAT

08:13:47.731 --> 08:13:49.399
SEEMS STRANGE THAT WE WOULD

08:13:49.466 --> 08:13:52.202
STILL DO THAT IT'S NOT NINETEEN

08:13:52.269 --> 08:13:52.769
EIGHTY EIGHT ANYMORE SO I'LL

08:13:52.836 --> 08:13:53.737
JUST. LEAVE THAT AS A

08:13:53.804 --> 08:13:54.938
pRHETORICAL QUESTION FOR THE

08:13:55.005 --> 08:13:56.373
AUTHOR AND I'LL JUST SAY YOU

08:13:56.440 --> 08:13:57.741

AND SENATOR STARNES POINT I

08:13:58.909 --> 08:13:59.776
THINK THERE IS MUCH TO BE

08:13:59.843 --> 08:14:00.978
MODERNIZING THE BROWN ACT

08:14:01.044 --> 08:14:02.679
EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE GOVERNOR

08:14:02.746 --> 08:14:05.282
WAS MODERNIZATIONS DEPEND OF

08:14:05.349 --> 08:14:06.350
COURSE FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE

08:14:06.416 --> 08:14:08.919
OFFICIAL SIDE AND I INTEND TO

08:14:08.986 --> 08:14:09.853
KEEP WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL

08:14:09.920 --> 08:14:12.356
GOVERNMENT- CONSTITUENCIES TO

08:14:12.422 --> 08:14:14.891
KEEP MODERNIZING THAT HOPEFULLY

08:14:14.958 --> 08:14:15.525
WE WILL SEE SOME SORT OF CHANGE

08:14:15.592 --> 08:14:17.527
ON THAT FRONT. THE SORRY.

08:14:17.594 --> 08:14:19.096

THANK YOU CHAIR. THIS IS A

08:14:28.171 --> 08:14:29.840
GREAT CONVERSATION I'VE LEARNED

08:14:29.906 --> 08:14:31.775
A LOT FROM MY COLLEAGUES- IN

08:14:31.842 --> 08:14:35.412
THE COURSE OF- I WAS REVIEWING

08:14:35.479 --> 08:14:37.547
THIS MATTER HAVING SERVED IN. A

08:14:37.614 --> 08:14:40.450
CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS A-

08:14:40.517 --> 08:14:44.287
SUPERVISOR OREO CAPACITY- THE

08:14:44.354 --> 08:14:47.457
BROWN ACT IS A VERY REAL- SET

08:14:47.524 --> 08:14:51.261
OF OBLIGATIONS. AND NOT ONLY IS

08:14:51.328 --> 08:14:54.364
A VIOLATION. READ HAVOC IN

08:14:54.431 --> 08:14:57.100
CONSEQUENCE OF FOR THE BODY IT

08:14:57.167 --> 08:15:00.637
CAN ALSO UNDO ALL OF THE POLICY

08:15:00.704 --> 08:15:02.873
OR LEGISLATION OR DECISION

08:15:02.939 --> 08:15:04.574
MAKING THAT WAS DONE BY THAT

08:15:04.641 --> 08:15:06.877
BOARD THE CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY

08:15:06.943 --> 08:15:09.312
SIGNIFICANT IN EXPECTATION

08:15:09.379 --> 08:15:11.715
OBLIGATIONS ARE VERY REAL- I

08:15:11.782 --> 08:15:13.483
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I

08:15:13.550 --> 08:15:16.053
THINK. WE SHOULD HAVE THIS

08:15:16.119 --> 08:15:17.821
ATTACHED TO THE STATE

08:15:17.888 --> 08:15:20.891
LEGISLATURE IN TWO BOARDS AND

08:15:20.957 --> 08:15:22.726
COMMISSIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO

08:15:22.793 --> 08:15:24.461
DO IT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SIZE

08:15:24.528 --> 08:15:26.630
OF THE CITY. NOW WE'RE TALKING

08:15:26.696 --> 08:15:29.933
ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL. ISSUES

08:15:30.000 --> 08:15:32.402
TECH ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA

08:15:32.469 --> 08:15:34.504
SHOULD BE IN A POSITION IF IT

08:15:34.571 --> 08:15:35.505
CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED AT THE

08:15:35.572 --> 08:15:37.207
LOCAL LEVEL OR AT THE COUNTY

08:15:37.274 --> 08:15:39.242
LEVEL THE STEP IN AND PROVIDE

08:15:39.309 --> 08:15:41.044
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

08:15:41.111 --> 08:15:42.712
POSSIBLY EVEN THE EQUIPMENT

08:15:42.779 --> 08:15:45.115
SPECIALLY IN THESE RURAL.

08:15:45.182 --> 08:15:47.150
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

08:15:47.217 --> 08:15:49.619
RELATIVELY SMALL BUDGETS SO I

08:15:49.686 --> 08:15:51.955
GUESS AS I'VE HEARD MY COMMENT

08:15:52.022 --> 08:15:53.123
READ THE COMMENTS FROM MY

08:15:53.190 --> 08:15:54.558
COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY GREW WITH

08:15:54.624 --> 08:15:57.494
THE IDEA THAT INDIVIDUALS NOT

08:15:57.561 --> 08:15:58.695
JUST FROM THE PUBLIC BUT THOSE

08:15:58.762 --> 08:15:59.763
WHO SERVE ON A BOARD OR

COMMISSION FOR A MUNICIPALITY

08:16:01.531 --> 08:16:03.700
OR COUNTY BE IN A POSITION TO

08:16:03.767 --> 08:16:06.503
PARTICIPATE AS WELL. BUT UNLESS

08:16:06.570 --> 08:16:09.573
YOU FIGURE OUT HOW THE BROWN

08:16:09.639 --> 08:16:11.708
ACT. THE UPON THIS IN THE

08:16:11.775 --> 08:16:14.811
CONSEQUENCES OF IT. MY CONCERN

08:16:14.878 --> 08:16:17.080
IS THAT. WE COULD BE OPENING UP

08:16:17.147 --> 08:16:20.350
A PANDORA'S BOX WITHOUT ANY

08:16:20.417 --> 08:16:23.587
REAL- SOLUTIONS. AT OUR

08:16:23.653 --> 08:16:25.255
DISPOSAL SO I WOULD

RESPECTFULLY YOU KNOW JUST

08:16:27.591 --> 08:16:28.024
THROW THIS OUT FOR YOUR

08:16:28.091 --> 08:16:31.328
CONSIDERATION. WOULD THIS NOT

08:16:31.394 --> 08:16:33.697
BE A SITUATION THAT. MORE CAN

08:16:33.763 --> 08:16:35.866
BE DONE TO SEE IF WHETHER THEY

08:16:35.932 --> 08:16:40.137
BE- MORE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS

08:16:40.203 --> 08:16:42.539
TO THE LEGISLATION AS WELL AS A

08:16:42.606 --> 08:16:44.608
BETTER ON THE SET OF

08:16:44.674 --> 08:16:45.375
DISCUSSIONS THROUGH BOTH

08:16:45.442 --> 08:16:48.044
HOUSES. TO BRING EVERYONE EXIT

08:16:48.111 --> 08:16:50.013
SIDE THIS HAS THE THIS HAS THE

08:16:50.080 --> 08:16:52.182
KERNEL OF A SIGNIFICANT

08:16:52.249 --> 08:16:54.451

PANDEMIC. I THINK MORE TIME FOR

REQUIREMENT ON TOP OF THAT

08:59:54.495 --> 08:59:56.864

THE SEMI LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

09:02:59.079 --> 09:03:01.882
FEASIBLE- FOR MANY OF THESE A

09:03:01.949 --> 09:03:03.884

09:03:50.397 --> 09:03:53.600
NARROW. IN SCOPE- TO REALLY

09:03:53.667 --> 09:03:56.537

UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE

09:04:19.593 --> 09:04:20.527
CONCEPT OF NOT HAVING THAT

THE- THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS

09:20:43.142 --> 09:20:45.478
BILL SEEMS MERITORIOUS I MEAN

09:20:45.545 --> 09:20:46.179
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE

09:20:46.245 --> 09:20:48.948
CERTAIN THAT WE REDUCE OR

09:20:49.015 --> 09:20:51.551
IDEALLY ELIMINATE TRAFFICKING-

09:20:51.617 --> 09:20:53.453
IN ORGANIZED CRIME THAT GOES

09:20:53.519 --> 09:20:57.857
ALONG WITH- THAT ELICIT-

09:20:57.924 --> 09:21:01.227
ENTERPRISE. THE ISSUE IS WHAT

09:21:01.294 --> 09:21:04.464
EXACTLY IS NOT WORKING WITH THE

09:21:04.530 --> 09:21:07.166
TWO OTHER EXISTING REGISTRATION

09:21:07.233 --> 09:21:10.236
AND COMPLIANCE. OUR REGION IS

09:21:10.303 --> 09:21:11.704
THAT WE HAVE BOTH FEDERAL AND

09:21:11.771 --> 09:21:14.407
STATE RIGHT NOW. IN ADDING THAT

09:21:14.474 --> 09:21:17.677
THIRD. YOU'RE WELCOME CLIENTS-

09:21:17.744 --> 09:21:19.145

SERVED IF WE IMPROVED IF

09:21:22.048 --> 09:21:25.351
NECESSARY. THE EXISTING STATE

09:21:25.418 --> 09:21:28.454
REGISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE-

09:21:28.521 --> 09:21:30.490
REGIME RATHER THAN CREATE A

09:21:30.556 --> 09:21:33.526
THIRD ONE SO I DON'T DISAGREE

09:21:33.593 --> 09:21:35.695
THAT THERE CAN BE IMPROVEMENTS

09:21:35.762 --> 09:21:37.730
IN WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AFTER

09:21:37.797 --> 09:21:39.465
THE WELFARE OF THOSE THAT ARE

09:21:39.532 --> 09:21:42.535
WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY-

09:21:42.602 --> 09:21:44.570
BECAUSE WE RELY ON THEM SO MUCH

09:21:44.637 --> 09:21:46.773
APPRECIATE WHAT THEY CONTRIBUTE

09:21:46.839 --> 09:21:49.108
TO. OUR INDUSTRY. BUT AT SOME

09:21:49.175 --> 09:21:52.045
POINT I MEAN. WHEN YOU HAVE

09:21:52.111 --> 09:21:54.580
THREE SEPARATE REGIMES THAT ARE

09:21:54.647 --> 09:21:56.716
RESPONSIBLE FOR IN MANY

09:21:56.783 --> 09:21:58.684
RESPECTS THE SAME THING- I

09:21:58.751 --> 09:22:01.587
DON'T SEE. WHY IT COULD BE

09:22:01.654 --> 09:22:04.590
TERRIBLY USEFUL. AND I THINK

09:22:04.657 --> 09:22:07.827
WITH THAT I WOULD- RESPECTFULLY

09:22:07.894 --> 09:22:09.996
LET THE AUTHOR KNOW THAT I

09:22:10.063 --> 09:22:12.065
APPRECIATE WHAT HE'S DONE BUT-

09:22:12.131 --> 09:22:15.568
WE TALK ABOUT THE REGULATORY.

09:22:15.635 --> 09:22:18.371

AND WHAT HAVOC THAT IS READ ON

09:22:31.017 --> 09:22:33.352
OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WE

09:22:33.419 --> 09:22:35.221
ARE HELD TO HIGHER STANDARDS IN

09:22:35.288 --> 09:22:37.790

REGULATION AND WELFARE AND

09:22:39.959 --> 09:22:42.795
LABOR- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

09:22:42.862 --> 09:22:45.031
NECESSARILY LOOK UPON WHAT IS

09:22:45.098 --> 09:22:47.700
OCCURRING AS SOMETHING THAT IS

09:22:47.767 --> 09:22:49.469
INHERENTLY FAULTY ESPECIALLY
