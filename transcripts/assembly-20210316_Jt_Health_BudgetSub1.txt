AND WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT EQUITY I'M REALLY TALKING ABOUT GEOGRAPHICAL EQUITY RIGHT NOW. CURRENTLY UNDER THE WHOLE PERSON CARES PILOT AS WELL AS THE HEALTHY HOMES PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING RUN BY THE STATE. THOSE ARE BEING ADMINISTERED IN TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN OUR STATE. REPRESENTING ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT IS NOT COVERED UNDER A WHOLE PERSON CARES OR HEALTHY HOMES. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A REAL BENEFIT TO THOSE PILOT PROGRAMS AS THEY'VE HELPSTO PROVIDE- REAL. RESOURCES FOR US ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP TO EXPAND THOSE SERVICES STATEWIDE WITH THE WHOLE PERSON- PERSON CARES APPROACH IN MIND AS POWER LINES. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT FACE DISCUSSION. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. CNN WILL GO AHEAD AND START- OUR FIRST PANELIST ON THE VARIOUS PROPOSED CHANGES INVOLVING THE NEW.

WELL GOOD AFTERNOON ALL DOCTOR AROUND THE WORLD IT WILL- A REAL LIFELONG HOME DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES JUST A FEW OPENING COMMENTS ALONG MORE J. C. COOPER DAHLE HOME WALK THROUGH RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK OF THE ITEMS BEING COVERED IN TODAY'S AGENDA. OR REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT REFORMS LIKE IMAGINE IN OUR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM- THROUGH HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT AND LITTLE OF SUBSTANCE WE CAN START TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH DOCTOR RANDALL SAID SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. ABOUT CONTRIBUTORS MUCH TO HEALTH OUTCOMES AS. ON DOES. DOES MANAGEMENT AND- ALL IT ALSO THE BODIES WERE US TOOLS ARE ADD TO ALMOST ACT. BULLS OF GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY STOCK PROGRAM. TOOK BECAUSE IT WILL CLOSER STATEWIDE FROM ALSO RACIAL EQUITY. BECAUSE IT WILL. MAKE THE MOST. PEOPLE AND THEIR NEEDS ARM AND- RELATED TO THAT IS THE FACT THAT WE WILL OFFER A REAL RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE PEOPLE. WHO WERE ADDED TO THE MEDICAL COVERAGE THROUGH THE EXPANSION WILL PERFORM THE PROGRAM REALLY WAS DESIGNED AS A HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM WELL TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND I THINK. WITH WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING HERE TODAY. WE START NOW ROAD MEETING- NEEDS SO REQUIRE ON TRADE TO COLLEAGUE. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. I'M SO STARTING WITH IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WE ARE STILL CONSIDERING IS AN ADDITIONAL NAME FOR THIS BUT ESSENTIALLY. ADDITIONAL ROCK SERVICES THAT CAN BE MADE TO INDIVIDUALS- WITHIN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE- THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING FOURTEEN DISTINCT SERVICES- WHICH ARE MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO SERVICES OTHERWISE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE PLAN- ONE THING WE DO I TRY TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR IS THAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL HAVE THE- OPTION TO OFFER. ON THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS IT DOES HAVE TO BE. AT THE OPTION OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WELL AS THE BENEFICIARY WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCEPT THE IN LIEU OF SERVICE OR TO RECEIVE THE STATE PLANS SERVICE INSTEAD- SO WE DO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT. THE FOURTEEN IN LIEU OF SERVICES- INCLUDE A- A RARE KIND OF HOUSING SERVICES ARE SUITES WHICH INCLUDE TRANSITION SERVICES HOUSING DEPOSITS TENDENCY IN THE STATE- SUSTAINING SERVICES. I'M AND THEN WHAT WE'RE TURNING AS SHORT TERM POST HOSPITALIZATION HOUSING ESSENTIALLY SIX UP TO SIX MONTHS OF- TEMPORARY HOUSING- AS SOMEONE TRANSITIONS FROM. AN INPATIENT STAY INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL CARE- INCLUDING- YOU KNOW A JAIL SETTING OUT TO TRANSITION TO YOU. ARE WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING RECUPERATIVE CARE WHAT'S ALSO BEEN KNOWN AS MEDICAL RESPITE AS WELL AS OTHER RESPITE SERVICES I'M TO GIVE CARE GIVERS ARE OTHERS AT A- REPRIEVE- AND THEY HAVE DILATATION PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE SET UP ACROSS LARGER URBAN AREAS- TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED IN A CENTRAL LOCATION- IN. FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES YOU CAN SET UP A DAY HABILITATION PROGRAM- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO HOMELESS POPULATION JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THERE. WERE ALSO HAVE A VARIETY OF- HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. OFTEN PROVIDED IN OUR NINETEEN FIFTY IN C. WAIVERS WANTING X. THAT THROUGH THE LIEU OF. ON THESE INCLUDE A NURSING FACILITY TRANSITIONS TO BOTH ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES- SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS FROM A NURSING FACILITY. TO SOMEONE'S HOME ARMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY THERE HE SERVICES WOULD COVER ON NOT ONLY THE TRANSITION FROM THOSE- LOCATIONS- TO THE HOME IT WOULD ALSO COVER FOR EXAMPLE ANY RAP SERVICES NECESSARY IN AN RCMP OR IN OUR FOR- AVAILABLE TO THAT BENEFITS YOUR ONCE THEY'RE PLACED IN THAT ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY. IT ALSO PERSONAL CARE IN HOMEMAKER SERVICES- HOME MODIFICATIONS AS NECESSARY TO KEEP SOMEONE SAFELY IN THE HOME A MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS SOBERING CENTERS AND ADDS ABOUT REMEDIATION. ARE YOU CAN SEE ON MANY OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES BEING OFFERED REALLY FOCUSED ON THE HOMELESS JUSTICE INVOLVED AGING POPULATION- AS WELL AS COMING COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES. THE EXAMPLE HERE OF RESPITE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S REALLY CHANGING IN REGARDS TO THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT WE ARE PROVIDING OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES SO THEY CAN RESIDE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WITH OUR FAMILY- WHEN THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE BUILT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE- OVER TIME WE HAVE DEVELOPED SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH BOTH THE HELP HOMES IN PARTS OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. ON THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN COUNTIES WITH THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A TRANSITION PLAN. TO THE DEPARTMENT- THAT WOULD START ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THOSE ARE THE TRANSITION PLAN IS DUE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WITH THE HELP OF THOSE AT TRANSITIONING IN LIEU OF SERVICES TO START IN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO US THROUGH THAT TRANSITION PLAN. HOW THEY ARE- WHICH INCLUDES SERVICES THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING AND HOW THEY WILL TRANSITION THOSE OUR HOPE. IS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER UP WITH THE EXISTING PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TODAY. I FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WHO ARE- PROVIDING MANY OF THESE SERVICES- THROUGH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY OF THEIR COUNTY COLLEAGUES- OR I WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES FOR EXAMPLE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS WITHIN THE COUNTY MAY BE REALLY GOOD CANDIDATES TO PROVIDE SOME OF THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR EACH CBS PROVIDERS TO DO THIS TODAY OF FOR EXAMPLE R. C. C. T. PROVIDERS TO DO TRANSITIONS TODAY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS UNDER MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE SEEN GREAT SUCCESS IN TRANSITIONING INDIVIDUALS TO ASSISTED LIVING ENVIRONMENTS FOR TO THEIR HOMES IN MAXIMIZING THEIR EXPERIENCE THERE. TO REALLY ENSURE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NOT. REINVENTING THE WHEEL FOR LACK OF BETTER SCRIPT IN BUT REALLY PARTNERING WITH THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WELL AND HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO DO YOU ARE THESE VERY UNIQUE SERVICES- EVENTUALLY IT WHAT WOULD HELP IS STATEWIDE BUT STARTING. THROUGH THE INDO OF SERVICES TO BEGIN. AS WE ABOUT HOW WE WERE. MONITOR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE'RE LOOKING. AT END OF COPPER. APPROACH TO ALL OF THAT I'M WITH EVERY LARGE TRANSITION WE USUALLY LOOK AT A NUMBER OF DOMAINS WE LOOK AT ACCESS TO SERVICES WE WILL LOOK AT SERVICE PROVISION- PROVIDER CAPACITY GRIEVANCE APPEALS- AS WELL AS OUTCOMES THIS WILL PLY TO IMPROVE SERVICES ALSO EVEN THOUGH IT IS OPTIONAL ONCE A MANAGED CARE PLAN A LACKS TO PROVIDE THE IN LIEU OF SERVICE. THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO STILL MEET LL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN REGARDS TO ACCESS COMMUNICATION- APPEALS EXCEPT ROB- I WHICH IS ALSO MENTIONED WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WHERE WE HAVE USED A VARIOUS OUTCOME MEASURES- LIKE IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. TO ASSESS THESE TYPES OF SERVICES DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE ALWAYS PROVIDED TYPICALLY BY AGE I MANAGED CARE PLAN- AND IN THE WHOLE PERSON HERE FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT ARE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE INLET TORY CHAIR EDIE VISITS WHICH IS THAT HE DOES MEASURE. INITIATION ENGAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG DEPENDENCE TREATMENT AS WELL AS FOLLOW UP AFTER HOSPITALIZATION FOR MENTAL ILLNESS ALL THREE HE DOES MEASURES OF WELL BEDDED MEASURES THAT REALLY ALLOW US TO TEST SOME OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE JUMPER CITIZENS THEM AS WELL AS THE PERCENT OF HOMELESS WHO ARE CURRENTLY HOUSE FOR GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS WE WILL HAVE TO FIND THE BALANCE OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO REPORT DAY ONE. BUT PUTTING A PIN THIS FOR LATER REALLY LOOKING AT OTHER MEASURES WHERE THROUGH THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS AVAILABLE THROUGH CALLING HOPING THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT MEASURES THAT CUT ACROSS DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO SHOW HOW WE'RE INTEGRATING AS WELL AS BRINGING IN SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THESE. OUTCOMES AND INCENTIVIZING SOME MAY BE HARDER TO REPORT OUTCOMES SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FROM A DATA. I'M SHARING POINT OF VIEW. THE DEPARTMENT PLAN ON A SURE BEST. FOR BOTH OUR PERSON AND HOMES- WITH OUR MANAGE CARE PLANS AND AS WE LEARN. FROM THE GROWTH OF THESE AND GO UP SERVICES A PLAN TO GO BEFORE OTHERS A REALLY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE A FEW ITEMS WITHIN THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT DO HAVE LIMITS. ON THE ONCE IN A AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFETIME LIMIT THAT YOU SAW- IN PARTICULAR AROUND SOME OF THE HOUSING RELATED IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ARE INTENDED TO BE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT ARE USED TO PROVIDE A BROADER HOUSING BENEFIT WHICH IS NOT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM- ALSO I WOULD NOTED THAT WHILE WE DID HAVE THE ONCE IN A LIFETIME LIMIT FOR SOME OF THOSE HOUSING OPTIONS. WE DID ADD BASED ON EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK. OPTION TO APPROVE AN ADDITIONAL TIME WITH DOCUMENTATION AS TO WHAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WHILE PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL HOUSING SERVICES. WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT SECOND ATTEMPT TO TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE WITHIN THOSE. OTHER LIMITS THAT YOU SAW LISTED WITHIN THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE VERY CONSISTENTWITH OUR EXISTING NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. AND HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED WAIVERS. ARE WHERE WE OFTENTIMES YOU HAVE TO SET VARIOUS LIMITS- REALLY USED TO ENSURE THAT. THEY ARE COST EFFECTIVE FOR EACH SERVICE THAT APPROPRIATE PRICING GUIDELINES AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE STRUCTURE FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR UNIQUE OFFERINGS AT THESE IN THE WEB SERVICE AS- AND THAT COMES OFF OF A LOT OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD IN THAT SPACE. UP FOR MANY YEARS- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THE LIMITS ARE REALLY INTENDED TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL ABUSE OR MISUSE OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES SUCH AS INSTANCES WHERE THEY'RE PROVIDING DELUDE SERVICE CAN MAYBE. NOT BE AS COST EFFECTIVE RELATIVE TO OTHER STATE PLANS SERVICES SOMETHING THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WHAT OFTEN HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DETERMINATIONS TO OFFER THESE IN THE WEB SERVICES. OR TO AUTHORIZE THEM FOR SOMEBODY'S USE. ADDITIONALLY WOULD JUST SAY THE PROPOSED UTILIZATION LIMITS WERE REALLY DEVELOPED WITH CONSIDERATION OF MEMBERS NEEDS AND REFINED THROUGH A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. DCS IS NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF PLANS TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO NON MEDICAL SERVICES TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF. HEALTH OR FOR THEM TO RESIDE SAFE WE THE HOME- WE'VE IT'S ACTUALLY THE COUNTRY. YEAH OF THESE THE WORKS. IN WITH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT REALLY ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE THESE LINAGES- AND PROVIDE THE BEST CARE FOR SOMEONE OFTENTIMES LESS COSTLY. ON THAN WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED OTHERWISE. WHEN IT COMES TO RATES ON A FEW THINGS TO POINT OUT AND WE'VE GOTTEN THIS QUESTION- RECENTLY SO WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING- THERE ARE SOME IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE RATE FROM DAY ONE FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE WE HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS THAT ARE PROVIDING IN LIEU OF SERVICES- FOR SOME OF THE HELP HOMES HOUSING COORDINATION SERVICES. THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED AND WE HAVE USED TO BE ON ENCOUNTER DATA- AND EXPERIENCE FROM BOTH OF THOSE TO INFORM WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET IN REGARDS TO THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. THEN DO YOU SEE AS WELL ALSO COLLECT IN LIEU OF SERVICES COSTS SEPARATELY FROM STATE PLAN SERVICES. ADMINISTRATOR PLANS BUILD UP THAT EXPERIENCE OVER TIME IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE BUILT INTO THEIR RATE- BUT SENSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE OPTIONAL. AND WE DO NOT HAVE THE SCHEDULE OF THOSE BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT WILL BE DONE OVER TIME IN BUILT INTO THE RATE AS THEY BUILD THAT EXPERIENCE- IN IN THEIR KIND OF MANAGED CARE PLAN. THE OTHER THING I'D POINT OUT IS THAT- IF WE NEED THAT EXPERIENCE TO BE IN THE RATES FOR A WHILE SO FOR EXAMPLE- THEY WOULD BE PROVIDING THE SERVICES FIRST THEN WE WOULD BUILD THAT THROUGH COUNTER DATA AND THEN THEY WOULD. IT WOULD BE SHOWN IN THEIR FUTURE YOUR RATES SO THE ONLY THING BEING BUILT IN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING TRANSITION FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND THEN AS PLANS ELECT AND PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IT WOULD BE BUILT IN INTO THE LATER YEARS. I'M I THINK THE DECISION WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL HAVE TO COMMUNICATE. WHAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE OFFERED TO MEMBERS THROUGH THEIR EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE- WHICH IS PROVIDED TO YOU ALL- THE BENEFICIARIES IN A MANAGED CARE PLAN. WE ALSO WILL HAVE A TAILORED NOTICES AND COMMUNICATION THAT WILL HAVE TO GO OUT TO MEMBERSHIP- WE KNEW IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ARE ARE OFFERED. WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW MANAGED CARE PLANS DO YOU BRING UP IN LIEU OF SERVICES EVERY SIX MONTHS. ARE WE CURRENTLY JUST CLOSE THE COMMENT PERIOD ON OUR MODEL OF CARE DOCUMENT WE OUTLINED. MANY OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN DETAIL PIECES FOR HOW THE MANAGED CARE PLAN WILL FILE THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THEN. LASTLY WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. WE REMAIN OPEN TO MANAGED CARE PLANS ADDING FUTURE IN LIEU OF SERVICES BEYOND THE FOURTEEN. HOWEVER DCS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE. THEY RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE UNLISTED IN LIEU OF SERVICES UNLESS THEY BECOME ADOPTED. AND ARE INCORPORATED INTO A PART OF THE FULL IN LIEU OF SERVICE STRUCTURE WITHIN THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACT. SO WE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR PLANS AS THEY EXPLORE THOSE. OPTIONS AND THIS. IS THE END OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE ANOTHER PANELIS THERE WAS LEFT OFF AN ADVERT IN THE AND THAT WOULD BE- M. J. DIAZ. WHO IS REPRESENTING SEIU SO SHE'LL BE SPEAKING. AT THE END OF THE PANEL SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT OUR NEXT PANELIST. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS NET REZNIKOV. LA I JUST HAVE A- A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS TO MAKE ABOUT INCLUDE SERVICES- FIRST OFF I'D I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT. WE NOW HAVE FOR ANALYSES OF CALAMP POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE- SO THE FIRST ONE WAS ABOUT. THE OVERARCHING ISSUES WITH IN CALAIS AND THEN WE HAD ONE ON. THE FINANCING OF CALAIS M. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY- AT THE END OF LAST WEEK AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK. WE POSTED AT ANALYSIS. OF EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS. IN CALAIS MAINE ALSO CALLEBS PROJECTED IMPACT ON SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND- WE DO EXPLORE IOS IT IN SOME DETAIL IN. BOTH OF THOSE TWO LATTER POSTS. THE BOTTOM LINE. FOR US WHEN IT COMES TO IOS IS THAT WE DO. SEE SOME BENEFITS TO THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE DO ALSO HAVE SOME. QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR PROPOSAL STILL AN AD. FORESEE SOME POTENTIAL ISSUES. THE BIGGEST OF THOSE ISSUES IS THAT. BECAUSE IT WILL BE LARGELY AT THE DISCRETION OF PLANS WHAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES THEY WILL OFFER. THE TYPES OF PLANS THAT THE TYPES OF BENEFITS THAT ARE. OFFERED. MIGHT VARY ACROSS THE STATE. ADDITION IT'S- IF THE- CHIU IN. CERTAIN OF THESE SERVICES. IN EVERY COUNTY SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES-WHETHER- THERE ARE PROVIDERS IN EVERY COUNTY THAT CAN ADD UP PARTNER WITH PLANTS PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WHETHER. THE HOUSING EXISTS TO. NAVIGATE NAVIGATE MEDIC HOW ENROLLEES TO- THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS- THE ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS THAT- BY MAKING THESE INTO MEDICAL SERVICES IT IT UNLOCKS A CONSIDERABLE FEDERAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE CERTAIN BENEFITS THAT AT. THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS FEDERAL FUNDING OR OTHERWISE- WE ALSO THINK THAT IT COULD AS A RESULT OF THESE SERVICES LEAD TO BENEFICIAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR A MEDIC CAL ENROLLEES AND- AFTER THAT- IT COULD POSSIBLY PREVENT THE NEED FOR COSTLY- MORE INTENSIVE. MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD- ADDITIONALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD REPRESENT A CONSOLIDATION OF. HEALTH HOMES AND A WHOLE PERSON CARE. THESE ARE BECAUSE THESE ARE TO- PRETTY SIMILAR PROGRAM SURVEYING OVERLAPPING POPULATIONS ARE WE DO FEEL THAT IT MAKES SENSE FROM A MINISTRY OF PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF REDUCING FRAGMENTATION. TO CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE HELLO WEST. I WAS BANNER. IN A TO THE CONCERNS I MENTIONED UP FRONT THAT WE DO WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER ONES I WON IS JUST A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO POSSIBLY CONSIDER ABOUT THE- UTILIZATION LIMITS THAT WERE MENTIONED WHICH IS- DO ALL OF THESE UTILIZATION LIMITS FOR THE RESPECTIVE SERVICES STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FISCAL PRUDENCE AND ALLOWING THE BUTTE BENEFITS TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR VERY HIGH NEED BENEFICIARIES. ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION- TO POTENTIALLY CONSIDER IS HOW COST EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATE. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND ASSURANCE IT IS IT IS AT LEAST POSSIBLE THAT IOS COULD LEAD TO INCREASING RATHER THAN DECREASING COSTS. ADDITIONALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE- THE POPULATION CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN HEALTH HOMES- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT EXISTING BENEFICIARIES ARE ARE TRANSFERRED INTO SERVICES THAT CONTINUE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND THEN JUST A ALASKA GENERAL POINT WHICH IS THAT- OVERALL CALIFORNIA HAS HAS TYPICALLY DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB WE FEEL OF THAT ALLOWING SERVICES TO VERY ACROSS THE STATE TO CONFORM WITH LOCAL NEEDS SAID EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY- BUT BUT IT'S BEEN MORE CHALLENGING TO BRING IN LESSONS LEARNED FROM. HOW PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN APPLIED DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO WITH THIS THIS BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF HOW TO HOW TO EVALUATE- I LOS AND DOES. TAKE SOME SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND JUST SERVICIOS WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS AT THE END OF EACH PANEL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT. PANELIST DR- KAREN HANS BERGER. YEAH SURE WOULD CHANGE YOUR ARAMBULA AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M HERE ENHANCE BURGER I AM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN. WE SERVE OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS MEDIC CAL MEMBERS- IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WE HAVE SEVEN THOUSAND PROVIDERS SAID OUR PRIMARY CARE AS WELL AS. SPECIALISTS AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS WITH MOST COMMUNITY BASED OR- THROUGHOUT THE IN THE EMPIRE. I APPRECIATE YOUR- TO TALK TO YOU TODAY THE FOR. PROPOSAL I'D LIKE TO START BY THAT I ATE P. APPRECIATE AND APPLAUD C. H. THE- FOR THEIR EFFORTS DURING INTO CAL. WE SPEAK HOW LAME THE NET. LEVEL OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. IS WELL WORTH THE PROGRAMS PROVIDE PERSON CENTRED CARE ADDRESS ALL AT OF HEALTH. WE HAVE ALL LEARNED THE WAY WITHOUT QUALITY FOOD OR ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU SIMPLY CANNOT MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH. THE COUNTY. UNIFIES THE CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL SERVICES. AS A MEDIC CAL BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN LIKE I H. P. AND THAT HELP US TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY ADDRESSING ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH THAT MAY BE IMPAIRING THEIR ABILITY TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. HISTORICALLY I THINK LEADERSHIP HAS INVESTED IN WHAT IS NOW CALLED IN WITH SERVICES. WE HAVE DONE THIS IN A LIMITED FASHION- BECAUSE OF THE COST THAT HAS BEEN TO THE PLAN AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY AND ARGUE COUNTY. WE'VE INVESTED IN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND CONGREGATE LILY LIVING FACILITIES. WHICH PROVIDE MEMBER CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE CARE IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND ALLOW THEM TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ARE INCLUDED IN THE LOWEST SERVICE OFFERING. WHICH INCLUDE HOUSING ACCESS TO FOOD TRANSITIONING ELIGIBLE MEMBERS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY SETTING. I SEE GOAL IS GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ADOPT AS MANY OF THE STATE'S PROPOSED ISLAND OFFERING AS POSSIBLE. AND WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING FORMS YOU ENGAGE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE TODAY TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. FROM WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED NEEDS THERE ARE SENATE EUROPE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. THE FIRST IN ORDER FOR I. SPEAKER THEN SURELY OFFER ALL THE ILO OUT ALL L. O. S. SERVICES IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU H. C. AT THE QUALITIES AND STANDARDS FOR POT FOR PROVIDER NETWORKS THE FLEXIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIES AND BASS FOR THIS AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO DEVELOP THE NATIVE WORK FORCE AND PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURES TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. AS YOU MAY KNOW I H. Q. Q. COUNTY FAILED OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES FROM BERGEN TO EXTREMELY RURAL AREA. THESE RURAL AREAS IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF CLINICAL PROVIDERS. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OFFERING I LOS SERVICES. THIS WILL BECOME EVEN MORE ACUTE WHEN WE ADD ADDITIONAL EXTREMELY ROLE THAT GOES TO OUR SERVICE AREA UNDER CALTRAIN. WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN BUILDING THE PHYSICAL AND WORK FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO BETTER SERVE THE POPULATION. NETWORK EXPANSION INVESTMENT WILL BE KEY TO OUR SUCCESS. AND THIS WILL SIMPLY TAKE TIME. NETWORK UNDER THE PROPOSED I WILL WITH SERVICES MUST BE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND THE QUESTION I WOULD PROPOSE IS SHOULD I A L. S. SERVICES THE HELP FROM SOME BENEFICIARIES BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS NOT YET BEEN BUILT THROUGHOUT THE FULL SERVICE AREA. SECOND CONCERN IS WHERE WORKFORCE IS AVAILABLE MANY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL NEED SIGNIFICANT HELP. IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE CBO'S ARE FULL OF PASSIONATE HEART LET PEOPLE DOING AMAZING WORK ON A SHOESTRING. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MANY DO NOT CURRENTLY POSSESS THE SOPHISTICATION REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT UNDER CAROLINE KITCHENETTE ENCOUNTER DATA WORKING HAVE THE SOPHISTICATED DATA SYSTEMS REQUIRED FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND HIPAA COMPLIANCE. ONE CANNOT UNDER ESTIMATE THE HEAVY LIFT REQUIRED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS. IT NEVER GET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT WILL BE REQUIRED TO HELP THEM BUILD THE CONNECTIVITY NEEDED EXTENDING WELL BEYOND A FEW WHETHER DARK. AND LASTLY AS PLANS WORK MEET THE JULY FIRST DEADLINE. WE'RE CERTAIN DELIVERABLES REGARDING THE IPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM DESIGN IT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE PROVIDE US WITH% FULL FINANCIAL DETAILS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE REQUESTING AT LEAST NINETY DAYS BEFORE PROGRAM DESIGN DOCUMENTS ARGUE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS DIFFICULT TO BUILD A HOUSE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY BRICKS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUY. THIS IS CRITICAL TO OUR PLANNING PROCESS. AND WILL ALLOW IT ACCURATELY DETERMINE WHERE WE WILL OR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER. ECM AND IOWA. IN CLOSING I COMMEND DH CS WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD SUCH A BOLD AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAM. ACCEPTING SO MANY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND FURTHER DESIGNING THE PROGRAM COMPONENTS AND FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK IMPLEMENT. IT IMPLEMENT IN LEWISBURG AT THIS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR HANS BERGER- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON NEXT TO OUR NEXT PANELIST LINDA WAY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY STATEWIDE ANTI POVERTY ADVOCATES. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS ASK NO FEEDBACK IT SERVES AS- WANTED TO SUPPORT CENTERS FOR THE HEALTH CONSUMER LINE AND NETWORKS CONSUMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OPERATED BY LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT STORY. AND IT KNOWLEDGE THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK ON THIS AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL. HOMELESSNESS DRAMATICALLY IMPACT HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ACCESS TO CARE ON AVERAGE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN KERR TWICE THE MEDICAL COSTS IN OTHER MEMBERS YET GUY OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN HEALTH PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR HEALTH COMMISSION. DATA SHOWS BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEED HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES SERVICES THAT HELP PEOPLE ACCESS AND SAVE A LIFE IN HOUSING BEFORE THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES OR LOWER THEIR COSTS. THE DEPARTMENT CREATED A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT AND THEN MEDICARE BENEFITS TO HELP HOMES PROGRAM WHICH IS AN ENTITLEMENT WE CO SPONSORED DEFINED HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES. ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGES BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEED HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES CAL AIM WILL ELIMINATE THESE PROGRAMS AND INSTEAD PROVIDE HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES AT THE PLAN OPTIONS TO INFLUENCE SERVICES. DESPITE INTENSE CALLIN WOULD HALT THE PROGRESS THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES. NO HOUSING SUPPORT BENEFIT. THE END CARE MANAGED BENEFIT ALL OFFER CARE. EVIDENCE OVER THIRTY SHOW CARE. NO HOW INTENSE THAT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE INTO OUT. IS IF PEOPLE STILL LET CANNOT GET FIRST HEALTHY AND THEY CAN. THEIR THAT THIS HELP THEM GET HAVE. DON'T IN PROPOSES CAN THIRTY AT THE OPTION TO IN THEIR- THE PROPOSAL A LITTLE FOR. SERVICES IN CENTER PAYMENT PROPOSED WILL RESULT IN TARGETING THOSE WITH THEM CUTE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND OLD SCHOOL MANY MA'AM. WHO'S TAKING MAY NOT BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY OR WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN GETTING NEEDED SERVICES AT ALL. IN FACT A NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT HAVE TOLD MY COLLEAGUE THAT THEY KIND OF TARGET ONLY THE TOP 1% OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. BUT THE HOUSING SUPPORT. IN LIEU OF SERVICES. THE PROPOSAL DID NOT. THE BIG CHALLENGES MET CAL PLAN BASED AND I DON'T THEM EXPERIENCING. AND PROVIDING CULTURALLY RESPONSE- ALTHOUGH ARE. BY THE SPANNED THAT PLAN ATTEMPT. WITH PERSON CARE AND HOW HOME PROGRAM FROM. YOU REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT. INCENTIVES TO DO SO CONTOUR TO KNOW PRACTICES IN CONTRACT WITH MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND CLINICS THAT THEY HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH. THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES YES STATEWIDE BENEFIT THEY CAN BE FACED INTO ALLOW PLANTS TO BUILD CAPACITY. WE BELIEVE THIS IS BEST DONE THROUGH A SUPPLEMENTAL PER MEMBER PER MONTH RATE AND THE MINISTER TO ASK THAT A STANDARDIZED GUIDELINES IN CONTRACTING PRACTICES. THAT WOULD ATTRACT PROVIDERS WITH THE EXPERTISE WHILE ALSO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR UP 2890% FEDERAL. MATCH THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU VERY. I GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO A J. D. DR I WOULD END UP ARAMBULA AND GDS HERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA AND ARE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS. TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES SPECIFICALLY ON THIS MANAGED CARE PLANS VOLUNTARY PROVISION OF I LOS WITHIN CAL AIMED. AS YOU KNOW SEIU MEMBERS ARE STRONG PARTNERS AND PROVIDERS REALLY LEADING THE WAY IN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND SUSTAIN WELLNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR MEDICAID ENROLLEES. I WILL SPECIFICALLY SPEAK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR PROVIDERS THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THE SERVICES LIKE THOSE PROPOSED TO BE OFFERED AS I LOS SUCH AS HOUSING TRANSITION NAVIGATION SERVICES. HUSBAND PAT AND DEACONS ENGLISH FROM THIS SHORT TERM POST STABILISATION HOUSING NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. OUR PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS HAVE THE SKILL SET AND TRAINING AS WELL AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE OF LOCALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO MAKE TIMELY AND DIRECT REFERRALS CONNECTING PEOPLE TO CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY OUR LONG TERM CARE PROVIDERS LIKE OUR HOME CARE AND NURSING HOME WORKERS HAVE SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND TRAINING TO HANDLE THE NEEDS OF THOSE IN THEIR CARE PRIMARILY THE ELDERLY AND MEET STANDARDS TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT THE NECESSARY LONG TERM CARE GIVERS. TO MEET OUR GROWING DEMAND FOR SUCH SERVICES. R. S. YEAH YOU PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE IN STATE OUTCOMES ON THE DELIVERY OF CARE OF PATIENTS AS WELL AS COST SAVINGS FOR THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE IN LIEU OF SERVICES PROPOSAL SHIPS MEDIKAL PROGRAM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IF MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE. FASHIONED GRANT SUCH SERVICES TO ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES AND WHAT TYPES OF PROVIDERS THEY WILL CONTRACT TO FOR SUCH SERVICES. WE BELIEVE MOST MANAGED CARE PLANS DO NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF. TO APPROVE ELIGIBILITY FOR AYE LOS MANY OF THESE ISLANDS SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY LOCAL COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY KNOW EXISTING LOCAL RESOURCES- AS WELL AS CERTIFIED LONG TERM CARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SPECIALIZED SKILL SET. THERE ARE FOURTEEN DEFINE OPTIONS FOR I LOS- THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN OFFER- AND WE KNOW THAT THE BENEFICIARY AS STATED BY- MISS COOPER HAVE TO ACCEPT THESE AS IN LIEU OF. ANOTHER DESIGNATED MEDICAL BENEFIT. BUT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THESE- ADDITIONALLY- I LOS MUST BE MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE FOR IT TO BE OFFERED. AND MUST BE EXPLICITLY CONTAINED WITHIN THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACT WITH THE GATES YES. IF THIS OCCURRED THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A STRONG DETAILED OVERSIGHT OF HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS. USER PROPOSED DISCRETION ON WHETHER TO OFFER THESE SERVICES AND HOW TO BUNDLE THESE. SERVICES ARE WE BELIEVE THE HDS MUST HAVE STRONG OVERSIGHT OVER THESE TRANSITION AND THE PROPOSAL SHOULD INCLUDE MORE DETAILS REGARDING CONSEQUENCES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO COME TO CONTRACTING AGREEMENT. I SPECIFICALLY ELEVATING OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE ISLANDS FOR NURSING FACILITY TRANSITION AND DIVERSE IT DIVERSION TO ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES- DHS WILL ALLOW MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS. OTHER DAY IN CASE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES HOME HEALTH- AND ARSC ARE AT THE OPERATING OPERATORS AS LONG AS THEY APPLY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE EXPERIENCE. BUT IN. ORDER TO ENSURE THE STANDARDS ARKANSAS AND THE STATE AND BETWEEN PLANS WE BELIEVE THE H. YET THE AGE THAT SHOULD SET SOME. STANFORD I CAN'T MONITOR APPLY TO ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS WE NEED TO GUARANTEE THAT ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THE PATIENT AND THE PATIENT'S- AND LASTLY WE DO ENCOURAGE DH CS TO DEFINE THE PARAMETERS. OF MANAGED CARE PLANS DISCRETION AND AUTHORITY IN DETERMINING THE COR PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES WITHIN I LOS AND THE APPROPRIATE CERTIFIED SKILLED PROVIDERS- ELIGIBLE FOR THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR RAMYA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MY FIRST QUESTIONS CAN BE PICKING UP- WHERE MG DEALS WITH S. YEAH YOU JUST PASSED SO THE QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S REGARDING THE DISCRETION OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. WHAT WHAT DOES HAPPEN IF- THE PLANS DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE IDEAL L. O. S. SERVICES EXCEPT ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE AS WE ARE IMAGINING IN IMPLEMENTATION. JESSICA BERMAN DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD JUST MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR AND IT'S IN OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT- WE ARE ACTUALLY REQUIRING THAT MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS- CONTRACT WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDE BOTH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH PROBLEMS IT'S ONLY IF IN WHICH THEY CANNOT COME TO AGREEMENT AND WE GIVE A- A VERY SHORT LIST OF REASONS OF WHICH WE WOULD FIND OUT REASONABLE- ONE INCLUDES THAT THE- INDIVIDUAL PROVIDING THOSE. IN LOVE SERVICES THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE TODAY NO LONGER WANT TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- AS BE PROVIDED THROUGH THAT TRANSITION PLAN THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER SO WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO ENSURE. THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE WHOLE PERSON CARE- IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING OFFERED BY COUNTIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH SYSTEMS TODAY TRANSITION OVER SUCCESSFULLY TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WITH DIRECT CONTRAST BETWEEN PLANS AND PROVIDERS. THAT BEING SAID- UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS IT- THAT MANAGED CARE PLAN DOES HAVE THE OPTION- TO PROVIDE THOSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS BUILD UP THE CAPACITY IN THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES- STATEWIDE- IS THROUGH THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS PROPOSED IN CALAIS WHERE WE WOULD HAVE. DOLLARS THAT COULD HELP BUILD CAPACITY FARTHER THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY I'M IN BOTH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH I'M JUST NOTATING THAT HELP COMES IS ALSO NOT STATEWIDE TODAY- AND SO- THE IDEA BEHIND THE INCENTIVES IS WHERE THERE AREN'T IN THE WEB SERVICES AVAILABLE ARE WHERE THERE'S NOT THE CAPACITY THAT WE CAN PAY FOR THAT WORKFORCE PAY FOR THAT CAPACITY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT JUST EMPATHIZING WITH PROVIDERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT TYPE. OF SERVICE AS INDICATED IN OUR AYE KELLY PROPOSAL AND LISTED UNDER ALLOWABLE PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY FOR MANY OF THE SERVICES JUST MENTIONED- WE OFTEN ARE LISTING SERVICES LIKE COUNTY PROVIDERS- THE HOUSING EXPERTS. ARE NOT MANAGED CARE PLAN AS JUST BE CLEAR. AND I DO WANNA FOLLOW UP AND ECHO WILL BE HER FROM- DOCTOR HAND BERGER WHO SAID THAT SHE SEES THIS AS A NECESSARY EVOLUTION OF MEDIKAL WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE AND CAL IMINT AND I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OVERALL. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THOUGH IS THAT WE HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NECESSARY THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING SERVICES AND SO I WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT- OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND OVERLAP HERE WITH I. O. L. O. S. SERVICES AND IF WE ARE COORDINATING SERVICES WITH THOSE AND IF NOT. WHY NOT. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY THERE IS- THAT NGUYEN IN LIEU OF SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. THERE WILL HAVE TO BE COORDINATION WITH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE CURRENTLY USING- A VARIETY OF BRAIDED FUNDING TO COVER THESE TYPES OF SERVICES TODAY. ONCE WE ALLOW FOR IT TO BE A MEDICAID SERVICE WHETHER THAT ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT AS A BENEFIT. OR THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE SERVICES- AND WE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING THAT ABILITY TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS AND PROVIDED STATEWIDE WHEN POSSIBLE. ON TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- IN WHICH CASE THERE MAY BE SOME FUNDS THAT ARE LOCALLY BEING PROVIDED THROUGH AN HSA OR OTHER MEANS WHICH WOULD THEN BE FREED UP TO BE. A REALLOCATED TO OTHER PRIORITIES- AND OR THERE MAY NEED TO BE UPGRADING OF FUNDING OF SERVICES- IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE THINK COUNTY PARTNERS WILL BE CRITICAL PARTNERS AS PROVIDERS IN BUT WE ARE. A BUILDING IN CALLING- AND SO I WOULD SAY JUST A LEVERAGES A LOT OF OUR LESSONS LEARNED FROM ACROSS THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE SEEN- WHETHER ITS PILOTS OR SMALLER PROGRAMS- AND ELEVATING THAT AT A LARGER LEVEL- RELYING ON THOSE WHO ARE EXPERTS TO BE THE PROVIDER- IN DRY DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT BE SUSTAINABLE. OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND NOT SUBJECT TO LOCAL BUDGETS AND- ALLOCATIONS- BUT- SUSTAINABLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. AND WHILE I WITH- DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN THAT THIS IS- QUITE EXCITING. AND INNOVATIVE AND FORWARD THINKING I- WILL CONTINUE TO- PROCESS FORWARD FOR PROGRESS. AND WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT HAS SHOWN GREAT SUCCESS. IN BOTH BEING COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS- BEING HELPFUL FOR PATIENTS IN THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEAL PROGRAMS. TO WALLETS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE AYE A LITTLE LESS BENEFITS. IT'S CURRENTLY NOT A COVERED BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE ALLEN WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE LOOKING TOWARDS THIS PILOT AS- A BENEFIT THAT WE CAN- PROVIDE STATEWIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- QUESTION FOR DOCTOR COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR DR HANS BERGER. YES SIR SO ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY ARE ANY OF THE PROPOSED UTILIZATION CONTROLS GOING TO LIMIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE I. O. S. I. L. O. S. IN OPTIONS. I WOULD- I THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THE IOWA SERVICES AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK FOR MY COUNTY IT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT FOR A PLACE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO OR PLACES IN THE BAY AREA WHERE THE SERVICE AREA IS VERY TIGHT AND FAIRLY UNIFORM BUT IN OUR AREA WE HAVE QUICK BASKET PRINCES IN- AND EVEN ABILITY TO DELIVER IT SERVICES AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DELIVER THEM. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE CONTROLS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY ARE GOING TO BE A ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DELIVER OUR LEMONADE ARE BILITY TO DELIVER AND WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE NOW AND WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BE BUILDING THEM OVER TIME I ALSO THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH BECAUSE THEY WILL THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SERVICE AREA ON THAT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL- EDUCATION PROCESS WITH PRE AUTHORIZATION AND- APPEAL RIGHTS AND ALL THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE POPULATION TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR BEST WITH THE LOWEST SERVICES AS WE CONTINUE. TO BUILD THE PLANE AS WE FLY IT. WELCOME THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGE A LOT OF- BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSE NATURE I MEAN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SAN BENITO COUNTY ARE HUGE COUNTY SO THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD HAVE. THESE SERVICES DISPERSED AND EVENLY CROP THAT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IS. GOING TO WOULD BE A TOUGH TO ATTAIN SO- APPRECIATE THAT SO WHAT IS IT WHAT WHAT IN THOSE SERVICES IS AYE AJP CONSIDERING. WELL I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE ALREADY DO- WE HAVE AS SMALL HOUSING PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE HOUSES OVER TWO HUNDRED OF OUR HIGH UTILIZED THEIR- HIGH COST TO LOOK MEMBERS. THAT IS- WE PARTNERED WITH RANDY AND- ARE LOOKING AT OUR OUTCOMES. AND HEALTHY IN THAT IT HAS BEEN A COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT HAS IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF CARE. FOR THE MEMBERS IN THAT PROGRAM- SO WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY TO CONTINUE ON THAT PROGRAM SO LOW INCOME HOUSING IS NOT. AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. AND SO EVEN JUST THE RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO PUT. OUR MEMBERS INTO SUPPORTED HOUSING IS LIMITED- WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY ROBUST- PROGRAMS AROUND THAT NUMBER IF YOU ARE IN- JUST- YOU'LL CARE IN DOWN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. FOR THOSE THAT QUALIFY WE WORK TO MOVE THEM OUT INTO A COMMUNITY SETTING. LIKE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN YOUR SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR BACK INTO ITS FAMILY- DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND WHETHER THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT. WE ARE- STARTING A PILOT FOR MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS THAT- WILL BE STARTING IN THE NEXT COUPLE. OF MONTHS. AND WE HAVE- WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE AS THE- EVERYBODY HAS HARPER MEDIATION WE'VE ALWAYS THAT OUT NEED REMEDIATION. AND IN A SMALL WAY OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT BEEN- REIMBURSABLE SERVICES AND SO WE HAD TO CHOOSE MEMBERS THAT WE REALLY FEEL WERE USING EMERGENCY ROOM ON A REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE OF- THAT HIT HOME CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE LIVING IN AND THAT HAS ALSO BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND SO DOES THE SOME OF THE ONES THAT WOULD KIND OF COMES. TO MIND AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY. I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THANK OF THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION- I THINK THE PROPOSAL HAS A LOT OF PROMISE OF MY STAFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS OPTION FOR PER FOR YEARS NOW. THE ONE THING I WANNA MAKE SURE IS THAT WE INTEGRATE THE SERVICES THAT PLAN PROVIDE WHICH- AND THE SERVICES OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDE. I'M NOT SURE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS REALLY EXIST- MATT AND NOW AT LEAST AT LEAST IS NOT IS A PARENT IS IT IS IT MIGHT BE. BUT HAVING A HEALTH PLAN INVOLVED IN HOUSING HOMELESS IS POTENTIALLY A BIG CHANGE IN WHAT THEY DO- AS WE SEE FROM I. H. P. THEY'RE DOING THAT- THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW SO. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IT'S GOING WELL THAT THE CONNECTIONS ARE HAPPENING LOCALLY THAT PLANS ARE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL. AND THAT THIS OPTION IS BEING IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. THIS IS A QUESTION FOR J. C. THANK YOU SO ANYTIME WE IMPLEMENT LARGE CHANGES ESPECIALLY SOMETHING AS LARGE AND COMPLEX HAS A CALENDAR OUT WE DO HAVE- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN CONSTANTLY KIND OF GAUGE HOW THINGS ARE GOING UP WE WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR TRANSITION REPORTING REQUIRED HERE SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW- HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING THE ON THE WEB SERVICES- AS WELL AS IF THEIR GRIEVANCES OR APPEALS BEING FILED WITH THE PLAN IN REGARDS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. THAT REALLY ALLOWS AS WITH ANY NEW BENEFIT OUR TRANSITION TO REALLY KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING- WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE ENTIRE SEASON WE CAN BUILD UP AND GATHER PEOPLE TO DISCUSS HOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION- OR WHETHER WE'RE JUST HAVING A LOCAL ISSUE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITHIN A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- AND SO WE WILL WE WILL DO THAT THROUGH THIS TRANSITION TO KEEP AN EYE IN REGARDS TO IT WILL ALSO- BE ENCOURAGING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO IMPLEMENT AS MANY OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES AS THEY CAN YOU KNOW THAT MANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO THEM ALL AT. ONCE THAT'S A HUGE LIFT WE UNDERSTAND THAT- BUT- MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS IN REGARDS TO THOSE BEING AVAILABLE ON AND THEN IN REGARDS TO YOUR COMMENT IN REGARDS TO PARTNERSHIP WITH SISTER DEPARTMENTS ESPECIALLY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES UP WE HAVE ENGAGED EARLY AND OFTEN OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REGARDING OUR IN- IN LIEU OF SERVICES IN PARTICULAR- PROPOSAL ESPECIALLY AROUND. OUR HOUSING COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR THE REVIEW COMMENTS FEEDBACK- WE'VE INVITED THEM TO VARIOUS TABLES AND WE PARTNER ON OFTEN- END AS WE BEGIN TO EXPLORE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE WILL BE PROVIDING TO OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY AROUND IN LIEU OF SERVICES I THINK THAT WE WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES A PUBLIC HEALTH- AND OTHERS. I HAD TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE I BRING IN ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE TABLE LEVERAGES THE X. THAT I. THERE AND- ONLY TO YOU IMPROVE THE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE. AS MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CAN RECEIVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AS POSSIBLE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOTHING WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND- I'M SORRY. DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION MISTER ROBERTS. WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS THANK YOU AND I JST WANNA THANK YOU FOR- ACKNOWLEDGING THE SEMINOLE COUNTY HAS A LARGE SQUARE MILES- WITHIN THAT AREA TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION. OF THESE THESE- MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES BUT I ALSO WANT TO CHIME BACK. ON THE REQUEST AS FAR AS- GIVING GETTING SOME LEAD TIME AS FAR AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BUILD OUT. OF WHAT'S NEEDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I KNOW ON THE SPEAKER THING WAS DR HANS BERGER THAT BROUGHT IT UP AS FAR AS A- A NINETY DAY LEAD WAY- AS FAR AS SOME OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND BUILDING OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. I WONDER IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE- FEEDBACK ON THAT OR SOME. COMMENTS ON THAT FROM FROM OUR STAFF. YES THANK THANK YOU THANK MISRABA SO THIS COOPER COMMENTS ON. YES SO ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ACTUALLY- RELEASED ABOUT. A FEW WEEKS AGO A VERY DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONTRACT LANGUAGE BETWEEN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND- THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS. WE ALSO RELEASED THE MODEL OF CARE DOCUMENT. AS WELL AS- A CODING GUIDANCE FOR A COMMENT- I APPLAUD THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THOSE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES. YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE AWARE OF IN REGARDS TO THE TRANSITION- SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE COME AND WE CAN GET THOSE OUT. WE'RE ALSO COMMITTING TO GETTING RATES OUT. FAR SOONER THAN WE EVER DO JUST TO BE CLEAR ON ANY TRANSITIONS THAT WE DO WITHIN MANAGED CARE. UP AND WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE- OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS NEED TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. I'M AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION OUT- TO YOU ARE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS SOON AS WE- CAN- AND THEN WE ALSO ARE WORKING. ON IN IN LIEU OF SERVICES FEE SCHEDULE- THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDS TO RATE. LEVERAGE NATIONAL PRICING OF OTHER STATES THERE'S A- AREAS WHERE WE HAVE VERY SOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S BEING PROVIDED. I'M IN THAT IS ALSO SCHEDULED TO COME OUT. EARLY- SUMMER. I ALSO THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDERS. HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS THEY'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS- AND SO WHAT I WOULD SAY THE DEPARTMENT'S VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING ALL- INFORMATION OUT TO MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DECISIONS- TO CONTRACT- INFORM THEIR NETWORKS AND FILE ALL OF THEIR MODEL OF CARE DOCUMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. OF BASED ON THE TIMELINE SCHEDULE WHICH WE HAVE RELEASED- AND THEN LASTLY WE ARE WORKING ON THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. IN HAVING THAT PROPOSAL WHICH WILL GO OUT FOR ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- ALLOWING US TO ALSO GET. ON ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS OUT SO THAT I COUNTIES AND PLANS CAN. CONTINUE TO DO THAT. ADDITIONAL BUILDING UP AND SERVICES. OKAY OKAY WITHIN YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT GO AHEAD MOVE ON FOR A SECOND PANEL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PANEL TO ON THE PROPOSED ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WE HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FROM JC COOPER TO RECOMMEND REZNIKOV. MEMORIES OF ALLAH LINDA WAY JULIE WALLACE PARA MAKE DETAINING AND PAULA WILL HELP. LET'S BEGIN WITH JC COOPER. THANK YOU- IT SO ONE OF THE THINGS IN REGARDS TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT ON WHAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HIGHLIGHTING IS CURRENTLY ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF- CARE MANAGEMENT OR CASE MANAGEMENT IN THEIR CONTRACTS THE FIRST IS- BASIC CASE MANAGEMENT IN THE SECOND IS COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT- AND OFTEN TIMES MANY OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NCQA ACCREDITED AND THEY'RE LINING THEIR COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS A WITH THE NCQA REQUIREMENTS HERE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL CARE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT WITHIN THEIR CONTRACT- CALLED ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. IN REALLY THERE MAY BE SOME OVERLAP WITH THE COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT CATEGORY BUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HIGHEST NEED BENEFICIARY WITHIN ON THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS RESPONSIBILITY- IT IS THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE VERY HIGH BOTH- YOU KNOW PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS OUR HELP STATUS ARE COMPLEXITY MAYBE OUR ADDITIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES OR REALLY IMPACTED NEGATIVELY BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OR SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HELP- WHERE SOMEONE IS NAVIGATING ACROSS MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS HAVING MANY OF THE SOCIAL FACTORS IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY TO YOU- HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO IT'S YOUR MOST COMPLEX BENEFICIARIES- ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S JUST AN IMPORTANT PIECE TOUCH TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG IN REGARDS TO THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED IT REALLY IS ABOUT ADDRESSING BOTH THE CLINICAL AND NON CLINICAL NEEDS OF OUR BENEFICIARIES. AS WELL AS GOING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SO ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES AROUND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE- A CARE MANAGEMENT OR CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PROVIDED WHERE SOMEONE IS JUST REACHING OUT TO SOMEONE ON THE PHONE IT IS REALLY MEANT AND DESIGNED TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS TO BE COMMUNITY BASED ON IF YOU LOOK AT THE TYPES OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- TARGET POPULATIONS IT'S NOT ONE THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO YOU. ARE REALLY JUST A PHONE BASED PIECE I'M REALLY TRYING EMPHASIZE. THAT CAN. OF IN HERE CARE MAN IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A CARE MANAGER WILL CALL THE BENEFICIARY BUT IT'S REALLY MEANT TO BE ON THE GROUND. FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IF SOMEONE IS JUST DOING OUT REACH WERE HOPING THAT THEY CAN GET THEM ON THE PHONE. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE A STREET BASED TEAM WHO'S OUT THERE ENGAGING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL BUILDING THAT TRUST OVER TIME. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM HOPEFULLY INTO YOU- AND PROVIDED WITH SOME OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES AS WELL AS INTO YOU ANY NEEDED CARE- THAT THEY'RE NEEDING- OR MAY HAVE BEEN NOT PROVIDED. THE OTHER THING THAT'S UNIQUE AROUND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT YOU'LL SEE IT IN OUR THE POST A CONTRACT LANGUAGE IF YOU ARE TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING THE SINGLE. CARE MANAGER FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL OFTENTIMES INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT ARE SEEKING SERVICES ACROSS. MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS A MEDIC CAL IS VERY COMPLEX- WE HAVE. A LOT OF THINGS CARP OUT OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY CAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR SOMEONE TO NAVIGATE THESE VARIOUS A DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AND BY BEING ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER YOU ARE TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING THAT COORDINATION ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR THAT BENEFICIARY. ON ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE FOR PEOPLE TO CONSIDER. SO FOR IN HIS CARE MANAGEMENT- WE ARE AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY OTHERS IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS IN THIS HEARING PROPOSING TO REPLACE OUR CURRENT HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM. AS WELL AS TRANSITIONING ON THE WHOLE PERSON CARE- PILOTS- INTO THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT. BENEFITS WE ALSO THINK THAT IT IS VERY COMPLEMENTARY RATHER THAN DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO HELP KIND OF BRIDGE SILOS FOR SOME OF OUR MOST. MEDICALLY COMPLEX. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ALSO HAVING THOSE SOCIAL FACTORS IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY- SHE RECEIVED SERVICES. THE OTHER THING WE WOULD ON THAT NOTE TAKE HERE. IS THAT WE WILL BE ISSUING GUIDANCE AND WE'RE- TO WHERE THEY'RE IS OVERLAP BEING- AT. OF COORDINATION I SOME OF THE PIECES I WOULD FLAG FOR YOU INCLUDE THAT TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT PROVIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE OUT REGARDS HOW THIS WILL INTERACT WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDED BY. TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT PROVIDED BY OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AS THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES THAT THINKS RUBIO ON HOW THAT WORKS GIVEN THE BENEFIT THERE. AND THEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS- CASE MANAGEMENT FOR OUR CCS OF BENEFICIARIES ARE CHILDREN. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THOUGH IS. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE SILOS PIECES IT JUST HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LISTED IN IN HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT. EGGMAN NEED FOR THIS HIGHER LEVEL BENEFIT OF BEING AVAILABLE FOR THEM. SO ANOTHER THING JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR ALL SEVEN ENHANCE YOUR ENJOYMENT TARGET POPULATIONS ARE MANDATORY POPULATIONS. THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING. TAILORED ECM PROGRAMS FOR ALL TARGET POPULATIONS WORKING WITH PROVIDERS WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN THOSE PARTICULAR POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE- EIGHT AND A HALF CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER PROBABLY WON'T BE THE SAME ONE WORKING ON- INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION INTO THE COMMUNITY- AS YOU WOULD BE HAVING SOMEONE CONTRACTED FOR. CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH HIGH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS AND THAT WILL BE EXPECTED ON THERE WILL NOT BE A LONG LIST OF PROVIDERS WHO CAN MEET ALL OF THE VARIOUS TARGET POPULATIONS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW KEY PARTNERS LIKE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WHO REALLY ARE TO PROVIDE A REALLY DIVERSE AMOUNT OF THESE SERVICES TODAY THROUGH A WHOLE PERSON CARE- HI LET'S. SO MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONTRACT WITH COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE ECM SERVICES ON INDIVIDUALS LIKE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS OF THE MENTIONED ARE COUNTY PARTNERS ESPECIALLY FOR. THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT- THE TARGET POPULATION AROUND THE INDIVIDUALS. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE EVEN PUT IN OUR UP TO GUIDE WE WILL IT'S MANAGED PLAN TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES WE ALSO EXPECT THAT IF THAT INDIVIDUAL I'M IS ALREADY RECEIVING SERVICES THAT THEY BEAT AND THERE ARE A CONTRACTED ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. THE BIG IT DEFAULTED AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED TO THAT COUNTY ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER WE ALSO KNOW THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN THE SPACE A REP ESPECIALLY AROUND. ON SOME OF THE HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHO ARE OUT DOING MANY OF THIS SOMETIMES THROUGHOUT THE LAND TO BE FUNDING SOMETIMES TO OTHER SOURCES- AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONTRACTING PROVIDE THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT UM SERVICES. REALLY WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE AND BUILD THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE RELATIONSHIPS AND PROVIDER EXPERIENCE TO PROVIDE THIS TO OUR BENEFICIARIES. ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO YOU- THE PERCENTAGES OUT THERE ARE WE GET THIS QUESTION A LOT. TO HELP HOMES CURRENTLY TARGET SOME OF THE HIGHEST RISK IN REGARDS TO ABOUT THREE TO FIVE PERCENT- BUT THAT'S WHO THEY'RE TARGETING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE. ARE ACTUALLY BEING ENGAGED IN THE PROGRAM- WHOLE PERSON CARE HAD SIMILARKIND OF TARGETS FOR OUR REGION ENROLLMENT. UNDER DCS EXPECTS THOUGH WITH THAT TYPE OF PERCENT OF WHO YOU'RE ENGAGING WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE. ON THAT ABOUT 1% OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE POPULATION- THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING ACTUALLY GIVING BEING GIVEN ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES- STONE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD ENGAGE IN OUTRAGE AND THOSE WHO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE. ON THESE BENEFICIARIES ARE REALLY COMPLEX- AND MANY OF THEM MAY NOT BE. WILLING OR ABLE. TO ENGAGE AND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THROUGH BOTH A WHOLE PRSON CARE PILOTS AND OUR HEALTH HOME PROGRAM. IN REGARDS TO HOW HARD IT CAN BE TO REALLY WORK WITH SOME OF THESE OUR POPULATIONS. AS WE TOOK A LOT OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED TO INFORM ON THE THAT THE PERCENTAGES FOR THIS HIGHEST NEED OUR POPULATION- SOMETIME MY PIECES TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE TRACKING SO- WE ARE PROPOSING THAT BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWO YOU ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN COUNTIES WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- AND- OR HELP THOSE PROGRAMS. WOULD BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN WHOLE PERSON CARE OR HELP HOMES- BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND COUNTIES WITH OUT WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- INDOOR HELTON'S PROGRAMS WOULD BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT- ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT BENEFITS FOR THE- SELECT POPULATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT IN ADVANCE BASED ON OUR MODEL OF CARE- GUIDANCE THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED. IT WOULDN'T PRECLUDE H. COUNTY OR I'M SORRY A MANAGED CARE PLAN- WHO. DOES NOT HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT OUR HELP COMES. TO NOT GO LIVE IN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY DO YOU THINK. THE- THE LARGE. IN LIEU HERE OF ARE INSISTING MAJOR WOULD GO WITH THAT JOE. TWO THREE TWO PERIOD- AND THEN FINE- ALL TARGET POPULATIONS ACROSS ALL PLANS HAVE TO BE UP AND FUNCTIONAL BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO WE DO HAVE SOME PHASING AND NOT WAS A BASED OFF OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT WE OT. ON THE WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS AND IS IN THE UPDATED PROPOSAL. ADDITIONALLY IN HERE AFTER MANAGEMENT WILL BE BUILT INTO THE RATE STARTING JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT WILL SHOW UP IN THE RATE- DEVELOPMENT TEMPLATE. HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED AT THIS TIME BUT IT WILL BE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED TO BE CAN CLEARLY SEE AND- RESPOND. ON THE ENCOUNTERS AND THE AT THE RATES AT SPECIFIC TO ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT SOMETHING WE REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SO I WON'T REITERATE IT WE DO HAVE POST IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING. AROUND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT INCLUDING- SERVICE PROVISION MEMBERSHIP GRIEVANCE APPEALS PROVIDER CAPACITY QUALITY XTERRA. WE WILL BE WORKING ON HOW WE WILL BE EVALUATING ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT I MENTIONED EARLIER HOW WE'VE DONE THAT THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE. AS WELL AS HELP HOMES- BUT REALLY FOCUSING ON BOTH ANNUAL MEDIC A MEDICAL AUDITS AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR HE JUST MEASURES TO HELP US- QUANTIFY. OF THE OUTCOMES OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- AND THEN LASTLY WE REALLY WILL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE AN IN BUILT ON THE LESSONS LEARNED. THAT WE HAVE FROM BOTH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH PROBLEMS- REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE LEVERAGING AND LIFTING UP. SOME WILL INCLUDE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULAR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS A COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. AS WELL AS OF REALLY FOCUSING ON THE OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT OF MEMBERS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF OUR LESSONS LEARNED YOUR WHOLE PERSON CARE ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THESE COMPLEX. OUR POPULATIONS. THAT WERE FOCUSED ON. INVESTING IN YOUR LOCAL PROVIDER STAFF TRAINING IS GOING TO BE. OF FOR THE- IMPLEMENTING. AS WELL AS COORDINATING AND PARTNERING WITH OUR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND LASTLY ENSURING COMMUNITY PROVIDERS HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATA SHARING BILLING AND CODING REQUIREMENTS. OPT FOR THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT UP HE SAYS- AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH C. H. THE F. AND OTHERS TO REALLY DIG INTO THAT DATA SHARING. AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT THEY BE AT THE TABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS. IN THIS SPACE AS WE START BRINGING CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL WORLDS TOGETHER. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE ENHANCED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I AND SO THIS IS THE REMAINDER OF MY COMMENTS ON ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT AND LOOK FOR TO QUESTIONS WHEN IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MAD REZNIKOV WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU. FIRST OFF I JUST WANTED TO MENTION AGAIN THE- CLOSE THAT WE'VE WRITTEN ABOUT EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS AND INTEL AND THAT IS NOW AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WHERE WE- WE- DISCUSS ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. IN SOME DETAIL. JUST A- COUPLE OF BRIEF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS- AND- YOU SEE A PROPOSAL- FIRST OF ALL- WE DO THINK THAT- THIS PROPOSAL DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO. IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE- TARGET POPULATION AND THAT IT MAKES A LOT OF. SENSE TO YOU- DIRECT MORE RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST HEALTH CARE UTILIZES WITHIN MEDICO- BUT- OUR OUR OUR- ONE NINE MAJOR QUESTION ON THIS IS UP. WHETHER THE- AT. THE CRITERIA FOR WHO FALLS INTO- YOU TO THE TARGET POPULATION IS. OVERBROAD WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WAS INTENDING TO TARGET. POSSIBLY THE- THE 1% TOP 1% OF- UTILIZE YOUR ITS WITH A MEDIC CAL. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE- THE WAY THAT THE CRITERIA IS DRAWN RIGHT NOW COULD COULD CAPTURE A LARGER POPULATION THAT THAT- BUT BUT THAT'S- THAT'S REALLY- IT. IT FOR MY COMMENTS SO- THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WILL GO A AND MOVE ON TO- ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD SHARE ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MERRY THE VOLATILE HEALTH DIRECTOR FROM LA CARE HEALTH PLAN- IS THE NATION'S LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN WITH OVER TWO POINT TWO MILLION MEDICAL MEMBERS SERVED ACROSS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT CARRYING PROPOSAL REINTRODUCE. AND WE GIVE THE COURT A LOT OF THE GOALS AND INITIATIVES UNDER THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL. IN PARTICULAR WE'RE LOOKING TO CARRY FORWARD SOME OF THE SUCCESSES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR HEALTH SOME PROGRAM. THIRTY FOUR WE HAVE SEEN THERE ARE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED OFTEN RATE. THAT MEMBERS ARE EXCITED AND INTERESTED IN THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER HEALTH HOME. AND A SIX CORE SERVICES WILL CARRY OVER AND BEAT A SIX CORE SERVICES UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. WE'VE SEEN UP OUR PROGRAM OPTIONS TO HELP HOMES. AND SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED CARE MANAGEMENT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE UP TO ONE IN Q. MEMBERS. OPTED INTO THE PROGRAM. THAT NUMBER GOES HIGHER WHEN WE TARGET THE RIGHT PROVIDER MEMBER RELATIONSHIP SO. AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE AT THE BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE AND FINING MEMBERS TO THE RIGHT PROVIDERS WERE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS ARE PRESENT ONE POSSIBLE. WILL REALLY ENHANCE THE OPTIONS AND ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. WE'VE ALL FIFTEEN THAT THE SERVICES UNDER HEALTH HOMES IN UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN THE FUTURE. ARE CRITICAL FOR THIS GROUP OF HYBRID MEMBERS PARTICULARLY DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND AS WE LOOK TO EXIT THE PANDEMIC IN THE FUTURE. UNDER HEALTH WE SAW THAT OUR COMMUNITY BASED CARE MANAGEMENT ENTITIES OR TV CAN MEET OR ABLE TO HELP OUR INVOLVED MEMBERS WHO NEEDED IMPORTANT ACCESS TO FOOD. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES. HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER RESOURCES CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE MEMORY THERE WAS AN SSET TO HAVE ACCESS TO A CARE COORDINATOR AND IF HE CAN MEET. HE WAS ABLE. TO PROVIDE THEM THE NEEDED INFORMATION. AND REACHED THAT HOW HOMES HAS PROVIDE AND FACILITY STRONG RELATION WITH THE HEALTH. CAN YOU BASED PROVIDE AND OUR CALVET. PARTNERS AND WE TRANSCEND OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT ONLY CARE WITH OUR FIVE OTHER HEALTH PLANS SERVING LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WE COME TOGETHER REGULARLY TO TRY TO ALIGN ON THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AT OUR HEALTH HOME. AND ARE TALKING. ABOUT HOW TO ALIGN UNDER ECM. WHAT ABOUT THE STRENGTH THAT ARE REALLY WITH THE COUNTY ENTITIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. UNDER THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE UNDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP HOMES. AND WE LOOK AT THE THAT CONTINUE AS WELL AND- ECM. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL. THAT STARTED THROUGH LA KERR IS INVESTMENT. AT THE BEGINNING OF HEALTH HOMES ON READING OF ACTIVITY. WHERE WE AWARDED ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN START UP GRANTS YOU A SELECT PORTION OF OUR TV TNT. UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO AWARD FUNDS TO ALL OF THEM- UTILITY FUNDING BUT- THIS WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING PREPARE THE ORGANIZATION FOR HELP HOMES. WE CONTINUE DOCTOR VARIETY OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LEARNING AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING BI WEEKLY WEBINARS. THAT HAVE RUN THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN TO CONTINUE TO RUN EVERY OTHER FRIDAY. AND ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE ALLEY CARE NETWORK SO THAT BENEFIT REALLY CASCADE ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTY- AND YOU PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT ONLY WORKING WITH LA CARE. BUT OTHER HEALTH PLANS SERVING L. A. COUNTY. SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE FIXED AT UNDER. WHAT CAN DO WE- WITH REGARDS HE ON. FIRST OF AND MOST THE PROPOSAL S VERY AMBITIOUS AND THE TIMING IS AGGRESSIVE WE WANTED UNIT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT RIGHT. AND WE'RE ALREADY IN MID MARCH WHICH MEANS WE HAVE NINE AND A HALF MONTHS LAST UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE PLANS ARE DILIGENTLY WORKING TOWARDS READING IT BUT YOU CAN IN A BIG WAY. FINDING AND THE- IN. THAT IS GOING TO BE LARGE FOR ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES. WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE COULD BE THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND HEALTH HOME TODAY. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HELP FROM MEMBERS AND OUR- WHOLE PERSON CARE MEMBERSHIP WHO ARE EXPECTED TO BE GRANDFATHERED INTO THE ECM. IT'S ALREADY TAKES. 52% OF OUR MEDIC HEALTH POPULATION. WHY THAN THE ONE ANTICIPATED. WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDING HAPPENS SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF THE INTENSIVE SERVICES EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE INVESTMENTS REQUIRED BY NOT ONLY ARE PROVIDERS THAT OFFER THE PLAN- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE LA CARE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER A ONE TIME START UP GRANTS TO SOME OF OUR TV CANDY. BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE PLANT WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO GET THE THIRD PROVIDERS READY FOR THE TRANSITION TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER READING THAT'S NOT ONLY BRING THAT NEW PROVIDERS BUT ALSO CHANGES AND READY ENOUGH ACTIVITIES FOR EXISTING THE VIETNAMESE AS WELL AS EXISTING WHOLE PERSON CARE PROVIDERS THAT WILL HAVE TO ADAPT TO NEW REQUIREMENTS. UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO HEAR. JERRY THIS INCOME ABOUT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. SO WE CAN I DON'T. HOW TO BUY SUPPORT BEDIENEN- OUR PROVIDE NETWORK. WE ALSO ASKED THAT DHS WORK TWO MINUTE THE ADMINISTRATIVE. WITH REAL UNDER HEALTH HOMES AND I OFTEN HEARD ANYTHING AT ME TELLING ME THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE CHOICES BETWEEN HIRING ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OUR CLINICAL STAFF WHO WOULD BE WORKING TWO THIRDS MEMBER CARE- ADDITIONALLY WE NEED INFORMATION ON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED CLARITY ON SO THAT WE CAN WORK TO HELP PROVIDE I REDDING AFFECTED WE NEED TO OUR PROVIDERS ESTABLISHED OUR INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNALLY AND ONLINE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- DOING WHAT IS. NECESSARY FOR DH YEAH. ADDITIONALLY WE ASK FORTY EIGHT YES YOU CONSIDER. OFFERING REFINEMENT ON ECM TARGET POPULATION. I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ARE SEVEN TARGET POPULATIONS THAT THE EXISTING CRITERIA ARE EXTREMELY BROAD. THIS POSES ANOTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGE WHEN YOU'RE IN A COUNTY LIKE LOS ANGELES THIRD BY SIX DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS. WHEN SIX DIFFERENT HEALTH PLANS HAVE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CRITERIA YET THEY SHARE MULTIPLE PROVIDERS THIS CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED. IN THE I'VE HEARD OF- STREAMLINING PROPERTIES AND MINIMIZING I'M ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WE ASK FOR CONSISTENT CRITERIA. THAT CAN BE APPLIED BY ALL PLAN. IT ON MY COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT ON ITS VISION AND A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT OUR MOST AT RISK MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISS OF ALLAH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LINDA WAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN LED THE WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE AGREE WITH THE AIM TO BE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT BUT REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF PLANTED THE LADY TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES GIVEN THEIR TRACK RECORD. ON REQUIRED CONVENTION MEDICAL SERVICES AND CLEANING IT CLANCY NOT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE THE REQUIRED MEDICAL SERVICES THE AREA IN WHICH THEY ARE EXPERTS HOW CAN YOU BE EXPECTED TO ENGAGE IN CASE MANAGEMENT AND LINKAGE TO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE NO EXPERTISE THAT. RENDON HAD CARE NOW. IS BOTH ON REFERRALS RATHER THAN THE DELIVERY MEDICAL SERVICES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PLAN TO PARTNER WITH TRUSTED COMMUNITY PROVIDER. WE APPRECIATE IT HAS CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDERS INCLUDE ORGANIZATION SERVING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS I RECOMMEND THERE BE SPECIAL EFFORT TO PARTNER WITH SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT HAVE STRONG TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CARE. PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT ONLY HAVE EXPERIENCE SERVING THE POPULATION BUT IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE SUCCESSFULLY OFFERING THE SERVICES TO THAT POPULATION. IT'S STILL UNDER. HOW THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WILL SERVE POPULATION WHO ALREADY RECEIPT CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUCH AS CHILDREN ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SERVICES REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS AND INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN. HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER PROGRAM. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE THE PLANS ON WHAT BASIC AND COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT- DOESN'T HAVE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE EXPECTED FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS SHORTLY. WE RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT CLARIFYING THESE DOCUMENTS HOW MEMBERS WILL MOVE BETWEEN THESE CASE MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AT THEIR NEEDS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL EVALUATE THE TRANSITION. THIS GUIDANCE SHOULD ALSO BE SPECIFIC TO EACH TARGET GROUP TO RECOGNIZE EACH POPULATION HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ARE INVOLVED WITH DIFFERENT HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE. JUST DONE FOR BOTH THE HANDS CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT AND THE PROPOSED IN LIEU OF SERVICE ELIGIBILITY FOR HELPING SUPPORT SERVICES. WE RECOMMEND STRIKING AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AS AN ELIGIBILITY CRITERION AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEFINE IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND ALLOWING FOR CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFICIARIES ONCE THEY'RE NO LONGER HOMELESS BY ADDING BENEFICIARY WHO PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS. THAT ARE NOT. OURS CITING IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. AND FINALLY IN CARE MANAGEMENT AVAILABLE OR DO. X. FOR THOSE IN REAL IN THE MANY CONNECT. SO WE RECKON ADDING LANGUAGE THAT RECORD THESE DEALS WILL BECOME A- ONE THIRTY. AND THANK YOU. THINKING THIS WAY NEXT WE WILL FROM COOLEY WALLACE. HI MY NAME IS JULIA WALLACE AND I AM A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WITH ACCOUNT LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM AND I'M ALSO PROUD MEMBER OF S. P. ARE YOU LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY ONE. I HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS WORKING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM AND I CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY TO ELEVATE SDSU'S POSITION REQUIRING MANAGED CARE. PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH IN THE COUNTY SYSTEM PROVIDERS OF CRITICAL HEALTHCARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND ALSO SPECIFICALLY MY WORK OUR IS LOCATED WITHIN THE SERVICE PLANNING AREA FOR REGION WHICH INCLUDES SKID ROW. HOLLYWOOD CAREER TOWN OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES MADE CITY MANY OTHER PLACES SO REALLY AND MY OFFICES ARE ON SKID ROW SO GROUND ZERO FOR A LOT OF THE HOMELESSNESS AND FOLKS LIVING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES- THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT I WORK WITH IN PARTICULAR. I'M HERE TO SHARE SOME OF MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES AND TO ADVOCATE FOR THE SERVICES TO BE WITHIN THE COUNTY ALONG WITH MY UNDERSTANDINGS OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. FROM MY EXPERIENCE. IN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY FOLKS ARE I'VE HEARD SOME SPEAKERS TALKING ABOUT. TRAINING AND CONTINUATION OF KERR AS A COUNTY WORKER I HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED THE CONTINUATION OF CARE AND SERVICES WITH IN THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH IN PARTICULAR THAT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO ASSIST MY CLIENTS AND ALSO TO. HELP GET MY CLIENTS PERMANENT HOUSING AND HAVE OTHER POSITIVE OUTCOMES. I WOULD SEE THAT A LOT OF COUNTY PROVIDERS ARE OFTEN VIEWED AS- ONE SONG OR INVISIBLE HEROES BUT ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC I THINK FOLKS ARE MORE ARE REALIZING THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. AND HOW IMPORTANT CONTINUUM CONTINUUM OF CARE I FOR FOLKS THAT OFTENTIMES EITHER LOSE ARE OFTEN DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE WORKING WITH FOLKS AND BEING ABLE TO LOCATE THEM. OUR WAR IN WITHIN THE EITHER THE JAIL OR COUNTY HOSPITAL OR EVEN PRIVATE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HAS ALSO HELPED US BE ABLE TO MAIN CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR OUR CLIENTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE I WORK WITH FOLKS WERE HOW YOU REALIE THERE'S OF- PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS SO SOMETIMES WHEN I. HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MY CLIENTS WHEN  WORKED IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I WOULD JUST EITHER HOPE THAT I CAN LOCATE THEM- ARE YOU SOME OF THE PUBLIC FACILITIES PUBLIC DATABASES TO BE ABLE TO FIND THEM. BUT WITHIN THE COUNTY- I HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING CALLED IBIS WHICH IS A FACILITY- DATABASE THAT TRACKS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THE BECAUSE OF ALSO HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROVIDERS THAT ARE WORKING IN THESE HOSPITALS. I'M ABLE TO LOCATE MY CLIENT SPEAK WITH HIM DMH LIAISONS ARE WORKING WITHIN THE HOSPITALS. AND ASSIST WITH YOUR CHARGE PLANNING WITH EITHER SHORT TERM HOUSING OR GETTING THEM INTO A CRISIS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND WORKING WITH LONG TERM HOUSING. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH FOLKS AND GETTING THEM SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE. HEALTH ASSISTING THEM IN COMPLETING NO. AS THEN ARE CLIENTS WE'RE GETTING PERMANENT IT'S MIKE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CURRENTLY HAVE PERMANENT WHO WERE HOMELESS. FOR TWENTY YEAR OR- I'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO- WORK WITH CLIENTS WHO. HAVE HAD- ACTIVE WERE ACTIVELY PSYCHOTIC AND NEEDED ACUTE CARE AND BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE OTHER SOCIAL WORKERS AND FOLKS WITHIN THE HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THEM SERVICES AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF BEING A COUNTY WORKER AND HAVING ACCESS TO THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT I DIDN'T REALLY NECESSARILY HAVE. OUR WHEN I WORKED WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DON'T NECESSARILY CURRENTLY HAVE- I THINK REQUIRING MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS WITH THE CONTRACT WITH COUNTY PROVIDERS. WOULD BENEFIT FOLKS BECAUSE OF THE ROBUST NETWORK THAT WE ALREADY HAVE- AND BENEFIT OUR CLIENTS I'M REALLY REALLY PROUD AND EXCITED THAT I WAS ABLE AND THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITHIN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE. PILOT PROGRAM AND OUR TO SEE THIS IT REALLY HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND- I CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES AS A COUNTY WORKER AND ALSO SOMEONE WHO'S HAD. YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS HOMELESSNESS HIV POSITIVE IMMIGRANTS LGBTQ FOLKS WOMEN AND CUT PEOPLE WITH CO OCCURRING DISORDERS- AND I DO THINK THAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR COUNTY EMPLOYEES. WHO ALREADY HAVE THIS NETWORK AND EXPANDING THE NETWORK OF COUNTY EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS INCREDIBLE WORKED WITH THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL A LOT OF COUNTY WORKERS ARE ALREADY DOING. AND PEOPLE THE COUNCIL'S FOR LISTENING TO MY REMARKS WHATEVER I CAN DO TODAY GIVE INFORMATION OR INSIGHT FROM MY EXPERIENCES I LOVE TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM FAREHAM MCDADE TEENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M CERTAINLY DATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- THIS AFTERNOON I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MS WALLACE- PRETTY MUCH SAID EVERYTHING I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY SAID ABOUT THE EXPERTISE OF COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH OF COUNTIES FOR DEALING WITH THESE HIGH RISK HIGH NEED CLIENTS WHAT I'D LIKE TO GO OVER TODAY IS TO BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE CM WHICH WE RECOGNIZE. THE RISKS AND SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS- FIRST FOR OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY UNDER CALTRAIN TO IMPLEMENT HIGH LEVEL CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES- IS UNPRECEDENTED AND WE APPLAUD AND THANK THE DEPARTMENTS- THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING IT AND ALSO. FOR TAKING THE BATON BACK UP AFTER WE ALL GOT DISTRACTED BY COLLUDED NINETEEN- NOW MORE THAN EVER WE THINK THAT- HIGH LEVEL CASE MANAGEMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR THE POPULATION THAT OFTEN GETS LEFT BEHIND- OFFERING THESE SERVICES- THE ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT ECM SERVICES STATEWIDE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. AS WELL AS BRINGING IN THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WOULD COME WITH IT FOR THESE COMPLEX CASES THOSE ARE THE REALLY THE DRIVING GOALS BEHIND OFFERING ECM- AND COUNTIES ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE OUT WE ALSO APPRECIATE- THE OPPORTUNITY TO STILL ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUATION OF NON DUPLICATIVE COUNTY TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. MS COOPER MENTIONED THAT EARLIER AND YOU KNOW OUR PROBATION SIDE OF THINGS ARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE IN A PUBLIC ON SIDE WE STILL DO USE TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES SO WE'RE WE SHOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS COURTNEY. POTENTIALLY WITH. A NEW ECM CASE MANAGER. I LIKE TO GET INTO THE RISK. THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO KNOW- WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A DISJOINTED TRANSITION FOR WHOLE PERSON CARE CLIENTS TO A MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. INCLUDING SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DETAILS- THE ABILITY AS MS WELL AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY- TO REACH THESE CLIENTS- OFTEN YOU CANNOT REACH THEM WITH A CELLPHONE. AND CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH A COMPUTER OR PERSONAL COMPUTER INTERFACE- WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT- HAS TAKEN IN STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON THE NEED FOR ACTIVE AND SUSTAINED OUTREACH. TO THESE BENEFICIARIES- WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE- YOU KNOW DETAILS ABOUT HOW THAT WOULD BE% UNDERTAKEN BY THE HEALTH CARE PLANS- WHICH BRINGS ME ON TO MY NEXT POINT WHICH IS- WE'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT REDUCED ACCESS TO LOCAL MULTI DISCIPLINARY AT EFFORTS. ESPECIALLY THE CLOSE COOPERATION. THAT MANY WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS HAVE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- THE NEXT PANELIST MISS WORLD HOME WILL COVER THAT IN MORE DETAIL. AND THEN LASTLY THE RELIANCE ON- THROUGH ECM WITH A MANAGED CARE PLAN ON A MEDICAL MODEL. RATHER THAN A COMMUNITY BASED SOCIAL MODEL. COOL PERSON CARE AND OTHER HOMELESS OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE DOING- AND I MENTION HOMELESS OUTREACH PROGRAMS AS A BROAD UMBRELLA OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE OUNTY'S. OFFER OF. WE COUNTY ARE RESERVOIR OF EXPERTISE. IN THE FOR OF FOLKS LIKE MS WALLACE. WORKERS HEALTH CRISIS TEAMS AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND ALL OF THESE WORKERS- UNDERSTAND THEY RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEX SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS. AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF GEOGRAPHY AND SYSTEMIC RACISM. AMONG ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES AND WE CANNOT LOSE THIS LEVEL OF EXPERTISE TEASE OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT AND COMMITMENT TO SERVING THESE PEOPLE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECM. THE COUPLE'S SHORT SOLUTIONS TO OFFER INCLUDING WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED SHORT PHASING IN PERIOD FOR ECM I WAS DONE WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WE APPRECIATE THEIR ATTENTION TO THAT INPUT TO ALLOW A PHASED IN APPROACH. THIS STATE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER ALLOWING REGIONAL MODELS WHICH I RECOGNIZE IS COVERED IN ANOTHER PART OF THIS HEARING BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO BOTH OF THE SALMON AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES AS THEIR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SPECIALIZED AND TAILORED SERVICES. DESIGNED TO BE COMPLEX NEEDS AND THOSE SERVICES LIKE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES MAY NOT ALWAYS BE RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN ACCOUNTING- THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT SOLUTION FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WILL NOT. COME AS A SURPRISE TO BOTH- YOU AT CHAIR WOULD AND YOU WOULD CHAIR EVER TO BE A LOT OF NEWS TO SHARE COOPER MENTIONED EARLIER THAT PLANS ARE ENCOURAGED CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES THAT THEY RECOMMEND THEY CONTACT WITH CANNONS- BUT THERE'S NOT A. THE FIRM REQUIREMENT TO DO SO. I WE BELIEVE IT WILL EASIER REQUIRES INTENSIVE COOPER INCOME. OF THE LOCAL. AND ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BY THE STATE WITHOUT THIS INTENSIVE COOPERATION AND COMMUNICATION BEGINNING RIGHT NOW WITH- COUNTIES AND HOPEFULLY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. BEGINNING CONVERSATIONS BUT ALSO ROBUST TECHNICAL SUPPORT. UCM WILL FAIL AND SO WE SUGGEST THAT IT IS REQUIRED- TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND- THAT. THE EXPERTISE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COUNTY SPECIFICALLY BUT THEY'RE ALSO VERY VALUABLE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. IS NOT LOST IN THE TRANSITION TO ECM. COUNTY STAND READY TO ENSURE COORDINATED PATIENT CENTERED ECM SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AND WE THANK THE CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM PAULO WILL HOME DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE COUNTY- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON SHARES WOULD AND ARAMBULA- AGAIN MY NAME IS PAULA WILL HOME I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS PERSPECTIVE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES OPERATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS THAT COVER SPECIALTY SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USED. CAN YOU MAY RURAL HEALTH PLAN SUPPORT THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL AS A WHOLE OUR MEMBERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BILL MUST BE ADDRESSED TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ECM FOR PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. SPECIFICALLY WE FELL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS NOT FULLY ANSWERED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROPOSED ECM BENEFIT AND SIMILAR CARE MANAGEMENT AND WRAPAROUND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED AND FUNDED BY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN. WE WORRY ABOUT POTENTIAL SERVICE DUPLICATION AND NEW LAYERS OF CONFUSION FOR CLIENTS. THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT DH CS OR INDIVIDUAL MANAGED CARE PLANS MAY ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ECM BETTER TO NARROW- AND MAY NOT INCLUDE MANY OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF PREMATURE MORTALITY. I AM WE APPRECIATE THE DH CS HAS OFFERED A COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK- AS THE POLICY WAS DEVELOPED AND WE HAVE OFFERED SOME SPECIFIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. FIRST WE SUGGEST THAT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ECM SHOULD BE REFINED TO PRIORITIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CAN EXPERIENCE EXTREMELY HIGH RISK FOR PREMATURE. MORTALITY STRICTLY DUE TO THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU H. C. S. REQUIRE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS TO BE KNOWN TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AS A CONDITION OF ENROLLMENT OR ELIGIBILITY FOR ECM. AND THIS IS IN EQUITY AND DISPARITIES ISSUE NATIONALLY IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES. MOST NOTABLY PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS HOW EXPECTANCY THAT IS SEVEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS LOWER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO PHYSICAL HEALTH COMORBIDITIES LIKE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES THAT GO UNTREATED DUE TO POOR ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND OFTEN LINKED TO STIGMA AND BIAS THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ACCESS SERVICES IN THE TRADITIONAL CLINIC SETTING. WE BELIEVE ONE Q. GOAL OF A STRATEGY LIKE YOU SEE ECM SHOULD BE TO IMPROVE CONNECTIONS TO PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR CLIENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATES. ACCESS ENHANCED CARE COORDINATION AND WRAPAROUND GOAL PERSON PARTS. THEREFORE WE URGE DH CS TO HELP MANAGED CARE PLANS IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES LIKE ECM THAT CAN HELP IDENTIFY THE PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS. OF OUR HIGH RISK BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WE'VE BEEN TO BECOME COSTLY HI UTILIZED EARNERS OF EMERGENCY OR INPATIENT SERVICES. OUR SECOND OVER ARCHING POLICY RECOMMENDATION SIMILAR TO WHAT- MS MCDADE KING JUST MENTIONED IS THAT DH CS SHOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO COLLABORATE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS. TO FIRST. I'M SHARED BENEFICIARIES AND THEN IMPLEMENT ECM PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGHLY COORDINATED MANAGED CARE PLANS SHOULD ALSO BE EXPECTED TO PURSUE CONTRACTS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE ECM FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLIENTS UNLESS SPECIFIED EXCEPTION CRITERIA APPLY. COLLABORATIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY OFFER AND PAY FOR SOME SERVICES THAT RESEMBLE CORE COMPONENTS OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT OR EVEN THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES DICUSSED. IT'S PAST. HE'S COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MAY INCLUDE CASE MANAGEMENT BUT SOMETIMES ADDRESSES PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADDITION TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SOME OF OUR COUNTY BASED SERVICES ARE REIMBURSED UNDER MEDICARE I'LL AND IN OTHER CASES. WE OFFER ECM LIKE SERVICES THAT FOR OUT OF MEDIC HOW BY IMAGE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I OR A LOCAL DOLLARS. I'M ALSO WENT TO. MR IS COMMON BUT DH CS CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS AND- BETWEEN. THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND THEN WE WILL SERVE PROPOSALS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND AS THE POLICY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE B. H. DA HAS BEEN TO THAT NEARLY ENCOURAGE MANNER CARE FOR TO WORK WITH CAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAN. MAY NOT CREATE STRONG ENOUGH GUARDRAILS TO AVOID POTENTIAL DUPLICATION OF SERVICES OR ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING ARTICLE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER ECM. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PAYING FOR SERVICES THAT CAN BE COVERED UNDER MEDI CAL- WITH OTHER FUNDING SOURCES INSTEAD WE ARE ASKING DH THE S. TO CONTINUE DEVELOP. STRONGER AND MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE IN THIS AREA TO CARILLO WHAT IS BEEN PUT FORWARD FOR SOME OF OUR OTHER. COUNTY BASED PARTNERS. AND MEDICAL SERVICE TECHS. IN CONCLUSION COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS REALLY HOPE TO PARTNER WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS TO IMPLEMENT A HIGHLY COORDINATED ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THAT SUPPLEMENTS ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND DOES NOT DUPLICATE OR REPLACE THEM. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT STRONGER GUIDANCE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE WE MAXIMISE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT ACROSS OUR MEDIC HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND INCLUDE OUR HIGHEST REST HERO HEALTH CLIENTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND MANAGED CARE PLANS ON THE PROPOSED ECM BENEFIT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START ITS TOP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL I WILL NOW- PAUSE FOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS. MEMBERS. DR WHAT IS FOR THEN I WILL ASK THE QUESTION IF I CAN- ITSELF THE DEPARTMENT TIGHT REALLY- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMMENT ABOUT THE CONCERNS REGARDING TRANSITION. AND WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT WHAT THAT TRANSITION HOW YOU COULD ALLAY SOME OF THOSE FEARS. SO ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE KALANK PROPOSAL FOR THE TRANSITION OF WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP HOMES. IS THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED- TO CONTRACT WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP FROM PROVIDERS- TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES BOTH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. AS WELL AS THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED WITHIN CALLING RIGHT TO CONTINUE AND THERE IS A VERY SHORT LIST OF EXCEPTIONS- TO. WIN THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN INCLUDING IF A I COUNTY OPT OUT OF PROVIDING WHOLE PERSON CARE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE OR THE ECM IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AND SO THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE INDIVIDUALS THAT SPOKE EARLIER REGARDING THEIR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT WE ARE MANDATING WITHIN. THE PROPOSAL ALREADY TODAY THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACTS WITH THOSE ENTITIES TO CONTINUE THOSE-SERVICES- UNLESS THEY OTHERWISE CANNOT REACH AGREEMENT UP FOR THOSE SERVICES- AND SO THAT'S HOW WE'RE HANDLING THE TRANSITION OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP HOMES PROGRAMS- WITHIN THE PROPOSAL ITSELF. YOU CAN USE TO THE TIMELINE- WE HEARD FROM MEMORIES OF ALL OF. THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH HOMES PROGRAMS FOR LA CARE. THAT IT WAS AMBITIOUS AND WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD- COMMENT ON THAT. SHARP SO- FOR ANYWHERE WHERE WE HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE OR HEALTH HOMES WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THOSE COMPONENTS GO LIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THAT IS A HARD DATE THAT WE MUST KEEP. JUST TO BE CLEAR- WITH THE ENDING OF OUR CURRENT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER- IF WE DID NOT ALLOW FOR THAT TRANSITION WE WOULD HAVE A CLIFF- IN IN FORTUNATE CLASS FOUR ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS COUNTY PARTNERS. YOU PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TODAY THROUGH THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE PATHWAY OF FOR THOSE SERVICES BOTH FOR THE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES. BUT ALSO FOR THE COUNTIES IN PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS PROVIDING THOSE CRITICAL SERVICES TODAY- AND SO WE ARE REQUIRING ALL OF THOSE TRANSITIONS HAPPEN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWO TWO. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- WE WERE VERY OPEN TO THE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IN REGARDS TO A PHASED IMPLEMENTATION THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS FOR. THE OTHER NON WHOLE PERSON CARE HEALTH HOME POPULATIONS TO COME UP ON A TWO OTHER CRITICAL TIME PERIODS SO I'M JULY ONE OF TWENTY. TWO ON IN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY THREE- ARE THE OTHER TWO DATES IN WHICH THEY CAN BRING THEM UP MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD BE ABLE TO PROPOSED TO US- WHICH TARGET POPULATIONS THEY'RE BRINGING UP. ON THOSE OTHER DATES ALLOWING THEM TO WHERE THEY HAVE A CONTRACT OR NEGOTIATIONS IN PLACE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES GO UP SOONER WHERE THEY ARE DEVELOPING- THAT THOSE NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS STILL UP TO HAVE THE LATER DATES ABOUT IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO KIND OF. HEALER ASSEMBLY APPROACH THAT WE DID BOTH HEALTH HOMES AND WHOLE PERSON CARE AS WAS MENTIONED OF INDIAN SUCCESSFUL THROUGH. BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS. HI I WILL- IN MY- QUESTION OR COMMENTS THE NEW- BUT DO WANT TO ASK WHAT PAUL WILL HEADS. ABOUT THERE BEING A POTENTIAL FOR SERVER SERVICE DUPLICATION. SINCE I BROUGHT IT UP IN THE FIRST PANEL I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO MENTION IT AGAIN HERE IN THE SECOND PANEL. AND IT REALLY WILL REQUIRE COORDINATION AMONGST MANY OF THE- ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THIS PANEL TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T DUPLICATE THOSE SERVICES. IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN. PATIENTS WHO THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WILL SERVE AS WELL AS- THOSE WHO WILL RECEIVE THE ECM. AND JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMPLEMENTING AND NOT DUPLICATING SERVICES. WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS PANEL WILL MOVE ON THE PANEL THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR REGULAR OUR THIRD PANEL WILL LOOK AS A REQUIREMENT FOR INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO BE PAID TO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE WITNESSES ARE- J. C. COOPER ONCE AGAIN- FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SIR FOR A HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BEN JOHNSON PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DR KAREN HANS BERGER- CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN AND LINDA WAY. FROM THE POLICY ADVOCATE FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY SO. TO YOU MISS COOPER. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO WHAT I WANT TO START WITH WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING- INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- TODAY SO I'M CURRENTLY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ROLLED OUT AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THROUGH PROP FIFTY SIX- THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM- THAT IS CURRENTLY FUNDED UNDER. THE SAME TYPE OF FUNDING MECHANISM OF THE 5% WITHIN A CAPITATION RATE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THE- TELLING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO BE PROVIDED. I'M ESSENTIALLY IT PROVIDES INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR ACHIEVING- SPECIFIED MILESTONES IN MEASURES- AND THEN WE PAY A BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF COMPLETING THOSE ON THOSE INCENTIVES- AND SO THAT IS JUST AN EXAMPLE- WHERE WE WHERE WE PROVIDE THAT TODAY. UNDER THE CALLIN PROPOSAL WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO DO IS ESTABLISH- PLAN INCENTIVES THAT WOULD REALLY DRIVE TOO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY- THE DEPARTMENT THINGS THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL ESPECIALLY FOR AREAS THAT CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE. A THESE SERVICES IN LIEU OF AND ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT FOR THEM TO BE STATEWIDE- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON SOME INVESTMENTS TO GET US THERE ARE BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF BEING PROVIDED WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SUSTAINABLE- FUNDING SOURCE FOR THOSE. SERVICES INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS AT YOUR DRAW DOWN AND NOT SUBJECT TO LOCAL ALLOCATIONS ARE DOLLARS BEING INVESTED INTO THEM- AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO IS INCENTIVIZE THAT BUILD ON BOTH FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT MODELS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE IN LIEU OF- SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE SAID HE'S INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE GET THE CAPACITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE TRAINING THAT I TO OUT TO INDIVIDUALS AS MENTIONED EARLIER. ONE OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS THAT THAT ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES- THAT INCLUDES THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS THE SO MITCHELL ASPECTS OF THAT SERVICE. I'M IN THERE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE NEED PROVIDE EVEN SO DOLLAR WILL HELP WITH SOME OF THAT TRAINING. BEST PRACTICES ETCETERA. I WILL ALSO FOCUS ON- PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS- AND QUALITY OUTCOMES WHERE WE CAN SEE DRIVERS. INCENTIVIZE PLANS TO INCREASE THE USE OF A LOT OF SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE IMPORTANT TO DO TO EVENTUALLY GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE COULD POTENTIALLY OFFER SOME OF THESE ADS MEDICARE BENEFITS VERSUS JUST THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES PATH. I'M SO CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THESE DOLLARS- I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD. IT BESIDES THAT THEY CAN PAY FOR I'M VERY S. I. T. WORKFORCE TRAINING AND OTHER PIECES AND I'LL GO THROUGH A LIST LATER IN REGARDS TO YOU SOME OF THOSE PIECES. I WE DO PLAN ON HAVING AND I'M CONDUCTING ROBUST STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK I'M HOPING THAT- IN EARLY SUMMER WILL HAVE SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE TO REVIEW AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION OUT EARLY TO MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS ALSO THE UNDERSTAND THE IN TYPES OF INCENTIVES THAT WE WILL BE OFFERING THROUGH THE CALENDAR POSTAL- WE DO PROPOSED THAT- MILESTONES COULD BE MET IN DOLLARS CAN FLOW AS SOON AS JANUARY OF. ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M AND- BEING ABLE TO TRIGGER THOSE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR EXAMPLE- AND ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT. THAT IS OUR TARGET POPULATION AIMED FOR MAYBE A JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY THREE TIMELINE- SO WE DO KNOW THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR OUR PLAN INTERPRETERS WHO ARE WANTING TO YOU- EXECUTE THAT- SOME EXAMPLES. OF THINGS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED- DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE PAYMENTS INCLUDE. I WORKFORCE TRAINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUR REGULAR DATA SHARING BETWEEN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BARRIERS THAT THEY MAY HAVE ARE BEING REMOVED. SO THAT THEY CAN BEAT PROVIDERS ON IN THIS PROGRAM. AT GAP NEEDS IS. SO BAD UNDER. AT THEIR IS- ANY. OUT THERE WHO THESE SERVICES. DOING THAT GAP ANALYSIS ON THE GROUND TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN CLOSE THOSE GAPS WITH ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES- OR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS. AS WELL AS CAPACITY BUILDING ON SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING A TRANSITION PLANS LIKE INCLUDING- AND ENSURING THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE AT THE TABLE. TO PROVIDE SOME OF THESE CRITICAL SERVICES WHEN THEY'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THINGS LIKE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND WHAT COMES WITH THAT OF COURSE- THE DISSEMINATION OF BEST PRACTICES. AS WELL AS MEETING VARIOUS OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES- AND YOU KNOW ACROSS ACCESS QUALITY OUTCOMES. AS WELL AS EQUITY- SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY FOCUSED ON IN SOME OF OUR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE DOLLARS THAT WILL BE COMING OUT. I'M SO I THINK HOSE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING- AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE IN REGARDS TO THOSE INCENTIVES. I THINK A BROAD LEVY INCENTIVES WILL BE PAID- ON THE MANAGED CARE PLANS BASED ON THE MILESTONES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN JUST FLAGGING FOR PEOPLE UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE ARE REQUIRED THAT WE CANNOT GO. YOU KNOW YOU SEE THAT 5% OF THEIR CAPITATION PAYMENTS SO WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING THAT. THROUGH THIS PROCESS AS WELL. AND THEN ON THE LAST QUESTION I REQUESTED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE WE ADDRESS AROUND SHARED SAVINGS NO FEDERAL REGULATIONS DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE UTILIZATION AND ACTUAL COST OF. IN LIEU OF SERVICES WHEN DEVELOPING CAPITATION RATES- AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ALREADY HAVE AN INHERENT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE- TO PROVIDE AUTHORIZED IN LIEU OF SERVICES VERSUS THE MORE COSTLY STATE PLAN SERVICES. REGARDLESS OF THAT RATE METHODOLOGY THAT'S OUTLINED THAT'S ONE OF THE INHERENT REASONS WHY WE REALLY HOPE AND ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. I'M TO IMPLEMENT THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES BECAUSE BY NATURE OF THEM BEING APPROVED THEY ARE LESS COSTLY THAN STATE PLAN SERVICES THAT ARE OTHERWISE. A POTENTIALLY BEING UTILIZED BY THAT BENEFICIARY. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO FULLY ENGAGE IN THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A BOTH LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AROUND A LOT OF THOSE HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. I MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL AS THE CLINICALLY LINKED- HOUSING CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT DID PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT A SHARED SAVINGS RISK MODEL THAT WOULD BEGIN IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE- AND THE SHARED SAVES RISK MODELING IS BROADER THAN JUST A LOVE SERVICES WE'RE REALLY. TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE THE INVESTMENT IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS CARE COORDINATION IN LIEU OF SERVICES- THAT YOU KNOW REALLY LOOKING AT HOW YOU CAN REDUCE THE OVERALL COST. BUT REALLY IMPROVING THE BENEFICIARIES HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THEN MEASURING IT- SO THAT'S WHERE WE WILL FOCUS THAT A FURTHER DETAIL ARE STILL. THE AND RICK TO THAT. A SAVINGS RISK MY- BUT LOOK FORWARD TO IN. THE OUT WITH WITH. INDIVIDUALS AS THOSE DETAILS COME AVAILABLE AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ONE BEN JOHNSON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND- WELL BOTH CHAIRS UP AND JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- TO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES OUT ULTIMATELY OVER TWO POINT FIVE YEARS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS- FOR THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DIRECTOR COOPER- JUST DESCRIBED LARGELY AROUND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN AN LIVE SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PAYMENTS OUT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR ONE SUSTAINING THE EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS- THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT CALTRAIN WOULD BUILD UPON A REPLACE THAT SELL EXISTING IN THIS SERVICE LEVELS THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH HEALTH HOMES AND WHOLE PERSON CARE THAT WOULD BILL SUNSET- NEXT YEAR AS CAL AIMED. IMPLEMENTS AND IN ADDITION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CENTER FUNDING AS WELL FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO REALLY BUILD OUT THE FULL SET OF EYELASH SERVICES- THAT THIS THAT THE STATE- POTENTIALLY HOPES FOR THEM TO PROVIDE UNDER CALLING. WHATEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND THE LACK OF DETAIL- WITH THIS PROPOSAL- TO DATE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS NOT PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF WHAT PLAN ACTIVITIES WOULD TRIGGER A PAYMENT DETAIL ON HOW MUCH FUNDING WOULD. BE PROVIDED FOR EACH ACTIVITY OR HOW THE PROGRAM RULES WOULDN'T SCHERER WHERE APPROPRIATE THAT THAT CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED UNDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOMES ARE SUBSTANDARD- AND AS DIRECTOR COOPER NOTED- THEY DO PLAN TO RELEASE- SORT OF A BROAD DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR INTENTION IS FOR THAT NOT TO COME OUT UNTIL THE EARLY SUMMER AND THIS MAY NOT GIVE THE LEGISLATOR ADEQUATE TIME TO SCRUTINIZE THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL PRIOR TO DECIDING. ON WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THE FUNDING. R. N. ADDITION DO QUITE WHETHER THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING RELATED TO INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. IS REALISTIC THE GOVERNOR'S AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDING PLAN- WOULD HAVE THE FUNDING SUNSET AFTER TWO POINT FIVE YEARS- BUT WE FIND THIS QUESTIONABLE FOR THE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS FIRST IT'S THAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE FUNDED BASED. ON THEIR PRIOR COST EXPERIENCE AND SO THE ANSWER FUND IS ALL TO. YOU ON. AND FOR EXAMPLE I LOW WESTERN. WHOSE COSTS ARE. THEN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN. LIKE WOULD INCREASE **** TO COVER THE HIGH RIPPLE CALL. THIS IS NOT A- FOR IN THE- MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN UNDER CALLAN. ALTERNATIVELY EVEN IF THE FUNDING DOES NOT END UP COVERING SUCH REIMBURSABLE COSTS THERE COULD BE PRESSURE TO RE AUTHORIZE THIS FUNDING TO SUSTAIN THE SERVICES BUT THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WOULD SUPPORT. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT SAVINGS FROM IMPROVED COST EFFECTIVENESS OF- THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES UNDER CALLIN COULD SUSTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR PROVIDING ECM ARE INTENSE CARE MANAGEMENT AND LOW SERVICES. WE QUESTION WHETHER THIS ASSUMPTION IS REALISTIC PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM AS SUCH SAVINGS COULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO MATERIALIZE. SO IN SOME WE DO HAVE- QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE LACK OF DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL AND ABOUT THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN- RELATED THERE TOO WE ALSO- HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THAT WE RAISED IN A PREVIOUS ANALYSIS RELATED TO- THE LACK OF DETAIL ON THE SHARED RISK SHARE SAVINGS COMPONENTS. BUT REALLY JUST THEM I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR MORE DETAIL BEFORE WE CAN ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THAT COMPONENT. OF THE CALLIN PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR HANS BERGER. A GOOD AFTERNOON ON MY H. P. APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS NEEDED TO INCENTIVIZE FOUNDATIONAL INVESTMENTS NEEDED UP FRONT TO SUPPORT THE HIRING AND THE BUILDING OUT AS NEEDED CLINICAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. AS ILLUSTRATED BY MY EARLIER COMMENTS A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. GIVEN THE INCENTIVE PAPER PROGRAM IS TIME LIMITED AND CONSIDERING THE EXTENSIVE WORK NEEDED TO BUILD A FOUNDATION FOR A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH AND SUSTAINMENT FOR BILO S. PROPOSAL. I H. P. SUPPORT AND INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW US THE FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF PROVIDER NETWORKS DEVELOP NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVEST IN DATA SHARING. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING UP THE PROGRAM FOR THE GREATER POSSIBILITY OF SIX THAT. WE BELIEVE THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM SHOULD BOTH MAINTAIN AND EXPAND EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. THIS TYPICALLY. FIRST INCENTIVE PAYMENT FUNDING SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL INVESTMENT TO INCLUDE PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTING OF IOWA SERVICES IN MANY CASES THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR START UP COSTS ARE NEEDED FOR SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE DO NOT HAVE ONE SO BRING CENTER SO THAT WOULD BE A VERY HEAVY LEFT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN. YOUR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. DEFINITELY INCENTIVE FUNDING SHOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND VIOLENCE SERVICES INCLUDING THOSE PROVIDED BY A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. AND THOSE PROVIDED BY I. H. P. TODAY. IN THESE AND MANY CASES THESE SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON A LIMITED BASIS AND REQUIRE FUNDING IN ORDER TO EXPAND TO ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AND EXPANDED MEMBER ELIGIBILITY. LASTLY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE TO BE FOCUSED ON PROCESS ACTIVITIES WHILE THE CAPACITY OF BEING BUILT BUT THE OUTCOME BASED PERFORMANCE MESSAGES AFTER. ONE THIRD COULD PROPERTY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. FOR EXAMPLE THIS COULD BE DONE BY LOOKING AT THE END. THE NUMBER HAS RECRUITED CALRISSIAN OR NUMBER OF MEALS SERVED HOUSING PLACEMENTS THAT ARE FOR THE FOUNDATIONAL SUPPORT OF FINDING. LATER TO BE THEN CHANGED OVER TO. A REDUCTION OF COSTS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THESE NUMBERS BETWEEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU SERVICES TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE TO AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AS BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS IN ORDER TO MEET THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR OUR YEAH ECM LOS MODEL A CARE PLAN DOCUMENT. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE PLAN UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM STRUCTURE WILL BE. WE NEED THIS FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING TO GET THE PLAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROPERLY NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS. AND ACCURATELY PROVIDE THE DETAILS NEEDED TO BE SOLIDLY READY FOR A JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO GO LIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU- MOVING ON NOW TO LINDA AWAY. FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN LINDA WAY THAT WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT ASKED PLAN TO TAKE ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES THE STATE MUST ENSURE PLANS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS NETWORK ADEQUACY TIMELY ACCESS LANGUAGE ACTORS AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THE TIMING OF CALLINAN THE RECURRENT SCHEDULE ALIGN WELL TO ENSURE PLAN ARE YOU ABLE TO MEET THESE BASIC STANDARDS AS A CONDITION OF CONTRACTOR KNOW. INSTEAD OF THE MUCH BETTER HEALTH EQUITY AND FOCUS ON ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS FITS INTO THE STATE'S CURRENT MANAGED CARE PLAN QUALITY STRATEGY THE REQUESTED DEPARTMENT ALIGN ITS QUALITY AND HEALTH EQUITY EFFORT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT PLANS WILL RESORT TO KNOW YOUR PRACTICES AND CONTRACT WITH MEDI CAL PROVIDERS AND CLINICS THAT THEY HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE RECOMMENDED INCENTIVES BE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS THE CIVICALLY WITH SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY OFFERED IN HAND CARE MANAGEMENT AND INFLUENCER HI STARTED TO TARGET POPULATION. THIS CAN INCLUDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEM CONTRACT WITH PLANTS RECEIVE REFERRAL INFORMATION. FOR MORE INTEGRATED CARE. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD EXPAND ITS FOR. FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IN AFTER MANAGER AND WITH AT THEIR AND IT TO EXPECT INTO. OF THE NEW POPULAR HEALTH MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE AND QUALITY PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS MORE GENERALLY WHICH WILL BENEFIT THE ENTIRE MEDICARE POPULATION. INCENTIVE PAYMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HOW MANY BENEFICIARIES ARE ACTUALLY CLEAN FOR AND RECEIVING NEEDED SERVICES. RATHER THAN DRIVEN BY REDUCED COST AND UTILIZATION. IT SHOULD ONLY BE PREPARED AND ABLE TO DRIVE BEHAVIOR. I'M NOT BE PROVIDED FOR ACTION PLAN SHOULD ALREADY BE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ACCOMPLISHES GO IT SHOULD ARTICULATE SPECIFIC MEASURABLE TARGETS THANKS OR CALLING AND PLANS WILL BE EXPECTED TO CHEAT AND REPORT ON THE PROGRESS AT LEAST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GOING TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS. AFTER REGULAR. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD- I'M GONNA START TO GET MY QUESTIONS ARE FOR YOU- MISS COOPER- I'M GONNA START WITH WHERE BEN JOHNSON. pDETAIL I WAS- INTRIGUED BY THE MILESTONES REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA TODAY AND YOU PROVIDED SOME DETAILS- REGARDING THOSE MILESTONES IN THE IN TERMS OF WORK FORCE TRAINING GAP ANALYSIS AND CAPACITY BUILDING BUT WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPAND ABOUT WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT COULD MEAN FOR COUNTIES AND CALIFORNIANS. BURKE LET ME GIVE A FEW MORE EXAMPLES- IF THAT'S HELPFUL YOUR- OKAY GREAT SORRY- SO I THINK- THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS FOR EXAMPLE AS WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS I'M SOME OF THAT COULD GO TO DIRECT CAPACITY BUILDING FOR. EXAMPLE RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS BY INCREASING ACCESS TO FIFTEEN NEW RECRUITMENT OF CARE BEDS THERE COULD BE AN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS SO THE IDEA BEHIND INCENTIVES BUT WE WERE BUILDING- IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN A CHEAP IT TO GET THE DOLLARS- IN REALLY DRIVING AROUND BUILDING THAT CAPACITY FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE POINT OF VIEW. SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE PROMOTING BEST PRACTICES AND EXPERTISE FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT- LOW OF SERVICES PROVDERS SO MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT IMPLEMENTED- THE ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS WHERE THEY ARE PROVIDING A ROUTE- YOU KNOW A AROUND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- CARE- KIND OF CORD NATION PIECES AND- BEST PRACTICES OF FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS- PROVIDING TRAINING FOR THOSE BENEFICIARIES POTENTIALLY WOULD BE- ONE FOR PAYMENT- ENCOURAGING. EACH MEANT WITH PROVIDER SO ACTUALLY ADDS JUST MENTIONED BY- MS WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN IN INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN PROVIDERS TO BE OFF THE TABLE ARE PARTICIPATING INCLUDING A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS YOU HAVE. A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS SPACE- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTING WITH THOSE- EXPERTISE OF PROVIDERS DO YOU TO DO THESE SERVICES I THINK ANOTHER ONE WE ARE LOOKING AT IS ENCOURAGING DATA REPORTING AND THE COLLECTION OF THAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. OF FOR THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS MENTIONED EARLIER- AS WELL AS- AND A VARIETY OF KIND OF OUTCOME BASED. MEASURES AND BY THAT I NEED WE ARE LOOKING AT BACK WITH MEASURE THAT WE CAN SEE. AS WELL AS JUST ACTS MEASURE. SO- INCREASES TO U. N. CARE. SERVICES TIME- WELL AS LIEU OF. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SPECIFIC THINGS WERE WE KNOW CERTAIN INTO- FOR EXAMPLE. INDIVIDUALS OF BLACK AND- AMERICAN BENEFITS. ARE AND HIGHER NO OF HOW IN THE AND- CERTAIN MY OF. A TO REDUCE SOME OF THOSE EQUITY GAPS WOULD BE A CRITICAL OF PEACE AS WE'RE BUILDING OUT THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- RE ENTRY FROM THE JAIL POPULATION. THERE'S GOING TO BE- INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY CHALLENGES THEY'RE FINDING THE RIGHT WORKFORCE IN TRAINING THAT WORK FORCE TO DO THOSE. THINGS WHILE ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES- INCENTIVE DOLLARS THERE SO I THINK WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON- ACCENT. STRUCTURE CAPACITY AS WELL AS THOSE OUTCOMES IT'S GOT TO BE A BALANCE OF- SOME OF THE METRICS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BUT AS WELL AS GETTING DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR TO. INCENTIVIZE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CLOSE GAPS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE IN LIEU OF SERVICES TODAY- BUILDING THAT AND WHERE WE ONLY HAVE CAPACITY FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE GROW IN THAT CAPACITY TO MEET THAT NEED. AT THAT GIVEN COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE ONE I DIDN'T HEAR THAT AND- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN IS REGARDING WORKFORCE TRAINING AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT IT. REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. AND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING THE GAP I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT WHETHER THESE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS COULD HELP US TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SURE SO- WORKFORCE AND TRAINING CAN DEFINITELY BE A PART OF THESE INCENTIVE DOLLARS- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR BOTH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND- LUKE SERVICES IS BOTH A COMBINATION OF CLINICAL BUT REALLY NON CLINICAL. A SERVICES WHERE I WE REALLY COULD INCREASE THE WORKFORCE IN THIS SPACE REALLY ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE ON TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES I'M WHETHER THAT'S COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY- BY ONE OF OUR AS SPEAKERS- BUT REALLY GROWING THAT SO YES IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- MAKE SURE IS INCLUDED IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ON OUR LIST- AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE GET THAT WORKFORCE TRAINED AND READY TO. RIDE THIS WORK WE KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITIES OR AREAS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WITH THESE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF THE NON CLINICAL IF THAT'S NEEDED AND JUST GIVEN THE WORKFORCE PRESSURES ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF TODAY AND HEALTH CARE. I THOUGHT IT WAS- PROPRIA ONE WINDOW WAVE UP NETWORK ATTIC. AND SINCE. PAYMENTS FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND HOPEFULLY IF- THOSE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE NEEDED FOR US TO WORK ON WORKFORCE TRAINING. I THINK MY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT THERE LIMITED TIME IN NATURE AND THE NEEDS FOR OUR STATE OUR GREAT. MY COLLEAGUE AND CO CHAIR WAS ON A TASK FORCE THAT LOOKED AT EACH FOR WORKFORCE AND IDENTIFIED THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT. TEN YEARS AND- REALLY. DO HOPE THAT WE'VE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THIS PANDEMIC THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE DOCTORS AND NURSES OVERNIGHT. THAT WE HAVE SHORTAGES IN REGIONS OF OUR STATE AND THAT THESE INVESTMENTS. ARE NOT JUST. IMPORTANT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MANAGED CARE MEDICARE MANAED CARE PLANS TO HAVE A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE WILL HAVE. FIVE PRESENTERS WILL BEGIN WITH MISS COOPER. ALL RIGHT. I'M ALSO IN THE CALIPERS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS RECOMMENDING TO REQUIRE ALL MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DEVELOP IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OR CALLING A WHOLE SYSTEM PERSONS AND OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY- WHICH IS REALLY A COHESIVE PLAN OF ACTION FOR ADDRESSING MEMBERS NEEDS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BASED ON DATA DRIVEN INFRASTRUCTURE CATION PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AS WELL AS STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT- PROCESS THESE. EACH MANAGED CARE PLAN- WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE AT A MINIMUM- A DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY ARE I'M DOING THE FOLLOWING UP FOR ITEMS KEEPING ALL MEMBERS HEALTHY BY FOCUSING ON PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND WELLNESS SERVICES CLOSING THOSE. GAPS FOR EXAMPLE A CRITICAL PIECE- THAT WE KNOW THAT NEEDS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IDENTIFYING AND SAYS A NECESSITY MEMBER RISK AND NEED ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE AND- IT IT CAN'T CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN LIEU OF SERVICES OUTLINED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS HEARING INSURING THAT THERE ARE PROCESS SEES BRIGHT JANET BUYING MEMBERS WHO WOULD NEED THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS AND NEEDS WERE GROWING NEED OF A POPULATION. OF THE NEXT ITEM IS A MANAGING MEMBER SAFETY AND OUTCOMES DURING TRANSITIONS ACROSS DELIVERY SYSTEMS- AND SETTINGS- AS WELL THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE CARE COORDINATION SO ONE OF THE PIECES IN OUR PROCUREMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU'LL BE SEEING COMING UP YEARLY INCREASING OUR MANAGEMENT COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND THOSE COORDINATION PIECES AND REALLY WILL BE OE OF THE BACKBONES OF THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL A VERY CRITICAL AS SOMEONE IS BEING DISCHARGED FROM INPATIENT STAY OR RECENT YOUR VISIT OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STATE THOSE TRANSITION SHOULD BE SMOOTH. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE ACCESSING MULTIPLE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS YOU KNOW INTEGRATION BETWEEN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL. HEALTH AS MENTIONED EARLIER REALLY QUITE A CALL AND MAKE CONSERVE WORK. AND EXPECT. OF OUR FOR THOSE TYPES OF TRANSITIONS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. AND THEN LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND REDUCING DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLANS. SO EACH MANAGED CARE PLAN WILL WORK TO IMPLEMENT- BOTH HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION HEALTH PRINCIPLES. INTEGRATE CARE AND TO DEVELOP THOSE IDENTIFICATIONS OF WHERE CARE COORDINATION IS NEEDED ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT- BUT THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTNER UP WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES ARE THERE PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES LOCALLY. IN IN REGARDS TO THE BUILDING OF THAT POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT- IN ORDER TO CONNECT MEMBERS TO THE APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THE MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT THEN. I'M RESTRICTED BY THEIR MEMBERS INTO GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR HEALTH NEEDS ARE BASED ON AN ALGORITHM PROVIDED BY DH CS AND GROUP OF STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION. WILL BE A REQUIREMENT WITHIN THE PROPOSAL AND THE PLANTS WILL THEN- YOU KNOW THROUGH THAT RESTRAINS CATION ALGORITHM THEY WOULD USE INTEGRATED DATA SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE REQUIRING. OF CLAIMS DATA PHARMACY DATA REFERRAL- PRIOR SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT RESULTS ALL BE INCORPORATED INTO THAT RICH STRATIFICATION. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON HOW WE CAN ENHANCE AND IMPROVE THE DATA FEEDS THAT WE PROVIDE MANAGED CARE PLANS TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE WE PROVIDE OUR PLANS ALL FEE FOR SERVICE- BENEFICIARY INFORMATION SO THEY'RE AWARE OF THE OTHER SERVICES BENEFICIARIES ARE RECEIVING OUTSIDE OF THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. WILL BE A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY INCLUDE THAT IN THEIR ASSESSMENT OF SERVICES ARE. IN WE DO KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT SOME FEEDBACK FROM PLANS IN REGARDS TO MAKING THAT FILE A USER FRIENDLY AND WE ARE WORKING ON THOSE ITEMS. SO BASED. ON THEIR ALGORITHMS MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL BE READ PRIOR TO YOU- USE EIGHTEEN THE S. RISK HERE. ARE DESIGNED MAN INTO OF. RISK YEARS WHOA MEDIUM FIVE RISING. FIVE OR UNKNOWN UNKNOWN REALLY IS WHEN WE HAVE NO DATA ON AN INDIVIDUAL THEY'RE NEW TO THE PLAN EXCEPT ROCK. SO A MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL THEN BE REQUIRED TO YOU- ADMINISTER. INDIVIDUAL RISK ASSESSMENTS TO MEMBERS I WOULD JUST NOTE THERE WILL BE A SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL RISK ASSESSMENT FOR CHILDREN VERSUS ADULTS- AND- THAT INFORMATION WILL BE FED INTO THEIR RISK HERE- IT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ANYONE WHO HAS AN UNKNOWN RISK HERE. AS A WAY OF GETTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON A NEW THAT AND IF THIS YEAR- ADDITIONALLY I TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE MEMBERS. OF THE ANNUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT POPULATION RESULTS WOULD BE SHARED- IN REALLY HELP US FOCUS ON AND UNDERSTAND WHERE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE BUILDING THOSE- LOCAL ENGAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS EXCEPT- ROCK. I'M TO REALLY INFORM WHERE THERE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES- WHERE THEY'RE FOCUSING ON DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES TO CLOSE THOSEHEALTH INEQUITIES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL AS ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HELP. TO REALLY THINKING COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS THE ENTIRE POPULATION IN THINKING ABOUT THINGS AND MAYBE A DIFFERENT WAY ON THEN SOME PLANS DO WE DO KNOW THAT SOME PLANS HAVE- ROBUST POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TODAY. BUT IT DOES VERY ACROSS ACROSS THE STREET THE STATE SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT STANDARDIZATION AND REALLY UP BEING- THE REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND EXPECTATIONS THAT WE SET OUT FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO. SOME OF THE COMPONENTS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER- AGAIN THOUGH REALLY JUST WANT TO REITERATE HERE ARE WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE PLANS TO PARTNER UP WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH SOCIAL SERVICES LOCALLY- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR MOVING FORWARD. I'M SAID THIS WOULD BE ONE MORE ADDITIONAL KIND OF POINT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS- DH CS IS REQUIRING MANAGED CARE PLANS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS- BIASES IN THE ALGORITHM- THROUGH TESTING- VIEW. WOULD REQUIRE THAT THEY WE WILL GIVE THEM GUIDANCE TO THE PLANS IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY HAVE TO DO CERTAIN TESTING- AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO FILE THOSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT- THE VICE ANALYSIS AND- RECTIFYING ANY BIASES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND SO WE'LL WORK WITH OUR PLANS. A CLOSELY ON ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE OVER THE COMING YEARS. AND BEFORE THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PIECE WERE OUT I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. WHEN THAT TIME. AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. AND THIS WOULD IMPROVE PLANS ABILITY TO CONNECT THE MEMBERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH HIGH NEEDS TO NECESSARY SERVICES. AND IN DOING SO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AS WELL AS HEALTH EQUITY. WE WOULD RAISE TWO ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION- FIRST EXPANDING IN STANDARDIZING POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO ALL PLANS SHOULD INCREASE THE PLANS UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR MEMBERS NEEDS. HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE LEVERAGED TO IMPROVE IMPROVE STATE POLICYMAKERS UNDERSTANDING OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NEEDS. AND HOW THE NEW SERVICES UNDER CAL AIM ARE BETTER ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS. IN A REPORT ON EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS IN CALAIS MA'AM WE RECOMMEND A SET OF EQUITY RELATED METRICS THAT COULD BE COLLECTED AND REPORTED AT THE STATE LEVEL- CERTAIN OF THESE METRICS WOULD RELY A POTENTIALLY ON THE ENHANCED DATA COLLECTION. ON MEMBERS NEEDS THAT PLANS WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM. UNDER THIS NEW CALIBER CHOIR MAN SO FOR EXAMPLE D. H. U. S. M. WOULD IMPOSE A- WOULD HAVE A- A STANDARDIZED RISK ASSESSMENT WHERE. PLANS WOULD COLLECT SELF REPORTED HEALTH STATUS- HOUSING STABILITY FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND- WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE HOW THIS DATA COULD BE- BROUGHT UP TO THE STATE LEVEL IN THE FORM OF PUBLIC REPORTING SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. BETTER THE MEDIC MEDIC KHALFAN FISHERIES NEEDS AND THE SERVICES THAT RECEIVING. SECOND WE DO WE RECOGNIZE AS DIRECTOR COOPER JUST DISCUSSED STYLE ON. THAT DAY YOU KNOW IT THAT ALGORITHMS CAN ASSIST IN THE IDENTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION OF BENEFICIARIES. WHO BENEFIT FROM ENHANCED CARE COORDINATION OTHER SERVICES BUT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT- SUCH ALGORITHMS CAN DISPLAY RACIAL AND ETHNIC BIAS OUT PREVENTING HIGH NEEDS INDIVIDUALS- FROM- FROM CERTAIN RACIAL GROUPS FROM RECEIVING EQUITABLE. ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SO JUST WITHOUT- SIX TO THE- TO AS DH CS IMPLEMENTS- THIS THIS NEW PROGRAM PROVIDED IT IS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE TENT JUST CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE THE GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT THAT DHS IS PROVIDING OVER- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. AS REGARDS THE RISK STRATIFICATION OF- OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE INTO THE DIFFERENT TIERS AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CATHERINE BARRESI WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF CARE COORDINATION AT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA. EIGHT THINK PEOPLE CARE WITHIN TURN AROUND ELEVEN- PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA IF A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED. ORGANIZATIONS THAT STRIVE ON MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OF THE FOURTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE- PARTNERSHIP IT IS A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL WITHIN COUNTY AND- IT WILL ALLOW FOR AN ORGANIZED APPROACH TO THE IDENTIFICATION AND VARIOUS NEEDS OF OUR MEMBERS- IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF DIRECT SUPPORT OF SERVICES SUCH AS BASIC AND COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT PLANS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE PROPOSAL TO READILY IDENTIFY SUBPOPULATIONS. WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERSHIP- THAT MAY BE EXPERIENCING HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES DIFFERENTLY DUE TO SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY- THE CHALLENGE WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION- PROPOSAL WITH AN ACCOUNT NAME IS THAT IT IS NOT IN ALIGNMENT WITH NCQA DEFINITIONS ACTIVITY FOR POPULATION HEALTH UNDER NCQA- THE CURRENT KELLY PROPOSAL- FOR INSTANCE INCLUDES THE MANDATORY TIERED SYSTEM BUT- A DIRECTOR FOR PROJECT SPOKE TO- AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ALIGN. WITH EXISTING MANAGED CARE PLAN RESTAURANT OF PETITIONS IN PLACE- THIS DISCONNECT MAY ACTUALLY RESULT IN THE PATIENT BEING CATEGORIZED AT ONE LEVEL FOR THE STATE AND AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL FOR THE NCQA OR PLAN THE THING PURPOSES. OUT WE WOULD ADVOCATE THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF BOTH A COMPREHENSIVE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALIGNED AND TIME TO SPEAK THE PROPOSAL WITH THE PROPOSED AND SECURE WAY MANDATE LANGUAGE WITHIN THE CAL IN PROPOSAL- DOCTOR. THAT SHIF IN THE TIMELINE WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT IMPLANTS MORE COHESION AND THOUGHTFUL PLANNING IN CROSS WALKING SOME OF THE INITIATIVES THAT DCS- IS LOOKING TOWARDS PLANS TO IMPLEMENT ALONG WITH THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK. AND REQUIREMENTS OF AND KEEP YOU WAYS THAT CAN BE QUITE RIGOROUS- FOR EXAMPLE- CURRENTLY STATE IN THE NCQA STANDARDS- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT FIVE IS ACTUALLY COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND SUBJECT TO FINAL REVIEW AND HAVE ABOUT TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT DATA ELEMENTS POINTS. TO WHICH AND TO KEEP A LOOK THAT. MMHM I DON'T WANT THE OTHER COMMENT REGARD BIAS- WE DO SEE AND IT IS- AND FACE THAT YOU THINK. BASED ALLOW. TO RESTAURANT PLAN A POPULATION FIFTY THREE- IT SHOULD FIVE AND THAT WE THERE ARE- POPULATE. AND FOLK THAT ARE OUT MARK. AND NOT PRACTICING SIR. THEREFORE DATA IS NOT IN THAT UTILIZATION. SO TO PREVENT THIS- WE DEFINITELY WOULD WELCOME AND SUPPORT AN ADVOCATE FOR DCF TO EXPLORE OTHER. AVENUES OF- ALTERNATE GATED TO SUPPLY TO THE PLAN- WHEN COMING UP WITH A FRAMEWORK- LOOKING TO OTHER. DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ALIGNING THEIR INITIATIVE- BETTER CLEARLY OUTLINED WITH SOME LOCAL POPULATIONS MEANS- SO THAT ARE WORKING BE- IN ALIGNMENT AND NOT. AFTER THE FIRST ONE OTHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TIME FOR HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MIKE THOSE WITH CHILDREN NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME. YOU HAVE TO LIVE TODAY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY AT CHILDREN NOW THE NONPARTISAN WHOLE CHILD RESEARCH POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ANY KNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AMERICANS JUST HOW IT. ALSO AS YOU KNOW MEDICAL COVERS HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN PLACE FOR OVER HALF OF ALL. STATE HI AND THIS. IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE PERSISTENT AND SIGNIFICANT RACIAL AND LINGUISTIC DISPARITIES IN CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO CARE. SOME OF THE FOCUS OF POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. ACCOUNTING IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT'S ACTUALLY THE FINANCING THAT IS THE INTERVAL. THAT IS INTEGRAL TO THE MANAGED CARE BUSINESS MODEL SO FINANCING HAS TO BE GOING TO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. BUT THERE T BE ACTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT THE STATE HAS NOT PROPOSED ANY NEW INCENTIVES RESOURCES OR INFRASTRUCTURE HELPING TO SUPPORT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. SO IT'S SORT OF TRUSTING THAT MEANS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT. SERIOUSLY- AND EXECUTED. THE STRUCTURE STRUCTURAL WHAT FINANCING DYNAMIC IS PRECISELY WHY. YOU SEE LOWER RATES OF UTILIZATION AND SCREENING AND MANY YEARS OF LOW AND DECLINING QUALITY OF CARE FOR CARE. IN PRACTICE THIS MEANS THAT KIDS AREN'T LOSING OUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING VACCINATIONS FOR MEASLES WHICH ARE OFTEN STAY SAFE FROM DISEASES LIKE MEASLES WHICH IS THAT WE ARE FOR BAND BAND COBIT. AND THEY ARE GETTING THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IDENTIFIED TO MY- THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED IT'S COMPLY. I'M IN OTHER WORDS THE FISCAL AND- BY WHICH THE STATE HE'S AN OVERSEAS PLANS ARE CONDITIONALLY MISALIGNED. INCENTIVES FOR PROACTIVELY MANAGING TO HELP MEMBER POPULATION. TO ALIGN WITH POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND- WE SUGGEST THAT THE STATE ONE ESTABLECER APARTMENT THAT TRANSCEND A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THEIR CAPITATED PAYMENT PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE- THEY MAKE INVESTMENTS IN BASIC CARE COORDINATION BECAUSE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY DOESN'T EXIST TODAY. AND THREE ESTABLISH A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM USING WITHHOLDING INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE CLIENTS TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE FOR THE MEMBER POPULATIONS. PREVENTION POPULATION HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO ACT ACCORDING IN ATTENTION UNLESS PAYMENT REFORMS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERTAKEN AND THERE'S A MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT BY THE STATE THE WHOLE PLANS ACCOUNT. SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO- WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED ALREADY IN CALTRAIN IT'S NOT BEEN MADE CLEAR HOW. THE CALEDON COAL MINE WITH OTHER POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT APPROACHES LIKE TO ST PAUL HOW- SO MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE STATE BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT I HAVE MORE BUILT IN TIME ONCE FOR STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT REPUTATION. I'D ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE TAKES STEPS TO PROTECT THE FOUNDATIONAL PSTG GUARANTEE THAT KIDS IN MEDICAL CAN ACCESS ALL THE- MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES AVAILABLE. AND THIS SHOULD BE DONE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND CONTRACTS AND GUIDANCE. AND FINALLY WE HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INEQUITIES THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE WILD VARIATION AND FLEXIBILITY. GIVEN TO HELP INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW VALUE RATE RISK. ARTERIAS DIFFERENT PLAN CHOICES COULD RESULT IN VERY DIFFERENT BENEFITS WERE SIMILARLY SITUATED CHILDREN READING SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT COMPOUNDING AND EXACERBATING INEQUITIES. SO IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST OFFERED AT THE STATE AND CITY MORE ON HOW THE CASE. IS FOR CHILDREN'S CHARACTER OUT MEDIC HOW- AND SPECIFICALLY BY MAKING FINANCING REFORMS THAT WILL BETTER ALIGN WITH MARTIN STATED GOALS OF POPULATION HEALTH AND PREVENTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR DAY NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KERRY SANDERS SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA. PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. I AFTERNOON A CHECK AND- MY NAME IS CARRIE SANDERS ASKING YOUR POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK- DEPEND IS A pADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. STEPHEN WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE CALENDAR SESSIONS AT THE MEMBER THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND NCQA ACCREDITATION WORKGROUPS. AND AUTOMATIC COMMENT LETTERS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE SET OF PROPOSALS AND COUNTING. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR HOLDING THIS JOINT HEARING TODAY AND THE STAFF AT DH THE ASK. FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON ADVANCING THE FOUNDATION'S BETTER PROPOSAL. ALERT THE MAJORITY OF ENROLLEES MEDICARE MANAGED CARE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION. AND HAVE POOR OUTCOMES ON KEY HEALTH INDICATORS INCLUDING ASTHMA. DIABETES AND MENTAL HEALTH. CALIFORNIA CALLING PROPOSAL INCLUDES FAR REACHING REFORMS AND A STATED COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES. YET VERY FEW PAYMENT AND DELIVERY REFORM EFFORTS ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO MEASURABLY REDUCING THAT. CHALLENGE FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS. THROUGH THE NEW POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. TOWARD THE MORE UPSTREAM COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO CARE. WITH THE PHM INITIATIVE CALIFORNIA JOINS OTHER STATES AND ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPACT HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER THE COUNTY PROPOSAL AND- INITIATIVES A VERY NARROW DEFINITION THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. WELL PLANNED- ACQUIRED STRATIFY IN SEGMENT THEIR ENTIRE POPULATION THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESTAURANT EDUCATION IMPLEMENTATION EXERCISE. IS IDENTIFIED MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR TOP ONE TO FIVE PERCENT. THE GREATEST UTILIZES OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WHO INCURRED THE HIGHEST FOR BENEFICIARY COST. TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REMAINING 95% OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES YOU ALSO NEED MORE PREVENTATIVE AND I'M STRETCHING INTERVENTION. WELL THERE CERTAINLY SHOULD BE STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT THESE HIGH INTEREST BENEFICIARIES WHO MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE COMORBIDITIES. A TRULY COMPREHENSIVE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WHAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR MEDICAL POPULATION TO ARE FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS RACIAL AND ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL PLUMMETED INTO PROFICIENTLY PROFICIENCY AS THERE ARE ALREADY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS. AND HAVE EXPERIENCED ADVERSE. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IT'S POPULOUS NEAR CLUB OF CARE TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY YET MANY PLANS ARE STILL FALLING SHORT TODAY ON DELIVERING THE BASICS INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF LANGUAGES THE CONSERVATIVE. TIMELY PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PHM INITIATIVE IS TRULY MEETING UPDATED OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING CARE FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION WE PUT FORTH TO THE FOLLOWING SIX RECOMMENDATION. FIRST WE RECOMMEND TO FINANCIAL INCENTIVES IN CALLING BE TIED TO ACHIEVING POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT GOALS FOR THE ENTIRE MEDICAL POPULATION. THIS INCLUDES THE FOUNDATIONAL PREVENTATIVE CARE AND OVERALL CARE COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO THIRD THE OTHER 95299% AND IT'S IN GREAT NEED OF ATTENTION AND IMPROVEMENT. SECOND WE STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE L. RECOMMENDATION THE DHS FORMULATE SPECIFIC EQUITY METRICS TO ENSURE CALENDAR MEETING POLITICAL. IT'S NOT TRICKS WOULD NOT ONLY BE INCLUSIVE OF CARE DELIVERING pINCLUDE PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION HOUSING STABILITY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INVOLVING CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TYPE OF DASHBOARD SHOULD BE REQUIRED. THIRD ALL THE METRICS AND THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND THE FINISH THAT AND ANY INITIATIVE A MEDIC CAL SHOULD BE COLLECTED AND REPORTED BY AGE SEX RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND DISABILITY STATUS AT A MINIMUM. ALTHOUGH THE STATE IS SUPPOSED TO BE COLLECTED IT'S NOT HAPPENING TODAY MANAGED CARE PLANS MUST BE REQUIRED TO REPORT THIS DATA AND DHS NOT URGENTLY INVEST IN THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED INCLUDING MUCH NEEDED UPGRADES TO THE MATH SYSTEM TO FACILITATE THE TYPE OF REPORTING. FOR H. OF MESSENGER RESTAURANT OCCASION SEGMENTATION DOES NOT FURTHER EXACERBATE HEALTH DISPARITIES. RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT DATA ANALYTICS TOOL THESE PERFECT HEALTH RISK THE MAIN COULD RACIAL AND ETHNIC BIASES THAT AND INTO UNTESTED PERPETUATE HEALTH INEQUITIES. WORTH MOST HEALTH SYSTEMS CHOOSE COST OR UTILIZATION OF THE PROPERTY FOR HEALTH USING MEDICAL CLAIMS DATA TO PREDICT NEED FOR CARE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SUPPORT. NEXT GROUP PATIENTS OF COLOR. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND LGBTQ PLUS PATIENTS WHO IS DIRECTLY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO BOTH PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE DUE TO DISCRIMINATION POVERTY. AND OTHER STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. IF THESE BARRIERS TO ACCESSIBLE IN LOWER UTILIZATION AMONG PATIENTS OF COLOR DESPITE EQUIVALENT DIAGNOSES THE NEED FOR SERVICES SOME RISK ALGORITHMS MAY INADVERTENTLY PERPETUATE DISPARITIES BY COATING THE PATIENT. HAS LEFT THE NEED OF CARE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SUPPORT. IT WAS RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL BIAS AND HEART IN ALGORITHMS AND NOT CORRECTLY STATED IT WILL QUITE REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO CORRECT THIS. BY REQUIRING PLANT INCORPORATE OTHER DATA SUCH AS HEALTH CONDITIONS. RISK FACTORS AND DISEASE PROGRESSION. AND I EQUITY AND- IDENTIFYING CORRECT BY THE- AND SUBMITTING TO DO. HE LIST OF THANK- AND I DATA SOURCE. OF ALL PLANS MAKE REPEAT OF AND OF FOR VIEWING ON THE WEBSITE. WHICH ON THE NEW REQUIRE- WE PART HEALTH PLAN IN CALLING TRADITIONAL DATA SOURCES TO BE USED. BEYOND CLINICAL CLAIMS DATA CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE AFTER CONDITIONALLY HELP PROVIDE DHS ON ITS ALGORITHM GUIDANCE. AND DHS REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS. CONCERNS THAT WE RECOMMEND STRONGER TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PHM REQUIREMENTS. UNDER CALLING PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCORPORATE THE FINDINGS OF DHS'S POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND NCQA POPULATION HEALTH PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. HE ACCEPTED PNA FOR THE PRIMARY TOOL TO HELP PLANT USED TODAY TRANSFORM THE REQUIRED DISPARITIES THAT PREVENT PROJECTS. GET THERE NO CLEAR DISPARITIES REDUCTION TARGETS FOR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TIED TO CHEESE ACHIEVING PNA DISCOURAGE REDUCTION GOAL AND NOT BECAUSE OF BEEN TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR YEARS TO VIEW- THE PLAN IN ORDER TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT HEALTH PLANS ARE ACTUALLY DOING TO CLOSE GAPS IN DISPARITIES IN CARE. ALL OF THESE PLANS WILL STRATEGIES AND FINING SHOULD BE SHARED PUBLICLY. LASTLY IT MOVING FORWARD WE RECOMMEND THE DHS EXPAND OUR CONSIDER EXPANDING THE INFLUENCE SERVICES BENEFITS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HEALTH RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS. AND MAKE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE BROADER MEDICAL POPULATION OF STATES LIKE OREGON HAVE DONE. THESE COULD BE USED TO COVER THINGS LIKE NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION FOOD FROM FOR THE FARMERS MARKET SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD TEMPORARY HOUSING OR SHELTER UTILITIES AND REPAIRS. THEY COULD BE INCLUDED AS MEDICAL COSTS IN THE MLR AND INCLUDED IN FUTURE RATE SETTING. BURGUNDY FEELS WORKED WITH REGIONAL MULTI STAKEHOLDER COALITION SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA'S ACCOUNTABLE COMMUNITIES FOR HEALTH. IMPLEMENTING THE LESSONS AND EXPERIENCES OF OUR OWN- CATCHY SITES COULD BE APPLIED YOU IMPLEMENTATION THE- AS WELL AS THE- CALLING AND I'LL LAST. AND I POPULATION HEALTH MENTIONS TO. INCLUDE WE WOULD LIKE TO BECOME DO MORE TO DRAW POP IN A AND CAL AND TO CALLING MORE BROADLY. THANK PAYMENT AND DELIVERY OF STRATEGY WITH THE TYPE. FOR THE REDUCTION OF HEALTH INEQUITIES OVER IN BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT DOES CONCLUDE THIS PANEL I WILL NOW ASK IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WOULD. YES SO THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE- OF THE- STAKEHOLDERS- SO I'M MY QUESTION IS HOW IS WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT THE PLANS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO DO NOW. SO THAT'S A REALLY LONG LIST OF THINGS JUST TO BE CLEAR SO THERE ARE SOME COMPONENTS IN AB MENTIONED BY SOME I'M SOME OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NCQA ACCREDITED- AND SOME ARE NOT- AND SO WHERE THERE IS OVERLAP THERE WOULD BE APPLIED THOSE PLANS TO BE IN. HAVE BECOME INSECURE ACCREDITED AND FOCUS ON SOME OF THE POPULATION HELP PIECES- BUT THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT WANT TO WAIT FOR OUR NCQA PROPOSED REQUIREMENT. OF A TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO- INSURE THAT ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE THINKING ABOUT AND PROVIDING THESE SERVICES- I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE WILL BE VERY FOCUSED ON AS MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS. HAS TO DO AROUND FOR EXAMPLE IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING UP SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN CAROLINE IS GOING TO BE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS AS THEY GATHER THAT INFORMATION INCLUDING PROVIDERS REPORT THAT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT WITH CPT CODES FOR EXAMPLE- AND THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE RESTAURANT LOCATION DATA- WELL I LISTED A FEW EXAMPLES THAT WAS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. LIST OF SERVICES AND INCLUDES BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL COMPONENTS FOR THAT RESTAURANT EDUCATION- THE OTHER THING IS THAT WHILE SOME MANAGED CARE PLANS MAY DO A RESTAURANT THE KITCHEN TODAY- INDOOR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IT WOULD BE STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE. SO THAT IF THE BENEFICIARY TRANSITIONS FROM PLAN TO PLAN THERE IS A- A SENSE OF. UNDERSTANDING IF THAT'S GOING TO GO ACROSS THE VARIOUS MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO- LOW AT MEDIUM RISING HIGH OR UNKNOWN RISK- SO THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE I WOULD MENTION- BEAR. WE ALSO- WELL I AGREE I HISTORICALLY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISPARITIES ARE INEQUITIES REPORTED THOSE THINGS PUBLICLY- AND REQUIRED CERTAIN COMPONENTS WITHIN THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS. VERY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING BOTH A SHORT. TERM AND LONG TERM- AT WITH THE ROAD MAP WHERE WE ARE IT'S- GET CLOSURE IN BOTH QUALITY METRICS AS WELL AS- INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION FOCUSED ON CERTAIN POPULATIONS- ESPECIALLY AROUND THE POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT- THAT WE ARE REQUIRING- WANTING IN REGARDS TO THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRING THAT PLANS CLOSELY ENGAGED WITH. THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH COLLEAGUES. AS WELL AS REALLY INCREASING THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD MODELS THAT ARE GOING TO CLOSE THOSE EQUITIES. AND GAPS OF CARE OF FOR BENEFICIARIES ACROSS THE STATE. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT THE LIST IS ACTUALLY QUITE EXPENSIVE- EVEN HAVE STANDARDIZED A TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS OF THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT IN OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS TODAY. THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY- THAT IS CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THE PLAN CONTRACT HAS CERTAIN CLEAR AREAS WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS. I BEG- AND THAT HAS ALLOWED FOR A LARGE DIFFERENCE OF PLANT PLAN IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT THEY ARE CLEARLY. RESPONSIBLE FOR TODAY AND THE DEPARTMENT- EXPECTS- REALLY TIGHTEN UP ON THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO MAKE IT CLEAR- CERTAIN MINIMUM CRITERIA OF ACTIONS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT MUST TAKE PLACE IN REGARDS TO- THOSE ACTIONS AS WELL AS- RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE THINK ARE CRITICAL TO MOVE. THE NEEDLE IN THAT SPACE AND SO- I COULD GO ON- BUT- JUST WANTED TO NAME A FEW OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON DIFFERENCES FROM. WHAT THE PLANS DO TODAY. APPRECIATE THAT- AS WE LOOK AT A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM- CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET DATA WHAT DATA YOU'RE YOU MIGHT BE REQUIRING AN AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO UTILIZE THAT DATA I MEAN. WE NEED SOME YET THERE NEED TO BE METRICS OBVIOUSLY AND THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED HERE FROM THIS SO WHAT IS THE DATA PART OF THIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND- WHERE WE'RE AT THE REQUIREMENTS TO SUBMIT. POPULATION HEALTH DATA SO WE UNDERSTAND SO WHAT TO EXPECT HAVE SOME METRICS FOR SUCCESS HERE. YES SO- I MEAN I THINK IF THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ANYTHING ABOUT THERE WE WILL BE REQUIRING PLANTS USE- A PRETTY EXTENSIVE LIST OF DATA THAT THEY HAVE THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS- DATA THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS WHETHER IT'S FROM- OUR ENCOUNTER DATA OR OTHER DATA THAT WE GET FROM. SISTER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE FEED TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME OF THAT NON CLINICAL DATA THAT WILL ALL ROLL UP INTO THE VARIOUS RISK CATEGORIES. ON THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPORTED TO US I THINK THE OTHER BIG ITEM IS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DATA BEING REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. THAT WILL GREATLY ALLOW US TO LOOK AT DATA AND SLICE DATA AND LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR BENEFITS AS WELL AS- DELIVERY SYSTEM CHANGES POLICY PIECES THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE INSIGHT INTO TODAY- IN COLLECTING AND USING THAT FOR ANALYTICS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND APPROACH- I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW AND WHAT MEASURES WE LOOK AT THE CROSS OVER ONE OF THE BIG PIECES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. WHAT ARE THOSE QUALITY METRICS THAT CLEARLY OF GO ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE QUALITY METRICS BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE PUT IN- COMPREHENSIVE CARE COORDINATION. REFERRAL OF A KIND OF MECHANISMS AND REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING LOST AS THEY TRANSITION FROM ONE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO THE OTHER FOR EXAMPLE IS MIKE WAS MENTIONING EARLIER ON THE DENTAL SERVICES ENSURING THAT THOSE GAPS ARE BEING CLOSED IN THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICES. SO THAT IS WHERE WE WILL BE FOCUSING SOME OF OUR EFFORTS IN REGARDS TO LOOKING AT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE ONE OUT WERE CLOSING- GAPS ACROSS DELIVERY SYSTEMS- SURE THAT THOSE. ARE ENTERED. IN THE- COURT NEEDED AND THEN ASK MENTIONED EARLIER LOOKING AT CLOSING THOSE EQUITY GAPS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT WHAT THAT WOULD BE. I DON'T HAVE A LIST FOR YOU TODAY BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE PLAN ON FULLY ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. IN REGARDS TO WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT BERMAN EQUITY POINT OF VIEW AND HOW WE WILL MEASURE THAT ALL PLANS ACCOUNTABLE IN INCENTIVIZE THAT- THROUGH VARIOUS MECHANISMS. THANK YOU I GUESS I ENVISION. DATA COLLECTION. IN A VERY VERY BROAD WAY THAT'LL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY. DO THE RESEARCH NECESSARY FOR ENTIRE POPULATION HEALTH SO I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT. THAT THIS DATA THREE DH CS IT WILL BE COLLECTED. WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO BE COORDINATED WITH OTHER DATA THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY MEDICARE AS WE START LOOKING INDIVIDUAL POPULATIONS OUT THERE. AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE FOR EVERYONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO ANYWAY. THAT'S JUST MY EDITORIAL PART THERE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED CHASING. I WILL HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE WE CLOSE THIS PANEL- AND IT'S- FOR DH CS AGAIN. ARE THERE CURRENTLY ANY EXISTING MODELS OF MANAGED CARE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT THAT WE WANT THE PLANS TO FOLLOW. FOR EXAMPLE DOES KAISER AND THEIR COMMERCIAL COVERAGE UTILIZED THIS APPROACH. INTERESTING QUESTION- SO I THINK- YEAH I THINK KAISER IS A GREAT EXAMPLE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU OF WHERE YOU CAN SEE AN EFFECTIVE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT TIED TO- OVER A BEST ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THAT REALLY- IT ALLOWS YOU TO IDENTIFY. CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND ENSURE THAT- CARE GAPS ARE BEING CLOSED I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE VALUES OF AN INTEGRATED MODEL WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF DRIVE TO SOME OF THOSE FACTORS I DO STILL THINK THAT THERE ARE. OPPORTUNITIES ON THERE OF COURSE- BUT- CLEARLY- RESPECTIVE OF SOME OF THEIR QUALITY SCORES BEING SOME OF THE PAST IN IN MEDICARE LIKE IF HE GETS A GREAT EXAMPLE I ALSO THINK THAT IN C. Q. A. OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PIECES ARE ARE GOOD- HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S WANTING TO RAISE THE BAR A LITTLE BIT BE A LITTLE. BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN REGARDS TO OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT REQUIRED REQUIREMENT SO WHILE I- RESPECT AROUND ALIGNING WITH NCQA I THINK WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS CALIFORNIA WOULD RATHER PARTNER WITH NCQA- TO YOU- REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE AND GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT CHANGES- SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WOULD ADD TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT WE WILL THANK THE FOURTH PANEL. AND MOVE ON THE PANEL FIVE. THANK VERY MUCH DOCTOR. WORK MOVE ON A FIFTY. WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT ON DH CS TO STANDARDIZE THE MEDICARE BENEFIT PACKAGE. I WAS FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THIS LAST WEEK- RELATED TO KAISER COVERAGES SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN TWO COUNTIES. WE HAD A LATE SUBSTITUTION ON THE PANEL STACEY SOLOMON DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS AT MOUNTAIN SHADOWS WILL BE SPEAKING ON THIS PANEL. SHE IS TAKING THE PLACE OF MARC CLAUS. SO THE PANEL WILL INCLUDE A J. C. COOPER. ARC- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND THE TEN OR STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR- BEN JOHNSON- ARE THERE ARE PRINCIPLES. AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE L. A. O. ABIGAIL. FOR ABBY- COURSE SELL. A SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM AND STACEY SOLOMON AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE DIRECTOR. OF OPERATIONS FOR MOUNTAIN SHADOWS SO BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT WE- WE GAVE YOU A NUMBER- FOR COLIN IS THIS IS THE FIFTH PANEL WE HAVE ONE MORE AFTER THIS BUT I WANT TO. AND IT WILL BE A REPEATED AGAIN BUT THE CALL IN NUMBER WE GET WAS CORRECT. BUT THE CODE WITH ACCESS CODE WAS NOT SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO GET. IN LINE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- THE PUBLIC-COMMENT- CALL IN NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. SEVEN THREE TWO. SIX TWO FOUR TWO. SO ONCE AGAIN IT'S EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. SEVEN THREE TWO SIX TWO FOUR TWO AND WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- AND- THE CHEAPER- CONTINUE- THIS COOPER. THANK YOU. SO ONE OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES AROUND CALTRAIN IS TO STANDARDIZE- ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE COUNTY THAT YOU LIVE IN- DOESN'T DICTATE ON THE KERRY HERBAL- WHERE YOU GET OR WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING AND SO ON THAT IS THE ONE OF THE KIND OF CORE PIECES HERE SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT OF WHAT'S PROVIDED THROUGH OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ON STATEWIDE- THAT DOES INCLUDE- CARVING OUT. ON CERTAIN SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WE AT EVERYONE IS VERY WE'RE PROPOSING TO CARVE A PHARMACY- SERVICES I'M OUT OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- THE DATE FOR THAT TRANSITION IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED BUT WELL INFORMED INDIVIDUALS AS SOON AS WE HAVE A NEW CAR ABOUT DATE I'M ALSO- BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWO PROPOSING A TO CARVE OUT THE SPECIAL TEAM A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- IN BOTH SOLANO IN SACRAMENTO CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY KAISER I'M BACK TO AT THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENTITIES THAT WAS HEARD AT THE PREVIOUS HEARING- AND THEN LASTLY CARVING OUT THE- MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES. AFTER WE ARE PROPOSED TO CARP IN- HANDFUL OF BENEFITS- JANUARY OF TWENTY ALL ORGANS NOT KERR WITHIN SCOPE OF ANY OF THE MANAGED CARE I'M THEIR JUST NOTATING THE SOME OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ALREADY HAVE A MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS CARP IN ONTO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY- AND JUST STANDARDIZING THAT ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN ADDITIONALLY I BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE- INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE. I'M NOT CURRENTLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF MANY MANAGED CARE PLANS BEING CARP IN. THE TO THE MAIN CARE PLANS. AND THEN IT THERE ALSO WOULD HIGHLY THAT. ON LONG TERM IS CAR INTO CODES CANNY COUNTIES AS WELL AS C. C. I TELL- ARE SOME OF OUR- COUNTIES BUT IT. A NUMBER OF LICENSE. HERE AGAIN JUST ASKIN. THAT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE REGARDLESS OF MODEL OF MANAGED CARE THAT YOU'RE AN- IDEA ACS I DOES HAVE THE ABILITY- TODAY TO DETERMINE WHAT BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH MANAGED CARE VERSUS THE FOR SERVICE. CURRENTLY WE DO THAT THROUGH- TYPICALLY THE BUDGET PROCESS IT FOR MAKING LARGE CHANGES THROUGH THAT MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACT CHANGES AS WELL AS- DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT WITHIN OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER THAT WE FILED WITH CMS AS IT IS. CRITICAL TO NOTE WHICH DELIVERY SYSTEM IS REQUIRED FOR WHICH SERVICES. I'M DCS DOES INTEND TO USE THE MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS TO ADD THE NEW BENEFITS- THAT ARE PART OF THE CALLIN PIECES THAT I JUST RECOMMENDED. I'M INCLUDING CLEAR- EXPECTATIONS IN REGARDS TO THOSE AT TRANSITION AND SERVICES- AT THE END IT SHOULD'VE UP PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE COVERAGE OF. MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS TO ALL NON- CODES COUNTIES I MENTION THAT BECAUSE CURRENTLY BECAUSE COUNTIES TO COVER A LARGE VARIETY OF. THE. MORGAN THE FORGET- THAT TRAIN. SERVICES AT TODAY AND OF OUR CARE COVER SOME OF VERY SHORT LIST OF- ORGAN TRANSPLANTS- TODAY'S BOB. UNDER THE REIMBURSEMENT OF BAD LANGUAGE THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL THEIR CREDIT TO PRIMARY- ARE PROPOSAL REASONS OF WHY WE INCLUDED ON THAT LANGUAGE THE FIRST IS TO YOU- GUARANTEE PROVIDERS HAVE THE OPTION. TO RECEIVE AT LEAST THE SAME RATE THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE GET FROM OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THROUGH MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE SO ESSENTIALLY ENSURING. THAT MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE RATES FOR BENEFICIARIES- I MEAN PROVIDER SORRY- AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE ABILITY TO OFFER THE BENEFITS AND EXPAND THEIR NETWORKS ACCORDINGLY FROM A- LESS DISADVANTAGED POSITION- WHICH HELPS LIMIT POTENTIAL FINANCIAL COSTS. THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ON MAKING HER IF A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE ARE TAKING THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE RATES TODAY- WE WOULD WANT THEM TO AT A MINIMUM I TAKE THAT RATE AS OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD BE ABLE TO. MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS IN REGARDS TO NETWORK ADEQUACY WITH THE BENEFIT TRANSITIONS AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE PROVIDERS AS A PART OF THEIR NETWORK OF COURSE THE TRAILER BILL ALLOWS FOR THE FLEXIBILITY FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS TO YOU COME TO A- NEGOTIATION. A MUTUAL AGREEMENT IN NEGOTIATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE AMOUNT OR PAYMENT METHODOLOGY- SO WE DO A LOT FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY- THIS IS FOR BOTH MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANT TRANSITIONS AS WELL AS LONG TERM CARE- AND WHAT WE FEEL IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT WHICH IS WHY- YOU REALLY SEE THAT PART- LISTED IN THAT THE TRADE. BILL LANGUAGE. SO I KNOW ONE THING I DO WANTED OF FOUGHT FOCUS ON IT IS WHY. WE ARE. LOOKING BOTH LONG TERM CARE TRANSPLANTS- SO AS A- PREVIOUS LONG TERM CARE IS. CARP IN IN COAST- AS WELL AS IN CCI- BY COUNTIES- WITH THE MAJORITY- SORRY WITH THE MANDATORY ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS. FOR TOOLS PARTIAL BOWLS AND NON TOOLS- IT ALSO REALLY ALLOWED US TO INCLUDE- LONG TERM. CARE SHARE COST BENEFICIARIES FOR EXAMPLE- BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WERE PROPOSING TO PARK LONG TERM CARE AND- MAKE MANDATORY BOTH. OR DUAL- PARTIAL DUAL AND NON TOOLS TO BE MANDATORY MANAGED CARE- AND THAT INCLUDED THE SHERIFF COSTS THE REASON WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE MOST LONG TERM CARE. BENEFICIARIES A MEET THEIR SHARE OF COST ON THE- ON THE FIRST DAY- OF THAT SHARE COSTS AND SO- IN A CRITICAL KIND OF. ADDED THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE REST THAT PROPOSAL THERE. IT REALLY WILL ALLOW THE PLANS- TO HAVE- YOU NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT IN THE LIEU OF SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE ADDED THROUGH CALLING- AND THE RESULTING SAVINGS UP FOR THE STATE AND PLANS BY- ENSURING THAT THEY ARE MAXIMIZING THOSE INTO OF SERVICES. IN TRANSITIONING PEOPLE WHEN APPROPRIATE- TO THEIR HOME AND OR COMMUNITY OF AND SO BY MAKING BOTH THE POPULATION TO BE MANDATORY FOR MANAGED CARE THAT VARIES ACROSS THE STATE. CARVING IN LONG TERM CARE GIVING THEM THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT THAT HAS A SPECIFIC TARGET POPULATION ON TRANSITIONS FOR IN INDIVIDUALS. AND INSTITUTIONAL A LEVEL OF CARE AND THAT. THAT SWEET EVAN LOW SERVICES AROUND TRANSITIONS HOME MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS HOME MODIFICATIONS THAT ALLOW SOMEONE TO RESIDE SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES. WE DO THINK WE'RE GIVING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ALL THE TOOLS TO BE SUCCESSFUL ON TO BUILD OUT- THAT DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND THEN LASTLY ON ON. THAT FRONT FOR THE LONG TERM CARE AS WE BILD UP THOSE INCLUDE SERVICES IT REALLY GIVES US THE ROAD NOW TO. A MANAGED TERMS. IN SUPPORTS BY TWO TWENTY SO. FOR THAT NEXT. SUBMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. THAT COULD HOUSE IN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND MAKING SURE THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- IN THE LOCATION. OF THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES- ADDITIONALLY FOR THE TRANSPLANT SERVICES WOULD JUST. FOCUS HERE THAT YOU KNOW. WE WENT ACROSS THE STATE AND HEARD A FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE AROUND TRANSPLANT. THE WAY THAT WE ARE CARVING OUT SOMEONE NEEDS A MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANT FROM MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE. IT REALLY IS JUST CREATING A LOT OF. ISSUES FOR OUR BENEFICIARIES I'M GOING IN AND OUT OF MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE FOR ON THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF SERVICE. ARE BOTH CONTINUITY OF CARE AS WELL AS JUST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVIDER AND FAMILIES. REALLY CREATED A LOT OF CHALLENGES. AND WE HAD SUCCESS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES WITH TRANSPLANTS BEING CARVED IN A WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THINGS LIKE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN ENSURING THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE GETTING A GREAT ACCESS TO- THOSE MAJOR ORGAN TRANSPLANT SERVICES- BUT REALLY THINK THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST. OF THE BENEFICIARY FOR THAT TO BE CARVED IN IN STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON A DAY THE CURRENT NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES IS TIMELY. ACCESS SINCE THE MEMBER DOES NOT TRAVEL TO THE FACILITY OUR TIME AND DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME. THAT THE NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS WERE CODIFIED IN STATE- STATUTE- THIS THERE IS NO STANDARD IN STATE LAW A TWO DAY. WHEN CONSIDERING THAT SETTING TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS- DUE TO DO AN OVERALL KIND OF SHORTAGE. OF LONG TERM CARE BEDS STATEWIDE- THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MANY FACTORS SUCH AS BED AVAILABILITY. DISABILITY CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALTY FACILITIES THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE OF THE MEMBERS COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. ON THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT RECOMMEND IMPLEMENTING TIME DISTANCE STANDARD- FOR LONG TERM CARE AT THIS TIME- BUT- HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES HAVE. ON THE OPTION FOR SERVICES REALLY FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT ALL THE AVAILABLE POTENTIAL SERVICES INCLUDING- PROVIDING THOSE ADDITIONAL ROB SERVICES SO SOMEONE CAN REMAIN IN THEIR HOME- TRANSITIONS TO ASSISTED LIVING. FACILITIES AS MENTIONED EARLIER UNLIKE RCF VI'S AND ARCS I'M IN LOOKING AT THE FULL ARRAY OF OPTIONS FOR SOMEONE IN LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND NOT ONLY LOOKING AT. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON. A NETWORK ADEQUACY TO ALL OF THOSE SERVICES INCLUDING THE RAMP UP OF OUR AND- OF SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH- CALLIN. AND LASTLY WOULD JUST NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS MEMBER EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE SERVICES FOCUSED ON- CURRENTLY DONE THREE STUDIES CONDUCTED BY OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW. ORGANIZATIONS UP THAT. CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW ON TO OUR SECOND PANELIST- BEN JOHNSON. GOOD AFTERNOON I HAVEN'T WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE BENEFITS OF STANDARDIZING WHICH MEDIC CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHICH BENEFITS- AND NOW ALSO JUST TURNED- SORT OF REALLY FOCUSING ON ON THE TRANSITION OF INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE SERVICES INTO MANAGED CARE ON A ON A STATEWIDE BASIS- WE TAKE NO ISSUE WITH THE PROPOSED CARBON OF THIS BENEFIT AND DO YOU SEE THE BENEFITS THAT DIRECTOR COOPER- DISCUSSED ALIGNING THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE AND THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS RELATED IN THE SERVICES AND OTHER CALLIN BENEFITS THAT- THAT- THAT ARE PROPOSED. HAVING PLANS BOTH COVER BOTH DAYS BOTH OF THESE SERVICES GIVES THEM THE FISCAL INCENTIVES TO DIVERT UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE PLACEMENTS- THROUGH THE PROVISION OF IMPROVED CORN- PREVENTIVE CARE AND WE'D ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THIS FISCAL INCENTIVE IS FURTHER IMPROVED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO BLEND THE CAPITATED RATES PAID TO PLANS FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH THE DISABILITIES- THAT RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE THAT RESIDE IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WHICH REALLY PLACES PLANS AT RISK- FOR THE LONG TERM CARE STAYS. OF THEIR MEMBERS TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN CURRENTLY- AND THEN LASTLY WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO PROPOSAL TO TIE THE RATES OF- THESE CARVINGS TO- MEDIC HEALTHY FOR SERVICE RATES- UNLESS ANOTHER RATE IS MUTUALLY AGREED UPON- WEEK WE FIND THAT THE POLICY PROTECTS BOTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AS WELL FROM ABRUPT CHANGES TO THE RATES THAT ARE PAID WHICH WE UNDERSTAND HAVE OCCURRED DURING PAST BENEFIT TRANSITIONS- DESPITE THEIR REALLY BEING NO UNDERLYING CHANGES IN IN THE COSTS OF PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES- AND THAT WITH THAT. WITHOUT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE MOVE ON ABBY COURSE ALL- SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS ATTY COURSE ON A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH LAW PROGRAM BASED IN LOS ANGELES OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE THE LOK THE HEALTH RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. AND WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE SERVE AS ONE OF THE SUPPORT CENTERS FOR THE HEALTH CONSUMER LINES. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO THE COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE APARTMENTS WORK ON THE REVISED TELLING PROPOSAL WHICH HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTEEN MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND START MOVING OUR STATE TOWARD REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO STANDARDIZE BENEFITS OFFERED BY MANAGED CARE PLANS ACROSS THE STATE IN CONCEPTS. HAVING ONE SORT OF CARVED IN BENEFITS- FOR THE STATE WILL LESSEN ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDEN FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. I MEAN WILL REDUCE CONFUSION FOR PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES AND PLANS- WE REALLY EMPHASIZE THOUGH THAT TRANSITIONS MUST BE MANAGED CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THE CHANGES DON'T DISRUPT CARE FOR BENEFICIARIES. AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE PASSED BENEFIT TRANSITION TO MEDICARE HAVE NOT ALWAYS PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY AND SOMETIMES HAVE RESULTED IN MAJOR SERVICE DISRUPTIONS AND BENEFITS YEAR IS EXPERIENCING GAS. MANAGING THIS TRANSITION IT CAREFULLY IS REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT'S TIME TO COINCIDE WITH THE UPCOMING OTHER TRANSITIONS INCLUDING BUT CARVE OUT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT JC MENTIONED- AS WELL AS THE CHANGES TO WHO WILL BE MANDATORILY ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE. SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ALL OF THESE CHANGES HAPPENING AROUND THE SAME TIME WILL BE PARTICULARLY CONFUSING. TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION AS SMOOTH WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE MORE DIRECTION TO DCS AND MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT OVER THE TRANSITION. SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFYING STATUTES WHICH BENEFITS WILL BE DELIVERED ON THE MANAGED CARE VERSUS THE FOR SERVICE BASIS. AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ADOPTED A STATUTE AND ADAPT EXISTING PROTECTION FROM ALL PLANNED LETTER EIGHTEEN DASH OH OH EIGHT. AND THE KNOX KEEN ACTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL BENEFICIARIES WHO SERVICES ARE MOVING FROM ONE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. ARE GUARANTEED AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS OF CONTINUITY OF CARE WITH THEIR EXISTING PROVIDER AND THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SOMEONE IS MOVING FROM MANAGED CARE TO FEED YOU FOR SERVICE OR VICE VERSA. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ALSO WORK WITH THE EACH YES TO ENSURE THAT IT. PROVIDES TIMELY ADEQUATE NOTICE AND OTHER FORMS OF OUTREACH TO BENEFICIARIES PROVIDERS AND CAREGIVERS. OF THE TRANSITION AND THE CHANGES FULL OF WELL IN ADVANCE. I NOTICED AN AVERAGE MUST BE CONDUCTED IN ALL THRESHOLD LANGUAGES IDEALLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. FINALLY GIVEN THE MULTITUDE OF CHANGES COMING TO MEDIC HOUSE SAME TIME LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE FUNDING ADDITIONAL CONSUMER SYSTEMS THE MEDIC HOW FISHERIES TO HELP OUR REGION THIS POPULATIONS. AND TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THE UPCOMING CHANGES AND ASSIST THEM IN NAVIGATING THE CHANGES AS THEY OCCUR. WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF RATES- ENSURING PROVIDERS OF BENEFITS ARE MOVED FROM THE FOR SERVICE TO MANAGED CARE PAID AT LEAST THE SAME RATE ARE CURRENTLY PAID. IS A KEY COMPONENT OF ENSURING THAT MEDIC COUNTY TEENS A ROBUST NETWORK OF THESE PROVIDERS. IT'S ALSO CRUCIAL THAT PROVIDERS ACCEPT THIS PAYMENT AS PAYMENT IN FULL AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND DO NOT BALANCE BILL BENEFICIARIES FOR SERVICES. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SEVERAL HISTORIC STEPS TO REGULATE NETWORK ADEQUACY FOR MEDICO. TO ENSURE THE BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO COVER SERVICES AND TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE RULES. THOSE INCLUDE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS OF STACY MENTION FOR SKILLED NURSING AND INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. THE BENEFICIARY SO OFTEN STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THE FULL RANGE OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THEY NEED ESPECIALLY AT HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DIRECT YOU SEE HAS TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING BENEFICIARY ADVOCATES. TO UP A- ADOPT APPROPRIATE NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS FOR THE FULL RANGE OF LONG TERM COMMUNITY. LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC ACCESS STANDARDS. AND MONITOR ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. TO ENSURE THAT ALL BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE ON TO STACEY SOLOMON. A DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR MOUNTAIN SHADOWS. ATM GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND- MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE THIS AFTERNOON. AND TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS SUPPORT THIS PAST YEAR MY NAME IS STACEY SOLOMON I'M THE PRESIDENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NETWORK. AN ASSOCIATION OF SMALL RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS- MAINLY FORTY SIX BEDS TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS OF MOUNTAIN CHAU SUPPORT GROUP AND COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT WHICH IS PROVIDED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO INSTANCE ADOLESCENTS ADULTS SENIORS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES INSTATED WHEN RIVERSIDE OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. OUR SMALL HOMES FORTY SIX BEDS PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERSONAL CARE SPECIALIZED ABILITY SHIN AND DEVELOPMENTAL IN SUPPORT OF HEALTH SERVICES. WE ARE CALLED ICF DD AND AN H. FACILITIES AN OUTDATED TERM USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER OUR HOMES ARE NOT FACILITIES THEY ARE HOMES WE ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES A VALUED COMMUNITY LIVING OPTION. THAT ALSO PROVIDES SPECIALIZED HEALTH CARE IN THE BILL TATIAN SERVICES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND AND THIRTY FIVE ICF HOMES MAINLY FOR SIXPENCE SERVING SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. LOW PROVIDERS. OPERATE ONE OR TWO HOMES THERE THE SMALL PROVIDERS WE ARE 100% RELIANT ON THAT ACCOUNT FOR REIMBURSEMENT MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE DID NOT COVER RESIDENTIAL SERVICES OUR RESIDENTS MAKES IS VERY DIVERSE FROM CHILDREN LIKE TO RURAL BABY ARE WHO LIVES IN ONE OF OUR HOMES IN RIVERSIDE TO SENIORS LIKE RICHARD WHO'S EIGHTY TWO YEARS YOUNG AND LIVES IN ONE OF OUR HOMES AND CBO. WE ADDRESS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS BASED ON PERSON CENTERED APPROACH MOST RESIDENTS LEAVE LIVE IN THE SAME HOME FOR MANY YEARS. WE ARE GOVERNED BY THREE STATE DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT AVAILABLE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE'RE BEING-SWEPT UP INTO CAL IN ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE PAID BY DH CS ON A FEE FOR SERVICES BASIS. AND PROVIDE LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL SERVICES WITH SPECIALIZED ASSISTANCE. FROM A SERVICE PROVIDER AND GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE WE ARE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VALUABLE SERVICE AND REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. OUR RESIDENTIAL SERVICES ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS IS NOT HISTORICALLY AN AREA MUCH MEDIC CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE. THE PROPOSED COUNTING CHANGE AFFECTS FOR MEDICAL RATES AND ALSO AFFECTS FOR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR IT SHIFTS OUR PROGRAM FROM BEING UNDER DEPARTMENT OF JOB DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM TO BEING UNDER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. ANY BROAD MOVEMENT INTO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE REQUIRES A CLEAR AND DIRECT PROCESS AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VITAL SERVICES. AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO ADMINISTER THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH DH CS WHO PAYS A RATES. THIS HAS NOT OCCURRED THERE HAS BEEN NO CAL NO COUNTY WORK GROUP TO DISCUSS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF OUR HOMES FOR THE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RESIDENTS WITH ID THAT WE SUPPORT. WE HAVE SUBMITTED LETTERS TO THE ADMINISTRATION DH CS AND DS LAST YEAR AND AGAIN THIS YEAR WITH DETAILED QUESTIONS. HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ANY MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT REGARDING OUR QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. REGIONAL CENTER REFER PEOPLE WITH ADD TO US BASED UPON OUR PERSON CENTRED PLANNING PROCESS AND WE WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY AND REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATOR TO CHOOSE A HOME. THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS WELL MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS NOW HAVE THIS ROLE. HOW WILL THE CAL IN CRISIS INTERACT THE OVERSIGHT AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. DDS AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. CALENBERG PERSONNEL MAN CARE TO SERVE NEW LONG TERM CARE POLICY TO PURSUE TO. D. H. C. IS. AS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION WE ARE UNCLEAR AND HOW THIS WILL AFFECT OUR SERVICES ARE HOMES AND THE RESIDENTS. I HAVE A HOME MAY HAVE RESIDENTS FROM DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS. UNDER CAL AIN'T THERE WOULD BE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING AT LEAST TWO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND POTENTIALLY SOME FEE FOR SERVICE INDIVIDUALS HOW WILL THIS BE COORDINATED AND WHAT ENTITY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION. OUR MEDICAL RATES CONTINUE TO BE FROZEN AT THE TWO THOUSAND. EIGHT NINE LEVEL WHAT THE TEMPORARY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND A MUCH NEEDED AND APPRECIATED TEMPORARY COVER NINETEEN RATE ADJUSTMENT. I WILL COUNTY AND RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE BEFORE SYSTEM CHANGES OCCUR. STANDARDIZED CONTRACTS STANDARDISED PAYMENT CLARITY ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS ARE ALL NEEDED AND ARE AND ARE ALL PRESENTLY UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR IS HOW NETWORK ADEQUACY FOR THE ICF DD AND ACH HOMES WILL BE DETERMINED. OUR HOMES ARE LINKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES REGARDING THE FUNDING OF DAY PROGRAM AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES RECEIVED BY RESIDENTS RESIDING IN OUR HOMES. THIS ARRANGEMENT GENERATES OVER SIXTEEN MILLION. AND GENERAL FUND ANALYSTS AT THE STATE HOW THIS MAY INVOLVE WITH CAROLINE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE STATE CAN OBTAIN THESE GENERAL FUND REVENUES ANY LONGER UNDER THE COUNTING CHANGES. THESE ARE BUT IF YOU'RE A QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE MANY MORE. YET THERE'S BEEN NO ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND NO RESPONSES TO THE LETTERS WE SENT LAST YEAR MOST OF THIS YEAR. THEREFORE WE ASK THE HOUSE COMMITTEE TO DELAYAYE CFDT N. H. HOMES FROM THE CALTRAIN PROPOSAL UNTIL AFTER A WORK GROUP. UNDER UNIQUE ISSUES HAS BEEN CONVENED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS REPORTED. OUT THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND FIND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE PER OR COMMENTS NOBODY. I HAVE A I HAVE A COMMENT AND THEN I DID THEN IT AND THEN A QUESTION- AND THIS IS JUST- THIS IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO- YEAH MOST MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- HAFTER ENROLL IN A PLAN BY LAW. AND I THINK THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE HERE NEEDS TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE SHIP OF BENEFITS PROPOSING CAL NAME AS PROPOSED TO GRANTING DEPARTMENT BROAD AUTHORITY TO SHIFT BENEFITS IN AND OUT OF MANAGED CARE- I. COMMENT AT THIS POINT- BUT IT'S PRETTY BROAD AUTHORITY AND- I DO I DO GET CONCERNED THAT- THAT AFFECTS HOW THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT INTERACT IN THE FUTURE SO- NOT ASKING FOR COMMENT THIS POINT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST- A CONCERN THAT I HAVE. BUT ALSO I WILL GO TO A QUICK QUESTION AND CONCERN- NOW BROUGHT THE CONCERN BROUGHT UP BY- MISS SULLIVAN- IN THE DESIRE FOR A WORK GROUP HERE- TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF CONCERNS- DO YOU CAN I GET A REACTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT- IS THERE A PLAN FOR A WORK GROUP TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. SO WE DON'T HAVE PLANS FOR A FULL WORK GROUP BUT WE HAVE REACHED OUT OF REQUESTING A MEETING TO DISCUSS OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE REYES WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- ENGINES WOULD KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE AYE CFTC'S CARDEN IN COAST COUNTIES TO DAY. OF INTO WORKING AND LEVERAGING OUR LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT AS WE TAKE THE PROPOSAL- STATEWIDE- AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD A HANDFUL OF CONVERSATIONS INTO THE SPACE BUT WE ARE. A VERY ODD YOU KNOW WEB NO PROBLEM ENGAGING OUR ANSWERING ADDITIONAL QUOTES. THE ACCORD NEEDING IN ENSURING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE- NO NO CHANGES IN REGARDS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING AND IT'S ME THIS TRANSITION OF POSSIBLE- AND- TRULY SOME POTENTIAL BENEFITS IN REGARDS TO- THE COORDINATION- AND REYES ASPECTS REYES DID. IN REGARDS TO THE TRANSITION TO MANAGED CARE STATEWIDE AGAIN IN ADDITION TO WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE A. CARD INTO MANAGED CARE BECAUSE COUNTIES TODAY- WELL I GUESS I GUESS THEN THAT IF THERE IS A NOTE IN THERE THERE'S NO PLAN FOR A WORK GROUP IT. IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE. CORNIA ALL OF AND THAT A LOT OF THEIR LETTERS AND CONCERNS. HAVE KIND OF FALLEN ON DEAF EARS THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS SO WHAT IS THE PLAN IF YOU YOU SAID YOU'RE WILLING TO BUT WHAT IS THE PLAN. TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE- BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE BIG CHANGES- AND- THAT'S WHAT THE REASONS WERE HAVING HEARING HERE TODAY- IS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE SO WHAT ARE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE PLAN TO ENGAGE- WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS. SO WE I BELIEVE THERE'S ALREADY A MEETING ON THE BOOKS IN REGARDS TO MEETING AND HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS- THE- BASED ON THE LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED- AND IF THE MEETING ISN'T ALREADY ON THE BOOKS I KNOW THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO SCHEDULE IT AS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH- YES THEN ON COORDINATING THAT. AND HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE ITEMS REYES WITH A DDS SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LARGE. WORKGROUP WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO. PROVIDE RESPONSES- AND WORK THROUGH ANY OF THE ISSUES- NECESSARY- AND HAPPY TO EVEN REACH OUT DIRECTLY TO MISSILE THEN AFTER THIS MEETING TO ENSURE THAT. I'M SHE AND OR ANY REPRESENTATIVES ARE INCLUDED AND NOT JUST- SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY COORDINATING TO GET THAT MEETING ON THE BOOKS. OKAY THANK YOU AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND- AFTER AFTER THAT MEETING TAKES PLACE AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU TO THE ENTIRE PANEL- MUCH MUCH APPRECIATED- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- HAVE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA INTRODUCE OUR FINAL PANEL. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW HAVE OUR LAST PANEL ON PROPOSED TO STANDARDIZATION OF MANDATORY ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE WILL HAVE FOUR SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH G. C. COOPER FOLLOWED BY BEN JOHNSON. LINDA WAY AND THEN WHEN CHRISSY. TRACY CAN YOU BEGIN PLEASE. OUR AND SO IN THIS PROPOSAL- THE DEPARTMENT IS- PROPOSING YOU STANDARDIZE WHO. TODAY ENROLLMENT IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS IT BURIES BASED ON GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS- THE MANAGED CARE MODEL AND OR VARIOUS EIGHT CODE- THAT THE BENEFICIARIES AND KIND OF DETERMINING WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENROLLED. ON THE CALIPER POSTAL WORKS TO STANDARDIZE WHICH AID- CODE GROUPS WILL REQUIRE MANDATORY MANAGED CARE VERSES- MANDATORY FEE FOR SERVICE ENROLLMENT STATEWIDE. IMPLEMENTATION DOES OCCUR IN TWO PHASES SO TRANSITIONING NON DUAL ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND DUAL ELIGIBLE AND LONG TERM. INSTITUTIONAL POPULATIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE I'M SO BY THE END OF ALL THOSE TRANSITIONS ARE WE ARE PROPOSING. MANDATORY MANAGED CARE IN ADDITION TO OF COURSE THOSE THAT ARE IN THAT CATEGORY TODAY ALL DUEL AND NON DUAL INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. ALL FULL SCOPE PARTIAL AND FULL DUAL EIGHT CODE GROUPS AMERICAN INDIANS HOWEVER WITH NOTES HERE ARE THEY DO HAVE THE OPTION TO- VOLUNTARILY GO TO FEE FOR SERVICE- FOR AMERICAN INDIANS THE FEDERAL RIGHT WHICH WE ARE PROTECTING FOR THEM. AS WELL AS BENEFICIARIES WITH OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE I'M HERE I WOULD JUST NOTE AS WE LOOKED AT OUR DATA OVER 70% OF INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE WERE ALREADY ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE. IN WE HAVE ROBUST A REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO COORDINATION OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE WITHIN OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN SO- WHICH IS WHY WE ARE RECOMMENDING THOSE I MOVED TO MANDATORY MANAGED CARE VERSUS PREVIOUSLY WAS. A VOLUNTARY. AYE BENEFICIARIES LIVING IN ROLES THAT CODE SO WE STILL HAVE CERTAIN ZIP CODES WE HAVE NOT MOVED INTO MANAGED CARE- AND THAT WOULD BURKE- OUTPUT IS AT A STATEWIDE- MANAGED OPPORTUNITIES FOR BENEFICIARIES. AS WELL AS- SOME OTHER POPULATIONS INCLUDING- TRACK- TRAFFICKING AND CRIME FIX A VICTIM ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN ACCELERATED ENROLLMENT- AND A CHILDREN AND HELP- CTP IN THE DEEMING WITH ALSO GO INTO MANDATORY MANAGED. CARE FOR THE POPULATIONS WOULD BE. ON THE- REMAINING AT MANDATORY FEE FIRST IN. BUT INCLUDE RUSHED SCOPE INTO. ARE THAT DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE ON THE SCOPE BENEFITS. I'M SURE CLASS INTO THE- INCLUDING INTO THE AND CO TOWN- WHO ARE HAVE SHARE CALL EXCLUDING. LONG TERM CARE SHARE. UNDER THEN BECAUSE ELLA IS WELL. FOR PREGNANCY RELATED EIGHT CODES WE COOPER TO ALL CITIES. OF EIGHT CO TO FALLS MANY CARE ZERO TWO THREE AND TWENTY TWO PER FEDERAL POVERTY LAW. CURRENT A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM TWO HUNDRED AND- PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WAS CARVED FEW BEEPER SERVICE AND SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING ACROSS THE ENTIRE OF THE PREGNANCY RELATED EIGHT CODES ALL TO BE OUR MANAGED CARE FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP. I GET WOMEN IN RESTAURANTS SCHOOL DO TO ON. IN THE STATUS- WOULD REMAIN IN FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE THE ONLY EXCEPTION HERE IS TITLE TWENTY TWO S. CHIP INDIVIDUALS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN TO THREE HUNDRED. AND 22% FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH WOULD REMAIN IN MANAGED CARE WHERE THEY ARE TODAY SO NO CHANGE FOR INTO PREGNANT WOMEN- WITH UNSATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION STATUS IN REGARDS TO THEIR- I'M ENROLLMENT IN MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE. ADDITIONALLY AS NOTED IN CALAIS AND WE HAVE MADE NO OF PROPOSED CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. IN FOSTER CARE- SERVICES ABOUT CHILDREN YOUTH THEIR- WE ARE CURRENTLY STILL CONVENING OUR FOSTER CARE WORKGROUP WHO'S INFORMING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WORKER GOES THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WILL INFORM THE DEPARTMENT'S FUTURE PROPOSAL REGARDING CHANGES OBSERVED TODAY IT IS STILL STATUS QUO. FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE ON THE WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES BUT I WOULD NOTATE HERE IS THAT THE ENROLLMENT CHANGES ARE BUDGET NEUTRAL- ESSENTIALLY NO- NEXT COSTS OR SAVINGS OVERALL. I'M HOWEVER GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE A CASH BASED BUDGET- YOU WILL SEE SOME- COSTS SCORED IN THE BUDGET- IT TO REFLECT THE CHANGE OF POPULATIONS AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRANSITIONING. POPULATION FROM FEE FOR SERVICE TO MANAGE CARE FOR EXAMPLE- YOU HAVE TO START PAYING THE MANAGED CARE PLAN THE CAPITATION RATE UP FOR THAT TRANSITION IMMEDIATELY HOWEVER- PROVIDER STILL HAVE UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS TO SUBMIT ANY CLAIMS. ON A PAPER SERVICE BASES THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THAT BENEFIT YEAR THE YEAR PRIOR TO THAT TRANSITION- AND SO WE DO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE TYPES OF TRANSITIONS ON A CASH BASIS- SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED. WHEN IT COMES TO CAUGHT OF CARE OFFERED. OF POPULAR THAT ARE CHANGING- TO MANAGE MANAGED. IN A DH CS WILL REQUIRE THAT MEASURE PLAN- CAR OF CARE THE EXIT COVER. OF MANAGED CARE PLANS MUST ALLOW THIS. EVEN IF THE PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS NETWORK- AS LONG AS THE PROVIDER IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE PLAN REIMBURSEMENT RATES- AND THERE ARE NO QUALITY ISSUES THIS IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR EXISTING CONTINUITY OF CARE REQUIREENTS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN WOULD BE REINFORCED THAT THROUGH ALL OF THESE TRANSITIONS OF COURSE THE ACS WILL UPDATE ALL PLAN LETTERS REGARDING THIS AS APPLICABLE TO THIS TRANSITION TO ENSURE. A MANAGED CARE PLANS KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THESE TRANSITION POPULATIONS AND OF COURSE WE'LL DO OUR NORMAL AYE TRANSITIONING MONITORING EFFORTS AROUND. A CONTINUITY OF CARE. UN READINESS BURKE. TO ENSURE PLAN ARE A FOR THE TRANSITION PHD WILL BE RELEASING- AND ALL PLAY LETTER THAT WILL OUTLINE THE GUARDIAN REGARD THE TRANSITIONS- AND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE PLANT TO ANSWERING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AS WE TYPICALLY DO. A THROUGH- THAT ALL PLANNED OUT PROCESS- WE DO PLAN ON ISSUING READY S. DELIVERABLES NO LATER THAN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO PLANTS HAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO PREPARE- THOSE DELIVERABLES- AS WELL AS- ANY OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS SPECIFIC BENEFICIARY DATA- FROM THE FEE FOR SERVICE SO THEY UNDERSTAND. THE TRANSITIONING POPULATION WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN- BE PREPARED FOR THOSE TRANSITIONS. AS WELL AS DH CS WILL BE ISSUING ANY NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FILING- TO ENSURE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO CONSIDER FOR THEIR FILING OF NETWORK ADEQUACY IN TWENTY ONE. BOARD JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING. OF THE DEPARTMENT ALSO. A COMMUNITY OUTREACH PLAN TO INCLUDE VARIOUS- THAT THE IMPACTED BENEFICIARIES WILL RECEIVE COMMUNICATION- SUCH AS MEMBER INFORMING NOTICES REGARDING THE CHANGE OF INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS ON PLAN ENROLLMENT. AND MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHT TO CONTINUITY OF CARE ON THROUGH THE TRANSITION POST IMPLEMENTATION WE WILL IMPLEMENT OUR TRANSITIONAL DAILY MONITORING- AS WELL AS THE ONGOING QUARTERLY MONITORING OF ALL ENROLLMENT TRACK CHANGES. AS WE TYPICALLY DO AS WE ARE CHANGE FROM PEOPLE SERVICE TO MANAGED CARE SURE WE ARE WATCHING THIS I TRANSITIONS CLOSELY. AND THAT WOULD BE- ALL MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM BEN JOHNSON. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD OR EVENING HERE- AGAIN J. WANT TO START BY RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS OF STANDARDIZING- MEDICAL POLICY ON A STATEWIDE BASIS TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN EXISTS TODAY WHERE DELIVERY SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY FOR COVERING I CAN BENEFIT OR IN ROWLEY POPULATION THIS CASE THAT CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF- I'VE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THE FIRST RELATES TO THE PROPOSED TRANSITION OF WOMEN WITH PREGNANCY ONLY COVERAGE TO MANAGED CARE AND THIS RELATES TO WHETHER ROLLING WOMEN. WITH THIS COVERAGE IN MANAGED CARE COULD CAUSE SOME DISRUPTIONS IN THE CARE THEY RECEIVE- TYPICALLY WHEN A NEW MINUTE MEDICARE BENEFICIARY JOINS THE PROGRAM- THEY WOULD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME ACCESS SERVICES THROUGH THE STATE'S FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM PROBABLY FOR AT LEAST A MONTH MAYBE. MAYBE NINETY DAYS AND- AND THEN THEY WOULD TRANSITION OVER OVER TO MANAGED CARE SO AND ROLLING- INDIVIDUAL WOMEN WHO ARE IN COVERAGE FOR ALL- ONE TO TWO YEARS COULD IT IN THAT INITIAL PERIOD. CAUSE THEM TO HAVE TO- POTENTIALLY SWITCH UP A PROVIDER UNLESS- UNLESS CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR THIS UNIQUE POPULATION SO. QUESTIONS AROUND CONTINUITY OF THAT OF THAT LIMITED TERM CARE THE SECOND ONE IS THAT OVERALL- CAL AIM REALLY EXPANDS THOSE THE BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD BE PROVIDING TO THEIR- TO THEIR BENEFICIARIES. AND SO AND- NATURALLY THEN THESE BENEFITS WOULD LARGELY BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ARE ENROLLED IN IN MANAGED CARE. AND THIS LEAVES- THIS COULD LEAVE OUT FOLKS- IN RELEASING THE PROGRAM WHO REMAIN ENROLLED IN THE STATE'S FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM INCLUDING CERTAIN- PRETTY HIGH RISK HIGH NEED POPULATIONS- THE NON. NON LONG TERM CARE- SHARE OF COST SENIORS THE PERSON THAT THIS. AS WELL AS FAR CHIU- WE RECKON THE A WORKER CAN. ON ALL. HOW IMPROVE CARE FOR FOSTER AND SO DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKGROUP BUT AS THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO DELIBERATE CALLING WAIT WE JUST RECOMMEND THAT SOME THOUGHT BE GIVEN TO- HOW- THESE NON MANAGED CARE POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO SHARE IN. MANY OF THE NEW BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT CALLING WOULD CREATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LINDA WAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER OF HOME LAUNCH POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN LED THE WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT ADEQUATELY CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING. AN EVALUATION OF THE POPULATION SPECIFIC PLAN READY NEXT CRITERIA. SHARE AND GRAYSON THIS MOMENT PASSED FOR INDIVIDUALS OR CARE DOES NOT WORK. FOR MAKING ANY CHANGE DIRECT TENER. TO AND IN AN ACCOUNT CARE PLAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FIRST. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POPULAR AND PROPOSED TO MOVE AND WHAT YOU NEEDS THAT. HAS AND HOW THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE BENNETT. NEED UNTIL EARNED THEM. WE UNDERSTAND THAT HAS EITHER RUN I NEVER COLLECTED AND CONTINUE TO REQUEST BE SURE PUBLICLY. PRIOR TO ANY. THE MUST ENSURE THAT IT TO APPLY READING IT ABOUT YOU EACH THE BEACH FOR COPY. AND AUTHORIZED THE CHANCE TO BEGIN UNTIL IT IS INSURED THE PLANT NETWORK ARE ADEQUATE TO. NEED TO DOUBLE. AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE DEPARTMENT TIMELINE OF TRANSITIONING FROM POPULATION AS EARLY AS NEXT JANUARY DOES NOT ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO CONDUCT THE REQUISITE. THAT LEVEL OF READINESS REVIEW AND AS A RESULT SOME BENEFICIARIES MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS IN CARE. THE DEPARTMENT MUST ALSO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE TRANSITION TO THE% AFFECTED POPULATION AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE AS OUTLINED BY AND COURSE OLD TESTAMENT WHICH INCLUDE NOT MAKING CHANGES FOR PEOPLE NAY PREGNANCY. DURING SOMEONE WHO ROLLED IN PREGNANCY MEDICAID HEALTH JULY AND IT DUE TO DELIVER A BABY NEXT MARCH SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO CHANGE DELIVERY AND MET. IN JANUARY. WE ALSO QUESTIONED THE NEED TO TREAT PREGNANT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MOVING ALL BUT CERTAIN IMMIGRANTS NTO MANDATORY MANAGED CARE WILL HAVE. ON THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY GIVEN THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING THE PRIVACY OF THEIR INFORMATION. WE ALSO REQUEST COMMUNITY CARE PROTECTIONS THE INFECTION FOR ALL NEWLY ENROLLED MEDICAID MANAGED CARE MEMBERS. WHO REQUEST COMPANY NEED CARE THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO BE PROVIDERS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS FOR THE COURSE. OF THEIR TREATMENT. FINALLY BASED ON HALF TRANSITION WE KNOW THAT MANAGED CARE DOES NOT WORK FOR ALL MEMBERS. THE REQUESTED THE MOMENT PROTECTION HE SAID THAT YOU AND NOT BE. OVERLY BURDENSOME NUMBER. NO CAL ENROLLEES WITH UNSTABLE COMPLEX CAN. THAT ARE LIKE. SHOULD THE CHOICE TO STAY OUT OF MANAGED CARE WITHOUT A TIME LIMIT. ON THAT ACCOUNT AND RELEASED LEVIN MEDICALLY SUPPORTED REASON TO STAY MANAGE CARE. SUCH AS NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE RIGHT NATIONALIST SHOULD BE ABLE TO REQUEST AN EXTENSION. AT ANY TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM LYNN KERR C. WITH THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ACCESS. AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS LYNN PERCY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS IN LOS ANGELES IT'S A DIRECT SERVICE AND POLICY ORGANIZATIONS CELEBRATING TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON GIVEN OUR GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS AND COUNTING TO SWITCH TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS FROM SERVICE TO MANAGE CARE DURING PREGNANCY. AND FOR CHILDREN. WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO IMPROVE SERVICES FOR ALL CHILDREN AND PREGNANT PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS THEIR- STARTING WITH SWITCHING INTO MANAGED CARE DURING PREGNANCY THE PERSON'S OF SOME ESSENTIAL PERINATAL SPECIALTY CENTERS AND HOSPITALS UCLA CEDARS HUNTINGTON PASADENA ONLY ACCEPT. MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE LOSING ACCESS TO THESE INSTITUTIONS AND SPECIFIC CLINICS OFFEND THEM ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES. SECONDS AT THE SERVICES TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DURING PREGNANCY THROUGH THE COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL SERVICES PROGRAM ARE MORE READILY AVAILABLE IN MANY CASES WHEN MEDICARE OUT ISN'T THE FOR SERVICE. ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IS A STATED GOAL HELLO A- DEFECT ON THE A DOCUMENT IS THE UNDOCUMENTED HUSBAND STATED BY THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS ONLY IN THIS PROPOSAL ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED MAY REMAIN IF YOU FOR SERVICE DURING THEIR PREGNANCIES. THIS REDESIGN A PREGNANCY RELATED MEDICARE PROGRAM TO COVER ONLY UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS. BUT UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROGRAM. FOR THIS THE GROUP TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DISTRACT TO BROWN IT WOULD GRANT EACH YEAR THOR TERM MEDIC MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ON ANY TYPE OF PRESUMPTIVE XCELERATED PROGRAM AS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT. FINALLY THE CALIBER CLOSE WOULD MAKE ACCESS TO A MIDWIFE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT ALREADY IS BECAUSE MIDWIVES ARE NOT ADEQUATELY CONTRACTED MEDICARE MEDICARE DEPARTMENT POLICY PREVENTS PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH AS FEW AS ONE NURSE MIDWIFE ONE LICENSED MIDWIFE. AND THIS RATIO IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. MOVING TO CHILDREN- CURRENTLY CHILDREN ARE TEMPORARILY ENROLLED THE ACCELERATED AT THE MOMENT THEY RECEIVE THEIR MEDICARE ON THE FOR SERVICE AND ONE FINAL MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO PROVE UP TO FORTY FIVE DAYS LATER. THE FAMILY THEN HAS ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS TO SELECT THE PLAN PROVIDER UNDER THE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS PROCESS. WE COUNTY PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE MANAGED CARE ENROLLMENT MANDATORY DURING THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF THE FOR SERVICE. THIS WOULD MEAN A FAMILY COULD HAVE AS MANY AS FORTY FIVE FEWER DAYS TO ACCESS PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS TO GET EXPERIENCE WHICH PLANS AND SUPPLEMENTS SUBGROUPS OF PROVIDERS. AND YOU KNOW THE LAYERS COMPRISE THE BEST NETWORK FOR THEIR THEIR CHILDREN. A CHANGE OF THIS KIND SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNDER THE COVER OF CALTRAIN. WITHOUT PROVISIONS- FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO. FOCUS GET COME SORRY WITHOUT. THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FOCUS INPUT FROM AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. SIMILARLY CALLIN ALSO PROPOSES TO MOVE CERTAIN INFANTS BORN TO MOM ON MEDICARE OUT FROM PAPER SERVICE TO MANAGED CARE IN THE MONEY INTO THE MOTHER'S MEDICAL PLAN WHEN THE FAMILY SEEKS TO PREVENTIVE CARE CHECK UP. THIS WOULD COMPLETELY BYPASSED THE MANDATED HEALTH CARE OPTIONS PROCESS AND MAKE THIS CHOICE FOR THE FAMILY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FAMILY WOULD CHOOSE ANOTHER SUPPLIER NOT. FAMILIES WE GET NO PRIOR NOTICE THAT THEY NEED TO CHOOSE A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER OR WHAT WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY WANT TO MOVE A NEW FOR TWO DIFFERENT PLANTS. THESE CONCERNS ARE BASED ON ACTUAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ENROLLING INFANTS INTO PLANS WITHOUT EVEN GIVING PRIOR NOTICE TO THE FAMILY ABOUT THE PLANET ROAMING. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WE HELPED A FAMILY OF A NEWBORN WITH INFECTIONS. AND A COLLAPSED LUNG. AT SIX DAYS AND UNIT INTENSIVE CARE YOU. THE DEPARTMENT. ROLL THE INPUT INTO THE MOTHER'S PLAN WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO THE MOTHER OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT. AN APPROPRIATE PLAN PROVIDERS AS A RESULT THE END BUT MISSED. OUR NICK YOU FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS IT TOOK SIX WEEKS TO GET THIS VERY VULNERABLE IN FACT. ASSIGNED TO THE PEDIATRICIAN SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE. A POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS IS ADOPTING MANAGE PAPER SERVICE SOMETHING CALLED MANAGEMENT FOR SERVICE FOR PREGNANCY RELATED MEDICAL. CONNECTICUT HAS DONE THIS FOR ITS MEDICAID RECIPIENTS ALL THE WHOLE STATE TO GREAT SUCCESS. ROBUST OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE EVIDENCE BASED AND FEDERALLY FUNDED C. DSP PROGRAM AND MANAGED CARE. FOR THIS. C. S. B. WITH HOME TO SUCH PROGRAMS BECAUSE POSTPARTUM VISITS WHICH ARE HEATERS ARE QUALITY MEASURE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS. HAVE NEVER BEEN ADEQUATE IN THE PLANTS BUT- MET 8290% BUT A HOME VISITORS INVOLVED. AND FOURTH REMOVING BARRIERS TO THE PARTICIPATION OF MIDWIVES AND MEDICAL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TOWARD THE SUBMISSIONS. AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT CONCLUDES THIS PANEL I WILL LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST I JUST WANT YES THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR AND JUST A COUPLE- SO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HEARD. A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN ABOUT. HER FROM THE L. A. O. AND A COUPLE OF OUR WITNESSES ABOUT CONTINUITY OF CARE. AND THE SWITCH. THE FOR SERVICE TO MANAGED CARE. I LIKE TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO COMMENT ON THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW ONCE YOU START IN A SYSTEM. WHERE YOU KNOW PREGNANCY IS A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME SO WHY NOT YOU KNOW GRANDFATHER THAT PERSON IN AND LET THEM STAY IN THAT PROGRAM. RATHER THAN TRANSITIONING TRANSITIONING THEM AND WE HEARD YOU KNOW ALSO CHEN CHALLENGES WITH LANGUAGE AND SO ON SO WHY WHY THE DESIRE TO- TO SWITCH YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THEIR PREGNANCY ALREADY ALREADY IN THEIR PREGNANCY TO IT TOO. TO A PLAN IF THEY'RE IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE SO JUST TO BE CLEAR AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IN OUR PROPOSAL BUT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THOSE THAT. ARE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT BE TO TRANSITION SOMEONE DURING THEIR PREGNANCY- IT WOULD JUST BE THAT OUR FUTURE FORWARD INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLING IN. THE PROGRAM- AFTER THAT THAT DATE OF JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT THEY WOULD. IMMEDIATELY GO INTO MANAGED CARE VERSES IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT AND SO INTENTION IS NOT TO DISRUPT SOMEONE'S OUT CURRENT PREGNANCY BUT TO SET A FUTURE- REQUIREMENT AROUND. MANDATORY MANAGED CARE FOR THE POPULATION- AS WELL AS I'M REALLY JUST FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT- CURRENTLY. THERE IS JUST A ONE OFF BEFORE THE POPULATION THE 1-003-822-0013 PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LETTER IS THE ONLY ONE- WITHIN THE- LOCKLEY. PRESIDENT OF THE- POPULATIONS AT LEAST- BUT WITHIN VIEW FOR SERVICE ALL OF THE OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY IN MANDATORY MANAGED CARE JUST TO BE CLEAR. OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH- WITH PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES- AND- COORDINATION OF THOSE SERVICES I'M IN WOULD JUST KNOW THAT WE DID NOT PROPOSE THE CHANGES. IN THE- IN THE INDIVIDUALS WITH NON SATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION STATUS BASED ON STAKEHOLDER. FEEDBACK IN REGARDS NOT CHANGING OF THAT POPULATION SO WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING- THE ITEM AND YOU HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT AGAIN. I'M NOT LOOKING TO DISRUPT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY PREGNANT I SETTING POLICY FOR FUTURE ENROLLMENTS INDIVIDUALS JOINING- THAT. MEASURE BROWN. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT IT TAKE IT I DON'T THINK IT WAS ENTIRELY CLEAR- WITH OUR STATE CALLED THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE COMMENTING SO- SO THIS IS QUESTION- THAT- MY CAR MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE OFF THE WALL BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE'S NOTHING DO PREGNANCY BUT IS THE QUESTION IS THAT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE FOSTER USE MANAGED. CARE WORKGROUP. SURE WE HAVE THE- MET A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE MEETING FOR JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THEN WE WOULD TAKE BACK THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONVERSATIONS- LEARNINGS FROM THAT. A FOSTER CARE WORKGROUP AND DEVELOP A PROPOSAL THAT WE WOULD PUT OUT- BEFORE AGAIN HER COMIC ID RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T PUT OUT A PROPOSAL IN REGARDS TO FOSTER CARE- WE ARE TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION WORK WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS- AND SO WE WOULD ENGAGE PEOPLE ON ANY FUTURE PROPOSAL IN REGARDS. TO ANY TRANSITIONS OR CHANGES FOR FOSTER YOUTH IN THE FUTURE. I JUST NOTE THAT BECAUSE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- REQUIRES DHS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. TO IMPLEMENT A SPECIALIZED CARE MODEL. BUT YOU JUST SAID THE WORKGROUP HASN'T FINISHED MEETING YET SO. SO THAT. THAT THAT SPECIALIZED CARE MODEL WILL COME AFTER THE FACT WE WON'T REALLY SEE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE. IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE GOING TO APPROVE THIS. IT POTENTIALLY IN THE BUDGET BUT WE WON'T SEE WHAT THAT MODEL LOOKS LIKE UNTIL IT'S COMPLETED AFTER THE FACT HE SAID LATE JUNE SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WE ARE ALREADY WORKING DETECTS A DSS AND DHHS HAVE PARTNERED ALREADY. TO HAVE A FOSTER CARE WORKGROUP WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT JOINTLY- FOR MANY MONTHS. WE'RE CONTINUING THE WORK GROUP FOR THE FEEDBACK ON WHAT THAT MODEL WOULD LOOK LIKE THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THAT'S JUST GATHERING INFORMATION. AFTER THAT WE WOULD COMPILE- THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS DO DATA ANALYTICS DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR FOSTER CARE WHICH WE WOULD THEN ENGAGE BOTH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN REGARDS TO ANY PROPOSED CHANGES BEFORE WE IMPLEMENT. ANY OF THOSE CHANGES- WE DO NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME AND WITH FULLY ENGAGE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND LEGISLATORS REGARDING. ANY FUTURE PROPOSAL AROUND FASTER YOU. SO WILL WE GET A OPPORTUNITY THAT BEFORE IT'S IMPLEMENTED THEM. YES YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FULLY ENGAGE IN OUR PROPOSAL- ONCE WE DEVELOP ONE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU OKAY THE TO THINK. WITHOUT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SIX PANEL AND ALL OF OUR PANELS WE WILL NOW TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT- THE NUMBERS WERE AVAILABLE EARLIER BUT I WILL REPEAT THEM NOW THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. SEVEN THREE TWO SIX TWO FOUR TWO. WITHOUT OPERATOR CAN WE HAVE OUR FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT. OPERATOR ARE YOU THERE. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY PERFECT- I WOULD DETAIN NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THE ABOUT THAT COMMAND ONE MORE TIME ONE. ZERO IN OUR FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT COMES FROM LINE THIRTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS SHERIN REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING CAL AINSLIE'S FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR THOUSANDS OF BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE AGREE WITH IN THIS WAY THAT WE NEED A MEDIC CAL BENEFIT TO SOME OF THE UNIQUE SERVICES NEED TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WITH THE BENEFIT WE CAN INSURE MANY THOUSANDS OF BENEFICIARIES COULD RECEIVE THE RIGHT SERVICES OFFERED BY ENTITIES THAT HAVE COMPETENCY AND SERVING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE TO SUPPLEMENTAL PER MEMBER PER MONTH FREE. IN LIEU OF SERVICES WILL LIKELY ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY HOMELESSNESS. WITH POTENTIAL IN EQUITIES AND HOOK IT SIR. THESE SERVICES WILL BE OFFERED DIFFERENTLY BY PLAN AND SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL IN ANY COUNTY. THE BILLING AND CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS ARE LIKELY TO INCLUDE MANY OF THE ENTITIES MOST CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES. AND MANY OF THE ASSEMBLY ENTITIES ARE CULTURALLY SPECIFICS. FINALLY PLANTS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES AND IDENTIFYING AND FINDING BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. RESTRICTING HIGH HOW IOS ROLLS OUT. WE URGE THE COMMITTEES TO JOIN OVER FIFTEEN OTHER STATES TO INCLUDE A BENEFIT THAT CAN TRULY OFFER A WHOLE PERSON EQUITABLE APPROACH TO BENEFICIARIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALAIS.

GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MIGHT EXACTLY WARM UP PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT THE DOWNTOWN WOMEN'S CENTER LOCATED SKINNER LOS ANGELES AS THE NATION'S FIRST PROVIDER OF PERMITS BUT ACCOUNTING FOR WOMEN DO YOU HAVE YOU SEEN KNOWS FIRST HAND THAT SERVICES THAT ASSIST HOUSING PEOPLE AND THEN KEEPING THEM HOUSED FOR CENTRAL TO ACHIEVING ANY STABILITY BUT PERSONAL HEALTH. ENHANCING FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PORT SERVICES IS ALSO A CRITICAL COMPONENT TOWARD SOLVING HOMELESSNESS COUNTY PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO FUNDING SERVICES THROUGH A BENEFIT STATE OF THREE WITH THE SERVICES IT BENEFIT WOULD ALLOW OFTEN HUNDREDS OF OTHER PROVIDERS TO SCALE UP FUNDING FOR HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES BUT MOST OF THAT FUNDING COMING FROM WASHINGTON. THE CALENDARS INTENDED TO SERVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS THE PROVISION FOR THIS POPULATION THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WILL ONLY COVER CARE COORDINATION WHICH IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE WHILE PEOPLE ARE STILL EXPERIENCING HOPELESSNESS OR HOUSING INSTABILITY. AND FUNDING HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES THROUGH THE IN LOW SERVICES PROVISION WILL RESULT IN VERY FEW BENEFICIARIES THINK SIR IN FACT UNDER TALENT WILL IT SHOULD BE LOSING RESOURCES FOR CRITICAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THESE REASONS WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LIKE FIFTEEN OTHER STATES CAN OFFER A HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES BENEFIT. PLEASE CONSIDER INCLUDING IN THE COUNTING BUDGET AND AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR DH CS TO DIRECT ADDITIONAL CALLIN RESOURCES GRADING HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICE BENEFIT RATHER THAN INCLUDING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND YOU SEE A BENEFIT OR IOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE INCENTIVE TO APPEAR TO BE GEARED STRICTLY AVENUE IN LET'S START WITH THAT RATHER THAN ENSURING THAT EXISTING NETWORKS FOR CURRENT SERVICES ARE SUFFICIENT USING INCENTIVES TO ADD NEW SERVICES WHILE IGNORING THE BASED PROVIDER NETWORK IS NOT APPROPRIATE THE COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF THE INMATE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THE CALENDAR TOTAL.

ESPECIALLY THOSE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FULFILL THE EXISTING EPS FIFTY REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDREN PARTICULARLY IMPROVING THE LOW PREVENTIVE CARE RATES FOR MEDICAL CHILDREN. WHAT IS MISSING AND POORLY NEEDED IS THE EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM NAMELY FINANCING. THESE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE TYPED PAYMENT. FIRST INCENTIVE PAYMENTS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR BASIC CARE COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE THE WAY INCENTIVES WERE PROPOSED FOR ECM. SECOND THERE SHOULD BE A MINIMUM SPEND FOR PREVENTIVE CARE REQUIRED FOR MANAGED CARE CAPITATION PAYMENTS ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN. FINALLY RATE SETTING SHOULD BE TIED DIRECTLY TO QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RACIAL EQUITY NOT JUST TO EFFICIENCIES AND UTILIZATION. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF UNDER UTILIZATION AND ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE NOT JUST THE COORDINATION AND EFFICIENCY OF CARE FOR COMPLEX CONDITION.
