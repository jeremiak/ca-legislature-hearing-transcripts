PLEASE GIVE ATTENTION AS YOUR HOLDEN MISTER HOLDING YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE WAY. FOR A VERY IMPORTANT CHAGES AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IN ADDRESSING WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE TODAY 2%. TEN FIFTY FOUR NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT. OF WILDFIRES ON OUR STATE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HAVE INFLICTED ON THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. THE COST TO TO CODE TO CUSTOMERS. AND THE IMPACT ON SOLVENCY OTHER PROVIDERS A POWER FOR ALL OF US. CLIMATE CHANGES CREATED A NEW REALITY. UNDER THE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE. THE STATE'S FIRE SEASON AND AS I ALMOST YEAR ROUND. MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA WILD LANDS ARE CLASSIFIED AS UNDER VERY HIGH. OR EXTREME FIRE THREAT. APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT'S ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THAT HIGH RISK AREA. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS IGNITING AN EXCESSIVE BUILDUP OF DRY BRUSH. FROM POUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN SOME AREAS BUT INCREASING OCCURRENCES OF HIGH WINDS. AND LOW HUMIDITY IS INCREASING CONTACT BETWEEN UTILITY LINES AND TREES BECAUSE IN A CONDITION. EXACERBATING THE FURTHER BY DEAD AND DYING TREES [inaudible] THE RESULT. FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WHETHER THE UTILITY WAS APPROVED MANAGER. OF ITS EQUIPMENT OR NEGLIGENT OPERATOR. UTILITY OPERATOR EXPOSURE TO GREATER LIABILITY FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IS BECOMING THE NORM. AND MORE OF OUR NEIGHBORS THE VICTIMS OF THE DEVASTATION. COSTS EXCEEDING INSURANCE PROTECTION. DOWNGRADING OF CREDITWORTHINESS AN INCREASING POTENTIAL FOR BANKRUPTCY AS COMPROMISE THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SAFE. RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR UNPRECEDENTED SAFETY INVESTMENTS BY THE I. O. USE. WITHOUT PROFITS FOR SHAREHOLDERS. FOUR CHAU USED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR WHILE FIRE SAFETY RECORD. AND PERFORMANCE AND PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND TAXPAYERS FROM HOLY BEARING THE COST. OF THESE JUST DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THIS BILL. ALONG WITH SB. ONE ELEVEN WILL FACILITATE CUSTOMER ACCESS TO SAFE. RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER BY PROVIDING A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CPUC. NO LATER THAN JANUARY TWENTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DIVISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY. WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. PROCEEDINGS AND CREATE A NEW PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. AND ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE FUNDING MECHANISMS TO CAPITALIZE THE WILDFIRE FUN. THIS PACKAGE OFFERS A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. WITH NO INCREASE IN ELECTRIC RATES FOR CUSTOMERS FROM WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. THE PACKAGE PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR CUSTOMERS WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FIXED. BY THE BILL IT PROVIDES CERTAINTY FOR THE MARKETS TO PREVENT THE UTILITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE SOUTH. AND PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR FIRE VICTIMS. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ON THIS BILL AND IN CONCURRENCE. INCIDENT AMENDMENTS AND IMMEDIATELY AND ROLL AND TRANSMIT TO THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU MISS HOLDEN MS BURKE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. IT SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO CREATE A FUND FOR FUTURE FIRES. WITHOUT THE INCREASE IN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES THIS BILL WOULD REALLY ONLY SERVE AS A TEMPORARY FIX TO WHAT HAS NOW PROVEN TO BE. AN ONGOING PROBLEM. AND TO ADDRESS WILDFIRES IN THE STATE MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE AND RESULT IN REDUCING CATASTROPHIC FIRES FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. WITH REGARD TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UTILITIES I USE LOVE TO SPEND FIVE BILLION IN AGGREGATE ON FIRE SAFETY AND MITIGATION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND SHAREHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN OUR PROFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. ENCOURAGING INCREASED WELFARE SAFETY SPENDING AND HIGHER UTILITY SAFETY STANDARDS THAT REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WILL RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE STATE AND TO THE CONSUMER. ADDITIONALLY IF THIS BILL SUCCESSFULLY REDUCES FUTURE FIRE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK UTILITY CREDIT RATINGS CAM REMAIN STABLE AND EVEN IMPROVE. ACCORDING TO THE LA LOW. EVERY TIME THE BOND RATING AGENCIES DOWNGRADE THE UTILITIES THERE IS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE COST OF BORROWING FOR THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS. WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED RATE INCREASES THIS IS BECAUSE OF OUR MONEY IS GOING TO SERVICE DEBT. IN ADDITION TO SAVING CONSUMER MONEY THIS BILL TAKES STEPS TO DISH CREASE THE CHANCES OF FUTURE FIRES. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR CREATES A SAFETY CERTIFICATION WITHIN THE NEW CREATED WHILE FIRE SAFETY DIVISION AND ADVISORY BOARD. THAT REQUIRES UTILITIES TO TIE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO SAFETY PERFORMANCE CREATE A SAFETY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. COMPLY WITH THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND PASS A SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT. FURTHERMORE THE BILL WE'RE CREATING NEW PRUDENT STAND MANAGER STANDARD THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE FOR STANDARD TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY TO THE UTILITIES. I TO JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE WELFARE SAFETY VISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE PC. AND INTO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WHICH WILL HELP ASSURE THAT ALL LIKE TRIPLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS REVIEWED AND ASSESSED BY SPECIALIST. FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING BEST PRACTICES FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION. THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL BE COMPRISED OF EXPERTS IN FIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY WILL BE MORE NIMBLE TO RESPOND TO CHALLENGES AS THEY ARISE. THE PROVISIONS OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND IT'S CAMPAIGN BILLS WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEAST OFFER SAFE AND AFFORDABLE POWER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ENDEAVOR TO MINIMIZE AND PREVENT UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT WILDFIRES THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES LOST THEIR HOME. I'M MORE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THERE'LL FOR THEIR LIVES TO REGAIN A SENSE OF NORMALCY. OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A STATE TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF THESE WILDFIRES ON ALL PARTIES CONTINUES TO GROW. ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FIRE SEASON. MEMBERS MAKE NO MISTAKE HOUSING AB TEN FIFTY FOUR IS A PIVOTAL STEP BUT IT IS NOT THE LAST STEP. WE STILL HAVE MANY MORE ISSUES TO CONTEND WITH. THERE ARE THOSE IN THIS ROOM WHO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT TO ADDRESS THE OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUES FACING VICTIMS. THOSE WHO WISH TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND HOW BEST TO ADDRESS THINGS LIFE RELIEF FOR AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY LARGE ENERGY USERS HOME HARDENING. UNDER INSURANCE ASSURANCE AVAILABILITY ALL STILL WITH EYES TOWARDS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN VICTIMS. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN OPEN TO THOSE ISSUES ITEMS AND WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. FOR THOSE WHO SAY WHY NOW [inaudible] WHY TODAY? I SAY I HAVE SEEN THE COST OF INACTION. AND WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE DEVASTATION. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG WITH THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORT SHOULD BE ON THE PAST FEW AND FUTURE VICTIMS. AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO APOLOGIZE TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THESE ARE BURDENS THAT WE ALL PAY FOR NOT TAKING PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DEMANDED LONG IN ADVANCE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS WHO HAVE BEEN OUT OF THEIR HOME FOR OR TWO OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE PHONE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. FORCED TO LISTEN AS THE FIRE OVERTOOK THEM. AND ENDED THEIR LIVES. WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. AND TO NOT ACT TODAY WOULD BE UNCONSCIONABLE. SO WE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ACTION. AND THIS IS AN ACTION IN WHICH WE REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY NOT JUST FROM US BUT FROM THE UTILITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO BEHAVE POORLY. A LOT HAS GONE INTO THIS. I WANT TO THANK THE JOINT AND CO AUTHORS FOR THEIR DEDICATION OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TO AN ISSUE THAT HAS NO SIMPLE OR EASY SOLUTION. YES THIS FINAL PRODUCT IS FAIRLY NEW BUT WE HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. THIRTY SECONDS OVER THOSE IN OPPOSITION OR THE NEWSPAPER TRYING WITH THE WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T PUT TIME AND EFFORT IN THIS YOU ARE WRONG. MEMBERS I WENT TO PARIS AND SAW THE DEVASTATION I SAW YOUNG KIDS WERE NOT ONLY RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA BUT ALSO AFRAID THEY WILL NEVER GO BACK HOME. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ACT. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS IS OUR JOB. WE WERE SENT TO SACRAMENTO TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS. I KNOW THIS WON'T BE AN EASY VOTE FOR SOME OF YOU. BUT IT IS THE RIGHT. ONE IT'S A VOTE THE CAN PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECOMING VICTIMS NOT ONLY THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION THE WILDFIRES CAN CAUSE. BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF UTILITY COSTS AS WELL I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IBM. DAVIS BURKE MISSED GRAYSON YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN REFERENCE TO AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ROOT OF THE WILD FIRES THAT TRAGICALLY BURN THROUGH OUR STATE. I BELIEVE THAT WE AS POLICY MAKERS MUST HAVE AT LEAST THREE PRIORITIES TO GUIDE US AS WE EMBARK ON TAKING ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION. ONE THAT THE FAMILIES VICTIMIZED BY THESE FIRES RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. TO ENSURING THAT RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED IN THREE MAKNG SURE THAT RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES ARE NOT BEARING THE BURDEN OF BLAME THAT BELONGS ON THE BACKS. OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES WHO MADE DECISIONS THAT PUT OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF EXPERIENCING THESE MEGA FIRES. THIS LEGISLATION STRIKES AS CLOSE TO A BALANCE AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO ENSURES. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION TARGETS HOWEVER WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HOW ENERGY PRICES INSTABILITY AFFECT OUR BROADER ECONOMY. ENERGY COST HAVE A KNOCK ON INSTITUTIONAL USERS OF ENERGY. AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN GABRIEL VALLEY TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF ALL VARIETIES TO WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEED TO STABILIZE UTILITIES. I DO ASK HOWEVER THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN A ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH THE LARGE USERS OF ENERGY. SUCH THE LIKE OUR STATE'S MANUFACTURERS TO BE ABLE TO FIND LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP THEM REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. BOTH NATIONALLY AND GLOBALLY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING MORE ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. THANKS GRAYSON MS LAMONT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM A DISTRICT IMPACTED BY THE THOMAS FIRE AND SOMEONE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT SB NINE A ONE LAST YEAR I RISE TO SPEAK ON AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR TWENTY TWO MONTHS AGO THE THOMAS PRIOR FIRE BROUGHT DEVASTATION TO MY DISTRICT ON A SCALE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE. BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE OF NUMEROUS FIRES THAT HAS CHANGED THE WAY WE LIVE. WHEN THE ISSUE OF WILDFIRES AND NATURAL DISASTERS CAME BEFORE US ON THE FLOOR? I FIND MYSELF THINKING OF THE COUNTLESS VICTIMS THAT HAVE YET TO BE MADE WHOLE. WHEN I TAKE THESE VOTES I THINK OF THE VICTIMS? IN MY DISTRICT AND THE FUTURE POTENTIAL VICTIMS. I AM SUPPORTING AB TEN FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE IT IS A FIX THAT COMES CLOSEST TO PROTECTING WILDFIRE VICTIMS RATE PAYERS AND HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. THIS BILL REQUIRES UTILITIES TO MAKE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENSURE VICTIMS CLAIMS ARE SETTLED IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS THESE COSTS FROM BEING PASSED DOWN TO REPAIRS. IT HELPS REDUCETHE OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES BY HOLDING UTILITIES TO A HIGHER SAFETY STANDARD AND REQUIRES THEM TO TAKE ACTIVE STEPS TO ACHIEVE THOSE STANDARDS INCLUDING. STRENGTHENING INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND HIGHLIGHTING MANAGEMENT'S ROLE IN FOSTERING A SAFETY CULTURE. IT INCENTIVIZE IS UTILITIES TO ESTABLISH AN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE THAT PROMOTES SAFETY AS A WHOLE AND SHIFT EXECUTIVES FOCUS TO MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON SAFETY AND NOT PROFIT. AND ITS STABILIZERS REPAIRS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TEN YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY I'VE KNOWN MY COMMUNITY I'VE BEEN I'VE NOT KNOWN MY COMMUNITY WITHOUT WILDFIRES WHICH MEANS THAT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE EXPERIENCE THE DESTRUCTION OF ANOTHER. ONE FOR THIS REASON I DO NOT TAKE THIS VOTE LIGHTLY. SINCE DECEMBER FOURTH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WITH MY COLLEAGUES THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES IN COMMITTEE IN SMALL GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATION. THIS MEANS WHAT THIS MEANS FOR MY DISTRICT AND THE ENTIRE STATE NOT ONLY TO DATE AND FOR YEARS TO COME IS IMPORTANT IN MY DELIBERATION. THIS BILL PROVIDES FUTURE WHILE FIRE VICTIMS BETTER CONFIDENCE THAT DESPITE THE LOSS AND DEVASTATION THERE IS RELIEF AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS EMMA. DOCTOR WOULD. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR THE WILDFIRE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE PLAYED -- TO PEOPLE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. NEED OUR HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT NOW. WE WANT -- TO MOST IMPORTANTLY MAKE SURE VICTIMS OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRES ARE COMPENSATED. WE WANT TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS AND WE WANT TO STABILIZE THE AND UTILITY MARKET AND I'M THANKFUL TO OUR COLLEAGUES -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD FOR THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION I WORK ON THIS -- THE GOVERNOR'S WORK ON THIS -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WE DO THIS. IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD. AND MORE IS NEEDED -- TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE I TO HAVE LIVED THE WILDFIRES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WITH -- WHEN THE FIRE STARTED IN LAKE COUNTY -- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ONE ONLY ONE IN TEN FIRES WILDFIRES IS STARTED. BY UTILITY. NINE OUT OF TEN OR NOT. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAR FIRE THAT WAS STARTED BY A OF A MALFUNCTION OF A CALL OF A OF A CAR IRONICALLY -- YOU LOOK AT THE THE LAKE COUNTY FIRES OR START BY PEOPLE WORKING ON ON OFFENSE AND SOMEONE WORKING ON A ON A HOT WATER HEATER. THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE HISTORY THE STATE THE RANCH IN THE RIVER FIRE COMPLEX UP IN MENDOCINO IN IN LAKE COUNTY LAST YEAR. STARTED BY SOMEONE DOING RANCH WORK. SO THESE ARE THESE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THESE PER PREVENTION. WE GOT OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE DIE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IN THESE FIRES WE DON'T NEED ONE MORE PERSON TO DO THAT. THE PREVENTION AND ESPECIALLY IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. BECAUSE IT ULTIMATELY WE DON'T HELP PEOPLE PREVENT THESE FIRES BY HARDENING THEIR HOMES IN INCREASING DEFENSIBLE SPACE. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT US ALL. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT OUR INSURANCE MARKETS. PEOPLE ARE LOSING INSURANCE AT A AT A AT A REMARKABLE RATE WE'RE BEING FORCED ON TO THE FAIR PLAN WHICH WHICH MAKES THEIR INSURANCE RATES GO UP VERY VERY HIGH. WHICH MEANS IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SELL A HOUSE WHICH MEANS IS DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE TO BUY THAT HOUSE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR INSURANCE. THAT TRAIN IS COMING DOWN THE TRACKS AND THAT IN AND OUT AND AND WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH WITH THAT AS WELL BUT I THINK WE DO IT BY PREVENTING A RISK AND PREVENTING -- THESE FIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE TO STABILIZE AT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING IN ADDITION -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE -- WE'RE NOT DONE FOLKS -- THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD. AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT I ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A HIGH FIRE RISK AREA. THIS ISSUE IS OF MAJOR CONCERN TO MY DISTRICT. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF JARGON IN RECENT WEEKS ABOUT UTILITY MARKETS GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS BOND HOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND MORE. BUT WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. IS MAKING SURE WE TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON US TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON PEOPLE WHO RELY ON US TO PROTECT THEM FROM WILDFIRES. THE PEOPLE WHO LOST EVERYTHING IN OUR STATES RECENT FIRES. AND WE TAKE CARE OF THE MALL HERE. FOR CONSUMERS THEIR CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE RELIABLE ELECTRICITY WITHOUT PAYING HIGHER RATES. FOR CALIFORNIANS IN FIRE PRONE AREAS THERE ARE A GROUNDBREAKING SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO PREVENT NEW WILDFIRES FROM UTILITY EQUIPMENT. AND FOR FIRE VICTIMS THERE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE MADE WHOLE BEFORE P. JEANNIE WILL BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. SO LET'S FORGET ABOUT INVESTORS AND COMMISSIONERS AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE ONES WHO REALLY MATTER. THE ONES WHO ELECTED US WHO WE ARE HERE TO LOOK OUT. FOR FOR THEM I ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU. NAME IS WALDER MISTER VOEPEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I SELDOM RISE WHICH IS PROBABLY GREATLY APPRECIATED. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THIS BILL I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT NEED TO BE EITHER APPROVED OR A FOLLOW ON BILL IN THE FUTURE NEEDS TO MATERIALIZE. WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE IS THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE? IN THE FUTURE THOUGH WE MUST LOOK TO RISK MITIGATION. IN INSURANCE TERM FOR TRYING TO MITIGATE YOUR WRISTS. AND ALSO WE NEED TO LOOK AT LIMIT TEEN LAWSUITS RIGHT NOW IN THE HIGH FIRE AREAS MANY PEOPLE GO WITHOUT COVERAGE OR GO WITH LESS COVERAGE. BECAUSE OF AFFORDABILITY BY DEFAULT THAT MAKES THE I. O. USE THE INSURER OF CHOICE. BECAUSE THESE LAWSUITS OF THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. SHOULD BE COVERED GREATLY BY THE HOMEOWNERS THEMSELVES THROUGH A PROPER INSURANCE PROGRAM. OUR FARE PROGRAM FOR THE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T QUALIFY. FOR THE CORRECT INSURANCE NEEDS TO BE REINFORCED [inaudible] AND FINANCED AT A HIGHER LEVEL. HOW WE DO THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT DOWN THE ROAD? AND THEN FINALLY. AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS BRAGGING. BUT OR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. OF GRID MANAGEMENT. AND PUTTING IN MONITORS THROUGHOUT. OUR AREA IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ALMOST EVERY MOUNTAIN TOP HAS SENSORS. WE HAVE SATELLITE WE GO INTO THEIR WEATHER CENTER AND THEY CAN. CONTROL THEIR DREAD DOWN TO VERY SMALL AREAS THEY ALSO HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS TO GO IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE GRID. SO THAT SENIORS AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT CAN HAVE THE PROPER ENERGY SOURCES FOR THEIR OXYGEN EXCEPT A SO. A LOT CAN BE DONEBY P. G. AN E.. I AM ONLY MENTIONING S. D. G. AN E. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT JUST THE THE MARK FOR CALIFORNIA BUT PROBABLY FOR ALL THE WILD FIRE AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND I WOULD LIKE -- TO ALSO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT EVEN THOUGH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IS DONE A GREAT JOB. THE MITIGATION STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF MY DISTRICT AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM ESCONDIDO -- MY DISTRICT GOES FOR THE MEXICAN BORDER UP TO BRAVE ASIDE AND WAY UP INTO -- THE HINTERLAND UP THERE. I SELDOM GET THERE. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT IS FORREST GUMP WOULD SAY. THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL MS RACE [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA ISN'T IN THE BUSINESS OF BAILING OUT PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. BUT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA FINDS ITSELF IN THE POSITION REGARDING UTILITIES. AND THEIR STABILITY. THAT REQUIRES ACTION NOW. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. I STRUGGLED WITH THIS I'VE HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL NOT ONLY ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF IT WHAT ABOUT THE TIMELINE THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN TO TAKE ACTION. LAST YEAR WE PASSED SB NINE OH ONE AFTER HOURS AND HOURS OF HEARINGS. AND STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. WE MADE HARD CHOICES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGE AND WORK TO PROTECT VICTIMS REDUCE FUEL LOADS. AND PROVIDE A PATH FORWARD TO THOSE UTILITIES THAT HAVE MADE THE CHOICE TO ACT RESPONSIBLY. NOW BEFORE AS WE ARE FACED WITH A DIFFICULT CHOICE. A CHOICE THAT FORCES US ALL TO REMEMBER. WHY WE WERE ELECTED WHY WE ARE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? I DID NOT COME TO SACRAMENTO TO REPRESENT WALL STREET OR TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. I WAS ELECTED. I WAS SENT HERE TO REPRESENT MY DISTRICT A TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS [inaudible] THIS PROPOSAL. WITHOUT A DOUBT ALL FIRST ABILITY TO UTILITIES. IT OFFERS A PAL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN GOOD ACTORS. TO ALLOW THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THE VICTIMS THE RATE PAYERS AND THE WORKERS. BUT IT ALSO OFFERS A POUND FOR THOSE. WHO HAVE BEEN BAD ACTORS? IT ALLOWS THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE. ALLOWS THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. AND TO PROVE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY. AND TO ENTER A FUND [inaudible] THE PROVIDES. FOR THE STABILITY THAT THEY NEED PROVIDES A PROTECTION FOR THEIR WORKERS. FOR THE RATE PAYERS. AND FOR THE VICTIMS. IN THE END. OUR JOB IS TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA. AFTER MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WITH THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR CREATES THE CONDITIONS AND THE STANDARDS. TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA. AND TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF PGA ANY. THAT IS WHY IN SPITE OF MY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE THAT FAILING TO ACT TODAY MAY BE WORSE THAN THE STATUS QUO. AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR I BELIEVE IS A BEGINNING. AND THAT IT WILL PROTECT OUR RATE PAYERS IT WILL PROTECT OUR FIRE VICTIMS. IT'LL PROTECT OUR WORKERS. AND THAT IS THE REASON. WHY I WAS ELECTED TO BE HERE AND THAT IS THE REASON I AM ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION TODAY? THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDRESS MR BLOOM. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO JOIN IN THE CHORUS OF THOSE WHO ARE. SUPPORTING THIS IN AN IMPORTANT MEASURE. OF WHEN I WAS A A YOUNG CHILD GROWING UP NOT FAR FROM -- THE WHERE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL LIVES -- ONE OF MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTIONS -- IS WATCHING A FIRE -- CLIMB UP THROUGH THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS TO THE BASE OF THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND TO FURTHER FURTHER UP VERY VERY RAPIDLY TOWARDS MOUNT WILSON THAT WAS A LARGE FIRE THERE AND BUT IT STUCK IN MY MIND AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT YEARS LATER -- I WOULD BE EXPERIENCING FIRE AFTER FIRE AFTER FIRE AND THAT'S SO -- THE REMARKABLE THING THAT WE FACE TODAY IT'S NOT THAT FIRE EXISTS BUT IT'S THE INTENSITY AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY ARE OCCURRING. I'M IT IS. PRETTY INCREDIBLE TO TO WATCH THIS DEBATE AND SEE HOW MANY MEMBERS FROM AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE GETTING UP AND SAYING. THERE WAS A FIRE IN MY DISTRICT AND MY DISTRICT WAS AFFECTED AND IN THE FOLLOWING WAY AND THAT'S WHAT. A FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN MEANT WHEN HE SAID THAT THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL -- THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE STATEMENTS THAT I THINK REALLY GALVANIZED US AND BEGAN. MOVING US FORWARD TOWARDS WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT THIS IS A CONTINUING. OF WHAT WE DO TODAY IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION -- WE NEED -- TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE LEGISLATING ON THIS ISSUE BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE BUDGETING AROUND FIRE AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AROUND ADDRESSING. THE THE URBAN INTERFACE THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FOR US -- THERE ARE SO MANY SO MANY THINGS -- MY DISTRICTS MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH WITH FIRE AFTER SEEING IT IN BEL AIR IN BRENTWOOD -- IN PACIFIC PALISADES OF MULTIPLE MULTIPLE FIRES IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS THE MOST RECENT FAR WAS THE WILL THE FIRE -- WHICH WAS A DEVASTATING FIRE -- TOOK OUT HUNDREDS OF HOMES -- AND WE LOST TWO LIVES IN IN THE WORLD THE FIRE. I IT IT IS. FOR THOSE PEOPLE I AND IN THE HOPES THAT WE WILL NOT SEE THAT AGAIN BUT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE PROBABLY WILL -- THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. MR LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE EFFORT THAT HAS PUT INTO THIS BILL. BUT IT'S BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BY. MY FELLOW LAWMAKERS BY THE STAFF AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ACHIEVE LAUDABLE. GOALS HOWEVER. CONSIDERABLE EFFORT AND GOOD INTENTIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY LEAD. TO SOUND POLICY WHEN A PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY OF THAT POLICY HAS AN EGREGIOUSLY BAD RECORD ON PUBLIC SAFETY. AND CORPORATE STORAGE SHED. YESTERDAY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PUBLISHED A REMINDER TO ALL OF US. OF P. GENIES LET ME OF NEGLECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN. ITS INFRASTRUCTURE. THE ARTICLE DETAILED P. GENIES WILLFUL NEGLECT OF TRANSMISSION LINE EQUIPMENT THAT IGNITED THE CAMPFIRE LAST NOVEMBER. AND HOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER LINES INCLUDING THE IGNACIO MARE ISLAND LINE. THAT EXTENDS THROUGH MARIN COUNTY. THAT IS PART OF THE SAME CARRABELLE THE LOAN A SYSTEM WITH POWER SPEAKING BACK. TO NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THAT ARE IN SERIOUS NEED OF REPAIR. AND PGA ANY HAS KNOWN ABOUT IT. BUT THOSE REPAIRS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED TIME AND AGAIN. IN FACT P. GINNY PERK FIRST PROPOSED WORK ON THE MARIN LINE AN EXTRAORDINARILY FIRE PRONE REGION OF THE COUNTY IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THIS WORK HAS YET TO COMMENCE. THESE TOWERS ARE AS OLD AS NINETY EIGHT YEARS SIMILAR TO THE TOWER THAT FAILED. IN THE CAMP FIRE RESULTING. IN EIGHTY FIVE DEATHS. THEY KNEW EACH IN A NEW AND THEY DID NOTHING. THEFAILURE OF THESE LINES IS NOT A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE WAITING TO HAPPEN IT IS A CATASTROPHE THAT WILL HAPPEN. AGING IS RECORD OF NEGLECT PROVES THIS OUT. YOU'D THINK AFTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN PGA ANY. WOULD HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE DANGER AND SUBSTANTIATED FEARS. THAT FUTURE FIRES CAUSED BY NEGLECT COULD COST THE LIVES. OF MANY MORE. HOW COULD THEY NOT? HOW COULD THEY NOT? YOU'D THINK THAT AFTER THE NIGHTMARE EXPLOSION THAT KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE IN SAN BRUNO IN. TWENTY TEN BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EVENT THAT HIGHLIGHTED. THE NEED FOR A NEW FOUND RESPECT FOR SAFETY FOR UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE. BY P. JEANNIE HOWEVER EARLIER THIS YEAR. MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO A P. YOU SEE REPORT ON P. GENIES MALFEASANCE REGARDING THE LOCATION OF ITS SUBSURFACE PIPELINES FOR EXCAVATION CRUZ. TO OPERATE SAFELY. AT CONSTRUCTION SITES FORMER PC COMMISSIONER CATHERINE SAND OF ALL CALL THE REPORT'S FINDINGS. DISCUSS DEAN AND DEEPLY APPALLING. EIGHT PEOPLE DIED IN THAT EXPLOSION BACK IN SAN BRUNO AND THEY STILL DIDN'T FIX. THEIR PROBLEMS. WHAT PROMPTED ME TO INTRODUCE AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX WITH WHICH THIS? HOUSE PASSED THIS YEAR TO BOLSTER THE PIPELINE LOCATION OF OCCASION PROCESS WE SHOULD DO THE SAME. TO BOLSTER TRANSMISSION LINE SAFETY. WE SHOULD DO THE SAME MEMBERS I HOPE THE DISGRACEFUL PAST A PUBLIC SAFETY NEGLECT. AND THE MURDER OF INNOCENT LIVES IS NOT A PROLOGUE TO FURTHER P. GINNY RELATED DEVASTATION. IT IS HARD NOT TO SEE THIS BILL AS SOMETHING. OF A REWARD FOR MONSTROUS BEHAVIOR. THEY HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK THEY SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED. OUR EFFORTS SHOULD MAKE PUBLIC SAFETY PARAMOUNT. IF WE ARE TO ENTRUST THIS BILL WITH BEING A CORNERSTONE. OF TRUE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. LET IT ABSOLUTELY BE THE LAST TIME YOU DO. IF THAT CHANGE DOES NOT OCCUR I CERTAINLY WILL NOT MY VOTE IS NOW. THANK YOU MISS LIVING IS PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY FOR THE REPAIRS OF MY DISTRICT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO WE ALL REPRESENT AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED? THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT AND THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT OVER. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE COST OF INACTION TODAY IS SIMPLY TOO HIGH AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE MUST ACT. WE MUST ACT NOW NOT TO STABILIZE THE UTILITY MARKETS BUT TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA. AND TO PROTECT OUR WITH RATE PAYERS AND YES TO STABILIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL MARKETS OF OUR STATE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT WE DO A BETTER JOB OF ALIGNING THE INCENTIVES FOR OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO THAT THEY IN PARTICULAR. LEE P. JEANNIE THEY ARE INCENTIVIZED TO ACT PRUDENTLY TO ACT RESPONSIBLY ANDTO MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS THE PROTECT THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS WE MUST ALSO. AS THIS BODY. DO A BETTER JOB IN OUR ROLE AS PROVIDING OVERSIGHT FOR THESE UTILITIES NOW AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO. I JOIN TODAY IN THE CHORUS OF SUPPORT FOR AT TEN FIFTY FOUR AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE COME BACK. THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE CONTINUE TO DO A BETTER JOB. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISS PETRIE-NORRIS MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. WOULD LIKE TO THANK. EVERYONE THIS WORKED HARD ON THIS BILL I SPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR LEADING THIS EFFORT. TO PUT TO THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON IN FRONT OF US HERE TODAY. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD. IN THIS BILL THERE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THOUGHT A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE THAT WORKED REALLY HARD. TO PUT TOGETHER THIS BILL. THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS IN MY MIND IS WHETHER. WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IF WE HAD MORE THAN TWO WEEKS DID THE PAID THE DETAILS. OF THIS BILL [inaudible] LAST YEAR. WE WERE TOLD THAT IF WE DIDN'T PASS -- SB NINE A ONE BY IMMINENT DEADLINE. THAT SHE KNEW WAS GONNA GO BANKRUPT. AND SO WE JUMPED AND WE PASSED SB NINE A ONE THEN FOR IT THEN PREVENT. ANY DIFFERENT GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY. BUT WE DID OUR BEST [inaudible] NOW. WE'RE BEING ASKED. TO PASS THIS BILL. AND IF WE DON'T PASS IT ACCORDING. TO THE GOVERNOR IF WE DON'T PASS IT BY JULY TWELFTH. THEN. EDISON IS GOING TO BE DOWNGRADED TO JUNK BOND STATUS AND THEY MAY FACE BANKRUPTCY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SEE THAT PATTERN [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] SO THAT. IT INFORMS US. AS WE GO FORWARD WITH ALL THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE. THE END. MY BIGGEST CONCERN. THAT I SHARE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS IS THE WEAKENING OF THE PROJECT MANAGER STANDARD. THIS ONLY PROTECTS RATE PAYERS. AND I CONFIRM THIS DURING OUR UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE HEARING YESTERDAY THIS ONLY CAPS THE INCREASED COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS AS LONG AS THE FUN LAUGHS. WELL FOLKS. AS OUR CHAIRMAN. OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE STRONGER OFTEN IS PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL TALK ABOUT. TEN OF THE WORST WILDFIRES IN THE HISTORY OF THE SANTA CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN JUST IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND NOW. AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AND SO IT. WE FACED A PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY JUSTIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND NOW THE PROJECTION IS AT THIS FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND IS GOING WAS IS GOING TO LAST US FOR TEN YEARS. DO THE MATH. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PACKAGE TOGETHER AND ADDRESS. AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE INVOLVED IN THIS AND THIS [inaudible] CRISIS HERE. I CAN SHARE. MY CONCERN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ABOUT. HOW THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE WERE ASKING RATE PAYERS TO PAY AND WE'RE ASKING UTILITIES TO PAN WHERE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES? THEY'RE NOT PART OF THIS DEAL. INSURANCE COMPANIES. NEED TO BE STEPPING UP. TO ADDRESS. THIS COST CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING. AND WE ALSO HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF STRICT LIABILITY. I KNOW THAT THAT'S ON POPULAR ESPECIALLY FOR MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT. PAGE YOU NEED JURISDICTIONS. BUT IT I I THINK. THERE NEEDS TO BE GROWING AWARENESS THAT RATE PAIR ADVOCATES LIKE TURN SUPPORT. INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS LIKE THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL SUPPORT INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM [inaudible] WE CAN'T. ESPECIALLY WITH THE WEAKENED PRUDENT MENACED STANDARD THAT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE UTILITIES TO PASS WHAT FAR COST ALONG TO RATE PAYERS. WE CAN'T KEEP ASKING RATE PAYERS TO BEAR THE EVER INCREASING COSTS OF WILDFIRES. SO I JUST WANT [inaudible] TO EMPHASIZE. HOWEVER THE VOTE TURNS OUT TODAY. THAT THIS BILL IS JUST BUYING TIME. I CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET WORSE. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF UNFINISHED WORK TO DO. MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO US SUPPORT. IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SENATE AMENDMENTS. MONEY JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS HERE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS IS WELL BALANCED. THE RATE PAYERS PAY NO MORE IN FEES OR IN RATE INCREASES THEN THEY PRESENTLY DO THIS DOES NOT TOUCH. RATE INCREASES NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO IT IT PROVIDES AN UNPRECEDENTED. TEN ALMOST ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE UTILITIES. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS. ARE NOT JOSH STE. BACK IN WALL STREET. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS IN A FOR A ONCE AND IN THEIR RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. ARE EXPOSED. TO UTILITY INVESTMENTS. WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A SECOND OR A THIRD. MAJOR UTILITY BEING UNDER THE KIND OF STRESS. OF THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING. TO DEAL WITH HERE PRESENTLY. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A CENTRAL. FOR US TO TAKE THIS STEP. BUT OTHER MEMBERS HERE TAKE SAYING ADDITIONAL STEPS AS WELL. AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT -- BUT SERVED ON THE UTILITY AND ENERGY. FOR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS THIS IS CLOSE TO ME. FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AND I COMMEND OUR CHAIR FOR THE WORK AND THAT HE'S DONE. ON THIS. BUT I COME AT THIS ALSO. AS SOMEONE. WHO REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? HAS TO START GETTING. THE KINDS OF RESOURCES AND THE KINDS OF EFFORTS IN C. INTO IT THAT WE GET THESE FIRES PUT OUT EARLY AND THAT THEY DO NOT EXPLODE. MEMBERS WE HAVE SEE ONE THIRTIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING ON LINE WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER RETARDANTS. SUBSTANTIALLY -- IN THE FUTURE WE ARE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING PRE POSITIONING. ALL ON A REGULAR BASIS OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS THE THE THE TRUCKS SEE IT SPARK WE CAN GET RESOURCES TO IT. QUICKLY. I HAVEN'T IN THIS. ALMOST SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE I HAVE NOT SEEN A MORE FOCUSED. SERIOUS CONCERN ON WHAT DO WE DO NOW. THIS IS A STEPPING POINT FOR STABILITY. INSTABILITY COULD VERY WELL MEAN. BANKRUPTCY FOR ALL OF THESE UTILITIES. AND THAT WOULD BE. A TERRIBLE OCCURRENCE. FOR RELIABILITY FOR RATES -- AND FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY. MEMBERS WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET. WE ARE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS INTO THE A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY M.. DUST CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY GRID IS. SOMEWHAT DISINTEGRATING IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. AND WE HAVE SEEN RELIABILITY ISSUES AND WE HAVE SEEN COST ISSUES. THAT HAVE DRIVEN SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD. THIS KIND OF EXPENSE. IT ONLY GETS WORSE IF THE GRID CONTINUES. TO DE TO TO TO BE. TO START FALLING APART AND I KNOW THIS SOUNDS A BIT [inaudible] DRACONIAN. MEMBERS WE HAVE A GRADE ISSUE. AND WE HAVE A STABILITY ISSUE. AND WE HAVE A FINANCE ISSUE. AND DOING NOTHING. IS A CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL JUST SEE THE PROBLEMS IN THE PGA ANY SERVICE AREA. IN A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN I WANT TO A CLOSE WITH A UP A PERSONAL [inaudible] PLAY. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ALSO STANDING UP AND SAYING WE GOT TO DO A WHOLE WHOLE LOT MORE. IN MANAGING OUR FOREST AND GETTING THESE DEAD TREES OUT WE HAVE FUEL. ARE THAT ISN'T. THE UTILITIES BALK LYING ALL OVER OUR FORESTS AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THOSE THAT MATERIAL OUT. AND WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR FORESTS MANAGED SO THAT THEY DO NOT EXPLODE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR FORESTS FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY HAD SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TREES. TO THE ACRE WE NOW HAVE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED TREES TO THE THEIR TENDER BOXES WERE READY TO EXPLODE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIGHT FIRES IN A MUCH. BIGGER MORE BROADER MORE ROBUST WAY WE'VE GOT TO MANAGE OUR FORESTS. AND THEN I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS I HAVE MY DAUGHTER MY SON IN LAW TO OF OUR FOUR GRAND KIDS THEY LIVE AT THREE THOUSAND FEET UP IN THE FOREST AREA OUT OF OUT OF BASS LAKE. AREA [inaudible] THEY'RE FRIGHTENED. THEY'RE AFRAID THEY HAVE EXIT PLANS AND THEY LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD BE NEXT. DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. I HOPE TO GOD WILL HELP SAVE NOT ONLY MY LOVED ONES. BUT YOUR LOVED ONES AS WELL SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS PATTERSON DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR ME TO ASK. YES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR OTHER NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY. MY COLLEAGUES THAT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. FIRST OF ALL WHY DID SB NINE A ONE FAIL. IT'S BECAUSE WE GAVE THE P. YOU SEE THE AUTHORITY. AND THE PRESIDENT PICKER THE P. YOU SEE SAID -- RE READ NINE NO ONE WE DIDN'T THINK IT REQUIRED US TO ACT. THAT CAUSED A DISASTER THIS BILL DOES NOT DEPEND UPON THE P. YOU SEE. AND IN FACT. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE NEED TO GET P. G. NEED TO REPAIR THEIR LINES. AND FRANKLY IF WE HAD TO DEPEND UPON THE P. YOU SEE IS NON. AS NON WORKING AS IT IS NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE SETTING UP A SEPARATE SAFETY -- DEPARTMENT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY. GO OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO ENFORCE THAT SAFETY. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS FAR SUPERIOR TO NINE A ONE BECAUSE WE WE ARE BYPASSING THE P. YOU SEE -- AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET. P. JEANNIE AND THE OTHER UTILITIES TO UPGRADE THEIR LINES. FINALLY THERE'S A QUESTION OF THE FUN DURABILITY. AND TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT IT IS AND HERE'S WHY. IS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS NOW. THAT THE UTILITIES ARE TURNING OFF THEIR WIRES WHEN WE GET HI FIRE. OFF -- DAYS HIGH FIRE PROPENSITY DAYS WHEN EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS A DRY DAY WITH HIGH WINDS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES THE LINES WERE TURNED OFF. FURTHER WE'RE WORKING ON MANAGING OUR FORESTS AND TAKING MANY OTHER PROACTIVE STEPS THIS -- FUND WAS LOOKED AT BUY. A CONSULTING GROUP. TO SAY WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO STABILIZE THESE UTILITIES WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO HELP OUT THE VICTIMS THIS IS A NUMBER THEY CAME UP WITH. NOT LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE DONE BUT WHAT WE WILL DO. I URGE EVERYONE TO SUPPORT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK THAT PURPOSE CUNNINGHAM. YOUR RECORDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND P. GENIES CONDUCT WE ALL TRUSTED THEM FOR DECADES. WE TRUSTED THEY WOULD INVEST IN SAFETY AND HARDEN THE GRADE AND THEY LET US DOWN. WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT WE CAN ONLY DEAL. WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DEAL WITH THE FUTURE. AND IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN THEN I SUGGEST YOU NEED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BECAUSE IT FORCES THEM IF FORCES ALL THE UTILITIES TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO HARDEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO UPGRADE THE GRID AND WHAT LET'S PUT A HUMAN FACE FOR SECOND ON BANKRUPTCY. IT HAS A TOLL IT MEANS DELAYED COMPENSATION FOR FIRE VICTIMS. IT MEANS WORKERS RUN CERTAIN ABOUT THEIR PAYCHECKS. IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IT MEANS. THAT DOWNSTREAM COMPANIES ARE AT RISK OF BANKRUPTCY IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S THE TOPAZ VALLEY SOLAR POWER PLANT. THAT FACILITY AND THE OWNERS THAT FACILITY THE SECOND P. JEANNIE WENT BANKRUPT. THE SECOND THEY WENT BANKRUPT THE OWNERS OF THAT FACILITY. THEY WERE DOWNGRADED TO JUNK BOND STATUS. BECAUSE OF P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY. WE CANNOT SITE SOLAR POWER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRESENTLY. THAT'S A PROBLEM FOLKS. WE'VE ENACTED SOME VERY VERY AMBITIOUS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS IN THE STATE AND TO GET TO EIGHT TO BE AND REACH THOSE GOALS. WE NEED INDUSTRIAL SCALE SOLAR WE NEED OFFSHORE WIND WE NEED ON SHORE WHEN WE NEED RENEWABLE POWER. AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BANKRUPT UTILITY. YOU HAVE NOBODY TO BUY THAT ENERGY AND DISTRIBUTED. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. SO LET'S CONSIDER THE HUMAN TOLL I BELIEVE. THE RISK TO THE OTHER UTILITIES ISRAEL. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION. THIS BILL FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR NINE A ONE I VOTED NO. AND IF YOU TOLD ME THAT. THIS BODY WOULD COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT WOULD PROTECT REPAIRS WOULD GET. COMPENSATION MORE QUICKLY TO FIRE VICTIMS. WOULD FORCE THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN HARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WOULD DO ALL THAT. AND STABILIZE THE ENERGY MARKETS SO WE CAN SAID ABOUT. PROVIDING POWER CHEAP CLEAN AND SAFE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED YOU. BUT THEY DID IT. AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THERE WAS CUNNINGHAM AND MISTER MAYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- AS A A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR OF AB AT TEN FIFTY FOUR I'M I'M OBVIOUSLY -- IN SUPPORT OF IT. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO'S NOW SERVED IN THIS BODY GOING ON MY FIFTH YEAR WHICH SEEMS LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE A LOT LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN ALL. BE PROUD OF IT IS NOT PERFECT I THINK IT'S ALL BEEN SAID IN FACT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY MORE ARGUMENTS ON THE MERITS OF THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARGUMENTS HAVE ALL BEEN SAID -- BUT I DO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF UTILITIES SO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR HIS STEADY HAND ON HIS SHARP MIND IN HIS FINE WORK AS HIS LEAD. THEY'RE ALL OF THIS I ALSO WANT TO PRAISE NOW COLLEAGUE FROM -- FROM INGLEWOOD WHO IS DONE TO COME A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON THIS AS WELL AND I ALSO WANT TO PRAISE -- THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM FOR THE SERIOUSNESS THAT HE'S PUT IN A TO THIS MEASURE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. THIS IS NOT ON THE FAST TRACK AS IT'S BEEN SAID. I WANNA REMIND SOME OF YOU THAT IT WAS JANUARY OF LAST YEAR THAT MANY OF US BEGAN WORKING ON THESE ISSUES IN TWO DIFFERENT. WORKING GROUPS ONE LED BY. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM INGLEWOOD ANOTHER ONE LED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF UTILITIES WE SPENT HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS STUDYING THIS ISSUE AND THEN WE ENDED UP ON THE NIGHT A ONE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. AND ENDED UP SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS WORKING ON THIS ISSUES THEN WE KNEW AT THE TIME WHEN THE NOT A ONE OF COMMITTEE REPORT WAS DONE THAT IT WASN'T FINISHED IN THAT THERE WAS MORE WORK THAT HAD TO BE DONE. THIS YEAR. WE HAD THAT WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR AND THE NEW GOVERNOR WANT TO WORK RIGHT AWAY TO START TACKLING THIS ISSUES. AND WE CAN REMEMBER THAT IN APRIL HE HAD HIS STRIKE FORCE REPORT THAT WAS THAT WAS PUT OUT. AND THEN WE ASK THEN I DON'T COMMISSION TO FINISH THEIR WORK UP AND THEY DID AND THEY PUT A VERY COMPLETE. WORK PRODUCT TOGETHER THEY ENDED UP. THE LA -- ENDED UP PUTTING A WORK PRODUCT OUT OUT AS WELL IN ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE IN THIS BILL WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT. THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT BUT IS THE BEST THAT WE ALL COULD COME UP WITH THIS IS A WORK. OF OF COMPROMISE IS A WORK OF COLLABORATION IT WAS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TOGETHER. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MESS MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I WILL I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OF THIS LEGISLATION -- WHO HAVE LED SOME VERY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS IN THIS LEGISLATURE? AT THROUGHOUT THIS YOU'RE GOING TO LAST YEAR. ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. SOME OF WHICH ARE IN THIS BILL. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I'M PRETTY TORN UP. BY THIS LEGISLATION I'VE BEEN STEWING ABOUT IT ALL WEEK. AFTER ALL OF MY COMMUNITY HAS BEEN THROUGH OVER THESE LAST EIGHT MONTHS [inaudible] HOMES. BUSINESSES LOST WHOLE COMMUNITIES WIPED OUT. EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE KILLED. WE'RE PRETTY TORN UP ABOUT THIS BILL. NGUYEN P. JEANNIE DECIDED TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IN JANUARY IT WAS A PUNCH IN OUR GUT. RATHER THAN ALLOW THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO PROCEED. AND TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR ACTUAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS WERE THEY DECIDED TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. NOT OUR CHOICE LIKE THE DECISION TO DELAY MAINTENANCE. ONLINE'S WAS NOT OUR CHOICE. JUST LIKE THE DECISION TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS. AND BONUSES TO EXECUTIVES TO THE VERY EXECUTIVES WHO MADE THESE TRADE OFFS. WAS NOT OUR DECISION. WE NEW BANKRUPTCY. WHAT IT MEANT FOR US? THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS ON THIS COMPANY WOULD BE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. THAT'S WHAT WE KNEW. AND WE HAVE COME TO THE VERY HARD REALIZATION THAT THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN AN INEPT UTILITY. IS A BANKRUPT. ONE WHAT DECISIONS AS MY COMMUNITY GET TO MAKE. HOW TO REBUILD FROM THE ASHES? WILL BE AFFORDABLE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET INSURANCE. HOW DO WE FIX CONTAMINATED WATER? WHERE DO WE GO UNTIL THEN HOW DO WE PREPARE? REPAIR DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT MY TO MY COMMUNITY GETS TO MAKE. HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR POWER SHUT OFFS? THESE ARE ALL TOUGH DECISIONS WITH NO EASY ANSWERS. SO WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT'S ANOTHER TOUGH DECISION FOR ME. A HOBSON'S CHOICE DO I DEAL WITH THE DEVIL THAT I KNOW. FOR THE DEVIL THAT I DON'T. IF WE LET IT ALL CRASH DOWN IT WOULD BE JUST DESSERTS. FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN AS NEGLECT NEGLIGENT AS THIS. ONE BUT WOULD IT BE FAIR FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. AND I'LL USE THAT SERVE THEM. TO SEE THEIR CREDIT DOWNGRADED IT TO SEE MORE BANKRUPTCIES. WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS? THE LINEMEN IN THE FRONTLINE WORKERS. THEY LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRE IS TIRELESSLY TO RESTORE POWER AND TO KEEP THE POWER ON THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GO OUT. IN THESE DISASTERS IN THE STORMS. MAKE SURE IT'S ON SHOULD THEY PAY THE PRICE FOR THE BAD DECISIONS OF HIGHER UPS. FOR P. JEANNIE MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BANKRUPTCY. MAYBE THEIR ASSETS SHOULD BE SOLD. TO SOMEONE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND WHO WOULD OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY MAYBE A BREAK UP WOULD BE BETTER. BUT I KNOW THAT MANY WHO ARE ROOTING FOR THIS BILL TO FAIL. WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER P. JEANNIE. AND IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORSE THAN BIG GOVERNMENT ARE SORRY BIG BUSINESS. IS BIG GOVERNMENT. IN FACT GOVERNMENT IS THE REASON THAT WE IS P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS PAY THE HIGHEST BILLS. IN THE NATION. AND ALL THE WHILE WILD FIRE VICTIMS WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY MISS OUT. AND THAT'S THE BEST NEWS IT'S IN THIS BILL. IT PROBABLY MOST EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGES THIS COMPANY TO DO RIGHT BY THE WILD FIRE VICTIMS. IF THEY WANT THE BENEFITS OF THIS INSURANCE FUND THEY HAVE TO PAY THE VICTIMS AND COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. BY NEXT YEAR NO DRAGGING THEM ALONG FOR THE RIDE. BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IN THIS BILL THAT THE I. O. USE IN THEIR SHAREHOLDERS WILL PAY INTO THAT FUND. ONLY IF THEY ELECT. TO AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT LOST ON ANY OF US THAT P. JEANNIE RIGHT NOW IS ASKING FOR A RATE INCREASE. FROM OUR RATE PAYERS. P. JEANNIE ALSO PROMISES THAT SHAREHOLDERS WILL PICK UP. THE COST OF PAIN VICTIMS. THERE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD RATHER DO IT THEMSELVES IN FACT THERE WERE THERE READY TO PUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN. TO DO IT THEMSELVES. IT'S THE FIRST TIME. THAT I'VE EVER SEEN SHAREHOLDER GROUPS AT PGA ANY FIGHT OVER WHO SHOULD PAY. INSTEAD OF PASSING THE BUCK TO US PLEASE INCLUDE AS GALLAGHER. WELL IF THEY EACH WANNA PAY. MAYBE BOTH OF THEM SHOULD PAY SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANYMORE. I'M SORRY IF YOU WOULD AND TOLD HIM MISTER SPEAKER BUT IF WE IF ALL WE DO TODAY IS PASS THIS BILL. WE WILL HAVE FAILED. WE MAY SAY THE DAY. FOR TODAY. BUT IT WILL BE A VICTORY THAT AS A PYRRHIC. ONE IF WE DON'T DO THE THINGS THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO DO AND SOME OF YOU ALLUDED TO THEM. IF WE DON'T DRASTICALLY REFORM THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THESE I'LL USE THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT GETTING IT DONE FOLKS. IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF FUELS. WE CAN'T CONTROL WHEN OR WHERE THE WIND BLOWS. BUT WE MOST ASSUREDLY CAN CONTROL THE FUEL ON OUR FORCES AND BRUSH LANDS HOW ABOUT FULLY FUNDING OR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. WHO ARE DOING GOD'S WORK IN HELPING PROTECT THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HELP PROTECT? MY COMMUNITY DURING THE CAMPFIRE MR GALLAGHER AND ASK YOU CONCLUDE PLEASE HARDEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT. WE NEED RATE RELIEF THAT COULD BE PROVIDED BY ALLOWING US TO PAY CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND PERHAPS CREATE OUR OWN MICRO GRIDS WE NEED TRUE OVERSIGHT OF THE SAFETY PLANTS. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL POINTED OUT THEY DON'T MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THOSE PLANS MISTER GALLAGHER ANY TO MISSED GALLAGHER TIME IS EXPIRED. ONLY. CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT WE WILL ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THEY MAKE. SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MR HOLDEN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU THOUGHTFULNESS. NOT JUST AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL. BUT AS IT'S BEEN. SPOKEN OUT BY MANY. THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. NOT ON THE SURFACE. BUT DEEP IN THE DETAILS AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION. OFFICIAL THROUGH A COMMITTEE HEARINGS. AND PROBING INTO THE IMPACTS OF CONCEPTS [inaudible] BUT ALSO [inaudible] WORKING GROUP'S. MEMBERS DEDICATED AND CONCERNED ENOUGH TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY WHAT CAN WE DO HOW CAN WE START TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE LARGER PICTURE AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING. ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AS IT RELATES TO WILDFIRES DEVASTATING OUR COMMUNITY AND THE VICTIMS. THE LEAVES IN ITS WAKE. AND SO THIS BILL. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. BROUGHT A LOT OF THE CONCEPTS TOGETHER. AND AS MANY OF YOU POINTED OUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OTHER ELEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AND MANY OF THOSE CAN PROBABLY BE ADDRESSED. BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION. MANY OF YOU HAVE LEGISLATION THAT STILL MOVING THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE. THE SILVER BULLET. OR THE FIX ALL. BUT IT DOES TAKE US. IN DRAMATIC LEAPS. TO WHERE WE CAN STABILIZE CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VICTIMS RATEPAYERS. AND THE INDUSTRY THE KEEPS OUR LIGHTS ON I WANT TO THANK. MY JOINT AUTHORS. HERE'S MY JOINT AUTHORS. HAD BLLS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE FUND. TALKING ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD LOOK AT CREATING SOME TYPE OF A EARLY ON OFFSET. SO THEY HAD BILLS IN MOTION. THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM CAME TOGETHER AND TOOK THOSE CONCEPTS AND GAVE SOME ADDITIONAL LIFE TO IT. SO WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT WE DO STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AND NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THAT THIS WAS A PERFECT BILL. BUT I WANT TO ALSO THANK. I RECOGNIZE MY COLLEAGUES. TO HAVE EXPERIENCE THE DEVASTATION OF WILDFIRES AND THE IMPACT ON THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE BROKE OUT MY WIFE AND I WE GOT THE CAR WE DROVE DOWN TO VENTURA WE SAW. A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SANTA BARBARA [inaudible] IN MISSOURI. WHO ARE DEALING WITH CONSTITUENTS? WHO WERE DEALING WITH? FIRE LEADERSHIP TRYING TO COORDINATE ACTIVITIES ALL THE WHILE. NOT ABLE TO BRIEF. BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY THE SMOKE THAT IN. VELIT THEIR COMMUNITIES. FIRE SMOKE THAT IMPACTS THE ENTIRE STATE WERE ALL IMPACTED. AND SO THIS MAKES US ONE CALIFORNIA TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS ALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND YES WE DO COME TOGETHER WE HAVE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND YES SOMETIMES WE CAN BUILD CONSENSUS AND YES SOMETIMES IT'S BIPARTISAN AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT. BUT ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WITH THIS STATE IS DEALING WITH THAT NO OTHER STATE IN THE UNION IS DEALING WITH. ONLY AUSTRALIA HAS THE CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE. TO TRY TO MANAGE A CATASTROPHE OR THE MAKINGS OF ONE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS WE'RE IN NEW FRONTS HERE. WE HAVE TO ADAPT. WE HAVE TO CREATE IDEAS WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH OUR BEST THINKING AND PLANS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD. NOT PASSING THIS BILL WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD. TOMORROW THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. TO TWEAK THOSE AREAS THAT NEED TO BE TWEAKED. EXPLORE FURTHER THERE OTHER AREAS THAT NEED TO BE EXPLORED THIRTY SECONDS MR HOLDEN. I THINK WE WILL PRAY FOR EACH OTHER. WE PRAY FOR VICTIMS. PEOPLE THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. BUT THERE CALIFORNIANS. TODAY IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT. AND TO DO SOMETHING THAT CREATES PREDICTABILITY GOING. FOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AGO. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN THANK YOU MEMBERS [inaudible] WITH THAT.

MS FREEMAN YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE 2% SB THREE OH SEVEN WHICH SEEKS TO PROTECT THE FRAGILE MOJAVE DESERT ECO SYSTEM FROM POSSIBLE OVER DRAFT BY PROPOSE WATER PROJECT. DUE TO CONCERN ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PUMPING PROPOSAL AND A SERIOUS CONFLICT IN THE SCIENCE SURROUNDING THE PROJECT. THE BILL HITS THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THE PROJECT TO ALLOW THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WORKING IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. TO REVIEW AND RECONCILE THE SCIENCE INVOKED SO THAT IT ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT MAYBE ESTABLISHED. MOJAVE DESERT IS VERY FRAGILE VERY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AND ITS EXISTED WITH A VERY DELICATE BALANCE FOR CENTURIES. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT WE GET THE SCIENCE RIGHT AS WE PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT WE WON'T GET ANOTHER CHANCE WITH THIS AREA. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ALLOWED TO BE DONE IN THE DESERT IS SUSTAINABLE ALLSTATE COSTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE MINOR OBSERVABLE OR REIMBURABLE TO THE STATE AGENCY. A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR PASSED THE ASSEMBLY WITH FIFTY VOTES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS FREEMAN MISTER OVER LTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES THIS PROJECT IS WITHIN MY DISTRICT AND SO. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT I SENT SPENT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS IN INVESTIGATING THIS PROJECT IN VISITING THE PROJECT SITE. FIRST OF ALL IT'S PROBABLY TOO MUCH TO ASK. THAT PEOPLE STOP MISPRONOUNCING. THE THIS REGIONAL BY DESTRUCTIVE STOPPER DOUBTS KITTIES IT'S PRONOUNCED KATIE'S RHYMES WITH HAITI'S AND IF YOU'VE EVER GONE OUT THERE IN AUGUST YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS IMAGINE SOMEONE COMING TO YOU AND SAYING. WE'D LIKE TO PUMP MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A YEAR OUT OF YOUR DISTRICT INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S DISTRICT WOULD THAT BE OKAY. SO I WENT OUT TO THE PROJECT SITE I MET WITH THE PROJECT DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGERS. THEY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS AS BEST THEY COULD IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME SO I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE ENGINEERS I SPENT MANY HOURS WITH THE ENGINEERS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT. BASICALLY THIS AREA OF MY DISTRICT IS AN ENORMOUS WATERSHED IN WATER FLOWS UNDERGROUND FROM THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DOWN INTO THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. AND EVENTUALLY THE WATER PERCOLATES UP INTO THESE VAST. DRY LAKE BEDS WHERE IT EVAPORATES IN THE ATMOSPHERE THESE LAKE BEDS ARE VERY BRINY BECAUSE OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE WATER EVAPORATION OF THE WATER HAS LEFT FOR A BLOCK BEHIND MINERAL CONTENT. SO THE MOMENT THAT WATER HITS THAT BRIAN IT'S UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AFFECT ITS MUCH SALTIER THAN THE OCEAN EVEN BIRDS AND WILDLIFE CANNOT DRINK IT. YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY. ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. REGARDING BIGHORN SHEEP AND THE DRYING UP OF NATURAL SPRINGS BUT I CAN TELL YOU HAVING BEEN OUT THERE THAT IS COMPLETE. HOGWASH. THIS THOSE SITES ARE THOUSANDS OF VERTICAL SPEED FEED COP THE WATERSHED FROM THE EXTRACTION SITE. WHAT THE KATIE'S PROJECT IS PROPOSING TO DO IS TO EXTRACT THAT WATER BEFORE IT GETS TO THE BRINY -- DRY LAKE BEDS AND EVAPORATES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO IT CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE ANY AFFECT ON THESE UPSTREAM USES ALSO. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAYBE THE OVER PUMPING OF WATER OUT OF THAT SITE IF YOU'VE CONCERN OF THE MAYBE THE ENGINEERS GOT THE HYDROLOGY ROCK WHICH IS A CONCERN THAT I HAVE. YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT AS I DO IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THE COUNTY OF SAN BENITO EXAMINE THIS PROJECT. THEY PUT A STRICT REQUIREMENT ON THE TOPIC OF THE WATER AND IF THE WATER LEVEL IN THE WATER TABLE GETS ONE INCH BELOW. WHAT THE KATIE'S ENGINEERS PREDICT THAT IT WILL BE? THEY HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY STOP POPPING SO ANOTHER WORDS IF THEY'RE WRONG ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT THEY MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP POPPING AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP AND RE EVALUATE THAT. SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE OFTEN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS DISCUSSIONS IN THIS CHAMBER ABOUT WATER AND A LOT. OF THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS ARGUMENTS ABOUT WATER BETWEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE HAD INTENSE DEBATES ABOUT THE DELTA TITLES AND ALL OF THESE CONVEYANCE MECHANISMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A PROJECT THAT'S ALREADY LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM NO. BECAUSE OF THIS. AND LASTLY I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE TERRIBLE PRECEDENT THAT WE'RE SETTING HERE THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS ALREADY GONE THROUGH NUMEROUS LEVELS OF INTENSE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THEY HAVE JUMP THROUGH EVERY SINGLE HOOP THE GOVERNMENT COULD PUT IN FRONT OF THEM. SO WHAT WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE IF WE PASS THIS BILL TODAY. IS THAT NONE OF THAT MATTERS AND THAT IF ENOUGH POWERFULLY CONNECTED PEOPLE GET TOGETHER. THEY CAN SPONSOR A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO STOP ANY PROJECT. SO I ASK YOU IF WE SET THAT PRECEDENT WHAT COMES NEXT. IF A GROUP WANTS TO STOP AN INFORMAL HOUSING PROJECT IN THEIR DISTRICT. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD CAN THEY DO THAT CAN THEY RUN A BILL LIKE THIS PUT AN INVITE ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HURDLES IN PLACE WHAT ABOUT THE ACCESS TO THE COAST. CAN WEALTHY PEOPLE ON THE COAST LINE PETITION AND HAVE A BILL BROUGHT FORWARD. THIS IS NOT A DIRECTION THAT WE WANT TO GO. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS CREATES MILLIONS OF GALLONS. OF WATER FOR HUMAN USE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST TO EVAPORATION THE ATMOSPHERE. IT'S HAD NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND THERE ARE STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS TERRIBLE PRECEDENT SETTING BILL. THEY WISH OBERNOLTE MISTER BROKE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB THREE OH SEVEN IT SEEKS TO STOP TO KATIE'S PROJECT IN THE LIMITED A WATER THEY CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S ANNUALLY. THE PROJECT IMPROVES LOCAL WATER SUPPLY RIGHT LIABILITY AND REDUCES DEMAND FOR OUR AREA FROM DELTA AND COLORADO RIVER WATER -- KATIE'S AS BEEN SAID IS LOCATED A SOLID CALIFORNIANS LESS ENERGY NEEDED TO TRANSPORT THE WATER. THIS MANAGES ENERGY DEMANDS REDUCES A MICHELIN STABILIZES WATER RATES THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE A SUPPORT OVER FIFTY NINE HUNDRED JOBS GENERATE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE INCLUDING FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE SAME PER DO YOU KNOW COUNTY BUDGET. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS REVIEW HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY. HAP HAPPEN UNDER SEQUEL IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER AGENCY IN MY DISTRICT CONDUCTED AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PUBLIC REVIEW PROCESS. WHICH HELD INFORMATION WORKSHOPS EDUCATION SEMINARS AND PUBLIC HEARINGS TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE FROM THE COMMUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOLLOWING YEARS OF ANALYSIS FIELD STUDIES IN PUBLIC VIEW. THE DISTRICTS CERTIFIED THE FINAL E. ARE FEDERALLY IMPROVE THE PROJECT UNDER SEQUEL. THE FEDERAL E. I. R. SUMMARIZE THE PROJECT WOULD AVOID ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO DOES IT RESOURCES INCLUDING CRITICAL RESOURCES OF THE DESERT ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS VEGETATION MOUNTAIN WATER. SPRINGS AND AIR QUALITY. ALSO RESPONSIBLE AGENCY UNDER SEQUENCE SAMBAR TO DO YOU KNOW FACILITY TO REVIEW PROCESS OF THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING IN MITIGATION PROJECT IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THIRTEEN THESE APPROVALS FOR CHALLENGING COURT THESE CASES WITH WITHDRAWN OR OTHERWISE SMIS. AND SIX PRECEDED THE TRIAL ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT TONIGHT ALL THE SEQUEL GAMES AGAINST PROJECT AN UP HILL THE PROJECTS REVIEWS. AND APPROVALS THESE RULES WERE APPEAL TO THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS AND WE'RE UP HELD IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE BILL WOULD ADD TWO MORE REVIEWS THE SECRET PROCESS AND SIMPLY DISREGARD TO THROW SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH WE CONSIDERED THE GOLD STANDARD. AND WAS APPROVED IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE NEED MORE WATER PROJECTS NOT FEWER IN HERE WE SET A PRECEDENT THAT THE PROJECT IT'S GOING TO SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> UP IN TEN YEARS AND SOMEBODY COMES ALONG AND SAYS WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH LET'S AT ANOTHER STATE AGENCY. SINCE THE LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THIS PROJECT WE HAVE LOST TWENTY BILLION GALLONS OF EVAPORATED WATER. THIS ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC THE CELL PLAN IN MY DISTRICT. WOULD MAKE A SELF RELIANT WE NEED TO SUPPORT LOCAL DISTRICTS IN THEIR CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY IN THEIR PROJECTS AND NOT HAVE STATE INTERFERENCE AS THEY WORK TO INCREASE SUPPLY. AND PRESERVE OUR VALUABLE WATER RESOURCES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOVO. WITH YOUR FLORA YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE OH SEVEN AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND FOR LONG BUT I WANT TO REITERATE JUST A COUPLE QUICK POINTS. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION IN THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW IN IN OUR CHAMBER. BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY VERY DIRE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. THE PRECEDENT THAT IT SETS. FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US THEY HAVE PROJECTS IN OUR DISTRICT. THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH SEQUEL. THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL -- REVIEWS THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH IT ALL. HAS BEEN HELD UP IN A COURT OF LAW. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A POLITICAL FRIEND AND MONEY. YOU CAN RUN PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO JAM IT UP. THE PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE THIS PROJECT THEY DON'T WANT THIS PROJECT TO MORE AND REFUSED TO BE DONE THEY WANT IT DEAD. IF THIS PROJECT DIES. THE WATER COMES FROM PEOPLE FROM MY DISTRICT IN THE PEOPLE NORTH OF ME. THE GOVERNOR'S MADE A VERY CLEAR ABOUT A STATE WIDE WATER FIX WHICH I SUPPORT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE CANNOT HAVE A STATEWIDE WATER FIX IF WE CAN'T GET PROJECTS LIKE THIS DONE. COLLEAGUES IT IS LONG.
