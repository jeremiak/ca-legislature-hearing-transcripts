THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS A

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.626
THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THE

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.694
WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN WORKING

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.396

PAN HAS BEEN I HAD A LOT OF

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.400
INTEREST IN THIS AS WELL- THIS

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:16.268
IDEA OF- AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.803
IMPORTANT PORTANTINO CLEAR THAT

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.238
THE- AS WE- IS THE SENATE'S

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.006
PLAN TO BUILD BACK BOLDLY AND

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.976
SIMPLY TRY TO. OF MAXIMIZE THE

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:25.177
RESOURCES FOR OUR MOST

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.279
VULNERABLE AND ANNA AND MAKE

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.248
SURE SAFETY NET IS STRONG AND

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.816
THAT WE'RE NOT INTENDING FOR

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.684
MONEY OWED TO FAMILIES TO GO

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.720
AWAY BUT JUST THE MONEY- TO THE

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:37.923
STATE. IN IN SOME WOULD SAY-

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.125
THAT THESE THESE LOST OUR FROM-

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.060
THAT POVERTY LAWS WE WANT TO

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.396
TRY TOPUNISH PEOPLE AND SO THE

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.365
DEBT THAT IS COLLECTED FROM

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:48.100
FAMILIES. WORKING PARENTS

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:49.468
OFTENTIMES ARE NEVER ALLOWS

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.703
THEM TO GET AHEAD- SO TO IN

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.205
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.039
BE ABLE TO GET MORE TO THEIR

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.340
FAMILIES AND NOT AS MUCH TO

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:56.909
STATE PASSAGE THAT. IS

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.043
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.946
THAT'S- CAN CREATE A WHOLE FOR

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.581
THE STATE BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.149
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- THERE'S

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.117
GONNA BE SOME MONEY RIGHT NOW

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.518
SO WHY DON'T WE USE IT TO BE

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.320
ABLE TO. CARE FOR FAMILIES AND

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.656

PROPOSAL IT'S GOOD FOR FAMILIES

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:45.224
AND IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.092
FOR CALIFORNIA REQUIRING

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:48.427
PARENTS WITH VERY LITTLE

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.729
INCOMES TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.898
FOR THE COST OF SAFETY NET

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.666
SERVICES HAS DEVASTATING

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.768
CONSEQUENCES FOR FATHERS FOR

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.737
MOTHERS AND FOR CHILDREN IN

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.139
THESE IMPACTS FALL HARDEST ON

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.541
LOW INCOME BLACK AND BROWN

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.877
FAMILIES ACROSS OUR STATE IT'S

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.512
A PRACTICE WHICH DOES FAR MORE

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.347
HARM THAN GOOD. THE PUNITIVE

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.848
PENALTIES THAT SAID AND WHEN

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:11.683
PARENTS CANNOT PAY THIS DEBT

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.886
THAT GROWS AT ASTRONOMICAL

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.555
RATES FROM A 10% INTEREST RATE

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:17.789
SUCH AS SUSPENDING THEIR

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.591
DRIVER'S LICENSE KNOCKING DOWN

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.727
THEIR CREDIT SCORE MAKE IT VERY

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:25.330
HARD- FOR PARENTS TO WORK AND

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.332
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.134
PRACTICE DIRECTLY TAKES MONEY

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.904
AWAY FROM CHILDREN IN POVERTY

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.739
THE PEOPLE WHO NEED US THE MOST

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.073
A FEW YEARS AGO TO ADDRESS

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.375
THESE PROBLEMS AND SAN

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.210
FRANCISCO WE COLLABORATED WITH

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.112
PHILANTHROPIC PROGRAM-

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:42.314
FOUNDATIONS THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.283
CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. AND WE

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:47.119
USE THE COOP PROGRAM TO PAY OFF

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.087
THE GOVERNMENT JET OF THIRTY

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.522
TWO PARENTS WE THOUGHT IF WE

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.624
PAID OFF THIS GOVERNMENT DEBT

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.326
THAT THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.229
IN THE STUDY WOULD MAKE LARGER

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.864
AND MORE CONSISTENT PAYMENTS

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.465
SINCE THEY KNEW THEIR PAYMENTS

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.134
WERE GOING WHERE THEY SHOULD TO

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.535
THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT'S

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.971
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS ACCORDING

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:06.738
TO A STUDY BY THE URBAN

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.674
INSTITUTE. THEY WERE FATHERS

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.908
LIKE A MAN NAMED JOE WHO

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:12.377
PARTICIPATED JOE WAS STRUGGLING

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.779
TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:15.814
GOVERNMENT OWED CHILD SUPPORT

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.883
THAT HE WAS LIVING IN HIS VAN

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.618
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE HAD BEEN

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.186
SUSPENDED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:24.156
PAY THIS GOVERNMENT THAT AND IT

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.824
WAS HARD FOR HIM O HANG ON TO

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.459
HIS JOB AS A SOCIAL SECURITY

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.928
GUARD FROM HIS CREDIT WAS SHOT

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:31.630
SO HE COULDN'T REALLY GET INTO

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:34.533
N APARTMENT- AFTER THE

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.805
GOVERNMENT. DEBT WAS PAID OFF

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:40.706
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM I'M JOE

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:43.241
GOT DRIVER'S BACK AND HE WENT

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:44.176
TO FOR. HE WAS TO GO INTO AN

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:45.310
APARTMENT HE TO ME ABOUT YOUR

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.845
TO HE WAS MORE TIME WITH HIS

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.347
KIDS BECAUSE YOU COULD AFFORD

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.948
TO DO THINGS WITH THEM. LIKE

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.683
TAKE THEM TO GET ICE CREAM OR

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.619
GO TO THE MOVIES HE WAS ALSO

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.220
SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THE

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:57.656
CHILDREN'S MOTHER PREVIOUSLY HE

00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.391
WAS JUST DROPPING HIS KIDS OFF

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:01.259
AND THEN TAKING OFF IN HIS CAR.

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:02.260
NOW THEY WOULD CHECK OUT OF

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:03.829
THAT AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.831
IMPROVED AND EVERYTHING HE WAS

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.767
PAYING WENT TO HIS CHILDREN AND

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:09.368
TO HER AND NOT TO THE

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.436
GOVERNMENT. THE STUDY BY THE

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.839
URBAN INSTITUTE FOUND THAT WHEN

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.540
WE GOT RID OF THIS GOVERNMENT

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.376
THAT PARENTS MADE LARGER AND

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.645
MORE CONSISTENT PAYMENTS HOW DO

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:20.646
YOU SPELL YOUR STUDENT

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.314
REQUIREMENTS. THEIR CREDIT

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.649
SCORES WENT UP AND THEY HAD

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.951
MORE STABLE HOUSING AND IMPROVE

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.419
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.588
PARENTS AND CPARENTS. SO I

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.690
SUPPORT ANY EFFORT TO REALLY

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.325
LIFT THE BURDEN OF THIS

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:37.129
GOVERNMENT YEAH. FAMILIES

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.464
SIMPLY CANNOT IT. I THINK THE-

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.133
TO AUTOMATICALLY LIMIT THIS

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.735
GOVERNMENT- DEBT. FOR FOLKS WHO

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.404
ARE JUST GETTING BY ON SOCIAL

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.507
SECURITY OR SSI IS SO IMPORTANT

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.175
I RECENTLY SPOKE TO A

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.944
GRANDFATHER. FREDDIE PERSONS

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.246
WHO LIVES IN THE BAYVIEW AND

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:56.782
SAN FRANCISCO. HE'S GOT SPOTTED

00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:58.550
ON A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR SOCIAL

00:21:58.617 --> 00:21:59.918
SECURITY CHECK AND UNTIL

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.087
RECENTLY WE WERE GARNISHING AS

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.822
A STATE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:06.992
OF HIS CHECK. THAT WENT TO THE

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.660
GOVERNMENT IT DIDN'T GO TO HIS

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.729
KIDS IT DIDN'T GO TO HIS FAMILY

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.330
AND IT MADE IT VERY HARD FOR MR

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:14.766
PERSONS TO GET BY. SO WE HAVE

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:15.934
AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.470
OBLIGATION TO REALLY HELP.

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.672
FOLKS LIKE MRPERSONS AND LIKE

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:22.641
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ACROSS

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.342
THE STATE WHO ARE STRUGGLING

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:26.478
UNDER THE BURDEN OF THIS STAT.

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:28.680
THIS AUTOMATIC SOLUTION TO LIST

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:31.083
THIS STAT BOB PEOPLE GETTING BY

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.418
THESE MEANS TESTED BENEFITS. IS

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.487
THE FIRST STEP BUT WE NEED TO

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:37.489
GO MUCH FURTHER AS A STATE AND

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.558
ELIMINATE THIS GOVERNMENT- DEBT

THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.377

THINGS CAN WE DO TO RELEASE THE

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:02.547

STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.858
YOU KNOW WE SHOULD MAKE

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:16.161
EVIDENCE BASED POLICY AND- WHEN

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.196
WE LOOK AT THIS. WE ALSO THINK.

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:19.598
EVEN FOR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:20.832
SO EVEN FROM A STRICTLY

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:24.236
FINANCIAL STANDPOINT- WHEN WE

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:25.370
DE MOTIVATE PEOPLE FROM

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:26.972
ESSENTIALLY BE ABLE TO PAY

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.206
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT THE

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.241
MONEY THEY'RE PUTTING INTO

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:30.509
SPAIN GARNISH OR PUTTING THE

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.743
END IS NOT ACTUALLY SUPPORTING

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.111
THEIR- THEIR- THEIR- THEIR

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:36.214
CHILDREN- BUT INSTEAD IS BEING.

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:39.050
TAKEN OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:40.352
THE END NOT ONLY THAT MONEY NOT

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:41.486
GETTING TO THE CHILDREN IT

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.188
DIDN'T. BUT WE END UP PAYING

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.323
FOR IT ANYWAY- I MEAN THROUGH

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.494
OUR OTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO- IT

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:51.062
INSTEAD WHAT WE JUST DO IS WE-

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:52.731
WE HAVE A CIRCULAR THING GOING

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.733
ON WITH HER. OKAY FINE WE TAKE

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.801
MONEY WE STICK IT IN SOME

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.402
ACCOUNT BUT THEN WE'RE SPENDING

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.404
OTHER STATE MONEY- AND ALSO

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:00.639
LOCAL MONIES TO HELP PROVIDE

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:01.773
SUPPORT TO THE FAMILIES BECAUSE

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.108
THEY'RE NOT. ABLE TO GET

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:04.342
BECAUSE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:05.310
GOING TO THEM IT'S GOING TO THE

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:09.014
STATE. AND I THINK THE- SO WE

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.582
REALLY SHOULD LOOK WHEN WE LOOK

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.050
AT SOME OF THESE POLICIES

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.486
REALLY ABOUT- WHAT THE NET

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:15.854
EFFECT REALLY IS ON THE STATE

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.355
SO FOR DOES FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:18.423
BE LISTENING AND SAYING WELL

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.258
GEE YOU KNOW WHAT. ISN'T THIS

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.893
GOING TO COST THE STATE MONEY.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.628
AND AGAIN SOMEONE CAN DO THE

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:25.197
COUNTING ON THIS I WOULD ARGUE

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:26.998
THAT IT WILL COST THE STATE A

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.500
LOT LESS MONEY THAN IT MAY SEEM

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.702
LIKE ON. THE FRONT BECAUSE IN

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:33.471
THE END WE ARE PAYING. OUT FOR

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.807
THIS AS WELL SO EVEN THOUGH WE

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:36.575
DON'T WORK OUR NATION AND

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.577
AGAIN- THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:41.313

A WAY THAT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY

TO ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THE

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:10.642
CHILDREN LESS ABLE TO GET. YOU

BARELY PAY DSPS MINIMUM WAGE.

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:15.392
THESE LOW WAGES ARE A RESULT OF

SHELF THAT WE ACTUALLY. DO AND

ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS AND SO

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.522
ONE OF THE- GOALS OF THE

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:33.756
DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING IS TO BE

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.426
MORE OF THAT. A PERSON CENTRED

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.960
VIEW THAT CAN CONECT THE WHOLE

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.329
CONTINUUM OF CARE- AND ONE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.065
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OUR

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.400

COMMITTEE WAS STAKEHOLDERS THAT

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.374
HAVE. IF I GOT DISCOUNT RATE

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.743
FIVE AGENCIES SEVEN DEPARTMENTS

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:54.510

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.813
ATTENDANCE- TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.714
IT REALLY MEANS TO. TO ACHIEVE

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.349
HOLDING COMMUNITY LIVING.

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.251
SEPARATELY WE WOULD HAVE POLICY

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.786
POSITIONS- ARE AT ACTED

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.388
APARTMENT AGING CREATING THIS

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:06.756
NEW POLICY SHOP THAT WOULD LOOK

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.624
AT THE HOUSING. CONTINUUM THAT

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.626

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.928
THAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF YES

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.429

VOLUNTEER IN CLOSE THE DIGITAL

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.000
DIVIDE. SO I WE BELIEVE THAT

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.702
THAT POLICY SHOP IS CRITICAL TO

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:21.637
PROVIDING THAT PERSON CENTERED.

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:28.144
DOWN ALIGNMENT UP. OLDER ADULTS

AS THEY SERVE. THE MANY

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.413
DEPARTMENTS AGE. ARE AND MAYBE

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.281

LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE GOALS-

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.653
OTHER PIECES IN THERE INCLUDE-

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.654
WE DON'T HAVE OUR AGING

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.590
PROGRAMS AND DATA SYSTEMS YET-

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.291
AND- THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.359
GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.128
IT RIGHT FROM THE START. AND SO

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.362
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING VERY

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.364
CLOSELY AT AN AGING SYSTEM FOR

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.565
AGING AND DISABILITY DATA

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:50.900
PROGRAMS THAT NOT ONLY WOULD

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.535
ALLOW US TO PERFORMANCE MANAGE

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.237
AND BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT DATA.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.405
BUT CRITICALLY CONNECTED COUNTY

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.007
SOCIAL SERVICES FOR AGING

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.375
CRITICALLY CONNECT WITH HEALTH

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.377
PLANS FOR AGING- WORK FOR BOTH

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.713
THE TRIPLE A.'S IN THE IOC'S.

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:06.682
SO THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.017
TO USE THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.952
