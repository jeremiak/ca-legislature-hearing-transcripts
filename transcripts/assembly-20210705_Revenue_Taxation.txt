I DON'T KNOW I JUST I MEAN LIKE I. THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT WERE SET. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON- THAT ENSURING MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS WITH ONLINE SALES TOTALING MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. TO REPORT THE AMOUNT OF TAXABLE SALES THEY COME PLEADING EACH CITY OR COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE. DESIGNED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE MANIPULATION OF THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORMS LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. BY MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND A HANDFUL OF CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. UNDER BRADLEY BYRNE SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT. OF SALE. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION THE STORE IS LOCATED AT. ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER ARE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUES THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT REVENUES TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE ANYWHERE THEY HAVE A WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTER. OR EVEN A SALES OFFICE. CORPORATIONS USE THIS AS LEVERAGE TO EXTRACT DEALS FROM CITIES ALLOWING THE COMPANIES TO OBTAIN A SHARE OF THE SALES TAXES THAT THEY COLLECT. BOB IN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE CORPORATIONS BETWEEN 50% AND ALLOCATED TO THEIR JURISDICTION. TAXES THAT WERE PAID BY RESIDENTS FROM OTHER CITIES AROUND THE STATE. AT A TIME WHEN ONLINE SHOPPING IS AT ITS PEAK. AND CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. COMPANIES ARE SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS. MEMBERS A FEW CITIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THESE DEALS HAVE SUBMITTED LETTERS OF OPPOSITION. ONE OF THEM IS THE CITY OF CUPERTINO. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TALK ABOUT WHY THAT CITY OPPOSES THIS BILL. AS YOU KNOW CUPERTINO ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST CITIES IN THE STATE IS HOME TO APPLE. ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. AND CUPERTINO HAS A SPECIAL DEAL WITH APPLE. EVERY TIME ANYONE IN CALIFORNIA BY SAY A PHONE OR AN IPAD OR A COMPUTER FROM APPLE ONLINE. APPLE SENDS ALL THE LOCAL PORTION OF THAT SALES TAX THEY COLLECT THE CUPERTINO. IN RETURN CUPERTINO GETS 35% OF THAT SALES TAX REVENUE TO APPLE. 35% THANKS TO THIS DEAL. AND THE SURGE IN ONLINE SHOPPING LAST YEAR. THE CITY GAVE APPLE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN JUST TWO QUARTERS OF THE LAST YEAR. THAT WAS MONEY PAID BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AT NIGHT OF IT WENT TO THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. APPLE IN CUPERTINO WE'RE NOT ALONE. MANY ITIES AROUND THE STATE HAVE SIMILAR DEALS. WITH BEST BUY HOME DEPOT AND- MANY OTHER COMPANIES. NOW THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE TO KNOW JUST HOW MUCH REVENUE THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE SIPHONING FROM EACH OF OUR CITIES. BUT UNDER TODAY'S SYSTEM THERE IS NO WAY FOR ANY OF US TO NOW. SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS NICK ROMO FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND STATES STACY HEATON FROM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH NICK ROMAN OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES FIRST PLEASE. YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER WRITER I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU- CARE MEMORY NECRO ON BEHALF OF THE OF CALIFORNIA CITY CALLING IN SUPPORT OF SEVEN NINETY TWO TODAY ABOUT THE ANALYSIS MENTIONED- THIS IS A MEASURE THAT AIMS TO BETTER INFORM THE PUBLIC OUR STATE OR COUNTY OF THE IMPACT OF THE FLOW OF GOODS IN ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. WE ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE CITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AS IT STADS TODAY BUT THE AUTHOR RIGHTFULLY POINTS OUT I WILL LEGISLATING RATHER IN THE DARK WE NEED MORE INFORMATION THIS TO OPT OUT PUT OUT A FINE A POINT ON THAT TODAY I'M OUR BEST SALES TAX- ANALYSTS ARE CONSULTANTS- MARKETING STAFF ONLY WORKING WITH ABOUT HALF OF THE DATA. FROM SALES TAX ALLOCATION ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE ONLY ABLE TO MODEL- THE IMPACT OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS AND BADLY BYRNE'S MOVE MAY WELL WE'LL GET HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S POINT EIGHTY TWO CITY THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MORE DATA WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ONLINE SALES ARE. THEY AND WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BENEFIT I FELT A GROUP OF CITY MANAGER SOUNDS CALCULATOR CALIFORNIA CITY GOT STANDING FOR AN EIGHTY TWO THIRTY IN THE STATE THEY CAME TOGETHER IN THE FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS DISCUSSION FAILED GREETING AND- MORE DATA IS NEEDED ON A DAY THAT I CALLED ONE SEVEN NINETY TWO. I WILL ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT TODAY THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITY ABOUT DISADVANTAGED MEANS THE IMPACT OF DISTRIBUTION SENATE IMPACT ONLINE SALES ON THE CITY TO HOST THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WE CAN FIND SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EQUITABLE TAMPINES LESIONS THAT CAN MOVE THE HEAD OF PACKED INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TAKING IT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW DO WE SUPPORT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HOW THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AS WELL AS- OKAY MORE EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF SALES TAXES ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE. SO THAT WILL BE SUPPORT SB. SEVEN NINETY TWO THANK AND APPRECIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE MODERN NOW COULD US WITH. HIDDEN OF THE CAN REP. OF GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE STAY HEAT THOROUGH COUNTY WHERE. OF ARE PEOPLE THIRTY FIVE WORLD STATEWIDE. I'M SPEAKS TODAY IN FAVOR OF THE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY TWO AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BENEFIT FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF SALES TAX UNDER BRADLEY BYRNE. I TIED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PRECURSORS RESIDENTS ARE NOW FINDING DIMINISHING REVENUES AS YOU BRADLEY BURNS ALLOCATIONS ARE MADE AT THE POINT OF SALE OR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS COMPANY OPPOSITE THEIR WAREHOUSES ARE LOCATED. BROKING ENTITIES ARE NOT NATURAL STAE FOR CENTRALIZED DISTRIBUTION OR SALES OF GOODS FROM MAJOR RETAILERS AND THAT MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPETE OR INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO LOCATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE KICKBACK AGREEMENTS WERE MEANING THAT THE POLICIES TO RETAILERS A PERCENTAGE OF BRADLEY BURNS ALLOCATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR. CERTAIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS ALSO SKEWED TOWARD URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS WITH MORE SPACE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND AWAY FROM OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO THIS COOK ARE ARE RURAL AREAS IN A VERY DISADVANTAGED- POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE SHIFT. TO ONLINE SALES PARTICULARLY SINCE MANY OF OUR WORLD I RESIDENTS NOW DO A LOT MORE ONLINE PURCHASING. WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILL IS A GREAT START TO JUST GATHER DATA ON HOW IT'S IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTIES. AND TO SEE EXACTLY HOW THESE AGREEMENTS ARE IMPACTING. SALES TAX DISTRIBUTION AND WE URGE YOUR AYE. VOTE ON THE MEASURE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THE WATER MODERATOR PLEASE NOW OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN PLEASE TO ONE OF THEM VERO. AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO ONE IN Q.

SITUATION DRAMATICALLY- YOU KNOW WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD MADE HIS DECISION ON THIS ISSUE AND- APPROVED EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY FIVE BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE TRANSPARENCY WITH THESE AGREEMENTS- YEAH HE HAD MENTIONED IN HIS I SIGNATURE AND HIS DOES. I THINK YOU GET A MESSAGE ACTUALLY- BUT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT LOCAL TOOL THAT HELPS TO- YOU KNOW HOW. THAT ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY- SPECIFICALLY IN RURAL AREAS- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE A MUCH BROADER DISCUSSION OVER WHAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS YEAR ONE THAT- IS CERTAINLY VERY VALUABLE I MEAN FOR OUR CITY INTO FOR THESE REASONS- WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN ON. OPPOSED TO THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU WITH THE MODERN NOW CONNECTED MACHINE. I'M IN A ROOM IN YOUR NAME THE CITY OF. R. S.

ON THIS TOPIC. FOR OUR CITIES WHO DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE ONLY. ECONOMIC TOOL THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AVAIL OURSELVES UP I THINK IT THERE SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT TRANSPARENCY BUT ALSO. WE SHOULD RECORD THAT AB FORTY FIVE ONE FORTY INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM WHICH DEALS WITH THE AGREEMENT AND IS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY PROCEED CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE BILL IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE PUBLIC POLICY BUT IT'S A CALIFORNIA AND FOR THOSE REASONS WILL REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY MODERATOR WE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL- OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. CERTAINLY AGAIN IF THERE'S ANY TESTIMONY PLEASE PRESS.

TO THAT COMMUNITY I SEE IT IS- YOU KNOW DETRIMENTAL NOT ADVANTAGEOUS TO MY COMMUNITY. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY THOUGH TO- IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT TO TELL ME KIND OF HOW. HOW YOU DISAGREE AND HOW THIS IS IN THE INTEREST OF MY COMMITTEES TOO OFTEN- AND YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS BEFORE THAT GOT THE HOUSE THE HAVE NOTS OF CALIFORNIAN HOW I FEEL. OUR COASTAL AND URBAN NEIGHBORS TREAT US IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS OFTEN- EXPECTING US JUST TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE SCRAPS FROM THEIR TABLES AND- AND PUTTING MEASURES IN PLACE THAT FRANKLY. BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUENTS TO DRIVE SEVERAL HOURS A DAY FOR JOBS- YOU KNOW IMPACTING OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND- THEN CONVERSELY NOT BUILDING MORE LANES BECAUSE WE'RE SAVING THE WORLD FROM CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEREFORE CAN'T MAKE. LIFE EASIER ON THOSE VERY FAMILY SAYS A LOT OF HYPOCRISY IS THAT I SEE- I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM- YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON MANY MANY ISSUES SO. JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHERE THIS IS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MY COMMUNITY. THREE THE CHAIR ABSOLUTELY. THAT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND APPROPRIATE ALWAYS YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW THE BILL THAT WE HAD THE DEBATE ABOUT BEFORE WAS A BILL THAT SAID. NO NEW DEALS. THE WORK ON A ROLL BACK ANY OF THE EXISTING DEALS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. MADE WITH. YOUR CITIES JUST SAID THAT GOING FORWARD THERE SHOULD BE ANY MORE KICKBACK AGREEMENTS WHILE WE EVALUATE. THE STATE OF OUR TAX SYSTEM. THIS BILL ALL IT SAYS IS. BUT REPORT THAT DATA TO THE TAX AUTHORITY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE IT ANOTHER DEBATE ABOUT THE FACTS- YOU MAY ARGUE OR SOMEONE MAY ARGUE THAT THIS DISTRICT THAT HURTS MY CITY OR HELPS YOURS. BUT NOBODY HAS ACTUALLY THE FAX ON WHO'S GAINING AND WHO'S LOSING. UNDER THE EXISTING TAX SYSTEM THAT WE ADDRESSING THIS BILL SO I WOULD SAY DEAL WITH RESPECT. EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY FEEL IT MIGHT DISADVANTAGE YOUR CITIES YOU COULD BE VERY SURPRISED- WHEN THE FAX CAME OUT IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED TO ACTUALLY SEE WHO WHO DOES GAIN. AND WHO DOES NOT. AND I CERTAINLY ALIGN MYSELF. WITH THE COMMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MAY BENEFIT FRESNO BUT GO DOWN THE FREEWAY A FEW MILES AND THAT NEXT IMPOVERISHED TOWN MAYBE THE ONE THAT'S REALLY BEING HEARD. SO I SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS. LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE- MAKING THOSE DECISIONS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AND WE CAN SEE THE WHOLE PLAYING FIELD. THAT OUR TAX POLICY AFFECTS AND THAT'S ALL THIS BILL WILL DO AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MASON. EVEN THOUGH I'VE GOT A GREAT AFFECTION FOR OF THE DAY THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN FRONT OF ME- WHO REPRESENTS A PART OF THE STATE THAT IS- UNDER SERVED AND- AND DISADVANTAGED I ALSO REPRESENT A PART OF THE STATE THAT IS UNDERSERVED ANDDISADVANTAGED IN FACT THE CITY OF PARIS ALTHOUGH I DON'T REPRESENT THE CITY OF PARIS CITY PERSON VERY CLOSE. TO MY DISTRICT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN IN INLAND CALIFORNIA THAT FEEL THAT THEY THEY NEED TO COME UP HAVE HAVE SOME SORT OF A LEG UP THE PROBLEM REALLY IS IN CALIFORNIA R. I. TAX SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS COMPLETELY SCREWED UP IT HAS BEEN FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. ARE ALSO A DISADVANTAGED- ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO. GET A LITTLE BIT MORE REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE JUST THE BASICS. OF SERVICE SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND- WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS JUST TO YOUR POINT- YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE ONE COMMUNITY DOING IT AT THE NEXT MEETING WHAT TO DO WITH THE NEXT THING WE WANT TO DO IT. YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM THAT IS COMPLETELY SCREWED UP I THINK. OF THE- THE STRATEGY THAT YOU'VE GOT HERE MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE WHICH IS WHY SECONDED. THE MOTION AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY THANK YOU FOR. OF YOUR DILIGENT WORK IN THIS REGARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR I'M- I THINK DIFFERENT CONCERNS THAN- THOSE RAISED BY FIVE EIGHT THAT THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION- ANOTHER IN OPPOSITION LETTER POINTED OUT THAT THIS CREATES A DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT ACTUALLY WE ALREADY HAVE THE DATA NECESSARY TO DO THIS ANALYSIS AND TO HAVE THIS KIND OF INSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY CAN YOU JUST. SPEAK TO THAT. CONCERNED YEAH I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE TRIED FOR YEARS TO TRY TO GET THE ACTUAL FACTS. AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES- IN THEIR OWN WAY AS TRIED AS WELL AND NONE OF US CAN GET THE- THE DATA ON IT THESE TYPES OF ONLINE- PURCHASES. AND WHERE THOSE TAX MONIES ARE GOING SO WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL FOCUSES ON DATA COLLECTION. IT IS INFORMATION THAT RETAILERS ALREADY PROVIDE. TERMS OF WHERE SOMEONE IS ORDERED THE PRODUCT FROM SO IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO- ACCUMULATE THAT THAT INFORMATION AND SHARE WITH ALL OF US IN A TRANSPARENT WAY THAT'S ALL THIS BILL REALLY TRIES TO DO AT THIS POINT AND THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR SPIRITED DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE TAX LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED OR NOT. AT LEAST LET'S GET THAT INFORMATION NO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TODAY. ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR CLARIFYING NOT ANTI APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THEY THINK MUCH.

OTHERS MAY WANT TO MAKE A BIGGER DEAL ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE NEXT DEBATE TO FOLLOW WHETHER OUR TAX CODE IS FAIR IT TREATS ALL OF OUR CITIES FAIRLY AND THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE A SPIRITED ONE BUT LET'S AT LEAST DO IT WHERE WE HAVE THE FACTS ON THE TABLE FOR ALL OF US TO SEE. WHO THE WINNERS WHO ARE THE LOSERS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD OF THE WINNERS THEY'RE GETTING MORE THAN BILLION A BILLION AND WITH ONLINE SALES ROCKETING MAYBE MULTIPLE BILLIONS IN THESE KICKBACKS FROM SOME CITIES BUT LET'S SO LET'S GET THE FACTS SO WE CAN NOW HAVE THAT NEXT LEVEL I HOPE OF DEBATE. ABOUT OUR TAX POLICY IN THE STATE BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU MISS HAVING TO CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BURKE. HI BURKE AYE WIN. WINDOW GRAY. GRAYSON GRAYSON I. LIVING LEVINE I. MAYES MAYES AYE MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. HM OR SI QUIRK GROUP I RIVAS RIVAS ICY AREN'T SO. BILL PASSES SEVEN ZERO THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS SEVENTY I THINK YOU. RIGHT WHERE APPARENTLY THE SENATORS WERE CHECKING IN AND THEN GOING TO HEAD OVER THIS WAY WE WILL FOLLOW UP RIGHT NOW. WE ARE WAITING WHILE WE DO THE ABSENTEE CALLED ABSENTEES FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR MISSILE IN. GREAT LITTLE IN RETURN. THANK YOU ALL. IS THERE. TEXTED. OKAY CENTER WELCOME. IF WE NEED TO FILE ITEM SIX SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE SENATORS WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TWENTY TO BE HERE FIRST TIME BY THE WAY. SO SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WOULD SIMPLY PROVIDE PARITY THAT COUNTY SAID THE OPTION TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO ALLOW TAXPAYERS FOR SIXTY TWO YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OR WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME TO PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. NO MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS RATHER THAN TO LUMP SUMS. THIS WOULD BE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. FOR BOTH OF THE COUNTY AND THE TAXPAYER. HAS EXISTING LAW STANDS NOW PROPERTY TAXES ARE PAID INTO ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS EXCEPT IF AN OWNER IS IN DEFAULT. THE SYSTEM BECOMES A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WHEN HOMEOWNERS OWN THEIR PROPERTY OUT RIGHT ARE NO LONGER PAYING MONTHLY MORTGAGES AND HAVE NO IMPOUND ACCOUNTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR TAXPAYERS RELIANCE FIXED INCOMES SUCH AS THOSE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO. AND TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FOR DISABILITY. SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON FIXED INCOMES. TO PAY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE TAX DEADLY. THIS BILL IS TIMELY GIVEN THE INCREASED NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COUNTY THANKS TO RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. ONE SUCH OPTION IS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES FINANCE COMMITTEE CALLED EASY SMART PAY. IN COUNTIES THAT OFFER THE EASY SMARTPAY SOLUTION TAXPAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO CREATE AN EASY SMARTPAY ACCOUNT AND PAY PROPERTY TAXES MONTHLY WITH A CREDIT. OR DEBIT CARD. OR DIRECTLY FROM THE CHECKING ACCOUNT THERE'S NO COST TO THE COUNTY. NO COST TO THE COUNTY. I KNOW NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM FOR SOFTWARE. AS EASY SMARTPAY CAN INTEGRATE SEAMLESSLY WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS. IS THE SMARTPAY HAS BEEN IN THE PILOT PHASE FOR THREE YEARS AT CSX FINANCE COMMITTEE. AB SAY THEY PLAN TO HAVE THIS PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ALL COUNTIES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. JOINING ME ACTUALLY. TRACY ARE JOINING IN TO TESTIFY SUPPORT IS ALLEGRA FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEHALF THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE AND SCOTT KAUFMAN FROM THE DARK HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THEIR CONTENT THANK YOU WITH THE MODERATOR CONNECT US WITH THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE PLEASE. HELLO. HI THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BURKE AND MEMBERS I AM A LIQUOR FORTUNE IDEA MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO OF THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE IN ORGANIZATIONS SPONSORING THIS BILL WE WISH TO EXPRESS OUR VERY STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. B. SIX SEVENTY FIVE WHICH ALLOWS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE OPTION NOT THREE ANOTHER REQUIREMENT OF IMPLEMENTING A MONTHLY PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT PROGRAM THIS BILL IS MUCH NEEDED AND NECESSARY TO BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD IS IT IS AN OPTION TO THE BI ANNUAL PAYMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP HOME HOMEOWNERS MORE EASILY MANAGE THEIR PAYMENTS NOT ONLY FOR LOW INCOME IN OLDER ADULTS. BUT FOR ADULTS WHO ARE CARING FOR IN HANDLING FINANCES OF THEIR OLDER FRAIL OR DISABLED PARENTS SHE A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION CAN ALSO TAKE A HUGE BURDEN OFF CONSERVATIVES DO SHAREEF AND OTHERS WHO SERVE THIS POPULATION CREATING A SYSTEM WITH AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS HELPS THEM EASILY MANAGE PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS THIS BILL ALSO FURTHERS THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR'S. MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. IT NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE IS SILENT ABOUT THE METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION IT DOES NOT DIRECT ANY COUNTY TO UPGRADE OR REPLACE ANY EXISTING TAX COLLECTION SYSTEM. AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE C. FACT FINANCE CORPORATION AS CURRENTLY DEVELOPED THE PAYMENT. GATEWAY PLATFORM CALLED EASY SMART PAY THAT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS TO SET UP AUTOMATIC MONTHLY PAYMENTS. IT IS OPERATING WELL BEYOND ITS PILOT PHASE IN NINETEEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE EASY SMART. EASY SMART PAY DID NOT EXIST WHEN A SIMILAR BILL PASSED BOTH STATE LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND WITH VETOED BY THE THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN DUE TO PROCEED BECAUSE- CURRENTLY THE ONLY EXPENSE FOR COUNTIES IF THE DOCTOR WOULD BE ADDING THIS OPTION TO THEIR WEBSITE. AND ADVERTISING IS AVAILABILITY TO THEIR RESIDENTS I RESPECTFULLY AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR S. B. SIX SEVENTY FIVE. THANK YOU THINK YOU WOULD THE MODERATOR NOW CONNECT US WITH- THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY- DESPITE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WE CONTINUE TO GET CALLS EVERY YEAR FROM RETIRED SENIORS ON FIXED INCOMES ARE HAVING TROUBLE PAYING THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. THEY NEED ISRAEL AND THAT IS WHY SB SIX SEVEN FIVE IT'S SO IMPORTANT WELL THE AMOUNT PAID WOULD ULTIMATELY BE THE SAME PAIN IN SMALLER MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS WOULD BE MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE FOR THESE HOMEOWNERS TEND TO LUMP SUMS. FURTHER SB SIX M. FIVE IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA OTHER STATES SUCH AS IDAHO MICHIGAN OHIO AND TEXAS FORTY OFFER MONTH MONTHLY PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT PROGRAMS AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPOSE A NEW MANDATE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. COUNTY HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THEY ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY ON ABLE TO ESTABLISH A COMPUTER SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR MONTHLY MONTHLY PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS. BUT EASY SMART PIG THIS AND SB SIX SEVEN FIVE IT'S PERMISSIVE IN MERELY GIVES COUNTY THE OPTION TO DO THIS IF THEY SO DESIRE I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY PLEASE PRESS ONE NOW THAN THEIR- AT THIS TIME. AGAIN PLEASE PRESS. ONE NINE SEVEN ZERO. AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO SIT THAT TESTIFYING SUPPORT THE REMOTE VIDEO ROOM. SEEING NONE ANYONE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE. MODERATOR I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ONE PRIMARY WITNESS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AT THIS IS KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS IN OPPOSITION- ONCE AGAIN TO THIS PROPOSED MEASURE- I'VE HEARD DEFINITELY- THAT PROPONENTS EXPLANATION BUT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE. THAT YOU SMARTPAY HAS ALREADY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT- THAT'S NICE FOR E. S. P. BUT- THEY ACTUALLY CHARGED THE PARTICIPANTS TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT- ON EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION THAT'S NEED CREDIT CARD OR- THROUGH THE A CH THAT AUTOMATIC CLEARINGHOUSE. SO THEY'RE MAKING MONEY OFF OF PAIN PEOPLES- GETTING PEOPLE TAXES THE- BILLED MONTHLY THEY DO NOT HAVE A CUSTOMER SUPPORT NUMBER. AND AT THE END OF IT WHEN IT'S TIME TO PAY THE TAXES TO THE COUNTY THEY STILL PAID ON DECEMBER TENTH AND APRIL TENTH NOT BECAUSE COUNTY SYSTEMS WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON EXISTING STATUTE WHICH IS THAT THEY HAVE TO COLLECT THEM BY DECEMBER TEN AM APRIL TENTH. SO THEY MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND WHAT THE STATUTE TOLD THEM THEY NEEDED TO BE SET UP. AS AS FAR AS MONTHLY BILLING WHICH WEEK AND HAD A VERY LEAVES THE PHONE CALL WITH THE SPONSOR AN AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO GO THROUGH THE CHALLENGES WITH. IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL WE DO NOT AS THE TAX COLLECTOR'S OFFICE AND GET THE- WHAT NEEDS TO BE PRINTED ON THE TAX BILL UNTIL SOMETIME IN OCTOBER. OF THE YEAR BY WHICH THE DECEMBER TENTH PAYMENT NEEDS TO BE MADE SO ULTIMATELY IN ORDER TO BILL PEOPLE CORRECTLY THERE WOULD ONLY BE POTENTIALLY TWO BILLION CYCLES AT THAT. THIS WE WHEN WE GET THAT THE BILL FROM THE AUDITOR AND WHEN WE PRINT IT AND MAIL IT OUT SO. I WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A MONTHLY BILLING SYSTEM THAT WITH EVEN ACROSS ALL. TWELVE MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ALL YOU GOES UP EVERY YEAR FOR LUCKY AND- YOU KNOW VOTERS APPROVED PARCEL TAXES AND SUCH THAT RAISE THE COST OF THE TAX BILL AND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ON THERE UNTIL WE GET IT FROM THE OTHER. AND THAT WOULD GIVE US ONLY TWO MONTHS FOR THAT FIRST ONE EVEN. IF YOU SMARTPAY HAS TO TRUE- AT. AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO- IT CHANGES THAT YEAR SO HAVE TO DO THAT TO. I AS FAR AS DEMAND FOR THE PRO- IN PHILOSOPHY SO COUNTY WHICH IS A PARTICIPANT IN EASY SMARTPAY. THEY HAVE TWENTY SIX PEOPLE AND ROLLED. SO GOING TO THE COST THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN YES THE TREASURY TAX COLLECTORS AND IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY. I INVESTING IN SOME SORT OF OFFICE- OFFLINE TRACKING SYSTEMS. THAT WOULD THEN BE USED VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE THAT ARE USING THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY LARGE FEES. TO COVER THE COST OF THIS NEW PROGRAM BECAUSE COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S DON'T. CHARGE MONEY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE THE BILL WHAT THEY'RE TOLD TO BILL FOR SO. THEY HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT IT THE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE COLLECTING IS. WHAT FINDING. SCHOOLS SHERIFFS AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS PUBLIC HEALTH REGULAR HEALTHY. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE DONE IGHT- AND SO TRYING TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM WHICH LOOKS. LIKE A NICE THING TO DO FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND FOLKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY. THIS IS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST- OPERATING. COUNTY TAX COLLECTORS AND COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DO THIS IN FACT WE DON'T EVEN NEED LEGISLATION IF THEY COULD DO WHAT THEY WOULD DO IT. THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH. COMPLICATION WITH IT AND BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE STATUTE SAYS DECEMBER TEN AND YOUR FULL TIME SO. I RECOGNIZE IT'S YOU KNOW A TOUGH ISSUE TO SAY NO TO BUT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO PLEASE ABSTAIN OR VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. AND I NECESSARY TO BEGIN WITH BUT SECONDLY IT COULD HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT DOWN. DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS FOR COLLECTING TAXES THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE COLLECTED TO FUND CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICE. AND CAROLINE I CAN PRETTY MUCH I THINK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE AND- OPERATOR IF YOU WOULD OPEN THE LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL. OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. AND LADIES AND- IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY PLEASE PRESS.

SORRY ABOUT THAT MIND AND- THIS IS NOT LEVELING WITH THE STATUS UPDATE THIS PATIENT COUNTY AUDITORS- JUST BRIEFLY WANTED TO TACKLE THE COMMENTS OF. MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR'S WE'VE HAD A LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND YOU KNOW AGAIN NOT THE REPETITIVE THE WALLABY.

WELCOME SENATOR WE NEED TO FILE ITEM TO SB TWO SIXTY SEVEN WE'RE SORRY TO PULL YOU AWAY BUT THANK YOU. YOU ARE A LAST OFFICE OKAY. SO THE- CITY CALIFORNIA- HAS ADOPTED A POLICY SOME YEARS AGO. THE DEALT WITH INCENTIVIZING A SOLAR DEVELOPMENTS IN EXEMPTING THEM FROM. REAL ESTATE TAXES PROPERTY TAXES THE PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS TO. AGAIN TRY TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF INCENTIVE FOR. OUR GOVERNMENT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE LARGER POLICY ON RENEWABLES. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF FINANCING WITH HOW THE LAW WORKS. IN FINANCING JUST LIKE IN REAL ESTATE ANY REAL ESTATE DEAL WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A DEVELOPER WHO'S THE PROMOTER AND THE INVESTOR SO WHAT HAPPENS IS. THE WAY THESE DEALS ARE STRUCTURED IS WE GIVE A PREFERENCE TO THE INVESTOR TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK FIRST SO THEY KEEP TITLE TO THE PROPERTY AND THEN HE GETS TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE DEVELOPER ONCE THE INVESTORS EARNED THEIR RATE OF RETURN. WE SEE THIS IN ALL TYPES OF DEALS TO WHAT ARE CALLED TO IN TWENTY TERMS OF- MERCHANT BANKS AND THE LIKE IT AND SO THESE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. ON OUR THE WAY BUSINESS WORKS AND THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION COMES ALONG CRAZY CONFUSION WHICH IS LOOK CREATED A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKET PLACE I'VE INTRODUCED THIS BILL TO CREATE CLARITY IN TERMS OF HOW THIS FINANCING STRUCTURE HAS WORKED. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT INVESTORS HAVE CONFIDENCE GOING FORWARD AS FOR IPHONES. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO GO WITNESSES YET. PLEASE CONNECT AS WELL. I GOT TO VOTE THIS IS RICK I'M OFF FOR THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION AND A LADY IN FRONT OF THE GREATLY HUNTER. EDF RENEWABLES THANK YOU MODERATOR. THE LINE.

TO SIXTY SEVEN FIFTY TO SIXTY SEVEN OBVIOUSLY IT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR SB TWO SIXTY SEVEN. HOW WE ARE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE STRAW INDUSTRY I REPRESENTING- SOLAR COMPANIES ACROSS THE WHOLE VALUE CHAIN MEMBERS ARE INVEST ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY- SB TWO FIFTY SEVEN SEVEN SIMPLY CLARIFIES- THE STATUE PROBABILITY OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION AND A COMMENT SOLAR FINANCING STRUCTURE CALL THE PARTNERSHIP SLEPT. UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP WITH- AND THESE ARE USED TO FINANCE- BUT MOST SORE ENERGY SYSTEMS BUILT IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE ARE USED AS A WAY TO MAXIMIZE THE FEDERAL BACK ABOUT THE TAX CREDIT NEITHER KEY TAX MEASURES THAT YOU HELPED DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF SOLAR- AND- THE PARTNERSHIP WITH IS JUST A STRUCTURED YOU USED IT TO REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT. FOR CALIFORNIANS- AND THAT HAS REALLY HELPED MAKES ALONG ONE OF THE CHEAPEST SOURCE OF ENERGY ON ON CONNOR SO ACTUALLY TWO SIXTY SEVEN PROVIDE THE SIMPLE STOP STORY CLARIFICATION- THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CERTAINTEED SOLAR INVESTMENTS IN INSURANCE CALIFORNIA CAN REMAIN VOCAL LEADER NOT ABOUT MANY OF AN INSTALLATION OF SOLAR ENERGY. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND URGING HI FOLKS ON THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE- MODERATOR WE YOU CONNECT US. WITH EDF RENEWABLES PLEASE. YEAH DOING ANY HUNTER. GOOD ACTORS MADAM CHAIR NUMBER TELLING ON THE OF BOTH ET RENEWABLE AND EDP RENEWABLE LIKE RICK THE PART WITH CAN IMPORT TOOL FOR SILICON VALLEY CALIFORNIA- AT SENATOR HERTZBERG STATED BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HELD PASSED AB FIFTEEN ACTS- CONFIRMING- THIS LEGISLATORS INTENT RELATIVE TO THE USE OF THE PARTNERSHIP CLIP BUT WHEN THE BE A WE- PRODUCT GUIDANCE. IT LEFT A COUPLE OF THINGS A LITTLE UNCLEAR. SB TWO SIXTY SEVEN PROVIDE THAT CLARITY- WHICH IS MUCH NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR FULLER INVESTED TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN CALIFORNIA- WE THINK THAT TO SIXTY SEVEN AND A- SIMPLE BILL THAT DOES PROVIDE THAT CLARITY AND I TAKE SOME OF THE RISK OUT OF SOLAR INVESTMENT WHICH CAN HELP. LEAD CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE ITS ULTIMATE CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIXTY SEVEN TODAY THANK YOU MODERATOR WE PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TESTIMONY.

SEEING NINE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ONE PRIMARY WITNESS- IN OPPOSITION WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE CONNECT US WITH THE COUNTY OF KERN. HERE THIS IS LORALAI OBIANO REPRESENTING THE KERN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE KERN COUNTY PLANNING A NATIONAL RESEARCH DEPARTMENT WHICH FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT LIMITED THIS TO ONE PARTNERSHIP LEAD BUT WE ARE STILL CLOSE TO BEST SPELL. BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY CHANGES THE AGREEMENTS. THAT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THOUGHT WE HAD. WHEN WE APPROVED. FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF SOLAR. HE THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF SOLAR PAYS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND COUNTY GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTIONS BUT WILL PAY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE CERTAINLY THE PATHWAY 21100% RENEWABLE FOR CALIFORNIA. I REVIEWED ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE GREEN ELECTRONS ARE BOUGHT BY A VARIETY OF- UTILITIES AND POWER YOUR DISTRICTS. AND YET KERN COUNTY CANNOT GET THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT A NORMAL PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE. WE ARE ONLY ASKING FOR EQUITY. IF. IF THERE'S IF THIS AMENDMENT IS MERELY A CLARIFICATION THEN THE ASSESSOR'S ASSOCIATION WOULD AGREE WITH THAT AND THEY DO NOT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM MY LETTER HE THEREFORE WOULD LIKE TO ASK. THE SENATOR. AMEND THIS BILL FOR A LIMITED TAXATION REQUIREMENTS ON THE ONE PARTNERSHIP LET. ME ASK YOU COMMITTEE CHU NOT APPROVE THIS BILL WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A FULL ASSESSMENT. OF ALL COST UNDER THIRTY SUPPORT BUT THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO TO THE COUNTY. WE NOT ONLY HAVE FORTY THOUSAND ACRES ALREADY APPROVED YET ANOTHER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES IN PROCESS. FOR CONSIDERATION AND INCLUDE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY STORAGE WE PROVIDE OVER 50% OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR CALIFORNIA. IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CHAVEZ STREET WANTED TO GIVE UP EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE WILL BATTLEFIELD WE NEED TO HAVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TAXATION OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THE WORD OF THE WORD CHEAP GREEN ELECTRONS. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THEY ARE CHEAP BECAUSE KERN COUNTY DOES NOT GET ITS PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO- PROVIDE YOU THIS INFORMATION AND ONCE AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THE DOCTOR STARTED HER SUPPORT FOR THE AMENDMENT LIMITING TWO ONE PARTNERSHIP BUT- THANK YOU WE ARE COULD YOU POST THE BILL AS PREVENTATIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AT MODERATOR IS OR ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE LINE FORTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ROB GROWS CLOSER MAP THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION NOT TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT AND WITH THAT AMENDMENT WE HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION MODERATOR. THIS TIME IF THERE'S ANYONE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE NOW AND THEN ZERO. AND THERE IS NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION IN THE REMOTE VIDEO STATION AT THIS TIME. SEEING NINE ANY OPPOSITION HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE. OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN SEEN NONE SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD I'D LIKE TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUE FROM KERN COUNTY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS IT RELATES TO PUBLIC POLICY. FIRST OF ALL KERN COUNTY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THAT THE- NUMBER OF- SOLAR PANELS IN THE AMOUNT OF. EXPOSURE DOES IF THIS TAX STRUCTURE OF JUST FINANCING INVESTMENT STRUCTURE WAS PERCEIVED THE WAY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW SECONDLY THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS THEY'RE TALKING AS MEGAWATTS WHATEVER THE NUMBERS WERE. THE THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WOULD NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE INVESTORS WOULD NOT INVEST THE WAY THE FLIP WORKS AND THE WAY THE RISK PROFILE WORKS IN THESE SITUATIONS IS THAT INVESTORS INVEST THEY WANT THEIR MONEY BACK FIRST. THIS WAS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE BY BOARD OF EQUALIZATION RECENT INTERPRETATION THAT WAS NEVER IT THEY ARE RAISING A LARGER ISSUE. ABOUT HOW WE AS A GOVERNMENT CHOOSE TO SUBSIDIZE- SOLAR ENERGY AND TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE SOLAR EDGE I GET THAT AND I'M TOLD THAT THEY PROVIDES PUT JUST 53% FROM THAT COUNTY LEGITIMATE ISSUE. BUT IT'S NOT RELATED TO THIS MEASURE IT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS A LITTLE LEVERAGE JOB A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S OKAY YOU KNOW IT'S WORTH THE DISCUSSION WE'VE LIMITED TO ONE FLIP ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THE PURPOSE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. KEEP FLIPPING THESE THINGS ARE JUST TRYING TO LEGITIMIZE THE UNDERLYING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS SO. I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE IT I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION OUT AND IN A NUMBER OF FOLKS OF TALK TO ME ABOUT IT AND I GET IT. AND AS YOU KNOW WE DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS PLACE OFTEN THINGS CHANGE I REMEMBER WHEN THE INTERNET WASN'T TAXED AND THEN IT STARTED TO BECOME TAXED RIGHT BECAUSE THE CHANGE CHANGE AND THESE WILL CHANGE OVER TIME. AS WE MATURE AND DEVELOP THESE PROCESSES BUT WORD THAT INFLECTION POINT WHICH IS CAUSING THE FRUSTRATION SECOND THING I WANT TO TAKE EXCEPTION TO. IS MY EXTRAORDINARY- SPONSOR ON THE STILL ANY HUNDRED CALL THIS A SIMPLE BILL I'VE NEVER INTRODUCED A SIMPLE BILL IN MY LIFE I. SPOKE I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON RECORD THAT WE DON'T DO CIVIL BILLS BUT THAT EVENT WITH THAT I DESPERATE AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND TIME WHEN YOU CALL THE ROLL. BURKE I WE'RE ALL RIGHT WHEN. GREAT HI GREAT I. GRAYSON AYE LEVINE. I MEAN I MAYES HI MAYES I'M ALL IN. PETRIE-NORRIS PETRIE-NORRIS I LIKE WORK ON GROUP I RIVAS RIVAS I SAY ART OF MINE CLEARED A LOT. NINE ZERO NINE BILLS OUT NINE ZERO SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM THREE I WOULD BE FIVE THIRTY NINE. THANK THANK YOU I'LL MAKE IT BRIEF LAST YEAR- THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. CHAIR BURKE. ASSEMBLY BOWMAN FRIEDMAN GREAT SOME IMMIGRATION CENTER MAYES INTRODUCED ACA ELEVEN AFTER A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND AC ELEVEN WAS A PRETTY ELEGANT COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWED FOR PORTABILITY. OF PROPERTY TAXES OF SOMEBODY SAY WAS IN L. A. COUNTY HAVE THE HOUSE THEY BOUGHT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND IS OUR TWO MILLION THEY COULD MOVE TO EL DORADO COUNTY SOME OTHER PART OF THE STATE ALLOWED FOR PORTABILITY FOR SENIORS TO BE ABLE TO DO SUCH IT ALSO CREATED THE BENEFIT. OF UNLOCKING THAT TAX REVENUE FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY WAS PRETTY ELEGANT WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO CREATE PORTABILITY WITH THE REALTORS. WAS THAT IN THE COUNTIES THAT PEOPLE MOVE TO WHERE THE WHERE THAT THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX PAID WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OLD NUMBER IT BECAUSE CHALLENGES FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THE FIRE DISTRICTS SO WE CREATED YOU CREATED PART OF ALL OF US IN THIS LEGISLATURE ON TWO THIRDS BILL. AC ELEVEN WITH THE LEAD AUTHORS I JUST ARTICULATED AND IT PASSED BY VOTERS AS PROPOSITION NINETEEN. THAT WOULD ALWAYS HAPPENS IN THESE SITUATIONS IS THAT WOULD PROPERTIES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BY THE WAY. SO SOME PEOPLE ARE BELLY ACHING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE IT THEN GO BACK TO THE BALLOT CHANGES THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THE REQUIRED SOME CLARIFICATIONS AND- WHETHER IT'S INCONSISTENCIES WHICH HAVE TAKEN THE FOLKS IN THE ASSESSOR WORLD AND- THOSE FOLKS ARE. FREDDIE COULD SAID THAT THERE'S MY CHIEF OF STAFF HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF TIME IN MEETING AFTER MEETING. DEFINING A FAMILY FARM. DEALING WITH THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WE NEED THE CLARITY FOR. AND DEALING WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE THAT THE TREASURES DIDN'T LIKE THAT WE WERE GOING TO PUT THE REQUIREMENT OF PUTTING THE WEB ADDRESS ON THE FRONT OF AN ENVELOPE AND WE HAVE. TAKEN THAT AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THAT. SO THE MEMBERS THAT WE'VE TAKEN WHICH WE AGREE TO. OUR CLARITY AMENDMENTS CONSISTENCY AMENDMENTS. THE N. OPERABILITY AMENDMENTS AND CRAP AND QUITE FRANKLY AMENDMENTS THAT GIVE CERTAIN EMERGENCY POWERS TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. TO HELP WITHIN THE FRAME CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. TO IMPLEMENT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT THAT YOU ALL PUT ON THE BALLOT. THAT ASKS FOR NO VOTE WE HAVE. CHRISTY BAMA FROM THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.
