THANK YOU A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MR VICE CHAIR FOR PRESIDING WHILE I PRESENT THIS BILL. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT AB TWENTY ELEVEN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN HIGH ROAD JOBS ACT THE BILL SPONSORED BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND SUPPORTED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION BUSINESS GROUPS UNION CONTRACTORS ENVIRONMENTALISTS HOUSING DEVELOPERS CIVIC GROUPS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE BILL I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON THE STREET. 80% OF LOW INCOME TENANTS CAN ONLY PAY THE RENT IF THEY SACRIFICE OTHER BASIC BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD. EDUCATION HEALTH CARE. THE MEDIAN PRICE OF BUYING A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS NOW OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. MEETING THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE RICHEST CALIFORNIANS. POLLING CONTINUOUSLY SHOWS THAT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ARE CALIFORNIA'S TOP TWO CONCERNS. AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BUILD OUR CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WE REGULARLY BUILT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR. BACK THEN THOSE WERE HIGH WAGE JOBS THAT WERE INCREDIBLE PATHWAY TO A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE. NOW WE REGULARLY BUILD FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS YEAR UNLESS YOU WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE WORKING ON A PUBLIC WORK OR UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION JOB IT'S LIKELY OR WORKING IN LOW WAGES AND POTENTIALLY EXPLOITATIVE CONDITIONS. FINALLY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS RELATES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AS THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS I'M TERRIFIED OF WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR THEM. I NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM AS SOMEONE WHO IS IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT I DID EVERYTHING WITHIN MY POWER WHEN THEY WERE STILL TIME TO DO SO. AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE WHAT I CAN PRODUCE BOLD LETTERS BLOOD RELATION SAYING NECESSARY BUT UNCOMFORTABLE UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS TO PROMOTE THE HOUSING OF THE FUTURE HOW HOUSES NEAR JOB IN TRANSPORTATION THAT ALLOW US TO SLASH OUR CARBON EMISSIONS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. THIS BILL AIMS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS FOR MAKING IT MUCH EASIER TO BUILD HOUSING AT SCALE AND CLIMATE FRIENDLY FRIENDLY LOCATIONS. USING HIGHER LABOR STANDARDS THAT PROTECT AND UPLIFT OUR EXISTING WORKERS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY. GROWING A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF HIGHLY TRAINED WOMEN AND MEN. HOW WILL WE DO THAT. BY MAKING AFFORDABLE AND MIXED INCOME MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. A USE BY RIGHT IN AREAS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR. THING BUT WHERE IT IS. DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD. BY BEING BY RIGHT DEVELOPERS CAN MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THIS IS. SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF RED TAPE THAT INCREASES COSTS AND KILLS MANY VIABLE PROJECTS. WERE TAKING THE COST SAVINGS. OF ALLOWING HOUSING BY RIGHT AND GIVING IT BACK IN THE FORM OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND BETTER PAY FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. 5100% AFFORDABLE PROJECTS BRINGING DOWN THE COST MEAN. MAKE OUR PUBLIC MONEY GO FAR. FOR ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE REQUIRING THAT 15% OF THE UNITS WOULD NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE. TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OR 30% MODERATE INCOME FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP. THIS REQUIREMENT COULD RESULT IN AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF NEW AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHOUT REQUIRING PUBLIC SUBS. AS FOR WHERE THE HOUSING CAN GO IT WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT CURRENTLY ALLOW FOR RETAIL OFFICE BUILDING AND PARKING LOTS. FURTHER MORE MIXED INCOME HOUSING WOULD BE LIMITED TO COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS BASICALLY THOSE STREETS THAT IN THE MOST CITIES ARE LINED WITH STRIP RETAIL LOTS OF PARKING. THE PERFECT PLACE TO ALLOW A LOT MORE TO ALLOW A LOT MORE HOUSING ALLOW FOR COMMERCIAL USE WE ARE DIRECTING NEW HOUSING AWAY FROM SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR MIXED USE PROVIDING OPTIONS FOR RETAIL ON THE GROUND GROUND FLOOR FOR MORE VIBRANT WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. PROJECTS WOULD NEED TO MEET OBJECTIVE DESIGN STANDARDS TO EITHER ESTABLISHED BY THE BILL OR BY THE LOCAL CITY OR COUNTY. FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LABOR STANDARDS IN THIS BILL THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HIGHROAD HIGHLY PAID. CONSTRUCTION JOBS. ALL WORKERS WOULD BE PAID THE PREVAILING WAGE ENABLING ARE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN TO LEAVE MIDDLE CLASS LIFE. ALL WORKERS WILL BE PROTECTED FROM WAGE THEFT BY THE STRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STANDARD. ON RECORD. ONLY IF THE PROJECT IS FIFTY OR MORE UNITS THEY WERE. BRING A PER. THE I GREW UP IN A RACE TO LOOK PEOPLE. WE PUT ASIDE LISTS ALTHOUGH. TWENTY ELEVEN IS A BILL BUT OUR HOUSING CRISIS BOLD ACTION WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP HOUSING OUR HOMELESS KEEP TENANTS IN PLACE TO KEEP PROPERTY OWNERS FROM FOR CLOSING BUT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A FUNCTIONING MARKET PLACE WHERE HOUSING IS A BUNCH AFFORDABLE PEOPLE K. OPTION ABOUT TO HAVE WORK WITH A RANGE OF ALL. BACKGROUNDS THERE WILL PRO. THIS UP UPPING IT CLIMATE CHANGE AND UPLIFTING WORKERS WHO BUILD THESE UNITS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY AS RAY PEARL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM AND J. BRADSHAW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ALLOW MY JOIN AUTHOR MISTER GRAYSON TO. MARCH AS WELL. MISTER RAISING GOOD THANK YOU VICE CHAIR. THERE WAS A AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR THAT A AND ASSEMBLY HOUSING WORKING GROUP WAS PUT TOGETHER ASSEMBLED IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR THAT HOUSING WORKING GROUP MYSELF ALONG WITH TWENTY SEVEN OF MY COLLEAGUES- THROUGHOUT THAT TOUR- WOULD IT RANGE FROM CHEAP GO ALL THE WAY TO SAN DIEGO OVER TWENTY TWO NIGHTS ON THE ROAD. WE FOURNETTE THE LIST. AND WE DID AND- YEAH HERE WE DID AND THERE WERE A LOT A LOT OF- MEETINGS WHERE HOUSING OBVIOUSLY IT WAS THE CENTER AND CORPS OF DISCUSSION BUT A LOT OF EVIDENCE ALSO THROUGH SIGHT SEEING WAS WITNESSED AND THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THAT RESONATED FROM THAT HOUSING WORKING GROUP TOUR AND IT IS THIS THAT OUR HOUSING AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IS UNDENIABLY DIRE. AND THE CALIFORNIA AVERAGES FEWER THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS PER YEAR AND OUR STATE HAS NEVER IN ANY YEAR PRODUCED MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES THE LACK OF SUPPLY IN NEW DEVELOPMENT HAS PUSHED HOME OWNERSHIP FURTHER OUT OF REACH WORKING FAMILIES AND BECAUSE THE MEDIAN PRICE OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES TO SOAR B. EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS AN EX MORE IN ORDER TO SOME KEEP WITH THE DEMAND WHICH IS NOT REALLY ENOUGH TO ADDRESS TE CRISIS WE NEED TO BUILD ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS A YEAR INCLUDING EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS. AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE ARE FAR PASSED THE TIME APPROPRIATE TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS CRISIS BUT THE NEXT BEST TIME IS RIGHT NOW. BY JOINING AB TWENTY ELEVEN AS A JOINT AUTHORS THANK YOU TO- THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS I HOPE TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO GET. MORE OF THE HOUSES OR HOMES OUR COMMUNITIES NEED BUILT ESPECIALLY ON UNDERLIES CURRENT COMMERCIALLY ZONED LANDS AND ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS AND AT THE SAME TIME. I AM COMMITTED TO HAVING THE NEEDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS VALUED AND HEARD BECAUSE OUR HOUSING SHOULD OUR HOUSING GOALS SHOULD. BE A- AFTER. OF OUR HARDWORKING UNION WORKERS AND MY INVOLVEMENT AS A JOINT AUTHORS IT DOES ALLOW ME THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE SOLUTION THAT CEATES NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WHILE PROTECTING WORKER OPPORTUNITIES. BOTH OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY EAST CENTRAL TO THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND FUTURE THANK YOU. YOU MISTER GRAYSON WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH MANY WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RUSHER GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RAY PEARL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM. CHC IS A NONPARTISAN ADVOCATE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND PRESERVATION OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND COMMITTED TO THE GOAL THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME. DESPITE THE LEGISLATURE'S DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE A SHORTFALL OVER ONE MILLION HOMES AFFORDABLE TO THE STATE'S LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CHC HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT MATCH THE SCALE OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CHALLENGES. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY COMMITTED TO FINDING. COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND ACCESS TO WELL PAYING JOBS FOR WORKERS ALL OVER THE STATE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR CALIFORNIANS MOST VULNERABLE. IN THESE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE NOTED TO CRITICAL ISSUES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS. ONE WE BELIEVE THAT DEVELOPMENTS RECEIVING NEW LAND USE BENEFITS SHOULD CREATE STEADY WELL PAYING JOBS AND HELP BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE THAT EVERY COMMUNITY NEEDS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT PROJECTS CANNOT MOVE FORWARD IF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE A REAL AND GROWING CHALLENGE IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. IN OUR VIEW AB TWENTY ELEVEN FINALLY STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE AND FOR THAT REASON I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AB TWENTY ELEVEN PAIRS THE ABILITY TO BUILD HOUSING ON UNDER UTILIZED COMMERCIAL SITES WITH STRONG LABOR STANDARDS THAT ENSURE ALL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS EARN PREVAILING WAGES. AND EARNED HEALTH BENEFITS. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES DOUBLE OFF RAMPS THEY GIVES WORKERS IN STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THE FIRST SHOT AT THESE JOBS. THIS BILL ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OPEN THOUSANDS OF NEW SITES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO RAPIDLY ACCELERATE HOUSING PRODUCTIONS. AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND WE ARE PROUD TO STAND. WITH ALL OF YOU TO HELP SOLVE THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE.

MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL BUT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME PRIMARY WITNESSES WHO WISH TO COME UP. AND PRESENT. OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. YOU COME ON UP TO THE TABLE HERE. EITHER ONE OF YOU WHOEVER WANTS TO GO FIRST YOU MAY BEGIN. THE MORNING CHERO XMM BIRDS OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIN LEHANE I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION SKILLED IN IN CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INCLUDING SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND BUILDING TRADES APPRENTICES. IN STRONG OPPOSITION. TO AB TWENTY ELEVEN AS MOST OF YOU KNOW THESTATE BUILDING TRADES HAVE BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED IN HOUSING LEGISLATION FOR YEARS. IT IMPACTS OUR MEMBERS AS WORKERS ARE MEMBERS WHO NEED HOUSING AND OUR MEMBERS WHO LIVE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS LEGISLATION IN THIS BILL ALSO IMPACTS THAT THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WE DO NOT FORMALLY REPRESENT. BUT THE WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO PROTECT. LAST JUNE THE BERKELEY LABOR CENTER PUT OUT A STUDY THAT DOCUMENTED THE RAMPANT MISTREATMENT OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. INCLUDING THE PRACTICE OF UNDER THE TABLE PAY LACK OF WORKERS COMP AND THE NEARLY MAJORITY OF WHOM REQUIRE STATE FAMILY ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MEANWHILE PROFITEERING DEVELOPERS ARE MAKING BILLIONS OFF OF EXPLOITING A VERY REAL HOUSING CRISIS PROFITS THAT THIS BILL MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO LIMIT. AB TWENTY ELEVEN IS NOT GOING TO MATERIALLY ADDRESS THE HOMELESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS THIS BILL RESULT IN A FURTHER GENTRIFICATION OF WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES FOR PROFIT FOR MOSTLY MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT AND WILL EMBOLDEN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THE PAYS WORKERS LESSEN LEGAL WAGES AND PROFITS ON A BUSINESS MODEL THAT DOES NOT WANT WORKERS WHO ARE AWARE. OF THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS ON JOB SITES WERE TRAINED IN THE ACTUAL TRADE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO EXECUTE. THERE'S A LOT WRONG WITH THIS BILL THAT WE HAVE SET FORTH IN OUR LETTER. BEYOND THE GENTRIFICATION FOR PROFIT BUSINESS MODEL THIS BILL IS PROMOTING THIS BILL CLAIMS TO HAVE LABOR STANDARDS IT MIGHT AS WELL BE WRITTEN IN INVISIBLE INK IS ABLE DISAPPEAR BEFORE THE FIRST WORKER LACE UP THEIR BOOTS. WHETHER THIS IS INTENTIONAL OR NOT IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION AND DEPENDS ON WHO IS ACTUALLY. IN THE CURTAIN OF THIS BILL. THE BY THE WAY WAS PITCHED YEARS AGO TO US. BY THE FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE BEEN CIRCLING SHARKS FOR HEY. AND THERE'S CHUM IN THE WATER. THIS BILL IS AN AFFRONT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP IN THE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ENCOURAGE REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. SOLUTIONS GEARED TO BUILDING ACTUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND NOT PUT THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BUILDING IT INTO THE QUEUE FOR THE VERY HOUSING THEY'RE BUILDING. SEVERAL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS RESULTED IN BILLS THAT THIS EXAMPLE EIGHT INEXPLICABLY REFUSED TO BRING TO A FLOOR VOTE. LAST SESSION EVEN THOUGH IF IT HAD THIS HOUSING WOULD LIKELY BE UNDERWAY. BUT AGAIN THE SHARKS ARE CIRCLING AND THE HOLD UP IN THE ASSEMBY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HOUSING THE VULNERABLE IT HAS TO DO WITH A BUSINESS MODEL THAT DOESN'T QUESTION MILLIONS IN DEPTH DEVELOPER PROFITS AND IS THREATENED BY A WORK FORCE THAT KNOWS ITS TRADE. ITS RIGHTS AND IT'S WORTH. YESTERDAY AT THE RALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ONE OF THE PROPONENTS SAID THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT THEY CAN THEN LIVE IN. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. TRICKS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY SHOULD BE PAID AND TREATED COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR TRADE AND THEIR TRAINING. AND EARNED A PATH INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS NOT EXACTLY WHY ON BEHALF OF OUR NEARLY HALF A MILLION MEMBERS WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. ON AB TWENTY ELEVEN. YOU THE THIRD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- EDUARDO MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ELEVEN- AS MY SISTER FROM THE BUILDING TRADES JUST MENTIONED WE BELIEVE THE LABOR PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL ARE ILLUSORY THE LACK OF A REQUIREMENT FOR CONTRACTOR TO SUPPORT APPRENTICESHIP BY UTILIZING A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE MEANS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WORKERS WHO WERE DEEMED ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC ARE ONCE AGAIN LEFT OUT OF THE EQUATION. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING NO ONE IN THIS ROOM DISPUTES THE NATURE OF THE CRISIS WE FIND OURSELVES IN YOU WILL DISPUTE THE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS HOWEVER WE MUST REJECT THE FALSE CHOICE THAT AB TWENTY ELEVEN PRESENTS TO YOU TODAY THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE THIS CRISIS IS ON THE BACKS OF BLUE COLLAR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO THE BENEFIT OF BILLIONAIRE CORPORATE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WHO STAND TO BENEFIT FROM THIS GENEROUS BY RIGHT APPROVAL PROCESS A FORBIDDEN THIS BILL. WE ADDRESS STRONGLY TO THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN AB TWENTY ELEVEN WE MUST ALSO OBJECT TO THE PROCESS. WE BECAME AWARE OF THIS BILL A FEW DAYS BEFORE ITS INTRODUCTION AND WERE PROVIDED LANGUAGE FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE AUTHOR OR HEARST. WE KNOW WE ALL KNOW WE ALL KNOW WHEN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE INCLUDING THE AUTHOR ARE WELL AWARE OF OUR INSISTENCE OF A REQUIREMENT. THAT THE WORK FORCE BE SKILLED AND TRAINED AND YET WE'VE HAD REALLY VERY LITTLE- DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE DON'T DENY THE EXISTENCE OF A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WE WILL SPEAK OUT AGAINST PROPOSALS DEVELOPED ON THE BACKS OF WORKING PEOPLE. THE TWELVE HUNDRED AFFILIATES OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION STAND IN STRONG SOLIDARITY WITH THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTIONS CAGE TRADES COUNCIL. AND ASK YOU FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA GO TO. PEOPLE IN THE ROOM- THAT THAT WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE JUST STATE YOUR NAME. THE ORGANIZATION YOU REPRESENT.

SO I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME I'M GONNA START WITH MR GABRIEL OVER THERE. MISTER CARILLO. YEAH I THINK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO- I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN ON A SECOND AGO PRESENT APPROPRIATIONS BUT I AM. GOING TO BE ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE JOINT AUTHORS FOR BRING IT FORWARD- IT JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CAN OFTEN TIMES BE DIFFICULT TO WADE INTO COMPLICATED SUBJECTS AND THIS IS CERTAINLY IS ONE BYTE- THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT AND IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGES FACING US HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO RESOLVE. AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL HEARING ABOUT IN OUR DISTRICT IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THANK- PRINTERS AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FOR COMING TO THE TABLE. I KNOW THE COMPROMISE IS AN EASY. I KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS EASY- BUT I WAS EXTREMELY MOVED BY THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD WITH MY LOCAL CARPENTERS WHO CAME TO MY OFFICE YESTERDAY. BOTH ABOUT. HOW PASSIONATELY THEY FEEL ABOUT LABOR STANDARDS TO PROTECT WORKING PEOPLE. AND SOME OF THEM SHAREDSTORIES ABOUT FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE NON UNION CARPENTERS WHO HAD BEEN. INJURED AND THEN AND ABUSED AND ABSOLUTELY- EXPLOITED. AND HOW PASSIONATELY THEY FELT ABOUT THE LABOR STANDARDS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL- AND ALSO ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS. I TALKED TO FOLKS WHO GREW UP IN MY COMMUNITY. WHO CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE THERE. BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OUT OF CONTROL HOUSING CRISIS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN MY COMMUNITY. WHO WANT TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY. AND YOU CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO DO SO. AND I REALLY REALLY HOPE. THAT CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE- FROM MY VANTAGE POINT A LITTLE BIT BACK. I THINK IF WE ZOOM OUT THERE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR A WIN WIN. RIGHT WE CAN CREATE. GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS WITH. LABOR PROTECTIONS. THAT DESPERATELY NEED. AND WE CAN ALSO MAKE REAL PROGRESS ON OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND I. WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY MORE ROOM FOR CONVERSATION I KNOW WE HAVE- WONDERFUL PEOPLE AT ALL SIDES OF THE TABLE- PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THESE ISSUES DEEPLY WHO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT PROTECTING WORKERS IN ALL TO CARE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. AND I'M REALLY REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WITH YOU YOU CONVERSATIONS. WE CAN GET TO THE PLACE WE NEED TO BE BECAUSE- WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. IT THIS IS THIS IS THE MOST PERSISTENT. THANK ALSO. FACED IT'S NOT AN WE CAN WE CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE TO NOT MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE TODAY IT IS TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO YES I WANT TO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- AND THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR STARTING THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE CONVERSATIONS- BUT I AM VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I'M REALLY REALLY HOPEFUL THAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA FIND  WAY TO GET TO YES BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR WORKERS ARE RESIDENTS PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING CRUSHED BY AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT'S WHAT THEY DESERVE AND SO WITH THAT I LOOK FOR TO VOTING FOR THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. HOUSING HOMELESSNESS THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT WE FACE AND ALSO. MISTER GRAYSON FOR BEING HERE AS A AS A JOINT AUTHORS. AND REALLY TO BOTH THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE IS AT THE TABLE. I'M PART OF THE HOUSING WORKING GROUP THAT TOOK A TOUR ACROSS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT JUST. CONTINUES TO BE THE- ISSUE. OF THAT BASE AFFORDABILITY. EVEN FOR WORKERS EVEN FOR THE FOLKS ACTUALLY BUILDING THE HOMES AFFORDABILITY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS A PRIORITY IN A SHOULD BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY. AS WE MANAGED TO DEAL WITH ISSUES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE CHANNEL SO MANY FOLKS. I LIVE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. FOLKS ARE MOVING OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT BUT YET AS LOS ANGELES CONTINUES TO BUILD. FOLKS ARE MOVING OUT AND THEN HAVING TO DRIVE IN TWO HOURS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK EVEN IF IT IS. LOCAL HIGHER. AND SO IT'S ALL CONNECTED. BUT GEN. THEY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT TO MECHANICAL. A CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE AND IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO MAYBE HEAR FROM MR WATCH WHO I SEE IN THE AUDIENCE. TO SHARE US SPECIFICALLY. HOW THE MECHANICAL TRADES ARE IMPACTED- AND HIS POSITION ON THE BILL. OKAY SIR CAN YOU. SUM IT UP IN. A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. I'LL DO MY BEST THANK YOU- SCOTT WHAT'S YOUR BEHALF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTING ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. PRISON THEM FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT I SERVED AS A PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT TO THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE SO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HOUSING IN THIS BUILDING FOR QUITE SOME TIME- OUR UNIONS ABSOLUTELY RESPECT. THE PASSION THAT THE TWO AUTHORS HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS ISSUE. WE DON'T DOUBT. I DON'T DOUBT IN MY CLAYSTONE QUESTION THEIR SINCERITY. IN WANTING TO ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE ISSUES. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAME TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND WHY ALL THOSE WORKERS MANY OF WHICH ARE MY MEMBERS WHO CALLED IN OR APPEARED TODAY FELT SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THE PROBLEM WITH BY RIGHT. IS THAT IT TAKES AWAY THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE FOR WHICH THIS COUNTRY IN THIS LEGISLATURE WERE FOUNDED WHICH IS THE RIGHT FOR EVERY CITIZEN UNION COMMUNITY GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SEEK INPUT TO PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT AND TO SEEK REDRESS ON THEIR ISSUES B. THEM SMALLER BE THEY LARGE AND BY RIGHT COMPLETELY SILENCES THAT VOICE. IMAGINE IF WE HAD A PROCESS WHEREBY. WE DEEM SOME ISSUE SO SIGNIFICANT. THE WE DECIDED TO BY PASS LEGISLATURE. AND WE JUST SAID NO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T GET A VOTE ON THIS IT'S TOO IMPORTANT WE'LL JUST LET THE GOVERNOR DECIDE. I THINK. THIS INSTITUTION WOULD STAND UP AND SCREAM. HAVING SAID THAT. WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE. THERE CAN BE A MEETING OF THE MINDS. THERE WE GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THE ROOM AND HAVE- A MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND PERHAPS. WAS ALLOWED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE. SO MY HOPE ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENTS WOULD BE THAT. IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THAT IT WERE TO GO TO- A PLACE WHERE WE COULD HAVE THAT DISCUSSION RATHER THAN YOU KNOW HAVING A BACK UP AGAINST A WALL WITH HAVING A BABY SCHEDULED IT APPROPRIATIONS IN A WEEK AND THEN ON TO THE FLOOR WORD THOSE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS BECOME MORE TO- AND- YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED ON LOT OF TOUGH. WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL IN THE PAST AND WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN TOO GOOD PLACE. A AND- IT SO THAT'S WHAT THAT MY CLIENTS WOULD HOPE WOULD HAPPEN TODAY- BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE. WHAT YOU'E DOING WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT. FOR ALL THESE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO GO BEFORE THERE'S LOCAL CITY COUNCIL. IT RAISES ISSUES AND- HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. IN WAGES IN OUR WAY WE IN WAGES AND WAGE PACKAGES ARE NOT THE ONLY ISSUE. THAT- WORKING MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SO. I HOPE THAT YOU QUESTINS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPER SIR. THANK YOU MISTER WATSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OR FOR THE INDULGENCE- BUT CHAIR WORKS BASED ON. THE COMMENTS MADE- AND IN PARTICULAR COMMENTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION AND IN PARTICULAR- MISTER WHICH IT IS IT DOES APPEAR THERE ARE. SOME WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE FOR SOME SOLUTIONS- CURIOUS IF WITH THAT YOU WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE BILL TO MOVE THE BILL TO ROUTE TO RULES COMMITTEE FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS- I APPRECIATE THE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS HERE MISS CARILLO AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY MR WATCH IN TERMS OF WHERE HIS. HIS UNION I AM- WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL TO RULES- TEMPORARILY THOUGH AND TO ALLOW FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS- WITH MISTER WELCH WITH THE TRADES AND OTHERS- ALONG WITH MY SPONSORS OF COURSE- C. H. C. AND THE CARPENTERS. IF WE CAN REACH A COMPROMISE ON ON LABOR STANDARDS I'M ALL ABOUT IT I WANT TO HAVE MORE ENGAGE CONVERSATIONS BUT I'LL SAY I'M ONLY GOING TO AGREE TO THIS- IF MY BILL IS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE TIME. IN THE TIME LINE ALLOWED TO BE HEARD IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PRIOR TO FISCAL COMMITTEE DEADLINE IN THE BILL KEEPS MOVING FORWARD. ON THE REGULAR CALENDAR AND GETS OUT OF PRISON TIME TO GO OVER THE SENATE. WITH THOSE STIPULATIONS- I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE MOTION THAT YOU SUGGESTED I WELCOME I'M OPPOSITION INTO THE CONVERSATION- IF WE MOVE THE BILL IF IT PASSES OUT OF COMMITTEE INTO ROLES- IN AN ACT OF GOOD FAITH TO REALLY TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN REACH SOME OTHER COMPROMISE LANGUAGE HERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THERE'S A LOT WILLINGNESS TO COME TO THETABLE COLLAB AND IMPORTANTLY TO SEEK SOLUTIONS AND NOT JUST SAY NO NO NO BUT ACTUALLY FIND A RESOLUTION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL INTO THE COMMITTEE OF RULES. OKAY SO WHERE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL INTO THE COMMITTEE RULES. SO IT'S DO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE RULES. OKAY TO HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND BY WARD RIGHT THIS QUIRK-SILVA HE WONDERED COMMENT. THERE'S A LOT TO SAY AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT AND- AS SO MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT. ALL OF US WHO SIT HERE ON HOUSING COMMITTEE I HAVE SPENT HOURS LOOKING AT VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION ALL WITH THE HOPES TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T MOVED FORWARD ON THE GOAL TO GET PRODUCTION AND THIS HAS ELUDED US- AND IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA TODAY ON NPR THERE WAS A OF. A REPORT ABOUT ACROSS. I'M ACTUALLY THE UNITED STATES AND HOW MUCH ATTAINING A SOME TYPE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS BECOMING. NOT THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH UNITS BUILT THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING AS WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE READY TO MOVE FROM UP RENTALS INTO. HOUSING AND SOME WHO MOVED IN WITH THEIR PARENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC NOW HALF. THE READ THIS IS TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT BUT AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EVEN WITH THOSE RESOURCES THAT THEY MAY HAVE SAVED THERE AREN'T THE UNITS AVAILABLE. THIS JUST HAPPENED TODAY THIS MORNING MY TO ON NINE YEAR OLD SON- CALLED ANY WANTED ADVICE- IT BECAUSE HE IS LOOKING FOR A RENTAL. AND THERE WERE TWO CHOICES BOTH FOR A TWO BEDROOM AT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED NOW IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND HIS QUESTION WAS YOU KNOW WHICH ONE DID I THINK WOULD BE BETTER AND SO THINGS LIKE PARKING THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO PARKING ALL OF THESE BUT THIS IS. ONE PERSON LOOK IN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SAID LAST YEAR WAS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR UNIT. SO IN ONE YEAR THOSE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR UNITS HAVE NOW GONE UP TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED IN SOME LOCATIONS- BUT IT IS. KIND OF HEART WRENCHING TO SEE A FRIEND FIGHT BECAUSE THIS THE TRADES AND THE CARPENTERS ARE OFTEN ON THE SAME- TEAM AND I THINK THAT- BUT MOVING THIS TO. RULES COULD GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE TABLE I WOULD SAY THOUGH AND IN. MANY WAYS. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BY RIGHT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HATE BY RIGHT- NIMBIS HATE BY RIGHT MANY PEOPLE HATE BY RIGHT BUT WHY WOULD THE STATE TAKE THIS STEP IS THE QUESTION WHY WOULD THERE BE A BILL TO PUSH HOUSING TO A POINT WHERE IT IS AT BY RIGHT AND IT SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUILDING WE HAVE NOT BEEN BUILDING AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY MANY MANY PRODUCTION BILLS THAT GET STUCK EVEN IF THEY GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THEY GET OFF THE FLOOR. THEY GET KILLED IN APPROPRIATIONS AND IT'S HAPPENED OVER AD OVER AND OVER SO WHEN SOME OF OUR FRIENDS WHETHER IT BE FROM THE TRADES OR IN CARPENTERS SAY YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WE HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO SAY YES SOMETIMES TWO BILLS THAT WOULD PUT US IN A FRIEND FIGHT AND I BELIEVE ME IT'S THE LAST THING WE WANT TO OR I SHOULD SPEAK FOR MYSELF WANT TO DO IS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE- A FIGHT. WE KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TO US PERSONALLY BUT I CANNOT STAND BY AND NOT SAY YES TO HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR ME IT'S A MORAL DECISION WHEN WE SEE AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS TO CONNECT HOMELESSNESS TO HOUSING. IT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I'M SORRY BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO FOR THAT ARE ON THE STREETS. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH MEANS HOUSING PRODUCTION THEY'RE GOING TO STAY THERE WE CANNOT HAVE PEOPLE LIVING THREE AND FOUR YEARS IN SHELTERS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING THOSE SHELTERS WERE BUILT FOR SIX MONTHS MAYBE A YEAR NOW WE HAVE NO PLACE TO MOVE THEM SO. I WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS WITH THE TRADES IN THE CALL CENTER SO I WILL SUPPORT AND INITIATIVE I PRAY LITERALLY PRAY- THAT SOME PROGRESS CAN BE MADE. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A TEAM APPROACH HERE BUT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS WE HAVE TO BUILD AND WE HAVE TO BUILD WITH URGENCY AND WE HAVE TO BUILD. FASTER BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU. MR WARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR WORKING SO HARD ON BRINGING FORM- AND BRING FORWARD- THE TEMPLATE MODEL I THINK HERE FOR MAYBE HOW WE CAN PROCEED FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF HOUSING RELATED QUESTIONS NOW- AND INTO THE FUTURE- LEVERS AT ISSUES ASIDE I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR FOCUSING ON COMMERCIAL OFFICE UP PARKING AND OTHER UNDER UTILIZED SPACES THAT WE KNOW ARE TRANSFORMING NOW LITERALLY IN THIS DECADE IN THIS MOMENT ON THAT WE NEED TO THINK MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO OFFER DENSITY OUR- THESE IN PLACES THAT ARE PEOPLE ALREADY ARE THAT THAT THE DEVELOPMENT ALREADY IS AND HOW WE ARE. REIMAGINING OUR ART AND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE-WAY SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING HOLDS LEADERS TRY TO TACKLE BEFORE AS WELL- BUT FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOCUSING ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO OFFER A LARGE CAPACITY OF OPPORTUNITY SITES ON THAT THAT REALLY WILL CATALYZE A LOT OF HOUSING THAT OF COURSE WE NEED IN FOR FOCUSING AND TRACKING THIS ON THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL SO YOU KNOW WHAT DOES STANDARDS AND OF COURSE THEN- THE BEGINNINGS OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ELEVATING LABOR STANDS AS WELL AS JUST INCREDIBLY COMMENDABLE- FOR BRINGING. TOGETHER THIS. ON ON ALL. THIS TO THE POINT YOU KNOW. I AGREE AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE AT ALL. HAVE INCOME- TO DATE FOR WRITTEN YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO ELEVATE PREVAILING WAGE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS WANTED. FOR A VERY LONG TIME- BECAUSE OUR WORKERS DESERVE IT. AND BE ABLE TO START TO PUT IN HEALTHCARE AND- APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AND A LOT OF OTHER LABOR. NEEDS THAT ARE IN HERE IS- YOU KNOW LEAPS AND- NONE. LEAPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I'M WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT RIGHT AND YOUR DOUBLE BEING IN THE DETAILS I AGREE WITH YOU CHAIR WICKS- THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T I'M STUCK SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT. IT GOING FOR THE RULES AS WELL- BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS ARE COMING TO THE TABLE THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES- BECAUSE- ANOTHER YEARS DELAY IS NOT- ACCEPTABLE- MINE YOU. HAVE IN HERE IF WE ARE. ENTERING THIS **** FURTHER NEGOTIATION AND CONVERSATIONS- I DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE SEPARABILITY CLAUSE. AND THAT IF WE ARE. CONNECTING UP A LOT OF THESE STANDARDS TOGETHER THIS NEGOTIATION- I I'M DEEPLY-CONCERNED THAT- WHETHER IT'S THROUGH HEALTH CARE OR THE NEED TO HAVE A- STAND. ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BUILT IN HERE- MONEY- SUBSEQUENTLY FALL OUT AND NOT LEAVE SOMETHING. WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED- THAT IS NOT BENEFITING THE WORKERS- IT IT UNDERCUTS THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE ALL SINCERELY. TRYING TO NEGOTIATE SO I HOPE THAT I CAN GET ON THE TABLE AS YOU ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT THE TECHNICAL DETAIL MATTERS. THE SECOND ISSUE FOR ME. THE PROFESSION SO SCREENS THAT ARE GOING INTO THE EVENTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THESE UNITS THAT WE THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE THAT REALLY REQUIRED YOU JUST SKILLED THE SORT. THE PROFESSIONAL- EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO GET RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO DELIVER. HOUSING PRODUCT THAT- IN THAT IS GOING TO. BE PERFORMED BY SUBSTANDARD WORK ON THAT MAKE SURE ESPECIALLY WHERE HEALTH INS AND ESPECIALLY SAFETY YOUR CONCERN. ON THAT FOR THE EVENTUAL OWNERS TENANTS- BUT THAT IS CONSIDERED AN OF COURSE- FOR THE LEVER THAT IS PERFORMED THAT THAT WORKER STANDARDS AS WELL- ARE UPHELD SO THAT- PEOPLE JOBSITES WITH SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS AS WELL. A LOT- YOU KNOW ABOVE DETAILED WORK ON BUT I THINK THAT YOU WILL HAVE A PUT SO MUCH TOGETHER. AS AN AREA OF FOCUS THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT. LET'S GET TO THAT AGREEMENT THIS YEAR- AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MATT CHAIR- FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS LOOK YOU KNOW- I A REPRESENTS SAN JOSE THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY- IT. A SUPER MILLIONAIRE IS AS SOMEONE THAT HAS A NET WORTH WERE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. SAN JOSE HAS MORE SUPER MILLION HIGHER DENSITIES MILLIONAIRES THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD. AND YET IN THE WHAT ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST CITIES ONE OF THE IN THE WEALTHIEST REGION THE WEALTHIEST STATE. THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH THERE ARE THOUSANDS LIVING ON THE STREETS- THERE ARE MANY MORE THOUSANDS. THERE ARE VERGE OF. BEING DISPLAY- THE THEIR HOME. LOSING THEIR APART. JUST JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND THREE OF THREE WEEKS AGO OR SO. I WAS WALKING AROUND- THIS LARGE OTHERWISE OF WHAT USED TO BE AN EMPTY LOT HUGE FIELD NEAR THE AIRPORT THE NOW HAS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LIVING THERE- IN THEIR CARS AND RV'S. AND THE REALITY IS THAT INACTION IS NOT AN DIFFERENCE IS CRUELTY- THAT BEING SAID. WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A CIRCULAR ISSUE. THAT WHEN WORKERS ARE TREATED WELL THEY ARE NOT PAID WELL WHEN THERE'S A WAGE THEFT WHEN- THEIR SUBSTANDARD WORKING CONDITIONS DOES THE SAME WORKERS- THAT SUFFER FROM LACK OF HOUSING THAT SUFFER FROM A LACK OF AFFORDABILITY. THE SILICON VALLEY- IS A IS A AS GOOD OF AN EXAMPLE OR AS BAD OF AN EXAMPLE OF THERE'S DEFINITELY A GOOD THING. AS ANYWHERE ELSE. AND BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE. WRONG LABOR STANDARDS IS WHAT YOU SEE IS ALEVE WHEN SHE WAS THAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE SILVERY TOWERS WHICH NICKNAME SLAVERY TOWERS WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE SEEN THE DEVELOPERS THE MILLIONS OF SUBJECTS SUBSIDIES WERE YET THE WORKERS THEY FOUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING SLAVE LABOR WORKERS WERE KEPT CAPTIVE IN WAREHOUSES PRO CUTS IF YOU DOLLARS TAXPAYER ATTEMPT YOU TO SHOW CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY WENT TURN SUB STANDARD LAID- ALMOST HOUSING FOR. WITH PROJECT TURNKEY I WAS ACTUALLY THERE HOME WITH AND- IT WAS OPEN THE GOVERNOR WAS THERE FIND OUT LATER. THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS A PROJECT LED MILLION DOLLARS A STATE AND CITY FUNDING. THAT HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS ARE MET PAGE STUFF THERE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ACCOUNTABILITY. OF ALL IS HAPPENING ON THAT SIDE. AND SO- I MENTION ALL THIS BECAUSE I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT THESE ARE. NOT COMPETING INTERESTS- THESE ARE MORAL ISSUES THAT ARE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE AND SHOULD BE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO EVERYONE. ABOUT HAVING HOUSING HAVE HAVING PEOPLE WITH THE DIGNITY OF HOUSING HAVING PEOPLE THE DIGNITY OF- OF WORK AND WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE END OF A LIVING WAGE AND. AND THAT WHEN JURISDICTIONS SPECIALLY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THAT- THE BY PRODUCT IS- LABOR TRAFFICKING THE BY PRODUCT IS SUB STANDARD CONSTRUCTION. AND SO- I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO FIND. A WAY. TO RECOGNIZE OUR COMMONALITIES ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CARRY ON AND FIND A WAY- THE TO THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE- UP TO FORTY COME TOGETHER ON THOSE AREAS WHERE- THERE'S- BEEN DISAGREEMENT. I DON'T CARE HOW LONG THE DISAGREEMENTS BEEN THERE- I THINK THAT IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT RIGHT AND THE BEST WE CAN- AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT IN TALKING WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND- CONCERNS WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH FOR THE STRONG ENOUGH APPRENTICESHIP LANGUAGE OR ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE THEIR SENSE. I AGREE WITH SOME OF THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT IF WE JUST GIVE UP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MY UNFORTUNATELY MY CITIES AN EXAMPLE WHAT HAPPENS YOU JUST LEAVE IT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE JUST IN A MAD RUSH TO BUILD. AND THEY GIVE ALL THESE OF THIS MONEY AWAY TO DEVELOPERS TO BUILD- AND THE END RESULT IS ALWAYS PLEASANT IN FACT THAT'S WHY DID A BILL WITH THE BUILDING TRADES A FEW YEARS BACK TO DEFINED MINIMUS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING PUBLIC SUBSIDIES- THAT THAT WE HAVE BETTER STANDARDS AND PREVAILING WAGE WHAT HAVE YOU- AND SO. YOU KNOW WITH THIS BECAUSE OF THOSE BOTH NOBLE AND RIGHTEOUS COMPETING INTERESTS. BUT WHAT I HAVEN'T STRUGGLED WITH IS MY BELIEF. IN THIS IS THIRTY THE AUTHOR- OF. NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDING THE URGENCY. OF OUR- OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT- BUT I WITH A BECAUSE I USED TO SAY OURS ABOUT THE MOST IN THE BAY AREA BUT REALLY IT'S NOT EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE- MAYBE SOME DEGREES. BUT I THINK YOU CAN. BUT EVERYWHERE. I'M. AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY CONVERSATIONS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OF LATE- WHETHER THERE OF LATE OR OR NOT THEY'RE HAPPENING- AND THE OF A REFERRAL TO RULES TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CONTINUED- MEANINGFUL UP A DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- ON THESE ISSUES BUT PUTS A LOT OF US IN DIFFICULT POSITIONS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT THAT UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE HOUSING ISSUE WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO STAND WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS LABOR. AND YOU KNOW I AM I AM COMMITTED TO THE BEST IMPOSSIBLE FINDING THAT PATH FOR BOTH AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ACHIEVABLE WHEN YOU MATTER HOW MY HEART BE TRY BUT WE HAVE TO TRY HARD. AND WE HAD A BIT AND I HAS TO TRY BECAUSE- PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. IT AND I SEE IT EVERY DAY- IN A PLACE WHERE THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING. IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE SUFFERING- IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULDN'T HAVE WORKERS WORKING IN NEAR LIKE SLAVE CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD HAVE WASTE AFTER THEY APPRECIATE THE WAGE THEFT- COMPONENTS OF THIS- AND AGAIN ABOUT HOW TOUGH THE COMPONENTS ARE THE ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NEED TO BE EQUALLY AS STRONG AND SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I BELIEVE. CAN BE WORKED OUT WHETHER THEY WILL BE WORKED OUT OR NOT IS UP TO ALL OF US- IT IT'S UP TO ALL OF US SINCERELY WANTING TO FIND A SOLUTION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHILE WE DELAY- THERE'S A LOT OF SUFFERING THAT'S HAPPENING AND I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO THAT SUFFERING BUT I FEEL IT- BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT MY COMMUNITY. MANY OF WHOM I KNOW- THAT THAT ARE SUFFERING THROUGH THIS AND SO I JUST IMPLORE AND I PRAY THAT- ALL OF US GOING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO COME TO THE TABLE TO WHATEVER EXTENT I CAN BE HELPFUL- TO HELP US GET THERE. BUT I DO APPRECIATE- OF THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE THE BUILDING TRADES OTHER OPPOSITION THAT REACH OUT AND HAVE. MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION BUT- THEY HAVE A VERY SINCERE- UP. DESIRE TO REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS I THINK THEIR THEIR- THEIR THEIR OPPOSITION COMES FROM A PLACE OF SINCERITY AS WELL- AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SINCERE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. THAT THAT THAT WANT TO FIND A PLACE OF COMMON GROUND. I THINK IT'S ACHIEVABLE AND SO- I HOPE WE CAN GET THERE- I'LL BE SUPPORTING. THE BILL TODAY- AND I HOPE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL. GET THERE SO THANK YOU ALL. SO I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS BEFORE WE GO BACK TO THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW I COME FROM A DISTRICT IT HAS NEWER COMMUNITIES- COMMUNITIES BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND ARE NOW. EXPERIENCING THE GROWTH. THAT OCCURRED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND OVER IN L. A. COUNTY AND IN THOSE AREAS- ONE OF THE- PROBLEMS I SEE WITH OUR APPROACH NOT NECESSARY JUST WITH THIS BILL BUT OUR APPROACH IN GENERAL IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIX AND FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THIS CRISIS IN URBAN AREAS. AND URBAN AREAS WERE BUILT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND YES THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND THEY DIDN'T ENJOY THE BENEFITS OR HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CREATING GENERAL PLANS AND HAVING ZONING AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS- AND NOW THINGS NEED TO CHANGE M. WHAT USED TO WORK BACK THEN WHEN IT WAS ALL INDUSTRIAL AND- PEOPLE WERE BUILDING THINGS. NEEDS DO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SIT EMPTY AND THOSE NEED TO GO OUT AND OUR NEED IS HOUSING. AND SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE URBAN AREAS. ARE THE ONES WHERE WE'RE FOCUSINGSOME OF OUR A LOT OF OUR EFFORTS ON. AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT HAMPERING THE EFFORTS OF SUBURBAN AREAS. TO INCREASE AND GET THEIR HOUSING BUILT BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM HAVE THE PLANS FOR HOUSING BUT THEY'RE RUNNING INTO OBSTACLES. THAT CREATE- DELAYS IN TRYING TO GET THESE ON THE GROUND- I WAS ON A CITY COUNCIL THAT APPROVED A- AFFORDABLE HOUSING- COMPLEX WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND EVEN IT'S STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. IN THE PROCESS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HEAR US. NECESSARILY YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE'RE CHANGING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS BECAUSE OUR CAR WON'T START. IN THE PROCESS ITSELF IT IS CREATING THESE DELAYS THE CREATE THE COST. AND FRANKLY I AGREE WITH EVERYBODY I WOULD RATHER BE SPENDING A LITTLE MORE MONEY. ON THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THEN I WOULD FIND CARRYING COSTS STUDIES THAT ARE REDUNDANT. AND THESE DELAYS- THAT OUR OUR AGENCIES AT ALL LEVELS STATE LOCAL FEDERAL AND LOCAL ARE AND I COUNTY. ALL ALL THOSE ALL HAVE AGENCIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS TO GET SOMETHING THROUGH THIS THIS DEVELOPMENT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THEY WAITED TWO YEARS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT FOR THAT WE HAVE MONEY THAT WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE TAKEN TWO YEARS TO JUST GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IN THE MEANWHILE COSTS HAVE SKYROCKETED FOR MATERIALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE HAVE A LABOR SHORTAGE BECAUSE- WE WENT FROM BUILDING A LOT OF HOMES BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. TO CREATING A BUNCH OF REGULATIONS TO SLOW THAT DOWN WHAT WE SLOWED IT DOWN. AND AS THAT SLOW SLOW PERIOD CAME WORKERS WHO USED TO BUILD HOUSES HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HAD TO FIND OTHER TYPES OF WORK TO GO INTO. NOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF LABOR. AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH UP BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST APPROVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH FLAVORS FOR THE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND YOU KNOW I WOULD BE REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS. IF WE WOULD TAKE THIS AREAS AND I CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THEM AND THEN TAKE THE URBAN AREAS AND CREATE THAT CHANGE FOR THOSE AREAS CREATE THE MECHANISMS TO CREATE THAT CHANGE HAVE A LOT OF LAND THAT IS ZONED WHICH INCLUDES THIS SO THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT PROCESS TO DO THAT BUT WE'RE CREATING A MECHANISM HERE WHERE THEY CAN GO INTO THE COMMERCIAL AREA. AND JUST BUILD BY RIGHT. WE SHOULD DO BETWEEN THAT AND THE OTHER WHERE IT'S RESIDENTIAL WORDS DON'T FOR BECAUSE IN THE GENERAL PLAN OF A COMMUNITY OF THESE NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GROWING. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE TAKING A CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE YOUR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE EFFORTS THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO. IN IN OUR URBAN AREAS THE REASON THEY'RE HAVING TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PLANNED OUT VERY WELL. AND SO YEAH YOU HAVE TIRE STORES NEXT TO A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING AND SO WHAT DID THEY GET TO LISTEN TO THEY GET THE LISTEN TO. THE IMPACT WRENCHES IN THE TIRES BEING CHANGED IN CARVER YOU KNOW ALL THE NOISE AND ALL THE ADVERSE IMPACTS THAT COME FROM BEING NEAR A STORE LIKE THAT. SO WE'VE SEPARATED THOSE ALL OUT WE'VE HAD TO DO IT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH PROCESSES OF AIR TRAFFIC SCHOOLS WATER RUN OFF HABITAT ECONOMIC BALANCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BALLOTS. AND THE JOBS AND HOUSING BALANCE. WE WERE TOLD AS CITIES YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD HOUSES YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD COMMERCIAL YOU HAVE TO BUILD A BALANCE OF THEM SO THAT THE PEOPLE THAT MOVING THE HOUSES HAVE A PLACE TO WORK. WELL WE'RE TAKING THOSE OFF LINE. THEY'VE GOT TO BE MADE UP SOMEWHERE IN THE GOING TO BE MADE UP IN THE NEXT GENERAL PLAN BECAUSE THE NEXT JOURNAL PLAN. IT HAS TO BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS HAS TO BE. IN BALANCE WITH WHAT YOU'VE CREATED. SO THEY'RE GONNA WIND UP TAKING OTHER AREAS THAT ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR THIS OUT. IN THOSE SUBURBAN AREAS. SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT THIS NOT NOT BECAUSE OF THE- THE ISSUES WITH WITH THE LABOR ALTHOUGH I. YOU KNOW I HOPE THEY CAN GET THAT ALL IRONED OUT. BUT BECAUSE I COULD SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT WOULD CREATE ZONES WHERE THIS IS THIS APPLIES AND IT WORKS. AND IT'S USABLE. AND AND ALSO IF WE START REFORMING THE PROCESS. THAT HAS CREATED THIS CRISIS. IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT INSTEAD OF EXEMPTING THIS FROM C. QUITE AND THAT FROM CIGNA AND THEN THAT FROM SIKA. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAXICABS. WE NEED TO EVALUATE IT SO IT COMES INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WITH WHAT WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE TODAY. AND THERE ARE TRADE OFFS TO BE MADE AND WE DO AND WE ARE TRADING RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRADING OFF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE STREET THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FOR A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED DESPERATELY BUT NOBODY WILL TOUCH. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE MY FEELINGS ARE ON THIS IS YOU KNOW I IT IS GREAT IDEAS GREAT INTENTIONS IT'S NOT GONNA FIX THE PROBLEM. AND UNTIL WE START FIXING THE PROBLEM I RECOGNIZE THAT. OUR PROCESS IS THE PROBLEM LET'S ATTACK THAT. DAN ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF IS JUST IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE BOOKS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN TEN YEARS. WE WON'T BE HERE BUT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE GOING HEY WHAT THE HECK ARE THOSE GUYS DOING. SO YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD SAY WE NEED A LOT MORE WORK ON THIS. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT WORKABLE. FOR ALL AREAS TO URBAN AREAS THE SUBURBAN AREAS. LET THOSE PLACES TO BUILD LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BUILDING. AND REDO THE URBAN REAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT THE NEED. SO WE WON'T HAVE THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE. SO WE WILL HAVE HOUSING FOR EVERYBODY- BUT UNTIL WITHOUT SUPPLY CATCHES OF THE DEMAND THE HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS- WHEN YOU'RE ACQUIRING COMMERCIAL LAND THAT'S THREE TIMES AS MUCH- ACQUISITION COSTS. AS IT IS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. JUST GO THROUGH GENERAL PLANT PLAN PROCESS TRY TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S. THE LAND FROM COMMERCIAL TO RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND WATCHING SCREAM. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY JUST LOST A MILLION DOLLARS ON THE PROPERTY. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT- WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER A- CONSIDER IN THESE COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT. I'D RATHER THOSE COSTS BE SPENT ON ON THE PEOPLE TO BUILD PLACES BUT WE'RE SPENDING ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. AND THEN. OUR OUR WORKERS ARE CUT SHORT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO- COMMENT ON IT. I WILL BRING IT BACK TO YOU MISS WICKS- FOR CLOSE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I WANNA- THANK THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DYESS AND GIVE YOU ALL MY COMMITMENT. AND MY COMMITMENT TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS- HOPEFULLY A SOLUTION WE CAN ALL AGREE TO- I'M COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS- I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS WHO CAME OUT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT THROUGH THE HALLWAYS AND THE FOLKS WHO CAME OUT TO SPEAK OUT IN OPPOSITION- AND I DON'T DOUBT THE SINCERITY OR THE PASSION OR THE BELIEFS BEHIND. BOTH SIDES- WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT- WE HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO TAKE ACTION IN THIS BODY AND I RESPECTFULLY MISTER CHAIR BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS BOLD AND IT DOES ADDRESS SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT FACE. US AS A STATE THAT FACE OUR HOUSING POLICY AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT- AS I SAID IN MY STATEMENT RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS AND THAT WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE WAGE THEFT. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW- PREVAILING WAGE AND HEALTH CARE AND A LOT OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I THINK OR PORTANTINO I'M SOMEONE WHO I CAME OUT OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT I WORKED IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT MOVEMENT. OF MY VALUES ARE LABOR VALUES AND THAT IS WHAT DRIVES ME IN THIS JOB EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WHEN I SEE. ENCAMPMENT AFTER ENCAMPMENT AFTER ENCAMPMENT GROWING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AT OUR FREEWAY UNDERPASSES ON OR OFF RAMPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. CANNOT SIT AROUND. AND DO NOTHING. I CANNOT SIT AROUND AND SAY NOW I HAVE TO SAY YES AND I HAVE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET TO YES AND I BELIEVE. MY COLLEAGUES ARE. ON THAT PAGE I BELIEVE TRUTHFULLY THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO GET TO YES AS WELL. AND OBVIOUSLY OUR SPONSORS SO I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE CONVERSATIONS I GIVE YOU MY WORD IN ALL HONESTY AND SINCERITY THAT. I WILL WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND SOME SENSE OF SOLUTION. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF COMMENTS TODAY. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND ALSO WHEN I ALLOW MY JOINT AUTHORS TO SAY ANY CLOSING REMARKS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS- FIRST OF ALL LET IT BE- STATED THAT ALL CREDIT- SO CREDIT GOES TO THE VERY HARD WORK OF CHAIR WICKS AS AUTHOR OF TWENTY OPEN AS WELL AS THOSE SPONSORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK TO- OUT OF ALL THE MYRIAD OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA TWO OF THEM ARE AT ISSUE ONE IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS- THAT BENEFITS FROM SUBSIDY.

SIX ZERO THAT IS OUT BUT LEAVE IT OPEN- LET'S ON TO ITEM NUMBER TW MISTER REAVIS CAN BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MANAGE AND SO THIS IS IT SIXTY FIFTY FOUR. YES SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR. ALSO TO SEE EVERYBODY THIS MORNING- AND BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND THIS LEGISLATION IS ON THE BILL A ONE SIX FIVE FOUR- SEEKS TO HELP ELIMINATE OUR STATEWIDE SHORTAGE OF PHARMACARE HOUSING IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS THE FIRST IS LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO CONDUCT A FIRST OF ITS KIND STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT OF FORMER HOUSING NEEDS AND CONDITIONS AND THEN DEVELOP A FORMAL HOUSING STRATEGY. ON THOSE FINDINGS UNFORTUNATELY- AS A STATE WE CLEARLY LACK- YOU KNOW THE KIND OF STATEWIDE DATA NEEDED TO TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. YEAH I SHOULD NOTE A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FARMWORKER HOUSING STUDY IN ACTION PLAN- THAT WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE SALINAS APOLLO VALLEYS- WAS PUT AND WAS PREPARED BY THE CALIFORNIA'S TWO FOR REAL STUDIES IT ILLUSTRATED A DIRE DIRE HOUSING SITUATION HIGH RATES OF OVERCROWDING AND HOMELESSNESS AMONGST OUR OUR OF. AMONG FARMWORKERS THEIR FAMILIES PROVIDE A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR FORMER HOUSING YOU KNOW BY SAID INSIDE AT LEAST 5% OF ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDITS. FOR A FORMER HOUSING FOR TEN YEARS. BOTH OF THESE MEASURES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN THIS BILL- AND THEY WILL PUT OUR STATE ON A PATH TO DO MUCH MUCH MORE. THAN WE HAVE AS A STATE TO ADDRESS OUR FORMER HOUSING SHORTAGE- ANY SURE DECENT DECENT LIVING CONDITIONS FOR THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS BRIAN AUGUSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RULE ASSISTANCE- FOUNDATION. ACTUALLY OF THE CHAIR FOR HER- PARKER MISTER EVANS GO FIRST AND THEN ALL NO PROBLEM THESE CERTAINLY. THE MORNING MY NAME IS PARKER I'M A PROUD MANAGER WITH- MUTUAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA WE'RE A NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE BILLS BECAUSE MUTUAL HOUSING IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW DEVELOPERS IN THE STATE THAT CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY USED THE STATE FARM WORKER TAX CREDIT IN ITS CURRENT FORM- SURE YOU GUYS HAVE ALL HEARD PLENTY OF HORROR STORIES ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA BOTH HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM THE DEVELOPERS IN YOUR DISTRICT- BUT THIS PROJECT WAS WAS REALLY A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. LET'S START WITH A CALL ABOUT A SITE IN THE CITY OF WOODLAND AND YOLO COUNTY- SMALL COMMUNITY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES NORTHWEST OF HERE ABOUT THIS SITE WE- SCOPE IT OUT TALK TO SOME ELECTED OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS AND TURNED OUT THEY WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE SITE SO HEY WE'RE OFF TO A REALLY GREAT START. TO LAUGH. IT DEPENDS START OFF MAKE IT BETTER START THAN SOME ONE WAY TO IS ONE WAY TO MOVE OF THE DOOR CLOSES. I'LL TWO GRADES ON ON THIS SITE SO WE TALK TO SOME MORE LIKE THAT OFFICIALS MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS HEY WHAT KIND OF- POPULATIONS ARE YOU LOOKING TO SEARCH AND WE LEARNED THAT THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR FARMWORKER HOUSING IN THE CITY OF WOODLAND. FANTASTIC LET'S BUILD A FARMER HOUSING. AND WE ALWAYS START WITH THE LOCAL RESOURCES FIRST BECAUSE THOSE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST ONES THAT NEED TO BE COMMITTED. AND IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE RUN INTO THE PROJECT THE PROBLEM THAT IS INHERENT BUILDING FARM WORKER HOUSING WHICH IS YOU'RE DEALING WITH SMALL JURISDICTIONS. SMALL CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US EVEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO MUCH LESS WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE BAY AND IN LOS ANGELES. NO THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE CITY WOULD ONE DIDN'T HAVE ANY RESOURCES THEY DID. THEY HAD AND HOME ALLOCATION THEY HAD THEIR CDBG ALLOCATION. EVEN HAD THE FOR A HOUSING TRUST FUND WHICH NOT ALL CITIES OF THEIR SIZE DO. AND THEY- BASICALLY GAVE EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD TO THIS PROJECT. BUT STILL NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TO FILL THE GAP THAT THAT THAT IT TAKES TO BUILD THIS FARMER HOUSING PROJECT. SO WE TURN TO- YOU STA. WHO SUPPORTS A LOT FROM ACCOUNTING PROJECTS I KNOW THERE ARE SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE WHO ARE. INTERESTED IN STREAMLINING PROCESSES IT T. CACH INSIDE LIKE A CD AND I WOULD LOVE IF YOU GUYS COULD GET YOUR HANDS ON USDA. BUT WE- WE ENDED UP GETTING AN ALLOCATION FROM THEM. CLOSER STILL NOT QUITE ENOUGH WHICH IS WHAT LED US TO. GET REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE FARM WORKER TAX CREDIT. NOW THE STATE FARM OF TAX CREDIT IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS A GRAND TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S NOT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE STATE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION THE BROADER ONE PERFORMERS IT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WHICH IS ENOUGH TO GET YOU MAYBE HALF A UNIT IN THE BAY AREA EACH YEAR. IT'S NOT VERY. MUCH- IN. IT'S SO SOME THAT YOU CAN DOESN'T EVEN IT OUT OF YEAR THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR TO POOL UP. AFTER LIKE FIVE YEARS FOR IT TO GET TO A POINT WHERE IT'S EVEN USABLE FOR A PROJECT- SO FOR THIS PROJECT WE WERE. FORTUNATE IN OUR TIMING AND WE WERE COMPETITIVE ON OUR APPLICATION AND WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN AWARD OF FIVE YEARS WORTH OF THIS STATE FARM WORKER CREDIT. TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT HELPED CLOSE THE GAP AND FUND THIS PROJECT. GET A BILL YOU COULD NOT WRAP UP COMMENTS PLEASE. YES THIS FIVE HUNDRED THIS THIS UP THIS THIS MOVEMENT OF. TO GET TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THE FORMER HOUSING TAX CREDIT WOULD BE. ABSOLUTELY TREMENDOUS. IT WILL ENABLE US TO BUILD MORE TREMENDOUS PROJECTS LIKE SPRING LAKE- AND- I WOULD. REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DISTRIBUTIVE BRINING US ON BEHALF OF THEIR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THAT. CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RAW HOUSING SPONSORS OF THE BILL FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT THE AUTHORED. MR HAVE JUST LAID OUT. YOU KNOW. WE'RE GOING TO STUDY THE- PROBLEM WE KNOW THERE IS A SHORTAGE FOR FARMWORKERS BUT WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME MORE DETAILS ON THAT SO WE CAN CRAFT SOME SOLUTIONS. AND IN THE MEANTIME. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT MISTER EVANS WAS JUST DESCRIBING. WE NEED MORE RESOURCES THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT. WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

LET'S GO AHEAD OF THE PHONE LINES ANYONE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR MOTIONS. I AM A MOTION. WAS AMERICA APRIL SECONDED BY SOME AWARD ANY OTHER COMMENTS. LET THEM MOVE. SECOND OKAY. QUESTIONS OKAY CENTER AWARD THANK YOU MR- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I REMEMBER- I DON'T TOUR THAT I'M HE HOSTED AND US THINK THIS LENIS AREA WE HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY DIVE INTO FARM WORKER HOUSING AND I KNOW WHAT A NECESSARY COMPONENT IS FOR OUR TOTAL HOUSING NEEDS AND PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE- WHO- WHO ARE FARMWORKERS AND DESPERATELY NEED THIS IS A RESOURCE AS WELL- I AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB I HAVE VERY STRONG RESERVATIONS ABOUT CARVE OUTS ESPECIALLY ON EXISTING FUNDING STREAMS ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS- THE PIE IS LIMITED THAT IT IS RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO BE EFFICIENT- WITHOUT THAT PINE. I THINK AS A PIE GROWS WE CAN SEE YOU KNOW MORE OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE TO BE ABLE TO HELP AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT OR FUNDING SOCIAL PROGRAMS OR WHATEVER IT IS- IN A. MORE- CONCERTED WAY BUT- THAT SAID I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE AND I WANT I WANT I WANT TO BE IS AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE TO THE NEED FOR FARMWORKER HOUSING. DOESN'T GET DIGGING INTO THIS IS THOUGH I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. ONE IS- YOU KNOW ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE COLLEGES THAT- THE- SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS- SPECIFICALLY UNDER. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR- NOTED THAT. TEN PERCENT- OF THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING IN RURAL AREAS SO THIS IS ALREADY. EXISTING LAW. HOW IS. THIS BILL REQUIRING A 5% SET ASIDE REALLY ADDING VALUE. SO AS YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IN MISTER EVANS I THINK YOU KNOW IF. IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM PROGRESS CERTAINLY- I THINK ONE CRITICAL ASPECT IS THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE FARM FOR BILL THERE'S A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS. 34% BASIS BOOSTS WHAT'S ADDITIONAL EQUITY- THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE LARGER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION STATE TAX CREDIT. THE THAT AREN'T LOCATED IN. A DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP AREA QUALIFIED CENSUS TRACT- IT PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO THESE PROJECTS THAT'S NOT. PART OF THE SET ASIDE FOR THE- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OKAY. OKAY MAYBE I JUST ONE MORE THING THAT MISTER WARD IS I THINK THE 10% REFERENCE IN THAT HOUSES WHICH WAS EXCELLENT. WAS TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE HOW. THE AUTHOR MAY HAVE COME 25% FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. DIFFERENT AS YOU KNOW SILENCE. FUNDING STREAMS SOME OF WHICH CREATED A SET ASIDE THERE COULD BE AS HIGH AS 10% IN RURAL AREAS OKAY AND ON THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WITH LIGHT TECH- THE HISTORICAL SORT OF SUCCESS OF THIS- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLY TWO. HOUSING PROJECTS RECEIVED BY TECH AWARDS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE RECEIVED IT BUT THE RETURN THE CREDITS- RETURNING- YOU KNOW THE SET AND THEN YOU KNOW THE CURRENT SET ASIDE IS THERE AT. AT FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS- MEANWHILE THIS BILL WOULD- SUBJUGATE I GUESS FUTURE ALLOCATIONS OR FEATURE SET ASIDES FOR THREE YEARS AND FINE YEARS BUT WE HAVE SUCH A BROADER NEED RIGHT NOW. IN THE PROJECTS ARE SHOVEL READY AND READY TO GO AS MUCH AS I WANT THAT TO BE PRIORITIZED. I ALSO DON'T WANT TO HOLD IT FUNDING BECAUSE AND IMPLEMENTED LAW WAS SETTING ASIDE SOMETHING ELSE THAT IT WAS READY TO GO. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO RECONCILE THIS. REMEMBER THE A QUESTION- SO IF YOU TO ONE OUR PRE THAT I THINK. THE PARTICULAR PROJECT WE HAVE A VERY SMALL POOL TO COMPARE THIS TO BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT IS ONE OF ONLY THREE THAT HAVE. RECEIVED FUNDING IN RECENT. TIMES AND MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO TEACH AXAPTA ABOUT THIS. RAN INTO SOME PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND RELATED TO. THE VALUE OF THE CREDITS OR ANYTHING THERE SO- AND YES IMPORTER THOSE THOSE MONIES CAME BACK AND WE HAD TO BE REPROGRAMMED. BUT IN ALL BUT- THAT'S NOT A TYPICAL I THINK WHAT WERE- ONE PIECE OUR CONTACTS AND I UNDERSTAND. AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT FOR STYLING MONEY AND LEAVING IT THERE WHEN IT. IS ELSEWHERE. OR WHAT WE'RE DOING IN PART IN THIS BILL IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME BEEN A FARMWORKER CREDIT WHICH- IS. A VERY VALUABLE FOR THE REASONS THAT MISTER EVANS TALKED ABOUT AND. AS WE'VE EXPANDED THE OVERALL POOL. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS HAVE NOT. CORRESPONDINGLY THAT FARMER GRAD SO. WE'RE WE'RE LESS CREATING SOMETHING NEW AS IMPLEMENTING THAT POLICY MORE FULLY AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN THAT FOR. DEVELOPERS AND MISTER EVANS COULD ADDRESSES WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PROJECT AND YOU SEE THAT THE CREDITS ARE ONLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE MAYBE EVERY THREE YEARS WHEN THEY GET UP TO THAT AMOUNT. YOU SORT OF START PICKING DIFFERENT PROJECTS BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO PUT THIS MONEY ASIDE HAVE IT BE ROBUST ENOUGH UP TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE UPTAKE AND WE'RE GONNA GET BETTER PROJECTS COMING THROUGH THE DOOR SO THAT THINK THAT IS. PART OF WHY WE THINK THIS IS VERY VALUABLE OKAY- THANK YOU I TRUST THAT THAT THAT BACKGROUND AND EXPERTISE AS WELL BECAUSE I WANT THIS PROJECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE DESPERATELY NEED THEM- HAPPY TO GIVE IT A COURTESY VOTE TODAY AS WELL- THE THING ONE. I THAT I LIKE HERE A LOT IS THE REQUIREMENT FREE CD TO WORK BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX ON A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE FARM WORKER HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT WE HAVE AS WELL. I'M GLAD THAT'S IN HERE AND I HOPE IS THIS MOVES FORWARD I'LL BE WATCHING IT WILL BE TALKING TO OTHER. AFFORDABLE HOUSING- INTERESTS AS WELL BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T. WE HAVEN'T FUNDED LIKE TECH ENOUGH MAYBE HAS MORE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO ALSO INCREASE THE PINEY AND THEN THAT ALLOWS AT THE FOR- ANY. ABILITY FOR A SET ASIDE TO MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE AND TEST THIS OUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THE THREE YEAR HOLD- WITHHOLDING- TO BE ABLE TO RETURN IT. OR ANY UNUSED FUNDS AS WELL. I'LL BE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS MYSTERY THIS THANK YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AS WELL BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. THEY'RE VERY REAL AND I THINK IS BRIAN HAD MENTIONED THE FIVE PERCENT- IS INTENDED TO BE A FLOOR RIGHT- BUT THEN ALSO. TO YOUR POINT MAINTAINING FLEXIBILITY I WANNA SAY THE LEGISLATION EXPRESSLY ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE- TO AMEND ANY AMOUNT AFTER THIS THE- IS DONE. SO THANK YOU SHORT. AND I WAS JUST RESPECT ASK NOT ABOUT TURNOUT QUESTIONS GREAT AND I THAT WILL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOSING- I'M SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WANT TO SEE IT GET THROUGH COMMITTEE TODAY WE OBVIOUSLY NEED MORE- FARMWORKER HOUSING I KNOW MYSTERY THIS YOU'VE BEEN SUCH A LEADER IN THE SPACE REALLY APPRECIATE RAFIC SENIOR VOICE- WITH THAT WE CAN TAKE ROLE. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS- WICKS FIVE. I SEYARTO CARILLO. GABRIEL GABRIEL I KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY QUIRK-SILVA QUIRK-SILVA I WARD WAR DIE. FOR THE BILL IS OUT WILL LEAVE IT OPEN THOUGH FURTHER SAT ON AND WE CAN GO INTO YOUR SECOND BILL AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THIRTY FOUR I SHOULD NOTE ALSO MANAGER THAT I WILL BE PRESENTING- SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE FOR MR SANTIAGO- GREAT OKAY. TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AGAIN IT'S LIKE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL ENOUGH THAT I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS IN THIS BILL SENATE BILL TWO TWO THREE FOUR A SEEKS TO CREATE STANDARDS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPROVE POST ENTITLEMENT RESIDENTIAL BUILDING PERMITS. NOW THESE POST ENTITLEMENT BUILDING PERMITS INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT IS NECESSARY PRIOR TO AND DURING. THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PROCESS THIS INCLUDES GRADING- SOME DEMOLITION SPRINKLERS THREE CLOSURES ADDRESS AT. TO BE CLEAR THIS LEGISLATION ONLY AFFECTS PERMITS THAT ARE ISSUED AFTER AFTER A PROJECT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND AFTER ANY SEQUEL REVIEW. YOU UNLIKE THE PERMITTING THE PERMITS TO MINE ACT AS WAS NOTED THE BILL ANALYSIS WHICH REQUIRES PUBLIC AGENCIES TO ACT FAIRLY AND PROMPTLY ON APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT OPPOSE WILLS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR THE APPROVAL OF HOMEBUILDING PERMITS AS A RESULT THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RECEIVE APPROVE AND EXECUTE HOMEBUILDING PERMITS IN A TIMELY MATTER. VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND IN SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY PROJECT BEEN MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS WAITING FOR THE APPROVAL AND EXECUTION OF THESE BUILDING PERMITS- AND THIS IS AFTER THE PROJECT ITSELF HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND APPROVED. THESE ADMINISTRATOR PERMITTING DELAYS INCREASED PROJECT COSTS AFFECT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. THEY SLOW OVERALL CRITICAL HOUSING PRODUCTION PARTICULARLY- AMID ARE WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS. YOU KNOW AGAIN ADMINISTRATIVE- THESE ADMINISTRATIVE- SOME PERMITTING DELAYS EXIST BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CLEAR GUIDELINES OR STANDARDS PROCESS AND SO THIS LEGISLATION WOULD CREATE A PREDICTABLE AND EFFICIENT PROCESS. FOR THE APPROVAL AND EXECUTION OPPOSE ENTITLEMENT PHASE HOMEBUILDING PERMITS IN THREE WAYS FIRST INFORMATION POSTING SECOND- ESTABLISHING A DEEMED COMPLETE TIME FRAME AND THIRD. BY- A STAFF ASSIST OF REVIEW TIME FRAME. YOU KNOW ALL THESE PROVISIONS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE DELAY WHEN PROCESSING THESE PERSON TELL ME HOMEBUILDING PERMITS- WITH US HERE. THIS MORNING TO TESTIFY R. CORY SMITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE HOUSING ACION COALITION. AS WELL AS K. CONLEY ARCHITECT AND PRINCIPAL- AT ARCHITECTS FOR A WHO CAN ADDRESS A TACKLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL THEY SHOULD. SO GOOD MORNING I CHAIR MEMBERS CORY SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING ACTION COALITION. WE ARE A MEMBER SUPPORTED NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR BUILDING MORE HOMES FOR RESIDENTS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO THREE FOUR. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED A NUMBER OF BILLS RELATED TO THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS WITH THE HOPES THAT IT WOULDN'T INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND AFFORDABILITY ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER I MEMBERS AND MANY OTHER HOME BUILDERS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE POST ENTITLEMENT BUILDING PERMIT ACQUISITION PROCESS. AB TWO TO THREE FOUR WOULD CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PROCESS RESIDENTIAL BUILDING PERMITS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY. IN REALITY THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS PERMITS TO NOT GET REVIEWED IN A TIMELY MANNER. FOR EXAMPLE MANY PROJECT APPLICATIONS DO NOT SUPPORT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION THE CITY NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH A REVIEW. AND BY REQUIRING A SIMPLE CHECK. CHECKS WILL NOTE WHAT IS TO BE DONE. SOMETIMES IT IS A STAFFING CAPACITY ISSUE AND BY REQUIRING MODEL PERMITS HIGHER QUALITY APPLICATIONS WILL GET SUBMITTED. BECAUSE THE PROJECT UNDERSTANDS HOW A CITY WANTS TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION. SOMETIMES AND THIS IS WHERE. IT IS ACTUALLY A CITY ACTING IN BAD FAITH IN TRYING TO SLOW DOWN THE PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING. REGARDLESS OF THE REASON THE PERMITTING PROCESS CAN UNNECESSARILY TAKE UP TO THREE YEARS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. AND CAN BE MONTHS BEFORE AN APPLICATION IS EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY LOCAL JURISDICTION. BY REQUIRING REASONABLE TIMELINES TO REVIEW PROJECTS ARE NOT GOING TO WAIT ENDLESSLY TO GET THEIR PERMITS APPROVED. THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY IMPACTFUL 41100% SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. FINANCING 1100% SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND DUE TO THE COMPLEX TAX SYSTEM MANY PROJECTS FACE A VERY TIGHT TIME FRAME TO ACQUIRE PERMITS IN ORDER TO SECURE.

I'LL BE SURE THAN FOUR MINUTES GOOD MORNING SURE WICKS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES TODAY REGRETTABLY WITHIN OPPOSITION POSITION REALLY TO CORE ISSUES WITH THIS BILL THERE'S THE PROCESS AND THEN THERE'S THE TECHNOLOGY PROVISION SO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS. WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE THE BILL HAS MOVED A LOT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO THE SPONSORS I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT SOMETIMES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE APPLICATION IS THIS IS ABOUT RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT'S NOT ABOUT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACTING IN BAD FAITH AND SO WITH THAT SORT OF RECOGNITION I THINK THAT HELPS US HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION. ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS FOR REVIEWING THESE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES FOR US IS REALLY THE EXPANSIVE NATURE OF WHAT THE SUPPLIES TO YOU THIS ISN'T JUST KIND OF THE THINGS GOING TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IT'S THE OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS IT'S OUR PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT IT COULD BE YOUR FIRE DISTRICT UTILITY. PROVIDER THAT- IS OWNED BY THE COUNTY OR THE CITY AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE REALLY CLEAR SORT OF BRIGHT LINES ABOUT WHAT IS INCLUDED I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION IN THE CURRENT TEXT OF THE BILL AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR LETTER WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S OUT BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OFF RAMP THAT WAS ADDED FOR PARTICULARLY COMPLEX APPLICATIONS THAT REALLY JUST CAN'T BE REVIEWED IN THE TIME FRAMES IN THE BILL. BUT WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON TAT PIECE ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS- WE'VE CONSISTENTLY TOLD THE AUTHOR THAT WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FOCUS ON EITHER THE PROCESS OR THE TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT BOTH WITHIN ONE BILL THERE ARE REAL COST AND AS THE ANALYSIS NOW NOTES THOSE WON'T BE PAID BY THE STATE RIGHT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE PASSED ON TO APPLICANTS AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT OST. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT HOUSING DATA STRATEGY REPORT FROM EACH CD YOUR OWN ADMINISTRATION IS TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS A VERY COSTLY UNDERTAKING TO MOVE TO AN AUTOMATED ONLINE. ELECTRONIC PERMITTING SYSTEM IS DOLLARS OF AVERAGE. WHERE DO IT AND IT'S NOT JUST THE COST OF. IT UP IT'S THE- OF MAINTAINING IT LONG TERM SO WE THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WE THINK WE SHOULD REALLY HAVE STATE RESOURCES ON THE TABLE FOR THAT. GIVEN THE FISCAL SITUATION THE STATE IS AS COMPARED TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO. CONTINUE TO HOPE THAT THAT PEACE CAN COME OUT OF THE BILL AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT IMPROVING THE PROCESS. IN A REASONABLE WAY BUT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST TODAY AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES THIRTY HOUSING CALIFORNIA IN MANY ON HOUSE PERSONS THIS BILL AIMS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO EXITING HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES BY INCREASING OPTIONS FOR TICKET FORGIVENESS. IN L. A. COUNTY ALONE OF THE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN VEHICLES FOR MANY THIS VEHICLE IS THE LAST VESTIGE OF STABILITY AND THE ONLY THING KEEPING THEM FROM BEING DIRECTLY ON THE SIDEWALK THEIR ONLY PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS. AND IS THE ONLY PLACE THEY HAVE TO SAFELY STORE THEIR BELONGINGS VEHICLES ALSO A LIFELINE TO EXIT HOMELESSNESS THE ABILITY OF THE VEHICLE CAN HELP YOU GET A JOB ACCESS HEALTH CARE ME WITH THE CASE MANAGER. GOT A JOB. INTERVIEWS AND APPLY FOR MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS IN MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THAT VEHICLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR PARKING TICKETS THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN SOME CASES PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE SCRAPING MONEY TOGETHER THE THEY COULD BE USING TO GET HOUSE TO PAY THESE TICKETS OFF OR TURNING TO ILLICIT ACTIVITIES TO HELP THEM PAY THOSE TICKETS. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WE ARE PAYING FOR PROGRAMS TO RE HOUSE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WITH ONE HAND AND THEN. THEM FOR BEING. THE OTHER HAND THIS BILL LOOKS TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMS IN CITIES WERE TICKET FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY WORKING TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WOULD ASK ALL OF OUR CITIES TO CREATE TICKET FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE GIVING PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES A PATHWAY TO STABILITY. INSTEAD OF PUSHING PEOPLE DEEPER INTO CRISIS AND MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO BECOME HOUSE. BUT ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT THIS PROGRAM- IS NOT THE SAME AS LOST REVENUE THE VAST MAJORITY OF ON HOUSE PEOPLE FACING THESE FINES DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THEM. THERE'S NO RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM MUNICIPALITIES EVEN IF THEY SEIZE AND SELL THE CARS IN FACT IT COST THE GOVERNMENT. MORE TRYING TO COLLECT THESE FINES AND FEES THAN THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVE. THIS IS HARM REDUCTION COMPASSIONATE. IT'S GOOD GOVERNANCE A. B. SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE ALSO HAS A LIMIT IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FINES. ADDITIONALLY A. B. SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE RELIES ON VERIFIED ENROLLMENT IN EXISTING HOME SERVICE PROGRAMS. MEANING THAT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONTACT WITH THE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDER.

OF THE PROTEST PROPOSED IN THE BILL IS PROBLEMATIC THE MAIN PROBLEM BEING WITH THE PARKING TICKET ISSUED AT THE AUTHOR STATED THE AGENCY WOULD NEED TO DEDICATE TIME RESOURCES AND MANPOWER TO THE TASK LIKE THAT YOU CAN FIND TO DO ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE END INDIVIDUALS QUALIFIED UNDER SIXTY FIVE FOR FINANCIAL EVERY. MORE STREAMLINED AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH WOULD BE TO REQUIRE STATE LEVEL PRE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT PER PLACARD TYPE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THE TARGETED INDIVIDUALS IN THIS BILL- IN THE BILL THIS WEEK THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO ASSIST OR SIMPLY NOT TAKEN IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR CONCERNS OF MAKING AVAILABLE PARKING AND PARKING SPACE TURNOVER WOULD REMAIN- BUT IT WOULD REMOVE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THE CURRENT BILL DOES IMPOSE.

KEEPING PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS ALBEIT ARGUING THAT LIVING IN YOUR CAR IS DEFINITELY A FORM OF BEING ON HOUSING- IS OMETHING WE HAVE TO DO WE CAN'T CRIMINALIZE WILL PENALIZE OUR WAY OUT OF HOMELESSNESS OR POVERTY.

I AB TWENTY THE TWENTY NINETY SEVEN FIRST YEAH WHICHEVER YOU PREFER OKAY WE'LL START WITH TWENTY NINETY SEVEN- GOOD MORNING URN MEMBERS- THIS IS A BILL THAT PASSED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD BASICALLY ALLOW FOR DEVELOPERS TO RIGHT SIZE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR PROJECT AS LONG AS THE BILL THE PROJECT IS WITHIN A HALF A MILE OF A TRAIN STOP OR OTHER HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. WE PROVIDE MORE SPACES FOR CARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DO BEDS FOR HUMAN BEINGS WHO LIVE HERE AND IT MANY TIMES ESPECIALLY IN THESE URBAN AREAS ARE CLOSE TO TRANSIT- WE HAVE OF THE PLETHORA OF PARKING SPACES- WE DO SO MUCH PARKING THAT'S UNDER USER AND USE IT ALL THAT CONTINUING TO REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO ADD A PRIEST OF SUBSCRIBED AMOUNT OF PARKING REGARDLESS OF THE NEEDS OF THEIR RESIDENTS DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE PUBLIC POLICY SENSE IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE. AND THE DEVELOPERS KNOW HOW MUCH PARKING THAT THEY NEED SAN DIEGO A FEW YEARS AGO INSTITUTED THIS POLICY IN THEIR DOWNTOWN CORE AND YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF PARKING THEY STILL BILL PARKING BUT THEY BOTH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PARKING AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO OFFER RESIDENTIAL UNITS WITH MAYBE ONE SPACE INSIDE OF TWO OR TANDEM PARKING HAS SINCE- THERE RESIDENTS INTO GIVEN THE CHOICE-OF PAYING A LITTLE BIT LESS A MONTH TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. A ARM. OF THE BILL HAS GAINED A LOT OF SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT'S SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA YIMBY SPUR ABUNDANT HOUSING LA THE COUNCIL OF INFILL BOULDER BOULDER'S. AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE LA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND TRANSFORM. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU GET ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TOGETHER. MAYBE IT'S A IT'S GOOD POLICY. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING- COLIN PARENT COUNCIL MEMBER WITH THE CITY OF LA MESA. AND MIA KANG SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE RELATE WITH RELATED CALIFORNIA AND DIRECTOR OF THE COUNCIL OF INFILL BUILDERS. I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPECTFUL YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHECK TWO MINUTES. MORNING MY NAME IS COLIN PARENT I'M ON THE CITY COUNCIL OF WILL MESA WHICH IS ABOUT TEN MILES EAST OF DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO- I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND GENERAL COUNSEL WITH THE NONPROFIT CALLED CIRCULATE SAN DIEGO- HERE TESTIFYING FOR THE BUILDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE INVITATION AND- JUST WANT TO MAKE A THREE KEY POINTS ABOUT THIS BILL. SO FIRST YOU KNOW IT'S THE CEILING SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE VERY SUBURBAN- IN A SMALL TOWN- BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A GREAT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ORDINANCE VERY PERMISSIVE- YOU'RE VERY PRO HOUSING WE'VE GOT- IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. REALLY GOOD FAITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND THERE'S NO WAY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF THESE ORDINANCES LOCALLY IF THE STATE HADN'T ACTED FIRST THE JUST THE POLITICS ARE THERE FOR IT AND I THINK FOR THOSE OF YOU WILL WHO SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT- ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF A LARGE CITY I THINK WE'LL WILL UNDERSTAND WHY AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A BIG PART OF WHY- WE REALLY WANT TO SEE SOME ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS. BECAUSE I'M CONFIDENT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE GOOD FAITH IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS LONG AS OTHER FOLKS- AS LONG AS THE LEGISLATURE RACKS IN SECOND- YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE PARKING MINIMUMS DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE DON'T BILL TWENTY PARKING SO IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN- VERY SIMILAR POLICY THAT THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORD. SUPPORT AND GET ACROSS ON PEOPLE ARE STILL BUILDING PARKING WHEN THEY WHEN THEY NEED TO BUT THEY'RE ALSO BUILDING AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT THEY THINK IS NECESSARY TO SERVE THE EVOLVING- MARKET PLACE AS OPPOSED TO ASSUMING EVERYONE NEEDS THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF PARKING IN MY CITY IN LA MESA LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING IN THERE TO START A FAMILIES BUY HOMES FOR THE FIRST TIME. A LOT OF THESE FOLKS DON'T HAVE CARS THERE AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY HAVING THEIR YOU'RE CHOOSING NOT TO HAVE CARS ARE HAVING FEWER CARS IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR OVERALL HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES- INA BILL LIKE IN THIS BILL WILL HELP- ALLOW FOR MORE THOSE PRODUCTS TO BE ON CREATED TO SERVE THAT CHANGING MARKET AND THEN FINALLY- MY ORGANIZATION CIRCULATE SAN DIEGO PUBLISHER- ABOUT A WEEK. A HALF AGO- SHOWING THAT IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- EVEN AFTER PARKING REFORM- WAS- ENACTED DENSITY BONUS PRODUCTION ACTUALLY. WENT UP ACTUALLY WENT UP A LOT. IN TWENTY TWENTY- 44% OF THE UNITS ENTITLED. IN THE CITY SAN DIEGO USE THAT- DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM. AND IT YEAH AND THE PARKING REFORM THAT HAD HAPPENED A FEW YEARS REALLY DIDN'T UNDERMINE THE PRODUCTION THAT SO WE'RE STILL SEEING GREAT USES OF THAT PROGRAM. AND PARKING REFORM- CAN ABSOLUTELY WORK WELL WITH. AND SUPPORT- AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE USE OF DENSITY BONUS. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF THE SUPPORT THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING AMIR KHAN A WITH RELATED CALIFORNIA AND OF THE COUNCIL OF INFILL BUILDERS I'VE BEEN IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER FOR THE LAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUILDING. UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES IN THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT'S COMMON IN ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENTS I'VE EVER WORKED ON IS. NEEDING TO REDUCE THE PARKING REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE DEVELOPMENT. OF PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL REQUIREMENTS DON'T REFLECT TODAY'S SOCIETY ESPECIALLY RENTERS- INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. ACCORDING TO THE LAST CENSUS. OVER 52% OF CALIFORNIA RENTERS OWN ZERO OR ONE CAR. AND SO WE'RE REALLY BUILDING WERE THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE SORT OF SET IN PLACE OF BACK WHEN FRANKLY EVERYONE OWNED MULTIPLE CARS. AND YET WE'RE SEEING THIS ABSOLUTE CHANGE AND PART OF IT IS THE COST OF HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE PEOPLE ARE FORGOING THE COST OF CARS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE'VE WALKABLE COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TRANSIT AND WE HAVE THINGS LIKE RIDE CHER- ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF US STUDIES I'VE BEEN READING RECENTLY. MILLENNIALS ARE ACTUALLY VALUE ACCESS TO A CAR RATHER THAN OWNING THEIR OWN VEHICLE. SO YET WE STILL HAVE THESE FRANKLY IN SOME CASES-ARCANE PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN ONE CASE I'VE HAD TO REDUCE PARKING. FOR PARKING SPACES PER UNIT DOWN TO ONE OR LESS. AND SO THE BILL LIKE THIS IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD IN MY OPINION COMMONSENSE WAY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND COULD PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT MARKET. IT'S ALSO IT IN WHILE FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS A MIXED USE BUILDINGS TO ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF A PARKING THAT IS RIGHT SIZED FOR THEIR SITES. AND FOR THEIR BUILDINGS I THINK IT WILL UNLEASH A LOT OF NEW DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES. IN THE STATE NEEDS LOVI EMPTY AREAS AND AREAS AROUND TRANSIT. AND IT WILL ABSOLUTELY REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING FOR THE END USER. AND AS WE ALL KNOW I THINK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU READ A- AN APARTMENT THAT HAS A PARKING SPACE IT COSTS MORE. MEANING APARTMENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PARKING SPACE. AND SO IT WILL TRANSLATE INTO MORE HOUSING FOR THE ELIQUIS AND MORE. PRODUCTION IN MY AND I STRONGLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE IS AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

TAKE A SEAT UP HERE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES I WAS REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE SOMEONE TRYING TO DO HERE THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE APPROACH AND WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY- ISSUES WITH THE BILL ONE- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THERE THE COST SAVINGS ACTUALLY PASSED ON TO THE RENTER OR HOMEOWNER I'M RELYING ON FOR PROFIT BUSINESS TO FOREGO PROFIT IN ORDER TO LOWER THE COST OF THE PRODUCT I'M WORDS CAPITAL THAT APPROACH- NUMBER TWO- YOU KNOW. THE ALLOWING A TRANSIT AGENCY OR A DEVELOPER TO DETERMINE- PARKING REQUIREMENT SEEMS A BIT. ODD WHEN WE HAVE LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THAT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE VOTERS WHO WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY IN CHARGE. OF THIS PARKING STANDARDS IF THERE NEEDS TO BE REFORMED. I WITH OUR CITIES GO ABOUT- INCEPTION IS WORKING REQUIREMENTS WERE CERTAINLY OPEN TO IT BUT JUST ALLOWING THOSE FOLKS TO DO IT UNILATERALLY- WE CERTAINLY OBJECT TO IT- AND THEN FINALLY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE MEASURES IMPACT AND DENSITY BONUS LAW ON THAT STATE LAWS VERY EFFECTIVE IN GETTING YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT- BECAUSE CITIES HAVE TO GIVE UP CERTAIN- YOU KNOW. CONCESSIONS AND WAIVERS I'M TO DEVELOPERS IN ORDER TO GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S THE KEYMANDATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE- FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO ADD ON HERE IN OPPOSITION NAME ORGANIZATION PLEASE. SYMPATHY ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHILE WE ARE PREACHING OF THE GOLD ON TEN OF THE BILL WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE LANGUAGE IN PRINT BUT ARE WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE OFFICE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION.

HI THIS IS A IDEA ABOUT THIS THING WITH LITTLE BOOK CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANKS. LINE. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN. WHY ONE EIGHTY SEVEN NO ONE IS NOW OPEN. HI I'M SO HIGH I'M CALLING AND I'M SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF REDWOOD CITY I WAS TRYING TO GET INTO EARLIER AND IT WOULDN'T WITH NAMES I APOLOGIZE. AND ONCE AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ONE ZERO. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THEY WISH TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BRING IT BACK HERE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER WARD. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AS WE STATED LAST YEAR ON BOTH IN COMMITTEE ON IN THE FALL ON THE FLOOR I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP TAKE THE STATE WHY WE HAVE. BEEN ONE OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THIS CHARGE- IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS RIGHT THERE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE. LOWER RENT HOUSING AND LOWER UP FOR SALE PRODUCT AS WELL BY REDUCING THIS COUPLED COSTS- AND REALLY ALLOWING THE MARKET TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE- AND I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE- FROM THE SAN DIEGO AS WELL FOR HIS ADVOCACY ON A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS. I WONDER IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT AS WELL IF YOU SAW ANY YOU'VE ALSO BEEN- AN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND DENSITY BONUS LAW- AND ANY- CHALLENGE THEIR- ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION. YES YEAH THANKS FOR ASKING SO THERE WAS A CONCERN YOU KNOW REYES- THE LAST TIME THIS WAS A BROUGHT UP ABOUT- UNDERMINING DENSITY BONUS LAW BECAUSE ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF DENSITY BONUSES YOU CAN GET OUT OF SOME PARKING RESTRICTIONS. AND I WAS ACTUALLY WHAT I WAS REFERENCING EARLIER REPORT THAT CIRCULATE PUT OUT- LAST WEEK SHOWED THAT AFTER SAN DIEGO ADOPTED THEIR PARKING REFORM IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE- DENSITY BONUS ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET UNDER MY ACTUALLY ACTUALLY GREW A LOT. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY- IT IT GREW SO MUCH THAT WAS 44% OF THE UNITS PRODUCED IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO USE DENSITY BONUS EVEN AFTER THIS REFORM SO THESE THINGS WHICH IS ASTONISHING IT'S GREAT I MEAN PART BROUGH FOR DENSITY BONUS BUT ALSO- THE PARKING REFORM- DIDN'T DIDN'T IMPACT THAT OFF- SO. I THINK WE'LL HOPEFULLY THAT CAN GIVE SOME COMFORT TO THE TO THE FOLKS WHO EXPRESSED THE CONCERN THAT THE OTHER SEPARATIST THANK YOU WILL CONTINUE RUNS HERE ARE PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AT THE AUTHOR WOULD ACCEPT IT. AND HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL TODAY. THE YOU THINK WITH THE MOST. SECONDS FOR. OF ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER SARATOGA. AGAIN THE SAME SAME ISSUES I HAVE. WITH ALL THIS WHEN YOU. ARE WORKING ARE WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN SAN DIEGO- THESE. THESE SOLUTIONS WERE GREAT THERE. THEY WERE GREAT IN LA THEY WERE GOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LIVING PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK- YOU GO TO A DISTRICT LIKE MINE. FIVE MILES TO WORK. AND WHEN YOU DRIVE AROUND- IN BELIEVE ME IF WE SAID TO DEVELOPMENT HEY. YOU GUYS DECIDE HOW MUCH PARKING YOU NEED. ADOBE IS MINIMIZED AS POSSIBLE. AND- AND THEN THE PROBLEM IS. THE VEHICLES ARE MINIMIZED AND THEN SO WE HAVE PARKING SPILLING OUT INTO OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS- WALL TO WALL CARS ON THE STREETS AND IN THOSE CREATE OTHER HAZARDS THEY CREATE HAZARDS FOR. PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND TRYING TO CROSS AS THEY GET AND SO WE HOW WE WIND UP WITH SAFETY HAZARDS OUT THERE FOR THAT SO AGAIN THIS WORKS IN THOSE AREAS THAT WE WOULD TAYLOR SOME OF THESE SOLUTIONS TO URBAN AREAS- AND ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY FOR OTHER AREAS TO DECIDE WHAT IS WORKING FOR THEM I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY OF LA MESA MY COUSINS LIVE THERE- AND IT ISN'T- THERE ARE AREAS THERE WHERE IT. WOULDN'T WORK AND YOU WIND UP HAVING IMPACTS TO EVERY BODY- INCLUDING- YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE'S. HOUSING VALUES WHAT IF YOU LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A AREA WHERE IT'S JUST HEAVILY IMPACTED BY PARKING ALL OVER THE LOOK AT LOYOLA MARYMOUNT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THAT IT AFFECTS OUR HOUSING VALUES. AND SO PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PEOPLE MY DISTRICT ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE LEFT UP TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO DO WHAT WORKS FORM BECAUSE BELIEVE ME IF WE HAVE ALL PARKING LOT THE- THOSEINTO SOMETHING A TAXES. THEN IT IS A PARKING LOT SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO- NET. BUILD MORE PARKING THAN THEY NEED. BUT LIKE I SAID SAN DIEGO WORKS. OUT IN OUR AREA DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE OF THAT IF IT WERE NARROWLY TAILORED TO URBAN AREAS I'D BE ALL OVER IT THANKS. MR GABRIEL THANK YOU MATTER CHECK A SIMILAR RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE- YOU KNOW PARKING IS AN AMENITY THAT CONSUMERS WANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL LOOK AT WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHERE TO BUY WORD AROUND WHERE THEY WANT TO LAUGH AND SO I GUESS I JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH. IN THE PRIVATE MARKET TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SUPPLY DEMAND OF PARKING AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS STOPPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM REGULATING THOSE PRIVATE ENTITIES TO COME TO THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- AND APPRECIATE THE OTHER BRING AFFORD. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINETY SEVEN OR QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. OKAY WITH THAT YOU CAN CLOSE THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WITH LIMITED RESOURCES PARTICULARLY TO BUILD HOUSING THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE OF WHAT WE'RE PRIORITIZING. AND THERE ARE SO MANY BENEFITS TO ALLOWING THESE AREAS THAT BY THE WAY ARE NOT ALL OVER CITIES THERE RIGHT NEXT TO HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. TO BECOME A MORE WALKABLE AREAS AND TO OFFER A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRODUCT AND- AS WE SAW. WE HAVE ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PRICE OF HOUSING DOES GO DOWN AND THEY DO OFFER THOSE UNITS WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO. WANT TO USE THAT TRANSIT. AS THEIR PRIMARY MEANS OF GETTING AROUND. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT CITIES HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO ALSO HELP MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS. MY CITY BILL TO MUNICIPAL PARKING LOTS IN THEIR DOWNTOWN WHICH TOOK THE BURDEN OFF OF ALL THE MOM AND POP SHOPS TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN PARKING. AND IT BECAME A REVENUE GENERATOR FOR THE CITY AS WELL WE ALSO CAN RUN BUS. THAT HELP WITH THESE AND WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE CITIES TO DO IS TO. TO THINK OF THESE OTHER SOLUTIONS. THOUGH IT DOES BUILD SUSTAINABILITY. AS WELL AS BUILD THE ALLOWANCE TO BUILD HOUSING. AND SO MANY OF OUR CODES ARE STUCK IN THE PAST AND TAKE WAY TOO LONG TO CHANGE. AND THIS IS A PLACE GIVEN THE- THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. BOTH THE FOR CLIMATE. AND FOR HOUSING WITH THE CITY WITH THE STATE DOES HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN TAKING A LEAD. SO I DO APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUES TODAY WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND AS SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM LOCAL pHAVE THE TOOLS ALSO TO. MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MISS FRIEDMAN I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR QUITE SOME TIME I AM. VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR WORK AND GLAD YOU'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I THINK IT ADDRESSES TWO OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES. INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLY AND SLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE AND I VIEW AND I KNOW YOU DO THESE ISSUES IS VERY- CONNECTED- WE MUST ACT. URGENTLY URGENTLY AND SWIFTLY AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS FOR ROLL CALL PLEASE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS WEEKS I. DON'T SEE ORIGINAL CARILLO. GABRIEL GABRIEL I. KALRA HI KALRA AYE KILEY QUIRK-SILVA. QUIRK-SILVA A WARD WHAT HI. HAS FIVE OH TO W. WOULD OPEN. I MISS FRIEDMAN YOUR UP AGAIN HERE ON AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE A BILL TO EXPAND THE PROPERTY TAX WELFARE EXEMPTION TO ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS THAT'S ALL OF THAT CELL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE. THIS IS A TAX CREDIT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SAME NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS TO REHABILITATE- TO BUILD- FOR- RENT UNITS USE THE SAME TAX CREDIT BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO USE IT WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING pPROJECT LIKE THIS AND CITY OF GLENDALE WAS I WAS ON THE COUNCIL WHICH WERE TOWN HOUSES THAT WERE SOLD TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. AND IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT- FOR DEVELOPERS TO FINANCE THIS KIND OF PRODUCT THIS WOULD HELP THEM- BECAUSE- WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT A NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS WHO BUILD A DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOME BUYERS ARE CURRENTLY DENIED A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION BECAUSE THE HOME BUYERS PAYING INTEREST ON A CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGE. INSTEAD OF ALL THE FINANCED AND GOING THROUGH A 0% INTEREST LOAN. HOW WE'VE HEARD FROM ONE AT NONPROFIT DEVELOPER WHO I BELIEVE IS HERE HERITAGE HOUSING PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE FORCED TO PAY THE PROPERTY TAX IN THE TIME THEY PURCHASED THE LAND. THROUGH CONSTRUCTION UNTIL THE CLOSE OF ESCROW WHEN THEY TURN THE KEYS OVER TO THE BUYER. THIS RESULT IN PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS OF MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER HOME THAT COULD INSTEAD BE PLACED BACK INTO DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION TO GIVE THESE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS A CHANCE TO DEVELOP STABILITY. EQUITY ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW HOMEOWNERSHIP OFFERS. AND YOU KNOW THIS ALSO IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT. OF MONEY BECAUSE WHEN THAT THE ON LIKE WITH RENTAL PROPERTY THESE HOMEOWNERS WILL EVENTUALLY PAY THEIR OWN PROPERTY TAX SO IF WE DON'T ALLOW THESE PROPERTIES TO BE BUILT IF WE USE THIS IS A BARRIER. THE CITIES IN THE STATE IS FOREVER DENIED THATTAX REVENUE. AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT- THESE ARE VERY OF A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE- PRODUCTS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO MARKET IT'S REALLY AN INSIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE BUCKET N TERMS OF TAX REVENUE. FOR THE STATE BUT IT DOES RESULT IN A LOT OF SAVINGS. AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE ASSESSOR OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY JEFF PRANG AND THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC. CONFERENCE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY ARE DAVID WILLS AT BUT NO I THINK IT'S JUST CHARLES LUCKMAN. FOR HERITAGE HOUSING PARTNERS AND HOLLY OF FERMENTED TO HIS USE FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU PERCENT AT MADAME CHARTER MORNING- DAVID WOLF WITH WELL VERSED CONSULTING REPRESENTING HERITAGE HOUSING PARTNERS WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE CHARLES LEVIN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HERITAGE HOUSING PARTNERS WHO FLEW UP FROM LOS ANGELES TODAY- JUST TO TESTIFY ON. THE BILL SOME VERY DAVID. NO I YOU MY NAME IS CHARLES WEBB AND I'M EXECUTIVE HERE HOUSING PARTNERS WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION- JUST A FEW QUICK WORDS ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION TO US HERITAGE HOUSING PARTNERS IS A NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT TWENTY THREE PLUS YEARS WE'RE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER NONPROFITS IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWO REASONS FIRST IS OUR FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP WE SURE THAT FOCUS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. AND THE OTHER REASON THAT WERE DIFFERENT IS BECAUSE OF OUR FOCUS ON MIXED INCOME HOUSING SO WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE DEVELOP OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR LOW INCOME MODERATE INCOME MIDDLE INCOME AND MARKET BUYERS ALL LIVING IN WITHIN THE SAME PROJECT- WE LIKE TO DO IT BECAUSE OF A WE FOUND THAT TO CREATE THEIR SOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR HOMEOWNERS ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IS DIVERSITY- AND THE SECOND REASON IS FRANKLY BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP- AT THE STATE THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE PROFITS FROM DEVELOPING MARKET UNITS WITHIN OUR PROJECTS AND SELF SUBSIDIZE MODERN MIDDLE INCOME UNITS. SO THAT'S WHY WE DO THAT OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE OWNERSHIP HOUSING- ATTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE TO REALLY ANY CALIFORNIANS WHO WANTS TO BE AN OWNER AND QUALIFIES TO BE AN OWNER AND WE THINK WE DO THAT WITH A COMBINATION OF TWO THINGS WHEREVER POSSIBLE BENDING THE COST CURVE ON THE COST OF PRODUCING HOUSING WHICH THIS LEGISLATION WILL DO AND SECOND PROVIDED FAVORABLE FINANCING TO OUR HOME BUYERS- WHICH IS REALLY THE BIG WAY THAT WE DO THAT HABITAT DOES THAT TO. MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN HOLLY FOR MANY ON BEHALF A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH HAVE A TOP AT THE MODEL AND HOW MUCH HAVE HIS EVENT INVOLVING THE TIMES TO GET REALLY KEEP UP WITH NOT JUST HOME PRICES WHICH ARE NOW ACCORDING TO ZILLOW FAR OF HUNDRED OUT A HOME IS THE% AVERAGE BEFORE YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHO. THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AFFORDABLE TO PEOPLE WHO UNDER PERCENT OF THE A MY- AND THERE AND A THE STATE. AND JUST LAST NIGHT WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUES AS A WRITING ME THAT JUST SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN HIS LOS ANGELES YOU CAN STILL BUY A HOME FOR UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST SEVEN YEARS AGO. AND THOSE SAME HOMES ARE NOW SELLING AT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO HABITAT INHERITED ANOTHER IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BUILD MORE HOMES. BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH A GREAT NEED THAT ARE AT THE PRICE POINT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE LOW INCOMES CAN ACTUALLY STILL AFFORD. AND I JUST RECENTLY ASKED HABITAT ARE IN OUR GREAT ALESSI UNTIL IT GREATER SAN FRANCISCO AREA IN EAST BAY SILICON VALLEY THEY WERE TELLING ME. RIGHT NOW JUST READ UNDERSTAND THE DEMAND FOR A TWENTY UNIT- PROJECT THAT WE'RE BUILDING WE HAD OVER ONE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. FOR TWENTY SIX UNITS AND AN EIGHTY UNIT A NEW ONE THAT'S ON THE HORIZON IN MARIN COUNTY ALREADY FOUR HUNDRED APPLICATIONS ARE IN THE QUEUE. AND I ASKED THEM HOW MANY OF THOSE APPLICANTS ARE QUALIFYING AN ELIGIBLE TO GET INTO THOSE HOMES AND THEY SAID IT'S A FIVE TO ONE RATIO SO EVERYONE HOME HABITAT IS BUILDING AND SERVING A FAMILY. FIVE OTHER YOU KNOW FOR OTHER FAMILIES ARE NOT GETTING INTO A HOME. ELIGIBLE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED BUT THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH HOMES ON THE MARKET. SO WE ARE HAVING TO. BUILD THE BRIDGE THIS GAP AND REDUCE THE COST OF NEW CONSTRUCTION TO GET MORE FAMILIES INTO HOMES BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WOULD BE THAT TAX CODE TO OF ALL. WITH THE MODELS THAT ARE EVOLVING OVER TIME AND WE REALLY HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT- FOR THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW BRING IT.

IS- IT'S ON CALL. IF ABSENT MEMBERS WITHOUT OF MISTER BLUE. YOU'RE BACK IN COMMITTEE. AND WE WOULD THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN I KNOW WE WANT A ROUSING CLOSING SPEECH FROM YOU HERE MR BLOOM. TURNS OUT I DID HAVE MORE BILLS I HAVE ONE MORE AT- IT'S STILL COMING UP TO. YEAH BEGIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN AND I'D LIKE TO START BY TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND ALSO REASSURE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT OF MY OFFICE WILL BE WORKING AS ALWAYS WITH THE OPPOSITION- ON- ISSUES THAT- FRANKLY SOME OF WE FOUND OUT THAT- AS RECENTLY AS FRIDAY SO WE'RE- GOING TO GET TO WORK ON THOSE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE PLANET IS GETTING WARMER AND EVERY DAY WE HEAR ABOUT NEW RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES ON SEPTEMBER SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY. THE STATE SOUGHT NEW RECORD HIGHS ACROSS MUCH OF THE STATE WOODLAND HILLS NOT TOO FAR FROM MY DISTRICT SAW A HIGH OF A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DEGREES RIVALING DEF ALLEY OAKLAND HAD A HUNDRED AND TWO SAN JOSE WAS A HUNDRED AND FIVE SANTA ANA A HUNDRED AND TEN ESCONDIDO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN AND BEVERLY HILLS WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND NOT FAR FROM THE OCEAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DEGREES. EXTREME HEAT WARNINGS ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON AS THE PLANET WARMS AND SEA LEVELS RISE AND IT IS THE POOR AND ELDERLY WHO SUFFER THE MOST. EXTREME HEAT IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THE HOTTEST DECADE ON RECORD. OFFICIAL REPORTS WERE THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DIED DUE TO HEAT EXPOSURE. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION BY THE L. A. TIMES THE ACTUAL DEATH TOLL WAS ALMOST SIX TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS REPORTED. TOTALING NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AS IT CONTINUES TO GET HOTTER. EACH YEAR EXTREME HEAT KILLS MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER CLIMATE FUELED HAZARD. LIKE OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE DISASTERS EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS THE POOR ELDERLY SICK AND VERY ON THE MOST. STATE DATA SHOWS THAT BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER RACE FROM HEAT. AND PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK. PEOPLE DIE IN HOUSES APARTMENTS AND MOBILE HOMES THAT LACK MITIGATIONS LIKE MODERN INSULATION COOL ROOF TECHNOLOGY ENERGY EFFICIENT WINDOWS AIR CONDITIONING OR EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SHADE TREES. HE DOES SOMETHING THOSE WITH RESOURCES CAN IGNORE WELL FOR THOSE WITHOUT RESOURCES IT IS A THREAT TO THEIR SURVIVAL. THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEGUN TO TAKE EXTREME HEAT SERIOUSLY AND HAS STARTED INVESTING IN PLANS AND PROGRAMS TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND TO SAVE LIVES WHAT IS MISSING IS A PLAN TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FROM EXTREME HEAT. IN THEIR OWN HOMES. CURRENTLY STATE BUILDING AND HABITABILITY STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT RENTAL HOUSING BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM INDOOR TEMPERATURE OF SEVENTY DEGREES. BUT SET NO MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE. WHEN TEMPERATURES SOAR OUTSIDE INDOOR TEMPERATURES CAN REACH EVEN HIGHER IN UNITS THAT LACK COOLEY FEATURES WHILE STILL BEING DEEMED HABITABLE UNDER THE STATE CODE. THIS MAKES LITTLE SENSE IF THE GOAL OF HABITABILITY STANDARDS IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND HEALTHY IN THEIR OWN HOMES. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN IS A MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS LIVES IN A SAFE AND RESILIENT HOME THAT PROVIDES REFUGE FROM EXTREME HEAT. IT WOULD MODERNIZE THE STATE'S HABITABILITY CODE TO REQUIRE THAT RENTAL UNITS CAN MAINTAIN A SAFE INDOOR TEMPERATURE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TEMPERATURES ARE EXTREMELY COLD OR EXTREMELY HOT EVERY LANDLORD TO. FOR AND AIR CONDITIONING OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER. INSTEAD IT REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS TO ENSURE SAFE INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURE ON HOT DAYS BUT LEAVES IT UP TO THE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE HOW WE GET THERE. WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO ACHIEVE THE STANDARD WILL VERY BASED ON GEOGRAPHY AND A HOST OF OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING ENSURING CONSISTENCY WITH STATE CLIMATE GOALS. THE BILL DOES NOT DICTATE ANY OF THIS BUT INSTEAD SET THE PROCESS IN MOTION TO DEVELOP THE STANDARDS. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE A REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. AND TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE OUR AUGUST IN PEDRO PEDRO A TENANT AND RESIDENT OF MERCED. AND SASHA HARNDEN WITH THE INNER CITY LAWCENTER.

THE SCENTED CANDLES POLITICIAN THE CALL LOW FIX THEM FIRED YOU OUGHT TO PLEASE PASS THIS BILL WE DESERVE TO LIVE IN A- CENT HOLDER PROTECTS US FROM EXTREME HEAT. STILL THE YOU MAYBE GOOD AFTERNOON SASHA HUNTER WITH THE INNER LAW CENTER A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SEVEN- AS WE'VE HEARD HE RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATHS HAVE INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN RECENT YEARS AND STAND TO CONTINUE INCREASING DUE TO THE ACCELERATED FREQUENCY OF EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. THIS ISSUE HAS PARTICULAR IMPACTS WHERE PEOPLE SPEND THE MOST TIME AT HOME. HOWEVER THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR RENTAL HOMES IN CALIFORNIA TO MAINTAIN A SAFE MAXIMUM INDOOR TEMPERATURE. THIS FAILURE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS CHILDREN SENIORS AND THOSE WITH PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS WITH THE MOST EXTREME IMPACTS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS IS A PROBLEM EXTREME HEAT IS THE DEADLIEST CLIMATE HAZARD AND COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM HEAT RELATED ILLNESS EACH YEAR. ELECTED LEADERS HAVE STEPPED UP WHEN ISSUES OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE HOME PRESENT THEMSELVES. FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAGIC TWENTY FIFTEEN BALCONY COLLAPSE IN BERKELEY LED TO A SERIES OF LEGISLATION ADDRESSING ON TOWN BUILDINGS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN NUMEROUS LOCAL POLICIES REQUIRING SEISMIC RETROFITS OF SOFT STORY APARTMENTS. AND EXTREME HEAT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR SIMILAR ACTION. WE'VE LONG REQUIRED HEATING IN APARTMENTS TO ENSURE A SAFE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE HEN IT'S COLD. THIS BILL SIMPLY CREATES A COMPANION REQUIREMENT FOR SAFE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE AND RELIES ON THE BUILDING STANDARDS PROCESS TO DEVELOP THAT REQUIREMENT. WHILE HUMAN SAFETY MAKE OFFER A C. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL REQUIRES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNITS. AND A RANGE OF CLIMATE FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES LIKE WEATHER IS ATION EXIST TO HELP ACHIEVE SAFE TEMPERATURES. IN MANY REGIONS SIMPLE INSTALLATION OR SHADE TREES MAY DO THE TRICK. BUT GIVEN THE STATEWIDE IMPACTS OF THIS ISSUE A STATEWIDE STANDARD IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH SO THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THE PROPER STANDARD AND THIS BILL ALLOWS THAT PROCESS TO BEGIN. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE WE CANNOT STAND BY AS CALIFORNIANS SUFFER IN THEIR HOMES WE URGE ARRIVA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH IT WILL GO TO SUPPORT HER IN THE ROOM. MARINO I OR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON DISPEL BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- THAT IS PLAGUING MANY OF OUR MOST LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE STATE.

AND THE BUILDING SOUNDS COMMISSION TO ADOPT MANDATORY BUILDING STAF TO A CAR AC IN EXCESS AND BIT INTO WELL UNITS NUMBER TWO THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES RETROFITTING AN OLD DWELLING UNIT WITH A COOLING UNIT TO MEET THIS NEW CODE IS NOT A SIMPLE MATTER FOR EXAMPLE MANY APARTMENTS ARE NOT DESIGN- TO ALLOW FOR CENTRAL AC ALSO WE HAVE A LOT OF CUSTOM HOME BUILDERS AND ARE.

THE BILL- DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS TO EXPAND OUR WORK ON THE SHELTER CRISIS ACTS OF THE PAST THE EXTENT TO THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY. IT DECLARES ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A POPULATION UNSHELTERED HOMELESS. TO TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA BE INITIAL TO CRISIS WITHOUT WAY- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN AUTOMATICALLY OPT INTO A SHELTER. IT EXTENDS THE BUILDING STANDARDS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR CRISIS OUT TO SHELTERS LOCATED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY- AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S JUST EASIER. EASIER TO USE AND ALSO. TO- MAKE SURE. THAT WE EXPAND THIS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY JUST PUBLIC PROPERTY AS AMENDED THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW RESIDENTS OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS WILL BE TRAINS AND- TO PERMANENT. HOUSING WITH ME OR TO INCIDENT- AND THEY'RE GONNA TALK BOUT THE BILL AND CREATE YOUR- SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG MY NAME'S ADRIAN COVERT AND WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL BEAR COUNCILS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWO ELEVEN. AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY CALIFORNIA IS IN A SHELTER CRISIS CALIFORNIA IS HOME 212% OF ALL AMERICANS. 29% OF ALL HOMELESS AMERICANS AND 53% OF ALL UNSHELTERED HOMELESS AMERICANS MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO CALIFORNIA'S LARGE UNSHELTERED POPULATION IS IT'SINSUFFICIENT INVENTORY OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS. CALIFORNIA PROVIDES JUST THREE BEDS FOR EVERY TEN HOMELESS RESIDENTS LESS THAN ANY OHER STATE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FAR BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS SEVEN AND A HALF BEDS PER TEN. GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S SIZE IT WEIGHS DOWN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHEN INCLUDED TO SIX POINT TWO BEDS OUT OF TEN. THESE THIS IMBALANCE HAS ONLY GROWN WORSE OVER THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION INCREASED OUR INVENTORY OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS INCREASED JUST 6% SHELTER IS A BASIC HUMAN NEED WITHOUT WHICH OUR HEALTH DECLINES RAPIDLY. UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING PULMONARY DISEASE. HYPERTENSION DIABETES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS A AND INCREASED RISK OF PHYSICAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ASSAULT AN ACCIDENTAL DEATH BY REDUCING BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS. TO EXPANDING EMERGENCY SHELTERS AB TWENTY TWO ELEVEN WILL HELP EXPAND ACCESS TO BASIC SHELTER AND SANITATION THE CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS RESIDENTS AND BRING CALIFORNIA SHELTER INVENTORY CLOSER INTO LINE WITH THE NATIONAL. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY COMMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE. THE YOU VERY MUCH YOU CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY TANG MY NAME IS PETER I DO AM THE ASSISTANT TO THE CITY MAN WITH CITY OF BERKELEY I'M HERE TO WIN MAYOR ERROR AGAIN SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY TWO ELEVEN AND TO GIVE YOU A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE FOR HOW THIS BILL WOULD HAVE HELPED US IN BERKELEY IN TWENTY NINETEEN HAD IT BEEN WHAT THE TIME. I SOME TWENTY NINETEEN WE WERE APPROACHED BY FRED FINCH YOU SERVICES WHICH IS A NON PROFIT SERVING- TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THEY OWNED AND OPERATED A TWELVE BED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM IN SOUTH BERKELEY- AND AT THE TIME THEIR BOARD HAD MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT CONTINUING TO OPERATE THAT PROGRAM WAS N LONGER FINANCIALLY OR ADMINISTRATIVELY VIABLE FOR THEM. AND THEY WERE LOOKING TO SELL THE PROPERTY IN TRANSITION THE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER A NON PROFIT FORTUNATELY THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A WILLING BUYER IN COVENANT HOUSE CALIFORNIA IS THAT ANOTHER NONPROFIT SERVING TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AT THE TIME THEY OPERATED YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN BERKELEY AND D. AT LEAST ON THAT SHELTER WAS EXPIRING AND THEY WERE OUT WE AT RISK OF BEING DISPLACED IN ORDER FOR THE DEAL TO PENCIL OUT FOR KEPT COVENANT HOUSE THEY PROPOSED AN INTERIOR RENOVATION TO THE BUILDING THAT WOULD. ADDED THE THIRTY BED SHELTER IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING THE TWELVE BED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. AT THE TIME THE PERSON IN QUESTION WAS OWNED RESIDENTIAL IN BERKELEY THE EXISTING ZONING PERMITS DID NOT ALLOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE DADS AND OF COURSE CHANGING THE PARCEL'S ZONING WOULD HAVE BEEN A WINKY DISCRETIONARY PROCESS THAT WE SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE TIME FOR GIVEN THE EXPIRING WEEKS THAT I MENTIONED- BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY WAS NEITHER LEAST NOR OWNED BY THE CITY. WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD NO IN FORTY UNDER EXISTING LAUNDRY DISS AND SHELTER CRISIS LAW TO INVOKE A CRISIS TO WAIVE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE ZONING RESTRICTIONS EVEN THOUGH A CITY FUNDED HOMELESS PROGRAM HAD BEEN OPERATING THERE FOR LITERALLY DECADES WHEN STAFF BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE THE COUNCIL NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION WAS QUITE FIERCE AND ULTIMATELY. PROJECT BURKE WE LOST. THOSE THIRTY DAD'S. HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS A REAL I THINK. OF COMMONSENSE PRY. THAT CANNOT BE. AND EXPEDITED UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW. EXISTIR EXISTING SHELTER CRISIS BILL WOULD NOT-APPLIED. NORWOOD EIGHTY ONE OF ONE WOULD HAVE HELPED BECAUSE THAT LIES VERY. NARROWLY APPLIED ONLY TO NAVIGATION CENTERS. AND IN COMMERCIAL OR MIX AND MULTI FAMILY ZONING DISTRICTS. THIS IS WHERE AB TWENTY TWO ELEVEN WOULD HAVE HELPED US WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO WAIVE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH ZONING ON THE PRIVATE PARCEL. AND IT WOULD ALLOW US TO. APPLY THE SAME EMERGENCY HOUSING STANDARDS INITIALLY PROMULGATED AFTER EIGHTY NINE THIRTY TWO. TO THAT PRIVATE PARCEL- SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF MAYOR DEAN REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING ABOUT FOR ANYONE WHO ARE ONCE A SUPPORT.

SEEN MINISTER PELONIS PUSH OFF THEIR HOMELESS FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER WHICH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BUT THEN FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY WHICH IS IN EVEN MORE ACCEPTABLE SO UNACCEPTABLE. AND SOMETIMES EVEN ORGANIZATIONS- THAT ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING AS A NON PROFIT- THE CITY'S WILL FIND WAYS TO KEEP THEM FROM EVEN DOING THAT WORK SO THIS IS ESSENTIAL AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S IT SHOULD BE A TEMPORARY- A SCENARIO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- BUT NOT A THREE OR FOUR YEAR STAY BUT ALL OF THIS- FITS TOGETHER WITH ONE PIECE AFFECTING ANOTHER BUT I CERTAINLY AGAIN AS A LOCAL.

THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS FOR SOMEONE I THINK YOU AND THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. AND THE SPONSORS ON IMPROVING THE MEASURE. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED TO INSPECT PARKS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ALL RESIDENTS IN THE- IN THE PARK BY ISSUING HEALTH AND SAFETY CITATIONS TO RESIDENTS. AND OWNERS. IF A RESIDENT FAILS TO CORRECT A VIOLATION AFTER SIXTY DAYS THE PARK OWNER TO USE IN PERCY'S WHAT IS CALLED A NOTICE. TO SUSPEND A PERMIT TO OPERATE WHICH MEANS THAT THE PARK MAY LOSE A LOT A ABILITY TO COLLECT RENT FROM EVERY SPACE IN THE PARK. UNLESS THE VIOLATION IS CORRECTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WHICH CURRENTLY MEANS EVICTIONS FIRST IT CREATES A MECHANISM FOR THE H. C. D. TO CREATE A NEW GRANT FUND TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR THOSE THAT CAN'T. A FOR TO FIX A VIOLATION THAT THAT COULD ENDANGER THE LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS THE NEIGHBORS AND HE EVEN SURROUNDING CITIES. THINK THINKING FIRE PRONE AREAS SECOND THE BILL STATES- BILL STATES THAT THE THAT A PERMIT TO OPERATE WON'T BE. WON'T BE SUSPENDED FOR THE RESIDENTS VIOLATION HOWEVER I DID ACCEPTED MOVEMENTS TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF CITATIONS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE HEALTH SAFETY AND LIFE. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS BUDGET INCLUDED FIFTY MILLION FOR SIMILAR PROGRAMS TO ASSIST RESIDENTS AND IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE TO ALSO PUT A SUBSTANCE OF AB. TWENTY ZERO ZERO TWO INTO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL TO EXPEDITE HELP TO KEEP RESIDENTS IN THEIR HOMES. WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING SUPPORT OF AB TWO ZERO ZERO TWO. CHRIS WAS GOSSIPY LEVINE YES OKAY SORRY WITH WITH WESTERN MANUFACTURING HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION AND SHE SAID I KURT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE PARK ALLIANCE TWO MINUTES EACH THANK YOU HAVE A NUMBER GIVEN THE OUR WILL KEEP IT SHORT- GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIR HAS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON CHRIS WYSOCKI WITH WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION. AND FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING AB TWO THOUSAND TWO. RESIDENTS DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY WHEREVER EVERY RESIDENT ABIDES BY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RULES AND THE RULES OF THE PARK. THAT WAY EVERYONE IS ASSURED SAFE COMMUNITIES AND THAT ARE FREE FROM HAZARDS. FORTUNATELY A LOT OF RESIDENTS AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED FOR NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING TWO. AND INCLUDING NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE REPAIRS. THIS BILL IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THIS BY CREATING A PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY HCD TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO ACCESS FUNDS TO FIX HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. IN ORDER TO AVOID POSSIBLE INFECTION DUE TO NON COMPLIANCE IN AND SAFE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. THIS BILL CREATES THE MOBILE HEAD MOBILE HOME REPAIR GRANTS FUND AND WILL ENABLE OUR RESIDENTS TO ACCESS THESE FUNDS. THAT RESIDENTS CAN AFFORD TO FIX WITH THE STATE SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSING A MINIMAL AMOUNT COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING RESIDENTS KEEP ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS. IN ADDITION IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET HAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM. BUT IT'S ONLY LIMITED TO RESIDENT OWN PARKS AND NOT ALL PARKS. MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL OR PARTS OF IT INSERTED INTO THE BUDGET IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION TO IMPROVE HOUSING FOR MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS. AND TO PREVENT AN OWNER FROM HAVING THEIR PERMIT TO OPERATE BE SUSPENDED FOR RESIDENT ELATION. BEGAN WE SHOULD THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS AND KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON I COULD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE I WILL REPEAT MR WHY SAKI'S TESTIMONY BUT BUT JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS IS HE SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING A GOOD BILL. RIGHT NOW WHEN A RESIDENT HAS A VIOLATION AND CAN'T FIX IT. THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT THAT THAT A STATE. OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS IS ON THE PARK. AND THE PARK OWNER- BY REMOVING THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE BUILDING SOME ROOM. WHERE TO PARK HONOR HAVING TO MOVE DIRECTLY TO ADDICTION. ADDICTIONS ARE GOOD FOR RESIDENTS OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE NOT WANTED OR GOOD FOR THE PARK OWNER. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE WE ARE VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF ON BEHALF OF THE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. OF AB TWO THOUSAND TWO TIME WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE ROOM THERE IS ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL YOU CAN COME UP TO THE MIKE- WOULD YOU STATE YOUR NAME.

OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PUT THAT OUT. IF ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. THERE IS NO ONE VERY WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DAIS MISTER KALRA I BELIEVE YOU HAD A COMMENT. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I KNOW I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I BELIEVE IT IS STILL THE CASE A SAN JOSE HAS MORE. HOMES IN THE CITY IN THE STATE AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF MOBILE EMISSION FRANKLY WITH ORGANIZATIONAL REBUILDING TOGETHER WHENEVER THEY HAVE THESE. COME TOGETHER VOLUNTEER TO FIX UP HOMES. NINETY FIVE SENATORS TO A MOBILE HOME PARK BECAUSE OF ONE AND A LOT OF THE MOBILE HOMES. IN DISREPAIR LOT ELDERLY RESIDENTS AND I CALL MOBILE HOMES ESPECIALLY IN AREAS LIKE SELLING. THE BACK TO AFFORDABLE OUSING BECAUSE- CONSIDERING HOW MUCH HAPPENED AROUND THE MOBILE HOMES AND THE DEVELOPMENTS COME UP. OF THE REALITIES THAT MANY THAT LIVE IN MOBILE HOMES WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE. IN THE AREA WITHOUT THEM- INSIDE AND I AGREE WITH AND I LIKE TO UNDERLYING- THIS IS A BILL I DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THE- IF THERE IS A- ISSUE WITH THE PARTICULAR HOME TO. KIND OF. HOLD THE ENTIRE MOBILE HOME PARK YOU KNOW AT AT HARM BECAUSE OF IT. I GET THAT THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO MAKE SURE JUST TO PUT IT OUT THERE- IS AND I THINK THAT THE- THE NEXT BILL THAT IS A RELEASE IN A PRESENT MAYBE. THE SPONSORS YOU DON'T LIKE IT BUT I THINK THAT ACTUALLY DOES HELP. TO GO SOME. INTERNS THAT COMMUNICATION BUT- THE ONLY THE ONE THE ONE THING I MEAN I DO LIKE TO FIND. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE DO NEED MORE RESOURCES TO FIX UP SOME OF THESE ALMOST MOBILE HOMES- IS THAT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN BECAUSE WE DO SEE THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES. IS IT IS WHEN THEIR ISSUES IN A MOBILE HOME PARK THAT AREN'T RESOLVED. QUICKLY AND IN THIS CASE MAYBE THERE'S AN ISSUE. THAT OUR PARTICULAR RESIDENT HAS IS NOT RESOLVED QUICKLY. BUT NOW BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE ON THE MOBILE HOME PARK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO. LOSE THEIR PERMIT OPERATE THERE'S LESS OF AN URGENCY FOR THEM TOMAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUAL. RESOLVES IT. AS THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. AS LONG AS WE CAN THAT IS JUST RECOGNIZE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AND I KNOW MOBILE HOME PARKS IN GENERAL ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE. THE RESIDENTS UPKEEP WELL TO THE BEST THAT THEY CAN IN THIS CASE HAVE SOME RESOURCES TO HELP THEM. IF NECESSARY BUT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE. A PARTICULAR RESIDENT MAY HAVE ISSUES AND NOW BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT EXTRA PRESSURE. OF THE PARK LOSING LOSING ITS PERMIT. THERE MAY BE LESS OF A- URGENT FOR THE PARK TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. AND THEN THEY CAN CAUSE BLIGHT ON THE- NEIGHBORING PROBLEMS THAT MAKE SENSE. GALLIENUS JUST CLICK EVEN IN MIND AND MAY SURE THAT THERE'S A IF MAY BE THERE'S TRUMP- SOME. THAT CAN BE A THERE TO. MAKE CLEAR THAT THE OVERALL OF IS NOT TO. ALLOW A LOT KEEP THINGS REPAIRED A QUITE OPPOSITE THE ACTUAL FIND MORE. A BACK TO WAYS. TO RESOLVE ISSUES. I WOULD AGREE WITH IT. I MEAN JUST BECAUSE- I PUT MYSELF. I THINK IN THAT AS YOU SAID EARLIER. IT THERE'S A LOT OF SENIORS RIGHT- ELDERLY FOLKS. AND SOMETIMES.

I AM A SENIOR LIVING IN A MOBILE HOME PARK IN ST FE. AT THE- WELL REGIONAL MANAGER I AM CONSISTENTLY WORKING TO HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AT MY PARK AND SURROUNDING PARKS. AB TWENTY THIRTY ONE PROPILOT PROPOSES TO AMEND THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW TO PROMOTE IMPROVED COMMUNICATION. AND PROBLEM SOLVING BETWEEN MOBILE HOME HOMEOWNERS AND MOBILE HOME PARK MANAGEMENT. MANY PARK OWNERS AREN'T CIVIL CODE SEVEN NINE EIGHT POINT FIVE THREE TWO LITERALLY ALLOWING EITHER A MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS FOR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO MEET WITH PARK MANAGEMENT BUT NOT BOTH. THIS IS WHAT I WAS MEANT TO CREATE A VEHICLE FOR RESOLVING GRIEVANCES WHEN PARK MANAGEMENT READS THE LAW TO LITERALLY IT EXCLUDES INDIVIDUALS FROM THE MEETING. WHETHER IT BE A TRANSLATOR OR AN ADVOCATE WITH SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE WHO CAN HELP OF RESIDENTS NAVIGATE AND EXPLAIN THEIR ISSUE. WHEN PEOPLE SEEK REDRESS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. TO DO SO ALONE. BUT SHOULD THEY NEED A FIFTH. STATE LAWS. OF THE ALLOW THEM UTILIZE THIS. OF AND BE JOINED BY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS OR REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE STATE OF RESOLVING PROBLEMS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ALIGN ITSELF WITH THOSE CURRENT CALIFORNIA GOVERNANCE VALUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION BROUGH STANTON ON THE LINE. YES THANK YOU RICHARD SHERMAN BRIDGE STANTON ON BEHALF OF GSM A WELL ALSO IN SUPPORT I'M BASICALLY HERE JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- IT WOULD JUST REITERATE WHAT THE SUB CONNELL JUST TESTIFIED TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE ROOM ANYBODY WHO SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATION IS NOW IS THE TIME TO COME UP TO THE MIKE. AND EXPRESS THAT. AND IT'S A REALLY SCRAMBLING TO THE MIKE SO WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE LINE TO WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. FOR THIS MEASURE. YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. NO ONE IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK OKAY HELLO AND WE DOES NOT APPEAR WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES I'M SORRY KIND OF PASSED OVER THAT- WHO DO HAVE OPPOSITION WITNESSES. COME ON IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES MY APOLOGIES RIGHT. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE CPA DOES HAPPEN OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR MADE TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TODAY OR RATHER THE AND THEN THE CITY DID TAKE TODAY AND ESPECIALLY THE EFFORTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WENT INTO THAT- THE REMOVAL OF SUB D. FROM THE BILL ADDRESSES THE LARGEST CONCERN THAT SEEM PA HAD WITH THE BILL. WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TODAY SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS REMAINING AND WE DO NEED TO TALK TO OUR CLIENT ABOUT THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT AGAIN JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED- AND WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. NEXT THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR CHRIS WYSOCKI- WITH WESTERN MANUFACTURED. HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION AND WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE MET WITH- WE THINK. THIS THIS BILL AND REMOVING THE TEN DAY. ASSESS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP BUT IT'S ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL SO WE RESPECTFULLY MY STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO IT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE- BELIEVE IS THAT. THIS BILL IS SEEMS TO BE A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM IN MANY WAYS. IN THAT IT REALLY SEEMS TO ENCOURAGE THE- INTERACTION BETWEEN LAWYERS AND- AND THE- PARK OWNERS THAT SPECIALIZE IN MOBILE HOME PARK LAWSUITS- SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THERE'S A VALUE IN FACE TO FACE DISCUSSIONS AND WHAT WE APPRECIATE TELECONFERENCING AND VIDEO CONFERENCING. WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THE EXISTING M. R. L. CAN ALREADY ACCOMMODATE THAT- WHY DOESN'T THE CURRENT LAW WORK. WHERE BOTH PARTIES CAN ALREADY CONSENT TO IT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY EXAMPLES ABOUT- OTHER THAN GENERIC EXAMPLES. THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO US ABOUT WHY THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY NEEDED. SO WHY FORCE THIS BILL- ON A SUBSET OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE JUST MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS WHY NOT ALL LATE LAWYERS IN MEDIATION ISSUES ONE OF THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF. YESTERDAY ALONE THERE WERE TEN HEARINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ONLY THREE PROVIDE A CELL PHONE ACCESS. WITH THE SEVERE LACK OF HOUSING IN THE STATE. WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION CONTRIBUTES TO THE CREATION OF MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES TO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS. IN FURTHER WMA MEMBERS WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR RESIDENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS WE'RE A PARK MANAGERS LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE THEMSELVES- RESIDENTS. THE BILL SEEMS TO BE A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AGAIN. AND IT ALSO BELIEVE WE BELIEVE THAT IT CREATES A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT PARK OWNERS AND RESIDENTS HAVE AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP. AND THAT'S A NATION NOTION THAT WE FIRMLY REJECT SO FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- AND THEN. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS THERE ANYBODY IN THAT ROOM THAT WISHES TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL COME UP TO THE MIKE CAN DO SO. IF NOT EIGHTEEN D. OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN LINE FOR ANYBODY- IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE NINE ZERO. MISTER CHAIR KNOWING THE SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MISTER KALRA GO HEAD. I THINK THANK YOU THAT IS AS I MENTIONED DURING THE LAST- BILL- I DO THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A GOOD. PARTNER GO TO SOME EXTENT HAVING. DONE EXTENSIVELY- WITH MOBILE HOMES IN MY- IN MY CITY I OFTENTIMES WITH THE THAT THERE IS CONFLICT THAT ARISES AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S- AN IMBALANCE OF POWER WITH THE MOBILE HOMEOWNER IN THE-RESIDENCE- THAT OFTENTIMES MOST COMPANIES CAN BE RESOLVED IF THERE'S THAT BALANCE OF POWER AND COMMUNICATION- PARTICULARLY. WITH THE PRIOR BILL GOING FORWARD I THINK THERE'S A PRIVATE FIVE NUMBER TWO AND IF THERE ARE ISSUES. REGARDING MAINTENANCE- WEATHER'S MAINTENANCE AN ISSUE OF THE ACTUAL RESIDENT R OF THE PARK THAT COULD BE RESOLVED IN A IN A- IN IN A WAY THAT OTHERWISE MAYBE COULDN'T. AND OBVIOUSLY THE INTERPRETATION AND OTHER- ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE WE HAVE MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY A VIETNAMESE OR SPANISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS. AND OF HAVING THAT INTERPRETATION- IT'S A IT IS A CRITICAL IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AS WELL. THANK YOU. I AM BE ELSE MISS WARD READ ON THE- OKAY- NO THANK YOU FOR THE BUILDING FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK- BEFORE GIMME A LITTLE BIT THIS TO. AND I'M ALSO JUST TRAIN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPROVEMENT HERE- GIVEN WHAT THE EXISTING LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES WITH THIRTY DAYS NOTICE AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME EXPANSION OF- I GUESS TOPICAL MATTERS THAT YOU KNOW WOULD BE ADDRESSED NOT TAT CAN I CAN BE HELPFUL- DOES PULL DOWN THEN TO JUST- A REQUIREMENT TO. ENSURE THAT OWNERS ARE ABLE TO MEET SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A REPRESENTATIVE. YES BUT ALSO IF YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT WHAT COULD BE THE BENEFIT OF IT- ASK IF ANY OF MY SPONSORS FROM GSM OR TESTIMONY FROM GSM ALL WON AT LEAST TODAY HOW HE WOULD BENEFICIAL IN A KIND OF INTERPERSONAL CONTEXT YEAH IT THERE ARE YOU KNOW- JUST KNOWN- EXPERIENCE IS- REAL WORLD- EXPERIENCES OF MARTHA BURSE IF YOUR SONG YOU WANNA. SHOW AN EXAMPLE OR TELLING EXAMPLE HOUSLEY BENEFICIAL. BOB THIS IS MARCEL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THE IN THE SITUATIONS FOR THE PARK OWNERS TAKE THE POSITION. THAT THEY WILL NOT TALK TO ME AS THE ADVOCATE AND THE REPRESENTATIVE. IT'S COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE IT'S EVEN SO BAD THAT IF I SEND AN EMAIL ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENT TO THE PARK OWNER. THEY WILL CUT THE RESIDENTS OUT OF THE LOOP THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET THE EMAIL. THAT ALSO WORKS THE OPPOSITE WAY IF THE RESIDENT WRITES AN EMAIL AND COPIED ME THE PARK OWNER WILL COP WILL CUT ME OUT OF THE LOOP IT'S COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE. AND THEY WILL SAY WELL MARTHA WILL EITHER TALK TO YOU WITHOUT THE RESIDENT ARE WILL TALK TO THE RESIDENTS WITHOUT YOU. SO I SEE THIS IS A REALLY POSITIVE THING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN THE PARK THAT AND THERE ARE PARKS THAT LET BOTH THE RESIDENTS. AND THE RAP I TO THE MEETINGS WE WORK THINGS. AND IT HAVE TO ASK AND BY THE WAY I HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE CASE. AND I'VE HANDLED HUNDREDS OF THEM WERE IN ATTORNEY HAS COME INTO THE TO THE MEETINGS. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ME AS A NON LEGAL UNPAID ADVOCATE. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR YOUR QUESTION- IT DOES- I MEAN IF IT'S SOMETHING IF IT'S COMMUNICATION BY EMAIL THAT CAN ALWAYS BE FORTY ANNOYING BUT I CAN ALWAYS BE FORWARDED THE IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IS THAT. ANY AN OWNER AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AGAIN IN THE SAME SENSE OF INFORMATION THEY CAN DECIDE. HOW TO PROCEED- THREE DISAGREEMENTS HOPEFULLY TOGETHER- IN HI. CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO. AND SEE THE LAW TIGHTENS THE THAT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT THEY WOULD BE A TO PARTICIPATE. IN SUCH MEETINGS TOGETHER- YOU'LL BE BEYOND THAT IS THERE ANYTHING WITH THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND THEN I'M SORRY I'M I'M STILL FUNDAMENTALLY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHY THAT'S- WHAT THAT'S A DISAGREEABLE THINGS. WELL IF CHRIS WAS SECOND FROM WMA THE EXISTING AMARILLO ALREADY DEALS WITH MOST OF THIS ALL RIGHT. SO-THAT'S WHY WE JUST WE FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE BILL IS EVEN NECESSARY. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I MEAN THAT WE DO I THINK HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. IN TERMS OF THE VALUE AND PURPOSE OF THE EXISTING LAW VERSUS WHAT IS BEING AMENDED HERE TODAY- YOU KNOW AND AGAIN AGAIN I'LL REITERATE WHERE I STARTED WHICH IS WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TODAY BUT- THE- THE EXISTING LAW. AS PARK OWNERS IS THAT WE REPRESENT VIEW IT. IS ABOUT HAVING CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION AND- IN A NON LITIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE WE JUST HEARD FROM AN ADVOCATE BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WILL WE ARE EXPANDING THIS TO IN THE BILL. OUR ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS EXISTING LAW IS QUITE CLEAR THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS OF RESIDENTS. PARK OWNERS MUST MEET WITH BUT NOT REPRESENTATIVES IN INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS. THIS IS NOT A LEGAL PROCEEDING IT'S SIMPLY A MEET AND CONSULT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE RESIDENT. THE PARK OWNER IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE RESIDENTS LEGAL REMEDIES AFTER THE FACT. AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THERE IS A RISK THAT THE DISCUSSION BECOMES MORE LITIGIOUS IT IF A PARK OWNERS COMPELLED TO MEET. WITH A RESIDENT AND THE RESIDENTS. I MEAN FOR AS AT THE ALLOWED INTO THIS BILL SIMPLY THE RESIDENTS ATTORNEY AS A DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE. THEY ARE LIKELY OF COURSE TO BRING IN THEIR OWN COUNSEL AND AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONVERSATION WILL BE MUCH MORE LITIGIOUS AND THE RISK OF LITIGATION IS MUCH HIGHER IN THE RIGHT. FRAME LIKE HAVING TONE OF CONVERSATION THAT- HI- SO I'LL- BE. THE COURTESY TO. THE- THING THAT WORRIED ME TO AS A IMMEDIATE SORRY BUT THE LAW BUT ALSO AND- REAR BY THIS YOU KNOW- IN IN ALL FAIRNESS- YOU YOU KNOW IS THERE OR SHOULD THERE BE NO A LIMIT TO REQUEST SAID IF SOMEBODY IS- WANTS TO YOU KNOW HOW HAS IT HAS A GRIEVANCE AND YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO FILE A CLAIM THAT MST BE RESPONDED TO AND THEN NEXT WEEK THEY FILED A CLAIM IN THE WEEK AFTER THAT THE FOLLOWING OTHER CLAIM IS THERE. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID SORT OF A FAIR WAY OF- MAKING SHORT AND SHIP THAT THAT WE ARE- NOT BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS BILL- THAT THAT PRESENT YOU KNOW JUST A YOU KNOW A FURTHER ON HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THINGS TO THINK THROUGH I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH THEM ON SOME OF THEIR- ISSUES AND WANT TO TAKE AMENDMENTS- AND YOU KNOW LIKE ANYTHING WE DO HERE IS WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS- YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS GOING TO. IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY AND BE PROVEN FOR ALL PARTIES SELL ALL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY AND WATCHES. GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE THEM. AND WE'VE XIN. SO IF MISTER KALRA AND SET. MISC WITH THAT I HAVE IS FOR THE MOVING OUT OF COMMITTEE AND GO AHEAD AND TAKE ALL. I WAS SORRY WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THEIR THEIR FAVORITE IS. MY I A PRE THE- FROM THE OPPOSITION AND IT IS WITHIN MY PORTFOLIO WORK TO EXPAND ACCESS IS PRINCIPLES LANDING GROUND ACT FORWARDING ALL SORTS OF REFORMS MAKE SURE. EVERYTHING'S ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE ON THIS REALLY IS THE SAME PART OF IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS AND THEIR ADVOCATES THE REPRESENT OF WHOEVER THE HIGH AND CAN. CAN ALSO BE THE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER- BY NATURE OF THESE FOLKS WHO ARE IT'S USUALLY LOWER INCOME OR OLDER YOU KNOW NOT LOOKING FOR LITIGATION THE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS ISSUE AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WHEN THEY GET SOMEONE ELSE INVOLVED IT'S WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO HELP BALANCE OUT THE EQUATION OF THE POWER BALANCE. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT NOT SEEKING OUT MORE PROBLEMS BUT REALLY MISSING SOLUTIONS FOR FOLKS. IS PART IN ERIC AND I'LL CALL PUBLIC IF YOU WORK ON THIS BILL AND- ASK DR. THANK YOU. THE MOTION. TO PAY. IN THE- WEEKS I WEEKS I SAY ARE. YOUR TO KNOW. COULD CARILLO I. GAVE GABRIEL I CALL. COLOR HI KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK-SILVA. WARD WART I. THANK YOU TO. THAT BILLS FIVE TO TWO ITS OUT BUT WE BELIEVE IT OPEN. FOR OTHER FOLKS TO ADD ON ANYTHING WITH THAT NEXT WE'RE- GOING TO SEE- HERE MR GABRIEL'S- EIGHTY NINETEEN NINETY ONE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY OF ALLOWING ME TO GO AND WANT TO THANK OUR MAJORITY LEADER FOR THE CURRENCY WE HAVE A- WITNESS WHO NEEDS TO RUN TO THE AIRPORT- WANTED TO START OFF BY. ASKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL I'M PIECE TODAY TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN NINETY ONE- AND ALSO WANT TO THANK THE TENANTS RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS FOR WORK OF MY STAFF TO SHARPEN THE LANGUAGE AND LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE TO. WORK WITH THEM ON THE BILL TO MAKESURE THAT WE ARE NOT UNDERMINING ANY PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATE IN SHELTER PROGRAMS AND RESIDE TEMPORARILY IN HOTELS MOTELS OR OTHER SITES. MANY HOTELS AND MOTELS ARE FORCED TO pREMOVE PEOPLE FROM ROOMS EVERY FOUR WEEKS TO AVOID POTENTIALLY CREATING A LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIP. THE SHUFFLING PROCESS BY UNIT OWNERS IS PARTICULARLY DISRUPTIVE TO FAMILIES IN THESE PROGRAMS WHO MUST FIND NEW HOUSING EVERY THIRTY DAYS. THESE PRACTICES ALSO NECESSARILY CONSUME RESOURCES A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS WHO MUST SEARCH FOR OTHER HOUSING. IN OTHER CASES MOTELS AND HOTELS DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN SHELTER PROGRAMS OUT OF CONCERN THEY WILL STAB US LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIPS LIMIT SENSIBILITY OF AVAILABLE PROPERTIES FOR USE IN OKLAHOMA SERVICES. AB NINETEEN NINETY ONE CRATES PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDES LANDLORD TENANT CRAPPIE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. THIS BILL WOULD PER YOU KNOW OWNERS FROM IMPLEMENTING TERMINATION POLICIES THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET SHELTER PARTICIPANTS THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A GRIEVANCE PROCESS. AND ENSURES THAT VERY AFFORDABLE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT TERMINATED FOR PROGRAMS ARBITRARILY SET. AND ALSO ENSURES THAT HOTELS AND MOTELS COUNTRY OUR OWN HOUSE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN PERSON IS CHRIS FREE THE CHIEF PROGRAMS OFFICER LA FAMILY HOUSING A CO SPONSOR AND ON THE PHONE IS DONNA TANG FROM LHASA THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

FURTHERMORE THERE ARE NEW UNIFORM POLICIES FOR EXITING PARTICIPANTS FROM PROGRAMS CREATING INCONSISTENT SERVICE PROVISION ACROSS BOTH. LOCAL AND BY THE JURISDICTION AND THE STATE THAT ULTIMATELY- HARMS FRONTLINE STAFF AND THE PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLARITY. IN A AB NINETEEN NINETY ONE INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL PROVIDES DESPERATELY NEEDED CLARITY TO ADD TO STATE LAW AND IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS PARTICIPANTS PROVIDERS AND OPERATORS. AB NINETEEN NINETY ONE ENSURES THAT THOSE ACCESS SEEN IN TERM HOUSING AND SHELTER PROGRAMS ARE PROTECTED FROM UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS AND FEES IMPOSED BY MOTEL OPERATORS WHITE THE SAME TIME. BEEN MADE FULLY AWARE OF PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND RIVAS PROCESSES.

I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESSNESS ASSISTANCE ACT THIS BILL WILL HELP ON HOUSE TO CALIFORNIANS MEETS THE HIGH COSTS OF HOUSING BY PROVIDING RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO QUICKLY MOVED MOVE THEM OFF THE STREET AND INTO HOUSING. IN RECENT YEARS THE GOVERNOR AND STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE TAKEN TREMENDOUS STEPS TO COMBAT THE ONGOING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WHICH HAS ONLY WORSENED OVER NINETEEN AND EMIC DESPITE THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THE IMPACTS OF THIS CRISIS HAS LAST LEFT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS MOST OF WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. DATA FROM THE NATIONAL LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SEVERE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DRIVES OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHERE A PERSON WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THIRTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR. TO AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DIRECT RENTAL SUBSIDIES ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING HOMELESSNESS AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE SUBSIDY SUBSIDIES. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTEEN WILL PUT THIS RESEARCH INTO ACTION BY PROVIDING DIRECT RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THIS BILL IS ALIGNED WITH THE ONE TIME FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO BE SPENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WHICH COULD PROVIDE HOUSING FOR AN ESTIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND ON HOUSE CALIFORNIANS IN YEAR ONE. AND BY THE END OF FIVE YEARS TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE. FURTHER AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY.

AT PRESENT CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS DECADES IN THE MAKING ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT THERE ARE UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND ON HOW CALIFORNIANS SLEEPING ON THE STREETS OR IN THEIR CARS. AN UNCONSCIONABLE NUMBER. COUPLED WITH A STATEWIDE SHORTAGE OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES AND ONLY ONE SHELTER BED FOR EVERY THREE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE STATE'S HUMANITARIAN CRISIS HAS HIT A FEVER PITCH. WIDELY SEEN AS A STATEWIDE CRISIS AFFECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS THE CRISIS ACUTELY IMPACTS BLACK INDIGENOUS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. NOTABLY BLACK PEOPLE REPRESENT ONLY SIX POINT 5% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION BUT ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 40% OF CALIFORNIANS ON HOUSE. BY PARKER ALSO MOST LIKELY TO BE LOW WAGE WORKERS. MORE LIKELY TO BE RENT BURDENED AND MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT AND DIE FROM COVERED NINETEEN AND CLEARLY THE SHOWS THAT THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE STATE IS ALSO A RACE AND EQUITY CRISIS. EVERY PERSON TO DESERVES TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS AND NEEDS MATT AND OUR CURRENT SOCIAL SAFETY NET IS INSUFFICIENT GIVEN THE STATE'S UNCONSCIONABLE AND ACCELERATING WEALTH INEQUALITY AND STAGNANT WAGES. AS THE MAJORITY LEADER RIGHTLY NOTED YOU HAVE TO MAKE OVER THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR- TO ESSENTIALLY EXIST HERE. THIS MISMATCH BETWEEN INCOME AND HOUSING IS FUELING THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHES THE HOUSE CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE PROGRAM WHICH WILL HELP ON HOW CALIFORNIANS WITH THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING. AND PROVIDE RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO QUICKLY MOVE THEM OFF THE STREETS.

THE SEASON AGAIN. THANK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND THE DEDICATED WORK OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN IS A DISTRICT BILL SEEKING A SIMPLE FIX WITH A COMPLICATED WITHIN A COMPLICATED ISSUE AREA THE SURPLUS LAND ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE ALAMEDA NAVAL STATION AC AIR STATION WAS CLOSED AS PART OF THE BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE PROCESS IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS BLAND NOW KNOWN AS ALAMEDA POINT WAS CONVEYED TO THE CITY OF ALAMEDA IN ACCORDANCE ITH THE FEDERALLY APPROVED. FOR USE PLANS. ADDITIONALLY THE CITY OF ALAMEDA ENTERED INTO A LIKE LEGAL SETTLEMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TO DEDICATE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE HOUSING ON ALAMEDA POINT AS PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT AT ALAMEDA POINT HAS OVERCOME LITIGATION AND A LOCAL BALLOT MEASURE. THE LATEST ROADBLOCK WAS THE WELL INTENTIONED AMENDMENTS TO THE SURPLUS LAND ACT IN AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX OF TWENTY NINETEEN. APPLYING THE SURPLUS LAND ACT ALAMEDA POINT HAS CAUSED FURTHER DELAYS TO PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS. AND HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARDS TO BUILDING LEASED OUT FOR. COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN WOULD PROVIDE A VERY NARROW EXEMPTION TO THE SURPLUS LAND ACT FOR ALAMEDA POINT. AND IN DOING SO PROVIDE CLARITY IN A PATH FORWARD FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF ALAMEDA. THANK YOU AND AS WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE LISA MAXWELL FROM THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR WITH THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF ALAMEDA. AND A BIG WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALAMEDA POINT COLLABORATIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE NINETEEN TODAY MY NAME IS LISA MAXWELL AND I'M THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF ALAMEDA. ALAMEDA IS A SMALL ISLAND COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY HOME TILL IN THE NAVAL AIR STATION UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. WE REFER TO IT AS ALAMEDA POINT THAT THE CLOSURE OF THE NAVAL AIR STATION- NEGOTIATIONS WERE ENTERED INTO WITH THE NAVY AND THEY- BASE REUSE PLAN WAS CREATED- BUT STILL IS IN EFFECT TODAY AND WE STILL OPERATE ACCORDING TO IT- THE BASE THREE YEARS PLAN REQUIRES ALAMEDA. TO BE A MIXED DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES HOUSING. COMMERCIAL USES TO SPUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPEN SPACE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AS NOTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE SENATE SURPLUS LANDS ACT WAS AMENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS AMENDMENT WAS THAT FORMER MILITARY BASES LIKE ALAMEDA POINT. ARE MADE SUBJECT TO THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT THIS REQUIRES THE CITY TO PUT EACH PARCEL AT ALAMEDA POINT THROUGH A TIME CONSUMING SURPLUS PROCESS BEFORE DEVELOPMENT CAN CONTINUE. THIS MONEY CAN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL TO THE CITY BECAUSE THE LAND THAT WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE CITY TO THE NAVY IS NOT SURPLUS LAND FOR WHICH THE CITY HAS NO USE. AND SAID THE ALAMEDA POINT LAND IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE WITH THE NAVY IN TWO THOUSAND. AND PLAN FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT- IN CONNECTION WITH THE BASE REDUCE PLANT. REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED BY SALES A LEAKY LEASING AT ALAMEDA POINT ALLOW FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT THEY AMENDMENT HAS DRAMATICALLY STALLED SALES AND LEASING LEASING ACTIVITIES. IN FACT SINCE THE AMENDMENT OF THE SURPLUS LAND SECOND DURING TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. NO BUILDINGS AT ALAMEDA POINT WERE SOLD AND LEASING ACTIVITY WAS VERY MINIMAL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND ALAMEDA POINT MUST INCLUDE A TOTAL OF 25% AFFORDABLE UNITS. THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN IT HERE TO CONSISTENTLY SINCE DEVELOPMENT BANK BEGAN. THE TESTIMONY OF DOUG BIGGS WITH THE ELEMENT APPOINT COLLABORATIVE WILL PROVIDE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT. THAT THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE HAS ON THE HOUSING NEEDS OF RESIDENTS AND SECURELY MOST VULNERABLE REST. AB TWO THREE DOT ONE NINETEEN CREATES A VERY NARROW EXEMPTION ON THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SOLELY FOR THE CITY OF ALAMEDA. THIS THIS EXEMPTION IS NECESSARY SO DEVELOPMENT ALAMEDA POINT CAN CONTINUE UNHAMPERED AND WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. AS NOTED THE CITY'S CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED DID HEAR THE BASS YOU REUSE PLAN WITH THE NAVY AND PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ALAMEDA POINT WITHOUT THIS NEAR EXEMPTION THE CITY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN VIOLATING ITS CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR VIOLATING STATE LAW. NEITHER OF WHICH IS A VERY APPEALING OPTION FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR A VOTE ON AB TWENTY THREE NINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND YOU CAN BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON.

PLEASE BONTA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD I THINK IT POINTS OUT THAT WAY AS WELL INTENDED AS MANY OF OUR BILLS ARE SOMETIMES ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES NEED TO BE DEALT WITH- WITHOUT DAMAGING THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LAND OF THE- THEY- MEASURE OR THAT THE ACT AND THIS IS WHAT THIS DOES IS VERY NARROW- THERE ARE MANY CITIES THEY'RE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ALAMEDA ALAMEDA- THAT ARE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR ALAMEDA. AND IT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A LONG TIME.

NOTHING IF NOT TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH LABOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWERED AT THE PROVISIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FOR AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD STAY. MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS WEEKS. WEEKS I'D SAY OCTOBER. HI CARILLO. I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY QUIRK-SILVA PORT PORT I. THE BILL SIX ZERO IT'S OUT OF LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL FOLKS OUT ON. OKAY WE NOW HAVE. MISTER YEAH MISTER. WHAT WHY DON'T WE GO WITH MISTER STATO. MISTER VICE CHAIR'S GONNA. PRESENT. MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT YOUR. VERY TIMELY IN THE ORDER- ON WHEELCHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT TO INCENTIVIZE CITIES TO MEET CERTAIN HOSING GOALS BY REWARDING THEM WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR CITY PLANNING WHEN THEY MEET THESE HOUSING GOALS THIS BERYL BILL NARROWLY TARGETS LAND THAT WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDES A CARROT FOR CITIES WHO MEET THEIR ANNUAL. OUR HAVE MET THEIR ANNUAL HOUSING NEEDS. OUR NUMBERS AND INCLUDING LOW INCOME HOUSING. WHILE LARGE CITIES WITH NEARLY FULLY DEVELOPED ARE THAT ARE NEARLY FULLY DEVELOP STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE NEEDS MASTER PLAN CITIES HAVE CAREFULLY MAPPED OUT THERE HOUSING AND BUSINESS AREAS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW IN VERY RARE IN PRESCRIPTIVE CASES A CITY TO USE THIS LAND FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL OR USEFUL. SO I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN PLAIN ENGLISH WHAT THIS BILL WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AS THE SURPLUS LAND ACT YOU KNOW- HAS PUT CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON LAND THAT CITIES HAVE. MAY BE HELD FOR A WHILE- THAT CITIES MAY USE FOR- DOING A LAND LEASE- THAT IS NOT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND SO WHAT THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DO IF THEY ARE MEETING THEIR HOUSING NEEDS. IS TO DEVELOP THOSE. THOSE ARE TO ALLOW THOSE DIVINE TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE THIS LAND. WOULD NOT ORDINARILY BE- IT'S NOT GOING TO GET DEVELOPED IF THE CITY IS HOLDING IT AND IT'S AN SAY CIVIC CENTER AREA AND THE PLAN FOR THE CITY WAS TO HOLD THIS AND USE THE LAND LEASE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR OFFICE AND WHICH PROVIDES JOBS AND IT PROVIDES JOBS FOR BOTH WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION HAPPENS AND ALSO AFTERWARDS AND IT PROVIDES SUPPORT OF JOBS. AND SERVICES FOR THEIR SURROUNDING AREAS WHICH HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEM- THE- THIS TYPE OF LAND AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO NARROWLY WRITTEN. THIS TYPE OF LAND WOULD NOT BE USED. IT WOULD NOT BE OFFERED IT WOULD NEVER BE OFFERED UP BECAUSE THE CITY'S CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THAT LAND TURNED INTO SOMETHING THAT. ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATES THEY'RE PLANNING FOR A DOWNTOWN CIVIC CENTER TYPE SPACE. AND THIS WOULD NORMALLY I WOULD SAY WOULD I WOULD NORMALLY MAKE THIS A DISTRICT BILL IF I COULD BECAUSE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF THE CITIES THAT. ARE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE- TWENTY YEARS AGO- I WAS INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING FOR THIS COMMUNITY. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND THIS WAS PART OF THAT PLAN WAS INSTEAD OF BURDENING THE TAXPAYERS BY TAKING OUT BONDS IN BUILDING THESE ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE. THE LUCK OF THE LAND FOR THE CIVIC CENTER WOULD HOUSE THE POLICE STATION LIBRARY SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER CITY HALL AND THEN THE LAND LEASES WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP PAY FOR THE BONDS FOR THOSE OTHERS. AND IN THE MEANWHILE THIS AREA IS OUR OUR- GUITAR JONES FOR. HIGHER DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. WHEN WE SPOKE WITH OTHER CITIES ABOUT THIS THEY WERE HAVING THE SAME TYPES OF ISSUES. SO WE REALLY NARROWLY CRAFTED THIS. SO THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSED. AND USED IF CITIES WERE MEETING THEIR HOUSING NEEDS AND ALSO WHICH INCLUDE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ELEMENT. IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THERE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET AND THERE'S MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- JUST DOWN AROUND THE BLOCK FROM HERE. THIS CIVIC CENTER WAS MEANT TO DO THAT IN OTHER CITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING LIKE OUR CITY HAS BEEN IN MARIETTA. ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. SO WE CAN NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL THAT HELPS THEM GET PAST THAT HURDLE. WE CAN GET THOSE LANDS USE USABLE FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THAT THE EXIST- THE BUILDING OF THE OTHER- THE REST OF THE HOUSING PART IS SUPPORTED BY THAT THAT VERY DEVELOPMENT. SO THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THIS BILL- READING THE BILL LANGUAGE IT'S VERY CONVOLUTED IT'S VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- WE HAD TO CHANGE IT INTO. YOU KNOW BILL LANGUAGE I GUESS. AND BUT WHAT IT DOES IS JUST ALLOW CITIES. TO HAVE THAT SMALL EXEMPTION IN VERY PARTICULAR CASES. JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE WE JUST HAD IT WAS A PARTICULAR CASE THAT THAT'S HOW YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND SO WITH THAT. I DO HAVE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. JASON RYAN WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY HELLO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAID JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES A GIVEN LATE HOUR OF GRIEF. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. IT IS NEARLY TAYLOR LIKE THE AUTHOR HAS MENTIONED- IT IT'S ONLY GOING TO PROVIDE THE FEXIBILITY TO JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE MEETING OR EXCEEDING THEIR PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENA ON THE GOALS OF THE STATE HAS GIVEN US A CITY'S GONNA HAVE TO BE VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE NOT ONLY. IN REMOVING BARRIERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO ACTIVELY SEEK ALL SORTS OF FUNDING IN ORDER TO GET THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT. HISTORY SHOWN- THAT NOT VERY MANY JURISDICTIONS EVEN THROUGH THE BEST INTENT. CAN HAVE PROGRESS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS- WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM A TO GET CITIES TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER AS POSSIBLE TO GET AFFORDABLE UNITS- CONSTRUCTING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IF THEY DO THEY'RE GONNA GET VERY VERY MODEST FLEXIBILITY ON THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT. WITH THAT WE ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU TO HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM HAD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR- FOR AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT. GO TO THE PHONE LINES OPERATOR SUPPORT FOR AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. JUST A MOMENT. GOING TO GO TO LINE. TWO THIRTY. GET ACTING CHAIR MEMBERS THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE WE LOCK A FELLOW REPRESENTING FIFTEEN MARIETTA AND WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT AND APPRECIATE OUR STOCK NUMBER FOR BRING THIS ITEM FORWARD. THANK YOU. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK. GREAT WILL BRING IT BACK HERE- TO HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S EVAN T. AS IN ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OR IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN PICTURES AND AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO FOR THE HOUSING BUILDERS ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. AND RESPECTFUL POSITION AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WE APPRECIATE EFFORTS TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR MEETING ARENA REQUIREMENTS. CREATING EXEMPTIONS IN THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. IS UNDER MY IS VERY SENATE PARTS TO ME ARE FOR THE HOUSE GOALS. THE STATE SURPLUS LAND ACT AS A LANDMARK FIFTY ALONG THAT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS LEGISLATURE STRENGTH STRENGTH- TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO ME ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS. AND RECOGNIZING THAT THAT LAND PRICES ARE AT A PREMIUM AND THAT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT JURISDICTIONS HAVE A REALLY BIG ROLE TO PLAY. AND WE APPRECIATE THEM AS GOOD PARTNERS IN MAKING THE MOST USE OF THESE RESOURCES FOR HOUSING SOLUTIONS. THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EXEMPTION HAVE A COUPLE OF CONSTRAINT PRECEDENCE FOR US. WHILE THE BILL DOES FOCUS ON LAND THAT'S ZONED TO THIRTY RESIDENTIAL UNITS. AND THIS MAY NOT SMUGGLERS OF. DISTILLED OF LUCK BETTER ACTIVE INTEREST AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS INCLUDINGSOME OF OUR MEMBERS OF OUR MEMBERS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL. A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST AND I DON'T DO WE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE ADDITIONALLY THE DENSITY MISSILES THE LEGISLATURE PROVEN LAST FEW YEARS THEY ALLOW US TO ADD MORE UNITS THESE PARCELS WHERE THEY WORK- BEYOND THE THIRTY UNITS AND HE'S PROCESS COULD HOUSE DOZENS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND WE CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO LET THEM SLIP BY DURING THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND LASTLY THE BILL SPECIFIES ANY LOCALITY THAT'S MADE ANNUAL PROGRESS TOWARDS ARENAS. I PASSED. AWAY FOR. SO AND APPRECIATE THE- NEED TO PROGRESS ON THESE. BOLTS REWARDING THEM FOR FONG TATE HOUSING LAW BY EXENDIN EXEMPTING THEM FROM OTHER STATE HOUSING LAWS. IS NOT A WORTHWHILE POLICY TRADE OFF. WE NEED ALL THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES AT OUR DISPOSAL FOR TO MAKE A DENT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS NOT JUST IN THIS CYCLE BUT IN FUTURE CYCLES AS WELL WE WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW THESE POLICIES AVAILABLE FOR US TO CONSIDER. AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEY'LL BE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS BEST THERE- WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER BETTER KINDS OF INCENTIVES WE CAN SUPPORT WHETHER THAT BE INCREASED FUNDING FOR CITIES OR STATE GRANTS. AND AS WE FACE A STARK HOUSING CRISIS AND WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF A MILLION PLUS AFFORDABLE HOMES THAT WE NEED TO CREATE- WE NEED TO PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN THE SLA. AND ARCADE EXEMPTIONS TO APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION TODAY I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR- BUT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK HEARING OF IT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER FOLKS IN THE ROOM WHAT WISH EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO A. B. SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT.

YOU KNOW I'M- I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT IT'S SORT OF REWARDING THE- CAN I CLOSE YES WHAT DO YOU CLOSER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MR. SO THIS BILL IS NEARLY TERROR AND TAILORED ON PURPOSE IT'S BECAUSE IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED SO THIS THAT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LANDS THAT FALL INTO THESE PARTICULAR CASE TYPE OF SITUATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON USING THOSE PLANS THEY WILL NEVER BE OFFERED UP FOR AWHILE HOUSING THE CITY COMMUNITIES WILL WIND UP HAVING TO SIT ON THOSE LANDS UNTIL THEY CAN AFFORD TO BE THE DEVELOPER THAT BUILDS ALL OF THE- ANCILLARY OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING INTO A FOR A PROJECT LIKE THAT- AND- SO. YOU KNOW I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION'S. CONCERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE BUT IN AREAS OUT IN- VIA IN MY COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A LOT OF LAND AVAILABLE AND IT'S- A LOT OF THAT LAND. IS ZONED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISN'T NECESSARILY BEING HELD UP. BY NOT HAVING THE LAND IT'S BEING HELD UP BY A PROCESS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING. SO I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS THIS IS NOT A AN ATTACK ON THE ACT. IT IS SIMPLY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS INCLUDING THE PEOPLE WHO WIND UP LIVING IN THE ADJACENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE AROUND.
