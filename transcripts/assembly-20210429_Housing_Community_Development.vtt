PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:24.882
THE GOVERNOR REQUIRES H. C. D.

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:27.217
TO BETTER ALIGN THEIR SIX MAJOR

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:30.320
FUNDING SOURCES AND THEY WILL

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.523
ALSO BETTER ALIGN WITH PARTY

00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:35.692
CAC AND SEDLAK PROCESSES. TO

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.694
PUT IT IN THE SIMPLEST FORMS

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:40.097
SIMPLEST TERMS THE SYSTEM IS

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:42.432
WORKING. I CAN SAY THAT

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:43.167
CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.602
EFFICIENT OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:47.738
PROCESS FOR ALLOCATING AND

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.573
AWARDING TAX CREDITS AND BONDS

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.241
COMPARED TO ANY OTHER STATE IN

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.310
THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.145
SYSTEM THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:57.181
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:58.882
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS. ME

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.185
EMPHASIZES AGAIN. IN THIS TIME

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:05.088
OF CRISIS OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING.

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.391
CERTAINTY OF EXECUTION IS KEY

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:08.058
TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.227
DEVELOPERS PROPOSING A WHOLE

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:12.062
NEW OVERHAUL AT THIS TIME IS

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:14.398
RISKY AND CREATES UNCERTAINTY

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:17.000
IN THE MARKET PLACE. THIS BILL

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.535
IS TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:20.938
THAT DOESN'T EXIST. INSTEAD OF

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:23.006
EXPEDITING HOUSING THIS

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.174
LEGISLATION COULD

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.276
UNINTENTIONALLY HAMPERING. IT

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.744
COULD BURY THE FOR HOUSING

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.680
AGENCIES UNDER ANOTHER LEVEL OF

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.115
BUREAUCRACY. IT WILL FORCE A

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.585
DISRUPTIVE TRANSITION AT A TIME

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:35.752
WHEN WHAT IS NEEDED IS

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.821
STEADFASTNESS STEADY

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.856
STEADINESS. AND I BELIEVE IT

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:41.525
WILL STIFLE AND SLOW DOWN OUR

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:42.726
CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.629
PRODUCTION WHICH IS PERFORMING

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.197
AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL THAN EVER.

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:48.332
I ALSO BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:49.800
BE A SEPARATION OF DUTIES

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:51.301
BETWEEN HOUSING POLICY AND

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:54.271
HOUSING FINANCING. IN THE PAST

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:54.905
THERE HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR'S THAT

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.107
DID NOT SUPPORT FOR WORK IN

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.008
DIFFERENT TO AFFORDABLE

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.043
HOUSING. SO HAVING ALL THE

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.678
HOUSING DECISIONS AND FINANCING

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:04.114
UNDER ONE ROOF WOULD REMOVE

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.049
COMPETITION AND CREATE A

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:08.118
POLITICAL SYSTEM WHERE STAFF

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:09.786
PICKS AND CHOOSES THEIR

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.822
FAVORITE PROJECTS. I REAFFIRM

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:12.723
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.691
SHOULD BE THE POLICY ARM AND

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:16.093
THE CHARGERS OFFICE SHOULD BE

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:17.828
THE FINANCING ARM. WE ARE

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:19.396
WORKING COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:21.498
OUR SISTER AGENCIES AND ARE

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.767
SURPASSING EXPECTATIONS AS WE

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:24.835
STRIVE TO HIT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:28.005
GOAL A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:29.640
NEW HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.475
I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF REFORM

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.210
WHEN NEEDED. I WAS ELECTED TO

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:34.878
THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.747
TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WHEN I

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.015
CHAIRED THE BOARD IN MY SECOND

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:40.417
YEAR. I REQUESTED THREE OUTSIDE

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.219
AUDITS THAT RESULTED IN THE

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.388
LARGEST REFORM. THE BOARD OF

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:46.757
EQUALIZATION HISTORY AND MOVE

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:48.392
THE ADMINISTRATION AN APPEALS

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:50.127
PROCESS UNDER THE GOVERNOR

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:52.262
WHICH WAS MUCH NEEDED. HOWEVER

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:54.564
THE STATE'S HOUSING AGENCIES IS

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.900
A DIFFERENT SCENARIO. THE MAIN

00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:59.269
PROBLEM WE HAVE MEMBERS IS THE

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:02.039
LACK OF BOND ALLOCATION WHICH

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.073
IS LIMITED BY THE FEDERAL

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.676
GOVERNMENT AND IS OUTSIDE OF

00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:08.645
THE STATE'S CONTROL. WE NEED

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.547
COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING SOLUTIONS

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.050
NOT A PIECEMEAL APPROACH AS A

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:15.018

THE COMMITTEE- I WANT TO STATE

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.650
A FEW WORDS- JUST TO LET MY

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:01.751
PERSPECTIVE I KNOW A NUMBER OF

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.553
YOU HAVE COME UP TO ME THE LAST

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:04.887
FEW HOURS ASKING ABOUT THIS.

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.089
LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.624
HAVE- SURE THE GREATEST RESPECT

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.293
FOR TREASURE. I KNOW SHE IS

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.028

THIS TIME PERIOD FROM MY

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:14.697
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT'S

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.798
IMPORTANT NOTE THIS AND LET THE

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.633
RECORD REFLECT MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.269
THIS BILL DOES NOT REFLECT

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:20.870
ANYTHING ON HER LEADERSHIP OR

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.139
HER WORK- AND I ALSO WANT TO

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.273
MENTION THAT- THE TREASURE AND

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.541
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK ABOUT

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:26.776
THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEW

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.244
DAYS AGO. WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.413
THE OPPOSITION- AFTER RATES UP

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.948
THE BILL AND INDICATED MY

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.717
SUPPORT FOR THIS CONVERSATION-

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.119
LET ME SAY THIS I THINK IT'S

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:36.986
FAIR TO SAY THAT THE

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.422
COMPLEXITY. OF STATE FINANCING

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.424
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS LONG

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.426
BEEN AN ISSUE. THIS IS PREDATED

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.594
THIS GOVERNOR PREDATED THIS

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.063
TREASURE THIS CONTROLLER AS WE

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.764
HAVE. BEEN TRYING TO GRAPPLE

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.032
WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS I THINK

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.634
IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT IN

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:52.969
RECENT YEARS WE HAVE INFUSED

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.103
MORE MORE MONEY INTO THE

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.805
SYSTEM. OUR PRIVATE ACTIVITY

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:56.639
BOND HAS BECOME MUCH MORE

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.674
COMPETITIVE THAT COMPLEXITY HAS

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.344
INTENSIFIED AND THE REALITY IS

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.278
WE'VE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.414
ENTITIES HCD. TELL EACH OF A.

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:08.518
T. CAC SET LACK. THAT ARE ALL

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:11.621
PART OF THIS PUZZLE- AND I

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:12.989
THINK IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:13.623
THEY'RE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.158
ON WHETHER. HE'S HOUSING

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.292
SYSTEMS ARE WORKING AND WHETHER

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.727
THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:21.197
THAT WE CAN DO IT- AND I HAVE

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.532
THOUGHT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.799
A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.234
BETTER ALIGN OUR HOUSING

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.069
FINANCING SYSTEM. WHICH IS WHY

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.604
I THOUGHT INITIALLY WHY THIS IS

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.506
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. UP TO

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.074
OTHER OBSERVATIONS I THINK IT'S

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.776
FAIR TO SAY THAT NONE OF US IF

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:34.877
WE HAD BUILT THE SYSTEM FROM

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.113
SCRATCH WOULD HAVE DIVIDED THE

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.880
RESPONSIBILITIES UP IN THE WAY

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.682
THAT WE HAVE- BUT GIVEN WHERE

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.284
WE ARE. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION A

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.486
WHAT WE DO MOVING FORWARD- AND

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.188
THEN ALSO JUST POINT OUT AND

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.422
THIS I KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.257
WE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.993
THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.730
THESE AGENCIES IT SIMPLY SAYS

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:55.765
THAT WE ARE ASKING OR SAID J.

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:56.399
THE JOINT ESTABLISHED. AND THE

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.634
OP. OF A SINGLE HOUSING FUNDING

ALLOCATION COMMITTEE SO- NUANCE

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.239
IN THIS- BUT I HAVE ASKED THE

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:05.041
AUTHOR. IF THIS BILL MOVES

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:06.175
FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE TO

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.477
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. THE DIVERSE

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.749
DONE AND- AND I KNOW HE'S

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.051
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT SO.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:15.952
JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.286
PERSPECTIVE AND OF COURSE OPEN

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.689
UP TO OTHERS FOR COMMENT.

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:22.558
MISTER CAR. THANK YOU MISTER

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.427

LAID OUT OF A PERSPECTIVE IN

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:29.565
AND- THE THAT I THINK- I SHARE.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.633
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.903
AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT HE- PUTS

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:34.804

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.139
TRYING TO FIND. COLLABORATION

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.976
AND- IN IN GETTING TO- THE END

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.344

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.580
THAT SHE'S SHE DOES THE SAME. I

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:49.619
DON'T KNOW BASED UPON- THE-

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.953
NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:51.887
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ABILITY

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.689
TO GET TO THAT COMPROMISED

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.558
POSITION BUT I CERTAINLY WANT

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.792
TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE BENEFIT

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.761
OF THE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.597
TRY- AND YOU KNOW WE CAN MOVE

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:02.531
FORWARD I THINK THERE'S

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.000
CERTAINLY ROOM FOR SO

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.569
EFFICIENCIES BUT- MID TO THE

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:07.903
UPPER OF THE TREASURES POINT

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:08.938
THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.506
GREAT WORK DONE UNDER THE

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.607
CURRENT SYSTEM AND SO WE WANT

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:12.908
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. GETTING

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.710
IN OUR OWN WAY OF THAT WELL

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.912
TRYING TO FIND AN EFFICIENT

MANNER REARDING THE FUNDING

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:20.516

WE MIGHT BE INJECTING A LITTLE

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.815
BIT OF RISK AND THAT THAT THAT

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.283

COULD LOOK LIKE ABOUT SOME KIND

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.630

EFFORT HERE- BETWEEN ALL THESE

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.168
ENTITIES- BUT MAYBE THAT

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.469
TRIGGERED IT WOULD BE ON THE

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.605

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:21.977
SIXTY SEVEN. DIFFERENT

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.680
AGENCIES- AND THE WAY THE

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:26.315
SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW THERE IS A

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:28.317
CHECK AND BALANCE THERE IS. A

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.853
SEPARATION OF DUTIES WE ARE ALL

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.555
RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.191
INDIVIDUALLY AND I JUST WANT TO

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.860
ALSO ADD THAT IN NEW YORK WHERE

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:39.828
EVERYTHING IS UNDER ONE ROOF.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:42.665
IT TAKES EIGHT YEARS. FOR THEM

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.266
TO GET PROJECT THEM EIGHT YOUR

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.568
PIPELINE. AND IF YOU ASK ANY OF

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.804
THE FOLKS WHO WERE ON THE LINE

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.939
ASK THEM HOW LONG IT TAKES. TO

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.775
OUR SYSTEM GIVEN THAT THEY

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.043
EITHER HAVE THE FUNDING

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.844
MECHANISM OR- THROUGH THE

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.346
COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE HAVE

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.715
THREE ROUNDS EVERY YEAR. AND

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.317
THEY ARE ALL ABLE TO COMPETE

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.085
AND THEY COMPETE BASED ON A

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:06.121
VERY TRANSPARENT POINT SYSTEM-

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:08.290
WHAT PEOPLE CAN WATCH OUR YOU

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.325
KNOW OUR OUR MEETINGS. AND SO

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:11.894
WE HAVE A VERY VERY EFFICIENT

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.762
SYSTEM COMPARED TO EVERY OTHER

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.330
STATE AND SO IF THE SYSTEM

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.599
ISN'T BROKE. WHY DO WE WANT TO

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.568
CHANGE IT. SO HAVING THE

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.270

AS A CRISIS- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:33.922
AT WINNING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.624
COMES TO THE FINANCING OF IT.

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.559
YES THERE ARE A FEW NATIONAL

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.261
CONGLOMERATES THAT HAVE LEARN

RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:45.033
NAVIGATE BUT FOR RIGHT NOW-

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.702
THERE ARE MANY THAT CAN'T

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.305
DESIRING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.507
HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.209
CHALLENGES ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.712
ONE SINGLE STATE AGENCY. AND I

01:16:56.778 --> 01:17:00.048
APPLAUD I ABSOLUTELY- COMMEND

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:03.485

PURVIEW AND TIME. AND OFFICE

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.124
BUT THE CHALLENGES REMAIN

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:12.294
LARGER THAN A STATE AGENCY OR A

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.962
PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT SO WITH

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.964
THAT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR.

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.366
THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.534
STATE WATER THE TURNER CENTER

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.069
AND MY WITNESSES ARE NOT A

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.772
RESULT OF ACTION. OR IN ACTION

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:25.841
BY ANY INDIVIDUAL AGENCY OR

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:28.143
ADMINISTRATION. THE REALITY IS

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.644
THAT THE CURRENT DYSFUNCTION IN

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.179
OUR STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:33.782
FINANCE SYSTEM. IS A SYMPTOM OF

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.884
A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT IS

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.053
LARGER THAN ANY ONE OFFICE. SO

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.389
WE NEED A SOLUTION OF THE TO

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.424
COMMENSURATE WITH THE SCALE OF

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.092
THE PROBLEM. AND I BELIEVE THIS

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.395
BILL WILL SET US ON A PATH. TO

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.863

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.866
SOLUTION AGAIN I AM COMMITTED

SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:39.099
FIVE OH TWO- BE ISSUE. AS I SEE

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:42.402
IT IS THE- PREMISE OF ELECTING

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:43.536
DIRECTOR NOMINEES BY

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:47.140
ACCLAMATION AS THE MODIFIED-

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:48.108
FIFTY ONE HUNDRED G. WOULD SET

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:51.044
FORTH- THE STATED GOAL IS TO

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.679
AVOID ELECTIONS BUT THAT IS

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:54.347
ACTUALLY A BIT OF A MISNOMER.

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.983
THERE IS IN FACT AN ELECTION IT

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:59.052
BUT IT'S ONE HELD EXCLUSIVELY

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:01.087
BY SEATED BOARD MEMBERS. THAT

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:03.156
HISTORICALLY ACCLAMATION IS A

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:05.058
VOTE BY CHEERING HER SHOUTING

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.826
RATHER THAN BY AN ACTUAL

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:10.130
BALLOT. SO THE QUESTION FOR

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.865
THIS- COMMITTEE IS. HOW

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:13.800
IMPORTANT IS THE BALLOT TO THE

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.235
LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:17.670
PROCESS. SO I THINK IF WE START

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.039
WITH THE PREMISE THAT COMMON

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:20.173
INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE IN

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.042
FACT BECAUSE I GOVERNMENTAL

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:24.077
ENTITIES IN FACT MANY CASES

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:26.279
HAVE SO HELD BECAUSE ACTIONS BY

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.448
THE H. AWAY BOARDS. CONSTITUTE

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.850
PRIVATE CONDUCT THAT IMPACTS A

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:32.185
BROAD SEGMENT OF SOCIETY AND

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.520
THEREFORE CONSTITUTES MATTERS

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.889
OF PUBLIC INTEREST. SO DENYING

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:37.657
A BALLOT VOTE ON MATTERS THAT

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.926
DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY IN

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:42.228
FACT IN MEMBERS HOMES PRINCES

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.663
LEGISLATION DIRECTLY IN THE

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:45.231
REALM OF VIOLATING

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:46.666

QUANTITY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.205
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.240
LEGISLATION OPENS THE DOORS TO

01:51:54.307 --> 01:51:56.643

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.425
MECHANISM TO QUELL DISSENTING

STATED GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION

IS COST SAVINGS BUT THAT CAN

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:23.837

THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:05.317
IN THE NATION. BUT IT'S

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:06.151

02:12:06.218 --> 02:12:08.720
HOMELESSNESS. IS DISJOINTED AT

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:38.435
REALLY ADDRESS A LOT OF OUR

02:44:38.501 --> 02:44:39.102
HOMELESSNESS SOLUTIONS

02:44:39.169 --> 02:44:41.271
COMPREHENSIVELY- AS A NEW

02:44:41.338 --> 02:44:42.706
MEMBER I WAS A FORMER CHAIR OF

02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:44.174
OUR C. OR C. IN SAN DIEGO

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:45.408
COUNTY AND OF COURSE OF THE

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:46.509
COUNCILMEMBER REPRESENTING SOME

02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:47.310
OF THE MOST IMPACTED

02:44:47.377 --> 02:44:48.178
NEIGHBORHOODS THIS ISSUE

02:44:48.245 --> 02:44:50.280
STRIKES ME VERY- PERSONALLY

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:51.514
THAT I'VE INVESTED A LOT AND WE

02:44:51.581 --> 02:44:52.816
HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER FOR

02:44:52.882 --> 02:44:54.217
STATE. WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:55.518
NEED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL

02:44:55.585 --> 02:44:57.187
RESOURCES AND WE KNOW WE NEED

02:44:57.254 --> 02:44:59.089
THOSE RESOURCES TO BE ON GOING

02:44:59.155 --> 02:45:00.257
ON THIS IS GOING TO BE A MULTI

02:45:00.323 --> 02:45:01.658
YOUR PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE

02:45:01.725 --> 02:45:02.359
THAT WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY

02:45:02.425 --> 02:45:04.127
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE

02:45:04.194 --> 02:45:05.028
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS

02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:07.497
BUDGETS- CYCLE COMING UP WE'LL

02:45:07.564 --> 02:45:08.031
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT

02:45:08.098 --> 02:45:09.499
THAT'S ONE TIME FUNDING THE

02:45:09.566 --> 02:45:11.601
ESTABLISHMENT OF A ON GOING

02:45:11.668 --> 02:45:12.502
REVENUE STREAM I THINK IT'S

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:14.371
CRITICAL- AND IT NEEDS TO BE

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:16.106
HEALTHY WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM

02:45:16.172 --> 02:45:18.108
FACING A STATEWIDE- AND IT'S

02:45:18.174 --> 02:45:19.709
GOING TO DEMAND. THE RESOURCES

02:45:19.776 --> 02:45:20.877
NECESSARY TO PLAN FOR AND

02:45:20.944 --> 02:45:22.979
EXECUTE APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS

02:45:23.046 --> 02:45:25.148
FOR HOMELESSNESS ON THIS THE-

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:25.949
IN THE SENATE VERY

02:45:26.016 --> 02:45:27.851
COMPREHENSIVE BILL THAT BOTH-

02:45:27.917 --> 02:45:29.319
ADDRESSES THAT FUNDING IT'S

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.220
IMPORTANT WHERE YOU GOING TO

02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:32.489
PAY FOR IT BUT ALSO MAKE SURE

02:45:32.555 --> 02:45:34.491
ON THAT WE ARE PROVING UPON OUR

02:45:34.557 --> 02:45:36.026
ARE. WHERE THE FUNDING IS

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.794
DIRECTED- AND HOW WE ARE

02:45:37.861 --> 02:45:39.896
HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR TO

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:41.531
THE TAXPAYERS AND HOW WE ARE

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:43.300
MOST IMPORTANTLY DIRECTING IT

02:45:43.366 --> 02:45:45.669
TOWARDS EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS- I

02:45:45.735 --> 02:45:47.237
SEE IT'S GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A

02:45:47.304 --> 02:45:48.972
COUPLE OF THINGS HERE- AND ALL

02:45:49.039 --> 02:45:50.106
OF A PLACE MAKE A COMMENT

02:45:50.173 --> 02:45:51.408
RATHER THAN BEING REALLY SEEK

02:45:51.474 --> 02:45:53.209
OUT ANY ANY FEEDBACK- KNOWING

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:54.644
THAT THE AUTHOR AND HER TEAM

02:45:54.711 --> 02:45:56.012
ARE LISTENING CLOSELY AS THIS

02:45:56.079 --> 02:45:57.447
IS GOING FOR AND HAPPY TO MOVE

02:45:57.514 --> 02:45:59.449
THE BILL- AS WELL. MISTER BANKS

02:45:59.516 --> 02:46:01.184
HERE- FIRST OF ALL ON THE

02:46:01.251 --> 02:46:02.485
MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOMES CORNING

02:46:02.552 --> 02:46:04.187
FINANCING COUNCIL I KNOW THAT

02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:05.355
THERE ARE OTHER SPECIFIC

02:46:05.422 --> 02:46:06.923
DIRECTION TO UTILIZE MANY OF

02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:08.725
THE DIRECTORS OF THE DIFFERENT

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:09.859
AGENCIES I THINK I THINK IT'S

02:46:09.926 --> 02:46:10.860
IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE UPON THE

02:46:10.927 --> 02:46:12.462
MEMBERSHIP OF THEIR ANYONE BE

02:46:12.529 --> 02:46:18.301
SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW. FOR

02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:18.868
REPRESENTATIVES TO SOMETIMES

02:46:18.935 --> 02:46:19.536
DIRECTORS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:21.604
ON ACS. ALSO IS SUSPECT. ON

02:46:21.671 --> 02:46:23.006
THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT TO. THE

02:46:23.073 --> 02:46:24.441
ALLOCATED IN A CERTAIN WAY. I

02:46:24.507 --> 02:46:26.042
WOULD ENCOURAGE- I THINK

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.477
FURTHER SPECIFICATION TO

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:30.080
ENSHRINE AND ENSURE. THAT MOST

02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:31.915
OF THE FUNDING- IS REALLY

02:46:31.981 --> 02:46:34.284
DEDICATED TOWARDS HOUSING. OR

02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:35.585
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD REFERS TO

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:38.121
AS POSITIVE EXITS- SOMETIMES I

02:46:38.188 --> 02:46:40.423
THINK SOME BEER THAT- LOCAL

02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:42.125
GOVERNMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN

02:46:42.192 --> 02:46:43.827
TO ME NOT HAVING ACT TOGETHER-

02:46:43.893 --> 02:46:45.595
ARE USING THIS MONEY WITH. ALL

02:46:45.662 --> 02:46:47.530
GOOD INTENT- BUT DOESN'T

02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:48.431
ACTUALLY PRODUCE MANY THE

02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:49.733
OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT WE KNOW

02:46:49.799 --> 02:46:50.700
WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE

02:46:50.767 --> 02:46:51.735
INVESTMENTS AND HOUSING

02:46:51.801 --> 02:46:54.037
SOLUTIONS- SO THAT NOBODY AN

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:56.272
IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT- AND ALSO

02:46:56.339 --> 02:46:58.208
WRITTEN NOTE AS WELL THAT. I

02:46:58.274 --> 02:46:59.542
THINK THE BASELINE START TO RE

02:46:59.609 --> 02:47:02.345
USING FOR. A GOOD- A GOOD BASED

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:04.414
WEIGHT OF THIS IS ON THE TWENTY

02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:06.049
NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT- I

02:47:06.116 --> 02:47:08.218
WOULD CLAUSSEN. CONTINUING TO

02:47:08.284 --> 02:47:11.454
USE THAT FOR TWO REASONS ONE- I

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:12.522
THOUGHT THE ONLY METRIC OF HOW

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:13.556
WE MEASURE THE HOMELESS

02:47:13.623 --> 02:47:14.524
POPULATION THERE SO THERE MAY

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:15.892
BE OTHER WAYS. TO REALLY

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:17.794
IDENTIFY THE SCOPE IN THE

02:47:17.861 --> 02:47:18.862
MAGNITUDE OF THOSE EXPERIENCING

02:47:18.928 --> 02:47:20.597
HOMELESSNESS IN A GIVEN REGION.

02:47:20.663 --> 02:47:21.898
AND THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:23.166
OVER TIME HOPEFULLY IT WILL

02:47:23.233 --> 02:47:24.601
CHANGE. IN THE NEGATIVE

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:25.935
HOPEFULLY THAT NUMBER WILL GO

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:27.203
DOWN. AND I KNOW WE'VE SEEN

02:47:27.270 --> 02:47:28.772
THIS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET YEARS

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:29.906
WHERE WE'VE USED THE POINT IN

02:47:29.973 --> 02:47:31.474
TIME COUNT AS- A SINGULAR

02:47:31.541 --> 02:47:32.876
METRIC TO BE ABLE DECIDE WHO

02:47:32.942 --> 02:47:34.444
GETS WHAT. BUT IF THE AREA IS

02:47:34.511 --> 02:47:36.012
GOD'S ACT TOGETHER IF AN AREA

02:47:36.079 --> 02:47:37.914
IS IMPROVING. YOU WOULD EXPECT

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:39.048
TO SEE A REDUCTION IN

02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:39.682
HOMELESSNESS AND WE SHOULD NOT

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:42.218
PENALIZE. OUT REGIONS THAT HAVE

02:47:42.285 --> 02:47:43.319
THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND THAT ARE

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:44.821
ACTUALLY DOING THINGS RIGHT. WE

02:47:44.888 --> 02:47:45.822
SHOULD REWARD THOSE SAID LET'S

02:47:45.889 --> 02:47:47.857
JUST BE- I CONTINUE TO BE

02:47:47.924 --> 02:47:49.592
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE ARE-

02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:50.760
SORT OF BROAD BRUSHING. AND

02:47:50.827 --> 02:47:53.696
THE- DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS-

02:47:53.763 --> 02:47:55.198
NEXT ON PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES

02:47:55.265 --> 02:47:56.466
THESE ARE CRITICAL IN THIS IS

02:47:56.533 --> 02:47:57.634
ACTUALLY A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:59.135
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO

02:47:59.202 --> 02:48:00.103
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DEFINING

02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:02.038
THOSE. AND WE ARE HOLDING OUR

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:03.640
RECIPIENTS ACCOUNTABLE THOREZ-

02:48:03.706 --> 02:48:04.908
I REALLY LIKE WITH THIS BILL

02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:06.242
HAS AS IT. IS A GOOD STARTING

02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:07.811
POINT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

02:48:07.877 --> 02:48:09.245
AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:10.280
THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END

02:48:10.346 --> 02:48:11.414
HOMELESSNESS. IN THE UNITED

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:13.016
STATES IN REGENCY COUNCIL ON

02:48:13.082 --> 02:48:17.921
HOMELESSNESS. THEY'VE DONE A

02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:18.855
LOT OF DAVID INTERMENT STUDIES

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:19.689
ABOUT WHAT WE- BE MET- AND I

02:48:19.756 --> 02:48:20.523
THINK IT'S SHOULD BE REFER. IN

02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:22.826
POLICIES. I APPRECIATE THAT

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:24.461
THERE IS A STRONG REQUIREMENT-

02:48:24.527 --> 02:48:25.495
TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES AND

02:48:25.562 --> 02:48:27.497
COCS ARE APPLYING FOR FUNDING

02:48:27.564 --> 02:48:29.265
JOINTLY. COORDINATION IN A

02:48:29.332 --> 02:48:31.334
REGION IS EVERYTHING TOWARDS A

02:48:31.401 --> 02:48:32.902
SUCCESS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE.

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:34.637
AND HOMELESSNESS- I ALSO

02:48:34.704 --> 02:48:36.172
APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A

02:48:36.239 --> 02:48:37.273
PROVISION IN THIS BILL THAT'S

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:39.809
GOING TO BE- DIRECTING- DIETZ

02:48:39.876 --> 02:48:42.378
C. D. H. C. S. TO WORK ON

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:43.313
FEDERAL PROVE FROM MEDICAL

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:44.380
BENEFITS I THINK IT'S MONEY

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:45.949
WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE-

02:48:46.015 --> 02:48:46.883
THAT WE CAN BRING HERE TO

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:48.451
CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN THIS JUST

02:48:48.518 --> 02:48:49.385
ADDS I THINK THAT THE

02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:50.987
COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF WHY

02:48:51.054 --> 02:48:54.290
THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT AND SO-

02:48:54.357 --> 02:48:57.227
SO. IMPORTANT THAT THE

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:57.827
LEGISLATURE PASS AND THAT THE

02:48:57.894 --> 02:48:59.696
GOVERNOR SIGN. LASTLY ALL

02:48:59.762 --> 02:49:01.164
MENTION OF COURSE HOW WE PAY

02:49:01.231 --> 02:49:03.266
FOR IT- I. I THINK THAT THIS

02:49:03.333 --> 02:49:05.068
IS- IMPORTANT IN THE SCOPE THAT

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:06.736
WE'RE LOOKING AT. SOMETHING IN

02:49:06.803 --> 02:49:08.071
THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE I

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:08.872
THINK THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING

02:49:08.938 --> 02:49:11.007
CONVERSATION- I WOULD CAUTION

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:12.075
THE AUTHORED ABOUT USING

02:49:12.141 --> 02:49:13.943
SOMETHING THAT IS SO.

02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:15.411
SINGULARLY FOCUSED I THINK

02:49:15.478 --> 02:49:17.580
BECAUSE OF THE- NATURE OF WHAT

02:49:17.647 --> 02:49:18.448
WE'RE SEEING STATEWIDE THAT WE

02:49:18.515 --> 02:49:20.250
NEED TO LOOK AT- BROAD BASED

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:22.318
SOLUTIONS. AND IF WE'RE JUST

02:49:22.385 --> 02:49:24.120
LOOKING AT ONE PARTICULAR AREA.

02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:25.889
WHETHER IT'S NOT IN THIS CASE

02:49:25.955 --> 02:49:27.757
EIGHT TAX PROVISION THAT. IS

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:29.526
GOING TO IF I JUST CONVERSATION

02:49:29.592 --> 02:49:31.828
GOES FORWARD GOING TO INVITE-

02:49:31.895 --> 02:49:34.297
INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION-

02:49:34.364 --> 02:49:35.532
CHALLENGES I THINK WITH A LOT

02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:36.499
OF OUR MANY IMPORTANT

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:38.067
INDUSTRIES RIGHT NOW ABOUT.

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:39.669
POTENTIALLY PLACING COMPETITIVE

02:49:39.736 --> 02:49:41.938
DISADVANTAGES- FOR CALIFORNIA'S

02:49:42.005 --> 02:49:43.306
WORK WE'RE WE'RE THE WAY THESE

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:43.773
INDUSTRIES ARE HERE IN

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:46.309
CALIFORNIA- I THINK BROAD BI

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.378
SOLUTIONS ARE THE WAY TO GO SO

02:49:48.444 --> 02:49:49.112
I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD MOVE

02:49:49.178 --> 02:49:51.381
FORWARD IS. UP TO CONTINUE TO

02:49:51.447 --> 02:49:52.382
ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO LOOK

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:54.651
FOR. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN A

02:49:54.717 --> 02:49:56.085
WAY TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD AGAIN

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:57.453
NOT SHRINKING AS PIE BECAUSE WE

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.355
NEED BIG SOLUTIONS- BUT MAKE

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:00.557
SURE THAT IT'S BEING DRIVEN IN

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:02.559
A WAY- THAT IS NOT BROAD BASED

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:04.027

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:32.555
SPEND MANY HOURS NOT JUST TODAY

02:50:32.622 --> 02:50:35.992
BUT- THROUGHOUT THE WEEK SINCE

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:37.493
I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATIVE

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.062
BODY BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:40.396
THINKING ABOUT HOUSING AND

02:50:40.463 --> 02:50:42.231
HOMELESSNESS. I'VE BEEN

02:50:42.298 --> 02:50:45.001
AFFECTED PERSONALLY REGARDING

02:50:45.068 --> 02:50:47.804
HOMELESSNESS. AND THIS BILL

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:49.138
COVERS MANY MANY OF THE

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:50.673
CONCERNS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:52.775
THIS COMMITTEE. AS SOME OF YOU

02:50:52.842 --> 02:50:54.177
MIGHT KNOW WE HAVE TWENTY SIX

02:50:54.243 --> 02:50:55.411
BILLS TODAY REGARDING

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:58.648
HOMELESSNESS OR AND HOUSING-

02:50:58.715 --> 02:51:00.350
AND WE'VE HAD MANY BEFORE THIS

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:01.985
AND WILL HAVE MANY AFTER THIS

02:51:02.051 --> 02:51:05.188
BILL ONE DEAL CANNOT FIX WHAT

02:51:05.254 --> 02:51:08.691
IS BROKEN- FOCUSING ON A

02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:11.561
REVENUE. A STEADY SUSTAINABLE

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:14.664
REVENUE IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT.

02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:15.965
WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE

02:51:16.032 --> 02:51:17.467
REVENUES COMING INTO THE STATE

02:51:17.533 --> 02:51:19.769
THAT WE DID NOT COUNT ON

02:51:19.836 --> 02:51:21.871
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACTUALLY IN

02:51:21.938 --> 02:51:24.374
SURPLUS WE COULD SOLVE THIS

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.609
PROBLEM TODAY IF WE HAD THE

02:51:26.676 --> 02:51:28.745
WILL ANOTHER WILL IS TO LOOK AT

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:31.014
OUR BUDGET AND SAY HOW MANY

02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:33.116
THINGS CAN WE CUT. HOW MANY

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:34.951
THINGS CAN WE CROSS OUT HOW

02:51:35.018 --> 02:51:37.787
MANY THINGS CAN WE STREAMLINE.

02:51:37.854 --> 02:51:39.288
BEFORE WE GO BACK TO THE

02:51:39.355 --> 02:51:42.058
TAXPAYERS. AND ASK THEM TO PAY

02:51:42.125 --> 02:51:44.227
MORE TAXES IN THIS CASE IT'S

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:46.696
NOT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS. IT'S

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:51.634
ACTUALLY. CORPORATE TAX PAYERS.

02:51:51.701 --> 02:51:53.603
AND I'VE SAID MANY TIMES IN

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:55.905
ORDER FOR US TO HAVE GOOD JOBS

02:51:55.972 --> 02:51:57.774
WE HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYERS WE

02:51:57.840 --> 02:51:59.208
NEED EMPLOYERS AND THE

02:51:59.275 --> 02:52:01.944
EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT

02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:04.647
MIDDLE CLASS OPPORTUNITIES BUT

02:52:04.714 --> 02:52:06.249
WHEN WE CONTINUE TO MOVE

02:52:06.315 --> 02:52:09.585
TOWARDS ONE. ONE PART OF OUR

02:52:09.652 --> 02:52:12.522
GOVERNMENT TO. FUND ANOTHER

02:52:12.588 --> 02:52:14.691
PART WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:15.958
AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IS

02:52:16.025 --> 02:52:17.627
A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:19.996
LEAVING OUR STATE THE CENSUS

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:21.564
JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:23.332
YESTERDAY SAYING THAT. LOS

02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:25.168
ANGELES FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS

02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:27.870
NOT GROWN. BUT THIS IS NOT THE

02:52:27.937 --> 02:52:30.440
BURDEN OF BLAME MEAN WE HAVE

02:52:30.506 --> 02:52:32.608
VERY LOW HOUSING PRODUCTION WE

02:52:32.675 --> 02:52:35.244
KNOW LAST YEAR WE HAD MANY MANY

02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:37.413
HOUSING BILLS THAT WENT. NOT

02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:39.015
ONLY TO APPROPRIATIONS BUT EVEN

02:52:39.082 --> 02:52:40.216
TO THE GOVERNOR THAT WERE NOT

02:52:40.283 --> 02:52:42.618
SIGNED SO WE HAVE A PRODUCTION

02:52:42.685 --> 02:52:44.854
ISSUE. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF

02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:46.956
HOUSING WE HAVE MANY ISSUES IN

02:52:47.023 --> 02:52:48.825
THIS BILL IS A BILL THAT I

02:52:48.891 --> 02:52:50.693
THINK AS A BODY WE NEED TO MAKE

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.929
A PRIORITY AND REALLY MAP IT

02:52:52.995 --> 02:52:54.630
OUT BEFORE I CAN SUPPORT IT.

02:52:54.697 --> 02:52:56.099
THIS DOES NOT DISMISS THE

02:52:56.165 --> 02:52:58.134
AUTHORS GOOD WORK I HAVE A HIGH

02:52:58.201 --> 02:53:00.703

AFTER THIS THAT I'M GOING TO BE

02:53:03.306 --> 02:53:06.275
HAPPY TO SUPPORT. US AND IN NO

02:53:06.342 --> 02:53:08.444
WAY DOES IT DIMINISH THE IDEA

02:53:08.511 --> 02:53:09.579
THAT WE NEED TO STUDY FUNDING

02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:12.248
STREAM BUT AGAIN WHERE DOES

02:53:12.315 --> 02:53:14.851
THAT MONEY COME FROM. AND HOW

02:53:14.917 --> 02:53:17.420
CAN WE LOOK IN. THE BUDGET WE

02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:19.522
CURRENTLY HAVE WITHOUT LOOKING

02:53:19.589 --> 02:53:22.291
OUTSIDE TO TAX MORE SO TODAY I

02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:24.260
WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT I

02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:25.795
WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THIS

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:30.500

02:57:21.263 --> 02:57:22.798
ADMINISTRATION WHICH IT OFFERED

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:24.200
INCENTIVES FOR MULTINATIONAL

02:57:24.266 --> 02:57:26.202
CORPORATIONS TO SHIFT PROFITS

02:57:26.268 --> 02:57:28.771
OVERSEAS AND THEY'RE OPEN

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:29.939
TWENTY FOUR OTHER STATES THAT

02:57:30.006 --> 02:57:31.073
HAVE ALREADY CONFORMED AND I'LL

02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:32.274
JUST MENTION SOME OF THOSE

02:57:32.341 --> 02:57:34.610
STATES. ALABAMA ARIZONA NORTH

02:57:34.677 --> 02:57:37.680
DAKOTA IDAHO WEST VIRGINIA AND

02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:38.647
OTHER STATES THAT WOULD

02:57:38.714 --> 02:57:40.816
TYPICALLY BE CONSIDERED RED

02:57:40.883 --> 02:57:42.118
STATES MORE CNSERVATIVE

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:44.487
STATES- AND I WILL ALSO

02:57:44.553 --> 02:57:47.723
MENTION. THAT PART OF. A PART

02:57:47.790 --> 02:57:49.658
OF THIS CORPORATE TAX PART OF

02:57:49.725 --> 02:57:52.228
THIS TAX STRUCTURE- IT WOULDN'T

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:53.329
CREATE ANY COMPETITIVE

02:57:53.396 --> 02:57:54.964
DISADVANTAGE FOR STATE BECAUSE

02:57:55.031 --> 02:57:56.165
CORPORATIONS WOULD HAVE TO PAY

02:57:56.232 --> 02:57:57.133
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE

02:57:57.199 --> 02:57:58.134
LOCATED SO THE IDEA THAT

02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.835
SOMEHOW THIS IS DRIVING

02:57:59.902 --> 02:58:00.903
CORPORATIONS OUT OF STATE IF

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:02.104
THEY IF THEY GO. THEY'RE GOING

02:58:02.171 --> 02:58:04.306
TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME IMPACT-

02:58:04.373 --> 02:58:05.941
I DO YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:07.109
PERSPECTIVE THAT MAYBE WE

02:58:07.176 --> 02:58:08.110
SHOULD CONSIDER MORE BROAD

02:58:08.177 --> 02:58:10.613
BASED TAX I WILL SAY- THERE WAS

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:12.281
ANOTHER COMPONENT WHEN AB

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:13.849
SEVENTY ONE WAS FIRST PROPOSED.

02:58:13.916 --> 02:58:15.184
THAT WAS A MORE BROADLY BASED

02:58:15.251 --> 02:58:18.921
TAX- IT WAS BROAD AND BECAUSE

02:58:18.988 --> 02:58:20.056
IT WAS BROUGHT IT BROUGHT UP

02:58:20.122 --> 02:58:22.825
OPPOSITION I AND THAT PIECE GOT

02:58:22.892 --> 02:58:24.393
STRIPPED OUT IN THE RENDON TAX

02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:25.828
COMMITTEE SO. I THINK THERE IS

02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:28.097
A PERSPECTIVE- THAT AGAIN WE'RE

02:58:28.164 --> 02:58:29.298
TALKING ABOUT THE LARGEST

02:58:29.365 --> 02:58:31.434
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS-

02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:32.601
THAT HAVE ENGAGED AND REALLY

02:58:32.668 --> 02:58:33.803
FRANKLY A TAX AVOIDANCE

02:58:33.869 --> 02:58:35.304
STRATEGY AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE

02:58:35.371 --> 02:58:36.372
TRYING TO DO IS JUST RECOUP OUR

02:58:36.439 --> 02:58:38.607
FAIR SHARE AS A STATE- I'VE

02:58:38.674 --> 02:58:39.008
ALREADY MENTIONED

02:58:39.075 --> 02:58:40.342
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND I

02:58:40.409 --> 02:58:42.244
KNOW. THERE WAS SET AT LEAST ON

02:58:42.311 --> 02:58:43.813
THE OPPOSITION AND SOMEHOW THE

02:58:43.879 --> 02:58:45.181
SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE TO DO

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:46.682
MORE AS FAR AS PLANNING AROUND

02:58:46.749 --> 02:58:47.883
HOMELESSNESS THERE'S ANOTHER

02:58:47.950 --> 02:58:49.051
BILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:58:49.118 --> 02:58:50.453
VOTING ON WHICH IS MY ABILITY

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:51.921
TO SIXTEEN. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE

02:58:51.987 --> 02:58:53.122
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:58:53.189 --> 02:58:55.524
ESTABLISH EXACTLY THAT PLAN AND

02:58:55.591 --> 02:58:59.361
I THINK WE NEED TO DO. ALL

02:58:59.428 --> 02:58:59.962
THESE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME

02:59:00.029 --> 02:59:00.529
WOULD NEED TO BE LANDING WE

02:59:00.596 --> 02:59:04.300
NEED A- AND WE NEED. A A

02:59:04.366 --> 02:59:05.868
ONGOING SOURCE REVENUES IN OF

02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:07.903
THIS FORD SO WITH THAT. A VERY

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:09.305
HOPE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN

02:59:09.371 --> 02:59:11.073
MOVE THIS FORWARD. WE HAVE TO

02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:13.642
CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION-

02:59:13.709 --> 02:59:15.544
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH

02:59:15.611 --> 02:59:16.745
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THERE IS

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:19.415
GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS ONGOING

02:59:19.482 --> 02:59:21.984
NEED. AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:23.686
THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:24.753
CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY

02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:26.956
BOTH BEFORE COVERED AND AFTER

02:59:27.022 --> 02:59:28.224
COVERED THIS IS A MORAL CRISIS

02:59:28.290 --> 02:59:30.326
TODAY AND WITH THAT I

IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MORE ON

02:59:51.814 --> 02:59:53.015
PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGES FACING

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:55.017
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS

02:59:55.084 --> 02:59:57.386
IS AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE TO MOVE

FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THIS-

03:00:04.527 --> 03:00:05.194
I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S

03:00:05.261 --> 03:00:06.695
ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL THEIR NUMBER

03:00:06.762 --> 03:00:07.296

THAT IN ADDITION TO RESOURCES I

03:00:13.702 --> 03:00:14.403
THINK WE REALLY NEED TO THINK

03:00:14.470 --> 03:00:16.805
ABOUT STRATEGY- AND HOW WE ARE

03:00:16.872 --> 03:00:19.909
LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES- I. IN

03:00:19.975 --> 03:00:21.443
MY COMMUNITY THERE'S JUST SUCH

03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:22.611
EXTRAORDINARY FRUSTRATION ABOUT

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:23.579
THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON THIS

03:00:23.646 --> 03:00:25.181
ISSUE- AND WHEN I TALK TO

03:00:25.247 --> 03:00:26.382

TIME I LOOK OUTSIDE MY WINDOW

03:00:34.557 --> 03:00:35.491
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROBLEM IS

03:00:35.558 --> 03:00:36.258
GETTING WORSE IT IS

03:00:36.325 --> 03:00:37.326

ACCESS AND LONGER COMMUTES.

03:03:31.567 --> 03:03:33.202
EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT THE

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:03:34.636 --> 03:03:36.071

03:17:49.958 --> 03:17:51.926
BE UP A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:54.596
ACTUALLY A TEMPLATE. TEMPLATE

03:17:54.662 --> 03:17:55.697
FOR WHICH IN A JURISDICTION

03:17:55.763 --> 03:17:57.699
COULD TAKE WITH THE BLANK LINES

03:17:57.765 --> 03:17:59.634

03:17:59.701 --> 03:18:01.069
ENVIRONMENT THEIR SETTING

03:18:01.135 --> 03:18:02.604
WHETHER IT'S A BERMAN OR

WHETHER YOU'RE IN A RURAL

03:18:03.805 --> 03:18:05.673
SETTING- THIS IS JUST A

03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:08.176
TEMPLATE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED

03:18:08.243 --> 03:18:10.144
IT'S ACTUALLY THERE AS A TOOL

03:18:10.211 --> 03:18:15.250
IF THE. JURISDICTION SO CHOOSES

03:18:15.316 --> 03:18:15.850
TO USE IT. CORRECT THANK YOU

03:18:15.917 --> 03:18:17.585
VERY MUCH- SO YOU I MY BIGGER

03:18:17.652 --> 03:18:21.956
CONCERN- WITH THIS IS THAT- YOU

03:18:22.023 --> 03:18:25.627
KNOW. A LOT OF A LOT OF THESE

03:18:25.693 --> 03:18:28.963
NEXUS STUDIES I. D. PEOPLE WHO

03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:30.465
OPPOSE THEM AND GENERALLY IT'S

03:18:30.531 --> 03:18:32.100
ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE DEVELOPMENT

03:18:32.166 --> 03:18:33.835
INDUSTRY OPPOSES THEM I DON'T I

03:18:33.901 --> 03:18:36.070
DON'T BLAME THEM. IT RAISES THE

03:18:36.137 --> 03:18:37.205
COST FOR DOING DEVELOPMENT

03:18:37.272 --> 03:18:39.140
ACOSTA BUT IT THE END OF THE

03:18:39.207 --> 03:18:42.310
DAY. WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING

03:18:42.377 --> 03:18:44.512
TO HAPPEN IS THIS MASSIVE DROP

03:18:44.579 --> 03:18:45.780
BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY HAS

03:18:45.847 --> 03:18:47.415
INFLATED THOSE NEXT TO STUDY SO

03:18:47.482 --> 03:18:50.652
MUCH. AND PUT THOSE IMPACT FEES

03:18:50.718 --> 03:18:52.153
UP SUPER HIGH BECAUSE I THINK

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:53.288
IT'S LIKE DONE LIKE AND ****

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:55.790
NILLY PROCESS IT'S A VERY LONG

03:18:55.857 --> 03:18:58.326
PROCESS IT TAKES UP TO YEARS-

03:18:58.393 --> 03:19:00.528
TO DO THOSE. AND I DON'T THINK

03:19:00.595 --> 03:19:01.929
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE DROP

03:19:01.996 --> 03:19:03.197
THAT THEY THEY'RE HOPING TO

03:19:03.264 --> 03:19:05.600
SEE. AND TAKING AWAY THE LOCAL

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:08.870
VERY LOCAL CONTROL- IT IS A

03:19:08.936 --> 03:19:10.138
CONCERN BUT I KNOW IT IT'S

03:19:10.204 --> 03:19:12.473
OFFSET A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT

03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:13.775
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO. THOSE

03:19:13.841 --> 03:19:14.409

TEMPLATE THAT IS PROVIDED AS A

03:19:25.286 --> 03:19:29.691
CHOICE. AND THE FACT IS. WE

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND IT

03:43:53.286 --> 03:43:55.155

03:43:55.221 --> 03:43:57.157
WE MAYBE HAVE A SWEET SPOT-

03:43:57.223 --> 03:43:58.825
THIS BILL IS ALLOWING

03:43:58.892 --> 03:43:59.759
DEVELOPERS TO TAKE A MORE

03:43:59.826 --> 03:44:04.130
MARKET- DRIVEN APPROACH. TO THE

03:44:04.197 --> 03:44:05.198
WAY THAT HOUSING IS PUT

03:44:05.265 --> 03:44:07.133
TOGETHER A MANY CITIES PROP

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:08.868
ALMOST ALL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA

PROVIDE ON SITE PARKING SPACES

03:44:13.106 --> 03:44:14.641
IN THE AMOUNT OF THE REPAIRS IS

03:44:14.707 --> 03:44:16.142
PRETTY ARBITRARY AND IT VARIES

03:44:16.209 --> 03:44:17.811
ACROSS THE STATE APARTMENTS

03:44:17.877 --> 03:44:19.012

PROVIDE ONE SPACE FOR EVERYONE

03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:24.851
TO TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET.

03:44:24.918 --> 03:44:26.252
FREQUENTLY CAUSING MORE SPACE

03:44:26.319 --> 03:44:27.987
BE PROVIDED FOR PARKING AND FOR

03:44:28.054 --> 03:44:29.155
THE BUSINESS ITSELF AND THIS IS

03:44:29.222 --> 03:44:31.124
A FACTOID THAT I PICKED UP THAT

03:44:31.191 --> 03:44:32.392
I THINK IS REALLY SHOCKING

03:44:32.458 --> 03:44:34.427
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE DEVOTE

03:44:34.494 --> 03:44:36.196
APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND

03:44:36.262 --> 03:44:38.665
SQUARE FEET OF SPACE- OF SPACE

03:44:38.731 --> 03:44:39.833
FOR EVERY CAR THAT'S IN

03:44:39.899 --> 03:44:41.935
EXISTENCE BUT ONLY EIGHT

03:44:42.001 --> 03:44:43.403
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF HOUSING

FOR EVERY PERSON THAT LIVES IN

03:44:45.138 --> 03:44:46.906
THE UNITED STATES. SO IT SHOWS

03:44:46.973 --> 03:44:48.942
THAT OUR PRIORITIES IN MY MIND-

03:44:49.008 --> 03:44:51.411

ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATES THAT

03:44:53.346 --> 03:44:55.415

DEPENDENCE AND DISCOURAGES MASS

03:45:13.233 --> 03:45:15.034
TRANSIT USES INCREASING VEHICLE

03:45:15.101 --> 03:45:17.203
MILESTRAVELED IT'S ALSO ONE

03:45:17.270 --> 03:45:18.805
URBAN AREAS OF FAIR AND EVEN IN

03:45:18.872 --> 03:45:20.106
SUBURBAN A ROLLER IS OFTEN A

03:45:20.173 --> 03:45:21.541
VERY INEFFICIENT USE OF SPACE

03:45:21.608 --> 03:45:23.109
IT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO WALK

03:45:23.176 --> 03:45:25.111
FURTHER THEREFORE DRIVE FURTHER

03:45:25.178 --> 03:45:26.679

BY RAISING THE COST OF HOUSING

03:45:36.890 --> 03:45:38.992
PRODUCTION. ON AVERAGE A GARAGE

03:45:39.058 --> 03:45:41.628
COSTS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY

03:45:41.694 --> 03:45:42.262
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE

03:45:42.328 --> 03:45:44.097

WHETHER OR NOT THEY OWN A CAR.

03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:49.035
ADDITIONALLY ONSITE PARKING

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:50.103
TAKES UP SPACES THAT COULD

03:45:50.169 --> 03:45:50.970
OTHERWISE BE USED FOR

03:45:51.037 --> 03:45:52.839
ADDITIONAL PARKING UNITS. AND

03:45:52.906 --> 03:45:53.840
IT'S INSIDE THIS IS BILL I'VE

03:45:53.907 --> 03:45:55.375

KNOW PERSONALLY IN MY OWN CITY.

03:45:57.076 --> 03:45:58.444
WILL HAVE A HOUSE WHO WANTED TO

03:45:58.511 --> 03:46:00.246
PUT A COUPLE OF UNITS BEHIND IN

03:46:00.313 --> 03:46:01.948
THE MULTI FAMILY AREA BUT WE'RE

03:46:02.015 --> 03:46:02.882
TOLD THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY

03:46:02.949 --> 03:46:04.417
WOULD HAVE HAD TO ASK ADD SEVEN

03:46:04.484 --> 03:46:06.119
MORE PARKING SPACES. ON A SMALL

03:46:06.185 --> 03:46:07.287
LOT IN AN AREA WHERE THEY

03:46:07.353 --> 03:46:09.422
REALLY DIDN'T NEED THE PARKING.

03:46:09.489 --> 03:46:10.290
AB FORTINO ONE DOES NOT

03:46:10.356 --> 03:46:12.325
PROHIBIT DEVELOPERS FROM ADDING

03:46:12.392 --> 03:46:13.326
PARKING IN PLACES THAT HAVE

03:46:13.393 --> 03:46:14.794
DONE THIS LIKE BUFFALO NEW YORK

03:46:14.861 --> 03:46:16.930
AND SAN DIEGO. THE TRUTH IS A

03:46:16.996 --> 03:46:18.564
DEVELOPER STILL AT PARKING BUT

THE DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY'RE

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:22.135
PUTTING TOGETHER. AND IN

03:46:22.201 --> 03:46:23.503
BUFFALO WHAT THEY FOUND WAS

03:46:23.569 --> 03:46:26.172
THAT- MULTI THAT- DEVELOPERS

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:29.509
THAT WE'RE DOING MULTI USE-

03:46:29.575 --> 03:46:31.344
MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS WORK

03:46:31.411 --> 03:46:32.445
WITH EACH OTHER TO SHARE

03:46:32.512 --> 03:46:34.113
PARKING AND SE THAT SPACE A

03:46:34.180 --> 03:46:35.181
LOT MORE EFFICIENCY.

03:46:35.248 --> 03:46:36.983
EFFICIENTLY THE BILL CONTINUES

03:46:37.050 --> 03:46:39.452

DISABLED PARKING AND FOR

03:46:42.622 --> 03:46:44.390
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE MEASURE

03:46:44.457 --> 03:46:45.625
WOULD REDUCE CAR DEPENDENCE

03:46:45.692 --> 03:46:46.859
LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS AND

03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:48.995
ENCOURAGE MORE HOUSING BE BUILT

DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR

03:46:51.597 --> 03:46:52.598
LOWER COST IF THEY COULD THEN

03:46:52.665 --> 03:46:54.233
PASS ALONG TO RESIDENTS. SO

MINIMUMS ARE IN OUR DOWNTOWN

04:06:57.969 --> 04:06:59.638

THAT- IF YOU KNOW. THE FACT IS.

04:07:14.586 --> 04:07:16.054
THIS POLICY IS ENCOURAGE

04:07:16.121 --> 04:07:17.889
CARBAPENEMS HAS DISCOURAGED

04:07:17.956 --> 04:07:19.724
MASS TRANSIT HAS INCREASED

04:07:19.791 --> 04:07:21.493
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- IS

CRITICALLY WITH REGARDS TO.

04:07:34.105 --> 04:07:36.508
SOME OF OUR MOST MORE RECENT.

04:07:36.575 --> 04:07:38.143
DISCUSSIONS AROUND DENSITY

04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:41.246
BONUS LAW. AND THE TRADE OFFS

04:07:41.313 --> 04:07:42.214
THAT WE MADE BETWEEN AFFORDABLE

HOUSING AND PARKING FOR MY

04:07:43.715 --> 04:07:45.417
PERSPECTIVE IF WE CAN REWIND

04:07:45.483 --> 04:07:46.952
THE CLOCK I DON'T THINK. WE

04:07:47.018 --> 04:07:48.086
WOULD HAVE TIED SOME OF THESE

04:07:48.153 --> 04:07:49.154
PAST DENSITY BONUS AND

04:07:49.221 --> 04:07:50.956
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OBJECTIVE

04:07:51.022 --> 04:07:52.557
TO PARKING MINIMUMS BUT WE DID

04:07:52.624 --> 04:07:53.892
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE

04:07:53.959 --> 04:07:55.160

AND- IT AND KNOW IF THERE ARE

04:08:02.434 --> 04:08:03.401
GOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT COME

OUT OF THAT I LOOK FOR TO HEAR

04:08:04.636 --> 04:08:06.171
ABOUT IT- BUT AT THIS TIME I'M

04:08:06.238 --> 04:08:06.938
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

04:08:07.005 --> 04:08:09.074
MOVING FORWARD. AS IT CAME OUT

04:08:13.445 --> 04:08:14.446

NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF SPORTS

04:08:21.186 --> 04:08:23.088
PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT-

04:08:23.154 --> 04:08:26.391
IT'S GOOD- THANK ALL. I

04:08:26.458 --> 04:08:27.559
HONESTLY DON'T KNOW FOOTBALL

04:08:27.626 --> 04:08:29.060
THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PARKING

04:08:29.127 --> 04:08:31.663
OKAY SO. I YOU KNOW I REALLY DO

04:08:31.730 --> 04:08:33.098
APPRECIATE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

04:08:33.164 --> 04:08:33.798
WERE RAISED AND WE'VE BEEN

04:08:33.865 --> 04:08:35.000
THINKING FOR A LOT OF THESE AS

04:08:35.066 --> 04:08:36.301
WELL AND FROM THE ADVOCATES TO

04:08:36.368 --> 04:08:37.702
ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU

04:08:37.769 --> 04:08:38.970
KNOW ALL THIS A VERY QUICKLY

04:08:39.037 --> 04:08:40.005
THAT YOU KNOW CITIES ALSO HAVE

04:08:40.071 --> 04:08:41.306
A LOT OF TOOLS AT THEIR

04:08:41.373 --> 04:08:42.340
DISPOSAL TO DEAL WITH PARKING

04:08:42.407 --> 04:08:43.775
MANAGEMENT. HOW WE GOT RID OF A

04:08:43.842 --> 04:08:45.243
LOT OF THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS

04:08:45.310 --> 04:08:46.077
IN OUR DOWNTOWN IN GLENDALE

04:08:46.144 --> 04:08:47.679
BUILT A COUPLE STRUCTURES. AND

04:08:47.746 --> 04:08:48.647
ACTUALLY FORCED PEOPLE TO WALK

04:08:48.713 --> 04:08:49.714
AROUND THE DOWNTOWN IT WAS A

04:08:49.781 --> 04:08:51.650
HUGE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SHOPS.

04:08:51.716 --> 04:08:52.717
AND RUNNING MORE TRANSIT IS A

04:08:52.784 --> 04:08:54.552
GOAL AND I'M COMMITTED TO

04:08:54.619 --> 04:08:55.387
TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY TO ALL

04:08:55.453 --> 04:08:57.322
OF OUR CITIES- THROUGH MY ROLE

04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:58.757
OF TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT

04:08:58.823 --> 04:09:00.258
TRANSIT. SO I DO THINK THAT

04:09:00.325 --> 04:09:01.192
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS HERE BUT

04:09:01.259 --> 04:09:03.194
PUTTING IT ALL- THIS ONE SIZE

04:09:03.261 --> 04:09:04.963
FITS ALL AND DEVELOPERS IT'S

04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.697
SOMETHING THAT JUST ISN'T

04:09:05.764 --> 04:09:07.465
WORKING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DO

04:09:07.532 --> 04:09:08.033
KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER

04:09:08.099 --> 04:09:09.668
GENERATION. IS TAKING RIDE

04:09:09.734 --> 04:09:11.102
SHARE VEHICLES MORE AND A TON

04:09:11.169 --> 04:09:12.137
OF HIS VEHICLES I HAPPEN TO

04:09:12.203 --> 04:09:13.805
BELIEVE ARE JUST A NUMBER OF

04:09:13.872 --> 04:09:14.939
YEARS AWAY AND THEN WHAT ARE WE

04:09:15.006 --> 04:09:15.640
GONNA DO WITH ALL OF THESE

04:09:15.707 --> 04:09:17.609
GIANT EMPTY PARKING LOTS. NOT

04:09:17.676 --> 04:09:18.710
TO MENTION THAT MOST CITIES

04:09:18.777 --> 04:09:19.177
HAVEN'T DONE PARKING

04:09:19.244 --> 04:09:20.812
INVENTORIES AND THERE'S A LOT

04:09:20.879 --> 04:09:21.946
OF UNUSED PARKING BOTH

04:09:22.013 --> 04:09:23.415
COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL THAT

04:09:23.481 --> 04:09:24.616
CAN BE USED SO MUCH MORE

04:09:24.683 --> 04:09:26.551
CREATIVELY. I'M TO PARK PEOPLE

04:09:26.618 --> 04:09:27.886
SO I DO APPRECIATE THE

04:09:27.952 --> 04:09:28.987
DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE TO

04:09:29.054 --> 04:09:29.821
WORK WITH ALL OF THE

04:09:29.888 --> 04:09:31.656
STAKEHOLDERS AND WESTERN CENTER

04:09:31.723 --> 04:09:32.290
AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND WITH

04:09:32.357 --> 04:09:33.992
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEIR

04:09:34.059 --> 04:09:36.061
CONCERNS. I DO FIND IT A LITTLE

04:09:36.127 --> 04:09:37.696
IRONIC. TO SAY WE'RE REQUIRING

04:09:37.762 --> 04:09:38.763
MORE PARKING AND WE KNOW WE

04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:40.165
NEED SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO

04:09:40.231 --> 04:09:41.566
BARGAIN SOMETHING AND GIVE IT

04:09:41.633 --> 04:09:43.535
BACK- I THINK IT RATED ITS FACE

04:09:43.601 --> 04:09:44.436
THERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF WRONG

04:09:44.502 --> 04:09:46.237
WITH THAT. AND I WILL ALSO SAY

04:09:46.304 --> 04:09:47.572
THAT MOST DEVELOPERS OF FROM

04:09:47.639 --> 04:09:49.074
WHAT I'VE BEEN LEARNING TAKE

04:09:49.140 --> 04:09:50.542
THE PARKING PRODUCTION ONLY TO

04:09:50.608 --> 04:09:52.243
SERVICE. THAT HIGHER DENSITY

04:09:52.310 --> 04:09:53.745
THAT THEY'RE GETTING SO IT'S

04:09:53.812 --> 04:09:54.746
JUST BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GETTING

04:09:54.813 --> 04:09:55.680
THAT HIGHER DENSITY YOU NEED

04:09:55.747 --> 04:09:57.315
THE REDUCTION OTHERWISE YOU

04:09:57.382 --> 04:09:57.882
HAVE TO ADD SO MUCH PARKING

04:09:57.949 --> 04:09:59.250
THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. BUT

04:09:59.317 --> 04:10:00.218
WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE

04:10:00.285 --> 04:10:01.920
