WE HAVE ELEVEN BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA- BEFORE YOUR PRESENTATION ON THOSE BILLS WITH THAT WAS A QUORUM- CONSULTANT ASK YOU TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR PURCHASING YOUR COURTESY HERE ARE TWELVE OAK. THE RUSSELL. THERE BLAIR HERE NEWMAN YOUR NO MAN HERE WE HAVE A CORE CONSOLE NOTES SO THE QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO KNOW WHEN WE HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR SAWSAN EARLY THE COMMAND WELCOME- AND IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL SB NINE THIRTY ONE. TH TH. YOU GUYS HEAR ME NOW WE CAN SEE THAT THAT HELP TO TURN MY COAT EVERYTHING IS VERY LOW FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE TALL. SO GOOD AFTERNOON I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT S. B. NINE THIRTY ONE- WHEN I WAS ELECTED EIGHT YEARS AGO I WAS TOLD DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR BILLS. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL. SB NINE THIRTY ONE IMPOSES PENALTIES ON PUBLIC EMPLOYERS FOR UNLAWFULLY ATTEMPTING TO DETER OR DISCOURAGE EMPLOYEES. FROM JOINING OR PARTICIPATING IN A UNION. WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE ALREADY MADE CLEAR THE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM DETERRING UNION MEMBERSHIP BY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. AND APPLICANTS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS ARE AUTHORIZED TO BRING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES YOU WELL PEAS. AT THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BOARD HERB FOR EXACTLY THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR. UNFORTUNATELY IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS HAVE REPEATEDLY SENT OUT ANTI UNION COMMUNICATIONS. TO EXISTING BARGAINING UNITS OR WORKERS ATTEMPTING TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. BUT AN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION SUCCEEDS IN PETITIONING PERK TO GRANT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE HER CAN ONLY ISSUE A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. REQUIRING THE EMPLOYER TO POST NOTICE OF THE VIOLATION. BY THE TIME OF THE NOTICE THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE DETERRED UNDETERRED FROM BREAKING THE LAW AND WILL CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THEIR EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO ORGANIZE UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE ACTS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES. S. B. NINE THIRTY ONE WILL IMPOSE A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY PER VIOLATION PER AFFECTED EMPLOYEE NOT TO EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. BY CREATING A FINANCIAL PENALTY PENALTY FOR VIOLATING SECTION THREE FIVE FIVE ZERO OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE EMPLOYERS WILL HOPEFULLY THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE INTENTIONALLY DISCOURAGING UNION ACTIVITY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WITH ME TODAY TOO SURE EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED OUR MAP ROAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND CHRISTOPHER MAHER WITH ASKED ME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE- THANK YOU SENATOR I WILL TURN TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS. NUMBER ONE MAP ROAD IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO MAKE A LIST OF THEM HERE ARE YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YES ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT BROUGHT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL. WE'RE AT PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB NINE THIRTY ONE WHICH AS SENATOR LEYVA SAID CREATES ROBUST PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF GOV CODE THIRTY FIVE FIFTY. WHICH PREVENTS PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYERS FROM DETERRING OR DISCOURAGING UNION ORGANIZING ACTIVITY. THE LEGISLATURE SPOKE LOUDLY AND DECISIVELY FOLLOWING THE TWENTY NINETEEN U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISION AND JANICE WHEN HE DECLARED THE POLICY OF CALIFORNIA IS THE NECESSITATE. LABOR NEUTRALITY ON THE PART OF PUBLIC EMPLOYERS UNFORTUNATELY CINCINNATI WHEN A SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY WE'VE SEEN CERTAIN PUBLIC EMPLOYERS REPEATEDLY BREAK THE LAW WITH LITTLE TO NO RECOURSE. IN FACT JUST LAST WEEK PROVING ENDED DOWN A DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE TEAMSTERS WITH RESPECT AT THIRTY FIVE FIFTY VIOLATION AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. DURING AN ORGANIZING CAMPAIGN THE DISK AND CAME CLOSE TO THREE YEARS AFTER THE COMMUNICATION AND THE ONLY REMEDY WAS FOR THE EMPLOYER TO POST A CEASE AND DESIST NOTICE. ALL THOSE TAKE YEARS TO LITIGATE WAS EXTREMELY COSTLY TO THE UNION THE DAMAGE WAS DONE THE MINUTE THE COMMUNICATION TOOK PLACE. S. B. NINE THIRTY ONE WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS REMEDYING THIS WHOLE AN EXISTING LAW. BY CREATING A SUBSTANTIAL PENALTY RECOVERABLE DIPPER PUBLIC EMPLOYERS WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE MAKING BUSTING A CON A CONSCIOUS PART OF THEIR LABOR RELATIONS STRATEGY AND OF COURSE THERE IS ZERO PENALTY FOR COMPLYING WITH EXISTING LAW. WITH THAT I WOULD URGE. YOUR EYES THAT NIKKI FOR THE CONSIDERATION. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER. NEXT TO. IN SUPPORT. CHRISTOPHER MAHER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KRISTOFF MEYER AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES WE LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF MR BRAUN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS ASSAMESE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WITH EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE REPEATEDLY INTERFERED WITH ORGANIZING EFFORTS AND REMAINED UNDETERRED BY THESE CONSEQUENCES WIN TO DISRUPT THE ATTEMPTS TO UNIONIZE EVEN IF THE EMPLOYER HAS TO SPEND TIME AND RESOURCES DISPUTING A VIOLATION OF SECTION THIRTY FIVE FIFTY. JUST LAST MONTH MANAGERIAL STAFF AT UCSF TOLD NEW EMPLOYEES OUT RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT JOIN THE UNION BECAUSE THE MANAGER SAID THE UNION WOULD TAKE THE EMPLOYEES MONEY AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEM. PLEASE JOIN US IN SUPPORT OF THIS. IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MOORE IN TO APOLOGIZE TO BOTH LEAD.

YOU SEE HAS REQUESTED AMENDMENTS TO AWARD ATTORNEYS FEES TO EITHER PREVAILING PARTY. AND ALSO AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE COUNTIES IN THE BILL ON THE FLY THE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS MASS COMMUNICATIONS AS DEFINED. IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THREE FIVE FIVE THREE. MASS COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDE ANY KIND OF WRITTEN VERBAL RECORDED OR OTHER MESSAGE INTENDED FOR EMPLOYEES- FULL FULL OF FLEAS. HELLO REQUIRES PUBLIC EMPLOYERS LIKE TO SEE MEET AND CONFER PRIOR TO SENDING OUT THOSE MESSAGES. IF PARTIES CANNOT AGREE ON THE CONTENT THE EMPLOYER MUST BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE A MESSAGE FROM THE UNION AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME WAY ON A RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF THE DETERRENT DISCOURAGE CODE SECTION HAVE THUS FAR ONLY CONSIDER THE FACT MANY CASES THAT TRUST ME I WOULD ALWAYS BE SO. AND SENATE BILL NINE THIRTY ONE WOULD ADD A NEW PENALTY AUTHORITY THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. WITHOUT VERIFICATION AS POSSIBLE EVERY U. LP FILED WILL INCLUDE AN ALLEGATION THAT THE UNDERLYING CLAIM ITSELF WAS DETERRING OR DISCOURAGING. IT'S pNOT UNREASONABLE TO IMAGINE THAT EVERY CONTRACT DISPUTE OR BARGAINING IMPASSE WOULD BRING OUT WAR P. POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO PENALTIES. THERE IS A NATURAL TENSION BETWEEN LABOR AND MANAGEMENT BUT NOT EVERY DISAGREEMENT. SHOULD RESULT IN PENALTIES. PENALTIES THAT TAKE PUBLIC FUNDS INTENDED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. AND THEN GIVE THEM TO A DIFFERENT PUBLIC EMPLOYER WITH A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. THESE REASONS YOU SEE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE SENATE BILL NINE THIRTY ONE UNLESS IT IS AMENDED. MORE CLEARLY DEFINED WHAT CONSTITUTES A DETERRING OR DISCOURAGING UNION MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON THAT UNTIL NINE THIRTY.

YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUNNING VERTICALLY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. WE SHARE THE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION AND ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR WILL BRING UP BRING IT BACK WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION OF ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME YES- VICE CHAIR HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE OTHER. THREE LEAVE A- WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR AND- NUMBER ONE. USUALLY WE PROVIDE A CHANCE FOR AN ENTITY TO CURE- A MISTAKE BEFORE WE IMPOSE FINES AND PENALTIES. MADOC ADVOCATE FOR THAT BUT IN THIS CASE IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE IS ANY CHANCE FOR PUBLIC- FOR THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO FIX A PROBLEM BEFORE- IT IS AN ISSUE WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO INCLUDING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE. THE UNION MUST MEET AND CONFER BEFORE FILING THIS CHARGE WILL PROVIDE DISCRETION TO PERMIT SO THAT THEY CAN ISSUE A WARNING. THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A RIGHT HERE- AND IN THIS CASE IF THERE WAS A RIGHT TO CURE THE DAMAGE WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN DONE. BECAUSE ONCE A AN EMPLOYER HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF- DO YOU ANTI UNION- RHETORIC OR ANTI UNION- SPEECH OR PAPERWORK OR POSTINGS OR MEETINGS WITH TEIR EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT LAW SAYS IS THAT THEY JUST HAVE TO POST INTO A CEASE AND DESIST. MANY TIMES IT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THAT SEASON THIS IS THE MAIN PURPOSE EVEN PUT UP AND THE PROBLEM IS THE DAMAGE IS DONE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PENALTY. SO THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT INFRINGING ON WORKERS RIGHT TO FORM A UNION UP WORKERS FEDERAL RIGHT TO FORM. SO WOULD YOU MIND EDUCATING ME BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING OF THIS SORT WHICH IS THE CURRENT PROCESS ON THAT AND- IT GOES TO PERM. AND THEN PERMANENT A RULING OR FINDINGS AND THEN IF THEY ARE FOUND THE EMPLOYER IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN THEN THEY POST A CEASE AND DESIST USUALLY IN THE EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM BUT THAT CAN TAKE MANY MANY MONTHS AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. THE EMPLOYEE HE HAS ALREADY HEARD ALL OF THE RHETORIC AND ALL OF THE ANTI UNIONS FEEL SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PUT IN A PENALTY TO KEEP EMPLOYERS FROM DOING THAT. OKAY AND THEN NUMBER TWO I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH HOW THESE SIGNIFICANT FINES MAY AFFECT THE SOLVENCY OF OUR OF THE EMPLOYERS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO REQUIRING THAT PERSON THROUGH AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO PAY- AND THE SIZE OF THEIR GENERAL FUND BEFORE SIGNING A PENALTY NO IT IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE AND QUITE- QUITE IT'S JUST REALLY EASY DON'T ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITY AND THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO PAY THE FINE. THANK YOU WELCOME. OKAY THANK YOU BYE SURE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM FROM OTHER MEMBERS PRESENT ON SCENE NONE- THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE FIRST REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE I'M SORRY YES THAT'S RIGHT A NEW PASSPORT FIRST REFERRED THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY ON THE US.

EMPLOYEES HAVE THE FEDERAL RIGHT TO FORM A UNION EMPLOYERS DO NOT HAVE THE INHERENT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE AN EMPLOYEE FROM JOINING A UNION THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY DISCOURAGE EMPLOYERS FROM DOING THE WRONG THING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE UNDER IS NOT ONE OF THE MOTION BY SENATOR NEWMAN AND NOW US- THE CONSULTANT TO CALL THE ROLL PLEASE.

SO- I'M SURE SOME OF US ARE ARE SO PROUD TO BE HERE. RIGHT YOU'RE PROUD OF WE MIGHT REALLY. WELL I'M I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE RIGHT AND TODAY I PRESENT A SENATE BILL NINE FIFTY FOUR. TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO ESTABLISH A DATABASE OF ELECTRONIC CERTIFIED PAPER RECORDS THAT IS ACCESSIBLE. TO BOTH MULTI EMPLOYER HAVE HARDLY TRUST FUNDS AND OR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES. ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL LABOR MANAGEMENT CORPORATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. IN INSTANCES WHEN THE TAP HARD TO TRUST AND OR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES REQUEST PAPER RECORDS EXISTING LAW AUTHORIZES THE RELEASE OF THESE DOCUMENTS IN A LESS RESTRICTIVE MANNER REQUIRING THAT AWARDING BODIES AND LABOR STANDARDS INCLUDE ALL EMPLOYEES INFORMATION EXCEPT. FOR THE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. FOLLOWING A COMPLAINT CURRENT PRACTICE REQUIRES THE INITIATION OF A FORMER PUBLIC WORKS INVESTIGATION WHERE THE ASSIGNED DEPUTY MUST PERFORM A VARIETY OF VEGETATIVE TASK INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RESEARCH DOCKING MAILING INITIAL FORMS AND ALL PARTIES AND TO ALL PARTIES AND SETTING UP A PHYSICAL CASE LOAD AND FILES. OFTEN THESE CASES ARE CLOSED WITH NO VIOLATIONS FOUND BECAUSE THE CONTRACTOR FOLLOW THE LAW BY PROVIDING THE RECORDS TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ON A SET A STATUTORILY REQUIRED DEADLINES. THIS WASTE EFFORT RESOURCES AND TIME AND MONEY THAT COULD BE USED TO COMBAT VIOLATIONS THAT ARE MORE SERIOUS. BECAUSE OF THIS SENATE BILL NINE FIFTY FOUR IS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR THE RELEASE OF PUBLIC WORKS RECORDS IN PAPER RECORDS BY ESTABLISHING A STANDALONE THE DATABASE TO BE EXCESSIVE ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY TAFT HARTLEY TRUST FUNDS AND OR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE WE WILL. BE AT WILL BE ENABLING A MORE EFFICIENT FORM OF RECORD ACCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO INCREASED LABOR COMPLIANCE STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO CALCULATE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY DECREASING WORKLOAD OF AWARDING AGENCIES AND THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS AND ENFORCEMENT. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL IS MATT AGREEMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS AND WHO IS ALSO ABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE HEAVY DUTY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

AS A SENATOR STATED SP NINE FIFTY FOUR IS INTENDED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH JOINTLY BY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES IN TAFT HARTLEY TRUST FUNDS RECEIVE ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC CERTIFIED PAYROLL ON PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS- IT'SEXTREMELY IMPORTANT- RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT BOTH OF THESE ENTITIES ARE ENTITLED COPIES OF THESE RECORDS UNDER EXISTING LAW. ADDITIONALLY EXISTING LAW FROM LAST YEAR ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO A B. TEN TWENTY THREE BY SEVEN MEMBER HE FLORA. MANDATED THAT ALL CONTRACTORS ON PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS MUST PROVIDE ELECTRONIC CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. AND THE BILL ADDITIONALLY MADE IT SO THERE WAS A PENALTY FOR CONTRACTORS TO RELATE ON THIS REQUIREMENT. SO WITH THAT IN MIND AND CONSIDERING THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL NOW HAVE THESE RECORDS IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. S. B. NINE FIFTY FOUR WOULD SEEK TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH JHELUM SEASON TAFT HARTLEY TRUST RECEIVE ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS. I'M AGAIN WE ARE NOT CREATING ANY ANY NEW ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS ANY OUTSIDE ENTITIES AND WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS ON CONTRACTORS TO PROVIDE THESE RECORDS WE'RE SIMPLY LOOKING TO STREAMLINE THE EXISTING PROCESS THAT THESE ENTITIES USED TO GET IT.

ONE ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF SENATOR ATKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR KERRY YOU LIKE TO RECEIVE. THANK YOU- MEMBERS- EMENTA BY SECURITY MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN BEHALF APPROACH AMERICANS WHICH WILL PROVE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM FOR INJURED PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS SO THEY MAY ACCESS THE CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE AND DESERVE- IN IN OF COURSE TO CONTINUE PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY EACH AND EVERY DAY THE REPORT TO DUTY. TO PROTECT THESE WORKERS A LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTIONS IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM TO STREAMLINE CERTAIN CLAIMS REDUCE FRICTIONAL COSTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. THIRD EXPEDITIOUS ADJUDICATION OF THESE CLAIMS BENEFITS THE WORKERS SEEKING TREATMENT AND THEIR EMPLOYERS SAVING ADDITIONAL PERSONAL COST TO BACKFILL THE INJURED FIREFIGHTER. MINIMUM SALARY REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS MEANS EACH DAY OF FIREFIGHTERS OUT WITH AN INJURY OR ILLNESS ANOTHER FIREFIGHTER MUST COVER HIS OR HER SHIFT. OFTEN RESULTING IN OVERTIME TO BACKFILL THE INJURED FIREFIGHTER GROSSLY. TODAY INJURED WORKERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DELAYS AND DENIALS THAT PREVENT THEIR CLAIMS AND ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE FOR MOVING FORWARD IN A TIMELY MANNER. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN REDUCES THE TIME LINE FOR ACCEPTANCE OR DENIAL OF INJURY CLAIMS. PRESUMPTIVE OR OTHERWISE AND IT JUST PENALTIES FOR EMPLOYERS INSURERS AND THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS. THAT UNREASONABLY DENIED. PRESUMPTIVE INJURY CLAIMS S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN IT SURE IS A TEMPORARY DISABILITY AWARDED FOR CANCER CLAIM IS ADEQUATE. TO PROTECT THE INJURED FIREFIGHTER OVERTIME. AS HE BATTLED THEIR ILLNESS BY REMOVING THE STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR CANCER CLEANS AND BY ALLOWING UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY COMPENSABLE WEEKS FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM OCCUPATIONAL CANCER. WHERE THE CANCER. HAS CAUSED A TEMPORARY DISABILITY. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHIC WALL FIGHTERS PLAYERS THAT HAVE TAKEN A HUGE TOLL ON FIREFIGHTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FOURTEEN OF THE LARGEST TWENTY WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY FOUR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST TEN YEARS CAUSING TENS OF BILLIONS IN INSURANCE PAYOUTS AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE. URBAN RURAL FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE DEVASTATION OF HOMES AND TOWNS HUMAN SUFFERING AND TRAUMA THE INTEREST CONDITIONS AND EXTREME FATIGUE. THIS IS OUR NEW NORMAL BEING CALLED UPON TO UPDATE THIS IMPORTANT ONE OR TO PROTECT FRONTLINE HEROES. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FAIR AND REAL POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THOSE. WHO PROTECT US EACH AND EVERY DAY. WITH ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL. IN PERSON IS BRIAN RICE PRESENT. THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THE SPONSORS OF SB. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN. IN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK REGARDING SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN MY NAME'S BRIAN RICE AND THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THEY REPRESENT MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE TO THANK SENATOR CORTEZ C. AND SENATOR PRO TEM ATKINS AND ALL THE CO AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIVE'S EARNING VALUABLE PROTECTION FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER WORKERS WHOSE JOBS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND COME WITH MORE PERSONAL RISK RIGHT NOW FIREFIGHTERS ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THAT IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT WHEN DEALING WITH THE PRESUMPTIVE INJURY OR ILLNESS. IT'S MORE COMMON NOW FOR AN EMPLOYER THEIR INSURER OR THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TO INITIALLY DIDN'T DENY A PRESUMPTIVE CLAIM FACING NO MATERIAL RISK. OF INCURRING PENALTIES IF THE CLAIM IS ULTIMATELY ACCEPTED. INJURED FIREFIGHTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CARRYING THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL COST OF UNREASONABLE DENIALS. AND THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO SPEND THEIR TIME FIGHTING THEIR ILLNESS AND THE SYSTEM AND TO WHAT END. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THESE UNFAIR PRACTICES BY REFORMING THE PENALTY STRUCTURES AND TIMELINES REGARDING THE TERMINATION THE DETERMINATION FOR COMPENSATE ABILITY. BY INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR AN ACTION DEEMED BY A JUDGE TO BE UNEXPLAINED AND REASONABLE DENIAL OF PRESUMPTIVE BENEFITS. LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST SP TWENTY SEVEN WILL ENSURE THAT FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE A REOCCURRING CANCER DO NOT HAVE TO RESET THE CLOCK FOR TEMPORARY DISABILITY PROTECTIONS TO RUN OUT. YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT PROVISION FROM SAN FRANCISCO FIRE LIEUTENANT CD. NOW THE OPPOSITION MAY CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE REVIEWED THE DATA AND THEY'RE NOT PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THE SYSTEM IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY CAN I PERSONALLY NAME MORE FIREFIGHTERS THAN I CARE TO COUNT WHO'VE BEEN FIGHTING. BUT THEIR DENIALS OVER WORK COMP CLAIMS FOR WELL WELL OVER A YEAR MOREOVER IF THESE PARTIES ARE REASONABLY DENYING CLAIMS THEN WHY ARE THERE CONCERNS BEING RAISED ABOUT THE PENALTY PROVISIONS. THE LIKELY ALSO SAY THAT NINETY DAYS IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO PROCESS THESE CLAIMS AND PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS ARE ALL GRANTED ANYWAY. IF THAT WAS THE CASE WHY IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE FOR THESE CASES TO BE LEFT TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE OF A FIREFIGHTER. WHO HAS DIED OF JOB RELATED ILLNESS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SETTLED WHY THEY WERE STILL ALIVE. GIVEN TECHNOL TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEED UP CONSIDERATION OF COMPENSATE ABILITY AND S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WAS SURE THAT. THE STATUS QUO CANNOT CONTINUE. CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE BEING ABANDONED ALL FIREFIGHTERS WANT TO DO IN IT IF YOU ASK THEM. EVERY FIREFIGHTER I'VE EVER KNOWN THAT'S BEEN INJURED OR ILL. YEAH SOMEONE QUESTION IN ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE BEEN INJURED THE FIRST THING THEY ASK YOU IS WHEN CAN I GO BACK TO WORK. I SPOKE TO. A WORKERS COMP ATTORNEY THAT WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THIS DEADLY PHOENIX TWENTY FOUR OF THE TWENTY EIGHT PRESUMPTIVE. ILLNESS CASES THAT HE HOLDS OR OVER A YEAR OLD IN DENIAL. THERE IS A PROBLEM AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I'LL TAKE THIS FROM SENATOR LEYVA WHO IS JUST IN HERE. IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE DON'T GO OVER THE TIME LINE AND DON'T GET FINED. WE NEED YOUR HELP I STRONGLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS SP ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THROUGH THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ALSO HAVE A IT IS HERE RAISED RICE I'M SORRY LIEUTENANT MY GUY LISA SIDE SADIE.

MY NAME IS LUKE ALWAYS AT AND I AM A TWENTY THREE YEAR VETERAN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT.

I WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DURING A ROUTINE MAMMOGRAM SCREENING. DURING MY INITIAL PERIOD OF TREATMENT MY FOCUS WAS ON MY HEALTH AND MY FAMILY AND MAKING SURE THAT I CAN GET BACK TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I USE THE TEMPORARY DISABILITY TIME THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME TO SEEK TREATMENT AND AFTER SUCCESSFUL IMPACT IN THE PROCEDURES AND RADIATION. I WAS DECLARED CANCER FREE. AFTER A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH FOR FOUR YEARS I WAS UNFORTUNATELY FOUND TO HAVE BREAST CANCER ONCE AGAIN. IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SPREAD MY CANCER MEANT THAT THIS TIME I WOULD NEED A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. IT WAS DURING MY SECOND BOUT WITH CANCER THAT I WAS INFORMED THAT MY- TEMPORARY DISABILITY TIME HAD EXPIRED. SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS POSSIBLE AND THAT ADDED ADDITIONAL STRESS AND UNCERTAINTY TO AN ALREADY DIFFICULT TIME. BECAUSE THIS CANCER WAS DETERMINED TO BE A QUOTE UNQUOTE REOCCURRENCE. OF THE PREVIOUS BREAST CANCER I COULDN'T FILE FOR ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY DISABILITY LEAVING ME WITHOUT OPTIONS OTHER THAN TO USE MY OWN VACATION AND MY OWN THICK TURN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD. THE SURGERY AND HEALING TIME FOR A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY IS EXPENSIVE AND IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF MY MANY YEARS ON THE JOB AND CAREFULLY SAVING MYTIME. THAT I WAS ABLE TO COVER IT ALL. ANOTHER FIREFIGHTER MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY I HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. BUT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THEIR DISABILITY TIME. WHILE BATTLING CANCER. AS FIREFIGHTERS WE ARE EXPOSED TO ALL KINDS OF TOXIC MATERIALS. THAT ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE THE RISK OF CANCER. BUT WE FACE AS WELL ANYWAY BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR JOBS. AND SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO FOCUS. ON GETTING BETTER WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY WILL BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SICK. AGAIN WITHIN THE TIME THE RIGHT TIME FRAME OR WHETHER THEY WILL BE LEFT. WITH NO RECOURSE IF IT'S TOO LATE FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND KIND.

WHICH IS YOUR MCALLISTER I SUPPORT THIS BILL. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FROM THE OPPOSITION- DO WE HAVE ANY LEAD WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. S. ONE THREE. OKAY THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE- TO LEAD OFFICE AT WHICH IS NOT POSITION WILL BEGIN WITH FAITH LANE GORGEOUS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES PLEASE PROCEED MISFORTUNES. S. WHICH PLACES WITHOUT OKAY WITH THAT'S OKAY NO PROBLEM ARE YOU MISTER JAMES MR YES NOTHING ELSE SIR YEAH- WITH CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPOSITION OF PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT PERFECT THIS RECEIPT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- J. CENTRAL TO HEAR ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PRISM PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT WHICH IS A GPA THAT DOESN'T TURN SERVICES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- FEW THINGS TO KNOW RIGHT OFF- RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING THAT I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND. AS I'M AS I'M TALKING ONE THE BILL DOESN'T APPLY ONLY TO FIREFIGHTERS IN PEACE OFFICERS IT DOESN'T. APPLY ONLY TO PRESUMPTION CLAIMS AT A PRICE THAT APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS IN VARIOUS PROVISIONS CERTAIN pCLAIMS. BUT IT IS NOT A NEARLY A FIREFIGHTER PEACE OFFICER BILL. SO I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE PROVISION THAT REDUCES THE TIME FRAME- THE SPONSOR IS CORRECT- I MEAN MESSAGE TODAY IS GOING TO BE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME AFFORDED BY THE BILL. SO A FEW THINGS FOR YOU TO KEEP IN MIND- THIS BILL WAS STUDIED- THE PRECURSOR BILL WAS STUDIED- SP THREE THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR- SI WCI THE CALIFORNIA. WORKERS COMPENSATION INSTITUTE DID A BRIEF. PERCENT OF CLAIMS ROUGHLY- ACCEPTED WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS CURRENTLY- BY DAY NINETY. 97% OF CLAIMS ARE ACCEPTED SO THERE ARE SOME THAT GO BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS USUALLY. I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS IN A MINUTE IT'S A RESULT OF THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERTAKE- YOU REDUCE THAT TO FORTY FIVE DAYS AND- ONLY 84% OF CLAIMS- HAVE A- HAVE A DECISION. BUT THAT'S FOR ALL CLAIMS IF YOU LOOK AT CLAIMS ARE TONIGHT WHICH ARE DENIED- AT FORTY FIVE DAYS ONLY 37% OF THEM HAVE A DECISION THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND THIS IS FOR A REASON. I'M ONE OF THE CLAIMS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE TONIGHT OR PROBABLY THE MORE COMPLEX CLAIMS. OF MEDICALLY AND FACTUALLY OKAY SO WE HAVE TO DO AN ACTUAL INVESTIGATION- THAT IS DETAILED IN NATURE. AND THEN SECOND THE LAWS AND THE REGULATIONS OF THE STATE. DICTATE THE PROCESS OF THE INVESTIGATION AND I'M GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH THAT NOW. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ALLOW US TO CONDUCT. AN INVESTIGATION AND THIRTY OR SIXTY DAYS. SO I'M FIRST AND FOREMOST- THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS- PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RESTRICT THE INVESTIGATION ONLY. TO PREPARING OBJECTIONS WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE INFORMATION WE MUST FULLY AND FAIRLY. GATHER ALL OF THE PERTINENT INFORMATION- AND WHETHER IT REQUIRES OR EXCUSES BENEFITS. AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO DOCUMENT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION- IN CASE OF LITIGATION OR INVESTIGATION FROM THE STATE OKAY. SO WHAT IS THE INVESTIGATION LOOK LIKE- WE DO PHONE INTERVIEWS WITH THE INJURED WORKER THE EMPLOYER. WITNESS SAYS- THE DOCTOR- WE SEND THE INJURED WORKER A MEDICAL RELEASE FORM TO OBTAIN PRIOR RELEVANT MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT CAN TAKE SOME TIME TO COME BACK- AND THEN ULTIMATELY IF THE IF THE CLAIM IS GOING TO BE. DENIED BASED ON A MEDICAL REASON YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE STATE'S MEDICAL LEGAL PROCESS OKAY SO WHAT DOES THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE. THE PARTY'S REQUEST A PANEL OF DOCTORS FROM THE STATE THE STATE THEN ENDS US THAT PANEL W SELECT THE DOCTOR SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT RECEIVE. THE REPORT OKAY BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT SO HERE'S- WHAT THE REGULATIONS AND STATUTES SAY TODAY AND THIS IS UNCHANGED BY THE CURRENT BILL. ONCE A CLAIM IS FILED THE WORKER HAS TEN DAYS TO REQUEST THE PANEL ON THE ROOM BEFORE WE CAN'T SO TEN DAYS GOES BY BEFORE WE CAN EVEN REQUEST THE PANEL. THE STATE THEN HAS TEN DAYS TO SEND US THE PANEL. THEN WE HAVE THE EMPLOYEE HAS TEN DAYS TO PICK A DOCTOR BEFORE WE CAN PICK. THE THIRTY DAYS IS OVER RIGHT THERE. UNDER THE SPELL ON PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS. IT'S DONE WE CAN NO LONGER PROCEED THE THIRTY DAYS IS OVER WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE STATE'S PROCESS. ONCE A DOCTOR IS SELECTED AN APPOINTMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SCHEDULED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. AND THEN A REP A MEDICAL REPORT IS DELIVERED THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT. SO WE'RE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS INTO THE PROCESS JUST BASED ON THE STATE REGULATORY STRUCTURE THIS ISN'T AN EMPLOYER STRUCTURE THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE STRUCTURE AND IT'S THE- DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION STRUCTURE. ON TOP OF THAT THE STATE AUDITOR DID A PANEL AT. AN AUDIT OF THE Q. I. ME PROCESS A FEW YEARS AGO- AND FOUND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE WERE- THE NUMBER OF- INCREASE WERE UP THIRTY. THE NUMBER OF PANEL REQUESTS WAS INCREASED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS AVAILABLE WAS DOWN TWELVE PERCENT. THE PROCESS IS MOVING SLOWER AND THE REPORT QUALITY IS SLOW. SO THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE CHOOSING TO DO IT IS A STATE RUN PROCESS WITH STATE RULES. AND WE SIMPLY ADHERE TO IT. MMHM THE CURRENT BILL CHANGES NONE OF THESE DETAILS IT SIMPLY SAYS DO IT FASTER WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY RELIEF. FOR THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS IN STATE LAW NOW SO WITH THAT- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST REGISTER MY OPPOSITION AND URGE YOUR NOTEBOOK TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. ARSENAL CERTAIN THAT WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND LEAD WITNESS. I'M IN OPPOSITION FAITH LANE FORCES FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. WELCOME AND THANK YOU SHERRIN MEMBER STATE BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES. GPS OR THE NOT FOR PROFIT MECHANISM THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE TO EFFECTIVELY SELL FUNDS ARE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. AT THE GOAL OF PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IS TO HELP ALL INJURED WORKERS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE AND RETURN BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS THEY ARE SAFELY ABLE TO DO SO. THIS BILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASES STATUTORY TIME FRAMES. FOR AN EMPLOYER TO OBTAIN NECESSARY INFORMATION TO APPROVE. APPROPRIATE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND DENY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. DURING THE PERIOD OF DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS. EMPLOYERS FINED UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MEDICAL CARE FOR INJURED WORKERS EVEN IF THE CLAIM IS ULTIMATELY DENIED. WITHOUT NECESSARY MEDICAL RECORDS AND MEDICAL EVALUATIONS EMPLOYERS MAY BE FORCED TO DENY CLAIMS. WHICH HOLDS EMPLOYER FUNDED MEDICAL CARE WHICH CAUSES A NIGHTMARE FOR THE INJURED WORKER AND INCREASES. FRICTION WITHIN THE SYSTEM IN LITIGATION. ALL EMPLOYERS ARE BOUND BY STATUTORY AND REGULAR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AS YOU JUST HEARD. MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYERS CONTROL. THE SYSTEM REQUIRES PARTICIPATION FROM THE INJURED WORKER. TOURNEY'S AND THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS. AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF CLAIMS OVER% THE LAST TWO YEARS SHOWED THAT NEARLY 20% OF DENIALS. WERE DUE TO THE INJURED WORKERS REFUSAL TO PROVIDE A STATEMENT OR SIGN A MEDICAL RELEASE. 20% OF DENIALS WERE DUE TO NEGATIVE CODED TESTS. 20% OF DENIALS WERE DUE TO THE PHYSICIANS INDICATION THAT THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM A DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATED INJURY. OR THAT THE INJURY WAS WORK RELATED. 27% OF DENIALS ARE BECAUSE THAT RECORDS OR DAILY RATIONS COULD NOT BE OBTAINED WITHIN THE STATUTORY NINETY DAYS. THESE REASONS BECAUSE AN ADMINISTRATOR TO PROVISIONALLY DENY A CLAIM. UNTIL THEY HAVE A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF INDUSTRIAL. CAUSATION SO WE WERE WELCOME FURTHER CON. ON THIS AT HIS. THE SYSTEM DOES WORK TO ENSURE THAT ANY WORKER WITH AN INDUSTRIAL INJURY RECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT AT NO COST TO THE WORKER. RECENT REPORTS SHOW THAT 90% OF ALL CLAIMS ARE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY AND THE NUMBER IS HIGHER FOR FIREFIGHTERS. THE ALL PRESENTED CASES EVEN THE CODE CLAIMS FOR NINE AM PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ARE COVERED BY PRESUMPTIONS ARE LARGELY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD MANDATE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RECEIVED FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES RECEIVED FOR THE STEAM INJURIES OF UNREASONABLE DENIAL EACH DENIAL OF A REBUTTABLE. PRESUMPTION MAY BE LITIGATED AS UNREASONABLE AND ADDED MINIMUM THIS DRASTICALLY INCREASES THE COST OF ALL TO ALL EMPLOYERS. AND HEARINGS TO ADDRESS THESE PENALTY POSITIONS WILL DELAY JUDY CATION OF WORKERS CLAIMED. BY LIMITING THE INVESTIGATION PERIOD TO THIRTY DAYS AT ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN HAMSTRINGS EMPLOYERS INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH APPROPRIATE AND QUESTIONABLE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS. ALL THAT GUARANTEEING LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO APPROPRIATE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS OR DENIED INVALID FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND THEN IT PENALIZES THE EMPLOYER FOR DOING A GOOD JOB ON THE INVESTIGATION. ULTIMATELY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE ABBREVIATED TIME FRAME WILL INCREASE CLAIM DENIALS FOSTER INCREASED AND UNNECESSARY LITIGATION DRIVER CLAIMS COSTS AND ULTIMATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT INJURED WORKERS. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH US AND OUT OF THE SPONSOR WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS BUT AT THIS TIME WE REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED.

EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY IS KEY TO ADDRESSING THE NATION'S RETIREMENT INCOME CRISIS AND THE SQUEEZE ON WORKING FAMILIES. THE MODEST BENEFITS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO VETERANS AS WELL AS WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND OTHERS WILL PAY FOR EXTERMINATION REQUIRING BOTH THE TOP TO CONTRIBUTE MORE IS KEY TO ADDRESSING INCOME INEQUALITY.

FIVE SEVEN TWO THREE THE SOCIAL SECURITY TWENTY ONE UNDER ACT WOULD FIX MANY PROBLEMS AND EQUITIES AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM BUT ONE IT WOULD INCREASE THE BASE GRANTS ANY ANNUAL COLA THE ELDER ECONOMIC INDEX WHICH IS A MUCH MORE REALISTIC OUR SYSTEM OF THE COST OF LIVING FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. H. R. FIVE SEVEN TWO THREE WILL IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR BENEFICIARIES THE PILE BUT EARNED BENEFITS. AND IT WILL BETTER STAFF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. IT REPEALED THE HORRENDOUS WINDFALL EXEMPTION PROVISION AND GOVERNMENT PENSION OFFSET WHICH DRAWS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF S. J. R. ELEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH I'M IN A POSITION THAT THEY ARE ELEVEN. YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE HAVE NO LINES IN OPPOSITION MODERATOR- WE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT IN TIME- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD MOVE THE RESOLUTION OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR WHICH WE WILL TAKE UP ONCE WE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- SENATOR SKINNER TOO CLOSE THANKS SO MUCH I THINK READ THE- EXPERT SPOKE TO IT I THINK THE KEY THING TO NOTE. THAT WAS REFERENCED BUT NOT SPELLED OUT IS THAT THERE IS A CAP WAS PUT ON WAGE EARNERS OF A HUNDRED AND BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WHERE THE WAGE EARNER AT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IN FACT. SAME PICA AS A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND WAGE EARNER AND THAT IF WE JUST FIX THAT WHICH OF COURSE S. J. R. LEVIN OUR ROUTE THROUGH THE BUILD THAT STR ELEVEN. WORDING WOULD DO YOU WOULD FIX THAT THEN WE COULD ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL. AND I THINK MANY- MANY LEGISLATORS- OF COURSE HAVE THIS ON YOUR MIND SINCE WE DO NOT GET PENSIONS THEN THERE MAY BE A GOOD NUMBER OF US WHO WILL BE. LIKE OVER. OVER SIXTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS POTENTIALLY LIVING ON SOCIAL SECURITY ALONE. WITHOUT ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU CONSIDER SKINNER IN THE- WE WILL MOVE ON TO. THE CONSULTANT ON THE MOTION BY SENATOR LAYERED IN THE HOUSE OF THE CONSOLE IN THE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED COURTESY ALL RIGHT COURTESY I OR TROUBLE. THE TROUBLE NO VOTING THE RUSSELL. THE REST SO I LAYERED HI THERE TO FIND HUMAN. NEWMAN HI THE THAT ITEM IS OUT ON A FOUR TO ONE VOTE. FOUR ZERO FOUR ZERO I'M SORRY WE HAD NO OPPOSITION THERE WAS. FOUR AFFIRMATIVE VOTES THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER THE NEXT WE HAVE CENTER DRAWS SO I'M PRESENTING SP NINETY ONE AND SHE WILL FALL WITH TWO OTHER BILLS BUT WILL CALL THOSE IN DUE COURSE AND- AS I START TO SAY EARLIER YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME 2% FROM HERE UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MR CHAIR R. AND MEMBERS OF SP NINE FIVE ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WORKERS CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER. BOND WITH A NEW CHILD OR RECOVER FROM THEIR OWN SERIOUS ILLNESS BY INCREASING THE WAGE REPLENISHMENT REPLACEMENT RATES. WERE THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS WHEN THEY USE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE OR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. ALMOST ALL PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND WHICH PROVIDES WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR WORKERS THROUGH THE STI AND- THE PFL PROGRAMS HOWEVER. MIDDLE AND HIGH WAGE WORKERS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO USE THESE BENEFITS THAN LOW WAGE WORKERS THIS MEANS LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZING BELIEVE OF HIGHER WAGE WORKERS. WHEN WORKERS ARE ASKED ABOUT WHY THEY DO NOT UTILIZE THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEY GIVE TWO REASONS THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT LOST WAGES ONE ANDTWO THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THEIR JOBS. WELL IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED JOB PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS OUT ON FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE WE HAVE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING LOST INCOME. TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. AS B. NINE FIFTY ONE PROPOSES TO PHASE IN A WHO EARN LESS THAN 70 F THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE. UP VOTE NINETY. AND IT WOULD BE FOR UP TO SIXTEEN WEEKS OF DISABILITY INSURANCE AND UP TO EIGHT WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE ALL OTHER WORKERS. OF THOSE ABOVE 70% ALL WOULD RECEIVE 70% WAGE REPLACEMENT. UP TO THE MAXIMUM WEEKLY BENEFIT. TO ACHIEVE THIS AS B. NINE FIFTY ONE SIMPLY REMOVES THE TAXABLE WAGE CEILING. ENSURING ALL WORKERS CONTRIBUTE AN EQUAL PERCENTAGE WHICH IS CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% OF THEIR WAGE INCOME INTO THE STI FUND. WORKERS CURRENTLY EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD PAY NO MORE THAN THEY DO CURRENTLY. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE AND TAKING THE TIME THEY NEED TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER BOND WITH A NEW CHILD OR RECOVER FROM THEIR OWN ILL ILLNESS. TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR HERE TO PRESENT AS B. NINE FIVE ONE CATHERINE WITH CHET- STAFF ATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AID AT WORK. AND JERRY SANDOVAL MARY PARENT. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO- WE WILL CALL THE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES AT THIS TIME AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH ORDER THEY'RE GOING TO SPEAK AND SO I WILL CALL THEM IN THE ORDER YOU JUST INDICATED- SENATOR CATHERINE- CAPTAIN WHICH YET- ARE YOU. ON THE TELECONFERENCE ON YES OKAY VERY PLEASED WITH RECEIVING AN AREA THANK YOU. OKAY GREAT- HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS KATHERINE WHICH ADMINISTAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO ADVANCING THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS WITH LOW WAGES. AND WEAK. AND STRONG RECORD OF AT NINE FIVE ONE BECAUSE HE HAD FAMILY LEAVE AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE ARE CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA FAMILY. LEAVE PROGRAMS PROVIDE INCOME WHEN WORKERS ARE UNABLE TO WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH CONDITIONS OR THE NEED TO BRING A FAMILY MEMBER ON CONDITION ADULT. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND EVEN HAVE LONG. TERM IMPACT ON CHILD TO DEVELOP. IMPORTANTLY THE FROM ARE FOR IT WE SIMPLY BY WORKERS AVAILABLE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. BUT CURRENTLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND- SO THE INSURANCE ONLY PAYS MOST WORKERS 60% OF THEIR INCOME MAY VERY LIKELY ALREADY BE STRUGGLING TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY WILL ONLY RECEIVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS PER WEEK FROM STI WORKING FAMILY LEAVE. AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO LIVE ON THAT MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FALLING DEEPER INTO DEBT OR SIMPLY GOING BACK TO WORK FOR A DAY FOR YOUR FAMILY NUMBER ARE READY. AND WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THESE INADEQUATE BRAKES PREVENT FATHERS FROM TAKING BONDING TIME THEY FORCED NEW PARENTS BACK TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE STILL RECOVERING FROM CHILDBIRTH AND IT PREVENTS ADULT CHILDREN FROM BEING ABLE TO BE THERE FOR THEIR AGING PARENTS. AND THIS IS BORNE OUT IN THE DATA RIGHT NOW FOLKS EARNING UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR MAKE UP 37% OF THOSE WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUND BUT ONLY 14% OF THOSE WHO USE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND ONLY 18% OF. THOSE WHO MAKE THE I. CLAIMS. AT THE NINE FIVE ONE WOULD FIX THIS BECAUSE I 9% OF REGULAR INCOME THE LOW WAGE WORKERS TO APPLY FOR THESE PROGRAMS. IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EIGHT WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND TWICE AS LONG FOR SBI. SIXTEEN WEEKS. WHICH IS THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF ALL S. YEAH I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT IT WOULD MAKE THE MOST. ATHLETIC PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THE PAPER THE IMPROVEMENTS WHILE PROTECTING THE D. I. FUNDS WHICH SUPPLIES THESE PROGRAMS DEVELOP IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WITH SIMPLY DELETE AN EXEMPTION THAT CURRENTLY SHELTERS INCOME. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM BEING SUBJECT TO CONTRIBUTION. WITHOUT THESE CHANGES BOTH STI IN PFL WILL REMAIN OUT OF REACH FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED THE MOST. RECENT. OUT HERE I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEST. IN THE WE'RE GOING TO CALL- NOW ON. TERRY YOUR REASONABLE NEARY. THANK YOU VERY YES YES WE CAN HEAR YOU PLEASE PROCEED TO THE TORIA IT STARTED OFF- MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAME TERRY. NO WORRIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY YES MY NAME IS GERRY SAMPLE I BELIEVE IN SAN DIEGO AND I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COLLISION. AND VANDALISM I AM IDENTIFIED TODAY'S FRONT SUPPORT OF AS THE NINE FIFTY ONE. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD THE RIGHT TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE OUT THE MALE PARENT UNTIL SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT I COULD. MEANT THE WORLD TO ME. THANK GOD MY NEWBORN. HAVE A LOOK FIRST ENCOUNTERS WITH- HELPING AROUND THE HOUSE. REALLY HAPPY MY DAUGHTER CHANGED MY LIFE. I HAD THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH HER. BUT WHEN I GOT MY FIRST BASICALLY ET. I REALIZED I COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND PAY MY BILL. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING BUT I REALIZED THAT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RETURN BACK TO WORK. I WORK TWO JOBS A GREATER SHIFT IN ANOTHER JOB AGAIN IN THE MORNING. I WOULD ONLY FIFTY FOUR HOURS A NIGHT I WOULD DECIDE TO GET HOME AFTER WORK AND TELL MY KID A LOVER. AND STILL TRY TO HELP OUT AROUND THE HOUSE. I THINK THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ARE THE ONES. WHO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SAVE MONEY. WHEN YOU LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK LIKE I DID. NOT FIT INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN 76% WHICH WOULD LIKE. TO PUT PEOPLE IN A SITUATION LIKE THE ONE THE LECTURE IS ALEXANDER. WHERE THEY CAN'T- THEY CAN'T HAPPEN THAT MAKE SOME DECISIONS. LIKE WHETHER IT WILL WORK OR STAY HOME. WITH THE BABY OR TAKE CARE OF A FAMILY MEMBER WITH ST. ONLY VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT THE MALE PERSON I WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK MY FAMILY. AND I WANT THE BEST MY CHILD. I MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES FOR MY FAMILY. AT THE END OF THE DAY FAMILIES WHO IS THERE FOR YOU. I FEEL LIKE- I DID SERVE TO TAKE A LEAVE WHEN I NEED TO. PURCHASE THE PROGRAM BUT I'M PAYING INTO. THE ONLY WAY I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS THAT IF THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE IS INCREASED TO NINETY PERCENT. I KNOW I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE LIKE ME. PLEASE VOTE YES ON SB NINETY ONE TODAY. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE WILL NOW MOVE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND- ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE WHO WISHES TO.

THAT'S FORTY ONE ALL RIGHT GOOD SO THAT BILL IS OUT NOW ON A FOUR TO ONE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO WILL GIVE BACK TO- OR ORDINARY KITCHEN THE SEQUENCE HERE THE NEXT BILL IN ORDER IS S. B. TEN FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR DRAWS A SENDER. IF YOU'RE PREPARED YOU MAY PRESENT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES SP TEN FORTY FOUR IS A BILL THAT WILL ALLOW WORKERS. TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MOBILE PHONES OR OTHER COMMUNICATION DEVICES AS WELL AS- BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE WORKPLACE. FOR THEIR SAFETY IN THE EVENT OF A STATE OR EMERGENCY OR EMERGENCY CONDITION. BEFORE MOVING AHEAD I WANT TO INDICATE I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND I THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF WERE WORKING WITH US THE CLEAR FIGHT WHEN WE NEED THIS PROTECTION IN PLACE. AND THAT IT IS A TEMPORARY PROTECTION HI TO THE EXISTENCE OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO NOTIFY THE EMPLOYER BEFORE LEAVING THE PREMISES DUE TO EMERGENCY CONDITIONS IF IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY. WORKER SAFETY IS A BASIC PROTECTION WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE ALL CALIFORNIANS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN CASES OF WORKERS BEING PUT IN VULNERABLE AND LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE TO WORK. DESPITE THE IMMINENT THREAT OF A STATE OR EMERGENCY OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY CONDITION. IN CALIFORNIA EXAMPLES OF DECLARED STATE OR EMERGENCIES INCLUDING WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES EMERGENCY CONDITIONS THAT ALSO NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR INCLUDE MAN MADE EMERGENCIES SITUATIONS INCLUDING MASS SHOOTINGS AND TERROR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE SEASON IS NOW A YEAR LONG THREAT WITH NINE OF THE LARGEST AND SEVEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVING OCCURRED IN THE LAST DECADE IN THE MIDST OF THESE CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES OF WORKERS HAVING BEEN REQUIRED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WORKING. AS FIRE APPROACHED THE WORKPLACE AND THE OTHERS WERE EVACUATED AGRICULTURAL WORKERS INVENTOR AND CINEMA COUNTIES WERE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE PICKING PRODUCE DURING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THOMAS AND THAT LIST OF FIRES JUST A FEW MILES FROM THE FIRE LINES WITH MINIMAL CONSIDERATION FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES HEALTH AND SAFETY WILDFIRES CONTINUE TO ROAR AND THREATEN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN GETTY FIRE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DOMESTIC WORKERS AND LANDSCAPERS WERE STILL REQUIRED TO REPORT TO WORK IN THE EVACUATED HILL PROPERTIES AS THE THREAD OF THE FIRE LOOMED AROUND THEM- A SIMILAR INCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED IN AMAZON WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. WHERE WORKERS ARE BEING PLACED IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN THE MIDST OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS THESE INCIDENTS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO SET CLEAR STANDARDS TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE IN REAL TIME DURING THESE EVENTS. AS B. TEN FORTY FOUR WOULD ENHANCE EXISTING WORKER PROTECTIONS DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR EMERGENCY CONDITIONS BY PROVIDING CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS TO ALLOW WORKERS TO ACCESS PHONES OR THE COMMUNICATIONS. AND BEING PERMITTED TO LEAVE IF THEY DO SO FOR THEIR SAFETY OR THAT OF THEIR CHILDREN. OF THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED CONCERNS SUCH AS THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED IT AND THESE ARE A RESPONSE THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO LAST THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY IT APPLIES ONLY WHERE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS EXIST AND AGAIN THIS WAS INCLUDED IN THE COMMIT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THIS BILL IS NOT DUE CLICK TO DOES NOT DUPLICATE EXISTING LAW- THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS GOVERNING. AN EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATIONS OR WORKERS RIGHT DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR EMERGENCY CONDITIONS THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE UNSAFE WORK WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT UNSAFE WORK ASSIGNMENTS OR AN UNSAFE JOB YOU DON'T GO- HOLDING UP YOU KNOW SIXTY POUND BOXES OR- OR GOING THROUGH A LOT OF WIRES- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONDITIONS OUTSIDE THE EMPLOYERS CONTROL. THE MAKE THE WORKSITE UNSAFE THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE UNSAFE WORK ARE SEEKING EXEMPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT THIS HOW THIS APPLIES TO WORKERS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES MY STAFF STARTED THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ARM AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THEM THIS WEEK TO SEE IF WE CAN HIT OF A BALANCE COLLEAGUES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WITNESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THAT EMERGENCIES AND NATURAL DISASTERS CONTINUE TO HAVE ON OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY ARE VULNERABLE WORKERS. WE HAVE TO RESPOND BY PROVIDING CLEAR PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS AND CLEAR RULES FOR EMPLOYERS TO KEEP WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILY SAFE WITH ME TODAY AS WITNESSES ARE RON AT ATA PRESIDENT OF THE LA COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR AS WELL AS KARINA LOPEZ FORMER AMAZON WORKER JUSTICE HAS TO FIGHT AND SUPPORT. I ALSO HAVE CAITLIN VEGA. WHO IS UP L. A. FEDERATION OF LABOR OF WAS ON THE LINE TO HELP WITH ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK SENATOR- MR IF YOU'RE THERE- YOU MAY PROCEED TO TESTIFY. IF YOU CARRY MEMBERS HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR PROUD SPONSOR OF SB TEN FORTY FOUR. THE COUNTY FEDERATION REPRESENTS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNION MEMBERS THROUGHOUT GREATER LOS ANGELES THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE BLACK AND BROWN WORKERS. IT IS OUR JOB TO MAINTAIN THE BASIC PROTECTIONS WORKING PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS NEEDED BUT ALSO TO LOOK AHEAD AT. EMERGING THREATS THAT WORKERS FACE AS CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS OUR ENVIRONMENT IT ALSO IMPACTS OUR WORK SITE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS I'VE SEEN MORE FIRES THREATEN WORKERS ON THE JOB THAN I DID. IN ALL THE PREVIOUS DECADES IN LA COUNTY ALONE WE'VE HAD WILDFIRES FLOODING MUDSLIDES IN EXTREME HEAT STATE LAW MUST NOW KEEP UP TO ENSURE WORKERS ARE PROTECTED DURING EMERGENCIES AND NATURAL DISASTERS. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WE ALL HEARD THE STORIES OF AMAZON WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND DRIVERS IN ILLINOIS' WHO WERE NOT PERMITTED TO LEAVE DURING A TORNADO SADLY. SIX AMAZON WORKERS AND SEVERAL OTHER FACTORY WORKERS WERE KILLED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE WORK SITE TO FIND SAFETY THEY WERE ALSO TOLD NOT TO ACCESS THEIR PHONES TO TRACK WEATHER CONDITIONS. IN MY OPINION THE TEAMSTERS WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN TO WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WORKERS BUT WE KNOW THAT FARM WORKERS DOMESTIC WORKERS AND LANDSCAPING WORKERS ARE OFTEN THE ONES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WORKING. IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS AT THE FEDERATION UNION EVERY INDUSTRY WE HAVE HEARD THESE STORIES FROM OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CURRENT LAW IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE FOR THESE REASONS THE ALLEY COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR IS PROUD TO SPONSOR. THIS BILL WITH THE TEAMSTERS UNION AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY UNIONS AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WE THANK SENATOR MARIA LANDED ASAL PREPARING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR A DATE OF THE ACCIDENT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR THE NEXT WHAT KARINA LOPEZ IF YOU'RE THERE YOU MAY PRESS. OKAY THANK YOU. SENATOR FOR G. MY NAME IS KARINA LOPEZ MY FAMILY WORK THAT'S- ON THE WAREHOUSE LOS ANGELES. RAMS SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN FORTY FOUR ALTERED BY SENATOR MARTY AND THEN NOT TO WRESTLE. FOR FULL TRAVEL FROM. THE HIGHLY STRESSFUL AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE CONSTANTLY PRESSURED AND IT MIGHT WORK FASTER THAN. I THOUGHT HIGH INJURY RATES THAT RESULT FROM THIS HIGH SPEED AND HIGH PRESSURE WORK ENVIRONMENT AMAZON CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE PRODUCTION OVER IT ASSOCIATES. MY WRIST WAS ACTUALLY INJURED IN JANUARY THIS YEAR BECAUSE I WAS PRESSURED TO SCAN PACKAGES. OF FASTER DURING ONE STATION TO MEET THEIR RATE- I'M STILL IN PAIN RIGHT NOW AND I HAVE TO GO TO PHYSICAL THERAPY- FOR AMAZON PACKAGES ME MORE THAN WORKERS. EVEN IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS WAREHOUSE FIRES OR NOT THE DISASTERS AMAZON HAS PROVEN THAT IT WILL NOT PUT THE SAFETY OF ITS WORKERS OVER THEIR BOTTOM LINE. DURING THE BOBCAT PLAYERS IN TWENTY TWENTY MANY OF MY COWORKERS WORKED IN A WAREHOUSE NEAR THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS. REFLECTED TO CONTINUE SHOWING UP TO WORK DESPITE THE HIGHLY UNSAFE CONDITIONS. I'M I'M CONTINUOUSLY IGNORED WORKERS CONCERNS ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY IN THE WAREHOUSE WHICH IS ESPECIALLY BAD. BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE FIGHTERS. WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT THAT IN. TO WORK IN BEING AND CONDITION. WE HAVE FAMILY AND COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON US. AND THEN IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS WE NEED TO FEEL EMPOWERED TO CHOOSE OUR SAFETY AT WORK. AT FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL ALLOW WORKERS THE PROTECTION TO CHOOSE THEIR SAFETY WITHOUT RISKING THEIR ECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD. I PRACTICE BEFORE AND WE STAND FORTY FOUR AND- YOUR GUESTS VOTE. FEAST REASONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OF BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM HERE WILL ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE PRESENT WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. HAS BECOME A FORTY.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU YOUR MODERATOR OF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO LEAD. OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO- AND I'M GONNA CALL ON ASHLEY HOFFMAN FIRST SERVICE OR IN THE ROOM EARLIER. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON ASHLEY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION SP TEN FORTY FOUR AS A JOB KILLER. WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN TODAY AND DO SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS BY THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE IN THE SPONSOR TO TALK WITH US. BUT I DO WANT TO RAISE SEVERAL CONCERNS. I WANT TO START BY SAYING SAFETY IS AND ALWAYS SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS PROVIDE ROBUST PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS. TO NAME A FEW WORKERS MAY REFUSE TO PERFORM WORK IF IT WOULD VIOLATE THE LAW OR HE WOULD EXPOSE THEM TO SERIOUS INJURY OR WORSE- FURTHER JUST TWO YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL EXPLICITLY SAYING THAT YOU CANNOT FORCE. ANY WORKER INCLUDING A DOMESTIC WORKER TO ENTER OR TO REMAIN IN EVACUATION AREA THEY'RE ALSO LAWS REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE WHEN IT IS SAFE TO WORK IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEAT OR SMOKE. THIS MEANS THAT LARGELY THE EXAMPLES COVER BY THE PROPONENTS WE DO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I BELIVE THOSE ARE LARGELY COVERED BY EXISTING LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE THE EXAMPLE ABOUT ON THE DOMESTIC WORKER BEING ORDERED TO REPORT DURING THE GETTING FIRED THAT WOULD OF COURSE BE PROHIBITED NOW UNDER THE LAW PASSED TWO YEARS AGO- OR IF THERE'S A WORKER YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S A FIRE BLAZING NEXT DOOR ANOTHER IMMINENT DANGER WE THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ILLEGAL RIGHT NOW TO MAKE THAT WORK OR CONTINUE TO WORK. WE THINK THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND THE EMPLOYER SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'M SO OUR CONCERN- TEN FORTY FOUR IS LARGELY TWO FOLD- AS A COMEDIAN HOUSES NOTES IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY CAN LAST FOR A LONG TIME BEYOND WHEN THE DANGER IS PRESENT. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT THE USE OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE EMERGENCY BEING ONGOING WHICH WE THINK IS VERY GOOD AND COULD COVER SOME EMERGENCIES SUCH AS WILDFIRES SMOKE OR OTHERS THAT DO LAST POTENTIALLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. EVEN MORE CAL OSHA HAS DENIED THAT IT IS SAFE TO GO TO WORK. A SECOND AND PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CONCERN WE HAVE THE BILL IS THAT IT GIVES LARGE DISCRETION TO EMPLOYEES THAT IF THEY WALK AWAY FROM A COMPLETELY SAFE WORKPLACE. THERE'S NOTHING THERE WE ARE CAN DO. RISK A LOSS. HEALTH CARE WORKERS FIRST RESPONDERS YOUR OWN LEGISLATIVE STAFF COULD WALK AWAY TODAY. IF THIS BILL IS IN EFFECT IF THEY SAY ANYTHING IS UNSAFE. THE FACT THAT THE EMPLOYER IS FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE LAWS- IS GOING EVEN ABOVE AND BEYOND IS RELEVANT TO THE FACT THAT CAL OSHA OR CD PH OR WHOEVER SAYS IT IS SAFE TO WORK. IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT THE BILL TAKES THE POWER COMPLETELY OUT OF THOSE AGENCIES HANDS. AS FAR AS WHAT CONSTITUTES A SAFER PLACE. FINALLY JUST A PIECE ON ENFORCEMENT- THE BILL IS ENFORCEABLE UNDER PROJECT. I'M PRESENTLY IF YOU HAVE A VIOLATION UNDER PAGA FOR VIOLATION OF THE HEALTH OR SAFETY STATUTE- YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO. FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE BY WHICH WE MUST HAVE THE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATED- BEFORE YOU CAN FILE A LAWSUIT. AND BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT PUT THIS CODE SECTION IN THAT SAME DIVISION AS THE REST OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THAT SAME PROCEDURE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR WORKERS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF GETTING A CITATION IMMEDIATELY THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS RESOLUTION OF A LOSS. TO ADDRESS AT THE VERY LEAST- THIS BE PUT IN THAT SAME DIVISION AS THE OTHER HEALTH AND- THE- YOU- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- THE SECOND LEAD UP SOCIAL WITNESSES JOHNNY PINA- I BELIEVE ON THE COASTLINE. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE NUMBERS STARTING WITH ME WHAT LEGAL CALIFORNIA CITY THANK YOU OFTEN NEED TO TESTIFY TODAY. I'M HERE IN RESPECT OF THIS IN THE SP TEN FORTY FOUR I'D LIKE TO PUT A COMMENT OF THE CALCHAMBER AND ALSO BRIEFLY ADD THE PERSPECTIVE OF LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES. IT IS THE GREASE THAT PLASTIC IN PLACE TO PROTECT WORKERS AND PROVIDE SECRET PLACES HOWEVER AT LEAST IN EARLIER THIS BILL COULD CREEP TELL. AMERICANS THE RESPONSE THIS BILL APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING THOSE RESPONDING DIRECTLY TO EMERGENCIES. CURRENTLY DRAFTED SB TEN FORTY FOUR COULD. INHIBIT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND REDUCE WORKPLACE SAFETY BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM COULD BE RESPONDING TO THE EMERGENCY ENDED AFTER TAKING PLACE TO SIMPLY NOT SHOW UP TO WORK WITH NO RECOURSE IF THEY FEEL UNSAFE REGARDLESS. OF THE SAFETY. MEASURES IN PLACE. FOR ME. IN THE CITIES. FIRST TO DISASTER AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH WHERE EMPLOYEES COULD BE REASSIGNED BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE TIME. THIS BILL MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PLAN AND ORGANIZE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WHEN EMPLOYEES CONFUSED- ABOUT THE JOB OR NOT SHOW UP WITH NO EXCEPTION FOR JOB DUTY OR CLASSIFICATION. THIS WOULD LEAVE THE EMPLOYEES THAT DO SHOW UP WITH MY STAFF TO PERFORM THE DUTIES AT HAND IN. THIS EMERGENCY TIME OUT.

AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH BIG STUFF SO CLOSELY- TO MAKE THOSE MODIFICATIONS- EIGHT I DON'T I WOULD SUPPOSE BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE IS THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE WITH REGARD TO- I THINK WHAT PEOPLE BEEN REFERRING TO IS THE ENDING DATE AND I KNOW. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- DEAL WITH THAT- CERTAINLY FOR TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR PRESENTATION THE INTENT WAS NOT TO CREATE- THE FEDERATION THAT WOULD EXTEND TO THE FULL PERIOD OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH WE ALL KNOW- CAN TAKE SOME TIME. AND- YEAH I THINK WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OPPOSITION IS OR WHAT INTERESTING CONTENT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. BUT LANGUAGE FURTHER AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR RESPONSE OF ANYTHING WAS TO THAT. IN IN TERMS OF VALUE WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM. YES I AM I MEAN. I WILL I HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM. WITH THESE ON THESE ISSUES AND AS LONG AS THE- BASIC INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THE- OF THE- OF THE BILL IS. PRESERVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TUNE IN AGAIN APPRECIATE VERY MUCH WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO TRY TO GET WHAT I THINK IS PRETTY PRETTY GOOD LANGUAGE- BEFORE US TODAY OTHERMEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- SIR NEWMAN AND THANK YOU MISTRESS SHOW FOR- YEAH I DO TOO- GETTING WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS THIS IS ONE OF THESE BILLS THIS IS. TOO LITTLE BILL BIG DEAL RIGHT AT THE MOMENT SO IF THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT I THINK THE SHORTEST- BILL THAT WE HAVE WITH US- AND YET THIS IS CLEARLY A MAJOR. UNDERTAKING SHOW I DO I WANT TO I WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON- MS HOFFMAN'S POINT OF VIEW ABOUT THIS TENSION OF THE JURY DO THIS TENSION BETWEEN. OUR TWO CATS TAKE EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS WHICH ARE INTENTIONALLY BROAD- AND USING CODE EXAMPLE INTEND TO EXTEND WELL BEYOND THAT PERIOD WITH A DANGEROUS PLACEMOST FRAUD- AND THEN TAKE CARE OF THE CAL OSHA- PIECE WHERE YOU KNOW WE START TO GET MORE DEFINITIONAL. AND THERE'S A TENSION THERE- AND SO IS THAT YOUR INDICATED I THINK YOU'RE WILLING TO RENDER SOME CLARITY AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND NOT WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO CORRECT. YES THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND GET WE WANT CLARITY THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO GIVE CLARITY. UNDER CONDITIONS OF EMERGENCY WHERE YOU DIDN'T KNOW. HOW COULD YOU EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE A MASS SHOOTING AT THE SCHOOL FOR YOUR CHILDREN ARE ARE GOING TO SCHOOL HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE FOR THAT YOU KNOW IN IN THE PLAN- IN IN THE SAME WAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL THAT HAPPENED SUDDENLY WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT REAL MOMENT IN TIME. FOR THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT- YOU KNOW EVEREVEN EXPECT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD HAPPEN EVEN UNDER THE QUICK WHAT DID YOU SAY HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT. YOUR PARTICULAR WORKPLACE OR- YOUR FAMILY. WHERE YOU'RE FROM IS LIVING. YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT WOULD WE WANT DO IN CASE OF AN EARTHQUAKE. THAT HITS YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY WHERE YOUR HOME IS. YOU WANNA LEAVE. YOU WANNA LEAVE AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY. THERE'S A POTENTIAL OF A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION SO. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO CLARIFY BECAUSE OF THE RULES AS THEY ARE TODAY THE LAWS AS THEY ARE TODAY. DO NOT COVER THESE ALL POINT IN REAL TIME SITUATIONS. NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME. SORT OF RESPECT THIS GAME AS TO WHETHER OR NOT- THERE'S ALREADY A LAW IN PLACE- THAT COVERS SUN AT LEAST SOME OF THESE DIMENSIONS AND SO I I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO WORK WITH. OPPOSITION WITH THE CONSULTANTS- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE YOU KOW WE GET CLARITY. ABSOLUTELY YOU SHOULD THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR THANKS SIR. RESELLER NEWMAN- INSULAR ARM. THE SENATOR NEWMAN DID A BUNCH OF WHAT I WANT TO DO BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ON TWO LEVELS I THINK THE ACTUAL SITUATIONS THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THE QUESTION IS HOW TO MAKE SURE THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES THAT. IN THE RIGHT BUT TO BE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME OF THE SIR DEREK- I HAD BEEN ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR. SIX WEEKS WHEN WE HAD THE HUNDRED YEAR STORM. AND IT TRUST. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED SUDDENLY THE RIVER IS A FOOT FROM FLOOD STAGE AND FLOODING THE WHOLE DOWNTOWN SEVENTY FIVE FOOT REDWOOD TREES BATTERED DOWN THE BRIDGE R. A. AND I'M AT WORK IN THE COURTHOUSE LOOKING DOWN AT THIS WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING CALLS AND SAYING GET UP TO THE MOUNTAINS YOU'RE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE YOU CAN GET THERE SAFELY AND WE'RE GONNA BE MAROONED FOR AWHILE AND SO N. THEN I HAD THE MISFORTUNE. TO HAVE THAT SAME DOWNTOWN DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE A FEW YEARS LATER 60% OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THE DOWNTOWN WAS DESTROYED AND THERE WERE THESE HORRIFIC SITUATIONS OF A GENERATOR GOING IN THE NIGHT. AFTER THE QUAKE WOULD HAVE CAUSED. THE EARTH. THE WALLS TO SHAKE OF UNREINFORCED BRICK WHERE THEY WERE DIGGING FOR PEOPLE AND THEY HAD REAL TOUGH LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS TO MAKE. ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE THOSE SEARCH AND RESCUES IN THE DARK WHEN THOSE WERE THE ONLY CONDITIONS AND SO. I SUBSCRIBE TO BOTH PARTS THERE ARE THESE SITUATIONS END. NOBODY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR PROTECTING THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REALLY APPLIES TO THEM SO. OUR OUR OUR WORLD- YOU KNOW HAPPILY MOVE THIS ALONG AND ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE. BUT THEN YOU LOOK AT HOW IT APPLIES IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT MORE SO AND I APPRECIATE THE- THE AUTHORS ARE CONSTANT WILLINGNESS TO TAFT. TACKLED DIFFICULT SITUATIONS IN THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLE THAT IS ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR OF YOUR LEADERSHIP CENTER DRAWS SO AND- ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE FOR WAR FOR SAFETY TO PUT IT MILDLY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YOU WANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE THIS TIME. WELL I JUST- I KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE WORK PLACES THAT FIND THEMSELVES COULD FIND THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW GOD WILLING THEY DON'T BUT IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES ARE YOU KNOW THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND- THEY'RE THE ONES IN SOME WAYS THAT NEED THE MOST PROTECTION. I FIND THAT OUR HUMAN INSTINCT IS NOT TO RUN AWAY FROM SOMETHING THIS TO RUN TOWARDS AND HELP OTHER. OTHER PEOPLE FIVE IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE CHANGING PEOPLE'S. MENTALITY THEY'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO RUN AWAY FROM FROM AN EMERGENCY. BUT THEY DO HAVE TO OF COURSE WATCH OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY SO. I APPRECIATE THE- THE QUESTIONS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD- ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL MOVE TO THE CONSULTANT- AS FOR ROLL CALL VOTE ON SENATOR BYRD'S MOTION AT THIS TIME.

TEN FIFTY EIGHT. DISABILITY INSURANCE BILL IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO MAKE PRESENT ON THAT BILL. I THINK THIS ONE'S A LOT SIMPLER- MR KERR THANK YOU AND MEMBERS- S. B. TEN FIFTY EIGHT SIMPLY REQUIRES OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- TO COLLECT DATA REGARDING THE RACE AND ETHNICITY OF INDIVIDUALS WILL PLY FOR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE ON THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM SO YOU COULD SEE THE CONNECTION WITH OUR PREVIOUS BILL. IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THIS DATA IS TRACKED AND REPORTED ON IN ORDER TO INFORM ONGOING OUTREACH EFFORTS. EDT ALREADY COLLECTS DATA. ON THE RACE AND ETHNICITY OF APPLICANTS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT NOT FOR- STATE DISABILITY PAID FAMILY LEAVE. GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM- PRIOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH RACIAL DISPARITIES STILL EXIST WITH RESPECT TO AWARENESS. AND UPTAKE OF STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THE EDT MUST BEGIN TO COLLECT THIS DATA IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ASSESS AND ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES MY WITNESSES TODAY OUR CELEBS STEIGER LEGAL AID AT WORK AND ANDREA RIVERA CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK THANK YOU MR.

MY NAME IS ANDREA RIVERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FRIENDS. OPEN AT FIRST WOULD BE KIND. THE STATEWIDE MULTICULTURAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT ADVANCES HEALTH EQUITY FOR BLACK INDIGENOUS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IN ORDER TO TRULY ADVANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE DISPARITIES AND ALL OF OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAM. WE MUST PRIORITIZE POLICIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND THEN TARGET CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. COMPLETE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA IS THE FIRST STEP IN ACKNOWLEDGING AND THEN REDUCING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. OVER NINETEEN KINDA BANK HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CALIFORNIANS ARGUABLY THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE MOST NEED. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS IN THE PAST YOU INCREASED WAGE REPLACEMENT EXTEND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND PROVIDE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. ACT BEHIND THE VAT IS EXTREMELY FOCUSED ON ACCOMPLISHING ONE CRITICAL ASPECT THAT REMAINS MISSING FROM THE ENTIRE PROCESS. WHICH IS DATA COLLECTION BY REPRESSED BY REQUIRING THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON RACE AND ETHNICITY I THINK HER THIRTY EIGHT PUBLISHES THE FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS DEEPLY EMBEDDED SYSTEMIC BARRIERS. AFTER THE LOOTED SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES FROM CLEANING ESSENTIAL SUPPORT FOR FAR TOO LONG. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A RESEARCH STUDY BY ANDREW CHANG COMPANY WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE EDT WAS PUBLISHED AND THE REPORT FOUND WIDESPREAD EQUITIES WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER IN THE DOCTORS GET FAMILY LEAVE REQUESTS ARE EXTREMELY UNDER UTILIZED ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT ESPECIALLY. LGBTQ COMMUNITY. IF YOU COMMUNITIES ARE THAT WITH. OR TO TACKED AT THE END OVER. A FRENCH LACK CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND FINALLY LATIN EXTREMITIES REPORTED VERY LOW GENERAL AWARENESS THAT THE FAMILY LEAVE LEAVE PROGRAM WHERE TYPICALLY BIOLOGICAL MOTHERS AND THEY WERE INFORMED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE HOSPITAL. AT THREE TEN FIFTY EIGHT WOULD SEEK OUT A SIMPLE QUESTION TO THE ALREADY EXISTING APPLICATION PROCESS THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THE CENTRAL TO AFFECTING AND INCREASING USE OF EDB PROGRAM ALL CALIFORNIANS.

I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT AT THE TEN FIFTY EIGHT AND WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK SENATOR DROPPED THOUGH. FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK TEN FIFTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO COLLECT OFFICIAL RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FROM STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE CLAIMANTS.

IN A RECENT STUDY OF NEW MOTHERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT HISPANIC WOMEN. RECEIVE NO PAY AT ALL FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHILE TAKING LEAVE COMPARED. TO JUST IMPLANT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO COLLECT SPECIAL RATE VANITY DATA. AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE CLAIMANT. DATA WILL PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS WITH CLEAR AND MEASURABLE INFORMATION ABOUT KNOWN RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH REFORM TARGETED OUTREACH AND UPTAKE EFFORT AMONG COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING LEFT BEHIND. CONSIDERING WORKERS OF ALL RACIAL BACKGROUNDS PAY INTO THE FUND. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE EDT COLLECT RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA TO MAKE SURE. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY YOU TO EXISTING LAW COLLECTION OF FREE FITNESS THE DATA WERE REQUIRED TO EAT LIKE VOLUNTARY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER-IDENTITY INFORMATION AS WELL.

I HAVE THIS THURSDAY WITH- SP TEN FIFTY EIGHT AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE GOOD DATA THAT PROVIDES MORE IN DEPTH INSIGHTS INTO HOW THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY WAS BEING UTILIZED HOWEVER. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WILL ADD YET ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY TD AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDED A PLETHORA OF NEW REQUIREMENTS- TO THEIR PLATE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE EDT PRIORITIZED RESPONDING TO AN IMPROVING THEIR OPERATIONAL DEFICIENCIES DEFICIENCIES SO THAT THEY CAN TRULY SERVE THE SAFETY NET AND SOTHAT WE DO NOT SEE A REPEAT OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHICH- COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED- AS SOMEONE WHO HAS- EXPRESSED CONCERNS WITH- CURRENTLY THE EDT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. IN PLACE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST- REPORTS WHERE THEY- EXPRESSED SOME OTHER PRIORITY CONCERNS THAT NEEDED TO ADDRESS TWO EDT WHICH WE HAVE YET TO COMPLETELY- IMPLEMENTED. I FEEL WE SHOULD PROBABLY DIRECT OUR EFFORTS OUR TIME AND OUR RESOURCES IN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS- TOP PRIORITIES IN ORDER FOR US TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE. AND MORE EFFICIENT IN THE PROCESSES EDP SO I WHILE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS MERIT I THINK WE DO HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE DO HAVE TO. ADDRESS FIRST BEFORE WE ADD YET ANOTHER REQUIREMENT TO EDT- IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT AT THIS TIME I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I AM A HUGE PROPONENT. OF TRYING TO GATHER DATA IN ORDER TO BEST ABOUT YOU- BEST. BASICALLY HAVE BEST PRACTICES IN PLACE FOR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT.
